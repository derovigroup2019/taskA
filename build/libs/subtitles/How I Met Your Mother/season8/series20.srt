1
00:00:02,528 --> 00:00:04,685
<i>Kids, in April of 2013,</i>

2
00:00:04,785 --> 00:00:06,535
<i>your mother and I were</i>
<i>very close</i>

3
00:00:06,537 --> 00:00:08,153
<i>and yet very far apart.</i>

4
00:00:08,155 --> 00:00:10,756
<i>I was living on</i>
<i>West 82nd Street.</i>

5
00:00:10,758 --> 00:00:12,925
<i>She was up on West 115th.</i>

6
00:00:12,927 --> 00:00:15,493
<i>She was getting</i>
<i>a degree in economics.</i>

7
00:00:15,495 --> 00:00:17,513
<i>I was teaching architecture.</i>

8
00:00:17,515 --> 00:00:18,714
<i>I was always at MacLaren's.</i>

9
00:00:18,716 --> 00:00:20,132
<i>She was always...</i>

10
00:00:20,134 --> 00:00:22,217
<i>not spending</i>
<i>all her time in a bar.</i>

11
00:00:22,219 --> 00:00:25,420
<i>She was dating some</i>
<i>finance guy named Louis.</i>

12
00:00:25,422 --> 00:00:27,439
<i>And I...</i>

13
00:00:27,441 --> 00:00:29,892
<i>I was alone.</i>

14
00:00:31,895 --> 00:00:33,312
Ted, get ready
to be surrounded by

15
00:00:33,314 --> 00:00:35,197
half-naked,
grease-covered bodies.

16
00:00:35,199 --> 00:00:37,733
And by grease,
I mean motor grease.

17
00:00:37,735 --> 00:00:41,153
We're going to
<i>Robots vs. Wrestlers!</i>

18
00:00:41,155 --> 00:00:44,323
<i>Kids, you remember</i>
Robots vs. Wrestlers.

19
00:00:44,325 --> 00:00:45,240
Forget everything
you remember

20
00:00:45,242 --> 00:00:46,491
about <i>Robots</i>
<i>vs. Wrestlers.</i>

21
00:00:46,493 --> 00:00:50,045
This is <i>Robots vs. Wrestlers:</i>
<i>"Legends."</i>

22
00:00:50,047 --> 00:00:53,298
Elderly wrestlers
fighting old-timey robots

23
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:55,367
in a wheelchair-accessible
wrestling ring.

24
00:00:55,369 --> 00:00:57,869
Why are we still sitting here?

25
00:00:57,871 --> 00:00:59,087
I got a big lecture tomorrow.

26
00:00:59,089 --> 00:01:00,538
Think I'm gonna
take it easy tonight.

27
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:02,758
Ted, trust me,
20 years from now,

28
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:06,445
you'll be glad you saw
<i>Robots vs. Wrestlers: Legends.</i>

29
00:01:06,447 --> 00:01:08,981
I can't imagine
a world where that's possible.

30
00:01:08,983 --> 00:01:09,982
I'm serious.

31
00:01:09,984 --> 00:01:11,233
20 years from now,

32
00:01:11,235 --> 00:01:13,602
when my 26-year-old third wife
asks me about this...

33
00:01:13,604 --> 00:01:15,070
You make a lot of those jokes.

34
00:01:15,072 --> 00:01:16,305
I'm gonna say,

35
00:01:16,307 --> 00:01:18,423
"Yeah, it was awesome,
but you know the funny thing?

36
00:01:18,425 --> 00:01:20,442
Ted almost didn't go."
Hmm.

37
00:01:20,444 --> 00:01:22,894
"But thank God he did,
because it was a great night."

38
00:01:22,896 --> 00:01:24,062
And then she
and I will

39
00:01:24,064 --> 00:01:25,397
adjourn to the Jacuzzi,

40
00:01:25,399 --> 00:01:27,399
where my fourth wife
will be waiting for us,

41
00:01:27,401 --> 00:01:28,900
already warming herself
up on the jets.

42
00:01:28,902 --> 00:01:30,619
Oh, Robin's here--
I'll tell you the rest later.

43
00:01:30,621 --> 00:01:32,570
Please do,
that story could go anywhere.

44
00:01:32,572 --> 00:01:33,538
Mwah.

45
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:34,923
Hey, hello.
Hey.

46
00:01:34,925 --> 00:01:36,041
Here we are
at the bar

47
00:01:36,043 --> 00:01:37,242
once more.

48
00:01:38,094 --> 00:01:39,428
"What will I have to drink?"
you ask.

49
00:01:39,430 --> 00:01:40,462
Hmm.

50
00:01:40,464 --> 00:01:41,579
Minnesota Tidal Wave.

51
00:01:41,581 --> 00:01:43,098
"What's that?" you ask.

52
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:44,216
Only the best cocktail ever.

53
00:01:44,218 --> 00:01:45,884
"Who invented it?" you ask.

54
00:01:46,419 --> 00:01:47,603
Me.

55
00:01:47,605 --> 00:01:49,271
And it's not
a girly drink.

56
00:01:49,273 --> 00:01:50,689
Lily, why would
you even say that?

57
00:01:50,691 --> 00:01:52,424
Girly drink.

58
00:01:52,426 --> 00:01:54,610
Hey, I am the least
girly girl on Earth,

59
00:01:54,612 --> 00:01:56,395
and I love
the Minnesota Tidal Wave.

60
00:01:56,397 --> 00:01:57,813
Thank you, Robin.

61
00:01:57,815 --> 00:01:59,731
Matter of fact,
I'm going to go order one

62
00:01:59,733 --> 00:02:01,599
right now
with my head held high.

63
00:02:01,601 --> 00:02:02,600
Lily.

64
00:02:02,602 --> 00:02:04,069
You want me to
order it for you?

65
00:02:04,071 --> 00:02:05,270
Yes, please,
thank you, baby.

66
00:02:08,858 --> 00:02:10,993
Ted, let me tell you
the secret to life.

67
00:02:10,995 --> 00:02:12,110
Hmm.

68
00:02:12,112 --> 00:02:13,912
Every time I make a decision
about what to do

69
00:02:13,914 --> 00:02:16,081
on a given night, I ask myself,

70
00:02:16,083 --> 00:02:19,751
"What would make the best memory
20 years from now?"

71
00:02:19,753 --> 00:02:22,955
So I let 20-Years-From-Now-
Barney call the shots.

72
00:02:22,957 --> 00:02:24,289
And it always works out.

73
00:02:24,291 --> 00:02:26,425
And 20-Years-From-Now-Barney

74
00:02:26,427 --> 00:02:28,810
thinks we should go
to <i>Robots vs. Wrestlers?</i>

75
00:02:28,812 --> 00:02:29,828
I don't know.

76
00:02:29,830 --> 00:02:30,796
Let's ask him.

77
00:02:30,798 --> 00:02:31,980
Close your eyes, Ted.

78
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:35,550
Okay, now open them.

79
00:02:35,552 --> 00:02:36,518
Barney, I swear to God,

80
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:37,969
if I open my eyes
and your bare ass

81
00:02:37,971 --> 00:02:39,521
is an inch away
from my face again...

82
00:02:39,523 --> 00:02:42,007
Just open your eyes.

83
00:02:46,079 --> 00:02:47,896
Ted, I'd like you to meet
20-Years-From-Now-Barney.

84
00:02:47,898 --> 00:02:49,581
20-Years-From-Now-Barney,
you remember Ted.

85
00:02:49,583 --> 00:02:51,700
'Sup?

86
00:02:51,766 --> 00:02:55,766

88
00:03:04,514 --> 00:03:05,847
Hey, Ted.

89
00:03:05,849 --> 00:03:07,065
What's this
I hear-slash-remember

90
00:03:07,067 --> 00:03:10,235
about you not wanting to
see <i>Robots vs. Wrestlers?</i>

91
00:03:10,237 --> 00:03:12,020
Yeah, it's just that I
don't want to see it.

92
00:03:12,022 --> 00:03:14,022
You don't...
I know.

93
00:03:14,024 --> 00:03:15,107
He doesn't...
I know.

94
00:03:16,310 --> 00:03:20,195
Ted, trust us,
it's gonna be legend--

95
00:03:20,197 --> 00:03:22,397
wait 20 years for it...

96
00:03:22,399 --> 00:03:23,348
...dary!

97
00:03:23,350 --> 00:03:25,784
Legendary!
Legendary!

98
00:03:25,786 --> 00:03:26,902
Okay, uh,
I'm gonna go home.

99
00:03:26,904 --> 00:03:28,036
No, Ted, look.
Come on!

100
00:03:28,038 --> 00:03:29,204
If you don't
believe that

101
00:03:29,206 --> 00:03:30,355
<i>Robots vs. Wrestlers</i>

102
00:03:30,357 --> 00:03:31,907
is gonna be
a life-changing event,

103
00:03:31,909 --> 00:03:35,711
maybe you'll believe
20-Years-From-Now-Ted.

104
00:03:36,830 --> 00:03:37,846
Whoa.

105
00:03:37,848 --> 00:03:39,214
'Sup?

106
00:03:39,216 --> 00:03:40,198
Wow.

107
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:42,367
Wow, so many
things all at once.

108
00:03:42,369 --> 00:03:43,868
But most
importantly...

109
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:45,420
I don't go bald?

110
00:03:45,422 --> 00:03:47,039
Nope.

111
00:03:47,041 --> 00:03:48,223
And neither do I.

112
00:03:48,225 --> 00:03:49,374
Eeh...

113
00:03:49,376 --> 00:03:51,876
Ted, listen to me.

114
00:03:51,878 --> 00:03:54,429
You, listen to you.

115
00:03:54,431 --> 00:03:56,181
Me.

116
00:03:56,183 --> 00:03:58,350
You got to go to <i>Robots</i>
<i>vs. Wrestlers: Legends.</i>

117
00:03:58,352 --> 00:04:00,602
Trust me,
you will regret it if you don't.

118
00:04:00,604 --> 00:04:02,104
So, what,
do I go bald or something?

119
00:04:02,106 --> 00:04:03,221
Is that a toupee?

120
00:04:03,223 --> 00:04:04,222
Ted,

121
00:04:04,224 --> 00:04:05,524
scalp check!
Can't Robin do this?

122
00:04:05,526 --> 00:04:07,109
Come on, you've been
doing it for years.

123
00:04:07,111 --> 00:04:08,443
You know the frame
of reference.

124
00:04:08,445 --> 00:04:09,745
Scalp check!

125
00:04:11,330 --> 00:04:12,748
Hmm, that's odd.

126
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:15,667
Little early in the week
for scalp check.

127
00:04:15,669 --> 00:04:16,901
Five tablespoons of sugar,

128
00:04:16,903 --> 00:04:19,121
a whisper
of vanilla vodka

129
00:04:19,123 --> 00:04:20,172
and you're done.

130
00:04:20,174 --> 00:04:21,873
Maraschino cherries.

131
00:04:21,875 --> 00:04:24,543
Oh, and a handful of
maraschino cherries on top.

132
00:04:24,545 --> 00:04:26,344
Wait, you're ordering
a Robin Scherbatsky.

133
00:04:26,346 --> 00:04:27,512
Why didn't you just say that?

134
00:04:29,349 --> 00:04:31,183
One second
there, barkeep.

135
00:04:31,185 --> 00:04:32,083
Unless I'm mistaken,

136
00:04:32,085 --> 00:04:33,635
the drink this
lady just ordered

137
00:04:33,637 --> 00:04:36,304
is called the
Minnesota Tidal Wave.

138
00:04:36,306 --> 00:04:38,039
Origin unknown.

139
00:04:38,041 --> 00:04:40,392
Oh, well, you know, Robin's been
ordering them so much lately

140
00:04:40,394 --> 00:04:41,610
that we named it after her.

141
00:04:41,612 --> 00:04:43,678
You named a drink after me?

142
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,113
Right there in the menu.

143
00:04:45,115 --> 00:04:46,431
Congrats.

144
00:04:53,706 --> 00:04:55,957
I can't drink this.

145
00:04:55,959 --> 00:04:57,209
That's better.

146
00:04:57,211 --> 00:04:59,944
I'm still seething,
but that's better.

147
00:05:01,131 --> 00:05:02,631
Okay,
20-Years-From-Now-Me,

148
00:05:02,633 --> 00:05:04,216
level with me.

149
00:05:04,218 --> 00:05:06,718
You. Us.

150
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,503
Is <i>Robots vs.</i>
<i>Wrestlers</i> worth it?

151
00:05:08,505 --> 00:05:11,056
It was the single
greatest night of my life.

152
00:05:11,058 --> 00:05:12,724
Even greater
than your wedding?

153
00:05:12,726 --> 00:05:14,860
Well, I mean,
when I get married,

154
00:05:14,862 --> 00:05:16,511
that'll be the
greatest night of my life.

155
00:05:16,513 --> 00:05:18,180
But who knows when
that's going to happen?

156
00:05:18,182 --> 00:05:20,315
Oh, my God, you
still haven't...

157
00:05:20,317 --> 00:05:21,800
Man, I hope
I meet her soon.

158
00:05:21,802 --> 00:05:23,652
Oh, God, what is
wrong with me?!

159
00:05:23,654 --> 00:05:25,020
I'm sorry!

160
00:05:25,022 --> 00:05:26,655
I'm just messing
with you!

161
00:05:26,657 --> 00:05:28,857
Now, come on, are
we going or what?

162
00:05:28,859 --> 00:05:30,575
Fine, let's go.

163
00:05:30,577 --> 00:05:31,776
Yeah!

164
00:05:32,612 --> 00:05:34,079
Not so fast.

165
00:05:34,081 --> 00:05:36,798
Barney, Ted,
20-Years-From-Now-Barney,

166
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,099
20-Years-From-Now-Ted.

167
00:05:38,101 --> 00:05:38,934
Who are you?

168
00:05:38,936 --> 00:05:41,720
I'm 20-Hours-From-Now-Ted.

169
00:05:41,722 --> 00:05:44,322
And you bastards
aren't going anywhere.

170
00:05:49,578 --> 00:05:51,776
So, you're the Ted
from 20 hours from now?

171
00:05:51,876 --> 00:05:52,859
Shh.

172
00:05:52,861 --> 00:05:55,445
Just... shh.

173
00:05:55,447 --> 00:05:56,529
You okay?

174
00:05:56,531 --> 00:05:58,131
No, I'm not okay.

175
00:05:58,133 --> 00:06:00,750
This dummy's about to go
to <i>Robots vs. Wrestlers--</i>

176
00:06:00,752 --> 00:06:02,368
and yes, it'll be awesome...

177
00:06:02,370 --> 00:06:04,487
See?

178
00:06:04,489 --> 00:06:05,571
...at first.

179
00:06:05,573 --> 00:06:07,206
But then
you're gonna drink way too much,

180
00:06:07,208 --> 00:06:09,158
hence the headache.

181
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,460
Then you're gonna
jump into the ring

182
00:06:10,462 --> 00:06:12,628
and sprain your wrist,
hence the splint.

183
00:06:12,630 --> 00:06:13,679
And then afterwards,
you're gonna smoke

184
00:06:13,681 --> 00:06:14,997
half a pack of cigarettes,
hence the...

185
00:06:16,167 --> 00:06:18,301
Well, that's the sound
a good time.

186
00:06:18,303 --> 00:06:20,803
And 20 hours from now,
when you're me,

187
00:06:20,805 --> 00:06:21,804
you're gonna want
to come back here,

188
00:06:21,806 --> 00:06:24,390
right to this very spot,
right now,

189
00:06:24,392 --> 00:06:26,008
and smack yourself
upside the head.

190
00:06:26,010 --> 00:06:27,477
Yeah, but obviously
I wouldn't do that

191
00:06:27,479 --> 00:06:28,644
'cause I'd only be
smacking myself--

192
00:06:28,646 --> 00:06:30,346
Ow!

193
00:06:30,348 --> 00:06:33,599
Don't do this to me, Ted.
Don't do this to us.

194
00:06:33,601 --> 00:06:35,535
Don't listen to yourself,
Present-Day-Ted.

195
00:06:35,537 --> 00:06:38,654
It's a day of pain
for a lifetime of memories.

196
00:06:38,656 --> 00:06:40,289
20-Hours-From-Now-Me,

197
00:06:40,291 --> 00:06:43,409
just tell me one
thing: do I hurl?

198
00:06:43,411 --> 00:06:45,578
Yeah, kid.

199
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:47,213
You hurl.

200
00:06:47,215 --> 00:06:48,364
A lot?

201
00:06:48,366 --> 00:06:50,083
Remember when Mom

202
00:06:50,085 --> 00:06:52,418
bought the beef
from the Price Club?

203
00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:54,504
Okay, how about this:

204
00:06:54,506 --> 00:06:56,722
we go to
<i>Robots vs. Wrestlers,</i>

205
00:06:56,724 --> 00:06:59,642
but I don't
drink too much?

206
00:06:59,644 --> 00:07:00,960
Interesting.

207
00:07:00,962 --> 00:07:01,978
I'm good with that.

208
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:03,212
No, forget it.

209
00:07:03,214 --> 00:07:04,647
If Ted
doesn't get wasted,

210
00:07:04,649 --> 00:07:06,182
there's no way
he'll end up making out

211
00:07:06,184 --> 00:07:08,651
with that surprisingly
realistic-looking female robot.

212
00:07:08,653 --> 00:07:10,553
Wait, I kiss
a female robot?

213
00:07:10,555 --> 00:07:12,021
Oh, you do a lot
more than that.

214
00:07:12,023 --> 00:07:15,191
Now, look, nobody is
saying you need alcohol

215
00:07:15,193 --> 00:07:17,160
to have an exciting
and memorable night.

216
00:07:17,162 --> 00:07:19,245
Absolutely not.
Absolutely not.

217
00:07:19,247 --> 00:07:21,998
But in this case, yeah,
you kind of have to be wasted.

218
00:07:24,285 --> 00:07:26,002
You drink beers
in cans still.

219
00:07:26,004 --> 00:07:27,620
It makes the robot scarier.

220
00:07:28,505 --> 00:07:30,256
They named
my drink after her.

221
00:07:30,258 --> 00:07:31,624
The Minnesota Tidal Wave.

222
00:07:31,626 --> 00:07:32,875
It's my usual.

223
00:07:32,877 --> 00:07:34,093
Immaterial!

224
00:07:34,095 --> 00:07:35,711
If it's gonna be named
after anybody,

225
00:07:35,713 --> 00:07:37,513
it should be called
The Marshall Eriksen.

226
00:07:37,515 --> 00:07:39,599
Sorry, it's
The Robin Scherbatsky.

227
00:07:39,601 --> 00:07:40,749
Read it and weep.

228
00:07:40,751 --> 00:07:42,418
Oh, so you're gonna
Zuckerberg me?

229
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:43,352
That it?

230
00:07:43,354 --> 00:07:44,753
You're Zuckerberging me?

231
00:07:44,755 --> 00:07:45,454
That's fine.

232
00:07:45,456 --> 00:07:47,106
I'll see you in court.

233
00:07:47,108 --> 00:07:49,158
Little court known
as the dance floor.

234
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:50,693
Dance-off. Now.

235
00:07:50,695 --> 00:07:51,760
No, no dancing.

236
00:07:51,762 --> 00:07:53,596
Marshall,
we've been through this.

237
00:07:53,598 --> 00:07:55,598
The doctor said your
dancer's hip is worse than ever.

238
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,617
You have to lay off dancing
for a while.

239
00:07:57,619 --> 00:07:59,452
You're killing me, Lily!

240
00:07:59,454 --> 00:08:01,487
You're killing me!

241
00:08:01,489 --> 00:08:02,605
I'm an adult.

242
00:08:02,607 --> 00:08:04,123
You have to let me dance
my own battles.

243
00:08:04,125 --> 00:08:05,875
Marshall, there's not gonna be
a dance-off

244
00:08:05,877 --> 00:08:07,109
because the name is staying.

245
00:08:07,111 --> 00:08:09,445
Period, end of story.

246
00:08:09,447 --> 00:08:12,632
I just like having
my name on something.

247
00:08:12,634 --> 00:08:14,050
Oh, you do?

248
00:08:14,052 --> 00:08:16,085
Oh, that's great, Robin.

249
00:08:16,087 --> 00:08:18,087
Then that's what you will get.

250
00:08:18,089 --> 00:08:20,173
That's...

251
00:08:20,175 --> 00:08:22,175
what you...

252
00:08:22,177 --> 00:08:24,560
will get.

253
00:08:26,129 --> 00:08:28,598
Mmm, mmm-mmm-mmm.

254
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:30,316
Oh, hey, Robin.

255
00:08:30,318 --> 00:08:32,301
You here "for a good time"?

256
00:08:32,303 --> 00:08:34,237
Classic.

257
00:08:34,239 --> 00:08:35,804
Did you write my number
in the men's room?

258
00:08:35,806 --> 00:08:38,107
It...
Well, I don't know.

259
00:08:38,109 --> 00:08:39,642
I guess you'll never know
unless you go in there,

260
00:08:39,644 --> 00:08:40,776
which I highly
doubt that...

261
00:08:40,778 --> 00:08:42,111
There she goes.

262
00:08:42,113 --> 00:08:43,646
Okay, boys.

263
00:08:43,648 --> 00:08:46,482
Close your eyes
and zip your flies.

264
00:08:52,372 --> 00:08:54,657
Hi. Don't mind me.

265
00:08:57,377 --> 00:08:59,011
I don't think
you should have done that.

266
00:08:59,013 --> 00:09:01,297
Lily, I know what I'm doing,
all right?

267
00:09:01,299 --> 00:09:02,431
I'm a lawyer.

268
00:09:02,433 --> 00:09:04,050
I've thought about
every possible scenario.

269
00:09:04,052 --> 00:09:05,551
I'm ten steps ahead of...

270
00:09:08,004 --> 00:09:09,639
Where's she going?

271
00:09:09,641 --> 00:09:11,057
Probably into the ladies' room

272
00:09:11,059 --> 00:09:12,675
to write something on the wall
about you.

273
00:09:12,677 --> 00:09:14,060
Nobody writes things

274
00:09:14,062 --> 00:09:15,361
on the walls
of the ladies' room.

275
00:09:15,363 --> 00:09:17,029
Have you been
in the ladies' room?

276
00:09:17,031 --> 00:09:18,447
Of course not.

277
00:09:18,449 --> 00:09:21,350
Lily, I know that I have the
sexual charisma of a bad boy,

278
00:09:21,352 --> 00:09:24,737
but I certainly don't have
the manners of one.

279
00:09:26,073 --> 00:09:27,022
What'd you write in there?

280
00:09:27,024 --> 00:09:29,158
Why don't you
go in and look?

281
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:31,360
You know I can't do that, Robin.

282
00:09:31,362 --> 00:09:32,545
Lily, can you go look?

283
00:09:32,547 --> 00:09:35,915
Oh, I thought you wanted
to dance your own battles.

284
00:09:37,050 --> 00:09:39,585
Ladies,
put your blouses back on!

285
00:09:39,587 --> 00:09:42,672
I'm coming in!

286
00:09:47,261 --> 00:09:48,644
<i>Dear Marshall,</i>

287
00:09:48,646 --> 00:09:50,746
<i>I know this is a strange way</i>
<i>to apologize,</i>

288
00:09:50,748 --> 00:09:54,150
<i>but I'm sorry I let Carl</i>
<i>name your drink after me.</i>

289
00:09:54,152 --> 00:09:55,818
<i>Why didn't I say something?</i>

290
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:58,387
<i>Gosh, I guess that goes back</i>
<i>to my childhood.</i>

291
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:01,057
Okay, guys.

292
00:10:01,059 --> 00:10:04,076
Let's go to
<i>Robots vs. Wrestlers.</i>

293
00:10:04,078 --> 00:10:04,944
Huzzah!
Now you're talking!

294
00:10:04,946 --> 00:10:05,894
Here we go.

295
00:10:05,896 --> 00:10:07,163
Nope, sit down.

296
00:10:07,165 --> 00:10:08,664
Everybody sit down.

297
00:10:08,666 --> 00:10:09,749
Okay, who are you?

298
00:10:09,751 --> 00:10:12,702
Hello, Ted, Barney,
20-Hours-From-Now-Ted,

299
00:10:12,704 --> 00:10:14,920
20-Years-From-Now-Ted,
20-Years-From-Now-Barney.

300
00:10:14,922 --> 00:10:16,422
Hey, how's it going?

301
00:10:16,424 --> 00:10:18,374
Allow me to introduce myself.

302
00:10:18,376 --> 00:10:20,543
I'm 20-Minutes-From-Now-Barney,

303
00:10:20,545 --> 00:10:22,378
and I have got something
very important to...

304
00:10:23,464 --> 00:10:25,548
What's the stain
on your shirt, bro?

305
00:10:25,550 --> 00:10:27,767
Please, please, I really do have
something very important to...

306
00:10:28,936 --> 00:10:30,919
You look stupid.

307
00:10:30,921 --> 00:10:32,254
Here's your spaghetti.

308
00:10:32,256 --> 00:10:34,056
And be careful...

309
00:10:35,609 --> 00:10:37,310
...with the meatball.

310
00:10:39,446 --> 00:10:41,864
<i>And that's the only time</i>
<i>my father</i>

311
00:10:41,866 --> 00:10:43,599
<i>ever said he was proud of me.</i>

312
00:10:43,601 --> 00:10:46,535
<i>Maybe that's why I stole credit</i>
<i>for your drink.</i>

313
00:10:46,537 --> 00:10:47,620
<i>Maybe that's why</i>

314
00:10:47,622 --> 00:10:50,289
<i>I needed to pour my heart out</i>
<i>like this.</i>

315
00:10:50,291 --> 00:10:52,925
<i>Or, maybe I wrote this</i>
<i>so you'd be in here long enough</i>

316
00:10:52,927 --> 00:10:55,294
<i>for a lady to walk in,</i>
<i>causing you to freak out</i>

317
00:10:55,296 --> 00:10:56,479
<i>and hide in the stall.</i>

318
00:10:57,665 --> 00:10:59,415
So, you got a text message?
Yeah.

319
00:11:02,886 --> 00:11:03,952
Whoa.

320
00:11:03,954 --> 00:11:07,023
Try to get some
in your mouth next time.

321
00:11:07,025 --> 00:11:09,091
Okay, everybody, listen up.

322
00:11:09,093 --> 00:11:10,159
When I walked in here,

323
00:11:10,161 --> 00:11:11,694
I was 20-Minutes-
From-Now-Barney.

324
00:11:11,696 --> 00:11:13,162
But that was 19 minutes

325
00:11:13,164 --> 00:11:14,697
and some serious
acid reflux--

326
00:11:14,699 --> 00:11:17,500
who orders spaghetti
at an Irish bar?-- ago.

327
00:11:17,502 --> 00:11:18,634
Now,

328
00:11:18,636 --> 00:11:20,319
I'm 20-Seconds-
From-Now-Barney,

329
00:11:20,321 --> 00:11:22,321
and I'm telling you,
watch that door.

330
00:11:22,323 --> 00:11:23,155
Why?

331
00:11:23,157 --> 00:11:26,258
That's why.

332
00:11:27,627 --> 00:11:29,395
Um, oh.

333
00:11:29,397 --> 00:11:32,314
In-in, like,
12 seconds.

334
00:11:34,334 --> 00:11:36,252
Your skin looks great.

335
00:11:36,254 --> 00:11:37,703
Thanks.

336
00:11:37,705 --> 00:11:40,005
And thank you for taking
such good care of it.

337
00:11:40,007 --> 00:11:41,156
Shh.

338
00:11:41,158 --> 00:11:42,958
That's why.

339
00:11:53,409 --> 00:11:54,409
Who is that?

340
00:11:54,411 --> 00:11:55,677
She's the coat check girl

341
00:11:55,679 --> 00:11:57,979
from that dance club
we went to seven years ago.

342
00:11:57,981 --> 00:11:59,314
You remember that night.

343
00:11:59,316 --> 00:12:00,765
When Barney grinded
with his cousin.

344
00:12:00,767 --> 00:12:03,685
Oh, man, you remember that
20 years from now?

345
00:12:03,687 --> 00:12:05,653
He won't let anyone forget.

346
00:12:05,655 --> 00:12:06,788
Coat check girl.

347
00:12:06,790 --> 00:12:09,140
I always meant to go
back to that club

348
00:12:09,142 --> 00:12:11,309
and get her number,
but I didn't.

349
00:12:11,311 --> 00:12:13,428
And now she's here?

350
00:12:13,430 --> 00:12:16,731
She's in this bar
seven years later?

351
00:12:16,733 --> 00:12:18,616
I-I can't believe this.

352
00:12:18,618 --> 00:12:20,869
So, wait, do you guys think
I should go talk to her?

353
00:12:20,871 --> 00:12:22,537
Are you kidding me?
Yes, go...

354
00:12:22,539 --> 00:12:23,604
How many different ways...
Idiot.

355
00:12:23,606 --> 00:12:26,658
Hello?

356
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:29,711
Is anybody out there?

357
00:12:32,131 --> 00:12:34,916
Sounds like the coast is clear.

358
00:12:38,671 --> 00:12:40,621
No, no, wait!

359
00:12:40,623 --> 00:12:41,622
Please, it's not my fault!

360
00:12:41,624 --> 00:12:42,841
I was tricked!

361
00:12:42,843 --> 00:12:44,175
Not cool, Marshall.

362
00:12:44,177 --> 00:12:45,643
This is a nice bar.

363
00:12:45,645 --> 00:12:47,846
Girls come here, they just want
to relax with their friends,

364
00:12:47,848 --> 00:12:50,148
maybe have
a few Robin Scherbatskys,

365
00:12:50,150 --> 00:12:51,632
and not have to
worry out some guy

366
00:12:51,634 --> 00:12:54,686
pulling a Marshall Eriksen
in the bathroom.

367
00:12:54,688 --> 00:12:57,655
No, no, no, I know. I just...

368
00:12:57,657 --> 00:13:01,476
Wait a minute,
did you just use my name

369
00:13:01,478 --> 00:13:03,661
as shorthand
for a guy being creepy?

370
00:13:03,663 --> 00:13:04,746
Yep.

371
00:13:04,748 --> 00:13:06,147
Well, you know what, Carl?

372
00:13:06,149 --> 00:13:07,866
I think that you are making

373
00:13:07,868 --> 00:13:09,701
a broad
and prejudicial assumption.

374
00:13:09,703 --> 00:13:12,087
So next time I meet a guy
who just goes around

375
00:13:12,089 --> 00:13:13,654
rushing to judgment,
I'm gonna say,

376
00:13:13,656 --> 00:13:16,875
"Hey, that guy's being
a real Carl..."

377
00:13:18,827 --> 00:13:21,346
You don't know my last name.

378
00:13:21,348 --> 00:13:23,348
You've been drinking
here for years,

379
00:13:23,350 --> 00:13:24,632
and you don't know my last name.

380
00:13:24,634 --> 00:13:27,936
I will name every drink
in this bar after you

381
00:13:27,938 --> 00:13:30,105
if you can tell me my last name.

382
00:13:30,107 --> 00:13:31,189
Well, that just seems confusing.

383
00:13:31,191 --> 00:13:33,141
How will you know
what people are ordering?

384
00:13:34,143 --> 00:13:35,477
What's my last name, Marshall?

385
00:13:35,479 --> 00:13:37,612
It's Carl...

386
00:13:43,035 --> 00:13:44,536
...'s Junior.

387
00:13:45,571 --> 00:13:47,455
Okay, wish me luck,
everyone.

388
00:13:47,457 --> 00:13:49,690
Break a leg...

389
00:13:57,967 --> 00:14:00,218
What the hell?

390
00:14:01,703 --> 00:14:03,221
Do not talk to her.

391
00:14:03,223 --> 00:14:04,556
What-what... Who are you?

392
00:14:04,558 --> 00:14:07,208
We are 20-Months-From-Now-
Coat-Check-Girl.

393
00:14:07,210 --> 00:14:08,426
But there's two of you.

394
00:14:08,428 --> 00:14:10,728
Right, because if you go
over there and you talk to her,

395
00:14:10,730 --> 00:14:12,764
20 months from now, it's gonna
end in one of two ways.

396
00:14:12,766 --> 00:14:14,599
Either you are gonna
get sick of me.

397
00:14:14,601 --> 00:14:16,017
I made you muffins

398
00:14:16,019 --> 00:14:18,553
because of your
nickname: Muffin.

399
00:14:18,555 --> 00:14:20,188
Or...

400
00:14:20,190 --> 00:14:22,574
I am gonna get sick of you
and your stupid habits.

401
00:14:22,576 --> 00:14:24,659
Stop DVR-ing the news.
You're never gonna catch up.

402
00:14:24,661 --> 00:14:25,693
Oh, stop it,

403
00:14:25,695 --> 00:14:27,095
you're scaring him off.

404
00:14:27,097 --> 00:14:28,913
By the way,
I'm pregnant.

405
00:14:28,915 --> 00:14:30,114
No, she's not.

406
00:14:30,116 --> 00:14:31,199
Okay, no, I'm not,

407
00:14:31,201 --> 00:14:33,117
but that made you happy
for a second, right?

408
00:14:33,902 --> 00:14:35,386
Please shut up.
Okay, wait,

409
00:14:35,388 --> 00:14:38,206
so you're saying
it's doomed completely?

410
00:14:38,208 --> 00:14:41,092
One of us is just guaranteed
to get sick of the other

411
00:14:41,094 --> 00:14:42,677
and call it quits?

412
00:14:42,679 --> 00:14:44,579
You've been dating
for a long time, Ted.

413
00:14:44,581 --> 00:14:47,232
Has it ever gone
any other way?

414
00:15:09,206 --> 00:15:10,288
Look at this one.

415
00:15:10,290 --> 00:15:11,439
Thank you so much.

416
00:15:11,441 --> 00:15:12,657
Hey.

417
00:15:12,659 --> 00:15:14,142
Hey, you look kind of down.

418
00:15:14,144 --> 00:15:17,662
Have a Robin Scherbatsky,
on me.

419
00:15:17,664 --> 00:15:20,448
None of this would have happened
if Lily had let me dance.

420
00:15:22,135 --> 00:15:24,752
Baby, wait.

421
00:15:24,754 --> 00:15:26,087
God, you're still clinging
to that?

422
00:15:26,089 --> 00:15:27,555
Marshall, it doesn't matter,

423
00:15:27,557 --> 00:15:29,841
'cause you'd lose anyway,
and you know why?

424
00:15:29,843 --> 00:15:31,759
'Cause I'm Sparkles,
bitch.

425
00:15:31,761 --> 00:15:33,928
Oh, and you think
you can step to me?

426
00:15:33,930 --> 00:15:35,897
You think you can step
up to the streets?

427
00:15:35,899 --> 00:15:37,181
To me?

428
00:15:37,183 --> 00:15:40,602
You think you can step up
over me to the streets?

429
00:15:40,604 --> 00:15:42,487
I guess we'll never know
because you are not allowed...

430
00:15:42,489 --> 00:15:43,471
Wait, wait.

431
00:15:44,807 --> 00:15:47,442
That's my jam.

432
00:15:47,444 --> 00:15:49,360
Who's playing my jam?

433
00:15:49,362 --> 00:15:51,195
? Like you carry dairy there
? <i>Carry dairy there</i> ?

434
00:15:51,197 --> 00:15:53,314
? Heinie heinie heinie ho
? <i>Heinie heinie heinie ho</i> ?

435
00:15:53,316 --> 00:15:55,583
? Work your derriere
? <i>Work your derriere</i> ?

436
00:15:55,585 --> 00:15:56,984
Dance-off.

437
00:15:56,986 --> 00:15:58,536
You're on.

438
00:15:59,638 --> 00:16:00,788
? Work that booty

439
00:16:00,790 --> 00:16:02,006
? Work that booty,
work that booty ?

440
00:16:02,008 --> 00:16:03,174
? Work that booty

441
00:16:03,176 --> 00:16:05,176
? You got that pretty
brown round ?

442
00:16:05,178 --> 00:16:07,428
? Want both hands
all on them chocolate mounds ?

443
00:16:07,430 --> 00:16:09,097
? Give you my Almond Joy...

444
00:16:09,099 --> 00:16:10,548
Oh.

445
00:16:10,550 --> 00:16:12,100
I think I'm gonna head home.

446
00:16:12,102 --> 00:16:13,384
I understand.

447
00:16:13,386 --> 00:16:15,103
What, you're not gonna try
and stop me?

448
00:16:15,105 --> 00:16:17,272
And how would I try
and stop you?

449
00:16:17,274 --> 00:16:20,608
I don't know, by telling me
life is short,

450
00:16:20,610 --> 00:16:22,610
and if you ever come
across a beautiful,

451
00:16:22,612 --> 00:16:24,195
exciting, crazy moment in it,

452
00:16:24,197 --> 00:16:26,281
you got to seize it
while you can

453
00:16:26,283 --> 00:16:27,682
before that moment's gone?

454
00:16:27,684 --> 00:16:31,069
Ted, this moment
already is gone.

455
00:16:32,121 --> 00:16:33,855
The whole
Minnesota Tidal Wave thing

456
00:16:33,857 --> 00:16:35,239
happened five years ago.

457
00:16:35,241 --> 00:16:36,624
It's just a memory.

458
00:16:36,626 --> 00:16:37,792
And the rest of this

459
00:16:37,794 --> 00:16:39,410
never happened.

460
00:16:39,412 --> 00:16:41,963
Right now, Marshall
and Lily are upstairs,

461
00:16:41,965 --> 00:16:43,881
trying to get Marvin
to go back to sleep.

462
00:16:43,883 --> 00:16:46,000
Robin and I are trying
to decide on a caterer.

463
00:16:46,002 --> 00:16:47,085
And you've been
sitting here

464
00:16:47,087 --> 00:16:49,120
all night,
staring at a single ticket

465
00:16:49,122 --> 00:16:50,805
to <i>Robots vs. Wrestlers</i>

466
00:16:50,807 --> 00:16:52,540
because the rest of us
couldn't come out.

467
00:16:52,542 --> 00:16:55,443
Look around, Ted.

468
00:16:55,445 --> 00:16:57,578
You're all alone.

469
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:07,188
<i>Kids, it's been almost 20 years</i>

470
00:17:07,190 --> 00:17:10,074
<i>since that cold April night</i>
<i>in 2013,</i>

471
00:17:10,076 --> 00:17:11,892
<i>and I can safely tell you,</i>

472
00:17:11,894 --> 00:17:15,496
<i>if I could go back in time</i>
<i>and relive that night,</i>

473
00:17:15,498 --> 00:17:19,701
<i>there's no way in hell</i>
<i>I'd go to</i> Robots vs. Wrestlers.

474
00:17:22,237 --> 00:17:25,840
<i>No, I'd go home.</i>

475
00:17:25,842 --> 00:17:27,709
<i>I'd go to my old apartment,</i>

476
00:17:27,711 --> 00:17:30,428
<i>see all my old furniture,</i>
<i>my old stuff.</i>

477
00:17:30,430 --> 00:17:32,547
<i>I'd see my old drafting table,</i>

478
00:17:32,549 --> 00:17:35,550
<i>where I sketched out</i>
<i>my first building.</i>

479
00:17:35,552 --> 00:17:36,917
<i>I'd sit on that old couch</i>

480
00:17:36,919 --> 00:17:39,604
<i>and smell the Indian food</i>
<i>cooking three stories below.</i>

481
00:17:39,606 --> 00:17:42,923
<i>I'd go to Lily</i>
<i>and Marshall's place,</i>

482
00:17:42,925 --> 00:17:45,810
<i>be back in that old living room</i>
<i>where so many things happened.</i>

483
00:17:45,812 --> 00:17:47,261
<i>I'd see the baby.</i>

484
00:17:47,263 --> 00:17:49,197
<i>I don't know if you can</i>
<i>picture me holding</i>

485
00:17:49,199 --> 00:17:51,983
<i>your six-foot-seven</i>
<i>cousin Marvin over my head,</i>

486
00:17:51,985 --> 00:17:54,152
<i>but back then I could.</i>

487
00:17:54,154 --> 00:17:56,287
<i>I'd go have a drink</i>
<i>with Barney and Robin,</i>

488
00:17:56,289 --> 00:17:58,156
<i>watch them fight</i>
<i>about their caterer</i>

489
00:17:58,158 --> 00:18:00,658
<i>or whatever it was they were</i>
<i>fighting about that night.</i>

490
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:03,944
<i>But none of those things</i>
<i>is the thing I'd do first.</i>

491
00:18:03,946 --> 00:18:07,999
<i>You know the thing</i>
<i>I'd do first?</i>

492
00:18:33,075 --> 00:18:35,076
Hi.

493
00:18:36,912 --> 00:18:40,147
I'm Ted Mosby.

494
00:18:40,149 --> 00:18:43,984
And exactly 45 days from now,

495
00:18:43,986 --> 00:18:46,671
you and I are gonna meet,

496
00:18:46,673 --> 00:18:49,090
and we're gonna fall in love,

497
00:18:49,092 --> 00:18:51,008
and we're gonna get married,

498
00:18:51,010 --> 00:18:54,512
and...
we're gonna have two kids.

499
00:18:54,514 --> 00:18:58,599
And we're gonna love them
and each other so much.

500
00:19:01,437 --> 00:19:04,138
All that is 45 days away.

501
00:19:07,392 --> 00:19:10,228
But I'm here now,

502
00:19:10,230 --> 00:19:13,314
I guess, because...

503
00:19:15,701 --> 00:19:19,320
I want those extra 45 days
with you.

504
00:19:19,322 --> 00:19:22,790
I want each one of them.

505
00:19:22,792 --> 00:19:24,709
Look, and if I can't have them,

506
00:19:24,711 --> 00:19:27,211
I'll take the 45 seconds
before your boyfriend shows up

507
00:19:27,213 --> 00:19:30,381
and punches me in the face,

508
00:19:30,383 --> 00:19:33,551
because...

509
00:19:33,553 --> 00:19:35,753
I love you.

510
00:19:35,755 --> 00:19:38,806
I'm always gonna love you,

511
00:19:38,808 --> 00:19:42,677
till the end of my days
and beyond.

512
00:19:44,513 --> 00:19:46,430
You'll see.

513
00:19:47,766 --> 00:19:49,600
Can I help you?

514
00:19:49,602 --> 00:19:52,353
Oh, hey, it's, uh, Louis, right?

515
00:19:52,355 --> 00:19:53,371
It's okay.

516
00:19:53,373 --> 00:19:54,655
It's fine, um...

517
00:19:54,657 --> 00:19:56,190
I'm in love
with your girlfriend,

518
00:19:56,192 --> 00:19:58,058
and, uh,
we're gonna get married.

519
00:19:58,060 --> 00:20:00,111
What?
Yeah.

520
00:20:25,171 --> 00:20:27,744
Okay, guys, I've been waiting
20 years for this.

521
00:20:27,844 --> 00:20:29,227
Just like we practiced.

522
00:20:29,229 --> 00:20:30,562
No mistakes, ready?

523
00:20:30,564 --> 00:20:33,314
One, two,
a-one, two, three, four.

524
00:20:33,538 --> 00:20:37,516
? Whoa-oh-oh-oh

525
00:20:37,616 --> 00:20:39,182
? For the longest

526
00:20:39,184 --> 00:20:41,401
? For the longest time
