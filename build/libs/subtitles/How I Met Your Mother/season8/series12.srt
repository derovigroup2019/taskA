1
00:00:01,436 --> 00:00:03,021
<i>With Christmas just around the corner,</i>

2
00:00:03,046 --> 00:00:06,728
<i>your Uncle Barney, gave me the</i>
<i>horrible gift of an unwanted secret.</i>

3
00:00:06,908 --> 00:00:08,343
Tomorrow night on the roof

4
00:00:08,344 --> 00:00:10,094
of the World Wide News
building--

5
00:00:10,096 --> 00:00:11,395
that's Patrice's favorite spot--

6
00:00:11,397 --> 00:00:13,264
I'm gonna ask her to marry me.

7
00:00:13,266 --> 00:00:15,499
Ah, poot-tu-tat!
You're jinxed.

8
00:00:15,501 --> 00:00:18,078
I'll unjinx you if you'll follow
these two rules:

9
00:00:18,178 --> 00:00:20,228
one: you can't try to talk me
out of it,

10
00:00:20,230 --> 00:00:24,900
and two: you can't tell anybody.
Agreed?

11
00:00:26,368 --> 00:00:28,319
Yeah that nod was a lie.

12
00:00:28,405 --> 00:00:30,937
You see Robin had been hurting
over Barney all fall.

13
00:00:31,304 --> 00:00:33,629
And as her friend,
I knew I had to tell her.

14
00:00:34,483 --> 00:00:36,521
I just had to find
the right moment.

15
00:00:38,842 --> 00:00:42,139
Uh, there he is!
The youngest architect ever

16
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:44,622
to build a skyscraper
in New York City!

17
00:00:44,624 --> 00:00:47,492
The shockingly still
single Ted Mosby.

18
00:00:47,494 --> 00:00:48,860
You hear that,
ladies?

19
00:00:48,862 --> 00:00:51,663
I can't believe
the GNB Tower opens tonight.

20
00:00:51,665 --> 00:00:54,966
Ted, your building finally
gets unveiled to the whole world.

21
00:00:54,968 --> 00:00:57,469
You hear that, ladies?!

22
00:00:57,471 --> 00:00:58,870
Nervous?

23
00:00:58,872 --> 00:01:01,539
Everything comes out of my
body in liquid form now.

24
00:01:01,541 --> 00:01:03,058
Ignore that, ladies.

25
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:04,876
Plus, I, I keep
having this nightmare

26
00:01:04,878 --> 00:01:07,045
where King Kong
shows up to the opening

27
00:01:07,047 --> 00:01:08,763
but refuses to climb
my building

28
00:01:08,765 --> 00:01:11,766
because, in his words,
"It's a bit derivative."

29
00:01:11,768 --> 00:01:14,402
Oh, stop it, tonight
is gonna be amazing.

30
00:01:14,404 --> 00:01:16,438
And we are definitely gonna be
there to toast you,

31
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:19,991
but we might have to leave
a little early if that's okay.

32
00:01:19,993 --> 00:01:23,194
My dad just gave us the most
amazing Christmas gift ever.

33
00:01:23,196 --> 00:01:25,897
Our first night away
since Marvin was born.

34
00:01:25,899 --> 00:01:29,233
24 hours straight without
that little bastard.

35
00:01:30,052 --> 00:01:32,135
We're maximizing
our time away

36
00:01:32,137 --> 00:01:34,754
by planning everything
down to the minute.

37
00:01:34,756 --> 00:01:36,106
See?

38
00:01:36,108 --> 00:01:37,774
2:12 p.m.-- guilt Ted

39
00:01:37,776 --> 00:01:40,026
into saying it's okay
if we leave early tonight.

40
00:01:41,979 --> 00:01:43,930
It's okay if you leave
early tonight.

41
00:01:43,932 --> 00:01:44,931
Look, I just

42
00:01:44,933 --> 00:01:46,533
appreciate you
showing up at all

43
00:01:46,535 --> 00:01:47,700
on your big night away.

44
00:01:47,702 --> 00:01:49,369
I mean, Barney's not
even gonna be there.

45
00:01:49,371 --> 00:01:50,370
What?

46
00:01:50,372 --> 00:01:52,072
This is the biggest
night of your career.

47
00:01:52,074 --> 00:01:53,373
Why isn't Barney coming?

48
00:01:53,475 --> 00:01:57,343
I don't know--
he said,

49
00:01:57,345 --> 00:02:00,096
"Legendary" and "Challenge
accepted," and then he winked.

50
00:02:00,098 --> 00:02:02,599
"Wait for it," you know,
all that stuff.

51
00:02:02,601 --> 00:02:03,850
That does sound like him.

52
00:02:03,852 --> 00:02:06,186
Well, we're your
real friends

53
00:02:06,188 --> 00:02:08,221
and we wouldn't miss
it for the world.

54
00:02:08,223 --> 00:02:11,407
That is why we will
see you tonight

55
00:02:11,409 --> 00:02:14,160
from 7:03 to 7:14.

56
00:02:14,262 --> 00:02:16,996
Bye, guys. Good night.
Bye.

57
00:02:16,998 --> 00:02:19,716
Okay, what's the real reason
Barney's not coming?

58
00:02:19,718 --> 00:02:24,020
<i>Here was my chance</i>
<i>to tell Robin about Barney.</i>

59
00:02:24,022 --> 00:02:28,191
Yeah, actually, Barney didn't
say what he was doing tonight.

60
00:02:28,193 --> 00:02:31,894
Anyway, uh, you know, I'm not
taking anyone to the opening,

61
00:02:31,896 --> 00:02:34,197
so you want to be my date?

62
00:02:34,199 --> 00:02:36,282
Sure.

63
00:02:37,964 --> 00:02:41,964

65
00:02:53,510 --> 00:02:55,228
Okay, Dad, I-I
made you a list

66
00:02:55,230 --> 00:02:57,497
of Marvin's nightly schedule
down to the minute.

67
00:02:57,499 --> 00:02:59,098
Okay.

68
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:02,735
Uh, "9:06 p.m.--
put on edible underwear."

69
00:03:02,737 --> 00:03:04,937
Wrong list, wrong list.

70
00:03:04,939 --> 00:03:07,273
Come on, relax.

71
00:03:07,275 --> 00:03:10,159
I know this little guy
like the back of my hand.

72
00:03:10,161 --> 00:03:13,229
Dear Lord, what is that?

73
00:03:14,831 --> 00:03:16,282
Oh, jam, okay.

74
00:03:16,284 --> 00:03:17,233
Just jam.

75
00:03:17,235 --> 00:03:20,253
Oh, I-I forgot
the lullaby.

76
00:03:20,255 --> 00:03:21,287
Do you know
Marvin's lullaby?

77
00:03:21,289 --> 00:03:22,788
We sing it
to him every night.

78
00:03:22,790 --> 00:03:25,625
? Night, night,
little Marvin ?

79
00:03:25,627 --> 00:03:28,127
? Stars twinkle for you

80
00:03:30,964 --> 00:03:33,633
? The Dreamland train's
a-chuggin' ?

81
00:03:34,968 --> 00:03:38,137
? All your dreams
will come true ?

82
00:03:38,139 --> 00:03:40,973
? And the horsie
says, "Good night" ?

83
00:03:42,976 --> 00:03:45,444
? And the birdie says,
"Good night" ?

84
00:03:48,198 --> 00:03:50,449
? And the elephant
says, "Good night" ?

85
00:03:52,569 --> 00:03:54,103
? And the skeleton playing
his own rib cage ?

86
00:03:54,105 --> 00:03:55,371
? Says, "Good Night"

87
00:03:57,491 --> 00:03:59,959
? And the robot says,
"Good night" ?

88
00:03:59,961 --> 00:04:01,744
Good night.

89
00:04:01,746 --> 00:04:03,496
Enough with the damn music!

90
00:04:06,633 --> 00:04:10,286
? And Mr. Nesbit says,
"Good night" ?

91
00:04:11,588 --> 00:04:14,790
? And the whole world says,
"Good night" ?

92
00:04:14,792 --> 00:04:16,342
Take it, Mommy.

93
00:04:19,629 --> 00:04:20,930
Got it-- load him up
with cough syrup,

94
00:04:20,932 --> 00:04:22,982
watch <i>Breaking Bad</i>
until he conks out.

95
00:04:22,984 --> 00:04:24,817
Just kidding.

96
00:04:27,070 --> 00:04:28,070
We did it.

97
00:04:28,072 --> 00:04:29,655
Yeah, we did.

98
00:04:29,657 --> 00:04:30,773
Now that we're out the door,

99
00:04:30,775 --> 00:04:32,641
I actually don't feel anxious.

100
00:04:33,645 --> 00:04:34,910
Whoa, oh, my God, it's your dad!

101
00:04:34,912 --> 00:04:37,813
Oh, something horrible
happened-- aah!

102
00:04:37,815 --> 00:04:40,082
Oh, it's Ted, relax.

103
00:04:40,084 --> 00:04:41,400
Bar, now.

104
00:04:42,369 --> 00:04:43,502
What is it?

105
00:04:43,504 --> 00:04:44,537
He needs me.

106
00:04:44,539 --> 00:04:45,788
But, baby, what about

107
00:04:45,790 --> 00:04:47,022
our magical romantic night?

108
00:04:47,023 --> 00:04:49,256
In four minutes we're supposed
to be doing hand stuff

109
00:04:49,258 --> 00:04:50,641
in the cab.

110
00:04:50,643 --> 00:04:52,693
I'll be quick--
I'm sure it's nothing huge.

111
00:04:52,695 --> 00:04:53,826
That's huge.

112
00:04:53,827 --> 00:04:56,494
And I knew that
I had to tell Robin.

113
00:04:56,496 --> 00:04:57,629
But?

114
00:04:57,631 --> 00:04:59,614
I may have, uh...

115
00:04:59,616 --> 00:05:01,782
asked her to be my date instead.

116
00:05:02,635 --> 00:05:03,801
What is wrong with me?

117
00:05:03,803 --> 00:05:04,802
Deep down,

118
00:05:04,804 --> 00:05:06,421
is there still
some crazy part of me

119
00:05:06,423 --> 00:05:08,089
that thinks I'm gonna
wind up with Robin?

120
00:05:08,091 --> 00:05:09,674
Am I that deluded?

121
00:05:09,676 --> 00:05:12,810
If so, I need to grow up.

122
00:05:12,812 --> 00:05:15,396
Oh, um, by the way,
I'm breaking a jinx swear here,

123
00:05:15,398 --> 00:05:17,465
so don't tell Barney
or he gets to whack me

124
00:05:17,467 --> 00:05:19,400
in the nuts three times
with a Wiffle ball bat.

125
00:05:19,402 --> 00:05:20,852
Sure, pretty standard.

126
00:05:20,854 --> 00:05:24,238
Robin deserves the chance to go
after Barney one last time

127
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,823
if that's what she wants.

128
00:05:26,089 --> 00:05:27,321
I'm gonna go tell her.

129
00:05:27,323 --> 00:05:29,007
One quick thing.
Yeah.

130
00:05:29,009 --> 00:05:30,041
Don't.

131
00:05:31,723 --> 00:05:34,941
Hey, um, I'm gonna be
a little while, baby.

132
00:05:34,943 --> 00:05:37,026
It's a long story,
but Ted needs my help.

133
00:05:37,028 --> 00:05:38,594
Okay, but hurry

134
00:05:38,596 --> 00:05:42,481
or I'm gonna start doing
number 11 on my own.

135
00:05:44,201 --> 00:05:45,785
You can do that by yourself?

136
00:05:45,787 --> 00:05:48,604
Pilates, bitch.

137
00:05:48,606 --> 00:05:50,523
Okay, why shouldn't
I tell Robin?

138
00:05:50,525 --> 00:05:52,909
Because deep down
some crazy part of you

139
00:05:52,911 --> 00:05:55,628
still thinks you're gonna
wind up with her, and I agree.

140
00:05:55,630 --> 00:05:58,414
Marshall...
I'm sorry, I'm Team Tedward.

141
00:05:58,416 --> 00:06:00,132
Always have been,
always will be.

142
00:06:00,134 --> 00:06:01,116
Now, listen.

143
00:06:01,118 --> 00:06:03,219
I want my best friend
to be happy.

144
00:06:03,221 --> 00:06:05,671
And if Robin could mean
happiness for you,

145
00:06:05,673 --> 00:06:08,591
then, dear God, why help her
go after another man?

146
00:06:08,593 --> 00:06:10,626
Because she might still be
in love with him.

147
00:06:10,628 --> 00:06:13,128
To not tell her,
to not give her that chance,

148
00:06:13,130 --> 00:06:14,480
it's... it's selfish.

149
00:06:14,482 --> 00:06:15,815
So be selfish.

150
00:06:15,817 --> 00:06:16,933
I can't do that.

151
00:06:16,935 --> 00:06:19,802
Tell that to the onion rings
we just "split."

152
00:06:19,804 --> 00:06:21,971
Robin is my friend.

153
00:06:21,973 --> 00:06:24,490
She's always been more
than that and you know it.

154
00:06:24,492 --> 00:06:25,641
Now, as we speak,

155
00:06:25,643 --> 00:06:28,861
my wife is in a hotel room
cheating on me...

156
00:06:28,863 --> 00:06:29,862
with herself.

157
00:06:29,864 --> 00:06:31,113
But I'm not
leaving here

158
00:06:31,115 --> 00:06:32,448
until you promise not to say

159
00:06:32,450 --> 00:06:33,916
a word about this to Robin.

160
00:06:34,534 --> 00:06:36,118
Now repeat after me. "I..."

161
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:39,822
Well, I can do more
at a time than "I."

162
00:06:39,824 --> 00:06:42,959
"I, Ted Mosby, promise to stop

163
00:06:42,961 --> 00:06:45,294
"putting everyone else's
interests ahead of my own,

164
00:06:45,296 --> 00:06:48,714
and for once in my life,
do what's best for me."

165
00:06:48,716 --> 00:06:51,384
I...

166
00:06:51,386 --> 00:06:54,303
Sorry, what was
the rest of that?

167
00:06:54,305 --> 00:06:56,605
Hey, Dad, just taking a break

168
00:06:56,607 --> 00:06:59,508
from our amazing night
to check in.

169
00:06:59,510 --> 00:07:04,063
I bet Marvin's pretty devastated
that I'm not there, huh?

170
00:07:04,065 --> 00:07:06,782
Not at all-- I don't think
he even noticed you're gone.

171
00:07:06,784 --> 00:07:08,851
It's kind of like Mommy who?

172
00:07:08,853 --> 00:07:10,786
Oh... oh, good.

173
00:07:10,788 --> 00:07:13,906
But I should probably sing him
his nighttime lullaby

174
00:07:13,908 --> 00:07:15,708
over the phone, just in case.

175
00:07:15,710 --> 00:07:17,827
Sang it already-- nailed it.

176
00:07:17,829 --> 00:07:19,195
Did you do the horsie?

177
00:07:19,197 --> 00:07:20,463
Yep.
The birdie?

178
00:07:20,465 --> 00:07:21,764
Yep.
Elephant?

179
00:07:21,766 --> 00:07:22,982
Yep.
Moose.

180
00:07:22,984 --> 00:07:24,500
No moose, trick question.

181
00:07:24,502 --> 00:07:25,801
Robot.

182
00:07:25,803 --> 00:07:26,886
Affirmative.

183
00:07:26,888 --> 00:07:28,054
Look, I should go.

184
00:07:28,056 --> 00:07:29,922
Marvin's asleep in my arms.

185
00:07:30,624 --> 00:07:32,258
Mmm, his head smells like love.

186
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:34,643
Bye.

187
00:07:38,891 --> 00:07:40,608
Whoa.

188
00:07:40,896 --> 00:07:45,883
Hello... and
hubba-hubba.

189
00:07:45,885 --> 00:07:46,935
Aw, thanks.

190
00:07:46,937 --> 00:07:49,687
But tonight is
about my main man Mosby.

191
00:07:49,689 --> 00:07:50,772
Really?
Why?

192
00:07:50,774 --> 00:07:51,856
Oh, Ted, tell Ranjit

193
00:07:51,858 --> 00:07:53,741
the huge thing
that's happening tonight.

194
00:07:54,944 --> 00:07:56,828
Barney's getting engaged.

195
00:07:58,447 --> 00:08:00,665
Ranjit out.

196
00:08:06,587 --> 00:08:08,568
Bar-Barney's getting engaged?

197
00:08:08,570 --> 00:08:09,986
He asked me to keep it a secret,

198
00:08:09,988 --> 00:08:12,989
but I thought
you deserved to know...

199
00:08:12,991 --> 00:08:16,776
in case you wanted
to do something about it.

200
00:08:16,778 --> 00:08:18,378
Do you?

201
00:08:19,697 --> 00:08:21,080
Do you, Robin?

202
00:08:21,082 --> 00:08:22,582
Ranjit, a little
privacy, please?

203
00:08:22,584 --> 00:08:26,502
Sorry, not listening.

204
00:08:35,045 --> 00:08:38,314
Nice, uneven floor
there, Ted.

205
00:08:38,316 --> 00:08:40,216
Lily, are you drunk?

206
00:08:40,218 --> 00:08:42,802
What? I...
I'm on vacation.

207
00:08:42,804 --> 00:08:45,405
I may have cracked open
the minibar to celebrate.

208
00:08:45,407 --> 00:08:47,190
Who invited the narc?

209
00:08:47,192 --> 00:08:48,808
Hey, listen,
I know that

210
00:08:48,810 --> 00:08:50,743
you miss Marvin, but it's not
like we could've brought him

211
00:08:50,745 --> 00:08:52,111
to a black tie event anyway.

212
00:08:54,643 --> 00:08:57,911
Yeah, these parents are
so lame and-and clingy.

213
00:08:57,913 --> 00:09:00,447
Yeah, it's like, cut the cord
already, right, guys?

214
00:09:00,449 --> 00:09:02,749
Yeah, yeah,
that baby's not even cute.

215
00:09:02,751 --> 00:09:04,034
Super ugly baby.

216
00:09:04,036 --> 00:09:06,086
It's almost
physically repulsive.

217
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:10,090
Aw....
Aw...

218
00:09:10,165 --> 00:09:12,800
Great, I just
started lactating.

219
00:09:12,802 --> 00:09:15,119
Me, too.

220
00:09:15,121 --> 00:09:17,922
So, what do you want to do?

221
00:09:20,726 --> 00:09:23,344
Robin, I do not
want to meddle,

222
00:09:23,346 --> 00:09:26,764
but this is like the classic
love song says...

223
00:09:32,070 --> 00:09:33,521
Ranjit.

224
00:09:33,523 --> 00:09:37,241
Ranjit, let's just communicate
via text from now on, okay?

225
00:09:40,663 --> 00:09:42,329
I appreciate
what you're doing.

226
00:09:42,331 --> 00:09:45,282
But I'm not chasing
after Barney anymore.

227
00:09:45,284 --> 00:09:48,452
I-I just got done being
crazy about all that.

228
00:09:48,454 --> 00:09:51,672
I mean, why would I want to
throw myself back in that pit?

229
00:09:51,674 --> 00:09:53,323
Because you're in love with him.

230
00:09:53,325 --> 00:09:55,342
No, I'm not.

231
00:09:55,344 --> 00:09:57,461
I'm happy for him.

232
00:09:57,463 --> 00:10:01,015
So, it doesn't bother you that
Barney Stinson's gonna propose

233
00:10:01,017 --> 00:10:04,334
to another woman on top of
the World Wide News building?

234
00:10:04,336 --> 00:10:06,336
Wait, why the top
of the World Wide News building?

235
00:10:06,338 --> 00:10:08,672
I guess it's Patrice's
favorite spot in the city.

236
00:10:08,674 --> 00:10:11,642
Damn it, Patrice, that's my
favorite spot in the city!

237
00:10:11,644 --> 00:10:15,479
Whoa.

238
00:10:15,481 --> 00:10:17,347
Ranjit says, "Whoa."

239
00:10:17,349 --> 00:10:19,233
Okay...

240
00:10:19,235 --> 00:10:23,687
maybe that one detail stings
a little bit,

241
00:10:23,689 --> 00:10:26,207
but that doesn't mean
I'm in love with Barney.

242
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:29,359
"Sounds like she's
in love with Barney."

243
00:10:29,361 --> 00:10:31,879
Okay, is this divider
even slightly soundproof?

244
00:10:33,332 --> 00:10:34,498
"Yes."

245
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:36,817
With a little
winky face.

246
00:10:36,819 --> 00:10:39,386
Look, I... I hope it goes
well for Barney.

247
00:10:39,388 --> 00:10:42,006
I really do.

248
00:10:42,008 --> 00:10:43,674
But tonight there is
no place I would rather be

249
00:10:43,676 --> 00:10:45,142
than at your building.

250
00:10:45,144 --> 00:10:46,977
Celebrating with you.

251
00:10:48,110 --> 00:10:51,713
This kid does not mean
that you're special.

252
00:10:51,813 --> 00:10:55,013
It just means that you're
horny and you're easy.

253
00:10:55,014 --> 00:10:56,681
Now, come on,
let me smell his head.

254
00:10:56,683 --> 00:11:00,518
Li-Lily, Lily,
no, no, no, no, come on.

255
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:04,088
Seriously, Ted,
what is up with the floor?

256
00:11:04,090 --> 00:11:05,973
Lily.
What?

257
00:11:05,975 --> 00:11:07,275
Is it harder
than we thought

258
00:11:07,277 --> 00:11:09,093
to be away from
Marvin? Yes.

259
00:11:09,095 --> 00:11:11,696
But are we gonna have fun
or are we gonna wallow

260
00:11:11,698 --> 00:11:13,097
in the corner like idiots?

261
00:11:13,099 --> 00:11:16,117
? Night, night, little Marvin

262
00:11:16,119 --> 00:11:19,654
? Stars twinkle for you

263
00:11:20,989 --> 00:11:24,575
? The Dreamland train's
a-chuggin' ?

264
00:11:24,577 --> 00:11:26,544
? All your dreams

265
00:11:26,546 --> 00:11:30,447
? Will come true.

266
00:11:30,449 --> 00:11:33,117
Hey.

267
00:11:33,119 --> 00:11:37,121
Do you realize that something
you thought up in your head

268
00:11:37,123 --> 00:11:41,292
now exists as a part
of the Manhattan skyline?

269
00:11:42,227 --> 00:11:43,644
That's huge.

270
00:11:43,646 --> 00:11:46,013
It's just a building.

271
00:11:46,015 --> 00:11:48,316
I mean, I'm incredibly young
for such an achievement,

272
00:11:48,318 --> 00:11:49,483
but it's just a building.

273
00:11:49,485 --> 00:11:50,985
I mean, <i>Architecture</i>
<i>Vision Weekly</i>

274
00:11:50,987 --> 00:11:53,521
may have dubbed it
"more than just a building,"

275
00:11:53,523 --> 00:11:54,939
but it's just a building.

276
00:11:54,941 --> 00:11:56,307
So let's not get carried...

277
00:11:56,309 --> 00:11:57,909
Okay, you're right, it's huge.

278
00:11:57,911 --> 00:11:59,160
It is huge.

279
00:11:59,162 --> 00:12:01,028
You're the star of the party,
and who knows?

280
00:12:01,030 --> 00:12:03,864
Maybe the future Mrs. Ted Mosby
is gonna be there.

281
00:12:07,002 --> 00:12:10,487
Yeah, maybe she will.

282
00:12:11,656 --> 00:12:13,507
Oh.

283
00:12:13,509 --> 00:12:15,226
Wait, this isn't your...

284
00:12:18,431 --> 00:12:20,664
This is
the World Wide News building.

285
00:12:21,499 --> 00:12:23,684
Go get him.

286
00:12:28,351 --> 00:12:31,442
I told you,
I am done chasing Barney.

287
00:12:31,797 --> 00:12:33,797
Now can we please go
to your party?

288
00:12:33,799 --> 00:12:36,683
Robin, do you want to spend
tonight making small talk

289
00:12:36,685 --> 00:12:38,417
with a bunch of bankers

290
00:12:38,419 --> 00:12:40,887
in a daring yet refined
contemporary masterpiece

291
00:12:40,889 --> 00:12:43,306
King Kong should feel lucky
to climb...

292
00:12:44,191 --> 00:12:45,809
...or do you
want to follow your heart?

293
00:12:45,811 --> 00:12:49,279
Why do you keep insisting that
I have feelings for Barney?

294
00:12:49,281 --> 00:12:51,448
Because you do.

295
00:12:51,450 --> 00:12:53,867
See, even Ranjit agrees.

296
00:12:53,869 --> 00:12:55,635
Oh, he's got to pee.

297
00:12:55,637 --> 00:12:58,404
The point is,

298
00:12:58,406 --> 00:12:59,706
you're not over Barney.

299
00:12:59,708 --> 00:13:01,274
That's why you freaked out
about him proposing

300
00:13:01,276 --> 00:13:03,109
on the roof
of the World Wide News building.

301
00:13:03,111 --> 00:13:05,078
I did not freak out.

302
00:13:05,796 --> 00:13:06,996
It's just...

303
00:13:06,998 --> 00:13:09,615
a teeny, tiny bit annoying

304
00:13:09,617 --> 00:13:11,584
that I am the one

305
00:13:11,586 --> 00:13:13,786
who showed her that roof
in the first place!

306
00:13:13,788 --> 00:13:14,954
Damn it, Patrice!

307
00:13:14,956 --> 00:13:16,789
Whoa.

308
00:13:18,176 --> 00:13:20,810
"Never mind; I found
a soda bottle."

309
00:13:20,812 --> 00:13:22,428
Okay, that's disturbing.

310
00:13:22,430 --> 00:13:24,314
What do you want me
to do, Ted?

311
00:13:24,316 --> 00:13:25,682
Run up to that roof,

312
00:13:25,684 --> 00:13:27,400
knock the ring
out of Barney's hand,

313
00:13:27,402 --> 00:13:30,854
and say, "Sorry to interrupt,
but you should be with me"?

314
00:13:30,856 --> 00:13:34,157
Is that what you want?

315
00:13:34,159 --> 00:13:36,075
No.

316
00:13:36,077 --> 00:13:38,194
I don't.

317
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:44,033
I can't keep making
an ass of myself.

318
00:13:45,035 --> 00:13:47,486
Well,

319
00:13:47,488 --> 00:13:50,373
a word in defense of making
an ass of yourself,

320
00:13:50,375 --> 00:13:51,824
it's underrated.

321
00:13:52,826 --> 00:13:54,427
Eight years ago

322
00:13:54,429 --> 00:13:57,330
I made an ass
of myself chasing after you,

323
00:13:57,332 --> 00:13:59,599
and I've made an ass
of myself chasing after you

324
00:13:59,601 --> 00:14:01,267
a bunch of times since then.

325
00:14:02,436 --> 00:14:04,003
But I have no regrets.

326
00:14:05,005 --> 00:14:06,606
Because it led me to something

327
00:14:06,608 --> 00:14:08,141
that I wouldn't trade
for the world.

328
00:14:08,143 --> 00:14:11,677
It led to you being my friend.

329
00:14:13,013 --> 00:14:15,064
So, as your friend

330
00:14:15,066 --> 00:14:17,617
and a leading expert
in the field

331
00:14:17,619 --> 00:14:19,352
of making an ass of yourself,

332
00:14:19,354 --> 00:14:21,070
I say to you

333
00:14:21,072 --> 00:14:24,457
from the heart,

334
00:14:24,459 --> 00:14:28,527
get the hell out of this car.

335
00:14:31,216 --> 00:14:34,634
But, Ted,

336
00:14:34,636 --> 00:14:38,004
your big night.

337
00:14:40,507 --> 00:14:43,092
It's just a building.

338
00:15:19,096 --> 00:15:21,464
<i>The Robin.</i>

339
00:15:23,550 --> 00:15:25,535
<i>Step one: admit to yourself</i>

340
00:15:25,537 --> 00:15:27,503
<i>that you still have feelings</i>
<i>for this girl.</i>

341
00:15:27,505 --> 00:15:31,307
I am hopelessly,
irretrievably in love with her.

342
00:15:32,042 --> 00:15:34,110
More than she knows.

343
00:15:34,112 --> 00:15:35,895
<i>Step two:</i>

344
00:15:35,897 --> 00:15:37,947
<i>choose the completely wrong</i>
<i>moment to make a drunken move</i>

345
00:15:37,949 --> 00:15:39,032
<i>after hanging out</i>

346
00:15:39,034 --> 00:15:42,235
<i>at a strip club</i>

347
00:15:42,237 --> 00:15:44,621
<i>and get shot down on purpose.</i>

348
00:15:46,407 --> 00:15:48,324
<i>Step three:</i>

349
00:15:48,326 --> 00:15:51,044
<i>agree that you two don't work,</i>
<i>locking the door</i>

350
00:15:51,046 --> 00:15:52,779
<i>on any future</i>
<i>you could have together.</i>

351
00:15:52,781 --> 00:15:54,580
I'm done trying to get you.

352
00:15:55,399 --> 00:15:56,916
I can't do it anymore.

353
00:15:56,918 --> 00:15:58,617
<i>Which will drive Robin nuts.</i>

354
00:15:58,619 --> 00:15:59,869
Huh.

355
00:15:59,871 --> 00:16:02,889
<i>Step four:</i>

356
00:16:02,891 --> 00:16:05,091
<i>Robin goes nuts.</i>

357
00:16:05,809 --> 00:16:06,943
<i>Step five:</i>

358
00:16:06,945 --> 00:16:09,128
<i>find the person</i>
<i>who annoys Robin most</i>

359
00:16:09,130 --> 00:16:10,096
<i>in the world...</i>

360
00:16:10,098 --> 00:16:13,349
Nobody asked
for your help, Patrice!

361
00:16:13,351 --> 00:16:16,619
<i>...and ask for her help.</i>

362
00:16:16,621 --> 00:16:18,938
Oh, hi, Barney.

363
00:16:18,940 --> 00:16:20,073
What are you doing here?

364
00:16:20,075 --> 00:16:21,691
Actually, I'm looking for you.

365
00:16:21,693 --> 00:16:23,993
This may sound kind of weird,
but I have a proposition...

366
00:16:23,995 --> 00:16:26,162
<i>Explain everything to Patrice</i>

367
00:16:26,164 --> 00:16:28,031
<i>and hope she agrees to help.</i>

368
00:16:28,033 --> 00:16:29,815
Yay. I love Robin.

369
00:16:29,817 --> 00:16:31,951
Of course I'll help.

370
00:16:31,953 --> 00:16:33,503
Good, good.

371
00:16:33,505 --> 00:16:35,705
<i>Step six:</i>
<i>check with your doctor</i>

372
00:16:35,707 --> 00:16:37,823
<i>about possible broken ribs.</i>

373
00:16:37,825 --> 00:16:40,626
<i>Step seven:</i>
<i>pretend to be dating Patrice.</i>

374
00:16:40,628 --> 00:16:43,963
Nobody asked you here,
Patrice!

375
00:16:45,099 --> 00:16:46,766
Actually, I did.

376
00:16:46,768 --> 00:16:48,051
<i>Step eight:</i>

377
00:16:48,053 --> 00:16:50,353
<i>wait until Robin inevitably</i>
<i>breaks into your place</i>

378
00:16:50,355 --> 00:16:52,355
<i>to find the Playbook</i>
<i>and show it to Patrice,</i>

379
00:16:52,357 --> 00:16:54,640
<i>which you'll monitor</i>
<i>via the hidden cameras</i>

380
00:16:54,642 --> 00:16:57,343
<i>you have in your apartment.</i>

381
00:16:59,179 --> 00:17:03,015
Patrice, the robin's
in the nest.

382
00:17:03,017 --> 00:17:06,619
That means Robin broke
into my apartment

383
00:17:06,621 --> 00:17:08,454
Were you even listening
when I explained the codes?

384
00:17:08,456 --> 00:17:10,406
<i>Step nine: after Patrice</i>
<i>finds the Playbook,</i>

385
00:17:10,408 --> 00:17:13,543
<i>have your first big fight.</i>

386
00:17:13,545 --> 00:17:15,128
This is going so well.

387
00:17:15,130 --> 00:17:16,362
Thank you so much.

388
00:17:16,364 --> 00:17:19,031
I know, but what the heck
are Lily and Ted doing here?

389
00:17:19,033 --> 00:17:21,050
I don't know.
My friends have no boundaries.

390
00:17:21,052 --> 00:17:23,002
How can I ever thank you?

391
00:17:23,004 --> 00:17:24,887
Will you watch my
cat next weekend?

392
00:17:24,889 --> 00:17:26,422
No.

393
00:17:26,424 --> 00:17:29,058
Come on, we should probably
go back inside.

394
00:17:29,060 --> 00:17:30,727
<i>Step ten:</i>

395
00:17:30,729 --> 00:17:32,228
<i>prove your loyalty to Patrice</i>

396
00:17:32,230 --> 00:17:33,879
<i>by burning the Playbook,</i>

397
00:17:33,881 --> 00:17:35,765
<i>and actually burn it.</i>

398
00:17:37,518 --> 00:17:40,103
<i>You don't need it anymore.</i>

399
00:17:41,438 --> 00:17:42,721
<i>Step 11:</i>

400
00:17:42,723 --> 00:17:44,323
<i>because your friends</i>
<i>have no boundaries,</i>

401
00:17:44,325 --> 00:17:45,825
<i>they'll inevitably have</i>

402
00:17:45,827 --> 00:17:47,276
<i>an intervention for Robin,</i>

403
00:17:47,278 --> 00:17:49,228
<i>which you'll monitor</i>
<i>via the hidden cameras</i>

404
00:17:49,230 --> 00:17:50,830
<i>you have in Marshall</i>
<i>and Lily's apartment.</i>

405
00:17:50,832 --> 00:17:52,532
<i>Step 12:</i>

406
00:17:52,534 --> 00:17:53,833
<i>tell only Ted about your plan</i>

407
00:17:53,835 --> 00:17:55,401
<i>to propose to Patrice.</i>

408
00:17:55,403 --> 00:17:57,420
You can't tell anybody.

409
00:17:57,422 --> 00:17:59,172
Agreed?

410
00:18:00,924 --> 00:18:02,408
<i>Step 13:</i>

411
00:18:02,410 --> 00:18:04,093
<i>wait and see</i>
<i>if Ted tells Robin,</i>

412
00:18:04,095 --> 00:18:05,745
<i>and if he does...</i>

413
00:18:05,747 --> 00:18:07,346
Barney's getting engaged.

414
00:18:07,348 --> 00:18:09,132
<i>...it means your best bro</i>
<i>in the world</i>

415
00:18:09,134 --> 00:18:12,301
<i>has let go of Robin</i>
<i>and has given you his blessing.</i>

416
00:18:12,303 --> 00:18:15,388
<i>Step 14:</i>
<i>Robin arrives</i>

417
00:18:15,390 --> 00:18:17,190
<i>at her favorite spot</i>
<i>in the city</i>

418
00:18:17,192 --> 00:18:18,558
<i>and finds the secret final page</i>

419
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:21,360
<i>of the Playbook.</i>

420
00:18:21,362 --> 00:18:22,979
<i>The last play</i>

421
00:18:22,981 --> 00:18:24,763
<i>you'll ever run.</i>

422
00:18:24,765 --> 00:18:27,200
<i>Step 15: Robin realizes</i>

423
00:18:27,202 --> 00:18:29,819
<i>she's standing</i>
<i>underneath mistletoe.</i>

424
00:18:39,747 --> 00:18:40,946
Seriously, Barney?

425
00:18:40,948 --> 00:18:43,166
Even you,

426
00:18:43,168 --> 00:18:46,752
even someone
as certifiably insane as you

427
00:18:46,754 --> 00:18:49,172
must realize
that this is too far.

428
00:18:50,324 --> 00:18:51,891
You lied to me,

429
00:18:51,893 --> 00:18:53,676
manipulated me for weeks.

430
00:18:53,678 --> 00:18:56,128
Do you really think I could
ever kiss you after that?

431
00:18:56,130 --> 00:18:57,296
Do you really think

432
00:18:57,298 --> 00:18:59,899
I could ever trust you
after that?

433
00:18:59,901 --> 00:19:00,850
This...

434
00:19:00,852 --> 00:19:02,435
this is proof

435
00:19:02,437 --> 00:19:03,603
of why we don't work,

436
00:19:03,605 --> 00:19:05,104
why we'll never work.

437
00:19:06,056 --> 00:19:07,523
So thank you.

438
00:19:07,525 --> 00:19:09,642
You've set me free because...

439
00:19:09,644 --> 00:19:12,811
how could I be with a man
who thinks that this...

440
00:19:12,813 --> 00:19:15,414
trick, this enormous lie

441
00:19:15,416 --> 00:19:17,917
could ever make me want
to date him again?

442
00:19:18,702 --> 00:19:20,803
Turn it over.

443
00:19:29,630 --> 00:19:31,330
Robin Scherbatsky...

444
00:19:32,299 --> 00:19:34,500
...will you marry me?

445
00:19:40,207 --> 00:19:42,408
Yes.

446
00:19:43,010 --> 00:19:46,729
? In the oceans deep

447
00:19:46,731 --> 00:19:50,449
? In the canyons steep

448
00:19:50,451 --> 00:19:52,818
? Walls of granite

449
00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:56,522
? Here I stand

450
00:19:56,524 --> 00:20:01,043
? All my desperate calls

451
00:20:01,045 --> 00:20:04,497
? Echo off the walls

452
00:20:04,499 --> 00:20:06,632
? Back and forth...

453
00:20:06,634 --> 00:20:09,218
And so, let's all raise a glass
to Ted Mosby.

454
00:20:09,220 --> 00:20:10,670
None of this

455
00:20:10,672 --> 00:20:12,805
would have been possible
without him.

456
00:20:12,807 --> 00:20:13,923
To Ted.

457
00:20:13,925 --> 00:20:15,558
To Ted.

458
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:18,978
? Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

459
00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:23,048
? Oh-oh-oh-
oh-oh ?

460
00:20:23,050 --> 00:20:25,768
? Oh-oh

461
00:20:25,770 --> 00:20:29,021
? To believe

462
00:20:29,023 --> 00:20:31,857
? I walk

463
00:20:31,859 --> 00:20:36,028
? Alone

464
00:20:40,367 --> 00:20:42,735
? Is a lie

465
00:20:42,737 --> 00:20:47,123
? That I've ?

466
00:20:47,125 --> 00:20:49,709
? Been told

467
00:20:49,711 --> 00:20:54,797
? So let your heart hold fast

468
00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:58,467
? For this soon shall pass

469
00:20:58,469 --> 00:21:03,626
? There's another hill ahead. ?
