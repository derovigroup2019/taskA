1
00:00:00,992 --> 00:00:03,228
Kids,
Barney's mom had this blouse

2
00:00:03,229 --> 00:00:05,363
<i>that she absolutely loved,</i>

3
00:00:05,365 --> 00:00:07,031
<i>but then Robin won it</i>
<i>in a poker game,</i>

4
00:00:07,033 --> 00:00:09,200
<i>which led</i>
<i>to some slight awkwardness.</i>

5
00:00:09,202 --> 00:00:13,070
You won the battle...
but I'll win the war.

6
00:00:13,072 --> 00:00:14,906
Game on, bitch.

7
00:00:14,908 --> 00:00:18,459
<i>Please, Mom,</i>
<i>I need you to just be cool.</i>

8
00:00:18,461 --> 00:00:20,011
Okay, can you do that for me?

9
00:00:20,013 --> 00:00:21,078
For you, yes.

10
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:22,579
And for Robin?

11
00:00:22,581 --> 00:00:23,965
She's gonna be

12
00:00:23,967 --> 00:00:25,916
your daughter in 33 hours.

13
00:00:25,918 --> 00:00:26,884
Daughter in <i>law.</i>

14
00:00:26,886 --> 00:00:28,135
Making it illegal

15
00:00:28,137 --> 00:00:30,137
for you not
to treat her like a daughter.

16
00:00:30,139 --> 00:00:31,856
In-lawyered.

17
00:00:32,474 --> 00:00:33,757
Please, Mom.

18
00:00:33,759 --> 00:00:36,527
All Robin wants to do is
put this whole thing behind her

19
00:00:36,529 --> 00:00:39,397
so she can get married and
put this whole thing behind her.

20
00:00:39,399 --> 00:00:41,282
Ah! Get-this-over-with-quickly
so-we-can

21
00:00:41,284 --> 00:00:44,201
move-past-how-awkward-it-was
that-I-just-said-that five!

22
00:00:44,203 --> 00:00:46,370
Fine. If Robin's ready
to bury the hatchet,

23
00:00:46,372 --> 00:00:49,040
then I guess
I'm ready to bury the hatchet.

24
00:00:49,042 --> 00:00:51,742
Morning, bitches.
Like my new blouse?

25
00:00:51,744 --> 00:00:53,744
Oh, hell, <i>no!</i>
No, Mom. Mom!

26
00:00:53,746 --> 00:00:54,996
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

00:01:07,643 --> 00:01:09,960
<i>Kids, not far</i>
<i>from the Farhampton Inn,</i>

30
00:01:09,962 --> 00:01:10,978
<i>there's a lighthouse.</i>

31
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:12,796
<i>It's a really special place,</i>

32
00:01:12,798 --> 00:01:15,433
<i>and that morning</i>
<i>I wanted to see it for myself.</i>

33
00:01:15,435 --> 00:01:16,684
<i>There was just one problem.</i>

34
00:01:16,686 --> 00:01:18,969
Look, I'm sorry, Ted, but-but

35
00:01:18,971 --> 00:01:21,638
I can't in good faith send
a lonely guy like yourself

36
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:23,824
to the top
of a very romantic,

37
00:01:23,826 --> 00:01:26,744
and more to the point,
a very tall lighthouse.

38
00:01:28,647 --> 00:01:31,115
I don't want your blood
on my hands,

39
00:01:31,117 --> 00:01:34,118
and I mean that literally,
because it would be my job to...

40
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:36,170
to hose down the rocks.

41
00:01:36,172 --> 00:01:38,506
<i>Now, late the night before,</i>

42
00:01:38,508 --> 00:01:41,258
<i>thanks to Marshall's</i>
<i>travel companion, Daphne,</i>

43
00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:44,011
<i>Lily had received</i>
<i>some unsettling news.</i>

44
00:01:44,013 --> 00:01:45,579
I'm gonna be a judge.

45
00:01:45,581 --> 00:01:47,882
<i>Screwing up their</i>
<i>whole plan to move to Italy.</i>

46
00:01:47,884 --> 00:01:49,166
<i>She wasn't happy.</i>

47
00:01:49,168 --> 00:01:50,801
Yes, I'm in a rotten mood.

48
00:01:50,803 --> 00:01:52,219
No, I don't want
to talk about it.

49
00:01:52,221 --> 00:01:53,788
Yes, this has
booze in it.

50
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:55,272
No, it's not
my first.

51
00:01:55,274 --> 00:01:57,641
You want to make this brunch
a drunch?

52
00:01:57,643 --> 00:01:59,810
You do you, I'm not gonna judge.

53
00:02:01,279 --> 00:02:02,346
I'm gonna be a judge.

54
00:02:02,348 --> 00:02:04,065
Judge.

55
00:02:05,734 --> 00:02:08,536
Thank you, Linus.

56
00:02:08,538 --> 00:02:09,954
<i>As for Marshall and Daphne,</i>

57
00:02:09,956 --> 00:02:11,522
<i>they got caught</i>
<i>in that big storm.</i>

58
00:02:11,524 --> 00:02:13,874
<i>Luckily, they had a place</i>
<i>to crash for the night.</i>

59
00:02:13,876 --> 00:02:15,826
<i>My childhood home.</i>

60
00:02:15,828 --> 00:02:19,246
<i>Okay, that sign</i>
<i>might not have been there.</i>

61
00:02:19,248 --> 00:02:21,832
Thank you so much for letting
us stay the night, Mrs. Mosby.

62
00:02:21,834 --> 00:02:22,967
Oh, it's our pleasure.

63
00:02:22,969 --> 00:02:25,002
I'm just glad that storm has passed.
Oh.

64
00:02:25,004 --> 00:02:27,355
But there's one storm
that hasn't passed,

65
00:02:27,357 --> 00:02:29,373
isn't there, Marshall?

66
00:02:29,375 --> 00:02:31,058
Hey, Clint.

67
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:33,043
You know what I'm talking
about, don't you, Marshall?

68
00:02:33,045 --> 00:02:34,395
I'm talking about the one
that's been raining

69
00:02:34,397 --> 00:02:37,982
cats and dogs all over
this-this, this friendship.

70
00:02:37,984 --> 00:02:39,266
This isn't a friendship.

71
00:02:39,268 --> 00:02:40,768
Oh.

72
00:02:40,770 --> 00:02:42,719
Nice.

73
00:02:42,721 --> 00:02:45,489
We're reluctant
travel companions.

74
00:02:45,491 --> 00:02:46,857
Well, little known fact
about me.

75
00:02:46,859 --> 00:02:48,109
I'm an almost-graduate

76
00:02:48,111 --> 00:02:51,195
of the Conflict Resolution
program over at... at Tri-C.

77
00:02:51,197 --> 00:02:54,281
I even had my own practice
at Van Aken Plaza

78
00:02:54,283 --> 00:02:55,566
before the manager
of the Wendy's

79
00:02:55,568 --> 00:02:57,468
made me stop hogging the booth.

80
00:02:57,470 --> 00:03:00,121
The point is,
I can fix this.

81
00:03:00,123 --> 00:03:01,705
Oh, I don't know, Clint.

82
00:03:03,042 --> 00:03:05,126
? Gonna resolve some conflicts

83
00:03:05,128 --> 00:03:06,627
? Gonna resolve
some conflicts ?

84
00:03:06,629 --> 00:03:09,246
? Gonna make
a deeper understanding ?

85
00:03:09,248 --> 00:03:10,798
? Through mediation.

86
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,767
Okay, you know what?
We have to hit the road.

87
00:03:12,769 --> 00:03:16,253
But, um, Mrs. Mosby, do you
mind if I take this mug?

88
00:03:16,255 --> 00:03:17,938
I would very much like

89
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:20,057
to make fun of Ted
next time I see him.

90
00:03:20,059 --> 00:03:21,258
Of course.

91
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:22,810
You know, when Ted was seven,

92
00:03:22,812 --> 00:03:25,563
he and his best friend
took this Wild West photo

93
00:03:25,565 --> 00:03:26,864
together at Geauga Lake.

94
00:03:26,866 --> 00:03:28,382
I could go look for it.

95
00:03:28,384 --> 00:03:29,733
We really should get going.

96
00:03:29,735 --> 00:03:30,935
His best friend was a balloon.

97
00:03:30,936 --> 00:03:32,069
What's a few more minutes?

98
00:03:32,071 --> 00:03:34,104
Yeah, you're gonna want that.

99
00:03:34,106 --> 00:03:36,574
So... what's everyone
doing this morning?

100
00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:39,109
Oh, well, I kind of feel
like playing some tennis.

101
00:03:39,111 --> 00:03:40,578
Maybe we should reserve a court.

102
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:42,046
Court.

103
00:03:44,416 --> 00:03:46,734
Thank you, Linus.

104
00:03:46,736 --> 00:03:48,752
Pancakes and eggs, Robin?

105
00:03:48,754 --> 00:03:51,955
I guess that blouse won't be
loose and flowy for long.

106
00:03:51,957 --> 00:03:52,789
Mom...

107
00:03:52,791 --> 00:03:53,891
Keep talking, Loretta.

108
00:03:53,893 --> 00:03:56,177
I've been waiting
all morning to...

109
00:03:56,179 --> 00:03:57,961
ketchup.

110
00:03:57,963 --> 00:03:59,396
Oops.

111
00:03:59,398 --> 00:04:03,150
You're not supposed to put
ketchup on scrambled eggs.

112
00:04:03,152 --> 00:04:04,935
Right, Loretta, because

113
00:04:04,937 --> 00:04:07,471
you're the queen
of scrambled eggs.

114
00:04:07,473 --> 00:04:08,305
Actually, that's

115
00:04:08,307 --> 00:04:09,773
exactly what she is.

116
00:04:09,775 --> 00:04:10,941
When Mom was

117
00:04:10,943 --> 00:04:12,309
a groupie in the '70s,

118
00:04:12,311 --> 00:04:15,746
her scrambled eggs made her the
darling of the MSG loading dock.

119
00:04:15,748 --> 00:04:18,199
Lot of songs written
about those scrambled eggs.

120
00:04:18,201 --> 00:04:19,983
ZZ Top's "She's Got Legs"?

121
00:04:19,985 --> 00:04:21,702
Originally "She's Got Eggs."

122
00:04:21,704 --> 00:04:22,586
Led Zeppelin?

123
00:04:22,588 --> 00:04:23,921
"Scramble On."

124
00:04:23,923 --> 00:04:25,206
Steve Miller?

125
00:04:25,208 --> 00:04:26,624
"The Yolker."

126
00:04:26,626 --> 00:04:28,843
If you listen to Pink Floyd's
<i>Dark Side of the Moon</i>

127
00:04:28,845 --> 00:04:31,962
while eating her eggs,
it lines up perfectly.

128
00:04:31,964 --> 00:04:35,432
While I'm sure it was
your mother's cooking skills

129
00:04:35,434 --> 00:04:39,103
that made her so popular with
Zed Zed Top and their ilk,

130
00:04:39,105 --> 00:04:40,688
I know for a fact

131
00:04:40,690 --> 00:04:43,357
that she does not make
the best scrambled eggs.

132
00:04:43,359 --> 00:04:46,694
Because my mom makes
the best scrambled eggs.

133
00:04:48,364 --> 00:04:50,347
<i>Kids, we've known</i>
<i>your Aunt Robin</i>

134
00:04:50,349 --> 00:04:52,116
<i>for eight years at that point,</i>

135
00:04:52,118 --> 00:04:54,285
<i>and here's what we knew</i>
<i>about her mom.</i>

136
00:04:54,287 --> 00:04:55,452
My mom is terrified
of flying.

137
00:04:57,073 --> 00:04:59,073
My mom got stung
by a jellyfish.

138
00:05:00,409 --> 00:05:01,909
My mom makes
the best scrambled eggs.

139
00:05:03,045 --> 00:05:05,229
<i>And... that's everything.</i>

140
00:05:05,231 --> 00:05:07,464
In fact, she should be here
any minute.

141
00:05:07,466 --> 00:05:08,632
Barney,

142
00:05:08,634 --> 00:05:10,534
maybe she can cook you
some real scrambled eggs

143
00:05:10,536 --> 00:05:12,369
so you can see what
you've been missing.

144
00:05:12,371 --> 00:05:14,555
Don't do this, Robin.
You can't win the egg war.

145
00:05:14,557 --> 00:05:16,390
Canadian scrambled eggs,
how quaint.

146
00:05:16,392 --> 00:05:18,542
Does your mom put maple syrup
on them?

147
00:05:18,544 --> 00:05:20,544
Ha, ha, ha,
this is all very friendly.

148
00:05:20,546 --> 00:05:21,878
Get out of this now.

149
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:24,648
Why not? We put maple syrup
on everything else.

150
00:05:26,318 --> 00:05:27,401
Aw.

151
00:05:27,403 --> 00:05:29,770
That's it!

152
00:05:29,772 --> 00:05:32,022
We need your omelet station.

153
00:05:32,024 --> 00:05:35,526
My son's fianc?e is
about to get served...

154
00:05:35,528 --> 00:05:37,745
some delicious
scrambled eggs.

155
00:05:37,747 --> 00:05:41,031
Or I could go out to the
driveway and eat some gravel.

156
00:05:42,168 --> 00:05:44,535
Wait. Sorry.
Did you say gravel or gavel?

157
00:05:44,537 --> 00:05:45,869
Gravel. Why would
I say gavel?

158
00:05:45,871 --> 00:05:47,204
Gavel.

159
00:05:51,127 --> 00:05:52,259
Thank you, Linus.

160
00:05:52,261 --> 00:05:54,128
Curtis, can I please

161
00:05:54,130 --> 00:05:56,297
have a map to the lighthouse?

162
00:05:56,299 --> 00:05:58,215
It's a very romantic lighthouse.

163
00:05:58,217 --> 00:05:59,416
I can't even have a map?

164
00:05:59,418 --> 00:06:01,552
It's a very romantic map.

165
00:06:01,554 --> 00:06:03,387
I can't let you go
without a date.

166
00:06:03,389 --> 00:06:04,805
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

167
00:06:04,807 --> 00:06:07,308
What happened to that girl Cassie?
Cassie?

168
00:06:07,310 --> 00:06:09,059
<i>Cassie was the girl I'd spent</i>

169
00:06:09,061 --> 00:06:10,927
<i>the entire previous night</i>
<i>consoling.</i>

170
00:06:10,929 --> 00:06:14,148
<i>Just consoling.</i>

171
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:15,065
Yeah, that's not happening.

172
00:06:15,067 --> 00:06:17,117
<i>And then, in her anger,</i>

173
00:06:17,119 --> 00:06:18,935
<i>Lily gave me a piece of advice</i>

174
00:06:18,937 --> 00:06:20,454
<i>about which</i>
<i>she would later say...</i>

175
00:06:20,456 --> 00:06:23,657
Oh, mama, that was
some bad advice.

176
00:06:23,659 --> 00:06:25,459
Okay, here's why
you're an idiot.

177
00:06:25,461 --> 00:06:27,661
Did you find
Cassie attractive?

178
00:06:27,663 --> 00:06:30,947
I guess.
Is she a relatively normal height?

179
00:06:30,949 --> 00:06:33,950
Yeah.
So end up with her already.

180
00:06:33,952 --> 00:06:35,919
God, do you really think

181
00:06:35,921 --> 00:06:37,954
that you're gonna find
some perfect girl

182
00:06:37,956 --> 00:06:41,225
who checks off every
item on your list?

183
00:06:41,227 --> 00:06:42,643
Well, not every item.

184
00:06:42,645 --> 00:06:45,012
I mean, she doesn't have
to share my love for coins.

185
00:06:45,014 --> 00:06:47,398
Although it would
be nice, just once,

186
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:50,801
not to have to go stag
to Coin-Con.

187
00:06:50,803 --> 00:06:53,237
Pull your head out
of your ass, Mosby.

188
00:06:53,239 --> 00:06:56,139
Do you think Marshall
always makes me happy?

189
00:06:56,141 --> 00:06:59,410
I mean, sometimes being
with him is a real trial.

190
00:06:59,412 --> 00:07:01,445
Real trial.

191
00:07:01,447 --> 00:07:02,463
Huh.

192
00:07:02,465 --> 00:07:04,248
Did it to myself that time.

193
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:07,818
Look, Ted, it's
time to settle.

194
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:09,953
Take this normal-sized chick
up to the lighthouse

195
00:07:09,955 --> 00:07:11,338
and fall in love with her

196
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:15,042
and quit bothering us with
your dumb love life stuff.

197
00:07:15,044 --> 00:07:18,328
God, I am so sick of being
smarter than everyone else.

198
00:07:19,798 --> 00:07:20,798
You're slipping, Linus.

199
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:23,300
We're running
out of glasses.

200
00:07:29,307 --> 00:07:32,059
Do you want to just go
to the stupid lighthouse?

201
00:07:32,061 --> 00:07:34,111
Ooh, zitch dog.

202
00:07:34,113 --> 00:07:35,729
Cocker spaniel in the Jetta.

203
00:07:35,731 --> 00:07:37,948
That's Marshall
Eriksen-- 28,

204
00:07:37,950 --> 00:07:39,015
Daphne-- zero.

205
00:07:39,017 --> 00:07:40,818
For the 28th time,

206
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:43,037
I'm not playing
your stupid game!

207
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:44,455
Oh, stupid, huh?

208
00:07:44,457 --> 00:07:45,522
That's great.

209
00:07:45,524 --> 00:07:47,541
I guess Daphne gets
to pick the music

210
00:07:47,543 --> 00:07:50,026
and crap all over
my fun road-trip games.

211
00:07:50,028 --> 00:07:52,296
You know, maybe
Clint was right.

212
00:07:52,298 --> 00:07:54,465
Maybe we do need
conflict resolution.

213
00:07:54,467 --> 00:07:55,666
I knew you guys
would come around.

214
00:07:59,274 --> 00:08:01,942
<i>And so I made up my mind</i>
<i>to settle for Cassie.</i>

215
00:08:02,164 --> 00:08:04,998
So, um, what kind
of music do you like?

216
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,867
Hmm... nothing.

217
00:08:09,971 --> 00:08:11,722
<i>Still, I felt optimistic.</i>

218
00:08:11,724 --> 00:08:13,807
<i>After all,</i>
<i>Cassie was cute and single</i>

219
00:08:13,809 --> 00:08:16,310
<i>and heck, it's not like</i>
<i>the universe was telling us</i>

220
00:08:16,312 --> 00:08:17,711
<i>we shouldn't be together.</i>

221
00:08:22,767 --> 00:08:25,319
Here we are. Enjoy.

222
00:08:25,321 --> 00:08:26,720
happy wife,
happy life.

223
00:08:26,722 --> 00:08:28,021
Pretend
they're just okay.

224
00:08:28,023 --> 00:08:31,274
Please, Lily,
I think I can manage to...

225
00:08:32,193 --> 00:08:34,161
Oh, my God.

226
00:08:34,163 --> 00:08:35,362
I'm eight years
old again,

227
00:08:35,364 --> 00:08:36,713
and life is perfect,

228
00:08:36,715 --> 00:08:39,149
and I haven't peed my shorts
in front of 350 Webelos

229
00:08:39,151 --> 00:08:41,885
at the Pinewood Derby Regionals
in Wheeling, West Virginia.

230
00:08:41,887 --> 00:08:43,053
I'm sorry, Robin.

231
00:08:43,055 --> 00:08:44,388
What do you think, Lily?

232
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:47,040
Oh, my God,
they are so delicious.

233
00:08:47,042 --> 00:08:49,409
Even more delicious than
finding out Barney peed himself

234
00:08:49,411 --> 00:08:52,295
at the Pinewood Derby Regionals
in Wheeling, West Virginia.

235
00:08:52,297 --> 00:08:53,847
I'm sorry, Robin.

236
00:08:53,849 --> 00:08:54,765
Mmm.
Come on,

237
00:08:54,767 --> 00:08:55,849
they can't be
that good.

238
00:08:55,851 --> 00:08:57,634
Oh!

239
00:08:57,636 --> 00:08:59,553
Excuse me, Mrs. Stinson,
some of our guests

240
00:08:59,555 --> 00:09:01,254
smelled your scrambled eggs
and were wondering

241
00:09:01,256 --> 00:09:03,523
if you could make some
for them as well.

242
00:09:03,525 --> 00:09:05,091
Oh, I don't think I should...

243
00:09:05,093 --> 00:09:08,362
Eggs! Eggs! Eggs!
Eggs! Eggs! Eggs!

244
00:09:08,364 --> 00:09:09,813
Eggs! Eggs!

245
00:09:09,815 --> 00:09:11,281
Clint, what are
you doing here?

246
00:09:11,283 --> 00:09:14,067
What the Ohio State Board of
Holistic Medicine has repeatedly

247
00:09:14,069 --> 00:09:17,287
told me I'm in no way qualified
to do: my job.

248
00:09:17,289 --> 00:09:20,440
When I see a conflict
needs resolving, I must act.

249
00:09:20,442 --> 00:09:22,376
Plus, Ted's mom wanted me out
of the house.

250
00:09:22,378 --> 00:09:24,711
So, today, we're gonna build
a new paradigm

251
00:09:24,713 --> 00:09:26,246
of understanding,

252
00:09:26,248 --> 00:09:29,049
and then you're gonna swoop me
on back to Shaker Heights.

253
00:09:29,051 --> 00:09:30,083
Oh, I need to stop

254
00:09:30,085 --> 00:09:31,551
at Record Rev on Coventry.

255
00:09:31,553 --> 00:09:32,836
My vaporizer's ready.

256
00:09:32,838 --> 00:09:34,504
Marshall, pull over
and dump this hippie

257
00:09:34,506 --> 00:09:35,922
on the side of the road.

258
00:09:35,924 --> 00:09:37,123
I can't do that.

259
00:09:37,125 --> 00:09:38,892
? Gonna resolve
some conflicts ?

260
00:09:38,894 --> 00:09:40,560
? Gonna resolve some conflicts

261
00:09:40,562 --> 00:09:41,961
Daphne picks the music.

262
00:09:41,963 --> 00:09:43,296
? Gonna end this argument

263
00:09:43,298 --> 00:09:45,015
? Between Marshall
and his mistress. ?

264
00:09:45,017 --> 00:09:46,900
Oh, come on.
Daphne picks the music!

265
00:09:46,902 --> 00:09:49,736
Ow! Stupid racecar!

266
00:09:49,738 --> 00:09:51,905
This is why children
should not have toys!

267
00:09:51,907 --> 00:09:53,907
Look, maybe this lighthouse
thing isn't such a good idea.

268
00:09:53,909 --> 00:09:55,075
No, you don't.

269
00:09:55,576 --> 00:09:56,810
You committed,

270
00:09:56,812 --> 00:09:58,945
and so did I, so let's go.

271
00:09:59,864 --> 00:10:01,915
Oh. Ow! Oh!

272
00:10:01,917 --> 00:10:03,784
Actually, it's feeling better.

273
00:10:03,786 --> 00:10:05,285
Ow! Oh! No, it's not.

274
00:10:05,287 --> 00:10:07,287
Oh.

275
00:10:07,289 --> 00:10:09,089
Mom, I don't know
why your phone is off.

276
00:10:09,091 --> 00:10:11,291
Maybe you left your charger
in the pickup truck.

277
00:10:12,544 --> 00:10:14,344
But I need you to get here
as fast  possible.

278
00:10:14,346 --> 00:10:15,429
I know
you're probably gonna want

279
00:10:15,431 --> 00:10:16,830
to take a hot bath
when you get in.

280
00:10:17,549 --> 00:10:18,765
She fits in a bathtub.

281
00:10:18,767 --> 00:10:20,684
That's good news. Unless...

282
00:10:20,686 --> 00:10:22,702
Oh, God, how big are
Canadian bathtubs?

283
00:10:22,704 --> 00:10:24,855
People ever line up

284
00:10:24,857 --> 00:10:26,106
like this for your mom's eggs?

285
00:10:26,108 --> 00:10:30,193
Loretta, even <i>I</i> could make
better eggs than this.

286
00:10:30,195 --> 00:10:31,945
Oh, I'd love it
if you'd come teach me

287
00:10:31,947 --> 00:10:33,146
how to make scrambled eggs.

288
00:10:33,148 --> 00:10:34,948
It's a scramble-off,
everybody!

289
00:10:34,950 --> 00:10:37,033
A scramble-off
to the death!

290
00:10:37,035 --> 00:10:39,319
Someone go watch
for the cops!

291
00:10:39,321 --> 00:10:41,404
Maybe we should have read up
on this town

292
00:10:41,406 --> 00:10:43,540
before booking our wedding.

293
00:10:43,542 --> 00:10:46,460
Let's do some,
"When you... I feel."

294
00:10:46,462 --> 00:10:47,861
All right, for example,

295
00:10:47,863 --> 00:10:51,164
when you don't
do trust falls,

296
00:10:51,166 --> 00:10:55,218
I feel like you
should do trust falls.

297
00:10:55,220 --> 00:10:57,838
So just do the
damn trust falls.

298
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:58,872
I'm driving a car, Clint.

299
00:10:58,874 --> 00:11:00,307
Okay,

300
00:11:00,309 --> 00:11:03,176
uh, Daphne, when you say
"Drill, baby, drill"

301
00:11:03,178 --> 00:11:06,062
every time
that we pass a gas station,

302
00:11:06,064 --> 00:11:08,014
I feel invalidated.

303
00:11:08,016 --> 00:11:10,517
Marshall, when you talk,
I feel shut up!

304
00:11:10,519 --> 00:11:12,385
That's very good, both of you.

305
00:11:12,387 --> 00:11:14,237
Really? Both of us?

306
00:11:14,239 --> 00:11:16,439
Name one energy
that's better than oil.

307
00:11:16,441 --> 00:11:17,991
Wind, solar, hydroelectric.

308
00:11:17,993 --> 00:11:19,576
You see what I've been dealing
with, Clint?

309
00:11:19,578 --> 00:11:21,862
? The sticky petroleum
clings... ?

310
00:11:21,864 --> 00:11:23,029
Please not now, Clint.

311
00:11:23,031 --> 00:11:25,732
? To the pelican's
broken wings ?

312
00:11:25,734 --> 00:11:29,669
? Hey, Mr. Oilman,
what have you done... ?

313
00:11:29,671 --> 00:11:31,571
Stop, stop, stop, please.
Enough! Clint,

314
00:11:31,573 --> 00:11:33,373
I'm tired of your beard
and I'm tired

315
00:11:33,375 --> 00:11:35,542
of this stupid therapy session.
And I'm tired

316
00:11:35,544 --> 00:11:39,078
of the way that your songs have
a-a laxative effect on Marvin!

317
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:41,080
And on me. Every time
Clint starts singing,

318
00:11:41,082 --> 00:11:42,849
I just got to go.
Yeah.

319
00:11:42,851 --> 00:11:46,753
It's like, uh, the only
trust fall when you sing

320
00:11:46,755 --> 00:11:50,724
is that I "trust"
that a piece of poop

321
00:11:50,726 --> 00:11:54,277
is gonna "fall" out
of my son's butt.

322
00:11:55,781 --> 00:11:58,064
Hey, Clint, how about that?

323
00:11:58,066 --> 00:11:59,733
You got us to agree on something.
Yeah.

324
00:11:59,735 --> 00:12:02,652
We both think you're a loser.

325
00:12:02,654 --> 00:12:04,771
This therapy works.

326
00:12:04,773 --> 00:12:06,156
No!

327
00:12:06,158 --> 00:12:08,124
That is not the way
therapy works at all!

328
00:12:08,126 --> 00:12:10,109
Do you think this is
some kind of a joke?!

329
00:12:10,111 --> 00:12:11,745
This is my career!

330
00:12:11,747 --> 00:12:14,664
I will not go back to
coaching the Browns!

331
00:12:14,666 --> 00:12:15,665
Why can't people take

332
00:12:15,667 --> 00:12:17,083
what I do seriously?!

333
00:12:17,085 --> 00:12:20,086
God!

334
00:12:22,457 --> 00:12:24,724
Oh, my God. One more.

335
00:12:24,726 --> 00:12:27,894
Oh, my God. Okay. Oh, my God.

336
00:12:30,315 --> 00:12:33,650
God, that was a lot of stairs.
I'm exhausted.

337
00:12:33,652 --> 00:12:35,635
My chest is on fire.

338
00:12:35,637 --> 00:12:36,987
Oh.

339
00:12:36,989 --> 00:12:41,074
Ooh! So, Mr. Arch-itect,

340
00:12:41,076 --> 00:12:42,826
what do we do now?

341
00:12:42,828 --> 00:12:45,412
Fall in love or something?

342
00:12:45,414 --> 00:12:47,497
<i>And, kids, as I stood</i>
<i>on that lighthouse</i>

343
00:12:47,499 --> 00:12:50,817
<i>and looked at that girl, I felt</i>
<i>something happen inside me,</i>

344
00:12:50,819 --> 00:12:53,336
<i>something that had only</i>
<i>happened one other time</i>

345
00:12:53,338 --> 00:12:55,255
<i>in my entire adult life.</i>

346
00:12:57,342 --> 00:12:59,042
<i>Okay, scrambled eggs.</i>

347
00:12:59,044 --> 00:13:00,844
Here we go.

348
00:13:00,846 --> 00:13:03,146
Where is the egg opener?

349
00:13:04,515 --> 00:13:07,333
Never mind. I'll pre-scramble
them. It's fine.

350
00:13:08,386 --> 00:13:11,004
Okay, fine, Loretta.
You know what? You win.

351
00:13:11,006 --> 00:13:11,838
I don't
know how

352
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:14,007
to cook egg.

353
00:13:14,009 --> 00:13:15,942
If you don't even know how
to make scrambled eggs,

354
00:13:15,944 --> 00:13:17,343
I just worry what
kind of breakfast

355
00:13:17,345 --> 00:13:19,980
you're gonna be serving
my grandchildren.

356
00:13:19,982 --> 00:13:21,781
Well, lucky you

357
00:13:21,783 --> 00:13:25,235
because that is one thing you
won't ever have to worry about.

358
00:13:33,244 --> 00:13:36,463
Mom, Robin
can't have kids.

359
00:13:39,248 --> 00:13:42,889
Every single job I take on,
it's always the same!

360
00:13:42,890 --> 00:13:45,474
"The coffee maker has to stay
in the office, Clint!"

361
00:13:45,476 --> 00:13:49,478
"You still have to wear pants
on Casual Friday, Clint!"

362
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:50,312
"We didn't

363
00:13:50,314 --> 00:13:51,563
hire you, Clint!"

364
00:13:51,565 --> 00:13:52,964
Well, God,
I'm-I'm...

365
00:13:52,966 --> 00:13:54,466
I'm just sick of it. I'm si...

366
00:13:54,468 --> 00:13:57,802
Ow. Ow. Oh, I can hear
my blood right now.

367
00:13:57,804 --> 00:13:59,938
I'm having an attack.
I'm having a blood attack.

368
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:01,106
A blood attack?

369
00:14:01,108 --> 00:14:02,441
Yeah. Pull over. I need...
I-I need to meditate.

370
00:14:02,443 --> 00:14:05,244
I got to get my heart rate down.
I'll... Ow! Pull over.

371
00:14:05,246 --> 00:14:07,412
We're in the middle of nowhere.
Pull over!

372
00:14:07,414 --> 00:14:10,282
Zitch dog, Labradoodle
in a Ford Fusion! Ow!

373
00:14:10,284 --> 00:14:11,783
God...

374
00:14:11,785 --> 00:14:13,919
Robin can't have kids?

375
00:14:13,921 --> 00:14:15,621
But you always wanted children.

376
00:14:15,623 --> 00:14:17,556
No, I always <i>liked</i> children.

377
00:14:17,558 --> 00:14:21,226
I've always <i>wanted</i> a Lamborghini
where there's a hot tub inside.

378
00:14:21,228 --> 00:14:23,378
God, I wish that existed.

379
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:25,264
So no grandkids.

380
00:14:26,049 --> 00:14:27,432
How long have you known
about this?

381
00:14:27,434 --> 00:14:29,468
I found out last fall.

382
00:14:29,470 --> 00:14:31,637
<i>Robin and I had been</i>
<i>hanging out downtown</i>

383
00:14:31,639 --> 00:14:34,323
<i>at this very cool secret bar.</i>

384
00:14:34,325 --> 00:14:37,609
What a lovely place!

385
00:14:37,611 --> 00:14:39,728
Have you ever had
sushi that fresh?

386
00:14:39,730 --> 00:14:42,447
Okay, I am never getting
on a mechanical bull again.

387
00:14:43,617 --> 00:14:46,535
I can't believe Marshall
and Lily missed out.

388
00:14:46,537 --> 00:14:49,071
Promise me,
if you ever have kids,

389
00:14:49,073 --> 00:14:51,039
you'll sometimes get
a babysitter

390
00:14:51,041 --> 00:14:52,857
and come have an epic night.

391
00:14:52,859 --> 00:14:56,495
Oh, and, P.S., bring the
babysitter, she sounds dirty.

392
00:14:56,497 --> 00:14:58,530
Actually, I, uh,
I can't have kids,

393
00:14:58,532 --> 00:15:00,082
so that's not an issue.

394
00:15:01,251 --> 00:15:02,534
Really?

395
00:15:02,536 --> 00:15:03,868
Yeah.

396
00:15:12,595 --> 00:15:15,147
Is it weird
that I'm hugging you like this?

397
00:15:15,999 --> 00:15:19,401
No, it's not weird.

398
00:15:22,972 --> 00:15:26,224
Now it's weird. Mm-hmm.
Yep, the rain makes it weird.

399
00:15:26,226 --> 00:15:29,611
Mom, I'm not marrying
some future possibility

400
00:15:29,613 --> 00:15:31,229
of starting a family.

401
00:15:32,365 --> 00:15:33,498
I'm marrying a girl.

402
00:15:34,417 --> 00:15:37,169
Who means more to me than kids.

403
00:15:37,787 --> 00:15:39,421
Or my career.

404
00:15:39,423 --> 00:15:42,291
Or even the Lambor-cuzzi,
patent pending.

405
00:15:43,259 --> 00:15:45,510
So please...

406
00:15:46,346 --> 00:15:47,629
...be nice to her?

407
00:15:50,166 --> 00:15:52,668
<i>This is ridiculous.</i>

408
00:15:52,670 --> 00:15:54,202
Get out there
and drag Clint's

409
00:15:54,204 --> 00:15:57,306
downward-facing ass back in here
so we can get going.

410
00:15:57,308 --> 00:15:59,891
Just let him do his thing.

411
00:16:01,928 --> 00:16:03,928
Do you know why
the Daphnes of the world

412
00:16:03,930 --> 00:16:05,530
always get to pick the music

413
00:16:05,532 --> 00:16:07,816
and the Marshalls pay
all the tolls?

414
00:16:07,818 --> 00:16:08,817
Because
the Marshalls

415
00:16:08,819 --> 00:16:10,619
are so concerned

416
00:16:10,621 --> 00:16:12,704
with letting everybody
do their thing,

417
00:16:12,706 --> 00:16:15,940
and the Daphnes
are taking care of Daphne.

418
00:16:15,942 --> 00:16:19,711
You can talk to me about solar
or wind or hydro-whatever,

419
00:16:19,713 --> 00:16:22,447
but the world is always gonna
push you around, Marshall.

420
00:16:22,449 --> 00:16:25,050
Until you learn
to go nuclear.

421
00:16:30,307 --> 00:16:31,947
What are you doing?

422
00:16:34,177 --> 00:16:35,844
Is this real?

423
00:16:35,846 --> 00:16:37,229
Are you doing this?

424
00:16:38,514 --> 00:16:39,848
We need some driving music.

425
00:16:39,850 --> 00:16:40,350
No!

426
00:16:44,971 --> 00:16:48,073
You threw a live grenade
into my marriage.

427
00:16:48,808 --> 00:16:51,660
You screwed up my whole world.

428
00:16:51,662 --> 00:16:54,746
So from now on...

429
00:16:54,748 --> 00:16:57,649
we listen to my music.

430
00:16:58,618 --> 00:17:02,153
? But I would walk 500 miles

431
00:17:02,155 --> 00:17:04,489
? And I would walk 500 more...

432
00:17:04,491 --> 00:17:06,258
I hate this song.

433
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:07,709
Give it time.

434
00:17:09,829 --> 00:17:13,348
Zitch dog, beagle
in a Beetle.

435
00:17:13,350 --> 00:17:15,884
Don't let Loretta
get to you.

436
00:17:15,886 --> 00:17:19,187
Hey, when your mom gets here,
do you want to all go--

437
00:17:19,189 --> 00:17:22,858
I don't know--
avoid jellyfish?

438
00:17:22,860 --> 00:17:23,725
She's not coming.

439
00:17:23,727 --> 00:17:25,277
What?

440
00:17:25,279 --> 00:17:26,978
I finally got a hold of her.

441
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:29,013
She, um, never got on the plane.

442
00:17:29,015 --> 00:17:30,565
She was too scared.

443
00:17:31,617 --> 00:17:33,151
She won't be
at her daughter's wedding.

444
00:17:40,294 --> 00:17:42,461
If that is the case...

445
00:17:42,463 --> 00:17:45,914
can we tell Barney
she's super fat?

446
00:17:45,916 --> 00:17:48,083
It would mean the world to me.

447
00:17:49,253 --> 00:17:50,802
Of course.

448
00:17:51,804 --> 00:17:53,221
Oh, here we go.

449
00:17:53,223 --> 00:17:54,589
Listen, Robin...
Loretta,

450
00:17:54,591 --> 00:17:57,041
not now. Robin just found out

451
00:17:57,043 --> 00:17:58,710
her mom's not coming
to the wedding.

452
00:18:02,648 --> 00:18:03,882
Oh.

453
00:18:03,884 --> 00:18:05,784
Well, uh, okay.

454
00:18:05,786 --> 00:18:07,002
Loretta...

455
00:18:07,004 --> 00:18:08,270
My name's Mom.

456
00:18:08,272 --> 00:18:10,388
Don't you ever call me
anything else.

457
00:18:10,390 --> 00:18:11,606
I'm Mom.

458
00:18:11,608 --> 00:18:13,892
Okay.

459
00:18:13,894 --> 00:18:15,093
Mom.

460
00:18:15,095 --> 00:18:17,329
I'm sorry.
Sometimes I get...

461
00:18:18,831 --> 00:18:20,499
...carried away.

462
00:18:23,252 --> 00:18:27,122
Your eggs are great, by the way.

463
00:18:27,124 --> 00:18:28,740
<i>Oh, mama,</i>

464
00:18:28,742 --> 00:18:30,509
that was some bad advice.

465
00:18:30,511 --> 00:18:31,760
Thanks, Lil.

466
00:18:32,428 --> 00:18:33,244
But you know what sucks?

467
00:18:33,246 --> 00:18:34,463
When I was
at the top

468
00:18:34,465 --> 00:18:35,630
of that lighthouse,

469
00:18:35,632 --> 00:18:37,432
despite everything else...

470
00:18:37,434 --> 00:18:40,385
Wow. It's like traveling
back in time.

471
00:18:40,387 --> 00:18:42,521
Just stop talking.

472
00:18:43,857 --> 00:18:45,307
<i>...it was breathtaking.</i>

473
00:18:45,309 --> 00:18:47,592
And I wasted it.

474
00:18:47,594 --> 00:18:49,611
I mean, how many places
have I ruined forever

475
00:18:49,613 --> 00:18:51,530
by being there
with the wrong girl?

476
00:18:51,532 --> 00:18:53,899
So come back
with the right girl.

477
00:18:53,901 --> 00:18:55,784
I don't know.

478
00:18:55,786 --> 00:18:58,069
I'm starting to think a person
gets a certain allotment

479
00:18:58,071 --> 00:19:00,772
of lighthouses per lifetime.

480
00:19:00,774 --> 00:19:03,041
And I've used all mine up.

481
00:19:03,043 --> 00:19:05,877
<i>And that, kids, is the kind</i>
<i>of stupid thing you say</i>

482
00:19:05,879 --> 00:19:08,112
<i>before you've met the person</i>
<i>who hits the reset button</i>

483
00:19:08,114 --> 00:19:10,665
<i>on the world,</i>
<i>who makes everything new again,</i>

484
00:19:10,667 --> 00:19:12,083
<i>who makes it seem ridiculous</i>

485
00:19:12,085 --> 00:19:14,219
<i>that you ever considered</i>
<i>settling,</i>

486
00:19:14,221 --> 00:19:16,671
<i>because not two years later...</i>

487
00:19:18,090 --> 00:19:20,291
Look at that.

488
00:19:23,846 --> 00:19:27,015
It's like traveling
back in time.

489
00:19:27,017 --> 00:19:30,018
That is exactly what I said.

490
00:19:30,020 --> 00:19:32,637
Why couldn't it have been you
here with me two years ago?

491
00:19:32,639 --> 00:19:34,906
That's probably
for the best.

492
00:19:34,908 --> 00:19:36,858
When you vomit, I vomit.

493
00:19:36,860 --> 00:19:38,309
You know that.

494
00:19:38,311 --> 00:19:42,697
Well, thanks for being
here with me now.

495
00:19:42,699 --> 00:19:44,482
Thanks for bringing me.

496
00:19:47,753 --> 00:19:49,821
Wow.

497
00:19:49,823 --> 00:19:53,658
It is just
bonkers beautiful here.

498
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:57,495
I don't know how you could
improve on a day like this.

499
00:20:02,301 --> 00:20:04,436
Well, I'm gonna try.

500
00:20:10,977 --> 00:20:12,561
Whoa.

501
00:20:14,447 --> 00:20:15,564
Will you...

502
00:20:15,566 --> 00:20:16,481
Yes.

503
00:20:16,483 --> 00:20:18,450
You didn't even let me...

504
00:20:18,452 --> 00:20:19,401
Yes.

505
00:20:19,403 --> 00:20:20,685
Marry me?

506
00:20:20,687 --> 00:20:21,820
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

507
00:20:21,822 --> 00:20:24,739
Yes, yes... yes.

508
00:20:27,044 --> 00:20:31,413
? Just try,
try a little tenderness ?

509
00:20:31,415 --> 00:20:33,798
? Yeah, yeah, yeah, you got to

510
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:36,301
? Know how to love her, man

511
00:20:36,303 --> 00:20:38,303
? Take this advice, man

512
00:20:38,305 --> 00:20:40,555
? You got to squeeze her

513
00:20:40,557 --> 00:20:42,057
? Don't tease her. ?
