1
00:00:04,255 --> 00:00:05,572
Ooh, Chicago!

2
00:00:05,574 --> 00:00:07,291
There is this pizza place
called Gazzola's.

3
00:00:07,293 --> 00:00:08,525
It's fantastic.

4
00:00:08,527 --> 00:00:10,694
It was closed down for a while,
but it just reopened.

5
00:00:10,696 --> 00:00:12,663
I'm sure they got
a Godzilla's in New York.

6
00:00:12,665 --> 00:00:13,997
We're not stopping.

7
00:00:14,949 --> 00:00:16,717
It's just pizza.

8
00:00:16,719 --> 00:00:18,669
Just... pizza?

9
00:00:19,487 --> 00:00:21,255
Let me tell you

10
00:00:21,257 --> 00:00:25,325
about the thing
you say is just pizza.

11
00:00:25,327 --> 00:00:27,377
We begin with the first bite.

12
00:00:27,379 --> 00:00:29,413
Oh, the crunch!

13
00:00:29,415 --> 00:00:30,714
And then the marinara.

14
00:00:30,716 --> 00:00:33,467
That roiling lava

15
00:00:33,469 --> 00:00:37,020
of tomato and oregano--
it overtakes you!

16
00:00:37,022 --> 00:00:40,006
I'm falling!

17
00:00:40,008 --> 00:00:43,243
And that's....
when she catches you.

18
00:00:43,245 --> 00:00:44,578
That chewy,

19
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:48,699
voluptuous mistress, Mozzarella.

20
00:00:50,118 --> 00:00:53,987
Her oven-kissed cheeks crackle
with warmth in your mouth,

21
00:00:53,989 --> 00:00:55,873
cradling the sauce
and the bread,

22
00:00:55,875 --> 00:00:58,325
letting you know
that from now on...

23
00:00:58,327 --> 00:01:02,129
this... is home.

24
00:01:03,131 --> 00:01:05,165
This pizza...

25
00:01:05,167 --> 00:01:07,334
is home.

26
00:01:09,003 --> 00:01:11,088
If it was so delicious,

27
00:01:11,090 --> 00:01:13,590
why'd they close it
in the first place?

28
00:01:13,592 --> 00:01:15,125
Rats.
We're not stopping!

29
00:01:15,127 --> 00:01:17,177
This road trip sucks!

00:01:30,191 --> 00:01:33,143
<i>Barney's bachelor</i>
<i>poker game was winding down.</i>

33
00:01:33,145 --> 00:01:34,728
<i>Tim Gunn, out.</i>

34
00:01:34,730 --> 00:01:37,864
<i>Lily, busted.</i>

<i>Marshpillow,</i>
<i>fluffed and turned down.</i>

36
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:43,503
<i>We were playing what we thought</i>
<i>was our final hand,</i>

37
00:01:43,505 --> 00:01:45,639
<i>and it was getting intense.</i>

38
00:01:45,641 --> 00:01:47,958
Action to Ranjit.

39
00:01:50,929 --> 00:01:52,613
Ranjit, action to you.

40
00:01:52,615 --> 00:01:54,681
What?!

41
00:01:54,683 --> 00:01:56,249
Hey, Ted, thanks
again for your gift.

42
00:01:56,251 --> 00:01:59,386
He gave us a framed photo
of all of us at the bar, and

43
00:01:59,388 --> 00:02:01,722
he's getting us
two other wedding gifts.

44
00:02:01,724 --> 00:02:03,890
What can I say? I just love
giving wedding gifts.

45
00:02:03,892 --> 00:02:05,309
I love giving
wedding gifts so much,

46
00:02:05,311 --> 00:02:08,028
I wish I could marry
giving-wedding-gifts,

47
00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:10,864
and then get myself
and giving-wedding-gifts

48
00:02:10,866 --> 00:02:13,183
a wedding gift.

49
00:02:13,185 --> 00:02:15,619
Maybe saying things like that's
why I am not married.

50
00:02:17,206 --> 00:02:19,706
<i>Kids, there's a story</i>
<i>behind that face.</i>

51
00:02:19,708 --> 00:02:22,125
<i>Six years earlier, a few weeks</i>
<i>after their wedding,</i>

52
00:02:22,127 --> 00:02:24,711
<i>Marshall and Lily were going</i>
<i>through their wedding gifts.</i>

53
00:02:24,713 --> 00:02:26,330
Well, that's weird.

54
00:02:26,332 --> 00:02:27,998
Did Ted get us anything?

55
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,267
Come on, Lily.

56
00:02:30,269 --> 00:02:31,802
Ted... Ted's our
best friend.

57
00:02:31,804 --> 00:02:34,788
If his gift hasn't arrived
yet, it's on the way.

58
00:02:34,790 --> 00:02:37,424
<i>But time passed,</i>
<i>and no gift arrived.</i>

59
00:02:37,426 --> 00:02:39,192
<i>Finally, Marshall started</i>
<i>dropping hints.</i>

60
00:02:39,194 --> 00:02:40,494
Hey, man,

61
00:02:40,496 --> 00:02:41,979
it was great having you
at our wedding.

62
00:02:41,981 --> 00:02:44,014
Thanks, Bro,
and thanks for this coffee.

63
00:02:44,016 --> 00:02:45,565
It is great.

64
00:02:45,567 --> 00:02:48,335
You were not wedding absent.

65
00:02:48,337 --> 00:02:50,354
No, sir.

66
00:02:50,356 --> 00:02:53,006
You were wedding <i>present.</i>

67
00:02:53,008 --> 00:02:55,709
Do I detect a note
of hazelnut?

68
00:02:57,396 --> 00:02:59,713
Wedding present.

69
00:03:01,833 --> 00:03:04,034
I think he got it.

70
00:03:05,169 --> 00:03:06,837
<i>But I didn't get it.</i>

71
00:03:06,839 --> 00:03:08,405
<i>More months passed.</i>

72
00:03:08,407 --> 00:03:10,173
<i>His hints got more desperate.</i>

73
00:03:10,175 --> 00:03:11,541
Happy Halloween!

74
00:03:11,543 --> 00:03:13,593
Yeah. What-what are
you supposed to be?

75
00:03:13,595 --> 00:03:15,595
Well, I'm a wedding present,
Ted!

76
00:03:15,597 --> 00:03:18,181
How could you not get me
a wedding present?

77
00:03:18,183 --> 00:03:22,102
I mean, how could you not get
that I am a wedding present?

78
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:25,305
Get me? A wedding present!

79
00:03:25,307 --> 00:03:28,675
Get me a wedding present.

80
00:03:28,677 --> 00:03:29,943
Why isn't he getting it?!

81
00:03:29,945 --> 00:03:31,111
I don't know.

82
00:03:31,113 --> 00:03:32,496
Why didn't you
get the message

83
00:03:32,498 --> 00:03:35,065
to dress up like a pregnant
teenager, home skillet?

84
00:03:35,067 --> 00:03:38,068
<i>But he kept on waiting</i>
<i>until the summer of 2008</i>

85
00:03:38,070 --> 00:03:39,503
<i>when I got engaged.</i>

86
00:03:39,505 --> 00:03:41,371
So Ted's getting married, huh?

87
00:03:41,373 --> 00:03:43,707
Bet he'd love a gift
from his old pal Marshall.

88
00:03:43,709 --> 00:03:44,991
Well, he can forget it!

89
00:03:44,993 --> 00:03:46,910
We're getting them a gift.

90
00:03:46,912 --> 00:03:48,178
But Lily, this is the dream.

91
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:50,480
This is the whole reason
we wanted Ted to <i>get</i> married.

92
00:03:50,482 --> 00:03:52,282
So we could not
give him a wedding gift,

93
00:03:52,284 --> 00:03:53,950
and he would know
exactly how it feels!

94
00:03:53,952 --> 00:03:57,020
Baby, I'm as pissed as you are,
but we're getting them a gift.

95
00:03:57,022 --> 00:03:58,422
We have to.

96
00:04:00,258 --> 00:04:02,426
Fine.

97
00:04:02,428 --> 00:04:05,228
We'll get them a gift.

98
00:04:05,230 --> 00:04:08,265
A gift that'll send
a message loud and clear.

99
00:04:08,267 --> 00:04:11,168
A gift-wrapping
station!

100
00:04:11,170 --> 00:04:13,820
Oh, boy. This time,

101
00:04:13,822 --> 00:04:15,939
he <i>has</i> to get it.

102
00:04:15,941 --> 00:04:18,442
<i>And not long after</i>
<i>that, a package arrived.</i>

103
00:04:18,444 --> 00:04:20,660
Oh, well, well, well.

104
00:04:20,662 --> 00:04:23,580
Package from one
Mr. Ted Mosby.

105
00:04:23,582 --> 00:04:25,499
It's a little late, but...

106
00:04:25,501 --> 00:04:27,751
What the balls is this?!

107
00:04:27,753 --> 00:04:29,753
It-It's a thank you note

108
00:04:29,755 --> 00:04:32,923
for the gift-wrapping station.

109
00:04:32,925 --> 00:04:35,408
<i>Which explains the face.</i>

110
00:04:35,410 --> 00:04:36,943
Wedding gift.

111
00:04:36,945 --> 00:04:38,411
Hey, Barney.

112
00:04:38,413 --> 00:04:39,980
I've got a wedding gift
for you, too.

113
00:04:39,982 --> 00:04:41,247
Don't get married.

114
00:04:41,249 --> 00:04:42,415
Ah.

115
00:04:42,417 --> 00:04:44,634
In fact, it comes
in His and Hers.

116
00:04:44,636 --> 00:04:46,019
Don't get married!

117
00:04:46,021 --> 00:04:47,304
Don't get married!

118
00:04:47,306 --> 00:04:48,638
Ah.

119
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:51,758
I'm not cheating!
Don't tell anyone!

120
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:53,226
I'll cut you in on half!

121
00:04:53,228 --> 00:04:54,795
Hey, Barney,

122
00:04:54,797 --> 00:04:58,448
can you ask James to stop
crapping all over marriage?

123
00:04:58,450 --> 00:05:00,300
He's not crapping on marriage.

124
00:05:00,302 --> 00:05:02,486
He literally drew this
on the toilet.

125
00:05:04,038 --> 00:05:06,523
Come on, Robin. Please
don't ask me to pick sides.

126
00:05:06,525 --> 00:05:08,959
In two days,
he's gonna be your brother, too.

127
00:05:08,961 --> 00:05:11,411
Just be honest and tell him
what's bothering you.

128
00:05:11,413 --> 00:05:13,697
Okay.

129
00:05:14,917 --> 00:05:16,216
Marshall, are you...?

130
00:05:16,218 --> 00:05:17,517
Hey, Andretti!

131
00:05:17,519 --> 00:05:19,503
Beat it!

132
00:05:19,505 --> 00:05:22,906
Marshall, are you sitting down?

133
00:05:22,908 --> 00:05:24,123
Well, I'm in a car,

134
00:05:24,125 --> 00:05:25,642
and you were pretty clear about

135
00:05:25,644 --> 00:05:27,177
the No-Teen-Wolfing
Now-That-I'm-A-Dad rule,

136
00:05:27,179 --> 00:05:29,062
so, yeah, I'm sitting down.

137
00:05:29,064 --> 00:05:32,933
Ted is getting Barney and Robin
three wedding gifts!

138
00:05:34,018 --> 00:05:36,019
I hate him.

139
00:05:36,021 --> 00:05:37,020
Lily,

140
00:05:37,022 --> 00:05:38,605
requesting permission
to make a stink?

141
00:05:38,607 --> 00:05:40,490
Stink away!

142
00:05:40,492 --> 00:05:44,110
Hurry up and get it over with.

143
00:05:45,863 --> 00:05:47,330
Oh, that's Marshall.

144
00:05:47,332 --> 00:05:48,582
I should take this.

145
00:05:48,584 --> 00:05:49,783
Well,

146
00:05:49,785 --> 00:05:52,936
call me Akira Yoshizawa.

147
00:05:54,539 --> 00:05:56,289
World's most famous origamist?

148
00:05:57,975 --> 00:06:00,260
I fold.

149
00:06:01,446 --> 00:06:04,614
Barney, here's a good one.

150
00:06:04,616 --> 00:06:05,549
What's the difference

151
00:06:05,551 --> 00:06:06,716
between a Journey song

152
00:06:06,718 --> 00:06:08,201
and a husband?

153
00:06:09,103 --> 00:06:11,388
A Journey song has a climax.

154
00:06:12,608 --> 00:06:13,907
I'm sorry, Robin.

155
00:06:13,909 --> 00:06:15,892
I'm just messing with you.

156
00:06:15,894 --> 00:06:17,176
Raise a hundred.

157
00:06:17,178 --> 00:06:19,112
No, it's fine.

158
00:06:19,114 --> 00:06:21,982
It's just funny hearing all
this anti-marriage stuff

159
00:06:21,984 --> 00:06:24,367
from a divorced guy who
still wears his wedding ring.

160
00:06:24,369 --> 00:06:26,286
What, this?
Mm.

161
00:06:26,288 --> 00:06:27,571
Only wear it because,

162
00:06:27,573 --> 00:06:30,407
nothing attracts a gay guy
faster than a wedding ring.

163
00:06:30,409 --> 00:06:31,992
Except saying hi to him.

164
00:06:31,994 --> 00:06:35,545
Or being in the same room,
or every app on my phone.

165
00:06:35,547 --> 00:06:38,548
People, it is a good time
to be gay.

166
00:06:38,550 --> 00:06:41,334
So you can just... you can take
that ring off anytime you want?

167
00:06:41,336 --> 00:06:42,619
Anytime.

168
00:06:42,621 --> 00:06:46,890
I'm all in.

169
00:06:46,892 --> 00:06:48,875
And raise you...

170
00:06:48,877 --> 00:06:51,094
one ring.

171
00:06:51,096 --> 00:06:53,430
Ooh!

172
00:06:55,650 --> 00:06:57,817
Fine.

173
00:06:57,819 --> 00:07:00,053
It's just a ring.

174
00:07:00,055 --> 00:07:03,189
Okay, let's see
what you got.

175
00:07:03,191 --> 00:07:05,942
Robin has three jacks, James

176
00:07:05,944 --> 00:07:07,077
has...

177
00:07:07,079 --> 00:07:09,946
just shy of a pair
of a sixes.

178
00:07:09,948 --> 00:07:12,198
Thank you.

179
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:13,166
Yeah.

180
00:07:13,168 --> 00:07:14,567
I'm gonna hit the gym.

181
00:07:14,569 --> 00:07:16,036
Let me know if you want
to get some dinner later.

182
00:07:16,038 --> 00:07:19,238
Oh, we'll give you a ring,
just not this one. Ho!

183
00:07:22,743 --> 00:07:24,144
You, Ted Mosby,

184
00:07:24,146 --> 00:07:26,379
never got me
and Lily a wedding gift!

185
00:07:26,381 --> 00:07:27,681
J'accuse!

186
00:07:27,683 --> 00:07:29,466
I did, too, get you a gift!

187
00:07:29,468 --> 00:07:31,184
It was a coffeemaker,

188
00:07:31,186 --> 00:07:33,603
and you never sent me
a thank you note!

189
00:07:33,605 --> 00:07:35,588
Oh.

190
00:07:35,590 --> 00:07:38,275
So-so... <i>me-cuse?</i>

191
00:07:38,277 --> 00:07:40,677
You-cuse!

192
00:07:40,679 --> 00:07:43,280
Robin, when I said, "Be honest
and say what's bothering you,"

193
00:07:43,282 --> 00:07:45,365
I meant, stuff it down
and never do anything about it.

194
00:07:45,367 --> 00:07:46,583
How did you not get that?

195
00:07:46,585 --> 00:07:48,818
It's fine.
He's a grown-up.

196
00:07:50,238 --> 00:07:53,657
What did you do
to my little boy?

197
00:07:54,943 --> 00:07:56,826
Hi, Mom.

198
00:07:59,210 --> 00:08:02,132
You get your brother's ring back!
Mom, please don't make me

199
00:08:02,133 --> 00:08:04,288
take sides!
That's your brother out there.

200
00:08:04,289 --> 00:08:06,372
You two shared bunk
beds and baseball mitts,

201
00:08:06,374 --> 00:08:09,308
and, when you were hungry,
these supple breasts.

202
00:08:09,310 --> 00:08:11,210
Arguably a little too long.

203
00:08:11,212 --> 00:08:12,979
Stinsons stand up
for each other.

204
00:08:12,981 --> 00:08:14,213
Take care of this!

205
00:08:14,215 --> 00:08:16,132
I...
I'm gonna play some cards.

206
00:08:16,134 --> 00:08:18,935
All right, chumps.

207
00:08:18,937 --> 00:08:21,554
I'm gonna tell you what I
told Frampton's guitar tech

208
00:08:21,556 --> 00:08:24,774
when he couldn't find
a condom: let's gamble.

209
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:28,277
You gave us a coffeemaker?

210
00:08:28,279 --> 00:08:30,263
Not just <i>ah</i> coffeemaker.

211
00:08:30,265 --> 00:08:33,065
I asked what they used
at your favorite coffeehouse

212
00:08:33,067 --> 00:08:35,952
and got you that exact...
one tier down model.

213
00:08:35,954 --> 00:08:39,388
And you know
what you got me? Huh?

214
00:08:39,390 --> 00:08:41,207
<i>No thank you note.</i>

215
00:08:41,209 --> 00:08:43,259
<i>So I started dropping hints</i>
<i>about it.</i>

216
00:08:43,261 --> 00:08:45,494
Do I detect a note of hazelnut?

217
00:08:45,496 --> 00:08:46,662
Wedding present.

218
00:08:46,664 --> 00:08:48,681
Kind of want to say thank you

219
00:08:48,683 --> 00:08:51,217
to that note of hazelnut.

220
00:08:51,219 --> 00:08:53,252
Thank you... note.

221
00:08:54,656 --> 00:08:57,023
Wedding... present.

222
00:08:57,025 --> 00:09:00,042
Anyway...

223
00:09:00,044 --> 00:09:02,161
Thank you note.

224
00:09:04,014 --> 00:09:06,732
Yeah, he got it.

225
00:09:06,734 --> 00:09:08,651
But you never got it!

226
00:09:08,653 --> 00:09:10,603
I drank so much coffee
that year,

227
00:09:10,605 --> 00:09:11,904
hoping you'd take the hint,

228
00:09:11,906 --> 00:09:14,690
my resting pulse was like
the drum solo from "Wipeout."

229
00:09:14,692 --> 00:09:17,410
And then, uh,
Halloween rolled around.

230
00:09:17,412 --> 00:09:18,611
Get me a wedding present.

231
00:09:18,613 --> 00:09:20,830
On that note...

232
00:09:20,832 --> 00:09:22,331
I think you'll like my costume.

233
00:09:22,333 --> 00:09:23,649
Mm.

234
00:09:23,651 --> 00:09:26,985
I'm a thank you note.

235
00:09:26,987 --> 00:09:28,487
Thank you note.
Ah.

236
00:09:28,489 --> 00:09:31,540
Guess you could say
that we sort of go together.

237
00:09:31,542 --> 00:09:33,259
That's right, Marshall.
That's right.

238
00:09:33,261 --> 00:09:35,294
When someone gets you a gift,

239
00:09:35,296 --> 00:09:38,097
you give them
a thank you note.

240
00:09:38,099 --> 00:09:39,215
That is how it works.

241
00:09:39,217 --> 00:09:41,367
Give a gift, get a note.

242
00:09:41,369 --> 00:09:42,752
Agreed.
Exactly.

243
00:09:42,754 --> 00:09:43,819
Exactly.

244
00:09:43,821 --> 00:09:46,856
Exactly.
Exactly.

245
00:09:49,359 --> 00:09:51,644
I think he got it.

246
00:09:51,646 --> 00:09:54,063
Yeah. Yeah, he got it.

247
00:09:54,065 --> 00:09:56,282
I have to find a bathroom.

248
00:09:57,701 --> 00:09:58,784
I didn't get it!

249
00:09:58,786 --> 00:10:00,403
And I thought for sure
you'd get it

250
00:10:00,405 --> 00:10:03,105
when I sent that thank you note
for the wrapping station.

251
00:10:03,107 --> 00:10:06,826
<i>"Dear Marshall and Lily,</i>

252
00:10:06,828 --> 00:10:09,628
<i>"this is a thank you note</i>
<i>to thank you</i>

253
00:10:09,630 --> 00:10:12,248
<i>"for the gift-wrapping station.</i>

254
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:15,167
<i>"Because even though</i>
<i>the wedding never happened,</i>

255
00:10:15,169 --> 00:10:18,921
<i>"there's one thing that</i>
<i>didn't leave me at the altar,</i>

256
00:10:18,923 --> 00:10:21,757
<i>and that's my manners."</i>

257
00:10:21,759 --> 00:10:23,092
I can't believe this.

258
00:10:23,094 --> 00:10:24,643
Eriksens send thank you notes.

259
00:10:24,645 --> 00:10:26,679
It's the one thing
that we always do!

260
00:10:26,681 --> 00:10:28,681
We even have
a family saying about it.

261
00:10:28,683 --> 00:10:30,566
"Lick it, before you stick it!"

262
00:10:30,568 --> 00:10:33,319
"It" being the stamp
on the thank you note,

263
00:10:33,321 --> 00:10:35,521
before you stick it
in the mailbox.

264
00:10:35,523 --> 00:10:37,222
I will make this right!

265
00:10:37,224 --> 00:10:38,691
I know, right?

266
00:10:38,693 --> 00:10:40,609
Hey, listen, we're about
to go through a tunnel.

267
00:10:40,611 --> 00:10:41,894
Guys, big dilemma.

268
00:10:41,896 --> 00:10:44,229
My mom's insisting
that I get Robin

269
00:10:44,231 --> 00:10:47,733
to give James his ring back,
but Robin's refusing.

270
00:10:47,735 --> 00:10:50,503
But James seems like
he's really upset.

271
00:10:50,505 --> 00:10:52,588
But Robin's
gonna be my wife.

272
00:10:52,590 --> 00:10:54,573
But James
is my brother.

273
00:10:54,575 --> 00:10:56,592
But Robin lets me do sex to her.

274
00:10:56,594 --> 00:10:58,177
But I have

275
00:10:58,179 --> 00:11:00,846
to spend eternity
in my mom's mausoleum.

276
00:11:00,848 --> 00:11:03,966
I just wish there was a way
I didn't have to take sides!

277
00:11:03,968 --> 00:11:06,051
What should I do?!

278
00:11:07,855 --> 00:11:09,088
Choose your wife.

279
00:11:09,090 --> 00:11:11,423
You always choose
your wife. Easy.

280
00:11:11,425 --> 00:11:13,976
Got any other stumpers,
like how to answer

281
00:11:13,978 --> 00:11:15,428
"Does this make me look fat?"

282
00:11:15,430 --> 00:11:17,980
Well, maybe a little around
the hips but no more than usual.

283
00:11:17,982 --> 00:11:19,532
You're getting married,

284
00:11:19,534 --> 00:11:22,100
so I will deal with that
one after your honeymoon.

285
00:11:22,102 --> 00:11:23,202
<i>And she did.</i>

286
00:11:23,204 --> 00:11:26,188
Belize was amazi...

287
00:11:29,076 --> 00:11:32,378
In marriage, being right is less
important than being supportive.

288
00:11:32,380 --> 00:11:35,798
happy wife
equals happy life.

289
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:38,134
Wow, thanks.
That's some great advice, Lil.

290
00:11:38,136 --> 00:11:39,969
I knew I could count on you.

291
00:11:42,656 --> 00:11:45,007
He's gotten very respectful
with his fake listening.

292
00:11:45,009 --> 00:11:46,308
Anyway, Lily,

293
00:11:46,310 --> 00:11:47,810
I told Marshall this
already, but...

294
00:11:47,812 --> 00:11:49,728
don't worry about not sending
a thank you note

295
00:11:49,730 --> 00:11:52,148
for the coffeemaker. It's cool.

296
00:11:52,150 --> 00:11:55,384
Uh, we did send a thank you note
for the coffeemaker.

297
00:11:55,386 --> 00:11:57,987
Uh... no, you didn't.

298
00:11:57,989 --> 00:12:00,990
Uh... yes, we did.

299
00:12:00,992 --> 00:12:02,908
To Stuart and Claudia,

300
00:12:02,910 --> 00:12:05,778
the people who gave us
the coffeemaker.

301
00:12:05,780 --> 00:12:09,365
Uh...

302
00:12:09,367 --> 00:12:10,900
what?

303
00:12:10,902 --> 00:12:12,218
Hey, you two!

304
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:13,469
Hey.
Hey.

305
00:12:13,471 --> 00:12:15,421
Hey, thanks again
for that coffeemaker.

306
00:12:15,423 --> 00:12:17,089
We use it all the time.

307
00:12:17,091 --> 00:12:19,592
Especially when Ted's over.

308
00:12:19,594 --> 00:12:20,676
Yeah, it's
a great machine.

309
00:12:20,678 --> 00:12:22,962
We have one at home
and we love it.

310
00:12:22,964 --> 00:12:25,848
Did I forget
to get you a wedding gift?

311
00:12:26,533 --> 00:12:27,716
What kind of monster am I?

312
00:12:27,718 --> 00:12:29,468
Mosbys always give
wedding gifts.

313
00:12:29,470 --> 00:12:32,221
We even have an expression:
"Wrap it before you tap it."

314
00:12:32,223 --> 00:12:33,472
You know,

315
00:12:33,474 --> 00:12:34,523
wrap the gift

316
00:12:34,525 --> 00:12:36,174
before you tap the person
on the shoulder

317
00:12:36,176 --> 00:12:37,610
and say, "Here's your gift."

318
00:12:37,612 --> 00:12:40,629
I will make this right.

319
00:12:41,514 --> 00:12:42,982
Robin? Two things:

320
00:12:42,984 --> 00:12:44,483
number one, are you
dropping heat right now?

321
00:12:44,485 --> 00:12:46,118
No.
Great.

322
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:47,953
Number two.

323
00:12:47,955 --> 00:12:50,289
Nice.
Thanks. Anyway,

324
00:12:50,291 --> 00:12:51,740
I came up with an amazing plan

325
00:12:51,742 --> 00:12:53,292
that I think
will make everyone happy.

326
00:12:53,294 --> 00:12:56,862
Step one: you let my mom win the
ring back in a hand of poker.

327
00:12:56,864 --> 00:12:58,747
Step two...

328
00:12:58,749 --> 00:12:59,915
No, that's all the steps.

329
00:12:59,917 --> 00:13:01,050
What do you think?

330
00:13:01,052 --> 00:13:04,053
So your plan is
you do absolutely nothing

331
00:13:04,055 --> 00:13:05,588
to get your fianc?e's back.

332
00:13:05,590 --> 00:13:06,722
Okay.

333
00:13:06,724 --> 00:13:09,058
Let me propose
a different plan.

334
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:10,392
Step one...

335
00:13:10,394 --> 00:13:13,178
Good game, everybody!

336
00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:15,331
And that's all the steps.

337
00:13:19,152 --> 00:13:22,021
That's a really
pretty bra, Mom.

338
00:13:25,104 --> 00:13:27,434
Well, I'd better leave now
before I lose

339
00:13:27,435 --> 00:13:28,717
any more of my dignity,

340
00:13:28,719 --> 00:13:30,319
the likelihood
of which

341
00:13:30,321 --> 00:13:33,889
is increasing every moment
in this very chilly room.

342
00:13:33,891 --> 00:13:35,641
Oh...

343
00:13:36,443 --> 00:13:38,761
Not good, Robin.

344
00:13:38,763 --> 00:13:40,396
Very not good.

345
00:13:40,398 --> 00:13:42,131
How do you
keep winning, anyway?

346
00:13:42,133 --> 00:13:43,632
Well, to the keen observer,

347
00:13:43,634 --> 00:13:47,553
all of you Stinsons have
the same <i>very</i> subtle tell.

348
00:13:48,188 --> 00:13:49,104
Whenever you're bluffing,

349
00:13:49,106 --> 00:13:50,940
you say the word "bluff."

350
00:13:50,942 --> 00:13:52,558
Hey, I'm hungry. Uh...

351
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:54,426
should we get
some bluffalo wings?

352
00:13:54,428 --> 00:13:57,062
Raise you $20.

353
00:13:57,064 --> 00:14:00,616
When I walked in, I saw
an all-you-can-eat bluffet.

354
00:14:00,618 --> 00:14:02,768
Raise $50.

355
00:14:02,770 --> 00:14:06,038
Mmm... I could use
a bluffberry muffin.

356
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:08,073
A blueberry bluffin. Sorry.

357
00:14:08,075 --> 00:14:11,126
A bluebluffy muffbluff. All in.

358
00:14:11,128 --> 00:14:12,294
I don't believe it.

359
00:14:12,296 --> 00:14:14,380
Robin, you've got
to give her that blouse back.

360
00:14:14,382 --> 00:14:15,781
She loves that blouse.

361
00:14:15,783 --> 00:14:20,719
She got those sequins from
Rick James...'s open casket.

362
00:14:20,721 --> 00:14:21,921
Nope. Not happening.

363
00:14:21,923 --> 00:14:25,975
Woman, as your bridegroom,
I command you!

364
00:14:25,977 --> 00:14:27,259
We'll leave and

365
00:14:27,261 --> 00:14:30,295
give you guys
some privacy.

366
00:14:31,064 --> 00:14:32,965
You, uh,

367
00:14:32,967 --> 00:14:35,017
want to take back
that "I command you" thing?

368
00:14:35,019 --> 00:14:36,352
Please can I?

369
00:14:36,354 --> 00:14:38,437
Why is this so important to you?

370
00:14:38,439 --> 00:14:40,272
Because it's my family.

371
00:14:40,274 --> 00:14:44,159
And, so help me, you and I
will never have sex again

372
00:14:44,161 --> 00:14:46,144
if you don't give back
their bluff.

373
00:14:46,146 --> 00:14:47,830
Stuff! Damn it.

374
00:14:47,832 --> 00:14:49,815
Look, I just...
I want to feel like

375
00:14:49,817 --> 00:14:52,368
you're on my side
once in a while. That's all.

376
00:14:52,370 --> 00:14:53,535
Look, I'm gonna
be your wife,

377
00:14:53,537 --> 00:14:54,870
for God's sakes.

378
00:14:54,872 --> 00:14:56,221
But, look,

379
00:14:56,223 --> 00:14:58,958
if it's... if it's
that important to you, here.

380
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:01,159
Do what you want.

381
00:15:01,161 --> 00:15:02,845
Thank you.

382
00:15:02,847 --> 00:15:06,682
And please don't play
strip poker with my mom again.

383
00:15:06,684 --> 00:15:09,835
It's all kinds of confusing.

384
00:15:17,678 --> 00:15:21,814
Oh, that's where
my phone is.

385
00:15:21,816 --> 00:15:24,116
I wasn't eavesdropping.
Hey, baby.

386
00:15:24,118 --> 00:15:25,951
Lily, we were wrong
the whole time.

387
00:15:25,953 --> 00:15:27,569
Ted got us the coffeemaker!

388
00:15:27,571 --> 00:15:29,021
He's a wonderful man!

389
00:15:29,023 --> 00:15:33,025
What? No. Claudia and Stuart
gave us our coffeemaker.

390
00:15:33,027 --> 00:15:35,861
Ted's a rat bastard!
Never mention his name again!

391
00:15:35,863 --> 00:15:36,879
Your coffeemaker?

392
00:15:36,881 --> 00:15:37,830
Ted got you that.

393
00:15:37,832 --> 00:15:38,914
I was with him
when he bought it.

394
00:15:38,916 --> 00:15:40,215
I don't know what to feel!

395
00:15:40,217 --> 00:15:42,267
But Stuart said
he got it for us.

396
00:15:42,269 --> 00:15:44,086
Stuart and Claudia
checked in.

397
00:15:44,088 --> 00:15:45,587
I saw them in the lobby.

398
00:15:47,140 --> 00:15:48,540
Let's go get
to the bottom of this.

399
00:15:52,595 --> 00:15:53,562
Stuart,

400
00:15:53,564 --> 00:15:55,397
no B.S., did you really get us

401
00:15:55,399 --> 00:15:57,232
that coffeemaker
for our wedding?

402
00:15:57,234 --> 00:15:58,667
Of course.

403
00:15:58,669 --> 00:16:01,170
What a crazy
thing to ask.

404
00:16:01,172 --> 00:16:02,705
They never give you enough
of these things.

405
00:16:02,707 --> 00:16:04,773
Oh, my God.

406
00:16:04,775 --> 00:16:06,859
Ted got us
that coffeemaker,

407
00:16:06,861 --> 00:16:09,078
and you just played it off
as your gift.

408
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:12,247
You're a weasel. Admit it.

409
00:16:12,249 --> 00:16:13,332
No, that's insane.

410
00:16:13,334 --> 00:16:14,399
Really?

411
00:16:14,834 --> 00:16:15,834
Housekeeping!

412
00:16:15,836 --> 00:16:16,919
Conditioner thief!

413
00:16:16,921 --> 00:16:18,837
Okay, shh, shh.
Yes, I am a weasel.

414
00:16:18,839 --> 00:16:22,041
I ripped the card off Ted's gift
and I wrote my name on it.

415
00:16:22,043 --> 00:16:23,926
Does Claudia know about this?

416
00:16:23,928 --> 00:16:26,512
No. Please don't tell her.

417
00:16:26,514 --> 00:16:29,465
That gift was a turning point
for us.

418
00:16:29,467 --> 00:16:31,133
Ah.

419
00:16:31,135 --> 00:16:33,068
I got to admit,

420
00:16:33,070 --> 00:16:36,855
I came pretty close
to leaving you.

421
00:16:36,857 --> 00:16:39,692
Bags packed, plane
ticket purchased,

422
00:16:39,694 --> 00:16:41,927
topless pics sent to your
brother, the whole nine.

423
00:16:41,929 --> 00:16:46,065
But seeing that you got our
friends such a nice gift,

424
00:16:46,067 --> 00:16:49,501
ah, it just really puts
you in a whole new light.

425
00:16:49,503 --> 00:16:51,704
Oh.

426
00:16:52,622 --> 00:16:56,158
I'm a pretty great guy.
Oh.

427
00:16:58,211 --> 00:16:59,840
And since that day, on the

428
00:16:59,865 --> 00:17:01,564
foundation of that coffeemaker,

429
00:17:01,565 --> 00:17:05,617
we've built a strong,
nurturing relationship.

430
00:17:05,619 --> 00:17:10,455
Well, out of respect for your
marriage, I won't say anything.

431
00:17:10,457 --> 00:17:13,058
Say hi to Claudia
when she gets out of the shower.

432
00:17:13,060 --> 00:17:14,843
That's not Claudia. Good night.

433
00:17:16,396 --> 00:17:18,180
Tap tap.

434
00:17:18,182 --> 00:17:20,149
Look what I wrapped!

435
00:17:20,784 --> 00:17:21,950
What?

436
00:17:23,971 --> 00:17:26,772
So, I went to give James
his ring back...

437
00:17:27,490 --> 00:17:29,992
Glad you came
to your senses.

438
00:17:29,994 --> 00:17:32,778
You can't let being married
keep you from being you.

439
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:33,946
It's like Tom,

440
00:17:33,948 --> 00:17:36,314
always telling me I spend
too much time at the gym.

441
00:17:36,316 --> 00:17:37,399
Exactly. Is it so wrong

442
00:17:37,401 --> 00:17:39,151
if you want to work out
a couple times a week?

443
00:17:39,153 --> 00:17:40,986
Right. Or a couple times a day.

444
00:17:40,988 --> 00:17:42,204
Or a couple times...

445
00:17:42,206 --> 00:17:44,256
A couple times a day? Really?

446
00:17:44,258 --> 00:17:47,042
A few hours before work,
a few hours after.

447
00:17:47,044 --> 00:17:50,129
Only way to keep up
the chocolate xylophone.

448
00:17:51,615 --> 00:17:53,849
Still, that's a lot of time
at the gym.

449
00:17:53,851 --> 00:17:55,501
Especially with two kids.

450
00:17:55,503 --> 00:17:56,852
It's like
I always said to Tom,

451
00:17:56,854 --> 00:17:58,804
"I've got to stay in shape

452
00:17:58,806 --> 00:18:00,172
in case I'm ever single again."

453
00:18:00,174 --> 00:18:02,741
And, hello, I was right.

454
00:18:02,743 --> 00:18:05,394
Oh, my God.

455
00:18:05,396 --> 00:18:08,113
I think I finally understand
what Lily was mumbling

456
00:18:08,115 --> 00:18:10,199
in my peripheral vision earlier.

457
00:18:11,034 --> 00:18:12,401
I'm marrying Robin

458
00:18:12,403 --> 00:18:13,852
so I can be part of a team,

459
00:18:13,854 --> 00:18:16,405
not just some guy alone at a gym

460
00:18:16,407 --> 00:18:18,207
with admittedly amazing abs.

461
00:18:18,209 --> 00:18:19,374
Thanks, Bro.

462
00:18:19,376 --> 00:18:22,361
No. Thank you, Bro.

463
00:18:24,430 --> 00:18:26,548
You're not getting this ring.

464
00:18:26,550 --> 00:18:28,801
I'm always gonna have your back.

465
00:18:28,803 --> 00:18:30,352
No matter what.

466
00:18:30,354 --> 00:18:32,805
Thank you.

467
00:18:32,807 --> 00:18:34,289
I love you.
Mmm,

468
00:18:34,291 --> 00:18:35,974
I love you, too.

469
00:18:37,377 --> 00:18:39,377
Oh, oh! I almost didn't
tell you the best part!

470
00:18:39,379 --> 00:18:40,212
There's more!

471
00:18:40,214 --> 00:18:41,463
Really?

472
00:18:41,465 --> 00:18:44,099
James, let me spell this out
for you:

473
00:18:44,101 --> 00:18:46,151
now that I've got Robin,

474
00:18:46,153 --> 00:18:48,737
we are not brothers anymore.

475
00:18:48,739 --> 00:18:49,655
What?!

476
00:18:49,657 --> 00:18:51,323
Uh-huh.

477
00:18:51,325 --> 00:18:53,075
If you and
Robin are both

478
00:18:53,077 --> 00:18:55,077
ever hanging from a cliff

479
00:18:55,079 --> 00:18:56,995
and I have one hand free,

480
00:18:56,997 --> 00:18:58,363
enjoy the fall.

481
00:18:58,365 --> 00:18:59,865
Uh, buh-bye.

482
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:02,417
If you...
Oh, Mom! Good!

483
00:19:02,419 --> 00:19:03,535
You should hear this, too.

484
00:19:03,537 --> 00:19:06,455
This mother-son thing--
it's over.

485
00:19:06,457 --> 00:19:07,756
It's been
a nice few decades,

486
00:19:07,758 --> 00:19:09,458
but I've got a wife now,

487
00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:11,409
so you mean <i>nothing</i> to me.

488
00:19:11,411 --> 00:19:13,345
Oh, and me coming over

489
00:19:13,347 --> 00:19:14,513
for Thanksgiving and Christmas,

490
00:19:14,515 --> 00:19:15,464
that's done!

491
00:19:15,466 --> 00:19:16,798
No more of that!

492
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:18,016
And you know why?

493
00:19:18,018 --> 00:19:19,935
Because Robin said so!

494
00:19:19,937 --> 00:19:22,921
This came directly from her!

495
00:19:23,756 --> 00:19:27,592
See ya, losers!

496
00:19:27,594 --> 00:19:28,777
Oh, my God.

497
00:19:28,779 --> 00:19:29,778
Yeah.

498
00:19:29,780 --> 00:19:31,930
Fianc? of the year?

499
00:19:31,932 --> 00:19:34,983
I think I know what's next.
Oh, God.

500
00:19:34,985 --> 00:19:37,319
Oh, God. I can't leave this room
for the rest of the weekend.

501
00:19:37,321 --> 00:19:41,907
I'm sure we can find
something to do, eh?

502
00:19:41,909 --> 00:19:43,642
<i>Ted, I'm so sorry!</i>

503
00:19:43,644 --> 00:19:45,627
No, I'm sorry.

504
00:19:45,629 --> 00:19:47,546
I shouldn't have spent the last
six years passive-aggressively

505
00:19:47,548 --> 00:19:49,581
drinking gallons
of coffee around you.

506
00:19:49,583 --> 00:19:51,133
And I shouldn't have taken
that sewing class

507
00:19:51,135 --> 00:19:53,502
to learn how to make
that wedding present costume.

508
00:19:53,504 --> 00:19:55,671
I regret all of it.
Me, too!

509
00:19:55,673 --> 00:19:57,973
Except I actually don't regret
that sewing class.

510
00:19:57,975 --> 00:20:00,458
I learned a fun and useful
lifetime skill.

511
00:20:00,460 --> 00:20:03,312
But, seriously,
even without the coffeemaker,

512
00:20:03,314 --> 00:20:05,314
you've given us more
than enough.

513
00:20:05,316 --> 00:20:08,483
Well, there is one more gift
on the way.

514
00:20:08,485 --> 00:20:10,903
Whatever it is, send it back.

515
00:20:10,905 --> 00:20:12,971
It's a little late for that.

516
00:20:14,073 --> 00:20:15,691
Marshall Eriksen?!

517
00:20:15,693 --> 00:20:17,075
Yes?!

518
00:20:17,077 --> 00:20:19,528
I got your pizza!

519
00:20:19,530 --> 00:20:21,113
Oh, Ted!

520
00:20:21,115 --> 00:20:23,248
You are the best friend ever!

521
00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:24,950
Don't say another word,
Marshall.

522
00:20:24,952 --> 00:20:27,319
Save it for the thank you note.

523
00:20:27,321 --> 00:20:28,486
You got it, buddy!

524
00:20:28,488 --> 00:20:29,621
<i>And, kids,</i>

525
00:20:29,623 --> 00:20:30,706
<i>I got that thank you note</i>

526
00:20:30,708 --> 00:20:33,658
<i>four months later.</i>

527
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:35,877
<i>Four months.</i>

528
00:20:39,127 --> 00:20:40,360
Uh, here's
your blouse back.

529
00:20:41,350 --> 00:20:43,167
Is there any way
we could just, um...

530
00:20:43,169 --> 00:20:44,702
forget about all this?

531
00:20:44,704 --> 00:20:47,521
Oh, no, dear,
you keep the blouse.

532
00:20:47,523 --> 00:20:50,458
Think of it
as your consolation prize.

533
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:51,959
Consolation prize?

534
00:20:52,794 --> 00:20:55,079
You won the battle.

535
00:20:55,081 --> 00:20:57,248
But I'll win the war.

536
00:20:59,551 --> 00:21:01,201
