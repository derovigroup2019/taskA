1
00:00:04,504 --> 00:00:06,021
So?
No.

2
00:00:06,023 --> 00:00:07,756
No. You-You were in.

3
00:00:07,758 --> 00:00:09,508
I said, "Have you met Ted"
and everything.

4
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:11,126
How could that not work?
I don't know,

5
00:00:11,128 --> 00:00:13,128
we introduced ourselves,
I bought her a drink,

6
00:00:13,130 --> 00:00:14,346
told her I loved her...

7
00:00:14,348 --> 00:00:16,048
What?
I'm kidding.

8
00:00:16,050 --> 00:00:20,018
Hold on, Roxanne-- if that
really is your name.

9
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:21,854
It's not. It's Robin.

10
00:00:21,856 --> 00:00:24,356
You played "Have You Met Ted"
without me?

11
00:00:24,358 --> 00:00:26,725
In <i>my</i> bar with <i>my</i> Ted?

12
00:00:26,727 --> 00:00:31,063
Maybe stealing a bro's wingman
is okay back in...

13
00:00:31,065 --> 00:00:34,432
I'm sorry, what's the name of
this third world banana republic

14
00:00:34,434 --> 00:00:35,951
you claim to be from?

15
00:00:35,953 --> 00:00:38,603
Canada.

16
00:00:38,605 --> 00:00:41,073
I have literally
never heard of that place.

17
00:00:41,075 --> 00:00:42,741
When'd you move
here, anyway?

18
00:00:42,743 --> 00:00:43,742
Two months ago.

19
00:00:43,744 --> 00:00:44,910
How do you like it?
Honestly,

20
00:00:44,912 --> 00:00:46,578
it-it's been
a little tough.

21
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:49,465
I moved here for this on-air
reporter job at Metro News 1

22
00:00:49,467 --> 00:00:51,416
thinking it was gonna
be my big break,

23
00:00:51,418 --> 00:00:52,417
only to find out

24
00:00:52,419 --> 00:00:54,119
that our viewership
mostly consists

25
00:00:54,121 --> 00:00:55,304
of DMV waiting rooms

26
00:00:55,306 --> 00:00:57,506
and people plugging in their
TV for the first time.

27
00:00:58,458 --> 00:01:01,293
To top it all off,
I have no friends.

28
00:01:02,095 --> 00:01:04,596
Um... wrong.

29
00:01:04,598 --> 00:01:05,848
You have four friends
right here.

30
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:08,133
Right, guys?
Uh, yeah.

31
00:01:08,135 --> 00:01:09,935
You're totally in our gang,
now. And once you're in,

32
00:01:09,937 --> 00:01:11,270
you're in for life, right?

33
00:01:11,272 --> 00:01:13,071
She's in.
Oh. All right.

34
00:01:13,073 --> 00:01:14,773
She's in.
Welcome.

35
00:01:14,775 --> 00:01:16,742
Well, if I'm in, I should
get the next round.

36
00:01:16,744 --> 00:01:18,193
Whoa, whoa,
Ooh,

37
00:01:18,195 --> 00:01:19,912
I like this girl.
ho, ho.

38
00:01:20,914 --> 00:01:23,115
I'm serious, I
like this girl.

39
00:01:23,117 --> 00:01:25,817
And we need some estrogen
up in this bitch.

40
00:01:25,819 --> 00:01:28,620
All we ever talk about
is Scotch and sports.

41
00:01:28,622 --> 00:01:30,655
Five Glen McKennas,
21 years, neat.

42
00:01:30,657 --> 00:01:32,708
And switch it
to the hockey game, 'cause

43
00:01:32,710 --> 00:01:35,093
my Canucks are gonna
bury the Bruins, yo.

44
00:01:35,095 --> 00:01:37,045
So here's the deal
with the deal.

45
00:01:37,047 --> 00:01:38,496
Robin's my new
best friend--

46
00:01:38,498 --> 00:01:39,965
nobody bangs her.

47
00:01:39,967 --> 00:01:40,933
Hey, hey,

48
00:01:40,935 --> 00:01:42,217
hey, she only rejected me

49
00:01:42,219 --> 00:01:44,436
three times,
she's still very much in play.

50
00:01:44,438 --> 00:01:46,388
I'm serious.

51
00:01:46,390 --> 00:01:49,858
There's only one way I'd let
either of you have sex with her.

52
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:52,778
Not that. It's never that.

53
00:01:53,646 --> 00:01:54,730
I really want this girl

54
00:01:54,732 --> 00:01:56,398
to stay a part
of our lives.

55
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:59,902
So the only way you're allowed
to hook up with her...

56
00:01:59,904 --> 00:02:02,520
is if you marry her.

57
00:02:02,522 --> 00:02:04,957
Too rich for my blood.

58
00:02:06,525 --> 00:02:08,360
That son of a bitch did it.

59
00:02:08,362 --> 00:02:10,662
He really did.

60
00:02:10,664 --> 00:02:12,748
So you're moving
to Chicago tomorrow, huh?

61
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:14,750
How do you feel?

62
00:02:14,752 --> 00:02:16,635
Uh, I'm looking forward to it.

63
00:02:16,637 --> 00:02:18,003
The job's amazing.

64
00:02:18,005 --> 00:02:19,537
I got a great apartment
lined up.

65
00:02:19,539 --> 00:02:21,807
You know, it's...

66
00:02:21,809 --> 00:02:23,508
It's exciting.

67
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:25,543
Onwards and upwar...

00:02:36,426 --> 00:02:40,426

70
00:02:50,588 --> 00:02:54,172
Hey! Bass player.

71
00:02:54,174 --> 00:02:56,908
It's me. The guy from
the drug store with the diapers

72
00:02:56,910 --> 00:02:58,543
that hit on you,
then we went outside

73
00:02:58,545 --> 00:03:01,546
and had a deep, emotional
talk on a bus bench.

74
00:03:01,548 --> 00:03:03,915
I ...I-I'm gonna be really
surprised if I have to be

75
00:03:03,917 --> 00:03:05,183
more specific than that.

76
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:07,019
Remember when you

77
00:03:07,021 --> 00:03:08,420
told me to stop
messing around

78
00:03:08,422 --> 00:03:09,587
and go get the girl?

79
00:03:09,589 --> 00:03:12,274
Well, check it. I got her.

80
00:03:13,978 --> 00:03:16,862
What about you?
You still dating that guy?

81
00:03:24,654 --> 00:03:26,538
Grape Scotch

82
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:28,657
Ted, Ted, Ted, Ted.

83
00:03:28,659 --> 00:03:30,125
Right here, right here,
Yeah,

84
00:03:30,127 --> 00:03:31,710
I-I see you, Barney.
right here, right here.

85
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:33,161
Good, great. Then it's
time to play a little game

86
00:03:33,163 --> 00:03:34,379
I like to call Have...
Yeah,

87
00:03:34,381 --> 00:03:36,298
Barney, I...
No, no.

88
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:38,300
You are not getting out
of Have You Met Ted.

89
00:03:38,302 --> 00:03:39,551
There's a girl
that you have to meet.

90
00:03:39,553 --> 00:03:41,837
She is perfect for you.
And <i>has...</i>

91
00:03:41,839 --> 00:03:43,472
she met you?
No, she <i>has...</i> not.

92
00:03:43,474 --> 00:03:45,724
Think of all the sex
you're gonna <i>ha..</i>

93
00:03:45,726 --> 00:03:47,092
Barney.

94
00:03:48,127 --> 00:03:49,627
I ha... I have to go.

95
00:03:49,629 --> 00:03:51,629
What, now?

96
00:03:53,799 --> 00:03:55,600
Yeah.

97
00:03:58,905 --> 00:04:00,405
Y...

98
00:04:00,407 --> 00:04:02,574
W-We have to do this outside.

99
00:04:09,866 --> 00:04:11,483
Robin.

100
00:04:12,368 --> 00:04:14,169
It's been a major pleasure.

101
00:04:14,171 --> 00:04:16,455
Major Pleasure.
Major Pleasure.

102
00:04:16,457 --> 00:04:18,656
Come here.

103
00:04:21,527 --> 00:04:23,045
Congratulations.

104
00:04:23,047 --> 00:04:24,763
Thank you.

105
00:04:30,669 --> 00:04:33,972
Oh, God, no, this is too real.

106
00:04:33,974 --> 00:04:37,075
I can't handle this,
Marshall's next.

107
00:04:37,077 --> 00:04:39,177
Marshall.

108
00:04:40,897 --> 00:04:43,732
Good luck out there
in Chicago.

109
00:04:43,734 --> 00:04:46,118
I'm gonna be kind of jealous
of you, getting to have

110
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:48,620
Gazzola's pizza
whenever you want.

111
00:04:48,622 --> 00:04:49,821
You're gonna be in Rome.

112
00:04:49,823 --> 00:04:52,791
Yeah. I guess.

113
00:04:59,031 --> 00:05:00,298
I just...

114
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:03,468
I feel like a hug isn't enough.

115
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:05,387
E.T. good-bye?

116
00:05:09,142 --> 00:05:12,894
I'll be right...

117
00:05:12,896 --> 00:05:15,713
here.

118
00:05:15,715 --> 00:05:17,849
Okay, it helped,
but that was really creepy.

119
00:05:17,851 --> 00:05:20,068
I don't want to see you for awhile.

120
00:05:22,271 --> 00:05:24,439
Barney.

121
00:05:25,491 --> 00:05:27,725
Mm.

122
00:05:29,612 --> 00:05:31,129
We licked the Liberty Bell.

123
00:05:31,131 --> 00:05:32,497
We did?

124
00:05:32,499 --> 00:05:34,249
Yeah, you...

125
00:05:34,251 --> 00:05:35,617
You don't remember that?

126
00:05:35,619 --> 00:05:38,253
Uh, I've done
a lot of cool stuff, Ted.

127
00:05:39,422 --> 00:05:42,073
Oh, my God.

128
00:05:42,075 --> 00:05:43,925
I just... I just realized:

129
00:05:43,927 --> 00:05:45,510
Who am I gonna high five now?

130
00:05:45,512 --> 00:05:47,763
Come on, dude.
No, no,

131
00:05:47,765 --> 00:05:49,798
I'm being serious.
What if I see...

132
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:52,517
a pack of lions
fighting a tyrannosaurus?

133
00:05:52,519 --> 00:05:54,052
Or, better yet,

134
00:05:54,054 --> 00:05:55,804
what if I see boobs?

135
00:05:55,806 --> 00:05:57,522
Who am I...
who am I gonna high five then?

136
00:05:57,524 --> 00:05:58,640
You can high
five Marshall.

137
00:05:58,642 --> 00:06:00,058
Yeah, yeah. But Marshall

138
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:02,144
only likes to high five
about Lily boobs.

139
00:06:02,146 --> 00:06:04,062
Oh, always.

140
00:06:04,064 --> 00:06:06,281
Okay, Barney.

141
00:06:06,283 --> 00:06:08,200
I have an idea.

142
00:06:08,202 --> 00:06:10,152
One last high five.

143
00:06:10,154 --> 00:06:13,938
A high five to echo
throughout eternity.

144
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:15,440
Yes.

145
00:06:15,442 --> 00:06:17,075
And within
that high five will be

146
00:06:17,077 --> 00:06:19,294
all the high fives
we've ever high fived.

147
00:06:19,296 --> 00:06:22,414
And all the high fives we
could ever possibly high five.

148
00:06:22,416 --> 00:06:24,382
A high infinity.

149
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:25,917
A high infinity, exactly.

150
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:26,951
Let's do this.

151
00:06:26,953 --> 00:06:28,453
All right,
everybody back up.

152
00:06:28,455 --> 00:06:30,639
Oh, boy.

153
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:35,977
I'll see you
on the other side, Ray.

154
00:06:36,962 --> 00:06:39,147
Nice working with you,
Dr. Venkman.

155
00:06:42,236 --> 00:06:44,236
Aah!

156
00:06:44,970 --> 00:06:47,189
Ow!
Ow!

157
00:06:47,191 --> 00:06:49,641
Oh. Oh.
Oh!

158
00:06:49,643 --> 00:06:50,775
Worth it.

159
00:06:50,777 --> 00:06:52,977
So worth it.

160
00:06:53,979 --> 00:06:56,081
So I rushed out
to make the train,

161
00:06:56,083 --> 00:06:57,999
which is now 45 minutes late.

162
00:06:58,001 --> 00:07:00,485
This lady
with the bass guitar--

163
00:07:00,487 --> 00:07:02,087
was she pretty?

164
00:07:05,592 --> 00:07:07,342
Yeah.

165
00:07:07,344 --> 00:07:08,493
She was beautiful.

166
00:07:08,495 --> 00:07:09,961
Go back and meet her.

167
00:07:09,963 --> 00:07:11,463
No.

168
00:07:11,465 --> 00:07:13,431
But what if it was destiny?

169
00:07:15,852 --> 00:07:19,170
Lady, it's been
a really long weekend.

170
00:07:19,172 --> 00:07:21,973
I'm moving to Chicago tomorrow.

171
00:07:21,975 --> 00:07:24,359
I can't really
talk destiny right now.

172
00:07:24,361 --> 00:07:26,528
Okay.

173
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:35,820
Yes?

174
00:07:35,822 --> 00:07:40,408
What if the universe
sent you a gigantic sign

175
00:07:40,410 --> 00:07:43,578
that this woman
<i>was</i> your destiny?

176
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:45,196
Then would you talk to her?

177
00:07:46,749 --> 00:07:49,501
Yeah, sure. I mean,
I-I guess I would have to.

178
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:50,502
Okay.

179
00:07:50,504 --> 00:07:52,554
Okay.

180
00:07:52,556 --> 00:07:54,038
Where is that train?

181
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:56,675
Can I ask one more question?

182
00:07:56,677 --> 00:07:58,042
What?

183
00:07:58,044 --> 00:08:00,679
This girl with the bass guitar--

184
00:08:00,681 --> 00:08:02,380
is that her?

185
00:08:08,002 --> 00:08:09,686
That <i>is</i> her, isn't it?

186
00:08:09,688 --> 00:08:12,139
This is so exciting.

187
00:08:12,241 --> 00:08:13,574
G-Go talk to her.

188
00:08:13,576 --> 00:08:16,059
All right. Just be cool,
lady. Damn.

189
00:08:16,061 --> 00:08:17,744
Why are you still
sitting here?

190
00:08:17,746 --> 00:08:21,265
Because I'm moving to
Chicago tomorrow, remember?

191
00:08:21,267 --> 00:08:23,000
And 24 hours
from now,

192
00:08:23,002 --> 00:08:26,503
my life is gonna be
completely different.

193
00:08:26,505 --> 00:08:29,423
<i>This is so strange,</i>
<i>you know, now that Ted's</i>

194
00:08:29,425 --> 00:08:33,477
gone, it's just a...
a different vibe.

195
00:08:33,479 --> 00:08:36,963
You can just f-feel
his absence.

196
00:08:36,965 --> 00:08:38,682
Are you kidding me?!

197
00:08:38,684 --> 00:08:39,733
Oh, hey.

198
00:08:39,735 --> 00:08:41,985
Ted, what are
you doing here?

199
00:08:41,987 --> 00:08:43,136
Just having a drink.

200
00:08:43,138 --> 00:08:44,571
What are you doing
in New York?

201
00:08:44,573 --> 00:08:46,106
Aren't you
supposed to be in Chicago?

202
00:08:46,108 --> 00:08:47,741
No... Oh.

203
00:08:47,743 --> 00:08:49,243
Yeah, I'm not doing that.

204
00:08:49,245 --> 00:08:50,644
What?
What?

205
00:08:50,646 --> 00:08:54,164
I'm not moving to Chicago.
Why?

206
00:08:54,166 --> 00:08:55,749
I met a girl.
You...

207
00:08:55,751 --> 00:08:57,201
son of a bitch!

208
00:08:57,203 --> 00:08:58,869
What is the matter with you?

209
00:08:58,871 --> 00:09:00,320
How could you put us
through that?

210
00:09:00,322 --> 00:09:03,290
That good-bye was
emotionally devastating.

211
00:09:03,292 --> 00:09:06,176
A certain delicate flower
cried all night in the shower.

212
00:09:06,178 --> 00:09:08,045
And I was pretty
bummed, too.

213
00:09:08,047 --> 00:09:09,046
And now you're

214
00:09:09,048 --> 00:09:10,547
staying because of some girl?

215
00:09:10,549 --> 00:09:12,716
I mean, who is
this person?

216
00:09:12,718 --> 00:09:14,518
The bass player
from the wedding band.

217
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:15,969
Oh, yeah, she's great.

218
00:09:15,971 --> 00:09:17,104
Love her.
Right,

219
00:09:17,106 --> 00:09:18,672
right?

220
00:09:18,674 --> 00:09:21,108
What are you... What are you doing?
Calling her.

221
00:09:21,110 --> 00:09:23,594
Don't do this.
Don't call her the next day.

222
00:09:23,596 --> 00:09:24,761
You're blowing this.
Huh?

223
00:09:24,763 --> 00:09:26,680
Three days.
You wait three days,

224
00:09:26,682 --> 00:09:27,731
Ted.
Oh, the

225
00:09:27,733 --> 00:09:30,234
three day rule
is-is a childish,

226
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:32,536
manipulative
mind game.

227
00:09:32,538 --> 00:09:34,738
But yeah, you
wait three days.

228
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:38,158
H-Hey, it's Ted. Hi. Um,

229
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:40,877
listen, do you ... do you want
to have dinner tomorrow night?

230
00:09:40,879 --> 00:09:42,362
Great.

231
00:09:42,364 --> 00:09:44,214
It was clear I meant
with me, right?

232
00:09:45,133 --> 00:09:47,668
Same answer. Solid.

233
00:09:48,803 --> 00:09:51,004
Why does he keep
doing this?

234
00:09:51,006 --> 00:09:53,807
He meets 'em,
he likes 'em way too much,

235
00:09:53,809 --> 00:09:56,977
he goes way too big, too soon,
and he ends up blowing it.

236
00:09:56,979 --> 00:09:58,845
I can't take this anymore.

237
00:09:58,847 --> 00:10:01,732
He's fallen in love
so many times now.

238
00:10:03,735 --> 00:10:06,052
Not like this.

239
00:10:06,054 --> 00:10:08,221
This is different.

240
00:10:08,223 --> 00:10:10,557
Come on, go talk to her.

241
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:12,609
Oh, and it'll all be
because of me.

242
00:10:12,611 --> 00:10:15,412
And I'll sing
at your wedding.

243
00:10:15,414 --> 00:10:17,614
Y-You are gonna have
a big wedding, right?

244
00:10:17,616 --> 00:10:20,167
What? No.
Just be cool, lady. Damn.

245
00:10:22,086 --> 00:10:24,904
And aren't big weddings
kind of a young man's game?

246
00:10:24,906 --> 00:10:27,073
You don't have a big wedding
in your 30s.

247
00:10:27,075 --> 00:10:28,959
If I do ever get married,

248
00:10:28,961 --> 00:10:30,677
I'm keeping it simple.

249
00:10:30,679 --> 00:10:32,846
<i>A hot air balloon?</i>

250
00:10:32,848 --> 00:10:35,132
Well, yeah. I mean,
when you're getting married

251
00:10:35,134 --> 00:10:37,601
in a 17th-century castle in
France and making your entrance

252
00:10:37,603 --> 00:10:39,136
on a stagecoach
with six white horses,

253
00:10:39,138 --> 00:10:41,271
you kind of got to make
a big exit.

254
00:10:41,273 --> 00:10:44,391
How much are you
spending on this?

255
00:10:44,393 --> 00:10:46,893
Oh, like, a lot of money.

256
00:10:46,895 --> 00:10:48,278
Mm.
All of my money.

257
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:50,814
Look, I know you guys
have been traveling a lot,

258
00:10:50,816 --> 00:10:52,232
but you're coming, right?

259
00:10:52,234 --> 00:10:54,100
Oh course. What...
Duh.

260
00:10:55,621 --> 00:10:57,103
I'll get the next round.

261
00:10:57,105 --> 00:10:58,155
Thanks.

262
00:10:58,157 --> 00:10:59,289
I'd offer, but...

263
00:10:59,291 --> 00:11:00,407
Castle.

264
00:11:00,409 --> 00:11:03,160
Yeah.

265
00:11:03,162 --> 00:11:04,778
So, how you guys doing?

266
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:06,630
I mean, Robin's really
taking off at work, huh?

267
00:11:06,632 --> 00:11:10,250
It's like, "Robin Scherbatsky,
World Wide News, Caracas."

268
00:11:10,252 --> 00:11:13,086
"Robin Scherbatsky, World Wide
News, St. Petersburg."

269
00:11:13,088 --> 00:11:14,721
"Robin Scherbatsky,
World Wide News,

270
00:11:14,723 --> 00:11:17,174
anywhere but New York,
apparently."

271
00:11:17,176 --> 00:11:18,458
But it's great.

272
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:20,727
Uh, it's makes things
super difficult for us,

273
00:11:20,729 --> 00:11:23,597
but it's great. It's great.

274
00:11:23,599 --> 00:11:26,066
It's great. It's great.

275
00:11:26,068 --> 00:11:27,150
One more and I'll believe you.

276
00:11:27,152 --> 00:11:29,319
It's great.
Sounds great.

277
00:11:29,321 --> 00:11:30,978
Hey.
Hi, hi. Sorry I'm late.

278
00:11:30,979 --> 00:11:32,258
Can I talk to you for a minute?

279
00:11:32,283 --> 00:11:34,643
Yeah, sure. Did you wire the
down payment to the castle guy?

280
00:11:35,143 --> 00:11:36,660
I got a castle guy.

281
00:11:36,662 --> 00:11:39,079
I've got, like,
three castle guys.

282
00:11:39,081 --> 00:11:41,782
And a moat guy, so...

283
00:11:41,784 --> 00:11:44,785
I didn't wire the
payment because

284
00:11:44,787 --> 00:11:48,138
I don't think we can get
married in September.

285
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:50,190
What-What, why?
Because,

286
00:11:50,192 --> 00:11:52,158
when I do get married,

287
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:54,795
I kind of want to fit

288
00:11:54,797 --> 00:11:57,664
in... my dress.

289
00:11:59,050 --> 00:12:00,967
Why wouldn't you f...

290
00:12:01,669 --> 00:12:02,769
No.

291
00:12:02,771 --> 00:12:03,770
Yeah.

292
00:12:03,772 --> 00:12:04,838
No.
Yeah.

293
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:05,839
Yeah, yeah.

294
00:12:05,841 --> 00:12:08,024
Yeah.
Whoa.

295
00:12:09,894 --> 00:12:11,395
What's going on?

296
00:12:11,397 --> 00:12:13,864
She's getting a boob job.

297
00:12:15,182 --> 00:12:17,534
<i>We just peeked in on Penny</i>

298
00:12:17,536 --> 00:12:18,952
asleep in the baby room.

299
00:12:18,954 --> 00:12:20,070
It's adorable.

300
00:12:20,072 --> 00:12:22,456
The whole place
looks great, guys.

301
00:12:22,458 --> 00:12:25,575
But I can't believe you let Ted
hang his jousting lance

302
00:12:25,577 --> 00:12:27,961
from the renaissance fair
on your bedroom wall.

303
00:12:27,963 --> 00:12:29,880
Yeah.

304
00:12:29,882 --> 00:12:31,364
That's Ted's.

305
00:12:32,383 --> 00:12:33,884
So, Marshall, how's your job going?
Mm.

306
00:12:33,886 --> 00:12:36,035
My chair...

307
00:12:36,037 --> 00:12:38,121
is reasonably comfortable.

308
00:12:38,123 --> 00:12:40,390
For short periods of time.

309
00:12:40,392 --> 00:12:42,876
Marshall has decided to say

310
00:12:42,878 --> 00:12:45,679
only positive things about
being back in corporate law.

311
00:12:45,681 --> 00:12:46,713
So you hate it?

312
00:12:46,715 --> 00:12:49,716
Much of what I do does not
make me cry.

313
00:12:49,718 --> 00:12:52,486
But the job's only temporary.

314
00:12:52,488 --> 00:12:55,405
Marshall was offered
the judgeship once,

315
00:12:55,407 --> 00:12:57,157
and he turned it down for me.

316
00:12:57,159 --> 00:12:59,776
So, karmically, that phone
has to ring again.

317
00:12:59,778 --> 00:13:01,695
And even if it doesn't,

318
00:13:01,697 --> 00:13:03,497
today, when my boss

319
00:13:03,499 --> 00:13:06,399
threw his egg salad sandwich
at my face,

320
00:13:06,401 --> 00:13:08,335
some of it got into my mouth.

321
00:13:08,337 --> 00:13:10,337
And it was tasty.

322
00:13:10,339 --> 00:13:12,539
Hey, what
about you guys?

323
00:13:12,541 --> 00:13:14,007
How was Argentina?

324
00:13:15,576 --> 00:13:17,744
Great. It was great.

325
00:13:17,746 --> 00:13:19,095
It was great.
It was great.

326
00:13:19,097 --> 00:13:20,881
It was great.
It <i>was</i> great.

327
00:13:20,883 --> 00:13:23,750
It was great.

328
00:13:23,752 --> 00:13:25,635
One more and I'll
believe you.

329
00:13:26,939 --> 00:13:28,855
This is so not great.

330
00:13:28,857 --> 00:13:31,608
I'm sorry that I have
to work while I'm here.

331
00:13:31,610 --> 00:13:32,977
It's called being on assignment.

332
00:13:33,002 --> 00:13:35,363
Well, what about me? There's
no Wi-Fi in this hotel.

333
00:13:35,364 --> 00:13:37,481
How am I supposed to
run a business, Robin,

334
00:13:37,483 --> 00:13:39,232
with no Wi-Fi?

335
00:13:39,234 --> 00:13:41,451
It's not a business,
Barney, it's a blog, okay?

336
00:13:41,453 --> 00:13:43,370
It is a lifestyle blog.

337
00:13:43,372 --> 00:13:46,490
For the upscale, sophisticated
urban gentleman, and it's

338
00:13:46,492 --> 00:13:50,293
never gonna take off if I can't
post today's boner joke.

339
00:13:53,831 --> 00:13:55,582
I know I'm always traveling.

340
00:13:55,584 --> 00:13:57,918
We both hate it when
I'm gone, we both hate it

341
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:00,720
when I drag you with me.
Neither of us is happy.

342
00:14:02,423 --> 00:14:04,474
Is this just not
working anymore?

343
00:14:04,476 --> 00:14:07,344
Wait, w... What "this"?
This-this?

344
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:11,681
If I gave you an out,
right now--

345
00:14:11,683 --> 00:14:13,900
if there was
an exit ramp right here

346
00:14:13,902 --> 00:14:17,404
at the three-year mark--

347
00:14:17,406 --> 00:14:19,406
would you take it?

348
00:14:20,975 --> 00:14:22,325
Before I answer that,
real quick:

349
00:14:22,327 --> 00:14:24,644
you want to get super drunk
and have sex right now?

350
00:14:24,646 --> 00:14:26,413
Of course.

351
00:14:26,415 --> 00:14:28,915
And then, one thing
led to another.

352
00:14:28,917 --> 00:14:30,483
And then another.

353
00:14:30,485 --> 00:14:31,701
And then another
after that.

354
00:14:31,703 --> 00:14:33,086
Oh.
Oh.

355
00:14:33,088 --> 00:14:35,505
And we kept drinking, and

356
00:14:35,507 --> 00:14:38,124
may have had
a little... too much.

357
00:14:42,797 --> 00:14:44,180
<i>Arigato.</i>

358
00:14:44,182 --> 00:14:45,715
Wow, these rooms
all look the same,

359
00:14:45,717 --> 00:14:47,000
even when you're sober.

360
00:14:47,002 --> 00:14:49,469
You're sober?

361
00:14:51,522 --> 00:14:53,840
So, um...

362
00:14:53,842 --> 00:14:57,444
about what we discussed
last night.

363
00:14:59,013 --> 00:15:01,364
How do you feel?

364
00:15:08,489 --> 00:15:10,624
I love you, Robin.

365
00:15:13,661 --> 00:15:16,246
And when we got married,

366
00:15:16,248 --> 00:15:22,168
I made a vow that I would always
tell you the truth.

367
00:15:23,704 --> 00:15:27,807
We got divorced.

368
00:15:33,498 --> 00:15:36,084
I can't believe you got
divorced without telling us.

369
00:15:36,085 --> 00:15:38,719
This is my mom and
dad all over again.

370
00:15:38,721 --> 00:15:40,938
Barney, if you start
brewing your own beer now

371
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:42,707
and nail my prom
date, so help me...

372
00:15:42,709 --> 00:15:44,275
Years too late on
one of those, Teddy.

373
00:15:44,977 --> 00:15:46,544
Guys, it's okay.

374
00:15:46,546 --> 00:15:48,579
This isn't
a failed marriage.

375
00:15:48,581 --> 00:15:50,231
It's a very
successful marriage

376
00:15:50,233 --> 00:15:52,116
that happened to
only last three years.

377
00:15:52,118 --> 00:15:54,118
You both want this?

378
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:55,953
For real?

379
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:57,955
We do.

380
00:15:57,957 --> 00:15:59,773
For real.

381
00:16:00,542 --> 00:16:03,427
Lily, you okay?

382
00:16:03,429 --> 00:16:04,962
Of course
I'm not okay.

383
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:07,415
This ruins
everything.

384
00:16:07,417 --> 00:16:08,749
Now we have to choose sides,

385
00:16:08,751 --> 00:16:10,885
and obviously
we're gonna choose Robin,

386
00:16:10,887 --> 00:16:12,720
but Barney has his moments.

387
00:16:12,722 --> 00:16:14,221
I really liked

388
00:16:14,223 --> 00:16:15,639
the boner joke of the day.

389
00:16:15,641 --> 00:16:17,975
Look, you guys do not need
to pick sides.

390
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:19,185
Nothing has to change.

391
00:16:19,210 --> 00:16:20,645
No. We've already
broken up before

392
00:16:20,646 --> 00:16:22,680
and we've stayed friends,
remember?

393
00:16:22,682 --> 00:16:26,650
As long as you promise me this
won't mean we stop hanging out.

394
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:28,853
Okay.

395
00:16:28,855 --> 00:16:30,654
I'm serious.
I know, but, I mean,

396
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:32,606
we hardly hang out anymore
anyway.

397
00:16:32,608 --> 00:16:34,641
They live in the suburbs now,

398
00:16:34,643 --> 00:16:36,660
and you two are about
to have baby number three.

399
00:16:38,313 --> 00:16:40,448
Please. You're so obvious.

400
00:16:40,450 --> 00:16:42,983
Your gals are back up
to a full C-cup,

401
00:16:42,985 --> 00:16:45,152
and you've been sipping
her drink all night long.

402
00:16:46,038 --> 00:16:47,588
We didn't want
to announce anything

403
00:16:47,590 --> 00:16:48,956
till we knew for sure.

404
00:16:48,958 --> 00:16:50,341
Oh, my gosh, Lily!

405
00:16:50,343 --> 00:16:51,926
That's amazing!
Oh, congratulations!

406
00:16:51,928 --> 00:16:53,994
Oh, my God.
Wait, see?

407
00:16:53,996 --> 00:16:55,629
This, right here,

408
00:16:55,631 --> 00:16:58,832
this is why we can't fall
out of each other's lives.

409
00:16:58,834 --> 00:17:01,435
We have to be here
for the big moments.

410
00:17:01,437 --> 00:17:03,854
Just promise me,
no matter what,

411
00:17:03,856 --> 00:17:06,690
we will always be there
for the big moments.

412
00:17:06,692 --> 00:17:10,844
I-I promise. We'll-we'll always
be there for the big moments.

413
00:17:11,696 --> 00:17:13,697
Mm.
See?

414
00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:16,517
It's like this whole divorce
thing never happened.

415
00:17:17,787 --> 00:17:18,986
I...

416
00:17:21,656 --> 00:17:23,040
Hey.
Hi, sweetie.

417
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:24,625
How was work?

418
00:17:24,627 --> 00:17:27,828
My-my boss only called me
three words

419
00:17:27,830 --> 00:17:30,498
that meant "vagina" today.

420
00:17:31,299 --> 00:17:33,033
How are the kids?
Asleep.

421
00:17:33,035 --> 00:17:35,169
Good. This is working, right?

422
00:17:35,171 --> 00:17:38,255
Marvin and Daisy sharing a room
together? It's not too cramped?

423
00:17:38,257 --> 00:17:40,257
And then when the
next one arrives,

424
00:17:40,259 --> 00:17:43,227
we'll just put her
crib... in the shower.

425
00:17:43,229 --> 00:17:45,930
It's the perfect size.
It'll save time on cleanups...

426
00:17:45,932 --> 00:17:46,880
Let's move
somewhere bigger.

427
00:17:46,882 --> 00:17:48,849
Yes. Oh, thank God.

428
00:17:48,851 --> 00:17:51,385
I mean... You know,

429
00:17:51,387 --> 00:17:53,887
don't get me wrong.
I love this apartment.

430
00:17:53,889 --> 00:17:56,157
How do you say good-bye
to so many special memories?

431
00:17:56,159 --> 00:17:59,076
Cock-a-mouse!
We have to move!

432
00:18:02,464 --> 00:18:06,000
Hey, Marshall.
Robin!

433
00:18:06,002 --> 00:18:08,335
Hey, I'm so glad you're here.
It's-it's been forever.

434
00:18:08,337 --> 00:18:10,004
Oh, hey.
Hey.

435
00:18:10,006 --> 00:18:11,705
Where's your...
where's your costume?

436
00:18:11,707 --> 00:18:14,291
Oh, uh, it's been
a crazy week at work

437
00:18:14,293 --> 00:18:16,043
so no time to go shopping.

438
00:18:16,045 --> 00:18:18,345
Uh, well, who are
you supposed to be?

439
00:18:18,347 --> 00:18:20,747
Okay, I want to make it clear
this is not my idea.

440
00:18:20,749 --> 00:18:22,550
I'm Captain Ahab.

441
00:18:22,552 --> 00:18:24,802
Why is it bad
if it was your idea?

442
00:18:24,804 --> 00:18:26,887
Robin, you made it!
A white whale. Got it.

443
00:18:26,889 --> 00:18:29,106
Aw. Hi.
Hi.

444
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:30,608
Yeah, I figured,

445
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:33,927
people are thinkin' it. Might as
well steer into the skid, right?

446
00:18:33,929 --> 00:18:35,613
Where's your costume?

447
00:18:35,615 --> 00:18:36,897
Oh, you know,
I've just been so...

448
00:18:36,899 --> 00:18:38,399
Oh, my God, Marshall!

449
00:18:38,401 --> 00:18:40,100
Guess whose digits
I just scored?

450
00:18:40,102 --> 00:18:42,403
The slutty
police officer's...

451
00:18:42,405 --> 00:18:44,738
tax attorney.

452
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:46,273
Hey, Robin!

453
00:18:46,275 --> 00:18:48,075
Hey.
Didn't see you there.

454
00:18:48,077 --> 00:18:50,411
Saved it.

455
00:18:50,413 --> 00:18:51,912
Sorry, I got to pee.

456
00:18:51,914 --> 00:18:54,715
I-I'll be back
in... an hour.

457
00:18:57,969 --> 00:18:59,587
Oh, man.

458
00:18:59,589 --> 00:19:02,173
Is Ted still wearing
his hanging chad costume?

459
00:19:02,175 --> 00:19:04,225
How old is that thing?
It's gone

460
00:19:04,227 --> 00:19:06,960
from played out to
charmingly retro and back

461
00:19:06,962 --> 00:19:08,462
six or seven times now.

462
00:19:08,464 --> 00:19:09,930
Kind of
like Ted himself.

463
00:19:09,932 --> 00:19:12,099
Tonight it's working
for him though.

464
00:19:12,101 --> 00:19:15,769
<i>How do you do this, Ted?</i>
<i>How do you</i>

465
00:19:15,771 --> 00:19:18,155
sit out here all night
on the roof in the cold

466
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:21,058
and still have faith
your pumpkin's gonna show up?

467
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:23,777
Look, I know that odds are
the love of my life

468
00:19:23,779 --> 00:19:25,829
isn't gonna magically walk
through that door

469
00:19:25,831 --> 00:19:27,648
in a pumpkin costume at...

470
00:19:27,650 --> 00:19:30,150
2:43 in the morning, but...

471
00:19:30,152 --> 00:19:33,871
this seems as nice a spot
as any to just, you know...

472
00:19:33,873 --> 00:19:36,473
sit and wait.

473
00:19:43,632 --> 00:19:45,849
Um...

474
00:19:45,851 --> 00:19:48,835
uh, c-can you tell Lily
I-I had to go?

475
00:19:48,837 --> 00:19:50,471
I got to split.

476
00:19:53,975 --> 00:19:55,842
Speaking of splits, do you think
I can do a split in midair

477
00:19:55,844 --> 00:19:57,811
like my boy
David Lee Roth?

478
00:19:57,813 --> 00:19:58,679
I know you can't.

479
00:19:58,681 --> 00:20:00,347
Challenge accepted.

480
00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:08,122
Oh, my scrotum!

481
00:20:15,797 --> 00:20:17,381
I can't get out
of this thing.

482
00:20:17,383 --> 00:20:18,799
I'm holding it.

483
00:20:18,801 --> 00:20:21,001
Wait, are you leaving?
Yeah,

484
00:20:21,003 --> 00:20:23,036
I got a big day tomorrow.
I got to get some sleep.

485
00:20:23,038 --> 00:20:26,056
No, you can't leave.
This is a big moment.

486
00:20:26,058 --> 00:20:28,475
We're saying good-bye
to the apartment.

487
00:20:28,477 --> 00:20:30,844
The whole gang has to be here.

488
00:20:30,846 --> 00:20:32,463
The gang?

489
00:20:32,465 --> 00:20:35,232
Do you know who the gang is
to me, Lily?

490
00:20:35,984 --> 00:20:36,900
Here's what the gang is:

491
00:20:36,902 --> 00:20:39,103
the gang is a married couple

492
00:20:39,105 --> 00:20:42,656
who I never see anymore,
about to have their third kid;

493
00:20:42,658 --> 00:20:44,692
it's my ex-husband,

494
00:20:44,694 --> 00:20:47,745
hitting on slutty cops
right in front of me;

495
00:20:47,747 --> 00:20:51,732
and it's the guy I probably
should have ended up with

496
00:20:51,734 --> 00:20:54,034
with the beautiful mother
of his child.

497
00:20:54,036 --> 00:20:56,287
I mean, who in their right mind
would call

498
00:20:56,289 --> 00:20:58,405
that group of people "the gang"?

499
00:20:58,407 --> 00:21:00,591
Oh...

500
00:21:02,410 --> 00:21:04,928
Oh, oh, so... so what?

501
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:06,597
This is all

502
00:21:06,599 --> 00:21:08,349
just over then?

503
00:21:08,351 --> 00:21:11,802
Our whole friendship
is just over?

504
00:21:11,804 --> 00:21:14,855
No. No, of course not.
Look, we'll...

505
00:21:14,857 --> 00:21:17,608
we'll always be friends.
It's just...

506
00:21:17,610 --> 00:21:20,277
never gonna be how it was.

507
00:21:21,313 --> 00:21:22,596
It can't be.

508
00:21:22,598 --> 00:21:23,814
And that doesn't

509
00:21:23,816 --> 00:21:26,099
have to be a sad thing.

510
00:21:26,101 --> 00:21:28,569
There-There's so much
wonderful stuff happening

511
00:21:28,571 --> 00:21:31,104
in all of our
lives right now.

512
00:21:31,106 --> 00:21:33,407
Look, more than enough
to be grateful for.

513
00:21:34,442 --> 00:21:37,277
But the five of us
hanging out at MacLaren's,

514
00:21:37,279 --> 00:21:39,129
being young and stupid...

515
00:21:39,131 --> 00:21:42,716
that's just not one
of those things.

516
00:21:44,002 --> 00:21:46,053
That part's over.

517
00:21:47,722 --> 00:21:50,391
I got to go.

518
00:21:51,476 --> 00:21:53,560
Good night, Lily.

519
00:21:54,396 --> 00:21:56,897
Good night.

520
00:22:16,118 --> 00:22:17,300
<i>Marshall's almost here.</i>

521
00:22:17,302 --> 00:22:19,219
Yes! Look at us,

522
00:22:19,221 --> 00:22:22,155
hanging out again.
This is amazing.

523
00:22:22,157 --> 00:22:23,623
This is awesome!

524
00:22:23,625 --> 00:22:27,627
This is...
Okay.

525
00:22:27,629 --> 00:22:29,813
Just settle down, buddy.
No!

526
00:22:29,815 --> 00:22:33,433
Settling down is for losers with
kids who never go out anymore.

527
00:22:33,435 --> 00:22:34,568
I am in
charge tonight,

528
00:22:34,570 --> 00:22:37,137
and the earliest
I am allowing anyone

529
00:22:37,139 --> 00:22:39,806
to go home is...
2:00 a.m.

530
00:22:39,808 --> 00:22:41,491
10:00 p.m.
9:45.

531
00:22:41,493 --> 00:22:42,692
3:00 a.m.

532
00:22:42,694 --> 00:22:45,695
Guys, tonight
is gonna be legen--

533
00:22:45,697 --> 00:22:48,448
wait for it...

534
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:49,783
If I leave now,

535
00:22:49,785 --> 00:22:50,867
I could put
the kids to bed.

536
00:22:50,869 --> 00:22:51,868
I'll get the check.

537
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:53,170
..dary!

538
00:22:53,172 --> 00:22:54,754
Legendary!

539
00:22:54,756 --> 00:22:56,873
Guys, the gang is back!

540
00:22:56,875 --> 00:23:00,326
We're back!

541
00:23:00,328 --> 00:23:03,180
All of us except for Robin.

542
00:23:03,965 --> 00:23:05,498
We never see her anymore.

543
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:07,184
Okay, in addition
to you guys not going home

544
00:23:07,186 --> 00:23:09,836
before 4:00 a.m.--
yes, it's up to 4:00 now--

545
00:23:09,838 --> 00:23:13,006
new rule: anytime anyone talks
about something sad,

546
00:23:13,008 --> 00:23:15,275
we stay out an extra hour.

547
00:23:15,277 --> 00:23:17,644
We said we'd always be there
for the big moments.

548
00:23:17,646 --> 00:23:19,396
5:00 a.m.
To be fair,

549
00:23:19,398 --> 00:23:20,847
tonight's just
us hanging out

550
00:23:20,849 --> 00:23:22,315
until 10:00 p.m., tops.

551
00:23:22,317 --> 00:23:23,316
It's not a big moment.

552
00:23:23,318 --> 00:23:24,317
Um,

553
00:23:24,319 --> 00:23:25,869
yes, it is.
Um, no, it's not.

554
00:23:25,871 --> 00:23:29,122
Um, yes, it is.
Um... no, it's not.

555
00:23:29,124 --> 00:23:31,541
Um, yes, it is.

556
00:23:31,543 --> 00:23:33,910
I got a phone call today.

557
00:23:33,912 --> 00:23:37,647
A judge in Queens is retiring,
so...

558
00:23:37,649 --> 00:23:39,483
I'm gonna be a judge.

559
00:23:40,302 --> 00:23:42,469
Yes! Yes!

560
00:23:42,471 --> 00:23:44,971
Judge Eriksen!

561
00:23:44,973 --> 00:23:47,557
Yeah!
 One more.

562
00:23:47,559 --> 00:23:50,877
I told you the phone would
ring. You deserve this.

563
00:23:50,879 --> 00:23:52,395
Thanks, Lily.

564
00:23:52,397 --> 00:23:55,265
- I love you, Marshmallow.
- Oh.

565
00:23:55,267 --> 00:23:56,850
1:45 a.m.

566
00:23:56,852 --> 00:23:59,352
Well, you were right, Barney,
this night was, in fact,

567
00:23:59,354 --> 00:24:01,399
legendary, but...

568
00:24:01,424 --> 00:24:02,690
I know what you're gonna say
and I agree.

569
00:24:02,691 --> 00:24:04,107
We're going to Vegas!

570
00:24:04,109 --> 00:24:05,525
I will be awakened

571
00:24:05,527 --> 00:24:09,696
by screaming children
in less than...

572
00:24:09,698 --> 00:24:12,282
four-and-a-half hours.

573
00:24:12,284 --> 00:24:13,416
You're staying.

574
00:24:13,418 --> 00:24:14,400
I'm going.

575
00:24:14,402 --> 00:24:15,752
Judge Fudge,
your very first ruling?

576
00:24:15,754 --> 00:24:17,170
He stays.

577
00:24:17,172 --> 00:24:18,538
Hey! See?

578
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:20,090
Tonight is about

579
00:24:20,092 --> 00:24:23,376
celebrating our enduring bond
as friends.

580
00:24:23,378 --> 00:24:26,412
Nay, family. Because
that's what we are, Ted.

581
00:24:26,414 --> 00:24:27,631
We are fa...

582
00:24:27,633 --> 00:24:29,015
Okay, fun night,
guys. Keep in touch.

583
00:24:29,017 --> 00:24:30,583
Damn it, Barney.

584
00:24:30,585 --> 00:24:33,436
Crushing... windpipe.

585
00:24:33,438 --> 00:24:35,689
You're lucky that's
the only pipe I'm crushing.

586
00:24:35,691 --> 00:24:38,091
Aah!
That woman is half your age.

587
00:24:38,093 --> 00:24:40,260
Haven't you changed,
even a little?

588
00:24:40,262 --> 00:24:42,362
No. I haven't.

589
00:24:43,147 --> 00:24:45,065
Look, I know
there was a time

590
00:24:45,067 --> 00:24:47,200
when it seemed like I was
capable of going the distance,

591
00:24:47,202 --> 00:24:51,204
but... if it wasn't gonna
happen with Robin,

592
00:24:51,206 --> 00:24:53,707
then it's just not gonna
happen with anyone.

593
00:24:53,709 --> 00:24:54,941
I am never

594
00:24:54,943 --> 00:24:56,826
gonna be a guy
who meets a girl

595
00:24:56,828 --> 00:24:59,129
and, from the first time
I see her, I'm just like,

596
00:24:59,131 --> 00:25:01,831
"You are the
love of my life.

597
00:25:01,833 --> 00:25:03,283
"Everything
I have

598
00:25:03,285 --> 00:25:07,087
and everything I am
is yours forever."

599
00:25:07,089 --> 00:25:08,310
Really?

600
00:25:08,335 --> 00:25:10,414
No, I'm just making a point.
Move it along.

601
00:25:11,292 --> 00:25:13,560
That's not me.

602
00:25:13,562 --> 00:25:15,628
I'm the guy
who straightens his tie,

603
00:25:15,630 --> 00:25:17,347
says something dirty,
high-fives himself

604
00:25:17,349 --> 00:25:19,649
and then goes and talks
to that girl over there.

605
00:25:20,685 --> 00:25:22,335
That's me.

606
00:25:22,337 --> 00:25:26,239
Can I please... just be me?

607
00:25:27,975 --> 00:25:30,110
Judge Fudge?

608
00:25:31,979 --> 00:25:34,331
I'll allow it.

609
00:25:34,333 --> 00:25:37,951
Then I'll a-plow it. Self-five.

610
00:25:37,953 --> 00:25:40,704
Stinson out.

611
00:25:43,175 --> 00:25:46,042
Oh!

612
00:25:46,044 --> 00:25:47,844
Hey, so are you guys

613
00:25:47,846 --> 00:25:49,512
ever gonna tie the knot
or are you...

614
00:25:49,514 --> 00:25:51,681
are you just comfortable
living in sin?

615
00:25:51,683 --> 00:25:52,882
Someone's gotten a bit...

616
00:25:52,884 --> 00:25:54,500
judge-y.
Oh!

617
00:25:54,502 --> 00:25:56,686
- Sustained.
- Yeah.

618
00:25:56,688 --> 00:25:58,521
We'll get around to it.
It's just, you know,

619
00:25:58,523 --> 00:26:00,857
with life and
jobs and kids.

620
00:26:00,859 --> 00:26:02,675
Plus, this one's still
insisting on getting married

621
00:26:02,677 --> 00:26:03,860
in a French castle.

622
00:26:03,862 --> 00:26:06,980
I'd get married tomorrow
in a White Castle,

623
00:26:06,982 --> 00:26:09,849
but this guy needs
more "wow factor."

624
00:26:09,851 --> 00:26:12,152
You're all the wow factor
I need.

625
00:26:12,154 --> 00:26:13,536
Aw!

626
00:26:15,991 --> 00:26:18,484
Glad someone can be happy
on the day of a tragedy.

627
00:26:18,485 --> 00:26:18,955
Aw, Barney,

628
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:20,994
you know this is
all fake, right?

629
00:26:20,996 --> 00:26:22,746
That robot's
not really dead.

630
00:26:22,748 --> 00:26:24,080
I'm not

631
00:26:24,082 --> 00:26:27,133
talking about the robot, Lily.
Everyone,

632
00:26:27,135 --> 00:26:30,870
stop having fun! I'm about
to tell a sad story!

633
00:26:30,872 --> 00:26:35,041
Guys, remember back in 2010
when I achieved a perfect week?

634
00:26:35,043 --> 00:26:37,043
Seven girls in
seven nights, sure.

635
00:26:37,045 --> 00:26:38,478
Well, recently,

636
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:40,263
I decided to attempt...

637
00:26:40,265 --> 00:26:42,332
a perfect month.

638
00:26:42,334 --> 00:26:45,268
<i>I put together</i>
<i>a brand-new playbook.</i>

639
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:48,104
No, I can't hear this.
This is just too sad.

640
00:26:48,106 --> 00:26:50,190
But I haven't gotten
to the sad part yet.

641
00:26:50,192 --> 00:26:52,558
You're in your 40s and
you have a playbook.

642
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:53,559
That's

643
00:26:53,561 --> 00:26:54,611
the sad part.

644
00:26:54,613 --> 00:26:56,780
Lily... just...

645
00:26:56,782 --> 00:26:58,498
Okay?

646
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:01,284
So I put together
a brand-new playbook,

647
00:27:01,286 --> 00:27:04,371
filled with plays
I'd never tried before, like...

648
00:27:05,823 --> 00:27:07,707
<i>...where,</i>
<i>as in the '80s classic,</i>

649
00:27:07,709 --> 00:27:12,095
<i>I magically</i> come <i>to life,</i>
<i>if you know what I mean.</i>

650
00:27:13,531 --> 00:27:16,182
<i>...where I wait till a girl</i>
<i>mentions something she likes.</i>

651
00:27:16,184 --> 00:27:17,917
God, I love nachos.

652
00:27:17,919 --> 00:27:19,969
Thank you.

653
00:27:19,971 --> 00:27:21,554
Allow me to introduce myself.

654
00:27:21,556 --> 00:27:22,772
My name is Jim,

655
00:27:22,774 --> 00:27:24,590
Jim Nacho.

656
00:27:24,592 --> 00:27:28,611
Inventor of the nacho.

657
00:27:28,613 --> 00:27:30,397
So... did you get
a perfect month?

658
00:27:30,399 --> 00:27:32,782
Yes.

659
00:27:32,784 --> 00:27:34,600
Then why are
you so upset?

660
00:27:34,602 --> 00:27:37,070
That last girl, number 31...

661
00:27:37,072 --> 00:27:40,073
Oh, that's a pretty name.
What is that, French?

662
00:27:40,075 --> 00:27:42,492
...she's pregnant.

663
00:27:46,739 --> 00:27:48,255
Wait, you're messing
with us, right?

664
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:50,254
You didn't really
get a girl pregnant?

665
00:27:50,567 --> 00:27:52,174
It's real.

666
00:27:52,199 --> 00:27:53,590
She's pregnant.

667
00:27:55,017 --> 00:27:56,229
Kinda puts an asterisk,

668
00:27:56,254 --> 00:27:58,269
on the whole perfect
month thing, huh?

669
00:27:59,873 --> 00:28:01,824
Barney,
are you okay?

670
00:28:02,709 --> 00:28:05,044
Ah, Jim Nantz.

671
00:28:05,046 --> 00:28:07,914
Thank goodness. You're always
here for me in times of trouble.

672
00:28:07,916 --> 00:28:09,415
What should I do?

673
00:28:09,417 --> 00:28:11,283
You're on your own
this time, bro.

674
00:28:12,586 --> 00:28:14,787
Congratulations, Papa.

675
00:28:14,789 --> 00:28:17,556
Stop it. This is a disaster.

676
00:28:17,558 --> 00:28:18,507
Why?

677
00:28:18,509 --> 00:28:20,793
Why? Because I'm too old.

678
00:28:20,795 --> 00:28:22,061
I was about

679
00:28:22,063 --> 00:28:26,098
to enter my golden years,
my Clooney years,

680
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:28,651
my daddy issues years,

681
00:28:28,653 --> 00:28:31,354
where I don't just remind
messed-up girls of their dads

682
00:28:31,356 --> 00:28:32,822
because I'm emotionally distant.

683
00:28:32,824 --> 00:28:36,259
I freaking look like
their dads. That's the dream.

684
00:28:36,261 --> 00:28:37,293
My life

685
00:28:37,295 --> 00:28:39,612
is over.

686
00:28:39,614 --> 00:28:42,748
So where are you guys
registered?

687
00:28:44,251 --> 00:28:47,586
<i>Another fun fact about the</i>
<i>Goliath National Bank building,</i>

688
00:28:47,588 --> 00:28:50,039
the sleek but historical facade
has been described

689
00:28:50,041 --> 00:28:53,793
by <i>Architecture Vision Monthly</i>
as "modern classicism."

690
00:28:53,795 --> 00:28:55,461
I can see that.

691
00:28:55,463 --> 00:28:57,630
Mm-hmm. Any questions
from the group?

692
00:28:57,632 --> 00:28:58,998
I have a
question.

693
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,933
What happened to the building
that used to be here?

694
00:29:00,935 --> 00:29:02,218
It was way nicer.

695
00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:03,469
Robin!

696
00:29:03,471 --> 00:29:05,271
Oh, my God!

697
00:29:05,273 --> 00:29:07,006
What are you doing here?

698
00:29:07,008 --> 00:29:08,007
I thought you were in...

699
00:29:08,009 --> 00:29:10,559
Greece, uh, Morocco, Moscow.

700
00:29:10,561 --> 00:29:12,728
Yeah, World Wide News
keeps me pretty busy.

701
00:29:12,730 --> 00:29:14,013
And pretty famous.

702
00:29:14,015 --> 00:29:15,314
I mean, you're everywhere.

703
00:29:15,316 --> 00:29:18,017
I am not everywhere. The...

704
00:29:18,902 --> 00:29:20,619
Okay, I'm some places.

705
00:29:20,621 --> 00:29:22,905
Hi, Penny.

706
00:29:22,907 --> 00:29:26,125
Oh, my gosh, I haven't
seen you in forever.

707
00:29:26,127 --> 00:29:28,694
I like you, bus lady.
Oh,

708
00:29:28,696 --> 00:29:29,712
I like you, too.

709
00:29:29,714 --> 00:29:31,196
Never call me that again.

710
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,499
And that was it.

711
00:29:33,501 --> 00:29:35,217
Wow.
Hm.

712
00:29:35,219 --> 00:29:38,754
A genuine Scherbatsky sighting
out in nature.

713
00:29:38,756 --> 00:29:42,174
At this point, that's
like seeing Sasquatch.

714
00:29:42,176 --> 00:29:44,810
No, Sasquatch is a warm
and affectionate creature.

715
00:29:44,812 --> 00:29:46,979
At this point, Robin's
more like the yeti--

716
00:29:46,981 --> 00:29:48,514
cold and aloof.

717
00:29:49,215 --> 00:29:50,850
Hey, Ted.

718
00:29:50,852 --> 00:29:53,152
Ask me if the Abominable
Snowman called.

719
00:29:53,154 --> 00:29:54,987
Has the Abominable Snowman
called?

720
00:29:54,989 --> 00:29:56,388
Not yeti.

721
00:29:57,057 --> 00:29:58,557
Here we are again.

722
00:29:58,559 --> 00:30:02,227
Another big moment for us,
and Robin's missing it.

723
00:30:02,229 --> 00:30:03,696
I know, baby.

724
00:30:03,698 --> 00:30:06,415
I mean, the birth of her
ex-husband's love child

725
00:30:06,417 --> 00:30:09,502
is a bit of a stretch--
but I know, baby.

726
00:30:11,923 --> 00:30:13,672
Well?

727
00:30:13,674 --> 00:30:15,424
It was... crazy in there,

728
00:30:15,426 --> 00:30:16,876
but...

729
00:30:16,878 --> 00:30:19,411
I threw up,
and now I feel better.

730
00:30:19,413 --> 00:30:20,546
Where were you?

731
00:30:20,548 --> 00:30:22,715
In the can.
I knew I was gonna urp,

732
00:30:22,717 --> 00:30:24,717
so I put this on over my suit.

733
00:30:24,719 --> 00:30:26,769
Number 31 won't let me
in the delivery room.

734
00:30:26,771 --> 00:30:28,587
We're gonna need a name
eventually.

735
00:30:28,589 --> 00:30:30,255
Mr. Stinson?

736
00:30:30,257 --> 00:30:32,191
Yes?
Congratulations.

737
00:30:32,193 --> 00:30:33,809
Congratulations because

738
00:30:33,811 --> 00:30:36,445
the blood test came back
and I'm not the father?!

739
00:30:36,447 --> 00:30:38,597
Happy Not a Father's Day!

740
00:30:38,599 --> 00:30:41,700
No. Congratulations.

741
00:30:41,702 --> 00:30:42,818
It's a girl.

742
00:30:42,820 --> 00:30:44,070
Would you like to meet her?

743
00:30:44,072 --> 00:30:45,571
Nah, I'm good.

744
00:30:45,573 --> 00:30:48,240
I don't...
Oh, just go meet your daughter!

745
00:30:49,109 --> 00:30:51,327
This is Ellie.

746
00:31:01,922 --> 00:31:04,423
I'll give you guys
a minute.

747
00:31:17,303 --> 00:31:21,157
You are the love
of my life.

748
00:31:25,746 --> 00:31:29,782
Everything I have...

749
00:31:29,784 --> 00:31:32,785
and everything I am...

750
00:31:34,154 --> 00:31:37,322
...is yours.

751
00:31:39,877 --> 00:31:42,044
Forever.

752
00:31:55,609 --> 00:31:56,809
What?

753
00:31:56,811 --> 00:31:59,145
Do I have stuff in my teeth?

754
00:31:59,147 --> 00:32:00,446
Give me your
engagement ring back.

755
00:32:00,448 --> 00:32:02,681
Just because I have
stuff in my teeth?

756
00:32:02,683 --> 00:32:04,349
We-we can work through this.

757
00:32:04,351 --> 00:32:05,701
Just give it back.

758
00:32:14,527 --> 00:32:18,530
If you don't get married in that
time, you have to re-propose.

759
00:32:18,532 --> 00:32:19,999
Will you...

760
00:32:20,001 --> 00:32:21,550
Yes. Yes, you silly man.

761
00:32:21,552 --> 00:32:22,751
Let me finish.

762
00:32:22,753 --> 00:32:23,819
Will you...

763
00:32:23,821 --> 00:32:25,037
Yes! Sorry.

764
00:32:25,555 --> 00:32:26,338
Yes.

765
00:32:26,340 --> 00:32:28,340
Will y...

766
00:32:28,342 --> 00:32:30,059
Will you marry me...

767
00:32:30,061 --> 00:32:31,727
on Thursday?

768
00:32:31,729 --> 00:32:34,880
I called your office--
you got nothing on Thursday.

769
00:32:34,882 --> 00:32:36,565
Will you marry me on Thursday?

770
00:32:36,567 --> 00:32:37,566
Yes.

771
00:32:45,993 --> 00:32:47,392
Same ring.

772
00:32:49,447 --> 00:32:51,580
<i>I can't believe it.</i>

773
00:32:51,582 --> 00:32:53,899
It's Ted Mosby's wedding day!

774
00:32:53,901 --> 00:32:56,735
Yes! After only seven
years and two kids.

775
00:32:56,737 --> 00:32:58,370
Guys, am I rushing
into this?

776
00:32:58,372 --> 00:32:59,588
Whoa.

777
00:32:59,590 --> 00:33:01,373
Oh, buddy, are you okay?

778
00:33:01,375 --> 00:33:03,759
So tired.

779
00:33:03,761 --> 00:33:05,911
Baby no sleepy.

780
00:33:05,913 --> 00:33:07,846
Barney dying.

781
00:33:07,848 --> 00:33:10,549
Well, we're staying out till
3:00 a.m. tonight.

782
00:33:10,551 --> 00:33:13,068
9:45!

783
00:33:13,070 --> 00:33:16,021
Seriously, though,
I am so proud of you.

784
00:33:16,023 --> 00:33:17,056
Not that
you're a dad.

785
00:33:17,058 --> 00:33:18,557
It's like
you're a totally

786
00:33:18,559 --> 00:33:19,975
different pers...
Whoa!

787
00:33:19,977 --> 00:33:22,228
And... we're back.

788
00:33:23,914 --> 00:33:25,698
Hey.

789
00:33:25,700 --> 00:33:28,067
Hi.
What to join us for shots?

790
00:33:28,069 --> 00:33:29,485
Shots?

791
00:33:29,487 --> 00:33:31,820
Before lunch on a Thursday?

792
00:33:31,822 --> 00:33:34,790
It's like you're <i>trying</i>
to make bad decisions.

793
00:33:34,792 --> 00:33:36,959
You young ladies
need to go home,

794
00:33:36,961 --> 00:33:38,610
put on some
decent clothes

795
00:33:38,612 --> 00:33:41,797
and take a good hard look
at your lives. Get!

796
00:33:42,632 --> 00:33:44,216
Call your parents--

797
00:33:44,218 --> 00:33:45,884
they're probably worried sick.

798
00:33:46,469 --> 00:33:48,921
I have officially

799
00:33:48,923 --> 00:33:51,257
seen everything.

800
00:33:53,343 --> 00:33:55,728
Not everything.

801
00:34:02,834 --> 00:34:05,285
Hi.
Hi.

802
00:34:08,990 --> 00:34:12,476
I-I know I've...
missed a couple lately, but...

803
00:34:12,478 --> 00:34:16,463
we said we'd always be there
for the big moments.

804
00:34:18,349 --> 00:34:20,150
Aw, crap.

805
00:34:20,152 --> 00:34:21,268
Mascara running.

806
00:34:21,270 --> 00:34:23,937
Nobody let her
out of your sight.

807
00:34:26,775 --> 00:34:28,859
Hi, Daddy.
Whoa.

808
00:34:28,861 --> 00:34:30,510
Look, Robin,
I'm really happy to see you,

809
00:34:30,512 --> 00:34:32,362
but I don't think of you
that way anymore.

810
00:34:32,364 --> 00:34:34,181
, dummy,
you had a kid.

811
00:34:34,183 --> 00:34:35,849
Congrats.
Right, yeah.

812
00:34:35,851 --> 00:34:37,618
Thanks. A kid.

813
00:34:37,620 --> 00:34:39,119
I'm tired.

814
00:34:39,121 --> 00:34:40,788
Oh.
But, uh,

815
00:34:40,790 --> 00:34:42,489
she's awesome.
Yeah?

816
00:34:42,491 --> 00:34:43,791
Yeah.

817
00:34:43,793 --> 00:34:45,859
Daddy's home.

818
00:34:48,363 --> 00:34:49,713
Mm.

819
00:34:49,715 --> 00:34:52,532
Judge Fudge? Hey?
 Hey...

820
00:34:52,534 --> 00:34:54,201
Actually, um, little
announcement for everybody.

821
00:34:54,203 --> 00:34:56,369
I'm gonna be running
for State Supreme Court.

822
00:34:56,371 --> 00:34:58,255
Yeah. So if
everything goes well,

823
00:34:58,257 --> 00:35:00,174
in a couple of months,
you won't be calling me

824
00:35:00,176 --> 00:35:01,892
Judge Fudge anymore.

825
00:35:01,894 --> 00:35:04,094
You'll be calling me
Fudge Supreme.

826
00:35:08,516 --> 00:35:10,284
The man of the hour.

827
00:35:10,286 --> 00:35:11,551
Yeah.

828
00:35:11,553 --> 00:35:13,070
You RSVP'd no.

829
00:35:13,072 --> 00:35:14,655
I did.

830
00:35:14,657 --> 00:35:19,392
But someone pretty persuasive
talked me into it.

831
00:35:24,565 --> 00:35:26,450
Sorry. I know
it's bad luck

832
00:35:26,452 --> 00:35:28,669
to see the bride
in her dress.

833
00:35:29,587 --> 00:35:31,371
Worth it.

834
00:35:33,625 --> 00:35:36,210
But I couldn't miss this.

835
00:35:36,212 --> 00:35:37,544
I want to get
a picture.

836
00:35:37,546 --> 00:35:39,930
Get in! I want to take
a picture of you guys.

837
00:35:39,932 --> 00:35:41,765
Come on, get together.

838
00:35:41,767 --> 00:35:43,083
Are you ready?

839
00:35:43,085 --> 00:35:45,269
All right, get in.
All right. All right.

840
00:35:45,271 --> 00:35:47,020
One, two,

841
00:35:47,022 --> 00:35:48,572
three.

842
00:35:56,281 --> 00:35:57,865
Hey. Hey, you kids.

843
00:35:57,867 --> 00:36:00,701
Yeah, you didn't sound
a <i>thousand</i> there.

844
00:36:02,737 --> 00:36:05,122
Do you have any idea
what happened right here

845
00:36:05,124 --> 00:36:06,623
in this very bar?

846
00:36:06,625 --> 00:36:08,408
No. What happened?

847
00:36:09,919 --> 00:36:11,835
Just...

848
00:36:13,922 --> 00:36:17,007
...just all kinds of stuff.

849
00:36:19,511 --> 00:36:20,461
A toast.

850
00:36:20,463 --> 00:36:21,962
Mm-hmm.

851
00:36:21,964 --> 00:36:23,330
Okay, first off...

852
00:36:23,332 --> 00:36:25,432
to everyone at
this table...

853
00:36:26,184 --> 00:36:28,269
...I love you
guys so much,

854
00:36:28,271 --> 00:36:29,470
I can't even...

855
00:36:29,472 --> 00:36:31,355
Just move to the second part.
Okay, okay.

856
00:36:31,357 --> 00:36:33,340
Secondly, to Ted...

857
00:36:33,342 --> 00:36:34,141
Don't say it.

858
00:36:34,143 --> 00:36:36,226
...Evelyn Mosby.

859
00:36:36,228 --> 00:36:37,945
Thank you for that.

860
00:36:37,947 --> 00:36:39,813
A man with...

861
00:36:39,815 --> 00:36:42,283
more emotional endurance

862
00:36:42,285 --> 00:36:44,702
than anyone I know.

863
00:36:44,704 --> 00:36:45,852
It was a long,

864
00:36:45,854 --> 00:36:48,122
difficult road.

865
00:36:48,124 --> 00:36:50,824
Thank God we
finally got here.

866
00:36:50,826 --> 00:36:51,792
Hear, hear.

867
00:36:51,794 --> 00:36:53,043
Hear, hear.

868
00:36:53,045 --> 00:36:54,578
<i>Aunt Lily wasn't wrong.</i>

869
00:36:54,580 --> 00:36:57,881
<i>It was at times</i>
<i>a long, difficult road.</i>

870
00:36:57,883 --> 00:36:59,967
<i>But I'm glad it was</i>
<i>long and difficult,</i>

871
00:36:59,969 --> 00:37:03,304
<i>because if I hadn't gone</i>
<i>through hell to get there,</i>

872
00:37:03,306 --> 00:37:04,972
<i>the lesson might</i>
<i>not have been as clear.</i>

873
00:37:04,974 --> 00:37:07,891
<i>You see, kids,</i>
<i>right from the moment</i>

874
00:37:07,893 --> 00:37:09,827
<i>I met your mom, I knew...</i>

875
00:37:09,829 --> 00:37:12,563
<i>I have to love this woman</i>
<i>as much as I can</i>

876
00:37:12,565 --> 00:37:15,933
<i>for as long as I can, and</i>
<i>I can never stop loving her,</i>

877
00:37:15,935 --> 00:37:17,568
<i>not even for a second.</i>

878
00:37:17,570 --> 00:37:20,988
<i>I carried that lesson with me</i>
<i>through every</i>

879
00:37:20,990 --> 00:37:23,273
<i>stupid fight we ever had,</i>

880
00:37:23,275 --> 00:37:26,026
<i>every 5:00 a.m.</i>
<i>Christmas morning,</i>

881
00:37:26,028 --> 00:37:28,679
<i>every sleepy Sunday afternoon,</i>

882
00:37:28,681 --> 00:37:29,947
<i>through every speed bump.</i>

883
00:37:29,949 --> 00:37:31,248
<i>Every pang of jealousy</i>

884
00:37:31,250 --> 00:37:34,702
<i>or boredom or uncertainty</i>
<i>that came our way,</i>

885
00:37:34,704 --> 00:37:37,254
<i>I carried that lesson with me.</i>

886
00:37:37,256 --> 00:37:39,923
<i>And I carried it with me</i>
<i>when she got sick.</i>

887
00:37:39,925 --> 00:37:44,345
<i>Even then, in what can only</i>
<i>be called the worst of times,</i>

888
00:37:44,347 --> 00:37:47,114
<i>all I could do was look at her</i>
<i>and thank God,</i>

889
00:37:47,116 --> 00:37:51,802
<i>thank every god there is,</i>

890
00:37:51,804 --> 00:37:53,303
<i>and the whole universe,</i>

891
00:37:53,305 --> 00:37:56,724
<i>and anyone else</i>
<i>I can possibly thank...</i>

892
00:37:56,726 --> 00:37:58,609
? Will I see you tonight?

893
00:37:58,611 --> 00:38:01,395
<i>...that I saw</i>
<i>that beautiful girl</i>

894
00:38:01,397 --> 00:38:03,614
<i>on that train platform,</i>

895
00:38:03,616 --> 00:38:06,400

<i>tap her on the shoulder,</i>

897
00:38:10,322 --> 00:38:12,239

898
00:38:12,241 --> 00:38:14,408
<i>and speak.</i>

899
00:38:14,410 --> 00:38:16,243
Excuse me. Hi.
Hi.

900
00:38:16,245 --> 00:38:17,995
I'm the...
The best man. Yeah. Get in here,

901
00:38:17,997 --> 00:38:20,164
get in here, get in here.
Oh, thanks. Here, let me.

902
00:38:20,166 --> 00:38:21,548
Oh, okay. Thank you.

903
00:38:21,550 --> 00:38:24,084
Great show tonight. Yeah.
Oh, thank you.

904
00:38:24,086 --> 00:38:26,053
You're Cindy's
ex-roommate, right?

905
00:38:26,055 --> 00:38:28,455
Yeah. And you are the professor.

906
00:38:28,457 --> 00:38:31,058
I took one of your classes.

907
00:38:31,060 --> 00:38:32,959
Really? Which one?
Mm-hmm.

908
00:38:32,961 --> 00:38:34,228
Econ 305.

909
00:38:34,230 --> 00:38:36,430
Econ 305.
I don't teach...

910
00:38:36,432 --> 00:38:37,631
Oh, no.

911
00:38:37,633 --> 00:38:39,016
Oh, yeah.

912
00:38:39,018 --> 00:38:41,151
Excuse me, I'm gonna jump
onto the tracks now. - No.

913
00:38:41,153 --> 00:38:43,854
No, no, no, don't.
You were great, you were great.

914
00:38:43,856 --> 00:38:45,522
Wait a second.

915
00:38:45,524 --> 00:38:47,491
This is my umbrella.

916
00:38:47,493 --> 00:38:51,478
I left this umbrella at Cindy's--
you totally stole my umbrella.

917
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:52,813
What? No, I didn't.

918
00:38:52,815 --> 00:38:55,165
This is my umbrella.
I bought this.

919
00:38:55,167 --> 00:38:57,701
Excuse me. It even
has my initials

920
00:38:57,703 --> 00:38:59,486
on it right here: T.M.

921
00:38:59,488 --> 00:39:00,754
Ted Mosby.

922
00:39:00,756 --> 00:39:02,823
Yeah. Look again,
Ted Mosby.

923
00:39:02,825 --> 00:39:05,209
Those are my
T.M.

924
00:39:05,211 --> 00:39:08,262
Tracy McConnell.
Um, no, Tracy McConnell,

925
00:39:08,264 --> 00:39:10,997
it's T.M.--
Totally My umbrella.

926
00:39:10,999 --> 00:39:13,350
Uh, your T.M.--
Terribly Mistaken,

927
00:39:13,352 --> 00:39:16,720
because this umbrella has
always belonged T.M.:

928
00:39:16,722 --> 00:39:18,939
To Me.

929
00:39:20,309 --> 00:39:24,228
Although... I did lose it
for a few years there.

930
00:39:24,230 --> 00:39:27,114
Um... so, I went to
this dance club...

931
00:39:27,116 --> 00:39:28,365
On St. Patrick's Day.

932
00:39:28,367 --> 00:39:31,485
...on St. Patrick's Day.

933
00:39:31,487 --> 00:39:33,036
And you left it there.

934
00:39:33,038 --> 00:39:35,038
And I left it there.

935
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:37,858
And you never thought
you'd see it again.

936
00:39:37,860 --> 00:39:40,494
And I never thought
I'd see it again.

937
00:39:44,048 --> 00:39:46,633
Funny how sometimes you just...

938
00:39:46,635 --> 00:39:48,218
find things.

939
00:39:48,220 --> 00:39:52,890
? Will I see you tonight?

940
00:39:52,892 --> 00:39:54,308
Hi.

941
00:39:54,310 --> 00:39:55,425
Hi.

942
00:39:58,380 --> 00:40:00,314
? Every night

943
00:40:00,316 --> 00:40:02,516
? It's just the same ?

944
00:40:04,486 --> 00:40:08,956
? All upon a downtown train.

945
00:40:10,241 --> 00:40:11,992
And that, kids...

946
00:40:11,994 --> 00:40:14,778
is how I met your mother.

947
00:40:14,780 --> 00:40:16,763
That's it?

948
00:40:16,765 --> 00:40:18,782
That's it.

949
00:40:18,784 --> 00:40:20,717
No. I don't buy it.

950
00:40:20,719 --> 00:40:23,387
That is not the reason
you made us listen to this.

951
00:40:23,389 --> 00:40:24,855
Oh, really?

952
00:40:24,857 --> 00:40:27,157
Then what's the reason?

953
00:40:27,159 --> 00:40:28,742
Let's look at
the facts here.

954
00:40:28,744 --> 00:40:30,328
You made us sit down
and listen to this story

955
00:40:30,353 --> 00:40:32,330
about how you met mom.

956
00:40:32,331 --> 00:40:35,465
Yet mom's hardly
in the story. No.

957
00:40:35,467 --> 00:40:37,267
This is a story
about how

958
00:40:37,269 --> 00:40:38,819
you're totally in love
with Aunt Robin.

959
00:40:38,821 --> 00:40:40,387
And you're thinking
about asking her out,

960
00:40:40,389 --> 00:40:42,589
and you want to know
if we're okay with it.

961
00:40:42,591 --> 00:40:43,924
I can't believe this.

962
00:40:43,926 --> 00:40:47,694
I kept this story short
and to the point,

963
00:40:47,696 --> 00:40:49,596
and you guys still missed it.

964
00:40:49,598 --> 00:40:51,932
The point of the story
is that...

965
00:40:51,934 --> 00:40:54,935
Is that you totally, totally, totally
have the hots for Aunt Robin.

966
00:40:54,937 --> 00:40:55,619
No, I don't.

967
00:40:55,621 --> 00:40:57,154
Yes, you do.

968
00:40:57,156 --> 00:40:58,572
You're grounded.

969
00:40:58,574 --> 00:40:59,990
Wow, you are really
into Aunt Robin.

970
00:40:59,992 --> 00:41:01,074
You're grounded, too.

971
00:41:02,493 --> 00:41:06,463
Okay, suppose I <i>were</i> interested
in Aunt Robin in that way--

972
00:41:06,465 --> 00:41:08,549
it's not like
I'd do anything about it.

973
00:41:08,551 --> 00:41:10,784
I got you guys to think about.
My gosh,

974
00:41:10,786 --> 00:41:12,085
we <i>love</i> Aunt Robin.

975
00:41:12,087 --> 00:41:14,054
Whenever she comes over
for dinner, you guys

976
00:41:14,056 --> 00:41:15,973
are so obvious.

977
00:41:15,975 --> 00:41:17,074
Come on, Dad.

978
00:41:17,076 --> 00:41:19,860
Mom's been gone
for six years now.

979
00:41:19,862 --> 00:41:21,678
It's time.

980
00:41:22,981 --> 00:41:25,816
What, I just...
just call her up on the phone

981
00:41:25,818 --> 00:41:28,101
and ask her out on a date?

982
00:41:28,103 --> 00:41:29,403
Yes.
Yes.

983
00:41:29,405 --> 00:41:31,154
And that... that's something

984
00:41:31,156 --> 00:41:32,356
you guys would want?

985
00:41:32,358 --> 00:41:33,824
Yes!
Yes!

986
00:41:39,180 --> 00:41:41,481
All right, I'll give her a call.

987
00:41:41,483 --> 00:41:43,066
Do it.
I am.

988
00:41:43,068 --> 00:41:44,985
Call her.
I'm <i>calling</i> her.

989
00:41:44,987 --> 00:41:46,003
Great.

990
00:41:46,005 --> 00:41:48,321
Here I go.

991
00:41:51,125 --> 00:41:52,943
Or...

992
00:41:56,347 --> 00:41:58,632
All right, home sweet home.

993
00:41:58,634 --> 00:42:01,385
Oh. Wait one second.

994
00:42:01,387 --> 00:42:02,853
Okay.

995
00:42:02,855 --> 00:42:05,689
Stay.

996
00:42:05,691 --> 00:42:07,007
We'll work on that.

997
00:42:08,727 --> 00:42:11,695
Television, display
front door security.

998
00:42:11,697 --> 00:42:13,730
Television, dis...

999
00:42:13,732 --> 00:42:14,848
Oh, for Pete's sakes.

1000
00:42:14,850 --> 00:42:17,017
? May come and go

1001
00:42:17,019 --> 00:42:20,353
? Our crooked dreams

1002
00:42:20,355 --> 00:42:23,373
? Will always flow

1003
00:42:23,375 --> 00:42:24,408
