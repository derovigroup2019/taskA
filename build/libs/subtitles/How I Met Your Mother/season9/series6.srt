1
00:00:01,135 --> 00:00:02,281
TED:
<i>Look at this,</i>

2
00:00:02,282 --> 00:00:04,248
your wedding weekend.
I know.

3
00:00:04,301 --> 00:00:06,552
This close to finally
having sex again.

4
00:00:06,554 --> 00:00:07,987
It's been forever.

5
00:00:07,989 --> 00:00:09,522
Oh, you and Robin
been abstaining?

6
00:00:09,524 --> 00:00:10,489
Talking about you, Ted.

7
00:00:10,491 --> 00:00:12,641
Now here's the deal:
every hookup

8
00:00:12,643 --> 00:00:15,477
at a weekend wedding is decided
at Friday night drinks.

9
00:00:15,479 --> 00:00:17,113
Get stuck with
the wrong girl

10
00:00:17,115 --> 00:00:19,481
tonight, the only action you'll
be getting all weekend

11
00:00:19,483 --> 00:00:22,151
is a self-five,
and I don't mean the cool kind.

12
00:00:22,153 --> 00:00:24,704
(chuckles)
Self-five! That's the cool kind.

13
00:00:24,706 --> 00:00:26,172
Well, that's a big decision.

14
00:00:26,174 --> 00:00:28,124
The biggest.

15
00:00:28,126 --> 00:00:31,460
It brings to mind
that religious text

16
00:00:31,462 --> 00:00:33,512
which we hold most sacred:

17
00:00:33,514 --> 00:00:36,983
<i>Indiana Jones and</i>
<i>the Last Crusade.</i>

18
00:00:36,985 --> 00:00:39,685
Remember?
They entered a chamber.

19
00:00:39,687 --> 00:00:42,504
Really? I'm the one working
with the Nazis?

20
00:00:42,506 --> 00:00:45,725
Ted, just... just... okay?

21
00:00:45,727 --> 00:00:48,010
Yeah.
They had to choose

22
00:00:48,012 --> 00:00:50,345
which cup was
this special cup.

23
00:00:50,347 --> 00:00:51,864
I forget what
it was called,

24
00:00:51,866 --> 00:00:53,699
but it's like the
Holy Grail of cups.

25
00:00:53,701 --> 00:00:56,535
It was the Holy Grail.
Of cups, exactly.

26
00:00:56,537 --> 00:00:59,705
So the Nazi confederate
chose, and...

27
00:00:59,707 --> 00:01:01,991
(quietly):
Please don't make me do that...

28
00:01:01,993 --> 00:01:04,460
Ted, Ted, the confederate
Nazi chose, and...? - I...

29
00:01:04,462 --> 00:01:06,045
Okay, okay.

30
00:01:06,047 --> 00:01:07,696
Oh.

31
00:01:12,419 --> 00:01:13,869
And so now I'm gonna explode.

32
00:01:13,871 --> 00:01:15,254
(explosion sounds)

33
00:01:15,256 --> 00:01:17,006
He chose...

34
00:01:17,008 --> 00:01:18,474
poorly.

35
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:22,561
Then Indy picked
a cup, and...

36
00:01:26,549 --> 00:01:28,317
You chose...

37
00:01:28,319 --> 00:01:29,718
wisely.

38
00:01:32,639 --> 00:01:34,640
(playing surf guitar)

39
00:01:36,676 --> 00:01:38,060
So choose wisely, Ted.

40
00:01:38,062 --> 00:01:41,113
To help you decide,
I spent all day yesterday

41
00:01:41,115 --> 00:01:42,531
picking your top
three prospects.

42
00:01:42,533 --> 00:01:43,616
And I helped.

43
00:01:43,618 --> 00:01:45,701
It was either that
or writing our vows.

44
00:01:45,703 --> 00:01:46,752
Uch! Gag.

45
00:01:46,754 --> 00:01:50,039
Sophia was Robin's
college roommate,

46
00:01:50,041 --> 00:01:53,092
and she's apparently "a bit
of a screamer" in the sack.

47
00:01:53,094 --> 00:01:54,409
Yeah, mid-sex,

48
00:01:54,411 --> 00:01:56,679
she sounds exactly like
a car alarm from the '90s.

49
00:01:56,681 --> 00:02:01,767
You know, whoo-whoo-whoo-whoo,
ooh-uh, ooh, ah-ah-ah-ah.

50
00:02:01,769 --> 00:02:03,418
Dudes love it.

51
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:06,522
Cassie is the daughter
of my mom's best friend.

52
00:02:06,524 --> 00:02:09,809
Sad story: 12 years ago,
her gymnast career

53
00:02:09,811 --> 00:02:13,963
was tragically cut short
when her boobs got too big.

54
00:02:14,981 --> 00:02:16,265
Grace is a new coworker.

55
00:02:16,267 --> 00:02:19,285
She's had six different
positions at the firm,

56
00:02:19,287 --> 00:02:21,403
and that was just at
the Christmas party.

57
00:02:21,405 --> 00:02:22,655
Ooh.

58
00:02:22,657 --> 00:02:24,573
So, Grace doesn't arrive till later,
Mm-hmm.

59
00:02:24,575 --> 00:02:27,159
I recommend
(whistles) Sophia.

60
00:02:27,161 --> 00:02:31,914
I strongly feel that you
should strongly feel her.

61
00:02:31,916 --> 00:02:33,916
I guess it's decided, then.

62
00:02:33,918 --> 00:02:35,701
Ted, right?
Yeah.

63
00:02:35,703 --> 00:02:37,336
I'm Cassie.

64
00:02:37,338 --> 00:02:39,588
Oh... something tells me

65
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:42,975
that we are gonna have a lot
of fun this weekend. (chuckles)

66
00:02:45,178 --> 00:02:47,062
(quietly):
Cassie. I pick Cassie.

67
00:02:49,983 --> 00:02:52,134
You chose...

68
00:02:52,136 --> 00:02:54,103
poorly.

69
00:02:56,145 --> 00:03:00,145

71
00:03:08,869 --> 00:03:10,319
Hey, there's our minister.

72
00:03:10,321 --> 00:03:12,588
Oh, what a sweet-looking old...

73
00:03:13,456 --> 00:03:15,624
Ah! He looks scary.

74
00:03:15,626 --> 00:03:16,992
Looks can be
deceiving, Lily.

75
00:03:16,994 --> 00:03:18,327
But not in this case.

76
00:03:18,329 --> 00:03:19,795
He's a mean old tool.

77
00:03:21,398 --> 00:03:24,383
Oh, he can't be that bad.

78
00:03:24,385 --> 00:03:26,685
I'll get him to come around.
Just...

79
00:03:28,004 --> 00:03:29,605
Hi, Reverend,

80
00:03:29,607 --> 00:03:32,141
I'm Lily Aldrin,
the maid of honor.

81
00:03:32,143 --> 00:03:33,809
Not too much honor.

82
00:03:33,811 --> 00:03:36,045
You're dressed like a whore.

83
00:03:37,647 --> 00:03:39,448
(mouthing)

84
00:03:41,535 --> 00:03:43,669
So what's going on?
Why aren't you telling your wife

85
00:03:43,671 --> 00:03:45,004
you got an offer to be a judge?

86
00:03:45,006 --> 00:03:47,506
Lily had her heart set
on us moving to Rome,

87
00:03:47,508 --> 00:03:49,341
so I have to tell her in person.

88
00:03:49,343 --> 00:03:51,627
That way, I know that I can
convince her

89
00:03:51,629 --> 00:03:53,229
that we need to stay.

90
00:03:53,231 --> 00:03:56,582
In the courtroom,
they call me The Convincer.

91
00:03:56,584 --> 00:03:58,500
They really call you that?

92
00:03:58,502 --> 00:04:01,587
I convinced them
to call me that.

93
00:04:01,589 --> 00:04:03,272
But you have to prepare
for your court cases.

94
00:04:03,274 --> 00:04:05,641
Did you prepare
for talking to Lily?

95
00:04:05,643 --> 00:04:06,909
I don't need to prepare, okay?

96
00:04:06,911 --> 00:04:09,545
I can craft a nice...

97
00:04:09,547 --> 00:04:11,080
thingy.

98
00:04:12,349 --> 00:04:14,133
Oh, wow I'm totally...

99
00:04:14,135 --> 00:04:15,601
the twisty metal thingy?

100
00:04:15,603 --> 00:04:16,518
You're screwed.

101
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:18,103
I'm screwed!

102
00:04:18,105 --> 00:04:19,688
(both laughing)

103
00:04:19,690 --> 00:04:21,723
I'm sorry, Ted, I don't know.

104
00:04:21,725 --> 00:04:23,859
I'm just so tired
of this routine:

105
00:04:23,861 --> 00:04:25,727
we flirt, we have a few drinks,

106
00:04:25,729 --> 00:04:28,080
and then we end the night
with meaningless sex.

107
00:04:28,082 --> 00:04:30,199
Oh...

108
00:04:30,201 --> 00:04:32,334
yeah.

109
00:04:32,336 --> 00:04:33,919
Me, too.

110
00:04:33,921 --> 00:04:36,338
Do you want to start the night
with meaningless sex

111
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:37,623
and then flirt later?

112
00:04:37,625 --> 00:04:38,907
You are a visionary.

113
00:04:38,909 --> 00:04:40,326
(laughs)

114
00:04:40,328 --> 00:04:41,327
Come on.

115
00:04:41,329 --> 00:04:42,344
(phone rings)

116
00:04:42,346 --> 00:04:44,630
Oh! Oh! It's work.

117
00:04:44,632 --> 00:04:46,749
Should I get it or ignore it?

118
00:04:46,751 --> 00:04:48,583
Or get it? Oh, or ignore it?

119
00:04:48,585 --> 00:04:49,885
Um...
Forget it?

120
00:04:49,887 --> 00:04:51,270
You know? Go ahead, get it.

121
00:04:51,272 --> 00:04:52,688
Okay. (clears throat)

122
00:04:52,690 --> 00:04:54,223
Hello?

123
00:04:55,225 --> 00:04:57,092
You chose...

124
00:04:57,094 --> 00:04:58,327
poorly.

125
00:04:58,329 --> 00:05:00,579
I'm fired?

126
00:05:00,581 --> 00:05:02,481
But teaching there
was my dream job!

127
00:05:02,483 --> 00:05:04,566
And you guys
are my only friends.

128
00:05:04,568 --> 00:05:07,602
You all hate me?

129
00:05:07,604 --> 00:05:09,989
Can I at least say
good-bye to all my kids?

130
00:05:09,991 --> 00:05:13,492
My kids all hate me?!

131
00:05:13,494 --> 00:05:14,994
(sobbing)

132
00:05:14,996 --> 00:05:16,195
Oh!

133
00:05:16,197 --> 00:05:18,998
Oh. It's okay.

134
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:23,669
So, what were we
about to do?

135
00:05:23,671 --> 00:05:26,005
I think it was
"meaningless" something?

136
00:05:26,007 --> 00:05:27,423
Meaningless socks? No.

137
00:05:27,425 --> 00:05:28,490
(sobbing)

138
00:05:28,492 --> 00:05:30,242
No, it wasn't
meaningless socks.

139
00:05:30,244 --> 00:05:32,344
Hey, hi, hi, hi.

140
00:05:32,346 --> 00:05:34,229
Um, so, a little problem.

141
00:05:34,231 --> 00:05:38,267
I was trying really hard
not to offend your minister...

142
00:05:38,269 --> 00:05:42,187
So how did you
and your husband meet?

143
00:05:42,189 --> 00:05:45,024
Oh, it was our first week
of college.

144
00:05:45,026 --> 00:05:47,493
<i>I needed help hooking up</i>
<i>my stereo,</i>

145
00:05:47,495 --> 00:05:51,030
<i>so I walked down the hall,</i>
<i>and I just knew</i>

146
00:05:51,032 --> 00:05:52,581
<i>I should knock</i>
<i>on this one door.</i>

147
00:05:52,583 --> 00:05:54,583
<i>Marshall opened it.</i>

148
00:05:54,585 --> 00:05:55,934
<i>It was destiny.</i>

149
00:05:55,936 --> 00:05:57,953
Hi.
Hi.

150
00:05:57,955 --> 00:06:00,673
We've been together ever since.

151
00:06:01,558 --> 00:06:03,175
Excuse me!

152
00:06:04,294 --> 00:06:06,095
What did I do wrong?

153
00:06:06,829 --> 00:06:09,348
What did <i>you</i> do wrong?

154
00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:12,051
We really wanted him
to marry us.

155
00:06:12,053 --> 00:06:14,353
His church has cute
coming out the wazoo,

156
00:06:14,355 --> 00:06:16,505
but when we met with him...

157
00:06:16,507 --> 00:06:18,340
No pets in my church.

158
00:06:18,342 --> 00:06:20,926
No casual attire in my church.

159
00:06:20,928 --> 00:06:24,013
No gum.
No sports logos...

160
00:06:24,015 --> 00:06:25,881
Reverend?
More like Never-end.

161
00:06:25,883 --> 00:06:28,567
Prayer-five.
No shouting. No cell phones.

162
00:06:28,569 --> 00:06:29,618
I'll warn you

163
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:32,855
that I turn down
most wedding requests.

164
00:06:32,857 --> 00:06:36,425
Particularly from boozy,
promiscuous Manhattanites

165
00:06:36,427 --> 00:06:38,911
who only want me
to marry them because

166
00:06:38,913 --> 00:06:43,248
my church has "cute
coming out the wazoo."

167
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:46,502
That is the total
opposite of us.

168
00:06:46,504 --> 00:06:49,054
People are like that?

169
00:06:49,056 --> 00:06:50,622
Well, then,
how did you two meet?

170
00:06:50,624 --> 00:06:53,642
Oh, um, um...

171
00:06:53,644 --> 00:06:54,709
Um...

172
00:06:54,711 --> 00:06:57,146
Uh, we've been...
dating since college.

173
00:06:57,148 --> 00:06:59,848
We met the
very first week.

174
00:06:59,850 --> 00:07:02,368
<i>I needed help</i>
<i>hooking up my stereo,</i>

175
00:07:02,370 --> 00:07:05,687
<i>so I walked down the hall,</i>
<i>and I just knew</i>

176
00:07:05,689 --> 00:07:07,740
<i>that I should knock</i>

177
00:07:07,742 --> 00:07:09,575
BARNEY:
<i>I opened the door.</i>

178
00:07:09,577 --> 00:07:11,110
<i>And it was destiny.</i>

179
00:07:13,413 --> 00:07:14,763
Hi.

180
00:07:14,765 --> 00:07:16,448
Hi.

181
00:07:16,450 --> 00:07:18,733
BOTH:
We've been together ever since!

182
00:07:18,735 --> 00:07:21,069
You stole our story
of how we met?!

183
00:07:21,071 --> 00:07:23,539
We had to! Your story is so sweet!
Mm.

184
00:07:23,541 --> 00:07:25,407
You didn't even kiss
till the third date.

185
00:07:25,409 --> 00:07:27,242
By our third date,
I'd hit more bases

186
00:07:27,244 --> 00:07:29,945
than Bob Hope on a USO tour.
Topical.

187
00:07:29,947 --> 00:07:32,247
Now Reverend Lowell
knows that we lied to him.

188
00:07:32,249 --> 00:07:34,500
What if he cancels
our wedding?

189
00:07:34,502 --> 00:07:36,218
What? That's ridiculous.

190
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:37,519
Barney, Robin,
I need to speak

191
00:07:37,521 --> 00:07:39,555
with you in private immediately.

192
00:07:40,890 --> 00:07:42,274
And it's not just
losing my job,

193
00:07:42,276 --> 00:07:45,694
my car just got stolen
with all my stuff in it.

194
00:07:45,696 --> 00:07:47,629
And now I think
I'm getting the flu!

195
00:07:47,631 --> 00:07:49,431
I'm sorry.

196
00:07:49,433 --> 00:07:51,567
I've been talking
for, like, a half an hour.

197
00:07:51,569 --> 00:07:53,752
It's fine.
40 minutes. It's fine.

198
00:07:53,754 --> 00:07:56,538
Still, I think I would be able
to handle all of this

199
00:07:56,540 --> 00:08:01,577
(voice breaks): if my boyfriend Wesley
hadn't just broken up with me!

200
00:08:01,579 --> 00:08:03,796
(sobs softly)

201
00:08:05,948 --> 00:08:07,583
(inhales deeply)

202
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:12,621
Why don't you tell me about it?

203
00:08:12,623 --> 00:08:15,507
Okay! I should go back
to the beginning.

204
00:08:15,509 --> 00:08:17,176
Oh, no, before the beginning.

205
00:08:17,178 --> 00:08:18,560
Winter, 1998...

206
00:08:18,562 --> 00:08:20,128
<i>Man, this girl is a drag!</i>

207
00:08:20,130 --> 00:08:24,233
If I hurry, I bet I still have
<i>a shot with Sophia.</i>

208
00:08:24,235 --> 00:08:26,768
<i>Okay, I'll get one more drink</i>
<i>with Cassie, then bail.</i>

209
00:08:26,770 --> 00:08:28,353
But where, bar or dining room?

210
00:08:28,355 --> 00:08:30,606
<i>Bar or dining room?</i>

211
00:08:30,608 --> 00:08:32,858
For my fourth date
with Wesley, we went...

212
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:36,028
Cassie, let's get one more drink
in the dining room.

213
00:08:36,030 --> 00:08:37,880
You chose...

214
00:08:39,866 --> 00:08:41,033
Hi, Mom! Hi, Dad!

215
00:08:41,035 --> 00:08:43,118
Hey! We just ordered
appetizers.

216
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,253
Sit down, you two!

217
00:08:45,288 --> 00:08:47,623
...Ha-poorly!

218
00:08:50,344 --> 00:08:53,017
Marshall, you're walking into
the biggest fight of your life.

219
00:08:53,018 --> 00:08:55,602
You have to be prepared.
You have to be tough.

220
00:08:55,604 --> 00:08:57,220
I am tough!
No, you're not.

221
00:08:57,222 --> 00:08:58,388
You make some good points.

222
00:08:58,390 --> 00:09:00,257
Now, what exactly
are you gonna say to Lily

223
00:09:00,259 --> 00:09:01,524
when you walk
through that door?

224
00:09:01,526 --> 00:09:03,143
Okay.

225
00:09:03,145 --> 00:09:04,344
Hey, baby.

226
00:09:04,346 --> 00:09:05,862
So, listen,
I got this phone call...

227
00:09:05,864 --> 00:09:07,330
DAPHNE:
<i>Whoa, whoa, whoa!</i>

228
00:09:07,332 --> 00:09:08,565
You haven't seen her in a week.

229
00:09:08,567 --> 00:09:10,901
Where's the "I missed you"?
How about a kiss?

230
00:09:10,903 --> 00:09:12,786
Nothing about her new hairstyle?

231
00:09:12,788 --> 00:09:14,237
Hairstyle?
I can't actually see...

232
00:09:14,239 --> 00:09:15,322
Start over!

233
00:09:15,873 --> 00:09:17,774
Lily! Hi.

234
00:09:17,776 --> 00:09:19,042
Mmm.

235
00:09:19,044 --> 00:09:20,043
I missed you.

236
00:09:20,045 --> 00:09:22,462
And your hairstyle so much.

237
00:09:22,464 --> 00:09:23,713
DAPHNE'S VOICE:
I missed you, too.

238
00:09:23,715 --> 00:09:27,150
I can't wait to show you
how much in bed tonight.

239
00:09:27,152 --> 00:09:28,418
Okay, that's creepy.

240
00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:29,552
Don't break character.

241
00:09:29,554 --> 00:09:31,137
Okay, um...

242
00:09:31,139 --> 00:09:33,957
So, listen, I got this
phone call last week, and I...

243
00:09:33,959 --> 00:09:35,342
DAPHNE:
<i>Whoa, whoa, whoa!</i>

244
00:09:35,344 --> 00:09:37,177
Acknowledge her own views
on the matter first.

245
00:09:37,179 --> 00:09:38,595
Start over.

246
00:09:39,363 --> 00:09:40,847
Lily, hi, mwah.

247
00:09:40,849 --> 00:09:42,315
I missed you
and your hairstyle so much.

248
00:09:42,317 --> 00:09:43,800
DAPHNE'S VOICE:
I missed you, too.

249
00:09:43,802 --> 00:09:46,670
Okay, so, I know
that you're excited for Rome.

250
00:09:46,672 --> 00:09:48,521
I'm more excited
for bed tonight.

251
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:53,109
While I was away,
uh, I got a phone call.

252
00:09:53,111 --> 00:09:54,828
To be a judge.

253
00:09:54,830 --> 00:09:56,012
What the damn hell?!

254
00:09:56,014 --> 00:09:57,146
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

255
00:09:57,148 --> 00:09:59,332
Lily does not say
"What the damn hell."

256
00:09:59,334 --> 00:10:00,917
Well, I've never met her
but, yes, she does.

257
00:10:00,919 --> 00:10:02,585
You make some good points.
Wow.

258
00:10:02,587 --> 00:10:04,387
You are terrible at this.

259
00:10:05,339 --> 00:10:06,823
(sighs)
Why did we lie?

260
00:10:06,825 --> 00:10:08,291
We have to come clean.

261
00:10:08,293 --> 00:10:10,944
Frankly,
I am appalled.

262
00:10:10,946 --> 00:10:12,345
I know. I...
Your friend

263
00:10:12,347 --> 00:10:15,899
Lily just tried to pass off
your sweet story

264
00:10:15,901 --> 00:10:18,852
of how you met as her own.

265
00:10:19,971 --> 00:10:22,639
That lying little tart!
I am horrified and relieved!

266
00:10:22,641 --> 00:10:26,609
Does Lily have any... problems
that you're aware of?

267
00:10:26,611 --> 00:10:27,861
Drinking.
Drugs.

268
00:10:27,863 --> 00:10:31,180
BOTH:
She's been drinking drugs.

269
00:10:31,182 --> 00:10:32,449
LOWELL:
<i>Well,</i>

270
00:10:32,451 --> 00:10:34,350
I talked to Barney
and Robin,

271
00:10:34,352 --> 00:10:36,369
and, let me say, I'm shocked.

272
00:10:36,371 --> 00:10:37,871
You should be.

273
00:10:37,873 --> 00:10:39,656
Flat-out lying to me like that?

274
00:10:39,658 --> 00:10:41,755
We are not misunderstanding
each other.

275
00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:45,263
How dare you pretend their
beautiful story is actually your own.

276
00:10:45,363 --> 00:10:47,047
Come again for Lil' Fudge?
(chuckles)

277
00:10:47,049 --> 00:10:48,465
I understand the temptation.

278
00:10:48,467 --> 00:10:50,366
They're such a sweet couple.

279
00:10:50,368 --> 00:10:51,885
I mean, the way
they call each other

280
00:10:51,887 --> 00:10:54,387
Barnmallow and Robinpad.

281
00:10:54,389 --> 00:10:56,706
(chuckles)
Oh.

282
00:10:56,708 --> 00:10:58,374
LILY:
Yes.

283
00:10:58,376 --> 00:11:00,677
I do steal
their stories.

284
00:11:00,679 --> 00:11:02,395
Mm-hmm.
But only because

285
00:11:02,397 --> 00:11:03,763
my husband and I

286
00:11:03,765 --> 00:11:06,883
are so ashamed
of how we met.

287
00:11:06,885 --> 00:11:09,853
<i>See, we only met</i>
<i>because his friend Ted</i>

288
00:11:09,855 --> 00:11:11,187
<i>fell in love with me.</i>

289
00:11:11,189 --> 00:11:12,906
<i>And who could blame him?</i>

290
00:11:12,908 --> 00:11:14,107
Hey, Marshall.

291
00:11:14,109 --> 00:11:15,275
See that girl?

292
00:11:15,277 --> 00:11:16,693
Oh, yeah.

293
00:11:16,695 --> 00:11:18,578
You just know
she likes it dirty.

294
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:19,896
Go say hi.
What?

295
00:11:19,898 --> 00:11:21,934
I can't just go say hi.
I-I need a plan.

296
00:11:21,935 --> 00:11:22,443
Hmm.

297
00:11:22,468 --> 00:11:23,834
I'm gonna wait until
she goes to the bathroom...

298
00:11:23,835 --> 00:11:24,834
Hi.

299
00:11:24,836 --> 00:11:26,536
Have you met Ted?

300
00:11:26,538 --> 00:11:28,071
MARSHALL:
I'm sorry,

301
00:11:28,073 --> 00:11:30,090
I can't...

302
00:11:30,092 --> 00:11:31,591
LILY:
And now, after years of lying,

303
00:11:31,593 --> 00:11:32,909
<i>cheating and backsliding,</i>

304
00:11:32,911 --> 00:11:34,227
<i>here we are, married!</i>

305
00:11:34,229 --> 00:11:35,962
But what can I say?

306
00:11:35,964 --> 00:11:37,797
My husband's a sociopath

307
00:11:37,799 --> 00:11:39,265
who's slept with over
a hundred women,

308
00:11:39,267 --> 00:11:42,552
and I'm a slut who once let
my boss feel me up.

309
00:11:42,554 --> 00:11:43,603
Oh, come on!

310
00:11:43,605 --> 00:11:45,555
I felt <i>him</i> up!
It is over 250 women!

311
00:11:45,557 --> 00:11:47,857
If you two want to get married
in my church,

312
00:11:47,859 --> 00:11:49,926
you'll stop breaking
the ninth commandment.

313
00:11:49,928 --> 00:11:51,644
Uh...
no fat chicks?

314
00:11:51,646 --> 00:11:53,146
Thou shalt not lie!

315
00:11:53,148 --> 00:11:55,431
With fat chicks?

316
00:11:55,433 --> 00:11:57,817
You're killing me.
You're killing me.

317
00:11:57,819 --> 00:11:58,952
Now that...

318
00:11:58,954 --> 00:12:00,436
was a good dessert.
(Cassie sighs)

319
00:12:00,438 --> 00:12:03,289
"Dessert" sounds like "desert."

320
00:12:03,291 --> 00:12:06,776
The desert
has sand...

321
00:12:06,778 --> 00:12:08,812
there's sand
at the beach...

322
00:12:08,814 --> 00:12:10,880
and Wesley and I

323
00:12:10,882 --> 00:12:13,049
once drove by a beach.

324
00:12:13,051 --> 00:12:14,050
(sobbing)

325
00:12:14,052 --> 00:12:15,952
Excuse me.

326
00:12:15,954 --> 00:12:18,004
(sobbing)

327
00:12:18,006 --> 00:12:19,789
TED:
<i>Now's my chance to leave.</i>

328
00:12:19,791 --> 00:12:21,257
No, I'll wait five more seconds

329
00:12:21,259 --> 00:12:22,675
<i>so I don't seem too eager.</i>

330
00:12:22,677 --> 00:12:23,643
<i>Four...</i>

331
00:12:23,645 --> 00:12:24,677
<i>three...</i>

332
00:12:24,679 --> 00:12:25,812
<i>two...</i>

333
00:12:25,814 --> 00:12:27,730
Well, thanks for keeping
our daughter company.

334
00:12:27,732 --> 00:12:29,132
Man, she can be
a real drag, huh?

335
00:12:29,134 --> 00:12:32,318
We're gonna go have
a little fun. See ya!

336
00:12:33,571 --> 00:12:34,904
(laughing)

337
00:12:34,906 --> 00:12:37,657
You're on fire tonight, bro.

338
00:12:38,742 --> 00:12:41,027
But, Lily, being a judge
is my dream job.

339
00:12:41,029 --> 00:12:42,529
DAPHNE'S VOICE:
So your dream job

340
00:12:42,531 --> 00:12:44,114
is more important
than my dream job?

341
00:12:44,116 --> 00:12:46,116
Exactly.
Now you're getting it.

342
00:12:46,118 --> 00:12:47,534
(clucks tongue)
Nope.

343
00:12:47,536 --> 00:12:48,551
Start over.

344
00:12:48,553 --> 00:12:50,036
So your dream job's

345
00:12:50,038 --> 00:12:51,838
more important
than my dream job?

346
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:54,541
But, baby, you already have
the best job in the world:

347
00:12:54,543 --> 00:12:56,009
Mom.
Nope.

348
00:12:56,011 --> 00:12:57,076
Start over.

349
00:12:57,078 --> 00:12:58,962
So your dream job's
more important

350
00:12:58,964 --> 00:13:00,096
than my dream job?

351
00:13:00,098 --> 00:13:03,166
Hey, I gave up peeing
in the shower for you.

352
00:13:03,168 --> 00:13:04,184
Nope.

353
00:13:04,186 --> 00:13:05,218
Start over.

354
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:06,553
So your dream job's

355
00:13:06,555 --> 00:13:08,388
more important
than my dream job?

356
00:13:08,390 --> 00:13:09,505
Of course not.

357
00:13:09,507 --> 00:13:10,740
But this isn't

358
00:13:10,742 --> 00:13:12,475
just about our future.

359
00:13:12,477 --> 00:13:14,060
It's about everyone's.

360
00:13:14,062 --> 00:13:15,061
As a lawyer,

361
00:13:15,063 --> 00:13:16,729
I couldn't stop big oil
from polluting,

362
00:13:16,731 --> 00:13:18,231
but as a judge...

363
00:13:18,233 --> 00:13:19,482
well, maybe I can.

364
00:13:19,484 --> 00:13:21,284
And that's why I took the job.

365
00:13:22,019 --> 00:13:23,186
You've just been "convincered."

366
00:13:23,188 --> 00:13:24,487
Wait.

367
00:13:24,489 --> 00:13:26,372
You already took the job?

368
00:13:26,374 --> 00:13:28,158
Without even talking
to your wife?

369
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:29,859
Start over.

370
00:13:29,861 --> 00:13:31,244
Start over... start over.

371
00:13:31,246 --> 00:13:33,213
What the damn hell?!

372
00:13:34,748 --> 00:13:36,299
Hi, Reverend
Lowell?

373
00:13:36,301 --> 00:13:38,301
Whew.
Made it through my half.

374
00:13:38,303 --> 00:13:39,869
You're up.

375
00:13:39,871 --> 00:13:41,054
Oh. Uh...

376
00:13:41,056 --> 00:13:43,289
The-the truth is,
we-we have

377
00:13:43,291 --> 00:13:45,141
a complicated,
messy history

378
00:13:45,143 --> 00:13:46,726
that-that we're
not too proud of.

379
00:13:46,728 --> 00:13:48,011
But...

380
00:13:48,013 --> 00:13:49,345
we're sorry
that we lied,

381
00:13:49,347 --> 00:13:52,999
and hope that
you can forgive us.

382
00:13:55,936 --> 00:13:57,904
Nope, I can't do it.

383
00:13:57,906 --> 00:13:59,939
You're going to have
to find a new officiant.

384
00:13:59,941 --> 00:14:01,224
Okay.

385
00:14:01,226 --> 00:14:02,325
Well, these
things happen.

386
00:14:02,327 --> 00:14:03,359
And a new church.

387
00:14:03,361 --> 00:14:05,828
What the damn hell?!

388
00:14:06,780 --> 00:14:09,749
TED: <i>This evening could not</i>
<i>get any worse.</i>

389
00:14:09,751 --> 00:14:11,618
Whenever you're ready.
Crap!

390
00:14:13,721 --> 00:14:14,871
Hey, Ted.

391
00:14:14,873 --> 00:14:16,589
Thanks for
being so great.

392
00:14:16,591 --> 00:14:18,608
I'm lucky to have you
around this weekend.

393
00:14:18,610 --> 00:14:20,593
Ooh, yeah...

394
00:14:20,595 --> 00:14:22,095
About that...

395
00:14:22,097 --> 00:14:25,014
I should really go see
about the, uh...

396
00:14:25,016 --> 00:14:26,883
So, sex?
My room is very close.

397
00:14:26,885 --> 00:14:28,635
(Cassie laughs)

398
00:14:28,637 --> 00:14:29,903
TED:
Sophia. Hi.

399
00:14:29,905 --> 00:14:31,221
Oh, God. Wesley.

400
00:14:31,223 --> 00:14:33,523
Wait. Wait, you're Wesley?

401
00:14:33,525 --> 00:14:35,058
Hey, Cassie.
(laughs nervously)

402
00:14:35,060 --> 00:14:37,260
Your parents were just saying
you have a new boyfriend.

403
00:14:37,262 --> 00:14:39,646
"Boyfriend" is
a little premature.

404
00:14:39,648 --> 00:14:40,980
Though I did
pay for dinner.

405
00:14:40,982 --> 00:14:43,432
Ted and I are
very happy.

406
00:14:43,434 --> 00:14:44,784
Are we?

407
00:14:44,786 --> 00:14:48,071
(crying): Even if... he'll
never replace you.

408
00:14:48,073 --> 00:14:50,456
(sobbing)

409
00:14:52,509 --> 00:14:53,826
So, Sophia. Hi.

410
00:14:53,828 --> 00:14:54,844
I'm Ted.

411
00:14:54,846 --> 00:14:56,713
Robin's friend.

412
00:14:56,715 --> 00:14:58,447
What do you say we give
these two old flames

413
00:14:58,449 --> 00:15:00,383
a chance to...
catch up alone,

414
00:15:00,385 --> 00:15:01,968
and maybe you and I
could go get a drink.

415
00:15:01,970 --> 00:15:03,386
Are you hitting on me?
Dude!

416
00:15:03,388 --> 00:15:04,671
Ted, let's go!

417
00:15:08,642 --> 00:15:10,877
You tip...

418
00:15:10,879 --> 00:15:12,061
(scoffs)

419
00:15:12,063 --> 00:15:13,680
...poorly.

420
00:15:17,704 --> 00:15:20,012
Look, I know. I shouldn't
have taken the job

421
00:15:20,013 --> 00:15:21,095
without telling Lily.

422
00:15:21,097 --> 00:15:22,847
Why are you so ticked off
about it?

423
00:15:22,849 --> 00:15:25,016
Because I know
what she's going through.

424
00:15:25,018 --> 00:15:26,067
I always dreamed

425
00:15:26,069 --> 00:15:28,620
of having a career
I could be proud of,

426
00:15:28,622 --> 00:15:30,705
but my husband never
supported me.

427
00:15:30,707 --> 00:15:31,890
Eventually,

428
00:15:31,892 --> 00:15:34,676
I had to... make a choice.

429
00:15:34,678 --> 00:15:35,743
Now, every day,

430
00:15:35,745 --> 00:15:36,961
I'm out there,

431
00:15:36,963 --> 00:15:39,130
I'm fighting for the good guys,
and I love it.

432
00:15:39,132 --> 00:15:40,398
Doesn't

433
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:41,916
your wife deserve th, too?

434
00:15:41,918 --> 00:15:46,004
Wow. Um, maybe
you're right.

435
00:15:46,006 --> 00:15:49,340
I didn't realize how many
sacrifices you'd made.

436
00:15:50,359 --> 00:15:51,976
What is it you do, anyway?

437
00:15:51,978 --> 00:15:53,761
I'm a lobbyist
for a big oil company.

438
00:15:53,763 --> 00:15:55,379
What the damn hell?!

439
00:15:57,382 --> 00:15:58,733
You know
that I'm an environmentalist!

440
00:15:58,735 --> 00:16:00,384
That's why you don't want me
to become a judge.

441
00:16:00,386 --> 00:16:02,219
But you're the reason
I <i>have</i> to become a judge!

442
00:16:02,221 --> 00:16:04,689
You're the devil incarnate!
And outcarnate!

443
00:16:04,691 --> 00:16:06,891
Every kind of carnate!

444
00:16:08,460 --> 00:16:09,644
Please, is-is there

445
00:16:09,646 --> 00:16:10,878
any way you'd reconsider?

446
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:12,580
No! No, no!

447
00:16:12,582 --> 00:16:14,749
You two are both
terrible people.

448
00:16:14,751 --> 00:16:17,819
Who found each other
in this crazy world!

449
00:16:17,821 --> 00:16:19,170
Aw!

450
00:16:19,172 --> 00:16:21,739
And who lie
about <i>how</i> they found each other.

451
00:16:21,741 --> 00:16:23,958
So, please leave now. Just...

452
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:26,044
Ugh! Ugh!

453
00:16:26,046 --> 00:16:28,346
You know what?
You're right.

454
00:16:28,348 --> 00:16:30,748
We shouldn't have lied
about our story.

455
00:16:31,433 --> 00:16:32,850
I <i>love</i> our story.

456
00:16:32,852 --> 00:16:34,802
Sure, it's messy,
but it's the story

457
00:16:34,804 --> 00:16:37,188
that got us here,
about to get married.

458
00:16:37,190 --> 00:16:39,524
I love it, too.

459
00:16:39,526 --> 00:16:41,492
Every messy chapter.

460
00:16:41,494 --> 00:16:43,978
I love that you slept
with over 250 women

461
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:46,114
before deciding that
I was your favorite.

462
00:16:46,116 --> 00:16:47,282
This is killing me.

463
00:16:47,284 --> 00:16:48,833
And I love
that we just had

464
00:16:48,835 --> 00:16:50,434
to keep having sex
with each other,

465
00:16:50,436 --> 00:16:51,903
even when we were dating
other people.

466
00:16:51,905 --> 00:16:53,437
This is <i>really</i> killing me.

467
00:16:53,439 --> 00:16:55,106
And I love that your
marriage proposal

468
00:16:55,108 --> 00:16:57,208
involved a strip
club, lying to me,

469
00:16:57,210 --> 00:17:01,095
and pretending to bang the
woman I <i>hate</i> for two months.

470
00:17:01,097 --> 00:17:02,664
I love that we keep
a running tally

471
00:17:02,666 --> 00:17:04,248
of all the different rooms
we've had sex in.

472
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:07,502
I love that two weeks ago, we
put this room on that list.

473
00:17:07,504 --> 00:17:09,420
Huh? Come on, Rev.

474
00:17:09,422 --> 00:17:11,622
That's got to be worth
some kind of reaction, right?

475
00:17:11,624 --> 00:17:13,858
I mean, right where
your hymnal is, is where we...

476
00:17:13,860 --> 00:17:16,010
we...

477
00:17:17,896 --> 00:17:20,064
(laughs)

478
00:17:30,242 --> 00:17:33,494
Well, that's not what you want.

479
00:17:33,496 --> 00:17:36,664
(crying and kissing)

480
00:17:36,666 --> 00:17:38,750
(crying, sniffling,
kissing)

481
00:17:38,752 --> 00:17:40,651
Um, are...
are you okay?

482
00:17:40,653 --> 00:17:43,955
I think... think maybe seeing
your ex was a bit much for you.

483
00:17:43,957 --> 00:17:46,174
No. Not at all.

484
00:17:46,176 --> 00:17:48,176
I want... only you.

485
00:17:48,178 --> 00:17:49,927
Oh, yeah.

486
00:17:49,929 --> 00:17:53,097
I want to...
I want to rock your world.

487
00:17:53,099 --> 00:17:55,433
And you're so hot.
(sniffling)

488
00:17:55,435 --> 00:17:59,137
I want to ride you
like a bronco.

489
00:17:59,139 --> 00:18:01,422
(sobbing)
Okay, Cassie. Cassie.

490
00:18:01,424 --> 00:18:03,507
Yeah, we...
we can't do this.

491
00:18:03,509 --> 00:18:04,809
I mean, you're crying.

492
00:18:04,811 --> 00:18:06,060
(coughing)

493
00:18:06,062 --> 00:18:07,445
And contagious.

494
00:18:07,447 --> 00:18:08,780
You're-you're having

495
00:18:08,782 --> 00:18:10,148
a really, really bad week.

496
00:18:10,150 --> 00:18:12,150
I think... I think
you should just

497
00:18:12,152 --> 00:18:14,752
take it easy.

498
00:18:14,754 --> 00:18:15,870
You're right.

499
00:18:15,872 --> 00:18:18,373
I'm not in a good place.
No.

500
00:18:18,375 --> 00:18:19,457
Oh, wow.

501
00:18:19,459 --> 00:18:21,459
I probably would have
let you do

502
00:18:21,461 --> 00:18:24,195
all sorts of crazy things to me.

503
00:18:24,197 --> 00:18:26,381
(sighs)

504
00:18:27,549 --> 00:18:29,300
Exactly.

505
00:18:29,302 --> 00:18:31,335
I release you.

506
00:18:31,337 --> 00:18:33,638
Go have fun this weekend.

507
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:35,223
Meet someone else.

508
00:18:35,225 --> 00:18:37,058
TED: <i>Yes! Yes! Be cool.</i>
Okay.

509
00:18:37,060 --> 00:18:39,060
NARRATOR: <i>But I couldn't</i>
<i>meet someone else.</i>

510
00:18:39,062 --> 00:18:41,062
Hey, Ted?
Yeah.

511
00:18:41,064 --> 00:18:42,213
Everyone here is saying

512
00:18:42,215 --> 00:18:44,515
you and Cassie are the
couple of the weekend.

513
00:18:44,517 --> 00:18:45,850
How great is that?

514
00:18:45,852 --> 00:18:47,735
NARRATOR:
<i>Barney was right.</i>

515
00:18:47,737 --> 00:18:50,605
<i>I'd chosen poorly,</i>
<i>everyone had seen us together,</i>

516
00:18:50,607 --> 00:18:52,723
<i>and now the whole weekend</i>
<i>seemed lost.</i>

517
00:18:52,725 --> 00:18:55,159
<i>Until...</i>

518
00:18:55,161 --> 00:18:57,561
Hi. I just got here.

519
00:18:57,563 --> 00:18:59,447
Did I miss anything?

520
00:18:59,449 --> 00:19:02,417
Not at all. Grace, right?

521
00:19:02,419 --> 00:19:05,620
I'm Ted. Let's get you a drink
before you talk to anyone else

522
00:19:05,622 --> 00:19:07,839
or hear anything.

523
00:19:09,174 --> 00:19:10,858
Hey, guys.
How's your night going?

524
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:12,176
Ugh!
Ugh!

525
00:19:12,178 --> 00:19:13,928
Our minister just died.

526
00:19:13,930 --> 00:19:15,913
Wh...?
We can still use the church,

527
00:19:15,915 --> 00:19:17,765
but we only have two days
to find a new officiant.

528
00:19:17,767 --> 00:19:19,133
Unless...

529
00:19:19,243 --> 00:19:20,334
BARNEY:
Wedding at Bernie's!

530
00:19:20,335 --> 00:19:21,835
We're not doing
Wedding at Bernie's!

531
00:19:21,837 --> 00:19:24,754
Wow. Oh, that's terrible.

532
00:19:24,756 --> 00:19:26,723
Should I make a toast
in his honor?

533
00:19:26,725 --> 00:19:28,308
(whispers):
No.

534
00:19:28,310 --> 00:19:29,726
Of course I should.

535
00:19:30,678 --> 00:19:32,128
Everyone?

536
00:19:32,130 --> 00:19:33,763
To Reverend Lowell.

537
00:19:33,765 --> 00:19:35,732
He may have
passed away

538
00:19:35,734 --> 00:19:37,133
tonight, but
he will always...

539
00:19:37,135 --> 00:19:39,169
Uncle Robert died?!

540
00:19:39,987 --> 00:19:41,571
Oh, no.

541
00:19:41,573 --> 00:19:43,907
(crying)

542
00:19:46,878 --> 00:19:48,811
(high-pitched crying)

543
00:19:48,813 --> 00:19:50,030
(sobbing)

544
00:19:50,032 --> 00:19:51,832
Have a nice weekend.

545
00:19:51,834 --> 00:19:54,784
NARRATOR: <i>All that night, I did nothing</i>
<i>but choose poorly.</i>

546
00:19:54,786 --> 00:19:56,169
<i>But thanks to Cassie,</i>

547
00:19:56,171 --> 00:19:58,722
<i>I didn't get together</i>
<i>with anyone at that wedding.</i>

548
00:19:58,724 --> 00:20:00,040
<i>And if I had,</i>

549
00:20:00,042 --> 00:20:04,127
<i>well, then, your mother</i>
<i>and I might never have met.</i>

550
00:20:04,129 --> 00:20:07,997
<i>So, maybe, in a way,</i>
<i>I chose wisely.</i>

551
00:20:08,712 --> 00:20:11,692
SOPHIA:
Boo-uh! Boo-uh! Eee!

552
00:20:11,693 --> 00:20:13,526
<i>Although, it sure as heck</i>

553
00:20:13,528 --> 00:20:14,745
<i>didn't feel like it</i>
<i>at the time.</i>

554
00:20:14,746 --> 00:20:16,029
Aah! Aah! Aah!

555
00:20:16,031 --> 00:20:17,664
(sighs)

556
00:20:17,666 --> 00:20:19,532
She chose...

557
00:20:19,534 --> 00:20:20,917
Wesley.

558
00:20:20,919 --> 00:20:22,285
(chuckling)

559
00:20:22,287 --> 00:20:24,838
I've been dying
to say that one all night.

560
00:20:26,657 --> 00:20:28,625
Look, I'm sorry
I yelled at you.

561
00:20:28,627 --> 00:20:29,992
The truth is, you're right.

562
00:20:29,994 --> 00:20:32,829
It was wrong of me to take
that job without telling Lily.

563
00:20:32,831 --> 00:20:35,799
I don't need to be tough
with her. I need to be fair.

564
00:20:35,801 --> 00:20:37,434
Thanks, Marshall.
Mm.

565
00:20:37,436 --> 00:20:39,552
I should also apologize.

566
00:20:39,554 --> 00:20:41,771
While you were filling the tank,

567
00:20:41,773 --> 00:20:44,357
I may have been so angry,

568
00:20:44,359 --> 00:20:47,544
I texted your wife with the news

569
00:20:47,546 --> 00:20:50,213
that you took that judge offer.

570
00:20:50,215 --> 00:20:52,032
(phone ringing)

571
00:20:52,034 --> 00:20:53,950
Don't forget
to compliment her hair.

572
