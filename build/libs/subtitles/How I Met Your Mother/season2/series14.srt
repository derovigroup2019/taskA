1
00:00:01,835 --> 00:00:04,703
Kids, I've told you stories
about all the big holidays:

2
00:00:04,705 --> 00:00:06,705
<i>Christmas...</i>

3
00:00:06,707 --> 00:00:08,307
<i>Halloween...</i>

4
00:00:08,309 --> 00:00:11,377
<i>Thanksgiving...</i>

5
00:00:11,379 --> 00:00:15,347
But one holiday was always
my favorite... super bowl Sunday.

6
00:00:15,349 --> 00:00:18,317
And there was one super bowl
back in 2007

7
00:00:18,319 --> 00:00:20,119
<i>That I will never forget.</i>

8
00:00:20,121 --> 00:00:21,353
Marshall, you're on beer detail.

9
00:00:21,355 --> 00:00:23,022
Lily, you're making
the bean dip.

10
00:00:23,024 --> 00:00:26,191
Uh, robin, you're on chips
and pretzels, and barney,

11
00:00:26,193 --> 00:00:28,394
I'm giving you nothing to do
so you can just focus

12
00:00:28,396 --> 00:00:29,728
On controlling
your gambling problem.

13
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:31,563
(scoffs):
"problem."

14
00:00:31,565 --> 00:00:33,032
Oh, poor superman,

15
00:00:33,034 --> 00:00:36,502
He should really do something
about his <i>flying</i> problem.

16
00:00:36,504 --> 00:00:39,304
It's not a problem if
you're awesome at it.

17
00:00:39,306 --> 00:00:41,373
And I will be going
to quinn's to pick up

18
00:00:41,375 --> 00:00:42,708
The world's greatest food,

19
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:44,343
The super bowl
hot wings platter.

20
00:00:44,345 --> 00:00:46,145
If I were a chicken,

21
00:00:46,147 --> 00:00:47,713
I'd go cannibal
for those bad boys.

22
00:00:47,715 --> 00:00:49,548
Just eat my own damn wing off.

23
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:52,110
I don't care.
I'm crazy like that.

24
00:00:52,419 --> 00:00:54,186
Here's the info
for tomorrow night.

25
00:00:54,188 --> 00:00:55,421
What's tomorrow night?

26
00:00:55,423 --> 00:00:57,723
Oh, god, you didn't hear?

27
00:00:58,091 --> 00:00:59,558
Mark died.

28
00:01:00,527 --> 00:01:02,361
Oh...
Oh, my god.

29
00:01:02,363 --> 00:01:04,063
The funeral's tomorrow at 6:00,

30
00:01:04,065 --> 00:01:07,766
And I know it would have meant
a lot to mark if you came.

31
00:01:07,768 --> 00:01:09,835
You guys were
his favorite customers.

32
00:01:09,837 --> 00:01:11,537
Stay strong.
Oh, wow.

33
00:01:11,539 --> 00:01:14,073
Sorry. We're so sorry.
Our condolences.

34
00:01:14,075 --> 00:01:15,107
Oh...

35
00:01:15,109 --> 00:01:17,376
Who was mark?

36
00:01:17,378 --> 00:01:18,710
Barney:
No idea.

37
00:01:18,712 --> 00:01:20,779
Marshall:
Not a clue.

38
00:01:20,781 --> 00:01:23,582
Well, I guess
we should go, right?

39
00:01:23,584 --> 00:01:25,584
Marshall:
Wait...

40
00:01:25,586 --> 00:01:28,146
Tomorrow night at 6:00,
that's the super bowl.

41
00:01:28,755 --> 00:01:30,289
Okay, I feel terrible,

42
00:01:30,291 --> 00:01:32,291
But the truth is
we didn't know mike.

43
00:01:32,293 --> 00:01:34,893
Mark. Mark, and as long
as we send flowers,

44
00:01:34,895 --> 00:01:36,795
I can't think of any reason
we'd have to go.

45
00:01:36,797 --> 00:01:38,964
Get out of here!

46
00:01:38,966 --> 00:01:42,601
I never want to see your
face in this bar again!

47
00:01:43,236 --> 00:01:45,070
This soulless bastard

48
00:01:45,072 --> 00:01:47,139
Just told me he can't
come to mark's funeral

49
00:01:47,141 --> 00:01:49,074
Because he wants
to watch the super bowl.

50
00:01:49,076 --> 00:01:50,542
Could you believe that?

51
00:01:52,078 --> 00:01:54,279
You guys are coming, right?

52
00:01:54,281 --> 00:01:57,801
Yes... Wouldn't miss it for the world.
Oh, yeah.

53
00:02:11,764 --> 00:02:13,265
Okay, here's the plan.

54
00:02:13,267 --> 00:02:14,967
Record the game,
go to the funeral

55
00:02:14,969 --> 00:02:16,835
Pay our respects to matt...
Mark.

56
00:02:16,837 --> 00:02:19,938
Mark, and start watching
only an hour late.

57
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:23,642
Okay, that's great, but just
to make sure it records,

58
00:02:23,644 --> 00:02:24,676
Maybe we should bow our heads

59
00:02:24,678 --> 00:02:26,245
And say a quiet prayer
to the tivo gods.

60
00:02:28,348 --> 00:02:31,250
Almighty tivo,

61
00:02:31,252 --> 00:02:34,086
We thank you for all
the gifts you have given us:

62
00:02:34,088 --> 00:02:36,755
The power to freeze
live tv to go take a leak

63
00:02:36,757 --> 00:02:38,423
Is nothing short of godlike.

64
00:02:38,425 --> 00:02:42,494
Let's not forget fast-
forwarding through commercials.

65
00:02:42,496 --> 00:02:44,296
It seems greedy to ask
anything more from you,

66
00:02:44,298 --> 00:02:46,165
O magic box,

67
00:02:46,167 --> 00:02:50,302
But if you malfunction
and miss the super bowl,

68
00:02:50,304 --> 00:02:53,138
We will destroy you in the
alley with baseball bats.

69
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:54,640
Both:
Amen.

70
00:02:54,642 --> 00:02:56,708
We are not fast-forwarding
through the commercials.

71
00:02:56,710 --> 00:02:57,943
Yeah, they're the best part.

72
00:02:57,945 --> 00:02:59,945
Oh, come on.
Remember last year?

73
00:02:59,947 --> 00:03:02,681
Who wants to watch a monkey
in a coconut bra order a pizza?

74
00:03:02,683 --> 00:03:03,715
(both laughing)

75
00:03:03,717 --> 00:03:05,617
Lily: My god, that
monkey was so cute!

76
00:03:05,619 --> 00:03:07,052
The last time.

77
00:03:07,054 --> 00:03:08,353
Seriously, that's the last time

78
00:03:08,355 --> 00:03:09,655
I'm gonna call you today.

79
00:03:09,657 --> 00:03:10,856
Okay.

80
00:03:10,858 --> 00:03:13,025
Good-bye.

81
00:03:13,027 --> 00:03:15,227
You didn't hang up either!

82
00:03:15,229 --> 00:03:16,728
I know! You hang up!

83
00:03:16,730 --> 00:03:19,290
You hang up!
(laughs)

84
00:03:20,233 --> 00:03:21,800
My bookie. Great guy.

85
00:03:21,802 --> 00:03:23,135
So let me get this straight.

86
00:03:23,137 --> 00:03:25,170
A funeral is the one
time you don't suit up?

87
00:03:25,172 --> 00:03:28,040
Have I taught you nothing, ted?
Virtually.

88
00:03:28,042 --> 00:03:30,576
Suits are full of joy.

89
00:03:30,578 --> 00:03:34,012
They're the sartorial equivalent
of a baby's smile.

90
00:03:34,014 --> 00:03:35,247
"Sartorial"?

91
00:03:35,249 --> 00:03:36,415
"Of or pertaining

92
00:03:36,417 --> 00:03:37,983
To tailors or their trade."

93
00:03:37,985 --> 00:03:39,151
Suits are for the living.

94
00:03:39,153 --> 00:03:41,353
That's why when
it's my time to r.I.P.

95
00:03:41,355 --> 00:03:43,922
I'm going out of this world
the same way I came into it...

96
00:03:43,924 --> 00:03:45,424
Buck naked. Yeah.

97
00:03:45,426 --> 00:03:47,025
It's gonna be awesome.

98
00:03:47,027 --> 00:03:49,895
Open bar for the guys,
open casket for the ladies.

99
00:03:49,897 --> 00:03:52,297
? What up?!

100
00:03:56,703 --> 00:03:58,904
That's so funny!
Like that?

101
00:04:11,084 --> 00:04:15,687
All:
Oh...!

102
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:19,091
(sadly):
Oh...

103
00:04:23,463 --> 00:04:24,863
Such a waste.

104
00:04:24,865 --> 00:04:27,299
I know.
He was so young.

105
00:04:27,301 --> 00:04:28,900
A hand-stitched, cashmere,

106
00:04:28,902 --> 00:04:30,869
Double-breasted
dolce & gabbana.

107
00:04:30,871 --> 00:04:32,971
It must be so frightened.

108
00:04:32,973 --> 00:04:34,406
This is going faster
than I thought.

109
00:04:34,408 --> 00:04:36,908
We'll make an appearance
at the bar for the wake,

110
00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:38,877
We'll be watching
the game by 8:00.

111
00:04:38,879 --> 00:04:40,545
And even though
we didn't see any whales,

112
00:04:40,547 --> 00:04:44,216
Mark and I both said it was
the best day of our lives.

113
00:04:44,218 --> 00:04:45,317
Hmm.
Hmm.

114
00:04:45,319 --> 00:04:47,819
Okay, I'm getting us
another round.

115
00:04:47,821 --> 00:04:48,987
And when I come back,

116
00:04:48,989 --> 00:04:52,124
Everyone else is telling
their favorite mark story.

117
00:04:52,126 --> 00:04:55,294
Oh...

118
00:04:55,296 --> 00:04:57,596
Dibs on the one carl just told.

119
00:04:57,598 --> 00:05:00,265
Okay, I have to be
at work exactly

120
00:05:00,267 --> 00:05:01,800
One super bowl from now.

121
00:05:01,802 --> 00:05:04,169
Oh, let's face it, we're not
going to get to watch it.

122
00:05:04,171 --> 00:05:05,437
We should just find out
the score.

123
00:05:05,439 --> 00:05:07,606
Oh, thank god!
I'll find out.

124
00:05:07,608 --> 00:05:09,975
We have to watch
the game together.

125
00:05:09,977 --> 00:05:11,443
It's tradition.

126
00:05:11,445 --> 00:05:13,478
Think of all the great times
we've had watching this game.

127
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:15,981
Second down, everyone drink.

128
00:05:17,583 --> 00:05:19,284
Ted, it's not a drinking game

129
00:05:19,286 --> 00:05:21,586
If you drink anytime
anything happens.

130
00:05:21,588 --> 00:05:23,855
Are these chicken wings
or angel wings?

131
00:05:23,857 --> 00:05:25,924
God, I love these things.

132
00:05:26,626 --> 00:05:28,126
I love you guys.

133
00:05:28,128 --> 00:05:29,294
This is so great,

134
00:05:29,296 --> 00:05:31,330
All of us watching
the super bowl together.

135
00:05:31,332 --> 00:05:32,731
This is special.

136
00:05:34,767 --> 00:05:37,102
We need to do this
every year... promise me!

137
00:05:37,104 --> 00:05:38,370
Calm down, buddy.

138
00:05:38,372 --> 00:05:40,672
Oh, commercials!

139
00:05:40,674 --> 00:05:42,874
Everyone drink!

140
00:05:42,876 --> 00:05:43,942
(all groan)

141
00:05:43,944 --> 00:05:46,678
God, this is such
a great tradition,

142
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,480
All of us watching
the game together.

143
00:05:48,482 --> 00:05:50,182
How did this start?

144
00:05:50,184 --> 00:05:52,451
Hey, barney, I bet you 20 bucks

145
00:05:52,453 --> 00:05:53,685
That casey misses
this field goal.

146
00:05:53,687 --> 00:05:55,220
I don't bet.
Betting's for suckers.

147
00:05:55,222 --> 00:05:57,222
Make it like a dollar
or something, you know.

148
00:05:57,224 --> 00:05:58,790
Who cares? No big deal.

149
00:05:58,792 --> 00:06:00,192
Fine.

150
00:06:00,194 --> 00:06:01,360
(all groan)

151
00:06:01,362 --> 00:06:02,828
See, there you go, he made it.

152
00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:03,962
You win.

153
00:06:03,964 --> 00:06:07,499
Wait. This is mine,
just like that?

154
00:06:07,501 --> 00:06:09,334
God, that feels good.

155
00:06:09,336 --> 00:06:11,670
No, that feels really... Good.

156
00:06:11,672 --> 00:06:13,472
What else can we bet on?

157
00:06:13,474 --> 00:06:16,341
Nothing, it's the halftime show.

158
00:06:16,343 --> 00:06:17,376
Oh, so lame.

159
00:06:17,378 --> 00:06:20,312
Nobody even pays attention.

160
00:06:20,314 --> 00:06:23,048
I mean, janet jackson,
who cares?

161
00:06:27,186 --> 00:06:29,254
(whispering):
God, how cool is robin?

162
00:06:29,256 --> 00:06:30,355
I can't believe you invited

163
00:06:30,357 --> 00:06:31,390
This girl we've only known

164
00:06:31,392 --> 00:06:33,258
For a few months
to our sacred day.

165
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:35,527
Now she's gonna be
in all the pictures.

166
00:06:35,529 --> 00:06:37,162
Yeah, yeah, whatever.
I'll give you the seahawks

167
00:06:37,164 --> 00:06:38,430
Plus six points for 500 bucks.

168
00:06:38,432 --> 00:06:40,599
Are you crazy? Maybe for $50.

169
00:06:40,601 --> 00:06:42,701
$50?! What fun is $50?!

170
00:06:42,703 --> 00:06:46,004
Why don't we just bet air?!
God, marshall!

171
00:06:46,006 --> 00:06:47,239
Okay, $50.

172
00:06:47,241 --> 00:06:48,507
Hey, I'll take that action.

173
00:06:48,509 --> 00:06:49,741
Seahawks, but make
it four points

174
00:06:49,743 --> 00:06:51,376
And make it a grand.

175
00:06:51,378 --> 00:06:53,445
Hey, these wings, are they
chicken wings or angel wings?

176
00:06:53,447 --> 00:06:54,846
Oh, commercials!

177
00:06:54,848 --> 00:06:57,616
Monkey with a coconut bra.
Hilarious.

178
00:06:59,452 --> 00:07:01,753
Look, we always watch
the super bowl together.

179
00:07:01,755 --> 00:07:04,589
So we make a pact
to watch it tomorrow at 6:00

180
00:07:04,591 --> 00:07:07,426
And go the next 18 hours
without finding out who won.

181
00:07:07,428 --> 00:07:08,727
That's impossible.

182
00:07:08,729 --> 00:07:10,228
I'm not gonna lie to you.

183
00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:11,129
It's not gonna be easy.

184
00:07:11,131 --> 00:07:13,532
That means no tv, no internet,

185
00:07:13,534 --> 00:07:15,767
No newspapers, nothing.

186
00:07:15,769 --> 00:07:17,102
Media blackout.

187
00:07:17,104 --> 00:07:19,371
But our tradition lives on.

188
00:07:19,373 --> 00:07:20,639
Who's in?

189
00:07:20,641 --> 00:07:22,407
I'm in.

190
00:07:22,409 --> 00:07:23,708
I'm in.
I'm in.

191
00:07:23,710 --> 00:07:25,544
What the hell, I'm in.
High five!

192
00:07:25,546 --> 00:07:27,245
Dude, we're at a wake.

193
00:07:27,247 --> 00:07:30,515
Sorry. Solemn low five.

194
00:07:35,322 --> 00:07:38,757
<i>None of us had any idea
how hard it would be</i>

195
00:07:38,759 --> 00:07:40,158
<i>To go nine hours
without hearing the outcome</i>

196
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,760
<i>Of the super bowl.</i>

197
00:07:41,762 --> 00:07:44,262
<i>I decided to work from home
to avoid contamination</i>

198
00:07:44,264 --> 00:07:45,397
<i>By the outside world.</i>

199
00:07:45,399 --> 00:07:46,565
(anxious muttering)

200
00:07:50,303 --> 00:07:53,238
Hey, take this
key and swallow it.

201
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:54,240
What? No.

202
00:07:54,241 --> 00:07:55,273
Come on, ted, you eat salads.

203
00:07:55,275 --> 00:07:56,608
It'll be out by game time.

204
00:07:56,610 --> 00:07:59,077
Lots more, no.

205
00:07:59,079 --> 00:08:00,645
I'm not messing around,
theodore.

206
00:08:00,647 --> 00:08:03,181
I've got a lot of money
riding on this game.

207
00:08:03,183 --> 00:08:04,983
If I don't handcuff myself
to this radiator,

208
00:08:04,985 --> 00:08:05,917
I'll check the score.

209
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:07,018
Please take the key.

210
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:08,086
Fine.

211
00:08:08,088 --> 00:08:09,354
But only because

212
00:08:09,356 --> 00:08:11,256
You didn't think through
a bathroom plan

213
00:08:11,258 --> 00:08:12,691
And I think that's funny.

214
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:19,164
(groans)

215
00:08:20,867 --> 00:08:23,835
<i>The media blackout
was particularly hard on robin</i>

216
00:08:23,837 --> 00:08:26,271
<i>Because, well,
she was the media.</i>

217
00:08:26,273 --> 00:08:28,807
But unfortunately,
the city won't be fixing

218
00:08:28,809 --> 00:08:31,443
The unusually large
pothole any time soon,

219
00:08:31,445 --> 00:08:33,879
So buckle up
if you're on the bqe.

220
00:08:33,881 --> 00:08:36,147
It's gonna be a bumpy one.

221
00:08:36,149 --> 00:08:38,149
Like morning commutes
needed to get any harder.

222
00:08:38,151 --> 00:08:40,318
You're right, kevin.

223
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,786
Well, robin, what do you say?

224
00:08:41,788 --> 00:08:43,221
I think it's time to check in

225
00:08:43,223 --> 00:08:44,689
With sid for a sports update.

226
00:08:44,691 --> 00:08:45,724
No!

227
00:08:45,726 --> 00:08:49,027
What?
No.

228
00:08:49,029 --> 00:08:51,162
But it's, uh, time for sports.

229
00:08:51,164 --> 00:08:52,964
No, it's not.

230
00:08:52,966 --> 00:08:55,200
It's time for weather.

231
00:08:55,202 --> 00:08:56,835
We, we just did weather.

232
00:08:56,837 --> 00:08:59,371
Well, weather's pretty fickle,

233
00:08:59,373 --> 00:09:01,373
It may have changed.

234
00:09:01,375 --> 00:09:02,974
What's it doing out there, lou?

235
00:09:05,645 --> 00:09:08,179
Pretty much the same thing
it was two minutes ago.

236
00:09:08,181 --> 00:09:11,082
Back to you, robin.

237
00:09:12,218 --> 00:09:15,820
Okay, now it's time for sports.

238
00:09:15,822 --> 00:09:18,924
No! Let's go
to traffic todd

239
00:09:18,926 --> 00:09:20,258
In the metro news 1
gridlock chopper...

240
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:22,820
Robin, it's time for sports!

241
00:09:25,898 --> 00:09:27,232
Over to you, sid.

242
00:09:27,234 --> 00:09:30,835
(hesitatingly): Thank
you, kevin and robin.

243
00:09:30,837 --> 00:09:33,838
Let's talk about the super bowl.

244
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:36,107
<i>Weeks earlier,
marshall had promised lily</i>

245
00:09:36,109 --> 00:09:39,277
He'd come into her kindergarten
<i>class for show-and-tell day.</i>

246
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:41,279
And he's a little bit
double-jointed...

247
00:09:41,281 --> 00:09:42,547
Ah?

248
00:09:42,549 --> 00:09:44,282
And his favorite animal

249
00:09:44,284 --> 00:09:45,717
Is the loch ness monster.

250
00:09:45,719 --> 00:09:47,118
Lily, how many times...?

251
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:49,054
Nessie is a gentle creature.

252
00:09:49,056 --> 00:09:51,690
We're trying to stay away
from terms like "monster."

253
00:09:51,692 --> 00:09:53,258
Well, I think

254
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:56,061
We can all agree, he
is much more interesting

255
00:09:56,063 --> 00:09:57,929
Than sally's
one-eyed goldfish.

256
00:09:57,931 --> 00:09:59,230
Three weeks in a row?

257
00:09:59,232 --> 00:10:00,465
Come on, sally.

258
00:10:01,467 --> 00:10:04,135
Okay, well, that's
all the time we have.

259
00:10:04,137 --> 00:10:05,770
Arts and crafts, everybody.

260
00:10:08,908 --> 00:10:10,275
Hey.

261
00:10:10,277 --> 00:10:11,042
I'm doug.

262
00:10:11,044 --> 00:10:14,379
Oh, hey, I'm marshall.

263
00:10:14,381 --> 00:10:17,983
Are you going to be staying
here for the rest of day?

264
00:10:17,985 --> 00:10:20,085
Yeah, I'm actually trying
to hide out

265
00:10:20,087 --> 00:10:22,287
'cause I don't want to know
who won the super bowl.

266
00:10:22,289 --> 00:10:24,055
I know who won.

267
00:10:24,057 --> 00:10:27,158
Oh, um, that's great,
but I really don't want to know,

268
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:29,227
So if you could just
keep that to yourself.

269
00:10:29,229 --> 00:10:32,597
How badly do you
not want to know?

270
00:10:32,599 --> 00:10:35,233
Excuse me?

271
00:10:35,235 --> 00:10:36,968
Ten bucks.

272
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:38,803
Are you serious?

273
00:10:38,805 --> 00:10:41,172
Just went up to eight.

274
00:10:42,308 --> 00:10:43,408
Unlock me, ted.

275
00:10:43,410 --> 00:10:44,309
I've never gone this long

276
00:10:44,311 --> 00:10:45,477
Without calling my bookie.

277
00:10:45,479 --> 00:10:47,212
He worries.

278
00:10:48,147 --> 00:10:50,682
Not until game time.

279
00:10:50,684 --> 00:10:51,950
Where are you going?

280
00:10:51,952 --> 00:10:53,118
Pick up the hot wings.

281
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,252
What?

282
00:10:54,254 --> 00:10:56,154
How the hell are you
planning on getting

283
00:10:56,156 --> 00:10:58,490
In and out of a sports bar
without seeing the score?

284
00:10:58,492 --> 00:10:59,658
There's tvs everywhere.

285
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:01,192
Ah, don't worry.

286
00:11:01,194 --> 00:11:02,360
I got it all planned out.

287
00:11:02,362 --> 00:11:03,261
First of all:

288
00:11:03,263 --> 00:11:05,196
<i>I placed duct tape</i>

289
00:11:05,198 --> 00:11:08,800
<i>So I can only see
out of two tiny holes.</i>

290
00:11:08,802 --> 00:11:12,804
<i>Next, I constructed blinders
out of an old cereal box.</i>

291
00:11:12,806 --> 00:11:15,607
<i>Top it all off: High-tech
noise-reducing headphones</i>

292
00:11:15,609 --> 00:11:17,542
I bought when marshall and lily
<i>first got back together</i>

293
00:11:17,544 --> 00:11:18,943
<i>And were doing it a lot.</i>

294
00:11:18,945 --> 00:11:22,447
<i>I call it
the sensory deprivator 5000.</i>

295
00:11:24,183 --> 00:11:25,050
Sorry.

296
00:11:25,052 --> 00:11:27,686
(tv playing in background)

297
00:11:27,688 --> 00:11:29,354
(breathy silence)

298
00:11:45,971 --> 00:11:47,672
(loud): Hello! Uh, my
name is ted mosby.

299
00:11:47,674 --> 00:11:49,974
I'm here to pick up
my hot wings.

300
00:11:49,976 --> 00:11:52,377
In my hand, you'll find
the exact total for the wings

301
00:11:52,379 --> 00:11:54,245
Plus a generous tip.

302
00:11:54,247 --> 00:11:55,647
Please take the cash.

303
00:11:55,649 --> 00:11:57,048
Put the wings in my hand

304
00:11:57,050 --> 00:11:59,384
(low, distant):
And I'll be on my way.

305
00:12:00,319 --> 00:12:02,220
Thank you!

306
00:12:06,859 --> 00:12:10,929
And that closes the book
on one heck of a super bowl.

307
00:12:10,931 --> 00:12:12,430
Back to you, kevin and robin.

308
00:12:12,432 --> 00:12:15,467
La, la, la, la, la,
la, la, la, la, la...

309
00:12:16,836 --> 00:12:19,070
We'll be right back.

310
00:12:19,072 --> 00:12:20,371
(news theme plays)

311
00:12:20,373 --> 00:12:22,006
Woman:
And we're clear.

312
00:12:22,008 --> 00:12:23,208
Robin:
Sorry.

313
00:12:23,210 --> 00:12:24,876
Um, robin, is it just me,

314
00:12:24,878 --> 00:12:26,344
Or were you doing something
different there?

315
00:12:26,346 --> 00:12:28,179
I haven't watched the game yet.

316
00:12:28,181 --> 00:12:30,115
I'm begging you, for
the rest of the newscast,

317
00:12:30,117 --> 00:12:32,517
There can't be any references
to who won the super bowl.

318
00:12:32,519 --> 00:12:34,285
I mean, change the teleprompter.

319
00:12:34,287 --> 00:12:36,020
No team names, nothing specific.

320
00:12:36,022 --> 00:12:38,289
That is crazy.
I can't do that.

321
00:12:40,192 --> 00:12:42,093
(cries): My friend mark
passed away this week.

322
00:12:42,095 --> 00:12:44,395
(crying) okay, sweetie, okay.

323
00:12:44,397 --> 00:12:45,196
Okay, I'm so sorry.

324
00:12:45,198 --> 00:12:46,231
Back in five...

325
00:12:46,233 --> 00:12:47,298
Four...
Oh, I know.

326
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:49,400
Three...
It's just so hard.

327
00:12:49,402 --> 00:12:51,069
(news theme plays)

328
00:12:51,071 --> 00:12:53,972
(groans)

329
00:13:13,092 --> 00:13:14,392
(sighs)

330
00:13:16,295 --> 00:13:17,729
Ha!

331
00:13:17,731 --> 00:13:19,798
Who's the idiot now?!

332
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:23,101
You said the sensory deprivator
5000 was stupid.

333
00:13:23,103 --> 00:13:24,836
But it totally worked!

334
00:13:24,838 --> 00:13:27,472
I couldn't see or hear anything
happening around.

335
00:13:27,474 --> 00:13:29,874
Right?! Right?!

336
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:32,844
No...!

337
00:13:32,846 --> 00:13:34,345
Oh!

338
00:13:35,781 --> 00:13:37,682
<i>I was about to have
a horrible realization.</i>

339
00:13:37,684 --> 00:13:40,018
Where's the dipping sauce?

340
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:41,319
(ominous chord plays)

341
00:13:43,122 --> 00:13:44,422
The team that won,

342
00:13:44,424 --> 00:13:46,257
Want to know what
their name rhymes with?

343
00:13:46,259 --> 00:13:48,293
Come on, dude.
You promised you'd stop

344
00:13:48,295 --> 00:13:50,328
If I ate all those crayons.

345
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:51,410
Why are you doing this?

346
00:13:53,098 --> 00:13:55,033
I'm in love with miss aldrin.

347
00:13:55,035 --> 00:13:59,037
Well, you can't have
miss aldrin, she's mine.

348
00:14:03,275 --> 00:14:04,375
(figure shattering)

349
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:09,881
Okay, now who did this?

350
00:14:14,186 --> 00:14:15,453
I did.

351
00:14:15,455 --> 00:14:18,056
Does that mean marshall
gets a time-out?

352
00:14:18,058 --> 00:14:21,793
Well, marshall's
a grownup, so...

353
00:14:21,795 --> 00:14:24,262
When one of us breaks something,
we get a time-out.

354
00:14:26,999 --> 00:14:28,433
Sorry.

355
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,341
And after the super bowl,

356
00:14:36,343 --> 00:14:39,177
The mayor of the losing team's
city had to pay up,

357
00:14:39,179 --> 00:14:41,145
Sending the mayor of
the winning team's city

358
00:14:41,147 --> 00:14:45,350
15 pounds of a delicacy
his or her city is famous for.

359
00:14:45,352 --> 00:14:49,220
Better fire up whatever type
of grill, steamer or fryer

360
00:14:49,222 --> 00:14:54,058
One might use to cook that
delicacy, winning team's mayor.

361
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:56,094
(fierce whisper):
Hey.

362
00:14:56,328 --> 00:14:57,362
Hey.

363
00:14:57,364 --> 00:14:59,030
I'm not talking to you.

364
00:14:59,032 --> 00:15:00,098
Yes, you are.

365
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:01,933
You'll do whatever I say.

366
00:15:01,935 --> 00:15:03,167
Hold your breath.

367
00:15:03,169 --> 00:15:05,069
I'm not holding my breath.

368
00:15:05,071 --> 00:15:06,237
The winning team was the...

369
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:07,572
(inhales deeply)

370
00:15:07,574 --> 00:15:09,674
Now here's how this
is going to work:

371
00:15:09,676 --> 00:15:13,011
You're going to take me to
three r-rated movies a week...

372
00:15:13,013 --> 00:15:15,046
<i>And then uncle marshall
got an idea.</i>

373
00:15:15,048 --> 00:15:17,548
<i>It was not one he was proud of
in retrospect,</i>

374
00:15:17,550 --> 00:15:21,319
<i>But desperate times...</i>

375
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:25,623
Oh, no.

376
00:15:25,625 --> 00:15:28,293
Somebody wet their pants.

377
00:15:28,295 --> 00:15:29,295
No, I didn't.

378
00:15:29,296 --> 00:15:30,296
Oh, really?

379
00:15:30,297 --> 00:15:31,562
Who's everyone gonna believe?

380
00:15:31,564 --> 00:15:33,431
I'm a grownup third-year
law student at columbia

381
00:15:33,433 --> 00:15:35,199
And you're just
a little pants wetter.

382
00:15:35,201 --> 00:15:36,534
So now I ask you a question:

383
00:15:36,536 --> 00:15:38,469
You want to be able
to quietly sneak off

384
00:15:38,471 --> 00:15:42,006
Or am I gonna have something
for show and tell today?

385
00:15:42,641 --> 00:15:44,108
Hey, everyone...

386
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:45,043
Okay, okay.

387
00:15:45,045 --> 00:15:46,411
You win.

388
00:15:46,413 --> 00:15:48,546
I want my money back.

389
00:15:51,317 --> 00:15:54,552
And your pudding snack pack.

390
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:01,059
Sir, who won the super bowl?

391
00:16:01,061 --> 00:16:02,660
Sorry.
I missed the game.

392
00:16:02,662 --> 00:16:04,395
You missed...?! How could
he miss the super bowl?

393
00:16:04,397 --> 00:16:05,397
Excuse me!

394
00:16:05,398 --> 00:16:06,431
Who won the super bowl?!

395
00:16:06,433 --> 00:16:08,566
I... Don't really
follow sports.

396
00:16:08,568 --> 00:16:10,001
Oh, my...!

397
00:16:11,170 --> 00:16:13,071
Emmitt smith!

398
00:16:13,073 --> 00:16:14,639
Oh, thank god.

399
00:16:14,641 --> 00:16:16,975
Yeah, I get that a lot.

400
00:16:16,977 --> 00:16:18,443
You got to tell me,
who won the super bowl?

401
00:16:18,445 --> 00:16:21,980
The game was last night?

402
00:16:21,982 --> 00:16:24,282
You know, once you win
two or three of those things,

403
00:16:24,284 --> 00:16:26,617
It's kind of like, eh.

404
00:16:26,619 --> 00:16:28,319
But you're emmitt smith.

405
00:16:28,321 --> 00:16:29,988
You're a football player,
it's super bowl Sunday.

406
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:32,657
What could possibly be more
important than football?!

407
00:16:33,692 --> 00:16:36,728
Dance, my friend. Dance.

408
00:16:39,365 --> 00:16:44,235
No...!

409
00:16:45,371 --> 00:16:47,405
(breathy silence)

410
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:03,054
(shouts):
Hello! It's me again.

411
00:17:03,056 --> 00:17:04,522
Oh!

412
00:17:04,524 --> 00:17:06,157
I didn't recognize you.

413
00:17:06,159 --> 00:17:08,726
Yeah, you forgot to give me
the dipping sauce!

414
00:17:13,499 --> 00:17:14,465
Ah.

415
00:17:14,467 --> 00:17:15,467
Yes.

416
00:17:15,468 --> 00:17:16,401
This is the one.

417
00:17:16,403 --> 00:17:17,969
<i>It was 4:00,</i>

418
00:17:17,971 --> 00:17:20,571
<i>And so far, all of us
had done the impossible.</i>

419
00:17:20,573 --> 00:17:23,374
<i>But then, almost simultaneously,</i>

420
00:17:23,376 --> 00:17:25,176
<i>Things started to go wrong.</i>

421
00:17:25,178 --> 00:17:27,478
And let's end the day
on a happy note.

422
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:29,514
There is a new arrival
at the bronx zoo.

423
00:17:29,516 --> 00:17:31,549
Trish sanchez has the story.

424
00:17:32,718 --> 00:17:36,320
(weather report plays on radio)

425
00:17:43,195 --> 00:17:44,762
Hey, buddy.
Hey, dude, look out.

426
00:17:44,764 --> 00:17:46,064
(breathy silence)

427
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:49,500
And in honor of yesterday's
big win...

428
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:52,670
(stations changing)

429
00:17:52,672 --> 00:17:55,506
The super bowl... there is
no more bitter defeat in sports

430
00:17:55,508 --> 00:17:56,941
Than to lose one.

431
00:17:58,744 --> 00:18:01,312
Hey, buddy, look out.
Dude, watch out!

432
00:18:03,282 --> 00:18:05,283
The zoo decided to name
the baby panda

433
00:18:05,285 --> 00:18:07,118
After super bowl champions...

434
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:09,020
No...!

435
00:18:09,022 --> 00:18:12,056
No...!

436
00:18:12,058 --> 00:18:15,193
No...!

437
00:18:25,237 --> 00:18:28,039
Yes...!

438
00:18:32,578 --> 00:18:34,645
Awesome. Just in time
for the kick-off.

439
00:18:34,647 --> 00:18:37,915
Mission accomplished. No.
Didn't find out.

440
00:18:37,917 --> 00:18:38,983
Great. Let's do it.

441
00:18:38,985 --> 00:18:41,419
I already fast-forwarded
through the four hours

442
00:18:41,421 --> 00:18:44,489
Of pre-game coverage,
so we are ready.

443
00:18:44,491 --> 00:18:45,623
Barney,

444
00:18:45,625 --> 00:18:46,991
I can't even look at you.

445
00:18:46,993 --> 00:18:48,459
I don't want any sign
of who won.

446
00:18:48,461 --> 00:18:50,394
Don't worry, I'm not going
to give anything away.

447
00:18:50,396 --> 00:18:52,697
Feel free to start without me.

448
00:18:54,299 --> 00:18:55,633
(door closes) ah...!

449
00:18:55,635 --> 00:18:56,734
Stupid!

450
00:18:56,736 --> 00:18:57,969
Stupid! Stupid!

451
00:18:57,971 --> 00:19:00,071
So much money! You
screwed it up, barney!

452
00:19:00,073 --> 00:19:01,405
You screwed everything up!

453
00:19:01,407 --> 00:19:03,141
Stupid! Stupid! Stupid!

454
00:19:04,243 --> 00:19:05,510
(calm):
Okay, let's watch the game.

455
00:19:05,512 --> 00:19:07,278
Barney, what the hell was that?

456
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:08,579
We know who you bet on.

457
00:19:08,581 --> 00:19:11,282
Now you've ruined
the game for everyone.

458
00:19:11,284 --> 00:19:12,450
Yeah.

459
00:19:12,452 --> 00:19:14,018
Thanks a lot, barney.

460
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:15,153
Way to blow it.

461
00:19:15,155 --> 00:19:17,989
Yeah, I didn't know
and now I do know.

462
00:19:17,991 --> 00:19:20,725
There's no point in
even watching the game.

463
00:19:27,466 --> 00:19:30,635
Well, at least the
commercials aren't ruined.

464
00:19:30,637 --> 00:19:32,303
Wings are still good.

465
00:19:32,305 --> 00:19:34,338
Beer still works.

466
00:19:36,375 --> 00:19:37,475
Ah, what the hell.

467
00:19:37,477 --> 00:19:40,111
Let's watch barney
lose some money.

468
00:19:41,947 --> 00:19:42,980
Hey, so check this out:

469
00:19:42,982 --> 00:19:45,216
I got extorted by
a five-year-old today.

470
00:19:45,218 --> 00:19:47,685
I almost got fired today.

471
00:19:47,687 --> 00:19:49,020
I met emmitt smith today.

472
00:19:49,022 --> 00:19:50,321
Ooh, you go first.

473
00:19:50,323 --> 00:19:52,557
I tried out the sensory
deprivator 5000.

474
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:54,225
Yeah, go ahead, barney.

475
00:19:54,227 --> 00:19:56,961
Well, I was frantically
running down the street,

476
00:19:56,963 --> 00:19:58,629
Trying to find out
the score to the game...

477
00:19:58,631 --> 00:20:00,298
Ted:
<i>And here's the funny part,</i>

478
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:02,900
<i>As unforgettable
as that super bowl was,</i>

479
00:20:02,902 --> 00:20:06,137
<i>Here it is 23 years later
and I don't remember who won...</i>

480
00:20:06,139 --> 00:20:07,405
(cheering)

481
00:20:07,407 --> 00:20:09,373
<i>Hell, I don't even remember
who played.</i>

482
00:20:09,375 --> 00:20:11,475
<i>What I do remember
is that we drank beer,</i>

483
00:20:11,477 --> 00:20:14,345
<i>We ate wings and we watched
the super bowl together.</i>

484
00:20:14,347 --> 00:20:16,347
(cheering)

485
00:20:16,349 --> 00:20:18,916
<i>Because, sometimes,
even if you know</i>

486
00:20:18,918 --> 00:20:20,518
<i>How something's going to end,</i>

487
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:22,853
<i>That doesn't mean
you can't enjoy the ride.</i>

488
00:20:22,855 --> 00:20:25,356
<i>We even raised a toast
to good old mike.</i>

489
00:20:25,358 --> 00:20:26,757
<i>I mean mark... Matt...</i>

490
00:20:33,565 --> 00:20:35,032
I didn't only lose the game,

491
00:20:35,034 --> 00:20:37,435
I lost every single prop bet.

492
00:20:37,437 --> 00:20:39,437
Total penalty yardage,

493
00:20:39,439 --> 00:20:41,372
Number of replay-challenges,

494
00:20:41,374 --> 00:20:42,740
Coin toss...

495
00:20:42,742 --> 00:20:44,942
What are the odds of losing
the coin toss?

496
00:20:44,944 --> 00:20:47,111
50-50, give or take.

497
00:20:47,113 --> 00:20:49,213
Interceptions, field-goals,

498
00:20:49,215 --> 00:20:51,382
Total sacks,

499
00:20:51,384 --> 00:20:53,551
Whether or not there'd
be a safety, first...

500
00:20:53,553 --> 00:20:56,654
(breathy silence)
