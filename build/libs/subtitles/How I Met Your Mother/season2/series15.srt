1
00:00:01,069 --> 00:00:03,888
Kids, never underestimate
the power of destiny.

2
00:00:04,299 --> 00:00:06,719
Because when you least expect it,
the littlest thing

3
00:00:06,729 --> 00:00:09,119
can cause a ripple effect
that changes your life.

4
00:00:09,753 --> 00:00:11,987
Take for instance
my trip to Chicago.

5
00:00:12,444 --> 00:00:14,803
That security guard was
a little bit handsy.

6
00:00:14,813 --> 00:00:16,696
That's funny.
She barely touched me.

7
00:00:16,902 --> 00:00:18,975
Uh, Gate 23. Come on.

8
00:00:18,985 --> 00:00:21,574
If we miss this flight,
I will never forgive myself.

9
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:24,135
Why was this flight
so important?

10
00:00:24,168 --> 00:00:27,300
Let's back up a few months
to the fall of 2006.

11
00:00:27,610 --> 00:00:29,885
I had just sold my first
building design and become

12
00:00:29,891 --> 00:00:32,686
the youngest project manager
in my firm's history.

13
00:00:32,959 --> 00:00:34,910
Suddenly I was
being headhunted.

14
00:00:34,929 --> 00:00:38,492
One firm was even considering me to
run their entire New York office.

15
00:00:38,766 --> 00:00:40,642
They were flying me in
for a final interview

16
00:00:40,656 --> 00:00:42,701
at their corporate
headquarters in Chicago.

17
00:00:42,716 --> 00:00:44,653
It was the opportunity
of a lifetime.

18
00:00:44,665 --> 00:00:46,093
It was my destiny.

19
00:00:46,268 --> 00:00:47,832
There was just one problem.

20
00:00:47,848 --> 00:00:49,960
Hi, wait, two more.

21
00:00:49,975 --> 00:00:51,801
Sorry, you're too late,
I already shut the doors.

22
00:00:51,835 --> 00:00:54,062
Well, I'm sure if we pull
real hard we can open them.

23
00:00:54,078 --> 00:00:57,000
Hmm, I wish it worked like that, but
see, once I close those doors,
that's it.

24
00:00:57,038 --> 00:00:59,163
Nobody else is allowed
down that jet-way.

25
00:00:59,986 --> 00:01:01,333
Except for that guy.

26
00:01:02,688 --> 00:01:06,492
Please, if-if I miss this flight, I'll miss
the chance to interview for my dream job.

27
00:01:06,505 --> 00:01:07,620
I'm sorry, sir.

28
00:01:07,638 --> 00:01:09,830
His dream job!
Didn't you ever have a dream job?

29
00:01:09,845 --> 00:01:13,163
Something from when you were a little
girl, that was all you wanted to do?

30
00:01:13,178 --> 00:01:15,340
I mean, for God's sakes,
I'm sure you didn't go to bed at night

31
00:01:15,378 --> 00:01:16,942
dreaming about being a...

32
00:01:17,668 --> 00:01:19,311
I mean, uh...

33
00:01:19,698 --> 00:01:21,422
This is a cool job.

34
00:01:22,175 --> 00:01:24,220
Please, I have to
be on this flight.

35
00:01:24,238 --> 00:01:25,610
I'll see what I can do.

36
00:01:25,628 --> 00:01:27,013
But it doesn't look good.

37
00:01:27,097 --> 00:01:27,923
Thanks.

38
00:01:28,705 --> 00:01:30,763
Your uniforms are pretty.

41
00:01:48,158 --> 00:01:49,282
Okay.

42
00:01:49,298 --> 00:01:51,751
They haven't armed the doors yet,
so you still have a chance.

43
00:01:51,767 --> 00:01:54,121
It's up to the captain now
and they're calling us back.

44
00:01:54,136 --> 00:01:56,323
Great, please let us know
soon as you hear anything.

45
00:01:56,335 --> 00:01:58,563
Sure, and for the future,
we recommend you arrive

46
00:01:58,578 --> 00:02:01,183
at the airport an hour and
a half before your flight,

47
00:02:01,197 --> 00:02:03,133
not, you know,
one minute after.

48
00:02:03,145 --> 00:02:04,812
Normally, I'm
incredibly responsible.

49
00:02:04,825 --> 00:02:07,141
I just had to go to court this
morning and get sentenced.

50
00:02:07,617 --> 00:02:09,702
Not that I'm a
criminal or anything.

51
00:02:09,718 --> 00:02:11,732
Yeah, he just jumped
a subway turnstile.

52
00:02:11,746 --> 00:02:15,023
You seem to have a lot of problems
with the rules of travel.

53
00:02:16,788 --> 00:02:17,911
Hello?

54
00:02:20,315 --> 00:02:22,743
Oh, that is great news.

55
00:02:22,757 --> 00:02:24,842
It's my mom--
she found her missing earring.

56
00:02:24,867 --> 00:02:26,853
Have a seat.
I'll call you when I hear something.

57
00:02:26,865 --> 00:02:28,142
Where was it?

58
00:02:29,175 --> 00:02:30,751
That thing better
have call waiting.

59
00:02:30,767 --> 00:02:33,333
Could you just call the firm
and explain what happened?

60
00:02:33,347 --> 00:02:34,673
It's down to three people

61
00:02:34,687 --> 00:02:36,843
and I know they need to
make their decision today.

62
00:02:36,868 --> 00:02:40,231
I sort of feel my not showing up
might put me at a disadvantage.

63
00:02:41,408 --> 00:02:43,112
I'm so stupid.

64
00:02:43,128 --> 00:02:45,221
Why did I have to
jump that turnstile?

65
00:02:45,238 --> 00:02:47,923
Hey, don't be so
hard on yourself.

66
00:02:47,938 --> 00:02:50,803
And isn't this whole thing
really Barney's fault?

67
00:02:50,906 --> 00:02:52,270
She had a point.

68
00:02:52,287 --> 00:02:54,070
It was kind of Barney's fault.

69
00:02:54,085 --> 00:02:55,863
Let's back up a few months.

70
00:02:56,565 --> 00:02:58,473
Oh, Marshall,
how's the broken toe?

71
00:02:58,488 --> 00:03:00,070
Oh, man, it kills.

72
00:03:00,085 --> 00:03:01,672
You want some aspirin, baby?

73
00:03:01,687 --> 00:03:03,790
You know I don't
believe in pain killers.

74
00:03:05,968 --> 00:03:08,160
Wow, your first broken bone.

75
00:03:08,177 --> 00:03:10,061
Kind of kills your whole
"Unbreakable" theory.

76
00:03:10,077 --> 00:03:12,771
Marshall used to think
he was indestructible.

77
00:03:12,785 --> 00:03:15,253
Well, it added up.
I've never broken anything.

78
00:03:15,265 --> 00:03:16,910
I've never been sick,
and when I need to,

79
00:03:16,928 --> 00:03:19,410
I can summon
incredible strength.

80
00:03:19,436 --> 00:03:22,192
Ted, tell her the story
of the really heavy door.

81
00:03:22,266 --> 00:03:24,063
There was a really heavy door.

82
00:03:24,077 --> 00:03:25,470
He opened it.

83
00:03:25,696 --> 00:03:27,650
On one pull.

84
00:03:29,315 --> 00:03:32,173
Well, you must be really bummed, you're
not gonna be able to run tomorrow.

85
00:03:32,206 --> 00:03:33,580
Yeah. It sucks,

86
00:03:33,598 --> 00:03:36,960
all that work I put in training
for the marathon was a total waste.

87
00:03:36,976 --> 00:03:38,900
Training for a marathon.

88
00:03:40,417 --> 00:03:41,390
What?

89
00:03:41,406 --> 00:03:44,232
You don't need to train for a marathon.
You just run it.

90
00:03:44,547 --> 00:03:46,022
You're kidding, right?

91
00:03:46,035 --> 00:03:48,791
Not at all. I could run a
marathon anytime I wanted to.

92
00:03:48,946 --> 00:03:51,743
So like tomorrow, you think you
could wake up, roll out of bed,

93
00:03:51,755 --> 00:03:53,522
and just run the New
York City Marathon?

94
00:03:53,536 --> 00:03:54,712
Absolutely.

95
00:03:54,726 --> 00:03:57,773
Barney, we're talking 
about 42 kilometers.

96
00:03:57,787 --> 00:04:00,230
Thanks, Canada.
I'll take it from here.

97
00:04:00,245 --> 00:04:02,381
Barney, it's like 26 miles.

98
00:04:02,398 --> 00:04:04,221
Here's how you run a marathon.

99
00:04:04,236 --> 00:04:06,842
Step one, you start running.

100
00:04:07,567 --> 00:04:09,091
There is no step two.

101
00:04:09,577 --> 00:04:11,771
Okay, you know what? Prove it.

102
00:04:11,788 --> 00:04:13,771
Take my number and
run in my place.

103
00:04:13,785 --> 00:04:17,171
I will bet you 50 bucks you
don't even finish the race.

104
00:04:17,185 --> 00:04:18,522
50 bucks?

105
00:04:18,537 --> 00:04:20,411
Gee,  Grandpa, if I win,

106
00:04:20,428 --> 00:04:22,962
maybe I can buy myself
an ice-cream cone.

107
00:04:23,688 --> 00:04:25,592
Make it $10,000.

108
00:04:25,706 --> 00:04:27,950
You have a gambling problem.
You'll bet me 50.

109
00:04:27,966 --> 00:04:29,430
Fine, then no bet.

110
00:04:29,445 --> 00:04:30,912
Okay, $50.

111
00:04:33,295 --> 00:04:35,681
The next morning,
as the marathon began,

112
00:04:35,695 --> 00:04:37,883
we were focused on
Marshall's computer.

113
00:04:37,898 --> 00:04:40,452
Each runner gets a tracking chip
so you can follow them online,

114
00:04:40,465 --> 00:04:43,463
see when they pass certain checkpoints.
Barney's got mine in his shoe.

115
00:04:44,025 --> 00:04:45,422
Ooh, he's starting!

116
00:04:45,588 --> 00:04:47,371
This ought to be good.

117
00:04:52,816 --> 00:04:53,782
Wow.

118
00:04:54,056 --> 00:04:56,900
He's already passing
the second checkpoint.

119
00:04:56,998 --> 00:04:59,310
This tracking thing is amazing.

120
00:04:59,326 --> 00:05:01,672
When we get married,
you're getting one of these.

121
00:05:07,658 --> 00:05:10,441
Wow. Look at his time.
It's pretty impressive.

122
00:05:10,456 --> 00:05:12,552
He's gotta be cheating, okay.

123
00:05:12,566 --> 00:05:13,772
He knew we'd check.

124
00:05:13,785 --> 00:05:15,393
Yeah, he'll do
anything to win a bet.

125
00:05:15,406 --> 00:05:18,852
Remember that time he bet me that Men
at Work sang "Hungry Like the Wolf,"

126
00:05:18,867 --> 00:05:21,462
and when he found out that they didn't,
he tried to hire them to?

127
00:05:21,528 --> 00:05:24,900
Well, it looks like, "Barney" should
be coming over the Queensboro Bridge

128
00:05:24,916 --> 00:05:28,151
and up First Avenue within
the next hour or so. But...

129
00:05:28,166 --> 00:05:30,701
there is no way that
that's really him.

130
00:05:30,877 --> 00:05:32,181
It's really him.

131
00:05:39,705 --> 00:05:41,800
Hey! That's mine.

132
00:05:41,977 --> 00:05:43,912
Yeah, you'd better run!

133
00:05:46,995 --> 00:05:50,140
- What up, non-finishers?
- Wow.

134
00:05:50,156 --> 00:05:52,442
- Very impressive, Barney.
- Right?

135
00:05:52,457 --> 00:05:54,281
Yeah, my time would have been
like a half an hour better,

136
00:05:54,317 --> 00:05:57,271
but I met this total hottie on
Mile Seven. We took a quick detour

137
00:05:57,285 --> 00:05:59,842
and had our own mini
marathon behind a Nathan's.

138
00:05:59,856 --> 00:06:01,042
I won.

139
00:06:01,626 --> 00:06:04,632
I'm not sure anyone in
that story is a winner.

140
00:06:05,906 --> 00:06:07,902
So where's my 50 bucks?

141
00:06:08,036 --> 00:06:09,191
All right.

142
00:06:10,188 --> 00:06:13,191
I got to admit,
you earned this.

143
00:06:14,477 --> 00:06:17,990
Huh? Can't believe they haven't
made a coin for this yet.

144
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:19,995
Anyway, I'm heading home.

145
00:06:20,231 --> 00:06:21,946
Might go hit the gym.

146
00:06:22,509 --> 00:06:24,840
Oh, hey, just so you know,
uh, all marathon runners get

147
00:06:24,859 --> 00:06:26,570
to use the subway
for free today.

148
00:06:26,588 --> 00:06:29,943
Wow. You know I really should
check out this "subway."

149
00:06:29,955 --> 00:06:31,313
Heard so much about it.

150
00:06:31,327 --> 00:06:33,691
Wow. Look at me. Slumming it.

151
00:06:34,078 --> 00:06:36,552
Maybe I'll make a
weekend out of it

152
00:06:36,566 --> 00:06:39,043
and I'll call my bridge
and tunnel girl tonight.

153
00:06:39,108 --> 00:06:41,142
You're dating a girl
from New Jersey?

154
00:06:41,157 --> 00:06:42,481
No.

155
00:06:46,097 --> 00:06:47,711
So Barney did it.

156
00:06:47,725 --> 00:06:49,171
He actually finished
the marathon.

157
00:06:49,396 --> 00:06:52,623
But a little while later...
I got an interesting phone call.

158
00:06:52,635 --> 00:06:54,333
- Hello?
- Ted, it's Barney.

159
00:06:54,345 --> 00:06:56,763
Listen to me, I need you to come
and pick me up on the subway.

160
00:06:56,795 --> 00:06:58,501
What, what are
you talking about?

161
00:06:58,517 --> 00:07:01,410
I was sitting here,
totally minding my own business.

162
00:07:07,736 --> 00:07:08,901
Finisher.

163
00:07:09,918 --> 00:07:12,030
Yeah, you know what I mean.

164
00:07:12,145 --> 00:07:14,031
86th street.

165
00:07:35,855 --> 00:07:37,882
My legs don't work.

166
00:07:37,898 --> 00:07:40,911
I've already ridden the
subway twice end to end.

167
00:07:40,926 --> 00:07:43,001
I've seen where
it turns around.

168
00:07:43,036 --> 00:07:46,491
Ted, you don't ever want to see
where the subway turns around.

169
00:07:47,767 --> 00:07:50,101
Barney's legs won't work.

170
00:07:50,117 --> 00:07:51,723
He's riding the subway
from end to end

171
00:07:51,736 --> 00:07:53,890
because he physically
can't get off the train.

172
00:07:53,907 --> 00:07:55,882
Best 50 bucks I ever spent.

173
00:07:56,116 --> 00:07:57,340
Listen to me, Ted.

174
00:07:57,355 --> 00:08:00,340
I'm going to lose you any second.
I'm on the fourth car of the six train

175
00:08:00,358 --> 00:08:02,660
heading south from Pelham
Bay Park in the Bronx.

176
00:08:02,675 --> 00:08:05,582
Meet me at the 86th Street station in,
like, half an hour?

177
00:08:05,596 --> 00:08:07,701
All right. I'll be right there.

178
00:08:07,716 --> 00:08:09,263
Stay where you are.

179
00:08:10,267 --> 00:08:12,121
Ted, Ted.

180
00:08:29,695 --> 00:08:33,491
Oh, come on. You're not even going
to give up your seat for him?

181
00:08:35,746 --> 00:08:37,640
I'm sorry. I can't.

182
00:08:37,658 --> 00:08:38,991
Douche.

183
00:08:54,917 --> 00:08:57,230
- Barney?!
- Ted!

184
00:09:00,678 --> 00:09:01,723
H ey!

185
00:09:04,537 --> 00:09:06,490
No...!

186
00:09:08,077 --> 00:09:10,382
See? If Barney never
tried to run the marathon,

187
00:09:10,396 --> 00:09:12,130
you never would have
jumped that turnstile,

188
00:09:12,147 --> 00:09:14,172
you wouldn't have had
that court date today,

189
00:09:14,186 --> 00:09:15,881
and we would have
made this flight.

190
00:09:16,045 --> 00:09:17,181
You're right.

191
00:09:17,198 --> 00:09:19,041
Everything can be
traced back to him.

192
00:09:19,867 --> 00:09:21,980
Like that rash we
all got at Christmas.

193
00:09:22,988 --> 00:09:24,711
All right,
I have to see what's going on.

194
00:09:25,835 --> 00:09:28,721
- So I was able to get you two seats.
- Really? That's great!

195
00:09:28,736 --> 00:09:31,592
No, no, not you. I'm talking to
my mom about Blue Man Group.

196
00:09:31,606 --> 00:09:33,000
Ma, can I call you back?

197
00:09:33,217 --> 00:09:35,092
Okay, what about our flight?
Can we get on?

198
00:09:35,105 --> 00:09:37,491
I'm still waiting for... Huh.

199
00:09:38,175 --> 00:09:39,762
Looks like your
flight left already.

200
00:09:39,776 --> 00:09:42,393
What? No, n-n-n-no, n-no.
I have to be in Chicago today.

201
00:09:42,407 --> 00:09:43,923
Well, he never even
called you back?

202
00:09:43,935 --> 00:09:46,522
Well, it's typical pilot.
They don't call you back at work

203
00:09:46,536 --> 00:09:48,622
and they don't call you back after
you spend two nights with them

204
00:09:48,657 --> 00:09:50,343
at a Radisson in Orlando.

205
00:09:55,488 --> 00:09:58,423
It turned out there was one other
flight that would just barely get me

206
00:09:58,438 --> 00:10:00,802
to Chicago on time
for my job interview,

207
00:10:00,826 --> 00:10:03,403
but it was all the way on the 
other side of the airport.

208
00:10:03,626 --> 00:10:05,433
What was the name of
the airline again?

209
00:10:05,446 --> 00:10:07,292
I think it was something
like Flights R' Us.

210
00:10:07,307 --> 00:10:08,413
Was  the "R" backwards?

211
00:10:08,425 --> 00:10:09,750
God, I hope not.

212
00:10:10,647 --> 00:10:13,181
- Geez.
- Stupid smart carts.

213
00:10:13,477 --> 00:10:15,420
More like dumb carts.

214
00:10:15,466 --> 00:10:17,833
If we miss this flight,
it's all Barney's fault.

215
00:10:18,348 --> 00:10:21,363
You know, Barney never would have
run the marathon in the first place

216
00:10:21,376 --> 00:10:23,673
-  if Marshall hadn't broken his toe.
- Yeah, so?

217
00:10:23,967 --> 00:10:25,853
What, you think
this is my fault?

218
00:10:27,187 --> 00:10:31,333
For Marshall, the initial idea to run
the marathon came way back in April.

219
00:10:31,346 --> 00:10:33,370
My pants are starting
to feel a little tight.

220
00:10:33,506 --> 00:10:36,971
Oh, that's okay.
I love that cute little belly.

221
00:10:41,718 --> 00:10:43,672
I cannot allow this.

222
00:10:43,688 --> 00:10:44,873
What?

223
00:10:46,186 --> 00:10:50,183
I am going to run the
New York City Marathon.

224
00:11:00,156 --> 00:11:02,792
"It is important to load
up on carbohydrates

225
00:11:02,806 --> 00:11:05,750
two to four hours
before a big run.

226
00:11:05,768 --> 00:11:08,132
Try a breakfast of a bagel,
a banana,

227
00:11:08,148 --> 00:11:11,103
oatmeal, strawberries
and some orange juice."

228
00:11:11,117 --> 00:11:13,850
Here you go, Marshmallow.
Just like the book said.

229
00:11:13,865 --> 00:11:17,681
Yeah, but from now on, I'm eating
all of my breakfast runner-style.

230
00:11:17,697 --> 00:11:19,610
Liquids are digested faster.

231
00:11:19,627 --> 00:11:21,631
That way, no energy is wasted,

232
00:11:21,646 --> 00:11:24,292
and it's all about the run.

233
00:11:54,098 --> 00:11:58,432
"Don't forget to give yourself
plenty of positive reinforcement."

234
00:11:59,578 --> 00:12:01,572
This is gonna be
your best run yet.

235
00:12:02,815 --> 00:12:06,042
You're going to accomplish
all of your goals.

236
00:12:06,817 --> 00:12:09,533
You are a robot sent
from the future

237
00:12:09,546 --> 00:12:11,453
to win the marathon!

238
00:12:12,796 --> 00:12:15,600
You are... Marshall.

239
00:12:16,238 --> 00:12:19,393
You are... Marshall.

240
00:12:19,437 --> 00:12:23,603
You are Marshall! Yeah!

241
00:12:29,235 --> 00:12:32,853
"Chafing or blisters can
occur in a number of areas,

242
00:12:32,866 --> 00:12:36,483
including the feet, armpits,
or even the nipples.

243
00:12:36,496 --> 00:12:40,400
Try using some petroleum
jelly on the affected areas."

244
00:13:00,115 --> 00:13:01,770
Oh, gosh!

245
00:13:16,917 --> 00:13:19,181
Dude, you are a
terrific runner.

246
00:13:19,765 --> 00:13:24,152
Tomorrow you're gonna run and
finish the New York City Marathon!

247
00:13:24,908 --> 00:13:26,191
You're the best.

248
00:13:27,065 --> 00:13:28,380
You look good.

249
00:13:29,787 --> 00:13:32,340
Nobody does it better than you.

250
00:13:32,358 --> 00:13:33,991
Marshall? Oh, my God!

251
00:13:35,637 --> 00:13:37,621
So, yes, it was your fault.

252
00:13:37,637 --> 00:13:39,902
I mean, if you don't show up at the
apartment in the middle of the day,

253
00:13:39,938 --> 00:13:42,591
Marshall doesn't break his toe,
Barney doesn't run in his place,

254
00:13:42,607 --> 00:13:44,461
I don't jump the turnstile
and get a court date,

255
00:13:44,496 --> 00:13:46,722
and we make our flight
in plenty of time!

256
00:13:48,788 --> 00:13:51,602
And I don't fall down and bite
my tongue at the airport.

257
00:13:51,746 --> 00:13:53,391
That really wasn't my fault.

258
00:13:53,405 --> 00:13:55,952
I wouldn't have walked in on
Marshall if it weren't for Lily.

259
00:13:55,966 --> 00:13:57,362
Hey, think about it.

260
00:13:58,107 --> 00:13:59,373
Hey, what's going on here?

261
00:13:59,386 --> 00:14:01,421
Oh, looks like they're
camping out for something.

262
00:14:01,438 --> 00:14:02,753
Yeah, but for what?

263
00:14:02,768 --> 00:14:04,993
I don't know. Usually there's a
Stormtrooper or Klingon in line

264
00:14:05,026 --> 00:14:06,722
to give you some indication.

265
00:14:07,206 --> 00:14:09,551
"Annual wedding dress blowout.

266
00:14:09,567 --> 00:14:12,721
Designer sample
dresses up to 90% off.

267
00:14:12,735 --> 00:14:14,793
Doors open tomorrow, 8:00 a.m."

268
00:14:14,807 --> 00:14:18,933
Oh, my God. Can you believe what some
nut bags will do to save a few bucks?

269
00:14:19,077 --> 00:14:21,091
We have to camp out.

270
00:14:21,128 --> 00:14:22,971
- Are you serious?
- You don't understand.

271
00:14:22,987 --> 00:14:25,393
This is an amazing sale.
I've heard about it before,

272
00:14:25,407 --> 00:14:27,391
but I never knew where it was.

273
00:14:27,407 --> 00:14:31,000
We'll have a wedding dress campout.
It'll be fun.

274
00:14:31,395 --> 00:14:33,271
I can't go.
I've got this thing.

275
00:14:33,285 --> 00:14:35,463
- What thing?
- A penis.

276
00:14:36,557 --> 00:14:39,370
- This is the place.
- Oh, wow.

277
00:14:39,388 --> 00:14:42,463
Badgley Mischka! Melissa Sweet!

278
00:14:42,478 --> 00:14:43,743
Vera Wang!

279
00:14:43,758 --> 00:14:47,822
Oh, Robin, do you have any idea
what you guys stumbled onto here?

280
00:14:47,858 --> 00:14:49,583
You said wang.

281
00:14:51,537 --> 00:14:55,993
Oh, this reminds me of the ticket
line to Lilith Fair, 1998.

282
00:14:56,008 --> 00:14:57,800
Only fewer mullets.

283
00:14:57,816 --> 00:15:02,593
You should feel good. You're only, like,
the tenth craziest bride in New York.

284
00:15:05,585 --> 00:15:07,533
Ooh, this is comfy.

285
00:15:07,548 --> 00:15:10,003
We might actually
be able to sleep.

286
00:15:11,197 --> 00:15:13,102
That's kind of annoying.

287
00:15:13,138 --> 00:15:17,373
Well, I'm sure somebody will be
out here to turn it off any minute.

288
00:15:29,908 --> 00:15:32,011
I don't think I can take this.

289
00:15:32,355 --> 00:15:34,473
Every time it turns off,
I think,

290
00:15:34,488 --> 00:15:37,473
oh, maybe it won't
turn on again,

291
00:15:37,736 --> 00:15:39,700
but then it does.

292
00:15:39,717 --> 00:15:41,231
Why does it, Robin?

293
00:15:41,247 --> 00:15:43,422
Why does it keep turning on?

294
00:15:43,438 --> 00:15:45,472
It's gonna be okay,
sweetie. Why...

295
00:15:45,485 --> 00:15:48,253
Why don't we make a
game out of it, okay?

296
00:15:48,265 --> 00:15:49,821
Why don't we sing along?

297
00:16:10,655 --> 00:16:12,553
If we get through this,

298
00:16:12,597 --> 00:16:16,033
I swear I'm gonna live
my life differently.

299
00:16:16,638 --> 00:16:20,342
I just want to tell my parents
I love them one more time.

300
00:16:21,698 --> 00:16:23,641
Morning, ladies.

301
00:16:24,867 --> 00:16:28,603
- It's him. It's the car guy!
- Get out of here!

302
00:16:37,758 --> 00:16:41,242
The next morning, Robin was too tired
to go all the way back to Brooklyn,

303
00:16:41,258 --> 00:16:42,571
so while I was at work,

304
00:16:42,586 --> 00:16:45,151
she went to crash at my
apartment for a couple hours,

305
00:16:45,635 --> 00:16:47,473
and that's when...

306
00:16:47,586 --> 00:16:49,953
Nobody does it better than you.

307
00:16:49,968 --> 00:16:51,610
Marshall?! Oh, my God!

308
00:16:53,176 --> 00:16:56,173
So if Lily hadn't dragged me
down to the wedding dress store,

309
00:16:56,187 --> 00:16:57,882
we would have made
the first flight.

310
00:16:57,938 --> 00:17:00,570
Oh, thank God.
The doors are still open. We made it.

311
00:17:00,717 --> 00:17:04,682
Hi. Please.
We really need to get on this flight.

312
00:17:04,797 --> 00:17:06,750
Oh, my God!

313
00:17:06,767 --> 00:17:09,183
You're that reporter
from Metro News 1.

314
00:17:09,195 --> 00:17:10,943
Yes, yes, I am.

315
00:17:10,956 --> 00:17:12,923
I can't believe
you recognized me.

316
00:17:12,937 --> 00:17:15,332
- You did that story on the giant pizzas?
- Would you check to see

317
00:17:15,367 --> 00:17:17,660
- if you have any more seats?
- One moment, sir.

318
00:17:18,217 --> 00:17:20,643
Were those pizzas real?
Come on, were they?

319
00:17:20,978 --> 00:17:22,883
- Robin...
- One second, Ted.

320
00:17:22,897 --> 00:17:24,963
Um, you know,
a lot of people ask me that.

321
00:17:24,978 --> 00:17:27,293
The truth is,
the pizzas were real.

322
00:17:27,307 --> 00:17:30,373
- Calzones. Trick photography.
- I knew it!

323
00:17:30,388 --> 00:17:33,373
God, it is so nice
to meet a fan!

324
00:17:33,675 --> 00:17:36,700
And I would be a fan of your
work if you could get us

325
00:17:36,716 --> 00:17:38,402
two seats on that next flight.

326
00:17:38,415 --> 00:17:43,263
Well, the, uh, flight attendants are
just finishing up their final
seat count.

327
00:17:43,355 --> 00:17:45,203
Let me see what I can find out.

328
00:17:45,217 --> 00:17:47,933
Would it help if I got on and gave an
impassioned speech about my destiny?

329
00:17:47,968 --> 00:17:49,472
I think it might hurt.

330
00:17:52,727 --> 00:17:54,891
This is such a nightmare.

331
00:17:55,808 --> 00:17:59,020
Okay, so we agree? This goes
back to Lily wanting to camp out

332
00:17:59,038 --> 00:18:00,332
for a wedding dress?

333
00:18:01,047 --> 00:18:02,133
No.

334
00:18:02,265 --> 00:18:04,150
Wait. It goes back further.

335
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:07,100
Remember why we were eating
hot dogs on the East Side?

336
00:18:17,188 --> 00:18:19,733
1939?!

337
00:18:20,207 --> 00:18:22,791
This penny's from 1939!

338
00:18:24,435 --> 00:18:27,581
A 67-year-old penny.

339
00:18:27,595 --> 00:18:30,510
Do you realize this penny was
minted during World War II?

340
00:18:30,525 --> 00:18:33,840
Oh, so was my grandfather,
but that doesn't make him interesting.

341
00:18:34,125 --> 00:18:36,651
Look, I know a little
something about coins,

342
00:18:36,668 --> 00:18:38,692
and this baby is worth
something to a collector.

343
00:18:38,705 --> 00:18:40,841
- No, it's not.
- Yes, it is!

344
00:18:40,858 --> 00:18:43,141
You know what?
I'm gonna take you out to dinner

345
00:18:43,157 --> 00:18:44,883
with the money I get
for this little guy.

346
00:18:44,897 --> 00:18:47,350
And that's exactly what I did.

347
00:18:47,367 --> 00:18:50,972
You're lucky there's still a place that
serves anything for a dollar fifty.

348
00:18:50,987 --> 00:18:54,040
Hey, that's 150 times
its original value.

349
00:18:54,078 --> 00:18:57,590
Actually, the meal
was only $1.49.

350
00:18:58,498 --> 00:19:00,111
1984.

351
00:19:00,127 --> 00:19:02,923
Hey, in 50 years,
we can get dinner again.

352
00:19:03,028 --> 00:19:04,480
How dare you.

353
00:19:05,028 --> 00:19:06,391
Hey, what's going on?

354
00:19:06,406 --> 00:19:08,081
I don't know. Looks like they're
camping out for something.

355
00:19:08,116 --> 00:19:09,581
Yeah, but for what?

356
00:19:10,376 --> 00:19:11,781
It was me.

357
00:19:11,926 --> 00:19:13,713
I started this.

358
00:19:13,778 --> 00:19:15,642
If I hadn't picked
up that penny,

359
00:19:15,655 --> 00:19:18,522
we wouldn't have gone to get hot
dogs all the way across town.

360
00:19:18,537 --> 00:19:20,981
And we wouldn't have seen
that wedding dress store,

361
00:19:20,998 --> 00:19:22,942
Lily wouldn't have wanted
to camp out there,

362
00:19:22,955 --> 00:19:26,163
and I wouldn't have needed a nap
at your apartment the next day.

363
00:19:26,175 --> 00:19:28,423
Marshall wouldn't
have broken his toe.

364
00:19:28,455 --> 00:19:30,583
Barney wouldn't have
run the marathon.

365
00:19:30,595 --> 00:19:32,603
I wouldn't have jumped
that turnstile,

366
00:19:32,616 --> 00:19:35,120
gotten arrested,
had that court date...

367
00:19:35,205 --> 00:19:37,200
And we would have
made our flight.

368
00:19:37,856 --> 00:19:39,880
I don't think we can go
back any further than that

369
00:19:39,896 --> 00:19:41,630
unless you know who
dropped the penny.

370
00:19:41,646 --> 00:19:43,060
I wish I did.

371
00:19:43,075 --> 00:19:44,963
Though that person's already
been punished enough,

372
00:19:44,995 --> 00:19:47,660
losing a sweet penny like that.

373
00:19:47,987 --> 00:19:49,541
Uh, sir?

374
00:19:49,645 --> 00:19:52,253
Oh, please tell me you
have some good news.

375
00:19:52,268 --> 00:19:54,061
Uh, I'm afraid not.

376
00:19:54,077 --> 00:19:56,130
There are no extra
seats on the plane.

377
00:19:56,148 --> 00:19:57,432
I'm sorry.

378
00:19:57,445 --> 00:19:59,302
All, right, well,
thanks for trying.

379
00:20:00,068 --> 00:20:01,322
I can't believe this.

380
00:20:01,337 --> 00:20:04,111
That's it, it's over.

381
00:20:04,127 --> 00:20:05,631
Ted, come on.

382
00:20:05,648 --> 00:20:09,022
Your destiny just wasn't to 
make it to Chicago today.

383
00:20:09,036 --> 00:20:11,973
Anyway, if that firm really wants you,
they'll reschedule.

384
00:20:12,326 --> 00:20:13,843
But that's not what happened.

385
00:20:13,858 --> 00:20:15,653
They didn't reschedule.

386
00:20:15,667 --> 00:20:17,531
They hired someone else.

387
00:20:17,548 --> 00:20:20,081
And as it turned out,
three months later,

388
00:20:20,095 --> 00:20:23,370
that guy ended up having
to relocate to Chicago.

389
00:20:23,626 --> 00:20:25,760
Kids, funny thing
about destiny--

390
00:20:25,776 --> 00:20:28,243
I  thought I was destined
to get that job.

391
00:20:28,257 --> 00:20:29,571
But I was wrong.

392
00:20:29,588 --> 00:20:32,152
My destiny was to
stay in New York.

393
00:20:32,486 --> 00:20:34,412
Because if I hadn't,

394
00:20:34,426 --> 00:20:36,572
I never would have
met your mother.

395
00:21:03,506 --> 00:21:07,520
