1
00:00:00,718 --> 00:00:04,056
Marshall and Lily had been
together for nine wonderful years,

2
00:00:04,066 --> 00:00:06,826
until she dumped him and
ran off to San Francisco.

3
00:00:07,566 --> 00:00:10,211
The healing process
was taking a long time.

4
00:00:11,601 --> 00:00:14,453
Then, one night,
he made a giant leap forward.

5
00:00:14,463 --> 00:00:16,091
All right,
I'll see you guys later.

6
00:00:16,101 --> 00:00:17,230
I'll walk you out.

7
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:18,474
See ya.

8
00:00:22,764 --> 00:00:24,855
You just checked
out Robin's ass.

9
00:00:24,865 --> 00:00:26,937
What? No! No, Barney, I was...

10
00:00:26,946 --> 00:00:28,943
Dude, that's awesome.

11
00:00:28,952 --> 00:00:32,039
You're finally forgetting
about that short redhead.

12
00:00:32,117 --> 00:00:32,783
Lily.

13
00:00:32,796 --> 00:00:35,973
Yes, Lily. Thank you. That was
going to drive me crazy all night.

14
00:00:35,985 --> 00:00:38,223
Hey, Ted, Marshall just checked
out your girlfriend's ass.

15
00:00:38,255 --> 00:00:40,871
- I did not, Ted, I...
- That's awesome.

16
00:00:40,886 --> 00:00:42,291
You're finally getting better.

17
00:00:42,306 --> 00:00:44,170
This is the moment
I've been waiting for.

18
00:00:44,188 --> 00:00:47,612
Starting tonight,
I am going to teach you how to live.

19
00:00:47,628 --> 00:00:49,590
Ted, you had your chance.
You're out; Marshall's in.

20
00:00:49,605 --> 00:00:50,943
- Yes!
- Oh, God.

21
00:00:50,957 --> 00:00:54,791
Marshall, being a single guy
in New York City is like...

22
00:00:55,617 --> 00:00:57,240
What's something
everybody likes?

23
00:00:57,256 --> 00:00:58,260
Candy.

24
00:00:58,277 --> 00:01:00,800
Yes, it's like being
in a candy store.

25
00:01:00,815 --> 00:01:04,120
You just walk right in and
grab yourself some Whoppers.

26
00:01:04,558 --> 00:01:06,000
Yeah.

27
00:01:06,537 --> 00:01:08,103
Is Whoppers the best one?

28
00:01:08,118 --> 00:01:09,190
Mounds.

29
00:01:09,207 --> 00:01:10,522
Milk Duds.

30
00:01:10,545 --> 00:01:12,170
Gobstoppers.

31
00:01:12,995 --> 00:01:15,213
This went on for another hour;

32
00:01:15,226 --> 00:01:16,690
I'll just skip to the end.

33
00:01:16,705 --> 00:01:18,731
- Dubble Bubbles.
- Nice!

34
00:01:18,745 --> 00:01:20,452
Marshall. We're doing this.

35
00:01:20,465 --> 00:01:22,391
I am not taking
no for an answer.

36
00:01:22,408 --> 00:01:23,670
Fine.

37
00:01:23,687 --> 00:01:25,792
Hey, Robin.
Marshall checked out your ass.

38
00:01:25,808 --> 00:01:27,341
Ted, what is wrong with you?

39
00:01:27,356 --> 00:01:29,011
He checked out my ass.

40
00:01:29,026 --> 00:01:32,550
Hey, tell him thanks.
I felt like I was having a bad ass day.

41
00:01:32,566 --> 00:01:34,522
Cool, see ya.

42
00:01:37,658 --> 00:01:39,130
Lily.

43
00:01:39,266 --> 00:01:41,432
It is a great ass.

44
00:01:54,966 --> 00:01:57,381
None of us had seen
Lily in three months.

45
00:01:57,398 --> 00:01:59,390
There were so many
unanswered questions,

46
00:01:59,406 --> 00:02:01,010
so many things to say.

47
00:02:01,028 --> 00:02:03,721
Your hair is adorable.

48
00:02:05,416 --> 00:02:08,320
Meanwhile, Barney was taking
Marshall out to meet women

49
00:02:08,335 --> 00:02:10,883
for the first time
since he was 17.

50
00:02:10,895 --> 00:02:13,151
Hi. Have you met Marshall?

51
00:02:13,895 --> 00:02:15,353
- Hi.
- Hi.

52
00:02:17,147 --> 00:02:19,521
Look how sweaty my hands are.

53
00:02:20,395 --> 00:02:22,980
It's weird, right? Uh, sweat?

54
00:02:22,996 --> 00:02:26,961
Like, this smelly water
coming out of your skin.

55
00:02:28,916 --> 00:02:30,702
It was nice meeting you.

56
00:02:30,715 --> 00:02:33,462
I-I-I hate to interrupt,
but, uh,

57
00:02:33,475 --> 00:02:35,353
do you like magic?

58
00:02:35,365 --> 00:02:37,431
Um, I guess.

59
00:02:39,178 --> 00:02:41,760
Oh, my God!

60
00:02:45,936 --> 00:02:48,480
Anyway, Marshall
here is awesome.

61
00:02:48,496 --> 00:02:50,760
Salad in a bag? His idea.

62
00:02:50,936 --> 00:02:53,692
Dude! You were
awesome last night.

63
00:02:53,708 --> 00:02:55,412
You were charming,
you were funny,

64
00:02:55,426 --> 00:02:57,160
you were totally
working that girl.

65
00:02:57,176 --> 00:02:58,563
You went home with her.

66
00:02:58,577 --> 00:03:00,421
Yes, I did.

67
00:03:00,745 --> 00:03:03,721
But she told me that
if it wasn't for me,

68
00:03:03,735 --> 00:03:05,261
you would have had
a shot with her,

69
00:03:05,276 --> 00:03:08,123
so, in hypothetical terms,
you scored last night.

70
00:03:08,137 --> 00:03:09,361
All right!

71
00:03:09,378 --> 00:03:11,240
Hypothetical high five.

72
00:03:12,746 --> 00:03:14,241
Nice.

73
00:03:14,258 --> 00:03:16,580
All right.
Tonight, we're going to go to the bar...

74
00:03:16,596 --> 00:03:19,333
Barney, no,
I am not going out with you ever again.

75
00:03:19,347 --> 00:03:22,142
Come on! I'll,
I'll teach you all of my strategies.

76
00:03:22,158 --> 00:03:22,933
Oh, really?

77
00:03:22,947 --> 00:03:25,080
My favorite, number seven:

78
00:03:25,098 --> 00:03:26,990
create a mystery
about yourself.

79
00:03:27,007 --> 00:03:30,771
That way, they become so intrigued, they
have to hang out with you all night.

80
00:03:30,787 --> 00:03:32,823
Oh, come on,
does that really work?

81
00:03:32,837 --> 00:03:35,843
Maybe  it does,
and maybe it doesn't.

82
00:03:38,308 --> 00:03:40,952
Damn it, that's intriguing.
Okay, I'm in.

83
00:03:43,966 --> 00:03:46,103
- I have something you've got to hear.
- You will not believe what just happened.

84
00:03:46,116 --> 00:03:47,712
You go first.

85
00:03:48,755 --> 00:03:51,622
I found a 1939d
penny on the subway.

86
00:03:51,696 --> 00:03:54,603
Just imagine the kind of history
this little copper guy...

87
00:03:54,617 --> 00:03:56,262
Lily's back in town.

88
00:03:56,406 --> 00:03:58,902
And you let me go first?

89
00:03:58,918 --> 00:03:59,882
Have you seen her?

90
00:03:59,895 --> 00:04:03,371
Yeah. I actually went
apartment-hunting with her today.

91
00:04:03,387 --> 00:04:04,941
How's she doing?

92
00:04:04,958 --> 00:04:06,690
You're not going to like it.

93
00:04:06,956 --> 00:04:09,213
I am doing great.

94
00:04:09,227 --> 00:04:11,362
This summer, best thing ever!

95
00:04:11,375 --> 00:04:14,132
San Francisco is so
happening right now.

96
00:04:14,146 --> 00:04:15,690
She's happy?!

97
00:04:15,707 --> 00:04:19,012
Marshall had the worst summer
of his life, and she's happy.

98
00:04:19,645 --> 00:04:23,442
Yeah, and I suppose her art program
was all fulfilling or whatever.

99
00:04:23,458 --> 00:04:27,163
Oh. The art program--
best thing ever.

100
00:04:27,277 --> 00:04:29,091
Oh, my God.

101
00:04:29,105 --> 00:04:30,973
This is your best work.

102
00:04:30,985 --> 00:04:34,141
In all my years teaching,
I've never seen anything so...

103
00:04:34,606 --> 00:04:38,841
Needless to say, this is art.

104
00:04:39,868 --> 00:04:42,183
I can't teach you anything.

105
00:04:45,628 --> 00:04:47,642
But the best part of S.F.--

106
00:04:47,655 --> 00:04:49,832
Oh, that's what we
call San Francisco--

107
00:04:49,845 --> 00:04:50,970
the people.

108
00:04:50,986 --> 00:04:53,233
Even just riding around
on the bus all summer.

109
00:04:53,246 --> 00:04:56,593
It was like a human tapestry.

110
00:04:56,717 --> 00:04:58,231
Hi, I'm Mike.

111
00:04:58,247 --> 00:05:01,313
I'm a Buddhist monk slash
adventure-traveler writer.

112
00:05:01,426 --> 00:05:04,862
I'm Paula.
I sing in a punk band for children.

113
00:05:04,877 --> 00:05:06,191
Yeah.

114
00:05:06,207 --> 00:05:08,000
I'm Dan, I'm a neurosurgeon.

115
00:05:08,016 --> 00:05:10,232
You are stunning, by the way.

116
00:05:12,526 --> 00:05:15,081
Wow. I'm so happy for you.

117
00:05:15,098 --> 00:05:17,672
Oh, she's such a...

118
00:05:19,308 --> 00:05:22,722
After what she did to Marshall,
she should come back here devastated,

119
00:05:22,735 --> 00:05:26,481
crawling on all fours over the broken
glass of her own shame and regret.

120
00:05:26,498 --> 00:05:28,820
You never chose sides.
I respect that.

121
00:05:28,837 --> 00:05:30,583
She's unbelievable.
Unbelievable.

122
00:05:30,596 --> 00:05:32,991
Unbelievable?
What's unbelievable?

123
00:05:33,006 --> 00:05:34,353
Oh. Listen, Marshall.

124
00:05:34,366 --> 00:05:38,301
Ted found a penny on the subway,
and it's old, and that's interesting.

125
00:05:41,366 --> 00:05:42,952
Way to go.

126
00:05:45,835 --> 00:05:48,691
Okay, first of all,
that is interesting.

127
00:05:48,707 --> 00:05:50,163
Second,  we have to tell him.

128
00:05:50,177 --> 00:05:53,843
No, we don't. He's just starting to
get better, going out with Barney.

129
00:05:53,858 --> 00:05:57,113
I  mean, how do you think he's going to
feel when he hears Lily's moved on?

130
00:05:57,125 --> 00:05:59,471
- She's moved on?
- It happens.

131
00:05:59,485 --> 00:06:01,591
I've fallen out of love
faster than that before,

132
00:06:01,607 --> 00:06:04,213
sometimes, boom,
with no warning whatsoever.

133
00:06:04,225 --> 00:06:07,283
One day we're in love,
the next day, he's dead to me.

134
00:06:08,277 --> 00:06:10,472
But we're great.

135
00:06:10,486 --> 00:06:12,192
Honey.

136
00:06:14,757 --> 00:06:17,660
Now, let's review Barney's
rules for mating without dating.

137
00:06:17,677 --> 00:06:20,213
Lesson two, corollary five.

138
00:06:20,227 --> 00:06:23,591
Make a beautiful woman feel
self-conscious and unattractive

139
00:06:23,606 --> 00:06:24,960
and she'll be putty
in your hands.

140
00:06:24,966 --> 00:06:27,422
Excellent. Have you
chosen your entree?

141
00:06:27,437 --> 00:06:30,281
I have.
Sweet brunette, eight o'clock.

142
00:06:30,295 --> 00:06:32,063
Nine o'clock. Ten... thirty.

143
00:06:32,077 --> 00:06:33,831
She's walking to the bar.

144
00:06:34,762 --> 00:06:36,679
- Her? Really?
- Yeah.

145
00:06:36,687 --> 00:06:39,743
No, you're right.
Ambition is the enemy of success.

146
00:06:39,756 --> 00:06:41,453
Okay. Hit it.

147
00:06:45,415 --> 00:06:47,822
What's the matter, four eyes,
you got astigmatism or something?

148
00:06:47,838 --> 00:06:49,752
I'm sorry,
I was trying to playfully disarm you,

149
00:06:49,788 --> 00:06:51,230
but I just got out of
a long relationship.

150
00:06:51,265 --> 00:06:53,473
I have no idea what I'm doing.

151
00:06:54,326 --> 00:06:55,322
I'm Marshall.

152
00:06:55,338 --> 00:06:57,603
Hi, Marshall. Amy.

153
00:06:57,615 --> 00:06:59,490
Don't worry. I've been there.

154
00:06:59,505 --> 00:07:00,970
Hold on.

155
00:07:00,988 --> 00:07:03,152
Nice recovery.
I think it's working.

156
00:07:03,165 --> 00:07:05,931
Um, Amy.
This is my friend, Barney.

157
00:07:05,946 --> 00:07:07,811
Barney, this is Amy.

158
00:07:07,828 --> 00:07:09,692
Hi, Barney. Nice to meet you.

159
00:07:09,708 --> 00:07:11,140
Hi.

160
00:07:11,876 --> 00:07:15,490
Amy, do you like... magic?

161
00:07:15,505 --> 00:07:18,413
- I hate you.
- I am so sorry.

162
00:07:18,427 --> 00:07:21,560
It's a sickness.
I'm the real victim here.

163
00:07:21,575 --> 00:07:22,772
Twice.

164
00:07:22,788 --> 00:07:26,553
Twice in a row, you took my candy.
That was my candy.

165
00:07:26,567 --> 00:07:29,691
- I know, but tonight...
- No. Forget it.

166
00:07:29,708 --> 00:07:32,183
You're such a jackass.

167
00:07:34,766 --> 00:07:36,993
I thought you were
gonna call me a jerk.

168
00:07:37,878 --> 00:07:40,573
All right, I'm sorry.
I will make it up to you.

169
00:07:40,588 --> 00:07:43,523
Tonight, we'll go to a
college bar near NYU--

170
00:07:43,537 --> 00:07:45,443
The Scorpion and the Toad.

171
00:07:45,455 --> 00:07:48,771
I figure in a younger crowd you'll
seem more mature, more worldly

172
00:07:48,786 --> 00:07:52,290
and, as a third-year
law student, more smarter.

173
00:07:56,428 --> 00:07:58,720
Okay, but no magic.

174
00:08:01,298 --> 00:08:03,010
How did you do that?

175
00:08:03,025 --> 00:08:05,161
I'm taking a leak, dumb ass.

176
00:08:06,957 --> 00:08:10,230
The next day, Robin and I went
apartment-hunting with aunt Lily.

177
00:08:10,247 --> 00:08:12,913
But I need the freedom to
really chase my passion,

178
00:08:12,928 --> 00:08:15,172
which was painting,
but now I think it's music

179
00:08:15,188 --> 00:08:17,080
or spoken word-- maybe both.

180
00:08:17,098 --> 00:08:19,252
God! Isn't life amazing?

181
00:08:19,266 --> 00:08:21,952
It is so great to see you, Ted.

182
00:08:22,118 --> 00:08:24,933
I'm going to get the
key from the lockbox.

183
00:08:27,756 --> 00:08:28,710
What?

184
00:08:28,725 --> 00:08:31,493
She's miserable. She's realized
she's made a huge mistake.

185
00:08:31,508 --> 00:08:33,902
Her and Marshall will be back
together in a week. I love it!

186
00:08:33,917 --> 00:08:36,090
Um, no.
You just want Lily to be miserable.

187
00:08:36,107 --> 00:08:37,382
The truth is, she's happy.

188
00:08:37,396 --> 00:08:39,423
Trust me.
I've known Lily for nine years.

189
00:08:39,437 --> 00:08:40,681
Trust me. I'm a girl.

190
00:08:40,698 --> 00:08:42,553
Yeah, but you're Canadian.

191
00:08:42,565 --> 00:08:44,873
- Why do you always have to bring that up?
- You're our weird neighbors to the north.

192
00:08:44,905 --> 00:08:49,011
- You bring it up every time.
- Five bucks says she still wants Marshall.

193
00:08:49,026 --> 00:08:50,302
You're on.

194
00:08:50,317 --> 00:08:51,822
Five American bucks.

195
00:08:51,837 --> 00:08:53,481
Damn it.

196
00:08:53,608 --> 00:08:55,853
Okay, so how do we get
the truth out of her.

197
00:08:55,868 --> 00:08:57,771
Tequila. It's her weakness.

198
00:08:57,787 --> 00:09:00,383
Three shots, she'll tell you
the truth about anything.

199
00:09:00,727 --> 00:09:03,622
I hope this is my new home.

200
00:09:05,986 --> 00:09:09,111
Yeah, I'm going to take
that first apartment.

201
00:09:10,277 --> 00:09:12,291
Marshall Eriksen, suit up!

202
00:09:12,308 --> 00:09:13,050
No way.

203
00:09:13,067 --> 00:09:14,723
Yeah, you're good in that.

204
00:09:14,738 --> 00:09:16,820
- Let's go.
- Wait.

205
00:09:16,837 --> 00:09:18,633
Empty your pockets.

206
00:09:19,555 --> 00:09:20,873
Come on.

207
00:09:26,068 --> 00:09:28,340
- Come on, let's...
- Sleeves.

208
00:09:28,358 --> 00:09:31,380
- There is nothing in my...
- Oh, is that right?

209
00:09:38,565 --> 00:09:40,080
Let's go.

210
00:09:40,505 --> 00:09:44,670
- Behind my ear.
- There is nothing behind your...

211
00:09:50,208 --> 00:09:52,892
Yeah, I'm in pre-law.
The workload's killing me, though.

212
00:09:52,908 --> 00:09:56,290
Oh, tell me about it.
I'm third year at Columbia Law, so...

213
00:09:56,308 --> 00:09:59,590
if the workload does kill you,
I can probably get a conviction.

214
00:10:00,625 --> 00:10:02,052
Yeah.

215
00:10:02,067 --> 00:10:04,050
You must be majoring
in chemistry,

216
00:10:04,067 --> 00:10:07,153
'cause what I'm picking
up between us is, uh...

217
00:10:07,848 --> 00:10:10,432
College lesbian phase.

218
00:10:13,976 --> 00:10:17,953
Listen, I got to go,
but it'd be great to see you again.

219
00:10:18,108 --> 00:10:20,273
Yes, it would.

220
00:10:20,505 --> 00:10:22,592
It really would.

221
00:10:23,215 --> 00:10:25,763
Well, maybe I'll see
you here sometime.

222
00:10:25,888 --> 00:10:28,631
Probably not.
I'm never here, so...

223
00:10:28,856 --> 00:10:30,773
You know,
I do have a phone number.

224
00:10:30,787 --> 00:10:32,391
Great.

225
00:10:32,785 --> 00:10:34,511
Nice.

226
00:10:34,627 --> 00:10:36,961
- Hi, I'm Barney.
- Oh, no.

227
00:10:36,977 --> 00:10:40,751
Do you... mind giving my friend 
your phone number?

228
00:10:40,768 --> 00:10:42,441
Sure.

229
00:10:44,177 --> 00:10:45,761
Whoo!

230
00:10:45,778 --> 00:10:48,591
I did it!
I got a girl's phone number.

231
00:10:48,607 --> 00:10:51,043
Oh, and her handwriting
is so cute, look.

232
00:10:51,058 --> 00:10:52,673
Oh, I'm gonna take her
out for Chinesr food

233
00:10:52,708 --> 00:10:54,192
and then maybe we'll
walk through the park.

234
00:10:54,228 --> 00:10:56,512
It'll be so... what?

235
00:10:56,747 --> 00:10:59,723
Sorry, buddy,
I'm taking this one, too.

236
00:11:04,456 --> 00:11:06,040
I'll kill you!

237
00:11:06,056 --> 00:11:08,512
And  then, I discovered this area,
North Beach.

238
00:11:08,527 --> 00:11:10,303
Best beach ever!

239
00:11:10,318 --> 00:11:13,652
Oh, I've been blabbering
on about my summer.

240
00:11:13,666 --> 00:11:15,373
How are you guys doing?

241
00:11:15,385 --> 00:11:17,093
And hey, how's Marshall?

242
00:11:17,107 --> 00:11:18,992
- Give me the card!
- I'm not giving you any card.

243
00:11:19,026 --> 00:11:20,440
- I swear...!
- You are not getting...!

244
00:11:20,478 --> 00:11:21,722
Terrific.

245
00:11:21,738 --> 00:11:24,633
That is so good to hear.
Oh, hold on.

246
00:11:24,646 --> 00:11:27,360
This could be about
the apartment.

247
00:11:27,898 --> 00:11:29,951
Okay, we're way
past truth-telling-Lilly

248
00:11:29,968 --> 00:11:32,271
and about to
hit Cinco-de-Mayo-1998-Lilly

249
00:11:32,285 --> 00:11:34,210
and I'm not cleaning
that up again.

250
00:11:34,227 --> 00:11:37,332
So, congratulations, you win.

251
00:11:37,345 --> 00:11:39,373
She's happy.

252
00:11:39,386 --> 00:11:41,162
I didn't get it.

253
00:11:41,317 --> 00:11:43,683
That first apartment, I...

254
00:11:43,695 --> 00:11:45,810
I waited too long and...

255
00:11:45,827 --> 00:11:48,283
somebody else got it.

256
00:11:51,128 --> 00:11:53,510
Interesting.

257
00:11:53,826 --> 00:11:55,600
Wow, Lily, you, uh...

258
00:11:55,617 --> 00:11:58,553
seem to be having a pretty strong
reaction on losing an apartment.

259
00:11:58,567 --> 00:12:01,591
I wonder if it's because it reminds
you of something else you lost

260
00:12:01,606 --> 00:12:03,871
because you couldn't commit.

261
00:12:03,885 --> 00:12:06,701
No, Lily,
you're crying over the crown molding

262
00:12:06,718 --> 00:12:09,961
and the real hardwood floors.
There's no deeper meaning.

263
00:12:09,976 --> 00:12:12,951
Right, Lily?
Just quit crying and tell him.

264
00:12:13,898 --> 00:12:18,952
The apartment is a
metaphor for Marshall.

265
00:12:22,425 --> 00:12:23,971
- Stop it!
- You don't want to see...

266
00:12:23,987 --> 00:12:25,493
- ..what I'm like when I'm angry.
- It's my card!

267
00:12:25,507 --> 00:12:27,040
Stop! Hold on!

268
00:12:27,056 --> 00:12:28,773
If we can't settle
this like gentlemen,

269
00:12:28,787 --> 00:12:29,922
then no one gets the number.

270
00:12:29,936 --> 00:12:32,761
- No! Stop the cab.
- Wha...?

271
00:12:33,886 --> 00:12:37,123
No, wait. Come on. Marshall!

272
00:12:37,137 --> 00:12:39,383
81st and First, please.

273
00:12:42,015 --> 00:12:45,110
Ah,  she does have
cute handwriting.

274
00:12:46,078 --> 00:12:47,560
The thing about a hangover

275
00:12:47,577 --> 00:12:50,012
is that everyone has
their own special remedy.

276
00:12:50,025 --> 00:12:51,253
Morning, guys.
What can I get you?

277
00:12:51,285 --> 00:12:52,513
Shh!

278
00:12:52,526 --> 00:12:55,571
Bring me the dirtiest,
greasiest tuna melt you got.

279
00:12:55,588 --> 00:12:57,272
And a milkshake.

280
00:12:57,285 --> 00:12:58,890
For you, sir?

281
00:12:59,628 --> 00:13:01,183
Gravy.

282
00:13:02,305 --> 00:13:04,730
You want that
gravy on something?

283
00:13:04,746 --> 00:13:06,512
Surprise me.

284
00:13:06,525 --> 00:13:10,552
I'd take you with gravy if my
boyfriend wasn't sitting right here.

285
00:13:10,566 --> 00:13:13,023
Just kidding. I'm good.

286
00:13:14,246 --> 00:13:16,503
What are you so chirpy about?

287
00:13:16,517 --> 00:13:18,570
She's still drunk
from last night.

288
00:13:18,586 --> 00:13:20,442
I don't think so.

289
00:13:20,455 --> 00:13:22,641
Whoo!

290
00:13:24,656 --> 00:13:27,061
Look, if you want
Marshall back so bad,

291
00:13:27,077 --> 00:13:29,532
how come it took you two
days to even ask about him?

292
00:13:29,546 --> 00:13:33,223
I was dying to ask.
I was just trying to play it cool.

293
00:13:33,237 --> 00:13:34,543
But really...

294
00:13:34,557 --> 00:13:36,350
But it's good, I mean,
work is great...

295
00:13:36,366 --> 00:13:38,350
Come on, say something about Marshall.
Where's Marshall?

296
00:13:38,387 --> 00:13:40,042
How's Marshall?
What's Marshall doing right now?

297
00:13:40,077 --> 00:13:42,481
Shut up and talk about Marshall.
Shut up and talk about Marshall.

298
00:13:42,517 --> 00:13:44,821
Shut up and talk about Marshall.
Marshall, Marshall,

299
00:13:44,836 --> 00:13:47,290
Marshall, Marshall...
I've got to ask!

300
00:13:47,306 --> 00:13:49,493
And hey, how's Marshall?

301
00:13:49,508 --> 00:13:51,350
It was such an awful summer.

302
00:13:51,365 --> 00:13:53,873
I just wanted to get
back here and see him.

303
00:13:53,887 --> 00:13:56,043
But I thought your
summer was great.

304
00:13:56,056 --> 00:13:58,072
Not exactly.

305
00:13:58,087 --> 00:14:00,473
Oh, my God.

306
00:14:00,516 --> 00:14:03,173
This is you best work?

307
00:14:03,497 --> 00:14:08,162
In all my years teaching,
I've never seen anything so needless.

308
00:14:08,177 --> 00:14:11,950
To say this is... art...

309
00:14:13,297 --> 00:14:15,572
I can't teach you anything.

310
00:14:16,358 --> 00:14:20,811
So all those interesting
people you met on the bus?

311
00:14:20,828 --> 00:14:22,453
Yeah, um...

312
00:14:22,505 --> 00:14:24,461
Hi. I'm Mike.

313
00:14:24,476 --> 00:14:28,270
I'm a Buddhist monk slash
adventure travel writer.

314
00:14:28,286 --> 00:14:33,013
I'm Paula.
I sing in a punk band for children.

315
00:14:33,028 --> 00:14:39,342
Hey, I'm Dan. I'm a neurosurgeon.
You are stunning, by the way.

316
00:14:39,985 --> 00:14:43,003
I never got in touch because
I was too embarrassed.

317
00:14:43,018 --> 00:14:44,710
I screwed everything up.

318
00:14:44,727 --> 00:14:47,793
I have no job,
no place to live.

319
00:14:47,817 --> 00:14:50,843
I lost the love of my life.

320
00:14:51,078 --> 00:14:54,331
I know I have no right
to ask this, but...

321
00:14:54,348 --> 00:14:56,812
do you think Marshall
would take me back?

322
00:14:56,827 --> 00:14:58,171
In a heartbeat.

323
00:14:58,188 --> 00:15:01,853
If you called him up, yeah,
he'd take you back with open arms.

324
00:15:01,865 --> 00:15:04,940
Wow. So maybe 
I should call him.

325
00:15:04,956 --> 00:15:06,413
Maybe.

326
00:15:06,787 --> 00:15:09,451
No! This is... Ow!

327
00:15:10,597 --> 00:15:11,790
Hold on.

328
00:15:11,808 --> 00:15:14,211
Look, if you're going
to go back to him,

329
00:15:14,225 --> 00:15:15,360
I don't want to hear
the word "maybe."

330
00:15:15,378 --> 00:15:17,503
"Maybe" cannot be
in your vocabulary.

331
00:15:17,518 --> 00:15:19,312
This breakup almost killed him.

332
00:15:19,328 --> 00:15:21,670
And he cannot go
through it again.

333
00:15:21,685 --> 00:15:26,701
So, unless you're absolutely certain,
stay the hell away from him.

334
00:15:30,226 --> 00:15:32,850
This guy likes pennies.

335
00:15:35,766 --> 00:15:36,671
Hi, Marshall.

336
00:15:36,687 --> 00:15:38,840
No, go away.
I don't want to talk to you.

337
00:15:38,858 --> 00:15:44,060
Okay, I know what I did a couple
nights back is in a moral gray area.

338
00:15:44,077 --> 00:15:47,491
But the great news is,
she loved you.

339
00:15:47,505 --> 00:15:49,723
If things had gone your way--
you'd gone out a couple times,

340
00:15:49,756 --> 00:15:52,033
I think she definitely
would have had sex with you.

341
00:15:52,048 --> 00:15:54,591
There's no "would" in sex.

342
00:15:56,295 --> 00:15:59,792
You're right, I totally...
I'm just no good at this, Barney.

343
00:15:59,808 --> 00:16:02,931
I'm good at being in a couple,
I'm good at being Lily's boyfriend.

344
00:16:02,947 --> 00:16:05,010
Being single-- forget it.

345
00:16:05,026 --> 00:16:06,573
Come on, you can't give up now.

346
00:16:06,585 --> 00:16:08,841
What if I told you that
you could relive that night

347
00:16:08,856 --> 00:16:11,661
with the exact same conversations,
the exact same jokes

348
00:16:11,677 --> 00:16:15,061
only this time,
you get her and I don't.

349
00:16:15,075 --> 00:16:16,233
That's not possible.

350
00:16:16,247 --> 00:16:17,693
Oh, but it is.

351
00:16:17,706 --> 00:16:19,352
She has...

352
00:16:19,367 --> 00:16:20,972
wait for it...

353
00:16:20,986 --> 00:16:22,611
here it comes...

354
00:16:22,627 --> 00:16:24,223
almost there...

355
00:16:24,238 --> 00:16:26,192
an identical twin.

356
00:16:26,207 --> 00:16:27,763
Yes!

357
00:16:27,977 --> 00:16:29,931
A twin isn't the same person.

358
00:16:29,946 --> 00:16:32,250
Of course it is.
What do you think identical means?

359
00:16:32,268 --> 00:16:35,321
"Ident"-- same, "ical"-- person. 
Same person.

360
00:16:35,735 --> 00:16:38,093
Hey, we could double date.

361
00:16:39,315 --> 00:16:40,652
Fine.

362
00:16:40,667 --> 00:16:43,812
But you have to promise me,
you're not going to steal my new twin,

363
00:16:43,827 --> 00:16:48,190
and  leave me with your old,
used-up twin.

364
00:16:48,268 --> 00:16:49,900
Used-up?

365
00:16:49,916 --> 00:16:52,700
They're a human being, 
Marshall.

366
00:16:54,265 --> 00:16:56,600
So Uncle Marshall and
Uncle Barney went out

367
00:16:56,617 --> 00:16:58,972
on a double date
with the twins.

368
00:16:59,688 --> 00:17:01,070
How you doing?

369
00:17:01,086 --> 00:17:03,873
Great. Amazing.
This is so much fun.

370
00:17:03,887 --> 00:17:05,603
And I think me and the
girl are really clicking.

371
00:17:05,638 --> 00:17:07,290
You are, you definitely are.

372
00:17:07,305 --> 00:17:09,452
Listen, you're going
to have to leave now.

373
00:17:09,466 --> 00:17:11,292
I just talked with the twins,
and get this,

374
00:17:11,308 --> 00:17:14,292
I'm going home
with both of them.

375
00:17:14,305 --> 00:17:17,512
Yeah. That's happening.

376
00:17:17,857 --> 00:17:20,680
It is impossible that you're
doing this to me again.

377
00:17:20,698 --> 00:17:23,142
But they're twins.

378
00:17:23,158 --> 00:17:25,412
You-- you said to me
that being single

379
00:17:25,426 --> 00:17:27,123
would be like being
in a candy store.

380
00:17:27,138 --> 00:17:28,990
Well, it's not,
it's not like a candy store.

381
00:17:29,005 --> 00:17:32,101
It's a lawless,
postapocalyptic wasteland.

382
00:17:32,117 --> 00:17:34,081
- I may be your best friend...
- Actually Ted's my best friend.

383
00:17:34,115 --> 00:17:37,832
But in this world,
it's every hombre for himself.

384
00:17:37,845 --> 00:17:39,871
That's what being single is.

385
00:17:39,887 --> 00:17:41,843
And after nine
years in captivity,

386
00:17:41,857 --> 00:17:43,943
that is the single greatest lesson 
I can teach you 

387
00:17:43,958 --> 00:17:46,053
about surviving in the wild.

388
00:17:46,066 --> 00:17:47,863
Now, if you'll excuse me...

389
00:17:47,878 --> 00:17:49,950
I have two unique breasts

390
00:17:49,968 --> 00:17:52,890
and two duplicates
waiting for me.

391
00:17:57,128 --> 00:17:59,802
Oh, bad news--
Marshall got food poisoning.

392
00:17:59,817 --> 00:18:00,910
- What?
- Oh, no.

393
00:18:00,925 --> 00:18:03,053
That's too bad.
I really liked him.

394
00:18:03,066 --> 00:18:07,360
Yeah. Well, I guess 
we're just a threesome tonight.

395
00:18:17,747 --> 00:18:20,702
Lily, what are you doing here?

396
00:18:20,718 --> 00:18:23,982
Oh, I was just walking by.
I wasn't...

397
00:18:24,015 --> 00:18:26,802
Oh, you mean New York?
My program ended.

398
00:18:26,816 --> 00:18:29,660
It was just great.
Just lots of fun...

399
00:18:29,676 --> 00:18:32,820
It was awful.
It was the worst mistake I ever made.

400
00:18:32,835 --> 00:18:36,222
I'm so sorry,
Marshall, and... hello.

401
00:18:38,507 --> 00:18:41,482
Lily, this was the
worst summer of my life.

402
00:18:41,497 --> 00:18:44,212
I know.
It was the worst summer of my life.

403
00:18:44,227 --> 00:18:47,240
It was the hardest thing that
I've ever had to go through.

404
00:18:48,417 --> 00:18:51,133
Can we please get
back together?

405
00:18:52,168 --> 00:18:55,390
All that crap you
said to me about,

406
00:18:55,406 --> 00:18:58,812
"we need to figure out
who we are outside of us,

407
00:18:58,828 --> 00:19:01,760
and we need to learn to
do things on our own,"

408
00:19:02,638 --> 00:19:04,850
it broke my heart.

409
00:19:06,296 --> 00:19:08,872
Three months ago,
you broke my heart.

410
00:19:10,738 --> 00:19:13,822
Can we please get
back together?

411
00:19:15,176 --> 00:19:17,153
Lily, you were right.

412
00:19:18,708 --> 00:19:21,090
All that crap was right.

413
00:19:22,566 --> 00:19:24,490
So, no.

414
00:19:24,936 --> 00:19:27,173
No, we can't get back together.

415
00:19:27,187 --> 00:19:28,921
We shouldn't.

416
00:19:29,118 --> 00:19:31,262
At least, not right now.

417
00:19:33,666 --> 00:19:35,300
Wow.

418
00:19:35,596 --> 00:19:37,280
Okay.

419
00:19:38,565 --> 00:19:40,303
Yeah.

420
00:19:41,957 --> 00:19:43,413
Well...

421
00:19:45,405 --> 00:19:48,001
Will we still see each other?

422
00:19:48,475 --> 00:19:50,571
Yeah, yeah.

423
00:19:50,587 --> 00:19:52,273
I think so.

424
00:19:53,797 --> 00:19:55,520
I don't know.

425
00:19:56,728 --> 00:19:59,002
This is all really new to me.

426
00:20:00,418 --> 00:20:03,220
I just got out of a
long relationship.

427
00:20:07,485 --> 00:20:09,132
I like your hair.

428
00:20:09,388 --> 00:20:11,191
Thanks.

429
00:20:11,365 --> 00:20:15,130
I figured new city,
a different color...

430
00:20:15,145 --> 00:20:17,070
# ...Wide open road #

431
00:20:17,115 --> 00:20:20,453
# It was love to us #

432
00:20:20,468 --> 00:20:23,551
# It was all that we had... #

433
00:20:24,206 --> 00:20:27,700
And the pizza there,
worst pizza ever.

434
00:20:27,718 --> 00:20:31,011
I'm so glad to be
back in New York.

435
00:20:32,547 --> 00:20:36,150
Listen, if there's anything
I can do to even begin

436
00:20:36,166 --> 00:20:38,733
to make things up to you...

437
00:20:41,315 --> 00:20:43,842
Actually there may be something
that you can do for me,

438
00:20:43,858 --> 00:20:47,343
but you can never
ever ask me why.

439
00:20:47,357 --> 00:20:50,560
So then I was promoted to
assistant m?nage-er...

440
00:20:50,577 --> 00:20:53,630
Manager-- why do
I keep doing that?

441
00:20:55,136 --> 00:20:58,712
- Lily?
- You gave me chlamydia, you jerk.

442
00:21:03,206 --> 00:21:06,483
So where was I?
Ah, yes, assistant m?nage-er...

443
00:21:06,497 --> 00:21:09,541
I did it again.
I can't believe it.

444
00:21:10,425 --> 00:21:15,621
You gave my twin sister chlamydia.
You slime!

445
00:21:17,748 --> 00:21:20,220
Wha... wait, I know magic.

446
00:21:23,755 --> 00:21:26,210
Well played, Eriksen.

447
00:21:26,225 --> 00:21:28,743
Well played.
