1
00:00:00,670 --> 00:00:02,534
Kids, there's nothing
more wonderful

2
00:00:02,544 --> 00:00:04,318
than New York City
in the winter...

3
00:00:04,353 --> 00:00:06,507
except the view of New
York City in the winter

4
00:00:06,517 --> 00:00:08,379
through your apartment window.

5
00:00:08,421 --> 00:00:11,307
In the winter of 2006,
Marshall, Lily, Robin and I

6
00:00:11,317 --> 00:00:13,901
were all deep in couple
hibernation mode.

7
00:00:13,911 --> 00:00:16,604
Sadly, this left Uncle
Barney out in the cold.

8
00:00:16,614 --> 00:00:18,792
Okay. All-night rave,

9
00:00:18,802 --> 00:00:20,655
abandoned tire
factory in Newark.

10
00:00:20,668 --> 00:00:22,420
We're on the list. Who's in?

11
00:00:22,433 --> 00:00:24,141
- Nope.
- No.

12
00:00:26,137 --> 00:00:30,103
Private jet. Teeterboro Airport,
skinny-skydiving. Who's in?

13
00:00:30,119 --> 00:00:31,572
- Nope.
- No, thanks.

14
00:00:33,429 --> 00:00:38,422
One beer. Bar, downstairs,
15 second walk. Who's in?

15
00:00:38,436 --> 00:00:41,913
Shh... Lily went sleepy-bye.

16
00:00:43,896 --> 00:00:46,892
It got so bad,
Barney tried to be his own wingman.

17
00:00:46,905 --> 00:00:49,283
Hi. Have you met me?

18
00:00:51,268 --> 00:00:53,930
Finally, he decided to
bring in reinforcements.

19
00:00:53,948 --> 00:00:55,373
- No.
- No.

20
00:00:55,398 --> 00:00:58,133
Yes. And do you know why?

21
00:00:58,145 --> 00:01:01,701
Hang on to your bedsores,
grandparents from Willy Wonka,

22
00:01:01,715 --> 00:01:04,931
because guess who's on his way
up to this apartment right now?

23
00:01:04,948 --> 00:01:07,761
My... wait for it...

24
00:01:07,775 --> 00:01:10,382
brother, James. React.

25
00:01:10,397 --> 00:01:11,562
- Hey!
- Hey!

26
00:01:11,578 --> 00:01:13,053
- You have a brother?
- Yeah.

27
00:01:13,068 --> 00:01:17,273
He's the "awesome-est," most best
"looking-est," greatest guy ever.

28
00:01:17,286 --> 00:01:19,220
He's exactly like Barney.

29
00:01:19,235 --> 00:01:20,763
That's what I just said.

30
00:01:21,258 --> 00:01:24,151
Well, Barney and his brother
aren't exactly alike.

31
00:01:24,166 --> 00:01:25,650
James is gay.

32
00:01:25,667 --> 00:01:27,582
Really? I never in
a million years

33
00:01:27,596 --> 00:01:30,233
would I picture you with a gay brother,
that's awesome.

34
00:01:30,247 --> 00:01:31,973
Yeah. I just wanted
you to have a heads up,

35
00:01:31,987 --> 00:01:34,433
so you don't act all
surprised when he gets here.

36
00:01:34,757 --> 00:01:36,132
Here he is.

37
00:01:38,286 --> 00:01:40,072
What up, New York.

38
00:01:42,707 --> 00:01:44,190
Thanks for the heads up.

39
00:01:58,237 --> 00:02:02,602
How in God's name did it never come up
that Barney has a gay, black brother?

40
00:02:02,738 --> 00:02:04,201
Is he black?

41
00:02:04,227 --> 00:02:07,011
I guess I'm the kind of person that
focuses on who people are on the inside

42
00:02:07,047 --> 00:02:09,370
rather than the
color of their skin.

43
00:02:09,385 --> 00:02:12,360
I'm kidding,
I just wanted to see your face.

44
00:02:12,787 --> 00:02:14,662
Yeah, so now the
wedding's back on.

45
00:02:14,678 --> 00:02:16,400
Anyway, James,
how have you been?

46
00:02:16,415 --> 00:02:17,913
Awesome, as per "yoozh."

47
00:02:17,928 --> 00:02:20,891
I just went
skinny-skydiving. Legendary.

48
00:02:20,905 --> 00:02:23,702
And my laser tag team,
just made it to regional finals.

49
00:02:23,715 --> 00:02:25,460
"Legendarier."

50
00:02:25,478 --> 00:02:27,462
And by now you've
noticed the suit--

51
00:02:27,477 --> 00:02:28,520
go 'head, touch it.

52
00:02:28,538 --> 00:02:31,202
Handcrafted by
Pietro Dellacamera,

53
00:02:31,216 --> 00:02:35,022
Milan's famous
101-year-old tailor

54
00:02:35,038 --> 00:02:37,323
who upon completing
the very last stitch

55
00:02:37,338 --> 00:02:39,343
in this suit dropped dead,

56
00:02:39,358 --> 00:02:42,371
which is ironic because that
is how gorgeous I look in it.

57
00:02:42,387 --> 00:02:43,612
C'mon.

58
00:02:48,507 --> 00:02:49,732
Gimme five.

59
00:02:49,995 --> 00:02:51,350
Is "gimme five" back?

60
00:02:51,367 --> 00:02:53,750
Oh, yeah.
I put it in my blog this morning.

61
00:02:53,856 --> 00:02:56,300
Guys, "gimme five" is back!

62
00:02:56,565 --> 00:02:58,421
Oh, James,
this is my girlfriend, Robin.

63
00:02:58,437 --> 00:03:00,833
- Hey. It's so nice to meet you.
- You, too.

64
00:03:00,848 --> 00:03:03,632
So, I have to ask,
there's a story here.

65
00:03:04,098 --> 00:03:05,423
Please.

66
00:03:05,896 --> 00:03:08,460
The truth is,
Barney and James got a lot of...

67
00:03:08,476 --> 00:03:10,861
different explanations from
their mom over the years.

68
00:03:10,876 --> 00:03:13,030
Well, boys, you look different

69
00:03:13,048 --> 00:03:15,070
because when I was
pregnant with you,

70
00:03:15,085 --> 00:03:17,301
I only ate vanilla ice cream.

71
00:03:17,315 --> 00:03:19,280
And when I was
pregnant with you,

72
00:03:19,296 --> 00:03:21,422
can you guess what kind
of ice cream I ate?

73
00:03:21,436 --> 00:03:23,501
- Coffee?
- No, James,

74
00:03:23,516 --> 00:03:25,831
I ate chocolate ice cream.

75
00:03:25,847 --> 00:03:29,631
But I did drink tons of coffee when
I was pregnant with both of you.

76
00:03:29,648 --> 00:03:31,782
Can't smoke without my coffee.

77
00:03:32,428 --> 00:03:36,580
I don't know, boys,
I guess it's just one of those things.

78
00:03:37,395 --> 00:03:38,971
Stop asking me!

79
00:03:38,985 --> 00:03:41,860
You  know what you two are?
You're little racists!

80
00:03:41,986 --> 00:03:43,813
So what are you guys
gonna do tonight?

81
00:03:43,827 --> 00:03:45,371
I'll tell you what
James is gonna do.

82
00:03:45,386 --> 00:03:47,391
He's gonna do the job
you've been neglecting.

83
00:03:47,405 --> 00:03:51,291
And, as always, he'll do it a
lot better than you ever did.

84
00:03:51,328 --> 00:03:52,580
Ted...

85
00:03:52,597 --> 00:03:55,701
James is my wingman now.

86
00:03:56,216 --> 00:03:57,632
Okay.

87
00:03:58,478 --> 00:04:01,900
Last time James was in town,
Barney got slapped once,

88
00:04:01,917 --> 00:04:03,581
lucky twice, and...

89
00:04:03,597 --> 00:04:05,433
whose penthouse hot
tub did you end up in?

90
00:04:05,448 --> 00:04:07,811
Ah, public figure,
confidentiality agreement.

91
00:04:07,826 --> 00:04:09,132
But I will say this:

92
00:04:09,148 --> 00:04:10,773
way more back hair than any guy

93
00:04:10,788 --> 00:04:13,930
who can afford laser hair
removal should have.

94
00:04:13,945 --> 00:04:18,073
And then there was the time they
scored the brother/sister combo.

95
00:04:18,085 --> 00:04:19,672
It was everything
we ever dreamed of

96
00:04:19,685 --> 00:04:21,503
when watching Donnie and Marie.

97
00:04:21,515 --> 00:04:23,400
She was a little bit country.

98
00:04:23,415 --> 00:04:26,180
He was a little bit
way into black guys.

99
00:04:26,205 --> 00:04:29,651
Yeah, Barney and James together
was a lethal combination.

100
00:04:29,668 --> 00:04:32,063
Since there was never
any crossover in targets,

101
00:04:32,077 --> 00:04:35,180
James was always there for
Barney with the assist.

102
00:04:39,518 --> 00:04:41,703
Whoa. Your scarf...

103
00:04:41,715 --> 00:04:43,622
it is fierce!

104
00:04:43,635 --> 00:04:45,211
Thanks. H & M.

105
00:04:45,225 --> 00:04:46,733
What? I would never know,

106
00:04:46,745 --> 00:04:51,103
'cause it is so hot that my eyes
are melting. Oh, I can't see.

107
00:04:51,427 --> 00:04:53,683
Hey! You know,
speaking of things

108
00:04:53,698 --> 00:04:55,483
that would look good
wrapped around you,

109
00:04:55,497 --> 00:04:57,913
have you met my straight
brother, Barney?

110
00:04:57,926 --> 00:05:02,392
Oh, he is fab--
don't you go nowhere-- "ulous." Okay?

111
00:05:02,465 --> 00:05:04,880
And Barney always
returned the favor.

112
00:05:04,898 --> 00:05:06,443
Help, I don't think
he's breathing.

113
00:05:06,456 --> 00:05:08,173
Does anyone
know mouth-to-mouth?

114
00:05:08,188 --> 00:05:10,173
Oh, my God, I do!

115
00:05:10,375 --> 00:05:13,033
Okay, great.
How 'bout you instead?

116
00:05:13,905 --> 00:05:16,081
Oh, man,
I am so excited that you're here!

117
00:05:16,095 --> 00:05:18,213
It has been forever since
I have been around anyone

118
00:05:18,227 --> 00:05:19,870
even remotely fun.

119
00:05:19,886 --> 00:05:21,823
Uh, yes offense.

120
00:05:22,327 --> 00:05:24,560
You guys are still going
out with us tonight, right?

121
00:05:24,575 --> 00:05:26,170
- No. 
- Jammies.

122
00:05:26,185 --> 00:05:28,541
Tonight? It's after 9:00 and...

123
00:05:28,555 --> 00:05:30,571
I have warm soup belly.

124
00:05:30,687 --> 00:05:33,571
Oh, no, no, no, no, no. Guys...

125
00:05:33,587 --> 00:05:36,363
you are young,
attractive people here

126
00:05:36,377 --> 00:05:38,851
in the greatest city on earth.

127
00:05:38,866 --> 00:05:40,321
There  are boys and girls

128
00:05:40,336 --> 00:05:43,092
in Nobody Cares, Wyoming,
wishing they could be here.

129
00:05:43,106 --> 00:05:46,383
But instead, they are in someone's
basement drinking bad malt liquor,

130
00:05:46,395 --> 00:05:49,091
debating whether or not they're
going to spend their Saturday night

131
00:05:49,107 --> 00:05:50,622
in  the parking lot
of the feed store

132
00:05:50,636 --> 00:05:52,922
or in some other
dude's basement.

133
00:05:52,936 --> 00:05:55,623
You owe it to them to rise up

134
00:05:55,706 --> 00:05:57,913
and shimmy your lazy
asses into something hot,

135
00:05:57,928 --> 00:06:01,090
and you go out there and
you live their dream!

136
00:06:01,107 --> 00:06:02,861
- Can I get a "hell, yeah"?
- Hell, yeah!

137
00:06:02,997 --> 00:06:05,441
- Can I get a "hell, yeah"?
- Hell, yeah!

138
00:06:05,458 --> 00:06:07,111
- Can I get a "woo-woo"?
- Woo-woo!

139
00:06:07,126 --> 00:06:10,260
Go do it for Wyoming! Yes!

140
00:06:10,345 --> 00:06:12,042
Testify!

141
00:06:12,876 --> 00:06:15,233
So that night,
Barney got his wish.

142
00:06:15,248 --> 00:06:16,381
We all went out.

143
00:06:16,397 --> 00:06:17,890
Daddy's home!

144
00:06:18,283 --> 00:06:19,501
Yeah.

145
00:06:21,937 --> 00:06:23,863
All right, bro.
What do you like?

146
00:06:23,879 --> 00:06:26,042
Guy in super tight black T?

147
00:06:26,059 --> 00:06:27,731
Super tight black guy?

148
00:06:27,748 --> 00:06:29,322
Guy who looks like Mr. T?

149
00:06:29,335 --> 00:06:32,681
Mmm, yes, yes, and...
talk to me after two martinis.

150
00:06:32,697 --> 00:06:34,742
Let's focus on you, my man.

151
00:06:35,088 --> 00:06:36,833
I'm feeling lazy.

152
00:06:36,898 --> 00:06:38,550
How 'bout girl with
the chocolatini?

153
00:06:38,568 --> 00:06:41,492
Oh... boom, back tattoo.

154
00:06:41,628 --> 00:06:43,210
Hero and the pig?

155
00:06:43,227 --> 00:06:45,132
- Let's ride.
- Fo' 'sho.

156
00:06:47,155 --> 00:06:50,331
Damn baby, nice tramp stamp!

157
00:06:50,346 --> 00:06:52,000
- Get off me, you pig!
- Hey! Hey!

158
00:06:52,015 --> 00:06:54,190
Her body art is not an
invitation to grope her,

159
00:06:54,205 --> 00:06:56,290
it's an expression
of her inner self.

160
00:06:56,308 --> 00:07:00,330
I'm sure, in many ways,
she is the dolphin encircled by flowers.

161
00:07:00,347 --> 00:07:01,861
- What? What?
- What? What?

162
00:07:01,877 --> 00:07:03,600
Cool.

163
00:07:05,938 --> 00:07:07,512
Let me know if he
bothers you again.

164
00:07:07,527 --> 00:07:11,052
Thanks. You should stay close...
just in case.

165
00:07:11,065 --> 00:07:13,952
Sure. If it'll make
you feel safer.

166
00:07:14,208 --> 00:07:15,461
I'm Barney.

167
00:07:15,746 --> 00:07:18,931
Now, kids, when you're out at a noisy,
crowded bar,

168
00:07:18,947 --> 00:07:21,813
you can always tell the
difference between the singles

169
00:07:21,826 --> 00:07:23,392
and the couples.

170
00:07:23,405 --> 00:07:25,773
You just have to
look for the signs.

171
00:07:26,376 --> 00:07:27,580
- Break.
- Boiling hot.

172
00:07:27,598 --> 00:07:29,851
Singles stay on their
feet for maneuverability.

173
00:07:29,866 --> 00:07:31,312
- Hey!
- Hi, how are ya?

174
00:07:31,325 --> 00:07:34,062
Have you met my brother?

175
00:07:34,577 --> 00:07:37,000
Oh, hello. Have a drink.

176
00:07:37,016 --> 00:07:38,691
Nice to meet ya.

177
00:07:41,128 --> 00:07:44,181
Couples, exhausted by the
sheer act of leaving the house,

178
00:07:44,197 --> 00:07:46,601
are obsessed with finding
a place to sit down.

179
00:07:47,486 --> 00:07:49,791
There are a lot of
other indicators, too.

180
00:07:49,807 --> 00:07:51,973
From choice of
social lubricant...

181
00:07:53,827 --> 00:07:55,792
...to basic body language.

182
00:07:56,357 --> 00:07:58,521
But the point is,
there are many ways to tell

183
00:07:58,535 --> 00:08:00,651
whether someone
has Single Stamina

184
00:08:00,666 --> 00:08:02,090
or Couples Coma.

185
00:08:02,105 --> 00:08:03,681
I wish I would've
worn sneakers.

186
00:08:03,697 --> 00:08:06,533
I just got finished running
from some fat, hairy guy

187
00:08:06,546 --> 00:08:09,003
who was periscoping out
of his pleather pants.

188
00:08:09,016 --> 00:08:11,543
Permission to come
aboard denied.

189
00:08:11,746 --> 00:08:13,513
I miss my jammies.

190
00:08:13,526 --> 00:08:15,822
I can't believe I
wore a bra for this.

191
00:08:15,837 --> 00:08:18,823
Bras suck.
They're so confining and unnatural.

192
00:08:18,836 --> 00:08:21,022
Yeah, they're like
a boobie zoo.

193
00:08:21,037 --> 00:08:23,580
Well, why don't you take it off
then and let those puppies breathe?

194
00:08:23,617 --> 00:08:25,720
Oh, please go sweat
on someone else.

195
00:08:26,557 --> 00:08:27,913
Poor guy.

196
00:08:28,148 --> 00:08:30,263
Poor guy? Poor my boobs.

197
00:08:30,277 --> 00:08:32,172
Well, it takes a lot of
guts to approach a girl

198
00:08:32,186 --> 00:08:33,682
and you just crushed him.

199
00:08:33,698 --> 00:08:37,041
Oh, yeah, yeah.
He looks all broken up inside.

200
00:08:37,257 --> 00:08:38,853
Whatever, you guys have
no idea what it's like

201
00:08:38,888 --> 00:08:40,452
to be on the receiving end.

202
00:08:40,465 --> 00:08:43,991
"Oh, poor me. I'm a pretty girl

203
00:08:44,007 --> 00:08:45,970
and everybody everywhere
wants to buy me drinks

204
00:08:45,988 --> 00:08:47,551
and have sex with me."

205
00:08:47,566 --> 00:08:48,441
Waa.

206
00:08:48,458 --> 00:08:51,330
"Oh, poor me.
I get to order yummy, pink drinks

207
00:08:51,345 --> 00:08:53,381
with chunks of real fruit
that guys secretly like,

208
00:08:53,395 --> 00:08:55,150
but  can't order because
they'll be made fun of."

209
00:08:55,188 --> 00:08:56,853
- Dude.
- They're delicious!

210
00:08:57,717 --> 00:09:00,382
Excuse me. Join me in a shot?

211
00:09:00,395 --> 00:09:02,301
Oh, no thanks. I've had enough.

212
00:09:05,827 --> 00:09:07,213
He's too in shape,

213
00:09:07,228 --> 00:09:10,281
we'd spend all night talking
about his body fat content.

214
00:09:10,528 --> 00:09:12,131
Now, if you'll excuse me,

215
00:09:12,147 --> 00:09:15,982
I'm gonna go have a yummy,
pink drink with fruit in it...

216
00:09:15,996 --> 00:09:17,572
because I can.

217
00:09:19,045 --> 00:09:21,151
You know, that was,
like, the third hot guy

218
00:09:21,168 --> 00:09:22,862
that James blew off tonight.

219
00:09:22,878 --> 00:09:25,290
Yeah, he's turning down shots,
he's yawning,

220
00:09:25,305 --> 00:09:27,053
he's whining about his feet.

221
00:09:27,067 --> 00:09:28,813
He's as bad as we are.

222
00:09:28,827 --> 00:09:30,002
He is.

223
00:09:30,016 --> 00:09:33,660
Wait, he's exactly as bad as we are.
You guys don't think that James is...

224
00:09:33,678 --> 00:09:35,042
in a relationship?

225
00:09:35,058 --> 00:09:37,742
No. There's no way.
He's Barney's brother.

226
00:09:37,755 --> 00:09:39,322
Look at that.

227
00:09:39,968 --> 00:09:41,802
He's texting!

228
00:09:42,976 --> 00:09:44,510
Oh, my God!

229
00:09:44,527 --> 00:09:46,212
He is in a couple.

230
00:09:46,228 --> 00:09:48,232
This is gonna kill Barney.

231
00:09:48,246 --> 00:09:49,743
What's gonna kill me?

232
00:09:49,946 --> 00:09:51,562
What's going on?

233
00:09:51,975 --> 00:09:53,530
B-Barney?

234
00:09:54,305 --> 00:09:57,802
Have you noticed anything...
different about James?

235
00:09:57,817 --> 00:09:58,872
No.

236
00:09:58,898 --> 00:10:02,042
I mean, he's glowing from his peel,
if that's what you mean.

237
00:10:03,667 --> 00:10:06,333
We have reason to believe
that James is, uh,

238
00:10:06,348 --> 00:10:07,840
maybe hiding
something from you.

239
00:10:07,858 --> 00:10:10,190
I-I know you're not gonna
like hearing this, but...

240
00:10:10,207 --> 00:10:11,640
Barney...

241
00:10:11,845 --> 00:10:13,852
your brother is...

242
00:10:14,746 --> 00:10:16,473
monogamous.

243
00:10:17,635 --> 00:10:19,760
That's ridiculous!

244
00:10:19,818 --> 00:10:22,362
Just because he's
a little sleepy,

245
00:10:22,378 --> 00:10:25,581
and he hasn't had sex with
anyone in a bathroom stall...

246
00:10:27,505 --> 00:10:30,923
He hasn't had sex with
anyone in a bathroom stall.

247
00:10:31,088 --> 00:10:33,251
And, Barney...

248
00:10:33,266 --> 00:10:36,081
I hate to be the one to
tell you this, but...

249
00:10:37,017 --> 00:10:38,532
he's texting.

250
00:10:38,546 --> 00:10:40,880
No, he... No!

251
00:10:42,575 --> 00:10:45,362
That... is impossible.

252
00:10:48,305 --> 00:10:51,550
Excuse... Excuse... Ex...

253
00:10:52,915 --> 00:10:53,972
Hey, bro.

254
00:10:53,986 --> 00:10:55,671
Don't change the subject.

255
00:10:55,685 --> 00:10:56,863
Let me see your phone.

256
00:10:56,876 --> 00:10:57,623
Why?

257
00:10:57,635 --> 00:10:59,322
I just want to see your phone.
Let me see your phone.

258
00:10:59,358 --> 00:11:01,510
No, it's just a phone.
It's just a phone!

259
00:11:01,527 --> 00:11:03,742
And it's got Internet access,
and it's got a camera on it,

260
00:11:03,777 --> 00:11:05,502
and you can surf the Web
and do the whole thing.

261
00:11:05,535 --> 00:11:08,063
It's so amazing how far
technology has come.

262
00:11:08,075 --> 00:11:09,142
What kind of phone do you have?

263
00:11:09,176 --> 00:11:10,330
I got...

264
00:11:15,256 --> 00:11:16,461
Who is this? 

265
00:11:16,476 --> 00:11:19,823
And the answer better be:
"I don't remember his name."

266
00:11:21,165 --> 00:11:23,101
That is Tom.

267
00:11:24,086 --> 00:11:25,783
And he's my fianc?.

268
00:11:31,797 --> 00:11:32,862
Hey.

269
00:11:34,448 --> 00:11:36,180
I don't support this.

270
00:11:36,235 --> 00:11:37,331
Gay marriage?

271
00:11:37,345 --> 00:11:40,012
Not gay marriage-- marriage!

272
00:11:40,937 --> 00:11:42,623
How can you do this?

273
00:11:42,637 --> 00:11:45,540
We  were raised in the same house,
with the same values!

274
00:11:45,917 --> 00:11:48,991
Believe me,
I fought this for a long time.

275
00:11:49,007 --> 00:11:51,053
Come on, it's embarrassing.

276
00:11:51,367 --> 00:11:54,552
Look, this felt unnatural to me,
too, at first.

277
00:11:54,608 --> 00:11:56,973
But I fell in love.

278
00:11:56,988 --> 00:11:59,613
And Tom and I realized
you can't fight love.

279
00:11:59,628 --> 00:12:00,830
Oh, God.

280
00:12:00,845 --> 00:12:03,301
Is that what you two do together?
You sit around the house

281
00:12:03,317 --> 00:12:07,023
and talk about love?
I think... I'm gonna be sick.

282
00:12:07,038 --> 00:12:08,752
Okay, okay, look,

283
00:12:08,766 --> 00:12:10,433
I need you to wrap your
head around this, okay?

284
00:12:10,465 --> 00:12:12,390
Because it is happening.

285
00:12:12,815 --> 00:12:15,391
And I want you to
be my best man.

286
00:12:15,407 --> 00:12:18,082
What? No way.

287
00:12:22,615 --> 00:12:24,713
Well, I'm sorry
you feel that way.

288
00:12:29,228 --> 00:12:31,013
I hope you change your mind.

289
00:12:37,028 --> 00:12:38,491
Two beers, one shot.

290
00:12:38,506 --> 00:12:41,000
Oh, it's a freaking epidemic.

291
00:12:44,545 --> 00:12:47,763
Oh, sweetie!
Did you make that for me?

292
00:12:49,176 --> 00:12:50,593
Yes.

293
00:12:52,466 --> 00:12:55,130
Clam Bake.
Staten Island. Who's in?

294
00:12:56,038 --> 00:12:58,702
Okay, I didn't have high
hopes for that one.

295
00:12:58,907 --> 00:13:00,600
Okay, here's my thing.

296
00:13:00,616 --> 00:13:02,263
If gay guys start
getting married,

297
00:13:02,275 --> 00:13:04,583
then suddenly the whole
world's gonna be doing it.

298
00:13:04,598 --> 00:13:06,190
That's how it works.
They start something,

299
00:13:06,227 --> 00:13:08,902
then six months later,
everyone follows.

300
00:13:08,917 --> 00:13:11,481
Like now everyone
gets manicures.

301
00:13:11,495 --> 00:13:12,842
I don't get manicures.

302
00:13:12,856 --> 00:13:15,983
Okay, then like how...
Like getting your chest waxed.

303
00:13:15,996 --> 00:13:17,671
You get your chest waxed?

304
00:13:17,685 --> 00:13:19,413
You know what I mean!

305
00:13:20,005 --> 00:13:22,352
Gay marriage is going
to cause single life,

306
00:13:22,366 --> 00:13:24,542
as we know it, to die out.

307
00:13:24,558 --> 00:13:28,012
Think of how the American
family will be strengthened.

308
00:13:28,028 --> 00:13:30,302
Barney, I'm sorry you're upset,
but you got to suck it up

309
00:13:30,318 --> 00:13:31,430
and be a man about this.

310
00:13:31,446 --> 00:13:32,483
No.

311
00:13:32,495 --> 00:13:36,201
It's always been me and him together,
being awesome,

312
00:13:36,215 --> 00:13:38,653
while the rest of
you walked two-by-two

313
00:13:38,668 --> 00:13:41,430
onto your ark of
sexless boredom.

314
00:13:41,447 --> 00:13:43,270
Just because James
is getting married

315
00:13:43,288 --> 00:13:45,080
doesn't mean things
are going to change.

316
00:13:45,096 --> 00:13:48,412
Yeah. Like things haven't
changed with you people.

317
00:13:49,526 --> 00:13:51,752
Look, my sister married
a guy I didn't like.

318
00:13:51,766 --> 00:13:54,183
Sandals and socks--
come on, buddy.

319
00:13:54,197 --> 00:13:56,340
But I took her out,
we celebrated.

320
00:13:56,357 --> 00:13:57,713
It was the right thing to do.

321
00:13:57,728 --> 00:13:59,472
You got to support him.

322
00:14:01,308 --> 00:14:03,282
You're right, Ted.

323
00:14:03,398 --> 00:14:06,131
This is a cause
for celebration.

324
00:14:06,146 --> 00:14:09,553
We need to take him out and
celebrate the commitment

325
00:14:09,565 --> 00:14:11,860
he and Tom are about to make.

326
00:14:14,538 --> 00:14:16,472
Yeah. This is where
we're celebrating

327
00:14:16,486 --> 00:14:19,001
the commitment that Tom
and I are about to make?

328
00:14:19,016 --> 00:14:20,330
What? Yeah!

329
00:14:20,347 --> 00:14:23,551
See, that cage represents
your commitment.

330
00:14:28,836 --> 00:14:32,780
Oh, my God. Freedom 
has never tasted so delicious.

331
00:14:32,858 --> 00:14:34,051
Hey.

332
00:14:34,065 --> 00:14:35,711
You work out?

333
00:14:35,777 --> 00:14:37,152
I do.

334
00:14:37,165 --> 00:14:38,952
And thank you for noticing.

335
00:14:38,966 --> 00:14:41,170
You're obviously in very
good shape yourself.

336
00:14:41,187 --> 00:14:42,740
Well, I try.

337
00:14:42,756 --> 00:14:44,351
So you want to dance?

338
00:14:44,697 --> 00:14:47,071
You know what?
I'm very flattered, and, objectively,

339
00:14:47,086 --> 00:14:50,251
you're a very attractive man,
but this is actually my fianc?e.

340
00:14:50,265 --> 00:14:52,911
I'm sorry.
You know, I saw your drink and I...

341
00:14:52,925 --> 00:14:55,770
No, no, this isn't my drink.
This is hers.

342
00:14:55,787 --> 00:14:57,633
No, it isn't.

343
00:14:58,155 --> 00:14:59,490
Whatever.

344
00:14:59,507 --> 00:15:00,812
How 'bout you?

345
00:15:00,827 --> 00:15:02,382
Oh, I'm straight, too.

346
00:15:02,397 --> 00:15:04,330
But I thank you for your time,

347
00:15:04,345 --> 00:15:07,333
and I appreciate your
interest in my body.

348
00:15:09,478 --> 00:15:10,573
You see that?

349
00:15:10,585 --> 00:15:12,613
Being hit on doesn't
have to be terrible.

350
00:15:12,627 --> 00:15:15,792
I feel flattered,
and everyone left with their dignity.

351
00:15:17,976 --> 00:15:20,111
Hey, I really like
your sweater.

352
00:15:20,127 --> 00:15:22,873
Wow. You actually do,
don't you?

353
00:15:22,887 --> 00:15:25,322
You're not checking out
my boobs or anything.

354
00:15:25,338 --> 00:15:27,660
My name's Gay Ken,
what do you think?

355
00:15:27,677 --> 00:15:30,023
I love this place! Let's dance!

356
00:15:30,035 --> 00:15:32,670
- And not be groped!
- Whoo! Thank you.

357
00:15:35,135 --> 00:15:37,720
- Damn.
- Thank you!

358
00:15:38,967 --> 00:15:40,810
- We're hot.
- Totally.

359
00:15:41,767 --> 00:15:43,993
And then Tom says to the dealer

360
00:15:44,005 --> 00:15:47,793
that the handmade Georgian
clock has a chip on the corner.

361
00:15:47,805 --> 00:15:50,970
Blam, we get that puppy half price.
What up?!

362
00:15:50,986 --> 00:15:52,253
Bam!

363
00:15:53,148 --> 00:15:57,013
Sounds like you really rocked
that arts and crafts fair.

364
00:15:57,025 --> 00:15:58,410
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah.

365
00:15:58,425 --> 00:16:01,303
Hey, oh, my God.
This is so liberating,

366
00:16:01,315 --> 00:16:03,490
being able to talk
about this to you.

367
00:16:03,508 --> 00:16:05,093
I cannot wait for
you to meet Tom.

368
00:16:05,105 --> 00:16:07,621
And I cannot wait for you
to meet my good friend...

369
00:16:07,635 --> 00:16:09,021
this guy.

370
00:16:09,285 --> 00:16:11,433
Excuse me, do you know anyone 
who would like to buy

371
00:16:11,445 --> 00:16:14,443
my incredibly muscular, fun,
large-handed brother a drink?

372
00:16:14,455 --> 00:16:18,413
Eh, eh, eh, let's focus on you,
Barnaby. Okay.

373
00:16:19,698 --> 00:16:23,573
All right. I spy a group of women
who have let their defenses down

374
00:16:23,585 --> 00:16:25,400
because they are in a gay club.

375
00:16:25,416 --> 00:16:26,990
You see that chick right there?

376
00:16:27,037 --> 00:16:30,430
She looks like she'd fall for
sports agent and football player.

377
00:16:30,445 --> 00:16:31,810
Okay, I'm in.

378
00:16:31,826 --> 00:16:33,342
Which one am I?

379
00:16:33,668 --> 00:16:34,811
Please.

380
00:16:37,027 --> 00:16:39,622
He's very shy, loves tennis and Brazil,
and drops his pants

381
00:16:39,636 --> 00:16:42,231
after three dirty martinis.
Now go, man, go!

382
00:16:47,418 --> 00:16:50,890
I just never thought I'd
see Barney so vulnerable.

383
00:16:50,906 --> 00:16:53,662
Well, I guess no one wants to feel like
they're going through the world alone.

384
00:16:53,697 --> 00:16:56,420
Look at me, 
in a yummy sandwich!

385
00:16:56,436 --> 00:16:59,572
Okay, we're actually right in the
middle of something right now, so...

386
00:16:59,585 --> 00:17:02,431
Ooh, I know what I want to be
in the middle of. Thoughts?

387
00:17:02,446 --> 00:17:04,831
God, can't two straight guys
come to a gay dance club,

388
00:17:04,847 --> 00:17:07,580
enjoy some techno and good
conversation without being bothered?

389
00:17:11,097 --> 00:17:14,133
How's it going, guys?
Still enjoying the attentions of men?

390
00:17:14,145 --> 00:17:16,972
That's like the eighth guy
who's hit on us in ten minutes.

391
00:17:16,986 --> 00:17:19,442
It's like, hello,
my eyes are up here.

392
00:17:19,457 --> 00:17:20,902
And  it's never the hot ones.

393
00:17:20,918 --> 00:17:23,232
It's always the losers.
Bums me out!

394
00:17:23,627 --> 00:17:25,791
Looks like the boys
learned their lesson.

395
00:17:25,806 --> 00:17:27,421
Do you totally
miss being hit on?

396
00:17:27,437 --> 00:17:29,230
Oh, totally.
Let's go find a sports bar.

397
00:17:30,927 --> 00:17:33,691
James, James,
since you like arts and crafts,

398
00:17:33,715 --> 00:17:37,320
look at what Charles here
made with cherry stems.

399
00:17:37,478 --> 00:17:39,211
He did it with his tongue.

400
00:17:39,227 --> 00:17:40,421
Yeah.

401
00:17:40,436 --> 00:17:41,143
Barney.

402
00:17:41,155 --> 00:17:44,433
So, Charles, why don't you put
your number in my brother's phone,

403
00:17:44,445 --> 00:17:45,650
and once he's in
a funner mood...

404
00:17:45,687 --> 00:17:47,503
Barney, Barney,
I don't want his number.

405
00:17:47,515 --> 00:17:50,321
I don't want anyone's
number, okay?

406
00:17:50,337 --> 00:17:51,830
I'm getting married.

407
00:17:51,898 --> 00:17:53,360
Wow.

408
00:17:53,418 --> 00:17:55,530
- Best of luck to you both.
- Thank you.

409
00:17:55,545 --> 00:17:57,110
My number's in here.

410
00:17:57,126 --> 00:17:58,861
I'm very discreet.

411
00:18:00,255 --> 00:18:01,961
Okay, okay, excuse me.

412
00:18:01,975 --> 00:18:03,710
Barney, family talk.

413
00:18:03,725 --> 00:18:05,881
Okay, dude,
you have got to stop this, okay?

414
00:18:05,896 --> 00:18:08,840
I know that my getting married is
threatening to your way of life...

415
00:18:08,855 --> 00:18:10,383
Oh, so now it's my way of life?

416
00:18:10,398 --> 00:18:12,570
I thought it was
our way of life.

417
00:18:12,585 --> 00:18:14,792
You've completely
turned your back on it.

418
00:18:14,808 --> 00:18:16,511
Look at you,
not even suited up.

419
00:18:16,528 --> 00:18:18,861
Do you remember why
we suit up, James?

420
00:18:18,878 --> 00:18:20,090
To get laid.

421
00:18:20,106 --> 00:18:22,150
To show people that
we are different

422
00:18:22,167 --> 00:18:25,590
from the millions of T-shirt
and jeans lemmings out there.

423
00:18:25,608 --> 00:18:28,190
The suit shows that we are
a force to be reckoned with,

424
00:18:28,206 --> 00:18:30,733
a two-person army that
plays by its own rules.

425
00:18:30,747 --> 00:18:33,252
But you've taken off the uniform,
you've crossed enemy lines,

426
00:18:33,265 --> 00:18:34,431
and you've abandoned me.

427
00:18:34,445 --> 00:18:35,800
Well, I'm not gonna
let you do that.

428
00:18:35,838 --> 00:18:39,491
It's not too late to back out
of this stupid marriage thing!

429
00:18:39,506 --> 00:18:41,163
You don't have to do this, bro!

430
00:18:41,178 --> 00:18:42,432
- Yes, I do.
- Why?!

431
00:18:42,446 --> 00:18:45,050
Because Tom and I are
gonna have a baby.

432
00:18:45,075 --> 00:18:47,101
What? There's gonna be a baby?

433
00:18:48,645 --> 00:18:51,413
Yes. We're adopting.

434
00:18:51,537 --> 00:18:55,130
Oh, my God.
I'm gonna be an uncle?

435
00:18:55,296 --> 00:18:57,031
For the rest of your life.

436
00:19:00,288 --> 00:19:03,003
And that's how Barney
became Uncle Barney.

437
00:19:03,055 --> 00:19:05,021
A year later,
at James's wedding,

438
00:19:05,036 --> 00:19:06,951
Barney could not have
been more proud.

439
00:19:06,966 --> 00:19:08,633
To James and Tom.

440
00:19:08,646 --> 00:19:11,211
May you have a long and
happy life together.

441
00:19:11,226 --> 00:19:14,433
And may I always have the skin
and libido of a much younger man.

442
00:19:14,446 --> 00:19:16,011
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

443
00:19:16,927 --> 00:19:18,190
Nice one.

444
00:19:18,645 --> 00:19:21,601
Thanks. I decided to leave
out the hetero college phase.

445
00:19:21,615 --> 00:19:23,022
No one wants to
hear about that.

446
00:19:23,035 --> 00:19:24,411
It was perfect.

447
00:19:24,428 --> 00:19:26,661
You even made Tom's dad cry.

448
00:19:26,677 --> 00:19:29,620
Might have been doing that
because he's a Republican.

449
00:19:30,846 --> 00:19:32,180
Whoa.

450
00:19:32,196 --> 00:19:33,670
It's 9:00.

451
00:19:33,687 --> 00:19:36,150
We should be getting back.
You guys want to split a cab?

452
00:19:36,165 --> 00:19:38,050
Uh, no, I think I'm gonna
stay a little bit longer.

453
00:19:38,085 --> 00:19:40,150
Yeah, me, too.
I'm not tired at all.

454
00:19:40,168 --> 00:19:42,461
All right, well, it's getting late.
Got to get the wife home.

455
00:19:42,497 --> 00:19:44,812
Oh, stop calling me that.
It makes me sound fat.

456
00:19:46,126 --> 00:19:48,643
Ugh, it's a freaking epidemic.

457
00:20:03,198 --> 00:20:04,801
- May I?
- Yeah.

458
00:20:10,778 --> 00:20:12,541
Hey, buddy.

459
00:20:12,666 --> 00:20:14,683
Your parents are married.

460
00:20:15,087 --> 00:20:16,592
Now, listen, you.

461
00:20:16,606 --> 00:20:19,132
Just because you're being
raised by married people

462
00:20:19,146 --> 00:20:21,652
doesn't mean you have to
choose that lifestyle.

463
00:20:21,666 --> 00:20:22,793
High-five.

464
00:20:23,888 --> 00:20:25,771
Luckily, you got me.

465
00:20:25,938 --> 00:20:29,440
In 20 and a half years,
you'll be 21,

466
00:20:29,456 --> 00:20:31,301
and I will be...

467
00:20:31,657 --> 00:20:34,060
Well, I haven't decided
how old I'll be yet.

468
00:20:34,168 --> 00:20:38,422
But we are gonna bro out,
uncle and nephew style.

469
00:20:38,465 --> 00:20:40,101
Stick with me, kid.

470
00:20:40,118 --> 00:20:43,150
I am gonna teach
you how to live.

471
00:20:43,756 --> 00:20:46,301
Great suit, by the way.

472
00:20:49,688 --> 00:20:51,352
Who is the cutest?

473
00:20:58,448 --> 00:20:59,922
I don't get it.

474
00:20:59,965 --> 00:21:03,032
Tom liked my breasts
in tenth grade.

475
00:21:03,536 --> 00:21:06,011
Why doesn't he like them now?

476
00:21:06,828 --> 00:21:08,262
Why?

477
00:21:08,917 --> 00:21:12,502
Rosa, why always be attracted
to the unavailable ones?

478
00:21:12,518 --> 00:21:14,781
Why not accept the fact that
you're a beautiful woman

479
00:21:14,797 --> 00:21:16,822
who is worthy of love?

480
00:21:16,838 --> 00:21:19,113
Are you brave enough
to hear that?

481
00:21:19,256 --> 00:21:20,342
You...
