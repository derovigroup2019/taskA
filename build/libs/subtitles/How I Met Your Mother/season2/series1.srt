1
00:00:00,568 --> 00:00:02,415
Okay where were we?

2
00:00:02,415 --> 00:00:04,362
It was June of 2006,

3
00:00:04,362 --> 00:00:06,659
and life had just taken
an unexpected turn.

4
00:00:06,659 --> 00:00:09,729
Dad, can't you just skip ahead
to the part where you meet Mom?

5
00:00:09,729 --> 00:00:12,084
I feel like you've been talking
for like a year.

6
00:00:12,336 --> 00:00:14,700
Honey, all this stuff
I'm telling you is important.

7
00:00:14,789 --> 00:00:16,226
It's all part of the story.

8
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:18,287
- Could I go to the bathroom?
- No.

9
00:00:19,338 --> 00:00:23,426
The summer of 2006
was both wonderful and awful.

10
00:00:23,905 --> 00:00:25,490
For me, it started out great.

11
00:00:25,512 --> 00:00:27,529
In fact, day one was amazing.

12
00:00:27,607 --> 00:00:29,783
I'd finally gotten together with Robin.

13
00:00:30,296 --> 00:00:33,363
But while I'd been off having
one of the best nights of my life,

14
00:00:34,587 --> 00:00:37,672
your uncle Marshall had been having
one of the worst nights of his.

15
00:00:41,307 --> 00:00:42,423
So that's it?

16
00:00:42,597 --> 00:00:43,681
We're breaking up?

17
00:00:44,355 --> 00:00:46,180
Marshall, I'm sorry.
I just...

18
00:00:46,456 --> 00:00:49,470
I just need to go to San Francisco
and do this art program and

19
00:00:49,475 --> 00:00:52,420
-and figure out who I am outside of us.

20
00:00:53,205 --> 00:00:55,790
And the only way
that I can do that is if...

21
00:00:56,655 --> 00:00:58,663
if we don't talk for a while.

22
00:00:59,457 --> 00:01:00,553
For a while.

23
00:01:01,485 --> 00:01:03,232
Try never, okay?

24
00:01:03,505 --> 00:01:06,041
You walk out that door,
and we're done.

25
00:01:06,307 --> 00:01:08,730
You're never going
to hear my voice again.

26
00:01:09,137 --> 00:01:10,431
I should call her.

27
00:01:10,436 --> 00:01:11,900
- No, No.
- Ted it is--

28
00:01:11,905 --> 00:01:14,221
If you call her when she asked you not to
you're just going to look weak

29
00:01:14,226 --> 00:01:15,530
and you're going to regret it.

30
00:01:15,595 --> 00:01:19,451
Now, listen, whenever you feel like
calling her, you come find me first.

31
00:01:20,008 --> 00:01:21,910
And I will punch you in the face.

32
00:01:22,796 --> 00:01:24,352
You're a good friend, Ted.

33
00:01:26,306 --> 00:01:27,682
Hey.

34
00:01:27,848 --> 00:01:29,013
So, did you hear the big news?

35
00:01:29,017 --> 00:01:31,192
You mean how Lily and Marshall broke up,

36
00:01:31,197 --> 00:01:34,691
and Lily's gone and nothing else
even remotely important happened last night,

37
00:01:34,697 --> 00:01:36,432
yeah, I think he knows.

38
00:01:36,457 --> 00:01:37,723
Oh, my God.

39
00:01:37,877 --> 00:01:39,913
I-I'm so sorry.
Wh--

40
00:01:39,916 --> 00:01:41,072
What happened?

41
00:01:41,307 --> 00:01:43,143
Well, she left.

42
00:01:43,147 --> 00:01:45,760
And I don't even know
if she's coming back.

43
00:01:46,085 --> 00:01:47,871
I didn't get your message until I woke up.

44
00:01:48,257 --> 00:01:50,460
- Bro, I am so sorry.
- Thanks.

45
00:01:50,598 --> 00:01:52,140
I know it must be tough,

46
00:01:52,146 --> 00:01:55,422
but are you ready to hear something
that will not only make you feel better,

47
00:01:55,426 --> 00:01:57,452
but will actively excite you?

48
00:01:57,455 --> 00:01:58,663
Sure.

49
00:01:59,005 --> 00:02:04,981
For the first time, ever, the three of us
are single at the same time.

50
00:02:05,305 --> 00:02:10,010
I've dreamed about this day, boys,
and it's going to be legendary.

51
00:02:10,156 --> 00:02:12,701
Together, we will own this city.

52
00:02:13,106 --> 00:02:17,141
Anytime a girl wants to get back
at her ex-boyfriends,

53
00:02:17,147 --> 00:02:18,720
we'll be there.

54
00:02:18,956 --> 00:02:22,620
Anytime a girl wants
to solve her father issues

55
00:02:22,627 --> 00:02:26,801
through promiscuity and binge drinking,
we will be there.

56
00:02:27,758 --> 00:02:31,203
Anytime a bachelorette party
drives through the city in a limo,

57
00:02:31,207 --> 00:02:33,282
sticking their heads out
the sunroof shouting,

58
00:02:33,287 --> 00:02:34,823
"What's up, New York?"

59
00:02:34,908 --> 00:02:38,112
we will be what is up New York.

60
00:02:38,907 --> 00:02:41,582
Gentlemen, we are about to embark on...

61
00:02:46,385 --> 00:02:48,943
Aw, man, you guys did it, didn't you?

62

63
00:03:04,637 --> 00:03:07,503
One thing I learned that summer
is that when love is beginning...

64
00:03:10,356 --> 00:03:14,783
...and love is ending,
the first 30 days are remarkably similar.

65
00:03:15,846 --> 00:03:18,392
For one thing,
you spend most of your time in bed.

66
00:03:23,408 --> 00:03:25,422
Your friends can't stand to listen to you.

67
00:03:29,207 --> 00:03:31,131
It was a really beautiful song.

68
00:03:32,107 --> 00:03:35,312
So... stupid, man.

69
00:03:36,005 --> 00:03:37,901
And you never seem to wear pants.

70
00:03:43,006 --> 00:03:46,002
- Hey, Marshall.
- Hey, Ted.

71
00:03:46,146 --> 00:03:47,271
You hungry?

72
00:03:47,358 --> 00:03:49,090
What's the point?
I could eat some food.

73
00:03:49,097 --> 00:03:51,051
It's just going to leave me.

74
00:03:51,377 --> 00:03:54,072
Well, at least in that scenario
you get to do the dumping.

75
00:03:55,366 --> 00:03:57,871
Come on, it's Sunday.
It's pancakes day.

76
00:03:58,007 --> 00:04:00,551
Lily always made the pancakes.

77
00:04:01,086 --> 00:04:03,181
God, I loved her pancakes.

78
00:04:03,245 --> 00:04:06,120
So soft.
So warm.

79
00:04:06,205 --> 00:04:08,213
So perfectly shaped.

80
00:04:08,775 --> 00:04:10,770
Are we still talking about her pancakes?

81
00:04:11,955 --> 00:04:14,232
Come on, you got to eat something;
what can I get you?

82
00:04:14,408 --> 00:04:16,940
- Beer.
- No, that's what you had for dinner.

83
00:04:17,158 --> 00:04:18,392
Fine.

84
00:04:18,575 --> 00:04:20,582
Then I'll just have leftovers.

85
00:04:23,005 --> 00:04:26,303
So, he stays home all the time
not getting laid?

86
00:04:26,407 --> 00:04:29,270
No, see, that's what you do
when you have a fianc?e.

87
00:04:29,605 --> 00:04:32,373
He should be down here celebrating.
He's free.

88
00:04:32,375 --> 00:04:34,943
He got that redheaded tumor removed.

89
00:04:35,608 --> 00:04:37,910
You should write
and illustrate children's books.

90
00:04:38,955 --> 00:04:40,331
You know what Marshall needs to do.

91
00:04:40,335 --> 00:04:42,821
He needs to stop being sad.

92
00:04:43,268 --> 00:04:47,000
When I get sad, I stop being sad
and be awesome instead.

93
00:04:47,857 --> 00:04:48,900
True story.

94
00:04:49,807 --> 00:04:51,523
It's only been a month.

95
00:04:51,605 --> 00:04:53,121
He just needs to go at his own pace.

96
00:04:53,128 --> 00:04:55,331
Anyway, Lily's the one
who caused this whole mess.

97
00:04:55,335 --> 00:04:56,893
Hey, cut her some slack.

98
00:04:56,898 --> 00:04:59,761
She's our friend, too.
She's just trying to figure out who she is.

99
00:04:59,765 --> 00:05:00,962
Figure out who she is?

100
00:05:00,967 --> 00:05:02,982
Yeah, she should call me;
I got a whole list.

101
00:05:02,987 --> 00:05:05,970
She's selfish.
She's immature. She's...

102
00:05:06,806 --> 00:05:07,471
What?

103
00:05:07,878 --> 00:05:10,100
God, your eyes are so blue.

104
00:05:11,307 --> 00:05:13,242
Teddy Bear.

105
00:05:16,258 --> 00:05:18,222
Oh that's a...

106
00:05:26,307 --> 00:05:28,121
Yeah, it was hard to feel too bad.

107
00:05:28,207 --> 00:05:31,672
I was dating the woman of my dreams,
and things were going great.

108
00:05:31,955 --> 00:05:33,122
Well, for the most part.

109
00:05:33,125 --> 00:05:35,030
So, I found her shampoo.

110
00:05:35,186 --> 00:05:36,550
I guess she left it here.

111
00:05:37,015 --> 00:05:38,432
It smells like her.

112
00:05:40,715 --> 00:05:44,971
Like lavender and seashells and hope.

113
00:05:47,028 --> 00:05:51,462
Somehow, erotic and comforting
all at the same time.

114
00:05:52,958 --> 00:05:54,331
That's my shampoo.

115
00:05:55,385 --> 00:05:57,130
Oh, sorry.

116
00:05:57,347 --> 00:05:59,682
Mmm, I thought he'd never go to sleep.

117
00:06:01,537 --> 00:06:03,492
- Uh-oh.
- Already?

118
00:06:05,677 --> 00:06:06,893
He's calling her.

119
00:06:06,898 --> 00:06:09,810
- I don't hear any--
- He's calling her.

120
00:06:10,008 --> 00:06:11,073
No.

121
00:06:12,308 --> 00:06:15,133
Okay, you're right,
I won't call her.

122
00:06:15,338 --> 00:06:17,423
I will not call her.

123
00:06:17,507 --> 00:06:19,543
Well, I called her.

124
00:06:19,878 --> 00:06:23,150
And get this, she changed her number.

125
00:06:23,158 --> 00:06:25,193
What, like I'm going to stalk her,
or something?

126
00:06:25,195 --> 00:06:27,193
Like she's so special.

127
00:06:27,195 --> 00:06:29,152
Like she's the only Lily Aldrin out there.

128
00:06:29,308 --> 00:06:32,071
'Cause there are four others
in the San Francisco area alone,

129
00:06:32,075 --> 00:06:34,013
and they all seem a lot better than her

130
00:06:34,016 --> 00:06:36,531
based on the brief conversations
I had with them.

131
00:06:37,188 --> 00:06:39,662
- Does he know I'm in here?
- Yeah, hey, Robin.

132
00:06:39,937 --> 00:06:43,003
- Anyways, one of the Lily Aldrins said...
- This has to stop.

133
00:06:43,107 --> 00:06:44,821
Ted, we just started dating.

134
00:06:44,825 --> 00:06:46,550
We agreed we don't want to move too fast,

135
00:06:46,555 --> 00:06:48,482
and yet somehow, we have a baby.

136
00:06:48,687 --> 00:06:50,230
He can't feed himself.

137
00:06:50,235 --> 00:06:53,993
- He cries a lot, he keeps us up all night.
- Have you tried breast-feeding?

138
00:06:54,257 --> 00:06:55,273
Nailed it!

139
00:06:55,557 --> 00:06:58,150
Look, they were together nine years.

140
00:06:58,157 --> 00:06:59,921
It's only been a month and a half.

141
00:06:59,985 --> 00:07:01,660
He just needs to go at his own pace.

142
00:07:01,687 --> 00:07:04,153
He slept on our floor last night, Ted.

143
00:07:04,155 --> 00:07:08,123
- He watched a scary movie.
- It is time for some tough love.

144
00:07:08,212 --> 00:07:10,007
We need to get him out of that apartment.

145
00:07:10,007 --> 00:07:12,563
He needs fresh air.
He needs sunshine.

146
00:07:12,566 --> 00:07:14,993
Mmm, sunshine.

147
00:07:15,427 --> 00:07:19,110
Gentlemen, please welcome
to the stage, Sunshine.

148
00:07:23,606 --> 00:07:25,821
All right, I really don't think
this is going to help.

149
00:07:26,445 --> 00:07:28,591
Do you know why
you're not over Lily yet?

150
00:07:28,595 --> 00:07:30,753
It's 'cause you can still
picture her naked.

151
00:07:30,757 --> 00:07:33,922
You can't get over a woman until
you can no longer picture her boobs;

152
00:07:33,928 --> 00:07:35,200
it's a scientific fact.

153
00:07:35,205 --> 00:07:41,461
The average male brain can only store
a finite number of boob images or "b-pegs".

154
00:07:41,738 --> 00:07:44,843
And your hard drive's
filled to capacity with Lily's.

155
00:07:46,097 --> 00:07:47,402
There are a lot of them.

156
00:07:47,758 --> 00:07:49,842
Well, they won't go away
until you overwrite them

157
00:07:49,845 --> 00:07:51,571
with images of other women's boobs.

158
00:07:51,576 --> 00:07:55,521
Now, this journey may take
as many as a million boobs,

159
00:07:55,526 --> 00:07:57,923
so we begin here tonight, my friend.

160
00:07:58,035 --> 00:07:59,393
Two at a time.

161
00:07:59,708 --> 00:08:01,511
Those count as four.

162
00:08:06,308 --> 00:08:07,171
Yeah.

163
00:08:07,507 --> 00:08:10,131
This is fun right?
We're outside, it's a beautiful day.

164
00:08:10,235 --> 00:08:12,072
The Indians are winning.

165
00:08:12,806 --> 00:08:15,100
I got to admit,
it is really nice to be outside.

166
00:08:15,286 --> 00:08:18,923
Yankee fans, please turn your attention
to the Diamond Vision for a special

167
00:08:18,928 --> 00:08:21,580
- seventh-inning-stretch surprise
- Oh, no.

168
00:08:29,956 --> 00:08:31,852
It's all a big lie!

169
00:08:32,006 --> 00:08:34,111
She's just going to break your heart.

170
00:08:36,258 --> 00:08:39,653
You can drag me out of here,
but she has no soul!

171
00:08:39,658 --> 00:08:42,260
We've tried everything--
baseball, strippers.

172
00:08:42,268 --> 00:08:44,340
The guy still won't eat a damn pancake.

173
00:08:44,347 --> 00:08:46,011
I think he's beyond repair.

174
00:08:46,116 --> 00:08:47,903
See, this is the problem with guys.

175
00:08:47,908 --> 00:08:49,530
You don't know
how to deal with heartbreak.

176
00:08:49,535 --> 00:08:52,172
Oh, and what's your prescription,
Dr. Estrogen?

177
00:08:52,178 --> 00:08:55,881
Eat Haagen-Dazs and watch Love Actually,
till your periods sync up.

178
00:09:02,206 --> 00:09:04,172
Yeah, that's the stuff.

179
00:09:04,506 --> 00:09:05,742
Oh, my God.

180
00:09:06,006 --> 00:09:07,411
How long have you been doing this?

181
00:09:07,458 --> 00:09:09,791
Well, my dad taught me to shoot
when I was a kid.

182
00:09:09,807 --> 00:09:12,330
Whenever I'm feeling lonely
or depressed, I come here,

183
00:09:12,337 --> 00:09:15,723
and it reminds me that... guns are fun.

184
00:09:20,008 --> 00:09:23,011
Um, you know,
Ted is kind of against guns.

185
00:09:23,217 --> 00:09:25,862
And that's why
Ted's never going to find out about this.

186
00:09:26,557 --> 00:09:29,751
Whoa, that sounded kind of scary
with me holding a gun, didn't it?

187
00:09:29,757 --> 00:09:32,120
No, I-I just mean, please don't tell Ted.

188
00:09:32,638 --> 00:09:33,950
You want to try?

189
00:09:34,608 --> 00:09:36,452
Only hell yeah.

190
00:09:37,095 --> 00:09:39,561
Oh, yeah, yeah, this is what I needed.

191
00:09:40,037 --> 00:09:43,310
I felt so powerless this whole time,
but this...

192
00:09:44,267 --> 00:09:46,712
this is power.
This is...

193
00:09:49,456 --> 00:09:51,243
I should of mentioned the recoil.

194
00:09:51,705 --> 00:09:54,723
I got to hand it to you, when he got home,
Marshall was smiling--

195
00:09:54,727 --> 00:09:56,011
did you sleep with him?

196
00:09:56,128 --> 00:09:58,861
'Cause I was actually, like,
three days away from suggesting that.

197
00:09:58,865 --> 00:10:02,211
Sometimes, all you need is to get in touch
with your feminine side.

198
00:10:05,106 --> 00:10:08,250
- Yeah, yeah!
- Well, congratulations.

199
00:10:08,258 --> 00:10:10,413
You're the first person
to cheer him up all summer.

200
00:10:10,488 --> 00:10:12,171
- You win.
- Oh, what do I win?

201
00:10:12,307 --> 00:10:14,462
I'll tell you what you win:
I'm taking you away this weekend.

202
00:10:14,468 --> 00:10:16,423
You are?
That's so nice.

203
00:10:16,428 --> 00:10:18,491
Yeah, my aunt and uncle
have a beach house out in Montauk,

204
00:10:18,496 --> 00:10:19,921
oh, it's really romantic.

205
00:10:20,035 --> 00:10:21,942
My uncle's had like three affairs there.

206
00:10:22,117 --> 00:10:25,790
Wow, must be a nice house,
I've seen pictures of your uncle.

207
00:10:27,405 --> 00:10:28,632
This is going to be so great.

208
00:10:28,635 --> 00:10:30,422
We'll finally get some time alone.

209
00:10:30,875 --> 00:10:32,832
Are you sure Marshall's
going to be okay with this?

210
00:10:32,835 --> 00:10:35,993
Yeah, absolutely.
Dude, I'm doing much better.

211
00:10:36,385 --> 00:10:37,812
In fact, take my car.

212
00:10:37,816 --> 00:10:38,812
- Really?
- Yeah.

213
00:10:38,816 --> 00:10:40,572
Hey, thanks... and, hey,

214
00:10:40,576 --> 00:10:42,872
if you need anything day or night,
just call me--

215
00:10:42,877 --> 00:10:44,693
You know what, please don't call me.

216
00:10:45,908 --> 00:10:47,271
What? What's wrong?

217
00:10:47,827 --> 00:10:49,672
It's, uh, Lily's credit card bill.

218
00:10:50,046 --> 00:10:51,970
She must have forgotten
to switch her address.

219
00:10:51,975 --> 00:10:52,743
So?

220
00:10:53,526 --> 00:10:56,452
So, I wonder what kind of charges
she's making out there in San Francisco.

221
00:10:56,458 --> 00:10:58,661
No. No, no good can come
from looking at this.

222
00:10:58,665 --> 00:11:00,912
- You've made too much progress already.
- I know but I just, maybe the--

223
00:11:00,915 --> 00:11:01,742
No!

224
00:11:02,786 --> 00:11:04,390
You're going to thank me for this.

225
00:11:07,506 --> 00:11:09,441
You're a good friend, Ted.

226
00:11:10,995 --> 00:11:13,583
August 5th, one charge-- tickets.

227
00:11:13,588 --> 00:11:17,673
To what? George Clinton
and the P-Funk All-Stars.

228
00:11:17,676 --> 00:11:20,552
August 10th, one charge: Tennis Emporium.

229
00:11:20,906 --> 00:11:25,032
August 18th, two charges: Mario's Bistro

230
00:11:25,037 --> 00:11:27,911
and, get this, Pet Palace.

231
00:11:29,408 --> 00:11:31,152
You guys see what this means, right?

232
00:11:33,907 --> 00:11:36,200
Wow, Mario's Bistro.

233
00:11:36,267 --> 00:11:39,112
What a perfect place to whore around.

234
00:11:39,208 --> 00:11:41,671
Only the best for my little Lily pad.

235
00:11:42,558 --> 00:11:47,062
Oh, funk legend George Clinton,
I am so glad you spotted me at your concert

236
00:11:47,067 --> 00:11:50,791
and dragged me on stage to dance
with you Courtney Cox-style.

237
00:11:50,926 --> 00:11:53,532
And I'm so glad you agreed
to play tennis with me.

238
00:11:54,766 --> 00:11:58,123
You know, Marshall tried to get me
to play tennis for nine years,

239
00:11:58,127 --> 00:12:01,572
but I didn't do it,
because I never truly loved him.

240
00:12:02,745 --> 00:12:04,103
I got you a gift.

241
00:12:06,608 --> 00:12:07,921
Oh ! A ferret.

242
00:12:07,926 --> 00:12:11,781
Oh, I'll buy it some food next door
at the Pet Palace.

243
00:12:12,007 --> 00:12:14,432
Oh, I've always wanted one,

244
00:12:14,438 --> 00:12:17,382
but Marshall had
this secret phobia of ferrets.

245
00:12:17,387 --> 00:12:20,281
I bet that's something
he made you promise not to tell nobody.

246
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:21,901
It was.

247
00:12:22,665 --> 00:12:23,661
Oh.

248
00:12:23,668 --> 00:12:26,491
I love you, funk legend George Clinton.

249
00:12:26,838 --> 00:12:28,512
I love you, too, Lily.

250
00:12:28,897 --> 00:12:31,163
That's right, Marshall, she's all mine.

251
00:12:31,386 --> 00:12:32,912
Now I'm gonna let her play with my hair.

252
00:12:32,916 --> 00:12:34,810
# Ow, we want the funk. #

253
00:12:35,426 --> 00:12:36,842
# Give up the funk... #

254
00:12:36,905 --> 00:12:38,723
That's the craziest thing I've ever heard.

255
00:12:38,728 --> 00:12:41,370
Yeah, why are you afraid of ferrets?
They're adorable.

256
00:12:41,408 --> 00:12:44,430
Because, Robin,
they're like fuzzy, tube-shaped rats.

257
00:12:45,208 --> 00:12:47,252
Plus, those charges are from,
like, a month ago.

258
00:12:47,258 --> 00:12:47,892
Exactly.

259
00:12:47,895 --> 00:12:50,050
For new charges,
you have to go to her online account.

260
00:12:50,216 --> 00:12:53,270
You can see credit card activity from,
like, two hours ago.

261
00:12:55,237 --> 00:12:57,581
But, you know, don't.

262
00:12:59,975 --> 00:13:02,602
Why do you talk?
Why do you talk?!

263
00:13:03,455 --> 00:13:05,480
He needs her password.
It's not like he has her password.

264
00:13:05,496 --> 00:13:07,381
Ooh, this is good, he has her password.

265
00:13:07,785 --> 00:13:12,272
There's a charge from earlier today:
the Kellett Hotel on 5th.

266
00:13:13,297 --> 00:13:16,253
I don't believe this.
Lily's back in New York.

267
00:13:20,008 --> 00:13:21,602
I can't believe this.

268
00:13:21,606 --> 00:13:23,280
Lily's in New York?

269
00:13:23,608 --> 00:13:26,603
I-I guess I've been thinking
when she got back, she'd call me.

270
00:13:27,088 --> 00:13:30,473
That's really the only reason I've been able
to hold it together so far this summer.

271
00:13:30,476 --> 00:13:32,411
This has been "holding it together"?

272
00:13:33,597 --> 00:13:34,832
Okay, you know what?
I'm calling her.

273
00:13:34,836 --> 00:13:36,132
- No.
- Ted, give me the phone.

274
00:13:36,138 --> 00:13:37,513
You're not calling her,
this changes nothing.

275
00:13:37,516 --> 00:13:38,831
You, come here.

276
00:13:40,006 --> 00:13:42,541
Look, while we're away this weekend,
can you keep an eye on him,

277
00:13:42,548 --> 00:13:44,102
make sure he doesn't call that hotel?

278
00:13:44,126 --> 00:13:45,450
You want me to babysit him?

279
00:13:45,748 --> 00:13:46,860
20 bucks.

280
00:13:47,197 --> 00:13:48,081
An hour.

281
00:13:48,088 --> 00:13:49,383
And money for pizza.

282
00:13:49,385 --> 00:13:53,013
Uh, yeah, how about you do it for free or
every time we hang out, you have to watch this?

283
00:13:53,017 --> 00:13:53,830
Come here.

284
00:13:53,838 --> 00:13:56,733
- My little blue-eyed baby, baby lips.
- Ooh, ooh, sugar, sugar...

285
00:13:58,006 --> 00:14:00,460
Okay, I'll do it!
Stop being a couple.

286
00:14:01,287 --> 00:14:03,092
- Marshall.
- Marshall, Marshall!

287
00:14:03,097 --> 00:14:04,910
Ted, I know I shouldn't do this,
but I have to!

288
00:14:04,916 --> 00:14:05,553
- You call her...
- We were together...

289
00:14:05,557 --> 00:14:06,842
- for nine years!
- ...and everything we've been working so hard for

290
00:14:06,846 --> 00:14:08,111
is completely flushed down the toi...

291
00:14:08,286 --> 00:14:10,152
Hello, Lily Aldrin's room, please.

292
00:14:11,247 --> 00:14:12,220
Thank you.

293
00:14:12,905 --> 00:14:14,040
- Hang up now.
- Ted, I can't hang up now.

294
00:14:14,045 --> 00:14:14,942
- Hang up now.
- The missiles are in the air,

295
00:14:14,948 --> 00:14:16,422
- and I know that you don't approve.
- Hang up.

296
00:14:16,426 --> 00:14:17,043
Hello.

297
00:14:23,705 --> 00:14:24,950
Uh, a guy answered.

298
00:14:25,708 --> 00:14:27,603
There's-there's a guy in her room.

299
00:14:29,948 --> 00:14:31,872
- I'm going down there.
- Dude, you can't do that.

300
00:14:31,878 --> 00:14:33,750
I have to go down there,
and I have to tell her I love her;

301
00:14:33,758 --> 00:14:35,232
I have to beg her to take me back,

302
00:14:35,238 --> 00:14:36,612
even if I have to get down on my knees.

303
00:14:36,618 --> 00:14:38,723
- Marshall, you can't do that.
- Oh, really, why not?

304
00:14:39,048 --> 00:14:40,480
56 days.

305
00:14:40,485 --> 00:14:42,940
That's how long it took me
to get right about here.

306
00:14:42,946 --> 00:14:44,890
Because you're pathetic!

307
00:14:47,277 --> 00:14:49,803
I'm sorry, but right now,
you are not Marshall.

308
00:14:50,347 --> 00:14:54,980
You are the miserable, whining,
shampoo-sniffing ghost of Marshall,

309
00:14:54,988 --> 00:14:58,321
and frankly, a guy like you doesn't have
a shot in hell with a girl like Lily.

310
00:14:58,538 --> 00:15:01,110
You know who might have a shot
somewhere down the line.

311
00:15:01,618 --> 00:15:02,601
Marshall.

312
00:15:02,608 --> 00:15:04,131
The real Marshall.

313
00:15:04,138 --> 00:15:06,003
But if you go down there
right now like this,

314
00:15:06,135 --> 00:15:08,643
you're going to blow it for him,
and he's never going to forgive you.

315
00:15:09,898 --> 00:15:12,193
Of course, whatever I say,
you're just going to do the opposite, so

316
00:15:12,196 --> 00:15:14,732
have a great weekend.
Good luck screwing up your life.

317
00:15:14,788 --> 00:15:15,872
Come on, Robin.

318
00:15:20,217 --> 00:15:22,323
Is it still okay if we borrow the car?

319
00:15:24,007 --> 00:15:26,571
Bold. Bold to go for the car.

320
00:15:30,305 --> 00:15:31,161
What?

321
00:15:31,547 --> 00:15:33,233
I didn't say a thing.

322
00:15:33,706 --> 00:15:35,480
You think I was too hard on him.

323
00:15:35,606 --> 00:15:37,070
I didn't say a thing.

324
00:15:37,076 --> 00:15:39,390
I can't believe you're accusing me
of being too hard on him.

325
00:15:39,406 --> 00:15:40,881
You're the one who said "tough love."

326
00:15:40,888 --> 00:15:43,431
Yeah, tough love,
not "hand the guy a noose."

327
00:15:43,437 --> 00:15:45,563
Oh, but it's okay
to hand him a nine millimeter?

328
00:15:46,465 --> 00:15:48,852
Yeah, he told me.

329
00:15:51,168 --> 00:15:52,631
So you're a gun nut?

330
00:15:52,635 --> 00:15:54,661
No, I'm a gun enthusiast.

331
00:15:54,666 --> 00:15:56,150
- Do you know how many people...
- The Second Amendment...

332
00:15:56,167 --> 00:15:57,652
- are killed each year in accidents...
- protects my right to bear arms...

333
00:15:57,655 --> 00:15:59,710
All right, all right, all right.

334
00:15:59,905 --> 00:16:01,311
I was too hard on him.

335
00:16:02,707 --> 00:16:03,673
A little.

336
00:16:06,896 --> 00:16:08,763
I'm going to call Barney,
see how they're doing.

337
00:16:09,898 --> 00:16:10,772
Go for Barney.

338
00:16:10,777 --> 00:16:12,103
Oh, hey, where are you guys?

339
00:16:12,106 --> 00:16:15,732
We're at a fundraiser, helping young women
raise money for community college.

340
00:16:15,736 --> 00:16:17,100
Strip club, nice.

341
00:16:17,296 --> 00:16:18,441
Is Marshall okay?

342
00:16:18,745 --> 00:16:20,662
Yeah, he's here and he's great.
Uh, hang on.

343
00:16:20,665 --> 00:16:22,190
Marshall?
Tell Ted that--

344
00:16:23,956 --> 00:16:24,613
Uh-oh.

345
00:16:24,617 --> 00:16:25,722
Already?

346
00:16:26,977 --> 00:16:28,271
What? What uh-oh?

347
00:16:28,277 --> 00:16:29,692
He's gone.

348
00:16:29,756 --> 00:16:30,893
You lost him?

349
00:16:30,898 --> 00:16:32,931
I can't believe this.
He's gonna go down to that hotel.

350
00:16:33,108 --> 00:16:35,413
Crap, you're right. Okay, okay,
here's the plan, here's the plan.

351
00:16:35,417 --> 00:16:37,502
You go down to the hotel and find him.

352
00:16:37,507 --> 00:16:39,600
I'll stay here and get a lap dance.
On three. One, two...

353
00:16:39,606 --> 00:16:40,471
Barney!

354
00:16:45,987 --> 00:16:48,290
Was there a hot tub at your uncle's place?

355
00:16:48,675 --> 00:16:51,062
A really nice one.

356
00:16:54,208 --> 00:16:56,662
Hi, uh, could you tell me
what room Lily Aldrin's in?

357
00:16:58,756 --> 00:16:59,693
Marshall.

358
00:17:00,187 --> 00:17:01,201
Hey.

359
00:17:03,205 --> 00:17:04,333
What happened?

360
00:17:04,497 --> 00:17:07,973
Well, I went up to Lily's floor,

361
00:17:07,978 --> 00:17:09,990
and I had this little speech in my head--

362
00:17:09,995 --> 00:17:14,732
everything I've been wanting to say to her
all summer about love, loyalty, respect.

363
00:17:15,008 --> 00:17:16,381
I knocked on the door.

364
00:17:22,726 --> 00:17:25,211
So you knocked out Lily's new boyfriend?

365
00:17:25,218 --> 00:17:26,110
Yeah.

366
00:17:26,398 --> 00:17:27,911
It wasn't Lily's boyfriend.

367
00:17:27,918 --> 00:17:29,542
What? Who-- who was it?

368
00:17:29,547 --> 00:17:31,411
His name was Joey Adalian,

369
00:17:31,417 --> 00:17:35,023
although he went by a number
of aliases in his years as an identity thief.

370
00:17:35,425 --> 00:17:37,273
Apparently, earlier in the summer...

371
00:17:37,636 --> 00:17:40,733
Oh, this is so embarrassing.

372
00:17:40,735 --> 00:17:43,051
I-I could have sworn I had some change.

373
00:17:44,068 --> 00:17:46,011
I know, I know.
I'm sorry.

374
00:17:46,806 --> 00:17:48,213
Oh, here we go.

375
00:17:49,007 --> 00:17:50,703
No, that's-that's a button.

376
00:17:50,905 --> 00:17:52,320
It was a button.

377
00:17:55,376 --> 00:17:58,390
- Do you, uh, take credit cards?
- Yes, I do.

378
00:17:59,108 --> 00:18:02,482
So Lily's not back in town,
and she doesn't have a boyfriend?

379
00:18:02,486 --> 00:18:03,911
Th-That's good news, right?

380
00:18:03,917 --> 00:18:04,790
Yeah.

381
00:18:05,908 --> 00:18:06,981
I don't know.

382
00:18:08,028 --> 00:18:11,693
Those credit card charges were the only
remaining connection I had to her.

383
00:18:12,876 --> 00:18:15,802
I don't know where she is
or what she's doing.

384
00:18:16,997 --> 00:18:20,602
She was my whole life, man,
and now she's-she's gone.

385
00:18:25,007 --> 00:18:27,873
You know, first day of college, I showed up,

386
00:18:27,877 --> 00:18:33,172
I was so freaked out, and-and I got up
to my room, and there was my roommate,

387
00:18:33,848 --> 00:18:36,281
lying on the bed
with his feet up on the wall.

388
00:18:36,307 --> 00:18:40,620
Had headphones on, big smile on his face
like he just didn't give a crap.

389
00:18:41,507 --> 00:18:42,472
Happy.

390
00:18:42,695 --> 00:18:43,820
Confident.

391
00:18:43,827 --> 00:18:45,420
Not afraid of anything.

392
00:18:46,315 --> 00:18:47,891
That guy was you.

393
00:18:48,305 --> 00:18:50,382
You before you met Lily.

394
00:18:52,547 --> 00:18:53,490
Ted?

395
00:18:53,928 --> 00:18:54,810
Yeah?

396
00:18:55,767 --> 00:18:57,232
I was high that day.

397
00:18:57,756 --> 00:19:00,381
I was. I was so high,
I thought you were the dean.

398
00:19:02,708 --> 00:19:10,103
Wh-What I'm saying is there's a version
of you without Lily, and it's not this.

399
00:19:11,208 --> 00:19:15,453
You can't let Lily steal your identity
the way that guy stole hers.

400
00:19:17,725 --> 00:19:18,860
Okay.

401
00:19:20,186 --> 00:19:22,252
Okay, resolved.

402
00:19:22,708 --> 00:19:25,941
Starting tomorrow,
I'm going to start being okay.

403
00:19:26,758 --> 00:19:28,140
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

404
00:19:35,307 --> 00:19:39,043
But he wasn't,
'cause that's not how life works.

405
00:19:39,126 --> 00:19:41,593
The next day,
he found one of her socks or something,

406
00:19:41,597 --> 00:19:43,383
and we were back to square one.

407
00:19:46,105 --> 00:19:47,863
And then, one morning...

408
00:19:47,867 --> 00:19:50,303
Ted, I think you should see this.

409
00:19:51,105 --> 00:19:52,653
Oh, no, what now?

410
00:19:54,505 --> 00:19:56,991
Marshall, what are you doing?

411
00:19:57,708 --> 00:19:58,652
It's Sunday.

412
00:19:59,538 --> 00:20:00,731
It's pancakes day.

413
00:20:05,905 --> 00:20:10,233
It took him 67 days and
one really disgusting batch of pancakes...

414
00:20:15,207 --> 00:20:16,330
So good.

415
00:20:17,007 --> 00:20:18,090
So good.

416
00:20:18,707 --> 00:20:21,253
...but Marshall
had come back from the dead.

417
00:20:21,705 --> 00:20:24,343
Because while baseball, strippers,
and guns can help,

418
00:20:24,647 --> 00:20:28,440
the only thing that
can really heal a broken heart is time.

419
00:20:28,448 --> 00:20:31,080
# I try to laugh about it #

420
00:20:31,088 --> 00:20:34,633
# Cover it all up with lies #

421
00:20:36,266 --> 00:20:39,471
# I try to laugh about it #

422
00:20:39,477 --> 00:20:43,112
# Hiding the tears from my eyes #

423
00:20:43,118 --> 00:20:49,703
# 'Cause boys don't cry. #
