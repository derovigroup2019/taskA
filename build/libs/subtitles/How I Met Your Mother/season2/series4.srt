1
00:00:01,768 --> 00:00:03,168
<i>Kids, sometimes
your relationship</i>

2
00:00:03,170 --> 00:00:04,603
<i>Goes so smoothly for so long</i>

3
00:00:04,605 --> 00:00:06,205
<i>That you think it will be
that way forever.</i>

4
00:00:06,207 --> 00:00:07,773
<i>It never is.</i>

5
00:00:07,775 --> 00:00:10,275
Well, we just had
our first fight.

6
00:00:10,277 --> 00:00:11,343
We had our first fight.

7
00:00:11,345 --> 00:00:13,178
Oh, no, what'd you fight about?

8
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:16,048
Oh, no, what'd you fight about?

9
00:00:18,685 --> 00:00:21,620
A few months ago, my
architecture firm was approached

10
00:00:21,622 --> 00:00:23,489
To design this new building...

11
00:00:23,491 --> 00:00:25,324
It's this big skyscraper
in spokane.

12
00:00:25,326 --> 00:00:26,992
It'd be a huge project
for his firm.

13
00:00:26,994 --> 00:00:29,395
And if we don't get it,
we could go under.

14
00:00:29,397 --> 00:00:32,231
So anyway, the head architect
unveils his new design

15
00:00:32,233 --> 00:00:33,565
To the whole company.

16
00:00:39,506 --> 00:00:40,506
No.
No.

17
00:00:40,508 --> 00:00:41,573
Yes.

18
00:00:41,575 --> 00:00:44,576
All skyscrapers
kind of look like a...

19
00:00:44,578 --> 00:00:48,247
Marshall, it's a 78-story
pink marble tower

20
00:00:48,249 --> 00:00:49,748
With a rounded top

21
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:52,584
And two spherical entryways
at the front.

22
00:00:52,586 --> 00:00:54,319
Wow, so it's the whole package.

23
00:00:54,321 --> 00:00:55,654
(laughs):
Yeah, you did.

24
00:00:55,656 --> 00:00:57,022
Had to.

25
00:00:57,024 --> 00:00:58,424
Oh, dude, if they're
selling condos,

26
00:00:58,426 --> 00:00:59,324
You got to get me in.

27
00:00:59,326 --> 00:01:00,759
And don't give me the shaft.

28
00:01:00,761 --> 00:01:01,994
Yeah, you did.

29
00:01:01,996 --> 00:01:03,162
Had to.

30
00:01:03,164 --> 00:01:04,730
It's a travesty.

31
00:01:04,732 --> 00:01:07,032
It's gonna define
the skyline of the city.

32
00:01:07,034 --> 00:01:09,401
If it was me, I could've
designed something amazing.

33
00:01:09,403 --> 00:01:11,236
Instead, I'm spending
12 hours a day

34
00:01:11,238 --> 00:01:12,271
Designing the cornices.

35
00:01:12,273 --> 00:01:13,372
Yeah, you did.

36
00:01:13,374 --> 00:01:14,654
That wasn't one.

37
00:01:30,924 --> 00:01:32,391
So you and ted
had your first fight.

38
00:01:32,393 --> 00:01:33,959
It obviously ended well.

39
00:01:33,961 --> 00:01:35,294
I mean, you're here with me.

40
00:01:35,296 --> 00:01:36,562
Actually, it didn't end at all.

41
00:01:36,564 --> 00:01:39,131
I started getting bummed
out, so I came here.

42
00:01:39,133 --> 00:01:40,232
It's what I do.

43
00:01:40,234 --> 00:01:41,867
When my grandma died,
I got a perm.

44
00:01:41,869 --> 00:01:44,536
Ooh, two tragedies in one day.

45
00:01:45,805 --> 00:01:48,474
The thing is,
ted has been literally

46
00:01:48,476 --> 00:01:50,709
Complaining about work
nonstop for weeks.

47
00:01:50,711 --> 00:01:52,744
So, when I came over today,

48
00:01:52,746 --> 00:01:54,213
I was kind of done.

49
00:01:54,215 --> 00:01:55,647
Hey.
Hey.

50
00:01:55,649 --> 00:01:57,382
How was your day?
Good.

51
00:01:59,452 --> 00:02:01,453
Wow, you're a great interviewer.

52
00:02:01,455 --> 00:02:02,754
Aren't you gonna ask
how my day was?

53
00:02:02,756 --> 00:02:05,457
No, I know how it was.
It was awful.

54
00:02:05,459 --> 00:02:07,159
Ooh, you want to rent
a movie tonight?

55
00:02:07,161 --> 00:02:09,428
You know, um...

56
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:11,463
I listen to your work
stories all the time.

57
00:02:11,465 --> 00:02:12,931
Yeah, but...

58
00:02:12,933 --> 00:02:14,466
And I don't want
to be rude here,

59
00:02:14,468 --> 00:02:16,668
But my work stories
are interesting.

60
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:19,404
I'm a television news reporter.

61
00:02:19,406 --> 00:02:20,973
Robin...
What?

62
00:02:20,975 --> 00:02:22,841
I knew exactly what
he was going to say.

63
00:02:22,843 --> 00:02:25,410
I was just helping him
get there faster.

64
00:02:25,412 --> 00:02:27,846
You should work at
a suicide hotline.

65
00:02:29,315 --> 00:02:30,782
And then it got ugly.

66
00:02:30,784 --> 00:02:34,253
What I don't do is tell you the
same story over and over again.

67
00:02:34,255 --> 00:02:36,255
I mean, you wouldn't
watch the same movie

68
00:02:36,257 --> 00:02:37,789
Over and over again, would you?

69
00:02:37,791 --> 00:02:38,791
Maybe

70
00:02:38,792 --> 00:02:40,959
A great movie like <i>die hard.</i>

71
00:02:40,961 --> 00:02:42,528
But <i>field of dreams?</i>

72
00:02:42,530 --> 00:02:44,363
Once is more than enough.

73
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,701
So that's your go-to bad movie?

74
00:02:49,703 --> 00:02:50,703
The number one

75
00:02:50,704 --> 00:02:52,204
Example on the tip
of your tongue

76
00:02:52,206 --> 00:02:54,873
Of a bad movie
is <i>field of dreams?</i>

77
00:02:54,875 --> 00:02:56,842
It's about ghost
baseball players.

78
00:02:56,844 --> 00:02:58,744
I think it's stupid.

79
00:02:59,812 --> 00:03:02,714
(stammers)

80
00:03:02,716 --> 00:03:06,118
So, now he's all mad at me
about the stupid movie.

81
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:09,221
Robin, he's upset because you
wouldn't listen to him,

82
00:03:09,223 --> 00:03:11,323
Not because you didn't like
some movie.

83
00:03:11,325 --> 00:03:13,559
How do you not like
<i>field of dreams?!</i>

84
00:03:15,395 --> 00:03:18,830
Listening is the foundation
of a relationship.

85
00:03:18,832 --> 00:03:20,699
And if he's really droning on,

86
00:03:20,701 --> 00:03:23,202
You can always practice saying
the alphabet backwards.

87
00:03:23,204 --> 00:03:25,504
You know, in case you get pulled
over for a dui.

88
00:03:25,506 --> 00:03:27,372
I guess I don't know
how to do that.

89
00:03:27,374 --> 00:03:29,675
Yeah, it's really hard,
even when you're sober.

90
00:03:29,677 --> 00:03:31,643
That's what I tried to explain
to the cop.

91
00:03:31,645 --> 00:03:35,013
No, I mean, I guess I don't know
how to do this girlfriend thing.

92
00:03:35,015 --> 00:03:36,682
I've never been in
a relationship

93
00:03:36,684 --> 00:03:39,551
This serious before.

94
00:03:39,553 --> 00:03:42,487
I should probably go tell him
I'm sorry, shouldn't I?

95
00:03:44,157 --> 00:03:46,225
You're trying to do it
right now, aren't you?

96
00:03:46,227 --> 00:03:48,660
What the hell comes before "q"?

97
00:03:49,729 --> 00:03:50,896
Then at the end of the movie

98
00:03:50,898 --> 00:03:53,398
When he has a catch with his
dad, like...

99
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:56,802
Like he never did when he was
young enough for it to matter.

100
00:03:57,737 --> 00:04:00,257
Can we talk about
something else?

101
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:02,341
You know what, dude?

102
00:04:02,343 --> 00:04:03,542
Forget about robin, okay?

103
00:04:03,544 --> 00:04:04,610
You're hanging with us tonight.

104
00:04:04,612 --> 00:04:06,445
I've got an awesome
party lined up.

105
00:04:06,447 --> 00:04:07,846
Oh, god.

106
00:04:07,848 --> 00:04:11,583
This gonna be another one of
your weird all-guy parties?

107
00:04:11,585 --> 00:04:14,319
That was a poker game.
What is wrong with you?

108
00:04:15,455 --> 00:04:17,256
No, it's the first law
school party of the year

109
00:04:17,258 --> 00:04:18,590
And it's gonna be awesome.

110
00:04:18,592 --> 00:04:20,559
I haven't seen this guys
since, like, last year

111
00:04:20,561 --> 00:04:21,960
Before lily and I broke up.

112
00:04:21,962 --> 00:04:24,529
So I'm gonna have to
break the news to everybody.

113
00:04:24,531 --> 00:04:26,698
It's really gonna bum them out.

114
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:29,001
This party's gonna suck.

115
00:04:29,969 --> 00:04:32,604
Well, love to join
you at that one.

116
00:04:32,606 --> 00:04:35,540
But I got tickets
to foxy boxing.

117
00:04:35,542 --> 00:04:39,211
But I got to get back
to my apparently boring job.

118
00:04:39,213 --> 00:04:40,646
Your job's not boring.

119
00:04:40,648 --> 00:04:41,880
Robin thinks so.

120
00:04:41,882 --> 00:04:44,249
Dude, lots of chicks think
architects are hot.

121
00:04:44,251 --> 00:04:46,551
Think about it, you create
something out of nothing.

122
00:04:46,553 --> 00:04:47,619
You're like god.

123
00:04:47,621 --> 00:04:49,721
There's nobody hotter than god.

124
00:04:49,723 --> 00:04:51,957
I love it when
you quote scripture.

125
00:04:51,959 --> 00:04:54,559
I'm telling you, you should use
the architect angle

126
00:04:54,561 --> 00:04:55,894
With the ladies.

127
00:04:55,896 --> 00:04:58,163
Okay, first of all,
I have a girlfriend.

128
00:04:58,165 --> 00:05:00,666
Second, the architect angle
doesn't even work on her.

129
00:05:00,668 --> 00:05:03,669
And, third, I can't imagine that
working on anyone ever.

130
00:05:03,671 --> 00:05:05,837
That's 'cause you're always
like...

131
00:05:05,839 --> 00:05:09,508
(flatly):
Ted mosby, architect.

132
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:10,475
If it were me,

133
00:05:10,477 --> 00:05:11,610
I'd be like...

134
00:05:11,612 --> 00:05:14,146
(suavely):
Ted mosby, architect.

135
00:05:15,448 --> 00:05:17,316
Anything sounds impressive

136
00:05:17,318 --> 00:05:19,084
When it's said with
the right attitude.

137
00:05:19,086 --> 00:05:20,118
(clears throat)

138
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:21,520
Marshall ericksen.

139
00:05:21,522 --> 00:05:23,588
Recently dumped and
heading to a lame party.

140
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:24,523
Whoa.

141
00:05:24,525 --> 00:05:26,825
Whoa, ladies,
please take it easy.

142
00:05:26,827 --> 00:05:28,193
There's enough of me
for everyone.

143
00:05:28,195 --> 00:05:30,529
Oh. Hi. Hello.

144
00:05:30,531 --> 00:05:32,464
All right.
We're gonna take off.

145
00:05:32,466 --> 00:05:34,826
Wait up, I'll leave
with you guys.

146
00:05:35,601 --> 00:05:37,636
Ted mosby, architect.

147
00:05:37,638 --> 00:05:39,398
(clucks tongue):
Trust me.

148
00:05:50,383 --> 00:05:51,950
Hey, just out of curiosity.

149
00:05:51,952 --> 00:05:53,785
If a guy told you
he was an architect,

150
00:05:53,787 --> 00:05:55,020
What would you think of that?

151
00:05:55,022 --> 00:05:56,455
Are you kidding?

152
00:05:56,457 --> 00:05:58,890
Architects are hot.

153
00:05:58,892 --> 00:06:01,860
How do you think mr. Brady
scored a babe like carol?

154
00:06:01,862 --> 00:06:03,528
Solid point.

155
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:05,330
She did have hair of gold.

156
00:06:05,332 --> 00:06:07,099
Yes, she did.
Mm-hmm.

157
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:13,538
Hey, carl, is ted still here?

158
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:14,706
No.

159
00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:15,907
Hey, lily.

160
00:06:15,909 --> 00:06:16,975
You still single?

161
00:06:16,977 --> 00:06:18,577
Yes.

162
00:06:18,579 --> 00:06:19,878
You know...

163
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:21,980
I've poured a lot of free drinks
for you over the years.

164
00:06:21,982 --> 00:06:23,248
A lot.

165
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:26,017
Carl, do you really want
to be with a woman

166
00:06:26,019 --> 00:06:27,753
Who would trade sex for beer?

167
00:06:27,755 --> 00:06:29,755
Only if you're into it.

168
00:06:31,357 --> 00:06:32,157
It's on me.

169
00:06:32,159 --> 00:06:32,858
Thanks.

170
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:34,860
I wonder where ted went.

171
00:06:34,862 --> 00:06:37,562
Ted mosby, the architect?

172
00:06:39,031 --> 00:06:40,098
Actually, yeah.

173
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:42,067
Oh, he is such a cool guy.

174
00:06:42,069 --> 00:06:43,502
He was here earlier.

175
00:06:43,504 --> 00:06:45,203
And what made you decide

176
00:06:45,205 --> 00:06:46,671
You wanted to become
an architect?

177
00:06:46,673 --> 00:06:49,574
Well, you know,
soul of an artist,

178
00:06:49,576 --> 00:06:51,676
Hands of a master craftsman.

179
00:06:51,678 --> 00:06:53,512
It was inevitable, I guess.

180
00:06:53,514 --> 00:06:56,114
I bet you can draw, can't you?

181
00:06:56,116 --> 00:06:57,582
(chuckles modestly)

182
00:06:57,584 --> 00:06:59,050
You should draw me.

183
00:06:59,052 --> 00:07:01,119
Well, I could try,
but you might end up

184
00:07:01,121 --> 00:07:02,721
Looking like
a midcentury tri-level.

185
00:07:02,723 --> 00:07:04,589
(laughing)

186
00:07:04,591 --> 00:07:06,892
Hey. If you want,
my friend marshall

187
00:07:06,894 --> 00:07:08,260
Invited me to this party
we could all go to.

188
00:07:08,262 --> 00:07:09,361
Marshall's great.

189
00:07:09,363 --> 00:07:10,562
He's just a lawyer,

190
00:07:10,564 --> 00:07:12,364
But somebody has to
push the paper around

191
00:07:12,366 --> 00:07:14,299
For us creative types.
Am I right?

192
00:07:14,301 --> 00:07:16,468
Yeah.
(laughing)

193
00:07:16,470 --> 00:07:18,370
He asked her to a party.

194
00:07:18,372 --> 00:07:20,238
Oh, my god, are you okay?

195
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,573
Okay? It's awesome.

196
00:07:21,575 --> 00:07:23,408
It's a win-win.
Ted got to vent

197
00:07:23,410 --> 00:07:24,709
And I don't have to hear it.

198
00:07:24,711 --> 00:07:26,311
Maybe after he's done
with the talkie-talk,

199
00:07:26,313 --> 00:07:28,146
He'll come over and
I'll get the fun part.

200
00:07:28,148 --> 00:07:30,148
What is wrong with you?

201
00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:33,919
God, I feel like I'm teaching
love as a second language here.

202
00:07:33,921 --> 00:07:35,120
Okay,

203
00:07:35,122 --> 00:07:36,555
You know how when he tells you

204
00:07:36,557 --> 00:07:38,423
Boring work stories
you're supposed to listen?

205
00:07:38,425 --> 00:07:41,927
Well, when he picks up
some random girl at a bar,

206
00:07:41,929 --> 00:07:43,562
You're supposed to freak out.

207
00:07:43,564 --> 00:07:46,932
I'm not freaking out because
in my mind, she's fat.

208
00:07:46,934 --> 00:07:48,867
She's a kickboxing instructor.

209
00:07:49,769 --> 00:07:52,571
Her ass looks better
than my face.

210
00:07:53,506 --> 00:07:55,707
All right, we'll
swing by the party.

211
00:07:57,577 --> 00:08:00,412
<i>Now the party was for some
of marshall's classmates</i>

212
00:08:00,414 --> 00:08:02,147
<i>From columbia law school,</i>

213
00:08:02,149 --> 00:08:04,149
<i>Who by day were
some of the sharpest</i>

214
00:08:04,151 --> 00:08:06,618
<i>And most serious young
legal minds in the country.</i>

215
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:08,186
<i>By night, however...</i>

216
00:08:08,188 --> 00:08:10,121
(loud music playing) ooh...

217
00:08:10,123 --> 00:08:11,490
Damn,

218
00:08:11,492 --> 00:08:13,258
These are some
drunk almost-lawyers.

219
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:14,192
Okay!

220
00:08:14,194 --> 00:08:15,327
Seriously...

221
00:08:15,329 --> 00:08:18,463
Who wants to shave my ass?!

222
00:08:18,465 --> 00:08:21,533
<i>That guy went on to become
a supreme court justice.</i>

223
00:08:22,535 --> 00:08:24,436
Okay, where are the guys
and the hooker?

224
00:08:24,438 --> 00:08:26,505
Yo, what's up, ladies?

225
00:08:26,507 --> 00:08:28,874
Welcome to the party. Yeah!

226
00:08:28,876 --> 00:08:30,775
Just need you to sign this
release protecting the host

227
00:08:30,777 --> 00:08:32,644
From any and all responsibility
should you harm yourself

228
00:08:32,646 --> 00:08:34,179
Or a third party.

229
00:08:34,181 --> 00:08:35,347
Then freakin' rage!

230
00:08:35,349 --> 00:08:36,848
Yeah!
Hey,

231
00:08:36,850 --> 00:08:38,283
Drunk legal dude, um...

232
00:08:38,285 --> 00:08:39,451
Have you seen marshall ericksen?

233
00:08:39,453 --> 00:08:40,986
He was with a guy named ted.

234
00:08:40,988 --> 00:08:42,988
You mean ted mosby,
the architect?

235
00:08:42,990 --> 00:08:44,823
Man, what a visionary.

236
00:08:44,825 --> 00:08:46,625
Yeah, they were here.

237
00:08:47,793 --> 00:08:50,795
Awards are nice,
they look good on my shelf.

238
00:08:50,797 --> 00:08:52,564
But none of that acclaim
means anything

239
00:08:52,566 --> 00:08:54,866
Compared to the joy
seeing the sun rise

240
00:08:54,868 --> 00:08:56,501
Over your first building.

241
00:08:56,503 --> 00:08:57,969
Wow.

242
00:08:57,971 --> 00:09:00,405
I would love to watch
the sun rise with you.

243
00:09:00,407 --> 00:09:03,008
I know you would.

244
00:09:03,010 --> 00:09:04,743
It's the job.

245
00:09:05,678 --> 00:09:06,912
Dude.

246
00:09:06,914 --> 00:09:08,813
You should let us
shave your ass tonight.

247
00:09:08,815 --> 00:09:10,682
No way.

248
00:09:10,684 --> 00:09:13,752
Hey, marshall, where's lily?

249
00:09:13,754 --> 00:09:17,522
I didn't want to ruin the party
for everybody this early,

250
00:09:17,524 --> 00:09:20,625
But, uh... Everyone take a seat.

251
00:09:24,397 --> 00:09:28,066
Um... Lily actually called off
the wedding this summer

252
00:09:28,068 --> 00:09:29,601
To go to san francisco.

253
00:09:29,603 --> 00:09:31,570
So...

254
00:09:31,572 --> 00:09:34,906
We're broken up.

255
00:09:34,908 --> 00:09:36,675
Her name wasn't on
your lease, was it?

256
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:38,944
'Cause if not,
new york state law,

257
00:09:38,946 --> 00:09:39,878
You're not obligated to give her

258
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:42,213
Half the deposit when you move.

259
00:09:42,215 --> 00:09:44,950
Yeah, that's not really the part
I was worried about, guys.

260
00:09:44,952 --> 00:09:46,712
And don't forget
the precedent set by

261
00:09:48,254 --> 00:09:50,355
Any personal effects
she left in your house

262
00:09:50,357 --> 00:09:53,558
Or dwelling become
yours after 30 days.

263
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:54,459
(murmuring)

264
00:09:54,461 --> 00:09:56,261
Guys, can we cease and desist

265
00:09:56,263 --> 00:09:57,729
With the lawyer speak
for a minute?

266
00:09:57,731 --> 00:09:59,598
Love died.

267
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,933
The love that made you all
believe in love,

268
00:10:01,935 --> 00:10:03,969
That's dead now.

269
00:10:06,639 --> 00:10:07,872
You should sue her.

270
00:10:07,874 --> 00:10:09,441
Uh, really?
On what ground, kara?

271
00:10:09,443 --> 00:10:12,777
On the grounds
of... Shut up.

272
00:10:15,281 --> 00:10:16,581
<i>That's our attorney general.</i>

273
00:10:16,583 --> 00:10:19,484
(giggling)

274
00:10:19,486 --> 00:10:22,487
See? Marshall's still
hung up on our breakup.

275
00:10:22,489 --> 00:10:24,289
Why? Because I listened to him.

276
00:10:24,291 --> 00:10:25,490
It was a strong,

277
00:10:25,492 --> 00:10:29,561
Nurturing relationship
that I threw away like old gum.

278
00:10:30,963 --> 00:10:32,430
Not that I'm worried
or anything,

279
00:10:32,432 --> 00:10:34,566
But, um, back to the sun rising
over ted and, uh...

280
00:10:34,568 --> 00:10:36,601
Oh, what tasteful way
did you describe her?

281
00:10:36,603 --> 00:10:38,770
The girl with the smackable ass.

282
00:10:38,772 --> 00:10:41,012
Yes, that's the young lady.

283
00:10:41,841 --> 00:10:44,175
So, I know the bouncer

284
00:10:44,177 --> 00:10:46,611
At this techno club, posers.

285
00:10:46,613 --> 00:10:47,912
Do you feel like dancing?

286
00:10:47,914 --> 00:10:49,080
Yeah, okay.

287
00:10:49,082 --> 00:10:50,615
There is no way
ted went dancing.

288
00:10:50,617 --> 00:10:52,350
Ted hates clubs.

289
00:10:52,352 --> 00:10:54,519
Hell, yeah.
I love clubs.

290
00:10:54,521 --> 00:10:56,788
I mean, I was going to
design a cathedral tonight,

291
00:10:56,790 --> 00:10:58,623
Kind of take a whack at
the whole relationship

292
00:10:58,625 --> 00:10:59,991
Between god and man conundrum.

293
00:10:59,993 --> 00:11:01,660
But sure, let's go dancing.

294
00:11:01,662 --> 00:11:02,794
(squeals) wait, let me
just check with my friend.

295
00:11:02,796 --> 00:11:04,663
Okay.
Hey, marshall.

296
00:11:04,665 --> 00:11:06,297
You up for some super loud,

297
00:11:06,299 --> 00:11:08,500
Repetitive music that hasn't
changed since the mid-90s?

298
00:11:08,502 --> 00:11:10,535
Um... Only always.

299
00:11:10,537 --> 00:11:12,704
Let's go.

300
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:16,241
Dancing? He went dancing
with this girl?

301
00:11:17,209 --> 00:11:18,977
Okay, maybe this is
a little bad.

302
00:11:18,979 --> 00:11:20,211
Dancing is bad.

303
00:11:20,213 --> 00:11:21,546
Dancing leads to sex.

304
00:11:21,548 --> 00:11:23,815
Did you grow up
in that <i>footloose</i> town?

305
00:11:23,817 --> 00:11:25,216
I'm calling him.

306
00:11:25,218 --> 00:11:27,819
I'm telling him that I
was wrong and I'm sorry,

307
00:11:27,821 --> 00:11:29,621
And I totally want to listen

308
00:11:29,623 --> 00:11:30,889
To his stupid stories.

309
00:11:30,891 --> 00:11:32,724
Yeah, think of another way
to phrase that

310
00:11:32,726 --> 00:11:33,792
And you'll be fine.

311
00:11:33,794 --> 00:11:36,861
He's not answering.

312
00:11:36,863 --> 00:11:38,863
Calling marshall.

313
00:11:40,499 --> 00:11:42,167
(synthesized dance music) hello.

314
00:11:42,169 --> 00:11:44,703
Marshall, hi, it's robin.
Can I talk to ted?

315
00:11:44,705 --> 00:11:46,504
Oh, robin, hi.

316
00:11:46,506 --> 00:11:49,307
Um, no, ted's not here tonight.

317
00:11:49,309 --> 00:11:50,542
He's, uh... He's working.

318
00:11:50,544 --> 00:11:53,912
Uh, okay. Bye.

319
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:57,682
Marshall just lied.

320
00:11:57,684 --> 00:11:59,884
Ted's cheating on me.

321
00:12:05,658 --> 00:12:07,258
Excuse me.

322
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:09,527
I'm looking for a couple guys
who came in here earlier.

323
00:12:09,529 --> 00:12:11,896
One's about six-four,
210, sandy brown hair.

324
00:12:11,898 --> 00:12:14,032
And the other's
a cheating bastard.

325
00:12:14,034 --> 00:12:16,501
You're going to need
to refresh my memory.

326
00:12:16,503 --> 00:12:20,705
Okay, fella, baby knows
how this game's played.

327
00:12:20,707 --> 00:12:23,007
How's a $20 help your memory?

328
00:12:23,009 --> 00:12:25,744
Thanks, but seriously,
it was crazy tonight.

329
00:12:25,746 --> 00:12:28,580
You really do need
to refresh my memory.

330
00:12:28,582 --> 00:12:29,981
Then can I have the...?

331
00:12:30,883 --> 00:12:32,717
That's cool. You keep that.

332
00:12:32,719 --> 00:12:34,719
So these guys...
One of them's an architect.

333
00:12:34,721 --> 00:12:36,454
Ted mosby, the architect?

334
00:12:36,456 --> 00:12:37,422
That's the one.

335
00:12:37,424 --> 00:12:39,624
Oh, yeah, he was here.

336
00:12:40,693 --> 00:12:42,460
And then I was all,
"no, frank gehry.

337
00:12:42,462 --> 00:12:43,728
You're on your
own this time."

338
00:12:43,730 --> 00:12:47,232
And that, my dear, was the
end of that hack's career.

339
00:12:47,234 --> 00:12:49,634
I live across the street.

340
00:12:49,636 --> 00:12:51,803
That is one hell
of a non sequitur.

341
00:12:51,805 --> 00:12:53,271
You want to come over?

342
00:12:53,273 --> 00:12:54,973
Well, I don't know.

343
00:12:54,975 --> 00:12:58,309
But I suppose I should at
least give you a ride home.

344
00:12:58,311 --> 00:13:00,578
Hop on.

345
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:01,613
I'll see you
at book club, vinny.

346
00:13:01,615 --> 00:13:03,481
I'll be bringing the crudit?s.

347
00:13:03,483 --> 00:13:05,950
Nice. Giddyap.

348
00:13:05,952 --> 00:13:07,652
Dude, dude, what are you doing?

349
00:13:07,654 --> 00:13:08,787
Galloping.

350
00:13:08,789 --> 00:13:10,555
You proved it, all right?

351
00:13:10,557 --> 00:13:12,957
The whole ted mosby,
architect things works.

352
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:14,726
Architects rule!
Whoo-hoo!

353
00:13:14,728 --> 00:13:17,495
Aren't you a little worried
that a certain somebody

354
00:13:17,497 --> 00:13:19,063
Might find out that
you're doing this?

355
00:13:19,065 --> 00:13:20,632
This isn't you, ted.

356
00:13:20,634 --> 00:13:21,766
It is tonight.

357
00:13:21,768 --> 00:13:22,934
(neighing)

358
00:13:22,936 --> 00:13:24,169
Whoo!

359
00:13:26,739 --> 00:13:28,807
You know this girl.
Where does she live?

360
00:13:28,809 --> 00:13:31,576
I'm not telling you that
for less than 20 bucks.

361
00:13:31,578 --> 00:13:33,778
Well, I'm out of money.
I'm cashed, too.

362
00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:36,247
I'll take your purse.
My purse?

363
00:13:36,249 --> 00:13:38,683
Yeah, my girl likes clutches.

364
00:13:38,685 --> 00:13:40,852
Okay, fine.

365
00:13:40,854 --> 00:13:42,754
You should tell her

366
00:13:42,756 --> 00:13:45,723
That looks really good
with a chocolate boot.

367
00:13:46,759 --> 00:13:49,127
Bitch is lucky I brought
my small purse.

368
00:13:49,129 --> 00:13:50,495
No room for my gun.

369
00:13:50,497 --> 00:13:51,930
Here.

370
00:13:51,932 --> 00:13:53,698
Now where does
the rodeo slut live?

371
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:56,634
The building with the green
light, apartment 3-c.

372
00:13:56,636 --> 00:13:58,937
Oh, my god, robin,

373
00:13:58,939 --> 00:14:01,139
Are you going to kick
this girl's ass?

374
00:14:01,141 --> 00:14:05,076
Yeah... And steal her purse.

375
00:14:08,214 --> 00:14:09,848
I can't believe
he's cheating on me.

376
00:14:09,850 --> 00:14:11,649
You know how many times
I could have cheated?

377
00:14:11,651 --> 00:14:14,953
And you know two of them,
and they would surprise you.

378
00:14:14,955 --> 00:14:16,888
(whispers):
3-c, let's do this.

379
00:14:16,890 --> 00:14:18,356
You ready?

380
00:14:18,358 --> 00:14:19,657
Should I just kick the door in?

381
00:14:19,659 --> 00:14:21,993
Those are really nice heels
and you already lost a purse.

382
00:14:21,995 --> 00:14:23,194
Let's see if it's unlocked.

383
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:25,964
(whispers):
It's unlocked.

384
00:14:25,966 --> 00:14:27,031
Okay, get in there

385
00:14:27,033 --> 00:14:29,901
And kick some spankable ass.

386
00:14:32,571 --> 00:14:33,838
Robin.

387
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:36,140
I'm the problem.

388
00:14:36,142 --> 00:14:37,475
What?

389
00:14:37,477 --> 00:14:38,643
You were right.

390
00:14:38,645 --> 00:14:40,178
I don't know how to be
a girlfriend.

391
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:41,913
I took the nicest guy
in the world

392
00:14:41,915 --> 00:14:43,348
And I made him a cheater.

393
00:14:43,350 --> 00:14:45,884
Well, don't stand out here
and beat yourself up.

394
00:14:45,886 --> 00:14:47,752
Get in there and beat ted up.

395
00:14:47,754 --> 00:14:50,154
I'll handle the slutty
kickboxer.

396
00:14:50,156 --> 00:14:51,689
Actually, I'll take ted.

397
00:14:51,691 --> 00:14:53,424
Let's do this.

398
00:14:53,426 --> 00:14:54,592
Bring it.

399
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:17,015
What do you think you're...?

400
00:15:18,450 --> 00:15:19,450
Barney?

401
00:15:19,452 --> 00:15:20,685
Thank god you're here.

402
00:15:20,687 --> 00:15:22,647
Can you help with this?
I need nails.

403
00:15:23,122 --> 00:15:25,256
Okay, I'm totally lost here.

404
00:15:25,258 --> 00:15:26,524
Where's ted?

405
00:15:26,526 --> 00:15:28,059
Ted? He's at work.

406
00:15:28,061 --> 00:15:29,694
How did you get here?

407
00:15:29,696 --> 00:15:31,930
Awesome story.

408
00:15:31,932 --> 00:15:33,765
As per usual.

409
00:15:33,767 --> 00:15:36,734
How do you think mr. Brady
scored a babe like carol?

410
00:15:36,736 --> 00:15:38,069
Solid point.

411
00:15:38,071 --> 00:15:39,771
And she did have hair of gold.

412
00:15:39,773 --> 00:15:40,805
Yes, she did.

413
00:15:40,807 --> 00:15:43,608
Sorry, I forgot my binocs
for foxy boxing.

414
00:15:43,610 --> 00:15:46,144
Whoo, looks like things just got
a little foxier right here.

415
00:15:46,146 --> 00:15:47,812
Yes, they did.
And you're just in time.

416
00:15:47,814 --> 00:15:48,814
Girls, I got to go,

417
00:15:48,815 --> 00:15:50,081
But I'm leaving
you in very good,

418
00:15:50,083 --> 00:15:52,550
If slightly sullied hands.

419
00:15:52,552 --> 00:15:54,285
Don't go. We don't
even know your name

420
00:15:54,287 --> 00:15:55,920
To look out for your buildings.

421
00:15:55,922 --> 00:15:57,822
Yeah, stay.

422
00:15:57,824 --> 00:15:59,424
Excuse us for one second.

423
00:15:59,426 --> 00:16:01,960
Okay, you were right...

424
00:16:01,962 --> 00:16:03,962
The architect thing totally works.
Mm-hmm.

425
00:16:03,964 --> 00:16:05,663
But I have a girlfriend,

426
00:16:05,665 --> 00:16:06,898
And I've got to get
back to work.

427
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:09,100
This project is getting
harder and harder.

428
00:16:09,102 --> 00:16:10,168
Yeah, you did.

429
00:16:10,170 --> 00:16:11,502
Yeah, had to.

430
00:16:11,504 --> 00:16:13,604
See ya.

431
00:16:13,606 --> 00:16:15,573
Sorry, my, uh...

432
00:16:15,575 --> 00:16:17,508
Intern had to leave.

433
00:16:17,510 --> 00:16:19,143
Oh, well, that's too bad.

434
00:16:19,145 --> 00:16:20,912
I'm anna, by the way.

435
00:16:23,482 --> 00:16:27,752
Ted mosby...
(clucks tongue) architect.

436
00:16:27,754 --> 00:16:29,854
But none of that acclaim
means anything

437
00:16:29,856 --> 00:16:32,290
Compared to the joy
of seeing the sun rise

438
00:16:32,292 --> 00:16:33,825
Over your first building.

439
00:16:33,827 --> 00:16:35,860
Giddyap.
(barney neighing)

440
00:16:35,862 --> 00:16:37,528
Dude, dude, what are you doing?

441
00:16:37,530 --> 00:16:38,830
Galloping.

442
00:16:38,832 --> 00:16:40,932
All right, you proved it.

443
00:16:40,934 --> 00:16:43,101
The whole ted mosby,
architect thing works.

444
00:16:43,103 --> 00:16:45,970
Architects rule!
Whoo-hoo.

445
00:16:45,972 --> 00:16:47,705
Aren't you afraid
a certain somebody

446
00:16:47,707 --> 00:16:48,773
Might find out about this?

447
00:16:48,775 --> 00:16:50,541
I mean, this isn't you, <i>ted.</i>

448
00:16:50,543 --> 00:16:52,243
It is tonight.

449
00:16:53,212 --> 00:16:55,346
And that led to a couple
of hours

450
00:16:55,348 --> 00:16:58,349
That I cannot, as a gentleman,
divulge to you.

451
00:16:59,451 --> 00:17:01,891
We did it right here,
and here and here.

452
00:17:03,989 --> 00:17:05,623
But why would you use
ted's name?

453
00:17:05,625 --> 00:17:08,493
I've had some recent
bad press on the world wide web.

454
00:17:08,495 --> 00:17:09,894
So I'm taking a t.O.

455
00:17:09,896 --> 00:17:11,936
On the whole
"using my real name" thing.

456
00:17:13,232 --> 00:17:14,732
Oh, this is great.

457
00:17:14,734 --> 00:17:15,734
It wasn't ted.

458
00:17:15,735 --> 00:17:17,335
Everything's okay.

459
00:17:17,337 --> 00:17:18,403
Everything isn't okay.

460
00:17:18,405 --> 00:17:19,737
Look at me.

461
00:17:19,739 --> 00:17:23,374
I'm acting crazy and jealous
and paranoid.

462
00:17:23,376 --> 00:17:26,177
This is how people act
in relationships.

463
00:17:26,179 --> 00:17:28,913
And that's why I avoid
relationships.

464
00:17:28,915 --> 00:17:30,982
Well, guess what,

465
00:17:30,984 --> 00:17:34,318
I haven't been crazy or jealous
or paranoid in months,

466
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:36,654
And I really miss it.

467
00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:40,258
And thus ended this chapter of,
"let's pour our hearts out

468
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:42,060
In the bedroom of barney's
one-night stand."

469
00:17:42,062 --> 00:17:44,362
Come on, let's go before
she gets out of the shower.

470
00:17:44,364 --> 00:17:45,263
You're such a pig.

471
00:17:45,265 --> 00:17:47,098
You're not even going
to say good-bye?

472
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:50,601
I'll have you know I composed
a lovely form letter

473
00:17:50,603 --> 00:17:52,483
For use in just
such an occasion.

474
00:17:53,739 --> 00:17:55,807
Just fill out her name
and then...

475
00:17:57,376 --> 00:17:59,877
Something with a "a."

476
00:17:59,879 --> 00:18:02,180
A... A...

477
00:18:02,182 --> 00:18:04,682
I'll just put "resident."

478
00:18:06,051 --> 00:18:07,385
(door creaking)

479
00:18:07,387 --> 00:18:09,120
Go, go, go, go.

480
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:17,695
<i>Robin took a long walk
that night.</i>

481
00:18:17,697 --> 00:18:20,431
<i>She thought about how opening
yourself up to another person</i>

482
00:18:20,433 --> 00:18:23,468
<i>Usually means opening yourself
up to going a little crazy.</i>

483
00:18:23,470 --> 00:18:27,772
<i>She thought about how much
easier it was just to be alone.</i>

484
00:18:27,774 --> 00:18:30,308
<i>And then she came to see me.</i>

485
00:18:30,310 --> 00:18:34,779
? And I am nothing
of a builder ?

486
00:18:34,781 --> 00:18:38,382
? But here I dreamt
I was an architect... ?

487
00:18:38,384 --> 00:18:41,719
Hey.
Hey.

488
00:18:41,721 --> 00:18:42,954
What are you doing here?

489
00:18:42,956 --> 00:18:44,322
I brought donuts.

490
00:18:44,324 --> 00:18:47,291
And I don't want to brag,
but they're filled with jelly.

491
00:18:47,293 --> 00:18:49,393
Thanks.

492
00:18:50,395 --> 00:18:53,998
So, uh... How was your night?

493
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
It was... Fine.

494
00:18:56,002 --> 00:18:57,301
Nothing exciting.

495
00:18:57,303 --> 00:18:59,070
How was yours?

496
00:19:00,572 --> 00:19:02,106
You really want to hear

497
00:19:02,108 --> 00:19:03,908
About boring architect stuff?

498
00:19:03,910 --> 00:19:05,543
Yes, I do.

499
00:19:06,512 --> 00:19:07,745
I'm sorry about earlier.

500
00:19:07,747 --> 00:19:10,581
To tell you the truth,

501
00:19:10,583 --> 00:19:12,517
I never even saw all
of <i>field of dreams.</i>

502
00:19:12,519 --> 00:19:13,784
I fell asleep half way through.

503
00:19:13,786 --> 00:19:16,621
What? The best part's
the last 20 minutes.

504
00:19:16,623 --> 00:19:18,523
Well, maybe they should have
moved that part up

505
00:19:18,525 --> 00:19:20,024
A little bit earlier, 'cause...

506
00:19:20,026 --> 00:19:21,492
You know what, um...

507
00:19:21,494 --> 00:19:24,295
What I'm trying to say is...

508
00:19:24,297 --> 00:19:27,098
I love being the person
you bitch to.

509
00:19:28,767 --> 00:19:32,503
So how was your day,
mr. Architect?

510
00:19:32,505 --> 00:19:34,505
Oh, I like the way you say that.

511
00:19:35,841 --> 00:19:38,176
Hey, you want to see
the building

512
00:19:38,178 --> 00:19:41,512
That will make every man in spokane
feel inadequate? Obviously.

513
00:19:43,715 --> 00:19:45,049
Wow.
Yeah.

514
00:19:45,051 --> 00:19:46,350
You know, you didn't mention

515
00:19:46,352 --> 00:19:48,519
All the foliage around the base.

516
00:19:48,521 --> 00:19:50,621
If you trim that back,
the rest would look bigger.

517
00:19:50,623 --> 00:19:52,790
You don't have to tell me.

518
00:19:52,792 --> 00:19:55,293
And, um...

519
00:19:55,295 --> 00:19:57,495
Just for fun, I've...

520
00:19:57,497 --> 00:19:59,630
I've sort of been
working on my own idea

521
00:19:59,632 --> 00:20:01,872
Of what I think
the building should be.

522
00:20:04,236 --> 00:20:05,870
What do you think?

523
00:20:05,872 --> 00:20:09,073
<i>You know that time we went
to spokane</i>

524
00:20:09,075 --> 00:20:11,409
<i>And I pointed out
that skyscraper?</i>

525
00:20:11,411 --> 00:20:13,978
<i>That was the first building
I ever designed.</i>

526
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:15,980
<i>And that night
was the first time</i>

527
00:20:18,584 --> 00:20:20,585
Wow.

528
00:20:20,587 --> 00:20:22,920
Ted, this is amazing.

529
00:20:22,922 --> 00:20:24,956
Thanks.

530
00:20:26,725 --> 00:20:28,893
It's not like it will
ever come to anything.

531
00:20:28,895 --> 00:20:30,928
I don't know.

532
00:20:30,930 --> 00:20:33,231
It might come to something.

533
00:20:33,233 --> 00:20:38,302
You know, girls find
architects very hot.

00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:48,045
Okay, but I don't want you
expecting 78 stories or anything.

535
00:20:48,047 --> 00:20:49,680
(giggles)

536
00:20:56,555 --> 00:20:58,256
Barney:
<i>"dear resident...</i>

537
00:20:58,258 --> 00:21:01,592
<i>"the time we spent together,
however long it was,"</i>

538
00:21:01,594 --> 00:21:03,227
<i>"meant the world to me."</i>

539
00:21:03,229 --> 00:21:07,131
"I would love to see you again,
<i>but unfortunately, I cannot.</i>"

540
00:21:07,133 --> 00:21:09,567
<i>"you see, I am a ghost."</i>

541
00:21:09,569 --> 00:21:12,270
<i>"I can only materialize
once every decade"</i>

542
00:21:12,272 --> 00:21:14,572
<i>"on the anniversary of my death."</i>

543
00:21:14,574 --> 00:21:18,376
<i>"I chose to spend my one day
among the living with you,"</i>

544
00:21:18,378 --> 00:21:19,744
<i>"sweet... Resident."</i>

545
00:21:19,746 --> 00:21:22,980
<i>"perhaps we will meet again
in another decade,"</i>

546
00:21:25,284 --> 00:21:29,854
<i>"Until then, all my love
from the beyond. Barney."</i>

547
00:21:31,323 --> 00:21:33,891
Barney?

548
00:21:33,893 --> 00:21:35,893
