1
00:00:10,106 --> 00:00:12,258
- So, I guess that decides it.
- Yup.

2
00:00:12,268 --> 00:00:13,704
Hanging out at a coffee place

3
00:00:13,714 --> 00:00:16,447
is not nearly as much fun
as hanging out at a bar.

4
00:00:18,414 --> 00:00:19,872
Man, what's that?

5
00:00:20,191 --> 00:00:21,382
What?

6
00:00:21,527 --> 00:00:25,260
That cute coffee girl
wrote a heart by your name.

7
00:00:25,270 --> 00:00:27,825
Somebody has a crush on you.

8
00:00:27,835 --> 00:00:30,804
Somebody thinks you're me.

9
00:00:31,425 --> 00:00:33,451
Do you really
think she likes me?

10
00:00:33,586 --> 00:00:35,340
I mean, I guess 
it's not that surprising.

11
00:00:35,353 --> 00:00:38,071
Every time I come in here,
I totally crack her up.

12
00:00:38,087 --> 00:00:40,093
Marshall, here's
your pumpkin latte.

13
00:00:40,109 --> 00:00:44,262
Wow. How did you fit a
pumpkin in this little cup?

14
00:00:45,709 --> 00:00:47,563
I'll have a pumpkin latte.

15
00:00:47,585 --> 00:00:50,023
How do they even fit a
pumpkin in those little cups?

16
00:00:50,038 --> 00:00:51,990
What? You got a shrink
ray back there?

17
00:00:52,826 --> 00:00:53,813
Yeah.

18
00:00:54,436 --> 00:00:56,863
Hey, remember that
time I said that thing

19
00:00:56,877 --> 00:00:59,731
about how do they fit a
pumpkin into that little cup?

20
00:00:59,745 --> 00:01:01,531
- Which time?
- The first time.

21
00:01:01,547 --> 00:01:04,491
Yeah. That was really funny.

22
00:01:04,648 --> 00:01:05,591
Right.

23
00:01:05,605 --> 00:01:07,531
All right, there's only two
reasons she'd laugh at that.

24
00:01:07,568 --> 00:01:09,971
One, it's the first
joke she's ever heard,

25
00:01:09,987 --> 00:01:12,911
or two, she likes you.
You should totally ask her out.

26
00:01:12,927 --> 00:01:13,521
You think?

27
00:01:13,537 --> 00:01:15,032
Yeah, that why you're not
back with Lily, right?

28
00:01:15,067 --> 00:01:17,511
So you can experience what
it's like to be single.

29
00:01:18,366 --> 00:01:19,990
Well, what if the heart
doesn't mean anything?

30
00:01:20,025 --> 00:01:22,001
What if she writes
it on all the cups?

31
00:01:22,016 --> 00:01:24,061
Mine says "Ted," no heart.

32
00:01:24,088 --> 00:01:27,091
Mine says... "Swarley."

33
00:01:27,958 --> 00:01:30,090
How'd they get
"Swarley" from "Barney"?

34
00:01:30,105 --> 00:01:31,193
It's not even a name.

35
00:01:31,206 --> 00:01:33,300
Who would ever be
called "Swarley"?

36
00:01:35,306 --> 00:01:38,242
Oh, please don't start
calling me "Swarley."

37
00:01:40,215 --> 00:01:42,661
This would never
happen at a bar!

38
00:01:44,556 --> 00:01:46,731
Man! What's up with Swarley?

39
00:01:46,747 --> 00:01:49,633
I know. You almost never see
old Swarlz get that upset.

40
00:02:06,257 --> 00:02:07,800
Hey, guess what?

41
00:02:07,818 --> 00:02:08,741
Oh, sorry.

42
00:02:08,757 --> 00:02:09,780
It's only my mom.

43
00:02:09,797 --> 00:02:11,931
She's just rambling
on like always.

44
00:02:12,428 --> 00:02:13,700
What happened?

45
00:02:13,716 --> 00:02:15,081
Marshall asked out a girl.

46
00:02:15,097 --> 00:02:16,101
Wow.

47
00:02:16,118 --> 00:02:18,100
Well, if anything,
that's Dad's fault.

48
00:02:18,115 --> 00:02:20,083
That'll keep her going a while.

49
00:02:20,095 --> 00:02:22,541
Oh, of course, you know,
he had a little help.

50
00:02:22,557 --> 00:02:23,631
Swarley hooked him up?

51
00:02:23,648 --> 00:02:24,732
Oh, good. You got my text.

52
00:02:24,747 --> 00:02:26,410
- Yeah.
- Oh. No, it was me.

53
00:02:26,427 --> 00:02:28,342
I gave Marshall
one of my secrets.

54
00:02:29,095 --> 00:02:31,142
- So, what she say?
- Nothing.

55
00:02:31,975 --> 00:02:34,831
I don't think she heard me.
It's pretty busy up there.

56
00:02:34,847 --> 00:02:36,631
What? You gave her
the look right?

57
00:02:36,646 --> 00:02:38,570
Head down, eyes looking up,

58
00:02:38,588 --> 00:02:40,710
hands in pockets, shoulders up,

59
00:02:40,727 --> 00:02:43,640
head slightly tilted,
conveying shy vulnerability.

60
00:02:44,288 --> 00:02:45,952
I think so.

61
00:02:51,916 --> 00:02:53,503
Look, can we just go?

62
00:02:53,985 --> 00:02:56,212
Pumpkin latte for Marshall.

63
00:02:57,377 --> 00:02:59,391
I didn't order that.

64
00:03:05,775 --> 00:03:08,112
Phone number.

65
00:03:09,045 --> 00:03:10,411
I love that look.

66
00:03:10,427 --> 00:03:13,130
I think I slept with you
because of that look.

67
00:03:13,146 --> 00:03:14,263
And it's fake?

68
00:03:14,278 --> 00:03:16,792
Oh, and you biting your lower lip,
shyly looking away

69
00:03:16,808 --> 00:03:19,331
and thrusting your
chest out is natural?

70
00:03:19,348 --> 00:03:21,012
Yeah, I hear you.

71
00:03:22,146 --> 00:03:23,720
- Hey!
- Hey, guys.

72
00:03:23,935 --> 00:03:25,742
Are you free tomorrow night?

73
00:03:25,757 --> 00:03:27,830
I was thinking of having
a wine tasting slash

74
00:03:27,848 --> 00:03:30,291
"help me catch the rat
in my apartment" party.

75
00:03:30,306 --> 00:03:32,990
That's a great idea.
You can put out cheese for both.

76
00:03:34,037 --> 00:03:35,883
I should invite
Marshall, right?

77
00:03:35,898 --> 00:03:37,222
It'd be weird if I didn't.

78
00:03:37,238 --> 00:03:39,290
Yeah, I don't think he can go.

79
00:03:39,317 --> 00:03:40,902
Really?  Why not?

80
00:03:40,917 --> 00:03:43,240
Uh, okay, um...

81
00:03:43,295 --> 00:03:45,480
Lily, we have to
tell you something.

82
00:03:45,496 --> 00:03:47,360
Marshall has a date.

83
00:03:48,007 --> 00:03:50,783
Oh. Well... good for him.

84
00:03:50,798 --> 00:03:52,140
Really? You're okay with it?

85
00:03:52,158 --> 00:03:54,090
Look, we've been broken
up almost six months.

86
00:03:54,105 --> 00:03:56,332
I mean,
I'm not thrilled about the idea,

87
00:03:56,345 --> 00:03:59,492
but he has every right
to date someone else.

88
00:03:59,507 --> 00:04:01,453
That's very mature.

89
00:04:01,465 --> 00:04:03,122
Why are you holding the phone?

90
00:04:03,136 --> 00:04:04,842
Oh, shoot.

91
00:04:06,026 --> 00:04:08,690
That's hilarious, Mom.

92
00:04:08,707 --> 00:04:10,833
Didn't even notice.

93
00:04:12,365 --> 00:04:15,021
Hey, dude, by the way,
I really like that suit.

94
00:04:15,036 --> 00:04:17,223
Tell me about the fabric.
Is it foreign or something?

95
00:04:17,236 --> 00:04:20,163
Wow. It is foreign.
I'm impressed, Ted.

96
00:04:20,177 --> 00:04:21,621
- It's Moroccan, actually.
- Whoa.

97
00:04:21,635 --> 00:04:24,131
I got a call for Swarley.

98
00:04:24,147 --> 00:04:26,281
Is there a Swarley here?

99
00:04:26,298 --> 00:04:28,342
You weren't interested in
my suit at all, were you?

100
00:04:28,355 --> 00:04:30,511
- Hmm?
- Swarley!

101
00:04:31,848 --> 00:04:34,842
Yeah, I know he's there.
It's really important.

102
00:04:34,856 --> 00:04:36,352
Could you ask again?

103
00:04:36,367 --> 00:04:38,443
Important call for Swarley!

104
00:04:38,458 --> 00:04:40,912
Geez, can't you hear him, Swarley?
There's a call for you.

105
00:04:40,927 --> 00:04:43,411
Stop calling me that.

106
00:04:43,425 --> 00:04:45,962
Uh... Hey, I'd like you guys
to officially meet Chloe.

107
00:04:45,977 --> 00:04:46,960
- Hi.
- Hi.

108
00:04:46,978 --> 00:04:47,862
Hi.

109
00:04:47,876 --> 00:04:49,393
It's nice to meet you guys.

110
00:04:49,408 --> 00:04:51,712
- I'll be right back.
- It's right back there.

111
00:04:55,915 --> 00:04:58,383
Right? Right? She's hot!

112
00:04:58,397 --> 00:04:59,860
And she likes me?

113
00:04:59,875 --> 00:05:03,163
She likes Italian food.
I also like Italian food.

114
00:05:03,176 --> 00:05:06,593
She likes Billy Joel.
I also like... music.

115
00:05:06,607 --> 00:05:09,553
And I think we're
going to go out again.

116
00:05:09,567 --> 00:05:12,132
- Dude, you gotta ditch her.
- Obviously.

117
00:05:12,596 --> 00:05:13,522
Why?

118
00:05:13,537 --> 00:05:14,832
She's got the crazy eyes.

119
00:05:14,845 --> 00:05:16,790
Dude. The eyes.

120
00:05:16,806 --> 00:05:18,492
They're crazy.

121
00:05:18,507 --> 00:05:20,500
What are you guys talking about,
the crazy eyes?

122
00:05:20,515 --> 00:05:24,582
It's a well-documented condition
of the pupils, or pupi.

123
00:05:24,598 --> 00:05:25,862
No. Just pupils.

124
00:05:25,877 --> 00:05:29,343
It's an indicator of
future mental instability.

125
00:05:29,358 --> 00:05:32,102
She does not have
the crazy eyes.

126
00:05:32,117 --> 00:05:33,821
You just can't see it
because you're afflicted

127
00:05:33,857 --> 00:05:36,733
with  "haven't been laid
in a while" blindness.

128
00:05:36,746 --> 00:05:38,603
She was too far away
in the coffee place,

129
00:05:38,615 --> 00:05:41,522
but when I saw her
up close just now...

130
00:05:41,537 --> 00:05:43,523
Hey, I'd like you guys to
officially meet Chloe.

131
00:05:43,537 --> 00:05:44,623
-  Hi.
- Hi.

132
00:05:44,635 --> 00:05:45,583
Hi.

133
00:05:45,597 --> 00:05:47,363
It's nice to meet you guys.

134
00:05:52,765 --> 00:05:54,553
You guys,
I'm not going to stop dating Chloe

135
00:05:54,566 --> 00:05:57,041
just because you think
she has the crazy eyes.

136
00:05:57,057 --> 00:05:59,102
You can keep going out with her,
but you're gonna regret it.

137
00:05:59,135 --> 00:06:01,563
One time,
I met a girl at this very bar.

138
00:06:01,578 --> 00:06:04,650
I saw that she had
the crazy eyes...

139
00:06:06,557 --> 00:06:07,830
...but I ignored it.

140
00:06:07,845 --> 00:06:10,181
And then, sure enough.

141
00:06:10,846 --> 00:06:12,920
Barney, can I ask
you a question?

142
00:06:12,935 --> 00:06:14,411
Anything.

143
00:06:14,766 --> 00:06:17,430
Would you like to
have a threesome?

144
00:06:17,773 --> 00:06:19,081
Of course.

145
00:06:19,097 --> 00:06:21,853
Great. It'll be you,
me and Mr. Weasels.

146
00:06:24,099 --> 00:06:25,702
So, did you do it?

147
00:06:25,719 --> 00:06:28,211
No. It ended up
being just a twosome

148
00:06:28,225 --> 00:06:30,580
with the third one
watching from a chair.

149
00:06:31,016 --> 00:06:32,622
Which one were you?

150
00:06:33,447 --> 00:06:35,202
I'd rather not say.

151
00:06:35,516 --> 00:06:38,062
Look, there was a time I didn't
believe in the crazy eyes either,

152
00:06:38,096 --> 00:06:40,012
and then I met Jeanine.

153
00:06:40,078 --> 00:06:42,771
She had serious crazy eyes.

154
00:06:43,228 --> 00:06:46,660
I told myself I was 
just imagining it, but then...

155
00:06:46,675 --> 00:06:48,440
So, should we go get a drink?

156
00:06:48,458 --> 00:06:50,860
As long as it's in
your apartment.

157
00:06:52,125 --> 00:06:53,183
Whoa, I'm sorry.

158
00:06:53,195 --> 00:06:58,103
Watch! Where! You're! Going!

159
00:06:59,998 --> 00:07:02,190
So, where do you live?

160
00:07:03,026 --> 00:07:05,832
You guys, Chloe is not 
gonna do any of that stuff.

161
00:07:05,848 --> 00:07:07,642
She's a nice girl
from Nebraska.

162
00:07:07,658 --> 00:07:08,852
She's not crazy.

163
00:07:08,866 --> 00:07:11,022
She's... she's awesome.

164
00:07:11,036 --> 00:07:13,242
But you can't avoid
the crazy eyes forever.

165
00:07:13,255 --> 00:07:16,180
Sooner or later, the crazy 
comes bubbling to the surface.

166
00:07:16,197 --> 00:07:16,982
Hello?

167
00:07:16,998 --> 00:07:18,622
Marshall, it's Chloe.

168
00:07:18,638 --> 00:07:21,232
Are you the one who's
called me like nine times?

169
00:07:21,248 --> 00:07:23,342
Yeah. Could you come get me?

170
00:07:23,355 --> 00:07:25,803
I'm in the middle
of taking a test.

171
00:07:25,818 --> 00:07:27,770
Please. I'm so scared.

172
00:07:28,017 --> 00:07:29,433
Well, what's going on?

173
00:07:29,448 --> 00:07:31,462
This weird midget guy
started following me

174
00:07:31,485 --> 00:07:32,653
and he was screaming at me

175
00:07:32,668 --> 00:07:34,890
and he had a limp and
a big hump on his back

176
00:07:34,908 --> 00:07:36,302
and the police
didn't believe me

177
00:07:36,315 --> 00:07:39,150
and I almost got trampled
by a horse and...

178
00:07:39,168 --> 00:07:42,040
God I must sound totally
crazy to you right now.

179
00:07:42,655 --> 00:07:45,010
No. Pfft.

180
00:07:45,027 --> 00:07:46,302
Not at all.

181
00:07:46,927 --> 00:07:48,652
So, she's needy crazy.

182
00:07:48,668 --> 00:07:50,440
That's one of the worst kinds.

183
00:07:50,457 --> 00:07:51,761
I've had one of those.

184
00:07:51,777 --> 00:07:53,462
Makes up stories
to get attention.

185
00:07:53,475 --> 00:07:56,662
Went out with her for three weeks--
her dad died twice.

186
00:07:56,676 --> 00:07:59,510
Guys, she was really
freaked out, okay?

187
00:07:59,528 --> 00:08:01,081
Maybe the story is true.

188
00:08:01,096 --> 00:08:03,833
What in the world would make
you believe that's a true story?

189
00:08:03,847 --> 00:08:06,373
She's really hot.

190
00:08:06,445 --> 00:08:08,690
They always are.

191
00:08:09,965 --> 00:08:11,603
- You all done with that, Ted?
- Yeah.

192
00:08:11,617 --> 00:08:14,313
Ned. I told you
to call him Ned.

193
00:08:14,466 --> 00:08:16,322
That's just sad.

194
00:08:16,335 --> 00:08:18,103
Sorry, Swarley.

195
00:08:19,357 --> 00:08:21,833
So, do just you
and Ted live here

196
00:08:21,848 --> 00:08:23,613
or does Swarley live here, too?

197
00:08:23,627 --> 00:08:26,551
Nah. Swarley has his own place.

198
00:08:29,918 --> 00:08:30,943
What was that?

199
00:08:30,955 --> 00:08:32,673
Oh, I, uh, dropped my keys.

200
00:08:34,835 --> 00:08:36,561
So, here you go.

201
00:08:36,576 --> 00:08:39,012
Two pumpkin beers.

202
00:08:39,168 --> 00:08:41,880
I was joking.
They're regular beers.

203
00:08:44,738 --> 00:08:46,402
What is that?

204
00:08:53,308 --> 00:08:55,190
This picture is broken.

205
00:08:55,206 --> 00:08:58,100
Oh. That's too bad.

206
00:08:58,117 --> 00:08:59,922
Is that Lily?

207
00:08:59,938 --> 00:09:02,222
Is that the girl you
were going to marry?

208
00:09:02,238 --> 00:09:04,392
Yeah.  Is that what
that sound was?

209
00:09:04,408 --> 00:09:06,633
Did you just smash this?

210
00:09:06,645 --> 00:09:07,930
No.

211
00:09:07,946 --> 00:09:10,222
Why would I do that?

212
00:09:11,237 --> 00:09:13,561
Let me look into your eyes.

213
00:09:14,076 --> 00:09:15,732
Okay.

214
00:09:18,708 --> 00:09:21,300
I had a really
nice time tonight.

215
00:09:21,315 --> 00:09:23,592
Yeah, me, too. Stop blinking.

216
00:09:23,928 --> 00:09:27,372
I like your eyes a lot, too.

217
00:09:29,376 --> 00:09:30,640
Stop!

218
00:09:34,208 --> 00:09:36,891
Hi. I'm Lily.

219
00:09:40,178 --> 00:09:42,122
Stop!

220
00:09:42,136 --> 00:09:44,220
Now, kids,
I know Lily hiding in the apartment

221
00:09:44,235 --> 00:09:47,520
while Marshall was on a date with
another girl seems pretty crazy,

222
00:09:47,538 --> 00:09:49,880
but when you hear her
side of the story,

223
00:09:49,897 --> 00:09:51,950
well, it's still pretty crazy.

224
00:09:52,627 --> 00:09:54,180
What's up Swarlz?

225
00:09:54,196 --> 00:09:56,402
No. Okay? No. No more.

226
00:09:56,418 --> 00:09:58,473
I will not let this 
become a thing. It's over.

227
00:09:58,487 --> 00:10:00,450
No more Swarley. No Swarlz.

228
00:10:00,466 --> 00:10:02,942
No more Swar-lay.

229
00:10:02,957 --> 00:10:05,920
No more Swar...
wait for it... ley.

230
00:10:05,938 --> 00:10:08,510
No more Bob Swarley, mon.

231
00:10:08,526 --> 00:10:11,471
No more. No! It's over.

232
00:10:11,485 --> 00:10:13,061
Do you understand?

233
00:10:13,078 --> 00:10:13,903
- Yes.
- Yes.

234
00:10:13,917 --> 00:10:15,413
Thank you.

235
00:10:18,135 --> 00:10:19,003
Nice.

236
00:10:19,017 --> 00:10:21,191
- Why didn't you call me?
- Was I supposed to call you?

237
00:10:21,207 --> 00:10:24,460
Yes, about the whole Marshall-
dating-another-girl thing.

238
00:10:24,477 --> 00:10:25,590
You said you were fine with it.

239
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:28,623
Yeah, in front of Ted,
but then I shot you a look.

240
00:10:28,638 --> 00:10:30,972
- What look?
- This.

241
00:10:32,808 --> 00:10:34,511
That doesn't seem like a look.

242
00:10:34,526 --> 00:10:37,103
Yes it is. It means, 
"I'm upset call me later."

243
00:10:37,115 --> 00:10:39,382
You should have pulled me aside
and told me what the look meant.

244
00:10:39,417 --> 00:10:41,262
If I pulled you aside,
I wouldn't need the look.

245
00:10:41,297 --> 00:10:42,523
Well, maybe if it was a
more distinctive look...

246
00:10:42,556 --> 00:10:44,390
Okay, the look isn't important.

247
00:10:44,405 --> 00:10:47,472
What's important is that
I can't stand the idea

248
00:10:47,486 --> 00:10:49,222
of Marshall dating
another woman.

249
00:10:49,238 --> 00:10:51,703
I mean, what if 
he falls in love with her?

250
00:10:51,715 --> 00:10:53,490
Well, if it makes
you feel any better,

251
00:10:53,508 --> 00:10:56,051
Ted says she has
the crazy eyes.

252
00:10:56,065 --> 00:10:56,781
What's that?

253
00:10:56,795 --> 00:10:59,171
Apparently, a thing women
have that guys can see

254
00:10:59,186 --> 00:11:01,062
and it tells them that
the girl's crazy.

255
00:11:01,078 --> 00:11:03,753
Oh, kind of like how you
never want to date a guy

256
00:11:03,768 --> 00:11:05,120
with perfect fingernails?

257
00:11:05,135 --> 00:11:07,002
Jerk nails. Exactly.

258
00:11:07,016 --> 00:11:10,332
Well, did-did Ted say
whether she was good-looking?

259
00:11:10,348 --> 00:11:11,912
I mean,
'cause if I knew she was ugly,

260
00:11:11,928 --> 00:11:14,022
then maybe I wouldn't
be so freaked out.

261
00:11:14,037 --> 00:11:16,293
Uh, he didn't say,
but you can find out.

262
00:11:16,306 --> 00:11:19,811
I think her name is Chloe--
she works at Cosa Coffee on 78th.

263
00:11:19,828 --> 00:11:23,241
Phone call for Swarles Barkley?

264
00:11:24,867 --> 00:11:26,800
Hey, Ted. No, he's not here.

265
00:11:26,817 --> 00:11:29,033
Good one, though--
remember that one.

266
00:11:34,648 --> 00:11:36,620
Is, um, Chloe here?

267
00:11:36,637 --> 00:11:38,853
She just left.
You can probably still catch her.

268
00:11:38,865 --> 00:11:41,642
She's easy to spot--
she's got a pink umbrella.

269
00:11:41,655 --> 00:11:43,301
Oh, thanks, Brian.

270
00:11:43,318 --> 00:11:44,953
My name is Scott.

271
00:11:44,965 --> 00:11:46,731
Your tag says Brian.

272
00:11:46,746 --> 00:11:48,233
I know. Funny story.

273
00:11:48,246 --> 00:11:49,662
So,  I wake up this
morning, and...

274
00:11:49,677 --> 00:11:51,673
Yeah, see you later, Brian.

275
00:12:01,136 --> 00:12:02,701
There she is.

276
00:12:02,717 --> 00:12:04,633
She doesn't look that great.

277
00:12:04,646 --> 00:12:07,020
She's not fat,
but that doesn't mean anything.

278
00:12:07,038 --> 00:12:09,530
I know tons of skinny,
ugly women.

279
00:12:09,545 --> 00:12:12,181
That's right,
snotty girl in my yoga class,

280
00:12:12,195 --> 00:12:14,442
I'm talking to you.

281
00:12:14,455 --> 00:12:18,051
Come on, Chloe, turn around.

282
00:12:18,396 --> 00:12:20,843
Here we go. Turn around, Chloe.

283
00:12:20,856 --> 00:12:24,582
Come on,
show me that hideous face.

284
00:12:24,625 --> 00:12:26,473
Damn it!

285
00:12:26,535 --> 00:12:28,941
Ooh, I know,
I'll get ahead of her,

286
00:12:28,955 --> 00:12:31,371
then I'll cut back so I... Aah!

287
00:12:31,385 --> 00:12:34,083
Oh, my God, that hurts!

288
00:12:34,326 --> 00:12:37,233
Turn around! Come on!

289
00:12:37,246 --> 00:12:39,141
Just turn around!

290
00:12:39,156 --> 00:12:41,530
Okay, this is ridiculous.

291
00:12:41,547 --> 00:12:43,280
Hey!

292
00:12:45,855 --> 00:12:48,521
Turn around!
What's the matter with you?

293
00:12:48,545 --> 00:12:50,611
Hey, you!

294
00:12:52,055 --> 00:12:53,960
Turn around!

295
00:12:55,515 --> 00:12:58,162
Turn around, Chloe!

296
00:13:03,976 --> 00:13:06,512
She's hot? I'm so sorry.

297
00:13:06,526 --> 00:13:07,902
No, it's fine.

298
00:13:07,918 --> 00:13:09,713
I-It just makes things easier.

299
00:13:09,727 --> 00:13:11,393
Now that I know she's a threat,

300
00:13:11,408 --> 00:13:14,463
all I have to do is keep Marshall
from ever seeing her again.

301
00:13:14,478 --> 00:13:16,763
Okay, I have two plans--
you can help me choose.

302
00:13:16,778 --> 00:13:17,930
Plan A--

303
00:13:17,945 --> 00:13:20,751
remember that time Marshall
and I had sex in the bathroom?

304
00:13:20,768 --> 00:13:22,731
Oops, I got knocked up.

305
00:13:22,746 --> 00:13:24,871
- Lily.
- Okay, plan B

306
00:13:24,886 --> 00:13:27,193
is called "Chloe's Accident."

307
00:13:27,207 --> 00:13:28,681
- Just stop.
- What?

308
00:13:28,698 --> 00:13:31,002
Lily, you can't do
any of those things.

309
00:13:31,015 --> 00:13:32,770
If you two are ever
gonna get back together,

310
00:13:32,776 --> 00:13:35,632
you have to let him work
out whatever this is.

311
00:13:35,645 --> 00:13:38,001
I know. You're right.

312
00:13:38,017 --> 00:13:40,201
Now, come on,
Ted asked us to be upstairs at 6:00.

313
00:13:40,218 --> 00:13:42,230
Some surprise for Barney.

314
00:13:42,245 --> 00:13:44,232
- Barney?
- Uh, Swarley.

315
00:13:45,527 --> 00:13:47,863
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.

316
00:13:47,877 --> 00:13:49,232
Where's Marshall?

317
00:13:49,247 --> 00:13:50,621
Oh, he's getting a haircut.

318
00:13:50,637 --> 00:13:52,830
Oh. For his date.

319
00:13:52,847 --> 00:13:54,391
Good for him.

320
00:13:54,405 --> 00:13:56,271
Hope he has a good
time tonight.

321
00:13:56,285 --> 00:13:58,151
Relax, you've got
nothing to worry about.

322
00:13:58,165 --> 00:13:59,601
The girl's crazy.

323
00:13:59,616 --> 00:14:01,151
Thanks!

324
00:14:01,168 --> 00:14:03,590
He'll just have wild monkey
sex with her five times, max,

325
00:14:03,606 --> 00:14:05,011
and be done with her.

326
00:14:05,027 --> 00:14:06,601
Thanks again.

327
00:14:08,466 --> 00:14:09,811
What are you doing?

328
00:14:09,826 --> 00:14:13,020
I just wanted to listen to
a little music, that's all.

329
00:14:13,036 --> 00:14:15,591
And this next one's
going out to Swarley.

330
00:14:15,608 --> 00:14:17,493
All your friends know
you miss Barney,

331
00:14:17,508 --> 00:14:20,051
but he's gone,
and you got to accept that, baby.

332
00:14:20,068 --> 00:14:22,942
And, Swarley, you're gonna be 
a better woman for it.

333
00:14:22,957 --> 00:14:26,030
Here's "I Am Woman"
by Helen Reddy.

334
00:14:26,047 --> 00:14:29,831
Ha-ha! Now I'm a woman.
I love it!

335
00:14:29,846 --> 00:14:32,630
You know, I was thinking about this
whole new name thing last night,

336
00:14:32,646 --> 00:14:34,852
and you know what I realized?
I like it.

337
00:14:34,867 --> 00:14:36,570
You like being called Swarley?

338
00:14:36,588 --> 00:14:38,422
Are you kidding?
I want you to call me that.

339
00:14:38,437 --> 00:14:39,710
Do you really think
this is gonna work?

340
00:14:39,746 --> 00:14:42,141
Do I think what's gonna work?
I'm just saying, I love my new name,

341
00:14:42,176 --> 00:14:45,480
so please only call
me that from now on.

342
00:14:45,927 --> 00:14:47,771
Call you what?

343
00:14:47,948 --> 00:14:52,160
You know, that-that-that new name
that you've been calling me.

344
00:14:52,178 --> 00:14:53,532
Say it.

345
00:14:53,546 --> 00:14:55,392
Why? You guys know what it is.

346
00:14:55,405 --> 00:14:57,083
Say the name.

347
00:14:57,996 --> 00:15:00,613
No, I don't want to! I hate it!

348
00:15:00,627 --> 00:15:03,091
I hate it! It's not funny!

349
00:15:03,107 --> 00:15:05,543
It's never been funny!
I've never done any...

350
00:15:05,556 --> 00:15:07,081
No!

351
00:15:07,735 --> 00:15:09,832
Man, he is really gonna lose it

352
00:15:09,845 --> 00:15:12,811
when all the magazine
subscriptions start coming in.

353
00:15:12,876 --> 00:15:15,423
I signed him up for
People in Espanol,

354
00:15:15,438 --> 00:15:18,220
but I addressed it to Swarlos.

355
00:15:18,236 --> 00:15:21,860
Hey, where's the picture of
Marshall and me at the pier?

356
00:15:21,876 --> 00:15:23,973
Didn't it used to
be by that window?

357
00:15:23,986 --> 00:15:27,483
Oh, yeah, he, uh,
he sort of took it down when you left.

358
00:15:27,498 --> 00:15:29,233
Put it behind some books,
I think.

359
00:15:29,245 --> 00:15:31,560
Oh, well-well,
maybe I should put it back up.

360
00:15:31,576 --> 00:15:33,620
Why, so Chloe'll see
it and get scared off?

361
00:15:33,637 --> 00:15:34,732
No.

362
00:15:34,745 --> 00:15:37,343
So Marshall'll see
it and feel guilty.

363
00:15:38,338 --> 00:15:40,293
Yeah, okay.

364
00:15:40,437 --> 00:15:42,472
But she wasn't okay.

365
00:15:42,487 --> 00:15:45,201
Later that night,
while Marshall was on his date,

366
00:15:45,215 --> 00:15:47,403
Lily came back.

367
00:16:04,087 --> 00:16:05,942
...anymore.

368
00:16:05,955 --> 00:16:07,653
Pretty impressive, huh?

369
00:16:07,667 --> 00:16:11,680
Wow, you really did memorize all the
lyrics to "We Didn't Start the Fire."

370
00:16:12,045 --> 00:16:13,850
Can I, uh,
can I get you a drink?

371
00:16:13,866 --> 00:16:15,280
I'd love a beer.

372
00:16:15,297 --> 00:16:16,991
You got it.

373
00:16:19,586 --> 00:16:22,191
Lily did what any
sensible woman would do.

374
00:16:22,205 --> 00:16:24,541
She hid under the desk.

375
00:16:25,015 --> 00:16:27,342
And she stayed there,
listening to her ex-fiance

376
00:16:27,357 --> 00:16:29,562
on a date with another woman.

377
00:16:29,715 --> 00:16:32,192
I had a really
nice time tonight.

378
00:16:32,205 --> 00:16:34,240
Yeah, me, too. Stop blinking.

379
00:16:34,257 --> 00:16:36,941
I like your eyes a lot, too.

380
00:16:36,957 --> 00:16:39,620
Finally, much like Billy Joel,

381
00:16:39,635 --> 00:16:41,331
she couldn't take it anymore.

382
00:16:41,346 --> 00:16:43,150
Stop!

383
00:16:45,376 --> 00:16:48,090
Hi. I'm Lily.

384
00:16:50,226 --> 00:16:52,760
Lily... Lily,
what the hell are you doing?

385
00:16:52,777 --> 00:16:56,093
I don't know. I...
I don't know... what I'm doing.

386
00:16:56,107 --> 00:16:59,450
Oh, pumpkin beer--
that was a good one.

387
00:16:59,487 --> 00:17:02,862
I'm just... I'm gonna go.
I... I'm so sorry.

388
00:17:02,877 --> 00:17:05,901
En-Enjoy the rest of your date.

389
00:17:10,467 --> 00:17:12,881
She seems nice.

390
00:17:24,205 --> 00:17:27,391
- Lilly, what the hell...
- I'm sorry.

391
00:17:27,405 --> 00:17:29,543
I only snuck up
there because...

392
00:17:29,557 --> 00:17:32,282
when  I saw how cute she was yesterday,
I freaked out.

393
00:17:32,296 --> 00:17:34,643
Lily, you saw her yesterday?

394
00:17:34,825 --> 00:17:38,873
Yeah, I...
kind of chased her down the street.

395
00:17:41,887 --> 00:17:45,232
Wait, so you were the
hunchback with the limp?

396
00:17:45,246 --> 00:17:46,771
Yeah.

397
00:17:46,788 --> 00:17:50,182
And she didn't break the picture,
I did.

398
00:17:52,577 --> 00:17:55,621
So Chloe's not crazy, she's...

399
00:17:55,948 --> 00:17:59,290
just a nice, normal girl.

400
00:17:59,606 --> 00:18:02,173
Yeah, she is.

401
00:18:02,937 --> 00:18:06,381
And you deserve a nice,
normal girl.

402
00:18:07,007 --> 00:18:09,573
So, why don't you
just go back up there

403
00:18:09,586 --> 00:18:12,233
and-and finish your date.

404
00:18:13,956 --> 00:18:15,793
Yeah.

405
00:18:16,127 --> 00:18:17,253
Okay.

406
00:18:17,355 --> 00:18:19,163
Okay.

407
00:18:21,516 --> 00:18:25,063
Wait, if you were the hunchback,
then why did she think you were a guy?

408
00:18:26,498 --> 00:18:30,793
I-I might have used a voice
that sounded like this.

409
00:18:31,398 --> 00:18:32,871
- Why?
- Because I didn't want

410
00:18:32,887 --> 00:18:36,073
her to know it was me, which 
I now realize doesn't make sense,

411
00:18:36,088 --> 00:18:38,641
because she hadn't even met me.

412
00:18:38,856 --> 00:18:40,971
You're crazy.

413
00:18:42,525 --> 00:18:48,872
You have... crazier eyes than
anybody that I have ever met.

414
00:18:50,365 --> 00:18:51,921
Shouldn't you be
going back up...

415
00:18:51,937 --> 00:18:53,960
I mean,
you're out of your mind.

416
00:18:53,976 --> 00:18:58,203
You're... just
absolutely insane.

417
00:19:00,656 --> 00:19:04,533
Shouldn't you be
going back upstairs?

418
00:19:07,896 --> 00:19:10,650
I've missed you so much.

419
00:19:17,617 --> 00:19:19,791
Okay, I ran it by the group,

420
00:19:19,805 --> 00:19:21,220
and we decided we're
gonna give you a choice.

421
00:19:21,256 --> 00:19:23,771
We will agree to stop
calling you Swarley,

422
00:19:23,785 --> 00:19:27,292
but instead,
we'll call you Jennifer.

423
00:19:28,886 --> 00:19:30,403
Well?

424
00:19:30,416 --> 00:19:32,221
I'm thinking.

425
00:19:33,336 --> 00:19:36,632
How about this?
On Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays...

426
00:19:36,647 --> 00:19:38,361
Hey.

427
00:19:38,375 --> 00:19:39,991
Look at this.

428
00:19:40,007 --> 00:19:41,933
So right there,
in the exact same place

429
00:19:41,946 --> 00:19:45,110
that six months earlier I had
walked up and found Marshall alone,

430
00:19:45,128 --> 00:19:48,860
crying over his breakup with Lily,
I found him again.

431
00:19:48,875 --> 00:19:51,192
Only this time he wasn't alone,

432
00:19:51,207 --> 00:19:53,030
and he was happy.

433
00:19:53,045 --> 00:19:56,281
So we went to the bar to celebrate,
and it was great.

434
00:19:56,296 --> 00:19:59,160
I was with Robin,
Marshall and Lily were back together,

435
00:19:59,176 --> 00:20:01,103
and Barney had a cool new name.

436
00:20:01,116 --> 00:20:03,472
All was right with the world...

437
00:20:03,485 --> 00:20:05,611
until we got back
to the apartment.

438
00:20:05,627 --> 00:20:07,750
Oh, my God.

439
00:20:08,038 --> 00:20:09,772
Hey, Chloe, I...

440
00:20:09,787 --> 00:20:11,711
guess I forgot I
left you up here.

441
00:20:11,727 --> 00:20:15,411
I was gonna leave,
but I can't find my keys.

442
00:20:16,505 --> 00:20:19,393
They're right there
on the coffee table.

443
00:20:21,108 --> 00:20:22,812
Silly me.

444
00:20:22,827 --> 00:20:25,800
I must have looked
everywhere else.

445
00:20:28,668 --> 00:20:31,820
Well... I'm just gonna go.

446
00:20:32,396 --> 00:20:34,872
Oh, I don't think we've met.
I'm Chloe.

447
00:20:34,888 --> 00:20:35,880
Robin.

448
00:20:35,897 --> 00:20:38,222
It's nice to meet you, Roland.

449
00:20:38,368 --> 00:20:40,440
I'll see you guys later.

450
00:20:43,178 --> 00:20:45,091
Roland?

451
00:20:45,806 --> 00:20:48,102
Your name's Roland.

452
00:20:48,628 --> 00:20:51,100
That's funny, right?

453
00:20:51,117 --> 00:20:53,382
Rock and Roland.

454
00:20:53,396 --> 00:20:57,112
Warsaw is the capital
of what? Roland.

455
00:20:57,548 --> 00:21:00,401
You're Monica Roland-ski.

456
00:21:01,696 --> 00:21:06,122
Hey, yeah,
that's just how I Roland.

457
00:21:06,425 --> 00:21:08,392
- Nice try, Swarley.
- Damn it.

458
00:21:16,837 --> 00:21:19,742
Swarley!

459
00:21:19,786 --> 00:21:22,062
# Sometimes you want to go #

460
00:21:22,076 --> 00:21:26,822
# Where everybody #
# knows your name #

461
00:21:27,136 --> 00:21:30,013
# And they're always #
# glad you came... #
