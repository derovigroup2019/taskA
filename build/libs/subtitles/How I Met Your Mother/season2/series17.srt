1
00:00:02,369 --> 00:00:04,436
This is awesome.

2
00:00:04,438 --> 00:00:06,839
I can't believe this
moment's finally here.

3
00:00:06,841 --> 00:00:10,175
One more mile and my
little boy turns 200,000.

4
00:00:10,177 --> 00:00:13,679
Your baby fiero's grown
into a really old man fiero.

5
00:00:13,681 --> 00:00:16,882
And just like an old man,
leaks fluid, smells stale,

6
00:00:16,884 --> 00:00:18,183
Makes weird noises out the back.

7
00:00:18,185 --> 00:00:19,985
(laughing):
Yeah, he does.

8
00:00:19,987 --> 00:00:21,987
Hey, light up those cigars
in the glove compartment.

9
00:00:21,989 --> 00:00:23,655
They're real cubans.

10
00:00:23,657 --> 00:00:25,791
I got 'em in chinatown
last year just for this moment.

11
00:00:25,793 --> 00:00:29,028
Uh, marshall, I'm not saying
you were definitely ripped off,

12
00:00:29,030 --> 00:00:32,564
But, um, these are chopsticks
wrapped in napkins.

13
00:00:32,566 --> 00:00:33,699
What are you talking about?
Whoa,

14
00:00:33,701 --> 00:00:34,833
Pothole.
What? No.

15
00:00:34,835 --> 00:00:36,735
(rumbling)
whoa. No.

16
00:00:36,737 --> 00:00:38,037
No, no,
n-n-n-no.

17
00:00:38,039 --> 00:00:39,671
No, there's only
.8 miles to go.

18
00:00:39,673 --> 00:00:40,539
Come on, buddy.

19
00:00:40,541 --> 00:00:41,974
Buddy!

20
00:00:41,976 --> 00:00:45,110
(engine stops running)

21
00:00:47,013 --> 00:00:49,281
Is it cool
if I still light these?

22
00:01:06,699 --> 00:01:09,168
Ted:
<i>Kids, sometimes life forces us</i>

23
00:01:09,170 --> 00:01:10,869
<i>To be someone
we didn't want to be.</i>

24
00:01:10,871 --> 00:01:13,005
<i>When that happens,
we often try to hold on</i>

25
00:01:13,007 --> 00:01:15,441
<i>To a little piece
of who we were.</i>

26
00:01:15,443 --> 00:01:17,443
<i>Maybe a tattoo.</i>

27
00:01:17,445 --> 00:01:19,011
<i>Or a piece of jewelry.</i>

28
00:01:19,013 --> 00:01:20,412
<i>A tiny souvenir that reminds us,</i>

29
00:01:20,414 --> 00:01:22,948
<i>"this is who I really am."</i>

30
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:25,117
<i>Marshall's souvenir
was not so tiny,</i>

31
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:26,285
<i>But the more he found himself</i>

32
00:01:26,287 --> 00:01:27,953
<i>Being pushed
toward the corporate world</i>

33
00:01:27,955 --> 00:01:30,689
<i>And away from his dream
of saving the environment,</i>

34
00:01:30,691 --> 00:01:33,225
<i>The tighter he held on
to that fiero.</i>

35
00:01:33,227 --> 00:01:34,860
Hey.

36
00:01:34,862 --> 00:01:36,395
One good thing:
We're off the hook

37
00:01:36,397 --> 00:01:38,230
For the folding party today.
Hey.

38
00:01:38,232 --> 00:01:41,066
It's very important
to both lily and me

39
00:01:41,068 --> 00:01:43,135
That there be
a handmade origami crane

40
00:01:43,137 --> 00:01:44,069
In each of our wedding's...

41
00:01:44,071 --> 00:01:45,604
(laughing):
150...

42
00:01:45,606 --> 00:01:47,873
I couldn't even get
through it. Thank god.

43
00:01:47,875 --> 00:01:49,808
Hey, your car's going
to be fine.

44
00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:51,643
This is the best
auto shop around.

45
00:01:51,645 --> 00:01:53,412
Look at this certificate.

46
00:01:53,414 --> 00:01:57,716
One of the mechanics here
finished a 64-ounce steak.

47
00:01:58,819 --> 00:02:01,587
We felt bad
that you guys were missing

48
00:02:01,589 --> 00:02:03,755
The super-fun
origami folding party,

49
00:02:03,757 --> 00:02:05,891
So we suggested moving it here.

50
00:02:05,893 --> 00:02:07,793
We insisted.

51
00:02:07,795 --> 00:02:09,628
Terrific.
(mutters)

52
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:10,662
How's the fiero?

53
00:02:10,664 --> 00:02:12,598
She's still in triage.

54
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:13,600
She?

55
00:02:13,601 --> 00:02:15,300
I thought it was
your little boy.

56
00:02:15,302 --> 00:02:16,768
Oh, it goes back and forth.

57
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:18,637
It's sort of a tranny car.

58
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:22,174
How long have you had her...
Slash him?

59
00:02:22,176 --> 00:02:25,144
My brothers handed it down
to me when I was 16.

60
00:02:25,146 --> 00:02:26,478
Oh, how nice of them.

61
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,514
Not really.

62
00:02:28,516 --> 00:02:30,082
Congratulations.

63
00:02:30,084 --> 00:02:31,583
The fiero is yours.

64
00:02:31,585 --> 00:02:33,552
(laughs)

65
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:36,255
If you pass the final test.

66
00:02:36,257 --> 00:02:37,756
Come on!

67
00:02:37,758 --> 00:02:39,124
I already shaved my legs

68
00:02:39,126 --> 00:02:41,593
And swallowed five dollars
in quarters.

69
00:02:41,595 --> 00:02:43,829
Only $4.50 has come out.

70
00:02:44,864 --> 00:02:46,632
Just go to the
weinerburger drive-thru

71
00:02:46,634 --> 00:02:47,799
And get us 12 cups of coffee.

72
00:02:47,801 --> 00:02:49,701
That's it?

73
00:02:49,703 --> 00:02:50,636
Oh, yeah.

74
00:02:50,638 --> 00:02:52,771
But we get to decide
what you wear.

75
00:02:52,773 --> 00:02:55,307
Agreed.

76
00:02:55,309 --> 00:02:57,776
Totally agreed.

77
00:02:57,778 --> 00:03:01,480
? I would walk 500 miles...

78
00:03:01,482 --> 00:03:03,182
You're naked.

79
00:03:03,184 --> 00:03:05,884
I'm aware of that.

80
00:03:06,686 --> 00:03:08,787
? ...Who'd walk 5,000 miles

81
00:03:08,789 --> 00:03:10,222
You have 50 cents?

82
00:03:10,224 --> 00:03:12,357
? And fall down at your door

83
00:03:12,359 --> 00:03:14,459
No...

84
00:03:14,461 --> 00:03:16,228
Look, can I just have
my coffee, please?

85
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:18,664
Sorry, we're all out
of trays and lids.

86
00:03:18,666 --> 00:03:21,133
Two tall guys just came
through here a few minutes ago

87
00:03:21,135 --> 00:03:22,234
And bought 'em all.

88
00:03:22,236 --> 00:03:24,469
(shudders)

89
00:03:26,739 --> 00:03:28,473
(groaning):
Oh.

90
00:03:32,545 --> 00:03:34,012
(both yelling)

91
00:03:34,014 --> 00:03:37,382
(screaming)

92
00:03:37,384 --> 00:03:39,551
(both laughing)

93
00:03:39,553 --> 00:03:40,819
And that is the origin

94
00:03:40,821 --> 00:03:43,822
Of marshall's insane "no food
or drinks in the fiero",

95
00:03:43,824 --> 00:03:45,390
"Not even groceries" rule.

96
00:03:45,392 --> 00:03:47,526
It is not insane.
Barney.

97
00:03:47,528 --> 00:03:50,829
That's like the third one
in a row that you've screwed up.

98
00:03:50,831 --> 00:03:53,031
Well, I'm trying, but it's...
I... Look.

99
00:03:53,033 --> 00:03:55,200
You fold twice to the middle,
fold back and forth,

100
00:03:55,202 --> 00:03:57,769
Pull the ends out,
flip over, open the flaps,

101
00:03:57,771 --> 00:03:59,104
Fold the edges,
crease the front,

102
00:03:59,106 --> 00:04:00,672
Fold in half,
fold the wings down,

103
00:04:00,674 --> 00:04:03,175
Push in the bottom corners,
and fold the wings back out.

104
00:04:03,177 --> 00:04:06,245
Or would you like one of
my kindergartners to show you?

105
00:04:06,247 --> 00:04:07,846
Wait, wait, wait.

106
00:04:07,848 --> 00:04:09,615
Wait, I think I've got it.

107
00:04:09,617 --> 00:04:10,849
(grumbling)

108
00:04:10,851 --> 00:04:11,851
No.

109
00:04:11,852 --> 00:04:14,720
Forget it; the
paper's too expensive.

110
00:04:14,722 --> 00:04:15,587
You're out.

111
00:04:15,589 --> 00:04:17,990
Aw, nerts.

112
00:04:19,926 --> 00:04:21,627
The food rule <i>is insane.</i>

113
00:04:21,629 --> 00:04:23,295
We could have died
because of it.

114
00:04:23,297 --> 00:04:24,763
Remember the 100k fiasco?

115
00:04:24,765 --> 00:04:25,931
Ah, the fiero-asco.

116
00:04:25,933 --> 00:04:27,866
Dude, I told you
that doesn't work.

117
00:04:27,868 --> 00:04:29,568
It's the 100k fiasco.

118
00:04:29,570 --> 00:04:31,069
What's the 100k fiasco?

119
00:04:31,071 --> 00:04:32,304
The fiero-asco?

120
00:04:32,306 --> 00:04:34,273
It was just before winter break

121
00:04:34,275 --> 00:04:35,274
Our freshman year of college.

122
00:04:35,276 --> 00:04:36,241
Marshall and I were roommates,

123
00:04:36,243 --> 00:04:37,643
But we weren't
really good friends yet.

124
00:04:37,645 --> 00:04:39,978
I thought ted was a
little bit pretentious.

125
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:42,581
And marshall was a total slob.

126
00:04:42,583 --> 00:04:44,816
Hey.

127
00:04:44,818 --> 00:04:46,251
Um... I'm
driving

128
00:04:46,253 --> 00:04:47,619
My fiero back over break.

129
00:04:47,621 --> 00:04:50,322
I know we see enough
of each other as it is,

130
00:04:50,324 --> 00:04:53,125
But, uh, if you want a ride,
I could use the gas money.

131
00:04:53,127 --> 00:04:54,159
You live in ohio, right?

132
00:04:54,161 --> 00:04:55,594
I could swing through
and pick you up.

133
00:04:55,596 --> 00:04:59,631
All right, first of all,
my parents live in ohio.

134
00:04:59,633 --> 00:05:01,600
I live in the moment.

135
00:05:01,602 --> 00:05:03,001
Plus,

136
00:05:03,003 --> 00:05:05,137
Karen and I haven't seen
each other since thanksgiving.

137
00:05:05,139 --> 00:05:06,738
I mean, we're both
really invested

138
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:08,807
In making this
long-distance thing work, so...

139
00:05:08,809 --> 00:05:11,443
All right, well, call me
if you change your mind.

140
00:05:11,445 --> 00:05:13,745
My odometer's going to hit 100k.

141
00:05:13,747 --> 00:05:15,080
(laughing):
No.

142
00:05:15,082 --> 00:05:18,250
She'd be so bummed
if I left early.

143
00:05:18,252 --> 00:05:21,086
It was totally mutual.

144
00:05:21,088 --> 00:05:23,689
I mean, karen brought it up
first, but I...

145
00:05:23,691 --> 00:05:25,023
It was...
It was totally mutual.

146
00:05:25,025 --> 00:05:26,658
? When I wake up...

147
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:28,760
I hear you.

148
00:05:28,762 --> 00:05:30,462
So what's up with you and lily?
Anything serious?

149
00:05:30,464 --> 00:05:32,331
(scoffing):
Yeah.

150
00:05:32,333 --> 00:05:33,498
Dude, we're college freshmen.

151
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:34,933
I'm not going to get tied down

152
00:05:34,935 --> 00:05:36,601
By the first chick
I hook up with.

153
00:05:36,603 --> 00:05:40,772
I mean, lily's cool, but this bird
you'll never chain, you know?

154
00:05:40,774 --> 00:05:43,542
The next few hours of our drive
<i>were classic road trip.</i>

155
00:05:43,544 --> 00:05:46,645
? I would walk 500 miles

156
00:05:46,647 --> 00:05:48,347
? and I would walk...

157
00:05:48,349 --> 00:05:49,614
? ...Know I'm gonna be

158
00:05:49,616 --> 00:05:51,850
? I'm gonna be the man
who's walking... ?

159
00:05:51,852 --> 00:05:54,219
? Ia-da-la-da-la-
da-la-da-da... ?

160
00:05:54,221 --> 00:05:56,888
So... This song.

161
00:05:56,890 --> 00:05:59,291
Oh, it's the best
song in the world.

162
00:05:59,293 --> 00:06:01,853
It's the only song I like.

163
00:06:02,128 --> 00:06:03,328
Just kidding.

164
00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:06,031
Tape's been stuck in the
player for, like, two years.

165
00:06:06,033 --> 00:06:07,499
Better than nothing, though.

166
00:06:07,501 --> 00:06:10,202
Maybe.

167
00:06:10,204 --> 00:06:11,970
? Da-la-da, da-la-da
? da-la-da, da-la-da

168
00:06:11,972 --> 00:06:13,805
? da-la-da
? da-la-da

169
00:06:13,807 --> 00:06:16,742
? da-da-da-da-la-
da-la-da-la-da-la! ?

170
00:06:16,744 --> 00:06:19,177
(song starts over)

171
00:06:19,179 --> 00:06:24,416
I am so... Sick...
Of this song.

172
00:06:24,418 --> 00:06:26,051
Don't worry. It
comes around again.

173
00:06:26,053 --> 00:06:27,919
What do you mean?

174
00:06:27,921 --> 00:06:32,357
Both: ? just to be the man
who walks a thousand miles ?

175
00:06:32,359 --> 00:06:37,362
? And falls down
at your door... ?

176
00:06:37,364 --> 00:06:39,431
Ooh.

177
00:06:39,433 --> 00:06:40,599
Yeah, we totally
nailed the ending.

178
00:06:40,601 --> 00:06:42,901
Yeah, that was probably,
like, our best one.

179
00:06:42,903 --> 00:06:44,703
Hey, you want to play zitch dog?

180
00:06:44,705 --> 00:06:45,570
What?

181
00:06:45,572 --> 00:06:46,572
Uh, it's a car game.

182
00:06:46,573 --> 00:06:47,739
Every time you see a dog,

183
00:06:47,741 --> 00:06:49,574
You got to be the first one
to say, "zitch dog."

184
00:06:49,576 --> 00:06:50,842
Mm. Yeah, I'm pretty good, so...

185
00:06:50,844 --> 00:06:52,511
Zitch dog.
Uh...

186
00:06:52,513 --> 00:06:54,679
What? No, I didn't know
we had... We'd started,

187
00:06:54,681 --> 00:06:56,114
But, uh, okay, that's cool.

188
00:06:56,116 --> 00:06:58,016
You got the first point.

189
00:06:58,018 --> 00:06:59,718
Zitch dog.
Zitch dog.

190
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:01,686
Damn it!

191
00:07:01,688 --> 00:07:02,854
Are we still playing?

192
00:07:02,856 --> 00:07:04,356
'Cause I wasn't...
I wasn't really...

193
00:07:04,358 --> 00:07:05,791
12-nothing.

194
00:07:05,793 --> 00:07:08,360
(whispers):
Marshall.

195
00:07:08,362 --> 00:07:11,730
? Da-la-da, da-la-da,
da-la-da, da-la-da ?

196
00:07:11,732 --> 00:07:12,531
Marshall.

197
00:07:12,533 --> 00:07:14,099
Zitch dog, blue suburban.

198
00:07:14,101 --> 00:07:15,367
Damn it!

199
00:07:15,369 --> 00:07:16,802
18-nothing.

200
00:07:18,571 --> 00:07:19,971
Ted: <i>Then marshall, who was so
busy cheating at zitch dog,</i>

201
00:07:19,973 --> 00:07:21,306
<i>Got us totally lost.</i>

202
00:07:21,308 --> 00:07:22,941
Where the hell are we?!

203
00:07:22,943 --> 00:07:24,443
Marshall:
<i>Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.</i>

204
00:07:24,445 --> 00:07:25,944
<i>Hold on.</i>

205
00:07:25,946 --> 00:07:27,946
I think you skipped something.

206
00:07:27,948 --> 00:07:28,948
Really?

207
00:07:28,949 --> 00:07:30,682
Seems impossible.

208
00:07:31,417 --> 00:07:33,585
Hey, we got some time.

209
00:07:33,587 --> 00:07:35,554
What do you say we
get off the highway,

210
00:07:35,556 --> 00:07:38,290
Take the road less
traveled, you know?

211
00:07:38,292 --> 00:07:40,559
Robert frost.

212
00:07:40,561 --> 00:07:42,594
Doesn't seem like a smart idea.

213
00:07:42,596 --> 00:07:43,662
Too late.

214
00:07:43,664 --> 00:07:45,664
I'm taking this exit.

215
00:07:45,666 --> 00:07:49,734
Who's not fun enough now, karen?

216
00:07:51,137 --> 00:07:52,571
Marshall:
<i>Then we got lost.</i>

217
00:07:52,573 --> 00:07:54,606
Where the hell are we?!

218
00:07:54,608 --> 00:07:57,609
No, keep driving.
We're almost out of gas,

219
00:07:57,611 --> 00:07:59,578
And we might not even
be on a road anymore.

220
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:00,679
It's below zero out.

221
00:08:00,681 --> 00:08:02,914
If we pull over, we could be
snowed in for days.

222
00:08:02,916 --> 00:08:04,115
Plus, I only have, like,

223
00:08:04,117 --> 00:08:05,517
Six granola bars
and three bottles of water.

224
00:08:05,519 --> 00:08:07,285
Nah, I threw them out. What?!

225
00:08:07,287 --> 00:08:10,121
No food or drink in the fiero.

226
00:08:10,123 --> 00:08:13,358
No food or drink in the f...?

227
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,360
You haven't washed your sheets
since orientation!

228
00:08:15,362 --> 00:08:18,597
Ted: <i>Thus began the longest
night of our lives.</i>

229
00:08:22,101 --> 00:08:26,137
Pretty sure that my foot
is frozen s-solid.

230
00:08:26,139 --> 00:08:28,607
Marshall...

231
00:08:28,609 --> 00:08:29,608
There's a very real chance

232
00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:32,477
That we're gonna be
snowed in here for days.

233
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:35,614
If I die first, do whatever
you need to survive.

234
00:08:35,616 --> 00:08:37,315
Eat my flesh.

235
00:08:37,317 --> 00:08:39,885
Slice me open like
a tauntaun, whatever.

236
00:08:39,887 --> 00:08:42,120
Thanks, ted.

237
00:08:42,122 --> 00:08:44,789
You're a good friend.

238
00:08:44,791 --> 00:08:48,026
And if I die first, you
just leave my body alone.

239
00:08:48,028 --> 00:08:49,361
What?

240
00:08:49,363 --> 00:08:51,830
I just said you could
cut me open and crawl inside me.

241
00:08:51,832 --> 00:08:54,165
Yeah, don't do any of that stuff
to me; it skeeves me out.

242
00:08:54,167 --> 00:08:56,668
But... But you're dead,
and I'm gonna die if I don't.

243
00:08:56,670 --> 00:09:00,238
Wasn't an easy decision.

244
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:04,042
This is all because
of your insane no-food rule.

245
00:09:04,044 --> 00:09:05,577
It's perfectly rational.

246
00:09:05,579 --> 00:09:06,511
(grunts)

247
00:09:06,513 --> 00:09:08,747
(both grunting)

248
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:10,582
Hey!
(glass shatters)

249
00:09:10,584 --> 00:09:13,385
My spectacles!

250
00:09:17,757 --> 00:09:20,091
Hey.

251
00:09:20,093 --> 00:09:22,661
I know we're low on gas,

252
00:09:22,663 --> 00:09:25,897
But can we turn on the heat
for just a minute?

253
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:30,335
Okay.

254
00:09:30,337 --> 00:09:34,406
? Da-la-da, da-la-da,
da-la-da, da-la-da ?

255
00:09:34,408 --> 00:09:36,608
? Ia-da-la-da-la-
da-la-da-da... ?

256
00:09:36,610 --> 00:09:37,676
(music stops)

257
00:09:37,678 --> 00:09:39,277
(wind howling loudly)

258
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:40,345
Dude...

259
00:09:40,347 --> 00:09:42,907
I hate to say this...

260
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:46,551
But it's so cold...

261
00:09:46,553 --> 00:09:47,752
There's only one way

262
00:09:47,754 --> 00:09:50,314
That we're gonna make it
through this night.

263
00:09:56,062 --> 00:09:57,395
We should've kept driving.

264
00:09:57,397 --> 00:09:58,697
Come on, marshall.

265
00:09:58,699 --> 00:10:00,365
No. No.

266
00:10:00,367 --> 00:10:02,534
We might die now.

267
00:10:02,536 --> 00:10:05,036
I may never see lily again.

268
00:10:05,038 --> 00:10:08,640
I never told
anybody this, but...

269
00:10:08,642 --> 00:10:12,043
I've known for a long time
that I'm gonna marry that girl.

270
00:10:12,045 --> 00:10:15,680
If we survive this,
someday I'm gonna marry her.

271
00:10:17,483 --> 00:10:20,919
I'm sorry about your spectacles.

272
00:10:20,921 --> 00:10:22,988
That's okay.

273
00:10:22,990 --> 00:10:25,123
They were decorative.

274
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:28,326
(moans)

275
00:10:30,096 --> 00:10:32,097
Hey, marshall.

276
00:10:32,099 --> 00:10:34,132
Yeah?

277
00:10:34,134 --> 00:10:36,635
Are you still
thinking about lily?

278
00:10:36,637 --> 00:10:38,603
Yeah.

279
00:10:38,605 --> 00:10:40,839
Please stop.

280
00:10:43,175 --> 00:10:44,743
Ted:
<i>And so marshall and I thought</i>

281
00:10:44,745 --> 00:10:47,112
<i>We were gonna die out there
in the middle of nowhere.</i>

282
00:10:47,114 --> 00:10:49,414
<i>But...</i> (chuckles)
<i>funny thing...</i>

283
00:10:57,356 --> 00:10:58,757
Hey.

284
00:10:58,759 --> 00:11:01,126
You lovers better
just keep on driving.

285
00:11:01,128 --> 00:11:02,360
(barking)

286
00:11:02,362 --> 00:11:03,528
(marshall and ted screaming)

287
00:11:03,530 --> 00:11:04,596
Zitch dog!

288
00:11:04,598 --> 00:11:05,598
Damn it!

289
00:11:05,599 --> 00:11:07,432
(both screaming)

290
00:11:07,434 --> 00:11:10,602
You said you were gonna
marry me that long ago?

291
00:11:10,604 --> 00:11:11,670
That is so sweet.

292
00:11:11,672 --> 00:11:12,804
That trip is when

293
00:11:12,806 --> 00:11:14,706
Marshall and I became
best friends.

294
00:11:14,708 --> 00:11:17,776
With privileges,
from the sound of it.

295
00:11:18,778 --> 00:11:19,978
Eriksen.

296
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:22,580
(machinery humming)

297
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:38,096
(suspenseful music plays)

298
00:11:41,467 --> 00:11:43,134
Wow.

299
00:11:43,136 --> 00:11:45,403
Looks like he really
needs a hug.

300
00:11:45,405 --> 00:11:47,639
Ted.

301
00:11:52,011 --> 00:11:54,412
(machinery humming)

302
00:11:54,414 --> 00:11:56,047
(clears throat)

303
00:11:56,049 --> 00:11:59,050
He said, uh, it would be
at least 3,000 bucks

304
00:11:59,052 --> 00:12:00,985
To make it run again.

305
00:12:00,987 --> 00:12:03,221
And even then,
there's no guarantee.

306
00:12:03,223 --> 00:12:04,889
Well, it's a pretty old car.

307
00:12:04,891 --> 00:12:07,726
I mean, you can keep
prolonging its life,

308
00:12:07,728 --> 00:12:10,729
But it's really mostly
machine at this point.

309
00:12:11,997 --> 00:12:13,898
I know that it's a lot of money,

310
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:15,233
But it's my fiero.

311
00:12:15,235 --> 00:12:16,868
You know?

312
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:20,939
I'm about to graduate and take
some sellout corporate law job,

313
00:12:20,941 --> 00:12:23,441
And without that fiero,
I'm just another guy in a suit.

314
00:12:23,443 --> 00:12:24,342
How dare you...

315
00:12:24,344 --> 00:12:26,344
Hey.

316
00:12:26,346 --> 00:12:28,913
I've been through
so much in that car.

317
00:12:28,915 --> 00:12:30,882
The suicidal cat.

318
00:12:30,884 --> 00:12:32,183
(cat shrieking)

319
00:12:32,185 --> 00:12:33,718
(loud bang)

320
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:35,453
Hitchhiking waldo.

321
00:12:39,558 --> 00:12:40,592
The homeless guy

322
00:12:40,594 --> 00:12:42,026
Who broke in through the window

323
00:12:42,028 --> 00:12:43,728
And threw up all over
the backseat.

324
00:12:43,730 --> 00:12:45,430
(coughing) lily, don't.

325
00:12:45,432 --> 00:12:47,432
Be strong. Do not go all
"prisoner's dilemma" on me.

326
00:12:47,434 --> 00:12:49,067
The car's on
its deathbed, robin.

327
00:12:49,069 --> 00:12:50,401
I have to clear my conscience.

328
00:12:50,403 --> 00:12:52,737
Guys, what are you
talking about?

329
00:12:52,739 --> 00:12:53,872
Okay.

330
00:12:53,874 --> 00:12:56,074
Shortly after we met robin,

331
00:12:56,076 --> 00:12:59,310
She and I were jonesing for
thai food from this one place.

332
00:12:59,312 --> 00:13:01,112
An hour and a half delivery.

333
00:13:01,114 --> 00:13:02,247
We can't wait that long.

334
00:13:02,249 --> 00:13:03,748
I wish we could take the fiero,

335
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:06,718
But marshall has
this insane no-food rule.

336
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,286
But thai food, lily.

337
00:13:08,288 --> 00:13:10,221
Pad yum mao.

338
00:13:10,223 --> 00:13:11,990
Tom kai gah.

339
00:13:11,992 --> 00:13:13,658
Thai see ran.

340
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:15,593
Oh! You're just saying
random syllables,

341
00:13:15,595 --> 00:13:17,061
And it still sounds delicious.

342
00:13:17,063 --> 00:13:18,429
Okay.

343
00:13:18,431 --> 00:13:19,731
Here's what we'll do.

344
00:13:19,733 --> 00:13:21,566
We'll drive over, pick it up,

345
00:13:21,568 --> 00:13:26,638
Very carefully drive it
back here with the windows open,

346
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:28,807
And he'll never know.

347
00:13:28,809 --> 00:13:30,675
Wow, these brakes
are really sensitive.

348
00:13:30,677 --> 00:13:33,244
Oh, marshall is gonna kill me!

349
00:13:33,246 --> 00:13:35,914
This and the difference between
"affect" and "effect"

350
00:13:35,916 --> 00:13:38,149
Are, like, the only two things
he's really serious about.

351
00:13:38,151 --> 00:13:39,851
Lily, it's gonna be fine.

352
00:13:39,853 --> 00:13:41,085
No, it's not.
Marshall's gonna freak.

353
00:13:41,087 --> 00:13:42,120
Oh, god, oh, god.

354
00:13:42,122 --> 00:13:43,621
What are we gonna do?
Oh, god, oh...!

355
00:13:43,623 --> 00:13:45,190
Shut up! Now,
listen to me.

356
00:13:45,192 --> 00:13:46,858
The clock is ticking.

357
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:47,992
Okay, first thing, we scoop up

358
00:13:47,994 --> 00:13:49,861
All these little pieces
of tofu and cabbage.

359
00:13:49,863 --> 00:13:51,529
Next, what we need
to take care of

360
00:13:51,531 --> 00:13:53,498
Are the really messy parts...
The pools that have collected.

361
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:55,667
We got to soak that soup up.

362
00:13:55,669 --> 00:13:57,802
Last is the smell.
We got to cover up

363
00:13:57,804 --> 00:14:01,339
There's two in the glove
compartment, but he's been

364
00:14:01,341 --> 00:14:03,581
Saving them. Hand me
those chopsticks.

365
00:14:06,512 --> 00:14:07,712
Mmm.

366
00:14:07,714 --> 00:14:09,614
Hey, how about some tunes?

367
00:14:09,616 --> 00:14:12,116
? ...Walk 500 miles

368
00:14:12,118 --> 00:14:13,518
Oh, great song.

369
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:16,654
? And I would walk 500 more

370
00:14:16,656 --> 00:14:19,057
These cigars aren't helping at all.
Yeah.

371
00:14:19,059 --> 00:14:21,359
This was a terrible idea.

372
00:14:21,361 --> 00:14:22,894
Mmm.

373
00:14:22,896 --> 00:14:26,736
Now it just smells like a
homeless guy threw up in here.

374
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:30,501
The broken windows?

375
00:14:30,503 --> 00:14:32,537
We had to make it
look realistic.

376
00:14:32,539 --> 00:14:34,005
Well, why did you break
two of them?

377
00:14:34,007 --> 00:14:36,574
Uh, it looked like
fun when she did it.

378
00:14:36,576 --> 00:14:38,476
So I wanted to try.

379
00:14:38,478 --> 00:14:41,145
Can't believe this whole time
it was you guys.

380
00:14:41,147 --> 00:14:43,882
I've been blaming really tanned
dancing leotard guy.

381
00:14:43,884 --> 00:14:46,918
Marshall, I'm so sorry,
but sharing that secret...

382
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:49,520
That's when robin and I
became best friends.

383
00:14:49,522 --> 00:14:51,256
Wow.

384
00:14:51,258 --> 00:14:52,490
What a special car.

385
00:14:52,492 --> 00:14:54,559
So, can I crush it
into a little cube yet?

386
00:14:54,561 --> 00:14:55,827
I don't know.

387
00:14:55,829 --> 00:14:56,728
I don't know. I don't know.

388
00:14:56,730 --> 00:14:58,863
Barney:
Come on, marshall.

389
00:14:58,865 --> 00:15:00,064
This is your fiero.

390
00:15:00,066 --> 00:15:01,666
You know the right thing
to do here.

391
00:15:01,668 --> 00:15:04,502
Wow, barney, why do you
love that car so much?

392
00:15:04,504 --> 00:15:06,938
Love it?

393
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:08,673
Hold on a second.

394
00:15:08,675 --> 00:15:09,941
Love it?

395
00:15:09,943 --> 00:15:12,110
I hate it!

396
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:14,779
What? Why?

397
00:15:14,781 --> 00:15:16,047
Why?

398
00:15:16,049 --> 00:15:17,548
Why?

399
00:15:17,550 --> 00:15:19,450
Why?!

400
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:22,220
Why?!

401
00:15:22,222 --> 00:15:23,222
Let me tell it.

402
00:15:23,223 --> 00:15:25,790
It was last year
during the transit strike.

403
00:15:25,792 --> 00:15:27,592
Hey.
Hey.

404
00:15:27,594 --> 00:15:28,594
Uh, is marshall around?

405
00:15:28,595 --> 00:15:30,561
I have a massage in queens
in half an hour.

406
00:15:30,563 --> 00:15:31,763
I need a ride.

407
00:15:31,765 --> 00:15:33,364
Uh, no, he's at the library
all day.

408
00:15:33,366 --> 00:15:34,232
Just take the keys.

409
00:15:34,234 --> 00:15:36,601
Uh... Hey!

410
00:15:36,603 --> 00:15:37,802
Why don't you drive me?

411
00:15:37,804 --> 00:15:39,404
It'll be like a total road trip.

412
00:15:39,406 --> 00:15:40,605
To queens?

413
00:15:40,607 --> 00:15:43,775
Yeah, we'll get,
we'll get beef jerky, triscuits.

414
00:15:43,777 --> 00:15:46,811
Uh, actually I have a lot
of work to do, so...

415
00:15:46,813 --> 00:15:47,912
Okay.

416
00:15:47,914 --> 00:15:50,048
Well, anyway, I'll cancel.

417
00:15:50,050 --> 00:15:51,215
See you later.
Wait!

418
00:15:53,052 --> 00:15:55,253
You know how to drive, right?

419
00:15:55,255 --> 00:15:57,488
What...? Of course I know
how to drive.

420
00:15:57,490 --> 00:15:58,656
I love driving.
Mm-hmm.

421
00:15:58,658 --> 00:16:00,591
Hitting the road.

422
00:16:00,593 --> 00:16:03,661
Cruising the lanes.

423
00:16:03,663 --> 00:16:05,129
And braking.

424
00:16:05,131 --> 00:16:07,198
Honking. Love it.

425
00:16:07,833 --> 00:16:09,400
Except for lady drivers.

426
00:16:09,402 --> 00:16:12,770
(chuckling): Don't get me
started on lady drivers.

427
00:16:12,772 --> 00:16:14,472
Which pedal's the gas?
Trick question.

428
00:16:14,474 --> 00:16:15,474
No, it's not.
Yes, it is.

429
00:16:15,475 --> 00:16:17,909
No, it's not.
Middle, left, right?

430
00:16:18,844 --> 00:16:20,645
I never learned how to drive!

431
00:16:20,647 --> 00:16:22,513
I grew up in the city.

432
00:16:22,515 --> 00:16:23,982
I never had a chance.

433
00:16:23,984 --> 00:16:25,817
Well, guess what?
You're getting your chance.

434
00:16:25,819 --> 00:16:27,085
Because I'm going to teach you.

435
00:16:27,087 --> 00:16:29,320
Barney stinson, buckle up.

436
00:16:29,322 --> 00:16:30,788
(sighs)

437
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:32,123
(sighs)

438
00:16:32,125 --> 00:16:33,157
This isn't right.

439
00:16:33,159 --> 00:16:34,792
God never meant for us to travel

440
00:16:34,794 --> 00:16:35,860
At such breakneck speeds.

441
00:16:35,862 --> 00:16:37,695
Relax.

442
00:16:37,697 --> 00:16:38,863
You're doing great.

443
00:16:38,865 --> 00:16:41,866
Ignore the old lady on the
rascal; this isn't a race.

444
00:16:41,868 --> 00:16:43,768
D-oh.

445
00:16:43,770 --> 00:16:45,436
Dude, a dog.

446
00:16:45,438 --> 00:16:46,871
Zitch dog. Yes!

447
00:16:46,873 --> 00:16:47,839
One-nothing.
Ah.

448
00:16:47,841 --> 00:16:49,207
What do I do?

449
00:16:49,209 --> 00:16:50,341
Tell me what to do, ted.

450
00:16:50,343 --> 00:16:51,676
Step on the brake.

451
00:16:51,678 --> 00:16:53,277
Sometime in the next 20 minutes.
Which?

452
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:54,312
Which one's the brake again?

453
00:16:54,314 --> 00:16:56,214
The left one.
Left. Left, oh, man, left.

454
00:16:56,216 --> 00:16:57,315
I'm totally blanking.

455
00:16:57,317 --> 00:16:58,883
Make the ls with your hands.

456
00:16:58,885 --> 00:17:00,718
Oh, we're not going to make it.

457
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,720
? I would walk 500 miles
(screams)

458
00:17:02,722 --> 00:17:04,188
Why did you just turn
on the radio?

459
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:05,957
I don't know why I
turned on the radio!

460
00:17:05,959 --> 00:17:07,692
We're going to die.
Tell me what to do, ted.

461
00:17:07,694 --> 00:17:08,659
Relax. You're
being crazy.

462
00:17:08,661 --> 00:17:09,794
Help me, ted!

463
00:17:09,796 --> 00:17:11,796
Stop, drop and roll. I'm
being serious. Stop...

464
00:17:11,798 --> 00:17:14,899
(overlapping chatter)

465
00:17:14,901 --> 00:17:17,402
Screaming is fun!
Screaming is fun!

466
00:17:17,404 --> 00:17:18,903
(screaming)

467
00:17:19,705 --> 00:17:21,806
(yelling)

468
00:17:21,808 --> 00:17:23,975
(screaming)

469
00:17:23,977 --> 00:17:26,077
(sighs) (laughing)

470
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:27,079
Oh.

471
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:28,713
I can't move.

472
00:17:28,715 --> 00:17:31,716
I can't... I can't feel my...

473
00:17:31,718 --> 00:17:33,051
Wait.

474
00:17:33,986 --> 00:17:35,820
What?

475
00:17:38,757 --> 00:17:39,657
(sighs)

476
00:17:39,659 --> 00:17:41,392
We're okay.
Oh.

477
00:17:41,394 --> 00:17:43,394
We're okay.
We're okay.

478
00:17:43,396 --> 00:17:45,196
It's a miracle, ted!
Oh.

479
00:17:45,198 --> 00:17:46,497
Ah. Ah.

480
00:17:46,499 --> 00:17:48,199
Wow.

481
00:17:48,201 --> 00:17:50,501
Sounds like you had some
accident in that car.

482
00:17:50,503 --> 00:17:52,870
Actually, he had two accidents,
if you add the fact that he...

483
00:17:52,872 --> 00:17:54,605
Hummina-hummina-hummina-hummina.

484
00:17:56,608 --> 00:17:59,577
I shouldn't even be here,
thanks to that deathtrap.

485
00:17:59,579 --> 00:18:01,179
But fate...

486
00:18:01,181 --> 00:18:03,781
Fate gave me a second chance.

487
00:18:03,783 --> 00:18:05,183
And helped me realize

488
00:18:05,185 --> 00:18:07,585
That our days on this planet
are too few to squander.

489
00:18:07,587 --> 00:18:11,022
So I decided from that moment on

490
00:18:11,024 --> 00:18:15,226
To continue living life
to its fullest.

491
00:18:15,228 --> 00:18:17,695
So you made
a life-changing decision

492
00:18:17,697 --> 00:18:19,630
To not change your life at all.

493
00:18:19,632 --> 00:18:21,265
True story.

494
00:18:21,267 --> 00:18:22,867
Guys...

495
00:18:22,869 --> 00:18:25,770
This fiero's meant a lot
to all of us.

496
00:18:25,772 --> 00:18:27,772
Friendships were made.

497
00:18:27,774 --> 00:18:28,973
Adventures had.

498
00:18:28,975 --> 00:18:31,109
Horrors faced.

499
00:18:31,111 --> 00:18:33,811
That's why we have to get rid
of it.

500
00:18:33,813 --> 00:18:34,712
Yes!

501
00:18:34,714 --> 00:18:36,614
What?
What?

502
00:18:36,616 --> 00:18:38,649
It's lived a great life and it
deserves to die with dignity.

503
00:18:38,651 --> 00:18:40,751
But 200,000...
But

504
00:18:40,753 --> 00:18:42,787
That's life. You know?

505
00:18:42,789 --> 00:18:45,156
You never end up where you
thought you wanted to be.

506
00:18:45,158 --> 00:18:46,657
I'm not helping the environment.

507
00:18:46,659 --> 00:18:48,059
Ted's not a philosopher.

508
00:18:48,061 --> 00:18:48,893
Lily's not

509
00:18:48,895 --> 00:18:50,228
A world-famous artist.

510
00:18:50,230 --> 00:18:50,962
Barney's never driven

511
00:18:50,964 --> 00:18:52,730
More than ten miles an hour.

512
00:18:52,732 --> 00:18:56,667
I'm sure, has also experienced
disappointment in her life.

513
00:18:56,669 --> 00:18:57,835
Maybe?

514
00:18:57,837 --> 00:18:59,604
And my fiero's not a fiero

515
00:18:59,606 --> 00:19:01,539
That went 200,000 miles.

516
00:19:02,407 --> 00:19:03,641
It's okay.

517
00:19:03,643 --> 00:19:05,143
You know?

518
00:19:05,145 --> 00:19:07,445
Those are old dreams.

519
00:19:07,447 --> 00:19:09,447
We'll get a new car

520
00:19:09,449 --> 00:19:11,315
And we'll fill that one up
with new memories.

521
00:19:11,317 --> 00:19:13,518
And that'll be the car we had

522
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:14,852
When we were first married.

523
00:19:14,854 --> 00:19:15,820
When we owned

524
00:19:15,822 --> 00:19:17,355
Our first house.

525
00:19:17,357 --> 00:19:19,590
Maybe even the first car
our four kids remember.

526
00:19:19,592 --> 00:19:21,792
Oh, that's so sweet.

527
00:19:21,794 --> 00:19:24,829
The first car
our two kids remember.

528
00:19:26,632 --> 00:19:28,900
Um, I would like
to say good-bye.

529
00:19:30,702 --> 00:19:32,837
(machinery humming)

530
00:19:32,839 --> 00:19:35,106
(sighs)

531
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:39,510
(tape ejects)

532
00:19:39,512 --> 00:19:42,180
Oh.

533
00:19:43,849 --> 00:19:46,117
(sighs)

534
00:19:47,619 --> 00:19:48,819
You know what?

535
00:19:48,821 --> 00:19:50,821
This fiero, it's effected
all our lives.

536
00:19:50,823 --> 00:19:52,056
Affected.
That's what I said.

537
00:19:52,058 --> 00:19:53,724
Just making sure.

538
00:19:53,726 --> 00:19:55,193
Got us all a lot of places.

539
00:19:55,195 --> 00:19:57,795
I mean maybe it's time
we return the favor.

540
00:19:57,797 --> 00:19:59,697
This fiero should have
made it to 200,000.

541
00:19:59,699 --> 00:20:01,966
So, let's get it out that door.

542
00:20:01,968 --> 00:20:03,834
And we'll push it
the last .7 miles.

543
00:20:03,836 --> 00:20:04,836
It'd do

544
00:20:04,837 --> 00:20:06,571
The same for us.

545
00:20:10,842 --> 00:20:14,445
(triumphant
musical theme playing)

546
00:20:23,522 --> 00:20:25,223
(music stops) hey, geniuses.

547
00:20:25,225 --> 00:20:26,691
The back wheels are on blocks.

548
00:20:26,693 --> 00:20:28,159
That car ain't going anywhere.

549
00:20:30,362 --> 00:20:32,029
Close enough!

550
00:20:32,031 --> 00:20:33,598
All:
Close enough!

551
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:36,367
<i>And so marshall said good-bye
to his fiero.</i>

552
00:20:36,369 --> 00:20:38,836
<i>And as the car's final gift
to us all,</i>

553
00:20:38,838 --> 00:20:41,239
<i>The money he got for scrap
parts paid our bar tab</i>

554
00:20:41,241 --> 00:20:42,873
<i>For the next two nights.</i>

555
00:20:42,875 --> 00:20:44,909
<i>Arrivederci,</i> fiero!

556
00:20:44,911 --> 00:20:47,211
You were the freaking
giving tree of cars.

557
00:20:47,213 --> 00:20:49,046
Aw, may you rust in peace.

558
00:20:49,048 --> 00:20:51,716
Rot in hell, devil steed.

559
00:20:51,718 --> 00:20:52,917
(bottles clink)

560
00:20:52,919 --> 00:20:56,153
And what better friend is there
<i>than that?</i>

561
00:21:00,225 --> 00:21:02,026
Hey, man.
Bro.

562
00:21:02,028 --> 00:21:03,561
Have you heard this new song?

563
00:21:03,563 --> 00:21:04,629
I just got the cassingle.

564
00:21:04,631 --> 00:21:06,764
Put it in.

565
00:21:06,766 --> 00:21:10,234
? I would walk 500 miles...
Oh!

566
00:21:10,236 --> 00:21:12,303
I am never going to get sick
of this song.

567
00:21:12,305 --> 00:21:15,640
Never, ever, never, never, ever.

568
00:21:15,642 --> 00:21:17,241
Yeah!

569
00:21:17,243 --> 00:21:20,378
? ...A thousand miles to fall
down at your door... ?
