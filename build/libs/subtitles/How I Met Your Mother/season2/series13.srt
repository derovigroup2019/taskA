00:00:01,868 --> 00:00:04,770
Ted: <i>Some kids dream
of being astronauts.</i>

2
00:00:04,772 --> 00:00:07,006
<i>Some kids dream
of playing baseball.</i>

3
00:00:07,008 --> 00:00:09,274
<i>When I was a kid,
I had only one dream.</i>

4
00:00:09,276 --> 00:00:11,210
<i>To build a skyscraper.</i>

5
00:00:11,212 --> 00:00:13,112
That's stupid.

6
00:00:14,447 --> 00:00:16,548
<i>There were some obstacles
along the way.</i>

7
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:18,617
<i>But eventually
my dream came true.</i>

8
00:00:18,619 --> 00:00:21,687
<i>I became an architect.</i>

9
00:00:21,689 --> 00:00:22,955
Morning, everyone!

10
00:00:22,957 --> 00:00:27,860
So, I had an idea
for the atrium.

11
00:00:27,862 --> 00:00:29,061
Ready?

12
00:00:29,063 --> 00:00:30,763
Columns.

13
00:00:31,398 --> 00:00:33,799
That's stupid.

14
00:00:52,552 --> 00:00:54,686
I... I can't believe

15
00:00:54,688 --> 00:00:56,355
You knocked over my model.

16
00:00:56,357 --> 00:01:00,492
Well, it's just... It's not
exactly new is it... columns?

17
00:01:00,494 --> 00:01:03,529
I mean, what's your next
groundbreaking idea... ceilings?

18
00:01:03,531 --> 00:01:04,997
Floors?

19
00:01:04,999 --> 00:01:06,031
Windows?

20
00:01:06,033 --> 00:01:07,766
Ted:
<i>I know what you're thinking:</i>

21
00:01:07,768 --> 00:01:09,101
<i>Who's this jerk?</i>

22
00:01:09,103 --> 00:01:11,670
<i>Well, this jerk was
hammond druthers,</i>

23
00:01:11,672 --> 00:01:14,039
<i>A legend in the architecture
community.</i>

24
00:01:14,041 --> 00:01:16,842
<i>Very big in the '80s.</i>

25
00:01:16,844 --> 00:01:19,912
<i>He was also far and away
the worst boss I ever had.</i>

26
00:01:19,914 --> 00:01:23,048
<i>Then I designed the spokane
national bank building.</i>

27
00:01:23,050 --> 00:01:24,249
<i>And suddenly...</i>

28
00:01:24,251 --> 00:01:25,918
<i>I was his boss.</i>

29
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:27,719
<i>And he didn't like it.
Stairs?</i>

30
00:01:27,721 --> 00:01:31,190
And to be honest, I wasn't sure
<i>I liked it either.</i>

31
00:01:31,192 --> 00:01:34,593
<i>See, before, when I was just
another employee,</i>

32
00:01:34,595 --> 00:01:36,528
<i>I was happy, carefree.</i>

33
00:01:36,530 --> 00:01:38,530
<i>The guy who hung out
in the break room</i>

34
00:01:38,532 --> 00:01:39,765
<i>Making fun of the boss.</i>

35
00:01:39,767 --> 00:01:41,300
Did you see what
he was wearing today?

36
00:01:41,302 --> 00:01:43,402
It was like his pants were
being held up by his nipples.

37
00:01:43,404 --> 00:01:46,105
(all laugh)

38
00:01:46,107 --> 00:01:47,806
Yeah, and that shirt
with the flowers,

39
00:01:47,808 --> 00:01:49,274
I get hay fever just
looking at it.

40
00:01:49,276 --> 00:01:51,276
(all laugh)

41
00:01:51,278 --> 00:01:53,412
<i>But suddenly
I was a different guy.</i>

42
00:01:53,414 --> 00:01:54,813
(laughter)

43
00:01:54,815 --> 00:01:56,281
Hey, guys.

44
00:01:57,150 --> 00:01:58,317
What's so funny?

45
00:01:58,319 --> 00:02:00,085
Nothing.

46
00:02:00,087 --> 00:02:02,788
Um... Nice shirt.

47
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:04,256
Thanks.

48
00:02:04,258 --> 00:02:05,924
<i>The hours were insane.</i>

49
00:02:05,926 --> 00:02:09,394
<i>I was always working even
when I wasn't at work.</i>

50
00:02:09,396 --> 00:02:11,096
Oh, robin...

51
00:02:11,098 --> 00:02:12,798
I just had a great idea.

52
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:16,201
Oh, do whatever you want
to me just don't wake me up.

53
00:02:19,672 --> 00:02:21,974
<i>Before, I used to be this guy.</i>

54
00:02:21,976 --> 00:02:24,309
Dude, of course you
should take the day off

55
00:02:24,311 --> 00:02:25,644
For the foo fighters concert.

56
00:02:25,646 --> 00:02:26,411
Just say you're sick.

57
00:02:26,413 --> 00:02:27,746
<i>But now...</i>

58
00:02:27,748 --> 00:02:29,148
(coughing) <i>I was this guy.</i>

59
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:31,150
Sick, huh?

60
00:02:31,152 --> 00:02:33,218
Unbutton your shirt.

61
00:02:35,188 --> 00:02:38,524
Hmm... "foo fighters."

62
00:02:39,259 --> 00:02:41,193
Get back to work.

63
00:02:41,195 --> 00:02:44,129
<i>But still, the worst part
was druthers.</i>

64
00:02:44,131 --> 00:02:45,131
Well, I was thinking...

65
00:02:45,132 --> 00:02:46,098
Ceilings?

66
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:46,832
Oops.

67
00:02:46,834 --> 00:02:48,133
Said that already.

68
00:02:48,135 --> 00:02:51,803
Then again, you seem to like
rehashing old ideas.

69
00:02:51,805 --> 00:02:53,772
I'm kidding, of course.

70
00:02:53,774 --> 00:02:55,307
Another hole in one, boss.

71
00:02:55,309 --> 00:02:56,309
(clicks tongue)

72
00:02:57,343 --> 00:02:59,945
Oh, wow, he must be
really good-looking.

73
00:02:59,947 --> 00:03:01,213
Why would you say that?

74
00:03:01,215 --> 00:03:02,648
Well, 'cause only good-looking
people can get away

75
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:03,715
With saying things like that.

76
00:03:03,717 --> 00:03:05,617
I have found that to be true.

77
00:03:05,619 --> 00:03:07,539
It's a blessing
and a curse really.

78
00:03:08,221 --> 00:03:10,155
Ted, you can't let him
treat you like that.

79
00:03:10,157 --> 00:03:11,290
Yeah, you gotta ask yourself,

80
00:03:11,292 --> 00:03:12,191
Who's the boss?

81
00:03:12,193 --> 00:03:13,193
Tony.

82
00:03:13,194 --> 00:03:14,826
Angela.
Mona.

83
00:03:14,828 --> 00:03:15,694
Mona?

84
00:03:15,696 --> 00:03:16,862
Watch it more closely.

85
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:18,197
Rock your world.

86
00:03:18,998 --> 00:03:20,165
So, what are you gonna do?

87
00:03:20,167 --> 00:03:21,733
Well...

88
00:03:21,735 --> 00:03:23,802
It's awkward, I mean,
the guy used to be my boss.

89
00:03:23,804 --> 00:03:25,737
So, I went to talk
to the managing partner.

90
00:03:25,739 --> 00:03:26,972
Fire him.

91
00:03:26,974 --> 00:03:28,840
Well, sir, I was thinking

92
00:03:28,842 --> 00:03:30,475
He could just be put
on a different project.

93
00:03:30,477 --> 00:03:31,643
Fire him.

94
00:03:32,512 --> 00:03:33,745
He's an arrogant, washed-up,

95
00:03:33,747 --> 00:03:34,913
Pain in the ass.

96
00:03:34,915 --> 00:03:36,081
In fact,

97
00:03:36,083 --> 00:03:38,050
Fire everyone on that project.

98
00:03:38,052 --> 00:03:39,985
Druthers, mosby,

99
00:03:39,987 --> 00:03:41,353
The whole lot of them.

100
00:03:41,355 --> 00:03:42,754
Mosby, sir?

101
00:03:42,756 --> 00:03:44,856
I, I... I hear mosby's doing
some great work.

102
00:03:44,858 --> 00:03:46,692
Fine, mosby can stay.

103
00:03:46,694 --> 00:03:48,994
But tell him he's on thin ice.

104
00:03:51,497 --> 00:03:52,931
Come here.

105
00:03:55,335 --> 00:03:57,603
I like you, crosby.

106
00:03:58,838 --> 00:04:00,606
You mind if I charge my phone?

107
00:04:00,608 --> 00:04:01,740
Knock yourself out.

108
00:04:01,742 --> 00:04:04,376
Well, ted, if you
do fire druthers,

109
00:04:04,378 --> 00:04:05,577
The key is timing.

110
00:04:05,579 --> 00:04:08,080
Remember when I had to
fire my makeup artist?

111
00:04:08,082 --> 00:04:09,581
Vicki, um...

112
00:04:09,583 --> 00:04:11,850
I'm so sorry about this,

113
00:04:11,852 --> 00:04:14,786
But there's been some
budget cuts and, um,

114
00:04:14,788 --> 00:04:16,521
We have to let you go.

115
00:04:16,523 --> 00:04:19,024
I mean, after tonight.

116
00:04:19,026 --> 00:04:22,060
I still need my makeup
for the broadcast.

117
00:04:22,062 --> 00:04:23,695
So...

118
00:04:26,032 --> 00:04:29,468
Our thoughts and prayers go out
to the families of the victims.

119
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:30,869
You know what?
I'm gonna do it.

120
00:04:30,871 --> 00:04:32,638
I'm gonna fire druthers
tomorrow.

121
00:04:35,441 --> 00:04:38,477
Oh, my god!
What?

122
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:39,544
Do you know about this?

123
00:04:39,546 --> 00:04:41,713
No.
What is that?

124
00:04:41,715 --> 00:04:44,216
Only the greatest thing ever.

125
00:04:44,218 --> 00:04:47,619
Wait, wait, wait...
That's not enough buildup.

126
00:04:47,621 --> 00:04:50,155
If they were
to cure cancer tomorrow,

127
00:04:50,157 --> 00:04:52,624
This would still be the greatest
thing to happen all week.

128
00:04:52,626 --> 00:04:53,925
Okay.

129
00:04:53,927 --> 00:04:57,996
Now you're ready
for naked marshall.

130
00:04:57,998 --> 00:04:59,197
Oh, my god.

131
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,167
This is awesome times awesome.

132
00:05:02,169 --> 00:05:03,335
It's awesome squared.

133
00:05:03,337 --> 00:05:04,970
I know, right?

134
00:05:04,972 --> 00:05:06,638
Behind the piano this whole time.
Wait.

135
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:08,840
If marshall went to all
this trouble to hide it,

136
00:05:08,842 --> 00:05:10,609
He clearly doesn't
want us to find it.

137
00:05:10,611 --> 00:05:13,011
Oh, come on, robin.
No,

138
00:05:13,013 --> 00:05:15,573
I'm saying that he must be
really embarrassed by this.

139
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:18,684
We are gonna have so much fun.

140
00:05:18,686 --> 00:05:20,485
I know! We're gonna
have so much fun!

141
00:05:20,487 --> 00:05:23,155
Oh, sorry I'm late;
lunch ran a little long.

142
00:05:23,157 --> 00:05:24,623
You wanted to see me, mosby?

143
00:05:24,625 --> 00:05:26,591
Uh, yeah, like four hours ago.

144
00:05:26,593 --> 00:05:28,827
Well, excuse me,

145
00:05:28,829 --> 00:05:30,762
For spending the last four hours

146
00:05:30,764 --> 00:05:32,831
Drawing designs
for your building.

147
00:05:32,833 --> 00:05:35,367
This is a cocktail napkin.

148
00:05:35,369 --> 00:05:38,070
Covered in profanity.

149
00:05:39,172 --> 00:05:40,505
Look, hammond,

150
00:05:40,507 --> 00:05:43,208
Um, there's no easy
way to say this,

151
00:05:43,210 --> 00:05:44,676
So...

152
00:05:44,678 --> 00:05:46,345
Why don't we just, um,

153
00:05:46,347 --> 00:05:48,113
Step into your office.

154
00:05:48,948 --> 00:05:51,149
Group:
? happy birthday

155
00:05:51,151 --> 00:05:53,452
Oh... (laughing)
? to you

156
00:05:53,454 --> 00:05:56,154
? happy birthday to you
oh, you had me.

157
00:05:56,156 --> 00:05:57,823
You so had me.

158
00:05:57,825 --> 00:06:01,026
? Happy birthday,
dear hammond ?

159
00:06:01,028 --> 00:06:04,663
Oh! ? happy birthday to you ?

160
00:06:04,665 --> 00:06:05,831
Robin:
<i>So, you</i>

161
00:06:05,833 --> 00:06:06,833
Didn't fire him?

162
00:06:06,834 --> 00:06:09,468
I can't fire a guy
on his birthday.

163
00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:10,402
Everyone would hate me.

164
00:06:10,404 --> 00:06:12,337
Besides, they put a party hat
on me.

165
00:06:12,339 --> 00:06:13,772
My authority was compromised.

166
00:06:14,474 --> 00:06:16,141
Oh, hey, marshall.

167
00:06:16,143 --> 00:06:17,642
Have a seat.

168
00:06:18,811 --> 00:06:21,313
I know how much you love stools.

169
00:06:21,315 --> 00:06:23,014
Mm, thanks.

170
00:06:23,016 --> 00:06:24,549
Yeah, stools are better
for your posture.

171
00:06:24,551 --> 00:06:25,817
And, uh...

172
00:06:25,819 --> 00:06:29,187
I... Got you a rose.

173
00:06:29,189 --> 00:06:30,322
Thank you.

174
00:06:30,324 --> 00:06:31,523
That's so sweet.

175
00:06:31,525 --> 00:06:32,758
You guys are being...

176
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:34,259
(suddenly flat):
So sweet.

177
00:06:34,261 --> 00:06:35,360
Hey, guys.

178
00:06:35,362 --> 00:06:36,595
Guess what I got.

179
00:06:36,597 --> 00:06:37,829
A new dart.

180
00:06:37,831 --> 00:06:39,598
Oh, wow, a new dart. Ted: Oh.

181
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,366
Hey, that new dart is great.

182
00:06:41,368 --> 00:06:43,835
I did not know you were such
a fan of new dart, barney.

183
00:06:43,837 --> 00:06:46,037
Oh, yes, robin,
I just love new dart.

184
00:06:46,039 --> 00:06:48,206
Nude art.

185
00:06:48,208 --> 00:06:49,341
Nude art.
Nude art.

186
00:06:49,343 --> 00:06:51,243
(laughing)

187
00:06:51,245 --> 00:06:53,565
Okay, all right, so what, you
guys found the painting, huh?

188
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:55,680
I knew this day would come.

189
00:06:55,682 --> 00:06:56,782
How did you know that?

190
00:06:56,784 --> 00:06:59,618
Because I didn't hide it
very well.

191
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:02,287
Ted: <i>So the story on the painting
is that, back in college,</i>

192
00:07:02,289 --> 00:07:04,689
<i>Lily wanted to do a nude study
for her art class.</i>

193
00:07:04,691 --> 00:07:06,591
<i>Marshall wasn't so
into the idea.</i>

194
00:07:06,593 --> 00:07:07,626
Well, I just...

195
00:07:07,628 --> 00:07:08,927
Don't think that some dude

196
00:07:08,929 --> 00:07:11,630
Should drop trou just
to pose for you.

197
00:07:11,632 --> 00:07:13,465
It's for class,

198
00:07:13,467 --> 00:07:16,134
And it's just that weird kid
hunter from my freshman hall.

199
00:07:16,136 --> 00:07:17,869
The frisbee dude
with the soul patch?

200
00:07:17,871 --> 00:07:19,771
He's like the hottest guy
in school!

201
00:07:19,773 --> 00:07:21,373
No, he's actually a
little husky... Oh,

202
00:07:21,375 --> 00:07:22,641
He's just huggable!

203
00:07:22,643 --> 00:07:24,409
And complicated...

204
00:07:24,411 --> 00:07:26,211
And a little bit of a jerk.

205
00:07:26,213 --> 00:07:28,780
Just enough so you think
maybe you can change him.

206
00:07:28,782 --> 00:07:30,949
Okay, just forget it.

207
00:07:32,618 --> 00:07:35,153
Call me old-fashioned,

208
00:07:35,155 --> 00:07:38,390
I just think that I'm the only
guy you should see naked.

209
00:07:38,392 --> 00:07:40,625
Well, then you'll have to do it.

210
00:07:40,627 --> 00:07:42,761
Are you kidding me?

211
00:07:42,763 --> 00:07:44,629
What if somebody sees it?

212
00:07:44,631 --> 00:07:46,765
We're not in high school
anymore.

213
00:07:46,767 --> 00:07:50,068
People don't make fun of you
for posing nude for a painting.

214
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:52,571
We're adults now.

215
00:07:52,573 --> 00:07:53,905
We totally saw your butt.

216
00:07:53,907 --> 00:07:55,740
(both laughing)

217
00:07:55,742 --> 00:07:57,142
(mocking laugh)

218
00:07:58,311 --> 00:08:00,612
This painting has caused
too much grief already.

219
00:08:00,614 --> 00:08:03,148
I'm destroying it right now.

220
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:05,283
(mockingly): Oh, no, what's
the matter, marshall?

221
00:08:05,285 --> 00:08:06,451
Where is it?

222
00:08:06,453 --> 00:08:08,153
I'll tell you where it is

223
00:08:08,155 --> 00:08:09,955
If you'll answer
these riddles three.

224
00:08:09,957 --> 00:08:11,490
You hung it up in the bar,
didn't you?

225
00:08:11,492 --> 00:08:13,258
Yo, why you gotta
ruin my riddles?

226
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:15,126
Oh...!

227
00:08:15,128 --> 00:08:16,361
Field trip!

228
00:08:16,363 --> 00:08:18,029
(giddy laugh)

229
00:08:19,265 --> 00:08:20,365
(screams)

230
00:08:20,367 --> 00:08:22,000
Barney:
Oh, no.

231
00:08:22,002 --> 00:08:24,135
Someone put your painting
up behind the bar.

232
00:08:24,137 --> 00:08:25,770
Classic!

233
00:08:25,772 --> 00:08:27,205
What a memorable prank.

234
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:29,941
Hey, marshall.

235
00:08:29,943 --> 00:08:30,976
What'll you have?

236
00:08:30,978 --> 00:08:32,477
What'll I have?

237
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:34,479
Um, I don't know, maybe a beer

238
00:08:34,481 --> 00:08:36,982
And that nude painting of me
hanging behind the bar!

239
00:08:36,984 --> 00:08:38,950
Ooh, I'm sorry, that painting's
property of the bar.

240
00:08:38,952 --> 00:08:40,318
I know that barney gave you
that painting.

241
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,720
I don't know
what you're talking about.

242
00:08:41,722 --> 00:08:42,954
Whatever he's paying you,
I'll pay you double.

243
00:08:42,956 --> 00:08:43,722
I doubt it.

244
00:08:43,724 --> 00:08:44,789
Whatever he's paying you,

245
00:08:44,791 --> 00:08:46,024
I'll give you that
plus ten bucks.

246
00:08:46,026 --> 00:08:46,858
I doubt it.

247
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:47,993
All right, you know what, carl,

248
00:08:47,995 --> 00:08:49,060
You just lost yourself
a regular customer.

249
00:08:49,062 --> 00:08:50,795
I doubt it.

250
00:08:54,667 --> 00:08:57,107
This painting is the worst thing
that's ever happened to me.

251
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:01,907
Okay, where should
we put it up next?

252
00:09:01,909 --> 00:09:03,141
In his law school?

253
00:09:03,143 --> 00:09:04,643
Ooh on the side of a bus.

254
00:09:04,645 --> 00:09:06,077
Oh, oh! How much
do billboards cost?

255
00:09:06,079 --> 00:09:08,747
Easy, scherbatsky.
Finesse.

256
00:09:08,749 --> 00:09:10,348
I've got a five-year
rollout plan.

257
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:11,983
I'll have you know
that painting's

258
00:09:11,985 --> 00:09:13,652
Got commitments
all over the city.

259
00:09:13,654 --> 00:09:15,020
Then, after new york...

260
00:09:15,022 --> 00:09:16,321
(screaming) I'm thinking.

261
00:09:16,323 --> 00:09:17,756
Heh-yah!

262
00:09:19,091 --> 00:09:20,825
Hey!

263
00:09:23,062 --> 00:09:24,896
One of my worst fears
has come true...

264
00:09:24,898 --> 00:09:26,998
I just saw marshall
grabbing himself naked.

265
00:09:28,234 --> 00:09:29,200
Well, I gotta go.

266
00:09:29,202 --> 00:09:30,368
Believe it or not,

267
00:09:30,370 --> 00:09:31,703
I have to go back to the office.

268
00:09:31,705 --> 00:09:32,571
Oh, I'll go out with you.

269
00:09:32,573 --> 00:09:33,638
Bye, guys.

270
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:37,342
You know, I wish everyone didn't
have to make fun

271
00:09:37,344 --> 00:09:38,443
Of that painting.

272
00:09:38,445 --> 00:09:40,178
Eh, we're not making fun
of the painting,

273
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:41,680
We're just making fun
of marshall.

274
00:09:41,682 --> 00:09:42,781
The painting's actually
really great.

275
00:09:42,783 --> 00:09:44,282
Are you serious?

276
00:09:44,284 --> 00:09:45,417
Yeah.

277
00:09:45,419 --> 00:09:47,252
Well, thank you.

278
00:09:47,254 --> 00:09:50,689
You know, seeing it again
makes me miss painting nudes.

279
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:54,392
What?

280
00:09:54,394 --> 00:09:57,062
(whispering):
Paint me.

281
00:09:57,064 --> 00:09:58,496
What?

282
00:09:59,265 --> 00:10:01,833
Paint me.

283
00:10:07,273 --> 00:10:08,273
Who's that?

284
00:10:08,275 --> 00:10:09,708
Who's out there?

285
00:10:09,710 --> 00:10:11,543
Hammond, is that you?

286
00:10:11,545 --> 00:10:13,878
Mosby?

287
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:16,581
<i>Druthers and I were alone
in the office.</i>

288
00:10:16,583 --> 00:10:18,249
<i>If I was gonna fire him,</i>

289
00:10:18,251 --> 00:10:20,151
<i>This would be the best chance
I'd ever have.</i>

290
00:10:20,153 --> 00:10:21,920
Uh, look, just a second, ted.

291
00:10:21,922 --> 00:10:24,389
Uh, no, I, I really need
to talk to you.

292
00:10:24,391 --> 00:10:26,324
Look, there's no easy way
to say...

293
00:10:26,326 --> 00:10:27,626
What, what are you doing?

294
00:10:28,794 --> 00:10:30,228
What are <i>you</i> doing?

295
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:32,564
I'm standing here wearing pants.

296
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:34,933
Are you sleeping here?

297
00:10:34,935 --> 00:10:36,334
What's going on?

298
00:10:36,336 --> 00:10:37,769
Okay, fine, yes.

299
00:10:37,771 --> 00:10:39,471
Not that it's any
of your business

300
00:10:39,473 --> 00:10:42,240
But my wife had a little spat
a few weeks ago,

301
00:10:42,242 --> 00:10:45,110
And I've been sleeping here
until she cools off.

302
00:10:45,112 --> 00:10:47,812
Okay, well, uh, you're right...
That is none of my business.

303
00:10:47,814 --> 00:10:49,948
Uh, look, there's no easy way
to say this... I...

304
00:10:49,950 --> 00:10:51,583
(voice breaking):
Who am I kidding?

305
00:10:51,585 --> 00:10:54,152
She's never gonna take me back.

306
00:10:55,021 --> 00:10:56,588
Uh...

307
00:10:59,692 --> 00:11:01,926
(sniffling, crying) it's okay.

308
00:11:07,299 --> 00:11:09,859
What did you want to say to me?

309
00:11:11,437 --> 00:11:13,972
Happy birthday, buddy.

310
00:11:13,974 --> 00:11:15,874
Oh...

311
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:24,549
So, you've been living
at the office?

312
00:11:24,551 --> 00:11:26,618
Yes.

313
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:29,521
I'm an architect without a home.

314
00:11:30,623 --> 00:11:31,990
You see the tragic
irony in that?

315
00:11:31,992 --> 00:11:34,125
Yeah, I do.
'cause I design homes.

316
00:11:34,127 --> 00:11:35,226
I see it.
But I don't have a home.

317
00:11:35,228 --> 00:11:37,062
Not lost on me at all.

318
00:11:37,064 --> 00:11:40,198
But I don't understand... why
don't you just go to a hotel?

319
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:43,068
You could be sleeping
on a mattress instead of...

320
00:11:43,070 --> 00:11:46,705
What appears to be torn-up
drawings of my building.

321
00:11:46,707 --> 00:11:48,173
The minute I go to a hotel,
in any second,

322
00:11:48,175 --> 00:11:50,295
She's going to call
and tell me to come home.

323
00:11:51,644 --> 00:11:55,046
She's a very special lady, ted.

324
00:11:55,048 --> 00:11:58,750
She's quite... Mannish.

325
00:11:59,985 --> 00:12:02,053
She gives me what I need.

326
00:12:02,055 --> 00:12:03,221
Do you understand that?

327
00:12:03,223 --> 00:12:06,658
Uh, no, I don't.

328
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:09,327
If you were lost
in the wilderness,

329
00:12:09,329 --> 00:12:11,730
She can provide for me.

330
00:12:11,732 --> 00:12:14,499
Well, that's the dream.

331
00:12:14,501 --> 00:12:17,902
I'm glad you came
here tonight, ted.

332
00:12:17,904 --> 00:12:19,070
Me too, hammond.

333
00:12:19,072 --> 00:12:19,938
Call me ham.

334
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:20,371
No, thanks.

335
00:12:20,373 --> 00:12:21,406
Hammy d?

336
00:12:21,408 --> 00:12:22,528
No, I think just hammond.

337
00:12:24,043 --> 00:12:26,111
So, I'm guessing you
didn't fire him.

338
00:12:28,214 --> 00:12:31,716
I was this close.

339
00:12:31,718 --> 00:12:34,119
Ted: <i>Meanwhile, lily
had been up all night</i>

340
00:12:34,121 --> 00:12:35,920
<i>In the grips of a dilemma.</i>

341
00:12:46,198 --> 00:12:48,199
Oh honey, you're awake?
I'm awake.

342
00:12:48,201 --> 00:12:49,601
Uh-huh.

343
00:12:49,603 --> 00:12:51,536
I everything okay?
Yeah.

344
00:12:51,538 --> 00:12:55,273
I've kind of been wrestling
with something.

345
00:12:55,275 --> 00:12:57,408
What if I told you I had
a way to pay for our honeymoon?

346
00:12:57,410 --> 00:12:59,644
Baby, our honeymoon's
already paid for.

347
00:12:59,646 --> 00:13:01,813
We're going to howe caverns.

348
00:13:01,815 --> 00:13:04,449
Well yeah, but... but what if
we didn't want to spend

349
00:13:04,451 --> 00:13:06,751
Our honeymoon in a cave?

350
00:13:06,753 --> 00:13:10,622
It's not just a cave, it's
a whole labyrinth of caves.

351
00:13:10,624 --> 00:13:11,890
It's an underground adventure.

352
00:13:11,892 --> 00:13:13,491
There's a cave

353
00:13:13,493 --> 00:13:15,460
That's so dark that you don't
even know you're in there.

354
00:13:15,462 --> 00:13:16,561
I mean, we're going
to experience

355
00:13:16,563 --> 00:13:18,563
A whole new kind of dark.

356
00:13:18,565 --> 00:13:20,965
Well, what if I found a way

357
00:13:20,967 --> 00:13:22,734
To make a little extra money

358
00:13:22,736 --> 00:13:24,435
So that we spend our honeymoon

359
00:13:24,437 --> 00:13:27,806
Not in howe caverns,
but in scotland?

360
00:13:27,808 --> 00:13:29,607
Loch ness?

361
00:13:29,609 --> 00:13:31,576
Yeah. And you know,
edinburgh

362
00:13:31,578 --> 00:13:33,511
And the highlands and glasgow...

363
00:13:33,513 --> 00:13:37,315
Loch ness. Nessy.

364
00:13:37,317 --> 00:13:40,251
Baby, I would love to search
for the enchanted creature

365
00:13:40,253 --> 00:13:41,753
Of the emerald loch, but...

366
00:13:41,755 --> 00:13:43,288
We can't afford that.

367
00:13:43,290 --> 00:13:45,523
Maybe we can.

368
00:13:45,525 --> 00:13:49,494
Paint me.

369
00:13:49,496 --> 00:13:51,162
Okay, I don't get this.

370
00:13:51,164 --> 00:13:53,431
You've been making fun
of that painting all this time

371
00:13:53,433 --> 00:13:54,933
And now you want me
to paint you?

372
00:13:54,935 --> 00:13:57,635
We knew we could torture
marshall because he has shame.

373
00:13:57,637 --> 00:13:58,770
I do not.

374
00:13:58,772 --> 00:14:01,506
In my body, where the shame
gland should be,

375
00:14:01,508 --> 00:14:03,942
There's a second awesome gland.

376
00:14:03,944 --> 00:14:05,677
True story.

377
00:14:05,679 --> 00:14:08,213
Yeah, that's not the gland
I'm worried about painting.

378
00:14:08,215 --> 00:14:10,381
(chuckles) yeah.

379
00:14:10,383 --> 00:14:13,184
A nude barney is a challenge.

380
00:14:13,186 --> 00:14:16,855
But I think you're talented
enough to immortalize this.

381
00:14:17,957 --> 00:14:19,724
Now is the time... I'm 31.

382
00:14:19,726 --> 00:14:22,393
I'm at the peak
of my physical beauty.

383
00:14:22,395 --> 00:14:23,728
If I were a woman,

384
00:14:23,730 --> 00:14:26,564
I'd have passed it
long, long ago.

385
00:14:27,132 --> 00:14:29,300
<i>Long</i> ago.

386
00:14:29,302 --> 00:14:31,069
Forget it.

387
00:14:31,071 --> 00:14:33,905
I promised marshall he was the
only guy I would ever see naked.

388
00:14:33,907 --> 00:14:35,974
Aww...

389
00:14:35,976 --> 00:14:38,910
I'll give you $5,000.

390
00:14:38,912 --> 00:14:40,812
We're going to loch ness!

391
00:14:40,814 --> 00:14:41,814
Yeah!

392
00:14:44,383 --> 00:14:46,584
That cabby would not shut up.

393
00:14:46,586 --> 00:14:48,319
Yeah, we should
call him a gabby.

394
00:14:48,321 --> 00:14:50,455
I think it, you say it.

395
00:14:51,090 --> 00:14:52,924
Hey, uh...

396
00:14:52,926 --> 00:14:54,993
Thanks for putting me
up last night, buddy.

397
00:14:54,995 --> 00:14:56,761
Give 'em hell.

398
00:14:59,231 --> 00:15:01,032
Morning, team.

399
00:15:01,034 --> 00:15:03,334
So, I have given it
some thought,

400
00:15:03,336 --> 00:15:07,272
And I say we revisit columns.

401
00:15:07,274 --> 00:15:09,874
Oh, god, not this again.

402
00:15:09,876 --> 00:15:11,743
Ted, a man in a toga

403
00:15:11,745 --> 00:15:13,678
Just arrived and delivered
a parchment.

404
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:15,847
Let me read it:
(gibbering)

405
00:15:15,849 --> 00:15:17,515
Oh! It's from ancient greece.

406
00:15:17,517 --> 00:15:20,018
They want their basic
architectural elements back.

407
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:21,920
(laughing):
Oh, geez.

408
00:15:21,922 --> 00:15:22,587
What?

409
00:15:22,589 --> 00:15:24,022
You didn't hear me?

410
00:15:24,024 --> 00:15:25,290
Toga, parchment...

411
00:15:25,292 --> 00:15:26,758
(gibbering)

412
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:27,859
Can I see you for one second?

413
00:15:27,861 --> 00:15:30,929
Ooh, I'm in trouble now.

414
00:15:33,866 --> 00:15:35,133
(quietly):
What are you doing?

415
00:15:35,135 --> 00:15:36,634
I thought we were friends.

416
00:15:36,636 --> 00:15:38,870
You slept on my couch,
you ate my cereal.

417
00:15:38,872 --> 00:15:40,405
I tossed you more toilet paper.

418
00:15:40,407 --> 00:15:42,640
We <i>ar</i> friends.

419
00:15:42,642 --> 00:15:46,577
But that doesn't magically make
your bad ideas good.

420
00:15:46,579 --> 00:15:48,379
What? I don't believe this!

421
00:15:48,381 --> 00:15:50,448
You're, you're, you're
wearing my clothes!

422
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:51,916
And my girlfriend's...

423
00:15:51,918 --> 00:15:54,953
Sneakers... man, you have
weirdly small feet.

424
00:15:54,955 --> 00:15:57,288
Ted, I hope that you're
not going to let

425
00:15:57,290 --> 00:16:00,792
Our professional woes
interfere with our friendship,

426
00:16:00,794 --> 00:16:04,128
Because I really kind of
need you right now.

427
00:16:06,432 --> 00:16:08,599
Okay, let's get this over with.

428
00:16:08,601 --> 00:16:11,169
Hey, hey! I don't want you
phoning this in.

429
00:16:11,171 --> 00:16:14,072
This painting could, someday,
become a serious work of art.

430
00:16:14,074 --> 00:16:16,140
I mean, you have been blessed
with an amazing gift.

431
00:16:16,142 --> 00:16:17,942
Thank you.

432
00:16:17,944 --> 00:16:19,711
I meant me.

433
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:23,614
Now, I like how you captured
marshall's essence.

434
00:16:23,616 --> 00:16:25,850
Goofy and unburdened, with wit.

435
00:16:25,852 --> 00:16:28,453
But me, I want something
more regal.

436
00:16:28,455 --> 00:16:30,855
Something my progeny
could look at and say,

437
00:16:30,857 --> 00:16:33,491
"there's stands
barnabus stinson."

438
00:16:33,493 --> 00:16:35,793
He was wise...

439
00:16:35,795 --> 00:16:38,596
And strong.

440
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:41,366
I don't think your sword
will fit.

441
00:16:41,368 --> 00:16:43,167
(scoffs) I get that a lot.

442
00:16:44,603 --> 00:16:46,838
Ted:
And so, as lily began painting,

443
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:48,940
<i>Marshall thought about
the $5,000</i>

444
00:16:48,942 --> 00:16:51,376
<i>And what his fianc?e
was doing to earn it.</i>

445
00:16:51,378 --> 00:16:53,945
This isn't right.

446
00:16:53,947 --> 00:16:55,947
This isn't right at all.

447
00:16:55,949 --> 00:16:58,383
<i>Finally, he could take
it no more.</i>

448
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:03,955
Hold still.

449
00:17:04,957 --> 00:17:06,257
Hold still.

450
00:17:07,993 --> 00:17:10,028
Hold still!

451
00:17:10,030 --> 00:17:11,729
Paint faster!

452
00:17:13,298 --> 00:17:16,601
Okay, I guess it's time.

453
00:17:17,403 --> 00:17:18,703
Drop your shorts.

454
00:17:18,705 --> 00:17:21,372
(laughing):
Yeah.

455
00:17:21,374 --> 00:17:22,673
Wait, wait!

456
00:17:22,675 --> 00:17:24,242
That wasn't enough buildup.

457
00:17:24,244 --> 00:17:25,209
I need...

458
00:17:25,211 --> 00:17:26,744
Uh... Ah!

459
00:17:26,746 --> 00:17:29,247
In a world without justice,
one man...

460
00:17:29,249 --> 00:17:30,782
Oh, just drop them!
All right.

461
00:17:32,084 --> 00:17:33,518
Oh!

462
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:35,887
No! No, this is not right!

463
00:17:35,889 --> 00:17:38,222
We had a deal! Well, I'm
going back on the deal.

464
00:17:38,224 --> 00:17:39,357
Barney, get out!
You...!

465
00:17:39,359 --> 00:17:41,125
(barney groaning) it's over!

466
00:17:43,862 --> 00:17:46,564
Lily, I can't let you
go through with this!

467
00:17:46,566 --> 00:17:49,867
(whispering): I found a castle we can
stay in, but it's an extra two grand.

468
00:17:49,869 --> 00:17:51,903
It's just not right!

469
00:17:51,905 --> 00:17:55,173
It's beautiful and they say
it's haunted.

470
00:17:55,175 --> 00:17:58,276
I can't let the woman I love
compromise her values for money!

471
00:17:58,278 --> 00:18:01,579
I totally think we can get some
more money out of him.

472
00:18:01,581 --> 00:18:03,848
I'm never letting
my fianc?e, ever...!

473
00:18:03,850 --> 00:18:05,383
Oh, you're still here?

474
00:18:05,385 --> 00:18:06,884
Before you say anything,

475
00:18:06,886 --> 00:18:09,486
I'll give you an extra five grand.
We accept.

476
00:18:10,689 --> 00:18:13,424
You people are so easy
to control.

477
00:18:13,426 --> 00:18:16,060
Dance for me, puppets, dance.

478
00:18:16,062 --> 00:18:17,728
Ted:
<i>And that's how uncle barney</i>

479
00:18:17,730 --> 00:18:19,797
<i>Paid for lily and marshall's
honeymoon.</i>

480
00:18:22,034 --> 00:18:24,402
Come on, ted, listen,
why don't we get back

481
00:18:24,404 --> 00:18:26,270
And finish drawing the plans
for a building

482
00:18:26,272 --> 00:18:28,539
Which, in my opinion,
is never going to get built,

483
00:18:28,541 --> 00:18:31,209
So you and I can get out of here
and grab a couple of beers.

484
00:18:31,211 --> 00:18:32,076
No.

485
00:18:32,078 --> 00:18:33,377
Look, hammond,

486
00:18:33,379 --> 00:18:35,746
There's no easy way
to say this but...

487
00:18:35,748 --> 00:18:36,914
Messenger:
Looking for hammond druthers.

488
00:18:36,916 --> 00:18:38,876
Oh, that's me.
I'm hammond druthers.

489
00:18:39,585 --> 00:18:41,686
These are divorce papers.

490
00:18:42,621 --> 00:18:44,388
You've been served.

491
00:18:44,390 --> 00:18:46,090
Oh, god.

492
00:18:46,092 --> 00:18:48,493
She's really going
through with this.

493
00:18:48,495 --> 00:18:51,429
So that's it. It's over.

494
00:18:51,431 --> 00:18:54,332
There is no easy way
to say this, but...

495
00:18:54,334 --> 00:18:56,868
She's giving me
the remains of wolfie?

496
00:18:57,803 --> 00:18:59,270
My dog is dead?

497
00:18:59,272 --> 00:19:01,439
Oh, my god.

498
00:19:01,441 --> 00:19:02,640
I can't believe this.

499
00:19:02,642 --> 00:19:06,611
She always played
too rough with him.

500
00:19:06,613 --> 00:19:09,647
Believe me, there is no easy
way to say this...

501
00:19:09,649 --> 00:19:12,250
Group:
? happy birthday to you...

502
00:19:12,252 --> 00:19:13,417
You've got to be kidding me!

503
00:19:13,419 --> 00:19:14,685
Guys, you have no idea

504
00:19:14,687 --> 00:19:16,687
How much this means
to me right now.

505
00:19:16,689 --> 00:19:18,122
Wait, his birthday
was yesterday!

506
00:19:18,124 --> 00:19:19,790
Yeah, but a bunch of us
were up at the conference

507
00:19:19,792 --> 00:19:21,159
In montreal, so we thought...

508
00:19:21,161 --> 00:19:23,361
No! No birthday! No!

509
00:19:23,363 --> 00:19:24,462
I got something to say

510
00:19:24,464 --> 00:19:26,030
And I'm gonna get it out.

511
00:19:26,032 --> 00:19:27,798
Hammond, listen to me.

512
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:29,300
I am sorry that your dog died,

513
00:19:29,302 --> 00:19:31,435
And that your wife is
divorcing you and that...

514
00:19:31,437 --> 00:19:35,306
Your life is falling apart and that
these guys missed your birthday.

515
00:19:35,308 --> 00:19:36,374
And there is no easy way
to say...

516
00:19:36,376 --> 00:19:37,375
What are you doing?
What's going on?

517
00:19:37,377 --> 00:19:40,011
(gasping):
Oh, god...

518
00:19:40,013 --> 00:19:41,646
Oh, come on, you're not going
to pull that, are you?

519
00:19:41,648 --> 00:19:44,949
Oh! Look, yeah, right.

520
00:19:44,951 --> 00:19:47,351
Now we're falling
onto the ground.

521
00:19:47,353 --> 00:19:50,354
Well, nice try, but guess what?

522
00:19:50,356 --> 00:19:52,056
You're fired!

523
00:19:52,058 --> 00:19:55,193
You're fired... you get it?
You hear me?

524
00:19:55,195 --> 00:19:56,794
You're gone! You're fired!

525
00:20:01,233 --> 00:20:03,801
(staff applauding)

526
00:20:14,546 --> 00:20:17,515
In my defense, I think
we all suspected hammond

527
00:20:17,517 --> 00:20:19,283
Might have been faking.

528
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:23,588
On the plus side,
the emts seem to think

529
00:20:23,590 --> 00:20:26,023
He's going to be just fine
and, as you saw,

530
00:20:26,025 --> 00:20:28,926
They did admit that I did not
cause the heart attack,

531
00:20:28,928 --> 00:20:31,862
Even if they said it
a bit begrudgingly.

532
00:20:31,864 --> 00:20:35,266
<i>And there it was, rock bottom:</i>

533
00:20:35,268 --> 00:20:37,368
<i>They all hated me.</i>

534
00:20:37,370 --> 00:20:39,904
<i>But just when all seemed lost,</i>

535
