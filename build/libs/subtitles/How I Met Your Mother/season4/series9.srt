1
00:00:01,344 --> 00:00:02,921
<i>Kids, everyone has an opinion</i>

2
00:00:03,046 --> 00:00:05,171
<i>on how long it takes
to recover from a breakup.</i>

3
00:00:05,474 --> 00:00:07,340
Half the length of the relationship.

4
00:00:07,508 --> 00:00:09,342
One week for every month
you were together.

5
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:12,648
Exactly 10,000 drinks.
However long that takes.

6
00:00:12,888 --> 00:00:15,314
You can't measure something
like this in time.

7
00:00:15,439 --> 00:00:16,891
There's a series of steps.

8
00:00:17,309 --> 00:00:20,639
From her bed to the front door.
Bam! Out of there. Next!

9
00:00:21,801 --> 00:00:23,345
<i>But I think you start to recover</i>

10
00:00:23,470 --> 00:00:26,344
<i>the moment you meet that person
who gets you back in the game.</i>

11
00:00:27,438 --> 00:00:30,100
<i>This is the story of
how I met that person.</i>

12
00:00:38,215 --> 00:00:41,707
<i>Now, kids, if you want
to go swimming, you don't just dive in.</i>

13
00:00:42,317 --> 00:00:44,284
<i>First, you dip your toe
in the water.</i>

14
00:00:55,024 --> 00:00:57,553
<i>You check the temperature.
See how it feels.</i>

15
00:00:58,871 --> 00:00:59,871
I'm Ted.

16
00:01:01,408 --> 00:01:02,311
Vicky.

17
00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:32,678
<i>And then you slowly wade in.</i>

18
00:01:32,973 --> 00:01:34,742
I got left at the altar a month ago.

19
00:01:34,867 --> 00:01:36,247
<i>Or, you know, cannonball.</i>

20
00:01:36,372 --> 00:01:39,121
It was a complete disaster
and ever since then,

21
00:01:39,246 --> 00:01:41,801
I haven't been able to even
look at another woman.

22
00:01:42,936 --> 00:01:45,973
Except for the old lady on the subway
who break-dances for nickels.

23
00:01:46,261 --> 00:01:48,606
I don't look at her that way.
I just look at her.

24
00:01:48,731 --> 00:01:50,983
I mean,
it's an old lady break-dancing.

25
00:01:51,288 --> 00:01:52,517
And she is good.

26
00:01:53,205 --> 00:01:55,281
I'm going to give her
a dollar next time.

27
00:01:56,589 --> 00:01:58,734
Hey, let's pretend I just said this:

28
00:01:59,226 --> 00:02:01,899
These elevator rides have been
the highlight of my week,

29
00:02:02,024 --> 00:02:04,523
and I'd love to see you
again Friday night.

30
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:06,368
Not in the elevator.

31
00:02:06,876 --> 00:02:08,553
At restaurant, a nice one.

32
00:02:09,296 --> 00:02:10,607
What do you say?

33
00:02:12,703 --> 00:02:13,526
Yes.

34
00:02:14,176 --> 00:02:16,637
Synchro: ShalimarFox, Arrow

35
00:02:27,893 --> 00:02:32,026
<i>I walked in on a lot of crazy stuff
at the old apartment over the years.</i>

36
00:02:35,053 --> 00:02:38,074
Sorry, guys. I'm just going
to go with a bowl of fruit.

37
00:02:39,995 --> 00:02:41,888
It's been 12 minutes!

38
00:02:46,582 --> 00:02:48,334
- Drop it!
- You first!

39
00:02:48,502 --> 00:02:50,106
Why are you pointing your gun at me?

40
00:02:50,231 --> 00:02:53,005
- Don't use my name!
- Put the guns down, now!

41
00:02:58,610 --> 00:03:00,763
<i>But one of the craziest things
I ever walked in on</i>

42
00:03:00,888 --> 00:03:03,265
<i>happened when I was roommates
with your Aunt Robin.</i>

43
00:03:13,351 --> 00:03:14,437
Who are you?

44
00:03:14,864 --> 00:03:15,721
Mitch.

45
00:03:18,251 --> 00:03:21,534
- What you doing, Mitch?
- Oh, you must be the roommate.

46
00:03:22,244 --> 00:03:23,557
I'm on a date with Robin.

47
00:03:23,682 --> 00:03:25,949
She had to step outside
to take a call.

48
00:03:26,074 --> 00:03:28,207
I guess her cell phone
doesn't work in here.

49
00:03:30,812 --> 00:03:34,021
Oh, Robin didn't use
the super secret signal.

50
00:03:34,419 --> 00:03:36,590
We put this old takeout menu
on the doorknob.

51
00:03:37,123 --> 00:03:38,596
Place went out of business.

52
00:03:38,721 --> 00:03:39,795
Mr. Wang's...

53
00:03:40,428 --> 00:03:42,429
Guess I don't have to explain
why that's funny.

54
00:03:43,557 --> 00:03:44,762
I'm gonna go.

55
00:03:48,401 --> 00:03:51,397
When you leave, take the seat cushion
with you. That's trash now.

56
00:03:53,235 --> 00:03:55,568
I think that I am more
than qualified for the job.

57
00:03:56,025 --> 00:03:57,159
My weaknesses?

58
00:03:57,937 --> 00:04:00,566
I would say caring too much,
working too hard,

59
00:04:00,691 --> 00:04:02,752
and putting my career
in front of my love life.

60
00:04:02,877 --> 00:04:04,285
That last one was real.

61
00:04:04,453 --> 00:04:05,453
What?

62
00:04:08,173 --> 00:04:10,124
Well, it appears our sweet,

63
00:04:10,292 --> 00:04:12,672
innocent, little Robin
has taken a lover.

64
00:04:13,057 --> 00:04:15,254
A young blade by the name of Mitch.

65
00:04:15,631 --> 00:04:17,526
Her blind date? Total bust.

66
00:04:17,651 --> 00:04:19,835
She's been sending me
text messages all night.

67
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:22,761
She just let him go upstairs
to use the bathroom a second ago.

68
00:04:23,727 --> 00:04:25,175
Excuse me a minute.

69
00:04:28,687 --> 00:04:31,687
Buddy, you are killing me.
I'm in the middle of something here.

70
00:04:31,857 --> 00:04:32,980
Middle of what?

71
00:04:34,690 --> 00:04:35,942
This is my move.

72
00:04:36,475 --> 00:04:38,027
It's called, "The Naked Man."

73
00:04:38,335 --> 00:04:39,528
"The Naked Man"?

74
00:04:39,864 --> 00:04:40,949
Goes like this:

75
00:04:41,074 --> 00:04:43,824
you're on a first date,
you've had a few drinks,

76
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:46,582
<i>You make an excuse to go up
to the girl's apartment.</i>

77
00:04:46,707 --> 00:04:48,120
The bathroom's right there.

78
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:51,707
You know what,
I'm going to grab this.

79
00:04:53,330 --> 00:04:55,461
<i>Then, once she leaves the room,</i>

80
00:04:55,765 --> 00:04:57,878
<i>you strip down naked and wait.</i>

81
00:04:58,652 --> 00:05:00,057
<i>When she comes back,</i>

82
00:05:00,487 --> 00:05:01,626
<i>she laughs.</i>

83
00:05:02,554 --> 00:05:04,655
<i>She's so charmed
by your confidence and bravado,</i>

84
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:06,597
<i>she sleeps with you. Boom!</i>

85
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:12,144
- There is no way that works!
- Two out of three times.

86
00:05:12,742 --> 00:05:14,355
Two out of three times?

87
00:05:14,523 --> 00:05:17,316
Two out of three times.
You just have to pick your spot.

88
00:05:17,915 --> 00:05:20,152
"The Naked Man" is best used
as a last resort,

89
00:05:20,727 --> 00:05:22,679
kind of a Hail Mary on a first date

90
00:05:22,804 --> 00:05:24,823
when you know there's not
going to be a second one.

91
00:05:24,993 --> 00:05:26,450
How do you know that?

92
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:28,661
- Ted, look at me.
- I'd rather not.

93
00:05:29,595 --> 00:05:31,372
Robin is way out of my league.

94
00:05:31,669 --> 00:05:34,306
I'm not smart, funny or handsome.

95
00:05:34,711 --> 00:05:36,673
As you can plainly see,
there's nothing impressive

96
00:05:36,798 --> 00:05:38,587
going on anywhere around here.

97
00:05:39,965 --> 00:05:42,802
My only shot with a girl like Robin
is the element of surprise.

98
00:05:42,927 --> 00:05:44,429
And, let's be honest,

99
00:05:44,804 --> 00:05:45,920
a little pity.

100
00:05:46,555 --> 00:05:48,313
It's shock and "aw".

101
00:05:49,843 --> 00:05:52,705
- This doesn't really work.
- Two out of three times.

102
00:05:53,203 --> 00:05:54,278
Guaranteed.

103
00:05:55,272 --> 00:05:56,146
No way.

104
00:05:56,314 --> 00:05:58,222
Two out of three times.

105
00:05:58,481 --> 00:06:00,942
- He guaranteed it.
- Oh, come on.

106
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:03,246
There is no way
that's gonna work on Robin.

107
00:06:03,371 --> 00:06:05,531
She's going to walk in there,
take one look at that idiot

108
00:06:05,803 --> 00:06:08,473
- and send him packing.
- She might kick his ass first.

109
00:06:08,598 --> 00:06:10,995
Yeah, she might get
her gun and shoot him.

110
00:06:16,111 --> 00:06:16,875
Go, go!

111
00:06:19,245 --> 00:06:20,238
My God!

112
00:06:20,717 --> 00:06:21,727
It worked.

113
00:06:21,998 --> 00:06:24,218
Mr. Wang's is back to business.

114
00:06:29,650 --> 00:06:31,703
"The Naked Man" works!

115
00:06:32,153 --> 00:06:35,060
This is gonna revolutionize
the one-night stand!

116
00:06:35,333 --> 00:06:37,904
This is like the forward pass
in football.

117
00:06:38,175 --> 00:06:39,773
The slam dunk in basketball.

118
00:06:40,144 --> 00:06:42,045
The haircutting technique
where they hold it

119
00:06:42,170 --> 00:06:45,112
between their fingers and cut right
above it. It's a total game changer!

120
00:06:45,392 --> 00:06:49,151
Barney, this guy slept with Robin,
who you claim to be in love with.

121
00:06:49,276 --> 00:06:51,452
How can you be excited about this?

122
00:06:52,951 --> 00:06:55,998
"The Naked Man"
is bigger than me and Robin.

123
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:57,831
All these years,

124
00:06:57,956 --> 00:06:59,867
I have been busting my hump,

125
00:06:59,992 --> 00:07:01,702
with my secret identities

126
00:07:01,827 --> 00:07:04,173
and my tricks and my gadgets.

127
00:07:04,341 --> 00:07:06,550
I mean, I'm like Batman.

128
00:07:06,817 --> 00:07:08,724
But this Mitch fellow,
he's Superman.

129
00:07:08,849 --> 00:07:10,637
He rips off his clothes
and he's good to go.

130
00:07:11,354 --> 00:07:13,349
What kind of gadgets
are we talking about?

131
00:07:15,185 --> 00:07:17,895
This is what it's gonna be like,
us living together? I come home,

132
00:07:18,063 --> 00:07:20,923
and guys you're dating are just gonna
be sitting on the couch, naked.

133
00:07:21,048 --> 00:07:22,649
I wish I could say no.

134
00:07:23,382 --> 00:07:26,454
I still cannot believe
the "Naked Man" worked on you.

135
00:07:26,671 --> 00:07:27,931
What can I say?

136
00:07:28,056 --> 00:07:30,380
Okay, I went in there,
and he was naked.

137
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:31,847
It was funny.

138
00:07:31,972 --> 00:07:33,680
I laughed, he laughed.

139
00:07:34,578 --> 00:07:36,205
And then it just kind of happened.

140
00:07:36,718 --> 00:07:37,908
I don't know.

141
00:07:40,335 --> 00:07:42,519
- I call "slut!"
- Slut?

142
00:07:43,048 --> 00:07:44,213
Excuse me?

143
00:07:44,381 --> 00:07:46,550
I'm sorry, Robin, but you
hooking up with this guy

144
00:07:46,675 --> 00:07:49,885
makes it seem like the only thing
standing between you and sex is clothes.

145
00:07:51,165 --> 00:07:53,995
I didn't just sleep with
Mitch because he was naked.

146
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:56,744
- Then why did you sleep with him?
- Because...

147
00:07:56,869 --> 00:07:57,703
He...

148
00:07:58,688 --> 00:08:02,093
He... because I care about Mitch.

149
00:08:02,804 --> 00:08:03,948
A lot.

150
00:08:04,182 --> 00:08:06,504
There was a... connection

151
00:08:07,079 --> 00:08:08,381
of specialness.

152
00:08:10,267 --> 00:08:11,740
Specialness and feelings.

153
00:08:12,246 --> 00:08:13,698
It was because he was naked.

154
00:08:13,823 --> 00:08:17,086
And I'm sorry, but I don't approve.
There is only one reason

155
00:08:17,565 --> 00:08:20,249
to sleep with somebody,
and that is "love."

156
00:08:22,587 --> 00:08:25,273
Marshall's a big girl
because he believes in true love

157
00:08:25,398 --> 00:08:26,979
and finished reading "The Notebook"

158
00:08:27,104 --> 00:08:29,648
`cause the secretaries bullied him
into joining Oprah's Book Club.

159
00:08:29,773 --> 00:08:31,350
But you know I'm right.

160
00:08:31,475 --> 00:08:34,760
I love you, but there's
lots of reasons to have sex.

161
00:08:35,228 --> 00:08:37,069
- Name one.
- I can name 50.

162
00:08:37,194 --> 00:08:40,507
- No, you can't.
- Number one: last Thursday.

163
00:08:47,153 --> 00:08:49,491
- Hey, Marshall, want to do it?
- I'm up.

164
00:08:51,188 --> 00:08:55,063
You befouled our marital bed
because you couldn't get to sleep?

165
00:08:55,662 --> 00:08:57,958
You're the one who said,
"That shadow on the ceiling

166
00:08:58,083 --> 00:09:00,456
"looks like a scary toothless clown.
Good night, Lily."

167
00:09:01,462 --> 00:09:04,393
Fine! That's one.
But I defy you to name...

168
00:09:04,518 --> 00:09:06,005
I'm going to name 50.

169
00:09:06,225 --> 00:09:08,130
There's "makeup" sex...

170
00:09:08,598 --> 00:09:09,631
"breakup" sex,

171
00:09:09,915 --> 00:09:13,093
and "your friend just told you
about a new-position" sex.

172
00:09:13,263 --> 00:09:14,695
You're welcome.

173
00:09:15,305 --> 00:09:16,861
There's also "revenge",

174
00:09:17,118 --> 00:09:19,585
"rebound", "paratrooping."

175
00:09:20,517 --> 00:09:22,458
When you go out of
town but instead of getting

176
00:09:22,583 --> 00:09:24,778
a hotel room, you go straight
to a bar with the intention

177
00:09:24,903 --> 00:09:26,982
of hooking up with a girl
so you have a place to stay.

178
00:09:27,152 --> 00:09:29,710
- Oh, you mean "banging for roof".
- Slut!

179
00:09:30,408 --> 00:09:32,696
I don't do it.
My college roommate did it.

180
00:09:32,866 --> 00:09:36,950
No, Robin, I just have a bad cough.
I don't really have a bad cough.

181
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:40,472
We all know
"college roommate" means you, slut!

182
00:09:42,211 --> 00:09:43,540
Does anyone have a lozenge?

183
00:09:45,386 --> 00:09:48,253
I've got one.
"Nothing good on television" sex.

184
00:09:49,047 --> 00:09:50,535
"Hotel room" sex.

185
00:09:51,009 --> 00:09:52,007
"Curiosity",

186
00:09:52,350 --> 00:09:53,217
as in...

187
00:09:53,385 --> 00:09:56,735
"I've always wondered what it's like
to have sex with a really tall girl."

188
00:09:56,860 --> 00:09:58,095
Not a big girl,

189
00:09:58,587 --> 00:10:00,106
just a tall girl.

190
00:10:01,364 --> 00:10:02,350
Like...

191
00:10:02,691 --> 00:10:04,158
if a normal girl

192
00:10:04,646 --> 00:10:08,203
were seven,
seven-and-a-half-feet tall

193
00:10:08,536 --> 00:10:12,194
and... wore a denim miniskirt.

194
00:10:13,364 --> 00:10:15,399
I would have to know
what that is like.

195
00:10:18,837 --> 00:10:21,827
"He said he loved you, but you're not
ready to say it back yet" sex.

196
00:10:21,997 --> 00:10:23,047
Forty-three.

197
00:10:23,683 --> 00:10:25,666
"Wingman diving on
the friend grenade."

198
00:10:25,835 --> 00:10:26,885
Forty-four.

199
00:10:27,502 --> 00:10:30,800
- "The condoms are about to expire."
- Forty-five.

200
00:10:35,265 --> 00:10:38,219
- This is getting a little hard.
- Forty-six!

201
00:10:41,392 --> 00:10:43,002
Okay, four more to go.

202
00:10:43,736 --> 00:10:47,399
"You dropped a Cheeto on his lap
and when you reached for it,

203
00:10:47,524 --> 00:10:50,065
"he thought you were making a move,
so you just went with it."

204
00:10:51,504 --> 00:10:54,754
Thank you for ruing the memory
of our six-month anniversary.

205
00:10:54,879 --> 00:10:56,320
You got me Cheetos.

206
00:10:57,157 --> 00:10:59,425
Look, can we just stop
with this stupid list?

207
00:10:59,566 --> 00:11:02,911
- Okay, you guys are making me sad.
- No, I'm having fun.

208
00:11:03,206 --> 00:11:06,415
Man, this whole "one-partner"
thing sucks sometimes.

209
00:11:06,584 --> 00:11:09,750
I'm always talking about you.
I can't play "I never"

210
00:11:10,254 --> 00:11:13,695
because then everyone would know
all the weird stuff I let you do to me.

211
00:11:14,091 --> 00:11:15,770
The only weird thing
I ever did to you

212
00:11:15,895 --> 00:11:18,170
was open up my heart and soul
when all I had to do

213
00:11:18,295 --> 00:11:20,177
was strip naked
while you were out of the room.

214
00:11:20,302 --> 00:11:22,848
I didn't sleep with Mitch
because he was naked!

215
00:11:23,384 --> 00:11:25,227
Mitch and I have something special.

216
00:11:25,352 --> 00:11:27,660
I mean, fingers crossed, guys.
He may be the one.

217
00:11:27,785 --> 00:11:30,272
- The one?
- Mitch? The Naked Man?

218
00:11:30,636 --> 00:11:34,263
You mean the naked genius.
All these years I've been suiting up

219
00:11:34,388 --> 00:11:37,211
when I should have been suiting down.
That's it.

220
00:11:37,572 --> 00:11:39,975
I am doing "The Naked Man" tonight.

221
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:41,282
- So are you.
- What?

222
00:11:41,683 --> 00:11:44,452
With the elevator girl. You're going out
with her tonight, right? "Naked Man!"

223
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:46,398
Come on, this is the first girl

224
00:11:46,523 --> 00:11:48,498
I've had the courage
to ask out since Stella.

225
00:11:48,668 --> 00:11:49,625
"Naked Man"!

226
00:11:49,794 --> 00:11:51,829
This is the eighth outfit
I tried on tonight!

227
00:11:51,954 --> 00:11:54,744
I got my hair cut three times!
I'm a nervous wreck!

228
00:11:55,038 --> 00:11:56,552
Are you wearing makeup?

229
00:11:57,965 --> 00:11:58,926
It's not makeup!

230
00:11:59,339 --> 00:12:02,012
Okay, it's a sunscreen
with a subtle tint of...

231
00:12:03,306 --> 00:12:04,638
It's made for men.

232
00:12:05,994 --> 00:12:07,802
Sue me, I want my eyes to pop.

233
00:12:10,152 --> 00:12:11,271
"Naked Man"!

234
00:12:11,441 --> 00:12:14,397
No, Barney, I like Vicky.
This could actually go somewhere.

235
00:12:14,522 --> 00:12:16,897
I don't want to do anything
stupid to jeopardize it.

236
00:12:17,022 --> 00:12:19,417
Well, I really like...

237
00:12:19,949 --> 00:12:21,387
that girl, but...

238
00:12:21,825 --> 00:12:23,676
I didn't see her from the back.

239
00:12:24,162 --> 00:12:25,481
I really like...

240
00:12:26,103 --> 00:12:27,037
that girl.

241
00:12:27,526 --> 00:12:31,416
And I'm willing to jeopardize our
future together for one night of glory.

242
00:12:33,277 --> 00:12:34,294
Naked Man!

243
00:12:36,152 --> 00:12:38,507
<i>So, that night we all set
out to prove something.</i>

244
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:40,732
<i>Robin wanted to defend her honor.</i>

245
00:12:40,857 --> 00:12:43,150
Mitch, hey, baby, it's me.

246
00:12:46,331 --> 00:12:48,291
Do you want to grab
some dinner tonight?

247
00:12:49,399 --> 00:12:51,617
Because you're basically
my boyfriend!

248
00:12:52,842 --> 00:12:55,499
<i>Lily needed to prove
that she could finish her list.</i>

249
00:12:55,782 --> 00:12:58,389
I'm stuck.
I can't think of the last two.

250
00:13:00,948 --> 00:13:02,284
Reason number 48:

251
00:13:02,409 --> 00:13:06,160
"To reinforce good behaviors
such as shaving and dental hygiene."

252
00:13:06,285 --> 00:13:08,082
Now you're conditioning me? Great!

253
00:13:08,207 --> 00:13:10,664
That explains why I always get
an erection when I floss.

254
00:13:12,529 --> 00:13:15,348
<i>I had to prove that as scary
as it was to be dating again,</i>

255
00:13:15,473 --> 00:13:18,095
<i>I was over Stella
and ready to get back out there.</i>

256
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:21,549
And Barney needed to prove that he, too,
could pull off "The Naked Man."

257
00:13:21,718 --> 00:13:23,662
Thank you for letting me
look at your aquarium.

258
00:13:23,787 --> 00:13:26,168
- You're a real life saver.
- Sure, no problem.

259
00:13:26,293 --> 00:13:28,866
I just need to use the bathroom
and I'll be on my way.

260
00:13:36,006 --> 00:13:37,662
Ted, I'm doing it.

261
00:13:38,042 --> 00:13:39,692
I'm doing the "Naked Man"!

262
00:13:40,042 --> 00:13:41,042
Me, too!

263
00:13:42,604 --> 00:13:43,413
You...

264
00:13:46,623 --> 00:13:48,827
I'm doing it!
I'm doing The Naked Man!

265
00:13:48,995 --> 00:13:51,495
That's great!
What made you change your mind?

266
00:13:51,665 --> 00:13:55,417
The date with Vicky started off okay,
but... it didn't go as well as I hoped.

267
00:13:55,924 --> 00:13:58,544
Oh, my God!
Ted, you are so funny!

268
00:13:59,672 --> 00:14:02,215
And can I just say,
you have amazing eyes.

269
00:14:02,437 --> 00:14:03,884
What, these old things?

270
00:14:04,761 --> 00:14:07,763
- Oh! Nice job, hot shot.
- I'm sorry.

271
00:14:07,931 --> 00:14:10,557
Save it! Go tell the manager
he owes us an appetizer.

272
00:14:11,769 --> 00:14:13,559
One of the ones with shrimp!

273
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:15,436
You're welcome.
You were saying?

274
00:14:16,462 --> 00:14:19,445
And then his cane
missed the top step,

275
00:14:19,570 --> 00:14:22,778
and he was falling, for,
I swear, like two minutes.

276
00:14:24,949 --> 00:14:27,574
Oh, God, I love old people.

277
00:14:29,384 --> 00:14:32,258
Once I realized there was
no possible future in this relationship,

278
00:14:32,383 --> 00:14:35,840
- I just decided to go for it.
- Awesome! Okay, big question:

279
00:14:35,965 --> 00:14:39,236
What pose will you display
your "Naked Man" in?

280
00:14:40,945 --> 00:14:43,172
That is a big question.
I hadn't really thought about it.

281
00:14:43,341 --> 00:14:45,218
I was thinking the "Superman".

282
00:14:47,649 --> 00:14:49,888
What about the "Captain Morgan"?

283
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:54,624
How about the
"Oops, I didn't see you there"?

284
00:14:56,938 --> 00:14:58,236
The Thinker?

285
00:14:59,609 --> 00:15:01,219
What about the Heisman?

286
00:15:02,527 --> 00:15:03,681
Mr. Clean?

287
00:15:06,282 --> 00:15:07,714
The Burt Reynolds.

288
00:15:15,623 --> 00:15:17,207
It's so great to see you again.

289
00:15:20,914 --> 00:15:23,129
I really had a great time
last night.

290
00:15:28,663 --> 00:15:31,159
So, what is it like
managing a C.P.K.?

291
00:15:31,438 --> 00:15:33,515
I mean, who's idea was it
to put a pineapple in the...

292
00:15:33,683 --> 00:15:36,101
Okay, stop right there.
I know what this is.

293
00:15:36,859 --> 00:15:39,980
I've been on this date before.
This is the "I'm not a slut" date.

294
00:15:40,495 --> 00:15:42,538
What? That's crazy.

295
00:15:42,663 --> 00:15:45,609
Usually you read me so well,
but this time you're wrong.

296
00:15:45,791 --> 00:15:48,620
Come on, Robin.
One of us had a good time last night,

297
00:15:48,745 --> 00:15:50,073
and we both know it was me.

298
00:15:50,634 --> 00:15:54,544
Oh, Mitchell... Something,
that is, that is just not true!

299
00:15:55,247 --> 00:15:58,247
- Really? How was the sex?
- I didn't hate it.

300
00:15:58,417 --> 00:16:00,412
Robin, you've seen my move.

301
00:16:01,111 --> 00:16:02,333
That's it.

302
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:04,894
I have nothing else to offer you.

303
00:16:05,173 --> 00:16:06,981
I'm broke, I sweat when I eat,

304
00:16:07,106 --> 00:16:09,361
and I'm in, like,
5 different fantasy football leagues.

305
00:16:09,486 --> 00:16:10,813
It's all I talk about.

306
00:16:11,135 --> 00:16:12,888
Trust me,
you don't wanna be around that.

307
00:16:13,056 --> 00:16:15,162
What? Yes, I do!

308
00:16:15,462 --> 00:16:18,184
Look, I didn't just sleep
with you because you were naked.

309
00:16:18,353 --> 00:16:20,723
Yeah, you did.
And now you're trying to pretend

310
00:16:20,848 --> 00:16:23,023
it was something more
to make yourself feel better.

311
00:16:23,775 --> 00:16:25,061
Say what you will,

312
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:27,776
at least "The Naked Man" is honest.

313
00:16:29,072 --> 00:16:31,278
What about the ol'
"Coppertone Baby"?

314
00:16:34,995 --> 00:16:37,438
The Olympic gymnast
who stuck the landing.

315
00:16:40,749 --> 00:16:42,785
- Yeah, I got to go.
- Naked Man!

316
00:16:46,465 --> 00:16:48,216
You have a really nice place!

317
00:16:48,341 --> 00:16:51,127
Oh, thanks! Coming from you,
that's a real compliment.

318
00:16:51,252 --> 00:16:53,719
I just love that you're an architect,
it's so fascinating.

319
00:16:53,889 --> 00:16:57,109
I could listen to you talk
about structural design all night.

320
00:16:58,436 --> 00:17:00,307
<i>And then I noticed,
lying on her end table,</i>

321
00:17:00,432 --> 00:17:02,520
<i>a book of love poems
by Pablo Neruda.</i>

322
00:17:02,984 --> 00:17:05,243
<i>The same edition
I'd had since college.</i>

323
00:17:05,368 --> 00:17:07,359
<i>And it was bookmarked
to my favorite poem.</i>

324
00:17:09,865 --> 00:17:12,101
<i>Maybe I was all wrong
about this girl.</i>

325
00:17:12,448 --> 00:17:14,362
<i>Maybe there was a future for us.</i>

326
00:17:15,718 --> 00:17:16,575
Crap!

327
00:17:22,872 --> 00:17:25,009
Here we go.

328
00:17:26,021 --> 00:17:27,277
Pablo Neruda.

329
00:17:28,049 --> 00:17:30,507
Oh, yeah, that book's a turd.

330
00:17:31,426 --> 00:17:34,844
Some douchey guy I hooked up
with left it here. It's all in Mexican.

331
00:17:36,013 --> 00:17:38,006
You know who writes good poems?

332
00:17:38,131 --> 00:17:41,602
Jewel. Her teeth are crooked
and she lived in a car.

333
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:44,737
So, she has stuff to write about.

334
00:18:01,164 --> 00:18:02,635
"The Naked Man" works!

335
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:04,947
I just had decent sex
with an awful human being.

336
00:18:05,072 --> 00:18:07,701
- I am back!
- Congratulations, buddy.

337
00:18:08,464 --> 00:18:10,880
You're not the only one who
rocked "The Naked Man" tonight.

338
00:18:12,199 --> 00:18:14,801
You just want to do it
to change the subject.

339
00:18:16,429 --> 00:18:18,053
Hey, that's number 49!

340
00:18:19,230 --> 00:18:20,139
Did it work?

341
00:18:21,229 --> 00:18:22,850
It's like I just flossed.

342
00:18:23,555 --> 00:18:24,601
I love you.

343
00:18:25,807 --> 00:18:26,828
That's 50.

344
00:18:29,553 --> 00:18:32,901
- Nice! What pose did you go with?
- I went with "I've got boobs".

345
00:18:33,071 --> 00:18:35,238
And she nailed it.

346
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:38,824
Oh, my God! Guys, guys, guys!
This is him!

347
00:18:38,993 --> 00:18:42,519
- This is "The Naked Man"!
- Ted, his name is Mitch.

348
00:18:42,644 --> 00:18:44,831
And... he's my boyfriend. So...

349
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:47,042
It's okay, Robin.
I no longer call "slut".

350
00:18:48,572 --> 00:18:50,743
- Okay. You can go. We're done.
- Thanks.

351
00:18:50,922 --> 00:18:53,371
Hold on, Mitch, Mitch,
I have to thank you.

352
00:18:53,638 --> 00:18:55,382
We all tried
"The Naked Man" tonight.

353
00:18:56,761 --> 00:18:58,422
We should see how Barney did.

354
00:19:02,934 --> 00:19:04,767
Hi, is... Is Barney there?

355
00:19:06,159 --> 00:19:08,542
Oh, my God!
What's the matter with you?

356
00:19:08,902 --> 00:19:10,477
- Get out!
- I have to grab my suit.

357
00:19:10,602 --> 00:19:13,172
- It's very expensive. The tie alone...
- Get out of here right now!

358
00:19:13,297 --> 00:19:16,201
- Get out, you sick son of a bitch!
- Call me.

359
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:20,950
And if I see him again,
I'm calling the cops.

360
00:19:24,806 --> 00:19:26,309
Two out of three times.

361
00:19:28,209 --> 00:19:29,974
I want you to know, this night,

362
00:19:30,099 --> 00:19:31,696
crazy as it was,

363
00:19:32,252 --> 00:19:35,582
- it got me out of my shell.
- That's the beauty of "The Naked Man".

364
00:19:35,707 --> 00:19:38,279
It gives you exactly what you need.
No more,

365
00:19:39,038 --> 00:19:39,969
no less.

366
00:19:41,306 --> 00:19:43,446
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I need to replace

367
00:19:43,571 --> 00:19:45,517
one of my fantasy football
quarterbacks.

368
00:19:46,196 --> 00:19:47,852
He separated his shoulder!

369
00:19:52,832 --> 00:19:53,854
A toast...

370
00:19:54,580 --> 00:19:55,590
to Mitch.

371
00:19:57,911 --> 00:20:00,436
By the sum of his parts,
he is just a man.

372
00:20:01,662 --> 00:20:04,536
What he does with those parts,
he becomes so much more.

373
00:20:05,110 --> 00:20:07,663
<i>He may not fit society's
definition of a hero,</i>

374
00:20:07,788 --> 00:20:09,638
<i>but he is the hero I needed.</i>

375
00:20:09,912 --> 00:20:12,033
<i>The hero who helped me
recover from the disaster</i>

376
00:20:12,158 --> 00:20:14,962
<i>of my failed almost-marriage
and get back into the game.</i>

377
00:20:15,353 --> 00:20:17,642
<i>He lives in the shadows.
Is he a dream?</i>

378
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:19,126
<i>Truth? Fiction?</i>

379
00:20:19,251 --> 00:20:20,917
<i>Damnation? Salvation?</i>

380
00:20:21,042 --> 00:20:22,849
<i>He is all these things
and none of them.</i>

381
00:20:22,974 --> 00:20:24,155
<i>For he is...</i>

382
00:20:24,542 --> 00:20:25,789
<i>"The Naked Man".</i>

383
00:20:29,729 --> 00:20:30,729
My God!

384
00:20:41,951 --> 00:20:43,199
Oh, thank God.
