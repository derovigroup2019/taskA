1
00:00:01,427 --> 00:00:03,544
<i>Kids, sophomore year of college,</i>

2
00:00:03,712 --> 00:00:05,526
<i>when Lily came back
from spring break,</i>

3
00:00:05,651 --> 00:00:07,632
<i>Marshall surprised her
at the airport.</i>

4
00:00:07,922 --> 00:00:10,914
<i>And she surprised him with
a six-pack of locally brewed beer.</i>

5
00:00:11,039 --> 00:00:13,012
Fort Lau-ger-Dale!
Get it?

6
00:00:13,713 --> 00:00:15,814
<i>And with that, a ritual was born.</i>

7
00:00:16,507 --> 00:00:19,305
<i>For the next 11 years, whenever
either of them would fly anywhere...</i>

8
00:00:19,430 --> 00:00:20,728
Minne-Cider!

9
00:00:20,896 --> 00:00:21,901
Get it?

10
00:00:22,216 --> 00:00:25,232
<i>... the reunion was always
commemorated with a chauffeur sign</i>

11
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:27,118
<i>and a six-pack from
wherever they'd been.</i>

12
00:00:27,243 --> 00:00:29,018
Aspen Yards Ale!

13
00:00:29,755 --> 00:00:31,739
- Get it?
- Actually, no.

14
00:00:31,907 --> 00:00:33,741
Me, neither.
I was hoping you would.

15
00:00:34,952 --> 00:00:38,120
<i>But, one night in January of 2009,
the unthinkable happened.</i>

16
00:00:38,397 --> 00:00:40,389
- I'm not picking her up.
- What?

17
00:00:40,895 --> 00:00:43,370
Lily doesn't want me taking a cab
all the way to the airport

18
00:00:43,495 --> 00:00:45,461
just to take a cab
all the way back, you know?

19
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:47,606
But the six-pack thing.

20
00:00:48,374 --> 00:00:51,804
That stuff was fun when we were younger,
but we've grown past that.

21
00:00:51,929 --> 00:00:54,887
As we mature,
the relationship matures with us.

22
00:00:55,252 --> 00:00:57,883
But... you guys are such
an inspiration to the rest of us,

23
00:00:58,008 --> 00:01:00,184
how you're so devoted and connected.

24
00:01:00,565 --> 00:01:03,688
I look at you guys, and that's
all I want in the whole world.

25
00:01:04,219 --> 00:01:07,379
Ted, there's two college girls outside,
and they look easy!

26
00:01:10,195 --> 00:01:11,479
Arizona, you know,

27
00:01:11,604 --> 00:01:14,281
I've always wanted to see what
an Arizona driver's license looks like.

28
00:01:14,449 --> 00:01:15,992
I already ran that play. They're 21.

29
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:18,786
We're good. Thank God.
So, what brings you guys to town?

30
00:01:18,954 --> 00:01:21,786
- Our band's got a gig.
- Oh, you're in a band?

31
00:01:21,911 --> 00:01:24,875
- Maybe we'll come see you play.
- Excuse us for a sec.

32
00:01:26,472 --> 00:01:28,129
What is the matter with you?

33
00:01:28,297 --> 00:01:30,638
- We're not gonna go see them play.
- Why not?

34
00:01:30,763 --> 00:01:32,661
If we see them play, we're no better

35
00:01:32,786 --> 00:01:36,595
than the bleach-blonde bimbos who flash
their boobs at a Van Halen concert.

36
00:01:36,854 --> 00:01:40,224
But don't those girls get to have sex
with Van Halen after the show?

37
00:01:40,392 --> 00:01:43,332
If you want to have sex with Van Halen,
do it on your own time.

38
00:01:43,457 --> 00:01:45,994
We are not the maybe-we-can-come-
see-you-play guys.

39
00:01:46,119 --> 00:01:49,273
We're the other guys,
the older guys who never showed up

40
00:01:49,398 --> 00:01:51,618
and whose approval they now crave.

41
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:54,822
- So we're their dads?
- Exactly.

42
00:01:57,878 --> 00:02:00,675
It's a big meeting,
so I don't think we're gonna make it.

43
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:02,246
Maybe next time, kiddos.

44
00:02:02,716 --> 00:02:05,458
If you want to meet us after your show,
maybe we could exchange numbers.

45
00:02:05,583 --> 00:02:06,926
Excuse us for a minute.

46
00:02:08,938 --> 00:02:12,631
Ted, have you gone completely insane?
We don't want their phone numbers.

47
00:02:12,903 --> 00:02:15,468
I don't know what I was doing.
I guess I panicked out there.

48
00:02:16,441 --> 00:02:18,584
When you exchange
numbers with a chick,

49
00:02:18,709 --> 00:02:21,234
you give them the ability
to call and cancel.

50
00:02:21,359 --> 00:02:24,518
If you set a date without a number,
they have to show up.

51
00:02:24,686 --> 00:02:26,470
Check and mate!

52
00:02:27,748 --> 00:02:29,909
The only digits I need are these.

53
00:02:31,849 --> 00:02:32,849
Honka.

54
00:02:33,948 --> 00:02:35,592
Are you still their dad?

55
00:02:37,816 --> 00:02:40,367
So, why don't we just meet here
tomorrow night around 10:00.

56
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:42,554
I think it's supposed to snow.

57
00:02:42,679 --> 00:02:45,912
- What do we do if there's a blizzard?
- Either way, we'll be here.

58
00:02:46,348 --> 00:02:47,725
"Snow" problem.

59
00:02:49,122 --> 00:02:51,059
Excuse us just one last second.

60
00:02:52,464 --> 00:02:54,006
What is the problem now?

61
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:56,657
- Nice one.
- Thanks.

62
00:02:58,468 --> 00:03:01,067
- We'll see you tomorrow night.
- Totally. Awesome!

63
00:03:02,039 --> 00:03:03,495
"Totally. Awesome!"

64
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:05,528
Man, these college chicks
sound stupid.

65
00:03:05,653 --> 00:03:07,518
- Totally.
- Awesome. So, here's the thing:

66
00:03:07,643 --> 00:03:11,452
tomorrow night, dress to move;
it's gonna be a mess!

67
00:03:12,057 --> 00:03:14,235
I still think we should've gotten
their numbers.

68
00:03:14,565 --> 00:03:17,043
You always assume
something is gonna go wrong.

69
00:03:17,168 --> 00:03:20,074
Ted, I promise you,
nothing is gonna go wrong.

70
00:03:21,850 --> 00:03:23,311
It's starting to snow.

71
00:03:35,465 --> 00:03:37,822
Synchro: ShalimarFox, Arrow

72
00:03:48,619 --> 00:03:51,136
<i>Kids,
the blizzard of '09 was a monster.</i>

73
00:03:51,331 --> 00:03:53,112
<i>It snowed for three days straight,</i>

74
00:03:53,313 --> 00:03:56,058
<i>which led to three amazing stories.</i>

75
00:03:56,337 --> 00:03:57,818
<i>I'll start with me and Barney.</i>

76
00:03:57,943 --> 00:04:00,405
It's pretty nasty out there.
I don't think they're coming.

77
00:04:00,530 --> 00:04:02,283
Of course they're coming.
They have to.

78
00:04:02,641 --> 00:04:05,744
If I can land just one of these girls,
I'll have party school bingo.

79
00:04:11,426 --> 00:04:13,252
Come on, Ted.
You're the only one here.

80
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:15,337
Sorry.
What's party school bingo?

81
00:04:16,465 --> 00:04:20,734
Every year, Playboy releases a list
of the top party schools in the country.

82
00:04:20,859 --> 00:04:23,035
I take the top 25, and I make up...

83
00:04:23,574 --> 00:04:24,718
a bingo card.

84
00:04:25,598 --> 00:04:27,766
All I need is Arizona Tech,

85
00:04:27,934 --> 00:04:29,185
which is crazy.

86
00:04:29,353 --> 00:04:32,566
In league play, that would
normally be designated a free space.

87
00:04:32,691 --> 00:04:35,316
So, how many people are
in on this party school bingo thing?

88
00:04:36,377 --> 00:04:37,621
It's just me.

89
00:04:37,944 --> 00:04:39,467
So what's the point, then?

90
00:04:39,592 --> 00:04:42,380
The point is to get five in a row.

91
00:04:43,742 --> 00:04:46,002
And what do you get
when you get five in a row?

92
00:04:48,452 --> 00:04:49,971
I get bingo.

93
00:04:52,324 --> 00:04:53,626
Thanks for coming by.

94
00:04:53,751 --> 00:04:56,021
I monkeyed around with
the thermostat for about an hour

95
00:04:56,146 --> 00:04:57,838
before I realized
it was the intercom.

96
00:04:58,277 --> 00:05:00,192
I heard you swearing downstairs.

97
00:05:00,442 --> 00:05:03,802
So, Lily's flight's coming in tonight,
you're really not gonna go pick her up?

98
00:05:06,854 --> 00:05:07,884
Like I said,

99
00:05:08,259 --> 00:05:11,101
as we mature,
our relationship matures with us.

100
00:05:11,742 --> 00:05:13,187
Yeah, if I know your wife,

101
00:05:13,355 --> 00:05:15,522
she's gonna get you
that six-pack anyway.

102
00:05:22,635 --> 00:05:23,781
Puget Stout.

103
00:05:24,195 --> 00:05:27,034
A most exquisite Seattle microbrew.

104
00:05:27,602 --> 00:05:29,411
And speaking of six-packs...

105
00:05:36,117 --> 00:05:38,479
- What are you doing?
- I'm going to the airport.

106
00:05:38,604 --> 00:05:41,674
How could I be so stupid?
Of course she's bringing me a six-pack!

107
00:05:41,842 --> 00:05:44,353
But this time,
I didn't bring him a six-pack.

108
00:05:44,929 --> 00:05:46,915
Because... as we mature,

109
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:49,118
the relationship matures with us.

110
00:05:50,098 --> 00:05:52,358
He sounds like a nice young man.

111
00:05:52,946 --> 00:05:55,896
I'll bet he surprises you
and picks you up anyway.

112
00:06:03,069 --> 00:06:06,073
- Where's my beer?
- We said we weren't gonna.

113
00:06:08,785 --> 00:06:09,878
I have beer.

114
00:06:10,708 --> 00:06:12,705
A six-pack and you're
an appropriate height for me.

115
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:14,894
Let's go, New Lily.

116
00:06:17,321 --> 00:06:21,005
- Man, I got to get some beer.
- <i>Folks, this is your captain speaking.</i>

117
00:06:21,173 --> 00:06:23,977
<i>Looks like we're going to be arriving
an hour early.</i>

118
00:06:26,553 --> 00:06:28,554
Drink up, boys.
I'm closing the bar.

119
00:06:29,170 --> 00:06:32,099
- It's only 9:00.
- And this place is ragin', yo!

120
00:06:34,103 --> 00:06:37,271
Guys, I'm really sorry, but I got to go
set up cots in the church basement.

121
00:06:37,396 --> 00:06:39,356
It doubles as a shelter
on snowy nights like this.

122
00:06:39,758 --> 00:06:40,910
You selfish bastard!

123
00:06:41,035 --> 00:06:43,444
There are two very hot girls
coming here to meet us.

124
00:06:43,612 --> 00:06:45,396
Can't you leave open
a little while longer?

125
00:06:45,521 --> 00:06:47,923
- We'll keep an eye on everything.
- You two? No way.

126
00:06:48,048 --> 00:06:50,127
You wouldn't know the first thing
about running a bar.

127
00:06:50,252 --> 00:06:51,829
Serve the hotties first?

128
00:06:52,621 --> 00:06:54,027
Here's the keys.

129
00:06:58,504 --> 00:06:59,789
Here's the keys.

130
00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:03,221
As soon as your girls show up,
you turn off the lights and you lock up.

131
00:07:03,346 --> 00:07:05,466
I don't want to come back
and find this place trashed.

132
00:07:05,916 --> 00:07:08,218
- Seriously?
- I can trust you guys.

133
00:07:08,386 --> 00:07:11,031
<i>To understand what it meant
to us to get the keys to MacLaren's, </i>

134
00:07:11,156 --> 00:07:12,900
<i>I have to take you back a few years</i>

135
00:07:13,025 --> 00:07:14,882
<i>to the night that
I uttered five little words</i>

136
00:07:15,007 --> 00:07:17,186
<i>that every man at some point
in his life will say.</i>

137
00:07:17,548 --> 00:07:21,106
- We should buy a bar.
- Of course, we should buy a bar!

138
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:22,775
We should totally buy a bar.

139
00:07:22,943 --> 00:07:25,611
- We should totally buy a bar.
- Our bar would be awesome.

140
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:28,364
And dude, dude, dude,

141
00:07:29,245 --> 00:07:30,346
dude...

142
00:07:31,497 --> 00:07:33,175
the name of our bar...

143
00:07:34,197 --> 00:07:35,219
Puzzles.

144
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:38,148
People will be like,
"Why is it called Puzzles?"

145
00:07:38,419 --> 00:07:39,922
That's the puzzle.

146
00:07:41,208 --> 00:07:42,864
That is...

147
00:07:43,932 --> 00:07:45,714
a great name for a bar!

148
00:07:46,434 --> 00:07:48,311
And also, at Puzzles:

149
00:07:48,657 --> 00:07:49,760
no last call.

150
00:07:49,928 --> 00:07:51,095
No last call!

151
00:07:51,263 --> 00:07:53,991
Only when every single person
is finished having the greatest night

152
00:07:54,116 --> 00:07:56,589
of his or her life do we stack
the chairs on the table

153
00:07:56,714 --> 00:07:58,894
and power down the three-story
margarita waterfall.

154
00:08:00,257 --> 00:08:02,439
- We should buy a bar.
- We should buy a bar.

155
00:08:03,154 --> 00:08:05,272
<i>Like the other
ill-advised five-word sentences </i>

156
00:08:05,397 --> 00:08:07,277
<i>every man eventually says
in his life...</i>

157
00:08:08,123 --> 00:08:09,988
I can jump that far.

158
00:08:10,614 --> 00:08:12,116
I'm gonna win her back.

159
00:08:12,803 --> 00:08:14,163
I can trust you guys.

160
00:08:14,288 --> 00:08:17,246
<i>... we would come to regret it.
We just didn't know it yet.</i>

161
00:08:43,422 --> 00:08:45,708
You have it?
Awesome! I'll be right there.

162
00:08:50,088 --> 00:08:51,748
I'm Rachel Sondheimer.

163
00:08:52,065 --> 00:08:53,490
Wait a minute, Lily.

164
00:08:53,658 --> 00:08:56,858
If you are getting off the plane,
where is Marshall?

165
00:08:57,131 --> 00:08:59,480
- And where is your six-pack?
- That's the problem.

166
00:08:59,605 --> 00:09:02,374
I have to get to Brewniverse
in East Meadow in an hour.

167
00:09:03,634 --> 00:09:05,594
- To the Town Car!
- Thank you.

168
00:09:06,894 --> 00:09:08,630
Barkeep. Triple Sec.

169
00:09:09,358 --> 00:09:11,017
Coming right up, tap-minder.

170
00:09:14,703 --> 00:09:15,888
We'll get one.

171
00:09:18,057 --> 00:09:19,467
- Order up.
- Order up.

172
00:09:23,427 --> 00:09:24,640
We'll get one.

173
00:09:24,765 --> 00:09:27,149
Thank God you're still here.

174
00:09:27,317 --> 00:09:30,194
I don't know if you guys have ever seen
<i>Star Wars</i>, but it's like Hoth out there.

175
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:31,509
Dibs.

176
00:09:31,634 --> 00:09:34,555
It reminds me of when
I used to go sledding with my dad...

177
00:09:34,755 --> 00:09:35,991
before he left.

178
00:09:36,159 --> 00:09:37,128
And dibs.

179
00:09:37,612 --> 00:09:39,411
So, can we warm you up with a drink?

180
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:43,165
Sure... by the way, I invited the rest
of the band to come and meet us.

181
00:09:43,608 --> 00:09:46,449
We were hoping to get drunk.
I mean really drunk.

182
00:09:46,574 --> 00:09:48,045
Like my dad used to.

183
00:09:48,436 --> 00:09:50,280
Dibsity, dibsity, dibsity.

184
00:09:51,144 --> 00:09:53,539
I guess we could keep
the place open a little bit longer.

185
00:09:53,664 --> 00:09:55,510
As long as
it's just you and the band.

186
00:09:58,495 --> 00:10:00,807
Melissa, what kind of band is this?

187
00:10:01,263 --> 00:10:03,977
We're the Arizona Tech
Fighting Hens Marching Band.

188
00:10:04,199 --> 00:10:05,507
Go, Hens!

189
00:10:06,139 --> 00:10:09,733
<i>And then, your Uncle Barney and I
had one of our telepathic conversations.</i>

190
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:12,326
<i>Dude, Carl's gonna kill us</i>

191
00:10:12,451 --> 00:10:14,840
<i>if we don't kick everyone
out of here right now.</i>

192
00:10:19,490 --> 00:10:22,621
<i>Barney, I'm serious. We promised
we wouldn't mess the place up.</i>

193
00:10:27,556 --> 00:10:29,415
<i>All right, I guess you have a point.</i>

194
00:10:30,366 --> 00:10:31,922
The bar is open!

195
00:10:33,931 --> 00:10:35,287
Who wants a beer?

196
00:10:38,877 --> 00:10:40,514
I still say this is stupid.

197
00:10:40,868 --> 00:10:44,183
What happened to, "As we mature,
the relationship matures with us"?

198
00:10:44,352 --> 00:10:47,813
That's just something Lily read
in Psychology Today.

199
00:10:49,310 --> 00:10:50,865
All right, she read it in Cosmo.

200
00:10:51,249 --> 00:10:52,782
All right, I read it in Cosmo.

201
00:10:53,123 --> 00:10:55,859
All right, it was Cosmo Girl.
Just drive, okay.

202
00:10:56,169 --> 00:10:57,714
I don't get why it's such a big deal

203
00:10:57,839 --> 00:10:59,873
that one little ritual
goes by the wayside.

204
00:10:59,998 --> 00:11:03,495
It's not just this, okay?
It's all our little rituals.

205
00:11:04,312 --> 00:11:07,311
Do you know what we used to do
every day the second I got home?

206
00:11:07,436 --> 00:11:10,586
Man, I don't want to hear
about your crazy monkey sex.

207
00:11:11,413 --> 00:11:14,131
We would tell each other
what we had to eat that day.

208
00:11:15,503 --> 00:11:17,689
Two eggs, a slice of cheese pizza

209
00:11:17,814 --> 00:11:19,136
and some steamed veggies.

210
00:11:19,628 --> 00:11:21,442
Everything bagel, chicken breast,

211
00:11:21,567 --> 00:11:24,080
some celery sticks
and a spoon of peanut butter.

212
00:11:25,692 --> 00:11:27,922
- Crazy monkey sex?
- Crazy monkey sex.

213
00:11:32,859 --> 00:11:33,818
TMI...

214
00:11:33,943 --> 00:11:35,543
too many informations.

215
00:11:36,078 --> 00:11:37,722
You know what else I miss?

216
00:11:37,881 --> 00:11:39,489
Our lunchtime phone call.

217
00:11:40,391 --> 00:11:42,783
Baby, it's lunchtime,
and I love you.

218
00:11:43,619 --> 00:11:45,370
I reciprocate in principle.

219
00:11:45,829 --> 00:11:47,539
Although with the caveat
that there seems

220
00:11:47,708 --> 00:11:49,625
to be a bit of a surplus here
on my end.

221
00:11:50,793 --> 00:11:53,273
No, I love you more.

222
00:11:54,074 --> 00:11:57,132
Do we need to get in a room together
and bang this thing out?

223
00:12:00,671 --> 00:12:02,638
Those sound like agreeable terms,

224
00:12:03,075 --> 00:12:05,663
although I may need
adjust my briefs.

225
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,245
Love you, too.

226
00:12:10,553 --> 00:12:12,563
But today when she called,

227
00:12:12,797 --> 00:12:15,444
I let it go to voice mail.
Voice mail!

228
00:12:15,569 --> 00:12:16,989
How could you?!

229
00:12:17,237 --> 00:12:20,072
The thing I miss most is kissing
at midnight on New Year's Eve.

230
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,157
It was a New Year's tradition.

231
00:12:22,634 --> 00:12:24,674
But you know what we did this year?

232
00:12:25,319 --> 00:12:27,371
- Crazy monkey sex?
- No.

233
00:12:31,133 --> 00:12:34,669
Okay, all these cute, adorable
little rituals... They're stupid.

234
00:12:35,159 --> 00:12:39,260
Telling each other what you had to eat?
You're like children playing house.

235
00:12:40,832 --> 00:12:43,532
Maybe you just think they're stupid
because you've never been

236
00:12:43,657 --> 00:12:45,889
in a relationship long enough
to develop them.

237
00:12:46,074 --> 00:12:48,449
- What?
- You don't understand love.

238
00:12:48,574 --> 00:12:52,180
Okay, you're like some robot
who sees a person crying and says...

239
00:12:52,565 --> 00:12:55,065
"Why is that human leaking?"

240
00:12:55,266 --> 00:12:56,389
Is that right?

241
00:12:57,014 --> 00:13:00,265
Well, then... Robot initiating
pull-over-to-the- side-of-the-road-

242
00:13:00,390 --> 00:13:03,411
until-jackass-apologizes-
to-me sequence.

243
00:13:09,977 --> 00:13:13,024
My robot was like,
a million times better.

244
00:13:17,633 --> 00:13:19,881
So you know, the trough
in the bathroom is overflowing.

245
00:13:20,484 --> 00:13:22,296
There's no trough in the bathroom.

246
00:13:22,963 --> 00:13:25,151
And you just came out
of the kitchen.

247
00:13:26,724 --> 00:13:29,283
What's in a gin and tonic?
What's in a gin and tonic?

248
00:13:30,110 --> 00:13:32,185
Running a bar sucks.
Let's just close up.

249
00:13:33,564 --> 00:13:34,809
There's no last call.

250
00:13:35,307 --> 00:13:36,565
Puzzles, go for Barney.

251
00:13:36,733 --> 00:13:39,335
Good. You're still there.
I'll be there in five.

252
00:13:40,602 --> 00:13:41,635
Last call.

253
00:13:47,992 --> 00:13:50,215
There's a snowplow coming.
We have to get back on the road.

254
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:53,207
You think the only way to be
in love is to have pet names.

255
00:13:53,339 --> 00:13:55,426
Or leave each other stupid,
little notes

256
00:13:55,551 --> 00:13:59,129
or go charging off into a blizzard
for no good reason.

257
00:13:59,298 --> 00:14:01,131
Do you understand
what's going to happen?

258
00:14:01,299 --> 00:14:03,407
You know what you are?
You're a love snob.

259
00:14:03,532 --> 00:14:05,469
There's lots of ways
to be in a relationship,

260
00:14:05,638 --> 00:14:08,638
you would know that if you ever left
your little love snob country club.

261
00:14:08,806 --> 00:14:11,433
We're going to get buried by snow.
That's going to happen.

262
00:14:11,656 --> 00:14:14,869
No, screw this. I'm not going
to sit here and be insulted.

263
00:14:15,410 --> 00:14:18,143
We're not going to the airport.
We're going home.

264
00:14:21,343 --> 00:14:22,676
What just happened?

265
00:14:28,958 --> 00:14:31,203
We called earlier
about the Seattle microbrew.

266
00:14:31,407 --> 00:14:34,956
Good thing you called when you did.
I was getting ready to close up.

267
00:14:35,284 --> 00:14:37,334
Storm of the century out there.

268
00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:40,597
Of course, it's only '09,
so storm of the century might be

269
00:14:40,722 --> 00:14:42,339
a little bit premature.

270
00:14:42,536 --> 00:14:44,410
Let's say storm of the year.

271
00:14:44,535 --> 00:14:46,468
Although, it is only January.

272
00:14:46,637 --> 00:14:49,763
We're in kind of a hurry,
so, we'll take the beer now.

273
00:14:50,707 --> 00:14:51,973
You are a cute couple.

274
00:14:52,163 --> 00:14:53,808
- Thank you.
- We're not a couple.

275
00:14:54,037 --> 00:14:55,977
Thank God.
That would be weird.

276
00:14:59,316 --> 00:15:00,664
Here she is.

277
00:15:00,789 --> 00:15:02,150
"Supersonic Tonic."

278
00:15:02,789 --> 00:15:05,487
No. This is a keg.
I need a six-pack.

279
00:15:05,828 --> 00:15:07,916
- A keg's all I got.
- We'll take the keg.

280
00:15:08,041 --> 00:15:11,284
What? Oh, no.
Last time I had one of these in the car,

281
00:15:11,605 --> 00:15:14,669
I wound up chipping dried vomit
off the seat

282
00:15:14,794 --> 00:15:15,956
with a putty knife.

283
00:15:16,125 --> 00:15:18,293
I'm sorry, Ranjit,
but this is a ritual

284
00:15:18,418 --> 00:15:20,001
and I am bringing him this beer.

285
00:15:22,213 --> 00:15:24,289
If you could just put it in the car.

286
00:15:25,354 --> 00:15:27,071
I'll give you 50 bucks.

287
00:15:27,196 --> 00:15:28,413
To the Town Car.

288
00:15:34,446 --> 00:15:37,060
Robin, I'm sorry.
You're not a robot.

289
00:15:38,669 --> 00:15:41,487
If you are, you're,
like, an incredibly advanced model,

290
00:15:41,612 --> 00:15:43,525
and the human race
doesn't stand a chance.

291
00:15:44,988 --> 00:15:47,167
You just don't choose
to show your love

292
00:15:47,292 --> 00:15:49,320
through corny rituals,
and that's fine.

293
00:15:49,851 --> 00:15:52,676
But maybe the reason Lily and I do
is because we always have,

294
00:15:52,801 --> 00:15:54,707
and we don't know any other way.

295
00:15:55,552 --> 00:15:57,115
One thing I do know is that

296
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:59,573
if she's there sitting
at the airport alone,

297
00:16:00,618 --> 00:16:02,168
I have to go get her.

298
00:16:02,821 --> 00:16:04,211
Those are the rules.

299
00:16:06,435 --> 00:16:07,799
Marshall, close your eyes.

300
00:16:09,153 --> 00:16:12,262
I don't know how you heard
any of that as me hitting on you, but...

301
00:16:12,430 --> 00:16:13,430
Just do it.

302
00:16:21,832 --> 00:16:23,578
Now let's go get your woman.

303
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:26,613
All right, come on.

304
00:16:26,945 --> 00:16:29,445
You don't have to go home,
but you can't stay here.

305
00:16:30,102 --> 00:16:31,615
I've always wanted to say that.

306
00:16:31,784 --> 00:16:34,458
I mean, in a bar.
I say it all the time at home.

307
00:16:35,703 --> 00:16:38,079
Dude, someday we should buy a bar.

308
00:16:38,248 --> 00:16:41,137
And when we do,
we are never going to have last call.

309
00:16:42,972 --> 00:16:46,838
Come on, Barney. We said no last call.
We've got to mean it.

310
00:16:47,288 --> 00:16:50,091
Well, what are we supposed to do?
Carl's going to be here any minute.

311
00:16:51,045 --> 00:16:52,427
Only one thing we can do.

312
00:16:55,568 --> 00:16:58,068
Dude, running a bar
is a pain in the ass.

313
00:16:58,193 --> 00:17:00,602
We should just stick
with what we know.

314
00:17:01,943 --> 00:17:04,648
- We should start a band.
- Of course we should start a band!

315
00:17:05,009 --> 00:17:06,940
How have we not started a band yet?

316
00:17:09,123 --> 00:17:12,003
<i>Kids, sometimes in life
the planets align,</i>

317
00:17:12,284 --> 00:17:13,782
<i>everything links up,</i>

318
00:17:13,950 --> 00:17:15,808
<i>and your timing is perfect.</i>

319
00:17:37,122 --> 00:17:39,366
<i>This wasn't one of those times.</i>

320
00:17:41,944 --> 00:17:43,026
Where is she?

321
00:17:43,646 --> 00:17:44,646
Seattle.

322
00:17:45,210 --> 00:17:46,823
- What?
- Her flight's canceled.

323
00:17:46,948 --> 00:17:48,149
It never took off.

324
00:17:48,506 --> 00:17:50,481
She would've called me and...

325
00:17:55,241 --> 00:17:56,570
Baby, it's me.

326
00:17:56,695 --> 00:17:59,321
My flight's been canceled
because of some snowstorm

327
00:17:59,446 --> 00:18:01,245
and they couldn't rebook me
till Thursday,

328
00:18:01,825 --> 00:18:03,998
<i>so I'm stuck here
for another two days.</i>

329
00:18:04,635 --> 00:18:07,292
<i>But it's lunchtime, and I love you.</i>

330
00:18:09,045 --> 00:18:11,464
<i>Like I said,
this was a three-day storm.</i>

331
00:18:12,139 --> 00:18:14,152
- <i>Tuesday.</i>
- I still say this is stupid.

332
00:18:14,692 --> 00:18:15,826
Wednesday.

333
00:18:17,627 --> 00:18:19,222
- <i>And Thursday.</i>
- ... microbrew.

334
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:21,766
<i>So on Tuesday when Marshall
heard that message...</i>

335
00:18:22,185 --> 00:18:23,893
She's not coming in till Thursday.

336
00:18:24,541 --> 00:18:27,641
I mean, we came all the way down here,
and she's not coming in till Thursday.

337
00:18:27,766 --> 00:18:28,766
I feel so stupid.

338
00:18:30,407 --> 00:18:32,944
Look, let's just, let's not tell Lily
about any of this, okay?

339
00:18:33,892 --> 00:18:35,969
Especially the part
about you hitting on me.

340
00:18:36,094 --> 00:18:37,631
I didn't hit on you.

341
00:18:38,082 --> 00:18:39,082
Exactly.

342
00:18:40,643 --> 00:18:41,894
<i>Then on Wednesday...</i>

343
00:18:42,019 --> 00:18:44,372
Man, I can't believe you drove
all the way out there.

344
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:47,333
Now you're gonna turn around and drive
all the way out there again tomorrow.

345
00:18:49,082 --> 00:18:52,148
This whole thing was a sign, you know?
It's time to put that old ritual to bed.

346
00:18:52,273 --> 00:18:54,064
I'm not going to pick her up.

347
00:18:54,189 --> 00:18:55,550
Robin really hit on you?

348
00:18:56,286 --> 00:18:57,094
Dude,

349
00:18:57,835 --> 00:18:58,762
it was weird.

350
00:18:59,638 --> 00:19:00,561
Bros,

351
00:19:00,686 --> 00:19:02,766
this party is awesome!

352
00:19:03,221 --> 00:19:05,014
You are true friends
of the Fighting Hens.

353
00:19:05,139 --> 00:19:08,188
If you ever need anything,
don't hesitate to ask.

354
00:19:08,762 --> 00:19:10,564
Is the flute section seeing anyone?

355
00:19:13,903 --> 00:19:16,154
So, wait, you're really
not going to pick her up?

356
00:19:16,279 --> 00:19:18,407
- Really.
- So the New Year's kiss,

357
00:19:18,532 --> 00:19:21,235
the lunchtime phone calls,
the whole

358
00:19:21,770 --> 00:19:24,829
"this is what I ate today" thing,
you're really letting it all go?

359
00:19:27,028 --> 00:19:28,070
I really am.

360
00:19:28,807 --> 00:19:30,743
<i>Which brings us to Thursday.</i>

361
00:20:11,705 --> 00:20:14,162
A muffin, a pastrami sandwich,

362
00:20:14,287 --> 00:20:15,414
and a bag of chips.

363
00:20:15,539 --> 00:20:18,466
And I know it's way past
lunchtime, but I love you.

364
00:20:18,853 --> 00:20:21,285
More and more each day,
I love you, Lily.

365
00:20:22,530 --> 00:20:23,638
Happy New Year.

366
00:20:30,337 --> 00:20:32,939
Wait, does this mean that I have
to bring a marching band to the airport

367
00:20:33,108 --> 00:20:34,524
- from now on?
- Absolutely.

368
00:20:34,693 --> 00:20:35,693
Crap.

369
00:20:47,455 --> 00:20:48,584
Go, Hens!

370
00:20:50,223 --> 00:20:51,223
Puzzles.

371
00:20:51,784 --> 00:20:54,252
That is a great band name.

372
00:20:56,911 --> 00:20:58,506
Have you seen Amanda?

373
00:20:59,376 --> 00:21:00,472
Bingo!
