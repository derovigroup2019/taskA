1
00:00:01,419 --> 00:00:04,786
I can't believe Metro News 1 is just
forwarding you all this fan mail now.

2
00:00:04,889 --> 00:00:08,757
- I know. I quit, like, four months ago.
- Wow, you had more fans than I thought.

3
00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:12,057
And only about 60% of them
are prison inmates.

4
00:00:12,163 --> 00:00:14,062
What are these guys thinking?

5
00:00:14,164 --> 00:00:16,462
I am way past my dating prisoners phase.

6
00:00:16,566 --> 00:00:19,296
It's like, hello,
I'm not 19 anymore, you know?

7
00:00:21,171 --> 00:00:22,195
Lottery girl's on.

8
00:00:22,305 --> 00:00:26,605
I just feel sorry for these women.
This is where broadcast careers go to die.

9
00:00:26,710 --> 00:00:30,168
Check it out. I make it fun.
I invented a little game.

10
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:32,944
<i>Tonight's lotto numbers are...</i>

11
00:00:35,352 --> 00:00:36,613
<i>...nineteen...</i>

12
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:37,811
Age you moved to New York

13
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:39,945
after a photographer "discovered" you
at a food court

14
00:00:40,055 --> 00:00:41,784
<i>and said he'd get you in Vogue magazine.</i>

15
00:00:41,891 --> 00:00:42,949
<i>Fifty-three...</i>

16
00:00:43,058 --> 00:00:44,582
Number of semi-nude pictures
he took of you

17
00:00:44,693 --> 00:00:48,094
<i>before you realized he had no connection
to Vogue magazine.</i>

18
00:00:48,197 --> 00:00:51,098
<i>- Twenty-two...
- Age you claim you are.</i>

19
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:54,260
<i>- Thirty-one...
- Age you actually are.</i>

20
00:00:54,370 --> 00:00:55,462
<i>Forty-five.</i>

21
00:00:55,571 --> 00:00:57,835
Number of minutes it would
take me to get you into a cab,

22
00:00:57,940 --> 00:01:02,706
<i>- out of your dress, and into my Jacuzzi.
- And the super big ball is...</i>

23
00:01:02,810 --> 00:01:05,335
What happens after
we get out of the Jacuzzi.

24
00:01:05,446 --> 00:01:06,777
What up?

25
00:01:21,362 --> 00:01:25,525
<i>Kids, by the winter of 2009,
Robin had been unemployed for months.</i>

26
00:01:25,632 --> 00:01:27,293
<i>But there was a glimmer of hope.</i>

27
00:01:27,401 --> 00:01:29,596
- Hey!
- Hey, how'd the audition go?

28
00:01:29,703 --> 00:01:32,171
Well, I went in there feeling really good.

29
00:01:32,272 --> 00:01:34,763
I heard it was just me
up against two other girls.

30
00:01:34,875 --> 00:01:36,365
Listening.

31
00:01:43,150 --> 00:01:44,811
- Hi.
- Hi.

32
00:01:44,918 --> 00:01:46,646
Robin Scherbatsky.

33
00:01:48,187 --> 00:01:49,211
And you are?

34
00:01:51,057 --> 00:01:53,355
You've obviously
never spent any time in Denver.

35
00:01:53,459 --> 00:01:55,689
Rochelle Harper, News Center 12.

36
00:01:55,795 --> 00:02:00,425
We were only the number one station
in the Rockies for five straight years.

37
00:02:00,533 --> 00:02:03,229
I was an anchor here in town
at Metro News 1.

38
00:02:03,336 --> 00:02:08,638
Ooh, an anchor.
You must have a killer signoff phrase.

39
00:02:08,741 --> 00:02:11,504
- I'm sorry?
- You gotta have a killer signoff phrase.

40
00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:16,070
Like Walter Cronkite.
"And that's the way it is. "

41
00:02:16,181 --> 00:02:17,978
So what's yours?

42
00:02:18,083 --> 00:02:20,574
Well, I would just always end
with a simple

43
00:02:20,685 --> 00:02:24,416
"From all of us here at Metro News 1,
have a good evening. "

44
00:02:28,460 --> 00:02:32,419
Mine is "From all of us here
at Barney's apartment, get out. "

45
00:02:33,931 --> 00:02:37,560
You didn't let those reporter bitches
psych you out, did you?

46
00:02:38,168 --> 00:02:42,571
And the President's economic team is
hoping to have a proposal before Congress

47
00:02:42,673 --> 00:02:44,231
by the end of the month.

48
00:02:44,341 --> 00:02:47,902
From all of us here at News 10,
have a good evening.

49
00:02:51,949 --> 00:02:53,917
So, good night, New York.

50
00:02:54,018 --> 00:02:58,215
And may the road ahead
be lit with dreams and tomorrows.

51
00:02:59,489 --> 00:03:02,652
Which are lit with dreams, also.

52
00:03:03,726 --> 00:03:08,493
Wow. That's terrible. And bad, also.

53
00:03:09,666 --> 00:03:10,690
I wasn't done.

54
00:03:12,135 --> 00:03:16,799
Stand tall, New York.
Trustworthy. Recycling.

55
00:03:18,608 --> 00:03:20,268
Wear a condom.

56
00:03:21,710 --> 00:03:23,473
Wear a condom?

57
00:03:24,279 --> 00:03:26,873
I'm not gonna be
the new Channel 10 anchor, am I?

58
00:03:26,982 --> 00:03:28,916
This just in. No.

59
00:03:30,819 --> 00:03:33,049
Maybe the problem is your resum?.

60
00:03:33,155 --> 00:03:36,647
See how mine is lean and mean?
Yours is too cluttered.

61
00:03:36,758 --> 00:03:39,318
Like everything on your resum?
is so relevant.

62
00:03:39,428 --> 00:03:43,329
"Program Director,
88.1 Wesleyan University Radio?"

63
00:03:43,431 --> 00:03:47,731
- Oh, God.
- Dr. X? You're still bragging about Dr. X?

64
00:03:47,835 --> 00:03:50,201
- Who was Dr. X?
- Nobody knows.

65
00:03:50,304 --> 00:03:53,467
- He was this genius mystery DJ.
- It was Ted.

66
00:03:53,574 --> 00:03:56,941
- His identity remains a secret to this day.
- It was Ted.

67
00:03:57,044 --> 00:04:00,138
But this phantom of the airwaves
changed the very face of college radio.

68
00:04:00,247 --> 00:04:02,738
- It was Ted.
- And your show sucked.

69
00:04:03,117 --> 00:04:07,849
<i>Dr. X here, shooting truth bullets
at you from an undisclosed location.</i>

70
00:04:07,954 --> 00:04:11,014
<i>Because if they knew where I was,
they'd shut me down.</i>

71
00:04:11,124 --> 00:04:15,288
You're on the third floor of the Student
Center next to the game room, you tool.

72
00:04:15,395 --> 00:04:17,420
<i>I've been getting a lot of letters
about my segment</i>

73
00:04:17,530 --> 00:04:20,192
<i>on how racist the school's meal plan is.</i>

74
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:23,360
How are you getting letters
if no one knows where you are, douche?

75
00:04:23,470 --> 00:04:26,303
<i>That's why I'm organizing a happening
outside the dining hall,</i>

76
00:04:26,406 --> 00:04:27,600
<i>Monday at midnight.</i>

77
00:04:27,707 --> 00:04:30,106
<i>It's high time
the food service puppet masters</i>

78
00:04:30,209 --> 00:04:33,178
<i>took ignorance and injustice off the menu.</i>

79
00:04:33,812 --> 00:04:35,973
<i>Hey, Ted,
we need a fourth for foosball.</i>

80
00:04:36,081 --> 00:04:37,844
<i>What are you doing in here, anyway?</i>

81
00:04:37,950 --> 00:04:40,817
<i>Dude, get out of here!
I'll be there in a second.</i>

82
00:04:40,919 --> 00:04:43,513
<i>So, remember, dining hall,
Monday, midnight.</i>

83
00:04:43,622 --> 00:04:45,988
<i>Another Dr. X happening.</i>

84
00:04:46,091 --> 00:04:50,255
<i>I'll be there,
because X marks the spot-ot-ot-ot.</i>

85
00:04:51,263 --> 00:04:55,221
If you think people liked your show,
they did not-ot-ot-ot.

86
00:04:55,333 --> 00:04:57,324
This is weird. Look what got mixed in

87
00:04:57,435 --> 00:04:58,959
- with your fan mail.
- What?

88
00:04:59,070 --> 00:05:02,096
It's from the U.S. Department
of Immigration.

89
00:05:03,307 --> 00:05:05,639
It's postmarked two months ago.

90
00:05:10,815 --> 00:05:12,544
- Oh, boy.
- What is it?

91
00:05:12,650 --> 00:05:14,242
It's about my work visa.

92
00:05:14,352 --> 00:05:18,811
Unless I can find a job
in the next seven days,

93
00:05:18,922 --> 00:05:21,550
they're gonna send me back to Canada.

94
00:05:28,865 --> 00:05:30,765
I can't believe
you might be kicked out of the country.

95
00:05:30,867 --> 00:05:33,495
I know. My whole life is here.

96
00:05:33,603 --> 00:05:36,731
No. We won't let this happen.
I mean, one of us will help you find a job.

97
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:39,172
Yeah, I bet I can get you
something at my school.

98
00:05:39,275 --> 00:05:41,869
No, guys. It doesn't work that way.

99
00:05:41,977 --> 00:05:45,879
Robin only gets her work visa
if she gets a job in her field.

100
00:05:45,981 --> 00:05:50,008
I mean, you know what? I guess you
could stay if you married a U.S. citizen.

101
00:05:50,119 --> 00:05:52,383
Yeah, that could work.

102
00:05:52,488 --> 00:05:56,720
No, no. They could never process that and
make it official in time. That won't work.

103
00:05:56,826 --> 00:06:00,762
I'm screwed. I've been sending out
my reel for three months, and nothing.

104
00:06:00,863 --> 00:06:03,831
Well, maybe there's something in your reel
that people aren't responding to.

105
00:06:03,932 --> 00:06:05,559
Let's take a look at it, right?

106
00:06:08,903 --> 00:06:10,234
<i>That's a good question, Norm.</i>

107
00:06:10,338 --> 00:06:15,503
Okay, the first thing is from when I was
a cub reporter for Channel 22 in Red Deer.

108
00:06:15,610 --> 00:06:18,272
In Alberta. In Canada.

109
00:06:18,913 --> 00:06:20,005
Ooh.

110
00:06:20,148 --> 00:06:21,706
- Canada.
- Right.

111
00:06:21,816 --> 00:06:24,046
<i>Well, the snow's coming down pretty hard,</i>

112
00:06:24,152 --> 00:06:27,382
<i>but these intrepid fishermen are
still happy to be out competing,</i>

113
00:06:27,487 --> 00:06:32,982
<i>in Lake Athabasca's Bass
Fishing Jamboree, an August 1st tradition.</i>

114
00:06:33,093 --> 00:06:34,822
<i>Back to you, Norm.</i>

115
00:06:37,965 --> 00:06:41,696
What? That was my first job.
It shows where I came from.

116
00:06:41,802 --> 00:06:44,032
Unless a bear attacks you
in the next three seconds

117
00:06:44,137 --> 00:06:47,664
and you snap its neck with your legs,
that has no business being on your reel.

118
00:06:47,774 --> 00:06:50,606
No, no, I get it, I get it.

119
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:52,871
Where you're from
is part of who you're selling.

120
00:06:52,979 --> 00:06:55,209
For instance,
under Special Skills on my resum?,

121
00:06:55,314 --> 00:06:57,179
I mention that back in Minnesota,

122
00:06:57,283 --> 00:06:59,717
I was the 1995 Nicollet County
Slam Dunk Champion.

123
00:06:59,819 --> 00:07:02,310
You put dunk champion on your resum??

124
00:07:02,421 --> 00:07:05,948
Yeah, why wouldn't you?
A lot of companies have basketball teams.

125
00:07:06,058 --> 00:07:07,548
It's good for them to know

126
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:10,390
that Vanilla Thunder
can still take the rock to the hole.

127
00:07:10,496 --> 00:07:14,397
- They called you Vanilla Thunder?
- Yeah, Vanilla Thunder.

128
00:07:14,499 --> 00:07:16,990
The Ghost in the Post.
The Human Turnstile.

129
00:07:17,102 --> 00:07:19,866
I didn't play that much D.

130
00:07:19,971 --> 00:07:23,236
- You can't still dunk.
- Of course I can.

131
00:07:23,341 --> 00:07:27,505
- Well, I mean, I could, until recently.
- Until the injury.

132
00:07:28,213 --> 00:07:31,910
- It's called iliopsoas tendonitis.
- Yikes. That sounds bad.

133
00:07:32,017 --> 00:07:34,781
It's more commonly known
as dancer's hip.

134
00:07:38,822 --> 00:07:40,380
Dr. Goodman...

135
00:07:41,892 --> 00:07:45,123
Oh, come on! lliopsoas tendonitis.

136
00:07:45,229 --> 00:07:47,993
That's what it's called.
That's all it's called.

137
00:07:48,732 --> 00:07:50,632
Iliopsoas tendonitis.

138
00:07:50,734 --> 00:07:53,760
It's a basketball injury.
You know, it's no big whoop.

139
00:07:53,871 --> 00:07:56,271
Dancer's hip, Marshall has
something called dancer's hip.

140
00:07:56,373 --> 00:07:57,635
Okay, no, no, okay.

141
00:07:57,741 --> 00:08:02,404
They only call it that, look, because
it's very common with ballet dancers.

142
00:08:04,247 --> 00:08:08,741
So, tell me, do any of the other little girls
in your class have dancer's hip?

143
00:08:08,851 --> 00:08:09,818
Yeah, sure.

144
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:11,318
- I have more of a technical question.
- Yes?

145
00:08:11,421 --> 00:08:14,879
Is it easier to dance
when you don't have external genitalia?

146
00:08:14,991 --> 00:08:17,585
Good, don't build to that,
just go right for it.

147
00:08:17,694 --> 00:08:20,925
Guys, come on.
Marshall didn't get this injury from dancing.

148
00:08:21,030 --> 00:08:22,428
Thank you, Lily.

149
00:08:22,531 --> 00:08:27,833
Clearly, the stirrups were set a little
too wide during his last trip to the gyno.

150
00:08:27,936 --> 00:08:32,236
Guys, guys, I hate to cut you off
before Marshall bursts into tears,

151
00:08:32,341 --> 00:08:38,507
but, Robin, check this out. What you need
is an awesome video resum?.

152
00:08:38,613 --> 00:08:42,913
Like mine. I present

153
00:08:43,018 --> 00:08:46,282
barneysvideoresume. com.

154
00:09:02,470 --> 00:09:04,335
Oh! Hello.

155
00:09:04,438 --> 00:09:05,735
<i>Barney Stinson,</i>

156
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:08,274
<i>you've achieved great success in business,</i>

157
00:09:08,376 --> 00:09:13,540
<i>athletics and personal relationships and
have been an inspiration to many people.</i>

158
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:17,782
Is that you? Are you interviewing yourself?

159
00:09:17,884 --> 00:09:21,411
How can it be me? That guy's British.

160
00:09:21,521 --> 00:09:24,649
<i>What would you recommend
to your numerous admirers</i>

161
00:09:24,758 --> 00:09:27,124
<i>who want to reach their highest potential?</i>

162
00:09:27,227 --> 00:09:29,559
And a wee bit Scottish.

163
00:09:30,697 --> 00:09:34,655
The first thing you need to know about
success is that it doesn't just come to you.

164
00:09:35,167 --> 00:09:40,799
Most people associate success with money
and power, but really, it's a state of mind.

165
00:09:43,308 --> 00:09:46,402
You had to be on a motorcycle to say that?

166
00:09:46,512 --> 00:09:50,972
And when it comes to success,
the only limit is that there are no limits.

167
00:09:51,383 --> 00:09:54,580
Hey, I didn't know you knew how to
stand near a horse, that's impressive.

168
00:09:54,686 --> 00:09:57,848
Barney, I don't get it. You don't do
a damn thing in any of these clips.

169
00:09:57,955 --> 00:10:00,685
Exactly. Because that's who
Corporate America wants,

170
00:10:00,792 --> 00:10:05,422
people who seem like bold risk takers,
but never actually do anything.

171
00:10:05,530 --> 00:10:08,226
Actually doing things gets you fired.

172
00:10:08,332 --> 00:10:11,392
In fact, I'm writing a book
on this very phenomenon.

173
00:10:11,502 --> 00:10:12,594
Really, you're writing a book?

174
00:10:12,703 --> 00:10:16,195
No, that would be doing...
Are you even listening?

175
00:10:16,974 --> 00:10:22,036
All my life, I have dared
to go past what is possible.

176
00:10:22,145 --> 00:10:24,477
<i>To the impossible?</i>

177
00:10:24,581 --> 00:10:26,708
Actually, past that,

178
00:10:26,817 --> 00:10:32,915
to the place where the possible
and the impossible meet to become

179
00:10:33,023 --> 00:10:34,718
the possimpible.

180
00:10:35,759 --> 00:10:37,556
The possimpible? Really?

181
00:10:37,661 --> 00:10:41,290
Inventing your own word
shows creativity and vision.

182
00:10:41,398 --> 00:10:43,058
Visativity.

183
00:10:44,967 --> 00:10:49,165
If I can leave you with one thought,
it's this,

184
00:10:49,271 --> 00:10:53,901
nothing and everything is possimpible.

185
00:10:54,310 --> 00:10:57,245
<i>Barney Stinson, Barney Stinson</i>

186
00:10:57,346 --> 00:10:59,075
<i>That guy's awesome</i>

187
00:10:59,181 --> 00:11:03,140
Is that you again?
Are you singing a song about yourself?

188
00:11:03,252 --> 00:11:06,015
Absolutely not. That would be lame.

189
00:11:07,021 --> 00:11:11,458
<i>Stinson, Barney Stinson
singing this song</i>

190
00:11:11,559 --> 00:11:13,186
<i>That would be really lame</i>

191
00:11:13,294 --> 00:11:16,821
<i>One of the many admirers
who think that guy's awesome</i>

192
00:11:17,599 --> 00:11:19,863
<i>Perfect and available</i>

193
00:11:19,968 --> 00:11:22,801
<i>Awesome, awesome, awesome
awesome, awesome, awesome</i>

194
00:11:23,972 --> 00:11:25,564
<i>Awesome! Awesome!</i>

195
00:11:25,673 --> 00:11:28,665
<i>Awesome, awesome, awesome
awesome, awesome, awesome</i>

196
00:11:28,775 --> 00:11:30,333
<i>Awesome!</i>

197
00:11:40,721 --> 00:11:43,281
That baby got me 11 job offers.

198
00:11:43,390 --> 00:11:45,119
- No. No way.
- Yeah.

199
00:11:45,225 --> 00:11:49,423
- Barney, that was ridiculous and insane.
- Insane-ulous.

200
00:11:50,898 --> 00:11:52,262
- Make me one.
- What?

201
00:11:52,365 --> 00:11:54,299
- Yes, now you're talking.
- What?

202
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:57,062
I'm about to be deported. I'll try anything.

203
00:11:57,170 --> 00:11:59,331
Okay, we better get started.
There's a lot to shoot,

204
00:11:59,438 --> 00:12:01,998
and I don't think I can use any
of the footage I already have of you.

205
00:12:02,108 --> 00:12:04,941
What footage do you already have of me?

206
00:12:05,044 --> 00:12:07,035
Let's just get started.

207
00:12:08,881 --> 00:12:13,784
Sweetie, are you still upset
about the dancer's hip jokes?

208
00:12:13,886 --> 00:12:15,409
No.

209
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:18,683
We were just kidding.
We all know it's a basketball injury.

210
00:12:18,790 --> 00:12:20,519
Yeah, no, totally.

211
00:12:23,495 --> 00:12:27,329
- Lily, I have something I need to tell you.
- What is it?

212
00:12:28,533 --> 00:12:30,694
I dance more than you know.

213
00:12:32,103 --> 00:12:37,302
- What?
- I dance, more than you know.

214
00:12:40,044 --> 00:12:42,604
I don't know how to respond to that.

215
00:12:43,314 --> 00:12:48,183
So, Robin, what does
being a reporter mean to you?

216
00:12:49,186 --> 00:12:52,155
- Well, ever since I was a little kid...
- Cut!

217
00:12:53,023 --> 00:12:55,150
Robin, you're getting bogged down
in specifics.

218
00:12:55,259 --> 00:12:59,628
I need you to just say vague,
confident-sounding buzzwords,

219
00:12:59,730 --> 00:13:05,099
like synergy and dynamism.
You can make up a word, like linkativity.

220
00:13:05,201 --> 00:13:08,500
How will sounding like an idiot
get me hired anywhere?

221
00:13:08,605 --> 00:13:10,630
Okay, fine. Don't do it.

222
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:13,971
Anyway, I'm sure there are plenty of
exciting stories to cover back in Canada.

223
00:13:14,077 --> 00:13:17,274
I just read that the mayor of Winnipeg's
nephew went ice fishing

224
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:19,507
and caught himself a 16-pound walleye.

225
00:13:19,616 --> 00:13:24,110
"Reporting live from the worst place
in the world, I'm Robin Scherbatsky. "

226
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:26,346
Okay, fine. Roll camera.

227
00:13:29,791 --> 00:13:32,521
- Connectitude.
- Love it.

228
00:13:32,628 --> 00:13:35,153
- Transformatation.
- Earn it!

229
00:13:35,264 --> 00:13:36,788
Linkativity!

230
00:13:37,566 --> 00:13:39,591
Yeah, linkativity's mine.

231
00:13:42,704 --> 00:13:45,468
So, how much dancing
are we talking about?

232
00:13:45,574 --> 00:13:49,976
I don't... I guess I'd say medium.

233
00:13:51,245 --> 00:13:54,271
Why are you dancing so much,
and why don't I know about it?

234
00:13:54,382 --> 00:13:57,715
It's something I do when I'm alone.
You know, like if something good happens,

235
00:13:57,818 --> 00:13:59,809
I get excited and I need to move,
and I just...

236
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:03,913
I don't know. I don't want to
even talk about this anymore.

237
00:14:04,025 --> 00:14:06,619
So that's how you injured your hip?

238
00:14:08,229 --> 00:14:12,892
Hey, did you hear? They're giving us
a half day today. We can leave at 2:00.

239
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,431
Great! Thanks, Herm.

240
00:14:24,544 --> 00:14:27,445
Barney, these costumes are ridiculous.

241
00:14:27,547 --> 00:14:31,210
Plus, the Amazon warrior princess armor
gave me a rash.

242
00:14:31,318 --> 00:14:34,378
Cards on the table, you weren't
the first lady to wear that in here.

243
00:14:34,487 --> 00:14:38,582
But it conveyed power. And so will this.
What I need you to do now

244
00:14:38,691 --> 00:14:40,716
is break these 15 bricks
with your forehead.

245
00:14:40,826 --> 00:14:43,590
What? But you didn't do a damn thing
in your video.

246
00:14:43,696 --> 00:14:46,824
You just stood near a horse
and sat on a motorcycle.

247
00:14:46,932 --> 00:14:49,560
That's because I'm a man.
You're a woman.

248
00:14:49,668 --> 00:14:51,636
The assumption
is that you can't do anything.

249
00:14:51,737 --> 00:14:56,834
- But you have to prove society wrong.
- I can't break 15 bricks with my forehead.

250
00:14:57,776 --> 00:15:01,370
Robin, it's not 1950 anymore. Yes, you can.

251
00:15:02,547 --> 00:15:04,378
- I'm out of here.
- What? Why?

252
00:15:04,482 --> 00:15:09,249
None of this is going to help me get a job.
I'm about to get kicked out of the country.

253
00:15:10,488 --> 00:15:11,682
I know what I have to do.

254
00:15:15,293 --> 00:15:17,488
Is this where the lottery girl auditions are?

255
00:15:17,595 --> 00:15:19,324
Yeah, right here.

256
00:15:24,401 --> 00:15:27,165
<i>So, kids, your Aunt Robin
had reached her low point.</i>

257
00:15:27,270 --> 00:15:29,932
<i>She was auditioning to be the lottery girl.</i>

258
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:33,203
- And tonight's lotto numbers are...
- Hold it.

259
00:15:33,310 --> 00:15:35,107
Say the line before you press the button.

260
00:15:35,212 --> 00:15:37,737
- It builds the suspense.
- It builds the suspense.

261
00:15:37,848 --> 00:15:38,974
Okay.

262
00:15:40,550 --> 00:15:43,075
And tonight's lotto numbers are...

263
00:15:46,655 --> 00:15:48,179
- Seventeen...
- Stop her.

264
00:15:48,290 --> 00:15:51,259
- Hold it.
- Why did she say it like that?

265
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:55,057
It's like she's not even happy
about the 17 coming up.

266
00:15:55,164 --> 00:15:58,224
- She seems mean.
- Yeah, she seems super-mean.

267
00:15:58,934 --> 00:16:01,903
Can you take another run at 17 for us?

268
00:16:03,172 --> 00:16:04,196
Seventeen.

269
00:16:04,306 --> 00:16:07,537
Okay, I don't even understand
what she's doing.

270
00:16:08,410 --> 00:16:10,344
- Let me try something.
- All right.

271
00:16:10,445 --> 00:16:12,777
Try being a little more wry.

272
00:16:13,915 --> 00:16:16,383
Wry? About the number 17?

273
00:16:16,484 --> 00:16:19,317
- Wry, with a little bit of a...
- Twinkle.

274
00:16:19,421 --> 00:16:20,820
...twinkle.

275
00:16:21,556 --> 00:16:23,046
Seventeen.

276
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:26,551
That was great!

277
00:16:27,862 --> 00:16:29,022
Hey, Marsh, I got you a light beer.

278
00:16:29,130 --> 00:16:32,257
I know how you dancers
are always counting calories.

279
00:16:32,366 --> 00:16:33,390
It's not funny, all right?

280
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:36,162
The doctor says if it gets any worse,
I might need surgery.

281
00:16:36,270 --> 00:16:38,670
Vaginal rejuvenation surgery?

282
00:16:38,772 --> 00:16:41,639
You know who didn't do a lot
of operating on vaginas in college?

283
00:16:41,742 --> 00:16:42,936
- Who?
- Dr. X.

284
00:16:43,043 --> 00:16:45,273
- He did just fine!
- You know what?

285
00:16:45,379 --> 00:16:49,816
Both of you geniuses need to take
that weak-ass crap off your resum?s.

286
00:16:49,917 --> 00:16:54,616
I mean, you are not Dr. X anymore,
and you cannot dunk anymore.

287
00:16:54,721 --> 00:16:55,744
Let it go.

288
00:16:55,855 --> 00:16:57,846
So Marshall and I
are the only people at this table

289
00:16:57,957 --> 00:17:00,289
with weak-ass crap on their resum?s?

290
00:17:00,393 --> 00:17:02,327
What are you implying?

291
00:17:02,695 --> 00:17:04,686
Oh. Oh, wow. I don't know!

292
00:17:04,797 --> 00:17:08,858
Does the date July 4th, 1995
mean anything to you?

293
00:17:08,968 --> 00:17:10,731
You son of a bitch.

294
00:17:15,374 --> 00:17:21,175
Time! And the new champion, with
29 hot dogs, Lily "The Belly" Aldrin!

295
00:17:27,419 --> 00:17:29,979
How is that relevant
to teaching kindergarten?

296
00:17:30,088 --> 00:17:35,390
It teaches kids that
I can eat a lot of hot dogs very quickly.

297
00:17:35,494 --> 00:17:39,794
- Yeah, but you can't do it anymore!
- You can't dunk anymore, lady-hips!

298
00:17:39,898 --> 00:17:43,162
- How dare you! These hips can...
- Guys, guys!

299
00:17:44,168 --> 00:17:47,660
I didn't even get the lotto girl gig.

300
00:17:47,771 --> 00:17:50,069
I have to move back to Canada.

301
00:17:51,442 --> 00:17:53,342
I can't believe this.

302
00:17:55,312 --> 00:17:57,872
I remember the night
before I moved down here.

303
00:17:57,982 --> 00:18:00,280
They threw a going-away party for me.

304
00:18:00,384 --> 00:18:04,548
They gave me a camera so I could
take pictures and send them home.

305
00:18:05,655 --> 00:18:09,523
And everyone was so sure
I was gonna be such a big success.

306
00:18:11,861 --> 00:18:13,761
I'm really gonna miss you guys.

307
00:18:16,833 --> 00:18:20,860
- What happened?
- Robin has to move back to Canada.

308
00:18:20,970 --> 00:18:22,870
Oh, my God. How awful.

309
00:18:23,873 --> 00:18:26,535
I mean, for one thing,
it's gonna be a really long commute.

310
00:18:26,643 --> 00:18:28,132
What do you mean?

311
00:18:28,243 --> 00:18:30,143
I finished your video resum? on my own,

312
00:18:30,245 --> 00:18:32,509
messenger-ed it
to every station in the city.

313
00:18:32,614 --> 00:18:35,742
A guy from Channel 8 called. He loved you.

314
00:18:35,851 --> 00:18:38,513
- He wanted you to come in and audition.
- Oh, my God!

315
00:18:38,620 --> 00:18:41,953
I told him no.
Robin Scherbatsky doesn't audition.

316
00:18:42,057 --> 00:18:45,254
- He gives you the job or nothing.
- So I got the job?

317
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:47,828
No. He cursed me out and hung up.

318
00:18:48,764 --> 00:18:52,756
But then Channel 12 called.
They also loved you.

319
00:18:52,867 --> 00:18:56,633
They offered you a job
hosting their new morning talk show.

320
00:18:56,737 --> 00:18:57,931
Barney, that's amazing!

321
00:18:58,039 --> 00:18:59,666
- I told them to shove it.
- Dude!

322
00:18:59,774 --> 00:19:02,538
Which only made them want you more.

323
00:19:02,643 --> 00:19:06,636
So, they jacked up their offer by 10%.
Congratulations, Miss Scherbatsky.

324
00:19:06,747 --> 00:19:09,215
It looks like you're gonna have to stay.

325
00:19:16,189 --> 00:19:20,023
- You're not about to dance, are you?
- No, I'm good. I'll do it later.

326
00:19:21,628 --> 00:19:24,927
Oh, my God. How did you pull this off?

327
00:19:25,031 --> 00:19:30,401
- I am the master of the possimpible.
- You really are. Thank you.

328
00:19:33,139 --> 00:19:34,231
<i>So,
thanks to your Uncle Barney,</i>

329
00:19:34,341 --> 00:19:36,275
<i>we got to keep your Aunt Robin.</i>

330
00:19:37,444 --> 00:19:39,468
<i>There's so much stuff in my life</i>

331
00:19:39,912 --> 00:19:42,244
<i>No room for me to grow</i>

332
00:19:46,051 --> 00:19:49,248
<i>And the rest of us decided
it was time to let some things go.</i>

333
00:19:54,393 --> 00:19:56,327
<i>Well, except for Lily.</i>

334
00:19:56,762 --> 00:20:01,131
- And time!
- What's the count?

335
00:20:01,566 --> 00:20:03,227
Thirty-three!

336
00:20:05,336 --> 00:20:07,861
<i>Under the waterfall</i>

337
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:11,802
<i>Under the waterfall</i>

338
00:20:12,510 --> 00:20:15,638
<i>It's cool and cold and clear</i>

339
00:20:36,199 --> 00:20:38,963
Why is no one coming to my happenings?
