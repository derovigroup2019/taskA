1
00:00:02,558 --> 00:00:05,521
Kids, there is something
I wish my dad told me.

2
00:00:05,762 --> 00:00:08,692
The longest pause
you will ever experience in your life

3
00:00:08,812 --> 00:00:10,906
is the one that follows
asking the question...

4
00:00:11,026 --> 00:00:12,311
Will you marry me?

5
00:00:13,221 --> 00:00:16,815
Your brain goes into overdrive,
imaging every possible response.

6
00:00:17,835 --> 00:00:18,734
No.

7
00:00:19,473 --> 00:00:20,694
Oh, God, no.

8
00:00:24,198 --> 00:00:25,977
You want me to marry...

9
00:00:26,568 --> 00:00:27,407
No.

10
00:00:28,443 --> 00:00:30,584
Oh, I'm sorry, Ted. I can't.

11
00:00:30,824 --> 00:00:31,618
Mark Johnson,

12
00:00:31,738 --> 00:00:34,713
the quarterback from your high school
football team, already asked me.

13
00:00:34,833 --> 00:00:36,092
What's up, Turd?

14
00:00:36,786 --> 00:00:37,864
It's Ted!

15
00:00:39,206 --> 00:00:40,364
But if you're lucky,

16
00:00:40,484 --> 00:00:44,076
she may answer with the single
greatest word in the English language.

17
00:00:44,586 --> 00:00:45,397
Yes.

18
00:00:46,995 --> 00:00:49,495
Sync by vNaru

19
00:01:00,605 --> 00:01:03,231
Stella and I spent that summer
happily engaged.

20
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:06,115
Marshall was still coping
with unemployment.

21
00:01:06,235 --> 00:01:07,407
What are you doing?

22
00:01:09,569 --> 00:01:11,508
Lily threw herself
into her painting.

23
00:01:11,738 --> 00:01:13,070
What are you doing?

24
00:01:14,358 --> 00:01:16,878
Barney was rehabilitating
from his bus accident.

25
00:01:16,998 --> 00:01:18,460
What are you doing?

26
00:01:19,764 --> 00:01:22,788
And well, Marshall just kept coping
with unemployment.

27
00:01:26,062 --> 00:01:27,441
What are you doing?

28
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:33,100
And Robin continued to uphold the high
journalistic standards of Metro News 1.

29
00:01:33,709 --> 00:01:38,635
Is your favorite brand of dental floss
poisoning your entire family?

30
00:01:38,922 --> 00:01:41,295
Tune in at 11:00 for the shocking...

31
00:01:42,025 --> 00:01:42,907
Tooth.

32
00:01:45,784 --> 00:01:47,864
Okay, I officially hate my job.

33
00:01:48,196 --> 00:01:52,121
I'm not a reporter, I'm just someone who
shows up at night and scares people.

34
00:01:52,353 --> 00:01:54,560
I'm the bogeyman
with a teleprompter.

35
00:01:57,625 --> 00:01:59,667
"Bogeyman with a teleprompter."

36
00:01:59,787 --> 00:02:02,534
That's hilarious!
Great joke, Robin, great joke.

37
00:02:02,798 --> 00:02:05,757
Barney, no offense to Robin,
but that wasn't that funny.

38
00:02:05,917 --> 00:02:08,369
Are you kidding?
That was a great joke.

39
00:02:08,489 --> 00:02:11,020
It's smart, funny, beautiful,
the whole package.

40
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:13,579
It's everything you're afraid
to let yourself want.

41
00:02:14,222 --> 00:02:15,382
In a joke.

42
00:02:17,835 --> 00:02:19,956
"Bogeyman with a teleprompter."

43
00:02:21,010 --> 00:02:21,865
Classic.

44
00:02:24,003 --> 00:02:27,542
Okay, what is so urgent
that you called me and begged me

45
00:02:27,662 --> 00:02:30,273
to come over at 7:22 in the morning?

46
00:02:30,393 --> 00:02:33,799
I could tell you knew something
was up with me, and you're right.

47
00:02:34,098 --> 00:02:37,055
But I can't tell you what it is.
I should tell you, but I can't!

48
00:02:37,175 --> 00:02:40,641
I have to. I never will! I'm going to.
Let's just drop it. What's up with you?

49
00:02:41,528 --> 00:02:42,794
Barney, just say it.

50
00:02:46,245 --> 00:02:47,883
I think I'm in love with Robin.

51
00:02:48,902 --> 00:02:51,912
Hey, Lily needs some gift ideas
for Stella's wedding shower.

52
00:02:52,032 --> 00:02:53,530
Does she like to cook?

53
00:02:55,027 --> 00:02:56,567
Actually, I don't know.

54
00:02:56,864 --> 00:02:58,542
What's her favorite color?

55
00:02:59,593 --> 00:03:01,117
Don't know that either.

56
00:03:01,487 --> 00:03:03,847
- Well, does she have any hobbies?
- Yes.

57
00:03:03,967 --> 00:03:06,526
She's exactly the kind of person
who would have hobbies.

58
00:03:06,804 --> 00:03:08,302
And interests, too.

59
00:03:08,859 --> 00:03:10,543
I am one lucky son of a bitch.

60
00:03:10,663 --> 00:03:11,525
Dude,

61
00:03:11,645 --> 00:03:14,076
you don't know anything
about the woman you're marrying.

62
00:03:14,236 --> 00:03:15,129
What?

63
00:03:15,249 --> 00:03:16,745
You're crazy! I know plenty.

64
00:03:17,016 --> 00:03:18,448
What color are her eyes?

65
00:03:19,622 --> 00:03:22,084
The color of the ocean
after a storm.

66
00:03:22,244 --> 00:03:23,335
Which is?

67
00:03:26,164 --> 00:03:27,118
Beautiful.

68
00:03:28,833 --> 00:03:30,046
I don't believe it.

69
00:03:30,166 --> 00:03:33,271
I thought you called me over here
to uncuff you from your sex swing again,

70
00:03:33,391 --> 00:03:35,001
but you're in love?

71
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:36,848
That is so sweet!

72
00:03:37,008 --> 00:03:38,321
It's not "sweet."

73
00:03:38,441 --> 00:03:40,352
It's like a disease.

74
00:03:40,512 --> 00:03:43,271
I slept with Robin one time
and I caught feelings.

75
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:45,065
I caught feelings bad.

76
00:03:45,397 --> 00:03:47,253
I used protection and everything.

77
00:03:48,254 --> 00:03:51,821
Barney, you don't "catch" feelings,
you just have them.

78
00:03:52,125 --> 00:03:54,446
- And they're good.
- They're terrible!

79
00:03:54,724 --> 00:03:56,832
I can't eat, I can't sleep.

80
00:03:57,177 --> 00:04:00,014
She's all I think about.
I close my eyes, I see Robin.

81
00:04:00,134 --> 00:04:02,374
I, I hear a song;
It reminds me of Robin.

82
00:04:02,534 --> 00:04:03,309
Morning.

83
00:04:03,429 --> 00:04:06,163
I sleep with that chick,
I'm thinking about Robin.

84
00:04:07,136 --> 00:04:10,006
Okay, so I don't know
every single detail about Stella.

85
00:04:10,275 --> 00:04:12,389
What's really about?
Do you not like her or something?

86
00:04:12,509 --> 00:04:15,554
No, Ted, I like Stella lot.
She's a Mets fan.

87
00:04:15,714 --> 00:04:16,433
Really?

88
00:04:16,553 --> 00:04:18,941
It's just that everything with you
has moved so fast.

89
00:04:19,061 --> 00:04:20,916
You've only known
each other a few months.

90
00:04:21,036 --> 00:04:23,370
Don't you think maybe you should
slow things down a little bit?

91
00:04:23,490 --> 00:04:25,667
- Get to know each other better?
- I'll have a whole life

92
00:04:25,787 --> 00:04:27,377
time to get to know her better.

93
00:04:27,497 --> 00:04:30,318
Right now,
I know the one thing that I have to:

94
00:04:31,128 --> 00:04:32,181
that I love her.

95
00:04:32,301 --> 00:04:33,597
You love her?

96
00:04:33,884 --> 00:04:36,005
Barney, how can you be in love,

97
00:04:36,125 --> 00:04:38,410
and still be sleeping
with anything that moves?

98
00:04:39,647 --> 00:04:41,490
I'm sorry, I don't follow you.

99
00:04:41,768 --> 00:04:43,200
That's like saying,

100
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:45,971
"How can an ant carry
"20 times its body weight,

101
00:04:46,091 --> 00:04:48,073
but root beer floats
are still delicious?"

102
00:04:48,193 --> 00:04:49,671
Are the two even related?

103
00:04:49,831 --> 00:04:50,792
Really?

104
00:04:51,123 --> 00:04:53,469
Barney, you're going to have
to stop screwing around

105
00:04:53,589 --> 00:04:55,285
if you want to be Robin's boyfriend.

106
00:04:57,704 --> 00:04:58,700
"Boyfriend"?

107
00:04:58,820 --> 00:05:00,891
I don't want to be
Robin's boyfriend.

108
00:05:01,302 --> 00:05:02,934
Well, what do you want, then?

109
00:05:03,094 --> 00:05:05,437
I don't know.
I just want to be with her.

110
00:05:05,924 --> 00:05:07,013
All the time.

111
00:05:07,371 --> 00:05:10,238
I want to hear about her day
and tell her about mine.

112
00:05:10,583 --> 00:05:13,445
I want to hold her hand
and smell her hair.

113
00:05:14,766 --> 00:05:16,948
But I don't want to be
her stupid boyfriend.

114
00:05:17,766 --> 00:05:19,678
Barney, what you just described

115
00:05:19,957 --> 00:05:23,328
is a relationship between
a boyfriend and a girlfriend.

116
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:25,624
And a pretty clingy one at that.

117
00:05:26,182 --> 00:05:28,863
Look, Lily, are you going to help me out
with this or not?

118
00:05:28,983 --> 00:05:30,873
I'm a kindergarten teacher.

119
00:05:30,993 --> 00:05:34,696
I see a confused, little kid in the
corner trying to eat the lefty scissors,

120
00:05:34,816 --> 00:05:36,853
I gotta help the poor,
little bastard.

121
00:05:37,122 --> 00:05:39,538
But only if you stop
sleeping around.

122
00:05:39,774 --> 00:05:40,584
Deal?

123
00:05:41,765 --> 00:05:42,641
Deal.

124
00:05:42,801 --> 00:05:43,869
Coming up next,

125
00:05:43,989 --> 00:05:48,489
is your local ice cream man actually
driving a roving meth lab on wheels?

126
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:50,719
Stay tuned for the full...

127
00:05:52,267 --> 00:05:53,170
Scoop.

128
00:05:53,290 --> 00:05:54,305
Really?

129
00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:03,226
I know dudes think it's girlie
for a guy to cook, but us ladies?

130
00:06:03,731 --> 00:06:06,123
- We find it mighty sexy.
- Really?

131
00:06:06,483 --> 00:06:07,416
You know...

132
00:06:08,102 --> 00:06:09,629
My grandma taught me how.

133
00:06:09,749 --> 00:06:11,527
- Oh, yeah, she did.
- Yeah.

134
00:06:11,647 --> 00:06:14,756
I had a lot of time after school
to watch her cook because

135
00:06:15,023 --> 00:06:16,341
I wasn't good at sports.

136
00:06:17,233 --> 00:06:18,719
I'm on fire right now.

137
00:06:23,703 --> 00:06:25,267
Delicious. What's in this pesto?

138
00:06:25,534 --> 00:06:28,450
Oh, you know, the usual:
Basil, garlic, olive oil,

139
00:06:28,570 --> 00:06:30,689
but can you guess
my secret ingredient?

140
00:06:31,049 --> 00:06:31,965
Peanuts.

141
00:06:32,264 --> 00:06:33,777
Yes. How did you know that?

142
00:06:40,843 --> 00:06:43,348
- OK, let's my think, what else?
- You know what, sweetie?

143
00:06:43,508 --> 00:06:46,194
I woke up so early
and I had a really long day at work.

144
00:06:46,314 --> 00:06:48,826
And there was that whole thing
where you tried to kill me.

145
00:06:48,946 --> 00:06:50,406
Can we please just go to sleep?

146
00:06:50,526 --> 00:06:53,087
No, I clearly need
to know more about you.

147
00:06:53,372 --> 00:06:55,276
Let's do firsts. First kiss?

148
00:06:55,957 --> 00:06:57,552
Dale Harris, second grade.

149
00:06:57,819 --> 00:07:00,990
You're talking like peck on the cheek
or a full-on passionate making out?

150
00:07:01,150 --> 00:07:04,026
- Passionate making out.
- OK, yeah, Dale Harris, second grade.

151
00:07:04,398 --> 00:07:05,793
First time you had sex.

152
00:07:05,913 --> 00:07:07,750
- Dale Harris, second...
- Stop it.

153
00:07:07,870 --> 00:07:09,916
Billy Devito,
sophomore year of college.

154
00:07:10,076 --> 00:07:10,942
Prude.

155
00:07:11,208 --> 00:07:13,387
Molly McKenzie,
junior year of high school.

156
00:07:13,507 --> 00:07:14,357
Slut.

157
00:07:15,294 --> 00:07:17,465
Robin just needs
to see this new see of you.

158
00:07:17,779 --> 00:07:19,801
- So just call her up?
- Just call her up.

159
00:07:22,585 --> 00:07:23,409
It's...

160
00:07:25,555 --> 00:07:26,512
Hi, Robin.

161
00:07:28,594 --> 00:07:30,937
She wasn't there.
I left a voice mail.

162
00:07:31,097 --> 00:07:33,131
You left a voice,
but it wasn't male.

163
00:07:33,933 --> 00:07:35,227
Barney, I don't get it.

164
00:07:35,347 --> 00:07:37,726
You've called a million girls
a million times.

165
00:07:37,846 --> 00:07:39,486
Yeah,
but those were just booty calls.

166
00:07:39,606 --> 00:07:41,823
On a booty call,
you barely even have to talk.

167
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:45,119
Around 9:00 p.m., you say...
Hey, baby, it's Barney.

168
00:07:45,239 --> 00:07:47,052
You busy tonight? Sweet.

169
00:07:47,172 --> 00:07:49,328
See you in half an hour? Can't wait.

170
00:07:49,824 --> 00:07:52,310
But the later it gets,
the fewer words you need.

171
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:54,198
Barney. Busy? Sweet.

172
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:57,247
And by 3:00 in the morning...

173
00:08:02,985 --> 00:08:03,868
Sweet.

174
00:08:05,187 --> 00:08:06,516
A question mark?

175
00:08:06,636 --> 00:08:08,683
You got laid off a question mark?

176
00:08:11,905 --> 00:08:14,605
It's no worse
than your super-obvious code words.

177
00:08:16,252 --> 00:08:18,205
- Rhinoceros.
- We have to go.

178
00:08:19,706 --> 00:08:21,487
Great. Now we need a new code word.

179
00:08:23,035 --> 00:08:25,666
Ah, ah, it's her, it's Robin.
What do I do?

180
00:08:25,898 --> 00:08:27,744
No-no-no-no, aah!
Robin...

181
00:08:28,037 --> 00:08:29,738
Great to hear from you.

182
00:08:29,858 --> 00:08:31,956
To what do I owe the pleasure?

183
00:08:32,243 --> 00:08:35,027
You called, went, and hung up.

184
00:08:35,147 --> 00:08:36,276
What do you want?

185
00:08:36,396 --> 00:08:37,503
Help me!

186
00:08:38,192 --> 00:08:39,946
Just ask her something.

187
00:08:41,295 --> 00:08:43,217
How are you feeling today?

188
00:08:43,691 --> 00:08:44,634
Fine.

189
00:08:44,754 --> 00:08:46,242
Something personal.

190
00:08:48,149 --> 00:08:50,933
At what age
did you first get your period?

191
00:08:51,928 --> 00:08:53,686
Did you just ask me
about about my period?

192
00:08:53,846 --> 00:08:55,230
No, I did not.

193
00:08:56,804 --> 00:08:58,493
Look, Barney, I'm at work right now.

194
00:08:58,613 --> 00:09:00,200
Just ask her out.

195
00:09:01,914 --> 00:09:04,232
Robin, I was wondering if...

196
00:09:06,692 --> 00:09:08,242
Nothing. Gotta go. Bye.

197
00:09:10,704 --> 00:09:12,484
That was just a practical joke.

198
00:09:12,604 --> 00:09:14,405
I'm not really in love with Robin.

199
00:09:14,525 --> 00:09:16,567
You should've seen
the look on your face.

200
00:09:16,687 --> 00:09:19,274
There's cameras right there
and there and there.

201
00:09:20,737 --> 00:09:24,550
What a legendary prank that
we're never going to speak of again.

202
00:09:30,252 --> 00:09:31,076
Gross.

203
00:09:34,034 --> 00:09:36,688
- First movie you ever saw.
- Benji, 1981.

204
00:09:37,932 --> 00:09:40,565
I watched it recently
with Lucy and I just thought,

205
00:09:40,685 --> 00:09:43,277
"Oh, that dog is so dead right now."

206
00:09:44,592 --> 00:09:45,608
What about you?

207
00:09:45,728 --> 00:09:48,658
My dad took me to an old drive-in
to see the original Star Wars.

208
00:09:49,246 --> 00:09:51,452
You know,
I've actually never seen Star Wars.

209
00:09:51,612 --> 00:09:53,913
She's never seen Star Wars?!

210
00:09:54,073 --> 00:09:55,721
Ted, the only people in the universe

211
00:09:55,841 --> 00:09:58,066
who haven't seen Star Wars
are the characters,

212
00:09:58,186 --> 00:09:59,787
and that's 'cause they lived them.

213
00:09:59,907 --> 00:10:03,063
- That's 'cause they lived the Star Wars.
- You've got to calm down.

214
00:10:03,194 --> 00:10:05,918
I told you. You didn't know
this girl well enough. What if...

215
00:10:06,365 --> 00:10:09,532
- you show it to her, she doesn't like it?
- Dude, it's just a movie.

216
00:10:09,913 --> 00:10:12,188
Star Wars is your all-time
favorite movie,

217
00:10:12,308 --> 00:10:14,613
and whether or not Stella likes
it is actually important.

218
00:10:14,733 --> 00:10:17,144
It's like, it's a test
of how compatible you guys are.

219
00:10:18,310 --> 00:10:19,436
It's just a movie.

220
00:10:19,599 --> 00:10:21,316
It's just a movie!

221
00:10:21,515 --> 00:10:25,291
<i>121 awesome minutes later</i>

222
00:10:26,297 --> 00:10:27,888
If Stella doesn't like this movie,

223
00:10:28,008 --> 00:10:29,732
- I can't marry her.
- You can't.

224
00:10:30,229 --> 00:10:32,319
- You want to watch it again?
- I do.

225
00:10:39,892 --> 00:10:42,082
Wait... Where are the boys?
I thought this was a group thing.

226
00:10:42,202 --> 00:10:44,945
I lied. They're not coming
and I'm about to leave.

227
00:10:45,065 --> 00:10:46,024
Why?

228
00:10:46,144 --> 00:10:46,990
Because...

229
00:10:47,150 --> 00:10:49,701
they're not in love with Robin,
and neither am I.

230
00:10:50,278 --> 00:10:52,240
I mean, she's great and sweet.

231
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:55,081
I'm not going to pretend
that I haven't noticed her body,

232
00:10:55,201 --> 00:10:57,458
but this is off topic.
Good luck.

233
00:10:57,618 --> 00:10:59,217
Wait, wait, I can't do this.

234
00:10:59,337 --> 00:11:01,368
She'll never take me seriously.
She thinks I'm some

235
00:11:01,539 --> 00:11:02,755
womanizing idiot.

236
00:11:03,268 --> 00:11:05,286
We both know
you're more than that.

237
00:11:05,836 --> 00:11:08,195
How Robin the Barney
I met the other day.

238
00:11:08,724 --> 00:11:11,406
You mean the insecure,
touchy-feely she-male

239
00:11:11,526 --> 00:11:13,602
who sounded alarmingly close to Ted?

240
00:11:14,293 --> 00:11:16,078
Ted hit that for over a year.

241
00:11:17,226 --> 00:11:18,271
Wish me luck.

242
00:11:19,648 --> 00:11:21,869
I just thought it'd be fun
to watch a movie tonight,

243
00:11:21,989 --> 00:11:25,049
and since you've never seen Star Wars,
I figured why not?

244
00:11:25,415 --> 00:11:26,460
No big deal.

245
00:11:26,941 --> 00:11:28,139
It's pretty good.

246
00:11:28,515 --> 00:11:30,033
Sounds like a plan.

247
00:11:35,590 --> 00:11:37,536
I'm just grab a beer.
You want one?

248
00:11:37,656 --> 00:11:39,650
The movie's already started, so...

249
00:11:40,161 --> 00:11:43,129
It's some words flying through space.
I'm not going to read that anyway.

250
00:11:43,289 --> 00:11:44,255
Oh, my God.

251
00:11:44,415 --> 00:11:45,870
Off to a bad start.

252
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:48,472
What are you doing down there?

253
00:11:48,592 --> 00:11:51,045
I'm making sure my best friend
is marrying the right woman.

254
00:11:51,165 --> 00:11:52,471
That's what I'm doing.

255
00:11:52,591 --> 00:11:54,565
What are you doing,
hiding behind the couch?

256
00:11:54,685 --> 00:11:55,934
You need to get a job.

257
00:11:58,002 --> 00:11:59,376
I really do, don't I?

258
00:12:01,433 --> 00:12:02,554
So, Robin...

259
00:12:03,499 --> 00:12:04,859
tell me about your day,

260
00:12:05,186 --> 00:12:08,533
and not just what happened,
how you felt about what happened.

261
00:12:09,667 --> 00:12:12,102
- What?
- I'm not looking to problem-solve,

262
00:12:12,222 --> 00:12:13,785
I'm just looking to listen.

263
00:12:15,629 --> 00:12:17,871
- Why are you acting like this?
- Like what?

264
00:12:18,665 --> 00:12:20,423
You're being super nice. It's...

265
00:12:20,543 --> 00:12:22,340
freaking me out. Be...

266
00:12:23,030 --> 00:12:25,401
gross, be inappropriate.
Be Barney.

267
00:12:25,832 --> 00:12:27,095
I'm being Barney,

268
00:12:27,848 --> 00:12:30,349
and I think tonight's going to be

269
00:12:30,469 --> 00:12:32,452
de... wait for it... lightful.

270
00:12:33,883 --> 00:12:34,883
Delightful.

271
00:12:35,758 --> 00:12:36,758
Right.

272
00:12:40,558 --> 00:12:42,730
So I went
to the chiropractor yesterday.

273
00:12:42,890 --> 00:12:46,192
That guy bent me over the table
and pounded me for a good hour.

274
00:12:49,232 --> 00:12:51,768
Is insurance going to cover that?
Sometimes they don't.

275
00:12:52,429 --> 00:12:53,474
That's it?

276
00:12:57,370 --> 00:12:59,050
Today I was at the dentist.

277
00:12:59,296 --> 00:13:01,353
That guy drilled me

278
00:13:01,857 --> 00:13:03,184
all day long.

279
00:13:04,036 --> 00:13:05,503
He drilled me hard.

280
00:13:06,456 --> 00:13:08,230
He filled all of my cavities.

281
00:13:08,732 --> 00:13:09,841
Come on, man.

282
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:13,076
- Your teeth look fantastic.
- Who are you?

283
00:13:21,495 --> 00:13:22,495
What?

284
00:13:23,533 --> 00:13:24,533
Nothing.

285
00:13:25,701 --> 00:13:27,215
You were staring at me.

286
00:13:28,785 --> 00:13:30,581
You look really beautiful tonight.

287
00:13:32,394 --> 00:13:34,708
You don't look
so bad yourself, mister.

288
00:13:35,096 --> 00:13:36,693
Great scene, great scene.

289
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:41,054
Star Wars fun fact number seven...

290
00:13:41,214 --> 00:13:42,990
George Lucas based
the film's structure

291
00:13:43,110 --> 00:13:45,308
on Akira Kurosawa's
The Hidden Fortress.

292
00:13:45,790 --> 00:13:48,478
He also owes a debt to Campbell's work
with comparative mythology.

293
00:13:48,638 --> 00:13:50,710
Yeah, Ted,
I'm losing wood over here.

294
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:52,088
What's going on?

295
00:13:52,370 --> 00:13:53,370
Nothing.

296
00:13:54,842 --> 00:13:55,854
Wait, it's

297
00:13:56,124 --> 00:13:58,780
really important to you
that I like this movie, isn't it?

298
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:05,161
I'm not gonna like it with you
staring at me the whole time.

299
00:14:05,455 --> 00:14:07,852
Go to your room
and I will come get you when it's over.

300
00:14:07,972 --> 00:14:08,972
Go.

301
00:14:16,031 --> 00:14:17,534
Should I leave, too?

302
00:14:18,462 --> 00:14:20,012
What part, what part?

303
00:14:28,053 --> 00:14:29,086
Thanks.

304
00:14:30,279 --> 00:14:31,279
Nothing?

305
00:14:31,523 --> 00:14:32,850
Not even a glance?

306
00:14:33,101 --> 00:14:36,659
Even I was thinking about rocking
a motorboat on those bad boys.

307
00:14:36,985 --> 00:14:38,612
What the hell is wrong with you?

308
00:14:39,613 --> 00:14:42,894
I don't always want to be that guy.
Sometimes I want to be someone

309
00:14:43,014 --> 00:14:44,910
you can have
an actual conversation with.

310
00:14:46,112 --> 00:14:49,085
Now, tell me something about you
that I don't know yet.

311
00:14:49,766 --> 00:14:50,624
Seriously.

312
00:14:55,667 --> 00:14:57,732
There's a job opening
at a new cable network

313
00:14:57,852 --> 00:14:59,758
that would be perfect for me...

314
00:15:00,649 --> 00:15:04,336
completely legit world news, interviews
with people who matter...

315
00:15:05,982 --> 00:15:08,474
- but I decided I'm not going to apply.
- Why not?

316
00:15:08,842 --> 00:15:10,079
Because I'm a joke.

317
00:15:10,345 --> 00:15:13,313
I'm just the scary news lady
from some stupid local news channel.

318
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:16,108
We both know you're more than that.

319
00:15:17,435 --> 00:15:18,860
Promise me you'll apply.

320
00:15:20,199 --> 00:15:22,948
- It's not as easy...
- Promise me you'll apply.

321
00:15:26,701 --> 00:15:27,711
I promise.

322
00:15:30,685 --> 00:15:33,139
She's up to the scene
where Luke, Leia, Han and Chewy escape

323
00:15:33,259 --> 00:15:35,806
- from the Death Star's trash compactor.
- Great scene.

324
00:15:36,429 --> 00:15:37,546
Greatscene?

325
00:15:40,323 --> 00:15:42,319
Okay, we should have just heard...

326
00:15:46,887 --> 00:15:49,474
but Stella didn't make a peep.
I'm gonna take a look.

327
00:15:58,803 --> 00:16:00,818
She's not even watching.
She's texting.

328
00:16:01,409 --> 00:16:04,196
- I'll tell her you still want to be friends.
- I don't believe this.

329
00:16:04,464 --> 00:16:07,737
I believe, she knows this is important
to me. She's blatantly...

330
00:16:11,029 --> 00:16:13,081
"Stop watching me, jackasses."

331
00:16:14,755 --> 00:16:17,103
- To taking chances.
- To taking chances.

332
00:16:20,499 --> 00:16:23,944
You know, Robin, there's actually something,
I do want to talk to you about.

333
00:16:24,377 --> 00:16:26,328
- Last call.
- Of course it is.

334
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,680
- One more for the road?
- Yeah, why not?

335
00:16:29,233 --> 00:16:30,407
Hold that thought?

336
00:16:33,209 --> 00:16:34,209
I will.

337
00:16:42,878 --> 00:16:44,392
- I loved it.
- Yes!

338
00:16:45,308 --> 00:16:48,013
I am marrying a woman
who is not only hot

339
00:16:48,133 --> 00:16:50,369
but loves Star Wars.
That's the dream.

340
00:16:52,693 --> 00:16:55,427
- What was that?
- I was high-fiving 15-Year-Old Me

341
00:16:55,547 --> 00:16:57,577
through the space-time continuum.
We did it.

342
00:16:57,697 --> 00:17:00,754
We did it,
you masturbating little bastard.

343
00:17:01,056 --> 00:17:02,629
Champagne for everybody.

344
00:17:05,819 --> 00:17:06,950
It was so good.

345
00:17:07,070 --> 00:17:09,788
- You hated it, didn't you?
- It's so stupid. First of all,

346
00:17:09,908 --> 00:17:13,016
how do they understand that walking bear
they hang around with all the time?

347
00:17:13,176 --> 00:17:14,727
- Wookiee.
- He goes...

348
00:17:16,611 --> 00:17:18,452
They're all like,
"That's a good point, Bear,

349
00:17:18,572 --> 00:17:20,485
- "let's try that."
- He's a Wookiee,

350
00:17:20,605 --> 00:17:23,587
and his kind is actually
more intelligent than they appear.

351
00:17:26,275 --> 00:17:28,398
That is Ted's favorite movie
of all time.

352
00:17:28,518 --> 00:17:30,852
He watches it
when he's home sick with the flu.

353
00:17:30,972 --> 00:17:33,901
He watches it on rainy
Sunday afternoons in the fall.

354
00:17:34,256 --> 00:17:35,831
He watches it on Christmas Eve.

355
00:17:37,109 --> 00:17:40,010
Ted watches Star Wars
in sickness and in health,

356
00:17:40,130 --> 00:17:41,920
in good times and in bad.

357
00:17:43,097 --> 00:17:46,618
Do you really think that you can pretend
to like a movie that you actually hate

358
00:17:46,984 --> 00:17:48,463
for the rest of your life?

359
00:17:53,180 --> 00:17:54,180
I do.

360
00:17:56,094 --> 00:17:57,644
Then, Ted's a lucky guy.

361
00:18:02,643 --> 00:18:03,643
Bear.

362
00:18:07,769 --> 00:18:09,166
So, here's the deal.

363
00:18:09,286 --> 00:18:11,902
April, have... you met Barney?

364
00:18:15,197 --> 00:18:17,998
April just finished her shift,
she's looking to blow off some steam.

365
00:18:20,195 --> 00:18:22,103
Would you excuse us for one sec?

366
00:18:23,413 --> 00:18:25,907
- What are you doing?
- You were so nice to me tonight,

367
00:18:26,027 --> 00:18:28,341
I wanted to return the favor,
wingwoman-style.

368
00:18:29,704 --> 00:18:30,927
So, as I was saying,

369
00:18:31,087 --> 00:18:33,449
Barney is the Yankees'
new second-baseman.

370
00:18:33,569 --> 00:18:37,502
And Barney, April asked if tomorrow,
you could hit a goal for her

371
00:18:37,819 --> 00:18:39,475
during the baseball match.

372
00:18:39,865 --> 00:18:41,646
You can't make this stuff up.

373
00:18:42,635 --> 00:18:44,291
So, you two kids have fun.

374
00:18:47,373 --> 00:18:49,279
So are you...
nervous about the game?

375
00:18:49,439 --> 00:18:51,406
Yeah, I'm nervous
for the other team

376
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:54,493
'cause when I step
up to that plate...

377
00:18:57,250 --> 00:18:59,164
I am not a New York Yankee.

378
00:19:00,325 --> 00:19:02,976
Any other night, I would probably try
to convince you that I am, but I'm not.

379
00:19:03,096 --> 00:19:06,435
I'm just some guy who's in love
with the girl that just left,

380
00:19:06,983 --> 00:19:09,519
and she's never going
to feel the same way.

381
00:19:11,818 --> 00:19:13,215
So I'm just going to go.

382
00:19:14,506 --> 00:19:15,904
And that was it.

383
00:19:16,024 --> 00:19:17,682
I'm so sorry, Barney.

384
00:19:20,011 --> 00:19:21,292
You can't give up.

385
00:19:21,412 --> 00:19:24,689
You know, it may take some time,
but once Robin sees the new you...

386
00:19:25,934 --> 00:19:29,486
When my family gets to Yankee Stadium,
are the tickets under your name or mine?

387
00:19:29,646 --> 00:19:32,136
My name, and tell your
nephews to bring their mitts.

388
00:19:32,256 --> 00:19:34,074
They're going to be
in foul ball country.

389
00:19:36,611 --> 00:19:39,788
Come on.
The Robin stuff was completely true.

390
00:19:41,074 --> 00:19:42,292
Damn it, Barney.

391
00:19:42,412 --> 00:19:44,521
I mean, for the last time,

392
00:19:44,641 --> 00:19:46,650
you can't... you can't

393
00:19:46,897 --> 00:19:48,947
be in love with Robin
and still be sleeping

394
00:19:49,067 --> 00:19:50,933
with every bimbo on the planet.

395
00:19:51,166 --> 00:19:52,718
You have to choose right now.

396
00:19:54,957 --> 00:19:56,346
- I choose bimbos.
- What?

397
00:19:57,585 --> 00:20:00,795
Bimbos make me happy.
Bimbos make me feel alive.

398
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:05,147
Bimbos make me want
to pretend to be a better man.

399
00:20:05,624 --> 00:20:09,273
This whole thing with Robin was just
a fling, but at the end of the day,

400
00:20:09,393 --> 00:20:10,776
my heart belongs to bimbos.

401
00:20:11,713 --> 00:20:14,531
This is just a defense mechanism,
because

402
00:20:14,651 --> 00:20:17,784
you're afraid of getting hurt.
You're just confused.

403
00:20:17,944 --> 00:20:19,580
Oh, I'm not confused.

404
00:20:20,319 --> 00:20:21,869
You know who is confused?

405
00:20:22,370 --> 00:20:23,370
Bimbos.

406
00:20:23,731 --> 00:20:26,458
They're easily confused.
It's one of the thousand little things

407
00:20:26,578 --> 00:20:27,939
I love about them.

408
00:20:28,299 --> 00:20:30,242
I love their vacant,

409
00:20:30,457 --> 00:20:34,209
trusting stares, their sluggish,
unencumbered minds,

410
00:20:34,802 --> 00:20:36,692
their unresolved daddy issues.

411
00:20:37,399 --> 00:20:39,681
I love them and they love me.

412
00:20:40,496 --> 00:20:44,148
Bimbos have always been there for me,
through thick and thin.

413
00:20:44,829 --> 00:20:46,980
Mostly thin.
B- man don't do thick crust.

414
00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:48,106
What up?

415
00:20:48,266 --> 00:20:49,398
See you, Barney.

416
00:21:20,408 --> 00:21:21,258
Chimixanga.

417
00:21:21,259 --> 00:21:22,659
We have to go.
