1
00:00:02,223 --> 00:00:03,952
<i>Kids, in the fall of 2008,</i>

2
00:00:04,058 --> 00:00:06,890
<i>your aunt Robin was unemployed
and a little bit adrift.</i>

3
00:00:06,993 --> 00:00:09,360
<i>So she valued her friendship with Lily
more than ever.</i>

4
00:00:09,463 --> 00:00:12,296
Hey, so I hear Marshall has to work late
on Friday.

5
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:14,391
You know what that means. Ladies' night.

6
00:00:14,502 --> 00:00:17,402
Oh, actually one of the teachers
at my school, Jillian,

7
00:00:17,504 --> 00:00:20,996
- is having a birthday party.
- Oh, okay.

8
00:00:21,107 --> 00:00:22,132
What?

9
00:00:22,243 --> 00:00:25,507
It's just, I've never even heard
of this Jillian person before,

10
00:00:25,612 --> 00:00:29,241
and suddenly she's like your best friend.
You can't shut up about her.

11
00:00:29,349 --> 00:00:31,840
Don't be jealous.
You and I hang out all the time.

12
00:00:31,951 --> 00:00:33,713
Yeah, but Marshall's always there.

13
00:00:33,819 --> 00:00:37,278
We don't get a lot of quality time to talk,
just the two of us.

14
00:00:37,390 --> 00:00:38,982
That's not true.

15
00:00:39,325 --> 00:00:42,157
So that's when the story gets really good.

16
00:00:42,261 --> 00:00:44,126
So, we go to the...

17
00:00:44,229 --> 00:00:45,890
- Hey.
- Hey.

18
00:00:46,965 --> 00:00:51,902
...place. And then that guy
asks about the thing with the stuff

19
00:00:52,004 --> 00:00:54,131
that I told you about
at that place that time.

20
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:58,141
Long story short, events transpired.

21
00:00:58,609 --> 00:01:02,171
Oh, my God.
You and the guy from the mayor's office

22
00:01:02,281 --> 00:01:06,945
did it in the UN building under the desk
of the ambassador from Zaire? Nice.

23
00:01:07,685 --> 00:01:09,482
I just wish we could have some girl time.

24
00:01:09,587 --> 00:01:12,954
I love Marshall,
but he's always talk-blocking me.

25
00:01:13,057 --> 00:01:15,356
So come out with me and Jillian then.

26
00:01:15,461 --> 00:01:19,123
Okay, but I don't want to stay out
too late because...

27
00:01:19,263 --> 00:01:23,029
Remember that thing
last month after I went to the place?

28
00:01:23,134 --> 00:01:26,967
Well, you-know-who said it's fine,
but she gave me some stuff.

29
00:01:27,070 --> 00:01:29,869
You still got that yeast infection, huh?

30
00:01:44,154 --> 00:01:45,121
Marshall,

31
00:01:45,222 --> 00:01:47,782
- I want you to enjoy this moment.
- What moment?

32
00:01:47,891 --> 00:01:51,986
The last moment of you and I
being even slightly in competition

33
00:01:52,094 --> 00:01:53,561
for the title of Ted's best friend.

34
00:01:53,663 --> 00:01:56,325
- Marshall's my best friend.
- Exactly. It's a tie.

35
00:01:56,733 --> 00:01:58,166
But all of that is about to change.

36
00:01:58,268 --> 00:02:01,828
Ted, am I correct
that you are an architect?

37
00:02:01,937 --> 00:02:04,531
My best friend would really know that,
but go on.

38
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:07,542
And what are you currently designing?

39
00:02:07,643 --> 00:02:10,305
Actually, we're renovating
the new York Public Library.

40
00:02:10,412 --> 00:02:14,644
- Wow, Ted, that's huge!
- No, not the New York Public Library.

41
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:18,207
It's the new public library
in York, North Dakota.

42
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:21,778
Their books are in two sections,
fishing and non-fishing.

43
00:02:22,424 --> 00:02:25,984
Then I think you are going to really like
what happened at work today.

44
00:02:26,427 --> 00:02:29,225
And so, while those bribes
did destabilize the regime

45
00:02:29,330 --> 00:02:31,560
and caused the death
of most of the royal family,

46
00:02:31,666 --> 00:02:35,329
it did lead to looser banking regulations
in Rangoon.

47
00:02:35,436 --> 00:02:38,269
So yay us. Okay, last order of business.

48
00:02:38,373 --> 00:02:40,364
It's been decided we're going to move
forward with plans

49
00:02:40,475 --> 00:02:43,807
for Goliath National Bank's
new downtown headquarters.

50
00:02:44,278 --> 00:02:47,407
- Well, who's gonna design it?
- Was my first question.

51
00:02:47,882 --> 00:02:49,144
Who's gonna design it?

52
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:50,547
We've already approached one firm
about it.

53
00:02:50,652 --> 00:02:53,779
This Swedish architecture collective
called Sven.

54
00:02:54,488 --> 00:02:57,355
Sven? Sven?

55
00:02:58,025 --> 00:03:00,493
<i>Sven was this
Swedish architecture collective</i>

56
00:03:00,594 --> 00:03:04,394
<i>revered for their bold, innovative designs.
I hated those guys.</i>

57
00:03:04,498 --> 00:03:08,558
I hate those guys.
Swedish architecture collective.

58
00:03:08,668 --> 00:03:10,226
- Lame.
- Pretentious.

59
00:03:10,336 --> 00:03:12,567
"We're not a company. We're a collective. "

60
00:03:12,673 --> 00:03:15,301
I know.
"We are Swedish.

61
00:03:15,409 --> 00:03:20,072
"We are so cool with our baguettes
and our Eiffel Tower. "

62
00:03:20,179 --> 00:03:22,443
Dude, Sweden's not France.
You know that, right?

63
00:03:22,582 --> 00:03:23,947
Oh, it's France.

64
00:03:25,017 --> 00:03:27,485
So anyway, I say to Bilson...

65
00:03:27,987 --> 00:03:29,978
Bilson, with all due respect...

66
00:03:30,256 --> 00:03:33,350
No, I stand up, and I say to Bilson...

67
00:03:33,826 --> 00:03:36,055
Bilson, with all due respect...

68
00:03:36,194 --> 00:03:39,961
Music. Imagine patriotic music playing.

69
00:03:41,567 --> 00:03:45,969
Bilson, with all due respect,
it would be terrible

70
00:03:46,071 --> 00:03:51,337
if a job that could go to a hard-working
American architecture firm

71
00:03:51,442 --> 00:03:54,310
went to a bunch of French guys.

72
00:03:54,412 --> 00:03:58,041
Where is our patriotism?
Our sense of country?

73
00:03:58,149 --> 00:04:01,481
- Our love of all that is...
- Look, Stinson,

74
00:04:01,585 --> 00:04:04,486
no one hates every other country
in the world as much as I do,

75
00:04:04,588 --> 00:04:07,080
- but you better have a point.
- I do.

76
00:04:07,192 --> 00:04:11,525
I know a fantastic American architect
who would be perfect for the job.

77
00:04:11,629 --> 00:04:12,926
Ted Mosby.

78
00:04:13,464 --> 00:04:15,955
So, all you gotta do is come in,
pitch your design,

79
00:04:16,066 --> 00:04:18,500
I get the board to approve it,
and the job is yours.

80
00:04:18,602 --> 00:04:21,594
Do you realize what a hero I would be
if I brought this project to my firm?

81
00:04:21,705 --> 00:04:23,002
And that's not even the best part.

82
00:04:23,107 --> 00:04:25,337
All three of us
are gonna be working together.

83
00:04:25,442 --> 00:04:28,171
- Ted can be on the conference call.
- He can totally be on the conference call.

84
00:04:28,277 --> 00:04:30,302
- What's the conference call?
- The way it works is,

85
00:04:30,413 --> 00:04:32,712
one of us will duck
into the other's office and say...

86
00:04:33,150 --> 00:04:36,209
Marshall,
the conference call's about to start.

87
00:04:36,619 --> 00:04:38,382
I'm sorry, guys. I gotta go.

88
00:04:38,488 --> 00:04:42,447
<i>And then we go up
to the roof of the building and drink beer.</i>

89
00:04:42,558 --> 00:04:44,651
This is awesome.

90
00:04:44,761 --> 00:04:47,730
- Drinking at work.
- We're basically madmen.

91
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:50,355
We are! We're such mad men!

92
00:04:50,466 --> 00:04:52,262
I'm gonna go smack a secretary on the ass.

93
00:04:52,367 --> 00:04:55,359
That's totally what they would do
on that show.

94
00:04:55,470 --> 00:04:56,937
What show?

95
00:04:57,607 --> 00:05:01,872
And then, we throw
crumpled up beer cans at pigeons.

96
00:05:02,411 --> 00:05:05,278
- I don't do that.
- I totally want to do that.

97
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:06,870
Well, I am gonna make that happen.

98
00:05:06,982 --> 00:05:10,109
Seriously, Barney, after everything
I went through with Stella,

99
00:05:10,218 --> 00:05:13,346
getting me this opportunity...
It really means a lot.

100
00:05:13,455 --> 00:05:16,447
<i>It really did.
You see, kids, when I became an architect,</i>

101
00:05:16,558 --> 00:05:20,891
<i>I had one dream, to contribute a building
to the skyline of New York City.</i>

102
00:05:20,995 --> 00:05:23,590
<i>I wanted to be able to point
to one of those buildings and say,</i>

103
00:05:23,699 --> 00:05:27,134
<i>"See that one? That one right there?
That's mine. "</i>

104
00:05:28,502 --> 00:05:30,868
<i>This job was my opportunity
to do just that.</i>

105
00:05:36,342 --> 00:05:38,243
Wow!
Your friend's having her birthday here?

106
00:05:38,345 --> 00:05:42,975
- What's she turning, 19?
- No. Believe me, this isn't her scene.

107
00:05:43,150 --> 00:05:45,413
She probably just didn't know
what kind of place this was.

108
00:05:45,518 --> 00:05:49,853
Lily! Over here, you sexy bitch!
We've got bottle service!

109
00:05:52,892 --> 00:05:56,419
Oh, my God!
At school, she's so quiet and normal.

110
00:05:56,529 --> 00:06:00,397
I had no idea she's... She's a woo girl.

111
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,660
<i>What's a woo girl? Let me explain.</i>

112
00:06:03,770 --> 00:06:05,499
<i>A woo girl is a type of young woman</i>

113
00:06:05,605 --> 00:06:07,835
<i>who, like the cuckoo bird
or the whip-poor-will,</i>

114
00:06:07,941 --> 00:06:10,272
<i>gets her name from the signature sound
she makes.</i>

115
00:06:12,211 --> 00:06:14,736
<i>Now, a "woo" can be elicited
in many different ways.</i>

116
00:06:15,314 --> 00:06:17,112
<i>From a certain song coming on
the jukebox...</i>

117
00:06:20,486 --> 00:06:23,284
Oh, my God, this song is totally about me.

118
00:06:24,823 --> 00:06:26,586
<i>...to half-priced shots.</i>

119
00:06:29,094 --> 00:06:30,789
<i>From a ride on a mechanical bull...</i>

120
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:36,423
<i>...to, well, pretty much anything.</i>

121
00:06:36,534 --> 00:06:39,469
Oh, my God,
I was worried that I didn't feed the cat,

122
00:06:39,570 --> 00:06:42,039
but then I remembered that I did!

123
00:06:44,809 --> 00:06:48,802
I swear,
at school Jillian seems so unwoo-y.

124
00:06:49,647 --> 00:06:51,672
Yeah, she doesn't look woo-ish.

125
00:06:51,783 --> 00:06:53,750
Maybe she only observes
the High Holidays,

126
00:06:53,850 --> 00:06:57,912
like Mardi Gras and spring break.
Maybe she's just a cultural woo.

127
00:06:59,257 --> 00:07:02,191
Now, go easy on me.
It's a work in progress.

128
00:07:04,928 --> 00:07:06,418
Ted, this is amazing.

129
00:07:06,530 --> 00:07:10,296
The detail. The shading.
The playfulness of the lines.

130
00:07:11,101 --> 00:07:14,593
This is exactly what Princess Leia
would look like topless.

131
00:07:14,704 --> 00:07:16,262
My way of saying thanks.

132
00:07:16,373 --> 00:07:19,170
So, you want to see
my designs for the building?

133
00:07:19,275 --> 00:07:20,867
No, I'm good.

134
00:07:21,143 --> 00:07:24,477
Hey.
- Hey. So get this. Lily just texted me.

135
00:07:24,581 --> 00:07:28,311
She's at that bar Giddy Ups
with a bunch of woo girls.

136
00:07:30,686 --> 00:07:34,646
Oh, my God, you guys.
My boob just fell out of my top at the bar.

137
00:07:34,758 --> 00:07:36,918
Trick! I pulled it out for a free drink!

138
00:07:39,528 --> 00:07:43,157
So, Jillian,
I hear when you're not flashing bartenders,

139
00:07:43,265 --> 00:07:45,664
you teach the second grade.
What's that like?

140
00:07:45,767 --> 00:07:48,828
So rewarding. I don't know
if you're familiar with the RIE technique,

141
00:07:48,938 --> 00:07:52,339
but it derives from the progressive
educational philosophy of Rudolf Steiner,

142
00:07:52,441 --> 00:07:53,702
who founded the Waldorf School, which...

143
00:07:55,076 --> 00:08:00,070
Oh, my God. I love this song!
Come on, you lazy skanks. Let's dance!

144
00:08:02,016 --> 00:08:07,648
- You, too, you dumb whores.
- No, thank you, you ignorant hussy.

145
00:08:09,891 --> 00:08:12,859
Why, Lily Aldrin, you sly minx.

146
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:15,691
I've been saying for years
that our gang needed a woo girl,

147
00:08:15,797 --> 00:08:17,822
and here you've been hiding
a whole batch of them from me.

148
00:08:17,932 --> 00:08:20,957
We do not need a woo girl.
No one needs a woo girl.

149
00:08:21,068 --> 00:08:25,937
Be careful, Lily.
The world absolutely needs woo girls.

150
00:08:26,039 --> 00:08:29,304
<i>If there were no woo girls,
there'd be no Girls Gone Wild,</i>

151
00:08:29,409 --> 00:08:33,539
no bachelorette parties,
no Las Vegas poolside bars.

152
00:08:33,647 --> 00:08:36,740
All the things that you hold dearest, Lily,
would be gone.

153
00:08:36,849 --> 00:08:37,873
Those are none of the things...

154
00:08:37,984 --> 00:08:41,477
The souvenir shot glass industry
would collapse.

155
00:08:41,588 --> 00:08:46,547
So would the body glitter industry
and the stretch Hummer rental industry.

156
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:52,288
Tiny cowboy hats
would be worn only by tiny cowboys.

157
00:08:53,066 --> 00:08:56,523
<i>And when Brown Eyed Girl
would come up on the jukebox,</i>

158
00:08:56,636 --> 00:08:59,730
all you would hear would be silence.

159
00:09:01,607 --> 00:09:03,403
<i>And Brown Eyed Girl.</i>

160
00:09:03,875 --> 00:09:07,573
But who would woo, Lily?
Who would woo?

161
00:09:08,147 --> 00:09:09,444
Would you?

162
00:09:10,583 --> 00:09:13,551
Would you woo?

163
00:09:14,319 --> 00:09:16,480
Who wants to name my boobs?

164
00:09:20,025 --> 00:09:23,961
Now if you'll excuse me,
I have a date with Hannity and Colmes.

165
00:09:26,097 --> 00:09:28,496
<i>Over the next couple of weeks,
I dove into work.</i>

166
00:09:28,632 --> 00:09:31,499
<i>It felt great to be working on something
that I really cared about.</i>

167
00:09:31,602 --> 00:09:33,696
<i>Finally,
the morning of the presentation arrived.</i>

168
00:09:34,306 --> 00:09:40,403
And we believe this timeless design
will radiate the strength and stability

169
00:09:40,511 --> 00:09:44,003
that is Goliath National Bank.
Thank you, gentlemen.

170
00:09:47,518 --> 00:09:50,214
<i>I left there feeling pretty good
about my chances.</i>

171
00:09:50,321 --> 00:09:52,118
<i>Later that night, we ran into Barney.</i>

172
00:09:52,256 --> 00:09:55,153
Hey, Barney! Give me the good news.

173
00:09:55,825 --> 00:09:58,989
- You didn't get it.
- What?

174
00:09:59,096 --> 00:10:01,724
The board decided to go with Sven.

175
00:10:14,143 --> 00:10:18,136
I can't believe I didn't get it.
I really thought I nailed the pitch.

176
00:10:18,247 --> 00:10:19,680
Why would they go with Sven?

177
00:10:19,782 --> 00:10:22,011
I did everything I could
to change their minds.

178
00:10:22,117 --> 00:10:27,488
- But they wouldn't budge. I'm sorry.
- Wow, this really sucks.

179
00:10:28,358 --> 00:10:31,690
After the way these last couple of months
have gone,

180
00:10:31,793 --> 00:10:34,660
I guess I needed this more
than I thought I did.

181
00:10:35,163 --> 00:10:36,494
Hey,

182
00:10:37,532 --> 00:10:42,765
you want to go down to the current GNB
building and just, like... I don't know.

183
00:10:43,739 --> 00:10:45,866
Just pee on it a little bit?

184
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:49,204
Yeah. Yeah, I think I need that.

185
00:10:51,213 --> 00:10:53,579
Finish your beer. Fill the tank.

186
00:10:57,518 --> 00:11:00,487
- What happened?
- Ted didn't get that job.

187
00:11:01,022 --> 00:11:04,423
But that's not the biggest disappointment
of the day.

188
00:11:04,525 --> 00:11:06,959
- What?
- We saw you woo.

189
00:11:07,595 --> 00:11:09,654
- Saw who woo?
- Saw you woo.

190
00:11:09,764 --> 00:11:11,356
- I didn't woo.
- You did, too.

191
00:11:11,465 --> 00:11:14,092
- That's not true.
- Your nose just grew.

192
00:11:14,601 --> 00:11:17,332
So what, you're like
best friends with Jillian now?

193
00:11:17,438 --> 00:11:21,271
No. It's just...
You're married, Lily, but I'm still single.

194
00:11:21,374 --> 00:11:24,901
Whenever I hang out with you, I'm usually
the third wheel to you and Marshall.

195
00:11:25,011 --> 00:11:27,241
Sometimes it's fun to go out
with other single women

196
00:11:27,347 --> 00:11:31,010
- and do stuff that you don't want to.
- Like what?

197
00:11:31,117 --> 00:11:33,950
Like woo, Lily. Like woo.

198
00:11:34,054 --> 00:11:35,749
- I can woo.
- That's not true.

199
00:11:35,855 --> 00:11:38,288
- I can, too.
- It's just not you.

200
00:11:41,293 --> 00:11:42,521
- Bilson.
- Yeah?

201
00:11:42,628 --> 00:11:47,224
Hey. Look, I just want to say,
I know you guys went with Sven,

202
00:11:47,332 --> 00:11:49,232
but Ted Mosby is tremendously talented,

203
00:11:49,334 --> 00:11:51,859
and I think he would have done
a hell of a job.

204
00:11:51,970 --> 00:11:54,461
I agree. That's why I voted for him.

205
00:11:55,274 --> 00:11:56,331
So, then, it's agreed.

206
00:11:56,441 --> 00:12:00,105
From now on, all ATM fees
are now called freedom charges.

207
00:12:00,612 --> 00:12:02,239
Conference call. Now.

208
00:12:06,451 --> 00:12:09,011
- You got something you want to tell me?
- Oh, damn it.

209
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:12,113
I told Heather to put everything
back on your desk the way it was.

210
00:12:12,224 --> 00:12:16,319
Bilson told me he wanted to give
the job to Ted. So what happened?

211
00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:20,997
Okay, fine.

212
00:12:21,698 --> 00:12:24,862
...will radiate the strength and stability

213
00:12:24,969 --> 00:12:28,427
that is Goliath National Bank.
Thank you, gentlemen.

214
00:12:36,747 --> 00:12:39,806
- So?
- That was great. I love it.

215
00:12:39,916 --> 00:12:44,046
Yes! Looks like we got our guy.
I don't think we even need to meet with...

216
00:12:45,689 --> 00:12:47,088
I am Sven Jorgensen.

217
00:12:47,190 --> 00:12:51,024
With me are Sven Pilsen
and Sven Johanssen, and we are Sven!

218
00:12:51,128 --> 00:12:52,755
- Sven!
- Sven!

219
00:12:52,863 --> 00:12:54,626
You are Goliath National Bank.

220
00:12:54,731 --> 00:12:57,824
You are cutting edge.
You are new. You are fresh.

221
00:12:57,933 --> 00:13:00,401
Women want to be with you,
men wish to harm you,

222
00:13:00,503 --> 00:13:03,905
but the fool who dares challenge you
shall be crushed!

223
00:13:04,007 --> 00:13:06,873
Your headquarters will tell the world
of these facts.

224
00:13:06,976 --> 00:13:09,536
And one more thing, don't look now!

225
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:13,975
Which of you is Barney Stinson,
head of the search committee?

226
00:13:14,082 --> 00:13:15,812
Oh, my God. That's me!

227
00:13:15,918 --> 00:13:19,046
You, Barney Stinson,
are a man of power and virility.

228
00:13:19,155 --> 00:13:22,749
Your office shall be here,
in the head of a Tyrannosaurus rex!

229
00:13:22,857 --> 00:13:26,020
I never knew it till now,
but I've always dreamed of that.

230
00:13:26,127 --> 00:13:30,030
On your large desk of Honduran rosewood
shall be this button.

231
00:13:30,132 --> 00:13:33,692
- What does the button do?
- Press it! Press it for glory!

232
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:41,969
Yes! This is the most awesome building
in the universe.

233
00:13:42,076 --> 00:13:44,636
There is no way this building
could be more awesome.

234
00:13:44,746 --> 00:13:47,442
There is a strip club in the letter N.

235
00:13:50,717 --> 00:13:54,118
What the hell is the matter with you?
This is Ted's big break!

236
00:13:54,221 --> 00:13:55,917
And then you sold him out
because you wanted to work

237
00:13:56,024 --> 00:13:57,820
in the brain of a Tyrannosaurus rex,

238
00:13:57,925 --> 00:13:59,950
which, incidentally, if you knew
anything about dinosaurs,

239
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:04,292
- is really, really small.
- Marshall, this isn't about my office.

240
00:14:04,398 --> 00:14:06,888
Ted's building was good.
Sven's was better.

241
00:14:06,999 --> 00:14:11,437
And I am not going to let the fact that I am
Ted's best friend be a factor in business.

242
00:14:11,538 --> 00:14:13,096
You didn't pick Sven's building
because it was better.

243
00:14:13,207 --> 00:14:15,436
You picked it because you wanted to work
in a cool dinosaur office.

244
00:14:15,541 --> 00:14:19,637
That's a lie! I picked it because it...

245
00:14:20,246 --> 00:14:22,510
It breathes fire, Marshall.

246
00:14:23,482 --> 00:14:25,040
Fire marshal.

247
00:14:26,719 --> 00:14:29,449
- I didn't even notice.
- How could you do this to Ted

248
00:14:29,555 --> 00:14:31,317
after everything he's been through
with Stella?

249
00:14:31,423 --> 00:14:32,913
You're just being selfish.

250
00:14:33,024 --> 00:14:37,086
Marshall, I would never make
a business decision for selfish reasons.

251
00:14:37,196 --> 00:14:39,823
I am a professional. Now, come on.

252
00:14:39,931 --> 00:14:42,491
Let's get a nice daytime drunk going,
and throw empties at pigeons.

253
00:14:42,601 --> 00:14:44,694
No. No. For two reasons.

254
00:14:44,803 --> 00:14:47,796
One, pigeons are smarter than you think.
They hold grudges.

255
00:14:47,907 --> 00:14:52,240
And, two, this is our last conference call,
Mr. Stinson.

256
00:14:52,344 --> 00:14:54,369
There are repercussions
to screwing over a friend.

257
00:14:54,479 --> 00:14:56,003
- Like what?
- Like this.

258
00:14:58,782 --> 00:14:59,840
Hey.

259
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:27,003
Oh, my God, you guys. Last night,
we raised $10,000 for my charity

260
00:15:27,111 --> 00:15:31,138
to help combat childhood illiteracy.
It's a really serious issue.

261
00:15:33,883 --> 00:15:38,911
Someone just earned herself an ass-first
ride down the dance floor spank canyon!

262
00:15:47,864 --> 00:15:49,330
Lily, what are you doing here?

263
00:15:49,431 --> 00:15:52,663
Oh, just doing the fun things
you single girls do.

264
00:15:52,769 --> 00:15:55,169
What's with the plastic fireman's hat?

265
00:15:55,271 --> 00:15:59,570
I didn't have a cowboy hat, and today was
fire safety day at school, so...

266
00:16:00,976 --> 00:16:06,039
- Oh, my God, bitch. This is our anthem.
- Really? Who sings this?

267
00:16:07,582 --> 00:16:09,880
Is LL Cool J still doing things?

268
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:13,283
This is great, Svens.

269
00:16:13,622 --> 00:16:15,714
You guys are so much cooler
than Marshall.

270
00:16:15,823 --> 00:16:18,018
He doesn't even own a unitard.

271
00:16:18,592 --> 00:16:21,858
- Who wants a brew?
- I don't understand.

272
00:16:22,030 --> 00:16:24,156
Where is the conference call?

273
00:16:24,265 --> 00:16:27,063
No, no. This is the conference call. Get it?

274
00:16:27,168 --> 00:16:31,161
In America, when we work late,
we lie about a conference call,

275
00:16:31,272 --> 00:16:34,105
and we come up here
and we drink a few beers. It's awesome.

276
00:16:34,208 --> 00:16:36,768
This is a waste of time. Push-ups!

277
00:16:38,913 --> 00:16:42,439
Misty, you are such a slut.
Let's do another shot.

278
00:16:44,551 --> 00:16:47,783
You're the slut, you skank.
Shots are on you.

279
00:16:49,522 --> 00:16:52,685
No, bitch, shots are on you.
You're such a whore.

280
00:16:54,327 --> 00:16:58,320
You're all a bunch of prostitutes.
You probably have STDs.

281
00:17:02,502 --> 00:17:04,026
Let's go dance.

282
00:17:08,941 --> 00:17:11,308
Lily, this isn't working.
You shouldn't be here.

283
00:17:11,411 --> 00:17:14,938
I get it. Because I'm happily
married, I'm some kind of loser?

284
00:17:15,048 --> 00:17:16,571
Exactly the opposite.

285
00:17:16,682 --> 00:17:19,947
Lily, why do you think
the woo girls have to woo

286
00:17:20,052 --> 00:17:23,987
when they win a game of beer pong,
or when a hot guy takes his shirt off?

287
00:17:24,088 --> 00:17:29,152
It's because that is as good as life gets
for them. They're really sad people.

288
00:17:29,661 --> 00:17:31,993
And when they hang out
with someone who's got it all figured out,

289
00:17:32,097 --> 00:17:36,465
someone like you, it bums them out.
It takes away their woo.

290
00:17:36,567 --> 00:17:39,867
You're just saying that
so I don't feel like an old married lady.

291
00:17:39,972 --> 00:17:42,064
Look at those girls, Lily.

292
00:17:42,173 --> 00:17:45,609
Look at them and listen
to what their woos are really saying.

293
00:18:07,964 --> 00:18:13,732
Oh, those poor girls and Ted.
I just want to go give them all a hug.

294
00:18:13,837 --> 00:18:19,605
Lily, right now I'm like them.
I'm unemployed, I'm single, I'm a little lost.

295
00:18:19,876 --> 00:18:23,175
So every once in a while, I need to woo.

296
00:18:23,513 --> 00:18:27,881
But when I need to talk about something
real, you're the one I turn to.

297
00:18:28,417 --> 00:18:31,012
- You're my best friend.
- And you're mine.

298
00:18:31,121 --> 00:18:34,055
And I promise
I'll make more time for just us.

299
00:18:34,156 --> 00:18:36,886
Marshall doesn't have to tag along
to everything we do.

300
00:18:36,992 --> 00:18:39,483
Hey, have you guys tried these
purple hooter test tube shots?

301
00:18:39,595 --> 00:18:42,324
I've had like five of them.
I don't even think there's alcohol in here.

302
00:18:42,430 --> 00:18:44,922
- Where'd you get that hat?
- What hat?

303
00:18:48,137 --> 00:18:51,503
- Hey. We fired Sven.
- What?

304
00:18:51,606 --> 00:18:55,565
Yeah, those guys were idiots.
I mean, sure, they had some cool ideas.

305
00:18:55,677 --> 00:18:58,579
Some really cool ideas.
Actually, I wonder if it's not too late to...

306
00:18:58,681 --> 00:19:02,582
No! The point is, you got the job.

307
00:19:02,684 --> 00:19:03,708
- Really?
- Yeah.

308
00:19:03,818 --> 00:19:06,548
The search committee realized
they made the wrong decision.

309
00:19:06,654 --> 00:19:11,318
Plus, you really mean a lot to them
and they want you to be happy.

310
00:19:11,426 --> 00:19:13,018
That's weird.

311
00:19:13,127 --> 00:19:16,687
Look, Ted, your design was the best,
and you deserve it.

312
00:19:18,832 --> 00:19:20,527
There's also something
that you should know

313
00:19:20,634 --> 00:19:24,002
about why you didn't get the job
in the first place.

314
00:19:24,105 --> 00:19:26,095
- You see, Ted...
- It was Bilson.

315
00:19:26,206 --> 00:19:27,673
Yeah, yeah.

316
00:19:27,774 --> 00:19:31,266
Bilson just wanted to have an office
in a dinosaur head,

317
00:19:31,378 --> 00:19:34,175
but Barney convinced him
that it was really, really stupid.

318
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:37,584
- Well, you know.
- Oh. Thank you, Barney.

319
00:19:38,268 --> 00:19:39,462
What... I can't believe this.

320
00:19:39,570 --> 00:19:42,470
I just got our firm
the biggest account we've ever had.

321
00:19:45,675 --> 00:19:48,041
Hey, next round's on me.

322
00:19:52,281 --> 00:19:54,476
Why'd you let me off the hook?

323
00:19:55,084 --> 00:19:58,645
You did the right thing.
Seemed like you deserved a bye.

324
00:19:59,121 --> 00:20:02,955
Plus, it would have really bummed Ted out,
and he's finally happy right now.

325
00:20:03,059 --> 00:20:05,527
Yeah. Well.

326
00:20:06,696 --> 00:20:09,061
You really are Ted's best friend.

327
00:20:10,632 --> 00:20:14,899
And so am I. It's a tie. Thanks, Marshall.

328
00:20:15,004 --> 00:20:17,528
<i>Marshall wound up caving
and telling me the truth about Barney,</i>

329
00:20:17,639 --> 00:20:19,038
<i>like ten minutes later.</i>

330
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:21,665
<i>At which point we tied Uncle Barney
to the mechanical bull,</i>

331
00:20:21,776 --> 00:20:23,971
<i>cranked it up to a setting called
"paint mixer,"and went home.</i>

332
00:20:25,746 --> 00:20:27,611
- I love you, man.
- Love you, too, buddy.

333
00:20:27,716 --> 00:20:29,274
Hey, you going to ride the bull tonight?

334
00:20:29,384 --> 00:20:32,547
No, not if you paid me.
I have an inner ear thing.

335
00:20:32,721 --> 00:20:34,881
<i>It was a pretty great night.</i>

336
00:20:38,292 --> 00:20:40,692
Three hours. That's a bar record.

337
00:20:41,730 --> 00:20:43,492
That's right, ladies.

338
00:20:44,798 --> 00:20:48,825
Jillian, you know what'd be really crazy
and funny and stupid to do tonight?

339
00:20:48,936 --> 00:20:51,961
If you and me find a guy
and have a three-way.

340
00:20:52,572 --> 00:20:55,041
Maybe, if we found the right guy.

341
00:20:55,843 --> 00:21:00,279
Yeah, and if we don't find the right guy,
maybe you and I could just...

342
00:21:00,380 --> 00:21:04,749
You know who was pretty cute?
That guy Ted. Let's go find him.
