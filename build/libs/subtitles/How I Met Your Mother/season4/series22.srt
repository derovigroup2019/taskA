00:00:02,314 --> 00:00:04,651
<i>In May of 2009,
I was on the verge of scoring</i>

2
00:00:04,776 --> 00:00:07,430
<i>my first big client
as an independent architect.</i>

3
00:00:07,555 --> 00:00:09,637
<i>I was willing to do anything
to make it happen.</i>

4
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:12,690
Here's what we want, son.
It's real simple.

5
00:00:12,952 --> 00:00:15,097
We're opening a restaurant
called Rib Town

6
00:00:15,509 --> 00:00:17,462
and we want it to be shaped

7
00:00:17,688 --> 00:00:19,313
like a cowboy hat.

8
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:21,340
<i>Anything.</i>

9
00:00:21,612 --> 00:00:22,566
A cowboy hat?

10
00:00:23,652 --> 00:00:25,002
That's brilliant.

11
00:00:25,328 --> 00:00:26,188
I love it!

12
00:00:26,313 --> 00:00:29,490
I mean, nothing says delicious
like the inside of a cowboy hat, right?

13
00:00:29,847 --> 00:00:31,873
Look, I'm telling you, I'm your guy.

14
00:00:33,452 --> 00:00:35,972
I think I was born
to design this building.

15
00:00:36,097 --> 00:00:36,975
I just...

16
00:00:37,409 --> 00:00:38,301
I see it.

17
00:00:38,625 --> 00:00:41,669
I don't see it. I don't see it.
I don't see it.

18
00:00:42,796 --> 00:00:44,254
What's so good about it?

19
00:00:44,795 --> 00:00:45,673
Up all night?

20
00:00:45,841 --> 00:00:48,058
I told these guys
I have a vision for this thing.

21
00:00:48,183 --> 00:00:50,597
They want to see a pitch
in a week and I got nothing.

22
00:00:51,012 --> 00:00:52,805
- It's cute.
- Cute?

23
00:00:54,136 --> 00:00:57,309
I could be designing concert halls
and bridges.

24
00:00:57,477 --> 00:01:00,353
Bridges so beautiful
they could be in museums.

25
00:01:00,478 --> 00:01:02,856
And I could design those museums.

26
00:01:03,365 --> 00:01:06,382
But what am I designing instead?
What has my career come to?

27
00:01:06,507 --> 00:01:10,392
A two-story Stetson
with outdoor dining on the brim.

28
00:01:11,470 --> 00:01:13,436
It's a sick cosmic joke.

29
00:01:13,561 --> 00:01:15,411
The universe
is conspiring against me.

30
00:01:16,389 --> 00:01:19,351
You just need to get out of the house.
Take a walk. Get a bagel.

31
00:01:20,331 --> 00:01:22,029
Yeah, that'll solve everything.

32
00:01:22,154 --> 00:01:24,964
I haven't slept for 34 hours,
but a bagel is the answer.

33
00:01:25,089 --> 00:01:28,048
A cinnamon raisin bagel
with a little cream cheese.

34
00:01:28,838 --> 00:01:30,884
That sounds pretty good,
I'm going to get a bagel.

35
00:01:31,442 --> 00:01:33,220
Bring an umbrella.
It's supposed to rain,

36
00:01:33,345 --> 00:01:35,055
according to Galoshes,
our weather clown.

37
00:01:35,223 --> 00:01:37,563
Your show has a clown
who does the weather?

38
00:01:37,688 --> 00:01:39,152
That's a little cheesy, no?

39
00:01:40,061 --> 00:01:43,711
And what's that restaurant
you're designing shaped like, Hoss?

40
00:01:45,063 --> 00:01:46,728
Fine.
You want me out of the house,

41
00:01:46,853 --> 00:01:48,527
I'll get out of the house.

42
00:01:48,695 --> 00:01:52,545
Can't wait to see what the universe
has lined up for me out there.

43
00:01:56,994 --> 00:02:00,049
<i>Kids, I've been telling you
the story of how I met your mother.</i>

44
00:02:00,174 --> 00:02:02,539
<i>And while there's many things
to learn from this story,</i>

45
00:02:02,664 --> 00:02:04,364
<i>this may be the biggest.</i>

46
00:02:04,692 --> 00:02:08,130
<i>The great moments of your life
won't necessarily be the things you do.</i>

47
00:02:08,255 --> 00:02:10,933
<i>They'll also be the things
that happen to you.</i>

48
00:02:11,058 --> 00:02:14,136
<i>I'm not saying you can't take action
to affect the outcome of your life.</i>

49
00:02:14,803 --> 00:02:17,253
<i>You have to take action,
and you will.</i>

50
00:02:18,231 --> 00:02:20,393
<i>But never forget that, on any day,</i>

51
00:02:20,518 --> 00:02:24,008
<i>you could step out the front door
and your whole life can change forever.</i>

52
00:02:24,875 --> 00:02:27,203
<i>You see,
the universe has a plan, kids,</i>

53
00:02:27,328 --> 00:02:29,276
<i>and that plan is always in motion.</i>

54
00:02:30,373 --> 00:02:32,370
<i>A butterfly flaps its wings...</i>

55
00:02:33,211 --> 00:02:34,961
<i>and it starts to rain.</i>

56
00:02:35,585 --> 00:02:38,439
<i>It's a scary thought.
But it's also kind of wonderful.</i>

57
00:02:38,698 --> 00:02:41,698
<i>All these little parts of the machine
constantly working,</i>

58
00:02:41,823 --> 00:02:44,652
<i>making sure that you end up
exactly where you're supposed to be,</i>

59
00:02:44,777 --> 00:02:46,948
<i>exactly when you're supposed
to be there.</i>

60
00:02:47,222 --> 00:02:49,878
<i>The right place...
at the right time.</i>

61
00:02:51,735 --> 00:02:54,235
Sync by vNaru

62
00:03:07,373 --> 00:03:10,137
<i>Kids, it's a miracle
that I ended up on that street corner.</i>

63
00:03:10,262 --> 00:03:13,209
<i>Especially when you consider how easy
it would have been not to end up there.</i>

64
00:03:13,863 --> 00:03:15,878
<i>I mean, when I first
stepped out of the apartment,</i>

65
00:03:16,046 --> 00:03:18,227
<i>I almost went right instead of left.</i>

66
00:03:18,352 --> 00:03:19,612
<i>Why didn't I go right?</i>

67
00:03:19,737 --> 00:03:21,676
<i>To answer that,
we have to go back a few days.</i>

68
00:03:22,317 --> 00:03:25,096
<i>As you know, back then,
your Aunt Robin hosted a morning show.</i>

69
00:03:25,546 --> 00:03:28,634
Now Eunice here
makes all of these purses herself.

70
00:03:28,993 --> 00:03:31,625
They're hand embroidered
with the world's finest silk.

71
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:34,082
And each one takes months to make.

72
00:03:34,207 --> 00:03:37,295
I cannot emphasize
how much work goes into...

73
00:03:41,435 --> 00:03:42,905
Go to weather, you idiot.

74
00:03:45,048 --> 00:03:46,350
Hey, everybody.

75
00:03:46,475 --> 00:03:49,245
We got a high pressure system
coming in from the west and...

76
00:03:51,962 --> 00:03:55,223
On the plus side,
I bought the cutest purse today.

77
00:03:55,888 --> 00:03:57,586
So, wait, why did you throw up?

78
00:03:58,439 --> 00:04:00,589
- You don't want to know.
- Come on. Tell me.

79
00:04:02,017 --> 00:04:03,009
I'm pregnant.

80
00:04:03,601 --> 00:04:06,426
I will raise this child with you.
You are not alone in this.

81
00:04:06,551 --> 00:04:09,346
We can even get married if you want,
but I still want to see other girls,

82
00:04:09,471 --> 00:04:11,925
- it would've to be one of those kind...
- God, stop it.

83
00:04:12,050 --> 00:04:14,437
I'm not pregnant.
It's food poisoning.

84
00:04:16,106 --> 00:04:18,183
I ate something from this place,

85
00:04:18,308 --> 00:04:21,944
and three hours later,
I was spewing like an open hydrant.

86
00:04:22,210 --> 00:04:25,531
- God. From where?
- Well, that's a gross question.

87
00:04:25,699 --> 00:04:27,325
No, where was the food from?

88
00:04:29,227 --> 00:04:30,786
- I don't want to tell you.
- What?

89
00:04:31,362 --> 00:04:33,982
Go to YouTube. Put in
"Robin Scherbatsky morning show vomit"

90
00:04:34,107 --> 00:04:35,499
Robin, home so soon.

91
00:04:36,394 --> 00:04:38,169
Someone already put it on YouTube?

92
00:04:38,631 --> 00:04:40,191
Yeah... Someone.

93
00:04:42,299 --> 00:04:44,467
So...
Why you been throwing up? You pregnant?

94
00:04:44,635 --> 00:04:46,469
Yeah, Barney. I'm pregnant.

95
00:04:51,219 --> 00:04:53,559
So, wait, why won't you tell me
where you got food poisoning?

96
00:04:53,727 --> 00:04:56,812
You love this place.
If I tell you, it'll just ruin it.

97
00:04:58,591 --> 00:05:00,370
- That makes sense.
- Yeah.

98
00:05:00,495 --> 00:05:01,745
Don't tell me.

99
00:05:02,486 --> 00:05:04,820
Is it that Indian place where the cat
jumps on all the tables?

100
00:05:04,988 --> 00:05:05,951
I'm not saying.

101
00:05:06,076 --> 00:05:09,178
- That Spanish place with baby's crib?
- I'm not saying.

102
00:05:10,139 --> 00:05:10,993
God, no.

103
00:05:13,506 --> 00:05:15,831
Is it this place?
Tell me, damn you!

104
00:05:15,999 --> 00:05:18,199
- You really want to know?
- Yes!

105
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:20,713
It's Schlegel's Bagels.

106
00:05:20,838 --> 00:05:22,588
Why did you tell me that?

107
00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:25,919
Schlegel's?
Thanks a lot, Robin.

108
00:05:26,398 --> 00:05:28,559
Now I'm gonna have to try to find
another place in NY

109
00:05:28,684 --> 00:05:30,220
that serves bagels.

110
00:05:32,349 --> 00:05:35,138
<i>So, you see, kids, if I had gone
to Schlegel's Bagels as usual,</i>

111
00:05:35,263 --> 00:05:36,894
<i>I would have taken a right.</i>

112
00:05:37,637 --> 00:05:39,430
<i>I would have gotten a bagel...</i>

113
00:05:39,555 --> 00:05:41,649
<i>gone home,
worked on the old hat building,</i>

114
00:05:42,146 --> 00:05:44,276
<i>and you kids
might never have been born.</i>

115
00:05:44,813 --> 00:05:48,663
<i>But I turned left instead, to go
to my second-favorite bagel place</i>

116
00:05:49,143 --> 00:05:50,843
<i>and the rest is history.</i>

117
00:05:51,095 --> 00:05:54,094
<i>Of course, I stopped
at that magazine stand on the way.</i>

118
00:05:54,311 --> 00:05:56,705
<i>Why did I stop there?
Here's why.</i>

119
00:06:02,879 --> 00:06:04,329
<i>Bro's Life</i> magazine.

120
00:06:05,098 --> 00:06:07,075
Page 83.
Check it.

121
00:06:08,727 --> 00:06:11,423
"What your paintball gun says
about your personality"?

122
00:06:11,548 --> 00:06:12,430
Below that.

123
00:06:13,007 --> 00:06:15,641
"That last five pounds:
How to get her to lose them."

124
00:06:15,809 --> 00:06:17,059
Above that.

125
00:06:17,744 --> 00:06:19,395
Petra Petrova.

126
00:06:21,496 --> 00:06:25,192
<i>Bro's Life</i> magazine's
girl of the year for may.

127
00:06:25,564 --> 00:06:28,459
A delicate flower in stiletto pumps
and leopard panties,

128
00:06:28,584 --> 00:06:29,905
straddling an ATV.

129
00:06:30,073 --> 00:06:33,075
These magazines are so lame. I mean,
she's probably airbrushed and enhanced.

130
00:06:33,243 --> 00:06:36,313
- I have a date with her.
- You are my hero! Are you serious?

131
00:06:36,438 --> 00:06:39,104
- How do you have a date with her?
- Not part of the story.

132
00:06:39,229 --> 00:06:42,225
Ted, I have been waiting
a long time to say this.

133
00:06:42,963 --> 00:06:44,983
This girl is the one.

134
00:06:45,297 --> 00:06:47,481
Of course she's the one.
You have to marry those.

135
00:06:47,606 --> 00:06:48,606
Her.

136
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:50,919
Marry?

137
00:06:52,856 --> 00:06:56,182
I have something much,
much more special in mind.

138
00:06:56,856 --> 00:06:59,009
Petra here, if all goes well,

139
00:06:59,217 --> 00:07:01,402
will be my...
wait for it, two hundredth.

140
00:07:01,527 --> 00:07:03,272
Sorry, I couldn't wait.
It's all exciting.

141
00:07:03,611 --> 00:07:06,442
Your two hundredth,
as in "sex with"?

142
00:07:06,610 --> 00:07:08,130
As in "sex with."

143
00:07:08,255 --> 00:07:11,030
I request the highest of fives.

144
00:07:11,536 --> 00:07:13,908
Not if I was wearing a HazMat suit.

145
00:07:14,937 --> 00:07:16,423
200 is too many.

146
00:07:17,108 --> 00:07:21,090
Right, 'cause there can be
too many of something wonderful.

147
00:07:21,215 --> 00:07:24,210
"Babe Ruth, easy, big fella.
Let's not hit too many homers."

148
00:07:25,212 --> 00:07:28,324
"Steve Guttenberg, maybe just make
three Police Academy movies.

149
00:07:28,449 --> 00:07:30,090
"America's laughed enough."

150
00:07:30,327 --> 00:07:31,634
Who are these girls?

151
00:07:32,065 --> 00:07:34,011
That was rhetorical.
Don't show me the list.

152
00:07:34,179 --> 00:07:37,264
199 satisfied customers.

153
00:07:37,532 --> 00:07:39,767
Anyway, the big night is Thursday.

154
00:07:40,026 --> 00:07:42,811
I'm having a celebratory soir?e
beforehand at MacLaren's.

155
00:07:43,517 --> 00:07:46,546
Prepare a toast.
Black tie optional, but preferred.

156
00:07:46,671 --> 00:07:50,005
Gifts are, look, I would say
unnecessary, but follow your heart.

157
00:07:50,489 --> 00:07:51,654
200's too many.

158
00:07:51,822 --> 00:07:53,656
- It's not too many.
- It's too many!

159
00:07:53,899 --> 00:07:55,950
- It's not too many.
- Thank you.

160
00:07:56,118 --> 00:07:57,362
No, don't get me wrong.

161
00:07:57,487 --> 00:08:01,080
You're disgusting, and the cops should
probably clamp a boot on your genitals,

162
00:08:01,248 --> 00:08:03,439
but that number should be higher.

163
00:08:03,564 --> 00:08:06,458
After Barney told me about all this,
I crunched the numbers and,

164
00:08:06,583 --> 00:08:07,583
well...

165
00:08:07,796 --> 00:08:09,171
I had some charts made up.

166
00:08:11,178 --> 00:08:13,676
Barney here
hits on roughly 20 girls a week.

167
00:08:14,163 --> 00:08:17,913
It's way more than 20.
And B. Smooth don't do nothing roughly.

168
00:08:19,057 --> 00:08:21,137
Let's say 20.
So, 20 girls a week means

169
00:08:21,262 --> 00:08:23,769
1,040 girls a year.

170
00:08:23,937 --> 00:08:26,612
In Barney's 16 years
of sexual activity,

171
00:08:26,737 --> 00:08:30,734
that means he's hit on 16,640 girls.

172
00:08:31,104 --> 00:08:33,781
Now, if he's bedded 199 of them,

173
00:08:33,906 --> 00:08:35,806
that is a success rate of...

174
00:08:37,558 --> 00:08:40,869
a little over one percent.

175
00:08:41,591 --> 00:08:43,706
That's a batting average of 12,

176
00:08:43,874 --> 00:08:47,215
eight times worse than
the career batting average of...

177
00:08:47,572 --> 00:08:49,750
one-handed pitcher, that's right,

178
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:52,044
pitcher... Jim Abbott.

179
00:08:54,955 --> 00:08:55,718
Jealous.

180
00:08:56,250 --> 00:08:57,011
Jealous.

181
00:08:57,502 --> 00:08:58,387
Hero.

182
00:08:58,875 --> 00:09:00,928
Suspiciously quiet
during this conversation

183
00:09:01,053 --> 00:09:03,684
about number of sex partners. Hero.

184
00:09:04,037 --> 00:09:06,895
It's the grand total.
That's the only number that matters.

185
00:09:07,063 --> 00:09:09,113
- Says who?
- Matthew Panning,

186
00:09:09,682 --> 00:09:12,359
the stud of Port Richmond
Middle School.

187
00:09:12,736 --> 00:09:14,950
Stinson, you're such a dweeb-o.

188
00:09:15,075 --> 00:09:16,864
I bet you never
even done it with a girl.

189
00:09:17,032 --> 00:09:18,432
Neither have you.

190
00:09:18,557 --> 00:09:20,803
How many times do I have
to explain this?

191
00:09:20,928 --> 00:09:22,414
I've done it with 100 girls.

192
00:09:22,539 --> 00:09:25,039
They're seventh graders
at my cousin's school on Long Island.

193
00:09:25,466 --> 00:09:28,751
Well, you know what, Matthew?
Someday, I'm gonna do it with 200.

194
00:09:30,615 --> 00:09:32,546
Yeah.
Call me when that happens.

195
00:09:34,217 --> 00:09:36,295
And call him I will.

196
00:09:37,367 --> 00:09:39,678
I think he's gonna say it again
really slow.

197
00:09:40,391 --> 00:09:41,893
Call him...

198
00:09:43,045 --> 00:09:44,163
I will.

199
00:09:46,269 --> 00:09:49,734
You listed Gaby Allan twice,
as 78 and 162.

200
00:09:49,859 --> 00:09:51,681
What? Let me see.

201
00:09:51,806 --> 00:09:52,856
Seventy...

202
00:09:53,177 --> 00:09:54,696
Once. Oh, my God.

203
00:09:55,764 --> 00:09:57,942
Wait a...
I counted the same girl twice?

204
00:09:58,067 --> 00:10:00,366
That means I'm only at one 198?

205
00:10:00,534 --> 00:10:04,321
That only means that you're half
a percent less gross than we thought.

206
00:10:04,797 --> 00:10:07,624
I'm seducing
a Czech supermodel in two hours.

207
00:10:07,749 --> 00:10:10,040
I can't squander that on 199.

208
00:10:11,978 --> 00:10:14,089
Petra has to be 200.

209
00:10:14,176 --> 00:10:16,595
What are you gonna do? It's not
like you're gonna find someone new

210
00:10:16,613 --> 00:10:18,800
to have sex with
in the next two hours.

211
00:10:19,517 --> 00:10:21,569
Hi, millionaire astronaut.
Want to come back to my place

212
00:10:21,570 --> 00:10:23,188
- and see some moon shells?
- Go away.

213
00:10:23,526 --> 00:10:26,635
I just got back from my wife's grave.
Put her in the ground a year ago today.

214
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:28,643
Man, I miss her.
I sure could use some comfort.

215
00:10:28,857 --> 00:10:29,978
You're creepy.

216
00:10:30,146 --> 00:10:32,860
Man, aren't you sick of all the games?
I just want to settle down

217
00:10:32,985 --> 00:10:35,171
and have a gaggle
of rug rats, like, right now.

218
00:10:35,296 --> 00:10:37,901
I have Mace, and I enjoy using it.

219
00:10:41,923 --> 00:10:45,050
Knowing how important this is to me,
do you think Lily would even consider...

220
00:10:45,175 --> 00:10:47,538
- By the way, I would do all the work...
- I will end your life.

221
00:10:47,707 --> 00:10:48,507
Right.

222
00:10:55,126 --> 00:10:57,185
Where'd Barney go?
It's been over an hour.

223
00:10:57,354 --> 00:10:59,564
You know,
looking over the names on this list,

224
00:10:59,689 --> 00:11:02,192
I'm not sensing a lot
of ethnic diversity.

225
00:11:02,317 --> 00:11:04,276
He should really look
at that in himself.

226
00:11:07,632 --> 00:11:08,697
All done.

227
00:11:09,069 --> 00:11:11,319
199 down, one more to go.

228
00:11:11,444 --> 00:11:13,064
You done with your drink?

229
00:11:15,552 --> 00:11:16,923
There's the stuff.

230
00:11:18,821 --> 00:11:20,572
What the hell happened to you?

231
00:11:20,697 --> 00:11:23,079
So, there's this girl at my gym...

232
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:25,797
Pauline... she's been
after me for some time.

233
00:11:26,010 --> 00:11:28,967
- Why'd you wait until now?
- She's not exactly my type.

234
00:11:29,538 --> 00:11:31,386
Looking good, Pauline.

235
00:11:31,554 --> 00:11:32,822
You are gonna rip it up

236
00:11:32,947 --> 00:11:36,155
at the Women's Pumping Iron
Classic in Sarasota this fall.

237
00:11:41,719 --> 00:11:44,292
I was thinking about you and me

238
00:11:45,713 --> 00:11:48,238
and if you're still interested...

239
00:11:49,072 --> 00:11:52,658
- Okay, blondie, time for Mama's cardio!
- Geez! Mommy!

240
00:11:53,377 --> 00:11:54,454
Every inch of her

241
00:11:54,579 --> 00:11:56,750
tasted like roast beef and creatine.

242
00:11:59,166 --> 00:12:00,316
But I did it.

243
00:12:00,518 --> 00:12:03,767
I did it and I still have 30 minutes
before I'm supposed to meet Petra.

244
00:12:03,892 --> 00:12:05,747
Robin, do you have
any concealer handy?

245
00:12:05,872 --> 00:12:08,423
I'd really like to cover up
some bruises and razor burn.

246
00:12:11,231 --> 00:12:13,970
- I hate to break this to you, but...
- What?

247
00:12:14,397 --> 00:12:17,397
Well, you did count
Gaby Allan twice,

248
00:12:17,522 --> 00:12:21,509
but... you also went
from 138 to 138.

249
00:12:21,634 --> 00:12:23,021
You used the same number twice.

250
00:12:23,684 --> 00:12:24,942
Wait, so, that means...

251
00:12:25,534 --> 00:12:28,186
Pauline wasn't 199, Pauline was 200?

252
00:12:28,770 --> 00:12:29,903
Congratulations!

253
00:12:31,031 --> 00:12:33,227
No... That was supposed to be Petra!

254
00:12:33,352 --> 00:12:35,131
Petra was supposed to be 200!

255
00:12:35,535 --> 00:12:38,778
Gorgeous, feminine, "Doesn't wear
a weight belt in bed," Petra!

256
00:12:38,956 --> 00:12:41,601
Hey, come on.
You made it to 200.

257
00:12:42,041 --> 00:12:43,277
You should be proud.

258
00:12:43,529 --> 00:12:46,211
You should be tested,
but you should be proud.

259
00:12:46,715 --> 00:12:49,673
Who cares if Pauline doesn't
pose for bikini pictures in magazines?

260
00:12:50,090 --> 00:12:51,219
Actually, she does.

261
00:12:51,344 --> 00:12:54,177
She's gonna be in next week's
issue of <i>Muscle Sexxy</i>.

262
00:12:54,344 --> 00:12:56,592
And like many of the ladies
in that magazine,

263
00:12:56,717 --> 00:12:59,000
Sexxy has two X's and one Y.

264
00:13:01,783 --> 00:13:03,534
<i>And so, on my way to get a bagel,</i>

265
00:13:03,659 --> 00:13:05,659
<i>I stopped at a newsstand
for a full minute</i>

266
00:13:05,784 --> 00:13:08,045
<i>to check out a picture
of Barney's 200th.</i>

267
00:13:09,849 --> 00:13:10,986
<i>If I hadn't done that,</i>

268
00:13:11,158 --> 00:13:13,071
<i>I would've walked right
by the newsstand,</i>

269
00:13:13,239 --> 00:13:16,198
<i>cut down 77th and gotten to
that corner a minute early.</i>

270
00:13:16,473 --> 00:13:18,956
<i>I would've gotten the bagel,
done some work,</i>

271
00:13:19,579 --> 00:13:21,455
<i>and you kids might
never have been born.</i>

272
00:13:21,787 --> 00:13:23,460
<i>Now, why did I cut down 77th,</i>

273
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:26,399
<i>and give a dollar to the homeless guy?
Here's why.</i>

274
00:13:26,539 --> 00:13:29,337
<i>Back when Marshall first started working
at Goliath National Bank...</i>

275
00:13:31,306 --> 00:13:34,600
Fran, I don't mean to bother you
but I have a big presentation tomorrow

276
00:13:34,725 --> 00:13:38,278
and it would really help if I could get
like some charts and graphs made up.

277
00:13:38,415 --> 00:13:41,366
- Could you help me with that?
- This is the graphics department.

278
00:13:41,491 --> 00:13:44,146
We can make as many graphs,
as many charts in as many colors

279
00:13:44,271 --> 00:13:46,135
on as many kinds
of paper as you want.

280
00:13:53,168 --> 00:13:55,018
We are gonna have some fun.

281
00:13:55,365 --> 00:13:58,825
I've ranked the Presidents
in order of how dirty their names sound.

282
00:13:59,314 --> 00:14:00,929
One: Johnson.

283
00:14:01,278 --> 00:14:02,829
Two: Bush.

284
00:14:03,219 --> 00:14:04,860
Three: Harding.

285
00:14:04,985 --> 00:14:06,583
Four: Polk.

286
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:11,838
This circle represents
"People Who Are Breaking My Heart..."

287
00:14:12,495 --> 00:14:14,610
and this circle represents

288
00:14:14,735 --> 00:14:17,604
"People Who Are Shaking
My Confidence Daily."

289
00:14:18,237 --> 00:14:19,772
And where they overlap:

290
00:14:20,921 --> 00:14:21,921
Cecilia.

291
00:14:24,549 --> 00:14:27,729
This is a pie chart
describing my favorite bars.

292
00:14:30,984 --> 00:14:34,229
And this is a bar graph
describing my favorite pies.

293
00:14:41,554 --> 00:14:42,619
What's going on?

294
00:14:42,788 --> 00:14:44,057
Enough with the charts.

295
00:14:44,182 --> 00:14:45,432
And the graphs.

296
00:14:45,808 --> 00:14:48,708
Really any visual
representation of data.

297
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:51,495
I'm not an idiot.

298
00:14:53,368 --> 00:14:56,410
I know how you guys feel
about my charts and my graphs.

299
00:14:56,933 --> 00:14:59,621
As a matter of fact, I've made a chart
of your reaction to my charts.

300
00:14:59,746 --> 00:15:02,292
Let's take a look.
Yes, it is true,

301
00:15:02,682 --> 00:15:04,696
since Cecelia,
your interest in my charts

302
00:15:04,821 --> 00:15:06,371
has been steadily dropping.

303
00:15:06,496 --> 00:15:08,478
But based on recent trends,

304
00:15:08,603 --> 00:15:09,998
I have also made...

305
00:15:10,852 --> 00:15:12,566
A projection chart!

306
00:15:12,735 --> 00:15:15,314
And look...
huge spike in interest coming!

307
00:15:15,439 --> 00:15:17,787
And this isn't just
some dead cat bounce.

308
00:15:17,912 --> 00:15:21,283
This is big sustainable growth
over the long term.

309
00:15:21,452 --> 00:15:23,325
You're a big sustainable growth.

310
00:15:26,664 --> 00:15:29,194
So, I have prepared a few charts

311
00:15:29,626 --> 00:15:33,226
to demonstrate how setting up
a shell corporation in Bermuda

312
00:15:33,351 --> 00:15:35,547
could help minimize
our second quarter losses.

313
00:15:37,028 --> 00:15:38,466
And save you all some jail time.

314
00:15:40,271 --> 00:15:41,682
To begin with...

315
00:15:46,835 --> 00:15:48,751
Could you just please excuse me?

316
00:15:53,885 --> 00:15:56,443
- Mosbius Designs.
- What the hell happened to my charts?

317
00:15:56,612 --> 00:15:58,444
- We threw them away.
- What?

318
00:15:58,696 --> 00:16:00,311
That's how an intervention works.

319
00:16:00,436 --> 00:16:03,074
You wouldn't stop using,
so, we flushed your stash.

320
00:16:03,243 --> 00:16:04,385
Come on, Ted!

321
00:16:04,510 --> 00:16:05,763
I need my charts, man!

322
00:16:05,888 --> 00:16:08,635
Just for today and then I promise
I will never ever use charts again.

323
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:11,374
I'm under at lot of pressure here.
I need my charts, Jack!

324
00:16:11,830 --> 00:16:14,085
My God, you're doing charts at work?

325
00:16:14,451 --> 00:16:17,417
They're for work, you idiot!
I'm giving a big presentation right now

326
00:16:17,542 --> 00:16:19,591
and if I don't have
those charts I'm gonna get fired!

327
00:16:20,558 --> 00:16:21,558
Crap.

328
00:16:21,885 --> 00:16:23,762
Stay right there.
I'll bring them to you.

329
00:16:23,930 --> 00:16:26,428
Hurry up! I'll try to think
of a way to stall them.

330
00:16:29,621 --> 00:16:31,816
I'm sorry but there's been
a little delay with the charts.

331
00:16:31,941 --> 00:16:34,949
But we will get started
in just a minute.

332
00:16:41,394 --> 00:16:42,864
Fish are weird, right?

333
00:16:43,772 --> 00:16:45,872
I mean what's up with fish?

334
00:16:51,972 --> 00:16:53,875
Charts! Get your charts here!

335
00:16:57,564 --> 00:17:00,382
Excuse me, Milt?
I think those are my charts.

336
00:17:01,211 --> 00:17:03,225
These charts?
On my blanket?

337
00:17:03,887 --> 00:17:06,338
That's also my blanket.
We'll get to that later.

338
00:17:06,463 --> 00:17:09,651
- But I really need these charts.
- Good, 'cause they're for sale.

339
00:17:10,184 --> 00:17:11,393
Fine, how much?

340
00:17:12,883 --> 00:17:13,979
One million dollars.

341
00:17:15,090 --> 00:17:17,315
- I'll give you five bucks.
- A million dollars.

342
00:17:18,026 --> 00:17:20,485
No one's gonna pay
a million dollars for these charts!

343
00:17:21,653 --> 00:17:23,113
One million dollars.

344
00:17:23,282 --> 00:17:24,782
Okay, Milt, you win.

345
00:17:26,229 --> 00:17:28,159
I'm gonna give you
one million dollars.

346
00:17:29,121 --> 00:17:30,319
Urinating...

347
00:17:30,821 --> 00:17:32,497
The problem is, the ATM...

348
00:17:32,666 --> 00:17:34,165
The alien time machine.

349
00:17:34,530 --> 00:17:37,968
The alien time machine
has a withdrawal limit.

350
00:17:38,093 --> 00:17:41,116
So, here's what I'm gonna do.
I'm gonna give you one dollar

351
00:17:41,329 --> 00:17:42,329
a day

352
00:17:42,684 --> 00:17:44,487
for a million days.

353
00:17:45,934 --> 00:17:46,934
That's...

354
00:17:47,704 --> 00:17:49,389
That's 2700 years.

355
00:17:50,774 --> 00:17:51,641
Deal!

356
00:17:54,979 --> 00:17:55,979
Sucker.

357
00:17:56,731 --> 00:18:00,057
I'm sorry, is there a land bass
I don't know about?

358
00:18:04,118 --> 00:18:05,144
Let's get started.

359
00:18:05,269 --> 00:18:07,866
<i>And so, if I hadn't bought
those charts back for Marshall,</i>

360
00:18:08,035 --> 00:18:09,644
<i>I wouldn't have had to cut down 77th</i>

361
00:18:09,769 --> 00:18:11,272
<i>to give Milt his daily dollar</i>

362
00:18:11,397 --> 00:18:13,380
<i>and well, you know the rest.</i>

363
00:18:14,207 --> 00:18:16,480
<i>So, there you have it, kids.
There's a lot of little reasons</i>

364
00:18:16,605 --> 00:18:18,647
<i>why the big things
in our lives happen.</i>

365
00:18:18,772 --> 00:18:21,401
<i>If I had known then where
all those little things were leading me,</i>

366
00:18:21,526 --> 00:18:23,653
<i>and how grateful
I'd be to get there,</i>

367
00:18:23,778 --> 00:18:26,393
<i>well, I probably
would've done something</i>

368
00:18:27,029 --> 00:18:28,029
<i>like this.</i>

369
00:19:07,536 --> 00:19:10,970
<i>Because somehow, I ended up
in the right place at the right time.</i>

370
00:19:11,472 --> 00:19:12,822
<i>And, as a result,</i>

371
00:19:13,516 --> 00:19:15,225
<i>my life would never be the same.</i>

372
00:19:30,941 --> 00:19:33,836
<i>The next day, Uncle Barney
finally confronted Matthew Panning,</i>

373
00:19:33,961 --> 00:19:35,953
<i>the stud of Port Richmond
Middle School.</i>

374
00:19:36,078 --> 00:19:38,877
So, Barney, great to hear
from you after all this time.

375
00:19:39,002 --> 00:19:42,110
- What's been going on?
- I've had sex with 200 women.

376
00:19:44,798 --> 00:19:45,766
God!

377
00:19:45,891 --> 00:19:47,203
That's way too many.

378
00:19:47,328 --> 00:19:49,117
I mean, that's just gross.

379
00:19:49,509 --> 00:19:51,360
Have you sought counseling
for sex addiction?

380
00:19:51,485 --> 00:19:53,079
Because you're a prime candidate.

381
00:19:53,269 --> 00:19:55,539
Have you sought counseling
for I win you lose?

382
00:19:56,334 --> 00:19:58,000
Yeah, suddenly those 100 girls

383
00:19:58,125 --> 00:20:00,962
you nailed in the seventh grade
aren't so impressive.

384
00:20:01,269 --> 00:20:02,269
100 girls?

385
00:20:02,707 --> 00:20:05,133
Is that what this is about?
Barney, I lied.

386
00:20:05,708 --> 00:20:06,834
Sure you did.

387
00:20:07,178 --> 00:20:09,201
I was 12... of course I was lying.

388
00:20:09,703 --> 00:20:11,431
I didn't have a pet Ewok either.

389
00:20:11,772 --> 00:20:12,807
Sure you didn't.

390
00:20:13,710 --> 00:20:16,434
Your whole adult life
has been built around...

391
00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:19,189
something I lied about
when I was 12?

392
00:20:20,024 --> 00:20:20,899
Jealous?

393
00:20:21,428 --> 00:20:23,860
Look, I gotta go pick
my kids up at school.

394
00:20:24,274 --> 00:20:26,607
It sounds like you got
a lot of problems.

395
00:20:26,907 --> 00:20:28,402
Good luck, I guess.

396
00:20:30,542 --> 00:20:31,828
I'm awesome.

397
00:20:34,870 --> 00:20:35,969
200.

398
00:20:37,719 --> 00:20:38,729
Now what?
