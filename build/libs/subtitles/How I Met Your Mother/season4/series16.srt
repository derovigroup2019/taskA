1
00:00:01,231 --> 00:00:04,893
<i>Back in 2009, your Aunt Robin
got a job hosting a morning show.</i>

2
00:00:05,001 --> 00:00:07,731
<i>Which meant she had to get up
kind of early. How early?</i>

3
00:00:10,071 --> 00:00:11,129
Morning, everybody.

4
00:00:11,239 --> 00:00:13,332
- Hey!
Hey, Robin!

5
00:00:13,442 --> 00:00:17,468
So you're actually doing it, huh?
You're actually going to work at 2:00 a. m.

6
00:00:17,578 --> 00:00:20,478
Okay, I'm not doing it for me.
I'm doing it for the fans.

7
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:24,038
Who exactly are the fans of a show
that airs at 4:00 in the morning?

8
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:26,379
People getting up to host a show
at 5:00 in the morning?

9
00:00:26,485 --> 00:00:27,509
Ha, ha, ha.

10
00:00:27,619 --> 00:00:29,678
Meth addicts
who haven't sold their TVs yet?

11
00:00:29,788 --> 00:00:32,312
Strippers in that messy gray area
between getting off work

12
00:00:32,423 --> 00:00:34,391
and getting their kids up for school?

13
00:00:34,492 --> 00:00:35,857
Them's my peeps.

14
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:38,393
All right, catch me up.
What's been going on?

15
00:00:38,495 --> 00:00:40,725
You know, just the uzhe.

16
00:00:40,831 --> 00:00:42,821
- Really, the uzhe?
- Yes.

17
00:00:42,932 --> 00:00:46,299
Robin, think of the funniest thing
that has ever happened.

18
00:00:46,402 --> 00:00:48,995
- Got it.
- Now double that.

19
00:00:49,103 --> 00:00:51,594
So, a chimpanzee wearing two tuxedos?

20
00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:56,701
Something even funnier than that
happened to Marshall today.

21
00:00:56,810 --> 00:00:59,277
Okay, first of all,
there's nothing funnier than that.

22
00:00:59,378 --> 00:01:02,905
Second of all, look,
it's not that good a story.

23
00:01:03,015 --> 00:01:04,413
Oh, come on, you guys.

24
00:01:04,516 --> 00:01:08,815
You're four young, active people living
in the most exciting city on Earth.

25
00:01:08,919 --> 00:01:10,511
You're telling me
you have no stories for me?

26
00:01:10,621 --> 00:01:12,953
What can I say?
Some weeks are just like that.

27
00:01:13,057 --> 00:01:17,550
It's the same thing over and over.
A kid in my class ate some paste.

28
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:21,959
I used deceitful means to hook up
with a less-than-intelligent girl.

29
00:01:22,064 --> 00:01:25,590
My ex-girlfriend, Karen, moved to town.
It's just... It's all the same, Robin.

30
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:27,292
Karen's in town?

31
00:01:27,401 --> 00:01:29,494
- You have got to be kidding me!
- No!

32
00:01:29,604 --> 00:01:31,594
<i>Kids,
I think I've told you about Karen.</i>

33
00:01:32,305 --> 00:01:35,671
<i>She was my girlfriend in high school
and intermittently during college.</i>

34
00:01:35,774 --> 00:01:39,574
<i>She was beautiful, smart.
I was madly in love with her.</i>

35
00:01:39,678 --> 00:01:42,976
<i>The only problem was,
Marshall and Lily were not.</i>

36
00:01:43,081 --> 00:01:46,141
<i>I think it had something to do with
every time Karen opened her mouth.</i>

37
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:49,981
I love that you guys live in a dorm.
It's so American.

38
00:01:50,087 --> 00:01:53,522
It's like, "Let's all eat baloney sandwiches
and be racist. "

39
00:01:55,391 --> 00:01:57,483
Oh, my God, she was such a douche.

40
00:01:57,592 --> 00:01:59,958
Dude, she was the heiress
to the Massengill fortune.

41
00:02:01,162 --> 00:02:04,392
- She really wasn't that bad.
- Of course, you think that.

42
00:02:04,498 --> 00:02:07,296
She turned you into
one of her douche zombies.

43
00:02:07,401 --> 00:02:13,429
"I want to eat your brain,
but only if it's organic and grass-fed. "

44
00:02:14,406 --> 00:02:15,464
What?

45
00:02:15,974 --> 00:02:18,737
- Will you pass the salt?
- Salt?

46
00:02:19,844 --> 00:02:21,368
So bourgeois.

47
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:23,711
Totally.

48
00:02:26,816 --> 00:02:30,876
- What's that thing?
- That's a TV, Karen.

49
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:32,344
Oh.

50
00:02:32,855 --> 00:02:34,584
I don't watch TV.

51
00:02:35,390 --> 00:02:36,652
Totally.

52
00:02:37,926 --> 00:02:41,122
You thought I actually bought tickets
to WrestleMania?

53
00:02:41,228 --> 00:02:43,526
I was being ironic.

54
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:45,359
Totally.

55
00:02:45,464 --> 00:02:49,195
I know that you were being ironic.

56
00:02:51,136 --> 00:02:53,866
I, too, am being ironic.

57
00:02:54,573 --> 00:02:56,631
Let's do this!

58
00:02:58,776 --> 00:02:59,868
What?

59
00:03:00,344 --> 00:03:04,143
That makeup didn't come off for a month.
I had to meet Lily's parents that way.

60
00:03:04,247 --> 00:03:05,714
I've never looked like a bigger jackass.

61
00:03:05,815 --> 00:03:07,008
Until today.

62
00:03:07,115 --> 00:03:09,174
Tell the story. Tell the story.
Tell the story.

63
00:03:09,284 --> 00:03:10,410
Just let it go!

64
00:03:10,519 --> 00:03:12,884
Well, hold on. Is it really funny?

65
00:03:12,987 --> 00:03:15,387
Robin, I am not kidding you.

66
00:03:15,489 --> 00:03:21,120
I almost don't want you to hear it,
because seriously, for the rest of your life,

67
00:03:21,227 --> 00:03:25,185
nothing else will ever be as funny,
and you will curse yourself

68
00:03:25,297 --> 00:03:28,357
for agreeing to ever hear it
in the first place.

69
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:31,091
But seriously, you got to hear it.
It's so funny.

70
00:03:31,269 --> 00:03:32,861
Fine.

71
00:03:33,404 --> 00:03:36,065
<i>I was at the company gym
this morning playing basketball.</i>

72
00:03:36,173 --> 00:03:39,630
<i>Now, the guys I work with
can be pretty brutal with their ridicule.</i>

73
00:03:39,742 --> 00:03:43,200
Hey, look at Wisniewski.
He's gonna cry. Look at him.

74
00:03:43,312 --> 00:03:44,972
Yeah, look at him.

75
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:47,571
I don't know. I don't think knees
are supposed to bend that way.

76
00:03:47,682 --> 00:03:49,673
I think he might have torn his ACL.

77
00:03:49,784 --> 00:03:53,116
Bro, the only thing that guy tore
was his cervix or maybe his hymen.

78
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:55,687
Yeah, or his Fallopian tubes. Boom!

79
00:03:58,324 --> 00:04:00,656
I may have cleaned up the dialog
a little bit.

80
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:04,456
Anyways, I go to my duffle bag
to get out my work clothes...

81
00:04:04,563 --> 00:04:07,759
Wait, wait, wait, wait. I want to say it.
I want to say it. I want to say it.

82
00:04:07,865 --> 00:04:09,526
Fine. You say it.

83
00:04:09,634 --> 00:04:13,660
Marshall goes to his duffle bag
to get out his work clothes and...

84
00:04:13,770 --> 00:04:16,671
No, no, no, you say it.
It's funnier if you say it.

85
00:04:16,773 --> 00:04:20,469
No, let me say it. No, no, you say it.
You say it. Say it.

86
00:04:21,677 --> 00:04:23,007
Same time.

87
00:04:23,611 --> 00:04:25,738
No, no, no, you go. You go.

88
00:04:26,648 --> 00:04:28,740
- I forgot...
- Marshall forgot his pants!

89
00:04:38,290 --> 00:04:40,223
He forgot his pants.

90
00:04:57,139 --> 00:05:00,539
Okay, Marshall forgot his pants.
That's pretty funny.

91
00:05:00,641 --> 00:05:03,405
It's no chimpanzee wearing two tuxedos.

92
00:05:03,511 --> 00:05:07,173
I mean, what did he...
He forgot he put the first one on?

93
00:05:08,181 --> 00:05:10,081
Stupid monkey.

94
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:14,413
So Karen in New York. Weird, right?

95
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:16,953
Ted, you cannot get back together
with Karen.

96
00:05:17,055 --> 00:05:19,250
I never said I was going to
get back together with her.

97
00:05:19,357 --> 00:05:20,756
But I was thinking, she's new in town.

98
00:05:20,858 --> 00:05:22,722
Would it be the worst thing
in the world if I gave her a call?

99
00:05:22,826 --> 00:05:24,953
No, no, Ted, it wouldn't be
the worst thing in the world.

100
00:05:25,062 --> 00:05:26,529
It would be the fourth worst thing.

101
00:05:26,630 --> 00:05:29,757
Number one, super volcano.
Number two, an asteroid hits the Earth.

102
00:05:29,865 --> 00:05:34,267
Number three, all footage of Evel Knievel
is lost. Number four, Ted calls Karen.

103
00:05:34,369 --> 00:05:36,269
Number five, Lily gets eaten by a shark.

104
00:05:36,371 --> 00:05:39,771
I'm Lily and I approve the order of that list.

105
00:05:39,873 --> 00:05:41,602
You don't know the whole story.

106
00:05:41,709 --> 00:05:46,304
Ted and Karen were off-and-on all through
college, and it always went the same way.

107
00:05:46,412 --> 00:05:49,312
They'd be having fun, douching it up,
and then one day...

108
00:05:50,182 --> 00:05:54,049
I know you think pepperoni is fascist,
and you're totally right, so I...

109
00:05:54,151 --> 00:05:56,085
Oh, my God! Karen!

110
00:05:57,388 --> 00:05:58,821
Sorry, bro.

111
00:05:59,556 --> 00:06:00,887
Before you say anything,

112
00:06:00,990 --> 00:06:04,891
<i>I think that you should read
Baudelaire's Les Fleurs du Mal.</i>

113
00:06:07,096 --> 00:06:08,324
Okay.

114
00:06:09,998 --> 00:06:11,055
So then they break up.

115
00:06:11,165 --> 00:06:14,430
Ted would be all depressed and we would
wait the appropriate amount of time

116
00:06:14,535 --> 00:06:16,399
and then we would tell him
how we really felt.

117
00:06:17,237 --> 00:06:18,329
Karen and I broke up.

118
00:06:18,438 --> 00:06:20,871
- We hated her!
- Bitch had to go!

119
00:06:21,974 --> 00:06:23,965
And then Ted would
build up a head of steam

120
00:06:24,076 --> 00:06:28,375
and finally take the bus to Providence
to give Karen a piece of his mind.

121
00:06:29,614 --> 00:06:31,638
- How'd it go?
- Great.

122
00:06:32,549 --> 00:06:34,244
Look who's back!

123
00:06:35,119 --> 00:06:37,052
- Karen!
- Karen!

124
00:06:38,187 --> 00:06:42,283
And then, sure enough, the whole thing
would start all over again.

125
00:06:43,191 --> 00:06:47,854
Make that 10,002 Maniacs,
because I got us Natalie Merchant...

126
00:06:49,830 --> 00:06:51,263
Sorry, bro.

127
00:06:52,533 --> 00:06:55,365
So she would come visit you at school
and the second you turned your back,

128
00:06:55,468 --> 00:06:57,936
she would bring guys
back to your dorm room?

129
00:06:58,037 --> 00:06:59,196
Respect.

130
00:06:59,304 --> 00:07:01,101
Okay, I was an idiot.

131
00:07:01,206 --> 00:07:03,697
She was my first real girlfriend.
I was madly in love with her.

132
00:07:03,809 --> 00:07:06,436
We all did stuff we regret in college.

133
00:07:06,544 --> 00:07:09,876
Junior year, Marshall grew
a soul patch, wore a Rasta hat,

134
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:12,448
and asked everyone
to call him M.J. Smooth.

135
00:07:12,549 --> 00:07:14,846
I don't regret that for one second.

136
00:07:15,518 --> 00:07:17,748
So you guys absolutely
don't think I should call her?

137
00:07:17,853 --> 00:07:18,820
Ted, no!
- Of course not!

138
00:07:18,921 --> 00:07:19,910
Get it through your thick skull!

139
00:07:20,021 --> 00:07:22,114
Okay, okay, fine, I won't.

140
00:07:22,957 --> 00:07:25,357
Interesting piece of trivia, I called her.

141
00:07:25,459 --> 00:07:26,790
- What are you doing?
- You idiot!

142
00:07:26,894 --> 00:07:28,122
Finish the pants story.

143
00:07:28,228 --> 00:07:30,162
I can't believe you called her.

144
00:07:30,264 --> 00:07:32,629
Why don't you just ask her to lunch
while you're at it?

145
00:07:32,732 --> 00:07:37,566
Because, Lily, I'm not going
to ask her out to lunch, again.

146
00:07:38,136 --> 00:07:40,969
- Wow.
- You asked her to lunch?

147
00:07:41,439 --> 00:07:44,999
Why would anyone want
to have lunch with their ex?

148
00:07:45,109 --> 00:07:46,133
Glad you asked, Marshall.

149
00:07:46,243 --> 00:07:48,710
There are four possible motives
behind an ex lunch.

150
00:07:48,812 --> 00:07:51,303
Number one, they want
to get back together.

151
00:07:51,414 --> 00:07:53,847
Oh. Like my high school boyfriend, Scooter.

152
00:07:54,950 --> 00:07:59,181
Lilies, clever.
I'm sorry I don't have a scooter for you.

153
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:03,683
My God, that's funny!
I forgot how funny you are.

154
00:08:05,192 --> 00:08:08,627
- Where is that waiter?
- Why? You like waiters?

155
00:08:08,727 --> 00:08:10,752
I can be a waiter.

156
00:08:10,863 --> 00:08:15,492
I'm going to be the greatest waiter
on this Earth, and then you'll love me.

157
00:08:16,334 --> 00:08:20,326
Number two, they want to kill you.
Like when I had lunch with Wendy.

158
00:08:21,004 --> 00:08:23,165
I'm glad we could finally do this.

159
00:08:23,273 --> 00:08:25,604
You know, after the ninth time
you rescheduled on me,

160
00:08:25,708 --> 00:08:27,141
I almost gave up on you.

161
00:08:27,243 --> 00:08:30,336
But you didn't. You just kept on trying.

162
00:08:31,213 --> 00:08:35,478
By the way, there's something
I've been meaning to give you.

163
00:08:38,886 --> 00:08:40,853
Gun! She's got a gun!

164
00:08:43,223 --> 00:08:44,520
It's a tie.

165
00:08:45,258 --> 00:08:48,454
Number three, they actually do want
to give you your stuff back.

166
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:50,391
Like when I had lunch with Curt.

167
00:08:50,863 --> 00:08:54,696
By the way, there's something
I've been meaning to give you.

168
00:08:59,402 --> 00:09:03,997
My snub-nose. 38 Police Special!
God, I knew I left that somewhere.

169
00:09:04,406 --> 00:09:08,034
Every time I watch the news,
I'm like, "Oops. Hope that wasn't my gun. "

170
00:09:10,078 --> 00:09:12,069
Breaking up was the right choice.

171
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:17,373
Or number four, to rub your face
in how great they're doing.

172
00:09:17,484 --> 00:09:19,951
Like my lunch with Nicole Barsamian.

173
00:09:20,052 --> 00:09:22,384
- Who's Nicole Barsamian?
- My ex.

174
00:09:23,522 --> 00:09:26,581
- Hello, Nicole.
- You look well, Marshall.

175
00:09:26,691 --> 00:09:28,659
You look okay, I guess.

176
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:32,595
- I'm seeing someone.
- Already? Who?

177
00:09:32,696 --> 00:09:35,755
Lee Roberts. He reads at a fifth-grade level.

178
00:09:39,836 --> 00:09:41,735
You have to cancel the lunch.

179
00:09:41,837 --> 00:09:45,863
I would definitely do that, definitely,
except I already had it.

180
00:09:47,241 --> 00:09:50,506
Robin, I'm going to need to
borrow the butt of your gun.

181
00:09:50,611 --> 00:09:53,636
I actually lost it again.
Can you believe that?

182
00:09:59,385 --> 00:10:01,750
How could you break bread
with that woman?

183
00:10:01,853 --> 00:10:05,448
It was just lunch,
and you know she doesn't eat wheat.

184
00:10:05,556 --> 00:10:06,784
We had a great time catching up.

185
00:10:06,890 --> 00:10:10,291
I mean, we even laughed about
what jerks we were back then.

186
00:10:11,662 --> 00:10:14,255
I can't believe I had a beret
for each day of the week.

187
00:10:14,363 --> 00:10:18,799
I can't believe I had an iron-on image
of Moli?re on my backpack.

188
00:10:19,401 --> 00:10:21,631
Man, we were pretentious.

189
00:10:21,736 --> 00:10:23,965
So pretentious.

190
00:10:24,071 --> 00:10:25,766
What can I get you?

191
00:10:25,873 --> 00:10:26,931
Hi.

192
00:10:28,741 --> 00:10:32,837
I don't want to cause a scene, but
your wine list has a Ch?teauneuf-du-Pape

193
00:10:32,946 --> 00:10:35,311
listed under your C?tes de Provence.

194
00:10:35,414 --> 00:10:38,178
You might want to alert your sommelier.

195
00:10:38,283 --> 00:10:39,943
And for you?

196
00:10:40,051 --> 00:10:44,919
I hate to go off-menu, but can we have
some bruschett with fresh mozzarell?

197
00:10:48,191 --> 00:10:49,681
It was great. It was great.

198
00:10:49,793 --> 00:10:52,283
I mean, there was one weird moment
towards the end.

199
00:10:52,394 --> 00:10:54,658
Yeah, I mean, how do you say goodbye
in those situations?

200
00:10:54,763 --> 00:10:57,822
A kiss on the cheek is too familiar.
A handshake is too formal.

201
00:10:57,932 --> 00:11:01,059
And a hug is just like a public dry hump.

202
00:11:02,169 --> 00:11:04,399
I think you're hugging wrong.

203
00:11:05,005 --> 00:11:06,801
- So what happened?
- Well...

204
00:11:07,039 --> 00:11:11,203
Schopenhauer made a saucy little
argument in which he posited...

205
00:11:13,011 --> 00:11:16,208
Ted, honey, I want you to go outside
and bite the curb. I'll be out in a minute.

206
00:11:16,314 --> 00:11:19,908
Hey, Karen was the first girl I ever loved.
Okay?

207
00:11:20,017 --> 00:11:22,576
And after the year I've had, I...
I don't know,

208
00:11:22,685 --> 00:11:25,882
I guess having lunch with her just
reminded me of what it was like to be 18

209
00:11:25,989 --> 00:11:28,513
and have my whole life figured out.

210
00:11:28,623 --> 00:11:33,252
And I would like to remind everyone that
at least I was wearing pants, Marshall.

211
00:11:33,361 --> 00:11:37,024
No! No, no, no! You can't just go
changing the subject like that.

212
00:11:37,131 --> 00:11:38,791
Oh. Yeah, the pants story.

213
00:11:38,898 --> 00:11:41,526
Pants story, bomaye! Pants story, bomaye!

214
00:11:41,634 --> 00:11:42,760
There's no story!

215
00:11:42,869 --> 00:11:45,837
I had a little situation, so I called Lily.

216
00:11:45,938 --> 00:11:47,428
And just refresh us,
what was that situation?

217
00:11:47,539 --> 00:11:48,972
I forgot my pants.

218
00:11:50,808 --> 00:11:52,639
What do you mean you forgot your pants?

219
00:11:52,744 --> 00:11:55,769
I forgot them.
Now, I need you to bring me some.

220
00:11:56,179 --> 00:11:57,976
What about your spare pants?

221
00:11:58,081 --> 00:11:59,776
Last Thursday, the mustard incident?

222
00:11:59,883 --> 00:12:01,782
Jeez, woman, you have
the memory of a goldfish.

223
00:12:01,884 --> 00:12:06,786
No, Ted, you're not getting off that easy.
Marshall's pants story, while amusing...

224
00:12:06,888 --> 00:12:09,550
Amusing? Try very amusing.

225
00:12:09,657 --> 00:12:13,683
...is nothing compared to this
Karen madness. Finish your story.

226
00:12:13,794 --> 00:12:16,785
What? That's it.
It was just one kiss in the restaurant.

227
00:12:16,896 --> 00:12:21,128
Why did you say "in the restaurant"?
Did you kiss somewhere else?

228
00:12:21,234 --> 00:12:26,102
Like where, in a tree?
No, Lily, we did not make out in a tree.

229
00:12:26,204 --> 00:12:28,034
What's with this one?

230
00:12:28,472 --> 00:12:31,373
Oh, Ted. What did you do?

231
00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:40,080
Ted, how could you?

232
00:12:40,182 --> 00:12:43,446
Ted, Marshall forgot to bring
his pants to work today,

233
00:12:43,551 --> 00:12:46,315
and you're still the stupidest person
at this table.

234
00:12:46,421 --> 00:12:50,720
Okay, Lily, let's be honest.
We both know your real motivation here.

235
00:12:50,824 --> 00:12:53,917
You hate Karen because she lingered.

236
00:12:54,026 --> 00:12:56,119
You son of a bitch.

237
00:12:56,228 --> 00:12:57,559
What do you mean she lingered?

238
00:12:57,663 --> 00:13:01,826
February 5th, 1998. I was painting...

239
00:13:04,935 --> 00:13:08,166
Sorry. I... Sorry. I...

240
00:13:12,909 --> 00:13:16,867
You know, that color palette
is a bit derivative of early Van Gogh,

241
00:13:16,978 --> 00:13:18,673
don't you think?

242
00:13:21,415 --> 00:13:25,511
Cheat on Ted, criticize my painting,
whatever, that's your business.

243
00:13:25,619 --> 00:13:31,352
But I catch you peeping on my man's junk
and you linger?

244
00:13:31,457 --> 00:13:33,948
You gots to get got.

245
00:13:34,059 --> 00:13:36,925
The game is the game.

246
00:13:37,028 --> 00:13:39,895
In Karen's defense, I had just worked out.

247
00:13:40,498 --> 00:13:42,362
Why'd you have to paint
Marshall nude anyway?

248
00:13:42,466 --> 00:13:44,696
Because he ate my bowl of fruit.

249
00:13:44,801 --> 00:13:48,634
Look, the point is, Karen is a dirty lingerer,

250
00:13:48,737 --> 00:13:51,137
and you cannot bring her
back into our lives.

251
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:53,673
Relax, it was just that one night!

252
00:13:53,775 --> 00:13:55,709
And the next three after that.
And one morning.

253
00:13:56,911 --> 00:13:59,504
But at least
I had pants on, Marshall.

254
00:13:59,613 --> 00:14:00,978
Although, actually, I didn't.

255
00:14:01,081 --> 00:14:03,242
- Wait, this happened in our apartment?
- Mmm-hmm.

256
00:14:03,350 --> 00:14:04,338
Where was I?

257
00:14:04,450 --> 00:14:06,247
You know those sleeping pills
you're taking

258
00:14:06,352 --> 00:14:08,115
to keep on your crazy new schedule?

259
00:14:08,221 --> 00:14:09,847
I think they're stronger than you realize.

260
00:14:17,027 --> 00:14:19,621
LaFontaine gets the puck to Turgeon.

261
00:14:19,730 --> 00:14:23,028
Turgeon shoots. Glove save.

262
00:14:24,534 --> 00:14:28,629
Hey, Ted. Hey, Lily.
Don't worry. I won't tell Marshall.

263
00:14:30,506 --> 00:14:33,133
I'm gonna grab a beer. You want one?

264
00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:40,602
Beer! I'll start decanting the Bordeaux.

265
00:14:47,385 --> 00:14:49,910
Ted, sure it's fun to look back at a time

266
00:14:50,021 --> 00:14:53,683
when you were a fresh-faced farm girl
with a virgin's glow.

267
00:14:53,790 --> 00:14:58,783
But all that stuff, Ohio, Karen, college...
All that was BS.

268
00:14:58,895 --> 00:15:02,626
"Before Stinson. "
Now your life is awesome!

269
00:15:02,732 --> 00:15:06,895
I mean, yeah, you still live with
your ex-girlfriend, which is ridiculous.

270
00:15:07,002 --> 00:15:09,799
Your Laser Tag chops
are almost nonexistent.

271
00:15:09,904 --> 00:15:15,273
And your wardrobe, it's like, what,
are you allergic to quality fabrics?

272
00:15:15,375 --> 00:15:17,502
Seriously, Ted, shape up.

273
00:15:18,912 --> 00:15:20,572
What were we talking about?

274
00:15:21,413 --> 00:15:22,880
So what's next with this broad?

275
00:15:22,981 --> 00:15:25,380
Oh, please, the story's already written.

276
00:15:25,516 --> 00:15:29,384
Ted is Charlie Brown trying to
kick the football and Karen's Lucy,

277
00:15:29,487 --> 00:15:32,614
who pulls it away at the last second
and has sex with it.

278
00:15:32,722 --> 00:15:33,711
Ew!

279
00:15:33,890 --> 00:15:36,551
You guys know what I mean.
Ted's gonna fall in love,

280
00:15:36,659 --> 00:15:39,787
and then Karen's gonna cheat on him
with some meathead, who's like,

281
00:15:41,029 --> 00:15:42,496
"Sorry, bro. "

282
00:15:43,865 --> 00:15:45,662
Wrong, wrong, wrong!

283
00:15:45,767 --> 00:15:47,791
You must have left the right answer
in your pants, Marshall,

284
00:15:47,901 --> 00:15:49,801
because that's exactly what didn't happen.

285
00:15:49,903 --> 00:15:51,494
<i>Because here's what happened.</i>

286
00:15:51,604 --> 00:15:54,368
<i>One afternoon, we were at Karen's place...</i>

287
00:15:54,740 --> 00:15:57,435
Karen? Oh, my God.

288
00:15:58,410 --> 00:15:59,968
How could you?

289
00:16:03,247 --> 00:16:04,737
Sorry, bro.

290
00:16:10,119 --> 00:16:12,519
<i>So, this time,
the meathead Karen was cheating with...</i>

291
00:16:12,622 --> 00:16:16,682
Was me, Ted. Me...

292
00:16:17,259 --> 00:16:18,953
Remember that time
Marshall forgot his pants?

293
00:16:19,060 --> 00:16:20,152
Damn it, Ted!

294
00:16:20,261 --> 00:16:23,424
You quit trying to change the subject.
You crossed the line.

295
00:16:23,531 --> 00:16:26,693
You are complicit
in breaking some poor guy's heart.

296
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:31,202
And you, you of all people
know exactly how that feels.

297
00:16:32,137 --> 00:16:33,968
You really don't want to tell
the pants story, do you?

298
00:16:34,073 --> 00:16:37,200
- What?
- Pants, pants, pants, pants...

299
00:16:37,308 --> 00:16:39,071
Fine! Okay?

300
00:16:39,177 --> 00:16:42,270
So, Lily came down to the office
to bring me my pants.

301
00:16:42,379 --> 00:16:44,677
- And why did she have to do that?
- Because I forgot my pants.

302
00:16:47,149 --> 00:16:50,550
- Lily, what are you doing here?
- I'm here to give Marshall something.

303
00:16:50,652 --> 00:16:51,641
Ah.

304
00:16:51,753 --> 00:16:55,382
Here to give him something. Got you. Nice.

305
00:16:55,490 --> 00:16:58,856
Yeah, but I'm in a hurry.
Can I just give it to you?

306
00:17:00,828 --> 00:17:02,260
Sure, okay.

307
00:17:03,029 --> 00:17:05,429
And then you'll give it to him?

308
00:17:05,531 --> 00:17:08,090
Wait, hey. I don't know about all that.

309
00:17:08,467 --> 00:17:11,231
I mean, yours would
have to be really good.

310
00:17:12,303 --> 00:17:14,771
- What are you talking about?
- What are you talking about?

311
00:17:14,872 --> 00:17:18,637
Marshall forgot his pants,
so I'm bringing him a new pair.

312
00:17:19,609 --> 00:17:21,873
Huh. Marshall forgot his pants.

313
00:17:21,978 --> 00:17:23,638
Well, it's a good thing that you came by

314
00:17:23,746 --> 00:17:26,977
because he has a really
important meeting today,

315
00:17:27,082 --> 00:17:30,949
and it would be pretty embarrassing
and not at all funny

316
00:17:31,052 --> 00:17:33,713
if he were to show up not wearing pants.

317
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:37,483
- So, I'll make sure he gets these.
- Great. Thanks, Barney.

318
00:17:39,225 --> 00:17:41,318
And you didn't give him his pants.

319
00:17:41,427 --> 00:17:43,452
Theodore Evelyn Mosby.

320
00:17:43,562 --> 00:17:47,861
Of course I gave him his pants.
I gave Lily my word. My word is oak.

321
00:17:48,767 --> 00:17:51,599
Though I did make some alterations.

322
00:17:58,041 --> 00:18:00,907
Now, as you'll see on page 44
of the contract...

323
00:18:01,009 --> 00:18:03,204
Hey, Eriksen, when did you join AC/DC?

324
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:07,274
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

325
00:18:07,815 --> 00:18:10,443
Now, can we please just turn
to page 44 of the contract?

326
00:18:10,551 --> 00:18:14,714
<i>Hey, Eriksen, I think the Oliver Twist
auditions are down the hall!</i>

327
00:18:17,456 --> 00:18:21,893
Hey, Eriksen, "Please, sir,
may I have some more pants?"

328
00:18:30,467 --> 00:18:32,332
More pants!

329
00:18:33,536 --> 00:18:34,935
Oh, my God!

330
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:40,704
That's it? That's the whole story?

331
00:18:40,809 --> 00:18:43,369
- So what happened with Karen?
- I'll finish it for you.

332
00:18:43,478 --> 00:18:48,039
Ted left without saying anything
and Karen got exactly what she wanted.

333
00:18:48,148 --> 00:18:49,205
Mmm-mmm.

334
00:18:49,315 --> 00:18:50,441
Not this time.

335
00:18:50,817 --> 00:18:53,183
So, you have a boyfriend?

336
00:18:53,286 --> 00:18:56,721
We've been drifting apart for a long time.
I've been meaning to break up with him.

337
00:18:56,822 --> 00:18:59,382
God, Karen, you are unbelievable.

338
00:18:59,491 --> 00:19:02,459
You don't have the guts to break up
with someone like a decent human being,

339
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:04,824
so instead you pull this crap.

340
00:19:06,363 --> 00:19:08,160
Okay, you're right.

341
00:19:09,432 --> 00:19:12,696
I'm great with books. I'm great with art.

342
00:19:14,169 --> 00:19:15,693
I'm great with identifying French wines

343
00:19:15,804 --> 00:19:19,034
from within a mile of
where the grapes are grown.

344
00:19:19,841 --> 00:19:22,206
But I'm really bad when it comes
to looking someone in the eye

345
00:19:22,309 --> 00:19:25,107
and telling them the truth
about how I feel.

346
00:19:25,212 --> 00:19:27,475
Well, we're both bad at that.

347
00:19:28,581 --> 00:19:32,017
But I think we both need to change.
So why don't I go first?

348
00:19:32,118 --> 00:19:35,883
Karen, you're a really hurtful
and reckless person,

349
00:19:35,987 --> 00:19:39,319
and I never want to see you
or speak to you again.

350
00:19:40,491 --> 00:19:41,719
<i>Au revoir.</i>

351
00:19:42,459 --> 00:19:43,823
Ted, wait.

352
00:19:47,597 --> 00:19:51,396
<i>Actually, "au revoir"means
"until we see each other again. "</i>

353
00:19:52,567 --> 00:19:57,503
So, I'm assuming that you mean
we will in fact see each other again?

354
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:02,430
Sorry, bro.

355
00:20:05,210 --> 00:20:06,700
- Thank you. Thank you.
- Yes!

356
00:20:06,812 --> 00:20:08,939
- Bravo.
- Ted, I am impressed with you.

357
00:20:09,047 --> 00:20:11,708
You, too, Marshall.
Have you been wearing those all day?

358
00:20:11,816 --> 00:20:14,148
They show off my calves.

359
00:20:14,252 --> 00:20:16,446
Pants story. Tell it again.

360
00:20:17,154 --> 00:20:20,555
You know, maybe it was good
you called Karen.

361
00:20:20,656 --> 00:20:23,648
It definitely was.
And not just for me, but for her, too.

362
00:20:23,759 --> 00:20:25,659
Later that night, she sat down with Jerry,

363
00:20:25,761 --> 00:20:28,752
and she had the break-up talk
she always avoided with me.

364
00:20:28,863 --> 00:20:29,989
<i>So you see, kids,</i>

365
00:20:30,098 --> 00:20:32,759
<i>sometimes when you
have to have a tough conversation,</i>

366
00:20:32,866 --> 00:20:33,833
<i>the best thing to do...</i>

367
00:20:33,934 --> 00:20:37,425
Wait a second. Wait a second.

368
00:20:37,537 --> 00:20:40,597
You said you were never gonna talk
to Karen again, right?

369
00:20:40,706 --> 00:20:41,764
Yeah.

370
00:20:41,874 --> 00:20:44,467
Then how do you know
she took your advice?

371
00:20:44,576 --> 00:20:45,600
Hmm?

372
00:20:45,944 --> 00:20:49,106
Oh! Right. Well, about that.

373
00:20:49,213 --> 00:20:51,408
After she broke up with that dude,
she called me, we went out,

374
00:20:51,515 --> 00:20:52,880
we hooked up,
and we've been dating ever since.

375
00:20:52,982 --> 00:20:54,040
We're really seeing eye-to-eye,
and this time,

376
00:20:54,150 --> 00:20:55,481
I don't know,
it just feels different somehow.

377
00:20:55,585 --> 00:20:58,110
Here she comes now. Be cool! Hey!

378
00:20:59,288 --> 00:21:01,051
Karen.
