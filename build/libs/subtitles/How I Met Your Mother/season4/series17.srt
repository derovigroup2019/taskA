00:00:01,509 --> 00:00:04,706
<i>In March of 2009, I'd been
dating my high school girlfriend Karen</i>

2
00:00:04,813 --> 00:00:05,905
<i>for a few weeks.</i>

3
00:00:06,014 --> 00:00:07,846
<i>My friends could not have
been less excited.</i>

4
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:10,418
- Hey, everybody.
Hello.

5
00:00:10,519 --> 00:00:12,009
Sorry, we can't stay long.

6
00:00:13,222 --> 00:00:14,712
- What a shame!
- That is sad!

7
00:00:14,824 --> 00:00:16,485
Hey, are those real diamond earrings?

8
00:00:16,592 --> 00:00:19,619
Yes. Yes, they are. Thank you.

9
00:00:19,730 --> 00:00:21,789
I didn't say I liked them.

10
00:00:21,899 --> 00:00:24,424
Oh, well, I got a great deal on them, so...

11
00:00:24,534 --> 00:00:27,299
Cool. I'm sure all the exploited
diamond miners in Sierra Leone

12
00:00:27,405 --> 00:00:30,203
would give you a high-five
if they still had all their fingers,

13
00:00:30,308 --> 00:00:32,242
but really pretty.

14
00:00:32,343 --> 00:00:34,004
Meet me upstairs.

15
00:00:34,145 --> 00:00:36,511
They only need one finger
to give her what I'm thinking.

16
00:00:36,614 --> 00:00:39,709
Yeah. Ted, Karen's a douche.

17
00:00:39,818 --> 00:00:41,410
Wow. Thanks for sugarcoating it.

18
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:43,215
"Douche" is sugarcoating it.

19
00:00:43,455 --> 00:00:47,391
Okay, believe it or not, my friends
do not get a vote on who I date.

20
00:00:47,493 --> 00:00:49,394
It's my life. I call the shots.

21
00:00:49,496 --> 00:00:51,828
- Ted, now!
- Yeah, coming!

22
00:00:52,699 --> 00:00:56,635
I don't know what Ted sees
in that horrible woman.

23
00:00:56,870 --> 00:00:59,237
I mean, yeah, she's got boobs, but...

24
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:00,807
I guess I get it.

25
00:01:00,908 --> 00:01:02,933
I think it's 'cause they met in high school.

26
00:01:03,044 --> 00:01:04,909
She was his first real girlfriend.

27
00:01:05,046 --> 00:01:06,911
We look at Karen and see a jerk.

28
00:01:07,014 --> 00:01:09,313
Ted looks at Karen and sees
the first person to touch his wiener

29
00:01:09,418 --> 00:01:12,285
besides himself,
his mom and his pediatrician.

30
00:01:12,387 --> 00:01:14,947
Okay, well, it's almost 2:00 a. m.
I better get ready for work.

31
00:01:15,057 --> 00:01:18,356
How can they call that thing
you're on a morning show?

32
00:01:18,460 --> 00:01:20,793
4:00 a. m. is still the middle of the night.

33
00:01:20,897 --> 00:01:22,387
I don't see how you do it.

34
00:01:22,498 --> 00:01:25,092
It's been almost a month. I'm used to it.

35
00:01:25,201 --> 00:01:27,032
Plus the show's not half bad, right?

36
00:01:27,136 --> 00:01:29,435
- Totally.
- We've never seen it.

37
00:01:29,974 --> 00:01:31,339
Have you guys ever watched it?

38
00:01:31,442 --> 00:01:33,137
- Of course!
- They've never seen it.

39
00:01:33,243 --> 00:01:34,870
Really? What is your favorite segment?

40
00:01:35,012 --> 00:01:36,070
- Weather.
- Never seen it.

41
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:38,011
- You guys have never seen my show?
- Sorry.

42
00:01:38,115 --> 00:01:40,607
- It's true.
- That's what I've been saying.

43
00:01:40,719 --> 00:01:44,155
Okay, yes, it's dull and generic
and we get spanked in the ratings

44
00:01:44,255 --> 00:01:47,986
by that Korean channel
that only shows Kim Jong II riding a horse,

45
00:01:48,093 --> 00:01:51,359
but, guys, it would mean so much to me
if just once

46
00:01:51,464 --> 00:01:54,297
I knew my friends were
out there watching.

47
00:01:55,368 --> 00:01:56,562
I'll tell you what,

48
00:01:56,669 --> 00:01:59,763
this Friday morning, everyone
can come to our place, 3:30 a. m.

49
00:01:59,872 --> 00:02:02,774
We'll all put on PJs.
We'll watch Robin's show.

50
00:02:03,443 --> 00:02:05,001
Aw, you guys are the best.

51
00:02:05,112 --> 00:02:06,409
We just want to support you.

52
00:02:07,047 --> 00:02:09,538
I just want to go to sleep.

53
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:12,815
I hate Robin for not being more successful.

54
00:02:13,621 --> 00:02:14,918
Hey, guys.

55
00:02:16,491 --> 00:02:19,858
Sad announcement.
Karen broke up with me.

56
00:02:22,598 --> 00:02:23,587
Go ahead.

57
00:02:23,699 --> 00:02:25,428
I knew you were listening! Yes!

58
00:02:41,485 --> 00:02:44,477
Hey, hey, we shouldn't be celebrating.

59
00:02:44,622 --> 00:02:47,386
Ted's just been through a bad breakup.

60
00:02:47,491 --> 00:02:50,085
Look, buddy, tell us everything.
Tell us what happened.

61
00:02:50,194 --> 00:02:52,186
Seriously, spare no details.

62
00:02:52,297 --> 00:02:56,233
What did she say?
What did you say? How did it feel?

63
00:02:56,601 --> 00:03:00,799
If you were to do it again,
all over, would you maybe...

64
00:03:02,341 --> 00:03:05,310
- How did it happen?
- It was the stupidest thing.

65
00:03:05,411 --> 00:03:09,211
I mean, we were just hanging out,
you know, being funny.

66
00:03:09,682 --> 00:03:12,150
You're the fan of 2002 Chiantis.

67
00:03:12,251 --> 00:03:15,847
Ew! No, you're the fan of 2002 Chiantis.

68
00:03:16,223 --> 00:03:18,316
Wait. What is this?

69
00:03:19,226 --> 00:03:22,320
Looks like one of Robin's earrings.
Huh! That's weird.

70
00:03:22,496 --> 00:03:24,931
- You're the fan...
- How did it get in your bed?

71
00:03:25,033 --> 00:03:26,432
I don't know.

72
00:03:26,568 --> 00:03:29,696
- Have you been sleeping with Robin?
- What? No, of course not!

73
00:03:29,804 --> 00:03:32,364
It probably got mixed in
with the laundry or something.

74
00:03:32,474 --> 00:03:33,772
Why should I believe you?

75
00:03:33,876 --> 00:03:36,777
Um, maybe because I've always been
faithful to you,

76
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:39,507
while you've cheated on me,
like, six times, bitch.

77
00:03:40,716 --> 00:03:41,705
- Snap!
- Cold-blooded!

78
00:03:41,817 --> 00:03:43,250
Right? Right?

79
00:03:43,954 --> 00:03:45,819
Yeah, I totally should have said that.

80
00:03:46,189 --> 00:03:47,417
Why should I believe you?

81
00:03:47,524 --> 00:03:53,019
Um, maybe because I've always been
faithful to you, while you...

82
00:03:53,965 --> 00:03:55,796
I love you.

83
00:03:56,467 --> 00:04:00,801
I knew this was a mistake.
That's it. It's over.

84
00:04:02,206 --> 00:04:04,801
And that was it. She left.

85
00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:08,846
What a story.
So brave of you to share that.

86
00:04:08,947 --> 00:04:13,680
Wait. Those are your pajamas?
You sleep in a pajama suit?

87
00:04:13,785 --> 00:04:16,118
Of course. What do you think I sleep in?

88
00:04:16,289 --> 00:04:17,586
A coffin.

89
00:04:18,057 --> 00:04:20,685
Dude, that doesn't look comfortable at all.

90
00:04:20,793 --> 00:04:24,821
- You're wearing a tie.
- First of all, it's a sleeping cravat.

91
00:04:25,166 --> 00:04:27,430
Second, it's not about comfort.

92
00:04:27,535 --> 00:04:29,867
It's about looking good all the time.

93
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:32,029
Why do you have to look good
all the time?

94
00:04:32,173 --> 00:04:34,141
Marshall, let me tell you a little story
about something

95
00:04:34,241 --> 00:04:35,539
that happened a couple of months back.

96
00:04:44,553 --> 00:04:47,421
Hi. We were just having
a "Who's hornier?" contest

97
00:04:47,523 --> 00:04:50,390
and we spilled massage oil
all over ourselves.

98
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:53,495
- Nice pajamas.
- Can we use your shower?

99
00:04:55,999 --> 00:04:58,593
That's not a memory.
That's from a porn movie.

100
00:04:58,702 --> 00:05:02,194
Not just any movie.
That's the exact scene from...

101
00:05:02,739 --> 00:05:06,608
- Never mind.
- The point is it could happen.

102
00:05:06,744 --> 00:05:10,578
And if it did, and I didn't look
my absolute best for those greasy sluts,

103
00:05:10,682 --> 00:05:12,149
I'd regret it forever.

104
00:05:13,451 --> 00:05:16,387
I'm sorry, dude, but that is just
the most ridiculous sleeping attire

105
00:05:16,488 --> 00:05:19,286
I've ever seen in my life. Anyway...

106
00:05:20,025 --> 00:05:23,461
Marshall's wearing a nightgown!
Marshall's wearing a nightgown!

107
00:05:23,562 --> 00:05:25,223
Hey, guys, you know how in the future
we're always saying,

108
00:05:25,331 --> 00:05:26,492
"Remember when
Marshall wore a nightgown?"

109
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:28,067
This is that time!

110
00:05:28,168 --> 00:05:29,157
It's a nightshirt.

111
00:05:29,269 --> 00:05:32,238
You can call it
a Ninja Star Danger Jock if you want,

112
00:05:32,339 --> 00:05:34,000
doesn't make you
any less of a cross-dresser.

113
00:05:34,107 --> 00:05:35,369
Whatever, dude. It's comfy.

114
00:05:35,475 --> 00:05:36,442
Uh-huh?
- Mmm-hmm.

115
00:05:36,576 --> 00:05:39,205
So, flying to Neverland
with Peter and Tink, was that amazing?

116
00:05:39,313 --> 00:05:40,712
Ooh! Let me go next!

117
00:05:40,815 --> 00:05:43,010
Was it nice to finally get out of
that crowded bed

118
00:05:43,117 --> 00:05:46,883
and take Charlie to the chocolate factory?
Ooh! Me, me, me, me!

119
00:05:46,988 --> 00:05:49,480
Something about Scrooge!

120
00:05:50,192 --> 00:05:52,353
Come on, guys. I'm carrying the team.

121
00:05:52,628 --> 00:05:55,290
I don't know.
I lived with Marshall for 12 years.

122
00:05:55,397 --> 00:05:58,663
Any time he's wearing
clothes at all, it's a victory.

123
00:06:01,004 --> 00:06:03,871
Ted, show's about to start!
- Be right there!

124
00:06:17,788 --> 00:06:19,848
<i>Good morning, New York. I'm...</i>

125
00:06:19,958 --> 00:06:21,789
- Hey!
- Whoa!

126
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:25,288
Marshall, I just found Robin's earring
on your dresser.

127
00:06:25,397 --> 00:06:27,661
Did you have something to do with
the other one being in my bed?

128
00:06:27,766 --> 00:06:29,598
- What are you talking about?
- You've always hated Karen.

129
00:06:29,702 --> 00:06:31,863
You've been telling me
to break up with her.

130
00:06:31,971 --> 00:06:35,429
You did it. You put the earring
in my bed so that Karen would find it.

131
00:06:35,541 --> 00:06:36,667
No, Ted! No! I would never...

132
00:06:36,776 --> 00:06:38,403
- Admit it!
- There's nothing to admit!

133
00:06:38,511 --> 00:06:40,343
Then why was Robin's earring
on your dresser?

134
00:06:40,447 --> 00:06:42,005
He was accessorizing!

135
00:06:42,115 --> 00:06:45,016
Marshall, I swear to God, if you
don't tell me the truth right now...

136
00:06:45,118 --> 00:06:48,087
Wait! Marshall didn't do it.

137
00:06:49,490 --> 00:06:50,650
I did.

138
00:06:51,092 --> 00:06:53,424
I broke you and Karen up.

139
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:02,468
You broke me and Karen up?
Are you insane?

140
00:07:02,571 --> 00:07:06,029
- What gives you the right to do that?
- Ted, I did it for your own good.

141
00:07:06,175 --> 00:07:09,269
You just weren't seeing
how awful she was.

142
00:07:09,378 --> 00:07:11,540
She failed the front porch test.

143
00:07:12,048 --> 00:07:13,743
What's the front porch test?

144
00:07:13,917 --> 00:07:17,717
Ted, you, me and Marshall have
been best friends since college.

145
00:07:17,821 --> 00:07:20,757
Think about how much
we all mean to each other.

146
00:07:20,858 --> 00:07:23,952
So when I picture the future,
I picture us all together.

147
00:07:24,628 --> 00:07:28,758
<i>How we'll all be retired, sipping tea
on the front porch of our beach house,</i>

148
00:07:28,866 --> 00:07:30,494
<i>playing bridge all day.</i>

149
00:07:30,602 --> 00:07:35,767
Okay, bridges are wild.
Four of a bridge beats a royal bridge.

150
00:07:35,941 --> 00:07:39,536
I see your bridge,
and I raise you three bridges.

151
00:07:39,644 --> 00:07:41,738
Bridge! I win!

152
00:07:42,215 --> 00:07:44,240
You have no idea
how to play bridge, do you?

153
00:07:44,350 --> 00:07:47,945
- We're gonna take a class.
- It's important to stay active.

154
00:07:48,121 --> 00:07:50,715
So whenever you've been dating
somebody for a while,

155
00:07:50,824 --> 00:07:52,883
I do the front porch test.

156
00:07:53,093 --> 00:07:56,995
You know, how is this person gonna
fit in with our group over the years?

157
00:07:57,097 --> 00:07:59,224
And when I think about Karen there...

158
00:07:59,566 --> 00:08:01,694
Bridge! I win!

159
00:08:01,836 --> 00:08:04,168
Fantastic. Another game of bridge.

160
00:08:04,372 --> 00:08:06,272
Don't read a book or anything.

161
00:08:06,441 --> 00:08:09,410
Look, dear, dolphins.

162
00:08:09,677 --> 00:08:10,974
They seem happy.

163
00:08:11,079 --> 00:08:13,708
I guess the chemical runoff
from this elitist beachfront property

164
00:08:13,816 --> 00:08:16,182
hasn't rotted out their blowholes yet.

165
00:08:16,285 --> 00:08:21,313
It will. That water will kill you.
It is a toxic deathtrap.

166
00:08:21,424 --> 00:08:24,292
- I'm gonna take a dip.
- I'll join you.

167
00:08:24,728 --> 00:08:27,788
Karen failed the front porch test.
She had to go.

168
00:08:27,998 --> 00:08:30,228
I can't believe you did that.

169
00:08:30,333 --> 00:08:33,599
Ted, think about how awesome
you, me and Marshall are.

170
00:08:33,704 --> 00:08:36,138
Seriously, think about it.

171
00:08:39,944 --> 00:08:42,276
- We're pretty awesome.
- We're totally awesome!

172
00:08:42,514 --> 00:08:46,746
So whoever you marry,
whoever joins Team Awesome,

173
00:08:46,985 --> 00:08:49,385
the bar is set pretty damn high.

174
00:08:49,855 --> 00:08:52,689
Look, I'm not saying
what I did was right, but...

175
00:08:52,792 --> 00:08:53,986
You're better off without her.

176
00:08:54,093 --> 00:08:56,823
And if Clarence the angel says it's true,
it must be true.

177
00:08:56,963 --> 00:08:59,329
Okay, you know what?
Fine, make your little jokes.

178
00:08:59,432 --> 00:09:00,990
Seriously, why would you wear
something like that?

179
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:03,831
- Lots of reasons.
- I bet you can't name five.

180
00:09:03,938 --> 00:09:05,872
One, no need to wear anything underneath.

181
00:09:05,973 --> 00:09:08,032
I can vouch for that.
Will you cross your legs, buddy?

182
00:09:08,175 --> 00:09:09,972
Two, sexy.

183
00:09:10,077 --> 00:09:13,536
I can vouch for that.
Will you uncross your legs, buddy?

184
00:09:14,015 --> 00:09:17,644
Three, my grandpa Olaf wore one,
and he lived to be 107.

185
00:09:17,752 --> 00:09:21,415
Four, no elastic waistband leaving
its judgmental pink teeth marks

186
00:09:21,523 --> 00:09:22,683
around my Thanksgiving belly.

187
00:09:22,791 --> 00:09:28,128
And five, every night
when I go to sleep, it's the freest,

188
00:09:28,331 --> 00:09:30,231
<i>most wonderful feeling in the world.</i>

189
00:09:30,333 --> 00:09:33,734
<i>I feel like I'm flying.</i>

190
00:09:39,176 --> 00:09:41,235
<i>So that's how I go to bed every night,</i>

191
00:09:41,645 --> 00:09:44,638
happy, weightless, with a heart full of joy.

192
00:09:44,749 --> 00:09:46,011
What about you?

193
00:09:47,252 --> 00:09:51,052
I have to lie perfectly still
so I don't wrinkle my suit-jamas.

194
00:09:52,123 --> 00:09:54,684
But at least I'm not wearing a dress.

195
00:09:55,761 --> 00:09:58,525
So, how mad are you?

196
00:09:58,631 --> 00:10:00,360
I don't know. I mean,

197
00:10:00,499 --> 00:10:03,525
I guess if you guys feel that strongly
about Karen,

198
00:10:03,636 --> 00:10:05,161
then maybe it was for the best.

199
00:10:05,272 --> 00:10:06,762
I really am sorry.

200
00:10:06,873 --> 00:10:10,365
I hated doing that again,
but Karen had to go.

201
00:10:11,344 --> 00:10:15,839
Again? Wait. How many times have
you broken me up with a girlfriend?

202
00:10:15,950 --> 00:10:17,747
Never! Six.

203
00:10:17,852 --> 00:10:20,582
- Like who?
- No one! Angie.

204
00:10:21,389 --> 00:10:23,254
Sophomore year.

205
00:10:23,357 --> 00:10:28,159
She was just using you to get back
at her ex, and you clearly didn't see it,

206
00:10:28,964 --> 00:10:31,762
<i>so one day when she was taking a nap...</i>

207
00:10:46,317 --> 00:10:48,012
Creed?

208
00:10:49,186 --> 00:10:51,916
Oh, my God, I have to break up with her.

209
00:10:52,990 --> 00:10:55,254
So that's where my Creed CD went.

210
00:10:55,826 --> 00:10:57,089
Who else?

211
00:10:57,195 --> 00:10:59,322
Remember that weird sci-fi girl

212
00:10:59,431 --> 00:11:02,423
who wanted you to propose after,
like, two months?

213
00:11:02,534 --> 00:11:06,231
You barely even liked her,
but you were still thinking about it, so...

214
00:11:08,941 --> 00:11:13,241
<i>Listen, Ted, you're great,
and this is so difficult,</i>

215
00:11:13,713 --> 00:11:16,307
<i>but I think we're looking
for different things.</i>

216
00:11:16,449 --> 00:11:20,443
<i>So, live long and prosper. Whatever.</i>

217
00:11:25,993 --> 00:11:28,758
That was you? This is insane!

218
00:11:28,863 --> 00:11:33,027
Ted, I did those things to help you.
You're a commitment junkie.

219
00:11:33,134 --> 00:11:36,467
You fall in love with these women
even if they don't deserve you.

220
00:11:36,571 --> 00:11:39,132
What if one of those women was
supposed to be the mother of my children?

221
00:11:39,241 --> 00:11:43,007
If there was ever the tiniest chance
of that, I swear I didn't do anything.

222
00:11:43,112 --> 00:11:47,446
- Like with Victoria or Stella.
- Or Robin.

223
00:11:48,418 --> 00:11:52,047
- Or Robin.
- Robin, Robin...

224
00:11:52,288 --> 00:11:54,586
Did you break us up, too?

225
00:11:55,025 --> 00:11:57,016
Did you break us up, too?

226
00:11:57,127 --> 00:11:59,722
Stop talking to me like I'm your enemy!

227
00:11:59,864 --> 00:12:01,331
You weep for these women,

228
00:12:01,432 --> 00:12:04,833
but you have the luxury
of not knowing what I know,

229
00:12:04,935 --> 00:12:06,835
that those breakups, while tragic,

230
00:12:06,937 --> 00:12:10,931
probably saved you from a crappy
and very expensive first marriage.

231
00:12:11,043 --> 00:12:12,874
Did you break me and Robin up?

232
00:12:12,978 --> 00:12:15,242
You don't want the truth
because deep down,

233
00:12:15,347 --> 00:12:17,508
you want me out there
watching out for you.

234
00:12:17,616 --> 00:12:20,313
And deep down, you know
that none of those women

235
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:22,684
were ever gonna
be the mother of your children.

236
00:12:22,789 --> 00:12:25,053
- Did you break me and Robin up?
- I did what I had to do.

237
00:12:25,158 --> 00:12:28,685
- Did you break me and Robin up?
- You're damn right I did!

238
00:12:32,566 --> 00:12:36,525
Marshall, your grandpa Olaf
was a wise man.

239
00:12:41,910 --> 00:12:43,502
You broke me and Robin up?

240
00:12:43,611 --> 00:12:45,374
- No, it's not...
- I cannot believe this.

241
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:47,243
I need another drink.

242
00:12:47,482 --> 00:12:49,780
You know, I feel a little breeze down there.
It's nice.

243
00:12:49,919 --> 00:12:53,218
You think that's something?
Stand over this heating vent.

244
00:12:53,322 --> 00:12:56,257
It's like your junk is on a tropical island.

245
00:12:57,626 --> 00:12:59,992
<i>- Little Barney says, "Mahalo. "
- Mmm-hmm.</i>

246
00:13:00,430 --> 00:13:03,729
Seriously, what is wrong with you, Lily?
How could you do that?

247
00:13:03,834 --> 00:13:05,927
I did this because I care about you!

248
00:13:06,036 --> 00:13:09,437
I am so glad that is the one you watched!

249
00:13:09,539 --> 00:13:11,838
Dear God, what happened to you?

250
00:13:14,011 --> 00:13:15,501
You didn't watch my show?

251
00:13:15,646 --> 00:13:19,082
Oh! The show. Sorry.
Something special happen?

252
00:13:21,620 --> 00:13:23,645
Same old same-old.

253
00:13:23,789 --> 00:13:26,485
Lily just told us that
she broke you and me up.

254
00:13:26,592 --> 00:13:29,686
What? Broke us up?
What does that even mean?

255
00:13:29,795 --> 00:13:31,525
And why are these guys
wearing nightgowns?

256
00:13:31,631 --> 00:13:32,598
- Nightshirt.
- Nightshirt.

257
00:13:32,699 --> 00:13:34,098
- It's a nightshirt.
- It's called a nightshirt, Robin.

258
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:36,691
Turns out Lily has taken it upon herself
to sabotage

259
00:13:36,803 --> 00:13:38,634
many of my relationships, including ours.

260
00:13:38,738 --> 00:13:40,501
No. Robin was different.

261
00:13:40,607 --> 00:13:42,269
I didn't want you two to break up,

262
00:13:42,376 --> 00:13:47,370
but you wanted completely different things
out of life and refused to deal with it.

263
00:13:47,481 --> 00:13:49,813
I could just picture that front porch.

264
00:13:50,084 --> 00:13:51,950
Hmm. Two of hearts.

265
00:13:52,053 --> 00:13:54,453
Just like the hearts of the two children
I never had

266
00:13:54,556 --> 00:13:56,956
because my lovely wife hates kids.

267
00:13:57,993 --> 00:13:59,824
Mmm, a deuce.

268
00:13:59,928 --> 00:14:01,828
Exactly what my career dropped

269
00:14:01,930 --> 00:14:04,764
once I decided to settle down
and marry Ted.

270
00:14:05,535 --> 00:14:07,935
Bridge! I win.

271
00:14:08,805 --> 00:14:12,104
Well, I do not like that scenario one bit.

272
00:14:12,208 --> 00:14:15,736
All I tried to do was get you guys
to talk about your issues.

273
00:14:16,346 --> 00:14:20,146
<i>I didn't know I was feeding you the words
that would lead to your breakup.</i>

274
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:23,550
Hey, here's a fun question, just for fun.

275
00:14:23,855 --> 00:14:26,323
Where do you see yourself in five years?

276
00:14:26,724 --> 00:14:29,784
You know what's fun? Fun questions.

277
00:14:29,894 --> 00:14:32,556
Where do you see yourself in five years?

278
00:14:32,864 --> 00:14:36,266
- Where do you see yourself in five years?
- Where do you see yourself?

279
00:14:36,368 --> 00:14:40,566
Not to put words in your mouth,
but you probably want to be married.

280
00:14:40,906 --> 00:14:42,567
I probably want to be married.

281
00:14:42,708 --> 00:14:45,735
You probably want to be in Tokyo or Paris.

282
00:14:45,912 --> 00:14:49,279
I probably want to be in Argentina.

283
00:14:49,382 --> 00:14:52,442
- Argentina?
- Or Tokyo or Paris.

284
00:14:53,453 --> 00:14:55,354
We have an expiration date, don't we?

285
00:14:55,957 --> 00:14:57,618
- Oh, my God.
- Lily,

286
00:14:57,725 --> 00:15:00,455
you can't manipulate people like that!

287
00:15:00,561 --> 00:15:02,426
I've known you 12 years,
and I can honestly say,

288
00:15:02,530 --> 00:15:04,362
I have never been more furious at you!

289
00:15:04,466 --> 00:15:07,060
- Look, I didn't mean to... I was just...
- No! I don't even want to hear it!

290
00:15:07,169 --> 00:15:08,329
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

291
00:15:08,437 --> 00:15:12,339
Settle down! Let's just settle down!
Now, I have one question.

292
00:15:12,741 --> 00:15:16,644
- What do these bad boys feel like in bed?
- Come on. Let's go see.

293
00:15:16,846 --> 00:15:20,373
So, if it weren't for you,
Ted and I might still be dating?

294
00:15:20,550 --> 00:15:23,246
Or you would have stayed
together far too long,

295
00:15:23,353 --> 00:15:27,154
had an incredibly bitter breakup
and not even remained friends,

296
00:15:27,258 --> 00:15:30,489
and then you and I would never
have become best friends.

297
00:15:30,594 --> 00:15:33,586
Don't even say that. Okay?

298
00:15:33,864 --> 00:15:35,264
Stop hugging!

299
00:15:35,367 --> 00:15:39,463
Lily, you had no right
to interfere in my relationships.

300
00:15:39,571 --> 00:15:40,731
You got lucky. Okay?

301
00:15:40,839 --> 00:15:43,967
You met the love of your life
in a dorm hallway when you were 18.

302
00:15:44,075 --> 00:15:45,839
But that doesn't give you
the right to play God

303
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:49,278
to the rest of us mortals down here
who are still looking for someone.

304
00:15:49,382 --> 00:15:51,509
You're so concerned about
who you and Marshall are gonna end up

305
00:15:51,617 --> 00:15:54,381
on that front porch with.
Well, you know what?

306
00:15:54,487 --> 00:15:56,581
You can have it to yourselves.

307
00:16:01,728 --> 00:16:03,457
What happened to your jacket?

308
00:16:03,563 --> 00:16:06,158
Soot, bread crumbs, placenta.

309
00:16:06,401 --> 00:16:08,665
Did you at least TiVo it?

310
00:16:11,039 --> 00:16:14,975
So, you're this comfy every night,
and Lily still has sex with you?

311
00:16:15,209 --> 00:16:18,373
Yeah. That's what marriage is all about,
man, unconditional love.

312
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:21,608
You can wear whatever you want
and still get laid.

313
00:16:22,051 --> 00:16:24,212
Tell me more about being married.

314
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:27,081
Well, sometimes, when you're married,

315
00:16:27,390 --> 00:16:30,325
you wake up to the smell of
breakfast already on the table.

316
00:16:30,427 --> 00:16:32,759
- And coffee, too?
- And coffee, too.

317
00:16:33,063 --> 00:16:37,592
Sometimes, she'll even put out
a vase of freshly cut flowers.

318
00:16:37,702 --> 00:16:39,192
I love flowers.

319
00:16:40,871 --> 00:16:42,065
And sometimes,

320
00:16:42,173 --> 00:16:44,471
when you're worried you've made
all the wrong decisions in life,

321
00:16:44,575 --> 00:16:48,569
and you're not nearly the man you
want to be, what does she do then?

322
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:52,480
Well, she tells you that you're great
and it's all gonna be okay.

323
00:16:52,584 --> 00:16:55,018
That's wonderful.

324
00:16:55,954 --> 00:17:00,085
And she'll help you find other girls
to have sex with?

325
00:17:02,929 --> 00:17:04,157
I mean, I guess.

326
00:17:04,263 --> 00:17:07,357
Maybe if you agreed
upon that beforehand, yeah.

327
00:17:08,035 --> 00:17:09,024
Mmm.

328
00:17:09,136 --> 00:17:11,263
Little guy had a big day.

329
00:17:11,538 --> 00:17:15,167
We'll talk about it tomorrow.
Sweet dreams, slugger.

330
00:17:30,092 --> 00:17:32,754
<i>The next night,
I was still angry at your aunt Lily.</i>

331
00:17:32,862 --> 00:17:34,056
<i>Until...</i>

332
00:17:34,630 --> 00:17:37,428
- Hi.
- Hi. What are you...

333
00:17:40,637 --> 00:17:43,128
Lily came by and explained everything.

334
00:17:43,407 --> 00:17:45,841
And she gave me this note for you.

335
00:17:50,148 --> 00:17:51,638
<i>"Ted, I'm sorry.</i>

336
00:17:51,883 --> 00:17:54,181
<i>"It doesn't matter to me who you marry.</i>

337
00:17:54,285 --> 00:17:58,051
<i>"I know they'll be awesome
because they'll think you are.</i>

338
00:17:58,189 --> 00:18:02,650
<i>"To show I mean it, I put together
a little surprise for you and Karen upstairs.</i>

339
00:18:02,761 --> 00:18:03,989
<i>"Love, Lily. "</i>

340
00:18:04,096 --> 00:18:06,758
<i>"P.S. Sorry the envelope
was already open.</i>

341
00:18:06,899 --> 00:18:09,835
<i>"I had to read what she wrote. Marshall. "</i>

342
00:18:10,670 --> 00:18:13,332
Sabotaging our relationship? I got to say,

343
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:16,136
even using the specially-ordered,
extra-low bar

344
00:18:16,242 --> 00:18:17,675
by which I judge your friends,

345
00:18:17,777 --> 00:18:19,836
Lily really outdid herself this time.

346
00:18:19,946 --> 00:18:22,245
Obviously, we can't ever see her again.

347
00:18:22,516 --> 00:18:25,451
I know. It's a big loss, right?

348
00:18:29,323 --> 00:18:32,225
Hey, remember
your old college roommate?

349
00:18:32,327 --> 00:18:35,888
He was married to
that shrill, little idiot girl.

350
00:18:36,031 --> 00:18:40,161
Marshall. Oh, it's been so long.

351
00:18:40,268 --> 00:18:42,066
God, I hated him.

352
00:18:42,505 --> 00:18:44,598
Anyway, here's his obituary.

353
00:18:46,476 --> 00:18:50,708
And I realized, maybe it shouldn't matter
what my friends think of my girlfriend,

354
00:18:50,813 --> 00:18:54,215
but it sure as hell matters what
my girlfriend thinks of my friends.

355
00:18:54,318 --> 00:18:57,685
- Wow. So you ended it?
- Yeah.

356
00:18:59,656 --> 00:19:03,058
So if you want to be my plus one,
Lily's a damn good cook.

357
00:19:03,161 --> 00:19:04,423
Mmm!

358
00:19:04,529 --> 00:19:08,693
Beef pot pie, mac and cheese,
homemade buttermilk biscuits.

359
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:11,793
Wow, no wonder Marshall dies at 68.

360
00:19:13,606 --> 00:19:14,698
Thank you.

361
00:19:14,874 --> 00:19:17,434
<i>So, Robin and I
enjoyed a gourmet dinner.</i>

362
00:19:17,710 --> 00:19:19,473
<i>Well, for her it was breakfast.</i>

363
00:19:19,578 --> 00:19:23,208
<i>And we ended up doing exactly what
Lily wanted us to do all along,</i>

364
00:19:23,350 --> 00:19:25,250
<i>we talked about our relationship.</i>

365
00:19:26,586 --> 00:19:30,716
- So, Lily broke us up, sort of.
- Yeah.

366
00:19:31,825 --> 00:19:34,522
- Kind of makes you wonder.
- Yeah.

367
00:19:34,795 --> 00:19:39,357
I mean, if it weren't for her,
would we still be dating right now?

368
00:19:39,567 --> 00:19:40,966
Maybe.

369
00:19:42,403 --> 00:19:45,464
But Lily was right. We weren't ready.

370
00:19:45,774 --> 00:19:48,607
We both needed to move on,
do our own thing.

371
00:19:49,111 --> 00:19:51,909
- Still do, I guess.
- Mmm-hmm.

372
00:19:53,483 --> 00:19:55,314
We should make a pact.

373
00:19:55,652 --> 00:19:58,621
If the years go by, and we both turn 40,

374
00:19:58,721 --> 00:20:00,484
and we're still single, we...

375
00:20:06,697 --> 00:20:11,100
Robin Scherbatsky,
will you be my backup wife?

376
00:20:12,336 --> 00:20:14,635
A girl always dreams
of hearing those words.

377
00:20:14,739 --> 00:20:17,731
Yes! Yes! A million times, yes!

378
00:20:23,181 --> 00:20:24,342
Thank you.

379
00:20:25,484 --> 00:20:27,349
- All right, it's a deal.
- Yeah.

380
00:20:28,654 --> 00:20:30,815
So, should we set up
some ground rules for this?

381
00:20:30,923 --> 00:20:31,912
Okay, like what?

382
00:20:32,024 --> 00:20:34,585
I don't know. Like neither one of us
can get super fat. Stuff like that.

383
00:20:34,695 --> 00:20:36,959
Okay, I only have one,
you can't wear a nightshirt.

384
00:20:37,064 --> 00:20:39,999
- I will never wear a nightshirt.
- Thank God.

385
00:20:57,653 --> 00:20:59,177
Never mind.

386
00:20:59,822 --> 00:21:01,016
No!
