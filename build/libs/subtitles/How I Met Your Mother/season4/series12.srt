1
00:00:01,578 --> 00:00:03,205
<i>Kids, in the winter of 2009,</i>

2
00:00:03,313 --> 00:00:05,281
<i>Aunt Robin and I had
just become roommates.</i>

3
00:00:05,382 --> 00:00:07,475
<i>And to be honest,
it wasn't going very smoothly.</i>

4
00:00:07,851 --> 00:00:09,409
Ooh, that looks good.
I'm gonna get some.

5
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:12,284
- Mmm. There's no more milk.
- No, I just saw some in the fridge.

6
00:00:12,389 --> 00:00:14,220
- Empty.
- So throw it out.

7
00:00:14,324 --> 00:00:17,418
- The trash can's full.
- So take the trash out.

8
00:00:17,528 --> 00:00:19,155
I'm eating cereal.

9
00:00:19,997 --> 00:00:23,296
You know, when I asked you
to be my roommate, I figured,

10
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:25,595
"She's a girl, she'll be neat. "

11
00:00:25,702 --> 00:00:28,796
<i>But no,
you're Ogre from Revenge of the Nerds.</i>

12
00:00:29,773 --> 00:00:31,741
You know what, Ted?
Instead of coming up with

13
00:00:31,842 --> 00:00:34,436
hot-off-the-press
topical references like that,

14
00:00:34,545 --> 00:00:39,312
maybe you should spend a little time,
I don't know, washing a dish ever.

15
00:00:39,416 --> 00:00:41,611
Oh, darn, I can't.

16
00:00:41,718 --> 00:00:43,413
I'm too busy leaving a plate of cookies

17
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:46,489
for the magical elf
who changes the toilet paper roll.

18
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:49,582
Wait, there's no elf.
It's always me!

19
00:00:49,693 --> 00:00:51,524
I always change it. You never do!

20
00:00:51,628 --> 00:00:53,152
- That is ridiculous!
- No, I went in there yesterday...

21
00:00:53,263 --> 00:00:55,891
- I changed it the last five times.
- Stop! Stop!

22
00:00:55,999 --> 00:00:57,967
What is going on?

23
00:00:58,068 --> 00:01:00,901
When we were dating each other,
we were practically living together

24
00:01:01,004 --> 00:01:05,600
- and we didn't drive each other this crazy.
- I know. What happened?

25
00:01:05,709 --> 00:01:08,940
You know what it is? We were having sex.

26
00:01:09,046 --> 00:01:13,346
Men and women need sex to live together.
It solves all disputes.

27
00:01:13,450 --> 00:01:15,850
Oh, like Barney's theory about world peace?

28
00:01:16,486 --> 00:01:21,185
So I explained to her, I said, "Madeline,
every single international conflict

29
00:01:21,291 --> 00:01:24,954
"essentially boils down to sexual tension. "

30
00:01:25,062 --> 00:01:27,587
- Every international conflict?
- Every single one, dude.

31
00:01:27,698 --> 00:01:30,758
So the crisis in the Middle East
could be solved by...

32
00:01:30,867 --> 00:01:33,392
- Gaza strippers. Next.
- Uh-huh.

33
00:01:33,503 --> 00:01:36,961
- Apartheid?
- Apart thighs. What else you got?

34
00:01:37,674 --> 00:01:39,471
Cold War?

35
00:01:39,576 --> 00:01:42,943
"Mrs. Gorbachev, take down those pants. "

36
00:01:45,782 --> 00:01:48,478
Well, guess we should
just start having sex, then.

37
00:01:49,653 --> 00:01:51,086
Yeah, right.

38
00:01:52,522 --> 00:01:54,956
- Wow.
- I know.

39
00:01:55,058 --> 00:01:58,550
- It's like riding a bike, huh, buddy?
- Riding a bike upside down, maybe.

40
00:01:59,997 --> 00:02:02,795
Okay, listen.
If this is gonna happen on occasion,

41
00:02:02,899 --> 00:02:05,265
we can't tell anyone about this. Deal?

42
00:02:05,369 --> 00:02:06,631
- Deal.
- Deal.

43
00:02:24,354 --> 00:02:26,481
- Marshall, Marshall...
- What the hell are you guys doing?

44
00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:28,615
What, are you guys back together?

45
00:02:28,725 --> 00:02:31,353
No. We're just having sex
so we don't fight anymore.

46
00:02:31,495 --> 00:02:35,727
Oh, that's a great idea. No, really.
Two thumbs up, guys.

47
00:02:35,832 --> 00:02:40,531
Hey, I just looked into the future and
that works out really great for everyone.

48
00:02:40,637 --> 00:02:42,400
What are you even doing here?

49
00:02:42,506 --> 00:02:47,000
I was on my way to work
and I just had to drop by here

50
00:02:47,110 --> 00:02:48,941
to read this magazine.

51
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:54,413
- In that room over there.
- Oh, I get it.

52
00:02:54,518 --> 00:02:57,248
- No problem, buddy.
- Uh... Yes, a problem, buddy.

53
00:02:57,354 --> 00:03:00,551
You came all the way over here
to read a magazine?

54
00:03:00,657 --> 00:03:04,991
I'm willing to bet that there is a place
to read a magazine at work.

55
00:03:05,095 --> 00:03:07,723
You know,
a room with a little man on the door?

56
00:03:07,831 --> 00:03:12,564
Okay, Robin. Come on.
Nobody likes to read a magazine at work.

57
00:03:12,669 --> 00:03:15,661
I mean, you walk out of your office
holding a magazine

58
00:03:16,206 --> 00:03:19,903
<i>and that magazine is saying
one thing and one thing only.</i>

59
00:03:20,010 --> 00:03:23,275
Hey, everyone,
look at what Marshall's about to do!

60
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:25,847
Marshall's about to read
a big old magazine

61
00:03:25,948 --> 00:03:28,416
in the bathroom
that you all share with him.

62
00:03:31,387 --> 00:03:32,786
Well, have you thought about

63
00:03:32,888 --> 00:03:35,721
maybe not reading a magazine
when you read a magazine?

64
00:03:35,825 --> 00:03:39,693
You gotta read a magazine.
I mean, that's why there's magazines.

65
00:03:39,795 --> 00:03:41,558
Otherwise,
it's just time you're not getting back.

66
00:03:41,664 --> 00:03:44,599
Exactly. And the worst part is this,

67
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:48,033
that stretch of hallway
from my door to that restroom

68
00:03:48,137 --> 00:03:52,073
is a gauntlet of judging eyes.

69
00:03:52,608 --> 00:03:54,007
<i>You got my boss...</i>

70
00:03:54,110 --> 00:03:57,011
<i>We all know exactly
what you're about to do.</i>

71
00:03:58,614 --> 00:03:59,842
<i>her boss...</i>

72
00:04:00,282 --> 00:04:02,944
<i>Hey, Eriksen, why don't you
just move your desk in there?</i>

73
00:04:04,286 --> 00:04:06,254
<i>...I -Can't-Believe-He-Has-A-Wife Donald.</i>

74
00:04:06,355 --> 00:04:08,482
<i>Oh, sweetie, so obvious.</i>

75
00:04:10,559 --> 00:04:16,657
- Anyways, I just would rather do that here.
- No, I'm sorry. This is our apartment now.

76
00:04:16,766 --> 00:04:20,463
Marshall, you have
to read a magazine someplace else.

77
00:04:20,569 --> 00:04:23,060
- Give me your key.
- Yeah, I'm not gonna do that.

78
00:04:23,172 --> 00:04:24,901
- Marshall?
- I seem to recall

79
00:04:25,007 --> 00:04:27,771
a deal being struck between three parties

80
00:04:27,877 --> 00:04:32,280
wherein none would discuss
a certain event that transpired.

81
00:04:32,381 --> 00:04:33,370
An event of the...

82
00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:35,639
...persuasion.

83
00:04:35,751 --> 00:04:40,484
That key, madam, buys my silence.
Good day to you both.

84
00:04:43,125 --> 00:04:44,752
You two hooked up?

85
00:04:45,728 --> 00:04:47,423
Thanks a lot, Lily.

86
00:04:48,564 --> 00:04:54,992
So, wow. You two slept together.
That is awf... Some.

87
00:04:55,671 --> 00:04:59,698
Awfsome. Nice work, Ted. Tap that.

88
00:04:59,809 --> 00:05:03,472
- It sounds like a bigger deal than it is.
- Yeah, we talked it over,

89
00:05:03,579 --> 00:05:05,945
and we both realized
we've had a rough couple of months.

90
00:05:06,048 --> 00:05:08,141
- We deserve a little fun.
- No.

91
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:10,912
This could wind up ruining your friendship.

92
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:15,980
When two exes try to just be casual,
someone always winds up getting hurt.

93
00:05:16,091 --> 00:05:19,083
<i>Turned out, Lily was right.
But more on that later.</i>

94
00:05:19,195 --> 00:05:21,425
Look, guys, we got this covered, okay?

95
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:24,124
No one's gonna get hurt.
We set up ground rules.

96
00:05:24,834 --> 00:05:27,769
Okay, rule number one,
this is strictly a physical relationship.

97
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:29,303
There are no feelings involved, okay?

98
00:05:29,405 --> 00:05:32,203
Oh, please, that's like
telling the Fonz to be cool.

99
00:05:32,308 --> 00:05:35,334
And since it's just physical, we don't
have to worry about romance, right?

100
00:05:35,444 --> 00:05:37,810
Hell, no. Oh, we can do it
while we watch TV.

101
00:05:37,913 --> 00:05:40,108
Totally. We can multi-task, you know?

102
00:05:40,216 --> 00:05:42,810
Use the sex
to spice up otherwise dull activities.

103
00:05:42,918 --> 00:05:45,079
- Like folding laundry.
- Paying bills.

104
00:05:45,187 --> 00:05:46,677
Cooking dinner.

105
00:05:47,189 --> 00:05:49,157
- That doesn't seem hygienic.
- Yeah, not that one. No.

106
00:05:49,625 --> 00:05:52,458
And now that we're hooking up,
we're not fighting anymore.

107
00:05:52,561 --> 00:05:55,325
Problem solved.
Actually, the credit belongs to Barney.

108
00:05:55,431 --> 00:05:57,729
This whole idea came out of your thing
about world peace.

109
00:05:57,833 --> 00:06:01,894
Yeah. Thanks, Barney.
You were right. Peace was achieved.

110
00:06:02,004 --> 00:06:03,437
Repeatedly.

111
00:06:04,907 --> 00:06:10,402
So I'm responsible for...
Excellent. Excellent. Excellent.

112
00:06:12,448 --> 00:06:13,415
Uh...

113
00:06:13,582 --> 00:06:15,311
Next round's on me!

114
00:06:19,822 --> 00:06:22,222
- Hey, are you okay?
- Yeah. Why do you ask?

115
00:06:22,324 --> 00:06:25,885
Well, for one thing,
you're openly weeping.

116
00:06:25,995 --> 00:06:27,360
With joy.

117
00:06:28,631 --> 00:06:32,590
- So happy for those two.
- Barney, admit it.

118
00:06:32,701 --> 00:06:36,137
You still have feelings for Robin
and this is killing you.

119
00:06:36,238 --> 00:06:38,297
What? I am totally fine.

120
00:06:39,208 --> 00:06:41,642
Now, excuse me for just a minute.

121
00:06:53,956 --> 00:06:55,184
Totally fine.

122
00:06:55,291 --> 00:06:58,658
Barney, you have to learn
how to express these feelings.

123
00:06:58,761 --> 00:07:00,752
Maybe you should talk to a psychiatrist.

124
00:07:00,863 --> 00:07:02,296
Please.

125
00:07:02,398 --> 00:07:05,799
If I'm gonna pay some woman
$200 an hour to make me feel better,

126
00:07:05,901 --> 00:07:11,965
we aren't going to be talking.
And we're both going to be on that couch.

127
00:07:12,908 --> 00:07:15,775
The woman in this scenario is a prostitute.

128
00:07:17,446 --> 00:07:20,779
A dirty, skanky, surgically enhanced,
Eastern European...

129
00:07:20,883 --> 00:07:22,316
I got it.

130
00:07:22,418 --> 00:07:25,285
And there's something kind of liberating
about not taking it all too seriously.

131
00:07:25,387 --> 00:07:29,414
Last night, we actually did it while
I was returning a bunch of phone calls.

132
00:07:29,525 --> 00:07:32,187
I knew you didn't get a rowing machine.

133
00:07:34,930 --> 00:07:37,899
Awesome, we're still talking about this!

134
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,265
Look, guys, this is a private thing
between me and Ted.

135
00:07:41,370 --> 00:07:42,496
- Private Thing.
- Private Thing.

136
00:07:43,706 --> 00:07:48,075
We wouldn't even be talking about this
if Marshall could read a magazine at work.

137
00:07:48,177 --> 00:07:50,008
He's always been this way.

138
00:07:50,112 --> 00:07:52,979
- Remember law school?
- Sure do.

139
00:07:56,518 --> 00:08:02,548
- Baby? Baby, what is it?
- The credit card bill came today.

140
00:08:02,658 --> 00:08:07,789
You checked into a hotel
two blocks from the school on a Tuesday.

141
00:08:07,896 --> 00:08:12,060
- It's not what you think.
- Who is she, Marshall? What's her name?

142
00:08:13,369 --> 00:08:16,463
Burrito. Carnitas Burrito.

143
00:08:17,272 --> 00:08:22,801
So, you checked into a hotel room
just so you could read a magazine there?

144
00:08:22,911 --> 00:08:25,505
Hey, Robin, do you want me to see
if the waitress has any giant sugar cubes

145
00:08:25,614 --> 00:08:27,844
for that high horse of yours?

146
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:30,142
Nobody likes to read a magazine at work,

147
00:08:30,252 --> 00:08:32,516
and if they say that they do,
then they're not human.

148
00:08:32,654 --> 00:08:35,748
Dude, I read a magazine at work every day.

149
00:08:35,858 --> 00:08:38,190
I can't tell you how many meetings
I've been late to

150
00:08:38,293 --> 00:08:40,454
because I was busy reading a magazine.

151
00:08:40,562 --> 00:08:43,395
But I don't feel bad about it.
That's my time.

152
00:08:43,499 --> 00:08:46,593
Sure, "reading a magazine" ain't pretty,

153
00:08:46,702 --> 00:08:50,968
but, you know, it's something I gotta do.
So why be ashamed about it?

154
00:08:52,841 --> 00:08:56,174
Wait, reading a magazine
means masturbating, right?

155
00:08:58,380 --> 00:09:01,679
I can't believe it.
You drank all my milk again.

156
00:09:02,885 --> 00:09:04,443
- We can have sex.
- Okay.

157
00:09:06,955 --> 00:09:08,320
It's the perfect setup.

158
00:09:08,424 --> 00:09:10,255
Anytime we start getting into
an argument,

159
00:09:10,359 --> 00:09:11,849
- we just have sex instead.
- Ha!

160
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:15,225
One minute we're just laying into
each other, and then the next minute...

161
00:09:15,330 --> 00:09:16,797
Well, same thing.

162
00:09:17,733 --> 00:09:18,700
Awesome.

163
00:09:22,137 --> 00:09:24,605
So, this morning,
she's yelling at me through the door,

164
00:09:24,706 --> 00:09:29,200
"You're taking too long in the shower!"
Next thing I know, she hops in.

165
00:09:30,212 --> 00:09:32,680
Now baby don't mind I took my time.

166
00:09:34,083 --> 00:09:35,414
So awesome.

167
00:09:38,887 --> 00:09:40,047
Sorry I'm late.

168
00:09:40,155 --> 00:09:43,454
I was just jamming on Scherbatsky.
She used up all my stamps,

169
00:09:43,559 --> 00:09:46,926
so long story short,
the postman rang twice.

170
00:09:47,029 --> 00:09:48,724
You must bump this!

171
00:09:50,332 --> 00:09:53,995
That's just so...

172
00:09:55,170 --> 00:09:57,195
Excuse me for a second.

173
00:10:08,584 --> 00:10:10,882
So, you're saying plasmas
are better for low light,

174
00:10:10,986 --> 00:10:12,886
but LCDs are better for games?

175
00:10:12,988 --> 00:10:17,583
Right, but the CRTs have the truest blacks.

176
00:10:17,692 --> 00:10:22,152
- So, if I want a really crisp contrast ratio...
- The CRT's deep-pixel cell structure

177
00:10:22,263 --> 00:10:24,959
produces a resolution
you just can't match with an LCD.

178
00:10:25,066 --> 00:10:26,033
Uh-huh.

179
00:10:26,667 --> 00:10:27,725
I'll take the CRT.

180
00:10:32,106 --> 00:10:35,598
- Barney, this is nuts.
- I'm doing just fine, thank you.

181
00:10:35,710 --> 00:10:39,908
No, you're not.
You need to learn to let this stuff out.

182
00:10:40,014 --> 00:10:44,417
Like we do in my kindergarten class.
Feelings Hour every Tuesday morning.

183
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:46,316
Look, Lily, maybe your kindergartners

184
00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:50,584
are upset that their friends
are sleeping with each other, but not me.

185
00:10:50,691 --> 00:10:51,817
I have never been better.

186
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:55,060
<i>Meanwhile,
Marshall was still struggling at work.</i>

187
00:10:56,497 --> 00:10:59,022
Coming through.
Big breakfast this morning.

188
00:10:59,133 --> 00:11:01,192
You know what that means.

189
00:11:02,203 --> 00:11:04,933
<i>But then came the best news
he'd heard in a long time.</i>

190
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:08,304
And did you hear? They laid off
everybody on the eighth floor.

191
00:11:08,409 --> 00:11:10,969
I know. It's a ghost town down there.

192
00:11:36,237 --> 00:11:37,602
- Morning.
- Morning.

193
00:11:37,705 --> 00:11:41,505
- Hey, that was fun last night.
- Word, that was a good one.

194
00:11:41,609 --> 00:11:44,476
Mental note,
don't throw out the pizza box more often.

195
00:11:45,913 --> 00:11:47,938
All right, see you later.

196
00:11:53,487 --> 00:11:54,579
Uh-oh.

197
00:11:55,056 --> 00:11:56,318
Uh-oh.

198
00:12:01,495 --> 00:12:04,328
So last night,
Robin left a pizza box out on the floor,

199
00:12:04,432 --> 00:12:06,127
- so we had sex three times.
- Sure.

200
00:12:06,234 --> 00:12:09,533
And then, this morning
before I left for work, we kissed.

201
00:12:09,637 --> 00:12:12,868
That's weird. That is weird.

202
00:12:12,974 --> 00:12:16,273
Right? That kiss violated the spirit
of our whole arrangement.

203
00:12:16,377 --> 00:12:18,811
I mean, she probably thinks
I'm getting feelings for her.

204
00:12:18,913 --> 00:12:22,508
- Well, are you?
- Yes, I'm in love with her.

205
00:12:23,751 --> 00:12:25,878
Is what you... That's you, dude.

206
00:12:27,421 --> 00:12:28,911
No. It didn't mean anything.

207
00:12:29,023 --> 00:12:32,015
It was just some leftover reflex
from when we were a couple.

208
00:12:32,126 --> 00:12:38,725
- But I think I probably blew it.
- Definitely. It is so over.

209
00:12:39,533 --> 00:12:41,797
Hold the phone.
Maybe Robin didn't think it was weird.

210
00:12:41,936 --> 00:12:45,667
It was weird.
Weird, weird, weird, weird, weird.

211
00:12:45,773 --> 00:12:48,435
W- I-E-R-D, weird.

212
00:12:48,542 --> 00:12:51,909
- That's not how you spell weird.
- Come on, Lily. Nobody likes a Ted.

213
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:57,279
I tried to warn you. When exes relapse,
someone always gets hurt.

214
00:12:57,418 --> 00:13:00,114
But no one listened. Story of my life.

215
00:13:00,221 --> 00:13:03,190
My cuteness interferes
with people hearing my message.

216
00:13:03,291 --> 00:13:04,417
Well, what should I do?

217
00:13:04,692 --> 00:13:06,455
There's only one thing to do.

218
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:09,427
You have to
stop sleeping together, please.

219
00:13:10,398 --> 00:13:15,335
I think we have to stop sleeping together.
With me and Ted, it's like cigarettes.

220
00:13:15,436 --> 00:13:17,495
You have one when you're drunk
and you think it's fine.

221
00:13:17,605 --> 00:13:20,165
But before you know it,
you're buying a carton a week.

222
00:13:20,775 --> 00:13:22,003
I think I have to end it.

223
00:13:22,276 --> 00:13:24,301
Yup. I have to end it.

224
00:13:24,645 --> 00:13:27,671
So, we're ending it, huh?

225
00:13:27,782 --> 00:13:30,148
- I think so, yeah.
- It's probably for the best.

226
00:13:30,251 --> 00:13:31,218
Mmm-hmm.

227
00:13:31,319 --> 00:13:33,685
It was fun,
but I don't want things to get weird.

228
00:13:33,788 --> 00:13:35,813
- Me neither.
- Roomies?

229
00:13:35,923 --> 00:13:37,117
Roomies.

230
00:13:40,227 --> 00:13:41,353
Robin!

231
00:13:41,662 --> 00:13:43,994
But we tell no one. Deal?

232
00:13:44,298 --> 00:13:45,322
- Deal.
- Deal.

233
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:47,292
Dude!
- Come on!

234
00:13:47,468 --> 00:13:49,561
What is the matter with you?

235
00:13:51,305 --> 00:13:52,294
That one.

236
00:13:55,443 --> 00:13:57,673
So, that didn't last long.

237
00:13:58,346 --> 00:14:01,213
By the way, Marshall, what were you doing
back in our apartment?

238
00:14:01,315 --> 00:14:02,907
I thought you had the perfect situation.

239
00:14:04,085 --> 00:14:05,074
I did.

240
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:07,151
<i>Everything was going great.</i>

241
00:14:07,254 --> 00:14:10,781
<i>I was feeling more comfortable,
more confident.</i>

242
00:14:10,891 --> 00:14:13,189
<i>I felt I could take on the world.</i>

243
00:14:14,095 --> 00:14:17,895
<i>Till one morning, I took my magazine
down to the eighth floor.</i>

244
00:14:22,002 --> 00:14:28,237
We gotta gut this whole place.
I need these walls taken out here and here.

245
00:14:28,342 --> 00:14:30,207
- You got it.
- All right.

246
00:14:32,813 --> 00:14:36,476
Celebrities pick up their dry cleaning?
I pick up my dry cleaning.

247
00:14:38,219 --> 00:14:39,311
Don't come in!

248
00:14:39,854 --> 00:14:41,822
So that didn't last long.

249
00:14:44,425 --> 00:14:46,893
- Oh, thanks.
- What are you doing?

250
00:14:46,994 --> 00:14:49,462
Oh, well, since all these roomie squabbles

251
00:14:49,563 --> 00:14:52,623
are still causing friction between you
and Robin, I thought I'd help out.

252
00:14:52,733 --> 00:14:56,169
Oh, BTW, I went by the post office today.
I picked you up some stamps.

253
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:58,170
Here's 10,000. That ought to do you.

254
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:03,042
Um, okay. Thanks, I guess.
Hey, you want a beer?

255
00:15:03,411 --> 00:15:05,606
- Okay.
- Whoa!

256
00:15:06,514 --> 00:15:10,348
Yeah, I picked those up on the way over.
It was nothing.

257
00:15:10,451 --> 00:15:12,885
Did you buy us a dishwasher?

258
00:15:12,987 --> 00:15:16,479
No. That dishwasher's always been there.
How long have you lived here?

259
00:15:22,830 --> 00:15:26,732
So, you're doing all this
to keep me and Robin from fighting, huh?

260
00:15:26,834 --> 00:15:29,667
Exactly. I worry about you two.

261
00:15:31,972 --> 00:15:35,464
It bothers you that Robin and I
are hooking up, doesn't it?

262
00:15:35,576 --> 00:15:38,943
No. Not at all. That's crazy.

263
00:15:40,614 --> 00:15:41,672
What?

264
00:15:44,385 --> 00:15:46,444
Are you in love with Robin?

265
00:15:52,893 --> 00:15:56,488
You're in love with Robin.
That's why you don't want us hooking up.

266
00:15:56,597 --> 00:15:58,997
What? That is crazy talk.

267
00:15:59,099 --> 00:16:03,900
Can't a bro clean another bro's apartment
like bros do?

268
00:16:04,004 --> 00:16:07,269
Name me one bro in the history of bros
who has ever done that.

269
00:16:07,374 --> 00:16:08,466
Um...

270
00:16:10,377 --> 00:16:14,609
I'll name two.
Misters Clean and Belvedere.

271
00:16:15,983 --> 00:16:19,180
Look, this thing with me and Robin,
it's totally casual.

272
00:16:19,286 --> 00:16:22,517
I'm not gonna freak out if you tell me
you have feelings for her. So, do you?

273
00:16:22,623 --> 00:16:26,320
No. No, I don't. I don't, no.
I don't. I don't. No.

274
00:16:26,427 --> 00:16:29,658
Robin is all yours, dude. Have fun with her.

275
00:16:29,763 --> 00:16:34,564
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I'm gonna go sleep with other girls.

276
00:16:34,668 --> 00:16:36,397
- Are you sure?
- Yes!

277
00:16:36,504 --> 00:16:39,234
- Positive?
- Absolutely.

278
00:16:42,142 --> 00:16:45,202
And then I stormed out. Why did I do that?

279
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:49,410
I mean,
maybe it goes back to my father issues,

280
00:16:49,517 --> 00:16:55,080
but I basically gave my best friend license
to have sex with the girl of my dreams.

281
00:16:55,189 --> 00:16:57,282
I totally sabotaged myself.

282
00:16:59,093 --> 00:17:01,459
And now I'm smoking. Now I'm smoking.

283
00:17:02,695 --> 00:17:04,822
Get out.

284
00:17:05,231 --> 00:17:09,031
But it's Feelings Hour
and I'm holding Feely the Share Bear.

285
00:17:09,135 --> 00:17:10,864
And whoever's holding
Feely the Share Bear

286
00:17:10,970 --> 00:17:12,494
gets to sit in the share chair.

287
00:17:12,605 --> 00:17:16,234
Barney,
this is not your private therapist's office.

288
00:17:16,342 --> 00:17:19,334
These kids have issues to talk about, too,
you know.

289
00:17:19,445 --> 00:17:21,174
Ben's parents are getting divorced.

290
00:17:21,281 --> 00:17:22,475
They are?

291
00:17:23,650 --> 00:17:25,845
Who wants to do some coloring?

292
00:17:29,422 --> 00:17:33,449
Oh, great. Did Lily send you?
I don't have the bear, okay?

293
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:35,425
I'm not giving it back!

294
00:17:36,596 --> 00:17:38,188
Why are you smiling?

295
00:17:38,298 --> 00:17:39,265
Oh,

296
00:17:39,599 --> 00:17:43,467
I just read a magazine. Here at work.

297
00:17:44,537 --> 00:17:46,937
- What?
- Yeah. It's the funniest thing.

298
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:49,270
I was online, looking up rates for hotels

299
00:17:50,043 --> 00:17:51,704
<i>when I realized something.</i>

300
00:17:51,811 --> 00:17:53,301
This is stupid.

301
00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:57,313
I decided it was time
to let go of my hang-ups

302
00:17:57,417 --> 00:18:01,285
and do the thing I gotta do, and once
I made that decision, everything changed.

303
00:18:05,058 --> 00:18:08,516
<i>There's a young man
who's comfortable with who he is.</i>

304
00:18:13,099 --> 00:18:16,591
<i>I know what you're about to do,
and I respect you for it.</i>

305
00:18:17,804 --> 00:18:20,398
<i>Hey, Eriksen. Go the distance.</i>

306
00:18:28,081 --> 00:18:31,812
Marshall, you made a brave step today.

307
00:18:32,318 --> 00:18:33,945
Remember what Shakespeare wrote,

308
00:18:34,053 --> 00:18:37,819
"Virtue is bold,
and goodness never fearful. "

309
00:18:38,358 --> 00:18:40,758
You're right, Super-Hot-Lady

310
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:44,091
Who-My-Wife-Keeps-Telling-Me
Why-You're-Famous-But-I-Keep-Forgetting.

311
00:18:44,197 --> 00:18:46,665
- Let's do this.
- Lead the way.

312
00:18:51,404 --> 00:18:53,929
Wow, Marshall. Congratulations.

313
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:56,304
Thanks. I was gonna
have to do it eventually, you know?

314
00:18:56,409 --> 00:19:00,641
Sometimes you just gotta man up
and just go for it.

315
00:19:02,849 --> 00:19:04,817
Marshall, I have to go.

316
00:19:06,653 --> 00:19:10,555
Oh, by the way, I have a bathroom here
if you ever want to use it.

317
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:14,749
Son of a...

318
00:19:15,795 --> 00:19:19,162
Ted, I have to tell you the truth.
I'm in love with

319
00:19:19,265 --> 00:19:20,425
tacos.

320
00:19:21,968 --> 00:19:25,165
- What are you doing?
- I'm taking out the trizzash.

321
00:19:25,271 --> 00:19:28,172
If you're looking for Ted, he left.

322
00:19:28,274 --> 00:19:33,769
And our little arrangement is over,
by the way.

323
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:36,440
Really? That's awes... Full.

324
00:19:36,549 --> 00:19:39,643
- Awesful?
- Yeah, it's just awesful.

325
00:19:40,887 --> 00:19:43,355
- What happened?
- He just insisted.

326
00:19:43,456 --> 00:19:46,983
He said he couldn't do it anymore
because someone's gonna get hurt.

327
00:19:47,093 --> 00:19:50,756
- I think we all know who he meant by that.
- Do we?

328
00:19:52,632 --> 00:19:54,896
Isn't it obvious?

329
00:19:55,001 --> 00:19:57,492
- Is it?
- Yeah.

330
00:19:57,603 --> 00:19:58,661
It's Ted.

331
00:19:58,771 --> 00:20:00,602
- Oh.
- You know what a romantic he is.

332
00:20:00,707 --> 00:20:03,232
He can't separate
the physical from the emotional.

333
00:20:03,342 --> 00:20:04,900
- He's all like...
- I love you.

334
00:20:05,011 --> 00:20:08,503
Exactly. He's not like you, you know?

335
00:20:09,515 --> 00:20:14,214
Besides, we're friends. I don't want
to screw that up by getting involved.

336
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:16,584
Dating friends never works out.

337
00:20:17,824 --> 00:20:20,224
So you want to get a taco?

338
00:20:21,761 --> 00:20:22,989
A taco?

339
00:20:23,730 --> 00:20:25,493
You love them, remember?

340
00:20:25,598 --> 00:20:28,590
- Right.
- Come on, I'm hungry.

341
00:20:28,701 --> 00:20:32,967
<i>Wake up, I'm trying to show you</i>

342
00:20:36,476 --> 00:20:39,240
<i>I wanna come clean</i>

343
00:20:39,345 --> 00:20:42,075
<i>So Robin and I went back
to just being roommates,</i>

344
00:20:42,181 --> 00:20:45,844
<i>and things went back to normal.
Your Aunt Lily was right.</i>

345
00:20:45,952 --> 00:20:49,945
<i>When two exes decide to just be casual,
someone always gets hurt.</i>

346
00:20:52,492 --> 00:20:54,460
<i>It just wasn't one of us.</i>

347
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:58,929
<i>The one that you put on a pedestal</i>
