1
00:00:02,316 --> 00:00:04,459
<i>Kids, Stella Zinman was the girl</i>

2
00:00:04,584 --> 00:00:06,960
<i>I thought I'd spend
the rest of my life with.</i>

3
00:00:07,085 --> 00:00:10,530
<i>Until she left me at the altar,
smashing my heart to smithereens.</i>

4
00:00:10,655 --> 00:00:12,933
<i>So when I ran into her
seven months later,</i>

5
00:00:13,058 --> 00:00:15,134
<i>there was only one way
to deal with her.</i>

6
00:00:17,721 --> 00:00:19,430
- Great to see you!
- You, too.

7
00:00:20,167 --> 00:00:20,973
And Tony!

8
00:00:23,060 --> 00:00:24,477
What a nice surprise.

9
00:00:24,645 --> 00:00:26,088
"What a nice surprise"?

10
00:00:26,213 --> 00:00:27,878
No, a nice surprise would be

11
00:00:28,003 --> 00:00:31,032
if a safe fell from 40 stories
and smushed them both.

12
00:00:31,157 --> 00:00:32,610
You didn't let them have it?

13
00:00:32,778 --> 00:00:36,155
No, we had a nice friendly chat, then,
they went their way and I went mine.

14
00:00:36,323 --> 00:00:38,423
You blew it.
He blew it, right?

15
00:00:40,977 --> 00:00:42,620
- Well played, sir.
- Bravo.

16
00:00:42,788 --> 00:00:43,996
- What?
- You see,

17
00:00:44,164 --> 00:00:47,641
Ted played it cool, which is exactly
what he should have done.

18
00:00:47,766 --> 00:00:50,419
As a matter of fact,
I'd say on a scale ranging from...

19
00:00:50,587 --> 00:00:52,338
And I kept this sweater of yours...

20
00:00:53,465 --> 00:00:55,734
and sometimes
I just sit in the bathtub

21
00:00:55,859 --> 00:00:59,176
for hours just,
you know, just sniffing it.

22
00:00:59,874 --> 00:01:01,055
... all the way to...

23
00:01:01,223 --> 00:01:02,873
This is my new fianc?e.

24
00:01:02,998 --> 00:01:04,308
She's basically Stella,

25
00:01:04,476 --> 00:01:06,908
except she's French
and, as you can see,

26
00:01:07,033 --> 00:01:08,733
she's got enormous cans.

27
00:01:09,085 --> 00:01:10,085
<i>Enchant?e.</i>

28
00:01:12,604 --> 00:01:13,604
<i>Enchant?.</i>

29
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:20,199
I'd say you nailed it.

30
00:01:20,629 --> 00:01:21,898
I'll do you one better.

31
00:01:22,023 --> 00:01:23,953
You, sir, got Stella thinking.

32
00:01:24,323 --> 00:01:27,957
"Gosh, Ted seemed so cool today.
Did I choose the wrong guy?"

33
00:01:28,779 --> 00:01:30,751
Give it a week, you'll get her back.

34
00:01:31,342 --> 00:01:32,542
And her front.

35
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:36,632
Did you just feel that?
I think we just had a "what up" quake.

36
00:01:38,613 --> 00:01:40,213
I don't want her back.

37
00:01:40,338 --> 00:01:42,359
Or her front.
I just want to move on.

38
00:01:42,484 --> 00:01:44,438
And this was an important step
towards that.

39
00:01:44,563 --> 00:01:45,886
To moving on.

40
00:01:46,651 --> 00:01:48,751
<i>And you know, I really meant it.</i>

41
00:01:49,279 --> 00:01:52,200
<i>But still, that night,
my mind began to wander.</i>

42
00:01:56,236 --> 00:01:57,653
I made a terrible mistake.

43
00:01:57,821 --> 00:02:00,239
I know.
I'm a better person than you are.

44
00:02:00,407 --> 00:02:01,740
You totally are.

45
00:02:01,865 --> 00:02:03,784
Let's get back together,
and have way more sex.

46
00:02:03,952 --> 00:02:04,952
Deal!

47
00:02:15,156 --> 00:02:16,046
Hello, Ted.

48
00:02:17,366 --> 00:02:19,866
Sync by vNaru

49
00:02:31,850 --> 00:02:33,844
No, come in. It's not weird at all.

50
00:02:38,714 --> 00:02:41,113
I knew it was wrong
to steal somebody's fianc?e.

51
00:02:41,499 --> 00:02:44,098
I mean, I grappled with it.
I was up nights.

52
00:02:44,223 --> 00:02:45,891
And not for the good reason.

53
00:02:46,016 --> 00:02:47,828
Well, sometimes for the good reason.

54
00:02:48,157 --> 00:02:50,556
I mean, Stella and I hadn't
seen each other in five years,

55
00:02:50,681 --> 00:02:54,332
so, as you can imagine, the beginning,
it was just fast and furious.

56
00:02:54,457 --> 00:02:57,463
Lamps breaking, furniture moving.
You see this bald patch?

57
00:02:58,548 --> 00:03:00,048
Anyway, we moved on.

58
00:03:00,408 --> 00:03:03,200
Me, Lucy, Stella,
we were gonna move to L.A.

59
00:03:03,325 --> 00:03:04,928
I was gonna become a screenwriter.

60
00:03:06,014 --> 00:03:08,636
Then we bumped into you,
and you just looked so...

61
00:03:09,267 --> 00:03:10,267
sad.

62
00:03:10,727 --> 00:03:11,894
Sad? No.

63
00:03:12,203 --> 00:03:14,563
I think what you're calling sad
was actually

64
00:03:14,878 --> 00:03:16,172
a jovial nonchalance.

65
00:03:16,297 --> 00:03:17,720
You looked awful, okay?

66
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:19,768
Like a little dachshund puppy

67
00:03:19,893 --> 00:03:22,455
with a bad back that's got
to pull itself around on a cart.

68
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:23,781
Why are you here?

69
00:03:26,024 --> 00:03:27,743
I know I can
come across pretty tough,

70
00:03:28,010 --> 00:03:30,371
but I can't bear to have hurt someone
the way I hurt you.

71
00:03:30,902 --> 00:03:34,043
I think fate put me on that corner
to make this right.

72
00:03:34,168 --> 00:03:38,065
Obviously, I can't fill that giant
crater that Stella left in your heart.

73
00:03:38,505 --> 00:03:41,590
- I've been dating. Like, a lot.
- And then I heard you got fired.

74
00:03:41,758 --> 00:03:44,258
I transitioned into small business
ownership.

75
00:03:44,383 --> 00:03:45,920
T's the backbone of the economy.

76
00:03:46,096 --> 00:03:47,096
No, it's not.

77
00:03:47,577 --> 00:03:49,681
Ted, my family's got a lot of money.

78
00:03:50,039 --> 00:03:52,976
And I want to use that money
to make this right with you.

79
00:03:53,770 --> 00:03:54,837
Tony is rich?

80
00:03:57,723 --> 00:04:00,234
Ted, tell me he wrote you a check.

81
00:04:00,635 --> 00:04:02,486
Tell me he wrote you

82
00:04:02,728 --> 00:04:04,601
a big, fat check.

83
00:04:04,726 --> 00:04:07,950
A check so big it doesn't take
its shirt off when it goes swimming.

84
00:04:08,316 --> 00:04:09,830
That is a big, fat check.

85
00:04:09,955 --> 00:04:13,414
A check so big, if you had sex with it,
you wouldn't tell your buddies.

86
00:04:13,582 --> 00:04:15,374
That is a big, fat check.

87
00:04:15,542 --> 00:04:19,233
A check so big that
when you sit next to it on an airplane,

88
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:22,089
you find yourself wondering whether
the check should have bought 2 seats.

89
00:04:22,257 --> 00:04:25,497
- That...
- Is a big, fat check!

90
00:04:25,885 --> 00:04:27,636
Yeah! He didn't write me a check.

91
00:04:28,013 --> 00:04:30,389
- Ted, I want to offer you a job.
- A job?

92
00:04:30,557 --> 00:04:33,394
Every year, my family gives
a lot of money to Columbia University,

93
00:04:33,519 --> 00:04:34,643
so I got some pull.

94
00:04:35,291 --> 00:04:37,229
How would you like to design...

95
00:04:37,602 --> 00:04:39,187
<i>My heart leapt into my throat.</i>

96
00:04:39,312 --> 00:04:41,442
<i>A new library?
A new student center?</i>

97
00:04:41,804 --> 00:04:45,195
... your very own curriculum
as a professor of architecture.

98
00:04:47,650 --> 00:04:48,532
No, thanks.

99
00:04:48,783 --> 00:04:50,444
What do you mean,

100
00:04:51,332 --> 00:04:52,402
"No, thanks"?

101
00:04:53,198 --> 00:04:56,221
You would be a great professor, OK?

102
00:04:56,346 --> 00:04:57,846
You are knowledgeable,

103
00:04:58,077 --> 00:04:59,376
you're a good talker,

104
00:04:59,812 --> 00:05:01,522
and when you need to,

105
00:05:02,173 --> 00:05:04,381
you can grow
a very handsome neck beard.

106
00:05:05,115 --> 00:05:07,016
I'm not gonna be a professor.

107
00:05:07,141 --> 00:05:08,935
Teaching is what you do
when your career

108
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:11,869
has totally bottomed out
and you need to pay the bills.

109
00:05:13,572 --> 00:05:15,941
Small business owner.
Backbone of the economy.

110
00:05:16,066 --> 00:05:18,957
I'm not gonna take that job, all right?
I'm gonna be just fine.

111
00:05:19,082 --> 00:05:21,262
- New topic.
- Okay, new topic.

112
00:05:21,524 --> 00:05:24,879
I just got a $200
speeding ticket today.

113
00:05:25,548 --> 00:05:27,905
That sucks, dude.
You couldn't talk your way out of it?

114
00:05:28,073 --> 00:05:29,740
You can't.

115
00:05:29,908 --> 00:05:32,405
I've done it.
It was... what was it?

116
00:05:32,797 --> 00:05:34,411
It was 1998.

117
00:05:34,964 --> 00:05:36,450
So where's the fire?

118
00:05:36,575 --> 00:05:37,875
There's no fire.

119
00:05:41,077 --> 00:05:44,032
Actually, you know, there is a fire
at this barbecue I'm headed to.

120
00:05:44,157 --> 00:05:47,549
Nothing special.
Burgers, ribs... brats.

121
00:05:47,717 --> 00:05:50,437
Son, do you have any idea
how dangerous it is to be...

122
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:55,516
- Did you say brats?
- Yeah, brats.

123
00:05:56,195 --> 00:05:58,894
My mom marinates them
in Belgian beer for two days. No big.

124
00:05:59,062 --> 00:06:02,271
Funny thing was, I could've sworn
that one of those thick,

125
00:06:02,834 --> 00:06:06,833
succulent, hickory-smoked brats
had some writing on it.

126
00:06:06,958 --> 00:06:08,403
Weird. What were you saying?

127
00:06:08,965 --> 00:06:10,880
What did it say? The brat?

128
00:06:12,098 --> 00:06:15,111
It said
"Property of Minnesota State Trooper

129
00:06:15,768 --> 00:06:16,868
"Jorgensen."

130
00:06:17,851 --> 00:06:19,101
You a brat man,

131
00:06:19,768 --> 00:06:21,168
Officer Jorgensen?

132
00:06:24,039 --> 00:06:25,712
You going to this address?

133
00:06:26,066 --> 00:06:28,465
Follow me and lean on the horn.
We're gonna be running some reds.

134
00:06:30,964 --> 00:06:32,247
Well, duh.

135
00:06:32,506 --> 00:06:35,819
I would've done that, too,
if I'd have been going to a barbecue.

136
00:06:36,086 --> 00:06:37,266
Damn, I was.

137
00:06:37,434 --> 00:06:39,444
See, it's all about
sizing up your opponent.

138
00:06:39,569 --> 00:06:41,835
I could tell that the officer
was a brat man because,

139
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:44,839
well, he was out of breath
just from walking to my car and...

140
00:06:44,964 --> 00:06:47,401
he had mustard on his holster.

141
00:06:49,405 --> 00:06:52,985
Manipulating an officer of the law
with your sausage.

142
00:06:53,110 --> 00:06:54,116
That is very hot.

143
00:06:55,349 --> 00:06:57,786
You think I can't talk my way
out of a ticket?

144
00:06:58,467 --> 00:07:02,124
You think I can't talk my way
out of a ticket?

145
00:07:02,827 --> 00:07:06,077
I am Barney Stinson,
master of manipulation.

146
00:07:06,202 --> 00:07:09,344
If I can talk a stripper
into paying me for a lap dance,

147
00:07:09,469 --> 00:07:11,405
I think I can talk my way
out of a ticket.

148
00:07:11,530 --> 00:07:13,885
Challenge accept...
wait for it.

149
00:07:16,646 --> 00:07:17,723
I don't get it.

150
00:07:21,511 --> 00:07:22,576
"Accep-Ted."

151
00:07:23,236 --> 00:07:24,438
I get it now.

152
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:29,303
- What now?
- You want to be an architect?

153
00:07:29,428 --> 00:07:32,877
Great. Guy I went to private school
with wants a new house built.

154
00:07:33,450 --> 00:07:36,992
- Job's yours if you want it.
- Tony, look, I don't need your help.

155
00:07:37,324 --> 00:07:38,843
Here's what he's offering you.

156
00:07:42,696 --> 00:07:45,250
That is a big, fat check.

157
00:07:53,399 --> 00:07:54,399
Showtime.

158
00:07:55,930 --> 00:07:59,151
- License and registration.
- Of course, Officer. Right away.

159
00:08:04,924 --> 00:08:08,425
Sir, this is a gift certificate
for a custom-tailored Italian suit.

160
00:08:08,969 --> 00:08:10,588
So, we done here?

161
00:08:11,137 --> 00:08:13,228
375 dollars!

162
00:08:14,515 --> 00:08:16,715
And he kept the gift certificates.

163
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:19,728
I'm gonna call Emilio and tell him
to short-sheet him on the crotch.

164
00:08:19,896 --> 00:08:21,229
You are bad at this, dude.

165
00:08:21,397 --> 00:08:22,753
Whatever, Robin.

166
00:08:23,529 --> 00:08:25,650
Like you've ever talked
your way out of a ticket.

167
00:08:25,818 --> 00:08:27,890
Are you kidding me?
Robin's a pretty girl.

168
00:08:28,015 --> 00:08:29,581
Pretty girls don't get tickets.

169
00:08:29,706 --> 00:08:32,240
I bet she's been pulled over tons
of times, never once gotten one.

170
00:08:32,567 --> 00:08:34,370
That is outrageous!

171
00:08:34,914 --> 00:08:36,014
And factual.

172
00:08:37,398 --> 00:08:38,455
License and re...

173
00:08:41,026 --> 00:08:41,750
Honey.

174
00:08:43,285 --> 00:08:44,419
Don't cry.

175
00:08:44,693 --> 00:08:46,421
It's okay. No ticket for you.

176
00:08:47,953 --> 00:08:50,050
Go a little slower next time, okay?

177
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:55,959
Thank you.

178
00:08:59,853 --> 00:09:02,903
Excuse me.
I think I left something in New Jersey.

179
00:09:05,399 --> 00:09:07,447
How did your lunch go
with the rich guy?

180
00:09:07,572 --> 00:09:10,111
Well, it started off great.

181
00:09:10,593 --> 00:09:12,197
I want to design a house

182
00:09:12,365 --> 00:09:14,866
that celebrates the landscape
without overpowering it.

183
00:09:15,136 --> 00:09:18,453
You know, when Frank Lloyd Wright
designed Fallingwater in 1935...

184
00:09:18,621 --> 00:09:21,634
Yes, that's all fine.
I'm sure you'll do a great job.

185
00:09:21,759 --> 00:09:23,857
What I'm really worried about
is the basement.

186
00:09:23,982 --> 00:09:27,087
- Specifically the laundry room.
- The laundry room?

187
00:09:27,412 --> 00:09:30,599
I require a laundry room
of 15 feet by 15 feet,

188
00:09:31,033 --> 00:09:34,204
stain-proof ceramic tile
from floor to ceiling.

189
00:09:34,721 --> 00:09:37,800
I'm a man who likes to do
his own laundry, and sometimes,

190
00:09:38,396 --> 00:09:39,599
it gets messy.

191
00:09:39,875 --> 00:09:41,403
- Messy?
- Messy.

192
00:09:42,285 --> 00:09:45,980
Steel chains will dangle from
the ceiling at a height of nine feet.

193
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:49,540
And that is
where my laundry bags will hang

194
00:09:49,665 --> 00:09:52,465
for three days
and three nights before I...

195
00:09:53,458 --> 00:09:54,508
clean them.

196
00:09:56,109 --> 00:09:59,661
Ted, it kind of sounds like
what this guy is asking you to design...

197
00:09:59,829 --> 00:10:02,364
- It's a murder house.
- It is. It's totally a murder house.

198
00:10:03,143 --> 00:10:06,460
You know, as a martial artist,
I'm trained to trust my instincts,

199
00:10:06,585 --> 00:10:08,636
and my instincts are saying this...

200
00:10:09,639 --> 00:10:10,878
feels very good.

201
00:10:12,347 --> 00:10:13,793
The steak is so rare.

202
00:10:16,279 --> 00:10:17,095
Right?

203
00:10:18,932 --> 00:10:20,284
One final concern:

204
00:10:20,941 --> 00:10:22,016
Soundproofing.

205
00:10:22,659 --> 00:10:25,758
I tend to make a lot of racket
when I launder.

206
00:10:26,355 --> 00:10:27,956
I'll show you what I mean.

207
00:10:28,216 --> 00:10:30,218
I'm gonna go to my laundry room,

208
00:10:30,343 --> 00:10:32,277
and you tell me if you can hear me.

209
00:10:37,825 --> 00:10:39,534
Does something feel off
about this guy?

210
00:10:40,992 --> 00:10:42,142
Off the hook!

211
00:10:42,719 --> 00:10:44,205
Bro, you are nailing this.

212
00:10:47,627 --> 00:10:50,378
- You can't design a murder house!
- I'm not gonna design a murder house.

213
00:10:50,546 --> 00:10:52,797
- You can't design a murder house!
- I'm not!

214
00:10:58,440 --> 00:10:59,440
Bring it.

215
00:11:00,724 --> 00:11:02,976
Officer, please,
my wife is about to have a baby!

216
00:11:03,101 --> 00:11:05,059
- Her water just broke!
- Where's your wife?

217
00:11:06,165 --> 00:11:07,815
She took the other car.

218
00:11:08,038 --> 00:11:09,892
This is Italian leather, so...

219
00:11:11,525 --> 00:11:12,652
I... Oh, come...

220
00:11:14,173 --> 00:11:15,862
I'm sorry
about that murder house thing.

221
00:11:16,415 --> 00:11:18,573
That was my bad.
That's on me.

222
00:11:18,935 --> 00:11:19,699
New plan.

223
00:11:20,164 --> 00:11:22,354
You, my friend, are gonna build

224
00:11:22,479 --> 00:11:24,202
the Statue of Liberty

225
00:11:24,719 --> 00:11:25,663
a husband.

226
00:11:25,831 --> 00:11:28,082
Now, I got some suction down
at City Hall.

227
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:29,246
Stop it!

228
00:11:29,371 --> 00:11:31,747
I don't want your help, okay?
You don't have to do this.

229
00:11:31,962 --> 00:11:33,122
- Yes, I do.
- Why?

230
00:11:33,297 --> 00:11:34,297
Because...

231
00:11:36,616 --> 00:11:39,602
when you were with Stella,
I know how much I missed her.

232
00:11:40,372 --> 00:11:42,718
I can only imagine you feel
the same way.

233
00:11:45,087 --> 00:11:46,861
Let me put your mind at ease.

234
00:11:47,416 --> 00:11:48,937
I don't want Stella back, okay?

235
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:51,906
She lied to me
and left me at the altar.

236
00:11:52,031 --> 00:11:53,441
What kind of person does that?

237
00:11:54,065 --> 00:11:55,596
I'm better off without her.

238
00:11:55,939 --> 00:11:57,195
She's all yours, buddy.

239
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:02,696
There you go.

240
00:12:02,821 --> 00:12:04,284
Load off my mind.

241
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:06,667
<i>And that was it. Tony left,</i>

242
00:12:06,792 --> 00:12:09,379
<i>and I began to put this whole
business far behind me.</i>

243
00:12:09,504 --> 00:12:10,726
<i>Or so I thought.</i>

244
00:12:15,390 --> 00:12:17,006
Tony broke up with me.

245
00:12:25,311 --> 00:12:26,699
Tony broke up with you?

246
00:12:26,867 --> 00:12:29,180
He said it was
because of something you said.

247
00:12:29,369 --> 00:12:31,245
You got Tony to dump Stella?

248
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:34,119
I am very sorry,
but I'm going to have to insist

249
00:12:34,244 --> 00:12:35,457
that you bump this.

250
00:12:37,194 --> 00:12:38,919
Let's talk out in the hall.

251
00:12:40,630 --> 00:12:41,998
It'll be waiting.

252
00:12:44,143 --> 00:12:46,556
So, why are you here?

253
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:51,830
Look, Ted, this is about
seven months too late,

254
00:12:51,955 --> 00:12:53,314
but here goes.

255
00:12:54,825 --> 00:12:57,104
I've been in love with Tony
since high school.

256
00:12:58,148 --> 00:13:00,263
We dated for a long time,
but then...

257
00:13:00,388 --> 00:13:03,139
I got pregnant,
and I guess for two 19-year-olds

258
00:13:03,264 --> 00:13:05,756
it was just too much to handle,
so we broke up.

259
00:13:06,138 --> 00:13:09,765
And for a long time I just
focused on being a mother.

260
00:13:09,890 --> 00:13:12,090
I forgot about Tony.
I forgot about...

261
00:13:13,452 --> 00:13:15,680
the very idea of being in love.

262
00:13:17,643 --> 00:13:19,926
And then you came along
and reminded me.

263
00:13:20,731 --> 00:13:22,004
And I loved you for that.

264
00:13:23,948 --> 00:13:26,897
I loved you so much, in fact,
that it was just...

265
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,386
shy of enough.

266
00:13:31,954 --> 00:13:33,841
But I never stopped loving Tony.

267
00:13:35,518 --> 00:13:38,054
Take him back, honey.
He's sorry.

268
00:13:38,688 --> 00:13:40,961
No, that's not...
that's not what's happening.

269
00:13:41,086 --> 00:13:43,192
Just go back inside, Mrs. Matsen.

270
00:13:47,543 --> 00:13:50,616
- It was good seeing you, Stella.
- Can you talk to Tony?

271
00:13:53,853 --> 00:13:54,603
What?

272
00:13:54,788 --> 00:13:56,042
He'd listen to you.

273
00:13:56,167 --> 00:13:58,379
You changed his mind.
You could change it back.

274
00:13:58,504 --> 00:14:00,042
I know it's an awful thing to ask...

275
00:14:00,210 --> 00:14:02,377
Yeah, it's an awful thing to ask.

276
00:14:02,606 --> 00:14:04,544
I don't know what else to do, okay?

277
00:14:04,669 --> 00:14:05,606
I love him.

278
00:14:06,481 --> 00:14:07,504
You love him.

279
00:14:07,629 --> 00:14:10,219
So what, you're-you're appealing
to the romantic in me?

280
00:14:10,902 --> 00:14:12,179
Is that your strategy?

281
00:14:12,669 --> 00:14:14,306
Because that guy's gone.

282
00:14:14,670 --> 00:14:16,419
You can't pull
those strings anymore.

283
00:14:16,544 --> 00:14:19,277
They're not attached
to anything thanks to you.

284
00:14:19,896 --> 00:14:21,675
Go ahead, honey, kiss him!

285
00:14:21,856 --> 00:14:23,899
- Go inside, Mrs. Matsen!
- Mrs. Matsen, go inside!

286
00:14:26,424 --> 00:14:28,724
Okay, you can do this.
You can do this!

287
00:14:30,176 --> 00:14:32,253
Oh, you can do this.

288
00:14:33,494 --> 00:14:35,577
- License and regis...
- License and registration.

289
00:14:35,745 --> 00:14:37,079
Excuse me?

290
00:14:37,247 --> 00:14:40,436
I can only assume you need a license
to have a face that beautiful.

291
00:14:40,991 --> 00:14:42,191
And that body?

292
00:14:42,554 --> 00:14:45,678
I'm guessing something that
explosive has to be registered

293
00:14:45,803 --> 00:14:47,607
with the proper authorities.

294
00:14:48,299 --> 00:14:49,424
Get out of the car.

295
00:14:49,618 --> 00:14:51,570
Why, am I under arrest?

296
00:14:56,834 --> 00:14:58,934
But you're about to be under me.

297
00:15:03,023 --> 00:15:04,815
No. False.
Did not happen.

298
00:15:04,983 --> 00:15:07,684
That's a line from a porno.
I've seen that porno.

299
00:15:07,809 --> 00:15:09,908
Hell, I've made that porno.

300
00:15:10,521 --> 00:15:12,368
When will you realize
that the only difference

301
00:15:12,493 --> 00:15:15,435
between my real life and a porno
is my real life has better lighting?

302
00:15:15,618 --> 00:15:16,785
You're lying.

303
00:15:16,953 --> 00:15:18,274
I am not lying!

304
00:15:18,609 --> 00:15:20,747
I swear on my mother.

305
00:15:20,937 --> 00:15:23,062
I swear on Goliath National Bank.

306
00:15:23,187 --> 00:15:24,876
I swear on my suits.

307
00:15:25,001 --> 00:15:25,749
I...

308
00:15:25,874 --> 00:15:26,841
am...

309
00:15:26,966 --> 00:15:27,813
not...

310
00:15:28,064 --> 00:15:28,912
lying.

311
00:15:29,037 --> 00:15:31,341
<i>He was lying.
Here's what really happened.</i>

312
00:15:31,782 --> 00:15:33,551
Go ahead, honey, kiss him.

313
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:35,762
- Go inside, Mrs. Matsen!
- Mrs. Matsen, go inside!

314
00:15:39,408 --> 00:15:41,935
Is there anything I can do
to make this better?

315
00:15:48,318 --> 00:15:50,903
It's me! It's Barney. It's me!
I need your help! I'm in big trouble!

316
00:15:51,802 --> 00:15:53,197
Slow down. What happened?

317
00:15:54,383 --> 00:15:56,995
I'm guessing something
that explosive hasto be registered

318
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:58,906
with the proper authorities.

319
00:15:59,747 --> 00:16:02,687
- Get out of the car.
- Why, am I under arrest?

320
00:16:03,041 --> 00:16:06,119
Yes, you are. I ran your plates.
You've had 15 moving violations

321
00:16:06,244 --> 00:16:08,753
in the last three days.
Get out of the car.

322
00:16:09,042 --> 00:16:10,839
But no, my wife's having a baby!

323
00:16:11,510 --> 00:16:13,842
- I have a sausage with your name on it!
- Out of the car now!

324
00:16:15,053 --> 00:16:17,637
I need you to come
to Brazzaville, New Jersey

325
00:16:17,762 --> 00:16:18,764
and bail me out.

326
00:16:19,115 --> 00:16:20,515
I'm in the middle of something.

327
00:16:20,683 --> 00:16:22,236
Hurry, Ted. You have no idea

328
00:16:22,361 --> 00:16:24,853
of the kind of the hardened criminals
they've got me in here with.

329
00:16:25,298 --> 00:16:27,356
Are we gonna get
our spray paint back?

330
00:16:28,398 --> 00:16:29,602
Save me, Ted!

331
00:16:31,703 --> 00:16:34,613
You want to do something for me?
I need a ride to New Jersey.

332
00:16:36,533 --> 00:16:38,466
You'll pay for tolls, right?

333
00:16:38,868 --> 00:16:40,289
I'm kidding.

334
00:16:41,894 --> 00:16:44,394
<i>So Stella and I drove
all the way out to New Jersey,</i>

335
00:16:44,519 --> 00:16:46,269
<i>bailed your Uncle Barney out of jail</i>

336
00:16:46,394 --> 00:16:47,771
<i>and drove all the way home.</i>

337
00:16:47,896 --> 00:16:49,779
By the way, how's
that girl you've been seeing?

338
00:16:49,904 --> 00:16:52,769
That super hot French chick
with the big enormous boobs?

339
00:16:53,522 --> 00:16:55,052
Oh, you mean Claudette?

340
00:16:55,291 --> 00:16:56,748
She's... fine.

341
00:16:56,873 --> 00:17:00,166
Man, she's the hottest girl
you have ever been with, Ted.

342
00:17:00,584 --> 00:17:01,390
Ever!

343
00:17:09,438 --> 00:17:11,358
I'm so sorry again about everything.

344
00:17:12,905 --> 00:17:14,736
- For what it's worth...
- I'll talk to Tony.

345
00:17:15,641 --> 00:17:16,571
Really?

346
00:17:17,213 --> 00:17:19,263
I want you to be happy, Stella.

347
00:17:19,902 --> 00:17:21,363
I'll talk to him.

348
00:17:21,488 --> 00:17:22,286
<i>And I did.</i>

349
00:17:23,218 --> 00:17:26,452
<i>I don't remember what I said to him,
but I guess I changed his mind</i>

350
00:17:26,577 --> 00:17:28,103
<i>because the next day,</i>

351
00:17:29,467 --> 00:17:30,961
<i>they flew to California.</i>

352
00:17:31,466 --> 00:17:34,032
<i>Stella set up
a new dermatology practice.</i>

353
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:37,753
<i>And against all odds, Tony found
some success as a screenwriter.</i>

354
00:17:38,031 --> 00:17:40,944
<i>His movie, </i>The Wedding Bride,
<i>was a big hit.</i>

355
00:17:41,273 --> 00:17:42,740
<i>But we'll get to that later.</i>

356
00:17:43,308 --> 00:17:44,595
But just tell me this.

357
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:45,934
Why Tony?

358
00:17:46,294 --> 00:17:49,097
I mean, is it the money,
the kung fu pajamas?

359
00:17:49,272 --> 00:17:50,907
Like, what...
what is it?

360
00:17:52,228 --> 00:17:53,439
He's the one.

361
00:17:56,070 --> 00:17:57,195
The one.

362
00:17:57,597 --> 00:18:00,189
Yeah, I know it's kinda sappy,
but, yeah.

363
00:18:04,970 --> 00:18:07,023
I'm gonna say something
out loud that I've been doing

364
00:18:07,148 --> 00:18:09,786
a pretty good job of not
saying out loud lately.

365
00:18:12,195 --> 00:18:13,800
What you and Tony have...

366
00:18:14,809 --> 00:18:17,090
What I thought for a second
you and I had...

367
00:18:18,426 --> 00:18:20,886
What I know that Marshall
and Lily have...

368
00:18:23,358 --> 00:18:24,700
I want that.

369
00:18:25,614 --> 00:18:26,614
I do.

370
00:18:27,811 --> 00:18:30,541
I keep waiting for it to happen
and waiting for it to happen,

371
00:18:30,666 --> 00:18:31,666
and...

372
00:18:33,364 --> 00:18:35,017
I guess I'm just...

373
00:18:36,589 --> 00:18:37,778
I'm tired of waiting.

374
00:18:40,823 --> 00:18:43,601
And that is all I'm going
to say on that subject.

375
00:18:49,434 --> 00:18:51,291
I once talked my way
out of a speeding ticket?

376
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:52,501
Really?

377
00:18:53,315 --> 00:18:55,045
I was heading upstate
to my parents' house

378
00:18:55,170 --> 00:18:57,941
doing, like, 90 on this country road,
and I got pulled over.

379
00:18:58,066 --> 00:19:00,071
So this cop gets out of his car.

380
00:19:00,196 --> 00:19:02,444
He kind of swaggers on over
and he's, like,

381
00:19:02,569 --> 00:19:05,013
"Young lady,
I have been waiting for you all day."

382
00:19:06,667 --> 00:19:08,322
So I looked up at him and I said,

383
00:19:08,447 --> 00:19:11,311
"I'm so sorry, Officer.
I got here as fast as I could."

384
00:19:12,554 --> 00:19:13,397
For real?

385
00:19:15,582 --> 00:19:16,756
It's an old joke.

386
00:19:20,194 --> 00:19:22,687
I know that you're tired of waiting,

387
00:19:23,406 --> 00:19:26,354
and you may have to wait
a little while more,

388
00:19:27,689 --> 00:19:29,037
but she's on her way, Ted.

389
00:19:31,196 --> 00:19:34,372
And she's getting here
as fast as she can.

390
00:20:19,089 --> 00:20:22,053
She tracked me down two days
later using a phone book.

391
00:20:22,178 --> 00:20:25,291
And that's the last time I wrote
my name in my undergarments.

392
00:20:29,933 --> 00:20:31,093
You're back!

393
00:20:32,618 --> 00:20:35,119
When you told me
that peanut butter and jam joke,

394
00:20:35,244 --> 00:20:37,220
I was completely disgusted.

395
00:20:37,695 --> 00:20:40,556
But I was in the shower this morning
and it popped into my head

396
00:20:40,681 --> 00:20:43,037
and it actually made me laugh.

397
00:20:43,419 --> 00:20:44,623
Peanut butter.

398
00:20:45,316 --> 00:20:48,408
So I can see now
how I may have overreacted.

399
00:20:48,533 --> 00:20:49,816
Marshall's words, not mine.

400
00:20:51,318 --> 00:20:52,902
It's good to see you again, Lily.

401
00:20:53,071 --> 00:20:54,060
Thanks.

402
00:20:54,247 --> 00:20:57,185
- So what have you been up to?
- I'm going to an amnesia ward

403
00:20:57,310 --> 00:20:59,875
with a bunch of photos
of my children and a wedding ring.

404
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,371
I'm gonna find the hottest
patient/my wife, and we are going...

405
00:21:03,539 --> 00:21:05,730
Okay, so that's good
enough for tonight.

406
00:21:05,855 --> 00:21:07,458
I gotta ease back into this.
