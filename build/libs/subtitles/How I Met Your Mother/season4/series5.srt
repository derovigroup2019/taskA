1
00:00:02,610 --> 00:00:05,010
- Hey.
Hey, guys, how's it going?

2
00:00:05,112 --> 00:00:07,205
- I'm just gonna finish this.
- You...

3
00:00:08,983 --> 00:00:11,008
We just had dinner
with Stella's sister and her fianc?.

4
00:00:11,118 --> 00:00:12,415
They're getting married before us.

5
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:14,579
Okay, you know how you've dreamt
about your perfect wedding day

6
00:00:14,689 --> 00:00:15,815
ever since you were a little girl?

7
00:00:15,923 --> 00:00:17,356
- Yeah.
- Totally.

8
00:00:17,458 --> 00:00:19,722
My sister is stealing my dream wedding.

9
00:00:19,827 --> 00:00:23,285
Down to every last detail,
on Shelter Island, at sunset...

10
00:00:23,698 --> 00:00:27,759
...just down the beach
from our family's old summer house.

11
00:00:27,869 --> 00:00:32,033
- It's my dream wedding.
- I'm gonna finish this.

12
00:00:34,475 --> 00:00:37,809
- The lamb here is supposed to be great.
- I'm a vegan.

13
00:00:37,913 --> 00:00:40,381
I wish I could tune out
that moral voice inside me

14
00:00:40,482 --> 00:00:42,973
that says eating animals is murder,

15
00:00:43,085 --> 00:00:46,350
but I guess
I'm just not as strong as you are.

16
00:00:46,455 --> 00:00:48,719
That's 'cause you need protein.

17
00:00:49,591 --> 00:00:51,286
I'll have the lamb.

18
00:00:53,228 --> 00:00:57,528
Okay, new goal, I want our wedding
to kick her wedding's ass.

19
00:00:57,633 --> 00:00:59,794
I want our wedding
to take her wedding's head

20
00:00:59,902 --> 00:01:02,530
and shove it in the toilet
and flush it, like, 20 times.

21
00:01:02,638 --> 00:01:06,165
Ted, in high school,
you were her wedding, weren't you?

22
00:01:07,676 --> 00:01:09,576
You know, she's always trying
to one-up me.

23
00:01:09,678 --> 00:01:11,669
I mean, I love her,
but there's a little part of me

24
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:13,714
that kind of wishes
this whole thing would just fall apart.

25
00:01:14,283 --> 00:01:17,047
I hate him. I hate him. I hate him!

26
00:01:17,152 --> 00:01:20,087
God, this steak is so good!
Four days to go and he just runs off

27
00:01:20,188 --> 00:01:22,281
with a vitamin consultant
from Whole Foods?

28
00:01:22,391 --> 00:01:25,519
I gave up make-up for him.
I gave up showering for him.

29
00:01:25,627 --> 00:01:29,893
- I gave up shaving my armpits for him.
- Hard to imagine where it all went wrong.

30
00:01:30,332 --> 00:01:31,629
And now it's so close to the wedding...

31
00:01:31,733 --> 00:01:34,031
There's like bacon or something
in this dipping sauce. I love it.

32
00:01:34,136 --> 00:01:37,264
I can't get any refunds.
I'm gonna be out thousands of dollars.

33
00:01:37,372 --> 00:01:39,237
<i>Kids,
when you're in a relationship,</i>

34
00:01:39,341 --> 00:01:41,935
<i>you develop a kind of telepathy
with your partner.</i>

35
00:01:42,311 --> 00:01:45,303
<i>What do you think?
We could help her out.</i>

36
00:01:45,414 --> 00:01:48,384
<i>No, Stella, we should help her out.</i>

37
00:01:49,752 --> 00:01:51,515
<i>Let's pay for dinner.</i>

38
00:01:52,622 --> 00:01:56,490
Nora, don't worry. We got this.

39
00:01:57,093 --> 00:01:58,151
That's right.

40
00:01:58,261 --> 00:02:01,128
We'll take over your wedding,
pay you back for everything you spent.

41
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:03,892
Ted and I will get married this Sunday.

42
00:02:22,685 --> 00:02:27,782
Wow! We're getting married this Sunday?
Are we sure we're ready for this?

43
00:02:27,890 --> 00:02:30,484
Ted, I wasted years
trying to get Lucy's dad

44
00:02:30,593 --> 00:02:34,256
to decide he was ready for this,
but he never got ready for this.

45
00:02:34,364 --> 00:02:38,596
That's why we never got married.
Come on, let's just be spontaneous.

46
00:02:38,701 --> 00:02:42,364
I used to dream
that Tony would be spontaneous like this.

47
00:02:42,472 --> 00:02:46,499
Okay, I'm in. And I'm also spontaneous.

48
00:02:51,047 --> 00:02:53,106
I wish I hadn't done that.

49
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:56,946
Kids, morals usually come
at the end of stories,

50
00:02:57,053 --> 00:02:59,750
but this one is so important,
I'm gonna tell you now.

51
00:02:59,857 --> 00:03:02,553
Don't ever, ever invite
an ex to your wedding.

52
00:03:02,993 --> 00:03:06,292
<i>If someone had given me that advice,
well, it would have changed everything.</i>

53
00:03:06,397 --> 00:03:08,627
Come on, you've got to come.
It's my wedding.

54
00:03:08,732 --> 00:03:10,563
I can't. I'm in Tokyo.

55
00:03:11,101 --> 00:03:13,968
It's my first week on the job.
I can't just take off.

56
00:03:14,371 --> 00:03:17,807
Plus, I'm finally doing serious news.

57
00:03:19,209 --> 00:03:20,938
<i>Robin was doing serious news.</i>

58
00:03:21,345 --> 00:03:23,677
<i>It was the number one English
news network in Japan.</i>

59
00:03:23,781 --> 00:03:25,681
<i>Of course, the news
is a little different over there.</i>

60
00:03:29,687 --> 00:03:34,818
The Federal Reserve Board voted
to leave interest rates unchanged.

61
00:03:35,459 --> 00:03:37,518
It's my wedding. You have to be there.

62
00:03:37,628 --> 00:03:40,222
Okay. Okay. I'll be there. I gotta go.

63
00:03:42,466 --> 00:03:43,490
Good evening.

64
00:03:46,036 --> 00:03:48,027
And I'm Robin Scherbatsky.

65
00:03:48,839 --> 00:03:51,569
Peace talks were stalled once again
in the Middle East.

66
00:03:51,675 --> 00:03:55,270
Despite a promising start
to the latest negotiations,

67
00:03:55,379 --> 00:03:58,007
talks foundered on security issues.

68
00:03:58,649 --> 00:04:00,549
- She's in.
- Yes.

69
00:04:00,651 --> 00:04:02,676
All right, Ted,
your bachelor party, tonight.

70
00:04:02,786 --> 00:04:03,844
I have got three of the most

71
00:04:03,954 --> 00:04:07,754
physically and morally flexible
exotic dancers you've ever seen...

72
00:04:07,859 --> 00:04:09,724
- Can't. There's no time.
- Okay, I'll let you know how it goes.

73
00:04:09,828 --> 00:04:12,160
Marshall, we should really
rent the cars for tomorrow, huh?

74
00:04:12,263 --> 00:04:13,355
Sure.

75
00:04:17,001 --> 00:04:20,198
- What?
- No "Don't get married, Ted"?

76
00:04:20,305 --> 00:04:23,001
No "You're making a big mistake, Ted"?

77
00:04:23,108 --> 00:04:28,512
Barney Stinson, are you no longer
committed to the war on marriage?

78
00:04:28,613 --> 00:04:31,673
No, I just know a hopeless cause
when I see it.

79
00:04:31,783 --> 00:04:33,842
It's the same reason I don't recycle.

80
00:04:33,952 --> 00:04:38,889
Plus, Ted getting married
is in my best interest. You see,

81
00:04:39,624 --> 00:04:42,787
<i>lately I've been working on a problem
of the utmost importance.</i>

82
00:04:44,763 --> 00:04:46,492
<i>I confess I was stumped.</i>

83
00:04:46,598 --> 00:04:49,465
<i>Until one night I decided
to tackle it once and for all.</i>

84
00:05:03,815 --> 00:05:07,444
<i>Then, at last, I cracked the code.</i>

85
00:05:14,392 --> 00:05:17,259
- So you're back on Robin.
- Hopefully.

86
00:05:17,462 --> 00:05:19,624
I mean, this weekend
is the best chance ever

87
00:05:19,732 --> 00:05:21,131
to hook up with her again.

88
00:05:21,233 --> 00:05:24,066
You'll never pull it off.
There's too many distractions.

89
00:05:24,170 --> 00:05:26,195
The first drunk bridesmaid you see,

90
00:05:26,305 --> 00:05:30,002
you'll have your head under her dress
like an old-time photographer.

91
00:05:30,109 --> 00:05:32,373
Lily, don't cheapen this.

92
00:05:32,478 --> 00:05:36,414
I don't want to sound
all mushy-gushy and romantic,

93
00:05:36,515 --> 00:05:39,916
but this weekend,
Robin is the only woman I'm banging.

94
00:05:41,053 --> 00:05:42,077
<i>And so,
the day before our wedding,</i>

95
00:05:42,855 --> 00:05:46,086
<i>Stella and I made the trip
up to Shelter Island.</i>

96
00:05:46,192 --> 00:05:48,285
<i>With everyone else not far behind.</i>

97
00:05:48,828 --> 00:05:50,227
- Zitch dog.
- Zitch dog.

98
00:05:53,132 --> 00:05:56,067
This isn't exactly
where I pictured Ted getting married.

99
00:05:56,168 --> 00:05:59,365
"The Namast? Yoga
and Meditation Collective. "

100
00:05:59,471 --> 00:06:02,031
I don't know about you guys, but
nama-stay here any longer than I have to.

101
00:06:04,076 --> 00:06:07,045
All right, sweetie, go check in
with that dirty hippie over there

102
00:06:07,146 --> 00:06:09,171
and we'll get some drinks.

103
00:06:11,217 --> 00:06:13,913
So, what Scotches you got?

104
00:06:14,019 --> 00:06:17,546
Here at the Center,
we have a very strict no-alcohol policy.

105
00:06:19,625 --> 00:06:21,616
Great, and all the meals
are included, right?

106
00:06:21,727 --> 00:06:24,218
Yep, and they're all 100% vegan.

107
00:06:25,965 --> 00:06:31,404
No. I need alcohol.
I'm not gonna get Robin with this stuff.

108
00:06:31,738 --> 00:06:36,471
Look at this.
"Berry Blaster Brain Revitalizer. "

109
00:06:36,610 --> 00:06:39,238
My God, some of these drinks
could actually make a girl smarter.

110
00:06:39,346 --> 00:06:41,246
What sort of hell has Ted brought us to?

111
00:06:41,348 --> 00:06:44,374
- There's no meat.
- There's no alcohol.

112
00:06:45,018 --> 00:06:46,144
It gets worse.

113
00:06:46,253 --> 00:06:47,948
I'm 90% sure that guy
you were talking with

114
00:06:48,054 --> 00:06:50,522
used to be lead singer of the Spin Doctors.

115
00:06:52,626 --> 00:06:56,187
Hey, guys,
Stella and I have a little problem.

116
00:06:56,730 --> 00:06:58,925
All the programs look great.

117
00:06:59,032 --> 00:07:01,899
I mean, it's not our names on the front,
but otherwise, really nice.

118
00:07:02,002 --> 00:07:04,300
Hey, I talked to Robin.

119
00:07:04,404 --> 00:07:07,635
She's running a little bit late,
but she'll be here just under the wire.

120
00:07:07,741 --> 00:07:10,539
- You invited Robin?
- Yeah, of course.

121
00:07:10,644 --> 00:07:14,774
You never told me that.
I'm not sure how I feel about that.

122
00:07:14,881 --> 00:07:17,714
Can I help? You feel glad.

123
00:07:18,885 --> 00:07:22,616
- But you like Robin.
- Yeah, but she's your ex-girlfriend.

124
00:07:22,722 --> 00:07:23,950
- It's weird.
- It's not weird.

125
00:07:24,057 --> 00:07:25,285
It is weird.

126
00:07:25,392 --> 00:07:28,327
You don't get what it's like for a bride
to see her groom's ex at their wedding.

127
00:07:28,795 --> 00:07:30,285
Stella.

128
00:07:31,798 --> 00:07:35,063
Your new husband used to nail me,
like, three times a day.

129
00:07:38,172 --> 00:07:40,265
Having exes around...

130
00:07:40,374 --> 00:07:44,140
I don't know,
it brings up unresolved things.

131
00:07:44,812 --> 00:07:47,645
How do you know that that spark won't
come back with your ex sitting out there?

132
00:07:47,748 --> 00:07:51,149
Come on, we're just friends. Plus,
Robin and I already had our backslide,

133
00:07:51,252 --> 00:07:53,720
last Thanksgiving, not even that long ago.

134
00:07:53,821 --> 00:07:56,790
Did you place a large bet against yourself
in this argument?

135
00:07:56,891 --> 00:07:58,449
She already got her ticket.

136
00:07:58,559 --> 00:08:02,791
Ted, it's important to me. I mean,
I would never invite Lucy's dad.

137
00:08:02,897 --> 00:08:05,627
I wouldn't care if you did.
Tony's great. Let's invite him, too.

138
00:08:05,733 --> 00:08:09,260
No, Tony is the last person
I want at our wedding, okay?

139
00:08:10,838 --> 00:08:13,398
And Robin is a close second.

140
00:08:15,443 --> 00:08:17,377
Robin's probably about to get on the plane.

141
00:08:17,478 --> 00:08:19,878
Plus, she left a really important job
for this.

142
00:08:19,981 --> 00:08:25,044
Spurred by environmental concerns
and high gasoline prices,

143
00:08:25,152 --> 00:08:29,589
sales of hybrid vehicles
have risen 11% over the previous year.

144
00:08:30,091 --> 00:08:31,422
What should I do?

145
00:08:31,525 --> 00:08:34,688
I don't know.
I kind of get the "no exes" thing.

146
00:08:34,795 --> 00:08:37,525
Why ask a failed romance
to come and watch your successful one?

147
00:08:37,631 --> 00:08:40,361
You know, it's like inviting the
Seattle Mariners to a World Series game.

148
00:08:40,468 --> 00:08:42,402
It's just weird for everyone.

149
00:08:42,503 --> 00:08:46,371
- What? No. Robin has to come.
- Right. She's like my best friend.

150
00:08:46,474 --> 00:08:47,566
- Hey!
- Whoa!

151
00:08:47,675 --> 00:08:49,371
Female friend. My best female friend.

152
00:08:49,478 --> 00:08:51,969
Hey! Whoa! I don't care. Why fake it?

153
00:08:53,315 --> 00:08:56,284
- Dude, Robin has to be here.
- She shouldn't come.

154
00:08:56,385 --> 00:08:59,786
- What are you...
- Justice Aldrin, tie-breaking vote.

155
00:09:01,089 --> 00:09:06,288
Okay, wouldn't feel right without Robin.
But you don't mess with the bride.

156
00:09:06,995 --> 00:09:08,053
I'm gonna tell her not to come.

157
00:09:08,163 --> 00:09:10,256
- No, Ted.
- It's the right decision, Ted.

158
00:09:10,365 --> 00:09:12,458
This is gonna be, like,
the worst phone conversation of all time.

159
00:09:13,802 --> 00:09:16,703
Ted, Ted, Ted. Co-best man, I'm on it.

160
00:09:22,744 --> 00:09:24,575
- Hello?
- Robin, where are you?

161
00:09:24,679 --> 00:09:26,943
Just heading to the airport.

162
00:09:27,249 --> 00:09:30,013
Okay, we'll see you soon.
Have a great flight.

163
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:36,489
Bad news. I couldn't reach her.
Robin's already on her way.

164
00:09:41,830 --> 00:09:45,129
Okay, Robin's on her way.
You know what? I'm glad.

165
00:09:45,233 --> 00:09:47,360
Exes should be allowed
to come to weddings.

166
00:09:47,469 --> 00:09:49,562
I'll just tell Stella she's got to deal with it.

167
00:09:49,671 --> 00:09:53,107
I think you need to be more delicate
with Stella about this whole Robin thing.

168
00:09:53,208 --> 00:09:54,436
What do you mean by delicate?

169
00:09:54,543 --> 00:09:57,341
Brides are under a lot of stress
before a wedding.

170
00:09:57,446 --> 00:09:59,915
I mean, of course,
I held it together pretty well.

171
00:10:02,785 --> 00:10:03,774
You don't remember?

172
00:10:05,888 --> 00:10:10,882
The florist just told me the roses are more
light medium pink than medium pink.

173
00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:14,923
Light medium pink! Everything's ruined.

174
00:10:16,532 --> 00:10:21,196
Our wedding site uses a gravity furnace
instead of forced-air heating.

175
00:10:21,304 --> 00:10:25,900
That's the one thing I cared about.
Why are we even getting married?

176
00:10:28,177 --> 00:10:33,012
Blobbity-blah. Wickity-wah.
Eeky, eeky, eeky, eeky whee!

177
00:10:35,384 --> 00:10:37,545
After a while, it's all noise.

178
00:10:38,354 --> 00:10:41,790
Poor Stella's had to jam months of crazy
into just three days.

179
00:10:41,891 --> 00:10:42,983
So what do I do?

180
00:10:43,092 --> 00:10:46,789
You wait for the next crisis,
you solve it, you're a hero.

181
00:10:46,896 --> 00:10:50,059
Then you bring up the Robin thing,
but this time she'll say yes.

182
00:10:50,166 --> 00:10:51,827
Yeah, but what if there's no next crisis?

183
00:10:53,136 --> 00:10:56,367
She's a bride. There will be a next crisis.

184
00:10:59,208 --> 00:11:02,439
- There's a next crisis.
- Awesome! What is it?

185
00:11:02,545 --> 00:11:05,810
My daughter, my own daughter
isn't coming to our wedding.

186
00:11:05,915 --> 00:11:07,007
What?

187
00:11:07,483 --> 00:11:08,712
Tony's supposed
to drive her up tomorrow,

188
00:11:08,819 --> 00:11:11,947
but now he's being all petty about me
getting married, and he won't do it.

189
00:11:12,055 --> 00:11:14,888
It's been five years.
Why can't we just move on already?

190
00:11:15,359 --> 00:11:18,192
So first thing tomorrow
I drive down, talk to him,

191
00:11:18,295 --> 00:11:21,856
get him to let me drive Lucy up,
then, boom, crisis solved.

192
00:11:21,965 --> 00:11:24,593
Stella's happy.
Robin comes to the wedding.

193
00:11:25,569 --> 00:11:28,504
- Hey. You Barney?
- Yes.

194
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:31,130
I hear you're a real man whore,
so listen up.

195
00:11:31,241 --> 00:11:34,699
Tomorrow night I want to do things
so dirty and so depraved

196
00:11:34,811 --> 00:11:37,507
that I forget that this
was supposed to be my wedding.

197
00:11:37,781 --> 00:11:41,080
- I'm kind of here with someone.
- Bring her.

198
00:11:42,286 --> 00:11:44,117
You're never going to make it.

199
00:11:45,856 --> 00:11:47,414
<i>So,
the morning of my wedding day,</i>

200
00:11:47,524 --> 00:11:50,823
<i>I made the trip back
to Tony's house to get Lucy.</i>

201
00:11:53,864 --> 00:11:55,923
- Hey!
- Tony!

202
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:58,493
Doing a little karate?

203
00:12:00,938 --> 00:12:04,738
Sorry, sorry, man.
You just set off my internal defense alarm.

204
00:12:04,841 --> 00:12:07,309
You got to watch these things.
Stay alert, stay alive.

205
00:12:07,411 --> 00:12:09,538
- Right.
- So what brings you here?

206
00:12:09,646 --> 00:12:11,238
I thought you'd be off
in some honeymoon suite

207
00:12:11,348 --> 00:12:12,838
with my woman right now.

208
00:12:12,950 --> 00:12:15,942
- Not yet. Soon.
- That's right, tonight's the night.

209
00:12:16,053 --> 00:12:19,251
Yeah! Man,
you are going to be sticking it

210
00:12:19,357 --> 00:12:21,222
to the mother of my child.

211
00:12:21,326 --> 00:12:23,453
Actually, I've already stuck it to her
plenty of times.

212
00:12:23,561 --> 00:12:26,758
- Why do I always have to correct people?
- Man, you and Stella.

213
00:12:26,864 --> 00:12:30,300
You lucky dog. I could just...

214
00:12:33,738 --> 00:12:35,729
I'm so happy for you guys.

215
00:12:36,874 --> 00:12:40,071
Yeah. Hey, listen. Here's the thing. Lucy...

216
00:12:40,178 --> 00:12:42,112
- You can't take her.
- Tony, stop.

217
00:12:42,213 --> 00:12:45,410
Look, this is a big day for Lucy, too.

218
00:12:45,516 --> 00:12:47,006
You're going to have to put aside
your own issues

219
00:12:47,118 --> 00:12:50,087
and think about what's best for her here.
Whether you like it or not,

220
00:12:50,221 --> 00:12:54,419
she really should be at her mother's
wedding. So, I'm taking Lucy with me.

221
00:12:58,696 --> 00:13:01,995
You're right, man. You're right.

222
00:13:02,467 --> 00:13:06,028
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
It's just, seeing you guys,

223
00:13:07,105 --> 00:13:09,596
it's made me realize
everything I had.

224
00:13:09,974 --> 00:13:13,569
Hey, hey, hey. Let's stop hugging.

225
00:13:14,746 --> 00:13:19,115
I'm sorry.
It's just, Lucy means the world to me.

226
00:13:19,217 --> 00:13:21,310
And I feel like I'm losing her
to this new family,

227
00:13:21,419 --> 00:13:23,785
- a family I'm not even a part of.
- Come on, sure you are.

228
00:13:23,888 --> 00:13:26,015
No, I'm not.
I wasn't even invited to the wedding.

229
00:13:26,124 --> 00:13:27,591
Well, you are now.

230
00:13:27,692 --> 00:13:28,660
Thank you!

231
00:13:31,897 --> 00:13:33,159
Road trip.

232
00:13:34,366 --> 00:13:35,333
Right?

233
00:13:38,804 --> 00:13:40,965
Road trip two, back in the car.

234
00:13:43,442 --> 00:13:47,401
So, today's the day. You hydrating?

235
00:13:47,913 --> 00:13:50,746
Dear female, thank you
for your interest in Barney Stinson.

236
00:13:50,849 --> 00:13:52,976
Your back is going to look
like a Jackson Pollock.

237
00:13:54,286 --> 00:13:56,982
I regret to inform you that at this time...

238
00:13:57,089 --> 00:13:59,649
I was a vegan for two years. I need meat.

239
00:14:00,859 --> 00:14:03,521
...there are currently
no positions available.

240
00:14:03,629 --> 00:14:06,427
I'm a yoga instructor.
Every position is available.

241
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:10,725
Your room, 20 minutes. No foreplay.

242
00:14:13,472 --> 00:14:15,963
- I'm not going to make it, am I?
- Not a chance.

243
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:23,878
Okay, just remember,
let me talk to Stella first, okay?

244
00:14:23,982 --> 00:14:27,383
Mommy! Mommy! Ted invited Daddy!

245
00:14:27,953 --> 00:14:32,515
Hi, sweetie. I missed you.
Give me just a sec, okay?

246
00:14:33,158 --> 00:14:34,785
Hey.
- Hey, Tony.

247
00:14:35,728 --> 00:14:37,389
- Hey.
- You invited Tony?

248
00:14:37,496 --> 00:14:38,759
To our wedding?

249
00:14:38,865 --> 00:14:41,857
Ted, we talked about this.
No exes at our wedding.

250
00:14:41,968 --> 00:14:46,598
- Why would you do this?
- Boy, what did Ted do this time?

251
00:14:53,012 --> 00:14:55,879
Ted, what is Robin doing here?
I thought I made myself clear.

252
00:14:55,982 --> 00:14:58,450
No exes at our wedding.

253
00:14:58,551 --> 00:15:02,544
- To be fair, your ex is here.
- You invited him!

254
00:15:02,655 --> 00:15:05,488
- Come on, it's not weird.
- It is weird.

255
00:15:05,592 --> 00:15:08,390
It's like things are not finished
between you two.

256
00:15:08,495 --> 00:15:11,089
And Tony...
I can't deal with Tony right now.

257
00:15:11,197 --> 00:15:13,028
Can you please go out there
and tell him to leave?

258
00:15:13,133 --> 00:15:15,226
You can make me the bad guy.

259
00:15:15,335 --> 00:15:18,930
I'll go talk to Robin
so she knows it's nothing personal.

260
00:15:19,239 --> 00:15:20,604
Okay.

261
00:15:20,707 --> 00:15:23,232
<i>And, kids, if I had just let Stella
talk to Robin,</i>

262
00:15:23,343 --> 00:15:24,571
<i>this whole story
might have ended differently.</i>

263
00:15:26,312 --> 00:15:27,506
I understand.

264
00:15:28,381 --> 00:15:29,541
I get it.

265
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:33,878
<i>For the first time,
Ted and Stella Mosby.</i>

266
00:15:34,754 --> 00:15:36,949
And that's
how I met your mother.

267
00:15:37,390 --> 00:15:40,086
Blah, blah, blah.
Is your dad finally done yakking?

268
00:15:40,193 --> 00:15:42,627
Now, come on, who wants ice cream?

269
00:15:43,596 --> 00:15:44,927
<i>But I didn't.</i>

270
00:15:45,031 --> 00:15:46,157
Look, can you talk to Tony?

271
00:15:46,266 --> 00:15:49,566
Robin flew all the way here from Tokyo.
I should talk to her.

272
00:15:50,571 --> 00:15:53,062
- Sure.
- Okay.

273
00:15:57,311 --> 00:15:58,300
- Hi.
- Hey.

274
00:15:58,412 --> 00:16:00,209
- Sorry about running off like that.
- It's okay.

275
00:16:00,314 --> 00:16:04,717
You would not believe the trip I just had.
I was on a plane for almost a full day.

276
00:16:04,819 --> 00:16:06,844
But it is worth it to see you get married.

277
00:16:06,954 --> 00:16:08,683
- How could I not be here...
- You can't come to the wedding.

278
00:16:08,789 --> 00:16:10,381
- Thank God.
- What?

279
00:16:10,491 --> 00:16:13,221
- Ted, it's weird.
- It's not weird.

280
00:16:13,327 --> 00:16:16,888
It is weird. Do you know how it feels
to be somebody's ex at their wedding?

281
00:16:16,997 --> 00:16:18,123
- Robin.
- Stella.

282
00:16:20,367 --> 00:16:22,164
Suck it, bitch. I win.

283
00:16:24,371 --> 00:16:28,899
- We broke up over a year ago.
- Yeah, but that's not that long ago.

284
00:16:29,009 --> 00:16:30,567
Watching you marry another woman

285
00:16:30,678 --> 00:16:33,909
isn't exactly something
I was looking forward to.

286
00:16:34,014 --> 00:16:36,539
I don't know, I just thought
if I ever changed my mind

287
00:16:36,650 --> 00:16:41,485
about marriage and kids, it was...
It was nice to know that you were there.

288
00:16:41,589 --> 00:16:43,489
So, I was your safety school.
How flattering.

289
00:16:43,591 --> 00:16:45,149
That's not it. It's just that...

290
00:16:45,259 --> 00:16:48,353
Why are you bringing any of this up?
There's nothing between us anymore.

291
00:16:48,462 --> 00:16:52,455
Well, maybe there is.
I mean, of course, there is.

292
00:16:52,566 --> 00:16:56,798
That kind of stuff just doesn't disappear
without a trace.

293
00:16:56,904 --> 00:16:59,271
Look, I'm not just another guest here, Ted.

294
00:16:59,374 --> 00:17:02,571
Right. We used to date,
but we both moved on.

295
00:17:02,677 --> 00:17:05,168
And, look, we got what we wanted.
I'm getting married.

296
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:07,043
You got your dream job in Tokyo.

297
00:17:07,148 --> 00:17:09,639
- And they all lived happily ever...
- I quit my job.

298
00:17:09,751 --> 00:17:12,242
- You what?
- I'm moving back to New York.

299
00:17:12,354 --> 00:17:17,849
I thought I wanted that job, but
I want to come back to my real life.

300
00:17:19,127 --> 00:17:24,121
- And I think you should go back to yours.
- What's that supposed to mean?

301
00:17:26,801 --> 00:17:31,204
Don't get married.
Look, you're rushing into this.

302
00:17:31,306 --> 00:17:34,605
It's like you're trying to skip ahead
to the end of the book.

303
00:17:34,709 --> 00:17:36,677
Ted, you're the most romantic guy I know.

304
00:17:36,778 --> 00:17:40,214
You stole a blue French horn for me.
You tried to make it rain.

305
00:17:40,315 --> 00:17:42,806
- I did make it rain.
- It was a coincidence.

306
00:17:42,918 --> 00:17:47,651
But after all that, this is how your
great romantic quest comes to an end?

307
00:17:47,756 --> 00:17:50,020
You're just disappearing
into someone else's wedding,

308
00:17:50,125 --> 00:17:54,562
someone else's house, someone else's life
without a second thought.

309
00:17:54,663 --> 00:17:57,689
That's not the amazing ending
that you deserve.

310
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:00,263
That's not Ted Mosby.

311
00:18:05,173 --> 00:18:06,640
I love Stella.

312
00:18:07,709 --> 00:18:10,873
She's the one. If you really feel that way,

313
00:18:12,582 --> 00:18:16,450
I guess it's a good thing
you're not coming to the wedding after all.

314
00:18:24,927 --> 00:18:27,259
- Big fight?
- Yeah.

315
00:18:28,164 --> 00:18:31,622
Here, it's on the house.

316
00:18:32,168 --> 00:18:33,965
Just keep them coming.

317
00:18:35,905 --> 00:18:38,100
Oh, God, do not keep them coming.

318
00:18:43,279 --> 00:18:48,717
- Hey, Robin.
- Barney. I am having a horrible day.

319
00:18:48,818 --> 00:18:50,877
I snuck some Scotch in
from the duty-free store.

320
00:18:50,987 --> 00:18:51,976
You want to join me?

321
00:18:52,088 --> 00:18:54,682
Yeah, yeah. Let's go to your room.
Far away from this room.

322
00:18:54,790 --> 00:18:57,452
- And we can knock it back.
- They didn't get me a room.

323
00:18:57,560 --> 00:19:00,329
I was actually hoping I could stay with you.

324
00:19:01,063 --> 00:19:05,557
No problem.
I just have to straighten up little bit.

325
00:19:05,668 --> 00:19:07,863
I've got some clothes on the floor, and...

326
00:19:10,906 --> 00:19:13,773
- A naked girl tied to your headboard.
- Towels all over the bathroom. It's a mess.

327
00:19:13,876 --> 00:19:17,004
So, anyway, give me 10 minutes
to get the place in order...

328
00:19:17,113 --> 00:19:18,604
See you, Barney.

329
00:19:18,915 --> 00:19:19,882
I...

330
00:19:21,251 --> 00:19:22,548
She...

331
00:19:31,061 --> 00:19:32,551
Okay, let's do this.

332
00:19:33,664 --> 00:19:35,427
Who the hell is that?

333
00:19:36,233 --> 00:19:37,996
It's the girl from the front desk.

334
00:19:40,037 --> 00:19:43,200
<i>Lovers, they try</i>

335
00:19:43,306 --> 00:19:47,299
<i>They try to whip the stars into compliance</i>

336
00:19:47,411 --> 00:19:51,006
<i>Kids, sometimes you think
you're living out one story,</i>

337
00:19:51,114 --> 00:19:53,844
<i>but the truth turns out to be
something else entirely.</i>

338
00:19:53,950 --> 00:19:57,977
<i>Don't want to knock the
planets out of alignment</i>

339
00:20:00,090 --> 00:20:03,218
<i>At the time, I thought the story was about
whether Robin should be at the wedding.</i>

340
00:20:05,996 --> 00:20:08,794
<i>You're gonna wait a long time</i>

341
00:20:08,899 --> 00:20:11,129
<i>Wait a long time</i>

342
00:20:11,234 --> 00:20:14,294
<i>If only I'd understood
what the real story was.</i>

343
00:20:19,109 --> 00:20:23,068
<i>If you're looking for an invitation</i>

344
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:28,379
Having exes around... I don't know,
it brings up unresolved things.

345
00:20:29,887 --> 00:20:32,981
<i>You're never gonna get one</i>

346
00:20:33,091 --> 00:20:34,524
How do you know that
that spark won't come back

347
00:20:34,625 --> 00:20:35,819
with your ex sitting out there?

348
00:20:39,530 --> 00:20:41,623
It's like things are not finished
between you two.

349
00:20:44,702 --> 00:20:48,968
I wasted years trying to get Lucy's dad
to decide he was ready for this.

350
00:20:49,340 --> 00:20:53,743
Seeing you guys,
it's made me realize everything I had.

351
00:20:54,178 --> 00:20:57,341
I used to dream
that Tony would be spontaneous like this.

352
00:20:58,316 --> 00:21:03,344
<i>Wait a long time, wait a long time</i>

353
00:21:03,454 --> 00:21:07,948
<i>Seriously, kids,
never invite an ex to your wedding.</i>
