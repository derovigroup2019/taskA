1
00:00:02,728 --> 00:00:04,090
<i>Why do we fight?</i>

2
00:00:04,369 --> 00:00:06,160
<i>What does that thing
deep within each of us,</i>

3
00:00:06,260 --> 00:00:09,222
<i>that compels us to settle
disagreements with our fists?</i>

4
00:00:09,587 --> 00:00:12,452
<i>Whatever it is,
it's there right from the beginning.</i>

5
00:00:13,364 --> 00:00:15,227
- Stop fighting!
- Why?

6
00:00:15,626 --> 00:00:17,723
Because it's stupid
and juvenile.

7
00:00:17,893 --> 00:00:20,423
We're six.
We are stupid and juvenile.

8
00:00:23,899 --> 00:00:26,297
<i>Kids, I've only been
in one fight in my life.</i>

9
00:00:26,467 --> 00:00:28,445
<i>And this is the story
of how it happened.</i>

10
00:00:28,615 --> 00:00:31,083
<i>Now, as you know,
I recently had been left at the altar.</i>

11
00:00:31,253 --> 00:00:33,327
<i>And the worst thing
about getting left at the altar?</i>

12
00:00:33,497 --> 00:00:35,833
<i>I mean, aside from
actually getting left at the altar,</i>

13
00:00:36,003 --> 00:00:37,332
<i>was what came next.</i>

14
00:00:37,582 --> 00:00:40,824
<i>A steady unrelenting
unbearable stream of pity.</i>

15
00:00:41,387 --> 00:00:43,250
Cranberry Gin and tonic.

16
00:00:45,955 --> 00:00:47,180
Scotch and soda.

17
00:00:49,635 --> 00:00:50,609
Thank you.

18
00:00:53,876 --> 00:00:55,215
Could I see a menu?

19
00:00:57,059 --> 00:00:59,007
I'm going to go get you a menu...

20
00:00:59,247 --> 00:01:00,591
but I promise you

21
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:02,612
I will come back.

22
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:07,968
We have to start
going someplace else.

23
00:01:08,166 --> 00:01:09,768
At this bar,
I'm always going to be

24
00:01:09,868 --> 00:01:12,960
the guy who got left at
the altar. That sucks!

25
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:14,239
Good times.

26
00:01:15,006 --> 00:01:16,742
- We lost Barney.
- What do you mean?

27
00:01:16,842 --> 00:01:19,046
There's a girl over there
in a tight red sweater.

28
00:01:19,216 --> 00:01:21,254
So he's not listening
to a word anyone's saying.

29
00:01:21,354 --> 00:01:22,347
Right, Barney?

30
00:01:22,447 --> 00:01:23,738
Give me a break!

31
00:01:23,838 --> 00:01:25,269
See, he figured out a while back

32
00:01:25,369 --> 00:01:26,921
he could fake an entire conversation

33
00:01:27,021 --> 00:01:29,848
just by saying titles of black sitcoms
from the 70's and 80's.

34
00:01:29,948 --> 00:01:31,197
What's happening?

35
00:01:32,609 --> 00:01:34,597
Want to go upstairs and do stuff to me

36
00:01:34,697 --> 00:01:36,386
that I won't even let Marshall do?

37
00:01:37,050 --> 00:01:39,089
Different strokes.

38
00:01:41,004 --> 00:01:42,261
What the hell is this?!

39
00:01:42,431 --> 00:01:44,142
<i>I've told you kids about Doug, right?</i>

40
00:01:44,312 --> 00:01:46,026
<i>I haven't?
Oh, well...</i>

41
00:01:46,735 --> 00:01:48,784
<i>Doug Martin was a bartender
at MacLaren's.</i>

42
00:01:48,924 --> 00:01:50,557
<i>He was always kind of around.</i>

43
00:01:50,657 --> 00:01:52,554
- Have... you met Ted?
- What?

44
00:01:52,654 --> 00:01:54,294
We're not playing
"Have you met Ted?".

45
00:01:54,394 --> 00:01:55,347
Am I dead?

46
00:01:56,016 --> 00:01:56,952
Am I dead?

47
00:01:57,470 --> 00:01:58,511
Tonight...

48
00:01:59,123 --> 00:02:00,586
I pick up a lesbian.

49
00:02:00,756 --> 00:02:03,443
<i>Anyway, three things
you need to know about Doug.</i>

50
00:02:03,613 --> 00:02:06,126
<i>The first thing is that Doug
had a bit of a violent streak.</i>

51
00:02:06,226 --> 00:02:07,977
...crumbled, so he's
on the ground, right?

52
00:02:08,077 --> 00:02:11,283
And we're just kicking him!
He's making that face, all shaking.

53
00:02:12,274 --> 00:02:15,212
So, anyway, what we did
was we left him there.

54
00:02:16,168 --> 00:02:17,195
Top you off?

55
00:02:18,335 --> 00:02:21,204
<i>The second thing is that
he was weird about his hair.</i>

56
00:02:22,242 --> 00:02:23,005
What?

57
00:02:23,431 --> 00:02:24,206
What?

58
00:02:24,699 --> 00:02:26,378
Are you looking at my hair?

59
00:02:26,796 --> 00:02:28,452
No, sir. I was not.

60
00:02:29,451 --> 00:02:30,576
It's a toupee.

61
00:02:32,227 --> 00:02:34,129
Is that funny?
You want to laugh it up?

62
00:02:34,272 --> 00:02:35,522
Is it funny, guy?
Is it?

63
00:02:35,622 --> 00:02:37,359
I'll tell you what,
why don't you grab it?

64
00:02:37,459 --> 00:02:38,952
- Excuse me?
- Go ahead, grab it.

65
00:02:39,052 --> 00:02:40,981
Grab it right off my head.
Go ahead.

66
00:02:41,627 --> 00:02:43,291
You don't want to grab it?
Come on.

67
00:02:43,461 --> 00:02:44,924
Come on, go ahead and grab it.

68
00:02:45,094 --> 00:02:48,367
Want to grab it off my head?
Grab my toupee right off my head.

69
00:02:53,782 --> 00:02:55,330
I like you guys!

70
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:59,393
<i>But the third thing is that
he was very loyal to his regulars.</i>

71
00:02:59,667 --> 00:03:02,414
There they are!
Hey, you guys want your booth?

72
00:03:02,814 --> 00:03:04,225
We're fine over here.

73
00:03:04,395 --> 00:03:05,904
<i>Maybe a little too loyal.</i>

74
00:03:06,004 --> 00:03:07,366
No, it's fine.

75
00:03:07,536 --> 00:03:09,772
Okay, you two lovebirds!
Let's take this somewhere else...

76
00:03:09,912 --> 00:03:11,164
booth's reserved.

77
00:03:11,843 --> 00:03:13,580
Let's go! Now! Come on!

78
00:03:13,709 --> 00:03:15,460
Let's see some hustle, Father.
Up you get.

79
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:17,896
Okay, guys, here we are!

80
00:03:18,066 --> 00:03:19,346
<i>So, that's Doug.</i>

81
00:03:19,582 --> 00:03:20,964
What the hell is this?!

82
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:22,982
Some guys are
sitting in our booth.

83
00:03:23,082 --> 00:03:25,124
But you know what?
This is fine.

84
00:03:28,083 --> 00:03:29,955
Let's go, I'll take care of it.

85
00:03:30,304 --> 00:03:32,195
Oh boy, there he goes.

86
00:03:39,735 --> 00:03:42,041
Ladies, if you'll please adjourn
to your usual booth.

87
00:03:42,211 --> 00:03:44,503
Gentlemen, I will require
your assistance outside.

88
00:03:44,646 --> 00:03:45,896
Our assistance with what?

89
00:03:45,996 --> 00:03:48,264
We're going to go out in the alley
and fight those guys.

90
00:03:48,903 --> 00:03:50,167
What's happening now?

91
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:53,660
Sync by vNaru

92
00:04:04,656 --> 00:04:06,471
I'm sorry, did you just say
we were gonna...

93
00:04:06,571 --> 00:04:08,996
Those guys are being
inconsiderate, okay?

94
00:04:09,166 --> 00:04:10,378
So we're going to go outside

95
00:04:10,548 --> 00:04:13,372
and cave in their skulls, okay?
This will be fun!

96
00:04:16,241 --> 00:04:18,113
He wants us to fight?
Like...

97
00:04:18,283 --> 00:04:20,119
Like, with our hands and stuff?

98
00:04:20,289 --> 00:04:22,947
And feet maybe?
I don't know what the rules are.

99
00:04:23,463 --> 00:04:25,775
A fight. Should we go out there?

100
00:04:26,001 --> 00:04:26,823
Come on, Ted.

101
00:04:26,993 --> 00:04:28,941
There's only three things
you'll ever see me fight:

102
00:04:29,111 --> 00:04:31,001
The stubborn clasp of a bra,

103
00:04:31,391 --> 00:04:34,001
sexual harassment charges...
nine for nine...

104
00:04:35,352 --> 00:04:38,886
And the urge to vomit when I see
someone wearing brown shoes

105
00:04:38,994 --> 00:04:40,410
with a black suit.

106
00:04:42,744 --> 00:04:45,389
Dude, fighting is for losers.
We're civilized guys.

107
00:04:45,495 --> 00:04:48,309
Civilized guys don't fight.
Unless it's with lightsabers.

108
00:04:48,411 --> 00:04:50,289
But that's like three
to five years away, so...

109
00:04:50,459 --> 00:04:51,941
Well, that's not true.

110
00:04:52,163 --> 00:04:53,947
Robin, I'm on the forums every day.

111
00:04:54,047 --> 00:04:55,471
Three to five Thanksgivings from now,

112
00:04:55,571 --> 00:04:58,193
I'm going to be carving
the turkey with Old Green.

113
00:04:59,291 --> 00:05:01,805
No, I'm saying there are plenty
of legitimate reasons

114
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:04,121
to get in a fight...
it might not be pretty,

115
00:05:04,291 --> 00:05:06,989
but in certain situations,
you gotta do what you gotta do.

116
00:05:07,091 --> 00:05:09,758
Right, I forgot.
She thinks fighting's sexy.

117
00:05:10,148 --> 00:05:12,236
No, I do not! A lot...

118
00:05:13,664 --> 00:05:15,552
Look, I come from a culture
of hockey players.

119
00:05:15,652 --> 00:05:19,438
If a guy can throw down,
it's somewhat way hot.

120
00:05:20,136 --> 00:05:22,112
And scars, hello!

121
00:05:22,282 --> 00:05:24,540
If a guy's got a scar,
he's got a Robin.

122
00:05:24,710 --> 00:05:27,374
And if he's missing teeth?
I'm missing my pants.

123
00:05:29,018 --> 00:05:30,914
I'm missing my wisdom teeth.

124
00:05:31,814 --> 00:05:33,332
Outpatient procedure.

125
00:05:33,590 --> 00:05:36,824
Local anesthesia.
Whatever. It ain't a thing.

126
00:05:38,279 --> 00:05:39,838
Maybe we should go out there.

127
00:05:40,008 --> 00:05:43,096
I can't believe we're even having
this discussion.

128
00:05:43,713 --> 00:05:46,605
You're 30,
you're too old to act like this.

129
00:05:46,775 --> 00:05:49,916
<i>I was 30 and in those 30 years
I'd been punched once.</i>

130
00:05:50,435 --> 00:05:52,619
There's a very simple explana...

131
00:05:53,183 --> 00:05:54,509
<i>There was that thing at camp.</i>

132
00:05:54,629 --> 00:05:57,655
Today, we're going to braid
friendship bracelets.

133
00:05:58,705 --> 00:06:01,033
<i>In college, I studied some Kung Fu.</i>

134
00:06:06,865 --> 00:06:09,013
<i>And well, there was
some other stuff.</i>

135
00:06:13,167 --> 00:06:15,289
<i>The thing with the goat wasn't
for another few months.</i>

136
00:06:15,766 --> 00:06:17,536
<i>The point is,
I had never been in a fight.</i>

137
00:06:17,706 --> 00:06:18,996
I'm going out there.

138
00:06:19,368 --> 00:06:20,244
Dude, listen to me,

139
00:06:20,414 --> 00:06:22,986
please, trust me, I've been
in plenty of fights. It's...

140
00:06:23,156 --> 00:06:24,854
really nothing to be proud of.

141
00:06:25,024 --> 00:06:26,930
Who did you get in a fight with?

142
00:06:27,398 --> 00:06:28,448
My brothers.

143
00:06:30,542 --> 00:06:33,962
I'm sure that was quite a rumble
in the Eriksen rumpus room.

144
00:06:35,114 --> 00:06:38,414
- I love brotherly horseplay!
- Here comes the tickle monster!

145
00:06:38,738 --> 00:06:40,166
Noogie patrol!

146
00:06:41,222 --> 00:06:43,640
Wait, wait, wait! Timesies! Timesies!

147
00:06:44,492 --> 00:06:45,524
Cocoa break.

148
00:06:49,636 --> 00:06:50,764
Cocoa break.

149
00:06:52,939 --> 00:06:54,391
It's clobbering time.

150
00:06:54,561 --> 00:06:55,932
Ted, don't do this.

151
00:06:56,102 --> 00:06:58,870
You're a nice guy.
That's your best quality.

152
00:06:59,040 --> 00:06:59,852
Is it?

153
00:06:59,952 --> 00:07:02,436
'Cause I seem to rember this nice guy
getting dumped by his fianc?e

154
00:07:02,536 --> 00:07:04,174
for a Tae Kwon Do instructor.

155
00:07:04,493 --> 00:07:06,297
Look, this may
sound crazy, but I...

156
00:07:06,397 --> 00:07:07,641
I think I need to do this.

157
00:07:07,741 --> 00:07:10,280
I think this is an experience
I need to have.

158
00:07:11,022 --> 00:07:11,979
I'm going.

159
00:07:16,227 --> 00:07:17,171
Me, too!

160
00:07:19,802 --> 00:07:20,628
Guys...

161
00:07:20,892 --> 00:07:22,493
take a good look at this face,

162
00:07:22,593 --> 00:07:24,067
because the next time you see it,

163
00:07:24,167 --> 00:07:27,325
it will be disfigured
in the hottest possible way.

164
00:07:27,825 --> 00:07:30,427
Because that's who I am...
I'm a man.

165
00:07:31,022 --> 00:07:34,416
I like to fight and mix it up
and get all dirty.

166
00:07:35,628 --> 00:07:37,903
Can you find
a wood hanger for this?

167
00:07:42,644 --> 00:07:44,893
- What happened here?
- I know, right?!

168
00:07:45,063 --> 00:07:47,304
Who's not looking at my toupee now?!

169
00:07:47,541 --> 00:07:49,103
Look what we did to these guys!

170
00:07:49,203 --> 00:07:50,604
- "We?"
- Yeah, "we."

171
00:07:50,704 --> 00:07:52,605
Come on, man,
we're a good team.

172
00:07:52,850 --> 00:07:54,386
Nice work boys! We did it!

173
00:07:54,556 --> 00:07:57,178
No you did it.
We didn't do anything.

174
00:07:59,095 --> 00:08:01,490
Sure, I just beat up
three guys by myself.

175
00:08:01,937 --> 00:08:04,865
You guys. That's good.
You and you...

176
00:08:06,204 --> 00:08:07,803
free drinks for life.

177
00:08:12,354 --> 00:08:14,150
He thinks we were in this fight
with him.

178
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:16,542
We were in this fight with him.

179
00:08:16,950 --> 00:08:19,019
And now we are going to go in there
and tell everyone

180
00:08:19,119 --> 00:08:22,024
the legendary tale
of how we beat up some guys.

181
00:08:22,124 --> 00:08:23,877
And everyone is going to think
it's great

182
00:08:23,977 --> 00:08:25,820
and everyone is going to sleep with me
again.

183
00:08:25,944 --> 00:08:28,431
Dude, come on, no one is gonna
believe we were in a fight...

184
00:08:28,531 --> 00:08:30,475
- look at us.
- That's a good...

185
00:08:31,883 --> 00:08:33,025
What are you doing?!

186
00:08:33,125 --> 00:08:34,876
What I should've done a long time ago.

187
00:08:34,976 --> 00:08:36,193
- What?
- I don't know,

188
00:08:36,293 --> 00:08:39,855
I just hit myself in the eye!
I don't even know what I'm saying...

189
00:08:40,763 --> 00:08:42,839
I throw an awesome right hook,
by the way.

190
00:08:43,009 --> 00:08:43,979
Okay, are you ready?

191
00:08:44,149 --> 00:08:45,923
- To go back in?
- No, for this.

192
00:08:48,779 --> 00:08:50,606
God! You just punched me in the nose!

193
00:08:50,776 --> 00:08:52,586
- Are you crying?
- Yes, I'm crying!

194
00:08:52,687 --> 00:08:54,592
You just punched me in the nose!

195
00:08:55,076 --> 00:08:57,764
That's going to swell up real good.
You're going to look like Owen Wilson.

196
00:08:57,864 --> 00:08:59,086
Let's get back in there.

197
00:08:59,186 --> 00:09:01,821
Okay, but just, let's just play
this down, okay?

198
00:09:01,921 --> 00:09:04,244
I don't want this to turn
into a big thing.

199
00:09:05,228 --> 00:09:06,630
<i>And Ted comes
and takes his shoe off!</i>

200
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:08,260
<i>Hits him in the mouth...</i>

201
00:09:08,430 --> 00:09:11,353
Hey, there they are!
The guys that got my back!

202
00:09:24,293 --> 00:09:26,972
You two got in a fight.
Really?

203
00:09:27,651 --> 00:09:29,473
Barney punched me
and himself in the face

204
00:09:29,573 --> 00:09:31,392
to make it look like we got in a fight.

205
00:09:31,492 --> 00:09:33,055
Come on, Marshall!

206
00:09:34,296 --> 00:09:35,543
Look at your eye.

207
00:09:35,961 --> 00:09:37,689
You look like a badass.

208
00:09:38,476 --> 00:09:41,159
I'm surprised to see you had it in me.
You.

209
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:42,964
Had it in you.

210
00:09:44,035 --> 00:09:45,076
Do you...

211
00:09:45,939 --> 00:09:47,292
want to touch it?

212
00:09:51,094 --> 00:09:52,740
Oh, my God, it's warm!

213
00:09:54,372 --> 00:09:56,362
Hey! Victory drinks!

214
00:09:57,351 --> 00:10:01,193
Free! Free!
Free! Free!

215
00:10:01,693 --> 00:10:02,759
$7.50.

216
00:10:03,944 --> 00:10:05,173
Why do I have to pay?

217
00:10:05,343 --> 00:10:06,975
'Cause you don't got my back.

218
00:10:07,638 --> 00:10:09,707
- These guys got my back.
- You know what, Doug?

219
00:10:09,807 --> 00:10:11,318
I will gladly pay.
And you know why?

220
00:10:11,418 --> 00:10:12,863
Because that's what grownups do.

221
00:10:13,033 --> 00:10:15,539
They pay for their drinks,
and they don't get into fights.

222
00:10:15,639 --> 00:10:18,250
You know what I was doing, while you
guys were out there being immature?

223
00:10:18,350 --> 00:10:20,388
- I'll tell you what I was doing.
- Your nails?

224
00:10:21,661 --> 00:10:23,370
- I was doing...
- The relationship quiz

225
00:10:23,470 --> 00:10:25,370
in this month's Cosmo?

226
00:10:25,719 --> 00:10:27,400
- I was doing...
- Your best not to cry

227
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:30,652
when Big came back for Carrie at
the end of the Sex and the Citymovie?

228
00:10:30,822 --> 00:10:32,162
Spoilers much?

229
00:10:32,872 --> 00:10:35,503
- I'll tell you what I was doing...
- The captain of the football team

230
00:10:35,603 --> 00:10:37,132
because he gave you his promise ring

231
00:10:37,232 --> 00:10:40,328
and you look so pretty
in your open back Homecoming dress?

232
00:10:42,896 --> 00:10:43,702
Sorry.

233
00:10:45,462 --> 00:10:46,907
I hate those guys!

234
00:10:47,185 --> 00:10:49,806
Acting like they're the manliest
guys in the universe,

235
00:10:49,976 --> 00:10:52,496
like they're Crocodile
Dundee and David Hasselhoff.

236
00:10:52,938 --> 00:10:54,912
Those are the manliest guys
in the universe?

237
00:10:55,012 --> 00:10:57,785
I don't understand why they're getting
all this attention. I mean,

238
00:10:57,955 --> 00:10:59,686
I'm the real hero here.

239
00:10:59,856 --> 00:11:01,671
- Yeah, you are.
- I'm serious, woman.

240
00:11:01,771 --> 00:11:03,423
Put it back in your pants.

241
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:08,803
You're the man every boy
should grow up to become

242
00:11:08,903 --> 00:11:10,941
and every girl should marry.

243
00:11:12,086 --> 00:11:13,162
You know what?

244
00:11:13,332 --> 00:11:15,771
I have two kids in my class
who won't stop fighting.

245
00:11:15,941 --> 00:11:17,746
If you come to school tomorrow and

246
00:11:17,871 --> 00:11:20,584
tell them your story of choosing
the path of nonviolence,

247
00:11:20,754 --> 00:11:22,715
it might really set them straight.

248
00:11:22,885 --> 00:11:26,039
And save me having to get up early
to make a lesson plan.

249
00:11:26,956 --> 00:11:27,916
All right.

250
00:11:29,198 --> 00:11:30,466
I'll set them straight.

251
00:11:30,696 --> 00:11:32,702
- You're a wuss.
- What?

252
00:11:34,367 --> 00:11:37,804
Mahatma Panda and Martin Luther Koala
are telling you kids this story

253
00:11:37,905 --> 00:11:40,708
- to illustrate...
- To illustrate that you're a wuss?

254
00:11:41,054 --> 00:11:43,173
Why didn't you just fight those guys?

255
00:11:43,343 --> 00:11:45,765
- Were you scared?
- What?

256
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:49,362
I wasn't scared!

257
00:11:49,698 --> 00:11:51,431
I've been in plenty of fights, okay?

258
00:11:51,556 --> 00:11:52,761
You're huge!

259
00:11:52,931 --> 00:11:55,287
You must weigh like a thousand pounds.

260
00:11:57,466 --> 00:12:00,557
First of all,
I'm wearing a baggy sweater,

261
00:12:00,806 --> 00:12:02,990
and it has horizontal stripes.

262
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:05,009
And I also...
and I had a salty lunch...

263
00:12:05,179 --> 00:12:07,298
And so I'm retain...
You know what? Shut up!

264
00:12:07,398 --> 00:12:08,340
Wuss!

265
00:12:16,115 --> 00:12:16,860
So,

266
00:12:17,330 --> 00:12:19,269
you just beat those guys up?

267
00:12:19,667 --> 00:12:20,480
Just?

268
00:12:22,206 --> 00:12:24,750
Amanda, were it so simple.
You see,

269
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:27,515
hand to hand combat is about
so much more than just

270
00:12:27,685 --> 00:12:30,273
administering brute force
on your opponent, right B?

271
00:12:30,443 --> 00:12:33,052
- You know it!
- It's a science.

272
00:12:34,048 --> 00:12:36,151
The sweet science, as it were.

273
00:12:36,411 --> 00:12:39,646
Wait, I'm confused,
what did those guys do to deserve it?

274
00:12:39,976 --> 00:12:42,238
Well, this may sound petty,

275
00:12:43,486 --> 00:12:45,586
- but they sat in our booth.
- They sat in our booth.

276
00:12:45,756 --> 00:12:47,418
- And nobody...
- Nobody.

277
00:12:47,588 --> 00:12:48,942
Sits in our booth.

278
00:12:53,196 --> 00:12:55,493
Are you going to beat those guys up?

279
00:12:59,688 --> 00:13:02,302
Yes, we are going to beat
those guys up. Ted, come on.

280
00:13:06,005 --> 00:13:08,255
You two.
Our booth.

281
00:13:08,425 --> 00:13:11,237
- Get out. Now!
- What are you doing?

282
00:13:11,407 --> 00:13:13,138
Relax, we got Doug.
Big Doug's got our backs.

283
00:13:13,238 --> 00:13:15,046
Yeah, Doug's not here tonight.

284
00:13:15,556 --> 00:13:16,681
Can I get you guys anything?

285
00:13:16,851 --> 00:13:18,818
Drinks? Cash?
Those two girls over there?

286
00:13:19,756 --> 00:13:21,174
Are you Ted Mosby?

287
00:13:22,606 --> 00:13:25,111
- Yeah, I am.
- And you're Barney Stinson?

288
00:13:25,281 --> 00:13:26,661
They've heard of us.

289
00:13:26,969 --> 00:13:31,259
It's cool, guys. We'll let you leave
with your asses unkicked.

290
00:13:31,559 --> 00:13:34,275
This time.
A'ight?

291
00:13:35,813 --> 00:13:38,578
- What's... what's this?
- You've been served.

292
00:13:38,748 --> 00:13:40,632
You're being sued for assault.

293
00:13:41,333 --> 00:13:42,758
Enjoy your booth.

294
00:13:48,698 --> 00:13:50,011
That was close.

295
00:13:54,537 --> 00:13:57,005
Assault!
They're suing us for assault!

296
00:13:57,126 --> 00:13:59,428
Okay, well, what's the penalty
for assault?

297
00:13:59,565 --> 00:14:01,204
What, do I have to pay a fine?

298
00:14:01,374 --> 00:14:02,717
Pick up trash on the highway?

299
00:14:02,817 --> 00:14:05,120
'Cause I've done that before,
know what I mean?

300
00:14:05,415 --> 00:14:06,433
I don't know.

301
00:14:06,533 --> 00:14:07,629
<i>Actually, he did know</i>

302
00:14:07,729 --> 00:14:10,263
<i>that the worst we were looking at
was a small civil settlement,</i>

303
00:14:10,379 --> 00:14:11,982
<i>and probably no criminal charges.</i>

304
00:14:12,152 --> 00:14:13,648
<i>But he was really pissed at us.</i>

305
00:14:13,768 --> 00:14:16,892
I mean, you guys could be looking at
some serious prison time.

306
00:14:17,113 --> 00:14:19,231
- Prison?!
- I can't go to prison!

307
00:14:19,797 --> 00:14:21,634
I mean, I could get a lot
of reading done,

308
00:14:21,734 --> 00:14:23,693
finally write some short stories.

309
00:14:23,908 --> 00:14:25,206
Work out all the time.

310
00:14:25,314 --> 00:14:27,772
Seriously, if I don't come out
of there completely ripped...

311
00:14:27,872 --> 00:14:29,810
We can't go to prison!

312
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:31,967
People get shivved in the joint!

313
00:14:32,975 --> 00:14:35,164
Plus the meals are really starchy.

314
00:14:35,732 --> 00:14:39,541
Well, you guys should have thought
of that before you beat up those guys.

315
00:14:41,605 --> 00:14:42,791
What if we didn't?

316
00:14:43,095 --> 00:14:44,978
- Didn't what, Ted?
- Didn't beat up those guys.

317
00:14:45,078 --> 00:14:47,019
What if Doug beat up those guys all
by himself

318
00:14:47,119 --> 00:14:48,907
- and we didn't do anything?
- I knew it!

319
00:14:49,007 --> 00:14:50,929
I knew it! I knew it! I knew it!

320
00:14:51,189 --> 00:14:55,873
- You guys didn't throw a single punch.
- Well, I hit Ted and myself, so...

321
00:14:55,973 --> 00:14:59,184
Well, who's the wuss now?
Answer:

322
00:14:59,354 --> 00:15:00,160
You guys.

323
00:15:00,330 --> 00:15:02,142
Look, can you just help us
get out of this?

324
00:15:02,242 --> 00:15:05,049
You know the old expression:
If you're not prepared to do the time

325
00:15:05,149 --> 00:15:07,444
don't pretend to do the crime and laugh

326
00:15:07,544 --> 00:15:11,144
and get free drinks and not stand up
for your friend who, incidentally,

327
00:15:11,269 --> 00:15:14,210
has been in plenty of fights
with his brothers.

328
00:15:16,155 --> 00:15:18,286
Look, you've got to help us out,
Marshall.

329
00:15:18,456 --> 00:15:20,616
We're the Three Musketeers!

330
00:15:21,274 --> 00:15:23,629
If I give up Ted,
how much time am I looking at?

331
00:15:29,526 --> 00:15:31,239
I've been looking for you.

332
00:15:31,830 --> 00:15:34,920
I got... tickets to this hockey game
tonight. It's stupid.

333
00:15:35,410 --> 00:15:36,432
You want to go?

334
00:15:36,602 --> 00:15:39,175
It might go kind of late, so,
maybe, after the game

335
00:15:39,275 --> 00:15:40,542
we can grab a drink.

336
00:15:40,943 --> 00:15:42,934
Get this.
You know that fight?

337
00:15:43,889 --> 00:15:45,646
These guys faked the whole thing.

338
00:15:52,949 --> 00:15:55,167
I forgot!
Tonight is no good.

339
00:15:55,337 --> 00:15:59,297
I can't go to that hockey game
tonight, I got that...

340
00:16:18,224 --> 00:16:20,352
Good news...
I talked to the guys.

341
00:16:20,522 --> 00:16:22,495
- What guys?
- The guys you didn't beat up.

342
00:16:22,665 --> 00:16:24,580
They agreed to drop the lawsuit.

343
00:16:25,004 --> 00:16:26,081
Lawyered.

344
00:16:26,181 --> 00:16:27,782
What? They agreed to drop it?

345
00:16:27,952 --> 00:16:30,669
I just explained that you two
are wusses.

346
00:16:30,938 --> 00:16:33,592
We had a good laugh about that.
A good long laugh, actually.

347
00:16:33,762 --> 00:16:36,637
I explained how you get a
mani/pedi once a month.

348
00:16:37,006 --> 00:16:39,273
Weekly, Wolverine...
some of us care.

349
00:16:39,829 --> 00:16:42,271
And how you played
the hammer dulcimer

350
00:16:42,371 --> 00:16:44,789
in the Pre-Reformation Dance
Society at Wesleyan.

351
00:16:45,125 --> 00:16:46,887
Did you at least tell them
we were one of

352
00:16:46,987 --> 00:16:49,750
the premier Medieval chamber groups
in the Little Ivies?

353
00:16:49,964 --> 00:16:50,794
I did.

354
00:16:50,894 --> 00:16:52,810
And we all agreed
it was much more likely that

355
00:16:52,910 --> 00:16:54,378
one guy beat up the three of them

356
00:16:54,478 --> 00:16:57,311
than that you two had anything
to do with it, so...

357
00:16:57,993 --> 00:16:58,981
Wait, so...

358
00:16:59,303 --> 00:17:01,655
- so now they're only suing Doug.
- Affirmative.

359
00:17:02,516 --> 00:17:04,015
Angry, irrational,

360
00:17:05,013 --> 00:17:05,978
violent Doug,

361
00:17:06,108 --> 00:17:09,175
who now knows we were the ones
who threw him under the bus.

362
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:11,221
They what?!

363
00:17:12,301 --> 00:17:15,207
- Look, Doug, we can explain...
- Explain what?

364
00:17:15,531 --> 00:17:18,446
Explain how you stabbed me
in the back right to my face?

365
00:17:18,616 --> 00:17:19,917
Robin, I'm scared.

366
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:21,811
Is Doug seeing anyone?

367
00:17:21,981 --> 00:17:24,381
Are you seeing anyone?
You really should.

368
00:17:24,791 --> 00:17:26,590
Doug, look, you don't understand,

369
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:28,915
you beat up those guys all by yourself.

370
00:17:29,085 --> 00:17:32,392
It's true, all right? They had nothing
to do with it. I mean...

371
00:17:33,112 --> 00:17:34,467
look at these two.

372
00:17:36,050 --> 00:17:37,318
It was all Ted!

373
00:17:39,521 --> 00:17:41,660
- Look at this guy.
- Yeah, look at me!

374
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,570
He wouldn't last 5 minutes in a fight.

375
00:17:43,670 --> 00:17:45,108
I think I could last at least five...

376
00:17:45,208 --> 00:17:47,794
He's got the muscle definition
of linguini.

377
00:17:48,542 --> 00:17:51,133
Linguini with meatballs maybe...
check it.

378
00:17:52,797 --> 00:17:53,987
- Look!
- Don't.

379
00:17:54,707 --> 00:17:56,557
Okay, you know what,
maybe it was

380
00:17:56,657 --> 00:17:58,947
just me. Actually, you know what,
that makes a lot of sense.

381
00:17:59,047 --> 00:18:00,415
I tend to black out a lot.

382
00:18:00,515 --> 00:18:03,106
Anyway, look,
I always got your back.

383
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:05,462
All I ask in return
is that you got mine.

384
00:18:05,632 --> 00:18:06,921
But you know what?

385
00:18:07,233 --> 00:18:08,261
You don't.

386
00:18:09,019 --> 00:18:10,579
You can't be counted on.

387
00:18:11,741 --> 00:18:13,689
No wonder your fianc?e left you.

388
00:18:14,390 --> 00:18:17,647
<i>And here it is, kids,
the only fight I've ever been in.</i>

389
00:18:17,817 --> 00:18:20,178
<i>So what can I share
about the experience?</i>

390
00:18:22,526 --> 00:18:25,479
<i>Well, for starters,
when you punch someone in the face,</i>

391
00:18:26,428 --> 00:18:27,975
<i>it hurts your hand...</i>

392
00:18:28,924 --> 00:18:29,697
<i>a lot.</i>

393
00:18:32,014 --> 00:18:34,140
<i>But what hurts even more than that?</i>

394
00:18:35,078 --> 00:18:35,872
<i>This.</i>

395
00:18:37,238 --> 00:18:39,803
And the next thing I remember
was waking up.

396
00:18:41,385 --> 00:18:43,635
I'm all warmed up.
Let's do this thing.

397
00:18:44,481 --> 00:18:47,488
<i>Turns out getting in a fight
was a terrible idea.</i>

398
00:18:47,781 --> 00:18:49,296
And that's my story.

399
00:18:49,551 --> 00:18:51,247
And what did you learn?

400
00:18:51,524 --> 00:18:55,177
Well, I learned that fighting is bad

401
00:18:55,971 --> 00:18:58,038
and you shouldn't do it ever.

402
00:18:58,638 --> 00:18:59,876
Any questions?

403
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:03,828
Where do you find these people?

404
00:19:03,998 --> 00:19:07,465
I know! Was there a big sale
at the wuss market?

405
00:19:07,635 --> 00:19:08,584
Wuss!

406
00:19:10,536 --> 00:19:13,581
<i>Of course, I didn't tell those kids
what really happened.</i>

407
00:19:14,378 --> 00:19:17,577
Okay, I'm all warmed up.
Let's do this thing.

408
00:19:19,288 --> 00:19:20,589
What happened?

409
00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:22,909
This happened.

410
00:19:26,525 --> 00:19:28,060
Holy crap!

411
00:19:28,553 --> 00:19:30,532
<i>Turns out Uncle Marshall
and his brothers</i>

412
00:19:30,634 --> 00:19:32,860
<i>did a little more than just roughhouse.</i>

413
00:19:39,334 --> 00:19:40,588
Cocoa break!

414
00:19:49,724 --> 00:19:52,040
Marshall looks good.
Has he lost weight?

415
00:19:52,210 --> 00:19:53,558
Bitch, don't even.

416
00:19:55,144 --> 00:19:56,990
<i>Kids, I'd love to leave you
with the message</i>

417
00:19:57,090 --> 00:19:59,172
<i>that fighting is bad
and you shouldn't do it,</i>

418
00:19:59,274 --> 00:20:00,759
<i>but I know that's pointless.</i>

419
00:20:00,929 --> 00:20:02,718
<i>So, I'll leave you with this:</i>

420
00:20:02,888 --> 00:20:05,051
<i>Don't ever get in a fight
with Uncle Marshall.</i>

421
00:20:05,221 --> 00:20:06,962
<i>That guy's freaking crazy.</i>

422
00:20:12,666 --> 00:20:14,590
It is so good to be home.

423
00:20:14,690 --> 00:20:17,046
Mom, Lily, fantastic job.

424
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:19,966
"Good food, good meat,
good God, let's eat." Right?

425
00:20:20,136 --> 00:20:22,426
Okay, here we go.
Goggles on.

426
00:20:27,890 --> 00:20:30,338
All right, so,
you guys pass the plates.

427
00:20:30,508 --> 00:20:32,432
Lily, you want white or dark meat?

428
00:20:32,602 --> 00:20:35,076
Dark! Honey, please be careful.
