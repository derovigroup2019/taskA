1
00:00:01,310 --> 00:00:03,410
Great. So, I'll give you a call.

2
00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:04,754
I hope you do.

3
00:00:08,186 --> 00:00:10,760
- Look at this.
- I just got that girl's number.

4
00:00:10,928 --> 00:00:12,870
Check it out. Holly.

5
00:00:13,222 --> 00:00:14,222
Nice.

6
00:00:14,347 --> 00:00:18,076
Girls whose names end
in L-Y are always dirty.

7
00:00:18,299 --> 00:00:21,253
Holly, Kelly, Carly, Lily.

8
00:00:23,623 --> 00:00:25,273
Yeah, I know it's true.

9
00:00:25,938 --> 00:00:28,871
And don't even
get me started on girls

10
00:00:28,996 --> 00:00:31,947
whose names should end in Y,
but instead end in I.

11
00:00:32,260 --> 00:00:34,530
Those girls are like
roller coasters.

12
00:00:34,655 --> 00:00:36,892
You got to wait in a long line,
but once you get up there,

13
00:00:37,017 --> 00:00:39,413
you just hold on for dear life
and hope you don't drop your keys.

14
00:00:40,401 --> 00:00:43,209
You know what I'm gonna do?
I'm gonna call her right now.

15
00:00:43,466 --> 00:00:46,754
I'm gonna do that whole,
"Remember me? It's been so long".

16
00:00:48,173 --> 00:00:50,257
See, it's funny
because I just saw her.

17
00:00:50,425 --> 00:00:51,476
You can't call her.

18
00:00:51,601 --> 00:00:54,095
You have to wait 3 days
to call a woman. That's the rule.

19
00:00:54,263 --> 00:00:56,228
Barney, that rule
is completely played out.

20
00:00:56,353 --> 00:00:58,124
Girls know exactly
what you're doing.

21
00:00:58,415 --> 00:00:59,675
I got a new rule.

22
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:02,006
It's kind of crazy, but I call it,

23
00:01:02,131 --> 00:01:04,146
you like her, you call her.

24
00:01:04,314 --> 00:01:07,817
I'm sorry. Can you repeat that?
I don't speak "I never get laid".

25
00:01:08,738 --> 00:01:11,319
Barney, the 3 days rule is insane.

26
00:01:11,444 --> 00:01:13,572
I mean, who even came up with that?

27
00:01:14,653 --> 00:01:15,700
Jesus.

28
00:01:15,969 --> 00:01:18,661
Barney, don't do this.
Not with Jesus.

29
00:01:18,967 --> 00:01:20,002
Seriously.

30
00:01:20,127 --> 00:01:23,023
Jesus started
the whole wait 3 days thing.

31
00:01:23,148 --> 00:01:26,085
He waited 3 days to come back to life.
It was perfect.

32
00:01:26,253 --> 00:01:27,779
If he have only waited one day,

33
00:01:27,904 --> 00:01:29,723
people wouldn't have
even heard that he died.

34
00:01:29,848 --> 00:01:31,966
They'd be all, "Jesus, what up?"

35
00:01:32,359 --> 00:01:36,095
And Jesus would probably be,
like, "What up? I died yesterday".

36
00:01:36,735 --> 00:01:40,182
And then they'd be all,
"You look pretty alive to me, dude".

37
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:42,689
And then he would have to explain
how he was resurrected

38
00:01:42,814 --> 00:01:44,135
and how it was a miracle.

39
00:01:44,260 --> 00:01:48,206
And then, the dude would be, like,
"Okay, whatever you say, bro".

40
00:01:48,862 --> 00:01:51,277
Ancient dialogue
sounds so stilted now.

41
00:01:51,445 --> 00:01:53,487
And he's not going
to come back on a Saturday.

42
00:01:53,741 --> 00:01:56,031
Everybody's busy doing chores.

43
00:01:56,199 --> 00:01:58,111
Working the loom,
trimming their beards.

44
00:01:58,236 --> 00:02:02,000
No. He waits the exact
right number of days...

45
00:02:02,734 --> 00:02:03,539
Three.

46
00:02:03,797 --> 00:02:06,625
OK, I promise, I'll wait three days.
Just please stop talking.

47
00:02:07,989 --> 00:02:10,171
Plus, it's Sunday,
so everyone's in church already.

48
00:02:10,999 --> 00:02:14,383
They're all in there,
"No, Jesus is dead".

49
00:02:14,551 --> 00:02:18,295
Then, bam! He bursts through
the back door, runs up the aisle.

50
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:20,523
Everyone's totally psyched.
And, FYI,

51
00:02:20,648 --> 00:02:23,098
that's when
he invented the high-five.

52
00:02:23,223 --> 00:02:26,641
Three days, Ted.
We wait three days to call a woman

53
00:02:26,892 --> 00:02:29,982
because that's how long Jesus
wants us to wait.

54
00:02:32,326 --> 00:02:33,277
True story.

55
00:02:34,821 --> 00:02:37,066
Synchro: ShalimarFox, Arrow

56
00:02:47,668 --> 00:02:49,752
Okay, fine.
I promise.

57
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:51,754
I won't call Holly for three days.

58
00:02:52,072 --> 00:02:54,622
<i>But I never said anything
about texting.</i>

59
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:57,508
<i>I started things off with something
cute and charming.</i>

60
00:02:57,633 --> 00:03:01,328
<i>"I was thinking about you, so I thought
I'd send you a little texty text."</i>

61
00:03:02,265 --> 00:03:06,215
<i>And the moment I hit "Send",
I realized it wasn't cute at all.</i>

62
00:03:06,829 --> 00:03:09,766
<i>It was the lamest thing
anyone has ever said to anyone.</i>

63
00:03:10,066 --> 00:03:12,650
<i>And the worst thing about texting
is that once you send it...</i>

64
00:03:19,609 --> 00:03:21,588
<i>... you can never get it back.</i>

65
00:03:21,713 --> 00:03:23,533
<i>And then... you wait.</i>

66
00:03:24,359 --> 00:03:27,809
<i>And just when you've decided
never to text anyone again...</i>

67
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:31,252
<i>"I've been thinking about you, too,</i>

68
00:03:31,830 --> 00:03:35,184
<i>"and how weird is it that you texted me
while I was in the bath?"</i>

69
00:03:42,307 --> 00:03:43,767
- What was that?
- What?

70
00:03:43,892 --> 00:03:46,684
- You made a noise.
- That was my phone. I got a text.

71
00:03:46,957 --> 00:03:49,353
Not that. You made
your naked lady noise.

72
00:03:49,521 --> 00:03:51,819
- What?!
- Whenever you see a naked lady,

73
00:03:51,944 --> 00:03:53,332
you make the noise.

74
00:03:56,194 --> 00:03:58,112
- I don't do that.
- Really?

75
00:04:00,991 --> 00:04:02,342
God, sorry, Lily.

76
00:04:07,601 --> 00:04:09,186
<i>While the men are out hunting, </i>

77
00:04:09,311 --> 00:04:11,564
<i>the women of New Guinea's
indigenous Korowai tribe</i>

78
00:04:11,689 --> 00:04:13,544
<i>wash their clothes in the river.</i>

79
00:04:21,050 --> 00:04:22,303
That's totally a boob.

80
00:04:24,914 --> 00:04:28,475
Is that Holly who keeps texting you?
Didn't you promise to wait three days?

81
00:04:28,643 --> 00:04:31,186
To call, yes.
Texting is totally different.

82
00:04:31,708 --> 00:04:34,732
Okay, well, just try to keep
the naked lady noises to a minimum.

83
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:36,901
I don't make a naked lady noise.

84
00:04:38,629 --> 00:04:39,629
Really?

85
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:49,610
<i>Holly and I stayed up texting
until 2:00 in the morning.</i>

86
00:04:50,707 --> 00:04:53,457
<i>And we spent the whole next day
texting each other, too.</i>

87
00:04:54,101 --> 00:04:55,549
<i>She seemed perfect.</i>

88
00:04:57,839 --> 00:05:01,425
Holly just told me what she's wearing
right now. It is pretty hot.

89
00:05:01,593 --> 00:05:04,386
Yeah, whatever it is, I can
guarantee you she's not wearing it.

90
00:05:04,554 --> 00:05:06,138
She's lying to make you like her.

91
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:07,723
How do you know that?

92
00:05:09,192 --> 00:05:11,529
Because no woman
in the history of the world is ever

93
00:05:11,654 --> 00:05:15,238
"just sitting around reading
architecture magazines in my old

94
00:05:15,363 --> 00:05:16,815
"cheerleader uniform."

95
00:05:17,499 --> 00:05:21,070
Okay, maybe she's lying
about the architecture magazines.

96
00:05:27,565 --> 00:05:29,471
- No. This is bad.
- What?

97
00:05:29,754 --> 00:05:33,165
She just sent me a text that was
clearly meant for someone else.

98
00:05:34,772 --> 00:05:38,253
"Baby, I picked up some take-out
from Generro's. Be home soon."

99
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:42,514
Okay, yes, this sounds bad,
but let's think about this, okay?

100
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:46,387
It could be for a brother
or maybe her sick dad.

101
00:05:46,555 --> 00:05:47,655
Scroll down.

102
00:05:49,235 --> 00:05:52,564
"And then I want you to
do me on the couch."

103
00:05:53,953 --> 00:05:55,647
Okay, maybe not a sick dad.

104
00:05:56,548 --> 00:05:59,480
Or a very sick dad.
Am I right?

105
00:06:01,866 --> 00:06:02,866
Sorry.

106
00:06:04,352 --> 00:06:05,445
Hey, guys.

107
00:06:07,354 --> 00:06:08,754
God. What is this?

108
00:06:10,495 --> 00:06:12,913
It's some take-out from Generro's.
I'm bringing it home for Lily.

109
00:06:13,081 --> 00:06:14,012
That's weird.

110
00:06:14,137 --> 00:06:16,875
Holly just texted Ted something
about take-out from Generro's.

111
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:20,870
Wait a second.

112
00:06:21,775 --> 00:06:23,275
You sons of bitches.

113
00:06:23,811 --> 00:06:24,821
What?

114
00:06:25,384 --> 00:06:26,581
You're Holly.

115
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:33,684
So Ted hasn't been texting
Holly at all?

116
00:06:33,852 --> 00:06:35,329
He's been texting you two?

117
00:06:35,454 --> 00:06:38,379
Look, we knew he'd try to call her
before the three days,

118
00:06:38,504 --> 00:06:42,254
so I swiped his phone, and I changed
her number to my work cell.

119
00:06:42,527 --> 00:06:46,037
We were just gonna bust on him
for calling her too soon, but then he...

120
00:06:46,591 --> 00:06:47,740
started texting her.

121
00:06:49,268 --> 00:06:51,118
"Texty text"?!

122
00:06:53,356 --> 00:06:55,258
Poor, sweet Ted.
We should...

123
00:06:55,659 --> 00:06:57,919
- we should tell him it's us.
- Yeah.

124
00:06:58,044 --> 00:06:59,044
Or...

125
00:06:59,571 --> 00:07:02,546
we pretend we're Holly,
and we're in the bath.

126
00:07:03,650 --> 00:07:05,150
Yeah, that's better.

127
00:07:11,327 --> 00:07:12,347
That was fun.

128
00:07:12,722 --> 00:07:15,225
- We should tell him that it's us.
- Yeah, we should.

129
00:07:15,567 --> 00:07:16,567
Or...

130
00:07:17,063 --> 00:07:19,282
we tell him
our favorite color is red,

131
00:07:19,407 --> 00:07:21,857
and we think the cowboy look
is very sexy.

132
00:07:22,893 --> 00:07:24,393
Yeah, that's better.

133
00:07:25,452 --> 00:07:29,448
I'm wearing them right now,
and they do look sexy.

134
00:07:31,086 --> 00:07:33,712
- He put on the boots!
- He totally put on the boots!

135
00:07:35,251 --> 00:07:36,914
That was awesome!

136
00:07:37,082 --> 00:07:40,627
But it's time to tell him
who he really put those boots on for.

137
00:07:40,752 --> 00:07:42,427
Yeah.
Or...

138
00:07:43,049 --> 00:07:44,963
we just took off our shirt.

139
00:07:46,025 --> 00:07:47,525
Yeah, that's better.

140
00:07:48,669 --> 00:07:52,537
You think maybe we're wearing
a black lace bra underneath?

141
00:07:53,842 --> 00:07:55,933
I don't think we're wearing anything
underneath.

142
00:07:56,288 --> 00:07:57,434
God, we're hot.

143
00:08:00,499 --> 00:08:03,138
Now he's only wearing
the cowboy boots!

144
00:08:03,263 --> 00:08:05,113
- It is on!
- It is so on!

145
00:08:05,415 --> 00:08:08,945
Tell him that we're...
we're slowing slipping out of our...

146
00:08:10,942 --> 00:08:12,282
What are we doing?

147
00:08:14,808 --> 00:08:16,358
I think that we're...

148
00:08:16,618 --> 00:08:18,468
about to have sex with Ted.

149
00:08:23,030 --> 00:08:25,216
So, you did this to him all day?

150
00:08:25,341 --> 00:08:26,463
That's just mean.

151
00:08:28,092 --> 00:08:30,186
No, it was...
it was actually for his own good.

152
00:08:30,311 --> 00:08:33,286
We're protecting him from himself.
He... really likes this girl.

153
00:08:33,411 --> 00:08:34,763
He had that look in his eye.

154
00:08:34,931 --> 00:08:38,468
Yeah, that crazy "I'm about to move
too fast and screw this up" look.

155
00:08:39,227 --> 00:08:41,311
The same look he had
on his first date with you.

156
00:08:41,666 --> 00:08:43,522
We all remember how that went.

157
00:08:44,432 --> 00:08:46,617
- I think I'm in love with you.
- What?

158
00:08:47,468 --> 00:08:50,242
Yeah, well,
I think I was a special case.

159
00:08:50,367 --> 00:08:53,073
This Holly is no Robin Scherbatsky.

160
00:08:53,889 --> 00:08:55,789
What is the deal with her hair?

161
00:08:55,914 --> 00:08:57,082
I mean, news flash:

162
00:08:57,207 --> 00:08:59,711
they make conditioners
that don't leave a buildup.

163
00:09:00,078 --> 00:09:01,128
I'm so bad.

164
00:09:01,989 --> 00:09:04,681
Look, it's been a while
since Ted really liked someone.

165
00:09:04,806 --> 00:09:07,172
He's clearly got a lot of crazy
stored up. We just...

166
00:09:07,297 --> 00:09:09,099
we thought we'd get him
to say "I love you"

167
00:09:09,224 --> 00:09:11,085
before he makes contact
with this girl.

168
00:09:11,210 --> 00:09:14,136
And you can tell it's on the way.
He's exhibiting all the telltale signs.

169
00:09:14,409 --> 00:09:16,889
Yeah. One:
He joked about getting married.

170
00:09:17,426 --> 00:09:20,055
<i>"You like architecture?
We should get married.</i>

171
00:09:20,306 --> 00:09:24,134
<i>"Ha-ha. LOL. Just kidding.
Question mark?"</i>

172
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:28,525
Two: He made a crazy way
too soon trip suggestion.

173
00:09:29,018 --> 00:09:30,320
<i>"I like beer, too.</i>

174
00:09:30,445 --> 00:09:32,606
<i>"We should totally go
to Germany together.</i>

175
00:09:32,731 --> 00:09:35,464
<i>"LOL. JK. LOL."</i>

176
00:09:36,993 --> 00:09:40,537
And three:
He got way too personal way too soon.

177
00:09:40,897 --> 00:09:43,864
<i>"Yeah, my parents got divorced
a couple years back.</i>

178
00:09:43,989 --> 00:09:45,539
<i>"It was really tough.</i>

179
00:09:45,797 --> 00:09:47,074
"<i>LOL."</i>

180
00:09:48,229 --> 00:09:50,589
And he clearly doesn't know
what LOL means.

181
00:09:50,757 --> 00:09:53,565
Yeah, but here's the real problem.
Ted wasn't saying "I love you"

182
00:09:53,690 --> 00:09:55,427
as easily as we thought he would.

183
00:09:55,668 --> 00:09:57,462
Then we met... Stan.

184
00:10:04,722 --> 00:10:06,919
Why are you making
so much noise, man?

185
00:10:08,321 --> 00:10:11,147
So we explained everything to him,
and when we were done,

186
00:10:11,847 --> 00:10:13,278
something amazing happened.

187
00:10:14,026 --> 00:10:16,240
Why don't you tell Ted
that just knowing he's out there,

188
00:10:16,408 --> 00:10:18,464
thinking about you,
caring about you,

189
00:10:18,589 --> 00:10:19,910
makes you feel safe?

190
00:10:20,995 --> 00:10:23,826
So, all your fears,
all your yesterdays wash away,

191
00:10:23,951 --> 00:10:27,376
and only hope remains
in the promise of his embrace.

192
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:31,606
Go, Stan.

193
00:10:31,967 --> 00:10:34,341
- Who is this guy?
- A security guard who works nights.

194
00:10:34,510 --> 00:10:37,094
- He eats lunch at MacLaren's every day.
- And he wasn't done.

195
00:10:37,263 --> 00:10:38,470
Not by a long shot.

196
00:10:39,071 --> 00:10:41,720
You make me thank God
for every mistake I ever made

197
00:10:41,845 --> 00:10:45,143
because each one led me down
the path that brought me to you.

198
00:10:46,534 --> 00:10:48,480
That's... really nice, man.

199
00:10:49,148 --> 00:10:50,399
Whatever. It's okay.

200
00:10:52,377 --> 00:10:54,035
<i>"And when we finally come together,</i>

201
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:55,810
<i>"I want you to hold me.</i>

202
00:10:56,124 --> 00:10:57,848
Hold me all night.

203
00:10:57,973 --> 00:10:59,349
Stroke my hair.

204
00:10:59,474 --> 00:11:02,476
Tell me I'm a woman
and show me you're a man.

205
00:11:02,601 --> 00:11:04,599
Until there there was only now.

206
00:11:04,724 --> 00:11:06,538
You and I...

207
00:11:07,351 --> 00:11:08,651
and now.

208
00:11:11,978 --> 00:11:14,078
You want me to text that to Ted.

209
00:11:14,541 --> 00:11:15,641
I know that.

210
00:11:17,542 --> 00:11:19,979
<i>"I do not ask
of the night explanations.</i>

211
00:11:20,104 --> 00:11:22,755
<i>"I wait for it, and it envelops me,</i>

212
00:11:22,979 --> 00:11:25,416
<i>"and so you and bread</i>

213
00:11:25,792 --> 00:11:28,664
<i>"and light and shadow are."</i>

214
00:11:29,564 --> 00:11:31,230
That's Pablo Neruda.

215
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:32,990
I don't know...

216
00:11:33,376 --> 00:11:37,233
what bread was doing in there,
but that touched me here

217
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:39,948
and here.

218
00:11:40,506 --> 00:11:42,948
Well, if Ted won't say it, I will.

219
00:11:44,212 --> 00:11:45,347
I love you.

220
00:11:47,925 --> 00:11:48,999
That's cool.

221
00:11:51,362 --> 00:11:52,502
Still nothing, huh?

222
00:11:52,736 --> 00:11:54,171
Maybe he's not in love with us.

223
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:57,007
How can he not be in love with us?
We're everything he's looking for.

224
00:11:57,176 --> 00:11:58,447
I don't get men.

225
00:12:00,178 --> 00:12:01,302
Got to head to work.

226
00:12:01,427 --> 00:12:03,461
Will you be...
Will you be back?

227
00:12:04,053 --> 00:12:07,685
I'll be back when the wind
and fates and chance bring me back.

228
00:12:08,117 --> 00:12:09,767
Which will be tomorrow.

229
00:12:10,053 --> 00:12:11,396
It's cheese steak day.

230
00:12:15,115 --> 00:12:17,110
It sounds like
you were all over this guy.

231
00:12:17,556 --> 00:12:19,806
Hope his girlfriend
didn't get jealous.

232
00:12:19,931 --> 00:12:21,990
Did he mention a girlfriend or...?

233
00:12:23,391 --> 00:12:24,624
It was all going great

234
00:12:24,749 --> 00:12:27,246
until Marshall sent Ted
a text meant for Lily

235
00:12:27,371 --> 00:12:29,456
- and ruined everything.
- It doesn't matter.

236
00:12:29,625 --> 00:12:30,933
Okay? It's over now.

237
00:12:31,058 --> 00:12:33,150
I got to get going,
but here's what's gonna happen:

238
00:12:33,275 --> 00:12:35,122
You're going to call him right now,

239
00:12:35,247 --> 00:12:37,558
tell him what you did,
and apologize.

240
00:12:37,683 --> 00:12:38,674
You got it?

241
00:12:43,061 --> 00:12:44,061
Or...

242
00:12:45,124 --> 00:12:47,938
Holly explained everything.
It was all just a misunderstanding.

243
00:12:48,063 --> 00:12:49,226
Everything's great now.

244
00:12:49,395 --> 00:12:50,373
Really?

245
00:12:50,498 --> 00:12:53,105
How did Holly explain
her way out of that one?

246
00:12:53,273 --> 00:12:54,252
Apparently,

247
00:12:54,377 --> 00:12:57,030
her dumb friend Marsha
accidentally used her phone

248
00:12:57,155 --> 00:12:59,948
- to text her husband Billy.
- Marsha and Billy.

249
00:13:00,315 --> 00:13:01,946
No one sprained any muscles there.

250
00:13:03,463 --> 00:13:05,369
And now we are better than ever.

251
00:13:05,942 --> 00:13:07,617
Look, I know this sounds crazy,

252
00:13:08,199 --> 00:13:10,288
but I think I might actually
be falling for this girl.

253
00:13:11,378 --> 00:13:13,083
You're falling
for Barney and Marshall.

254
00:13:13,814 --> 00:13:15,505
- What?
- They didn't believe

255
00:13:15,630 --> 00:13:17,069
that you could wait the 3 days,

256
00:13:17,194 --> 00:13:20,483
so Barney changed her number
in your phone to his work cell.

257
00:13:20,756 --> 00:13:22,592
Holly is Barney and Marshall.

258
00:13:22,821 --> 00:13:24,927
Wait. That whole time it was them?

259
00:13:26,265 --> 00:13:27,889
So Holly wasn't in the bath?

260
00:13:31,196 --> 00:13:34,729
Or sitting by her window, looking up
at the stars, thinking about me?

261
00:13:38,699 --> 00:13:41,142
Or lounging
in her old cheerleader uniform

262
00:13:41,267 --> 00:13:42,779
reading architecture magazines?

263
00:13:46,409 --> 00:13:49,075
Yeah. I don't think
they actually did those things.

264
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,454
They were just at the bar.

265
00:13:51,264 --> 00:13:52,264
Right.

266
00:13:52,389 --> 00:13:53,498
But, it was them.

267
00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:56,877
- Unbelievable.
- I know.

268
00:13:57,264 --> 00:13:59,212
So you might as well tell them
you're on to them.

269
00:14:01,079 --> 00:14:01,840
Or...

270
00:14:03,079 --> 00:14:05,759
I text them something
that will really mess with their heads.

271
00:14:06,015 --> 00:14:07,471
Oh, I gotcha.

272
00:14:08,935 --> 00:14:09,806
How about...

273
00:14:10,453 --> 00:14:12,767
"I haven't told any
of my friends yet,

274
00:14:12,892 --> 00:14:15,187
but I only have three months
to live"?

275
00:14:15,355 --> 00:14:16,302
Not bad.

276
00:14:16,427 --> 00:14:19,147
How about "I once killed a man
with a shovel,

277
00:14:19,272 --> 00:14:21,109
and those feelings
are creeping up again"?

278
00:14:22,491 --> 00:14:24,483
I liked that thing
someone said before

279
00:14:24,615 --> 00:14:26,178
about having three months to live.

280
00:14:26,367 --> 00:14:28,552
How about "I never told anyone this,

281
00:14:28,677 --> 00:14:30,827
but I slept
with my best friend's mom"?

282
00:14:30,996 --> 00:14:33,711
That is good, but I feel
like we keep coming back

283
00:14:33,836 --> 00:14:35,498
to that three months to live thing.

284
00:14:35,930 --> 00:14:37,584
Wait.
I think I got it.

285
00:14:41,256 --> 00:14:42,506
He texted back!

286
00:14:43,496 --> 00:14:45,901
"I probably shouldn't tell you this.

287
00:14:46,308 --> 00:14:49,204
"I mean we barely know each other.

288
00:14:49,597 --> 00:14:51,556
"But what the hell,
I'll just say it."

289
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:53,941
This is it, dude.
Here comes the "I love you."

290
00:14:54,383 --> 00:14:56,561
- I wish Stan were here.
- Stan.

291
00:15:00,483 --> 00:15:01,483
What?

292
00:15:02,188 --> 00:15:05,766
"I sometimes have gay dreams
about my best friend."

293
00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:14,829
"I sometimes have gay dreams
about my best friend."

294
00:15:15,127 --> 00:15:18,662
Why in the world would Ted text
a girl he barely knows

295
00:15:18,787 --> 00:15:21,002
that he sometimes has gay dreams
about me?

296
00:15:21,990 --> 00:15:23,254
Slow your roll.

297
00:15:23,379 --> 00:15:24,184
You?

298
00:15:24,565 --> 00:15:26,049
He's clearly talking about me.

299
00:15:26,442 --> 00:15:28,677
Dude, it's me.
I'm his best friend.

300
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:30,546
Okay, one:
that has never been proven.

301
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:32,696
Two:
If anyone were to have gay dreams

302
00:15:32,821 --> 00:15:34,720
about one of us, it would be me.

303
00:15:35,619 --> 00:15:38,103
I mean, look at me.
Now look at you.

304
00:15:38,426 --> 00:15:42,273
A still-in-the-closet 80-year-old
wouldn't be into that mess.

305
00:15:43,134 --> 00:15:46,111
Here's the thing, Barney.
I'm snuggly. You're not.

306
00:15:46,674 --> 00:15:48,344
Who wouldn't want to snuggle up next

307
00:15:48,469 --> 00:15:50,344
to this business
on a Sunday morning?

308
00:15:50,469 --> 00:15:52,885
Wrapped in a comforter,
and it's raining outside,

309
00:15:53,010 --> 00:15:55,935
and there's muffins warming in the oven.
I'm cuddly, bitch.

310
00:15:56,060 --> 00:15:57,426
Deal with it.

311
00:15:57,551 --> 00:15:59,416
I work out every day.

312
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:01,887
If there is one thing
we know about Ted,

313
00:16:02,012 --> 00:16:04,921
it's that he likes a nice body.
This body would rock his world.

314
00:16:05,239 --> 00:16:07,888
Ted and I have a history.
I know what he likes.

315
00:16:08,013 --> 00:16:11,176
There are things I could do to him
that would blow his mind...

316
00:16:14,491 --> 00:16:17,225
- Why do we want to have sex with Ted?
- I don't know. It's weird.

317
00:16:18,704 --> 00:16:19,644
Crazy, right?

318
00:16:20,015 --> 00:16:22,248
Ted's having gay dreams about me.

319
00:16:22,566 --> 00:16:26,500
And by me, he means M-E,
Marshall Eriksen,

320
00:16:26,625 --> 00:16:29,070
star of Ted's gay dreams.

321
00:16:29,238 --> 00:16:30,061
Who cares?

322
00:16:30,186 --> 00:16:32,644
So Ted has gay dreams
about one of you guys.

323
00:16:32,769 --> 00:16:35,733
It's not like you found out
he has three months to live.

324
00:16:36,190 --> 00:16:39,223
That's like... shocking, right?

325
00:16:40,333 --> 00:16:41,540
Look at this guy.

326
00:16:41,710 --> 00:16:44,168
How's it going best friend
of 12 years?

327
00:16:45,464 --> 00:16:48,036
Well, it's kind of weird, but...

328
00:16:48,722 --> 00:16:51,968
I had this crazy dream the other night.
It's a little embarrassing.

329
00:16:52,276 --> 00:16:54,888
You can tell us, Ted.
This is a safe space.

330
00:16:55,057 --> 00:16:57,533
Yeah, your feelings are
perfectly natural, buddy.

331
00:16:58,810 --> 00:17:00,231
Here's what happened.

332
00:17:01,813 --> 00:17:03,772
<i>And then I proceed
to waste a half hour</i>

333
00:17:03,941 --> 00:17:06,107
<i>of those bastards' lives,
telling them about this dream</i>

334
00:17:06,275 --> 00:17:09,819
<i>I had where I ate dinner with my top 5
favorite architects throughout history.</i>

335
00:17:10,716 --> 00:17:12,403
And then, at the end of the meal,

336
00:17:12,528 --> 00:17:15,715
Frank Gehry slides the check
over to I.M. Pei, and he says,

337
00:17:15,967 --> 00:17:19,654
"Buddy, tonight,
your name is I.M. Paying."

338
00:17:21,165 --> 00:17:23,992
Buckminster Fuller
almost did a spit take.

339
00:17:25,655 --> 00:17:27,087
And then I woke up.

340
00:17:28,781 --> 00:17:30,048
So, that's it?

341
00:17:30,532 --> 00:17:32,487
No other dreams?

342
00:17:32,846 --> 00:17:35,887
Nothing confusing or erotic?

343
00:17:38,475 --> 00:17:41,557
Okay, how about this? You know
how at some point in the future,

344
00:17:41,682 --> 00:17:44,035
- machines will rise up against us?
- Sure.

345
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:46,564
So, the machines...
they've killed everybody,

346
00:17:47,350 --> 00:17:48,475
and all that's left

347
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:49,650
is you,

348
00:17:50,825 --> 00:17:51,603
me,

349
00:17:52,789 --> 00:17:53,839
and Barney.

350
00:17:54,663 --> 00:17:56,924
Which one of us would you, like...

351
00:17:59,101 --> 00:18:00,201
get with?

352
00:18:02,665 --> 00:18:03,677
And...

353
00:18:03,982 --> 00:18:06,042
why do I have
to get with one of you?

354
00:18:06,670 --> 00:18:08,041
The machines are forcing you.

355
00:18:08,166 --> 00:18:10,588
They want to watch.
That's just how they get down.

356
00:18:13,205 --> 00:18:16,458
That's a tough one.
I guess it would have to be...

357
00:18:19,544 --> 00:18:20,348
Holly.

358
00:18:21,816 --> 00:18:23,234
Robin told me what you guys did.

359
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:26,683
That's why I made up the gay
dreams thing. Guys, this is Holly.

360
00:18:27,917 --> 00:18:30,360
And I didn't wait your precious
three days to call her.

361
00:18:30,485 --> 00:18:32,402
I knew where she worked,
so I tracked her down.

362
00:18:33,124 --> 00:18:35,047
Let me ask you.
Did I call you too soon?

363
00:18:35,172 --> 00:18:37,487
I loved that he called me
right away.

364
00:18:37,612 --> 00:18:38,908
I found it very romantic.

365
00:18:39,828 --> 00:18:41,539
And I don't sit around my apartment

366
00:18:41,664 --> 00:18:44,246
reading architecture magazines
in my old cheerleader uniform.

367
00:18:45,584 --> 00:18:47,636
I do that completely naked.

368
00:18:52,129 --> 00:18:54,476
So Holly and I
are going out to dinner.

369
00:18:54,601 --> 00:18:55,925
I'll meet you out front.

370
00:18:58,471 --> 00:19:01,097
I'm sorry, buddy.
We were just trying to help you.

371
00:19:01,305 --> 00:19:04,026
And, also, it was really fun.

372
00:19:06,242 --> 00:19:09,063
I don't need your help, okay?
I can take care of myself.

373
00:19:09,994 --> 00:19:12,323
And, yeah, maybe...
maybe there are some girls

374
00:19:12,448 --> 00:19:14,410
who wouldn't like it
that I called them right away

375
00:19:14,535 --> 00:19:16,750
or said things too soon,
but guess what?

376
00:19:16,875 --> 00:19:18,698
Those aren't the right girls for me.

377
00:19:19,307 --> 00:19:21,126
Maybe the right girl is the one

378
00:19:21,251 --> 00:19:23,538
who loves that I do those things
because...

379
00:19:23,939 --> 00:19:26,059
that's just who I am,
and I'm not gonna change

380
00:19:26,184 --> 00:19:28,166
because of some stupid
Three Days Rule.

381
00:19:32,339 --> 00:19:34,350
Holly spells her name with an "I".

382
00:19:36,286 --> 00:19:38,936
<i>So I had proven
that the Three Days Rule was wrong,</i>

383
00:19:39,061 --> 00:19:41,187
<i>and I was out to dinner
with a pretty girl.</i>

384
00:19:41,312 --> 00:19:43,223
<i>And until right now,
I've never told anyone</i>

385
00:19:43,391 --> 00:19:45,502
<i>the truth about what happened
on that date.</i>

386
00:19:45,627 --> 00:19:48,251
That's so funny!
I love indie music, too.

387
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:50,021
We should get married.

388
00:19:50,691 --> 00:19:52,108
Just kidding.

389
00:19:52,483 --> 00:19:53,274
Or am I?

390
00:19:54,476 --> 00:19:55,527
Just kidding again.

391
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:58,071
That's it. We're totally going
to Brazil together!

392
00:19:58,442 --> 00:20:01,031
And I went to my doctor this morning,
and he said it is all cleared up,

393
00:20:01,156 --> 00:20:02,367
so I'm good to go.

394
00:20:02,935 --> 00:20:04,327
I think I'm in love with you.

395
00:20:04,945 --> 00:20:07,419
<i>In the end, I didn't need
to wait three days,</i>

396
00:20:07,748 --> 00:20:09,747
<i>but Holly really, really did.</i>

397
00:20:10,382 --> 00:20:12,708
<i>Like a lot of rules,
there are times to follow them</i>

398
00:20:12,833 --> 00:20:14,084
<i>and times to not.</i>

399
00:20:14,384 --> 00:20:15,672
<i>But I will tell you this.</i>

400
00:20:16,321 --> 00:20:18,258
<i>When I got your mother's number,</i>

401
00:20:18,383 --> 00:20:20,083
<i>I called her right away.</i>

402
00:20:24,697 --> 00:20:25,797
Hey, fellas.

403
00:20:26,183 --> 00:20:28,135
- Aren't you working?
- Took the night off.

404
00:20:28,311 --> 00:20:31,729
- That's great! We can all hang out!
- Yeah. I can't. Got a date.

405
00:20:32,574 --> 00:20:33,835
You ready, baby?

406
00:20:34,408 --> 00:20:35,508
What the...?

407
00:20:35,638 --> 00:20:39,404
Wait, wait. Couldn't you guys
just stay here and do your date with us?

408
00:20:39,573 --> 00:20:41,406
Yeah, it'll be fun!

409
00:20:41,575 --> 00:20:44,621
Look, I'm laughing!
It's fun here! You like magic?

410
00:20:45,077 --> 00:20:48,121
Fellas, it's time we said good-bye.

411
00:20:48,515 --> 00:20:50,612
I mean, we shared a very special
afternoon together,

412
00:20:50,737 --> 00:20:52,792
and that's something
I will always cherish.

413
00:20:53,203 --> 00:20:55,018
I'll never forget you guys.

414
00:20:56,214 --> 00:20:58,464
- Do you know their names?
- No idea. Is the tall one Ted?

415
00:20:58,645 --> 00:21:00,582
No. That's Marshall.
He's married to Lily.

416
00:21:00,707 --> 00:21:02,609
Okay. You like chicken wings?
