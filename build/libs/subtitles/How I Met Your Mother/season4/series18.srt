1
00:00:02,090 --> 00:00:03,070
I've been hired to design

2
00:00:03,070 --> 00:00:05,650
a new headquarters for Goliath National Bank.

3
00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:08,010
And I was eager to add as much of my voices

4
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:10,050
as an architect into the plan as possible.

5
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:14,140
woodbeams bathed in natural light in the atrium.

6
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:17,280
They're gonna to love it!

7
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:18,860
There was only one problem

8
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:21,250
and his name was Bilson

9
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:23,530
wood natural light

10
00:00:23,530 --> 00:00:25,510
Ah,no!

11
00:00:25,510 --> 00:00:29,110
Natural light reminds the workers that there's an outside world

12
00:00:29,110 --> 00:00:31,290
where they had family and friends

13
00:00:31,290 --> 00:00:33,100
We want to crush that!

14
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:36,200
You show up in the dark, you go home in the dark

15
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:40,170
You spend your whole damn day in the dark!

16
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:42,880
I need to hear Lily's voice

17
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:44,200
Who said you could leave

18
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:48,480
Bilson was killing every original idea I had

19
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:49,260
Then, one day

20
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:51,070
GNB took him off the project

21
00:00:51,070 --> 00:00:54,220
and created a new task force to oversee my designs

22
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:55,960
suddenly, everything changed

23
00:00:56,110 --> 00:00:57,160
We'll have a roof top in the end of the garden

24
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:59,060
for quiet contemplation

25
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:00,570
We'll have a reflecting pool in the lobby

26
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:04,190
where local children can come to make wishes.

27
00:01:04,190 --> 00:01:05,370
The New GNB,

28
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:07,800
A place of work

29
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:10,690
that you can call "home".

30
00:01:10,690 --> 00:01:15,520
Thank you, and welcome home.

31
00:01:21,130 --> 00:01:22,540
Everything was going great,

32
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:24,780
until one day, in the elevator

33
00:01:31,490 --> 00:01:32,780
yeah, it's ted

34
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:34,450
no, no, no, no, no, no

35
00:01:34,450 --> 00:01:35,710
I did not approved that change

36
00:01:35,710 --> 00:01:38,490
for the blueprints for the new GNB headquarters

37
00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:39,810
which I'm the head architect,

38
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:45,400
yes, I'm single, I'm not gifted charity.

39
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:47,010
what is that has to do with anything

40
00:01:47,630 --> 00:01:50,180
Alright, goodbye, Mr. Mayor.

41
00:01:51,790 --> 00:01:53,810
You know that was a fake phone call, don't you

42
00:01:53,810 --> 00:01:56,000
Yes, and I also know

43
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,400
that the new GNB headquarters project was scrapped last month

44
00:01:59,770 --> 00:02:01,300
Nice try.

45
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:18,920
Check out Scarlett Johansson at the Oscars.

46
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:20,570
If I could nail any celebrity

47
00:02:20,570 --> 00:02:22,240
it would definitely be Scarlett Johansson

48
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:23,760
Hot, talented,

49
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,830
and nobody does that many in Woody Allen's movies

50
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:27,430
without serious daddy's issues

51
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:29,940
If I could nail any celebrities, it would be Lily.

52
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:31,810
She's the star of my heart.

53
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,580
For me, it would be Hugh Jackman.

54
00:02:35,650 --> 00:02:37,700
You know, I don't know, celebrities,

55
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:41,080
they're into some really weird sex stuff. Trust me.

56
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:42,380
How would you know that

57
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:46,320
This is embarrassing,but I...

58
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:48,620
I went home with a celebrity one night.

59
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:51,240
Oh my god! Seriously?

60
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:54,320
Yeah, he wanted to do this really freaky thing with me,

61
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:55,910
So I left. That's it.

62
00:02:55,910 --> 00:02:56,970
End of the story.

63
00:02:56,970 --> 00:02:59,110
No, no, not end of the story

64
00:02:59,110 --> 00:03:03,100
I need to know who, when, and in where. Spill it!

65
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:04,080
Lily, be calm, please settle down.

66
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,480
you're swallowing too much air.

67
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:07,400
But before you go any further,

68
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:10,560
I'm flattered, but technically, I'm not a celebrity.

69
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:14,900
Plus, for the last time, I put the mask on as a joke.

70
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:16,410
OK, not you Barney.

71
00:03:16,410 --> 00:03:17,970
OK, who is it

72
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:21,750
OK, now you give Lily the hiccups.

73
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:23,970
Ok, I won't tell you anything specific.

74
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:25,880
But all I'll say

75
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:27,340
is that he is Canadian born,

76
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:28,480
but you definitely know this guy.

77
00:03:28,510 --> 00:03:30,480
And he got me back to his place

78
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:33,370
by offering to show me a very unique collection.

79
00:03:33,370 --> 00:03:34,680
""
What do you mean collection

80
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:36,260
Well, you know some people collects

81
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:38,260
like stamps or coins, it's like that.

82
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:39,030
But I'm not telling.

83
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:42,170
Well, at least tell us the weird thing he wanted to do.

84
00:03:42,170 --> 00:03:43,720
I don't know what you call it in the States,

85
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:45,270
but we have a name for it in Canada.

86
00:03:45,270 --> 00:03:47,500
Look, I've already said too much.

87
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:51,380
So, mystery celebrity who collects a mystery item

88
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:55,290
asked you to do a mystery Canadian sex act.

89
00:03:55,290 --> 00:03:56,040
Yes.

90
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:57,260
Tell us.

91
00:03:57,630 --> 00:03:58,950
OK, I'll tell you.

92
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:03,250
But only if you guess all three parts correctly.

93
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:05,930
-Well, that's just impossible.  -Exactly.

94
00:04:05,930 --> 00:04:08,420
I don't even know any Canadian sex acts.

95
00:04:08,420 --> 00:04:09,800
Well, you got your Sloppy Dog Sled,

96
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:12,900
your Newfoundland Lobster Trap, your Full Mountie.

97
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:14,030
How do you know all these

98
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:17,030
Canadiansexacts.org, it's bookmarked on the top right.

99
00:04:17,030 --> 00:04:18,740
-  -
-Dot org  -Yeah.

100
00:04:18,740 --> 00:04:19,630
It's not for profit.

101
00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:22,030
They really wanna just get the information out there.

102
00:04:22,030 --> 00:04:25,800
Hey, so I just had the weirdest conversation.

103
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,280
This woman at GNB told me

104
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:29,780
that the new bank building was scrapped last month.

105
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:30,940
It's crazy, right

106
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:33,700
Wait, what's that look

107
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:34,860
-Should we tell him  -I don't wanna tell him.

108
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:36,260
-I think we should tell him. -We're not telling him.

109
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:37,000
There was no look.

110
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,740
Guys, what the hell

111
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:41,500
Ok, it's that you know the truth.

112
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:44,880
A few weeks ago, Bilson called us into his office.

113
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:48,000
We're scrapping the plan for the new GNB headquarters.

114
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,570
This recession is killing us.

115
00:04:50,570 --> 00:04:52,510
We're cutting anything non-essential.

116
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:54,900
And I have a lot of tough choices to make

117
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:57,900
to buy courtly retreat in Saint Croix.

118
00:04:58,770 --> 00:05:00,660
Man, Ted is gonna be devastated.

119
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:02,920
Not when he hears it coming from his best friend.

120
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:04,440
-I have to tell him  -I have to tell him

121
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:07,050
You should tell him, you're his best friend.

122
00:05:07,050 --> 00:05:08,340
I'm not, you're his best friend.

123
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:09,540
I'm not, you're his best friend.

124
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:11,350
Quiet, here he comes.

125
00:05:11,350 --> 00:05:13,390
The white dude or the Asian fellow

126
00:05:13,390 --> 00:05:14,830
See I bearly know the guy.

127
00:05:15,670 --> 00:05:17,800
-Hey, Ted, what's up  -Hey, how're you doing

128
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:19,330
I'm frustrated.

129
00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:21,490
Anything innovative I put on my designs

130
00:05:21,490 --> 00:05:23,790
Bilson just hacks out with a machete

131
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:25,900
I hate having to answer to a guy like that.

132
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:27,360
You should drop the project.

133
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,970
You should totally drop the project.

134
00:05:28,970 --> 00:05:29,860
It's beneath you.

135
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:32,960
Then it's settled. To Ted Mosby's new chapter...

136
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:36,500
Are you kidding. They just laid off another architect at my firm.

137
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:38,840
I mean Bilson is a pain sure.

138
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:41,220
But without this project, I'm probably out of job.

139
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:44,770
Right, it's funny that you metioned the project.

140
00:05:44,770 --> 00:05:46,250
-Because...  -You're nailing it.

141
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:47,620
Keep up the good work buddy.

142
00:05:47,830 --> 00:05:49,960
Your hair and teeth look fantastic today.

143
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,260
You're shining like a diamond!

144
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:55,030
Thank you.

145
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:56,830
I needed that.

146
00:05:56,860 --> 00:05:58,900
All right, I'm going to head upstairs and keep working.

147
00:05:58,930 --> 00:06:00,700
I got to find a way to introduce some wood

148
00:06:00,730 --> 00:06:02,000
into Bilson's dark atrium.

149
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:05,200
I think you know what I meant.

150
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:09,460
-What was that -What

151
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:10,860
I have a thought.

152
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:12,700
Okay, we're paying Ted's firm

153
00:06:12,730 --> 00:06:14,500
for two more months of design work no matter what,

154
00:06:14,530 --> 00:06:15,800
so couldn't we just let him

155
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:17,960
keep working and not tell him

156
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,500
He's had a rough year.

157
00:06:19,530 --> 00:06:21,330
Let's let the guy be happy a little while longer.

158
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:24,030
Marshall, what you're suggesting

159
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:26,430
is an elaborate,long-term lie

160
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:28,130
that requires tremendous commitment.

161
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:30,330
A nice guy like you can't pull that off.

162
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:32,330
Sure I can.

163
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:33,660
Lie to me right now.

164
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:35,300
Okay.

165
00:06:35,330 --> 00:06:36,500
I have a spaceship.

166
00:06:36,530 --> 00:06:37,930
What kind of fuel powers your spaceship

167
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:39,030
Okay, I don't have a spaceship.

168
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:40,660
No!

169
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:42,000
Stand your ground!

170
00:06:42,030 --> 00:06:43,560
If someone questions you,

171
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:46,200
distract them from the original lie with more lies.

172
00:06:46,230 --> 00:06:47,200
Here, let me demonstrate.

173
00:06:47,230 --> 00:06:48,330
I own a pony.

174
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:50,060
Ask me a question.

175
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:51,830
Okay.

176
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:54,930
Um, what color is your pony

177
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:56,100
Well, when I first got Dandelion,

178
00:06:56,130 --> 00:06:58,100
she was a deep, chestnut brown,

179
00:06:58,130 --> 00:07:01,230
but, sadly, her stable is located near a chemical plant,

180
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:02,930
which contaminated the drinking water.

181
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:06,400
So over time, she's turned a sickly, grayish-white color

182
00:07:06,430 --> 00:07:09,530
and there's nothing that the vet can do to fix her.

183
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:11,030
My God!

184
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:12,800
I'm-- That's horrible.

185
00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:14,030
Is Dandelion going to be okay

186
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:16,400
Okay.

187
00:07:16,430 --> 00:07:17,400
All right. Huh

188
00:07:17,430 --> 00:07:18,730
You are good!

189
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:21,360
Dandelion's not even sick, is she

190
00:07:22,730 --> 00:07:25,130
So the building's really dead

191
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:26,700
and you guys lied to me

192
00:07:26,730 --> 00:07:29,760
We, we just did it to protect you, Ted.

193
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:32,600
I can't believe this.I just got screwed by my two best friends

194
00:07:32,630 --> 00:07:34,000
and I didn't even know it.

195
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:39,060
In Canada, that's called a "Sneaky Snowplow."

196
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:46,900
That building was my dream job, and now, it's just gone.

197
00:07:46,930 --> 00:07:48,160
We're so sorry, Ted.

198
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:49,900
Yeah, I need a drink.

199
00:07:50,630 --> 00:07:51,660
Poor Ted.

200
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:53,900
Would I seem heartless

201
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:56,200
if I switched us back to Canadian Sex Acts

202
00:07:56,230 --> 00:07:57,160
-Not at all.-I'm surprised you waited this long.

203
00:07:57,200 --> 00:08:00,060
What the hell is a "Two-Hand Zamboni"

204
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:01,600
Let's just say, the only thing

205
00:08:01,630 --> 00:08:04,800
the woman is wearing is skates on her hands.

206
00:08:04,830 --> 00:08:07,830
A "Manitoba Milk Bag"

207
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:09,460
Okay, it's like a "Chicago Mustache,"

208
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:10,860
but the person on the bottom

209
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:12,130
is wearing a snowsuit.

210
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:14,930
A "Newfoundland Lobster Trap"

211
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:16,600
Don't know. Don't want to know.

212
00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:18,630
Those Newfies are out of control.

213
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:21,030
Okay! Okay, I'm going to make my first guess.

214
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:22,500
Okay, but I'll only tell you if you

215
00:08:22,530 --> 00:08:26,360
correctly guess the person, the act and the collection.

216
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:27,460
Okay, I'm going to go.

217
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:29,330
Bryan Adams.

218
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:31,300
He collects baseball cards,

219
00:08:31,330 --> 00:08:35,960
and he wanted to do a "Greasy Kayak."

220
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,400
No.

221
00:08:37,430 --> 00:08:40,460
Wayne Gretzky, vintage Hot Wheels,

222
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:42,300
a "Squatting Eskimo."

223
00:08:42,330 --> 00:08:43,400
Nah-uh.

224
00:08:43,430 --> 00:08:46,730
Kiefer Sutherland, souvenir shot glasses,

225
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:49,300
and a "Sticky Flapjack."

226
00:08:49,330 --> 00:08:50,660
No.

227
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:52,560
That I would have done.

228
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:53,630
Wait.

229
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:56,330
Wait, if they pulled the plug on the project a month ago,

230
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:58,200
why have I been going in once a week

231
00:08:58,230 --> 00:09:00,800
to meet with the New Headquarters Task Force

232
00:09:00,830 --> 00:09:02,760
Well, obviously you couldn't come in

233
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:03,930
and pitch to Bilson.

234
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:07,030
So, we...invented the task force.

235
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:10,330
Then it was just a question of putting together the team.

236
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:14,430
You know Roy Waterman,Vice President of Capital and Risk

237
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:16,600
He's actually...

238
00:09:16,630 --> 00:09:17,800
Roy the janitor.

239
00:09:17,830 --> 00:09:19,430
Hey. Excuse me, Roy.

240
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:21,460
How'd you like to make a few extra bucks

241
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:25,160
How naked do I have to get

242
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,330
Louisa Mendoza,Executive Vice President of Assets

243
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,930
She's actually...

244
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:32,760
Louisa the lunch lady.

245
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:34,860
Louisa, I need your help with something,

246
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:36,800
but you can't tell anybody.

247
00:09:36,830 --> 00:09:39,000
No hablo Ingles.

248
00:09:39,030 --> 00:09:40,360
Exactly.

249
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:42,460
This is a big secret.

250
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:44,060
How do you say "secret" in Spanish

251
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:46,060
Albondigas

252
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:49,000
Ah, yes. Albondigas.

253
00:09:49,030 --> 00:09:53,130
This will be our little albondigas.

254
00:09:54,030 --> 00:09:56,300
Hey, can I, uh,have a couple meatballs, please

255
00:09:57,860 --> 00:10:00,130
And Arthur Nasmith,the eccentric genius guru

256
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:02,000
of corporate investments

257
00:10:02,030 --> 00:10:03,460
He's actually...

258
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:07,100
Crazy Arty,15th Street's own one-man band.

259
00:10:07,130 --> 00:10:08,060
Excuse me.

260
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:09,130
Do you have a minute to talk

261
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:10,900
Actually, my assistant, Reginald,

262
00:10:10,930 --> 00:10:11,960
makes all my appointments.

263
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:19,730
<i>We rounded out the group with a few interns</i>

264
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,930
<i>and paid everyone 50 bucks to act
super interested in what you were saying.</i>

265
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:33,700
Reginald, get me out of this for next week.

266
00:10:33,730 --> 00:10:36,360
That was some of the most inspired design work

267
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:38,230
I've done in my entire career.

268
00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:39,400
I was so excited.

269
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:44,700
Alex Trebek, a "Musty Goaltender,"

270
00:10:44,730 --> 00:10:46,230
-Beanie Babies! -Nope.

271
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:47,260
Damn it!

272
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:48,600
Wait.

273
00:10:48,630 --> 00:10:51,530
So that explains the thing that happened with Louisa.

274
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:53,360
-Good job, buddy. -Nice, nice!

275
00:10:56,900 --> 00:10:58,630
Listen, Louisa.

276
00:10:58,660 --> 00:11:02,360
What are we going to do about this

277
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:06,030
Don't act like you don't know what I'm talking about.

278
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:07,530
I know you feel it, too.

279
00:11:08,830 --> 00:11:10,530
What the hell.

280
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:14,030
No, no puedo.

281
00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:16,600
Me voy a casar con el senor Barney.

282
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:23,130
No! No!

283
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:24,930
No, this is wrong!

284
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:28,160
For God's sake,you're on the task force!

285
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:32,230
Is there anything else you want to tell me

286
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:36,060
Well, um, you know how you played

287
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:37,960
third base for the GNB softball team

288
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,130
There is no GNB softball team.

289
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:43,430
We just rented out a field,

290
00:11:43,460 --> 00:11:44,960
rounded up a bunch of guys and told them

291
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,360
to make you the hero.

292
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:48,700
So my game-winning walk was a lie

293
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:51,200
We're sorry, Ted, but we knew that

294
00:11:51,230 --> 00:11:52,560
you'd be out of work soon, and we just--

295
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:53,960
we just wanted to make you feel good.

296
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:54,960
You know, that's what friends do.

297
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,230
Lie to each other

298
00:11:56,260 --> 00:11:58,730
Sometimes, yeah, to protect each other's feelings.

299
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:01,130
No way! You never lie to your friends.

300
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:02,730
I would never not be honest with you.

301
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:04,030
Really? What about that

302
00:12:04,030 --> 00:12:06,230
open mic night at the comedy club

303
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:08,500
Are you like me, folks

304
00:12:08,530 --> 00:12:10,400
Have you ever thought about how many

305
00:12:10,430 --> 00:12:12,360
different kinds of fish there are

306
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:16,300
And the names of those fish.

307
00:12:17,430 --> 00:12:19,130
Let's, uh, let's take a little ride.

308
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:24,560
"Trout." Am I right

309
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:27,260
"Sturgeon." I don't think so, pal.

310
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:29,700
"Salmon."

311
00:12:29,730 --> 00:12:32,830
I'm going to say that again, salmon.

312
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:34,800
Who thought that was a good idea, right

313
00:12:34,830 --> 00:12:38,060
"Bass." This guy over here knows what I'm talking about.

314
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:41,000
"Halibut."

315
00:12:41,030 --> 00:12:42,700
Thank you, good night.

316
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:46,700
How was I

317
00:12:46,730 --> 00:12:48,760
Oh, you were great. Really funny.

318
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:51,100
You killed...

319
00:12:51,130 --> 00:12:54,260
everyone's Thursday night.

320
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:55,600
Time out.

321
00:12:55,630 --> 00:12:57,430
You didn't like the fish list

322
00:12:57,460 --> 00:13:00,500
It was horrible! You just read a list of fish.

323
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:06,230
Anyway...

324
00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:08,130
you guys just proved my point, okay

325
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:09,960
You lied to me to protect my feelings.

326
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,330
This is completely different!

327
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:15,130
I just wasted a month of my life working on a dead project.

328
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:16,230
That's time I could've spent

329
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:17,730
trying to bring my firm new business.

330
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:20,660
Instead, I'm going to go in there tomorrow morning.

331
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:22,030
I'm probably going to get fired.

332
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:23,630
Best case scenario,

333
00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:26,460
my boss is going to ream me out in front of everybody.

334
00:13:28,330 --> 00:13:29,560
...
Back home, we call that a Sas...

335
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:30,600
"Saskatoon Totem Pole."

336
00:13:30,630 --> 00:13:31,630
Yes. It's on here.

337
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:39,960
Good morning, lying bastards.

338
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,900
Anything you want to lie about

339
00:13:41,930 --> 00:13:43,930
before I head off to work to get fired

340
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:45,700
- That's a nice shirt. - You're the devil.

341
00:13:45,730 --> 00:13:47,800
Ted, what if we told you that we found you

342
00:13:47,830 --> 00:13:50,060
a new project at GNB where you would be

343
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:51,800
redesigning part of the 20th floor

344
00:13:51,830 --> 00:13:54,360
Well, if that's a lie, it's an incredibly dull one.

345
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:56,760
What exactly would I be doing

346
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:59,760
This is the 18th Floor E.T.R.

347
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:02,330
Basically, Bilson wants a room just like this,

348
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:04,030
only two stories up, on our floor.

349
00:14:04,060 --> 00:14:05,230
Wait, what's an E.T.R.

350
00:14:05,260 --> 00:14:07,500
It's the Employee Transition Room.

351
00:14:07,530 --> 00:14:10,000
-What does that mean -Well, it's a space

352
00:14:10,030 --> 00:14:12,160
where a supervisor and an employee

353
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:14,000
engage in a knowledge transfer

354
00:14:14,030 --> 00:14:16,700
about an impending vocational paradigm shift.

355
00:14:17,830 --> 00:14:19,030
People get fired in here.

356
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:21,300
That's horrible.

357
00:14:21,330 --> 00:14:23,500
Why do you need a room specifically for firing people

358
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:26,830
Well, um, GNB feels that people need a safe,

359
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:29,260
secure space to deal with the news.

360
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:30,660
Yeah.

361
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:32,730
It gets pretty real in here.

362
00:15:18,430 --> 00:15:21,330
So I reluctantly agreed to design a room

363
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:23,000
where people would be fired

364
00:15:23,030 --> 00:15:24,630
But I was determined to make it my own.

365
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:26,600
Now, when you leave the dismissal space,

366
00:15:26,630 --> 00:15:28,230
you'll exit into what

367
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:32,000
I'm calling the Rebirth Tranquility Hallway.

368
00:15:32,030 --> 00:15:34,130
Uh-oh.

369
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:37,000
Here, you'll find a soothing oval chamber

370
00:15:37,030 --> 00:15:39,000
with a trained grief counselor.

371
00:15:39,030 --> 00:15:41,060
It's right here, past the New Beginnings Fountain.

372
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:42,730
Uh-oh.

373
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:43,930
And there you have it.

374
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:46,760
Instead of a drab, dark prison cell,

375
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:48,900
a nurturing womb...

376
00:15:50,130 --> 00:15:53,460
birthing you into a new life.

377
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:54,600
I love it.

378
00:15:54,630 --> 00:15:56,300
-Really -Yeah.

379
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:57,460
Nice work, Ted.

380
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:58,500
Thank you.

381
00:15:58,530 --> 00:15:59,800
Can you add some of these touches

382
00:15:59,830 --> 00:16:01,960
to the existing 18th Floor E.T.R. as well

383
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
-Absolutely. -Great.

384
00:16:04,030 --> 00:16:06,360
Let's take a look.

385
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,760
Okay, so I'm thinking this wall...

386
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:12,760
You're fired!

387
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:13,800
What!

388
00:16:13,830 --> 00:16:14,930
I wanted this room!

389
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:17,960
This exact room two floors up!

390
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:18,730
But...

391
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:20,330
You're fired!

392
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:21,500
Now, get the hell out of here.

393
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:26,700
Hey, honey.

394
00:16:32,330 --> 00:16:34,260
Anyone from the band Rush,

395
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:37,700
a "Montreal Meatpie," and superhero lunch boxes.

396
00:16:37,730 --> 00:16:39,160
No.

397
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:42,000
Okay. Rick Moranis,

398
00:16:42,030 --> 00:16:44,000
"The Reverse Rick Moranis,"

399
00:16:44,030 --> 00:16:45,560
antique Judaica.

400
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,530
-Nah-uh. -I give up.

401
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:49,860
I've been guessing for three days.

402
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:51,000
I-I-I'm done.

403
00:16:51,030 --> 00:16:52,660
If that means I never get to know,

404
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:54,500
-so be it. -Fine.

405
00:16:54,530 --> 00:16:56,000
Tell us!  Tell us!

406
00:16:56,030 --> 00:16:57,360
Tell us!

407
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:58,930
Okay, you really want to know

408
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:00,300
Yes! Yes! Yes!

409
00:17:01,530 --> 00:17:03,160
But this information

410
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:04,860
does not leave this table.

411
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,800
Oh, my, God.

412
00:17:07,830 --> 00:17:09,330
I am so excited.

413
00:17:10,860 --> 00:17:12,400
-Oh... I'm going to read it. -Read it.

414
00:17:12,430 --> 00:17:13,530
-I'm going to read it. -Read it.

415
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:15,460
I'm going to read it. Here we go.

416
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:17,800
"The Frozen Snowshoe,

417
00:17:17,830 --> 00:17:21,730
Old King Clancy, Harvey's trays."

418
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:25,430
Right

419
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:28,460
I don't know what any of those words mean.

420
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:32,360
Is one of those supposed to be a celebrity

421
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:36,100
Yeah, who the hell is Old King Clancy

422
00:17:36,130 --> 00:17:38,330
No, that's not the person,

423
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:39,530
that's the sex act.

424
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:41,700
It's the same as a Sacramento Turtleneck,

425
00:17:41,730 --> 00:17:43,200
except with maple syrup.

426
00:17:43,230 --> 00:17:46,860
So the celebrity was Harvey Straze

427
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:48,730
No, that's what he collected.

428
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:49,960
Harvey's trays.

429
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:52,200
Those classic orange trays you get

430
00:17:52,230 --> 00:17:53,430
whenever you eat at Harvey's

431
00:17:54,230 --> 00:17:56,130
The restaurant

432
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:57,660
Oh, come on, you're road tripping

433
00:17:57,700 --> 00:17:59,330
down the Trans-Canada Highway,

434
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:01,860
you get a hunger on between Milverton and Wawa,

435
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:04,030
where you gonna strap on a feed bag, huh

436
00:18:04,060 --> 00:18:06,760
12,000
Harvey's. Over 12,000 served!

437
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:09,330
So the celebrity was...

438
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:11,560
The Frozen Snowshoe.

439
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:13,530
Oh, my God! You guys

440
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:16,230
have never heard of The Frozen Snowshoe

441
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:17,400
He's only the most famous

442
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:19,800
professional wrestler in Canada.

443
00:18:19,830 --> 00:18:23,400
I met him after he defeated Reckless Rick Rogers

444
00:18:23,430 --> 00:18:25,960
in the Kamloops Memorial Arena back in '02.

445
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,330
Classic match.

446
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:31,300
So you're saying The Frozen Snowshoe

447
00:18:31,330 --> 00:18:33,530
invited you back to his place

448
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:35,660
to look at Harvey's trays,

449
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:38,760
and asked you to do an Old King Clancy

450
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:40,230
Exactly.

451
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:43,330
And I'm serious, you cannot tell anyone.

452
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:45,860
Well, my hiccups are gone.

453
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:47,330
Possibly forever.

454
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:49,060
Canada!

455
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:50,760
You did it again.

456
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:53,530
You even found a way to ruin this.

457
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:57,430
Why Why do we let you be a country

458
00:18:57,460 --> 00:18:59,160
Hey, mister mister.

459
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:00,630
Hey. Shouldn't you be upstairs

460
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:02,430
designing your big, fancy E.T.R.

461
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:04,900
-I'm off the project. -What

462
00:19:04,930 --> 00:19:06,400
Bilson fired me.

463
00:19:06,430 --> 00:19:07,530
You're kidding me.

464
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:10,000
So what does this mean for you at your firm

465
00:19:10,030 --> 00:19:11,330
Are you going to get laid off

466
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:14,300
Actually, I just quit.

467
00:19:14,330 --> 00:19:15,300
Why

468
00:19:15,330 --> 00:19:16,860
Because I can't work for big,

469
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:18,730
heartless corporate clients anymore.

470
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:21,000
When I was pitching to your "task force,"

471
00:19:21,030 --> 00:19:23,100
I was doing the most inspired work of my career.

472
00:19:23,130 --> 00:19:26,460
In a way, you idiots reminded me how much fun

473
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:28,330
my job can be when I'm not answering

474
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:29,960
to the Bilsons of the world, so...

475
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,160
I quit.

476
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:35,130
They fired you, didn't they

477
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:37,030
Yes, sir.

478
00:19:37,060 --> 00:19:38,630
But I got a sweet severance package

479
00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:40,160
and I've made a big decision.

480
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:42,330
I'm going to start my own firm.

481
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:43,230
Whoa, buddy. That's exciting.

482
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:44,500
Way to go. In this economy

483
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:47,760
So you're not mad

484
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:51,060
As it turns out, I'm grateful.

485
00:19:53,430 --> 00:19:55,260
So how'd it all go down between you and Bilson

486
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:59,060
Well, after he proposed a vocational paradigm shift,

487
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:02,100
I made an impromptu presentation using a four-pronged approach

488
00:20:02,130 --> 00:20:03,560
that really brought him to his knees.

489
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:04,560
Hit him with a chair

490
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:06,100
-Yep. -That's my boy.

491
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:11,730
And this one, I got on the drive

492
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:12,930
from Milverton to Wawa.

493
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:17,700
That's pretty impressive, The Frozen Snowshoe.

494
00:20:17,730 --> 00:20:19,730
Please, we're friends. Just call me "Shoe."

495
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:22,100
Have a seat.

496
00:20:27,230 --> 00:20:29,360
So, Shoe...

497
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:31,900
How would you like to give me...

498
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:36,260
an Old King Clancy

499
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:40,630
I think you should go.
