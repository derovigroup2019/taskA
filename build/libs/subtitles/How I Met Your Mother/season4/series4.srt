1
00:00:02,583 --> 00:00:05,143
Barney is crazy
if he thinks this is gonna work.

2
00:00:05,253 --> 00:00:07,279
- I think it's gonna work.
- I hope it doesn't work.

3
00:00:07,389 --> 00:00:09,357
Here he comes.

4
00:00:12,896 --> 00:00:15,160
- You there, what's your name?
- Excuse me?

5
00:00:15,265 --> 00:00:17,597
Your name, woman, what's your name?

6
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:19,862
- Cindy.
- I knew it.

7
00:00:19,970 --> 00:00:21,267
You're the Cindy,

8
00:00:21,372 --> 00:00:26,367
the one who can change everything,
or spell our inevitable doom.

9
00:00:26,478 --> 00:00:28,275
Now listen to me, Cindy.

10
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:32,977
I am Barney Stinson, and I am
on an urgent mission from the future.

11
00:00:33,085 --> 00:00:36,077
- The future?
- The future, and I can prove it to you.

12
00:00:36,189 --> 00:00:37,520
In exactly four seconds,

13
00:00:37,623 --> 00:00:40,115
the woman at that booth
is going to slap that man.

14
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:45,130
Ow! What the hell?

15
00:00:45,232 --> 00:00:47,030
- Wow!
- In a few minutes,

16
00:00:47,135 --> 00:00:52,232
the young me from your time
is going to come through that door.

17
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:58,246
Now, Cindy, I know this sounds insane,
but in order to save the planet,

18
00:00:58,347 --> 00:01:01,647
you need to sleep with him tonight.

19
00:01:01,751 --> 00:01:05,152
- What? I...
- Sleep with Barney Stinson tonight,

20
00:01:05,255 --> 00:01:07,383
in whatever way he wants it,

21
00:01:07,492 --> 00:01:10,893
or he won't be able to find
the solution to global warming

22
00:01:10,995 --> 00:01:12,860
that saves the human race.

23
00:01:12,964 --> 00:01:15,957
- What are you talking about?
- I have no time to explain.

24
00:01:16,068 --> 00:01:20,369
I have to get back to the reality accelerator
before the vortex closes.

25
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:25,133
Only you can save us, Cindy. I must away!

26
00:01:26,613 --> 00:01:29,640
Okay, guys, the movers are coming
in 14 hours.

27
00:01:29,750 --> 00:01:31,547
We've got to get back upstairs
and finish packing.

28
00:01:31,652 --> 00:01:35,089
You guys still aren't finished packing?
How is this taking so long?

29
00:01:35,190 --> 00:01:38,626
Hey, all the great memories of our 20s
took place in that apartment.

30
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:41,696
It's not like throwing stuff in a box.
You start to reminisce.

31
00:01:41,797 --> 00:01:44,527
Not me. The key?
Throw stuff out, never look back.

32
00:01:44,634 --> 00:01:46,932
I'm moving to Japan.
It took me a half hour to pack.

33
00:01:47,036 --> 00:01:49,232
- A half hour?
- Well, it would have taken me 20 minutes,

34
00:01:49,339 --> 00:01:51,102
but a friend called me in tears.

35
00:01:51,208 --> 00:01:56,374
- Moving is really emotional, okay?
- It is. I mean, everything is changing.

36
00:01:56,481 --> 00:01:58,039
I'm gonna be living in New Jersey
with Stella,

37
00:01:58,149 --> 00:01:59,411
you guys will be in your new place.

38
00:01:59,517 --> 00:02:01,952
- You're starting a new job in Tokyo.
- Hmm.

39
00:02:02,054 --> 00:02:04,079
I mean, it's the end of an era.

40
00:02:04,189 --> 00:02:06,783
I think we should have a toast,
but not our usual crap.

41
00:02:06,892 --> 00:02:10,124
Hey, Wendy,
your most expensive bottle of Scotch.

42
00:02:10,230 --> 00:02:14,189
That's 50-year-old Glen McKenna,
and it's $2,500.

43
00:02:14,302 --> 00:02:17,032
Excellent.
A bottle of that with beer chasers,

44
00:02:17,138 --> 00:02:20,369
- and what do you think, cancel the Scotch?
- Yeah.

45
00:02:21,443 --> 00:02:24,742
- Vodka rocks.
- It's not gonna work.

46
00:02:24,846 --> 00:02:30,410
Oh, my God! You're... Oh, my God!
Can I buy you a drink?

47
00:02:32,021 --> 00:02:36,015
Oh. Yeah,
I suppose I have time for one drink

48
00:02:36,126 --> 00:02:38,617
and 45 minutes to an hour
of some other activity,

49
00:02:38,729 --> 00:02:39,991
but after that, I have to get back

50
00:02:40,097 --> 00:02:43,192
to a top-secret research project
I'm working on.

51
00:02:44,035 --> 00:02:48,700
- Global warming?
- My God! How did you know that?

52
00:03:03,324 --> 00:03:04,655
Hey, look at this.

53
00:03:04,759 --> 00:03:07,319
A photo from the first day
we moved into this place.

54
00:03:09,365 --> 00:03:10,832
So many great memories.

55
00:03:10,933 --> 00:03:14,869
See? That is exactly the type
of crap you should be trashing.

56
00:03:14,970 --> 00:03:16,905
So you don't keep any photos?

57
00:03:17,007 --> 00:03:20,534
No, they're like love letters
or yearbooks or someone's ashes.

58
00:03:20,644 --> 00:03:22,203
They just take up space.

59
00:03:22,313 --> 00:03:24,804
Besides, Stella's not gonna
let you keep half of this junk.

60
00:03:24,915 --> 00:03:26,143
Why wouldn't she?

61
00:03:27,618 --> 00:03:29,416
Oh, Ted, oh, sweetie.

62
00:03:29,521 --> 00:03:33,651
Okay, here's the thing that guys only learn
after they move in with a woman.

63
00:03:33,759 --> 00:03:36,558
- All of your stuff is stupid.
- Like what?

64
00:03:36,829 --> 00:03:40,390
Um... Like anything you bought
at a Renaissance fair.

65
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:44,870
Hey, there's not enough mead in the world
to make me get rid of my flail.

66
00:03:45,372 --> 00:03:48,705
Oh, hey, Ted, since we're clearly
not getting our security deposit back,

67
00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:50,971
I thought maybe you could reimburse me
for my half.

68
00:03:51,079 --> 00:03:53,639
Wait a second.
Why should I have to pay more than you?

69
00:03:53,748 --> 00:03:55,079
Because you treated this apartment

70
00:03:55,183 --> 00:03:57,846
the way John Bonham
treated his central nervous system.

71
00:03:57,953 --> 00:04:00,786
- That's not true.
- Exhibit A.

72
00:04:03,493 --> 00:04:05,120
- Hey.
- Hey.

73
00:04:05,228 --> 00:04:09,165
- What's that?
- A 1986 World Book Encyclopaedia.

74
00:04:09,267 --> 00:04:12,634
- It's exactly the one I grew up with.
- Encyclo-pay-dia?

75
00:04:12,737 --> 00:04:16,230
Oh. You think it should
be pronounced encyclo-pee-dia.

76
00:04:16,341 --> 00:04:17,740
It's a common mistake.

77
00:04:17,843 --> 00:04:21,802
But if you look up that squished together
"A-E" symbol in this here encyclopaedia,

78
00:04:21,914 --> 00:04:26,045
you'll learn that it's a ligature derived
from the Anglo-Saxon rune ash...

79
00:04:32,626 --> 00:04:34,890
You know, you're gonna have
to pay-dia for that.

80
00:04:36,431 --> 00:04:40,026
But you never did.
And then, there's Exhibit B.

81
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:48,538
Good morrow, fair gentles.
Look what I won at the Renaissance Faire.

82
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:55,548
And you're also responsible
for any damage Robin did

83
00:04:55,652 --> 00:04:59,180
- while she was your girlfriend.
- Whoa! What damage did I cause?

84
00:04:59,491 --> 00:05:01,322
Do you remember that night
when you drank the 12er of Molson

85
00:05:01,426 --> 00:05:03,657
and you got all super-Canadian?

86
00:05:06,565 --> 00:05:09,125
Stanley Cup, Game 6, eh?

87
00:05:09,235 --> 00:05:13,229
The Rangers are about to be sorry
they ever played shinny with the Canucks.

88
00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:14,807
Hey. Hey, Robin.
- Yeah?

89
00:05:14,908 --> 00:05:17,036
I'll give you 20 bucks if you
can shoot it through this front door.

90
00:05:18,446 --> 00:05:21,609
You're nuttier
than a Tim Horton's maple log.

91
00:05:21,816 --> 00:05:23,181
Timmy Ho!

92
00:05:24,686 --> 00:05:26,881
That's it, Robin. Give me the stick.

93
00:05:28,056 --> 00:05:32,118
I'll give you summer teeth.
Some are here, some are there.

94
00:05:32,529 --> 00:05:34,588
Robin, give me the stick.

95
00:05:34,697 --> 00:05:37,098
- Take off, hoser.
Whoa!

96
00:05:37,201 --> 00:05:38,725
- That's it!
- Hey, hey!

97
00:05:38,836 --> 00:05:40,770
- Get her, boys, get her!
- You want to scrap? I'll scrap!

98
00:05:40,871 --> 00:05:43,066
- Guys, come on!
- Go America!

99
00:05:43,174 --> 00:05:46,508
All right. All right, break it, break it up!

100
00:05:46,611 --> 00:05:52,482
Ted, no! You never break up a girl fight!
Never!

101
00:05:55,755 --> 00:06:00,693
Entirely Barney's fault. As, by the way,
is the big scorch mark over the fireplace.

102
00:06:03,197 --> 00:06:05,826
<i>Kids, to understand the story
of the scorch mark,</i>

103
00:06:05,934 --> 00:06:09,426
<i>I first need to tell you the story
of the intervention for our friend Stuart.</i>

104
00:06:09,537 --> 00:06:13,804
- What's going on?
- Stuart, this is an intervention.

105
00:06:15,377 --> 00:06:20,145
"The alcohol changes you, Stuart.
It makes you a different person.

106
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:23,276
"And I'm in love
with the man that I married. "

107
00:06:24,055 --> 00:06:25,352
Thank you.

108
00:06:26,257 --> 00:06:30,626
This is just the push I need.
I love you guys.

109
00:06:32,231 --> 00:06:35,997
Hey, hey! There's the birthday boy.

110
00:06:36,101 --> 00:06:39,697
Time to let the party monster
out of its cage, Stewie!

111
00:06:39,806 --> 00:06:42,468
- No!
- Come on, buddy.

112
00:06:42,809 --> 00:06:45,108
People don't want to see
Bruce Banner, dude.

113
00:06:45,212 --> 00:06:49,876
They want to see the Hulk.
Hulk. Hulk. Hulk. What?

114
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:52,678
Oh.

115
00:06:56,758 --> 00:06:59,523
That's what I get for skimming the Evite.

116
00:07:00,730 --> 00:07:04,188
<i>Later that day, we celebrated
our first successful intervention.</i>

117
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:06,735
I'm really proud of us for helping Stuart.

118
00:07:06,837 --> 00:07:10,102
Yeah, what an amazing,
honest, human moment.

119
00:07:10,207 --> 00:07:12,233
I agree. Yay us.

120
00:07:12,710 --> 00:07:15,508
Marshall, are you really gonna
keep wearing that hat?

121
00:07:15,613 --> 00:07:17,547
Yeah, it's been two weeks, Marshall.

122
00:07:17,649 --> 00:07:22,553
Two awesome weeks.
And heck, yeah, I'm gonna keep wearing it.

123
00:07:29,496 --> 00:07:31,361
- Hey.
- Marshall,

124
00:07:33,034 --> 00:07:35,059
this is an intervention.

125
00:07:35,603 --> 00:07:41,804
- It's about the hat.
- What? No. I have it under control, okay?

126
00:07:42,544 --> 00:07:44,876
I can take it off whenever I want.

127
00:07:46,015 --> 00:07:48,313
"Dear Marshall,

128
00:07:48,418 --> 00:07:53,584
"I do not like that stupid hat.
I want to beat it with a bat.

129
00:07:53,691 --> 00:07:58,720
"Or maybe stab it with a fork.
It makes you look like such a dork. "

130
00:07:59,497 --> 00:08:01,124
<i>After that,
interventions became a</i>

131
00:08:01,232 --> 00:08:02,927
<i>pretty regular thing around our apartment.</i>

132
00:08:06,739 --> 00:08:09,139
Cor blimey.

133
00:08:09,241 --> 00:08:11,903
This is a nice bloody surprise.
What's this about, then?

134
00:08:12,446 --> 00:08:16,576
Lily, it's about
the weird, fake English accent.

135
00:08:17,651 --> 00:08:18,880
Bollocks.

136
00:08:20,588 --> 00:08:21,577
I think we should...

137
00:08:25,326 --> 00:08:26,692
Spray tan?

138
00:08:29,531 --> 00:08:31,999
They reel you in with a coupon,
and then you just get hooked.

139
00:08:32,101 --> 00:08:36,471
Oh, we know, sweetie, we know.
No, no, no, no, this is a new sweater.

140
00:08:40,044 --> 00:08:42,740
- What?
- The magic tricks.

141
00:08:42,847 --> 00:08:47,046
- Specifically, those involving fire.
- Magic tricks?

142
00:08:47,152 --> 00:08:50,087
Guys, interventions are supposed
to help people,

143
00:08:50,188 --> 00:08:53,681
not attack every little thing
you don't like about them.

144
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:58,397
I'm sorry, but that really steams me.
That really burns me up!

145
00:08:59,299 --> 00:09:03,827
I mean, I am filled with a white-hot rage!

146
00:09:09,677 --> 00:09:11,167
Thank you.

147
00:09:13,349 --> 00:09:15,214
- Oh, shoot.
- I smell hair! I smell hair!

148
00:09:15,317 --> 00:09:17,410
<i>And that's the story
of the scorch mark.</i>

149
00:09:18,154 --> 00:09:19,280
Wait, that's weird.

150
00:09:19,388 --> 00:09:23,655
When I was going through the closet,
I thought I saw the intervention banner.

151
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:24,852
So?

152
00:09:24,961 --> 00:09:28,295
So, the banner burned up.
Why is there a new one?

153
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:32,358
And there are sealed letters
here from all of you that say "Ted. "

154
00:09:32,804 --> 00:09:35,205
Were you guys planning
an intervention for me?

155
00:09:35,307 --> 00:09:38,640
Oh, that. That was stupid.
Yeah, just forget about that.

156
00:09:38,744 --> 00:09:40,940
What was it for? The Crocs?

157
00:09:41,881 --> 00:09:44,076
- The hair product?
- Not Stella.

158
00:09:45,351 --> 00:09:47,547
Oh, my God, this was about Stella.

159
00:09:47,655 --> 00:09:53,492
I just said "Not Stella. " So maybe it was
about your poor listening skills, Ted.

160
00:09:53,595 --> 00:09:55,961
- What?
- It's out of control. See?

161
00:09:56,932 --> 00:09:59,799
You guys don't think I should marry Stella.

162
00:10:03,239 --> 00:10:05,002
You guys don't think I should marry Stella.

163
00:10:05,108 --> 00:10:07,907
Ted, we do. We're all really happy for you.

164
00:10:08,011 --> 00:10:11,469
- Yeah, like I said, it was stupid.
- Well, obviously, it wasn't,

165
00:10:11,582 --> 00:10:13,744
because we agreed not to have
any more stupid interventions

166
00:10:13,852 --> 00:10:15,046
at our intervention intervention.

167
00:10:17,155 --> 00:10:19,214
We're having too many interventions.

168
00:10:20,426 --> 00:10:24,021
So, what was your big, serious
problem with me and Stella?

169
00:10:24,697 --> 00:10:28,065
Yes! Yes! In everyone's face!

170
00:10:28,168 --> 00:10:30,159
You all said the future-Barney thing
wouldn't work.

171
00:10:30,270 --> 00:10:34,765
You told me I was crazy.
My shrink told me I was crazy.

172
00:10:34,876 --> 00:10:39,176
Well, who's the narcissist with severe
attachment disorder now, Dr. Grossbard?

173
00:10:41,717 --> 00:10:44,652
- Intervention banner? What's that for?
- Stella.

174
00:10:44,753 --> 00:10:45,720
Oh.

175
00:10:47,857 --> 00:10:51,520
- "Ted, I cannot stand idly by... "
- You've just been carrying that around?

176
00:10:51,628 --> 00:10:55,224
Please, Ted? "I cannot stand idly by

177
00:10:55,332 --> 00:10:59,769
"while you make the biggest mistake
any man can make. Getting married.

178
00:10:59,870 --> 00:11:05,707
"Mark my words, this whole thing
is gonna go up in flames!"

179
00:11:06,611 --> 00:11:09,809
Oh, damn! I put the flame cue too early.

180
00:11:09,916 --> 00:11:11,975
I had so many more
important things to say, and...

181
00:11:12,084 --> 00:11:17,113
The point is, Ted, marriage is stupid.

182
00:11:18,091 --> 00:11:23,792
Every year, there are a million
new, hot 22-year-olds walking into bars,

183
00:11:23,898 --> 00:11:27,926
and call me "glass-half-full,"
but I think they're getting dumber.

184
00:11:28,337 --> 00:11:29,497
Oh, come on, Barney,

185
00:11:29,605 --> 00:11:33,666
even you aren't still gonna be
hitting on 22-year-olds when you're 80.

186
00:11:33,776 --> 00:11:36,507
- I accept that challenge.
- What challenge?

187
00:11:36,613 --> 00:11:41,779
To prove to you that I will be exactly
this awesome when I'm 80,

188
00:11:41,886 --> 00:11:46,482
I will hook up with a 22-year-old
while in my old-man makeup.

189
00:11:47,258 --> 00:11:50,023
I didn't remotely challenge you to that.

190
00:11:50,128 --> 00:11:54,656
I mean, I definitely want to see it.
But I didn't remotely challenge you to that.

191
00:11:54,766 --> 00:11:57,998
- I want to hear the other letters.
- Ted, this is ridiculous.

192
00:11:58,104 --> 00:12:01,437
- We changed our minds.
- And suppose you change them back?

193
00:12:01,541 --> 00:12:03,840
Lily, come on, let's hear yours.

194
00:12:08,015 --> 00:12:11,383
"Gilbert's reading skills have
improved drastically since... "

195
00:12:11,486 --> 00:12:16,015
Wait, this is a letter I meant to send home
with one of my kindergarteners.

196
00:12:16,292 --> 00:12:17,281
Uh-oh.

197
00:12:17,393 --> 00:12:21,831
Gilbert, are things moving too fast
between you and a girl named Stella?

198
00:12:22,466 --> 00:12:23,626
I wish.

199
00:12:27,471 --> 00:12:29,463
Robin, could I hear yours?

200
00:12:35,246 --> 00:12:39,081
"Dear Ted, it's encyclo-pee-dia,
not encyclo-pay-dia.

201
00:12:39,184 --> 00:12:42,245
"Why do you always say things
in the most pretentious way possible?

202
00:12:42,355 --> 00:12:46,849
"It makes you sound douchey,
and that's douche-ee, not douch-ay. "

203
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:50,488
Yeah, you already read that one
at my pronunciation intervention.

204
00:12:50,598 --> 00:12:54,227
- Where's the letter about Stella?
- I didn't write one. I'm your ex-girlfriend.

205
00:12:54,335 --> 00:12:57,499
I figured anything I said on the subject
would sound catty.

206
00:12:57,606 --> 00:13:00,302
Plus, I'm hotter than her, so who cares?

207
00:13:02,345 --> 00:13:03,505
Marshall?

208
00:13:03,613 --> 00:13:06,605
- Dude, it's water under the bridge...
- Please.

209
00:13:13,557 --> 00:13:17,494
"Dear Ted,
Stella seems like a wonderful person.

210
00:13:19,664 --> 00:13:22,896
"But you don't know her
well enough to get married.

211
00:13:23,002 --> 00:13:24,469
"You certainly don't know her well enough

212
00:13:24,570 --> 00:13:27,630
"to commit
to raising a 7-year-old with her.

213
00:13:28,841 --> 00:13:35,338
"You're not doing her, her child or yourself
any favors by rushing into this.

214
00:13:35,449 --> 00:13:36,917
"Just give it some more time. "

215
00:13:39,087 --> 00:13:43,252
Dude, that was months ago, all right?
That was before we got to know Stella,

216
00:13:43,359 --> 00:13:46,920
and see how awesome she is
and what a great couple you guys are.

217
00:13:47,029 --> 00:13:49,897
That's why we decided not
to even have that intervention.

218
00:13:49,999 --> 00:13:52,900
Thank you. Because I really need you guys
to be on board with this.

219
00:13:53,002 --> 00:13:55,664
- And we are.
- We hope you're not mad at us.

220
00:13:55,772 --> 00:13:59,539
Of course not. I mean,
it's not like what you said was crazy.

221
00:14:00,778 --> 00:14:03,179
- You had a lot of valid concerns.
- Yeah, but concerns

222
00:14:03,281 --> 00:14:05,715
we have completely moved on from.

223
00:14:05,817 --> 00:14:09,948
But you had a point. I mean,
this whole thing has moved pretty fast.

224
00:14:10,056 --> 00:14:13,924
Well, you know what? Maybe that's
because when it's right, you just know.

225
00:14:14,026 --> 00:14:18,327
Yeah, I guess, but we are still
getting to know each other.

226
00:14:18,732 --> 00:14:23,066
And, Lily, maybe you're right.
Maybe Stella won't like any of my stuff.

227
00:14:23,605 --> 00:14:25,869
Like the robot cookie jar.

228
00:14:26,641 --> 00:14:28,871
This was, like, the first thing
we bought for this place, remember?

229
00:14:28,977 --> 00:14:30,502
Yeah, of course I do.

230
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:33,210
Marshall,
my sensors indicate

231
00:14:33,315 --> 00:14:36,773
that your pecan-sandy levels
are dangerously low.

232
00:14:38,121 --> 00:14:41,488
My collection of
James Bond movies.

233
00:14:41,591 --> 00:14:43,286
Remember? We watched them all in order,

234
00:14:43,393 --> 00:14:46,886
and then Lily spoke in that weird
English accent for, like, the next month?

235
00:14:46,998 --> 00:14:48,431
- It was sophisticated.
- No.

236
00:14:48,566 --> 00:14:49,794
- Nope.
- No.

237
00:14:50,669 --> 00:14:55,333
My signed Bernie Kosar cleats.
My elephant lamp.

238
00:14:55,441 --> 00:14:58,741
The English phone booth. My sombrero!

239
00:15:01,614 --> 00:15:04,049
- Ted, what are you doing?
- Unpacking.

240
00:15:04,151 --> 00:15:06,881
I am never
leaving this apartment.

241
00:15:14,029 --> 00:15:17,431
No, no, Ted, stop unpacking.
You're just freaking out.

242
00:15:17,533 --> 00:15:19,057
I'm not ready for all the responsibility.

243
00:15:19,168 --> 00:15:23,264
And I'm certainly not ready to be
a stepdad to a 7-year-old.

244
00:15:23,372 --> 00:15:26,604
I mean, if I get married and move
to the suburbs, in the blink of an eye,

245
00:15:26,710 --> 00:15:28,075
I've become an old man!

246
00:15:30,681 --> 00:15:33,173
Why, hello, young lady.

247
00:15:33,418 --> 00:15:35,613
You want a butterscotch candy?

248
00:15:36,488 --> 00:15:40,152
What do you mean, "Nothing in common?"
We're both seniors.

249
00:15:44,464 --> 00:15:48,764
- You're cute. How old are you?
- 83.

250
00:15:48,869 --> 00:15:51,030
- How old are you?
- Thirty-one.

251
00:15:54,742 --> 00:15:57,142
Okay, Ted has officially snapped.

252
00:15:57,245 --> 00:15:59,407
There are moving men coming
in 10 hours.

253
00:15:59,515 --> 00:16:03,474
His fianc?e is waiting for him
in New Jersey. We have to do something.

254
00:16:03,585 --> 00:16:04,917
I've got this.

255
00:16:08,458 --> 00:16:10,756
- Hey, bud?
- Hey.

256
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:13,921
- Why don't you come here for a minute?
- What?

257
00:16:14,031 --> 00:16:17,489
Look, I want you to know
this is all totally normal.

258
00:16:17,601 --> 00:16:22,869
Big transitions can be scary, and cold feet,
well, they're just part of the deal.

259
00:16:22,974 --> 00:16:28,106
So how about you give me the knife?
Give me the knife.

260
00:16:29,015 --> 00:16:30,277
Come on.

261
00:16:33,053 --> 00:16:34,281
So I can start unpacking, too.

262
00:16:34,388 --> 00:16:36,356
I'm staying here
right by your side forever, buddy!

263
00:16:36,456 --> 00:16:37,480
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

264
00:16:37,591 --> 00:16:41,688
- Marshall!
- Lily, our lives have been good here.

265
00:16:41,796 --> 00:16:43,457
That's why we've been putting off packing.

266
00:16:43,565 --> 00:16:47,024
Because, subconsciously, we both know
that it would be stupid to leave.

267
00:16:47,136 --> 00:16:50,196
It's safe and warm here.
There's a bar downstairs

268
00:16:50,306 --> 00:16:52,036
and a cookie robot in the kitchen.

269
00:16:52,142 --> 00:16:55,134
- This is my home, and I'm never leaving!
- Listen to you.

270
00:16:55,245 --> 00:16:57,805
You sound like that fat,
dweeby kid at camp.

271
00:16:57,914 --> 00:16:59,542
"Mom, Dad, I want to come home.

272
00:16:59,650 --> 00:17:02,448
"The cool kids are playing Keep Away
with my inhaler. "

273
00:17:02,553 --> 00:17:05,317
I can't believe my dad
read that letter at our wedding.

274
00:17:05,424 --> 00:17:06,891
Marshall, you can't do this to Lily.

275
00:17:06,992 --> 00:17:09,085
Yes, I know your new place
has had some problems,

276
00:17:09,194 --> 00:17:12,528
with the slanted floors
and the nearby sewage treatment plant,

277
00:17:12,632 --> 00:17:16,090
but you're gonna turn it into a great home.
Tell him, Lily.

278
00:17:16,202 --> 00:17:20,162
It's a black hole where dreams go to die.
I'm not moving, either.

279
00:17:20,274 --> 00:17:21,605
- Oh, come on!
- Yes!

280
00:17:21,709 --> 00:17:23,734
Okay, you guys finish unpacking.

281
00:17:23,844 --> 00:17:26,712
I'm gonna go bake some cookies
to fill R2-Sweet Tooth.

282
00:17:27,649 --> 00:17:32,383
Oh, my God, look at you cowards!
So afraid of any kind of change.

283
00:17:32,488 --> 00:17:34,319
So terrified of anything new.

284
00:17:34,457 --> 00:17:38,154
So desperate to cling to anything
comfortable and familiar.

285
00:17:38,260 --> 00:17:40,024
I can't move to Japan.

286
00:17:40,397 --> 00:17:41,557
- Yes!
- Whoa!

287
00:17:41,665 --> 00:17:46,069
What was I thinking? It's so far away
and I don't speak the language.

288
00:17:46,170 --> 00:17:48,400
I don't even have any good pictures
of you guys.

289
00:17:48,506 --> 00:17:50,167
Oh, sweetie.

290
00:17:50,608 --> 00:17:54,670
Everybody says change is so great, right?
But what's so great about change?

291
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:57,442
Hey, who wants to walk
down to our same old bar,

292
00:17:57,549 --> 00:17:59,814
sit in our regular booth
and order the usual?

293
00:17:59,919 --> 00:18:02,945
- Yeah!
- The usual! My favorite!

294
00:18:05,892 --> 00:18:07,622
Oh, my God.

295
00:18:12,934 --> 00:18:18,873
Well, well, well.
I believe someone owes me $200.

296
00:18:18,974 --> 00:18:21,102
Barney, this was never a bet. Nobody...

297
00:18:21,210 --> 00:18:25,044
This proves that I will be
this awesome when I'm 80.

298
00:18:25,148 --> 00:18:27,117
Arthritis-five.

299
00:18:30,354 --> 00:18:31,753
I'm moving to New Jersey.

300
00:18:31,855 --> 00:18:33,847
- What?
- And you and Marshall should move

301
00:18:33,958 --> 00:18:36,188
to your new place,
and Robin should go to Japan.

302
00:18:36,294 --> 00:18:37,261
Why?

303
00:18:37,362 --> 00:18:39,830
Because we're gonna get older
whether we like it or not,

304
00:18:39,932 --> 00:18:43,766
so the only question is,
whether we want to get on with our lives

305
00:18:43,869 --> 00:18:47,499
or desperately cling to the past
and end up like that?

306
00:18:47,607 --> 00:18:49,234
You mean awesome?

307
00:18:49,576 --> 00:18:54,207
I'm 80, dude,
and I'm making out with a 22-year-old.

308
00:18:55,083 --> 00:18:57,347
<i>Take me to your place, ch?ri.</i>

309
00:18:57,485 --> 00:19:02,514
<i>- I want to see your World War II medals.
- In a minute, mon petit.</i>

310
00:19:02,891 --> 00:19:06,054
- All right, so that doesn't count.
- What? Why?

311
00:19:06,161 --> 00:19:09,757
She's French. That's like playing tennis
with the net down.

312
00:19:09,866 --> 00:19:13,063
You know what?
I'll cover the security deposit.

313
00:19:13,169 --> 00:19:16,139
I'm glad to,
because every dent in that place

314
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:18,538
represents a memory
that I'll cherish forever.

315
00:19:18,642 --> 00:19:23,482
But on one condition. We all put aside
10 bucks every week for the next year,

316
00:19:23,582 --> 00:19:26,745
and we come back here
and we buy that 50-year-old Scotch,

317
00:19:26,852 --> 00:19:30,550
and we toast the incredible
life-changing year we've all had.

318
00:19:30,656 --> 00:19:32,419
Get out of our booth.

319
00:19:35,662 --> 00:19:38,756
Me with my new family,
Marshall and Lily in their new apartment,

320
00:19:38,866 --> 00:19:42,132
and Robin as the number-one
English-speaking journalist

321
00:19:42,237 --> 00:19:47,334
in the Pacific Rim, visiting us
here in New York to celebrate this day,

322
00:19:47,443 --> 00:19:50,810
the day we closed
an incredible chapter in our lives,

323
00:19:50,913 --> 00:19:52,847
only to open up a new one.

324
00:19:53,516 --> 00:19:56,816
- Um. I think I left my cell...
- Get out of here!

325
00:19:58,755 --> 00:20:00,552
<i>And one year later,
that's exactly what we did.</i>

326
00:20:01,759 --> 00:20:06,162
And so, let's raise a glass of $2,500 Scotch
for one hell of a year.

327
00:20:06,264 --> 00:20:07,231
Hmm.

328
00:20:10,769 --> 00:20:12,862
- Amazing.
- That's unbelievable.

329
00:20:12,971 --> 00:20:16,635
It's kind of smoky,
with a hint of aged cedar, and...

330
00:20:16,743 --> 00:20:18,802
Do you guys taste the difference
between this and $10 Scotch?

331
00:20:18,912 --> 00:20:19,936
- Not at all.
- No difference.

332
00:20:20,046 --> 00:20:21,446
I want to cut mine with Red Bull.

333
00:20:21,549 --> 00:20:24,109
- Oh, Wendy, will you take a picture?
- Sure.

334
00:20:24,885 --> 00:20:27,353
<i>A lot of things
did change that year,</i>

335
00:20:27,822 --> 00:20:29,120
<i>but some things stayed the same.</i>

336
00:20:29,825 --> 00:20:33,488
So, what do you say we move this party
upstairs to the apartment?

337
00:20:33,595 --> 00:20:35,120
- Yeah.
- Great idea.

338
00:20:44,374 --> 00:20:46,035
What the...

339
00:20:47,177 --> 00:20:49,510
Barney, this is an intervention.

340
00:20:50,348 --> 00:20:53,010
I'm sorry, I can't hear you.

341
00:20:53,117 --> 00:20:58,021
- All right, enough with the old-man bit.
- What about the old sand pit?

342
00:20:58,123 --> 00:21:03,221
- Let it go.
- Let it snow? I love that old ditty!

343
00:21:05,031 --> 00:21:08,524
- I'm getting my flail.
- You're setting sail?
