1
00:00:02,204 --> 00:00:05,002
<i>Kids, in the fall of 2008,
I had a little problem.</i>

2
00:00:05,107 --> 00:00:07,075
All right, I gotta get to Stella's.

3
00:00:08,544 --> 00:00:11,138
Tonight's the night, guys.
I've tried it before. I've failed every time.

4
00:00:11,246 --> 00:00:16,274
This time, I am gonna do it.
Tonight I pick up a lesbian.

5
00:00:18,887 --> 00:00:22,790
- Robin, I need your lipstick.
- Oh, man!

6
00:00:23,893 --> 00:00:26,123
- Take pictures, all right?
- Bye, Ted.

7
00:00:28,364 --> 00:00:29,729
<i>I lived in New York,</i>

8
00:00:30,834 --> 00:00:34,292
<i>but Stella lived across the river
in New Jersey.</i>

9
00:00:36,172 --> 00:00:37,537
Oh, man.

10
00:00:39,609 --> 00:00:41,736
<i>Which meant
I was always taking the train.</i>

11
00:00:41,845 --> 00:00:44,177
- What's up, Ted?
- Hey, Matisse.

12
00:00:45,615 --> 00:00:47,446
- Hey, T-Diddy!
- Theodore!

13
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:49,848
- You missed it.
- Robin got that national anchor job.

14
00:00:49,953 --> 00:00:51,818
And we got a free bottle of champagne.

15
00:00:51,921 --> 00:00:55,187
- But it's empty now.
- Oh, man.

16
00:00:55,659 --> 00:00:59,459
<i>And as result, it seemed like
I was missing out on everything.</i>

17
00:01:00,130 --> 00:01:02,189
Sorry, we couldn't wait.
It was getting cold.

18
00:01:02,299 --> 00:01:03,323
Oh, man!

19
00:01:03,434 --> 00:01:05,527
- Hey, big guy.
- What's up, G?

20
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:08,534
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine. It's just,

21
00:01:08,639 --> 00:01:10,231
you know,
I wanna hang out with you guys.

22
00:01:10,341 --> 00:01:11,603
I wanna hang out with my friends.

23
00:01:11,709 --> 00:01:14,371
I just feel like
I'm spending all my time on the train.

24
00:01:14,478 --> 00:01:16,036
Okay, how about this.
Why don't you ask your friends

25
00:01:16,146 --> 00:01:19,445
- to come out here sometime?
- That's a great idea.

26
00:01:19,783 --> 00:01:22,752
You want us to go to New Jersey?
That is rich.

27
00:01:22,853 --> 00:01:24,821
- Why?
- Well, for starters,

28
00:01:24,922 --> 00:01:27,390
I don't have
any of my gold medallions anymore.

29
00:01:27,491 --> 00:01:31,121
I sold them when they went out of style
400 years ago.

30
00:01:31,696 --> 00:01:33,664
- Lily?
- Sorry, Ted.

31
00:01:33,765 --> 00:01:35,426
I'm a born and raised New Yorker.

32
00:01:35,533 --> 00:01:39,367
I'm programmed to despise and loathe
New Jersey and all that it stands for.

33
00:01:39,471 --> 00:01:42,804
Why am I telling you this?
You hate New Jersey more than anyone.

34
00:01:42,908 --> 00:01:45,399
What? I don't hate New Jersey.
Why would you think that?

35
00:01:46,011 --> 00:01:47,478
And then he cut in front of me!

36
00:01:47,579 --> 00:01:51,174
God, I hate line cutters
more than I hate New Jersey!

37
00:01:52,083 --> 00:01:56,042
Well, that's not true. There is nothing
I hate more than New Jersey.

38
00:01:57,289 --> 00:01:58,256
Huh?

39
00:02:00,892 --> 00:02:02,052
Right?

40
00:02:03,795 --> 00:02:05,320
Hey, you want us to wait for you or...

41
00:02:05,431 --> 00:02:08,628
No, I might be a while.
I gotta drop a massive New Jersey.

42
00:02:09,869 --> 00:02:12,633
Okay, so New Jersey's
not my favorite place.

43
00:02:12,738 --> 00:02:15,798
But once Stella and I get married
and she and Lucy move in with me,

44
00:02:15,908 --> 00:02:18,001
I'll never set foot in New Jersey again.

45
00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:21,102
Unless I'm going to see a Giants game
or flying out of Newark

46
00:02:21,213 --> 00:02:23,704
or, God forbid, disposing of a body.

47
00:02:24,050 --> 00:02:26,883
Ted, if you murder me
and bury me in New Jersey,

48
00:02:26,986 --> 00:02:28,851
I'll haunt you forever.

49
00:02:29,288 --> 00:02:31,756
But if I murder you
and bury you somewhere else?

50
00:02:31,857 --> 00:02:34,758
I'll leave you alone.
I'm sure you had your reasons.

51
00:02:49,843 --> 00:02:53,279
<i>Kids, your Aunt Robin was
sick of her job at Metro News 1.</i>

52
00:02:53,380 --> 00:02:55,109
<i>She was sick of the low production value...</i>

53
00:02:55,215 --> 00:02:57,877
I'm Robin Scherbatsky,
and you're watching

54
00:02:59,586 --> 00:03:01,554
Etro News 1 at 11:00.

55
00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:05,251
And again at 1:00.

56
00:03:06,193 --> 00:03:07,990
<i>...sick of the stories she had to report...</i>

57
00:03:08,095 --> 00:03:12,930
So hurry up and get your votes in
for New York's cutest doggie.

58
00:03:14,135 --> 00:03:16,797
<i>...and most of all,
she was sick of all the stupid puns.</i>

59
00:03:16,904 --> 00:03:21,170
Four transit workers were electrocuted
when a subway train jumped the tracks.

60
00:03:21,275 --> 00:03:26,679
Stay tuned for the shocking derails.
Joel, people died.

61
00:03:29,017 --> 00:03:32,180
<i>So when the call came in
that she got the big national anchor job,</i>

62
00:03:32,286 --> 00:03:35,915
<i>she finally got to say the words
she'd been dreaming of saying for years.</i>

63
00:03:36,024 --> 00:03:38,185
<i>Tonight will be my last broadcast.</i>

64
00:03:38,292 --> 00:03:41,386
<i>I came to Metro News 1
as a little caterpillar,</i>

65
00:03:41,496 --> 00:03:45,125
<i>and for four years,
this desk has been my cocoon.</i>

66
00:03:46,167 --> 00:03:50,298
<i>But tonight,
I emerge an ambitious butterfly.</i>

67
00:03:51,006 --> 00:03:53,406
Why does she sound like an idiot?
Did she have a stroke?

68
00:03:53,509 --> 00:03:57,969
Yeah. A stroke of genius.
This speech is really good.

69
00:03:59,381 --> 00:04:03,010
<i>With one eye on the horizon,
one eye on the truth,</i>

70
00:04:03,886 --> 00:04:06,446
<i>and one eye on all of you.</i>

71
00:04:07,489 --> 00:04:09,719
You wrote it for her, didn't you?

72
00:04:10,292 --> 00:04:13,489
It's a modified version of the speech I gave
when I had to leave the swim team

73
00:04:13,595 --> 00:04:15,859
because of a chronic inner ear situation.

74
00:04:15,964 --> 00:04:19,400
- I thought you were the towel boy.
- It's part of the team.

75
00:04:19,501 --> 00:04:22,732
<i>So that Saturday, as Robin went off
for her first day at her new job,</i>

76
00:04:22,838 --> 00:04:24,033
<i>we all headed across the river</i>

77
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:26,802
<i>to experience
some of that crazy New Jersey nightlife.</i>

78
00:04:26,976 --> 00:04:29,467
Okay, Stella couldn't find a sitter,
so we can't go out.

79
00:04:29,579 --> 00:04:34,175
Instead, we're all gonna hang out here,
and it's gonna be just as awesome.

80
00:04:34,284 --> 00:04:36,718
Right? We got board games,
we got movies,

81
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:40,221
and I think there may be some beer
out in the garage.

82
00:04:43,026 --> 00:04:46,826
Ted, this is pathetic. It's Saturday night.
We should be out at a bar drinking alcohol.

83
00:04:46,930 --> 00:04:50,161
Now I know that that sounds depressing,
bordering on tragic, but it's just a fact!

84
00:04:50,266 --> 00:04:52,757
Yeah, and I wanna take another crack
at that chick, Doris.

85
00:04:52,869 --> 00:04:56,305
- I know I can land that lesbian plane.
- No snakes on that plane.

86
00:04:58,508 --> 00:05:03,344
Okay, guys. Come on, you promised.
Let's just hang out here, try to have fun.

87
00:05:03,447 --> 00:05:05,381
I mean, we're all together.

88
00:05:05,483 --> 00:05:08,281
Friends hanging out.
Isn't that what really matters?

89
00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:15,520
Okay, if we take the next train,
we can be at MacLaren's by 11:00.

90
00:05:15,626 --> 00:05:17,457
- We can be there by 10:00.
- No, I have to change first.

91
00:05:17,561 --> 00:05:19,859
I am not walking into MacLaren's
smelling like New Jersey.

92
00:05:19,964 --> 00:05:21,454
Whoa.

93
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:26,759
Wow. You guys really hate it here, huh?

94
00:05:26,871 --> 00:05:29,704
What? No, Stels.

95
00:05:30,307 --> 00:05:32,468
No. No, I get it.
I mean, you guys are all New Yorkers.

96
00:05:32,576 --> 00:05:33,737
You need to go hang out at a bar.

97
00:05:33,845 --> 00:05:36,643
Well, you could just hang out
at the coolest bar in the state,

98
00:05:36,748 --> 00:05:39,444
which is so close it will blow your mind.

99
00:05:41,052 --> 00:05:45,352
And boom goes the dynamite.
The coolest bar in New Jersey.

100
00:05:45,457 --> 00:05:48,551
- Yeah, it probably is.
- This is great!

101
00:05:49,161 --> 00:05:52,358
We got darts. Half a ping-pong table.

102
00:05:52,764 --> 00:05:55,232
A fish bowl. Look what turned out to be

103
00:05:55,634 --> 00:05:57,101
an awesome night as promised.

104
00:05:57,202 --> 00:05:59,864
Maybe we can drop some Bac-Os in here
and make them fight.

105
00:05:59,971 --> 00:06:03,907
No, thanks. I don't mess with fish bowls
unless they have my two favorite fish,

106
00:06:04,009 --> 00:06:07,706
the suckerfish and the blowfish. What up!

107
00:06:08,714 --> 00:06:11,205
For blowfish? I don't think so.

108
00:06:13,586 --> 00:06:15,713
- Marshall.
- You're better than that.

109
00:06:15,821 --> 00:06:17,914
- Lily.
- Not good enough.

110
00:06:18,691 --> 00:06:19,919
Stella?

111
00:06:22,695 --> 00:06:23,855
Sorry.

112
00:06:24,964 --> 00:06:28,263
I am not lowering this
until someone gives me the respect

113
00:06:28,367 --> 00:06:31,564
of another person's knuckles
tapping against mine

114
00:06:31,671 --> 00:06:34,139
in a light but decisive manner.

115
00:06:35,775 --> 00:06:39,609
Pretty, pretty. Pretty, pretty. Pretty...
Who's a pretty baby?

116
00:06:41,614 --> 00:06:46,712
Then know this.
Until it gets what it wants, nay, deserves,

117
00:06:47,521 --> 00:06:50,081
this fist will not yield.

118
00:06:51,658 --> 00:06:55,526
It will not yield.

119
00:06:57,397 --> 00:07:00,059
- So who wants to play Scrabble?
- Sure, whatever.

120
00:07:00,267 --> 00:07:02,462
Heads up, the X tile is a little hard to read

121
00:07:02,569 --> 00:07:05,436
'cause a couple years ago,
it went all the way through my dog.

122
00:07:07,241 --> 00:07:09,232
You know,
maybe we should get a dog again,

123
00:07:09,343 --> 00:07:11,004
- when you move in.
- When I what?

124
00:07:12,412 --> 00:07:14,471
Great. There's Robin.

125
00:07:20,154 --> 00:07:23,521
- I thought they were moving in with you?
- So did I.

126
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:28,324
Oh, God, am I moving to New Jersey?

127
00:07:29,097 --> 00:07:31,588
Hey, guys, I bet that dog
was really flying high

128
00:07:31,699 --> 00:07:35,533
after it swallowed a little X. Nailed it!

129
00:07:37,305 --> 00:07:38,829
Come on!

130
00:07:42,910 --> 00:07:45,777
- I can't live here.
- It wouldn't be that bad.

131
00:07:46,314 --> 00:07:49,147
You could put a minifridge over there
and maybe some Nok Hockey.

132
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:51,616
Nok Hockey. Nice one, big man.

133
00:07:52,287 --> 00:07:55,451
Yeah, I meant New Jersey in general,
not this basement.

134
00:07:55,557 --> 00:07:59,220
She wants me to move here? I don't get it.
We discussed this months ago.

135
00:07:59,862 --> 00:08:04,856
So I was thinking after the wedding,
you and Lucy could move in here.

136
00:08:06,402 --> 00:08:09,064
Yeah, she could play
out on the fire escape,

137
00:08:09,171 --> 00:08:12,004
maybe make friends with that guy
who sleeps on that couch out in the alley,

138
00:08:12,107 --> 00:08:16,203
ride her bike up and down Broadway.
That's a great idea, Ted.

139
00:08:18,213 --> 00:08:21,148
Look, I don't understand
why you'd want to live in New Jersey

140
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:23,115
when you have a chance
to live in Manhattan.

141
00:08:23,218 --> 00:08:25,413
I thought having a rent-controlled
apartment on the Upper West Side

142
00:08:25,521 --> 00:08:27,045
was half the reason
she agreed to marry me.

143
00:08:27,156 --> 00:08:30,558
Really, I thought it was the whole reason.
What is up?

144
00:08:31,328 --> 00:08:33,796
- Hey.
- Robin, hey! Looking good.

145
00:08:34,364 --> 00:08:37,458
- Bump the Barnacle.
- Stella already told me not to.

146
00:08:37,567 --> 00:08:39,501
- How was your first day?
- It wasn't.

147
00:08:39,602 --> 00:08:41,536
- What?
- It wasn't my first day.

148
00:08:41,638 --> 00:08:43,606
I showed up
and there were 20 other people.

149
00:08:43,707 --> 00:08:47,074
It turns out, I didn't actually get the job.
I only got an audition.

150
00:08:47,177 --> 00:08:48,769
- What, how did that happen?
- I don't know,

151
00:08:48,878 --> 00:08:50,345
because he told me that I got it.

152
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:52,409
I got it? I got it!

153
00:08:53,883 --> 00:08:56,317
<i>And just to be clear,
when I say "you got it,"</i>

154
00:08:56,419 --> 00:09:00,287
<i>I mean an audition. You got an audition.</i>

155
00:09:00,824 --> 00:09:05,159
<i>I don't want there to be any confusion.
You have an audition only.</i>

156
00:09:05,529 --> 00:09:06,928
<i>Not the job.</i>

157
00:09:08,332 --> 00:09:09,697
Thank you! Thank you!

158
00:09:10,468 --> 00:09:12,959
Okay, I'm gonna call and beg Joel
to give me my job back.

159
00:09:13,070 --> 00:09:15,163
- No.
- You hated that job.

160
00:09:15,272 --> 00:09:16,637
I don't know. It wasn't so bad.

161
00:09:16,741 --> 00:09:19,301
Robin, what did they make you call
Tropical Storm Hector

162
00:09:19,410 --> 00:09:21,344
when it was raining cats and dogs?

163
00:09:21,645 --> 00:09:23,169
A furricane.

164
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:24,645
Hey, Ted.

165
00:09:25,349 --> 00:09:27,909
- Rock me like a furricane.
- Nice.

166
00:09:28,586 --> 00:09:29,644
Mean.

167
00:09:30,121 --> 00:09:33,955
Okay, yeah, it sucks, but what can I do?
I mean, I'm not gonna get that other job.

168
00:09:34,058 --> 00:09:36,117
You guys should have seen
the other women at this audition.

169
00:09:36,227 --> 00:09:39,459
They all had more experience than me,
were more ethnic than me.

170
00:09:39,564 --> 00:09:42,124
There was an African-American chick
with blue eyes.

171
00:09:42,234 --> 00:09:43,929
How can I compete with that?

172
00:09:44,169 --> 00:09:45,295
You can't.

173
00:09:45,470 --> 00:09:47,301
No, you can compete with anyone.

174
00:09:47,406 --> 00:09:51,342
You're Robin Scherbatsky.
You're confident, strong, tall,

175
00:09:51,443 --> 00:09:54,071
with crazy long legs
that look great in shorts.

176
00:09:54,179 --> 00:09:55,305
I'm calling Joel.

177
00:09:55,414 --> 00:09:58,850
No, no. Robin, if you call him right now,
you will hate yourself.

178
00:09:58,984 --> 00:10:02,283
Look, I have slept with lots of women
who afterwards told me off

179
00:10:02,788 --> 00:10:05,757
and stormed out. And sometimes,
they'd pick up the phone

180
00:10:05,857 --> 00:10:08,519
and they'd call me,
and then we'd hook up again.

181
00:10:08,627 --> 00:10:11,562
And when we were finished,
I could see that look on their faces,

182
00:10:11,663 --> 00:10:16,192
that look that says they hate themselves
and they wish they'd never called.

183
00:10:16,836 --> 00:10:18,531
But if you could see that look...

184
00:10:18,638 --> 00:10:21,573
Actually, you can see that look,
there's a video, www...

185
00:10:21,674 --> 00:10:24,142
No, no! Stop, okay? I won't call.

186
00:10:25,011 --> 00:10:27,377
Don't drink the beer!
I just remembered when I bought it.

187
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:29,414
It was right before
I got pregnant with Lucy.

188
00:10:29,515 --> 00:10:32,075
Ted, would you mind
running to PriceCo and picking some up?

189
00:10:32,251 --> 00:10:34,048
And while you're there,
maybe you could sign up for a card.

190
00:10:34,153 --> 00:10:37,645
I mean, you'll probably
end up going there all the time.

191
00:10:39,459 --> 00:10:41,017
That's the look.

192
00:10:43,262 --> 00:10:46,959
I can't move here. I hate it here.
I would kill myself.

193
00:10:47,066 --> 00:10:50,503
Maybe New Jersey's not that bad, okay?
Stella has a lawn.

194
00:10:50,604 --> 00:10:53,198
You could get a riding lawn mower.
They sell them over there.

195
00:10:53,307 --> 00:10:57,403
I saw one with a cup holder.
I saw a recliner with a built-in cup holder.

196
00:10:57,511 --> 00:10:59,206
I even saw a hammock with a cup holder.

197
00:10:59,313 --> 00:11:01,747
You live in New Jersey,
you never have to hold a cup again.

198
00:11:01,849 --> 00:11:04,750
I don't think I have as big a problem
holding cups as you do.

199
00:11:04,852 --> 00:11:08,720
I will give you $100 to fist bump me.

200
00:11:10,757 --> 00:11:12,122
$200.

201
00:11:12,392 --> 00:11:16,226
Just put it down, Barney.
Your arm must be killing you by now.

202
00:11:18,265 --> 00:11:19,789
$10,000.

203
00:11:21,001 --> 00:11:23,630
Look, you'll be right across the river.
You'll be in New York all the time.

204
00:11:23,738 --> 00:11:25,399
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

205
00:11:25,874 --> 00:11:28,035
Excuse me.
You guys are from New York, right?

206
00:11:28,142 --> 00:11:29,769
Yeah, we moved here from Manhattan.

207
00:11:29,878 --> 00:11:32,142
- Do you ever get into the city?
- All the time.

208
00:11:32,247 --> 00:11:33,441
See? All the time.

209
00:11:33,548 --> 00:11:36,779
- When was the last time you were there?
- We just had dinner at O'Rourke's.

210
00:11:36,885 --> 00:11:38,910
That's been closed for six years.

211
00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:41,955
Maybe it has been a while.
Funny, we don't miss it.

212
00:11:42,056 --> 00:11:46,083
I guess we're New Jersey-ians now.
Honey, look, dog shirts.

213
00:11:48,663 --> 00:11:50,654
I can't do it. I'm just gonna tell Stella

214
00:11:50,765 --> 00:11:53,393
she and Lucy have to move
into the city and that's that.

215
00:11:53,501 --> 00:11:57,529
Okay, what do you guys think?
Beagle or Boston terrier?

216
00:12:01,510 --> 00:12:03,375
Are those tears?

217
00:12:04,713 --> 00:12:08,774
They're awesome, manly pain tears.
They're not emotional.

218
00:12:10,319 --> 00:12:12,879
Okay, they're a little bit emotional.

219
00:12:13,656 --> 00:12:15,123
Where's Robin?

220
00:12:16,492 --> 00:12:17,925
Oh, no. She's...

221
00:12:18,961 --> 00:12:21,395
Hey, Shirley, it's Robin calling for Joel.

222
00:12:21,497 --> 00:12:24,864
- Robin, hang up the phone. Don't do this.
- Sorry, I know, okay?

223
00:12:24,967 --> 00:12:29,404
- If you don't hang up right now...
- Stop! Hey, Joel, it's Robin.

224
00:12:29,772 --> 00:12:32,332
So Madam Butterfly
wants to come back to the cocoon.

225
00:12:33,610 --> 00:12:35,669
Yeah, look, I'm sorry I said all that stuff.

226
00:12:35,779 --> 00:12:37,770
Well, you can stick your sorries
in your sock drawer

227
00:12:37,881 --> 00:12:39,405
'cause you've already been replaced.

228
00:12:39,516 --> 00:12:42,542
I've got Brian in makeup
and he couldn't be more excited.

229
00:12:42,919 --> 00:12:45,513
I can't do this. I can't do this.

230
00:12:45,855 --> 00:12:50,224
Okay, look, as much as I wanna see
college boy here wet himself on camera,

231
00:12:50,327 --> 00:12:52,227
if you can get here in time
to read the 11:00 news,

232
00:12:52,329 --> 00:12:53,455
you can have your old job back.

233
00:12:54,764 --> 00:12:57,358
Okay, I have a half hour
to make it to the studio.

234
00:12:57,467 --> 00:12:59,628
There's no way
you can make it to the city in a half hour.

235
00:12:59,736 --> 00:13:00,725
Robin, don't do this.

236
00:13:00,837 --> 00:13:04,102
I know it's scary to bet on yourself,
but if you don't, nobody else will.

237
00:13:04,207 --> 00:13:05,902
And I'm not just saying that
to get a fist bump.

238
00:13:06,009 --> 00:13:08,444
Although, come on, a fist bump
would be great. But I really mean that.

239
00:13:08,546 --> 00:13:12,846
I am betting on myself. I am betting
that I can make it there by 11:00.

240
00:13:28,966 --> 00:13:30,058
Hey, did you get the beer?

241
00:13:30,167 --> 00:13:34,228
Yeah, I got a 144-pack.
The rest is in the trunk.

242
00:13:34,338 --> 00:13:37,239
- And did you sign up for the membership?
- No.

243
00:13:38,109 --> 00:13:39,974
- Why not?
- There was a line for the photos.

244
00:13:40,077 --> 00:13:43,377
My hair's a mess.
I don't wanna move to New Jersey.

245
00:13:44,116 --> 00:13:45,777
- What?
- I can't do it,

246
00:13:45,884 --> 00:13:49,513
and I can't see any reason why
you and Lucy shouldn't move to New York.

247
00:13:49,621 --> 00:13:51,486
Well, my daughter goes to school here,

248
00:13:51,590 --> 00:13:53,615
all of her friends are here,
I've lived here my whole life,

249
00:13:53,725 --> 00:13:56,626
my whole family is here,
this is my house, I'm on the PTA

250
00:13:56,728 --> 00:13:59,561
and, as of June 1, I'm the deputy mayor.

251
00:14:01,133 --> 00:14:04,591
Yes, but my apartment
is really close to the subway.

252
00:14:06,238 --> 00:14:08,968
Ted, we're not moving. End of discussion.

253
00:14:09,074 --> 00:14:12,134
How can it be end of discussion
if there's never been a discussion?

254
00:14:12,244 --> 00:14:15,042
This is part of being a parent.
I can't just uproot Lucy.

255
00:14:15,147 --> 00:14:19,278
People with kids move all the time.
I think it would be really great for Lucy

256
00:14:19,385 --> 00:14:20,852
to grow up
in the greatest city in the world.

257
00:14:20,953 --> 00:14:23,615
Here we go. New York's the greatest city
in the whole wide world.

258
00:14:23,723 --> 00:14:26,556
It's where dreams come true
and pigeon poop tastes like tapioca.

259
00:14:26,659 --> 00:14:30,891
Wanna know a little secret, Ted?
New Jersey is better than New York.

260
00:14:31,531 --> 00:14:34,591
Better than... You think... I...

261
00:14:34,967 --> 00:14:38,630
The Empire State... H&H...

262
00:14:38,738 --> 00:14:42,538
Lincoln... Zabar's... Papaya King!

263
00:14:43,376 --> 00:14:46,709
New York is the intellectual
and cultural hub of the planet.

264
00:14:46,813 --> 00:14:50,408
New York is full of weirdoes
and snobs and mean people.

265
00:14:50,516 --> 00:14:52,712
Ted, do you know that, once,
an old lady actually called me a bitch

266
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:54,617
and threw a cat in my face?

267
00:14:54,722 --> 00:14:57,190
And you wanna know if that
happened in New Jersey? Uh-uh.

268
00:14:57,291 --> 00:15:00,590
86th and Lex, right in front
of your beloved little Papaya King.

269
00:15:00,694 --> 00:15:03,424
Ted, people are nice in New Jersey.

270
00:15:03,530 --> 00:15:05,555
I mean, it's the kind of place
where you know your neighbors.

271
00:15:05,666 --> 00:15:08,692
- Hey, I know my neighbors.
- Oh, yeah? Like who?

272
00:15:09,036 --> 00:15:12,062
Right across the hall, I got Claxpamon.

273
00:15:13,006 --> 00:15:15,304
- Claxpamon?
- His name is Paxton.

274
00:15:15,409 --> 00:15:16,899
Love that dude.

275
00:15:18,212 --> 00:15:20,680
Sorry, in a hurry. Gotta get to the front.
Gotta get off first.

276
00:15:21,048 --> 00:15:22,640
Don't run over Matisse.

277
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:24,717
Okay, Stella, this is crazy.

278
00:15:24,818 --> 00:15:28,846
You can't actually think
that New Jersey is better than New York.

279
00:15:28,957 --> 00:15:31,323
New York has Broadway.
We win right there.

280
00:15:31,426 --> 00:15:34,827
Oh, no, she did not. Knuckle up for safety.

281
00:15:35,430 --> 00:15:36,454
We have Atlantic City.

282
00:15:36,564 --> 00:15:39,761
Can't beat the AC. Pretty please?
No one has to know.

283
00:15:40,268 --> 00:15:42,896
- New York has Greenwich Village.
- New Jersey has the Shore.

284
00:15:43,004 --> 00:15:44,028
Woody Allen.

285
00:15:44,139 --> 00:15:48,337
Oscar-winning chronicler
of urban neuroses. Bump it!

286
00:15:48,443 --> 00:15:50,172
- Bruce Springsteen.
- Sinatra!

287
00:15:50,278 --> 00:15:52,337
Yeah, he's from Hoboken, New Jersey.

288
00:15:52,447 --> 00:15:56,907
<i>Yeah, but what city is he singing about?
It's not Secaucus, Secaucus.</i>

289
00:16:01,857 --> 00:16:03,017
Come on.

290
00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:07,390
<i>Now, you kids can either
believe this or not,</i>

291
00:16:07,496 --> 00:16:11,057
<i>but this is how
your Aunt Robin swears it happened.</i>

292
00:16:16,605 --> 00:16:20,166
Look, Stella, I understand that,
coming from New Jersey,

293
00:16:20,276 --> 00:16:22,642
you don't picture yourself
loving New York,

294
00:16:22,745 --> 00:16:25,339
but trust me, Marshall didn't expect to,

295
00:16:25,447 --> 00:16:27,813
and now he wouldn't think
of living anywhere else.

296
00:16:27,917 --> 00:16:29,248
I hate New York!

297
00:16:30,452 --> 00:16:31,976
I'm sorry, but it's true.

298
00:16:32,087 --> 00:16:36,023
Okay, today I was walking around PriceCo.
Have you ever been there? It's huge.

299
00:16:36,125 --> 00:16:39,493
All the stores in New York are so cramped.
Every time I turn, I knock something over.

300
00:16:39,596 --> 00:16:43,464
I'm like some huge monster that came out
of the ocean to destroy bodegas.

301
00:16:43,567 --> 00:16:47,697
- But, Marshall, you love New York.
- Yeah, I do, except that I hate it.

302
00:16:47,804 --> 00:16:49,965
I'm too big for New York, okay?

303
00:16:50,073 --> 00:16:52,564
I'm always trying to fit
into cramped little subway seats

304
00:16:52,676 --> 00:16:55,042
or duck under doorways
that were built 150 years ago.

305
00:16:55,145 --> 00:16:57,943
Hey, guess what? People are bigger now.
Build bigger doorways.

306
00:16:58,048 --> 00:17:01,040
- What the hell is the matter with you?
- Small city, big man, give it up.

307
00:17:01,151 --> 00:17:05,281
And it's so loud all the time.
Yes, it's the city that never sleeps.

308
00:17:05,388 --> 00:17:09,722
Well, guess what, I like to sleep.
I've been tired for eight years.

309
00:17:09,826 --> 00:17:12,421
Tired and scared
with black and blue marks on my elbows

310
00:17:12,530 --> 00:17:14,998
from trying to fit through
all these tiny elf doorways.

311
00:17:15,099 --> 00:17:16,623
New Jersey's great.

312
00:17:16,734 --> 00:17:21,671
It's got huge stores and lawns
and you never have to carry a cup again.

313
00:17:21,772 --> 00:17:27,142
Not for the rest of your life.
I'm not afraid to say it. I love New Jersey.

314
00:17:30,181 --> 00:17:31,808
I'm just kidding.

315
00:17:33,818 --> 00:17:37,276
Look, Stella, I get it, okay?

316
00:17:38,322 --> 00:17:41,655
I see what you're saying. I guess,

317
00:17:43,561 --> 00:17:45,552
we could live in Brooklyn.

318
00:17:46,698 --> 00:17:51,328
You know what, Ted?
Live wherever you want. I don't care.

319
00:17:59,344 --> 00:18:01,403
Awkward silence. Tap it.

320
00:18:13,725 --> 00:18:16,091
Hey, Lucy. What are you doing up?

321
00:18:16,194 --> 00:18:18,685
There were some loud noises
in the basement.

322
00:18:18,797 --> 00:18:20,264
Sorry about that.

323
00:18:20,365 --> 00:18:23,961
- Why don't you get back to bed, sweetie?
- I can't go to sleep without a story.

324
00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:27,870
- Okay, I'll just get your mom...
- Why don't you read it to me?

325
00:18:29,676 --> 00:18:31,143
Okay, come on.

326
00:18:31,244 --> 00:18:34,873
<i>You know she thrills me
with all her charms</i>

327
00:18:36,182 --> 00:18:40,346
<i>When I'm wrapped up
in my baby's arms</i>

328
00:18:41,854 --> 00:18:45,847
<i>My little girl
gives me everything</i>

329
00:18:47,894 --> 00:18:52,991
<i>When I'm walking down the street
with you</i>

330
00:18:53,099 --> 00:18:57,366
<i>Sing sha la la la la la la</i>

331
00:19:00,341 --> 00:19:01,899
I'm moving here.

332
00:19:03,877 --> 00:19:05,970
- Really?
- Really.

333
00:19:07,214 --> 00:19:08,875
New Jersey wins.

334
00:19:29,236 --> 00:19:30,601
Thank you!

335
00:19:31,973 --> 00:19:33,167
Wait!

336
00:19:44,185 --> 00:19:45,174
Good evening, New York.

337
00:19:45,754 --> 00:19:47,619
Hey, look, she made it.

338
00:19:47,822 --> 00:19:49,084
Our top story tonight,

339
00:19:49,190 --> 00:19:52,785
the newborn panda at the Central Park Zoo
got its first tooth today.

340
00:19:52,894 --> 00:19:56,625
I guess that makes her a molar bear.

341
00:19:57,899 --> 00:19:58,957
Molar bear.

342
00:20:00,735 --> 00:20:01,997
Molar bear.

343
00:20:03,838 --> 00:20:08,276
You know what? I really am done.
Good night, New York.

344
00:20:13,416 --> 00:20:15,509
Wow, she really quit.

345
00:20:15,618 --> 00:20:17,984
You think we had anything
to do with that?

346
00:20:18,087 --> 00:20:20,351
Yeah, I think we did.

347
00:20:21,991 --> 00:20:23,583
Nice job, Barney.

348
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:28,491
Oh, my God! Thank you!

349
00:20:30,466 --> 00:20:32,491
That was killing my arm.

350
00:20:32,601 --> 00:20:35,161
My arm hasn't been this sore
since I was 13 years old

351
00:20:35,271 --> 00:20:38,331
and figured out how to lock a bathroom.
Up top.

352
00:20:40,944 --> 00:20:42,138
Oh, no.

353
00:20:45,282 --> 00:20:46,772
- Hey.
- Hey.

354
00:20:46,883 --> 00:20:48,851
- Hey.
- What's wrong?

355
00:20:48,952 --> 00:20:50,920
Well, I officially didn't get that job.

356
00:20:52,089 --> 00:20:53,249
- I'm so sorry.
- That's okay.

357
00:20:53,356 --> 00:20:55,824
They offered me another one.

358
00:20:55,926 --> 00:20:58,258
Hey, that's great.
What are you gonna be doing?

359
00:20:58,361 --> 00:21:02,354
Foreign correspondent.
I'm moving to Japan.
