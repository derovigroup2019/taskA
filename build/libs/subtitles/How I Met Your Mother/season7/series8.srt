1
00:00:00,542 --> 00:00:02,492
<i>Kids, for years, your Uncle Barney</i>

2
00:00:02,493 --> 00:00:05,035
had reveled in mocking
Aunt Robin's Canadian heritage.

3
00:00:05,549 --> 00:00:07,687
To have to grow up
in Canada...

4
00:00:07,688 --> 00:00:09,704
with America right there.

5
00:00:09,706 --> 00:00:12,124
It's like an entire country
without a tailor.

6
00:00:12,126 --> 00:00:15,894
Why? Why do we let
you be a country?!

7
00:00:15,896 --> 00:00:20,715
<i>But all that was about</i>
<i>to change.</i>

8
00:00:20,717 --> 00:00:22,217
I was on Facebook.

9
00:00:22,219 --> 00:00:24,603
Nobody cool's
on Facebook anymore.

10
00:00:24,605 --> 00:00:26,522
Well, you know who is
on Facebook now?

11
00:00:26,524 --> 00:00:28,073
Everybody's parents.

12
00:00:28,075 --> 00:00:30,559
And I just happen
to be friends

13
00:00:30,561 --> 00:00:32,727
with Barney's long-lost father,

14
00:00:32,729 --> 00:00:34,229
Mr. Jerome Whitaker.
- Me, too.

15
00:00:34,231 --> 00:00:35,864
He's gotten really good
at Bejeweled Blitz.

16
00:00:35,866 --> 00:00:39,918
And guess who thought my status
update about Manitoba was

17
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:45,123
so interesting because his
mother was born in Manitoba?

18
00:00:45,125 --> 00:00:46,458
What?

19
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:48,743
Which means your grandmother...

20
00:00:48,745 --> 00:00:49,645
No...

21
00:00:49,647 --> 00:00:50,762
Which makes you...

22
00:00:50,764 --> 00:00:51,964
Don't say it!

23
00:00:51,966 --> 00:00:53,015
...one-quarter Canadian!

24
00:00:55,603 --> 00:00:57,636
Welcome to the tribe, hoser!

25
00:00:57,638 --> 00:00:59,721
No...

26
00:00:59,723 --> 00:01:01,857
it's not true!

27
00:01:01,859 --> 00:01:03,775
That's impossible!

30
00:01:21,971 --> 00:01:24,330
<i>Once upon a time</i>
<i>at a Halloween party,</i>

31
00:01:24,331 --> 00:01:26,731
<i>I met a girl</i>
<i>dressed like a pumpkin...</i>

32
00:01:26,733 --> 00:01:27,732
<i>a slutty pumpkin.</i>

33
00:01:27,734 --> 00:01:29,951
<i>And she was extraordinary.</i>

34
00:01:29,953 --> 00:01:32,671
<i>But she gave me her number</i>
<i>on a Kit Kat bar,</i>

35
00:01:32,673 --> 00:01:35,006
which was tragically given away
<i>as Halloween candy.</i>

36
00:01:35,008 --> 00:01:36,958
<i>So every year I return</i>
<i>to that same party</i>

37
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:38,510
<i>hoping I'd see her again.</i>

38
00:01:38,512 --> 00:01:42,697
But with every passing October,
<i>that hope grew a little dimmer.</i>

39
00:01:42,699 --> 00:01:45,667
<i>Then one day, after ten years</i>
<i>of searching...</i>

40
00:01:45,669 --> 00:01:47,752
Oh, my God.

41
00:01:47,754 --> 00:01:50,021
The slutty pumpkin.

42
00:01:50,023 --> 00:01:52,924
This might sound creepy,
but do you have a record

43
00:01:52,926 --> 00:01:54,593
of who rented it in 2001?

44
00:01:57,613 --> 00:01:58,930
Wow, that was easy.

45
00:01:58,932 --> 00:02:00,815
You're not the first lovelorn
young man

46
00:02:00,817 --> 00:02:01,933
to walk through that door.

47
00:02:01,935 --> 00:02:04,236
Three girls got proposals off

48
00:02:04,238 --> 00:02:07,155
my wife's slutty artichoke
costume.

49
00:02:07,157 --> 00:02:10,492
Two others disappeared,
but I focus on the positive.

50
00:02:10,494 --> 00:02:13,211
<i>I couldn't believe it.</i>
<i>I actually had her address.</i>

51
00:02:13,213 --> 00:02:15,430
<i>I knew I had</i>
<i>to play this right.</i>

52
00:02:15,432 --> 00:02:19,134
It's not like I could just walk
<i>up and knock on her door.</i>

53
00:02:22,838 --> 00:02:26,124
Hi, you probably
don't remember me, but...

54
00:02:26,126 --> 00:02:28,626
Halloween, ten years ago.

55
00:02:29,428 --> 00:02:31,897
Now that's a slow play.

56
00:02:31,899 --> 00:02:35,800
<i>The next day,</i>
<i>Lily and Marshall headed out</i>

57
00:02:35,802 --> 00:02:37,319
<i>to Lily's grandparents</i>
<i>for dinner.</i>

58
00:02:37,321 --> 00:02:39,304
<i>Marshall loved it</i>
<i>out in the 'burbs.</i>

59
00:02:39,306 --> 00:02:40,972
Look how many fireflies
I caught!

60
00:02:40,974 --> 00:02:44,142
Don't forget to poke holes
in the jar this time.

61
00:02:44,944 --> 00:02:47,979
Now we have
a nice surprise for you.

62
00:02:49,081 --> 00:02:51,366
Whatever it is,
we're saying no.

63
00:02:51,368 --> 00:02:53,501
- What?
- You know what.

64
00:02:53,503 --> 00:02:54,753
Every time we're here,

65
00:02:54,755 --> 00:02:57,038
my grandparents stick us with
some big old piece of junk

66
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:58,489
they're getting rid of.

67
00:02:58,491 --> 00:03:01,343
It's like the world's worst
Showcase Showdown.

68
00:03:01,345 --> 00:03:05,046
It's a perfectly
usable lawnmower!

69
00:03:06,466 --> 00:03:08,016
We live in an apartment!

70
00:03:08,018 --> 00:03:09,267
But maybe someday

71
00:03:09,269 --> 00:03:10,719
when we move to the suburbs...

72
00:03:10,721 --> 00:03:12,554
We're never moving
to the suburbs!

73
00:03:12,556 --> 00:03:13,638
And you also get...

74
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:16,141
this skinny microphone!

75
00:03:16,143 --> 00:03:17,892
Oh!

76
00:03:17,894 --> 00:03:21,346
Before we head out
to our place in Florida,

77
00:03:21,348 --> 00:03:23,865
we wanted to give
our favorite granddaughter

78
00:03:23,867 --> 00:03:25,533
a little something.

79
00:03:25,535 --> 00:03:29,871
Ooh, it's so small.
I love it!

80
00:03:29,873 --> 00:03:32,374
- A key?
- We're giving you the house.

81
00:03:32,376 --> 00:03:36,161
Lily, I know you've
always hated the suburbs...

82
00:03:36,163 --> 00:03:38,797
We'll take it!

83
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:41,583
<i>For my first date</i>
<i>with the slutty pumpkin,</i>

84
00:03:41,585 --> 00:03:43,218
<i>I took her someplace special.</i>

85
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:44,869
Ted, this is so romantic.

86
00:03:44,871 --> 00:03:46,805
The spot where
we first met

87
00:03:46,807 --> 00:03:48,506
ten years ago.

88
00:03:48,508 --> 00:03:50,592
Do you remember the song
that was playing that night?

89
00:03:50,594 --> 00:03:53,345
I remember how beautiful
you looked.

90
00:03:53,347 --> 00:03:56,047
? It's been one week
since you looked at me ?

91
00:03:56,049 --> 00:03:58,984
? Cocked your head to the side
and said, "I'm angry." ?

92
00:03:58,986 --> 00:04:00,935
Is that, uh,
the Barenaked Ladies, huh?

93
00:04:00,937 --> 00:04:02,604
? Five days since you laughed
at me ?

94
00:04:02,606 --> 00:04:04,823
? Saying, "Get that together.
Come back and see me." ?

95
00:04:04,825 --> 00:04:09,077
<i>Kids, it took me ten years,</i>
<i>but I finally kissed her.</i>

96
00:04:09,079 --> 00:04:12,563
<i>And it was... terrible.</i>

97
00:04:19,771 --> 00:04:21,271
Lily, you hate the suburbs.

98
00:04:21,387 --> 00:04:23,854
I know, but my grandparents
giving us a house

99
00:04:23,856 --> 00:04:25,389
right when
the baby's on the way?

100
00:04:25,391 --> 00:04:26,506
It's perfect timing.

101
00:04:26,508 --> 00:04:28,525
This is great.
I'm finally gonna be able

102
00:04:28,527 --> 00:04:30,844
to barbecue with
proper ventilation.

103
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:33,731
Marshall!

104
00:04:34,699 --> 00:04:36,233
We're moving
to the suburbs, baby!

105
00:04:36,235 --> 00:04:38,235
Oh...

106
00:04:38,237 --> 00:04:40,738
Okay.

107
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:42,623
Baby, you're not moving
to the suburbs.

108
00:04:42,625 --> 00:04:43,574
Why not?

109
00:04:43,576 --> 00:04:44,958
Lily is only agreeing

110
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:46,710
to all this because
of Pregnancy Brain.

111
00:04:46,712 --> 00:04:48,796
Pregnancy Brain?
That's not a thing.

112
00:04:48,798 --> 00:04:50,030
It's totally a thing.

113
00:04:50,032 --> 00:04:54,668
Her brain is marinating in
a cocktail of hormones,

114
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:57,254
mood swings and jacked-up
nesting instincts.

115
00:04:57,256 --> 00:05:00,557
I mean, yes, right now
Lily is a goddess

116
00:05:00,559 --> 00:05:02,309
bestowing the
miracle of life,

117
00:05:02,311 --> 00:05:04,845
but damn, she dumb!

118
00:05:04,847 --> 00:05:08,182
Well, I have noticed some stuff.

119
00:05:08,184 --> 00:05:11,018
I can't find my keys
or wallet anywhere!

120
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:13,053
I found them...

121
00:05:13,055 --> 00:05:15,555
here in the freezer.

122
00:05:15,557 --> 00:05:17,524
Hey, but where are
the ice cube trays?

123
00:05:17,526 --> 00:05:19,643
No idea.

124
00:05:21,079 --> 00:05:25,065
Those poor ice cubes!

125
00:05:25,067 --> 00:05:28,085
I guess she has been
a little off lately.

126
00:05:28,087 --> 00:05:29,920
A little? She just texted me

127
00:05:29,922 --> 00:05:32,773
wanting directions back
from the bathroom.

128
00:05:32,775 --> 00:05:36,293
Oh. We're over here!

129
00:05:37,412 --> 00:05:39,179
You're doing great, sweetie!

130
00:05:39,181 --> 00:05:42,249
That moron should not be making
big life decisions right now.

131
00:05:42,251 --> 00:05:43,884
If you let her move
to the suburbs,

132
00:05:43,886 --> 00:05:45,936
it would be like taking
advantage

133
00:05:45,938 --> 00:05:47,471
of a helpless drunk chick.

134
00:05:47,473 --> 00:05:49,690
What? Where?!

135
00:05:49,692 --> 00:05:52,359
Oh, I got a girlfriend, right.

136
00:05:54,629 --> 00:05:56,447
Baby, we should put
off moving.

137
00:05:56,449 --> 00:05:57,448
Why?

138
00:05:57,450 --> 00:05:59,199
Because I think
the pregnancy is

139
00:05:59,201 --> 00:06:00,284
affecting your judgment.

140
00:06:00,286 --> 00:06:04,772
No, Marshall, this is
an amazing opportunity

141
00:06:04,774 --> 00:06:07,107
that we have
to take advantage of!

142
00:06:07,109 --> 00:06:09,710
Just because my body
is growing a fungus...

143
00:06:09,712 --> 00:06:11,211
Fetus.

144
00:06:11,213 --> 00:06:12,479
...doesn't mean that my metal
factories...

145
00:06:12,481 --> 00:06:14,214
Meal faculties.

146
00:06:14,216 --> 00:06:16,300
...are in any way funicular.

147
00:06:17,969 --> 00:06:19,470
No idea.

148
00:06:20,305 --> 00:06:24,007
Mmm...

149
00:06:24,009 --> 00:06:25,459
This is nice.
What is this?

150
00:06:25,461 --> 00:06:26,626
Canadian whiskey.

151
00:06:28,229 --> 00:06:31,131
I want scotch!

152
00:06:31,133 --> 00:06:35,519
American scotch
from Scotland!

153
00:06:35,521 --> 00:06:37,971
Get that swill
away from me!

154
00:06:41,109 --> 00:06:43,243
Why are you doing
this to me?

155
00:06:43,245 --> 00:06:45,112
You have been ripping
on Canada

156
00:06:45,114 --> 00:06:47,647
since Justin Bieber was
knee-high to a snow blower.

157
00:06:47,649 --> 00:06:50,650
So now this Canuck's
gonna beat on you

158
00:06:50,652 --> 00:06:53,504
like the drummer from Yukon
Blonde hopped up on Timbits.

159
00:06:53,506 --> 00:06:55,756
- Hey.
- Hey!

160
00:06:55,758 --> 00:06:56,707
How was your

161
00:06:56,709 --> 00:06:58,509
big date with
the Snuffy Tuffkin?

162
00:06:58,511 --> 00:06:59,826
The Sniffy Napkin?

163
00:06:59,828 --> 00:07:03,380
The Slouchy Foreskin?

164
00:07:03,382 --> 00:07:04,664
Lily tie-tie.

165
00:07:04,666 --> 00:07:08,268
It was good... ish.

166
00:07:09,170 --> 00:07:11,838
Look, there's Orion's Belt.

167
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,106
Oh.

168
00:07:13,108 --> 00:07:15,225
<i>Why does holding hands feel</i>
<i>this weird?</i>

169
00:07:15,227 --> 00:07:17,394
<i>Should our fingers</i>
<i>not intertwine?</i>

170
00:07:17,396 --> 00:07:20,647
<i>What's causing that</i>
<i>pinching feeling?</i>

171
00:07:20,649 --> 00:07:22,849
<i>I'll just cup her hand.</i>

172
00:07:22,851 --> 00:07:25,185
<i>There. That's...</i>

173
00:07:25,187 --> 00:07:27,204
<i>not great.</i>

174
00:07:30,825 --> 00:07:34,027
<i>Her hair's up my nose.</i>

175
00:07:34,029 --> 00:07:37,548
<i>Her shoulder's jabbing</i>
<i>into my windpipe.</i>

176
00:07:37,550 --> 00:07:39,299
<i>Maybe if we reposition.</i>

177
00:07:44,472 --> 00:07:45,872
I have to say something.

178
00:07:45,874 --> 00:07:47,391
She must be feeling it, too.

179
00:07:47,393 --> 00:07:49,209
This feels so right.

180
00:07:49,211 --> 00:07:52,012
We fit like two puzzle pieces.

181
00:07:52,014 --> 00:07:53,230
Yeah.

182
00:07:53,232 --> 00:07:56,600
Ted, I know you've waited
ten years for this girl,

183
00:07:56,602 --> 00:07:58,718
but some things
just aren't meant to be.

184
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,854
Not so fast.
At the end of the night,

185
00:08:00,856 --> 00:08:03,657
when I leaned in and somehow
accidentally kissed

186
00:08:03,659 --> 00:08:06,660
her open eyeball, there was a
slight flicker of something

187
00:08:06,662 --> 00:08:09,746
I might even call chemistry...

188
00:08:09,748 --> 00:08:11,248
adjacent.

189
00:08:12,116 --> 00:08:13,400
Thank you.

190
00:08:13,402 --> 00:08:14,918
Wait.

191
00:08:16,287 --> 00:08:18,005
Where is my cash?

192
00:08:18,007 --> 00:08:19,590
Oh, yeah,

193
00:08:19,592 --> 00:08:22,292
I did a little exchange
for ya, Canucklehead.

194
00:08:22,294 --> 00:08:25,712
This Canadian dollar here
is called a "loonie."

195
00:08:25,714 --> 00:08:30,100
And this two-dollar coin?
A "toonie." True story.

196
00:08:30,102 --> 00:08:33,270
It's federal currency
and you people talk about it

197
00:08:33,272 --> 00:08:35,305
like it's a Hannah-
Barbera character.

198
00:08:35,307 --> 00:08:38,225
Not you people, Barney.

199
00:08:38,227 --> 00:08:39,726
Our people.

200
00:08:39,728 --> 00:08:42,195
<i>Even though my first date</i>
<i>with Naomi was</i>

201
00:08:42,197 --> 00:08:43,363
<i>a little awkward,</i>

202
00:08:43,365 --> 00:08:45,432
<i>our second date was</i>
<i>a lot awkward.</i>

203
00:08:45,434 --> 00:08:46,867
Mmm...!

204
00:08:46,869 --> 00:08:49,903
<i>This is the worst</i>
<i>kissing of all time!</i>

205
00:08:49,905 --> 00:08:50,937
Mmm...

206
00:08:50,939 --> 00:08:52,739
<i>How could she possibly</i>
<i>be into this?</i>

207
00:08:53,626 --> 00:08:55,075
<i>She sounds like</i>
<i>those cows in</i>

208
00:08:55,077 --> 00:08:56,443
<i>Temple Grandin's</i>
<i>hug machines.</i>

209
00:08:56,445 --> 00:08:58,712
Do you want to listen
to some music?

210
00:08:58,714 --> 00:08:59,563
Uh-huh!

211
00:09:06,171 --> 00:09:07,754
Ted, this is our song.

212
00:09:07,756 --> 00:09:09,890
Let's make love to this song.

213
00:09:11,476 --> 00:09:13,677
? Chickety China,
the Chinese chicken ?

214
00:09:13,679 --> 00:09:15,295
? Have a drumstick
and your brain stops tickin' ?

215
00:09:15,297 --> 00:09:16,763
Yeah, I just gotta run
to the bathroom.

216
00:09:16,765 --> 00:09:18,765
? <i>X-Files</i> with no lights on,
we're <i>dans la maison.</i> ?

217
00:09:22,437 --> 00:09:23,437
Hey, doofus!

218
00:09:23,439 --> 00:09:25,439
It's me:
you at age 15.

219
00:09:25,441 --> 00:09:26,657
And we made a deal

220
00:09:26,659 --> 00:09:29,993
we would always boink any chick
that wants to boink us!

221
00:09:29,995 --> 00:09:31,244
Yes, she's beautiful,

222
00:09:31,246 --> 00:09:33,580
it's just there's
no connection there.

223
00:09:33,582 --> 00:09:35,148
I don't feel intimate with her.

224
00:09:35,150 --> 00:09:36,950
"Intimate"? Let me remind you
of some things

225
00:09:36,952 --> 00:09:39,286
you did feel "intimate" with
when you were 15:

226
00:09:39,288 --> 00:09:40,420
a catcher's mitt,

227
00:09:40,422 --> 00:09:42,989
an oven mitt,
a glass of warm water,

228
00:09:42,991 --> 00:09:46,627
a half-open hide-a-bed sofa,
a top-loading VCR!

229
00:09:46,629 --> 00:09:47,878
It's not gonna happen!

230
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:50,514
Come on!

231
00:09:50,516 --> 00:09:53,684
It'll take, like, 30 seconds!

232
00:09:55,169 --> 00:09:56,520
Naomi, listen...

233
00:09:56,522 --> 00:09:59,523
Shh...

234
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:03,694
You like that, Ted?

235
00:10:03,696 --> 00:10:04,861
Hmm.

236
00:10:04,863 --> 00:10:08,398
Do you ike it
when I caress your hair?

237
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:11,851
Your hair is
so nice to caress.

238
00:10:11,853 --> 00:10:13,954
<i>Why is she saying that word?</i>

239
00:10:13,956 --> 00:10:16,406
I like to caress your hair.

240
00:10:16,408 --> 00:10:20,243
<i>There it is again! "Caress!"</i>
<i>Who says that?</i>

241
00:10:20,245 --> 00:10:23,246
Caress.

242
00:10:24,832 --> 00:10:26,866
The thing is,
I like her, okay?

243
00:10:26,868 --> 00:10:28,969
I really, really like her.

244
00:10:28,971 --> 00:10:32,139
I just don't seem to like
anything she says or does.

245
00:10:32,974 --> 00:10:34,891
I have to break up
with her, don't I?

246
00:10:34,893 --> 00:10:35,942
Yes!

247
00:10:35,944 --> 00:10:37,978
After you sleep with her, yes!

248
00:10:39,046 --> 00:10:40,714
Marshall, I've been thinking
about what you said.

249
00:10:40,716 --> 00:10:43,567
You're right, we shouldn't
move to the suburbs.

250
00:10:43,569 --> 00:10:46,603
Let's not make any huge life
decisions right now.

251
00:10:46,605 --> 00:10:48,522
Is this because you tried
to make waffles

252
00:10:48,524 --> 00:10:49,723
with the laptop this morning?

253
00:10:49,725 --> 00:10:53,160
Anyway, I'm gonna call
a real estate broker

254
00:10:53,162 --> 00:10:54,945
to come look at the
house tomorrow.

255
00:10:54,947 --> 00:10:56,546
Oh, by the way,

256
00:10:56,548 --> 00:10:58,699
I ordered those Minnesota
Vikings drapes.

257
00:10:58,701 --> 00:11:01,918
You're right, they're totally
gonna class up our apartment.

258
00:11:04,722 --> 00:11:07,641
Okay, yes. It's wrong
to bang a drunk chick.

259
00:11:07,643 --> 00:11:10,744
But you're an idiot if you don't
get, like, a little something.

260
00:11:13,264 --> 00:11:14,264
Yo, Canada.

261
00:11:14,266 --> 00:11:16,383
What? Dammit!

262
00:11:16,385 --> 00:11:18,251
Ha, you answer to "Canada" now.

263
00:11:20,071 --> 00:11:21,354
I'll make you a deal.

264
00:11:21,356 --> 00:11:22,723
You wear this costume

265
00:11:22,725 --> 00:11:24,641
to the Halloween party
tomorrow night,

266
00:11:24,643 --> 00:11:26,810
I'll drop it forever.

267
00:11:29,697 --> 00:11:31,732
You can't be serious.

268
00:11:31,734 --> 00:11:34,651
Oh, I am as serious
as a poutine shortage

269
00:11:34,653 --> 00:11:37,237
in Chicoutimi during
a curling bonspiel.

270
00:11:37,239 --> 00:11:40,940
I don't know what
any of those words mean.

271
00:11:40,942 --> 00:11:43,126
Yes. You do.

272
00:11:47,783 --> 00:11:50,133
Oh, that must be the broker.
Marshall, will you get it?

273
00:11:50,135 --> 00:11:52,302
Sure. Of course.

274
00:11:52,304 --> 00:11:55,222
Trick or treat!

275
00:11:55,224 --> 00:11:57,624
Oh, my gosh. How cute!

276
00:11:57,626 --> 00:11:59,392
I'm sorry, we don't
have any candy.

277
00:11:59,394 --> 00:12:01,178
Um, we forgot about
trick-or-treaters.

278
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:02,395
We don't get any where we live.

279
00:12:02,397 --> 00:12:05,315
Yup. Only get this
kind of cuteness

280
00:12:05,317 --> 00:12:06,650
in the suburbs.

281
00:12:08,469 --> 00:12:13,490
Oh. Look at how sweet and
happy and unarmed they all are!

282
00:12:13,492 --> 00:12:16,660
Are you using adorable
little children in costumes

283
00:12:16,662 --> 00:12:17,828
to manipulate me?
- Bye!

284
00:12:17,830 --> 00:12:19,979
I mean, did you even call
a real estate broker?

285
00:12:19,981 --> 00:12:21,865
No.

286
00:12:21,867 --> 00:12:23,950
I've got Pregnancy Brain
like a fiddle

287
00:12:23,952 --> 00:12:27,420
and I've been playing
you like a fox.

288
00:12:29,624 --> 00:12:35,145
? Oh, Canada... ?

289
00:12:35,147 --> 00:12:40,550
? Our home and native land... ?

290
00:12:42,521 --> 00:12:45,522
<i>I knew it would be tough</i>
<i>to break up with Naomi.</i>

291
00:12:45,524 --> 00:12:48,225
<i>But when it's just not there,</i>
<i>you can't force it.</i>

292
00:12:51,946 --> 00:12:53,480
Happy Halloween.

293
00:12:53,482 --> 00:12:56,983
<i>And just like that, I was</i>
<i>taken back ten years...</i>

294
00:12:56,985 --> 00:13:00,153
<i>to the hopeful kid in</i>
<i>the hanging chad costume,</i>

295
00:13:00,155 --> 00:13:03,022
<i>falling head over heels</i>
<i>for the Slutty Pumpkin.</i>

296
00:13:03,024 --> 00:13:05,909
I made you something.

297
00:13:08,629 --> 00:13:11,381
- Oh.
- Your costume from that first night.

298
00:13:11,383 --> 00:13:14,084
Although you do realize
that even ten years ago,

299
00:13:14,086 --> 00:13:16,920
the hanging chad reference
was like almost a year old.

300
00:13:16,922 --> 00:13:19,372
Wow...

301
00:13:19,374 --> 00:13:21,258
I can't believe you made this.

302
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:23,543
I can't believe you found me.

303
00:13:23,545 --> 00:13:26,847
<i>Stay strong, Teddy.</i>
<i>We can do this.</i>

304
00:13:26,849 --> 00:13:28,648
I...

305
00:13:28,650 --> 00:13:31,101
<i>"Have to break up with you,"</i>
<i>just say it.</i>

306
00:13:31,986 --> 00:13:33,353
Love...
<i>Wait, what?</i>

307
00:13:33,355 --> 00:13:34,721
<i>No, no, no, no, no, no, no!</i>

308
00:13:34,723 --> 00:13:36,823
<i>Say sunsets!</i>
<i>Pancakes! Anything!</i>

309
00:13:36,825 --> 00:13:38,057
<i>Just don't say...</i>

310
00:13:38,059 --> 00:13:39,359
You.

311
00:13:39,361 --> 00:13:42,445
<i>No!</i>

312
00:13:46,444 --> 00:13:47,994
Barney? Where are you?

313
00:13:48,039 --> 00:13:49,906
You're moving slower
than John Diefenbaker

314
00:13:49,908 --> 00:13:52,575
climbing Mount Hungabee
on Boxing Day.

315
00:13:52,577 --> 00:13:54,877
Those are all real references
to our shared homeland.

316
00:13:54,879 --> 00:13:56,379
I'll be right there.

317
00:13:56,381 --> 00:14:00,550
Can't wait to see you in your
costume, Dudley Do-Right.

318
00:14:00,552 --> 00:14:02,468
? Living in America ?

319
00:14:02,470 --> 00:14:03,970
? Ow! ?

320
00:14:03,972 --> 00:14:05,805
? Eye to eye ?

321
00:14:05,807 --> 00:14:08,391
? Station to station ?

322
00:14:08,393 --> 00:14:11,644
? <i>Living in America</i> ?

323
00:14:11,646 --> 00:14:14,180
? Hand in hand ?

324
00:14:14,182 --> 00:14:16,716
? Across the nation ?

325
00:14:16,718 --> 00:14:20,586
? <i>Living in America</i> ?

326
00:14:20,588 --> 00:14:24,490
? Got to have a celebration ?

327
00:14:24,492 --> 00:14:27,827
? Rock my soul ?

328
00:14:27,829 --> 00:14:30,163
? Ow! ?

329
00:14:30,165 --> 00:14:32,448
If we move here, you're just
going to have that baby,

330
00:14:32,450 --> 00:14:34,200
and then you're going to hate me

331
00:14:34,202 --> 00:14:36,536
for letting you do this.
I'm going to love it here.

332
00:14:36,538 --> 00:14:40,123
Oh, we'd have so much
room in the suburbs.

333
00:14:40,125 --> 00:14:44,326
You can get that pinball
machine you've always wanted.

334
00:14:44,328 --> 00:14:47,380
You can put it
anywhere you want.

335
00:14:47,382 --> 00:14:50,099
Stop it. You don't
know what you're saying.

336
00:14:50,101 --> 00:14:51,551
Anywhere.

337
00:14:51,553 --> 00:14:55,054
Upstairs, downstairs...

338
00:14:55,056 --> 00:14:57,356
you can stick it in the back.

339
00:14:58,559 --> 00:15:01,894
Lily, I want to be
inside this house so bad.

340
00:15:01,896 --> 00:15:04,831
USA! USA!

341
00:15:04,833 --> 00:15:06,132
USA!

342
00:15:06,134 --> 00:15:07,533
Come on!

343
00:15:07,535 --> 00:15:09,869
Okay, so rather than
wearing a Mountie costume

344
00:15:09,871 --> 00:15:11,320
and end this forever,

345
00:15:11,322 --> 00:15:13,189
you show up shirtless
to an outdoor party?

346
00:15:13,191 --> 00:15:14,540
It's practically November.

347
00:15:14,542 --> 00:15:16,959
No biggie. I ain't cold.

348
00:15:16,961 --> 00:15:18,961
Huh. Interesting.

349
00:15:18,963 --> 00:15:20,463
It's fascinating.

350
00:15:20,465 --> 00:15:23,499
Almost as if your body was
accustomed to low temperatures

351
00:15:23,501 --> 00:15:26,385
after generations of adapting.

352
00:15:26,387 --> 00:15:27,970
Canada.

353
00:15:27,972 --> 00:15:29,055
No.

354
00:15:29,057 --> 00:15:31,874
Guys, hey. Robin,
Barney, this is Naomi.

355
00:15:31,876 --> 00:15:33,259
- Hey.
- Hey.

356
00:15:33,261 --> 00:15:35,928
Nice to meet you guys.

357
00:15:35,930 --> 00:15:39,265
I'm gonna go make some Tootsie
Rolls. It's a drink I invented.

358
00:15:39,267 --> 00:15:40,233
There's a song and dance

359
00:15:40,235 --> 00:15:41,768
that goes along with it,
but I have to

360
00:15:41,770 --> 00:15:43,102
drink three of them
before I can do it.

361
00:15:45,222 --> 00:15:46,873
Oh.
Okay. You go.

362
00:15:46,875 --> 00:15:48,691
This way.

363
00:15:50,110 --> 00:15:53,229
Sounds delicious.
In theory.

364
00:15:53,231 --> 00:15:55,564
But you never know
until you taste it.

365
00:15:55,566 --> 00:15:59,902
Ted... have you tasted
her Tootsie Roll?

366
00:15:59,904 --> 00:16:00,920
Of course not.

367
00:16:00,922 --> 00:16:03,172
- Ow.
- Wait. Have you?

368
00:16:05,293 --> 00:16:07,760
You had sex with someone you
have zero feelings for!

369
00:16:07,762 --> 00:16:09,078
U-S-A!

370
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:10,129
U-S...

371
00:16:10,131 --> 00:16:12,265
Stop it.

372
00:16:12,267 --> 00:16:14,100
Just no part of it felt right.

373
00:16:14,102 --> 00:16:16,385
At first there was too much
eye contact, then not enough.

374
00:16:16,387 --> 00:16:18,420
Where do you look during sex?

375
00:16:18,422 --> 00:16:21,057
Um, into the hidden camera
at future me watching it.

376
00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:24,310
Okay. Wait. How does

377
00:16:24,312 --> 00:16:26,562
saying "I want to break up
with you" lead into sex?

378
00:16:26,564 --> 00:16:29,866
I didn't say "I want to
break up with you," exactly.

379
00:16:29,868 --> 00:16:31,484
What did you say, exactly?

380
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:34,737
"I love you."

381
00:16:34,739 --> 00:16:37,273
Classic Schmosby.

382
00:16:38,343 --> 00:16:42,829
Marshall, this house
wants you so bad.

383
00:16:42,831 --> 00:16:45,248
"Mow my lawn.

384
00:16:45,250 --> 00:16:46,883
"Rake my leaves.

385
00:16:46,885 --> 00:16:48,751
Winterize my pipes""

386
00:16:48,753 --> 00:16:49,919
Yes!

387
00:16:49,921 --> 00:16:51,587
Yes! I'm coming...

388
00:16:51,589 --> 00:16:53,289
to terms with this decision!

389
00:16:53,291 --> 00:16:55,224
Oh!

390
00:16:55,226 --> 00:16:57,093
Trick or treat!

391
00:16:57,095 --> 00:16:57,810
Yay!

392
00:16:57,812 --> 00:17:00,012
Okay.

393
00:17:00,814 --> 00:17:03,099
Oh.

394
00:17:03,101 --> 00:17:04,433
Happy Halloween.

395
00:17:06,687 --> 00:17:09,355
- Lily.
- Yeah?

396
00:17:09,357 --> 00:17:10,823
You just gave
those children

397
00:17:10,825 --> 00:17:13,976
a stapler,
a pair of sharp scissors,

398
00:17:13,978 --> 00:17:16,279
and a pretty decent
Pinot Noir.

399
00:17:16,281 --> 00:17:17,663
I did?

400
00:17:18,582 --> 00:17:20,533
Oh, my God.

401
00:17:20,535 --> 00:17:24,370
I'm going to miss
that stapler so much.

402
00:17:26,790 --> 00:17:29,926
I'm not doing
so great, am I?

403
00:17:29,928 --> 00:17:31,961
Maybe not.

404
00:17:33,714 --> 00:17:36,799
We shouldn't make any
huge life decisions

405
00:17:36,801 --> 00:17:38,434
right now, should we?

406
00:17:38,436 --> 00:17:43,272
Hey, look, I love you and
I-I love the idea of raising

407
00:17:43,274 --> 00:17:45,358
our kids with a lawn
and a white picket fence,

408
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:47,509
but we have our whole lives
to decide when

409
00:17:47,511 --> 00:17:49,812
and if we want
to do that.

410
00:17:49,814 --> 00:17:52,014
Do what?

411
00:17:52,016 --> 00:17:54,567
Let's get you home.

412
00:17:59,957 --> 00:18:01,624
Ooh.

413
00:18:01,626 --> 00:18:04,193
That's for the stapler!

414
00:18:04,195 --> 00:18:06,362
I hate the suburbs.

415
00:18:09,918 --> 00:18:10,917
Naomi...

416
00:18:10,919 --> 00:18:12,534
We have to
end this.

417
00:18:12,536 --> 00:18:13,535
W-- huh?

418
00:18:13,537 --> 00:18:15,171
I'm sorry, Tootsie Rolls make me

419
00:18:15,173 --> 00:18:17,556
really honest.

420
00:18:17,558 --> 00:18:22,395
Ted... I know
you're super into me.

421
00:18:23,347 --> 00:18:24,847
But we are terrible together.

422
00:18:24,849 --> 00:18:26,515
Wait, what?

423
00:18:26,517 --> 00:18:30,853
I've been trying, saying things
felt good that didn't just to...

424
00:18:32,439 --> 00:18:35,324
I thought saying it was good
would make it feel good, but...

425
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:39,829
...it always felt off.

426
00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:45,334
<i>Why won't he stop</i>
<i>sniffing my hair?</i>

427
00:18:45,336 --> 00:18:46,836
<i>And what's up</i>
<i>with the hand holding?</i>

428
00:18:46,838 --> 00:18:50,506
<i>It's like he's trying</i>
<i>to win a thumb war.</i>

429
00:18:50,508 --> 00:18:53,742
Ted, this is our song.

430
00:18:53,744 --> 00:18:56,429
<i>Oh, no, he thinks</i>
<i>I'm actually into this song.</i>

431
00:18:56,431 --> 00:18:58,547
<i>Does he not get sarcasm?</i>

432
00:18:58,549 --> 00:19:01,517
Let's make love to this song.

433
00:19:01,519 --> 00:19:02,852
<i>I'll just be even more</i>
<i>ridiculous</i>

434
00:19:02,854 --> 00:19:04,854
<i>to make it clear it's a joke.</i>

435
00:19:04,856 --> 00:19:06,772
? Chickety-China,
the Chinese chicken... ?

436
00:19:06,774 --> 00:19:08,024
I...

437
00:19:08,026 --> 00:19:10,192
<i>Uh-oh, where you going</i>
<i>with this, buddy?</i>

438
00:19:10,194 --> 00:19:11,310
...love...

439
00:19:11,312 --> 00:19:12,594
<i>Nope, too soon.</i>

440
00:19:12,596 --> 00:19:14,981
<i>Say basset hounds,</i>
<i>Pretzel Crisps, anything but...</i>

441
00:19:14,983 --> 00:19:16,281
...you.

442
00:19:16,306 --> 00:19:18,148
<i>Oh, God, just kiss him</i>
<i>before he proposes.</i>

443
00:19:21,538 --> 00:19:23,205
Ted, I've been looking
for the Hot Hanging Chad

444
00:19:23,207 --> 00:19:25,825
for the last nine Halloweens.

445
00:19:25,827 --> 00:19:27,660
I've waded
through a sweaty parade

446
00:19:27,662 --> 00:19:30,046
of Big Lebowskis, Harry Potters,

447
00:19:30,048 --> 00:19:32,048
Antoine Dodsons,
and that jackass

448
00:19:32,050 --> 00:19:33,883
who always dresses as laundry.

449
00:19:33,885 --> 00:19:35,251
Oh, I hate that guy.

450
00:19:35,253 --> 00:19:37,970
That's why,
once I finally found you...

451
00:19:38,839 --> 00:19:42,141
...it was hard to let you go.

452
00:19:43,343 --> 00:19:44,977
Good-bye, Ted.

453
00:19:48,965 --> 00:19:51,734
Let's just not touch ever again.

454
00:19:51,736 --> 00:19:52,685
Probably a good idea, yeah.

455
00:19:52,687 --> 00:19:54,737
Okay.

456
00:19:54,739 --> 00:19:57,406
<i>Kids, after spending a decade</i>
<i>dreaming of the wrong girl,</i>

457
00:19:57,408 --> 00:20:00,326
<i>I wanted more than ever</i>
<i>for the next woman I met</i>

458
00:20:00,328 --> 00:20:02,695
<i>to be the real thing.</i>

459
00:20:04,781 --> 00:20:08,868
Yeah, I don't know, Barney,
she doesn't seem like my type.

460
00:20:08,870 --> 00:20:11,253
I will kill you.

461
00:20:11,255 --> 00:20:12,588
I'll see
what I can do.

462
00:20:34,644 --> 00:20:37,362
Oh, hey there, I'm
Barney, how are you?

463
00:20:37,364 --> 00:20:40,666
No, <i>I'm</i> Barney.

464
00:20:42,869 --> 00:20:44,002
Whoa.

465
00:20:44,004 --> 00:20:45,954
You pack quite a wallop there.

466
00:20:45,956 --> 00:20:47,989
Hope you didn't
hurt your hand.

467
00:20:47,991 --> 00:20:50,825
Why are you so nice?

468
00:20:52,329 --> 00:20:54,329
Oh, sorry about my
thick noodle there.

469
00:20:54,331 --> 00:20:56,882
How about we split the
cost of the vase, eh?

470
00:20:56,884 --> 00:20:59,551
Holy Zamboni.

471
00:20:59,553 --> 00:21:01,436
Wow, you really put your
weight behind that one.

472
00:21:01,438 --> 00:21:02,938
That was a
really good one.

473
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:04,773
Oh, heavens to Gretzky, that
was a real Chiclet rattler.
