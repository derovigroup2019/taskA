1
00:00:02,012 --> 00:00:04,880
<i>Kids, 2012 started out</i>
<i>kind of crazy.</i>

2
00:00:05,544 --> 00:00:07,478
Barney met a girl named Quinn,

3
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:09,463
<i>Kevin unproposed to Robin,</i>

4
00:00:09,465 --> 00:00:10,731
<i>I told Robin...</i>

5
00:00:10,733 --> 00:00:12,099
I love you, Robin.

6
00:00:12,101 --> 00:00:12,933
<i>When I asked if she</i>

7
00:00:12,935 --> 00:00:14,852
<i>loved me back, she said...</i>

8
00:00:14,854 --> 00:00:16,570
No.

9
00:00:16,572 --> 00:00:17,721
<i>Marshall told Robin...</i>

10
00:00:17,723 --> 00:00:19,690
You got to move out.

11
00:00:19,692 --> 00:00:22,810
<i>And Robin did.</i>

12
00:00:29,918 --> 00:00:32,803
I can't even open
her bedroom door anymore.

13
00:00:33,538 --> 00:00:35,506
Why do I have
to be so sensitive?

14
00:00:35,508 --> 00:00:37,791
I don't know, bro.

15
00:00:37,793 --> 00:00:39,009
Look at me and that Quinn chick.

16
00:00:39,011 --> 00:00:40,294
You don't hear me
prattling on

17
00:00:40,296 --> 00:00:42,513
about how beautiful
her smile is,

18
00:00:42,515 --> 00:00:46,550
how her hair is like a waterfall
of honey-colored silk,

19
00:00:46,552 --> 00:00:49,970
how her eyes are like
a warm South Sea

20
00:00:49,972 --> 00:00:53,256
kissed by the fire
and gold of sunrise.

21
00:00:53,258 --> 00:00:55,258
I don't even remember
what she looks like.

22
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:57,260
Dude, you obviously like her.
Can't you read

23
00:00:57,262 --> 00:00:58,445
between the lines, Ted?

24
00:00:58,447 --> 00:00:59,780
I obviously like her.

25
00:00:59,782 --> 00:01:01,365
How did this happen to me?

26
00:01:01,367 --> 00:01:04,601
When did I become such
a gooey romantic?

27
00:01:06,070 --> 00:01:07,488
Look, I think it's healthy

28
00:01:07,490 --> 00:01:10,240
that you have real feelings
for a woman

29
00:01:10,242 --> 00:01:12,242
instead of just seeing her
as an object.

30
00:01:12,244 --> 00:01:13,577
Switch?

31
00:01:13,579 --> 00:01:14,294
Sure.

32
00:01:15,714 --> 00:01:16,747
But why Quinn?

33
00:01:16,749 --> 00:01:18,281
I mean, you spent
one night with her,

34
00:01:18,283 --> 00:01:19,449
and she was kind of mean.

35
00:01:19,451 --> 00:01:20,834
We just connected.

36
00:01:20,836 --> 00:01:23,787
Emotionally, intellectually,
spiritually.

37
00:01:23,789 --> 00:01:24,755
So, mind-blowing sex?

38
00:01:24,757 --> 00:01:27,558
Mind-blowing sex!

39
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:31,228
For an hour afterwards,
I couldn't uncross my eyes.

40
00:01:31,230 --> 00:01:33,981
Which was awesome, because
when I went back for seconds,

41
00:01:33,983 --> 00:01:36,316
it was like having
a three-way with twins.

42
00:01:36,318 --> 00:01:38,402
So... call her.

43
00:01:38,404 --> 00:01:40,637
I would if I knew how
to get in touch with her,

44
00:01:40,639 --> 00:01:42,573
but I can't,
and it's driving me crazy.

45
00:01:42,575 --> 00:01:43,774
Everywhere I look,
I see her.

46
00:01:43,776 --> 00:01:45,192
I see her walking on the street;

47
00:01:45,194 --> 00:01:47,811
I see her shopping in the store;

48
00:01:47,813 --> 00:01:49,830
I see her dancing on that pole.

49
00:01:49,832 --> 00:01:51,915
I see her dancing
on that pole, too.

50
00:01:51,917 --> 00:01:54,251
Oh, my God, that's Quinn.

51
00:01:54,253 --> 00:01:57,437
Gentlemen,
give it up for Karma.

I really appreciate
you guys taking me in.

55
00:02:13,055 --> 00:02:14,104
I mean,

56
00:02:14,106 --> 00:02:15,606
I'm homeless,

57
00:02:15,608 --> 00:02:17,858
things between me and Ted
are still kind of weird.

58
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:20,143
So, it's nice
to be around friends.

59
00:02:20,145 --> 00:02:21,979
Well, stay as long
as you want, sweetie.

60
00:02:21,981 --> 00:02:23,179
Oh, thank you.

61
00:02:23,181 --> 00:02:24,531
Mm.

62
00:02:24,533 --> 00:02:26,700
Now, I got you a journal.

63
00:02:26,702 --> 00:02:27,951
I know this sounds lame,

64
00:02:27,953 --> 00:02:30,621
but it really helps work
through stuff to write about it.

65
00:02:30,623 --> 00:02:31,955
Oh.

66
00:02:31,957 --> 00:02:34,691

00:02:37,863 --> 00:02:39,663
that one's mine.

70
00:02:40,748 --> 00:02:42,631
You are going to have
so much fun here.

71
00:02:42,635 --> 00:02:45,469
Oh, guys, please, do not feel like you
have to keep me entertained.

72
00:02:45,804 --> 00:02:47,704
Well, you shouldn't have come
to East Meadow, Long Island,

73
00:02:47,706 --> 00:02:49,506
Robin, if you didn't want
to be entertained.

74
00:02:49,508 --> 00:02:51,808
Really? I didn't think
there was a ton to do here.

75
00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:54,144
Oh, apparently, someone
hasn't heard

76
00:02:54,146 --> 00:02:56,263
of the Uniondale
Miniatures Museum.

77
00:02:56,265 --> 00:02:58,482
You'll come for
the 19th century thimble art,

78
00:02:58,484 --> 00:03:02,069
but you'll stay for the
Dutch masters on bottle caps.

79
00:03:02,071 --> 00:03:02,936
Plus,

80
00:03:02,938 --> 00:03:04,104
you'll be bowling
with two

81
00:03:04,106 --> 00:03:07,441
charter members of the
East Meadow Alley Cats.

82
00:03:08,109 --> 00:03:09,159
"We're a hot dog eating team

83
00:03:09,161 --> 00:03:10,861
with a bowling problem."

84
00:03:10,863 --> 00:03:11,862
Shirley

85
00:03:11,864 --> 00:03:13,396
came up with that one.

86
00:03:13,398 --> 00:03:14,448
Great bowler, Shirley.

87
00:03:14,450 --> 00:03:16,450
She hit 280 the other day.

88
00:03:16,452 --> 00:03:20,053
Unfortunately,
that was on her bathroom scale.

89
00:03:20,838 --> 00:03:22,122
<i>When Robin moved out,</i>

90
00:03:22,124 --> 00:03:23,907
<i>there was a hole in my life</i>

91
00:03:23,909 --> 00:03:25,792
<i>in the shape</i>
<i>of an empty bedroom.</i>

92
00:03:25,794 --> 00:03:28,411
<i>I filled it with a new hobby.</i>

93
00:03:31,583 --> 00:03:33,300
What are you doing
in my old room?

94
00:03:33,302 --> 00:03:35,135
This room being empty
was bumming me out,

95
00:03:35,137 --> 00:03:36,853
so I decided
to do something healthy

96
00:03:36,855 --> 00:03:38,305
that would take my mind off you.

97
00:03:38,307 --> 00:03:39,756
Well, nothing says healthy

98
00:03:39,758 --> 00:03:41,892
like smoking 40 pounds
of pork loin

99
00:03:41,894 --> 00:03:43,226
in an unventilated room

100
00:03:43,228 --> 00:03:45,729
while having an imaginary
conversation with your ex.

101
00:03:45,731 --> 00:03:48,031
Just for that,
you're not getting any.

102
00:03:48,033 --> 00:03:49,232
I'm not getting any?

103
00:03:49,234 --> 00:03:51,101
You're the one smoking
your own meat.

104
00:03:51,103 --> 00:03:52,152
Oh!

105
00:03:53,989 --> 00:03:56,707
What am I gonna do
about this Quinn thing?

106
00:03:56,709 --> 00:03:58,108
I want to ask her out again,

107
00:03:58,110 --> 00:04:00,210
but I don't know how I feel
about her being a stripper.

108
00:04:00,212 --> 00:04:02,829
Why would you have
an issue with that?

109
00:04:02,831 --> 00:04:05,465
I mean, you've dated convicted
felons, arms dealers...

110
00:04:05,467 --> 00:04:07,050
pageant moms.

111
00:04:07,052 --> 00:04:11,004
Hey, Quinn is someone I might
want to get serious with,

112
00:04:11,006 --> 00:04:15,475
not just pretend to be a judge

113
00:04:15,477 --> 00:04:18,729
Tiffany's mom <i>really</i>
wanted that tiara.

114
00:04:18,731 --> 00:04:21,798
In a city of eight
million people,

115
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:24,901
you happened to walk into
the club where she works?

116
00:04:24,903 --> 00:04:25,936
Maybe it's destiny.

117
00:04:25,938 --> 00:04:28,322
No, Destiny strips
at The Melon Patch.

118
00:04:28,324 --> 00:04:30,924
They're people, Ted;
try to keep them straight.

119
00:04:31,659 --> 00:04:33,593
Wait a minute.

120
00:04:33,595 --> 00:04:36,780
What if this is destiny?

121
00:04:36,782 --> 00:04:37,664
I just said...

122
00:04:37,666 --> 00:04:39,282
What if the universe

123
00:04:39,284 --> 00:04:42,336
is throwing us in each other's
path for some reason?

124
00:04:42,338 --> 00:04:43,537
More or less exactly what I...

125
00:04:43,539 --> 00:04:46,322
I don't care what you say,
this is destiny!

126
00:04:46,324 --> 00:04:47,374
Damn it, Ted!

127
00:04:47,376 --> 00:04:49,626
Why can't you ever root
for love?

128
00:04:55,516 --> 00:04:56,499
Hey.

129
00:04:56,501 --> 00:04:58,135
Hey.

130
00:04:58,137 --> 00:04:59,269
Quinn...

131
00:04:59,271 --> 00:05:00,437
No, listen,

132
00:05:00,439 --> 00:05:02,406
in here I'm Karma, okay?

133
00:05:02,408 --> 00:05:03,506
Got it.

134
00:05:03,508 --> 00:05:04,808
Uh, look, Karma,

135
00:05:04,810 --> 00:05:05,809
I swear

136
00:05:05,811 --> 00:05:07,994
I never say crap
like this, but...

137
00:05:07,996 --> 00:05:09,196
I think maybe
the universe

138
00:05:09,198 --> 00:05:11,581
is telling us something.

139
00:05:11,583 --> 00:05:13,183
You want to go out again?

140
00:05:13,185 --> 00:05:15,569
I'm sorry,
I don't date customers.

141
00:05:15,571 --> 00:05:16,870
What about destiny?

142
00:05:16,872 --> 00:05:18,789
I heard she's
over at The Melon Patch now.

143
00:05:18,791 --> 00:05:22,492
No, I mean like fate telling us
that we're supposed to be...

144
00:05:22,494 --> 00:05:23,660
Oh, listen, Barney,

145
00:05:23,662 --> 00:05:25,912
my manager is really
giving me the stink eye.

146
00:05:25,914 --> 00:05:27,798
I have to get back to work.

147
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:28,832
Okay, wait, wait.

148
00:05:28,834 --> 00:05:30,550
What if I pay for a dance?

149
00:05:30,552 --> 00:05:31,501
That way,

150
00:05:31,503 --> 00:05:32,586
your manager's happy,

151
00:05:32,588 --> 00:05:33,920
and then I can to tell you

152
00:05:33,922 --> 00:05:35,705
why you should go on
another date with me.

153
00:05:35,707 --> 00:05:38,475
I guess there's
no reason why not.

154
00:05:38,477 --> 00:05:41,211
Okay, first off,
we have a lot in common.

155
00:05:41,213 --> 00:05:42,596
For example,

156
00:05:42,598 --> 00:05:44,714
both of our jobs
are largely financed

157
00:05:44,716 --> 00:05:47,901
by drunk Asian businessmen.

158
00:05:47,903 --> 00:05:49,770
<i>Dear Diary.</i>

159
00:05:49,772 --> 00:05:51,772

160
00:05:51,774 --> 00:05:54,107
<i>which the natives have dubbed</i>
<i>"Long Island,"</i>

161
00:05:54,109 --> 00:05:55,575
<i>perhaps referencing</i>

162
00:05:55,577 --> 00:05:58,412
<i>how each hour here feels</i>
<i>like it may never end.</i>

163
00:05:58,414 --> 00:06:00,697
<i>So far, they have welcomed me</i>

164
00:06:00,699 --> 00:06:04,734
<i>and given me a rare glimpse</i>
<i>into their bizarre way of life.</i>

165
00:06:04,736 --> 00:06:07,904
<i>By "entertainment," they mean</i>
<i>table shuffle board,</i>

<i>macram? classes, and other</i>

<i>to calm down drug addicts</i>
<i>and the criminally insane.</i>

169
00:06:17,266 --> 00:06:21,034
<i>A preliterate society,</i>

<i>of the food they offer,</i>

<i>and dessert</i>
<i>has fireworks in it.</i>

174
00:06:31,980 --> 00:06:35,115

00:06:42,774 --> 00:06:44,407
<i>the night.</i>

179
00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:47,527
<i>Also Diary, I think writing</i>
<i>in you is stupid,</i>

180
00:06:47,529 --> 00:06:48,795
but you were a gift from Lily,

181
00:06:48,797 --> 00:06:50,330
<i>and she's watching</i>
<i>me right now.</i>

182
00:06:50,332 --> 00:06:53,884
Guys, um, I don't want
to overstay my welcome,

183
00:06:53,886 --> 00:06:56,619
and Patrice said that she would
take me off your hands.

184
00:06:56,621 --> 00:06:59,639
So, do you have
a train schedule or...

185
00:06:59,641 --> 00:07:00,891
Oh, yeah,

186
00:07:00,893 --> 00:07:01,892
um, but-but

187
00:07:01,894 --> 00:07:04,728
there's a-a problem
with the train.

188
00:07:04,730 --> 00:07:06,429
Big, big problem.

189
00:07:06,431 --> 00:07:07,330
There was a...

190
00:07:07,332 --> 00:07:09,599
Strike.
A lightning strike.

191
00:07:09,601 --> 00:07:12,802
That hit one of the picketers
who was on strike.

192
00:07:12,804 --> 00:07:14,938
During a thunderstorm.

193
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:18,942
Plus,

194
00:07:18,944 --> 00:07:22,078
Yeah, she probably doesn't
even want you there.

195
00:07:26,083 --> 00:07:27,501
You guys are being weird.

196
00:07:28,035 --> 00:07:30,670
Oh!
Oh!

197
00:07:30,672 --> 00:07:33,323
Oh, my God, Robin,
I am so sorry.

198
00:07:33,325 --> 00:07:34,925
I'll throw these in the wash.

199
00:07:34,927 --> 00:07:37,844
They'll be dry
and folded in the morning.

200
00:07:37,846 --> 00:07:39,329
Or the weekend.

201
00:07:39,331 --> 00:07:40,997
And we can talk
about you leaving then.

202
00:07:40,999 --> 00:07:42,349
Or never.

203
00:07:42,351 --> 00:07:44,851
Wait, Lily, why don't...

204
00:07:44,853 --> 00:07:46,853
It's 8:45,
time to hit the hay.

205
00:07:46,855 --> 00:07:48,939
Good night!

206
00:07:54,812 --> 00:07:56,646
So Ted, what healthy,

207
00:07:56,648 --> 00:07:59,182
not-at-all-crazy activity
are you up to now?

208
00:07:59,184 --> 00:08:02,852
I liked smoking meat,
but now I've got a new passion:

209
00:08:02,854 --> 00:08:04,454
wood.

210
00:08:04,456 --> 00:08:07,490
You hear these things that come
out of your mouth, right?

211
00:08:13,130 --> 00:08:15,198
So I went back to
the Lusty Leopard.

212
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:16,716
You know what, Barney?

213
00:08:16,718 --> 00:08:19,753
I know I said I have a rule
about not dating customers,

214
00:08:19,755 --> 00:08:23,657
but you may have
convinced me to...

215
00:08:23,659 --> 00:08:25,208
Oh.

216
00:08:25,210 --> 00:08:26,643
Song's over, I got to go.

217
00:08:26,645 --> 00:08:28,878
Wait, no, what?
Convinced you to what?

218
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:31,848
I'm sorry, but manager's
giving me the stink eye.

219
00:08:31,850 --> 00:08:34,150
Ugh, get a life, Manager.

220
00:08:35,186 --> 00:08:36,719
What were you saying?

221
00:08:36,721 --> 00:08:39,139
Well, I was going to say

222
00:08:39,141 --> 00:08:42,826
that I do find you
very... charming.

223
00:08:43,561 --> 00:08:45,362
And funny...

224
00:08:45,364 --> 00:08:46,813
and sexy.

225
00:08:46,815 --> 00:08:49,666
And exciting and smart.

226
00:08:49,668 --> 00:08:52,002
You so get me.

227
00:08:52,004 --> 00:08:53,703
You know what, Barney?

228
00:08:53,705 --> 00:08:56,206
I have never done
this before,

229
00:08:56,208 --> 00:08:59,909
but there's just
something about you.

230
00:08:59,911 --> 00:09:01,595
So I guess my answer is...

231
00:09:01,597 --> 00:09:03,129
Oh.

232
00:09:03,131 --> 00:09:04,130
The song's over.

233
00:09:04,132 --> 00:09:05,849
Well, just finish the thought!

234
00:09:05,851 --> 00:09:07,384
But the manager.
God,

235
00:09:07,386 --> 00:09:08,385
I hate manager.

236
00:09:10,322 --> 00:09:12,689
There. Your answer is...

237
00:09:12,691 --> 00:09:15,108
Maybe if we knew each other
a little better.

238
00:09:16,094 --> 00:09:17,110
Tell me about yourself.

239
00:09:17,112 --> 00:09:19,112
Well, um, what can I tell you?

240
00:09:19,114 --> 00:09:20,113
I'm, um...

241
00:09:20,115 --> 00:09:22,282
charming and funny

242
00:09:22,284 --> 00:09:24,901
and sexy and...

243
00:09:24,903 --> 00:09:28,455
exciting and smart.

244
00:09:28,457 --> 00:09:30,457
Well, how can a girl
say no to that?

245
00:09:30,459 --> 00:09:32,826
How about we...

246
00:09:32,828 --> 00:09:34,794
go out on...

247
00:09:34,796 --> 00:09:38,581
aaaaaaaaa...

248
00:09:38,583 --> 00:09:40,417
aaaaaa...

249
00:09:40,419 --> 00:09:42,135
Ugh, these songs are so short.

250
00:09:45,072 --> 00:09:48,591
Uh, how much exactly
did you give Quinn?

251
00:09:48,593 --> 00:09:50,060
Eight, nine hundred bucks,

252
00:09:50,062 --> 00:09:52,896
plus whatever
my Rolex is worth.

253
00:09:52,898 --> 00:09:54,064
Whoa.

254
00:09:54,066 --> 00:09:55,098
I know.

255
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:58,134
Ted, I think I'm in love.

256
00:10:05,786 --> 00:10:07,404
Quinn is totally playing you.

257
00:10:07,406 --> 00:10:08,371
What?

258
00:10:08,373 --> 00:10:09,856
That's ridiculous.

259
00:10:09,858 --> 00:10:11,091
If she were playing me,

260
00:10:11,093 --> 00:10:13,076
why would she agree
to go on a date with me?

261
00:10:13,078 --> 00:10:15,495
You're different than
the rest of these schlubs.

262
00:10:15,497 --> 00:10:18,998
This one time only,
I'm going to break my rule.

263
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,864
Let's go out tomorrow night.

264
00:10:20,889 --> 00:10:22,089
Sweet!

265
00:10:22,147 --> 00:10:25,509
Oh, shoot!
I have to work tomorrow. Ugh!

266
00:10:25,996 --> 00:10:28,027
Hey! Brainstorm!

267
00:10:28,052 --> 00:10:29,797
What if we just have
our date here,

268
00:10:30,489 --> 00:10:31,861
It's a date.

269
00:10:32,312 --> 00:10:36,163
It's not a date, if you go into a
strip club and paying for lap dances.

270
00:10:36,164 --> 00:10:39,072
If it's not a date, why'd she
say, every fifth day was free?

271
00:10:39,104 --> 00:10:40,887
Because that's
the Lusty Leopard's policy

272
00:10:40,889 --> 00:10:43,556
on Friday nights, and I'm so mad
at you that I know that!

273
00:10:43,558 --> 00:10:47,243
<i>Dear Diary.</i>

274
00:10:47,245 --> 00:10:49,162
<i>It is day six on this island,</i>

275
00:10:49,164 --> 00:10:52,882
<i>and I begin to fear I am</i>
<i>more captive than guest...</i>

276
00:10:54,786 --> 00:10:56,169
Morning, sweetie.

277
00:10:56,171 --> 00:10:58,171
Up for croquet?

278
00:10:59,206 --> 00:11:01,574
Hey, uh, Lil, are you done

279
00:11:01,576 --> 00:11:03,710
washing my clothes yet?
Because I...

280
00:11:03,712 --> 00:11:04,928
Oh, I am so sorry.

281
00:11:04,930 --> 00:11:07,013
Your clothes accidentally
wound up in the bag

282
00:11:07,015 --> 00:11:09,065
I donated to Goodwill.

283
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:11,250
You gave away my clothes?

284
00:11:11,252 --> 00:11:14,220
They were a bit fancy
for East Meadow.

285
00:11:14,222 --> 00:11:16,389
People were staring.

286
00:11:16,391 --> 00:11:19,976
Besides, we have
an extra Snugget.

287
00:11:21,095 --> 00:11:22,645
Try it.

288
00:11:23,931 --> 00:11:25,815
Try it, Robin.

289
00:11:27,735 --> 00:11:29,736
<i>They're trying to make me</i>
<i>one of them, Diary.</i>

290
00:11:29,738 --> 00:11:32,655
<i>And I begin to fear...</i>

291
00:11:32,657 --> 00:11:35,041
<i>I may like it!</i>

292
00:11:37,628 --> 00:11:39,629
I can't believe we're
at a strip club,

293
00:11:39,631 --> 00:11:41,931
and the biggest boob
in here is you.

294
00:11:41,933 --> 00:11:44,300
It's a real date, Ted.

295
00:11:44,302 --> 00:11:47,303
And clearly you haven't
seen the DeSalvo twins.

296
00:11:47,305 --> 00:11:48,555
She's right over there.

297
00:11:48,557 --> 00:11:50,640
Barney...
Yowza!

298
00:11:50,642 --> 00:11:53,292
You are not on a date.

299
00:11:53,294 --> 00:11:54,611
Okay, look, prove it.

300
00:11:54,613 --> 00:11:57,180
Prove that she's not just
taking advantage of you.

301
00:11:57,182 --> 00:11:59,599
Get her to go out with
you anywhere but here.

302
00:11:59,601 --> 00:12:00,850
Fine!

303
00:12:00,852 --> 00:12:03,319
Hey, sexy! You want a dance?

304
00:12:03,321 --> 00:12:04,654
Yeah!

305
00:12:04,656 --> 00:12:06,156
Uh, one thing, though.

306
00:12:06,158 --> 00:12:08,491
Um, you'd be okay
with us having a date

307
00:12:08,493 --> 00:12:10,309
somewhere besides here,
wouldn't you?

308
00:12:10,311 --> 00:12:12,862
I was hoping you would ask that.

309
00:12:12,864 --> 00:12:15,582
I'm sorry it's
so expensive in here,

310
00:12:15,584 --> 00:12:17,700
but it's nice and private, huh?

311
00:12:17,702 --> 00:12:19,169
Absolutely. And romantic!

312
00:12:19,171 --> 00:12:21,287
It's our first getaway
as a couple!

313
00:12:22,656 --> 00:12:23,990
It's become clear to me, Diary,

314
00:12:23,992 --> 00:12:25,875
<i>that I must attempt</i>
<i>a dramatic escape.</i>

315
00:12:25,877 --> 00:12:29,095
<i>I will fake a stomach ache</i>
<i>during dinner.</i>

316
00:12:29,097 --> 00:12:31,297
<i>Then, after Marshall and Lily</i>
<i>leave for bingo night,</i>

317
00:12:31,299 --> 00:12:33,433
<i>I will sneak out the back.</i>

318
00:12:33,435 --> 00:12:36,302
<i>I'll swipe Shirley's Rascal</i>
<i>and drive to the train station.</i>

319
00:12:36,304 --> 00:12:38,337
<i>Shirley's 42, by the way,</i>
<i>and rides a Rascal.</i>

320
00:12:38,339 --> 00:12:42,192
<i>I swear, it's the second half</i>
<i>of</i> Wall-E out here.

321
00:12:44,345 --> 00:12:46,029
Bingo...

322
00:12:47,081 --> 00:12:49,866
was canceled.

323
00:12:53,571 --> 00:12:56,506
Hey, sexy, you want a dance?

324
00:12:56,508 --> 00:12:58,875
No,
I'm not a customer.

325
00:12:58,877 --> 00:13:00,359
My girlfriend works here.

326
00:13:00,361 --> 00:13:03,162
She's right over...

327
00:13:03,164 --> 00:13:05,632
This one time only,
I'm gonna break my rule.

328
00:13:05,634 --> 00:13:07,083
Let's go out tomorrow night!

329
00:13:07,085 --> 00:13:08,034
Sweet!

330
00:13:08,036 --> 00:13:09,319
Oh, shoot!

331
00:13:09,321 --> 00:13:12,438
I have to work tomorrow. Ugh!

332
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:13,673
Hey! Brainstorm!

333
00:13:13,675 --> 00:13:15,592
What if we just have
our date here,

334
00:13:15,594 --> 00:13:19,045
maybe in
the Champagne Room?

335
00:13:21,214 --> 00:13:23,750
That was our spot.

336
00:13:28,810 --> 00:13:30,427
Hey, gorgeous,
You want a dance?

337
00:13:31,429 --> 00:13:32,863
Is it a jig?

338
00:13:32,865 --> 00:13:34,965
'Cause if so, it's up.

339
00:13:35,633 --> 00:13:37,200
Sorry, I only had the last verse

340
00:13:37,202 --> 00:13:39,703
of "Hot For Teacher" to work
on that. What was that?

341
00:13:39,705 --> 00:13:43,606
You laid exactly the same line
on that guy that you did on me!

342
00:13:43,608 --> 00:13:44,624
Sweetie, that is just something

343
00:13:44,626 --> 00:13:47,294
I say to these
gullible losers here.

344
00:13:47,296 --> 00:13:48,912
They fall for it every time.

345
00:13:48,914 --> 00:13:52,716
Bunch of losers!

346
00:13:52,718 --> 00:13:54,718
Oh, gosh, manager again.

347
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:55,919
He's looking at me like,

348
00:13:55,921 --> 00:13:57,671
"Karma, why aren't you booking
more time

349
00:13:57,673 --> 00:13:58,838
in the Champagne Room?"

350
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:01,174
Well, we'll show him.

351
00:14:01,176 --> 00:14:03,793
No! You're playing me again!

352
00:14:03,795 --> 00:14:06,346
And you're not even trying hard!

353
00:14:06,348 --> 00:14:08,148
There's no manager there;
You're pointing at a fern!

354
00:14:09,984 --> 00:14:11,601
Ted was right.

355
00:14:11,603 --> 00:14:14,454
I bet he's home right now,
laughing at how dumb I am.

356
00:14:19,911 --> 00:14:22,612
Did I deserve this?
Absolutely.

357
00:14:22,614 --> 00:14:25,615
I have told
some outrageous lies.

358
00:14:25,617 --> 00:14:27,968
I have told women I was famous,

359
00:14:27,970 --> 00:14:29,336
a war hero,

360
00:14:29,338 --> 00:14:31,821
that sex with me would cure
their nearsightedness.

361
00:14:31,823 --> 00:14:33,456
Barney?!

362
00:14:35,343 --> 00:14:38,762
I probably deserved everything
you did to me and more.

363
00:14:38,764 --> 00:14:40,430
But I have been trying,

364
00:14:40,432 --> 00:14:43,416
and trying hard
to be a better person.

365
00:14:44,135 --> 00:14:45,185
Thanks for showing me

366
00:14:45,187 --> 00:14:46,736
I had it right before.

367
00:14:54,228 --> 00:14:58,064
Look, I'm sorry we made you feel
a little suffocated,

368
00:14:58,066 --> 00:15:01,451
but were you really
just gonna sneak away?

369
00:15:01,453 --> 00:15:04,371
Well, it's just...
I really miss the city.

370
00:15:04,373 --> 00:15:06,706
I know you guys love it here,
and that's fine,

371
00:15:06,708 --> 00:15:08,024
We don't love it here!

372
00:15:08,026 --> 00:15:08,691
What?

373
00:15:08,693 --> 00:15:09,859
Come on, Robin,

374
00:15:09,861 --> 00:15:11,878
what kind
of life is this?

375
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:13,463
Going to canasta tournaments

376
00:15:13,465 --> 00:15:15,165
and high school
field hockey playoffs?

377
00:15:15,167 --> 00:15:17,751
Oh, I think North Bellmore
can take state.

378
00:15:17,753 --> 00:15:19,753
With Sophie's ankle?
Doubtful.

379
00:15:19,755 --> 00:15:21,888
Okay, but if you two
are so unhappy,

380
00:15:21,890 --> 00:15:23,890
why don't you just move
back to Manhattan?

381
00:15:23,892 --> 00:15:26,593
Because the suburbs are
better for the baby.

382
00:15:26,595 --> 00:15:29,729
Who says? Who says any place
is better for the baby

383
00:15:29,731 --> 00:15:31,931
if you two are unhappy in it?

384
00:15:33,884 --> 00:15:36,386
No, no,
we live here now.

385
00:15:37,054 --> 00:15:38,772
And, you know,
this place

386
00:15:38,774 --> 00:15:40,240
wouldn't seem
so bad if...

387
00:15:40,242 --> 00:15:43,126
we got one of our friends
to move out here.

388
00:15:43,778 --> 00:15:45,561
Oh, guys...

389
00:15:45,563 --> 00:15:48,531
Oh...

390
00:15:48,533 --> 00:15:51,267
I would rather set myself
on fire.

391
00:15:52,586 --> 00:15:55,571
<i>The next morning,</i>
<i>Barney learned that even in</i>

392
00:15:55,573 --> 00:15:58,875
a city of eight million people,
<i>there's no escaping Karma.</i>

393
00:16:06,084 --> 00:16:07,100
Oh.

394
00:16:07,102 --> 00:16:08,768
Oh, hey.

395
00:16:08,770 --> 00:16:11,554
Sorry, can't talk;
manager's watching.

396
00:16:13,474 --> 00:16:14,524
Look, I am sorry

397
00:16:14,526 --> 00:16:16,443
if I hurt your feelings;
it's a job.

398
00:16:16,445 --> 00:16:17,811
Yeah, well, at my job,

399
00:16:17,813 --> 00:16:19,729
we don't rip out
people's hearts for money.

400
00:16:19,731 --> 00:16:24,317
My company briefly backed
a lab in North Korea

401
00:16:24,319 --> 00:16:26,403
which did, but we sold it!

402
00:16:26,405 --> 00:16:28,321
You know, I've worked
at that club for a year.

403
00:16:28,323 --> 00:16:29,706
You practically live there,

404
00:16:29,708 --> 00:16:31,658
and you didn't even recognize me
the night we went out.

405
00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:34,777
You can't pretend to be some
hurt little victim with me.

406
00:16:34,779 --> 00:16:35,829
I know you.

407
00:16:35,831 --> 00:16:37,047
Well, of course you do.

408
00:16:37,049 --> 00:16:38,614
I told you things
I don't tell anybody.

409
00:16:38,616 --> 00:16:39,799
I was honest with you.

410
00:16:39,801 --> 00:16:41,918
Yeah, because I believe you have
a gay black brother,

411
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:43,636
a friend lonely enough
to smoke his own meat

412
00:16:43,638 --> 00:16:45,472
and that your mom was a groupie
for Supertramp.

413
00:16:45,474 --> 00:16:48,508
They named
their band for her!

414
00:16:50,845 --> 00:16:52,628
You remembered all that?

415
00:16:52,630 --> 00:16:55,014
Well, yeah.
I mean,

416
00:16:55,016 --> 00:16:56,299
you're more interesting
than the lyrics

417
00:16:56,301 --> 00:16:58,935
to "Pour Some Sugar On Me"
for the 8,000th time.

418
00:17:00,938 --> 00:17:02,522
You know, it's funny.

419
00:17:02,524 --> 00:17:05,692
Almost every woman
I've ever met was wrong

420
00:17:05,694 --> 00:17:07,310
to give me a chance.

421
00:17:07,312 --> 00:17:10,463
You're the first woman
who's wrong not to.

422
00:17:13,817 --> 00:17:15,118
Large black coffee...

423
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:18,154
and whatever he's having.

424
00:17:18,156 --> 00:17:19,756
It's on me.

425
00:17:20,657 --> 00:17:23,009
The same.

426
00:17:23,011 --> 00:17:24,427
Thank you.

427
00:17:24,429 --> 00:17:26,846
You're welcome.

428
00:17:26,848 --> 00:17:29,849
1,700 more of these
and we're even.

429
00:17:29,851 --> 00:17:31,834
Uh, the song just ended.

430
00:17:31,836 --> 00:17:33,669
That mean you got
to get going?

431
00:17:33,671 --> 00:17:35,972
No.

432
00:17:35,974 --> 00:17:38,024
Do you have time
to sit with me?

433
00:17:38,026 --> 00:17:40,794
I don't know.
You're wearing my watch.

434
00:17:44,031 --> 00:17:46,733
Pottery.
Now you're making pottery.

435
00:17:46,735 --> 00:17:48,618
I needed a new vase...

436
00:17:48,620 --> 00:17:50,520
and some plates.

437
00:17:50,522 --> 00:17:51,788
And bowls.

438
00:17:51,790 --> 00:17:54,207
The china cabinet I built had
some design flaws.

439
00:17:54,209 --> 00:17:56,960
Why don't you just turn
this into a guest room?

440
00:17:56,962 --> 00:17:58,328
A guest room?

441
00:17:58,330 --> 00:18:00,363
You mean
a room ready and waiting

442
00:18:00,365 --> 00:18:01,697
for someone who isn't there?

443
00:18:01,699 --> 00:18:04,918
A room devoted to reminding me
that I'm still alone?

444
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:08,338
Yeah, I don't need that.

445
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:13,176
Ted, no matter how many things
you put in this room...

446
00:18:13,178 --> 00:18:15,445
I'll still be here.

447
00:18:27,057 --> 00:18:27,723
Hey.

448
00:18:27,725 --> 00:18:29,909
Hey!

449
00:18:30,394 --> 00:18:31,778
Come on in.

450
00:18:31,780 --> 00:18:33,746
Thanks.

451
00:18:34,849 --> 00:18:37,283
Oh, um, thanks for packing up
the rest of my stuff.

452
00:18:37,285 --> 00:18:39,619
No problem. Uh, you
want some coffee?

453
00:18:39,621 --> 00:18:41,955
Uh, sure. Yeah?
Yeah.

454
00:18:43,290 --> 00:18:44,407
So, how are things?

455
00:18:44,409 --> 00:18:46,376
Good! You?
Great!

456
00:18:46,378 --> 00:18:48,361
You know, I actually
made this mug.

457
00:18:48,363 --> 00:18:49,929
Oh, yeah? Oh!
Yeah. Oh!

458
00:18:49,931 --> 00:18:52,599
Yeah, sorry, coffee's
a little strong.

459
00:18:53,717 --> 00:18:56,269
How was your stay
with Marshall and Lily?

460
00:18:56,271 --> 00:18:58,304
Uh... a little weird.

461
00:18:58,306 --> 00:19:00,440
They're not loving Long Island.

462
00:19:00,442 --> 00:19:01,608
Oh.

463
00:19:01,610 --> 00:19:03,142
I think deep down, they realize

464
00:19:03,144 --> 00:19:05,111
it just... isn't a good fit.

465
00:19:05,113 --> 00:19:08,698
It's hard to admit that
sometimes.

466
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:10,567
Sure is.

467
00:19:10,569 --> 00:19:13,870
But I guess it's better
to face it and move on

468
00:19:13,872 --> 00:19:18,575
than try to force something that
just isn't meant to be, right?

469
00:19:18,577 --> 00:19:20,293
I think so.

470
00:19:20,295 --> 00:19:21,644
Yeah.

471
00:19:22,379 --> 00:19:23,546
So, what do you think

472
00:19:23,548 --> 00:19:25,098
you're gonna do
with my old room?

473
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:26,616
Haven't really thought about it.

474
00:19:26,618 --> 00:19:28,284
Oh!

475
00:19:34,275 --> 00:19:36,509
Who needs Manhattan?

476
00:19:36,511 --> 00:19:37,844
Yeah.

477
00:19:39,964 --> 00:19:41,964
Hmm, it's Ted.
He wants to know

478
00:19:41,966 --> 00:19:43,983
if we want to hang
out in the city.

479
00:19:43,985 --> 00:19:45,852
The next train leaves
in nine minutes.

480
00:20:03,203 --> 00:20:06,956
<i>Dear Lily and Marshall,</i>
<i>I don't know if you know this,</i>

481
00:20:06,958 --> 00:20:09,959
<i>but I never took</i>
<i>your names off the lease.</i>

482
00:20:09,961 --> 00:20:13,663
<i>Well, today</i>
<i>I took my name off it.</i>

483
00:20:13,665 --> 00:20:16,666
<i>The apartment is now yours.</i>

484
00:20:16,668 --> 00:20:19,502
<i>And I think I finally figured</i>
<i>out the best thing</i>

485
00:20:19,504 --> 00:20:21,471
<i>to do with Robin's old room.</i>

486
00:20:30,314 --> 00:20:33,983
<i>See, for me, this place has</i>
<i>begun to feel a little haunted.</i>

487
00:20:33,985 --> 00:20:36,569
<i>At first, I thought</i>
<i>it was haunted by Robin,</i>

488
00:20:36,571 --> 00:20:39,439
<i>but now I think</i>
<i>it was haunted by me.</i>

489
00:20:39,441 --> 00:20:44,494
<i>Well, no ghost is at peace</i>
<i>until it finally moves on.</i>

490
00:20:45,713 --> 00:20:47,714
<i>I need a change.</i>

491
00:20:47,716 --> 00:20:49,749
<i>And I think you do, too.</i>

492
00:20:49,751 --> 00:20:52,418
<i>This apartment needs</i>
<i>some new life.</i>

493
00:20:52,420 --> 00:20:56,756
<i>So, please, make our old home</i>
<i>your new home.</i>

494
00:20:56,758 --> 00:20:59,275
<i>It is now ghost-free.</i>

495
00:20:59,277 --> 00:21:00,893
<i>Love, Ted.</i>
