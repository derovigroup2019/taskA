1
00:00:00,721 --> 00:00:03,766
Oh, God, guys, I'm
still really hungover.

2
00:00:03,770 --> 00:00:05,136
Did I really
ruin a wedding?

3
00:00:05,138 --> 00:00:07,505
No, you didn't ruin
a wedding.

4
00:00:07,507 --> 00:00:08,907
Just the reception.

5
00:00:08,909 --> 00:00:10,842
And the bar mitzvah next door.

6
00:00:10,844 --> 00:00:12,527
And my dress.

7
00:00:12,529 --> 00:00:14,779
And your dress. You put on
a dress at one point.

8
00:00:14,781 --> 00:00:17,115
Okay, you know what,
that's it.

9
00:00:17,117 --> 00:00:19,784
I'm about to be a dad,
and I want to be

10
00:00:19,786 --> 00:00:22,436
the kind of man that my
child can look up to.

11
00:00:22,438 --> 00:00:24,906
So, sweeping declaration--

12
00:00:24,908 --> 00:00:29,210
I am never getting drunk again
as long as I live.

13
00:00:29,212 --> 00:00:31,278
I'm serious.

14
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:33,765
<i>Kids, it's not that</i>
<i>your Uncle Marshall</i>

15
00:00:33,767 --> 00:00:35,066
<i>had a drinking problem.</i>

16
00:00:35,068 --> 00:00:37,185
But whenever he made a sweeping
<i>declaration like that,</i>

17
00:00:37,187 --> 00:00:39,020
<i>you pretty much knew...</i>

18
00:00:40,622 --> 00:00:41,889
I did it again.

19
00:00:41,891 --> 00:00:44,175
<i>But I'm getting ahead</i>
<i>of myself.</i>

20
00:00:45,394 --> 00:00:47,345
What happened
to your leg?

21
00:00:47,347 --> 00:00:48,813
Oh, nothing.

22
00:00:48,815 --> 00:00:50,515
I'm meeting Nora
for coffee.

23
00:00:50,517 --> 00:00:52,934
She's still mad at me, so
I need some sympathy points.

24
00:00:52,936 --> 00:00:54,301
She likes musicals,
so I'm going

25
00:00:54,303 --> 00:00:55,803
to tell her I fell off the stage

26
00:00:55,805 --> 00:00:57,522
during a performance
of <i>Man of La Mancha.</i>

27
00:00:57,524 --> 00:00:58,639
What do you think?

28
00:00:58,641 --> 00:01:00,274
Lose the cast.

29
00:01:00,276 --> 00:01:02,910
A one-man show-- I like it!

30
00:01:02,912 --> 00:01:05,113
Just so we're clear--

31
00:01:05,115 --> 00:01:08,333
this woman is mad at you
because you lied to her.

32
00:01:08,335 --> 00:01:11,119
So your solution is to pretend
you broke your leg?

33
00:01:11,121 --> 00:01:13,204
You're right.

34
00:01:13,206 --> 00:01:15,373
A neck brace.
Thanks, Lil.

35
00:01:15,375 --> 00:01:17,675
Man, I wish I'd have talked
to you sooner.

36
00:01:17,677 --> 00:01:19,310
I've been practicing
with these crutches all day

37
00:01:19,312 --> 00:01:21,346
and whoever left them
in my lobby

38
00:01:21,348 --> 00:01:22,463
probably really
needs 'em.

39
00:01:22,465 --> 00:01:24,665
Well, uh, I have
some good news.

40
00:01:24,667 --> 00:01:28,052
As you all know, I recently
decided to get back out there

41
00:01:28,054 --> 00:01:30,955
and start dating again.
And, uh, well...

42
00:01:34,610 --> 00:01:36,627
Is this you?

43
00:01:36,629 --> 00:01:39,731
Uh, yeah. Hi.

44
00:01:39,733 --> 00:01:40,865
I'm Ted.

45
00:01:40,867 --> 00:01:42,133
- Hi.
- Hi.

46
00:01:42,135 --> 00:01:44,285
That's great, Ted.

47
00:01:44,287 --> 00:01:46,187
Yeah. Yeah, it was a moment
of pure destiny.

48
00:01:46,189 --> 00:01:48,656
The kind you just
can't manufacture.

49
00:01:48,658 --> 00:01:50,691
Or so I thought.

50
00:01:53,662 --> 00:01:56,697
Oh, no.
How did I get on there?

51
00:01:56,699 --> 00:01:58,649
Hi. Ted Mosby.

52
00:01:59,501 --> 00:02:00,868
Guilty.

53
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:02,670
Hi. Ted Mosby.

54
00:02:02,672 --> 00:02:04,422
That is embarrassing.

55
00:02:04,424 --> 00:02:08,643
I should be on the cover of
<i>Egg On My Face</i> magazine.

56
00:02:08,645 --> 00:02:09,844
But I'm not.

57
00:02:09,846 --> 00:02:11,979
I'm on the cover of this one.

58
00:02:11,981 --> 00:02:14,132
Hi. Ted Mosby.

59
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:16,150
16 moments of pure destiny

60
00:02:16,152 --> 00:02:18,853
in one day,
and of those 16,

61
00:02:18,855 --> 00:02:20,938
ten were single.

62
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:24,108
Of those ten,
seven liked what they saw.

63
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:25,760
Of those seven,

64
00:02:25,762 --> 00:02:27,728
four were women.

65
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:30,081
Of those four,

66
00:02:30,083 --> 00:02:31,365
two gave me their real number.

67
00:02:31,367 --> 00:02:34,168
And I have a date
with both of them.

68
00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:35,953
Okay.

69
00:02:37,706 --> 00:02:39,006
Guys,

70
00:02:39,008 --> 00:02:40,641
it's Garrison Cootes.

71
00:02:40,643 --> 00:02:42,593
<i>Kids, Garrison Cootes</i>
<i>was a senior partner</i>

72
00:02:42,595 --> 00:02:44,245
<i>at Honeywell & Cootes.</i>

73
00:02:44,247 --> 00:02:45,797
<i>One of the biggest</i>
<i>environmental law firms</i>

74
00:02:45,799 --> 00:02:47,231
<i>in America.</i>

75
00:02:47,233 --> 00:02:49,300
<i>Marshall would have given</i>
<i>anything to work there.</i>

76
00:02:49,302 --> 00:02:51,636
If I don't get this job,
I might end up working

77
00:02:51,638 --> 00:02:52,854
at, like, a Taco Bell somewhere.

78
00:02:52,856 --> 00:02:54,355
And nobody wants that.

79
00:02:54,357 --> 00:02:57,041
Or maybe you guys want that,
because you'll get free tacos,

80
00:02:57,043 --> 00:02:58,392
'cause your my peeps.

81
00:02:58,394 --> 00:03:01,813
But right now I need
all of you to calm down!

82
00:03:03,099 --> 00:03:05,533
Hello.

83
00:03:05,535 --> 00:03:07,201
Marshall, this is
Garrison Cootes.

84
00:03:07,203 --> 00:03:09,036
Sorry I didn't get back
to you sooner,

85
00:03:09,038 --> 00:03:11,239
but I've just been swamped.

86
00:03:12,575 --> 00:03:15,276
Which is funny,
'cause I'm literally

87
00:03:15,278 --> 00:03:17,078
standing in a swamp.

88
00:03:18,915 --> 00:03:22,083
Anyway, I'm just out here,
I'm just collecting some samples

89
00:03:22,085 --> 00:03:24,285
for this pollution case
we're working on.

90
00:03:24,287 --> 00:03:26,254
I love the work you guys do.
That's a croc...

91
00:03:26,256 --> 00:03:27,306
No, I mean it.

92
00:03:27,331 --> 00:03:29,768
No, no, there's a crocodile
about five feet away from me.

93
00:03:29,893 --> 00:03:31,309
So I'm just going to ignore

94
00:03:31,311 --> 00:03:33,561
the hot urine filling
my waders as we speak,

95
00:03:33,563 --> 00:03:35,963
and tell you that
we're very interested.

96
00:03:35,965 --> 00:03:36,964
He's interested.

97
00:03:36,966 --> 00:03:38,649
Obviously we have
to do some sort

98
00:03:38,651 --> 00:03:40,935
of credit check, you know,
a criminal record

99
00:03:40,937 --> 00:03:43,571
and Google search, but as long
as nothing unseemly turns up,

100
00:03:43,573 --> 00:03:44,939
you're good to go, man.

101
00:03:44,941 --> 00:03:46,858
That is fantastic, Mr. Cootes!

102
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:48,242
Well, I gotta run.

103
00:03:49,913 --> 00:03:51,445
This is so funny,

104
00:03:51,447 --> 00:03:55,249
because, actually, I physically
have to run now.

105
00:03:55,251 --> 00:03:58,499
- Croc saw you?
- He's advancing, yeah.

109

<i>Thankfully, without</i>

110
00:04:16,573 --> 00:04:19,607
Hey, Nora, thanks
for meeting me here.

111
00:04:19,609 --> 00:04:20,758
What happened to your neck?

112
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:23,177
My wha...? Oh, it's nothing.

113
00:04:23,179 --> 00:04:26,513
I was performing in
a one-man show of <i>Fiddler.</i>

114
00:04:26,515 --> 00:04:28,282
There was this roof.

115
00:04:28,284 --> 00:04:30,501
Wow, that one has
fantastic ta-tas.

116
00:04:30,503 --> 00:04:31,652
What, where?

117
00:04:31,654 --> 00:04:32,870
Oh... Oh, damn it.

118
00:04:32,872 --> 00:04:34,005
Ta-ta.

119
00:04:34,007 --> 00:04:36,190
Wait, Nora, wait...
No, look, please don't.

120
00:04:36,192 --> 00:04:37,191
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

121
00:04:37,193 --> 00:04:38,593
What is the matter with you?

122
00:04:38,595 --> 00:04:40,628
What kind of person
needs to lie like that.

123
00:04:40,630 --> 00:04:43,364
A person who really,
really likes you.

124
00:04:43,366 --> 00:04:45,633
And suspects,
probably accurately,

125
00:04:45,635 --> 00:04:47,218
that you're way
out of his league,

126
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:49,470
and so he feels the need to...

127
00:04:51,089 --> 00:04:52,673
I'm sorry, you were kidding

128
00:04:52,675 --> 00:04:54,058
about the fantastic
ta-tas, right?

129
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:55,198
'Cause I'm looking around
and I do not see 'em...

130
00:04:58,264 --> 00:05:00,064
I just had two
back-to-back dates.

131
00:05:00,066 --> 00:05:02,733
That's right,
two lovely ladies,

132
00:05:02,735 --> 00:05:06,737
four large cappuccinos,
and... one sec.

133
00:05:07,941 --> 00:05:10,908
And I don't know which
date was more awesome.

134
00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:12,577
Let's meet the girls.

135
00:05:12,579 --> 00:05:14,862
<i>Jessica is a Rhodes scholar.</i>

136
00:05:14,864 --> 00:05:16,397
<i>She's traveled</i>
<i>all over the world.</i>

137
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:19,066
<i>Speaks four languages,</i>
<i>is a concert pianist.</i>

138
00:05:19,068 --> 00:05:22,853
<i>And Claire reached</i>
<i>for the check.</i>

139
00:05:22,855 --> 00:05:23,971
So I don't know.

140
00:05:23,973 --> 00:05:25,306
It's a squeaker.

141
00:05:25,308 --> 00:05:26,574
I mean, both
of these girls

142
00:05:26,576 --> 00:05:29,427
have the potential to be
something really special.

143
00:05:29,429 --> 00:05:31,381
They both move
on to the next round.

144
00:05:31,399 --> 00:05:32,364
Wait a minute.

145
00:05:32,465 --> 00:05:34,382
You're going to date
two girls at once?

146
00:05:34,384 --> 00:05:36,133
Don't you think you should
just choose one

147
00:05:36,135 --> 00:05:37,268
before it gets serious?

148
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:38,352
Define serious.

149
00:05:38,354 --> 00:05:40,087
Well, that's complicated.

150
00:05:40,089 --> 00:05:42,473
I guess you have to weigh
expectations,

151
00:05:42,475 --> 00:05:43,724
emotional investments...

152
00:05:43,726 --> 00:05:44,992
Third base.

153
00:05:44,994 --> 00:05:46,394
Seriously, third base.

154
00:05:46,396 --> 00:05:48,863
So I can go to second base with
both of these girls, no problem?

155
00:05:48,865 --> 00:05:51,082
Oh, honk away, my friend.
Yeah, honk away.

156
00:05:51,766 --> 00:05:53,317
Oh, no.

157
00:05:53,319 --> 00:05:55,519
Ever since Mr. Cootes mentioned
<i>the background check,</i>

158
00:05:55,521 --> 00:05:57,588
<i>Marshall had been</i>
<i>scouring the Internet.</i>

159
00:05:57,590 --> 00:06:00,041
<i>Most of what he found</i>
<i>was pretty harmless.</i>

160
00:06:00,043 --> 00:06:03,277
<i>In some cases,</i>
<i>really awesome, until...</i>

161
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:04,412
Not good.

162
00:06:04,414 --> 00:06:06,914
This-- this is not good.

163
00:06:07,782 --> 00:06:09,383
Thanks, Stacy.

164
00:06:09,385 --> 00:06:11,636
Wesleyan has a new cafeteria,

165
00:06:11,638 --> 00:06:13,587
thanks to the generous
endowment from--

166
00:06:13,589 --> 00:06:14,972
Oh, ho-ho!

167
00:06:14,974 --> 00:06:18,175
Did somebody say
generous endowment?

168
00:06:18,177 --> 00:06:24,815
I'm Marshall Eriksen, but you
can call me Beercules!

169
00:06:32,157 --> 00:06:34,641
Well, that could
be anybody.

170
00:06:38,306 --> 00:06:41,185
Oh, man, I forgot
about Beercules.

171
00:06:41,790 --> 00:06:43,623
Who made this
Web site anyway?

172
00:06:43,625 --> 00:06:46,068
- Pete Durkenson.
- Of course.

173
00:06:46,069 --> 00:06:49,213
Is that the guy who convinced
you to run across campus naked?

174
00:06:49,214 --> 00:06:51,131
I was pledging his frat,

175
00:06:51,133 --> 00:06:53,216
which I gave up on
after three days,

176
00:06:53,218 --> 00:06:55,702
because frats are stupid
and elitist

177
00:06:55,704 --> 00:06:58,204
and also I found out
he wasn't in a frat.

178
00:06:58,206 --> 00:07:00,256
Oh, my God.

179
00:07:00,258 --> 00:07:01,558
This is awesome.

180
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:04,277
I just got invited
to the Architects' Ball,

181
00:07:04,279 --> 00:07:07,730
the annual gala that honors
the city's greatest architects.

182
00:07:07,732 --> 00:07:10,900
Oh, no, you guys see
why this sucks, right?

183
00:07:10,902 --> 00:07:12,569
Because it's an annual gala

184
00:07:12,571 --> 00:07:14,154
honoring the city's
greatest architects?

185
00:07:14,156 --> 00:07:17,874
Robin, this is the social event
of the year.

186
00:07:17,876 --> 00:07:20,243
You take a girl
to the Architects' Ball,

187
00:07:20,245 --> 00:07:22,612
brother, you're going
to third base.

188
00:07:22,614 --> 00:07:23,913
Whichever girl

189
00:07:23,915 --> 00:07:25,415
I take as my date,

190
00:07:25,417 --> 00:07:28,334
she will be
Miss Ted Mosby's girlfriend

191
00:07:28,336 --> 00:07:29,903
by the end of the night.

192
00:07:31,038 --> 00:07:32,922
Okay, no more sitting
on the fence.

193
00:07:32,924 --> 00:07:35,091
Robin, get me my legal pad.

194
00:07:35,093 --> 00:07:37,093
It's pros and cons time!

195
00:07:38,563 --> 00:07:41,698
And kids, they really cheered.

196
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:43,983
Let me make one thing
very clear to you.

197
00:07:43,985 --> 00:07:46,953
I don't date guys who lie to me.

198
00:07:46,955 --> 00:07:49,155
Well, see, I did not
know that.

199
00:07:49,157 --> 00:07:50,306
My bad.

200
00:07:50,308 --> 00:07:52,275
So, from here on in,
no more lies.

201
00:07:52,277 --> 00:07:55,178
I will never lie
to you again.

202
00:07:56,013 --> 00:07:57,614
I'm serious. Ask me anything.

203
00:07:57,616 --> 00:08:00,049
Okay.

204
00:08:00,051 --> 00:08:01,117
Have you ever successfully

205
00:08:01,119 --> 00:08:03,503
gotten a woman in bed
by lying to her?

206
00:08:03,505 --> 00:08:06,122
Have I ever...

207
00:08:08,792 --> 00:08:12,712
If I'm being totally honest...

208
00:08:14,765 --> 00:08:16,216
Yes.

209
00:08:16,218 --> 00:08:18,134
More than once?

210
00:08:18,136 --> 00:08:20,470
More than once...

211
00:08:20,472 --> 00:08:22,555
Wow, that's...

212
00:08:24,526 --> 00:08:27,560
I guess if we're
splitting hairs,

213
00:08:27,562 --> 00:08:31,397
then, technically...
there was a plurality

214
00:08:31,399 --> 00:08:35,702
to the times I've lied to women
for sex having purposes.

215
00:08:35,704 --> 00:08:36,920
What were they?

216
00:08:36,922 --> 00:08:38,922
Nines and tens mostly.

217
00:08:38,924 --> 00:08:40,573
There was a four once.

218
00:08:40,575 --> 00:08:41,958
She was a slump buster.

219
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:45,578
But, Nora, after that, I had a
run that you would not believe.

220
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:48,047
Man, honesty feels good.

221
00:08:48,049 --> 00:08:49,732
What were the lies?

222
00:08:49,734 --> 00:08:52,335
You want me to tell you every
lie I've ever told a woman

223
00:08:52,337 --> 00:08:53,503
to get her into bed?

224
00:08:53,505 --> 00:08:56,222
A bed or any other place
you had sex with her.

225
00:08:56,224 --> 00:08:57,457
Oh, you're good.

226
00:08:58,627 --> 00:09:00,810
Pete, Pete. Hey.

227
00:09:00,812 --> 00:09:02,929
Beercules!

228
00:09:02,931 --> 00:09:04,213
Bring it in, dude.

229
00:09:04,215 --> 00:09:06,349
Hey, I've been
trying to call you,

230
00:09:06,351 --> 00:09:07,717
like, all night.

231
00:09:07,719 --> 00:09:08,985
Oh, my God, sorry.

232
00:09:08,987 --> 00:09:10,987
I would have answered,
but it is Tuesday night.

233
00:09:10,989 --> 00:09:11,821
It's Sunday.

234
00:09:11,823 --> 00:09:13,606
And you know what that means.

235
00:09:13,608 --> 00:09:15,692
"Edward Forty Hands."

236
00:09:15,694 --> 00:09:17,760
<i>Kids, "Edward Forty Hands"</i>

237
00:09:17,762 --> 00:09:20,230
is a game that involves taping
<i>two 40-ounce bottles</i>

238
00:09:20,232 --> 00:09:22,565
<i>of malt liquor to your hands.</i>

239
00:09:22,567 --> 00:09:24,300
<i>The object is to finish</i>
<i>both bottle--</i>

240
00:09:24,302 --> 00:09:26,202
<i>Oh, my God, why am</i>
<i>I telling you this?</i>

241
00:09:26,204 --> 00:09:27,370
<i>Let's move on.</i>

242
00:09:27,372 --> 00:09:30,906
Okay, you know that old video
of me streaking?

243
00:09:30,908 --> 00:09:33,075
I watch it every day.

244
00:09:33,077 --> 00:09:35,929
Well, I need you to take it down
off the Internet.

245
00:09:35,931 --> 00:09:37,347
Like, right now.

246
00:09:37,349 --> 00:09:39,081
There are two ways
that can happen.

247
00:09:39,083 --> 00:09:41,217
One, you can give me
$4 million,

248
00:09:41,219 --> 00:09:44,437
or... you can help me
go to the bathroom,

249
00:09:44,439 --> 00:09:45,939
because I... I can't...

250
00:09:45,941 --> 00:09:49,809
Yeah, those are two
non-negotiable no's.

251
00:09:49,811 --> 00:09:51,778
Well, I'm sorry we could not
do business together.

252
00:09:51,780 --> 00:09:53,062
But if you'll excuse me,

253
00:09:53,064 --> 00:09:55,448
I'm in the middle of a game
of "Edward Forty Hands,"

254
00:09:55,450 --> 00:09:57,533
and the competition is fierce.

255
00:09:57,535 --> 00:10:00,269
Who are you
playing with, anyway?

256
00:10:00,271 --> 00:10:03,439
Just myself.

257
00:10:03,441 --> 00:10:06,042
<i>Meanwhile, Barney continued</i>
<i>listing every lie</i>

258
00:10:06,044 --> 00:10:07,293
<i>he'd ever told to get laid.</i>

259
00:10:07,295 --> 00:10:09,729
There's no time to explain
how I got bit there.

260
00:10:09,731 --> 00:10:11,864
I just need someone
to suck the poison out.

261
00:10:11,866 --> 00:10:14,033
The surgeons gave me a new face,

262
00:10:14,035 --> 00:10:15,051
honey.

263
00:10:15,053 --> 00:10:16,686
Aren't you relieved I'm alive?

264
00:10:16,688 --> 00:10:19,422
<i>Me llamo David Beckham.</i>

265
00:10:19,424 --> 00:10:22,208
If I were
only casting <i>The White Swan</i>

266
00:10:22,210 --> 00:10:23,509
the role would be yours.

267
00:10:23,511 --> 00:10:25,712
No, I am a lesbian.

268
00:10:25,714 --> 00:10:28,615
This thing that I'm wearing
is just really lifelike.

269
00:10:28,617 --> 00:10:30,350
Okay, let's skip ahead.

270
00:10:30,352 --> 00:10:31,484
What's the worst one?

271
00:10:31,486 --> 00:10:32,769
The lowest of the low?

272
00:10:32,771 --> 00:10:34,187
The creme de la creepy?

273
00:10:34,189 --> 00:10:37,991
Uh... Oh, I once pulled
<i>The Soul Man.</i>

274
00:10:37,993 --> 00:10:41,327
There was this beautiful girl
who only dated black guys...

275
00:10:41,329 --> 00:10:45,131
Barnell!
Ooh, I knew it!

276
00:10:47,001 --> 00:10:49,335
I can't decide.

277
00:10:49,337 --> 00:10:50,837
They're both awesome.

278
00:10:50,839 --> 00:10:53,640
If only architects had
two balls, right, Ted?

279
00:10:53,642 --> 00:10:55,508
I got this.

280
00:10:55,510 --> 00:10:57,010
Ted, left or right?

281
00:10:57,012 --> 00:10:58,327
Yes, yes, great idea.

282
00:10:58,329 --> 00:10:59,962
Let the fates decide, huh?

283
00:10:59,964 --> 00:11:02,115
I will pick left.

284
00:11:02,117 --> 00:11:03,299
Just call one of 'em.

285
00:11:03,301 --> 00:11:04,300
Ugh!

286
00:11:04,302 --> 00:11:05,635
Ted, deep in your heart,

287
00:11:05,637 --> 00:11:07,937
you know that you
kind of like one

288
00:11:07,939 --> 00:11:08,805
more than the other.

289
00:11:08,807 --> 00:11:10,306
Trust me-- take the other.

290
00:11:10,308 --> 00:11:13,309
Um, maybe I haven't
this is...

291
00:11:13,311 --> 00:11:15,678
the Architects'
Ball, Robin.

292
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:16,779
It's a star-studded event.

293
00:11:16,781 --> 00:11:19,014
Okay, name one celebrity
who's gonna be there.

294
00:11:19,016 --> 00:11:20,349
Uh... Lenny Kravitz.

295
00:11:20,351 --> 00:11:21,801
Lenny Kravitz is gonna be there?

296
00:11:21,803 --> 00:11:23,236
Yeah.
He's there every year.

297
00:11:23,238 --> 00:11:24,454
And that guy's a rock star.

298
00:11:24,456 --> 00:11:27,707
You know, Ted,
I've been thinking--

299
00:11:27,709 --> 00:11:30,877
it's too soon to narrow it down
between these two girls.

300
00:11:30,879 --> 00:11:31,994
Just take a friend.

301
00:11:31,996 --> 00:11:34,831
Like I... I don't know,
maybe, uh, a friend

302
00:11:34,833 --> 00:11:38,000
who had a poster of
Lenny Kravitz on her wall,

303
00:11:38,002 --> 00:11:40,720
and may or may not
have, perhaps,

304
00:11:40,722 --> 00:11:43,656
dated that poster, on and off,
throughout high school.

305
00:11:44,725 --> 00:11:47,376
This pros and cons list
isn't cutting it.

306
00:11:48,979 --> 00:11:50,713
I need a color chart.

307
00:11:51,682 --> 00:11:52,932
Color chart! Color chart!

308
00:11:52,934 --> 00:11:56,335
<i>And, kids,</i>
<i>we all really chanted.</i>

309
00:11:56,337 --> 00:11:57,353
Pete, please.

310
00:11:57,355 --> 00:11:59,155
I'm unemployed.

311
00:11:59,157 --> 00:12:00,440
I have a huge mortgage.

312
00:12:00,442 --> 00:12:01,941
I have a baby on the way.

313
00:12:01,943 --> 00:12:04,694
And now, I'm about
to lose a job I really need

314
00:12:04,696 --> 00:12:06,579
because of a 15-year-old prank!

315
00:12:06,581 --> 00:12:08,114
Ugh! Do you hear yourself?

316
00:12:08,116 --> 00:12:09,582
Beercules, what happened?

317
00:12:09,584 --> 00:12:10,817
You're like a different person.

318
00:12:11,785 --> 00:12:13,669
The guy in that video
was awesome.

319
00:12:13,671 --> 00:12:16,255
He had potential.

320
00:12:16,257 --> 00:12:18,541
He could have been president of
the frat one day.

321
00:12:18,543 --> 00:12:20,209
There was no frat!

322
00:12:20,211 --> 00:12:21,377
Now he's just a bummer.

323
00:12:21,379 --> 00:12:23,579
It's not like I want
to be a bummer.

324
00:12:23,581 --> 00:12:26,099
I just... I have to be.

325
00:12:26,101 --> 00:12:27,583
I'm gonna be a dad.

326
00:12:27,585 --> 00:12:28,851
You'll have kids someday.

327
00:12:28,853 --> 00:12:29,969
You'll understand.

328
00:12:29,971 --> 00:12:32,588
Dude, I have four kids.

329
00:12:32,590 --> 00:12:35,758
Pete, please take
the video down.

330
00:12:36,777 --> 00:12:38,778
All right, Beercules,
I'll take the video down.

331
00:12:38,780 --> 00:12:40,229
If...

332
00:12:40,231 --> 00:12:43,316
you can best me in
a game of my own choosing.

333
00:12:43,318 --> 00:12:44,567
Oh, no...

334
00:12:44,569 --> 00:12:47,036
And I select the beautiful game,

335
00:12:47,038 --> 00:12:48,270
the sweet science...

336
00:12:48,272 --> 00:12:50,072
Pete, please,
I'm so hungover...

337
00:12:50,074 --> 00:12:51,157
...the sport of kings...

338
00:12:51,159 --> 00:12:53,126
I don't want to play
"Edward Forty Hands."

339
00:12:53,128 --> 00:12:54,276
I was gonna say darts--

340
00:12:54,278 --> 00:12:57,079
but "Edward Forty
Hands" it is!

341
00:12:57,081 --> 00:12:59,882
And that concludes all
the space-related lies.

342
00:12:59,884 --> 00:13:02,585
Let's move on to
the world of sports.

343
00:13:02,587 --> 00:13:05,555
Oh, wait, sorry-- I just thought
of another space one.

344
00:13:05,557 --> 00:13:07,890
"I've been bitten
by a moon snake.

345
00:13:07,892 --> 00:13:10,459
You need to suck all the
space poison out of my--"

346
00:13:10,461 --> 00:13:12,145
Okay, Barney, uh,

347
00:13:12,147 --> 00:13:13,679
I have to be at work
tomorrow at 8:00,

348
00:13:13,681 --> 00:13:15,348
which means I have
just about enough time

349
00:13:15,350 --> 00:13:17,750
to sit in a shower for 11 hours,
hugging myself.

350
00:13:20,087 --> 00:13:21,237
So this was fun.

351
00:13:21,239 --> 00:13:22,455
Can I call you, or...?

352
00:13:22,457 --> 00:13:25,608
Barney, you're funny, handsome

353
00:13:25,610 --> 00:13:27,276
and really quite clever.

354
00:13:27,278 --> 00:13:29,445
But you're also a sociopath.

355
00:13:29,447 --> 00:13:31,347
Well, I count three pros
and one con, so...

356
00:13:31,349 --> 00:13:33,833
How do you still think
you have a chance with me?

357
00:13:33,835 --> 00:13:36,169
Because you sat
here all night.

358
00:13:36,171 --> 00:13:38,321
You could've left right
away, but you didn't.

359
00:13:39,289 --> 00:13:43,759
Look, Nora, all those lies--
that's the old me.

360
00:13:43,761 --> 00:13:46,562
But I swear to you,
I am trying to change.

361
00:13:46,564 --> 00:13:50,466
You... make me want to change.

362
00:13:50,468 --> 00:13:53,352
How do I know that's not a lie?

363
00:13:53,354 --> 00:13:55,071
I'll prove it.

364
00:13:55,073 --> 00:13:56,939
I will prove how serious I am.

365
00:13:56,941 --> 00:13:59,675
I will not leave this diner

366
00:13:59,677 --> 00:14:02,879
until I get
a second date with you.

367
00:14:03,981 --> 00:14:05,198
Good-bye, Barney.

368
00:14:05,649 --> 00:14:07,033
I'm not kidding.

369
00:14:07,035 --> 00:14:08,484
This is a 24-hour diner.

370
00:14:08,486 --> 00:14:12,121
I'll stay here forever,
if I have to-- and I will!

371
00:14:13,991 --> 00:14:15,691
Just water for me. Thanks.

372
00:14:18,194 --> 00:14:20,997
Okay, so red indicates
level of attractiveness,

373
00:14:20,999 --> 00:14:23,466
blue--
intellectual stimulation,

374
00:14:23,468 --> 00:14:25,051
green-- emotional connection,

375
00:14:25,053 --> 00:14:27,703
yellow-- compatibility
of life goals,

376
00:14:27,705 --> 00:14:31,206
and purple-- whether or not
she reached for the check.

377
00:14:32,042 --> 00:14:33,643
Well, it looks like
Jessica's ahead

378
00:14:33,645 --> 00:14:35,711
in the first
four categories.

379
00:14:36,881 --> 00:14:40,416
Did not reach for the check...

380
00:14:42,853 --> 00:14:44,053
Oh, this?

381
00:14:45,222 --> 00:14:46,722
No big deal. This...

382
00:14:46,724 --> 00:14:48,357
This cost three
months rent,

383
00:14:48,359 --> 00:14:50,026
and, uh, I've never
gotten to wear it,

384
00:14:50,028 --> 00:14:52,862
because I bought it for that big
event that you invited me to,

385
00:14:52,864 --> 00:14:54,396
which then fell through.

386
00:14:54,398 --> 00:14:55,831
But, you know what?

387
00:14:55,833 --> 00:14:57,450
Don't feel guilty about that.

388
00:14:57,452 --> 00:14:58,417
What big event?

389
00:14:58,419 --> 00:14:59,568
That thing with your uncle.

390
00:14:59,570 --> 00:15:01,354
His funeral?

391
00:15:02,089 --> 00:15:03,205
It didn't fall through,

392
00:15:03,207 --> 00:15:04,707
he miraculously
came out of a coma.

393
00:15:04,709 --> 00:15:06,509
And I forgive you.

394
00:15:06,511 --> 00:15:09,095
Now, can I please
meet Lenny Kravitz?

395
00:15:12,415 --> 00:15:13,883
I did it again!

396
00:15:13,885 --> 00:15:15,801
Aw, honey.

397
00:15:15,803 --> 00:15:17,086
You got drunk again.

398
00:15:17,088 --> 00:15:19,722
I can't believe
I took the over.

399
00:15:19,724 --> 00:15:24,193
Just to be clear, "I did it
again" is not a reference...

400
00:15:24,195 --> 00:15:26,762
to my current state of
inebriation.

401
00:15:26,764 --> 00:15:28,931
What's it a reference to?

402
00:15:28,933 --> 00:15:30,900
My name is Marshall Eriksen.

403
00:15:30,902 --> 00:15:32,885
I'm 33 years old.

404
00:15:32,887 --> 00:15:37,957
And if my potential future
employer, Garrison Cootes,

405
00:15:37,959 --> 00:15:40,442
is watching this...

406
00:15:40,444 --> 00:15:43,129
bow down to Beercules!

407
00:15:50,087 --> 00:15:51,921
Well, that could
be anybody.

408
00:15:57,363 --> 00:15:58,695
Oh, goodness.

409
00:16:06,077 --> 00:16:07,986
Pete, this is Lily Aldrin.

410
00:16:07,987 --> 00:16:09,720
I'm gonna make this real simple:

411
00:16:09,722 --> 00:16:11,572
You're gonna take down
that video of Marshall.

412
00:16:11,574 --> 00:16:12,973
You know why?

413
00:16:12,975 --> 00:16:16,026
Because I'm friends with three
girls who dated you in college,

414
00:16:16,028 --> 00:16:18,528
and girls
tell each other everything.

415
00:16:18,530 --> 00:16:21,215
Every <i>tiny</i> detail.

416
00:16:21,217 --> 00:16:22,533
Huh. So...

417
00:16:22,535 --> 00:16:27,888
tick-tock, Pete-- tick-tock goes
the little wee-wee clock.

418
00:16:28,757 --> 00:16:29,873
Pete's got a little wee-wee?

419
00:16:29,875 --> 00:16:31,592
No idea.
What's everyone getting?

420
00:16:31,594 --> 00:16:34,762
This was bound to
happen eventually.

421
00:16:34,764 --> 00:16:37,731
I've been trying so hard
to suppress, like,

422
00:16:37,733 --> 00:16:39,383
my carefree idiot side,

423
00:16:39,385 --> 00:16:43,220
that it just rebelled
and came out swingin'!

424
00:16:43,222 --> 00:16:44,388
It sure did.

425
00:16:44,390 --> 00:16:46,774
Look at me! I'm a windmill!

426
00:16:46,776 --> 00:16:49,944
Who am I kidding?
I'm not ready to be a dad.

427
00:16:49,946 --> 00:16:52,780
I thought that I was,
but it's, like...

428
00:16:52,782 --> 00:16:55,916
my dad never did stuff
like that, you know?

429
00:16:55,918 --> 00:16:57,401
So what if he did?

430
00:16:57,403 --> 00:16:59,286
You'd still love him.

431
00:16:59,288 --> 00:17:02,923
And be honest-- wouldn't you
love to stumble onto a video

432
00:17:02,925 --> 00:17:05,442
of him running down
the street naked, yelling,

433
00:17:05,444 --> 00:17:07,177
"Hey, Marshall, look at me!

434
00:17:07,179 --> 00:17:09,697
I got an icicle on my deal!"

435
00:17:13,936 --> 00:17:15,219
Oh! Hey, guys!

436
00:17:15,221 --> 00:17:16,920
Ow! My neck!

437
00:17:16,922 --> 00:17:19,390
Uh... oh! Hey!

438
00:17:19,392 --> 00:17:20,808
Look at that.

439
00:17:20,810 --> 00:17:23,427
Barney, what are
you doing here?

440
00:17:23,429 --> 00:17:26,530
Oh, I told Nora I wouldn't leave
until she gave me a second date,

441
00:17:26,532 --> 00:17:27,815
and I mean it.

442
00:17:27,817 --> 00:17:29,266
I've already been here
nine hours.

443
00:17:29,268 --> 00:17:32,036
I still need
another minute.

444
00:17:32,038 --> 00:17:35,289
I mean... call me crazy, but

445
00:17:35,291 --> 00:17:37,891
I'm gonna stay here until
I get that girl back.

446
00:17:40,611 --> 00:17:43,797
That-- that's
what I want.

447
00:17:44,716 --> 00:17:46,300
The way Barney
feels about Nora--

448
00:17:46,302 --> 00:17:47,951
I want that feeling again.

449
00:17:48,953 --> 00:17:50,838
I don't want to be choosing
between two girls,

450
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:55,642
I want to be... a complete
head-over-heels idiot for one.

451
00:17:55,644 --> 00:17:57,728
Yeah, the complete
head-over-heels idiot thing's

452
00:17:57,730 --> 00:17:59,897
pretty nice.

453
00:18:00,982 --> 00:18:02,316
It's not bad.

454
00:18:02,318 --> 00:18:05,102
Although, for the record--

455
00:18:05,104 --> 00:18:08,572
sweeping declaration!--

456
00:18:08,574 --> 00:18:13,494
I am never getting
drunk again.

457
00:18:14,413 --> 00:18:16,430
<i>And sure enough...</i>

458
00:18:16,432 --> 00:18:18,332
All hail Beercules!

459
00:18:19,719 --> 00:18:21,018
Yeah!

460
00:18:21,020 --> 00:18:23,704
<i>But, again,</i>
<i>I'm getting ahead of myself.</i>

461
00:18:32,847 --> 00:18:34,014
Hello.

462
00:18:34,016 --> 00:18:36,166
Marshall! Garrison Cootes.

463
00:18:36,168 --> 00:18:37,334
Yes, Mr. Cootes.

464
00:18:37,336 --> 00:18:38,652
Hi. How are you?

465
00:18:38,654 --> 00:18:40,604
I just wanted to let you know,
we did the background check,

466
00:18:40,606 --> 00:18:43,307
and that is
some disturbing streaking.

467
00:18:43,309 --> 00:18:45,109
Sir, th-th-the thing is, um...

468
00:18:45,111 --> 00:18:47,177
The rainbow streaking
in this sample

469
00:18:47,179 --> 00:18:49,029
is definitely
from chemical runoff.

470
00:18:49,031 --> 00:18:51,181
Oh, I...

471
00:18:51,183 --> 00:18:54,184
Bottom line-- we'd love to have
you on board.

472
00:18:54,186 --> 00:18:55,202
That is fantastic!

473
00:18:55,204 --> 00:18:57,354
Thank you, Mr. Cootes!

474
00:18:57,356 --> 00:18:58,355
Well, you're welcome.

475
00:18:58,357 --> 00:19:00,157
And-- oh, and when
you're at the office,

476
00:19:00,159 --> 00:19:02,409
try to wear some clothes,
okay, Beercules?

477
00:19:04,747 --> 00:19:06,046
Wow! That's a big snake.

478
00:19:06,048 --> 00:19:07,214
Oh, there's
a snake in the swamp?

479
00:19:07,216 --> 00:19:08,665
No, I'm talking about
your penis.

480
00:19:08,667 --> 00:19:09,983
See you tomorrow.

481
00:19:11,536 --> 00:19:12,419
I got the job.

482
00:19:12,421 --> 00:19:13,870
Yay!

483
00:19:13,872 --> 00:19:16,306
And I think that my boss
already sexually harassed me.

484
00:19:16,308 --> 00:19:18,892
But he saw the video
and he doesn't care!

485
00:19:18,894 --> 00:19:21,812
See that? Maybe Beercules
isn't so bad after all.

486
00:19:21,814 --> 00:19:22,763
Yeah.

487
00:19:24,150 --> 00:19:25,215
Hello?

488
00:19:25,217 --> 00:19:27,734
Hey, Marshall,
my name is Pete Durkenson.

489
00:19:27,736 --> 00:19:29,153
We went to Wesleyan together.

490
00:19:29,155 --> 00:19:30,404
Yeah, no, I know.

491
00:19:30,406 --> 00:19:32,606
Pete, we... we just
hung out yesterday.

492
00:19:32,608 --> 00:19:34,825
All right, now Lily's message
makes a little more sense.

493
00:19:34,827 --> 00:19:37,361
Listen, don't worry, bro,
I'm gonna take down the video.

494
00:19:37,363 --> 00:19:38,579
You know what?

495
00:19:38,581 --> 00:19:40,063
Leave it up.

496
00:19:40,065 --> 00:19:41,832
Whatever you say, Beercules.

497
00:19:44,786 --> 00:19:46,703
Scalpel.

498
00:19:46,705 --> 00:19:48,922
You know what?
This is good.

499
00:19:48,924 --> 00:19:51,341
I want our kid to see
every side of who I am.

500
00:19:51,343 --> 00:19:52,593
Yeah.

501
00:19:52,595 --> 00:19:54,077
Even the side that runs through

502
00:19:54,079 --> 00:19:56,196
the East Village hangin' brain.

503
00:19:57,765 --> 00:19:59,133
I'm gonna call Pete back.

504
00:19:59,135 --> 00:20:00,551
That's a good idea.

505
00:20:00,553 --> 00:20:03,753
<i>That evening, I took</i>
<i>Robin to the Architects' Ball.</i>

506
00:20:03,755 --> 00:20:05,439
Thanks again for
taking me to this.

507
00:20:05,441 --> 00:20:06,473
Mm. My pleasure.

508
00:20:06,475 --> 00:20:07,774
And, you know, you might
find it interesting.

509
00:20:07,776 --> 00:20:09,893
Some of these guys represent the
living history of New York--

510
00:20:09,895 --> 00:20:11,261
Yeah, yeah.
Where's Lenny Kravitz?

511
00:20:11,263 --> 00:20:12,929
Right there.

512
00:20:12,931 --> 00:20:16,783
Leonard Kravitz,
world-renowned architect.

513
00:20:16,785 --> 00:20:19,036
Guy's a rock star.

514
00:20:19,038 --> 00:20:20,654
He's gonna be
giving his famous

515
00:20:20,656 --> 00:20:22,039
90-minute lecture
on crossbeams.

516
00:20:22,041 --> 00:20:23,540
Well, great.

517
00:20:23,542 --> 00:20:25,826
I'm gonna go find one
and hang myself from it.

518
00:20:25,828 --> 00:20:27,244
Okay.

519
00:20:27,246 --> 00:20:30,130
<i>Kids, you can't talk</i>
<i>yourself into falling in love.</i>

520
00:20:30,132 --> 00:20:32,949
<i>It doesn't take days</i>
<i>of deliberation.</i>

521
00:20:32,951 --> 00:20:36,503
<i>When it's real,</i>
<i>you know pretty quickly,</i>

522
00:20:36,505 --> 00:20:39,789
<i>and with absolute certainty.</i>

523
00:20:41,059 --> 00:20:43,627
<i>I had forgotten that.</i>

524
00:20:43,629 --> 00:20:45,979
But I was about to be reminded.

525
00:20:45,981 --> 00:20:49,733
? Victoria ?

526
00:20:49,735 --> 00:20:51,902
