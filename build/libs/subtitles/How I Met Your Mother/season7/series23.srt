<i>Kids, when Aunt Lily</i>

2
00:00:04,032 --> 00:00:06,589
<i>Marshall was somewhere</i>
<i>slightly inconvenient,</i>

3
00:00:06,592 --> 00:00:09,260
<i>in Atlantic City</i>
<i>with Uncle Barney,</i>

4
00:00:09,262 --> 00:00:11,929
<i>and drunk to the point of</i>
<i>talking like Yoda.</i>

5
00:00:11,931 --> 00:00:13,847
Baby come...

6
00:00:13,849 --> 00:00:15,499
Papa gonna be am I...

7
00:00:15,501 --> 00:00:17,718
Hospital must we get now...

8
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:20,471
Okay, there's like a four-hour
wait at the valet stand.

9
00:00:20,473 --> 00:00:23,524
Plus, we're in no shape to
drive. So, a car's out...

10
00:00:23,526 --> 00:00:26,810
Wait, don't worry. We'll take
a cab to the train station.

11
00:00:26,812 --> 00:00:28,295
Yeah, good luck
getting a cab.

12
00:00:28,297 --> 00:00:29,897
It's impossible because
of the big thing.

13
00:00:29,899 --> 00:00:32,066
<i>Kids, for the life of</i>
<i>me, I can't remember</i>

14
00:00:32,068 --> 00:00:34,702
<i>what the big thing was in</i>
<i>Atlantic City that weekend.</i>

15
00:00:34,704 --> 00:00:36,971
<i>Was it</i>
<i>a cheerleading convention?</i>

16
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:41,325
<i>No, it was</i>
<i>a porn convention.</i>

17
00:00:41,327 --> 00:00:44,311
<i>Sci-fi convention?</i>

18
00:00:44,313 --> 00:00:46,330
<i>Eh, I can't remember.</i>

19
00:00:48,950 --> 00:00:53,420
We're stuck in Atlantic City!
City of Atlantic stuck in are we.

22
00:01:06,401 --> 00:01:08,785
Okay, Lily,
it's going to be fine.

23
00:01:08,786 --> 00:01:12,121
We are not freaking out.
We are not freaking out!

24
00:01:12,608 --> 00:01:15,659
I feel calmer already.
Let's get you to the hospital.

25
00:01:15,661 --> 00:01:17,695
Oh, I can't go yet.
I talked to Dr. Sonya.

26
00:01:17,697 --> 00:01:19,530
They won't admit me
until my contractions

27
00:01:19,532 --> 00:01:20,485
are four minutes apart.

28
00:01:20,510 --> 00:01:22,117
Okay, well, if you
don't make it in time,

29
00:01:22,118 --> 00:01:25,235
I have got you covered. When I
was 13, my father caught me

30
00:01:25,237 --> 00:01:27,504
kissing a boy, so he sent me
to our family's ranch

31
00:01:27,506 --> 00:01:29,840
for foaling season.
Once you see a baby horse

32
00:01:29,842 --> 00:01:32,292
erupt through that birth canal,
you stop even touching yourself.

33
00:01:32,294 --> 00:01:35,078
Anyway, I had skinny arms,
so I got up there elbow deep.

34
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:36,680
I lost this watch
birthing Blacky...

35
00:01:36,682 --> 00:01:40,267
Okay, stop it. I am not
a farm animal.

36
00:01:40,269 --> 00:01:43,253
Oh, there we go.
Easy girl. Sugar cube?

37
00:01:43,255 --> 00:01:44,855
Oh, okay.

38
00:01:44,857 --> 00:01:46,757
Ah, don't worry, Lil.

39
00:01:46,759 --> 00:01:49,026
Some of us know what
a woman actually needs

40
00:01:49,028 --> 00:01:50,260
at a time like this.

41
00:01:50,262 --> 00:01:54,431
A kick-ass
labor announcement e-mail.

42
00:01:54,433 --> 00:01:56,483
<i>A man,</i>

43
00:01:56,485 --> 00:01:57,818
<i>a woman,</i>

44
00:01:57,820 --> 00:01:59,386
<i>and their best friend,</i>

45
00:01:59,388 --> 00:02:01,805
<i>embark on an</i>
<i>incredible journey.</i>

46
00:02:01,807 --> 00:02:05,292
<i>Lily's cervix is dilating,</i>
<i>and we want you all</i>

47
00:02:05,294 --> 00:02:07,911
<i>to be part of its</i>
<i>grand opening.</i>

48
00:02:07,913 --> 00:02:10,247
You are not sending that
to anyone, ever.

49
00:02:10,249 --> 00:02:14,218
So what I need right now is
distraction from the pain.

50
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:15,886
Just tell me a story.

51
00:02:15,888 --> 00:02:17,971
Uh, what story?
I don't care. Anything.

52
00:02:17,973 --> 00:02:19,873
How about the worst
cab ride ever?

53
00:02:19,875 --> 00:02:21,675
Clean your window for you? - No!

54
00:02:21,677 --> 00:02:23,093
Hey, get off my cab!

55
00:02:25,514 --> 00:02:27,264
Oh! Oh, God!

56
00:02:27,266 --> 00:02:29,316
Oh! Ah!

57
00:02:34,607 --> 00:02:36,907
We are not panicking!
We are not panicking!

58
00:02:36,909 --> 00:02:38,975
Get on all fours;
it widens your hind quarters.

59
00:02:38,977 --> 00:02:41,978
Stop it! I am not
a farm animal!

60
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:44,782
But give me that sugar cube.

61
00:02:44,784 --> 00:02:47,668
Okay, listen, I am going to
get you to that hospital

62
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:50,337
or die trying.
And if I succeed,

63
00:02:50,339 --> 00:02:52,372
I ask only one thing in return.

64
00:02:52,374 --> 00:02:55,292
Let me choose
your child's middle name.

65
00:02:55,294 --> 00:02:58,045
Because I have thought up the
most awesome name of all time.

66
00:02:58,047 --> 00:02:59,680
What's the middle name?

67
00:02:59,682 --> 00:03:01,331
Wait for it...

68
00:03:01,333 --> 00:03:02,966
I'm waiting.

69
00:03:02,968 --> 00:03:04,184
Wait for it...

70
00:03:04,186 --> 00:03:05,969
I said I'm waiting.

71
00:03:05,971 --> 00:03:08,305
Wait for it.
What's the middle name?

72
00:03:08,307 --> 00:03:10,741
No, the middle name is
"Wait For It."

73
00:03:10,743 --> 00:03:13,227
Let's say his first name is,
oh, I don't know, Barney.

74
00:03:13,229 --> 00:03:17,764
He'd be Barney
"Wait For It" Eriksen.

75
00:03:17,766 --> 00:03:19,967
How awesome is that?

76
00:03:21,319 --> 00:03:22,753
That is...

77
00:03:22,755 --> 00:03:25,706
the coolest...
middle name of all time.

78
00:03:25,708 --> 00:03:27,941
I know!
Okay, listen.

79
00:03:27,943 --> 00:03:30,828
I have a plan
to get us to New York.

80
00:03:30,830 --> 00:03:33,831
All we have to do is get our
hands on that motorcycle.

81
00:03:33,833 --> 00:03:39,520
And I know just the way
to do it.

82
00:03:45,594 --> 00:03:46,543
Here.

83
00:03:46,545 --> 00:03:49,179
Oh. Hi, Judy.

84
00:03:49,181 --> 00:03:53,267
Oh, good.
You got the e-mail from Ted.

85
00:03:53,269 --> 00:03:56,770
No, I am not worried my
city hips are too narrow,

86
00:03:56,772 --> 00:03:59,106
and-and your grandson's
going to get stuck.

87
00:03:59,108 --> 00:04:00,657
I got to go.

88
00:04:00,659 --> 00:04:03,193
I thought you deleted
that stupid e-mail.

89
00:04:03,195 --> 00:04:05,395
Okay, I sent it by accident.

90
00:04:05,397 --> 00:04:07,331
She like it?
Yes!

91
00:04:07,333 --> 00:04:09,065
Just keep telling me stories!

92
00:04:09,067 --> 00:04:13,921
Okay, okay, I got one for you:
second base with Neil Young.

93
00:04:13,923 --> 00:04:15,839
Um,

94
00:04:15,841 --> 00:04:20,711
I don't normally go to, um,
second base and tell,

95
00:04:20,713 --> 00:04:25,749
but I just spent
a magical night with Neil Young.

96
00:04:25,751 --> 00:04:27,634
He's still in my room.

97
00:04:27,636 --> 00:04:29,219
Seriously?
Oh, my God.

98
00:04:29,221 --> 00:04:31,021
Be quiet, don't scare him off.

99
00:04:32,308 --> 00:04:33,757
He-Hey...

100
00:04:36,311 --> 00:04:38,445
Robin...
Yeah.

101
00:04:39,397 --> 00:04:41,231
That's not Neil Young.

102
00:04:43,051 --> 00:04:45,268
Oh, God.

103
00:04:46,355 --> 00:04:49,157
Oh, we're busting apple bags?
I can bust apple bags.

104
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:52,284
Ted, remember when we were
dating and we threw that party

105
00:04:52,286 --> 00:04:54,636
and one of those appetizers
just didn't sit right?

106
00:04:54,638 --> 00:04:57,556
Ah... doesn't sound familiar.

107
00:04:57,558 --> 00:05:01,626
I call this story "Ted and
the Cuban Sandwich Crisis."

108
00:05:03,330 --> 00:05:05,597
<i>Ted came out of that</i>
<i>bathroom looking like</i>

109
00:05:05,599 --> 00:05:08,600
<i>Joe Frazier after</i>
<i>the Thrilla in Manila.</i>

110
00:05:08,602 --> 00:05:11,987
Oh, what is that smell!?

111
00:05:11,989 --> 00:05:13,906
Ugh!

112
00:05:13,908 --> 00:05:19,111
So I, being a great girlfriend,
<i>tried to help him out.</i>

113
00:05:22,782 --> 00:05:24,700
You guys are all crazy;
I don't smell anything.

114
00:05:24,702 --> 00:05:26,785
Anyway, uh, who wants to
go up on the roof?

115
00:05:26,787 --> 00:05:27,786
<i>But then...</i>

116
00:05:27,788 --> 00:05:31,673
She, who denied it, supplied it.

117
00:05:31,675 --> 00:05:35,438
Yeah, must have been that
Cuban sandwich, huh, babe?

118
00:05:37,465 --> 00:05:38,847
That was not cool, Ted.

119
00:05:38,849 --> 00:05:40,182
Contraction!

120
00:05:40,184 --> 00:05:42,301
That wasn't cool, Ted?

121
00:05:42,303 --> 00:05:44,103
Just keep going
with the stories.

122
00:05:44,105 --> 00:05:45,854
I don't even care
if I've heard it before.

123
00:05:45,856 --> 00:05:48,690
Just tell me, uh,
"Where Does That Door Go?"

124
00:05:48,692 --> 00:05:49,875
Okay.

125
00:05:49,877 --> 00:05:53,662
Hey, I've never noticed
that door before.

126
00:05:55,315 --> 00:05:57,900
I wonder where it goes.

127
00:06:00,987 --> 00:06:03,188
Ted.
Ted.

128
00:06:03,190 --> 00:06:05,541
No, no, no, let him...
let him...

129
00:06:10,046 --> 00:06:12,347
Wow...

130
00:06:16,469 --> 00:06:18,203
Don't...
No...

131
00:06:18,205 --> 00:06:20,005
Robi....

132
00:06:26,229 --> 00:06:28,897
Oh...

133
00:06:28,899 --> 00:06:30,649
Wow...

134
00:06:31,885 --> 00:06:33,318
Dad, oh, good.

135
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:35,554
Let me guess,
you got Ted's e-mail.

136
00:06:35,556 --> 00:06:38,890
I'm on my way, Princess.
Dad, wait, no, not...

137
00:06:38,892 --> 00:06:40,075
Damn it, Ted.

138
00:06:40,077 --> 00:06:44,279
I was okay with you e-mailing
my aunt, my cousins,

139
00:06:44,281 --> 00:06:46,915
and your cousins, and the guy
that Robin thought was Neil Young.

140
00:06:46,917 --> 00:06:50,869
But my father is the absolute
worst person to have around

141
00:06:50,871 --> 00:06:53,255
in any sort of
medical situation.

142
00:06:53,257 --> 00:06:55,073
<i>When I was seven, I needed</i>

143
00:06:55,075 --> 00:06:56,391
<i>to have my tonsils out.</i>

144
00:06:56,393 --> 00:06:58,343
Daddy, I'm scared.

145
00:06:58,345 --> 00:07:02,181
Aw, Princess, I would be too.
I've researched this surgery.

146
00:07:02,183 --> 00:07:05,350
Anything can happen.
You could bleed to death...

147
00:07:05,352 --> 00:07:07,936
...you could have your jaw
removed due to infection,

148
00:07:07,938 --> 00:07:10,922
and the anesthesia could
suddenly just stop working,

149
00:07:10,924 --> 00:07:12,808
much like your mom's
and my marriage.

150
00:07:15,729 --> 00:07:18,930
You do know that we're
getting a divor...

151
00:07:18,932 --> 00:07:21,783
Don't worry about it. We'll talk
about it after the surgery.

152
00:07:21,785 --> 00:07:24,102
Calm down, girl.

153
00:07:24,104 --> 00:07:26,705
Okay, for the last time,
I am not...

154
00:07:26,707 --> 00:07:29,541
Actually, keep going.

155
00:07:29,543 --> 00:07:32,578
Okay, I admit the whole "win a
motorcycle plan" was stupid.

156
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:36,932
Especially because we've been
playing on the wrong machine.

157
00:07:39,470 --> 00:07:42,087
Meet me at the entrance
in five minutes.

158
00:07:46,093 --> 00:07:50,262
Hop on, Marshall.
Tonight, we ride!

159
00:07:50,264 --> 00:07:52,064
You won that?

160
00:07:52,066 --> 00:07:54,933
Not exactly. You see, I...

161
00:07:54,935 --> 00:07:56,318
Get off!

162
00:08:00,732 --> 00:08:03,534
I hope Marshall's close.
Cube me.

163
00:08:05,677 --> 00:08:07,678
I'm on my way, Lily Pad.

164
00:08:10,098 --> 00:08:11,464
<i>Kids, your Uncle Marshall</i>

165
00:08:11,466 --> 00:08:13,734
<i>has faced many challenges</i>
<i>in his life.</i>

166
00:08:13,736 --> 00:08:15,736
<i>But he still considers</i>
<i>getting up these two steps</i>

167
00:08:15,738 --> 00:08:18,488
<i>when he was this drunk to be</i>
<i>the hardest one of all.</i>

168
00:08:34,589 --> 00:08:36,456
Tell me a Marshall story.
I miss him.

169
00:08:36,458 --> 00:08:40,544
Got it.
"The Tale of the Cursed Pants."

170
00:08:40,546 --> 00:08:43,547
Hey, guys.

171
00:08:43,549 --> 00:08:46,383
So, I'm starting worry
about these pants.

172
00:08:46,385 --> 00:08:47,434
Starting to?

173
00:08:47,436 --> 00:08:49,302
No, ever since I got them,
terrible things

174
00:08:49,304 --> 00:08:51,221
have been happening to me:
I stubbed my toe,

175
00:08:51,223 --> 00:08:53,506
I missed my train...
You put on the pants.

176
00:08:53,508 --> 00:08:56,509
And then the lady at the thrift
store said that for years,

177
00:08:56,511 --> 00:08:58,194
no one so much as tried them on.
Can you believe that?

178
00:08:58,219 --> 00:08:59,814
Yes.

179
00:08:59,815 --> 00:09:01,481
You know what this means?

180
00:09:01,483 --> 00:09:04,801
These pants are cursed.

181
00:09:06,654 --> 00:09:08,688
What's this in the pocket?

182
00:09:11,159 --> 00:09:13,293
A clue.

183
00:09:13,295 --> 00:09:15,712
<i>Marshall had</i>
<i>the writing translated.</i>

184
00:09:15,714 --> 00:09:18,965
<i>It led him deep</i>
<i>into the heart of Chinatown.</i>

185
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:31,445
It is you.

186
00:09:31,447 --> 00:09:33,930
The One has arrived.

187
00:09:41,272 --> 00:09:43,840
Dry cleaning, $21.50.

188
00:09:43,842 --> 00:09:46,493
I remember that suit.
He looked like

189
00:09:46,495 --> 00:09:49,329
a little kid's imaginary friend.

190
00:09:49,331 --> 00:09:51,231
Where is he?!

191
00:09:51,233 --> 00:09:53,316
<i>Now, Uncle Marshall</i>
<i>knew he had only one chance</i>

192
00:09:53,318 --> 00:09:55,068
<i>of getting out</i>
<i>of Atlantic City:</i>

193
00:09:55,070 --> 00:09:57,370
<i>bribing a cab driver.</i>

194
00:09:57,372 --> 00:09:59,422
Machine that gives money!

195
00:10:05,296 --> 00:10:07,047
<i>Now, Marshall</i>
<i>was pretty drunk,</i>

196
00:10:07,049 --> 00:10:09,950
<i>but he swears the ATM</i>
<i>started to do this.</i>

197
00:10:27,401 --> 00:10:29,602
Stop
hitting me. Just for that,

198
00:10:29,604 --> 00:10:32,322
you're never getting home
for the birth of your son.

199
00:10:41,999 --> 00:10:45,418
No!!

200
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:47,053
What's up, bro?

201
00:10:47,055 --> 00:10:49,789
Wait, how did you...
with the security?

202
00:10:49,791 --> 00:10:51,124
I'll explain.

203
00:10:53,512 --> 00:10:56,479
Tell me why we shouldn't
call the authorities...

204
00:10:56,481 --> 00:10:59,566
right now?
Go ahead, call 'em.

205
00:10:59,568 --> 00:11:02,802
But first, can you show me
the rule that says you can't

206
00:11:02,804 --> 00:11:05,488
drive a motorcycle
on the casino floor?

207
00:11:08,993 --> 00:11:10,660
It's not in here.

208
00:11:13,030 --> 00:11:17,117
<i>And, kids, that sign</i>
<i>is still there to this day.</i>

209
00:11:18,202 --> 00:11:20,036
When I came out,
I ran into this guy.

210
00:11:20,038 --> 00:11:21,621
Two seats just opened up

211
00:11:21,623 --> 00:11:24,657
on his bus to New York!

212
00:11:24,659 --> 00:11:27,294
Barney, you're a genius!

213
00:11:27,296 --> 00:11:28,762
Plus, here's the best part.

214
00:11:28,764 --> 00:11:31,181
This Quinn thing is probably
done, so I'm basically single.

215
00:11:31,183 --> 00:11:34,885
He said the bus is full of
hot college seniors.

216
00:11:34,887 --> 00:11:37,854
Okay, maybe he didn't
say "college."

217
00:11:37,856 --> 00:11:39,472
Or "hot."

218
00:11:39,474 --> 00:11:41,892
I miss Quinn.

219
00:11:42,895 --> 00:11:44,311
What is taking Marshall so long?

220
00:11:44,313 --> 00:11:45,145
Salt lick?

221
00:11:45,147 --> 00:11:47,430
Just finish the door story!

222
00:12:00,544 --> 00:12:03,213
Oh, wow.

223
00:12:05,249 --> 00:12:08,084
I don't like this.

224
00:12:08,086 --> 00:12:10,220
Okay, okay, that's
four minutes!

225
00:12:10,222 --> 00:12:11,421
We're going to
the hospital.

226
00:12:11,423 --> 00:12:12,889
W-Wait, but Marshall's
not here yet.

227
00:12:12,891 --> 00:12:14,925
I can't go to the hospital
without Marshall!

228
00:12:14,927 --> 00:12:16,309
I'm on it.
Lily, spread your legs.

229
00:12:16,311 --> 00:12:18,011
I'm gonna see if we can
see the hooves--

230
00:12:18,013 --> 00:12:19,646
uh, the-the snout--
uh, the head.

231
00:12:19,648 --> 00:12:21,431
Here we go.
Take me to the hospital now.

232
00:12:21,433 --> 00:12:23,266
Okay. Come
on, come on.

233
00:12:23,268 --> 00:12:24,384
Excuse me, sir.

234
00:12:24,386 --> 00:12:26,403
My wife is in labor,
and I really need to

235
00:12:26,405 --> 00:12:27,570
get to Saint Marcus Hospital.

236
00:12:27,572 --> 00:12:30,440
So where exactly in New York
does this bus drop off?

237
00:12:30,442 --> 00:12:31,925
Buffalo.

238
00:12:37,097 --> 00:12:39,073
What do you mean
I can't have an epidural?

239
00:12:39,098 --> 00:12:40,645
You're too far along.

240
00:12:40,745 --> 00:12:43,412
Things are moving much faster
than expected.

241
00:12:45,082 --> 00:12:47,416
Look, if your hands
are tied medically,

242
00:12:47,418 --> 00:12:49,969
just leave the epidural
on the table and walk away.

243
00:12:49,971 --> 00:12:51,504
Don't worry.

244
00:12:51,506 --> 00:12:53,673
The baby slide right out, huh?

245
00:12:53,675 --> 00:12:55,258
It's like a whoosh.

246
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:56,642
Like a waterslide.

247
00:12:58,796 --> 00:13:00,813
Slightly painful
waterslide.

248
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:03,849
Tell me a story now!

249
00:13:03,851 --> 00:13:04,967
Uh...
Uh...

250
00:13:04,969 --> 00:13:06,102
Oh! Remember the time Barney

251
00:13:06,104 --> 00:13:07,658
tried to pick up girls
as the Terminator?

252
00:13:07,683 --> 00:13:09,683
Yes.

253
00:13:13,110 --> 00:13:15,361
? ?

254
00:13:22,703 --> 00:13:26,005
Come
with me if you want to bang.

255
00:13:27,341 --> 00:13:28,841
Another.

256
00:13:28,843 --> 00:13:31,610
Oh, uh, Ted and the
freakishly long arm hair!

257
00:13:31,612 --> 00:13:33,095
No, I disagree,
because the filling--

258
00:13:33,097 --> 00:13:35,631
It depends on
what you're eating, right?

259
00:13:35,633 --> 00:13:36,498
If it's...

260
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:38,434
Whoa. What the...?

261
00:13:38,436 --> 00:13:40,519
Whoa.

262
00:13:40,521 --> 00:13:43,856
The debunking of the
freakishly long arm hair.

263
00:13:43,858 --> 00:13:47,343
Wait, it's-it's
just a thread.

264
00:13:48,362 --> 00:13:49,779
I was jealous, okay?

265
00:13:49,781 --> 00:13:51,364
Barney's getting all
the attention today

266
00:13:51,366 --> 00:13:53,482
with this
Terminator thing.

267
00:13:53,484 --> 00:13:56,068
Huh. Can't believe I'm not
getting laid in this thing.

268
00:13:56,070 --> 00:14:00,072
Maybe I need to pick
a different part of the movie.

269
00:14:00,074 --> 00:14:02,208
? ?

270
00:14:07,799 --> 00:14:09,465
Tell me another story!

271
00:14:09,467 --> 00:14:11,684
Oh, hey, we never finished
"Where does that door go""

272
00:14:11,686 --> 00:14:13,052
Come on.

273
00:14:13,054 --> 00:14:14,537
Let's check it out.

274
00:14:14,539 --> 00:14:16,055
You know what, baby,
they're gone.

275
00:14:16,057 --> 00:14:19,358
It's time for us
to move on.

276
00:14:20,877 --> 00:14:23,179
L-Lil...

277
00:14:27,884 --> 00:14:30,403
Oh, my God.

278
00:14:32,223 --> 00:14:33,572
New story!

279
00:14:33,574 --> 00:14:34,907
Uh, the time we tested

280
00:14:34,909 --> 00:14:36,471
if banana peels are
really slippery.

281
00:14:36,496 --> 00:14:37,210
Yes.

282
00:14:37,211 --> 00:14:38,527
Ready?

283
00:14:38,529 --> 00:14:41,864
There's no way
that's really slippery.

284
00:14:44,035 --> 00:14:45,368
Ow! Ow! Ow!

285
00:14:45,370 --> 00:14:47,787
Uh, the Halloween we decided
to go as The Breakfast Club,

286
00:14:47,789 --> 00:14:50,005
but failed to coordinate
our costumes!

287
00:14:50,007 --> 00:14:51,006
Uh...
Does...

288
00:14:51,008 --> 00:14:52,675
Oh.

289
00:14:54,128 --> 00:14:56,045
Really?
I mean, you live with me, Lily.

290
00:14:56,047 --> 00:14:57,079
Yeah, that was funny.

291
00:14:57,081 --> 00:14:58,080
Keep going!

292
00:14:58,082 --> 00:14:59,465
Oh, uh, uh...

293
00:14:59,467 --> 00:15:01,801
the-the time Barney
saved a woman's life.

294
00:15:01,803 --> 00:15:03,085
Ready?

295
00:15:03,087 --> 00:15:06,255
There's no way
that's really slippery.

296
00:15:10,478 --> 00:15:12,211
Uh, the time Lily
went into labor!

297
00:15:12,213 --> 00:15:13,446
That's now!

298
00:15:13,448 --> 00:15:14,647
Sorry, I'm running
out of stories.

299
00:15:14,649 --> 00:15:15,648
Forget it!

300
00:15:15,650 --> 00:15:17,199
They're not working anymore!

301
00:15:17,201 --> 00:15:18,984
Okay, Lily, I know this
isn't how you imagined it,

302
00:15:18,986 --> 00:15:20,152
but I want
you to know

303
00:15:20,154 --> 00:15:22,788
that I am here for you
and I am rock solid!

304
00:15:22,790 --> 00:15:24,824
Oh, I can see its head.

305
00:15:26,626 --> 00:15:28,294
Oh, thank God,
Dr. Sonya!

306
00:15:28,296 --> 00:15:29,278
You!

307
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:32,448
Get that thing
out of my delivery room!

308
00:15:32,450 --> 00:15:34,667
Weak women
disgust me.

309
00:15:34,669 --> 00:15:36,618
All right, Lily, legs up!

310
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:38,003
We push now, yes?!

311
00:15:38,005 --> 00:15:39,839
I can't.
Marshall's not here yet.

312
00:15:39,841 --> 00:15:41,006
Lily!

313
00:15:41,008 --> 00:15:43,809
If you don't push,
I will shove that baby

314
00:15:43,811 --> 00:15:46,679
up your throat
and pull it out of your mouth!

315
00:15:47,899 --> 00:15:49,465
Where the hell is Marshall?!

316
00:15:49,467 --> 00:15:52,134
I can't do this
without Marshall!

317
00:15:52,136 --> 00:15:56,338
<i>Kids, sometimes the universe</i>
<i>sends exactly what you ask for.</i>

318
00:15:56,340 --> 00:15:59,775
<i>Other times,</i>
<i>it sends Lily's dad.</i>

319
00:15:59,777 --> 00:16:01,777
Oh...

320
00:16:01,779 --> 00:16:04,146
Remember the time
you had your tonsils out?

321
00:16:04,148 --> 00:16:05,647
Yeah, yeah.

322
00:16:05,649 --> 00:16:07,199
You scared the crap out of me.

323
00:16:07,201 --> 00:16:09,001
Yes, I did, didn't I?

324
00:16:10,705 --> 00:16:11,954
Oh, my.

325
00:16:11,956 --> 00:16:14,440
But do you remember
what happened next?

326
00:16:14,442 --> 00:16:15,824
And don't worry,
Princess,

327
00:16:15,826 --> 00:16:18,043
if you permanently lose
the ability to speak,

328
00:16:18,045 --> 00:16:19,512
we'll give you
a chalkboard.

329
00:16:19,514 --> 00:16:22,831
You can hang it around your
neck on a little string.

330
00:16:22,833 --> 00:16:26,218
Nurse, I don't know
who this strange man is.

331
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:27,603
Security!

332
00:16:27,605 --> 00:16:29,605
What are you talking about?
I'm your daddy.

333
00:16:29,607 --> 00:16:30,556
What do you mean...

334
00:16:30,558 --> 00:16:31,824
Hey, fellas, come on!

335
00:16:31,826 --> 00:16:34,193
I woke up in a Dumpster
of medical waste,

336
00:16:34,195 --> 00:16:36,645
and I couldn't
have been prouder.

337
00:16:36,647 --> 00:16:39,815
Because, much like
that Dumpster,

338
00:16:39,817 --> 00:16:42,201
you had a lot of guts.

339
00:16:42,203 --> 00:16:46,688
And you've used that bravery
every day of your life.

340
00:16:46,690 --> 00:16:49,241
With or without
Marshall.

341
00:16:49,243 --> 00:16:52,044
You're having
this baby.

342
00:16:52,046 --> 00:16:53,862
Thanks, Dad.

343
00:16:53,864 --> 00:16:55,498
That story actually helped.

344
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:56,882
Oh, good, I'm glad.

345
00:16:56,884 --> 00:16:59,251
And, you know, few women have
vaginal tearing severe enough

346
00:16:59,253 --> 00:17:00,719
to need surgical
reconstruction...

347
00:17:00,721 --> 00:17:02,421
Security!
Oh, come on.

348
00:17:02,423 --> 00:17:03,556
That's not necessary.

349
00:17:03,558 --> 00:17:04,723
Sweetheart, please...

350
00:17:04,725 --> 00:17:06,425
Oh, fellas, come on.

351
00:17:06,427 --> 00:17:07,843
Please, sir,
all you have to do

352
00:17:07,845 --> 00:17:09,178
is take the next exit
to Manhattan.

353
00:17:09,180 --> 00:17:10,896
You'll be back
on the road in 20 minutes.

354
00:17:10,898 --> 00:17:11,931
I already told you,

355
00:17:11,933 --> 00:17:13,215
I'm not allowed to stop.

356
00:17:13,217 --> 00:17:17,219
Sir, this man is
having a baby tonight.

357
00:17:17,221 --> 00:17:19,822
And instead of going
to Saint Marcus Hospital,

358
00:17:19,824 --> 00:17:21,190
we're going to Buffalo.

359
00:17:21,192 --> 00:17:24,076
And I've seen women from there;
the city's aptly named.

360
00:17:25,579 --> 00:17:27,396
Look, I'm a screwup.

361
00:17:27,398 --> 00:17:29,415
I had something special
with this girl Quinn,

362
00:17:29,417 --> 00:17:30,533
and I ruined it.

363
00:17:30,535 --> 00:17:34,169
But this guy--
he's done everything right.

364
00:17:34,171 --> 00:17:36,956
He's been loving and devoted
since he was 18 years old.

365
00:17:36,958 --> 00:17:40,593
There are only a few truly great
people on this planet,

366
00:17:40,595 --> 00:17:42,094
and he is one of them.

367
00:17:42,096 --> 00:17:45,798
He deserves to be
at the birth of his son.

368
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:48,267
So... what do you say?

369
00:17:48,269 --> 00:17:51,520
Unless there's an emergency,
I'm not allowed to stop,

370
00:17:51,522 --> 00:17:55,691
so sit down, watch
<i>Cocoon 2</i> and shut up.

371
00:18:00,263 --> 00:18:02,314
I'm sorry,
buddy, I tried.

372
00:18:02,316 --> 00:18:05,317
<i>And then, something</i>
<i>wonderful happened.</i>

373
00:18:05,319 --> 00:18:07,936
I'm having a heart attack!

374
00:18:09,239 --> 00:18:12,458
I'm having a
heart attack!

375
00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:14,376
I'm having a heart attack!

376
00:18:14,378 --> 00:18:17,463
And my doctor is
at Saint Marcus Hospital!

377
00:18:17,465 --> 00:18:19,048
So is mine!

378
00:18:19,050 --> 00:18:20,165
Mine, too.

379
00:18:20,167 --> 00:18:22,784
And my son is head
of Cardiology.

380
00:18:22,786 --> 00:18:24,837
We know!

381
00:18:26,122 --> 00:18:27,089
Push!

382
00:18:27,091 --> 00:18:29,625
I wish Marshall were here!

383
00:18:29,627 --> 00:18:31,260
I'm here, baby.

384
00:18:31,262 --> 00:18:32,177
Marshall!

385
00:18:32,179 --> 00:18:34,146
I don't know why
I passed out.

386
00:18:34,148 --> 00:18:37,016
I have delivered
12 perfectly healthy babies,

387
00:18:37,018 --> 00:18:38,984
and one of them was even human.

388
00:18:38,986 --> 00:18:40,636
Well, it's different
when it's someone you love.

389
00:18:40,638 --> 00:18:42,488
When that head was coming
out of your best friend.

390
00:18:42,490 --> 00:18:44,323
Oh, stop.
I'm feeling woozy again.

391
00:18:44,325 --> 00:18:45,608
Don't.

392
00:18:45,610 --> 00:18:46,975
Salt lick?

393
00:18:46,977 --> 00:18:50,946
In return for him getting me
here, I may have promised Barney

394
00:18:50,948 --> 00:18:54,950
that our son's middle name
will be Wait For It.

395
00:18:54,952 --> 00:18:57,286
I can't wait, just--
what is the name?

396
00:18:57,288 --> 00:18:59,955
The name is
Wait For It.

397
00:19:01,342 --> 00:19:06,161
That is the coolest middle name
of all time!

398
00:19:06,163 --> 00:19:07,630
Look, um,

399
00:19:07,632 --> 00:19:11,550
I know things have been weird
between us the last few months,

400
00:19:11,552 --> 00:19:12,885
but...

401
00:19:12,887 --> 00:19:14,970
Marshall and Lily
are having a baby.

402
00:19:14,972 --> 00:19:16,271
Yeah.

403
00:19:16,273 --> 00:19:18,524
And, you know,
I want this baby to be born

404
00:19:18,526 --> 00:19:21,010
into a world where we're okay.

405
00:19:21,811 --> 00:19:23,746
So, friends?

406
00:19:23,748 --> 00:19:25,414
I love you, Robin.

407
00:19:26,116 --> 00:19:27,066
Kidding.

408
00:19:27,068 --> 00:19:27,950
You...

409
00:19:27,952 --> 00:19:29,017
Friends.
You...

410
00:19:30,538 --> 00:19:33,205
Guys, great news
from down the hall.

411
00:19:33,207 --> 00:19:37,176
One dollar,
two bags of gummy bears!

412
00:19:38,078 --> 00:19:39,378
It's like, I don't even care

413
00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:41,463
what happens
for the rest of the day.

414
00:19:41,465 --> 00:19:43,082
I...

415
00:19:43,084 --> 00:19:44,583
Hey.

416
00:19:44,585 --> 00:19:46,034
Well, guys, uh...

417
00:19:47,538 --> 00:19:48,754
I'm a dad.

418
00:19:48,756 --> 00:19:50,038
Oh, my God!

419
00:19:52,593 --> 00:19:54,710
Everybody,

420
00:19:54,712 --> 00:19:56,895
this is Marvin.

421
00:19:56,897 --> 00:19:59,615
We named him after my pop.

422
00:20:00,850 --> 00:20:02,768
Tell them the
full name.

423
00:20:02,770 --> 00:20:06,939
Marvin Wait For It Eriksen.

424
00:20:06,941 --> 00:20:09,992
That is the coolest
middle name of all-time.

425
00:20:09,994 --> 00:20:11,710
Totally.

426
00:20:13,079 --> 00:20:16,865
? You were born into
a strange world ?

427
00:20:16,867 --> 00:20:20,002
? Like a candle, you were meant
to share the fire ?

428
00:20:20,004 --> 00:20:23,739
? I don't know where we come
from, I don't know where we go ?

429
00:20:23,741 --> 00:20:26,041
? But my arms were made
to hold you ?

430
00:20:26,043 --> 00:20:27,909
? So I will never let you go ?

431
00:20:27,911 --> 00:20:31,246
? 'Cause you were born ?

432
00:20:31,248 --> 00:20:34,516
? To change this life,
you were born. ?

00:20:59,686 --> 00:21:01,436
<i>Which brings us to the story</i>

437
00:21:01,438 --> 00:21:04,089
<i>of a wedding day</i>
<i>that went horribly wrong.</i>

438
00:21:05,525 --> 00:21:07,225
Ted, the bride wants to see you.

439
00:21:08,361 --> 00:21:11,480
<i>Uncle Barney</i>
<i>was getting married.</i>

440
00:21:11,482 --> 00:21:14,533
How the hell did we get there?

441
00:21:18,488 --> 00:21:19,654
I love the name Marvin.

442
00:21:19,656 --> 00:21:20,989
Marv.

443
00:21:20,991 --> 00:21:23,108
Sounds like a little
middle-aged man.

444
00:21:23,944 --> 00:21:25,043
Golf next
weekend, Marv?

445
00:21:25,045 --> 00:21:26,712
How's that tax report
coming, Marv?

446
00:21:26,714 --> 00:21:28,446
At your age,
erectile dysfunction

447
00:21:28,448 --> 00:21:30,582
is nothing to be
ashamed of, Marv.

448
00:21:32,051 --> 00:21:34,119
<i>It was a beautiful moment.</i>

449
00:21:34,121 --> 00:21:36,471
<i>But then a thought popped</i>
<i>into my head, kids.</i>

450
00:21:36,473 --> 00:21:38,423
The same thought that will pop
<i>into your heads</i>

451
00:21:38,425 --> 00:21:41,476
<i>the first time you see your</i>
<i>best friend holding their baby.</i>

452
00:21:43,230 --> 00:21:45,480
Wonder how much this would hurt.

453
00:21:49,853 --> 00:21:51,953
<i>That guy's a dad.</i>

454
00:21:54,908 --> 00:21:56,942
Oh, I think he's hungry.

455
00:21:56,944 --> 00:21:59,194
Oh, we'll give
you some privacy.

456
00:22:01,147 --> 00:22:03,331
Wow. Seeing them in there
all together like that,

457
00:22:03,333 --> 00:22:05,250
they're a family,
you know?

458
00:22:05,252 --> 00:22:06,835
That's what I want.

459
00:22:06,837 --> 00:22:09,671
Oh, Ted, I'm glad
we're friends again.

460
00:22:09,673 --> 00:22:10,756
Me, too.

461
00:22:10,758 --> 00:22:13,425
Because as your friend,
I have to tell you:

462
00:22:13,427 --> 00:22:14,593
You're full of crap!

463
00:22:14,595 --> 00:22:16,294
You say you want a family,

464
00:22:16,296 --> 00:22:18,680
you say
you want to meet "The One,"

465
00:22:18,682 --> 00:22:21,633
but you are always chasing
the wrong women.

466
00:22:21,635 --> 00:22:22,851
That is not true.

467
00:22:22,853 --> 00:22:24,186
Look at the women you date,

468
00:22:24,188 --> 00:22:25,520
starting with me:

469
00:22:25,522 --> 00:22:27,656
I told you right away
I didn't want marriage or kids.

470
00:22:27,658 --> 00:22:31,276
Stella had a child with another
man who she still loved.

471
00:22:31,278 --> 00:22:34,963
Zoey was married and trying
to sabotage your career

472
00:22:34,965 --> 00:22:37,199
and wore a lot of stupid hats.

473
00:22:37,201 --> 00:22:39,651
If you really wanted a family,

474
00:22:39,653 --> 00:22:41,653
you would stop pursuing women

475
00:22:41,655 --> 00:22:43,488
you know that
there is no future with.

476
00:22:43,490 --> 00:22:48,210
Okay, first of all,
hats were in that year, kind of.

477
00:22:48,212 --> 00:22:50,495
Secondly, I don't
always choose women

478
00:22:50,497 --> 00:22:53,215
there's no future with, kind of.

479
00:22:53,217 --> 00:22:54,800
Name one exception.

480
00:22:54,802 --> 00:22:57,002
Victoria.

481
00:22:57,004 --> 00:22:59,370
<i>Victoria was great.</i>

482
00:22:59,372 --> 00:23:01,306
Exactly,
and you threw it all away

483
00:23:01,308 --> 00:23:03,592
to chase after some hot piece
of ass.

484
00:23:03,594 --> 00:23:06,061
You mean you?
Thank you!

485
00:23:06,063 --> 00:23:09,231
Victoria is the only
woman you've dated

486
00:23:09,233 --> 00:23:10,632
who could've been "The One."

487
00:23:10,634 --> 00:23:11,900
You should call her.

488
00:23:11,902 --> 00:23:15,386
Tiny thing, last time I saw her,
she was getting engaged.

489
00:23:15,388 --> 00:23:16,538
That was eight months ago.

490
00:23:16,540 --> 00:23:18,073
For all you know,
she's single again.

491
00:23:18,075 --> 00:23:19,074
What if she's married?

492
00:23:19,076 --> 00:23:20,108
What if she's not?

493
00:23:20,110 --> 00:23:21,576
Then you would actually
have a chance

494
00:23:21,578 --> 00:23:24,362
to get what you say you want,
and it terrifies you.

495
00:23:24,364 --> 00:23:27,666
Why? Because if I stole a
scalpel and I cut you open,

496
00:23:27,668 --> 00:23:31,920
all I would find inside is a
scared, trembling pile of crap.

497
00:23:31,922 --> 00:23:34,673
See, I've missed these talks.

498
00:23:34,675 --> 00:23:36,041
Oh, me, too.

499
00:23:36,043 --> 00:23:38,510
Yeah.
Whoa.

500
00:23:38,512 --> 00:23:40,762
What's wrong?

501
00:23:40,764 --> 00:23:42,580
I ruined things with Quinn.

502
00:23:42,582 --> 00:23:44,599
I insisted she stop stripping,

503
00:23:44,601 --> 00:23:46,551
we got in a huge fight about it,

504
00:23:46,553 --> 00:23:49,771
then I ran off to Atlantic City
for two days without calling.

505
00:23:49,773 --> 00:23:52,390
What the hell
am I coming home to?

506
00:23:55,862 --> 00:23:58,930
Let's have an eight-way with
my six hottest stripper friends.

507
00:23:58,932 --> 00:24:01,032
Um, how is that a punishment?

508
00:24:01,034 --> 00:24:02,234
Wait for it.

509
00:24:02,236 --> 00:24:03,618
But I forbid you from filming it

510
00:24:03,620 --> 00:24:04,819
with your overhead camera

511
00:24:04,821 --> 00:24:06,955
that zooms in
on whoever's being the loudest.

512
00:24:08,157 --> 00:24:12,244
Nooooo!

513
00:24:12,246 --> 00:24:14,579
No, that's too cruel.

514
00:24:14,581 --> 00:24:18,567
Or, you know,
maybe Quinn's moved out.

515
00:24:19,552 --> 00:24:22,254
I didn't even think of that!

516
00:24:27,793 --> 00:24:29,144
Hi.

517
00:24:30,730 --> 00:24:32,230
Welcome home.

518
00:24:32,232 --> 00:24:36,184
I decided the place was a bit
too "American Psycho" for me,

519
00:24:36,186 --> 00:24:38,803
so while you were gone,
I hired a decorator

520
00:24:38,805 --> 00:24:39,804
and I asked him,

521
00:24:39,806 --> 00:24:41,072
"What would the inside

522
00:24:41,074 --> 00:24:43,325
of Tinkerbell's vagina
look like?"

523
00:24:43,327 --> 00:24:45,594
And the kid just ran with it!

524
00:24:46,779 --> 00:24:49,281
So... what do you think?

525
00:24:49,283 --> 00:24:52,951
Thank God you're still here!

526
00:24:56,488 --> 00:24:58,673
Welcome home.

527
00:25:01,944 --> 00:25:04,346
<i>Lily and Marshall asked Robin</i>
<i>to be the photographer</i>

528
00:25:04,348 --> 00:25:06,831
<i>for Baby Marvin's</i>
<i>Birth Announcement card</i>

529
00:25:06,833 --> 00:25:08,633
<i>instead of me.</i>

530
00:25:08,635 --> 00:25:09,634
<i>Whatever.</i>

531
00:25:09,636 --> 00:25:10,969
<i>The only problem?</i>

532
00:25:18,761 --> 00:25:20,278
These are terrible, Robin!

533
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:22,251
Hey, it is not easy
getting a good shot

534
00:25:22,276 --> 00:25:23,899
cooped up in this apartment!

535
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:25,016
See, two different styles:

536
00:25:25,018 --> 00:25:28,853
I make compositions,
Robin makes excuses.

537
00:25:28,855 --> 00:25:29,854
Click!

538
00:25:29,856 --> 00:25:31,189
Photo burn!

539
00:25:31,191 --> 00:25:33,124
Okay. How about this?

540
00:25:33,126 --> 00:25:35,627
Tomorrow, we go
to Central Park at sunset

541
00:25:35,629 --> 00:25:38,546
and we get the perfect picture
in the perfect setting.

542
00:25:38,548 --> 00:25:40,048
Oh, I like that.

543
00:25:40,050 --> 00:25:42,917
It'll be Marvin's first
outing into the world.

544
00:25:42,919 --> 00:25:44,586
You're gonna love
the park, buddy.

545
00:25:44,588 --> 00:25:46,638
It's a great place
to meet chicks.

546
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:48,923
Or-or dudes.

547
00:25:48,925 --> 00:25:50,175
Or both.

548
00:25:50,177 --> 00:25:52,560
Oh, we love you
no matter what!

549
00:25:52,562 --> 00:25:56,164
<i>And kids, as I watched your</i>
<i>Aunt Lily hold her baby boy,</i>

550
00:25:56,166 --> 00:25:58,199
<i>another thought</i>
<i>popped into my head.</i>

551
00:25:58,201 --> 00:26:00,602
Even though you
didn't buy anything,

552
00:26:00,604 --> 00:26:03,021
I want to thank you
for coming in.

553
00:26:03,023 --> 00:26:04,322
Here's a free teddy bear.

554
00:26:04,324 --> 00:26:06,391
What are you gonna
name the little guy?

555
00:26:06,393 --> 00:26:09,494
Six Pack.

556
00:26:12,114 --> 00:26:14,032
Gun it, bitches!

557
00:26:14,985 --> 00:26:16,785
<i>That girl's a mom!</i>

558
00:26:23,376 --> 00:26:26,127
Okay, so I met this girl
on the train,

559
00:26:26,129 --> 00:26:28,179
and I texted her, "What's up""

560
00:26:28,181 --> 00:26:31,099
She texted,
"Hey," exclamation point.

561
00:26:31,101 --> 00:26:33,852
Does that mean,
"Ask me out" or "Just..."

562
00:26:33,854 --> 00:26:38,306
Ted, we are responsible for
a whole other human life now,

563
00:26:38,308 --> 00:26:43,261
so new rule: You can't come
to us with any issue unless

564
00:26:43,286 --> 00:26:44,313
it's an "8" or higher.

565
00:26:44,314 --> 00:26:45,647
Got it.

566
00:26:45,649 --> 00:26:48,733
So I'm thinking of texting
back a winky smiley face.

567
00:26:48,735 --> 00:26:50,568
Eight or higher, bro.

568
00:26:50,570 --> 00:26:51,569
Well, no, what should I--

569
00:26:51,571 --> 00:26:52,821
Eight or higher, bro.

570
00:26:52,823 --> 00:26:54,155
No, yeah,
I'm just wondering if--

571
00:26:54,157 --> 00:26:55,907
Eight or higher, bro.

572
00:26:55,909 --> 00:26:57,826
Well, where do you rate this?

573
00:26:57,828 --> 00:27:01,246
This is the same as what's in
little Marvin's pants right now:

574
00:27:01,248 --> 00:27:03,064
a soft two.

575
00:27:05,868 --> 00:27:07,552
Sorry, bro.

576
00:27:07,554 --> 00:27:10,939
Stop texting the bimbo
and call Victoria.

577
00:27:10,941 --> 00:27:12,257
That chapter's over.

578
00:27:12,259 --> 00:27:14,125
W-We just weren't destined
to be together.

579
00:27:14,127 --> 00:27:19,314
"Destined." Aren't you tired
of waiting for destiny, Ted?

580
00:27:19,316 --> 00:27:22,300
Isn't it time
to make your own destiny?

581
00:27:23,769 --> 00:27:25,136
Hey, false alarm.

582
00:27:25,138 --> 00:27:27,939
What I was smelling was
the previous poop,

583
00:27:27,941 --> 00:27:31,014
which, apparently, is
still somewhere on my

584
00:27:31,039 --> 00:27:33,039
clothes and/or in my hair.

585
00:27:33,979 --> 00:27:36,247
Hold him, would you?
Oh. Here.

586
00:27:38,951 --> 00:27:40,702
Ooh.
Yeah, smart.

587
00:27:42,322 --> 00:27:46,908
Oh, sure, that one
turns out great. Ugh.

588
00:27:46,910 --> 00:27:49,761
- And then another thought popped-

589
00:27:49,763 --> 00:27:52,997
<i>That guy's nowhere</i>
<i>near being a dad.</i>

590
00:27:58,838 --> 00:28:00,171
Hello?

591
00:28:00,173 --> 00:28:03,358
Hey, Victoria, it's Ted.

592
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:05,276
Um, listen, I was just wondering

593
00:28:05,278 --> 00:28:08,513
if you wanted to catch up
sometime; it's been a while.

594
00:28:08,515 --> 00:28:09,814
That sounds nice.

595
00:28:09,816 --> 00:28:12,450
I'm actually around
this afternoon.

596
00:28:12,452 --> 00:28:15,453
Oh, wow, uh, great.

597
00:28:15,455 --> 00:28:17,238
MacLaren's at 2:00?

598
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:19,040
Is 1:30 okay?

599
00:28:19,042 --> 00:28:20,658
I might have a thing later.

600
00:28:20,660 --> 00:28:23,027
Yeah. Yeah. See you then.

601
00:28:23,029 --> 00:28:24,546
See you then.

602
00:28:24,548 --> 00:28:27,415
<i>Meanwhile, Barney</i>
<i>and Quinn were off to Hawaii</i>

603
00:28:27,417 --> 00:28:29,534
<i>for their first getaway</i>
<i>as a couple.</i>

604
00:28:29,536 --> 00:28:31,753
Ma'am, I need you
to open your suitcase.

605
00:28:31,755 --> 00:28:33,154
It's mine.

606
00:28:33,156 --> 00:28:35,423
Did you have
to replace my luggage, too?

607
00:28:35,425 --> 00:28:38,726
Run away on me again, you'll
be wearing hot pink stilettos.

608
00:28:38,728 --> 00:28:41,179
What's that?

609
00:28:41,181 --> 00:28:42,230
Yeah, what is that?

610
00:28:42,232 --> 00:28:44,065
It's a magic trick.

611
00:28:44,067 --> 00:28:46,717
You see, I'm something
of a magician.

612
00:28:46,719 --> 00:28:47,718
Open the box, sir.

613
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:50,104
Oh, I can't do that.

614
00:28:52,392 --> 00:28:54,042
Sir, are there drugs
in that box?

615
00:28:54,044 --> 00:28:56,194
Oh, no. He's probably
just barking

616
00:28:56,196 --> 00:28:57,495
because of the explosives.

617
00:28:57,497 --> 00:28:59,831
Oh, my God!

618
00:28:59,833 --> 00:29:01,966
Tell us what's
in the box right now!

619
00:29:01,968 --> 00:29:03,284
I can't.

620
00:29:03,286 --> 00:29:05,687
Magician's Code.

621
00:29:06,956 --> 00:29:10,625
<i>Okay, I need to figure out</i>
<i>if Victoria ever got engaged.</i>

622
00:29:10,627 --> 00:29:14,579
<i>I'll have to very subtly</i>
<i>check for an engagement ring.</i>

623
00:29:16,248 --> 00:29:19,384
<i>Hmm, can't see the left hand.</i>

624
00:29:24,663 --> 00:29:26,125
Open the box now!

625
00:29:26,810 --> 00:29:28,360
I can't.

626
00:29:28,362 --> 00:29:29,611
Magician's Code.

627
00:29:29,613 --> 00:29:32,531
What the hell is
the Magician's Code?!

628
00:29:32,533 --> 00:29:35,050
"A magician never
reveals his tricks."

629
00:29:35,052 --> 00:29:37,035
Mr. Flanagan, my magic mentor

630
00:29:37,037 --> 00:29:39,705
from the hallowed
Staten Island Mall Magic Shop,

631
00:29:39,707 --> 00:29:42,074
taught me the importance
of the Code

632
00:29:42,076 --> 00:29:44,242
one fateful autumn
night in 1993.

633
00:29:44,244 --> 00:29:46,118
Always good to tell
a long story while people

634
00:29:46,143 --> 00:29:47,664
are aiming guns at you.

635
00:29:47,665 --> 00:29:50,782
'Twas a night which
would changed my life...

636
00:29:53,053 --> 00:29:55,754
Hello? Mr. Flanagan.

637
00:29:55,756 --> 00:29:58,473
Wh-What are you doing here?

638
00:29:58,475 --> 00:30:01,677
Um...
I'm checking up on you.

639
00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:04,980
Just to make sure
you're practicing your craft

640
00:30:04,982 --> 00:30:06,231
or whatever.

641
00:30:06,233 --> 00:30:08,850
That is an honor, sir.

642
00:30:08,852 --> 00:30:11,486
And yeah, I promise,
I'm practicing.

643
00:30:11,488 --> 00:30:12,854
But wait.

644
00:30:12,856 --> 00:30:14,990
Why were you, why were you
going in my mom's room?

645
00:30:14,992 --> 00:30:18,193
Uh... your mom's actually
helping me with a new trick.

646
00:30:18,195 --> 00:30:19,945
That is so cool!

647
00:30:19,947 --> 00:30:21,146
What is this trick?

648
00:30:21,148 --> 00:30:22,497
Is it sawing a lady in half?

649
00:30:23,917 --> 00:30:25,283
Well, not sawing.

650
00:30:25,285 --> 00:30:26,485
But actually,

651
00:30:26,487 --> 00:30:27,786
the Magician's Code forbids me

652
00:30:27,788 --> 00:30:30,488
from telling you anything else
about the trick.

653
00:30:30,490 --> 00:30:32,958
Wayne, come back to bed!

654
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:34,876
Okay, it involves a bed.

655
00:30:34,878 --> 00:30:38,013
W-W-Wait. Can
you at least

656
00:30:38,015 --> 00:30:39,648
tell me the name of this trick?

657
00:30:39,650 --> 00:30:42,000
Sure, kid.

658
00:30:42,002 --> 00:30:43,351
It's called--

659
00:30:43,353 --> 00:30:45,487
The Disappearing Salami.

660
00:30:46,505 --> 00:30:48,590
Mr. Flanagan's wife shot him

661
00:30:48,592 --> 00:30:51,493
before he could ever tell me
what the trick was.

662
00:30:51,495 --> 00:30:52,915
Yeah, that guy was
banging your mom.

663
00:30:52,989 --> 00:30:53,812
Yup.

664
00:30:53,814 --> 00:30:54,946
Totally.

665
00:30:54,948 --> 00:30:57,032
Mr. Flanagan was not ban--

666
00:30:57,034 --> 00:30:59,034
Oh, my God, he was.

667
00:30:59,036 --> 00:31:02,370
Wait, why are you bringing
a magic trick to Hawaii anyway?

668
00:31:02,372 --> 00:31:05,824
I was hoping to shoot up
to Honolulu

669
00:31:05,826 --> 00:31:07,793
for the Worldwide
Magic Convention.

670
00:31:07,795 --> 00:31:09,694
Don't worry. You'll
notice I was gone.

671
00:31:09,696 --> 00:31:11,696
It's only three
14-hour days.

672
00:31:11,698 --> 00:31:13,381
So on our romantic getaway

673
00:31:13,383 --> 00:31:16,134
to help me forget about
you skipping town on me,

674
00:31:16,136 --> 00:31:17,836
you're skipping town on me?!

675
00:31:17,838 --> 00:31:21,372
Look Quinn, you're
very important to me,

676
00:31:21,374 --> 00:31:26,544
but you're sharing my heart
with an equally important Miss.

677
00:31:26,546 --> 00:31:30,482
Miss...

678
00:31:30,484 --> 00:31:32,484
Direction.

679
00:31:32,486 --> 00:31:33,652
What?

680
00:31:34,821 --> 00:31:35,821
H...

681
00:31:35,823 --> 00:31:37,572
Shoot him.

682
00:31:37,574 --> 00:31:40,225
So what did you order?

683
00:31:40,227 --> 00:31:42,611
Oh, just black coffee.

684
00:31:42,613 --> 00:31:43,829
I like it that way, too.

685
00:31:43,831 --> 00:31:45,413
Yeah, it just tastes
better to me.

686
00:31:45,415 --> 00:31:47,199
I find that if the coffee beans
are good enough,

687
00:31:47,201 --> 00:31:49,901
you really don't need--
Why are you in a wedding dress?!

688
00:31:49,903 --> 00:31:53,404
Well, I'm sort of supposed to...

689
00:31:53,406 --> 00:31:56,124
get married today.

690
00:31:56,126 --> 00:31:57,742
All your friends and family
are waiting for you

691
00:31:57,744 --> 00:31:58,927
in some church right now?

692
00:31:58,929 --> 00:32:02,631
Well, not all; we had
five last-minute no-shows.

693
00:32:02,633 --> 00:32:04,082
Well... six.

694
00:32:05,301 --> 00:32:06,885
Mazel tov, Ted.

695
00:32:06,887 --> 00:32:09,387
I was starting to think
this would never happen.

696
00:32:09,389 --> 00:32:10,472
Oh, no, Mrs. Matsen--

697
00:32:10,474 --> 00:32:12,390
I told
you he wasn't gay.

698
00:32:12,392 --> 00:32:14,092
Wait, what?

699
00:32:15,862 --> 00:32:17,979
I was tempted to leave Klaus
for you last fall.

700
00:32:17,981 --> 00:32:21,316
The only thing holding me back
was the Robin of it all.

701
00:32:21,318 --> 00:32:24,435
I know, and you were right,
but... but that's all over now.

702
00:32:24,437 --> 00:32:27,906
She moved out-- I mean, we're
still friends, but that's over.

703
00:32:27,908 --> 00:32:31,726
All these years, I never stopped
thinking about you, Ted.

704
00:32:32,745 --> 00:32:34,663
I've got a car outside

705
00:32:34,665 --> 00:32:38,300
if you're ready to drive off
into the sunset together.

706
00:32:39,669 --> 00:32:43,004
But if you don't feel
the same way,

707
00:32:43,006 --> 00:32:45,957
if you've closed the door on us,

708
00:32:45,959 --> 00:32:47,676
just say the word...

709
00:32:47,678 --> 00:32:49,227
and I'll go.

710
00:32:50,763 --> 00:32:52,097
Barney, tell them the trick.

711
00:32:52,099 --> 00:32:54,733
The only person I could possibly
reveal the trick to

712
00:32:54,735 --> 00:32:55,767
is another magician.

713
00:32:55,769 --> 00:32:59,304
Well, I'm a magician.

714
00:32:59,306 --> 00:33:01,072
Prove it.

715
00:33:07,479 --> 00:33:08,530
Whoo-hoo!

716
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:19,341
<i>That's Barney's version.</i>

717
00:33:19,343 --> 00:33:21,343
<i>Quinn said it was</i>
<i>a simple card trick.</i>

718
00:33:21,345 --> 00:33:24,012
<i>Who's to say which</i>
<i>version was true?</i>

719
00:33:24,014 --> 00:33:25,847
<i>Quinn's.</i>
<i>Quinn's version was true.</i>

720
00:33:27,700 --> 00:33:29,017
Okay.

721
00:33:29,019 --> 00:33:31,219
I'll tell you.

722
00:33:33,289 --> 00:33:36,024
Oh, that's really cool.

723
00:33:36,976 --> 00:33:38,777
So what's the trick?

724
00:33:38,779 --> 00:33:40,829
I can't say.
Magician's Code.

725
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:43,681
Ta-da...

726
00:33:43,683 --> 00:33:45,984
da-da-da-da-da-da.

727
00:33:47,904 --> 00:33:48,904
Hello.

728
00:33:48,906 --> 00:33:51,623
Why did you make me
call Victoria?

729
00:33:51,625 --> 00:33:53,208
She's here in a wedding dress.

730
00:33:53,210 --> 00:33:55,543
I'm the verge of
ruining a wedding!

731
00:33:55,545 --> 00:33:56,912
And Mrs. Madsen's friend
thinks I'm gay,

732
00:33:56,914 --> 00:33:58,496
but let's put a pin
in that till later.

733
00:33:58,498 --> 00:34:00,665
Oh, my God.
Victoria's at the bar with Ted.

734
00:34:00,667 --> 00:34:02,167
That's a seven.

735
00:34:02,169 --> 00:34:03,802
And she's in a wedding dress.

736
00:34:04,670 --> 00:34:05,720
That's a ten.

737
00:34:05,722 --> 00:34:07,889
We got a ten!

738
00:34:09,041 --> 00:34:11,209
What are you gonna do?
Where is she right now?

739
00:34:11,211 --> 00:34:12,677
So this dress, what's the cut?

740
00:34:12,679 --> 00:34:14,763
Are we talking princess,
ball gown, column?

741
00:34:14,765 --> 00:34:18,266
Right, 'cause it's a federal
crime to love weddings.

742
00:34:18,268 --> 00:34:19,768
She's in the bathroom,
which I guess

743
00:34:19,770 --> 00:34:22,487
takes forever with that
giant poufy skirt thing.

744
00:34:22,489 --> 00:34:24,739
Ball gown. Thank you.

745
00:34:24,741 --> 00:34:25,824
Four shots of tequila.

746
00:34:25,826 --> 00:34:27,242
Ted, calm down.

747
00:34:27,244 --> 00:34:29,160
Or not. This is your chance
to get the one who got away.

748
00:34:29,162 --> 00:34:30,695
You want her,
she wants you,

749
00:34:30,697 --> 00:34:32,080
what's the problem?

750
00:34:32,082 --> 00:34:34,666
The problem is Victoria's in
the middle of a giant freak-out.

751
00:34:34,668 --> 00:34:36,734
What if she winds up
regretting this decision?

752
00:34:36,736 --> 00:34:38,753
She's going after Ted Mosby.

753
00:34:38,755 --> 00:34:40,939
That's the best decision
she's ever made.

754
00:34:40,941 --> 00:34:42,757
There you go.

755
00:34:47,997 --> 00:34:50,281
Whoa. What was that?
What?

756
00:34:50,283 --> 00:34:52,684
You said you wanted a picture
of Baby Marvin's first outing.

757
00:34:53,552 --> 00:34:56,187
Our baby's first outing

758
00:34:56,189 --> 00:34:57,422
was to a bar.

759
00:34:58,525 --> 00:35:01,226
I dribble Cuervo
on Marv's soft spot.

760
00:35:01,228 --> 00:35:02,027
Here she comes! Quick!

761
00:35:02,029 --> 00:35:03,428
Oh, yeah.

762
00:35:03,430 --> 00:35:04,762
Eggshell or cream?

763
00:35:04,764 --> 00:35:06,948
Is it eggshell or cream?

764
00:35:08,434 --> 00:35:09,401
So.

765
00:35:09,403 --> 00:35:12,988
You... me...
riding off into the sunset.

766
00:35:12,990 --> 00:35:14,772
Any thoughts?

767
00:35:15,607 --> 00:35:17,058
One question:

768
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:19,294
FDR or Westside Highway,

769
00:35:19,296 --> 00:35:21,046
what's the quickest
way to the sunset?

770
00:35:24,700 --> 00:35:27,802
Man, I wind up in
these rooms a lot.

771
00:35:27,804 --> 00:35:30,722
If we miss Hawaii because of
this, guess who's not doing

772
00:35:30,724 --> 00:35:32,957
The Disappearing Salami
anytime soon?

773
00:35:33,792 --> 00:35:36,728
I need to ask you both
a few questions.

774
00:35:36,730 --> 00:35:38,129
Let's start with you.

775
00:35:38,131 --> 00:35:39,130
Name?

776
00:35:39,132 --> 00:35:40,398
Quinn Garvey.

777
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:41,483
Occupation?

778
00:35:41,485 --> 00:35:43,101
Unemployed.

779
00:35:43,103 --> 00:35:44,436
Well, well, well.

780
00:35:44,438 --> 00:35:45,737
Look who's keeping secrets now.

781
00:35:45,739 --> 00:35:48,189
Sir, I'll tell you her
occupation: stripper.

782
00:35:48,191 --> 00:35:49,824
She insists she's proud of it,

783
00:35:49,826 --> 00:35:52,310
but apparently not
proud enough to tell you.

784
00:35:52,312 --> 00:35:55,914
Barney, I was going to surprise
you with this on our trip,

785
00:35:55,916 --> 00:35:58,433
but... I quit.

786
00:36:00,319 --> 00:36:02,587
You... did that for me?

787
00:36:02,589 --> 00:36:04,072
Yes.

788
00:36:04,074 --> 00:36:06,458
And now that you know
what I did for you,

789
00:36:06,460 --> 00:36:08,593
and how much I care for you,

790
00:36:08,595 --> 00:36:11,429
would you please
show him the trick?

791
00:36:15,834 --> 00:36:19,120
Sorry. Magician's Code.

792
00:36:23,342 --> 00:36:25,343
Where should we go?

793
00:36:25,345 --> 00:36:26,844
Your place?

794
00:36:26,846 --> 00:36:28,012
My place?

795
00:36:28,014 --> 00:36:29,347
We could go on my honeymoon.

796
00:36:30,850 --> 00:36:31,849
Just kidding.

797
00:36:31,851 --> 00:36:33,935
Although, it is paid for.

798
00:36:35,738 --> 00:36:37,705
I know where we should go.
Where?

799
00:36:37,707 --> 00:36:39,491
Your wedding.

800
00:36:39,493 --> 00:36:40,692
I'm taking you back.

801
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:50,789
I don't understand.

802
00:36:50,791 --> 00:36:52,090
I thought you wanted this.

803
00:36:52,092 --> 00:36:53,458
I do want this.

804
00:36:53,460 --> 00:36:56,311
I've thought about you
so many times.

805
00:36:56,313 --> 00:36:58,897
What might have been...

806
00:36:58,899 --> 00:37:01,966
But I got left at the altar,
and it nearly killed me.

807
00:37:03,436 --> 00:37:04,770
You're someone's fianc?,

808
00:37:04,772 --> 00:37:06,605
and I have to respect that.

809
00:37:07,657 --> 00:37:09,274
So let's hit a motel,
jam in a quickie,

810
00:37:09,276 --> 00:37:10,308
and get you back
to your wedding.

811
00:37:11,362 --> 00:37:13,578
It's the right thing to do.

812
00:37:14,497 --> 00:37:16,531
Some part of me
needed to hear you say

813
00:37:16,533 --> 00:37:18,500
that running away together
wasn't an option.

814
00:37:18,502 --> 00:37:21,036
And now that I know that...

815
00:37:21,038 --> 00:37:23,255
it's like I'm sobering up.

816
00:37:26,259 --> 00:37:27,376
Is there any way

817
00:37:27,378 --> 00:37:29,928
that we can just pretend
this never happened?

818
00:37:31,764 --> 00:37:33,231
This never happened.

819
00:37:38,554 --> 00:37:41,340
Mr. Flanagan wasn't
banging my mom.

820
00:37:42,341 --> 00:37:44,342
Well.

821
00:37:44,344 --> 00:37:46,144
Your flight left.

822
00:37:46,146 --> 00:37:49,481
We need to hold Mr. Stinson
for further questioning.

823
00:37:49,483 --> 00:37:51,015
But you're free to go.

824
00:37:54,037 --> 00:37:55,754
Maybe I should.

825
00:37:56,622 --> 00:37:59,241
Wait!

826
00:38:00,159 --> 00:38:01,493
I'll show you the trick.

827
00:38:05,965 --> 00:38:08,366
Sir!

828
00:38:08,368 --> 00:38:10,001
May I please have
the silk handkerchief

829
00:38:10,003 --> 00:38:11,336
in your top left breast pocket?

830
00:38:11,338 --> 00:38:13,505
Well... I don't have...

831
00:38:25,852 --> 00:38:30,221
Sim salabi ma...
sim salabi ma...

832
00:38:32,993 --> 00:38:34,493
Relax, relax,
it's part of the trick.

833
00:38:34,495 --> 00:38:36,244
How did you get that
through the X-Ray machine?

834
00:38:36,246 --> 00:38:38,029
No questions from
the audience, please!

835
00:38:51,878 --> 00:38:52,844
What is that?

836
00:38:52,846 --> 00:38:54,012
Madam, may I please have

837
00:38:54,014 --> 00:38:55,914
the key on your necklace?

838
00:38:56,682 --> 00:38:57,682
Oh!

839
00:39:04,975 --> 00:39:06,391
Is that gonna explode?

840
00:39:06,393 --> 00:39:07,759
What?

841
00:39:11,782 --> 00:39:13,315
Ahem.

842
00:39:15,536 --> 00:39:17,819
What?

843
00:39:42,228 --> 00:39:44,629
Will you marry me?

844
00:39:46,399 --> 00:39:47,566
Yes.

845
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:54,773
Come on, guys.

846
00:39:54,775 --> 00:39:57,726
We're losing the light
for Baby's Second First Outing.

847
00:40:08,020 --> 00:40:10,755
<i>I hate to say it,</i>
<i>but Robin nailed it.</i>

848
00:40:13,993 --> 00:40:16,327
Hey.
Guys, we've got something to tell you.

849
00:40:16,329 --> 00:40:18,046
Eight or higher, bro.

850
00:40:18,048 --> 00:40:19,548
We're engaged.

851
00:40:19,550 --> 00:40:22,300
That's a... that's a ten.

852
00:40:22,302 --> 00:40:24,302
We got another ten!

853
00:40:24,304 --> 00:40:25,971
Oh...
Wow, big day!

854
00:40:25,973 --> 00:40:28,390
Congratulations!
Thank you.

855
00:40:28,392 --> 00:40:30,174
How did this happen?

856
00:40:30,176 --> 00:40:32,394
Oh... magic.

857
00:40:33,679 --> 00:40:34,896
Oh.

858
00:40:34,898 --> 00:40:36,281
Uh, not to ruin the moment,

859
00:40:36,283 --> 00:40:39,568
but apparently little Marvin
is quite stunned by the news.

860
00:40:39,570 --> 00:40:42,037
Well...

861
00:40:42,039 --> 00:40:43,371
Yeah. Wow.
Yeah.

862
00:40:43,373 --> 00:40:45,540
Do you guys mind
recounting this romantic tale

863
00:40:45,542 --> 00:40:46,958
next to a Diaper Genie?

864
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:52,030
Oh, Marvin, you're about to
hear your first love story!

865
00:40:52,032 --> 00:40:53,364
Once up on a time,

866
00:40:53,366 --> 00:40:56,585
this creepy magic dude
was boning Barney's mom...

867
00:41:02,258 --> 00:41:03,925
It's our last chance
to run away together.

868
00:41:03,927 --> 00:41:04,976
Door's right there.

869
00:41:04,978 --> 00:41:06,595
Yes, we'll start a new life.

870
00:41:06,597 --> 00:41:08,063
Head for the border!
Canada!

871
00:41:08,065 --> 00:41:10,015
Eh, Mexico.
Canada sucks.

872
00:41:10,017 --> 00:41:11,816
Okay, well,
you're one-quarter Canadian,

873
00:41:11,818 --> 00:41:13,652
so by that logic
you one-quarter suck.

874
00:41:13,654 --> 00:41:15,020
I'm 100% awesome

875
00:41:15,022 --> 00:41:16,521
and you know it.

876
00:41:17,389 --> 00:41:18,990
Yeah, I do.

877
00:41:22,913 --> 00:41:26,498
Look, I-I hope this isn't weird,
or anything, because...

878
00:41:26,500 --> 00:41:28,366
Barney...

879
00:41:28,368 --> 00:41:30,869
I'm... I'm really happy for you.

880
00:41:30,871 --> 00:41:32,704
Really?

881
00:41:32,706 --> 00:41:34,372
? I listen to the wind ?

882
00:41:34,374 --> 00:41:35,257
Really.

883
00:41:35,259 --> 00:41:37,909
? To the wind of my soul ?

884
00:41:39,762 --> 00:41:41,245
? Where I'll end up
well I think ?

885
00:41:41,247 --> 00:41:45,150
? Only God really knows ?

886
00:41:47,270 --> 00:41:50,305
? I've sat upon ?

887
00:41:50,307 --> 00:41:51,806
? The setting sun ?

888
00:41:51,808 --> 00:41:54,609
? But never never never... ?

889
00:41:54,611 --> 00:41:56,778
You just drove
right by the church.

890
00:41:56,780 --> 00:41:58,596
I know.

891
00:41:58,598 --> 00:42:01,599
? I never wanted water once ?

892
00:42:01,601 --> 00:42:04,869
? No, never, never, never ?

893
00:42:12,378 --> 00:42:14,329
? I listen to my words ?

894
00:42:14,331 --> 00:42:16,865
? But they fall far below ?

895
00:42:16,867 --> 00:42:19,334
The road to this day has had

896
00:42:19,336 --> 00:42:20,952
a few twists and
turns, hasn't it?

897
00:42:20,954 --> 00:42:22,887
Yeah. Just a few.

898
00:42:22,889 --> 00:42:24,422
? My heart wants to go ?

899
00:42:24,424 --> 00:42:27,008
In a weird way, it all makes
sense, though, doesn't it?

900
00:42:27,010 --> 00:42:29,060
Yeah.

901
00:42:29,062 --> 00:42:30,345
Yeah, it kind of does.

902
00:42:30,347 --> 00:42:33,131
? ...the devil's lake ?

903
00:42:33,133 --> 00:42:35,317
? But never never ?

904
00:42:35,319 --> 00:42:37,185
? Never never ?

905
00:42:37,187 --> 00:42:39,303
The bride wants to see me?

906
00:42:39,305 --> 00:42:41,272
? No, never, never, never. ?

907
00:42:41,274 --> 00:42:45,274
