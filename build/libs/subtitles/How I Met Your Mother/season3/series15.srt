1
00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:04,080
Kids,the spring of 2008 was a pretty great time for me

2
00:00:04,550 --> 00:00:05,990
Stella and I had started dating,

3
00:00:06,090 --> 00:00:07,580
And I'd just gotten a big raise at work,

4
00:00:07,660 --> 00:00:09,200
So I decided to purchase something I knew

5
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:10,800
Would be the envy of all my friends.

6
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:12,600
A new car!

7
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:15,560
Ted, this is new york city-- you're never gonna drive it.

8
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:17,730
This is a really, really stupid purchase,

9
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:21,200
And I'm sorry, but none of us can support it.

10
00:00:21,260 --> 00:00:22,400
Shotgun for eternity!

11
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:23,800
You can't call shotgun for eternity.

12
00:00:23,860 --> 00:00:25,000
I just called it.

13
00:00:25,060 --> 00:00:27,000
You can't just call things, barney.

14
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:28,200
I call that I can call things!

15
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:29,200
hey, baby.

16
00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:31,500
Beer.

17
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:33,830
Are you okay?

18
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:36,960
Beer.

19
00:00:42,730 --> 00:00:44,160
Okay, what happened?

20
00:00:44,230 --> 00:00:46,730
They always told me that working at a big law firm

21
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:48,260
Was like being at war.

22
00:00:48,330 --> 00:00:49,700
You get out of law school,

23
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:51,330
It's like getting out of boot camp.

24
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:53,430
That first day at work, you're storming the beaches,

25
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:55,200
Full of piss and vinegar...

26
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:56,900
Dude, we're lawyers now.

27
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:58,100
Totally.

28
00:00:58,160 --> 00:00:59,460
We've got briefcases and everything.

29
00:00:59,530 --> 00:01:01,030
Freakin' briefcases.

30
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:02,460
You have anything in yours?

31
00:01:02,530 --> 00:01:03,930
Totally empty. you?

32
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,100
Candy bars.

33
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:11,730
Then you get in the trenches side by side with your buddies

34
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:13,600
And you feel a sense of camaraderie.

35
00:01:13,660 --> 00:01:15,130
But before too long...

36
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,260
Hey, marshall.

37
00:01:16,330 --> 00:01:17,300
...the shells start to fall.

38
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:18,560
Hello, arthur.

39
00:01:19,930 --> 00:01:21,430
Arthur hobbes is one of the senior partners

40
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:23,860
At my firm, and he's... he's my boss.

41
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:26,060
He seems like a nice guy,

42
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:27,230
But he's got a nickname...

43
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:29,930
Artillery arthur.

44
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,500
How's your morning going?

45
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:33,400
It's going fine-- how is yours?

46
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:34,930
Not too bad, not too bad.

47
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Hey, is ferguson in yet?

48
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:39,060
He is, he's in... just in his office next door.

49
00:01:39,130 --> 00:01:41,300
That's great-- have a good one, buddy.

50
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:42,560
You, too.

51
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:46,300
You never know who's gonna get hit...

52
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:47,760
Hey, ferguson!

53
00:01:47,830 --> 00:01:50,260
I read your report, and it's complete crap!

54
00:01:50,330 --> 00:01:52,300
No, you know what? that's an insult to crap.

55
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:55,760
If crap could eat and then crap stuff out, it's that!

56
00:01:55,830 --> 00:01:59,360
Your report is the crap that crap craps!

57
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:02,000
If you last two more days here, I'll be shocked!

58
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:03,200
Shocked!

59
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:06,900
It was brutal,

60
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,030
But the worst was a few minutes later.

61
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,130
Did you hear that?

62
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,860
Yeah, sorry.

63
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:17,360
Can you believe he did that

64
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:19,930
On take your daughter to work day?

65
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:25,230
So that brings us to today.

66
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:26,700
Oh, no.

67
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:27,800
A little background.

68
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:29,300
So I'm working on this report

69
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:32,830
Called "using 23-b-3 spurious class action precedent

70
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:34,830
"to contest a class certification order

71
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:37,330
Based on a lack of commonality, numerosity..."

72
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,630
Dude, you lost us.

73
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:39,760
Can't you just call it something cool

74
00:02:39,830 --> 00:02:40,960
Like "the ninja report"?

75
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:43,860
Okay. yeah, fine, whatever.

76
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:45,030
Um, so I'm supposed

77
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:46,460
To turn in "the ninja report" yesterday.

78
00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:48,130
-Awesome. -wow. cool.

79
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:50,660
But I got insanely busy with other stuff,

80
00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:52,760
I didn't get a chance to finish it,

81
00:02:52,830 --> 00:02:54,630
And then this morning...

82
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:56,130
-Hey, ferguson. -hey, arthur.

83
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:57,460
How's your day going?

84
00:02:57,530 --> 00:02:59,600
-I gotta go. -great. how is yours?

85
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:01,300
Great, great-- hey, is marshall in yet?

86
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:03,000
Oh, thank god.

87
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:05,400
Yeah, he's right in there.

88
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:07,000
Fantastic. have a good one, buddy.

89
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,100
And then...

90
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:13,600
He screamed at me.

91
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:15,760
Oh, baby, I'm so sorry.

92
00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:17,400
What, that's it?

93
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:20,660
You're upset because a guy talked loudly near you?

94
00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:22,160
Barney, I have never been screamed at

95
00:03:22,230 --> 00:03:23,830
Like that in my life.

96
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:26,030
Come on, when's the last time you got screamed at at work?

97
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:27,960
I got screamed at three times today.

98
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:29,300
Once in korean.

99
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:32,430
This is corporate america, marshall.

100
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:34,230
Screaming is a motivational tool,

101
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:36,600
Like christmas bonuses or sexual harassment.

102
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:38,760
It's just good business.

103
00:03:38,830 --> 00:03:41,930
Oh, baby, it's just not fair.

104
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
You've been working so hard.

105
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:47,330
Late nights, weekends.

106
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:49,530
I never see you.

107
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:54,630
We've barely made love in weeks.

108
00:03:58,260 --> 00:04:00,860
It's bad, guys,mama needs her sugar.

109
00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:04,300
Look, marshall, he screamed at you, you took it.

110
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:05,930
He probably respects you more for it.

111
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,030
Yeah, about that...

112
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:13,130
So arthur's busy giving me the full screaming treatment...

113
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:16,360
Face turning red,

114
00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:19,000
Vein in his forehead about to burst,

115
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:22,630
Spittle flying like shrapnel.

116
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:24,230
Everyone you work with walking by your office,

117
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:26,830
Peering in.

118
00:04:30,030 --> 00:04:33,330
And suddenly, I just felt all of it.

119
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:34,500
All of what?

120
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:35,930
All of it.

121
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,600
The fact that I became a lawyer to save the environment,

122
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:40,730
And now I'm working for the bad guys instead.

123
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:43,530
The fact that I am stuck in this job

124
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,200
Because of a mortgage I can barely afford

125
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:47,130
On an apartment that is crooked.

126
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,560
The fact that I am a grown man,

127
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:51,260
and nobody, not even artillery arthur,

128
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,160
Has the right to talk to me like that!

129
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:57,000
I begged my body not to do it.

130
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:00,230
But it was no use.

131
00:05:06,330 --> 00:05:09,500
I just... I just...

132
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:17,630
Just because you weren't around for this,

133
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:20,060
I called shotgun for all eternity in ted's car.

134
00:05:36,230 --> 00:05:39,860
dude I can't believe you cried in front of your boss.

135
00:05:39,930 --> 00:05:41,360
I don't know what happened.

136
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:43,300
There's just something about being yelled at like that,

137
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:46,060
Like I was being scolded by my dad.

138
00:05:46,130 --> 00:05:48,730
Suddenly... suddenly I was a little boy.

139
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:51,230
Is "boy" the right word?

140
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:54,100
I felt absolutely powerless.

141
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:57,230
Flaccid-- hell, i... I felt castrated.

142
00:05:57,300 --> 00:05:58,800
God, you're hot right now.

143
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:02,230
And the worst thing is, tomorrow morning I have to walk

144
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:04,600
Into arthur's office and give him the ninja report.

145
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:06,730
Ooh. ooh. ninjas are cool.

146
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:09,260
How the hell am I supposed to face this guy again?

147
00:06:09,330 --> 00:06:12,000
Here's what I would do if I were you.

148
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,730
Hi, arthur.

149
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,100
Hello, marshall.

150
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:18,060
Have you finally finished the ninja report?

151
00:06:18,130 --> 00:06:20,100
Yeah, I got it.

152
00:06:20,830 --> 00:06:21,930
Right here.

153
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:26,660
I think it's gonna blow you away.

154
00:06:26,730 --> 00:06:29,730
Please, I have a family.

155
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:31,600
So we good?

156
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:33,100
We're so good.

157
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:35,530
Then why are you still in my office?

158
00:06:41,230 --> 00:06:43,960
Okay, gun violence might be the answer to everything

159
00:06:44,030 --> 00:06:45,900
Up in canada, robin,

160
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:49,160
But here in america, we solve our problems with words.

161
00:06:49,230 --> 00:06:52,000
Marshall, you go in and you dazzle this guy

162
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:54,860
With a big eloquent speech defending human dignity.

163
00:06:54,930 --> 00:06:56,500
Like abraham lincoln.

164
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:59,900
Yeah, because it's so easy just to bust out a big,

165
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:02,130
Eloquent speech off the top of your head.

166
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:04,160
Observe.

167
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:05,460
Arthur?

168
00:07:05,530 --> 00:07:06,530
What do you want, marshall?

169
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:09,030
Justice, sir.

170
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:11,300
You see, we are all born with certain incontrovertible rights,

171
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:13,300
The most fundamentally paramount of which

172
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:15,700
Is the right...

173
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:17,860
Wait, you can't be fundamentally paramount.

174
00:07:17,930 --> 00:07:19,600
One means highest, one means lowest.

175
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:21,700
You are nailing this.

176
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:23,630
Human beings have rights,

177
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:26,730
And those rights are, um...

178
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,900
You got me hooked, reel me in.

179
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,660
There are certain justices

180
00:07:30,730 --> 00:07:32,630
That cannot or will not

181
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:36,000
Be inalienable... as such...

182
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:37,460
For the future.

183
00:07:37,530 --> 00:07:39,730
Stuck the landing-- bravo!

184
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:40,730
Thank you.

185
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:45,560
Security's gonna rough you up a bit on t way out.

186
00:07:48,730 --> 00:07:51,630
Guys, guys, this is not helping, okay?

187
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:54,100
I can't have some big confrontation with arthur.

188
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:56,760
I need this job, i... I need the money.

189
00:07:56,830 --> 00:07:58,900
Yeah, but how good would it feel to walk in there tomorrow,

190
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:00,000
Tell him off and then quit?

191
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:01,430
It's great to fantasize about,

192
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:03,500
But nobody ever actually does it.

193
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:05,060
Gary blauman did it.

194
00:08:05,130 --> 00:08:08,260
Guy I used to work with, the guy's a legend now.

195
00:08:08,330 --> 00:08:10,000
We were at the morning meeting

196
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:13,060
and old blauman was getting reamed out but good.

197
00:08:13,130 --> 00:08:14,430
Pretty much routine

198
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:16,000
At the morning meeting, but then,

199
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:19,030
On this particular day, something amazing happened.

200
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:20,430
You made yourself look bad,

201
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,660
You made this company look bad, and quite frankly,

202
00:08:22,730 --> 00:08:26,260
You made our friends, the north koreans, look bad!

203
00:08:26,330 --> 00:08:27,760
And I'll tell you something else,

204
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:29,600
Blauman, if you think for one moment...

205
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:31,200
You know what, bilson?

206
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:32,960
You can kiss my ass.

207
00:08:33,030 --> 00:08:35,200
Oh, snap.

208
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:37,030
-What? -you heard me.

209
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:39,530
I don't need to take your crap anymore.

210
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:41,860
My cousin's website went public today,

211
00:08:41,930 --> 00:08:43,900
And I made a pile of money on the ipo,

212
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:47,000
so you know what I think Of this whole damn company?

213
00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:52,360
Oh, my god.

214
00:08:52,430 --> 00:08:54,200
He peed on the conference table?

215
00:08:56,230 --> 00:08:57,500
Come on, come on, come on,

216
00:08:57,560 --> 00:09:00,000
Come on, come on, come on, come on.

217
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:03,000
Uh, look, could you guys just look away for a second

218
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:04,200
Till I get started?

219
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:07,060
Come on.

220
00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:08,960
Come on.

221
00:09:09,030 --> 00:09:11,660
Does this help?

222
00:09:11,730 --> 00:09:13,960
W ur eventually, he just gave up and left.

223
00:09:14,030 --> 00:09:16,160
And then his cousin's website tanked.

224
00:09:16,230 --> 00:09:18,460
And then he became a janitor at an old folks' home

225
00:09:18,530 --> 00:09:22,060
And moved into a one-room apartment above a bowling alley.

226
00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:26,100
That's it? that's the end of the story?

227
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:28,800
No, no, of course not-- he died.

228
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:30,530
How does that help me?

229
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:32,460
How does any of this help me?

230
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:34,460
Can somebody, for god's sakes,

231
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:37,760
Please give me one piece of useful advice?

232
00:09:37,830 --> 00:09:39,730
Lily, control your woman.

233
00:09:41,130 --> 00:09:43,760
The lesson of blauman is that when your boss

234
00:09:43,830 --> 00:09:46,330
Screams at you, you never scream back.

235
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:48,400
That's why there's a little thing in corporate america

236
00:09:48,460 --> 00:09:51,560
I like to call the chain of screaming.

237
00:09:51,630 --> 00:09:53,300
-Chain of screaming? -yes.

238
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,830
The chain of screaming starts at the top.

239
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:59,200
Arthur's boss's boss screams at arthur's boss.

240
00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:01,830
Arthur's boss screams at arthur.

241
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:03,900
Arthur screams at you.

242
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:06,400
You go home and scream at lily.

243
00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:10,700
Lily screams at one of the kids in her kindergarten class.

244
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:13,730
Then that kid screams at her dad,

245
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:16,360
Arthur's boss's boss.

246
00:10:16,430 --> 00:10:19,230
And the whole thing starts all over again,

247
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:22,430
Thus completing the circle of screaming.

248
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:23,960
I thought it was a chain of screaming.

249
00:10:24,030 --> 00:10:26,500
It's a circle, ted, I called it a circle.

250
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:28,660
I don't scream at lily.

251
00:10:28,730 --> 00:10:30,630
And I don't scream at my kids,

252
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:33,360
None of whom have parents who work at marshall's firm.

253
00:10:33,430 --> 00:10:35,200
So it's not a circle.

254
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:37,360
Fine-- you want it to be a chain of screaming,

255
00:10:37,430 --> 00:10:38,900
It's a chain of screaming.

256
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:40,430
I came up with the circle idea halfway through,

257
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:42,360
Cause I thought it was a more elegant metaphor,

258
00:10:42,430 --> 00:10:43,900
But fine, ruin it!

259
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:46,030
You guys always undermine me

260
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:48,460
When I'm trying to make a point, and I'm sick of it!

261
00:10:48,530 --> 00:10:50,860
God, I'm surrounded by idiots!

262
00:10:50,930 --> 00:10:52,760
Idiots!

263
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,960
See, doesn't everyone feel better now?

264
00:10:58,030 --> 00:10:59,860
Lily, I need your take on this.

265
00:10:59,930 --> 00:11:01,530
What... what should I do?

266
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,800
Well, what I teach my kids in kindergarten...

267
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:05,460
Oh, god.

268
00:11:05,530 --> 00:11:09,200
Kt.is, when dealing with a bully, the most important thing

269
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:11,530
Is to be constructive and positive.

270
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,360
Hello, arthur.

271
00:11:13,430 --> 00:11:14,560
Hello, marshall.

272
00:11:14,630 --> 00:11:17,130
I have the ninja report right here.

273
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,700
But arthur,

274
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:21,860
In the future, if you want someone to do their best work,

275
00:11:21,930 --> 00:11:25,300
Try to motivate them, not with fear and intimidation,

276
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:29,300
But through encouragement, inspiration and respect.

277
00:11:30,630 --> 00:11:33,800
Well said, marshall-- I needed to hear that.

278
00:11:34,830 --> 00:11:36,100
By the way,

279
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:37,960
I saw your wife's picture in your office.

280
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:39,030
That is one tasty slice.

281
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:40,360
Oh, you're damn right.

282
00:11:40,430 --> 00:11:43,000
You know what I'm gonna do when I get home?

283
00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:44,700
Oh, yeah.

284
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:46,660
I'm gonna rip that girl's clothes off...

285
00:11:46,730 --> 00:11:48,060
That's it.

286
00:11:48,130 --> 00:11:49,400
...just throw her on the bed...

287
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:51,030
That's where she belongs.

288
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:53,560
...and drive her home like a pack of sled dogs!

289
00:11:58,260 --> 00:12:00,000
It's bad, guys.

290
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:01,660
Mama needs it bad.

291
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:05,860
You're right, baby, it's about respect.

292
00:12:05,930 --> 00:12:08,230
That is the first useful thing anyone's said to me tonight.

293
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:09,800
Can you give me that speech again?

294
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:11,960
I'm gonna drive her home like a pack of...

295
00:12:12,030 --> 00:12:13,300
No, the other part, please.

296
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:16,030
I have the ninja report right here, but...

297
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:18,030
And it seemed like that was the end of it,

298
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:19,700
But it wasn't, because the next night...

299
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:21,830
Which of these carpets would look better

300
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:23,360
In the new apartment?

301
00:12:23,430 --> 00:12:26,560
I like the color of this one, but this one's so soft.

302
00:12:26,630 --> 00:12:28,760
It would feel great on your bare feet...

303
00:12:28,830 --> 00:12:33,400
...or your bare back, a bead of eager sweat

304
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:35,060
Rolling down

305
00:12:35,130 --> 00:12:37,000
Your trembling bosom.

306
00:12:39,130 --> 00:12:41,900
Lily, didn't we just go through this with bathroom tiles?

307
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:47,000
Shh, don't say my name.

308
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:48,900
Lily can't know it's me.

309
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:50,160
Just pretend you're talking to stella.

310
00:12:50,230 --> 00:12:51,330
Be all lovey dovey.

311
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:53,000
Hey, stella.

312
00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:56,330
Sweetie, how's it going?

313
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:59,430
Not good, not good at all.

314
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:00,830
Where are you right now?

315
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:03,660
Right downstairs, come find me.

316
00:13:03,730 --> 00:13:05,360
Without lily.

317
00:13:05,430 --> 00:13:08,160
Okay, I'll see you soon.

318
00:13:08,230 --> 00:13:10,100
I love you.

319
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:11,930
I love you, too.

320
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:17,300
Wow, you two are already saying the "l" word, huh?

321
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:18,630
Apparently.

322
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:21,630
You hitting that?

323
00:13:30,230 --> 00:13:32,160
I'm in trouble, ted.

324
00:13:36,730 --> 00:13:38,460
Ted, I'm freakin' out, man.

325
00:13:38,530 --> 00:13:41,960
Um... it's a new car, so just be careful...

326
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:43,830
I did something stupid-- can we just drive somewhere?

327
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:45,460
I need to get away-- just drive, man.

328
00:13:45,530 --> 00:13:46,830
Please just drive.

329
00:13:48,330 --> 00:13:50,400
It's just, this is a really good parking spot.

330
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:51,900
Dude!

331
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:53,600
Look, just tell me what happened first.

332
00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:55,830
Remember how I said I was gonna give that big speech

333
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:57,900
That lily told me to give, be firm but respectful?

334
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:59,460
Well, it didn't totally go that way.

335
00:13:59,530 --> 00:14:00,930
There is a lot of ketchup on that burger.

336
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:04,260
Sorry-- what happened?

337
00:14:04,330 --> 00:14:05,860
After we all finished talking last night,

338
00:14:05,930 --> 00:14:08,330
I went to the diner to finish working on the ninja report.

339
00:14:09,730 --> 00:14:10,730
Hey, marshall.

340
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:14,660
How long have you been sitting there?

341
00:14:14,730 --> 00:14:17,460
If you go in there with lily's kindergarten nonsense,

342
00:14:17,530 --> 00:14:19,100
You're gonna get torn apart.

343
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:21,130
I'm here to save your life-- you hungry?

344
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:23,000
Yeah, I was just about to order.

345
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:24,330
What do you want?

346
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:25,600
A blt and gravy fries.

347
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:28,500
Okay, friends, what do you like?

348
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:30,430
A green tea with lemon for me,

349
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:32,630
And for my friend here, the meatloaf, please.

350
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:33,700
Very good.

351
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:36,130
No, I didn't want meatloaf.

352
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:39,360
Marshall, the chain of screaming is a real thing.

353
00:14:39,430 --> 00:14:42,960
Arthur screamed at you-- now you have to scream at someone else.

354
00:14:43,030 --> 00:14:44,400
No, I don't.

355
00:14:44,460 --> 00:14:47,400
Yes, you do, or else that anger is gonna eat you alive.

356
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:49,630
Who would I even scream at?

357
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:51,030
I don't know.

358
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:53,600
How about somebody who's disappointed you?

359
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:56,330
Someone who's let you down.

360
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:58,660
Someone who's gonna bring you meatloaf

361
00:14:58,730 --> 00:15:03,430
When you explicitly ordered a blt and gravy fries.

362
00:15:06,430 --> 00:15:08,200
No.

363
00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:09,860
Hey, I was just heading to the bar.

364
00:15:09,930 --> 00:15:11,260
What are you guys doing out here?

365
00:15:11,330 --> 00:15:12,400
Oh, I was just telling ted a story.

366
00:15:12,460 --> 00:15:14,530
Ooh, I like stories.

367
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:16,300
You want a lick?

368
00:15:17,630 --> 00:15:20,260
-What? -is that ice cream cone big enough?

369
00:15:20,330 --> 00:15:22,530
Uh, it's delicious enough.

370
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:24,430
Okay, so...

371
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:25,830
Then I say to barney...

372
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:28,660
I'm not gonna scream at the waiter, barney.

373
00:15:28,730 --> 00:15:29,930
Yes, you are.

374
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:34,460
That waiter is every boss and every bully

375
00:15:34,530 --> 00:15:36,660
Who ever embarrassed or belittled you.

376
00:15:37,660 --> 00:15:39,130
And how dare he deny you

377
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:40,530
The one thing that you want,

378
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:42,630
That would make you happy at this moment.

379
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:45,130
A blt and gravy fries.

380
00:15:46,430 --> 00:15:49,560
One green tea with lemon, one meatloaf.

381
00:15:49,630 --> 00:15:52,400
Enjoy, my friends.

382
00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:53,430
Marshall.

383
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:54,830
Excuse me?

384
00:15:56,630 --> 00:15:58,060
Yes?

385
00:15:58,130 --> 00:15:59,930
This is not what I ordered.

386
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,030
Yes, it is.

387
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:06,900
I beg your pardon, sir,

388
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:10,200
But I ordered a blt and gravy fries,

389
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:12,730
And as the customer, I'm always right, so...

390
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:16,360
No, no, I am not going to stand here and take this!

391
00:16:16,460 --> 00:16:20,060
I am at the end of a triple shift-- that's 18 hours!--

392
00:16:20,130 --> 00:16:21,260
And then I have

393
00:16:21,330 --> 00:16:23,300
To take two trains and a bus to astoria

394
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:26,660
To have my wife scream at me because I'm never home.

395
00:16:26,730 --> 00:16:29,860
No, no, you eat your damn meatloaf!

396
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:34,430
Hey, what are you guys doing out here?

397
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:36,260
Oh sweet, can I get a toot?

398
00:16:36,330 --> 00:16:37,900
Uh-uh-- against car rules, it's against car rules!

399
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:39,860
Oh, ted, relax, it's cuban.

400
00:16:39,930 --> 00:16:41,760
People pay to have their car smell like this.

401
00:16:41,830 --> 00:16:44,430
Well, that's just not true.

402
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:45,830
Oh, marshall, switch seats with me.

403
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:47,130
I called shotgun for all eternity.

404
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:48,360
You can't call shotgun for eternity.

405
00:16:48,430 --> 00:16:49,860
Well, that's funny, cause I did!

406
00:16:49,930 --> 00:16:51,200
It's case by case.

407
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:53,960
Guys, I'm telling a life-altering story here!

408
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:57,360
A 20% tip, really, for that waiter?

409
00:16:57,430 --> 00:17:00,160
I don't know, barney, he worked a triple, it just...

410
00:17:00,230 --> 00:17:02,160
If you're not gonna yell at the waiter,

411
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:03,460
Yell at me.

412
00:17:03,530 --> 00:17:05,130
-What? -yell at me.

413
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:07,000
I'm not gonna yell at you, barney.

414
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:08,900
What, you think you're gonna upset me?

415
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:10,960
Please, give me your best shot.

416
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:12,800
Okay, fine-- what, you want me to yell at you?

417
00:17:12,860 --> 00:17:14,560
Yeah.

418
00:17:14,630 --> 00:17:17,800
This is me yelling at you, barney.

419
00:17:17,860 --> 00:17:20,900
I'm sorry, I couldn't hear you over the sound of a butterfly

420
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:23,400
Landing on a leaf about three blocks away.

421
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:26,500
This is me yelling at you, barney!

422
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:29,330
Okay, you got some volume, now give me some content.

423
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:30,860
Make it hurt.

424
00:17:30,930 --> 00:17:34,060
You don't look as good in suits as you think you do!

425
00:17:34,130 --> 00:17:35,730
No, something that's true-- come on.

426
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:37,160
The man made you cry.

427
00:17:37,230 --> 00:17:38,760
Make me cry.

428
00:17:38,830 --> 00:17:39,930
Your mom's a slut!

429
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,560
Yes.

430
00:17:41,630 --> 00:17:44,360
Your mom's a slut, and I'm sorry, barney,

431
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:46,760
But you and your brother clearly have different fathers,

432
00:17:46,830 --> 00:17:48,260
And you know why?

433
00:17:48,330 --> 00:17:50,300
It's probably because your mom is a slutty slut!

434
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:51,430
Keep going.

435
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:53,100
I don't care what you say.

436
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:54,600
Bob barker is not your father!

437
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:57,060
Okay, now, well, that's just not cool.

438
00:17:57,130 --> 00:17:58,400
Oh my god, barney, I'm so sorry...

439
00:17:58,460 --> 00:17:59,900
No, I'm kidding-- keep going.

440
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:01,500
Bob barker's not your father!

441
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:04,930
You've concocted this delusional idea that a game show host

442
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,760
Is your real father, and he's not!

443
00:18:06,830 --> 00:18:09,000
You were abandoned, barney!

444
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:10,960
You were abandoned, and you never dealt with it,

445
00:18:11,030 --> 00:18:12,430
And so now you never allow yourself

446
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:14,300
To feel anything, and that's how you survive

447
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:16,260
In this corporate world, and if I keep heading

448
00:18:16,330 --> 00:18:18,500
Down this path, I'm gonna turn into you!

449
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:20,500
And I don't want that!

450
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:22,530
I don't want any of this!

451
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:24,800
This is not why I became a lawyer.

452
00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:27,260
This is not the person that I wanted to be.

453
00:18:27,330 --> 00:18:29,960
I quit, arthur!

454
00:18:30,030 --> 00:18:32,260
I quit!

455
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:38,760
Well, thank you, eriksen, I needed to hear that.

456
00:18:38,830 --> 00:18:40,930
Really, 'cause I didn't mean to attack you personally,

457
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,330
It's just that i...

458
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:44,360
No, no, no, the part where you said, "i quit."

459
00:18:44,430 --> 00:18:46,460
Now we don't have to pay you a severance package.

460
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:51,360
Uh, security's gonna rough you up a bit on the way out.

461
00:18:57,900 --> 00:19:00,260
Robin, you dropped a little ice cream...

462
00:19:00,330 --> 00:19:01,260
-Dude! -dude! -dude!

463
00:19:01,330 --> 00:19:02,500
I'm sorry.

464
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:04,230
Don't blame this on me, marshall.

465
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:06,230
I told you to yell at someone beneath you.

466
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:08,130
The circle of screaming is...

467
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:10,300
The chain of scr...

468
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:12,700
Pyramid-- the pyramid of screaming!

469
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:14,560
The pyramid of screaming.

470
00:19:14,630 --> 00:19:16,830
How am I supposed to tell lily?

471
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:18,700
She supported me through three years of law school,

472
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:21,060
And now is the time when I'm supposed to pay her back.

473
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:23,660
Now we're gonna lose the apartment.

474
00:19:23,730 --> 00:19:26,060
The place where we were gonna raise our children.

475
00:19:26,130 --> 00:19:28,530
How am I supposed to tell the person who I love

476
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:30,200
More than anything in this world

477
00:19:30,260 --> 00:19:31,900
That I've just thrown away our future?

478
00:19:37,330 --> 00:19:39,100
Everybody out, everybody out of the new car!

479
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:40,330
Out of the new car!

480
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:42,330
Ted, screaming never solves anything.

481
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:46,860
And so marshall finally had to tell lily what happened.

482
00:19:46,930 --> 00:19:48,800
I'm so sorry.

483
00:19:48,860 --> 00:19:51,260
I just lost it.

484
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:53,200
But I can fix it.

485
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:55,460
First thing tomorrow, I'm gonna go in there

486
00:19:55,530 --> 00:20:00,600
On my hands and knees and beg for my job back.

487
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:02,500
No, you're not.

488
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:04,660
What?

489
00:20:04,730 --> 00:20:08,860
Marshall, our future isn't money or an apartment.

490
00:20:08,930 --> 00:20:11,460
And it's definitely not you being miserable

491
00:20:11,530 --> 00:20:12,930
At that horrible job.

492
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:17,700
I'm just happy to have my husband back.

493
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:20,430
We'll figure the rest out.

494
00:20:21,430 --> 00:20:23,700
I love you.

495
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:25,300
I love you, too.

496
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:29,760
Ultimately, they were able to make ends meet

497
00:20:29,830 --> 00:20:32,930
Without going bust on the apartment.

498
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:35,800
You sure about this?

499
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:39,200
Yeah, who needs a car in new york city, right?

500
00:20:40,730 --> 00:20:43,030
Ted, I don't think I can accept...

501
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:45,000
Marshall, don't make me scream at you.

502
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Thanks a lot, buddy.

503
00:20:52,230 --> 00:20:53,830
You guys did it in the car, didn't...

504
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:55,260
Oh, yeah!
