00:00:01,972 --> 00:00:06,203
<i>Kids, sometimes in life you see someone
and you just instantly know</i>

2
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:08,928
<i>this is the person for you.</i>

3
00:00:09,028 --> 00:00:10,277
<i>It can happen anywhere.</i>

4
00:00:10,459 --> 00:00:13,345
<i>Even the waiting room
of a tattoo removal clinic.</i>

5
00:00:13,797 --> 00:00:15,694
<i>And that's what happened
when I met...</i>

6
00:00:16,344 --> 00:00:17,446
<i>...Stella.</i>

7
00:00:22,251 --> 00:00:24,422
Ah, the butterfly tramp stamp.

8
00:00:24,522 --> 00:00:25,662
My bread and butter.

9
00:00:26,329 --> 00:00:29,244
So I'm guessing that the real story
involves a bad breakup and some booze.

10
00:00:29,477 --> 00:00:31,021
Unless it's a gang tattoo,
in which case,

11
00:00:31,063 --> 00:00:33,044
I think it's time to find a new gang.

12
00:00:33,721 --> 00:00:35,936
No, I just thought it would be cool
to get a caterpillar tattoo,

13
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:38,077
and then a few weeks went by,
and all of a sudden...

14
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:41,881
Well, I can get rid
of it in ten one-hour sessions,

15
00:00:41,986 --> 00:00:44,303
but, I should warn you,
laser surgery's very painful.

16
00:00:44,739 --> 00:00:47,534
Well, I think you'll find I have
a very high tolerance for pain.

17
00:00:47,636 --> 00:00:49,974
Just last night, I sat through
the worst movie ever made.

18
00:00:50,179 --> 00:00:53,704
- Oh, Plan 9 From Outer Space?
- No, the worst movie...

19
00:00:53,806 --> 00:00:55,561
Manos: Hands of Fate.

20
00:00:55,768 --> 00:00:58,553
Uh, I'm a doctor, went to
medical school. It's Plan 9.

21
00:00:58,656 --> 00:01:00,603
If you don't believe me, it's playing
down at the Pamela Theater.

22
00:01:00,708 --> 00:01:02,362
I don't believe you, Doctor.

23
00:01:03,307 --> 00:01:04,902
Well, what are you doing tonight?

24
00:01:08,988 --> 00:01:09,692
Hello.

25
00:01:09,896 --> 00:01:11,383
- Hey, Ted.
- Hey.

26
00:01:11,486 --> 00:01:13,251
Hey, put that away.
Tonight's on me.

27
00:01:13,499 --> 00:01:15,711
- Oh, no, no, don't...
- Come on, I insist.

28
00:01:15,918 --> 00:01:17,422
That's so nice. Thank you.

29
00:01:17,738 --> 00:01:20,092
Hey, guys, this is my friend Ted.
He wants to pay.

30
00:01:21,558 --> 00:01:23,934
- Thank you.
- One, two, three, four.

31
00:01:28,769 --> 00:01:29,954
Is something wrong?

32
00:01:30,388 --> 00:01:31,933
No, it's just, um...

33
00:01:32,658 --> 00:01:35,941
I'm just a little embarrassed.
I thought this was a date.

34
00:01:36,306 --> 00:01:38,874
But it's no big deal.
Don't worry about it.

35
00:01:40,289 --> 00:01:41,004
What's wrong?

36
00:01:41,457 --> 00:01:44,324
Ted's embarrassed,
he thought this was a date.

37
00:01:44,967 --> 00:01:46,381
Ted thought this was a date.

38
00:01:46,489 --> 00:01:49,091
Stella, did you know
Ted thought this was a date?

39
00:01:49,196 --> 00:01:52,093
What? I'm not allowed to date
a patient. It's an AMA rule.

40
00:01:52,199 --> 00:01:54,593
She's not allowed to date patients.
It's an AMA rule.

41
00:01:54,698 --> 00:01:57,261
She's not allowed to date patients.
It's an AMA rule.

42
00:01:57,368 --> 00:01:59,394
- She's not allowed to date...
- Yeah, I got it.

43
00:01:59,577 --> 00:02:01,574
We all got it.
Ted's a schmuck.

<i>How I Met Your Mother
3x13 - Ten Sessions</i>

47
00:02:14,816 --> 00:02:17,333
<i>for the "Have You Met Team"
for www.forom.com</i>

48
00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:20,703
And you bought all the tickets.

49
00:02:20,807 --> 00:02:23,874
Yeah, yeah.
Hey, you were right.

50
00:02:24,087 --> 00:02:26,832
Worst movie-going experience ever.

51
00:02:26,938 --> 00:02:29,094
Of course, it had nothing to do
with the movie.

52
00:02:29,199 --> 00:02:31,245
I am so sorry that
you thought that was a date.

53
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:34,495
No, it's fine. I got to hang out
with you on girls' night out.

54
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:37,692
All right, so if you're not allowed
to date a patient, I'll just...

55
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:41,043
I'll wait until these ten session are up
and then I'll ask you out then.

56
00:02:41,329 --> 00:02:43,083
Well, then, fair warning:

57
00:02:43,849 --> 00:02:44,754
I'm going to say no.

58
00:02:45,417 --> 00:02:47,784
Really? I'm getting
mixed signals from you.

59
00:02:47,888 --> 00:02:50,014
I feel like you've been staring
at my ass for quite some time.

60
00:02:51,379 --> 00:02:52,323
What, you're married?

61
00:02:53,137 --> 00:02:53,965
Boyfriend?

62
00:02:54,068 --> 00:02:55,095
Lesbian?

63
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:56,814
Only date black guys?

64
00:02:57,628 --> 00:03:00,484
And yet you can say
with absolute confidence

65
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:04,234
that ten weeks from now, if I ask you
out on a date, your answer will be...

66
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:05,312
No.

67
00:03:06,358 --> 00:03:07,905
No... Hmm.

68
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:12,282
What could she mean
when she says no?

69
00:03:13,057 --> 00:03:15,364
I don't know, it is totally cryptic.

70
00:03:15,628 --> 00:03:17,235
This is far from over.

71
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:18,914
We're talking ten weeks from now.

72
00:03:19,019 --> 00:03:20,334
Who knows what she'll want then?

73
00:03:20,438 --> 00:03:22,584
Do you know what you're going to
want for lunch ten weeks from now?

74
00:03:22,789 --> 00:03:24,964
Sloppy Joe, shrimp cocktail
and a milk shake.

75
00:03:26,158 --> 00:03:27,703
Ted, do you know how long
it takes a woman

76
00:03:27,808 --> 00:03:29,585
to decide whether or not
she's going to sleep with a guy?

77
00:03:29,688 --> 00:03:31,132
8.3 seconds.

78
00:03:31,708 --> 00:03:34,384
After that, her decision is made.
She will not change her mind.

79
00:03:34,488 --> 00:03:36,395
- That's ridiculous.
- Is it?

80
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:38,932
Describe your first 8.3 seconds
with Stella.

81
00:03:39,898 --> 00:03:42,824
Lower back butterfly tattoo,
you're up.

82
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:49,404
So we got off to a rocky start.

83
00:03:49,517 --> 00:03:51,284
That may be a problem
for some guys,

84
00:03:51,387 --> 00:03:53,223
but I get better over time.

85
00:03:53,327 --> 00:03:55,113
I'm not some Top 40 song...

86
00:03:55,410 --> 00:03:56,742
easily digestible.

87
00:03:56,850 --> 00:03:58,702
I'm complex.
I require...

88
00:03:58,807 --> 00:04:00,703
time and multiple listens.

89
00:04:01,138 --> 00:04:02,755
I'm "Stairway to Heaven."

90
00:04:02,957 --> 00:04:06,753
Wow, Roger Daltrey just
rolled over in his grave.

91
00:04:09,679 --> 00:04:10,883
That's not the right guy, is it?

92
00:04:12,167 --> 00:04:13,972
He's not even dead, is he?

93
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:16,225
I think that's great, Ted.

94
00:04:16,327 --> 00:04:18,174
You can do whatever
you set your mind to.

95
00:04:18,279 --> 00:04:20,534
In fact, you've inspired me.

96
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:22,683
I'm going to stop biting my nails.

97
00:04:22,789 --> 00:04:26,312
- But, baby, you love biting your nails.
- I know, but I'm doing this for Ted.

98
00:04:29,170 --> 00:04:30,893
God, this is really hard.

99
00:04:31,918 --> 00:04:33,354
Give me ten sessions,

100
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:34,984
I'm going to turn that "no"
into a "yes."

101
00:04:35,089 --> 00:04:37,074
Really, Ted?
You think so?

102
00:04:37,388 --> 00:04:39,782
Well, tell me, how did the rest
of that session go?

103
00:04:40,418 --> 00:04:42,005
This is going to hurt a little.

104
00:04:42,219 --> 00:04:44,102
Yeah, well, I can handle pain.

105
00:04:44,318 --> 00:04:46,733
This one time
I was playing tennis, and...

106
00:04:51,277 --> 00:04:54,605
Yeah, but tattoo removal really hurts.

107
00:04:54,707 --> 00:04:56,385
Everyone probably sounds like that.

108
00:04:56,879 --> 00:04:59,385
Doctor, are you all right?
I heard a woman screaming in here.

109
00:05:08,598 --> 00:05:10,813
Here's to nine more great sessions.

110
00:05:15,947 --> 00:05:17,395
<i>And so the weeks went by.</i>

111
00:05:17,927 --> 00:05:19,395
<i>The second session
I told her about</i>

112
00:05:19,497 --> 00:05:22,083
<i>how I spent a summer working
with inner-city kids.</i>

113
00:05:22,579 --> 00:05:25,332
<i>The third session we both spoke
nothing but French.</i>

114
00:05:26,489 --> 00:05:29,912
<i>The fourth session I made her laugh
so hard she fell out of her chair.</i>

115
00:05:32,439 --> 00:05:34,455
<i>So by the time the fifth session
came around...</i>

116
00:05:34,777 --> 00:05:35,495
Still no.

117
00:05:37,579 --> 00:05:38,373
Still no.

118
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:40,964
What's up with that?
I mean, I juggled.

119
00:05:41,377 --> 00:05:42,673
You juggled?

120
00:05:42,867 --> 00:05:44,805
I thought you were trying
to impress her.

121
00:05:45,069 --> 00:05:46,075
You do magic.

122
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:47,883
How is juggling any lamer than magic?

123
00:05:48,090 --> 00:05:49,394
Magic's not lame.

124
00:05:49,659 --> 00:05:51,735
- I don't get it. I mean...
- Is this lame?

125
00:05:54,927 --> 00:05:57,145
We said no fireballs at the table.

126
00:05:57,408 --> 00:05:58,733
What the hell is wrong with you?

127
00:05:58,938 --> 00:06:00,104
There's alcohol in here.

128
00:06:00,308 --> 00:06:01,064
- Barney...
- I...

129
00:06:01,267 --> 00:06:02,423
We've talked about this.

130
00:06:02,530 --> 00:06:05,614
- It's a fire code violation.
- Yeah, but Ted provoked me.

131
00:06:05,819 --> 00:06:07,902
No, you are on a time-out.
Go sit over there.

132
00:06:08,108 --> 00:06:10,024
- But...
- Go!

133
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:14,395
Anyway... I don't get it.

134
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:15,704
She should be into me by now.

135
00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:17,333
You know, you can do this, Ted.

136
00:06:17,537 --> 00:06:20,995
I said that I would stop biting
my nails, and kablam-ey.

137
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:22,883
It's just a challenge.

138
00:06:22,989 --> 00:06:24,543
It can't be easy
to woo someone while

139
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:26,762
you're sticking
your naked butt in their face.

140
00:06:27,119 --> 00:06:28,472
Works for baboons.

141
00:06:30,877 --> 00:06:32,392
It's called "presenting."

142
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:34,693
I got four sessions left.

143
00:06:34,799 --> 00:06:36,772
There's got to be an angle
I'm not seeing.

144
00:06:37,074 --> 00:06:40,185
You can't turn a "no" into a "yes," Ted.
Can't be done.

145
00:06:40,282 --> 00:06:43,407
I don't know, Barney.
I mean, sometimes persistence pays off.

146
00:06:43,511 --> 00:06:45,528
- I said "yes" eventually.
- No, you didn't.

147
00:06:45,631 --> 00:06:47,484
You were like, "No, we can't,

148
00:06:47,588 --> 00:06:49,323
we're friends.
It would mess up the dynamic

149
00:06:49,430 --> 00:06:50,594
- of the group."
- To Ted.

150
00:06:50,699 --> 00:06:51,662
Oh, right.

151
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:54,242
Wait a second.
Wait a second, I got the angle.

152
00:06:54,869 --> 00:06:56,253
Sir, please don't yell at me,

153
00:06:56,459 --> 00:06:59,544
because when people yell at me,
I have a tendency to start crying.

154
00:07:00,158 --> 00:07:01,625
Please don't do it.

155
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:03,593
Abby, I've told you before.

156
00:07:03,697 --> 00:07:05,584
When they're rude to you,
hang up the phone.

157
00:07:06,570 --> 00:07:09,093
Go on, you can do this, hang up.

158
00:07:09,758 --> 00:07:10,594
Hang it up.

159
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:13,725
<i>I am too busy to waste my time...</i>

160
00:07:15,408 --> 00:07:19,485
I'm sorry, I just wish that some of
the patients would be nicer to you.

161
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:22,063
The receptionist.
That's my way in.

162
00:07:22,268 --> 00:07:23,153
I like this.

163
00:07:23,357 --> 00:07:26,234
Seduce the receptionist.
That's a great plan.

164
00:07:26,488 --> 00:07:27,764
That's not the plan.

165
00:07:27,869 --> 00:07:30,032
And how would that
help me with Stella?

166
00:07:30,137 --> 00:07:30,842
Who?

167
00:07:32,019 --> 00:07:32,745
Here's the plan.

168
00:07:35,487 --> 00:07:37,163
Hi. Here.

169
00:07:37,419 --> 00:07:38,242
I stopped...

170
00:07:42,728 --> 00:07:44,625
Hi, I stopped for coffee and I...

171
00:07:44,668 --> 00:07:45,853
and I thought I'd grab you something.

172
00:07:45,959 --> 00:07:48,114
Oh, wow, thank you, that's so nice.

173
00:07:48,218 --> 00:07:49,112
You're like a knight.

174
00:07:49,218 --> 00:07:51,015
I should call you Sir Ted.

175
00:07:51,987 --> 00:07:52,683
What?

176
00:07:53,437 --> 00:07:55,732
Nothing. Nothing.
It's really stupid.

177
00:07:56,538 --> 00:07:58,184
Um, Dr. Zinman,
Ted's here.

178
00:07:59,128 --> 00:08:00,184
Thanks. Thanks, Abby.

179
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:05,233
And now we wait.

180
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:07,602
<i>And sure enough, by session seven,</i>

181
00:08:07,710 --> 00:08:09,452
<i>she saw me in a whole new light.</i>

182
00:08:09,559 --> 00:08:12,112
Okay, I'm about to break
my big rule here.

183
00:08:12,677 --> 00:08:13,372
Break it.

184
00:08:16,270 --> 00:08:17,803
Abby goes bowling
with her church group

185
00:08:17,907 --> 00:08:19,262
every Wednesday night...

186
00:08:19,370 --> 00:08:21,665
and she really wanted to invite you,
but she's too shy.

187
00:08:24,088 --> 00:08:25,042
Abby is...?

188
00:08:26,949 --> 00:08:28,232
My receptionist.

189
00:08:28,669 --> 00:08:31,522
You really made quite an impression
on her with the coffee the other day.

190
00:08:31,629 --> 00:08:33,135
I mean, she has really not stopped
talking about you.

191
00:08:33,937 --> 00:08:35,062
Oh, Abby.

192
00:08:35,777 --> 00:08:37,454
I thought you said "Alan."

193
00:08:38,060 --> 00:08:40,645
But you just said, "Abby is...?"

194
00:08:40,937 --> 00:08:41,805
Right.

195
00:08:42,508 --> 00:08:44,524
Right, I thought I said "Alan."

196
00:08:44,917 --> 00:08:45,985
Who's Alan?

197
00:08:46,827 --> 00:08:47,934
Who's Abby?

198
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:50,723
My receptionist.

199
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:52,682
Exactly.

200
00:08:56,408 --> 00:08:57,702
What is happening?

201
00:08:59,369 --> 00:09:01,453
You just got to be yourself,
no more gimmicks.

202
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:03,895
You're right,
no more gimmicks.

203
00:09:04,049 --> 00:09:04,755
One more gimmick.

204
00:09:05,327 --> 00:09:06,425
<i>You know what's on her shelf?</i>

205
00:09:06,628 --> 00:09:08,884
<i>That self-help book The Power of Me.</i>

206
00:09:09,978 --> 00:09:12,105
I know, I know,
but I thought if I read it,

207
00:09:12,208 --> 00:09:13,762
maybe we'd have something new
to talk about.

208
00:09:15,718 --> 00:09:19,145
It's actually a great book. It taught me
the power of complete memory.

209
00:09:19,577 --> 00:09:20,395
Can I borrow your copy?

210
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:23,933
I left it somewhere.
I forget.

211
00:09:27,518 --> 00:09:29,485
Hi.
Ted Mosby for Dr. Zinman.

212
00:09:29,870 --> 00:09:30,692
Hi, Ted.

213
00:09:31,819 --> 00:09:33,095
I'll let her know.

214
00:09:36,118 --> 00:09:37,453
Telepathically?

215
00:09:37,829 --> 00:09:40,702
That's funny.
That's funny, smart, and great.

216
00:09:43,827 --> 00:09:45,125
I am so sorry that I am late.

217
00:09:45,227 --> 00:09:46,853
I have, like, two minutes for lunch
everyday. It's crazy.

218
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:50,544
Yeah, I understand. I was just, uh,
checking out the old bookshelf here.

219
00:09:50,848 --> 00:09:53,683
I see you've read The Power of Me.
It's funny...

220
00:09:53,788 --> 00:09:55,954
What? Oh, no.
No, no, no, no, no,

221
00:09:56,059 --> 00:09:58,285
I would never read that piece of crap.

222
00:09:58,387 --> 00:09:59,832
Some patient left it here.

223
00:09:59,939 --> 00:10:02,793
Oh, thank God.
I couldn't agree more.

224
00:10:02,899 --> 00:10:04,215
That's total crap.

225
00:10:04,317 --> 00:10:06,184
I see people reading that on the subway
and I just want to shout,

226
00:10:06,288 --> 00:10:07,434
"Get a life, people!"

227
00:10:07,689 --> 00:10:10,274
- Ted, I found your book.
- What?

228
00:10:10,488 --> 00:10:13,023
Your book The Power of Me. I think you
accidentally dropped it in the garbage.

229
00:10:13,228 --> 00:10:14,815
What? No, that's...
that's not mine.

230
00:10:14,918 --> 00:10:16,403
I've never seen that before in my life.

231
00:10:16,608 --> 00:10:17,942
No, you were reading it in the lobby.

232
00:10:18,049 --> 00:10:20,204
What, no, you have me confused
with someone else.

233
00:10:20,407 --> 00:10:22,783
No, no, look right here.
"From the personal library of Ted Mosby"

234
00:10:22,889 --> 00:10:24,333
That's you.

235
00:10:27,018 --> 00:10:27,835
Ted,

236
00:10:28,098 --> 00:10:29,452
I hate to say this,

237
00:10:29,558 --> 00:10:32,045
but I think it's
"nail the receptionist" time.

238
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:33,595
I'm not gonna nail the receptionist.

239
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:37,365
Ted, every little boy wants to grow up
to nail the doctor or the lawyer.

240
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:39,932
Somebody's gotta nail the receptionist.

241
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:41,762
No. I like Stella.

242
00:10:41,969 --> 00:10:43,702
Okay, I'm gonna stop you
right there, Ted.

243
00:10:43,808 --> 00:10:46,315
Your little Stella is not so perfect.

244
00:10:46,638 --> 00:10:47,834
What do you mean?

245
00:10:47,938 --> 00:10:51,215
I went down there
and checked her out for myself.

246
00:10:53,230 --> 00:10:54,802
And while I was down there,

247
00:10:54,909 --> 00:10:57,072
I discovered that she had a secret,

248
00:10:57,890 --> 00:11:01,035
a terrible...
terrible secret.

249
00:11:02,187 --> 00:11:03,374
What?
What is it?

250
00:11:06,567 --> 00:11:08,022
Hold on, I gotta pee.

251
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:14,157
Okay, I'm back.

252
00:11:16,163 --> 00:11:16,948
What's going on at work?

253
00:11:17,150 --> 00:11:18,366
What's the big secret?!

254
00:11:18,570 --> 00:11:19,656
Oh. Oh, right.

255
00:11:20,241 --> 00:11:21,615
Hi, I'd like to see Dr. Zinman, please.

256
00:11:21,821 --> 00:11:22,746
Sure, what's it regarding?

257
00:11:23,103 --> 00:11:26,168
Oh, I just want to see her. Want to
look at her, see what she looks like.

258
00:11:26,793 --> 00:11:28,165
I-I don't understand.

259
00:11:28,372 --> 00:11:31,626
I'm sorry, did I accidentally oprima
numero dos when I called?

260
00:11:32,050 --> 00:11:33,546
<i>Do you speak English?</i>

261
00:11:33,881 --> 00:11:35,677
I want to see her!

262
00:11:36,013 --> 00:11:37,426
Sir, please don't yell at me

263
00:11:37,633 --> 00:11:40,516
because when people yell at me,
I have a tendency to start crying.

264
00:11:41,681 --> 00:11:43,555
Please don't do that. Please.

265
00:11:44,453 --> 00:11:48,588
<i>At first she seemed great, beautiful,
smart, way out of your league.</i>

266
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:51,007
<i>But then, I overheard this conversation.</i>

267
00:11:52,603 --> 00:11:56,277
Oh, Abby, did my hypnotherapist
call yet?

268
00:11:56,723 --> 00:11:59,575
When am I going to kick
this folliculaphilia?

269
00:12:06,091 --> 00:12:07,206
Folliculaphilia?

270
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:09,458
Folliculaphilia.

271
00:12:10,163 --> 00:12:10,875
What is that?

272
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:13,716
Ted, your perfect woman...

273
00:12:13,730 --> 00:12:15,237
can only be attracted...

274
00:12:15,241 --> 00:12:16,905
to men with moustaches.

275
00:12:19,210 --> 00:12:23,638
That is the stupidest thing
I've ever heard. That's not real.

276
00:12:24,142 --> 00:12:26,395
You're right, Ted.
I'm just making that up.

277
00:12:26,601 --> 00:12:28,726
I know that you are
because there's no such thing.

278
00:12:30,703 --> 00:12:32,316
I got it a little bit.

279
00:12:38,573 --> 00:12:40,445
Hi. Uh, Ted Mosby for Dr. Zinman.

280
00:12:40,651 --> 00:12:42,976
Oh, hi, Ted.
Love the 'stache.

281
00:12:43,492 --> 00:12:46,076
You look like a youngTom Selleck,
only a million times handsomer.

282
00:12:49,050 --> 00:12:51,488
Dr. Zinman,
Magnum's here to see you.

283
00:12:51,721 --> 00:12:53,866
Just kidding.
Stupid.

284
00:12:56,030 --> 00:12:58,068
Sorry I'm late.
Typical two-minute lunch.

285
00:12:58,241 --> 00:13:01,176
So we are very close to getting...

286
00:13:07,010 --> 00:13:08,975
Why? Just why?

287
00:13:09,583 --> 00:13:11,435
Y-you don't remember?

288
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:16,356
I'll bet anyone ten bucks
I can get Ted to grow a moustache.

289
00:13:16,751 --> 00:13:18,445
Uh... okay.

290
00:13:20,322 --> 00:13:23,867
You sabotaged my next to last chance
with Stella for ten dollars?

291
00:13:24,072 --> 00:13:26,697
I know.
I would've done it for free.

292
00:13:27,511 --> 00:13:29,417
But, no. You owe me ten bucks.

293
00:13:30,432 --> 00:13:33,766
This is awful. My-my tenth session
is next week.

294
00:13:33,942 --> 00:13:35,537
I'm gonna ask her out and,

295
00:13:35,642 --> 00:13:39,217
she's gonna say the most demoralizing
syllable in the English language, no.

296
00:13:40,383 --> 00:13:42,307
You know what? Just forget it.
I'm not even gonna ask her.

297
00:13:42,510 --> 00:13:45,455
No, you have to. She likes you.
She said so herself.

298
00:13:45,792 --> 00:13:47,088
I mean...

299
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:49,267
Oh, my God,
you went and saw her, too.

300
00:13:49,473 --> 00:13:51,396
I swear to you, I did not.

301
00:13:57,220 --> 00:13:59,605
My wife's always getting on me
about my dry elbows.

302
00:13:59,812 --> 00:14:01,427
So good to be in a relationship.

303
00:14:01,592 --> 00:14:02,786
Anyone special in your life?

304
00:14:02,821 --> 00:14:04,847
Or maybe just someone
you're interested in?

305
00:14:04,950 --> 00:14:07,405
Interes-ted in?

306
00:14:10,053 --> 00:14:12,005
You know, we should really
get this mole checked out.

307
00:14:12,111 --> 00:14:13,635
It's just a little irregular.

308
00:14:13,741 --> 00:14:15,116
<i>Irregular?</i>

309
00:14:15,302 --> 00:14:16,786
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

310
00:14:16,893 --> 00:14:19,466
<i>This is it. It's all over.</i>

311
00:14:19,671 --> 00:14:21,705
One patients has this little butterfly
tattoo at the bottom of his back.

312
00:14:21,810 --> 00:14:24,135
Can you stop talking
about your other patients?!

313
00:14:24,243 --> 00:14:26,085
I'm dying here, woman!

314
00:14:27,762 --> 00:14:31,216
Look, even if it is something,
it's easily treatable, so try to relax.

315
00:14:31,321 --> 00:14:32,358
Okay.

316
00:14:32,563 --> 00:14:35,567
Hey, what was it you were saying before
about the guy with the butterfly tattoo?

317
00:14:36,753 --> 00:14:39,525
Oh, that... that's nothing.
It's just a little crush.

318
00:14:40,331 --> 00:14:42,705
So I will be calling you
with your results.

319
00:14:42,811 --> 00:14:44,466
Oh. Okay. Thank you.

320
00:14:46,472 --> 00:14:47,937
Oh, sir, your book!

321
00:14:49,862 --> 00:14:51,537
- No.
- Yes.

322
00:14:52,263 --> 00:14:53,556
She said "crush"?

323
00:14:54,603 --> 00:14:56,405
And she was talking about me?

324
00:14:57,433 --> 00:14:59,997
<i>That last session was
the least painful of all.</i>

325
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:02,918
<i>I savored every searing blast
of that laser.</i>

326
00:15:03,022 --> 00:15:04,196
All done.

327
00:15:04,791 --> 00:15:07,637
<i>The moment I'd waited
ten weeks for had arrived.</i>

328
00:15:08,421 --> 00:15:09,387
Stella...

329
00:15:10,521 --> 00:15:13,448
...now that I'm no longer your patient,

330
00:15:14,402 --> 00:15:16,915
would you like to have dinner with me?

331
00:15:20,050 --> 00:15:23,566
- Ted, you're a really nice guy...
- Oh, no.

332
00:15:23,772 --> 00:15:26,158
It has been so great
getting to know you.

333
00:15:26,363 --> 00:15:27,737
I am gonna kill Marshall.

334
00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:29,407
I've had so much fun
these last ten weeks.

335
00:15:29,610 --> 00:15:32,207
Oh, my God, this is worse
than the laser.

336
00:15:32,703 --> 00:15:34,076
I have a daughter.

337
00:15:35,263 --> 00:15:36,405
What?

338
00:15:36,861 --> 00:15:38,795
Her name's Lucy.
She's eight.

339
00:15:38,902 --> 00:15:42,258
Work and being with her,
that's pretty much my life.

340
00:15:42,701 --> 00:15:43,888
My social calendar

341
00:15:44,090 --> 00:15:46,605
is movie night with the girls
once a month when I can get a sitter.

342
00:15:46,712 --> 00:15:49,285
I mean, I've been to one
party in the past year...

343
00:15:49,391 --> 00:15:51,798
St. Paddy's Day...
it was awful, I left early.

344
00:15:51,901 --> 00:15:55,405
But, really, my only free time is
the two minutes I get for lunch, so...

345
00:15:55,510 --> 00:15:57,018
this is why I don't date.

346
00:15:59,461 --> 00:16:03,947
I only have time for one most important
person in my life, and that's Lucy.

347
00:16:04,463 --> 00:16:06,247
Anyway, it's been fun.

348
00:16:06,350 --> 00:16:08,597
Next time, think before you ink.

349
00:16:08,703 --> 00:16:11,345
But if you ever do
wake up with, like, a

350
00:16:11,573 --> 00:16:15,618
dolphin tattoo on your ankle,
just give me a call.

351
00:16:20,130 --> 00:16:22,465
There it is..
she's a mom.

352
00:16:23,671 --> 00:16:24,757
It's just not gonna happen.

353
00:16:24,961 --> 00:16:26,245
Sorry, dude.

354
00:16:27,463 --> 00:16:28,536
Have a shrimp.

355
00:16:28,643 --> 00:16:29,468
I'm good.

356
00:16:31,010 --> 00:16:32,586
I guess I got
no one but myself to blame.

357
00:16:32,690 --> 00:16:36,028
She told me right from the start she was
gonna say no and sure enough...

358
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:39,086
Wait a minute.

359
00:16:43,790 --> 00:16:45,428
- Hi.
- Hi.

360
00:16:45,883 --> 00:16:47,787
You didn't actually say no.

361
00:16:47,891 --> 00:16:48,655
What do you mean?

362
00:16:48,860 --> 00:16:51,558
All this time you were, uh, you were
supposed to say no, but you didn't...

363
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:52,618
I checked the transcript.

364
00:16:53,883 --> 00:16:57,165
So, here's what I'm proposing.
Uh... You only have two minutes, right?

365
00:16:57,373 --> 00:16:58,068
Right.

366
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:01,588
Okay. You want to, uh...
go on a a two-minute date with me?

367
00:17:03,452 --> 00:17:06,296
Last two-minute date I had
gave me a daughter.

368
00:17:06,481 --> 00:17:08,795
But um... Okay.

369
00:17:09,001 --> 00:17:09,705
Great.

370
00:17:12,171 --> 00:17:14,425
And... go.

371
00:17:14,802 --> 00:17:16,636
Taxi!

372
00:17:18,016 --> 00:17:18,986
Ranjit: Hello!

373
00:17:19,071 --> 00:17:21,388
- I seriously only have two minutes...
- I know.

374
00:17:23,551 --> 00:17:25,026
That's like 120 seconds.

375
00:17:25,132 --> 00:17:26,946
380 West 22nd, please.

376
00:17:27,151 --> 00:17:28,245
And step on it.
We're in a hurry.

377
00:17:28,510 --> 00:17:30,858
380 West 22nd? That's...

378
00:17:34,552 --> 00:17:36,805
- Right this way.
- Thank you, sir.

379
00:17:37,243 --> 00:17:39,458
You know, I have always wanted
to try this place.

380
00:17:40,021 --> 00:17:41,476
House salad.

381
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:43,455
- So, college?
- Stanford.

382
00:17:43,983 --> 00:17:46,157
- Wesleyan.
- Oh my god, do you know Adam Lazar?

383
00:17:46,263 --> 00:17:48,275
No. Scott Crable?

384
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:51,496
Wendy: Eggplant parmesean.
- Thanks.

385
00:17:51,601 --> 00:17:53,648
- Already cut up.
- Could we get the check please.

386
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:55,396
We're trying to make
a movie in 15 seconds.

387
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:56,746
- Of course.
- Okay, great.

388
00:17:56,851 --> 00:17:57,936
Uh, how do you want to do this?

389
00:17:58,042 --> 00:18:00,726
You had the eggplant parm.
I only really had water so...

390
00:18:00,831 --> 00:18:01,858
I'm kidding.

391
00:18:02,390 --> 00:18:04,478
Okay. Let's go.
Taxi!

392
00:18:05,651 --> 00:18:06,886
- You nervous?
- A little bit.

393
00:18:06,991 --> 00:18:08,637
- You can't tell at all.
- Oh, good.

394
00:18:08,853 --> 00:18:10,668
Ranjit: Hello!

395
00:18:17,202 --> 00:18:19,195
384 West 22nd.

396
00:18:19,741 --> 00:18:23,556
- 15 seconds. The movie's started.
- Nah, previews. We'll be fine.

397
00:18:26,083 --> 00:18:28,588
Ah! Just in time.
It hasn't started yet.

398
00:18:28,691 --> 00:18:31,055
- So, what are we seeing?
- Manos: Hands of Fate.

399
00:18:31,230 --> 00:18:34,056
- The whole thing?
- Only the important parts.

400
00:18:39,943 --> 00:18:42,015
Worst movie ever.

401
00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:44,376
Yeah, I almost walked out,
like, five times.

402
00:18:44,491 --> 00:18:47,535
- How we doing on time? Taxi!
- We got a little time.

403
00:18:47,641 --> 00:18:49,876
- Okay. Do you want to walk it?
- Why not?

404
00:18:49,981 --> 00:18:50,996
Ranjit: Hello!

405
00:18:51,712 --> 00:18:53,268
Good-bye!

406
00:18:53,970 --> 00:18:55,407
So what grade's your daughter in?

407
00:18:55,513 --> 00:18:57,296
- Third grade.
- Ah! That's a good year.

408
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:58,605
Yeah, she's wonderful.

409
00:18:58,712 --> 00:19:01,077
I just wish that I could get her
to quit smoking, you know?

410
00:19:01,183 --> 00:19:03,435
- What?
- I'm kidding.

411
00:19:03,602 --> 00:19:05,347
Look, coffee and dessert?

412
00:19:05,632 --> 00:19:07,948
You know, this neighborhood
just keeps on changing.

413
00:19:08,123 --> 00:19:09,717
This used to be a cute,
little Italian restaurant.

414
00:19:09,821 --> 00:19:10,746
I know. New York.

415
00:19:10,850 --> 00:19:14,538
It's a living organism, an ever-changing
tapestry. Ooh, look at the time.

416
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:17,016
- Let's go.
- The cheesecake's amazing.

417
00:19:18,783 --> 00:19:20,625
- Flowers?
- I'm allergic.

418
00:19:20,932 --> 00:19:24,038
Okay. See? We're getting
to know each other.

419
00:19:24,143 --> 00:19:28,028
Stella, I had a lovely...
Doggy bag?

420
00:19:28,591 --> 00:19:32,008
- Stella, I had a lovely time.
- Me, too, Ted.

421
00:19:32,273 --> 00:19:35,097
And... date.
Huh?

422
00:19:35,383 --> 00:19:39,155
That wasn't so bad, right?
No lengthy, awkward silences.

423
00:19:39,261 --> 00:19:43,865
Dessert ran a little long, so...
I had to cut the good-night kiss.

424
00:19:44,392 --> 00:19:47,787
I think I can be late just once.

425
00:19:59,373 --> 00:20:02,218
Look, I would love to have
a second date, I would.

426
00:20:02,411 --> 00:20:06,256
But I understand that you really don't
have time right now, but if you ever do,

427
00:20:06,361 --> 00:20:07,518
will you give me a call?

428
00:20:08,203 --> 00:20:09,895
- Yes.
- Okay.

429
00:20:13,301 --> 00:20:17,487
<i>And that, kids, is how
you turn a "no" into a "yes."</i>

430
00:20:21,192 --> 00:20:22,897
All my friends told me,
"Abby, be strong.

431
00:20:23,003 --> 00:20:25,698
He doesn't deserve another chance."
But I forgive you!

432
00:20:25,802 --> 00:20:27,055
No, no, no, no!

433
00:20:31,076 --> 00:20:34,401
He seemed so nice but then
he just kept toying with my emotions.

434
00:20:35,724 --> 00:20:37,999
This Ted guy sounds like a real jerk.

435
00:20:38,387 --> 00:20:41,629
You know your problem?
You're too sweet.

436
00:20:41,835 --> 00:20:43,800
Aren't you going to see
the doctor about that mole?

437
00:20:44,127 --> 00:20:46,629
Oh, yeah.
Turns out it's just a Raisinet.

438
00:20:48,554 --> 00:20:52,272
Hey, how would you like me
to take you out to a fancy restaurant

439
00:20:52,374 --> 00:20:54,592
and then go on a shopping spree?

440
00:20:54,694 --> 00:20:56,940
Treat you the way
you should be treated.

441
00:20:57,046 --> 00:20:59,229
Would that make you forget
about that Ted monster?

442
00:21:00,005 --> 00:21:02,859
My mom was wrong.
There are nice guys in New York.

443
00:21:04,124 --> 00:21:06,182
We just have to go
by my hotel room first.

444
00:21:06,284 --> 00:21:09,071
My bed was broken.
I just have to make sure they fixed it.

445
00:21:09,714 --> 00:21:11,852
Well, then if it's fixed,
can we have sex on it

446
00:21:11,885 --> 00:21:14,002
and then go shopping?

447
00:21:15,707 --> 00:21:16,712
I like you.
