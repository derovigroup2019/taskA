1
00:00:00,650 --> 00:00:04,555
Kids I know you think you
have ever heard of a story

2
00:00:05,050 --> 00:00:08,300
but there is some stories you tell
and some stories you don't

3
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:11,400
Oh, my God!...

4
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:13,205
- Oh, my God...
- Use your words, Ted.

5
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:17,340
- Okay. Barney, I'm about to go for the belt.
- The belt?

6
00:00:17,342 --> 00:00:20,560
- The belt.
- But that's impossible

7
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:25,500
Yes!

8
00:00:25,605 --> 00:00:28,795
- Advantage-- Ericksen.
- Don't get cocky.

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,290
- Wimbledon lasts a fortnight.
- "Fortnight."

10
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:35,425
- British words are so cool.
- Plus, did you know lawyers there get to wear wigs?

11
00:00:36,530 --> 00:00:38,235
All right.
We're ready. Let's hit it.

12
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:39,400
We can't go. Tournament.

13
00:00:39,404 --> 00:00:41,150
What? We agreed.
I suited up...

14
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:42,420
You take too long to get ready

15
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:45,500
What are you talking about?
I got the low maintenance, just-rolled-out-of-bed look.

16
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:49,985
Yeah, which takes an hour and a half
of waxing, tugging and teasing to achieve.

17
00:00:50,060 --> 00:00:51,140
And then he starts on his hair.

18
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:52,490
Ace!

19
00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:55,640
- Look, are we going or not?
- Just go without us.

20
00:00:55,707 --> 00:00:56,380
We'll be there in five minutes.

21
00:00:56,573 --> 00:00:57,707
Really?

22
00:00:57,772 --> 00:00:59,206
- Yes! Yes!
- All right,

23
00:00:59,273 --> 00:01:00,315
I'm going down to the bar.

24
00:01:00,316 --> 00:01:01,415
I'm ordering three beers.
I'll see you guys in

25
00:01:01,416 --> 00:01:03,282
five minutes.
Three beers,

26
00:01:03,283 --> 00:01:04,982
five minutes.

27
00:01:06,649 --> 00:01:08,215
Thanks for lending me
these boots.

28
00:01:08,282 --> 00:01:09,295
Where'd you get them from?

29
00:01:09,716 --> 00:01:12,016
This store in the Village
had one of those crazy sales.

30
00:01:12,083 --> 00:01:14,020
It was a footwear
feeding frenzy.

31
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,230
I saw it first!

32
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:21,750
You just made the list, bitch!

33
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:22,855
So many questions.

34
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:24,510
Firstly, what do you think
would happen

35
00:01:24,515 --> 00:01:26,665
if a guy walked into that store
wearing a suit of boots?

36
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,040
You look fantastic in them,
Robin.

37
00:01:30,333 --> 00:01:32,630
But don't you think they're
a little high for that dress?

38
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:33,874
Well, that's the point:
it's to hide that fact

39
00:01:33,941 --> 00:01:35,241
that I haven't
shaved my legs.

40
00:01:35,308 --> 00:01:37,208
I've begun
a strict no-shave policy

41
00:01:37,274 --> 00:01:38,374
for the first three dates.

42
00:01:38,441 --> 00:01:39,740
It's all about self-control.

43
00:01:39,807 --> 00:01:41,990
If I don't shave,
I must behave.

44
00:01:42,374 --> 00:01:44,041
FYI:It doesn't matter, baby.

45
00:01:44,108 --> 00:01:45,508
Guys just want to get
on the green.

46
00:01:45,575 --> 00:01:47,040
They don't mind going
through the rough.

47
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:48,780
Shh-clackey!

48
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:51,500
Stinson.

49
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:52,970
All right,
the beers are here.

50
00:01:53,416 --> 00:01:54,245
Yeah, we're not going
to make it.

51
00:01:54,550 --> 00:01:56,216
Oh, come on! We agreed...

52
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:57,935
Did Marshall take his pants off?

53
00:01:58,140 --> 00:01:59,039
Yeah, pants are off.

54
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:03,260
I need the freedom and mobility
that only underwear can provide.

55
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:04,300
Cheerio!

56
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:06,405
Fine.

57
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:08,020
I don't need friends.

58
00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:09,200
I got you guys.

59
00:02:09,205 --> 00:02:11,160
You guys are my friends,

60
00:02:11,165 --> 00:02:13,080
my cold refreshing friends.

61
00:02:13,985 --> 00:02:15,015
I'm talking to beer.

62
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:18,125
Ted? Trudy.

63
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,625
Trudy.

64
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:23,290
Oh, my God. I haven't
seen you since...

65
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,095
I slept with you and then
climbed down the fire escape.

66
00:02:28,267 --> 00:02:29,555
That was you?

67
00:02:29,933 --> 00:02:32,440
I'm kidding.
I was super-wasted.

68
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:34,550
These are not all for me.

69
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,555
No, I was going to call you,
but I was so embarrassed.

70
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:39,780
You were embarrassed?

71
00:02:39,785 --> 00:02:41,052
I was like,
"I really like this guy,

72
00:02:41,118 --> 00:02:42,418
"and now I'm climbing out
his window,

73
00:02:42,950 --> 00:02:44,555
and I forgot my underwear..."

74
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:45,800
Those were yours?

75
00:02:45,805 --> 00:02:47,505
God, I thought
they felt kind of tight.

76
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:49,175
I'm kidding.
I don't wear underwear.

77
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:50,620
Ladies' underwear.

78
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:51,900
Often.

79
00:02:51,905 --> 00:02:53,330
Ah! Again, I'm kidding.

80
00:02:54,450 --> 00:02:56,150
I'm so glad I ran into you.

81
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:58,260
I know. Do you want to...?
Trudy?!

82
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,100
No way!

83
00:03:00,105 --> 00:03:01,338
Oh, my God!
Rachel, how are you?

84
00:03:04,338 --> 00:03:05,700
Ted, this is Rachel.

85
00:03:05,705 --> 00:03:07,149
Hi!

86
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:09,225
Kappa Epsilon Gamma!
Kappa Epsilon Gamma!

87
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:10,125
Whoo!
Whoo!

88
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:12,045
Wait, let me guess.
You guys met in prison.

89
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:16,735
No! We were
sorority sisters.

90
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:18,973
And best friends forever
all sophomore year.

91
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:20,739
When we weren't
at each other's throats.

92
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:22,174
We could be so competitive.

93
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:24,115
Uh, but that's
all behind us now.

94
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:26,180
Hey, mista! Hey, mista!

95
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:28,100
Stay away from my sista!
Stay away from my sista!

96
00:03:28,105 --> 00:03:29,400
Whoo!
Whoo!

97
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:31,550
We have so much
catching up to do.

98
00:03:31,555 --> 00:03:32,922
Okay. Are you going
to Stacey's wedding?

99
00:03:32,925 --> 00:03:34,591
Oh, it's off. Apparently,
he's into dudes.

100
00:03:34,658 --> 00:03:36,725
Nah! Again?!
That's like her third one.

101
00:03:36,791 --> 00:03:37,750
I know!

102
00:03:38,905 --> 00:03:40,385
Well, beers,
what do you want to do?

103
00:03:40,438 --> 00:03:41,700
We could stay here...

104
00:03:41,705 --> 00:03:43,945
or I know this other place
called "My Belly."

105
00:03:43,950 --> 00:03:46,090
So, Trudy and I
got a table.

106
00:03:46,317 --> 00:03:47,783
Oh, that's cool. I was going
to get out of here anyway.

107
00:03:47,850 --> 00:03:48,760
I'm really tired.

108
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:50,705
I want you to stay.

109
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:53,575
Tired of people who fold early,
'cause I am wide awake!

110
00:03:56,850 --> 00:03:59,175
Okay, guys... be cool.

111
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:15,800
Aah!

112
00:04:15,805 --> 00:04:17,071
You've been
vanquished, old bean.

113
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,000
That's 'cause
you distracted me.

114
00:04:19,005 --> 00:04:21,785
You've been hanging crumpet
ever since the third set.

115
00:04:25,005 --> 00:04:26,538
Ah... Stinson.

116
00:04:26,539 --> 00:04:28,470
I've got a situation.

117
00:04:28,573 --> 00:04:31,625
Trudy is here-- you know,
from the pineapple incident?

118
00:04:31,706 --> 00:04:33,572
Oh, you mean the girl
that chalked your pool cue

119
00:04:33,573 --> 00:04:35,010
and then snuck down
the fire escape?

120
00:04:35,015 --> 00:04:36,270
Respect.

121
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:37,840
So, we're hitting it off
and then her friend shows up

122
00:04:37,841 --> 00:04:40,350
and they're
kind of competitive.

123
00:04:40,355 --> 00:04:41,835
HJI think the new girl's
kind of into me.

124
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:44,765
So you now have two on the line?

125
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,155
And I don't know
which one to go for.

126
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,450
Go for the new girl!

127
00:04:47,455 --> 00:04:49,470
Given the choice, always party
with Dr. Strangelove.

128
00:04:49,754 --> 00:04:50,740
New girl?
What new girl?

129
00:04:51,255 --> 00:04:52,740
Two girls are allegedly vying

130
00:04:52,745 --> 00:04:54,325
for Ted's affections,
and I think...

131
00:04:54,330 --> 00:04:55,785
Oh, you don't know
what you're talking about.

132
00:04:55,790 --> 00:04:56,700
Give it to me.

133
00:04:56,705 --> 00:04:57,785
Are they friends?

134
00:04:57,790 --> 00:05:00,300
Yeah. Uh, no-- I-I don't know.
They're old sorority sisters.

135
00:05:00,305 --> 00:05:01,300
Are they Betas?

136
00:05:01,305 --> 00:05:03,239
Because they're all sluts,
and you can tell them right now

137
00:05:03,305 --> 00:05:05,365
I didn't want to be
in their sorority anyway.

138
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,665
They're Kappas, and...

139
00:05:07,950 --> 00:05:09,155
I think I can score
with one of them.

140
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:10,200
I don't know which one,

141
00:05:10,205 --> 00:05:11,765
and if I chose wrong,
I lose them both.

142
00:05:11,839 --> 00:05:12,950
Okay, well, don't worry.

143
00:05:12,955 --> 00:05:14,755
I'll-I'll come down
and help you figure it out.

144
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:17,625
I thought we were in
for the evening?

145
00:05:17,730 --> 00:05:20,067
That's what I thought about your
bangers and mash down there,

146
00:05:20,096 --> 00:05:21,850
but I guess we're both wrong,
guv'na.

147
00:05:24,529 --> 00:05:25,885
Hey.
Oh, Ted. Okay...

148
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:27,900
Settle an argument.
Mm-hmm.

149
00:05:27,905 --> 00:05:30,070
Is it stealing if you go out
with someone's boyfriend

150
00:05:30,071 --> 00:05:31,485
after they've broken up?

151
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:33,450
Well, that's
very complicated...

152
00:05:33,455 --> 00:05:35,040
See?! He agrees with me.

153
00:05:35,045 --> 00:05:36,770
You're such a little man-thief.

154
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:38,580
You're the man-thief,
man-thief.

155
00:05:38,585 --> 00:05:40,605
Oh, somebody should lock
loyou girls up.

156
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:44,080
You're so funny.

157
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:46,380
I think Ted is funny.

158
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:50,900
Really?
I think Ted is hilarious.

159
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:53,370
I am never not wearing
a suit again.

160
00:05:53,852 --> 00:05:54,625
Hello?

161
00:05:54,630 --> 00:05:55,800
It's me. I'm at the bar.

162
00:05:55,805 --> 00:05:57,170
Don't look.
Just call me "Mom."

163
00:05:57,171 --> 00:06:00,604
Uh, hey, Mom.
How's Dad's... colon?

164
00:06:00,605 --> 00:06:02,740
What?
What's the matter with you?

165
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:06,505
Anyway, both of these girls
are into you; take your pick.

166
00:06:06,510 --> 00:06:08,810
They are? Are you sure?
Yes, of course.

167
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:10,886
They're playing with their hair
and touching your arm.

168
00:06:10,887 --> 00:06:12,185
Classic green light.

169
00:06:13,050 --> 00:06:13,875
Are you positive?

170
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:16,455
Oh, that is so  fascinating.

171
00:06:17,150 --> 00:06:18,455
So what happened?

172
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:19,980
Well, after 18
hours of surgery,

173
00:06:19,985 --> 00:06:21,000
I closed,
and, thankfully,

174
00:06:21,005 --> 00:06:23,071
both girls just celebrated
their second birthday.

175
00:06:23,072 --> 00:06:26,572
Wow. Gosh, separating
conjoined twins,

176
00:06:26,575 --> 00:06:29,355
that must be
the most amazing feeling.

177
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:31,232
True, but now the parents
don't know what to do

178
00:06:31,233 --> 00:06:33,530
with their huge supply
of four-legged overalls.

179
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,699
That is so funny.

180
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:38,250
You're so funny.

181
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:41,670
Positive.
They both want you bad.

182
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:44,190
It's a clearance sale
and you're the boots, baby.

183
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,900
Oh, it's Robin.
Good luck.

184
00:06:47,905 --> 00:06:48,500
Bye, Mom.

185
00:06:49,741 --> 00:06:50,635
That's my mom.

186
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,050
Hello?

187
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:52,925
Bring me a razor.

188
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:54,732
What about the no-shave rule?

189
00:06:54,739 --> 00:06:56,275
What happened
to your convictions?

190
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:59,430
They've been surgically removed
by Dr. Awesome.

191
00:06:59,930 --> 00:07:01,080
No, I'm not doing it.

192
00:07:01,085 --> 00:07:02,764
The whole point to not shaving
was to...

193
00:07:02,765 --> 00:07:04,364
Lily, please!
He's really cute,

194
00:07:04,365 --> 00:07:06,800
and I really like him,
and he's got a British accent.

195
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:07,765
I'm on my way.

196
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:11,100
So this college boyfriend,
who won him?

197
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:12,400
Neither of us.

198
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:15,425
He left.
Junior year abroad.

199
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,485
It's really
too bad, 'cause...

200
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:21,660
there was that one thing
we wanted to do.

201
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:23,232
We were
going to do...

202
00:07:23,233 --> 00:07:25,000
but we never did.

203
00:07:25,010 --> 00:07:28,143
Why? Wait, what were you guys
going to do but never did?

204
00:07:28,209 --> 00:07:29,410
No, it's too
embarrassing.

205
00:07:29,476 --> 00:07:30,799
You tell him.
No, you tell him.

206
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:31,932
No, I don't care
if you don't care.

207
00:07:31,999 --> 00:07:32,866
Well, I don't care. I just...

208
00:07:32,932 --> 00:07:34,985
Nobody cares! Just say it.

209
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:38,030
Why don't we tell him together.

210
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:38,970
Okay.

211
00:07:39,666 --> 00:07:41,075
On three.

212
00:07:41,980 --> 00:07:42,880
One...

213
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,790
Well, he's right:
it's a dead heat.

214
00:07:44,833 --> 00:07:46,680
...two...

215
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:47,899
Neither one is
giving ground.

216
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:49,620
I could not tell
who was the third wheel.

217
00:07:49,867 --> 00:07:51,233
...three.

218
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:52,965
It's a tricycle.

219
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:55,033
No way, no way, no way!

220
00:07:55,035 --> 00:07:55,660
What's happening?

221
00:07:56,900 --> 00:07:57,950
It's a tricycle.

222
00:07:57,954 --> 00:07:59,530
No way, no way, no way.

223
00:07:59,854 --> 00:08:00,855
It's a tricycle.

224
00:08:01,087 --> 00:08:02,299
Well, I'll just say it
right now.

225
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:04,190
All sorority girls are sluts.

226
00:08:04,367 --> 00:08:05,590
Put him on speaker.

227
00:08:06,135 --> 00:08:07,850
So what you're saying
to us right now

228
00:08:07,851 --> 00:08:09,685
is that you have
a shot at the belt?

229
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,198
Wait-wait-wait.
What belt?

230
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:12,766
Ho
Well, Barney and I have

231
00:08:12,767 --> 00:08:14,366
this running joke that the first
guy to actually pull this off

232
00:08:14,367 --> 00:08:16,199
would "win"
the championship belt.

233
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:19,200
Oh, so it's a metaphorical belt,
right?

234
00:08:19,850 --> 00:08:20,995
Behold...

235
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:24,190
You actually bought a belt.

236
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:25,845
That's right. It's resplendent.

237
00:08:27,050 --> 00:08:28,680
Come on, it was
just a thing we said.

238
00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:29,750
We were kidding around.

239
00:08:29,755 --> 00:08:30,715
I never kid.

240
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:32,300
Remember you said if I ever
slept with that girl

241
00:08:32,304 --> 00:08:33,765
from Days of Our Lives,
I'd be the king?

242
00:08:33,938 --> 00:08:34,950
Well...

243
00:08:39,437 --> 00:08:41,105
Why wasn't I told
about the belt?

244
00:08:41,171 --> 00:08:42,270
I could go for the belt.

245
00:08:45,770 --> 00:08:49,285
If Lily would've died before me,
then I could ride the tricycle.

246
00:08:49,369 --> 00:08:52,535
If I died, I would just come
back and haunt your penis.

247
00:08:52,536 --> 00:08:54,535
Guys, come on! Help me out.
What do I do?

248
00:08:54,536 --> 00:08:57,368
All right, Ted, if you're
going to go for the belt,

249
00:08:57,369 --> 00:08:59,850
then the bylaws require me
to ask the following questions:

250
00:08:59,855 --> 00:09:03,260
One: Is the aggregate age
of all participants under 83?

251
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:04,270
Yes.

252
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:06,365
Two: Is the aggregate weight
of all participants

253
00:09:06,366 --> 00:09:08,032
under 400 pounds?

254
00:09:08,033 --> 00:09:08,970
Yes.

255
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:10,740
Theodore Mosby...

256
00:09:11,234 --> 00:09:12,766
are you paying these women?

257
00:09:12,767 --> 00:09:14,315
What? No.

258
00:09:14,950 --> 00:09:16,355
Ted...

259
00:09:16,450 --> 00:09:17,617
No. Look, I got to go.
They're going to think

260
00:09:17,683 --> 00:09:20,420
I inherited my dad's imaginary
bathroom issues.

261
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:24,555
Oh, are you guys leaving?

262
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:27,735
Well, it is getting pretty late.

263
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:29,879
Right. Well, well, it's been...

264
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:31,746
Maybe we could all go
listen to that Wilco CD

265
00:09:31,813 --> 00:09:32,940
you talked about before.

266
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:36,646
Great! I have it right upstairs.

267
00:09:36,650 --> 00:09:38,855
It's in my apartment upstairs.
Let's go upstairs.

268
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:40,395
I'm sorry. Where was
your apartment again?

269
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:43,400
Ha, that's funny. I love that.

270
00:09:43,526 --> 00:09:45,695
You should tell more jokes
in my apartment upstenrs.

271
00:09:50,027 --> 00:09:53,126
Scenario #12:
We're in a horrific car crash.

272
00:09:53,193 --> 00:09:55,060
You die. I'm left paralyzed.

273
00:09:55,159 --> 00:09:57,660
Two sexy nurses,
with a six-pack of wine coolers,

274
00:09:57,727 --> 00:09:58,859
sneak into my room
late at night.

275
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:01,200
I try to blink at them in Morse code.

276
00:10:01,226 --> 00:10:05,210
"Please, don't. I love my dead wife."

277
00:10:05,226 --> 00:10:06,660
But they're medical
professionals,

278
00:10:06,727 --> 00:10:09,280
and I got to think, somehow,
they're saving my life.

279
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:11,859
Fine. Sleep with your nurses.

280
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:13,680
Tonight you ride the unicycle.

281
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:15,620
I already did this morning.

282
00:10:19,150 --> 00:10:19,700
Hello.

283
00:10:19,705 --> 00:10:22,705
Lily, I have pounded three
cappuccinos waiting for you.

284
00:10:22,771 --> 00:10:24,105
Pretty soon,
I won't have to shave--

285
00:10:24,172 --> 00:10:26,525
the hair is going to vibrate
off my legs.

286
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:28,310
I'm sorry, I can't leave now.

287
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:29,950
Lily, he can't see
my legs like this.

288
00:10:29,968 --> 00:10:31,685
I look like a Turkish lesbian.

289
00:10:33,101 --> 00:10:35,901
There's, um, a pharmacy
across the street.

290
00:10:35,968 --> 00:10:37,335
Would 20 bucks buy me a razor?

291
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:38,550
No, but 50 will.

292
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:42,865
Hold on. Ted's texting me.

293
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:46,350
"We're combing up-sars."

294
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:48,799
"Combing up-sars."
What does that mean?

295
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,960
It means they're
coming upstairs.

296
00:10:58,267 --> 00:10:59,501
Got 'em.

297
00:11:02,267 --> 00:11:05,080
Ooh! Nice place.

298
00:11:05,550 --> 00:11:07,067
Hey, are these
your roommates?

299
00:11:07,070 --> 00:11:09,720
Yes. Uh, yes,
but they are not here.

300
00:11:09,836 --> 00:11:11,310
They are somewhere else.

301
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:12,900
We have total privacy

302
00:11:12,905 --> 00:11:16,930
because privacy is essential
when you're listening to music.

303
00:11:17,845 --> 00:11:20,520
You know what else is essential
when you're listening to music?

304
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:23,015
Music.

305
00:11:23,266 --> 00:11:24,766
That's hilarious.

306
00:11:24,833 --> 00:11:25,965
You are hilarious!

307
00:11:26,099 --> 00:11:27,466
I'll go get it
in my bedroom.

308
00:11:27,533 --> 00:11:28,685
The CD's in my bedroom.

309
00:11:28,999 --> 00:11:30,059
Bedroom...

310
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:32,370
Okay. We'll try and stay out of trouble.

311
00:11:32,527 --> 00:11:34,015
Of course,
we can't promise anything.

312
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,750
This is going to be awesome.

313
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:43,410
No!

314
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,700
What are you guys doing here?

315
00:11:49,310 --> 00:11:50,842
We know, Ted, well done.

316
00:11:50,909 --> 00:11:52,243
This is very impressive.

317
00:11:52,310 --> 00:11:54,076
Up top.
Yeah, bro, up top.

318
00:11:54,143 --> 00:11:55,443
Oh, don't be gross.

319
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:57,099
You guys need to
get out of here.

320
00:11:57,100 --> 00:11:58,900
Please, take the fire escape.

321
00:11:58,966 --> 00:11:59,865
No, no way.

322
00:11:59,970 --> 00:12:01,750
The other day I saw
a pigeon take a crap on it

323
00:12:01,755 --> 00:12:03,775
and the whole thing shifted.

324
00:12:04,822 --> 00:12:06,250
Oh, you can use
our bedroom.

325
00:12:06,355 --> 00:12:07,855
Okay, all I need
to seal the deal

326
00:12:07,922 --> 00:12:09,410
is the Wilco CD, Barney.

327
00:12:14,321 --> 00:12:15,089
What are you doing?!

328
00:12:15,154 --> 00:12:17,288
allow Ted to do this.

329
00:12:17,355 --> 00:12:18,510
Wh-what? Why?

330
00:12:18,515 --> 00:12:20,347
Because the belt
is my birthright!

331
00:12:20,348 --> 00:12:21,782
You cannot claim it before I do.

332
00:12:21,849 --> 00:12:24,615
That would be like Jimmy Olsen
capturing Lex Luthor

333
00:12:24,682 --> 00:12:27,115
while Superman watches
impotently from the bedroom.

334
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:30,610
But, Barney, you've done
way dirtier stuff than Ted.

335
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:32,205
You're disgusting.

336
00:12:33,033 --> 00:12:34,775
I've never ridden the tricycle.

337
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:36,633
I was on the verge
last year.

338
00:12:36,634 --> 00:12:37,967
I was so close.

339
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:43,100
So ladies, why don't
we move this party

340
00:12:43,105 --> 00:12:45,480
to a more horizontal location?

341
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:48,205
Oh, my God,
my new carpet!

342
00:12:48,210 --> 00:12:49,510
Oh, my God, this
is a disaster.

343
00:12:49,515 --> 00:12:51,081
You get the carpet cleaner.
I'll get a towel.

344
00:12:51,085 --> 00:12:52,452
Okay.
I'll get the video camera.

345
00:12:52,517 --> 00:12:54,260
Get out!
Okay then.

346
00:12:54,751 --> 00:12:55,984
So let me get
this straight.

347
00:12:55,985 --> 00:12:57,583
You're going to trike-block me?

348
00:12:57,584 --> 00:13:00,280
That is so petty.
It's like you're...

349
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:02,750
Tom Petty.
Tom Petty.

350
00:13:02,755 --> 00:13:03,854
You're Tom Petty.

351
00:13:03,855 --> 00:13:05,025
Where's Lily?

352
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,100
Still looking for that CD,

353
00:13:10,350 --> 00:13:12,332
so...

354
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:15,484
What are you doing?

355
00:13:15,485 --> 00:13:17,353
I knew it.
I had a hunch about that girl

356
00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:18,520
and I was right.

357
00:13:18,652 --> 00:13:21,170
I saw it first!

358
00:13:22,950 --> 00:13:24,775
You just made the list, bitch.

359
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:28,865
I cannot give up my bedroom
to a boot thief.

360
00:13:28,970 --> 00:13:30,896
She should be punished,
not rewarded.

361
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:33,367
Fine, then I'll try to work in a little
light spanking. Just do this for me!

362
00:13:33,434 --> 00:13:34,430
No, never.

363
00:13:34,650 --> 00:13:36,382
What if I reimburse you
for the boots, full retail?

364
00:13:36,383 --> 00:13:38,590
- Please enjoy our bedroom.
- Great.

365
00:13:38,951 --> 00:13:39,690
Just take it.

366
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:41,490
Okay, wish me luck.

367
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,233
Oh, my God.
It looks fine.

368
00:13:50,234 --> 00:13:51,320
You're such a girl.

369
00:13:53,450 --> 00:13:54,433
Whe's the shaving cream?

370
00:13:54,435 --> 00:13:55,765
Well, you didn't ask me for shaving cream.

371
00:13:55,935 --> 00:13:56,950
Well, it was implied.

372
00:13:56,955 --> 00:13:58,689
Who buys a razor
without buying shaving cream?

373
00:13:58,756 --> 00:14:00,435
Well, who doesn't shave
their legs for a date?

374
00:14:00,522 --> 00:14:02,600
Well, who's not getting a tip
because of her attitude?

375
00:14:02,605 --> 00:14:04,005
Well, here's a little tip
for you:

376
00:14:04,072 --> 00:14:06,845
shave your legs before you leave
the house, Sasquatch.

377
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:13,472
Hey, Robin, um, the valet's
brought the car around.

378
00:14:13,474 --> 00:14:14,790
I thought we'd go to my place,

379
00:14:15,470 --> 00:14:16,699
if you're in the mood
for a nightcap.

380
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:19,840
Absolutely. I just have to go
to the ladies' room.

381
00:14:20,001 --> 00:14:20,980
I've got TB.

382
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:23,240
Tiny bladder.

383
00:14:24,340 --> 00:14:25,350
I'll meet you out front.

384
00:14:25,540 --> 00:14:26,300
Yeah.

385
00:14:41,206 --> 00:14:42,160
You've got to be kidding me.

386
00:14:45,470 --> 00:14:46,880
Excuse me. Sorry.

387
00:15:06,850 --> 00:15:08,825
So, I'm having a little
trouble finding the CD.

388
00:15:09,449 --> 00:15:11,125
That's okay.

389
00:15:11,780 --> 00:15:14,700
We don't need music to have fun.

390
00:15:14,714 --> 00:15:16,125
Exactly.

391
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:20,200
You do like to have
fun, don't you, Ted?

392
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:32,610
It's getting late.
I'll get your coats.

393
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,300
"I'll get your coats"?!

394
00:15:38,305 --> 00:15:39,972
I don't know why I said that.
Why'd I say that?

395
00:15:40,038 --> 00:15:41,305
It's the opposite
of what I meant.

396
00:15:41,372 --> 00:15:43,235
I wanna take clothes off them,
not put more on.

397
00:15:43,650 --> 00:15:46,325
Ted, you're ruining this
for everyone.

398
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:47,795
Leave him alone!

399
00:15:48,735 --> 00:15:49,750
Sometimes even

400
00:15:49,755 --> 00:15:51,900
the greatest warriors
shoot themselves in the foot.

401
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:53,885
What are you
talking about?

402
00:15:54,232 --> 00:15:57,867
If you must know, it wasn't
a freak beverage malfunction

403
00:15:57,870 --> 00:15:59,930
that stopped me from riding
the tricycle that night.

404
00:16:00,370 --> 00:16:02,270
So, Barney, why don't we

405
00:16:02,336 --> 00:16:05,630
take this party to a more
horizontal location?

406
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:20,220
Oh, no, the night's ruined!

407
00:16:20,225 --> 00:16:21,200
No, baby, it's not.

408
00:16:21,210 --> 00:16:23,700
Yes, it ! Whatever this night
was heading towards is ruined.

409
00:16:23,704 --> 00:16:24,590
Where's my coat?

410
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:28,036
Why would you do that
to yourself?

411
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:29,545
Because you get up
in your head, man.

412
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:31,474
You start thinking,

413
00:16:31,475 --> 00:16:33,475
"I can't do this.
It's two women."

414
00:16:33,541 --> 00:16:35,549
That's two of everything,
four of some things.

415
00:16:35,550 --> 00:16:38,640
The logistics alone are enough
to cripple even a pro like me.

416
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:41,005
See, if a complete degenerate
like Barney choked,

417
00:16:41,006 --> 00:16:42,450
what chance do I have?

418
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:45,330
The best chance in the world.

419
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:49,635
Fear took the belt from me.

420
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:53,985
Fear rode the tricycle
that night, my friends.

421
00:16:54,860 --> 00:16:56,690
But fear will not get
a second turn.

422
00:16:57,900 --> 00:16:59,135
- It won't?
- No.

423
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:03,255
Because I now realize it isn't
my destiny to win the belt.

424
00:17:03,941 --> 00:17:07,074
It is my destiny to help
my friend win it.

425
00:17:08,041 --> 00:17:11,085
Ted is fated
to go there first.

426
00:17:12,107 --> 00:17:14,195
He is our Neil Armstrong.

427
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:16,908
Spacesuit up, Ted,

428
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:17,999
'cause you're going
to the moon.

429
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:18,925
Step one.

430
00:17:22,143 --> 00:17:23,240
Ladies.

431
00:17:23,643 --> 00:17:24,844
I couldn't find your coats,

432
00:17:24,850 --> 00:17:27,117
but I did find... tequila.

433
00:17:30,383 --> 00:17:31,985
Wait, wait, wait,
a remote control fireplace?

434
00:17:32,383 --> 00:17:33,885
We don'Hot have
a remote control fireplace.

435
00:17:33,917 --> 00:17:35,500
Right, that's my apartment.

436
00:17:35,517 --> 00:17:36,900
The dressing gown's mine, too.

437
00:17:36,950 --> 00:17:38,140
Damn, this should be me.

438
00:17:38,383 --> 00:17:39,400
Anyway, continuing...

439
00:17:42,216 --> 00:17:44,216
Whew!

440
00:17:45,884 --> 00:17:48,483
I am so exhausted.

441
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,705
So exhausted.

442
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:53,895
Wait, why would I want
to tire them out?

443
00:17:54,050 --> 00:17:56,397
That's your excuse
to unleash pretext

444
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:57,910
for physical contact #1.

445
00:17:59,534 --> 00:18:04,635
Oh, you give
the most amazing foot massage.

446
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:06,800
That's 'cause I used to practice

447
00:18:06,804 --> 00:18:08,655
all the time on my grandmother.

448
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:11,465
Why in God's name
would I say that?

449
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:13,285
It's endearing.
You're a caregiver.

450
00:18:13,533 --> 00:18:15,620
Never take family values
out of the equation.

451
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:16,420
Step three.

452
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:20,433
Ted, what's wrong?

453
00:18:20,435 --> 00:18:24,175
I was just thinking about
this documentary I saw once

454
00:18:25,470 --> 00:18:27,555
about something
called a super volcano.

455
00:18:28,837 --> 00:18:30,100
Okay, what the hell?

456
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:30,975
Wait for it.

457
00:18:31,450 --> 00:18:32,995
It can happen at any time.

458
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:35,930
And obliterate
all life on Earth,

459
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:39,105
which is why
I live by three simple words.

460
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:44,200
Don't postpone joy.

461
00:18:45,301 --> 00:18:46,595
Oh, my God.

462
00:18:47,468 --> 00:18:49,020
That's so true.

463
00:18:49,367 --> 00:18:50,570
Yeah.

464
00:18:54,167 --> 00:18:55,490
The mortality angle.

465
00:18:55,633 --> 00:18:56,875
That's actually pretty good.

466
00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:00,760
- I can do this.
- Yes, you can.

467
00:19:00,883 --> 00:19:03,016
Yeah. I can't believe I'm
going to say this,

468
00:19:03,083 --> 00:19:04,648
but I'm actually moved.

469
00:19:04,649 --> 00:19:05,840
Bring it in, guys.

470
00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:11,555
All right.

471
00:19:15,230 --> 00:19:16,555
I'll see you on the other side.

472
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,910
So what happened next?
Did you do it?

473
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,395
It doesn't seem right
to talk about it.

474
00:19:54,030 --> 00:19:55,960
What? No! Tell me.

475
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:59,425
Don't tell me
because you don't have to

476
00:19:59,430 --> 00:20:00,690
because you didn't do it.

477
00:20:01,596 --> 00:20:03,395
You didn't do it.
You did it.

478
00:20:03,396 --> 00:20:04,862
You did it, didn't you?

479
00:20:04,863 --> 00:20:05,925
Did you?

480
00:20:06,650 --> 00:20:07,600
You didn't do it.

481
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:09,416
Yes, you did.
You did.

482
00:20:09,483 --> 00:20:10,483
No, you didn't.

483
00:20:10,549 --> 00:20:11,510
Tell me!

484
00:20:12,483 --> 00:20:14,800
Some stories you tell,
some stories you don't.

485
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:17,790
That's because you didn't do it.

486
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:19,340
He didn't do it.

487
00:20:20,050 --> 00:20:21,683
You did it
You did it, didn't you?

488
00:20:21,684 --> 00:20:22,930
You did it.
Tell me, did you?

489
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:24,900
Ted, belt. Did you?

490
00:20:24,903 --> 00:20:26,030
Did you or didn't you?

491
00:20:26,070 --> 00:20:27,105
Did?

492
00:20:27,537 --> 00:20:29,275
Tell me, please.
For the love...

493
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:30,615
Do you know
if he did or didn't?

494
00:20:32,533 --> 00:20:33,700
Oh, hey, um,
Hmm?

495
00:20:33,705 --> 00:20:35,435
would you go in there
and see if my date's okay?

496
00:20:36,215 --> 00:20:37,180
No problem.

497
00:20:37,247 --> 00:20:37,840
Thank you.

498
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:49,720
No, nobody's in there,
but the window's actually open.

499
00:20:50,510 --> 00:20:52,100
I guess I shouldn't be
so surprised.

500
00:20:52,104 --> 00:20:53,970
I mean, she was acting weird
all night, right?

501
00:20:53,975 --> 00:20:56,160
Yeah, you know...

502
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:58,760
why don't I buy you a drink?

503
00:20:59,767 --> 00:21:00,745
Okay.

504
00:21:01,470 --> 00:21:03,445
Did I overhear
that you're a surgeon?

505
00:21:03,737 --> 00:21:05,220
Guilty as charged.

506
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:07,455
Oh, you're so funny.

507
00:21:09,167 --> 00:21:10,200
I'm here!

508
00:21:10,267 --> 00:21:11,586
I'm fine!

509
00:21:12,233 --> 00:21:13,685
My head is bleeding.

510
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:15,255
Going down again.
