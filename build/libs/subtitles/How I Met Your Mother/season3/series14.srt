1
00:00:01,380 --> 00:00:03,182
<i>Kids, back when we were younger,</i>

2
00:00:03,302 --> 00:00:06,328
<i>your uncle Marshall and I
were really into college basketball.</i>

3
00:00:06,448 --> 00:00:09,405
<i>Every year, March Madness would
take over the entire apartment.</i>

4
00:00:09,525 --> 00:00:12,394
- Hey. What's with the blackboard?
- It's our NCAA bracket.

5
00:00:12,514 --> 00:00:14,951
Big board equals big luck!

6
00:00:15,674 --> 00:00:18,526
Hey, that looks familiar.
Where did you get it?

7
00:00:20,774 --> 00:00:21,488
Hello.

8
00:00:21,748 --> 00:00:23,178
I'm looking for my wife, Ms. Aldrin.

9
00:00:23,555 --> 00:00:25,400
There's no school today.
It's a Saturday.

10
00:00:26,341 --> 00:00:28,244
Of course. How could I forget?

11
00:00:28,366 --> 00:00:29,367
Dumbass.

12
00:00:39,114 --> 00:00:41,179
- Big board!
- Big luck!

13
00:00:41,763 --> 00:00:43,370
We found it.
No big deal.

14
00:00:43,793 --> 00:00:46,246
Anyway, every year,
Ted and I go in together on this

15
00:00:46,352 --> 00:00:48,134
big money pool out in Staten Island.

16
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:51,237
The winner gets
$100,000 stuffed in a duffel bag.

17
00:00:51,339 --> 00:00:54,007
And you get to keep the duffel bag.

18
00:00:54,209 --> 00:00:57,895
Why do you guys put yourselves
through this? You lose every year.

19
00:00:58,001 --> 00:00:59,857
That's because in the past,
we were just guessing.

20
00:00:59,959 --> 00:01:01,645
This year, we watched every game,

21
00:01:01,681 --> 00:01:03,535
read box scores, tracked injuries.

22
00:01:03,641 --> 00:01:05,065
This isn't March Madness.

23
00:01:05,169 --> 00:01:08,106
This is March
Meticulously Thought-outness.

24
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:09,937
Your team lost 20 minutes ago.

25
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:15,026
I didn't know
they were playing today.

26
00:01:16,691 --> 00:01:17,697
You okay, Barney?

27
00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:20,035
Something strange is going on.

28
00:01:20,722 --> 00:01:23,407
I was down at the hardware store trying
to get a little somethin' somethin'.

29
00:01:23,740 --> 00:01:26,456
Wait. You go to the hardware store to pick up girls?

30
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:29,807
There are four kinds of women who go
to the hardware store by themselves.

31
00:01:29,909 --> 00:01:31,047
Of course there are.

32
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:34,924
Single, recently single,
recently divorced,

33
00:01:35,029 --> 00:01:36,754
lesbian who will let me watch.

34
00:01:36,959 --> 00:01:38,466
You could not be more evil.

35
00:01:38,779 --> 00:01:41,346
Sorry. Five.
Recently widowed.

36
00:01:43,061 --> 00:01:44,266
So, I'm talking to this girl...

37
00:01:44,932 --> 00:01:47,187
Look, I'm sure he's in a better place.

38
00:01:47,739 --> 00:01:50,146
Now let's find you a sturdier ladder.

39
00:01:52,259 --> 00:01:54,185
I was only gone for a second when...

40
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,374
See? Skid-proof.

41
00:01:59,922 --> 00:02:02,155
The same thing happened
at the pet store yesterday.

42
00:02:02,459 --> 00:02:03,247
Pet store?

43
00:02:03,449 --> 00:02:06,434
Single girl, mid-twenties, looking for
a canine replacement for the boyfriend

44
00:02:06,542 --> 00:02:08,744
who just dumped her.
Instead, finds Barney.

45
00:02:09,341 --> 00:02:11,667
God bless you, Ted.
You're reading my blog.

46
00:02:13,621 --> 00:02:15,006
I'm really bored at work.

47
00:02:15,979 --> 00:02:19,634
I'd call your ex a dog, but that would
be an insult to little Ladybug here.

48
00:02:19,842 --> 00:02:21,557
I want to take her home right now.

49
00:02:22,361 --> 00:02:25,175
Not without a chew toy
from Uncle Barney first.

50
00:02:28,251 --> 00:02:29,627
<i>And when I got back...</i>

51
00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:33,514
I'm sorry, I'm already spoiling her,
but, Diamond in the ruff?

52
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:34,934
Could your heart just melt?

53
00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:35,894
Jerk!

54
00:02:38,529 --> 00:02:39,305
Weird, right?

55
00:02:39,769 --> 00:02:42,946
The same thing happened
last week at the museum.

56
00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:44,614
Lily.

57
00:02:44,819 --> 00:02:47,827
You pretend to be a struggling
young artist who needs a new muse.

58
00:02:48,031 --> 00:02:49,516
No.
Marsh.

59
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:52,074
You're a millionaire art thief
casing the joint for a thrill

60
00:02:52,182 --> 00:02:53,666
money can no longer give you!

61
00:02:53,871 --> 00:02:54,704
Oh. No.
Robin.

62
00:02:54,911 --> 00:02:58,075
You're going blind, and you're trying
to soak up all the beauty in the world

63
00:02:58,182 --> 00:02:59,544
before the darkness descends.

64
00:02:59,671 --> 00:03:00,437
Bingo!

65
00:03:01,339 --> 00:03:02,715
So, I was talking to this girl.

66
00:03:03,470 --> 00:03:05,424
At this point, about 83%.

67
00:03:06,730 --> 00:03:09,345
Soon, these audio guides
will be all that I have left.

68
00:03:09,651 --> 00:03:11,554
I'm so sorry.

69
00:03:13,931 --> 00:03:16,065
My God, you are beautiful.

70
00:03:18,022 --> 00:03:22,155
How about I get you a headset so
you can see with your ears like I do?

71
00:03:29,201 --> 00:03:32,584
<i>I couldn't have been gone more than
20 seconds, but when I came back...</i>

72
00:03:33,251 --> 00:03:35,167
I also love the smell of great art.

73
00:03:38,542 --> 00:03:40,265
Why does this keep happening?

74
00:03:40,372 --> 00:03:43,185
Maybe you're not as good a liar
as you think you are.

75
00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:46,665
Oh, really? Then why am I not
in prison for perjury?

76
00:03:46,771 --> 00:03:48,176
But I don't want to talk about work.

77
00:03:49,429 --> 00:03:52,096
Something weird is going on here.

78
00:03:52,711 --> 00:03:54,766
<i>But the next night
got even weirder.</i>

79
00:03:56,170 --> 00:03:58,434
Alan Alda.
It was Alan Alda.

80
00:03:58,439 --> 00:04:00,446
You're never gonna believe
what just happened.

81
00:04:02,321 --> 00:04:05,025
Who was that, um,
guy from Mash?

82
00:04:05,451 --> 00:04:07,374
The main guy. What...?

83
00:04:07,421 --> 00:04:09,456
Hawkeye from Mash.
How can I be blanking on this?

84
00:04:09,742 --> 00:04:10,664
Alan Alda?

85
00:04:11,401 --> 00:04:12,137
No.

86
00:04:15,881 --> 00:04:18,047
<i>Hey, a word of advice?</i>

87
00:04:18,150 --> 00:04:20,444
<i>That guy you were talking to,
Barney Stinson...</i>

88
00:04:20,550 --> 00:04:21,805
<i>I know he seems charming,</i>

89
00:04:21,912 --> 00:04:24,157
<i>but he's just saying whatever
it takes to get in your pants.</i>

90
00:04:24,262 --> 00:04:27,217
<i>Sleeping with Barney was
the biggest mistake of my life.</i>

91
00:04:30,829 --> 00:04:32,576
Oh, my God.
Where is she?

92
00:04:34,892 --> 00:04:36,104
She must have left.

93
00:04:36,592 --> 00:04:38,726
Well, she-she said
I hooked up with her?

94
00:04:38,829 --> 00:04:40,027
What was her name?
What did she look like?

95
00:04:40,131 --> 00:04:43,874
She didn't say her name,
but she had blonde hair, boobs.

96
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:44,735
Kind of trashy.

97
00:04:45,549 --> 00:04:48,155
Dead in the eyes with an aura of
self-loathing and despair?

98
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:49,575
That's all of them.

99
00:04:50,452 --> 00:04:51,656
Okay. Stay calm.

100
00:04:51,949 --> 00:04:53,486
Let's think this through.

101
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:58,367
One of the girls who I lied to, seduced
and abandoned is trying to ruin my life.

102
00:04:58,592 --> 00:05:01,245
Shouldn't be too hard
to figure out which one it is.

103
00:05:10,879 --> 00:05:12,144
Oh, dear God!

<i>How I Met Your Mother
3x14 - The Bracket</i>

107
00:05:23,452 --> 00:05:25,966
<i>for the "Have You Met Team"
for www.forom.com</i>

108
00:05:28,432 --> 00:05:30,026
This is a nightmare.

109
00:05:30,244 --> 00:05:33,336
Some woman that I slept with and
screwed over is trying to ruin my life.

110
00:05:33,444 --> 00:05:34,956
God, why is this happening to me?

111
00:05:35,061 --> 00:05:35,909
It's karma.

112
00:05:36,253 --> 00:05:37,767
Nah, it's not Karma.

113
00:05:38,051 --> 00:05:41,208
She's strippg in Vegas.
Plus, we're good.

114
00:05:42,242 --> 00:05:44,327
Look, if you want to figure out
who it is, why don't you just

115
00:05:44,431 --> 00:05:45,548
start by checking your list?

116
00:05:46,032 --> 00:05:46,918
My list?

117
00:05:47,332 --> 00:05:50,066
Dude, do not pretend
you're not the kind of guy

118
00:05:50,171 --> 00:05:52,136
who keeps a list of all the girls
he's slept with.

119
00:05:52,432 --> 00:05:53,698
I have one.

120
00:05:53,802 --> 00:05:56,716
It's called my marriage license.

121
00:05:57,153 --> 00:05:58,839
Come on, let's see the list.

122
00:05:59,241 --> 00:06:00,768
Ted, don't be crass.

123
00:06:01,471 --> 00:06:03,496
I would never demean
the women that I've slept with

124
00:06:03,603 --> 00:06:06,566
by putting their names
on some tawdry list.

125
00:06:06,824 --> 00:06:09,008
This is a scrapbook of all of
the women I've slept with.

126
00:06:09,601 --> 00:06:13,568
I made it at the Scrapbook Barn on 7th.
Ask for Heloise. Tell her I sent you.

127
00:06:15,473 --> 00:06:16,567
What do you think, Lil?

128
00:06:16,674 --> 00:06:18,249
You recognize the saboteur?

129
00:06:18,454 --> 00:06:20,916
I don't know, Barney.
I only saw her face.

130
00:06:22,024 --> 00:06:23,947
How many of these girls know
they're being photographed?

131
00:06:24,242 --> 00:06:27,728
All of them, but only about half
buy a copy on the way out.

132
00:06:28,652 --> 00:06:32,018
Barney, you're never gonna figure out
which one of these is the mystery woman.

133
00:06:32,122 --> 00:06:34,046
All of these women
have a right to hate you.

134
00:06:34,253 --> 00:06:36,478
Oh, Lily, come on, lighten up.
I mean, any girl

135
00:06:36,581 --> 00:06:40,247
who's gonna be with a guy
like Barney and do this or

136
00:06:40,404 --> 00:06:44,506
that, or this and that,
or do this with those in that...

137
00:06:44,723 --> 00:06:46,868
I mean, she should have known
what she was getting into.

138
00:06:46,972 --> 00:06:48,559
Absolutely.

139
00:06:48,701 --> 00:06:53,068
And what I do with these women
should be between me and them.

140
00:06:54,114 --> 00:06:55,158
And you guys.

141
00:06:55,614 --> 00:06:58,659
And Heloise.
She helped me do the decoupage.

142
00:06:59,033 --> 00:07:01,327
I don't know, Barney.
I don't recognize any of these women.

143
00:07:01,434 --> 00:07:05,306
I mean, some minor celebrities,
one government official,

144
00:07:05,598 --> 00:07:08,849
and what appears to be
a national fast food chain mascot.

145
00:07:10,676 --> 00:07:12,491
This is impossible.

146
00:07:12,595 --> 00:07:14,012
There's too many girls.

147
00:07:14,115 --> 00:07:15,639
How the hell am I gonna
narrow this down?

148
00:07:16,052 --> 00:07:19,268
The top 64 women I've slept with,
split into four regions.

149
00:07:19,592 --> 00:07:21,696
This tournament will
systematically narrow down

150
00:07:21,802 --> 00:07:23,898
which girl has the most cause
to hate my guts.

151
00:07:24,002 --> 00:07:25,936
Last girl standing
has to be the saboteur.

152
00:07:26,282 --> 00:07:29,196
Absolutely not, Barney.
We are not going to make a game out

153
00:07:29,304 --> 00:07:31,438
of the women you've tricked
into sleeping with you.

154
00:07:36,083 --> 00:07:36,948
No way!

155
00:07:37,683 --> 00:07:39,618
The girl who thought
he had 12 hours to live

156
00:07:39,723 --> 00:07:41,489
has way more cause to ruin his life

157
00:07:41,533 --> 00:07:42,837
than the girl he fake proposed to.

158
00:07:42,941 --> 00:07:44,909
It's Fake Proposal Girl.

159
00:07:45,012 --> 00:07:46,997
I mean, she hired a wedding planner!

160
00:07:47,104 --> 00:07:49,456
It's 12 hours to live!
That girl flew them both to Paris!

161
00:07:49,583 --> 00:07:51,376
Oh, she only bought him
a one-way ticket!

162
00:07:52,343 --> 00:07:54,628
Okay, okay, everybody!
Hands.

163
00:07:54,963 --> 00:07:56,376
12 hours to live!

164
00:07:56,481 --> 00:07:57,528
Damn it!

165
00:07:59,254 --> 00:08:00,376
Okay, toss up.

166
00:08:00,481 --> 00:08:03,767
"Thought I was Jorge Posada,"
or "You have my dead wife's kidney?"

167
00:08:03,971 --> 00:08:05,729
- Kidney!
- Jorge Posada!

168
00:08:05,933 --> 00:08:08,226
She bought Yankees season tickets
to watch him play!

169
00:08:08,432 --> 00:08:10,079
- That's true...
- It's Dead Wife's Kidney.

170
00:08:10,182 --> 00:08:12,028
How are we even discussing this?

171
00:08:13,491 --> 00:08:17,078
- Fake Baby!
- Lost at Sea!

172
00:08:17,183 --> 00:08:19,408
I was there.
Trust me.

173
00:08:20,053 --> 00:08:21,337
It's Fake Baby.

174
00:08:23,103 --> 00:08:24,526
Down to the sweet 16.

175
00:08:24,631 --> 00:08:26,109
And coming out
of the Upper West Side,

176
00:08:26,213 --> 00:08:29,296
we have the number three seed,
"Girl who thought I owned Google,"

177
00:08:29,402 --> 00:08:33,206
up against the number seven seed, "Girl
who thought I was a scuba instructor."

178
00:08:33,852 --> 00:08:35,876
- You got to go Scuba Instructor.
- You're kidding me!

179
00:08:35,983 --> 00:08:38,476
- She got the bends!
- Yeah, she did.

180
00:08:39,612 --> 00:08:42,447
Boo.

181
00:08:42,942 --> 00:08:44,989
- Evil Twin!
- Prince of Norway!

182
00:08:45,091 --> 00:08:48,516
- How could it not be Prince of Norway?!
- Barney, you're the tiebreaker.

183
00:08:49,403 --> 00:08:51,689
- I'm going with Evil Twin.
- You're kidding me!

184
00:08:51,892 --> 00:08:56,818
Sorry, but I did sleep with that girl
twice. As Barney and Larney.

185
00:09:02,544 --> 00:09:05,348
Okay, we're down to the Final Four.

186
00:09:05,451 --> 00:09:07,789
What do you think, people?
Come on, dig deep.

187
00:09:08,111 --> 00:09:11,126
Oh! I can't decide.
It could be any one of them.

188
00:09:11,841 --> 00:09:14,506
Is that the blackboard
from my classroom?

189
00:09:15,022 --> 00:09:16,376
Come on! Marshall?

190
00:09:17,041 --> 00:09:19,298
I'm tired and sad.

191
00:09:20,104 --> 00:09:20,798
Mosby?

192
00:09:22,074 --> 00:09:23,828
I want to call my mom,

193
00:09:24,302 --> 00:09:25,557
just tell her I love her.

194
00:09:28,914 --> 00:09:30,858
Then this is as far as we get.

195
00:09:31,154 --> 00:09:32,398
The Final Four.

196
00:09:32,893 --> 00:09:35,808
It's got to be Meg, Anna,

197
00:09:36,063 --> 00:09:38,497
Kate or Holly.

198
00:09:38,602 --> 00:09:40,419
We are gonna track these girls down,

199
00:09:40,524 --> 00:09:42,946
and you're going to tell me which one
approached you at the bar.

200
00:09:43,051 --> 00:09:45,196
You guys stole my blackboard!

201
00:09:52,351 --> 00:09:53,656
Okay, there's her building.

202
00:09:53,762 --> 00:09:55,738
When she comes out,
I'm gonna hide,

203
00:09:55,842 --> 00:09:58,218
and once you figure out if she's
the girl from the bar, we run like hell.

204
00:09:58,401 --> 00:10:00,257
- No.
- What do you mean, no?

205
00:10:00,893 --> 00:10:03,297
That woman, like every woman
in your Final Four,

206
00:10:03,401 --> 00:10:05,966
deserves an apology, and I'm not
telling you if she's the one

207
00:10:06,073 --> 00:10:07,767
until I hear you say, "I'm sorry."

208
00:10:08,183 --> 00:10:09,397
Are you nuts?

209
00:10:09,604 --> 00:10:12,408
That would involve me speaking to
a woman I've already had sex with,

210
00:10:12,514 --> 00:10:15,979
which, frankly, is a little bit like
changing the oil in a rental car.

211
00:10:16,332 --> 00:10:17,857
Barney, you're doing this.

212
00:10:18,061 --> 00:10:19,938
Lily, this girl hates me.

213
00:10:20,042 --> 00:10:22,878
I hooked up with her in an apartment
I was pretending was my own,

214
00:10:22,984 --> 00:10:25,446
told her I loved her,
and then ditched her there.

215
00:10:25,551 --> 00:10:29,409
She got arrested for trespassing,
bit a cop, and spent eight days in jail.

216
00:10:30,483 --> 00:10:33,706
Oh, crap, there she is!
If she sees me, she's gonna kill me!

217
00:10:33,913 --> 00:10:36,547
Here's what we're gonna do.
Hey, Meg! Over here!

218
00:10:36,751 --> 00:10:40,047
Look who it is!
Your old friend Barney!

219
00:10:45,416 --> 00:10:46,193
Barney?

220
00:10:47,246 --> 00:10:49,303
If she kills me,
I want you to go into my apartment,

221
00:10:49,406 --> 00:10:52,401
grab the metal briefcase under my bed
and throw it in the East River.

222
00:10:52,507 --> 00:10:54,001
What are you doing here?

223
00:10:54,106 --> 00:10:56,371
Look, Meg, we need to talk.

224
00:10:57,096 --> 00:10:58,392
It was all my fault.

225
00:11:00,016 --> 00:11:01,671
I know it was, baby.

226
00:11:02,015 --> 00:11:03,671
I just came on too strong.

227
00:11:04,537 --> 00:11:05,951
And I forgive you.

228
00:11:06,637 --> 00:11:07,632
I love you.

229
00:11:08,575 --> 00:11:11,590
Oh, my God!
I love you, too!

230
00:11:11,698 --> 00:11:17,180
No! What's the matter with you?
Get off of him!

231
00:11:17,548 --> 00:11:20,830
Look, she's not the one,
but you still owe her an apol...

232
00:11:28,748 --> 00:11:30,612
So you remember who
this one is, right?

233
00:11:30,817 --> 00:11:33,200
Yes. You told her you were Ted
and that you were an architect.

234
00:11:33,307 --> 00:11:36,661
Right, and if you recall, her computer
had a web cam and a T-1 line, so I...

235
00:11:36,867 --> 00:11:38,630
Yeah, I know, Barney,
you showed me.

236
00:11:38,736 --> 00:11:41,121
And that still doesn't count
as a Christmas present.

237
00:11:41,995 --> 00:11:43,710
Go over there
and apologize.

238
00:11:44,916 --> 00:11:46,562
Ah, there she is.

239
00:11:46,665 --> 00:11:49,592
Ooh, and she's holding hot coffee.
Maybe she'll throw it in your face.

240
00:11:50,227 --> 00:11:52,970
- You're really enjoying this, aren't you?
- I'm making a scrapbook.

241
00:11:57,168 --> 00:11:58,390
Anna, hi.

242
00:11:58,598 --> 00:12:01,393
Look who it is,
Mr. Big Shot Architect.

243
00:12:01,908 --> 00:12:04,700
If you're here to ask me
to take down the Web site, forget it.

244
00:12:04,808 --> 00:12:07,570
- What Web site?
- Ted-Mosby-Is-A-Jerk-dot-com.

245
00:12:09,498 --> 00:12:11,780
You're right, I do deserve that.

246
00:12:13,235 --> 00:12:14,963
That's all I came here to say.

247
00:12:15,675 --> 00:12:16,531
You know what?

248
00:12:17,318 --> 00:12:20,372
I don't care who knows about it.
Excuse me.

249
00:12:20,625 --> 00:12:23,713
Excuse me.
I, Ted Mosby,

250
00:12:23,915 --> 00:12:25,930
am a jerk to women.

251
00:12:26,508 --> 00:12:31,090
Tell your sisters.
Tell your daughters to stay away!

252
00:12:32,237 --> 00:12:34,932
Ted-Mosby-Is-A-Jerk-dot-com.

253
00:12:36,187 --> 00:12:41,811
<i>And that little Web site went on
to get 400,000 hits. Thanks, Barney.</i>

254
00:12:46,737 --> 00:12:48,652
Which one is this again?

255
00:12:49,528 --> 00:12:51,691
Larney!
Die!

256
00:12:52,875 --> 00:12:54,482
- Is it her?
- Die!

257
00:12:54,808 --> 00:12:55,571
Smile.

258
00:12:57,005 --> 00:13:00,612
<i>You look good.
Have you lost weight?</i>

259
00:13:05,366 --> 00:13:07,611
We're down to the number one seed.

260
00:13:07,905 --> 00:13:10,341
I knew it was Holly.
It had to be Holly.

261
00:13:10,708 --> 00:13:12,961
Man, I was hoping it wasn't Holly.

262
00:13:20,728 --> 00:13:22,973
Barney, did you hear that?
Somebody's stealing my truck.

263
00:13:24,908 --> 00:13:26,413
Barney?

264
00:13:28,807 --> 00:13:30,362
Barney!

265
00:13:36,787 --> 00:13:38,851
That is the worst thing
you've ever done.

266
00:13:38,956 --> 00:13:41,321
That's the worst thing
anyone has ever done.

267
00:13:41,427 --> 00:13:45,450
But in my defense,
she was kind of annoying.

268
00:13:47,588 --> 00:13:48,811
She's gonna kill you.

269
00:13:50,856 --> 00:13:52,552
- Barney.
- Holly.

270
00:13:53,898 --> 00:13:55,170
Mark, come over here.

271
00:13:57,526 --> 00:14:00,363
Barney, this is my fianc?, Mark.

272
00:14:00,735 --> 00:14:01,431
Barney?

273
00:14:02,097 --> 00:14:04,683
You're the Barney
who ditched her in the woods?

274
00:14:08,686 --> 00:14:10,543
So you're not mad at Barney?

275
00:14:10,647 --> 00:14:12,692
Don't you want an apology?

276
00:14:12,795 --> 00:14:14,783
An admission of guilt?

277
00:14:15,328 --> 00:14:16,363
Your truck back?

278
00:14:16,565 --> 00:14:18,923
No, whatever happened was in the past.

279
00:14:19,025 --> 00:14:21,491
And Mark is my present and my future.

280
00:14:21,756 --> 00:14:23,903
And if you ditching Holly
in the woods

281
00:14:24,007 --> 00:14:26,290
made her stop running around
with guys like you,

282
00:14:26,395 --> 00:14:28,022
then cheers.

283
00:14:29,575 --> 00:14:31,813
Well then, to the last
Fourth of July weekend

284
00:14:31,917 --> 00:14:33,920
I'll spend getting eaten alive
by mosquitoes.

285
00:14:35,068 --> 00:14:36,710
Fourth of July?

286
00:14:37,148 --> 00:14:38,930
We started dating in June.

287
00:14:43,798 --> 00:14:45,220
We ruined their lives.

288
00:14:45,595 --> 00:14:46,810
And the worst part of it

289
00:14:47,017 --> 00:14:49,570
is that you didn't apologize
to any of those women.

290
00:14:49,815 --> 00:14:52,650
No, the worst part is that we still
have no idea who my stalker is.

291
00:14:52,858 --> 00:14:55,330
Well, that's because
you're going about this all wrong.

292
00:14:55,436 --> 00:14:57,493
I mean, why chase someone
who's following you?

293
00:14:57,935 --> 00:15:00,132
All you need to do
is go down to the bar,

294
00:15:00,237 --> 00:15:02,461
hit on someone,
and wait until she turns up.

295
00:15:03,618 --> 00:15:04,870
That's not a bad idea.

296
00:15:05,668 --> 00:15:07,623
I'll pretend to be the girl
that you're hitting on.

297
00:15:07,998 --> 00:15:11,300
I don't know. That's a lot riding on
a girl who giggles when she lies.

298
00:15:11,405 --> 00:15:12,252
I do not.

299
00:15:12,747 --> 00:15:14,411
Have you ever fallen asleep
while eating ribs?

300
00:15:14,645 --> 00:15:15,840
No.

301
00:15:19,177 --> 00:15:20,902
Look, I can do this, okay?

302
00:15:21,005 --> 00:15:24,220
I mean, how else are you going
to find out who this girl is.

303
00:15:24,527 --> 00:15:26,103
- I'm in.
- Okay,

304
00:15:26,458 --> 00:15:28,143
here's how it's gonna work.
Now Lily,

305
00:15:28,828 --> 00:15:30,190
<i>she knows what you look like,</i>

306
00:15:30,297 --> 00:15:34,020
<i>so just hang out at the jukebox, and
don't draw any attention to yourself.</i>

307
00:15:39,025 --> 00:15:40,653
<i>And the guys will be in the booth,</i>

308
00:15:40,855 --> 00:15:43,711
<i>just pretending to have
a normal conversation.</i>

309
00:15:44,627 --> 00:15:47,850
-Talking, we should be talking.
- Words. Here are words.

310
00:15:47,955 --> 00:15:49,411
Why is this so hard?

311
00:15:51,355 --> 00:15:52,051
Laughter!

312
00:15:52,387 --> 00:15:55,963
<i>And then I'll come in,
looking hot as all hell.</i>

313
00:16:00,196 --> 00:16:03,023
Wow, you are gorgeous.

314
00:16:03,587 --> 00:16:05,432
- God, I know that's awful. I....
- Shh, go away.

315
00:16:07,316 --> 00:16:08,312
But come back later.

316
00:16:11,267 --> 00:16:13,901
<i>And then Barney will make his move.</i>

317
00:16:14,106 --> 00:16:16,112
Hey, there,
how are you doing?

318
00:16:16,586 --> 00:16:20,731
Fine, Barney.
I mean, um, fine, stranger.

319
00:16:22,217 --> 00:16:24,281
Wow, you really are awful
at this, aren't you?

320
00:16:25,948 --> 00:16:27,313
Get your hand off my thigh, Barney.

321
00:16:27,448 --> 00:16:29,992
It's supposed to look like
we're about to hook up, Robin.

322
00:16:30,655 --> 00:16:32,290
You know I'm curious.

323
00:16:32,536 --> 00:16:34,712
What do you say to these girls
to get them to come home with you?

324
00:16:35,895 --> 00:16:39,251
Usually I just lean in and whisper
this one thing in their ear.

325
00:16:48,877 --> 00:16:50,920
You're a little turned on
right now, aren't you?

326
00:16:51,078 --> 00:16:52,141
No.

327
00:16:55,775 --> 00:16:57,841
Look, somebody's watching us.
Make your move to the bathroom.

328
00:16:57,946 --> 00:17:00,110
I'm going to go to the bathroom now,

329
00:17:00,217 --> 00:17:04,202
but, uh, when I come back
we'll go to my place and have sex.

330
00:17:08,377 --> 00:17:11,490
Dude, dude, dude, look. Blonde girl
heading over to Robin right now.

331
00:17:11,695 --> 00:17:12,683
We are go.

332
00:17:12,788 --> 00:17:16,540
I don't know what to do with my hands.
What do I normally do with my hands?

333
00:17:21,447 --> 00:17:24,880
I brought a copy of the bracket.
Which one is she?

334
00:17:26,797 --> 00:17:30,013
I don't recognize her.
She's not on the Top 64.

335
00:17:30,217 --> 00:17:31,750
Not even on the bracket.

336
00:17:31,855 --> 00:17:35,023
Wow, Cinderella Story comes out
of nowhere to win the whole thing.

337
00:17:35,127 --> 00:17:36,651
That'll warm your heart.

338
00:17:36,757 --> 00:17:37,832
Are you okay?

339
00:17:38,987 --> 00:17:40,772
I don't even recognize her.

340
00:17:44,785 --> 00:17:46,512
I don't remember you.

341
00:17:47,018 --> 00:17:49,351
I've spent the last two days
trying to remember

342
00:17:49,458 --> 00:17:51,701
every girl that I've slept with
and all the horrible things

343
00:17:51,807 --> 00:17:52,951
that I have done to them.

344
00:17:53,055 --> 00:17:56,332
And I have done some
horrible things. I mean,

345
00:17:56,596 --> 00:17:58,961
at one point, I'm pretty sure
I sold a woman.

346
00:18:00,265 --> 00:18:02,241
I didn't speak the language, but,

347
00:18:02,348 --> 00:18:03,782
I shook a guy's hand,

348
00:18:03,885 --> 00:18:05,970
he gave me the keys to a Mercedes,
and I left her there.

349
00:18:07,915 --> 00:18:10,013
I'm the guy who keeps a scrapbook

350
00:18:10,118 --> 00:18:11,951
of all of the women
I have slept with,

351
00:18:12,058 --> 00:18:14,632
but I never thought I was the guy
who would sleep with a girl

352
00:18:14,736 --> 00:18:16,401
and not even remember her.

353
00:18:16,505 --> 00:18:19,443
So from the bottom of my heart,
for whatever I did to you,

354
00:18:19,548 --> 00:18:21,042
I apologize.

355
00:18:21,395 --> 00:18:26,360
Oh, Barney!
Oh, I'm so proud of you.

356
00:18:26,748 --> 00:18:27,860
That's not her.

357
00:18:28,578 --> 00:18:30,173
- I'm so sorry.
- What? What?

358
00:18:30,277 --> 00:18:32,561
Barney, I'm sorry,
that's my friend Sally from work.

359
00:18:32,668 --> 00:18:34,010
We just ran into each other.

360
00:18:34,725 --> 00:18:36,370
So I apologized for nothing?

361
00:18:36,476 --> 00:18:38,720
Yes, but it was a great apology.

362
00:18:38,825 --> 00:18:41,291
And a perfect way to end my scrapbook.

363
00:18:41,398 --> 00:18:44,822
I'm going to call this photo
"Barney's Redemption."

364
00:18:46,276 --> 00:18:48,612
Could you stop giving me the finger?

365
00:18:49,678 --> 00:18:54,401
<i>One shining moment
You reached for the sky</i>

366
00:18:54,587 --> 00:18:59,162
<i>One shining moment you knew</i>

367
00:18:59,265 --> 00:19:04,323
<i>One shining moment
You were willing to try</i>

368
00:19:04,506 --> 00:19:07,283
<i>One shining moment</i>

369
00:19:07,386 --> 00:19:10,763
<i>Eventually, Barney did figure out
who the mysterious girl was.</i>

370
00:19:10,868 --> 00:19:12,630
<i>But more on that later.</i>

371
00:19:25,024 --> 00:19:28,298
<i>Sometimes we search for one thing but
discover another.</i>

372
00:19:28,404 --> 00:19:31,548
<i>Even through I didn't find</i>

373
00:19:31,653 --> 00:19:35,287
<i>the mystery girl...</i>

374
00:19:40,413 --> 00:19:43,390
<i>I did find out something</i>

375
00:19:43,492 --> 00:19:46,907
<i>very important about myself...</i>

376
00:19:47,012 --> 00:19:49,930
Barney, come back to bed.

377
00:19:50,033 --> 00:19:52,390
You have a shuttle launch tomorrow.

378
00:19:52,702 --> 00:19:55,598
And that asteroid
that's headed for Manhattan,

379
00:19:55,703 --> 00:19:57,858
it's not going to destroy itself.

380
00:20:01,834 --> 00:20:03,447
<i>I'm awesome.</i>
