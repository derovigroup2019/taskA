00:01:41,370 --> 00:01:42,280
Day by myself.

50
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:44,020
I don't need you people.

51
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:45,940
You make me physically ill!

52
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:49,040
He did look a little green.

53
00:01:54,260 --> 00:01:55,490
Hello?

54
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:57,530
Hey. happy st. patty's day.

55
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,090
How are you? I've been talking to you forever

56
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:02,090
-Who is it? -it's ted's butt.

57
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:06,720
Damn it!My phone keeps pocket dialing. 

58
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:08,020
That's like 8th times today.

59
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:09,320
In fairness I did call

60
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:11,400
Ted's butt about 2:00 this afternoon.

61
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:14,230
Just long enough to call you back.

62
00:02:16,930 --> 00:02:17,650
Barney?

63
00:02:17,650 --> 00:02:18,320
Where are you.

64
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:21,270
In a cab, heading downtown with our hot and

65
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:22,670
Sexy dates for the evening.

66
00:02:22,670 --> 00:02:25,350
Yes, it happens that fast!

67
00:02:25,940 --> 00:02:28,610
You're coming with us.

68
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:30,000
For the last time.

69
00:02:30,010 --> 00:02:31,090
All right,

70
00:02:31,090 --> 00:02:31,980
I didn't want to tell you this

71
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:32,860
in front of marshall and Lilly

72
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:35,230
They are old and married and it's too late for them anyway

73
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:37,510
but ted, the world is

74
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:39,480
Going to come to an end tonight.

75
00:02:40,790 --> 00:02:41,950
Yes, think about it.

76
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:45,090
End of the world, Nostradamus?¬notre dame,

77
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:46,290
Fighting irish.

78
00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:48,450
Irish, st. patrick's day.

79
00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:49,490
This is it, bro.

80
00:02:49,490 --> 00:02:50,750
bro

81
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:51,620
Apocalypse now.

82
00:02:52,610 --> 00:02:53,840
bro?megandon

83
00:02:54,850 --> 00:02:56,840
You are young, you're single.

84
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:57,540
You will have so much more

85
00:02:57,540 --> 00:02:58,180
Fun with me.

86
00:02:58,180 --> 00:02:59,360
Do you want to spend your

87
00:02:59,370 --> 00:03:01,200
Last night on earth playing

88
00:03:01,490 --> 00:03:03,120
Board games with marshall and lilly?

89
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:07,360
My hands smell weird.

90
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:08,110
Smell this.

91
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:11,320
They do, that's new.

92
00:03:11,810 --> 00:03:13,030
I'll be there in five minutes.

93
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:16,740
Yes all right!

94
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:17,480
He's in.

95
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:18,680
Ted is a great guy.

96
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:23,360
You're going to love him.

97
00:03:25,450 --> 00:03:28,670
So on march 17 2008, I went

98
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:30,240
To a big st. patrick's day party.

99
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:32,470
And it's a good thing I did

100
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:33,700
Because funny story,

101
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:36,740
Your mother was there.

102
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:43,040

103
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:47,340

104
00:03:53,490 --> 00:03:55,000
Hi,have you med ted.

105
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,110
Hi, I'm mary.

106
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:57,910
Hi, happy st. patty's day.

107
00:03:58,070 --> 00:03:59,270
I haven't met ted either.

108
00:03:59,270 --> 00:04:00,500
-I'm stefanie. -Hi

109
00:04:01,270 --> 00:04:04,360
Dude, back off. I called this on stefanie.

110
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:06,700
Okay, mary's hot .

111
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:08,370
Well then I want mary.

112
00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:09,950
Fine.

113
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:13,570
Oh, I see reverse psychology.

114
00:04:13,570 --> 00:04:14,780
Then I'm sticking with

115
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:18,180
-Stefanie dr. frid. -Ok

116
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:19,290
Which one do you want more.

117
00:04:19,290 --> 00:04:19,790
Either one.

118
00:04:19,790 --> 00:04:20,560
I want them both.

119
00:04:20,570 --> 00:04:21,380
You're an idiot.

120
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:23,190
It may be a moot point.

121
00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:25,960
It doesn't look like we're getting in.

122
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:26,760
Look at this.

123
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:27,550
You know why there's a line,

124
00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:29,160
it's  because i ditched marshall and lilly

125
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,300
And now the universe is

126
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:32,310
Punishing us for it, that's why.

127
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:40,360
What's it going to cost us

128
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:41,580
To get in, $20?

129
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:43,080
$40.

130
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:45,230
Dude come on, you're making the we folk look bad.

131
00:04:45,230 --> 00:04:47,530
just give me your pot of gold.

132
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:48,690
Is it just you two?

133
00:04:48,690 --> 00:04:51,070
Don't worry we're not gonna blow your race here.

134
00:04:51,070 --> 00:04:52,290
We happen to have two very hot girls with us.

135
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:54,010
Mine is the hotter one.

136
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,450
Sorry guys, if it was

137
00:04:56,450 --> 00:04:57,390
Just you two, you can go in

138
00:04:57,390 --> 00:04:58,320
Right now.

139
00:04:58,320 --> 00:04:59,640
We have nothing but girls in there.

140
00:04:59,990 --> 00:05:01,690
People will start thinking it's a lesbian bar

141
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:05,860
Would you excuse us for just a minute?

142
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:09,490
Ted I'm going to be honest

143
00:05:09,490 --> 00:05:11,250
I was full of it with

144
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:12,240
that Nostradamus thing

145
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:14,180
but I'm starting to think there's

146
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:16,480
Serious planetary crap going on here tonight.

147
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:19,320
Never in the history of new

148
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:20,560
York city nightclub has

149
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,810
There been a shortage of dudes.

150
00:05:22,810 --> 00:05:23,840
Not even during the great

151
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:25,760
Dude shortage of 1883.

152
00:05:26,730 --> 00:05:27,700
We've got to ditch these girls.

153
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:29,250
You dragged them all

154
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:30,100
The way down here.

155
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:31,830
I don't see no ring on this finger.

156
00:05:33,290 --> 00:05:33,960
Hold on.

157
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:35,750
Excuse me.

158
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:36,340
Are the girls in there

159
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:37,660
Hotter than our dates?

160
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,040
I don't know if they're hotter

161
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:41,520
But they're drunker.

162
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:42,270
Rock and roll.

163
00:05:46,690 --> 00:05:50,280
Welcome to your new dream home my lady.

164
00:05:51,430 --> 00:05:52,450
All right, all right.

165
00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:54,550
Put me down, robin thinks we're weird.

166
00:05:54,550 --> 00:05:56,050
No it's fine,

167
00:05:56,050 --> 00:06:00,290
it was only weird on the subway.

168
00:06:00,290 --> 00:06:01,910
I'm going to check the other rooms to see if

169
00:06:01,910 --> 00:06:05,110
The previous owners left us any free stuff.

170
00:06:05,110 --> 00:06:06,450
I'll hang our first piece of art,

171
00:06:07,490 --> 00:06:09,030
There's already a nail, 

172
00:06:09,030 --> 00:06:10,070
hey lily, free nail!

173
00:06:10,170 --> 00:06:11,760
score!

174
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:16,280
-How's that. -perfect.

175
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:29,300
Now this is ridiculous

176
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:30,320
Is it the nail?

177
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:33,000
-Marshall  -Is the wall cookt crooked or something?

178
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:35,960
-Marshall  -Is there a draft in here.

179
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:37,060
Marshall,

180
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:37,840
what?

181
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:39,240
Your apartment is crooked.

182
00:06:40,270 --> 00:06:40,980
What do you mean?

183
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:46,880
It was the kind of thing

184
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:49,870
You didn't notice Until you noticed it.

185
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:51,670
and once you noticed it, you couldn't not notice it.

186
00:06:51,810 --> 00:06:52,910
Lilly an marshall's new apartment

187
00:06:52,910 --> 00:06:54,920
Was crooked.

188
00:06:57,950 --> 00:06:58,750
Oh, no!

189
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:00,700
No, no!

190
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:02,100
Oh,no, no!no, no!

191
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:03,570
Yes.

192
00:07:03,570 --> 00:07:04,260
Are you telling me that

193
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:05,250
We just spend our entire

194
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:08,280
Life saving on a crooked apartment?

195
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:10,090
Oh my god 

196
00:07:10,090 --> 00:07:11,810
Oh,she's gonna fret

197
00:07:12,210 --> 00:07:12,790
Look what I found in the

198
00:07:12,790 --> 00:07:15,080
Kids' room, free skateboard,

199
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:16,080
Score one

200
00:07:16,290 --> 00:07:17,760
Free hungry, hungry hippo.

201
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:19,640
Double score!

202
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:20,440
I'm going to check the kitchen

203
00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:22,280
How can she not notice.

204
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:24,780
It's like the last 20 minutes of titanic in here.

205
00:07:25,410 --> 00:07:26,860
We have keep this quiet,

206
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:30,000
If lilly finds out her dream house crooked

207
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:30,760
It will break her heart.

208
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:32,730
Free salad Strainer.

209
00:07:32,730 --> 00:07:35,600
I love this place

210
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:37,140
Just for tonight, okay?

211
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:38,140
Ok

212
00:07:39,230 --> 00:07:40,780
It's going to be an uphill battle.

213
00:07:42,270 --> 00:07:43,690
I'm just saying we have to

214
00:07:43,690 --> 00:07:45,290
Think of the right angle.

215
00:07:47,210 --> 00:07:47,950
I have a third one but I'm

216
00:07:47,950 --> 00:07:48,800
Not going to say it.

217
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:52,590
I think we've stumbled

218
00:07:52,590 --> 00:07:55,430
Into some sort of ethical Worm hole.

219
00:07:55,430 --> 00:07:56,530
-Green suit -yeah

220
00:07:56,530 --> 00:07:57,490
I ditched marshall and lilly

221
00:07:57,490 --> 00:07:59,930
And was rewarded with two beautiful girls.

222
00:07:59,930 --> 00:08:00,920
Suits made of green.

223
00:08:00,930 --> 00:08:03,340
We bailed on those two beautiful girls 

224
00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:04,410
and now we're

225
00:08:04,410 --> 00:08:06,410
Being rewarded with a sea of Beautiful girls.

226
00:08:06,410 --> 00:08:07,360
38 long.

227
00:08:09,010 --> 00:08:09,620
Like the laws of the

228
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:11,310
Universe are working in reverse.

229
00:08:11,310 --> 00:08:12,390
Can you put it on my tab.

230
00:08:12,390 --> 00:08:13,280
What's the last name.

231
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:14,230
Guido.

232
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:17,920
I'm going to try something to see if this works

233
00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:20,070
-hey  -hey what kind of do you get?

234
00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:22,200
A bottle of dom perignon.Can you put it on my tab.

235
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:22,910
What's your name.

236
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:25,610

00:08:29,170 --> 00:08:30,580
Now we wait and see something good

239
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:31,680
Oh,hello

240
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,040
St. patrick's tradition

241
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:34,630
If you're not wearing green,

242
00:08:34,630 --> 00:08:35,910
You have to get punished.

243
00:08:35,930 --> 00:08:37,610
well this is what i deserved

244
00:08:37,710 --> 00:08:38,940
I'm not wearing green either.

245
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:42,830
This is deep teal the

246
00:08:42,830 --> 00:08:44,140
Lighting makes it.

247
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:45,240
I'm Ted

248
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:47,780

You guys can join me and friends.We have a bottle of Tequila

251
00:08:53,310 --> 00:08:55,820

Okay, it's official, do

253
00:08:58,480 --> 00:08:59,920
Bad things, good things happen.

254
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:04,280
Ted, listen, are you hearing that?

255
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:05,310
That's the universe.

256
00:09:05,310 --> 00:09:07,080
The universe is talking to us.

257
00:09:07,590 --> 00:09:09,770
We don't have to build a baseball field, do we?

258
00:09:10,060 --> 00:09:11,600
No the universe is

259
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:14,790
Telling us that we have a free pass tonight.

260
00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:16,360
The universe is saying that

261
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:17,900
We don't have to live in

262
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:19,860
Fear of the -- are you still there?

263
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:20,810
Yeah, I'm still here.

264
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:23,690
For the repercussions of our actions.

265
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:26,060
There is no waiting for tomorrow 

266
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:28,130
because do you know why ted?

267
00:09:30,330 --> 00:09:32,990
There is no tomorrow.

268
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:35,200
No tomorrow, huh?

269
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:36,890
By the way mr. garido,

270
00:09:37,290 --> 00:09:38,560
With your champagne you get

271
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:40,270
A free complimentary caviar.

272
00:09:40,970 --> 00:09:41,890
Enjoy.

273
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:47,290
Not tomorrow

274
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:49,290
Not tomorrow

275
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:50,290
Hey wonder what the

276
00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:51,510
Grown-ups are doing right now?

277
00:09:57,230 --> 00:09:58,250
I win again!

278
00:09:59,010 --> 00:10:00,240
Why do I keep winning?

279
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:02,440
Maybe your hip spoe just

280
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:04,370
Hungrier than ours.

281
00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:07,230
That's it.That's what is.It's not gravity 

282
00:10:07,230 --> 00:10:08,390
that's for sure. I'll tell you that.

283
00:10:10,850 --> 00:10:11,750
What's that?

284
00:10:17,050 --> 00:10:18,030
What's going on here?

285
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:21,630
Okay, lilly.

286
00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:23,720
While you were in the other

287
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:26,290
Room, robin and I 

288
00:10:26,290 --> 00:10:28,670
We discovered something about this apartment

289
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:29,360
It's not a big deal.

290
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:31,100
It's not like a disaster,

291
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:32,680
It's just something that

292
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:34,530
We're going to have to learn to live with.

293
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:40,960
Robin and I saw a ghost.

294
00:10:41,630 --> 00:10:42,500
What?

295
00:10:43,370 --> 00:10:44,480
He's kidding, right?

296
00:10:44,950 --> 00:10:46,950
No, we really saw a ghost.

297
00:10:47,690 --> 00:10:48,640
What did it look like?

298
00:10:49,790 --> 00:10:52,820
A sheet with two holes

299
00:10:53,870 --> 00:10:55,800
He was a Confederate general

300
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:56,910
Who was wounded at the battle of Antietam 

301
00:10:56,910 --> 00:10:58,650
and died at the army

302
00:10:58,650 --> 00:11:02,330
Hospital which once stood on this very spot

303
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:03,620
And now he wanders these halls 

304
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:08,020
vowing revenge against the union he once failed in

305
00:11:08,930 --> 00:11:10,710
But he seems nice. good guy.

306
00:11:12,350 --> 00:11:13,630
You see ghosts everywhere.

307
00:11:13,630 --> 00:11:15,540
You see ghosts at starbucks.

308
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:18,260
That kenny g holiday cd

309
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:20,170
Just flew off the shelf.

310
00:11:20,170 --> 00:11:21,210
Last time that happened.

311
00:11:22,550 --> 00:11:24,440
Robin you're a skeptic so if

312
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:27,340
You say you saw a ghost,.

313
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:29,740
It passed right

314
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:31,370
Through me and suddenly i

315
00:11:31,370 --> 00:11:32,760
Felt cold.

316
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:34,320
So very coal. cold.

317
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:40,560
You know ashley, you

318
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:41,400
Probably just want to get up

319
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:42,730
And walk away but I just

320
00:11:42,730 --> 00:11:43,590
Have to test out this theory

321
00:11:43,590 --> 00:11:44,620
I've been working on.

322
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:47,720
Tonight, I'm not looking for

323
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:48,570
A relationship.

324
00:11:48,570 --> 00:11:50,440
I really just want to hook

325
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:51,250
Up with you, leave before

326
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:52,700
Breakfast and never see you again.

327
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:56,510
I'm in.

328
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:58,330
Unbelievable.

329
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:02,330
Hot damn, that's a deep naval!

330
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:04,480
No tomorrow ted!

331
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:05,810
No tomorrow barney.

332
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:08,370
No tomorrow, huh?

333
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:10,530
I like that idea.

334
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:12,640
Because if there is a tomorrow,

335
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:14,530
I'm going to be in

336
00:12:14,530 --> 00:12:16,210
A lot of trouble.

337
00:12:17,030 --> 00:12:17,840
Why is that?

338
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:19,380
I'm married.

339
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,230
Tell me you're messing

340
00:12:24,230 --> 00:12:25,000
With me guys.

341
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,200
You didn't actually see a ghost 

342
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:28,620
it's not a big deal baby.

343
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:29,650
He seemed friendly.

344
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:31,770
You said he's a Confederate general, 

345
00:12:31,870 --> 00:12:32,960
they're the bad guys.

346
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:34,700
And he's probably racist!

347
00:12:35,670 --> 00:12:36,890
He seems polite.

348
00:12:36,890 --> 00:12:39,220
He has courtly southern manners.

349
00:12:40,070 --> 00:12:41,670
How can we bring our kids here.

350
00:12:41,670 --> 00:12:45,780
I don't want a confederate general ghost teach them  racism!

351
00:12:45,790 --> 00:12:48,950
He loves people of all colors and creeds.

352
00:12:48,950 --> 00:12:51,020
He was fighting for state rights.That's all.

353
00:12:51,460 --> 00:12:52,070
You have said he was wearing a sheet,

354
00:12:52,070 --> 00:12:54,220
what do you think that means?

355
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:55,910
The apartment is crooked!

356
00:12:57,450 --> 00:12:58,260
What?

357
00:13:00,610 --> 00:13:01,170
Robin and i

358
00:13:01,670 --> 00:13:02,980
Didn't see a ghost.

359
00:13:06,330 --> 00:13:08,150
The floor is crooked, isn't it?

360
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:10,280
Yeah.

361
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:12,190
We spent our entire

362
00:13:12,190 --> 00:13:14,680
Life savings on this particular.

363
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:17,140
The next 30 mortgage paying

364
00:13:17,140 --> 00:13:18,520
Years of our lives will be

365
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:21,600
Spent on a floor an it's crooked!

366
00:13:28,890 --> 00:13:30,930
Thanks a lot, robin.

367
00:13:32,910 --> 00:13:34,070
How is racist

368
00:13:34,070 --> 00:13:36,070
Ghost bear than crooked?

369
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:39,440
Someone tell me how that's better.

370
00:13:42,430 --> 00:13:43,730
Oh, I'm sorry.

371
00:13:43,730 --> 00:13:45,460
That's okay.

372
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:49,130
So I'm having second thoughts about that theory.

373
00:13:49,130 --> 00:13:50,800
I'm telling you if you want to know how old a woman

374
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,030
Is check her elbows.

375
00:13:52,030 --> 00:13:53,200
Not that theory.

376
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,830
You have to be More specific,ted

377
00:13:54,830 --> 00:13:56,830
Because I have so many theories.

378
00:13:56,830 --> 00:13:58,260
The whole do bad,good things happen.

379
00:13:58,260 --> 00:14:00,500
Asheley is married.

380
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:01,330
So?

381
00:14:01,330 --> 00:14:02,700
What do you mean so?

382
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:05,030
Open your brain tank,

383
00:14:05,030 --> 00:14:09,400
Because here come fromPremium 91 octane knowledge.

384
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:10,800
There's three rules of cheating.

385
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:12,800
It's not cheating if you're not the one whose married.

386
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:16,330
It's not cheating if her name has two adjacent vowels

387
00:14:16,340 --> 00:14:18,580
And it's not cheating if she's in a different area code.

388
00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:20,070
You're fine on all three counts.

389
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:21,950
How do you know she's from a different area code.

390
00:14:21,950 --> 00:14:24,010
She's 516

391
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:27,230
She may dress like 718,she might act like 212

392
00:14:27,330 --> 00:14:29,930
But trust me,she is 516

393
00:14:30,020 --> 00:14:30,700
Oh and her husband

394
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:33,990
Letting her out alone on st.Patty's day 

395
00:14:34,090 --> 00:14:36,530
if that guy is not 973, I'm 307.

396
00:14:38,230 --> 00:14:39,230
Wyoming.

397
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,720
Maybe we can nail down all our furniture.

398
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:48,880
We won't be able to get a pinball machine.

399
00:14:48,910 --> 00:14:51,790
Unless we put a book under two of the legs or something.

400
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:54,230
But if we wanna read those books.this is a nightmare.

401
00:14:55,130 --> 00:14:56,710
Can't raise our kids here.

402
00:14:56,780 --> 00:14:58,120
They will grow up slanted.

403
00:14:58,120 --> 00:14:59,660
If we have a daughter,

404
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:01,910
we have to call her ilene.

405
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,510
I don't think we can live here marshall.

406
00:15:06,350 --> 00:15:07,210
I don't know what we're gonna to do.

407
00:15:08,130 --> 00:15:09,230
Marshall?

408
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:11,520
Open the door.

409
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:23,420
If I make to it the door

410
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:24,820
That's five points.

411
00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:27,810
Woo-hoo!

412
00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:30,180
Yeah!

413
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:32,890
Five points.

414
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:35,090
10 bucks says I can do it backwards.

415
00:15:35,090 --> 00:15:36,600
So lilly and marshall

416
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:39,620
Decided to make the best of A bad situation

417
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:43,790
and that's also how the apartment roller luge was invented.

418
00:15:43,790 --> 00:15:46,050
Very careful,very,oh, yeah!

419
00:15:46,950 --> 00:15:48,120
So she's married.

420
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:48,950
Not like she has kid.

421
00:15:49,210 --> 00:15:50,930
How do you know?

422
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:53,190
Wrist!It's like you don't even listen to me.

423
00:15:55,690 --> 00:15:56,630
Oh, hey.

424
00:15:56,630 --> 00:15:57,320
Hey.

425
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:57,950
Where did you go.

426
00:15:58,770 --> 00:15:59,700
Well, I just.

427
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:00,450
Was it something I said.

428
00:16:00,450 --> 00:16:02,350
No,no,no,it's just...

429
00:16:02,350 --> 00:16:03,770
Well, you're married and

430
00:16:03,770 --> 00:16:06,490
We've been drinking and i was worried we might...

431
00:16:07,190 --> 00:16:09,610
This is a very bad idea.

432
00:16:12,010 --> 00:16:13,310
We have a problem

433
00:16:13,310 --> 00:16:15,030
Hey, hey, hey.

434
00:16:16,950 --> 00:16:18,780
Is this your husband.

435
00:16:18,780 --> 00:16:20,600
I've never seen him in my life

436
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:22,700
Ok,what's our problem

437
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:24,290
Rick,Rick garido

438
00:16:24,290 --> 00:16:25,730
According to the bar tenor

439
00:16:25,730 --> 00:16:26,980
I'm the guy who has been

440
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:28,790
Buying you shall pain all night

441
00:16:29,090 --> 00:16:31,530
Ok,there's a very simple explanation

442
00:16:33,230 --> 00:16:34,590
The next thing I know is the police show up,

443
00:16:34,590 --> 00:16:35,530
They arrest the other guy

444
00:16:35,530 --> 00:16:37,870
and I'm drinking for free the rest of the night

445
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:39,290
It was awesome

446
00:16:41,290 --> 00:16:42,380
Awesome?

447
00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:43,660
Yeah

448
00:16:43,660 --> 00:16:46,980
You don't see anything wrong with that story

449
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:49,920
Well I lost my phone in the club somewhere

450
00:16:49,990 --> 00:16:50,990
What the hell is wrong with you,dude?

451
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:53,770
I lose things

452
00:16:53,770 --> 00:16:56,190
You kissed a married woman ted

453
00:16:56,190 --> 00:16:58,680
You committed credit card fraud

454
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:00,100
You kissed a married woman

455
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:02,790
Do you know how offensive that is to me?

456
00:17:03,190 --> 00:17:04,370
You're turning into barney

457
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:05,690
We don't need another barney

458
00:17:08,590 --> 00:17:10,650
It's st. patty's day!

459
00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:12,850
It wasn't as bad as it sounds

460
00:17:12,850 --> 00:17:13,910
It wasn't as bad as it sounds?

461
00:17:14,430 --> 00:17:15,420
Huh? okay.

462
00:17:15,420 --> 00:17:16,790

First skipped message

00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,740
I don't see no ring on this finger

466
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:23,870
And then last night

467
00:17:23,870 --> 00:17:25,260
Started coming back to me

468
00:17:25,990 --> 00:17:26,580
The real version

469
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:29,830
Are the girls this there hotter than our dates?

470
00:17:29,830 --> 00:17:31,500
I don't know if they're hotter,

471
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:34,040
but they're drunker.

472
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:35,240

00:17:49,540 --> 00:17:50,560
Sir, what's the last name?

479
00:17:51,210 --> 00:17:51,890
Garido.

480
00:17:52,790 --> 00:17:55,500
And then someone opens your eyes a bit

481
00:17:56,070 --> 00:17:57,700
And then you realize

482
00:17:57,700 --> 00:17:58,440
Next message

483
00:17:58,440 --> 00:17:59,340

00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:00,500
Leave before breakfast an

485
00:18:01,490 --> 00:18:03,040
Never see you again

486
00:18:03,980 --> 00:18:05,000
Your whole world is off balance

487
00:18:05,490 --> 00:18:06,470
Next message

489
00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:12,570
Ok,look,bro,there's a very simple explanation

490
00:18:12,580 --> 00:18:13,510
Crooked

491
00:18:19,610 --> 00:18:21,490
That was hard to listen to

492
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:23,730
No one sounds good in answerign machine

493
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:28,850
Thanks for doing that

494
00:18:32,140 --> 00:18:33,140
You yelled at me

495
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:34,870
You got very firm with me

496
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:36,320
Very confident

497
00:18:36,940 --> 00:18:37,900
It was cool

498
00:18:38,330 --> 00:18:39,080
Thanks

499
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:41,130
You're very sexy when you yell marshall

500
00:18:41,150 --> 00:18:42,840
Shut up

501
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:44,390
Crazy muscles in your neck

502
00:18:45,050 --> 00:18:47,130
You're like the kentucky derby,winning streaks

503
00:18:47,130 --> 00:18:48,330
You're ruining our last moment

504
00:18:48,330 --> 00:18:50,680
At one point I thought we were going to kiss

505
00:18:50,970 --> 00:18:51,860
Ted seriously

506
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:54,730
I'm married

507
00:18:57,030 --> 00:18:58,330
A slanted floor

508
00:18:58,330 --> 00:18:59,390
Architecturally speaking

509
00:18:59,390 --> 00:19:00,290
Fixing that will be

510
00:19:00,290 --> 00:19:01,190
Very very

511
00:19:01,190 --> 00:19:02,890
Very expensive

512
00:19:02,890 --> 00:19:06,490
And it's going to take some time too

513
00:19:06,490 --> 00:19:07,660
So, looks like you're stuck with us for a

514
00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:08,460
Little while longer if

515
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:09,490
That's okay

516
00:19:09,490 --> 00:19:10,330
Are you kidding?

517
00:19:10,330 --> 00:19:11,360
I love it

518
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:14,010
I don't know what's going to happen without you guys around

519
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:15,630
Where are you going

520
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:18,400
I'm going to get my stupid phone

521
00:19:19,060 --> 00:19:21,740
So that was st. patrick's day 2008

522
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:24,590
I find out years later that your mom was at that party

523
00:19:24,890 --> 00:19:26,230
I just didn't meet her

524
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:28,340
It's a good thing I didn't

525
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:29,750
Because if I had, I don't

526
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:31,570
Think she would have liked me

527
00:19:31,820 --> 00:19:33,580
In fact I don't think I like me

528
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,090
But that's okay

529
00:19:35,170 --> 00:19:37,520
Tomorrow had arrived

530
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:16,190
You see I didn't know it yet,

531
00:20:16,190 --> 00:20:18,390
But my luck was about to change

532
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:43,490
I'm awesome!
