1
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:03,460
Well, kids, here we are.

2
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:04,000
<font color="#ffff00" size=14>www.tvsubtitles.net</font>

3
00:00:03,530 --> 00:00:04,800
We've arrived

4
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:06,130
My 30th birthday.

5
00:00:06,130 --> 00:00:08,130
The long-awaited story of...

6
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:10,560
...the goat.

7
00:00:11,030 --> 00:00:12,960
That week started just like any other.

8
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:15,730
Barney woke up in some girl's bed.

9
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:21,500
In my experience, the way this normally goes is,

10
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:23,530
We lie here for a while,

11
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:26,660
Make a little awkward chitchat.

12
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:29,060
Check.

13
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:32,400
Then I make up some cabinet meeting, heart surgery,

14
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:33,600
Rocket test flight I've got to be at,

15
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,400
Slip out of the apartment and never call you again.

16
00:00:36,460 --> 00:00:38,230
And later at the bar,

17
00:00:38,230 --> 00:00:39,530
You tell your good friend robin

18
00:00:39,530 --> 00:00:40,960
The story of your latest conquest,

19
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:42,900
And she thinks to herself,

20
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:46,030
"who is this sad,  self-loathing idiot

21
00:00:46,030 --> 00:00:48,430
Who climbed into bed with barney stinson?"

22
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:52,460
Actually, you usually say that out loud.

23
00:00:55,830 --> 00:00:57,600
So...

24
00:00:58,130 --> 00:01:02,400
...i just slept with my best friend's ex-girlfriend

25
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:03,260
And I just slept

26
00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:06,330
With my ex-boyfriend's really good friend.

27
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:07,400
Best friend.

28
00:01:09,860 --> 00:01:11,930
Okay, here's the deal, barney.

29
00:01:11,930 --> 00:01:13,730
The second my feet touch the ground,

30
00:01:13,730 --> 00:01:15,600
This never happened.

31
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:17,100
Okay.

32
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:18,260
Wait.

33
00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:20,230
Right click, save as...

34
00:01:20,230 --> 00:01:23,160
Into the .bpeg folder, and okay.

35
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,660
This never happened.

36
00:01:26,530 --> 00:01:28,300
It's a good plan.

37
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:32,260
Now we go back to exactly the way things were before.

38
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:32,830
Okay.

39
00:01:32,830 --> 00:01:33,530
Okay.

40
00:01:33,530 --> 00:01:34,760
Right.

41
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:36,700
So, robin?

42
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:38,130
Yes, barney?

43
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:42,030
Guess who nailed the chick from metro news one last night?

44
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:03,500
Okay, uh, I am gonna take a shower,

45
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:05,830
Till june, and, um,

46
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:07,260
Since you were never here to begin with,

47
00:02:07,330 --> 00:02:08,130
You won't be here when I get out.

48
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:10,330
-Okay. -okay.

49
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:11,860
This never happened.

50
00:02:14,530 --> 00:02:16,730
Never happened.

51
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,630
Never... happened.

52
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:20,030
But pretending it never happened

53
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:21,300
Wouldn't be that easy.

54
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,730
So, tell us,

55
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:23,700
What was it like?

56
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:24,800
What?

57
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:26,060
penetrating that barrier.

58
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:27,730
You and I are the first ones to hit it.

59
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:28,860
Well, not the first ones,

60
00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:30,700
Certainly, but the first ones at this table.

61
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:33,200
I... I...

62
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:35,800
I'm... I'm...

63
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:38,460
Although, I'm gonna be hitting it pretty soon.

64
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:39,100
yeah, you are.

65
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:42,130
Yeah, and when I hit it, I'm going to go nuts.

66
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:45,730
It's gonna be all night, and I think I want a clown there.

67
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:48,500
I'm a little bit scared of clowns, but for you, I'm there.

68
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:51,000
What are you taking about?!

69
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:52,100
The big three-oh.

70
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:53,930
You know,My 30th birthday's this friday.

71
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:54,860
Did you forget?

72
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:57,100
What kind of friend is this guy?

73
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:58,560
Ha-ha right.

74
00:02:58,630 --> 00:03:00,500
A great friend, by the way.

75
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,000
The best.

76
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:03,230
Is it my imagination,

77
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:04,660
Or are these drinks getting smaller?

78
00:03:04,730 --> 00:03:07,960
If this were a doctor's office, they'd say, "try again."

79
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:11,430
How you doing there, robin?

80
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:13,700
-I'm good. -Oh, so, I made a a decision.

81
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,400
I'm going to go through all my old stuff,

82
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:18,000
And I'm getting rid of anything I have no use for anymore.

83
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:19,230
Hmm.  barney, you want my xbox?

84
00:03:20,330 --> 00:03:22,030
Ted, she has a name!

85
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:24,500
And just what are you accusing me of?

86
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:26,600
Liking video games?

87
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:27,600
I'm gonna get a drink.

88
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:29,130
I'll come with you.

89
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,030
Okay.

90
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:31,330
God, this is awkward.

91
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:32,760
What is?

92
00:03:32,830 --> 00:03:34,160
Being around ted.

93
00:03:34,230 --> 00:03:35,260
Why?

94
00:03:35,330 --> 00:03:37,600
-Because of our thing.-what thing?

95
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:39,430
You're really gonna pretend this never happened?

96
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:41,460
What never happened?

97
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:45,300
What are you guys talking about?

98
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,300
Nothing.

99
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,130
Guys, cut the act. I know.

100
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:54,230
I know about the surprise party you guys are throwing me.

101
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:56,100
Marshall let it slip earlier today.

102
00:03:57,130 --> 00:03:58,760
Hey, I'll totally act surprised and everything.

103
00:03:58,830 --> 00:04:00,200
Just be sure to invite stella.

104
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:01,760
Stella!

105
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:03,500
You have a serious girlfriend now!

106
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:05,000
You're over this one.

107
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:06,760
Robin who, right?

108
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:08,500
Stella makes this one look

109
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:11,000
Like a filthy bag of gbabage, am I right?

110
00:04:12,530 --> 00:04:13,830
Happy birthday, bro.

111
00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:19,760
Hello.

112
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:22,360
Hey, marshall, I need your help.

113
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:24,730
Yeah, I'm kind of real focused on the job hunt right now.

114
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,860
I know. I want to hire you.

115
00:04:26,930 --> 00:04:29,900
For the last time, barney, I will not be your butler.

116
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:31,560
I need a lawyer.

117
00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:33,100
I'll pay you.

118
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:34,800
How much?

119
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:36,000
A little.

120
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:38,260
I'll take it.

121
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:43,960
Hey. so, I'm reading this, and, I got to say,

122
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:45,630
This might be a little bit over my head.

123
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:47,930
For one thing, I'm fairly certain

124
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,960
That if these contracts aren't executed precisely,

125
00:04:50,030 --> 00:04:52,960
We will be at war with portugal.

126
00:04:53,030 --> 00:04:54,130
Forget that.

127
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:55,460
That's a tuesday for me.

128
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:57,960
New shredder.

129
00:04:58,030 --> 00:05:00,630
This baby'll chew up a bicycle in 17 seconds.

130
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:04,500
From sky mall.it's all from sky mall.

131
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,330
Whenever I get upset, I shop at sky mall.

132
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:07,930
-Want a hot dog? -of course.

133
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,630
Why are you upset?

134
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:13,030
Marshall, I'm about to tell you a secret

135
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:15,030
That you can't tell anyone-- not ted,

136
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:17,060
Not robin, not lily.

137
00:05:17,130 --> 00:05:20,230
No. no, no, no,  I don't want any more secrets,

138
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:22,060
Especially now that I know what you guys did

139
00:05:22,130 --> 00:05:24,060
To the drinking water in lisbon. i...

140
00:05:24,130 --> 00:05:26,360
You are hearing this secret, marshall.

141
00:05:26,430 --> 00:05:28,430
I... I slept...

142
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:31,030
Stop..stop doing that.

143
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:32,160
I slept...

144
00:05:36,030 --> 00:05:37,100
I slept with robin.

145
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:40,530
You slept with robin?

146
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:49,860
Are you mad at me?

147
00:05:49,930 --> 00:05:52,400
I don't know.

148
00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:54,030
How's the hot dog?

149
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:55,500
It's helping.

150
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:57,730
You slept with robin?!

151
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,160
I... I cannot keep that secret.

152
00:05:59,160 --> 00:05:59,960
I mean, you know

153
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:00,830
I at least have to tell lily.

154
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:02,130
You can't. you can't tell anyone.

155
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:03,900
Attorney-client privilege.

156
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:05,960
Why are you doing this to me?!

157
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:08,460
Because I need you, Marshall, as my lawyer,

158
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:10,300
to prove that I didn't do anying wrong.

159
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:12,400
How can I help you as your lawyer?

160
00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:14,830
You didn't break any laws, did you?

161
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:18,900
Robin knows you slept with her, doesn't she?

162
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:21,560
I didn't break any state or federal laws,

163
00:06:21,630 --> 00:06:25,130
but I think I broke a much, much higher law.

164
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:27,860
The Bro Code.

165
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:30,460
For many years,

166
00:06:30,530 --> 00:06:32,200
we had heard Barneyquote the Bro Code,

167
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:34,730
a list of do's and don'ts for all bros.

168
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,160
Some were basic.

169
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:39,330
Bro Code article one:"Bros before hoes.

170
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:41,700
Some were unbelievably complicated.

171
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:44,030
Bro Code article 89:

172
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:46,300
"The mom of a bro is always off limits,

173
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:50,600
"but the stepmom of a bro is fair game if she initiates it,

174
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:52,260
"and/or is wearing at least one a article

175
00:06:52,330 --> 00:06:54,130
of leopard print clothing."

176
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:56,000
And some werejust plain disturbing.

177
00:06:56,060 --> 00:06:58,360
Bro Code article 34:

178
00:06:58,430 --> 00:07:02,530
"Bros cannot make eye contact during a devil's three-way."

179
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:04,960
Two dudes.

180
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:09,200
This is not a legal docume..

181
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:10,530
This is just something you wrote.

182
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:12,800
You think I wrote that?

183
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:14,360
Oh, Marshall,

184
00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:18,930
don't you know the glorious history of the Bro Code?

185
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,260
The year was 1776.

186
00:07:21,330 --> 00:07:23,230
The place: Philadelphia.

187
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:26,030
Benjamin Franklin and George Washington were hangng a drink.

188
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:27,960
But, bro, seriously,

189
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:30,400
I called the dibs on that wench.

190
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:33,400
You codpiece blocked me.

191
00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:34,600
So what if I did?

192
00:07:34,660 --> 00:07:35,830
There's no rule against it.

193
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:37,130
Well, there should be.

194
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:39,130
There should be a set of rules that govern

195
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:41,600
the way bros comport themselves among other bros.

196
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:43,630
But who shall write such a document?

197
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:47,560
I have to go to Me, D.C.,and pose for the dollar bill.

198
00:07:47,630 --> 00:07:50,160
And I have to do some kite-flying or setething.

199
00:07:50,230 --> 00:07:51,900
I shall write this set of rules.

200
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:55,260
And I shall inscribe it on theacack of the Constitution.

201
00:07:55,330 --> 00:07:57,760
To save paper.

202
00:07:57,830 --> 00:07:58,960
It's resolved!

203
00:07:59,030 --> 00:08:00,660
Barney Stinson shall write...

204
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:02,700
the Bro Code.

205
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,800
And I shl l include a provision

206
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:08,960
that stateth no eye contact in a devil's three-way.

207
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:10,000
-Seconded. -Seconded.

208
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:15,200
Listen, what do you want me for?

209
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:16,730
I've just been losing my mind lately,

210
00:08:16,730 --> 00:08:18,430
and do you know why I feel so bad?

211
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:19,860
Yeah, because you slept with Robin.

212
00:08:19,930 --> 00:08:21,260
No, that was awesome.

213
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:23,730
I feel bad

214
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:25,730
because the Bro Code  clearly states

215
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,660
"No sex with your bro's ex."

216
00:08:27,730 --> 00:08:29,230
But if you,

217
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:32,030
my lawyer,can find a loophole somewhere,

218
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:34,130
then that bad feeling will go bye-bye.

219
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:36,860
And you would pay me for that?

220
00:08:36,930 --> 00:08:39,100
No, I'll just be the one shredding your paperwork.

221
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:42,000
Technically, you'll be paid  by a toy factory in Pyongyang.

222
00:08:42,060 --> 00:08:44,130
Barney, I'm no shrink, okay,

223
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:46,600
but don't you see that this is just a desperate way for you

224
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:49,660
to avoid an unpleasant confrontation with Ted?

225
00:08:49,730 --> 00:08:51,530
Hey, if I wanted a psychological evaluation,

226
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,330
I'd hire the guy we pay

227
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:54,700
to hint notize us before depositions.

228
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:56,430
Now, get cracking!

229
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:58,630
While Marshall examined   the Bro Code,

230
00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:00,730
Lily's kindergarten class welcomed a special guest.

231
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:03,660
And with a little luck, in a few days,

232
00:09:03,730 --> 00:09:05,730
Farmer Frank's cold will be all gone.

233
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:09,360
And that's why Farmer Frank's breath smells like medicine.

234
00:09:09,430 --> 00:09:11,100
Right, Farmer Frank?

235
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:12,760
You got it, toots.

236
00:09:12,830 --> 00:09:15,730
Any last questions  for Farmer Frank? Yes.

237
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:18,560
Will we ever go to see Missy the Goat again?

238
00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:20,130
Oh! Ah, isn't  that sweet!

239
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,360
Well, you know, honey,

240
00:09:21,430 --> 00:09:22,960
right after this,

241
00:09:23,030 --> 00:09:25,400
I'm gonna drop old Missy off at the butcher shop.

242
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:26,560
And they're going to take

243
00:09:26,630 --> 00:09:28,730
a great big knife...

244
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:31,260
And Frank went on to traumatize Lily's entire class

245
00:09:31,330 --> 00:09:33,400
with a graphic explanation of where meat comes from..

246
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:37,600
So not one little scrap of Missy goes to waste.

247
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:41,400
Ms. Aldrin, please don't let emem eat Missy.

248
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:51,130
I know, I know.

249
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,700
I already called an animal rescue,

250
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,800
and they're going to come get her on Monday.

251
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:58,060
Monday?! Where's she going to sleep and eat

252
00:09:58,130 --> 00:10:00,100
and go to the bathroom?!

253
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:04,900
Okay, where's she going to sleep and eat?

254
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:07,330
I-I guess  I'll keep her up on the roof.

255
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:08,960
Look, call me crazy. I just...

256
00:10:09,030 --> 00:10:11,860
I don't think having a goat in the apartment is a good idea.

257
00:10:11,930 --> 00:10:14,260
And, boy, was I right,because what Missy the Goat

258
00:10:14,330 --> 00:10:17,400
would go on to do in that bathroom was so...

259
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:18,530
No, you know what?

260
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:20,600
I'm m getting ahead of myself.

261
00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:22,130
We'll get there.

262
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,430
Hey, Ted.

263
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:26,130
You ready to, um...

264
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,700
Where'd the goat turd come from?

265
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,660
How'd you know  that was a goat turd?

266
00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:30,960
Well, it was either that,

267
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:33,000
or a musk ox turd,

268
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:35,460
and I figured,what the hell would a musk ox be doing in here?

269
00:10:35,530 --> 00:10:38,600
Hey. Guess what your wife brought home.

270
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:40,330
Attorney-client privilege.I can't talk about it.

271
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:41,500
Talk about what?

272
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:42,960
Nothing.

273
00:10:43,030 --> 00:10:44,500
How was your day?

274
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,460
Oh, goat turd on the floor,I see. Is that new?

275
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:51,760
How does everyone know that's a goat turd?

276
00:10:54,730 --> 00:10:56,260
-Barney told you. -I don't know  what you're talking about,madam.

277
00:10:56,330 --> 00:10:58,330
Marshall,

278
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:00,330
you can't look me in the eye, you're blushing,

279
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:01,460
coughing,

280
00:11:01,530 --> 00:11:02,760
and your hands are shaking.

281
00:11:02,830 --> 00:11:04,500
come here.

282
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:07,330
Ted is never finding out about this, you understand?

283
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:10,230
Because it never happened, none of us are saying anything.

284
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:11,900
And don't even think about opening that can

285
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:14,030
until I'm out of the splash zone.

286
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:29,260
fantastic, you're here.

287
00:11:29,330 --> 00:11:31,130
Give me the good news.

288
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,760
I'm sorry.

289
00:11:32,830 --> 00:11:33,900
You did too good of a job writing this thing.

290
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:35,600
It's-it's iron-clad.

291
00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:37,260
No!

292
00:11:37,330 --> 00:11:38,360
Bad lawyer!

293
00:11:38,430 --> 00:11:40,260
I need a loophole!

294
00:11:40,330 --> 00:11:42,160
I want to feel better, Marshall!

295
00:11:42,230 --> 00:11:43,960
I can't keep buying things!

296
00:11:44,030 --> 00:11:46,600
I have six self-cleaning litterboxes

297
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:48,030
and I don't even have a kid.

298
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:50,160
Wait. How about this?

299
00:11:50,230 --> 00:11:52,500
Ted's probably broken this thing himself, right?

300
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:54,430
And if he's broken the Bro Code,

301
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:55,600
then I'm off the hook.

302
00:11:55,660 --> 00:11:56,760
I thought about that.

303
00:11:56,830 --> 00:11:58,760
And I gotta say,

304
00:11:58,830 --> 00:12:01,160
Ted has upheld this thing time and time again.

305
00:12:01,230 --> 00:12:02,700
For example,  article 87:

306
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:06,430
"A bro shall at all times say yes."

307
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:08,860
So he saved you from an avalanche?

308
00:12:08,930 --> 00:12:10,530
Yes.

309
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:14,130
And he carried you six miles to safety on his broken leg?

310
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,400
Yes.

311
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:17,860
And you're a pre-op transsexual nightclub singer

312
00:12:17,930 --> 00:12:20,230
who used to be a member of the Russian mob?

313
00:12:24,330 --> 00:12:26,260
Da.

314
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:27,830
Article 29

315
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:30,930
"A bro will in a timely manner alert his bro

316
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,600
to the existence of a girl fight."

317
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:35,200
Dude, two girls are fighting  at MacLaren's.

318
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:37,930
What?!

319
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:41,500
Yeah, yeah.

320
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:43,100
It was crazy. This one girl was like...

321
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:44,460
Oh, hey.

322
00:12:44,530 --> 00:12:46,230
Hey.

323
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:47,600
Article 53:

324
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:49,960
"A bro will, whenever possible,

325
00:12:50,030 --> 00:12:52,030
provide his bro with protection."

326
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:54,000
That feels nice.

327
00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:56,000
Good.

328
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:04,400
I just wish we had some wine.

329
00:13:04,460 --> 00:13:05,730
Yeah.

330
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:07,160
I wish we had  some wine, too.

331
00:13:13,430 --> 00:13:14,860
damn it, Marshall.

332
00:13:14,930 --> 00:13:16,860
I'm not paying you to tell me what a saint Ted is!

333
00:13:16,930 --> 00:13:17,800
You're my lawyer!

334
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:20,000
The answer is in there! Find it!

335
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:22,060
Okay, this isn't about the Bro Code, and you know it.

336
00:13:22,130 --> 00:13:25,200
The reason that you're upset is because what you did was wrong.

337
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:26,530
And the only way you're ever gonna feel

338
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:29,300
any better about it is  if you tell Ted what you did.

339
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:31,700
What if he never wants to talk to me again?

340
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:33,530
Well, I guess that's just a chance

341
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,330
you're gonna have to take.

342
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:38,460
Which brings us to April 25, 2008.

343
00:13:38,530 --> 00:13:40,230
My 30th birthday,

344
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:42,930
or as it would come to be referred to in later years:

345
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,630
The Day of the Goat.

346
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:45,960
Hey, where are you?

347
00:13:46,030 --> 00:13:47,530
I'm in the limo,  right outside ofeded's office.

348
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:48,830
Great. Well, everyone's here.

349
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:50,300
Stella just arrived

350
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:52,630
and there is something here so awesome,

351
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:55,460
I'm not going to tell you what it is, but you won't believe...

352
00:13:55,530 --> 00:13:56,500
Goat in a party hat?

353
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:57,660
Damn it!

354
00:13:57,730 --> 00:14:00,000
Well, you still gotta see it.

355
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:02,660
It's so much fun having a goat at a party!

356
00:14:02,730 --> 00:14:04,000
In a few short hours,

357
00:14:04,060 --> 00:14:05,960
Lily would come to regret those words.

358
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:08,100
But we'll get there.

359
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:09,860
Uh, gotta go. Here he comes.

360
00:14:09,930 --> 00:14:11,000
Okay. Bye.

361
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:15,100
Whoa, you guys went all out.

362
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:17,160
Okay, everyone, Ted's in the limo, five-minute warning!

363
00:14:17,230 --> 00:14:18,260
Everyone get ready!

364
00:14:18,330 --> 00:14:21,460
Oh, Missy, are you excit??

365
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:24,830
Yes, you are!

366
00:14:27,030 --> 00:14:28,560
Whoa, we're leaving the city.

367
00:14:28,630 --> 00:14:29,630
Where the hell is this party?

368
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:31,460
Vegas.

369
00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:38,700
Vegas? I thought the party  was on the rooftop.

370
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:39,430
Surprise!

371
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:40,900
Just a decoy, my friend.

372
00:14:41,030 --> 00:14:42,430
So there's no roof party?

373
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:43,630
Oh, no. There is.  We're just not going.

374
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:45,530
This is how good a friend I am.

375
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,900
They want you to spent your 30th standing around

376
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:49,960
drinking flat beer ten feet above your living room.

377
00:14:50,030 --> 00:14:51,330
But not me, bro.

378
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:53,230
I pulled out all the stops.

379
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:56,660
Private jet, Valderrama suite at the Bellagio.

380
00:14:56,730 --> 00:14:58,300
Steaks at BOA,

381
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:02,000
scotch at Ghostbar, then two ringside seats

382
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:04,100
to watch Floyd Mayatather go ten rounds with,

383
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:05,260
wait for it...

384
00:15:05,330 --> 00:15:06,400
a grizzly bear!

385
00:15:06,460 --> 00:15:09,000
Take me home, Barney.

386
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:10,030
No!

387
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:11,630
We have to go to Vegas.

388
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:16,300
Look, Ted, I didn't want to say this, but...

389
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:17,660
there's something that I have to tell you,

390
00:15:17,730 --> 00:15:19,430
and I wanted you to be

391
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:21,300
in the best possible frame of mind before you heard it.

392
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:22,400
You slept with Robin.

393
00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:27,030
Ranjit!

394
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:28,330
You slept with Robin?

395
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:32,130
Barney! That is Ted's ex-girlfriend!

396
00:15:38,730 --> 00:15:40,200
When did you find out?

397
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:42,830
Hey, Robin. Come here!

398
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:44,560
What's up?

399
00:15:44,630 --> 00:15:47,100
I was, uh, just going through some old stuff

400
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:49,130
-and I... -Oh, crap!

401
00:15:51,930 --> 00:15:53,530
Anyway, uh,

402
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:54,960
I came across this.

403
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:58,660
-From my vacacation in Vermont. -Yeah.

404
00:15:58,730 --> 00:16:00,630
I don't know if you'd even want it, but if you do, it's yours.

405
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:02,130
I slept with Barney!

406
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:03,560
What?

407
00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:05,300
It was just one time,

408
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:07,560
it, it was the night that Simon dumped me

409
00:16:07,630 --> 00:16:09,300
and I was in a really vulnerable place

410
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:12,430
and I, I wand d to just pretend like it never happened,

411
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:14,300
but I couldn't, and...

412
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:16,030
I can't.

413
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:19,300
I just, I had to tell you.

414
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:20,930
And...

415
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,800
I just hope that we can still be friends.

416
00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:26,460
Of course we can still be friends.

417
00:16:26,530 --> 00:16:28,130
So you're not mad?

418
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:29,830
Well, I'm...

419
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:31,830
it's a little weird, but, um,

420
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:33,960
No, I'm not mad.

421
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:40,660
So you're not mad?

422
00:16:40,730 --> 00:16:42,930
No, I'm not mad.

423
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,960
I mean, Robin and I broke up a year ago.

424
00:16:45,030 --> 00:16:47,330
We've, we've both dated lots of people since then.

425
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:48,700
I'm with Stella now.

426
00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:51,630
Seriously, I...I'm fine with this.

427
00:16:52,930 --> 00:16:54,860
I'm so relieved to hear you say that.

428
00:16:54,930 --> 00:16:56,700
Yeah. Yeah.

429
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:58,460
Oh, hey, I just remembered, um,

430
00:16:58,530 --> 00:17:00,530
my mom is coming into town next month.

431
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:02,960
Maybe you'd like to nail her, too!

432
00:17:03,030 --> 00:17:05,000
Where are they?! I'm getting a cramp.

433
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:08,160
Marshall, can we keep the goat?

434
00:17:08,230 --> 00:17:09,900
No.

435
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:11,860
-But she's so cute and furry and soft. -Yeah,

436
00:17:11,930 --> 00:17:13,730
and she also sheds, eats out of the garbage

437
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:14,860
and can't control her bobowels.

438
00:17:14,930 --> 00:17:16,500
Why don't we just call Duluth Mental Hospital

439
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:18,800
and say my Uncle Linus can live with us?

440
00:17:18,860 --> 00:17:20,530
Yeah, Lily, that may seem like a good idea

441
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:22,330
after a couple of drinks but tomorrow morning

442
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,060
you're going to want this thing out of your house.

443
00:17:24,130 --> 00:17:26,200
Oh, you should talk.You slept with Barney.

444
00:17:26,260 --> 00:17:26,900
Marshall!

445
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:27,930
I'm sorry!

446
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,300
I couldn't take it anymore.

447
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:31,200
I can't believe  you did that.

448
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:32,800
That's so gross.

449
00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:34,730
Was it amazing?

450
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:36,430
What? I...

451
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:38,460
Lily, I really don't want to talk about this.

452
00:17:38,530 --> 00:17:40,500
I know but it's Barney.

453
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:42,200
It's just hard not to be curious.

454
00:17:43,530 --> 00:17:45,330
Did he have like devices and stuff?

455
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:46,700
Lily,come on.

456
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:47,930
-Hot wax? -Stop it.

457
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:48,930
Did he tie you to anything?

458
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,300
-That's enough.  -What's wrong with you?

459
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:51,160
I'm sorry.

460
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:57,560
Is he all smooth down there?

461
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:01,660
Three billion women on the planet!

462
00:18:01,730 --> 00:18:03,630
Three billion!

463
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:05,700
And you have to sleep with the one that I dated for a year!

464
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:08,100
Are you kidding me? Are you kidding me?!

465
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:08,400
Robin?!

466
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:09,960
You think I'm proud of this?!

467
00:18:10,030 --> 00:18:11,830
I'm horrified that this happened.

468
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:13,260
How did it happen? Huh?

469
00:18:13,330 --> 00:18:14,730
Barney, I want to know.

470
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:16,900
Tell me exactly how it happened.

471
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:18,760
You mean...

472
00:18:18,830 --> 00:18:20,360
what position?

473
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:21,330
Okay.

474
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:21,930
Stop it!

475
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,260
Stop it!

476
00:18:23,330 --> 00:18:24,760
Stop it.

477
00:18:24,830 --> 00:18:24,900
-Hit him! Hit him, -Ted! Stop!

478
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,360
-Hit him! -Stop!

479
00:18:27,430 --> 00:18:28,300
-Hit him! -Okay.

480
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:29,800
Okay. Okay.

481
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:31,130
You're pissed.

482
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,260
You deserve to be.

483
00:18:32,330 --> 00:18:33,300
Fine. You know what?

484
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:35,300
One free shot. On me.

485
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:36,900
Anywhere but the face.

486
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:44,960
Who punches someone in the groin?

487
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:48,030
Okay.Okay.

488
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:49,200
I deserved that.

489
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:51,660
I deserved that.

490
00:18:51,730 --> 00:18:53,700
But what's important now is...

491
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:56,960
we're passed this whole Robin thing now, right?

492
00:18:57,030 --> 00:18:58,960
You think that this is just about Robin?

493
00:18:59,030 --> 00:19:00,600
This is about...

494
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:04,100
You know, I've seen you do some bad stuff.

495
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:06,500
I mean some really terrible stuff

496
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:08,030
to a lot of different people.

497
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:10,230
I just always thought there had to be a limit.

498
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:12,460
I always thought I was the limit.

499
00:19:12,530 --> 00:19:16,860
You're always spouting off  these rules for bros.

500
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:19,100
Isn't one of them, "don't do this"?

501
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:21,400
Yeah. And I broke it.

502
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:23,260
I'm sorry.

503
00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:25,760
But, Ted...

504
00:19:27,260 --> 00:19:29,260
...seriously, this suite at the Bellagio...

505
00:19:29,330 --> 00:19:31,500
I am not going to Vegas with you!

506
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:32,960
I'm not going to blow off my friends

507
00:19:33,030 --> 00:19:34,760
and my girlfriend,

508
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:37,230
and spend my 30th birthday in a strip club.

509
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:39,130
The fact that you think I would...

510
00:19:40,830 --> 00:19:42,700
You know, Barney,earlier this week

511
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:44,400
I started putting things in a box

512
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:47,330
and that box was labeled "stuff I have no use for anymore."

513
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:49,260
What does that mean?

514
00:19:49,330 --> 00:19:51,130
It means...

515
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:53,200
maybe you belong in that box.

516
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:57,130
Are you saying you dnon't want to be bros anymore?

517
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:00,600
I'm saying I don't want to be friends anymore.

518
00:20:02,130 --> 00:20:04,600
Okay, I'm going to stop you right there,

519
00:20:04,660 --> 00:20:07,300
because it seems like you're about to say something

520
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:09,000
that's going to pretty much ruin Vegas.

521
00:20:09,060 --> 00:20:10,660
Ranjit, stop the car.

522
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:14,030
I'm getting a cab.

523
00:20:50,430 --> 00:20:53,000
Surprise!

524
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:02,130
Oh, right, the goat.

525
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:03,600
So funny.You're going to love this.

526
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:06,700
So later in that night, the goat locked himself in the bathroom

527
00:21:06,830 --> 00:21:08,600
and was eating oneof Robin's washcloths and

528
00:21:08,660 --> 00:21:10,230
wait, hold on.

529
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:12,160
Robin wasn't living here on my 30th birthday.

530
00:21:12,230 --> 00:21:13,560
When did this happen?

531
00:21:13,630 --> 00:21:16,930
Oh, wait, the goat was there on my 31st birthday.

532
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,760
Sorry,I totally got that wrong.
