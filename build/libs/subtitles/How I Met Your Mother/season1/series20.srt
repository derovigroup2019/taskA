- Van Smoot is available.
- Oh, my God.

5

9
00:00:38,738 --> 00:00:40,899
There was a cancellation
two months from now.

10
00:00:41,007 --> 00:00:43,305
You want to have our wedding
in two months?

11
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:44,877
No. It's impossible.

12
00:00:44,978 --> 00:00:47,446
It's Van Smoot, Lily. It's the dream.

13
00:00:47,914 --> 00:00:50,576
No, there's just not enough time.
There's no...

Mini-vomit.

15
00:00:52,919 --> 00:00:55,581
Okay, look, look, look.
I know that it's sudden, but check it.

16
00:00:55,688 --> 00:00:58,782
If we don't take this, guess who's
on their way with a deposit check?

17
00:00:58,892 --> 00:01:00,120
Todd and Valerie?

Todd and Valerie are in motion.

Van Smoot!

24
00:01:19,012 --> 00:01:20,741
No! Kids, color!

30
00:01:53,246 --> 00:01:57,114
I can't believe it.
We got Van Smoot House.

31

It is on. It is on! Like the former
Soviet Republic of Azerbaijan.

- What?
- You're a wonder.

33
00:02:04,891 --> 00:02:06,950
Wow. You guys are getting married
in two months.

34
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:08,425
How are you going to get
everything done?

35
00:02:08,528 --> 00:02:11,827
Division of labor.
Everyone's got a job to do, so listen up.

36
00:02:11,931 --> 00:02:14,798
Okay, Robin, you and Ted go to the florist.

- Was it...
- It was your girlfriend.

40
00:02:25,478 --> 00:02:27,469
You might want to call her back.

41
00:02:27,981 --> 00:02:31,815
Or, actually, Robin,
why don't you go to the florist?

42
00:02:31,918 --> 00:02:36,753
And, Ted, I could use your keen
architectural eye on the invitations.

43
00:02:37,457 --> 00:02:40,085
Wow, that was really awkward, Lil.

44
00:02:42,362 --> 00:02:45,354
And still.
It's still really awkward right now.

45
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,361
Hey, what about me? What's my job?
What do I get to do?

46
00:02:49,469 --> 00:02:51,096
Okay, your job is very simple.

47
00:02:51,204 --> 00:02:55,937
At the wedding, do not sleep with
anyone even remotely related to me.

48

(LAUGHS)

49
00:02:58,912 --> 00:03:01,472
Lil, you know I can't promise that.

50
00:03:07,754 --> 00:03:10,518
Look how cute she looks. All tuckered out.

51
00:03:12,225 --> 00:03:16,559
Hey, babe. Hey, little one. Hey, Lilypad.

52
00:03:16,663 --> 00:03:19,723
Crap! Band! We forgot a band!

53
00:03:19,832 --> 00:03:22,665

and then people chewing.

54
00:03:22,769 --> 00:03:26,705
(SHUSHING)
Baby, don't worry about it. I called The 88!

55
00:03:26,973 --> 00:03:28,600
- Who?
- The 88.

56
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:31,506
They're this awesome band.
They played my law review party.

57
00:03:31,611 --> 00:03:34,444
They were found guilty.
On three counts of rocking.

58
00:03:34,547 --> 00:03:36,674
Yeah, I saw them two months ago
at my cousin Bonzo's wedding.

59
00:03:36,783 --> 00:03:37,772
They were great.

60
00:03:37,884 --> 00:03:40,648
John "Bonzo" Bonham from Led Zeppelin?

61
00:03:40,753 --> 00:03:44,052
Yes, Lily, my cousin, the drummer
from Led Zeppelin who died in 1980,

62
00:03:44,157 --> 00:03:46,216
got married two months ago.

63
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:50,020
Look, I can't sign off on a band
I've never even seen.

64
00:03:50,129 --> 00:03:52,154
We don't even know
if they can play our song.

65
00:03:52,265 --> 00:03:54,790
They're going to have to
come over here and audition.

66
00:03:54,901 --> 00:03:58,837
Baby, The 88 don't audition. They're like
The Wiggles of wedding bands.

67
00:03:59,138 --> 00:04:01,299
Well, then I have to say no.

68
00:04:02,942 --> 00:04:05,570
Baby, they're only holding the date
until Monday.

69
00:04:05,678 --> 00:04:08,203
Well, are they playing
anywhere this weekend?

70
00:04:08,915 --> 00:04:10,678
Let me check their website.

71
00:04:11,918 --> 00:04:13,112
What?

72
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:15,687
Lily, you're being a wee bit intense
about this band thing.

73
00:04:15,788 --> 00:04:21,192
Intense? I have a wedding to plan
in nine weeks for 200 people.

74

should poke his head out of my butt

75
00:04:24,597 --> 00:04:26,292
and consume this coffee table,

76
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:29,630
- I need you to roll with it, okay?
- Wow.

77
00:04:30,603 --> 00:04:33,868
Guys. I just tasted an amazing caterer.

78
00:04:33,973 --> 00:04:37,409
- We already have a caterer.
- Oh, right. You're getting married.

79
00:04:37,577 --> 00:04:39,670
You see what I did there?

80
00:04:40,246 --> 00:04:44,205
It looks like The 88 are playing
at a high school prom

81
00:04:44,317 --> 00:04:46,182
in New Jersey tomorrow.

82
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:48,345
A prom? Can we go to that?

83
00:04:48,454 --> 00:04:52,481
Yeah, we'll just call the high school,
they'll let us stand in the back and watch.

84
00:04:53,493 --> 00:04:55,324
- Yeah. No, they won't.
- Why not?

85
00:04:55,428 --> 00:04:57,293
'Cause it turns out
we're not in high school.

86
00:04:57,397 --> 00:04:58,796
No sweat, we'll just sneak in.

87
00:04:58,898 --> 00:05:00,923
We're not sneaking
into a high school prom.

88
00:05:01,034 --> 00:05:02,899
Yes, we are. It's the only way.

89
00:05:03,002 --> 00:05:04,492
You're getting on board
with Barney's idea?

90
00:05:04,604 --> 00:05:06,538
Man, you really have snapped.

91
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:09,039
It's nine weeks till the wedding.
At this point,

92
00:05:09,142 --> 00:05:11,372
I'd say yes to just about anything.

93
00:05:11,477 --> 00:05:13,138
- Well...
- No, Barney.

94
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:20,883

<i>hatched the plan to crash a prom,</i>

- I'll go with you.
- Really?

96
00:05:22,689 --> 00:05:24,179
Yeah, I never got to go to my prom.

The cough is supposed to cover
the "lesbian."

No, I'm trying to start a thing
where the cough is separate.

102
00:05:35,735 --> 00:05:38,465
Do you think we look young enough
to blend in at a high school?

just needs a good night's sleep,

written all over your body.

Hey, why don't we all go?

106
00:05:46,546 --> 00:05:48,639
I don't know.
More people might be harder to sneak in.

107
00:05:48,748 --> 00:05:51,080
We don't want to mess things up for Lily.

108
00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:54,085
Yeah, you're right. Besides, Marshall and I
have been planning

109

before the wedding.

and you get so drunk
you throw up, it'll be sad,

170
00:08:49,295 --> 00:08:52,162
but if we do it tonight, it'll be less sad.

171

Okay, it'll be cool. I'll tell you what.
We'll make a game out of it.

I was wondering if you guys could
play <i>Good Feeling</i> by the Violent Femmes.

wants to hire you guys as the band,

but I can't sign off on it
until I hear you play <i>Good Feeling</i>

215
00:11:19,845 --> 00:11:21,039

Look, I'm kind of wasted right now,
so I didn't understand any of that.

Guess we're hall mates.

329
00:17:50,302 --> 00:17:51,269
Yeah.

331
00:17:54,373 --> 00:17:55,931
It works.

332
00:17:56,442 --> 00:18:00,708
- Violent Femmes. I love this song.
- Me, too.

333
00:18:03,816 --> 00:18:07,343
I didn't have any of the experiences
I set out to.

334
00:18:08,353 --> 00:18:13,757
The travel, the bohemian art life,
my big lesbian experience.

335
00:18:14,226 --> 00:18:16,057
I didn't do any of it.

336
00:18:16,962 --> 00:18:20,557
Lily, you're marrying
your best friend in the world.

337
00:18:20,866 --> 00:18:24,563
I mean, isn't that worth
all the other experiences combined?

338
00:18:26,004 --> 00:18:27,130
Yeah.

339
00:18:27,506 --> 00:18:31,101
And, look, you can still travel.
I mean, you can still paint.

340
00:18:31,210 --> 00:18:33,906
And as far as your lesbian experience...

341
00:18:37,216 --> 00:18:38,911
- Happy?
- Yeah.

342
00:18:39,952 --> 00:18:42,284
- So field hockey, huh?
- Shut up.

343
00:18:44,990 --> 00:18:47,754
Trespassing, assaulting a minor.

344
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:50,795
And this mascot costume you stole
cost $5,000.

345
00:18:51,396 --> 00:18:53,455
We can have you guys arrested,
you know that?

346
00:18:53,565 --> 00:18:55,931
Oh, come on, you're the one who let in
a kid with nunchucks.

347
00:18:56,034 --> 00:18:58,798
You call yourself security guards?
I was just defending my boy here.

348
00:18:58,904 --> 00:19:01,964
- I totally could have taken that kid.
- Yeah, and I totally had your back, so...

349
00:19:02,074 --> 00:19:05,009
- Well, I didn't need it, but thanks.
- Yeah, you did, and you're welcome.

350
00:19:05,110 --> 00:19:08,011
No, the kid was totally like
a white belt and I'm gigantic.

351
00:19:08,113 --> 00:19:11,640
Listen, guys, I'm sorry. Please, I just need
to get in there for one more song.

352
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:13,274
Absolutely not.

353
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:17,421
You guys will thank me
for this later, okay?

354
00:19:18,090 --> 00:19:22,049
- Listen, Don, Ray, can't we all...
- Hey!

355
00:19:24,696 --> 00:19:27,392
You know, for a turtle,
he's surprisingly quick.

356
00:19:30,302 --> 00:19:33,829
This one goes out to that redhead girl
and that tall guy.

358
00:19:58,564 --> 00:20:01,590
- So, how was your first prom?
- You tell me.

359
00:20:01,967 --> 00:20:06,995
I hated my dress, my date got wasted
and puked on me, there was a huge fight,

360
00:20:07,105 --> 00:20:08,834
and I kissed a girl.

361
00:20:09,274 --> 00:20:11,265
So, basically, it was a prom.

362
00:20:11,376 --> 00:20:12,365
(LAUGHS)

363
00:20:13,345 --> 00:20:17,679
Okay, I've missed you.
Not in a we're-going-to-make-out way,

364
00:20:18,584 --> 00:20:23,487
not even in an l-forgive-you way.
Just in an I've-missed-you way.

365
00:20:25,090 --> 00:20:26,785
I'll take what I can get.

366
00:20:29,595 --> 00:20:32,621
And that, my friends, is why
you don't get your money's worth

00:20:32,731 --> 00:20:35,063
when you wear jeans to a strip club.

368
00:20:38,303 --> 00:20:41,568
So you got to admit,
The 88 are rocking our song.

369
00:20:42,007 --> 00:20:43,565
Yeah, it's good.

370
00:20:44,343 --> 00:20:46,140
Band. Check.

371
00:20:47,746 --> 00:20:50,647
Two months, baby. Two months.

372
00:20:52,884 --> 00:20:54,215
Two months.

373
00:21:02,861 --> 00:21:03,259
Two months.
