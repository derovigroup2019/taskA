OLDER TED: Kids, the thing about
New Year's Eve is that it sucks.

00:00:19,419 --> 00:00:20,750
<i>Sure it looks great on TV,</i>

2
00:00:20,854 --> 00:00:22,981
<i>But in reality,</i>
<i>it's always just a big letdown,</i>

3
00:00:23,089 --> 00:00:26,456
<i>But in 2005,</i>
<i>I attempted to do the impossible;</i>

4
00:00:26,559 --> 00:00:28,459
<i>to give my friends a great New Year's Eve,</i>

5
00:00:28,561 --> 00:00:30,222
<i>I had an idea of how to do it, too,</i>

6
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:32,730
<i>and all it cost was</i>
<i>half my Christmas bonus,</i>

7
00:00:41,474 --> 00:00:44,568
Yeah, that's right. A limo.

8
00:00:51,418 --> 00:00:55,514
- ROBIN: Oh, man, Ted, this is great.
- Okay, people, let's talk strategy.

9
00:00:55,655 --> 00:00:58,783
Last New Year's,
we went our separate ways, and it sucked.

10
00:00:58,892 --> 00:01:01,486
This year, we party together, or not at all.

11
00:01:01,594 --> 00:01:03,391
Now, I sifted through
your party submissions,

12
00:01:03,496 --> 00:01:06,090
- and I narrowed them down to these five.
- Question.

13
00:01:06,199 --> 00:01:07,962
Yes, Barney,
your submissions were received,

14
00:01:08,068 --> 00:01:11,003
and no, we will not be attending
any parties in your pants.

15

16
00:01:12,238 --> 00:01:15,833

That was an actual picture of my pants.

17
00:01:15,942 --> 00:01:17,000
Yeah.

18
00:01:17,110 --> 00:01:18,941
We will hit all five parties before midnight,

19
00:01:19,045 --> 00:01:20,672
and then narrow them down to one,

20
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:23,044
the most awesome party
in New York City,

21
00:01:23,149 --> 00:01:27,381
and that is where we will ring,
nay, rock in the new year.

22
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:31,078
All right, and party number one,
that's where we get to meet Marybeth?

23
00:01:31,191 --> 00:01:33,557
- Marybeth?
- Oh, she works in my office.

24
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:35,423
She seems like she might be into me.

25
00:01:35,528 --> 00:01:38,964

"Barney, how is it that you're so psyched

- By who? Who asks you that?

My own, personal, get-psyched mix.

32
00:01:54,848 --> 00:01:57,043
Now, people often think
a good mix should rise and fall,

33
00:01:57,150 --> 00:02:01,917
but people are wrong.
It should be all rise, baby.

34
00:02:02,021 --> 00:02:04,785

for an audio journey

Yeah, it turns out she was asleep
in the front seat the whole time.

330
00:18:48,293 --> 00:18:50,784
- Ranjit, why didn't you tell me?
- I didn't want to wake her.

331
00:18:50,896 --> 00:18:52,193
She looked so peaceful.

Dudes, I'm sure
party number five is awesome.
