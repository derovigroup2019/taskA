OLDER TED: So, kids, there are
many buildings in New York City.

1
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:22,520
<i>Thousands of apartments,</i>
<i>Millions of stories,</i>

2
00:00:23,289 --> 00:00:26,850
<i>And even though it's been decades,</i>
<i>and someone else lives there now,</i>

3
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:31,454
<i>there's one apartment in particular,</i>
<i>that will always be our apartment,</i>

4
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:34,924
<i>I have so many great memories</i>
<i>of that place,</i>

5
00:00:35,035 --> 00:00:37,230
<i>Marshall playing video games,</i>

6
00:00:37,570 --> 00:00:39,970
<i>Lily painting on the fire escape,</i>

7
00:00:40,807 --> 00:00:43,901
- MAN: Hey!
- Sorry, Mr. Matson!

8
00:00:45,111 --> 00:00:48,205
<i>And me making the coffee,</i>
<i>I had this coffee pot,</i>

9
00:00:48,314 --> 00:00:52,808
<i>It was probably 50 years old at that time,</i>
<i>and it made truly terrible coffee,</i>

10
00:00:52,919 --> 00:00:54,648
<i>We called it Shocky,</i>

11
00:00:55,021 --> 00:00:57,046
- Plugging in.
- Saving game.

12
00:00:59,526 --> 00:01:00,618
(GASPING)

13
00:01:01,861 --> 00:01:04,056
<i>I loved every last detail of that place,</i>

14
00:01:04,164 --> 00:01:07,565
<i>right down to the incredibly tacky swords</i>
<i>we hung on the wall,</i>

15
00:01:07,667 --> 00:01:11,797
<i>I never wanted any of it to change,</i>
<i>but that's not how life works,</i>

16
00:01:14,074 --> 00:01:16,565
You guys will never believe
what just happened to us.

17
00:01:16,676 --> 00:01:18,268
I don't even believe it myself.

18
00:01:18,378 --> 00:01:21,643
We were in Queens
and we decided to stop by my apartment.

19
00:01:21,748 --> 00:01:23,215
Wait, her apartment?

20
00:01:23,316 --> 00:01:25,614
I thought Aunt Lily lived with you
and Uncle Marshall.

21
00:01:25,718 --> 00:01:29,677
I could see how you would think that,
but I have to have my own place.

22
00:01:29,789 --> 00:01:31,279
It's an independence thing.

23
00:01:31,391 --> 00:01:35,020
- When was the last time you were there?
- Three months ago.

24
00:01:35,328 --> 00:01:37,819
What? It's like fat pants.

25
00:01:37,931 --> 00:01:42,425
You hope you never have to use them,
but you're glad to know they're there.

26
00:01:44,003 --> 00:01:45,800
- What the hell?
- What?

27
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,837
This is my apartment.

28
00:01:49,175 --> 00:01:51,370
- Where?
- Right here!

29
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:54,970
What the hell?

30
00:01:55,682 --> 00:01:57,479
Lily, this is a Chinese restaurant.

31
00:01:57,584 --> 00:02:00,678
No! No! This was my apartment!

32
00:02:01,221 --> 00:02:04,384
My dresser was right... That's my dresser!

33
00:02:05,325 --> 00:02:07,885
And this is my closet.

34
00:02:08,428 --> 00:02:12,592
And I spilled nail polish there.
There's the stain!

35
00:02:12,999 --> 00:02:14,466
Hi, how many?

36
00:02:15,001 --> 00:02:17,697
- Lily!
- Yes. You know me?

37
00:02:17,804 --> 00:02:22,673
Yeah, from your homecoming picture.
You're much prettier in the person.

38
00:02:23,776 --> 00:02:26,506
Yeah, I know, the bangs were a mistake.

39
00:02:26,613 --> 00:02:27,944
Where is my stuff?

40
00:02:28,047 --> 00:02:31,175
It's all in the back.
We could wrap it up for you.

41
00:02:31,284 --> 00:02:32,945
You want it to go?

42
00:02:33,219 --> 00:02:36,916
- This is my apartment.
- Not anymore.

43
00:02:38,124 --> 00:02:40,092
No way. You're making this up.

44
00:02:40,193 --> 00:02:42,593
Yeah, the building would've had
to give you some kind of notice.

45
00:02:42,695 --> 00:02:44,356
They sent you a notice about this.

46
00:02:44,464 --> 00:02:46,796
- When?
- Three month ago.

47
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:49,528
And here's your mail. Minus magazines.

48
00:02:50,837 --> 00:02:54,637
Well, still, legally they can't just toss you
out on the street, you have a lease.

49
00:02:54,741 --> 00:02:57,710
Okay, so I didn't have
a written lease as such.

50
00:02:57,810 --> 00:03:00,973
But go ask my landlady, Mrs. Conroy.

51
00:03:01,214 --> 00:03:03,910
She may be 98 years old, but she still...

52
00:03:05,151 --> 00:03:06,550
She's dead, isn't she?

53
00:03:06,653 --> 00:03:08,587
Never even saw the bus.

54
00:03:09,789 --> 00:03:13,225
My apartment is a Chinese restaurant.

55
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:16,456
- What am I gonna do?
- Come live with us.

56
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:18,925
- Really?
- Of course.

57
00:03:19,332 --> 00:03:21,163
- You sure about this, Ted?
- Yeah.

58
00:03:21,267 --> 00:03:24,828
I mean, you basically live here anyway.
It's not like it'll change anything.

59
00:03:24,938 --> 00:03:27,429
No, it's like it'll change everything!

60
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:29,872
Oh, Ted! You are so screwed.

61
00:03:29,976 --> 00:03:34,140
- What are you talking about?
- And why is that girl checking you out?

62
00:03:34,247 --> 00:03:35,976
Because I look good.

63
00:03:36,616 --> 00:03:39,380
BARNEY: Now focus.
You and Marshall are roommates.

64
00:03:39,485 --> 00:03:42,545
You have an amazing apartment.
Marshall and Lily just got engaged.

65
00:03:42,655 --> 00:03:43,781
Yeah. So?

66
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:46,984
So, you're not still gonna be his roommate
when he gets married, are you?

67
00:03:47,093 --> 00:03:49,220
Someone's going to move out.
So, who's it going to be?

68
00:03:49,329 --> 00:03:52,093
Come on, Barney, I'm sure they've talked
about who gets the apartment.

69
00:03:52,198 --> 00:03:53,790
You've talked about
who gets the apartment, right?

70
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:55,561
Yeah, we've talked about it.

71
00:03:56,002 --> 00:03:58,835
So, when Lily and I get married,

72
00:03:59,906 --> 00:04:03,603
- who's gonna get the apartment?
- That's a tough one.

73
00:04:04,911 --> 00:04:07,675
You know who I think
could handle a problem like that?

74
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:11,409
- Who?
- Future Ted and Future Marshall.

75
00:04:13,086 --> 00:04:15,850
Totally. Let's let those guys handle it.

76
00:04:16,389 --> 00:04:17,981
Damn it, Past Ted!

77
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:20,783
You blew it, dude.

78
00:04:20,893 --> 00:04:22,986
Now that Lily's there,
it's a whole new dynamic.

79
00:04:23,096 --> 00:04:25,087
- They're edging you out.
- That's crazy.

80
00:04:25,198 --> 00:04:28,224
They're not edging me out.
Marshall's my best friend.

81
00:04:28,334 --> 00:04:30,359
One of my best friends.

82
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:32,929
He wouldn't do that to me.

83
00:04:33,172 --> 00:04:35,663
Just keep your eyes open.
That's all I'm saying, Teddy.

84
00:04:35,775 --> 00:04:38,539
Little things are gonna be changing
around that apartment.

85
00:04:38,645 --> 00:04:40,442
Come on, Barney,
you're just being paranoid.

86
00:04:40,546 --> 00:04:43,344
Okay, seriously, what is this girl's deal?

87
00:04:44,651 --> 00:04:46,676
- Sort of on a date with her.
- What?

88
00:04:46,786 --> 00:04:49,846
Yeah, yeah. I found her online.

89
00:04:49,956 --> 00:04:53,687
I'm tired of the whole bar scene,
the one-night hookups.

90
00:04:53,793 --> 00:04:55,852
I'm looking for a soul mate.

91
00:04:55,962 --> 00:04:58,362
Someone who I can love and cuddle.

92
00:04:58,865 --> 00:05:01,060
Or, so it says in my profile.

93
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:04,035
(LAUGHS MANIACALLY)

94
00:05:04,137 --> 00:05:09,871
But this girl, she wants the same stuff,
and it's bumming me out.

95
00:05:10,009 --> 00:05:11,840
All right, Ted, call me from the hospital.

96
00:05:11,944 --> 00:05:13,536
- All right.
- You're going to the hospital?

97
00:05:13,646 --> 00:05:15,739
No, see, he's gonna go back over there.
I'm gonna call him.

98
00:05:15,848 --> 00:05:17,110
He's gonna pretend it's an emergency call

99
00:05:17,216 --> 00:05:18,706
from a family member at the hospital.

100
00:05:18,818 --> 00:05:20,979
Oh, Lord! The fake emergency?

101
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:24,487
That is the lamest,
most pathetic cop-out in the book.

102
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:25,887
I expect more from you, Barney.

103
00:05:25,992 --> 00:05:28,688
Well, stay tuned.
I'm working on some stuff.

104
00:05:28,795 --> 00:05:31,229
But in the meantime, wish me luck.

105
00:05:33,099 --> 00:05:35,499
So, are you gonna talk to Marshall?

106
00:05:35,601 --> 00:05:38,069
He's gonna want the apartment.
I'm gonna want the apartment.

107
00:05:38,171 --> 00:05:42,130
- It's gonna lead to an argument. So, no.
- That's real healthy.

108
00:05:42,475 --> 00:05:46,673
So, when a serious issue comes up,
your response is just to avoid it?

109
00:05:47,447 --> 00:05:49,745
I should really make this call.

110
00:05:50,149 --> 00:05:51,741
Oh, can I do it?

111
00:05:55,254 --> 00:05:56,414
(CELL PHONE RINGING)

112
00:05:56,522 --> 00:05:57,887
Excuse me.

113
00:05:59,158 --> 00:06:01,649
- Hello.
- Hi there, sexy.

114
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:06,059
- Hello, Aunt Kathy. What's up?
- Oh, nothing.

115
00:06:06,399 --> 00:06:09,766
Just sitting here,
thinking about you, hot stuff.

116
00:06:10,503 --> 00:06:11,936
An accident?

117
00:06:12,438 --> 00:06:14,872
Well, is Uncle Rudy gonna be okay?

118
00:06:15,508 --> 00:06:20,002
Aunt Kathy's got an itch
that only you can scratch, big boy.

119
00:06:21,748 --> 00:06:23,079
Oh, God!

120
00:06:23,182 --> 00:06:26,447
Why did he think
he could build his own helicopter?

121
00:06:26,753 --> 00:06:27,981
Come on, Daddy.

122
00:06:28,087 --> 00:06:31,022
Break me off a piece
of that white chocolate.

123
00:06:32,625 --> 00:06:35,651
Well, if he needs a transplant,
he can have mine.

124
00:06:35,762 --> 00:06:37,491
I'll be right there.

125
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:39,220
You know, I...

126
00:06:42,335 --> 00:06:43,427
(SOBBING)

127
00:06:43,536 --> 00:06:45,231
See you guys later.

128
00:06:45,872 --> 00:06:47,464
(SOBBING) Put it on my tab.

129
00:06:49,876 --> 00:06:53,676
This'll be nice.
The three of us living together.

130
00:06:54,747 --> 00:06:56,772
I think it's a good setup.

131
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:59,718
Man, this coffee's great.

132
00:07:01,354 --> 00:07:03,015
It's really great.

133
00:07:05,758 --> 00:07:07,055
Too great.

134
00:07:10,363 --> 00:07:12,331
What happened to Shocky?

135
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:13,626
(GASPS)

136
00:07:20,239 --> 00:07:23,367
- What's this?
- My coffee maker. From my apartment.

137
00:07:23,476 --> 00:07:26,604
- Makes great coffee, right?
- Yeah, definitely.

138
00:07:27,046 --> 00:07:28,980
I mean, so does Shocky.

139
00:07:29,081 --> 00:07:33,074
Really? I always thought Shocky's coffee
tasted kind of rusty.

140
00:07:33,352 --> 00:07:35,013
Yeah. No. It did.

141
00:07:35,121 --> 00:07:37,885
I mean, I kind of like the rusty taste.

142
00:07:38,658 --> 00:07:40,853
I'm used to it. I don't know.

143
00:07:41,127 --> 00:07:44,995
Also, Lily's coffee maker doesn't,
you know, shock people.

144
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:49,333
No, it's just...
You gotta admit that shock, that...

145
00:07:49,435 --> 00:07:51,528
(GRUNTS) Wakes you up in the morning.

146
00:07:51,637 --> 00:07:53,696
You know what else wakes you up
in the morning?

147
00:07:53,806 --> 00:07:55,000
Coffee.

148
00:07:56,509 --> 00:07:58,568
That's great. You're right.

149
00:07:59,679 --> 00:08:02,375
Roomies! I love it.

150
00:08:03,816 --> 00:08:06,580
They're edging me out.
They're totally edging me out.

151
00:08:06,686 --> 00:08:10,281
- I didn't believe it, but you're right.
- Told you. That Lily, she's a shrewd one.

152
00:08:10,389 --> 00:08:13,222
Yeah. She got you
a nice new coffee maker.

153
00:08:13,326 --> 00:08:16,853
- How dare she?
- It's not just the coffee maker.

154
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:19,825
Done. The painting's done.

155
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:23,125
- That is great.
- Nice.

156
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:26,805
- Where do you wanna hang it?
- I don't know.

157
00:08:28,174 --> 00:08:29,698
Over the piano?

158
00:08:30,643 --> 00:08:33,009
Yeah, that would be a good place for it.

159
00:08:33,112 --> 00:08:36,809
Too bad the swords are there.
We kind of love those swords.

160
00:08:38,584 --> 00:08:40,950
Well, those swords have been up there
a long time.

161
00:08:41,053 --> 00:08:43,783
I know, right. I'd really miss them, too.

162
00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:46,315
So maybe Marshall's room.

163
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:48,752
Okay.

164
00:08:50,129 --> 00:08:52,996
He was gonna take the swords down!
Can you believe that?

165
00:08:53,099 --> 00:08:55,795
Ted, why don't you just talk to him?
He's your best friend.

166
00:08:55,902 --> 00:08:57,028
That is I think.

167
00:08:58,538 --> 00:09:00,563
One of your best friends.

168
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:04,241
The point is, maybe it's time

just, "Good night.

Oh, God! I'll be right there.

334
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:39,123
Kevin, I'm so sorry. I have to go.
My friend's been stabbed with a sword.

335
00:17:39,758 --> 00:17:41,191
(SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)

336
00:17:43,362 --> 00:17:45,796
Klingon insult. You have no honor.

337
00:17:46,265 --> 00:17:48,859
You know, if you felt this way,
you could have just been up front.

338
00:17:48,967 --> 00:17:51,800
No, I swear that was a real call. I just...

339
00:17:52,104 --> 00:17:53,571
Oh, forget it.

340
00:17:56,942 --> 00:18:01,470
I stabbed Lily. I stabbed my fianc?e.

341
00:18:02,681 --> 00:18:06,617
Come on, Marshall.
Do you really think she's still your fianc?e?

342
00:18:08,087 --> 00:18:09,486
I'm kidding.

343
00:18:10,389 --> 00:18:13,483
Hey, I think you guys
should have the apartment.

344
00:18:14,026 --> 00:18:16,494
But you fought so bravely for it.

345
00:18:16,595 --> 00:18:20,087
I wasn't fighting for the apartment.
I was fighting for...

346
00:18:20,199 --> 00:18:23,726
I don't know.
For everything to stay the way it is.

347
00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:26,597
But I'm not gonna get that, so...

348
00:18:26,705 --> 00:18:29,265
Seriously, take the place. It's yours.

349
00:18:29,374 --> 00:18:30,739
Is she okay?

350
00:18:30,843 --> 00:18:32,777
Well, they're just patching her up.
She's gonna be fine.

351
00:18:32,878 --> 00:18:35,938
So, get this.
I was on a date with this girl Jackie.

352
00:18:36,982 --> 00:18:40,679
What? You said she's fine. So, anyway,
I was on a date with this girl Jackie.

353
00:18:41,186 --> 00:18:44,349
Wow, Jackie.
You make a really great first impression.

354
00:18:44,456 --> 00:18:49,325
I have a feeling that tonight
you might end up being Jackie... oh.

355
00:18:51,897 --> 00:18:55,526
Yeah, I'm sorry.
I'm gonna have to lemon-law you.

356
00:18:57,069 --> 00:19:00,937
It's out there. It's a thing!
The lemon law is a thing!

357
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:03,007
Damn. I should've called it Barney's law.

358
00:19:03,108 --> 00:19:06,475
- But, you totally got...
- Just let him have this one.

359
00:19:07,846 --> 00:19:08,904
All set.

360
00:19:09,014 --> 00:19:13,144
She said she'd like to see the knights
of the poorly-constructed round table.

361
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:16,485
That's us.

362
00:19:18,423 --> 00:19:20,084
A sword fight?

363
00:19:20,792 --> 00:19:22,817
- Sorry, Lily.
- Sorry, Lily.

364
00:19:23,061 --> 00:19:26,030
On Monday, I'm gonna have to tell
my kindergarten class,

365
00:19:26,131 --> 00:19:28,429
who I teach not to run with scissors,

366
00:19:28,534 --> 00:19:32,300
that my fianc? ran me through
with a fricking broadsword!

367
00:19:33,338 --> 00:19:36,865
Well, just to be fair,
it didn't go all the way through.

368
00:19:37,209 --> 00:19:41,976
I'm sorry. Is this a discussion of the degree
to which you stabbed me?

369
00:19:43,448 --> 00:19:45,712
You're right. I'm sorry.

370
00:19:46,485 --> 00:19:50,387
We were fighting to see
who gets the apartment. And I won.

371
00:19:50,489 --> 00:19:53,322
You didn't win. I gave it to you.

372
00:19:53,425 --> 00:19:55,450
- You know what, if I had tried...
- Okay, wait, wait, wait!

373
00:19:55,561 --> 00:19:59,088
I don't want that apartment!
It's a boy apartment.

374
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:05,159
It's full of swords and video games
and kind of smells like dude.

375
00:20:08,173 --> 00:20:11,404
I mean, it's fine for now,
but when we get married,

376
00:20:11,810 --> 00:20:14,244
I wanna start a new life with you.

377
00:20:14,546 --> 00:20:16,070
In a new place.

378
00:20:17,816 --> 00:20:21,343
- Gonna miss the old place.
- I will, too.

379
00:20:22,688 --> 00:20:24,883
We're not getting married for, like, a year.

380
00:20:24,990 --> 00:20:26,981
Yeah, that's Future Marshall's problem.

381
00:20:27,092 --> 00:20:29,583
- Let that guy deal with it.
- Totally.

382
00:20:30,429 --> 00:20:34,160
Maybe it's the massive blood loss talking,
but I'm starving.

383
00:20:34,833 --> 00:20:38,291
- Let's go get some dinner.
- I know just the place.

384
00:20:39,838 --> 00:20:41,135
A Chinese restaurant.

385
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:43,834
- I still don't believe it.
- I told you.

386
00:20:44,042 --> 00:20:45,532
Okay, a toast.

387
00:20:46,378 --> 00:20:48,505
Life is full of changes.

388
00:20:48,981 --> 00:20:53,111
One day you have an apartment,
the next day it's a House of Dumplings.

389
00:20:53,218 --> 00:20:56,779
But the important stuff doesn't change.
To the important stuff.

390
00:20:56,888 --> 00:20:57,946
- Here, here.
- Cheers.

391
00:20:58,056 --> 00:20:59,853
- Well said.
- Cheers.

392
00:20:59,958 --> 00:21:01,585
To the lemon law.

393
00:21:03,362 --> 00:21:04,727
Self click.

394
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:09,223
And, by the way, I bought these glasses.
Bought them at Ikea.

395
00:21:09,401 --> 00:21:11,164
These are my glasses!

396
00:21:11,803 --> 00:21:14,601
I love this song.
I haven't heard this in forever.

397
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:17,868
I'm pretty sure this is a mix tape
you made me in sophomore year.

398
00:21:17,976 --> 00:21:19,466
Yeah, right.

399
00:21:19,578 --> 00:21:23,036
Lily, your apartment makes
the best Shanghai dumplings.

400
00:21:24,082 --> 00:21:27,142
<i>MARSHALL ON SPEAKER; I love you, Lily,</i>
<i>Happy Valentine's Day, 1998,</i>
