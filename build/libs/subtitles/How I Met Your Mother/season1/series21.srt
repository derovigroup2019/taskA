<i>Her favorite singer was Otis Redding,</i>
<i>And she wanted two kids, a boy and a girl,</i>

167
00:08:18,731 --> 00:08:20,790
All right, fine. Set it up.

168
00:08:22,168 --> 00:08:25,296
You wanted to see me,
so I guess that means we're talking again.

169
00:08:25,404 --> 00:08:29,204
Will you taste this latte for me?
I think they gave me decaf.

170
00:08:33,246 --> 00:08:34,440
It tastes normal to me.

171
00:08:34,547 --> 00:08:37,607
That's what I thought, too.
Then I got this e-mail from Butterfield.

172
00:08:37,717 --> 00:08:41,346
- Oh, God!
- It got me as well.

173
00:08:41,654 --> 00:08:44,145
Well, then why did you have me drink it?

174
00:08:44,257 --> 00:08:47,055
Because now you're in.

175
00:08:48,261 --> 00:08:49,694
Okay.

176
00:08:49,795 --> 00:08:51,422
Don't think I'm overlooking
the obvious fact

177
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:53,795
that I should just be mad at you.

178
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:58,166
But Executive Mischief Consultant
Marshall Eriksen reporting for duty.

179
00:08:58,938 --> 00:09:01,065
Let's make that bastard pay.

180
00:09:01,574 --> 00:09:03,064
You think that
we should brush our teeth first?

181
00:09:03,175 --> 00:09:05,370
- Yeah, it's probably a good idea.
- Let's go.

182
00:09:06,178 --> 00:09:09,272
<i>OLDER TED; So, that night I had</i>
<i>a blind date with my perfect match,</i>

183
00:09:09,382 --> 00:09:11,373
<i>I was so excited, I got there early,</i>

184
00:09:11,484 --> 00:09:12,951
<i>But before it even started,,,</i>

185
00:09:13,052 --> 00:09:14,485
(PHONE RINGING)

186
00:09:16,022 --> 00:09:17,114
Lily?

187
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:18,713
Hey, Ted, are you busy?

188
00:09:19,158 --> 00:09:20,955
Um, yes.

189
00:09:21,661 --> 00:09:23,686
Oh, right. Soul mate. Forgot.

190
00:09:23,796 --> 00:09:26,094
Listen, could you take
a cab out to Dutchess County

191
00:09:26,198 --> 00:09:28,223
and change a flat on Marshall's Fiero?

192
00:09:28,334 --> 00:09:29,358
<i>What?</i>

193
00:09:29,769 --> 00:09:32,363
What? No. Can't you just call Marshall?

194
00:09:33,105 --> 00:09:35,096
Marshall can't know about this.

195
00:09:35,207 --> 00:09:38,301
Look, Ted, it's dark,
I don't know how to change a tire,

196
00:09:38,411 --> 00:09:42,472
and I've stumbled into the beginning
of a very scary campfire story.

197
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:45,016
- Can you please hurry?
- I can't. I'm waiting...

198
00:09:45,117 --> 00:09:48,575
Oh, my God,
is that a drifter with a hook for a hand?

199
00:09:48,688 --> 00:09:50,485
No, drifter, no!

200
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:53,525
- Come on, Lily.
- But you see my point.

201
00:09:54,961 --> 00:09:57,555
All right, stay there. I'm on my way.

202
00:10:03,069 --> 00:10:08,006
<i>OLDER TED; And so, one $90 cab ride later,</i>
<i>I was in the middle of nowhere,</i>

203
00:10:10,309 --> 00:10:13,278
Oh, thank God. I'm so sorry about this.

204
00:10:13,379 --> 00:10:15,210
- Did you get ahold of your date?
- Yes.

205
00:10:15,314 --> 00:10:18,681
- And was she okay about pushing it back?
- Yes. Because she's perfect!

206
00:10:18,784 --> 00:10:20,274
So, what am I doing here?

207
00:10:20,386 --> 00:10:22,445
- You can never tell Marshall.
- I won't.

208
00:10:22,555 --> 00:10:26,389
Ever. Swear. Swear on the lives
of your unborn boy and girl.

209
00:10:26,492 --> 00:10:28,483
I swear on Luke and Leia.

210
00:10:30,162 --> 00:10:33,154
About a month ago,
I started getting insomnia.

211
00:10:34,133 --> 00:10:37,660
<i>LIL Y; Marrying Marshall had been</i>
<i>all I wanted for a long time,</i>

212
00:10:38,037 --> 00:10:41,734
<i>But now that it was really happening,</i>
<i>it seemed kind of huge and scary,</i>

213
00:10:41,841 --> 00:10:44,810
<i>TED; Did you talk to Marshall about it?</i>
<i>LIL Y; He wouldn't have understood,</i>

214
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:47,572
<i>He's not exactly nervous</i>
<i>about tying the knot,</i>

215
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:48,806
(SNORING)

216
00:10:51,951 --> 00:10:55,182
<i>So I spent my nights reading, painting,</i>

217
00:10:55,287 --> 00:10:57,414
<i>setting the high score</i>
<i>on Super Bomberman,</i>

218
00:10:57,523 --> 00:10:59,514
<i>- TED; That was you? Awesome!</i>
<i>- I know!</i>

219
00:10:59,625 --> 00:11:03,152
<i>I just got in the zone and,,,</i>
<i>Not the point of the story,</i>

220
00:11:03,763 --> 00:11:05,628
<i>And then I started thinking about Victoria</i>

221
00:11:05,731 --> 00:11:07,995
<i>and how she followed</i>
<i>her dream to Germany,</i>

222
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:09,795
<i>then I found this art fellowship,</i>

223
00:11:10,269 --> 00:11:14,399
- Let me guess. It's somewhere far away.
- San Francisco.

224
00:11:15,541 --> 00:11:20,035
But it's not like I'm going to do it.
The dates conflict with the wedding.

225
00:11:20,346 --> 00:11:25,716
But I love painting,
and I've always wondered if I'm any good.

226
00:11:26,752 --> 00:11:28,583
This was the way to find out.

227
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:31,623
- And the interview is tonight.
- In New Haven.

228
00:11:37,263 --> 00:11:39,163
You don't want to get married.

229
00:11:39,265 --> 00:11:41,597
Of course I want to get married!

230
00:11:41,734 --> 00:11:45,101
I... It's not like I was ever going to do it.

231
00:11:45,237 --> 00:11:49,071
I just... I just really wanted to see
if I could get this.

232
00:11:49,775 --> 00:11:53,609
Lily, we live in the center
of art and culture in America.

233
00:11:53,713 --> 00:11:56,113
I'm sure you could find a program here
that's just as selective.

234
00:11:56,215 --> 00:11:58,513
But you chose one
in a city 3,000 miles away,

235
00:11:58,617 --> 00:12:00,517
and you didn't tell Marshall.

236
00:12:00,619 --> 00:12:03,452
I think it's pretty clear what that means.

237
00:12:05,024 --> 00:12:06,514
Okay, I...

238
00:12:07,159 --> 00:12:09,354
I was having second thoughts.

239
00:12:10,262 --> 00:12:12,287
But I'm not anymore.

240
00:12:12,631 --> 00:12:17,591
I... I mean, this flat tire was a sign.
I'm not supposed to do this.

241
00:12:17,703 --> 00:12:20,934
I'm supposed to go home
and be with Marshall.

242
00:12:22,908 --> 00:12:26,639
- You must think I'm so stupid.
- I don't think you're stupid.

243
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:29,647
- I love Marshall.
- I know you do. Come here.

244
00:12:33,018 --> 00:12:34,417
It's okay.

245
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:38,650
Look, marriage is big.
You're allowed to freak out.

246
00:12:38,991 --> 00:12:41,016
But why am I the only one?

247
00:12:41,227 --> 00:12:43,787
How come Marshall isn't doing
anything crazy?

248
00:12:43,963 --> 00:12:47,296
So all we need is one large shipping box
and 100 white mice.

249
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:52,332
All done.

250
00:12:55,174 --> 00:12:57,267
Ted, let's go to New Haven.

251
00:12:57,510 --> 00:12:59,842
Lily, don't do this to yourself.

252
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:02,406
I just need to know if I can get in.

253
00:13:02,515 --> 00:13:05,507
If I do this interview,
and get into the program, then I'll know,

254
00:13:05,618 --> 00:13:07,984
and I can forget all about it,
and get married.

255
00:13:08,087 --> 00:13:09,486
Come on! It's an adventure.

256
00:13:09,588 --> 00:13:12,216
No, it's not an adventure. It's a mistake.

257
00:13:12,324 --> 00:13:15,816
Okay, yes, it's a mistake.
I know it's a mistake.

258
00:13:15,928 --> 00:13:18,954
But there are certain things in life
where you know it's a mistake,

259
00:13:19,064 --> 00:13:20,622
but you don't really know it's a mistake,

260
00:13:20,733 --> 00:13:23,668
because the only way to really know
it's a mistake is to make the mistake,

261
00:13:23,769 --> 00:13:26,101
and look back and say,
"Yep, that was a mistake."

262
00:13:26,205 --> 00:13:29,470
So, really, the bigger mistake would be
to not make the mistake

263
00:13:29,575 --> 00:13:31,475
because then you'd go your whole life
not really knowing

264
00:13:31,577 --> 00:13:33,204
if something is a mistake or not.

265
00:13:33,312 --> 00:13:35,371
And, damn it, I've made no mistakes!

266
00:13:35,481 --> 00:13:36,812
I've done all of this,

267
00:13:36,916 --> 00:13:41,148
my life, my relationship,
my career, mistake-free.

268
00:13:42,087 --> 00:13:44,351
Does any of this make sense to you?

269
00:13:44,456 --> 00:13:47,118
I don't know. You said "mistake" a lot.

270
00:13:47,226 --> 00:13:48,921
Lily, don't do this.

271
00:13:49,028 --> 00:13:51,462
Ted, I'm getting married in two months,

272
00:13:51,564 --> 00:13:53,691
and I'm freaking out,
and you're my best friend,

273
00:13:53,799 --> 00:13:56,859
- and you just have to forgive me for this.
- But forgive you for what?

274
00:13:56,969 --> 00:13:59,096
Lily. Lily!

275
00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:06,601
Hey, Lily, this is Ted,

276
00:14:06,712 --> 00:14:09,340
the guy you left stranded
by the side of the road.

277
00:14:09,448 --> 00:14:11,575
Just wanted to say good luck
with the interview.

278
00:14:11,684 --> 00:14:13,083
Remember to pick up some milk.

279
00:14:13,185 --> 00:14:16,586
Oh, and when I get home,
I'm going to kill you.

280
00:14:17,656 --> 00:14:20,352
And, also, I texted you the same thing.

281
00:14:27,933 --> 00:14:29,230
Hey, I need a big favor.

282
00:14:29,335 --> 00:14:30,359
Anything, bro.

283
00:14:30,469 --> 00:14:32,528
I need you to come up to Dutchess County
and pick me up.

284
00:14:32,638 --> 00:14:33,798
No.

285
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:38,305
- It's kind of an emergency.
- What are you doing in Dutchess County?

286
00:14:38,410 --> 00:14:40,708
Apple picking. Can you just get up here?

287
00:14:41,247 --> 00:14:43,408
I wish I could help, buddy,
but I'm stuck here at work.

288
00:14:43,515 --> 00:14:45,107
We're kind of swamped.

289
00:14:45,217 --> 00:14:48,084
- Hey, is that Ted?
- Yeah. He's stuck in Dutchess County.

290
00:14:48,187 --> 00:14:49,654
Don't you have a big date tonight?

291
00:14:49,755 --> 00:14:52,349
(STAMMERING) Marshall. Hi. Yes. Yes, I do.

292
00:14:52,524 --> 00:14:54,458
So what are you doing
in Dutchess County?

293
00:14:55,361 --> 00:14:59,297
Can't a brother go apple picking
without getting the third degree? Damn!

294
00:14:59,498 --> 00:15:01,329
Okay, well, hang on.
I'm coming to get you.

295
00:15:01,533 --> 00:15:03,933
- No!
- Relax, man. I'll take the Fiero.

296
00:15:04,036 --> 00:15:06,266
No, no, no. Just forget it.

297
00:15:07,206 --> 00:15:09,333
A little prank. I'm not in Dutchess County.

298
00:15:10,309 --> 00:15:12,675
So, that's the prank?
That you're not in Dutchess County?

299
00:15:13,379 --> 00:15:17,509
Yep. Gotcha! Classic! Gotta go.

300
00:15:20,619 --> 00:15:23,179
Hey, check it out.
This one actually looks like Butterfield.

301
00:15:23,289 --> 00:15:24,517
(GIGGLING)

302
00:15:26,125 --> 00:15:28,889
You know, over at the NRDC,
it's a bunch of really committed people

303
00:15:28,994 --> 00:15:32,760
who take their job of saving the Earth
very, very seriously.

304
00:15:32,865 --> 00:15:35,163
Which is great and everything, but

305
00:15:35,267 --> 00:15:38,361
I can't imagine having
this much fun over there.

306
00:15:38,470 --> 00:15:40,995
You're thinking about
coming to work here full-time?

307
00:15:41,106 --> 00:15:42,266
Maybe.

308
00:15:42,875 --> 00:15:44,570
- Don't tell Lily, okay?
- No.

309
00:15:44,677 --> 00:15:47,475
- Taking off for the night.
- Thanks, Tracy.

310
00:15:47,746 --> 00:15:51,307
Are you guys planning
on punching some holes in that box?

311
00:15:52,284 --> 00:15:53,911
Of course we are.

312
00:15:55,854 --> 00:15:57,014
- Were you going to think of that?
- No.

313
00:15:57,122 --> 00:15:58,714
- That would have been bad.
- Horrible.

314
00:15:59,758 --> 00:16:03,660
<i>OLDER TED; Luckily, there was still</i>
<i>one person I could call to get a ride home,</i>

315
00:16:04,096 --> 00:16:07,497
- Need a ride, cowboy?
- Sorry. I don't get in vans with strangers.

316
00:16:07,599 --> 00:16:11,365
- Too bad. I got candy.
- Candy?

317
00:16:14,039 --> 00:16:15,700
So, you're not going to tell me
what you were doing

318
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:17,742
by the side of a highway
in Dutchess County?

319
00:16:17,843 --> 00:16:20,744
- Nope. Sworn to secrecy.
- Oh, come on.

320
00:16:21,013 --> 00:16:23,174
- I like your hat.
- Right.

321
00:16:24,083 --> 00:16:26,608
This is embarrassing. I got highlights.

322
00:16:26,719 --> 00:16:29,882
Oh, for the waiting room
of your dental practice?

323
00:16:30,956 --> 00:16:34,323
<i>- Highlights</i> is a children's magazine.
- Yeah, I got it.

324
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:35,888
I thought it might look cool.

325
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:40,227
Of course, my colorist took "highlights"
to mean, "I want to look like a tiger,"

326
00:16:40,332 --> 00:16:43,392
- hence the hat.
- Oh. I gotta see this.

327
00:16:43,569 --> 00:16:46,561
- No way.
- Please. I bet it doesn't look that bad.

328
00:16:46,672 --> 00:16:48,503
I bet it looks great!

329
00:16:50,442 --> 00:16:54,845
"So," she says, changing the subject,
"Big date tonight."

330
00:16:55,481 --> 00:16:57,915
How does she rate
on the Mosby checklist?

331
00:16:58,017 --> 00:17:00,815
Kind of amazingly. She's 28, like me.

332
00:17:01,286 --> 00:17:02,878
Wow, I'm 28.

333
00:17:04,089 --> 00:17:07,024
College-educated, check.
Plays tennis, check.

334
00:17:07,126 --> 00:17:09,651
Favorite book
is <i>Love in the Time of Cholera,</i> check.

335
00:17:09,762 --> 00:17:13,858
I read that. More like,
"Love in the time of don't bothera."

You know, it's very rude
to wear a hat indoors. I'm just saying.

337
00:17:18,404 --> 00:17:21,805
- We're not indoors. We're in a van.
- Vans have doors. Let me see your hair.

338
00:17:21,907 --> 00:17:25,308
- Never. What else?
- She loves lasagna.

339
00:17:25,411 --> 00:17:28,403
- Barf.
- You know, I am sensing a pattern here.

340
00:17:29,148 --> 00:17:30,479
What else?

341
00:17:31,116 --> 00:17:33,949

343
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:38,314
And she's looking to get married
and have kids?

344
00:17:38,424 --> 00:17:41,120
Check and check.
She wants two kids, a boy and a girl.

345
00:17:41,226 --> 00:17:42,250
Wow.

346
00:17:43,128 --> 00:17:47,394
You know, I've been thinking about this.
I think I want to have zero kids.

347
00:17:47,499 --> 00:17:49,433
Really? You don't want kids?

348
00:17:49,535 --> 00:17:53,096
You know, Ted, not everyone
is as much of a woman as you.

349
00:17:54,706 --> 00:17:56,173
Hey. I'm driving.

350
00:18:00,913 --> 00:18:03,507
Look at that. 8:56. You're early.

351
00:18:04,016 --> 00:18:05,916
Hey, thanks for picking me up.

352
00:18:06,018 --> 00:18:10,148
Good luck on your date.
I hope she's everything you're looking for.

00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:12,384

I want you to go in there
with a smile on your face,

357
00:18:22,067 --> 00:18:23,694
so here's what I'm going to do.

358
00:18:23,802 --> 00:18:25,326
You're going to show me your hair?

359
00:18:25,437 --> 00:18:27,064
Actually, I was going
to show you my breasts,

360
00:18:27,172 --> 00:18:29,197
but, sure, we can do hair.

Barney's going to send out the package,

366
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:50,917
and Butterfield's going to be knee-deep
in angry white mice.

- Hi.
- Hey.

369
00:19:56,828 --> 00:20:00,457
So, Lil, did you get the milk?

370
00:20:02,434 --> 00:20:05,198
Yeah. Yeah, I got it.

371
00:20:05,971 --> 00:20:08,804
You think you might want
to drink the milk?

372
00:20:10,342 --> 00:20:13,038
No. Nope, I'm good.

373
00:20:14,179 --> 00:20:16,044
I don't need any milk.

374
00:20:19,084 --> 00:20:21,678
Look, guys, I know milk is important.

375
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:24,420
It's got vitamin A, vitamin D.

376
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:27,825
It's a great way to start the morning,
but Ted just had a huge date.

377
00:20:27,926 --> 00:20:30,918
- How'd it go, dude?
- I didn't go.

378

What? Why?

379
00:20:32,798 --> 00:20:35,494
I changed my mind.
I don't want to meet her.

380
00:20:35,601 --> 00:20:37,569
Why? She sounds perfect.

381
00:20:37,936 --> 00:20:41,394
I don't want perfect. I want Robin.

Oh, God, not this again.

383
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:47,310
- Ted, it's a mistake!
- Maybe.

But it's a mistake I have to make.

385
00:20:50,649 --> 00:20:53,174
Wrong. It's a mistake
you don't have to make.

386

Look at the evidence.
