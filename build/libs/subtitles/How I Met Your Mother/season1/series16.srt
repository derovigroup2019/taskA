00:08:32,745 --> 00:08:36,704
This is what happens when you,
you know, let them finish baking.

167
00:08:44,156 --> 00:08:45,418
I want you to stay.

168
00:08:50,429 --> 00:08:54,388
Everything here is dark and sketchy,
and seems illegal.

169
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:56,695
It's like shopping in Barney's mind.

170
00:08:56,802 --> 00:08:58,633
- Good luck, baby.
- Bye.

171
00:08:59,405 --> 00:09:02,374
Now, what sort of dress
did you have in mind, dear?

172
00:09:02,475 --> 00:09:06,309
Nothing too huge or poofy.
I'm not really a girly girl.

173
00:09:06,412 --> 00:09:08,937
But I would like to look
like a beautiful princess.

174
00:09:09,048 --> 00:09:12,108
- I saw a couple up front that were nice.
- By the window?

175
00:09:12,752 --> 00:09:16,711
No offense, dear, but those are
a little out of your price range.

176
00:09:18,257 --> 00:09:19,622
Where does she get off?

177
00:09:19,725 --> 00:09:21,352
She doesn't know
how much money I make.

178
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:22,825
These women are experts.

179
00:09:22,929 --> 00:09:25,659
They can guess your net annual income
just by looking at your underwear.

180
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:30,093
Damn you, Old Navy
and your reasonably-priced three-packs.

181
00:09:30,803 --> 00:09:33,772
- Well, at least we get free champagne.
- And cake.

182
00:09:33,873 --> 00:09:35,397
Speaking of which, Victoria,

183
00:09:35,508 --> 00:09:39,035
have you decided what to do
about your donut fellowship?

184
00:09:39,145 --> 00:09:43,172
You know, I don't know. I mean,
I want to go, but I don't want to lose Ted.

185
00:09:43,282 --> 00:09:46,080
I even thought about long-distance,
as if that ever works.

186
00:09:46,185 --> 00:09:48,551
All talking and no sex. Kill me now.

187
00:09:49,722 --> 00:09:53,488
I know it sounds lame, but I actually think
that Ted might be the one.

188
00:09:54,694 --> 00:09:57,663
- That's pretty hard to walk away from.
- Well, I don't know.

189
00:09:57,763 --> 00:10:00,664
I'd feel a little Stepford
turning down a huge opportunity

190
00:10:00,766 --> 00:10:02,927
to chase some guy
I'd only known two months.

191
00:10:03,035 --> 00:10:07,870
But this isn't just some guy. This is Ted.
He's amazing.

192
00:10:07,974 --> 00:10:12,434
- He's the best guy I know.
- Yeah, in America. But German guys?

193
00:10:12,878 --> 00:10:16,575
I would let them bread my schnitzel
any day, if you know what I mean.

194
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:19,347
- I really don't.
- Sex.

195
00:10:20,953 --> 00:10:24,013
Excuse me, ma'am.
This bastard's kicked. Thanks.

That's okay, guys, I hate it.

198
00:10:30,029 --> 00:10:32,156
- Just horrible.
- It's bad. It's really bad.

199
00:10:32,264 --> 00:10:36,030
Short in the front, long in the back.
That is the mullet of wedding dresses.

200
00:10:37,803 --> 00:10:40,601
You know, Victoria,
Marshall and I did long-distance once.

201
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:45,834
In college, I did an art course in Paris.
I was the only American there.

202
00:10:46,545 --> 00:10:50,675
I was really Ionely.
I only had one friend. Gabrielle.

203
00:10:50,783 --> 00:10:53,251
And she was kind of homely
and strange-Iooking.

204
00:10:53,352 --> 00:10:57,186
And she was really self-conscious
about this little moustache she had.

205
00:10:57,289 --> 00:11:00,588
Anyway, halfway through the semester,
she just stopped talking to me,

206
00:11:00,693 --> 00:11:02,058
and I never figured out why.

207
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:05,062
And then I had nobody.

208
00:11:05,631 --> 00:11:07,360
The only thing that got me through was

209
00:11:07,466 --> 00:11:10,094
knowing that my soul mate
was back at home waiting for me.

210
00:11:11,203 --> 00:11:15,435
If Ted's your soul mate,
then it may be worth it to hang on to him.

211
00:11:15,541 --> 00:11:18,772
But how am I supposed to know
if we're soul mates? It's too soon.

- Hello?
- Hey, random question.

- How do you feel about cats?
- Cats. Hated the musical, love the animal.

216

- A cat person. Why am I not surprised?
- Stop it.

217
00:11:31,857 --> 00:11:35,156
Bye. Why does Ted want to know
if I like cats?

218
00:11:35,261 --> 00:11:36,728
Maybe he's gonna buy you one.

219
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:39,794
I did hear barking in the background.

220
00:11:39,899 --> 00:11:43,426
Maybe he was in a pet store.
Does he want us to get a cat together?

221
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:47,165
Maybe he's using an adorable kitty
to guilt you into staying.

222
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:51,307
That is low.
Do you really think that's what he's doing?

You know what?
We're doing this all wrong.

228
00:12:07,626 --> 00:12:11,790
I'm gonna get you one of those
front-window dresses. Just for fun.

229
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:16,861
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

230
00:12:17,436 --> 00:12:21,839
Okay. Just kind of seems like you're trying
to hustle Victoria out of the country.

231
00:12:21,941 --> 00:12:24,136
I'm not. I'm just trying to support her.

232
00:12:24,243 --> 00:12:27,178
She got a super-important
dessert scholarship.

234
00:12:28,748 --> 00:12:31,512
It is a super-important
dessert scholarship.

Wow, that's hard to say
without sounding sarcastic.

Look, I know you're not
Victoria's biggest fan,

but she seems to make Ted happy.

238

So think about that before you use
your miles to buy her a plane ticket.

on my wedding night.

- Look how happy she is.
- Yeah.

243
00:13:00,045 --> 00:13:03,537
You know, I've always thought of myself
as one of those independent women

who would never let any guy
mess with my career,

245
00:13:06,352 --> 00:13:08,752

I feel guilty.
Like it's un-feminist or something.

- I know what you mean.
- You do?

248

Well, I'm always putting my career
ahead of my relationships

of Ionely nights in that job description.

See, that's what I'm afraid of.

doesn't make you un-feminist.

that you guys would be happy together.

lose your leg tomorrow,

would you sit on the couch

- You know it.

or we can run and do awesome air kicks
before our leg gets chopped off.

322

- Wait, so we're sharing the leg?
- No, the leg is a metaphor.

How could the leg be well enough
to do awesome air kicks one day

and yet still so sick
it needs to be chopped off the next?

00:18:14,827 --> 00:18:16,226
Let's do all the stuff we talked about doing

329
00:18:16,328 --> 00:18:18,125
- and never got around to.
- Like go to the Met?

330
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:19,788
Yeah, we'll walk across
the Brooklyn Bridge.

331
00:18:19,898 --> 00:18:21,593
See some monkeys at the zoo.

332
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:24,168
Go to that French-Vietnamese place
we keep passing and say we want to try.

333
00:18:24,269 --> 00:18:26,999
- Wow. We better get going.
- Yeah.

334
00:18:27,806 --> 00:18:29,171
- Big day.
- Yeah.

335
00:18:29,274 --> 00:18:32,801
<i>OLDER TED; And kids, that's exactly</i>
<i>what we did with our last day,</i>

336
00:18:32,911 --> 00:18:36,347
<i>The museum, The bridge, The restaurant,</i>

337
00:18:36,782 --> 00:18:38,977
<i>And all of those nice things,</i>

338
00:18:39,685 --> 00:18:42,586
Lily, you have to tell him.
That dress cost a fortune.

339
00:18:42,688 --> 00:18:45,885
No. I am just gonna wait for
the next time Marshall really screws up

340
00:18:45,991 --> 00:18:49,427
and then I'll just slip this in,
and it won't seem so bad by comparison.

341
00:18:49,528 --> 00:18:53,897
- Well, here's hoping he cheats on you.
- Yeah, but only like second base.

342
00:18:56,135 --> 00:19:00,003
Look at us. Two guys in suits.
You feel that slight tingle?

343
00:19:00,405 --> 00:19:04,466
That's every girl in the bar wanting you,
and every guy wanting to be you.

344
00:19:05,611 --> 00:19:07,636
Actually, it's mostly me,
but you're getting some of the splash.

345
00:19:09,781 --> 00:19:10,873
(GRUNTS)

346
00:19:11,083 --> 00:19:15,349
Hey, babe. Dollar beer night.
So I splurged and got us each our own.

347
00:19:16,088 --> 00:19:19,148
So, have you thought any more
about coming to work for Barney Corp?

348
00:19:19,258 --> 00:19:21,852
Oh, please.
Your company is not called Barney Corp.

349
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:23,052
Yet.

350
00:19:23,929 --> 00:19:26,727
I almost forgot. Sergei sent me your bill.

351
00:19:30,302 --> 00:19:32,167
Barney, this says $4,000.

352
00:19:32,271 --> 00:19:34,739
I thought you said
that it was one-third price!

353
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,501
Must be a $12,000 dollar suit.

354
00:19:36,608 --> 00:19:38,132
Oh, well, guess you'll have
to come work at my company.

355
00:19:39,645 --> 00:19:42,614
You set this up.
You set this whole thing up.

356
00:19:42,714 --> 00:19:45,205
I most certainly did!

357
00:19:46,919 --> 00:19:48,614
Well, it won't work.

358
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:52,019
Even if I have to get two extra night jobs,
I'll pay your precious tailor.

359
00:19:52,124 --> 00:19:54,058
I'm not selling my soul.

360
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:57,051
Baby, I know that
this will make things harder,

361
00:19:57,162 --> 00:19:59,187
but I will make it work. I promise.

362
00:19:59,298 --> 00:20:01,789
I destroyed an $8,000 wedding dress.

363
00:20:04,236 --> 00:20:06,170
- What time is the interview?
- 9:00 a.m.

364
00:20:06,271 --> 00:20:08,762
And you'll need new shoes. Don't worry.
I know a guy.

365
00:20:13,712 --> 00:20:16,510
Well, I'm glad we got to spend the day
doing awesome air kicks.

366
00:20:16,615 --> 00:20:19,516
Yeah. I was almost too tired
for all the sex.

367
00:20:23,488 --> 00:20:26,889
- I'm gonna miss you so much.
- I'm gonna miss you, too.

368
00:20:34,032 --> 00:20:38,526
Hey, you know. I mean, if when I get back,
we're still single we can...

369
00:20:38,637 --> 00:20:39,865
Even if we're not.

370
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:43,708
Okay.

371
00:21:00,792 --> 00:21:04,853
Look, I know it never works for anyone,
but do you wanna try long-distance?

372
00:21:04,963 --> 00:21:06,692
Yes. Yes.

373
00:21:10,535 --> 00:21:12,867
- We can beat the odds.
- Odds, schmodds.

374
00:21:12,971 --> 00:21:16,304
It's gonna work.
We're gonna make it work. It'll work.

375
00:21:18,143 --> 00:21:19,576
<i>OLDER TED; It didn't work,</i>

376
00:21:19,678 --> 00:21:22,306
<i>Long-distance was and is a terrible idea,</i>

377
00:21:23,248 --> 00:21:26,649
<i>A really terrible idea, Just awful,</i>

378
00:21:27,519 --> 00:21:29,419
<i>But more on that later,</i>
