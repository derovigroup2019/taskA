OLDER TED: Kids,
before I met your mother,

1
00:00:17,117 --> 00:00:20,518
when I was still out there searching,
I learned something valuable.

2
00:00:20,620 --> 00:00:22,281
That love is not a science.

3
00:00:22,389 --> 00:00:24,949
- Wow, that was a great story, Dad.
- SON: We're gonna go watch TV.

OLDER TED: You see, sometimes in life

5
00:00:27,527 --> 00:00:30,155
you just have to accept
that certain things can't be explained,

6
00:00:30,263 --> 00:00:32,128
and that's kind of scary.

7
00:00:33,967 --> 00:00:36,231
- Oh, my God.
- I know, I'm still shaking.

8
00:00:36,336 --> 00:00:38,770

9

10
00:00:40,607 --> 00:00:42,268
Another round,
and back it up for me and Lily!

11
00:00:42,375 --> 00:00:43,501
What happened?

12
00:00:43,610 --> 00:00:47,944
- We saw something, up in the apartment.
- Something bad.

What was it?

19
00:01:10,236 --> 00:01:13,433
Only the craziest, meanest-Iooking mouse
you've ever seen.

20
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:18,341
Mouse? Sweetie, that wasn't a mouse.
That was a huge cockroach.

21
00:01:18,445 --> 00:01:20,913
Baby, it was a mouse. It had whiskers.

22
00:01:21,014 --> 00:01:24,040
What, those things coming out
of his head? Those were antennae.

23
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:27,779
- Marshall ran away from a cockroach.
- It was a mouse.

24
00:01:27,887 --> 00:01:30,151
Oh, yeah, sorry, my bad. You're a man.

25
00:01:30,790 --> 00:01:34,385

All I have to do is input
the variables, run the algorithm,

32

and presto manifesto,
you have a soul mate and it works!

33

- Yes.
- We're signing up.

00:02:14,868 --> 00:02:17,666
- What?
- Ted, these chicks are desperate and hot.

42
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:21,228
That's a perfect cocktail.
Shake well, then sleep with.

43
00:02:22,208 --> 00:02:25,336
I'm not going to a matchmaker.
That's like giving up.

44
00:02:25,445 --> 00:02:27,709
It's the man version of getting a cat.

45
00:02:27,847 --> 00:02:31,715
No, it wasn't a cockroach. It had fur.
And only mammals have fur.

46
00:02:31,818 --> 00:02:32,910
It was a cockroach.

47
00:02:33,019 --> 00:02:35,283
Come on, Lily.
The only way that that was a cockroach

48
00:02:35,388 --> 00:02:38,516
is if it was wearing the skin
of a mouse it just killed.

49
00:02:39,626 --> 00:02:41,491

- What?
- My boat is sinking!

55
00:02:59,145 --> 00:03:00,612
- You have a boat?
- Yes, I bought a boat last year

56
00:03:00,713 --> 00:03:03,204
at a police auction. I just got a call
from a guy down at the marina

57
00:03:03,316 --> 00:03:04,783
that it's leaning starboard
at a 45-degree angle.

58
00:03:04,884 --> 00:03:07,546
If I don't get down there right now
it's gonna capsize! Now come on!

Your boat is sinking. That was good.

60
00:03:12,926 --> 00:03:15,918
Come on.
Ted, this is an incredible opportunity.

61
00:03:16,029 --> 00:03:19,988
We'll meet our soul mates, nail them,
and never call them again.

62
00:03:21,668 --> 00:03:23,568
All finished, gentlemen?

63
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:26,764
Congratulations, you have just taken
your very first step.

64
00:03:26,873 --> 00:03:29,842
Gosh, thanks, Ellen.
I sure hope this works.

65
00:03:30,076 --> 00:03:34,775
I'm so done with the single life.
All the games, the meaningless sex.

66
00:03:35,081 --> 00:03:36,810
You deserve more.

67
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:39,716
That is so true, Ellen.

68
00:03:40,286 --> 00:03:44,484
I really think I'm ready to stop
being a me, and start being a we.

69
00:03:45,458 --> 00:03:48,222
Hey, is there any way I can
let it be known that I love cuddling?

70
00:03:48,328 --> 00:03:51,889
Oh, of course you... That is so...

71
00:03:54,867 --> 00:03:57,495
It's kind of hard to talk about
with Ted here,

72
00:03:57,604 --> 00:04:01,404
but I just want someone who's not afraid
to hold me at night,

73
00:04:02,642 --> 00:04:04,109
when the tears come.

74
00:04:05,712 --> 00:04:07,703
Ellen, can you help me find her?

75
00:04:08,281 --> 00:04:10,146
- Get out.
- What?

76
00:04:11,451 --> 00:04:13,783
I get 15 guys like you every week.

77
00:04:13,886 --> 00:04:16,047
Jerks who just wanna meet
vulnerable women,

78
00:04:16,155 --> 00:04:18,146
nail them, and never call them again.

79
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:20,317
Oh, my God, people do that?

80
00:04:20,426 --> 00:04:22,621
Do you wanna do this the easy way,
or the hard way?

81
00:04:22,729 --> 00:04:26,028
What's the hard way?
Security roughs me up and tosses me out?

82
00:04:26,132 --> 00:04:27,895
No, that's the easy way.

83
00:04:28,001 --> 00:04:31,095
The hard way is that I stomp the crap
out of you myself.

84
00:04:31,404 --> 00:04:33,838
- Okay, Ted, let's go.
- Not you. You stay.

85
00:04:35,942 --> 00:04:37,409
You're cute.

86
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:39,569
You're an architect. Good career.

87
00:04:40,113 --> 00:04:42,809
And you didn't use an obvious alias
on your application

88
00:04:42,915 --> 00:04:45,179
like your friend "Jack Package."

89
00:04:46,085 --> 00:04:48,645
- It's pronounced Puh-kaj.
- Get out of here!

90
00:04:50,256 --> 00:04:51,883
You, I can work with.

91
00:04:51,991 --> 00:04:56,792
You give me three days,
and I will find the woman you will marry.

92
00:04:58,197 --> 00:05:01,598
No, thanks.
I don't need an algorithm to meet women.

93
00:05:01,701 --> 00:05:04,966
It's New York City.
You know, plenty of fish in the sea.

94
00:05:05,071 --> 00:05:07,562
Plenty of fish in the sea.

95
00:05:07,674 --> 00:05:09,835
Yes, there's nine million people
in New York,

96
00:05:09,942 --> 00:05:12,001
4.5 million women.

97
00:05:12,111 --> 00:05:14,579
Of course, you wanna meet somebody
roughly your own age,

98
00:05:14,681 --> 00:05:16,706
let's say, plus-minus five years.

99
00:05:16,816 --> 00:05:19,307
So if we take into account
the most recent census data,

100
00:05:19,419 --> 00:05:22,354
that leaves us with 482,000.

101
00:05:22,455 --> 00:05:25,913
But wait, 48% of those
are already in relationships,

102
00:05:26,025 --> 00:05:28,892
and then you have to eliminate half
for intelligence, sense of humor

103
00:05:28,995 --> 00:05:30,053
and compatibility.

104
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:32,961
And then you have to take out
the ex-girlfriends, and the relatives

105
00:05:33,066 --> 00:05:35,125
and, oh, we can't forget those lesbians.

106
00:05:35,234 --> 00:05:39,933
And then that leaves us
with eight women.

107
00:05:41,641 --> 00:05:45,077
That can't be right. Eight? Really, eight?

108
00:05:46,112 --> 00:05:49,548
There are eight fish
in that big, blue ocean, Ted.

109
00:05:49,749 --> 00:05:52,809
And if you feel confident
that you could reel one into your boat

110
00:05:52,919 --> 00:05:54,716
without me, there's the door.

111
00:05:55,855 --> 00:05:57,413
Do you take credit cards?

112
00:06:00,226 --> 00:06:03,559
Okay, it's back.
And this time we got a good look.

113
00:06:03,696 --> 00:06:06,324
Hey. Seriously,
you have to stop doing that!

114
00:06:06,566 --> 00:06:09,364
It's bigger now. It's been feeding.

115
00:06:11,471 --> 00:06:13,666
We were just upstairs watching TV.

116
00:06:13,773 --> 00:06:15,240
Oh, gosh.

117
00:06:16,442 --> 00:06:17,409
(GASPS)

118
00:06:22,882 --> 00:06:25,350
Okay. Let's do this.

120

(SHUSHING)

121
00:06:36,262 --> 00:06:38,355
It's okay. It's over.

(EX CLAIMS)

123
00:06:49,575 --> 00:06:51,668
- So, did you get a good look at it?
- Yeah.

124
00:06:51,778 --> 00:06:56,010
It has six legs, a hard exoskeleton,
like a roach.

125
00:06:56,115 --> 00:06:58,777
But it had mouse-like characteristics.

126
00:06:58,885 --> 00:07:01,479
Gray-brown tufts of fur, a tail.

127
00:07:01,587 --> 00:07:04,385
So which is it, a cockroach or a mouse?

128
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:08,121
It's a cockamouse.

129
00:07:09,896 --> 00:07:11,090
What?

130
00:07:11,197 --> 00:07:14,098
It's some sort of mutant combination
of the two.

131
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:18,159
It's as if a cockroach and a mouse,
you know...

132
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:21,407
Did the horizontal, 10-legged,
inter-species cha-cha?

133
00:07:22,208 --> 00:07:24,699
That's impossible.
That simply can't happen.

134
00:07:25,111 --> 00:07:26,476
- But it can.
- And it has.

135
00:07:26,579 --> 00:07:27,944
And it's pissed.

136
00:07:30,483 --> 00:07:32,542
Dude, is everything okay?
You left the front door open.

137
00:07:32,652 --> 00:07:34,017
There was no time.

138
00:07:35,922 --> 00:07:39,050
So, Love Solutions?
Did you meet the love of your life?

139
00:07:39,158 --> 00:07:42,559
She said it'd take three days.
It's been five days.

140
00:07:42,662 --> 00:07:43,651
Should I be worried?

141
00:07:43,763 --> 00:07:46,231
Just play it cool. Don't Ted out about it.

142
00:07:47,233 --> 00:07:49,360
Did you just use my name as a verb?

143
00:07:50,036 --> 00:07:52,300
Yeah, we do that behind your back.

144
00:07:52,405 --> 00:07:54,202
Ted out. To overthink.

145
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:55,932
Also see, Ted up.

146
00:07:56,342 --> 00:07:59,209
Ted up, to overthink something
with disastrous results.

148
00:08:01,881 --> 00:08:03,644
Okay. I get it.

149
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:06,783
Don't worry. I'm not gonna
Ted anything up, or out.

150
00:08:07,687 --> 00:08:09,746
I should give it a few more days.

151
00:08:11,057 --> 00:08:14,891
- Hi, Ellen. Remember me? I'm Ted.
- Ted. Hi.

152
00:08:14,994 --> 00:08:16,427
I meant to call you.

153
00:08:16,529 --> 00:08:18,793
The computer is still crunching
the numbers.

154
00:08:18,898 --> 00:08:20,866
Busy as a bee, that little computer.

155
00:08:20,967 --> 00:08:22,525
You said it was gonna be three days.

156
00:08:22,635 --> 00:08:24,330
Did I? Three days.

157
00:08:24,437 --> 00:08:25,426
- Really?
- Yeah.

158
00:08:25,538 --> 00:08:28,530
When someone says you're gonna meet
the perfect woman in three days,

159
00:08:28,641 --> 00:08:31,132
you kind of put that in your datebook. So.

160
00:08:31,444 --> 00:08:34,675
How do I say this?
This is gonna be really hard.

161
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:39,375
Ted, there are absolutely no women
out there for you.

162
00:08:40,786 --> 00:08:43,186
Actually, I got through that okay.

163
00:08:47,827 --> 00:08:50,387
There are no women out there for me?
I thought you said there were eight.

164
00:08:50,496 --> 00:08:52,896
I know. There's supposed to be.
I don't know where they are.

165
00:08:52,999 --> 00:08:55,524
But I'm an architect.
And you said I'm cute.

166
00:08:55,635 --> 00:08:57,899
- I'm a cute architect.
- How do you think I feel?

167
00:08:58,004 --> 00:09:01,667
I have a 100% success rate.
That's my hook!

168
00:09:01,774 --> 00:09:04,174
I could maybe find somebody for you
if you were gay.

169
00:09:04,277 --> 00:09:05,801
- Well, I'm not.
- A little bi maybe?

170
00:09:05,912 --> 00:09:07,140
No!

171
00:09:08,247 --> 00:09:11,273
- You're messing with me, right?
- Come see for yourself.

172
00:09:12,218 --> 00:09:14,243
I cannot set you up

173
00:09:14,353 --> 00:09:18,187
unless you have a compatibility rating
of 7.0 or higher. And look.

174
00:09:18,491 --> 00:09:21,324
5.4, 4.8, 5.6...

175
00:09:21,427 --> 00:09:23,122
There's a 9.6 right there.

176
00:09:23,229 --> 00:09:24,924
Don't touch the computer.

177
00:09:26,499 --> 00:09:29,434
Yes. Sarah O'Brien.
I fixed her up six months ago.

178
00:09:29,535 --> 00:09:31,935
She would've been
absolutely perfect for you.

179
00:09:32,038 --> 00:09:35,098
Well, what about the guy you set her
up with? Is he a 9.6 compatibility rating?

180
00:09:35,207 --> 00:09:37,072
- 8.5.
- So he sucks!

181
00:09:37,176 --> 00:09:40,577
No, 8.5 is an extremely good
match-up quotient.

182
00:09:41,213 --> 00:09:45,240
Sure it's good. It's solid. But a 9.6?

183
00:09:45,351 --> 00:09:49,117
9.6 is off the charts.
But Sarah is matched up.

184
00:09:49,822 --> 00:09:53,087
Ted, look. I have lunch. Please.

185
00:09:53,326 --> 00:09:56,386
I promise we will find you somebody.
Don't lose hope.

186
00:09:56,896 --> 00:09:59,421
There are new women turning 18
every day.

187
00:10:27,927 --> 00:10:31,090
It's a whole new species. The cockamouse.

188
00:10:31,197 --> 00:10:34,633
And it's the size of a potato.

189
00:10:36,469 --> 00:10:40,200
So, what now, it's a cockapotatomouse?

190
00:10:40,339 --> 00:10:43,137
Don't make it sound ridiculous.
It's a cockamouse!

191
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:47,279
My God, this is incredible!
We're like the same person.

192
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:50,975
Sarah O'Brien loves brunch.
She wants to have two children.

193
00:10:51,083 --> 00:10:54,416
Her guilty-pleasure song
is <i>Summer Breeze</i> by Seals and Croft.

194
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:57,546
Wow, Ted.
Sounds like you're her perfect woman.

195
00:10:58,524 --> 00:11:01,687
And like the majestic seahorse,
it's hermaphroditic.

196
00:11:02,795 --> 00:11:06,060
Obviously, the whole thing
is shrouded in mystery.

197
00:11:06,499 --> 00:11:08,831
For as much as we know
about the cockamouse,

198
00:11:08,934 --> 00:11:11,164
there is still so much we don't know.

199
00:11:11,871 --> 00:11:15,034
Well, we know that there is no such thing
as the cockamouse.

200
00:11:15,141 --> 00:11:18,133
What we don't know
is what you guys have been smoking.

201
00:11:19,111 --> 00:11:21,272
So you really don't believe
in the cockamouse?

202
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:24,178
Well, I believe that you saw
something perfectly normal,

203
00:11:24,283 --> 00:11:28,413
but you've exaggerated it in your mind,
you know, like the Loch Ness monster.

204
00:11:31,323 --> 00:11:35,817
If by "like the Loch Ness monster"
you mean "totally exists and is awesome,"

205
00:11:35,928 --> 00:11:38,419
then, yeah, it's like
the Loch Ness monster.

206
00:11:39,432 --> 00:11:42,560
Its diet is not unlike our own.
Grains, cereals,

207
00:11:42,668 --> 00:11:45,466
- and it's awfully fond of cheese.
- Okay. This is getting weird.

208
00:11:45,571 --> 00:11:47,038
The similarities go on and on.

209
00:11:47,139 --> 00:11:50,370
She hates phonies.
I totally hate phonies, too.

210
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:53,037
She's a dermatologist. I have skin.

211
00:11:53,779 --> 00:11:56,646
You want to be her boyfriend.
She already has a boyfriend.

212
00:11:56,749 --> 00:11:59,377
- It's uncanny.
- All right.

213
00:11:59,685 --> 00:12:01,152
But it wouldn't hurt
to check her out, right?

214
00:12:01,253 --> 00:12:05,087
See what my 9.6 looks like in person,
as, you know, a frame of reference.

215
00:12:05,191 --> 00:12:09,287
And if she thinks she can do
11.45% better, who am I to deny her that?

- Hi, I'm Dr. O'Brien.

I'm architect Mosby. Sorry.
I just wanted to say my job, too.

219
00:12:22,641 --> 00:12:24,472
- Hi, I'm Ted.
- Hi.

220
00:12:24,610 --> 00:12:25,975
So, what are we doing today?

221
00:12:26,078 --> 00:12:28,706
Right, I have a kind of mole on my back.

222
00:12:28,814 --> 00:12:30,941
It's probably nothing.
But I'm a cautious guy.

223
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:32,813
I'm exactly the same.

is my guilty-pleasure song.

227

Oh, yeah, it's been stuck in my head
ever since I heard it this weekend

228
00:12:56,041 --> 00:12:59,408
- at brunch.
- I love brunch.

229
00:12:59,512 --> 00:13:01,139
It's the best.

230
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:04,545
As long as I don't have to spend it
with a bunch of phonies.

231
00:13:04,917 --> 00:13:07,408
I like the way you think, architect Mosby.

232
00:13:09,188 --> 00:13:12,021
Hey, this may sound weird.
But it'll definitely sound more weird

233
00:13:12,124 --> 00:13:14,388
once my shirt's off,
so I'm gonna ask you now.

234
00:13:14,493 --> 00:13:17,189
Do you wanna have dinner with me
Saturday night?

235
00:13:17,797 --> 00:13:21,631
That's very sweet, but I'm actually
getting married on Saturday.

236
00:13:23,869 --> 00:13:25,166
Friday night?

237
00:13:29,675 --> 00:13:32,473
Wow. You're getting married.
Congratulations.

238
00:13:32,578 --> 00:13:35,046
- Thank you.
- I'm really sorry I asked you out.

239
00:13:35,147 --> 00:13:38,014
It just felt like there could
be this weird connection between us.

240
00:13:38,117 --> 00:13:40,881
- How crazy am I coming off here?
- Only a little.

241
00:13:41,487 --> 00:13:45,423
Well, by some million-to-one long shot,
and I'm not rooting for this,

242
00:13:46,125 --> 00:13:50,084
you wind up not getting married
this weekend, give me a call.

243
00:13:50,496 --> 00:13:54,455
Okay. But it's not likely.
I look damn good in my dress.

244
00:13:55,201 --> 00:13:56,532
I'm sure you do.

245
00:14:00,706 --> 00:14:03,732
Wow. That's a pretty sophisticated trap.

You think the Road Runner's
gonna fall for it?

247

Okay, we get it. You're skeptical.
But Marshall and I, we're believers.

person and the right person was out there,

00:18:31,743 --> 00:18:35,270
Brace yourself, dude.
This is gonna blow your mind-hole.

328
00:18:39,284 --> 00:18:42,048
You bastard.
I actually got excited about this.

329
00:18:42,154 --> 00:18:44,122
- What?
- It's empty.

330
00:18:46,725 --> 00:18:49,558
Wait, but if it's not here, that means...

331
00:18:50,629 --> 00:18:51,687
Lily!

332
00:18:52,965 --> 00:18:54,557
- Robin!
- What?

333
00:18:54,733 --> 00:18:55,700
(EX CLAIMING)

334
00:18:57,035 --> 00:18:58,002
(MOUSE SQUEAKING)

335
00:18:58,237 --> 00:19:03,140
- Oh, my God! It's real!
- No, is it? Do something!

336
00:19:07,746 --> 00:19:10,738
No! What the hell was that?
You trying to get it drunk?

337
00:19:10,849 --> 00:19:13,181
It was the only thing I could think of!

338
00:19:13,318 --> 00:19:14,876
Lily! Thank God!

339
00:19:16,188 --> 00:19:18,179
(ALL EX CLAIMING IN PANIC)

340
00:19:18,290 --> 00:19:19,917
Lily, I love you!

341
00:19:20,592 --> 00:19:22,753
Robin, open the window!

342
00:19:22,928 --> 00:19:24,361
(SCREAMING)

343
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:29,294
Please, for the love of God,
open the window!

344
00:19:30,536 --> 00:19:31,525
(WINGS FLAPPING)

345
00:19:31,637 --> 00:19:33,229
It can fly.

346
00:19:34,406 --> 00:19:35,896
ALL: Wow.

347
00:19:37,242 --> 00:19:41,508
Be free, mutant beast.
I'll miss this private war of ours.

348
00:19:41,847 --> 00:19:43,610
I grew to admire your tenacious...

349
00:19:43,715 --> 00:19:45,740
Holy mother of God! It's headed this way!

350
00:19:45,851 --> 00:19:47,443
Close the window!

351
00:19:55,494 --> 00:19:56,620
Hi, Ellen.

352
00:19:58,997 --> 00:20:00,862
I think I want my money back.

353
00:20:02,167 --> 00:20:06,399
I'm a failure. I'm all washed up.
I tried everything, Ted.

354
00:20:06,805 --> 00:20:10,206
I widened the search parameters,
I tweaked the program.

355
00:20:10,742 --> 00:20:14,701
Last night, I stood out on the street
for five hours

356
00:20:14,813 --> 00:20:17,680
showing your photo
to random pedestrians. No takers.

357
00:20:18,584 --> 00:20:22,281
Although this transvestite hooker said
he/she would do you for half price

358
00:20:22,387 --> 00:20:23,979
because you kind of look like John Cusack

359
00:20:24,089 --> 00:20:27,183
and his/her favorite movie was
<i>Say Anything,,,</i>

360
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:31,527
Come on, Ellen. I mean, a pint of
ice cream. Isn't that a bit clich??

361
00:20:31,630 --> 00:20:33,120
It's for the bourbon.

362
00:20:34,566 --> 00:20:37,034
This isn't hopeless.
You're gonna find someone for me.

363
00:20:37,135 --> 00:20:40,696
No, I won't. You're gonna die alone.

364
00:20:40,806 --> 00:20:45,709
I'm not gonna die alone. Look at me.
I'm bright. I'm attractive.

365
00:20:45,844 --> 00:20:47,675
You just gotta get back out there
and keep looking.

366
00:20:47,779 --> 00:20:49,679
No. You're never gonna find anybody.

367
00:20:49,781 --> 00:20:53,217
And every year, you're just getting
older and it's getting harder and harder.

368
00:20:53,318 --> 00:20:56,253
You're being ridiculous. I'm gonna be
up on that wall one of these days.

369
00:20:56,355 --> 00:20:58,755
- No, you won't!
- Yes, I will!

370
00:20:58,857 --> 00:21:02,384
- How do you know?
- I don't know, but I believe.

371
00:21:03,028 --> 00:21:06,225
Hell, if a cockroach and a mouse
can find love in this crazy city,

372
00:21:06,331 --> 00:21:07,923
then damn it, so can I!

373
00:21:08,166 --> 00:21:09,497
You're losing me.

374
00:21:10,469 --> 00:21:13,063
The point is,
something good's gonna happen to me.

375
00:21:13,171 --> 00:21:17,073
I mean, maybe your computer will help,
maybe it won't, but it'll happen.

376
00:21:18,944 --> 00:21:22,607
- So I should keep looking?
- Of course you should.

377
00:21:23,148 --> 00:21:26,549
And now, you're gonna do it for free.
