So, the life of a television reporter
is very rewarding,

25

and I strongly urge you
to consider it as a career.

26
00:01:34,427 --> 00:01:35,758
Thank you.

27
00:01:38,131 --> 00:01:40,599
- Yeah.
- Do you have a fianc??

Marshall was here yesterday.
They just learned the word "fianc?."

No, I've got five dogs.

My Grandma has five cats
and she gets Ionely.

Well, yeah, that's cats.
I'm not some pathetic cat lady.

- Why hasn't she called yet?

Okay, you're making yourself crazy.

It's Saturday night.
Go out and do something.

No, what's the point of going out?
I got a girlfriend. For now.

54
00:02:58,711 --> 00:03:00,303
Besides, if I go out,
who's gonna watch the news?

No, and why does this
keep coming up today?

60
00:03:13,126 --> 00:03:14,821
I just thought that guy you
were on the phone with...

61
00:03:14,928 --> 00:03:17,726
What? Oh, no. That was Ted.
He's just a friend.

62
00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:20,526
I mean, there was this moment
where we almost dated,

63
00:03:20,633 --> 00:03:23,033
but we want completely different things.

64
00:03:23,136 --> 00:03:24,967
Anyway, now he has his girlfriend
in Germany

65
00:03:25,071 --> 00:03:26,766
and he thinks she's calling
to dump him tonight,

66
00:03:26,873 --> 00:03:28,363
but I don't think she is.

67
00:03:28,474 --> 00:03:31,136
And, besides,
we want completely different things.

68
00:03:31,244 --> 00:03:33,769
- We should have sex.
- What?

69
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,313
Why not?

70
00:03:35,415 --> 00:03:38,475
We're both available. We're both
attractive. We're both good at it.

71
00:03:38,585 --> 00:03:40,075
At least, I'm good at it.

72
00:03:40,186 --> 00:03:43,883
And even if you're not, don't worry.
I'll have a good time either way.

with people I work with.

76

Get involved? Who said get involved?
I'm just saying we should have sex.

Miss me?

83
00:04:14,887 --> 00:04:16,616
I missed you, too.

but do you want to come over?

- Yeah. Hi, I'm here.

- Do you want to come over?
- Why? What's up?

88
00:05:28,628 --> 00:05:32,724
Well, I just finally set up my new juicer,

89
00:05:32,832 --> 00:05:35,096
and I was gonna make some juice.
And I was like,

90
00:05:35,201 --> 00:05:37,499
"You know who likes juice? Ted."

91
00:05:39,706 --> 00:05:40,695
I love juice.

92
00:05:40,807 --> 00:05:44,265
Great, so you want to come over
and make juice?

<i>2,{{{{{00 a, m, are the wrong decisions,</i>

96
00:05:55,755 --> 00:05:57,450
- juice.
- Yes, we'll juice.

97
00:05:57,890 --> 00:06:00,620
- Okay.
- Okay, bye.

00:06:01,661 --> 00:06:02,787
Bye.

What's fine?

101
00:06:12,538 --> 00:06:16,167
Oh, I'm going over to this girl's house
to make some juice.

00:06:16,509 --> 00:06:17,498
Nice.

103
00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:20,545
No, it's not like that.
We're juicing as friends.

104
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:23,305
See, I have this girlfriend.

105
00:06:23,416 --> 00:06:26,544
I would never cheat on her.
She lives in Germany.

106
00:06:26,786 --> 00:06:30,847
See, she was supposed to call me
four hours ago to have a serious talk.

107
00:06:30,957 --> 00:06:33,892
I still haven't heard from her. I don't know.

You could just let me out right up here.

113

- Where are you going to buddy?
- Park Slope, Eighth and Eighth.

114

Okay, here's where I left off
with the last guy.

115
00:06:55,515 --> 00:06:58,746
See, I have a girlfriend, but I'm going over
to this other girl's house...

116
00:06:58,851 --> 00:07:01,115
And you're wondering if I'd be upset.

117
00:07:01,287 --> 00:07:03,721
Hi, Ted. Remember me? Your girlfriend.

118
00:07:03,823 --> 00:07:05,916
Okay, relax. Robin's just a friend.

119
00:07:06,025 --> 00:07:08,391
Right. You're gonna go make some juice.

120
00:07:08,494 --> 00:07:10,792
Yes, yes. Juice is perfectly harmless.

121
00:07:10,897 --> 00:07:12,626
In fact, it's healthy.

122
00:07:12,732 --> 00:07:15,701
Oh, yeah? Then why are you wondering
what she looks like naked?

123
00:07:15,802 --> 00:07:17,269
I am not...

124
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:20,396
Okay, even if I am wondering that,
it's only 'cause you put it in my head.

125
00:07:20,506 --> 00:07:22,906
But I am just a manifestation
of your subconscious,

126
00:07:23,009 --> 00:07:25,102
so actually, you put it in your own head.

127
00:07:25,211 --> 00:07:26,303
Damn it!

128
00:07:26,412 --> 00:07:27,674
Nothing's gonna happen.

129
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:30,374
- Right.
- Okay, okay. You want a second opinion?

130
00:07:30,483 --> 00:07:31,507
Fine.

Honey, there's a situation developing.

139

Do you remember the huge secret
that you told me

140
00:08:02,315 --> 00:08:04,476
that you weren't supposed to, but you did?

141
00:08:04,584 --> 00:08:06,313
The thing about Robin?

142
00:08:06,419 --> 00:08:06,652
You mean, how Robin's in love with Ted?

143

144

- What?
- What?

145
00:08:08,788 --> 00:08:11,188
Yeah. She told me already. Go on.

Wait. So I'm the only one
that she didn't tell?

147

She told you and not me?

148

Well, I guess I'm just better friends
with her than you are.

00:09:07,046 --> 00:09:09,207
It's bad. You should go home, dude.

170
00:09:09,315 --> 00:09:11,806
Marshall, it's fine.
Nothing's gonna happen.

171
00:09:12,518 --> 00:09:15,681
- Ted, what does your Mom always say?
- Nothing good ever...

172
00:09:15,788 --> 00:09:19,849
Nothing good ever happens after 2:00 a.m.
Go home! It's too late for juice.

173
00:09:19,959 --> 00:09:23,827
Dude, Robin and I are just friends.
She doesn't even like me that way.

174
00:09:23,930 --> 00:09:26,694
Yes, she does! She likes you. She told me.

175
00:09:27,667 --> 00:09:29,191
- What?
- It's a big secret.

176
00:09:29,302 --> 00:09:33,295
So don't tell her I told you,
but she's very vulnerable right now.

177
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:36,239
And you have a girlfriend. Go home, Ted.

178
00:09:36,842 --> 00:09:39,003
- She likes me?
<i>- Yes,</i>

179
00:09:39,111 --> 00:09:42,638
<i>So you see why it would be</i>
<i>a very bad idea for you to go up there,</i>

180
00:09:42,748 --> 00:09:44,375
<i>Go home, Ted,</i>

181
00:09:45,351 --> 00:09:46,841
She likes me?

182
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:48,614
Go home, Ted.

183
00:09:50,623 --> 00:09:54,024
You're right, I'll see you at home.

184
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:57,586
Good. He's going home.

185
00:09:57,697 --> 00:09:59,289
He is so not going home.

186
00:09:59,398 --> 00:10:01,491
I cannot believe you just told him that.

187
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:03,899
- What do you mean?
- Lily, here's what you just said,

188
00:10:04,003 --> 00:10:05,300
"Ted, whatever you do,

189
00:10:05,404 --> 00:10:08,805
"don't go up there. There's a beautiful girl
who wants to have sex with you."

190
00:10:08,908 --> 00:10:12,173
And then she's gonna
make you some delicious juice!

191
00:10:12,478 --> 00:10:16,005
No. He's not going up there.
He has more sense than that.

You're going up there?

197
00:10:40,873 --> 00:10:42,568
I'm not in the way.

00:10:51,984 --> 00:10:53,576
- Hi!
- Hey.

201
00:10:54,053 --> 00:10:56,351
I got some vegetables. I got carrots.
I got beets.

202
00:10:56,455 --> 00:10:58,047
Or we could just drink wine.

203
00:10:58,157 --> 00:11:01,558
Wine not. Wow, that's the stupidest thing
I ever said.

204
00:11:02,395 --> 00:11:03,589
Thanks.

205
00:11:03,963 --> 00:11:05,430

206
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:06,723
Sure.

207
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:10,433
So, how's it hanging? "How's it hanging?"

208
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:12,531
Haven't you ever had one of those days

209
00:11:12,638 --> 00:11:15,766
where nothing at all
that monumental happens,

210
00:11:15,875 --> 00:11:20,005
but, by the end of it, you have no idea
who you are anymore,

211
00:11:20,112 --> 00:11:22,580
or what the hell you're doing
with your life?

212
00:11:22,682 --> 00:11:24,616
Do you ever have one of those days?

213
00:11:24,717 --> 00:11:26,082
About once a week.

214
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:29,314
I don't know. It was just a rough day,

215
00:11:29,422 --> 00:11:33,188
and the only person I wanted to see
at the end of it was you.

216
00:11:35,695 --> 00:11:39,358
So, how was the big phone call
with your girlfriend?

<i>OLDER TED; When the clock strikes two,</i>
<i>just go to sleep,</i>

218

00:11:46,005 --> 00:11:46,994
What?

220
00:11:47,106 --> 00:11:48,903
Yeah. Yeah. She finally called.

221
00:11:49,008 --> 00:11:51,568
We talked for a while.
How hard long distance is,

222
00:11:51,677 --> 00:11:53,975
and then she dumped me.

223
00:11:55,381 --> 00:11:57,246
Ted, I'm so sorry.

224
00:11:57,349 --> 00:11:59,283
That's just terrible.

225
00:11:59,385 --> 00:12:00,943
I feel awful.

226
00:12:01,821 --> 00:12:03,083
You're smiling.

227
00:12:03,189 --> 00:12:04,781
Am I? No, I'm not.

228
00:12:05,991 --> 00:12:07,390
Well, I'm a news anchor.

229
00:12:07,493 --> 00:12:09,085
Smiling is a part of the job.

How much does Korean Elvis rock?

237
00:12:32,718 --> 00:12:35,186
I'll answer that. Infinity.

240

What? No. It's 2:30.

241
00:12:42,862 --> 00:12:45,524
And nothing good ever happens
after 2:00 a.m.

242
00:12:45,631 --> 00:12:48,327
You know, I have found in my travels

243
00:12:48,434 --> 00:12:52,700
that all the best things in life
happen after 2:00 a.m.

244
00:12:52,805 --> 00:12:55,103
When I look back
at the best stories of my life,

00:12:55,207 --> 00:12:59,234
the Liberty Bell incident, the little scrape
I got in at the Russian embassy,

246
00:12:59,345 --> 00:13:01,279
- the almost four-way.
- You never had a four-way.

247
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:03,678
- I said "almost"!
- Well, all right.

248
00:13:03,883 --> 00:13:06,249
All those things happened after 2:00 a.m.

249
00:13:06,352 --> 00:13:12,154
Because after 2:00 a.m. Is when things get,
audience, say it with me, legendary!

250
00:13:13,225 --> 00:13:15,989
- We gotta go.
- What's that? "Interesting theory, Barney,

251
00:13:16,095 --> 00:13:18,461
"but I'll need some proof." Okay.

252
00:13:21,066 --> 00:13:25,560
Korean Elvis. How would you like
to have a drink with me and my friends?

253
00:13:26,138 --> 00:13:27,605
Rock 'n' roll.

254
00:13:28,607 --> 00:13:30,336
And it begins.

255
00:13:32,444 --> 00:13:35,709
So, hey. I got a new phone.

256
00:13:36,182 --> 00:13:37,581
Same as yours. Look.

257
00:13:37,683 --> 00:13:39,344
Oh, yeah, do you like it?

258
00:13:39,952 --> 00:13:41,943
Yeah. Yeah.

259
00:13:42,154 --> 00:13:44,054
This is some solid small talk.

260
00:13:44,824 --> 00:13:47,452
I had that other phone, and it was good,

261
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:50,552
but I think, the whole time,
a little part of me

262
00:13:50,696 --> 00:13:52,391
wanted this phone instead.

263
00:13:52,865 --> 00:13:54,230
This phone

264
00:13:55,534 --> 00:13:56,660

Oh, wow. Weird.

267
00:14:00,306 --> 00:14:03,173
Yeah, I should probably take this.

268
00:14:03,809 --> 00:14:05,674
I'll be here.

269
00:14:11,283 --> 00:14:14,081
- Hello?
- Ted. This is your main man K.E.

270
00:14:14,186 --> 00:14:16,746
I want you to shake your tail feather
down here ASAP. You dig?

271
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:19,086
Okay. Sorry about that.

272
00:14:19,191 --> 00:14:20,749
Who... Was that Korean Elvis?

273
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:24,159
I'll explain later.
Hey, we're heading down to MacLaren's.

274
00:14:24,263 --> 00:14:27,596
Actually, I'm at Robin's.

275
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:31,560
Yeah, and I might have done
something bad.

276
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:35,299
I just lied and told her I broke up
with Victoria.

277
00:14:35,674 --> 00:14:39,041
Ted, I don't want to swear
in front of Korean Elvis,

278
00:14:39,144 --> 00:14:41,738
but what the bleep are you doing, dude?

279
00:14:41,847 --> 00:14:44,042
What do you expect from me? It's Robin!

280
00:14:44,149 --> 00:14:47,016
Victoria's great, but it's Robin!

281
00:14:47,786 --> 00:14:50,016
I've made up my mind,
I'm gonna end it with Victoria.

282
00:14:50,122 --> 00:14:52,420
- Gonna?
- Yes. First thing tomorrow.

283
00:14:52,591 --> 00:14:54,923
Okay, but as of right now,

284
00:14:55,027 --> 00:14:59,361
at 2:45 a.m. You still have a girlfriend.

285
00:14:59,798 --> 00:15:02,232
Ted, I love you. I love Robin.

286
00:15:02,334 --> 00:15:04,359
But if you do this right now,

287
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:07,701
your entire future with her
will be built on a crime!

<i>Don't do this the wrong way!</i>

- I'm sorry. I...
- Oh, no. I understand. It's fine. Yeah.

- Can I call you tomorrow?
- Totally.

297

- Totally. Call me tomorrow.
- Okay.

00:15:50,115 --> 00:15:52,140
- Good night, Robin.
- Good night, Ted.

299

Oh, my God! We're making out.

300
00:16:26,118 --> 00:16:27,551
- Right!
- This is crazy.

301
00:16:27,653 --> 00:16:29,280
Right! Right!

302
00:16:31,623 --> 00:16:35,115

I mean, there's five dogs in there, but...

- Yeah.
- Yeah?

00:16:36,462 --> 00:16:37,622
Yeah.

that conversation's gonna be?

Length of an average pee? No.

316
00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:20,370
We're gonna be on the phone
for at least 20 minutes.

317
00:17:20,472 --> 00:17:23,236
Robin's out there. She's gonna think
you're in here taking a massive...

318

What do you want from me?
People break up. It happens.

Not like this.

320
00:17:29,348 --> 00:17:33,375
Not from the bathroom of the girl
that you're about to sleep with.

321

00:18:27,072 --> 00:18:28,630
<i>The night was legendary,</i>

338
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:32,608
<i>It would come to be known as the time</i>
<i>Lily kicked Korean Elvis in the nards,</i>

339
00:18:32,711 --> 00:18:37,273
Hey, you guys remember that time
that Lily kicked Korean Elvis in the nards?

340
00:18:39,184 --> 00:18:39,284
You're right.

341
00:18:39,284 --> 00:18:40,342
You're right.

342
00:18:40,452 --> 00:18:42,420
I owe you a real breakup call.

343
00:18:42,855 --> 00:18:44,322
I'll call you tomorrow.

344
00:18:44,423 --> 00:18:46,687
Good. So, you're gonna go home?

345
00:18:47,993 --> 00:18:50,086
Why should I have to go home?

346
00:18:50,195 --> 00:18:53,528
You know, there's every chance
Robin's the woman I'm gonna marry.

347
00:18:53,632 --> 00:18:55,395
- Ted.
- It could happen!

348
00:18:55,634 --> 00:18:59,968
And so, really, what's it gonna matter
in 50 years if I jump the gun by one night?

349
00:19:00,072 --> 00:19:03,041
Look, I know this is a moral gray area, but

350
00:19:04,243 --> 00:19:05,574
it's Robin.

351
00:19:06,044 --> 00:19:07,033
And I'm exhausted.

352
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:09,910
I am. I'm exhausted from pretending
I'm not in love with her.

353
00:19:10,015 --> 00:19:11,380
I think that makes this okay.

354
00:19:11,483 --> 00:19:14,008
Oh, please. You just want to get laid!

355
00:19:14,419 --> 00:19:16,614
Yes, I do. You got me.

356
00:19:16,722 --> 00:19:19,316
That is exactly what I want right now.
And so what?

357
00:19:19,424 --> 00:19:21,016
I want this. She wants this.

358
00:19:21,126 --> 00:19:25,290
It's happening. And if you have a problem
with it, don't be in Germany!

359
00:19:25,397 --> 00:19:27,422
It's been nice pretending to talk to you.

360
00:19:27,533 --> 00:19:29,967
Thanks for not calling me and good night.

361
00:19:31,403 --> 00:19:33,064
That's not your phone.

362
00:19:34,206 --> 00:19:35,798
This isn't my phone.

363
00:19:42,514 --> 00:19:44,311
Okay. Bye.

364
00:19:46,919 --> 00:19:49,285
I thought it was mine, so I answered it.

365
00:19:50,422 --> 00:19:52,515
- Was it...
- It was your girlfriend.

366
00:19:53,892 --> 00:19:55,883
You might want to call her back.

367
00:20:17,516 --> 00:20:20,713
<i>OLDER TED; I called Victoria from the cab,</i>
<i>and we broke up,</i>

368
00:20:21,653 --> 00:20:23,052
Yes, I'm...

369
00:20:23,388 --> 00:20:25,447
<i>And there you have it, kids,</i>

370
00:20:25,557 --> 00:20:28,025
<i>The stupidest thing I've ever done,</i>

371
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:32,421
<i>In one night, I managed to hurt</i>
<i>two people I cared about,</i>

372
00:20:32,531 --> 00:20:36,160
<i>And none of it would've happened</i>
<i>if I had just listened to my mom,</i>

373
00:20:46,612 --> 00:20:49,945
<i>So, I guess if there's a lesson</i>
<i>to be learned here, it's this,</i>

374
00:20:50,649 --> 00:20:52,617
<i>when it's after 2,{{{{{00 a, m,,</i>

375
00:20:53,185 --> 00:20:54,709
<i>just go to sleep,</i>
