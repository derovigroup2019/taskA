<i>OLDER TED; When your Uncle Marshall</i>
<i>was 10 years old,</i>

1
00:00:18,051 --> 00:00:20,383
<i>he read a book called</i>
Life Among The Gorillas.

2
00:00:20,954 --> 00:00:25,550
<i>It was written by an anthropologist</i>
<i>named Dr, Aurelia Birnholz-Vazquez,</i>

3
00:00:25,658 --> 00:00:27,353
<i>and it told the story of the year she spent</i>

4
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:30,896
<i>living among the western lowland gorillas</i>
<i>of Cameroon,</i>

5
00:00:31,131 --> 00:00:32,928
<i>When Dr, Birnholz-Vazquez</i>

6
00:00:33,033 --> 00:00:35,593
<i>came to the local community college</i>

<i>Marshall, the youngest member</i>

8

<i>raised his hand with a question,</i>

9
00:00:40,507 --> 00:00:43,533
What advice do you have
for a budding anthropologist?

10
00:00:43,643 --> 00:00:45,440
So, you want to be an anthropologist?

11
00:00:45,545 --> 00:00:49,037
Yep. When I grow up, I want to go live
with the gorillas just like you did.

12

<i>OLDER TED; What she said next</i>

Oh, that's wonderful,
but I'm afraid you can't.

14

They'll all be dead by then.

15

And if economic sanctions
and trade restrictions aren't enforced,

16
00:01:03,063 --> 00:01:04,928
the destruction of the rainforests
will continue,

17
00:01:05,031 --> 00:01:07,966
and over a million species
will be wiped out.

18

00:08:23,436 --> 00:08:25,097
But how's she gonna feel
in a couple of years

164
00:08:25,204 --> 00:08:27,968
when she's supporting you
on a kindergarten-teacher's salary,

165
00:08:28,074 --> 00:08:29,598
while you're off in court,

166
00:08:29,709 --> 00:08:34,442
defending some endangered
South American flying beaver.

167
00:08:35,982 --> 00:08:37,142
I know.

168
00:08:38,584 --> 00:08:40,643
- She'll be happy.
- Okay.

169
00:08:41,721 --> 00:08:43,416
But will you be happy,

170
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:46,515
knowing you could have
made her a lot happier?

171
00:08:48,728 --> 00:08:52,095
And all four are totally naked.
You gotta choose one.

172
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:53,927
What do you do? Go.

173
00:08:55,468 --> 00:08:58,904
I guess, uh, Bea Arthur.

174
00:08:59,038 --> 00:09:00,062
(IMITATING BUZZER SOUNDING)

175
00:09:00,172 --> 00:09:01,867
Wrong. Betty White.

176
00:09:03,409 --> 00:09:05,604
Clean this stuff up, Eriksen.

177
00:09:08,981 --> 00:09:11,313
So, did she get
the awesome care package, yet?

178
00:09:11,417 --> 00:09:12,714
Yep. Yesterday.

179
00:09:12,818 --> 00:09:15,753
- Did she love it?
- Oh, she loved it.

180
00:09:15,855 --> 00:09:17,755
So, what's the problem?

181
00:09:17,857 --> 00:09:20,417
So, I was talking to her last night,
and I should tell you,

182
00:09:20,526 --> 00:09:22,118
we've been talking on the phone
every other night,

183
00:09:22,228 --> 00:09:25,629
for, like, an hour and a half.
Eventually, you just run out of stuff to say.

184
00:09:27,833 --> 00:09:30,267
What did you have for lunch today?

185
00:09:30,536 --> 00:09:31,560
Mmm-hmm.

186
00:09:31,671 --> 00:09:33,161
Oh, rye bread.

187
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:35,101
Oh.

188
00:09:37,009 --> 00:09:38,033
(SIGHING)

189
00:09:38,144 --> 00:09:39,304
Mmm-hmm.

190
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:41,838
Yeah.

191
00:09:42,548 --> 00:09:43,708
Mmm.

192
00:09:48,721 --> 00:09:50,279
Oh, Teddy boy.

193
00:09:50,489 --> 00:09:52,320
I'm usually so good at being a boyfriend,

194
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:54,723
but this never-seeing-each-other thing,
it's a bitch.

195
00:09:54,827 --> 00:09:56,988
Maybe it just can't be done.

196
00:09:57,096 --> 00:09:59,621
I think it's clear what I have to do.

197
00:09:59,732 --> 00:10:01,359
It's pretty clear.

198
00:10:02,134 --> 00:10:04,898
I have to go to Germany and surprise her.

199
00:10:05,004 --> 00:10:09,100
Totally what I was thinking.
Get out of my head, man.

200
00:10:13,512 --> 00:10:15,980
Barney, how do I get these idiots
to leave me alone?

201
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:19,782
Marshall, consider the penguins.

202
00:10:20,686 --> 00:10:22,813
- The penguins?
- On the wall.

203
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:32,187
"Conformity. It's the one who's different
that gets left out in the cold."

204
00:10:32,298 --> 00:10:34,095
This is a motivational poster?

205
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:36,191
Look at yourself, Marshall.
You're not happy.

206
00:10:36,302 --> 00:10:39,271
And you know why?
Because you're different.

207
00:10:39,372 --> 00:10:41,704
Now, I suppose you could learn
to love yourself

208
00:10:41,807 --> 00:10:44,401
for the unique little snowflake
that you are.

209
00:10:44,510 --> 00:10:47,001
Or you could change
your entire personality,

210
00:10:47,113 --> 00:10:49,513
which is just so much easier.

211
00:10:50,216 --> 00:10:54,949
Change your personality? That is so awful.
And not at all motivational.

212
00:10:55,054 --> 00:10:57,852
Not necessarily.
Okay, at first, I was appalled.

213
00:10:57,957 --> 00:10:59,185
But then I realized

214
00:10:59,291 --> 00:11:03,091
it's just like Dr. Aurelia Birnholz-Vazquez
in <i>Life Among The Gorillas,</i>

215
00:11:03,195 --> 00:11:05,425
No, I have to gain the acceptance
of the herd

216
00:11:05,531 --> 00:11:07,726
by behaving exactly like one of them.

217
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:10,666
It's an anthropological study.
Isn't that cool?

218
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:12,863
Well, it sounds kind of like peer pressure.

219
00:11:12,972 --> 00:11:15,998
No, no, no. It's totally anthropological.

220
00:11:16,108 --> 00:11:18,338
And it's cool. And I'm doing it.

221
00:11:18,444 --> 00:11:22,881
Yeah, I'm pretty sure it's peer pressure.
We have an assembly every year.

222
00:11:22,982 --> 00:11:26,577
I'm portraying someone
who succumbs to peer pressure.

223
00:11:26,819 --> 00:11:28,013
All right.

224
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:32,056
But if those guys try to pressure you
to smoke, what do you say?

225
00:11:32,391 --> 00:11:34,689
- Only when I'm drunk.
- Good boy.

226
00:11:35,528 --> 00:11:37,189
<i>OLDER TED; And so,</i>
<i>to fit in with the gorillas,</i>

227
00:11:37,296 --> 00:11:39,696
<i>Marshall had to learn to act like a gorilla,</i>

228
00:11:39,799 --> 00:11:41,960
<i>And that meant gorilla lessons,</i>

229
00:11:42,068 --> 00:11:46,004
Okay. I'm psyched about this.
But if I'm gonna mentor you,

230
00:11:46,105 --> 00:11:47,834
I need to know
you're psyched about this, too.

231
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:49,965
Oh, I am. I'm psyched.

232
00:11:50,576 --> 00:11:54,603
Yeah, but it's one thing to say it.
It's another thing to show it.

233
00:11:55,881 --> 00:11:57,109
Show it.

234
00:12:00,686 --> 00:12:02,085
I'm psyched.

235
00:12:03,222 --> 00:12:04,689
What was that?

236
00:12:07,626 --> 00:12:10,754
Marshall, I should feel
tremors of psychetude

237
00:12:10,863 --> 00:12:13,297
rock my body like a seizure.

238
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:18,598
That was like a declawed, pregnant cat
on a porch swing idly swatting at a fly

239
00:12:18,704 --> 00:12:20,763
on a lazy Sunday afternoon.

240
00:12:21,707 --> 00:12:25,609
- Wow, that was really specific.
- Show me you're psyched!

241
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:30,071
Let's do this!

242
00:12:30,783 --> 00:12:33,183
- That hurt!
- So badly!

243
00:12:33,986 --> 00:12:37,422
And then you slip it to the guy
with a discreet handshake,

244
00:12:37,523 --> 00:12:39,286
- and he'll get it done.
- Right.

245
00:12:39,692 --> 00:12:40,818
Get what done?

246
00:12:40,926 --> 00:12:43,724
- Whatever.
- Cool. And what guy is this?

247
00:12:44,497 --> 00:12:47,796
- There's always a guy.
- Okay. All right. I, uh...

248
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:50,197
- I think I'm ready.
- You sure?

249
00:12:50,302 --> 00:12:53,294
You want to practice your story
one more time?

250
00:12:53,572 --> 00:12:54,937
All right.

251
00:12:57,676 --> 00:13:01,908
So, dude, check it. I'm in San Diego
with two of my brosephs from Kappa,

252
00:13:02,014 --> 00:13:05,882
and they're all,
"Yo, Eriksen, let's roll to the strip clubs!"

253
00:13:05,985 --> 00:13:08,249
So, I'm like, "A-snappa-doo!"

254
00:13:08,354 --> 00:13:10,822
So we find this choice nudie nest
near the airport.

255
00:13:10,923 --> 00:13:13,915
And that is when the bouncer
kicked us out.

256
00:13:14,026 --> 00:13:17,325
Now, I have no idea
if Svetlana ever got her green card,

257
00:13:17,429 --> 00:13:19,954
but, dudes, fake diamond ring?

258
00:13:20,332 --> 00:13:22,266
Worth every penny, bro.

259
00:13:23,702 --> 00:13:28,571
Eriksen, that was steak sauce!

260
00:13:29,942 --> 00:13:31,910
- Awesome, bro.
- Yeah. Yeah.

261
00:13:32,011 --> 00:13:34,138
- Get out!
- Great story.

"Listen, I've been thinking,"

271
00:14:09,715 --> 00:14:11,182
and then followed it up
with something good?

272
00:14:11,283 --> 00:14:15,811
It's not like, "Listen, I've been thinking,
Nutter Butters are an underrated cookie."

273
00:14:16,488 --> 00:14:17,648
What else could it be?

274
00:14:17,756 --> 00:14:20,884
What could she possibly have to say to me
that she couldn't write in an e-mail?

275

I cut off all my fingers.

276
00:14:24,563 --> 00:14:28,465
Ted, you're a great guy. I know it.
You know it. She knows it.

277
00:14:28,634 --> 00:14:32,195
I would bet you a gazillion dollars.
No, I'm even more confident.

278
00:14:32,304 --> 00:14:36,434
I would bet you a floppity jillion dollars
that she's not calling to break up with you.

she didn't run around

Why?

Because you're acting
like one of those guys,

When were you gonna tell me
you changed your entire career path?

Nothing has changed, okay?
I still want to help the environment.

I just thought that maybe
I can make some money for a few years.

We could buy an apartment,
send our kids to good schools.

Go out and do something.

No, what's the point of going out?
I got a girlfriend. For now.

You're awesome.
