<i>OLDER TED; Kids, something you</i>
<i>might not know about your Uncle Marshall</i>

1
00:00:08,274 --> 00:00:10,401
<i>is that he's always been good at games,</i>

2
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:11,841
<i>I mean unbeatable,</i>

3
00:00:11,945 --> 00:00:13,003
Gin!

4
00:00:15,081 --> 00:00:16,309
Yahtzee!

5
00:00:17,517 --> 00:00:18,643
Poker!

6
00:00:19,452 --> 00:00:21,647
You don't have to shout out "poker"
when you win.

7
00:00:21,755 --> 00:00:23,620
I know. It's just fun to say.

8
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:25,282
<i>OLDER TED; We all finally agreed,</i>

9
00:00:25,392 --> 00:00:27,155
<i>Marshall should be</i>
<i>running our game nights,</i>

10
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:28,522
<i>instead of playing in them,</i>

11
00:00:28,628 --> 00:00:31,620
<i>Which he took to mean,</i>
<i>"Invent your own game,"</i>

12
00:00:31,831 --> 00:00:34,391
It's called "Marshgammon."

13
00:00:34,868 --> 00:00:37,496
It combines all the best features
of all the best games,

14
00:00:37,604 --> 00:00:39,799
Candyland, I Never, Pictionary.

15
00:00:39,906 --> 00:00:41,498
- Backgammon, obviously.
- No.

16
00:00:41,608 --> 00:00:43,132
Backgammon sucks.

17
00:00:43,243 --> 00:00:45,643
I took the only good part of
"backgammon," the "gammon,"

18
00:00:45,745 --> 00:00:49,237
and I left the rest of it in the trash
where it belongs.

19
00:00:49,616 --> 00:00:51,982
I'm so excited Victoria's coming.

20
00:00:52,085 --> 00:00:53,916
I'm gonna go get another round.

21
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:56,614
Okay. I wanna lay down
some ground rules for tonight, Barney.

22
00:00:56,723 --> 00:00:59,419
I actually like Victoria a lot.

23
00:00:59,526 --> 00:01:02,757
So, don't say anything...
Don't say anything.

24
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:06,431
And, guys, I haven't exactly told Victoria

25
00:01:06,533 --> 00:01:08,501
that I used to have
a kind of thing for Robin,

26
00:01:08,601 --> 00:01:12,867
- so if we could just avoid the...
- Well, well, well, how rich.

27
00:01:13,373 --> 00:01:16,638
You make me promise to be on
my best behavior around your girlfriend,

28
00:01:16,743 --> 00:01:19,644
yet you have been lying to her
since day one.

29
00:01:20,046 --> 00:01:21,343
Excuse me.

30
00:01:22,148 --> 00:01:23,274
Hi, Leg Warehouse?

31
00:01:23,383 --> 00:01:25,874
Yeah, my friend Ted
needs something to stand on.

32
00:01:25,985 --> 00:01:29,421
So, nothing for him to stand on?
Okay, thanks so much.

33
00:01:30,356 --> 00:01:34,850
Ted, doesn't Victoria deserve to know
that you once had the hots for Robin?

34
00:01:35,528 --> 00:01:39,055
I have half a mind
to tell the story of the re-return.

35
00:01:39,732 --> 00:01:42,257
(WHISPERING) No,
I swore you to secrecy on that.

36
00:01:42,368 --> 00:01:46,099
I am smelling dirt.
What is the story of the re-return?

37
00:01:46,206 --> 00:01:47,867
Nothing. It's nothing.

38
00:01:47,974 --> 00:01:49,532
And, speaking of digging up dirt,

39
00:01:49,642 --> 00:01:51,906
can I count on you two
to behave around Victoria?

40
00:01:52,011 --> 00:01:54,070
Us? What would we do?

41
00:01:54,447 --> 00:01:57,883
Look, you guys have always been
like the parents that I still have,

42
00:01:57,984 --> 00:02:00,009
and, in fact, moved here to get away from.

43
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:03,180
However, could we skip
the traditional interrogation

44
00:02:03,289 --> 00:02:05,519
of the new girlfriend tonight?

45
00:02:05,625 --> 00:02:06,819
- Fine.
- Fine.

46
00:02:06,926 --> 00:02:07,984
Thank you.

47
00:02:08,094 --> 00:02:10,619
- I should go help Robin.
- Okay.

48
00:02:12,699 --> 00:02:14,064
- Hey.
- Hey.

49
00:02:14,334 --> 00:02:17,701
So, you gonna be okay
hanging out with Victoria tonight?

50
00:02:17,804 --> 00:02:19,635
Oh, sure. She's great.

51
00:02:20,406 --> 00:02:22,966
Oh, what? Because of the whole thing
where I said I liked Ted?

52
00:02:23,076 --> 00:02:24,703
No. Victoria is great.

53
00:02:24,811 --> 00:02:27,712
She's fun, she's free-spirited. She's great.

54
00:02:28,248 --> 00:02:30,216
I said "She's great" too many times,
didn't I?

55
00:02:30,316 --> 00:02:32,580
You must really hate the bitch.

56
00:02:33,586 --> 00:02:37,579
But if you roll an even number
while adjacent to the Peppermint Forest,

57
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:40,818
then you "Marshall Out,"
and all your chips go into the pot.

58
00:02:40,927 --> 00:02:44,761
And remember,
if you ever ask the question, "What,"

59
00:02:44,864 --> 00:02:47,059
then you gotta drink.

60
00:02:47,734 --> 00:02:48,701

61

- No idea what you're talking about.

Okay, okay. All right, no, no.

00:02:52,338 --> 00:02:54,670
We'll just start. You guys will pick it up.
Newbie goes first.

- Okay.

65
00:02:57,277 --> 00:03:00,542
Three! You got "Autobiography."

66
00:03:00,647 --> 00:03:04,208
Now, that's where you have to answer
a personal question about your dating life,

67
00:03:04,317 --> 00:03:06,114
truthfully, in order to move on.

68
00:03:06,219 --> 00:03:09,882
- Marshall, come on.
- Hey. She's the one who rolled a three.

Victoria.

00:03:13,059 --> 00:03:16,392
"Have you ever cheated
while in a relationship?"

71
00:03:16,496 --> 00:03:18,225
Wow, good question.

72
00:03:18,331 --> 00:03:20,799
- You don't have to answer that.
- It's okay.

73
00:03:21,701 --> 00:03:25,398
Well, I was in a really crappy relationship
in college,

74
00:03:25,505 --> 00:03:29,168
and I wound up kissing this guy
at a party one night

75
00:03:29,275 --> 00:03:33,075
and I felt terrible about it,
so I came clean and we broke up.

76
00:03:35,215 --> 00:03:38,412
Victoria, that was an honest
and mature answer.

77
00:03:38,518 --> 00:03:40,952
You may advance
to the Gumdrop Mountains.

78
00:03:42,422 --> 00:03:46,017
So, Victoria,
did you ever re-return to this guy?

79
00:03:46,125 --> 00:03:48,719
- What?
- You said what. You gotta drink.

80
00:03:50,563 --> 00:03:54,499
Oh, Barney, by the way, I went to a party
in that new building on 82nd,

81
00:03:54,601 --> 00:03:56,193
and the host said she knew you.

82
00:03:56,302 --> 00:03:59,362
- What is her name? Sharon? Shannon?
- Shannon?

83
00:04:00,373 --> 00:04:02,000
Shannon, Shannon.

84
00:04:02,508 --> 00:04:04,806
No. Don't remember any Shannon.

85
00:04:05,044 --> 00:04:07,672
Really? Well, 'cause she gave me
a videotape to give you.

86
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:09,407
Where's the tape?

87
00:04:12,018 --> 00:04:13,383
I'll get it.

Cool. Okay. You know, whenever.

00:04:15,955 --> 00:04:18,355
Okay, Robin. Your roll.

- Damn it!

and hidden the real tape in my purse.

00:19:53,725 --> 00:19:56,216
You let me dodge a bullet, Big Guy.

339
00:19:56,728 --> 00:20:00,255
Plus, here's the mini-cherry,
on top of the regular cherry,

340
00:20:00,365 --> 00:20:02,959
on top of the sundae of awesomeness
that is my life.

341
00:20:03,068 --> 00:20:05,832
After Shannon and I talked, I nailed her.

342
00:20:06,972 --> 00:20:07,996
- No.
- Yeah.

343
00:20:08,106 --> 00:20:09,130
- No.
- Yeah.

344
00:20:09,241 --> 00:20:11,334
Sorry, don't buy it. You're making it up.

345
00:20:11,443 --> 00:20:14,674
You're just trying to cover the fact
that you actually had a profound moment

346
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:16,008
of doubt about yourself and...

347
00:20:16,114 --> 00:20:17,206
<i>(SHANNON MOANING)</i>

348
00:20:17,316 --> 00:20:19,546
- Oh, my God.
<i>- SHANNON; Oh, Barney, oh,</i>

349
00:20:19,651 --> 00:20:21,710
Video's pretty good on this phone, huh?

350
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:22,912
<i>SHANNON; Is your phone on?</i>

351
00:20:23,021 --> 00:20:25,819
<i>BARNEY; Oh, no, it just takes a while</i>
<i>to power down,</i>

352
00:20:25,924 --> 00:20:28,017
Oh, gross. Just stop it.

353
00:20:28,126 --> 00:20:29,093
(CHUCKLING)

354
00:20:30,295 --> 00:20:32,525
Ladies, gentlemen, Ted.

355
00:20:34,299 --> 00:20:35,926
This has been a wonderful evening.

356
00:20:36,034 --> 00:20:39,697
I got great dirt on all you guys.
I got Ted to tell the re-return.

357
00:20:39,805 --> 00:20:42,740
I finally nailed Shannon!
Told her I'd call her tomorrow.

358
00:20:42,841 --> 00:20:44,240
Yeah, right.

359
00:20:44,776 --> 00:20:48,405
And I rediscovered
just how awesomely awesome my life is.

360
00:20:48,513 --> 00:20:50,208
Peace out, <i>hombres,</i>

361
00:20:54,052 --> 00:20:56,520
I think Barney just won game night.

362
00:20:58,457 --> 00:21:01,722
<i>OLDER TED; We spend so much effort</i>
<i>trying to keep parts of our lives hidden,</i>

363
00:21:02,127 --> 00:21:04,061
<i>even from our closest friends</i>

364
00:21:04,162 --> 00:21:06,687
<i>that those rare times</i>
<i>when we do open up,</i>

365
00:21:06,798 --> 00:21:10,290
<i>it's amazing how minor those secrets</i>
<i>all end up seeming,</i>

366
00:21:17,876 --> 00:21:19,241
$100 says when you turn around...

367
00:21:19,344 --> 00:21:22,438
<i>Of course,</i>
<i>not every secret was told that night,</i>

368
00:21:23,649 --> 00:21:26,277
<i>But that's getting ahead of the story,</i>
