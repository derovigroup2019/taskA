Yeah, I ship out tomorrow. Two years.

11

You know, some people say

12
00:00:45,345 --> 00:00:48,041
the Peace Corps is the most noble thing
a person can do.

13
00:00:48,148 --> 00:00:50,343
To those people I say, "Is it?"

14
00:00:50,450 --> 00:00:53,010
And usually, they say, "Yes, it is."

15
00:00:53,553 --> 00:00:55,680
But, Barney, they are so right.

16
00:00:55,789 --> 00:00:57,950
Wish there was something I could do.

That cake! Best cake I ever had.

You know, I should tell you, I have a rule.

36
00:02:04,057 --> 00:02:06,287
I never hook up at weddings.

37
00:02:06,526 --> 00:02:08,756
I'm guessing
you haven't always had this rule.

38
00:02:08,862 --> 00:02:12,320
Well, here's the thing.
Those big, romantic moments,

39
00:02:12,432 --> 00:02:15,299
they're great when they happen,
but they're not real.

40
00:02:15,435 --> 00:02:17,562
Exactly. Exactly. Like just now,

41
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:19,467

doing the Chicken Dance out there,

Sadly, not out of character.

45

- Exactly.

00:02:33,386 --> 00:02:36,219

is why I'm not putting the moves on you.

48

- This isn't the moves?
- What, you... You think this is the moves?

So the thing that always screws it up
is the next day. Right?

58
00:03:04,617 --> 00:03:08,053

that will never be tarnished.

And then, when we're old and gray,

67
00:03:38,918 --> 00:03:41,045
we'll look back on this night,

68
00:03:41,154 --> 00:03:43,281

00:09:10,283 --> 00:09:13,741
Maybe she was a ghost.
That's why she didn't want to kiss you.

170
00:09:13,853 --> 00:09:16,788
Because you'd just pass right through her
and feel really cold for a second.

171
00:09:16,889 --> 00:09:19,119
Oh, my God, I just had a great idea
for a screenplay.

172
00:09:19,225 --> 00:09:21,489
Marshall, she was not a ghost.

173
00:09:21,727 --> 00:09:23,456
I know that she wasn't a ghost.

174
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:26,259
She picked up a bouquet
proving she had corporeal form.

175
00:09:27,366 --> 00:09:29,493
Wait! She was sitting across
from a couple of bridesmaids.

176
00:09:29,602 --> 00:09:31,797
She must have been at their table.
Maybe they know who she was.

177
00:09:31,904 --> 00:09:34,771
Great! So, how do we get in touch
with the bridesmaids?

178
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:40,944
This better be good.
I'm about to enter Nirvana.

179
00:09:41,047 --> 00:09:42,878
By the way, I should get you
Nirvana's phone number.

180
00:09:42,982 --> 00:09:44,916
She gives a great massage. Say what?

181
00:09:45,017 --> 00:09:46,245
Barney!

182
00:09:47,219 --> 00:09:48,914
I know the house rules.

184
00:09:51,157 --> 00:09:53,819
Listen, Barney. I saw you talking
to that bridesmaid last night.

185
00:09:53,926 --> 00:09:56,759
- Did you happen to get her phone number?
- You know I did.

186
00:09:56,862 --> 00:09:59,456
Great! I'm gonna need you
to call her for me.

187
00:09:59,565 --> 00:10:01,192
You know I won't.

188
00:10:01,901 --> 00:10:03,027
Why not?

189
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:06,764
Because, we just hooked up last night.
I can't call the girl the next day.

190
00:10:06,872 --> 00:10:09,807
I have to wait at least, like, forever.

191
00:10:09,909 --> 00:10:11,877
Oh, snap! Never gonna call her.

192
00:10:12,378 --> 00:10:14,608
Besides, she thinks
I'm on my way to India.

193
00:10:14,714 --> 00:10:17,706
Oh, come on, Barney. It's for a good cause.

194
00:10:18,484 --> 00:10:23,285
Ted going all castrati over yet another girl
is exactly not a good cause.

195
00:10:23,389 --> 00:10:25,687
Sorry, buddy, I wish I could help you.
My hands are tied.

196
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:27,554
Oh, no, wait, that was last night.

(MIMICS WHIP CRACKING)

198
00:10:29,996 --> 00:10:32,191
Okay, Barney,
I'll tell you what I'm gonna do.

199
00:10:32,431 --> 00:10:33,489
You make this call

200
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:37,626
and I will go with you to Foxy Boxing.

201
00:10:38,337 --> 00:10:39,702
- Really?
- Yeah.

202
00:10:39,805 --> 00:10:42,296
But, you always said
the Foxy Boxing girls were neither foxy,

203
00:10:42,408 --> 00:10:45,673
- nor good at boxing.
- I'm ready to be proven wrong.

204
00:10:45,845 --> 00:10:47,210
- Tonight?
- Tonight!

205
00:10:47,313 --> 00:10:48,405
Dial.

206
00:10:49,048 --> 00:10:52,540
Yeah, Tanya. Turns out I don't leave
for the Peace Corps until tomorrow.

207
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:54,552
Yeah, I know. It sucks.

208
00:10:54,687 --> 00:10:57,121
Just one fewer day I get to help people.

209
00:10:57,523 --> 00:10:59,991
Anyway, this girl, any idea who she was?

210
00:11:00,526 --> 00:11:02,687
Hold on. What kind of shoes was she...

211
00:11:02,795 --> 00:11:04,262
No, Tanya, he's a dude.

212
00:11:04,363 --> 00:11:06,422
He's not gonna know
what kind of shoes she was wearing.

213
00:11:06,532 --> 00:11:07,692
Actually...

214
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:08,960
Oh, come on!

215
00:11:10,236 --> 00:11:11,396
Hey!

216
00:11:13,272 --> 00:11:15,297
So, what do you want to do next?
Don't think!

217
00:11:15,408 --> 00:11:18,002
First thing that comes into your mind.

218
00:11:18,711 --> 00:11:21,179
Hold this.

219
00:11:21,914 --> 00:11:23,279
And this.

220
00:11:26,185 --> 00:11:27,584
There she goes.

221
00:11:28,254 --> 00:11:32,623
Apparently, she was wearing brown shoes

222
00:11:33,325 --> 00:11:35,623
with little snowflakes on them.

223
00:11:37,163 --> 00:11:39,154
Yeah, they do sound cute.

224
00:11:39,799 --> 00:11:41,323
Any idea who...

225
00:11:42,401 --> 00:11:45,234
Okay. Well, thanks anyway.
Yeah, you take care.

226
00:11:45,337 --> 00:11:46,599
What's...

227
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:47,730
Tonight?

228
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:50,400
Well, I'm shipping out pretty early.

229
00:11:50,509 --> 00:11:53,444
So, I won't be able to stay over,
but, yeah, sure, I'd love to.

230
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:55,741
Okay. I'll talk to you later.

231
00:11:55,881 --> 00:11:57,940
Sorry, Ted, I won't be able
to make Foxy Boxing tonight.

232
00:11:58,050 --> 00:11:59,347
I understand.

233
00:11:59,452 --> 00:12:01,477
Okay. Let's not lose hope.

234
00:12:01,587 --> 00:12:04,283
We'll call the hotel.
Maybe she was staying there.

235
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:07,359
We'll have them check the registry
for anyone named Victoria.

236
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:10,623
- Or maybe she goes by Vicky or Tori...
- Or Ictor.

237
00:12:11,831 --> 00:12:14,265
She probably doesn't go by Ictor.

238
00:12:16,635 --> 00:12:20,628
No, you know what? This is fate.
I am never supposed to see this girl again.

239
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:24,141
That was the whole point of the night.
I've just been saved from myself.

240
00:12:24,243 --> 00:12:26,108
- Let's drink many beers.
- Agreed.

(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

00:12:34,253 --> 00:12:36,744
- Hey, there's the anchor lady.
- Hello.

244
00:12:36,856 --> 00:12:38,824
- How was it?
- Oh, I don't know.

245
00:12:38,924 --> 00:12:41,358
Why don't you ask the new substitute
weekend anchor?

246
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:44,156
Robin? Thanks, Robin. It was awesome.

247
00:12:44,263 --> 00:12:46,561
- Back to you, Robin.
- Congrats!

248
00:12:46,665 --> 00:12:48,189
- Thanks.
- That's so cool.

249
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:50,393
Yeah, I felt really bad
bailing on Ted though.

250
00:12:50,503 --> 00:12:52,835
Oh, don't even worry about it. In fact...

251
00:12:52,938 --> 00:12:55,031
<i>And then Lily told her the whole story,</i>

252
00:12:55,141 --> 00:12:58,474

253
00:12:58,577 --> 00:12:59,839

254
00:13:01,413 --> 00:13:02,539
What?

255
00:13:03,215 --> 00:13:04,842
I know who she is.

256
00:13:09,488 --> 00:13:13,015
You know who she is?
But you weren't even at the wedding.

257
00:13:13,359 --> 00:13:16,385
Actually I kind of was.

258
00:13:16,862 --> 00:13:17,920
What?

259
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:20,428
Well, after the newscast I was so excited,

260
00:13:20,533 --> 00:13:23,832
I decided to surprise Ted
by going to the reception.

261
00:13:36,382 --> 00:13:37,906
Oh, damn it.

262
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:39,749
Oh, stop it.

263
00:13:40,052 --> 00:13:41,519
What the hell?

264
00:13:42,188 --> 00:13:43,382
VICTORIA: Hello?

265
00:13:43,689 --> 00:13:44,883
You okay in there?

266
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:46,582
Yeah, I'm fine!

267
00:13:47,693 --> 00:13:51,151
Just allergies or something. I'm fine.

268
00:13:53,465 --> 00:13:56,730
Listen, do you wanna come
and cry out here?

269
00:13:57,169 --> 00:13:59,228
I've been told I'm an excellent hugger.

270
00:13:59,338 --> 00:14:00,669
Oh, thanks.

271
00:14:01,407 --> 00:14:03,932
But I don't actually cry in front of people

272
00:14:04,043 --> 00:14:07,171
or cry at all for that matter.

273
00:14:08,447 --> 00:14:10,074
Man, it's gross.

274
00:14:11,016 --> 00:14:13,985
Does everyone snot up this much
when they cry?

275
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:16,882
Hey, you're speaking to a fellow snotter.

276
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:21,588
So, why you crying?

277
00:14:21,894 --> 00:14:24,294
Because you have feelings for Ted.

278
00:14:24,930 --> 00:14:27,296
I don't know. Maybe?

279
00:14:27,399 --> 00:14:31,301
Okay, what is wrong with the two of you?
Seriously!

280
00:14:31,437 --> 00:14:35,203
He likes you, and you like him,
and just be together!

281

Jeez, Louise,
happiness is not that difficult.

282
00:14:38,077 --> 00:14:39,408
Oh, look, okay.

283
00:14:39,511 --> 00:14:43,174
Yes, I cried in the bathroom
and that was weird.

284
00:14:43,282 --> 00:14:45,842
But that doesn't mean
I'm in love with the guy.

285
00:14:45,951 --> 00:14:48,647
The fact is, I don't know how I feel.

286
00:14:48,754 --> 00:14:50,119
Yes, you do.

287
00:14:50,222 --> 00:14:52,747
Seeing him with someone else
and crying about it?

288
00:14:52,858 --> 00:14:54,655
Guess what? That's how you feel!

289
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:57,160
That is nothing but how you feel.

290
00:14:58,764 --> 00:15:01,426
Okay, fine, I have feelings for him. Happy?

291
00:15:01,533 --> 00:15:03,091
Kind of, yeah.

292
00:15:04,770 --> 00:15:07,102
But it doesn't change anything.

293
00:15:07,239 --> 00:15:10,902
I still don't wanna get married,
and he's still Ted.

294
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:15,870
What I should do is just tell him
who Victoria is, so he can be happy.

295
00:15:15,981 --> 00:15:20,645
Or you could tell him that you're into him
and then you could both be happy.

296
00:15:20,786 --> 00:15:22,651
I'm gonna go find him.

297
00:15:23,622 --> 00:15:24,987
Well, wait.

298
00:15:25,624 --> 00:15:27,990
Which one are you gonna tell him?

299
00:15:28,394 --> 00:15:29,918
I have no idea.

300
00:15:31,096 --> 00:15:32,688
And here's the most amazing part.

301
00:15:32,798 --> 00:15:36,165
Because I told her I had converted
all my money to India dollars,

302
00:15:36,268 --> 00:15:39,203
she gave me $50 to take a cab
to the airport.

303
00:15:39,305 --> 00:15:41,933
That's right. I just got paid for sex.

304
00:15:42,908 --> 00:15:44,569
I really should give this money
to the Peace Corps.

305

I'm a crazy person.

Why don't you take this?

326
00:16:50,709 --> 00:16:52,609
Sounds like you could use it.

00:17:30,215 --> 00:17:31,739
She has to move in with us.

341
00:17:31,850 --> 00:17:34,375
- I'm going down to that bakery.
- No, no, don't do it.

342
00:17:34,486 --> 00:17:36,852
Baby, what are you talking about?

343
00:17:36,955 --> 00:17:40,220
Yeah, all day long you've been busting
my apple bag about finding this girl.

344
00:17:40,325 --> 00:17:44,386
Well, I just think that
maybe she's not that into you.

345
00:17:44,496 --> 00:17:47,522
And that's why
she didn't give you her number.

346
00:17:48,667 --> 00:17:52,103
Robin, care to chime in with anything?

347
00:17:53,939 --> 00:17:55,031
Yes.

348
00:17:56,108 --> 00:17:57,166
Ted,

349
00:18:00,512 --> 00:18:01,877
go get her.

350
00:18:02,014 --> 00:18:03,572
Going. Getting!

351
00:18:03,682 --> 00:18:05,013
Ted. Oh, my gosh, I love this moment.

352
00:18:05,117 --> 00:18:06,209
You know why? 'Cause I'm gonna say it.

353
00:18:06,318 --> 00:18:07,546
And this time,
you're actually gonna say yes.

354
00:18:07,653 --> 00:18:10,315
You ready? You ready to say yes?
Ted, suit up!

355
00:18:10,422 --> 00:18:11,514
Yes!

356
00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:13,758
- No.
- Oh, come on!

357
00:18:16,228 --> 00:18:19,425
- Guess we were gone a while.
- Oh, that's too bad.

358
00:18:19,565 --> 00:18:22,295
I was looking forward to one last dance.

359
00:18:30,008 --> 00:18:31,942
<i>(MUSIC PLA YING ON CD PLA YER)</i>

360
00:18:43,522 --> 00:18:44,955
Why, yes, I am.

361
00:18:45,390 --> 00:18:47,415
Sorry, I could tell
what you were just thinking.

362
00:18:47,526 --> 00:18:49,653
Wow, what was I just thinking?

363
00:18:49,761 --> 00:18:52,059
Damn, he's looking mighty fine in that tux.

364
00:18:53,332 --> 00:18:55,698
- You got me. You are good.
- Yeah.

365
00:18:56,201 --> 00:18:58,328
You know, I don't look like this every day.

366
00:18:58,437 --> 00:19:01,497
On a real weekend, the real Ted wears
a pair of jeans and a sweatshirt

367
00:19:01,607 --> 00:19:02,972
with bleach stains on it.

368
00:19:04,176 --> 00:19:06,542
The real Ted sounds real sexy.

369
00:19:08,413 --> 00:19:11,007
It's too bad I'll never get to see it.

370
00:19:16,488 --> 00:19:18,752
Buttercup Bakery. This is it.

371
00:19:18,857 --> 00:19:21,587
Good luck, dude. Grab me a cupcake.

372
00:19:24,897 --> 00:19:27,331
Ted? You still with us?

373
00:19:40,412 --> 00:19:42,277
Tell me your last name.

374
00:19:45,784 --> 00:19:48,116
You know, there's one little flaw
in our plan.

375
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:49,619
What's that?

376
00:19:49,721 --> 00:19:52,349
I'm gonna go home tonight
with a lot of great memories,

377
00:19:52,491 --> 00:19:54,584
and one really sucky memory.

378
00:19:55,327 --> 00:19:58,057
The memory of you walking out that door.

379
00:20:01,733 --> 00:20:02,995
Hey, Ted.

380
00:20:03,268 --> 00:20:04,394
Yeah?

381
00:20:05,938 --> 00:20:09,465
Close your eyes and count to five.

382
00:20:13,478 --> 00:20:14,570
One.

383
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:16,438
Two.

384
00:20:17,449 --> 00:20:18,643
Three.

385
00:20:20,319 --> 00:20:21,411
Four.

386
00:20:23,555 --> 00:20:24,647
Five.

387
00:20:36,668 --> 00:20:40,661
<i>TED; Until our dying days, we'll remember</i>
<i>everything about that night</i>

388
00:20:40,806 --> 00:20:42,296
<i>as perfect,</i>

389
00:20:43,075 --> 00:20:45,043
Maybe we both need that.

390
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:47,474
I mean, so many things go wrong in life,

391
00:20:47,579 --> 00:20:49,410
but this is the one thing that never will.

392
00:20:49,514 --> 00:20:53,507
It will always, always be pure,

393
00:20:53,619 --> 00:20:55,644
unadulterated, awesome.

394
00:20:57,189 --> 00:20:59,817
If I walk in there, I'm robbing both of us
of what could be...

395
00:20:59,925 --> 00:21:02,587
The meter's running, dude.
Crap or get off the pot.

396
00:21:02,694 --> 00:21:04,161
Yeah, yeah, I'm going.

397
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:29,910
Oh, thank God!
