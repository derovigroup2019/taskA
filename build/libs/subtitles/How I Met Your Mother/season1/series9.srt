OLDER TED: Kids, this is
a Thanksgiving story.

00:00:18,785 --> 00:00:21,219
<i>Thanksgiving in New York</i>
<i>is a wonderful time,</i>

2
00:00:22,022 --> 00:00:26,152
<i>It's a time for giving of yourself,</i>
<i>for thinking of your fellow man,</i>

3
00:00:26,259 --> 00:00:29,854
<i>A time when the unforgiving city</i>
<i>becomes a little kinder,</i>

00:00:29,996 --> 00:00:31,759
Well, I just ralphed.

5
00:00:32,432 --> 00:00:36,027
- How much did you guys drink last night?
- Not how much, what.

6
00:00:36,503 --> 00:00:38,130
The Thanks-tini,

7
00:00:38,371 --> 00:00:41,272
a fun and delicious new novelty drink
I invented.

8
00:00:41,374 --> 00:00:45,276
Cranberry juice, potato vodka,
and a bouillon cube.

9
00:00:45,712 --> 00:00:48,237
Tastes just like a turkey dinner.

10
00:00:49,816 --> 00:00:52,307
It's like Thanksgiving in my mouth.

The shuttle's here!

14
00:01:00,727 --> 00:01:03,025
He hasn't been back home to Minnesota
since Christmas.

15
00:01:03,129 --> 00:01:05,359
- He's a little excited.
- Baby, we're holding up the shuttle.

16
00:01:05,465 --> 00:01:08,662
Do you have everything you need?
Toothbrush, pajamas, underpants?

17
00:01:08,768 --> 00:01:10,099
Underpants.

18
00:01:11,938 --> 00:01:14,930
So, Lil, Marshall's family.

19
00:01:15,241 --> 00:01:18,108
Whole weekend with the future in-laws.
You excited?

20
00:01:18,211 --> 00:01:22,511
- Yeah, no, it'll be fun.
- Lily, you just said, "Yeah, no."

21
00:01:23,516 --> 00:01:26,679
Did I? No, I love Marshall's family.

22
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:30,048
- But, yeah, no, it'll be great.
- You just did it again.

23
00:01:30,156 --> 00:01:31,783
Yeah, no, shut up.

24
00:01:33,226 --> 00:01:34,955
Wait, so you're not going home
for Thanksgiving?

25
00:01:35,061 --> 00:01:37,928
- No, I have to work on Friday. You?
- I'm Canadian, remember?

26
00:01:38,031 --> 00:01:40,864
- We celebrate Thanksgiving in October.
- Oh, right, I forgot.

27

You guys are weird.
You pronounce the word "out," "oute."

You guys are the world's leader
in handgun violence,

29
00:01:47,307 --> 00:01:48,774
your healthcare system is bankrupt,

30
00:01:48,875 --> 00:01:52,641
and your country is deeply divided
on almost every important issue.

Your cops are called Mounties.

32
00:01:58,751 --> 00:02:00,616
So, probably hanging out
with Barney, then?

33
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:02,711
No. Barney's got
his own Thanksgiving tradition.

34
00:02:03,289 --> 00:02:05,780
Thanksgiving in a strip club. Who's in?

35
00:02:05,925 --> 00:02:09,088
The Lusty Leopard has
a surprisingly good Thanksgiving buffet.

36
00:02:09,195 --> 00:02:12,096
Plus, they do this thing.
Heather dresses up as a Pilgrim,

37
00:02:12,198 --> 00:02:16,897
and Misty dresses up as an Indian,
and they share a meal together.

38
00:02:17,103 --> 00:02:21,733
- Oh, Barney.
- I'm sorry. Native American.

39
00:02:23,209 --> 00:02:25,939
I think I'm gonna go to a homeless shelter,
serve food.

40
00:02:26,045 --> 00:02:27,672
- That's awesome.
- Yeah.

41
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:31,181
I thought I'd just spend the day
giving back, you know, doing some good.

42
00:02:31,284 --> 00:02:33,377
- Canceling out Barney.
- Exactly.

43

- Where are all my underpants?
- Did you check your suitcase?

44
00:02:36,422 --> 00:02:37,389
No.

45
00:02:38,758 --> 00:02:39,325
Let's go.

00:02:39,325 --> 00:02:39,950

- Hike, hut!

- With a basketball?
- Well, it's a combination of the two.

66
00:03:28,775 --> 00:03:31,676
- We call it "bask-ice-ball."
- We invented it.

67
00:03:31,778 --> 00:03:34,372
It's the most dangerous
and awesome sport in the world.

68
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:38,211
Bask-ice-ball? Not ice-ket-ball?

69
00:03:38,318 --> 00:03:39,979
"Ice-ket-ball"?

70
00:03:40,987 --> 00:03:43,217
- Just sounds weird.
- Yeah.

71

- It's bask-ice-ball, okay? And I'm the best.
- Oh, you wish.

- What are you doing here?
- Oh, just the Lord's work.

- But you're Satan.
- Guys, okay, look.

I don't advertise it, but I volunteer here.

- Every Sunday, all year long.

to be here, Kendall.

But this is an American holiday.

Lily, now that you're going to be
a Mrs. Eriksen,

117
00:05:58,958 --> 00:06:02,018
I'm going to let you in on a secret recipe:

118
00:06:02,762 --> 00:06:06,459
The Eriksen Family Seven Layer Salad.

119
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:09,231
Seven layer salad?

120
00:06:11,537 --> 00:06:14,335
Six cups of mayonnaise?
That can't be right.

121
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:18,672
Oh, no, dear. Sixteen cups.
Mayo's in that cabinet.

122
00:06:22,014 --> 00:06:25,950
Oh, my God, there is some
serious bask-ice-ball going on out there.

123
00:06:26,052 --> 00:06:28,987
Dad totally nailed Marcus in the face
with a snowball, which is a foul,

124
00:06:29,088 --> 00:06:30,851
'cause you only get
one snowball per possession,

125
00:06:30,957 --> 00:06:34,222
so I nailed him in the shin with my skate,
and then I totally dunked it.

126
00:06:34,327 --> 00:06:37,728
Yeah, you were sitting pretty,
till I whacked you with that mallet.

127
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:39,457
Hey, gorgeous.

00:06:39,999 --> 00:06:41,364

129
00:06:41,634 --> 00:06:45,832
Yeah, but I kind of miss you.
Could you stay in here for a little bit?

130
00:06:45,938 --> 00:06:48,099
Yeah, yeah, yeah, no problem.
It's halftime.

131
00:06:48,441 --> 00:06:50,807
Halftime's over.
Get your butts out here. Come on.

And I hope you like the taste
of skate, dorko.

- Thanks, baby.

a hot, nutritious meal,

141
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:25,941
is there a better feeling on earth?

142
00:07:26,112 --> 00:07:29,673
Yesterday, you said the best feeling
on earth was getting your toes sucked.

143
00:07:29,916 --> 00:07:32,714
Then you requested a high-five,
with your foot.

144
00:07:34,487 --> 00:07:37,012
Hey, Barn, what do you say
you let us sub in for you

145
00:07:37,123 --> 00:07:39,182
scoop stuffing for a little bit?

146
00:07:39,292 --> 00:07:41,089
You wanna scoop stuffing
your first day out?

can I be quarterback this Sunday? Dude.

148
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:51,801
Okay, I finished the Gummi Bear layer
of the salad.

00:07:51,904 --> 00:07:53,303
What's next?

150
00:07:54,307 --> 00:07:56,241
Potato chips, of course.

00:07:56,476 --> 00:08:00,207
So, Lily, when are you gonna start
thinking about having a baby?

152
00:08:00,947 --> 00:08:04,940
Baby? You know,
I hadn't really thought about it.

153
00:08:05,318 --> 00:08:06,512
At all.

167
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:50,918
<i>about possibly having a 15-pound Eriksen</i>
<i>growing inside of her,</i>

168
00:08:51,831 --> 00:08:53,799
That's a big baby, Judy.

169
00:08:54,233 --> 00:08:57,532
- The doctor thought he was twins.
- (TITTERING) Twins.

170
00:08:58,871 --> 00:09:00,031
Twins.

171
00:09:03,142 --> 00:09:06,475
This is crazy. When did it get so hard
to do charity work?

172
00:09:06,579 --> 00:09:08,342
I do charity work all the time.

173
00:09:08,447 --> 00:09:10,574
Remember when I said
I'd find you a girlfriend?

174
00:09:10,683 --> 00:09:13,675
Delightful. How's that little project
coming along, anyway?

175
00:09:13,786 --> 00:09:14,844
I'm working on it.

176
00:09:14,954 --> 00:09:17,514
I'm gonna introduce you to that girl
you've been staring at.

177
00:09:17,623 --> 00:09:19,784
What? That's crazy.
I haven't been staring at any girl.

178
00:09:19,892 --> 00:09:21,484
Have you met Ted?

179
00:09:21,727 --> 00:09:25,493
Hi, I'm the aforementioned Ted,
and this is... Gone.

180
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:28,124
- I'm Amanda.
- Hi.

181
00:09:28,267 --> 00:09:32,966
- So, what do you do here, Ted?
- Well, I've been... Nothing. I do nothing.

182
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:35,498
Well, if you wanna do something,

183
00:09:35,608 --> 00:09:37,906
you and your girlfriend can help
sort through these donations.

184
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:40,103
Oh, I'm not his girlfriend.

185
00:09:40,212 --> 00:09:43,739
I used to be,
but I just wasn't enough woman for Ted,

186
00:09:43,849 --> 00:09:46,511
emotionally, or sexually.

187
00:09:47,086 --> 00:09:48,417
Oh, my God.

188
00:09:48,888 --> 00:09:52,790
So, Amanda, what do you need us to do?

189
00:09:53,459 --> 00:09:54,619
Okay, this is important.

190
00:09:54,727 --> 00:09:56,695
Go through all these boxes
of food donations,

191
00:09:56,796 --> 00:09:59,264
take out the really good stuff,
and put it into this box.

192
00:09:59,365 --> 00:10:01,424
Got it. Consider it sorted.

193
00:10:02,835 --> 00:10:03,859
Hey, we're in business.

194
00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:06,438
Hey, Barney's not gonna get
all the glory today.

195
00:10:10,943 --> 00:10:12,911
- Let's start with this one.
- Yeah.

196
00:10:14,113 --> 00:10:16,411
- Amen.
- ALL: Amen.

197
00:10:16,549 --> 00:10:18,949
Look who came to say good night.

198
00:10:19,051 --> 00:10:22,077
It's little Martin. Three months old.

199
00:10:22,622 --> 00:10:26,319
- Months? Three months?
- He's been drinking his milk.

200
00:10:26,425 --> 00:10:27,483
Oh, yeah.

201
00:10:27,593 --> 00:10:29,060
Hear, hear.

202
00:10:30,963 --> 00:10:32,954
And she's already pregnant again.

203
00:10:33,065 --> 00:10:36,159
Well, that's 'cause
those Eriksen boys' boys can swim.

204
00:10:36,268 --> 00:10:38,998
They got two tails
and a drill bit for a head.

205
00:10:40,239 --> 00:10:44,266
- Dad, you're embarrassing me.
- Don't worry about it, Son, she's cool.

206
00:10:44,377 --> 00:10:48,006
- She's gonna be an Eriksen.
- Yeah, well, not literally.

207
00:10:48,214 --> 00:10:50,842
'Cause, you know, I'm keeping my name.

208
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:53,676
But the apron?

209
00:10:56,756 --> 00:10:59,452
Well, we haven't actually decided
anything yet, so we're gonna...

210
00:10:59,558 --> 00:11:02,584
No, I've decided,
and I'm keeping my own name.

211
00:11:03,162 --> 00:11:06,029
But Eriksen is a great last name.

212
00:11:06,966 --> 00:11:09,025
People know the Eriksens.

213
00:11:10,636 --> 00:11:12,604
Well, sure, in St. Cloud,

214
00:11:12,705 --> 00:11:15,868
but our kids aren't gonna be
growing up in St. Cloud.

215
00:11:16,042 --> 00:11:17,407
Right, baby?

216
00:11:20,012 --> 00:11:23,345
Well, why not St. Cloud?
I mean, I loved growing up in St. Cloud.

217
00:11:23,449 --> 00:11:26,179
St. Cloud is a great place
to have a childhood.

218
00:11:26,285 --> 00:11:27,912
Well, so is New York.

221
00:11:33,526 --> 00:11:36,586
And we grew to the proper size,
and then we stopped.

222
00:11:43,269 --> 00:11:45,760

- Oh, that's for me.

00:11:45,871 --> 00:11:50,069
- You can put it in my car.
- In your car. Then you'll take it...

224
00:11:50,443 --> 00:11:53,970
Home. Yeah, we get so much extra food,
no one can eat it all.

225
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:57,374
Oh, truffle oil. Score.

226
00:11:58,150 --> 00:12:01,711

thinking it was going to feed the hungry.

- But, Marshall, you love New York.
- Yes, I do.

229
00:12:12,064 --> 00:12:13,497
But you always said
that when we had kids,

230
00:12:13,599 --> 00:12:17,467
- you wanted to move out of Manhattan.
- Well, yeah, to Brooklyn.

- No.

Hey, weird question.

300
00:16:45,704 --> 00:16:47,865
Why did you drive 3 miles down Route 23

301
00:16:47,973 --> 00:16:49,838
and take a pee
behind a convenience store?

302
00:16:49,942 --> 00:16:52,001
Okay, I'll tell you, but before I do,

303
00:16:52,111 --> 00:16:55,638
promise me that we are not gonna move
to St. Cloud, Minnesota. Promise.

304
00:16:55,748 --> 00:16:57,739
Look it, I'm not suggesting
that we move here tomorrow,

305
00:16:57,883 --> 00:16:59,043
- I'm just...
- Just promise!

306
00:16:59,151 --> 00:17:00,743
Why do you want me to promise you that?

307
00:17:00,853 --> 00:17:03,617
Because I don't fit in here.
I'm not 8 feet tall,

308
00:17:03,722 --> 00:17:07,158
and I don't think you can call it a salad
if it has Funyuns in it!

00:17:08,093 --> 00:17:09,458
I'm Funyuns.

310
00:17:09,928 --> 00:17:14,297
And mayonnaise, and Gummi Bears,
and bask-ice-ball, and I love St. Cloud.

311
00:17:14,433 --> 00:17:17,231
And yes, there is a part of me
that would like to move here someday.

312
00:17:17,336 --> 00:17:21,534
And why are we having this discussion
in a jail cell on Thanksgiving?

313
00:17:22,241 --> 00:17:26,610
Okay, personal effects.
One wallet, one cell phone,

314
00:17:27,546 --> 00:17:29,309
one pregnancy test.

315
00:17:37,456 --> 00:17:40,357

- Whoa.
- Yeah.

317
00:17:51,970 --> 00:17:54,336
Lily, we can't let our kids play
bask-ice-ball.

318
00:17:54,807 --> 00:17:57,469
Bask-ice-ball is really dangerous.

319
00:17:58,577 --> 00:18:00,568
Yeah, what are the rules
to that game, anyway?

320
00:18:00,679 --> 00:18:03,341
There are no rules.
We just whale on each other.

321
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:11,014
Look, I don't wanna be
exactly like my family.

322
00:18:12,958 --> 00:18:15,358
And don't take this the wrong way,

323
00:18:15,994 --> 00:18:19,395
but I don't wanna be
exactly like your family, either.

324
00:18:20,866 --> 00:18:22,800
We'll be our own family.

325
00:18:22,968 --> 00:18:27,871
And we'll find our own way to
freak out the people our kids bring home.

326
00:18:31,376 --> 00:18:33,207
Great, now I'm crying.

327
00:18:33,645 --> 00:18:37,274
Look, we may have some really
big decisions to make

328
00:18:37,382 --> 00:18:39,145
in about 10 seconds,

329
00:18:39,785 --> 00:18:42,219
but right now,
I don't care where our kids grow up,

330
00:18:42,321 --> 00:18:44,687
as long as they have you for a father.

331
00:18:48,861 --> 00:18:50,795
Gosh, I hope you're the father.

332
00:18:50,896 --> 00:18:54,093
Just a little joke to lighten up the mood.

333
00:18:59,004 --> 00:19:00,596
What does it say?

334
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:04,475
- I'm afraid to look.
- PETE: It's negative!

335
00:19:05,911 --> 00:19:07,970
Oh, thank God.

336
00:19:09,314 --> 00:19:10,611
And, hey!

337
00:19:13,285 --> 00:19:15,776
Ted, are you listening?

338
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:18,286
You're a good guy.

339
00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:20,358
Wanna know
why I have to work tomorrow?

340
00:19:20,459 --> 00:19:23,724
My firm's designing an executive lounge
for a tobacco company.

341
00:19:23,829 --> 00:19:27,265
In the fight against cancer,
I'm on the side of cancer.

342
00:19:27,499 --> 00:19:30,468
Okay, Ted. I found a way
for you to help someone, to do some good.

343
00:19:30,569 --> 00:19:33,037
This is Walter. Walter is homeless.

344
00:19:33,138 --> 00:19:36,835
- And Walter would like a lap dance.
- Are you joking?

345
00:19:36,975 --> 00:19:40,775
I never joke about the sublime art
of burlesque entertainment.

346
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:43,543
No, Barney, that's insane.

347
00:19:43,649 --> 00:19:47,176
Sir, would you like me to buy you
a ticket to the buffet?

348
00:19:47,286 --> 00:19:49,948
No, I'm stuffed.
Just the lap dance would be fine.

349
00:19:51,056 --> 00:19:52,990
Ted, Walter's been
to three shelter dinners.

350
00:19:53,091 --> 00:19:56,583
You know where he hasn't been?
To heaven with Samantha.

351
00:19:58,597 --> 00:20:01,725
Look, it's the one chance you've had
all day to help someone in need.

352
00:20:01,833 --> 00:20:03,994
Now, buy this man a lap dance.

353
00:20:04,937 --> 00:20:08,065
You said you wanted to see the look of joy
in someone's eyes.

354
00:20:08,574 --> 00:20:11,270
You know, I don't think I'm gonna watch.

355
00:20:12,911 --> 00:20:16,608
Here you go, Walter. Happy Thanksgiving.

356
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:21,042
Thank you so much. No, really. Thank you.

357
00:20:25,257 --> 00:20:27,225
Happy Thanksgiving, guys.

358
00:20:29,861 --> 00:20:32,489
Thanksgiving in November. Weird.

359
00:20:39,404 --> 00:20:41,964
<i>OLDER TED; So,</i>
<i>that was Thanksgiving 2005,</i>

360
00:20:42,107 --> 00:20:46,066
<i>To be honest, it didn't go great,</i>
<i>But life has plenty of good parts,</i>

361
00:20:46,311 --> 00:20:50,179
<i>It's the rough parts that make you thankful</i>
<i>you have people to share it with,</i>

362
00:21:08,333 --> 00:21:12,133
Hey, I saw what you did for that guy.
It was really sweet.

363
00:21:13,705 --> 00:21:16,003
- Do you want a dance?
- No, thanks.

364
00:21:17,109 --> 00:21:19,600
- Do you want some yams?
- No, thanks.

365
00:21:20,779 --> 00:21:22,804
- I'm Amber.
- I'm Ted.

366
00:21:23,749 --> 00:21:26,047
Actually, I'm Tracey.

367
00:21:27,586 --> 00:21:28,883
Still Ted.

368
00:21:29,254 --> 00:21:32,314
<i>OLDER TED; And that, kids,</i>
<i>is the true story of how I met your mother,</i>

369
00:21:32,791 --> 00:21:34,486
- BOTH: What?
- (LAUGHING) I'm kidding.

370
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,086
(LAUGHS)
