<i>OLDER TED; It was May of 2006</i>
<i>in New York City, and life was good,</i>

1
00:00:19,986 --> 00:00:22,477
<i>But everything was about to change,</i>

2
00:00:22,989 --> 00:00:25,423
So what do you think?

3
00:00:27,093 --> 00:00:28,754
Robin again?

4
00:00:29,229 --> 00:00:34,724
Ted, the universe clearly does not want
you and Robin to be together.

5
00:00:34,834 --> 00:00:37,769
Don't piss off the universe.
The universe will slap you.

6
00:00:37,871 --> 00:00:39,031
Don't you think the universe

7
00:00:39,139 --> 00:00:41,369
has more important things
to worry about than my dating life?

8
00:00:41,474 --> 00:00:45,535
Unless your dating life is the glue
holding the entire universe together.

9
00:00:45,645 --> 00:00:48,808
Whoa, chills. Anybody else get chills?

10
00:00:49,949 --> 00:00:53,146
Look, I realize we've been
down this road before,

11
00:00:53,253 --> 00:00:57,519
but the fact is, whatever I do,
it all keeps coming back to Robin.

12
00:00:57,624 --> 00:00:59,990
So I gotta do this.

13
00:01:02,562 --> 00:01:04,393
- What the hell?
- That wasn't me.

14
00:01:04,497 --> 00:01:06,328
That was the universe.

17

<i>A storm,</i>

18
00:01:13,139 --> 00:01:17,098
So Tropical Storm Willie
is gonna be with us at least until Monday.

19
00:01:17,210 --> 00:01:19,804
It's gonna rain cats and dogs, folks.

20
00:01:19,913 --> 00:01:21,778
So don't step in a poodle.

21
00:01:21,881 --> 00:01:24,372
- Sandy, Robin?
- Thanks, Lou.

22
00:01:24,484 --> 00:01:25,508
Boy, too bad.

23
00:01:25,618 --> 00:01:28,485
Our big <i>Metro News 1</i> camping trip
was gonna be this weekend.

24
00:01:28,588 --> 00:01:31,580
Yeah, but camping out in the rain?
No fun. Muddy. Yuck.

25
00:01:31,691 --> 00:01:33,283
Guess we'll have to take a rain check.

26
00:01:33,393 --> 00:01:35,554
And we'll check in
with you tomorrow, New York.

27
00:01:35,662 --> 00:01:37,152
Have a great night.

28
00:01:37,397 --> 00:01:39,058
MAN: And we're clear.

29
00:01:39,165 --> 00:01:43,158
Bummer. I was hoping to finally have sex
with you this weekend, Scherbatsky.

30
00:01:43,269 --> 00:01:46,261
Well, I'd give you the
"I don't date co-workers" speech again,

31
00:01:46,372 --> 00:01:49,273
but, God, you must have
that son-of-a-bitch memorized by now.

32
00:01:49,375 --> 00:01:52,367
Shame, though.
It was a pretty hot show tonight.

33
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:55,573
The rhythmic give and take
of our improvised banter there at the end

34
00:01:55,682 --> 00:01:57,206
really got my freak juice flowing.

35
00:01:57,350 --> 00:01:58,612

36
00:01:59,052 --> 00:02:00,076
Dude, he is right.

37
00:02:00,186 --> 00:02:02,450
How many times do you have
to watch this crash and burn

38
00:02:02,555 --> 00:02:05,752
- before you say, "Enough"?
- One more. One more time.

39
00:02:05,859 --> 00:02:08,225
One more big, beautiful, stupid,
romantic gesture

40
00:02:08,328 --> 00:02:10,956
and then, whatever she says,
yes or no, that's it.

41
00:02:11,064 --> 00:02:12,463
If it's yes, great.

42
00:02:12,565 --> 00:02:15,762
If it's no,
then I am done going after Robin forever.

43
00:02:15,869 --> 00:02:18,997
So what's this big, beautiful,
romantic gesture?

44
00:02:19,339 --> 00:02:21,204
I am going to make her

45
00:02:22,609 --> 00:02:23,940
a mix CD.

46
00:02:25,478 --> 00:02:26,843
No, I'm kidding. I got a plan.

47
00:02:26,946 --> 00:02:28,937
Lily, I'm gonna need the spare key
to Robin's apartment.

48
00:02:29,048 --> 00:02:30,481
I see where this is going.

54
00:02:44,931 --> 00:02:47,331
So this plan you speak of.

55
00:02:47,867 --> 00:02:50,358
Remember the first night
Robin and I went out?

56
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:54,031
<i>TED; I stole a blue French horn for her,</i>
<i>and it almost worked,</i>

57
00:02:54,274 --> 00:02:58,335
Yeah, dude, that was awesome.
But how are you ever gonna top that?

58
00:03:04,717 --> 00:03:07,083
She should be here any second. So...

59
00:03:07,554 --> 00:03:10,045
We're pretty hungry.
When do we get our pizza?

60
00:03:10,156 --> 00:03:11,282
Enough with the...

61
00:03:11,391 --> 00:03:13,825
We'll go get pizza later, all right?
Just stay...

- Hello?
- Hey, Lily.

68
00:03:36,416 --> 00:03:40,216
I'm locked out of my apartment.
I need to come pick up my extra key.

69
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:41,617
Extra key?

70
00:03:43,056 --> 00:03:45,115
Do I have an extra key to your apartment?

71
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:46,487
Yes, I gave it to you.

72
00:03:46,593 --> 00:03:49,494
Oh, right. That key. Yeah, I lost it.

73
00:03:50,196 --> 00:03:52,096
Great. Now I gotta go to the locksmith.

74
00:03:52,198 --> 00:03:53,495
No. Wait.

75
00:03:54,567 --> 00:03:56,364
Maybe you should just knock.

76
00:03:56,469 --> 00:03:57,629
Knock?

Robin. I've sort of said this already.

I mean, I've half-said it.
I've tried to say it and I've said it badly.

- Ted, this is so...
- I know.

I was gonna watch <i>Jeopardy,</i>

- Great.

104
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:50,677
Yeah, 'cause when we talked earlier,
you said there'd be pizza.

105
00:05:50,783 --> 00:05:54,412
No, I said I'd get you a pizza afterwards.

106
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:56,249
Look, could we talk about this later?

Sort of a big life decision.

It's not that I haven't thought about this.

00:06:32,558 --> 00:06:34,856
You know that I have.
But let's look at this, okay?

118

We only just started being friends again.

119
00:06:37,263 --> 00:06:39,458
I know. But come on.

120

And... And we want different things.
That's still there. That's not going away.

I mean, what if we do this
and it doesn't work out

122
00:06:46,305 --> 00:06:47,670
and I'd lose you as a friend?

123
00:06:48,608 --> 00:06:50,041
I gotta think about this.

124
00:06:50,143 --> 00:06:52,304
Okay, fine. Think about it on the plane.

125

- I can't go to Paris. I'm going camping.

128
00:06:58,584 --> 00:07:01,018
- Well, I thought that thing was canceled.
- Well, it's back on.

129
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:03,588
- Since when?
- Since like an hour ago.

- Oh, congratulations.
- Congratulations, yourself.

145
00:07:47,033 --> 00:07:49,297
- What do you mean?
- Well, Joe asked me

146
00:07:49,402 --> 00:07:52,337
who I thought should replace me
as lead anchor.

147
00:07:52,438 --> 00:07:53,632
I told him you.

148
00:07:54,941 --> 00:07:57,171
They're announcing it next week.
Act surprised.

149
00:07:57,810 --> 00:08:00,711
Wow. Thanks.

150
00:08:02,415 --> 00:08:03,541
And, yes.

151
00:08:03,649 --> 00:08:05,913
- Yes, what?
- Yes, let's go get dinner.

152
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:10,450
How about this weekend
on the camping trip?

153
00:08:10,556 --> 00:08:11,853
I roast a mean weenie.

00:08:14,594 --> 00:08:17,893
You're kidding me. No way.
Don't go on this thing.

155

Ted, I have to go.
It's a company camping trip.

156
00:08:20,766 --> 00:08:23,963
Really? Because it also kind of
sounds like a date with Sandy

157
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:25,128
and his weenie.

158
00:08:25,238 --> 00:08:26,398

159
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:30,169
- I mean, is this not a date?
- I don't know.

160
00:08:30,276 --> 00:08:33,973
- So, what, you actually like this guy now?
- I don't know.

161
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:36,710
- Are you gonna hook up with him?
- I don't know.

162
00:08:36,816 --> 00:08:38,647
- Yes, you do.
- No, Ted, I don't.

163
00:08:38,751 --> 00:08:40,616
And you know what? That's okay.

164
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:43,655
I don't plan out every second of my life,
like you do.

- I don't plan out every...
- Oh, really?

166

What is all of this?

167
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:51,094
I mean, why can't you just say,
"Hey, Robin, let's go get some sushi?"

168
00:08:51,197 --> 00:08:56,134
No, it has to be a string quartet,

Make this mistake.

I can't do that.

- Good hustle out there.

for three months

Marshall, I love you.

Can you promise me that
that's not gonna happen?

337
00:17:17,603 --> 00:17:19,833
- Pause.
- No, Lily, we cannot pause this anymore.

Can you promise me that

- Pause!
- Why do you want me to pause?

340
00:17:26,812 --> 00:17:29,178
That's just a great use
of the pause function, baby.

341
00:17:29,281 --> 00:17:30,578
Thank you.

Hey, Ted, what you doing?

344
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:41,526
A rain dance.

345
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:46,297
Dude, that's not a rain dance.
That's a fat kid with a bee in his pants.

346
00:17:46,398 --> 00:17:49,890
Look, I highly doubt the Great Spirit's
a stickler for choreography.

347
00:17:50,002 --> 00:17:51,902
It's the thought that counts.

Dude, these are your awesome years,
you're wasting them on this girl.

00:18:00,345 --> 00:18:03,109
- This isn't gonna work.
- Yeah. I know that.

352
00:18:03,215 --> 00:18:06,378
- Well, then why are you doing it?
- Because I love her.

353
00:18:06,485 --> 00:18:07,747
I love her!

354
00:18:07,853 --> 00:18:09,718
I told her that the first night we went out,

355
00:18:09,822 --> 00:18:12,416
and here it is, eight months later,
and nothing's changed.

356
00:18:12,524 --> 00:18:15,118
So, yes, I know this isn't gonna work.

- Why?

That's what I did today.
