1
00:00:01,983 --> 00:00:04,518
I cannot stop staring
at that girl's face.

2
00:00:04,519 --> 00:00:05,886
Face. Huh.

3
00:00:05,887 --> 00:00:08,355
That's your weirdest nickname
for boobs yet.

4
00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:09,890
No, Ted,

5
00:00:09,891 --> 00:00:11,525
I'm really looking at her face.

6
00:00:11,526 --> 00:00:13,994
Aw... that's actually
really sweet.

7
00:00:13,995 --> 00:00:15,396
Puffy cheeks,

8
00:00:15,397 --> 00:00:17,665
smudged mascara,

9
00:00:17,666 --> 00:00:19,400
slightly red nose...

10
00:00:19,401 --> 00:00:21,268
That girl was just crying.

11
00:00:21,269 --> 00:00:22,570
She's so sad

12
00:00:22,571 --> 00:00:24,071
and defenseless.

13
00:00:24,072 --> 00:00:25,573
Anyone have a condom?

14
00:00:25,574 --> 00:00:27,241
Oh! Oh, God! No, no, no!

15
00:00:27,242 --> 00:00:28,509
That's it!
You know what?

16
00:00:28,510 --> 00:00:29,777
Five-minute time-out!

17
00:00:29,778 --> 00:00:31,112
Corner booth! Now.

18
00:00:32,214 --> 00:00:33,247
Hey, get this.

19
00:00:33,248 --> 00:00:35,082
You know my friend
Max from law school?

20
00:00:35,083 --> 00:00:36,517
<i>He's at Gregor's
Steakhouse downtown,</i>

21
00:00:36,518 --> 00:00:38,686
<i>and Woody Allen is sitting
two tables over.</i>

22
00:00:38,687 --> 00:00:40,988
<i>He wants us
to come check it out.</i>

23
00:00:42,157 --> 00:00:44,024
I don't know, it could be cool.

24
00:00:44,025 --> 00:00:45,559
I've never seen Woody Allen.

25
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:47,628
What?! Robin, how can
you be a New Yorker

26
00:00:47,629 --> 00:00:50,064
and never have seen Woody Allen?
I have seen

27
00:00:50,065 --> 00:00:52,433
plenty of other famous people.

28
00:00:52,434 --> 00:00:55,970
Last week I saw... Maury Povich.

29
00:00:55,971 --> 00:00:58,572
<i>Kids, you know talk
show host Maury Povich.</i>

30
00:00:58,573 --> 00:01:01,809
<i>It was uncanny
how often we saw this guy.</i>

31
00:01:01,810 --> 00:01:03,277
Dude, everyone sees
Maury Povich.

32
00:01:03,278 --> 00:01:05,045
Maury Povich is everywhere.

33
00:01:05,046 --> 00:01:06,247
I'm sorry, Robin, but you're

34
00:01:06,248 --> 00:01:07,348
not a real New Yorker

35
00:01:07,349 --> 00:01:08,582
until you've seen Woody Allen.

36
00:01:08,583 --> 00:01:10,584
I am, too, a real New Yorker.

37
00:01:10,585 --> 00:01:11,852
That's adorable.

38
00:01:11,853 --> 00:01:13,554
You're from Canada.

39
00:01:13,555 --> 00:01:14,989
I have been here
for almost six years.

40
00:01:14,990 --> 00:01:16,724
It's not like
I just got off a boat.

41
00:01:16,725 --> 00:01:17,791
A boat!

42
00:01:17,792 --> 00:01:20,995
<i>Oh, wait, that is
how you say it.</i>

43
00:01:20,996 --> 00:01:23,097
I'd say you're not a real New
Yorker until you've stolen a cab

44
00:01:23,098 --> 00:01:24,732
from someone who needs it
more than you do.

45
00:01:24,733 --> 00:01:27,768
No, you're not a real New Yorker
till you've cried on the subway

46
00:01:27,769 --> 00:01:29,537
and not given a damn
what anyone thinks.

47
00:01:29,538 --> 00:01:31,105
No, you're not
a real New Yorker

48
00:01:31,106 --> 00:01:33,107
until you've killed a cockroach
with your bare hands.

49
00:01:33,108 --> 00:01:34,909
Those rules
are all stupid, okay?

50
00:01:34,910 --> 00:01:37,011
I've never done
any of those things.

51
00:01:37,012 --> 00:01:38,345
<i>By the end of this day,</i>

52
00:01:38,346 --> 00:01:40,781
<i>Robin would have done
all of those things.</i>

53
00:01:40,782 --> 00:01:41,649
Okay, time's up.

54
00:01:41,650 --> 00:01:43,117
What are we talking about?

55
00:01:43,118 --> 00:01:44,418
Woody Allen is
eating at Gregor's,

56
00:01:44,419 --> 00:01:46,487
and Robin thinks that
we should go see him.

57
00:01:46,488 --> 00:01:47,488
Why would I do that?

58
00:01:47,489 --> 00:01:48,956
I'll see him at
poker on Tuesday.

59
00:01:48,957 --> 00:01:50,724
Oh, come on,
if we jump in a cab,

60
00:01:50,725 --> 00:01:51,959
we'll be there in 15 minutes.

61
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:53,727
A real New Yorker would
know the subway's faster.

62
00:01:53,728 --> 00:01:55,796
You just take the one,
and transfer to the two-three.

63
00:01:55,797 --> 00:01:57,932
Well, the bus runs
more often on weekends.

64
00:01:57,933 --> 00:01:59,300
Take the M-7 to the M-5.

65
00:01:59,301 --> 00:02:01,402
The bus? Every time
I take the bus,

66
00:02:01,403 --> 00:02:04,305
there is one crazy person
no one wants to sit near.

67
00:02:04,306 --> 00:02:06,407
That's why I have
never taken the bus.

68
00:02:06,408 --> 00:02:07,575
Plus...

69
00:02:07,576 --> 00:02:10,211
<i>I can run faster
than a bus.</i>

70
00:02:10,212 --> 00:02:12,546
Dude, that's, like, seven miles.

71
00:02:12,547 --> 00:02:14,048
You can't do that.

72
00:02:14,049 --> 00:02:16,517
You can't beat the bus!
I can beat

73
00:02:16,518 --> 00:02:19,220
a bus or a cab or a train!

74
00:02:19,221 --> 00:02:22,289
Is anyone else suddenly
craving green eggs and ham?

75
00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:25,593
Machines are overrated, and someone
needs to take them down a peg.

76
00:02:25,594 --> 00:02:28,862
You're all wrong... I got a way to get
there so fast, I could beat all of you,

77
00:02:28,863 --> 00:02:29,697
even if I

78
00:02:29,698 --> 00:02:30,864
sat down and ordered

79
00:02:30,865 --> 00:02:32,333
a big, juicy steak first.

80
00:02:32,334 --> 00:02:33,033
How?

81
00:02:33,034 --> 00:02:34,034
Medium rare.

82
00:02:34,035 --> 00:02:35,369
But that's not
important right now.

83
00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:37,438
Look, I know the city better
than any of you guys, okay?

84
00:02:37,439 --> 00:02:38,906
Oh, my God!
Oh, wow!

85
00:02:40,408 --> 00:02:42,710
All right, all right,
hold on, hold on!

86
00:02:42,711 --> 00:02:44,144
Let's just forget about it.

87
00:02:44,145 --> 00:02:46,180
Who cares?
I mean, there's no way

88
00:02:46,181 --> 00:02:48,682
to find out who's right anyway.

89
00:02:51,453 --> 00:02:52,753
First person there wins!

90
00:02:52,754 --> 00:02:54,455
Doesn't matter
how you get there!

91
00:02:54,456 --> 00:02:56,257
Stay sad!
I'll be back!

92
00:02:56,457 --> 00:03:06,657
Sync by InSUBs
www.addic7ed.com

93
00:03:23,388 --> 00:03:26,123
Hi. Can I see
a menu, please?

94
00:03:26,124 --> 00:03:27,824
No rush.

95
00:03:32,463 --> 00:03:34,264
<i>Kids, I should tell you,</i>

96
00:03:34,265 --> 00:03:36,466
<i>Lily really needed
a win that day.</i>

97
00:03:38,403 --> 00:03:40,704
<i>When Marshall and Lily
decided to have a baby,</i>

98
00:03:40,705 --> 00:03:42,572
<i>they assumed it
would happen right away.</i>

99
00:03:42,573 --> 00:03:43,907
It's gonna be positive.

100
00:03:43,908 --> 00:03:45,442
Eriksen man are hella fertile.

101
00:03:45,443 --> 00:03:48,078
When Uncle Morris was 16,
he got his girlfriend pregnant

102
00:03:48,079 --> 00:03:51,415
just by holding her hand too
tight in the backseat of a car.

103
00:03:51,416 --> 00:03:54,451
Now I'm thinking my
parents lied to me.

104
00:03:54,452 --> 00:03:55,719
Negative.

105
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:57,220
<i>As the weeks went by,</i>

106
00:03:57,221 --> 00:03:59,389
<i>Marshall's confidence
never wavered.</i>

107
00:03:59,390 --> 00:04:01,858
<i>Then it started to mess
with Lily's head.</i>

108
00:04:02,994 --> 00:04:05,262
Negative?

109
00:04:05,263 --> 00:04:07,364
<i>Well, we know it's not me.</i>

110
00:04:07,365 --> 00:04:08,432
Everything's fine.

111
00:04:08,433 --> 00:04:10,701
These things take time.

112
00:04:10,702 --> 00:04:11,868
Not with an Eriksen.

113
00:04:11,869 --> 00:04:15,172
<i>Something must
be wrong with you.</i>

114
00:04:15,173 --> 00:04:17,908
Also, my mom hates you.

115
00:04:17,909 --> 00:04:19,476
You know what?

116
00:04:19,477 --> 00:04:22,279
Just to make sure,
I'm gonna pee on this again.

117
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:23,647
What?

118
00:04:23,648 --> 00:04:24,715
No, you wouldn't.

119
00:04:24,716 --> 00:04:26,083
Somebody help me!

120
00:04:26,084 --> 00:04:28,919
Somebody help me!

121
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:32,122
<i>Lily was so fed up
with not getting anywhere,</i>

122
00:04:32,123 --> 00:04:35,058
<i>maybe winning this race
was just what she needed.</i>

123
00:04:46,838 --> 00:04:48,638
Idiot!

124
00:04:49,974 --> 00:04:51,541
<i>I'll show them.</i>

125
00:04:51,542 --> 00:04:53,877
<i>My body can outrun
any motorized vehicle.</i>

126
00:04:53,878 --> 00:04:57,080
<i>I'm like John Henry
when he beat the steam engine.</i>

127
00:04:57,081 --> 00:04:59,883
<i>All I need is
a great folk song.</i>

128
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:11,595
 Of a man who dared
to race machines

129
00:05:13,397 --> 00:05:14,631
Suck it, Grand-butt!

130
00:05:22,073 --> 00:05:23,740
Ooh, taxi!

131
00:05:27,178 --> 00:05:29,746
Excuse me, I got a thing.

132
00:05:31,349 --> 00:05:34,651
Maury... Maury...

133
00:05:37,355 --> 00:05:39,356
Track maintenance?

134
00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:44,561
20-minute delay?

135
00:05:44,562 --> 00:05:45,529
How do you do that?

136
00:05:45,530 --> 00:05:47,697
I grew up here;
I speak conductor.

137
00:05:47,698 --> 00:05:48,965
Damn it!

138
00:05:53,404 --> 00:05:56,907
Damn it!

139
00:05:59,777 --> 00:06:03,146
<i>Kids, I also
needed a win that day.</i>

140
00:06:05,016 --> 00:06:06,983
<i>A couple nights earlier,
your Uncle Marshall</i>

141
00:06:06,984 --> 00:06:09,286
<i>had offhandedly mentioned
a Web site called...</i>

142
00:06:09,287 --> 00:06:10,987
Grademyteacher.net?

143
00:06:10,988 --> 00:06:13,123
It's this awesome site
where students can go say

144
00:06:13,124 --> 00:06:14,758
what they really think
about their professors.

145
00:06:14,759 --> 00:06:16,560
Hey, you're probably on there.

146
00:06:18,796 --> 00:06:22,265
<i>I couldn't help but see what my
students had written about me.</i>

147
00:06:22,266 --> 00:06:24,768
<i>And it was...</i>

148
00:06:26,637 --> 00:06:28,872
<i>...majestic.</i>

149
00:06:30,741 --> 00:06:32,475
<i>Until...</i>

150
00:06:36,414 --> 00:06:38,815
<i>Now, kids, I knew
I was a good professor.</i>

151
00:06:38,816 --> 00:06:40,851
<i>That's why I didn't
let it bother me.</i>

152
00:06:40,852 --> 00:06:42,552
<i>I had nothing to prove.</i>

153
00:06:42,553 --> 00:06:44,421
<i>Absolutely nothing.</i>

154
00:06:44,422 --> 00:06:45,889
Here's a fun fact.

155
00:06:45,890 --> 00:06:47,557
See the Alberta
Building over there?

156
00:06:47,558 --> 00:06:50,794
Oh. The brown one or the gray one?
That's the gray one.

157
00:06:50,795 --> 00:06:52,329
Did you know

158
00:06:52,330 --> 00:06:54,764
that in 18...

159
00:07:06,477 --> 00:07:08,812
Hey!

160
00:07:08,813 --> 00:07:10,313
Come on!

161
00:07:19,123 --> 00:07:20,690
Elizabeth!

162
00:07:22,994 --> 00:07:25,295
Somebody call an ambulance!

163
00:07:29,767 --> 00:07:32,002
Excuse me, I've got a thing.
Hey!

164
00:07:32,003 --> 00:07:34,504
That's my cab!
Gregor's Steakhouse, downtown.

165
00:07:37,141 --> 00:07:39,042
This is my cab...!

166
00:07:40,845 --> 00:07:42,145
Downtown hospital, please.

167
00:07:42,146 --> 00:07:43,980
It's right by
Gregor's Steakhouse.

168
00:07:43,981 --> 00:07:46,449
Take the FDR, and maybe
crank up some smooth jazz.

169
00:07:46,450 --> 00:07:49,920
<i>Uh, we're required by law to take
you to the nearest hospital,</i>

170
00:07:49,921 --> 00:07:51,554
which is St.
Luke's-Roosevelt.

171
00:07:51,555 --> 00:07:54,024
Uptown.

172
00:07:54,025 --> 00:07:55,325
Oh, no.

173
00:07:58,930 --> 00:08:01,598
It's my cab! This is my cab!

174
00:08:05,695 --> 00:08:07,362
It's Barney.

175
00:08:07,363 --> 00:08:08,864
Help me.

176
00:08:13,302 --> 00:08:15,404
<i>Robin also needed
a win that day.</i>

177
00:08:17,306 --> 00:08:19,341
<i>It had been
a rough year for Robin.</i>

178
00:08:19,342 --> 00:08:21,676
<i>First her boyfriend
and former cohost, Don,</i>

179
00:08:21,677 --> 00:08:23,011
<i>left her for another job.</i>

180
00:08:23,012 --> 00:08:25,714
<i>Then Robin met
her new cohost, Becky.</i>

181
00:08:25,715 --> 00:08:27,516
Hi! I'm Becky!

182
00:08:27,517 --> 00:08:28,483
Hi.

183
00:08:28,484 --> 00:08:30,585
I am so excited
to be your coanchor!

184
00:08:30,586 --> 00:08:32,821
Yay!

185
00:08:32,822 --> 00:08:34,956
Hi, Becky.
My, you're perky.

186
00:08:34,957 --> 00:08:38,660
Don't worry, I am not here
to step on your toesies.

187
00:08:38,661 --> 00:08:39,394
Oh...

188
00:08:39,395 --> 00:08:41,063
You're still the star.

189
00:08:41,064 --> 00:08:44,332
I made chocolate chip
cookies for everybody!

190
00:08:44,333 --> 00:08:45,667
Yay!

191
00:08:45,668 --> 00:08:47,669
<i>And just like that,</i>

192
00:08:47,670 --> 00:08:50,138
Becky started to eclipse Robin.

193
00:08:50,139 --> 00:08:53,308
I mean, literally eclipse her.

194
00:08:56,479 --> 00:08:58,947
This is my cab! Aah!

195
00:08:59,816 --> 00:09:01,817
Keep it.

196
00:09:08,224 --> 00:09:09,825
Hello.

197
00:09:09,826 --> 00:09:11,793
Ranjit, take me to Gregor's.

198
00:09:11,794 --> 00:09:14,362
Taking you to Gregor's.

199
00:09:14,363 --> 00:09:16,364
 As Marshall ran
with all his might

200
00:09:16,365 --> 00:09:18,100
 And passed his friend
Christine

201
00:09:18,101 --> 00:09:19,201
Hey, Christine.

202
00:09:20,937 --> 00:09:23,672
 That he had beaten
the machine

203
00:09:25,508 --> 00:09:26,575
Yes!

204
00:09:28,244 --> 00:09:30,679
Yes!

205
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:32,647
 He brought the jukebox
back to life

206
00:09:34,817 --> 00:09:36,718
Hey...!
Oh!

207
00:09:43,126 --> 00:09:44,693
Ow. Ow.

208
00:09:44,694 --> 00:09:45,794
Ow.

209
00:09:45,795 --> 00:09:47,062
Last seat.

210
00:09:47,063 --> 00:09:48,296
Thank God.

211
00:09:48,297 --> 00:09:51,032
I just had the worst
cab ride of my life.

212
00:09:51,033 --> 00:09:53,168
Well, you're in luck.

213
00:09:53,169 --> 00:09:55,303
See that gothic
church over there?

214
00:09:55,304 --> 00:09:59,608
Those Corinthian columns were
designed by Giuseppe Pegatto in 1896.

215
00:09:59,609 --> 00:10:01,843
Ow. Ow.

216
00:10:01,844 --> 00:10:03,078
Ow.

217
00:10:03,079 --> 00:10:04,546
Hey, Ranjit, pull over.

218
00:10:04,547 --> 00:10:05,881
Pulling over.

219
00:10:07,583 --> 00:10:08,617
Hey, toots!

220
00:10:08,618 --> 00:10:10,285
How about a ride?

221
00:10:13,556 --> 00:10:16,391
Oh. Hey, Robin, it's you.

222
00:10:26,335 --> 00:10:27,502
See that over there?

223
00:10:27,503 --> 00:10:28,904
That's the old Arcadian Hotel.

224
00:10:28,905 --> 00:10:31,673
Fun fact... while today
its neoclassical fenestration

225
00:10:31,674 --> 00:10:33,375
is considered to be...

226
00:10:37,313 --> 00:10:40,115
So, is this ride your way
of apologizing for this morning?

227
00:10:40,116 --> 00:10:42,150
I'm sorry.
I never apologize.

228
00:10:42,151 --> 00:10:43,885
And why would I?

229
00:10:43,886 --> 00:10:45,287
Are you kidding me?

230
00:10:45,288 --> 00:10:47,489
Hey, Barney, can I talk to you?

231
00:10:47,490 --> 00:10:50,091
Sure. Stand a little more
this way.

232
00:10:50,092 --> 00:10:52,194
I'm scouting some talent.

233
00:10:52,195 --> 00:10:54,296
Pretend we're talking
about something important.

234
00:10:54,297 --> 00:10:56,698
Oh, well, this... this
is something important.

235
00:10:56,699 --> 00:10:58,867
Um, I'm having a... a
really rough time at work.

236
00:10:58,868 --> 00:11:00,468
You know, the whole
Becky thing...

237
00:11:00,469 --> 00:11:01,736
Oh, you know what?

238
00:11:01,737 --> 00:11:02,938
That's just getting distracting.

239
00:11:02,939 --> 00:11:06,074
Um, say "carrots and peas."
Carrots and peas.

240
00:11:06,075 --> 00:11:06,975
Carrots and peas.

241
00:11:06,976 --> 00:11:08,009
Carrots and peas.

242
00:11:08,010 --> 00:11:10,879
Carrots and peas.

243
00:11:12,548 --> 00:11:15,050
Guys, I can't stop staring
at that girl's face.

244
00:11:15,051 --> 00:11:17,586
What, you really had something
to talk about? Yes.

245
00:11:17,587 --> 00:11:20,388
Look, I've spent the last
six years in this city,

246
00:11:20,389 --> 00:11:22,424
focusing on my career,
all for nothing.

247
00:11:22,425 --> 00:11:24,192
Some lady almost got me killed.

248
00:11:24,193 --> 00:11:26,228
Maury Povich stole my cab.

249
00:11:26,229 --> 00:11:28,597
I swear, this city
is starting to reject me

250
00:11:28,598 --> 00:11:30,232
like a bad organ transplant.

251
00:11:30,233 --> 00:11:33,301
You know, everyone keeps saying
that I'm not a real New Yorker.

252
00:11:33,302 --> 00:11:36,171
Well, maybe I should
just stop trying.

253
00:11:36,172 --> 00:11:37,772
Robin, I had no idea.

254
00:11:37,773 --> 00:11:40,041
No, it's my fault for thinking
that you might care.

255
00:11:40,042 --> 00:11:41,243
Ranjit, stop the car.

256
00:11:41,244 --> 00:11:42,777
Stopping the car.

257
00:11:42,778 --> 00:11:43,745
No, don't stop the car.

258
00:11:43,746 --> 00:11:45,447
Not stopping the car.

259
00:11:45,448 --> 00:11:46,348
Seriously, stop the car.

260
00:11:46,349 --> 00:11:48,250
Seriously stopping the car.

261
00:11:48,251 --> 00:11:49,284
Look, you...

262
00:11:49,285 --> 00:11:50,752
Wait, wait...
Robin, hold on.

263
00:11:50,753 --> 00:11:53,121
If you want to talk,
I'm right here.

264
00:11:53,122 --> 00:11:54,990
Carrots and peas.

265
00:11:54,991 --> 00:11:56,725
Don't...

266
00:11:56,726 --> 00:11:57,959
You...

267
00:11:59,929 --> 00:12:03,498
I'll crank up the smooth jazz.

268
00:12:06,068 --> 00:12:08,703
 Our hero's strength
was fading fast

269
00:12:19,282 --> 00:12:20,782
 He then thought back

270
00:12:24,987 --> 00:12:27,589
Come on, Playboy Channel.

271
00:12:30,126 --> 00:12:31,493
Ow!

272
00:12:31,494 --> 00:12:33,061
 But the stapler's
mighty sting...

273
00:12:34,163 --> 00:12:35,897
Come on, Spice Channel.

274
00:12:35,898 --> 00:12:39,267
 The cable box's bite again...

275
00:12:54,083 --> 00:12:55,350
...uses a hybrid
steel tube structure...

276
00:12:55,351 --> 00:12:57,686
<i>Kids, that day, I had
a horrible realization.</i>

277
00:12:57,687 --> 00:13:01,189
<i>If you can't spot the crazy
person on the bus...</i>

278
00:13:04,026 --> 00:13:06,828
<i>...it's you.</i>

279
00:13:11,801 --> 00:13:13,868
<i>The good news is,
I was halfway there,</i>

280
00:13:13,869 --> 00:13:15,136
<i>and nothing could stop me.</i>

281
00:13:21,277 --> 00:13:24,412
Whoa!

282
00:13:24,413 --> 00:13:25,580
This is crazy.

283
00:13:25,581 --> 00:13:26,614
I can't believe it.

284
00:13:26,615 --> 00:13:28,116
Okay, this is clearly a sign.

285
00:13:28,117 --> 00:13:30,285
Let's just call it a tie.

286
00:13:30,286 --> 00:13:31,653
Forget about the race.

287
00:13:31,654 --> 00:13:32,721
Head back to the bar.

288
00:13:32,722 --> 00:13:33,655
Absolutely.

289
00:13:44,062 --> 00:13:46,664
<i>The race was back on.</i>

290
00:13:47,966 --> 00:13:50,468
Idiot.

291
00:13:50,469 --> 00:13:53,471
<i>One subway car over...</i>

292
00:14:09,588 --> 00:14:12,223
Oh, God.

293
00:14:18,096 --> 00:14:19,163
Oh, bite me!

294
00:14:23,301 --> 00:14:25,770
Faster. Mush! Mush!

295
00:14:25,771 --> 00:14:28,272
I need this win.
I need this win.

296
00:14:31,042 --> 00:14:33,010
And firing half my department
freed up the money

297
00:14:33,011 --> 00:14:34,445
to double my own salary.

298
00:14:34,446 --> 00:14:37,148
And this chick from Boston was
wicked hot in bed last night,

299
00:14:37,149 --> 00:14:38,616
and I'm getting more muscular,

300
00:14:38,617 --> 00:14:39,950
even though I've
stopped working out,

301
00:14:39,951 --> 00:14:41,652
and I've got this
amazing poker group.

302
00:14:41,653 --> 00:14:44,522
<i>Actually,
Barney did not need a win.</i>

303
00:14:44,523 --> 00:14:48,192
And I smell incredible.
Smell me.

304
00:14:48,193 --> 00:14:51,328
Just, seriously, smell me.

305
00:14:53,498 --> 00:14:55,966
<i>He did smell incredible.</i>

306
00:14:55,967 --> 00:14:57,234
Stop!

307
00:14:57,235 --> 00:14:59,403
Too slow. Switch.

308
00:15:13,785 --> 00:15:15,152
Sweetie?

309
00:15:15,153 --> 00:15:16,120
Are you okay?

310
00:15:16,121 --> 00:15:17,087
No.

311
00:15:17,088 --> 00:15:20,024
I am done with this city.
It wins.

312
00:15:20,025 --> 00:15:22,560
I just want to move
somewhere new and start over.

313
00:15:23,595 --> 00:15:26,730
You've had a rough year.

314
00:15:26,731 --> 00:15:28,599
But you're tough.

315
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:30,534
And I love you like crazy.

316
00:15:30,535 --> 00:15:32,670
If you left, I'd
have to follow you.

317
00:15:32,671 --> 00:15:34,405
And Marshall would follow me.

318
00:15:34,406 --> 00:15:35,606
And Ted would follow him.

319
00:15:35,607 --> 00:15:38,809
The only upside is that we
might get rid of Barney.

320
00:15:40,245 --> 00:15:42,179
Bring it in.

321
00:15:45,083 --> 00:15:46,684
What did he say?

322
00:15:46,685 --> 00:15:48,219
No clue.

323
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:51,555
Hey, is that Maury Povich?

324
00:15:54,659 --> 00:15:56,060
Hey! Lily.

325
00:15:57,062 --> 00:15:58,062
Sorry, sweetie.

326
00:15:58,063 --> 00:15:59,263
I swear I'll be a great friend

327
00:15:59,264 --> 00:16:01,232
at the finish line,
but the conductor just said

328
00:16:01,233 --> 00:16:02,967
you're going express
to Borough Hall,

329
00:16:02,968 --> 00:16:04,735
which means you're screwed,
sweetie.

330
00:16:04,736 --> 00:16:05,870
So long, sucker.

331
00:16:10,508 --> 00:16:12,243
Bring it in.

332
00:16:12,244 --> 00:16:13,944
Damn it.

333
00:16:15,847 --> 00:16:18,382
Hey, it's Lily.
Help me.

334
00:16:18,383 --> 00:16:21,252
And not a single passenger
would listen to me.

335
00:16:21,253 --> 00:16:22,720
I mean, am I a bad teacher?

336
00:16:22,721 --> 00:16:25,256
Do I just put people to sleep?

337
00:16:26,391 --> 00:16:27,424
Buddy?

338
00:16:27,425 --> 00:16:28,993
Hey, buddy?

339
00:16:28,994 --> 00:16:30,728
Need a hand?

340
00:16:32,163 --> 00:16:33,898
The machines have won!

341
00:16:33,899 --> 00:16:36,433
The machines have won.

342
00:16:36,434 --> 00:16:37,902
Dude, mellow.

343
00:16:39,604 --> 00:16:41,538
I can't do it.
I can't run that far.

344
00:16:41,539 --> 00:16:43,340
I can't outrace anything.

345
00:16:43,341 --> 00:16:45,309
I-I can't...

346
00:16:45,310 --> 00:16:47,945
I can't get my wife pregnant!

347
00:16:51,149 --> 00:16:52,549
Wait.

348
00:16:52,550 --> 00:16:54,885
Is that what this whole stupid
running thing has been about?

349
00:16:54,886 --> 00:16:57,688
My body has been letting me
down, and I just wanted

350
00:16:57,689 --> 00:16:59,390
to prove that it could still
do something,

351
00:16:59,391 --> 00:17:00,591
but it can't.

352
00:17:00,592 --> 00:17:02,426
Dude, you've been trying
for two months,

353
00:17:02,427 --> 00:17:04,361
not two years.
That's nothing.

354
00:17:04,362 --> 00:17:05,763
Well, you should talk.

355
00:17:05,764 --> 00:17:07,398
You know, you're the one
who's freaking out

356
00:17:07,399 --> 00:17:08,832
because you have
one mediocre review

357
00:17:08,833 --> 00:17:10,768
and, like, 50 great ones.

358
00:17:10,769 --> 00:17:12,403
64. But whatever.

359
00:17:12,404 --> 00:17:14,638
And you're designing
a frickin' building.

360
00:17:14,639 --> 00:17:16,106
I mean, come on, dude.

361
00:17:16,107 --> 00:17:19,043
Sounds like you guys
need to clear everything,

362
00:17:19,044 --> 00:17:21,545
subtract the negativity,

363
00:17:21,546 --> 00:17:24,381
and add some perspective.

364
00:17:26,785 --> 00:17:29,086
Marshall!

365
00:17:29,087 --> 00:17:31,588
Marshall, get in!

366
00:17:31,589 --> 00:17:33,757
Hello.

367
00:17:49,541 --> 00:17:51,141
There it is.

368
00:17:51,142 --> 00:17:52,242
Where are Marshall and Lily?

369
00:17:52,243 --> 00:17:54,178
Who cares?

370
00:18:17,635 --> 00:18:20,237
I won? I won!

371
00:18:20,238 --> 00:18:21,505
No!

372
00:18:21,506 --> 00:18:22,373
I can't believe I won!

373
00:18:22,374 --> 00:18:24,008
How did that even happen?

374
00:18:24,009 --> 00:18:25,142
<i>Here's how it happened.</i>

375
00:18:25,143 --> 00:18:27,344
Okay, he's in. Go.
Go. Gun it.

376
00:18:27,345 --> 00:18:29,013
Ted is in the way.
Run him over.

377
00:18:29,014 --> 00:18:30,147
Running him over.

378
00:18:30,148 --> 00:18:31,682
No. Lily, what the hell
is the matter with you?

379
00:18:31,683 --> 00:18:34,451
Nothing. I just want
to win this really badly.

380
00:18:34,452 --> 00:18:37,955
So badly that I just ditched
my best friend

381
00:18:37,956 --> 00:18:39,356
when she needed me.

382
00:18:39,357 --> 00:18:42,960
Oh, baby, you were also going
to run over Ted.

383
00:18:42,961 --> 00:18:46,163
Why did I get so crazy
about this?

384
00:18:46,164 --> 00:18:48,098
Maybe for the same reason
that I kept saying

385
00:18:48,099 --> 00:18:49,500
that I could run seven miles.

386
00:18:49,501 --> 00:18:53,470
I... I'm trying to be really,
um, confident and positive

387
00:18:53,471 --> 00:18:56,340
about all this, but, baby,
I'm really scared

388
00:18:56,341 --> 00:18:57,374
that we're not pregnant yet.

389
00:18:57,375 --> 00:18:58,642
Oh, thank God.

390
00:18:58,643 --> 00:19:01,078
I keep thinking there's
something wrong with me.

391
00:19:01,079 --> 00:19:02,646
I keep thinking there's
something wrong with me.

392
00:19:02,647 --> 00:19:03,881
It's only been two months.

393
00:19:03,882 --> 00:19:04,982
We are crazy.

394
00:19:04,983 --> 00:19:05,949
We're totally crazy.

395
00:19:05,950 --> 00:19:07,084
This is the last time

396
00:19:07,085 --> 00:19:08,986
it's ever going
to be just the two of us.

397
00:19:08,987 --> 00:19:09,887
Shouldn't we be enjoying that?

398
00:19:09,888 --> 00:19:12,289
We gotta go back to Paris.

399
00:19:12,290 --> 00:19:13,490
And take ballroom dancing.

400
00:19:13,491 --> 00:19:14,658
And really learn how to ski.

401
00:19:14,659 --> 00:19:16,860
Not just up and get faced
in the lodge.

402
00:19:16,861 --> 00:19:19,630
And see Coney Island.
I've still never been.

403
00:19:19,631 --> 00:19:21,899
See, we have a whole bucket list
of things to do

404
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:22,933
before we start having kids.

405
00:19:22,934 --> 00:19:25,602
Oh, a cradle list.

406
00:19:25,603 --> 00:19:27,771
I'm...

407
00:19:27,772 --> 00:19:30,641
so glad we're trying, and I'm
going to be really excited

408
00:19:30,642 --> 00:19:33,777
for when it happens,
but this isn't a race.

409
00:19:33,778 --> 00:19:37,381
This isn't a race.

410
00:19:37,382 --> 00:19:39,450
Ranjit, screw Gregor's.

411
00:19:39,451 --> 00:19:41,185
Let's go to Coney Island.

412
00:19:41,186 --> 00:19:44,555
Screwing Gregor's.
Going to Coney Island.

413
00:19:44,556 --> 00:19:47,357
<i>As for how Robin beat
me and Barney,</i>

414
00:19:47,358 --> 00:19:50,527
<i>to this day, your uncle
Barney won't admit it...</i>

415
00:19:50,528 --> 00:19:52,863
<i>Who cares?
But here's what I saw:</i>

416
00:19:52,864 --> 00:19:55,432
<i>I saw Barney
notice Robin's face...</i>

417
00:19:55,433 --> 00:19:58,368
<i>and maybe realize something.</i>

418
00:19:58,369 --> 00:19:59,636
<i>Barney says he tripped,</i>

419
00:19:59,637 --> 00:20:04,641
<i>but it sure felt like
he tackled me on purpose.</i>

420
00:20:04,642 --> 00:20:05,876
<i>And when Robin won,</i>

421
00:20:05,877 --> 00:20:07,478
<i>I could have sworn
I saw him smile.</i>

422
00:20:07,479 --> 00:20:09,713
I won!
No!

423
00:20:09,714 --> 00:20:11,615
So I said, "The
cab, of course""

424
00:20:13,751 --> 00:20:15,652
I know what you did back there.

425
00:20:16,287 --> 00:20:17,621
Yeah.

426
00:20:17,622 --> 00:20:19,189
Check it.

427
00:20:19,190 --> 00:20:22,526
I just drove
a pedicab 26 blocks,

428
00:20:22,527 --> 00:20:24,761
and I still smell incredible.

429
00:20:24,762 --> 00:20:26,029
Smell me.

430
00:20:26,030 --> 00:20:26,930
I'm not gonna...

431
00:20:26,931 --> 00:20:28,532
Not gonna...
Smell me.

432
00:20:29,534 --> 00:20:31,168
<i>He did smell incredible.</i>

433
00:20:31,169 --> 00:20:32,336
Wait a minute.

434
00:20:32,337 --> 00:20:33,871
So, where is Woody Allen?

435
00:20:33,872 --> 00:20:36,140
He's right there.

436
00:20:39,043 --> 00:20:41,745
Damn it, Max.
That's Maury Povich.

437
00:20:41,746 --> 00:20:44,014
I always get those two confused.

438
00:20:45,517 --> 00:20:47,885
<i>Technically, there was only
one winner that day.</i>

439
00:20:47,886 --> 00:20:51,121
<i>And in that race, everyone
found exactly what they needed.</i>

440
00:20:51,122 --> 00:20:52,556
<i>It's true,</i>

441
00:20:52,557 --> 00:20:53,757
<i>she wouldn't see Woody Allen</i>

442
00:20:53,758 --> 00:20:54,825
<i>for another couple months,</i>

443
00:20:54,826 --> 00:20:56,560
<i>but that's how Robin became,</i>

444
00:20:56,561 --> 00:20:59,596
<i>by just about any definition
of the term...</i>

445
00:21:01,566 --> 00:21:03,100
<i>...a real New Yorker.</i>

446
