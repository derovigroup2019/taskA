1
00:00:01,434 --> 00:00:03,402
<i>Kids, in the fall of 2010...</i>

2
00:00:03,503 --> 00:00:07,337
<i>it seemed like Aunt Lily could</i>
<i>only talk about one thing... babies.</i>

3
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:10,204
Oh, God.
I have been craving this burger all day.

4
00:00:10,310 --> 00:00:13,677
Do you know what plays a huge role
in helping a woman conceive?

5
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:15,304
- Mmm.
- Cervical mucus.

6
00:00:15,415 --> 00:00:17,406
Oh, God.

7
00:00:17,517 --> 00:00:20,145
Oh, my God. I can't wait to see this movie.
I hear it's really scary.

8
00:00:20,253 --> 00:00:21,880
Oh, change of plans.

9
00:00:21,988 --> 00:00:25,082
I thought violent images
wouldn't be good for my future fetus...

10
00:00:25,191 --> 00:00:29,184
so instead,
I rented this video of a live water birth.

11
00:00:31,898 --> 00:00:35,629
They don't know what it is.
It just showed up on my mom's X-ray.

12
00:00:35,735 --> 00:00:37,498
Look at this crib.

13
00:00:37,604 --> 00:00:39,765
<i>But all and all, it wasn't a problem.</i>

14
00:00:39,873 --> 00:00:42,501
<i>That is, until the night</i>
<i>of Barney's boutonniere.</i>

15
00:00:42,609 --> 00:00:44,702
- Oh, you're wearing a flower.
- Thank you.

16
00:00:44,811 --> 00:00:47,439
- I didn't compliment. Just observed.
- I know, isn't it?

17
00:00:47,547 --> 00:00:50,277
- Why are you wearing that?
- Why does Barney do anything ever?

18
00:00:50,383 --> 00:00:52,180
Exactly! Science!

19
00:00:52,285 --> 00:00:54,253
There is an 83% correlation...

20
00:00:54,354 --> 00:00:57,983
between the times men wear boutonnieres
and the times they get laid.

21
00:00:58,091 --> 00:01:02,528
Think about it...
proms, weddings, grandmas' funerals.

22
00:01:02,629 --> 00:01:04,824
Thanks for the redhead, Nana.

23
00:01:04,931 --> 00:01:08,662
The everyday boutonniere, by Stinson.

24
00:01:08,768 --> 00:01:11,703
And nope. I'm sorry, Barney,
but no girl is going home...

25
00:01:11,805 --> 00:01:13,830
with a guy with a flower on his chest...

26
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:16,408
unless he's a clown
and she's in the trunk of his car.

27
00:01:16,509 --> 00:01:19,444
Along with 50 other clowns.

28
00:01:21,448 --> 00:01:23,643
It's a clown car.

29
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:28,881
Robin, did you know that "boutonniere"
is French for "booty is near"?

30
00:01:28,988 --> 00:01:30,888
- Hmm.
- True story.

31
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:33,356
- <i>Une histoire vraie.</i>
- Hmm.

32
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:37,419
Did you know that " Barney" is French for " sad
little guy who works way too hard to get laid"?

33
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:39,498
Woman, you best check yourself.

34
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:42,466
Yeah, on the bright side,
I guess suits are pretty boring without them.

35
00:01:42,569 --> 00:01:46,505
Madam, that is an insult
that cannot be borne!

36
00:01:46,606 --> 00:01:48,597
I demand satisfaction!

37
00:01:48,708 --> 00:01:50,437
What, are we gonna duel?

38
00:01:50,543 --> 00:01:53,341
No, I'm gonna show everyone
this embarrassing video of you.

39
00:01:53,446 --> 00:01:56,415
It's Robin Sparkles 3, y'all.

40
00:02:11,364 --> 00:02:13,491
<i>Kids, by this point we knew Aunt Robin...</i>

41
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:17,161
<i>had been a teen pop sensation in Canada</i>
<i>known as Robin Sparkles.</i>

42
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:18,965
<i>And we also knew</i>
<i>that her Robin Sparkles character...</i>

43
00:02:19,072 --> 00:02:22,633
<i>came from a Canadian TVshow</i>
<i>which we'd never seen...</i>

44
00:02:22,742 --> 00:02:24,232
<i>until now.</i>

45
00:02:24,344 --> 00:02:26,141
I cannot wait to see what's on this DVD!

46
00:02:26,246 --> 00:02:28,339
- You haven't watched it yet?
- No, of course not.

47
00:02:28,448 --> 00:02:31,042
I wanted my first time to be
with someone I cared about.

48
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:33,483
- <i>That's so sweet.</i>
- I get that a lot. Well, once.

49
00:02:33,586 --> 00:02:36,817
Hey, Robin, do you wanna go get
a Korean massage on Saturday?

50
00:02:36,923 --> 00:02:39,983
I'd love to. I've got this knot in my neck
that's so annoying.

51
00:02:40,093 --> 00:02:41,617
Yeah, I figured I should get one now...

52
00:02:41,728 --> 00:02:44,219
because once I get pregnant,
no more massages.

53
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:47,231
- Just so annoying.
- Okay.

54
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:52,604
<i>Space Teens?</i>

55
00:02:52,705 --> 00:02:54,263
Is this a porno?

56
00:02:54,374 --> 00:02:57,241
No, dude! Dude! It's a kid show.

57
00:02:57,343 --> 00:02:59,004
Oh.

58
00:03:00,079 --> 00:03:01,740
Yeah, yeah!

59
00:03:05,151 --> 00:03:07,551
I don't know.
This does have all the earmarks of porn.

60
00:03:07,654 --> 00:03:09,281
Stripper pole. Bad lighting.

61
00:03:09,389 --> 00:03:11,857
Delusional girl who thinks it's
a stepping stone to mainstream success.

62
00:03:11,958 --> 00:03:14,358
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
It's a big ol' bowl of porn flakes.

63
00:03:21,901 --> 00:03:25,302
Whoa! And who is this exquisite keytarist...

64
00:03:25,405 --> 00:03:27,202
I assume you're about
to make sweet love to?

65
00:03:27,307 --> 00:03:28,934
Oh, that's Jessica Glitter.

66
00:03:29,042 --> 00:03:31,203
She was my B.F.F. on the show
and in real life.

67
00:03:31,311 --> 00:03:33,006
Ah, B.F.F.'s.

68
00:03:33,112 --> 00:03:35,979
Did you guys have sleepovers,
get mad at each other and wrestle...

69
00:03:36,082 --> 00:03:38,209
but then end up kissing
in a tender embrace?

70
00:03:38,318 --> 00:03:39,785
- Here, show us on Lily.
- You know what?

71
00:03:39,886 --> 00:03:41,945
If you're gonna be disgusting,
we're not watching this, okay?

72
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:46,219
Yeah, come on, Barney.
It's just a cute little story about...

73
00:03:46,326 --> 00:03:48,226
What exactly is this about?

74
00:03:48,328 --> 00:03:52,128
Two average Canadian teenagers
who solve crimes in space using math.

75
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:54,632
- That sounds ridiculous.
- So sue me...

76
00:03:54,734 --> 00:03:57,294
like the producers
of <i>Milky Way Mathletes</i> tried to.

77
00:04:06,579 --> 00:04:10,709
Great job using long division
to catch that space burglar, eh?

78
00:04:10,817 --> 00:04:15,777
What can I say? He'll be in galactic jail
for the remainder of his life.

79
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:19,558
<i>Sparkles, Glitter.</i>

80
00:04:19,659 --> 00:04:21,490
<i>We're about to enter an asteroid belt, eh?</i>

81
00:04:21,594 --> 00:04:24,358
Brace for turbulence!

82
00:04:24,464 --> 00:04:26,694
- Ooh.
- Ooh.

83
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:31,101
I have to say, as much as I hate
to agree with Barney...

84
00:04:31,204 --> 00:04:33,934
this does seem to be a veritable pornucopia.

85
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:36,235
Okay, guys, come on! It's a kid show.

86
00:04:36,342 --> 00:04:39,277
Like, uh, <i>Electric Company</i>
or <i>Sesame Street</i> or, um...

87
00:04:39,379 --> 00:04:41,279
- You can't do that on television.
- Exactly.

88
00:04:41,381 --> 00:04:44,782
No. You can't do <i>that</i> on television.

89
00:04:49,222 --> 00:04:51,713
Robin, this show is so dirty...

90
00:04:51,824 --> 00:04:54,452
I don't know whether to hug you
or run a shower for you...

91
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,994
so you can sit there alone,
crying and clenching your knees.

92
00:04:57,096 --> 00:04:59,530
It's just bad camera work, okay?

93
00:04:59,632 --> 00:05:01,793
Wayne, our camera guy...
he wasn't that great.

94
00:05:01,901 --> 00:05:03,835
I don't know.
I think he did a pretty good job...

95
00:05:03,936 --> 00:05:07,303
considering he was probably
only using one hand.

96
00:05:07,407 --> 00:05:09,568
You know what?
I feel bad for you Americans...

97
00:05:09,676 --> 00:05:13,237
that you can look at this wondrous and
educational adventure through space...

98
00:05:13,346 --> 00:05:15,041
and see something obscene.

99
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:19,244
Can you just please try to look at this
with the innocence of a child?

100
00:05:19,352 --> 00:05:22,321
- Innocence of a child. Got it.
- Here we go.

101
00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:26,158
<i>Girls, if you wanna get through</i>
<i>the asteroid belt...</i>

102
00:05:26,259 --> 00:05:28,250
<i>you've got to use multiplication.</i>

103
00:05:28,361 --> 00:05:30,261
<i>To the joystickl</i>

104
00:05:32,598 --> 00:05:34,998
<i>Okay, Space Teens, let's multiply.</i>

105
00:05:35,101 --> 00:05:37,331
- <i>Five times six?</i>
- Ooh, 30.

106
00:05:37,437 --> 00:05:39,405
<i>Yesl Seven times four?</i>

107
00:05:39,505 --> 00:05:41,666
- <i>Twenty-eightl</i>
- <i>Keep going.</i>

108
00:05:41,774 --> 00:05:43,867
- <i>Eight times nine?</i>
- Seventy-two!

109
00:05:43,976 --> 00:05:46,274
<i>Don't stop nowl Almost there.</i>

110
00:05:46,379 --> 00:05:49,507
<i>Twenty-three times three?</i>

111
00:05:49,615 --> 00:05:51,276
- Hey!
- What are you doing?

112
00:05:51,384 --> 00:05:53,352
I'm sorry. We gotta ration this.

113
00:05:53,453 --> 00:05:56,854
It's like we're on a desert island
and this video is a really hot, naked chick...

114
00:05:56,956 --> 00:06:00,585
and she's got, like, seaweed on her
and a seashell bra.

115
00:06:00,693 --> 00:06:02,422
You all feel me.

116
00:06:02,528 --> 00:06:06,259
Hey, if you and Jessica are B.F.F.'s,
how come we've never met her?

117
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:08,357
Okay, well, it was a long time ago, okay?

118
00:06:08,468 --> 00:06:11,699
I get a Christmas card from her every year,
but we're not really friends anymore.

119
00:06:11,804 --> 00:06:13,931
But B.F.F.'s are forever.

120
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:16,907
Oh, come on, Lily. Nobody stays friends
with their high school friends.

121
00:06:17,009 --> 00:06:20,308
- I'm still friends with Punchy.
- Dude, he lives in Cleveland.

122
00:06:20,413 --> 00:06:24,076
You see him once a year, at which point
he punches you really hard in the arm...

123
00:06:24,183 --> 00:06:26,242
and tells everyone
how you dookied your pants.

124
00:06:26,352 --> 00:06:29,549
I know on paper he sounds great,
but you guys aren't really friends.

125
00:06:29,655 --> 00:06:32,954
Look, I may not see him a lot,
but it doesn't matter.

126
00:06:33,059 --> 00:06:35,994
Observe.

127
00:06:36,095 --> 00:06:38,893
Schmosby!

128
00:06:38,998 --> 00:06:40,158
- Punchy!
- Schmosby!

129
00:06:40,266 --> 00:06:41,324
- Punchy!
- Schmosby!

130
00:06:41,434 --> 00:06:42,628
- Punchy!
- Schmosby!

131
00:06:42,735 --> 00:06:44,635
- Punchy!
- Hey, good talkin' to you, Ted.

132
00:06:44,737 --> 00:06:47,228
- Yeah, you too. If you're ever in New York.
- Definitely.

133
00:06:48,875 --> 00:06:51,400
We are just two peas.

134
00:06:51,511 --> 00:06:55,208
I don't get it. How can you and Glitter
just stop being friends?

135
00:06:55,314 --> 00:06:57,805
- Best friends don't do that.
- Well, we did, okay?

136
00:06:57,917 --> 00:07:00,750
And I haven't talked to her
in, like, five years, so just drop it.

137
00:07:00,853 --> 00:07:02,753
I gotta go.

138
00:07:05,024 --> 00:07:07,549
Whoa.

139
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:10,561
What do you think came
between Robin and Jessica?

140
00:07:10,663 --> 00:07:13,188
Much like our friends, the Space Teens...

141
00:07:13,299 --> 00:07:16,996
I think I can solve this crime with math.

142
00:07:19,605 --> 00:07:23,336
Okay. Okay, here is a Christmas card
that Jessica sent Robin.

143
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:26,344
- Lily, how old would you say that kid is?
- Four years, three months.

144
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:28,880
Which means Jessica
got pregnant five years ago...

145
00:07:28,981 --> 00:07:31,176
right around the time
she and Robin stopped being friends.

146
00:07:31,284 --> 00:07:33,445
Of course. Robin hates kids.

147
00:07:33,553 --> 00:07:36,283
The last thing she would wanna do
is hang out with some little brat.

148
00:07:36,389 --> 00:07:39,847
Thus, if I may...

149
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:42,928
When Glitter's womb a fruit did bear...

150
00:07:43,029 --> 00:07:47,022
Robin said,
"To hell with this, I'm outta h-hare."

151
00:07:49,402 --> 00:07:52,337
- Glitter got pregnant, so Robin dumped her.
- Oh!

152
00:07:52,438 --> 00:07:54,963
Wow. That's gotta be it. Right, Lil?

153
00:07:56,342 --> 00:07:59,709
- Lil?
- Robin's gonna dump me.

154
00:07:59,812 --> 00:08:01,780
Oh, sweetheart.

155
00:08:01,881 --> 00:08:04,975
Aha! When a second uterus
plumped becomes...

156
00:08:05,084 --> 00:08:07,450
Dude.

157
00:08:07,553 --> 00:08:09,180
Feel the room.

158
00:08:18,865 --> 00:08:21,060
- No.
- We've been waiting all day.

159
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:22,657
Just watch it without me.

160
00:08:22,768 --> 00:08:25,498
Two dudes on the couch together
watching porn? That's kinda weird.

161
00:08:25,605 --> 00:08:27,368
Okay, it's not porn. It's a kid show.

162
00:08:27,473 --> 00:08:30,340
Two dudes watchin'
a kid show might be worse.

163
00:08:30,443 --> 00:08:33,173
- Okay, fine. I'll watch it with you.
- Yah!

164
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:36,942
But if either of you makes even one peep
about this show being dirty, I'm turning it off.

165
00:08:37,049 --> 00:08:39,017
- I'm serious!
- We...

166
00:08:41,153 --> 00:08:43,553
Hey, Jessica. How's your beaver?

167
00:08:44,724 --> 00:08:47,022
Great. How's your beaver?

168
00:08:47,126 --> 00:08:49,686
Busy as ever.

169
00:08:51,564 --> 00:08:53,498
Our characters had pet beavers.

170
00:08:53,599 --> 00:08:57,035
- Sure.
- The beaver is the official animal of Canada.

171
00:08:57,136 --> 00:08:59,229
It's their national mascot.

172
00:09:00,573 --> 00:09:02,871
It's a noble creature.

173
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:04,567
Okay, girls.

174
00:09:04,677 --> 00:09:08,204
Everyone knows a beaver's
favorite food is wood.

175
00:09:08,314 --> 00:09:12,375
I just hope we brought along enough of it
for a three-day galactic space journey.

176
00:09:12,485 --> 00:09:14,350
So let's do the math.

177
00:09:14,453 --> 00:09:18,913
If Robin's beaver devours six inches
of wood every half hour...

178
00:09:19,025 --> 00:09:22,893
<i>and Jessica's beaver devours</i>
<i>eight inches of wood every 45 minutes...</i>

179
00:09:22,995 --> 00:09:27,955
how much wood will I need to keep both of
these beavers well fed all weekend long?

180
00:09:29,869 --> 00:09:31,564
<i>While you figure it out at home...</i>

181
00:09:31,671 --> 00:09:34,697
how about we sing you a song
about our beavers?

182
00:09:34,807 --> 00:09:37,332
Hey...

183
00:09:37,443 --> 00:09:40,708
- Hey!
- You do not get to hear the beaver song!

184
00:09:40,813 --> 00:09:44,442
It is a sweet song about friendship,
and you guys are being disgusting!

185
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:47,451
- And beavers are adorable!
- No arguments here.

186
00:09:52,191 --> 00:09:55,251
'Sup, Schmosby! What's the man doin'?

187
00:09:55,361 --> 00:09:56,953
Punchy, what are ya doin' here?

188
00:09:57,063 --> 00:10:00,396
Well, yesterday you said
if I was ever in New York.

189
00:10:00,499 --> 00:10:02,763
- 'Sup, turds?
- Ew.

190
00:10:02,868 --> 00:10:05,098
Okay. Um, uh, where you stayin'?

191
00:10:05,204 --> 00:10:08,173
In your mom's pants. Trick! She's old.

192
00:10:08,274 --> 00:10:10,799
Hey, don't worry about me.
I'm cool on the couch.

193
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:14,038
- He's staying here? You're staying here?
- I know. It's so good, right?

194
00:10:14,146 --> 00:10:16,512
Feels like you're dreaming?
But check your totem, brah.

195
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:19,710
Punchy's here in the flesh. So why don't
we get one of these, Ted? Yeah.

196
00:10:19,819 --> 00:10:21,480
Remember these? High school.

197
00:10:21,587 --> 00:10:23,953
Junior high.
Elementary school. Remember those?

198
00:10:24,056 --> 00:10:26,650
- Look, Punchy's here.
- Yeah.

199
00:10:26,759 --> 00:10:30,126
Hey, Schmosby, remember when you dookied
in your pants down by the lake?

200
00:10:30,229 --> 00:10:31,992
Unbelievable!

201
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:36,898
Hey, Schmosby,
remember when you dookied on the couch...

202
00:10:37,003 --> 00:10:39,198
in the form of your idiot
high school friend?

203
00:10:40,873 --> 00:10:43,398
Unbelievable!

204
00:10:43,509 --> 00:10:45,534
Come on. I worry about the guy.

205
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:48,637
He's had the same dead-end job
at a car rental place for 15 years.

206
00:10:48,748 --> 00:10:51,376
- Don't care.
- He's been stuck in Cleveland his whole life.

207
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:54,282
- Get a hotel.
- Robin.

208
00:10:54,387 --> 00:10:57,356
- LeBron.
- Okay. One night.

209
00:10:58,190 --> 00:11:00,124
Gotta go.

210
00:11:00,226 --> 00:11:02,319
Hey. Where are you goin'?
We just got here.

211
00:11:02,428 --> 00:11:04,555
- Oh, uh, Korean massage.
- By yourself?

212
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:08,361
Well, I figured you'd be busy reading <i>What</i>
<i>to Expect When You're Expecting to Expect.</i>

213
00:11:10,703 --> 00:11:14,662
Guys, did you see that?
She's going to a Korean massage without me.

214
00:11:14,774 --> 00:11:16,605
That's our thing.

215
00:11:16,709 --> 00:11:20,167
I'm telling you, she's gonna dump me
just like she dumped Glitter.

216
00:11:20,279 --> 00:11:22,577
Lily, come on.
We don't even know that's what happened.

217
00:11:22,682 --> 00:11:26,140
Um, hello. Somebody already solved
that crime using math, remember?

218
00:11:26,252 --> 00:11:30,552
Look, Lily, Robin is clearly getting tired
of you constantly talking about babies.

219
00:11:30,656 --> 00:11:32,180
I don't...

220
00:11:32,291 --> 00:11:35,021
- Lily, how old am I?
- 384 months.

221
00:11:35,127 --> 00:11:36,424
Busted!

222
00:11:37,863 --> 00:11:40,661
Okay. So, before you
Lily all over the place...

223
00:11:40,766 --> 00:11:44,361
maybe you should try hanging out with Robin
and not talking about babies.

224
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:46,062
<i>So, Lily did just that.</i>

225
00:11:46,172 --> 00:11:48,538
- <i>She tried not to talk about babies.</i>
- Hey!

226
00:11:48,641 --> 00:11:52,202
- Lily, what brings you to the crib?
- The crib.

227
00:11:52,311 --> 00:11:55,280
- What's the matter? You look rattled.
- Rattled?

228
00:11:55,381 --> 00:11:58,077
- I wanna talk about babies.
- What?

229
00:11:58,184 --> 00:12:00,584
Look, I know you don't care about this stuff...

230
00:12:00,686 --> 00:12:02,415
but I'm about to become a mother.

231
00:12:02,521 --> 00:12:05,046
And as a future mother,
I'm gonna need the support...

232
00:12:05,157 --> 00:12:07,785
Oh, my God! You're not even pregnant yet!

233
00:12:07,893 --> 00:12:09,383
What's that supposed to mean?

234
00:12:09,495 --> 00:12:12,157
It means that a fertilized egg
has not yet attached itself...

235
00:12:12,264 --> 00:12:13,959
to the lining of your uterine wall.

236
00:12:14,066 --> 00:12:16,227
You see? I read your Facebook updates.

237
00:12:16,335 --> 00:12:19,668
It's like... It's all you ever talk about,
Lily, and I'm sick of it!

238
00:12:19,772 --> 00:12:21,865
Well, guess what? I've got some good news.

239
00:12:21,974 --> 00:12:23,942
When that baby comes,
you don't have to see it.

240
00:12:24,043 --> 00:12:27,774
In fact, you don't have to see me.
This whole friendship thing... done.

241
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:28,972
- Great.
- Great.

242
00:12:36,555 --> 00:12:39,080
For crying out loud,
you broke up with Robin?

243
00:12:39,191 --> 00:12:43,685
I had to. We were growing apart,
and we're better off without each other.

244
00:12:43,796 --> 00:12:45,923
Okay, Lily, you sound
about as convincing as you did...

245
00:12:46,031 --> 00:12:49,159
the time you <i>accidentally</i> shredded
my Joey Buttafuoco pants.

246
00:12:50,803 --> 00:12:53,135
No!

247
00:12:53,239 --> 00:12:56,265
Get on the phone, call Robin and fix this.

248
00:12:56,375 --> 00:12:59,936
I can't. The damage is done.

249
00:13:00,045 --> 00:13:02,775
- Can you just hold me?
- You know what? No.

250
00:13:02,882 --> 00:13:05,976
I don't agree with what you did,
and so I refuse to comfort you...

251
00:13:06,085 --> 00:13:08,849
despite how adorable you are when you cry.

252
00:13:08,954 --> 00:13:10,649
Okay.

253
00:13:10,756 --> 00:13:14,283
Okay, maybe just one cuddle,
but then that's it.

254
00:13:15,761 --> 00:13:17,786
Time Square's da bomb!

255
00:13:17,897 --> 00:13:20,422
I got so many great pictures
of all the billboards.

256
00:13:20,533 --> 00:13:22,694
Yeah, you know, there's more
to New York than Times Square.

257
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:25,498
There's the Village,
Lower East Side, Central Park.

258
00:13:25,604 --> 00:13:28,630
They got better billboards
than the ones in Times Square?

259
00:13:28,741 --> 00:13:31,403
- No.
- Times Square's da bomb!

260
00:13:31,510 --> 00:13:33,375
Here, you know what? Hold this, okay?

261
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:36,039
I'm gonna go pee in the jar
I got goin' in the alley.

262
00:13:37,917 --> 00:13:42,411
Seriously, dude, he has got to go.

263
00:13:42,521 --> 00:13:44,421
You need to be, like...

264
00:13:44,523 --> 00:13:46,491
"You are the weakest link. Good-bye."

265
00:13:47,593 --> 00:13:49,993
Punchy, the tribe has spoken.

266
00:13:50,095 --> 00:13:52,188
Please pack up your knives and go.

267
00:13:52,298 --> 00:13:54,698
Your work of art didn't work for us.

268
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,427
Your time's up.

269
00:13:56,535 --> 00:13:58,469
I have to ask you to leave the mansion.

270
00:13:58,571 --> 00:14:00,539
You must leave the ch?teau.

271
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:02,231
Your tour ends here.

272
00:14:02,341 --> 00:14:04,935
- You've been chopped.
- Okay. Yeah, I know.

273
00:14:05,044 --> 00:14:06,602
You've been evicted
from the Big Brother house.

274
00:14:06,712 --> 00:14:10,443
Your dessert just didn't measure up.
Sashay away.

275
00:14:10,549 --> 00:14:13,040
Give me a jacket and leave Hell's Kitchen!

276
00:14:13,152 --> 00:14:14,949
I'm sorry. You did not get a rose.

277
00:14:15,054 --> 00:14:17,022
You have been eliminated from the race.

278
00:14:17,122 --> 00:14:20,319
You are no longer in the running
to be America's Next Top Model.

279
00:14:20,426 --> 00:14:22,053
You're fired. Auf Wiedersehen.

280
00:14:22,161 --> 00:14:25,528
Ted, come look at this.

281
00:14:25,631 --> 00:14:28,293
I found a little wounded bird in the alley.

282
00:14:30,436 --> 00:14:32,768
That's your scrotum.

283
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:36,808
You know it is, Ted. You know it is.
Come on, Ted. You always fall for that!

284
00:14:38,344 --> 00:14:40,812
Yeah, he's gotta go.

285
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:47,853
What are we doing
in Madison Square Garden?

286
00:14:47,953 --> 00:14:51,753
You refused to talk to Robin,
so I thought that you might like to talk to...

287
00:14:51,857 --> 00:14:53,620
the organist for the New York Rangers.

288
00:14:56,695 --> 00:14:58,322
Jessica Glitter?

289
00:15:13,879 --> 00:15:15,938
How did you find Glitter?

290
00:15:16,048 --> 00:15:18,141
Simple, really.
I used my powers of deduction.

291
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:21,913
You see, I knew that Glitter used to be
a keytarist, which is basically a piano...

292
00:15:22,021 --> 00:15:26,253
so I just made a list of all the keyboard-based
occupations, and then I cross matched...

293
00:15:26,358 --> 00:15:29,657
His friend Barney looked me up,
hoping to buy my Space Teens costume.

294
00:15:29,762 --> 00:15:33,095
And, Glitter, be cool.

295
00:15:33,198 --> 00:15:35,462
So, is this the one
who's best friends with Robin now?

296
00:15:35,567 --> 00:15:40,368
No, more like ex-best friends.
Just like you.

297
00:15:40,472 --> 00:15:42,599
Sorry to hear that.

298
00:15:42,708 --> 00:15:44,335
I miss Robin.

299
00:15:46,078 --> 00:15:48,774
Yeah, well, Marshall and I
are about to get pregnant...

300
00:15:48,881 --> 00:15:53,375
and I know she stopped being friends with you
when you had a baby, so...

301
00:15:53,485 --> 00:15:55,612
Oh, Robin didn't stop being friends with me.

302
00:15:55,721 --> 00:15:58,849
- I stopped being friends with her.
- What? Why?

303
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:00,892
Because I had a baby.

304
00:16:00,993 --> 00:16:04,053
Honey, when you have a baby,
all that best friend stuff...

305
00:16:04,163 --> 00:16:06,825
hockey, bow hunting for caribou, math...

306
00:16:06,932 --> 00:16:08,832
that all goes out the window.

307
00:16:08,934 --> 00:16:11,835
I mean, I tried to stay friends with her,
but it just didn't happen.

308
00:16:11,937 --> 00:16:13,837
She took it pretty hard.

309
00:16:13,939 --> 00:16:15,998
I even thought
she might try to kill herself.

310
00:16:18,577 --> 00:16:20,408
Charge!

311
00:16:20,512 --> 00:16:23,538
Wow, you dumped her
just because you had a baby?

312
00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:28,052
- That's cold.
- Didn't you do the same thing, minus the baby?

313
00:16:28,153 --> 00:16:30,678
Oh, God. I gotta go.

314
00:16:30,789 --> 00:16:32,654
I gotta go apologize to Robin.

315
00:16:32,758 --> 00:16:36,353
l-I need to tell her I love her
and that she'll always be a priority.

316
00:16:36,462 --> 00:16:39,090
Be careful, Lily.
I made those promises too.

317
00:16:39,198 --> 00:16:42,895
And now I haven't even talked to her
in five years.

318
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:48,099
Sure, I thought about picking up the phone
and calling her a hundred times...

319
00:16:48,207 --> 00:16:50,505
but I just never have the courage to act...

320
00:16:53,278 --> 00:16:55,109
Hey!

321
00:16:56,448 --> 00:16:58,473
Go ahead.

322
00:17:05,257 --> 00:17:07,623
Hey, do you guys get
<i>Big Chuck and Lil'John</i> out here?

323
00:17:07,726 --> 00:17:10,524
- Punchy, it's time to go back.
- Back to Times Square?

324
00:17:10,629 --> 00:17:13,462
Uh, no. Back... Back to Cleveland.

325
00:17:13,565 --> 00:17:15,760
I don't know if I can do that, bro.

326
00:17:15,868 --> 00:17:18,894
I mean, yeah, I been jonesin'
for a piece of Cleveland-style pizza...

327
00:17:19,004 --> 00:17:21,234
but I feel bad about leaving you out here.

328
00:17:21,340 --> 00:17:24,969
- I worry about you, Ted.
- You worry about me?

329
00:17:25,077 --> 00:17:27,705
Yeah. The other day when you called...

330
00:17:27,813 --> 00:17:29,212
- Schmosby!
- Punchy!

331
00:17:29,314 --> 00:17:31,441
- Good talkin' to you.
- You too. If you're ever in New York.

332
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:33,415
Definitely.

333
00:17:36,522 --> 00:17:39,218
- Sweetie, who was that?
- It's my friend Ted.

334
00:17:39,324 --> 00:17:42,816
- He sounded kind of depressed.
- Is this the Ted who got left at the altar?

335
00:17:42,928 --> 00:17:46,591
Yeah. He's not doin' so good.

336
00:17:46,698 --> 00:17:50,998
Poor guy lives in a tiny apartment
in New York nowhere near Times Square.

337
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:53,571
He's got no family around.
He's still single.

338
00:17:53,672 --> 00:17:56,470
Doesn't have a backyard.
It's just a bummer.

339
00:17:56,575 --> 00:17:59,203
Maybe you should go visit him,
cheer him up a little.

340
00:17:59,311 --> 00:18:02,439
You know, buy him some shots,
do the whole wounded bird trick.

341
00:18:02,548 --> 00:18:05,574
- You think that will work?
- Worked on me.

342
00:18:08,353 --> 00:18:11,686
Wow. She sounds pretty great, Punchy.

343
00:18:12,758 --> 00:18:14,589
She's my angel.

344
00:18:14,693 --> 00:18:17,287
In fact, uh, we're getting married.

345
00:18:18,163 --> 00:18:20,393
Wow! Wow! That's...

346
00:18:20,499 --> 00:18:22,160
I'm... I'm really happy for you.

347
00:18:22,267 --> 00:18:23,996
Thanks, Ted. Thanks.

348
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:26,833
Actually, that's the other reason
why I came out here.

349
00:18:26,939 --> 00:18:29,999
I wanted to see if you'd be my best man.

350
00:18:32,044 --> 00:18:33,705
- Of course I will.
- Yo!

351
00:18:33,812 --> 00:18:35,939
That's great. Oh, no, you're...

352
00:18:36,048 --> 00:18:39,415
- Cop out! Sucker! Oh, that's it! I'm not...
- Yeah.

353
00:18:39,651 --> 00:18:43,018
<i>That night, Lily went to</i>
<i>the one place she knew she could find Robin...</i>

354
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:45,716
<i>New York's premiere Canadian bar,</i>
<i>the Hoser Hut.</i>

355
00:18:45,824 --> 00:18:49,453
Oh, there you are.
Robin, I owe you a huge apology.

356
00:18:49,561 --> 00:18:51,358
No, no. Me first.

357
00:18:51,463 --> 00:18:53,624
I've been pulling away from you,
and I'm sorry.

358
00:18:53,732 --> 00:18:56,462
It's just, the last time
my best friend had a baby...

359
00:18:56,568 --> 00:18:58,433
I know. I know all about it.

360
00:18:58,537 --> 00:19:01,734
It's not gonna happen with you and me.

361
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:05,037
And I'm sorry I've been going crazy
with this baby stuff.

362
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:07,169
It's... I know you hate babies.

363
00:19:07,279 --> 00:19:10,578
Whoa. Look, I hate most babies.

364
00:19:10,682 --> 00:19:14,140
But your baby...
I'm gonna love that kid so much.

365
00:19:14,253 --> 00:19:16,653
- I'm gonna pick it up and everything.
- Oh!

366
00:19:18,023 --> 00:19:21,982
- Ohh. I'm so happy you guys made up.
- Me too.

367
00:19:22,094 --> 00:19:25,154
Where do I know this song from?

368
00:19:25,264 --> 00:19:28,324
Oh, my God. It's the beaver song.
Okay, which one of you put this on?

369
00:19:29,434 --> 00:19:31,231
# Hey, beaver, come on #

370
00:19:32,504 --> 00:19:36,065
# When you feel alone #

371
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:39,872
# Just pick up that phone #

372
00:19:39,978 --> 00:19:44,039
# And I'll be there to share my #

373
00:19:44,149 --> 00:19:47,516
# Ice-cream cone #

374
00:19:47,619 --> 00:19:51,180
# We'll lick it side by side #

375
00:19:51,290 --> 00:19:55,090
- Wow, this is so dirty.
- Come on, Barney.
It's a sweet song about friendship.

376
00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:56,752
Yeah. Dude, come on.

377
00:19:56,862 --> 00:19:59,592
# Before the day is done #

378
00:20:01,366 --> 00:20:04,767
# Two beavers are better than one #

379
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:08,897
# Da-da, da-da-da-da, da-da-da #

380
00:20:09,007 --> 00:20:12,135
# Two beavers are better than one #

381
00:20:12,244 --> 00:20:13,939
# They're twice the fun #

382
00:20:14,046 --> 00:20:16,810
- # Ask anyone #
- Whoo-hoo!

383
00:20:16,915 --> 00:20:20,248
# A second beaver can be #

384
00:20:20,352 --> 00:20:22,786
# Second to none #

00:20:22,888 --> 00:20:25,982
# Two beavers are better than one #

386
00:20:26,091 --> 00:20:27,115
Whoo!

387
00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:29,217
# Da-da, da-da-da #

388
00:20:29,328 --> 00:20:32,229
# You're my favorite beaver #

389
00:20:34,433 --> 00:20:38,028
# Two beavers are better than one #
