00:00:01,267 --> 00:00:04,115
<i>Kids, after Uncle Marshall lost his father,</i>

2
00:00:04,150 --> 00:00:06,203
<i>he decided to stay home a while
to take care of his mother.</i>

3
00:00:06,204 --> 00:00:07,471
But the longer he stayed there,

4
00:00:07,472 --> 00:00:10,207
<i>the more it was like he had
never left Minnesota.</i>

5
00:00:10,208 --> 00:00:12,409
Eriksen residence, Marshall speaking.

6
00:00:12,410 --> 00:00:13,977
Oh, that is too cute.

7
00:00:13,978 --> 00:00:14,978
Say it again.

8
00:00:14,979 --> 00:00:15,979
No.

9
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:17,281
It's called manners, jerk.

10
00:00:17,282 --> 00:00:19,083
Now, what's-what's going on in New York?

11
00:00:19,084 --> 00:00:20,217
Give me something.

12
00:00:20,218 --> 00:00:22,653
There is one thing that's been going on.

13
00:00:22,654 --> 00:00:28,726
Uh, it's about Ted... and Zoey.

14
00:00:28,727 --> 00:00:30,527
<i>to save an old building from being torn down</i>

15
00:00:30,528 --> 00:00:33,497
<i>and replaced by a new building that
I'd been hired to design.</i>

16
00:00:33,498 --> 00:00:34,631
And yet somehow, despite this,

17
00:00:34,632 --> 00:00:36,834
<i>we had all managed to become friends.</i>

18
00:00:36,835 --> 00:00:37,868
<i>Which brings us to the night</i>

19
00:00:37,869 --> 00:00:40,237
<i>Aunt Robin decided to cook dinner.</i>

20
00:00:45,226 --> 00:00:47,678
I thought the oven was Celsius.

21
00:00:47,679 --> 00:00:48,912
It's okay.

22
00:00:48,913 --> 00:00:50,481
We got hot dogs.

23
00:00:50,482 --> 00:00:53,684
Yeah, and it's not like you
can screw up a hot dog.

24
00:00:54,702 --> 00:00:56,720
Oh, God.

25
00:00:56,721 --> 00:00:58,155
This is so good.

26
00:00:58,156 --> 00:01:01,091
I'm gonna finish it in the bathroom.

27
00:01:03,194 --> 00:01:05,462
Could someone pass the ketchup?

28
00:01:05,463 --> 00:01:07,164
I hope I can pass this hot dog.

29
00:01:07,966 --> 00:01:09,566
Oh.

30
00:01:09,567 --> 00:01:11,135
Oops. Well, looks like someone's

31
00:01:11,136 --> 00:01:13,504
going out in the cold to get more ketchup.

32
00:01:13,505 --> 00:01:16,039
Oh, come on, man, I brought the wine.

33
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:16,907
Which is all gone.

34
00:01:16,908 --> 00:01:18,776
Oops.

35
00:01:19,877 --> 00:01:21,061
All right, I tell you what--

36
00:01:21,062 --> 00:01:23,013
you get this one bottle,
I'll get the next three.

37
00:01:23,014 --> 00:01:24,348
Hmm, tell you what-- no dice.

38
00:01:24,349 --> 00:01:25,582
I'll get the next hundred.

39
00:01:25,583 --> 00:01:26,717
You're not getting out of this.

40
00:01:26,718 --> 00:01:28,285
You want to go on a date with my hot cousin?

41
00:01:28,286 --> 00:01:29,719
I'll get the ketchup.

44
00:01:43,968 --> 00:01:45,636
Robin, I just want you to know,

45
00:01:45,637 --> 00:01:48,138
it's either this story you're
telling me or another game

46
00:01:48,139 --> 00:01:51,308
of Clue against myself, so make it good.

47
00:01:51,309 --> 00:01:52,309
Oh, it's good.

48
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:53,544
You see, after that night,

49
00:01:53,545 --> 00:01:55,979
none of us heard from Zoey for a while.

50
00:01:55,980 --> 00:01:58,515
<i>Finally, Ted called her up. Hello.</i>

51
00:01:58,516 --> 00:02:00,350
So are we ever gonna see you again?

52
00:02:00,351 --> 00:02:01,452
Because, if I recall correctly,

53
00:02:01,453 --> 00:02:03,754
you owe me a date with your hot cousin.

54
00:02:03,755 --> 00:02:05,556
You still want to do that?

55
00:02:05,557 --> 00:02:07,357
Yes. And we miss you.

56
00:02:07,358 --> 00:02:09,993
But the cousin thing mostly.
Let's get that going.

57
00:02:09,994 --> 00:02:11,445
Don't worry, Ted, she's cute.

58
00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:14,832
"Cute" means "fat""

59
00:02:14,833 --> 00:02:16,433
She's not fat.

60
00:02:16,434 --> 00:02:19,937
"Not fat" means "ugly""

61
00:02:19,938 --> 00:02:21,472
Oh, here she is.

62
00:02:22,774 --> 00:02:24,842
I take back everything I said.

63
00:02:24,843 --> 00:02:27,377
That girl is extremely attractive.

64
00:02:27,378 --> 00:02:28,829
Hey, Zoey. Hey.

65
00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:31,682
Ted, this is my cousin...

66
00:02:31,683 --> 00:02:33,016
<i> Kids, to be honest,</i>

67
00:02:33,017 --> 00:02:34,551
<i>I don't quite remember this girl's name.</i>

68
00:02:34,552 --> 00:02:35,819
<i>None of us do,</i>

69
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:37,888
<i>because as this story has
been told and retold,</i>

70
00:02:37,889 --> 00:02:39,857
<i>we've always just referred to her as...</i>

71
00:02:39,858 --> 00:02:41,625
Honey.

72
00:02:41,626 --> 00:02:43,026
Hi, Honey, I'm Ted.

73
00:02:43,027 --> 00:02:44,528
<i>And here's why.</i>

74
00:02:44,529 --> 00:02:47,431
She is a lovely person--

75
00:02:47,432 --> 00:02:51,568
warm, intelligent, just kind of gullible.

76
00:02:51,569 --> 00:02:52,636
It's like, every word

77
00:02:52,637 --> 00:02:54,805
out of her mouth makes you want to be like,

78
00:02:54,806 --> 00:02:57,007
"Oh, honey."

79
00:02:57,008 --> 00:02:58,375
Interesting.

80
00:02:58,376 --> 00:02:59,693
Show your work.

81
00:02:59,694 --> 00:03:02,079
My apartment building is so safe.

82
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:05,849
My landlord-- he even installed
a security camera in my shower.

83
00:03:05,850 --> 00:03:07,551
Oh, honey.

84
00:03:07,552 --> 00:03:09,686
Maybe I should feel weird
about giving a stranger

85
00:03:09,687 --> 00:03:11,922
my Social Security number,

86
00:03:11,923 --> 00:03:15,225
but the guy's a Nigerian prince.

87
00:03:15,226 --> 00:03:17,361
Oh, honey.

88
00:03:17,362 --> 00:03:20,230
I just had a great TV audition.

89
00:03:20,231 --> 00:03:23,066
Behind the KFC where the
executive producer works

90
00:03:23,067 --> 00:03:24,968
on the weekends.

91
00:03:24,969 --> 00:03:26,737
Oh, honey.

92
00:03:26,738 --> 00:03:31,141
<i>Long story short, I'm going to be on Lost.</i>

93
00:03:31,142 --> 00:03:33,343
Oh, honey.

94
00:03:33,344 --> 00:03:34,361
I know.

95
00:03:34,362 --> 00:03:36,246
You just want to wrap her up in a blanket

96
00:03:36,247 --> 00:03:37,481
and give her a cup of tea.

97
00:03:37,482 --> 00:03:38,682
She's, like, this

98
00:03:38,683 --> 00:03:39,983
little lost lamb

99
00:03:39,984 --> 00:03:42,586
who needs to be protected from the wolves.

100
00:03:42,587 --> 00:03:44,054
Speaking of whom...

101
00:03:44,055 --> 00:03:46,790
Yeah, I always get those e-
mails from Michelle Obama

102
00:03:46,791 --> 00:03:49,876
and sometimes Obama himself.

103
00:03:49,877 --> 00:03:52,996
Oh, honey.

104
00:03:52,997 --> 00:03:54,464
<i> So the night went on,</i>

105
00:03:54,465 --> 00:03:56,533
<i>and eventually everyone went home,</i>

106
00:03:56,534 --> 00:03:58,902
<i>except for Ted and Honey.</i>

107
00:03:58,903 --> 00:04:01,138
Wow, an architect.

108
00:04:01,139 --> 00:04:02,439
How fascinating.

109
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:04,874
Why do they call 'em coasters?

110
00:04:04,875 --> 00:04:06,209
<i>And Barney.</i>

111
00:04:06,210 --> 00:04:10,097
Okay, time to go home.

112
00:04:10,615 --> 00:04:12,549
Ted, a word.

113
00:04:15,553 --> 00:04:17,387
God, I hate these situations.

114
00:04:17,388 --> 00:04:19,239
What are we gonna do about this?

115
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:20,724
What are you talking about?

116
00:04:20,725 --> 00:04:22,926
Come on, Ted, it's obvious.

117
00:04:22,927 --> 00:04:24,528
Honey's vibing on me.

118
00:04:24,529 --> 00:04:25,596
What?

119
00:04:25,597 --> 00:04:27,564
It's called body language.

120
00:04:28,533 --> 00:04:30,167
Remember when she was touching your arm

121
00:04:30,168 --> 00:04:31,768
and leaning in real close? Mm-hmm.

122
00:04:31,769 --> 00:04:35,973
Well, while that was happening,
the straw in her drink

123
00:04:35,974 --> 00:04:39,075
was pointed right at me.

124
00:04:39,944 --> 00:04:42,012
I mean...

125
00:04:42,013 --> 00:04:43,981
that's as clear as a signal gets,

126
00:04:43,982 --> 00:04:45,132
so...

127
00:04:46,985 --> 00:04:48,752
I'm so sorry, man.

128
00:04:48,753 --> 00:04:51,788
You're right.

129
00:04:52,490 --> 00:04:53,924
She's all yours, buddy.

130
00:04:53,925 --> 00:04:55,759
I'd say hump her brains out,

131
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:57,694
but someone obviously already has.

132
00:04:57,695 --> 00:05:00,263
<i> Good for you.</i>

133
00:05:00,264 --> 00:05:01,932
Ted Mosby does not take advantage

134
00:05:01,933 --> 00:05:03,300
of poor, helpless honeys.

135
00:05:03,301 --> 00:05:05,102
Yeah, actually, there's another reason

136
00:05:05,103 --> 00:05:06,937
that I didn't go home with her.

137
00:05:06,938 --> 00:05:07,904
Hmm?

138
00:05:07,905 --> 00:05:08,672
He's gay!

139
00:05:08,673 --> 00:05:10,741
Mom, hang up!

140
00:05:10,742 --> 00:05:12,609
I'm sorry.

141
00:05:13,645 --> 00:05:15,078
Go on.

142
00:05:15,079 --> 00:05:16,346
Yeah, actually, there's another reason

143
00:05:16,347 --> 00:05:18,048
that I didn't go home with her.

144
00:05:18,049 --> 00:05:19,216
Hmm?

145
00:05:19,217 --> 00:05:22,252
I'm in love with Zoey.

146
00:05:22,253 --> 00:05:24,221
Oh, my God.

147
00:05:24,222 --> 00:05:25,756
Oh, my God!

148
00:05:25,757 --> 00:05:26,623
Mom!

149
00:05:26,624 --> 00:05:28,809
Sorry.

150
00:05:33,483 --> 00:05:35,150
Ted's in love with Zoey?

151
00:05:35,151 --> 00:05:37,052
But, but she's married.

152
00:05:37,053 --> 00:05:39,087
That boy needs an intervention.

153
00:05:39,088 --> 00:05:40,722
Funny you should say that.

154
00:05:40,723 --> 00:05:42,357
Does anyone know why we're here?

155
00:05:42,358 --> 00:05:43,992
Yeah, who called this intervention?

156
00:05:43,993 --> 00:05:45,694
I did. It's for me.

157
00:05:45,695 --> 00:05:47,579
This is about the coffee breath.

158
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:50,248
Finally. Hmm, no, it's the shoulder hair.

159
00:05:50,249 --> 00:05:51,700
Guys, just let

160
00:05:51,701 --> 00:05:53,502
the man explain how it's all

161
00:05:53,503 --> 00:05:55,470
about his wearing a lady's watch.

162
00:05:55,471 --> 00:05:58,073
It's because I'm in love with Zoey,

163
00:05:58,074 --> 00:05:58,974
and she's married,

164
00:05:58,975 --> 00:06:00,959
so it needs to stop.

165
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:03,612
And... intervene.

166
00:06:03,613 --> 00:06:05,947
Are you sure it's love?

167
00:06:05,948 --> 00:06:08,350
Remember the ketchup bottle?

168
00:06:08,351 --> 00:06:10,152
<i>She wasn't the one who dropped it.</i>

169
00:06:10,153 --> 00:06:13,989
<i>When she reached for it,
our fingers touched, and...</i>

170
00:06:15,525 --> 00:06:19,227
I knew, right in that moment,
this isn't friendship.

171
00:06:19,228 --> 00:06:21,430
This is love.

172
00:06:22,432 --> 00:06:23,298
Wuss.

173
00:06:23,299 --> 00:06:24,282
Marcus!

174
00:06:24,283 --> 00:06:26,568
This is a private conversation!

175
00:06:27,236 --> 00:06:30,005
So what'd the wuss do next?

176
00:06:30,006 --> 00:06:32,407
This is love.

177
00:06:33,276 --> 00:06:36,144
And this was my grandmother's watch.

178
00:06:36,145 --> 00:06:40,281
Anyway, now I have only one
course of action in front of me:

179
00:06:40,282 --> 00:06:42,150
I have to end my friendship with Zoey.

180
00:06:42,151 --> 00:06:43,635
Isn't that a little harsh?

181
00:06:43,636 --> 00:06:44,486
Harsh?

182
00:06:44,487 --> 00:06:45,520
Robin, a single guy

183
00:06:45,521 --> 00:06:47,456
and a married woman cannot be friends

184
00:06:47,457 --> 00:06:49,424
if one's in love with the other.

185
00:06:49,425 --> 00:06:51,460
Yeah, but Zoey is friends with us now, too.

186
00:06:51,461 --> 00:06:53,678
It's not like Ted can just ghost out on her.

187
00:06:53,679 --> 00:06:55,063
She'll always be around.

188
00:06:55,064 --> 00:06:56,698
Then what am I supposed to do?

189
00:06:56,699 --> 00:06:57,799
Okay, just shut it down.

190
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:59,317
Okay, just ignore your feelings.

191
00:06:59,318 --> 00:07:01,169
If-If she asks you for ketchup,

192
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:03,271
tell her to get it her own damn self.

193
00:07:03,272 --> 00:07:05,040
Look, I like Zoey. Without her,

194
00:07:05,041 --> 00:07:08,310
my dinner party wouldn't
have been such a success.

195
00:07:08,311 --> 00:07:09,845
So those feelings of yours--

196
00:07:09,846 --> 00:07:10,879
shut 'em down.

197
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:13,749
Fine.

198
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:15,117
I'll shut 'em down.

199
00:07:15,118 --> 00:07:19,321
And seriously, mouthwash after coffee.

200
00:07:20,456 --> 00:07:23,859
Oh, um, that's my other line.

201
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:25,093
It's not a number I recognize.

202
00:07:25,094 --> 00:07:26,294
So don't answer it.

203
00:07:27,797 --> 00:07:29,131
Yeah.

204
00:07:29,132 --> 00:07:30,632
Oh, my God,

205
00:07:30,633 --> 00:07:32,534
you are so Minnesota.

206
00:07:32,535 --> 00:07:34,136
You can't not answer the phone

207
00:07:34,137 --> 00:07:35,203
because it would be rude.

208
00:07:35,204 --> 00:07:36,304
Well, it would be.

209
00:07:36,305 --> 00:07:38,874
Good-bye.

210
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:40,909
Eriksen residence, Marshall speaking.

211
00:07:40,910 --> 00:07:41,710
Hey, Marshall.

212
00:07:41,711 --> 00:07:42,677
Barney.

213
00:07:42,678 --> 00:07:43,979
W- What number is this?

214
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:45,480
I'm up on burners, playa.

215
00:07:45,481 --> 00:07:47,349
Too many crazies had my old number,

216
00:07:47,350 --> 00:07:50,152
so now I'm all about disposable cell phones.

217
00:07:50,153 --> 00:07:52,187
I'll use one for a while, have my fun,

218
00:07:52,188 --> 00:07:54,089
then dump it and get a new one.

219
00:07:54,090 --> 00:07:55,991
And then I'll do the same with my phone.

220
00:07:55,992 --> 00:08:00,328
Hey, uh, so Robin told me about
this whole Ted and Zoey thing.

221
00:08:00,329 --> 00:08:02,297
Dude, she doesn't know how to tell a story.

222
00:08:02,298 --> 00:08:04,216
<i>I'll tell you that story.</i>

223
00:08:04,217 --> 00:08:05,867
Hey, Zoey.

224
00:08:05,868 --> 00:08:06,835
Hey.

225
00:08:06,836 --> 00:08:09,087
Ted, this is my cousin...

226
00:08:09,088 --> 00:08:11,039
Honey.

227
00:08:13,776 --> 00:08:15,510
<i> Uh...</i>

228
00:08:15,511 --> 00:08:16,912
Robin's version was...

229
00:08:16,913 --> 00:08:18,747
That is exactly how it happened.

230
00:08:18,748 --> 00:08:19,881
So Ted did his best

231
00:08:19,882 --> 00:08:21,983
to impress her, but as per yoozh,

232
00:08:21,984 --> 00:08:25,487
<i>he bored the pants very much on her.</i>

233
00:08:25,488 --> 00:08:27,606
Blah, blah, blah, I'm an architect.

234
00:08:27,607 --> 00:08:30,358
Blah, blah, blah, I don't wear suits.

235
00:08:30,359 --> 00:08:31,560
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

236
00:08:31,561 --> 00:08:34,196
Wow, an architect.

237
00:08:34,197 --> 00:08:35,964
How fascinating.

238
00:08:35,965 --> 00:08:37,232
Blah, blah, blah, blah.

239
00:08:37,233 --> 00:08:38,867
Rambling architecture anecdote.

240
00:08:38,868 --> 00:08:40,235
Blah, blah,

241
00:08:40,236 --> 00:08:41,703
something about a bridge.

242
00:08:41,704 --> 00:08:42,637
Blah, blah, blah...

243
00:08:42,638 --> 00:08:44,706
Straw.

244
00:08:46,509 --> 00:08:49,211
Coaster.

245
00:08:50,079 --> 00:08:53,081
Okay, time to go home.

246
00:08:55,134 --> 00:08:57,719
Anyway, I get Honey back to her place.

247
00:08:58,654 --> 00:09:00,088
Who's your daddy?

248
00:09:00,089 --> 00:09:02,324
Okay, can we skip this part, please?

249
00:09:02,325 --> 00:09:05,727
Sure, I'll just summarize it.

250
00:09:18,274 --> 00:09:19,274
Okay, that's been

251
00:09:19,275 --> 00:09:20,408
going on a while.

252
00:09:20,409 --> 00:09:22,777
Only way I know how.

253
00:09:22,778 --> 00:09:25,780
Any-who, next day, I'm going into work.

254
00:09:25,781 --> 00:09:27,615
<i>I run into Zoey. Hey, Zoey.</i>

255
00:09:27,616 --> 00:09:30,752
That cousin of yours-- Honey-- yowsa!

256
00:09:30,753 --> 00:09:32,754
I must say, your family
tree has got a couple

257
00:09:32,755 --> 00:09:34,923
of pretty big coconuts.

258
00:09:34,924 --> 00:09:36,091
Thanks.

259
00:09:36,092 --> 00:09:38,176
Yeah, we had a great time last night.

260
00:09:38,177 --> 00:09:40,929
And then just hand stuff
in the morning, so...

261
00:09:40,930 --> 00:09:42,697
Wait, she didn't go home with Ted?

262
00:09:42,698 --> 00:09:44,065
Nope, he let me have her.

263
00:09:44,066 --> 00:09:46,067
I have to say, it was pretty noble of him.

264
00:09:46,068 --> 00:09:49,504
He fell on his sword so
that she could fall on mine.

265
00:09:49,505 --> 00:09:53,141
I won't bore you with the details,
but to summarize...

266
00:09:58,948 --> 00:10:00,649
She hugged me.

267
00:10:00,650 --> 00:10:02,384
What was that all about?

268
00:10:02,385 --> 00:10:03,718
Zoey's in love with Ted.

269
00:10:03,719 --> 00:10:04,953
Marcus!

270
00:10:04,954 --> 00:10:06,288
Wait, hear me out, Marshall.

271
00:10:06,289 --> 00:10:09,324
<i>Zoey's in love with Ted, but she's married,</i>

272
00:10:09,325 --> 00:10:11,059
<i>so she tried to push him away</i>

273
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:13,428
<i>by setting him up with her cousin instead.</i>

274
00:10:13,429 --> 00:10:15,564
<i>But seeing Ted and Honey hit it off was</i>

275
00:10:15,565 --> 00:10:17,065
<i>more than her gentle heart could bear,</i>

276
00:10:17,066 --> 00:10:20,835
<i>so Zoey left early,
pricked by love's fickle thorn.</i>

277
00:10:20,836 --> 00:10:22,537
<i>But then, the next morning, upon learning</i>

278
00:10:22,538 --> 00:10:25,740
<i>that Ted had not tasted of
Honey's sweet nectar,</i>

279
00:10:25,741 --> 00:10:29,945
<i>her joy burst forth like a
blossoming flower in spring.</i>

280
00:10:29,946 --> 00:10:31,947
Wow.

281
00:10:31,948 --> 00:10:34,316
Zoey's in love with Ted.

282
00:10:34,317 --> 00:10:38,587
Oh, Marshall, I stopped by that
new doughnut shop Hertz Donuts.

283
00:10:38,588 --> 00:10:40,522
Would you like a Hertz Donut?

284
00:10:40,523 --> 00:10:41,723
Sure.

285
00:10:47,129 --> 00:10:47,829
Hey, where's the...?

286
00:10:47,830 --> 00:10:49,497
No! Aah!

287
00:10:49,498 --> 00:10:50,698
Hurts, don't it?

288
00:10:53,636 --> 00:10:55,370
I can't believe you fell for that, bro.

289
00:10:55,371 --> 00:10:58,173
So Ted's in love with Zoey

290
00:10:58,174 --> 00:11:00,875
<i>and Zoey's in love with Ted?</i>

291
00:11:00,876 --> 00:11:02,544
Well, that-that's not going to work.

292
00:11:02,545 --> 00:11:04,179
I got to call Ted.

293
00:11:06,015 --> 00:11:07,215
Hello.

294
00:11:07,216 --> 00:11:08,350
Listen, Ted, um,

295
00:11:08,351 --> 00:11:10,452
I got to tell you something about Zoey.

296
00:11:10,453 --> 00:11:13,755
Yeah, yeah. I need to tell you
something about Zoey, too.

297
00:11:13,756 --> 00:11:16,424
Hey. I was in the neighborhood
and I thought I'd take you up

298
00:11:16,425 --> 00:11:18,259
on that beer you're about to offer me.

299
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:20,028
Can I get you a beer?

300
00:11:20,029 --> 00:11:22,030
Oh, Ted, I'm so busy.

301
00:11:22,031 --> 00:11:23,431
But I guess I got time for one.

302
00:11:23,432 --> 00:11:25,283
Lead the way.

303
00:11:28,938 --> 00:11:30,305
Oh, my God.

304
00:11:30,306 --> 00:11:31,589
What?!

305
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:33,441
Fridge full of ketchup? How?

306
00:11:33,442 --> 00:11:36,044
How, I ask you?

307
00:11:39,548 --> 00:11:41,449
What?

308
00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:45,120
Listen, Zoey, I, um...

309
00:11:46,922 --> 00:11:48,890
I need to tell you something.

310
00:11:48,891 --> 00:11:50,492
Um...

311
00:11:50,493 --> 00:11:52,427
Marshall, I'm going to Byerly's.
You want anything?

312
00:11:52,428 --> 00:11:54,295
Mom! Get off the phone!

313
00:11:54,296 --> 00:11:56,164
Could you get some more Bugles, please?

314
00:11:56,165 --> 00:11:57,098
Of course, dear.

315
00:11:57,099 --> 00:11:58,233
Marcus, hang up!

316
00:11:58,234 --> 00:12:00,235
Both of you, hang up!

317
00:12:00,236 --> 00:12:02,437
And we need ice cream.

318
00:12:03,856 --> 00:12:05,907
Go on.

319
00:12:05,908 --> 00:12:10,378
I, uh... I can't be
friends with you anymore.

320
00:12:11,414 --> 00:12:14,315
And this may seem strange, but...

321
00:12:14,316 --> 00:12:16,151
you can't ask me why.

322
00:12:16,152 --> 00:12:18,353
Wow.

323
00:12:20,156 --> 00:12:21,990
Okay.

324
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:29,164
And that was it.

325
00:12:29,165 --> 00:12:30,532
No more Zoey.

326
00:12:31,684 --> 00:12:33,101
Oh. Hey, buddy, that's Lily.

327
00:12:33,102 --> 00:12:34,502
I should take that.

328
00:12:34,503 --> 00:12:35,470
But, uh,

329
00:12:35,471 --> 00:12:37,138
you're a good guy, Ted.

330
00:12:38,007 --> 00:12:40,191
Hey, baby.

331
00:12:40,192 --> 00:12:41,476
We hate Ted now.

332
00:12:41,477 --> 00:12:43,712
Get on board or the sexting stops.

333
00:12:43,713 --> 00:12:46,181
Ted's a son of a bitch!

334
00:12:48,718 --> 00:12:50,651
Oh, nice.

335
00:12:50,652 --> 00:12:54,022
But, hey, um, baby, go easy on Ted, okay?

336
00:12:54,023 --> 00:12:56,357
He just, he just ended things with Zoey.

337
00:12:56,358 --> 00:12:57,592
Oh, I know.

338
00:12:57,593 --> 00:13:00,228
But did he tell you the whole story?

339
00:13:00,229 --> 00:13:04,466
I, uh, I can't be friends with you anymore.

340
00:13:05,534 --> 00:13:07,969
And you can't ask me why.

341
00:13:13,642 --> 00:13:14,709
Why?

342
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:16,978
Lily hates you.

343
00:13:18,531 --> 00:13:20,682
You hate me?

344
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:27,327
That's crazy. I don't hate you.

345
00:13:27,328 --> 00:13:30,830
Well, I know that's not true, Lily.
Ted told me everything.

346
00:13:30,831 --> 00:13:32,665
He... Oh, really?

347
00:13:32,666 --> 00:13:35,969
And-And what did Ted say, exactly?

348
00:13:35,970 --> 00:13:37,871
Lily hates you.

349
00:13:38,739 --> 00:13:41,608
She hates you so much

350
00:13:41,609 --> 00:13:44,411
it's hard to be around you.

351
00:13:45,746 --> 00:13:48,415
So we can't be friends.

352
00:13:48,416 --> 00:13:51,551
Oh, he... Oh, yeah.

353
00:13:51,552 --> 00:13:53,186
Yeah, okay, well,

354
00:13:53,187 --> 00:13:55,922
I- I guess there's no use hiding it anymore.

355
00:13:55,923 --> 00:13:57,957
I- I hate you.

356
00:13:57,958 --> 00:13:59,192
Bitch.

357
00:13:59,193 --> 00:14:01,728
I can't believe it.

358
00:14:01,729 --> 00:14:04,631
I really thought you and I were friends.

359
00:14:04,632 --> 00:14:06,266
Lord knows I could

360
00:14:06,267 --> 00:14:07,534
use a friend right now.

361
00:14:07,535 --> 00:14:10,203
I've been going through
some pretty difficult stuff.

362
00:14:10,204 --> 00:14:12,839
Difficult stuff? What difficult stuff?

363
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:13,840
I don't know.

364
00:14:13,841 --> 00:14:15,575
Well, you did the right thing, baby.

365
00:14:15,576 --> 00:14:17,911
Not entirely.

366
00:14:17,912 --> 00:14:20,213
Zoey, wait!

367
00:14:20,214 --> 00:14:21,748
I don't hate you!

368
00:14:21,749 --> 00:14:22,782
We just

369
00:14:22,783 --> 00:14:25,919
can't be friends anymore because...

370
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:27,754
Robin hates you.

371
00:14:29,590 --> 00:14:30,790
And that's Robin on the other line.

372
00:14:30,791 --> 00:14:32,058
Oh, well, I'll let you take that.

373
00:14:32,059 --> 00:14:33,026
Love you, baby!

374
00:14:33,027 --> 00:14:35,395
Eriksen residence, Marshall speaking.

375
00:14:35,396 --> 00:14:37,814
Listen, Robin. I know.
I apologize for my wife.

376
00:14:37,815 --> 00:14:39,165
She never should have...

377
00:14:39,166 --> 00:14:41,501
Yeah, I told Zoey you hate her.

378
00:14:41,502 --> 00:14:42,652
Me?

379
00:14:42,653 --> 00:14:44,270
You dragged me into this?!

380
00:14:44,271 --> 00:14:45,538
You just went through a tragedy.

381
00:14:45,539 --> 00:14:47,574
It's not like she's gonna call you up and...

382
00:14:48,709 --> 00:14:50,460
Oh, God, that's my other line.

383
00:14:50,461 --> 00:14:53,112
Oh, God, it's a 917 number,
and I don't recognize it!

384
00:14:53,113 --> 00:14:54,180
I think it's Zoey!

385
00:14:54,181 --> 00:14:55,348
Just don't answer it.

386
00:14:55,349 --> 00:14:57,517
I can't not answer. It's impolite.

387
00:14:57,518 --> 00:14:58,751
Marshall, you can beat this.
I can't turn my back

388
00:14:58,752 --> 00:15:00,019
on politeness. You don't have to answer.

389
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:01,554
You can just let it ring.
Good manners are what

390
00:15:01,555 --> 00:15:02,622
separate us from those
"elbows on the table" Wisconsinites.

391
00:15:02,623 --> 00:15:03,857
You can do this. I believe in you.

392
00:15:03,858 --> 00:15:06,192
Don't do it, Marshall! I'm sorry, Robin!

393
00:15:06,193 --> 00:15:08,061
Eriksen residence. Marshall speaking.

394
00:15:08,062 --> 00:15:11,164
Hi. I spent the night
with your friend Barney

395
00:15:11,165 --> 00:15:13,766
and he accidentally left his phone

396
00:15:13,767 --> 00:15:15,935
in my apartment, in the garbage.

397
00:15:15,936 --> 00:15:17,103
But I've been

398
00:15:17,104 --> 00:15:18,438
going through all of his contacts

399
00:15:18,439 --> 00:15:20,507
because I'm sure he wants
to get in touch with me.

400
00:15:21,208 --> 00:15:23,009
After all, he told me, uh...

401
00:15:23,010 --> 00:15:24,811
I was his first.

402
00:15:24,812 --> 00:15:26,846
Oh, honey.

403
00:15:26,847 --> 00:15:28,781
Oh! Honey!

404
00:15:28,782 --> 00:15:30,450
Zoey's cousin.

405
00:15:30,451 --> 00:15:31,718
Hi.

406
00:15:31,719 --> 00:15:32,752
Listen, um, about Barney...

407
00:15:32,753 --> 00:15:34,854
Oh, yeah. He's such a sweet guy.

408
00:15:34,855 --> 00:15:37,090
Who's your daddy?

409
00:15:37,091 --> 00:15:39,659
Oh...

410
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:41,127
Who's your daddy?

411
00:15:41,128 --> 00:15:43,863
I don't know.

412
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:49,102
I guess he recently decided
to get in touch with his dad.

413
00:15:49,103 --> 00:15:51,437
His mom gave him the guy's address.

414
00:15:51,438 --> 00:15:54,057
So I wrote him a letter.

415
00:15:54,058 --> 00:15:56,242
And I poured my heart out.

416
00:15:56,243 --> 00:15:59,979
And I gave him my number
and I told him to call me.

417
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:02,815
And he still hasn't called me.

418
00:16:02,816 --> 00:16:04,951
Oh, honey.

419
00:16:04,952 --> 00:16:06,953
I mean, I shouldn't be surprised.

420
00:16:06,954 --> 00:16:09,822
Clearly, he wants nothing to do with me.

421
00:16:09,823 --> 00:16:11,524
Oh, honey.

422
00:16:11,525 --> 00:16:13,326
I mean,

423
00:16:13,327 --> 00:16:16,563
why else would he let 30 years go by?

424
00:16:16,564 --> 00:16:17,997
He's ashamed

425
00:16:17,998 --> 00:16:20,833
to have me as a son.

426
00:16:20,834 --> 00:16:23,869
Oh, honey, he's not ashamed of you.

427
00:16:23,870 --> 00:16:26,639
He's ashamed of himself.

428
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:27,807
I mean, look at you.

429
00:16:27,808 --> 00:16:29,842
You're do so great without him.

430
00:16:29,843 --> 00:16:32,679
I mean, you have an airline

431
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:35,281
and three Nobel Prizes,

432
00:16:35,282 --> 00:16:37,584
and you play for the Yankees.

433
00:16:37,585 --> 00:16:40,353
Four. Four Nobel Prizes.

434
00:16:40,354 --> 00:16:42,255
Four. See?

435
00:16:42,256 --> 00:16:43,856
That is impressive.

436
00:16:43,857 --> 00:16:45,892
I mean, how many does he have?

437
00:16:45,893 --> 00:16:47,360
Only three.

438
00:16:47,361 --> 00:16:49,729
Well, there you go.

439
00:16:49,730 --> 00:16:53,066
Hey, uh, listen, Honey, while I've got you,

440
00:16:53,067 --> 00:16:56,169
do you have any idea what
kind of difficult stuff

441
00:16:56,170 --> 00:16:57,403
Zoey's been going through?

442
00:16:57,404 --> 00:16:59,272
Oh, I can't tell you about that.

443
00:16:59,273 --> 00:17:01,474
The only people that are allowed to know

444
00:17:01,475 --> 00:17:04,711
are me, Zoey and her therapist.

445
00:17:05,546 --> 00:17:07,714
I am her therapist.

446
00:17:07,715 --> 00:17:10,783
Oh! Well, in that case...

447
00:17:14,555 --> 00:17:17,757
Uh, okay, listen, I think we've
made great progress for today.

448
00:17:17,758 --> 00:17:20,109
I got to go. Bye.

449
00:17:21,395 --> 00:17:22,729
Mom! Marcus!

450
00:17:25,499 --> 00:17:27,300
What's this really about?

451
00:17:27,301 --> 00:17:29,002
I told you.

452
00:17:29,003 --> 00:17:30,403
Lily hates you.

453
00:17:30,404 --> 00:17:31,471
I think you hate me.

454
00:17:31,472 --> 00:17:33,373
I think you have some big problem with me,

455
00:17:33,374 --> 00:17:35,742
and you're too chicken
to come out and say it.

456
00:17:37,144 --> 00:17:38,544
All right.

457
00:17:38,545 --> 00:17:40,847
Yes.

458
00:17:40,848 --> 00:17:43,683
I... hate you.

459
00:17:43,684 --> 00:17:45,652
Great.

460
00:17:45,653 --> 00:17:47,887
See?

461
00:17:47,888 --> 00:17:49,422
Was that so hard?

462
00:17:53,727 --> 00:17:55,461
Zoey.

463
00:17:55,462 --> 00:17:56,962
Can you at least tell me why?

464
00:17:56,963 --> 00:17:58,631
Because I'm racking my brain here,

465
00:17:58,632 --> 00:18:00,132
and I thought...

466
00:18:01,368 --> 00:18:04,003
I just want to know why.

467
00:18:05,172 --> 00:18:08,641
So we got Ted and Zoey.
Ted is in love with Zoey.

468
00:18:08,642 --> 00:18:09,842
Zoey has no idea.

469
00:18:09,843 --> 00:18:12,612
Then Zoey's cousin Honey
went home with Barney,

470
00:18:12,613 --> 00:18:13,913
and Zoey was happy about it.

471
00:18:13,914 --> 00:18:15,081
Which tells us what?

472
00:18:15,082 --> 00:18:16,783
Zoey's in love with...

473
00:18:16,784 --> 00:18:18,651
Zoey's in love with Ted
and Ted doesn't know.

474
00:18:18,652 --> 00:18:20,620
So Ted and Zoey--
they're in love with each other,

475
00:18:20,621 --> 00:18:22,622
which would be fine if Zoey wasn't

476
00:18:22,623 --> 00:18:23,923
married to Colonel Mustard.

477
00:18:23,924 --> 00:18:25,324
I mean, The Captain.

478
00:18:26,126 --> 00:18:29,762
Except now, as Honey informs me...

479
00:18:29,763 --> 00:18:30,930
And we miss you.

480
00:18:30,931 --> 00:18:32,298
But the cousin thing mostly.

481
00:18:32,299 --> 00:18:33,433
Let's get that going.

482
00:18:33,434 --> 00:18:36,168
Fine, I will, uh, make it happen.

483
00:18:36,169 --> 00:18:38,838
Good-bye.

484
00:18:38,839 --> 00:18:42,141
Okay. Well...

485
00:18:42,142 --> 00:18:44,677
I guess I'll take it.

486
00:18:49,349 --> 00:18:53,586
Zoey and The Captain are getting divorced.

487
00:18:54,688 --> 00:18:56,055
Which means...?

488
00:18:56,056 --> 00:18:57,924
So help me, Marshall,

489
00:18:57,925 --> 00:19:02,428
if you don't call those two crazy,
mixed-up kids, I will.

490
00:19:02,429 --> 00:19:04,397
Give me that phone.

491
00:19:06,233 --> 00:19:07,366
Why do I hate you?

492
00:19:07,367 --> 00:19:08,534
Are you kidding?

493
00:19:08,535 --> 00:19:10,336
Uh, you're actively trying to prevent me

494
00:19:10,337 --> 00:19:11,571
from realizing a lifelong dream.

495
00:19:11,572 --> 00:19:12,805
So there's that.

496
00:19:12,806 --> 00:19:13,673
Plus, you're stubborn

497
00:19:13,674 --> 00:19:15,441
and-and-and argumentative.

498
00:19:15,442 --> 00:19:19,312
And what kind of name is Zoey, huh?

499
00:19:19,313 --> 00:19:21,080
What is that, short for Zoseph?

500
00:19:21,081 --> 00:19:23,082
Go on, get it.

501
00:19:23,083 --> 00:19:24,434
I'll have more in a second.

502
00:19:26,270 --> 00:19:27,687
Hello.

503
00:19:27,688 --> 00:19:29,772
Oh, hey, Marshall.

504
00:19:32,493 --> 00:19:34,694
Yes, I am.

505
00:19:36,697 --> 00:19:38,097
Yes, I am.

506
00:19:39,533 --> 00:19:41,801
He is?

507
00:19:44,471 --> 00:19:46,873
Bye.

508
00:19:46,874 --> 00:19:48,474
Why was Marshall calling?

509
00:19:48,475 --> 00:19:50,076
Don't worry about it. Go on.

510
00:19:50,077 --> 00:19:52,345
You talk during movies.

511
00:19:52,346 --> 00:19:53,346
You-You-You

512
00:19:53,347 --> 00:19:55,281
sneeze with your whole body.

513
00:19:55,282 --> 00:19:56,415
Uh, to my knowledge,

514
00:19:56,416 --> 00:19:58,684
you do not speak Portuguese.

515
00:19:58,685 --> 00:19:59,852
Well, actually...

516
00:20:02,256 --> 00:20:04,440
You're a show-off.

517
00:20:06,994 --> 00:20:09,428
You better take that.

518
00:20:12,783 --> 00:20:15,034
Uh, hey, Marshall, can I call you back?

519
00:20:15,035 --> 00:20:17,303
I'm out in the hallway with...

520
00:20:17,304 --> 00:20:19,906
She is?

521
00:20:23,243 --> 00:20:24,644
She is?

522
00:20:26,346 --> 00:20:30,338
Marshall, I got to go.

523
00:20:53,181 --> 00:20:54,833
They're kissing.

524
00:20:54,834 --> 00:20:55,798
They're kissing?!

525
00:20:55,980 --> 00:20:57,945
Yeah! They're kissing!

526
00:20:58,117 --> 00:21:00,800
They're kissing, Mom! They're kissing!
