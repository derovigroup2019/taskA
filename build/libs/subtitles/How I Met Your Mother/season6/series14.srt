1
00:00:14,014 --> 00:00:16,414
<i>Kids,</i>
<i>when your best friend loses someone...</i>

2
00:00:16,516 --> 00:00:18,074
My dad's dead?

3
00:00:19,419 --> 00:00:21,080
<i>You drop everything and rush to his side...</i>

4
00:00:21,187 --> 00:00:22,654
<i>only to find yourself...</i>

5
00:00:22,756 --> 00:00:25,020
<i>standing there with no idea</i>
<i>what to do or say.</i>

6
00:00:25,125 --> 00:00:27,025
This is the toughest time
in Marshall's life...

7
00:00:27,127 --> 00:00:29,027
and I feel absolutely useless.

8
00:00:29,129 --> 00:00:30,892
I mean, what can we do to help?

9
00:00:30,997 --> 00:00:32,464
Well, don't look at me. This morning...

10
00:00:32,565 --> 00:00:34,032
Marshall said, "I have to pee."

11
00:00:34,134 --> 00:00:36,068
And I said, "don't worry, baby.
I'll do it for you."

12
00:00:36,169 --> 00:00:39,161
Halfway through the pee, I'm, like,
"This doesn't even make sense."

13
00:00:39,272 --> 00:00:42,105
I've been to a couple funerals,
so I know my role.

14
00:00:42,208 --> 00:00:43,505
I'm vice girl.

15
00:00:43,610 --> 00:00:45,475
Whatever Marshall needs
to get through this day...

16
00:00:45,578 --> 00:00:47,045
I got it right here.

17
00:00:48,148 --> 00:00:50,241
- Whoa.
- Whoa.

18
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:51,817
Cigarettes, alcohol.

19
00:00:51,918 --> 00:00:53,385
Are these firecrackers?

20
00:00:53,486 --> 00:00:54,953
My God, Robin...

21
00:00:55,055 --> 00:00:57,523
you've somehow crammed
Tijuana into a purse.

22
00:00:58,425 --> 00:01:00,359
Be cool, nerds.

23
00:01:02,962 --> 00:01:04,520
Marshall's mom hasn't eaten...

24
00:01:04,631 --> 00:01:07,600
slept or sat down since we got here.

25
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:09,964
Wait. That could be my role.

26
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:11,765
I'll take care of Judy.

27
00:01:11,871 --> 00:01:15,034
Yeah, but doesn't Marshall's mom hate y...
the fact that you two aren't very close?

28
00:01:15,141 --> 00:01:16,768
Sweet save.

29
00:01:16,876 --> 00:01:19,401
Okay, yes. Judy and I aren't besties...

30
00:01:19,512 --> 00:01:21,742
but today, whatever she needs, I'm there.

31
00:01:21,848 --> 00:01:22,974
I'm on Judy duty.

32
00:01:23,983 --> 00:01:24,745
"Judy duty."

33
00:01:24,851 --> 00:01:25,818
She said "doody."

34
00:01:25,919 --> 00:01:27,887
Really, guys? At a funeral?

35
00:01:27,987 --> 00:01:29,215
Uh, okay.

36
00:01:29,322 --> 00:01:32,086
While not all of us possess
your lofty sense of decorum...

37
00:01:32,192 --> 00:01:33,955
drug dealer from an '80s
after-school special...

38
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:35,220
we have to laugh today.

39
00:01:35,328 --> 00:01:37,228
- It's healthy.
- Wait a minute.

40
00:01:37,330 --> 00:01:40,595
Today we are gonna make Marshall laugh.

41
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:41,496
How?

42
00:01:41,601 --> 00:01:42,693
Ted...

43
00:01:42,802 --> 00:01:44,463
what's the one thing
that always cracks him up?

44
00:01:44,571 --> 00:01:46,129
Internet footage of a guy
getting hit in the nuts.

45
00:01:46,239 --> 00:01:48,434
Internet footage of a guy
getting hit in the nuts. Exactly!

46
00:01:48,541 --> 00:01:51,772
So, we are gonna get our bro
a four-star nad-rattler.

47
00:01:51,878 --> 00:01:53,778
You search knees, feet, banisters...

48
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:55,347
fire hydrants and diving boards.

49
00:01:55,448 --> 00:01:57,245
And I'll cover bats,
rackets, hockey sticks...

50
00:01:57,350 --> 00:01:58,681
golf clubs and riding crops.

51
00:01:58,785 --> 00:02:00,480
- What about animals?
- Ah!

52
00:02:00,587 --> 00:02:02,054
Claws, paws, talons.

53
00:02:02,155 --> 00:02:03,884
Hooves, beaks and clenched monkey fists.

54
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:05,457
We can do this!

55
00:02:05,558 --> 00:02:07,025
Hey, guys. Sorry. Um...

56
00:02:07,127 --> 00:02:09,493
I left my charger back in New York,
so my phone's out of juice.

57
00:02:09,596 --> 00:02:11,257
- Does anyone have a...
- Outlet or USB?

58
00:02:12,332 --> 00:02:13,799
Uh, outlet. Thank you.

59
00:02:14,767 --> 00:02:16,200
Oh.

60
00:02:16,302 --> 00:02:19,100
- Hey, you really do have
everything in there, don't you?
- Mm-hmm.

61
00:02:19,205 --> 00:02:21,969
You're like Mary Poppins if her
magic purse was also filled with drugs.

62
00:02:22,075 --> 00:02:23,235
"lf"?

63
00:02:23,343 --> 00:02:26,039
Ted, the kids in that movie
jumped into a painting...

64
00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:28,580
and spent 15 minutes
chasing a cartoon fox.

65
00:02:28,681 --> 00:02:32,276
"Spoonful of sugar?"
Grow up.

66
00:02:34,254 --> 00:02:36,313
I'm so sorry for your loss, Judy.

67
00:02:36,422 --> 00:02:41,121
Thank you, Reverend. We're so happy
that you're going to lead the services today.

68
00:02:41,227 --> 00:02:43,195
Unfortunately, I can't.

69
00:02:43,296 --> 00:02:46,459
My daughter in Chicago
just went into labor.

70
00:02:46,566 --> 00:02:49,126
But I'm leaving you
in the capable hands...

71
00:02:49,235 --> 00:02:51,669
of my second-in-command... my son.

72
00:02:51,771 --> 00:02:53,864
Your son?

73
00:02:53,973 --> 00:02:56,237
Oh, you remember Trey. I'll go grab him.

74
00:02:58,411 --> 00:02:59,378
Guys...

75
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,778
Trey Platt terrorized me growing up.

76
00:03:02,882 --> 00:03:05,180
He was... He was
the toughest bully in school.

77
00:03:05,285 --> 00:03:07,253
What's up, Marshall?

78
00:03:08,288 --> 00:03:10,188
Hello, Trey.

79
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:11,757
Long time.

80
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:15,052
I was not aware
that you had become a reverend.

81
00:03:15,161 --> 00:03:17,220
Yeah, well, your lunch money
finally ran out.

82
00:03:17,997 --> 00:03:19,157
Kidding.

83
00:03:20,533 --> 00:03:23,400
Marshall Eriksen, you could use a laugh!

84
00:03:25,171 --> 00:03:26,968
This video is entitled...

85
00:03:27,073 --> 00:03:28,734
"Little League Coach
Gets Hit in the Nuts...

86
00:03:28,841 --> 00:03:31,002
by a Foul Ball and Then
Vomits in a Garbage Can."

87
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:33,578
I don't want to give anything away.
Let's just watch.

88
00:03:35,281 --> 00:03:37,340
Oh!

89
00:03:38,885 --> 00:03:41,410
- See, 'cause... 'cause he got hit...
- Right in the nuts.

90
00:03:41,521 --> 00:03:43,284
- And then the fat kid...
- The fat kid just keeps...

91
00:03:43,389 --> 00:03:44,913
- runs away.
- running away.

92
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:46,389
Trey Platt.

93
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:49,525
I can't believe
my father's funeral service...

94
00:03:49,629 --> 00:03:53,030
is being led by
Trey "the Noogie Machine" Platt.

95
00:03:53,132 --> 00:03:56,295
That guy gave you noogies?
What, did he carry a stepladder?

96
00:03:57,237 --> 00:03:58,704
He made me carry it.

97
00:04:00,006 --> 00:04:01,473
So my dad asks these questions...

98
00:04:01,574 --> 00:04:05,237
to help create a theme for the service,
or... whatever.

99
00:04:06,346 --> 00:04:07,608
Question one.

100
00:04:07,714 --> 00:04:09,739
"What were your last words
with the deceased?"

101
00:04:09,849 --> 00:04:11,111
Lame.

102
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:13,719
- Question two.
- Wait.

103
00:04:15,154 --> 00:04:17,384
My last words with Marvin were lovely.

104
00:04:17,490 --> 00:04:19,549
I've been thinking about them a lot.

105
00:04:19,659 --> 00:04:23,925
Me too. We went for a hike in the snow
and had this amazing talk.

106
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:27,295
My last day with Pop,
he taught my son how to skate.

107
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:32,901
Well, this is clearly yielding nothing.

108
00:04:33,006 --> 00:04:34,473
Thanks, Dad.

109
00:04:34,574 --> 00:04:37,270
Guess I'll have to fill the time
with some jokes... again!

110
00:04:39,012 --> 00:04:42,243
"Last words" seems like a good theme.

111
00:04:42,348 --> 00:04:45,408
Marshall, do you remember
the last thing your father said to you?

112
00:04:47,186 --> 00:04:49,017
- Bye, sweetie.
- Bye, Mom.

113
00:04:50,523 --> 00:04:51,581
Son...

114
00:04:52,759 --> 00:04:55,250
there's something
I want to say before I leave.

115
00:04:56,696 --> 00:04:58,027
Yeah, Dad?

116
00:04:59,899 --> 00:05:02,697
Could I snag
that extra pork chop for the flight?

117
00:05:03,903 --> 00:05:05,871
I was gonna make a sandwich
with that, Dad.

118
00:05:05,972 --> 00:05:07,940
- D'ah!
- Don't they have food on the plane?

119
00:05:08,041 --> 00:05:10,942
Yeah, but plane food is ass.

120
00:05:12,745 --> 00:05:14,804
"Plane food is ass."

121
00:05:16,749 --> 00:05:20,048
Those are the last words
my father will ever say to me.

122
00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:23,179
Right after I denied the man a pork chop.
Oh, God.

123
00:05:28,394 --> 00:05:30,362
- Ooh!
- Wait! I'm wrong!

124
00:05:30,463 --> 00:05:34,229
I'm wrong! That wasn't it.
They couldn't find a cab.

125
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:36,461
Hey! Marshall!
<i>So my dad called up from the street.</i>

126
00:05:36,569 --> 00:05:37,536
Marshall!

127
00:05:39,072 --> 00:05:40,903
Looks like rain out here!

128
00:05:41,007 --> 00:05:44,909
I couldn't find an umbrella
in your closet.

129
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:47,571
You know who probably has an umbrella?

130
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:51,081
<i>And then... Well, see,</i>
<i>my dad grew up in a small town...</i>

131
00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:54,745
<i>in another generation,</i>
<i>so sometimes, totally well-meaningly...</i>

132
00:05:54,854 --> 00:05:56,321
<i>he'd say stuff like...</i>

133
00:05:56,422 --> 00:05:59,482
The Koreans across the hall!

134
00:05:59,592 --> 00:06:02,823
Yeah, the Koreans are a trustworthy
and generous people.

135
00:06:02,929 --> 00:06:06,296
- Dad...
- I bet you one of the Koreans has an umbrella.

136
00:06:06,399 --> 00:06:08,833
l... Heck, they're Koreans!

137
00:06:11,404 --> 00:06:14,703
My dad's last words to me
were a string of...

138
00:06:14,807 --> 00:06:16,866
odd racial stereotypes.

139
00:06:16,976 --> 00:06:18,841
All that stuff was really nice.

140
00:06:18,945 --> 00:06:21,072
- Yeah, it's positive racism.
- Mmm.

141
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:24,013
This is worse than the pork chop.

142
00:06:25,318 --> 00:06:27,218
This next clip is entitled...

143
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:30,881
"Guy Playing Bagpipes Gets Hit in the Nuts
by Low-flying Seagull."

144
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:32,685
Let's see what happens.

145
00:06:32,792 --> 00:06:33,952
Let's take a...

146
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:35,755
Here...

147
00:06:35,862 --> 00:06:37,659
Here it comes, and here...

148
00:06:37,764 --> 00:06:39,527
- Oh!
- Oh!

149
00:06:41,634 --> 00:06:43,761
- 'Cause he gets hit...
- Right in the nuts.

150
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:46,361
And then... The fat kid just...

151
00:06:46,472 --> 00:06:48,906
- His swim trunks fall off.
- His shorts just fall right off.

152
00:06:49,008 --> 00:06:50,635
No, wait. I'm wrong.

153
00:06:50,743 --> 00:06:53,940
That wasn't it. They couldn't find a cab,
so I went down there.

154
00:06:54,046 --> 00:06:59,109
Hey. You were right.
The Kangs did, in fact, have an umbrella.

155
00:06:59,218 --> 00:07:01,880
- Of course they did.
- Bye, sweetie. Mwah!

156
00:07:05,224 --> 00:07:07,249
Hey, Son, uh...

157
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:10,557
I just want to leave you
with a little advice.

158
00:07:12,632 --> 00:07:16,500
Rent <i>Crocodile Dundee 3.</i>

159
00:07:16,602 --> 00:07:19,230
I caught it on the cable last night.
It totally holds up!

160
00:07:21,674 --> 00:07:25,542
<i>Crocodile Dundee 3</i> is the second-best
of the <i>Croc</i> trilogy, so...

161
00:07:25,645 --> 00:07:27,476
- You know, maybe I can live with that.
- Yeah.

162
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:30,071
Oh. Sorry. My phone's charged.

163
00:07:31,884 --> 00:07:35,251
I, uh... I hear you're
a woman who can get things.

164
00:07:35,354 --> 00:07:38,289
I have been known to locate
certain objects from time to time.

165
00:07:38,391 --> 00:07:41,292
I need vodka and dirty playing cards.

166
00:07:42,728 --> 00:07:43,695
I got you.

167
00:07:46,899 --> 00:07:48,298
Oh, my God.

168
00:07:48,401 --> 00:07:50,096
What is it?

169
00:07:52,004 --> 00:07:53,995
I have a voice mail from my dad.

170
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:03,681
- You have a voice mail from your dad?
- How?

171
00:08:03,783 --> 00:08:08,083
My phone's been out of juice, so he must
have called me the day that he, uh...

172
00:08:10,823 --> 00:08:12,984
Baby, are you okay?

173
00:08:13,092 --> 00:08:15,151
I hold in my hand...

174
00:08:15,261 --> 00:08:17,889
the last words
my father will ever say to me.

175
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:23,397
I'm gonna hit "play."

176
00:08:25,004 --> 00:08:26,665
What's wrong?

177
00:08:26,772 --> 00:08:29,707
What if it's worse
than <i>"Crocodile Dundee 3"?</i>

178
00:08:31,077 --> 00:08:34,376
I can't do this. I c...

179
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:36,414
My mom is about to collapse.

180
00:08:36,516 --> 00:08:38,950
- I'm gonna take...
- No, no, baby. Baby, I got it. Let me.

181
00:08:41,153 --> 00:08:42,780
You know, you should listen to it.

182
00:08:42,889 --> 00:08:44,823
Just don't put too much pressure on it.

183
00:08:44,924 --> 00:08:46,824
She's right. I mean, this idea that...

184
00:08:46,926 --> 00:08:49,394
someone's last words have to be
profound and meaningful...

185
00:08:49,495 --> 00:08:51,053
I mean, who can live up to that?

186
00:08:51,163 --> 00:08:52,391
Exactly.

187
00:08:52,498 --> 00:08:54,398
All those "famous last words"
people supposedly said...

188
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:55,899
they're all made-up.

189
00:08:56,002 --> 00:09:00,564
Like that patriotic dude,
Nathan Hale, from third-grade history?

190
00:09:00,673 --> 00:09:02,334
My only regret...

191
00:09:02,441 --> 00:09:05,774
is I have but one life to lose
for my country.

192
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:09,279
You know what his real last words were?

193
00:09:09,382 --> 00:09:11,873
I'm peeing my pants!

194
00:09:12,785 --> 00:09:14,685
True story.

195
00:09:14,787 --> 00:09:17,950
The point is, last words are overrated.

196
00:09:18,057 --> 00:09:19,786
Look, think of it this way.

197
00:09:19,892 --> 00:09:23,020
You get to hear
your dad's voice one last time.

198
00:09:23,129 --> 00:09:26,121
I should go listen to this... alone.

199
00:09:26,232 --> 00:09:27,460
- Yeah.
- Okay? I'll be right back.

200
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:28,534
Okay.

201
00:09:32,204 --> 00:09:33,535
Hey.

202
00:09:33,639 --> 00:09:35,539
So, um, I heard you might have...

203
00:09:35,641 --> 00:09:37,268
You heard right.

204
00:09:37,376 --> 00:09:39,071
I'm getting a reputation.

205
00:09:40,613 --> 00:09:42,274
So what you need, mama? Come here.

206
00:09:45,151 --> 00:09:47,619
Guys, listen to what just happened.

207
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:51,656
Judy, do you need a break?
I'm happy to cook for a while.

208
00:09:51,757 --> 00:09:55,249
You think your snobby New York cooking
is better than mine!

209
00:09:55,361 --> 00:09:57,556
Admit it! Well, go ahead, Lily!

210
00:09:57,663 --> 00:10:03,659
Why don't you just whip up a batch
of your fancy tofu-sushi bagels...

211
00:10:03,769 --> 00:10:05,760
and choke on them!

212
00:10:05,871 --> 00:10:07,600
- Whoa.
- Are you okay?

213
00:10:07,707 --> 00:10:08,605
Listen.

214
00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:14,241
I'm gonna go take a nap.

215
00:10:14,347 --> 00:10:17,407
Judy's finally sleeping,
and it's all because of me.

216
00:10:17,516 --> 00:10:21,077
Guys, I have a role.
I'm Judy's bitch! Yeah!

217
00:10:21,187 --> 00:10:25,351
Well... But this day is tough on you too.
You sure you can absorb all that?

218
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:28,120
Yeah! Robin gave me
a little orange pill from her purse.

219
00:10:28,227 --> 00:10:31,628
I don't know what's in it, but things
are flowing pretty smooth right now.

220
00:10:31,731 --> 00:10:33,096
Hey. Stay hydrated.

221
00:10:34,734 --> 00:10:36,133
Hey.

222
00:10:36,235 --> 00:10:37,532
So?

223
00:10:38,771 --> 00:10:41,797
I couldn't listen to it.
Guys, this is hard.

224
00:10:41,907 --> 00:10:44,933
We know, baby,
but you'll always wonder if you don't.

225
00:10:45,044 --> 00:10:48,605
Your dad loved you.
It almost doesn't matter what he said.

226
00:10:48,714 --> 00:10:50,614
- It doesn't matter.
- Guys... Guys...

227
00:10:50,716 --> 00:10:54,277
What if, God forbid,
all of your dads died right now?

228
00:10:55,955 --> 00:10:58,719
What would their last words
to you have been? Seriously.

229
00:10:59,725 --> 00:11:00,987
I know mine.

230
00:11:01,093 --> 00:11:03,357
When I was in Cleveland last month...

231
00:11:03,462 --> 00:11:05,794
I went to visit my dad at his...

232
00:11:05,898 --> 00:11:08,628
post-divorce bachelor pad.

233
00:11:08,734 --> 00:11:12,295
Been fun bro-in' out
with you tonight, T-Dawg.

234
00:11:12,405 --> 00:11:13,838
Yeah.

235
00:11:13,939 --> 00:11:16,499
I'm so glad we can talk about
our sex lives now.

236
00:11:16,609 --> 00:11:19,601
That's totally an improvement.

237
00:11:19,712 --> 00:11:22,203
I hooked up with a younger woman
the other week.

238
00:11:22,314 --> 00:11:24,748
Donna Bromstead.

239
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:26,317
My prom date?

240
00:11:27,186 --> 00:11:29,086
How far did you get, T-Dawg?

241
00:11:31,090 --> 00:11:32,853
I have to go.

242
00:11:35,761 --> 00:11:38,821
How would you like those to be
your father's last words?

243
00:11:38,931 --> 00:11:42,367
Well, they might be.
Donna Bromstead's husband is a cop.

244
00:11:47,273 --> 00:11:48,365
Lawyered.

245
00:11:50,376 --> 00:11:51,001
Lily.

246
00:11:52,144 --> 00:11:54,772
Hello?

247
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,780
<i>Lily? It's Dad.</i>

248
00:11:56,882 --> 00:12:00,613
<i>Listen, I'm sort of in jail for not paying</i>
<i>taxes for the last 25 years...</i>

249
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:03,211
<i>but... bright side...</i>
<i>I thought of a great new board game...</i>

250
00:12:03,322 --> 00:12:06,052
<i>Tax Evasion. Ages six to 10.</i>

251
00:12:06,158 --> 00:12:08,820
<i>Which is ironically</i>
<i>what I might be looking at.</i>

252
00:12:08,928 --> 00:12:12,022
<i>Anyway, pumpkin, I need $15,000.</i>

253
00:12:12,131 --> 00:12:13,598
Fooled ya!

254
00:12:13,699 --> 00:12:16,793
Leave a message after the beep.
We'll get back to ya.

255
00:12:16,902 --> 00:12:19,393
Beep.

256
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:23,936
Lawyered.

257
00:12:25,644 --> 00:12:27,805
Robin.

258
00:12:27,913 --> 00:12:31,371
And so, despite the endless
disappointment you've caused me...

259
00:12:31,484 --> 00:12:34,749
I pray that this will
finally be the year...

260
00:12:34,854 --> 00:12:38,017
that you achieve something
of actual significance.

261
00:12:38,124 --> 00:12:40,922
I'd love to stop lying to my friends
about you being in a coma.

262
00:12:42,661 --> 00:12:45,255
Anyway, point is...

263
00:12:45,364 --> 00:12:46,854
happy birthday, R.J.

264
00:12:46,966 --> 00:12:48,433
- Ooh. Wow!
- God.

265
00:12:48,534 --> 00:12:51,560
- That's awful.
- Nope. Here's the awful part.

266
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:54,833
You remembered my birthday!

267
00:12:57,943 --> 00:13:00,002
Lawyered.

268
00:13:00,112 --> 00:13:02,842
Now, can we all just admit
that last words...

269
00:13:02,948 --> 00:13:04,643
are, in fact, a big deal?

270
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:06,411
- Yes.
- Yes.

271
00:13:06,519 --> 00:13:09,181
Man. I always thought I had it rough...

272
00:13:09,288 --> 00:13:11,756
not really knowing my dad, but...

273
00:13:11,857 --> 00:13:16,294
now I realize at least I'll never
have to suffer like this.

274
00:13:16,395 --> 00:13:19,728
Our next video is called " German Shepherd
Activates Tennis Ball Cannon...

275
00:13:19,832 --> 00:13:21,823
- While Fat Kid Sips Energy Drink."
- Okay, Barney...

276
00:13:21,934 --> 00:13:25,267
Please, and, Barney,
no more videos, okay? I'm just...

277
00:13:25,371 --> 00:13:27,168
I just need a minute.

278
00:13:28,707 --> 00:13:32,438
Okay. Okay, who is responsible for this?

279
00:13:32,545 --> 00:13:34,979
Who got Cousin Daphne drunk?

280
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:37,344
She is 15 years old!

281
00:13:37,449 --> 00:13:39,440
Whoa! They grown 'em big out here.

282
00:13:39,552 --> 00:13:41,611
And here's your phone number back.

283
00:13:44,523 --> 00:13:47,151
- Judy, l...
- l-I did it.

284
00:13:47,259 --> 00:13:51,059
What possible excuse
could you have for this?

285
00:13:51,163 --> 00:13:54,690
I'm from New York.
We think getting minors drunk is funny.

286
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:58,258
There's nothing funny
about getting minors drunk!

287
00:13:58,370 --> 00:14:00,600
You should be ashamed, Lily!

288
00:14:00,706 --> 00:14:01,832
Ashamed!

289
00:14:05,244 --> 00:14:08,008
Mmm! Oh, boy, it's so tasty.

290
00:14:08,113 --> 00:14:09,580
Mmm! Mmm!

291
00:14:09,682 --> 00:14:13,550
That salad's the first food
she's eaten in two days.

292
00:14:13,652 --> 00:14:16,815
Sure, it's mostly cheese, mayonnaise
and jelly beans, but it counts.

293
00:14:16,922 --> 00:14:18,480
Well, at least someone's helping.

294
00:14:18,591 --> 00:14:20,422
We haven't made Marshall laugh once.

295
00:14:20,526 --> 00:14:22,050
Yeah.

296
00:14:22,161 --> 00:14:25,722
Showing videos of guys getting hit
in the nuts wasn't gonna do anything.

297
00:14:25,831 --> 00:14:27,594
- That was just stupid.
- Stupid.

298
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:30,669
What we need to do is
hit <i>each other</i> in the nuts.

299
00:14:30,769 --> 00:14:32,964
Yes!

300
00:14:33,072 --> 00:14:35,233
Nothing beats the immediacy
of live theater!

301
00:14:35,341 --> 00:14:37,809
But which one of us is gonna take the hit?

302
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:39,844
- Hey, Marshall.
- Mm.

303
00:14:39,945 --> 00:14:41,435
Ooh!

304
00:14:41,547 --> 00:14:43,811
So that's it? No discussion?

305
00:14:46,619 --> 00:14:48,348
I'm not gonna listen.

306
00:14:48,454 --> 00:14:50,354
"Rent <i>Crocodile Dundee 3"...</i>

307
00:14:50,456 --> 00:14:54,916
are the last words
that my father will ever say to me, and...

308
00:14:55,027 --> 00:14:56,995
I think I can live with that.

309
00:14:58,230 --> 00:15:00,562
Is he laughing?

310
00:15:00,666 --> 00:15:03,794
<i>And Marshall</i>
<i>really did think he could live with that.</i>

311
00:15:03,936 --> 00:15:06,700
<i>That is, until later,</i>
<i>at the memorial service.</i>

312
00:15:06,805 --> 00:15:09,865
My last talk with Marvin...

313
00:15:09,975 --> 00:15:12,341
was so lovely.

314
00:15:12,444 --> 00:15:16,039
<i>The stories his mother</i>
<i>and brothers told were so perfect.</i>

315
00:15:16,148 --> 00:15:18,446
Then he picked my crying son
up off the ice...

316
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:20,245
he gave him a hug and said...

317
00:15:20,352 --> 00:15:23,913
"Champ, it doesn't matter
if you fall down once in a while."

318
00:15:24,023 --> 00:15:25,490
And as we hiked...

319
00:15:25,591 --> 00:15:27,718
a little deer appeared on the path.

320
00:15:27,826 --> 00:15:30,124
She hopped over to Dad
and started eating...

321
00:15:30,229 --> 00:15:32,720
right out of his hand.

322
00:15:32,831 --> 00:15:34,856
And then he kissed me.

323
00:15:34,967 --> 00:15:36,434
And he said...

324
00:15:36,535 --> 00:15:38,765
"I will always be proud of you."

325
00:15:38,871 --> 00:15:41,066
"Life is such a gift."

326
00:15:41,173 --> 00:15:43,869
"You know something, gorgeous?

327
00:15:43,976 --> 00:15:47,104
I'm the luckiest man alive."

328
00:15:49,081 --> 00:15:50,241
Lame.

329
00:15:50,349 --> 00:15:51,907
These stories suck.

330
00:15:52,017 --> 00:15:55,646
It doesn't hold a candle
to your <i>Crocodile Dundee</i> thing.

331
00:15:55,754 --> 00:15:57,346
Mm-mmm.

332
00:15:57,456 --> 00:15:59,048
He reminded me to slow down.

333
00:15:59,158 --> 00:16:01,092
You're up next, baby.

334
00:16:04,063 --> 00:16:06,031
I just need some air.

335
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:13,131
Baby, are you okay?

336
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:16,871
I have to listen to it.

337
00:16:31,090 --> 00:16:32,614
It's a pocket dial.

338
00:16:34,493 --> 00:16:36,984
It's nothing.

339
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:49,873
Okay, so it's a pocket dial.

340
00:16:49,975 --> 00:16:53,138
You know, you have so many
great memories with your dad.

341
00:16:53,245 --> 00:16:55,076
Who cares about the last one?

342
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:56,977
She's right.

343
00:16:57,082 --> 00:16:58,811
You guys don't get it, okay?

344
00:16:58,917 --> 00:17:00,851
None of you do.

345
00:17:02,421 --> 00:17:03,888
My dad was my hero.

346
00:17:05,357 --> 00:17:07,552
And he was my teacher.

347
00:17:07,659 --> 00:17:09,559
And he was my best friend.

348
00:17:12,064 --> 00:17:14,055
He always came through for me.

349
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:16,891
And now he's just gone.

350
00:17:18,637 --> 00:17:20,195
And what am I left with?

351
00:17:24,643 --> 00:17:26,668
Thanks a lot, God!

352
00:17:26,779 --> 00:17:27,837
Thank you.

353
00:17:27,946 --> 00:17:30,414
You took my father.

354
00:17:30,516 --> 00:17:33,542
The greatest man that I have ever known.

355
00:17:33,652 --> 00:17:36,678
And you ripped him off this earth
way too young.

356
00:17:38,724 --> 00:17:40,851
And he'll never get to meet
our kids, Lily.

357
00:17:43,896 --> 00:17:45,420
But we got this voice mail.

358
00:17:47,466 --> 00:17:50,526
Thank you so much for the voice mail.
It's a great comfort!

359
00:17:50,636 --> 00:17:53,070
'Cause whenever I'm starting
to feel Ionely...

360
00:17:53,172 --> 00:17:57,108
or sad or... or you know what...
or maybe a little bit cheated...

361
00:17:57,209 --> 00:17:59,871
at least I got the sound
of his pocket to console me.

362
00:17:59,978 --> 00:18:02,469
- Marshall...
- How is this fair?

363
00:18:02,581 --> 00:18:06,142
You know, like, an entire human life...

364
00:18:06,251 --> 00:18:08,947
and it just ends for no reason.

365
00:18:09,054 --> 00:18:10,715
And...

366
00:18:10,823 --> 00:18:12,723
And what are we left with?

367
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:16,791
<i>Marshall?</i>

368
00:18:16,895 --> 00:18:19,887
<i>Ohl Looks like I've been calling you</i>
<i>for almost five minutes.</i>

369
00:18:19,998 --> 00:18:22,228
<i>How's my pocket sound?</i>

370
00:18:22,334 --> 00:18:25,565
<i>Oh, sorry about that, buddy.</i>

371
00:18:25,671 --> 00:18:30,040
<i>Um, anyway, your mom and I</i>
<i>had such a great time seeing you.</i>

372
00:18:30,142 --> 00:18:32,110
<i>I love you.</i>

373
00:18:36,014 --> 00:18:37,948
Looks like your dad came through
one last time.

374
00:18:47,159 --> 00:18:49,218
"I love you."

375
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:53,428
My father's last words to me
are "I love you."

376
00:18:54,733 --> 00:18:57,031
<i>Ooh. And let me know</i>
<i>if you find my foot cream.</i>

377
00:18:57,136 --> 00:18:59,263
<i>That fungus thing is acting up again.</i>

378
00:19:03,609 --> 00:19:05,201
"I love you."

379
00:19:06,778 --> 00:19:08,837
My father's last words to me
are "I love you."

380
00:19:08,947 --> 00:19:10,938
- Yes, they were.
- We heard it, yeah.

381
00:19:11,049 --> 00:19:12,778
Loud and clear.

382
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:16,620
Bye, Pop.

383
00:19:18,924 --> 00:19:20,687
<i>So Marshall finally got up to speak.</i>

384
00:19:20,792 --> 00:19:22,692
<i>Funny thing though...</i>

385
00:19:22,794 --> 00:19:25,627
And then my father said
the last words that he'll ever say to me:

386
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:30,996
"Rent <i>Crocodile Dundee 3.</i>

387
00:19:31,103 --> 00:19:34,504
I caught it on the cable last night,
and it totally holds up."

388
00:19:36,041 --> 00:19:38,976
<i>He decided to keep</i>
<i>Marvin's real last words just for himself.</i>

389
00:19:39,077 --> 00:19:41,477
Thanks.

390
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:42,877
For what?

391
00:19:42,981 --> 00:19:45,882
I know what you've been doing today.

392
00:19:45,984 --> 00:19:48,680
And I really needed it.

393
00:19:48,787 --> 00:19:50,277
Anytime.

394
00:19:52,324 --> 00:19:55,384
That dress makes you look
like a Kansas City whore.

395
00:19:56,728 --> 00:19:58,787
Sorry, dear. Last one.

396
00:20:03,368 --> 00:20:05,962
Oh, man.

397
00:20:06,071 --> 00:20:08,505
I should have rented <i>Crocodile Dundee 3.</i>

398
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:12,935
Okay, seriously, how are you doing that?

399
00:20:15,948 --> 00:20:16,915
Thanks.

400
00:20:17,950 --> 00:20:20,009
I'll be right back.

401
00:20:24,122 --> 00:20:28,252
And if I don't come back, well,
then these are my last words to you all.

402
00:20:30,829 --> 00:20:33,730
I really, really, really love you guys.

403
00:20:36,235 --> 00:20:37,759
And I'm gonna go drop a deuce.

404
00:20:37,869 --> 00:20:40,337
Oh, you ruined it!

405
00:20:40,439 --> 00:20:42,930
<i>Last words. It's a lot of pressure, kids.</i>

406
00:20:43,041 --> 00:20:44,736
<i># And what do we know #</i>

407
00:20:44,843 --> 00:20:47,778
- <i>It gets you thinking.</i>
- <i># About what we've learned? #</i>

408
00:20:47,879 --> 00:20:50,575
Hi, Dad.

409
00:20:51,650 --> 00:20:53,049
Hi, Dad.

410
00:20:53,885 --> 00:20:55,352
Hi, Dad.

411
00:20:56,421 --> 00:20:58,082
Hey, Mom.

412
00:21:00,092 --> 00:21:02,390
I'm ready to meet my dad.

413
00:21:30,856 --> 00:21:31,823
English - US - SDH
