1
00:00:01,534 --> 00:00:03,434
<i>In December of 2010...</i>

2
00:00:03,536 --> 00:00:06,767
<i>my friends and I decided to go see</i>
It's a Wonderful Life <i>on the big screen.</i>

3
00:00:06,873 --> 00:00:08,807
<i>It seemed like something</i>
<i>we all needed.</i>

4
00:00:08,908 --> 00:00:11,900
<i>After all, it had been</i>
<i>a crazy couple days.</i>

5
00:00:12,012 --> 00:00:14,981
<i>It all started with a pregnancy test.</i>

6
00:00:15,081 --> 00:00:18,175
This is taking forever.
Are you sure you did it right?

7
00:00:18,284 --> 00:00:20,844
Is there a wrong way
to pee on a stick?

8
00:00:22,422 --> 00:00:25,858
Can I ask you a question that's
plagued me for years? Can girls aim?

9
00:00:25,959 --> 00:00:27,824
Um, can <i>boys</i> aim?

10
00:00:27,927 --> 00:00:31,556
'Cause it seems to me like I'm takin' a mop
to that bathroom floor every two days.

11
00:00:31,664 --> 00:00:34,360
Okay, you're the one who put
the Far Side calendar up over the toilet.

12
00:00:34,467 --> 00:00:36,765
You know I laugh
with my whole body.

13
00:00:37,937 --> 00:00:40,064
It's been two minutes.

14
00:00:42,776 --> 00:00:45,745
One, two, three.

15
00:00:46,679 --> 00:00:48,044
It's positive.

16
00:00:48,148 --> 00:00:49,445
It's positive?
It's positive?

17
00:00:49,549 --> 00:00:51,210
- It's positive.
- It's positive? It's positive!

18
00:00:51,317 --> 00:00:53,410
It's positive!

19
00:00:55,455 --> 00:00:57,855
- I'm pregnant.
- What?

20
00:00:57,957 --> 00:01:00,016
I've never seen
that woman before in my life.

21
00:01:00,126 --> 00:01:02,219
Sorry. Force of habit.
Congratulations!

22
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:05,222
To Lily and Marshall.

23
00:01:05,331 --> 00:01:07,526
- To Lily and Marshall.
- Well, thank you.

24
00:01:07,634 --> 00:01:09,295
- We've never been happier.
- Mmm.

25
00:01:09,402 --> 00:01:12,200
Can't imagine anything
bringing me down right now.

26
00:01:12,305 --> 00:01:14,466
You're not pregnant.

27
00:01:14,574 --> 00:01:16,701
Well, that did it.

28
00:01:29,756 --> 00:01:31,553
<i>Kids, this is the story...</i>

29
00:01:31,658 --> 00:01:33,888
<i>of the 36 hours we all thought</i>
<i>Lily was pregnant...</i>

30
00:01:33,993 --> 00:01:36,291
<i>and how it caused each of us</i>
<i>to reexamine our own lives.</i>

31
00:01:36,396 --> 00:01:37,795
<i>Because while this was happening...</i>

32
00:01:37,897 --> 00:01:39,296
Are you sure you did it right?

33
00:01:39,399 --> 00:01:41,993
<i>I was on the phone with Punchy,</i>
<i>my best friend from high school...</i>

34
00:01:42,102 --> 00:01:44,229
<i>who had recently asked me</i>
<i>to be his best man.</i>

35
00:01:44,337 --> 00:01:46,237
Yeah, Punchy, I've given this
some serious thought.

36
00:01:46,339 --> 00:01:49,069
I think I know how we can crush
these floral arrangements.

37
00:01:49,175 --> 00:01:50,904
Here it comes.
Hit me up, Schmos.

38
00:01:51,010 --> 00:01:55,276
Peonies, lavender blossoms
with a halo of baby's breath...

39
00:01:55,381 --> 00:01:57,474
for an ambience
of springtime rejuvenation.

40
00:01:57,584 --> 00:01:59,017
Crushed it!

41
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:02,418
That's exactly the accent of whimsy
this celebration of love needs!

42
00:02:02,522 --> 00:02:04,649
It's gonna be a magical day.

43
00:02:05,892 --> 00:02:08,986
I know what you're thinkin'.
"I wish I was a dude."

44
00:02:09,095 --> 00:02:10,960
I do wish you were a dude.

45
00:02:11,064 --> 00:02:14,431
Because if I was a dude, I could
have Ted Mosby as my best man.

46
00:02:14,534 --> 00:02:15,933
No. And here's why.

47
00:02:16,035 --> 00:02:17,935
Ted, the best man's job...

48
00:02:18,037 --> 00:02:21,370
is not to crush
the floral arrangements.

49
00:02:21,474 --> 00:02:23,942
It's to get the groom
down the aisle.

50
00:02:24,043 --> 00:02:26,944
Because no matter who he is,
he will freak out.

51
00:02:27,046 --> 00:02:29,446
I just don't think you have what
it takes to get that soldier...

52
00:02:29,549 --> 00:02:31,449
to pick up his rifle
and charge up the hill.

53
00:02:31,551 --> 00:02:34,782
Uh, are you forgetting? I've done this before.
I was Marshall's best man.

54
00:02:34,888 --> 00:02:36,287
And how did that go again?

55
00:02:36,389 --> 00:02:39,449
No!

56
00:02:39,559 --> 00:02:41,186
0 for 1.

57
00:02:41,294 --> 00:02:43,057
Oh, come on.
That wasn't my fault.

58
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:45,631
And need I remind you,
I gave a beautiful toast.

59
00:02:45,732 --> 00:02:48,394
Ted.

60
00:02:48,501 --> 00:02:52,335
O, do you take One to be
your lawfully wedded wife?

61
00:02:52,438 --> 00:02:54,201
Oh, God, I'm freakin' out.

62
00:02:54,307 --> 00:02:56,571
Why did I choose Ted
to be my best man?

63
00:02:56,676 --> 00:02:58,940
Uh, yeah, it's hard to
take criticism from someone...

64
00:02:59,045 --> 00:03:02,481
who just recorded seven episodes
of <i>Million Dollar Heads or Tails.</i>

65
00:03:02,582 --> 00:03:05,881
<i>Kids,</i> Million Dollar Heads or Tails
<i>was an extremely popular show...</i>

66
00:03:05,985 --> 00:03:07,885
<i>with an extremely simple premise.</i>

67
00:03:07,987 --> 00:03:11,115
All right, your practice flip
came up tails...

68
00:03:11,224 --> 00:03:15,752
but our Vegas oddsmaker
tells us that the next toss is still just 50-50.

69
00:03:15,862 --> 00:03:19,093
And so, Jordan,
for one million dollars...

70
00:03:20,166 --> 00:03:22,862
heads or tails?

71
00:03:22,969 --> 00:03:26,268
Tails! Heads! Tails!

72
00:03:26,372 --> 00:03:28,533
What was the year
of the coin again?

73
00:03:28,641 --> 00:03:30,165
Why the sudden obsession
with <i>Heads or Tails?</i>

74
00:03:30,276 --> 00:03:35,179
Well, it turns out that <i>Heads or Tails</i>
has a job opening.

75
00:03:35,281 --> 00:03:37,442
- Heads! Tails!
- Ta... Heads.

76
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:39,848
Marni, flip that coin.

77
00:03:43,056 --> 00:03:46,219
So now because of that incident,
<i>Heads or Tails</i> is looking for a new...

78
00:03:46,326 --> 00:03:48,226
"currency rotation specialist."

79
00:03:48,328 --> 00:03:51,422
- You mean "coin flip bimbo"?
- They're not bimbos.

80
00:03:52,332 --> 00:03:54,232
You auditioned, didn't you?

81
00:03:58,972 --> 00:04:01,532
- And you're Canadian?
- Mm-hmm.

82
00:04:01,641 --> 00:04:05,668
Robin, aside from that coin, this is
the other thing that's flipping right now.

83
00:04:05,778 --> 00:04:09,373
What is my lid for you?

84
00:04:09,482 --> 00:04:11,313
You're the new coin flip bimbo?

85
00:04:11,417 --> 00:04:13,112
Currency rotation specialist.

86
00:04:13,219 --> 00:04:15,517
Robin, you better check yourself...

87
00:04:15,622 --> 00:04:18,785
before you Trebek yourself.

88
00:04:18,891 --> 00:04:22,452
- You're a journalist.
What is the matter with you?
- It's a national audience.

89
00:04:22,562 --> 00:04:24,894
I get to wear shiny dresses.

90
00:04:24,998 --> 00:04:27,228
Robin, have you forgotten about
your New Year's resolution?

91
00:04:27,333 --> 00:04:31,167
I'm never drinking again.

92
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:32,397
No, before that.

93
00:04:32,505 --> 00:04:35,963
I am gonna finish
this whole bottle tonight.

94
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:38,238
Before that too.

95
00:04:38,344 --> 00:04:39,743
I moved here...

96
00:04:39,846 --> 00:04:43,111
to work for a big-time cable news channel
like World Wide News.

97
00:04:43,216 --> 00:04:45,741
Well, by this time next year...

98
00:04:45,852 --> 00:04:49,811
I will be wearing a World Wide News
I.D. badge around my neck.

99
00:04:49,922 --> 00:04:51,822
And to show you that I'm serious...

100
00:04:51,924 --> 00:04:54,119
this is my first
and only drink of the night.

101
00:04:54,227 --> 00:04:55,990
- Okay.
- Okay?

102
00:04:58,064 --> 00:05:00,089
Oh, damn, that's smooth.

103
00:05:00,199 --> 00:05:02,759
I thought you finally got that interview
at World Wide News.

104
00:05:02,869 --> 00:05:04,393
Well, I did.

105
00:05:04,504 --> 00:05:08,133
But they only offered me a boring,
low-paid, off-camera research job.

106
00:05:08,241 --> 00:05:10,641
Which could be a stepping stone
to bigger things in your career.

107
00:05:10,743 --> 00:05:12,370
So could <i>Heads or Tails.</i>

108
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:14,708
The first currency rotation specialist...

109
00:05:14,814 --> 00:05:17,783
went on to be a semifinalist
on <i>The Bachelor.</i>

110
00:05:17,884 --> 00:05:21,445
And then she lost, like, a hundred pounds
on <i>The Biggest Loser.</i>

111
00:05:21,554 --> 00:05:24,022
And now she's totally winning
<i>Celebrity Rehab.</i>

112
00:05:24,123 --> 00:05:27,024
<i>It seemed like</i>
<i>there was no changing Robin's mind.</i>

113
00:05:27,126 --> 00:05:29,253
<i>But what we didn't realize</i>
<i>was that in a few minutes...</i>

114
00:05:29,362 --> 00:05:31,956
<i>our whole world was</i>
<i>going to be turned upside-down.</i>

115
00:05:32,065 --> 00:05:34,795
- I'm pregnant.
- What?

116
00:05:34,901 --> 00:05:37,802
<i>Now, kids, when your friends have</i>
<i>great news, you're happy for them...</i>

117
00:05:37,904 --> 00:05:39,337
<i>for, like, a millisecond.</i>

118
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:41,907
<i>And then you start</i>
<i>thinking about yourself.</i>

119
00:05:42,008 --> 00:05:45,136
<i>Oh, my God.</i>
<i>They're really having a baby.</i>

120
00:05:45,244 --> 00:05:47,144
<i>What am I doing with</i> my <i>life?</i>

121
00:05:47,246 --> 00:05:49,146
<i>Starting Monday,</i>
<i>I'm a currency rotation sp...</i>

122
00:05:49,248 --> 00:05:51,648
<i>Oh, who am I kidding?</i>
<i>I'm a coin flip bimbo.</i>

123
00:05:51,751 --> 00:05:53,378
And <i>I'm still single.</i>

124
00:05:53,486 --> 00:05:56,216
<i>Okay, let's not go there, Scherbatsky.</i>
<i>That's a whole other thing.</i>

125
00:05:56,322 --> 00:05:58,722
<i>I gotta take</i>
<i>that World Wide News job.</i>

126
00:05:58,825 --> 00:06:01,692
<i>And so the next night,</i>
<i>we had two things to celebrate.</i>

127
00:06:01,794 --> 00:06:06,925
Well, you are looking at the new associate
researcher at World Wide News.

128
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:08,830
Oh, my gosh! That's amazing news.

129
00:06:08,935 --> 00:06:11,733
- What changed your mind?
- Marshall and Lily.

130
00:06:11,838 --> 00:06:15,672
I just realized that I am about to have
a little niece who looks up to me...

131
00:06:15,775 --> 00:06:17,675
and I don't wanna be sad Aunt Robin...

132
00:06:17,777 --> 00:06:20,177
the aging coin flip bimbo
who gives her the creeps.

133
00:06:20,279 --> 00:06:22,372
I wanna be cool Aunt Robin...

134
00:06:22,482 --> 00:06:24,609
the respected journalist
who gives her beer.

135
00:06:24,717 --> 00:06:27,015
- What?
- What? Oh...

136
00:06:28,187 --> 00:06:30,849
I have never seen you guys
looking so at peace.

137
00:06:30,957 --> 00:06:32,891
To Lily and Marshall.

138
00:06:32,992 --> 00:06:35,256
- To Lily and Marshall.
- Well, thank you.

139
00:06:35,361 --> 00:06:37,454
I mean, we've never been happier.

140
00:06:37,563 --> 00:06:41,522
<i>The next day, Robin called</i>
Heads or Tails <i>to respectfully decline.</i>

141
00:06:41,634 --> 00:06:44,364
Hi. Mr. Trebek, um,
this is Robin Scherbatsky.

142
00:06:44,470 --> 00:06:46,529
<i>- But at that moment...</i>
- You're not pregnant.

143
00:06:47,974 --> 00:06:51,034
As honored as I am by the offer, um...

144
00:06:53,212 --> 00:06:56,409
<i>Oh, my God.</i>
<i>They're not having a baby.</i>

145
00:06:56,516 --> 00:06:58,916
<i>What am I getting</i>
<i>all up in my head about?</i>

146
00:06:59,018 --> 00:07:01,111
<i>That research job sounds hard.</i>

147
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:05,384
<i>And I'm pretty.</i>
<i>I'm really, really pretty.</i>

148
00:07:08,494 --> 00:07:11,759
You are looking
at the new coin flip bimbo.

149
00:07:14,167 --> 00:07:15,657
Whoosh!

150
00:07:20,473 --> 00:07:22,464
- You took the <i>Heads or Tails</i> job?
- Yeah.

151
00:07:22,575 --> 00:07:25,135
What about World Wide News?
Your I.D. badge?

152
00:07:25,244 --> 00:07:27,235
You made a New Year's resolution.

153
00:07:27,346 --> 00:07:30,747
Okay, I also said I would never
make out with a garbageman.

154
00:07:30,850 --> 00:07:33,751
Life is what happens when
you're busy making other plans.

155
00:07:33,853 --> 00:07:35,480
What's with the gingerbread house?

156
00:07:35,588 --> 00:07:37,317
We're seeing a Christmas movie.

157
00:07:37,423 --> 00:07:40,017
- It's a Christmas-themed movie snack.
- Mmm.

158
00:07:40,126 --> 00:07:42,356
Let's hope Santa brings you
a girlfriend this year, Teddy.

159
00:07:44,063 --> 00:07:45,587
Where the hell is Barney?

160
00:07:45,698 --> 00:07:48,098
<i>Where was Barney?</i>
<i>Let's back up again.</i>

161
00:07:48,201 --> 00:07:49,793
<i>You see, while this was going on...</i>

162
00:07:49,902 --> 00:07:51,301
- It's positive.
- It's positive?

163
00:07:51,404 --> 00:07:52,530
<i>this was happening.</i>

164
00:07:52,638 --> 00:07:55,436
And now she's totally winning
<i>Celebrity Rehab.</i>

165
00:07:56,375 --> 00:07:57,967
Hey, guys.

166
00:07:58,077 --> 00:08:00,204
A yuletide riddle.

167
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:04,113
What is my second-favorite word
that begins with B-O-N?

168
00:08:04,217 --> 00:08:06,014
Bon Jovi?

169
00:08:06,118 --> 00:08:09,417
What is my third-favorite word
that begins with B-O-N?

170
00:08:09,522 --> 00:08:11,319
"Bonus."

171
00:08:11,424 --> 00:08:15,724
As in my end-of-the-year
bonus check.

172
00:08:15,828 --> 00:08:17,056
My God!

173
00:08:17,163 --> 00:08:19,154
Barney, I work for GNB too.

174
00:08:19,265 --> 00:08:21,995
All I got was a $15 gift card
to Costa Coffee.

175
00:08:22,101 --> 00:08:24,069
And you earned it, buddy.

176
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:26,138
Check out
what I'm gonna buy for myself.

177
00:08:27,406 --> 00:08:29,431
The Dibiase.

178
00:08:29,542 --> 00:08:32,170
See those pinstripes... diamonds.

179
00:08:32,278 --> 00:08:35,475
It is the uppest
a person could ever suit.

180
00:08:35,581 --> 00:08:38,709
Uh, has it ever occurred to you
to give some of this to charity?

181
00:08:38,818 --> 00:08:40,285
Charity?

182
00:08:40,386 --> 00:08:43,378
You're seriously talking to me
about charity, dude? I am Mr. Charity.

183
00:08:43,489 --> 00:08:47,255
I frequently sleep with sixes...

184
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:51,187
chubsters, over-30s.

185
00:08:51,297 --> 00:08:54,357
I am the Bill and Melinda Gates
of the sympathy bang.

186
00:08:56,202 --> 00:08:57,692
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.

187
00:08:57,803 --> 00:09:01,170
- Big announcement.
- Let me guess. You got
a huge bonus check too.

188
00:09:01,274 --> 00:09:03,242
No, just a $30 gift card
to Costa Coffee.

189
00:09:03,342 --> 00:09:05,537
- Thirty?
- I'm pregnant.

190
00:09:05,645 --> 00:09:07,169
What?

191
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:09,748
I've never seen
that woman before in my life.

192
00:09:09,849 --> 00:09:11,680
Sorry. Force of habit.
Congratulations!

193
00:09:12,852 --> 00:09:14,217
<i>Huh.</i>

194
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,083
<i>Marshall and Lily</i>
<i>are doing something meaningful...</i>

195
00:09:16,188 --> 00:09:19,180
<i>and it's making me less</i>
<i>happy about this bonus.</i>

196
00:09:19,292 --> 00:09:22,420
<i>And I'm still single.</i>
<i>At least I got that goin'for me.</i>

197
00:09:22,528 --> 00:09:25,964
<i>So why do I still feel</i>
<i>outside of awesome looking in?</i>

198
00:09:26,065 --> 00:09:28,795
<i>What am I doing with my life?</i>

199
00:09:28,901 --> 00:09:30,801
- We've never been happier.
- Mmm.

200
00:09:30,903 --> 00:09:33,531
Can't imagine anything
bringing me down right now.

201
00:09:33,639 --> 00:09:36,369
Oh, Marshall, you only
think you're happy. Just wait.

202
00:09:36,475 --> 00:09:38,875
Because tonight...

203
00:09:38,978 --> 00:09:41,071
is Barney's favorite things!

204
00:09:49,088 --> 00:09:51,215
<i>That was the reaction Barney expected.</i>

205
00:09:51,324 --> 00:09:53,417
...things!
- <i>This is the one he got.</i>

206
00:09:53,526 --> 00:09:55,619
- Huh?
- I don't know what that is.

207
00:09:55,728 --> 00:09:57,821
Barney's favorite things.

208
00:09:57,930 --> 00:10:00,364
I'm gonna give y'all
a bunch of free stuff.

209
00:10:00,466 --> 00:10:02,229
- Like Oprah.
- Oh.

210
00:10:02,335 --> 00:10:03,597
Just get excited, okay?

211
00:10:03,703 --> 00:10:06,103
Sure.
<i>The next hour got pretty weird.</i>

212
00:10:06,205 --> 00:10:09,003
Velour tracksuits!

213
00:10:09,108 --> 00:10:11,008
- Velour is so comfortable.
- These are so soft!

214
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:14,739
Remote control helicopters!

215
00:10:16,415 --> 00:10:19,213
Condoms!

216
00:10:21,087 --> 00:10:23,521
And last but not least...

217
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:25,591
there is a fleet of limos outside...

218
00:10:25,691 --> 00:10:27,955
waiting to take us to...

219
00:10:28,861 --> 00:10:32,922
a strip club!

220
00:10:33,966 --> 00:10:35,297
<i>You</i> get a lap dance!

221
00:10:35,401 --> 00:10:36,629
<i>You</i> get a lap dance!

222
00:10:36,736 --> 00:10:38,761
You are gonna give <i>me</i>
a lap dance!

223
00:10:38,871 --> 00:10:42,830
Everybody gets a lap dance!

224
00:10:44,043 --> 00:10:47,501
Amazing! It was like
a diamond suit for my soul.

225
00:10:47,613 --> 00:10:49,513
I gotta keep going.
I gotta do more.

226
00:10:49,615 --> 00:10:52,448
No. No. I cannot go
back to that strip club.

227
00:10:52,551 --> 00:10:54,280
I've seen some things.

228
00:10:54,387 --> 00:10:56,287
I'm not going back either.

229
00:10:56,389 --> 00:11:00,450
I'm takin' the rest of my bonus
to God's strip club.

230
00:11:00,559 --> 00:11:03,722
<i>The next day, he paid</i>
<i>a visit to the most charitable man he knew...</i>

231
00:11:03,829 --> 00:11:07,458
<i>his half-brother's father... Sam Gibbs,</i>
<i>a minister at a church out on Long Island.</i>

232
00:11:07,566 --> 00:11:10,194
Sam... Uh, Father.

233
00:11:10,302 --> 00:11:12,202
l-I don't mean
<i>Father</i> Father.

234
00:11:12,304 --> 00:11:14,169
- Unless...
- What's up, Barney?

235
00:11:14,273 --> 00:11:17,731
I'm thinking about giving
some money to charity.

236
00:11:17,843 --> 00:11:20,209
Is that the name of the stripper
you been e-mailing me about?

237
00:11:20,312 --> 00:11:23,281
You gotta take me
off that list, Barney.

238
00:11:23,382 --> 00:11:25,475
No, I don't mean <i>that</i> Charity.

239
00:11:25,584 --> 00:11:27,711
That Charity is doin' Peachy.

240
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:31,017
You'll see pics of the two of 'em
in next week's e-mail. What up!

241
00:11:31,123 --> 00:11:32,784
Barney, I'm a minister.

242
00:11:32,892 --> 00:11:34,917
Unsubscribe.

243
00:11:35,027 --> 00:11:37,325
l... I recently started giving...

244
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:39,125
and it felt surprisingly good.

245
00:11:39,231 --> 00:11:41,665
- I wanna do more.
- Well, now you're talking.

246
00:11:41,767 --> 00:11:45,294
We have this program that helps
those in need get back on their feet.

247
00:11:45,404 --> 00:11:49,704
We give them food, a place to live,
clothes for job interviews.

248
00:11:49,809 --> 00:11:53,802
Well, I would love to help
by writing a check...

249
00:11:53,913 --> 00:11:59,510
for one-zero-zero-zero...

250
00:11:59,618 --> 00:12:01,518
You're not pregnant.

251
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:03,451
zero...

252
00:12:03,556 --> 00:12:05,956
Whoops.
Hold on a second.

253
00:12:08,294 --> 00:12:09,886
<i>Waitl</i>

254
00:12:09,995 --> 00:12:11,656
<i>They're</i> not <i>doing something</i>
<i>meaningful with their lives.</i>

255
00:12:11,764 --> 00:12:13,755
<i>Well, this changes everything.</i>

256
00:12:13,866 --> 00:12:16,664
<i>Oh, no. I've already</i>
<i>written four zeros.</i>

257
00:12:16,769 --> 00:12:20,000
<i>Thank you, decimal point.</i>

258
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:24,407
$100.00.

259
00:12:25,644 --> 00:12:27,168
That's great.

260
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:28,803
Thank you, Barney.

261
00:12:32,785 --> 00:12:35,618
Diamond suited up.

262
00:12:36,689 --> 00:12:38,589
Hey, Ted, can you spot me
for the movie?

263
00:12:38,691 --> 00:12:41,660
I don't like to carry
a lot of cash on me.

264
00:12:45,731 --> 00:12:47,665
What happened
to giving the money away?

265
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:50,668
That was back when Lily was pregnant.
Now she's not.

266
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:53,568
Ergo, a suit is born.

267
00:12:53,672 --> 00:12:56,436
Dude, what's up with the gingerbread house?
You look ridiculous.

268
00:12:56,542 --> 00:12:58,476
It's a Christmas-themed
movie snack.

269
00:12:58,577 --> 00:13:01,102
Oh, I know that move.

270
00:13:01,213 --> 00:13:04,944
You cut a hole in the floor, she reaches
into the living room, finds the tree.

271
00:13:05,050 --> 00:13:07,382
# O holy night #

272
00:13:07,486 --> 00:13:09,078
Nice.

273
00:13:10,089 --> 00:13:11,681
Where the hell are Marshall and Lily?

274
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:13,691
<i>Let's back up one last time.</i>

275
00:13:13,793 --> 00:13:16,353
- I'm pregnant.
- What?

276
00:13:16,462 --> 00:13:18,293
I've never seen
that woman before in my life.

277
00:13:18,397 --> 00:13:21,332
Sorry. Force of habit.
Congratulations!

278
00:13:21,433 --> 00:13:24,095
<i>This is great. I'm happy.</i>

279
00:13:24,203 --> 00:13:26,228
<i>I'm so happy</i>
<i>my heart's pounding.</i>

280
00:13:26,338 --> 00:13:29,102
<i>And I'm sweating.</i>
<i>And I can't breathe.</i>

281
00:13:29,208 --> 00:13:31,335
<i>This is what happiness</i>
<i>feels like, right?</i>

282
00:13:31,443 --> 00:13:34,640
<i>Oh, crap. Lily's having a baby,</i>
<i>and I'm having a panic attack.</i>

283
00:13:34,747 --> 00:13:37,841
<i>I hope she can't tell</i>
<i>what I'm thinking right now.</i>
<i>- I can.</i>

284
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:39,850
<i>And I'm freaking out tool</i>

285
00:13:39,952 --> 00:13:42,978
<i>There's an alien growing in my stomach</i>
<i>that's gonna explode out of my vaginal</i>

286
00:13:43,088 --> 00:13:46,717
<i>- Do you think the others</i>
<i>can tell we're freakin'out?</i>
<i>- What am I doing with my life?</i>

287
00:13:46,826 --> 00:13:48,191
<i>What am I doing with</i> my <i>life?</i>

288
00:13:48,294 --> 00:13:51,525
<i>I should get a Christmas-themed</i>
<i>movie snack for tomorrow night.</i>

289
00:13:51,630 --> 00:13:53,723
<i>They're totally on to us.</i>
<i>What do we do?</i>

290
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:55,323
<i>Just keep smiling.</i>
<i>Maybe wave.</i>

291
00:13:55,434 --> 00:13:57,493
<i>No, don't wavel</i>
<i>That makes no sensel</i>

292
00:13:57,603 --> 00:14:00,197
<i>I'm committed.</i>
<i>I'm riding this wave straight to hell.</i>

293
00:14:00,306 --> 00:14:02,137
<i>Let's leave.</i>
<i>Then the waving will make sense.</i>

294
00:14:02,241 --> 00:14:05,301
See you guys tomorrow.
<i>So Lily and Marshall headed home.</i>

295
00:14:05,411 --> 00:14:07,046
Lily, we have to relax.
There's no need to panic.

296
00:14:07,046 --> 00:14:08,479
Lily, we have to relax.
There's no need to panic.

297
00:14:08,581 --> 00:14:10,811
True, there's a lot to do,
but we've got nine months to prepare.

298
00:14:10,916 --> 00:14:14,682
So I say we make a list of everything that
needs to get done before the baby arrives...

299
00:14:14,787 --> 00:14:16,812
and do everything on that list tonight!

300
00:14:16,922 --> 00:14:18,685
Let's do it!

301
00:14:18,791 --> 00:14:20,122
Uh-huh. Got it.

302
00:14:20,226 --> 00:14:21,591
Okay. That seems easy.

303
00:14:22,294 --> 00:14:23,386
Nursery's painted.

304
00:14:23,495 --> 00:14:26,055
- Blue? What if it's a girl?
- Damn it!

305
00:14:30,803 --> 00:14:32,327
<i># It's the time and the place #</i>

306
00:14:32,438 --> 00:14:35,032
<i># Why all these lights</i>
<i>popping off in my face? #</i>

307
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:37,267
<i># Or am I freakin'out?</i>
<i>Freakin'out? #</i>

308
00:14:37,376 --> 00:14:39,503
<i># Freakin'out? Freakin'out?</i>
<i>Freakin'out? ##</i>

309
00:14:39,612 --> 00:14:42,740
Oh, God, it's 8:00. We're supposed to
meet the gang at the bar to celebrate.

310
00:14:42,848 --> 00:14:45,942
Oh, God. Okay, listen. When we meet them,
we have to keep it together.

311
00:14:46,051 --> 00:14:48,679
- Can you keep it together?
- No, I can't keep it together!

312
00:14:48,787 --> 00:14:51,779
I have never seen you guys
looking so at peace.

313
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:53,950
To Lily and Marshall.

314
00:14:54,059 --> 00:14:56,357
- To Lily and Marshall.
- Well, thank you.

315
00:14:56,462 --> 00:14:59,295
I mean, we've never been happier.

316
00:14:59,398 --> 00:15:02,526
This is a nightmare!
We've done everything wrong!

317
00:15:02,635 --> 00:15:06,230
The iPod was on shuffle!

318
00:15:06,338 --> 00:15:08,272
The Jerky Boys.

319
00:15:08,374 --> 00:15:10,569
Our baby heard The Jerky Boys!

320
00:15:10,676 --> 00:15:14,635
- The Jerky Boys are funny.
- The Jerky Boys aren't funny! They are awful!

321
00:15:14,747 --> 00:15:16,647
Fine. If you don't think
The Jerky Boys are funny...

322
00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:19,274
then I'm not sure that I can
raise a child with you, liver lips!

323
00:15:21,353 --> 00:15:23,719
- Marshall, I don't like this.
- I know.

324
00:15:23,822 --> 00:15:25,585
Okay?
I don't like it either.

325
00:15:25,691 --> 00:15:30,924
It's like I have a hot,
burning ball of stress in my chest...

326
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:33,055
and nothing will make it go away!

327
00:15:33,165 --> 00:15:36,134
- You're not pregnant.
- Well, that did it.

328
00:15:36,235 --> 00:15:39,102
I know this probably comes
as quite a disappointment.

329
00:15:40,739 --> 00:15:42,229
Yeah.

330
00:15:42,341 --> 00:15:43,968
Huge bummer.

331
00:15:44,076 --> 00:15:45,873
So disappointing.

00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:50,613
- <i># Snow on the ground, snow in the... #</i>
- Hey. You guys okay?

333
00:15:50,716 --> 00:15:52,411
Yeah.
Why wouldn't we be?

334
00:15:53,352 --> 00:15:54,478
Oh, the baby thing.

335
00:15:54,586 --> 00:15:55,746
Oh, yeah.
Whatever.

336
00:15:55,854 --> 00:15:57,583
Oh, Christmas-themed
movie snack. Nice.

337
00:15:57,690 --> 00:16:00,659
Don't reach into the living room.

338
00:16:03,062 --> 00:16:05,087
Wow. I thought you guys
would be devastated.

339
00:16:05,197 --> 00:16:08,360
Oh. You know,
we're actually kind of relieved.

340
00:16:08,467 --> 00:16:10,992
We were freakin' out
for about a day and a half there.

341
00:16:11,103 --> 00:16:13,697
Yeah. This whole thing
got us thinking...

342
00:16:13,806 --> 00:16:15,706
maybe we're not ready
for kids yet after all.

343
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:18,606
- We were thinking maybe we'd just get a dog.
- Get a puppy!

344
00:16:18,711 --> 00:16:21,942
Can you imagine?
You could put it in little human shirts...

345
00:16:22,047 --> 00:16:23,639
Whoa!

346
00:16:24,783 --> 00:16:27,616
- Our movie snack.
- Are you kidding me?

347
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:29,950
All you ever talk about is having kids!

348
00:16:30,055 --> 00:16:33,218
And now you have one little freak-out
and you wanna get a dog instead?

349
00:16:33,325 --> 00:16:34,815
No. Unacceptable.

350
00:16:34,927 --> 00:16:37,862
You're gonna turn around,
you're gonna go home, get naked...

351
00:16:37,963 --> 00:16:40,989
lie together as man and wife
until Lily is great with child.

352
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:42,624
Right now!

353
00:16:42,735 --> 00:16:44,930
I'm serious!
Go! Go! Go!

354
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:48,966
Marshall and Lily got in trouble.

355
00:16:49,074 --> 00:16:50,735
- And you!
- Ooh.

356
00:16:50,843 --> 00:16:53,505
Barney, you look real stupid in that suit.

357
00:16:53,612 --> 00:16:55,807
You're gonna go get your money back
and give it to charity.

358
00:16:55,914 --> 00:16:57,814
And I don't mean that stripper
you keep e-mailing us about...

359
00:16:57,916 --> 00:17:00,009
even though we beg you
to take us off that list.

360
00:17:00,119 --> 00:17:02,519
I can't give this suit back.

361
00:17:02,621 --> 00:17:06,022
Ted, I glow in the dark.
I finally glow in the dark.

362
00:17:06,125 --> 00:17:09,151
Criminals of New York, attention!

363
00:17:09,261 --> 00:17:11,661
This man is wearing
a diamond-covered suit!

364
00:17:11,764 --> 00:17:13,823
You can retire on the pants alone!

365
00:17:13,932 --> 00:17:15,957
Merry Christmas!

366
00:17:20,272 --> 00:17:22,672
So, if I get a large popcorn,
you wanna go splitskies, or...

367
00:17:22,775 --> 00:17:24,504
And you.

368
00:17:24,610 --> 00:17:27,204
You did not move to
the greatest city on earth...

369
00:17:27,312 --> 00:17:28,939
to become a coin-flipping bimbo.

370
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:30,640
So here's how it's gonna work.

371
00:17:30,749 --> 00:17:33,047
Heads, you take the job
at World Wide News.

372
00:17:33,152 --> 00:17:35,211
Tails, you take the job
at World Wide News.

373
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:36,719
Ow!

374
00:17:36,822 --> 00:17:38,847
Hey, looks like somebody
got a new gig!

375
00:17:38,957 --> 00:17:41,016
Fine.
I'll call 'em tomorrow.

376
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,694
I'll call 'em right now!

377
00:17:43,796 --> 00:17:45,354
God.

378
00:17:45,464 --> 00:17:47,022
Hello.

379
00:17:47,132 --> 00:17:49,259
- Ted, I can't get married!
- Yes, you can! You love her!

380
00:17:49,368 --> 00:17:52,235
You're right. I do.
Thanks, Ted!

381
00:17:59,411 --> 00:18:01,538
One for
<i>It's a Wonderful Life,</i> please.

382
00:18:01,647 --> 00:18:04,115
<i># Christmastime is here again #</i>

383
00:18:04,216 --> 00:18:05,444

386
00:18:23,068 --> 00:18:25,798
- We're ready for this.
- We're ready for this.

387
00:18:29,007 --> 00:18:30,497
Wow!

388
00:18:30,609 --> 00:18:32,406
That's a lot of zeros.

389
00:18:32,511 --> 00:18:35,810
- You're sure you're not
missing a decimal point?
- Nope.

390
00:18:35,914 --> 00:18:39,509
And that's the tour. Uh, staff meeting's at noon.
You'll meet everyone there.

391
00:18:39,618 --> 00:18:42,644
But first you need
to head down to Security.

392
00:18:42,754 --> 00:18:45,245
You need to get your picture
taken for your I.D. badge.

Positive.

396
00:18:57,369 --> 00:18:59,064
There's more.
Do you still do that thing...

397
00:18:59,171 --> 00:19:01,196
where you give people in need
clothes for job interviews?

398
00:19:01,306 --> 00:19:03,638
- Yeah. Why?
- Bring 'em in, boys.

Congratulations.

407
00:19:30,903 --> 00:19:33,701
You know, that was really cool
what you did.

408
00:19:33,805 --> 00:19:37,263
When we all needed it,
you got us back on the right path.

409
00:19:37,376 --> 00:19:39,037
It's what I do.

410
00:19:39,144 --> 00:19:43,137
Ted, if I, um... if I ever get married...
and you're <i>not</i> the guy I'm marrying...

411
00:19:43,248 --> 00:19:44,647
Big mistake.
But go on.

412

Are you asking
what I think you're asking?

416
00:19:54,826 --> 00:19:57,886
Ted, will you be my best man?

417
00:19:59,398 --> 00:20:01,992
Scherbatsky, I'm gonna crush it.

418
00:20:04,436 --> 00:20:06,336
- Let me look at this.
- Can we not?

419
00:20:06,438 --> 00:20:08,872
How do you even make...
I've never seen you make that face.

420
00:20:12,077 --> 00:20:14,443
Hi there.
We've had a lot of fun tonight.

421
00:20:14,546 --> 00:20:16,446
But on a more serious note...

422
00:20:16,548 --> 00:20:19,449
this is the time of year when we remember
the importance of giving.

423
00:20:19,551 --> 00:20:23,317
And there's no greater gift
than the gift of booty.

424
00:20:23,422 --> 00:20:25,686
So this holiday season...

425
00:20:25,791 --> 00:20:28,191
why not bang someone in need?

426
00:20:28,293 --> 00:20:32,525
I'm Barney Stinson, and that's...
one to grow on.

427
00:20:32,631 --> 00:20:34,622
Um, no.
