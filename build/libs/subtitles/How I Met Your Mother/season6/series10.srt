1
00:00:01,067 --> 00:00:03,934
<i>Kids, in the fall of 2010...</i>

2
00:00:04,037 --> 00:00:05,732
<i>I was hosting my very first Thanksgiving...</i>

3
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:07,534
<i>and I wanted it to be unforgettable.</i>

4
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:11,007
Instead of stuffing,
I'm gonna fill the turkey with...

5
00:00:11,111 --> 00:00:12,703
a slightly smaller turkey.

6
00:00:12,812 --> 00:00:15,144
It's called a "turturkeykey."

7
00:00:15,248 --> 00:00:17,182
- A turturkeykey?
- Mm-hmm.

8
00:00:17,283 --> 00:00:19,012
Uh-uh-oh-oh.

9
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:21,451
Yeah, I was there for the insertion.

10
00:00:21,554 --> 00:00:24,318
He used shoehorns. I'll be having sides.

11
00:00:25,091 --> 00:00:26,524
Your loss.

12
00:00:26,626 --> 00:00:28,685
It's dead in here.
I'm gonna call it a little early.

13
00:00:28,795 --> 00:00:32,196
What? No, you can't go now.
It's the night before Thanksgiving.

14
00:00:32,298 --> 00:00:34,198
College chicks are back in town.

15
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:36,598
Their moms just made a snide comment
about the weight they gained.

16
00:00:36,703 --> 00:00:38,933
They called her a "bitch,"
but deep down they know she's right.

17
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:42,008
And they are about to walk through that door
where we will be waiting...

18
00:00:42,108 --> 00:00:45,271
with some light beer
and some rock-hard approval.

19
00:00:45,378 --> 00:00:47,073
Wh-What u-up?

20
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:50,672
You don't wanna bail early, man.
You could become the Blitz.

21
00:00:50,784 --> 00:00:52,012
Ooh!

22
00:00:52,118 --> 00:00:54,018
<i>Blitz was a guy we knew in college.</i>

23
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:55,849
<i>Sadly, he was cursed.</i>

24
00:00:55,955 --> 00:00:58,355
Well, I'm calling it a little early.

25
00:00:58,458 --> 00:01:00,619
Wha... You sure? We got big plans.

26
00:01:00,727 --> 00:01:02,820
Remember how last week
we fired up a sandwich...

27
00:01:02,929 --> 00:01:05,955
and we listened to Pink Floyd's <i>Dark Side of</i>
<i>the Moon</i> while watching <i>The Wizard of Oz?</i>

28
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:08,432
Well, tonight, we're doing the same thing...

29
00:01:08,535 --> 00:01:11,163
only with Weird Al Yankovic's
<i>Greatest Hits...</i>

30
00:01:11,271 --> 00:01:12,898
and <i>Apocalypse Now.</i>

31
00:01:13,006 --> 00:01:14,735
We'll see what happens.

32
00:01:14,841 --> 00:01:18,106
Nah. It's Kraft-Croft night...
mac and cheese and <i>Tomb Raider.</i>

33
00:01:18,211 --> 00:01:19,735
Bizzow!

34
00:01:19,846 --> 00:01:22,076
<i>You see, every time Blitz left a place...</i>

35
00:01:22,182 --> 00:01:24,150
<i>something amazing happened.</i>

36
00:01:27,387 --> 00:01:30,117
Oh. I'm sorry. I thought this was my room.

37
00:01:32,826 --> 00:01:35,886
- Completely naked!
- Completely naked!

38
00:01:35,995 --> 00:01:37,394
Aw, man!

39
00:01:37,497 --> 00:01:40,625
- And the movie was awesome.
- Aw, man!

40
00:01:40,733 --> 00:01:42,724
At the exact moment Brando first appeared...

41
00:01:42,836 --> 00:01:44,895
Weird Al launched right into "Eat It."

42
00:01:45,004 --> 00:01:47,165
Aw, man!

43
00:01:47,273 --> 00:01:50,800
<i>And over the years,</i>
<i>the curse of the Blitz continued.</i>

44
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:52,741
Well, I'm gonna call it.

45
00:01:52,846 --> 00:01:55,508
I just got Madden 2K1,
and I can't stop thinking about it.

46
00:01:55,615 --> 00:01:58,482
- See you later.
- Bye-bye.
- See you later.

47
00:02:03,356 --> 00:02:06,257
Taps broke.
Can't turn 'em off. Free beer for everyone.

48
00:02:06,359 --> 00:02:07,951
Yeah!

49
00:02:08,695 --> 00:02:10,253
Free beer for everyone!

50
00:02:10,363 --> 00:02:15,027
- Free beer for everyone.
- Aw, man!

51
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:16,500
You know what?

52
00:02:16,603 --> 00:02:18,571
Ted, go ahead.
Leave early to do something lame.

53
00:02:18,671 --> 00:02:21,606
Just don't blame us if you become the Blitz.

54
00:02:21,708 --> 00:02:25,644
First of all, there's nothing lame
about brining a turturkeykey...

55
00:02:25,745 --> 00:02:27,212
copyright pending.

56
00:02:27,313 --> 00:02:30,578
And secondly,
I don't believe the curse of the Blitz is real.

57
00:02:30,683 --> 00:02:33,447
<i>Kids, I'd live to regret those words.</i>

58
00:02:33,553 --> 00:02:37,512
<i>The curse of the Blitz could be passed</i>
<i>from one person to the next at any moment.</i>

59
00:02:37,624 --> 00:02:40,787
<i>Blitz had gotten the curse</i>
<i>from Jerry Windheim back in freshman year...</i>

60
00:02:40,894 --> 00:02:43,454
<i>who got it years before that</i>
<i>from Davey Beaterman.</i>

61
00:02:43,563 --> 00:02:47,431
<i>The original Blitz, Matt Blitz, was a guy</i>
<i>who went to Wesleyan back in the '60s.</i>

62
00:02:47,534 --> 00:02:50,059
<i>He dropped out</i>
<i>right before the school went coed.</i>

63
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:52,661
<i>And then, Thanksgiving morning...</i>

64
00:02:56,910 --> 00:02:59,208
What the hell happened here?

65
00:02:59,312 --> 00:03:01,246
Hey! Morning, Blitz.

66
00:03:01,347 --> 00:03:03,247
Aw, man!

67
00:03:03,349 --> 00:03:06,409
No, no. Let's get one thing straight, okay?
I am not the Blitz.

68
00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:10,649
# My Blitzy lies over the ocean #

69
00:03:10,757 --> 00:03:14,659
# My Blitzy lies over the sea #

70
00:03:14,761 --> 00:03:18,390
# My Blitzy lies over the ocean #

71
00:03:18,498 --> 00:03:21,194
- # So bring back my Blitzy... #
- Please stop.

72
00:03:23,203 --> 00:03:24,500
Okay, fine.

73
00:03:24,604 --> 00:03:26,663
# To me ##

74
00:03:26,773 --> 00:03:28,331
The Gentleman.

75
00:03:28,441 --> 00:03:29,874
The Gentleman!

76
00:03:29,976 --> 00:03:32,171
Wait, wait.
What's that? What's the Gentleman?

77
00:03:32,278 --> 00:03:35,179
- Oh, you had to be there, Blitz.
- I'm not the Blitz.

78
00:03:46,459 --> 00:03:49,553
- Zoey?
- Morning, Blitz.

79
00:04:04,911 --> 00:04:06,811
<i>Kids, you remember Zoey.</i>

80
00:04:06,913 --> 00:04:09,245
<i>For the last two months,</i>
<i>she'd been making my life hell.</i>

81
00:04:10,717 --> 00:04:13,550
Thanks, guys. Last night was amazing.

82
00:04:13,653 --> 00:04:16,554
- The Gentleman!
- The Gentle...

83
00:04:18,524 --> 00:04:21,755
How could you,
my best friends in the world...

84
00:04:21,861 --> 00:04:23,761
hang out with my mortal enemy...

85
00:04:23,863 --> 00:04:27,890
and let her sleep in the tub
where I clean myself?

86
00:04:28,001 --> 00:04:30,231
Sorry, Ted. We can explain.

87
00:04:30,336 --> 00:04:31,963
After you Blitzed out last night...

88
00:04:32,071 --> 00:04:33,231
I'm not the Blitz!

89
00:04:33,339 --> 00:04:35,933
Oh, my God. That's Zoey.

90
00:04:36,042 --> 00:04:37,634
That's Ted's enemy.

91
00:04:37,744 --> 00:04:40,474
Which means she's our enemy.

92
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:42,980
Let's take this bitch down.

93
00:04:43,082 --> 00:04:46,984
Huh? Huh? Who's got your back?
Now let's have dinner.

94
00:04:47,086 --> 00:04:49,350
Finish the story, Red.

95
00:04:49,455 --> 00:04:53,619
We all started brainstorming ways
to mess with her.

96
00:04:53,726 --> 00:04:56,251
There were a lot of different ideas
kicking around.

97
00:04:56,362 --> 00:04:58,523
And then I'm just gonna leave her there...

98
00:04:58,631 --> 00:05:01,259
buck naked, covered in candle wax...

99
00:05:01,367 --> 00:05:03,631
tied to the bed.

100
00:05:03,736 --> 00:05:06,830
Barney, I know that Ted
doesn't like that girl...

101
00:05:06,939 --> 00:05:09,305
but that's a little extreme.

102
00:05:09,409 --> 00:05:12,207
Wait. Ted doesn't like that girl?

103
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:15,679
Okay, no, I got it. You see that silk scarf?

104
00:05:15,782 --> 00:05:17,613
I'm gonna steal it.

105
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:24,623
Can I help you?

106
00:05:25,558 --> 00:05:27,719
Yeah. Yeah.

107
00:05:27,827 --> 00:05:30,193
My name is Lily Aldrin.

108
00:05:30,296 --> 00:05:32,662
I'm a friend of Ted Mosby, so you better...

109
00:05:32,765 --> 00:05:34,960
You're Lily Aldrin? The painter?

110
00:05:35,068 --> 00:05:37,298
Well, yeah.

111
00:05:37,403 --> 00:05:40,668
You're amazing.
I bought a bunch of your paintings online.

112
00:05:40,773 --> 00:05:43,071
- That was you?
- Yeah.

113
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:44,871
Oh!

114
00:05:44,977 --> 00:05:46,968
None of us meant for it to happen.

115
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:50,811
- But... Well, we had
an awesome night with her.
- Mmm.

116
00:05:52,552 --> 00:05:54,452
The Gentleman!

117
00:05:56,322 --> 00:05:59,485
And then the craziest thing happened.

118
00:06:04,097 --> 00:06:05,530
I missed a skateboarding dog?

119
00:06:05,631 --> 00:06:08,998
- Yeah, but that wasn't the crazy part.
- It wasn't?

120
00:06:09,102 --> 00:06:12,230
Okay, Marshall, truth or dare.

121
00:06:12,338 --> 00:06:16,741
Awesome. Well, Lily doesn't
let me do truths. So dare.

122
00:06:16,843 --> 00:06:18,367
Okay.

123
00:06:18,478 --> 00:06:21,777
I dare you to send a picture of your junk...

124
00:06:21,881 --> 00:06:23,576
to a complete stranger.

125
00:06:23,683 --> 00:06:25,844
Ooh!

126
00:06:26,652 --> 00:06:28,517
Best idea ever!

127
00:06:28,621 --> 00:06:30,646
Worst idea ever.

128
00:06:30,757 --> 00:06:32,748
My junk ended up in some stranger's pocket.

129
00:06:32,859 --> 00:06:36,295
If their phone was on vibrate,
I basically dry-humped them.

130
00:06:36,396 --> 00:06:38,921
Whoa.

131
00:06:39,031 --> 00:06:41,864
Okay.
Everybody shout out random numbers.

132
00:06:41,968 --> 00:06:43,299
- Um...
- Uh...

133
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:45,371
Four, eight, 15, 16, 23, 42.

134
00:06:45,471 --> 00:06:47,564
And... send!

135
00:06:49,142 --> 00:06:50,575
Wait. Blitz was there too?

136
00:06:50,676 --> 00:06:51,870
The Gentleman!

137
00:06:51,978 --> 00:06:53,878
The Gentleman!

138
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:55,641
Oh, I was there for the whole thing.

139
00:06:55,748 --> 00:06:59,548
Something inside me just said,
"Grand Theft Auto can wait a night."

140
00:06:59,652 --> 00:07:01,517
It was legen...

141
00:07:01,621 --> 00:07:03,282
Wait for Ted to leave
'cause he's now the Blitz.

142
00:07:03,389 --> 00:07:04,356
...dary.

143
00:07:04,457 --> 00:07:05,583
Legendary.

144
00:07:05,691 --> 00:07:06,959
- I'm not the Blitz.
- I'm afraid you are, Ted.

145
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:08,153
- I'm not the Blitz.
- I'm afraid you are, Ted.

146
00:07:08,261 --> 00:07:10,229
You see, when you left last night...

147
00:07:10,329 --> 00:07:14,595
you changed the course of Blitz-ory.

148
00:07:18,137 --> 00:07:19,934
<i>Blitzl</i>

149
00:07:35,755 --> 00:07:37,154
I'm finally free.

150
00:07:37,256 --> 00:07:40,157
You have no idea
what I've missed all these years...

151
00:07:40,259 --> 00:07:44,628
the university president's toupee
being snatched by a hawk at graduation...

152
00:07:44,730 --> 00:07:46,823
Zeppelin reuniting
at my cousin Ira's bar mitzvah...

153
00:07:46,933 --> 00:07:49,959
countless nip-slips, crotch shots...

154
00:07:50,069 --> 00:07:51,764
shooting stars and double rainbows.

155
00:07:51,871 --> 00:07:53,338
I've missed them all.

156
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:57,272
- Not anymore, Blitz.
- My name's not Blitz.

157
00:07:58,077 --> 00:08:01,478
My name is Steve!

158
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:04,973
Colors seem so bright now.

159
00:08:08,754 --> 00:08:10,654
- Thank you, Blitz.
- What?

160
00:08:10,756 --> 00:08:12,986
No. No, no. No, no, no. I'm not the Blitz.

161
00:08:13,092 --> 00:08:14,719
The only thing I missed last night...

162
00:08:14,827 --> 00:08:17,990
was my best friends stabbing me in the back
by hanging out with my worst enemy.

163
00:08:18,097 --> 00:08:20,691
Guys, I hate Zoey.

164
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:24,133
That means you're supposed to hate her too.
That's your rule, Lily.

165
00:08:24,237 --> 00:08:26,467
- I tried.
- Tried?

166
00:08:26,572 --> 00:08:30,872
Lily, do you have any idea
how many people I blindly hated for you?

167
00:08:30,977 --> 00:08:35,846
I hated Ren?e Zellweger
with a burning passion for eight years...

168
00:08:35,948 --> 00:08:37,973
only to discover you meant Reese Witherspoon.

169
00:08:38,084 --> 00:08:42,350
Hey, I will hate her until I get
my money back for <i>You, Me and Dupree.</i>

170
00:08:42,455 --> 00:08:43,922
That's Kate Hudson!

171
00:08:44,023 --> 00:08:47,390
Oh, yeah. That's who I hate.
Guys, we hate Kate Hudson.

172
00:08:47,493 --> 00:08:49,723
No! We hate Zoey!

173
00:08:49,829 --> 00:08:52,093
I'm so furious at you all right now.

174
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:55,565
But it's Thanksgiving,
and I have a turturkeykey to make.

175
00:08:56,869 --> 00:08:59,167
And not that I'm the Blitz...

176
00:08:59,272 --> 00:09:01,832
but could everyone please come
with me into the kitchen?

177
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:04,210
Okay, I'm, uh,
just gonna preheat the oven.

178
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:07,839
Okay, I'm, uh,
just gonna preheat the oven.

179
00:09:07,947 --> 00:09:09,676
The oven.

180
00:09:09,782 --> 00:09:12,910
Hey, Robin, you should dance on the oven.

181
00:09:13,019 --> 00:09:14,748
- Oh!
- Oh!
- Yeah!

182
00:09:14,854 --> 00:09:16,913
- Dance on the oven!
- Make out with Zoey!

183
00:09:17,023 --> 00:09:19,958
- Dance on the oven!
- Make out with Zoey!

184
00:09:26,799 --> 00:09:29,199
Did they tell you
about the skateboarding dog?

185
00:09:30,703 --> 00:09:32,193
It was awesome.

186
00:09:38,177 --> 00:09:40,338
Great. So not only did you guys betray me...

187
00:09:40,446 --> 00:09:42,744
but you broke my oven on Thanksgiving?

188
00:09:42,848 --> 00:09:46,181
Full disclosure. We also used
all your butter greasing up Lily...

189
00:09:46,285 --> 00:09:48,583
so we could see how far
we could slide her down the hall.

190
00:09:48,688 --> 00:09:51,987
But if it helps, I reached 4G.

191
00:09:52,091 --> 00:09:54,889
It doesn't help. 4G?

192
00:09:54,994 --> 00:09:55,892
Mm-hmm.

193
00:09:55,995 --> 00:09:58,725
No. Wh-What are we supposed to do now?

194
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,735
This is awesome. I'm part of this.

195
00:10:04,904 --> 00:10:07,839
Barney, I don't know
if the oven's deep enough.

196
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:12,240
Plus, it's a display made of cardboard.

197
00:10:12,345 --> 00:10:14,575
Oh. I should probably disconnect the gas.

198
00:10:16,048 --> 00:10:18,881
Hey, just so you guys know,
there was a tiny explosion...

199
00:10:18,985 --> 00:10:21,510
at the sewage treatment plant
across the street from our apartment.

200
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:23,919
But I'm sure it's fine by now.

201
00:10:24,023 --> 00:10:26,651
- This is awesome.
- It's not awesome.

202
00:10:26,759 --> 00:10:28,920
I think the smaller turkey...

203
00:10:29,028 --> 00:10:32,589
just tried to crawl further
inside the bigger turkey.

204
00:10:34,233 --> 00:10:35,928
Um...

205
00:10:37,269 --> 00:10:40,932
Um, I'm having...
I'm having trouble breathing.

206
00:10:43,042 --> 00:10:45,135
Mom keeps an extra litter box in here.

207
00:10:46,979 --> 00:10:49,447
There you go. Good as new.

208
00:10:50,616 --> 00:10:52,584
Oh. Hey, Ginger.

209
00:10:55,221 --> 00:10:58,713
Ted, you're not gonna like this,
but we do have one other option.

210
00:11:00,059 --> 00:11:03,517
Hey, you guys should come
to my house for Thanksgiving.

211
00:11:03,629 --> 00:11:07,565
My husband always spends it with his
daughter, so I'm gonna be alone anyway.

212
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:09,032
Could we bring Ted?

213
00:11:10,269 --> 00:11:11,827
It's Thanksgiving.

214
00:11:11,937 --> 00:11:14,201
- What the hell?
- Yeah!

215
00:11:17,309 --> 00:11:19,209
No. Absolutely not.

216
00:11:19,311 --> 00:11:21,006
Come on. Give her a chance.

217
00:11:21,113 --> 00:11:24,571
Ted, you violated a dead turkey
with another dead turkey.

218
00:11:24,684 --> 00:11:26,311
Don't let that be in vain.

219
00:11:26,419 --> 00:11:28,319
You guys, wait a minute.

220
00:11:28,421 --> 00:11:29,820
Where's Barney?

221
00:11:29,922 --> 00:11:34,154
And here's the twist, Babaka.

222
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:38,754
Because Ted left early, he's now the Blitz.

223
00:11:38,864 --> 00:11:40,991
But, Barney, now you left the group.

224
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:43,830
Wouldn't that put you in danger
of becoming the Blitz yourself?

225
00:11:43,936 --> 00:11:46,769
No. I ca... Because...

226
00:11:47,807 --> 00:11:49,832
Step on it.

227
00:11:51,277 --> 00:11:53,177
Hey, hey, hey! You missed it!

228
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:55,679
- Oh, my goodness!
- Our cab took a wrong turn.

229
00:11:55,781 --> 00:11:57,408
We were in the Thanksgiving Day Parade.

230
00:11:57,516 --> 00:12:00,610
Tony Bennett passed Ted the mike,
and he sang "Twist and Shout."

231
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,210
But he's the Blitz.

232
00:12:02,321 --> 00:12:04,915
No. I'm not the Blitz.

233
00:12:05,024 --> 00:12:06,548
I'm the Bueller.

234
00:12:06,659 --> 00:12:08,854
You know what this means?

235
00:12:08,961 --> 00:12:10,394
<i>You're</i> the Blitz.

236
00:12:11,297 --> 00:12:14,095
<i>Blitzl</i>

237
00:12:15,601 --> 00:12:19,970
- Oh, God, no.
- Life moves pretty fast, Barney.

238
00:12:20,072 --> 00:12:23,200
If you don't stop and look around
once in a while, you might miss it.

239
00:12:24,009 --> 00:12:25,533
Chicka-chicka.

240
00:12:28,347 --> 00:12:30,110
Happy Thanksgiving.

241
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:32,578
Ted.

242
00:12:32,685 --> 00:12:33,947
Zoey.

243
00:12:36,422 --> 00:12:38,117
Best friend alert.

244
00:12:40,693 --> 00:12:43,958
Okay, the turturkeykey is officially cooking.

245
00:12:44,063 --> 00:12:46,224
Oh. Oh, God, that is disgusting!

246
00:12:46,332 --> 00:12:48,129
Guys, that's starting to hurt.

247
00:12:48,234 --> 00:12:50,361
No, no. No, Ted.

248
00:12:50,469 --> 00:12:53,529
"Random number" guy
just sent me his wang back.

249
00:12:53,639 --> 00:12:55,266
Wow!

250
00:12:55,374 --> 00:12:57,899
You sent a wang out, and you got a wang back.

251
00:12:58,010 --> 00:12:59,739
- It's a "boomewang."
- Nice.

252
00:12:59,845 --> 00:13:02,177
- Thank you.
- No, I meant the wang.

253
00:13:02,281 --> 00:13:05,478
- Barney, could you get me some more ice?
- Sure.

254
00:13:05,584 --> 00:13:08,075
But no one move while I'm gone.

255
00:13:08,187 --> 00:13:09,586
I'm scared.

256
00:13:09,688 --> 00:13:11,883
You're safe. It's okay to leave the room.

257
00:13:11,991 --> 00:13:14,653
You have to actually leave the building
for something cool to happen.

258
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:15,954
Thanks.

259
00:13:16,061 --> 00:13:19,394
You're the only one
who's nice to me about this.

260
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:23,325
Okay, I gotta test this.

261
00:13:29,441 --> 00:13:31,306
What happened?

262
00:13:31,410 --> 00:13:34,607
- You missed it.
- Dude, you walked out of the room...

263
00:13:34,713 --> 00:13:38,012
the laws of physics stopped,
and the laws of awesome tripled.

264
00:13:38,117 --> 00:13:41,712
Aw, man. You said I could leave the room.

265
00:13:41,821 --> 00:13:44,381
I just wanted to see something cool happen.

266
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:47,891
I'm sorry. But I was on that island
for what seems like eternity.

267
00:13:47,993 --> 00:13:49,961
I'm gonna enjoy things on the other side.

268
00:13:50,062 --> 00:13:52,257
No! You...

269
00:13:52,364 --> 00:13:55,128
Robin. Robin, I will pay you to be the Blitz.

270
00:13:55,234 --> 00:13:58,692
A hundred dollars. No. $10,000.

271
00:13:58,804 --> 00:14:01,637
No. Sixty bucks.
What's a lot of money for someone like you?

272
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:04,607
Dude, the Blitz isn't something
that can be bought or sold.

273
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:08,009
- Yeah, it's not like Ted's integrity.
- Oh, what was that?

274
00:14:08,113 --> 00:14:11,480
I was distracted by the four-carat diamond
your 53-year-old husband bought you.

275
00:14:11,584 --> 00:14:15,816
- Facial.
- If you'll excuse me,
I have a turturkeykey to baste.

276
00:14:15,921 --> 00:14:18,651
- I'm coming with you.
- No. I baste alone.

277
00:14:18,757 --> 00:14:20,850
Oh, I'm sure you're a master baster, Ted.

278
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:22,825
Wordplay. Lovin' it.

279
00:14:22,928 --> 00:14:26,329
But relax. I've got a ton of sides to heat up
since my plans fell through.

280
00:14:26,432 --> 00:14:27,990
Who canceled... your coven?

281
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:30,432
Coven. Group of witches. Boom.

282
00:14:30,536 --> 00:14:33,061
Yeah. They were worn out
from putting that spell on your hair.

283
00:14:33,172 --> 00:14:34,662
Oh! Serve returned.

284
00:14:34,773 --> 00:14:37,264
Are you happy? You're ruining Thanksgiving.

285
00:14:37,376 --> 00:14:40,277
Well, you're not exactly who I thought
I'd be spending Thanksgiving with either.

286
00:14:41,647 --> 00:14:43,615
God, I'm so happy to be here.

287
00:14:43,716 --> 00:14:46,617
- My face hurts from smiling.
- Oh!

288
00:14:46,719 --> 00:14:49,187
Sorry, Lily. I'm just never
gonna like that woman.

289
00:14:49,288 --> 00:14:51,950
- Ted, give her a chance.
- Enemies can't become friends.

290
00:14:52,057 --> 00:14:54,287
Yes, they can. Right, guys?

291
00:14:54,393 --> 00:14:56,293
- Oh. Absolutely.
- Yes. Yes.
- No.

292
00:14:56,395 --> 00:14:59,023
You guys can't be objective.
You still feel guilty about last night.

293
00:14:59,131 --> 00:15:01,190
- Well, let's get an outside opinion.
- Who are we gonna...

294
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:02,892
- Dear Wang Guy...
- Oh.

295
00:15:03,002 --> 00:15:05,800
can enemies ever be friends?

296
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:07,372
- Just wondering.
- Hmm.

297
00:15:07,473 --> 00:15:11,569
Really? Wang Guy. We're asking Wang Guy?

298
00:15:11,677 --> 00:15:14,339
He's bold and uninhibited.
So why not?

299
00:15:14,446 --> 00:15:16,414
Hey, guys, you know what? For fun...

300
00:15:16,515 --> 00:15:19,541
why don't we ask him
what he does for a living.

301
00:15:19,652 --> 00:15:21,916
Wouldn't that be fun? Just...

302
00:15:22,021 --> 00:15:25,787
Aw, you've got a little crush
on Wang Guy, don't you?

303
00:15:25,891 --> 00:15:29,224
What? No. Shut up. I hate him.

304
00:15:29,328 --> 00:15:32,388
Oh. We got an answer. Here it is.

305
00:15:32,498 --> 00:15:35,399
"Yes. Enemies can become friends.

306
00:15:35,501 --> 00:15:40,905
Remember what Gandhi said.
'Be the change you want to see in the world."'

307
00:15:41,006 --> 00:15:43,566
Uh, did Wang Guy just quote Gandhi?

308
00:15:43,676 --> 00:15:46,645
That is amazing. And I was here for it.

309
00:15:46,745 --> 00:15:49,839
Now Zoey is the Blitz. Ha! Ha!

310
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:52,110
Burn on her.

311
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:56,454
Come on, man. Don't be that Blitz.

312
00:15:56,555 --> 00:15:59,319
I'm not any Blitz. You're the Blitz.

313
00:15:59,425 --> 00:16:01,017
You're all the Blitz.

314
00:16:01,126 --> 00:16:04,027
I slept with that cute Indian girl
who cuts my hair.

315
00:16:04,129 --> 00:16:05,858
What does that have to do with anything?

316
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:09,128
Nothing. I just forgot to brag about it before.

317
00:16:09,234 --> 00:16:12,328
Guys, despite the wit and wisdom
of Wang Guy...

318
00:16:12,438 --> 00:16:14,531
Zoey and I are never gonna be friends.

319
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:17,507
We're just here for her oven, and that's it.

320
00:16:17,609 --> 00:16:20,134
Oh, my God!

321
00:16:20,245 --> 00:16:23,112
- Did you do that on purpose?
- No. It was an accident.

322
00:16:23,215 --> 00:16:26,048
- Oh, yeah, well, like this is.
- Oh. Great. Real mature.

323
00:16:26,151 --> 00:16:28,551
Yeah, well, you started it.

324
00:16:28,654 --> 00:16:30,918
Stop it!

325
00:16:31,023 --> 00:16:34,117
Can't you two just stop fighting for one day?

326
00:16:34,226 --> 00:16:39,220
Like when the roadrunner and the coyote
clocked out and had a beer together.

327
00:16:39,331 --> 00:16:42,300
Or-Or-Or Tom and Jerry
shared a cup of coffee.

328
00:16:42,401 --> 00:16:44,301
Lily, those are cartoon characters...

329
00:16:44,403 --> 00:16:46,633
and I'm pretty sure
you're making up episodes.

330
00:16:46,739 --> 00:16:50,903
And if Zoey is a cartoon character,
she's Cinderella's evil stepmother!

331
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:54,241
Get out. All of you, out!

332
00:16:54,346 --> 00:16:55,836
But it's Thanksgiving.

333
00:16:55,948 --> 00:16:57,711
And I'm a part of it.

334
00:16:57,816 --> 00:16:58,976
Out!

335
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:04,518
Wait. Where's Barney?

336
00:17:04,623 --> 00:17:08,582
Hey, guys, the most amazing thing
just happened to me in that other roo...

337
00:17:10,429 --> 00:17:12,420
Aw, man!

338
00:17:17,569 --> 00:17:21,164
I don't get it.
Why'd she just kick us out like that?

339
00:17:21,273 --> 00:17:24,936
<i>Then the cabdriver said</i>
<i>the last thing any of us wanted to hear.</i>

340
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:26,568
Where to?

341
00:17:28,347 --> 00:17:31,009
I guess we're going home.

342
00:17:33,619 --> 00:17:35,849
Yeah, I don't know where that is.

343
00:17:47,633 --> 00:17:49,225
Lily, where'd you get that?

344
00:17:49,334 --> 00:17:54,533
Oh. When Zoey booted us, it made me
wanna steal something of hers again.

345
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:58,701
Apartment full of designer labels,
and what do I grab?

346
00:17:58,811 --> 00:18:01,939
"Happy Turkey Day, Hannah. Love, Zoey."

347
00:18:02,681 --> 00:18:04,410
I wonder who Hannah is.

348
00:18:07,853 --> 00:18:10,913
Hey, you guys should come
to my house for Thanksgiving.

349
00:18:11,023 --> 00:18:14,789
My husband always spends it with his
daughter, so I'm gonna be alone anyway.

350
00:18:14,893 --> 00:18:17,885
Well, you're not exactly who I thought
I'd be spending Thanksgiving with either.

351
00:18:17,996 --> 00:18:21,989
And if Zoey is a cartoon character,
she's Cinderella's evil stepmother!

352
00:18:22,901 --> 00:18:25,335
Get out. All of you, out!

353
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:29,808
We have to go back to Zoey's.

354
00:18:32,010 --> 00:18:34,604
You gotta throw me some addresses, buddy.

355
00:18:37,049 --> 00:18:39,074
Oh, God!

356
00:18:39,184 --> 00:18:43,621
- What are you doing here?
- Barney let us in.

357
00:18:43,722 --> 00:18:45,952
Barney was here?
I was walking around half naked.

358
00:18:46,058 --> 00:18:49,960
Aw, man! Wait. Which half?

359
00:18:50,062 --> 00:18:53,964
Look, I'm sorry your stepdaughter didn't
want to spend Thanksgiving with you.

360
00:18:54,066 --> 00:18:56,830
- How do you know that?
- I just do.

361
00:18:56,935 --> 00:18:58,527
Must be tough.

362
00:18:58,637 --> 00:19:02,198
It was the first Thanksgiving
Hannah agreed to spend with me...

363
00:19:02,307 --> 00:19:05,936
and then, at the last minute,
she... changed her mind.

364
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:08,943
She hates my guts.

365
00:19:10,449 --> 00:19:12,610
I get that.

366
00:19:13,652 --> 00:19:15,847
Uh, you should hang on to this.

367
00:19:15,954 --> 00:19:17,922
You can give it to her next year.

368
00:19:18,957 --> 00:19:21,653
Yeah. Right.

369
00:19:22,294 --> 00:19:23,625
Next year.

370
00:19:23,729 --> 00:19:26,823
Hey, you never know.
People don't stay enemies forever.

371
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:31,298
<i>And that's the story</i>
<i>of how Zoey and I became friends.</i>

372
00:19:31,403 --> 00:19:33,803
- Cheers.
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

373
00:19:33,906 --> 00:19:37,637
Before we eat, we should take
a group picture and send it to Wang Guy.

374
00:19:37,743 --> 00:19:39,540
Oh, great idea.

375
00:19:41,313 --> 00:19:42,871
Okay, here we go.

376
00:19:42,981 --> 00:19:45,973
One, two, three.

377
00:19:46,084 --> 00:19:51,078
Ted, that is the best-Iooking turturkeykey
I have ever seen.

378
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:54,921
- Yeah.
- Thank you.
I just hope it tastes as good as it looks.

379
00:19:55,027 --> 00:19:58,360
<i>It didn't. It tasted wrong.</i>

380
00:19:58,463 --> 00:20:01,023
- Oops. Forgot to light the candles.
- Oh, yeah.

381
00:20:02,267 --> 00:20:03,996
<i>And just as Barney looked away...</i>

382
00:20:04,102 --> 00:20:05,569
<i>it happened.</i>

383
00:20:34,633 --> 00:20:36,225
The Gentleman!

384
00:20:36,335 --> 00:20:39,429
What happened? I saw it.

385
00:20:39,538 --> 00:20:42,234
Aw, come on, Blitz. Now it's just sad.

386
00:20:42,341 --> 00:20:43,933
Aw, man!

387
00:20:49,615 --> 00:20:51,708
Oh, go ahead. I forgot my jacket.

388
00:20:53,652 --> 00:20:55,620
Oh, hold the door.

389
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:02,124
Thank you, God!

390
00:21:02,227 --> 00:21:05,094
Aw, man!

391
00:21:05,197 --> 00:21:07,927
