<i>NARRATOR:
In the fall of 2009, a new
couple had moved in upstairs.</i>

2
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:04,867
<i>We hadn't met them yet,</i>

3
00:00:04,867 --> 00:00:07,434
<i>but we could hear them,
all the time.</i>

4
00:00:07,434 --> 00:00:08,734
<i>They were always...</i>

5
00:00:08,734 --> 00:00:10,533
<i>Well, kids, let's just say
they were always</i>

6
00:00:10,533 --> 00:00:12,134
<i>"playing the bagpipes."</i>

7
00:00:17,533 --> 00:00:19,600
Okay, this is ridiculous.

8
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:21,700
I can't believe those
two are still bagpiping.

9
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:24,134
I know. It's been six hours.

10
00:00:24,134 --> 00:00:26,800
Must be that tantric bagpiping
that Sting is into.

11
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:29,633
She keeps yelling out for him
to play the bagpipes harder,

12
00:00:29,633 --> 00:00:31,934
but it sounds like he's
bagpiping her pretty hard.

13
00:00:31,934 --> 00:00:33,533
There's a glass of water
in my bedroom

14
00:00:33,533 --> 00:00:35,468
<i>that's vibrating
like Jurassic Park.</i>

15
00:00:36,667 --> 00:00:38,934
You have neighbors!

16
00:00:38,934 --> 00:00:41,134
Shut the bagpipes up!

00:00:56,968 --> 00:00:58,834
<i>That didn't work out so well.</i>

20
00:00:58,834 --> 00:00:59,868
Ted, I hate to have

21
00:00:59,868 --> 00:01:02,701
to be the one
to tell you this.

22
00:01:02,701 --> 00:01:04,567
Marshall and Lily
are getting a divorce.

23
00:01:04,567 --> 00:01:07,167
No, they're not.
Just listen

24
00:01:07,167 --> 00:01:09,701
to what I witnessed yesterday.

25
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:12,267
Baby, you mind washing that?

26
00:01:12,267 --> 00:01:15,400
No problem.

27
00:01:16,150 --> 00:01:17,484
I should go.

28
00:01:18,684 --> 00:01:22,850
She makes him wash his dishes
right away, Ted.

29
00:01:22,850 --> 00:01:25,618
I give 'em two,
maybe, three weeks tops.

30
00:01:25,618 --> 00:01:28,050
Barney, that's not a big deal.
And it's certainly

31
00:01:28,050 --> 00:01:30,384
not a big enough deal for you
to be holding my hands.

32
00:01:31,551 --> 00:01:33,084
They're in big trouble, Ted.

33
00:01:33,084 --> 00:01:34,417
I see what's going on.

34
00:01:34,417 --> 00:01:37,317
You, my friend, are suffering
from a little known condition--

35
00:01:37,317 --> 00:01:39,551
"little known" because I just
made it up--

36
00:01:39,551 --> 00:01:42,384
called New Relationship
Smugness.

37
00:01:42,384 --> 00:01:45,117
You and Robin are
in the honeymoon phase.

38
00:01:45,117 --> 00:01:46,651
Everything's perfect.

39
00:01:46,651 --> 00:01:48,484
Every song on the radio's
about you.

40
00:01:48,484 --> 00:01:49,984
Every other couple sucks.

41
00:01:49,984 --> 00:01:52,551
Enjoy it.
N.R.S. doesn't last forever.

42
00:01:52,551 --> 00:01:55,184
It does when
you're this awesome.

43
00:01:55,184 --> 00:01:56,917
Hey, check it out.
Robin and I have been

44
00:01:56,917 --> 00:01:59,117
keeping a tally of how many beds
we've done it in.

45
00:01:59,117 --> 00:02:01,251
We're up to 83-and-a-half.

46
00:02:01,251 --> 00:02:02,184
A half?

47
00:02:02,184 --> 00:02:03,584
19 century ottoman

48
00:02:03,584 --> 00:02:04,883
in an antique shop.

49
00:02:06,717 --> 00:02:08,784
Hey.
Hey, what'up?

50
00:02:08,784 --> 00:02:11,117
Hey, tiger.

51
00:02:11,117 --> 00:02:13,151
How ya holding up?
Do you need a hug?

52
00:02:13,151 --> 00:02:14,817
You want to talk
about yesterday?

53
00:02:14,817 --> 00:02:16,117
Safe space.

54
00:02:16,117 --> 00:02:18,650
Barney thinks Lily
asking you to wash your dishes

55
00:02:18,650 --> 00:02:21,617
right away is a sign your
marriage is crumbling. What?

56
00:02:21,617 --> 00:02:22,717
Why?

57
00:02:22,717 --> 00:02:24,418
Lily likes a clean sink,
so I do the dishes

58
00:02:24,418 --> 00:02:25,583
right away;
what's the big deal?

59
00:02:25,583 --> 00:02:29,184
I'll tell you
what the big deal is.

60
00:02:29,184 --> 00:02:32,817
You know how I was always
the best at being single?

61
00:02:32,817 --> 00:02:34,151
No.
No.

62
00:02:34,151 --> 00:02:37,583
Well, now I am the best
at relationships.

63
00:02:37,583 --> 00:02:39,351
Even better than you and Lily.

64
00:02:39,351 --> 00:02:41,351
Aw, look at you.

65
00:02:41,351 --> 00:02:43,384
Had a girlfriend for five
minutes, you think you can

66
00:02:43,384 --> 00:02:46,084
play with the big boys--
adorable. Son...

67
00:02:46,084 --> 00:02:48,351
I've been in a relationship
since you had a ponytail

68
00:02:48,351 --> 00:02:50,683
and were playing Dave Matthews
on your mama's Casio.

69
00:02:50,683 --> 00:02:51,884
I'm a good boyfriend

70
00:02:51,884 --> 00:02:54,451
in my sleep.
I can rock a killer foot rub

71
00:02:54,451 --> 00:02:57,518
with one hand and brew a
kick-ass pot of chamomile

72
00:02:57,518 --> 00:02:59,251
in the other that
would make you weep.

73
00:02:59,251 --> 00:03:00,351
Hell,

74
00:03:00,351 --> 00:03:02,151
I've forgotten more
about microwaving

75
00:03:02,151 --> 00:03:03,418
fat-free popcorn
and watching

76
00:03:03,418 --> 00:03:05,151
Sandra Bullock movies
than you'll ever know,

77
00:03:05,151 --> 00:03:08,351
but thanks for
your concern, rook.

78
00:03:08,351 --> 00:03:10,817
Mashall, let me ask you
one question.

79
00:03:10,817 --> 00:03:12,051
Sure.

80
00:03:12,051 --> 00:03:15,017
Do you mind if there is
sink full of dirty dishes?

81
00:03:15,017 --> 00:03:16,917
Not really.

82
00:03:16,917 --> 00:03:19,251
Then it's Lily's problem,
not yours.

83
00:03:19,251 --> 00:03:20,984
Yeah, but if I said
that to her,

84
00:03:20,984 --> 00:03:22,950
it would only lead
to a fight, so...
Oh.

85
00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:24,117
You fight.

86
00:03:24,117 --> 00:03:25,451
See, Robin and I never fight.

87
00:03:25,451 --> 00:03:27,683
Of course you do.
No.

88
00:03:27,683 --> 00:03:30,284
And here's the secret:
evy time it looks like

89
00:03:30,284 --> 00:03:31,950
we're about to get
into a fight...

90
00:03:31,950 --> 00:03:33,784
Um, why is there

91
00:03:33,784 --> 00:03:38,151
a bag of panties labeled
"April 2008" in your closet?

92
00:03:50,617 --> 00:03:52,750
So any time you think
you might have a fight

93
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:53,950
you just get up and leave?

94
00:03:53,950 --> 00:03:55,817
100% effective.

95
00:03:55,817 --> 00:03:57,351
Can't fight
if you're not there.

96
00:03:57,351 --> 00:03:59,017
at's what Gandhi taught us.

97
00:03:59,017 --> 00:04:02,305
Boy, that'not true.

98
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:04,050
I can't believe that
Robin puts up with that.

99
00:04:04,050 --> 00:04:05,184
Oh, don't worry.

100
00:04:05,184 --> 00:04:07,384
She's got a great way
to avoid fights, too.

101
00:04:07,384 --> 00:04:10,517
Um, are ties
machine washable?

102
00:04:10,517 --> 00:04:14,250
No, they most ceainly
are not. Why?

103
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:17,417
What is in your hand?

104
00:04:17,417 --> 00:04:19,584
Oh, my God,
what's in your hand?!

105
00:04:25,651 --> 00:04:27,684
Okay, so you walk away.

106
00:04:27,684 --> 00:04:28,784
Robin gets naked.

107
00:04:28,784 --> 00:04:30,384
Those are the two
stupidest ways

108
00:04:30,384 --> 00:04:31,751
to handle conflict
I've ever heard.

109
00:04:31,751 --> 00:04:33,684
Actually, the naked
thing ain't ba

110
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:38,717
That felt kind of weird.
Okay, call me crazy.

111
00:04:38,717 --> 00:04:40,417
a problem comes up,
Lily and I

112
00:04:40,417 --> 00:04:41,884
actually talk about it.

113
00:04:41,884 --> 00:04:44,284
There are so many great things
to do withhe human mouth.

114
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:46,451
Why waste it on talking?

115
00:04:46,451 --> 00:04:48,417
But if you insist,
here's what I would say

116
00:04:48,417 --> 00:04:51,284
about the dishes
if I were Lily's husband.

117
00:04:52,083 --> 00:04:53,918
Barney, you're home!

118
00:04:58,784 --> 00:04:59,950
Get to the point!

119
00:04:59,950 --> 00:05:01,050
All right.

120
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:03,184
Thanks, doll.

121
00:05:06,484 --> 00:05:08,651
Sweetie, are you
going to wash that?

122
00:05:08,651 --> 00:05:10,884
I'm glad you bring that up. No.

123
00:05:10,884 --> 00:05:12,417
And here's why.

124
00:05:15,818 --> 00:05:18,451
Lily, I know you don't
like a dirty sink.

125
00:05:18,451 --> 00:05:20,517
But does that make it my job
to keep it clean?

126
00:05:20,517 --> 00:05:21,517
I mean, if one day

127
00:05:21,517 --> 00:05:23,517
I lookp
at the living room ceiling

128
00:05:23,517 --> 00:05:25,150
and ink,
"Hey, I'd like a replica

129
00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:26,484
of the Sistine Chal up there."

130
00:05:26,484 --> 00:05:28,017
would it be your job
to paint it?

131
00:05:28,017 --> 00:05:31,881
Well, no.
Of course not.

132
00:05:31,881 --> 00:05:32,751
Exactly! So, baby,
by the same logic,

133
00:05:32,751 --> 00:05:36,484
if you don't like looking
at a sink full of dishes,

134
00:05:36,484 --> 00:05:39,684
Wow. Thanks for
explaining that.

135
00:05:39,684 --> 00:05:41,584
I get so confused.

136
00:05:41,584 --> 00:05:43,451
That's because
you're a woman.

137
00:05:45,851 --> 00:05:47,584
I don't even know
why we're laughing!

138
00:05:47,584 --> 00:05:51,351
Of course you don't.

139
00:05:54,717 --> 00:05:56,417
You're kidding me with this.

140
00:05:56,417 --> 00:05:57,417
Hang on, Ted.

141
00:05:57,417 --> 00:05:58,950
Let's ar the man out.

142
00:05:58,950 --> 00:06:00,850
Once I have her attention,

143
00:06:00,850 --> 00:06:03,518
it's time
to bring out the big guns.

144
00:06:03,518 --> 00:06:06,117
Look, I love you.

145
00:06:06,117 --> 00:06:09,618
But, baby, with the little
energy I have left after work,

146
00:06:09,618 --> 00:06:11,950
I want to shower you with love,

147
00:06:11,950 --> 00:06:14,284
not wash some silly dishes.

148
00:06:14,284 --> 00:06:17,251
You're right.
I'll do the dishes.

149
00:06:17,251 --> 00:06:20,084
Right after I do this.

150
00:06:23,351 --> 00:06:25,884
Oh, yeah.

151
00:06:25,884 --> 00:06:27,050
Now turn around.

152
00:06:30,650 --> 00:06:32,518
Fi.

153
00:06:32,518 --> 00:06:33,717
Oh, yeah.

154
00:06:33,717 --> 00:06:35,384
Are you going to
hit him or should I?

155
00:06:35,384 --> 00:06:36,618
He's right.

156
00:06:36,618 --> 00:06:39,683
No, he's not.
Marshall, lookt me.

157
00:06:39,683 --> 00:06:42,050
Do not get drawn into
Barney Stinson's circus tent

158
00:06:42,050 --> 00:06:43,750
of funhouse mirrors
and flawed logic.

159
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:46,251
This is exactly how you got
the earring back in '03.

160
00:06:46,251 --> 00:06:47,451
Hey, that earring looked cool.

161
00:06:47,451 --> 00:06:48,917
It did look
cool, didn't it?

162
00:06:48,917 --> 00:06:51,884
Marsll, stay with me!
Barney is wrong.

163
00:06:52,850 --> 00:06:54,284
No, he isn't.

164
00:06:55,217 --> 00:06:57,484
I hate doing my
dishes right away.

165
00:06:57,484 --> 00:06:58,683
You just said
you don't mind!

166
00:06:58,683 --> 00:06:59,884
I hate it, Ted!

167
00:06:59,884 --> 00:07:00,917
I hate it

168
00:07:00,917 --> 00:07:02,618
with a boundless,
burning fury!

169
00:07:02,618 --> 00:07:05,484
I ha it, I hate
it, I hate it!

170
00:07:05,484 --> 00:07:06,717
You're welcome.

171
00:07:06,717 --> 00:07:07,683
Hey, guys.

172
00:07:07,683 --> 00:07:08,817
Hey.
Oh, good.

173
00:07:08,817 --> 00:07:09,884
There you are.

174
00:07:09,884 --> 00:07:10,950
You'll tell me the truth.

175
00:07:10,950 --> 00:07:13,618
Barney says
that you two never fight.

176
00:07:13,618 --> 00:07:15,584
Huh. I guess
that's true.

177
00:07:15,584 --> 00:07:16,584
Told ya.

178
00:07:16,584 --> 00:07:19,284
No way.
I love you both,

179
00:07:19,284 --> 00:07:21,417
but you are the two most
emotionally ill-equipped

180
00:07:21,417 --> 00:07:23,317
individuals in the history
of relationships.

181
00:07:23,317 --> 00:07:25,518
You two must have had
at least one fight.

182
00:07:25,518 --> 00:07:27,417
You know what?
We did.

183
00:07:27,417 --> 00:07:28,518
Aha!
ROBIN: Mm-hmm.

184
00:07:28,518 --> 00:07:29,817
There was
one small dispute

185
00:07:29,817 --> 00:07:34,184
about which one of
us was morawesome.

186
00:07:34,184 --> 00:07:37,317
Speaking of which, I am so gla
we're going skiing this weekend.

187
00:07:37,317 --> 00:07:38,451
I need a break.

188
00:07:39,751 --> 00:07:42,017
The upstairs neighbors
are driving me crazy.

189
00:07:42,017 --> 00:07:43,317
Yeah, it's bad.

190
00:07:43,317 --> 00:07:44,950
m gonna say
something to them.

191
00:07:44,950 --> 00:07:45,851
Thanyou.
Great.

192
00:07:45,851 --> 00:07:46,950
Okay, we all have

193
00:07:46,950 --> 00:07:48,484
our assignments
r the weekend.

194
00:07:48,484 --> 00:07:49,684
Ted, you're going to stand up
to your neighbors.

195
00:07:49,684 --> 00:07:51,217
Marshall, you're going
to stand up to Lily.

196
00:07:51,217 --> 00:07:53,484
And Robin, I'm gonna need yo
in sort of a crouched position

197
00:07:53,484 --> 00:07:55,584
on the bear-skin rug
at our ski chalet. Ready?

198
00:07:55,584 --> 00:07:56,651
Break!

199
00:07:56,651 --> 00:07:57,950
Bye, guys.Bye.

200
00:07:57,950 --> 00:07:59,617
Have fun.

201
00:08:00,784 --> 00:08:03,584
Barney.

202
00:08:03,584 --> 00:08:05,983
With his crazy, well-
thought-out theories

203
00:08:05,983 --> 00:08:07,150
that probably would work.

204
00:08:07,150 --> 00:08:10,350
Marsll, I'm just gonna
say this one more time.

205
00:08:10,350 --> 00:08:12,150
It's a bad ide

206
00:08:12,150 --> 00:08:13,250
I think it could work.

207
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:15,517
Okay, two more times.
It's a bad idea.

208
00:08:15,517 --> 00:08:17,217
Listen, Barney lays out
some logical points

209
00:08:17,217 --> 00:08:18,684
Lily is a
reasonable woman.

210
00:08:18,684 --> 00:08:20,651
I think th if I
explain it to her,

211
00:08:20,651 --> 00:08:22,818
she'llet it and
I'll get my way.

212
00:08:22,818 --> 00:08:24,517
Uh, no.
She'll get mad,

213
00:08:24,517 --> 00:08:26,217
and yoll get
in a huge fight.

214
00:08:26,217 --> 00:08:27,784
Slap bet?
ap bet.

215
00:08:31,050 --> 00:08:33,584
Baby, could youwa
sh your dishes?

216
00:08:33,584 --> 00:08:38,588
Lily, I'm glad
that you bring that up.

217
00:08:43,333 --> 00:08:43,333
Can I stay here tonight?

218
00:08:56,017 --> 00:08:57,417
The ski bunnies
are back!

219
00:08:57,417 --> 00:08:59,117
(both laughing)
Hey, guys.

220
00:08:59,117 --> 00:09:00,551
(smooching loudly)
How was your trip?

221
00:09:00,551 --> 00:09:02,350
So perfect.

222
00:09:02,350 --> 00:09:04,851
We just spent the whole
weekend cuddling by the re.

223
00:09:04,851 --> 00:09:06,017
No black diamonds,

224
00:09:06,017 --> 00:09:07,918
but a lot of
red hearts.
Aw...

225
00:09:09,484 --> 00:09:10,818
Okay, I'm gonna
go unpack.

226
00:09:10,818 --> 00:09:12,684
Hey, you.
Yeah?

227
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:21,551
Oh, man.

228
00:09:21,551 --> 00:09:23,384
What the hell has
gotten into you two?

229
00:09:23,384 --> 00:09:25,451
When did you become
so nauseating?

230
00:09:25,451 --> 00:09:28,684
Isn't it great
to finally see her fulfilled

231
00:09:28,684 --> 00:09:31,684
emotionally, spiritually
and sexually?

232
00:09:31,684 --> 00:09:34,451
Um, I dated her
for a year.

233
00:09:34,451 --> 00:09:36,117
Yeah.

234
00:09:36,117 --> 00:09:37,517
Anyway,
w was your weekend?

235
00:09:37,517 --> 00:09:39,851
Terrible, and it's all
your fault, okay?

236
00:09:39,851 --> 00:09:41,884
I took your stup advice!

237
00:09:43,551 --> 00:09:45,950
Baby, could you
wash your dishes?

238
00:09:45,950 --> 00:09:49,250
Lily, I'm glad
th you bring that up.

239
00:09:49,918 --> 00:09:53,584
No, and here is why...

240
00:10:01,217 --> 00:10:02,317
Okay.

241
00:10:03,950 --> 00:10:07,317
So, it's like this, okay?

242
00:10:07,317 --> 00:10:09,884
Yeah, sure.
You wa me

243
00:10:09,884 --> 00:10:12,050
to go ahead
and wash my dish.

244
00:10:12,050 --> 00:10:13,350
But maybe...

245
00:10:13,350 --> 00:10:15,517
I nt you...

246
00:10:15,517 --> 00:10:18,851
to pai
the ceiling, right?

247
00:10:18,851 --> 00:10:20,184
Like, maybe I should say,

248
00:10:20,184 --> 00:10:23,050
"Okay, yeah.
I'll wash my dish

249
00:10:23,050 --> 00:10:24,317
"if you get up the

250
00:10:24,317 --> 00:10:27,184
and just--you paint
naked babies on the ceiling."

251
00:10:27,184 --> 00:10:29,983
You know?
It just like...

252
00:10:31,884 --> 00:10:34,284
I don't know what happened.

253
00:10:34,284 --> 00:10:35,684
I'm a lawyer.

254
00:10:35,684 --> 00:10:36,983
I argue for a living,

255
00:10:36,983 --> 00:10:40,250
but when it comes to Lily,
I just get all. flustered.

256
00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:41,350
How could you not?

257
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:45,988
I an, the girl's
all eyes and boobs.

258
00:10:45,988 --> 00:10:49,446
What happened to the "I'm tired
after my draining day,

259
00:10:49,284 --> 00:10:50,484
showering you
with love" argument?

260
00:10:50,484 --> 00:10:55,617
I should have written that down.

261
00:10:55,617 --> 00:10:57,723
Look, Lily, I...

262
00:10:58,858 --> 00:10:59,284
I  make more money than you.

263
00:10:59,284 --> 00:11:01,641
Excuse me?!

264
00:11:02,417 --> 00:11:05,050
Dance for me.

265
00:11:05,050 --> 00:11:06,018
Oh, Marshall.

266
00:11:06,018 --> 00:11:07,183
Dude.

267
00:11:07,183 --> 00:11:09,717
It all made so much sense
when you said it,

268
00:11:09,717 --> 00:11:11,884
but when I said it,
iturned into a fight.

269
00:11:11,884 --> 00:11:13,384
And ce Lily and I
start fighting,

270
00:11:13,384 --> 00:11:16,617
the fight starts to mutate
and multly.

271
00:11:16,617 --> 00:11:19,083
<i>MARSHALL:Sure, it started
with the dishes, but then...</i>

272
00:11:19,083 --> 00:11:22,651
So you're saying that you
shouldn't have to wash dishes

273
00:11:22,651 --> 00:11:24,551
because you work
harder than me?

274
00:11:24,551 --> 00:11:26,551
Okay, that's not
what I'm saying--

275
00:11:26,551 --> 00:11:27,817
but it's true.

276
00:11:27,817 --> 00:11:29,651
<i>And th all of sudden,
we're also fighting</i>

277
00:11:29,651 --> 00:11:32,284
<i>about who works harder.</i>

278
00:11:32,284 --> 00:11:37,217
I am molding the future
leaders of tomorrow.

279
00:11:37,217 --> 00:11:38,751
<i>And soon morfights spin off.</i>

280
00:11:38,751 --> 00:11:40,250
I can't believe you'd rather
be killed...

281
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:41,684
<i>Until there are
more fights going on</i>

282
00:11:41,684 --> 00:11:43,284
<i>than you can even
keep track of.</i>

283
00:11:43,284 --> 00:11:45,717
If you need to go
in t middle
of the night,

284
00:11:45,717 --> 00:11:48,050
either turn the bathroom
light on or sit down.

285
00:11:48,050 --> 00:11:50,250
My mother
does not hate you.

286
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:52,617
She is neutral
about you.

287
00:11:52,617 --> 00:11:55,350
<i>I am not scared of
your Shining impression.</i>

288
00:11:55,350 --> 00:11:58,317
I just don need to hear
it, especially at night.

289
00:11:58,317 --> 00:12:00,018
(gravelly voice):
Danny's not here,

290
00:12:00,018 --> 00:12:01,183
Mrs. Torrance.

291
00:12:01,183 --> 00:12:04,784
Please don't do that.

292
00:12:04,784 --> 00:12:06,584
Man, Ly fights dirty.

293
00:12:06,584 --> 00:12:10,551
She's small
but vicious like aadger

294
00:12:10,551 --> 00:12:12,517
that your brother's caught
and starved for ve days

295
00:12:12,517 --> 00:12:15,350
and then put
in your sleeng bag.

296
00:12:15,350 --> 00:12:16,984
I should just go home
and apologize.

297
00:12:16,984 --> 00:12:19,851
No. What you need
is a surge.

298
00:12:19,851 --> 00:12:21,217
Fight harder.

299
00:12:22,050 --> 00:12:23,751
Picture it, Marshall,

300
00:12:23,751 --> 00:12:26,417
never having to wash
another dish as long
as you live,

301
00:12:26,417 --> 00:12:28,584
yet all the dishes
aralways clean.

302
00:12:28,584 --> 00:12:31,784
Why, this would take
all thanxiety out
of snacking.

303
00:12:31,784 --> 00:12:34,284
No more holding
open your shirt

304
00:12:34,284 --> 00:12:37,484
to form a makeshift bowl
for yo salty treats.

305
00:12:37,484 --> 00:12:41,915
That world is
yours, Marshall.

306
00:12:41,584 --> 00:12:45,284
dip it in some
ranch dressing, enjoy.

307
00:12:49,850 --> 00:12:51,351
Yes, right.

308
00:12:51,351 --> 00:12:52,617
No!

309
00:12:52,617 --> 00:12:53,617
rney's stupid ideas

310
00:12:53,617 --> 00:12:55,051
are what got you
into this quagmire.

311
00:12:55,051 --> 00:12:56,884
There's noxit strategy.
Just wash your stupid dishes.

312
00:12:56,884 --> 00:12:59,017
No! Those dishes are my manhood!

313
00:12:59,017 --> 00:13:01,917
And  I want to leave my
manhood dirty in the sink,

314
00:13:01,917 --> 00:13:03,217
caked with ketchup and pasta...

315
00:13:03,217 --> 00:13:04,151
What are you eating?

316
00:13:04,151 --> 00:13:06,317
...then damn it,
that's my rit!

317
00:13:06,317 --> 00:13:09,518
I'll wash my manhood
when I'mood and ready!

318
00:13:09,518 --> 00:13:11,151
Where was he not sitting?

319
00:13:11,850 --> 00:13:14,184
Hey, Barnstormer.

320
00:13:14,184 --> 00:13:16,650
He Ro-Ro.
Ooh!

321
00:13:16,650 --> 00:13:18,717
Okay, now you have
adorable nicknames?

322
00:13:18,717 --> 00:13:20,884
Seriously, what's going on
with your two?

323
00:13:20,884 --> 00:13:22,518
Nothing. We're just happy.

324
00:13:22,518 --> 00:13:24,084
It's like Gandhi said,

325
00:13:24,084 --> 00:13:25,917
"A smile don't
cost nothing, gar."
Mm-hmm.

326
00:13:25,917 --> 00:13:28,484
I'm not sure you know
whGandhi is.

327
00:13:28,484 --> 00:13:30,418
So, um, Ted, did you
talk to our neighbors?

328
00:13:30,418 --> 00:13:32,184
Yes, yeah, I did.

329
00:13:32,184 --> 00:13:35,051
I went up therready
to set them straight.

330
00:13:45,784 --> 00:13:46,817
They're old?

331
00:13:46,817 --> 00:13:48,217
Really old.

332
00:13:48,217 --> 00:13:50,184
So what did you do?

333
00:13:50,184 --> 00:13:52,484
Well, didn't have the heart
to tell them to stop,

334
00:13:52,484 --> 00:13:53,784
because, well, good for them.

335
00:13:53,784 --> 00:13:55,617
So I just weomed them
to the building,

336
00:13:55,617 --> 00:13:56,917
had a hard candy,

337
00:13:56,917 --> 00:13:59,950
nodded politely at some racist
comments and then left.

338
00:14:00,850 --> 00:14:02,484
<i>Over the next couple of days</i>

339
00:14:02,484 --> 00:14:06,084
<i>Barney and Robin continued
to be happier than ever.</i>

340
00:14:06,084 --> 00:14:08,351
<i>And Marshall and Lily
continued to fight.</i>

341
00:14:08,351 --> 00:14:10,950
I don't care if
the dishes aren't done.

342
00:14:10,950 --> 00:14:12,717
Okay, if you care, you do it.

343
00:14:12,717 --> 00:14:16,117
Great. Then I don't care
if you have an orgasm.

344
00:14:16,117 --> 00:14:17,950
If you care, you do it.

345
00:14:17,950 --> 00:14:21,151
I went 18 years without
the touch of a woman.

346
00:14:21,151 --> 00:14:22,484
can do it again.

347
00:14:22,484 --> 00:14:24,217
You might have to.

348
00:14:24,217 --> 00:14:26,750
<i>And I continued to hear
more bagpiping</i>

349
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:30,297
<i>than a St. Patty's Day parad</i>

350
00:14:35,317 --> 00:14:37,018
I don't know what to do.

351
00:14:37,018 --> 00:14:39,050
Lily and I have never
had a fight this long.

352
00:14:39,050 --> 00:14:40,484
It's like I don't
even exist.

353
00:14:40,484 --> 00:14:43,517
On Sunday morning,
she made pancake, Ted.

354
00:14:43,517 --> 00:14:46,083
Pancake and bacon strip.

355
00:14:46,083 --> 00:14:47,751
It's your own fault.

356
00:14:47,751 --> 00:14:50,717
You took relationship
advice from Barney.

357
00:14:50,717 --> 00:14:53,751
Well, maybe Barney
has it all figured out.

358
00:14:53,751 --> 00:14:56,717
He and Ro-Ro are
the best couple now.

359
00:14:56,717 --> 00:14:58,784
Lily and I have
been dethroned.

360
00:14:58,784 --> 00:15:00,217
You know what,
I'm not buying i

361
00:15:00,217 --> 00:15:01,951
All that cutesy,
lovey-dovey crap,

362
00:15:01,951 --> 00:15:03,183
that's not them.

363
00:15:03,183 --> 00:15:06,217
And I know for a factthat Robin hates ni

364
00:15:07,484 --> 00:15:08,884
Thanks, Robbsy-wobbsy.

365
00:15:08,884 --> 00:15:11,717
Yeah, I dot do nicknames.

366
00:15:11,717 --> 00:15:14,083
Finished with the
sports page, Sherbs?

367
00:15:14,083 --> 00:15:16,317
Seriously, stop.

368
00:15:17,317 --> 00:15:19,484
Hey, Robin, it's T-Mose.

369
00:15:19,484 --> 00:15:21,217
Yeah, I don't like them
on you either.

370
00:15:22,183 --> 00:15:24,384
Well, she obviously
likes them now.

371
00:15:24,384 --> 00:15:26,083
And, come on

372
00:15:26,083 --> 00:15:28,484
somebody had to put
an end to T-Mose.

373
00:15:28,484 --> 00:15:31,317
No, T-Mose w awesome.

374
00:15:31,317 --> 00:15:33,717
I'm thinking
of bringing it back.

375
00:15:35,183 --> 00:15:38,117
Bagpiping sounds
a little different today.

376
00:15:38,117 --> 00:15:39,951
It's all echo-y.

377
00:15:39,951 --> 00:15:41,384
Yeah. They're
in the bathroom.

378
00:15:41,384 --> 00:15:43,884
I think they're bagpiping
on the shower chair.

379
00:15:43,884 --> 00:15:45,918
<i>And just like that, I realized</i>

380
00:15:45,918 --> 00:15:48,651
<i>exactly how to get the real
scoop on Barney and Robin.</i>

381
00:15:48,651 --> 00:15:50,751
, hey, Ted.
How are Marshall and Lily?

382
00:15:50,751 --> 00:15:52,851
I worry about those two,
I really do.

383
00:15:52,851 --> 00:15:54,484
You and your
big, giant heart.

384
00:15:54,484 --> 00:15:57,317
Okay, enough.
The jig is up.

385
00:15:57,317 --> 00:16:00,417
Ted, whatever do you mean?

386
00:16:00,417 --> 00:16:01,417
Who's this guy?

387
00:16:01,417 --> 00:16:02,717
We'll get to that.

388
00:16:02,717 --> 00:16:04,617
You see, I knew
something was wrong.

389
00:16:04,617 --> 00:16:09,711
u two were too happy,
too shiny, too nickname-y.

390
00:16:09,746 --> 00:16:10,742
Didn't add up.

391
00:16:10,742 --> 00:16:12,282
You two never fight?

392
00:16:12,282 --> 00:16:13,481
Horse apples.

393
00:16:14,112 --> 00:16:18,323
You fight all... the. time.

394
00:16:18,323 --> 00:16:21,000
How would you know that?

395
00:16:20,784 --> 00:16:23,947
Who the hell is Phil?

396
00:16:23,982 --> 00:16:25,612
Your downstairs neighbor.

397
00:16:25,647 --> 00:16:29,346
Hi. I'm Phil. 12-B.

398
00:16:37,017 --> 00:16:38,984
So Phil tells me that
Ro-Ro and the Barnstormer

399
00:16:38,984 --> 00:16:41,283
have been
fighting... a lot.

400
00:16:41,283 --> 00:16:42,751
Care to explain?

401
00:16:46,350 --> 00:16:49,317
Okay. Everything
was going great.

402
00:16:49,317 --> 00:16:52,051
Our no-fighting techniques
were working perfectly

403
00:16:52,051 --> 00:16:54,851
until we went on
thatki trip
last weekend.

404
00:16:54,851 --> 00:16:58,550
So I showed Marshall
that Lily's argument
was bananas

405
00:16:58,550 --> 00:17:01,084
and now he'll never have
to wash another dish.

406
00:17:01,084 --> 00:17:02,517
High two.

407
00:17:02,517 --> 00:17:03,884
That's terrible advice.

408
00:17:03,884 --> 00:17:06,218
You agree with Lily?

409
00:17:06,218 --> 00:17:07,417
You...

410
00:17:10,650 --> 00:17:13,751
<i>BARNEY:
Oh, no. We're about
to get in a fight,</i>

411
00:17:13,751 --> 00:17:14,951
<i>and I can't run away.</i>

412
00:17:14,951 --> 00:17:17,118
<i>ROBIN:
I can't take my clothes off.</i>

413
00:17:17,118 --> 00:17:19,151
<i>It's freezing up here.
I get hypothermia.</i>

414
00:17:19,151 --> 00:17:22,317
<i>Maybe I can jump it?
Maybe just my pants?</i>

415
00:17:24,784 --> 00:17:28,951
This no-fighting thing
is over, huh?
I think so.

416
00:17:28,951 --> 00:17:33,184
How could you possibly
agree with Lily?!
I can't believe that you made
Lily get in a fight about this!

417
00:17:33,184 --> 00:17:34,550
She's shortethan him!

418
00:17:34,550 --> 00:17:36,283
And it didn't end there.

419
00:17:36,283 --> 00:17:37,350
We've been fighting
ever since.

420
00:17:37,350 --> 00:17:39,717
All those fightse
kept not having--

421
00:17:39,717 --> 00:17:42,118
they all came back around.

422
00:17:42,118 --> 00:17:43,184
The tie Robin murdered.

423
00:17:43,184 --> 00:17:44,951
The tiny camera I foundin th

424
00:17:44,951 --> 00:17:46,784
That's how a
quarterback sts sharp.

425
00:17:46,784 --> 00:17:48,484
Monday morning, he sits
on a bag of ic

426
00:17:48,484 --> 00:17:50,484
and studies the game tape.
Barney for the
millionth time...

427
00:17:50,484 --> 00:17:52,951
You don't get to be
as good as I am...
using football analogies...

428
00:17:52,951 --> 00:17:54,283
without reviewingthe fundamentals

429
00:17:54,283 --> 00:17:55,884
and studying technique!
does not make it
any less creepy.

479
00:17:54,384 --> 00:17:57,779
Whoo, yeah!

430
00:17:55,884 --> 00:17:59,717
I knew it! I knew you
guys were acting too
cute and perfect!

431
00:17:59,717 --> 00:18:03,017
Look, we were just sick
of everyone pointing out

432
00:18:03,017 --> 00:18:04,784
how crappy a
relationships we both are.

433
00:18:04,784 --> 00:18:07,917
Yeah, it was sort of nice
to be the perfect couplefor a

434
00:18:07,917 --> 00:18:09,484
TED:
I knew you were lying.

435
00:18:09,484 --> 00:18:12,751
You got to wake up pretty early
to slip one by the T-Mose.

436
00:18:12,751 --> 00:18:15,517
Stop it.

437
00:18:15,517 --> 00:18:18,151
LILY (singsong voice):
Marshall, dinner's ready.

438
00:18:18,151 --> 00:18:20,851
Did you-- did you make
any for me?

439
00:18:20,851 --> 00:18:23,517
No, but it's
your favorite.

440
00:18:30,517 --> 00:18:32,417
(sighing):
Hey.

441
00:18:32,417 --> 00:18:34,417
We need your advice.

442
00:18:34,417 --> 00:18:36,417
<i>NARRATOR:
So Barney and Robin toldLily and M</i>

443
00:18:36,417 --> 00:18:37,650
<i>l about their fighting.</i>

444
00:18:37,650 --> 00:18:38,984
<i>And let's just say,
that in comparison,</i>

445
00:18:38,984 --> 00:18:45,018
<i>their little dishes spat
seemed pretty tame.</i>

446
00:18:55,284 --> 00:18:56,618
<i>And byhe end,</i>

447
00:18:56,618 --> 00:18:58,984
<i>Lily and Marshall
both had the same reaction.</i>

448
00:18:58,984 --> 00:19:02,117
I'll wash my dishes right away
from now until the day I die.

449
00:19:02,117 --> 00:19:03,484
I don't care when
you wash the dishes.

450
00:19:03,484 --> 00:19:06,850
But if it's something
chse-based like
a nice ziti,

451
00:19:06,850 --> 00:19:08,884
at least soak it, okay?
Of course, baby.

452
00:19:08,884 --> 00:19:10,050
Oh, I love you.

453
00:19:10,050 --> 00:19:12,683
I love you, too.
ROBIN: See?

454
00:19:12,683 --> 00:19:14,217
Right there,
how did you just do that?

455
00:19:14,217 --> 00:19:15,251
How'd you just
fix everything?

456
00:19:15,251 --> 00:19:16,551
I don't know.

457
00:19:16,551 --> 00:19:19,217
I guess sometimes you just
have to set your ego aside.

458
00:19:19,217 --> 00:19:22,351
Yeah. An-And remember
at the love that you have

459
00:19:22,351 --> 00:19:25,917
for that other person
is way more important
than winning.

460
00:19:30,584 --> 00:19:32,650
More important
than winning

461
00:19:32,650 --> 00:19:34,084
Stop, op it.

462
00:19:34,084 --> 00:19:36,050
Seriously,
what's the secret?

463
00:19:36,050 --> 00:19:39,650
Okay, look, the honeymoon period
may be over,

464
00:19:39,650 --> 00:19:42,984
but now you can get
into the real stuff.

465
00:19:42,984 --> 00:19:44,217
And honestly,

466
00:19:44,217 --> 00:19:46,317
that's the best part.

467
00:19:46,317 --> 00:19:47,417
Good night.

468
00:19:47,417 --> 00:19:49,584
So what do
we do now?

469
00:19:49,584 --> 00:19:51,518
I guess we got to
start talking more

470
00:19:51,518 --> 00:19:52,750
and get into
the real stuff.

471
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:54,184
Yeah.

472
00:19:54,184 --> 00:19:55,683
Or there's a bench
in the elevator.

473
00:19:55,683 --> 00:19:57,050
Ooh, that's better.
Mm-hmm.

474
00:19:57,050 --> 00:19:59,351
Hey, swhat if we're
not the best couple
in the world?

475
00:19:59,351 --> 00:20:01,817
Totally. It's not
a competition.
No.

476
00:20:01,817 --> 00:20:02,850
We win!

477
00:20:02,850 --> 00:20:04,484
Best couple in the world!

478
00:20:04,484 --> 00:20:07,879
Whoo, yeah!

480
00:20:09,117 --> 00:20:10,384
Guess what?

481
00:20:10,384 --> 00:20:11,484
These glasses

482
00:20:11,484 --> 00:20:13,151
are plastic.

483
00:20:13,151 --> 00:20:15,284
So we can just
throw them away.

484
00:20:15,284 --> 00:20:17,950
That means no dirty
dishes in the sink.

485
00:20:17,950 --> 00:20:20,017
Mm, you're dirty.

486
00:20:20,017 --> 00:20:22,284
Maybe I shouldeave
you in the sink.
