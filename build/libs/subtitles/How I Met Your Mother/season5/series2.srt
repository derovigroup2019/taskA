Marshall, now that Robin
and I are together,

41
00:02:08,061 --> 00:02:11,155
I've learned a lot about relationships
by watching you and Lily.

42
00:02:11,231 --> 00:02:13,893
- Thanks, man.
- You're a terrible couple.

Lily has taken all the man out of you.

I used to think
that's just every relationship.

45
00:02:17,637 --> 00:02:20,902
But what I've got with Robin proves
that you can have a girlfriend

46
00:02:20,974 --> 00:02:24,671
and fully functioning male genitalia
all at the same time.

47
00:02:24,744 --> 00:02:27,440
Okay, right.
So, if Robin knew that you were here,

48
00:02:27,514 --> 00:02:29,141
she would be completely fine with it?

49
00:02:29,215 --> 00:02:32,582

And seven years ago,

334
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:57,674
if you think about it,
we didn't miss by that much.

335
00:17:58,210 --> 00:18:00,770
I mean, if a couple of things
had gone a little bit differently,

336
00:18:01,947 --> 00:18:03,312
who knows what would have happened?

337
00:18:03,782 --> 00:18:05,374
<i>(REWIND</i> PLAYING)

338
00:18:10,422 --> 00:18:15,951
(SINGING) <i>Asking you to stay</i>
<i>The words are finally here</i>

339
00:18:16,195 --> 00:18:22,532
<i>Let's rewind and rewind</i>

340
00:18:24,336 --> 00:18:30,275
<i>You see, you're the only star</i>
<i>in the film I never made</i>

341
00:18:30,609 --> 00:18:37,606
<i>Would you rewind it all the time</i>
<i>Rewind it all the time</i>

342
00:18:40,652 --> 00:18:42,711
- Wow.
- Wow.

343
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:51,259
You are the best, you are the best.

344
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:54,390
My girlfriend is at a strip club with me
and she couldn't care less.

345
00:18:54,466 --> 00:18:57,833
I do care, Barney.
Look, we're dating now, okay?

346
00:18:57,903 --> 00:19:01,066
That changes things.
We need to have a serious talk about this.

347
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:03,870
- Just the best.
- Hey, girlfriend trouble?

348
00:19:03,942 --> 00:19:06,672
I wish I could help,
but my unbelievably cool wife

349
00:19:06,745 --> 00:19:09,373
just bought us a private dance
with her stripper body double.

350
00:19:09,448 --> 00:19:13,350
So, if you need me, I'll be getting grinded
like some pepper in the champagne room.

351
00:19:16,522 --> 00:19:17,750
Just the best.

352
00:19:21,994 --> 00:19:23,052
(SIGHS)

353
00:19:23,328 --> 00:19:24,454
Now what?

354
00:19:24,530 --> 00:19:26,725
I just remembered why I didn't call you.

355
00:19:26,798 --> 00:19:27,822
Why?

356
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:30,494
(SIGHING) I can't believe
I'm gonna screw this up again.

357
00:19:32,504 --> 00:19:35,837
- But I like finding typos in menus.
- What?

358
00:19:35,908 --> 00:19:39,207
And I know my shellfish pun is stupid,
but the truth is,

359
00:19:39,278 --> 00:19:41,838
I'm not suddenly gonna stop
making stupid jokes.

360
00:19:42,581 --> 00:19:44,640
Now that you mention it,

361
00:19:44,716 --> 00:19:47,651
I'm never going to stop talking
about my cats.

362
00:19:47,719 --> 00:19:52,315
They're funny and adorable and totally
worth having to take six Benadryl a day.

363
00:19:52,391 --> 00:19:53,380
(TED LAUGHS)

364
00:19:55,027 --> 00:19:58,224
Shouldn't we hold out for the person

365
00:19:58,297 --> 00:20:01,960
who doesn't just tolerate our little quirks,
but actually kind of likes them?

366
00:20:03,268 --> 00:20:06,795
Even if it means finding ourselves
on another blind date with each other

367
00:20:06,872 --> 00:20:10,638
- seven years from now?
- Oh, dear God, I hope that doesn't happen.

368
00:20:14,279 --> 00:20:18,045
Well, good luck out there, Jen.

369
00:20:19,451 --> 00:20:20,918
You, too, Ted.

370
00:20:23,288 --> 00:20:25,313
You'll find your shellfish lady.

371
00:20:29,127 --> 00:20:32,028
OLDER TED: <i>And kids, when I told</i>
<i>your mother that shellfish joke,</i>

372
00:20:32,097 --> 00:20:33,621
<i>she did laugh.</i>

373
00:20:33,699 --> 00:20:35,826
<i>And I swear, it was only, like, 30% pity.</i>

375
00:20:45,077 --> 00:20:49,446
Hey, Lil. Looks like Jasmine's having
a hard time getting out of those boots.

376
00:20:49,514 --> 00:20:50,981
(IN FOREIGN ACCENT)
What did you say, buddy?

377
00:20:52,985 --> 00:20:55,681
- Lily?
- Who?

378
00:20:55,754 --> 00:20:58,951
Oh, yes, I am this Lily.

379
00:20:59,558 --> 00:21:02,186
We married long time.

380
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:04,229
May I have monies for shopping?

00:21:06,632 --> 00:21:08,099
