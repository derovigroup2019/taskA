Would you just have the talk, okay?

165
00:08:36,082 --> 00:08:39,483
It's a five-minute conversation,
and then you get to have sex afterwards.

166
00:08:39,552 --> 00:08:41,645
It's great! Back me up, Ted.

167
00:08:42,288 --> 00:08:44,620
- I don't think the talk is necessary.
- (HIGH-PITCHED) What?

168
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:45,952
Thank you, Ted.

169
00:08:46,025 --> 00:08:48,323
Because Robin is already his girlfriend.

170
00:08:48,394 --> 00:08:49,588
(HIGH-PITCHED) What?

171
00:08:49,662 --> 00:08:52,062
MacLaren's Bar, four years ago.

172
00:08:52,665 --> 00:08:55,099
How do you keep a girl
from becoming your girlfriend?

173
00:08:55,167 --> 00:08:58,659
Simple, the rules for girls
are the same as the rules for Gremlins.

174
00:08:58,738 --> 00:09:00,399
- Gremlins?
- Gremlins.

175
00:09:00,473 --> 00:09:03,067
Rule number one, never get them wet.

176
00:09:03,142 --> 00:09:05,633
In other words, don't let her
take a shower at your place.

177
00:09:05,711 --> 00:09:08,043
Number two,
keep them away from sunlight,

178
00:09:08,114 --> 00:09:10,810
i.e. don't ever see them during the day.

179
00:09:10,883 --> 00:09:13,750
And rule number three,
never feed them after midnight,

180
00:09:13,819 --> 00:09:17,482
meaning she doesn't sleep over
and you don't have breakfast with her.

181
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:18,615
Ever.

182
00:09:19,025 --> 00:09:21,289
What about brunch? Is brunch cool?

183
00:09:22,762 --> 00:09:25,128
No, Ted, brunch is not cool.

184
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:29,232
Okay, new topic. How do I pick a tie?

185
00:09:29,302 --> 00:09:31,600
Simple.
Remember in the movie, <i>Predator...</i>

186
00:09:31,971 --> 00:09:35,338
I've done all three of those things
with Robin.

187
00:09:35,741 --> 00:09:37,333

Okay, seriously.
We're at the point of physical violence.

They still haven't had the talk, huh?

329
00:17:20,939 --> 00:17:24,033
I think I know how to speed things up.

Oh! Not cool!

333
00:17:32,418 --> 00:17:36,946
Pancakes, fresh bacon. It is so yummy.

334
00:17:38,157 --> 00:17:40,557
(EX CLAIMS) Dude, I'm starving. Let's...

335
00:17:40,626 --> 00:17:42,321
Let's just have the stupid talk.

336
00:17:42,394 --> 00:17:44,328
- Come on.
- (SIGHING) Fine.

337
00:17:45,030 --> 00:17:47,794

What do we say?

"Where do you see
this relationship going?"

00:17:56,008 --> 00:17:57,805
Oh, my God, that sounds so cheesy.

341
00:17:57,910 --> 00:18:00,606
- (LAUGHING) I know, right?
- (LAUGHING) Totally.

342
00:18:00,679 --> 00:18:02,112
But...

343
00:18:02,181 --> 00:18:04,411
Where do you see this relationship going?

344
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:07,347
I don't know.

345
00:18:08,253 --> 00:18:09,720
I mean, it's not like I don't like you.

346
00:18:09,788 --> 00:18:12,916
I just haven't had a girlfriend
for a long time.

347
00:18:13,492 --> 00:18:16,052
- I hope that doesn't make you mad.
- Mad?

348
00:18:16,128 --> 00:18:18,756
I feel the same way.
I suck at relationships.

349
00:18:18,964 --> 00:18:23,458
I mean, except with Ted. Man.
He really got it right.

350
00:18:23,535 --> 00:18:27,596
I know it's a clich?,
but he really ruined me for other men.

<i>Robin said something like that.</i>

353
00:18:33,846 --> 00:18:36,713
Maybe we should go back
to being just friends.

354
00:18:36,782 --> 00:18:38,147
Maybe.

355
00:18:39,118 --> 00:18:40,517
But...

356
00:18:40,586 --> 00:18:43,316
- I don't want to stop having sex.
- Oh, good. Me, neither.

357
00:18:45,324 --> 00:18:47,224
- Yeah, friends isn't gonna work.
- Nope.

358

We're not good at being friends.
We're not good at being

359
00:18:49,161 --> 00:18:50,856
in a relationship. What are we good at?

360
00:18:51,763 --> 00:18:53,731
- I know something we're good at.
- I don't know.

361
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:55,596
If we're gonna do it again,
I'm gonna need some Gatorade...

362
00:18:55,667 --> 00:18:57,726
No. No, not that.

363
00:18:58,337 --> 00:18:59,497
Lying. Think about it.

364
00:18:59,571 --> 00:19:01,630
We spent the whole summer lying
about being just friends.

365
00:19:01,707 --> 00:19:03,834
Why not just keep lying?

366
00:19:11,583 --> 00:19:13,414
- Really?
- Yeah. Really.

367
00:19:13,485 --> 00:19:16,318
We sat down. We had the talk.

368
00:19:16,388 --> 00:19:19,084
- Barney's my boyfriend now.
- And Robin's my girlfriend.

369
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:21,922
I know it sounds nuts,
but it feels good to say.

370
00:19:21,994 --> 00:19:23,791
We're both afraid of commitment,

371
00:19:23,862 --> 00:19:26,922
but the fact is,
we also can't live without each other.

372
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:28,523
And if the alternative is
not being together,

373
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:30,898
then it's worth taking this risk 'cause

374
00:19:32,638 --> 00:19:34,299
she's awesome.

375
00:19:34,373 --> 00:19:36,307
And he's awesome.

376
00:19:36,775 --> 00:19:39,903
- He looks nice in a suit.
- She can handle her scotch.

377
00:19:40,646 --> 00:19:43,809
- He's my boyfriend.
- And she's my girlfriend.
