00:00:01,466 --> 00:00:03,429
<i>Kids, everyone
has one or two moments</i>

2
00:00:03,554 --> 00:00:05,324
<i>when they make a huge,
crazy decision</i>

3
00:00:05,449 --> 00:00:07,150
<i>that changes their lives forever. </i>

4
00:00:07,275 --> 00:00:08,924
<i>This is the story of mine. </i>

5
00:00:09,109 --> 00:00:12,885
<i>It all started with a visit from my mom</i>
<i>and her longtime boyfriend, Clint,</i>

6
00:00:13,010 --> 00:00:14,993
<i>who was always saying stuff like... </i>

7
00:00:15,687 --> 00:00:19,491
your mother is a very,
very erotic woman.

8
00:00:19,978 --> 00:00:20,978
Please don't.

9
00:00:21,592 --> 00:00:24,065
As a painter, slash,
songwriter, slash,

10
00:00:24,511 --> 00:00:26,237
volunteer fear-fighter,

11
00:00:26,362 --> 00:00:27,463
I find her...

12
00:00:28,289 --> 00:00:30,001
incredibly sexual.

13
00:00:31,297 --> 00:00:33,057
But you have
your own sexual memories

14
00:00:33,182 --> 00:00:35,326
- with your mom, don't you?
- Please don't.

15
00:00:35,494 --> 00:00:38,746
Exiting her womb,
receiving her milk. You get me?

16
00:00:39,426 --> 00:00:40,164
Good.

17
00:00:43,484 --> 00:00:45,834
I cannot believe I am with that man.

18
00:00:46,094 --> 00:00:48,506
Mom. Mom, it's okay.
You don't have to settle.

19
00:00:48,674 --> 00:00:51,234
- There are plenty of guys who...
- He is so cool!

20
00:00:52,077 --> 00:00:53,697
And he picked me!

21
00:00:57,281 --> 00:00:59,702
Well, I'm... I'm glad
you're both so happy.

22
00:00:59,827 --> 00:01:02,769
Well, good, because we do
have an announcement...

23
00:01:04,198 --> 00:01:05,041
Son.

24
00:01:19,788 --> 00:01:21,539
<i>And so my mom was lapping me. </i>

25
00:01:21,707 --> 00:01:24,516
<i>Getting married for a second time
before I was even married once.</i>

26
00:01:24,641 --> 00:01:26,074
<i>I was so happy for them. </i>

27
00:01:26,371 --> 00:01:28,090
<i>So freakin' happy. </i>

28
00:01:28,714 --> 00:01:30,715
<i>Still, wedding can be magical. </i>

29
00:01:30,883 --> 00:01:34,108
<i>For all I knew, I end up sharing a dance
with my own future wife there. </i>

30
00:01:34,233 --> 00:01:36,789
And if you don't boil
those jam jars,

31
00:01:36,914 --> 00:01:39,765
it's just a welcome mat
for bacteria.

32
00:01:39,933 --> 00:01:41,476
<i>That wasn't her.</i>

33
00:01:43,317 --> 00:01:44,485
Congratulations!

34
00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:48,107
- We are so happy for you.
- I feel like I'm 19 again.

35
00:01:48,633 --> 00:01:51,610
It's like the last 35 years
of my life never happened.

36
00:01:51,914 --> 00:01:54,212
So wonderful to hear... Mom.

37
00:01:55,393 --> 00:01:59,509
Son, to show that your mom and I
will always be there for you,

38
00:02:00,303 --> 00:02:04,307
I want you to have this
beautiful picture that I painted.

39
00:02:06,173 --> 00:02:08,272
<i>Kids, there was no guitar. </i>

40
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:09,876
Excuse me, Ted.

41
00:02:10,898 --> 00:02:12,100
- Best...
- Wedding...

42
00:02:12,225 --> 00:02:13,625
- Eh...
- ... ver!

43
00:02:15,697 --> 00:02:16,802
Hello, everyone.

44
00:02:17,135 --> 00:02:19,109
Mahalo for being here with us.

45
00:02:20,530 --> 00:02:21,932
My entire life...

46
00:02:22,828 --> 00:02:24,128
Well, this life.

47
00:02:25,507 --> 00:02:28,230
I've waited for a muse
like Virginia.

48
00:02:29,447 --> 00:02:30,447
Baby...

49
00:02:31,695 --> 00:02:33,347
this is your song.

50
00:02:37,738 --> 00:02:41,285
<i>When I squeeze
her trembling bosom...</i>

51
00:02:41,453 --> 00:02:42,453
Oh, God...

52
00:02:42,746 --> 00:02:45,915
<i>The blood pumps to my loins</i>

53
00:02:46,631 --> 00:02:49,335
<i>When I penetrate her...</i>

54
00:02:49,503 --> 00:02:52,721
<i>Kids, I swear to God, I blacked
out for the next 12 minutes. </i>

55
00:02:52,846 --> 00:02:55,633
<i>So I have no idea
how the song got to this ending. </i>

56
00:02:55,911 --> 00:02:57,426
<i>And Mahatma Gandhi</i>

57
00:02:58,142 --> 00:02:59,678
<i>And the pancakes</i>

58
00:02:59,846 --> 00:03:02,473
Everyone!
<i>And the dragon</i>

59
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:05,761
<i>And you</i>

60
00:03:08,402 --> 00:03:09,823
<i>Virginia.</i>

61
00:03:11,491 --> 00:03:14,400
Guys! Guys!
Guess what Robin just did.

62
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:17,315
<i>Red and true...</i>

63
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:17,646

64
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:19,448
Are you crying?

65
00:03:20,445 --> 00:03:22,125
I know it's stupid, but...

66
00:03:22,406 --> 00:03:24,505
<i>And the dragon...</i>

67
00:03:26,507 --> 00:03:28,094
They're happy, you know?

68
00:03:29,990 --> 00:03:31,890
Not as happy as I am, Robin.

69
00:03:33,365 --> 00:03:34,505
Guys! Guys!

70
00:03:34,673 --> 00:03:36,048
Guess what Robin just did.

71
00:03:36,425 --> 00:03:39,875
And then, I told you guys
what Robin just did,

72
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,661
but you were there for that.

73
00:03:41,844 --> 00:03:43,472
I gotta tell
the rest of the wedding.

74
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:44,840
Aunt Meredith!

75
00:03:45,924 --> 00:03:48,018
<i>Kids, I can't overstate</i>

76
00:03:48,186 --> 00:03:50,227
<i>how horrible it is
to be the single guy</i>

77
00:03:50,352 --> 00:03:52,147
<i>at your own mother's</i>
<i>second wedding. </i>

78
00:03:52,315 --> 00:03:54,326
So, Ted, when's your wedding?

79
00:03:54,614 --> 00:03:56,318
So, Ted, when's your wedding?

80
00:03:56,486 --> 00:03:58,279
When's your wedding?
When's your wedding?

81
00:03:58,447 --> 00:03:59,530
When's your wedding?

82
00:03:59,698 --> 00:04:01,797
Robin cried at Clint's song.

83
00:04:02,436 --> 00:04:03,775
I told you already.

84
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:05,703
Ted's hot sister, Heather!

85
00:04:06,294 --> 00:04:08,394
- I have to leave.
- Wait, Ted.

86
00:04:08,749 --> 00:04:10,785
- What about your toast?
- Make up some emergency.

87
00:04:10,910 --> 00:04:12,376
I can't handle this.

88
00:04:12,966 --> 00:04:14,701
It's your mother's wedding!

89
00:04:14,826 --> 00:04:17,197
Uncle Larry, my hand to God...

90
00:04:17,412 --> 00:04:20,458
Niagara Falls.
This one. She's pouring.

91
00:04:20,706 --> 00:04:23,888
<i>And my friends didn't see me</i>
<i>for the next 72 hours. </i>

92
00:04:24,056 --> 00:04:25,306
Seriously, is Ted okay?

93
00:04:25,474 --> 00:04:27,847
I mean, I know
it was a rough weekend, but...

94
00:04:27,972 --> 00:04:30,227
- this radio silence is weird.
- I know.

95
00:04:30,395 --> 00:04:33,076
His mom's called, like, five times
asking where he disappeared to.

96
00:04:33,201 --> 00:04:35,691
Sorry, Robin.
They're all out of pretzels.

97
00:04:35,859 --> 00:04:38,286
And I know how emotional you get.

98
00:04:41,908 --> 00:04:42,908
Let it go.

99
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:44,560
Let it go.

100
00:04:45,197 --> 00:04:47,413
Okay, I...
I cried at Clint's song.

101
00:04:47,538 --> 00:04:48,913
She cried at Clint's song.

102
00:04:49,148 --> 00:04:50,197
Hey, guys.

103
00:04:50,322 --> 00:04:52,348
- Ted, where have you been?
- Are you okay?

104
00:04:52,473 --> 00:04:55,054
I'm better than okay.
I am on top of the world.

105
00:04:55,179 --> 00:04:56,754
Come on.
We're going for a ride!

106
00:04:59,359 --> 00:05:02,342
Hey, buddy, do you want to, maybe,
let somebody who isn't having

107
00:05:02,467 --> 00:05:04,341
some sort of manic episode
drive for a while?

108
00:05:04,466 --> 00:05:06,472
Yeah, and where the hell
are we going?

109
00:05:06,869 --> 00:05:09,934
First, let me tell you
what happened the night of the wedding.

110
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:11,760
<i>Watching my mom get married,</i>

111
00:05:11,885 --> 00:05:14,561
<i>I realized how far behind I was
in my own life. </i>

112
00:05:14,686 --> 00:05:16,315
I just had to get out of there.

113
00:05:16,483 --> 00:05:18,792
So I went back to my hotel room
<i>and got onto this Web site</i>

114
00:05:18,917 --> 00:05:20,861
<i>I sometimes visit
when I can't sleep... </i>

115
00:05:21,435 --> 00:05:22,988
Come on. Oh, God.

116
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:26,283
We do not want to know what you
and the Internet do when you're lonely.

117
00:05:26,451 --> 00:05:27,751
I didn't... I...

118
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:30,621
That's not the part of the night
I was talking about.

119
00:05:32,161 --> 00:05:34,313
<i>I went to my favorite
real estate auction site... </i>

120
00:05:34,438 --> 00:05:35,803
<i>Come on, we've all got one... </i>

121
00:05:35,928 --> 00:05:38,295
<i>Scrolled through
a few properties and... </i>

122
00:05:39,324 --> 00:05:40,324
Guys...

123
00:05:40,950 --> 00:05:43,092
I just bought my dream house.

124
00:05:48,566 --> 00:05:51,904
- What do you mean you bought this?
- I mean, I made a bid online.

125
00:05:52,029 --> 00:05:54,186
I won the auction the next day
and I got approval.

126
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:56,271
I just finalized the paperwork.

127
00:05:56,565 --> 00:05:58,977
And was the Blair Witch
easy to deal with

128
00:05:59,102 --> 00:06:01,211
or did she haggle
over the closing costs?

129
00:06:01,336 --> 00:06:03,070
Don't even joke about that, man.

130
00:06:03,652 --> 00:06:06,680
I think this room will be the study.
You know, a place just for Dad.

131
00:06:06,805 --> 00:06:10,035
The kids are welcome in here
if they're reading a book, but no toys.

132
00:06:10,203 --> 00:06:13,205
It's not a question of withholding love.
It's a question of drawing boundaries.

133
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:15,992
This is insane.

134
00:06:16,117 --> 00:06:17,672
This is gonna take years

135
00:06:17,797 --> 00:06:20,587
and a small fortune to make livable.

136
00:06:20,755 --> 00:06:22,584
I'm an architect.
I'll find a way.

137
00:06:22,709 --> 00:06:24,708
And if I start right now,
it'll be done by the time

138
00:06:24,833 --> 00:06:26,635
the ol' wifey and I
are ready to move in.

139
00:06:30,015 --> 00:06:32,474
Is she in the room
with us right now, Ted?

140
00:06:32,874 --> 00:06:36,144
Okay, okay, I know
I haven't found Mrs. Mosby yet,

141
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:38,147
but I will, knock on wood.

142
00:06:38,722 --> 00:06:39,972
Careful, buddy.

143
00:06:41,423 --> 00:06:44,966
You can't just skip ahead
to where you think your life should be.

144
00:06:45,091 --> 00:06:47,102
- It doesn't work that way.
- I've got to agree.

145
00:06:47,227 --> 00:06:49,158
This may be the stupidest thing
you've ever done.

146
00:06:49,326 --> 00:06:51,952
Stupidest thing any of us has
ever done. Okay, all right.

147
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,704
Let's lay off Ted, all right?

148
00:06:53,872 --> 00:06:56,742
We've all done some stupid things.
For example, I remember a time

149
00:06:56,867 --> 00:06:59,301
when I dropped some
bottle rockets in the toilet,

150
00:06:59,426 --> 00:07:02,463
and I tried to dry them
off in the microwave.

151
00:07:02,782 --> 00:07:04,425
You must have been
drunk off your ass.

152
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:07,908
No, too stupid to be an adult.
He was obviously a kid when it happened.

153
00:07:08,033 --> 00:07:09,261
A kid? How does a kid...

154
00:07:10,631 --> 00:07:11,878
Oh, my God. Guys!

155
00:07:12,003 --> 00:07:13,253
Great new game:

156
00:07:13,378 --> 00:07:16,602
"Drunk or Kid", which one was I?
Lock in your guesses.

157
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:18,037
- Drunk.
- Kid.

158
00:07:18,162 --> 00:07:19,188
Drumroll, please.

159
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:24,651
<i>I was... </i>

160
00:07:26,677 --> 00:07:27,801
<i>drunk!</i>

161
00:07:30,545 --> 00:07:32,749
You know,
I'm glad Robin got it right.

162
00:07:32,874 --> 00:07:35,204
'Cause she's very sensitive
and fragile.

163
00:07:36,769 --> 00:07:38,373
I'm referencing the time

164
00:07:38,541 --> 00:07:41,001
she cried at Clint's song.

165
00:07:41,446 --> 00:07:43,504
And even though I'm whispering,

166
00:07:43,672 --> 00:07:46,848
- I actually hope she hears me.
- It wasn't me!

167
00:07:47,092 --> 00:07:47,883
What?

168
00:07:48,136 --> 00:07:50,594
I'm not the one who cried
at Clint's song.

169
00:07:52,055 --> 00:07:53,723
<i>Red and true...</i>

170
00:07:54,975 --> 00:07:56,725
Are you crying?

171
00:07:57,621 --> 00:07:59,324
I know it's stupid, but...

172
00:07:59,555 --> 00:08:01,473
<i>And the dragon...</i>

173
00:08:03,237 --> 00:08:05,109
They're just happy, you know?

174
00:08:05,402 --> 00:08:07,617
Not as happy as I am.

175
00:08:08,071 --> 00:08:10,656
I will give you $500 if this just
happened to you instead of me.

176
00:08:11,014 --> 00:08:12,449
500 bucks? Deal.

177
00:08:14,622 --> 00:08:17,845
You just saved me unspeakable
public humiliation and shame.

178
00:08:18,456 --> 00:08:19,627
Guys! Guys!

179
00:08:20,437 --> 00:08:22,024
Guess what Robin just did.

180
00:08:23,397 --> 00:08:24,947
Wait, you guys are...

181
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:27,298
Hi, I'm here for the inspection.

182
00:08:27,461 --> 00:08:29,675
Oh, great! I was worried
you weren't coming.

183
00:08:29,843 --> 00:08:32,219
I'm here for a moment,
but I guess the doorbell doesn't work.

184
00:08:35,015 --> 00:08:37,724
Doorbell does not work.

185
00:08:40,171 --> 00:08:43,313
Wait, wait... you're just getting
this place inspected now?

186
00:08:48,365 --> 00:08:52,002
All right, let's all remember
that we've all done some stupid things.

187
00:08:52,127 --> 00:08:54,395
For example, I once
tried to ride my bike down

188
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:56,827
an extension ladder
from the roof of a two-story house.

189
00:08:58,271 --> 00:09:00,171
The only looming question is...

190
00:09:01,213 --> 00:09:02,734
was I drunk or a kid?

191
00:09:03,626 --> 00:09:04,784
- Drunk!
- Kid!

192
00:09:04,909 --> 00:09:06,259
Drumroll, please.

193
00:09:09,247 --> 00:09:10,371
<i>I was... </i>

194
00:09:10,496 --> 00:09:11,958
Marshall's dead!

195
00:09:12,437 --> 00:09:13,737
Marshall's dead!

196
00:09:14,371 --> 00:09:15,371
A kid.

197
00:09:18,454 --> 00:09:19,554
Moms, right?

198
00:09:19,679 --> 00:09:22,218
Just always making a big deal
out of nothing.

199
00:09:22,582 --> 00:09:24,438
I came out of that coma
in under a week.

200
00:09:25,278 --> 00:09:27,392
Let's check out the porch, huh?
Come on.

201
00:09:28,435 --> 00:09:31,116
I'm gonna put a grill out here.
Every Sunday, right here,

202
00:09:31,241 --> 00:09:32,946
it's gonna be a total sausage fest.

203
00:09:33,694 --> 00:09:34,938
Sausage party?

204
00:09:35,434 --> 00:09:37,005
Burgers, we'll do burgers.

205
00:09:37,494 --> 00:09:41,015
Stop it. You can't keep this house.
It's a huge mistake.

206
00:09:41,331 --> 00:09:42,481
Listen to me.

207
00:09:42,606 --> 00:09:44,981
I had a plan, okay?
Wife, house, kids.

208
00:09:45,106 --> 00:09:46,126
As it turns out,

209
00:09:46,251 --> 00:09:49,421
the universe is being kind of a wad
about the whole wife and kids part.

210
00:09:49,753 --> 00:09:52,603
So, what's the one thing I can control?
The house.

211
00:09:52,728 --> 00:09:54,885
I bought it.
It's not a huge mistake.

212
00:09:55,053 --> 00:09:59,057
Exactly. Me driving my brother's car
the wrong way down I-94,

213
00:09:59,696 --> 00:10:01,396
that was a huge mistake.

1
00:10:02,987 --> 00:10:04,038
- Drunk!
- Kid!

2
00:10:04,163 --> 00:10:05,173
I was...

3
00:10:07,924 --> 00:10:08,866
a kid.

4
00:10:15,573 --> 00:10:17,039
Did you cry on that guy?

5
00:10:17,726 --> 00:10:20,452
You got leaky pipes.
But the bright side:

6
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:24,354
the pond in your basement is drowning
some of the larger, slower rats.

7
00:10:24,479 --> 00:10:25,915
The rest of them, well...

8
00:10:26,603 --> 00:10:27,918
they're headed this way.

9
00:10:29,708 --> 00:10:30,462
See?

10
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:33,235
You should have waited to find out
the problems with this house.

11
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,436
You can always find problems
with any decision,

12
00:10:35,561 --> 00:10:37,883
but you can't let that stop you.
Freshman year,

13
00:10:38,008 --> 00:10:40,222
Marshall knew he wanted
to spend his life with you.

14
00:10:40,850 --> 00:10:43,517
What if someone had been there
to second-guess that decision?

15
00:10:48,842 --> 00:10:50,524
I know we've only been on two dates,

16
00:10:50,939 --> 00:10:52,369
but damn it, Lily Aldrin,

17
00:10:52,494 --> 00:10:54,319
- I'm going to marry you.
- Not so fast.

18
00:10:59,188 --> 00:11:01,380
We got some structural issues here.

19
00:11:01,828 --> 00:11:04,329
These hips are not
Eriksen baby-compliant.

20
00:11:04,918 --> 00:11:08,059
And this thing right here
does not have a proper filter.

21
00:11:08,418 --> 00:11:10,919
That's a maintenance issue
that's never going to go away.

22
00:11:11,087 --> 00:11:11,878
I know

23
00:11:12,046 --> 00:11:15,054
you think that you like
this gothic exterior now,

24
00:11:15,179 --> 00:11:16,250
but deep down

25
00:11:16,484 --> 00:11:19,177
didn't you always picture yourself
in something Spanish?

26
00:11:20,609 --> 00:11:22,883
I'd recommend you look
into the rental option.

27
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:27,602
But Marshall took that leap of faith,
it's the best thing that ever happened.

28
00:11:29,854 --> 00:11:31,495
It was Robin!

29
00:11:32,526 --> 00:11:33,452
"What?"

30
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:36,610
Yes, it was Robin
who cried at Clint's song!

31
00:11:36,772 --> 00:11:38,864
"But she said... "
I know what she said.

32
00:11:39,032 --> 00:11:40,907
Here's
what she didn't want you to know.

33
00:11:41,242 --> 00:11:43,229

34
00:11:41,813 --> 00:11:43,313
Listen, Barney,

35
00:11:43,805 --> 00:11:46,454
I can't stand all these jokes
about me crying.

36
00:11:46,899 --> 00:11:50,042
If I pretend to reveal that you were
the one who cried, will you go with it?

37
00:11:51,188 --> 00:11:51,938
Sure.

38
00:11:53,321 --> 00:11:55,699
I made a mistake letting you go,
didn't I?

39
00:11:57,516 --> 00:11:59,380
Your penis is enormous.

40
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:03,180
- You almost had us.
- You always take it one too far.

41
00:12:03,348 --> 00:12:04,357
Damn it!

42
00:12:05,274 --> 00:12:07,946
All right, good news.
I think we'll be out of here early.

43
00:12:08,071 --> 00:12:11,289
- Really?
- I finished downstairs and the outside.

44
00:12:11,414 --> 00:12:13,818
Now, I could keep looking
and see what else I can find

45
00:12:13,943 --> 00:12:15,225
besides the black mold,

46
00:12:15,350 --> 00:12:18,012
the damaged retaining wall,
the frayed electrical wires,

47
00:12:18,137 --> 00:12:21,073
the lead paint, the water damage,
the fire damage, the sun damage,

48
00:12:21,241 --> 00:12:23,241
the broken furnace,
the rotted floorboards...

49
00:12:23,507 --> 00:12:24,785
look...
no termites.

50
00:12:25,386 --> 00:12:27,245
The cracked chimney,
the bats, the rats,

51
00:12:27,413 --> 00:12:30,415
the spiders, the raccoons, the hobo,
the detached gutter,

52
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:33,811
the outdated fuse box and the paint job
in the kitchen, which is fine,

53
00:12:33,936 --> 00:12:36,421
but the trim really clashes
with the countertops.

54
00:12:36,788 --> 00:12:38,131
Or I could recommend

55
00:12:38,299 --> 00:12:41,585
that you do not buy this godforsaken
Guantanamo Bay of a house,

56
00:12:41,710 --> 00:12:43,925
and suggest
that we all get our asses out of here

57
00:12:44,050 --> 00:12:46,515
before a medium-sized wind blows
the whole sum'bitch down.

58
00:12:49,069 --> 00:12:50,159
What if...

59
00:12:50,452 --> 00:12:52,312
What if I already bought
the sum'bitch?

60
00:12:55,397 --> 00:12:57,389
I will check out the upstairs.

61
00:13:05,363 --> 00:13:07,109
Did he say he found a hobo?

62
00:13:09,254 --> 00:13:11,867
There are problems,
but I see this house

63
00:13:12,113 --> 00:13:13,792
for what I know it can be.

64
00:13:14,105 --> 00:13:16,308
I see a swing on that tree outside.

65
00:13:16,433 --> 00:13:18,630
I see a wreath on the front door
at Christmas.

66
00:13:19,167 --> 00:13:19,923
I see

67
00:13:20,091 --> 00:13:23,529
a grill out on that patio
where I'll be barbecuing every weekend.

68
00:13:24,751 --> 00:13:27,958
I see a life
that I know I can have here.

69
00:13:35,124 --> 00:13:36,460
I see a lawsuit.

70
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:38,991
Found termites.

71
00:13:45,645 --> 00:13:48,950
The good news is the inspector
killed some roaches on impact.

72
00:13:49,325 --> 00:13:50,325
Hold on.

73
00:13:51,243 --> 00:13:52,274
Giant hole

74
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:54,020
in second floor.

75
00:13:54,513 --> 00:13:56,710
Just wanted to make sure
the report is thorough.

76
00:13:59,447 --> 00:14:00,630
You were right.

77
00:14:01,181 --> 00:14:03,337
This was a huge mistake.
It's just...

78
00:14:04,462 --> 00:14:05,700
Everyone's moving on.

79
00:14:05,825 --> 00:14:09,055
You guys got a place years ago,
Robin's getting serious with Don.

80
00:14:10,725 --> 00:14:12,017
Maybe that's a new tie?

81
00:14:12,185 --> 00:14:13,516
Thank you! Jeez.

82
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:16,354
And now my mom's remarried.

83
00:14:17,313 --> 00:14:20,524
I'm exactly where I was five years ago.
I'm sick of it.

84
00:14:21,684 --> 00:14:24,362
I'm ready for the life
that fits into this house.

85
00:14:25,798 --> 00:14:27,122
It's all right, buddy.

86
00:14:28,259 --> 00:14:31,294
Sometimes people
make the wrong decisions in life.

87
00:14:32,658 --> 00:14:34,228
Like your mother.

88
00:14:35,410 --> 00:14:36,585
What you mean?

89
00:14:37,568 --> 00:14:40,322
As you know, I've always been very,

90
00:14:40,447 --> 00:14:42,255
very fond of your mother.

91
00:14:42,423 --> 00:14:43,924
- Please don't.
- In fact,

92
00:14:44,365 --> 00:14:46,463
Virginia and I
shared a special moment

93
00:14:46,588 --> 00:14:48,988
back in 2006 B.C...

94
00:14:49,961 --> 00:14:51,273
Before Clint.

95
00:14:51,974 --> 00:14:53,600
What are you talking about?

96
00:14:54,144 --> 00:14:55,984
I wanted to be your dad!

97
00:14:56,976 --> 00:14:59,564
- What does that even mean?
- Don't you talk back to me, young man!

98
00:14:59,842 --> 00:15:02,669
That's why I cried at Clint's song,

99
00:15:02,794 --> 00:15:05,266
because that bastard
took her away from me.

100
00:15:05,391 --> 00:15:06,399
And now,

101
00:15:06,615 --> 00:15:08,013
all I'm left with...

102
00:15:08,408 --> 00:15:11,590
is the memory
of dropping her off at the airport.

103
00:15:13,441 --> 00:15:15,597
And that's how you got the brooch?

104
00:15:15,925 --> 00:15:17,039
Unbelievable.

105
00:15:18,714 --> 00:15:19,593
You...

106
00:15:23,453 --> 00:15:24,422
Here we are.

107
00:15:26,149 --> 00:15:27,239
Here we are.

108
00:15:29,841 --> 00:15:32,173
- We made good time...
- Not a lot of traffic...

109
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:38,312
I love this song.

110
00:15:38,534 --> 00:15:39,847
Do you?
I can...

111
00:15:48,388 --> 00:15:49,390
Listen,

112
00:15:49,701 --> 00:15:50,824
Ted's mom...

113
00:15:51,771 --> 00:15:52,771
I...

114
00:15:53,380 --> 00:15:54,576
should really...

115
00:16:11,106 --> 00:16:13,087
Your penis is enormous.

116
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:16,708
Again?
Always one too far!

117
00:16:17,477 --> 00:16:20,422
Fine, that last part I made up,
but the rest of it, I swear it was true.

118
00:16:20,547 --> 00:16:22,647
Come on, dude.
Your mom is a cougar.

119
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:25,150
Wait, I thought you said
a cougar can't be over 50.

120
00:16:25,727 --> 00:16:27,192
She's a Mellencamp.

121
00:16:29,030 --> 00:16:31,548
I am screwed. The best I can do
is level this place

122
00:16:32,074 --> 00:16:34,071
and sell the property
for a huge loss.

123
00:16:36,072 --> 00:16:38,392
Usually in life when you make
a stupid decision,

124
00:16:38,517 --> 00:16:40,328
you just have to live with it.

125
00:16:40,453 --> 00:16:44,420
But how often do you get the chance
to pick up a sledgehammer

126
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:47,079
and bash the living hell out of it?

127
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:01,019
This is stupid.

128
00:17:01,187 --> 00:17:02,729
I got second base whit your mom.

129
00:17:26,838 --> 00:17:27,904
Thanks, Lily.

130
00:17:28,256 --> 00:17:29,506
That felt fantastic.

131
00:17:30,508 --> 00:17:32,338
To Ted Mosby...
homeowner,

132
00:17:32,677 --> 00:17:34,762
friend, and if he can rent it out,

133
00:17:34,985 --> 00:17:35,969
slumlord.

134
00:17:40,779 --> 00:17:41,717
There's...

135
00:17:42,690 --> 00:17:44,521
There's one last thing
I've got to do.

136
00:17:45,010 --> 00:17:48,115
<i>And my friends didn't see me
for the next 72 hours.</i>

137
00:17:49,334 --> 00:17:50,552
He was our ride.

138
00:17:58,995 --> 00:18:01,204
Ted, what are you doing here?

139
00:18:01,691 --> 00:18:03,498
I never got to give you your toast.

140
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:07,676
I was selfish and I freaked out
and I'm so sorry, so...

141
00:18:08,394 --> 00:18:09,462
here it is.

142
00:18:11,674 --> 00:18:14,481
"How bout a hand for the deejay?
Gesture to dee... "

143
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:16,720
I'll skip down.

144
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:19,366
"Mom, I love you,

145
00:18:20,128 --> 00:18:22,741
"and I've never seen you
as happy as you are with Clint.

146
00:18:23,386 --> 00:18:25,589
"And, Clint, welcome to the family.

147
00:18:27,231 --> 00:18:29,972
"What you two have
is what I one day hope to find.

148
00:18:31,536 --> 00:18:33,692
But until then, cheers to you both."

149
00:18:34,524 --> 00:18:35,780
I love you, guys.

150
00:18:40,453 --> 00:18:41,590
I am so...

151
00:18:43,851 --> 00:18:45,351
baked right now.

152
00:18:47,168 --> 00:18:50,285
I'm only 60% sure
you're actually standing in front of me.

153
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:51,832
But if you are,

154
00:18:53,063 --> 00:18:54,070
I love you.

155
00:18:55,629 --> 00:18:58,386
And you are the best son
a mother could ever have.

156
00:19:11,659 --> 00:19:15,034
<i>There was no logical reason why
my mom should be with a guy like that.</i>

157
00:19:15,362 --> 00:19:16,909
<i>And yet, as you kids know,</i>

158
00:19:17,034 --> 00:19:19,190
<i>being with your Grampa Clint
was the best decision</i>

159
00:19:19,315 --> 00:19:20,829
<i>your grandma ever made.</i>

160
00:19:25,283 --> 00:19:26,688
<i>Sometimes our best decisions</i>

161
00:19:26,813 --> 00:19:28,833
<i>are the ones
that don't make any sense at all.</i>

162
00:19:40,109 --> 00:19:42,086
How'd you know
I was going to be here?

163
00:19:42,211 --> 00:19:43,249
Robin told me.

164
00:19:45,324 --> 00:19:46,643
Happy housewarming.

165
00:19:47,808 --> 00:19:51,055
But, I told you the last time I saw you
I'm selling the place.

166
00:19:51,757 --> 00:19:52,941
I know what you said.

167
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:56,878
I also know my best friend,
Ted Mosby.

168
00:19:57,546 --> 00:19:58,554
Look...

169
00:19:59,031 --> 00:20:01,936
of all the times over the years
when I've said to you,

170
00:20:02,853 --> 00:20:05,057
"Slow down.
Don't rush into things with this girl"

171
00:20:05,182 --> 00:20:07,163
You haven't listened to me
a single time.

172
00:20:09,861 --> 00:20:12,100
Your heart is both drunk and a kid.

173
00:20:17,683 --> 00:20:20,620
- Thanks for sticking up for me.
- That's what I do.

174
00:20:23,901 --> 00:20:26,432
Can I show you
some of the ideas I have?

175
00:20:28,881 --> 00:20:30,897
<i>And, kids, Marshall was right.</i>

176
00:20:31,236 --> 00:20:33,006
<i>I didn't give up on my dream house</i>

177
00:20:33,131 --> 00:20:35,420
<i>because that's the thing
about stupid decisions:</i>

178
00:20:35,643 --> 00:20:36,791
<i>we all make them.</i>

179
00:20:37,014 --> 00:20:38,455
<i>But time is funny.</i>

180
00:20:41,801 --> 00:20:43,652
<i>And sometimes a little magical...</i>

181
00:20:45,797 --> 00:20:47,719
<i>It can take a stupid decision...</i>

182
00:20:48,914 --> 00:20:51,352
<i>and turn it
into something else entirely.</i>

183
00:20:52,359 --> 00:20:53,496
<i>Because, kids,</i>

184
00:20:53,859 --> 00:20:54,973
<i>as you know...</i>

185
00:20:56,125 --> 00:20:57,262
<i>that house</i>
