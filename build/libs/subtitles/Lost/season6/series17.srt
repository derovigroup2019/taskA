1
00:00:00,311 --> 00:00:02,967
This island's goin' down!
Linus, come in!

2
00:00:04,565 --> 00:00:06,018
Linus, come in!

3
00:00:10,492 --> 00:00:11,849
Linus, come in!

4
00:00:13,062 --> 00:00:13,987
Come in!

5
00:00:15,008 --> 00:00:16,660
Miles, is that you?

6
00:00:16,694 --> 00:00:18,580
Yeah. What--what the hell
is happening?

7
00:00:19,012 --> 00:00:20,453
Are you with Claire?

8
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:22,732
She's here, but
she doesn't want to come with us.

9
00:00:22,767 --> 00:00:24,012
Come with you where?

10
00:00:24,253 --> 00:00:26,403
Lapidus is working on the plane
right now.

11
00:00:26,437 --> 00:00:27,641
Then we're taking off.

12
00:00:36,213 --> 00:00:39,115
Hey, how much longer till
we get this thing in the air?

13
00:00:39,150 --> 00:00:42,338
I still have to check the electrical 
and the hydraulics!

14
00:00:42,796 --> 00:00:46,523
<i>- Five hours, maybe six.
- You've got maybe one!</i>

15
00:00:46,557 --> 00:00:49,192
Get your asses over here!
We're leaving in an hour!

16
00:00:50,381 --> 00:00:51,726
Son of a bitch!

17
00:00:51,846 --> 00:00:54,065
How the hell are we supposed
to get over there?!

18
00:00:54,185 --> 00:00:56,168
I know how we can get there!

19
00:00:58,069 --> 00:00:59,755
Locke has a boat!

20
00:01:14,485 --> 00:01:16,369
<i>Locke!</i>

21
00:03:00,445 --> 00:03:02,166
I want you to know, Jack...

22
00:03:03,382 --> 00:03:05,595
<i>You died for nothing.</i>

23
00:03:09,187 --> 00:03:12,423
Aah! Uhh!

24
00:03:13,406 --> 00:03:14,883
I saved you a bullet!

25
00:03:32,849 --> 00:03:34,291
You're too late.

26
00:04:00,977 --> 00:04:02,779
Nice work, Dr. Shephard.

27
00:04:07,872 --> 00:04:09,280
What happened to your neck?

28
00:04:12,651 --> 00:04:13,816
Damn it.

29
00:04:19,391 --> 00:04:21,725
Okay, he's stable.
I'm gonna hop in the shower

30
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:24,218
And see if I can catch up with
David before the concert's over.

31
00:04:24,338 --> 00:04:25,960
So just give me a call
if you need me.

32
00:04:25,994 --> 00:04:29,781
Dr. Shephard?
He's waking up.

33
00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:33,905
I watched the anesthesiologist.
He got the full dosage.

34
00:04:35,279 --> 00:04:36,173
Okay.

35
00:04:36,636 --> 00:04:37,633
I'll take it from here.

36
00:04:39,945 --> 00:04:41,009
Mr. Locke?

37
00:04:41,279 --> 00:04:42,313
Can you hear me?

38
00:04:44,871 --> 00:04:46,117
John, are you awake?

39
00:04:49,354 --> 00:04:50,888
You just had major surgery,

40
00:04:50,922 --> 00:04:53,390
So I need you
to try not to move

41
00:04:53,425 --> 00:04:55,640
And just relax, okay?

42
00:04:57,031 --> 00:04:58,328
It worked.

43
00:04:58,730 --> 00:05:00,364
Well, it went well.

44
00:05:00,398 --> 00:05:03,015
But we won't know how well you
responded to the surgery for--

45
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:04,845
No, Dr. Shephard. It worked.

46
00:05:07,355 --> 00:05:08,941
I can feel my legs.

47
00:05:10,719 --> 00:05:12,720
John, it's highly unlikely

48
00:05:12,731 --> 00:05:14,659
That you would regain sensation
that quickly.

49
00:05:14,681 --> 00:05:15,763
So let's just take it s--

50
00:05:20,254 --> 00:05:21,185
Ooh.

51
00:05:29,934 --> 00:05:31,061
Oh!

52
00:05:39,070 --> 00:05:40,670
?

53
00:05:44,528 --> 00:05:45,276
Ohh.

54
00:05:47,112 --> 00:05:49,481
- Did you see that?
- See what?

55
00:05:56,706 --> 00:05:58,522
You don't remember?

56
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:02,934
Um...

57
00:06:03,763 --> 00:06:04,895
Mr. Locke,

58
00:06:05,212 --> 00:06:07,445
Please, just, uh, just relax.

59
00:06:07,483 --> 00:06:09,723
What we need to do--
what we need to do is go.

60
00:06:09,843 --> 00:06:11,489
No, no, no. Hey, John.

61
00:06:12,041 --> 00:06:15,105
- Will you come with me?
- We're not going anywhere.

62
00:06:15,561 --> 00:06:17,675
You just had extensive
spinal surgery...

63
00:06:17,709 --> 00:06:20,168
and I-I need
to go see my son.

64
00:06:21,112 --> 00:06:22,713
You don't have a son.

65
00:06:25,456 --> 00:06:26,141
What?

66
00:06:27,102 --> 00:06:28,844
You don't have a son, Jack.

67
00:06:30,909 --> 00:06:31,922
Doctor?

68
00:06:33,251 --> 00:06:34,453
Jane, um...

69
00:06:35,177 --> 00:06:37,532
Would you give Mr. Locke
something to help him rest?

70
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:38,408
I need to go.

71
00:06:38,449 --> 00:06:39,496
Jack.

72
00:06:42,714 --> 00:06:46,024
I hope that somebody does
for you

73
00:06:46,492 --> 00:06:48,402
What you just did for me.

74
00:07:15,579 --> 00:07:17,945
Oh. Oh, my God.

75
00:07:20,217 --> 00:07:21,938
Oh!

76
00:07:22,830 --> 00:07:25,005
- Ohh. Jack.
- I'll be fine.

77
00:07:26,109 --> 00:07:28,713
Just find me some thread,
and I can count to five.

78
00:07:30,467 --> 00:07:31,339
Hey!

79
00:07:33,217 --> 00:07:34,818
Oh, my God!

80
00:07:35,113 --> 00:07:36,543
What the hell happened?

81
00:07:37,355 --> 00:07:38,650
Locke's dead.

82
00:07:40,235 --> 00:07:41,112
It's over.

83
00:07:54,794 --> 00:07:56,367
It sure don't feel like it's over.

84
00:08:05,145 --> 00:08:06,670
Excuse me. Ms. Paik?

85
00:08:07,463 --> 00:08:08,448
Yes?

86
00:08:10,021 --> 00:08:10,975
Hi.

87
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:14,338
I'm Detective Ford. L.A.P.D.

88
00:08:14,662 --> 00:08:16,524
I'm sorry.
I heard you were shot,

89
00:08:16,644 --> 00:08:18,818
But I didn't expect you
to be checking out so soon.

90
00:08:21,332 --> 00:08:22,157
Hey.

91
00:08:22,277 --> 00:08:24,523
Hello... Detective.

92
00:08:26,049 --> 00:08:29,088
Well, I came by to check
if you've seen this man.

93
00:08:29,551 --> 00:08:32,265
He escaped custody, and we're
worried he might come after you.

94
00:08:32,385 --> 00:08:34,319
I'm gonna assign a uniform
to keep an eye on you

95
00:08:34,439 --> 00:08:36,319
- Until we can ap--
- You don't have to do that.

96
00:08:39,405 --> 00:08:41,796
All due respect, I have a job 
to do here, ma'am.

97
00:08:42,417 --> 00:08:45,816
<i>- I need to keep you safe.
- It's okay. I am safe.</i>

98
00:08:50,264 --> 00:08:51,273
We'll see you there.

99
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:56,118
<i>See me where?</i>

100
00:09:00,229 --> 00:09:01,538
Alright.

101
00:09:01,572 --> 00:09:03,340
It ain't pretty, but it's gonna work.

102
00:09:04,037 --> 00:09:06,007
I've gotta reset
the electronics.

103
00:09:15,693 --> 00:09:18,054
Something's wrong with the hydraulics
down in the nose wheel.

104
00:09:18,174 --> 00:09:19,804
Is either one of you guys
mechanical? 

105
00:09:20,570 --> 00:09:21,483
Yeah?

106
00:09:21,603 --> 00:09:24,018
I-I worked for a-a contractor
renovating apartments

107
00:09:24,138 --> 00:09:25,868
- For a couple summers.
- Here, take that...

108
00:09:26,528 --> 00:09:28,698
And this... And this.

109
00:09:28,733 --> 00:09:30,730
Go down there, make sure
everything's hooked up right.

110
00:09:31,451 --> 00:09:32,535
Go!

111
00:09:34,214 --> 00:09:36,906
- Lapidus?
- Yeah?

112
00:09:36,941 --> 00:09:38,988
Frank, how's it going over
there? What's your timetable?

113
00:09:39,018 --> 00:09:40,079
Don't bother me!

114
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:43,805
Sounds like
they're making progress.

115
00:09:54,355 --> 00:09:56,860
<i>- We gotta go now.</i>
- I don't understand.

116
00:09:57,309 --> 00:10:00,421
Locke's dead.
Why is this still happening?

117
00:10:00,541 --> 00:10:02,259
Because whatever Desmond
turned off,

118
00:10:03,905 --> 00:10:05,850
I need to
turn it back on again.

119
00:10:06,319 --> 00:10:08,361
But if it doesn't work--
if I don't get it done--

120
00:10:08,638 --> 00:10:11,201
You all need to leave now.
You need to be on that plane.

121
00:10:12,822 --> 00:10:16,279
You can come with us, too, Jack.
You don't have to do this.

122
00:10:16,802 --> 00:10:17,919
<i>No, I do have to do it.</i>

123
00:10:18,039 --> 00:10:19,604
<i>No, you don't.</i>

124
00:10:21,719 --> 00:10:23,653
Let this island sink, Jack.

125
00:10:23,688 --> 00:10:25,458
Kate, I can't.

126
00:10:33,468 --> 00:10:35,799
You think you can get that boat across
the channel in time? 

127
00:10:36,183 --> 00:10:37,180
Yeah, I can manage.

128
00:10:45,543 --> 00:10:47,069
Good luck to you, James.

129
00:10:47,778 --> 00:10:50,466
Thanks, doc, for everything.

130
00:10:54,577 --> 00:10:55,802
James!

131
00:10:58,565 --> 00:11:00,967
If the island's going down,
I'm going down with it.

132
00:11:03,994 --> 00:11:06,583
Hugo. You better get going.

133
00:11:06,703 --> 00:11:08,661
<i>Unh-unh. No way.
You think I'm going down that?</i>

134
00:11:09,190 --> 00:11:10,321
I'm with you, dude.

135
00:11:11,847 --> 00:11:13,069
Okay.

136
00:11:15,873 --> 00:11:16,628
Kate...

137
00:11:18,033 --> 00:11:19,090
You gotta go.

138
00:11:20,435 --> 00:11:22,197
Get Claire on that plane.

139
00:11:30,686 --> 00:11:32,584
Tell me
I'm gonna see you again.

140
00:11:59,765 --> 00:12:00,834
I love you.

141
00:12:05,159 --> 00:12:06,333
I love you.

142
00:12:41,733 --> 00:12:42,696
Can you fix it?

143
00:12:43,032 --> 00:12:44,603
I don't believe
in a lot of things,

144
00:12:44,637 --> 00:12:46,776
But I do believe in duct tape.

145
00:12:47,461 --> 00:12:48,640
Yeah, I think we're good.

146
00:12:51,113 --> 00:12:53,407
Let's get the hell out of here.

147
00:12:56,014 --> 00:12:57,863
Yo, chesty.
It's Sawyer and Kate.

148
00:12:59,361 --> 00:13:00,647
Yeah?

149
00:13:00,767 --> 00:13:01,876
We're on our way
down to the sailboat,

150
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:04,115
<i>Then we're heading to you.
Don't leave without us!</i>

151
00:13:05,602 --> 00:13:06,839
We're gettin' off the ground

152
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:08,161
While there's still ground
to get off.

153
00:13:08,281 --> 00:13:10,455
So if you wanna go, you better
get your asses in gear.

154
00:13:11,644 --> 00:13:13,279
Lapidus! Lapidus!

155
00:13:14,087 --> 00:13:16,718
- Son of a bitch!
- What now?

156
00:13:21,874 --> 00:13:23,040
We jump.

157
00:13:32,685 --> 00:13:35,653
- I'll see you at the boat.
- Kate!

158
00:13:57,659 --> 00:13:59,941
Hey, you know where I can get
some grub around here?

159
00:14:01,214 --> 00:14:03,162
Uh, the cafeteria's closed,

160
00:14:03,206 --> 00:14:04,872
But there's a vending machine
down the hallway.

161
00:14:07,008 --> 00:14:07,957
Thanks, doc.

162
00:14:09,146 --> 00:14:09,867
Yeah, no problem.

163
00:14:32,894 --> 00:14:33,867
Oh, come on.

164
00:14:38,153 --> 00:14:39,462
Unbelievable.

165
00:14:52,222 --> 00:14:53,159
Can I help you?

166
00:14:55,237 --> 00:14:56,919
It's okay. I'm a...

167
00:14:57,819 --> 00:14:58,741
I'm a cop.

168
00:14:59,534 --> 00:15:01,300
Mm. Maybe you should
read the machine its rights.

169
00:15:04,710 --> 00:15:06,344
- That's funny.
- Mm.

170
00:15:06,378 --> 00:15:08,794
- Can I tell you a secret?
- Please.

171
00:15:09,178 --> 00:15:12,664
If you unplug it, and then
you plug it back in again,

172
00:15:12,784 --> 00:15:14,411
The candy
just drops right down.

173
00:15:14,987 --> 00:15:16,654
Is that right?

174
00:15:16,688 --> 00:15:18,363
Yes,
and it's technically legal.

175
00:15:18,857 --> 00:15:19,920
Oh.

176
00:15:22,346 --> 00:15:23,995
I'll give that a shot.

177
00:15:33,405 --> 00:15:34,265
Oops.

178
00:15:38,677 --> 00:15:39,578
It worked.

179
00:15:44,816 --> 00:15:45,852
Oh.

180
00:15:46,261 --> 00:15:47,642
Whoa.

181
00:15:49,155 --> 00:15:50,488
Did you feel that?

182
00:15:55,746 --> 00:15:57,703
- We should get coffee sometime.
- I'd love to,

183
00:15:57,823 --> 00:15:59,866
But that machine ate my dollar.
I only got one left.

184
00:16:00,863 --> 00:16:02,248
We could go dutch.

185
00:16:07,572 --> 00:16:11,108
?

186
00:16:16,948 --> 00:16:19,317
?

187
00:16:22,854 --> 00:16:24,188
Juliet.

188
00:16:26,803 --> 00:16:28,725
Juliet, it's--it's me.

189
00:16:34,341 --> 00:16:35,806
Julie.

190
00:16:41,882 --> 00:16:43,384
It's me, baby.

191
00:16:49,203 --> 00:16:50,681
I got you.

192
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:53,534
I got you, baby.

193
00:16:58,691 --> 00:17:00,817
Yeah.

194
00:17:02,667 --> 00:17:04,396
Kiss me, James.

195
00:17:05,030 --> 00:17:06,585
You got it, Blondie.

196
00:17:41,548 --> 00:17:42,665
It's over.

197
00:17:43,674 --> 00:17:44,719
Excuse me?

198
00:17:45,998 --> 00:17:46,915
The concert.

199
00:17:47,367 --> 00:17:48,628
It's over.

200
00:17:50,803 --> 00:17:52,111
You looking for someone?

201
00:17:55,059 --> 00:17:56,424
Yeah. My son.

202
00:17:56,813 --> 00:17:58,893
I was supposed to bring him here 
tonight and then...

203
00:17:58,928 --> 00:18:00,181
I couldn't come, and...

204
00:18:07,370 --> 00:18:09,037
I'm sorry.

205
00:18:11,488 --> 00:18:13,208
Where do I remember you from?

206
00:18:14,564 --> 00:18:15,910
I stole your pen.

207
00:18:17,299 --> 00:18:18,115
What?

208
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:19,881
Um...

209
00:18:20,374 --> 00:18:22,007
Oceanic 815.

210
00:18:23,419 --> 00:18:24,719
From Sydney.

211
00:18:24,754 --> 00:18:26,898
I bumped into you
coming out of the bathroom,

212
00:18:27,426 --> 00:18:28,736
And... I stole your pen.

213
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:30,725
And that's how I know you?

214
00:18:33,284 --> 00:18:34,305
No.

215
00:18:35,326 --> 00:18:36,430
That's not how you know me.

216
00:18:53,155 --> 00:18:55,125
I missed you so much.

217
00:19:03,284 --> 00:19:04,245
Are you okay?

218
00:19:05,928 --> 00:19:07,608
What is happening to me?

219
00:19:09,265 --> 00:19:10,542
Who...

220
00:19:12,068 --> 00:19:13,435
Who are you? I don't...

221
00:19:13,555 --> 00:19:15,371
I know you don't understand,
Jack.

222
00:19:19,430 --> 00:19:20,944
But if you come with me,

223
00:19:22,278 --> 00:19:24,045
You will.

224
00:19:38,327 --> 00:19:39,933
It's over there.

225
00:19:54,446 --> 00:19:55,816
How we gettin' down there?

226
00:19:57,161 --> 00:19:59,914
We're not. I'm going alone.

227
00:20:00,177 --> 00:20:01,714
Dude, you can't go down there alone. 

228
00:20:02,039 --> 00:20:03,993
Desmond didn't make it.
<i>How the hell are you gonna survive?</i>

229
00:20:16,765 --> 00:20:18,017
No.

230
00:20:21,837 --> 00:20:23,705
No way.
I'm not gonna let you die.

231
00:20:23,954 --> 00:20:27,101
Hurley, I'm already dead.

232
00:20:27,354 --> 00:20:29,644
- You said you'd protect the island!
- And that's what I'm doing.

233
00:20:29,678 --> 00:20:32,644
- You're committing suicide! 
- I'm not. This is the way it has to happen.

234
00:20:33,065 --> 00:20:34,539
<i>This is what
I'm supposed to do.</i>

235
00:20:34,567 --> 00:20:37,353
<i>You're not supposed to die!
The island needs you!</i>

236
00:20:37,593 --> 00:20:39,106
Hurley...

237
00:20:41,428 --> 00:20:42,533
<i>It needs you.</i>

238
00:20:44,515 --> 00:20:45,368
What?

239
00:20:46,413 --> 00:20:48,263
It needs to be you, Hugo.

240
00:20:54,867 --> 00:20:56,070
I can't.

241
00:20:58,134 --> 00:20:59,541
<i>It's supposed to be you.</i>

242
00:20:59,575 --> 00:21:02,143
It was only supposed to be me
so I could do this.

243
00:21:02,815 --> 00:21:04,665
But if someone has to
take care of the island,

244
00:21:04,785 --> 00:21:08,264
If someone has to protect it,
then... Then it should be you.

245
00:21:09,211 --> 00:21:10,172
Hurley...

246
00:21:11,974 --> 00:21:13,151
I believe in you.

247
00:21:19,196 --> 00:21:20,709
Alright, I'll take it.

248
00:21:22,131 --> 00:21:23,443
But it's only temporary.

249
00:21:23,563 --> 00:21:25,822
As soon as you get that light
back on, I'm pulling you up,

250
00:21:25,942 --> 00:21:27,859
And I'm giving it right 
back to you. Deal? 

251
00:21:28,411 --> 00:21:29,456
Deal.

252
00:21:36,348 --> 00:21:37,573
Do you have anything to drink?

253
00:21:39,081 --> 00:21:40,847
Anything to drink out of?

254
00:21:41,304 --> 00:21:43,033
- A-a cup. A canteen.
- I do.

255
00:21:46,722 --> 00:21:48,117
Is that okay?

256
00:21:48,526 --> 00:21:50,244
Perfect.

257
00:22:04,984 --> 00:22:06,207
Drink this.

258
00:22:29,832 --> 00:22:31,337
Is that it?

259
00:22:37,211 --> 00:22:38,580
Now you're like me.

260
00:22:50,966 --> 00:22:52,227
Second time's a charm.

261
00:22:52,684 --> 00:22:55,889
It better be, 'cause we sure as hell don't 
have the battery power for a third time.

262
00:23:05,034 --> 00:23:06,203
Is that good?

263
00:23:06,323 --> 00:23:08,185
That, my friends,
is pure music.

264
00:23:14,009 --> 00:23:15,194
Easy.

265
00:23:22,591 --> 00:23:24,852
Easy. Easy.

266
00:23:32,695 --> 00:23:33,925
Dude!

267
00:24:02,593 --> 00:24:03,878
Desmond!

268
00:24:05,115 --> 00:24:06,280
Desmond!

269
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,449
Can you hear me?

270
00:24:10,232 --> 00:24:12,615
Aah! Ah!

271
00:24:12,937 --> 00:24:14,019
The light...

272
00:24:14,907 --> 00:24:16,248
I put it out.

273
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:18,072
It didn't work.

274
00:24:20,493 --> 00:24:22,235
I thought I'd leave this place.

275
00:24:23,712 --> 00:24:24,919
I got you. Come on.

276
00:24:25,784 --> 00:24:27,562
Come on.
Ah!

277
00:24:31,653 --> 00:24:33,654
I'm still here.

278
00:24:35,157 --> 00:24:36,304
You were right, Jack.

279
00:24:36,424 --> 00:24:39,060
Yeah, well, there's a first time
for everything.

280
00:24:39,714 --> 00:24:41,432
Aah!

281
00:24:42,231 --> 00:24:43,691
Uhh! I have to put it back.

282
00:24:44,627 --> 00:24:46,734
- It was like a drain.
- That's what you did?

283
00:24:46,769 --> 00:24:48,497
You took that stone out of that hole 
over there?

284
00:24:48,809 --> 00:24:50,185
Jack, you can't. Listen.

285
00:24:50,305 --> 00:24:52,467
Even if you turn it back on,
it'll kill ya. It has to be me.

286
00:24:52,498 --> 00:24:53,956
Desmond, you've done enough.

287
00:24:54,716 --> 00:24:57,227
You wanna do something? Go home
and be with your wife and son.

288
00:24:58,512 --> 00:25:00,025
<i>How about you, Jack?</i>

289
00:25:02,217 --> 00:25:04,027
I'll see you in another life,
brother.

290
00:25:15,394 --> 00:25:16,898
Claire?

291
00:25:31,817 --> 00:25:33,727
Oh, that ain't good.

292
00:25:33,982 --> 00:25:37,083
Miles, go look out the door! You're gonna
be my eyes while I back this out of here. 

293
00:25:37,203 --> 00:25:38,847
Richard, go tell me what he says.

294
00:25:39,555 --> 00:25:40,855
Claire!

295
00:25:46,064 --> 00:25:47,195
Are you okay?

296
00:26:05,948 --> 00:26:08,382
Come on! We gotta go!
Come on!

297
00:26:08,973 --> 00:26:10,685
- Claire, come on, please.
- I can't!

298
00:26:10,719 --> 00:26:12,553
- Why?!
- Look at me!

299
00:26:14,189 --> 00:26:15,843
This island's made me crazy.

300
00:26:15,871 --> 00:26:17,658
I-I don't want Aaron
to see me like this.

301
00:26:19,228 --> 00:26:21,645
I don't--I don't even know
how to be a mother anymore.

302
00:26:21,765 --> 00:26:23,074
Listen to me.
None of us do.

303
00:26:24,433 --> 00:26:25,616
Not at first.

304
00:26:26,205 --> 00:26:27,394
But you're not alone.

305
00:26:30,073 --> 00:26:31,410
Let me help you.

306
00:26:37,675 --> 00:26:38,479
Now come on.

307
00:26:40,306 --> 00:26:41,415
Let's go.

308
00:26:46,154 --> 00:26:48,589
- Are we clear?!
- Miles, are we clear?

309
00:26:48,624 --> 00:26:51,058
- Yeah, it looks like it to me!
- He says we're good.

310
00:26:51,093 --> 00:26:53,754
You better pray we are, Ricky boy, 
'cause I'm gonna spin her around. 

311
00:26:53,874 --> 00:26:55,412
Hold on!

312
00:26:58,394 --> 00:27:01,746
Sawyer! Tell him to stop! 
Tell him we're coming! 

313
00:27:01,866 --> 00:27:03,283
Lapidus! Lapidus!

314
00:27:03,403 --> 00:27:04,749
Lapidus, hold on!

315
00:27:06,008 --> 00:27:07,707
All right, we're good to go!

316
00:27:10,014 --> 00:27:11,112
Let's go!

317
00:27:28,576 --> 00:27:30,185
What the hell?

318
00:27:35,660 --> 00:27:38,205
Boys, we got some late arrivals.
Open the door.

319
00:27:40,802 --> 00:27:41,976
Come on!

320
00:28:50,212 --> 00:28:51,850
We're running out of time!

321
00:28:57,519 --> 00:29:00,554
- Way to wait till the last second, Jim.
- Good to see you, too, Enos.

322
00:29:00,589 --> 00:29:01,616
We got 'em!

323
00:29:01,736 --> 00:29:03,334
Everybody, buckle up tight!

324
00:29:04,192 --> 00:29:05,292
Hold on!

325
00:29:14,036 --> 00:29:15,431
Here we go, Frank.

326
00:29:42,631 --> 00:29:43,698
Come on.

327
00:29:46,447 --> 00:29:48,116
<i>Come on.</i>

328
00:30:03,485 --> 00:30:04,752
Amen.

329
00:31:22,130 --> 00:31:24,659
He did it.
The light's back on.

330
00:31:24,779 --> 00:31:26,100
Dude, pull.

331
00:31:30,338 --> 00:31:32,973
Hang on, Jack!

332
00:31:44,701 --> 00:31:45,519
Got him!

333
00:31:47,589 --> 00:31:48,722
Desmond?

334
00:31:49,189 --> 00:31:50,090
No.

335
00:31:51,111 --> 00:31:52,126
Jack!

336
00:31:59,501 --> 00:32:01,546
<i>Jack!</i>

337
00:32:37,471 --> 00:32:38,612
Thank you.

338
00:32:58,339 --> 00:32:59,504
Hello, Benjamin.

339
00:33:02,363 --> 00:33:03,288
Hello, John.

340
00:33:06,156 --> 00:33:07,886
Is everyone already inside?

341
00:33:09,664 --> 00:33:11,321
I believe
most of them are, yes.

342
00:33:15,267 --> 00:33:16,581
Mm.

343
00:33:16,937 --> 00:33:18,943
I'm very sorry
for what I did to you, John.

344
00:33:22,661 --> 00:33:23,802
I was selfish

345
00:33:24,066 --> 00:33:25,700
And jealous.

346
00:33:26,805 --> 00:33:28,342
<i>I wanted everything you had.</i>

347
00:33:32,349 --> 00:33:33,683
What did I have?

348
00:33:35,929 --> 00:33:37,563
You were special, John.

349
00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:40,981
And I wasn't.

350
00:33:45,390 --> 00:33:46,879
Well, if it helps, Ben,

351
00:33:47,624 --> 00:33:49,330
I forgive you.

352
00:33:52,847 --> 00:33:53,868
Thank you, John.

353
00:33:55,142 --> 00:33:56,343
That does help.

354
00:33:59,021 --> 00:34:01,178
It matters more than I can say.

355
00:34:03,348 --> 00:34:05,034
What are you gonna do now?

356
00:34:05,686 --> 00:34:07,668
I have some things
that I still need to work out.

357
00:34:07,957 --> 00:34:09,514
I think I'll stay here a while.

358
00:34:15,541 --> 00:34:17,787
You know, I don't think you need
to be in that chair anymore.

359
00:34:25,751 --> 00:34:27,085
Mm.

360
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:43,693
Good-bye, Ben.

361
00:35:28,061 --> 00:35:30,223
I think Desmond's
gonna be okay.

362
00:35:35,604 --> 00:35:36,998
Jack's... Gone.

363
00:35:40,310 --> 00:35:41,752
Isn't he?

364
00:35:51,787 --> 00:35:53,516
He did his job, Hugo.

365
00:35:55,102 --> 00:35:56,676
It's my job now.

366
00:35:59,712 --> 00:36:01,292
What the hell
am I supposed to to do?

367
00:36:04,367 --> 00:36:06,511
<i>I think you do
what you do best.</i>

368
00:36:09,213 --> 00:36:10,530
Take care of people.

369
00:36:13,785 --> 00:36:15,972
You can start
by helping Desmond get home.

370
00:36:16,921 --> 00:36:17,822
But how?

371
00:36:19,064 --> 00:36:20,489
People can't leave the island.

372
00:36:21,651 --> 00:36:23,105
That's how Jacob ran things.

373
00:36:24,822 --> 00:36:26,249
Maybe there's another way.

374
00:36:28,447 --> 00:36:29,673
<i>A better way.</i>

375
00:36:32,768 --> 00:36:33,945
Will you help me?

376
00:36:36,015 --> 00:36:36,852
I'm sorry?

377
00:36:37,729 --> 00:36:41,388
I could really use someone
with, like... Experience

378
00:36:41,881 --> 00:36:42,974
For a little while.

379
00:36:48,334 --> 00:36:49,451
Will you help me, Ben?

380
00:36:53,596 --> 00:36:54,992
I'd be honored.

381
00:36:59,178 --> 00:37:00,211
Cool.

382
00:37:14,187 --> 00:37:16,470
Oh! Hey, dude.

383
00:37:17,106 --> 00:37:18,488
Hello, Hugo.

384
00:37:19,244 --> 00:37:20,530
We're all inside.

385
00:37:22,535 --> 00:37:23,941
I don't think I'm coming in.

386
00:37:31,517 --> 00:37:32,538
You know...

387
00:37:33,931 --> 00:37:35,384
You were
a real good number two.

388
00:37:37,907 --> 00:37:40,045
And you were
a great number one, Hugo.

389
00:37:42,928 --> 00:37:43,956
Thanks, dude.

390
00:37:45,530 --> 00:37:46,407
I'll see you.

391
00:38:05,224 --> 00:38:06,689
Do you know where we are?

392
00:38:08,587 --> 00:38:10,665
This is where I was gonna
have my father's funeral.

393
00:38:12,991 --> 00:38:14,877
He died in Australia.

394
00:38:16,799 --> 00:38:17,892
I'm sorry.

395
00:38:21,063 --> 00:38:22,469
Why did you bring me here?

396
00:38:24,955 --> 00:38:27,658
Because this is where you were gonna have
your father's funeral.

397
00:38:32,667 --> 00:38:34,325
You can go in around back.

398
00:38:34,445 --> 00:38:36,811
Wait. W-where are you going?

399
00:38:37,196 --> 00:38:38,145
Inside.

400
00:38:40,056 --> 00:38:41,738
I'll be waiting for you
there...

401
00:38:42,579 --> 00:38:43,672
Once you're ready.

402
00:38:46,877 --> 00:38:47,982
Ready for what?

403
00:38:51,346 --> 00:38:52,126
To leave.

404
00:41:00,979 --> 00:41:02,747
?

405
00:41:15,761 --> 00:41:18,729
?

406
00:41:33,111 --> 00:41:36,847
?

407
00:42:09,640 --> 00:42:10,685
Hey, kiddo.

408
00:42:21,835 --> 00:42:22,796
Dad?

409
00:42:25,130 --> 00:42:26,352
Hello, Jack.

410
00:42:30,015 --> 00:42:31,659
I don't understand.

411
00:42:34,171 --> 00:42:35,240
You died.

412
00:42:36,309 --> 00:42:37,006
Yeah.

413
00:42:38,075 --> 00:42:39,168
Yes, I did.

414
00:42:42,255 --> 00:42:44,224
Then how are you here
right now?

415
00:42:49,034 --> 00:42:50,427
<i>How are you here?</i>

416
00:43:06,006 --> 00:43:07,267
I died, too.

417
00:43:15,023 --> 00:43:16,296
It's okay.

418
00:43:16,644 --> 00:43:18,230
It's okay.

419
00:43:18,915 --> 00:43:20,524
It's okay, son.

420
00:43:36,710 --> 00:43:39,603
- I love you, dad.
- I love you, too, son.

421
00:43:42,042 --> 00:43:43,219
Are you...

422
00:43:45,429 --> 00:43:46,678
Are you real?

423
00:43:48,695 --> 00:43:50,077
I sure hope so.

424
00:43:52,035 --> 00:43:53,468
Yeah, I'm real.

425
00:43:53,756 --> 00:43:54,993
You're real.

426
00:43:55,414 --> 00:43:57,864
Everything that's ever happened
to you is real.

427
00:43:58,776 --> 00:44:00,410
All those
people in the church--

428
00:44:01,093 --> 00:44:02,796
They're all real, too.

429
00:44:03,517 --> 00:44:04,598
They're all...

430
00:44:05,667 --> 00:44:07,048
They're all dead?

431
00:44:09,902 --> 00:44:12,064
Everyone dies sometime, kiddo.

432
00:44:16,875 --> 00:44:18,907
Some of them before you,
some...

433
00:44:19,328 --> 00:44:20,829
Long after you.

434
00:44:22,481 --> 00:44:24,645
But why are they all here now?

435
00:44:26,386 --> 00:44:29,872
Well, there is no "now" here.

436
00:44:43,243 --> 00:44:45,033
Where are we, dad?

437
00:44:47,180 --> 00:44:50,111
This is a place that you--
that you all made together

438
00:44:50,231 --> 00:44:51,985
So that you could find
one another.

439
00:44:59,495 --> 00:45:02,630
The most important part
of your life

440
00:45:03,279 --> 00:45:05,614
Was the time that you spent
with these people.

441
00:45:07,512 --> 00:45:09,422
That's why all of you are here.

442
00:45:10,419 --> 00:45:12,414
Nobody does it alone, Jack.

443
00:45:13,615 --> 00:45:15,309
You needed all of them,

444
00:45:16,114 --> 00:45:17,589
And they needed you.

445
00:45:20,808 --> 00:45:22,092
For what?

446
00:45:25,587 --> 00:45:27,053
To remember.

447
00:45:30,182 --> 00:45:32,234
And to... Let go.

448
00:45:39,458 --> 00:45:40,314
Kate--

449
00:45:41,287 --> 00:45:42,944
She said we were leaving.

450
00:45:43,701 --> 00:45:45,094
Not leave. No.

451
00:45:48,470 --> 00:45:49,971
Moving on.

452
00:45:56,012 --> 00:45:57,285
Where are we going?

453
00:46:02,118 --> 00:46:03,595
Let's go find out.

454
00:46:18,296 --> 00:46:21,298
?

455
00:46:43,352 --> 00:46:45,045
We've been waitin' for ya.

456
00:46:56,134 --> 00:46:59,537
?

457
00:48:27,425 --> 00:48:31,028
?

458
00:49:20,245 --> 00:49:24,048
?

459
