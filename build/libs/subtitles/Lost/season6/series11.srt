1
00:00:09,278 --> 00:00:10,548
Mr. Hume.

2
00:00:11,573 --> 00:00:12,804
My name is Zoe.

3
00:00:13,742 --> 00:00:14,660
I know you're disoriented.

4
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:17,805
You've been unconscious for the last three days.

5
00:00:18,019 --> 00:00:20,197
But you're off the I.V. sedation now.

6
00:00:20,315 --> 00:00:23,118
And I've just given you a shot to help you wake up.

7
00:00:27,806 --> 00:00:29,212
Are you a nurse?

8
00:00:29,739 --> 00:00:31,615
You're not in a hospital anymore, Mr. Hume.

9
00:00:31,615 --> 00:00:32,709
We had to move you.

10
00:00:33,617 --> 00:00:35,990
What? Move... move me? Move me where?

11
00:00:36,088 --> 00:00:37,357
Where's my wife? 

12
00:00:37,455 --> 00:00:40,073
No. Wait. Mr... you shouldn't... you shouldn't...

13
00:00:40,073 --> 00:00:41,284
I wanna see Penny.

14
00:00:41,284 --> 00:00:43,501
I'm afraid that's not gonna be possible, Desmond.

15
00:00:48,863 --> 00:00:49,947
You.

16
00:00:52,886 --> 00:00:53,394
Mr. Hume... 

17
00:00:53,404 --> 00:00:56,100
- Easy. Easy. I'll take it from here.
- You should sit.

18
00:00:56,057 --> 00:00:57,053
Desmond.

19
00:01:01,027 --> 00:01:03,488
What happened to me? Where am I?

20
00:01:03,527 --> 00:01:06,702
You were shot by Benjamin Linus.

21
00:01:06,868 --> 00:01:08,157
Do you remember that?

22
00:01:09,055 --> 00:01:10,159
Yes, I remember.

23
00:01:11,019 --> 00:01:12,855
Yeah, I wanna talk to Penny. Penny!

24
00:01:12,855 --> 00:01:15,765
She's not here. But I assure you,

25
00:01:15,765 --> 00:01:18,597
both she and your son are perfectly safe.

26
00:01:18,597 --> 00:01:21,117
I'm really sorry for taking you away from them,

27
00:01:21,117 --> 00:01:23,686
but I didn't have a chance to explain, and...

28
00:01:24,243 --> 00:01:27,212
if I had, you never would've come with me.

29
00:01:27,895 --> 00:01:29,194
Come with you?

30
00:01:30,542 --> 00:01:31,753
Come with you where?

31
00:01:34,332 --> 00:01:36,324
I brought you back to the island.

32
00:01:39,244 --> 00:01:42,321
I... can't imagine how you must be feeling.

33
00:01:42,350 --> 00:01:44,294
But if you'll give me a chance to explain... 

34
00:01:50,212 --> 00:01:52,439
- Damn it! Don't hurt him!  - You take me back!

35
00:01:52,439 --> 00:01:56,648
- You take me back right now, you hear!?
- I can't take you back.

36
00:01:57,713 --> 00:01:59,686
The island isn't done with you yet.

37
00:02:04,984 --> 00:02:06,830
Aah!

38
00:02:06,850 --> 00:02:08,286
What is Desmond doing here?

39
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,268
It will be easier for me

40
00:02:10,268 --> 00:02:12,632
to show you than to tell you, Mr. Kwon.

41
00:02:12,632 --> 00:02:14,224
Take him with you to the generator room.

42
00:02:14,233 --> 00:02:16,656
I'll be along with Hume so we can start the test.

43
00:02:16,656 --> 00:02:19,293
Charles, that... that... that test isn't scheduled till tomorrow.

44
00:02:19,293 --> 00:02:22,408
I know when it's scheduled. Get them ready now.

45
00:02:44,246 --> 00:02:46,278
Come on. No time for sightseeing.

46
00:02:56,552 --> 00:02:58,818
They're bringing Hume down now.

47
00:02:58,818 --> 00:03:01,074
- What?!
- You heard me. We are go right now.

48
00:03:01,074 --> 00:03:03,106
- What's your time Frame?
- We're not even close to being ready.

49
00:03:03,106 --> 00:03:05,245
This generator probably hasn't run in 20 years.

50
00:03:05,245 --> 00:03:06,895
- How am I supposed to...
- Widmore doesn't want to wait.

51
00:03:06,895 --> 00:03:08,731
- What are you doing here?
- Running a little test.

52
00:03:08,731 --> 00:03:10,548
- What kind of test?
- All right, let's see where we are.

53
00:03:10,548 --> 00:03:13,009
- Can we get a functioning M. Field going, people?
- Sure thing.

54
00:03:13,009 --> 00:03:15,949
- Let's try a power test. Generator to full, please.
- Okay.

55
00:03:16,115 --> 00:03:16,818
Okay. 

56
00:03:17,434 --> 00:03:19,406
Here we go. On my count...

57
00:03:19,758 --> 00:03:23,372
Three... Two... One.

58
00:03:23,381 --> 00:03:24,446
And power on.

59
00:03:29,798 --> 00:03:30,746
Great.

60
00:03:30,746 --> 00:03:33,314
We probably got a faulty contact somewhere. Find it.

61
00:03:33,685 --> 00:03:35,990
Simmons, go down and check the circuits on the solenoids.

62
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,514
- Yes, sir.
- Try it again.

63
00:03:38,364 --> 00:03:39,672
Guess what, Angstrom?

64
00:03:39,672 --> 00:03:40,991
You're going in there next.

65
00:04:03,894 --> 00:04:04,665
Found it!

66
00:04:04,665 --> 00:04:06,863
It's a bad breaker on the genny.

67
00:04:07,244 --> 00:04:09,109
- Bringing it back online now.
- No!

68
00:04:14,285 --> 00:04:15,067
No!

69
00:04:16,336 --> 00:04:18,046
Turn it off! Turn it off!

70
00:04:37,802 --> 00:04:38,690
Zoe.

71
00:04:40,553 --> 00:04:42,087
- Are we ready?

72
00:05:16,218 --> 00:05:17,185
Stop.

73
00:05:26,717 --> 00:05:28,406
You can take him now. Thank you.

74
00:05:30,791 --> 00:05:31,817
Put him inside.

75
00:05:31,817 --> 00:05:35,050
No! Hey! What the hell are you doing?!

76
00:05:39,054 --> 00:05:40,763
Uhh! Aah!

77
00:05:42,726 --> 00:05:44,562
- I know how this looks, Desmond.
- Aah!

78
00:05:44,836 --> 00:05:47,258
But if everything I've been told about you is true,

79
00:05:47,258 --> 00:05:48,635
you'll be perfectly fine.

80
00:05:48,948 --> 00:05:51,507
You don't have any metal on you, do you? Keys? Change?

81
00:05:51,507 --> 00:05:52,942
Of course he doesn't, you idiot.

82
00:05:55,454 --> 00:05:58,062
I hate to resort to forcing this upon you, Desmond...

83
00:05:59,576 --> 00:06:01,011
But once it's over,

84
00:06:01,949 --> 00:06:04,205
I'm going to ask you to make a sacrifice.

85
00:06:05,572 --> 00:06:08,043
And I hope, for all our sakes, you'll help me.

86
00:06:08,473 --> 00:06:10,085
Sacrifice?

87
00:06:11,784 --> 00:06:14,128
What the bloody hell do you know about sacrifice?

88
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:20,935
My son died here for the sake of this island.

89
00:06:21,443 --> 00:06:23,719
Your wife...  my own daughter... 

90
00:06:23,719 --> 00:06:24,783
hates me.

91
00:06:25,330 --> 00:06:27,626
And I've never even met my grandson.

92
00:06:28,876 --> 00:06:30,263
But if you won't help me, Desmond,

93
00:06:30,263 --> 00:06:32,030
all of it will be for nothing.

94
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:36,445
Penny, your son and everyone else

95
00:06:37,197 --> 00:06:39,590
will be gone... forever.

96
00:06:48,849 --> 00:06:50,460
Aah!

97
00:06:50,607 --> 00:06:51,876
Uhh!

98
00:06:59,572 --> 00:07:00,842
Aah!

99
00:07:06,307 --> 00:07:08,202
All right. Turn it on.

100
00:07:08,202 --> 00:07:10,829
No. If you want me to help you with whatever you're doing here,

101
00:07:10,839 --> 00:07:11,679
you need to explain to me... 

102
00:07:11,679 --> 00:07:14,961
That man is the only person I'm aware of in the world

103
00:07:14,961 --> 00:07:17,930
who has survived a catastrophic electromagnetic event.

104
00:07:17,969 --> 00:07:20,352
I need to know that he can do it again,

105
00:07:20,381 --> 00:07:22,012
or we all die.

106
00:07:22,129 --> 00:07:23,399
Turn it on.

107
00:07:41,186 --> 00:07:44,048
- Do we have full power?
- Yeah, but...

108
00:07:51,138 --> 00:07:52,369
Let me out!

109
00:08:00,876 --> 00:08:02,858
Let me out of here, you bastards!

110
00:08:02,907 --> 00:08:04,147
Let me out!

111
00:08:04,392 --> 00:08:06,179
Let me out of here!

112
00:08:10,242 --> 00:08:11,736
Let me out of here! 

113
00:08:39,186 --> 00:08:40,612
It's Carousel 4.

114
00:08:42,409 --> 00:08:43,816
Sorry?

115
00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:45,622
You were on the Sydney flight, right?

116
00:08:45,622 --> 00:08:47,712
- Yeah.  - Our bags are on Carousel 4.

117
00:08:47,712 --> 00:08:49,343
I double-checked it with the dude at the counter.

118
00:08:49,343 --> 00:08:50,926
Thank you.

119
00:09:00,479 --> 00:09:02,189
Hang on. I've got it. I got it.

120
00:09:03,419 --> 00:09:04,933
Thank you so much.

121
00:09:05,265 --> 00:09:06,349
Pleasure.

122
00:09:06,906 --> 00:09:08,244
Do you have any more bags?

123
00:09:08,244 --> 00:09:10,559
No. Uh, that's it, thank God. 

124
00:09:11,232 --> 00:09:14,514
- Boy or a girl?  - Um...

125
00:09:14,514 --> 00:09:18,274
- Oh, I'm sorry. I... I... I didn't mean to pry.
- Oh, no, no. It's... it's fine.

126
00:09:18,274 --> 00:09:20,521
I just, um... I don't know what it is.

127
00:09:20,521 --> 00:09:21,116
Oh, right.

128
00:09:21,116 --> 00:09:25,013
Well, you're braver than I. I'm not a big fan of surprises.

129
00:09:27,172 --> 00:09:29,105
Oh, excuse me. That's mine.

130
00:09:40,175 --> 00:09:43,193
So... have... have you got someone meeting you?

131
00:09:43,193 --> 00:09:45,595
Uh, yeah. I... I don't know. Maybe they got the...

132
00:09:45,595 --> 00:09:47,099
Flights mixed up or something.

133
00:09:47,099 --> 00:09:48,994
Because I've got a car picking me up.

134
00:09:48,994 --> 00:09:50,020
You know, if you need a ride,

135
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:51,201
I'd be more than happy to give you a lift.

136
00:09:51,201 --> 00:09:53,614
Oh, no, no, no. That's, um, that's really sweet of you,

137
00:09:53,614 --> 00:09:55,919
- But I'm... I'm good. There's cabs, so...
- Oh. Oh, all right. Yeah.

138
00:09:55,929 --> 00:09:59,357
- Well, it was nice meeting you.
- Yeah, nice to meet you, too.

139
00:09:59,855 --> 00:10:00,802
A boy.

140
00:10:01,447 --> 00:10:03,312
- What?
- I bet it's a boy.

141
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:07,824
... Lockers located at Baggage Claim Entrance.

142
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:12,219
Detailed baggage claim information on...

143
00:10:18,765 --> 00:10:20,406
Looks like I'm with you.

144
00:10:20,406 --> 00:10:23,023
Mr. Hume. Hello. Let me grab that for you.

145
00:10:23,023 --> 00:10:23,765
Thank you.

146
00:10:23,765 --> 00:10:26,031
- My name is George.
- Hi, George.

147
00:10:26,031 --> 00:10:28,571
So I will take you back to your hotel?

148
00:10:28,571 --> 00:10:29,498
The office.

149
00:10:29,498 --> 00:10:31,833
Office. Wonderful. Um, this way, please.

150
00:10:35,351 --> 00:10:37,792
So, uh, you... you flew in from Sydney, huh?

151
00:10:37,792 --> 00:10:39,013
Yeah. That's right.

152
00:10:40,234 --> 00:10:41,845
And what... what were you doin', uh....

153
00:10:41,845 --> 00:10:43,174
Down Under?

154
00:10:44,033 --> 00:10:45,586
I was closing a deal for the boss.

155
00:10:45,586 --> 00:10:47,793
Oh. Good for you. Congratulations.

156
00:10:48,125 --> 00:10:49,473
Hey, listen, if you need anything at all

157
00:10:49,473 --> 00:10:51,553
while you're in town, I know everyone.

158
00:10:51,553 --> 00:10:53,858
If you need a reservation, you just pick a restaurant.

159
00:10:53,858 --> 00:10:55,275
Uh, the Room Service at the hotel is excellent.

160
00:10:55,275 --> 00:10:55,958
Thank you.

161
00:10:58,234 --> 00:10:59,064
You, uh,

162
00:10:59,064 --> 00:11:01,056
you looking, uh, for some company?

163
00:11:01,691 --> 00:11:03,957
Well, I noticed that you weren't wearing a wedding band,

164
00:11:03,957 --> 00:11:06,663
and there are a lot of lovely ladies

165
00:11:06,663 --> 00:11:08,762
offering their, uh, "companionship."

166
00:11:08,762 --> 00:11:10,237
I'm not looking for any companionship.

167
00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:11,536
I'm here to work.

168
00:11:12,864 --> 00:11:14,857
Guess that's why you're e boss's right-hand man,

169
00:11:14,857 --> 00:11:16,908
and I am the driver.

170
00:11:18,490 --> 00:11:19,994
Okay. Got it.

171
00:11:29,057 --> 00:11:32,241
- Good morning, Mr. Hume. How was your flight?
- Lovely, thank you.

172
00:11:32,241 --> 00:11:33,648
- He said to send you right in.
- Thank you.

173
00:11:41,363 --> 00:11:42,975
Charles.

174
00:11:43,356 --> 00:11:44,674
Hello, Desmond.

175
00:11:46,979 --> 00:11:48,864
Welcome to Los Angeles, my friend.

176
00:11:49,431 --> 00:11:50,359
Thank you.

177
00:12:01,047 --> 00:12:03,391
I don't give a bloody damn what he did

178
00:12:03,391 --> 00:12:05,110
or how much it's going to cost.

179
00:12:05,823 --> 00:12:08,499
Just get him arraigned and get him out of there.

180
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:12,142
Sorry, Desmond.

181
00:12:12,562 --> 00:12:14,193
Looks like our celebration of the Australian deal

182
00:12:14,203 --> 00:12:16,176
is gonna have to be cut short.

183
00:12:16,478 --> 00:12:18,471
You are aware that my son is a musician?

184
00:12:18,471 --> 00:12:20,580
Yes. I've heard he's quite talented.

185
00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:22,260
Yeah, he is, quite.

186
00:12:22,415 --> 00:12:23,958
Anyway, my wife is putting together

187
00:12:23,958 --> 00:12:25,491
one of her charity events,

188
00:12:25,491 --> 00:12:28,197
and, uh, the boy had the crazy idea

189
00:12:28,197 --> 00:12:30,921
to combine classical music with modern rock.

190
00:12:31,283 --> 00:12:34,057
Have you heard of a band called Drive Shaft?

191
00:12:34,144 --> 00:12:35,805
No can't say I have.

192
00:12:35,805 --> 00:12:39,584
Their bass guitarist overdosed and, uh, got himself arrested.

193
00:12:39,584 --> 00:12:42,817
And now if I don't get this junkie to my wife's event,

194
00:12:42,817 --> 00:12:45,817
she will, simply put, destroy me.

195
00:12:45,945 --> 00:12:48,612
- So you want me to babysit him.
- I know it's beneath you,

196
00:12:48,612 --> 00:12:50,829
but I need someone I can trust to do the job right.

197
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:52,889
Say no more, Charles. It's done.

198
00:12:55,536 --> 00:12:57,382
You really do have the life, son.

199
00:12:58,134 --> 00:12:59,638
No family,

200
00:12:59,658 --> 00:13:00,830
no commitments.

201
00:13:01,386 --> 00:13:03,506
Ah, to be free of attachments.

202
00:13:04,434 --> 00:13:06,084
I'm a blessed man, sir.

203
00:13:06,192 --> 00:13:08,663
No, it is I who am blessed

204
00:13:08,663 --> 00:13:10,284
to have you in my employ. 

205
00:13:11,075 --> 00:13:14,562
A drink to celebrate your indispensability.

206
00:13:17,062 --> 00:13:19,562
That's your 60-year-old Scotch, Charles.

207
00:13:22,102 --> 00:13:23,723
Nothing's too good for you.

208
00:13:25,793 --> 00:13:26,897
Slaninte.

209
00:13:54,144 --> 00:13:55,101
Mr. Hume?

210
00:13:55,101 --> 00:13:56,039
That's right.

211
00:13:56,420 --> 00:13:58,002
Bail's all been taken care of.

212
00:13:58,012 --> 00:14:00,004
Remember, he's not allowed to leave the state.

213
00:14:01,186 --> 00:14:03,442
Mr. Pace, I'm Desmond Hume.

214
00:14:03,686 --> 00:14:05,307
Charles Widmore sent me...

215
00:14:06,245 --> 00:14:07,388
Hey.

216
00:14:07,583 --> 00:14:08,814
Where you going?

217
00:14:09,273 --> 00:14:10,855
He's all yours.

218
00:14:16,588 --> 00:14:17,828
Hey! 

219
00:14:22,770 --> 00:14:24,020
Hey! What's wrong with you?!

220
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:27,917
Come on.

221
00:14:37,713 --> 00:14:39,891
Yeah, I'll have whatever he's having.

222
00:14:42,811 --> 00:14:44,745
One drink, then we go.

223
00:14:47,167 --> 00:14:50,058
So what's your job then...  to babysit me?

224
00:14:50,058 --> 00:14:52,851
What are you? Mr. Widmore's chief lackey?

225
00:14:53,594 --> 00:14:54,619
Henchman?

226
00:14:54,619 --> 00:14:55,615
No title.

227
00:14:56,182 --> 00:14:57,207
Plenty of perks, though.

228
00:14:57,207 --> 00:14:58,985
Mm. Such as?

229
00:14:59,503 --> 00:15:01,231
I get to meet charming people.

230
00:15:02,735 --> 00:15:04,923
Well... Cheers, then.

231
00:15:08,787 --> 00:15:11,756
Tell me, perky. Are you happy?

232
00:15:12,137 --> 00:15:13,192
Quite.

233
00:15:14,295 --> 00:15:15,594
No, you're not.

234
00:15:16,327 --> 00:15:18,388
Well, I've got a great job, lots of money,

235
00:15:18,397 --> 00:15:21,591
Travel the world. Why wouldn't I be happy?

236
00:15:21,591 --> 00:15:24,443
- Have you ever been in love?
- Dozens of times.

237
00:15:24,443 --> 00:15:26,123
That's not what I'm talking about.

238
00:15:26,123 --> 00:15:31,582
I'm talking about spectacular, consciousness-altering love.

239
00:15:31,651 --> 00:15:33,536
Do you know what that looks like?

240
00:15:33,536 --> 00:15:35,665
I wasn't aware that love looked like anything.

241
00:15:36,085 --> 00:15:39,728
I've seen it, mate...  on the plane back from Sydney.

242
00:15:39,757 --> 00:15:41,261
Is that so?

243
00:15:41,965 --> 00:15:44,035
Well, we were on the same flight, so...

244
00:15:44,035 --> 00:15:45,549
maybe I saw it, too.

245
00:15:47,121 --> 00:15:49,036
Trust me. You didn't.

246
00:15:49,114 --> 00:15:52,249
No? Enlighten me.

247
00:15:53,898 --> 00:15:55,460
There was this woman

248
00:15:55,773 --> 00:15:59,181
two rows in front of me...  in handcuffs... 

249
00:15:59,181 --> 00:16:00,949
sittin' with a cop.

250
00:16:01,809 --> 00:16:03,117
He looked at me,

251
00:16:03,117 --> 00:16:04,827
knew I was holding.

252
00:16:05,559 --> 00:16:07,786
If I didn't take action, I'd be caught.

253
00:16:07,884 --> 00:16:10,550
So I got up, went to the lav...

254
00:16:10,765 --> 00:16:12,962
proceeded to eliminate the evidence

255
00:16:12,962 --> 00:16:14,896
by swallowing my stash.

256
00:16:15,570 --> 00:16:18,441
And at that exact moment,

257
00:16:18,441 --> 00:16:20,453
we hit turbulence.

258
00:16:21,526 --> 00:16:22,913
I choked.

259
00:16:24,924 --> 00:16:29,378
The entire bag of heroin is stuck in my throat.

260
00:16:29,378 --> 00:16:33,168
It's, uh, it's over. Everything starts to go dark.

261
00:16:33,168 --> 00:16:35,599
I'm slippin' into the abyss, and then...

262
00:16:35,853 --> 00:16:38,578
I see... her.

263
00:16:39,721 --> 00:16:41,137
"Her"?

264
00:16:41,743 --> 00:16:43,237
A woman.

265
00:16:43,403 --> 00:16:44,809
Blonde.

266
00:16:44,809 --> 00:16:46,880
Rapturously beautiful.

267
00:16:47,025 --> 00:16:48,333
And I know her.

268
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:50,931
We're together.

269
00:16:51,351 --> 00:16:52,748
It's like...

270
00:16:52,777 --> 00:16:54,730
You've always been, and...

271
00:16:55,141 --> 00:16:56,791
always will be.

272
00:16:57,133 --> 00:16:58,725
This...

273
00:16:59,819 --> 00:17:01,860
feeling, this...

274
00:17:03,433 --> 00:17:04,751
love.

275
00:17:07,828 --> 00:17:11,070
And just as I'm about to be engulfed by it.

276
00:17:12,037 --> 00:17:13,834
I open my eyes,

277
00:17:13,951 --> 00:17:15,953
and this sodding idiot

278
00:17:16,168 --> 00:17:19,733
is standing there, asking me if I'm okay.

279
00:17:20,180 --> 00:17:21,567
But I saw it.

280
00:17:21,567 --> 00:17:24,243
Just for a moment, I saw what it looked like.

281
00:17:25,855 --> 00:17:27,916
Well, that's just...

282
00:17:28,355 --> 00:17:30,074
poetry, brother.

283
00:17:30,357 --> 00:17:32,379
You know, you should... you should write a song about that.

284
00:17:32,379 --> 00:17:34,840
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I know what you're saying.

285
00:17:35,387 --> 00:17:38,122
"Poor suicidal rock star."

286
00:17:38,327 --> 00:17:42,351
But I've seen something real. I've seen the truth.

287
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,138
No, that's not the truth.

288
00:17:44,304 --> 00:17:46,570
You wanna know the real truth, Pace?

289
00:17:47,049 --> 00:17:48,758
Right now you have a choice.

290
00:17:48,767 --> 00:17:52,010
You can keep on drinkin', or you can come with me.

291
00:17:52,059 --> 00:17:55,829
Now before you make your choice, realize that if you stay here,

292
00:17:55,839 --> 00:17:57,841
it will very likely result

293
00:17:58,046 --> 00:18:00,614
in the extermination of your musical career.

294
00:18:01,189 --> 00:18:02,703
And if I go with you?

295
00:18:03,113 --> 00:18:03,865
20 minutes,

296
00:18:03,875 --> 00:18:06,043
you'll be luxuriating in a five-star hotel,

297
00:18:06,062 --> 00:18:09,002
right on the harbor front. Charles Widmore,

298
00:18:09,002 --> 00:18:10,887
one of the most powerful men in this town,

299
00:18:10,887 --> 00:18:12,440
will owe you favor.

300
00:18:14,178 --> 00:18:16,757
Doesn't really seem like a choice.

301
00:18:18,827 --> 00:18:20,908
There's always a choice, brother.

302
00:18:28,223 --> 00:18:30,684
# You all, everybody #

303
00:18:31,378 --> 00:18:34,522
- # You all, everybody #  - That's my band.

304
00:18:35,108 --> 00:18:36,925
- # Acting like you're stupid people #  - Drive shaft.

305
00:18:37,072 --> 00:18:39,845
- Our first single.  - # Wearing expensive clothes #

306
00:18:39,845 --> 00:18:41,681
The beginning of everything great.

307
00:18:41,847 --> 00:18:44,211
# You all, everybody #

308
00:18:44,983 --> 00:18:47,414
# You all, everybody #

309
00:18:48,528 --> 00:18:49,661
You like it?

310
00:18:50,403 --> 00:18:52,894
- # You all, everybody #  - Sure. For what it is.

311
00:18:54,808 --> 00:18:56,390
I feel sorry for you, mate.

312
00:18:57,289 --> 00:19:00,961
You think you're happy. You think you got it all.

313
00:19:01,185 --> 00:19:03,901
This... your life.

314
00:19:05,092 --> 00:19:06,176
But you don't.

315
00:19:06,528 --> 00:19:08,393
Hmm. Why, because none of it's real?

316
00:19:08,491 --> 00:19:10,132
# You all... #

317
00:19:10,132 --> 00:19:13,579
All right, Mr. Hume. How about I offer you a choice?

318
00:19:14,585 --> 00:19:15,542
What's that?

319
00:19:16,001 --> 00:19:19,224
I can either show you what I'm talking about,

320
00:19:19,371 --> 00:19:20,807
or you can get out of the car.

321
00:19:22,027 --> 00:19:24,078
Why in god's name would I want to get out of... 

322
00:19:50,439 --> 00:19:52,675
Charlie! Charlie!

323
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:54,521
Come on!

324
00:21:05,662 --> 00:21:06,951
Come on!

325
00:21:07,136 --> 00:21:08,123
Come on!

326
00:21:14,129 --> 00:21:15,467
Come on, damn it!

327
00:21:25,728 --> 00:21:27,926
You sustained a pretty bad bump in your accident.

328
00:21:27,926 --> 00:21:29,283
Any nausea?

329
00:21:29,283 --> 00:21:30,475
Nope.

330
00:21:30,475 --> 00:21:31,774
- Double vision?
- No.

331
00:21:31,774 --> 00:21:34,069
Listen, I need to find the man that I was brought in here with.

332
00:21:34,069 --> 00:21:35,924
How about hallucinations?

333
00:21:39,606 --> 00:21:40,808
What do you mean?

334
00:21:40,808 --> 00:21:43,767
Hallucinations. Seeing things that aren't there.

335
00:21:45,974 --> 00:21:47,654
Um...

336
00:21:49,725 --> 00:21:51,131
I'm not sure.

337
00:21:51,131 --> 00:21:53,944
Well, your C.A.T. scan was inconclusive.

338
00:21:54,032 --> 00:21:55,878
I'm gonna send you downstairs for an M.R.I.

339
00:21:55,878 --> 00:21:57,880
No, I don't have time for this.

340
00:21:57,929 --> 00:22:00,771
- I need to find the man I came in here with.
- I'm afraid you're not finding anyone

341
00:22:00,771 --> 00:22:04,365
till we know what's going on inside your brain.

342
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,803
Are you wearing any metal, carrying keys or chains?

343
00:22:07,803 --> 00:22:10,684
Any metal inside your body...  pacemakers, pins, bullets?

344
00:22:10,684 --> 00:22:13,673
- Steel plate inside of your head?
- No, nothing.

345
00:22:13,731 --> 00:22:15,958
I see you didn't list an emergency contact.

346
00:22:15,958 --> 00:22:17,794
No friends or family?

347
00:22:18,448 --> 00:22:19,728
Um...

348
00:22:19,728 --> 00:22:22,580
Just put down my employer...  Charles Widmore.

349
00:22:24,885 --> 00:22:26,838
This machine is super loud.

350
00:22:26,838 --> 00:22:28,733
You're gonna want these.

351
00:22:33,528 --> 00:22:35,208
And you need the button.

352
00:22:35,257 --> 00:22:37,230
- Button?
- Panic button.

353
00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:39,662
You need to stop, press it. But try not to,

354
00:22:39,662 --> 00:22:41,693
'cause we'll have to start all over again from the beginning.

355
00:22:41,693 --> 00:22:42,660
I'll be in that booth over there.

356
00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:45,922
You'll be able to hear me. 30 minutes, okay?

357
00:23:09,145 --> 00:23:11,323
Okay, here we go.

358
00:23:36,199 --> 00:23:37,791
Desmond?

359
00:23:38,863 --> 00:23:40,074
Hey!

360
00:23:40,074 --> 00:23:42,594
Hey, let me out of here!

361
00:23:42,594 --> 00:23:43,952
Hey!

362
00:23:43,952 --> 00:23:45,749
Hey!

363
00:23:46,149 --> 00:23:49,284
- What happened, man? Are you all right?
- I need to find the man I came in here with.

364
00:23:51,433 --> 00:23:53,406
I need to find the man I came in here with.

365
00:23:54,646 --> 00:23:57,020
His name is Charlie Pace. He came in an hour ago.

366
00:23:57,020 --> 00:24:00,946
- If you'd just give me his room number...
- If you're not a relative, that's confidential information.

367
00:24:00,946 --> 00:24:03,886
Look, we were in an accident together. I need to see him.

368
00:24:03,886 --> 00:24:06,064
Sorry, sir. There's nothing I can do.

369
00:24:07,216 --> 00:24:08,300
Hey.

370
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:10,185
E... excuse me.

371
00:24:10,595 --> 00:24:13,135
Um... We were on the same Oceanic flight.

372
00:24:13,135 --> 00:24:14,795
Um, from Sydney.

373
00:24:14,795 --> 00:24:17,500
Yeah, yeah. You were, uh, you were sitting next to me.

374
00:24:18,389 --> 00:24:20,196
- Desmond, right?
- Yeah, that's right.

375
00:24:20,196 --> 00:24:22,276
Listen, I-I wonder if you can help me, brother.

376
00:24:22,276 --> 00:24:24,083
I need to find someone. He was on our plane.

377
00:24:24,083 --> 00:24:27,091
- He's somewhere in the hospital.
- Wait. He was on our plane,

378
00:24:27,091 --> 00:24:28,830
and now he's here in the hospital?

379
00:24:28,830 --> 00:24:32,326
- None of this matters! None of this matters!
- No! Sir, please! Stop!

380
00:24:32,326 --> 00:24:33,733
Take it easy.

381
00:24:59,985 --> 00:25:03,169
- Why you running?
- 'Cause no one here can help me. Now let me go.

382
00:25:03,169 --> 00:25:06,060
- Why'd you try and kill me?
- I didn't try and kill you.

383
00:25:06,060 --> 00:25:07,877
I was trying to show you something.

384
00:25:07,877 --> 00:25:10,074
- You wanna show me something? Show me your hand.
- What?

385
00:25:10,074 --> 00:25:12,262
Your hand. Show me your bloody hands now.

386
00:25:12,653 --> 00:25:14,919
You saw something, didn't you?

387
00:25:14,919 --> 00:25:16,139
In the water.

388
00:25:16,989 --> 00:25:18,796
What was it?

389
00:25:19,284 --> 00:25:21,570
What are you looking for, mate?

390
00:25:23,386 --> 00:25:24,959
Who's Penny?

391
00:25:25,174 --> 00:25:26,707
I don't know.

392
00:25:27,898 --> 00:25:29,559
Ah.

393
00:25:30,301 --> 00:25:32,958
- You felt it, didn't you? I didn't feel anything.

394
00:25:32,958 --> 00:25:36,620
- Then why are you accosting a man in a dressing gown?
- All right, come on. We're leaving.

395
00:25:36,620 --> 00:25:40,712
Whoa! You think I'm gonna go play a rock concert after this?

396
00:25:41,152 --> 00:25:42,929
This doesn't matter.

397
00:25:43,056 --> 00:25:44,932
None of this matters.

398
00:25:45,156 --> 00:25:48,067
All that matters is that we felt it.

399
00:25:48,682 --> 00:25:51,485
You wanna try and stop me? Good luck.

400
00:25:52,501 --> 00:25:54,796
Hey. Where you going?

401
00:25:54,962 --> 00:25:58,019
If I were you, I'd stop worrying about me

402
00:25:58,556 --> 00:26:00,431
and start looking for Penny.

403
00:26:12,409 --> 00:26:14,050
What do you mean he's gone?

404
00:26:14,050 --> 00:26:16,745
He knocked over a doctor with a bloody crash cart

405
00:26:16,745 --> 00:26:18,914
- and then ran out of hospital.
- And you let him go?

406
00:26:18,914 --> 00:26:21,824
He's a junkie who drove my car into the ocean, Charles.

407
00:26:21,824 --> 00:26:26,610
- I'm fine, by the way. Thanks for asking.
- And I'm thrilled you survived, Desmond.

408
00:26:26,610 --> 00:26:29,296
But when I give you a job to do, I expect you to do it.

409
00:26:29,296 --> 00:26:33,778
- With all due respect, sir, it's just a bloody concert.
- I'll tell you what, Desmond.

410
00:26:33,778 --> 00:26:35,546
If you can't deliver Pace,

411
00:26:35,546 --> 00:26:39,619
why don't you tell Mrs. Widmore it's only a bloody concert?

412
00:26:52,726 --> 00:26:54,279
Mr. Hume.

413
00:26:59,582 --> 00:27:03,244
So you've never met the boss's wife, huh?

414
00:27:04,426 --> 00:27:05,559
No.

415
00:27:05,559 --> 00:27:07,122
Good luck.

416
00:27:12,298 --> 00:27:13,939
Please tell me how it is

417
00:27:13,939 --> 00:27:16,986
that someone in your line of work is not aware

418
00:27:16,986 --> 00:27:20,688
that the butter knife is placed handle to the right?

419
00:27:20,688 --> 00:27:24,360
- Blade facing left just so.
- Okay.

420
00:27:24,809 --> 00:27:27,056
For god sake. 

421
00:27:31,451 --> 00:27:32,486
Mrs. Widmore?

422
00:27:32,486 --> 00:27:34,000
Yes?

423
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:37,369
My name is Desmond Hume. I work for your husband.

424
00:27:37,701 --> 00:27:39,791
Oh, of course, Mr. Hume.

425
00:27:39,791 --> 00:27:42,331
Charles has told me so much about you.

426
00:27:42,487 --> 00:27:45,270
It's a travesty we haven't met before.

427
00:27:45,632 --> 00:27:47,439
Well, it's about time.

428
00:27:47,439 --> 00:27:49,070
Well, the feeling is mutual, Mrs. Widmore.

429
00:27:49,070 --> 00:27:51,970
Oh, please. It's Eloise.

430
00:27:51,970 --> 00:27:53,592
Eloise. 

431
00:27:53,738 --> 00:27:57,108
So, uh, what crisis forced Charles

432
00:27:57,108 --> 00:27:59,569
to send his best fix-it man

433
00:27:59,569 --> 00:28:02,421
into the bowels of charity balls?

434
00:28:02,421 --> 00:28:04,774
Well, Eloise, um...

435
00:28:04,774 --> 00:28:06,044
I'm deeply sorry,

436
00:28:06,044 --> 00:28:09,248
but it appears as if, uh, Drive Shaft

437
00:28:09,248 --> 00:28:11,484
won't be able to perform alongside your son.

438
00:28:11,484 --> 00:28:14,834
And, um, I take full responsibility... 

439
00:28:14,922 --> 00:28:16,944
Don't worry about it.

440
00:28:19,298 --> 00:28:20,294
Excuse me?

441
00:28:20,294 --> 00:28:22,286
Oh, my son will understand.

442
00:28:22,286 --> 00:28:25,988
I suppose if one employs so-called rock stars,

443
00:28:26,222 --> 00:28:30,422
a certain unpredictability comes with the territory.

444
00:28:30,796 --> 00:28:33,306
Yeah. Y... you're not angry?

445
00:28:33,306 --> 00:28:35,972
Oh, not at all, dear. 

446
00:28:36,383 --> 00:28:38,336
What happened, happened.

447
00:28:39,179 --> 00:28:41,396
Thank you so much, Mr. Hume,

448
00:28:41,396 --> 00:28:43,593
For coming and telling me in person.

449
00:28:43,593 --> 00:28:45,605
- A pleasure meeting you.
- And you. Thank you.

450
00:28:45,605 --> 00:28:48,877
Uh, center that flower arrangement, please.

451
00:28:48,877 --> 00:28:50,352
Have a good evening.

452
00:28:50,352 --> 00:28:52,051
Thank you.

453
00:28:52,207 --> 00:28:54,737
Leifer, Stephanie... plus two.

454
00:28:54,737 --> 00:28:56,641
Markey, Mary... plus one.

455
00:28:56,641 --> 00:28:58,829
Milton, Penny... solo.

456
00:28:59,425 --> 00:29:01,671
Pepper, Nicholas... plus one.

457
00:29:01,671 --> 00:29:03,019
Excuse me.

458
00:29:03,019 --> 00:29:04,758
I'm sorry. Um...

459
00:29:05,344 --> 00:29:07,082
Did you just say "Penny"?

460
00:29:07,082 --> 00:29:09,914
- And who are you?
- Um, I work for Mr. Widmore. May I see the list?

461
00:29:09,914 --> 00:29:12,629
You absolutely may not.

462
00:29:12,629 --> 00:29:14,671
That list is confidential.

463
00:29:14,671 --> 00:29:15,979
Begging your pardon,

464
00:29:15,979 --> 00:29:17,991
I... I'm entrusted with confidential items every day... 

465
00:29:17,991 --> 00:29:20,374
Are you questioning me?

466
00:29:20,804 --> 00:29:24,056
No, I... just want to look at one name on that list.

467
00:29:24,056 --> 00:29:26,791
- And if, for some reason, that's a problem...
- Come with me.

468
00:29:34,683 --> 00:29:36,909
Out, everyone. Now.

469
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:38,960
Look, I'm... 

470
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:40,504
I'm sorry if I've overstepped my bounds, but I just... 

471
00:29:40,504 --> 00:29:42,848
Stop talking, Hume.

472
00:29:42,848 --> 00:29:46,490
I've heard what you've had to say. Now you listen to me.

473
00:29:47,555 --> 00:29:49,997
I want you to stop.

474
00:29:50,485 --> 00:29:52,370
Stop? S... stop what?

475
00:29:52,370 --> 00:29:54,665
Someone has clearly affected the way you see things.

476
00:29:54,665 --> 00:29:59,519
This is a serious problem. It is, in fact, a violation.

477
00:29:59,519 --> 00:30:00,984
So whatever you're doing,

478
00:30:00,984 --> 00:30:04,129
whatever it is you think you're looking for...

479
00:30:05,145 --> 00:30:08,085
you need to stop looking for it.

480
00:30:10,073 --> 00:30:11,665
Do you... 

481
00:30:11,665 --> 00:30:14,917
do you know what I'm looking for, Mrs. Widmore?

482
00:30:14,917 --> 00:30:16,812
I don't know why you're looking for anything.

483
00:30:16,812 --> 00:30:18,473
You have the perfect life.

484
00:30:18,473 --> 00:30:20,465
On top of it, you've managed to attain

485
00:30:20,465 --> 00:30:23,278
the thing you wanted more than anything... 

486
00:30:23,278 --> 00:30:25,583
My husband's approval.

487
00:30:26,589 --> 00:30:29,069
How do you know what I want?

488
00:30:29,089 --> 00:30:31,882
Because I bloody do.

489
00:30:32,468 --> 00:30:34,949
I need to see that list...

490
00:30:35,261 --> 00:30:37,225
Or you need to tell me why I can't.

491
00:30:37,225 --> 00:30:41,913
You can't because you're not ready yet, Desmond.

492
00:30:43,622 --> 00:30:44,178
Ready?

493
00:30:44,178 --> 00:30:45,907
Ready? R... ready for what?

494
00:30:59,786 --> 00:31:01,446
That bad, huh?

495
00:31:04,718 --> 00:31:06,544
Is there any alcohol in this car?

496
00:31:07,013 --> 00:31:08,527
Oh, yeah.

497
00:31:08,527 --> 00:31:10,314
Whatever you need.

498
00:31:12,238 --> 00:31:13,820
So, uh...

499
00:31:14,035 --> 00:31:15,910
Where to, Mr. Hume?

500
00:31:17,932 --> 00:31:20,471
Just drive, George.

501
00:31:26,175 --> 00:31:28,119
- Mr. Hume.  - Yes?

502
00:31:28,119 --> 00:31:30,844
My name is Daniel. Daniel Widmore.

503
00:31:32,484 --> 00:31:34,457
We need to talk.

504
00:31:38,846 --> 00:31:40,712
Look, uh, Mr. Widmore, um...

505
00:31:40,712 --> 00:31:42,518
Dan. Please, call me Dan.

506
00:31:42,518 --> 00:31:44,286
"Mr. Widmore" is my father.

507
00:31:44,286 --> 00:31:46,640
Dan, um, look, if... if this is about Charlie Pace

508
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:48,134
not being able to perform with you,

509
00:31:48,134 --> 00:31:50,801
I'm... I'm very sorry.

510
00:31:50,849 --> 00:31:53,369
Do you believe in love at first sight, Mr. Hume?

511
00:31:57,413 --> 00:31:58,956
Excuse me?

512
00:31:59,942 --> 00:32:02,247
The first time I saw her, I was walking through this museum

513
00:32:02,247 --> 00:32:03,986
a few weeks ago.

514
00:32:04,142 --> 00:32:07,199
She... she works here. She was on her lunch break.

515
00:32:07,531 --> 00:32:09,494
She was eating a chocolate bar.

516
00:32:10,422 --> 00:32:14,084
She has these incredible blue, blue eyes, red hair.

517
00:32:14,319 --> 00:32:16,155
And as soon as I saw her,

518
00:32:16,155 --> 00:32:19,583
right... right in that moment, it was like...

519
00:32:21,028 --> 00:32:23,206
it was like I already loved her.

520
00:32:25,970 --> 00:32:28,168
And that's when things got weird.

521
00:32:31,252 --> 00:32:33,547
That same night after I saw that woman...

522
00:32:34,622 --> 00:32:36,849
I woke up and I wrote this.

523
00:32:43,031 --> 00:32:44,711
So what is it?

524
00:32:44,994 --> 00:32:47,690
I'm a musician. I have no idea.

525
00:32:47,690 --> 00:32:49,936
So I took it to a friend of mine at Caltech.

526
00:32:49,936 --> 00:32:53,755
He's a math whiz. He said this is quantum mechanics.

527
00:32:53,755 --> 00:32:56,802
He said these equations are so advanced that

528
00:32:56,802 --> 00:32:59,927
only someone who'd been studying physics their entire life

529
00:32:59,927 --> 00:33:01,714
could've come up with them.

530
00:33:01,851 --> 00:33:03,394
So...

531
00:33:03,891 --> 00:33:05,688
so what do they mean?

532
00:33:05,815 --> 00:33:09,614
Okay, imagine... imagine something terrible is about to happen,

533
00:33:09,614 --> 00:33:10,932
something catastrophic.

534
00:33:10,932 --> 00:33:13,247
And the only way to stop it from happening

535
00:33:13,247 --> 00:33:14,673
was by...

536
00:33:14,673 --> 00:33:17,505
releasing a huge amount of energy.

537
00:33:18,238 --> 00:33:20,787
Like setting off a nuclear bomb.

538
00:33:23,297 --> 00:33:25,055
You wanna set off a nuclear bomb?

539
00:33:25,055 --> 00:33:29,919
Just listen. What if this... all this...

540
00:33:30,046 --> 00:33:32,966
what if this wasn't supposed to be our life?

541
00:33:34,519 --> 00:33:37,879
What if we... we had some other life

542
00:33:37,879 --> 00:33:41,629
and for some reason, we changed things?

543
00:33:45,299 --> 00:33:48,249
I don't want to set off a nuclear bomb, Mr. Hume.

544
00:33:50,642 --> 00:33:52,615
I think I already did.

545
00:33:59,021 --> 00:34:00,867
Listen, mate, um...

546
00:34:00,867 --> 00:34:03,905
I don't know what any of this has to do with me. So...

547
00:34:03,905 --> 00:34:06,679
Why did you ask my mother about a woman named Penny?

548
00:34:11,913 --> 00:34:14,414
It happened to you, too, didn't it?

549
00:34:16,182 --> 00:34:17,607
You felt it.

550
00:34:18,047 --> 00:34:19,541
I don't know...

551
00:34:24,022 --> 00:34:25,966
I don't know what I felt.

552
00:34:25,966 --> 00:34:28,769
Yes, you do.

553
00:34:29,765 --> 00:34:31,650
You felt love.

554
00:34:32,685 --> 00:34:34,219
That's impossible because

555
00:34:34,219 --> 00:34:36,025
I don't know anything about this woman.

556
00:34:36,025 --> 00:34:38,975
I don't know... I don't know where she is.

557
00:34:38,975 --> 00:34:41,387
I don't even know if she exists.

558
00:34:41,895 --> 00:34:43,546
She's...

559
00:34:46,476 --> 00:34:48,253
She's an idea.

560
00:34:50,002 --> 00:34:52,473
No, Mr. Hume.

561
00:34:54,709 --> 00:34:56,955
She's my half-sister.

562
00:35:00,813 --> 00:35:04,456
And I can tell you exactly where and when you can find her.

563
00:35:55,417 --> 00:35:56,940
Excuse me?

564
00:35:58,767 --> 00:36:00,603
Yeah?

565
00:36:02,517 --> 00:36:04,207
Are you Penny?

566
00:36:05,955 --> 00:36:07,772
Uh, yes. 

567
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:11,503
Hello.

568
00:36:13,973 --> 00:36:15,653
I'm Desmond.

569
00:36:19,746 --> 00:36:21,611
Uh, hi.

570
00:36:26,121 --> 00:36:27,830
Checking in now.

571
00:36:36,034 --> 00:36:37,734
He's okay.

572
00:36:38,271 --> 00:36:40,342
Indeed he is.

573
00:36:43,594 --> 00:36:45,830
How are you, Desmond? How are you feeling?

574
00:36:47,647 --> 00:36:49,268
Fine.

575
00:36:51,915 --> 00:36:54,152
H... how long was I unconscious for?

576
00:36:54,152 --> 00:36:56,193
Oh, no more than a few seconds.

577
00:36:59,650 --> 00:37:01,613
Will you help me up, please?

578
00:37:04,903 --> 00:37:07,091
I'm really sorry we had to do this to you, Desmond.

579
00:37:07,091 --> 00:37:11,749
But as I told you, your... talent is vital to our mission.

580
00:37:11,749 --> 00:37:13,312
So if you just let me explain... 

581
00:37:13,312 --> 00:37:16,008
It's all right. I understand.

582
00:37:17,256 --> 00:37:19,053
What?

583
00:37:19,053 --> 00:37:21,475
I said I understand.

584
00:37:22,413 --> 00:37:23,936
You told me you brought me here to the island

585
00:37:23,936 --> 00:37:25,802
to do something very important.

586
00:37:25,802 --> 00:37:27,355
Yeah.

587
00:37:28,585 --> 00:37:30,363
When do we start?

588
00:37:42,444 --> 00:37:44,309
What happened to you?

589
00:37:45,022 --> 00:37:46,829
What do you mean?

590
00:37:46,868 --> 00:37:48,324
What I mean is 20 minutes ago,

591
00:37:48,324 --> 00:37:51,341
you were beating the crap out of Widmore with an I.V. Stand,

592
00:37:51,341 --> 00:37:54,555
and... and now you're Mr. Cooperative.

593
00:37:55,336 --> 00:37:57,690
A lot can happen in 20 minutes.

594
00:37:57,866 --> 00:37:59,799
Sure it can.

595
00:37:59,878 --> 00:38:01,987
That thing fried your brain.

596
00:38:04,292 --> 00:38:05,698
Did it?

597
00:38:05,698 --> 00:38:08,990
Whatever. Doesn't change that you're gonna... 

598
00:38:13,033 --> 00:38:14,713
Run.

599
00:38:19,235 --> 00:38:20,788
Desmond, I don't have time to explain,

600
00:38:20,788 --> 00:38:23,435
but these people are extremely dangerous.

601
00:38:23,552 --> 00:38:25,193
We need to go now.

602
00:38:26,951 --> 00:38:28,904
Aye, of course.

603
00:38:30,887 --> 00:38:32,879
Lead the way.

604
00:38:36,356 --> 00:38:38,602
Hello? You okay?

605
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:46,474
What happened?

606
00:38:46,474 --> 00:38:48,867
Well, I shook your hand, and then you fainted.

607
00:38:48,867 --> 00:38:50,977
I must have quite an effect on you. 

608
00:38:53,037 --> 00:38:55,128
Aye.

609
00:38:55,245 --> 00:38:57,052
Aye, you must have.

610
00:38:58,280 --> 00:39:00,380
Have we met before?

611
00:39:01,454 --> 00:39:04,160
I... I think we'd remember it if we have

612
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:05,820
Yeah.

613
00:39:06,279 --> 00:39:08,623
Well, as long as you're sure you're all right...

614
00:39:08,623 --> 00:39:10,342
Yeah, I'm fine.

615
00:39:10,342 --> 00:39:12,335
Hey, listen. Um...

616
00:39:12,618 --> 00:39:14,903
Would you like to go for a coffee?

617
00:39:16,251 --> 00:39:18,038
What, now?

618
00:39:18,038 --> 00:39:20,822
I'm a sweaty mess.

619
00:39:20,968 --> 00:39:23,302
I just fainted in front of you.

620
00:39:24,074 --> 00:39:26,027
I'd say we're even. 

621
00:39:29,319 --> 00:39:30,149
There's a coffee shop

622
00:39:30,149 --> 00:39:32,796
on the corner of Sweetzer and Melrose.

623
00:39:33,450 --> 00:39:35,482
I'll meet you there in an hour.

624
00:39:37,034 --> 00:39:39,046
Absolutely.

625
00:39:40,580 --> 00:39:43,090
- Okay.
- Okay.

626
00:40:16,042 --> 00:40:19,500
So... did you find what you were looking for?

627
00:40:23,283 --> 00:40:25,080
Yes, George, I did.

628
00:40:28,714 --> 00:40:30,647
Corner of Melrose and Sweetzer, please.

629
00:40:30,647 --> 00:40:31,937
You got it.

630
00:40:31,937 --> 00:40:34,496
And if there's anything else I can do for you, Mr. Hume,

631
00:40:34,496 --> 00:40:36,420
you just name it.

632
00:40:40,356 --> 00:40:42,768
Actually, there is one thing, George.

633
00:40:44,682 --> 00:40:47,632
Can you get me the manifest from my flight from Sydney?

634
00:40:47,632 --> 00:40:49,644
Oceanic 815.

635
00:40:49,644 --> 00:40:51,743
Just the names of the passengers.

636
00:40:52,525 --> 00:40:54,468
Sure, I can.

637
00:40:55,425 --> 00:40:57,887
Do you mind if I ask you what you need it for?

638
00:41:01,578 --> 00:41:03,991
I just need to show them something.
