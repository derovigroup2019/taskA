1
00:00:00,147 --> 00:00:02,106
Previously on Lost.

2
00:00:02,139 --> 00:00:04,373
- Who is he?
- His name is Richard Alpert.

3
00:00:04,406 --> 00:00:06,501
He's a kind of... advisor.

4
00:00:08,047 --> 00:00:12,219
And he has had that job
for a very, very long time.

5
00:00:12,499 --> 00:00:13,606
Why do you want to die?

6
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:15,445
I devoted my life...

7
00:00:16,241 --> 00:00:18,526
longer than you
can possibly imagine

8
00:00:18,939 --> 00:00:20,695
in service of a man,

9
00:00:20,735 --> 00:00:23,497
who told me that everything
was happening for a reason.

10
00:00:23,575 --> 00:00:26,729
That he had a plan a
plan that I was a part of...

11
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:29,741
and now that man's gone.
So why do I want to die?

12
00:00:29,742 --> 00:00:33,375
Because I just found out my
entire life had no purpose.

13
00:01:03,933 --> 00:01:06,439
I'm here because I need your help.

14
00:01:08,671 --> 00:01:10,676
Will you help me, Ilana?

15
00:01:12,673 --> 00:01:14,310
Yes.

16
00:01:15,886 --> 00:01:18,127
There's six people I
need you to protect.

17
00:01:18,966 --> 00:01:20,851
I'm gonna give you
a list of their names.

18
00:01:20,971 --> 00:01:24,052
This is what you've
been preparing for.

19
00:01:25,161 --> 00:01:27,690
These people... who are they?

20
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:29,661
They're the remaining candidates.

21
00:01:37,754 --> 00:01:39,184
Candidates?

22
00:01:39,304 --> 00:01:40,732
Candidates for what?

23
00:01:40,852 --> 00:01:42,867
To replace Jacob.

24
00:01:44,731 --> 00:01:46,455
She said I was one of them

25
00:01:46,986 --> 00:01:49,920
and so are you,
and so is Hurley.

26
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:55,368
Well, that's great. So
what do we do now?

27
00:01:56,325 --> 00:01:57,725
I don't know.

28
00:01:57,845 --> 00:01:59,134
Then who does?

29
00:02:01,857 --> 00:02:04,934
After I've brought
them to the temple...

30
00:02:09,278 --> 00:02:10,442
what do I do?

31
00:02:11,417 --> 00:02:12,803
Ask Ricardus.

32
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:15,633
He'll know what to do next.

33
00:02:16,554 --> 00:02:18,220
Who's Ricardus?

34
00:02:21,253 --> 00:02:22,921
He is.

35
00:02:24,292 --> 00:02:25,487
So, Richard...

36
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,687
What do we do next?

37
00:02:32,889 --> 00:02:35,554
I have no idea what "we" do next.

38
00:02:37,159 --> 00:02:38,604
You didn't tell your friends that

39
00:02:38,869 --> 00:02:41,493
I was trying to kill
myself when you found me?

40
00:02:44,202 --> 00:02:45,927
Does that sound like
someone who has a plan?

41
00:02:46,047 --> 00:02:48,063
Why would Jacob say you
knew what to do if...

42
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:49,941
Because everything
he ever said is a lie.

43
00:02:50,061 --> 00:02:51,696
What are you talking about?

44
00:02:54,448 --> 00:02:56,016
You wanna know a secret, Jack?

45
00:02:56,814 --> 00:02:59,330
Something I've known
a long, long time?

46
00:03:05,174 --> 00:03:06,385
You're dead.

47
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:11,796
- You mean that figuratively, right?
- No. I mean, literally.

48
00:03:11,829 --> 00:03:14,163
We're all dead... every
single one of us.

49
00:03:14,196 --> 00:03:17,297
And this... this... all this?
It's not what you think it is.

50
00:03:17,330 --> 00:03:19,796
We're not on an
island. We never were.

51
00:03:22,261 --> 00:03:23,497
We're in hell.

52
00:03:24,693 --> 00:03:26,918
So I'm not interested
in what Jacob said.

53
00:03:27,395 --> 00:03:30,118
In fact, maybe it's time
we stopped listening to him

54
00:03:30,325 --> 00:03:32,030
and we started listening
to someone else.

55
00:03:32,514 --> 00:03:34,392
And that's exactly
what I'm gonna do.

56
00:03:52,514 --> 00:03:55,392
Season 6 Episode 9
   "Ab Aeterno"

57
00:04:08,754 --> 00:04:10,229
What are you doing?

58
00:04:10,923 --> 00:04:14,187
- I'm going after Richard.
- Why? You heard him.

59
00:04:14,229 --> 00:04:16,107
He doesn't... he doesn't
know what we need to do next.

60
00:04:16,149 --> 00:04:19,869
He knows. Jacob
told me. He has to know.

61
00:04:19,989 --> 00:04:21,601
Alpert has lost his mind.

62
00:04:21,721 --> 00:04:23,563
He thinks that 
we're... we're in hell.

63
00:04:23,885 --> 00:04:25,070
And if he cared
about what Jacob said...

64
00:04:25,190 --> 00:04:28,282
he wouldn't be talking about...
about listening to someone else.

65
00:04:30,483 --> 00:04:31,290
Wait.

66
00:04:31,410 --> 00:04:32,642
You know who he meant?

67
00:04:32,762 --> 00:04:34,614
Oh, this should be interesting.

68
00:04:34,983 --> 00:04:36,238
What?

69
00:04:36,483 --> 00:04:38,173
He meant Locke.

70
00:04:43,265 --> 00:04:44,645
Locke is dead.

71
00:04:44,974 --> 00:04:48,326
If it's any consolation,
it's not exactly Locke.

72
00:04:57,273 --> 00:04:58,418
Hurley.

73
00:05:00,202 --> 00:05:01,235
What's he sayin'?

74
00:05:01,611 --> 00:05:03,141
Uh, wh... what's who saying?

75
00:05:03,261 --> 00:05:06,731
- Jacob. I saw you talking to him.
- I'm not talking to Jacob.

76
00:05:06,753 --> 00:05:09,419
Don't lie to me. Please,
if you something...

77
00:05:09,457 --> 00:05:11,722
- anything that can help us figure out...
- It's not Jacob, man.

78
00:05:13,872 --> 00:05:15,130
Then who is it?

79
00:05:15,422 --> 00:05:17,749
Sorry, Jack, but this has
nothing to do with you.

80
00:05:26,390 --> 00:05:29,263
- Shephard is right, you know.
- Right about what?

81
00:05:29,383 --> 00:05:30,064
Richard.

82
00:05:31,059 --> 00:05:33,506
Going after him is a waste of
time. He doesn't know anything.

83
00:05:36,706 --> 00:05:40,320
- What makes you so sure?
- I've known him since I was 12 years old.

84
00:05:40,359 --> 00:05:41,608
That should count for something.

85
00:05:41,728 --> 00:05:43,185
So you guys met when
you were kids, huh?

86
00:05:43,305 --> 00:05:44,725
No, Frank, I was a kid.

87
00:05:46,252 --> 00:05:48,774
Richard looked just
like he does today.

88
00:05:48,808 --> 00:05:50,699
You're saying this guy doesn't age?

89
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:52,375
That's exactly what I'm saying.

90
00:05:53,292 --> 00:05:55,641
And how the hell do
you think that happened?

91
00:12:28,244 --> 00:12:31,587
In nomine patris et
filii et spiritus sancti.

92
00:12:31,707 --> 00:12:32,601
Amen.

93
00:12:51,383 --> 00:12:52,683
No.

94
00:14:23,388 --> 00:14:25,341
- Is this him?
- Yes.

95
00:14:35,956 --> 00:14:37,581
Calm down!

96
00:14:39,102 --> 00:14:40,482
You say he speaks English.

97
00:14:40,602 --> 00:14:42,050
Yes, Mr. Whitfield.

98
00:14:47,572 --> 00:14:49,009
Do you speak English?

99
00:14:50,962 --> 00:14:52,616
I asked, do you speak English?

100
00:14:57,572 --> 00:14:59,488
Take him away and bring me another.

101
00:15:00,626 --> 00:15:03,632
- Hang him.
- Yes, I speak it! Yes, I speak it!

102
00:15:03,752 --> 00:15:04,766
Wait.

103
00:15:07,590 --> 00:15:10,043
You have strong hands. What
sort of work did you do?

104
00:15:10,044 --> 00:15:13,710
I... I work... I work...
i... in the fields.

105
00:15:13,743 --> 00:15:16,093
I understand you're interested
in going to the new world.

106
00:15:16,243 --> 00:15:18,757
- Yes.
- Well, then...

107
00:15:19,482 --> 00:15:21,977
- This is your lucky day.
- Thank you, father.

108
00:15:22,518 --> 00:15:25,720
This man is now the property
of Captain Magnus Hanso.

109
00:15:27,847 --> 00:15:29,677
I hope you don't get seasick.

110
00:17:24,878 --> 00:17:26,343
Do you see anything?!

111
00:17:29,378 --> 00:17:32,853
- Bring me the Captain.
- Sir, Captain Hanso's dead.

112
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:36,170
Good God, we're in the
middle of a bloody jungle!

113
00:18:03,487 --> 00:18:05,339
Thank God. Thanks.

114
00:18:06,037 --> 00:18:07,786
Thank you very much.

115
00:18:10,129 --> 00:18:13,295
No! Stop! No!

116
00:18:14,223 --> 00:18:15,829
No! Stop!

117
00:18:16,623 --> 00:18:18,029
No, No No!

118
00:18:18,223 --> 00:18:21,229
No! Stop! Stop!

119
00:18:21,537 --> 00:18:23,489
What are you doing?

120
00:18:23,537 --> 00:18:24,689
Aah!

121
00:18:25,675 --> 00:18:26,811
I'm begging you.

122
00:18:27,515 --> 00:18:29,149
Don't do it.

123
00:18:29,511 --> 00:18:31,067
Don't do it, please.

124
00:18:31,187 --> 00:18:34,156
We are shipwrecked in
the middle of the jungle.

125
00:18:35,377 --> 00:18:37,010
We have no fresh water

126
00:18:37,474 --> 00:18:39,138
and limited supplies,

127
00:18:39,774 --> 00:18:41,511
and there are only five officers left.

128
00:18:42,084 --> 00:18:43,976
No! No! No!

129
00:18:52,424 --> 00:18:53,691
Why... why are you doing this?

130
00:18:53,811 --> 00:18:55,522
Because if I freed you,

131
00:18:56,180 --> 00:18:57,776
it would only be a matter of time

132
00:18:57,896 --> 00:18:59,465
before you tried to kill me.

133
00:19:03,409 --> 00:19:04,349
No!

134
00:19:10,609 --> 00:19:13,849
Shoot it! Shoot!

135
00:19:22,459 --> 00:19:23,626
Aah!

136
00:19:27,991 --> 00:19:29,456
What happened up there?

137
00:19:35,802 --> 00:19:37,226
I said report!

138
00:24:41,121 --> 00:24:42,999
Isabella!

139
00:24:43,699 --> 00:24:44,980
Isabella!

140
00:25:43,393 --> 00:25:45,196
Shh. Here.

141
00:25:46,003 --> 00:25:47,304
Water.

142
00:26:07,206 --> 00:26:09,071
Who...

143
00:26:09,104 --> 00:26:12,077
Who... who are you?

144
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:13,950
A friend.

145
00:26:14,070 --> 00:26:15,555
I am...

146
00:26:16,626 --> 00:26:18,118
In hell?

147
00:26:19,112 --> 00:26:20,877
Yes, I'm afraid you are.

148
00:26:22,004 --> 00:26:23,346
You...

149
00:26:23,985 --> 00:26:26,514
you were not on this ship.

150
00:26:30,731 --> 00:26:32,187
I was here...

151
00:26:32,853 --> 00:26:34,481
long before your ship.

152
00:26:35,847 --> 00:26:37,756
Did you see my... my wife?

153
00:26:38,132 --> 00:26:40,114
- I'm sorry?
- Isabella. My wife.

154
00:26:40,613 --> 00:26:43,013
She was here. She was...

155
00:26:43,222 --> 00:26:47,547
but... then the black smoke came,

156
00:26:47,581 --> 00:26:49,655
and she ran.

157
00:26:50,387 --> 00:26:51,814
And she hasn't come back?

158
00:26:56,206 --> 00:26:57,891
That probably means he has her.

159
00:26:58,011 --> 00:26:59,065
Who?

160
00:27:00,835 --> 00:27:02,187
I think you know who.

161
00:27:02,739 --> 00:27:05,262
If she's a... alive, I must save her.

162
00:27:05,291 --> 00:27:06,577
Please. Please, help me.

163
00:27:06,697 --> 00:27:09,015
Of course. Of... of course I'll help.

164
00:27:10,372 --> 00:27:12,092
I want to be free, too.

165
00:27:13,359 --> 00:27:15,325
As luck would have it...

166
00:27:16,818 --> 00:27:19,203
I found these on one
of the officers outside.

167
00:27:19,231 --> 00:27:20,480
I think they'll work.

168
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:25,772
But before I try, I need to
know that you will help me.

169
00:27:25,799 --> 00:27:27,539
Yes. Yes. Of... of course.

170
00:27:27,564 --> 00:27:28,731
You'll do anything I ask?

171
00:27:28,732 --> 00:27:30,766
Yes. Yes, anything. Yes, I promise.

172
00:27:31,075 --> 00:27:33,070
Then we're agreed.

173
00:27:53,848 --> 00:27:54,759
Thank you.

174
00:27:54,879 --> 00:27:56,317
Of course, my friend.

175
00:27:58,139 --> 00:28:00,337
It's good to see you
out of those chains.

176
00:28:00,954 --> 00:28:02,288
Thank you.

177
00:28:05,243 --> 00:28:07,497
We're gonna have to
get you on your feet.

178
00:28:14,742 --> 00:28:17,249
You're gonna need your strength
if we're going to escape.

179
00:28:17,756 --> 00:28:18,695
Escape?

180
00:28:19,681 --> 00:28:21,200
That's right.

181
00:28:21,641 --> 00:28:24,758
I'm afraid there's only
one way to escape from hell.

182
00:28:25,143 --> 00:28:27,278
You're going to
have to kill the devil.

183
00:28:39,523 --> 00:28:40,997
When you're finished eating,

184
00:28:41,758 --> 00:28:43,505
you'll walk due west.

185
00:28:44,519 --> 00:28:45,878
Once you get to the ocean,

186
00:28:46,244 --> 00:28:48,160
you'll be able to see the statue.

187
00:28:49,764 --> 00:28:50,546
The statue?

188
00:28:50,666 --> 00:28:52,940
Your ship smashed through
it on its way inland.

189
00:28:53,353 --> 00:28:54,621
Broke it into pieces.

190
00:28:55,351 --> 00:28:57,131
That's where you'll find the devil.

191
00:29:03,007 --> 00:29:04,530
You only have one chance.

192
00:29:05,523 --> 00:29:06,617
Put this through his chest.

193
00:29:06,655 --> 00:29:08,674
Do not hesitate, do
not let him say a word.

194
00:29:09,293 --> 00:29:11,498
If he speaks, it will
already be too late.

195
00:29:12,702 --> 00:29:14,118
He can be very persuasive.

196
00:29:15,569 --> 00:29:17,081
How... how can I
kill him with this?

197
00:29:17,118 --> 00:29:18,862
He... he's... black smoke.

198
00:29:18,982 --> 00:29:19,936
No.

199
00:29:21,121 --> 00:29:22,244
I am.

200
00:29:28,979 --> 00:29:30,641
My wife Isabella...

201
00:29:31,345 --> 00:29:32,979
She was running from you?

202
00:29:33,599 --> 00:29:34,885
She was running from him.

203
00:29:36,332 --> 00:29:39,532
I'm sorry. I saw him take her,

204
00:29:39,572 --> 00:29:41,478
but I couldn't do
anything to stop him.

205
00:29:43,857 --> 00:29:46,220
But... but if you are
the black smoke, you...

206
00:29:46,253 --> 00:29:48,620
You aren't the only one who's
lost something, my friend.

207
00:29:48,911 --> 00:29:50,338
The devil betrayed me.

208
00:29:51,165 --> 00:29:52,253
He took my body,

209
00:29:53,502 --> 00:29:54,719
my humanity.

210
00:29:55,969 --> 00:29:58,176
You... you killed the
officers on the ship.

211
00:29:58,204 --> 00:29:59,922
I'm not the one you
need to worry about.

212
00:30:00,514 --> 00:30:02,153
The devil has your wife,

213
00:30:02,186 --> 00:30:03,629
and you are going
to have to kill him

214
00:30:03,657 --> 00:30:05,291
if you ever want to get her back.

215
00:30:09,619 --> 00:30:12,389
Murder is wrong. That
is what brought me here.

216
00:30:12,426 --> 00:30:13,128
My friend...

217
00:30:14,736 --> 00:30:19,384
You and I can talk all day long
about what's right or wrong.

218
00:30:19,619 --> 00:30:22,121
But the question before
you remains the same.

219
00:30:24,860 --> 00:30:27,133
Do you ever want to
see your wife again?

220
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:35,912
Yes, I do.

221
00:32:07,211 --> 00:32:10,141
What are you doing
here? Who gave you this?!

222
00:32:10,675 --> 00:32:12,201
Where is my wife?

223
00:32:13,009 --> 00:32:14,408
What?

224
00:32:14,781 --> 00:32:15,908
Where is my wife?

225
00:32:16,170 --> 00:32:17,741
I... I don't know your wife.

226
00:32:17,774 --> 00:32:21,260
- Did she come here on the ship?
- No. She's dead.

227
00:32:21,380 --> 00:32:23,166
Then why are you
asking me where she is?

228
00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:31,125
Did you meet a man in the
jungle dressed in black?

229
00:32:33,482 --> 00:32:34,632
Yes.

230
00:32:35,568 --> 00:32:36,998
What did he tell you?

231
00:32:37,031 --> 00:32:39,498
He said you are the devil.

232
00:32:41,740 --> 00:32:42,435
And?

233
00:32:42,555 --> 00:32:45,387
He said the only way I
would see my wife again

234
00:32:45,388 --> 00:32:46,910
is if I kill you.

235
00:32:47,388 --> 00:32:49,163
I... I saw her here...

236
00:32:49,717 --> 00:32:51,501
in this place. Where is she?!

237
00:32:51,540 --> 00:32:53,095
- That wasn't your wife.
- Yes, it was!

238
00:32:53,351 --> 00:32:56,746
- She is dead, just like me.
- You're not dead.

239
00:32:56,769 --> 00:32:59,179
I... I am in hell. I
know that I am in hell!

240
00:32:59,213 --> 00:33:01,717
- You really think you're dead?
- Where else would I be?

241
00:33:04,553 --> 00:33:05,633
All right then.

242
00:33:06,046 --> 00:33:07,567
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

243
00:33:08,613 --> 00:33:10,613
No, no, no, no!

244
00:33:17,299 --> 00:33:19,205
- Still think you're dead?!
- Aah!

245
00:33:21,632 --> 00:33:22,613
Aah!

246
00:33:26,248 --> 00:33:27,619
- Still think you're dead?
- Stop!

247
00:33:28,914 --> 00:33:30,567
Why should I stop?!

248
00:33:30,943 --> 00:33:32,642
Because I want to live!

249
00:33:40,925 --> 00:33:43,066
That's the first sensible
thing you've said.

250
00:33:43,714 --> 00:33:44,963
What's your name?

251
00:33:45,083 --> 00:33:46,127
Ricardo.

252
00:33:46,247 --> 00:33:47,432
Ricardo.

253
00:33:48,286 --> 00:33:50,017
Get up. We need to talk.

254
00:34:14,365 --> 00:34:15,304
What is inside?

255
00:34:15,342 --> 00:34:17,295
No one comes in
unless I invite them in.

256
00:34:30,233 --> 00:34:31,445
Are you the devil?

257
00:34:37,420 --> 00:34:38,701
No.

258
00:34:41,801 --> 00:34:43,302
Then who are you?

259
00:34:43,894 --> 00:34:45,236
My name is Jacob.

260
00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:48,448
I'm the one who brought
your ship to this island.

261
00:34:52,180 --> 00:34:53,673
You brought it here?

262
00:34:55,874 --> 00:34:57,268
Why?

263
00:35:08,341 --> 00:35:11,196
Think of this wine as what
you keep calling "hell."

264
00:35:11,449 --> 00:35:13,449
There's many other
names for it, too.

265
00:35:13,872 --> 00:35:14,982
"Malevolence."

266
00:35:15,788 --> 00:35:16,840
"Evil."

267
00:35:17,281 --> 00:35:18,088
"Darkness."

268
00:35:18,855 --> 00:35:21,933
And here it is, swirling
around in the bottle,

269
00:35:21,961 --> 00:35:22,882
unable to get out,

270
00:35:22,919 --> 00:35:25,747
because if it did,
it would spread.

271
00:35:28,404 --> 00:35:29,719
The cork...

272
00:35:30,588 --> 00:35:31,893
is this island.

273
00:35:33,310 --> 00:35:35,864
And it's the only thing
keeping the darkness...

274
00:35:37,582 --> 00:35:39,460
where it belongs.

275
00:35:46,446 --> 00:35:48,093
That man who sent you to kill me

276
00:35:48,117 --> 00:35:49,589
believes that everyone is corruptible

277
00:35:49,619 --> 00:35:52,369
because it's in their
very nature to sin.

278
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:55,315
I bring people here
to prove him wrong.

279
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:59,979
And when they get here,
their past doesn't matter.

280
00:36:00,578 --> 00:36:02,907
Before you brought my
ship, there were others?

281
00:36:03,279 --> 00:36:04,336
Yes. Many.

282
00:36:04,456 --> 00:36:06,350
- What happened to them?
- They're all dead.

283
00:36:07,700 --> 00:36:09,933
But if you brought them here,
why didn't you help them?

284
00:36:09,961 --> 00:36:11,822
Because I wanted them
to help themselves...

285
00:36:14,062 --> 00:36:16,184
To know the difference
between right and wrong

286
00:36:16,222 --> 00:36:17,683
without me having to tell them.

287
00:36:18,256 --> 00:36:21,420
It's all meaningless if I have
to force them to do anything.

288
00:36:21,938 --> 00:36:23,234
Why should I have to step in?

289
00:36:23,354 --> 00:36:24,849
If you don't, he will.

290
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:37,366
Do you want a job?

291
00:36:37,958 --> 00:36:40,257
What, a job?

292
00:36:43,209 --> 00:36:44,552
Doing what?

293
00:36:44,852 --> 00:36:46,054
Well...

294
00:36:46,533 --> 00:36:48,007
if I don't want to step in,

295
00:36:49,135 --> 00:36:50,756
maybe you can do it for me.

296
00:36:51,473 --> 00:36:54,218
You can be my...
my representative...

297
00:36:54,219 --> 00:36:56,129
an intermediary between
me and the people

298
00:36:56,157 --> 00:36:59,256
- I bring to the island.
- Well, what will I get in return?

299
00:36:59,284 --> 00:37:01,403
- You tell me.
- I want my wife back.

300
00:37:04,023 --> 00:37:05,731
Can't do that.

301
00:37:10,609 --> 00:37:13,968
Can you absolve me of my
sins so I don't go to hell?

302
00:37:14,006 --> 00:37:15,424
I can't do that either.

303
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:25,750
Then I never want to die.
I... I want to live forever.

304
00:37:27,046 --> 00:37:28,395
Now that...

305
00:37:29,926 --> 00:37:31,375
I can do.

306
00:37:54,857 --> 00:37:56,810
You let him talk to you, didn't you?

307
00:38:02,014 --> 00:38:04,080
He told me to give you this.

308
00:38:09,567 --> 00:38:11,293
I'm sure you realize
that if you go with him,

309
00:38:11,539 --> 00:38:13,473
you'll never be with
your wife again.

310
00:38:16,852 --> 00:38:18,176
I understand.

311
00:38:19,838 --> 00:38:21,735
He can be very...

312
00:38:21,979 --> 00:38:23,256
convincing.

313
00:38:26,282 --> 00:38:28,695
But I want you to know if
you ever change your mind...

314
00:38:28,815 --> 00:38:30,206
and I mean ever,

315
00:38:31,408 --> 00:38:33,197
my offer still stands.

316
00:38:40,192 --> 00:38:42,023
I have something for you.

317
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:47,900
You must have dropped it.

318
00:38:49,788 --> 00:38:51,377
I found it on the ship.

319
00:40:24,677 --> 00:40:26,405
I've changed my mind.

320
00:40:31,796 --> 00:40:33,139
Are you listening to me?

321
00:40:34,472 --> 00:40:35,909
I've changed my mind.

322
00:40:42,391 --> 00:40:43,837
I was wrong!

323
00:40:44,405 --> 00:40:46,505
You said I could
change my mind.

324
00:40:47,058 --> 00:40:48,943
You said the offer would stand!

325
00:40:51,356 --> 00:40:53,450
Does the offer still stand?

326
00:40:54,727 --> 00:40:56,505
Does the offer still stand?

327
00:40:57,511 --> 00:41:00,306
Does the offer still stand?

328
00:41:14,198 --> 00:41:15,653
What offer, dude?

329
00:41:15,888 --> 00:41:19,221
What the hell are you doing
out here? Did you follow me?

330
00:41:19,341 --> 00:41:21,353
- Well, kinda.
- Get... get out! Get out!

331
00:41:21,387 --> 00:41:22,178
Hey!

332
00:41:22,298 --> 00:41:24,309
- Did... didn't you hear what I said?
- I was just...

333
00:41:24,328 --> 00:41:25,111
I told you people, I
don't know anything!

334
00:41:25,128 --> 00:41:26,411
Dude, just calm down!

335
00:41:26,551 --> 00:41:28,598
- Why did you follow me?
- Your wife sent me!

336
00:41:32,620 --> 00:41:33,893
What did you say?

337
00:41:34,203 --> 00:41:36,087
I said your wife sent me.

338
00:41:36,803 --> 00:41:37,887
Isabella.

339
00:41:40,361 --> 00:41:42,558
She wants to know why
you buried her cross.

340
00:41:43,243 --> 00:41:45,009
H-how do you know about that?

341
00:41:46,251 --> 00:41:49,472
- Because she just told me.
- What do you mean, "just told you"?

342
00:41:49,848 --> 00:41:51,960
Isabella saw you dig it up, man.

343
00:41:52,486 --> 00:41:54,003
She's standing right next to you.

344
00:42:17,780 --> 00:42:19,611
I... I... I don't see her.

345
00:42:23,641 --> 00:42:25,191
She's right there.

346
00:42:26,750 --> 00:42:28,608
She says your English is awesome.

347
00:42:43,027 --> 00:42:44,667
Close your eyes.

348
00:42:45,196 --> 00:42:47,196
She wants you to close your eyes.

349
00:42:49,492 --> 00:42:51,314
It's okay. I'll tell
you what she says.

350
00:43:01,483 --> 00:43:04,074
It was not your fault
that I died, Ricardo.

351
00:43:59,927 --> 00:44:01,354
Is she gone?

352
00:44:02,922 --> 00:44:04,387
Yeah.

353
00:44:23,129 --> 00:44:24,827
Thank you.

354
00:44:26,393 --> 00:44:27,830
Yeah, you got it.

355
00:44:30,719 --> 00:44:31,827
Something wrong?

356
00:44:34,100 --> 00:44:36,227
Well, she kinda said
one more thing.

357
00:44:37,064 --> 00:44:38,642
Something you have to do.

358
00:44:39,402 --> 00:44:40,393
What?

359
00:44:41,977 --> 00:44:44,393
She said you have to
stop the man in black.

360
00:44:45,198 --> 00:44:47,127
You have to stop him
from leaving the island.

361
00:44:48,153 --> 00:44:49,693
'Cause if you don't...

362
00:45:36,076 --> 00:45:38,474
- Good morning.
- Morning

363
00:45:43,076 --> 00:45:44,850
I see you got my present.

364
00:45:47,076 --> 00:45:49,874
Don't gloat, Jacob.
It doesn't become you.

365
00:45:51,258 --> 00:45:53,233
So you try to kill me?

366
00:45:54,806 --> 00:45:55,969
You expect an apology?

367
00:45:56,173 --> 00:45:56,681
No.

368
00:45:58,063 --> 00:45:59,615
I guess I'm just wondering
why you did it.

369
00:45:59,644 --> 00:46:00,787
Because I wanna leave.

370
00:46:01,731 --> 00:46:03,474
Just let me leave, Jacob.

371
00:46:04,846 --> 00:46:06,763
As long as I'm alive,
you're not going anywhere.

372
00:46:06,802 --> 00:46:08,474
Well, then, now you know
why I wanna kill you.

373
00:46:09,149 --> 00:46:10,653
And I will kill you, Jacob.

374
00:46:11,474 --> 00:46:13,353
Even if you do, somebody
else will take my place.

375
00:46:13,473 --> 00:46:15,151
Well, then I'll kill them too.

376
00:46:21,237 --> 00:46:22,474
Here,

377
00:46:24,981 --> 00:46:26,868
something for you
to pass the time.

378
00:46:32,474 --> 00:46:34,153
I'll see you around.

379
00:46:39,515 --> 00:46:41,475
Sooner than you think.
