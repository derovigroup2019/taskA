1
00:00:00,107 --> 00:00:01,545
<i>Previously on "Lost"...</i>

2
00:00:01,645 --> 00:00:03,194
<i>If we can do what Faraday said,</i>

3
00:00:03,294 --> 00:00:05,099
our plane never crashes.

4
00:00:05,199 --> 00:00:07,549
Come on, you son of a bitch!

5
00:00:19,773 --> 00:00:22,419
It's the Swan hatch...
After Desmond blew it up.

6
00:00:22,627 --> 00:00:24,370
They built it?

7
00:00:24,470 --> 00:00:25,461
You were wrong!

8
00:00:25,561 --> 00:00:27,911
You said we could stop it
from ever gettin' built!

9
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:28,965
That our plane would never

10
00:00:28,986 --> 00:00:30,456
- crash on this island!
- Stop it!

11
00:00:30,531 --> 00:00:32,881
- I thought it would work.
- Well, it didn't!

12
00:00:57,075 --> 00:00:59,425
Help...

13
00:01:00,650 --> 00:01:02,806
Juliet!

14
00:01:02,906 --> 00:01:06,296
- Juliet?
- I have to tell you something.

15
00:01:06,866 --> 00:01:09,282
It's really, really important.

16
00:01:10,095 --> 00:01:12,445
You tell me.

17
00:01:14,183 --> 00:01:16,533
Tell me.

18
00:01:23,864 --> 00:01:26,214
You did this.

19
00:01:55,479 --> 00:01:57,829
We gonna sing "kumbaya" on the way?

20
00:01:58,042 --> 00:01:59,715
It's not a guitar, man.

21
00:01:59,815 --> 00:02:02,165
Then what is it?

22
00:02:06,512 --> 00:02:08,151
You going with them?

23
00:02:08,251 --> 00:02:10,820
No, I'm gonna bury her.

24
00:02:11,122 --> 00:02:13,347
Let me help you.

25
00:02:13,447 --> 00:02:15,797
Help Sayid.

26
00:02:18,832 --> 00:02:20,716
Hey, Miles.

27
00:02:20,816 --> 00:02:23,166
You mind hangin' back?

28
00:02:23,889 --> 00:02:25,815
You got it, boss.

29
00:02:25,915 --> 00:02:28,265
I'll make sure to leave
a trail so you can follow us.

30
00:02:29,165 --> 00:02:31,515
I ain't followin' nobody, Kate.

31
00:02:39,562 --> 00:02:41,912
You guys ready?

32
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:44,600
Whenever you are.

33
00:03:35,001 --> 00:03:37,906
That's a big wall.

34
00:03:38,637 --> 00:03:40,987
How are we gonna get him over the top?

35
00:03:42,434 --> 00:03:44,222
We're not.

36
00:03:44,322 --> 00:03:46,672
We're bringing him in through here.

37
00:04:18,970 --> 00:04:21,706
Who brings a book into a cave?

38
00:04:28,142 --> 00:04:30,492
And why is his arm missing?

39
00:04:31,221 --> 00:04:34,426
It was ripped off when he was
attacked by the black smoke.

40
00:04:38,090 --> 00:04:41,162
Well... This is gonna be awesome.

41
00:05:02,916 --> 00:05:05,266
- Now watch your step.
- Yeah.

42
00:05:11,792 --> 00:05:14,142
Okay.

43
00:06:00,136 --> 00:06:02,486
Where's Kate?

44
00:06:02,536 --> 00:06:04,886
She's right over there.

45
00:06:05,304 --> 00:06:07,902
Kate?

46
00:06:10,447 --> 00:06:12,797
Kate!

47
00:06:13,656 --> 00:06:16,312
Can you hear me?!

48
00:06:18,313 --> 00:06:20,663
Kate!

49
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:24,392
Jack! We can't leave Say...

50
00:06:24,492 --> 00:06:26,842
Hey! Let...

51
00:06:26,932 --> 00:06:28,314
Hurley?

52
00:06:28,414 --> 00:06:30,764
Jin!

53
00:06:31,609 --> 00:06:33,959
Hurley!

54
00:07:09,605 --> 00:07:12,708
- Anything to declare?
- Just a murderer.

55
00:07:17,758 --> 00:07:20,108
Okay.

56
00:07:20,650 --> 00:07:21,814
I need to go to the bathroom.

57
00:07:21,914 --> 00:07:23,688
- Hold it.
- I can't hold it.

58
00:07:23,788 --> 00:07:25,836
Sure you can, kiddo.
I believe in you.

59
00:07:25,936 --> 00:07:28,038
Edward...

60
00:07:28,138 --> 00:07:30,488
Please.

61
00:07:31,790 --> 00:07:34,140
All right. Come on.

62
00:07:35,446 --> 00:07:37,626
Anybody in here?

63
00:07:37,726 --> 00:07:40,076
Is anybody in the ladies' room?

64
00:07:40,308 --> 00:07:42,658
Don't move.

65
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:47,003
Okay.

66
00:07:47,103 --> 00:07:49,583
- You got two minutes.
- Thank you.

67
00:08:21,426 --> 00:08:22,638
You done?

68
00:08:22,738 --> 00:08:25,088
Not yet.

69
00:08:38,020 --> 00:08:39,644
All right, time's up! Get out of there.

70
00:08:39,744 --> 00:08:41,856
- One minute.
- No, open this door right now.

71
00:08:41,956 --> 00:08:45,640
- I'm not finished.
- Yes, you are. Open it.

72
00:08:46,024 --> 00:08:50,964
Austen, I swear to god, if you don't open
this door, I'm coming in there... oh!

73
00:09:06,567 --> 00:09:09,692
Although I've seen it before,
it was something... Oh, my god.

74
00:09:09,812 --> 00:09:12,799
I, uh, he... he just
walked in here and attacked me.

75
00:09:13,063 --> 00:09:17,555
I shed h. I-just...
I need to get out of here.

76
00:09:23,953 --> 00:09:26,654
Officer, come quick. Come quick.

77
00:09:26,958 --> 00:09:29,373
Wait, hold the door!

78
00:09:33,749 --> 00:09:36,099
Welcome aboard.

79
00:09:38,355 --> 00:09:41,411
We were on the same flight. Sydney.

80
00:09:41,779 --> 00:09:44,129
How about that?

81
00:09:58,234 --> 00:10:00,584
Ganson, Calhoun, what's your 20?

82
00:10:00,883 --> 00:10:03,928
Uh, we're on theouth elevator, headed to ground.

83
00:10:04,048 --> 00:10:05,996
Get your asses to international baggage claim.

84
00:10:06,096 --> 00:10:09,650
- We got a 341.
- Yeah. We're on our way.

85
00:10:09,770 --> 00:10:11,154
Sounds serious.

86
00:10:11,254 --> 00:10:13,367
What's a 341?

87
00:10:13,467 --> 00:10:14,616
That's confidential, sir.

88
00:10:14,716 --> 00:10:18,751
Well, if it's confidential, how the hell
am I supposed to know if I see one?

89
00:10:20,793 --> 00:10:23,820
Uh, sorry.
Excuse me. Ladies first.

90
00:10:24,492 --> 00:10:25,512
Thanks.

91
00:10:25,612 --> 00:10:28,316
Take care.

92
00:10:40,534 --> 00:10:43,670
- I think that'll do it, boss.
- Stop calling me "boss".

93
00:10:44,690 --> 00:10:46,734
You ain't my deputy anymore.

94
00:10:46,834 --> 00:10:49,184
You got it.

95
00:10:50,617 --> 00:10:53,174
Are you thirsty? I think I saw
some beers in the van.

96
00:10:53,383 --> 00:10:54,586
Construction guys hid 'em
in the wheel well.

97
00:10:54,686 --> 00:10:57,036
What did she want to tell me, Miles?

98
00:10:57,515 --> 00:10:58,711
Excuse me?

99
00:10:58,811 --> 00:11:01,161
Juliet.

100
00:11:01,464 --> 00:11:04,181
She said she wanted to tell me
something, and then she died.

101
00:11:04,215 --> 00:11:06,565
What was it, Miles?

102
00:11:06,634 --> 00:11:08,984
That's why you asked me
to stay here with you?

103
00:11:09,489 --> 00:11:12,173
You're the only one around
that talks to dead people.

104
00:11:14,343 --> 00:11:16,056
Jim,

105
00:11:16,156 --> 00:11:17,560
that's not how it works.

106
00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:19,486
What did she wanna tell me, Miles?

107
00:11:19,586 --> 00:11:22,293
- It... it doesn't matter.
- It does matter.

108
00:11:22,304 --> 00:11:24,145
- It's not gonna help.
- Just do it.

109
00:11:24,245 --> 00:11:26,733
- Just ask her...
- She's gone, James.

110
00:11:29,009 --> 00:11:31,817
I know she's gone. I know.

111
00:11:33,573 --> 00:11:35,923
Now tell me.

112
00:11:36,676 --> 00:11:39,026
Okay.

113
00:11:40,711 --> 00:11:42,291
Okay.

114
00:11:42,391 --> 00:11:45,217
All right.
All right.

115
00:12:12,804 --> 00:12:14,562
What?

116
00:12:14,662 --> 00:12:17,012
It worked.

117
00:12:18,097 --> 00:12:19,789
What did she want to tell me?

118
00:12:19,889 --> 00:12:22,239
That's what she wanted to tell you.

119
00:12:23,521 --> 00:12:25,871
It worked.

120
00:12:34,902 --> 00:12:37,252
What worked?

121
00:13:01,273 --> 00:13:02,377
You okay?

122
00:13:02,477 --> 00:13:04,827
- Yeah. You?
- Yeah.

123
00:13:26,249 --> 00:13:29,025
Guess we found the temple.

124
00:13:38,933 --> 00:13:41,121
Oceanic passenger Jack Shephard...

125
00:13:41,221 --> 00:13:44,799
Jack Shephard, please go to
the nearest courtesy desk.

126
00:13:48,517 --> 00:13:49,937
Hi. Uh...

127
00:13:50,037 --> 00:13:52,564
I'm Jack Shephard. I was just paged.

128
00:13:52,565 --> 00:13:54,545
Oh, Mr. Shephard.

129
00:13:54,645 --> 00:13:56,604
Hello. Yes, that was me.

130
00:13:56,704 --> 00:13:58,540
Uh, sorry, I meant
to meet you at the gate.

131
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:00,990
Well, um, I'm here now, so...

132
00:14:01,072 --> 00:14:02,935
Yes. Mr. Shephard, I am deeply sorry,

133
00:14:03,035 --> 00:14:04,365
But there seems to have been a mix-up

134
00:14:04,465 --> 00:14:08,366
involving the, uh... cargo
you checked in Sydney.

135
00:14:08,702 --> 00:14:09,520
Cargo?

136
00:14:09,582 --> 00:14:11,932
Yes, sir. A coffin.

137
00:14:12,946 --> 00:14:14,302
I don't...

138
00:14:14,402 --> 00:14:17,410
I don't understand. I mean, are... are
you saying that it's not here?

139
00:14:18,114 --> 00:14:20,464
It appears it was never
put on the plane.

140
00:14:23,792 --> 00:14:26,751
The funeral is in two hours.
When is it getting here?

141
00:14:26,752 --> 00:14:30,387
Mr. Shephard, I can't tell you
how deeply sorry we are.

142
00:14:30,388 --> 00:14:34,138
But we don't know
when it will arrive...

143
00:14:34,226 --> 00:14:37,479
Because we're not exactly sure
where it is.

144
00:14:47,307 --> 00:14:49,657
Stop right here!

145
00:15:01,814 --> 00:15:04,254
Who are you?

146
00:15:04,616 --> 00:15:07,089
I know who they are.

147
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:12,160
They were on the first plane...

148
00:15:12,194 --> 00:15:14,960
Oceanic 815, along with me.

149
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:28,470
You sure?

150
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,927
Shoot 'em.

151
00:15:34,027 --> 00:15:37,799
- Whoa! No, hey! No! No! No! No!
- Jacob sent us! Jacob sent us!

152
00:15:41,096 --> 00:15:42,874
Uh, what did... what did you just say?

153
00:15:42,974 --> 00:15:45,324
I said Jacob sent us.

154
00:15:45,910 --> 00:15:48,710
He said you would help our friend.

155
00:15:52,438 --> 00:15:54,788
He wants you to prove it.

156
00:16:01,513 --> 00:16:04,601
He gave me that guitar case!

157
00:16:09,270 --> 00:16:11,620
Did you look inside it?

158
00:16:11,942 --> 00:16:14,292
Maybe.

159
00:16:44,212 --> 00:16:46,562
Dude!

160
00:17:00,879 --> 00:17:03,229
What are your names?

161
00:17:03,652 --> 00:17:05,596
Hugo.

162
00:17:05,696 --> 00:17:08,046
Hugo Reyes.

163
00:17:08,956 --> 00:17:11,306
Tell him.

164
00:17:11,808 --> 00:17:14,158
Jin-Soo Kwon.

165
00:17:15,202 --> 00:17:17,380
Kate Austen.

166
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:19,830
Jack Shephard.

167
00:17:21,162 --> 00:17:23,512
What about him?

168
00:17:23,716 --> 00:17:26,066
Sayid Jarrah.

169
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:40,978
Pick him up. Get him to the spring.

170
00:17:41,967 --> 00:17:44,317
Hey! Excuse me.

171
00:17:44,859 --> 00:17:48,851
I carried that case across the ocean
and, like, through time,

172
00:17:49,889 --> 00:17:52,239
So I wanna know
what that paper says.

173
00:17:57,102 --> 00:17:59,799
That paper said that if
your friend there dies...

174
00:18:00,745 --> 00:18:03,095
we're all in a lot of trouble.

175
00:18:22,732 --> 00:18:25,082
And what business are you in, sir?

176
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:27,620
No English.

177
00:18:33,340 --> 00:18:35,799
This letter says
the watch is a business gift.

178
00:18:35,841 --> 00:18:38,546
But can you tell me
what business you're in?

179
00:18:55,104 --> 00:18:57,454
Step back, sir.

180
00:19:06,571 --> 00:19:08,921
What are you doing with this?

181
00:19:10,831 --> 00:19:14,162
Anything over $10,000 has to be declared.

182
00:19:15,090 --> 00:19:18,568
You... didn't... declare this.

183
00:19:22,571 --> 00:19:24,983
Sir, you're gonna have to come with me.

184
00:19:25,103 --> 00:19:26,699
Let's go have a talk...

185
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:29,149
This way.

186
00:19:30,193 --> 00:19:33,107
Anne, take her to the waiting area.

187
00:19:33,108 --> 00:19:34,489
Ms. Paik?

188
00:19:34,589 --> 00:19:36,939
Do you understand any English?

189
00:19:36,989 --> 00:19:38,345
Because if you do,

190
00:19:38,445 --> 00:19:40,795
if this is just a misunderstanding,

191
00:19:41,209 --> 00:19:43,559
you should speak up now.

192
00:19:44,921 --> 00:19:47,385
Do you understand me?

193
00:19:50,596 --> 00:19:53,252
No... English.

194
00:20:22,292 --> 00:20:24,322
The water isn't clear.

195
00:20:24,422 --> 00:20:26,772
What happened?

196
00:21:05,370 --> 00:21:06,646
What is he doing?

197
00:21:06,746 --> 00:21:09,096
I don't know.

198
00:21:17,958 --> 00:21:20,308
Who did this to him?

199
00:21:21,248 --> 00:21:25,424
It's my fault. I-I didn't
shoot him, but it's my fault.

200
00:21:30,812 --> 00:21:33,162
If we do this, there are risks.

201
00:21:38,476 --> 00:21:40,826
You understand?

202
00:21:41,340 --> 00:21:43,690
Do what you have to do.

203
00:21:49,149 --> 00:21:51,597
Take off the coveralls, put him in.

204
00:22:29,837 --> 00:22:32,187
What are they doing?

205
00:22:34,403 --> 00:22:37,955
- Can unconscious people hold their breath?
- No.

206
00:22:48,096 --> 00:22:50,446
He's awake. Let him up.

207
00:22:54,786 --> 00:22:57,136
What are they waiting for?

208
00:22:58,701 --> 00:23:01,051
That's enough!

209
00:23:03,166 --> 00:23:05,516
I said let him up!

210
00:23:10,618 --> 00:23:13,386
You're not saving him!
You're drowning him!

211
00:24:24,777 --> 00:24:27,127
Your friend is dead.

212
00:25:05,534 --> 00:25:07,884
Jack...

213
00:25:08,494 --> 00:25:10,844
Jack, stop what you're doing.

214
00:25:20,482 --> 00:25:22,832
Jack, he's dead.

215
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:26,799
He's not coming back. Stop it!

216
00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:52,658
Passengers arriving on
flight 2230 from Argentina,

217
00:25:53,007 --> 00:25:55,911
claim your baggage on carousel 3.

218
00:26:07,245 --> 00:26:08,545
Attention all passengers

219
00:26:08,645 --> 00:26:12,053
arriving on flight 3226 from Sao Paulo, Brazil,

220
00:26:12,074 --> 00:26:15,519
please proceed to baggage claim 5.

221
00:26:57,114 --> 00:26:59,978
Welcome to Los Angeles international airport.

222
00:27:00,259 --> 00:27:03,400
This is a nonsmoking facility. Thank you.

223
00:27:05,595 --> 00:27:07,945
Whoa, whoa, whoa. I don't
think so, lady. The line.

224
00:27:10,378 --> 00:27:12,728
There's a line!

225
00:27:13,229 --> 00:27:14,678
Sorry.

226
00:27:14,778 --> 00:27:16,117
Where are we on the outback grosses?

227
00:27:16,217 --> 00:27:19,586
Did Laura get a response
on the title registration thing?

228
00:27:20,042 --> 00:27:22,392
Well, it should've cleared.

229
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:24,092
Outback's just a name.

230
00:27:24,192 --> 00:27:26,825
What are they saying,
they own the entire outback?

231
00:27:27,655 --> 00:27:29,598
That's just stupid.

232
00:27:29,698 --> 00:27:30,550
Have 'em cover it, okay?

233
00:27:30,650 --> 00:27:34,050
She's gonna be coming out of customs,
So I want you guys to take the other door.

234
00:27:34,059 --> 00:27:38,599
Oh, I didn't get the, uh,
Tustin inventory report yet.

235
00:27:40,119 --> 00:27:42,469
Get on it.

236
00:27:48,781 --> 00:27:50,401
Hey!

237
00:27:50,501 --> 00:27:52,851
Hey! Watch it!

238
00:27:53,562 --> 00:27:54,999
Go! Go now!

239
00:27:55,099 --> 00:27:57,063
Lady, I already have a customer.

240
00:27:57,163 --> 00:27:59,207
I said go.

241
00:27:59,307 --> 00:28:01,463
Hey, what are you doing?

242
00:28:01,563 --> 00:28:03,913
Go now!

243
00:28:06,121 --> 00:28:09,993
Hey! Hey! Stop the cab!

244
00:28:30,176 --> 00:28:32,767
Thought you might like a little
something to eat or drink.

245
00:28:32,768 --> 00:28:37,011
Zack, Emma, then take the rest
to the people over there.

246
00:28:40,787 --> 00:28:43,137
Just drop 'em in here.

247
00:28:48,818 --> 00:28:51,519
Hey. What happened?

248
00:28:52,447 --> 00:28:54,797
They jumped us in the jungle.

249
00:28:55,208 --> 00:28:56,837
He took four of them out

250
00:28:56,937 --> 00:28:59,587
before one of them hit him with a damn rock.

251
00:29:04,274 --> 00:29:06,704
You. Come with me.

252
00:29:08,631 --> 00:29:10,981
Come with you where?

253
00:29:22,826 --> 00:29:25,176
He wants to know what Jacob told you.

254
00:29:26,237 --> 00:29:28,587
He told me to come here.

255
00:29:28,758 --> 00:29:31,108
Said you guys would save Sayid.

256
00:29:34,751 --> 00:29:37,101
He was beyond saving.

257
00:29:37,191 --> 00:29:38,691
Wait a sec.

258
00:29:38,791 --> 00:29:41,141
You're not translating
anything I say to him,

259
00:29:41,481 --> 00:29:43,831
Which means you totally
understand me, dude.

260
00:29:44,049 --> 00:29:47,799
I don't like the way
English tastes on my tongue.

261
00:29:50,354 --> 00:29:52,366
When's Jacob getting here?

262
00:29:52,466 --> 00:29:54,949
- What do you mean?
- Is he coming to the temple?

263
00:29:55,573 --> 00:29:57,923
I really don't think
that's gonna happen, man.

264
00:29:59,464 --> 00:30:00,612
Why not?

265
00:30:00,712 --> 00:30:03,062
You know... 'cause he's dead.

266
00:30:07,371 --> 00:30:08,951
What?

267
00:30:09,051 --> 00:30:11,401
You guys didn't know?

268
00:30:18,830 --> 00:30:21,351
Everyone to your posts!

269
00:30:21,367 --> 00:30:24,868
On the walls!
Prepare the ash!

270
00:30:35,025 --> 00:30:38,289
Ten men to the north side!

271
00:30:40,049 --> 00:30:43,019
Send the warning!

272
00:30:44,329 --> 00:30:46,679
Light it!

273
00:31:00,740 --> 00:31:02,380
Guess we're not getting out of here, huh?

274
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:06,036
This isn't to keep you in.
It's to keep him out.

275
00:31:06,156 --> 00:31:08,674
"Him" who?

276
00:31:21,951 --> 00:31:24,301
What are you?

277
00:31:25,114 --> 00:31:27,682
I'm not a "what", Ben.
I'm a "who".

278
00:31:27,802 --> 00:31:30,152
You're the monster.

279
00:31:30,352 --> 00:31:33,147
Let's not resort to name-calling.

280
00:31:40,274 --> 00:31:42,624
You used me.

281
00:31:43,926 --> 00:31:46,276
You couldn't kill him yourself,

282
00:31:46,553 --> 00:31:48,903
so you made me do it.

283
00:31:49,031 --> 00:31:51,463
I didn't make you do anything.

284
00:31:55,621 --> 00:31:57,971
You should know...

285
00:31:58,611 --> 00:32:01,311
he was very confused when you killed him.

286
00:32:01,366 --> 00:32:04,077
I seriously doubt
that Jacob was ever confused.

287
00:32:04,088 --> 00:32:06,438
I'm not talking about Jacob.

288
00:32:08,659 --> 00:32:11,009
I'm talking about John Locke.

289
00:32:13,287 --> 00:32:16,500
Do you wanna know what
he was thinking while you...

290
00:32:16,956 --> 00:32:19,600
choked the life out of him,
Benjamin?

291
00:32:19,692 --> 00:32:22,981
What the last thought
that ran through his head was?

292
00:32:23,605 --> 00:32:25,955
"I don't understand."

293
00:32:29,721 --> 00:32:32,441
Isn't that just the saddest
thing you ever heard?

294
00:32:35,217 --> 00:32:37,567
But it's fitting in a way.

295
00:32:37,698 --> 00:32:40,348
Because when John first came
to the island,

296
00:32:40,782 --> 00:32:43,132
he was a very sad man.

297
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:44,931
A victim.

298
00:32:45,031 --> 00:32:48,421
Shouting at the world for being
told what he couldn't do...

299
00:32:48,442 --> 00:32:50,792
Even though they were right.

300
00:32:51,349 --> 00:32:52,737
He was weak

301
00:32:52,837 --> 00:32:57,343
and pathetic and irreparably broken.

302
00:32:58,479 --> 00:33:01,261
But despite all that,

303
00:33:01,455 --> 00:33:04,191
there was something admirable about him.

304
00:33:04,575 --> 00:33:08,307
He was the only one of them
who didn't want to leave.

305
00:33:08,798 --> 00:33:12,403
The only one who realized how pitiful

306
00:33:12,523 --> 00:33:15,983
the life he'd left behind actually was.

307
00:33:25,354 --> 00:33:27,704
What do you want?

308
00:33:28,306 --> 00:33:31,282
Well, that's the great irony
here, Ben, because...

309
00:33:32,018 --> 00:33:35,737
I want the one thing
that John Locke didn't.

310
00:33:37,644 --> 00:33:41,740
I want to go home.

311
00:33:58,652 --> 00:34:01,002
Good-bye, dude.

312
00:34:01,144 --> 00:34:04,184
If you ever wanna talk,

313
00:34:04,847 --> 00:34:07,620
I'm around.

314
00:34:16,172 --> 00:34:18,522
What?

315
00:34:19,877 --> 00:34:22,227
Nothing.

316
00:34:36,113 --> 00:34:38,463
Hey.

317
00:34:40,133 --> 00:34:42,483
Where are we?

318
00:34:43,265 --> 00:34:45,277
We're in a temple.

319
00:34:45,377 --> 00:34:48,111
We got caught by the others again.

320
00:34:48,231 --> 00:34:50,581
Yeah. I mean...

321
00:34:50,615 --> 00:34:54,071
This time they're protecting us.

322
00:34:56,119 --> 00:34:57,779
Of course they are.

323
00:34:57,879 --> 00:35:00,229
You all right?

324
00:35:06,342 --> 00:35:08,692
I'm so sorry.

325
00:35:23,551 --> 00:35:26,301
You know what you said
back at the hatch?

326
00:35:26,630 --> 00:35:28,980
He's just trying to help us.

327
00:35:30,378 --> 00:35:32,728
I ain't gonna kill Jack.

328
00:35:35,858 --> 00:35:39,566
He deserves to suffer on this rock
just like the rest of us.

329
00:35:44,547 --> 00:35:46,515
Yeah.

330
00:35:46,615 --> 00:35:50,083
I know, and... you think
I knew this was gonna happen?

331
00:35:51,185 --> 00:35:54,909
I scheduled it so soon because
want to get it over with.

332
00:35:57,095 --> 00:35:58,030
I don't know, mom.

333
00:35:58,130 --> 00:36:00,505
He's not here, so I can't
tell you what to tell them,

334
00:36:00,516 --> 00:36:03,657
other than we can't
have the service without him.

335
00:36:04,598 --> 00:36:06,270
Yeah.

336
00:36:06,370 --> 00:36:08,967
I will call you if I hear anything.

337
00:36:11,531 --> 00:36:13,881
What did you lose?

338
00:36:14,621 --> 00:36:16,426
Excuse me.

339
00:36:16,455 --> 00:36:19,227
Oh, they lost one of my bags.
What about you?

340
00:36:21,391 --> 00:36:23,741
You wouldn't believe me
if I told you.

341
00:36:24,111 --> 00:36:26,461
Try me.

342
00:36:26,967 --> 00:36:29,317
They lost my father.

343
00:36:30,504 --> 00:36:31,812
I'm sorry?

344
00:36:31,912 --> 00:36:33,625
He died in Australia a couple days ago,

345
00:36:33,725 --> 00:36:36,756
and, um, I flew down to get him.

346
00:36:41,745 --> 00:36:43,927
My condolences.

347
00:36:44,027 --> 00:36:44,890
Yo.

348
00:36:44,907 --> 00:36:48,250
The coffin was supposed to go on
the plane in Sydney, but it didn't.

349
00:36:48,859 --> 00:36:51,635
Apparently, he's somewhere in transit,
which is their way of saying

350
00:36:51,652 --> 00:36:54,528
they have no idea where the hell he is.

351
00:36:54,864 --> 00:36:57,214
Well, how could they know?

352
00:36:58,127 --> 00:36:59,475
Well, they're the ones
that checked him in.

353
00:36:59,575 --> 00:37:01,973
I mean, they've gotta have
some kind of tracking system.

354
00:37:01,989 --> 00:37:05,749
No, I'm not talking about the coffin.
I mean, how could they know where he is?

355
00:37:08,110 --> 00:37:12,446
They didn't lose your father.
They just lost his body.

356
00:37:24,453 --> 00:37:26,934
Either way, your story
beats the hell out of mine.

357
00:37:27,054 --> 00:37:29,404
All that was in my suitcase
was a bunch of knives.

358
00:37:29,570 --> 00:37:30,665
Thanks.

359
00:37:30,765 --> 00:37:32,377
You some kind of salesman?

360
00:37:32,477 --> 00:37:34,827
Yeah, somethin' like that.

361
00:37:37,165 --> 00:37:40,725
Well, it's nice talking to you.
I-I hope you find that coffin.

362
00:37:42,502 --> 00:37:45,052
- I hope you find your knives.
- Yeah, thanks.

363
00:37:45,294 --> 00:37:47,749
Mind if I ask
what happened to you?

364
00:37:49,417 --> 00:37:52,606
I'm sorry. I'm only asking
because I'm a spinal surgeon.

365
00:37:52,635 --> 00:37:55,135
- I-I didn't mean to...
- Oh, no, don't worry about it. Uh...

366
00:37:56,495 --> 00:37:58,845
Uh, surgery isn't gonna
do anything to help me.

367
00:37:58,961 --> 00:38:01,856
Uh, my condition
is irreversible.

368
00:38:01,976 --> 00:38:04,326
Nothing's irreversible.

369
00:38:13,271 --> 00:38:15,621
If you ever want a consult...

370
00:38:16,247 --> 00:38:18,597
just, uh, give me a call.

371
00:38:20,065 --> 00:38:22,415
It's on the house.

372
00:38:22,538 --> 00:38:24,888
Well, thanks.

373
00:38:25,926 --> 00:38:27,698
Jack Shephard.

374
00:38:27,798 --> 00:38:30,148
I'm John. John Locke.

375
00:38:31,057 --> 00:38:34,305
- It's nice to meet you, John.
- Nice to meet you, too.

376
00:38:37,995 --> 00:38:40,345
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

377
00:38:48,958 --> 00:38:52,286
What the hell is that?

378
00:39:13,509 --> 00:39:15,859
Don't shoot him!
Don't shoot him!

379
00:39:18,284 --> 00:39:20,367
I'm seein' it,

380
00:39:20,467 --> 00:39:22,817
but I'm still not believin' it.

381
00:39:26,466 --> 00:39:28,816
Hello, Richard.

382
00:39:29,849 --> 00:39:32,199
It's good to see you
out of those chains.

383
00:39:37,834 --> 00:39:39,078
You?

384
00:39:39,178 --> 00:39:41,528
Me.

385
00:39:53,159 --> 00:39:55,509
I am very disappointed...

386
00:39:56,631 --> 00:39:58,981
In all of you.

387
00:40:42,122 --> 00:40:44,472
- You're Shephard?
- Yeah.

388
00:40:44,627 --> 00:40:47,104
We need to speak to you privately.

389
00:40:49,638 --> 00:40:51,988
If you've got something
to say to me, then say it.

390
00:40:52,490 --> 00:40:54,566
Otherwise, just leave me alone.

391
00:40:54,666 --> 00:40:56,758
I don't think you're
understanding me here.

392
00:40:56,858 --> 00:40:58,893
I'm asking politely.

393
00:40:58,993 --> 00:41:01,361
You either get up
and come with us on your own,

394
00:41:01,819 --> 00:41:03,671
or I'll have you dragged out.

395
00:41:03,771 --> 00:41:07,749
Because we are going to have this
conversation, and it's not going to be here.

396
00:41:08,161 --> 00:41:10,511
Is that right?

397
00:41:17,778 --> 00:41:20,128
Jack!

398
00:41:20,644 --> 00:41:23,801
Oh, my god.

399
00:41:32,918 --> 00:41:35,268
What happened?

400
