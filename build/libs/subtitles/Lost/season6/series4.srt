1
00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:02,806
Previously on "Lost"...

2
00:00:04,141 --> 00:00:05,191
Juliet.

3
00:00:06,020 --> 00:00:08,806
You did this.

4
00:00:10,312 --> 00:00:12,207
Kate? Hurley!

5
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:18,033
Pick him up. Get him to the spring.

6
00:00:18,033 --> 00:00:20,665
- The water isn't clear.
- What happened?

7
00:00:22,632 --> 00:00:24,665
You're not saving him!
You're drowning him!

8
00:00:26,665 --> 00:00:29,932
- Your friend is dead.
- Jack!

9
00:00:33,999 --> 00:00:37,166
What happened?

10
00:00:55,250 --> 00:00:56,881
He's alive.

11
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:08,557
It worked?

12
00:01:08,557 --> 00:01:11,295
Dude, you're okay!

13
00:01:11,295 --> 00:01:12,926
Hurley, let him breathe.

14
00:01:12,926 --> 00:01:15,633
Miles, can you go get some water?

15
00:01:15,633 --> 00:01:17,492
Yeah, on it.

16
00:01:17,492 --> 00:01:19,807
Sayid. Hey.

17
00:01:19,807 --> 00:01:21,764
How are you feeling?

18
00:01:21,764 --> 00:01:23,721
A little light-headed.

19
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:28,254
Jack...

20
00:01:30,243 --> 00:01:32,299
What happened to me?

21
00:01:34,450 --> 00:01:35,755
You died.

22
00:01:38,657 --> 00:01:40,941
How is that even possible?

23
00:01:40,941 --> 00:01:42,864
I mean...

24
00:01:42,864 --> 00:01:45,604
One minute he's gone, and now he's fine?

25
00:01:45,604 --> 00:01:47,234
Of course he's fine.

26
00:01:47,234 --> 00:01:48,017
What does that mean?

27
00:01:48,370 --> 00:01:49,093
He's an Iraqi torturer
who shoots kids

28
00:01:49,582 --> 00:01:51,311
he definitely deserves
another go-around.

29
00:02:00,672 --> 00:02:03,051
What are you looking at?

30
00:02:03,051 --> 00:02:06,247
How many guys with guns you
think are outside this place?

31
00:02:06,247 --> 00:02:09,183
- What?
- I was out cold when they brought me in here.

32
00:02:09,183 --> 00:02:11,890
How many guards did you
see? Five? Ten? A hundred?

33
00:02:11,890 --> 00:02:14,172
What are you thinking?

34
00:02:14,172 --> 00:02:16,846
I'm thinking about running, Kate.

35
00:02:19,032 --> 00:02:20,989
She's got hands in handcuffs,

36
00:02:20,989 --> 00:02:24,022
but she's probably
got 'em covered, okay?

37
00:02:25,489 --> 00:02:26,598
Hey!

38
00:02:26,598 --> 00:02:29,826
Hey, watch it.

39
00:02:29,826 --> 00:02:31,228
Go!

40
00:02:31,228 --> 00:02:33,512
Go now! Lady, I already have a customer.

41
00:02:33,512 --> 00:02:35,958
- Damn it, I said go!
- Okay.

42
00:02:37,523 --> 00:02:39,219
Ooh! Easy, easy. Slow down.

43
00:02:39,219 --> 00:02:41,273
- Hey, just slow down. Slow down!
- Okay! Okay! You said go!

44
00:02:41,273 --> 00:02:43,132
Just get us out of here.

45
00:02:43,132 --> 00:02:45,644
Hey! Hey! Stop the cab!

46
00:02:45,644 --> 00:02:47,144
Please, please just let
me out of the car...

47
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:49,557
Be quiet!

48
00:02:57,156 --> 00:02:58,421
What are you doing? Move!

49
00:02:58,422 --> 00:03:00,547
There's a guy. I'm not
gonna run him over.

50
00:03:00,547 --> 00:03:03,841
Hey. I'm walkin' here! I'm walkin' here!

51
00:03:13,886 --> 00:03:17,473
Do not get out of this car.

52
00:03:17,473 --> 00:03:19,266
Just go.

53
00:03:19,266 --> 00:03:21,778
- Go now! I don't care about the guy! Go!
- Okay.

54
00:03:23,409 --> 00:03:25,431
Hey! Hey! What the hell?!

55
00:03:25,431 --> 00:03:27,388
Hey, I got your license plate!

56
00:03:31,007 --> 00:03:33,551
At the light, take a left.

57
00:03:35,051 --> 00:03:37,236
Can you... can you please,
please just let me go?

58
00:03:37,432 --> 00:03:39,193
I promise I won't say
anything to anyone.

59
00:03:39,878 --> 00:03:41,639
Hey! Hey!

60
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:44,998
Damn it!

61
00:03:44,998 --> 00:03:47,443
Please. Please.

62
00:03:52,564 --> 00:03:54,195
Give me your purse.

63
00:03:54,195 --> 00:03:56,347
- What?
- I said, give me your purse!

64
00:03:56,347 --> 00:03:59,314
Now get out of the car.

65
00:03:59,314 --> 00:04:01,203
Can I please just...
just get my suitcase?

66
00:04:01,204 --> 00:04:02,771
No, you can't! Get out of the car!

67
00:04:14,088 --> 00:04:15,392
Easy.

68
00:04:17,121 --> 00:04:19,045
Right over there.

69
00:04:23,741 --> 00:04:25,209
All right.

70
00:04:25,209 --> 00:04:28,633
Who are these people?

71
00:04:28,633 --> 00:04:30,264
What do they want?

72
00:04:30,264 --> 00:04:32,156
It's the others, dude.

73
00:04:32,156 --> 00:04:33,786
They caught us...

74
00:04:33,786 --> 00:04:35,221
Again.

75
00:04:35,221 --> 00:04:38,645
I don't know. I think
they're trying to protect us.

76
00:04:38,645 --> 00:04:40,602
Yeah, and as... as you can see, uh,

77
00:04:40,602 --> 00:04:43,439
Hugo here has assumed
the leadership position,

78
00:04:43,439 --> 00:04:45,070
so... that's pretty great.

79
00:04:45,070 --> 00:04:46,864
What?

80
00:04:46,864 --> 00:04:49,407
The wound.

81
00:04:49,407 --> 00:04:51,560
It's almost completely closed.

82
00:05:01,278 --> 00:05:02,908
Thank you, Jack.

83
00:05:02,908 --> 00:05:06,431
- For what?
- Saving my life.

84
00:05:21,139 --> 00:05:24,205
Mr. Jarrah, will you
come with us, please?

85
00:05:24,205 --> 00:05:27,466
-  Come with you where?
- Inside. Nothing to worry about. We...

86
00:05:27,466 --> 00:05:29,716
I'm coming with him.

87
00:05:29,716 --> 00:05:32,782
Oh, I'm sorry. We need
to talk to him alone.

88
00:05:32,782 --> 00:05:35,717
- Just a few questions.
- You have a few questions? Well, so do we.

89
00:05:35,717 --> 00:05:37,543
I mean, let's start with, who are you?

90
00:05:37,543 --> 00:05:39,500
Why are you holding us here?

91
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:41,522
You...

92
00:05:47,783 --> 00:05:50,230
Once we've spoken to
Mr. Jarrah, we'll be more than happy

93
00:05:50,523 --> 00:05:52,153
to tell you everything
you want to know.

94
00:05:52,643 --> 00:05:54,208
Something tells me,

95
00:05:54,501 --> 00:05:58,057
that you're not going to
be happy to tell us anything.

96
00:06:13,253 --> 00:06:15,439
Don't shoot! Lower your weapons!

97
00:06:15,439 --> 00:06:18,667
Please, you don't have to do this.

98
00:06:18,667 --> 00:06:21,636
- We won't hurt your friend.
- He ain't my friend.

99
00:06:21,636 --> 00:06:24,407
You do what you want
with him and anybody else.

100
00:06:24,407 --> 00:06:27,211
But me? I'm walking outta here.

101
00:06:27,211 --> 00:06:28,483
James?

102
00:06:28,777 --> 00:06:30,929
I'm gone. You understand?

103
00:06:31,811 --> 00:06:33,766
Please.

104
00:06:34,745 --> 00:06:36,507
You have to stay.

105
00:06:36,507 --> 00:06:38,398
No, I don't.

106
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:58,100
Don't come after me.

107
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:17,793
Where are they taking Sayid?

108
00:07:17,793 --> 00:07:21,181
Hey, calm down!
Everybody calm down!

109
00:07:21,181 --> 00:07:23,286
- Where'd Ford go?
- What?

110
00:07:23,286 --> 00:07:24,763
Ford. Your friend who just

111
00:07:24,764 --> 00:07:27,265
- ran out of here... where did he go?
- I don't know.

112
00:07:27,265 --> 00:07:29,013
You really expect me to believe that?

113
00:07:29,014 --> 00:07:31,376
He told me he wanted
to kill me. You believe that?

114
00:07:31,376 --> 00:07:34,138
- I can bring him back.
- You know where he went?

115
00:07:34,138 --> 00:07:36,933
No, but I can track him.

116
00:07:36,933 --> 00:07:38,348
Let me go.

117
00:07:38,348 --> 00:07:40,978
I will bring him back,
and I can make him stay.

118
00:07:40,978 --> 00:07:42,853
Kate...

119
00:07:42,853 --> 00:07:44,695
You sure you wanna go out
there alone with these people?

120
00:07:44,695 --> 00:07:47,753
I'll go with her.

121
00:07:49,628 --> 00:07:52,950
It's very important that
he gets back here safely.

122
00:07:52,950 --> 00:07:55,415
What makes you think
he's gonna listen to you?

123
00:07:55,415 --> 00:07:58,375
I can be very convincing
when I wanna be.

124
00:08:12,419 --> 00:08:14,720
Where's your tire hammer?

125
00:08:18,799 --> 00:08:20,443
You got a problem.

126
00:08:20,443 --> 00:08:22,514
So do you. Where's your tire hammer?

127
00:08:22,514 --> 00:08:24,127
Tire hammer'll just
cut off your wrists.

128
00:08:25,113 --> 00:08:26,593
Your problem is you
need a punch press,

129
00:08:27,185 --> 00:08:28,270
and you're not gonna be able

130
00:08:28,468 --> 00:08:31,625
to use one of those and
keep that gun pointed at me.

131
00:08:31,822 --> 00:08:33,860
- You volunteering?
- I got steady hands,

132
00:08:34,058 --> 00:08:37,807
but I kinda feel like we
got off on the wrong foot.

133
00:08:39,452 --> 00:08:41,096
I'll give you $200.

134
00:08:45,273 --> 00:08:46,719
Now hold still.

135
00:08:56,684 --> 00:08:58,263
Thanks.

136
00:08:58,460 --> 00:09:00,236
So why the bracelets?

137
00:09:01,026 --> 00:09:03,887
I'm wanted for murder.

138
00:09:03,887 --> 00:09:05,629
Murder?

139
00:09:05,629 --> 00:09:08,490
You don't happen to have
somewhere I could change, do you?

140
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:11,187
Bathroom's over there.

141
00:09:11,285 --> 00:09:11,977
Make it quick.

142
00:09:12,569 --> 00:09:14,442
Thank you.

143
00:10:12,850 --> 00:10:15,021
You better not slow us down.

144
00:10:15,021 --> 00:10:18,013
You better not slow me down.

145
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:24,986
I'd go with you, but...

146
00:10:24,986 --> 00:10:28,012
But... Sawyer would kill you?

147
00:10:32,911 --> 00:10:36,166
I'll take care of James.
You take care of Sayid.

148
00:10:37,844 --> 00:10:40,080
Deal.

149
00:10:45,145 --> 00:10:48,795
Good-bye.

150
00:10:50,866 --> 00:10:52,775
Be careful.

151
00:11:13,757 --> 00:11:16,617
What is it you want?

152
00:11:19,414 --> 00:11:21,978
Please, whatever you're thinking of doing...

153
00:11:29,115 --> 00:11:32,469
What is that?

154
00:11:48,254 --> 00:11:50,623
Just tell me what you want.

155
00:12:18,971 --> 00:12:20,780
Why?

156
00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:23,214
Why are you doing this?

157
00:12:36,861 --> 00:12:40,315
I don't have any secrets.

158
00:12:40,315 --> 00:12:42,682
Ask...

159
00:13:01,659 --> 00:13:03,959
I'm sorry we had to
put you through that.

160
00:13:04,157 --> 00:13:07,677
- It was a test. We had to be sure.
- Test to be sure of what?

161
00:13:07,677 --> 00:13:10,176
Don't worry.

162
00:13:10,176 --> 00:13:11,821
You passed.

163
00:13:25,402 --> 00:13:29,250
I just lied to him, didn't I?

164
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:44,222
Yes.

165
00:13:45,910 --> 00:13:47,550
Where were you going?

166
00:13:47,550 --> 00:13:48,795
What?

167
00:13:48,795 --> 00:13:51,581
Before I got in the cab,
where were you going?

168
00:13:51,581 --> 00:13:53,644
Why, so you can hijack them, too?

169
00:13:55,513 --> 00:13:57,480
I was waiting for a bus.

170
00:13:57,480 --> 00:14:01,248
I came to bring you your stuff.

171
00:14:01,248 --> 00:14:04,131
Relax. I didn't take your money.

172
00:14:04,131 --> 00:14:06,753
Well, uh, gee, thanks.

173
00:14:06,753 --> 00:14:10,030
- So where were you goin'?
- Don't worry about it.

174
00:14:12,324 --> 00:14:13,897
Fine.

175
00:14:17,633 --> 00:14:19,599
Langdon street.

176
00:14:19,599 --> 00:14:21,565
Brentwood.

177
00:14:22,909 --> 00:14:24,876
You got family there?

178
00:14:25,466 --> 00:14:26,515
Uh, no.

179
00:14:27,498 --> 00:14:30,053
It's the... couple who's
adopting my baby.

180
00:14:30,906 --> 00:14:33,561
They were, um, they were
meant to meet me at the airport,

181
00:14:34,052 --> 00:14:36,773
but I guess they got their
days mixed up or somethin'.

182
00:14:37,067 --> 00:14:39,689
- It's not like they abandoned me.
- Brentwood's not far. Get in.

183
00:14:39,689 --> 00:14:41,818
Seriously?

184
00:14:41,818 --> 00:14:44,898
Do you want a ride or not?

185
00:14:55,222 --> 00:14:58,139
So why do you people want
us to stay at the temple?

186
00:14:57,156 --> 00:14:58,794
We're protecting you.

187
00:14:59,089 --> 00:15:01,743
- From what?
- You've been on this island for a while, right?

188
00:15:02,136 --> 00:15:03,874
Ever see a big pillar of black smoke...

189
00:15:04,169 --> 00:15:06,691
- makes a "ticka ticka" Sound, looks pissed off?
- Yes.

190
00:15:07,085 --> 00:15:08,625
From that.

191
00:15:09,412 --> 00:15:12,492
Do you know anything about
another plane coming in?

192
00:15:12,492 --> 00:15:15,475
- An Ajira flight.
- I'm sorry. Is this a press conference?

193
00:15:15,671 --> 00:15:16,720
I think he means the one that landed...

194
00:15:17,703 --> 00:15:20,980
Justin. Shut up.

195
00:15:25,469 --> 00:15:27,436
No, no, no, that's a decoy trail.

196
00:15:27,436 --> 00:15:28,944
He went this way.

197
00:15:28,944 --> 00:15:32,056
- And you're basing this on what?
- Experience.

198
00:15:32,056 --> 00:15:33,729
Aldo.

199
00:15:33,729 --> 00:15:35,038
What?

200
00:15:35,038 --> 00:15:37,004
I think she's right.

201
00:15:37,004 --> 00:15:38,775
Of course she is.

202
00:15:38,775 --> 00:15:41,135
After you, princess.

203
00:15:41,135 --> 00:15:43,986
So what's your strategy for
bringing your boyfriend back?

204
00:15:43,986 --> 00:15:46,935
I hope you got one, because
he shot a guy on his way out.

205
00:15:46,935 --> 00:15:47,947
If he tries that on me,

206
00:15:47,948 --> 00:15:49,884
- I'm gonna blow his head off.
- Whoa. Watch it.

207
00:15:51,751 --> 00:15:53,260
Thank you.

208
00:15:53,260 --> 00:15:56,471
Looks like one of Rousseau's traps.

209
00:15:56,471 --> 00:15:58,438
- The Frenchwoman?
- No, she's been dead for years.

210
00:15:58,438 --> 00:16:00,896
- This... this couldn't be one of her...
- Justin!

211
00:16:00,896 --> 00:16:02,501
Shut up.

212
00:16:05,483 --> 00:16:07,253
What was he gonna say?

213
00:16:08,432 --> 00:16:10,595
You don't even remember me, do you?

214
00:16:12,071 --> 00:16:14,233
You don't recognize me?

215
00:16:14,233 --> 00:16:16,855
Well, maybe this will jog your memory.

216
00:16:16,855 --> 00:16:18,494
Three years ago,

217
00:16:18,494 --> 00:16:20,460
You staged yourself a little
prison break, and you did it

218
00:16:20,460 --> 00:16:22,918
by knocking the guard out
with the butt of you rifle.

219
00:16:22,918 --> 00:16:24,786
That would be me.

220
00:16:28,948 --> 00:16:30,586
Aah!

221
00:16:33,568 --> 00:16:35,797
What are you doing?

222
00:16:38,353 --> 00:16:41,171
Escaping.

223
00:16:46,676 --> 00:16:48,315
Sayid!

224
00:16:50,281 --> 00:16:52,117
You okay, man?

225
00:16:52,117 --> 00:16:54,017
Jack! He's back!

226
00:16:59,294 --> 00:17:01,620
Sayid, what happened?

227
00:17:02,603 --> 00:17:04,340
- They tortured me.
- Why?

228
00:17:04,635 --> 00:17:08,666
Don't know. They
didn't ask me any questions.

229
00:17:16,826 --> 00:17:18,792
Step aside.

230
00:17:35,407 --> 00:17:36,915
Hey, Shephard.

231
00:17:36,915 --> 00:17:39,373
We were hoping you'd
come on your own.

232
00:17:39,865 --> 00:17:42,945
What the hell did you do to Sayid?

233
00:17:42,945 --> 00:17:45,959
We... we didn't do anything
to him. Y-your friend is sick.

234
00:17:45,959 --> 00:17:47,599
Sick with what?

235
00:17:49,663 --> 00:17:51,434
He's...

236
00:17:51,434 --> 00:17:54,251
Yeah, I... not really...

237
00:17:54,251 --> 00:17:56,217
There's not really a literal translation,

238
00:17:56,217 --> 00:17:58,347
the closest thing would be...

239
00:17:58,544 --> 00:18:00,542
- Infected.
- Infected?

240
00:18:00,542 --> 00:18:02,116
He's not even running a fever.

241
00:18:03,591 --> 00:18:05,820
What...

242
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:07,786
Did I say something funny?

243
00:18:07,786 --> 00:18:10,735
I doubt it. He doesn't
really have a sense of humor.

244
00:18:21,713 --> 00:18:25,744
He says you have to
give your friend this pill.

245
00:18:28,333 --> 00:18:29,972
Are you serious?

246
00:18:31,643 --> 00:18:33,610
Why don't you give it to him?

247
00:18:33,708 --> 00:18:36,525
Because it won't work
unless he takes it willingly,

248
00:18:36,623 --> 00:18:38,098
and he won't take
it willingly from us.

249
00:18:38,295 --> 00:18:39,901
Well, then maybe you
should've asked him to take it

250
00:18:40,491 --> 00:18:43,211
- before you tortured him.
- We didn't torture him.

251
00:18:44,195 --> 00:18:47,766
- We were diagnosing him.
- To see if he was infected.

252
00:18:47,766 --> 00:18:49,044
Yes.

253
00:18:49,044 --> 00:18:51,175
I'm not gonna give anything to Sayid

254
00:18:51,175 --> 00:18:53,141
unless I know what's in it.

255
00:18:55,828 --> 00:18:58,253
Tell me, Shephard...

256
00:18:58,253 --> 00:19:00,154
your friend...

257
00:19:01,891 --> 00:19:05,627
how did he get shot?

258
00:19:05,627 --> 00:19:07,265
He was, um...

259
00:19:09,395 --> 00:19:11,362
he was helping me.

260
00:19:11,362 --> 00:19:13,721
So it was your fault?

261
00:19:13,721 --> 00:19:15,852
Yes.

262
00:19:15,852 --> 00:19:17,818
And there have been others

263
00:19:17,818 --> 00:19:21,915
who were hurt or died...
helping you?

264
00:19:23,290 --> 00:19:25,256
Yes.

265
00:19:27,387 --> 00:19:29,975
Well...

266
00:19:29,975 --> 00:19:33,908
Then this is your chance
to redeem yourself.

267
00:19:40,921 --> 00:19:42,822
It's medicine,

268
00:19:42,822 --> 00:19:45,935
and your friend needs it.

269
00:19:45,935 --> 00:19:48,885
What happens if I don't give it to him?

270
00:19:53,538 --> 00:19:56,390
The infection will spread.

271
00:20:03,316 --> 00:20:06,069
So... nothing? There wasn't anything?

272
00:20:06,069 --> 00:20:08,035
No white light? Angels singing?

273
00:20:08,035 --> 00:20:09,509
No dead relatives?

274
00:20:09,509 --> 00:20:11,935
I remember being shot.

275
00:20:11,935 --> 00:20:14,131
You're not a zombie, right?

276
00:20:16,784 --> 00:20:20,586
No. I am not a zombie.

277
00:20:20,586 --> 00:20:22,454
Hey.

278
00:20:26,780 --> 00:20:29,042
You mind giving me
and Sayid a minute?

279
00:20:29,042 --> 00:20:31,236
Yeah, see, private talks
kinda freak me out

280
00:20:31,236 --> 00:20:32,712
'cause they usually lead

281
00:20:32,712 --> 00:20:35,464
to me having to do something
I don't quite understand.

282
00:20:35,464 --> 00:20:37,430
I'm right there with you.

283
00:20:37,430 --> 00:20:41,264
It's fine. We'll be in the
food court if you need us.

284
00:20:51,457 --> 00:20:55,913
So did they tell you why they
burnt me with a hot poker?

285
00:20:55,913 --> 00:20:59,649
They said they were
trying to diagnose you.

286
00:20:59,649 --> 00:21:01,584
Right.

287
00:21:01,584 --> 00:21:04,729
They told me it was some sort of test,

288
00:21:04,729 --> 00:21:08,105
which they said I passed.

289
00:21:08,105 --> 00:21:09,743
Clearly, I didn't.

290
00:21:15,609 --> 00:21:18,361
What's that?

291
00:21:18,361 --> 00:21:21,803
They want you to take it.

292
00:21:21,803 --> 00:21:23,769
It's medicine, according to them.

293
00:21:23,769 --> 00:21:26,390
What about according to you?

294
00:21:26,390 --> 00:21:28,717
I don't know.

295
00:21:31,208 --> 00:21:33,633
And you know, before when you...

296
00:21:33,633 --> 00:21:36,518
when you thanked me
for saving your life, I...

297
00:21:38,418 --> 00:21:41,924
I didn't have anything
to do with it, Sayid.

298
00:21:41,924 --> 00:21:43,923
I didn't fix you, they did.

299
00:21:48,414 --> 00:21:51,395
I don't care who fixed me.

300
00:21:51,395 --> 00:21:54,673
I only care about who I trust,

301
00:21:54,673 --> 00:21:57,720
so if you want me
to take that pill, Jack,

302
00:21:57,720 --> 00:22:21,563
I'll do it.

303
00:22:09,670 --> 00:22:11,921
Wait. Where are you going?

304
00:22:11,921 --> 00:22:13,551
Catching up with Sawyer.

305
00:22:13,551 --> 00:22:16,485
So you never planned to
bring him back to the temple.

306
00:22:16,485 --> 00:22:18,605
No. I'm not interested in
being a prisoner. Are you?

307
00:22:18,605 --> 00:22:21,344
- Where did your plane land, Kate?
- What?

308
00:22:21,344 --> 00:22:23,952
The Ajira plane that you, Jack
and Hurley came in on...

309
00:22:23,952 --> 00:22:26,463
- Where did it land?
- I don't know.

310
00:22:26,463 --> 00:22:30,442
Sun was on that plane, too,
and I have to find her.

311
00:22:30,442 --> 00:22:32,431
You think they're gonna tell you?

312
00:22:32,431 --> 00:22:35,723
You think they care about you
or about Sun or about any of us?

313
00:22:37,778 --> 00:22:40,451
Who do you care about, Kate?

314
00:22:40,451 --> 00:22:43,354
Good luck, Jin.

315
00:22:43,354 --> 00:22:45,800
Once you catch up with
Sawyer, then what?

316
00:22:47,528 --> 00:22:49,974
I guess we'll figure that out together.

317
00:22:56,168 --> 00:22:57,929
So, uh...

318
00:22:57,929 --> 00:22:59,886
What happened to your handcuffs?

319
00:22:59,886 --> 00:23:02,234
I cut them off.

320
00:23:06,929 --> 00:23:10,223
It's a beautiful neighborhood.

321
00:23:10,223 --> 00:23:12,506
I bet they're a really nice couple.

322
00:23:17,821 --> 00:23:19,777
What?

323
00:23:19,777 --> 00:23:21,734
I didn't say anything.

324
00:23:21,734 --> 00:23:26,038
What, you... you think they didn't
come to the airport on purpose?

325
00:23:26,038 --> 00:23:28,745
Why would I think that?

326
00:23:28,745 --> 00:23:31,679
Good, 'cause they didn't.

327
00:23:33,831 --> 00:23:36,439
This is it.

328
00:23:48,146 --> 00:23:50,102
Um...

329
00:23:50,102 --> 00:23:52,483
Will you come in with me?

330
00:23:52,483 --> 00:23:54,341
Are you kidding me?

331
00:23:54,341 --> 00:23:55,809
Please, I-I just...

332
00:23:55,809 --> 00:23:59,527
I really don't want to go
up there on my own.

333
00:24:09,667 --> 00:24:11,624
Uh, hi. Uh, Mrs. Baskum?

334
00:24:11,624 --> 00:24:13,319
I-I'm... I'm Claire Littleton.

335
00:24:15,406 --> 00:24:16,972
Oh, my god.

336
00:24:16,972 --> 00:24:19,906
I'm so sorry.

337
00:24:19,906 --> 00:24:22,678
Um...

338
00:24:22,678 --> 00:24:25,612
My husband...

339
00:24:29,525 --> 00:24:31,482
He left me,

340
00:24:31,482 --> 00:24:34,743
and... believe me,

341
00:24:34,743 --> 00:24:37,253
I wanted the baby so much,

342
00:24:37,253 --> 00:24:39,210
but...

343
00:24:39,210 --> 00:24:41,752
I can't do it alone.

344
00:24:41,752 --> 00:24:43,091
I'm sorry.

345
00:24:43,091 --> 00:24:46,482
Look, I know I should've called you...

346
00:24:46,482 --> 00:24:48,177
So, uh, wh...

347
00:24:48,177 --> 00:24:50,556
Y-y-you just changed your mind?

348
00:24:50,556 --> 00:24:52,995
Look, my... my life is just...

349
00:24:54,676 --> 00:24:55,893
a little bit complicated right now.

350
00:24:55,893 --> 00:24:58,240
She came all the way from
Australia, and you don't call?

351
00:24:58,240 --> 00:24:59,711
Oh, my god.

352
00:25:02,855 --> 00:25:04,037
Are you okay?

353
00:25:04,037 --> 00:25:06,304
Aah! It's coming!

354
00:26:48,793 --> 00:26:50,261
Who's there?

355
00:26:51,793 --> 00:26:53,456
Better come out now

356
00:26:53,456 --> 00:26:56,065
or so help me, I'm
just gonna start shootin'.

357
00:27:00,239 --> 00:27:02,359
What the hell are you doin' here?

358
00:27:04,380 --> 00:27:35,929
I was worried about you.

359
00:27:37,100 --> 00:27:39,056
What's happening?

360
00:27:39,056 --> 00:27:41,991
- I-I think I'm having contractions.
- When did they start?

361
00:27:41,991 --> 00:27:44,436
- Um, about 20 minutes ago.
- Try to relax.

362
00:27:44,436 --> 00:27:47,371
We're gonna take you to
the M.F.C.U. To get you looked at.

363
00:27:47,371 --> 00:27:49,327
Are you with her?

364
00:27:49,327 --> 00:27:51,446
- Yeah.
- Okay, follow me.

365
00:27:51,446 --> 00:27:54,055
What are you doing?
What... what's going on?

366
00:27:54,055 --> 00:27:57,088
Hold on. The doctor will
be with you in just a moment.

367
00:27:57,088 --> 00:28:00,739
What... what's going on?
Is something wrong?

368
00:28:00,739 --> 00:28:02,077
Excuse me.

369
00:28:02,077 --> 00:28:04,000
- Excuse me.
- Yes.

370
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,956
- Are you a doctor?
- Yes. I'm Dr. Goodspeed.

371
00:28:05,956 --> 00:28:08,434
Can I please get your help in here?

372
00:28:12,444 --> 00:28:14,400
Ms. Littleton?

373
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:16,357
Claire, how are you feeling?

374
00:28:16,357 --> 00:28:19,193
Uncomfortable, what...
w-what's happening?

375
00:28:19,193 --> 00:28:21,443
What's happening...

376
00:28:21,443 --> 00:28:24,411
Is that mother nature's gotten
a little ahead of herself.

377
00:28:24,411 --> 00:28:26,692
Are you ready to have your baby?

378
00:28:26,692 --> 00:28:29,400
- I-I'm sorry. What?!
- You're at 36 weeks.

379
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:32,236
3 centimetres dilated
and about 80% effaced.

380
00:28:32,236 --> 00:28:35,138
Which means, if you want,
you can have your baby tonight.

381
00:28:35,138 --> 00:28:37,159
If I want? So what, you mean...
you mean you can stop it then?

382
00:28:37,649 --> 00:28:40,420
Maybe. However, to do that
would require a number of drugs.

383
00:28:40,713 --> 00:28:42,538
Drugs? I mean, w-will
that hurt the baby?

384
00:28:42,930 --> 00:28:43,583
No, they're perfectly safe.

385
00:28:44,072 --> 00:28:45,246
I just don't want to have to

386
00:28:45,539 --> 00:28:48,082
stick you with needles
if I don't have to.

387
00:28:48,277 --> 00:28:51,017
So it's up to you.

388
00:28:59,168 --> 00:29:01,157
- I'm... I'm not ready.
- Okay.

389
00:29:01,157 --> 00:29:03,798
Let's get her started
on the nifedipine drip.

390
00:29:05,298 --> 00:29:07,548
Wh... what... what is it?

391
00:29:07,548 --> 00:29:09,797
Margaret, let's do an ultrasound.

392
00:29:09,797 --> 00:29:12,080
I wanna get a picture of
what's going on in there.

393
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:14,461
Ah, it... it could just mean
the baby's out of position.

394
00:29:14,461 --> 00:29:16,417
W-w-what are you...
what are you saying?!

395
00:29:16,417 --> 00:29:18,568
W-what... what's
happening to my baby?!

396
00:29:18,568 --> 00:29:20,851
Is my baby okay?

397
00:29:20,851 --> 00:29:22,481
Is Aaron okay?

398
00:29:24,404 --> 00:29:26,296
See?

399
00:29:26,296 --> 00:29:30,143
There he is. Everything is just fine.

400
00:29:30,143 --> 00:29:32,229
Your boy just likes to move around.

401
00:29:34,024 --> 00:29:36,175
140 B.P.M.

402
00:29:36,175 --> 00:29:37,871
Perfectly normal.

403
00:29:37,871 --> 00:29:40,316
I have a feeling

404
00:29:40,316 --> 00:29:43,609
That Aaron is gonna be a handful.

405
00:29:45,566 --> 00:29:48,599
Now let's see if we can slow this down.

406
00:29:48,599 --> 00:29:50,782
You did great, mommy.

407
00:29:52,250 --> 00:29:54,141
Thanks.

408
00:30:21,301 --> 00:30:22,933
A couple of days ago,

409
00:30:22,933 --> 00:30:26,355
you asked me why I
came back to the island.

410
00:30:30,268 --> 00:30:32,224
I need to find Claire.

411
00:30:32,224 --> 00:30:35,354
I thought...

412
00:30:35,354 --> 00:30:39,071
maybe if I could catch up
to you, you could help me,

413
00:30:39,071 --> 00:30:41,028
and then...

414
00:30:41,028 --> 00:30:44,158
Maybe if we could find her
and bring her back to Aaron,

415
00:30:44,158 --> 00:30:47,092
then maybe all of this
wouldn't have been for nothing.

416
00:30:50,843 --> 00:30:53,483
I'm sorry.

417
00:30:53,483 --> 00:30:55,734
I never should've followed you.

418
00:30:55,734 --> 00:30:58,439
Which time?

419
00:31:05,613 --> 00:31:09,623
That was your house, right? With Juliet.

420
00:31:09,623 --> 00:31:11,090
Yep.

421
00:31:13,046 --> 00:31:14,547
I'm sorry.

422
00:31:14,547 --> 00:31:16,503
You already said that.

423
00:31:16,503 --> 00:31:18,655
No...

424
00:31:18,655 --> 00:31:20,448
for Juliet.

425
00:31:22,274 --> 00:31:23,740
If I hadn't come after you on the sub,

426
00:31:23,936 --> 00:31:26,382
then you two would've left,
and she would've never died.

427
00:31:27,361 --> 00:31:29,969
It's not your fault she's dead.

428
00:31:33,522 --> 00:31:35,154
It's mine.

429
00:31:36,685 --> 00:31:39,718
She was sittin' right there,

430
00:31:39,718 --> 00:31:41,674
right where you are now,

431
00:31:41,674 --> 00:31:45,196
tryin' to leave this place.

432
00:31:45,196 --> 00:31:47,804
And I convinced her to stay.

433
00:31:52,206 --> 00:31:54,815
I made her stay on this island

434
00:31:54,815 --> 00:31:58,401
'cause I didn't want to be alone.

435
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:02,867
You understand that, right?

436
00:32:09,487 --> 00:32:13,432
But, uh...

437
00:32:13,432 --> 00:32:15,617
but I think some of us

438
00:32:15,617 --> 00:32:17,573
are meant to be alone.

439
00:32:24,975 --> 00:32:28,169
I was gonna ask her to marry me.

440
00:32:41,049 --> 00:32:43,005
Ahh.

441
00:32:52,885 --> 00:32:55,851
You can probably make it back
to the temple by nightfall.

442
00:33:29,468 --> 00:33:30,935
What's that?

443
00:33:30,935 --> 00:33:33,283
It's a baseball.

444
00:33:42,413 --> 00:33:44,370
You speak pretty good English

445
00:33:44,370 --> 00:33:46,977
for someone that
needs a translator.

446
00:33:46,977 --> 00:33:49,912
We both know that I
don't need a translator.

447
00:33:49,912 --> 00:33:52,292
Then why do you have one?

448
00:33:52,292 --> 00:33:55,324
Because I have to remain separate

449
00:33:55,324 --> 00:33:58,813
from the people I'm in charge of.

450
00:33:58,813 --> 00:34:00,476
It makes it easier,

451
00:34:00,476 --> 00:34:03,476
when they don't like the
decisions I make for them.

452
00:34:06,313 --> 00:34:08,530
Who are you?

453
00:34:08,530 --> 00:34:10,715
My name is Dogen.

454
00:34:10,715 --> 00:34:12,963
Are you from here... the island?

455
00:34:12,963 --> 00:34:16,225
I was brought here like everyone else.

456
00:34:16,225 --> 00:34:18,573
What do you mean, "brought here"?

457
00:34:22,387 --> 00:34:24,343
You know exactly what I mean.

458
00:34:28,158 --> 00:34:31,909
You didn't give your
friend the pill, did you?

459
00:34:31,909 --> 00:34:34,288
No.

460
00:34:34,288 --> 00:34:36,278
Why not?

461
00:34:36,278 --> 00:34:39,635
Because I don't know what's in it.

462
00:34:39,635 --> 00:34:42,211
- It will eliminate...
- The infection, yeah.

463
00:34:42,211 --> 00:34:44,135
I got that.

464
00:34:44,135 --> 00:34:46,581
- But what's in it?
- I cannot explain.

465
00:34:46,581 --> 00:34:48,994
- Try.
- There isn't any time.

466
00:34:48,994 --> 00:34:51,439
- He'll die if you don't...
- He already died.

467
00:34:54,210 --> 00:34:56,297
What is in it?

468
00:34:59,232 --> 00:35:02,427
You just have to trust me.

469
00:35:04,742 --> 00:35:07,057
I don't trust myself.

470
00:35:07,057 --> 00:35:09,599
How am I supposed to trust you?

471
00:35:16,056 --> 00:35:18,664
Let's see where trust gets us.

472
00:35:30,990 --> 00:35:33,500
Now... are you gonna tell me

473
00:35:34,478 --> 00:35:36,108
What's in it?

474
00:35:42,532 --> 00:35:43,835
Poison.

475
00:35:52,659 --> 00:35:54,126
Come in.

476
00:35:56,344 --> 00:35:58,235
Excuse me. Ms. Littleton?

477
00:35:58,235 --> 00:35:59,637
Um, yeah?

478
00:35:59,637 --> 00:36:02,343
I'm detective Rasmussen.

479
00:36:02,343 --> 00:36:05,473
- Is Ms. Hart here?
- Uh, I'm sorry. Who?

480
00:36:05,473 --> 00:36:08,539
Joan Hart. She signed in with you.

481
00:36:08,539 --> 00:36:10,983
Oh. She was just the,
um, the cab driver.

482
00:36:10,983 --> 00:36:13,071
I needed help, and she
brought me up here.

483
00:36:13,071 --> 00:36:14,700
She left after they
treated me, though.

484
00:36:15,091 --> 00:36:16,136
Did she, uh,

485
00:36:16,430 --> 00:36:18,776
give you any indication
where she was headed?

486
00:36:19,070 --> 00:36:20,015
Why? Is something wrong?

487
00:36:20,406 --> 00:36:24,874
No. It's nothing for you to
worry about. Come on. Let's go.

488
00:36:31,688 --> 00:36:36,351
E.K.G. Tech to 3-1-5. E.K.G. Tech to 3-1-5.

489
00:36:36,351 --> 00:36:37,818
Thanks.

490
00:36:37,818 --> 00:36:39,285
Sure.

491
00:36:41,893 --> 00:36:45,480
Thank you.

492
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:49,165
Why... why are they after you?

493
00:36:49,165 --> 00:36:50,926
What... what did you do?

494
00:36:50,926 --> 00:36:54,642
Would you believe me
if I said I was innocent?

495
00:36:57,544 --> 00:36:59,436
Yeah. Yeah, I would.

496
00:37:05,696 --> 00:37:07,652
Well, I should go.

497
00:37:07,652 --> 00:37:10,815
Oh, wait. Um...

498
00:37:10,815 --> 00:37:12,152
Here. Take my credit card.

499
00:37:12,152 --> 00:37:13,358
No.

500
00:37:13,358 --> 00:37:16,586
There's not much of a
limit on it, but it's something.

501
00:37:16,586 --> 00:37:17,945
You don't have to do this.

502
00:37:17,946 --> 00:37:20,140
You didn't have to
do what you did either.

503
00:37:28,324 --> 00:37:29,987
Aaron's a great name.

504
00:37:29,987 --> 00:37:32,596
I don't know why
I said it. It's like...

505
00:37:32,596 --> 00:37:35,628
I don't know. I
knew it or something.

506
00:37:36,932 --> 00:37:39,051
I think you should keep him.

507
00:37:41,692 --> 00:37:44,040
Well, um, good luck.

508
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:46,160
Yeah.

509
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:47,463
You, too.

510
00:37:47,463 --> 00:37:50,658
Thanks.

511
00:38:39,567 --> 00:38:41,589
He swallowed it?

512
00:38:43,904 --> 00:38:45,046
Yes.

513
00:38:52,968 --> 00:38:54,239
What's this?

514
00:38:54,239 --> 00:38:56,196
Tea.

515
00:39:11,390 --> 00:39:13,836
Why would you people
want to kill Sayid?

516
00:39:18,890 --> 00:39:21,661
We believe he has been...

517
00:39:26,617 --> 00:39:29,487
Closest translation is "claimed."

518
00:39:29,487 --> 00:39:31,606
Claimed.

519
00:39:33,823 --> 00:39:35,127
By what?

520
00:39:38,290 --> 00:39:41,747
There is a darkness growing in him

521
00:39:41,747 --> 00:39:45,267
and once it reaches his heart,

522
00:39:45,267 --> 00:39:48,919
everything your friend once was...

523
00:39:48,919 --> 00:39:50,550
will be gone.

524
00:39:52,148 --> 00:39:54,722
No, I...

525
00:39:54,722 --> 00:39:57,039
how can you be sure of that?

526
00:40:01,962 --> 00:40:04,962
Because it happened to your sister.

527
00:40:29,383 --> 00:40:30,655
Get up!

528
00:40:31,763 --> 00:40:33,459
That's for my head.

529
00:40:33,459 --> 00:40:34,110
Uhh!

530
00:40:34,501 --> 00:40:35,578
Now...

531
00:40:36,165 --> 00:40:37,991
- Where's that bitch?
- I don't know.

532
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:40,729
You don't understand.
I'm going back to the temple!

533
00:40:40,827 --> 00:40:41,512
Yeah, right.

534
00:40:41,531 --> 00:40:44,577
It looks like he's alone. Maybe
we should take him back.

535
00:40:44,772 --> 00:40:47,153
Or maybe we didn't find him alive.

536
00:40:47,153 --> 00:40:49,533
Aldo, no. We can't. He's one of them.

537
00:40:49,533 --> 00:40:51,653
He may be one of them.

538
00:40:51,653 --> 00:40:53,641
