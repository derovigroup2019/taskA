1
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:31,334
We gonna sing "kumbaya"
on the way?

2
00:00:31,368 --> 00:00:33,369
It's not a guitar, man.

3
00:00:33,403 --> 00:00:35,103
Then what is it?

4
00:00:39,639 --> 00:00:41,973
You going with them?

5
00:00:42,008 --> 00:00:44,842
No, I'm gonna bury her.

6
00:00:44,877 --> 00:00:47,044
Let me help you.

7
00:00:47,079 --> 00:00:49,812
Help Sayid.

8
00:00:52,048 --> 00:00:55,484
Hey, Miles.

00:00:56,886 --> 00:00:58,553
You got it, boss.

10
00:00:58,587 --> 00:01:02,055
I'll make sure to leave a ail.

11
00:01:02,090 --> 00:01:04,957
I ain't followin' nobody,
kate.

12
00:01:12,598 --> 00:01:16,299
You guys ready?
Whenever you are.

13
00:01:47,659 --> 00:01:49,293
<i>oceanic passenger</i>

14
00:01:49,327 --> 00:01:51,161
<i>Jack shephard.</i>

15
00:01:51,196 --> 00:01:54,295
<i>Jack shephard, please go to
the nearest courtesy desk.</i>

16
00:01:55,697 --> 00:01:57,631
<i>attention
all arriving passengers...</i>

17
00:01:57,665 --> 00:01:59,099
Hi. Uh...

18
00:01:59,133 --> 00:02:01,434
I'm jack shephard.
I was just paged.

19
00:02:01,469 --> 00:02:03,236
Oh, mr. Shephard.

20
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:05,171
Hello. Yes, that was me.

21
00:02:05,205 --> 00:02:07,639
Uh, sorry, I meant
to meet you at the gate.

22
00:02:07,673 --> 00:02:10,007
Well, um, I'm here now,
so--

23
00:02:10,042 --> 00:02:11,975
Yes. Mr. Shephard,
I am deeply sorry,

24
00:02:12,010 --> 00:02:13,977
But there seems
to have been a mix-up

25
00:02:14,011 --> 00:02:16,745
Involving the, uh... Cargo
you checked in sydney.

26
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:18,414
Cargo?

27
00:02:18,448 --> 00:02:20,617
Yes,ir. A coffin.

28
00:02:20,652 --> 00:02:22,953
I don't...

29
00:02:22,988 --> 00:02:24,521
I don't understand.

30
00:02:24,556 --> 00:02:27,057
I mean, are--are you saying
that it's not here?

31
00:02:27,091 --> 00:02:29,425
It appears it was never
put on the plane.

32
00:02:31,194 --> 00:02:35,797
The funeral is in two hours.
When is it getting here?

33
00:02:35,832 --> 00:02:38,766
Mr. Shephard, I can't tell you
how deeply sorry we are.

34
00:02:38,801 --> 00:02:41,235
But we don't know
when it will arrive...

35
00:02:41,269 --> 00:02:44,771
Because we're not exactly sure
where it is.

36
00:03:09,126 --> 00:03:11,928
That's a big wall.

37
00:03:11,962 --> 00:03:14,829
How are we gonna get him
over the top?

38
00:03:16,297 --> 00:03:20,232
We're not. We're bringing him
in through here.

39
00:03:51,767 --> 00:03:54,537
Who brings a book into a cave?

40
00:04:01,677 --> 00:04:04,444
And why is his arm missing?

41
00:04:04,479 --> 00:04:08,248
It was ripped off when he was
attacked by the black smoke.

42
00:04:10,952 --> 00:04:13,720
Well... This is gonna
be awesome.

43
00:04:35,608 --> 00:04:37,309
now watch your step.

44
00:04:37,343 --> 00:04:38,643
Yeah.

45
00:04:44,147 --> 00:04:45,914
Okay.

46
00:05:23,483 --> 00:05:26,418
Where's kate?

47
00:05:26,452 --> 00:05:28,755
she's right over there.

48
00:05:28,790 --> 00:05:30,924
Kate?

49
00:05:33,795 --> 00:05:35,095
Kate!

50
00:05:37,098 --> 00:05:40,066
Can you hear me?!

51
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:42,434
Kate!

52
00:05:45,972 --> 00:05:48,006

00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:49,740

Hurley! Jin!

55
00:05:54,582 --> 00:05:56,249
Hurley!

56
00:06:23,508 --> 00:06:25,275
You okay?

57
00:06:25,309 --> 00:06:27,110
Yeah. You?
Yeah.

58
00:06:48,863 --> 00:06:51,695
Guess we found the temple.

59
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:56,569
Anything to declare?
Just aderer.

60
00:07:01,674 --> 00:07:02,908
Okay.

61
00:07:02,942 --> 00:07:05,377
I need to go
to the bathroom.

62
00:07:05,411 --> 00:07:07,747
Hold it.
I can't hold it.

63
00:07:07,781 --> 00:07:09,816
Sure you can, kiddo.
I believe in you.

64
00:07:09,850 --> 00:07:11,584
Edward...

65
00:07:11,618 --> 00:07:13,053
Please.

66
00:07:14,623 --> 00:07:16,392
All right. Come on.

67
00:07:18,061 --> 00:07:21,097
Anybody in here?

68
00:07:21,132 --> 00:07:23,066
Is anybody in
the ladies' room?

69
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:25,367
Don't move.

70
00:07:28,137 --> 00:07:29,938
Okay.

71
00:07:29,972 --> 00:07:31,573
You got two minutes.

72
00:07:31,607 --> 00:07:33,074
Thank you.

73
00:07:33,109 --> 00:07:34,776
Ocks door)

74
00:08:02,668 --> 00:08:04,835
You done?

75
00:08:04,869 --> 00:08:06,135
Not yet.

76
00:08:18,881 --> 00:08:21,616
All right, time's up!
Get out of there.

77
00:08:21,650 --> 00:08:23,984
One minute.
No, open this door right now.

78
00:08:24,019 --> 00:08:26,954
I'm not finished.
Yes, you are. Open it.

79
00:08:26,988 --> 00:08:29,522
austen, I swear to god,

80
00:08:29,557 --> 00:08:32,225
You don't open this door,
I'm coming in there--oh!

81
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:35,796
Uhh!

82
00:08:37,766 --> 00:08:40,967
Mm.

83
00:08:48,241 --> 00:08:51,576
Although I've seen it before,
it was something... Oh, my god.

84
00:08:51,611 --> 00:08:53,912
I, uh, he--he just
walked in here and attacked me.

85
00:08:53,946 --> 00:08:58,116
I shed h. I-just--
I need to get out of here.

86
00:09:04,963 --> 00:09:07,098
Officer, come quick.
Come quick.

87
00:09:07,132 --> 00:09:10,234
Wait, hold the door!

88
00:09:14,672 --> 00:09:17,173
Welcome aboard.

89
00:09:19,276 --> 00:09:22,677
We were on the same flight.
Sydney.

90
00:09:22,712 --> 00:09:24,479
How about that?

91
00:09:36,890 --> 00:09:39,925
ganson,
calhoun, what's your 20?

92
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:43,828
Uh, we're on theouth elevator,
headed to ground.

93
00:09:43,862 --> 00:09:46,564
Get your asses
to international baggage claim.

94
00:09:46,598 --> 00:09:49,332
We got a 341.
Yeah. We're on our way.

95
00:09:49,367 --> 00:09:51,000
Sounds serious.

96
00:09:51,035 --> 00:09:53,135
What's a 341?

97
00:09:53,169 --> 00:09:55,136
That's confidential, sir.
Well, if it's confidential,

98
00:09:55,170 --> 00:09:58,672
How the hell am I supposed to
know if I see one?

99
00:09:58,706 --> 00:10:01,206
Uh, sorry.

100
00:10:01,241 --> 00:10:03,175
Excuse me. Ladies first.

101
00:10:03,209 --> 00:10:04,843
Thanks.

102
00:10:04,877 --> 00:10:06,277
Take care.

103
00:10:19,258 --> 00:10:21,392
I think that'll do it,
boss.

104
00:10:21,427 --> 00:10:23,895
Stop calling me "boss."

105
00:10:23,929 --> 00:10:26,766
You ain't my deputy anymore.

106
00:10:26,801 --> 00:10:28,668
You got it.

107
00:10:28,702 --> 00:10:31,735
Are you thirsty? I think I saw
some beers in the van.

108
00:10:31,769 --> 00:10:34,369
Construction guys hid 'em
in the wheel well.

109
00:10:34,403 --> 00:10:37,338
Whathe want to tell me, Miles?
Excuse me?

110
00:10:37,372 --> 00:10:39,639
Juliet.

111
00:10:39,674 --> 00:10:42,742
She said she wanted to tell me
something, and then she died.

112
00:10:42,776 --> 00:10:44,377
What was it, miles?

113
00:10:44,411 --> 00:10:46,812
That's why you asked me
to stay here with you?

114
00:10:46,847 --> 00:10:50,182
You're the only one around
that talks to dead people.

115
00:10:52,752 --> 00:10:55,553
J-jim, that's not
how it works.

116
00:10:55,588 --> 00:10:57,655
What did she wanna
tell me, miles?

117
00:10:57,690 --> 00:11:00,524
<i>It... it doesn't matter.
It does matter.</i>

118
00:11:00,558 --> 00:11:03,060
It's not gonna help.
Just do it. Just ask her...

119
00:11:03,094 --> 00:11:05,294
She's gone, james.

120
00:11:07,331 --> 00:11:10,699
<i>I know she's gone. I know.</i>

121
00:11:10,734 --> 00:11:12,735
Now tell me.

122
00:11:14,604 --> 00:11:16,671
okay.

123
00:11:16,705 --> 00:11:18,072
Okay.

124
00:11:18,106 --> 00:11:19,407
Okay.

125
00:11:19,441 --> 00:11:21,342
All right.

126
00:11:21,376 --> 00:11:23,778
All right.

127
00:11:49,164 --> 00:11:50,431
What?

128
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,434
It worked.

129
00:11:53,468 --> 00:11:56,670
What did she want
to tell me?

130
00:11:56,704 --> 00:11:59,539
That's what she wanted
to tell you.

131
00:11:59,573 --> 00:12:01,240
"it worked."

132
00:12:11,082 --> 00:12:12,516
What worked?

133
00:12:30,068 --> 00:12:32,069
stop right here.

134
00:12:45,048 --> 00:12:47,015
who are you?

135
00:12:47,049 --> 00:12:49,850
I know who they are.

136
00:12:52,086 --> 00:12:54,921
They were on
the first plane...

137
00:12:54,955 --> 00:12:57,721
Eanic 815, along with me.

138
00:13:08,430 --> 00:13:10,197
You sure?

139
00:13:13,434 --> 00:13:14,968
Shoot 'em.

140
00:13:16,770 --> 00:13:20,006
Whoa! No, hey! No! No! No! No!
Jacob sent us! Jacob sent us!

141
00:13:22,642 --> 00:13:24,208
uh, what did--
what did you just say?

142
00:13:24,243 --> 00:13:27,245
I said jacob sent us.

143
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:29,680
He said you would help
our friend.

144
00:13:34,151 --> 00:13:36,486
He wants you to prove it.

145
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:39,188
Uh...

146
00:13:42,425 --> 00:13:46,028
no.
He gave me that guitar case!

147
00:13:50,465 --> 00:13:52,765
did you look inside it?

148
00:13:52,799 --> 00:13:53,966
Maybe.

149
00:14:25,222 --> 00:14:26,356
Dude!

150
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:42,907
what are your names?

151
00:14:42,941 --> 00:14:45,309
Hugo.

152
00:14:45,343 --> 00:14:46,644
Hugo reyes.

153
00:14:48,379 --> 00:14:50,447
Tell him.

154
00:14:50,481 --> 00:14:52,482
Jin-soo kwon.

155
00:14:53,984 --> 00:14:56,118
Kate austen.

156
00:14:56,152 --> 00:14:58,186
Jack shephard.

157
00:15:00,522 --> 00:15:02,556
What about him?

158
00:15:02,590 --> 00:15:04,157
Sayid jarrah.

159
00:15:17,271 --> 00:15:20,939
Pick him up.
Get him to the spring.

160
00:15:20,973 --> 00:15:23,140
Hey! Excuse me.

161
00:15:23,175 --> 00:15:25,242
I carried that case

162
00:15:25,277 --> 00:15:28,812
Across the ocean
and, like, through time,

163
00:15:28,847 --> 00:15:31,781
So I wanna know
what that paper says.

164
00:15:35,854 --> 00:15:39,456
That paper said that if
your friend there dies...

165
00:15:39,490 --> 00:15:41,858
We're all
in a lot of trouble.

166
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:53,867
And what business
are you in, sir?

167
00:15:53,901 --> 00:15:55,768
No english.

168
00:15:55,803 --> 00:15:59,440
<i>Be prepared to show
your passport to customs...</i>

169
00:16:02,410 --> 00:16:04,678
This letter says
the watch is a business gift.

170
00:16:04,713 --> 00:16:07,314
But can you tell me
what business you're in?

171
00:16:23,562 --> 00:16:25,262
Step back, sir.

172
00:16:34,603 --> 00:16:37,572
What are you doing
with this?

173
00:16:37,607 --> 00:16:41,680
Anything over $10,000
has to be declared.

174
00:16:41,714 --> 00:16:46,283
You... Didn't...
Declare this.

175
00:16:50,621 --> 00:16:52,722
Sir, you're gonna
have to come with me.

176
00:16:52,756 --> 00:16:54,690
Let's go have a talk--

177
00:16:54,725 --> 00:16:56,625
This way.

178
00:16:56,660 --> 00:17:00,327
Anne, taer
to the waiting area.

179
00:17:00,362 --> 00:17:01,495
Ms. Paik?

180
00:17:01,529 --> 00:17:03,830
Do you understand
any english?

181
00:17:03,864 --> 00:17:05,398
Because if you do,

182
00:17:05,432 --> 00:17:07,866
If this is just
a misunderstanding,

183
00:17:07,901 --> 00:17:10,034
You should speak up now.

184
00:17:12,103 --> 00:17:14,403
Do you understand me?

185
00:17:17,941 --> 00:17:20,876
No... English.

186
00:17:48,436 --> 00:17:50,370
The water isn't clear.

187
00:17:50,404 --> 00:17:51,638
What happened?

188
00:18:30,072 --> 00:18:31,973
What is he doing?

189
00:18:32,007 --> 00:18:33,607
I don't know.

190
00:18:43,316 --> 00:18:45,216
Who did this to him?

191
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:50,119
It's my fault. I-I didn't
shoot him, but it's my fault.

192
00:18:55,758 --> 00:18:58,259
If we do this,
there are risks.

193
00:19:02,831 --> 00:19:04,465
You understand?

194
00:19:04,499 --> 00:19:07,434
Do what you have to do.

195
00:19:13,707 --> 00:19:16,375
Take off the coveralls,
put him in.

196
00:19:53,305 --> 00:19:56,073
What are they doing?

197
00:19:57,976 --> 00:20:01,110
Can unconscious people
hold their breath? - No.

198
00:20:10,319 --> 00:20:12,954
He's awake. Let him up.

199
00:20:17,926 --> 00:20:20,327
What are they waiting for?

200
00:20:21,896 --> 00:20:23,163
That's enough!

201
00:20:25,498 --> 00:20:27,466
I said let him up!

202
00:20:32,772 --> 00:20:35,640
You're not saving him!
You're drowning him!

203
00:21:45,827 --> 00:21:47,895
Your friend is dead.

204
00:22:26,127 --> 00:22:27,627
Jack.

205
00:22:29,163 --> 00:22:31,097
Jack, stop what
you're doing.

206
00:22:41,072 --> 00:22:43,907
Jack, he's dead.

207
00:22:43,941 --> 00:22:48,511
He's not coming back.
Stop it!

There's a line!

220
00:24:27,669 --> 00:24:29,469
Sorry.

Well, it should've cleared.

224
00:24:37,615 --> 00:24:40,050
Outback's just a name.

225
00:24:40,084 --> 00:24:42,885
What are they saying,
they own the entire outback?

226
00:24:42,919 --> 00:24:44,319
That's just stupid.

227
00:24:44,354 --> 00:24:46,153
Have 'em cover it, okay?

228
00:24:46,187 --> 00:24:48,655
She's gonna
be coming out of customs,

229
00:24:48,689 --> 00:24:51,023
So I want you guys
to take the other door.

230
00:24:51,058 --> 00:24:54,659
Oh, I didn't get the, uh,
tustin inventory report yet.

231
00:24:54,693 --> 00:24:57,794
get on it.

232
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:04,566
Hey!

233
00:25:04,601 --> 00:25:07,801
hey! Watch it!

234
00:25:07,835 --> 00:25:10,002
Go! Go now!

235
00:25:10,037 --> 00:25:12,072
Lady, I already have
a customer.

236
00:25:12,107 --> 00:25:13,807
I said go.

237
00:25:13,841 --> 00:25:15,875
Hey, what are you doing?

238
00:25:15,910 --> 00:25:17,576
<i>Go now!</i>

239
00:25:20,380 --> 00:25:24,750
Hey! Hey! Stop the cab!

240
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:46,601
Thought you might like a little
something to eat or drink.

241
00:25:46,635 --> 00:25:49,771
Zack, emma, then take the rest
to the people over there.

242
00:25:49,805 --> 00:25:51,439
Thank you.

243
00:25:53,309 --> 00:25:55,610
just drop 'em in here.

244
00:26:01,383 --> 00:26:03,918
Hey. What happened?
(gasps

245
00:26:03,952 --> 00:26:07,487
they jumped us
in the jungle.

246
00:26:07,522 --> 00:26:09,823
He took four of them out

247
00:26:09,857 --> 00:26:12,258
Before one of them hit him
with a damn rock.

248
00:26:17,597 --> 00:26:19,864
You. Come with me.

249
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:23,334
Come with you where?

250
00:26:34,944 --> 00:26:38,212
He wants to know what
Jacob told you.

251
00:26:38,246 --> 00:26:40,613
He told me to come here,

252
00:26:40,647 --> 00:26:43,382
Said you guys would
save Sayid.

253
00:26:46,719 --> 00:26:48,687
he was beyond saving.

254
00:26:48,721 --> 00:26:50,488
Wait a sec.

255
00:26:50,523 --> 00:26:53,491
You're not translating
anhing I say to him,

256
00:26:53,525 --> 00:26:55,426
Which means you totally
understand me, dude.

257
00:26:55,460 --> 00:26:59,697
I don't like the way
english tastes on my tongue.

258
00:27:02,467 --> 00:27:05,233
When's Jacob getting here?
What do you mean?

259
00:27:05,267 --> 00:27:07,301
Is he coming to the temple?

260
00:27:07,336 --> 00:27:10,771
I really don't think
that's gonna happen, man.

261
00:27:10,805 --> 00:27:12,139
Why not?

262
00:27:12,173 --> 00:27:14,641
You know... 'cause he's dead.

263
00:27:18,479 --> 00:27:20,247
What?

264
00:27:20,281 --> 00:27:22,816
You guys didn't know?

265
00:27:28,490 --> 00:27:31,293
everyone to your posts!

266
00:27:31,327 --> 00:27:34,528
On the walls!
Prepare the ash!

267
00:27:46,274 --> 00:27:48,408
Ten men to the north side!

268
00:27:50,577 --> 00:27:52,679
Send the warning!

269
00:27:54,682 --> 00:27:56,049
Light it!

270
00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:12,449
Guess we're not
getting out of here, huh?

271
00:28:12,450 --> 00:28:16,000
<i>This isn't to keep you in.
It's to keep him out.</i>

272
00:28:16,054 --> 00:28:17,754
"him" who?

273
00:28:31,970 --> 00:28:33,868
What are you?

274
00:28:33,902 --> 00:28:37,303
I'm not a "what," ben.
I'm a "who."

275
00:28:37,338 --> 00:28:39,371
You're the monster.

276
00:28:39,406 --> 00:28:43,107
Let's not resort
to name-calling.

277
00:28:49,815 --> 00:28:51,582
You used me.

278
00:28:53,418 --> 00:28:55,986
You couldn't kill him
yourself,

279
00:28:56,020 --> 00:28:58,254
So you made me do it.

280
00:28:58,288 --> 00:29:01,423
I didn't make you do
anything.

281
00:29:03,826 --> 00:29:07,528
You should know...

282
00:29:07,563 --> 00:29:09,963
He was very confused
when you killed him.

283
00:29:09,998 --> 00:29:12,732
I seriously doubt
that jacob was ever confused.

284
00:29:12,766 --> 00:29:15,467
I'm not talking about jacob.

285
00:29:17,370 --> 00:29:19,804
I'm talking about john locke.

286
00:29:21,607 --> 00:29:25,175
Do you wanna know what
he was thinking while you...

287
00:29:25,209 --> 00:29:28,010
Choked t life out of him,
Benjamin?

288
00:29:28,044 --> 00:29:31,078
What the last thought
that ran through his head was?

289
00:29:31,113 --> 00:29:35,051
"I don't understand."

290
00:29:38,055 --> 00:29:40,923
Isn't that just the saddest
thing you ever heard?

291
00:29:43,593 --> 00:29:45,961
But it's fitting in a way.

292
00:29:45,996 --> 00:29:48,764
Because when john first came
to the island,

293
00:29:48,799 --> 00:29:51,267
He was a very sad man.

294
00:29:51,301 --> 00:29:53,002
A victim

295
00:29:53,036 --> 00:29:56,071
Shouting at the world for being
told what he couldn't do--

296
00:29:56,106 --> 00:29:58,107
Even though they were right.

297
00:29:58,141 --> 00:30:00,808
He was weak

298
00:30:00,843 --> 00:30:06,380
And pathetic
and irreparably broken.

299
00:30:06,414 --> 00:30:09,216
But despite all that,

300
00:30:09,250 --> 00:30:11,785
There was something admirable
about him.

301
00:30:11,819 --> 00:30:16,056
He was the only one of them
who didn't want to leave.

302
00:30:16,090 --> 00:30:18,157
The only one who realized

303
00:30:18,192 --> 00:30:21,661
How pitiful
the life he'd left behind

304
00:30:21,696 --> 00:30:23,830
Actually was.

305
00:30:28,869 --> 00:30:30,336
Hmm.

306
00:30:32,639 --> 00:30:34,373
What do you want?

307
00:30:34,407 --> 00:30:37,710
Well, that's
the great irony here, ben,

308
00:30:37,744 --> 00:30:39,545
Because...

309
00:30:39,579 --> 00:30:42,648
I want the one thing
that John Locke didn't.

310
00:30:44,318 --> 00:30:48,554
I want to go home.

311
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:03,034
Good-bye, dude.

312
00:31:03,668 --> 00:31:06,803
If you ever wanna talk,

313
00:31:06,837 --> 00:31:10,239
I'm around.

314
00:31:18,409 --> 00:31:19,909
What?

315
00:31:21,712 --> 00:31:23,345
Nothing.

316
00:31:37,588 --> 00:31:39,556
Hey.

317
00:31:41,593 --> 00:31:42,760
Where are we?

318
00:31:44,594 --> 00:31:46,695
We're in a temple.

319
00:31:46,729 --> 00:31:49,564
We got caught
by the others again.

320
00:31:49,598 --> 00:31:50,598
Yeah.

321
00:31:50,633 --> 00:31:54,168
Only this time,
they're protecting us.

322
00:31:54,302 --> 00:31:57,103
I think.

323
00:31:57,138 --> 00:31:59,238
of course they are.

324
00:31:59,272 --> 00:32:01,440
You all right?

325
00:32:07,312 --> 00:32:09,779
I'm so sorry.

326
00:32:24,028 --> 00:32:27,096
You know what you said
back at the hatch?

327
00:32:27,130 --> 00:32:29,464
He's just trying to help us.

328
00:32:30,933 --> 00:32:33,301
I ain't gonna kill Jack.

329
00:32:35,738 --> 00:32:38,240
He deserves
to suffer on this rock

330
00:32:38,308 --> 00:32:40,778
Just like the rest of us.

331
00:32:44,616 --> 00:32:46,650
Yeah.

332
00:32:46,684 --> 00:32:51,220
<i>I know, and--you think
I knew this was gonna happen?</i>

333
00:32:51,254 --> 00:32:54,590
I scheduled it so soon because
want to get it over with.

334
00:32:54,624 --> 00:32:56,492
<i>attention all passengers...</i>

335
00:32:56,526 --> 00:32:58,027
I don't know, mom.

336
00:32:58,061 --> 00:33:01,029
He's not here, so I can't
tell you what to tell them,

337
00:33:01,064 --> 00:33:04,499
Other than we can't
have the service without him.

338
00:33:04,533 --> 00:33:05,633
Yeah.

339
00:33:05,667 --> 00:33:09,036
I will call you
if I hear anything.

340
00:33:11,540 --> 00:33:14,476
<i>What did you lose?</i>

341
00:33:15,779 --> 00:33:18,946
Oh, they lost one of my bags.
What about you?

342
00:33:18,981 --> 00:33:22,883
you wouldn't believe me
if I told you.

343
00:33:22,917 --> 00:33:24,484
try me.

344
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:29,088
They lost my father.

345
00:33:29,122 --> 00:33:31,256
I'm sorry?

346
00:33:31,291 --> 00:33:33,760
He died in australia
a couple days ago,

347
00:33:33,794 --> 00:33:36,464
And, um, I flew down
to get him.

348
00:33:40,403 --> 00:33:42,873
My condolences.

349
00:33:42,907 --> 00:33:44,141
Yo.

350
00:33:44,175 --> 00:33:46,310
The coffin was supposed
to go on thelane in Sydney,

351
00:33:46,345 --> 00:33:47,745
But it didn't.

352
00:33:47,780 --> 00:33:49,414
Apparently,
he's somewhere in transit,

353
00:33:49,449 --> 00:33:50,450
Which is their way of saying

354
00:33:50,484 --> 00:33:54,886
They have no idea where the hell he is.
Well, how could they know?

355
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:57,921
Well, they're the ones
that checked him in.

356
00:33:57,955 --> 00:34:00,957
I mean, they've gotta have
some kind of tracking system.

357
00:34:00,991 --> 00:34:03,593
No, I'm not talking about
the coffin.

358
00:34:03,627 --> 00:34:05,995
I mean, how could they know
where he is?

359
00:34:06,029 --> 00:34:10,465
They didn't lose your father.
They just lost his body.

360
00:34:21,779 --> 00:34:24,682
Either way, your story
beats the hell out of mine.

361
00:34:24,716 --> 00:34:26,883
All that was in my suitcase
was a bunch of knives.

362
00:34:26,918 --> 00:34:28,018
Thanks.

363
00:34:28,052 --> 00:34:29,986
You some kind of salesman?

364
00:34:30,020 --> 00:34:32,121
Yeah, somethin' like that.

365
00:34:34,590 --> 00:34:38,158
Well, it's nice talking to you.
I-I hope you find that coffin.

366
00:34:38,192 --> 00:34:41,193
I hope you find your knives.

367
00:34:41,227 --> 00:34:42,461
Yeah, thanks.

368
00:34:42,495 --> 00:34:44,863
Mind if I ask
what happened to you?

369
00:34:46,532 --> 00:34:49,601
I'm sorry. I'mnly asking
because I'm a spinal surgeon.

370
00:34:49,635 --> 00:34:51,669
I-I didn't mean to...

371
00:34:51,703 --> 00:34:53,704
Oh, no, don't worry
about it. Uh...

372
00:34:53,738 --> 00:34:56,006
Uh, surgery isn't gonna
do anythg to help me.

373
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:58,774
Uh, my conditi
is irreversible.

374
00:34:58,809 --> 00:35:01,577
Nothing's irreversible.

375
00:35:06,815 --> 00:35:09,784
Um...

376
00:35:09,818 --> 00:35:14,823
If you ever want a consult...
Just, uh, give me a call.

377
00:35:16,425 --> 00:35:18,892
It's on the house.

378
00:35:18,927 --> 00:35:22,428
Well, thanks.

379
00:35:22,463 --> 00:35:24,096

00:35:33,939 --> 00:35:35,606

383
00:35:43,413 --> 00:35:46,849

384
00:36:09,035 --> 00:36:11,602
Don't shoot him!
Don't shoot him!

385
00:36:13,872 --> 00:36:15,738
I'm seein' it,

386
00:36:15,773 --> 00:36:18,140
But I'm still not
believin' it.

387
00:36:21,578 --> 00:36:24,012
Hello, Richard.

388
00:36:25,047 --> 00:36:27,981
It's good to see you
out of those chains.

389
00:36:32,986 --> 00:36:34,220
You?

390
00:36:34,254 --> 00:36:35,254
Me.

391
00:36:48,466 --> 00:36:53,135
I am very disappointed...
In all of you.

392
00:37:35,704 --> 00:37:37,438
You're Shephard?

393
00:37:38,472 --> 00:37:40,673
We need to speak
to you privately.

394
00:37:43,576 --> 00:37:45,911
If you've got something
to say to me, then say it.

395
00:37:45,945 --> 00:37:48,446
Otherwise,
just leave me alone.

396
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:50,514
I don't think you're
understanding me here.

397
00:37:50,548 --> 00:37:52,015
I'm asking politely.

398
00:37:52,049 --> 00:37:55,251
You either get up
and come with us on your own,

399
00:37:55,285 --> 00:37:57,220
Or I'll have you dragged out.

400
00:37:57,254 --> 00:37:59,222
Because we are going
to have this conversation,

401
00:37:59,256 --> 00:38:02,924
And it's not going
to be here. - Is that right?

402
00:38:11,032 --> 00:38:12,366
Jack!

403
00:38:13,968 --> 00:38:17,370
Oh, my god.

404
00:38:21,507 --> 00:38:23,275
what...

405
00:38:26,645 --> 00:38:28,513
What happened?
