1
00:00:00,389 --> 00:00:01,524
Previously on Lost.

2
00:00:05,603 --> 00:00:07,070
Son of a bitch.

3
00:00:28,092 --> 00:00:30,330
We're gonna get you to
the hospital. Mr. Locke?

4
00:00:30,364 --> 00:00:31,832
Mr. Locke?

5
00:00:31,867 --> 00:00:33,670
You found what they
were hiding in the submarine.

6
00:00:33,704 --> 00:00:36,409
I most certainly did.

7
00:00:43,031 --> 00:00:44,931
Aah!

8
00:00:44,966 --> 00:00:47,269
- Hello, Hugo.
- We have to talk to you.

9
00:00:47,303 --> 00:00:48,604
"We"?

10
00:00:48,639 --> 00:00:49,873
Okay, guys.

11
00:00:49,907 --> 00:00:51,475
Come on out.

12
00:01:05,121 --> 00:01:06,984
Hello, Jack.

13
00:01:08,018 --> 00:01:11,456
I was hoping you'd come.

14
00:01:16,531 --> 00:01:19,202
I think we have some
catching up to do.

15
00:01:28,011 --> 00:01:30,148
Hurley...

16
00:01:30,182 --> 00:01:32,317
this was your idea.

17
00:01:32,351 --> 00:01:36,589
You all right with me
talking with him alone?

18
00:01:36,624 --> 00:01:38,959
It's all you, dude.

19
00:01:40,930 --> 00:01:42,965
All right, let's catch up.

20
00:02:00,018 --> 00:02:01,919
You look just like him.

21
00:02:01,954 --> 00:02:03,622
Does it bother you?

22
00:02:03,657 --> 00:02:05,558
No, what bothers me
is I don't have any

23
00:02:05,593 --> 00:02:07,562
idea what the hell you are.

24
00:02:07,593 --> 00:02:09,562
Sure you do.

25
00:02:15,562 --> 00:02:17,930
Why John Locke?

26
00:02:17,964 --> 00:02:20,362
Because he was stupid
enough to believe that

27
00:02:20,396 --> 00:02:22,695
he'd been brought
here for a reason.

28
00:02:22,730 --> 00:02:26,263
Because he pursued that belief
until it got him killed...

29
00:02:26,298 --> 00:02:28,197
and because you were
kind enough to bring his

30
00:02:28,231 --> 00:02:30,598
body back here in
a nice wooden box.

31
00:02:30,632 --> 00:02:33,567
He had to be dead before
you could look like him.

32
00:02:33,602 --> 00:02:35,003
That's right.

33
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:40,774
Who else have you looked like?

34
00:02:40,809 --> 00:02:44,211
Jack, what do you
really want to ask me?

35
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:49,950
The third day we
were here, I saw...

36
00:02:49,984 --> 00:02:51,885
I chased my father through
the jungle... my...

37
00:02:51,919 --> 00:02:53,487
my dead father.

38
00:02:55,523 --> 00:02:57,724
Was that you?

39
00:02:57,758 --> 00:03:00,927
Yes, that was me.

40
00:03:05,366 --> 00:03:07,300
Why?

41
00:03:07,334 --> 00:03:09,503
You needed to find water.

42
00:03:11,673 --> 00:03:14,141
This may be hard for
you to believe, Jack...

43
00:03:14,175 --> 00:03:17,511
but all I've ever been
interested in is helping you.

44
00:03:17,545 --> 00:03:20,380
To help me?

45
00:03:20,414 --> 00:03:22,015
To do what?

46
00:03:22,049 --> 00:03:24,250
Leave.

47
00:03:24,284 --> 00:03:26,185
But because Jacob chose you...

48
00:03:26,219 --> 00:03:29,221
you were trapped on this island
before you even got here.

49
00:03:32,626 --> 00:03:34,727
But now Jacob's dead,

50
00:03:34,761 --> 00:03:36,696
we don't have to
be trapped anymore.

51
00:03:36,730 --> 00:03:39,832
We can get on an airplane and
fly away anytime we want to.

52
00:03:39,866 --> 00:03:42,735
And if we can just fly
away whenever we want,

53
00:03:42,769 --> 00:03:44,603
why are you still here?

54
00:03:44,637 --> 00:03:48,306
Because it has to be all of us.

55
00:03:53,879 --> 00:03:56,081
What?

56
00:03:56,115 --> 00:03:58,383
John Locke was the
only one of us

57
00:03:58,417 --> 00:04:00,618
that ever believed
in this place.

58
00:04:00,653 --> 00:04:02,286
He did everything
he could to keep us

59
00:04:02,291 --> 00:04:03,589
from leaving this island.

60
00:04:03,623 --> 00:04:07,392
John Locke was not
a believer, Jack.

61
00:04:07,426 --> 00:04:09,494
He was a sucker.

62
00:04:13,131 --> 00:04:15,765
Sinus tach at 130, B.P. Dropping.

63
00:04:15,799 --> 00:04:17,732
Last read was 62 over 30,

64
00:04:17,766 --> 00:04:21,234
- possibly due to internal bleeding.
- Any signs of neurological damage?

65
00:04:21,269 --> 00:04:23,235
No response in lower reflexes.

66
00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:25,471
- That's because he's a paraplegic.
- You know this man?

67
00:04:25,505 --> 00:04:28,173
Yes. He's a substitute teacher
at my school. His name is...

68
00:04:28,207 --> 00:04:30,975
Locke. Mr. Locke.
I don't know his first name...

69
00:04:31,009 --> 00:04:32,476
but he uses a wheelchair.
Where is it?

70
00:04:32,510 --> 00:04:34,877
Smashed to pieces. That thing
probably saved his life.

71
00:04:34,912 --> 00:04:36,845
I saw the man that did this,
the... the hit-and-run driver.

72
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:38,080
He... he was at our school.

73
00:04:38,090 --> 00:04:39,690
When we get to the hospital,
you can talk to the cops.

74
00:04:39,715 --> 00:04:41,317
But do you know anyone
we can contact for him?

75
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:44,317
I have no idea. Like I
said, I barely know him.

76
00:04:44,551 --> 00:04:47,218
- Helen.
- What did you say?

77
00:04:47,252 --> 00:04:49,920
Helen Norwood.

78
00:04:49,955 --> 00:04:52,755
I was... gonna marry her.

79
00:04:52,789 --> 00:04:55,156
Well...

80
00:04:55,191 --> 00:04:57,091
you're still gonna marry her

81
00:04:57,125 --> 00:04:59,393
'cause you're gonna
be okay, Mr. Locke.

82
00:04:59,428 --> 00:05:01,028
John...

83
00:05:01,062 --> 00:05:04,097
my name is John.

84
00:05:04,132 --> 00:05:06,100
Blunt force trauma victim,
late 40s male.

85
00:05:06,134 --> 00:05:08,902
- He needs a C.T. scan.
- We got a gunshot wound here. Female.

86
00:05:08,936 --> 00:05:10,904
- Entry wound... upper right quadrant.
- Baby! Baby!

87
00:05:10,938 --> 00:05:12,439
Yes, sir. I understand
she's pregnant.

88
00:05:12,473 --> 00:05:14,708
- We're gonna take good care of her.
- Baby!

89
00:05:14,742 --> 00:05:16,476
- 500 lost cc's. External blood loss.
- Baby!

90
00:05:16,511 --> 00:05:19,079
we're gonna do
everything we can.

91
00:05:21,113 --> 00:05:23,181

92
00:05:23,215 --> 00:05:24,682

93
00:05:40,293 --> 00:05:43,294
What is it?

94
00:05:43,329 --> 00:05:44,729
You can come out.

95
00:05:51,136 --> 00:05:55,106
You following us, Claire?

96
00:05:55,140 --> 00:05:56,873
Yeah.

97
00:05:56,908 --> 00:05:58,041
Why?

98
00:05:58,076 --> 00:06:00,243
'Cause he's my brother.

99
00:06:04,447 --> 00:06:07,281
Looks like you two have a
lot of catching up to do.

100
00:06:07,316 --> 00:06:09,250
I'll leave you to it.

101
00:06:15,827 --> 00:06:18,630
Claire, I'm...
I'm so sorry tha...

102
00:06:18,664 --> 00:06:20,966
Did he tell you?

103
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,037
That he was the one
pretending to be our father?

104
00:06:24,071 --> 00:06:26,105
Yeah.

105
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:27,875
Yeah, he told me.

106
00:06:30,111 --> 00:06:32,512
You know, I pretty
much gave up hoping

107
00:06:32,546 --> 00:06:34,514
that you'd ever come back.

108
00:06:34,548 --> 00:06:36,849
Now that you're here...

109
00:06:39,086 --> 00:06:41,820
it's... it's good
to see you, Jack.

110
00:06:41,855 --> 00:06:45,223
Yeah, it's good to see you, too.

111
00:06:45,258 --> 00:06:48,426
You know, I... I never really had
much in the way of family,

112
00:06:48,461 --> 00:06:52,496
so it... really means a lot
that you're coming with us.

113
00:06:55,767 --> 00:06:59,436
Actually, I haven't... I haven't
decided if I'm coming with you.

114
00:07:01,271 --> 00:07:02,972
Yeah, you have.

115
00:07:03,006 --> 00:07:05,174
What do you mean?

116
00:07:05,208 --> 00:07:08,676
You decided the moment
you let him talk to you,

117
00:07:08,711 --> 00:07:11,111
just like the rest of us.

118
00:07:11,145 --> 00:07:13,346
So... you know,

119
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:15,381
whether you like it or not...

120
00:07:15,449 --> 00:07:17,416
you're with him now.

121
00:07:25,856 --> 00:07:28,824
Season 6 Episode 13
"The Last Recruit"

122
00:07:36,791 --> 00:07:38,425
He's got a submarine?

123
00:07:38,459 --> 00:07:40,426
keep your voice down, damn it.

124
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:42,928
Yeah, Widmore's got a sub.

125
00:07:42,962 --> 00:07:44,164
We're using it to
get off this rock.

126
00:07:46,262 --> 00:07:48,164
Are we gonna tell Sun?

127
00:07:48,198 --> 00:07:50,032
Kate's telling her now.

128
00:07:50,067 --> 00:07:52,367
I thought we might
want to avoid huddles.

129
00:07:52,402 --> 00:07:55,170
What about Sayid?

130
00:07:55,204 --> 00:07:58,173
Sayid ain't invited.
He's gone over to the dark side.

131
00:07:58,207 --> 00:08:01,242
Yeah, but you can always bring
people back from the dark side.

132
00:08:01,277 --> 00:08:03,878
- I mean, Anakin...
- Who the hell's Anakin?

133
00:08:03,945 --> 00:08:07,414
Look, just keep your mouth shut.
Don't say nothin' to no one.

134
00:08:07,448 --> 00:08:09,116
Hey.

135
00:08:10,150 --> 00:08:11,717
Hey, Claire.

136
00:08:11,751 --> 00:08:13,285
Hey, Hurley.

137
00:08:13,319 --> 00:08:14,819
You look great.

138
00:08:30,533 --> 00:08:34,001
It's so nice to have
everyone back together again.

139
00:08:45,145 --> 00:08:47,580
Want an apple?

140
00:08:47,614 --> 00:08:50,148
Hey, Schaub, I'm the
one who brought her in.

141
00:08:50,183 --> 00:08:52,183
Wanna give us a minute?

142
00:09:03,862 --> 00:09:05,796
Katherine Anne Austen.

143
00:09:05,830 --> 00:09:10,100
Wanted for arson, assault
on a federal officer...

144
00:09:10,134 --> 00:09:12,335
murder in the first degree.

145
00:09:14,873 --> 00:09:18,241
Funny. You don't strike
me as the murdering kind.

146
00:09:18,276 --> 00:09:20,510
That's because I'm not.

147
00:09:20,545 --> 00:09:24,180
You be sure and mention that
to the feds when they get here.

148
00:09:24,214 --> 00:09:26,248
Is there something you wanted?

149
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:32,855
You remember me...
from the airport?

150
00:09:32,889 --> 00:09:35,790
We were on the same
flight from Sydney.

151
00:09:35,825 --> 00:09:37,658
Yeah, I remember.

152
00:09:39,729 --> 00:09:42,197
Well, don't you
think it's weird...

153
00:09:42,231 --> 00:09:44,098
you and me being
on the same flight,

154
00:09:44,099 --> 00:09:46,767
having that little
meet-up in the elevator?

155
00:09:46,801 --> 00:09:47,969
And a week later... boom.

156
00:09:48,070 --> 00:09:51,972
Of all the cars in Los Angeles,
you smash into mine.

157
00:09:52,006 --> 00:09:54,941
Almost like someone's
trying to put us together.

158
00:09:54,975 --> 00:09:57,377
Are you hitting on me?

159
00:09:57,411 --> 00:09:59,312
It'd never work, sweetheart.

160
00:09:59,346 --> 00:10:02,315
- I'm a cop, you're a murderer...
- I already told you. I'm not a murderer.

161
00:10:02,349 --> 00:10:04,851
Yeah, well, I'm still a cop.

162
00:10:04,885 --> 00:10:07,554
So why didn't you arrest me?

163
00:10:09,289 --> 00:10:13,624
- I did arrest you.
- No, in L.A.X... the elevator.

164
00:10:11,658 --> 00:10:13,626

165
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:15,828
You saw I was wearing handcuffs.

166
00:10:15,863 --> 00:10:18,130
I didn't see any handcuffs.

167
00:10:19,666 --> 00:10:21,333
All I saw was a pretty lady

168
00:10:21,367 --> 00:10:23,902
who needed the door
held open for her.

169
00:10:23,936 --> 00:10:25,871
You know what I think?

170
00:10:25,905 --> 00:10:28,806
I think you let me go because
you went to Australia,

171
00:10:28,841 --> 00:10:31,776
and you didn't want anyone
to know you were there.

172
00:10:34,713 --> 00:10:38,816
Should I tell that to the feds
when they get here?

173
00:10:44,887 --> 00:10:46,587
- Oh, I like you.
- Oh.

174
00:10:46,621 --> 00:10:48,989
Jim. Got a live one, come on.

175
00:10:49,023 --> 00:10:51,324
Sorry...

176
00:10:51,358 --> 00:10:54,658
duty calls.

177
00:10:54,692 --> 00:10:57,858
We caught a multiple
homicide at a restaurant.

178
00:10:57,892 --> 00:10:59,894
Victims were a
lowlife named Keamy

179
00:10:59,928 --> 00:11:01,730
and three goons on his payroll.

180
00:11:01,765 --> 00:11:03,733
Korean female G.S.W. at the scene,

181
00:11:03,767 --> 00:11:06,502
and her boyfriend witnessed it,
but he doesn't speak English.

182
00:11:06,569 --> 00:11:07,668
Any suspects?

183
00:11:07,703 --> 00:11:09,669
Yeah, an A.T.M. surveillance camera

184
00:11:09,704 --> 00:11:11,903
grabbed this jaboney
fleeing the scene.

185
00:11:11,937 --> 00:11:14,236
All righty.
Put a name to that face.

186
00:11:16,272 --> 00:11:19,406
That's our bad guy.

187
00:11:29,548 --> 00:11:32,817
He's different now.

188
00:11:32,851 --> 00:11:36,185
Guess we're all different now.

189
00:11:44,226 --> 00:11:46,427
So what did Locke say to you?

190
00:11:46,461 --> 00:11:48,796
He said that he wants to leave...

191
00:11:48,830 --> 00:11:50,798
and we all have to go together.

192
00:11:50,832 --> 00:11:54,134
- And do you believe him?
- I'm not sure yet.

193
00:11:55,602 --> 00:11:58,137
Hands up.

194
00:11:58,172 --> 00:11:59,806
Stop right there.

195
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:01,841
Where's the man in charge?

196
00:12:01,875 --> 00:12:03,275
Who's she?

197
00:12:03,309 --> 00:12:04,876
That's Widmore's number two.

198
00:12:13,417 --> 00:12:15,885
What can I do for you?

199
00:12:15,919 --> 00:12:18,921
You took something from
us... and we want it back.

200
00:12:20,456 --> 00:12:23,324
I'm sorry. I don't know
what you're talking about.

201
00:12:25,627 --> 00:12:27,328
It's okay.

202
00:12:28,963 --> 00:12:31,832
- Do you have a fix on my position?
- Roger that.

203
00:12:33,769 --> 00:12:36,004
Show them what we're capable of.

204
00:12:50,114 --> 00:12:53,983
You have until nightfall
to return what you took.

205
00:12:54,017 --> 00:12:56,418
Or next time... we won't miss.

206
00:13:00,156 --> 00:13:03,091
Call me when you're ready
for us to pick him up.

207
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:21,708
Well...

208
00:13:21,742 --> 00:13:24,110
here we go.

209
00:13:38,176 --> 00:13:40,110
Uh, hi. I have an appointment

210
00:13:40,145 --> 00:13:42,078
with the Western
Pacific adoption agency.

211
00:13:42,113 --> 00:13:44,047
15th floor. And sign in, please.

212
00:13:44,081 --> 00:13:45,215
Sure.

213
00:13:48,151 --> 00:13:49,985
Hey there.

214
00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:51,486
How are you?

215
00:13:51,521 --> 00:13:53,956
Uh, we met at the airport...
the... uh, the baggage claim.

216
00:13:53,990 --> 00:13:55,924
- Oh, yeah. Hi.
- Nice.

217
00:13:55,959 --> 00:13:58,460
Hi. I'm Desmond.
Desmond Hume.

218
00:13:58,495 --> 00:14:00,362
Um, I never got your name. Uh...

219
00:14:00,396 --> 00:14:01,630
"Claire Littleton."

220
00:14:01,664 --> 00:14:03,232
So... so how you doin'?

221
00:14:03,267 --> 00:14:07,135
Um, I'm okay. Better now.
I actually had a bit of a scare,

222
00:14:07,170 --> 00:14:09,671
- ended up in the hospital.
- Oh, no. I'm sorry. Are you...

223
00:14:09,705 --> 00:14:12,240
Oh, no. It's all good now, so...

224
00:14:12,274 --> 00:14:15,777
Oh, by the way... uh,
you were right...

225
00:14:15,811 --> 00:14:17,478
it's a boy.

226
00:14:17,513 --> 00:14:19,181
I have a nose for these things.

227
00:14:20,216 --> 00:14:22,316
Look, um...

228
00:14:22,350 --> 00:14:25,250
excuse me if this sounds
a bit personal... but, um,

229
00:14:25,284 --> 00:14:26,882
I couldn't help noticing

230
00:14:26,917 --> 00:14:29,316
you're going to an
adoption agency... alone.

231
00:14:29,350 --> 00:14:32,781
Uh... yeah. You're right.
It is personal.

232
00:14:32,816 --> 00:14:35,716
No, I just meant you should
have some... some legal representation.

233
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:37,384
What, are you a lawyer?

234
00:14:37,418 --> 00:14:38,885
No. No.

235
00:14:38,919 --> 00:14:42,021
But, uh, it just so happens
that I'm on my way to see one.

236
00:14:42,055 --> 00:14:46,425
You know, adoption
contracts are complicated.

237
00:14:46,459 --> 00:14:48,426
And you should be careful

238
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:50,394
because you could find
yourself in a situation

239
00:14:50,429 --> 00:14:51,896
that's irreversible.

240
00:14:51,930 --> 00:14:54,597
Yeah, I-I don't have
money for a lawyer.

241
00:15:00,269 --> 00:15:01,969
What floor?

242
00:15:02,004 --> 00:15:04,772
Um... I'm-
I'm going to 15 as well.

243
00:15:07,642 --> 00:15:10,443
Look... this, um, this attorney
I'm seeing... she's excellent.

244
00:15:10,478 --> 00:15:12,678
Uh, you know... plus,
she owes me a favor.

245
00:15:12,713 --> 00:15:14,447
So...

246
00:15:14,481 --> 00:15:16,882
why don't you just
come and meet her?

247
00:15:16,917 --> 00:15:19,918
You know, I think she
could really help you.

248
00:15:19,952 --> 00:15:22,153
Look, I promise you...

249
00:15:22,187 --> 00:15:24,822
it won't cost you a cent.

250
00:15:24,857 --> 00:15:26,757
Please.

251
00:15:26,792 --> 00:15:28,860
It'd be my absolute pleasure.

252
00:15:32,363 --> 00:15:35,533
Uh, sure.

253
00:15:35,567 --> 00:15:38,102
Great... this way.

254
00:15:41,371 --> 00:15:43,539
Thanks.

255
00:15:43,573 --> 00:15:46,274
Hi. Uh, Desmond Hume to
see Ms. Verdansky, please.

256
00:15:48,477 --> 00:15:50,478
Oh, yes. Mr. Hume.
She's expecting you.

257
00:15:50,512 --> 00:15:52,479
- Have a seat.
- Great.

258
00:15:52,514 --> 00:15:55,215
Hey, um... thank you.

259
00:15:55,249 --> 00:15:57,817
You're very welcome.

260
00:15:57,851 --> 00:16:00,152
- Desmond!
- Ah, Ilana.

261
00:16:00,187 --> 00:16:02,121

262
00:16:01,155 --> 00:16:03,089
Uh, Claire, this is Ilana.

263
00:16:03,124 --> 00:16:05,225
Ilana, I'd like you to
meet a friend of mine...

264
00:16:05,259 --> 00:16:07,293
Claire Littleton. Um...

265
00:16:08,328 --> 00:16:12,663
I was hoping you'd
be able to help her.

266
00:16:12,698 --> 00:16:14,298
I'm sorry.

267
00:16:14,332 --> 00:16:16,199
Claire Littleton from Australia?

268
00:16:16,234 --> 00:16:18,601
Um, do I know you?

269
00:16:18,635 --> 00:16:21,871
No, but this is
quite a coincidence.

270
00:16:21,905 --> 00:16:24,539
We've been looking for you.

271
00:16:26,042 --> 00:16:28,443
Desmond, do you mind if I
speak with Ms. Littleton alone

272
00:16:28,477 --> 00:16:30,745
for a few minutes?

273
00:16:30,779 --> 00:16:33,413
No. Absolutely fine.
Go right ahead.

274
00:16:43,590 --> 00:16:45,524
Listen up, everyone.

275
00:16:45,559 --> 00:16:47,126
Hey.

276
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:49,161
What's going on?

277
00:16:49,196 --> 00:16:51,062
People are trying
to kill us again.

278
00:16:51,097 --> 00:16:54,598
All this is happening a bit
sooner than I'd expected...

279
00:16:54,632 --> 00:16:57,033
but these people
have forced our hand.

280
00:16:57,068 --> 00:16:59,302
Claiming we stole
something from them...

281
00:16:59,336 --> 00:17:02,170
trying to provoke us
into a confrontation.

282
00:17:02,204 --> 00:17:05,239
Well, if that's what they want,
that's what they'll get.

283
00:17:05,273 --> 00:17:06,873
Gather your things.

284
00:17:06,908 --> 00:17:09,877
We're going to the other island
and we're getting on that plane.

285
00:17:09,912 --> 00:17:11,180
James, I need your
help with something.

286
00:17:13,614 --> 00:17:14,815
There's a boat moored

287
00:17:14,849 --> 00:17:17,284
just a few hours down
the shore from here.

288
00:17:17,319 --> 00:17:19,519
I want you to get it...
and meet the rest of us

289
00:17:19,554 --> 00:17:21,054
on the other side
of these bluffs.

290
00:17:21,188 --> 00:17:23,089
We'll all sail over to the
other island together.

291
00:17:23,123 --> 00:17:24,458
Can you do that, James?

292
00:17:24,523 --> 00:17:26,558
How come we're not all
heading for it together?

293
00:17:26,592 --> 00:17:28,159
The bigger the group,
the slower it moves.

294
00:17:28,193 --> 00:17:30,062
All right. I could use
another pair of hands.

295
00:17:30,193 --> 00:17:32,362
Take whoever you want.

296
00:17:32,397 --> 00:17:34,565
How about it, Freckles...
know anything about sailing?

297
00:17:34,599 --> 00:17:37,034
I know enough.

298
00:17:37,068 --> 00:17:38,604
Good. We'll be waitin' for you.

299
00:17:38,868 --> 00:17:40,504
Sayid, you got a minute?

300
00:17:50,380 --> 00:17:53,115
Can you give me a
hand with somethin'?

301
00:17:58,019 --> 00:18:00,420
Listen up, 'cause I'm
only gonna say this once.

302
00:18:00,454 --> 00:18:02,388
We're not going to that
rendezvous point

303
00:18:02,422 --> 00:18:04,588
to pick up Locke.
I got a deal with Widmore.

304
00:18:04,622 --> 00:18:06,223
What kind of deal?

305
00:18:06,257 --> 00:18:08,390
Just listen.
First chance you get...

306
00:18:08,424 --> 00:18:10,491
you double back,
hoof it to this spot.

307
00:18:10,525 --> 00:18:12,125
There's an old dock.

308
00:18:12,159 --> 00:18:14,726
Grab Hugo, Sun and Lapidus.
Kate and I will meet you there.

309
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,694
What about Sayid and Claire?

310
00:18:16,728 --> 00:18:18,629
Sayid's a zombie
and Claire's nuts.

311
00:18:18,664 --> 00:18:21,732
She gave up her ticket when
she tried to kill Kate...

312
00:18:21,766 --> 00:18:24,101
and I ain't gonna let
that happen again.

313
00:18:24,136 --> 00:18:27,575
That's Hugo, Sun and the pilot.
Only them... understand?

314
00:18:27,609 --> 00:18:30,312
But how am I supposed to get
us away from... from Locke?

315
00:18:30,346 --> 00:18:32,416
You figure it out.

316
00:18:38,888 --> 00:18:39,990
Ready to roll?

317
00:18:40,024 --> 00:18:43,359
- What was that all about?
- Guy talk.

318
00:18:49,166 --> 00:18:52,734
I need you to go out to
where I've got Desmond.

319
00:18:52,769 --> 00:18:55,337
I thought you weren't
going to give him back.

320
00:18:55,371 --> 00:18:56,604
I'm not...

321
00:18:56,639 --> 00:18:59,573
you're gonna kill him.

322
00:18:59,608 --> 00:19:02,476
And that's not gonna be
a problem... is it, Sayid?

323
00:19:02,510 --> 00:19:06,246
You do still want what
you asked me for, right?

324
00:19:08,115 --> 00:19:10,783
Yes, I do.

325
00:19:10,817 --> 00:19:12,784
Then go do what I said.

326
00:19:36,073 --> 00:19:39,208
So what did he offer you?

327
00:19:45,416 --> 00:19:48,685
If you're gonna shoot me
in cold blood, brother...

328
00:19:51,722 --> 00:19:52,556
I think I have a right to know

329
00:19:52,590 --> 00:19:56,458
what you're gettin'
in exchange for it.

330
00:19:56,492 --> 00:19:59,761
He told me I could get
something back I lost.

331
00:19:59,795 --> 00:20:02,330
And what did you lose?

332
00:20:02,364 --> 00:20:05,532
The woman I loved.

333
00:20:09,569 --> 00:20:11,436
And where is she now?

334
00:20:13,172 --> 00:20:14,538
Dead.

335
00:20:16,908 --> 00:20:19,742
And what makes you think
Locke can bring her back?

336
00:20:19,777 --> 00:20:22,478
I died...

337
00:20:22,512 --> 00:20:24,379
and he brought me back.

338
00:20:31,252 --> 00:20:33,119
So what will you tell her?

339
00:20:33,154 --> 00:20:35,655
What do you mean?

340
00:20:39,926 --> 00:20:41,826
This woman...

341
00:20:41,861 --> 00:20:44,996
when she asks you what you
did to be with her again...

342
00:20:50,202 --> 00:20:52,236
what will you tell her?

343
00:21:05,844 --> 00:21:08,079
Sayid.

344
00:21:08,113 --> 00:21:10,549
What's going on?

345
00:21:10,583 --> 00:21:12,951
Everything will be
okay for you now.

346
00:21:12,986 --> 00:21:15,354
I took care of it.

347
00:21:15,388 --> 00:21:18,156
What do you mean?
Where are you going?

348
00:21:18,191 --> 00:21:20,925
I have to leave.

349
00:21:20,959 --> 00:21:23,260
Did you hurt someone?

350
00:21:23,294 --> 00:21:25,928
Nadia... I'm leaving,

351
00:21:25,963 --> 00:21:28,797
and I'm never going to be
able to come back again.

352
00:21:32,168 --> 00:21:35,002
What did you do, Sayid?

353
00:21:35,036 --> 00:21:36,737
Stall them.

354
00:21:43,276 --> 00:21:45,310
Who is it?

355
00:21:45,345 --> 00:21:47,278
L.A.P.D.

356
00:21:47,313 --> 00:21:50,114
May I see some identification?

357
00:21:50,148 --> 00:21:52,116
Can you open the door, please?

358
00:21:56,454 --> 00:21:58,955
Mrs. Jarrah,
I'm Detective Straume.

359
00:21:58,990 --> 00:22:00,990
I need to ask you
some questions.

360
00:22:01,025 --> 00:22:03,559
Do you have a few minutes?

361
00:22:12,901 --> 00:22:15,869
That's good. Stay down.

362
00:22:15,904 --> 00:22:18,972
Sayid Jarrah?

363
00:22:21,708 --> 00:22:25,410
You're under arrest.

364
00:22:27,946 --> 00:22:29,512
There she blows.

365
00:22:35,751 --> 00:22:37,952
You ready to get wet?

366
00:22:37,986 --> 00:22:39,187
Oh.

367
00:22:39,221 --> 00:22:41,155
You sure this is a good idea?

368
00:22:41,189 --> 00:22:42,823
You see a bridge?

369
00:22:42,857 --> 00:22:46,391
- Going back to get Locke.
- Of course not.

370
00:22:46,426 --> 00:22:48,760
It's a terrible idea.
Which is why we ain't doing it.

371
00:22:48,794 --> 00:22:50,194
What?

372
00:22:50,229 --> 00:22:51,829
We're gonna ditch Locke.

373
00:22:51,863 --> 00:22:54,731
You, me, Jack, Hurley, Sun and
that pilot that looks like

374
00:22:54,765 --> 00:22:56,967
he's stepped off the set
of a Burt Reynolds movie.

375
00:22:58,002 --> 00:23:00,135
When were you planning
on telling me this?

376
00:23:00,170 --> 00:23:01,636
Now.

377
00:23:01,670 --> 00:23:04,839
Wait. You didn't say Claire.

378
00:23:04,873 --> 00:23:07,708
'Cause she ain't comin'.

379
00:23:07,743 --> 00:23:11,412
The Claire you came
back for is gone.

380
00:23:13,448 --> 00:23:15,882
I promised I would
bring her back.

381
00:23:15,917 --> 00:23:18,285
That was before she started
drinkin' Locke's kool-aid.

382
00:23:18,319 --> 00:23:20,654
She's dangerous.
You really want her around Aaron?

383
00:23:26,695 --> 00:23:29,264
Let's go. We ain't
got much time.

384
00:24:03,522 --> 00:24:05,257
Hey, Claire.

385
00:24:05,291 --> 00:24:06,691
Jack.

386
00:24:12,932 --> 00:24:16,034
How long have you
been with Locke?

387
00:24:16,069 --> 00:24:17,803
Ever since you left.

388
00:24:19,372 --> 00:24:21,973
So you trust him?

389
00:24:22,007 --> 00:24:23,875
Yeah.

390
00:24:23,909 --> 00:24:25,076
Why?

391
00:24:25,110 --> 00:24:27,878
'Cause he's the only one
that didn't abandon me.

392
00:24:38,256 --> 00:24:40,791
Sun... have you seen Sayid?

393
00:24:40,825 --> 00:24:43,960
He was supposed to catch up with
us about a half a mile back.

394
00:24:46,497 --> 00:24:49,432
Oh, the silent treatment?

395
00:24:58,141 --> 00:25:01,644
I'm sorry, Sun... but I
didn't do anything to you.

396
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:04,247
James should be
on his way by now.

397
00:25:04,281 --> 00:25:06,216
Just keep everyone
moving to the beach.

398
00:25:06,250 --> 00:25:08,285
- I'll catch up with you there.
- where are you going?

399
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:10,321
I wanna make sure
nobody got left behind.

400
00:25:16,525 --> 00:25:18,193
- Hurley, wait up.
- Yeah?

401
00:25:18,227 --> 00:25:20,094
Sun.

402
00:25:25,433 --> 00:25:27,533
We have to go now.

403
00:25:27,568 --> 00:25:29,001
- Go where?
- There's no time.

404
00:25:29,036 --> 00:25:30,904
We just gotta go. Follow me.

405
00:25:30,938 --> 00:25:32,539
Um, I think we should
stick to Sawyer's plan,

406
00:25:32,574 --> 00:25:34,975
- or he'll be really pissed.
- This is Sawyer's plan. Let's go.

407
00:25:53,959 --> 00:25:55,927
Sayid?

408
00:25:55,961 --> 00:25:57,661
Where have you been?

409
00:25:57,696 --> 00:25:59,930
Doing what you asked.

410
00:25:59,998 --> 00:26:02,563
Then what took you so long?

411
00:26:02,598 --> 00:26:04,928
I just shot an unarmed man.

412
00:26:04,963 --> 00:26:07,560
I needed a moment.

413
00:26:07,594 --> 00:26:09,427
Did you kill him, Sayid?

414
00:26:09,462 --> 00:26:12,762
Of course I did.

415
00:26:12,797 --> 00:26:14,696
Go and check if you like.

416
00:26:18,398 --> 00:26:20,199
Come on. We have
a boat to catch.

417
00:26:38,448 --> 00:26:41,082
I hope you know
where you're going...

418
00:26:41,117 --> 00:26:42,417
'cause that smoke thing
runs a hell of a lot

419
00:26:42,451 --> 00:26:43,585
faster than we do.

420
00:26:43,620 --> 00:26:45,421
Sawyer said there'd be a
dock around here somewhere.

421
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:47,421
There they are!

422
00:26:52,494 --> 00:26:54,528
Hey.

423
00:26:54,562 --> 00:26:57,564
All right. Let's go.
Everybody on-board. Let's go!

424
00:26:57,598 --> 00:26:58,633
We sailin' home on this, huh?

425
00:26:58,698 --> 00:27:00,633
Won't work... not without a bearing.

426
00:27:00,668 --> 00:27:02,501
For three years,
the only way Dharma folk

427
00:27:02,536 --> 00:27:04,435
ever got on or off
this island was by sub.

428
00:27:04,470 --> 00:27:06,470
So that's what we're doing.
Nice job, doc.

429
00:27:08,006 --> 00:27:09,606
Uh-oh.

430
00:27:14,577 --> 00:27:16,144
Where you going?

431
00:27:19,414 --> 00:27:20,981
Claire...

432
00:27:21,016 --> 00:27:23,583
It's okay.

433
00:27:23,618 --> 00:27:24,784
Kate.

434
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:29,087
We're leaving the island.

435
00:27:29,121 --> 00:27:32,657
Then, uh, why aren't
you waiting for John?

436
00:27:32,691 --> 00:27:34,191
Because that's not John.

437
00:27:34,225 --> 00:27:36,559
And whoever he is,
he's not one of us.

438
00:27:38,798 --> 00:27:41,667
Claire...

439
00:27:41,701 --> 00:27:43,601
come with us.

440
00:27:43,635 --> 00:27:45,870
I can get you back to Aaron.

441
00:27:45,904 --> 00:27:49,840
- Wait a damn min...
- Sawyer, shut up. She is coming or I'm not.

442
00:27:52,577 --> 00:27:54,509
Come with us, Claire.

443
00:27:56,511 --> 00:27:59,511
- John promised me...
- No, I'm promising you.

444
00:28:01,747 --> 00:28:04,715
I was there when he was born.

445
00:28:04,749 --> 00:28:06,716
And I never should've
raised him.

446
00:28:06,750 --> 00:28:08,417
It should've been you.

447
00:28:11,620 --> 00:28:15,922
I came back to get you so
you could be with him again.

448
00:28:15,956 --> 00:28:20,358
It's the only reason I came
back to the island, Claire.

449
00:28:20,393 --> 00:28:24,028
So, please, come with us.

450
00:28:24,062 --> 00:28:27,064
Let's go home.

451
00:28:34,105 --> 00:28:38,741
All right. Get on the boat
before Locke gets here.

452
00:28:45,980 --> 00:28:49,248
He finds out we're gone...

453
00:28:49,283 --> 00:28:52,017
he's gonna be mad.

454
00:29:00,225 --> 00:29:01,925

455
00:29:01,959 --> 00:29:04,159
It's your mom.

456
00:29:04,194 --> 00:29:06,095
Hey.

457
00:29:06,129 --> 00:29:08,933
Yeah, we just got here.

458
00:29:08,967 --> 00:29:10,567
Thank you.

459
00:29:10,601 --> 00:29:12,536
Uh... I don't know.

460
00:29:12,570 --> 00:29:15,738
I'll have him home as soon as I can.
Maybe, like, 5:00?

461
00:29:15,772 --> 00:29:19,140
Actually, um, we might grab
a bite to eat afterwards.

462
00:29:19,175 --> 00:29:22,440
So, uh... maybe more like 7:00?

463
00:29:22,508 --> 00:29:24,541
All right.

464
00:29:24,575 --> 00:29:25,675
Yeah.

465
00:29:25,709 --> 00:29:27,609
Yeah, I'll drop him off.

466
00:29:31,713 --> 00:29:33,447
Hey.

467
00:29:33,481 --> 00:29:34,782
You know,

468
00:29:34,816 --> 00:29:36,783
hearing your grandfather's
will being read...

469
00:29:36,818 --> 00:29:38,686
I know it's not the
most fun, but...

470
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:40,921
it'll be over soon, I promise.

471
00:29:40,956 --> 00:29:43,690
And it's... it's okay to be sad.

472
00:29:43,724 --> 00:29:46,259
I'm sad for you, dad.

473
00:29:50,029 --> 00:29:51,229
Let's go.

474
00:29:52,864 --> 00:29:55,499
Mr. Shephard.

475
00:29:55,533 --> 00:29:56,666
Hello.

476
00:29:56,701 --> 00:29:59,468
- And you must be David.
- Hi.

477
00:29:59,503 --> 00:30:02,037
We're set up in the
conference room.

478
00:30:02,071 --> 00:30:04,439
I've got a surprise for you.

479
00:30:04,473 --> 00:30:06,440
Do you believe in fate?

480
00:30:11,914 --> 00:30:14,048
This is Claire Littleton.

481
00:30:14,083 --> 00:30:17,318
Claire, this is Mr. Shephard
and his son David.

482
00:30:17,352 --> 00:30:18,652
Hello.

483
00:30:18,686 --> 00:30:21,387
I'm... I'm Jack Shephard.

484
00:30:21,421 --> 00:30:23,622
Hi, it's, uh, it's
really nice to meet you.

485
00:30:23,656 --> 00:30:25,857
You found her.

486
00:30:25,891 --> 00:30:27,591
Actually, she found us.

487
00:30:29,427 --> 00:30:32,795
Uh...

488
00:30:32,830 --> 00:30:35,931
You were in my father's will.

489
00:30:35,965 --> 00:30:38,868
Do you mind if I ask
you how you knew him?

490
00:30:42,338 --> 00:30:44,706
He was my father, too.

491
00:31:04,625 --> 00:31:06,494
I'm sorry. Excuse me.

492
00:31:06,528 --> 00:31:09,563
This is the, uh,
this is the service.

493
00:31:09,631 --> 00:31:12,398
Yeah, this is Dr. Shephard.

494
00:31:12,433 --> 00:31:15,335
No, no, it's not
a very good time.

495
00:31:15,369 --> 00:31:17,738
Yes, they can go
ahead and prep him.

496
00:31:17,772 --> 00:31:20,040
I'm 20 minutes away.

497
00:31:22,711 --> 00:31:25,613
I'm so sorry. There's been
an emergency at the hospital...

498
00:31:25,647 --> 00:31:27,181
and, um...

499
00:31:29,517 --> 00:31:31,418
we're gonna have to reschedule.

500
00:31:49,435 --> 00:31:51,836
I know I'm a little late
to the party, Captain...

501
00:31:51,870 --> 00:31:54,805
but you mind filling us in
on what your game plan is?

502
00:31:54,839 --> 00:31:57,708
My plan, Chesty...
is to land on hydra island,

503
00:31:57,742 --> 00:31:59,743
get ourselves nice and
cuddly with Widmore

504
00:31:59,778 --> 00:32:02,045
until we get a chance
to jump on that sub.

505
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:04,047
Then I'm gonna put a
gun in someone's face

506
00:32:04,081 --> 00:32:06,816
and make 'em take us home.

507
00:32:06,850 --> 00:32:08,784
I like that idea.

508
00:32:08,818 --> 00:32:11,252
I saw some canned food
down in the galley...

509
00:32:11,287 --> 00:32:12,854
anybody else starvin'?

510
00:32:19,359 --> 00:32:22,460
Freckles... take the wheel a minute?

511
00:32:22,495 --> 00:32:23,961
Sure.

512
00:32:26,296 --> 00:32:27,563
Be nice.

513
00:32:27,597 --> 00:32:29,298
Yeah, yeah.

514
00:32:36,004 --> 00:32:38,105
Didn't think you'd show up, doc.

515
00:32:40,407 --> 00:32:41,540
Sorry?

516
00:32:41,575 --> 00:32:43,641
Taking orders ain't
your strong suit.

517
00:32:43,676 --> 00:32:45,542
Nice to see you
finally came around.

518
00:32:49,212 --> 00:32:51,379
This doesn't feel right.

519
00:32:51,413 --> 00:32:53,714
What doesn't feel right?

520
00:32:53,749 --> 00:32:56,117
Leaving the island.

521
00:32:56,151 --> 00:32:58,285
You wanna tell me why not?

522
00:33:06,061 --> 00:33:09,730
Because I remember how I
felt last time I left...

523
00:33:09,764 --> 00:33:12,966
like a part of me was missing.

524
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,202
They got pills for that, doc.

525
00:33:15,237 --> 00:33:16,604
We were brought here

526
00:33:16,639 --> 00:33:19,007
because we're supposed
to do something, James.

527
00:33:19,042 --> 00:33:21,913
And if Locke... that... that thing...

528
00:33:21,947 --> 00:33:24,883
wants us to leave...

529
00:33:24,917 --> 00:33:27,952
maybe it's afraid of what
happens if we stay.

530
00:33:31,556 --> 00:33:33,423
Get off my damn boat.

531
00:33:33,458 --> 00:33:35,492
What?

532
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:37,994
You got a decision to
make and you make it now.

533
00:33:38,062 --> 00:33:39,595
Either you're with us...

534
00:33:39,629 --> 00:33:42,064
you keep that damn
crazy talk to yourself,

535
00:33:42,098 --> 00:33:45,900
- or you're going in the water.
- James, this is a mistake.

536
00:33:45,934 --> 00:33:48,336
And I know there's a part
of you that feels that.

537
00:33:48,370 --> 00:33:50,871
The island is not
done with us yet.

538
00:33:50,905 --> 00:33:52,774
Yeah, well, I'm done
with this island.

539
00:33:52,808 --> 00:33:57,543
So if you wanna take a leap
of faith, Jack... then take it.

540
00:33:57,578 --> 00:34:00,313
Get off my damn boat.

541
00:34:10,990 --> 00:34:14,358
I'm sorry that I
got Juliet killed.

542
00:34:30,473 --> 00:34:32,807
Jack?!

543
00:34:32,842 --> 00:34:34,576
Jack?!

544
00:34:36,812 --> 00:34:39,780
- What did you say to him?
- He changed his mind.

545
00:34:39,814 --> 00:34:42,582
What do you mean,
he changed his mind?!

546
00:34:42,616 --> 00:34:45,317
- What did you say to him?
- He ain't comin' with us.

547
00:34:45,351 --> 00:34:48,786
We have to go back and get him.

548
00:34:48,821 --> 00:34:51,422
We're done going back, Kate.

549
00:36:08,382 --> 00:36:10,315
So all these years, you had no

550
00:36:10,350 --> 00:36:12,017
idea your dad
had another kid?

551
00:36:12,052 --> 00:36:13,985
Nope. None.

552
00:36:14,019 --> 00:36:16,553
Wow. I can't believe he
never even mentioned her.

553
00:36:16,587 --> 00:36:20,090
Yeah, well, your grandfather
kept a lot of things to himself.

554
00:36:20,124 --> 00:36:22,893
Is that where you get it from?

555
00:36:22,927 --> 00:36:24,561
Yeah, probably.

556
00:36:26,096 --> 00:36:27,596
All right. Uh...

557
00:36:27,631 --> 00:36:30,565
- you gonna be okay hangin' while I do this?
- Uh, yeah, sure.

558
00:36:32,099 --> 00:36:34,167
Good luck, dad.

559
00:36:34,201 --> 00:36:36,936
Thanks.

560
00:36:45,046 --> 00:36:46,447
Car V. Ped.

561
00:36:46,481 --> 00:36:48,082
How bad?

562
00:36:48,116 --> 00:36:49,450
Bad.

563
00:36:49,484 --> 00:36:51,119
But here's the kicker...

564
00:36:51,154 --> 00:36:53,088
the victim was already
in a wheelchair.

565
00:36:53,123 --> 00:36:54,690
Pre-existing spinal condition.

566
00:36:54,724 --> 00:36:56,990
Dural sac's obliterated.

567
00:36:57,025 --> 00:37:00,790
That's why we called you.
We're in a bit over our heads here.

568
00:37:00,824 --> 00:37:01,925
Yeah.

569
00:37:02,759 --> 00:37:04,060
I got this.

570
00:37:12,299 --> 00:37:14,700
- We ready to cut?
- Say the word.

571
00:37:14,734 --> 00:37:16,802
Scalpel.

572
00:37:27,510 --> 00:37:29,979
What is it?

573
00:37:30,013 --> 00:37:32,118
I think I know this guy.

574
00:37:49,071 --> 00:37:51,172
Nice day for a swim.

575
00:38:05,419 --> 00:38:08,621
Sawyer took my boat, didn't he?

576
00:38:08,655 --> 00:38:10,322
Yeah.

577
00:38:19,231 --> 00:38:22,066
Everybody stay close.
The camp's over here.

578
00:38:24,134 --> 00:38:26,001
We're not gonna have much time
before Locke figure's out

579
00:38:26,035 --> 00:38:28,070
we made off with his ride.

580
00:38:28,205 --> 00:38:29,339
- Hands up!
- Hey! Whoa!

581
00:38:29,373 --> 00:38:31,941
- Whoa! Take it easy!
- Drop your weapons! Drop 'em!

582
00:38:31,975 --> 00:38:34,811
Drop 'em now!

583
00:38:41,885 --> 00:38:44,019
It's all right. I know him.

584
00:38:44,053 --> 00:38:45,788
Who else is with you?

585
00:38:46,822 --> 00:38:48,591
Nobody! If you're
wondering where Locke is...

586
00:38:48,625 --> 00:38:50,426
he's still back on
the main island.

587
00:38:52,796 --> 00:38:54,729
Turn the fences off.

588
00:38:54,764 --> 00:38:57,431
Ford just showed up on a boat
with five of his friends.

589
00:39:02,336 --> 00:39:04,737
Sun?

590
00:39:04,772 --> 00:39:07,607
Jin?

591
00:39:11,744 --> 00:39:13,878
- Jin!
- Sun!

592
00:39:24,423 --> 00:39:26,859
I love you.

593
00:39:26,894 --> 00:39:28,464
I love you, too.

594
00:39:33,974 --> 00:39:36,608
I never stopped looking for you.

595
00:39:36,642 --> 00:39:40,077
Looks like someone
got their voice back.

596
00:39:40,111 --> 00:39:43,947
We'll never be apart again.

597
00:39:43,981 --> 00:39:46,082
I promise you.

598
00:39:56,925 --> 00:40:00,560
Are you sure?

599
00:40:00,594 --> 00:40:02,495
I-I understand, Charles.

600
00:40:02,529 --> 00:40:03,796
That Widmore?

601
00:40:05,566 --> 00:40:08,166
What the hell are you doin'?

602
00:40:09,636 --> 00:40:11,803
What's it look like I'm doin'?
Hands up now.

603
00:40:14,473 --> 00:40:16,307
On your knees, all of you!

604
00:40:18,610 --> 00:40:20,010
Down!

605
00:40:23,247 --> 00:40:25,281
- We had a deal!
- Deal's off.

606
00:40:29,117 --> 00:40:30,553
We got 'em.

607
00:40:30,587 --> 00:40:32,855
If you've got a sight-line on Locke,
fire when ready.

608
00:40:32,887 --> 00:40:33,955
Roger.

609
00:40:39,126 --> 00:40:41,360
Get down!

610
00:41:06,254 --> 00:41:08,388
Jack... you all right?

611
00:41:10,123 --> 00:41:12,624
Don't worry. It's gonna be okay.

612
00:41:14,092 --> 00:41:16,493
You're with me now.
