1
00:00:04,296 --> 00:00:05,861
Mr. Locke.

2
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:08,965
- Hmm.
- Mr. Locke.

3
00:00:11,349 --> 00:00:13,592
Mr. Locke, 
can you hear me?

4
00:00:17,699 --> 00:00:19,209
Welcome back.

5
00:00:20,123 --> 00:00:21,375
I know you.

6
00:00:22,846 --> 00:00:24,726
We were on the same
flight back from Sydney.

7
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:25,999
I met you in the
baggage claim office.

8
00:00:26,119 --> 00:00:28,320
You had lost your knives.

9
00:00:30,298 --> 00:00:31,669
I'm Jack Shephard.

10
00:00:34,244 --> 00:00:35,937
What happened?

11
00:00:36,588 --> 00:00:39,993
You were run down by a car.
You just came out of surgery.

12
00:00:41,844 --> 00:00:43,727
Am I...

13
00:00:45,242 --> 00:00:46,453
Am I all right?

14
00:00:46,573 --> 00:00:48,112
Your dural sac ruptured.

15
00:00:48,754 --> 00:00:51,416
But I think I got everything
back were it belongs.

16
00:00:55,072 --> 00:00:56,790
Mr. Locke, while I was
operating, I got a look

17
00:00:56,824 --> 00:00:59,826
At the initial injury to your spine...
the one that put you in the wheelchair.

18
00:00:59,946 --> 00:01:02,903
And I was hoping you could
tell me how that happened.

19
00:01:03,916 --> 00:01:05,216
Why?

20
00:01:06,042 --> 00:01:07,864
Because I think
you're a candidate.

21
00:01:11,122 --> 00:01:13,055
A candidate for what?

22
00:01:13,452 --> 00:01:14,803
A new procedure.

23
00:01:14,923 --> 00:01:17,607
A surgery we're
developing, and...

24
00:01:18,221 --> 00:01:20,330
if it works, it could restore
feelings to your legs.

25
00:01:20,367 --> 00:01:23,303
In fact, you may
even walk again.

26
00:01:23,623 --> 00:01:25,048
If you'll give me
a shot, Mr. Locke,

27
00:01:25,089 --> 00:01:28,522
I think that...
that I could fix you.

28
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:34,207
No, thank you.

29
00:01:36,828 --> 00:01:39,606
Well, now there's minimal risk,
and... and the benefit could...

30
00:01:39,726 --> 00:01:41,236
I said no, doctor.

31
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:44,872
John?

32
00:01:44,992 --> 00:01:46,770
- Oh.
- Oh, John.

33
00:01:47,717 --> 00:01:49,359
It's the first time they let
me see you.

34
00:01:49,377 --> 00:01:51,359
Oh!

35
00:01:51,678 --> 00:01:54,055
- Are... are you okay?
- I'm fine.

36
00:01:55,485 --> 00:01:58,595
- Are you his doctor?
- Yes, I am. Dr. Shephard.

37
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:01,008
Oh, thank you.

38
00:02:01,128 --> 00:02:03,750
Thank you.
Thank you for saving him.

39
00:02:03,870 --> 00:02:06,048
Thank you.

40
00:02:22,609 --> 00:02:24,417
Welcome to Hydra Island.

41
00:02:29,469 --> 00:02:31,979
At least you didn't
have to paddle.

42
00:02:51,241 --> 00:02:52,752
Get in.

43
00:02:52,872 --> 00:02:53,725
Uh-uh.

44
00:02:53,845 --> 00:02:56,049
Ain't no way I'm gettin'
back in those cages.

45
00:02:56,169 --> 00:03:00,120
- Well, I've got the gun, so you...
- Not anymore, Dough-boy.

46
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:02,064
Drop the gun!

47
00:03:02,484 --> 00:03:04,838
Put the gun down
or I'll kill her!

48
00:03:05,692 --> 00:03:06,983
You ain't gonna kill anybody.

49
00:03:07,039 --> 00:03:08,794
Otherwise, you wouldn't
be throwing us in a cage.

50
00:03:08,914 --> 00:03:11,933
I have a list of names.
Ford, you're on it,

51
00:03:12,053 --> 00:03:14,124
as are Reyes and the Kwons.

52
00:03:15,018 --> 00:03:17,283
Kate Austen? She's not.

53
00:03:17,403 --> 00:03:19,910
It doesn't matter to me
whether she lives or dies.

54
00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:21,576
Don't listen to him.

55
00:03:40,984 --> 00:03:42,624
You may not believe it,

56
00:03:42,744 --> 00:03:44,693
but I'm doing this
for your own good.

57
00:03:45,130 --> 00:03:47,971
<i>You're right...
I don't believe it.</i>

58
00:03:50,037 --> 00:03:52,262
- Is the fence live yet?
- They're saying about an hour.

59
00:03:52,382 --> 00:03:55,262
We haven't got an hour.
Tell them to work faster.

60
00:03:56,613 --> 00:03:58,208
He's coming.

61
00:04:10,293 --> 00:04:13,777
Season 6 Episode 14
  "The Candidate"

62
00:04:26,482 --> 00:04:28,083
Hello?

63
00:04:29,625 --> 00:04:30,875
Excuse me?

64
00:04:30,995 --> 00:04:32,088
- Hello?
- Hmm?

65
00:04:32,208 --> 00:04:33,519
Oh!

66
00:04:33,639 --> 00:04:35,715
I'm sorry. There was
no one out front...

67
00:04:35,835 --> 00:04:37,246
and I heard the drill.

68
00:04:37,366 --> 00:04:39,260
Do you know where
I can find Dr. Nadler?

69
00:04:39,366 --> 00:04:41,260
Well, you can
find him right here.

70
00:04:41,264 --> 00:04:44,711
And if you're not a patient,
you can call me Bernard.

71
00:04:44,831 --> 00:04:46,598
Hi.

72
00:04:46,718 --> 00:04:48,004
Jack Shephard.

73
00:04:48,825 --> 00:04:52,103
Um, I'm a surgeon
over at St. Sebastian,

74
00:04:52,223 --> 00:04:55,520
and I was hoping to get a look
at one of your patient files.

75
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:56,923
And which patient would that be?

76
00:04:57,043 --> 00:04:59,673
His name's John Locke,
and our records said

77
00:04:59,793 --> 00:05:04,126
that you had done some emergency oral
surgery on him about three years back.

78
00:05:04,435 --> 00:05:07,523
- And what are you looking for, exactly?
- I wanna know how he was hurt.

79
00:05:08,448 --> 00:05:11,986
Do you mind if I ask you why you're
so interested in Mr. Locke, Jack?

80
00:05:13,585 --> 00:05:14,836
Um...

81
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:18,532
He and I met about a week ago.

82
00:05:18,652 --> 00:05:20,557
We were on the same flight back
from Australia.

83
00:05:20,677 --> 00:05:22,703
Oceanic 815.

84
00:05:25,981 --> 00:05:27,994
I sat across the aisle from you.

85
00:05:29,725 --> 00:05:30,852
If memory serves,

86
00:05:30,917 --> 00:05:33,757
you were flirting with my wife Rose
when I was in the bathroom.

87
00:05:35,456 --> 00:05:37,304
It's pretty weird, huh?

88
00:05:37,424 --> 00:05:38,893
Yeah.

89
00:05:41,295 --> 00:05:45,324
Well, then... maybe you're on
to something here, hmm?

90
00:05:47,395 --> 00:05:50,232
Now I can't break
patient confidentiality

91
00:05:50,352 --> 00:05:51,722
and tell you something
I shouldn't,

92
00:05:51,842 --> 00:05:54,631
<i>but I can tell you that when
I treated Mr. Locke...</i>

93
00:05:55,068 --> 00:05:57,969
there was another man in
the same accident with him.

94
00:05:58,089 --> 00:06:00,206
Wait, that was... three years ago.
You just...

95
00:06:00,326 --> 00:06:01,748
remember that?

96
00:06:02,071 --> 00:06:03,989
Of course I do, Jack.

97
00:06:08,111 --> 00:06:09,636
Anthony Cooper.

98
00:06:10,097 --> 00:06:11,645
Good luck, doc.

99
00:06:12,832 --> 00:06:15,239
I hope you find what
you're looking for.

100
00:06:22,735 --> 00:06:24,331
What happened?

101
00:06:26,569 --> 00:06:28,397
There was a mortar attack.

102
00:06:28,517 --> 00:06:30,423
Widmore's people fired on us.

103
00:06:31,993 --> 00:06:33,376
Locke saved you.

104
00:06:38,653 --> 00:06:41,057
What about the rest of your group...
what happened to them?

105
00:06:41,177 --> 00:06:43,878
The ones who weren't killed,
scattered into the jungle.

106
00:06:44,963 --> 00:06:46,672
It's just the three of us now.

107
00:06:47,308 --> 00:06:48,917
Why did he bring me here?

108
00:06:49,037 --> 00:06:51,322
Because your friends got
themselves captured.

109
00:06:52,097 --> 00:06:53,460
And now...

110
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:55,849
we're gonna have to rescue them.

111
00:06:56,405 --> 00:06:58,014
Rescue them from what?

112
00:06:58,134 --> 00:07:00,837
Widmore has them in a cage
about a half a mile inland.

113
00:07:00,957 --> 00:07:03,122
- Why would he...
- You know, I would ask him,

114
00:07:03,242 --> 00:07:06,476
except I don't think he's gonna
give me a straight answer.

115
00:07:06,596 --> 00:07:10,122
But I can't imagine that
his intentions are good.

116
00:07:10,599 --> 00:07:12,228
If we move right now...

117
00:07:12,348 --> 00:07:14,737
we can break your people out,
run for the plane -

118
00:07:14,857 --> 00:07:18,472
and be off this island before
Widmore knows what hit him.

119
00:07:20,068 --> 00:07:21,836
They're not my people...

120
00:07:22,948 --> 00:07:24,933
and I'm not leaving the island.

121
00:07:26,731 --> 00:07:29,333
Well, Jack, I'm hoping you'll still
change your mind about that.

122
00:07:30,085 --> 00:07:32,647
<i>But your friends do
want to leave...</i>

123
00:07:32,985 --> 00:07:36,681
and since they just ran
away from me on my own boat,

124
00:07:37,746 --> 00:07:40,666
I'm gonna need your help convincing
them that they can trust me.

125
00:07:41,799 --> 00:07:43,893
<i>Why should I trust you?</i>

126
00:07:46,189 --> 00:07:50,599
Because I could kill you,
Jack... right here, right now.

127
00:07:50,897 --> 00:07:52,924
And I could kill every
single one of your friends...

128
00:07:53,044 --> 00:07:55,867
and there's not a thing that
you could do to stop me.

129
00:07:56,821 --> 00:07:58,573
But instead of killing you...

130
00:07:58,621 --> 00:08:01,173
I saved your life and
now, I wanna save them, too.

131
00:08:04,568 --> 00:08:06,237
So will you help me?

132
00:08:23,849 --> 00:08:25,749
You feel like we're
runnin' in circles?

133
00:08:26,531 --> 00:08:28,209
Back in these cages...

134
00:08:31,077 --> 00:08:33,211
<i>except last time,
the gun was to my head.</i>

135
00:08:34,324 --> 00:08:36,100
He wouldn't have
killed me, James.

136
00:08:40,396 --> 00:08:42,508
That cave I told you about,

137
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:44,568
where all the names are written?

138
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:47,501
Your name was there, too.

139
00:08:49,103 --> 00:08:50,713
But it was crossed out.

140
00:08:52,386 --> 00:08:54,788
He doesn't need you, Kate.

141
00:09:03,373 --> 00:09:04,942
So she's with your mother?

142
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:08,479
Yes. You saw her pictures... how?

143
00:09:09,075 --> 00:09:11,621
Widmore's people found
your camera on the plane.

144
00:09:12,137 --> 00:09:14,204
He showed me the pictures.

145
00:09:15,217 --> 00:09:16,787
Our daughter...

146
00:09:17,422 --> 00:09:19,237
she's so beautiful.

147
00:09:24,508 --> 00:09:26,421
I have your ring.

148
00:09:50,550 --> 00:09:51,444
Uh-oh.

149
00:09:51,564 --> 00:09:53,769
What happened?

150
00:09:56,448 --> 00:09:58,627
Somebody shut us down?
What's going on?

151
00:10:00,098 --> 00:10:03,137
Somebody killed the power.
Get a team to that generator now!

152
00:10:12,267 --> 00:10:14,539
And we're dead.

153
00:10:24,123 --> 00:10:26,759
Go! Go! Go!

154
00:10:29,603 --> 00:10:30,764
Aah!

155
00:10:42,404 --> 00:10:42,912
Hey.

156
00:10:42,977 --> 00:10:45,181
I think I can reach the keys.

157
00:10:48,172 --> 00:10:49,999
Hurry. When that thing's done
with them, he's coming for us.

158
00:10:50,119 --> 00:10:51,926
Well, I ain't waitin'.

159
00:10:53,082 --> 00:10:55,228
Uhh! Damn it!

160
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:08,628
What are you doing here?

161
00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:14,161
I'm with him. Come on.

162
00:11:27,359 --> 00:11:28,671
How much further to the plane?

163
00:11:28,791 --> 00:11:30,757
I'd say about a quarter-mile,
just over that ridge.

164
00:11:31,055 --> 00:11:32,776
So you're coming with us now?

165
00:11:33,435 --> 00:11:35,938
I'm gonna take you to the plane,
but I'm not getting on it.

166
00:11:37,289 --> 00:11:39,168
I'm sorry, Kate. I'm...

167
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:41,886
I'm not meant to go.

168
00:11:44,604 --> 00:11:47,584
Thanks for coming back for us, doc.
Appreciate it.

169
00:11:53,432 --> 00:11:55,200
No, it's okay.

170
00:11:56,512 --> 00:11:59,115
Sayid's with us. He was the one
who turned off the generators.

171
00:11:59,780 --> 00:12:01,608
Great. The more the merrier.

172
00:12:01,728 --> 00:12:03,351
We need to go. Locke's waiting.

173
00:12:10,208 --> 00:12:13,171
Are you a relative
of Mr. Cooper's?

174
00:12:14,482 --> 00:12:16,145
Uh, no. No, I'm not, but...

175
00:12:16,265 --> 00:12:17,555
M-may I ask the
nature of the visit?

176
00:12:17,675 --> 00:12:19,602
Um... Dr. Shephard?

177
00:12:20,555 --> 00:12:21,834
Hey.

178
00:12:21,954 --> 00:12:23,344
What are you doing here?

179
00:12:23,464 --> 00:12:26,602
Um, I'm here to see
Anthony Cooper.

180
00:12:26,722 --> 00:12:28,548
Do you know him?
Is that why you're here, too?

181
00:12:29,542 --> 00:12:31,131
What do you want with Anthony?

182
00:12:31,667 --> 00:12:33,318
I wanna talk to him about the

183
00:12:33,367 --> 00:12:35,318
accident that he
was in with Mr. Locke.

184
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:38,231
Um, Dr. Shephard...

185
00:12:38,583 --> 00:12:39,894
just go.

186
00:12:40,014 --> 00:12:42,388
Look, all I wanna
do is help him.

187
00:12:42,508 --> 00:12:45,686
I know. John told me
about the operation.

188
00:12:45,806 --> 00:12:47,043
He doesn't want it.

189
00:12:47,163 --> 00:12:48,434
Why doesn't he want it?

190
00:12:48,554 --> 00:12:51,295
Please, Dr. Shephard,
just leave this alone.

191
00:12:52,428 --> 00:12:54,156
You saved John's life.

192
00:12:54,276 --> 00:12:56,111
Why can't that be enough?

193
00:12:57,931 --> 00:12:59,665
Because it's not.

194
00:13:05,381 --> 00:13:07,586
<i>Housekeeping, dial 23.</i>

195
00:13:07,706 --> 00:13:10,387
<i>Housekeeping, extension 23.</i>

196
00:13:17,806 --> 00:13:19,459
Hi.

197
00:13:44,009 --> 00:13:46,304
This is Anthony Cooper.

198
00:13:50,346 --> 00:13:52,372
He's John's father.

199
00:14:01,730 --> 00:14:03,002
Hey! Stop!

200
00:14:04,433 --> 00:14:06,002
Stop right there!

201
00:15:26,605 --> 00:15:28,126
Well, all righty.

202
00:15:28,246 --> 00:15:30,578
Let's see what it'll take
to get this baby to fly.

203
00:15:39,187 --> 00:15:41,388
Son of a bitch.

204
00:15:45,209 --> 00:15:46,341
His neck's been broken.

205
00:15:46,461 --> 00:15:47,941
That's because I broke it.

206
00:15:57,236 --> 00:15:58,766
If it's any consolation...

207
00:15:58,886 --> 00:16:00,574
Widmore knew that I
would kill these men.

208
00:16:00,694 --> 00:16:01,638
What are you talking about?

209
00:16:01,758 --> 00:16:03,525
They were only guarding
the plane for show.

210
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:06,773
If Charles had really wanted to
keep me from actually getting on-board,

211
00:16:06,893 --> 00:16:09,467
he wouldn't have... moved
his little fences.

212
00:16:09,587 --> 00:16:12,020
<i>Well, wait. Now he wants us
to leave the island?</i>

213
00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:15,477
No, Hugo. He wants to get us all
in the same place at the same time...

214
00:16:15,597 --> 00:16:18,391
A nice, confined space we have
no hope of getting out of.

215
00:16:19,524 --> 00:16:21,773
And then he wants to kill us.

216
00:16:22,326 --> 00:16:25,366
- Kill us with what?
- With this...

217
00:16:28,775 --> 00:16:30,741
four bricks of C4.

218
00:16:32,490 --> 00:16:34,062
I found 'em in one of the
overhead compartments,

219
00:16:34,109 --> 00:16:36,087
wired to the electrical
system of the plane.

220
00:16:36,882 --> 00:16:38,654
If we would've turned it on...

221
00:16:40,711 --> 00:16:41,817
boom.

222
00:16:44,376 --> 00:16:45,329
So what now?

223
00:16:45,449 --> 00:16:48,469
We can't be sure he didn't put more
explosives on the plane. It's not safe.

224
00:16:49,432 --> 00:16:51,081
If we're gonna leave the island,

225
00:16:51,538 --> 00:16:53,830
I think we have to
take the submarine.

226
00:16:55,004 --> 00:16:57,190
Well, that's what I've been
sayin' all along.

227
00:16:57,310 --> 00:16:58,680
Dude, wait.

228
00:16:59,355 --> 00:17:01,064
He's not supposed
to leave the island.

229
00:17:01,402 --> 00:17:04,718
- I mean, Alpert said...
- Screw Alpert. He ain't here.

230
00:17:06,497 --> 00:17:08,645
That's twice you've
saved our asses.

231
00:17:09,738 --> 00:17:11,287
Guess I was wrong about you.

232
00:17:11,407 --> 00:17:12,797
Thank you, James.

233
00:17:14,552 --> 00:17:16,698
That submarine is
gonna be heavily defended.

234
00:17:16,818 --> 00:17:18,909
We're gonna need everyone.

235
00:17:20,711 --> 00:17:24,199
I'll help you, but like I said...
I'm not going with you.

236
00:17:25,053 --> 00:17:26,941
Fair enough.

237
00:17:27,709 --> 00:17:29,054
Let's go.

238
00:17:36,073 --> 00:17:37,126
Hey.

239
00:17:37,246 --> 00:17:40,007
- I-I'm sorry that I...
- That's all right, Claire.

240
00:17:40,543 --> 00:17:42,663
I understand why
you went with them.

241
00:17:45,797 --> 00:17:47,582
Hey, doc... listen up.

242
00:17:48,022 --> 00:17:50,649
You don't wanna leave this island,
that's your own damn business.

243
00:17:50,769 --> 00:17:52,653
But I'm gonna ask you
for one last favor.

244
00:17:53,468 --> 00:17:55,255
I don't trust that
thing one bit.

245
00:17:55,375 --> 00:17:56,825
So here's what I need you to do.

246
00:17:56,945 --> 00:17:58,443
Once we get to the dock...

247
00:17:58,563 --> 00:18:00,598
you make sure it
doesn't get on the sub.

248
00:18:01,587 --> 00:18:04,231
How am I supposed to do that?
You saw what it did back there.

249
00:18:04,911 --> 00:18:07,156
Just get it in the water...
I'll take care of the rest.

250
00:18:13,869 --> 00:18:15,152
Mm.

251
00:18:15,272 --> 00:18:18,488
<i>C.T. test to trauma 3.
C.T. test to trauma 3.</i>

252
00:18:18,608 --> 00:18:20,403
Mr. Locke, are you awake?

253
00:18:22,410 --> 00:18:24,177
Push the button.

254
00:18:26,388 --> 00:18:27,839
Mr. Locke... can you hear me?

255
00:18:27,959 --> 00:18:30,376
I wish you had believed me.

256
00:18:33,420 --> 00:18:35,089
Excuse me?

257
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:40,112
Ms. Littleton?

258
00:18:40,867 --> 00:18:42,973
Dr. Shephard. I-I was
just looking for you.

259
00:18:43,093 --> 00:18:45,377
The, um, the lawyer
told me you work here.

260
00:18:46,674 --> 00:18:48,859
Um, c-can we talk?

261
00:18:48,979 --> 00:18:50,458
Yes. Yes.

262
00:18:57,698 --> 00:18:59,698
Oh. No. I'm okay.

263
00:19:00,599 --> 00:19:01,602
Sorry I had to run out

264
00:19:01,722 --> 00:19:03,052
Of the--the will
reading the other day,

265
00:19:03,172 --> 00:19:05,694
- but I did have an emergency and...
- Oh. N-no worries.

266
00:19:08,253 --> 00:19:12,743
Um, I know this is as awkward for
you as it is for me.

267
00:19:12,863 --> 00:19:14,825
I never even met this man.

268
00:19:16,257 --> 00:19:18,208
Anyway, the, uh...
the lawyer gave me this.

269
00:19:18,328 --> 00:19:20,904
She said, uh... there'd
be more stuff to come,

270
00:19:21,024 --> 00:19:24,770
but that my father especially
wanted me to have this.

271
00:19:25,147 --> 00:19:28,346
You know why or what
it's supposed to mean?

272
00:19:29,204 --> 00:19:30,754
I have no idea.

273
00:19:30,874 --> 00:19:32,304
But then...

274
00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:34,741
I-I didn't know about you, either.

275
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:39,692
Our father, uh...

276
00:19:40,129 --> 00:19:42,791
you mind... you mind
if I ask how he died?

277
00:19:45,029 --> 00:19:48,168
He was found in an alley
outside a bar in Sydney.

278
00:19:49,002 --> 00:19:51,032
He drank himself to death.

279
00:19:52,004 --> 00:19:53,951
I flew down to bring
his body back,

280
00:19:54,071 --> 00:19:58,032
but then, uh...
the airline lost it.

281
00:19:58,588 --> 00:20:00,694
I just flew in from
Sydney a few days ago.

282
00:20:01,483 --> 00:20:02,437
When?

283
00:20:02,557 --> 00:20:04,046
Uh, last Wednesday.

284
00:20:05,278 --> 00:20:07,284
Oceanic flight 815?

285
00:20:07,652 --> 00:20:09,841
Uh... yeah.

286
00:20:15,127 --> 00:20:16,398
Do you mind if I
have a look at that?

287
00:20:16,518 --> 00:20:19,200
Um, sure. Go ahead.

288
00:20:31,487 --> 00:20:34,765
I'm sorry. I-I wish I knew why
he wanted you to have this.

289
00:20:37,189 --> 00:20:38,676
Yeah. Me, too.

290
00:20:40,968 --> 00:20:44,292
Well, um, it was nice
seeing you again.

291
00:20:46,705 --> 00:20:48,394
Thanks for trying to help.

292
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:51,692
Where are you staying?

293
00:20:51,812 --> 00:20:54,007
Uh, just down
the road... a motel.

294
00:20:54,563 --> 00:20:56,505
Why don't you come stay with me?

295
00:20:58,055 --> 00:20:59,445
Stay with you?

296
00:21:00,929 --> 00:21:02,956
I mean, we're...
we're strangers.

297
00:21:03,076 --> 00:21:05,578
No, we're not
strangers. We're...

298
00:21:06,055 --> 00:21:07,760
we're family.

299
00:21:31,565 --> 00:21:33,174
Just 'cause there ain't
any goons on the dock,

300
00:21:33,294 --> 00:21:34,942
doesn't mean they
ain't on the sub.

301
00:21:35,379 --> 00:21:36,790
We're going in hard. Got it?

302
00:21:36,910 --> 00:21:39,153
Lapidus, Hugo, Jin,
Sun... you're with me.

303
00:21:39,273 --> 00:21:41,915
The rest of you wait 30 seconds,
head down the dock behind us.

304
00:21:43,981 --> 00:21:45,729
You think you two
can get our backs?

305
00:21:49,452 --> 00:21:50,902
Absolutely.

306
00:21:53,744 --> 00:21:55,611
All right.

307
00:21:55,731 --> 00:21:57,409
Let's go home.

308
00:22:34,808 --> 00:22:37,291
<i>After engine room,</i>
<i>power the bilges.</i>

309
00:22:37,759 --> 00:22:39,945
<i>After engine room,
power the bilges, please.</i>

310
00:22:51,439 --> 00:22:53,251
Where's the damn Captain?

311
00:22:58,631 --> 00:23:00,339
Put your damn hands up.

312
00:23:00,459 --> 00:23:03,240
Nothin' personal.

313
00:23:03,856 --> 00:23:06,522
Okay, Hoss. How about you get
ready to fire this thing up?

314
00:23:06,838 --> 00:23:08,179
I got it.

315
00:23:11,969 --> 00:23:13,240
Let's go.

316
00:23:32,744 --> 00:23:35,327
You sure you won't
reconsider, Jack?

317
00:23:35,823 --> 00:23:37,035
Yeah, I'm sure.

318
00:23:37,155 --> 00:23:38,622
Whoever told you
you needed to stay,

319
00:23:38,742 --> 00:23:40,993
had no idea what they
were talking about.

320
00:23:42,715 --> 00:23:44,594
John Locke told me
I needed to stay.

321
00:23:48,458 --> 00:23:50,330
What happened?

322
00:23:50,864 --> 00:23:52,569
Kate?!

323
00:24:03,669 --> 00:24:05,736
Aah!

324
00:24:08,246 --> 00:24:10,471
Claire! <i>Let's go now!</i>

325
00:24:41,439 --> 00:24:43,283
What's going on up there?

326
00:24:43,403 --> 00:24:44,723
What happened?

327
00:24:44,843 --> 00:24:46,361
Widmore's people shot her.

328
00:24:51,135 --> 00:24:53,162
Hurley, I need a first aid kit.

329
00:24:53,282 --> 00:24:55,466
- Who else is up there?
- Claire.

330
00:25:02,061 --> 00:25:03,274
Claire!

331
00:25:03,394 --> 00:25:04,842
<i>James!</i>

332
00:25:17,426 --> 00:25:19,313
Lapidus... if you can hear me,

333
00:25:19,433 --> 00:25:21,360
- dive, dive!
- Let's go!

334
00:25:29,988 --> 00:25:32,372
- Hey! Wait, wait!
- Claire, wait!

335
00:25:32,492 --> 00:25:34,631
<i>- Wait!</i>
- Claire!

336
00:25:34,969 --> 00:25:36,260
What the hell are you doing?

337
00:25:36,380 --> 00:25:38,931
What we came
here to do... leaving.

338
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:42,842
- It's all right. It's all right.
- No!

339
00:25:42,962 --> 00:25:43,993
They're leaving us!

340
00:25:44,113 --> 00:25:47,371
No, trust me. You don't
want to be on that sub.

341
00:26:02,161 --> 00:26:05,276
- Claire?
- Kate.

342
00:26:05,396 --> 00:26:08,516
- Claire? Where's Claire?
- She's still up there.

343
00:26:08,636 --> 00:26:09,522
No, we can't leave
without her. We can't...

344
00:26:09,536 --> 00:26:10,722
Kate. Kate.

345
00:26:11,142 --> 00:26:12,376
Is she gonna be okay?

346
00:26:12,382 --> 00:26:13,976
Jack, I can't find
the first aid kit, dude.

347
00:26:14,822 --> 00:26:16,551
Jin... my pack.

348
00:26:16,671 --> 00:26:18,577
There might be a shirt in
there I can use for pressure.

349
00:26:18,697 --> 00:26:22,260
It's okay. Just relax.
Everything's gonna be all right.

350
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:24,138
Here. Can you help her?

351
00:26:24,258 --> 00:26:26,741
I think the bullet went
straight through...

352
00:26:27,675 --> 00:26:29,264
What?

353
00:26:45,846 --> 00:26:48,210
Dude, where'd that come from?

354
00:26:48,508 --> 00:26:50,185
Locke.

355
00:26:52,175 --> 00:26:54,500
We did exactly what he wanted.

356
00:27:01,481 --> 00:27:04,680
- We have to get to the surface.
- What the hell?

357
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:06,639
<i>We have to get
to the surface now!</i>

358
00:27:08,017 --> 00:27:09,591
Lapidus, take us up.

359
00:27:10,711 --> 00:27:12,861
- We're divin'!
- Just do it!

360
00:27:15,915 --> 00:27:17,624
You heard him. Up!

361
00:27:22,159 --> 00:27:25,040
- Dude, how'd that get on the sub?
- Locke put it in my pack.

362
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:27,027
Why would he do that?
He wanted to come with us.

363
00:27:27,147 --> 00:27:28,944
You're damn right he did.
That's why I shut his ass out.

364
00:27:29,064 --> 00:27:32,473
<i>He wanted you to shut him out.
Any idea how that thing works?</i>

365
00:27:32,593 --> 00:27:35,314
- Can we turn it off?
- This watch is jury-rigged to the battery.

366
00:27:35,434 --> 00:27:39,422
- The battery detonates the explosives.
- How much time till we're up, Frank?

367
00:27:40,297 --> 00:27:42,007
At least five minutes.

368
00:27:42,304 --> 00:27:44,926
We ain't got five minutes.
What's it gonna be, Sayid?

369
00:27:45,046 --> 00:27:46,598
These wires... they're
leads from the watch.

370
00:27:46,718 --> 00:27:48,126
If we disconnect them
from the battery,

371
00:27:48,183 --> 00:27:50,073
technically speaking,
the bomb should be inert.

372
00:27:50,083 --> 00:27:51,173
"Technically"?

373
00:27:51,183 --> 00:27:52,762
Yes, but you need to pull
them out simultaneously,

374
00:27:52,882 --> 00:27:54,655
- and I'm not sure...
- Step aside.

375
00:27:54,980 --> 00:27:57,390
- No, wait. Wait.
- What the hell are you doing, doc?

376
00:27:58,293 --> 00:27:59,882
Nothing's gonna happen.

377
00:28:00,518 --> 00:28:02,325
- What?
- Don't pull those wires out...

378
00:28:02,445 --> 00:28:04,127
we're okay.
Nothing's gonna happen.

379
00:28:04,247 --> 00:28:06,020
If I don't pull these wires,
Locke's gonna blow us

380
00:28:06,073 --> 00:28:08,705
- to kingdom come.
- No, he's not!

381
00:28:08,773 --> 00:28:10,205
Locke can't kill us.

382
00:28:10,694 --> 00:28:12,329
Uh... what?

383
00:28:12,449 --> 00:28:14,764
This is what he wanted.
This is what he's been waiting for.

384
00:28:14,785 --> 00:28:17,511
Everything that he has done
has been to get us here.

385
00:28:17,631 --> 00:28:19,189
He wanted to get us
all in the same place

386
00:28:19,233 --> 00:28:21,296
at the same time...
a nice enclosed space

387
00:28:21,416 --> 00:28:24,138
- where we had no hopes of getting out of.
- I don't understand.

388
00:28:24,258 --> 00:28:26,622
Locke said that he can't
leave the island without us.

389
00:28:27,476 --> 00:28:30,415
I think that he can't leave the island
unless we're all dead.

390
00:28:31,049 --> 00:28:32,817
He told me that he could
kill any one of us

391
00:28:32,937 --> 00:28:35,738
whenever he wanted. So what
if he hasn't because he's...

392
00:28:36,036 --> 00:28:37,716
he's not allowed to?

393
00:28:39,231 --> 00:28:41,814
What if he's trying to get
us to kill each other?

394
00:28:42,609 --> 00:28:44,131
Stay out of my way, doc.

395
00:28:44,251 --> 00:28:45,433
Now if he wanted that
thing to blow up...

396
00:28:45,499 --> 00:28:47,506
why would he put a timer in it? Why not
just throw it inside?

397
00:28:47,626 --> 00:28:49,405
- I don't care.
- Nothing is gonna happen.

398
00:28:49,424 --> 00:28:50,492
It's not your decision to make.

399
00:28:50,518 --> 00:28:52,918
- He can't kill us!
- I'm not gonna stand here and do nothing!

400
00:28:52,956 --> 00:28:54,078
James...

401
00:28:56,690 --> 00:28:58,862
we are going to be okay.

402
00:28:59,949 --> 00:29:01,799
You just have to trust me.

403
00:29:06,109 --> 00:29:08,036
Sorry, doc... I don't.

404
00:29:29,028 --> 00:29:31,373
Listen carefully.
There's a well on the main island

405
00:29:31,493 --> 00:29:33,439
A half mile South from
the camp we just left.

406
00:29:33,559 --> 00:29:36,224
Desmond's inside it.
Locke wants him dead,

407
00:29:36,562 --> 00:29:38,608
which means you're going to need him.
Do you understand me?

408
00:29:38,728 --> 00:29:40,198
Why are you telling me this?

409
00:29:41,013 --> 00:29:42,821
Because it's going
to be you, Jack.

410
00:29:44,339 --> 00:29:46,012
Sayid!

411
00:30:17,337 --> 00:30:19,503
Oh, hell.

412
00:30:19,821 --> 00:30:21,243
Uhh!

413
00:30:40,183 --> 00:30:42,795
- Are you okay?
- What happened? Did Sayid just...

414
00:30:42,915 --> 00:30:44,315
Help!

415
00:30:44,435 --> 00:30:46,644
- Sun!
- Help!

416
00:30:46,950 --> 00:30:48,236
Wait!

417
00:30:51,666 --> 00:30:53,454
- Hold on. I'll get you out.
- Jin!

418
00:30:53,574 --> 00:30:55,282
No!

419
00:30:55,402 --> 00:30:58,024
- Sawyer! I need help!
- Jin!

420
00:30:59,116 --> 00:31:00,478
Hurley!

421
00:31:01,481 --> 00:31:02,613
Hurley!

422
00:31:02,733 --> 00:31:04,183
You gotta take Kate outta here.

423
00:31:04,303 --> 00:31:07,149
- What about everybody else?
- I'll take care of them!

424
00:31:09,461 --> 00:31:11,001
I have to go after Sayid!

425
00:31:11,121 --> 00:31:12,690
There is no Sayid!

426
00:31:14,547 --> 00:31:16,375
Listen to me. Take this tank

427
00:31:16,495 --> 00:31:19,235
And buddy-breathe and swim out
where the blast hole is, okay?

428
00:31:19,355 --> 00:31:22,359
Hurley, you can
do this... okay?

429
00:31:23,631 --> 00:31:24,823
Okay.

430
00:31:24,943 --> 00:31:25,995
Go.

431
00:31:31,037 --> 00:31:32,405
Doc!

432
00:31:48,166 --> 00:31:51,484
Push. On three.

433
00:31:51,604 --> 00:31:54,067
One... two... three.

434
00:32:05,577 --> 00:32:07,078
Sawyer!

435
00:32:07,198 --> 00:32:08,805
Jack!

436
00:32:11,340 --> 00:32:12,612
Sawyer!

437
00:32:12,732 --> 00:32:14,454
Sawyer!

438
00:32:14,837 --> 00:32:16,981
Sawyer.

439
00:32:22,478 --> 00:32:23,968
Jin...

440
00:32:24,088 --> 00:32:25,222
go.

441
00:32:25,342 --> 00:32:27,288
- No.
- Save yourself.

442
00:32:27,408 --> 00:32:28,675
I'm going to get
you out of here.

443
00:32:32,373 --> 00:32:34,836
Go. Go. I'll get her free.

444
00:32:34,956 --> 00:32:36,545
No. We can do this!

445
00:32:36,665 --> 00:32:38,373
Just go!
Save Sawyer.

446
00:32:47,386 --> 00:32:48,836
Jin!

447
00:32:49,750 --> 00:32:51,776
Take this. I can get
him out without it.

448
00:32:51,896 --> 00:32:53,718
No. You can't, Jack.

449
00:32:59,933 --> 00:33:01,502
Just go.

450
00:33:01,622 --> 00:33:02,993
Go.

451
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:03,411
Jin.

452
00:34:05,398 --> 00:34:06,948
You have to go.

453
00:34:07,068 --> 00:34:09,176
No, I can do this.

454
00:34:09,296 --> 00:34:11,302
No. No, you can't.

455
00:34:12,017 --> 00:34:14,064
Please go.

456
00:34:14,739 --> 00:34:16,428
I won't leave you.

457
00:34:34,419 --> 00:34:36,485
I'm gonna get you out of here.

458
00:34:36,843 --> 00:34:38,338
Go.

459
00:34:42,247 --> 00:34:44,651
Go. Please.

460
00:34:44,771 --> 00:34:46,102
Go!

461
00:35:03,176 --> 00:35:04,705
I love you, Sun.

462
00:35:06,275 --> 00:35:08,401
I love you.

463
00:36:13,060 --> 00:36:14,638
Is somebody meeting
you, Mr. Locke?

464
00:36:14,758 --> 00:36:17,123
Yes. My fianc?e, Helen.

465
00:36:17,579 --> 00:36:18,963
She's, uh...

466
00:36:20,547 --> 00:36:22,236
Probably stuck in traffic.

467
00:36:22,832 --> 00:36:24,282
Hey, I'll take it from here.

468
00:36:24,402 --> 00:36:25,653
You know,
I'm pretty good at this.

469
00:36:25,773 --> 00:36:29,011
- Well, best of luck to you, sir.
- Thank you. See ya.

470
00:36:29,457 --> 00:36:30,788
Mr. Locke.

471
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:33,411
I'm glad I caught ya.

472
00:36:33,897 --> 00:36:35,725
I hadn't had a chance
to say good-bye yet.

473
00:36:36,082 --> 00:36:37,215
Well, good-bye.

474
00:36:38,579 --> 00:36:40,419
And thanks again, Dr. Shephard.

475
00:36:47,999 --> 00:36:49,851
I went to see your father.

476
00:36:52,075 --> 00:36:53,546
W-what?

477
00:36:53,666 --> 00:36:54,759
When you didn't
want the surgery,

478
00:36:54,879 --> 00:36:57,629
I felt like I had to understand why.
And, uh... you know,

479
00:36:57,661 --> 00:36:59,723
I thought that if I could find
out why you're in this chair...

480
00:36:59,843 --> 00:37:02,179
- that maybe...
- I was in a plane crash.

481
00:37:06,341 --> 00:37:10,891
I had, had my... my private
pilot's license for a week,

482
00:37:11,011 --> 00:37:16,893
and, uh, I begged my father to
be my first official passenger.

483
00:37:17,250 --> 00:37:19,545
He was terrified of flying.

484
00:37:20,300 --> 00:37:22,624
But I looked him right in
the eye and I told him he could

485
00:37:22,744 --> 00:37:24,281
trust me.

486
00:37:26,288 --> 00:37:27,977
And we barely got
off the ground.

487
00:37:28,295 --> 00:37:30,075
I-I still don't re...

488
00:37:31,827 --> 00:37:34,747
I don't remember
what I did wrong.

489
00:37:35,393 --> 00:37:36,903
<i>But it was my fault.
It was my fault</i>

490
00:37:37,976 --> 00:37:39,750
That this man who I
loved more than anything

491
00:37:39,790 --> 00:37:43,802
will never walk or... talk or...

492
00:37:50,525 --> 00:37:53,028
you know, the first
time you and I met... um,

493
00:37:53,545 --> 00:37:55,392
back at the... at the airport.

494
00:37:56,704 --> 00:37:58,813
You told me that
my father was gone...

495
00:37:59,508 --> 00:38:00,899
and, uh...

496
00:38:01,336 --> 00:38:03,525
It hurt to hear that,
but I knew you were right.

497
00:38:06,584 --> 00:38:08,241
Your father's gone
too, Mr. Locke.

498
00:38:08,361 --> 00:38:10,608
- Uh, no, no, he's not.
- Yes, he... he is,

499
00:38:10,728 --> 00:38:12,269
and you can punish yourself
as much as you want

500
00:38:12,295 --> 00:38:14,115
and that's never
gonna bring him back.

501
00:38:16,463 --> 00:38:18,132
What happened, happened...

502
00:38:18,489 --> 00:38:20,003
and...

503
00:38:20,972 --> 00:38:22,835
you can let it go.

504
00:38:24,168 --> 00:38:26,413
What makes you think
letting go is so easy?

505
00:38:27,557 --> 00:38:28,710
It's not.

506
00:38:29,027 --> 00:38:32,528
In fact, I don't really
know how to do it myself.

507
00:38:36,085 --> 00:38:38,421
And that's why I
was hoping that...

508
00:38:39,017 --> 00:38:41,395
maybe you could go first.

509
00:38:50,826 --> 00:38:52,449
Good-bye, Dr. Shephard.

510
00:39:00,506 --> 00:39:02,215
<i>I can help you, John.</i>

511
00:39:04,241 --> 00:39:05,786
I wish you believed me.

512
00:39:42,162 --> 00:39:43,387
Jack.

513
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:49,253
I couldn't find you.

514
00:39:49,373 --> 00:39:51,120
I couldn't find you.

515
00:39:53,533 --> 00:39:56,323
- Is he okay?
- He got hit in the head pretty hard,

516
00:39:56,443 --> 00:39:57,677
But he's breathing.

517
00:39:59,405 --> 00:40:01,227
What about Jin and Sun?

518
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:56,811
It sunk.

519
00:40:57,725 --> 00:40:59,950
What, t-the submarine?

520
00:41:01,401 --> 00:41:03,651
But... they...
they were all on it.

521
00:41:03,771 --> 00:41:05,051
Everyone.

522
00:41:05,538 --> 00:41:09,526
- What they're... they're all dead?
- Not all of them.

523
00:41:15,431 --> 00:41:17,358
Wait. W-where you going?

524
00:41:17,478 --> 00:41:19,127
To finish what I started.
