00:00:00,086 --> 00:00:01,502
Previously on <i>Lost.</i>

2
00:00:01,904 --> 00:00:03,008
When you were over there
James, you mentioned that

3
00:00:03,059 --> 00:00:05,487
you mentioned that Widmore had someone
guarding a room on his submarine...

4
00:00:05,488 --> 00:00:08,512
guarding something that
he didn't want you to see.

5
00:00:08,719 --> 00:00:10,276
Yeah, so?

6
00:00:10,286 --> 00:00:12,502
I don't like secrets.

7
00:00:13,178 --> 00:00:15,625
You told me you brought
me here to the island

8
00:00:15,790 --> 00:00:18,622
to do something very important.
When do we start?

9
00:00:21,371 --> 00:00:22,980
Run.

10
00:00:23,687 --> 00:00:25,371
These people are
extremely dangerous.

11
00:00:26,449 --> 00:00:27,376
We need to go now.

12
00:00:27,825 --> 00:00:30,996
- Lead the way.
- This man wants to leave the island,

13
00:00:31,538 --> 00:00:32,914
and that plane's the
only way he can do it.

14
00:00:33,119 --> 00:00:34,597
Do you wanna know where we're going?
We're gonna stop him.

15
00:00:34,982 --> 00:00:36,766
How are you gonna stop him from getting
on that plane?

16
00:00:36,982 --> 00:00:39,766
We have to destroy it.

17
00:00:39,993 --> 00:00:42,165
<i>In a world of conflict
and strife,</i>

18
00:00:43,069 --> 00:00:45,296
<i>there is but one fact we
all can agree upon...</i>

19
00:00:47,026 --> 00:00:49,999
<i>everybody loves Hugo.</i>

20
00:00:51,422 --> 00:00:53,169
<i>Born to humble surroundings,</i>

21
00:00:53,571 --> 00:00:55,727
<i>Hugo reyes has always been
a beacon of light</i>

22
00:00:56,114 --> 00:00:57,670
<i>for all who crossed his path.</i>

23
00:00:58,811 --> 00:01:01,470
<i>Hugo's lifelong love
affair with chicken</i>

24
00:01:01,816 --> 00:01:05,539
<i>led him to acquire and then expand the
Mr. Cluck's chain</i>

25
00:01:05,721 --> 00:01:07,693
<i>into a worldwide phenomenon.</i>

26
00:01:08,008 --> 00:01:10,164
<i>The exponential growth
of Hugo's success</i>

27
00:01:10,698 --> 00:01:11,555
<i>was startling.</i>

28
00:01:12,365 --> 00:01:14,899
<i>But financial success
wasn't the end,</i>

29
00:01:15,805 --> 00:01:17,141
<i>it was the beginning.</i>

30
00:01:18,173 --> 00:01:19,942
<i>Hugo and giving</i>

31
00:01:20,501 --> 00:01:21,750
<i>became synonymous...</i>

32
00:01:22,664 --> 00:01:23,325
<i>Parks...</i>

33
00:01:24,190 --> 00:01:25,252
<i>Playgrounds...</i>

34
00:01:25,583 --> 00:01:26,423
<i>Hospitals...</i>

35
00:01:27,029 --> 00:01:28,987
<i>The Mr. Cluck's house
for children.</i>

36
00:01:30,623 --> 00:01:33,148
<i>The philanthropy was
unparalleled...</i>

37
00:01:33,416 --> 00:01:35,187
Which brings us to this evening

38
00:01:35,453 --> 00:01:39,001
and the opening of the Hugo
Reyes paleontology wing

39
00:01:39,442 --> 00:01:42,054
at the Golden State
Natural History Museum...

40
00:01:42,509 --> 00:01:44,429
a lasting beacon of culture

41
00:01:44,688 --> 00:01:45,782
that bears the name

42
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:48,567
of one of our city's
greatest benefactors.

43
00:01:51,727 --> 00:01:52,671
Ladies and gentlemen,

44
00:01:53,167 --> 00:01:54,653
our man of the year...

45
00:01:55,057 --> 00:01:56,377
Hugo Reyes!

46
00:02:08,446 --> 00:02:09,246
Whoo!

47
00:02:15,088 --> 00:02:16,267
It's a pretty cool trophy, huh?

48
00:02:16,755 --> 00:02:18,943
Mm-hmm, Hugo. Oh,
you know we got the human fund

49
00:02:19,187 --> 00:02:22,191
- next Saturday night. Can you make it?
- Another trophy.

50
00:02:22,914 --> 00:02:24,905
<i>Everybody loves Hugo.</i>

51
00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:27,131
You know who doesn't?

52
00:02:27,886 --> 00:02:28,862
Women.

53
00:02:29,861 --> 00:02:30,416
Ma!

54
00:02:30,589 --> 00:02:32,232
You need a woman in your life,

55
00:02:32,374 --> 00:02:35,040
especially one who
has not nursed you.

56
00:02:35,331 --> 00:02:36,346
That's disgusting.

57
00:02:37,203 --> 00:02:38,951
And I'm too busy to meet someone.

58
00:02:39,279 --> 00:02:41,608
You're not too busy.
You're too scared.

59
00:02:41,759 --> 00:02:43,000
I'm not scared.

60
00:02:43,149 --> 00:02:46,256
- Good, because you have a date tomorrow.
- I do?

61
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:49,977
Grandpa Tito's neighbor's
daughter, Rosalita.

62
00:02:50,363 --> 00:02:52,338
She agreed to lunch with you.

63
00:02:53,107 --> 00:02:53,910
What's she like?

64
00:02:54,327 --> 00:02:56,569
- Willing to meet you.
- Ma.

65
00:02:56,813 --> 00:02:58,146
You're going!

66
00:02:58,591 --> 00:03:00,668
She's gonna love you.

67
00:03:01,186 --> 00:03:02,335
And if she doesn't,

68
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:05,236
we will find someone who does.

69
00:03:23,945 --> 00:03:25,596
A lot of crazy stuff's
been happening.

70
00:03:27,054 --> 00:03:30,093
I kinda wish I could talk
to you about it in person.

71
00:03:33,171 --> 00:03:35,486
A lot of people have come to
talk to me after they've...

72
00:03:36,866 --> 00:03:39,106
You know, gone.

73
00:03:41,427 --> 00:03:43,268
It would be nice
if you could, too.

74
00:03:43,873 --> 00:03:44,708
Hugo?

75
00:03:45,331 --> 00:03:46,747
You ready to go?

76
00:03:48,045 --> 00:03:49,233
Once I'm back, we're leaving.

77
00:03:49,909 --> 00:03:52,213
- Where you going?
- "The black rock."

78
00:03:52,410 --> 00:03:54,615
If we're gonna destroy that plane,
we'll need dynamite.

79
00:03:55,411 --> 00:03:56,736
You sure that's the right move?

80
00:03:56,822 --> 00:03:59,506
No. But it's the
only move we have.

81
00:04:01,877 --> 00:04:04,189
Well, you're the expert.

82
00:04:05,779 --> 00:04:07,249
Whose grave is this?

83
00:04:08,972 --> 00:04:10,263
Her name was Libby.

84
00:04:10,421 --> 00:04:12,119
She was in the tail
section of the plane.

85
00:04:13,211 --> 00:04:15,223
We were gonna have our first date.

86
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:18,936
It was gonna be, like, a picnic.

87
00:04:21,153 --> 00:04:22,732
But...

88
00:04:23,425 --> 00:04:25,009
Then she was murdered.

89
00:04:26,929 --> 00:04:29,058
I'm sorry.

90
00:04:32,245 --> 00:04:34,007
Yeah, me, too.

91
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:46,760
Hey.

92
00:04:56,397 --> 00:04:57,555
What are you doing here?

93
00:04:57,883 --> 00:05:00,378
I'm here to stop you from
getting everyone killed.

95
00:05:23,229 --> 00:05:24,920
You gonna say something?

96
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:30,427
Why should I trust you?

97
00:05:31,318 --> 00:05:32,807
You murdered Libby and Ana Lucia.

98
00:05:32,989 --> 00:05:33,746
That doesn't matter right now.

99
00:05:34,311 --> 00:05:35,923
What matters is you
going across the island

100
00:05:35,977 --> 00:05:38,820
to blow up that plane?
People are gonna die...

101
00:05:39,597 --> 00:05:41,171
a lot of people,
and it's gonna be your fault.

102
00:05:41,493 --> 00:05:42,509
What?

103
00:05:42,815 --> 00:05:45,151
Because people are listening
to you now, Hurley.

104
00:05:47,426 --> 00:05:49,058
Hurley.

105
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:52,320
Who are you talking to?

106
00:05:52,651 --> 00:05:53,130
Um...

107
00:05:55,798 --> 00:05:56,962
No one.

108
00:05:58,763 --> 00:06:00,447
Come on.

109
00:06:00,713 --> 00:06:01,753
We're leaving.

110
00:06:15,879 --> 00:06:17,625
Can I get you some more
homemade tortilla chips?

111
00:06:18,883 --> 00:06:20,630
Sure. Whatever.

112
00:06:22,163 --> 00:06:23,768
Uh, can you leave those?

113
00:06:24,382 --> 00:06:25,161
I'm meeting someone.

114
00:06:25,745 --> 00:06:26,964
She's running late.

115
00:06:27,121 --> 00:06:29,323
Right. Chips are on the way.

116
00:06:38,998 --> 00:06:40,878
Hugo?

117
00:06:45,007 --> 00:06:47,125
Uh, hi.

118
00:06:47,465 --> 00:06:48,565
Nice to meet you.

119
00:06:48,793 --> 00:06:49,579
Wow.

120
00:06:50,415 --> 00:06:52,810
Uh, I wasn't expecting
someone like you.

121
00:06:52,866 --> 00:06:54,053
Uh, I'm sorry?

122
00:06:54,405 --> 00:06:55,438
You know, someone who's so...

123
00:06:56,255 --> 00:06:57,575
pretty.

124
00:07:00,344 --> 00:07:02,791
Please. H-have a seat.

125
00:07:05,142 --> 00:07:06,607
You don't look like a Rosalita.

126
00:07:07,062 --> 00:07:09,715
Oh. Um, my name isn't Rosalita.

127
00:07:09,904 --> 00:07:12,217
I-it's Libby.

128
00:07:12,538 --> 00:07:15,275
So... you're not my blind date?

129
00:07:15,755 --> 00:07:18,202
No, I-I just saw you
from across the room.

130
00:07:19,713 --> 00:07:22,645
Well, how'd you know my name?

131
00:07:23,724 --> 00:07:27,924
Well, if I tell you,
you're gonna think I'm crazy.

132
00:07:28,050 --> 00:07:29,232
No, I won't.

133
00:07:35,722 --> 00:07:37,355
Hugo,

134
00:07:37,639 --> 00:07:41,041
do you believe that two
people can be connected,

135
00:07:42,958 --> 00:07:45,066
like soul mates?

136
00:07:48,249 --> 00:07:50,205
I guess.

137
00:07:52,914 --> 00:07:55,761
You don't remember me, do you?

138
00:07:56,982 --> 00:07:58,428
Should I?

139
00:07:59,234 --> 00:08:00,886
What are you doing, Elizabeth?

140
00:08:01,067 --> 00:08:02,287
Are you bothering this man?

141
00:08:02,428 --> 00:08:04,130
No. No, he... he's an old friend.

142
00:08:04,466 --> 00:08:06,916
Actually, we just... wait.
What's... what's going on?

143
00:08:06,957 --> 00:08:10,290
- I apologize for the intrusion. Come on.
- No, Dr. Brooks, if I could just...

144
00:08:10,293 --> 00:08:12,658
- Doctor?
- I'm sorry. She just wandered off.

145
00:08:12,706 --> 00:08:13,269
Wandered off from where?

146
00:08:13,424 --> 00:08:16,085
Everything that I said, Hugo,

147
00:08:16,649 --> 00:08:18,427
I meant it.

148
00:08:20,559 --> 00:08:22,054
Forgive us.

149
00:08:38,026 --> 00:08:39,139
Yeah, just four of us.

150
00:08:55,678 --> 00:08:57,134
All right, let's go.

151
00:08:58,806 --> 00:08:59,894
We have to make it
to the outriggers

152
00:09:00,139 --> 00:09:02,339
and across the channel to Hydra Island
before nightfall.

153
00:09:02,544 --> 00:09:04,567
- You have the dynamite?
- Four sticks...

154
00:09:05,235 --> 00:09:08,476
enough to destroy the cockpit
and all the instruments.

155
00:09:08,838 --> 00:09:10,157
That plane'll never fly.

156
00:09:10,677 --> 00:09:13,038
Um, I don't know if
that's a good idea.

157
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:15,791
I mean, for one thing,
that stuff's really unstable.

158
00:09:16,153 --> 00:09:19,103
You have to trust me. I've been
training my whole life for this.

159
00:09:19,370 --> 00:09:21,313
- To blow stuff up?
- To protect you.

160
00:09:21,470 --> 00:09:23,404
Yeah, but how is blowing
up the plane protecting us?

161
00:09:24,473 --> 00:09:25,662
With that plane gone,

162
00:09:25,812 --> 00:09:28,583
<i>- that thing won't be able to leave the island.
- Yeah, well, neither will we,</i>

163
00:09:28,889 --> 00:09:30,259
and then we'll be
stuck here with it,

164
00:09:30,550 --> 00:09:33,831
- and it'll be ary at us.
- Jacob said Richard would know what to do.

165
00:09:34,434 --> 00:09:37,574
- And Richard said to blow up the plane. Correct?
- Yes.

166
00:09:37,936 --> 00:09:40,531
Well, Jacob never said
anything about it to me.

167
00:09:41,254 --> 00:09:43,410
I mean, what if Richard's wrong?

168
00:09:43,503 --> 00:09:47,005
Hugo, I'm looking out for your
best interests, all of you.

169
00:09:47,383 --> 00:09:48,831
Nothing is more
important than this.

170
00:09:49,255 --> 00:09:51,056
That thing is evil,

171
00:09:51,253 --> 00:09:53,581
and God help us if it ever
leaves this island, bec...

172
00:10:10,862 --> 00:10:11,956
That gonna be a spear?

173
00:10:14,843 --> 00:10:16,990
I'm not sure what it's
gonna be yet, James.

174
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:20,348
When the time is right,
it'll tell me.

175
00:10:20,505 --> 00:10:22,292
- You talk to wood now?
- Sawyer.

176
00:10:22,449 --> 00:10:23,102
What?

177
00:10:27,632 --> 00:10:29,033
Something I can do for you two?

178
00:10:29,189 --> 00:10:31,546
Is there something you can do?
How about anything?

179
00:10:32,143 --> 00:10:33,865
Those bastards on the
other island grabbed Jin.

180
00:10:34,062 --> 00:10:35,558
We're just sitting around
twiddlin' our damn thumbs,

181
00:10:35,723 --> 00:10:36,508
doin' nothin' about it.

182
00:10:36,554 --> 00:10:39,915
There's a difference between
doing nothing and waiting.

183
00:10:41,078 --> 00:10:42,318
So what are we waiting for?

184
00:10:45,603 --> 00:10:48,197
You were only able to
come back to this island

185
00:10:48,354 --> 00:10:49,779
because you all did it together.

186
00:10:50,533 --> 00:10:51,988
If we're gonna get on
that plane and leave,

187
00:10:52,092 --> 00:10:53,302
it has to happen the same way.

188
00:10:54,749 --> 00:10:56,754
We're waing for your
friends to get here, Kate...

189
00:10:56,913 --> 00:10:59,290
Hugo, Sun, Jack...

190
00:11:00,263 --> 00:11:01,045
that's the only way

191
00:11:01,218 --> 00:11:05,386
we're ever getting off
this godforsaken rock.

192
00:11:05,518 --> 00:11:08,485
- Well, I don't see that happening.
- Well, let's just hope you're wrong.

193
00:11:19,038 --> 00:11:20,407
Where you been?

194
00:11:22,010 --> 00:11:23,734
Can I speak to you in private?

195
00:11:24,673 --> 00:11:26,489
Absolutely.

196
00:11:41,461 --> 00:11:43,097
Everything go all right?

197
00:11:43,631 --> 00:11:44,253
Yes.

198
00:11:45,310 --> 00:11:46,610
Did Widmore see you?

199
00:11:46,896 --> 00:11:49,557
- No, but his people did.
- And you let them live?

200
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:50,910
I didn't see the
point of killing them

201
00:11:51,073 --> 00:11:53,903
- when I had what I came for.
- So you found what they were hiding

202
00:11:53,904 --> 00:11:57,624
- in the submarine?
- I most certainly did.

203
00:12:41,781 --> 00:12:42,924
Now what?

204
00:12:44,741 --> 00:12:47,250
We get me dynamite or
else she died for nothing.

205
00:12:47,401 --> 00:12:48,249
Maybe she died to show us

206
00:12:48,407 --> 00:12:52,011
- to stay the hell away from dynamite.
- Well, Jack, that's a risk I'm willing to take.

207
00:12:52,168 --> 00:12:55,130
Richard, I promised Sun that
I'd get her off this island.

208
00:12:55,246 --> 00:12:57,370
Well, Jack, I-I wish
you hadn't done that.

209
00:12:57,526 --> 00:12:59,405
If it makes you feel any better, you can
blame it on me.

210
00:12:59,406 --> 00:13:01,203
I think Richard's right.

211
00:13:05,406 --> 00:13:07,203
It's the only choice we've got.

212
00:13:10,923 --> 00:13:12,305
Trust me, Jack.

213
00:13:16,767 --> 00:13:18,688
Okay.

214
00:13:19,370 --> 00:13:20,819
- Good.
- Let's get moving.

215
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:29,186
38? Number 38?

216
00:13:30,954 --> 00:13:33,013
Mr. Reyes!

217
00:13:33,193 --> 00:13:33,974
What an honor.

218
00:13:34,194 --> 00:13:36,727
Give me a bucket, family size.

219
00:13:36,865 --> 00:13:38,076
Of course. Right away, sir.

220
00:13:40,139 --> 00:13:41,114
41?

221
00:13:41,807 --> 00:13:42,869
Number 41?

222
00:13:50,387 --> 00:13:51,187
What?

223
00:13:56,575 --> 00:13:57,597
I'm sorry.

224
00:13:59,383 --> 00:14:00,493
Have I seen you before?

225
00:14:00,704 --> 00:14:02,985
I own the place.
Maybe you saw my commercial.

226
00:14:03,144 --> 00:14:04,535
You want a clucketeer keychain?

227
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:07,108
N-no. It's not that.

228
00:14:08,623 --> 00:14:12,132
Were you on Oceanic Flight 815?

229
00:14:12,392 --> 00:14:14,917
- About a week ago, from Sydney?
- Uh, yeah.

230
00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:17,614
- So was I.
- Wow. What a coincidence.

231
00:14:18,208 --> 00:14:20,323
Yeah. Listen, you mind if I join
you while I wait for my order?

232
00:14:22,408 --> 00:14:23,737
Be my guest.

233
00:14:23,879 --> 00:14:25,350
Ooh. That is a lot of chicken.

234
00:14:25,704 --> 00:14:29,896
- I eat when I'm depressed.
- Ah. So what's her name?

235
00:14:31,188 --> 00:14:33,885
I met a girl on a blind
date the other night.

236
00:14:34,042 --> 00:14:35,607
And you didn't-
it didn't go how you'd hoped?

237
00:14:35,796 --> 00:14:37,943
Mm. She was totally awesome,

238
00:14:38,219 --> 00:14:40,933
expect for one thing- she's crazy.

239
00:14:41,618 --> 00:14:44,032
Well, all women are a
little bit crazy, brother.

240
00:14:44,237 --> 00:14:47,784
No. This one actually
lives in the looney bin.

241
00:14:47,838 --> 00:14:50,378
I mean, I saw the van.
She's full-on nuts.

242
00:14:50,695 --> 00:14:51,887
I mean, she started sane,

243
00:14:52,370 --> 00:14:55,217
but then she told me that
we already knew each other...

244
00:14:55,358 --> 00:14:57,222
<i>and that? I'd remember.</i>

245
00:15:00,385 --> 00:15:01,817
Tell me something...

246
00:15:03,233 --> 00:15:05,022
did you believe her when
she said she knew you?

247
00:15:08,559 --> 00:15:09,944
Yeah.

248
00:15:11,441 --> 00:15:12,595
Kinda.

249
00:15:13,976 --> 00:15:15,754
You know, I say go with your gut.

250
00:15:17,493 --> 00:15:18,744
You know, maybe you should...

251
00:15:19,528 --> 00:15:22,564
You should try to find out where
she thinks she knew you from

252
00:15:23,846 --> 00:15:25,365
before you give up on her.

253
00:15:27,746 --> 00:15:29,913
42? Order 42?

254
00:15:30,084 --> 00:15:32,003
Ah, that's me, brother.

255
00:15:32,185 --> 00:15:33,058
Well...

256
00:15:33,586 --> 00:15:34,404
Uh...

257
00:15:35,687 --> 00:15:37,560
It was nice bumping into you.

258
00:15:47,694 --> 00:15:48,857
Hello.

259
00:15:49,355 --> 00:15:50,139
Hello.

260
00:15:50,345 --> 00:15:51,601
I'm sorry Sayid tied you up,

261
00:15:51,753 --> 00:15:54,261
but he was afraid you'd run before we
had a chance to talk.

262
00:15:54,262 --> 00:15:57,470
I don't blame him. Although as I explained
to him before he left,

263
00:15:59,028 --> 00:16:01,647
<i>I have nowhere to run to,
brother.</i>

264
00:16:03,771 --> 00:16:06,313
Well, if that's not the best
argument against captivity

265
00:16:06,404 --> 00:16:07,389
that I've ever heard,

266
00:16:07,892 --> 00:16:09,184
I don't know what is.

267
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:22,132
You mind if I ask you a
couple questions, Desmond?

268
00:16:22,770 --> 00:16:23,917
Not at all.

269
00:16:24,956 --> 00:16:28,354
Why did Charles Widmore bring
you back to the island?

270
00:16:29,282 --> 00:16:30,703
Considering I was kidnapped,

271
00:16:31,937 --> 00:16:34,116
you'd have to ask him.

272
00:16:36,672 --> 00:16:38,482
They had him under armed guard.

273
00:16:38,844 --> 00:16:40,219
He threw me into a wood shack

274
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:44,160
and blasted me with a massive
amount of electromagnetism.

275
00:16:46,205 --> 00:16:47,740
If you don't mind my asking,
Desmond,

276
00:16:47,904 --> 00:16:51,610
how can you be sure what it
was that he blasted you with?

277
00:16:52,010 --> 00:16:53,105
Experience.

278
00:16:57,573 --> 00:16:59,247
Do you know who I am?

279
00:16:59,609 --> 00:17:00,930
Of course.

280
00:17:03,511 --> 00:17:05,965
You're John Locke.

281
00:17:11,377 --> 00:17:13,792
Head back to camp.
I'll be back soon.

282
00:17:13,965 --> 00:17:14,921
Where are you going?

283
00:17:15,093 --> 00:17:16,776
Desmond and I need to take a walk.

284
00:17:23,629 --> 00:17:25,787
Something I'd like to show you.

285
00:17:35,227 --> 00:17:37,075
Kinda makes you think, doesn't it?

286
00:17:37,665 --> 00:17:38,554
What's that?

287
00:17:38,884 --> 00:17:39,819
Ilana.

288
00:17:40,630 --> 00:17:41,691
There she was,

289
00:17:42,314 --> 00:17:44,579
handpicked by Jacob,

290
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:48,598
trained to come and
protect you candidates.

291
00:17:50,242 --> 00:17:53,035
No sooner does she
tell you who you are,

292
00:17:54,104 --> 00:17:56,118
then she blows up.

293
00:17:58,249 --> 00:18:00,783
The island was done with her.

294
00:18:01,593 --> 00:18:05,675
Makes me wonder what's gonna
happen when it's done with us.

295
00:18:24,854 --> 00:18:27,175
All right, everyone.
This might take a few minutes.

296
00:18:27,819 --> 00:18:29,730
I don't want anyone but
me handling that dynamite,

297
00:18:29,903 --> 00:18:33,223
so I'm gonna go in alone.
Where's Hugo?

298
00:18:34,032 --> 00:18:35,596
- I thought he was up front with you.
- Run!

299
00:18:36,956 --> 00:18:38,489
Run!

300
00:18:38,749 --> 00:18:40,164
Go! Go! Go! Go!

301
00:19:00,708 --> 00:19:02,749
Why the hell did you do that?!

302
00:19:04,534 --> 00:19:06,737
I'm protecting us.

303
00:19:09,908 --> 00:19:11,488
- What the hell were you thinking?!
- Calm down.

304
00:19:11,646 --> 00:19:13,715
- Now what... what are we supposed to do now?
- That's it. That's enough.

305
00:19:13,904 --> 00:19:16,279
We're dead. We're all dead.

306
00:19:21,470 --> 00:19:23,334
A warning might have
been nice there, Hugo.

307
00:19:24,147 --> 00:19:25,679
I did say "run."

308
00:19:28,259 --> 00:19:29,705
Why'd you do that?

309
00:19:30,092 --> 00:19:31,225
Michael told me to.

310
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:32,924
Who?

311
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:35,131
Michael.

312
00:19:35,456 --> 00:19:36,385
He's one of the
people who come back

313
00:19:36,659 --> 00:19:38,128
and yell at me after they die.

314
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:40,945
He told me I had to stop everyone

315
00:19:41,057 --> 00:19:42,589
from blowing up the plane.

316
00:19:42,763 --> 00:19:46,349
So... no dynamite,
no more blowing up.

317
00:19:47,867 --> 00:19:49,321
That happen a lot,

318
00:19:49,494 --> 00:19:50,937
dead people yelling at you?

319
00:19:52,190 --> 00:19:53,613
It happens enough.

320
00:19:53,732 --> 00:19:56,628
And you just listen
to whatever they say?

321
00:19:58,100 --> 00:20:01,923
Dead people are more
reliable than alive people.

322
00:20:04,212 --> 00:20:05,774
How can I help you, Mr. Reyes?

323
00:20:07,291 --> 00:20:10,812
I wanted to ask you about
that girl the other day.

324
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:11,755
Libby?

325
00:20:13,016 --> 00:20:15,613
I was wondering if
maybe I could see her.

326
00:20:16,534 --> 00:20:19,389
Well, I don't think
that's a good idea.

327
00:20:19,593 --> 00:20:20,765
She's not well.

328
00:20:20,915 --> 00:20:21,891
Clearly, she's well enough

329
00:20:22,199 --> 00:20:25,450
for, like, a... fajita field trip.

330
00:20:25,548 --> 00:20:26,672
Well, that's my mistake.

331
00:20:26,869 --> 00:20:28,907
I misjudged her condition.

332
00:20:29,561 --> 00:20:31,297
Her condition?

333
00:20:32,093 --> 00:20:34,493
She has issues with reality.

334
00:20:34,831 --> 00:20:35,915
What do you mean?

335
00:20:36,041 --> 00:20:39,251
I just think it probably
wouldn't be a good idea

336
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:40,770
for you to see her right now.

337
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:43,144
It'll only confuse her.

338
00:20:43,293 --> 00:20:44,276
You said "probably,"

339
00:20:44,416 --> 00:20:46,651
which means you might
make an exception.

340
00:20:47,257 --> 00:20:48,533
Well, perhaps for family.

341
00:20:49,963 --> 00:20:51,374
Or a generous donor?

342
00:20:52,654 --> 00:20:53,394
I'm sorry?

343
00:20:57,838 --> 00:21:00,323
The rec room looked pretty
gnarly on my way in.

344
00:21:01,072 --> 00:21:02,903
What do you think 100k might buy?

345
00:21:29,362 --> 00:21:30,860
You remembered?

346
00:21:31,588 --> 00:21:32,969
No.

347
00:21:34,332 --> 00:21:35,638
I'm sorry.

348
00:21:37,739 --> 00:21:39,233
Then why are you here?

349
00:21:42,092 --> 00:21:44,380
Where is it you think
you know me from?

350
00:21:44,616 --> 00:21:46,164
Um, I'm not sure.

351
00:21:46,701 --> 00:21:47,344
I...

352
00:21:48,109 --> 00:21:50,125
I know it won't make sense.

353
00:21:51,361 --> 00:21:52,752
Try me.

354
00:21:58,801 --> 00:22:01,166
A few days ago, I was watching TV,

355
00:22:01,230 --> 00:22:03,649
and one of your
commercials came on.

356
00:22:03,805 --> 00:22:05,901
And the moment that I saw you,

357
00:22:06,174 --> 00:22:07,920
it was like I was
hit over the head.

358
00:22:08,093 --> 00:22:09,627
All these memories

359
00:22:10,249 --> 00:22:12,851
came washing back... of my life,

360
00:22:13,002 --> 00:22:15,858
only... it was...

361
00:22:17,525 --> 00:22:20,278
<i>Another life.</i>

362
00:22:21,944 --> 00:22:23,189
What kind of memories?

363
00:22:26,735 --> 00:22:29,064
There was a plane crash.

364
00:22:30,221 --> 00:22:31,628
And...

365
00:22:32,344 --> 00:22:34,844
I was on an island.

366
00:22:35,422 --> 00:22:36,866
And I was there?

367
00:22:37,115 --> 00:22:40,478
I think so. We... knew each other.

368
00:22:40,652 --> 00:22:41,494
We...

369
00:22:42,398 --> 00:22:43,972
liked each other.

370
00:22:46,254 --> 00:22:48,181
And then when I got here,

371
00:22:48,337 --> 00:22:51,252
it was almost like
I'd been here before.

372
00:22:51,443 --> 00:22:53,442
And for some reason, Hugo,

373
00:22:53,624 --> 00:22:56,886
I have a memory of
you being here, too.

374
00:22:58,162 --> 00:22:59,035
Um...

375
00:23:00,041 --> 00:23:02,229
This is the first time I've
ever been in a mental hospital.

376
00:23:02,653 --> 00:23:05,137
Yeah, I know. But I can't
get you out of my brain.

377
00:23:05,459 --> 00:23:08,048
That's why the other night when I saw you,
I had to talk to you,

378
00:23:08,176 --> 00:23:11,880
because if you remembered me...

379
00:23:16,787 --> 00:23:19,662
I wish I could, Libby, but...

380
00:23:20,042 --> 00:23:21,221
I can't.

381
00:23:24,397 --> 00:23:25,420
I'm sorry.

382
00:23:25,603 --> 00:23:26,546
It's okay.

383
00:23:27,452 --> 00:23:28,716
It's okay.

384
00:23:31,162 --> 00:23:32,201
I'm crazy.

385
00:23:32,877 --> 00:23:33,948
Yeah, probably,

386
00:23:34,112 --> 00:23:36,745
but... we all got
something, right?

387
00:23:38,785 --> 00:23:39,595
I mean, it takes a lot of guts

388
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:42,341
to go up to a total stranger
and tell them you know them

389
00:23:42,391 --> 00:23:46,407
from some bizarro
alternate universe.

390
00:23:50,283 --> 00:23:53,270
I'm scared just
saying "hi" to a girl.

391
00:23:57,293 --> 00:23:59,032
You're doing fine.

392
00:24:05,708 --> 00:24:07,795
Hey, can you ever, like...

393
00:24:08,662 --> 00:24:10,337
get outta here?

394
00:24:10,565 --> 00:24:12,808
On a day pass or...

395
00:24:13,043 --> 00:24:15,453
Yeah. I'm here voluntarily.

396
00:24:16,115 --> 00:24:17,356
Well...

397
00:24:18,875 --> 00:24:20,328
Would you like to...

398
00:24:21,259 --> 00:24:22,793
do something?

399
00:24:23,485 --> 00:24:24,366
You mean...

400
00:24:25,561 --> 00:24:27,429
A date?

401
00:24:28,229 --> 00:24:29,495
Uh...

402
00:24:30,297 --> 00:24:31,555
Yeah.

403
00:24:34,733 --> 00:24:36,912
I'd love that.

404
00:24:41,112 --> 00:24:42,481
Remind me, Desmond...

405
00:24:42,937 --> 00:24:45,343
How long were you down in that hatch,
pushing that button?

406
00:24:45,715 --> 00:24:46,579
Three years.

407
00:24:47,746 --> 00:24:49,720
And here you are, back for more.

408
00:24:50,703 --> 00:24:53,362
If I didn't know better,
I'd say this island has it in for you.

409
00:24:53,542 --> 00:24:54,424
<i>Do you know better?</i>

410
00:24:54,990 --> 00:24:55,643
Excuse me?

411
00:24:56,108 --> 00:24:58,026
Well, there's nothing
special about me, brother.

412
00:24:58,270 --> 00:25:00,740
This island has it
in for all of us.

413
00:25:02,149 --> 00:25:03,619
Yes, it does.

414
00:25:05,155 --> 00:25:06,169
What?

415
00:25:08,301 --> 00:25:09,097
Who's that?

416
00:25:12,353 --> 00:25:13,662
Just ignore him.

417
00:25:16,844 --> 00:25:19,694
- Do you know that boy?
- I said ignore him.

418
00:25:30,847 --> 00:25:31,759
Where you going?

419
00:25:32,436 --> 00:25:34,660
Ben, back at the Dharma barracks...

420
00:25:34,787 --> 00:25:36,507
There's still grenades there?
Explosives?

421
00:25:36,980 --> 00:25:39,731
- Yes, I think so.
- Then that's where we're going.

422
00:25:40,038 --> 00:25:44,456
- Maybe we should talk about this a minute.
- Talk? There's no time to talk, but if you know

423
00:25:44,653 --> 00:25:46,399
what we need to do,
if you know how we stop that thing

424
00:25:46,570 --> 00:25:48,316
from leaving the island
without blowing that plane up,

425
00:25:48,563 --> 00:25:50,960
- then let's hear it. Let's all hear it.
- I know what we need to do.

426
00:25:51,779 --> 00:25:53,423
Really? What's that?

427
00:25:55,711 --> 00:25:57,238
We have to go talk to Locke.

428
00:25:57,380 --> 00:25:58,576
Are you trying to get us killed?

429
00:25:58,732 --> 00:26:03,030
It's not my idea. It's his.

430
00:26:08,302 --> 00:26:10,614
Jacob says we have
to talk to Locke.

431
00:26:10,875 --> 00:26:12,220
Jacob's here right now?

432
00:26:12,345 --> 00:26:13,289
Yeah.

433
00:26:17,828 --> 00:26:19,693
Ask him what the island is.

434
00:26:20,636 --> 00:26:21,518
What?

435
00:26:22,368 --> 00:26:24,641
A while back, Jacob told
me what the island was,

436
00:26:25,199 --> 00:26:26,575
and if he's really standing
here right next to me,

437
00:26:26,726 --> 00:26:28,026
then just ask him.

438
00:26:38,447 --> 00:26:40,209
I don't have to prove
anything to you, Richard.

439
00:26:41,867 --> 00:26:43,102
You either come with me

440
00:26:44,565 --> 00:26:46,611
or you can keep trying
to blow stuff up.

441
00:26:48,494 --> 00:26:49,619
Your call, dude.

442
00:26:54,678 --> 00:26:56,495
He's lying.

443
00:26:57,343 --> 00:26:58,649
Jacob isn't telling us what to do

444
00:26:58,831 --> 00:27:00,749
<i>because Jacob never tells
us what to do.</i>

445
00:27:00,915 --> 00:27:01,842
I'm gonna make this simple...

446
00:27:02,244 --> 00:27:05,241
If that thing leaves the island, that's it.
I-it's over.

447
00:27:05,515 --> 00:27:08,458
- What's over?
- Everything. I'm destroying that plane,

448
00:27:09,629 --> 00:27:11,353
and I can use all
the help I can get.

449
00:27:12,477 --> 00:27:13,736
Who's coming with me?

450
00:27:18,212 --> 00:27:19,817
I am.

451
00:27:27,517 --> 00:27:29,931
I saw that thing in action, man.
It doesn't want to talk.

452
00:27:31,907 --> 00:27:32,608
Sorry.

453
00:27:36,161 --> 00:27:37,326
Anyone else?

454
00:27:40,817 --> 00:27:41,778
Sorry, Richard.

455
00:27:41,983 --> 00:27:44,319
If Jacob says we go talk to Locke,
we go talk to Locke.

456
00:27:46,879 --> 00:27:49,253
- I'm going with Hugo.
- Really?

457
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:54,683
Don't get in our way.

458
00:28:00,953 --> 00:28:02,071
All right, Hurley.

459
00:28:03,675 --> 00:28:05,154
Let's go talk to Locke.

460
00:28:27,736 --> 00:28:29,183
Probably.

461
00:28:32,896 --> 00:28:33,999
So what do you think we should...

462
00:28:34,549 --> 00:28:36,829
say to Locke when we get there?

463
00:28:37,648 --> 00:28:38,836
I mean...

464
00:28:39,944 --> 00:28:41,872
How do you break the ice
with the smoke monster?

465
00:28:42,942 --> 00:28:43,963
Don't worry about it.

466
00:28:44,941 --> 00:28:47,417
Something tells me he's gonna
do most of the talking.

467
00:28:48,974 --> 00:28:50,848
Or he could just kill us all.

468
00:28:51,831 --> 00:28:53,796
Yeah, he could.

469
00:28:55,573 --> 00:28:57,139
I didn't see Jacob back there.

470
00:28:58,452 --> 00:29:00,984
Uh, I just said it 'cause I
wanted everyone to listen to me.

471
00:29:02,543 --> 00:29:03,951
I know.

472
00:29:04,792 --> 00:29:05,940
Then why'd you come with me?

473
00:29:08,568 --> 00:29:09,952
Ever since Juliet died,

474
00:29:11,635 --> 00:29:12,832
ever since I got her killed,

475
00:29:14,703 --> 00:29:16,609
all I've wanted was to fix it.

476
00:29:18,466 --> 00:29:20,140
But I can't.

477
00:29:20,919 --> 00:29:22,178
I can't ever fix it.

478
00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:26,597
You have no idea how hard
it is for me to sit back

479
00:29:26,842 --> 00:29:29,901
and listen to other people
tell me what I should do.

480
00:29:30,948 --> 00:29:33,797
But I think maybe
that's the point.

481
00:29:34,551 --> 00:29:35,461
Maybe...

482
00:29:37,281 --> 00:29:39,492
<i>Maybe I'm supposed to let go.</i>

483
00:29:41,274 --> 00:29:45,648
Unless you letting
go gets us killed.

484
00:29:46,004 --> 00:29:48,121
Going to see Locke was my idea,

485
00:29:48,129 --> 00:29:49,474
not Jacob's.

486
00:29:51,364 --> 00:29:54,590
Hurley, you asked me to trust you.

487
00:29:54,849 --> 00:29:57,768
This is me trusting you.

488
00:29:57,876 --> 00:29:59,751
Well, it's a good
thing you do, dude,

489
00:29:59,752 --> 00:30:03,053
'cause I have no
idea where I'm going.

490
00:30:10,599 --> 00:30:14,083
Wait. It's cool. I think I
know what these things are.

491
00:30:14,273 --> 00:30:17,254
Oh, yeah? What the hell are they?

492
00:30:17,678 --> 00:30:18,569
Wait here.

493
00:30:30,541 --> 00:30:31,438
Hey. You around?

494
00:30:32,739 --> 00:30:33,766
Michael?

495
00:30:41,524 --> 00:30:43,170
You're stuck on the island,
aren't you?

496
00:30:44,293 --> 00:30:45,872
Because of what I did.

497
00:30:46,170 --> 00:30:47,241
And...

498
00:30:48,019 --> 00:30:49,656
There are others out here...

499
00:30:50,363 --> 00:30:52,565
Like you, aren't there?

500
00:30:53,415 --> 00:30:55,190
That's what the whispers are?

501
00:30:56,074 --> 00:30:57,335
Yeah.

502
00:30:58,579 --> 00:31:00,733
We're the ones who can't move on.

503
00:31:06,094 --> 00:31:08,163
Do you know where Locke is?

504
00:31:10,279 --> 00:31:11,330
There.

505
00:31:14,845 --> 00:31:16,139
Thanks.

506
00:31:17,834 --> 00:31:18,641
Is...

507
00:31:19,695 --> 00:31:23,595
Is there anything I
can do to help you?

508
00:31:24,152 --> 00:31:25,547
Don't get yourself killed.

509
00:31:28,126 --> 00:31:29,223
Okay.

510
00:31:29,474 --> 00:31:30,486
Mm.

511
00:31:32,285 --> 00:31:33,356
And, Hurley?

512
00:31:37,195 --> 00:31:38,887
If you ever do see Libby again...

513
00:31:44,958 --> 00:31:48,004
Tell her I'm very sorry.

514
00:31:51,123 --> 00:31:52,654
I'll be sure and do that, dude.

515
00:32:01,093 --> 00:32:03,689
I got, like, six different
kinds of cheeses.

516
00:32:03,855 --> 00:32:04,772
I don't even know what they are,

517
00:32:04,773 --> 00:32:06,421
but the lady at the store
said they were good, so...

518
00:32:07,614 --> 00:32:08,403
I figured you'd like cheese

519
00:32:08,616 --> 00:32:11,865
because everybody likes cheese.

520
00:32:18,275 --> 00:32:19,360
Is something wrong?

521
00:32:19,517 --> 00:32:21,263
No, not wrong, just...

522
00:32:21,910 --> 00:32:22,900
Off.

523
00:32:25,898 --> 00:32:27,360
Have you been here before?

524
00:32:27,588 --> 00:32:28,388
No.

525
00:32:30,052 --> 00:32:33,631
It's just... being here with
you feels so familiar.

526
00:32:33,868 --> 00:32:37,194
It's like a date we never had.

527
00:32:39,793 --> 00:32:42,577
Wow. I sound completely
insane, don't I?

528
00:32:43,442 --> 00:32:44,276
No.

529
00:32:45,731 --> 00:32:47,108
Not completely.

530
00:32:47,912 --> 00:32:49,852
Why do you even wanna be with me?

531
00:32:51,852 --> 00:32:52,881
Why you wanna be with me?

532
00:32:53,746 --> 00:32:54,651
What?

533
00:32:56,004 --> 00:32:56,789
Come on.

534
00:32:56,979 --> 00:32:57,979
Look at me.

535
00:32:59,095 --> 00:33:00,637
I want to be with you...

536
00:33:01,510 --> 00:33:03,933
Because I like you.

537
00:33:05,757 --> 00:33:06,985
Yeah, but...

538
00:33:07,862 --> 00:33:09,612
You like me because...

539
00:33:12,428 --> 00:33:15,426
Well, you're... delusional.

540
00:33:33,847 --> 00:33:34,916
What? What's wrong?

541
00:33:39,516 --> 00:33:40,217
Whoa.

542
00:33:41,641 --> 00:33:42,758
- Dude.
- What?

543
00:33:49,637 --> 00:33:50,799
I...

544
00:33:51,820 --> 00:33:54,023
I think I'm remembering stuff.

545
00:33:55,461 --> 00:33:56,356
You are?

546
00:34:01,101 --> 00:34:03,210
You mean I'm not crazy?

547
00:34:04,281 --> 00:34:06,669
No, I don't think you are.

548
00:34:32,457 --> 00:34:33,244
We're here.

549
00:34:39,630 --> 00:34:40,937
What is it?

550
00:34:41,221 --> 00:34:42,124
It's a well.

551
00:34:57,401 --> 00:34:58,860
Let me guess...

552
00:34:59,316 --> 00:35:00,536
You're wondering how deep it is.

553
00:35:02,031 --> 00:35:03,999
You read my mind.

554
00:35:12,991 --> 00:35:15,297
You have any idea how old
this well is, Desmond?

555
00:35:16,123 --> 00:35:17,490
Very old?

556
00:35:19,777 --> 00:35:22,067
That's exactly right. Very old.

557
00:35:23,357 --> 00:35:24,836
So old, in fact,

558
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:27,202
that the people who dug this well

559
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:29,791
did it completely by hand.

560
00:35:30,791 --> 00:35:31,970
God knows how long it took 'em.

561
00:35:33,134 --> 00:35:35,314
Well, it seems like a lot of
work just to get some water.

562
00:35:35,479 --> 00:35:36,815
Oh, they weren't
looking for water.

563
00:35:37,858 --> 00:35:39,489
They were looking for answers.

564
00:35:40,750 --> 00:35:41,503
A long time ago,

565
00:35:41,686 --> 00:35:43,730
places like the one we're
standing at right now

566
00:35:44,162 --> 00:35:47,064
made compass needles spin.

567
00:35:47,254 --> 00:35:49,055
And the people
holding the compasses

568
00:35:49,203 --> 00:35:50,535
needed to know why,

569
00:35:51,603 --> 00:35:53,469
so they dug.

570
00:35:55,158 --> 00:35:56,789
Did they find what
they were looking for?

571
00:35:57,094 --> 00:35:58,936
No, they didn't.

572
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:04,021
The reason I wanted you
to see this, Desmond,

573
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:06,219
is because Charles Widmore

574
00:36:06,810 --> 00:36:08,657
is not interested in answers.

575
00:36:09,081 --> 00:36:10,954
He's only interested in power.

576
00:36:11,889 --> 00:36:13,696
And he brought you
back to this island

577
00:36:13,697 --> 00:36:16,421
so that you could help him
find what he's looking for.

578
00:36:16,656 --> 00:36:19,058
After all,
this isn't the only well.

579
00:36:22,045 --> 00:36:23,390
And that's the reason

580
00:36:25,245 --> 00:36:27,114
you wanted me to see this?

581
00:36:29,468 --> 00:36:31,426
Why aren't you afraid?

582
00:36:32,794 --> 00:36:34,117
Excuse me?

583
00:36:35,785 --> 00:36:37,161
You're out here,

584
00:36:38,450 --> 00:36:39,709
middle of the jungle,

585
00:36:39,949 --> 00:36:40,937
with me.

586
00:36:41,306 --> 00:36:44,130
Not a person on earth
even knows you're here.

587
00:36:45,020 --> 00:36:46,694
Why aren't you afraid?

588
00:36:49,888 --> 00:36:52,191
What is the point in being afraid?

589
00:37:02,281 --> 00:37:03,893
Aah!

590
00:37:13,887 --> 00:37:14,911
How is our friend?

591
00:37:16,125 --> 00:37:18,113
We don't have to worry
about him anymore.

592
00:37:25,399 --> 00:37:26,979
<i>Where you been?</i>

593
00:37:27,956 --> 00:37:29,709
I went for a walk, James.

594
00:37:30,252 --> 00:37:32,195
Well, now that you've stretched
your legs, maybe you can...

595
00:37:38,613 --> 00:37:40,413
Son of a bitch.

596
00:37:48,578 --> 00:37:51,856
Um... hey.

597
00:37:52,904 --> 00:37:54,248
Hello, Hugo.

598
00:37:56,545 --> 00:37:57,931
I don't know who you are, dude,

599
00:37:58,673 --> 00:38:00,521
or what you want,

600
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:04,075
but we have to talk to you.

601
00:38:04,683 --> 00:38:05,572
"We"?

602
00:38:07,452 --> 00:38:08,557
There are other people with me.

603
00:38:13,194 --> 00:38:14,387
But the thing is,

604
00:38:15,359 --> 00:38:16,846
you got weapons,
and we got weapons,

605
00:38:16,986 --> 00:38:18,616
and I don't want
anyone to get hurt...

606
00:38:19,621 --> 00:38:21,351
Or killed.

607
00:38:23,414 --> 00:38:25,371
So we're not gonna do anything,

608
00:38:27,582 --> 00:38:30,652
and I want your word that you're
not gonna do anything either.

609
00:38:41,329 --> 00:38:42,629
You have my word.

610
00:38:48,471 --> 00:38:49,298
Okay, guys.

611
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:50,541
Come on out.

612
00:39:16,038 --> 00:39:17,153
Hello, Jack.

613
00:39:46,017 --> 00:39:47,803
Hello there.

614
00:39:48,734 --> 00:39:50,637
Are you waiting for
someone in particular?

615
00:39:50,795 --> 00:39:52,762
Excuse me?

616
00:39:52,958 --> 00:39:54,452
Well, I noticed you've
been parked here a while,

617
00:39:54,670 --> 00:39:58,236
watching the kids, and,
well, it is a school.

618
00:40:00,517 --> 00:40:01,824
Do you have a child who goes here?

619
00:40:03,262 --> 00:40:05,709
No. No. I was, um,

620
00:40:05,952 --> 00:40:07,022
uh, I just moved to
the neighborhood,

621
00:40:07,188 --> 00:40:10,688
and, um, and, uh, I'm looking
for a school for my son.

622
00:40:10,924 --> 00:40:13,284
- What's your son's name?
- Charlie.

623
00:40:14,795 --> 00:40:17,680
Well, as a teacher here,
I can vouch for it completely.

624
00:40:17,845 --> 00:40:18,837
It's a wonderful school.

625
00:40:20,095 --> 00:40:21,542
That's great to hear. Thanks.

626
00:40:22,958 --> 00:40:24,706
Well, it was nice talking to you.

627
00:40:25,830 --> 00:40:27,097
Have a good day.

628
00:40:27,236 --> 00:40:28,036
Mm-hmm.

629
00:40:45,376 --> 00:40:46,006
Oh!

630
00:40:51,110 --> 00:40:53,102
Call 9-1-1! Do it now!

631
00:40:53,539 --> 00:40:54,539
Mr. Locke?

632
00:40:55,421 --> 00:40:56,585
Oh, my God.

633
00:40:57,096 --> 00:40:59,605
Don't... don't move. We're gonna
get you to the hospital.

634
00:40:59,763 --> 00:41:00,519
Mr. Locke?

635
00:41:01,689 --> 00:41:03,712
Mr. Locke, can you hear me?

636
00:41:03,713 --> 00:41:09,000
