1
00:01:18,164 --> 00:01:19,916
Aah! Aah!

2
00:02:11,532 --> 00:02:13,221
That's a lovely name.

3
00:02:19,956 --> 00:02:21,461
Where are the rest
of your people?

4
00:02:22,901 --> 00:02:23,821
There's only me.

5
00:02:25,252 --> 00:02:26,477
How did you get here?

6
00:02:27,565 --> 00:02:28,915
The same way you got here...

7
00:02:30,685 --> 00:02:31,660
by accident.

8
00:02:36,765 --> 00:02:39,733
- How long have you...
- Every question I answer

9
00:02:40,309 --> 00:02:41,541
will simply lead to
another question.

10
00:02:42,173 --> 00:02:45,276
You should rest.
Just be grateful you're alive.

11
00:02:48,813 --> 00:02:51,227
There were other people
on my ship. I need to go...

12
00:02:51,313 --> 00:02:52,327
No.

13
00:02:52,341 --> 00:02:55,685
If there are other people on
the island, I will find them.

14
00:03:01,957 --> 00:03:02,964
The baby?

15
00:03:06,981 --> 00:03:08,109
Oh!

16
00:03:08,805 --> 00:03:09,645
Oh!

17
00:03:13,053 --> 00:03:14,308
It's coming.

18
00:03:21,853 --> 00:03:22,573
That's it.

19
00:03:23,805 --> 00:03:26,676
Push! Push harder.

20
00:03:26,949 --> 00:03:27,597
I can't!

21
00:03:27,772 --> 00:03:29,203
Yes, you can.

22
00:03:31,645 --> 00:03:32,428
That's good!

23
00:03:32,949 --> 00:03:33,981
One more push.

24
00:03:39,998 --> 00:03:41,462
Oh! Oh!

25
00:03:47,949 --> 00:03:49,078
It's a boy.

26
00:03:58,062 --> 00:03:59,678
His name is Jacob.

27
00:04:00,389 --> 00:04:01,410
It's a boy.

28
00:04:10,551 --> 00:04:11,543
Can I...

29
00:04:20,390 --> 00:04:21,446
There's another baby.

30
00:04:22,045 --> 00:04:23,446
Aah!

31
00:04:23,973 --> 00:04:24,926
Push again.

32
00:04:26,886 --> 00:04:27,773
Here it comes.

33
00:04:28,942 --> 00:04:30,527
Now!

34
00:04:39,051 --> 00:04:40,058
It's another boy.

35
00:04:45,787 --> 00:04:47,939
I only picked one name.

36
00:05:03,499 --> 00:05:05,019
Oh. Shh. Shh.

37
00:05:06,755 --> 00:05:08,347
May I see him?

38
00:05:19,027 --> 00:05:20,059
I'm sorry.

39
00:05:21,644 --> 00:05:22,483
Uhh!

40
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:25,587
Uhh!

41
00:05:26,411 --> 00:05:28,379
Uhh! Uhh

42
00:05:35,485 --> 00:05:38,803
Season 6 Episode 15
 "Across The Sea"

43
00:06:20,419 --> 00:06:21,212
What is it?

44
00:06:23,275 --> 00:06:24,132
It's a game,

45
00:06:24,475 --> 00:06:25,244
you play it.

46
00:06:33,869 --> 00:06:35,003
How do you know how?

47
00:06:35,701 --> 00:06:36,636
I just know.

48
00:06:40,483 --> 00:06:41,804
Will you show me how to play?

49
00:06:42,732 --> 00:06:44,188
If you promise not
to tell mother.

50
00:06:45,132 --> 00:06:46,316
Why can't we tell her?

51
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:47,852
Because she'll take it away.

52
00:06:49,443 --> 00:06:52,315
So... do you wanna play
or don't you, Jacob?

53
00:06:58,116 --> 00:07:00,748
Yes. I wanna play.

54
00:07:12,368 --> 00:07:14,492
- Hello, Jacob.
- Hello, mother.

55
00:07:15,516 --> 00:07:16,556
Where's your brother?

56
00:07:18,036 --> 00:07:18,948
He's down at the beach...

57
00:07:22,796 --> 00:07:24,148
Staring out at the ocean.

58
00:07:30,492 --> 00:07:31,692
Can I help you?

59
00:07:32,156 --> 00:07:33,596
If you like, you can sort that.

60
00:07:39,788 --> 00:07:42,075
What were you and your brother
doing down at the beach?

61
00:07:42,732 --> 00:07:44,876
We were just... walking.

62
00:07:50,076 --> 00:07:51,462
Do you love me, Jacob?

63
00:07:57,251 --> 00:07:58,140
Yes.

64
00:07:58,804 --> 00:08:00,110
Then tell me what happened.

65
00:08:16,068 --> 00:08:17,284
May I join you?

66
00:08:19,316 --> 00:08:20,044
Sure.

67
00:08:28,332 --> 00:08:29,908
Jacob told you what I found.

68
00:08:30,268 --> 00:08:31,196
Of course he did.

69
00:08:31,812 --> 00:08:33,204
Jacob doesn't know how to lie.

70
00:08:34,187 --> 00:08:35,124
He's not like you.

71
00:08:37,621 --> 00:08:38,883
Why? What am I like?

72
00:08:40,180 --> 00:08:41,076
You're...

73
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:44,868
special.

74
00:08:50,788 --> 00:08:51,956
Can I keep the game?

75
00:08:53,036 --> 00:08:54,091
Of course you can.

76
00:08:54,455 --> 00:08:55,788
That's why I left it for you.

77
00:08:56,773 --> 00:08:57,971
It came from you?

78
00:08:58,292 --> 00:09:01,364
Of course it did.
Where else would it come from?

79
00:09:04,076 --> 00:09:05,219
From somewhere else.

80
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:07,932
Across the sea.

81
00:09:11,171 --> 00:09:12,620
There is nowhere else.

82
00:09:13,883 --> 00:09:15,564
The island is all there is.

83
00:09:16,716 --> 00:09:18,316
Then where did we come from?

84
00:09:20,059 --> 00:09:21,668
You and your
brother came from me -

85
00:09:21,851 --> 00:09:23,139
and I came from my mother.

86
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:24,756
Where is she?

87
00:09:26,515 --> 00:09:27,956
She's dead.

88
00:09:28,454 --> 00:09:29,501
What's "dead"?

89
00:09:32,748 --> 00:09:35,684
Something you will never
have to worry about.

90
00:09:54,738 --> 00:09:56,058
Hurry up! He's getting away!

91
00:10:03,635 --> 00:10:04,523
Hide!

92
00:10:23,670 --> 00:10:25,038
- Who are they?
- Shh!

93
00:10:42,919 --> 00:10:44,053
Mother!

94
00:10:44,863 --> 00:10:45,990
Mother!

95
00:10:48,591 --> 00:10:49,654
What's wrong?

96
00:10:50,902 --> 00:10:53,158
<i>We saw people. Men.</i>

97
00:10:53,694 --> 00:10:56,725
- How many were there?
- Three. They killed a boar.

98
00:10:56,990 --> 00:10:58,086
Did they see you?

99
00:10:59,206 --> 00:11:00,134
No.

100
00:11:00,277 --> 00:11:01,542
I don't think so.

101
00:11:01,710 --> 00:11:04,751
Where did they come from?
They looked like us.

102
00:11:04,917 --> 00:11:06,110
<i>They're not like us.</i>

103
00:11:06,734 --> 00:11:08,269
They don't belong here.

104
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:10,510
<i>We are here for a reason.</i>

105
00:11:10,654 --> 00:11:11,585
What reason?

106
00:11:18,410 --> 00:11:19,614
It's not time yet.

107
00:11:19,766 --> 00:11:22,334
<i>Mother, what reason?</i>

108
00:11:27,863 --> 00:11:29,061
Come with me.

109
00:11:37,390 --> 00:11:39,630
- Did you know about the people?
- Yes.

110
00:11:40,021 --> 00:11:41,525
Why didn't you
tell us about them?

111
00:11:41,685 --> 00:11:43,810
Because they're dangerous, and I
didn't want to frighten you.

112
00:11:43,885 --> 00:11:45,110
What makes them dangerous?

113
00:11:45,278 --> 00:11:47,158
The same thing that
makes all men dangerous.

114
00:11:47,317 --> 00:11:50,366
They come. They fight.
They destroy. They corrupt.

115
00:11:50,517 --> 00:11:51,958
And it always ends the same.

116
00:11:53,047 --> 00:11:57,086
- They "come"? Come from where?
- Another part of the island.

117
00:11:57,309 --> 00:11:58,654
<i>And you're never to go
looking for them.</i>

118
00:11:58,830 --> 00:11:59,981
If they found you,
they would hurt you.

119
00:12:00,109 --> 00:12:01,725
Why would they hurt us?

120
00:12:01,729 --> 00:12:03,525
Because they're people Jacob,
and that's what people do.

121
00:12:03,679 --> 00:12:06,317
<i>But we're people. Does that mean
that we can hurt each other?</i>

122
00:12:13,182 --> 00:12:16,157
I've made it so you can
never hurt each other.

123
00:12:27,773 --> 00:12:29,109
What is this place?

124
00:12:29,613 --> 00:12:31,693
This is the reason we're here.

125
00:12:48,958 --> 00:12:50,246
Don't go in there.

126
00:12:57,238 --> 00:12:58,813
What's down there?

127
00:12:58,998 --> 00:13:00,006
Light.

128
00:13:01,894 --> 00:13:03,238
The warmest,

129
00:13:04,182 --> 00:13:05,374
brightest light

130
00:13:05,551 --> 00:13:07,317
you've ever seen or felt.

131
00:13:09,214 --> 00:13:13,525
And we must make sure
that no one ever finds it.

132
00:13:14,975 --> 00:13:16,758
It's beautiful.

133
00:13:18,719 --> 00:13:20,374
Yes, it is.

134
00:13:20,542 --> 00:13:21,958
And that's why they want it,

135
00:13:22,254 --> 00:13:24,278
because a little bit
of this very same light

136
00:13:24,454 --> 00:13:26,534
is inside of every man.

137
00:13:28,077 --> 00:13:30,302
But they always want more.

138
00:13:30,581 --> 00:13:31,511
Can they take it?

139
00:13:31,710 --> 00:13:33,447
No, but they would try.

140
00:13:33,710 --> 00:13:35,726
And if they tried,
they could put it out.

141
00:13:36,046 --> 00:13:37,927
And if the light
goes out here...

142
00:13:40,661 --> 00:13:42,533
it goes out everywhere.

143
00:13:43,838 --> 00:13:45,823
And so I've protected this place,

144
00:13:46,421 --> 00:13:48,374
but I can't protect it forever.

145
00:13:49,262 --> 00:13:50,525
Then who will?

146
00:13:57,639 --> 00:13:59,639
It will have to be one of you.

147
00:14:20,347 --> 00:14:23,043
- You can't do that, Jacob.
- Why not?

148
00:14:23,283 --> 00:14:24,972
Because it's against the rules.

149
00:14:25,203 --> 00:14:27,155
- You made the rules.
- I found it.

150
00:14:27,355 --> 00:14:28,891
One day, you can make
up your own game,

151
00:14:29,035 --> 00:14:30,907
and everyone else will have
to follow your rules.

152
00:14:37,506 --> 00:14:38,611
<i>It's all right.</i>

153
00:14:40,604 --> 00:14:41,971
<i>Don't be afraid.</i>

154
00:14:45,651 --> 00:14:46,651
What?

155
00:14:51,667 --> 00:14:52,739
What's wrong?

156
00:14:52,939 --> 00:14:54,195
I'm going for a
walk to the beach.

157
00:14:55,507 --> 00:14:56,635
I'll meet you later.

158
00:15:03,283 --> 00:15:04,306
<i>Hello.</i>

159
00:15:08,211 --> 00:15:09,671
Why can't Jacob see you?

160
00:15:10,211 --> 00:15:11,403
<i>Because I'm dead.</i>

161
00:15:14,172 --> 00:15:17,499
<i>Will you come with me?
I'd like to show you something.</i>

162
00:15:18,548 --> 00:15:20,051
Show me what?

163
00:15:21,459 --> 00:15:22,987
<i>Where you came from.</i>

164
00:15:23,387 --> 00:15:27,003
It's across the island,
a place you've never seen.

165
00:15:53,019 --> 00:15:54,156
<i>Who are they?</i>

166
00:15:54,842 --> 00:15:57,187
They came here 13 years ago...

167
00:15:57,876 --> 00:15:59,931
the day before you were born.

168
00:16:00,723 --> 00:16:02,978
Their ship was wrecked
in a storm.

169
00:16:03,603 --> 00:16:05,764
Ship. What's that?

170
00:16:05,947 --> 00:16:08,987
It's a way for people to get
from one place to another.

171
00:16:10,147 --> 00:16:12,708
It's how we came across the sea.

172
00:16:13,467 --> 00:16:15,435
But there's nothing
across the sea.

173
00:16:15,803 --> 00:16:18,004
There are many things
across the sea.

174
00:16:20,387 --> 00:16:23,218
You come from across the sea, too.

175
00:16:23,491 --> 00:16:25,483
No. That's not true.

176
00:16:26,331 --> 00:16:28,499
That's not what
my mother told me.

177
00:16:29,307 --> 00:16:31,283
<i>She's not your mother.</i>

178
00:16:32,939 --> 00:16:34,571
<i>I am.</i>

179
00:16:52,946 --> 00:16:53,867
Jacob.

180
00:16:55,907 --> 00:16:56,907
Jacob, wake up.

181
00:16:59,154 --> 00:17:00,362
Come with me.

182
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:08,443
Why do you have all your things?

183
00:17:08,763 --> 00:17:09,875
<i>They're our things.</i>

184
00:17:10,979 --> 00:17:12,211
I took them because
we're leaving,

185
00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:14,715
- and we're never coming back.
- What?

186
00:17:15,107 --> 00:17:16,172
Just follow me.

187
00:17:17,146 --> 00:17:18,251
Follow you where?

188
00:17:20,107 --> 00:17:21,307
To the people.

189
00:17:21,467 --> 00:17:23,107
No. We're supposed to
stay away from them.

190
00:17:23,266 --> 00:17:25,754
They're our people, Jacob,
and we're gonna live with them.

191
00:17:25,915 --> 00:17:26,986
No, mother said...

192
00:17:27,131 --> 00:17:29,811
She lied. She lied about
everything... all of it.

193
00:17:30,251 --> 00:17:32,827
I know you don't understand,
but you have to come with me.

194
00:17:33,083 --> 00:17:35,708
- I don't want to go by myself.
- We can't. Mother loves us.

195
00:17:35,851 --> 00:17:36,811
- She doesn't love us.
- stop!

196
00:17:36,979 --> 00:17:38,083
- It was all a lie!
- Stop it!

197
00:17:38,235 --> 00:17:39,683
- She's not even our mother!
- Aah!

198
00:17:43,875 --> 00:17:46,227
No! Jacob!

199
00:17:46,554 --> 00:17:48,395
- What are you doing?
- He's leaving!

200
00:17:49,052 --> 00:17:50,164
He's going to them!

201
00:17:50,748 --> 00:17:52,107
To the other people!

202
00:17:53,956 --> 00:17:54,995
What?

203
00:17:56,339 --> 00:17:57,627
I know now.

204
00:17:58,236 --> 00:18:00,379
<i>There is another place
across the sea.</i>

205
00:18:00,683 --> 00:18:01,827
It's where I'm from,

206
00:18:02,283 --> 00:18:05,125
and I'm gonna go there.
I'm gonna go home.

207
00:18:05,634 --> 00:18:07,163
Who... who told you that?

208
00:18:07,340 --> 00:18:08,419
My mother!

209
00:18:11,555 --> 00:18:12,475
I'm your mother.

210
00:18:12,627 --> 00:18:14,187
You killed my mother.

211
00:18:19,043 --> 00:18:20,203
Jacob...

212
00:18:20,499 --> 00:18:22,100
she was your mother, too.

213
00:18:23,491 --> 00:18:27,164
<i>We don't belong here.
We don't belong with her.</i>

214
00:18:27,835 --> 00:18:29,243
Come with me.

215
00:18:36,875 --> 00:18:38,099
No.

216
00:18:41,948 --> 00:18:43,683
My love, you need to know this.

217
00:18:44,140 --> 00:18:46,563
Whatever you have been told,

218
00:18:47,204 --> 00:18:49,811
you will never be able
to leave this island.

219
00:18:49,978 --> 00:18:51,010
That's not true.

220
00:18:52,124 --> 00:18:54,076
And one day, I can prove it.

221
00:19:29,730 --> 00:19:32,599
- Do you think he'll come back?
- No.

222
00:19:35,996 --> 00:19:37,516
He said you killed our mother.

223
00:19:40,059 --> 00:19:41,004
Is that true?

224
00:19:44,491 --> 00:19:45,595
Yes.

225
00:19:48,673 --> 00:19:50,027
If I had let her live,

226
00:19:51,163 --> 00:19:53,402
she would have taken
you back to her people,

227
00:19:53,843 --> 00:19:57,147
and those people are bad,
Jacob... very bad.

228
00:19:58,420 --> 00:20:01,059
I-I couldn't let you
become one of them.

229
00:20:03,154 --> 00:20:05,259
I needed you to stay good.

230
00:20:07,283 --> 00:20:08,883
<i>Am I good, mother?</i>

231
00:20:11,331 --> 00:20:14,682
Yes. Of course you are.

232
00:20:17,922 --> 00:20:20,027
Then why do you love
him more than me?

233
00:20:28,803 --> 00:20:32,971
I love you in...
in different ways.

234
00:20:37,739 --> 00:20:39,916
Will you stay with me, Jacob?

235
00:20:42,762 --> 00:20:43,811
Please?

236
00:20:48,914 --> 00:20:49,891
Yes.

237
00:20:55,252 --> 00:20:56,419
For a while.

238
00:21:13,363 --> 00:21:14,323
What do you think?

239
00:21:17,626 --> 00:21:19,139
It's very nice, Jacob.

240
00:21:21,291 --> 00:21:22,492
Are you all right?

241
00:21:25,491 --> 00:21:26,723
I'm just tired.

242
00:21:51,915 --> 00:21:53,306
She know you visit me?

243
00:21:55,332 --> 00:21:56,939
She never asks about you.

244
00:21:57,483 --> 00:21:59,260
<i>Then I'm sorry I asked
about her.</i>

245
00:22:07,219 --> 00:22:08,810
Why do you watch us, Jacob?

246
00:22:11,514 --> 00:22:15,539
I watch because I wanna
know if mother's right.

247
00:22:15,867 --> 00:22:16,908
Right about what?

248
00:22:17,682 --> 00:22:18,682
About them.

249
00:22:19,299 --> 00:22:21,091
Oh, you mean my people.

250
00:22:21,795 --> 00:22:23,547
You wanna know if they're bad.

251
00:22:26,492 --> 00:22:27,722
That woman may be insane,

252
00:22:27,895 --> 00:22:29,747
but she's most definitely
right about that.

253
00:22:29,978 --> 00:22:32,570
I don't know.
They don't seem so bad to me.

254
00:22:32,803 --> 00:22:34,124
Well, that's easy
for you to say,

255
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:37,482
looking down at us
from above. Trust me.

256
00:22:37,963 --> 00:22:39,850
I've lived among
them for 30 years.

257
00:22:40,964 --> 00:22:45,211
They're greedy, manipulative,
untrustworthy...

258
00:22:46,818 --> 00:22:47,947
and selfish.

259
00:22:48,251 --> 00:22:49,547
Then why are you with them?

260
00:22:51,154 --> 00:22:52,739
They're a means to an end.

261
00:22:54,778 --> 00:22:55,876
What end?

262
00:23:04,668 --> 00:23:06,203
I'm leaving, Jacob.

263
00:23:09,339 --> 00:23:11,818
- I found a way off the island.
- No, it's impossible.

264
00:23:11,987 --> 00:23:13,124
<i>There is no way
off the island.</i>

265
00:23:41,267 --> 00:23:43,859
There are very smart
men among us.

266
00:23:43,979 --> 00:23:46,539
Men who are curious
about how things work.

267
00:23:46,867 --> 00:23:50,650
Together, we have discovered
places all over this island

268
00:23:50,947 --> 00:23:53,843
where metal behaves strangely.

269
00:23:54,306 --> 00:23:56,274
When we find one of these sites...

270
00:23:56,731 --> 00:23:57,779
we dig.

271
00:23:59,163 --> 00:24:01,180
And this time we
found something.

272
00:24:04,235 --> 00:24:06,875
Come with me Jacob, please.

273
00:24:10,146 --> 00:24:12,027
What are you gonna
do when she dies?

274
00:24:12,211 --> 00:24:13,034
She's never gonna die.

275
00:24:13,180 --> 00:24:15,083
Jacob, everything dies.

276
00:24:15,851 --> 00:24:17,260
Well, I don't wanna
leave this island.

277
00:24:18,131 --> 00:24:19,203
It's my home.

278
00:24:21,610 --> 00:24:23,259
Well, it's not mine.

279
00:24:32,467 --> 00:24:33,579
Where were you?

280
00:24:36,339 --> 00:24:37,571
You know where I was.

281
00:24:41,131 --> 00:24:43,602
What did he say to you, Jacob?

282
00:24:45,995 --> 00:24:48,323
He said he's finally found
a way to leave the island.

283
00:25:48,997 --> 00:25:50,278
May I join you?

284
00:25:53,373 --> 00:25:54,214
Yes.

285
00:26:06,174 --> 00:26:07,205
How are you?

286
00:26:08,045 --> 00:26:09,197
I'm worried.

345
00:26:10,142 --> 00:26:12,765
Well, mother... you should be.

287
00:26:13,085 --> 00:26:15,478
I've spent 30 years
searching for that place

288
00:26:15,607 --> 00:26:16,638
You brought me as a child.

289
00:26:16,942 --> 00:26:19,230
That... waterfall with
that beautiful light.

290
00:26:19,477 --> 00:26:22,030
I've walked this
island from end to end...

291
00:26:22,173 --> 00:26:24,262
not once coming
close to finding it.

292
00:26:25,934 --> 00:26:26,869
But then I began to think,

293
00:26:27,102 --> 00:26:29,453
What if the light
underneath the island...

294
00:26:29,855 --> 00:26:32,022
what if I could get to
it from someplace else?

295
00:26:33,686 --> 00:26:36,646
Figuring out how to reach
it took a very long time.

296
00:26:38,381 --> 00:26:40,486
The people with you...
they saw this, too?

297
00:26:41,134 --> 00:26:44,710
Yes. They have some
very interesting ideas

298
00:26:44,877 --> 00:26:45,950
about what to do with it.

299
00:26:46,110 --> 00:26:48,589
<i>Do with it? You don't
have any idea wh...</i>

300
00:26:48,741 --> 00:26:52,142
I have no idea because you
wouldn't tell me, mother.

301
00:27:26,589 --> 00:27:27,837
What is that?

302
00:27:28,613 --> 00:27:29,789
It's a wheel.

303
00:27:31,526 --> 00:27:32,838
We're going to
make an opening...

304
00:27:34,486 --> 00:27:36,834
One much bigger than this one.

305
00:27:37,965 --> 00:27:39,279
And then I'm going
to attach that wheel

306
00:27:39,437 --> 00:27:40,645
to a system we're building.

307
00:27:42,037 --> 00:27:45,222
A system that channels
the water and the light.

308
00:27:46,022 --> 00:27:47,517
And then I'm going to turn it.

309
00:27:48,149 --> 00:27:49,245
And when I do...

310
00:27:51,765 --> 00:27:54,542
I'll finally be able
to leave this place.

311
00:27:55,013 --> 00:27:58,822
How do you know all this?
How do you know it will work?

312
00:27:59,070 --> 00:28:00,333
I'm special...

313
00:28:00,934 --> 00:28:01,863
<i>Mother.</i>

314
00:28:03,054 --> 00:28:04,726
Please don't do this.

315
00:28:07,117 --> 00:28:08,382
Don't go.

316
00:28:08,549 --> 00:28:09,950
<i>I have to go.</i>

317
00:28:11,109 --> 00:28:13,509
- Why?
- Because I don't belong here.

318
00:28:18,590 --> 00:28:21,750
Then I suppose this is good-bye.

319
00:28:47,364 --> 00:28:48,694
Good-bye, mother.

320
00:28:58,166 --> 00:29:01,244
I am so sorry.

321
00:29:03,934 --> 00:29:04,717
Aah!

322
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:06,430
Uhh!

323
00:29:18,013 --> 00:29:18,910
Jacob.

324
00:29:23,926 --> 00:29:24,893
It's time.

325
00:29:31,685 --> 00:29:32,805
Something happened, didn't it?

326
00:29:32,950 --> 00:29:35,038
Yes. I had to say
good-bye to your brother.

327
00:29:35,415 --> 00:29:36,378
You're letting him go?

328
00:29:36,725 --> 00:29:39,366
I don't have a choice.
It's what he wants.

329
00:29:45,861 --> 00:29:47,445
Do you recognize this place?

330
00:29:48,445 --> 00:29:49,206
Yes.

331
00:29:49,742 --> 00:29:52,405
Do you remember what
I showed you here?

332
00:29:53,197 --> 00:29:55,134
The light.

333
00:29:57,158 --> 00:29:59,053
You're going to protect it now.

334
00:30:05,206 --> 00:30:06,423
What's down there?

335
00:30:06,891 --> 00:30:09,237
Life, death...

336
00:30:10,174 --> 00:30:11,277
rebirth.

337
00:30:12,021 --> 00:30:15,365
It's the source,
the heart of the island.

338
00:30:23,990 --> 00:30:25,349
Just promise me...

339
00:30:26,414 --> 00:30:30,141
<i>no matter what you do,
you won't ever go down there.</i>

340
00:30:35,101 --> 00:30:36,309
Would I die?

341
00:30:36,670 --> 00:30:38,622
It'd be worse than dying Jacob.

342
00:30:39,597 --> 00:30:40,822
Much worse.

343
00:31:11,806 --> 00:31:12,719
Here...

344
00:31:12,967 --> 00:31:14,046
drink this.

345
00:31:14,958 --> 00:31:16,462
What happens if I do?

346
00:31:16,798 --> 00:31:18,566
You'll accept the responsibility

347
00:31:19,398 --> 00:31:23,053
that you will protect this
place for as long as you can.

348
00:31:24,486 --> 00:31:26,502
And then you'll have to
find your replacement.

349
00:31:26,661 --> 00:31:27,735
I don't want to
protect this place.

350
00:31:27,877 --> 00:31:29,774
- Someone has to.
- I don't care.

351
00:31:29,891 --> 00:31:31,475
My time is over.

352
00:31:31,493 --> 00:31:33,518
- Why? Why is your time over?
- It has to be you, Jacob.

353
00:31:33,702 --> 00:31:35,781
<i>No, it doesn't.
You wanted it to be him.</i>

354
00:31:39,005 --> 00:31:41,637
But now I'm all you have.

355
00:31:45,157 --> 00:31:47,629
It was always supposed
to be you, Jacob.

356
00:31:48,694 --> 00:31:51,942
I see that now...
and one day you'll see it, too.

357
00:31:52,078 --> 00:31:53,269
But until then...

358
00:31:55,286 --> 00:31:57,478
you don't really have a choice.

359
00:32:00,878 --> 00:32:01,981
Please...

360
00:32:02,358 --> 00:32:04,798
take the cup and drink.

361
00:32:38,190 --> 00:32:39,958
Now you and I...

362
00:32:40,388 --> 00:32:41,525
are the same.

363
00:34:40,149 --> 00:34:41,948
Storm comin'.

364
00:34:42,629 --> 00:34:43,684
Yes, there is.

365
00:34:45,892 --> 00:34:49,028
You should go get some firewood...

366
00:34:49,988 --> 00:34:51,148
before it rains.

367
00:34:55,126 --> 00:34:56,156
Jacob...

368
00:34:58,605 --> 00:35:00,256
be careful.

369
00:35:00,796 --> 00:35:02,624
I'll see you back home.

370
00:36:37,387 --> 00:36:39,945
Why wouldn't you let
me leave, mother?

371
00:36:40,596 --> 00:36:44,957
Because I... I love you.

372
00:36:47,971 --> 00:36:49,541
Thank you.

373
00:37:11,997 --> 00:37:13,005
Jacob.

374
00:37:13,307 --> 00:37:14,301
What'd you do?

375
00:37:14,605 --> 00:37:15,917
Wait. Listen.

376
00:37:17,132 --> 00:37:18,564
- What did you do?
- No.

377
00:37:18,741 --> 00:37:20,068
- What did you do?!
- No. Wait...

378
00:37:35,980 --> 00:37:37,644
Don't. Jacob, don't do this.

379
00:37:38,988 --> 00:37:41,469
She burned them. She was crazy,

380
00:37:41,629 --> 00:37:43,272
she burned them all!

381
00:37:43,972 --> 00:37:46,405
You can't kill me, Jacob.
She made it that way.

382
00:37:46,556 --> 00:37:47,628
You can't!

383
00:37:47,641 --> 00:37:50,548
Don't worry, brother...
I'm not going to kill you.

384
00:37:51,156 --> 00:37:52,556
Uhh!

385
00:38:05,765 --> 00:38:08,300
- She brought you back here?
- Yes.

386
00:38:08,710 --> 00:38:09,820
Why would she?

387
00:38:10,373 --> 00:38:12,484
Because I have to protect it now.

388
00:38:14,917 --> 00:38:16,588
Aah!

389
00:38:16,764 --> 00:38:18,444
You want to find the light?

390
00:38:18,805 --> 00:38:20,381
You want to leave
this place, brother?

391
00:38:20,412 --> 00:38:21,993
Then go.

392
00:38:22,100 --> 00:38:22,700
Uhh!

393
00:41:10,379 --> 00:41:12,131
Who are they?
Where'd they come from?

394
00:41:12,315 --> 00:41:14,008
Didn't you guys shoot a
polar bear last week?

395
00:41:14,015 --> 00:41:15,708
Yeah.

396
00:41:15,988 --> 00:41:17,467
<i>Where'd that come from?</i>

397
00:41:34,300 --> 00:41:37,236
Hello? Anybody there?

398
00:41:40,364 --> 00:41:41,460
Who were these men?

399
00:41:41,628 --> 00:41:43,676
Actually, one of them's female.

400
00:41:46,820 --> 00:41:48,716
Our very own Adam and Eve.

401
00:41:57,723 --> 00:41:59,412
Good-bye, brother.

402
00:42:05,603 --> 00:42:06,996
Good-bye.

403
00:42:09,597 --> 00:42:11,997
