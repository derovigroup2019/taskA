1
00:00:00,187 --> 00:00:01,715
Previously on Lost.

2
00:00:02,487 --> 00:00:04,215
Anything over $10,000
has to be declared.

3
00:00:04,465 --> 00:00:07,487
You... didn't declare this.

4
00:00:07,607 --> 00:00:09,389
Sir, you're gonna
have to come with me.

5
00:00:09,637 --> 00:00:12,144
- I told you people, I don't know anything!
- Dude, just calm down!

6
00:00:12,199 --> 00:00:13,806
Why did you follow me?!
Your wife sent me!

7
00:00:13,926 --> 00:00:15,059
There's something we have to do.

8
00:00:15,179 --> 00:00:17,403
She said you have to stop
the man in black.

9
00:00:17,889 --> 00:00:20,307
You have to stop him
from leaving the island.

10
00:00:21,968 --> 00:00:23,986
What's on Hydra Island?

11
00:00:24,106 --> 00:00:27,283
A plane. The same plane
that brought your friends back.

12
00:00:27,403 --> 00:00:30,396
So I want you to go over there
and do some recon.

13
00:00:30,516 --> 00:00:32,373
Who are you?

14
00:00:32,493 --> 00:00:34,451
Put your weapon down!

15
00:00:34,571 --> 00:00:35,835
Take me to your leader.

16
00:00:35,955 --> 00:00:38,580
So why don't you tell me what
brought you over to this island?

17
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:41,646
John Locke sent me.
Well, here's the deal, chief.

18
00:00:41,766 --> 00:00:44,477
I'll go back over there
and tell him the coast is clear,

19
00:00:44,585 --> 00:00:45,825
that I didn't find anybody.

20
00:00:45,945 --> 00:00:48,523
Then I'll bring the old man
right to your doorstep.

21
00:00:48,643 --> 00:00:50,982
And what do you want
in exchange, James?

22
00:00:50,983 --> 00:00:53,755
You give us safe passage
off the island.

23
00:01:05,836 --> 00:01:07,646
Want some cocoa?

24
00:01:08,913 --> 00:01:10,741
Where'd you find cocoa?

25
00:01:10,861 --> 00:01:14,322
I didn't. Pretend.

26
00:01:26,088 --> 00:01:28,226
How's the leg?

27
00:01:30,812 --> 00:01:31,858
Still hurts.

28
00:01:32,993 --> 00:01:35,293
You should leave the bandage off
for a while. The air'll do it some good.

29
00:01:35,794 --> 00:01:36,900
I'll try that.

30
00:01:37,585 --> 00:01:39,111
You mind if I sit down?

31
00:01:46,273 --> 00:01:47,959
I know you and I haven't
had time to talk,

32
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:51,073
but I was wondering
if James had filled you in

33
00:01:51,074 --> 00:01:53,388
on what I showed him
at the cliffs.

34
00:01:53,508 --> 00:01:57,342
You mean the cave. The one
with the names on the wall.

35
00:01:57,343 --> 00:01:59,877
Most of the names
have been crossed off now.

36
00:02:00,993 --> 00:02:02,611
There are just a few left.

37
00:02:03,824 --> 00:02:05,504
"Kwon" is one of them.

38
00:02:06,006 --> 00:02:08,503
Does that mean me or Sun?

39
00:02:08,975 --> 00:02:10,759
Well, Jin, I'm not sure.

40
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:14,820
But what it does mean is that
the only way we can leave the island

41
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:17,851
is if all the names
that haven't been crossed off

42
00:02:17,852 --> 00:02:19,644
go together.

43
00:02:20,130 --> 00:02:21,617
But Sun's not here.

44
00:02:23,779 --> 00:02:25,489
You just take care
of that leg.

45
00:02:25,609 --> 00:02:26,905
I'm workin' on it.

46
00:02:37,155 --> 00:02:38,629
All right, Mr. Kwon,

47
00:02:38,891 --> 00:02:41,938
here's your suitcase
and your watch.

48
00:02:46,662 --> 00:02:47,795
Money?

49
00:02:48,267 --> 00:02:51,864
I'm sorry. Federal law says we have
to confiscate your $25,000.

50
00:02:52,999 --> 00:02:55,439
- C-confiscate?
- It means that if you want it back,

51
00:02:55,764 --> 00:02:58,196
you're gonna have to fill out
the necessary paperwork.

52
00:02:58,469 --> 00:03:00,118
Uh... money.

53
00:03:00,238 --> 00:03:01,869
You can exit
right over there, sir.

54
00:03:36,043 --> 00:03:37,321
May I help you?

55
00:03:38,890 --> 00:03:40,276
Paik.

56
00:03:40,438 --> 00:03:42,397
A reservation for Paik.

57
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:44,383
Yes.
I've got it right here.

58
00:03:44,503 --> 00:03:47,670
We've got a beautiful ocean view
room for you on the 8th floor.

59
00:03:48,446 --> 00:03:50,937
Two room. Two.

60
00:03:52,645 --> 00:03:53,830
No marry.

61
00:03:55,112 --> 00:03:56,065
Oh.

62
00:03:56,185 --> 00:03:57,954
Kwon. Jin Soo Kwon.

63
00:03:58,396 --> 00:04:01,155
I'm sorry. I apologize.

64
00:04:01,426 --> 00:04:04,434
Yes, there is a separate
room reservation for Kwon.

65
00:04:04,932 --> 00:04:06,805
Room 842. Here you go, sir.

66
00:04:06,925 --> 00:04:10,357
Miss. Paik, Mr. Kwon,
welcome to Los Angeles.

67
00:04:15,615 --> 00:04:18,800
I'm leaving for a little while.
I got an errand to run.

68
00:04:19,655 --> 00:04:20,953
When will you be back?

69
00:04:21,203 --> 00:04:22,147
Morning.

70
00:04:22,604 --> 00:04:24,705
Keep an eye on the camp
while I'm gone.

71
00:04:26,239 --> 00:04:27,963
I don't feel anything.

72
00:04:32,024 --> 00:04:33,572
Excuse me?

73
00:04:34,766 --> 00:04:35,842
Anger,

74
00:04:36,092 --> 00:04:37,018
happiness...

75
00:04:37,792 --> 00:04:39,186
pain.

76
00:04:40,092 --> 00:04:42,068
I don't feel it anymore.

77
00:04:43,854 --> 00:04:45,741
Maybe that's best, Sayid.

78
00:04:47,932 --> 00:04:50,217
It'll help you get through
what's comin'.

79
00:05:11,114 --> 00:05:12,227
What are you doin', Hoss?

80
00:05:12,347 --> 00:05:14,217
I'm getting out of here
before that thing comes back.

81
00:05:14,218 --> 00:05:15,418
What thing?

82
00:05:15,693 --> 00:05:17,353
Locke.

83
00:05:17,733 --> 00:05:19,202
And you're just
sitting around here,

84
00:05:19,247 --> 00:05:22,544
- listening to whatever he tells you.
- I ain't listenin' to nobody.

85
00:05:22,664 --> 00:05:24,400
I already told you
I have a deal with Widmore.

86
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:25,671
So if you just calm...

87
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:26,971
It doesn't matter who
you have a deal with.

88
00:05:26,991 --> 00:05:29,666
I've waited long enough.
I'm going to find my wife.

89
00:05:30,331 --> 00:05:33,770
- Find her where?
- I'll go back to the temple.

90
00:05:33,890 --> 00:05:35,627
And if she's not there,
I'll try the beach.

91
00:05:35,747 --> 00:05:37,810
But I will find Sun,
so stop trying to...

92
00:05:45,976 --> 00:05:47,842
Go! Uhh!

93
00:05:49,552 --> 00:05:51,188
Aah!
Uhh!

94
00:06:03,888 --> 00:06:05,377
Is this the guy?

95
00:06:08,293 --> 00:06:11,242
Yeah. Let's take him.

96
00:06:17,898 --> 00:06:25,471
Lost Season 6 Episode 10
     "The package"

97
00:06:29,794 --> 00:06:32,035
Play your card, Captain.

98
00:06:34,295 --> 00:06:35,627
Now what?

99
00:06:37,197 --> 00:06:38,397
We wait.

100
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:40,099
Wait... for what?

101
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:42,567
For Richard to come back.

102
00:06:42,568 --> 00:06:44,533
You'll forgive my scepticism, but

103
00:06:45,093 --> 00:06:48,306
the last thing Richard said before
he went stomping off into the jungle,

104
00:06:48,307 --> 00:06:49,690
was that we were all in hell,

105
00:06:49,810 --> 00:06:52,359
and he had no idea what
we were supposed to do next.

106
00:06:52,609 --> 00:06:56,179
In fact, I would bet money
we never see him again.

107
00:06:56,180 --> 00:06:57,647
Hugo will find him.

108
00:06:57,648 --> 00:06:59,682
He will track him down
and bring him back.

109
00:06:59,683 --> 00:07:01,602
Unless Alpert's covered
in bacon grease,

110
00:07:01,633 --> 00:07:05,019
- I'm not sure Hurley can track anything.
- Hey. Don't talk about bacon.

111
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:07,555
Jacob has never lied to me before.

112
00:07:07,556 --> 00:07:10,338
If he said Richard knows what to do,
then Richard knows what to do.

113
00:07:11,163 --> 00:07:12,682
He'll come back.

114
00:07:12,802 --> 00:07:15,696
And until then, we wait.

115
00:07:35,132 --> 00:07:36,782
How are the tomatoes?

116
00:07:38,909 --> 00:07:39,926
Dead.

117
00:07:42,490 --> 00:07:44,872
I remember when you
first planted this here.

118
00:07:45,812 --> 00:07:47,861
It feels like a hundred years ago.

119
00:07:50,073 --> 00:07:52,364
You don't believe Alpert's
coming back, do you?

120
00:07:53,375 --> 00:07:55,633
I don't care
if he comes back.

121
00:07:55,634 --> 00:07:57,348
What about us...

122
00:07:58,121 --> 00:07:59,534
being candidates?

123
00:07:59,535 --> 00:08:01,134
What about it?

124
00:08:04,169 --> 00:08:06,452
Hurley took me
to a lighthouse.

125
00:08:07,438 --> 00:08:09,206
To Jacob's lighthouse.

126
00:08:09,839 --> 00:08:12,227
And... there was a mirror,

127
00:08:13,347 --> 00:08:14,881
and all around it, there were...

128
00:08:15,047 --> 00:08:16,581
there were hundreds of
names written down.

129
00:08:16,701 --> 00:08:20,552
I don't care. I don't care about
Alpert or being a candidate.

130
00:08:20,553 --> 00:08:22,320
Sun...

131
00:08:22,835 --> 00:08:24,530
There's a reason why
we were brought...

132
00:08:24,650 --> 00:08:27,611
I don't wanna hear about how
this is our purpose or destiny!

133
00:08:29,603 --> 00:08:32,498
I just want you to go away
and leave me alone.

134
00:10:51,477 --> 00:10:52,844
Sun.

135
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:57,081
I'm sorry. I didn't
mean to startle you.

136
00:11:01,778 --> 00:11:03,429
Bad day?

137
00:11:05,043 --> 00:11:06,650
What are you doing here?

138
00:11:08,590 --> 00:11:10,241
I found your husband.

139
00:11:11,508 --> 00:11:12,540
What?

140
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:15,159
I promised you
I would reunite you two.

141
00:11:15,163 --> 00:11:17,766
Took me a little longer
than I thought it would.

142
00:11:18,099 --> 00:11:21,501
But he's with my people back
at my camp across the island.

143
00:11:24,266 --> 00:11:26,418
I can take you
to him right now.

144
00:11:28,977 --> 00:11:31,110
I don't believe you.

145
00:11:31,946 --> 00:11:34,276
You killed those
people at the temple.

146
00:11:35,647 --> 00:11:37,534
Those people were confused.

147
00:11:37,654 --> 00:11:39,216
They were lied to.

148
00:11:39,978 --> 00:11:41,833
I didn't want to hurt them.

149
00:11:41,953 --> 00:11:44,670
Any one of them could've
chosen to come with me.

150
00:11:45,584 --> 00:11:48,258
And I'm giving you
that choice, Sun, right now.

151
00:11:50,228 --> 00:11:52,719
I would never make you
do anything against your will.

152
00:11:52,999 --> 00:11:54,297
I'm asking you.

153
00:11:54,547 --> 00:11:56,163
Please.

154
00:11:57,210 --> 00:11:58,668
Come with me.

155
00:11:59,495 --> 00:12:01,352
Jin is waiting.

156
00:12:10,090 --> 00:12:11,505
Sun!

157
00:12:19,748 --> 00:12:21,561
Sun, wait!

158
00:14:12,171 --> 00:14:13,073
Miss. Paik.

159
00:14:13,371 --> 00:14:14,373
Hi.

160
00:14:14,512 --> 00:14:16,619
I'm, uh, Martin Keamy.

161
00:14:19,668 --> 00:14:21,909
I'm a friend of your father's.

162
00:14:24,502 --> 00:14:25,976
You mind if I come in?

163
00:14:26,448 --> 00:14:28,873
I believe you've got
something for me. Hmm?

164
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:35,374
Sun?

165
00:14:37,672 --> 00:14:39,530
Sun, can you hear me?

166
00:14:40,448 --> 00:14:41,562
What happened?

167
00:14:43,322 --> 00:14:44,546
You all right?

168
00:14:48,999 --> 00:14:50,343
I'm sorry, what?

169
00:14:56,399 --> 00:14:58,069
Sun, slow do. Tell me
what happened in English.

170
00:14:58,401 --> 00:15:00,001
Who did this to you?

171
00:15:01,276 --> 00:15:02,534
Locke.

172
00:15:33,121 --> 00:15:34,300
Sayid.

173
00:15:36,561 --> 00:15:37,806
Sayid.

174
00:15:37,926 --> 00:15:39,109
Hey.

175
00:15:42,731 --> 00:15:43,755
What happened?

176
00:15:44,426 --> 00:15:45,909
We were attacked.

177
00:15:45,910 --> 00:15:47,345
By whom?

178
00:15:48,215 --> 00:15:49,822
I don't know.

179
00:15:51,981 --> 00:15:54,333
Where is Jin?

180
00:16:15,416 --> 00:16:16,787
Hey!

181
00:16:19,141 --> 00:16:20,439
Hey!

182
00:16:50,719 --> 00:16:52,827
Wow, that was weird, huh?

183
00:16:55,072 --> 00:16:56,428
Where am I?

184
00:16:57,143 --> 00:16:58,846
It's called room 23.

185
00:16:59,846 --> 00:17:02,234
The Dharma Initiative
was doing experiments

186
00:17:02,271 --> 00:17:04,090
on subliminal messaging in here.

187
00:17:04,210 --> 00:17:08,043
But you know all about the Dharma
Initiative, don't you Mr. Kwon?

188
00:17:08,163 --> 00:17:11,825
- Why did you bring me here?
- Relax. You're safe.

189
00:17:11,945 --> 00:17:13,536
I'm leaving.

190
00:17:18,057 --> 00:17:19,340
Sorry.

191
00:17:20,191 --> 00:17:21,412
But we went
to a lot of trouble

192
00:17:21,470 --> 00:17:23,373
getting you here
of the other island.

193
00:17:25,874 --> 00:17:27,407
And I can't let you leave.

194
00:17:28,587 --> 00:17:29,972
What do you want from me?

195
00:17:34,436 --> 00:17:37,606
These are grid maps that...
that the Dharma people used

196
00:17:37,726 --> 00:17:40,515
to identify pockets
of electromagnetism.

197
00:17:41,479 --> 00:17:43,705
Whoever signed these
could really help me out.

198
00:17:44,274 --> 00:17:47,959
Uh, I know... I know
the writing's difficult to read,

199
00:17:48,079 --> 00:17:52,009
but... but it sure looks like
it says, "Jin Soo Kwon."

200
00:17:52,465 --> 00:17:53,688
So...

201
00:17:53,931 --> 00:17:55,671
Is it you or isn't it?

202
00:17:56,728 --> 00:17:58,870
You want answers
to your questions?

203
00:17:59,564 --> 00:18:01,406
Then get me your boss.

204
00:18:03,301 --> 00:18:06,146
I want to talk
with Charles Widmore.

205
00:18:08,003 --> 00:18:09,595
Well, then you're in luck...

206
00:18:10,192 --> 00:18:13,646
Mr. Kwon. Because he'd like
to talk to you, too.

207
00:18:17,555 --> 00:18:18,984
You a good swimmer?

208
00:18:19,343 --> 00:18:21,579
- Good enough.
- Wrap this in plastic.

209
00:18:21,699 --> 00:18:24,256
You don't want it to get wet.
We're taking the outrigger.

210
00:18:30,197 --> 00:18:32,069
Something wrong, Claire?

211
00:18:42,046 --> 00:18:43,371
Um...

212
00:18:44,493 --> 00:18:46,100
What... what you said to Jin...

213
00:18:46,944 --> 00:18:48,580
about the names on the wall.

214
00:18:49,194 --> 00:18:51,435
You told him you needed
them all to get off the island.

215
00:18:51,730 --> 00:18:52,894
Yes, I did.

216
00:18:53,588 --> 00:18:55,888
Was, uh... was my name
on the wall?

217
00:18:57,642 --> 00:18:58,778
No.

218
00:18:59,722 --> 00:19:01,922
Well, then it doesn't matter
if I get on that plane, then.

219
00:19:01,949 --> 00:19:03,159
I mean, you don't need me.

220
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:05,159
No, that's not true
Claire. I need you.

221
00:19:09,522 --> 00:19:11,568
And there's plenty of room
on that plane for all of us.

222
00:19:16,227 --> 00:19:19,028
Well, when we go home,
Aaron's not gonna know me.

223
00:19:19,677 --> 00:19:22,650
Stranger to my own son,
he thinks Kate's his mother.

224
00:19:27,316 --> 00:19:28,760
Is her name on the wall?

225
00:19:30,863 --> 00:19:32,617
No, Claire, it isn't...

226
00:19:33,118 --> 00:19:34,644
not anymore.

227
00:19:34,909 --> 00:19:36,369
But I need Kate.

228
00:19:36,944 --> 00:19:38,271
Why?

229
00:19:39,129 --> 00:19:41,790
Because I'm three people shy
of getting off this island,

230
00:19:41,910 --> 00:19:44,370
and Kate can help me get
these people on that plane.

231
00:19:47,476 --> 00:19:50,038
But once she does...

232
00:19:52,479 --> 00:19:55,427
then whatever happens, happens.

233
00:20:02,975 --> 00:20:04,619
What's up with the guns?

234
00:20:05,046 --> 00:20:06,622
You two going somewhere?

235
00:20:07,543 --> 00:20:09,761
We're taking a boat ride
over to the other island.

236
00:20:09,881 --> 00:20:11,162
What do you need a boat for?

237
00:20:11,282 --> 00:20:14,294
Can't you just turn into smoke
and fly your ass over the water?

238
00:20:14,682 --> 00:20:17,778
Do you think if I could do that,
I would still be on this island?

239
00:20:17,898 --> 00:20:20,078
No, 'cause that'd be
ridiculous.

240
00:20:21,670 --> 00:20:24,058
What the hell you going
over there for, anyway?

241
00:20:24,564 --> 00:20:26,923
I thought you were trying
to avoid Charlie Widmore.

242
00:20:28,702 --> 00:20:30,810
They took one of
our people, James.

243
00:20:31,429 --> 00:20:33,242
So I'm going to get them back.

244
00:20:54,956 --> 00:20:56,476
Oh, this for me?

245
00:20:59,379 --> 00:21:01,477
Uh, this is really nice.

246
00:21:02,671 --> 00:21:04,897
Your bodyguard is supposed
to give me some money.

247
00:21:05,017 --> 00:21:06,077
Where's Mr. Kwon?

248
00:21:06,817 --> 00:21:08,468
No English.

249
00:21:09,131 --> 00:21:10,591
Hmm?

250
00:21:11,901 --> 00:21:13,596
All right. Uh, sit down.

251
00:21:22,861 --> 00:21:24,999
I checked his room.
He's not there.

252
00:21:32,488 --> 00:21:33,830
Check the bathroom.

253
00:21:42,694 --> 00:21:43,785
Come on. Let's go.

254
00:21:43,962 --> 00:21:47,676
Mr. Kwon, why don't you
come and join us?

255
00:21:52,955 --> 00:21:55,874
Look, thank you
for the watch, okay?

256
00:21:56,683 --> 00:21:59,440
But you're also supposed to give me
an envelope with money in it...

257
00:21:59,469 --> 00:22:01,356
$25,000.

258
00:22:01,236 --> 00:22:01,996
Yeah?

259
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:08,623
Stop that.

260
00:22:08,807 --> 00:22:10,987
I feel like I'm in a
damn "Godzilla" movie.

261
00:22:12,353 --> 00:22:14,173
What's that guy's name? The, um...

262
00:22:15,093 --> 00:22:17,000
The Russian guy... speaks like,
nine different languages.

263
00:22:17,095 --> 00:22:18,573
Uh, uh, Danny's friend.

264
00:22:18,693 --> 00:22:21,277
- Mikhail.
- Mikhail. Can he speak Korean?

265
00:22:21,297 --> 00:22:24,065
- I think so.
- Okay, go get him.

266
00:22:29,870 --> 00:22:31,503
Now put your damn clothes on.

267
00:22:36,822 --> 00:22:39,811
She says the money her father
gave them was taken at customs.

268
00:22:41,142 --> 00:22:42,911
Mm, that's not my problem.

269
00:22:48,086 --> 00:22:49,914
She wants you to let them
please go to the bank.

270
00:22:50,034 --> 00:22:51,401
They will get it for you.

271
00:23:02,364 --> 00:23:04,298
You take her to the bank.

272
00:23:04,299 --> 00:23:07,033
I'll take Casanova here
to the restaurant.

273
00:23:08,236 --> 00:23:09,681
And then we'll meet there.

274
00:23:21,090 --> 00:23:22,483
What's he whining about?

275
00:23:22,484 --> 00:23:24,638
He wants you to promise,
that you won't tell her father

276
00:23:24,675 --> 00:23:26,052
that they are involved.

277
00:23:27,990 --> 00:23:30,822
Oh, hey, don't worry about that.

278
00:23:30,942 --> 00:23:33,461
Okay. Your secret
is safe with me.

279
00:23:34,018 --> 00:23:35,684
Okay? Just bring me the money,

280
00:23:35,804 --> 00:23:38,279
and then we can all live
happily ever after, right?

281
00:23:54,095 --> 00:23:55,449
What?

282
00:23:56,041 --> 00:23:58,678
Oh, for the fourth time,
I was gathering mangoes,

283
00:23:58,723 --> 00:24:00,765
and she was already
unconscious when I found her.

284
00:24:00,885 --> 00:24:03,254
- Why won't you believe me?
- Because you're speaking.

285
00:24:04,377 --> 00:24:05,793
You got a pretty
decent-sized bump.

286
00:24:06,456 --> 00:24:08,181
Might be a slight concussion.

287
00:24:09,224 --> 00:24:10,558
You can understand
what I'm saying,

288
00:24:10,678 --> 00:24:12,777
but you can only speak Korean.

289
00:24:14,746 --> 00:24:17,574
She hits her head
and forgets English?

290
00:24:18,276 --> 00:24:19,733
Are we supposed to buy that?

291
00:24:19,853 --> 00:24:22,218
Asked the man who
communes with the dead.

292
00:24:22,701 --> 00:24:24,264
It might be aphasia.

293
00:24:25,099 --> 00:24:28,027
It's, um, a condition
that's caused by trauma

294
00:24:28,059 --> 00:24:29,916
and affects the language
centre of your brain.

295
00:24:30,036 --> 00:24:31,536
But it's usually temporary.

296
00:24:32,426 --> 00:24:33,670
Sun.

297
00:24:34,049 --> 00:24:35,372
You're gonna be okay.

298
00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:38,959
What are you smiling about?

299
00:24:47,979 --> 00:24:49,719
Pack your bags. We're leaving.

300
00:25:10,346 --> 00:25:11,938
Don't move!

301
00:25:13,324 --> 00:25:15,181
Let me see your hands!

302
00:25:16,066 --> 00:25:19,147
Easy, friend.
I come in peace.

303
00:25:40,715 --> 00:25:42,145
Do you know who I am?

304
00:25:42,956 --> 00:25:44,563
Charles Widmore.

305
00:25:45,322 --> 00:25:46,973
Do you know who I am?

306
00:25:47,581 --> 00:25:49,675
Obviously, you're not John Locke.

307
00:25:50,013 --> 00:25:52,497
Everything else I know
is a combination of myth,

308
00:25:52,617 --> 00:25:55,016
ghost stories and jungle
noises in the night.

309
00:25:55,070 --> 00:25:58,566
I think you know more than that,
judging by these... pylons.

310
00:26:00,334 --> 00:26:01,646
Why did you come here?

311
00:26:02,479 --> 00:26:04,808
You took one of
my people, Jin Kwon.

312
00:26:05,912 --> 00:26:08,197
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

313
00:26:15,755 --> 00:26:19,956
A wise man once said that
war was coming to this island.

314
00:26:22,892 --> 00:26:24,985
I think it just got here.

315
00:26:33,105 --> 00:26:35,229
Where exactly are we going, Richard?

316
00:26:36,016 --> 00:26:37,564
- Where's Locke?
- What?

317
00:26:37,684 --> 00:26:40,055
You said he came to recruit you.
Where did he say he'd be?

318
00:26:40,503 --> 00:26:41,451
Hydra Island.

319
00:26:41,571 --> 00:26:43,109
Which is exactly where
you landed the plane

320
00:26:43,125 --> 00:26:45,265
- that you flew back here, right?
- That's right.

321
00:26:45,385 --> 00:26:47,978
This... man wants 
to leave the island,

322
00:26:48,098 --> 00:26:49,545
and that plane's the
only way he can do it.

323
00:26:49,585 --> 00:26:51,323
You wanna know where we're
going? We're gonna stop him.

324
00:26:51,443 --> 00:26:53,239
This is your fault, isn't it?

325
00:26:54,141 --> 00:26:54,952
Sort of.

326
00:26:55,072 --> 00:26:57,311
How are you gonna stop him
from getting on that plane?

327
00:26:57,591 --> 00:26:59,000
We have to destroy it.

328
00:27:06,551 --> 00:27:08,010
Why isn't she speaking English?

329
00:27:08,393 --> 00:27:10,781
She was hit on the head when
she was running away from Locke.

330
00:27:11,047 --> 00:27:12,447
He came back here?

331
00:27:13,015 --> 00:27:14,560
What... what did he want?

332
00:27:14,607 --> 00:27:18,488
What did he say to you?
You... you understand me?

333
00:27:52,778 --> 00:27:54,562
I don't think she wants to come.

334
00:28:09,109 --> 00:28:11,188
Miss. Paik would like to know
if there is a problem.

335
00:28:12,250 --> 00:28:15,378
I'm sorry. I'm showing
that your account was closed.

336
00:28:15,662 --> 00:28:17,609
The balance is zero.

337
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:29,390
If she may ask, who
closed the account, please?

338
00:28:30,242 --> 00:28:32,233
Looks like... her father.

339
00:28:32,353 --> 00:28:34,614
Mr. Woo Jung Paik had access.

340
00:28:34,734 --> 00:28:36,442
The funds were transferred

341
00:28:36,562 --> 00:28:39,983
to one of his other accounts
at our main branch in Seoul.

342
00:28:54,814 --> 00:28:57,387
- Uhh!
- Get in here.

343
00:29:00,453 --> 00:29:03,356
Let's get in.
Come on, get In.

344
00:29:05,586 --> 00:29:06,873
What's going on?

345
00:29:06,956 --> 00:29:08,676
I bumped his head on the door.

346
00:29:08,677 --> 00:29:11,578
Oh, come on Omar. You gotta
be more careful than that.

347
00:29:19,109 --> 00:29:20,755
I got this.

348
00:29:21,577 --> 00:29:23,508
And go get the Arab guy.

349
00:29:23,628 --> 00:29:25,849
Hey. I'm an Arab.

350
00:29:25,969 --> 00:29:27,734
Just go pick him up.

351
00:29:31,125 --> 00:29:32,759
Sorry about that.

352
00:29:33,393 --> 00:29:36,475
Omar's loyal, but he
lacks attention to detail.

353
00:29:37,729 --> 00:29:40,167
You don't really understand a word
I'm saying to you right now, do you?

354
00:29:40,287 --> 00:29:41,567
Nothin'?

355
00:29:41,851 --> 00:29:44,978
All right. Just hold still, okay?

356
00:29:47,686 --> 00:29:49,556
I'm gonna strap you in here.

357
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:52,244
Just in case you figure out
what's about to happen to you,

358
00:29:52,273 --> 00:29:54,674
I can't have you freaking out.

359
00:29:57,855 --> 00:30:00,144
I don't think you realize...

360
00:30:00,593 --> 00:30:03,660
how unhappy Mr. Paik was
when he found out that

361
00:30:03,710 --> 00:30:05,757
you were doing his little girl.

362
00:30:07,666 --> 00:30:09,805
Well, you know that 25 grand

363
00:30:10,374 --> 00:30:12,394
that you were supposed to deliver?

364
00:30:12,932 --> 00:30:15,847
That was my fee
for popping you.

365
00:30:17,358 --> 00:30:18,736
From what I hear, you know

366
00:30:19,079 --> 00:30:21,996
anyone who works for, Paik
knows the cardinal rule...

367
00:30:22,326 --> 00:30:24,150
hands off the boss' daughter.

368
00:30:25,781 --> 00:30:28,911
But you... you couldn't
resist her, could you?

369
00:30:34,444 --> 00:30:37,087
The heart wants
what the heart wants.

370
00:30:43,681 --> 00:30:45,061
Thank you.

371
00:30:50,188 --> 00:30:51,894
I'm sorry.

372
00:30:56,261 --> 00:30:58,819
Some people just aren't
meant to be together.

373
00:31:06,906 --> 00:31:08,567
What the hell
were you thinking?

374
00:31:08,687 --> 00:31:10,540
I'm sorry. I know.
I know we panicked.

375
00:31:10,573 --> 00:31:12,139
This was not supposed
to happen for days.

376
00:31:12,259 --> 00:31:13,600
We had a timetable.

377
00:31:13,647 --> 00:31:14,754
See, he was leaving their camp.

378
00:31:14,874 --> 00:31:17,225
Well, you should have let him leave
and taken him in the jungle.

379
00:31:17,345 --> 00:31:19,898
Well, maybe you should put
a mercenary in charge

380
00:31:19,940 --> 00:31:21,577
instead of a geophysicist.

381
00:31:26,383 --> 00:31:27,849
What's done is done.

382
00:31:27,969 --> 00:31:30,503
I need you to get the
package from the submarine

383
00:31:30,538 --> 00:31:32,145
and take it to the infirmary.

384
00:31:32,651 --> 00:31:34,401
Can you do that
for me please, Zoe?

385
00:31:34,686 --> 00:31:35,643
Yeah, sure.

386
00:31:40,359 --> 00:31:42,139
Mr. Kwon.

387
00:31:44,756 --> 00:31:47,178
My deepest apologies for everything
that's been done to you.

388
00:31:47,298 --> 00:31:48,869
- My name is...
- I know who you are.

389
00:31:49,191 --> 00:31:51,047
Why did you bring me here?

390
00:31:51,825 --> 00:31:53,411
We searched the Ajira plane,

391
00:31:53,531 --> 00:31:55,930
discovered your wife's luggage
and found this inside.

392
00:31:57,193 --> 00:32:00,568
I thought you might want
to have it. Go ahead.

393
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:02,162
Turn it on.

394
00:32:17,896 --> 00:32:19,661
Her name is, Ji Yeon.

395
00:32:20,604 --> 00:32:22,369
Your daughter.

396
00:32:29,601 --> 00:32:31,786
I understand you've never
seen her before.

397
00:32:45,751 --> 00:32:47,830
I have a daughter, too.

398
00:32:48,444 --> 00:32:50,973
I know what it's like
to be kept apart.

399
00:32:54,051 --> 00:32:56,804
I understand the one thing you want

400
00:32:56,821 --> 00:32:58,969
is to be reunited with
your wife and daughter.

401
00:33:00,535 --> 00:33:02,390
But it would be short-lived

402
00:33:02,719 --> 00:33:04,335
if that... thing

403
00:33:04,724 --> 00:33:07,326
masquerading as John Locke
ever got off this island.

404
00:33:07,446 --> 00:33:09,148
Your wife, your
daughter, my daughter...

405
00:33:09,539 --> 00:33:11,334
everyone we know and love...

406
00:33:12,822 --> 00:33:14,452
Would simply cease to be.

407
00:33:17,162 --> 00:33:19,456
I came here to make sure
that doesn't happen.

408
00:33:21,469 --> 00:33:22,458
How?

409
00:33:24,701 --> 00:33:25,883
Come with me.

410
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:28,630
I think it's time for
you to see the package.

411
00:33:29,875 --> 00:33:31,191
What package?

412
00:33:32,107 --> 00:33:33,648
It's not a "what."

413
00:33:36,386 --> 00:33:37,804
It's a "who."

414
00:34:21,879 --> 00:34:23,213
Who are you?

415
00:34:24,677 --> 00:34:26,481
No English.

416
00:34:27,235 --> 00:34:30,018
I don't know why you're here,
and I don't really care.

417
00:34:32,322 --> 00:34:33,954
No!

418
00:34:35,258 --> 00:34:36,460
Free.

419
00:34:37,424 --> 00:34:38,896
Free!

420
00:34:38,897 --> 00:34:39,964
Free.

421
00:34:59,041 --> 00:35:01,989
Good luck.

422
00:35:40,606 --> 00:35:41,773
Martin

423
00:35:42,292 --> 00:35:43,639
Martin?

424
00:35:43,759 --> 00:35:45,390
Who did this to you?

425
00:35:48,867 --> 00:35:51,157
Look behind you, you idiot.

426
00:37:14,734 --> 00:37:16,601
I brought you a couple of things.

427
00:37:19,078 --> 00:37:21,872
I was thinking about a patient
that I had during my residency.

428
00:37:24,068 --> 00:37:26,876
Car crash, banged his head.

429
00:37:28,113 --> 00:37:29,779
When he woke up,
he couldn't talk.

430
00:37:30,417 --> 00:37:32,815
The guy was frustrated. I mean...

431
00:37:33,162 --> 00:37:34,404
who wouldn't be?

432
00:37:36,020 --> 00:37:38,758
And then one of the nurses said,
"just because he can't speak

433
00:37:38,797 --> 00:37:40,107
doesn't mean
that he can't write."

434
00:37:43,109 --> 00:37:45,024
Think you could give it a try?

435
00:37:58,569 --> 00:38:01,113
It'll take a little longer
to get your point across,

436
00:38:01,532 --> 00:38:03,480
but at least you have
your voice back.

437
00:38:07,432 --> 00:38:09,976
I went back out to your garden
to see if he was there.

438
00:38:10,949 --> 00:38:12,822
He wasn't, but...

439
00:38:14,390 --> 00:38:15,692
then I found this.

440
00:38:25,875 --> 00:38:27,925
That's one stubborn tomato.

441
00:38:28,748 --> 00:38:31,112
Guess no one told it
it was supposed to die.

442
00:38:42,653 --> 00:38:44,153
Don't worry about it.

443
00:38:44,792 --> 00:38:47,257
You're not the first person
to tell me to leave them alone.

444
00:38:54,665 --> 00:38:56,242
Locke...

445
00:38:57,709 --> 00:38:59,714
What did he say to you?

446
00:39:07,775 --> 00:39:09,378
Why didn't you go with him?

447
00:39:18,806 --> 00:39:20,107
Do you trust me?

448
00:39:30,422 --> 00:39:31,504
Sun...

449
00:39:31,624 --> 00:39:33,893
come with us, and
I'll help you find Jin.

450
00:39:37,060 --> 00:39:39,080
I'll help you find him, and I'll
get you both on that plane

451
00:39:39,121 --> 00:39:41,636
and as far away from
this island as you can get.

452
00:39:45,036 --> 00:39:46,622
I promise.

453
00:40:10,167 --> 00:40:11,858
Where'd you go?

454
00:40:12,770 --> 00:40:13,922
What?

455
00:40:15,384 --> 00:40:17,194
Looked like your brain
took a little stroll.

456
00:40:19,693 --> 00:40:21,264
Why aren't you worried, James?

457
00:40:21,609 --> 00:40:22,926
I am worried.

458
00:40:24,676 --> 00:40:26,590
Just really good
at pretending I ain't.

459
00:40:28,984 --> 00:40:31,184
But I got a feeling
this is almost over.

460
00:40:31,631 --> 00:40:34,025
'Cause if Locke rode over there
on the boat with Sayid,

461
00:40:34,052 --> 00:40:36,498
then Charlie Widmore blew him
right out of the water.

462
00:40:37,145 --> 00:40:38,282
And what if he didn't?

463
00:40:38,639 --> 00:40:41,258
Well, then we're screwed
six ways from sun...

464
00:40:44,235 --> 00:40:45,732
Oh, hell.

465
00:40:46,607 --> 00:40:48,133
He's alone.

466
00:40:51,381 --> 00:40:53,371
Thought you went
over there to find Jin.

467
00:40:55,420 --> 00:40:57,351
They said they didn't have him.

468
00:40:57,471 --> 00:40:59,460
- And you believed that.
- No.

469
00:41:00,112 --> 00:41:02,643
Where's Sayid, Did
you lose him, too?

470
00:41:03,825 --> 00:41:04,829
When you over there, James,

471
00:41:04,878 --> 00:41:06,306
you mentioned that
Widmore had someone

472
00:41:06,355 --> 00:41:08,267
guarding a room
on his submarine...

473
00:41:08,656 --> 00:41:11,322
guarding something that
he didn't want you to see.

474
00:41:11,323 --> 00:41:12,480
Yeah, so?

475
00:41:13,816 --> 00:41:15,806
I don't like secrets.

476
00:41:28,271 --> 00:41:30,606
Okay, come on. All right.

477
00:41:30,607 --> 00:41:32,841
Hey, be careful with him.

478
00:41:34,780 --> 00:41:35,946
All right.

479
00:41:36,066 --> 00:41:38,512
Okay. The guy can hardly stand.

480
00:41:38,513 --> 00:41:40,117
Well, what do you expect?

481
00:41:44,252 --> 00:41:45,853
Oh!

482
00:41:51,161 --> 00:41:53,121
How much did you give him?

483
00:41:53,465 --> 00:41:55,026
Obviously, I gave him too much.

484
00:41:55,069 --> 00:41:56,262
But, we needed him
knocked out for the trip.

485
00:41:56,469 --> 00:41:57,662
I'm not a nurse.

486
00:41:58,487 --> 00:41:59,899
Come on. Get him up.

487
00:42:00,087 --> 00:42:02,499
Let's go Mr. Hume.

488
00:42:03,569 --> 00:42:05,202
Be careful.

489
00:42:05,684 --> 00:42:07,004
Come on.
