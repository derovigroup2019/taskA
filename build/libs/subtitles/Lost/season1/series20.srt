1
00:00:02,589 --> 00:00:04,619
People are talking about what we're doing out here every day.

2
00:00:04,691 --> 00:00:05,566
We're gonna have to tell 'em.

3
00:00:05,631 --> 00:00:07,685
They're not ready. I saw a beach craft.

4
00:00:07,742 --> 00:00:09,010
What is inside of it, John?

5
00:00:09,084 --> 00:00:11,048
You're gonna have to climb up there for us and find out.

6
00:00:11,131 --> 00:00:13,763
Anybody out there? Mayday. Mayday.

7
00:00:18,473 --> 00:00:19,221
Help!

8
00:00:20,424 --> 00:00:21,034
What happened?

9
00:00:21,110 --> 00:00:23,506
There was an accident. Boone fell off a cliff.

10
00:00:23,777 --> 00:00:25,360
Tell me exactly what happened.

11
00:00:25,630 --> 00:00:27,900
John? Locke!

12
00:00:29,170 --> 00:00:30,390
Come on, out of the way.

13
00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:32,670
I need room.

14
00:00:33,987 --> 00:00:34,735
Keep him steady.

15
00:00:34,807 --> 00:00:36,276
Boone, can you hear me? It's okay. We got you.

16
00:00:36,337 --> 00:00:37,541
- What happened?
- Fell down a cliff.

17
00:00:37,618 --> 00:00:39,482
- But he was with Locke.
- Keep him steady now.

18
00:00:39,778 --> 00:00:40,843
He's bleeding a lot.

19
00:00:40,909 --> 00:00:42,844
I know he's bleeding. Keep him steady, damn it.

20
00:00:42,907 --> 00:00:44,275
You gotta press harder than that, Kate.

21
00:00:44,335 --> 00:00:44,770
I'm trying.

22
00:00:44,868 --> 00:00:46,444
All right, slow now. Slow and gentle.

23
00:00:47,253 --> 00:00:47,970
Easy.

24
00:00:51,221 --> 00:00:53,586
Sun, a pair of scissors in the second drawer of the cart.

25
00:00:54,739 --> 00:00:55,830
Second drawer!

26
00:00:58,927 --> 00:01:00,268
Diapers in the first drawer.

27
00:01:00,556 --> 00:01:02,152
Sun's gonna switch places with you.

28
00:01:02,291 --> 00:01:03,940
- Sun, I need --
- Yes, I understand.

29
00:01:04,206 --> 00:01:06,121
Hurley, grab me that first-class seat from up there.

30
00:01:06,187 --> 00:01:08,798
I need that mesh. We need to create some sort of sterile --

31
00:01:08,988 --> 00:01:10,621
Hurley, I swear to god, if you faint!

32
00:01:10,703 --> 00:01:12,986
No. First-class, mesh. I'm cool.

33
00:01:13,556 --> 00:01:16,032
Get to the beach. Ransack Sawyer's stuff.

34
00:01:16,115 --> 00:01:18,368
I want his alcohol -- rubbing, scotch.

35
00:01:21,004 --> 00:01:22,772
Jack, what's going on?

36
00:01:23,703 --> 00:01:24,972
His lung just collapsed.

37
00:01:27,125 --> 00:01:28,122
Okay.

38
00:01:47,709 --> 00:01:49,764
Okay. Okay.

39
00:01:50,122 --> 00:01:51,126
Good, Boone.

40
00:01:52,053 --> 00:01:54,724
Good, Boone. That's good. Good job.

41
00:01:55,012 --> 00:01:58,719
All right, I'm gonna put a tube in that, and you're gonna be just fine.

42
00:02:00,593 --> 00:02:02,031
What are you still doing here?

43
00:02:02,921 --> 00:02:06,072
The alcohol, Kate! If you want him to live, get to the beach now!

44
00:02:21,191 --> 00:02:23,100
Damn it, just get the stupid clip-on, huh?

45
00:02:23,178 --> 00:02:25,774
You know why they call it a tie? 'Cause you gotta tie it.

46
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:28,472
You know why they call ita clip-on? 'Cause you clip it... on.

47
00:02:30,202 --> 00:02:31,339
You nervous, silverman?

48
00:02:31,512 --> 00:02:33,002
What the hell do I have to be nervous about?

49
00:02:33,115 --> 00:02:35,722
- It's a big responsibility.
- I can handle responsibility.

50
00:02:36,545 --> 00:02:38,890
Maybe. But I know that you don't like to get up in front of crowds.

51
00:02:38,952 --> 00:02:39,720
I'll be fine.

52
00:02:41,974 --> 00:02:43,836
After about eight beers, I'll be fine.

53
00:02:43,949 --> 00:02:46,131
- She'll bust you, man.
- I'll brush my teeth.

54
00:02:46,227 --> 00:02:47,232
She'll bust ya.

55
00:02:50,047 --> 00:02:51,584
You can still back out, Marty.

56
00:02:54,149 --> 00:02:54,789
Nah.

57
00:02:55,392 --> 00:02:58,962
It's just a stupid speech. I'll make you proud.

58
00:03:01,009 --> 00:03:02,653
Okay, groom's turn.

59
00:03:04,686 --> 00:03:06,180
You can still back out, Jack.

60
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:13,232
Oh, it hurts.

61
00:03:15,115 --> 00:03:18,433
It's a closed fracture, but I think I can set it.

62
00:03:18,608 --> 00:03:22,673
His chest -- the wound -- can you, uh, sew him?

63
00:03:23,494 --> 00:03:24,833
He's lost a lot of blood.

64
00:03:24,936 --> 00:03:26,708
I don't know how far Locke had to carry him.

65
00:03:28,479 --> 00:03:30,396
Boone, listen to me -- listen!

66
00:03:31,359 --> 00:03:32,780
You are not gonna die.

67
00:03:33,353 --> 00:03:34,889
I'm gonna fix this, okay?

68
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:39,179
I am gonna save you.

69
00:04:04,228 --> 00:04:06,138
Got to flip them, or they'll burn, Walt.

70
00:04:07,765 --> 00:04:08,790
Hey, mamacita.

71
00:04:10,659 --> 00:04:11,610
Want some fish?

72
00:04:12,988 --> 00:04:14,979
No, thanks. I'm not really hungry.

73
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:20,412
How long, do you think, till it's ready?

74
00:04:21,350 --> 00:04:23,469
Maybe a week. Maybe less.

75
00:04:26,259 --> 00:04:27,109
You okay?

76
00:04:28,153 --> 00:04:29,055
Yeah, I'm fine.

77
00:04:29,403 --> 00:04:30,657
All right, I'll see you guys later.

78
00:04:33,191 --> 00:04:34,159
She likes me.

79
00:04:36,266 --> 00:04:37,201
Hey, Jin!

80
00:04:37,749 --> 00:04:39,504
Jin, want some fish?

81
00:04:39,664 --> 00:04:41,619
Take a break. Eat some fish.

82
00:04:45,408 --> 00:04:48,404
Man's got what I call an overzealous work ethic.

83
00:04:48,502 --> 00:04:49,519
Try obsession.

84
00:04:50,289 --> 00:04:52,530
He wants off this island bad, man.

85
00:04:52,621 --> 00:04:54,169
Can't say I blame poor cato.

86
00:04:54,784 --> 00:04:57,624
His lady speaks english all this time, and he didn't have a clue?

87
00:04:58,085 --> 00:04:59,846
I'm surprised he didn't try to swim out of here.

88
00:05:00,288 --> 00:05:01,490
- Hell, I would--
- Sawyer!

89
00:05:02,012 --> 00:05:04,285
I need all your alcohol. Now!

90
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:08,960
How'd it happen?

91
00:05:09,462 --> 00:05:13,236
Locke said that he fell off a cliff while they were hunting boar.

92
00:05:13,353 --> 00:05:15,012
The boar they never seem to get.

93
00:05:16,825 --> 00:05:18,658
- Is that it?
- I'm afraid so.

94
00:05:18,759 --> 00:05:19,815
Do you need anything else?

95
00:05:20,456 --> 00:05:22,385
- I can come with you.
- Too many cooks already.

96
00:05:23,364 --> 00:05:24,387
But thanks.

97
00:05:28,152 --> 00:05:30,319
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

98
00:05:33,988 --> 00:05:35,601
I'm sorry.

99
00:05:47,871 --> 00:05:50,186
- He needs blood.
- What?

100
00:05:50,561 --> 00:05:51,389
B lood.

101
00:05:52,476 --> 00:05:53,386
Transfusion.

102
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:54,857
- How will you --
- I don't know.

103
00:05:55,573 --> 00:05:56,592
I'll figure it out...

104
00:06:01,242 --> 00:06:02,631
after I set the leg.

105
00:06:07,471 --> 00:06:08,282
Let me.

106
00:06:08,527 --> 00:06:09,341
No, it's okay.

107
00:06:09,449 --> 00:06:10,268
Let me.

108
00:06:12,581 --> 00:06:13,653
Get some air.

109
00:06:21,303 --> 00:06:22,253
How is he?

110
00:06:23,104 --> 00:06:24,045
Don't  know yet.

111
00:06:24,215 --> 00:06:25,648
Well, what happened out there? Where's Locke?

112
00:06:25,715 --> 00:06:26,535
I don't know.

113
00:06:27,174 --> 00:06:28,106
What, he just took off?

114
00:06:28,190 --> 00:06:31,184
Yeah, Charlie, he just took off.

115
00:06:31,270 --> 00:06:32,550
- Where's Shannon?
- I don't know.

116
00:06:32,623 --> 00:06:35,253
- Well, she's his sister --
- I don't know where she is!

117
00:06:39,847 --> 00:06:44,193
And here she is, the future mrs. Jack Shepard.

118
00:06:44,756 --> 00:06:45,565
Thank you.

119
00:06:46,154 --> 00:06:49,441
Wow, can I get another microphone?

120
00:06:49,502 --> 00:06:50,952
I think this one's been drinking.

121
00:06:54,828 --> 00:06:58,447
A little over two years ago, I blew a tire out,

122
00:06:58,975 --> 00:07:01,991
flipped over the center divider into oncoming traffic

123
00:07:02,344 --> 00:07:04,689
and was hit head-on by an S.U.V.

124
00:07:06,055 --> 00:07:07,536
My back was broken.

125
00:07:07,939 --> 00:07:11,242
They all said it was irreparable.

126
00:07:14,699 --> 00:07:16,675
And then there was Jack.

127
00:07:19,003 --> 00:07:22,031
And he promised that he would fix me

128
00:07:23,479 --> 00:07:26,623
because that's the kind of guy he is.

129
00:07:30,002 --> 00:07:33,357
Because you are the most committed man I have ever known.

130
00:07:35,691 --> 00:07:39,434
Because you fixed me,

131
00:07:40,985 --> 00:07:44,472
I will dance at our wedding.

132
00:07:48,272 --> 00:07:49,264
To Jack.

133
00:07:53,366 --> 00:07:55,819
My hero, Jack.

134
00:08:08,033 --> 00:08:11,295
Give him this for the pain.

135
00:08:12,847 --> 00:08:15,135
I think we're a little beyond herbal remedies here.

136
00:08:16,155 --> 00:08:18,064
It is not a remedy.

137
00:08:29,415 --> 00:08:30,879
Will you hold his shoulders?

138
00:08:42,677 --> 00:08:43,573
Here we go.

139
00:08:55,206 --> 00:08:56,052
Oh!

140
00:08:57,912 --> 00:08:59,268
Oh, no.

141
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:04,544
Come on.

142
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:34,086
Claire?

143
00:09:34,533 --> 00:09:35,629
What are you doing out here?

144
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:38,350
Nothing. Just leave me alone, please.

145
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:45,310
Oh, god.

146
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,340
You're having a baby.

147
00:09:54,322 --> 00:09:55,667
Claire, we need to get you back to camp.

148
00:09:55,766 --> 00:09:58,177
No, I'm fine. I just need to catch my breath.

149
00:09:58,274 --> 00:09:59,958
It's not okay. You're having your baby.

150
00:10:00,021 --> 00:10:02,413
No, I'm not, okay? It's just gas pains. It's fine.

151
00:10:02,484 --> 00:10:03,815
You're having contractions, Claire.

152
00:10:03,896 --> 00:10:05,863
No, I'm bloody not. Can you just leave me alone?

153
00:10:05,939 --> 00:10:08,305
I gotta get you to Jack. Please try to stand. Please.

154
00:10:08,371 --> 00:10:09,463
Look, I can't!

155
00:10:15,550 --> 00:10:16,389
Help!

156
00:10:18,811 --> 00:10:20,480
Somebody help!

157
00:10:22,413 --> 00:10:23,892
Help!

158
00:10:25,983 --> 00:10:27,403
Help!

159
00:10:29,148 --> 00:10:32,247
Somebody please help!

160
00:10:37,003 --> 00:10:38,606
Help!

161
00:10:39,068 --> 00:10:41,165
Help!

162
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:50,820
Please help! Somebody!

163
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:53,909
Help!

164
00:11:05,254 --> 00:11:10,984
Jin, I need you to go to the caves and get Jack, okay? You understand?

165
00:11:12,136 --> 00:11:13,497
We need Jack.

166
00:11:13,601 --> 00:11:15,101
Jack. Doctor.

167
00:11:15,193 --> 00:11:17,568
Yes. Yes, the doctor. Please come here.

168
00:11:19,027 --> 00:11:20,042
Don't leave me.

169
00:11:20,579 --> 00:11:22,027
Oh, no, no, honey. I won't.

170
00:11:22,299 --> 00:11:24,281
I'm not going anywhere, okay? I promise.

171
00:11:26,497 --> 00:11:28,489
Jack. Hurry.

172
00:11:30,367 --> 00:11:32,105
- Ask him again.
- He's in shock.

173
00:11:32,165 --> 00:11:33,922
That's why you need to ask him again.

174
00:11:37,951 --> 00:11:40,055
Boone, can you hear me?

175
00:11:40,362 --> 00:11:42,221
What is your blood type?

176
00:11:45,708 --> 00:11:48,432
Boone, please listen.

177
00:11:48,728 --> 00:11:50,305
What is your blood type?

178
00:11:50,367 --> 00:11:53,024
- Damn it.
- Maybe a smaller piece.

179
00:11:53,106 --> 00:11:55,338
Veins are like a wet noodle.

180
00:11:55,692 --> 00:11:57,120
First you have to find one,

181
00:11:57,197 --> 00:12:00,039
then you have to have a hollow needle sharp enough to actually pierce it.

182
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:01,350
I've got bamboo.

183
00:12:05,825 --> 00:12:08,589
None of it actually even matters because I don't know his blood type.

184
00:12:08,667 --> 00:12:11,774
- Not to mention that his injuries --
- A-negative.

185
00:12:14,539 --> 00:12:15,732
Boone, what'd you say?

186
00:12:15,909 --> 00:12:16,881
Shannon...

187
00:12:17,605 --> 00:12:19,172
Did you hear "a-negative"?

188
00:12:20,448 --> 00:12:23,995
Get Charlie, ask everyone you can find -- everyone -- what their blood type is.

189
00:12:24,093 --> 00:12:25,224
A-negative, okay?

190
00:12:26,663 --> 00:12:29,248
And find his sister. Find Shannon.

191
00:12:30,530 --> 00:12:31,466
Where are we going?

192
00:12:33,427 --> 00:12:34,189
This way.

193
00:12:34,958 --> 00:12:36,678
Oh, okay.

194
00:12:40,330 --> 00:12:41,353
Are you lost?

195
00:12:42,203 --> 00:12:44,015
No. Absolutely not.

196
00:12:46,084 --> 00:12:47,846
Those trees look really familiar.

197
00:12:49,498 --> 00:12:51,286
It's this way, I think.

198
00:12:53,011 --> 00:12:54,440
Did you just say, "I think"?

199
00:13:04,535 --> 00:13:05,499
Surprise.

200
00:13:10,466 --> 00:13:11,193
Damn  it!

201
00:13:12,729 --> 00:13:13,630
I found an "A."

202
00:13:14,275 --> 00:13:16,241
- Positive or negative?
- She doesn't know.

203
00:13:16,451 --> 00:13:20,143
I also found two B-positives and one AB-negative.

204
00:13:20,429 --> 00:13:21,648
At least, he thinks so.

205
00:13:22,262 --> 00:13:23,634
Did you find any O-negative?

206
00:13:23,722 --> 00:13:26,363
- Sun said A-negative.
- Where is she?

207
00:13:26,541 --> 00:13:28,262
We split up. I thought she'd be back here.

208
00:13:28,462 --> 00:13:29,906
So you only asked four people?

209
00:13:30,474 --> 00:13:33,521
I asked the whole sodding camp. No one knows their blood type.

210
00:13:33,609 --> 00:13:35,031
I don't know my bloody blood type.

211
00:13:35,385 --> 00:13:36,301
Did you find Shannon?

212
00:13:36,373 --> 00:13:39,404
No, I was getting you this.

213
00:13:45,513 --> 00:13:49,046
A hollow needle sharp enough to pierce a noodle.

214
00:13:56,188 --> 00:13:57,146
It's perfect.

215
00:13:57,872 --> 00:13:59,285
Not to rain on your proverbial parade,

216
00:13:59,387 --> 00:14:01,615
but I thought you said we needed someone who was A-negative?

217
00:14:01,706 --> 00:14:02,650
Or o-negative.

218
00:14:02,746 --> 00:14:04,708
Right, which judging by your tantrum, no one is.

219
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:05,655
Someone is.

220
00:14:06,899 --> 00:14:08,413
You? Why'd you make us --

221
00:14:08,476 --> 00:14:09,842
O-neg is the universal donor.

222
00:14:10,349 --> 00:14:12,490
It's in the ballpark, it's not a match.

223
00:14:13,421 --> 00:14:15,731
My blood could put himin to anaphylactic shock --

224
00:14:16,816 --> 00:14:17,861
stop his heart.

225
00:14:20,185 --> 00:14:21,260
You mean he'll die?

226
00:14:22,207 --> 00:14:23,467
He's not gonna die.

227
00:14:41,923 --> 00:14:44,035
Those girls are checking you out.

228
00:14:46,523 --> 00:14:50,163
- You're in your PJs.
- Indeed, I am.

229
00:14:52,852 --> 00:14:54,995
- Are they cute?
- Who?

230
00:14:55,418 --> 00:14:56,952
The girls that are checking me out.

231
00:14:57,854 --> 00:15:00,689
Mm, one of them's kinda cute,

232
00:15:01,087 --> 00:15:02,856
the other one's just trashy.

233
00:15:04,735 --> 00:15:07,479
- "Heart and soul"?
- You got it.

234
00:15:07,714 --> 00:15:10,193
- I'm taking the easy part.
- Of course.

235
00:15:18,453 --> 00:15:20,822
You know, you really don't have to do this if you don't want to.

236
00:15:23,108 --> 00:15:24,538
How do you know I haven't?

237
00:15:25,036 --> 00:15:27,822
Because you haven't.

238
00:15:28,210 --> 00:15:29,249
Oops, sorry.

239
00:15:31,478 --> 00:15:32,782
It was a silly idea.

240
00:15:32,843 --> 00:15:35,941
I just -- I read too many bridal magazines. I think it rotted my brain.

241
00:15:36,038 --> 00:15:38,527
Sarah, I want to. I'm going to.

242
00:15:38,624 --> 00:15:42,873
I just have to figure out the right way to say it.

243
00:15:44,195 --> 00:15:45,372
They're just vows.

244
00:15:46,694 --> 00:15:47,584
Just vows?

245
00:15:53,702 --> 00:15:54,455
Hey,

246
00:15:57,834 --> 00:15:58,767
he's gonna come.

247
00:15:59,032 --> 00:16:01,308
Yeah, I know.

248
00:16:04,326 --> 00:16:07,793
So, you stay down here as long as you need to.

249
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:12,078
And when you're ready, I'll be upstairs.

250
00:16:18,694 --> 00:16:22,134
I cannot wait to marry you, Jack Shepard.

251
00:16:34,125 --> 00:16:34,976
Jack.

252
00:16:35,578 --> 00:16:36,399
Jack.

253
00:16:36,916 --> 00:16:39,460
- Jack. Doctor. Jack.
- Jack.

254
00:17:02,858 --> 00:17:03,861
Claire.

255
00:17:04,150 --> 00:17:05,767
Claire? What about Claire?

256
00:17:07,855 --> 00:17:10,237
He says Claire's with Kate. She's in labor.

257
00:17:10,419 --> 00:17:12,346
Claire's having the baby? Where? Where?

258
00:17:16,587 --> 00:17:19,304
He says he thinks she's okay, but she's in pain.

259
00:17:19,397 --> 00:17:21,231
Does he know how fast the contractions are coming?

260
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:25,889
Every two minutes.

261
00:17:26,002 --> 00:17:26,907
Is she nauseous?

262
00:17:27,609 --> 00:17:28,259
Can she stand?

263
00:17:28,315 --> 00:17:29,985
Is there any bleeding? Did her water break?

264
00:17:32,302 --> 00:17:33,241
No, none of that.

265
00:17:34,046 --> 00:17:35,264
But she can't move.

266
00:17:35,503 --> 00:17:36,385
We should go.

267
00:17:36,540 --> 00:17:39,059
What do we need? Towels, bandages, hot water.

268
00:17:39,136 --> 00:17:40,389
How do we take hot water?

269
00:17:40,455 --> 00:17:41,602
I'm sure you'll figure all that out.

270
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:44,035
You tell Jin to take Charlie with him and go back to Claire.

271
00:17:44,577 --> 00:17:47,270
I can do that. That dilating thing, how do I look out for that?

272
00:17:47,353 --> 00:17:50,056
Listen to me. Tell Kate -- Charlie, look at me.

273
00:17:50,322 --> 00:17:51,260
Tell Kate

274
00:17:52,138 --> 00:17:56,072
to wait until the contractions are 60 seconds apart. You got that?

275
00:17:56,220 --> 00:17:58,785
Now, she's gonna need to make sure that Claire pushes,

276
00:17:59,032 --> 00:18:00,255
but not too hard, not too fast --

277
00:18:00,322 --> 00:18:04,458
just until the head is clear, and then as hard as she can.

278
00:18:04,683 --> 00:18:07,177
When the baby is out, you make sure she clears its nose

279
00:18:07,346 --> 00:18:08,432
and its mouth.

280
00:18:08,544 --> 00:18:10,203
Okay, but you'll be there by then, right?

281
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:12,286
No, I won't. I'm not going anywhere.

282
00:18:14,406 --> 00:18:15,600
I need to stay here.

283
00:18:16,316 --> 00:18:21,175
Now you tell Kate she's gonna have to deliver this baby.

284
00:18:31,144 --> 00:18:32,255
They've stopped.

285
00:18:34,683 --> 00:18:35,951
That happens, I think.

286
00:18:36,043 --> 00:18:37,616
No, no. They're not coming anymore.

287
00:18:37,887 --> 00:18:40,749
I'm fine. I'm okay. I'm okay, really.

288
00:18:40,815 --> 00:18:41,174
Claire --

289
00:18:41,241 --> 00:18:42,330
No, no, no. I'm okay, really.

290
00:18:42,397 --> 00:18:43,912
Claire, I don't thinkthat you should be doing --

291
00:18:46,166 --> 00:18:47,118
What is that?

292
00:18:47,775 --> 00:18:49,259
I think your water just broke.

293
00:18:49,745 --> 00:18:52,501
No, no, no. I can't have the baby!

294
00:18:52,603 --> 00:18:55,008
- Just hold on.
- I can't have the baby now!

295
00:18:55,051 --> 00:18:59,887
Just hold on. Jack's coming. Claire, he's coming.

296
00:19:19,313 --> 00:19:22,175
Screwed myself up pretty bad, huh?

297
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:25,397
Hey.

298
00:19:27,838 --> 00:19:29,646
My leg hurts.

299
00:19:29,989 --> 00:19:31,104
Don't try to move it.

300
00:19:32,021 --> 00:19:33,075
Can  you breathe okay?

301
00:19:33,270 --> 00:19:34,453
It fell on me.

302
00:19:35,650 --> 00:19:36,839
What fell?

303
00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:39,271
The plane. I was in the plane.

304
00:19:39,405 --> 00:19:43,768
Boone, Boone, Locke said you fell from a cliff.

305
00:19:44,499 --> 00:19:45,333
No.

306
00:19:46,592 --> 00:19:48,728
No. It fell.

307
00:19:49,819 --> 00:19:50,842
The plane.

308
00:19:51,825 --> 00:19:53,650
It's 'cause of the hatch.

309
00:19:54,001 --> 00:19:55,455
We found a hatch.

310
00:19:55,635 --> 00:19:57,381
Boone, Boone, stay with me, man.

311
00:19:57,427 --> 00:19:58,502
Hey, stay with me.

312
00:20:01,385 --> 00:20:02,480
Locke said --

313
00:20:03,643 --> 00:20:04,385
John --

314
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:06,111
John said...

315
00:20:06,935 --> 00:20:11,676
not to tell about the hatch.

316
00:20:12,105 --> 00:20:14,360
What did Locke do? What hatch?

317
00:20:14,718 --> 00:20:15,787
My leg hurts.

318
00:20:16,704 --> 00:20:18,966
Boone. Boone!

319
00:20:19,106 --> 00:20:19,959
Hey.

320
00:20:26,030 --> 00:20:27,324
Shannon.

321
00:20:27,976 --> 00:20:28,914
Shannon.

322
00:20:30,681 --> 00:20:31,489
Shannon.

323
00:20:31,808 --> 00:20:32,724
Shannon.

324
00:20:42,121 --> 00:20:43,718
I need to tell you something.

325
00:20:44,448 --> 00:20:45,417
All right.

326
00:20:50,025 --> 00:20:55,257
My brother -- Boone -- he's not really my brother.

327
00:20:56,027 --> 00:20:57,377
He's my stepbrother.

328
00:20:58,606 --> 00:21:01,679
Our parents got married when we were, like, 8 and 10.

329
00:21:04,632 --> 00:21:06,655
He's kind of in love with me.

330
00:21:09,568 --> 00:21:10,884
In love with you?

331
00:21:13,916 --> 00:21:16,637
And how do you feel towards him?

332
00:21:17,392 --> 00:21:20,269
I'll always feel something for him,

333
00:21:21,055 --> 00:21:23,351
but am I in love with him in that way?

334
00:21:24,053 --> 00:21:24,784
No.

335
00:21:25,758 --> 00:21:26,756
Not at all.

336
00:21:29,198 --> 00:21:33,346
We're here for god knows how long, and so is Boone.

337
00:21:36,101 --> 00:21:37,831
Maybe we should go back.

338
00:21:40,222 --> 00:21:41,774
I don't wanna go back.

339
00:21:42,445 --> 00:21:44,712
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

340
00:21:48,752 --> 00:21:49,831
I just...

341
00:21:50,917 --> 00:21:52,679
need to take it a little slow.

342
00:21:54,420 --> 00:21:55,915
Are you okay with that?

343
00:21:57,212 --> 00:21:59,198
I had no expectations.

344
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:05,141
Right.

345
00:22:06,452 --> 00:22:08,787
Hopes, not expectations.

346
00:22:13,073 --> 00:22:14,952
Oh, god, that hurts.

347
00:22:17,097 --> 00:22:17,875
Hello?

348
00:22:18,577 --> 00:22:19,729
Hey. Kate.

349
00:22:20,261 --> 00:22:21,813
Claire. Is she okay?

350
00:22:21,890 --> 00:22:23,291
- Where's Jack?
- He couldn't come.

351
00:22:23,348 --> 00:22:24,643
What do you mean he couldn't come? He has to come.

352
00:22:24,690 --> 00:22:27,839
Yeah, he's pouring his own blood into Boone's arm right now.

353
00:22:29,007 --> 00:22:30,383
Okay. Okay.

354
00:22:30,471 --> 00:22:32,017
We'll just have to pick her up and bring her to him.

355
00:22:32,088 --> 00:22:32,554
No, Kate.

356
00:22:32,637 --> 00:22:34,358
No, we have to get her to him before it's too late.

357
00:22:36,793 --> 00:22:37,495
Look...

358
00:22:38,058 --> 00:22:40,910
Jack said you have to deliver the baby.

359
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:41,519
What?

360
00:22:41,581 --> 00:22:43,712
Now he talked me through it, and it's relatively simple.

361
00:22:43,792 --> 00:22:46,082
- Charlie, I can't do this.
- Yes, you can. I have water --

362
00:22:46,173 --> 00:22:48,590
You're not listening to me. I can't deliver this baby.

363
00:22:48,671 --> 00:22:50,131
Well, somebody bloody has to.

364
00:22:59,624 --> 00:23:01,684
You know, I was out there for over a week.

365
00:23:02,092 --> 00:23:03,781
There are days I can't remember.

366
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:05,979
I mean, what if --

367
00:23:06,312 --> 00:23:08,297
what if they did something to the baby?

368
00:23:10,908 --> 00:23:12,604
God, I'm not ready for this.

369
00:23:12,916 --> 00:23:13,750
I'm not --

370
00:23:15,143 --> 00:23:17,146
I'm so scared.

371
00:23:18,171 --> 00:23:19,106
I'm scared.

372
00:23:20,607 --> 00:23:21,256
Hey...

373
00:23:22,999 --> 00:23:25,496
I'm -- I'm scared, too.

374
00:23:28,005 --> 00:23:29,848
But we're gonna get through this together.

375
00:23:32,784 --> 00:23:33,504
Okay?

376
00:23:44,651 --> 00:23:45,936
Come on, Boone.

377
00:23:57,861 --> 00:23:59,089
It's not working.

378
00:24:02,288 --> 00:24:04,265
Blood's not the problem. It's the leg.

379
00:24:05,049 --> 00:24:06,619
All the blood's pooling there.

380
00:24:07,347 --> 00:24:08,735
Compartment syndrome.

381
00:24:09,825 --> 00:24:11,731
He didn't get this injury from a fall.

382
00:24:12,487 --> 00:24:14,095
Something crushed his leg.

383
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:18,760
What are you doing?

384
00:24:19,420 --> 00:24:21,311
You've given him enough.

385
00:24:39,071 --> 00:24:39,803
Hurley.

386
00:24:41,370 --> 00:24:44,595
Whoa, dude. You all right, man? You're looking kinda goth.

387
00:24:45,035 --> 00:24:47,853
- Look, where's Michael?
- Beach, I think.

388
00:24:48,180 --> 00:24:49,731
I need you to go get him for me, okay?

389
00:24:49,819 --> 00:24:50,515
What for?

390
00:24:51,006 --> 00:24:51,861
Just get him.

391
00:25:06,826 --> 00:25:07,724
Hey, kiddo.

392
00:25:13,811 --> 00:25:14,512
Hey.

393
00:25:14,660 --> 00:25:15,710
How's the water?

394
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:19,366
Ah... it's fantastic.

395
00:25:22,770 --> 00:25:25,658
Screaming kid next to me in first class.

396
00:25:26,431 --> 00:25:27,845
How does that happen, huh?

397
00:25:36,504 --> 00:25:37,628
What you got there?

398
00:25:39,048 --> 00:25:42,365
Oh. Sarah wants us to write our own vows.

399
00:25:48,007 --> 00:25:51,996
"My heart skips beats at the sound of your voice.

400
00:25:52,174 --> 00:25:56,680
My skin... warms to the touch of your fingers.

401
00:25:56,778 --> 00:26:00,772
Where you go, I will go," et cetera, et cetera.

402
00:26:01,339 --> 00:26:03,085
This is -- this is very nice.

403
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:05,845
Ha ha. Those aren't my vows.

404
00:26:05,922 --> 00:26:08,349
Those are hers. I stole them out of the room.

405
00:26:11,892 --> 00:26:13,172
I can't write mine.

406
00:26:13,260 --> 00:26:15,267
Yeah, well, you're a doctor. You're not a writer.

407
00:26:15,875 --> 00:26:16,925
- Right.
- Right.

408
00:26:23,863 --> 00:26:26,453
Sarah is a beautiful girl.

409
00:26:26,879 --> 00:26:28,236
Hell yeah, she is.

410
00:26:30,213 --> 00:26:31,072
You love her?

411
00:26:33,828 --> 00:26:35,030
Absolutely.

412
00:26:35,907 --> 00:26:38,067
Then why are you sitting out here?

413
00:26:47,719 --> 00:26:50,451
What if I can't be the husband or the --

414
00:26:51,086 --> 00:26:52,847
or the father that I want to be?

415
00:26:56,611 --> 00:26:58,394
What if I asked her because --

416
00:27:01,833 --> 00:27:03,631
because I saved her life?

417
00:27:14,296 --> 00:27:15,853
Should I marry her, dad?

418
00:27:22,170 --> 00:27:26,966
Commitment is what makes you tick, Jack.

419
00:27:29,645 --> 00:27:31,161
The problem is

420
00:27:31,540 --> 00:27:33,762
you're just not good at letting go.

421
00:27:40,301 --> 00:27:41,667
So you're saying Locke lied?

422
00:27:41,754 --> 00:27:42,702
He didn't fall.

423
00:27:42,871 --> 00:27:45,227
His leg was pinned under something -- something heavy.

424
00:27:46,526 --> 00:27:49,239
Okay, Jack, wait. The cargo container.

425
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:52,486
We got to do this. What about the axe?

426
00:27:52,660 --> 00:27:53,832
Can't use the axe.

427
00:27:55,256 --> 00:27:56,413
What are you doing?

428
00:27:59,834 --> 00:28:01,620
His right leg is filling with blood.

429
00:28:02,179 --> 00:28:04,934
If I don't stop it, I won't be able to save him.

430
00:28:05,569 --> 00:28:07,764
- You don't mean --
- The leg is dead.

431
00:28:22,423 --> 00:28:23,861
There's no other choice.

432
00:28:28,639 --> 00:28:29,453
Claire...

433
00:28:30,379 --> 00:28:32,862
I think this is about the time you're supposed to start pushing, okay?

434
00:28:33,034 --> 00:28:35,668
So, uh, push.

435
00:28:37,211 --> 00:28:38,008
And...

436
00:28:38,848 --> 00:28:40,062
don't hold your breath, honey.

437
00:28:40,117 --> 00:28:41,710
You're not gonna be able to push if you hold --

438
00:28:42,924 --> 00:28:43,840
Claire?

439
00:28:44,633 --> 00:28:45,846
Claire, what are you doing?

440
00:28:48,730 --> 00:28:51,510
Oh, no, no, no, no, no. Claire, you need to push right now.

441
00:28:51,756 --> 00:28:53,367
Don't do this, Claire, okay?

442
00:28:53,466 --> 00:28:55,324
You can't stop this. This is happening.

443
00:28:55,411 --> 00:28:57,485
Your baby is coming, and I need your help.

444
00:29:00,522 --> 00:29:02,320
It's not going to want me.

445
00:29:03,861 --> 00:29:04,642
What?

446
00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:07,080
It knows I don't want it and I was gonna give it away.

447
00:29:07,177 --> 00:29:08,795
Babies know that stuff.

448
00:29:11,232 --> 00:29:14,882
Do you want this baby now? Hmm?

449
00:29:17,107 --> 00:29:20,080
Do you want it to be healthy and safe?

450
00:29:21,756 --> 00:29:22,583
Okay.

451
00:29:22,886 --> 00:29:24,554
Because your baby knows that, too.

452
00:29:25,404 --> 00:29:28,277
You're not alone in this. We are all here for you.

453
00:29:30,811 --> 00:29:32,439
This baby is all of ours.

454
00:29:34,555 --> 00:29:38,481
But I need you to push, okay?

455
00:29:39,583 --> 00:29:41,517
Okay? Okay.

456
00:29:42,019 --> 00:29:43,068
On the count of 3.

457
00:29:43,652 --> 00:29:44,543
Ready?

458
00:29:44,783 --> 00:29:48,351
1...2...3, push.

459
00:29:48,650 --> 00:29:49,407
Go ahead.

460
00:29:49,741 --> 00:29:51,031
Good. Push.

461
00:29:53,759 --> 00:29:54,736
Good, good.

462
00:29:56,879 --> 00:29:58,260
Yeah, that's good.

463
00:29:58,357 --> 00:30:00,505
- Yeah. Right.
- Push. Push.

464
00:30:00,551 --> 00:30:01,174
Okay.

465
00:30:14,304 --> 00:30:15,305
Jack.

466
00:30:28,223 --> 00:30:29,082
Let's go.

467
00:30:30,321 --> 00:30:31,049
Jack --

468
00:30:31,295 --> 00:30:32,734
On 3. 1...

469
00:30:32,969 --> 00:30:34,344
- Jack!
- 2...

470
00:30:34,986 --> 00:30:36,169
Why are you doing this?

471
00:30:37,710 --> 00:30:39,241
He's bleeding inside.

472
00:30:39,404 --> 00:30:40,659
You're not helping him!

473
00:30:40,977 --> 00:30:43,874
You can't save him, Jack! You just can't.

474
00:30:43,947 --> 00:30:45,677
Don't tell me what I can't do!

475
00:30:46,020 --> 00:30:49,501
Okay. 1, 2, 3, go. All right.

476
00:31:15,335 --> 00:31:17,058
You don't need to see this.

477
00:31:20,488 --> 00:31:23,755
If you need me, shout.

478
00:32:12,446 --> 00:32:14,720
In sickness, in health,

479
00:32:15,738 --> 00:32:18,114
in good times and bad...

480
00:32:20,408 --> 00:32:23,935
I risk it all because I love you.

481
00:32:24,714 --> 00:32:26,015
Thank you, Sarah.

482
00:32:26,116 --> 00:32:28,809
Jack has also prepared his vows.

483
00:32:29,209 --> 00:32:31,427
Jack, if you would, please.

484
00:32:44,334 --> 00:32:45,174
Jack?

485
00:32:49,664 --> 00:32:52,414
I didn't write any vows.

486
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:56,688
I've been trying to for a month, but...

487
00:32:58,266 --> 00:32:59,720
I couldn't, and...

488
00:33:01,538 --> 00:33:03,719
so I started to wonder why that was.

489
00:33:04,982 --> 00:33:08,978
And as time went on, it only got worse,

490
00:33:10,206 --> 00:33:11,357
because I'm --

491
00:33:13,427 --> 00:33:15,483
because I'm not good at letting go.

492
00:33:19,459 --> 00:33:22,196
Or maybe I'm afraid of what'll happen if I fail.

493
00:33:26,646 --> 00:33:28,054
But I know one thing.

494
00:33:29,524 --> 00:33:31,439
I would have never been able to write anything

495
00:33:31,582 --> 00:33:33,588
as beautiful as what you just said.

496
00:33:35,770 --> 00:33:38,832
And last night, Sarah, when you were talking about the accident,

497
00:33:40,306 --> 00:33:41,812
you got it all wrong.

498
00:33:44,546 --> 00:33:46,169
I didn't fix you.

499
00:33:51,771 --> 00:33:53,107
You fixed me.

500
00:33:56,485 --> 00:33:57,944
I love you, Sarah,

501
00:33:59,665 --> 00:34:01,267
and I always will.

502
00:34:26,884 --> 00:34:27,836
Wait.

503
00:34:32,680 --> 00:34:33,309
Wait.

504
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:36,273
I have to.

505
00:34:37,688 --> 00:34:38,558
If I don't --

506
00:34:38,628 --> 00:34:40,893
I'm all messed up inside.

507
00:34:42,561 --> 00:34:43,714
You know it.

508
00:34:45,700 --> 00:34:47,354
This is out best chance.

509
00:34:49,879 --> 00:34:51,526
There is no chance.

510
00:34:53,352 --> 00:34:54,184
Really.

511
00:34:56,129 --> 00:34:56,939
I mean...

512
00:34:58,162 --> 00:34:59,412
look where we are.

513
00:35:01,858 --> 00:35:03,519
I'm not gonna let you give up.

514
00:35:06,897 --> 00:35:08,689
I know you made...

515
00:35:10,467 --> 00:35:11,863
a promise.

516
00:35:14,961 --> 00:35:17,087
I'm letting you off the hook.

517
00:35:27,577 --> 00:35:29,473
Let me go, Jack.

518
00:35:54,570 --> 00:35:55,629
I'm sorry.

519
00:35:59,143 --> 00:36:00,145
Don't be.

520
00:36:05,275 --> 00:36:06,704
Relax, relax, relax. Breathe.

521
00:36:06,838 --> 00:36:07,631
Come on, breathe.

522
00:36:08,108 --> 00:36:09,567
Breathe. Okay.

523
00:36:09,915 --> 00:36:12,716
Okay. Ready? You got to do another one.

524
00:36:12,879 --> 00:36:14,421
I can see it's close. Go, go, go, go.

525
00:36:14,492 --> 00:36:17,864
Push. It's really -- I think it's close.

526
00:36:17,930 --> 00:36:21,491
Come on. That's it! Okay.

527
00:36:21,828 --> 00:36:24,444
I can see. I can see the top of its head.

528
00:36:24,538 --> 00:36:26,114
It's almost clear. Come on.

529
00:36:26,474 --> 00:36:28,004
I can see, I can see it. Okay.

530
00:36:28,996 --> 00:36:29,766
You're almost there.

531
00:36:29,862 --> 00:36:31,271
You're so close. You're so close.

532
00:36:31,353 --> 00:36:34,231
Ready? Ready? Come on. One more.

533
00:36:34,885 --> 00:36:38,321
Go, push! Push, push, push, push, push!

534
00:36:41,878 --> 00:36:43,640
Yeah, come on!

535
00:36:52,726 --> 00:36:54,382
You have a little boy.

536
00:37:09,918 --> 00:37:11,299
It's your baby.

537
00:37:22,305 --> 00:37:25,256
I have a son. I have a son.

538
00:37:32,373 --> 00:37:33,687
Shh, shh, shh.

539
00:38:03,104 --> 00:38:04,490
Tell Shannon...

540
00:38:13,974 --> 00:38:15,223
Tell Shannon...

541
00:38:18,217 --> 00:38:19,753
tell...I --

542
00:41:49,942 --> 00:41:51,499
A beautiful, healthy baby.

543
00:41:57,534 --> 00:41:58,717
