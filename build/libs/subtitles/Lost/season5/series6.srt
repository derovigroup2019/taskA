1
00:00:00,467 --> 00:00:01,933
Previously on "Lost"

2
00:00:02,033 --> 00:00:02,691
I'm here to tell you

3
00:00:02,791 --> 00:00:03,483
That the island won't

4
00:00:03,583 --> 00:00:05,884
Let you come alone.

5
00:00:05,984 --> 00:00:07,317
All of you have to go back.

6
00:00:07,417 --> 00:00:09,317
Is that what this is about?

7
00:00:09,417 --> 00:00:11,334
This is insane.
You guys are crazy.

8
00:00:11,434 --> 00:00:13,167
- Kate
- Jack, don't!

9
00:00:13,267 --> 00:00:16,134
- Sayid, where are you going?
- I don't want any part of this.

10
00:00:16,234 --> 00:00:18,501
It's Jin!

11
00:00:23,234 --> 00:00:27,334
- How do you know he's alive?!
- There's someone...

12
00:00:27,434 --> 00:00:29,301
Someone here in Los Angeles.

13
00:00:29,401 --> 00:00:30,617
Someone? Who?

14
00:00:30,717 --> 00:00:31,934
The same person that's gonna show us

15
00:00:32,034 --> 00:00:34,067
how to get back to the island.

16
00:01:17,134 --> 00:01:20,468
Help!

17
00:01:20,568 --> 00:01:23,967
Anyone!

18
00:01:26,301 --> 00:01:28,234
Help!

19
00:01:28,334 --> 00:01:30,933
Help, Jack!

20
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,768
Help! Anyone!

21
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:48,267
Help!

22
00:01:49,933 --> 00:01:51,401
Help!

23
00:01:53,833 --> 00:01:56,301
Help!

24
00:02:13,034 --> 00:02:15,234
Help!

25
00:02:18,833 --> 00:02:22,001
It's okay. You're okay.
Relax. Aah! Oh, God!

26
00:02:22,101 --> 00:02:24,635
Oh, God!

27
00:02:24,735 --> 00:02:26,468
Okay.

28
00:02:26,568 --> 00:02:27,967
- Oh, my God!
- We can stand.

29
00:02:28,067 --> 00:02:29,867
- What?
- We can stand.

30
00:02:32,601 --> 00:02:34,100
Oh, my God.

31
00:02:40,668 --> 00:02:43,067
It really happened.

32
00:02:46,668 --> 00:02:48,401
Kate.

33
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:05,700
Kate.

34
00:03:06,768 --> 00:03:08,734
Kate, can you hear me?

35
00:03:14,534 --> 00:03:16,101
Jack?

36
00:03:16,201 --> 00:03:17,634
Are you okay?

37
00:03:20,434 --> 00:03:21,701
Are we...?

38
00:03:21,801 --> 00:03:23,268
Yeah.

39
00:03:23,368 --> 00:03:24,800
We're back.

40
00:03:27,933 --> 00:03:29,567
What happened?

41
00:03:36,567 --> 00:03:39,567
46 hours earlier

42
00:03:53,501 --> 00:03:56,067
I thought I said all of them.

43
00:03:58,034 --> 00:04:01,134
This is all I could get
on such a short notice.

44
00:04:01,234 --> 00:04:04,867
Guess it'll have to do for now.

45
00:04:06,434 --> 00:04:10,601
All right. Let's get started.

46
00:04:20,434 --> 00:04:22,067
Shall we?

47
00:05:27,634 --> 00:05:29,134
What is this place?

48
00:05:29,234 --> 00:05:33,800
The Dharma Initiative
called it the Lamp Post.

49
00:05:35,933 --> 00:05:39,301
This is how they found the island.

50
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:06,500
Did you know about this place?

51
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,401
No.

52
00:06:08,501 --> 00:06:10,067
No, I didn't.

53
00:06:10,167 --> 00:06:12,101
Is he telling the truth?

54
00:06:12,201 --> 00:06:14,367
Probably not.

55
00:06:20,134 --> 00:06:22,734
Here we go.

56
00:06:22,834 --> 00:06:24,734
All right.

57
00:06:24,834 --> 00:06:28,267
I apologize if this is confusing, but...

58
00:06:28,367 --> 00:06:30,633
Let's pay attention, yes?

59
00:06:32,666 --> 00:06:36,600
The room we're standing in
was constructed years ago

60
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:40,800
over a unique pocket of
electromagnetic energy.

61
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:46,267
That energy connects to similar
pockets all over the world.

62
00:06:46,367 --> 00:06:48,267
The people who built this room, however,

63
00:06:48,367 --> 00:06:50,467
- were only interested in one.
- The island.

64
00:06:50,567 --> 00:06:53,267
Yes. the island.

65
00:06:53,367 --> 00:06:56,267
They'd gathered proof that it existed.

66
00:06:56,367 --> 00:06:59,301
They knew it was out there somewhere,

67
00:06:59,401 --> 00:07:02,301
but they just couldn't find it.

68
00:07:02,401 --> 00:07:07,500
Then a very clever
fellow built this pendulum

69
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:11,401
on the theoretical notion
that they should stop looking

70
00:07:11,501 --> 00:07:14,368
for where the island was supposed to be

71
00:07:14,468 --> 00:07:18,833
and start looking for
where it was going to be.

72
00:07:20,733 --> 00:07:24,234
What do you mean, "where
it was going to be"?

73
00:07:24,334 --> 00:07:25,878
Well, this fellow
presumed, and correctly,

74
00:07:25,978 --> 00:07:27,834
as it turned out,

75
00:07:27,934 --> 00:07:31,234
that the island was always moving.

76
00:07:31,334 --> 00:07:34,533
Why do you think you were never rescued?

77
00:07:34,633 --> 00:07:39,934
Now while the movements
of the island seem random,

78
00:07:40,034 --> 00:07:42,097
this man and his team

79
00:07:42,197 --> 00:07:44,600
created a series of equations

80
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:49,667
which tell us, with a
high degree of probability,

81
00:07:49,767 --> 00:07:55,733
Where it is going to be
at a certain point in time.

82
00:07:57,900 --> 00:08:04,034
Windows, as it were, that while
open, provide a route back.

83
00:08:04,134 --> 00:08:10,867
Unfortunately, these windows
don't stay open for very long.

84
00:08:10,967 --> 00:08:15,733
Yours closes in 36 hours.

85
00:08:19,367 --> 00:08:21,301
Um, I'm sorry. excuse me.

86
00:08:21,401 --> 00:08:23,533
Am I really hearing this?

87
00:08:23,633 --> 00:08:25,334
That's what this is about?

88
00:08:25,434 --> 00:08:27,734
You're all going back
to the island willingly?

89
00:08:27,834 --> 00:08:30,967
Yes. Why are you here, Desmond?

90
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:38,734
I came here to deliver a message.

91
00:08:38,834 --> 00:08:40,300
Daniel Faraday,

92
00:08:41,967 --> 00:08:45,234
your son, sent me here.

93
00:08:45,334 --> 00:08:47,234
He wanted me to tell you

94
00:08:47,334 --> 00:08:51,633
that he and all the people
on the island need your help.

95
00:08:51,733 --> 00:08:53,767
He said that only you could help them.

96
00:08:53,867 --> 00:08:56,267
He didn't say Jack. He didn't
say Sun. He didn't say Ben.

97
00:08:56,367 --> 00:08:59,467
- He said you.
- But I am helping, dear.

98
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,367
Consider the message delivered.

99
00:09:05,867 --> 00:09:07,734
I'm sorry to have to
tell you this, Desmond,

100
00:09:07,834 --> 00:09:09,700
but the island isn't done with you yet.

101
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:13,034
This woman cost me
four years of my life,

102
00:09:13,134 --> 00:09:15,967
four years that I'll never
get back because you told me

103
00:09:16,067 --> 00:09:18,800
that I was supposed to go to the island!

104
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:21,367
That it was my bloody purpose!

105
00:09:24,867 --> 00:09:28,700
You listen to me, brother,
and you listen carefully.

106
00:09:30,633 --> 00:09:33,034
These people
- they're just usin' us.

107
00:09:33,134 --> 00:09:35,067
They're playing some kind of game,

108
00:09:35,167 --> 00:09:37,034
and we are just the pieces.

109
00:09:37,134 --> 00:09:40,934
Whatever she tells you to do,

110
00:09:41,034 --> 00:09:42,367
ignore it.

111
00:09:46,933 --> 00:09:49,867
You say the island's not done with me?

112
00:09:49,967 --> 00:09:53,034
Well, I'm done with the island.

113
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:05,867
Jack...

114
00:10:05,967 --> 00:10:08,234
The binder in your hands

115
00:10:08,334 --> 00:10:11,867
shows all the air routes
that fly over the coordinates

116
00:10:11,967 --> 00:10:14,334
where I believe the island will be

117
00:10:14,434 --> 00:10:16,967
in little more than a day from now.

118
00:10:17,067 --> 00:10:21,301
There's a commercial airliner
flying from L.A. to Guam.

119
00:10:21,401 --> 00:10:26,401
It's going to go right
through your window.

120
00:10:26,501 --> 00:10:30,234
Ajira Airways, flight 316.

121
00:10:30,334 --> 00:10:33,567
If you have any hope of the
island bringing you back,

122
00:10:33,667 --> 00:10:36,800
it must be that plane.

123
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:39,533
You all need to be on it.

124
00:10:42,467 --> 00:10:45,167
It must be that flight.

125
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:53,001
If you want to return,

126
00:10:53,101 --> 00:10:56,167
You need to recreate as best you can

127
00:10:56,267 --> 00:11:00,150
the circumstances that brought
you there in the first place

128
00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:08,734
That means as many of the same people
as you are able to bring with you.

129
00:11:08,834 --> 00:11:12,101
And what if we can't get
anyone else to come with us?

130
00:11:12,201 --> 00:11:13,967
What if we're it?

131
00:11:14,067 --> 00:11:19,734
All I can tell you is the
result would be unpredictable.

132
00:11:19,834 --> 00:11:22,567
So that's it?

133
00:11:22,667 --> 00:11:24,567
We just get on that flight,

134
00:11:24,667 --> 00:11:27,067
and we just hope that it works?

135
00:11:27,167 --> 00:11:29,067
That's all?

136
00:11:29,167 --> 00:11:32,234
No, that's not all, Jack...

137
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:37,167
At least, not for you.

138
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,735
Come on in.

139
00:11:46,835 --> 00:11:49,949
Ben and Sun heard what
they needed to hear,

140
00:11:50,049 --> 00:11:53,868
and this does not concern them.

141
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:58,933
Oh. here we are.

142
00:12:07,667 --> 00:12:09,067
What's this?

143
00:12:09,167 --> 00:12:12,100
It's John Locke's suicide note.

144
00:12:14,401 --> 00:12:19,301
Uh... I, uh...

145
00:12:19,401 --> 00:12:20,934
I didn't know.

146
00:12:21,034 --> 00:12:22,934
Well, why would you?

147
00:12:23,034 --> 00:12:28,052
Obituaries don't see fit to mention
when people hang themselves, Jack.

148
00:12:34,484 --> 00:12:37,284
Why would he kill himself?

149
00:12:39,584 --> 00:12:42,251
There are many reasons, I'm sure,

150
00:12:42,351 --> 00:12:44,818
But the only one that matters is this:

151
00:12:44,918 --> 00:12:48,484
He is going to help you get back.

152
00:12:50,052 --> 00:12:51,985
John is going to be a proxy.

153
00:12:53,551 --> 00:12:54,818
A substitute.

154
00:12:54,918 --> 00:12:56,518
A substitute for who?

155
00:12:56,618 --> 00:12:58,752
Jack...

156
00:12:58,852 --> 00:13:01,518
Who do you think?

157
00:13:02,818 --> 00:13:05,218
You need to, as best you can,

158
00:13:05,318 --> 00:13:09,218
Recreate the conditions
of the original flight...

159
00:13:09,318 --> 00:13:12,651
Which is why you need to give
John something of your father's.

160
00:13:15,418 --> 00:13:19,019
You have to get something
that belonged to your father,

161
00:13:19,119 --> 00:13:21,418
And you need to give it to John.

162
00:13:21,518 --> 00:13:24,418
What?

163
00:13:24,518 --> 00:13:26,418
That's what you have to do.

164
00:13:29,484 --> 00:13:33,052
My father... is gone.

165
00:13:33,152 --> 00:13:35,518
My father has been dead for three years.

166
00:13:35,618 --> 00:13:37,485
You want me to...

167
00:13:37,585 --> 00:13:40,518
A-and to give it to
Locke?! He's in a coffin!

168
00:13:42,217 --> 00:13:44,085
This is ridiculous.

169
00:13:44,185 --> 00:13:51,118
Oh, stop thinking how ridiculous
it is and start asking yourself

170
00:13:51,218 --> 00:13:55,052
whether or not you
believe it's going to work.

171
00:13:57,484 --> 00:14:01,618
That's why it's called
a leap of faith, Jack.

172
00:14:27,518 --> 00:14:28,952
Where's Sun?

173
00:14:29,052 --> 00:14:31,618
She left.

174
00:14:31,718 --> 00:14:33,284
And Locke?

175
00:14:33,384 --> 00:14:36,251
I mean... his body? The coffin?

176
00:14:36,351 --> 00:14:38,951
I have a friend looking after it.

177
00:14:41,018 --> 00:14:43,818
I'll pick it up on
my way to the airport.

178
00:14:49,418 --> 00:14:53,318
- What did she say to you, Jack?
- Nothing that matters.

179
00:14:53,418 --> 00:14:55,385
Who is she?

180
00:14:55,485 --> 00:14:57,450
Why is she... helping us?

181
00:14:57,550 --> 00:14:58,851
How does she know all this?

182
00:15:03,152 --> 00:15:06,451
Thomas the apostle.

183
00:15:08,251 --> 00:15:10,652
When Jesus wanted to return to Judea,

184
00:15:10,752 --> 00:15:16,118
knowing that he would probably be
murdered there, Thomas said to the others,

185
00:15:16,218 --> 00:15:19,384
"Let us also go, that
we might die with him."

186
00:15:21,484 --> 00:15:24,318
But Thomas was not
remembered for this bravery.

187
00:15:24,418 --> 00:15:27,518
His claim to fame came later...

188
00:15:27,618 --> 00:15:30,885
when he refused to
acknowledge the resurrection.

189
00:15:30,985 --> 00:15:34,151
He just couldn't wrap
his mind around it.

190
00:15:34,251 --> 00:15:37,551
The story goes...

191
00:15:37,651 --> 00:15:43,418
that he needed to touch
Jesus' wounds to be convinced.

192
00:15:44,918 --> 00:15:47,385
So was he?

193
00:15:47,485 --> 00:15:49,118
Of course he was.

194
00:15:50,651 --> 00:15:53,685
We're all convinced
sooner or later, Jack.

195
00:16:02,818 --> 00:16:04,885
Where are you going?

196
00:16:04,985 --> 00:16:08,852
Oh, I made a promise to
an old friend of mine.

197
00:16:08,952 --> 00:16:11,351
Just a loose end that needs tying up.

198
00:16:13,451 --> 00:16:15,718
See you at the airport, Jack.

199
00:16:54,418 --> 00:16:56,985
Hello?

200
00:16:57,085 --> 00:16:59,551
Yeah, this is him.

201
00:17:01,184 --> 00:17:02,785
He did what?

202
00:17:02,885 --> 00:17:04,752
This is the fourth time he's left.

203
00:17:04,852 --> 00:17:08,602
He's gotta follow the rules, or he'll have
to move to our fully assisted facility.

204
00:17:08,702 --> 00:17:10,118
Yeah, I understand.

205
00:17:10,218 --> 00:17:17,251
And now, ladies and gentlemen,
here is my fraidy-cat rabbit!

206
00:17:20,718 --> 00:17:22,952
Hey, Ray.

207
00:17:23,052 --> 00:17:23,486
Hey, Jack.

208
00:17:23,487 --> 00:17:25,685
As for my next trick, I
need someone to pick a card.

209
00:17:25,785 --> 00:17:28,518
- Wanna get out of here?
- The sooner the better.

210
00:17:28,618 --> 00:17:33,052
Would you please pick
one? Look at it. Hm-hmm.

211
00:17:35,618 --> 00:17:38,918
You wanna tell me why you
took off this time, Ray?

212
00:17:39,018 --> 00:17:42,019
Do I really need to answer that?

213
00:17:42,119 --> 00:17:45,019
Will you at least tell me
where the bus was headed?

214
00:17:45,119 --> 00:17:45,300
Doesn't matter.

215
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:48,418
Anywhere I go is
somewhere better than here.

216
00:17:59,284 --> 00:18:01,718
- You packed a bag?
- Of course I did.

217
00:18:04,018 --> 00:18:08,184
One of these times, I'm
actually gonna get away.

218
00:18:08,284 --> 00:18:09,792
They won't ever find me either.

219
00:18:09,892 --> 00:18:12,885
Take off again, they're gonna
throw you outta here, Ray.

220
00:18:12,985 --> 00:18:15,685
But what would I do
without my magic shows?

221
00:18:19,052 --> 00:18:23,251
Let me help you unpack, granddad.

222
00:18:23,351 --> 00:18:25,551
So how are you, kiddo?

223
00:18:25,651 --> 00:18:27,151
You seeing anyone special?

224
00:18:27,251 --> 00:18:31,718
Whatever happened to the girl that
you brought by with you that time?

225
00:18:31,818 --> 00:18:33,685
The pretty one with all the freckles?

226
00:18:33,785 --> 00:18:35,885
What was her name?

227
00:18:35,985 --> 00:18:37,752
Kate.

228
00:18:37,852 --> 00:18:39,451
We're not together anymore.

229
00:18:40,918 --> 00:18:43,451
Well, look at the bright side:

230
00:18:43,551 --> 00:18:46,251
More time to come visit me.

231
00:18:46,351 --> 00:18:51,151
I'd love to, granddad.
I really would, but...

232
00:18:51,251 --> 00:18:55,918
I think I might be... might
be going away for a while.

233
00:18:56,018 --> 00:18:58,351
Where's "away" exactly?

234
00:18:58,451 --> 00:19:00,851
Somewhere better than here.

235
00:19:11,685 --> 00:19:13,351
Are these yours, granddad?

236
00:19:14,651 --> 00:19:16,251
No.

237
00:19:16,351 --> 00:19:18,384
Those were your father's.

238
00:19:24,351 --> 00:19:27,618
Your mom sent me a box of
his stuff after he died.

239
00:19:27,718 --> 00:19:32,200
Must've got mixed in when I
packed for a quick getaway.

240
00:19:37,601 --> 00:19:41,134
These shoes...

241
00:19:41,234 --> 00:19:42,834
can I take them?

242
00:19:42,934 --> 00:19:45,134
Be my guest.

243
00:21:08,801 --> 00:21:10,200
Kate?

244
00:21:13,367 --> 00:21:15,534
What are you doing here?

245
00:21:15,634 --> 00:21:18,000
Are you still going back to the island?

246
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:20,668
Yeah.

247
00:21:20,768 --> 00:21:22,734
Yeah, I think I am.

248
00:21:27,467 --> 00:21:29,568
Then I'm going with you.

249
00:21:29,668 --> 00:21:31,934
Kate...

250
00:21:32,034 --> 00:21:35,933
- What happened? Where's Aaron?
Where--? - No, don't ask questions.

251
00:21:39,933 --> 00:21:46,267
If you want me to go with you, you'll
never ask me that question again.

252
00:21:46,367 --> 00:21:48,768
You will never ask me about Aaron.

253
00:21:48,868 --> 00:21:50,801
Do you understand, Jack?

254
00:21:50,901 --> 00:21:53,434
Yes.

255
00:21:55,667 --> 00:21:56,900
Thank you.

256
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,900
Morning.

257
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,534
Morning.

258
00:22:27,634 --> 00:22:31,067
Uh, I made you some coffee,
and there's orange juice.

259
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:40,334
You still like milk and two sugars?

260
00:22:40,434 --> 00:22:43,400
Yeah, sure.

261
00:22:50,933 --> 00:22:54,200
Those don't make much
sense for the island.

262
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:58,800
You might want to consider hiking boots.

263
00:23:00,467 --> 00:23:03,301
Those were my father's.

264
00:23:03,401 --> 00:23:08,201
When I went to pick up his body in
Sydney, my dad didn't have any nice shoes.

265
00:23:08,301 --> 00:23:12,184
My mother wanted to have the funeral
as soon as I landed back in L.A.

266
00:23:12,284 --> 00:23:15,067
but I thought, who the
hell's gonna see his feet?

267
00:23:15,167 --> 00:23:21,833
And so I
- I had these old white tennis shoes, and I just said, "Use these.  Put these on him."

268
00:23:23,733 --> 00:23:26,633
'Cause he wasn't worth a
nice pair of shoes to me.

269
00:23:26,733 --> 00:23:30,301
Or the time it would take
to go out and get 'em.

270
00:23:30,401 --> 00:23:32,633
So why don't you get rid of 'em?

271
00:23:34,334 --> 00:23:37,267
Why hold on to something
that makes you feel sad?

272
00:23:46,833 --> 00:23:47,900
Go ahead.

273
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,367
I...

274
00:23:49,467 --> 00:23:52,167
I'll see you at the airport, okay?

275
00:24:00,467 --> 00:24:03,101
- Hello?
- Hello, Jack. Are you there?

276
00:24:03,201 --> 00:24:06,067
Yeah. Yeah, what's u,
is everything all right?

277
00:24:06,167 --> 00:24:09,234
Listen, we don't have much time.
I've been, uh... sidetracked,

278
00:24:09,334 --> 00:24:13,867
and I need you to pick up Locke's
body and take it to the airport.

279
00:24:13,967 --> 00:24:19,700
The coffin is at Simon's butcher
shop, corner of Grand and Hayes.

280
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:21,667
Why? Wh
- what's happened to you?

281
00:24:21,767 --> 00:24:23,700
Just do it. please.

282
00:24:45,601 --> 00:24:47,900
Are you Jill? Ben sent me.

283
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:51,200
I know who you are, Dr.
Shephard. Come on in.

284
00:24:58,833 --> 00:25:01,834
What's in the bag?

285
00:25:01,934 --> 00:25:04,000
Sorry.

286
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:06,167
Ben said to give you the van.

287
00:25:06,267 --> 00:25:09,300
I gotta pull it around back.
Give me about five minutes.

288
00:26:20,300 --> 00:26:23,800
Wherever you are, John...

289
00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:29,000
You must be laughing your ass
off that I'm actually doing this.

290
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:37,400
Because this... This is
even crazier than you are.

291
00:26:46,067 --> 00:26:47,767
And here.

292
00:26:47,867 --> 00:26:50,234
You can have that back.

293
00:26:50,334 --> 00:26:53,468
I've already heard everything
you had to say, John.

294
00:26:53,568 --> 00:26:56,534
You wanted me to go
back. I'm going back.

295
00:27:09,766 --> 00:27:12,000
Rest in peace.

296
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,933
Mr. Shephard, if you'll
just bear with me.

297
00:27:17,033 --> 00:27:19,666
The reason for transporting
Mr. Bentham to Guam?

298
00:27:19,766 --> 00:27:21,633
Uh, it was his--
these were his wishes.

299
00:27:21,733 --> 00:27:24,234
He wanted to be buried there.

300
00:27:24,334 --> 00:27:26,900
Who will be the recipient
of the deceased upon arrival?

301
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,416
Is there a
funeral home or--?

302
00:27:28,516 --> 00:27:29,466
No, it's me. me. I'll
be escorting the body.

303
00:27:29,566 --> 00:27:31,933
And your relation to the deceased?

304
00:27:32,033 --> 00:27:33,900
He was, uh, a friend.

305
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,700
Now, Mr. Shephard,
I have to inform you that

306
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:38,867
due to the increased security
measures, we are required

307
00:27:38,967 --> 00:27:40,766
to open the casket and
perform a screening.

308
00:27:40,866 --> 00:27:43,234
I assure you
it's all done with care.

309
00:27:43,334 --> 00:27:46,499
Do you understand, Mr. Shephard?

310
00:27:46,599 --> 00:27:47,967
Mr. Shephard?

311
00:27:48,067 --> 00:27:50,000
Yes. Yes, I understand.

312
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:52,466
Then please sign here.

313
00:27:56,633 --> 00:28:00,067
Thank you for flying Ajira Air.

314
00:28:00,167 --> 00:28:01,466
My condolences.

315
00:28:03,233 --> 00:28:06,234
I'm sorry you lost your friend.

316
00:28:06,334 --> 00:28:07,966
Thank you.

317
00:28:12,532 --> 00:28:15,900
Please remove all jackets,
sweaters, jewelry and footwear.

318
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:20,867
Remove all laptops and electronic
devices from their cases and place them...

319
00:28:20,967 --> 00:28:23,166
Jack.

320
00:28:24,866 --> 00:28:26,499
Sun. Hey.

321
00:28:26,599 --> 00:28:29,100
You're surprised to see me?

322
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:30,566
I just...

323
00:28:30,666 --> 00:28:33,000
I thought maybe you
might change your mind.

324
00:28:33,100 --> 00:28:38,100
If there's even a chance that Jin
is alive, I have to be on that plane.

325
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:43,000
All passengers, please have your tickets
and identification available for security.

326
00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:45,233
Please remove all Jackets, sweaters...

327
00:28:47,233 --> 00:28:51,566
...all laptops and electronic devices
from their cases and place them in a bin.

328
00:28:59,532 --> 00:29:04,333
This is the preliminary boarding
announcement for Ajira Airways flight 316,

329
00:29:04,433 --> 00:29:07,300
with service to Honolulu and
Guam, departing from gate 15.

330
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:11,766
For those of you on the standby list,
we'll have plenty of seats available.

331
00:29:11,866 --> 00:29:17,433
We would like to invite
our pre-board, first class

332
00:29:14,300 --> 00:29:17,433
and skyclub passengers to
board the aircraft at this time.

333
00:29:17,533 --> 00:29:19,449
What do you mean, "standby"?
There's no standbys.

334
00:29:19,549 --> 00:29:23,566
Oh, no, sir. You don't need to
worry. There are... 78 seats open.

335
00:29:23,666 --> 00:29:26,000
No. I bought those seats, all 78 of 'em.

336
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:29,033
I'm Hugo Reyes. They're
not open. They're mine.

337
00:29:29,133 --> 00:29:31,166
Check and see.

338
00:29:32,833 --> 00:29:34,433
Yes, I see that.

339
00:29:34,533 --> 00:29:38,300
Sir, these people just want
to get to their destination.

340
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:41,100
Why would you not want
them to be able to travel?

341
00:29:43,066 --> 00:29:44,682
You know, it doesn't matter why.

342
00:29:44,782 --> 00:29:47,267
They can take the next plane.

343
00:29:48,933 --> 00:29:50,133
Hurley.

344
00:29:52,499 --> 00:29:55,867
What are you doing here?
How did you know about the--?

345
00:29:55,967 --> 00:29:58,833
All that matters is
that I'm here, right?

346
00:30:02,733 --> 00:30:05,200
I'm glad that you're here, man.

347
00:30:12,033 --> 00:30:15,967
Okay, then.

348
00:30:16,067 --> 00:30:18,000
Let's do this.

349
00:30:20,799 --> 00:30:22,599
After you.

350
00:30:29,666 --> 00:30:31,167
Welcome to Ajira Air.

351
00:30:31,267 --> 00:30:34,234
Thank you, sir. Row 8, on your left.

352
00:30:34,334 --> 00:30:36,733
Welcome aboard.

353
00:30:38,166 --> 00:30:40,566
Yes, ma'am. You may. Thank you.

354
00:30:40,666 --> 00:30:43,167
Yes, make sure you put your...

355
00:30:43,267 --> 00:30:44,833
I will.

356
00:30:47,066 --> 00:30:48,300
Absolutely.

357
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:50,432
You made it.

358
00:30:54,100 --> 00:30:55,633
Yeah.

359
00:30:55,733 --> 00:30:57,333
I made it.

360
00:31:20,866 --> 00:31:23,366
- That should be everybody.
- Hold up! Wait, please!

361
00:31:23,466 --> 00:31:26,600
Thank you for not closing it.

362
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:30,033
- Oh, that's okay. Go right on in.
- Thanks.

363
00:31:34,699 --> 00:31:37,766
Wait! What's he doing here?!

364
00:31:37,866 --> 00:31:40,399
- Hurley, hey-- -
No, no! He can't come!

365
00:31:40,499 --> 00:31:43,300
If you want to get back, this
is how it's gonna have to be.

366
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:45,849
No one told me he was gonna be here.

367
00:31:45,949 --> 00:31:48,399
Who told you to be here, Hugo?

368
00:31:48,499 --> 00:31:50,433
Is everything okay?

369
00:31:50,533 --> 00:31:53,100
Yes. Yes, everything's fine.

370
00:31:54,079 --> 00:31:56,533
- Right?
- Yes, Jack. I'll be fine.

371
00:31:56,633 --> 00:31:59,000
Are you Jack Shephard, seat 8c?

372
00:31:59,100 --> 00:32:01,000
Yes.

373
00:32:01,100 --> 00:32:03,000
Security found this while
screening your cargo.

374
00:32:04,866 --> 00:32:09,699
Now if you two don't mind taking your seats,
we are gonna be pushing back for takeoff.

375
00:32:13,033 --> 00:32:14,633
What's that, Jack?

376
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:18,500
Nothing.

377
00:32:23,066 --> 00:32:25,267
And the other people
on this plane--

378
00:32:25,367 --> 00:32:27,234
What's gonna happen to them?

379
00:32:27,334 --> 00:32:28,499
Who cares?

380
00:33:43,966 --> 00:33:46,267
It's pretty crazy, huh?

381
00:33:46,367 --> 00:33:49,234
Which part?

382
00:33:49,334 --> 00:33:51,433
Hurley, Sayid...

383
00:33:51,533 --> 00:33:55,700
Being... on the same plane.

384
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:57,967
How did they end up here?

385
00:33:58,067 --> 00:33:59,699
They bought a ticket.

386
00:34:02,166 --> 00:34:04,700
You don't think that it means something?

387
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:06,533
That somehow...

388
00:34:06,633 --> 00:34:08,399
We're all back together?

389
00:34:08,499 --> 00:34:11,300
We're on the same plane, Jack.

390
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:13,733
Doesn't make us together.

391
00:34:13,833 --> 00:34:16,600
Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen,

392
00:34:16,700 --> 00:34:18,800
and welcome to Ajira Air.

393
00:34:18,900 --> 00:34:22,499
This is your captain, Frank J. Lapidus,

394
00:34:22,599 --> 00:34:24,700
and on behalf of the entire
flight crew, welcome aboard.

395
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:28,800
Currently we're right on schedule,
flying at a very comfortable 30,000 feet.

396
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:31,433
So sit back, relax and
enjoy the in-flight movie.

397
00:34:31,533 --> 00:34:33,633
- Excuse me, ma'am?
- Mr. Shephard, can I help you?

398
00:34:33,733 --> 00:34:35,633
Um, I need to talk to the pilot.

399
00:34:35,733 --> 00:34:37,856
Frank Lapidus and I are old friends,

400
00:34:37,857 --> 00:34:40,782
and if you could just tell him I'm
onboard, I'd really appreciate it.

401
00:34:40,882 --> 00:34:42,435
All right, but you
just have to go sit down

402
00:34:42,436 --> 00:34:44,823
because you can't be near the
cockpit door when it's open.

403
00:34:44,824 --> 00:34:45,215
Sure.

404
00:34:45,315 --> 00:34:46,115
I understand.

405
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:53,700
Captain, I have a passenger
named Jack Shephard.

406
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:57,133
He says he knows you. okay, sir.

407
00:35:00,432 --> 00:35:03,100
Well, hello, doc.

408
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:04,633
Small world.

409
00:35:06,066 --> 00:35:08,433
What are you doing going to Guam?

410
00:35:08,533 --> 00:35:10,766
What are you doing here, Frank?

411
00:35:10,866 --> 00:35:13,766
Well, I picked this gig
up about eight months ago.

412
00:35:13,866 --> 00:35:15,766
I fly this route all the time.

413
00:35:15,866 --> 00:35:18,933
Sometimes I take the big
birds into New... Delhi.

414
00:35:19,033 --> 00:35:23,300
Is... that Sayid?

415
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:25,367
And Hurley.

416
00:35:29,766 --> 00:35:31,333
Wait a second.

417
00:35:33,566 --> 00:35:35,933
We're not going to Guam, are we?

418
00:35:50,300 --> 00:35:51,967
How can you read?

419
00:35:52,067 --> 00:35:54,466
My mother taught me.

420
00:35:59,599 --> 00:36:03,466
I can read, Jack, because
it beats what you're doing.

421
00:36:03,566 --> 00:36:04,339
What's that?

422
00:36:04,340 --> 00:36:06,399
Waiting for something to happen.

423
00:36:10,432 --> 00:36:12,350
And what is gonna happen?

424
00:36:12,450 --> 00:36:14,133
You tell me, Jack.

425
00:36:14,233 --> 00:36:17,300
You're the one that got to stay
after school with Ms. Hawking.

426
00:36:23,432 --> 00:36:25,866
Did you know that Locke killed himself?

427
00:36:27,766 --> 00:36:30,267
No. No, I didn't.

428
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:42,733
They found this stuffed in his pocket.

429
00:36:42,833 --> 00:36:45,499
And I've been trying to get rid of it,

430
00:36:45,599 --> 00:36:50,800
but it's like it's... following me.

431
00:36:50,900 --> 00:36:53,100
I know it sounds crazy, but...

432
00:36:55,166 --> 00:36:58,599
it feels like John needs me to read it.

433
00:37:01,300 --> 00:37:03,100
Why don't you then?

434
00:37:08,966 --> 00:37:10,867
Is it because you're afraid?

435
00:37:10,967 --> 00:37:12,900
Afraid of what?

436
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:17,866
Afraid that he blames you, that
it's your fault he killed himself.

437
00:37:20,666 --> 00:37:22,300
Was it my fault?

438
00:37:24,399 --> 00:37:26,799
No, Jack, it wasn't your fault.

439
00:37:31,233 --> 00:37:34,033
Let me give you some privacy.

440
00:38:47,699 --> 00:38:49,700
Dude...

441
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:52,399
You might wanna fasten your seat belt.

442
00:38:53,833 --> 00:38:56,167
Fasten your seat belt, ma'am. Sir?

443
00:38:56,267 --> 00:38:58,799
Please put on your seat
belts. Seat belt, please.

444
00:39:35,333 --> 00:39:39,300
Help!

445
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:41,533
Anyone!

446
00:39:41,633 --> 00:39:42,766
Help!

447
00:40:00,100 --> 00:40:02,432
Kate.

448
00:40:08,133 --> 00:40:09,733
Kate.

449
00:40:15,499 --> 00:40:18,367
What happened?

450
00:40:24,532 --> 00:40:27,633
- Can you get up?
- Yeah.

451
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,733
The plane...

452
00:40:35,833 --> 00:40:38,499
Where's the plane?

453
00:40:38,599 --> 00:40:39,766
I don't know.

454
00:40:39,866 --> 00:40:42,133
After that light, I...

455
00:40:42,233 --> 00:40:44,133
I woke up in the jungle.

456
00:40:44,233 --> 00:40:46,366
So this is it? It's just us?

457
00:40:46,466 --> 00:40:47,900
I'm not sure.

458
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,666
Do either of you remember crashing?

459
00:40:50,766 --> 00:40:51,381
Crashing? No.

460
00:40:51,382 --> 00:40:55,833
One second, I'm being tossed around.
The next thing I know, I'm in the lagoon.

461
00:40:55,933 --> 00:40:58,267
Where's Sun and Sayid?

462
00:41:00,166 --> 00:41:02,133
Where's Ben?

463
00:41:02,233 --> 00:41:05,433
All right. Let's spread out,
search the jungle.

464
00:41:05,533 --> 00:41:09,233
We come across anybody
from the plane, we'll--

465
00:41:20,133 --> 00:41:21,100
Dude...

466
00:41:33,766 --> 00:41:35,133
Jin?
