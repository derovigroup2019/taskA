Previously on <i>Lost:</i>

2
00:00:03,291 --> 00:00:04,291
Are you one of them?

3
00:00:04,372 --> 00:00:05,822
- One of who?
- A hostile.

4
00:00:05,930 --> 00:00:07,430
- What's your name?
- Ben.

5
00:00:07,778 --> 00:00:08,778
Take me with you.

6
00:00:09,316 --> 00:00:11,516
If that's what you really want, Ben.
If that's what you want.

7
00:00:11,908 --> 00:00:13,208
I want you to think about that.

8
00:00:14,164 --> 00:00:17,864
And you're gonna have to be
very, very patient.

9
00:00:18,154 --> 00:00:21,022
You wanna protect your friends
or not, Sayid?

10
00:00:22,658 --> 00:00:25,126
I'm Sayid Jarrah,
one of the Oceanic Six.

11
00:00:37,673 --> 00:00:39,774
Stop right there!

12
00:00:42,378 --> 00:00:43,845
Sayid?

13
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:45,248
Jin.

14
00:00:45,882 --> 00:00:48,450
Shut up! Get down.

15
00:00:49,285 --> 00:00:51,920
Say another word,
and you're dead.

16
00:00:52,054 --> 00:00:55,190
I brought you a sandwich.
Are you a hostile?

17
00:00:55,224 --> 00:00:57,692
- Do you think I am?
- What's your name?

18
00:00:57,727 --> 00:00:59,127
Sayid.

19
00:00:59,161 --> 00:01:01,029
I'm Ben.

20
00:01:02,698 --> 00:01:05,633
It's nice to meet you, Ben.

21
00:03:26,308 --> 00:03:27,609
Hey, Phil.

22
00:03:27,643 --> 00:03:29,310
Hey.

23
00:03:29,345 --> 00:03:32,547
I brought another sandwich for him.

24
00:03:32,581 --> 00:03:34,115
Chicken salad this time.

25
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:36,451
Yeah, I don't think
it's the menu.

26
00:03:36,485 --> 00:03:38,786
He's not eating.
Save yourself the trouble, kid.

27
00:03:38,821 --> 00:03:40,822
But Horace told me to.

28
00:03:40,856 --> 00:03:43,291
Why does he care so much?
The guy's a hostile.

29
00:03:43,325 --> 00:03:46,628
- That doesn't mean he's not hungry.
- Whatever.

30
00:03:53,435 --> 00:03:55,236
I brought you a sandwich.

31
00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:03,311
And a book.

32
00:04:03,345 --> 00:04:05,346
I read it twice.

33
00:04:05,381 --> 00:04:06,481
It's good.

34
00:04:06,515 --> 00:04:08,816
Thank you.

35
00:04:08,851 --> 00:04:11,419
Did Richard send you?

36
00:04:14,156 --> 00:04:15,857
Richard.

37
00:04:15,891 --> 00:04:17,559
He's your leader, right?

38
00:04:20,629 --> 00:04:23,431
It's just a camera.

39
00:04:23,465 --> 00:04:26,067
They can see,
but they can't hear.

40
00:04:28,037 --> 00:04:30,438
Four years ago,
I ran away into the jungle,

41
00:04:30,472 --> 00:04:32,106
and Richard found me.

42
00:04:32,141 --> 00:04:34,108
I said I wanted to leave,

43
00:04:34,143 --> 00:04:37,178
that I wanted to join you.

44
00:04:37,213 --> 00:04:39,681
So I've been patient.

45
00:04:41,417 --> 00:04:45,053
And if you're patient, too,

46
00:04:45,087 --> 00:04:47,088
I think I can help you.

47
00:04:54,114 --> 00:04:56,914
Lost SO5E10:
"He's Our You"

48
00:06:23,171 --> 00:06:24,705
How'd it go?

49
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:27,508
He tried to bribe me.

50
00:06:27,542 --> 00:06:30,311
- It didn't work.
- Of course it didn't.

51
00:06:30,345 --> 00:06:32,546
Where to now?

52
00:06:32,581 --> 00:06:34,882
Nowhere.

53
00:06:34,917 --> 00:06:37,184
- You're done.
- What do you mean, I'm done?

54
00:06:37,219 --> 00:06:38,753
<i>We're</i> done.

55
00:06:38,787 --> 00:06:40,821
Andropov was the last one.

56
00:06:40,856 --> 00:06:42,823
You've taken care of everyone

57
00:06:42,858 --> 00:06:45,493
who posed a threat to your friends.

58
00:06:45,527 --> 00:06:48,362
It's been a pleasure
working with you, Sayid.

59
00:06:49,865 --> 00:06:52,733
So that's it?

60
00:06:52,768 --> 00:06:55,803
I killed all those people for you,

61
00:06:55,837 --> 00:06:58,539
and now you're just...
w- walking away?

62
00:06:58,573 --> 00:07:00,975
You didn't kill them
for <i>me,</i> Sayid.

63
00:07:01,009 --> 00:07:03,444
<i>You're</i> the one
that asked for their names.

64
00:07:05,013 --> 00:07:07,481
There's no one else
in Widmore's organization

65
00:07:07,516 --> 00:07:10,051
that we need to go after.

66
00:07:10,085 --> 00:07:11,686
Congratulations.

67
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:14,322
Mission accomplished.

68
00:07:14,356 --> 00:07:16,324
What do I do now?

69
00:07:18,026 --> 00:07:20,494
I suppose you should
go live your life.

70
00:07:20,529 --> 00:07:22,964
You're free, Sayid.

71
00:07:45,087 --> 00:07:46,887
Put out your hands.

72
00:07:48,457 --> 00:07:50,424
Come on.

73
00:08:03,805 --> 00:08:04,972
Thank you.

74
00:08:05,007 --> 00:08:07,875
It's nice to finally
hear your voice.

75
00:08:09,378 --> 00:08:10,612
I'm Horace.

76
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:17,418
Now's the part
where you tell me <i>your</i> name.

77
00:08:19,488 --> 00:08:23,791
I need you to tell me what you
were doing out in that jungle.

78
00:08:23,825 --> 00:08:27,795
- Ask him about the model. I-
- Radzinsky. I got this.

79
00:08:31,166 --> 00:08:32,933
Those handcuffs-

80
00:08:32,968 --> 00:08:37,671
Are you having some kind
of problem with your people?

81
00:08:37,706 --> 00:08:40,574
Because either you were
in some kind of disagreement,

82
00:08:40,609 --> 00:08:43,010
which makes me wanna help you,

83
00:08:43,045 --> 00:08:45,246
or you're a spy
trying to infiltrate us.

84
00:08:47,182 --> 00:08:49,116
So which is it?

85
00:08:58,226 --> 00:08:59,894
Okay.

86
00:09:02,464 --> 00:09:04,832
I'm gonna give you
an hour to decide

87
00:09:04,866 --> 00:09:07,601
whether you wanna talk to me.

88
00:09:07,636 --> 00:09:10,838
But if you decide
you don't want to...

89
00:09:10,872 --> 00:09:14,742
then I'm gonna have to take this
to the next level.

90
00:09:35,997 --> 00:09:38,199
I think your bacon's ready.

91
00:09:38,233 --> 00:09:39,533
Oh.

92
00:09:39,568 --> 00:09:41,335
I forgot.

93
00:09:41,369 --> 00:09:43,871
What's on the TV?

94
00:09:52,781 --> 00:09:55,649
It's over, isn't it?

95
00:09:55,684 --> 00:09:57,351
What's over?

96
00:09:57,385 --> 00:09:59,186
This.

97
00:09:59,221 --> 00:10:01,388
Us... playing house.

98
00:10:01,423 --> 00:10:03,090
All of it.

99
00:10:05,060 --> 00:10:07,595
I never actually thought
they'd come back.

100
00:10:07,629 --> 00:10:09,930
So they're back.
Nothing's changed.

101
00:10:09,965 --> 00:10:12,433
What if Sayid tells them
who he is?

102
00:10:12,467 --> 00:10:14,502
Sayid ain't sayin' nothin'.

103
00:10:16,538 --> 00:10:18,772
Hey.

104
00:10:18,807 --> 00:10:21,842
I got this under control.

105
00:10:28,650 --> 00:10:29,950
Morning, H.

106
00:10:29,985 --> 00:10:31,452
- Jim.
- What's up?

107
00:10:31,486 --> 00:10:33,420
- Juliet.
- Horace.

108
00:10:33,455 --> 00:10:36,590
I just spoke to the prisoner.
We have a problem.

109
00:10:39,361 --> 00:10:43,130
- Why? What'd he say?
- Nothing, which is what worries me.

110
00:10:43,165 --> 00:10:45,766
We need to find out
why he violated the truce,

111
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:48,402
why the hell he would
come into our territory.

112
00:10:48,436 --> 00:10:51,338
I'm just gonna have to have
Oldham do his thing on him.

113
00:10:53,675 --> 00:10:55,643
That psychopath? No way!

114
00:10:55,677 --> 00:10:59,113
What choice do I have?

115
00:10:59,147 --> 00:11:01,882
Just let me
have go at him alone.

116
00:11:01,917 --> 00:11:04,451
Be my guest,
but I'm telling you, man,

117
00:11:04,452 --> 00:11:06,387
he is not gonna talk.

118
00:11:06,421 --> 00:11:08,822
Oh, he'll talk to <i>me. </i>

119
00:11:12,227 --> 00:11:14,728
- Mr. LaFleur.
- Take your lunch, Phil.

120
00:11:16,198 --> 00:11:18,132
You going back there alone?

121
00:11:18,166 --> 00:11:20,267
Take your lunch, Phil.

122
00:11:20,302 --> 00:11:22,203
Yes, sir.

123
00:11:28,944 --> 00:11:30,544
How you doing?

124
00:11:30,579 --> 00:11:32,546
A 12-year-old Ben Linus

125
00:11:32,581 --> 00:11:35,115
brought me
a chicken salad sandwich.

126
00:11:35,150 --> 00:11:38,419
- How do you <i>think</i> I'm doing?
- Sweet kid, huh?

127
00:11:38,453 --> 00:11:40,721
How can you live with him here?

128
00:11:40,755 --> 00:11:43,591
'cause I ain't got a choice.

129
00:11:43,625 --> 00:11:46,493
Is that so?

130
00:11:46,528 --> 00:11:50,064
Let's see how <i>you</i> feel after
3 years of living in the '70s.

131
00:11:50,098 --> 00:11:52,566
Lucky for you...

132
00:11:52,601 --> 00:11:53,849
I spent that time getting myself

133
00:11:53,850 --> 00:11:55,603
in a position to save your ass.

134
00:11:58,173 --> 00:12:01,008
I'm sorry, Sayid.

135
00:12:08,283 --> 00:12:11,252
- What are you doing?
- When I tell them I got your confession,

136
00:12:11,286 --> 00:12:13,335
I need them to believe that
you didn't give it up easy.

137
00:12:13,336 --> 00:12:13,921
What confession?

138
00:12:13,955 --> 00:12:16,156
We're gonna say
you were trying to defect.

139
00:12:16,191 --> 00:12:18,892
You were gonna offer
some intel on the others

140
00:12:18,927 --> 00:12:20,000
In exchange for living with us.

141
00:12:20,001 --> 00:12:21,695
And why in God's name
would I want to do that?

142
00:12:21,730 --> 00:12:23,688
What the hell else
am I supposed to do with you?

143
00:12:23,789 --> 00:12:24,665
Let me go.

144
00:12:24,699 --> 00:12:27,301
And <i>then</i> what?
I can't just let you go.

145
00:12:27,335 --> 00:12:28,502
Why not?

146
00:12:28,536 --> 00:12:32,373
Because these people
trust me.

147
00:12:32,407 --> 00:12:34,508
I've built a life here,
and a pretty good one.

148
00:12:34,542 --> 00:12:37,778
I let you go,
all that goes away.

149
00:12:37,812 --> 00:12:40,281
So you got yourself
a choice, chief.

150
00:12:40,315 --> 00:12:42,950
Either you cooperate and join
the party in Dharmaville,

151
00:12:42,984 --> 00:12:44,985
or you're on your own.

152
00:12:48,356 --> 00:12:51,692
Then I guess I'm on my own.

153
00:12:54,064 --> 00:12:56,832
Fresh off the griddle.

154
00:12:56,867 --> 00:12:58,602
And don't forget
to try the dipping sauces.

155
00:12:58,736 --> 00:13:00,204
They really
bring out the ham.

156
00:13:00,338 --> 00:13:01,939
Thanks, Hurley.

157
00:13:03,373 --> 00:13:05,008
So...

158
00:13:05,442 --> 00:13:07,277
What's going on with Sayid?

159
00:13:07,411 --> 00:13:08,351
Don't know anything yet.

160
00:13:08,452 --> 00:13:09,813
What do you mean,
you don't know anything?

161
00:13:09,947 --> 00:13:11,449
I thought you were
at Sawyer's last night.

162
00:13:11,583 --> 00:13:12,793
What did he tell you?

163
00:13:12,894 --> 00:13:14,785
He told me to leave him
alone and let him do his job.

164
00:13:15,719 --> 00:13:17,553
And you're going to?

165
00:13:17,588 --> 00:13:20,189
I'll talk to Juliet,
see what she can tell me.

166
00:13:20,224 --> 00:13:23,125
Well, if Sawyer didn't tell you
anything, why would Juliet?

167
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:25,628
- Well, why wouldn't she?
- 'Cause they're together.

168
00:13:25,963 --> 00:13:29,165
- What do you mean, they're together?
- "Together" as...

169
00:13:29,399 --> 00:13:31,867
They live together.
Like, not as roommates.

170
00:13:31,902 --> 00:13:34,370
You know, "together"
like you guys were.

171
00:13:36,140 --> 00:13:37,875
I thought
it was kind of obvious.

172
00:13:38,009 --> 00:13:40,744
- I mean, who couldn't see that comin'?
- Hurley.

173
00:13:46,416 --> 00:13:51,454
Well, I guess I better...
Go make some more waffles.

174
00:13:54,491 --> 00:13:56,425
Did <i>you</i> know?

175
00:13:58,662 --> 00:14:00,596
Yeah.

176
00:14:00,631 --> 00:14:02,598
Hmm.

177
00:14:24,188 --> 00:14:27,323
You know what I can't figure out?

178
00:14:27,557 --> 00:14:30,192
Is how the hell you got caught.

179
00:14:30,227 --> 00:14:33,462
You hostiles are supposed
to be the kings of the jungle.

180
00:14:33,497 --> 00:14:36,399
And how dumb are you that you
got captured by these idiots?

181
00:14:37,934 --> 00:14:41,470
And yet <i>you're</i> the one
who mops up after them.

182
00:14:41,505 --> 00:14:44,573
Yeah, well...

183
00:14:44,574 --> 00:14:48,077
We'll see how cute you are once
Oldham gets done with you, pal.

184
00:14:56,053 --> 00:14:58,554
What the hell
are you doing here?

185
00:14:58,588 --> 00:15:00,990
I was bringing you a sandwich.

186
00:15:01,024 --> 00:15:02,291
A sandwich?

187
00:15:04,394 --> 00:15:06,962
You never made me a sandwich
in your life.

188
00:15:06,997 --> 00:15:09,765
Yeah, well...
I- I made one for myself...

189
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:11,701
Uh-huh.

190
00:15:11,735 --> 00:15:13,153
So... So I just thought
that I'd bring you-

191
00:15:13,154 --> 00:15:14,036
Oh, yeah? You just...

192
00:15:14,071 --> 00:15:16,672
- Dad, don't!
- Don't you lie to me.

193
00:15:18,075 --> 00:15:20,142
What are you doin' down here?

194
00:15:22,979 --> 00:15:25,881
You made this sandwich for <i>him,</i>
didn't you?

195
00:15:25,916 --> 00:15:27,917
- Hmm?
- Yes.

196
00:15:28,051 --> 00:15:30,153
- Who told you to do that?
- Nobody.

197
00:15:30,287 --> 00:15:32,255
- Nobody?
- I just thought that-

198
00:15:32,389 --> 00:15:35,525
You "just thought," huh?

199
00:15:35,659 --> 00:15:37,126
Go home.

200
00:15:38,495 --> 00:15:40,496
Go on. I'll tell you
what to think.

201
00:16:22,706 --> 00:16:24,574
How did you find me?

202
00:16:24,608 --> 00:16:27,176
I looked.

203
00:16:27,211 --> 00:16:29,478
What do you want, Ben?

204
00:16:29,513 --> 00:16:32,081
John Locke is dead.

205
00:16:34,117 --> 00:16:36,919
I think he was murdered.

206
00:16:36,954 --> 00:16:39,689
Why would anyone kill him?

207
00:16:39,723 --> 00:16:41,691
I'd say it was retribution

208
00:16:41,725 --> 00:16:44,827
for the work
you and I have been doing.

209
00:16:44,861 --> 00:16:46,829
So you're in danger, Sayid.

210
00:16:46,863 --> 00:16:50,132
If I can find you, so can
the people that found Locke.

211
00:16:50,167 --> 00:16:53,102
The same people who,
even as we speak,

212
00:16:53,136 --> 00:16:55,905
are sitting outside
Hugo's mental institution.

213
00:16:55,939 --> 00:16:57,907
They're watching him?

214
00:16:57,941 --> 00:17:01,110
A man in a sedan
has been there all week,

215
00:17:01,144 --> 00:17:04,614
just waiting...

216
00:17:04,648 --> 00:17:07,617
presumably for you or me
to show our faces.

217
00:17:07,651 --> 00:17:10,620
And that's why you're here?

218
00:17:10,654 --> 00:17:14,056
You actually came all this way
to suggest that I kill this man?

219
00:17:14,091 --> 00:17:16,158
You don't <i>want</i> to?

220
00:17:16,193 --> 00:17:19,395
What makes you think I <i>want</i> to?

221
00:17:19,429 --> 00:17:21,797
Because, Sayid...

222
00:17:21,832 --> 00:17:23,799
to put it simply,

223
00:17:23,834 --> 00:17:26,602
you're capable of things
that most other men aren't.

224
00:17:26,637 --> 00:17:28,571
Every choice
you've made in your life,

225
00:17:28,605 --> 00:17:31,040
whether it was
to murder or to torture,

226
00:17:31,074 --> 00:17:34,310
it hasn't really
been a choice at all, has it?

227
00:17:34,344 --> 00:17:36,746
It's in your nature.
It's what you are.

228
00:17:38,682 --> 00:17:41,183
You're a killer, Sayid.

229
00:17:48,692 --> 00:17:51,494
I'm not what you think I am.

230
00:17:52,996 --> 00:17:55,765
I don't like killing.

231
00:17:55,799 --> 00:17:59,168
Well, then I apologize.

232
00:17:59,202 --> 00:18:01,170
I was mistaken about you.

233
00:18:21,925 --> 00:18:24,427
All right, last chance.

234
00:18:38,408 --> 00:18:40,776
Take him to Oldham.

235
00:19:03,834 --> 00:19:06,335
<i>WOMAN: # I can't give you #</i>

236
00:19:06,370 --> 00:19:09,038
<i># anything #</i>

237
00:19:09,072 --> 00:19:11,474
<i># but love #</i>

238
00:19:11,508 --> 00:19:14,276
<i># baby #</i>

239
00:19:14,311 --> 00:19:17,346
<i># that's the only thing #</i>

240
00:19:17,381 --> 00:19:19,949
<i># I've plenty of #</i>

241
00:19:19,983 --> 00:19:21,283
Oldham.

242
00:19:21,318 --> 00:19:22,618
<i># baby #</i>

243
00:19:22,652 --> 00:19:25,354
Hey, man.
Are we ready?

244
00:19:25,389 --> 00:19:28,457
<i># dream a while,</i>
<i>scheme a while #</i>

245
00:19:28,492 --> 00:19:32,995
<i># you're sure to find #</i>

246
00:19:33,029 --> 00:19:35,598
<i># happiness #</i>

247
00:19:35,632 --> 00:19:37,099
<i># and I guess- #</i>

248
00:19:41,304 --> 00:19:43,739
Who is that man?

249
00:19:46,977 --> 00:19:49,912
He's our <i>you. </i>

250
00:20:01,124 --> 00:20:04,026
Better put him
in the restraints.

251
00:20:27,651 --> 00:20:30,719
They're for your protection.

252
00:20:30,754 --> 00:20:33,923
There are side effects
to what I'm giving you.

253
00:20:35,425 --> 00:20:37,193
Open his mouth.

254
00:20:39,830 --> 00:20:41,797
Open up.

255
00:20:52,809 --> 00:20:54,977
Don't be afraid.

256
00:20:55,011 --> 00:20:57,980
Just turn your mind off.
Let it take effect.

257
00:21:03,053 --> 00:21:04,620
It's beyond your control,

258
00:21:04,654 --> 00:21:07,690
so fighting it is
a poor use of your energies.

259
00:21:07,724 --> 00:21:10,359
You see,

260
00:21:10,393 --> 00:21:14,597
whether you struggle or not,
one thing's for sure, friend.

261
00:21:16,333 --> 00:21:19,336
You <i>will</i> tell us the truth.

262
00:21:28,301 --> 00:21:32,238
There's somebody-
somebody here in Los Angeles.

263
00:21:32,272 --> 00:21:34,640
- Let me take you to them.
- Who?

264
00:21:34,675 --> 00:21:37,009
The same person
that's gonna show us

265
00:21:37,044 --> 00:21:39,879
- how to get back to the island.
- Is that what this is about?

266
00:21:42,382 --> 00:21:44,583
This is insane.
You are all crazy.

267
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:49,389
Sayid, where are you going?

268
00:21:50,023 --> 00:21:52,124
I don't want any part of this.

269
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:54,360
And if I see <i>you</i> again,

270
00:21:54,394 --> 00:21:57,596
it'll be extremely unpleasant
for us both.

271
00:22:06,940 --> 00:22:09,141
Do you have a menu?

272
00:22:09,176 --> 00:22:11,143
There you go.

273
00:22:11,178 --> 00:22:13,112
Sir? Another MacCutcheon?

274
00:22:13,146 --> 00:22:14,947
Please.

275
00:22:16,983 --> 00:22:18,918
What's that run you?

276
00:22:18,952 --> 00:22:20,419
Excuse me?

277
00:22:20,454 --> 00:22:22,321
That scotch.

278
00:22:22,355 --> 00:22:24,290
What's a glass of that run you?

279
00:22:26,193 --> 00:22:29,028
Whatever it is, it's worth it.

280
00:22:29,062 --> 00:22:30,696
I don't understand

281
00:22:30,731 --> 00:22:34,333
why someone would pay 120 bucks
for a glass of anything.

282
00:22:36,937 --> 00:22:40,539
If you knew what my drink cost,
why did you ask me?

283
00:22:45,178 --> 00:22:50,816
Same reason I'm eating my dinner
here instead of a table.

284
00:22:50,851 --> 00:22:53,252
I'll have the rib eye,
bloody.

285
00:22:53,286 --> 00:22:55,221
Yes, ma'am.
Rib eye, bloody.

286
00:22:59,126 --> 00:23:01,660
Are you a professional?

287
00:23:01,695 --> 00:23:04,263
A professional what?

288
00:23:04,297 --> 00:23:06,532
You think I'm a prostitute?

289
00:23:06,566 --> 00:23:09,335
Mm.

290
00:23:09,369 --> 00:23:12,238
I'm not a professional anything.
I just...

291
00:23:12,272 --> 00:23:14,907
Thought you looked sad.

292
00:23:14,941 --> 00:23:16,709
I like sad men.

293
00:23:16,743 --> 00:23:19,245
I'm sorry to hear that.

294
00:23:26,019 --> 00:23:27,486
So...

295
00:23:29,322 --> 00:23:31,357
Other than drinking alone at bars...

296
00:23:32,759 --> 00:23:34,960
what do you do?

297
00:23:34,995 --> 00:23:36,595
For a living.

298
00:23:36,630 --> 00:23:38,864
I'm between jobs
at the moment.

299
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:42,401
So what <i>did</i> you do?

300
00:23:42,435 --> 00:23:46,005
The only thing
I was ever good at.

301
00:23:46,039 --> 00:23:48,841
Then why did you quit?

302
00:23:48,875 --> 00:23:51,577
I'm trying to change.

303
00:23:55,048 --> 00:23:56,982
I know why you're sad now.

304
00:23:57,017 --> 00:23:59,018
Do you?

305
00:23:59,052 --> 00:24:01,987
When you are that good
at something,

306
00:24:02,022 --> 00:24:04,356
there are always going to be people

307
00:24:04,391 --> 00:24:07,793
who tempt you into staying the same.

308
00:24:12,265 --> 00:24:15,701
And how do you know so much
about temptation?

309
00:24:16,136 --> 00:24:21,907
Buy me a glass of that scotch,
and I'll tell you.

310
00:24:38,227 --> 00:24:40,181
Hello there.

311
00:24:40,731 --> 00:24:42,196
Hello?

312
00:24:46,733 --> 00:24:49,268
I'm going to ask you
a few questions.

313
00:24:49,302 --> 00:24:53,639
I want you to relax
and answer them truthfully...

314
00:24:53,673 --> 00:24:57,276
Not that you'll have
any choice about it.

315
00:24:57,310 --> 00:24:59,144
What is your name?

316
00:24:59,179 --> 00:25:01,146
Sayid.

317
00:25:01,181 --> 00:25:03,515
Sayid Jarrah.

318
00:25:03,550 --> 00:25:06,719
All right, Sayid.

319
00:25:06,753 --> 00:25:09,255
Why were you in handcuffs
when we found you?

320
00:25:09,289 --> 00:25:11,490
Because...

321
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:16,128
because I am a bad man.

322
00:25:16,162 --> 00:25:18,864
Were you running away
from your people?

323
00:25:18,899 --> 00:25:20,399
What people?

324
00:25:20,433 --> 00:25:21,700
The hostiles.

325
00:25:23,270 --> 00:25:26,572
I am not a hostile.

326
00:25:26,606 --> 00:25:28,874
Then where did you
come from, Sayid?

327
00:25:28,909 --> 00:25:31,677
I came on a plane.

328
00:25:31,711 --> 00:25:32,978
What plane?

329
00:25:33,013 --> 00:25:35,614
Ajira flight 3-1-6.

330
00:25:35,649 --> 00:25:38,150
And that's how
I returned to the island.

331
00:25:38,184 --> 00:25:40,052
"Returned"?
You've been here before?

332
00:25:40,086 --> 00:25:41,353
Oh, yes.

333
00:25:41,388 --> 00:25:42,988
The first time,

334
00:25:43,023 --> 00:25:45,291
I was
on Oceanic flight 8-1-5.

335
00:25:45,325 --> 00:25:47,326
It crashed.

336
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:49,828
I was here
for a hundred days.

337
00:25:49,863 --> 00:25:51,497
Then I left.

338
00:25:52,999 --> 00:25:55,768
Ask Sawyer.

339
00:25:55,802 --> 00:25:57,736
- Who's "Sawyer"?
- Who cares?!

340
00:25:57,771 --> 00:26:00,439
None of this matters.
Ask him about the Flame.

341
00:26:00,473 --> 00:26:02,508
<i>Quiet. </i>

342
00:26:02,542 --> 00:26:04,843
What do you know
about our stations here?

343
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:09,315
I know the Flame was
a communication station.

344
00:26:09,349 --> 00:26:13,719
The Pearl was to observe
other stations.

345
00:26:13,753 --> 00:26:16,488
The Swan was to study
electromagnetism.

346
00:26:16,523 --> 00:26:18,863
But, of course, that was
before the incident-

347
00:26:18,864 --> 00:26:19,725
The swan?!

348
00:26:19,759 --> 00:26:22,962
How could he know what
we were gonna name it?

349
00:26:22,996 --> 00:26:25,597
We haven't even built it yet!
I <i>told</i> you! He saw the model!

350
00:26:25,632 --> 00:26:27,666
- You see?! He <i>is</i> a spy!
- Hey!

351
00:26:27,701 --> 00:26:28,560
I knew it!

352
00:26:28,561 --> 00:26:30,135
Radzinsky!
I'm not gonna tell you again.

353
00:26:30,170 --> 00:26:31,203
Cool it.

354
00:26:34,641 --> 00:26:36,909
You're all going to die,
you know.

355
00:26:38,645 --> 00:26:39,812
What?

356
00:26:41,748 --> 00:26:43,782
You're going to be killed.

357
00:26:48,054 --> 00:26:51,190
How exactly
would you know this, Sayid?

358
00:26:51,224 --> 00:26:53,359
Because I am
from the future.

359
00:26:57,564 --> 00:27:00,466
Maybe I should've used
half a dropper.

360
00:27:01,801 --> 00:27:02,901
Oops.

361
00:27:09,175 --> 00:27:10,609
You...

362
00:27:10,643 --> 00:27:13,245
You used exactly enough.

363
00:27:16,683 --> 00:27:20,219
Bench grinder, lube equipment,
drill press over here.

364
00:27:20,253 --> 00:27:22,688
Plugs, bearings,
sockets, ratchets here.

365
00:27:22,722 --> 00:27:24,890
How are you
with a flat four engine?

366
00:27:26,893 --> 00:27:28,575
You have no idea what
I'm talking about, do you?

367
00:27:28,576 --> 00:27:29,528
No, not really.

368
00:27:29,562 --> 00:27:30,729
It's okay.

369
00:27:34,267 --> 00:27:36,735
Jack told you about us...

370
00:27:36,770 --> 00:27:40,205
No. Hurley, actually.

371
00:27:45,378 --> 00:27:48,947
It's kind of a relief, actually.

372
00:27:48,982 --> 00:27:51,417
I wasn't quite sure
how to do it

373
00:27:51,451 --> 00:27:54,753
without it sounding like
I was telling you to stay away.

374
00:27:54,788 --> 00:27:56,055
It's fine.

375
00:28:23,950 --> 00:28:25,651
All right...

376
00:28:25,685 --> 00:28:27,619
What do we do with him?

377
00:28:27,654 --> 00:28:29,955
We kill him.

378
00:28:32,292 --> 00:28:35,227
Hold on a second.
We're not killing anyone, right?

379
00:28:35,261 --> 00:28:37,062
He violated the truce.

380
00:28:37,097 --> 00:28:39,898
What do you think <i>they</i> would do
if they caught one of <i>us?</i>

381
00:28:39,933 --> 00:28:42,000
Since when did we start
acting like them?

382
00:28:42,035 --> 00:28:44,436
- We're civilized.
- Yes, we are.

383
00:28:44,471 --> 00:28:46,605
We have a rule of law.

384
00:28:46,639 --> 00:28:50,109
And we've given him every
opportunity to defend himself.

385
00:28:50,143 --> 00:28:53,579
Blah, blah, blah. Need I remind
you, this man's <i>seen</i> things?

386
00:28:53,613 --> 00:28:56,782
He <i>knows</i> things.
There's nothing to talk about.

387
00:28:56,816 --> 00:28:59,918
- He's a spy.
- You sure about that, Stu?

388
00:28:59,953 --> 00:29:01,920
He was trying to escape
from the hostiles.

389
00:29:01,955 --> 00:29:03,922
He obviously has problems
with his people.

390
00:29:03,957 --> 00:29:05,891
Yeah, and sharing our secrets

391
00:29:05,925 --> 00:29:08,527
are the quickest way for him
to solve those problems.

392
00:29:08,561 --> 00:29:10,695
Okay, I'm gonna need
a little more time to consider.

393
00:29:10,696 --> 00:29:11,763
Consider?

394
00:29:11,798 --> 00:29:13,799
I mean, the longer
he's among us,

395
00:29:13,833 --> 00:29:15,801
the-the more danger we're in.

396
00:29:15,835 --> 00:29:18,637
I can talk to him, Horace.
I just need more time.

397
00:29:18,671 --> 00:29:21,206
No, you <i>had</i> your chance, LaFleur!

398
00:29:21,241 --> 00:29:23,942
Why are we on <i>your</i> clock, Radzinsky?

399
00:29:23,977 --> 00:29:26,378
Horace, you've got to call
for a vote.

400
00:29:26,912 --> 00:29:29,481
Either we make a decision,

401
00:29:29,516 --> 00:29:32,784
or I call Ann Arbor...

402
00:29:32,819 --> 00:29:35,187
and they make it for us.

403
00:29:35,221 --> 00:29:37,890
Radzinsky's right.

404
00:29:39,526 --> 00:29:40,993
Horace, please...

405
00:29:41,027 --> 00:29:44,163
I can't...

406
00:29:44,197 --> 00:29:47,666
I can't sleep
with one eye open.

407
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:50,002
We have a baby now.

408
00:29:50,036 --> 00:29:52,037
We have to think about Ethan.

409
00:29:53,606 --> 00:29:56,108
We have to think
about all the children here.

410
00:29:58,077 --> 00:30:01,713
How are we going to feel safe
with this man around?

411
00:30:03,216 --> 00:30:05,884
I don't know what he's up to,

412
00:30:05,919 --> 00:30:09,321
but we can't keep him here.

413
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:15,494
We have no choice.

414
00:30:22,335 --> 00:30:24,403
Okay.

415
00:30:24,437 --> 00:30:26,939
Let's put it to a vote.

416
00:30:26,973 --> 00:30:28,974
All in favor
of Radzinsky's solution,

417
00:30:29,008 --> 00:30:30,642
raise your hand.

418
00:30:41,554 --> 00:30:43,455
LaFleur?

419
00:30:48,661 --> 00:30:51,396
I would really like to say
it's unanimous.

420
00:31:06,153 --> 00:31:07,653
Mmm.

421
00:31:09,690 --> 00:31:12,825
Just for the record,

422
00:31:12,860 --> 00:31:15,428
I really was
just there for dinner.

423
00:31:15,462 --> 00:31:18,331
Are you afraid I'll get the wrong idea?

424
00:31:18,766 --> 00:31:21,167
Mmm.

425
00:31:21,201 --> 00:31:23,269
I think
it's too late for that.

426
00:31:33,547 --> 00:31:35,114
Take it off.

427
00:31:52,833 --> 00:31:56,669
You so much as flinch,
and you're dead.

428
00:31:56,703 --> 00:31:58,905
So who are you?

429
00:31:58,939 --> 00:32:01,374
You asked me earlier
if I was a professional.

430
00:32:01,408 --> 00:32:04,510
I am a professional.
I was hired to bring you to Guam.

431
00:32:04,545 --> 00:32:06,045
Who hired you?

432
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:08,247
The family of Peter Avellino-

433
00:32:08,282 --> 00:32:10,716
the man you killed
in cold blood last year

434
00:32:10,751 --> 00:32:13,453
on a golf course
in the Seychelles.

435
00:32:13,487 --> 00:32:16,422
- You're a bounty hunter?
- Doesn't matter what I am.

436
00:32:16,457 --> 00:32:20,226
You're going to answer
for what you've done.

437
00:32:27,501 --> 00:32:30,169
Hit me in the face.

438
00:32:30,204 --> 00:32:31,838
What?

439
00:32:31,872 --> 00:32:35,375
Go on. You owe me one anyway,
so make it a good one.

440
00:32:36,711 --> 00:32:38,712
Then I want you to take
these keys out of my pocket

441
00:32:38,846 --> 00:32:40,214
and let yourself out.

442
00:32:40,348 --> 00:32:43,467
The guard outside is Phil.
He's a dimwit, so I reckon

443
00:32:43,517 --> 00:32:46,453
you can get his gun before
he even realizes you're out.

444
00:32:46,987 --> 00:32:49,388
Just promise me
you won't shoot him.

445
00:32:49,423 --> 00:32:52,091
I appreciate the offer,
but I'm fine right here.

446
00:32:52,126 --> 00:32:53,726
They're gonna kill you.

447
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:56,562
They just took a vote.
Even the new mom wants you dead.

448
00:32:56,597 --> 00:32:59,198
I'm going to stay here, James.

449
00:32:59,233 --> 00:33:01,801
This morning, you were
begging me to let you go.

450
00:33:01,835 --> 00:33:04,270
- Why would you change your-
- Because...

451
00:33:04,304 --> 00:33:06,739
when I woke up in the jungle

452
00:33:06,773 --> 00:33:11,277
and I realized I was
back on this island...

453
00:33:11,311 --> 00:33:13,779
I felt there was
no purpose to it.

454
00:33:15,349 --> 00:33:18,484
But now I know
exactly why I'm here.

455
00:33:18,519 --> 00:33:21,053
To get shot? <i>Then</i> what?

456
00:33:23,157 --> 00:33:25,458
You're out of your mind.

457
00:34:00,294 --> 00:34:01,627
Hey.

458
00:34:02,262 --> 00:34:03,730
Hi.

459
00:34:09,336 --> 00:34:11,804
Why'd you come back?

460
00:34:11,838 --> 00:34:13,706
What?

461
00:34:13,740 --> 00:34:15,275
Sayid just filled my ear

462
00:34:15,409 --> 00:34:16,978
full of some crap
about his damn purpose,

463
00:34:17,112 --> 00:34:20,580
and I wanna know...
Why'd y'all come back?

464
00:34:21,114 --> 00:34:22,582
Uh...

465
00:34:22,616 --> 00:34:24,050
<i>Why,</i> Kate?

466
00:34:27,888 --> 00:34:31,290
I don't know why
everyone else came back.

467
00:34:31,325 --> 00:34:33,359
I just know why I did.

468
00:34:38,632 --> 00:34:39,932
What?

469
00:34:49,675 --> 00:34:51,444
What the hell?!

470
00:35:05,892 --> 00:35:07,493
Are you ok?

471
00:35:09,963 --> 00:35:12,365
Craig! Grab a wrench, open those
valves. Get the hoses going.

472
00:35:12,499 --> 00:35:14,068
Okay.

473
00:35:19,639 --> 00:35:21,507
Erin, grab the fire gear!

474
00:35:21,642 --> 00:35:23,576
Bill, go help Craig.

475
00:35:25,746 --> 00:35:27,480
What the hell happened?

476
00:35:27,514 --> 00:35:30,716
Three years-no burning buses.
Y'all are back for <i>one day... </i>

477
00:35:30,751 --> 00:35:32,918
Get on that hose.

478
00:35:43,030 --> 00:35:44,930
Man this hose!

479
00:35:44,965 --> 00:35:46,532
Push it out!

480
00:35:48,135 --> 00:35:51,637
All security! All security!
This is LaFleur! We have a fire!

481
00:35:51,672 --> 00:35:53,773
Everyone get to building 15 <i>now!</i>

482
00:35:53,807 --> 00:35:55,808
Roger that. I'm on my way.

483
00:36:17,764 --> 00:36:19,732
What happened
to your glasses?

484
00:36:19,766 --> 00:36:21,133
My dad.

485
00:36:21,168 --> 00:36:23,235
For bringing me
the sandwich?

486
00:36:23,270 --> 00:36:25,371
I know.

487
00:36:25,405 --> 00:36:27,940
My father was a
hard man as well.

488
00:36:27,974 --> 00:36:31,677
I really hate it here.

489
00:36:33,947 --> 00:36:36,449
If I let you out...

490
00:36:38,118 --> 00:36:41,620
will you take me with you,

491
00:36:41,655 --> 00:36:43,456
to your people?

492
00:36:45,525 --> 00:36:47,593
Yes, Ben, I will.

493
00:36:50,997 --> 00:36:53,733
That's why I'm here.

494
00:36:57,221 --> 00:36:58,889
<i>Attention, passengers. </i>

495
00:36:59,023 --> 00:37:01,658
<i>Ajira Airways flight 3-1-6</i>
<i>to Honolulu and Guam... </i>

496
00:37:07,730 --> 00:37:11,199
Are you sure
we're going to Guam?

497
00:37:11,234 --> 00:37:13,268
Where else would we be going?

498
00:37:22,577 --> 00:37:24,881
Can I ask you a favor?

499
00:37:25,815 --> 00:37:27,749
Can we get the next plane?

500
00:37:27,784 --> 00:37:29,151
Why?

501
00:37:29,185 --> 00:37:31,486
I'm very superstitious
when it comes to flying.

502
00:37:31,521 --> 00:37:34,590
I'll buy you a rabbit's foot
at the gift shop.

503
00:37:34,724 --> 00:37:37,325
This is
the plane we're taking.

504
00:37:47,003 --> 00:37:50,539
Sorry about the handcuffs,
but at least we're in business.

505
00:37:50,674 --> 00:37:53,943
Hold up! Wait, please!
Thank you for not closing it.

506
00:38:02,819 --> 00:38:04,754
What's he doing here?!
No, no, he can't come!

507
00:38:04,888 --> 00:38:07,323
Hurley, hey,
if you want to get back,

508
00:38:07,457 --> 00:38:10,426
- this is how it's gonna have to be.
- Are you working for Benjamin Linus?

509
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:13,362
- What?
- Are you working for him?

510
00:38:13,396 --> 00:38:15,030
Who's Benjamin Linus?

511
00:38:15,165 --> 00:38:18,166
He's a liar, a manipulator...

512
00:38:18,301 --> 00:38:20,570
a man who allowed
his own daughter to be murdered

513
00:38:20,704 --> 00:38:22,338
to save himself...

514
00:38:22,472 --> 00:38:25,474
A monster responsible
for nothing short of genocide.

515
00:38:27,443 --> 00:38:30,846
Why would I work
for somebody like that?

516
00:38:32,348 --> 00:38:33,849
I did.

517
00:39:08,618 --> 00:39:11,019
Hide!

518
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:39,982
Jin?

519
00:39:41,350 --> 00:39:42,484
Sayid.

520
00:39:45,087 --> 00:39:47,889
What are you doing here?
How did you get out?

521
00:39:48,024 --> 00:39:50,992
Sawyer let me go.
They were going to kill me.

522
00:39:51,027 --> 00:39:52,694
What?

523
00:39:52,729 --> 00:39:54,998
Attention. The prisoner escaped.

524
00:39:55,132 --> 00:39:57,567
The hostile is no longer
in custody. Be on the lookout.

525
00:39:57,701 --> 00:39:58,840
He could be armed.

526
00:39:58,890 --> 00:40:00,869
They don't know he released me.

527
00:40:01,004 --> 00:40:03,339
Please, Jin,
I need to keep moving.

528
00:40:03,773 --> 00:40:05,340
Okay.

529
00:40:05,374 --> 00:40:07,375
Let me talk to him first.

530
00:40:11,881 --> 00:40:14,950
- LaFleur, it's Jin here.
- Come in.

531
00:40:20,723 --> 00:40:21,990
Whoa!

532
00:40:22,024 --> 00:40:24,593
