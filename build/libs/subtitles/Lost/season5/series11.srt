Previously on "Lost"...

2
00:00:02,005 --> 00:00:04,080
This is your daughter.

3
00:00:04,390 --> 00:00:05,640
Her name's Clementine.

4
00:00:05,740 --> 00:00:07,245
Those are fake necklaces.

5
00:00:07,345 --> 00:00:09,015
I'll take
the one on the end.

6
00:00:09,115 --> 00:00:10,195
Why'd you help me?

7
00:00:10,295 --> 00:00:12,970
Just one girl watching
another girl's back, I guess.

8
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:17,775
Why are you
telling me this?

9
00:00:17,875 --> 00:00:19,930
Just do it, freckles.

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,005
I think we should say he's mine.

11
00:00:24,105 --> 00:00:25,940
There's other ways to do this.

12
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:29,710
After everyone we've lost,
I can't lose him, too.

13
00:00:29,810 --> 00:00:32,095
My client insists that we...

14
00:00:32,195 --> 00:00:35,330
handle the exchange of custody quietly.

15
00:00:35,740 --> 00:00:38,180
You are going to lose the boy.

16
00:00:38,590 --> 00:00:40,645
That's Claire's mother.

17
00:00:40,745 --> 00:00:43,690
Everything that Kate and I
have done, it was for Aaron.

18
00:00:43,790 --> 00:00:46,510
Who's... Aaron?

19
00:00:52,370 --> 00:00:53,505
I'm Ben.

20
00:00:53,605 --> 00:00:55,880
It's nice to meet you, Ben.

21
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:58,700
if I let you out,

22
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:01,270
will you take me with
you to your people?

23
00:01:01,370 --> 00:01:03,240
That's why I'm here.

24
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:10,015
Jin?

25
00:01:10,115 --> 00:01:12,090
What are you doing here?

26
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:24,970
Hello, Jin? Are you there?

27
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:29,510
Jin? Can you hear me?

28
00:01:30,730 --> 00:01:31,595
Hello?

29
00:01:31,695 --> 00:01:34,345
Jin? It's-it's Phil, man.
Where have you been?

30
00:01:34,445 --> 00:01:37,035
The hostile escaped.
We're searching the east grid.

31
00:01:37,135 --> 00:01:38,910
He's headed north.

32
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:41,360
How the hell do you know that?

33
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:43,340
Because he attacked me.

34
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:46,830
What? Where are you?

35
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:52,980
Jin?! You still there?
Jin? Jin!

36
00:01:58,970 --> 00:02:01,500
Please, help.

37
00:02:14,950 --> 00:02:16,955
Okay, everybody, listen up.

38
00:02:17,055 --> 00:02:19,840
We don't know yet if
another attack is coming,

39
00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:23,360
so everybody needs to be ready for
your security assignments, okay?

40
00:02:23,690 --> 00:02:26,895
Make sure you're in contact
with your team leaders.

41
00:02:26,995 --> 00:02:31,710
LaFleur's got search parties out, but
the hostile's got a good jump on us.

42
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:36,380
We're pretty sure he used this fire
as a diversion in order to escape.

43
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:39,760
Is he talking about Sayid?

44
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:43,370
If he was locked up,
how could he start the fire?

45
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:45,885
Who are you?

46
00:02:45,985 --> 00:02:48,760
Jack Shephard. I'm... I'm new.

47
00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:53,015
Well, Jack, the way he started
the fire is he had help, okay?

48
00:02:53,115 --> 00:02:57,075
Somebody torched that van, and then
that somebody let him out of his cell.

49
00:02:57,175 --> 00:03:01,240
And since the security cameras didn't pick
up any hostiles crossing the perimeter,

50
00:03:01,570 --> 00:03:03,780
that means it was one of us.

51
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:09,550
Baxter, I want a full
report on cleanup ASAP.

52
00:03:09,650 --> 00:03:11,130
You got it, Horace.

53
00:03:15,950 --> 00:03:18,000
Hey, you.

54
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:20,405
Yeah, you.

55
00:03:20,505 --> 00:03:22,330
You're in the motor pool, right?

56
00:03:22,770 --> 00:03:25,180
- Uh, yeah.
- Do you mind running that winch for me?

57
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:29,640
You have no idea what
I'm talking about, do you?

58
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:32,156
Okay, no worries.
Just throw this lever.

59
00:03:32,256 --> 00:03:34,295
When I tell you to
stop... just pull it up.

60
00:03:34,395 --> 00:03:35,605
- All right.
- See? Simple.

61
00:03:35,705 --> 00:03:37,880
- Don't do it till I'm ready.
- Okay.

62
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:40,990
All right, crank her up.

63
00:03:47,710 --> 00:03:50,205
So they just stuck you in the
motor pool when you got here?

64
00:03:50,305 --> 00:03:51,695
Yeah, pretty much.

65
00:03:51,795 --> 00:03:53,950
Yeah, same thing happened to me.

66
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:57,205
Wait, hold. Hold it there.
That's good right there. That's good.

67
00:03:57,305 --> 00:03:59,425
I guess they couldn't sucker
anybody into getting on that sub

68
00:03:59,525 --> 00:04:01,995
if they told us we were gonna
be grease monkeys and janitors.

69
00:04:02,095 --> 00:04:04,590
- Well, you gotta start somewhere, right?
- Yeah.

70
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,490
- What's your name?
- I'm Kate.

71
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:10,851
Welcome aboard, Kate.

72
00:04:10,951 --> 00:04:12,960
I'm Roger. Roger Linus.

73
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:19,390
It's nice to meet you, Roger.

74
00:04:36,690 --> 00:04:38,850
That's my kid.

75
00:04:40,210 --> 00:04:42,080
That's my kid!

76
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:16,850
Hi, handsome.
Did you have a good sleep?

77
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:19,485
Yeah, that's my boy.

78
00:05:19,585 --> 00:05:24,275
# Catch a falling star
and put it in your pocket

79
00:05:24,375 --> 00:05:28,575
# Never let it fade away

80
00:05:28,675 --> 00:05:34,310
# Catch a falling star
and put it in your pocket

81
00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:38,360
# Save it for a rainy day #

82
00:05:42,770 --> 00:05:44,620
Oh, my God!

83
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:45,785
Hi, Cassidy.

84
00:05:45,885 --> 00:05:48,155
Oh, my God! I saw you on the news!

85
00:05:48,255 --> 00:05:50,560
I told all my friends,
"I know that woman!"

86
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:54,485
- This is Aaron.
- Hi, Aaron.

87
00:05:54,585 --> 00:05:55,975
Say hi.

88
00:05:56,075 --> 00:05:58,650
You survived a plane crash.

89
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:00,082
It's amazing.

90
00:06:00,182 --> 00:06:03,840
I never thought I'd see you again.
What are you doing here?

91
00:06:07,030 --> 00:06:09,130
Sawyer sent me.

Lost Season 05 Episode 11
"Whatever Happened, Happened"

95
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:31,405
Sawyer.

96
00:06:31,505 --> 00:06:34,320
So that son of a bitch is still alive?

97
00:06:35,710 --> 00:06:37,465
He was when I left.

98
00:06:37,565 --> 00:06:41,255
And he asked you to come here and
give me an envelope full of money?

99
00:06:41,355 --> 00:06:45,130
Well, he-he told me
where to find you, and...

100
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:50,255
said to take care of Clementine...
his daughter?

101
00:06:50,355 --> 00:06:53,090
Well, she's asleep
in her crib right now.

102
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:55,720
Want me to wake her up?

103
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:01,340
I, uh, shouldn't have bothered you.

104
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:03,435
I could've sent it,
and I probably should have.

105
00:07:03,535 --> 00:07:05,900
Why did you tell me all this?

106
00:07:06,590 --> 00:07:08,710
Why'd you trust me?

107
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:13,070
Because I thought your daughter had
a right to know that her father cared.

108
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:16,430
Why didn't he come back
with the rest of you?

109
00:07:16,990 --> 00:07:19,195
The helicopter that we were
on was running out of gas,

110
00:07:19,295 --> 00:07:22,720
so he jumped so that we
could make it to the boat.

111
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:29,560
What a coward.

112
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:32,095
He was trying to do the right thing.

113
00:07:32,195 --> 00:07:34,710
He was trying to get away from you.

114
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:38,115
I told him he had a daughter.

115
00:07:38,215 --> 00:07:41,485
He never so much as lifted
a finger to try to call her.

116
00:07:41,585 --> 00:07:43,117
So now I'm supposed
to think he's a hero

117
00:07:43,217 --> 00:07:44,865
because he told you to
come here and help us?

118
00:07:44,965 --> 00:07:47,930
Hell, I bet this money's
not even his, is it?

119
00:07:50,130 --> 00:07:52,720
They gave us a settlement after the
crash, and I didn't need it all--

120
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:55,010
You don't have to explain it, Kate.

121
00:07:56,020 --> 00:07:59,410
You got the same look on your
face I did when he ditched me.

122
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:05,510
All I have for you is sympathy.

123
00:08:07,190 --> 00:08:08,960
Is it his?

124
00:08:09,170 --> 00:08:11,910
- What?
- Your son.

125
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:14,600
Is it Sawyer's?

126
00:08:15,630 --> 00:08:18,100
No. No, I was...

127
00:08:19,210 --> 00:08:21,440
pregnant before I met him.

128
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:31,770
That's not your baby, is it?

129
00:08:35,060 --> 00:08:39,060
Kate, you just told me that you and your
friends cooked a story for the whole world

130
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:41,670
about what happened on that island.

131
00:08:42,150 --> 00:08:44,870
So you tell me the truth about that?

132
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:48,030
Why are you lying to me about him?

133
00:08:51,340 --> 00:08:53,490
Because I have to.

134
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:22,325
What happened?

135
00:09:22,425 --> 00:09:23,530
What the hell are you doing here?

136
00:09:23,630 --> 00:09:26,495
That was Ben.
That kid who was shot was Ben.

137
00:09:26,595 --> 00:09:28,625
Was it Sayid? Did he shoot him?

138
00:09:28,725 --> 00:09:29,988
Here's what you need to do, Kate:

139
00:09:30,088 --> 00:09:31,935
Keep your mouth shut and
stop asking questions.

140
00:09:32,035 --> 00:09:34,815
'Cause putting any attention on yourself
is the last thing I need right now.

141
00:09:34,915 --> 00:09:36,155
Now scram.
I don't want you around here.

142
00:09:36,255 --> 00:09:38,890
- I just wanna know what's going on.
- LaFleur.

143
00:09:39,930 --> 00:09:43,950
What... what, uh...
what's she doing here?

144
00:09:45,570 --> 00:09:46,985
- This is, uh...
- I'm Kate.

145
00:09:47,085 --> 00:09:48,985
Kate. She's new over at the motor pool.

146
00:09:49,085 --> 00:09:51,920
I was seeing if she saw anything
suspicious, but she didn't, so...

147
00:09:52,310 --> 00:09:54,660
You can run along, thanks.

148
00:09:58,170 --> 00:10:00,275
Have you checked out
the hostile's cell yet?

149
00:10:00,375 --> 00:10:02,955
I was a little busy trying to keep
the town from burnin' down, Horace.

150
00:10:03,055 --> 00:10:05,420
Okay. Well, then let's do it.

151
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:14,195
He didn't break out.
Somebody let him out.

152
00:10:14,295 --> 00:10:15,785
These are janitor's keys.

153
00:10:15,885 --> 00:10:17,430
We've only got three janitors.

154
00:10:17,530 --> 00:10:21,570
There's Roger, Willie
and, uh, that new guy.

155
00:10:21,670 --> 00:10:23,565
I just met him. His name's Jack.

156
00:10:23,665 --> 00:10:25,623
Yeah. I just brought him in
from the sub.

157
00:10:25,723 --> 00:10:26,555
I'll go talk to him.

158
00:10:26,655 --> 00:10:27,925
Miles, you wanna come with me?

159
00:10:28,025 --> 00:10:29,810
Yeah, sure, boss.

160
00:10:32,450 --> 00:10:35,530
All right, I want you to find Jack and
Hurley and Kate as quick as you can.

161
00:10:35,630 --> 00:10:37,010
Put 'em in a house and sit on 'em.

162
00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:37,985
What for?

163
00:10:38,085 --> 00:10:39,470
'Cause I don't want 'em
talking to anybody else.

164
00:10:39,570 --> 00:10:41,210
Things are starting to
spin out of control here.

165
00:10:41,310 --> 00:10:43,500
- All right, I got it.
- All right, go.

166
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:51,405
Who did this? Do you know
who did this to my son?

167
00:10:51,505 --> 00:10:53,255
Not yet, but we're working on it.
How's he doing?

168
00:10:53,355 --> 00:10:55,990
I don't know.
Juliet told me to wait out here.

169
00:10:56,460 --> 00:10:58,145
Let me see if I can
get an update for ya.

170
00:10:58,245 --> 00:11:00,120
Thanks, Jim.

171
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:01,815
- Roger?
- Yeah?

172
00:11:01,915 --> 00:11:03,045
You happen to have your keys with you?

173
00:11:03,145 --> 00:11:05,520
Yeah. Why? What do you need?

174
00:11:08,430 --> 00:11:11,005
I must've left them at-at the house.

175
00:11:11,105 --> 00:11:13,780
It's all right. Don't worry about it.

176
00:11:19,570 --> 00:11:21,335
More gauze.

177
00:11:21,435 --> 00:11:24,590
- Here's some gauze.
- Yeah, right here, yeah.

178
00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:26,379
If we can't stop the hemorrhaging,

179
00:11:26,479 --> 00:11:28,035
we're just gonna have
to pack the whole tract.

180
00:11:28,135 --> 00:11:30,375
- Okay.
- Where's the doctor?

181
00:11:30,475 --> 00:11:32,965
At the Looking Glass
station till Friday.

182
00:11:33,065 --> 00:11:35,985
- How is he doing?
- Not well. Hook him.

183
00:11:36,085 --> 00:11:38,985
He's still bleeding in there
somewhere, and I can't fix it.

184
00:11:39,085 --> 00:11:41,610
- It's all right.
- No, it's not all right.

185
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:45,515
Someone needs to get in there who can
find the damage that bullet did and fix it.

186
00:11:45,615 --> 00:11:47,620
He needs a real surgeon.

187
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:57,510
You're telling us we're
under house arrest?

188
00:11:57,610 --> 00:12:00,190
No, you're all free to
leave whenever you want...

189
00:12:00,290 --> 00:12:02,310
but I'll shoot you in the leg.

190
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:05,755
And whose idea was this?

191
00:12:05,855 --> 00:12:07,540
Who do you think?

192
00:12:08,150 --> 00:12:10,580
Sawyer's just doing his job, Jack.

193
00:12:16,020 --> 00:12:17,350
What the hell are you doing, tubby?

194
00:12:17,450 --> 00:12:19,350
Checking to see if I'm disappearing.

195
00:12:19,930 --> 00:12:22,115
- What?
- "Back to the future," man.

196
00:12:22,215 --> 00:12:25,545
We came back in time to the
island and changed stuff.

197
00:12:25,645 --> 00:12:28,520
So if little Ben dies,
he'll never grow up to be big Ben,

198
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:31,030
who's the one who made us come
back here in the first place.

199
00:12:31,130 --> 00:12:33,520
Which means we can't be here.
And therefore, dude,

200
00:12:33,990 --> 00:12:35,970
we don't exist.

201
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:38,760
You're an idiot.

202
00:12:39,510 --> 00:12:42,105
- Am I?
- Yeah. It doesn't work like that.

203
00:12:42,205 --> 00:12:44,205
You can't change anything.

204
00:12:44,305 --> 00:12:46,525
You're maniac Iraqi buddy shot Linus.

205
00:12:46,625 --> 00:12:48,140
That is what always happened.

206
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:52,110
It's just... we never experienced
how it all turns out.

207
00:12:56,220 --> 00:12:57,595
This is really confusing.

208
00:12:57,695 --> 00:12:59,710
Yeah, well, get used to it.

209
00:13:00,030 --> 00:13:03,236
But the good news is
that Linus didn't die,

210
00:13:03,336 --> 00:13:05,755
so that means the kid can't either.

211
00:13:05,855 --> 00:13:07,080
He'll be fine.

212
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:09,210
Didn't look like he was gonna be fine.

213
00:13:09,310 --> 00:13:10,150
What if you're wrong?

214
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:13,115
Well, if I'm wrong, then I
guess we all stop existing,

215
00:13:13,215 --> 00:13:16,540
and none of it matters
anyway then, does it?

216
00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:22,210
Doc, I need you to come with me.

217
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Come with you where?

218
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:26,510
Juliet said the kid's losing blood, and
we ain't got none to put back in him.

219
00:13:26,610 --> 00:13:28,910
So we need you to show
us where he sprung a leak.

220
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:36,140
No.

221
00:13:37,450 --> 00:13:38,745
What?

222
00:13:38,845 --> 00:13:40,990
No, I'm not coming with you.

223
00:13:41,370 --> 00:13:44,540
If you don't come with me,
Jack, that kid's gonna die.

224
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:55,290
Then he dies.

225
00:14:13,340 --> 00:14:15,210
What are you doing?

226
00:14:15,910 --> 00:14:17,310
Making some sandwiches.

227
00:14:17,410 --> 00:14:19,020
I figured everybody'd
be getting hungry by now.

228
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:22,300
He's just a boy, Jack.
You can'just let him die.

229
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:24,874
You heard Miles.

230
00:14:24,974 --> 00:14:27,055
We can't change what's
already happened.

231
00:14:27,155 --> 00:14:28,255
This has nothing to do with me.

232
00:14:28,355 --> 00:14:31,070
Unless you're the one
who's supposed to save him.

233
00:14:32,050 --> 00:14:33,114
30 years from now,

234
00:14:33,214 --> 00:14:37,705
that boy's gonna be a man that locks
me in a cage because he needs surgery.

235
00:14:37,805 --> 00:14:41,375
And then you're gonna come in and
you're gonna beg me to operate on him

236
00:14:41,475 --> 00:14:43,980
because he's threatening
to murder Sawyer.

237
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,995
I've already done this once.

238
00:14:47,095 --> 00:14:50,900
I've already saved Benjamin Linus,
and I did it for you, Kate.

239
00:14:52,770 --> 00:14:55,110
I don't need to do it again.

240
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:58,410
This is our fault.

241
00:14:58,930 --> 00:15:01,665
We brought Sayid back.
We caused this.

242
00:15:01,765 --> 00:15:05,760
You know, when we were here before,
I spent all of my time trying to fix things.

243
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:11,100
But... did you ever think that maybe the
island just wants to fix things itself?

244
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:16,190
And maybe I was just...
gettin' in the way?

245
00:15:19,290 --> 00:15:21,590
You know, I don't like the new you.

246
00:15:21,690 --> 00:15:26,630
I liked the old you, who wouldn't just
sit around and wait for things to happen.

247
00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:32,470
You didn't like the old me, Kate.

248
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:46,270
Where are you going?

249
00:15:50,170 --> 00:15:53,120
Just relax. You're okay.

250
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:57,585
I'm sorry. Juliet?

251
00:15:57,685 --> 00:15:59,455
One of the new people is here.

252
00:15:59,555 --> 00:16:03,460
She heard Ben needed blood,
says she's a universal donor.

253
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:14,500
This might hurt for a second.

254
00:16:16,490 --> 00:16:18,970
Good. Very brave.

255
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:25,050
So James told me that Jack wouldn't
help, but he didn't say why.

256
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:27,692
If I understood why
Jack does what he does,

257
00:16:27,792 --> 00:16:29,550
I sure as hell wouldn't
be sitting here.

258
00:16:30,510 --> 00:16:33,590
Off island, did something
happen with you two?

259
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:38,200
We were engaged.
Does that count?

260
00:16:42,260 --> 00:16:43,220
What's going on?

261
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:44,505
Roger, I asked you to wait outside.

262
00:16:44,605 --> 00:16:45,910
No, what's going on with my kid?

263
00:16:46,010 --> 00:16:49,550
Kate is giving us some fresh
blood so we can transfuse Ben.

264
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:52,215
Well, I'm not waitin' outside.

265
00:16:52,315 --> 00:16:55,680
You know, he could stay with me,
and you could check on Ben,

266
00:16:55,780 --> 00:16:59,570
and-and Roger here could keep me
company, make sure I don't pass out.

267
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:05,230
Okay. Roger, have a seat.

268
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:13,720
- Thanks.
- Sure.

269
00:17:17,490 --> 00:17:20,040
- He stole my keys.
- Sorry?

270
00:17:20,350 --> 00:17:22,830
LaFleur asked me where my keys were.

271
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:26,870
That bastard doesn't ask any questions
he doesn't know the answers to...

272
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:32,070
which means my son stole my keys so
he could bust that animal out of jail.

273
00:17:33,110 --> 00:17:35,970
Why-why would he do that?

274
00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:39,490
Because of me.

275
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:45,210
You got kids?

276
00:17:46,790 --> 00:17:48,940
No.

277
00:17:50,510 --> 00:17:55,710
I thought I was gonna be the
greatest father ever, you know?

278
00:17:58,090 --> 00:18:00,860
I guess it didn't work out that way.

279
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:03,755
What about his mother?
Is she still around?

280
00:18:03,855 --> 00:18:06,395
No, she's dead.

281
00:18:06,495 --> 00:18:09,270
She died the day he was born.

282
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:13,100
I'm sorry.

283
00:18:13,580 --> 00:18:16,320
Yeah, me too.

284
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:22,290
I tried to do what I thought
she'd want me to do, but...

285
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:26,970
I guess a boy just needs his mother.

286
00:18:33,850 --> 00:18:35,795
- What's going on?
- He's going into hypoxic shock.

287
00:18:35,895 --> 00:18:37,177
What does that mean?
What's the matter with him?

288
00:18:37,277 --> 00:18:39,018
He needs more oxygen.
Roger, get out of here!

289
00:18:39,118 --> 00:18:39,585
What?

290
00:18:39,685 --> 00:18:40,915
- Get him out of here!
- Wait! What--what is--

291
00:18:41,015 --> 00:18:43,630
- Please, Roger, just wait outside.
- Wait a minute.

292
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:50,340
Let me get this straight.

293
00:18:50,740 --> 00:18:53,970
- All this already happened.
- Yes.

294
00:18:54,740 --> 00:18:57,865
So this conversation
we're having right now...

295
00:18:57,965 --> 00:19:00,540
- We already had it.
- Yes!

296
00:19:00,830 --> 00:19:02,965
Then what am I gonna say next?

297
00:19:03,065 --> 00:19:04,495
I don't know.

298
00:19:04,595 --> 00:19:06,495
Then your theory is wrong!

299
00:19:06,595 --> 00:19:11,215
For the thousandth time, you dingbat,
the conversation already happened,

300
00:19:11,315 --> 00:19:12,655
but not for you and me.

301
00:19:12,755 --> 00:19:16,190
For you and me,
it's happening right now.

302
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:19,300
Okay, answer me this.

303
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:22,665
If all this already
happened to me, then...

304
00:19:22,765 --> 00:19:24,660
why don't I remember any of it?

305
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:27,605
Because once Ben turned that wheel,

306
00:19:27,705 --> 00:19:31,460
time isn't a straight
line for us anymore.

307
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:36,510
Our experiences in the
past and the future occurred

308
00:19:36,985 --> 00:19:40,350
before these experiences right now.

309
00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:45,790
Say that again.

310
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:52,730
Shoot me. Please. Please?

311
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:54,410
I can't shoot you.

312
00:19:54,510 --> 00:19:57,356
Because if you die in 1977,
then you'll never come back

313
00:19:57,456 --> 00:19:59,825
to the island on the freighter
30 years from now.

314
00:19:59,925 --> 00:20:03,405
I can die because I've already
come to the island on the freighter.

315
00:20:04,105 --> 00:20:07,280
Any of us can die
because this is our present.

316
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:10,139
But you said Ben couldn't die
because he still has to grow up

317
00:20:10,239 --> 00:20:11,440
and become the leader of the others.

318
00:20:11,540 --> 00:20:12,955
Because this is his past.

319
00:20:13,055 --> 00:20:16,755
But when we first captured Ben,
and Sayid, like, tortured him,

320
00:20:17,555 --> 00:20:22,050
then why wouldn't he remember getting
shot by that same guy when he was a kid?

321
00:20:32,170 --> 00:20:34,440
I hadn't thought of that.

322
00:20:50,430 --> 00:20:51,500
How is he?

323
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:52,360
He's stable.

324
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:53,340
Is he gonna be okay?

325
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:56,270
He's got some fresh blood running
through him, which is a good thing.

326
00:20:56,370 --> 00:20:58,280
Roger, I need you to go out
to the medical station.

327
00:20:58,380 --> 00:21:02,090
There are some supplies there
that we don't have here.

328
00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:04,700
Hey, I just wanna say, I-I...

329
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:05,760
I wanna say thanks.

330
00:21:05,810 --> 00:21:08,260
I know that you're doing
everything you can...

331
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:12,430
to save him, and--

332
00:21:13,070 --> 00:21:16,890
All right,I'm-I'm gonna go,okay?

333
00:21:21,950 --> 00:21:24,950
Is he any better?

334
00:21:25,050 --> 00:21:28,010
He is stable now.

335
00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:30,300
But I can't, um...

336
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:31,640
I can't fix it.

337
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:32,690
What about the sub?

338
00:21:32,790 --> 00:21:33,920
I mean, can we take him somewhere?

339
00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:34,780
No. It's gone.

340
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:36,290
It won't be back for a couple of months.

341
00:21:36,390 --> 00:21:37,890
But he can't die, right?

342
00:21:37,990 --> 00:21:39,650
He is going to die.

343
00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:43,040
He is in a medical situation
that is not resolvable.

344
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:44,800
Okay, well, we can't just
sit here and do nothing.

345
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:46,700
I mean, there's got to be
someone who can help him.

346
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:50,030
We have an entire k--

347
00:21:53,620 --> 00:21:55,370
What?

348
00:22:00,670 --> 00:22:03,450
Maybe there's something they can do.

349
00:22:03,550 --> 00:22:06,390
"They"?

350
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:09,290
The Others.

351
00:22:21,380 --> 00:22:22,310
You got him?

352
00:22:22,410 --> 00:22:23,740
Yeah. Ready?

353
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:25,910
One, two, three, go.

354
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:37,540
Okay, let's go.

355
00:22:38,860 --> 00:22:39,790
I'm coming with you.

356
00:22:39,890 --> 00:22:41,110
No, no, no, no.

357
00:22:41,210 --> 00:22:42,539
If something goes wrong
or we get caught,

358
00:22:42,639 --> 00:22:43,320
it doesn't matter for me,

359
00:22:43,420 --> 00:22:45,060
but you've got a whole life here.

360
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:48,650
And besides, if Sawyer knew that I got
you involved in this, he'd kill me.

361
00:22:48,750 --> 00:22:50,960
How are you gonna manage?

362
00:22:51,060 --> 00:22:53,750
I'll manage, don't worry.

363
00:22:54,730 --> 00:22:57,990
Kate, Sawyer's gonna find out
Ben's gone, and when he does,

364
00:22:58,090 --> 00:23:00,190
I have to tell him what happened.

365
00:23:00,290 --> 00:23:03,420
But I'll give you as much
of a head start as I can.

366
00:23:03,950 --> 00:23:05,950
Good luck.

367
00:23:15,890 --> 00:23:18,010
There's someone...

368
00:23:18,110 --> 00:23:20,200
someone here in Los Angeles.

369
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:21,400
Let me take you to them.

370
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:22,180
Who?

371
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:26,800
The same person that's gonna show us
how to get back the island.

372
00:23:27,170 --> 00:23:30,240
Is that what this is about?

373
00:23:30,340 --> 00:23:31,640
You knew about this.

374
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:32,353
No, I was o--

375
00:23:32,453 --> 00:23:34,090
And that is why you were
pretending to care about Aaron,

376
00:23:34,190 --> 00:23:35,300
to convince me to go back there?

377
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:36,550
I wasn't pretending anything.

378
00:23:36,650 --> 00:23:38,250
This is insane. You guys are crazy.

379
00:23:38,350 --> 00:23:41,750
- Kate--
- Jack,don't!

380
00:23:50,770 --> 00:23:52,840
Mommy, I'm thirsty.

381
00:23:52,940 --> 00:23:56,120
I need some milk.

382
00:24:01,150 --> 00:24:03,350
Do you want chocolate milk
or regular milk?

383
00:24:03,450 --> 00:24:06,040
Juice box.

384
00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:07,520
You don't want milk anymore?

385
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:10,400
Juice box.

386
00:24:11,770 --> 00:24:12,940
Excuse me.

387
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:14,940
Where are you juice boxes?

388
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:15,740
Aisle 5.

389
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:18,870
Thank you very much.

390
00:24:34,510 --> 00:24:37,110
Aaron?

391
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:41,400
Um, excuse me.
Have you seen my son?

392
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:44,610
- I'm sorry?
- A little 3-year-old blond?

393
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:47,100
Aaron?

394
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:49,950
Aaron?

395
00:24:50,050 --> 00:24:52,850
Aaron?

396
00:24:53,470 --> 00:24:56,070
Aaron!

397
00:25:03,980 --> 00:25:05,900
Excuse me. I've lost my son.

398
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,020
He's 3. He's a little blond boy.

399
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:08,540
Don't worry, ma'am.
I'll make an announcement.

400
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:09,351
No, no, no.

401
00:25:09,451 --> 00:25:11,810
You have to seal
off the store. You...

402
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:16,680
Aaron?

403
00:25:16,780 --> 00:25:19,550
Hey, is this your mommy?
Honey, is this your mommy?

404
00:25:19,650 --> 00:25:21,280
I found him in the fruit section.

405
00:25:21,380 --> 00:25:22,745
I--he looked lost.

406
00:25:22,846 --> 00:25:25,260
I was getting ready to
make an announcement.

407
00:25:27,970 --> 00:25:30,880
Thank you. Thank you very much.

408
00:25:33,980 --> 00:25:36,520
It's okay, honey.
Mommy's got you.

409
00:25:36,620 --> 00:25:39,610
Mommy's got you.

410
00:26:04,550 --> 00:26:06,210
Tell--

411
00:26:06,830 --> 00:26:08,930
Tell my--

412
00:26:09,030 --> 00:26:10,590
Try not to talk,okay?

413
00:26:10,690 --> 00:26:15,430
Tell my dad I'm sorry I stole his keys.

414
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:41,160
I know you gotta stop me...

415
00:26:41,260 --> 00:26:44,140
but I can't just let that kid die.

416
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:49,710
Damn it, freckles.
I ain't here to stop you.

417
00:26:50,820 --> 00:26:53,680
I'm here to help you.

418
00:27:08,580 --> 00:27:09,940
Hi, Auntie Kate!

419
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:11,290
Hi, Clementine.

420
00:27:11,390 --> 00:27:12,330
Is your mommy home?

421
00:27:12,430 --> 00:27:14,550
Sure. I'll go get her.

422
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:16,780
They're going back?

423
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:18,390
To the island?

424
00:27:18,490 --> 00:27:20,360
Why in God's name would
they wanna do that?

425
00:27:20,460 --> 00:27:21,970
I don't know.

426
00:27:22,070 --> 00:27:25,720
Jack says that we weren't
supposed to leave.

427
00:27:25,820 --> 00:27:28,870
Well, Jack sounds like a piece of work.

428
00:27:28,970 --> 00:27:30,880
You look exhausted. Drink this.

429
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:33,629
Curl up on my bed.
Take a nap.

430
00:27:33,729 --> 00:27:35,540
I'll watch your fella.

431
00:27:38,140 --> 00:27:41,150
I lost him.

432
00:27:41,250 --> 00:27:43,520
What?

433
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:44,580
I don't know what happened.

434
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:48,230
We were in the supermarket,
and I turned around for one second,

435
00:27:48,330 --> 00:27:50,780
and he was gone.

436
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:56,330
And, you know,
the crazy thing is, is that...

437
00:27:56,430 --> 00:28:00,250
as scared as I was...

438
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:03,890
I wasn't surprised.

439
00:28:03,990 --> 00:28:09,590
All I could think was, it's about time.

440
00:28:10,970 --> 00:28:12,520
Why would I feel that way?

441
00:28:12,620 --> 00:28:16,480
I mean, why would I
expect him to be taken?

442
00:28:17,690 --> 00:28:21,380
Because you took him, Kate.

443
00:28:23,510 --> 00:28:25,900
No, I...

444
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,680
Claire was gone.

445
00:28:28,780 --> 00:28:30,440
I mean, she left him.

446
00:28:30,540 --> 00:28:34,210
I had to take him.
He needed me.

447
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:39,960
You needed him.

448
00:28:43,390 --> 00:28:47,300
Sawyer broke your heart.

449
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:51,310
How else were you supposed to fix it?

450
00:29:03,180 --> 00:29:06,260
Figure out how you were gonna
carry him out there by yourself?

451
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:07,860
Well, the line's just
right over there, right?

452
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:09,160
The Others are on the other side.

453
00:29:09,260 --> 00:29:12,500
Well, they ain't right on the other side.

454
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:14,610
We better get movin'.

455
00:29:15,430 --> 00:29:17,050
Why are you doing this?

456
00:29:17,150 --> 00:29:19,570
Why are you helping me?

457
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:22,045
When I found out Ben was gone,

458
00:29:22,145 --> 00:29:24,350
and Juliet told me
what you were up to,

459
00:29:24,450 --> 00:29:26,760
I asked that exact damn question:

460
00:29:26,860 --> 00:29:29,680
Why are you helping Ben?

461
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:33,520
And she said,

462
00:29:33,620 --> 00:29:36,970
no matter what he's
gonna grow up to be,

463
00:29:37,070 --> 00:29:39,290
it's wrong to let a kid die.

464
00:29:40,730 --> 00:29:42,410
So...

465
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:46,610
that's why I'm doing this.

466
00:29:49,090 --> 00:29:51,160
I'm doing it for her.

467
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:08,840
Where's Jack?

468
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:10,510
Uh, he-he's in the shower. I think.

469
00:30:10,610 --> 00:30:11,530
Is he in trouble?

470
00:30:11,630 --> 00:30:13,410
I just need to talk to him.

471
00:30:13,510 --> 00:30:16,360
You two mind giving us some privacy?

472
00:30:19,930 --> 00:30:22,720
Hey, ask me more questions
about time travel.

473
00:30:32,510 --> 00:30:34,580
I needed you.

474
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:35,650
I'm sorry?

475
00:30:35,750 --> 00:30:37,340
That kid was bleeding out.

476
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:39,870
You're a surgeon, and I needed you.

477
00:30:39,970 --> 00:30:42,150
- That kid is Ben.
- That's not Ben yet.

478
00:30:42,250 --> 00:30:44,240
He's just a kid.

479
00:30:44,570 --> 00:30:46,160
Juliet, I'm sorry.

480
00:30:46,260 --> 00:30:47,230
I can't help you.

481
00:30:47,330 --> 00:30:49,020
I'm not asking for your help, Jack.

482
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:52,570
You made it pretty clear
you weren't interested.

483
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:55,670
It's up to Sawyer and Kate now.

484
00:30:55,770 --> 00:30:56,490
What?

485
00:30:56,590 --> 00:31:00,160
She's trying to save him,
and I sent James after her to help

486
00:31:00,260 --> 00:31:03,510
because they actually care.

487
00:31:03,610 --> 00:31:05,440
I came back here because I care, Juliet.

488
00:31:05,540 --> 00:31:07,140
I came back here
because I was trying to save you.

489
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:09,540
We didn't need saving!

490
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:12,940
We've been fine for three years.

491
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:17,270
You came back here for you.

492
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:24,240
At least do me the courtesy
of telling me why.

493
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:30,120
I came back...

494
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:34,150
because I was supposed to.

495
00:31:34,250 --> 00:31:36,460
Supposed to do what?

496
00:31:37,260 --> 00:31:39,160
I don't know yet.

497
00:31:41,870 --> 00:31:44,570
Well, you'd better figure it out.

498
00:31:56,090 --> 00:31:58,640
You know, I can take him for a while.

499
00:31:59,370 --> 00:32:02,200
Sure you can.

500
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:07,610
You know, his father said
that you think Ben broke Sayid out.

501
00:32:08,030 --> 00:32:12,250
Kid'll do almost anything
if he's pissed off enough at his folks.

502
00:32:13,150 --> 00:32:16,790
Is that why you asked me
to take care of your daughter?

503
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:23,320
Did you?

504
00:32:23,420 --> 00:32:25,560
Of course I did.

505
00:32:26,770 --> 00:32:28,370
Go ahead and tip his head back.

506
00:32:28,470 --> 00:32:29,480
What's she like?

507
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:31,560
Clementine?

508
00:32:31,660 --> 00:32:32,450
Yeah.

509
00:32:32,550 --> 00:32:33,890
Clementine.

510
00:32:33,990 --> 00:32:35,900
Oh, she's beautiful.

511
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:38,730
Looks just like you when she smiles.

512
00:32:39,230 --> 00:32:41,280
She's growing up fast.

513
00:32:41,380 --> 00:32:43,600
Already has a little attitude.

514
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:47,650
I bet you and Cassidy
had a lot to talk about.

515
00:32:47,750 --> 00:32:51,280
She had an interesting theory
on why you jumped off the chopper.

516
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:53,940
Yeah? What's that?

517
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:57,740
She thought you were worried
about what would happen if you didn't.

518
00:33:04,590 --> 00:33:07,740
You and me would've
never worked out, Kate.

519
00:33:10,820 --> 00:33:13,579
I wasn't any more fit
to be your boyfriend

520
00:33:13,679 --> 00:33:16,190
than I am to be that little girl's father.

521
00:33:16,290 --> 00:33:19,070
You seem to be doing
all right with Juliet.

522
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:22,890
Yeah.

523
00:33:22,990 --> 00:33:26,090
I've done a lot of growing up
the past three years.

524
00:33:27,670 --> 00:33:29,930
Hands up!

525
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:33,230
Do not move.

526
00:33:34,230 --> 00:33:35,750
I said, don't move.

527
00:33:35,850 --> 00:33:37,770
This is a violation of the truce.

528
00:33:37,870 --> 00:33:39,800
- You're over the line.
- We know.

529
00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:41,290
This kid's been shot.

530
00:33:41,390 --> 00:33:42,430
That's both of our problems.

531
00:33:42,530 --> 00:33:47,680
So unless you want to go to war,
you're gonna take us to Richard Alpert,

532
00:33:47,780 --> 00:33:51,320
and you're gonna do it now.

533
00:34:05,990 --> 00:34:11,080
Mrs. Littleton, um, I'm Kate Austen.

534
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:13,400
I know who you are.

535
00:34:16,820 --> 00:34:18,530
Come in.

536
00:34:19,230 --> 00:34:20,730
Thank you.

537
00:34:26,970 --> 00:34:29,810
Your friend Dr.Shephard
came here last night,

538
00:34:29,910 --> 00:34:33,320
going on and on about
some person named Aaron.

539
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:36,967
When I asked him who that was,

540
00:34:37,067 --> 00:34:39,460
he ran out of here like
the room was on fire.

541
00:34:43,430 --> 00:34:45,470
He's your grandson.

542
00:34:50,170 --> 00:34:52,530
And your daughter Claire...

543
00:34:53,330 --> 00:34:55,180
is alive.

544
00:34:58,310 --> 00:35:00,600
What are you talking about?

545
00:35:00,700 --> 00:35:02,310
Claire died in the plane crash.

546
00:35:02,410 --> 00:35:04,180
No, she survived.

547
00:35:04,580 --> 00:35:08,860
When we crashed, your daughter was
eight months pregnant, and...

548
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:11,790
she's the one who gave birth
on the island, not me.

549
00:35:12,190 --> 00:35:13,840
We lied.

550
00:35:13,940 --> 00:35:18,060
There were other survivors, too.
We just left them behind.

551
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:20,010
Why?

552
00:35:20,110 --> 00:35:22,310
Why would you leave her there?

553
00:35:23,310 --> 00:35:27,020
Because she disappeared,
and she left the baby behind.

554
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:30,060
We looked everywhere, but--

555
00:35:31,150 --> 00:35:34,350
That's when I started
taking care of Aaron.

556
00:35:36,550 --> 00:35:38,674
And when we were
rescued, we didn't--

557
00:35:38,774 --> 00:35:41,900
We had to decide
what to do with him.

558
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:46,310
And I knew that she had wanted him
to be adopted, but I couldn't.

559
00:35:47,310 --> 00:35:51,770
I had to protect him,
so I said he was mine.

560
00:35:52,870 --> 00:35:54,890
Why did you lie?

561
00:35:55,290 --> 00:35:59,020
Why didn't you come to me
in the first place?

562
00:36:02,340 --> 00:36:04,560
Because I needed him.

563
00:36:09,910 --> 00:36:11,910
I'm sorry.

564
00:36:15,010 --> 00:36:19,830
You're gonna see that he's so
sweet and kind and good.

565
00:36:25,860 --> 00:36:27,710
Where is he?

566
00:36:28,610 --> 00:36:30,580
Um, I checked in two doors down.

567
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:32,670
He's asleep.

568
00:36:32,770 --> 00:36:35,720
I know that this is
a lot for you to handle.

569
00:36:36,420 --> 00:36:38,030
But...

570
00:36:39,130 --> 00:36:43,940
When you're ready,
he's waiting for you.

571
00:36:45,580 --> 00:36:48,750
I told him that you're his grandmother,

572
00:36:48,850 --> 00:36:52,720
that you'll take care of him while
I'm gone and that I'll be back soon.

573
00:36:55,820 --> 00:36:58,780
Where are you going?

574
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:03,920
I'm going back to find your daughter.

575
00:38:09,100 --> 00:38:11,450
Bye-bye, baby.

576
00:38:29,870 --> 00:38:32,260
Don't worry. We got 'em
right where we want 'em.

577
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:33,990
Shut up and keep movin'.

578
00:38:34,090 --> 00:38:35,810
What's it look like I'm doing?

579
00:38:35,910 --> 00:38:37,940
Hello there, James.

580
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,100
Where the hell did you come from?

581
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:43,750
You asked my people to bring you to me.

582
00:38:43,850 --> 00:38:45,400
Here I am.

583
00:38:46,700 --> 00:38:48,590
Is that Benjamin Linus?

584
00:38:49,590 --> 00:38:51,400
You two know each other?

585
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:55,280
What happened to him?

586
00:38:55,380 --> 00:38:57,070
He was shot.

587
00:38:57,470 --> 00:38:58,350
And who might you be?

588
00:38:58,450 --> 00:39:00,270
She's with me.

589
00:39:01,470 --> 00:39:02,800
And why are you here?

590
00:39:02,900 --> 00:39:05,440
'Cause we need you to save his life.

591
00:39:05,540 --> 00:39:07,320
Can you?

592
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:23,400
If I take him,he's not ever
gonna be the same again.

593
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:24,970
What do you mean by that?

594
00:39:25,070 --> 00:39:26,960
What I mean is that...

595
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:30,680
he'll forget this
ever happened, and that...

596
00:39:31,180 --> 00:39:35,560
his innocence will be gone.

597
00:39:37,730 --> 00:39:40,470
He will always be one of us.

598
00:39:45,380 --> 00:39:47,950
You still want me to take him?

599
00:39:50,490 --> 00:39:51,920
Yes.

600
00:39:57,940 --> 00:39:59,670
Richard...

601
00:40:00,850 --> 00:40:03,110
you shouldn't do this
without asking Ellie.

602
00:40:03,510 --> 00:40:05,560
- And if Charles finds out--
- Let him find out.

603
00:40:05,660 --> 00:40:07,430
I don't answer to either of them.

604
00:40:07,930 --> 00:40:10,510
Wh-where are you taking him?

605
00:40:14,140 --> 00:40:15,830
Come on.

606
00:41:24,710 --> 00:41:26,590
Hello, Ben.

607
00:41:30,230 --> 00:41:32,750
Welcome back to the land of the living.
