Previously on "Lost"

2
00:00:02,457 --> 00:00:03,828
<i>Some lawyers
came to see me.</i>

3
00:00:03,928 --> 00:00:06,197
They wanted to test us
to see if Aaron's my son.

4
00:00:06,383 --> 00:00:07,883
You need to take care of them.

5
00:00:08,015 --> 00:00:11,415
<i>Wouldn't you do anything you
had to in order to keep Aaron?</i>

6
00:00:12,108 --> 00:00:13,200
Hello, Kate.

7
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:14,377
He's with me.

8
00:00:14,477 --> 00:00:16,361
He's the one who's trying
to take Aaron.

9
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:17,751
It was me.

10
00:00:19,209 --> 00:00:20,209
Sorry.

11
00:00:27,739 --> 00:00:28,539
Charlotte.

12
00:00:28,595 --> 00:00:30,328
<i>We have to go back to the Orchid.</i>

13
00:00:30,428 --> 00:00:32,606
That's where all this started.
Maybe it's where it'll all stop.

14
00:00:32,959 --> 00:00:34,742
<i>This is happening because they left.</i>

15
00:00:34,842 --> 00:00:37,024
I think it will stop if I can bring them back.

16
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:43,639
What is your name?

17
00:00:43,897 --> 00:00:44,897
Jin.

18
00:00:45,744 --> 00:00:47,244
I am Danielle.

19
00:00:47,374 --> 00:00:48,675
Danielle Rousseau.

20
00:02:16,806 --> 00:02:19,086
Why don't you leave me
and my son alone?

21
00:02:19,186 --> 00:02:20,865
'Cause he's not your son, Kate.

22
00:02:25,712 --> 00:02:27,011
Move away, Kate.

23
00:02:27,504 --> 00:02:29,004
- Sun...
- I said, move away!

24
00:02:29,136 --> 00:02:30,436
Sun, what are you doing?
Where is Aaron?

25
00:02:30,547 --> 00:02:31,847
He's in the car.

26
00:02:33,778 --> 00:02:35,457
Sun, listen,
I know you think you're helping--

27
00:02:35,557 --> 00:02:38,135
If it wasn't for you,
Jin would still be alive.

28
00:02:39,793 --> 00:02:41,185
I didn't kill your husband, Sun.

29
00:02:41,285 --> 00:02:42,877
- Yes, you did.
- No, I didn't

30
00:02:43,973 --> 00:02:45,753
Neither did anyone else,

31
00:02:45,853 --> 00:02:47,634
because he is not dead.

32
00:02:52,111 --> 00:02:53,111
You're lying.

33
00:02:53,222 --> 00:02:54,422
No, Sun.

34
00:02:55,727 --> 00:02:57,733
<i>Jin is still alive,</i>

35
00:02:58,282 --> 00:03:00,387
and I can prove it.

36
00:03:14,911 --> 00:03:20,212
<i>...17, 16, 23, 22..</i>

37
00:03:26,826 --> 00:03:28,126
Are you all right?

38
00:03:28,847 --> 00:03:31,647
You Rousseau?
Danielle Rousseau?

39
00:03:31,772 --> 00:03:33,372
Yes, that's right.

40
00:03:35,478 --> 00:03:36,778
Where are you from?

41
00:03:37,076 --> 00:03:39,275
- We sailed from Tahiti.
- When?

42
00:03:39,393 --> 00:03:40,393
November 15th.

43
00:03:40,532 --> 00:03:42,132
No. What year?

44
00:03:43,162 --> 00:03:44,562
1988.

45
00:03:46,374 --> 00:03:47,475
Why?

46
00:03:48,288 --> 00:03:49,788
What's the matter?

47
00:03:50,663 --> 00:03:53,264
I- I need go find my camp.

48
00:03:53,396 --> 00:03:54,597
What camp?

49
00:03:54,748 --> 00:03:56,347
You were on this island before?

50
00:03:56,469 --> 00:03:58,670
You see helicopter?

51
00:04:12,977 --> 00:04:14,173
Is there an antenna on the island?

52
00:04:14,273 --> 00:04:18,066
Hey, Jin. Please, is there...

53
00:04:18,582 --> 00:04:20,383
a radio tower?

54
00:04:25,183 --> 00:04:26,183
Okay...

55
00:04:28,992 --> 00:04:31,091
Is there a radio tower here?

56
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:33,248
Yes.

57
00:04:34,027 --> 00:04:38,407
But I- I must find my camp,
because maybe...uh...helicopter go there.

58
00:04:38,507 --> 00:04:40,285
Do you know where your camp is from here?

59
00:04:44,534 --> 00:04:45,232
No.

60
00:04:45,332 --> 00:04:46,829
How about from the radio tower?

61
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:51,361
Yes.

62
00:04:51,461 --> 00:04:55,258
Then go with us to the tower,
then we find your camp.

63
00:04:58,995 --> 00:04:59,995
Okay.

64
00:05:19,488 --> 00:05:21,289
Are you ready to go?

65
00:05:21,690 --> 00:05:22,787
Yes.

66
00:05:22,887 --> 00:05:24,487
Who are you hoping to find?

67
00:05:27,821 --> 00:05:29,021
My wife.

68
00:05:44,127 --> 00:05:46,926
<i>...16, 15, 23...</i>

69
00:06:25,092 --> 00:06:26,129
Nadine?

70
00:06:32,265 --> 00:06:33,485
Nadine?

71
00:06:34,586 --> 00:06:35,868
Nadine!

72
00:07:03,597 --> 00:07:05,597
Did you hear that?

73
00:07:05,733 --> 00:07:07,118
What is that?

74
00:07:09,118 --> 00:07:10,273
Monster.

75
00:07:21,101 --> 00:07:23,101

77
00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:37,582
- We go find her.
- No. We must go.

78
00:07:38,316 --> 00:07:40,067
You shut up.

79
00:07:41,704 --> 00:07:43,004
<i>Let's go.</i>

80
00:07:47,610 --> 00:07:48,610
Nadine!

81
00:07:53,530 --> 00:07:54,551
Nadine!

82
00:07:56,212 --> 00:07:58,013
Here's her stuff.

83
00:07:58,414 --> 00:07:59,504
Nadine!

84
00:08:00,607 --> 00:08:01,873
Nadine!

85
00:08:01,974 --> 00:08:03,441
Nadine!

86
00:08:03,541 --> 00:08:05,261
Nadine! Nadine!

87
00:08:11,306 --> 00:08:12,551
- Okay.
- I will go--

88
00:08:24,514 --> 00:08:27,316
Nadine! Nadine!

89
00:08:35,024 --> 00:08:36,358
Run!

90
00:09:03,546 --> 00:09:05,347
Save him!

91
00:09:05,998 --> 00:09:07,598
Quickly, follow it!
Careful!

92
00:09:46,764 --> 00:09:49,097
What was that thing?!

93
00:10:07,082 --> 00:10:08,799
<i>No! No!</i>

94
00:10:12,356 --> 00:10:14,421
<i>Do not leave anyone behind!</i>

95
00:10:23,868 --> 00:10:25,784
No! No.

96
00:10:25,884 --> 00:10:27,353
You don't go.

97
00:10:28,452 --> 00:10:30,090
With baby.

98
00:10:31,988 --> 00:10:33,441
No.

99
00:11:04,233 --> 00:11:05,741
What's wrong?

100
00:15:06,382 --> 00:15:08,101
- You!
- No!

101
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:09,302
You disappeared!

102
00:15:09,404 --> 00:15:10,570
No! Please, wait!

103
00:15:10,869 --> 00:15:13,144
- You're sick, too! You're a carrier!
- No!

104
00:15:45,789 --> 00:15:47,656
<i>Turn around slowly.</i>

105
00:16:00,404 --> 00:16:02,088
Jin?

106
00:16:02,188 --> 00:16:03,388
Sawyer?

107
00:16:03,489 --> 00:16:05,093
Jin!

108
00:16:06,592 --> 00:16:07,993
You gotta be kiddin' me!

109
00:16:08,492 --> 00:16:10,763
I thought you were on that
boat. I thought you were dead.

110
00:16:10,864 --> 00:16:13,300
No. No.
I--in water.

111
00:16:13,999 --> 00:16:15,751
Well, what do you say?

112
00:16:22,491 --> 00:16:23,960
Where is Sun?

113
00:16:30,567 --> 00:16:34,125
Where did that guy come from?
I thought he was on the boat.

114
00:16:34,225 --> 00:16:36,773
The blast must've thrown him in the water.

115
00:16:37,923 --> 00:16:40,362
He's been moving with
every flash, just like us.

116
00:16:41,861 --> 00:16:43,866
Every time the sky lights up,

117
00:16:43,966 --> 00:16:47,450
we... move through time.

118
00:16:51,831 --> 00:16:53,355
Translate.

119
00:16:54,392 --> 00:16:56,142
Please. Translate.

120
00:16:56,242 --> 00:16:59,111
You heard the man. Translate.

121
00:16:59,612 --> 00:17:02,366
Uh, he's Korean. I'm from Encino.

122
00:17:09,005 --> 00:17:12,161
He wants to know how you're
sure his wife is off the island.

123
00:17:13,860 --> 00:17:16,862
- You speak Korean, Red?
- Obviously.

124
00:17:16,964 --> 00:17:19,798
Tell him I'm sure,
but none of it will matter

125
00:17:19,901 --> 00:17:22,016
if we don't make it to the Orchid.

126
00:17:41,703 --> 00:17:43,240
Bring Sun back?

127
00:17:45,009 --> 00:17:46,727
Why you bring her back?

128
00:17:47,226 --> 00:17:49,813
Because she never should have left.

129
00:18:02,092 --> 00:18:05,545
I've spent the last three years thinking...

130
00:18:05,944 --> 00:18:07,981
<i>believing that he was dead.</i>

131
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:11,852
You say you have proof that
he's not. I want to see it.

132
00:18:11,953 --> 00:18:13,887
Why don't you put down the gun?
No one wants it to go off.

133
00:18:13,989 --> 00:18:15,941
<i>How do you know he's alive?!</i>

134
00:18:20,009 --> 00:18:21,827
There's someone...

135
00:18:22,931 --> 00:18:24,796
someone here in Los Angeles.

136
00:18:25,399 --> 00:18:28,325
Let me take you to them,
and I'll show you the proof.

137
00:18:28,425 --> 00:18:29,950
"Someone"? Who?

138
00:18:30,072 --> 00:18:33,838
The same person that's gonna show
us how to get back to the island.

139
00:18:34,342 --> 00:18:36,226
Is that what this is about?

140
00:18:38,564 --> 00:18:40,447
<i>- You knew about this?
- No. No, I was--</i>

141
00:18:40,547 --> 00:18:42,614
<i>And that is why you were
pretending to care about Aaron,</i>

142
00:18:42,718 --> 00:18:44,952
- to convince me to go back there?!
- I wasn't pretending anything.

143
00:18:45,052 --> 00:18:46,519
This is insane.
You guys are crazy.

144
00:18:46,619 --> 00:18:48,353
- Kate--
- Jack, don't!

145
00:18:51,510 --> 00:18:53,425
Sayid, where are you going?

146
00:18:53,529 --> 00:18:57,364
<i>I don't want any part of this.
And if I see you or him again,</i>

147
00:18:57,466 --> 00:19:00,851
it'll be extremely unpleasant for all of us.

148
00:19:09,359 --> 00:19:11,576
30 minutes, Sun.

149
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:13,613
We can be there in 30 minutes.

150
00:19:14,114 --> 00:19:16,616
And you'll have proof,
proof that he's alive.

151
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:20,970
Or you can shoot me and never know.

152
00:19:26,945 --> 00:19:28,576
Let's go.

153
00:19:39,255 --> 00:19:40,956
How far?

154
00:19:42,158 --> 00:19:44,276
It's just over the next ridge.

155
00:19:44,678 --> 00:19:47,545
- How you will leave the island?
- I'm not sure yet.

156
00:19:47,648 --> 00:19:48,627
I go with you.
No, no.

157
00:19:48,727 --> 00:19:49,850
It doesn't work like that.

158
00:19:49,950 --> 00:19:51,685
- It's a one-man job.
- Why?

159
00:19:51,785 --> 00:19:53,852
I don't know why, Jin. It just is.

160
00:19:54,456 --> 00:19:56,773
But I promise I'll bring Sun back.

161
00:19:58,540 --> 00:19:59,658
You okay?

162
00:19:59,759 --> 00:20:01,659
You wanna take a break?

163
00:20:02,263 --> 00:20:04,163
Just get there.

164
00:20:04,263 --> 00:20:05,596
Yeah.

165
00:20:05,699 --> 00:20:07,665
So, uh...

166
00:20:07,769 --> 00:20:09,634
do you speak any other languages?

167
00:20:09,738 --> 00:20:10,988
Just Klingon.

168
00:20:13,190 --> 00:20:15,340
Dan, is this gonna work?

169
00:20:15,744 --> 00:20:17,645
<i>It--it does make empirical sense</i>

170
00:20:17,745 --> 00:20:20,699
That if this started at the Orchid,
then that's where it's gonna stop.

171
00:20:20,849 --> 00:20:23,650
But... as far as bringing back people who left

172
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:25,750
in order to stop these temporal shifts,

173
00:20:25,854 --> 00:20:27,755
that's where we leave science behind.

174
00:20:28,754 --> 00:20:30,007
You okay?

175
00:20:34,142 --> 00:20:35,512
Oh, no!

176
00:20:50,292 --> 00:20:51,494
Come on!

177
00:21:09,079 --> 00:21:10,748
Charlotte!

178
00:21:15,385 --> 00:21:17,369
<i>- Charlotte.</i>
- Juliet.

179
00:21:17,469 --> 00:21:19,220
- Huh?
- You have a little...

180
00:21:22,394 --> 00:21:23,692
You, too.

181
00:21:26,031 --> 00:21:27,447
Charlotte!

182
00:21:27,547 --> 00:21:29,548
Can you hear me? Charlotte?

183
00:21:29,649 --> 00:21:31,184
<i>Charlotte, it's Daniel.
Talk to me.</i>

184
00:21:31,285 --> 00:21:32,568
Charlotte?
Char--

185
00:21:43,645 --> 00:21:45,332
What'd she say?

186
00:21:45,432 --> 00:21:48,333
Don't let them bring
her back, no matter what.

187
00:21:48,937 --> 00:21:50,885
Don't let them bring her back.

188
00:21:53,190 --> 00:21:56,059
<i>This place is death!</i>

189
00:22:07,355 --> 00:22:09,774
You said we'd be there in 30 minutes.

190
00:22:10,375 --> 00:22:12,493
I didn't account for traffic.

191
00:22:25,338 --> 00:22:27,358
Sun, I'm sorry.

192
00:22:27,458 --> 00:22:29,627
Sorry for what?

193
00:22:30,728 --> 00:22:32,896
For leaving Jin behind.

194
00:22:33,995 --> 00:22:36,599
When we landed that chopper on the boat...

195
00:22:37,702 --> 00:22:40,270
Everything was just happening so fast.

196
00:22:40,968 --> 00:22:43,675
I knew he was down below, but I...

197
00:22:45,176 --> 00:22:47,045
should've waited for him.

198
00:22:48,145 --> 00:22:50,279
<i>Why are you telling me this now, Jack?</i>

199
00:22:51,779 --> 00:22:54,802
Are you going to ask me not to kill Ben
if he's lying about my husband?

200
00:22:54,952 --> 00:22:58,856
<i>After what he just did to Kate,
if you don't do it, Sun, I will.</i>

201
00:23:01,755 --> 00:23:02,893
What are you doing?!

202
00:23:02,993 --> 00:23:05,327
<i>What I'm doing is helping you.</i>

203
00:23:05,431 --> 00:23:08,431
And if you had any idea
what I've had to do to keep you safe,

204
00:23:08,531 --> 00:23:10,401
<i>to keep your friends safe,</i>

205
00:23:10,501 --> 00:23:12,518
you'd never stop thanking me.

206
00:23:16,422 --> 00:23:17,974
You wanna shoot me? Then shoot me!

207
00:23:18,075 --> 00:23:19,943
But let's get on with it.

208
00:23:20,243 --> 00:23:21,993
What's it gonna be?

209
00:23:24,597 --> 00:23:26,198
Drive.

210
00:23:43,285 --> 00:23:45,135
Why can't daddy come with us?

211
00:23:45,235 --> 00:23:47,535
Charlotte, can you hear me?

212
00:23:48,139 --> 00:23:51,339
You know what my mum would say
about me marrying an American?

213
00:23:52,441 --> 00:23:55,944
Yeah, I know more about ancient
Carthage than Hannibal himself.

214
00:23:58,045 --> 00:23:59,681
What the hell is she talking about?

215
00:23:59,785 --> 00:24:01,116
I have no idea.

216
00:24:01,220 --> 00:24:02,392
Let's go. We have to keep moving.

217
00:24:02,492 --> 00:24:04,388
All right, somebody help me with Charlotte.

218
00:24:04,489 --> 00:24:07,156
- We're gonna have to carry her.
- No. She's gonna hold us up.

219
00:24:07,956 --> 00:24:09,274
We can't just leave her.

220
00:24:09,424 --> 00:24:11,027
<i>The flashes are
getting closer together.</i>

221
00:24:11,528 --> 00:24:13,164
Maybe when your nose starts bleeding,

222
00:24:13,264 --> 00:24:14,931
you'll realize we gotta
get out of Dodge now.

223
00:24:15,131 --> 00:24:17,124
<i>We'll come back for her
just as soon as we can.</i>

224
00:24:17,226 --> 00:24:19,620
No. No way.
We're not gonna leave her behind.

225
00:24:19,870 --> 00:24:22,798
Let them go without me, Daniel.
- No, Charlotte. No.

226
00:24:22,898 --> 00:24:24,425
We're not gonna leave you behind.

227
00:24:30,929 --> 00:24:32,739
- What the hell?!
- We have to move now!

228
00:24:32,839 --> 00:24:34,150
- He's right. Go.
- Charlotte--

229
00:24:34,250 --> 00:24:35,752
Just--no, just go!

230
00:24:35,853 --> 00:24:36,821
Charlotte...

231
00:24:36,921 --> 00:24:38,490
Ohh! Oh, turn it up.

232
00:24:39,490 --> 00:24:41,607
I love Geronimo Jackson.

233
00:24:44,310 --> 00:24:46,362
We're running out of time, Dan.

234
00:24:47,463 --> 00:24:49,013
Go.

235
00:24:50,750 --> 00:24:52,868
I'm gonna stay with her.

236
00:24:54,268 --> 00:24:55,837
Let me ask you something, John.

237
00:24:55,941 --> 00:24:57,807
<i>If we don't even know
when the hell we are,</i>

238
00:24:57,910 --> 00:25:00,079
what happens if the Orchid
ain't around anymore?

239
00:25:02,378 --> 00:25:04,315
Look for the well.

240
00:25:04,914 --> 00:25:06,985
You'll find it at the well.

241
00:25:09,084 --> 00:25:11,254
Yeah, we'll be sure and do that.

242
00:25:12,354 --> 00:25:13,707
Let's go.

243
00:25:53,614 --> 00:25:54,981
We're here.

244
00:25:57,019 --> 00:25:58,968
Thank God. What are the odds

245
00:25:59,068 --> 00:26:01,454
that we would end up in
the same time as this thing?

246
00:26:13,831 --> 00:26:15,566
You just had to say somethin'.

247
00:26:51,706 --> 00:26:54,307
How the hell did Charlotte
know this was here?

248
00:27:02,215 --> 00:27:04,050
- Daniel?
- Yes?

249
00:27:06,251 --> 00:27:08,321
I've been here before.

250
00:27:10,356 --> 00:27:13,110
You've been... You've been here before?

251
00:27:13,809 --> 00:27:16,013
I grew up here, on the island.

252
00:27:16,514 --> 00:27:18,583
There was this thing...

253
00:27:18,683 --> 00:27:20,517
This Dharma Initiative.

254
00:27:21,618 --> 00:27:23,520
And then I moved away with my mum.

255
00:27:24,121 --> 00:27:25,942
Just my mom,

256
00:27:26,042 --> 00:27:27,957
and I never saw my dad again.

257
00:27:28,858 --> 00:27:30,829
And then when I got back to England,

258
00:27:30,929 --> 00:27:33,464
when I would ask my mum
about this place, yeah?

259
00:27:33,964 --> 00:27:37,517
But she would say that it wasn't
real and that I'd made it up.

260
00:27:39,185 --> 00:27:43,308
That's why... I became
an anthropologist.

261
00:27:44,308 --> 00:27:46,978
To find this island again.

262
00:27:47,578 --> 00:27:50,881
It's what I've been
searching for my whole life.

263
00:27:52,580 --> 00:27:53,600
Charlotte...

264
00:27:55,735 --> 00:27:57,736
Why are you telling me this?

265
00:28:01,375 --> 00:28:03,477
Because I remember something now.

266
00:28:05,278 --> 00:28:07,096
When I was little...

267
00:28:07,395 --> 00:28:09,300
living here,

268
00:28:10,401 --> 00:28:13,068
there was this man,

269
00:28:13,168 --> 00:28:15,540
a crazy man, he really scared me.

270
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:19,875
And he told me that I had to leave
the island and never, ever come back.

271
00:28:19,977 --> 00:28:26,031
He told me that if I came back, I would die.

272
00:28:28,437 --> 00:28:29,885
Charlotte...

273
00:28:30,489 --> 00:28:32,456
I don't understand.

274
00:28:33,855 --> 00:28:35,657
Daniel.

275
00:28:36,460 --> 00:28:38,644
<i>I... I think that man was you.</i>

276
00:28:49,656 --> 00:28:51,809
You're going down there?

277
00:28:51,910 --> 00:28:53,343
Uh-huh.

278
00:28:54,444 --> 00:28:56,282
What exactly are you hoping to find?

279
00:28:56,382 --> 00:28:58,148
A way off the island.

280
00:28:58,549 --> 00:29:00,451
Expecting a subway?

281
00:29:01,351 --> 00:29:03,021
Good-bye, James.

282
00:29:04,421 --> 00:29:07,111
Juliet, Miles.
I'll see you when I get back.

283
00:29:07,211 --> 00:29:09,026
No. Stop.

284
00:29:09,526 --> 00:29:11,460
You don't bring Sun back.

285
00:29:12,164 --> 00:29:13,729
No, I have to bring them all back.

286
00:29:13,833 --> 00:29:15,598
That's- that's how it works.

287
00:29:15,698 --> 00:29:17,333
How you know?

288
00:29:17,937 --> 00:29:19,986
I-I... I just know.

289
00:29:21,791 --> 00:29:22,591
I will cut this.

290
00:29:22,674 --> 00:29:24,941
No. You do that, you'll kill every one of us.

291
00:29:25,041 --> 00:29:29,212
This island is bad. You don't
bring Sun back. You promise.

292
00:29:29,312 --> 00:29:30,848
You promise you don't bring my baby!

293
00:29:30,949 --> 00:29:33,718
All right. All right. You have my word.

294
00:29:34,318 --> 00:29:36,270
Promise, John.

295
00:29:39,606 --> 00:29:40,906
I promise.

296
00:29:52,286 --> 00:29:54,973
I won't go to Sun, Jin,
but she might find me.

297
00:29:56,774 --> 00:29:59,911
If she does, what do I tell her?

298
00:30:01,010 --> 00:30:03,263
You tell her I'm dead.

299
00:30:05,031 --> 00:30:07,785
You say I wash up.

300
00:30:07,885 --> 00:30:09,604
You bury me.

301
00:30:14,306 --> 00:30:16,076
Proof.

302
00:30:24,785 --> 00:30:26,818
I'll be back as soon as I can.

303
00:30:46,208 --> 00:30:48,791
You sure you don't want us to lower you down?

304
00:30:49,895 --> 00:30:52,096
Where would be the fun in that?

305
00:30:53,795 --> 00:30:54,999
<i>John.</i>

306
00:30:55,099 --> 00:30:57,953
If whatever you're attempting
to do actually works?

307
00:31:00,820 --> 00:31:02,456
Thank you.

308
00:31:04,024 --> 00:31:05,323
You're welcome.

309
00:31:41,492 --> 00:31:42,792
Uh-oh...

310
00:31:50,437 --> 00:31:51,557
God!

311
00:31:54,057 --> 00:31:55,741
John! Damn it, hold on!

312
00:32:07,288 --> 00:32:09,188
I think you can let go of that now.

313
00:32:16,165 --> 00:32:17,345
No.

314
00:32:17,447 --> 00:32:19,083
- No! No!
- James, stop.

315
00:32:19,184 --> 00:32:20,684
- No! No!
- James, stop.

316
00:32:20,785 --> 00:32:22,319
Come on and help me!

317
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:24,124
James.

318
00:32:26,224 --> 00:32:28,109
We can't help him.

319
00:32:33,380 --> 00:32:35,298
<i>Hold on. Hold on.</i>

320
00:32:35,799 --> 00:32:38,003
It's okay. Okay. Okay, hold on.

321
00:32:38,703 --> 00:32:39,903
You gotta hold on.

322
00:32:40,004 --> 00:32:41,873
Stay. Stay with me.

323
00:32:42,572 --> 00:32:44,272
Just stay, okay?

324
00:32:44,375 --> 00:32:46,611
You're gonna be fine.
Everything's gonna be okay.

325
00:32:46,711 --> 00:32:48,279
I've got a plan.

326
00:32:48,579 --> 00:32:49,947
I've got a plan.

327
00:32:50,047 --> 00:32:53,852
When we were back at the
hatch, I talked to Desmond.

328
00:32:54,453 --> 00:32:57,085
I told him to find my mother.

329
00:32:57,187 --> 00:32:59,489
She can help us, Charlotte.

330
00:32:59,589 --> 00:33:01,058
<i>She will help us.</i>

331
00:33:01,158 --> 00:33:03,458
How can your mother help us?

332
00:33:03,562 --> 00:33:05,581
She can.
She--

333
00:33:12,084 --> 00:33:14,788
Hey, hey. Listen, listen. Yeah?

334
00:33:17,156 --> 00:33:18,278
What?

335
00:33:20,677 --> 00:33:22,729
I'm not allowed to have
chocolate before dinner.

336
00:33:30,404 --> 00:33:32,258
Charlotte?

337
00:33:33,558 --> 00:33:34,828
Charlotte?

338
00:33:36,927 --> 00:33:38,310
Charlotte.

339
00:33:41,147 --> 00:33:42,149
No.

340
00:34:10,677 --> 00:34:11,861
James!

341
00:34:13,362 --> 00:34:14,948
Can you hear me?!

342
00:34:17,085 --> 00:34:18,719
Can anyone hear me?!

343
00:34:26,792 --> 00:34:28,260
Who's there?

344
00:34:45,378 --> 00:34:46,730
Hello, John.

345
00:34:47,230 --> 00:34:48,448
You?

346
00:34:51,619 --> 00:34:53,571
What are you doing down here?

347
00:34:53,671 --> 00:34:56,323
I'm here to help you the rest of the way.

348
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:01,410
I don't-- I don't understand.

349
00:35:02,511 --> 00:35:04,513
You came to see me in the cabin.

350
00:35:05,014 --> 00:35:06,749
You asked me how to save the island,

351
00:35:06,851 --> 00:35:08,885
and I told you you had to move it.

352
00:35:10,586 --> 00:35:13,242
<i>I said that you had to move it, John.</i>

353
00:35:19,481 --> 00:35:21,899
But Ben said he knew how to do it.

354
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:25,636
He told me that I had to
stay here and lead his people.

355
00:35:27,337 --> 00:35:30,937
And since when did listening to him
get you anywhere worth a damn?

356
00:35:36,830 --> 00:35:38,315
The good news...

357
00:35:38,816 --> 00:35:40,752
is that you're here now.

358
00:35:42,251 --> 00:35:43,921
Are you ready to go?

359
00:35:44,021 --> 00:35:46,790
I-I d- I don't know...

360
00:35:46,890 --> 00:35:49,826
what to do once I get there.

361
00:35:49,927 --> 00:35:52,261
There's a woman living in Los Angeles.

362
00:35:52,862 --> 00:35:54,863
Now, once you got all of
your friends together,

363
00:35:54,964 --> 00:35:58,035
and it must be all of
them, every one who left.

364
00:35:58,135 --> 00:36:01,104
Once you persuaded them to join you,

365
00:36:01,205 --> 00:36:04,608
this woman will tell you
exactly how to come back.

366
00:36:05,909 --> 00:36:07,710
Who- who is she?

367
00:36:07,811 --> 00:36:10,814
Her name is Eloise Hawking.

368
00:36:11,915 --> 00:36:15,717
What if I can only convince
some of them to come back?

369
00:36:15,818 --> 00:36:17,837
I believe in you, John.

370
00:36:19,807 --> 00:36:21,809
You can do this.

371
00:36:25,911 --> 00:36:28,115
Richard said I was going to die.

372
00:36:30,317 --> 00:36:32,269
Well, I suppose that's-

373
00:36:32,369 --> 00:36:35,021
That's why they call it sacrifice.

374
00:36:44,430 --> 00:36:46,049
All right.

375
00:36:46,150 --> 00:36:47,183
Okay.

376
00:36:47,283 --> 00:36:49,935
Then I'm ready.

377
00:36:52,606 --> 00:36:54,273
Good.

378
00:36:56,343 --> 00:36:57,729
Now...

379
00:36:59,229 --> 00:37:01,264
On the other side of this column here

380
00:37:01,364 --> 00:37:04,168
is a wheel that slipped off its axis.

381
00:37:04,668 --> 00:37:08,455
And all you have to do
is give it a little push.

382
00:37:15,428 --> 00:37:18,148
Could-- could you help me up?

383
00:37:18,649 --> 00:37:19,849
No.

384
00:37:19,949 --> 00:37:21,733
Sorry, I can't.

385
00:37:48,329 --> 00:37:50,330
Aah! God!

386
00:38:00,674 --> 00:38:02,641
Good luck, John.

387
00:38:28,001 --> 00:38:30,154
Say hello to my son.

388
00:38:30,553 --> 00:38:33,473
Who's your son?

389
00:39:06,137 --> 00:39:07,340
May I?

390
00:39:14,214 --> 00:39:15,614
Take it.

391
00:39:25,624 --> 00:39:27,311
How do you have this?

392
00:39:27,411 --> 00:39:28,665
John gave it to me.

393
00:39:29,115 --> 00:39:31,113
You said John never came to see you.

394
00:39:31,214 --> 00:39:33,718
That's true, Jack.
I went to see him.

395
00:39:35,818 --> 00:39:37,755
Jin gave it to him
before he left the island.

396
00:39:37,855 --> 00:39:39,590
Why didn't Locke tell me himself?

397
00:39:39,690 --> 00:39:43,359
I don't know. Maybe he never
had a chance before he died.

398
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:47,047
I'm sorry I had to bring you here
before I gave it to you, Sun.

399
00:39:47,197 --> 00:39:50,301
But all those people back
on the island, Jin included,

400
00:39:50,701 --> 00:39:52,336
need our help.

401
00:39:53,737 --> 00:39:55,239
There is a woman in this church,

402
00:39:55,340 --> 00:39:57,775
<i>And she can tell us how to
get back to your husband.</i>

403
00:39:57,875 --> 00:39:59,743
But we're running out of time, Sun,

404
00:40:00,344 --> 00:40:02,211
so I need you to decide right now.

405
00:40:03,412 --> 00:40:05,332
Will you come with me?

406
00:40:14,308 --> 00:40:15,308
Yes.

407
00:40:18,478 --> 00:40:20,415
<i>What are you doin' here?</i>

408
00:40:31,924 --> 00:40:34,144
I assume the same thing you are.

409
00:40:34,744 --> 00:40:37,029
You're looking for Faraday's mother, too?

410
00:41:01,623 --> 00:41:03,123
Hello, Eloise.

411
00:41:13,667 --> 00:41:15,334
Hello, Benjamin.

412
00:41:21,174 --> 00:41:23,659
<i>I thought I said all of them.</i>

413
00:41:23,959 --> 00:41:26,580
This is all I could get on short notice.

414
00:41:29,549 --> 00:41:32,920
Well, I suppose it'll have to do for now.

415
00:41:36,656 --> 00:41:38,274
All right.

416
00:41:38,475 --> 00:41:40,276
Let's get started.

417
00:41:45,277 --> 00:41:48,489
