1
00:00:22,555 --> 00:00:23,357
Dude,
they'll find out.

2
00:00:24,057 --> 00:00:26,092
Not if we stick to the story.

3
00:00:26,192 --> 00:00:28,522
I don't know, Jack.
It could be a risk.

4
00:00:28,622 --> 00:00:30,657
It's the only way.
We have to do this.

5
00:00:31,757 --> 00:00:33,757
They're still at it, huh?

6
00:00:33,857 --> 00:00:35,122
Look, we're running out of time.

7
00:00:35,222 --> 00:00:37,292
We gotta make a decision now.

8
00:00:37,992 --> 00:00:40,192
So are we all okay with this?

9
00:00:40,692 --> 00:00:44,057
This is a decision that will
affect the rest of our lives.

10
00:00:44,157 --> 00:00:46,292
I'm not taking it lightly.

11
00:00:47,292 --> 00:00:48,457
Kate?

12
00:00:49,257 --> 00:00:50,722
Yeah.

13
00:00:50,822 --> 00:00:52,427
Sun?

14
00:00:56,287 --> 00:00:58,292
- Frank?
- What?

15
00:00:58,392 --> 00:01:01,342
Sorry you got dragged into this,
but we need to know that you're with us.

16
00:01:01,492 --> 00:01:04,022
Whatever you guys decide,
I'll just roll with.

17
00:01:05,422 --> 00:01:07,492
Hurley, what about you?

18
00:01:08,392 --> 00:01:10,557
I don't think we should lie, dude.

19
00:01:11,257 --> 00:01:14,622
We need to protect the people
that we left behind, Hurley.

20
00:01:14,722 --> 00:01:16,549
How does lying protect them?

21
00:01:16,649 --> 00:01:18,392
It protects them from Charles Widmore.

22
00:01:18,592 --> 00:01:20,557
The guy hired a boatload of
people to kill all of us.

23
00:01:20,657 --> 00:01:21,962
He faked a plane crash.

24
00:01:22,062 --> 00:01:23,174
I mean, do you think
telling him the truth,

25
00:01:23,274 --> 00:01:23,857
he's just gonna-

26
00:01:23,957 --> 00:01:25,857
he's gonna leave them alone?

27
00:01:26,757 --> 00:01:28,822
Look, he's your dad, right?

28
00:01:28,922 --> 00:01:31,057
Can't you, like... call him off?

29
00:01:31,257 --> 00:01:33,322
There's no calling my father off.

30
00:01:33,522 --> 00:01:34,553
But he'll never find them.

31
00:01:35,053 --> 00:01:36,422
I mean, the island disappeared.

32
00:01:36,522 --> 00:01:38,522
We all saw it. It's gone.

33
00:01:38,622 --> 00:01:40,457
Bloop!

34
00:01:41,057 --> 00:01:43,092
You think anyone's gonna believe that...

35
00:01:43,392 --> 00:01:45,357
Believe any of it?

36
00:01:45,457 --> 00:01:47,622
They're gonna think you're crazy.

37
00:01:48,422 --> 00:01:51,287
Not if someone backs me up.

38
00:01:53,757 --> 00:01:55,057
Sayid, come on.

39
00:01:55,357 --> 00:01:57,322
They'll think I'm nuts
if I tell the truth.

40
00:01:57,422 --> 00:01:58,957
But what if we all do?

41
00:01:59,057 --> 00:02:00,783
And if we can stick together,

42
00:02:00,883 --> 00:02:02,722
we can make them believe us.

43
00:02:03,522 --> 00:02:05,973
I don't want to spend the
rest of my life lying. Do you?

44
00:02:06,073 --> 00:02:07,257
No.

45
00:02:07,357 --> 00:02:08,622
But...

46
00:02:09,122 --> 00:02:11,487
I don't believe we have a better choice.

47
00:02:15,727 --> 00:02:18,557
I'm sorry, Hurley, but we have to lie.

48
00:02:20,587 --> 00:02:22,622
You know what, dude?

49
00:02:23,322 --> 00:02:25,422
I'm gonna remember this.

50
00:02:26,522 --> 00:02:28,157
And someday, you're gonna need my help,

51
00:02:28,257 --> 00:02:30,257
and I'm telling you right now...

52
00:02:32,057 --> 00:02:34,227
You're not gettin' it.

53
00:02:45,457 --> 00:02:47,392
Wake up, Sayid!

54
00:02:47,492 --> 00:02:49,357
Sayid!

55
00:02:49,457 --> 00:02:51,657
Sayid, wake up!

56
00:02:51,757 --> 00:02:53,087
Sayid!

57
00:03:13,687 --> 00:03:15,822
No, no, no, no, no! What do I do?!

58
00:03:17,822 --> 00:03:19,657
What am I supposed to do?!

59
00:03:30,987 --> 00:03:33,122
Okay, okay, okay.

60
00:03:33,222 --> 00:03:34,957
Just stay calm.

61
00:03:39,757 --> 00:03:42,227
What the hell were you thinking?

62
00:03:45,257 --> 00:03:47,922
- Ana Lucia?
- You were driving like a maniac.

63
00:03:48,022 --> 00:03:50,492
And why'd you pull over?

64
00:03:50,592 --> 00:03:52,857
I just... I-I thought--

65
00:03:52,957 --> 00:03:56,092
You didn't think.
What if I were real?

66
00:03:56,192 --> 00:03:58,457
What if a real cop stopped you?

67
00:03:58,757 --> 00:04:01,157
They already have pictures
of you covered in blood,

68
00:04:01,257 --> 00:04:04,092
- with a gun in your hand.
- Actually, it's ketchup.

69
00:04:04,192 --> 00:04:07,092
We went to a-a drive-thru, and, uh....

70
00:04:07,192 --> 00:04:10,057
Well, you need to pull it together.

71
00:04:10,157 --> 00:04:13,192
- You've got a lot of work to do.
- I do?

72
00:04:13,292 --> 00:04:17,016
Let's start with the basics.
First off, you need new clothes.

73
00:04:17,116 --> 00:04:19,357
Then you need to go to a safe place.

74
00:04:19,457 --> 00:04:21,957
And take Sayid to somebody you trust.

75
00:04:22,057 --> 00:04:24,722
- You getting all this?
- Yeah.

76
00:04:24,822 --> 00:04:26,722
Then get to it.

77
00:04:26,822 --> 00:04:28,887
And stay away from the cops.

78
00:04:30,687 --> 00:04:33,727
Do not get arrested.

79
00:04:35,457 --> 00:04:37,227
Thanks, Ana Lucia.

80
00:04:40,026 --> 00:04:42,656
Oh, yeah. Libby says hi.

81
00:05:13,776 --> 00:05:15,367
You really think that
thing's gonna work?

82
00:05:15,467 --> 00:05:16,587
Rose, I told you a hundred times.

83
00:05:16,796 --> 00:05:18,662
Of course it's gonna work.
Yes. I worked hard on it.

84
00:05:18,762 --> 00:05:20,217
It's better than rubbing
two sticks together.

85
00:05:20,357 --> 00:05:21,892
Well, I heard that's what
you're supposed to do with it.

86
00:05:21,992 --> 00:05:23,477
Yeah? Well, I think this is
gonna work better, all right?

87
00:05:23,577 --> 00:05:25,892
Well, I think you got too
much wood here in the inside.

88
00:05:25,992 --> 00:05:27,192
That's gonna smother the leaves.

89
00:05:27,292 --> 00:05:29,507
Rose, if you don't have enough wood,
the leaves just burn out.

90
00:05:29,757 --> 00:05:30,656
Fire?

91
00:05:31,457 --> 00:05:32,627
Who cares about fire?

92
00:05:33,156 --> 00:05:34,222
Any minute the sky could light up,

93
00:05:34,322 --> 00:05:36,291
and who the hell knows what
could happen this time?

94
00:05:36,392 --> 00:05:39,291
Neil, we are trying to focus
on what we can control.

95
00:05:39,392 --> 00:05:41,791
You are either gonna help or be quiet!

96
00:05:42,692 --> 00:05:44,957
- Whose shirt is this?
- It's mine.

97
00:05:45,457 --> 00:05:46,731
Can I have it?

98
00:05:46,831 --> 00:05:48,892
What does it matter?
We're all gonna be dead by sundown.

99
00:05:48,992 --> 00:05:51,392
I'll take that as a "yes," frogurt.

100
00:05:51,492 --> 00:05:53,227
- It's Neil.
- Yeah, yeah.

101
00:05:58,257 --> 00:05:59,921
Still in one piece?

102
00:06:00,022 --> 00:06:02,957
- As far as I can tell.
- I figured it would've disappeared

103
00:06:03,057 --> 00:06:04,518
with the rest of our stuff.

104
00:06:04,618 --> 00:06:06,492
I guess whatever we had
with us when we moved

105
00:06:06,592 --> 00:06:08,692
is along for the ride.

106
00:06:09,892 --> 00:06:11,757
What?

107
00:06:11,857 --> 00:06:13,957
Look who's back.

108
00:06:23,727 --> 00:06:25,291
Welcome back, Dr. wizard.

109
00:06:25,392 --> 00:06:27,691
- I think it's Mr. wizard.
- Shut up.

110
00:06:27,791 --> 00:06:29,892
You've been gone for two hours.
What the hell were you doing?

111
00:06:29,992 --> 00:06:32,522
Yeah, you're absolutely right.
I'm sorry.

112
00:06:32,622 --> 00:06:34,817
I... left my pack in the
jungle and I was coming back

113
00:06:34,917 --> 00:06:36,857
and I-I-I just--it was a
while before I realized

114
00:06:36,957 --> 00:06:38,992
that I was just...
uh, I was really lost.

115
00:06:39,392 --> 00:06:41,722
Well, you figure out when the
sky's gonna light up again?

116
00:06:42,822 --> 00:06:45,191
- I don't know.
- Well, you at least got a plan?

117
00:06:45,291 --> 00:06:47,892
I think we should take the zodiac,
head to a shipping lane.

118
00:06:47,992 --> 00:06:49,007
No. No, no, no.

119
00:06:49,107 --> 00:06:50,522
We can't just sail out on any course.

120
00:06:50,722 --> 00:06:53,092
For us to leave, I need to
calculate a new bearing,

121
00:06:53,192 --> 00:06:55,627
and, uh, to do that...

122
00:06:57,187 --> 00:07:00,026
I need to determine where we are now...

123
00:07:02,857 --> 00:07:04,357
in time.

124
00:07:04,757 --> 00:07:06,992
And what are the rest
of us supposed to do?

125
00:07:07,492 --> 00:07:09,237
I'm gonna go find us something to eat.

126
00:07:09,637 --> 00:07:11,592
And how are you planning on doing that?

127
00:07:11,892 --> 00:07:14,557
Don't worry about it.

128
00:07:16,357 --> 00:07:19,022
I guess we'll get the water.

129
00:07:19,122 --> 00:07:20,622
Dude, wake up!

130
00:07:20,722 --> 00:07:22,786
Come on. I can't do this on my own!

131
00:07:26,687 --> 00:07:28,687
I promise I'll pay you back.

132
00:07:36,857 --> 00:07:38,526
Wait right here.

133
00:08:00,087 --> 00:08:01,357
Shih tzus?

134
00:08:01,457 --> 00:08:03,057
I like shih tzus.

135
00:08:03,156 --> 00:08:05,656
It looks like you "heart" them.

136
00:08:05,757 --> 00:08:07,892
Rough night?

137
00:08:07,992 --> 00:08:10,122
Yeah.

138
00:08:10,222 --> 00:08:12,357
Your friend's pretty wasted.

139
00:08:12,457 --> 00:08:13,622
Yeah.

140
00:08:13,722 --> 00:08:16,587
I know you from somewhere, don't I?

141
00:08:19,786 --> 00:08:22,222
- No.
- I think I do.

142
00:08:22,322 --> 00:08:25,892
- Yeah, you definitely look familiar.
- I just have one of those faces.

143
00:08:25,992 --> 00:08:27,727
You're lying.

144
00:08:30,357 --> 00:08:32,722
I don't believe in lying.

145
00:08:33,021 --> 00:08:35,021
I remember!

146
00:08:36,122 --> 00:08:38,421
You're the guy who won the lottery...

147
00:08:38,521 --> 00:08:40,892
And you crashed in that plane.

148
00:08:41,491 --> 00:08:45,421
- No. I must look like him.
- You're him. Hey! Buy a ticket here.

149
00:08:45,521 --> 00:08:48,156
If you win, we get a commission.
You're good luck.

150
00:08:48,257 --> 00:08:50,987
Sorry. Wrong dude. Keep the change.

151
00:08:57,427 --> 00:08:58,827
Okay.

152
00:09:01,687 --> 00:09:03,787
Okay, we're outta here.

153
00:09:30,757 --> 00:09:33,427
Mommy, I wanna go home.

154
00:09:35,727 --> 00:09:37,656
Look at your book, baby.

155
00:10:11,887 --> 00:10:13,257
Hello?

156
00:10:17,387 --> 00:10:19,922
I-I can't believe it's you.

157
00:10:20,221 --> 00:10:22,257
No. Hi.

158
00:10:22,357 --> 00:10:23,956
How are you?

159
00:10:26,627 --> 00:10:28,557
Wait, you're in L.A.?

160
00:10:30,456 --> 00:10:32,456
Of course I can meet, yeah. What...

161
00:10:32,857 --> 00:10:35,287
I know exactly where that is.
I'll be there in half an hour.

162
00:10:36,787 --> 00:10:38,622
Mommy, where are we going?

163
00:10:39,221 --> 00:10:41,327
To see a friend.

164
00:11:19,627 --> 00:11:22,426
Are you looking for your pills, Jack?

165
00:11:25,987 --> 00:11:28,326
I flushed them down the toilet.

166
00:11:34,156 --> 00:11:35,557
Thank you.

167
00:11:35,656 --> 00:11:37,622
I was just gonna do that myself.

168
00:11:37,721 --> 00:11:39,587
Yeah, I figured you were.

169
00:11:41,287 --> 00:11:42,692
Going somewhere?

170
00:11:42,791 --> 00:11:44,321
I'm checking out.

171
00:11:44,422 --> 00:11:46,091
Where are we going?

172
00:11:46,192 --> 00:11:50,192
You're going home.
And find yourself a suitcase.

173
00:11:50,291 --> 00:11:52,656
If there's anything in
this life you want,

174
00:11:52,757 --> 00:11:55,057
pack it in there...

175
00:11:55,156 --> 00:11:57,557
Because you're never coming back.

176
00:12:03,956 --> 00:12:05,491
Good.

177
00:12:06,692 --> 00:12:08,122
Good.

178
00:12:08,621 --> 00:12:10,557
I'll pick you up in six hours.

179
00:12:10,656 --> 00:12:12,456
And where will you be going?

180
00:12:12,557 --> 00:12:15,091
John's casket is
outside in a carpet van.

181
00:12:15,192 --> 00:12:17,627
I need to move it somewhere safe.

182
00:12:20,227 --> 00:12:22,091
Safe?

183
00:12:23,192 --> 00:12:25,127
He's dead, isn't he?

184
00:12:27,327 --> 00:12:29,787
I'll see you in six hours, Jack.

185
00:13:00,087 --> 00:13:02,821
<i>previously on "Expos?...</i>

186
00:13:02,922 --> 00:13:04,956
<i>It looks like the
scorpion is taking over</i>

187
00:13:05,057 --> 00:13:07,022
<i>All the cobra's business.</i>

188
00:13:07,122 --> 00:13:09,057
<i>You want me to work with tsunami,</i>

189
00:13:09,156 --> 00:13:10,856
<i>- the dragon lady of van nuys?</i>
- Yeah.

190
00:13:10,956 --> 00:13:12,492
<i>I'm here to capture the scorpion,</i>

191
00:13:12,591 --> 00:13:14,822
<i>so if you've got a problem with
that, you can go work stage 3.</i>

192
00:13:16,622 --> 00:13:18,127
<i>She's hit!</i>

193
00:13:36,287 --> 00:13:37,527
Hey, dad.

194
00:13:39,887 --> 00:13:41,686
How's it going?

195
00:13:44,047 --> 00:13:44,847
...the news?

196
00:13:44,947 --> 00:13:47,677
No. I just got up.
Why, are you wanted again?

197
00:13:47,787 --> 00:13:49,416
Uh, yeah. Kind of.

198
00:13:49,517 --> 00:13:51,997
- Is mom here?
- No, she's out shopping.

199
00:13:52,096 --> 00:13:53,307
Hey, set him over here.

200
00:13:55,987 --> 00:13:57,951
- Oh, man, he's out.
- Is he... breathing?

201
00:13:58,352 --> 00:14:00,382
Barely.
What happened?

202
00:14:00,481 --> 00:14:01,960
- He got shot by a dart.
- A dart?

203
00:14:02,061 --> 00:14:03,816
What, were you in the zoo or something?

204
00:14:03,917 --> 00:14:06,517
- No, we were at the safe house.
- The safe house?

205
00:14:06,617 --> 00:14:08,552
Sayid took me there to protect me.

206
00:14:08,652 --> 00:14:10,916
Then these two guys jumped at him,
they shot him with darts,

207
00:14:11,016 --> 00:14:12,774
and now he's-
he's in a coma or... something.

208
00:14:12,875 --> 00:14:13,981
Hugo, this doesn't make sense.

209
00:14:14,082 --> 00:14:16,082
And what are you doing out
of the mental institution?

210
00:14:16,282 --> 00:14:18,352
Sayid pulled me out.
I'm in danger. We both are.

211
00:14:18,552 --> 00:14:20,552
Danger from who?

212
00:14:21,852 --> 00:14:23,917
I'm not sure exactly.

213
00:14:29,246 --> 00:14:30,416
Hello?

214
00:14:30,517 --> 00:14:31,782
<i>Mr. and Mrs. Reyes?</i>

215
00:14:31,882 --> 00:14:34,616
<i>L.A.P.D.
Can you open the gate, please?</i>

216
00:14:35,417 --> 00:14:36,916
Just what kind of trouble are you in?

217
00:14:37,066 --> 00:14:38,816
Dad, please!
Just don't tell 'em I'm here!

218
00:14:40,817 --> 00:14:43,147
All right, but then you're
gonna tell me the truth.

219
00:14:49,816 --> 00:14:52,247
<i>Well, give us a call
if you hear anything.</i>

220
00:15:02,717 --> 00:15:04,681
You killed three people?

221
00:15:04,782 --> 00:15:07,116
- No. Sayid did.
- Oh. Well, that's better.

222
00:15:07,217 --> 00:15:09,581
Come on. Let's get him to the couch.

223
00:15:09,681 --> 00:15:10,681
He saved me.

224
00:15:10,782 --> 00:15:12,552
I think we should call
a lawyer right now.

225
00:15:12,652 --> 00:15:16,181
No, no, no. We can't go public.
They're after us.

226
00:15:16,282 --> 00:15:18,216
Who? Who is after you?

227
00:15:18,316 --> 00:15:21,282
I don't know.
Sayid knows. He can explain.

228
00:15:21,382 --> 00:15:23,316
Sayid ain't explaining nothing.

229
00:15:23,417 --> 00:15:25,681
We need to get him to a hospital.

230
00:15:25,782 --> 00:15:28,252
Did you not hear me?
People are trying to kill us.

231
00:15:28,352 --> 00:15:30,052
We go to a hospital, they'll find us!

232
00:15:30,152 --> 00:15:32,717
Like--like "The Godfather."
It's the last place you go.

233
00:15:32,817 --> 00:15:34,971
Everyone knows it.
They-- they smother you with pillows

234
00:15:35,071 --> 00:15:36,047
and make it look like an accident.

235
00:15:36,297 --> 00:15:37,637
Sayid, please wake up!

236
00:15:37,777 --> 00:15:39,947
That's not gonna work. We need a doctor.

237
00:15:41,797 --> 00:15:43,497
I think I know what to do.

238
00:15:50,986 --> 00:15:53,496
Mommy, mommy, can I push the button?

239
00:15:53,996 --> 00:15:55,381
Sure you can, sweetie.

240
00:15:55,482 --> 00:15:56,947
But we're all the way to the top, okay?

241
00:15:57,047 --> 00:16:00,347
So I want you to press
number 3-1. You see it?

242
00:16:00,447 --> 00:16:02,896
You see it? Okay. You get it. 3-1.

243
00:16:02,996 --> 00:16:05,296
Yeah! That's the one!

244
00:16:05,396 --> 00:16:07,547
You pressed it! You pressed it!

245
00:16:27,496 --> 00:16:29,236
Hi.

246
00:16:31,637 --> 00:16:33,396
Hello, Kate.

247
00:16:48,402 --> 00:16:49,347
Have a nice day.

248
00:16:49,447 --> 00:16:51,396
I'll be right with you.

249
00:16:57,942 --> 00:16:59,757
Hello, Ben.

250
00:17:02,947 --> 00:17:06,087
If it's the porterhouse you're
looking for, we're out.

251
00:17:07,777 --> 00:17:09,447
No, no porterhouse.

252
00:17:09,547 --> 00:17:12,172
I do, however, have something
very important in my van, Jill,

253
00:17:12,272 --> 00:17:13,896
and I need you to watch it for me.

254
00:17:13,996 --> 00:17:16,616
- Is it what I think it is?
- It is.

255
00:17:18,146 --> 00:17:20,447
He'll be safe with me.

256
00:17:20,547 --> 00:17:22,021
- Have Gabriel and
Jeffrey checked in yet?

257
00:17:22,121 --> 00:17:22,252
Yeah,

258
00:17:22,352 --> 00:17:23,812
everything's moving right on schedule.

259
00:17:23,912 --> 00:17:26,382
- How's it going with Shephard?
- He's with us.

260
00:17:26,482 --> 00:17:28,722
Really? What'd you do,
bribe him with some pills?

261
00:17:28,822 --> 00:17:30,312
Cut the man some slack.

262
00:17:30,412 --> 00:17:32,817
He's been through a lot.
We all have.

263
00:17:33,646 --> 00:17:36,046
Right. Of course.

264
00:17:36,146 --> 00:17:37,582
Sorry.

265
00:17:37,682 --> 00:17:39,811
So keep him safe, Jill.

266
00:17:40,011 --> 00:17:42,046
Because if you don't...

267
00:17:43,146 --> 00:17:45,312
everything we're about to do...

268
00:17:45,412 --> 00:17:47,477
won't matter at all.

269
00:18:01,696 --> 00:18:04,146
Oh, you got it! You got it! You got it!

270
00:18:04,247 --> 00:18:07,546
- You got it. You got it.
<i>- All right! Finally we got-</i>

271
00:18:08,496 --> 00:18:09,748
Why did you do that?

272
00:18:09,848 --> 00:18:11,346
Because you're supposed
to fan the flame, Rose.

273
00:18:11,446 --> 00:18:12,996
I thought you said you
knew how to start a fire.

274
00:18:13,096 --> 00:18:14,846
And I thought you said you didn't care.

275
00:18:14,946 --> 00:18:15,896
I care about surviving.

276
00:18:16,396 --> 00:18:19,997
I think you need to
take a time-out, Neil.

277
00:18:21,617 --> 00:18:23,612
- You'll get it, Bernard. You will.
- Yeah. All right.

278
00:18:23,712 --> 00:18:26,076
Just- just try again.

279
00:18:29,417 --> 00:18:31,346
Give me one second.

280
00:18:32,346 --> 00:18:33,777
I got you something.

281
00:18:36,017 --> 00:18:37,198
I found these in the jungle.

282
00:18:37,298 --> 00:18:38,848
- Look at that. Thank you.
- There was only two,

283
00:18:38,948 --> 00:18:41,697
but I thought we could both
do with a bite to eat.

284
00:18:41,797 --> 00:18:43,746
Thank you very much, very much.

285
00:18:45,917 --> 00:18:47,612
You all right?

286
00:18:48,111 --> 00:18:50,616
I just can't seem to shake
this bloody headache.

287
00:18:54,976 --> 00:18:57,112
Well... I'm sure it'll pass.

288
00:18:57,212 --> 00:18:59,081
No, it's not just that.

289
00:18:59,782 --> 00:19:02,747
It's the weirdest thing.
Earlier, I was...

290
00:19:03,447 --> 00:19:05,546
I was thinking about my mom,

291
00:19:05,646 --> 00:19:09,812
and all of sudden, I-I couldn't
remember her maiden name.

292
00:19:09,912 --> 00:19:10,923
I mean, isn't that odd?

293
00:19:11,023 --> 00:19:12,322
Don't worry about it.

294
00:19:12,422 --> 00:19:17,576
Listen, all of us have been
under a lot of stress. Okay?

295
00:19:21,097 --> 00:19:23,312
Daniel...

296
00:19:23,412 --> 00:19:25,716
Do you know what's happening to me?

297
00:19:28,747 --> 00:19:30,177
Dinner!

298
00:19:36,117 --> 00:19:38,511
That's great! Wow! Where'd you get that?

299
00:19:38,612 --> 00:19:40,247
I found it.

300
00:19:40,847 --> 00:19:43,146
What do you mean you "found" it?

301
00:19:43,247 --> 00:19:45,816
It died in the jungle. I found it.

302
00:19:46,286 --> 00:19:49,617
Don't worry. It's fine. It's
only been dead three hours.

303
00:19:50,337 --> 00:19:51,802
What?

304
00:19:51,902 --> 00:19:53,247
Who's got a knife?

305
00:19:53,447 --> 00:19:55,497
A knife? You need a knife?

306
00:19:55,597 --> 00:19:58,296
Oh, it's over by the
Cuisinart next to the stove.

307
00:19:58,396 --> 00:19:59,396
What's your problem?

308
00:19:59,497 --> 00:20:01,247
My problem is, we don't have a knife.

309
00:20:01,347 --> 00:20:03,362
W-we don't have anything.

310
00:20:03,462 --> 00:20:05,146
And it wouldn't even matter if we did,

311
00:20:05,247 --> 00:20:07,096
'cause Bernie the dentist
can't even start a fire.

312
00:20:07,196 --> 00:20:08,296
Hey, ease up there, Frogurt.

313
00:20:08,396 --> 00:20:10,447
It's Neil, you inbred.

314
00:20:10,547 --> 00:20:12,291
And I'm not gonna ease up,

315
00:20:12,391 --> 00:20:14,896
'cause I'm tired and I'm
hungry and I'm screwed!

316
00:20:14,997 --> 00:20:16,611
- We're all screwed!
- Calm down, Neil.

317
00:20:16,712 --> 00:20:17,547
We're gonna get through this.

318
00:20:17,647 --> 00:20:18,961
How are any of us gonna
get through this?!

319
00:20:19,061 --> 00:20:22,157
Did you hear what I just said?!
We can't even get fire!

320
00:20:27,997 --> 00:20:29,326
Run!

321
00:21:02,297 --> 00:21:05,996
Come on! Split up!
Everybody, get to the creek!

322
00:21:09,427 --> 00:21:11,732
Ow! Dan!

323
00:21:13,431 --> 00:21:15,267
Keep moving!

324
00:21:31,546 --> 00:21:33,506
- Come on. He's dead.
- No...

325
00:21:33,612 --> 00:21:35,546
Come on! You wanna be dead, too?!
Come on!

326
00:21:37,407 --> 00:21:40,177
There's nothing you could have done.
We gotta go now!

327
00:21:46,346 --> 00:21:48,698
Dude, the cops are on a stakeout?

328
00:21:48,798 --> 00:21:50,441
You just escaped from
a mental institution.

329
00:21:50,542 --> 00:21:52,042
There's dead bodies everywhere!

330
00:21:52,142 --> 00:21:53,642
Of course they're on a stakeout!

331
00:21:53,742 --> 00:21:56,298
They think you're crazy
enough to come back home.

332
00:22:00,446 --> 00:22:03,346
S-so are you...

333
00:22:03,446 --> 00:22:04,777
Crazy?

334
00:22:08,846 --> 00:22:10,877
Do you think I am?

335
00:22:12,147 --> 00:22:14,576
Well, either that or you're lying to me.

336
00:22:20,316 --> 00:22:21,396
I'm not crazy,

337
00:22:21,996 --> 00:22:24,516
and I have a really good
reason why I'm lying to you.

338
00:22:26,877 --> 00:22:28,946
Well, what is it?

339
00:22:32,247 --> 00:22:36,347
Why is there a dead
Pakistani on my couch?!

340
00:22:38,147 --> 00:22:39,616
He's not dead, ma.

341
00:22:39,717 --> 00:22:41,282
Well, he's not breathing.

342
00:22:41,382 --> 00:22:43,087
He's not?!

343
00:22:45,086 --> 00:22:47,081
It's okay, Carmen. We have a plan.

344
00:22:47,482 --> 00:22:50,017
A plan? What are you talking about?

345
00:22:50,617 --> 00:22:53,052
He is breathing... kind of.
Dad, we gotta go now.

346
00:22:53,152 --> 00:22:54,346
Hugo, what's happening?

347
00:22:54,446 --> 00:22:55,246
Mom, please!

348
00:22:55,321 --> 00:22:59,052
No "mom, please" me!
Why are you all over the news?

349
00:22:59,152 --> 00:23:00,532
Do you know what they
are telling about you?

350
00:23:00,632 --> 00:23:02,017
Yeah, mom. I know.

351
00:23:02,117 --> 00:23:03,652
Look, everything's gonna
make sense. I promise.

352
00:23:03,752 --> 00:23:05,316
It better!

353
00:23:19,186 --> 00:23:21,247
Officers.

354
00:23:26,647 --> 00:23:29,152
So how long are you in L.A.?

355
00:23:29,252 --> 00:23:30,782
Just a few days.

356
00:23:30,882 --> 00:23:33,137
I have some business to attend to.

357
00:23:33,237 --> 00:23:35,451
But I wanted to see you.

358
00:23:36,552 --> 00:23:37,772
Here it is.

359
00:23:37,872 --> 00:23:41,042
Her name's Ji Yeon.
Here's a baby picture.

360
00:23:41,452 --> 00:23:43,687
Oh! She's beautiful.

361
00:23:43,787 --> 00:23:47,251
Thank you. She's with
her grandmother in Seoul.

362
00:23:47,552 --> 00:23:49,887
I hope some day you get to meet her.

363
00:23:49,987 --> 00:23:53,352
It would be nice to see her
and Aaron play together.

364
00:23:54,051 --> 00:23:55,357
Yeah.

365
00:23:57,316 --> 00:23:59,487
Kate? Are you all right?

366
00:24:00,186 --> 00:24:02,222
Yeah. I'm fine.

367
00:24:03,122 --> 00:24:05,017
Are you?

368
00:24:15,757 --> 00:24:17,951
Somebody knows we're lying.

369
00:24:18,352 --> 00:24:19,621
What?

370
00:24:19,722 --> 00:24:21,587
Some lawyers came to see me.

371
00:24:21,687 --> 00:24:22,621
Who?

372
00:24:22,722 --> 00:24:24,921
Two men. They came to my house

373
00:24:25,021 --> 00:24:26,952
and they asked for a blood sample.

374
00:24:27,052 --> 00:24:28,622
Some kind of lawsuit.

375
00:24:28,722 --> 00:24:31,321
They wanted to test to see if...

376
00:24:31,921 --> 00:24:34,852
To see if Aaron's my son.

377
00:24:35,952 --> 00:24:38,222
Who did these lawyers represent?

378
00:24:38,322 --> 00:24:41,756
I don't know. They wouldn't
tell me who their client is.

379
00:24:43,757 --> 00:24:46,352
Then they're not interested
in exposing the lie.

380
00:24:46,852 --> 00:24:48,422
How do you know?

381
00:24:48,522 --> 00:24:50,922
Because if they were,
they would just do it.

382
00:24:51,022 --> 00:24:53,022
They wouldn't come to you in private.

383
00:24:53,122 --> 00:24:55,951
They don't care that we're lying.
They just want Aaron.

384
00:24:56,051 --> 00:24:59,051
But who... who would do that? We--

385
00:24:59,152 --> 00:25:02,122
I don't know, but you
need to take care of them.

386
00:25:02,721 --> 00:25:05,152
What do you mean, "take care of them?"

387
00:25:05,652 --> 00:25:08,022
Wouldn't you do anything you had to

388
00:25:08,122 --> 00:25:10,057
in order to keep Aaron?

389
00:25:13,287 --> 00:25:16,357
What kind of a person do you think I am?

390
00:25:23,616 --> 00:25:25,422
Jin! Jin!

391
00:25:25,522 --> 00:25:29,852
The kind of person who makes
hard decisions when she has to.

392
00:25:29,952 --> 00:25:32,522
You get the baby on the chopper.
I'll get Jin.

393
00:25:33,522 --> 00:25:35,987
Like you did on the freighter.

394
00:25:40,216 --> 00:25:43,451
You told me to get on the helicopter,
and you said you'd get Jin.

395
00:25:43,552 --> 00:25:45,422
We gotta get outta here!

396
00:25:46,022 --> 00:25:48,386
Sun, I hope you don't think...

397
00:25:48,487 --> 00:25:51,021
But you did what you had to do.

398
00:25:52,322 --> 00:25:53,957
And if you hadn't...

399
00:25:54,956 --> 00:25:59,087
we probably all would've died
instead of just my husband.

400
00:26:05,716 --> 00:26:07,352
I'm sorry.

401
00:26:08,852 --> 00:26:11,487
I'm so sorry. I...

402
00:26:13,287 --> 00:26:15,117
I don't blame you.

403
00:26:22,987 --> 00:26:24,786
So...

404
00:26:24,886 --> 00:26:26,816
How's Jack?

405
00:26:30,656 --> 00:26:32,652
Hugo said I could trust you.

406
00:26:32,752 --> 00:26:35,652
I wasn't so sure,
but he swore I could, so...

407
00:26:36,352 --> 00:26:38,086
Can I?

408
00:26:38,187 --> 00:26:39,552
Yes. Of course.

409
00:26:39,652 --> 00:26:40,586
All right.

410
00:26:47,586 --> 00:26:49,452
What happened to him?

411
00:26:49,552 --> 00:26:51,886
Hugo said he got hit with some dart.

412
00:26:51,987 --> 00:26:54,052
Must've been some drugs or something.

413
00:26:54,152 --> 00:26:57,151
- And where is Hurley right now?
- At our house, freaking out.

414
00:26:57,251 --> 00:26:59,186
Let me get my car.
Help me move him over.

415
00:26:59,287 --> 00:27:01,222
I'm gonna have to get
him to the hospital.

416
00:27:01,322 --> 00:27:03,486
No. No, H-Hugo said
that whoever did this,

417
00:27:03,587 --> 00:27:04,616
they'll come back after him.

418
00:27:04,717 --> 00:27:06,601
All due respect, Mr. Reyes,
but you brought him to me,

419
00:27:06,702 --> 00:27:08,350
so I'm gonna do what I
think is best for Sayid.

420
00:27:08,450 --> 00:27:10,476
All right, fine.
Take him to the hospital.

421
00:27:10,576 --> 00:27:12,552
But with all due respect
to you, Dr. Shephard,

422
00:27:12,652 --> 00:27:14,788
when this is over,
you're gonna do something for me.

423
00:27:14,888 --> 00:27:15,551
What?

424
00:27:15,651 --> 00:27:16,787
Stay away from Hugo.

425
00:27:17,886 --> 00:27:19,476
Whatever it is you talked him into,
something tells me

426
00:27:19,576 --> 00:27:21,951
you don't have his best
interests at heart.

427
00:27:22,051 --> 00:27:24,017
So stay away from my son.

428
00:27:36,817 --> 00:27:38,621
<i>Hello?</i>

429
00:27:38,721 --> 00:27:39,722
Ben...

430
00:27:39,822 --> 00:27:42,651
You'll never guess who
just showed up at my door.

431
00:27:42,951 --> 00:27:44,052
Who?

432
00:27:45,052 --> 00:27:46,656
Sayid.

433
00:28:00,817 --> 00:28:01,877
Who is Sayid?

434
00:28:02,447 --> 00:28:04,451
I thought he was your friend.

435
00:28:04,552 --> 00:28:06,117
He is my friend...

436
00:28:06,516 --> 00:28:08,181
But he's also got this double life

437
00:28:08,281 --> 00:28:10,481
where he does crazy
ninja moves and spy stuff.

438
00:28:10,782 --> 00:28:12,681
But he's a good guy.

439
00:28:12,782 --> 00:28:15,052
A good guy doesn't kill three men.

440
00:28:15,152 --> 00:28:17,082
A good guy doesn't kill any men.

441
00:28:17,182 --> 00:28:19,582
- Mom.
- Don't "mom" me.

442
00:28:20,481 --> 00:28:23,052
You are in terrible trouble, Hugo.

443
00:28:23,152 --> 00:28:25,552
The news thinks you did this.

444
00:28:25,652 --> 00:28:29,082
And if the news does, everyone does.

445
00:28:29,681 --> 00:28:31,851
Why is this happening?

446
00:28:31,951 --> 00:28:34,887
How can anybody want to hurt you?

447
00:28:40,647 --> 00:28:42,046
I don't know.

448
00:28:47,346 --> 00:28:49,947
Tell your mother the truth.

449
00:28:55,217 --> 00:28:56,987
We lied, ma.

450
00:29:00,616 --> 00:29:02,352
What do you mean, you lied?

451
00:29:02,452 --> 00:29:04,352
All of us - the Oceanic Six,

452
00:29:04,452 --> 00:29:07,051
we lied about what
happened after the crash.

453
00:29:09,052 --> 00:29:11,147
And what did happen?

454
00:29:18,317 --> 00:29:19,752
Okay.

455
00:29:20,652 --> 00:29:22,616
See, we did crash,

456
00:29:23,017 --> 00:29:25,316
but it was on this crazy island.

457
00:29:25,616 --> 00:29:27,981
And we waited for rescue,
and there wasn't any rescue.

458
00:29:28,082 --> 00:29:29,951
And there was a smoke monster,

459
00:29:30,052 --> 00:29:31,681
and then there were other
people on the island.

460
00:29:31,782 --> 00:29:34,216
We called them The Others,
and they started attacking us.

461
00:29:35,116 --> 00:29:36,552
And we found some hatches,

462
00:29:36,652 --> 00:29:39,981
and there was a button you had
to push every 108 minutes or...

463
00:29:41,082 --> 00:29:43,451
Well, I was never really clear on that.

464
00:29:43,552 --> 00:29:46,241
But... The Others didn't have
anything to do with the hatches.

465
00:29:46,341 --> 00:29:48,902
That was the Dharma Initiative,
but they were all dead.

466
00:29:49,052 --> 00:29:51,481
The Others killed them,
and now they're trying to kill us.

467
00:29:51,582 --> 00:29:53,351
And then we teamed up with the Others,

468
00:29:53,452 --> 00:29:55,517
because some worse people
were coming on a freighter.

469
00:29:55,617 --> 00:29:58,417
Desmond's girlfriend's
father sent them to kill us.

470
00:29:58,817 --> 00:30:00,251
So we stole their helicopter

471
00:30:00,352 --> 00:30:02,316
and we flew it to their
freighter, but it blew up.

472
00:30:02,616 --> 00:30:04,717
And we couldn't go back to the island
because it disappeared.

473
00:30:04,817 --> 00:30:06,382
So then we crashed into the ocean,

474
00:30:06,981 --> 00:30:08,082
and we floated there for a while

475
00:30:08,182 --> 00:30:10,166
until a boat came and picked us up.

476
00:30:10,266 --> 00:30:13,147
And by then, there were six of us.
That part was true.

477
00:30:21,287 --> 00:30:22,347
But the...

478
00:30:27,017 --> 00:30:29,381
But the rest of the people...

479
00:30:31,782 --> 00:30:33,746
who were on the plane,

480
00:30:36,117 --> 00:30:38,587
they're still on that island.

481
00:30:53,186 --> 00:30:55,846
I believe you.

482
00:31:00,616 --> 00:31:02,882
I don't understand you,

483
00:31:02,982 --> 00:31:04,917
but I believe you.

484
00:31:10,417 --> 00:31:13,017
A lot of people died, ma.

485
00:31:15,386 --> 00:31:19,147
And now this bad stuff
is happening because...

486
00:31:25,747 --> 00:31:27,717
We shouldn't have lied.

487
00:31:38,087 --> 00:31:39,581
You okay?

488
00:31:39,682 --> 00:31:42,351
Yeah, I'm fine.
I just stepped on something.

489
00:31:42,452 --> 00:31:44,287
Something jammed...

490
00:31:49,647 --> 00:31:52,051
Son of a bitch.

491
00:31:52,152 --> 00:31:54,051
We should keep moving.

492
00:31:54,152 --> 00:31:56,516
We gotta hook up with
everybody at the creek.

493
00:31:56,616 --> 00:31:57,987
It's a long creek, James.
Which part?

494
00:31:58,087 --> 00:31:59,451
I don't know. The wet part.

495
00:31:59,551 --> 00:32:01,487
Sorry if my plan's not
up to others' stan--

496
00:32:36,886 --> 00:32:39,382
Who were those people?
Are they yours?

497
00:32:39,482 --> 00:32:40,896
Did they shoot the arrows?

498
00:32:40,997 --> 00:32:42,516
You want me to crawl
out there and ask 'em?

499
00:32:43,016 --> 00:32:45,117
You don't have to be a wiseass.
I'm just trying--

500
00:32:56,486 --> 00:32:59,416
What are you doing on our island?!

501
00:33:50,356 --> 00:33:51,487
Son of a bitch.

502
00:33:51,687 --> 00:33:53,622
Come on, Sayid.

503
00:33:54,121 --> 00:33:55,487
Come on.

504
00:33:58,987 --> 00:34:00,386
Sayid.

505
00:34:00,987 --> 00:34:03,287
It--it's... it's Jack.

506
00:34:06,717 --> 00:34:08,352
It's okay. It's all right.

507
00:34:08,452 --> 00:34:11,316
You're okay. You're all right.

508
00:34:21,387 --> 00:34:22,987
What happened?

509
00:34:24,186 --> 00:34:28,622
You're fine.
You're in the hospital.

510
00:34:28,722 --> 00:34:30,951
Hurley's father brought you to me.

511
00:34:31,052 --> 00:34:32,787
Hurley's father?

512
00:34:35,656 --> 00:34:37,952
Sayid, you've been attacked.

513
00:34:38,652 --> 00:34:40,286
Where's Hurley?

514
00:34:40,386 --> 00:34:42,221
He's at his parents' house.

515
00:34:42,322 --> 00:34:43,687
Who's with him?

516
00:34:43,886 --> 00:34:46,422
I don't know. His mother, maybe?

517
00:34:46,921 --> 00:34:49,087
Does anyone else know he's there?

518
00:35:01,856 --> 00:35:03,586
Hello, Hugo.

519
00:35:05,857 --> 00:35:07,386
Get away from me.

520
00:35:07,487 --> 00:35:08,621
Get away!

521
00:35:08,721 --> 00:35:10,521
Hugo, I know you're in trouble,

522
00:35:11,622 --> 00:35:14,087
and I can assure you I've
taken care of everything.

523
00:35:15,656 --> 00:35:17,751
I have a car waiting for us out back.

524
00:35:17,852 --> 00:35:19,352
The police didn't see me come in.

525
00:35:19,552 --> 00:35:21,421
I can get you out of here.

526
00:35:22,422 --> 00:35:23,822
No way, dude.

527
00:35:24,221 --> 00:35:25,886
Sayid warned me about you.

528
00:35:25,987 --> 00:35:28,621
I'm taking you to Sayid. He's with Jack.

529
00:35:28,722 --> 00:35:31,117
That's why I'm here, Hugo.
Jack called me.

530
00:35:33,557 --> 00:35:36,287
How else would I know
that they're together?

531
00:35:38,386 --> 00:35:39,551
No.

532
00:35:39,952 --> 00:35:42,321
You're--you're playing
one of your mind games.

533
00:35:42,422 --> 00:35:44,051
They would never trust you.

534
00:35:44,152 --> 00:35:48,621
In their defense, I'm not
an easy person to trust.

535
00:35:48,722 --> 00:35:50,221
But they came around

536
00:35:50,322 --> 00:35:53,787
when they realized that we
all want the same thing.

537
00:35:55,956 --> 00:35:57,787
And what's that?

538
00:35:58,587 --> 00:36:01,216
To go back to the island.

539
00:36:05,157 --> 00:36:07,387
Come with us, Hugo...

540
00:36:07,986 --> 00:36:09,986
and this'll be over.
You can stop hiding.

541
00:36:10,087 --> 00:36:13,947
You can stop worrying about the stories
and the deceptions.

542
00:36:15,321 --> 00:36:17,286
If you come with me,

543
00:36:17,386 --> 00:36:20,087
you won't ever have to lie again.

544
00:36:29,256 --> 00:36:30,887
Please.

545
00:36:34,056 --> 00:36:35,717
Let me help you.

546
00:36:47,986 --> 00:36:49,817
Never, dude.

547
00:36:51,657 --> 00:36:54,686
Hey! Hey, you got me!

548
00:36:54,787 --> 00:36:56,951
That's right, you got me! That's right!
I'm the killer!

549
00:36:57,052 --> 00:36:57,951
Stop! police!

550
00:36:58,051 --> 00:37:00,025
Face your back towards me!
Slowly drop down to your knees!

551
00:37:00,125 --> 00:37:01,357
I'm the murderer, I killed four people.

552
00:37:02,151 --> 00:37:03,052
Three people.

553
00:37:03,152 --> 00:37:05,286
However many are dead, I
killed them. I killed them.

554
00:37:05,386 --> 00:37:08,521
I killed them all. J-just--
just get me away from here.

555
00:37:09,522 --> 00:37:11,237
<i>You have the right to remain silent.</i>

556
00:37:11,337 --> 00:37:13,786
<i>Anything you say can and will be used
against you in a court of law.</i>

557
00:37:13,887 --> 00:37:15,292
<i>- You have the right to
speak to an attorney</i>

558
00:37:15,392 --> 00:37:16,192
Just get me out of here.

559
00:37:16,286 --> 00:37:17,886
<i>and to have one present
during any questioning...</i>

560
00:37:18,686 --> 00:37:21,516
<i>If you can't afford a lawyer,
one will be provided for you.</i>

561
00:37:28,317 --> 00:37:30,186
I'm gonna make this
quite simple for you.

562
00:37:30,286 --> 00:37:32,222
You're gonna tell me what you're doing,

563
00:37:32,322 --> 00:37:34,186
how many of you there
are and how you got here.

564
00:37:34,286 --> 00:37:35,451
Let her go.

565
00:37:35,552 --> 00:37:38,086
Unless you're answering my
questions, don't speak.

566
00:37:38,187 --> 00:37:40,115
I want you to tell me everything or
I'll cut off her other hand.

567
00:37:40,787 --> 00:37:41,886
What?!

568
00:37:41,987 --> 00:37:43,886
- "Other"?
- The first one isn't negotiable.

569
00:37:43,987 --> 00:37:46,152
It's just to illustrate
how serious I am.

570
00:37:46,252 --> 00:37:47,052
No!

571
00:37:47,152 --> 00:37:49,976
Hold on! Hold on! Chill out!
We're not supposed to be here.

572
00:37:50,076 --> 00:37:51,586
Something's happening to the island.

573
00:37:51,687 --> 00:37:53,121
- There are these flashes-
- Do it!

574
00:37:53,221 --> 00:37:53,721
No!

575
00:37:53,821 --> 00:37:55,586
Wait a second! I'll tell
you whatever you want to know!

576
00:37:55,687 --> 00:37:57,216
- Do it!
- No!

577
00:38:28,016 --> 00:38:30,786
James.
Juliet.

578
00:38:34,917 --> 00:38:36,887
Nice to see you.

579
00:39:58,557 --> 00:39:59,851
Any luck?

580
00:39:59,952 --> 00:40:01,351
Yes.

581
00:40:01,952 --> 00:40:03,221
Really?

582
00:40:03,322 --> 00:40:04,822
Really.

583
00:40:05,621 --> 00:40:07,086
What about you?

584
00:40:07,187 --> 00:40:08,662
I'm having some... difficulties.

585
00:40:08,812 --> 00:40:12,442
Well, you better get busy...
because you only have 70 hours.

586
00:40:12,552 --> 00:40:13,152
What? No, no.

587
00:40:13,252 --> 00:40:14,822
That's not enough time.
I need at least--

588
00:40:14,922 --> 00:40:17,522
<i>What you need is irrelevant.</i>

589
00:40:18,922 --> 00:40:21,287
70 hours is what you've got.

590
00:40:22,286 --> 00:40:24,417
Look, I lost Reyes tonight.

591
00:40:27,357 --> 00:40:31,286
So what happens if I can't
get them all to come back?

592
00:40:34,117 --> 00:40:36,087
Then God help us all.

593
00:40:40,333 --> 00:40:44,333
