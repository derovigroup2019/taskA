1
00:00:00,382 --> 00:00:01,876
Previously on "Lost"...

2
00:00:01,976 --> 00:00:03,540
How did you know my father?

3
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:07,780
He came to see his daughter.
My daughter was on your plane.

4
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:11,570
Her name was Claire.

5
00:00:13,930 --> 00:00:15,799
We're here to get
a blood sample from you...

6
00:00:15,899 --> 00:00:17,595
and one
from your son Aaron.

7
00:00:17,695 --> 00:00:18,650
Why?

8
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:21,220
To determine your
relationship to the child.

9
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:23,050
<i>Where are you going, mommy?</i>

10
00:00:23,150 --> 00:00:25,200
We're going on vacation, baby.

11
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:28,940
Wait, you're in L.A.?
Of course we can meet, yeah.

12
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:30,910
Hello, Kate.

13
00:00:33,470 --> 00:00:34,435
You okay?

14
00:00:34,985 --> 00:00:36,760
Get me to the car.

15
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:41,910
- Sayid, you've been attacked.
- Where's Hurley?

16
00:00:42,010 --> 00:00:45,070
The only way to save the island, John,
is to get your people back here.

17
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:47,080
How? How am I supposed to do that?

18
00:00:56,190 --> 00:00:58,120
What? You've...

19
00:01:00,670 --> 00:01:02,750
Do you know what's happening to me?

20
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:10,470
Charlotte? Charlotte?

21
00:01:29,860 --> 00:01:30,660
Hey.

22
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:32,850
Oh, you don't have to whisper.

23
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:36,870
- When he's out, he's out.
- Yeah.

24
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:41,060
At least one of us can sleep.

25
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:42,581
It's gonna take more than two nights...

26
00:01:42,731 --> 00:01:44,951
for me to get used to
sleeping in a normal bed.

27
00:01:47,470 --> 00:01:49,640
What are we gonna do about him?

28
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:52,080
About Aaron.

29
00:01:53,230 --> 00:01:54,870
I don't know.

30
00:01:54,970 --> 00:01:57,560
I've been thinking a lot about him.

31
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:02,455
Did you know that Claire was flying
to L.A. to give him up for adoption?

32
00:02:02,555 --> 00:02:05,520
No. No, I didn't.

33
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:21,980
I think we should say he's mine.

34
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:25,500
What?

35
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:28,520
We could say that I was six months
pregnant when I was arrested

36
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:30,660
and that I gave birth
to him on the island.

37
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:32,109
- No one would ever know.
- Kate.

38
00:02:32,259 --> 00:02:33,710
No. You don't have to...

39
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:37,090
There's other ways to do this.

40
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:41,700
After everyone we've lost...
Michael, Jin, Sawyer...

41
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:44,420
I can't lose him, too.

42
00:02:45,550 --> 00:02:47,520
Sawyer's not dead.

43
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:49,270
I know.

44
00:02:49,550 --> 00:02:51,520
But he's gone.

45
00:02:56,950 --> 00:02:58,830
Good night, Jack.

46
00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:02,920
Kate.

47
00:03:05,690 --> 00:03:07,400
If we're gonna be safe,

48
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:10,290
if we're gonna protect the
people that we left behind,

49
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:13,700
tomorrow morning, I'm gonna
have to convince everyone to lie.

50
00:03:14,330 --> 00:03:17,410
If it's just me, they're
never gonna go for it.

51
00:03:17,510 --> 00:03:19,950
So I'm gonna turn to you first.

52
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:23,080
Are you with me?

53
00:03:31,970 --> 00:03:34,050
I have always been with you.

54
00:03:52,530 --> 00:03:53,760
How does it fit?

55
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:56,469
It's perfect. Thank you for the loaner.

56
00:03:56,619 --> 00:03:58,150
Looks great on you.

57
00:03:59,930 --> 00:04:01,829
Are you sure you want to do this?

58
00:04:01,979 --> 00:04:03,269
It was your idea.

59
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:04,880
Mommy!

60
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:09,410
Aaron, honey, mommy's gonna
run out and do an errand.

61
00:04:09,510 --> 00:04:12,360
I'll be right back. Okay?
And then we can go home.

62
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:13,920
Don't worry about us, Kate.

63
00:04:14,070 --> 00:04:17,480
There's candy in the minibar
and a hundred channels on tv.

64
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:20,000
We're going to be just fine here.

65
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:22,340
Sun...

66
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:25,690
I don't know what I would've
done if you weren't here.

67
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:27,550
Thank you.

68
00:04:27,650 --> 00:04:29,740
It's what any friend would do.

69
00:04:31,190 --> 00:04:33,750
Okay, well, I will be back soon.

70
00:04:34,050 --> 00:04:35,580
Okay, you be good for Sun.

71
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:37,330
Okay, honey?

72
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,990
Good luck.

73
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,780
Delivery for you, Ms. Kwon.

74
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:48,450
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

75
00:04:56,570 --> 00:04:58,470
I'll be right back, honey.

00:05:54,362 --> 00:05:57,362

78
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:15,500
Charlotte? Charlotte.

79
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,822
What the hell is wrong with her?
She's been out for ten minutes.

80
00:06:17,922 --> 00:06:19,510
Stop shouting, James.

81
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:23,230
Hey, man.

82
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:25,190
Thank you.

83
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:32,050
If there's something that you want to
tell me, Daniel, now would be a good time.

84
00:06:32,730 --> 00:06:34,030
I'm not sure what you mean exactly.

85
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:36,135
She's asking if you know why
your girlfriend had a seizure.

86
00:06:36,235 --> 00:06:37,850
Give us some space, would you?

87
00:06:37,950 --> 00:06:39,515
She's like this 'cause
the sky keeps lighting up.

88
00:06:39,615 --> 00:06:41,690
He knew this would happen and he
didn't say squat about it.

89
00:06:41,790 --> 00:06:43,259
James.

90
00:06:43,709 --> 00:06:45,290
Go away.

91
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:56,530
Did you know that this would happen?

92
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:00,570
I thought...

93
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:02,740
I thought it might.

94
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:06,520
I think it's neurological.

95
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:09,460
Our brains have an internal clock,
a sense of time.

96
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:12,980
The flashes... throw the clock off.

97
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:17,120
It's like really bad jet lag.

98
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:22,570
Really bad jet lag doesn't
make you hemorrhage, Daniel.

99
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:27,970
You wanna tell me why it isn't
happening to the rest of us?

100
00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:29,380
I don't know.

101
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:35,610
But thank God it's not.

102
00:07:44,450 --> 00:07:46,010
Thank you for waiting.

103
00:07:46,210 --> 00:07:47,660
Did my assistant offer
you something to drink?

104
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:49,490
Um, yes. I'm fine, thank you.

105
00:07:49,690 --> 00:07:52,370
Good. Please, Ms. Austen, sit.

106
00:07:54,990 --> 00:07:56,100
So...

107
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:57,680
How can I help you?

108
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,340
Mr. Norton,

109
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:04,230
when you came to my house
looking for blood samples

110
00:08:04,330 --> 00:08:09,490
from me and my son,
I asked you who your client was.

111
00:08:09,590 --> 00:08:11,250
- And I said I couldn't tell you.
- Yeah.

112
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:14,440
I'm here to offer you a deal.

113
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:19,090
I'll give you the blood samples,

114
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:21,920
but first, I wanna talk to your client.

115
00:08:22,310 --> 00:08:26,010
Considering what you're asking for,
that's more than reasonable.

116
00:08:26,110 --> 00:08:29,020
Well, I am, uh, seeing
my client later today,

117
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:32,290
and I will be sure to
pass along your offer.

118
00:08:32,390 --> 00:08:36,340
But I am pretty sure of
what the answer's gonna be:

119
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:38,860
No.

120
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:39,950
And the reason, of course,

121
00:08:40,050 --> 00:08:42,670
is that you're in no position
to be making any kind of deals,

122
00:08:42,770 --> 00:08:44,340
and we both know it.

123
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:46,410
I have a signed court
order compelling you

124
00:08:46,510 --> 00:08:48,570
to let us confirm that
you're the child's mother.

125
00:08:48,670 --> 00:08:51,290
I could send the sheriff over
there today and make you do it,

126
00:08:51,390 --> 00:08:53,410
but my client insists that we...

127
00:08:54,110 --> 00:08:57,560
handle the exchange of custody quietly.

128
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:01,470
What do you mean "exchange of custody"?

129
00:09:01,570 --> 00:09:02,920
You know exactly what I mean.

130
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:05,630
No, I...

131
00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:08,500
Mr. Norton,

132
00:09:08,670 --> 00:09:11,570
I just wanna know who
is doing this to me.

133
00:09:11,870 --> 00:09:14,140
You did this to yourself.

134
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:18,190
Now it is time you
prepare yourself, Ms. Austen.

135
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:22,710
You are going to lose the boy.

136
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:40,730
We have to go back to The Orchid.

137
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:42,750
Excuse me?

138
00:09:42,850 --> 00:09:44,220
The Orchid.

139
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:47,870
That's where all this started.
Maybe it's where it'll all stop.

140
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:53,470
That greenhouse is a long ways away.

141
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:56,820
You said you had a
zodiac raft back at the beach.

142
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:58,590
We could take that,
cut around the horn of the island,

143
00:09:58,690 --> 00:10:00,030
be at The Orchid in half the time.

144
00:10:00,130 --> 00:10:02,111
And let me guess. You know exactly
what to do when we get there.

145
00:10:02,211 --> 00:10:03,335
No, not exactly at all,

146
00:10:03,435 --> 00:10:05,220
but I know that Ben used
it to leave the island.

147
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:09,370
And if I can do the same thing,
I believe I can save us.

148
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:11,490
And how you gonna do that?

149
00:10:11,590 --> 00:10:14,410
This is all happening because they left.

150
00:10:14,810 --> 00:10:16,880
I think it'll stop if
I can bring them back.

151
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:20,310
- Bring who back?
- Jack, Sun, Sayid, Hugo, Kate.

152
00:10:20,410 --> 00:10:22,585
The boat blew up,
and that chopper was probably on it.

153
00:10:22,685 --> 00:10:24,020
They're not dead, James.

154
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:27,455
- Says who?
- That doesn't matter.

155
00:10:27,855 --> 00:10:30,260
All that matters is
they've gotta come back.

156
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:33,050
I have to make them come back...

157
00:10:33,830 --> 00:10:36,010
even if it kills me.

158
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:40,570
Don't you want 'em to come back, James?

159
00:10:41,770 --> 00:10:44,170
Don't you want her to come back?

160
00:10:49,310 --> 00:10:51,450
It doesn't matter what I want.

161
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:52,901
<i>Hey!</i>

162
00:10:54,051 --> 00:10:55,670
She's waking up!

163
00:11:00,010 --> 00:11:01,850
Are you okay?

164
00:11:04,110 --> 00:11:05,410
Who are you?

165
00:11:05,510 --> 00:11:07,090
It's me.

166
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,960
It's Daniel.

167
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:14,450
Daniel.

168
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:18,152
Oww..

169
00:11:19,302 --> 00:11:20,775
Oh, my head.

170
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:25,470
What happened?

171
00:11:25,570 --> 00:11:28,230
There was another flash. You passed out.

172
00:11:28,850 --> 00:11:30,440
How do you feel?

173
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:32,880
A bit dizzy, but...

174
00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:35,980
I'm fine.

175
00:11:36,270 --> 00:11:37,130
Good.

176
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:39,280
Hooray. Everything's back to normal.

177
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:41,620
Now what?

178
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:43,500
I'll tell you "now what. "

179
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:47,670
We're going to The Orchid.

180
00:12:03,170 --> 00:12:05,687
<i>Oncologist on call to the I.C.U.</i>

181
00:12:05,787 --> 00:12:07,510
Dilation's almost back to normal.

182
00:12:07,610 --> 00:12:09,820
Good. Now take this I.V.
out of my arm, and let's go.

183
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:12,590
Sayid, you were
unconscious for over 42 hours.

184
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:15,540
You had the equivalent of three doses
of horse tranquilizer in your system.

185
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:18,100
If you sent that man to
Hurley's house, we have to leave...

186
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:19,471
- You need to relax.
- ... now.

187
00:12:19,571 --> 00:12:21,650
Ben is not gonna hurt Hurley.

188
00:12:22,050 --> 00:12:23,990
Ben is on our side.

189
00:12:24,090 --> 00:12:26,570
The only side he's on is his own.

190
00:12:26,770 --> 00:12:28,470
<i>Dr. Shephard?</i>

191
00:12:28,570 --> 00:12:31,620
I'm Dr. Ariza, director
of clinical services.

192
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:34,400
A word with you, please?

193
00:12:36,490 --> 00:12:38,250
I'll be right back.

194
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:43,050
What do you think you are doing here?

195
00:12:43,150 --> 00:12:44,540
I was treating a patient.

196
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:46,580
I apologize. It was an emergency.
I know that-

197
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:49,455
You were suspended
on charges of substance abuse.

198
00:12:49,555 --> 00:12:52,620
Emergency or not, Dr. Shephard,
you have no business being here.

199
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:55,830
I understand, and I take
full responsibility for my actions.

200
00:12:55,930 --> 00:12:56,850
No, doctor.

201
00:12:56,950 --> 00:12:59,220
The hospital takes full
responsibility for your actions,

202
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:01,480
and that makes us liable for them.

203
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:04,080
Excuse me.

204
00:13:06,630 --> 00:13:08,840
- Hello?
<i>- Jack? It's me. </i>

205
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:10,909
- Hurley.
<i>- Hey, did Sayid get to you?</i>

206
00:13:11,009 --> 00:13:12,130
Did my dad drop him off?

207
00:13:12,230 --> 00:13:14,380
- Yes, he did. Hurley, where are-?
<i>- Is he okay?</i>

208
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:15,915
- He's fine.
- Awesome.

209
00:13:16,015 --> 00:13:17,165
<i>Hurley, where are you?</i>

210
00:13:17,265 --> 00:13:20,130
Dude, I'm totally cool.
I'm in L.A. County lockup.

211
00:13:20,230 --> 00:13:22,390
Oh, and tell Sayid I did
exactly what he said.

212
00:13:22,490 --> 00:13:24,725
I'm totally safe. Ben's
never gonna get me now. Thank you.

213
00:13:24,825 --> 00:13:27,120
What are you talking about,
Hurley? Wait! Wait-

214
00:13:32,070 --> 00:13:35,230
Good. You're here. How's Sayid?

215
00:13:37,050 --> 00:13:39,180
How are you doing today, sir?

216
00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:43,840
Got your meds for you.

217
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:46,310
Sorry, I think you have the wrong room.

218
00:13:46,510 --> 00:13:48,650
Nope. Room 133, right?

219
00:13:49,710 --> 00:13:53,550
Got the orders right
here. Don't worry.

220
00:13:53,650 --> 00:13:55,950
I won't have to give you an injection.

221
00:13:56,690 --> 00:13:58,960
Put this right in your I.V. line.

222
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:25,740
Who are you? Who are you working for?

223
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:33,741
Okay, talk, talk.

224
00:14:33,841 --> 00:14:36,220
Address... it's in my pocket.

225
00:14:57,670 --> 00:14:59,300
Hello, Sayid.

226
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:02,490
What happened?

227
00:15:02,590 --> 00:15:05,690
Do we know anyone who
lives at 42 Panorama Crest?

228
00:15:09,650 --> 00:15:11,430
That's Kate's address.

229
00:15:25,850 --> 00:15:26,830
Hello?

230
00:15:26,930 --> 00:15:29,900
Kate? It's Jack. Are you okay?

231
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:31,160
Yeah. I'm fine.

232
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:33,240
<i>Where are you right
now? Are you at home?</i>

233
00:15:33,990 --> 00:15:34,670
Uh... What?

234
00:15:34,770 --> 00:15:36,770
Listen, I'll explain
everything once you're out,

235
00:15:36,870 --> 00:15:39,690
- but you've gotta get Aaron-
<i>- Look, I'm not at home, okay? I'm... </i>

236
00:15:39,790 --> 00:15:41,870
Aaron is at a hotel with Sun.

237
00:15:41,970 --> 00:15:43,180
Sun? Sun's in L.A.?

238
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:45,100
Yeah, she's here on business.

239
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:48,900
Listen, Jack, this is
really not a good time.

240
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,860
<i>I'm so sorry that I even
picked up the phone. I'm not-</i>

241
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:54,620
Kate, do not hang up on me.
Please listen. Listen, uh...

242
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:57,970
Will you tell me where you are?
I need to see you.

243
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:01,650
Kate, please.

244
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:04,730
I'm downtown.
<i>Wilshire and Olive. </i>

245
00:16:04,830 --> 00:16:06,810
Okay. All right. I'm on my way.

246
00:16:07,510 --> 00:16:09,530
She's not at home,
but I'm gonna go to her right now.

247
00:16:09,730 --> 00:16:11,780
- Good. I'll go deal with Hugo.
- Sorry, Ben.

248
00:16:13,530 --> 00:16:15,140
I'm not letting
you get anywhere near him.

249
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:16,590
You have friends in trouble.

250
00:16:16,690 --> 00:16:19,740
Let's get them to safety
and save the dirty linen for later.

251
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:24,810
I'll drive.

252
00:16:24,910 --> 00:16:26,270
After you get Kate,

253
00:16:26,370 --> 00:16:28,930
meet us at the Long
Beach Marina, slip 23.

254
00:16:29,030 --> 00:16:32,650
And, Jack... Hurry.
We're running out of time.

255
00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:42,910
Hey, Locke.

256
00:16:43,350 --> 00:16:45,100
What are you gonna say to her?

257
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:46,650
Sorry?

258
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:48,130
Kate.

259
00:16:48,230 --> 00:16:51,050
What are you gonna say to her
to get her to come back?

260
00:16:52,540 --> 00:16:54,630
I haven't figured that out yet.

261
00:16:54,830 --> 00:16:57,020
Well, let me tell you something.
She was pretty excited

262
00:16:57,170 --> 00:16:59,720
to hop on that chopper
and get the hell out of here.

263
00:17:10,190 --> 00:17:11,780
What the hell is that?

264
00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:21,400
Whatever it is, we
better stay clear of it.

265
00:17:22,970 --> 00:17:24,950
Beach is this way.

266
00:17:25,830 --> 00:17:28,000
Now you wanna take the scenic route?

267
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:29,630
John...

268
00:17:30,430 --> 00:17:32,660
<i>Do you know when we are?</i>

269
00:17:35,490 --> 00:17:37,220
We need to keep moving.

270
00:17:56,630 --> 00:17:59,290
Hey. How's your headache?

271
00:17:59,390 --> 00:18:00,330
Better.

272
00:18:00,430 --> 00:18:03,400
Nothing like sore feet to take
your mind off your head, eh?

273
00:18:04,350 --> 00:18:05,150
Well, don't worry.

274
00:18:05,190 --> 00:18:06,740
Once we get to the beach,
we're gonna take the zodiac

275
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:09,290
around the other side
of the island and rest.

276
00:18:09,690 --> 00:18:13,010
You're sweet, but you don't
need to baby me. I'm fine.

277
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:17,890
You okay?

278
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:19,709
I'm peachy.

279
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:24,830
Now what?

280
00:18:27,808 --> 00:18:29,560
Nobody move.

281
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:33,063
James!

282
00:18:33,313 --> 00:18:35,210
I got this.

283
00:18:39,614 --> 00:18:41,114
<i>... you con't stop now. </i>

284
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:48,020
<i>It knows I don't want it,
and I was gonna give it away. </i>

285
00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:49,860
<i>Babies know that stuff. </i>

286
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:52,110
Okay, no, no, hang on. Listen, listen.

287
00:18:52,210 --> 00:18:54,010
Do you want this baby?

288
00:18:54,110 --> 00:18:56,780
<i>Do you want it to be safe and healthy?</i>

289
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:58,660
You're not alone in this.

290
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:01,000
We are all here for you.
This baby is all of ours.

291
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:03,980
But I need you to push.

292
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:05,780
Okay?

293
00:19:08,020 --> 00:19:10,680
One, two, three...

294
00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:13,440
Push! Push!

295
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:16,440
Come on, Claire! Push!

296
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:20,800
Okay! He's coming!

297
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:22,510
Push! Push! Push! Push!

298
00:19:22,610 --> 00:19:25,770
Push! Push! Push! Push!

299
00:20:09,930 --> 00:20:11,720
James?

300
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:15,500
What happened?

301
00:20:17,470 --> 00:20:19,670
Did you see something out here, James?

302
00:20:26,670 --> 00:20:28,300
It don't matter.

303
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:31,340
It's gone now.

304
00:21:00,770 --> 00:21:02,450
You shaved your beard.

305
00:21:02,570 --> 00:21:03,370
Yeah.

306
00:21:04,170 --> 00:21:05,690
I just needed a change.

307
00:21:12,770 --> 00:21:14,820
Look, Jack, uh...

308
00:21:15,220 --> 00:21:16,608
I don't know why you called,

309
00:21:16,708 --> 00:21:19,480
but I can't be dealing
with this right now.

310
00:21:23,530 --> 00:21:25,180
What's going on?

311
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:26,830
Nothing. Just...

312
00:21:26,930 --> 00:21:29,740
- Can you just go?
- Why don't you just tell me?

313
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:31,210
Jack, please, just go.

314
00:21:31,310 --> 00:21:33,170
Kate, please, tell me.

315
00:21:38,810 --> 00:21:40,870
Somebody wants Aaron.

316
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:42,600
What?

317
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:44,290
There's a lawyer in there.

318
00:21:44,390 --> 00:21:46,400
His clients... they know we're lying.

319
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:49,610
They know I'm not his mom,
and they're gonna take him away.

320
00:21:49,710 --> 00:21:51,650
Who's gonna take him away?

321
00:21:56,670 --> 00:21:57,990
What- what are you doing?

322
00:21:58,090 --> 00:22:00,530
Look, I gotta go, all right?
Get in or don't.

323
00:22:17,054 --> 00:22:18,254
Hey.

324
00:22:18,750 --> 00:22:20,810
You ready to tell me
who you saw back there?

325
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:23,770
Already told you. It was nothin'.

326
00:22:24,910 --> 00:22:28,040
<i>You and I both know when</i>
we were before the flash, James.

327
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:30,540
So who was it you saw?

328
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:32,940
Charlie? Shannon? Yourself?

329
00:22:33,890 --> 00:22:36,860
And how is it that you
knew when we were, Johnny boy?

330
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:41,550
That light in the sky...
it was from the hatch, wasn't it?

331
00:22:44,290 --> 00:22:46,310
The night that Boone died...

332
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:50,190
I went out there and started
pounding on it as hard as I could.

333
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:54,610
I was... confused. Scared.

334
00:22:56,670 --> 00:22:58,700
Babbling like an idiot,

335
00:22:59,210 --> 00:23:01,990
asking, why was all
this happening to me?

336
00:23:03,070 --> 00:23:04,920
Did you get an answer?

337
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:07,930
Light came on, shot up into the sky.

338
00:23:08,860 --> 00:23:10,970
At the time, I thought
it meant something.

339
00:23:11,070 --> 00:23:12,420
Did it?

340
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:14,820
No. It was just a light.

341
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:17,830
So why'd you turn us around then?

342
00:23:17,930 --> 00:23:19,870
Don't you wanna go back there?

343
00:23:19,970 --> 00:23:21,770
Why would I wanna do that?

344
00:23:22,370 --> 00:23:24,373
So you could tell yourself
to do things different,

345
00:23:24,473 --> 00:23:26,720
save yourself a world of pain.

346
00:23:27,620 --> 00:23:31,940
No, I needed that pain
to get to where I am now.

347
00:23:40,867 --> 00:23:42,267
Hey.

348
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:44,250
I just got a nosebleed.

349
00:23:45,490 --> 00:23:47,670
What? When?

350
00:23:48,270 --> 00:23:51,050
Let's just not freak
out the others, okay?

351
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:53,180
Just tell me...

352
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:54,757
Why-why her? Why me?

353
00:23:54,907 --> 00:23:56,060
I don't know.

354
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:59,605
Uh, I think it might have something
to do with duration of exposure.

355
00:23:59,705 --> 00:24:01,580
You know, the amount of time
you've spent on the island.

356
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:04,690
Doesn't make any sense.
Those yahoos have been here for months.

357
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:07,237
I've never been here
before two weeks ago.

358
00:24:07,737 --> 00:24:09,480
Are you sure about that?

359
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:12,470
<i>Hello?!</i>

360
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:18,490
The camp's back.

361
00:24:18,870 --> 00:24:20,380
Finally.

362
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:22,590
Anybody for a Dharma beer?

363
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:25,770
Hello? Anybody here?

364
00:24:25,870 --> 00:24:27,930
Rose? Bernard?

365
00:24:35,490 --> 00:24:37,540
I wonder how long ago this happened.

366
00:24:40,730 --> 00:24:42,670
Son of a bitch!

367
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:47,050
What is it?

368
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:49,150
It's Vincent's.

369
00:24:49,250 --> 00:24:51,290
Yeah? Well, where's the rest of the dog?

370
00:24:51,390 --> 00:24:53,550
Where's the rest of our people?

371
00:24:56,290 --> 00:24:58,320
The zodiac's gone, too.

372
00:24:58,620 --> 00:25:00,840
Maybe your people took the boat.

373
00:25:00,940 --> 00:25:02,940
Why the hell would they do that?

374
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:06,470
To get away from whoever came in those.

375
00:25:13,130 --> 00:25:14,800
Where did these come from?

376
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:16,510
That's a good question.

377
00:25:16,770 --> 00:25:18,200
They're pretty old.

378
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:19,900
Not that old.

379
00:25:20,350 --> 00:25:22,060
Let me see that.

380
00:25:24,670 --> 00:25:25,800
"adg-uh-ruh"?

381
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:27,430
Ajira. It's an airline.

382
00:25:27,530 --> 00:25:29,790
It's based out of India,
but they fly everywhere.

383
00:25:29,890 --> 00:25:32,830
Great. Maybe they got a flight
out of here to Vegas tonight.

384
00:25:33,230 --> 00:25:35,809
Who came in these?
Other Others?

385
00:25:35,909 --> 00:25:37,520
Don't look at me.

386
00:25:38,180 --> 00:25:40,690
My question is, when
are they coming back?

387
00:25:40,790 --> 00:25:42,620
Let's not wait to find out.

388
00:26:09,340 --> 00:26:13,540
This plan sounded a hell of a lot better
when we were going by motorboat.

389
00:26:14,710 --> 00:26:16,170
How far is this place?

390
00:26:16,270 --> 00:26:18,042
It's around that point.

391
00:26:18,142 --> 00:26:20,390
Not more than a couple hours.

392
00:26:20,490 --> 00:26:22,190
Oh, joy.

393
00:26:26,330 --> 00:26:28,090
You all right?

394
00:26:29,250 --> 00:26:30,690
I saw Kate.

395
00:26:30,790 --> 00:26:31,750
What?

396
00:26:31,850 --> 00:26:34,730
Last night, in the jungle.

397
00:26:36,260 --> 00:26:38,270
Before the last flash.

398
00:26:40,690 --> 00:26:43,270
She was delivering Claire's baby.

399
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:47,300
But that was two months ago.

400
00:26:48,730 --> 00:26:50,560
Time travel's a bitch.

401
00:26:50,660 --> 00:26:51,460
Get down!

402
00:26:54,750 --> 00:26:56,520
Paddle!

403
00:26:58,970 --> 00:27:00,857
I think they want their boat back!

404
00:27:01,007 --> 00:27:02,040
Move!

405
00:27:09,070 --> 00:27:10,667
Are these your people?!

406
00:27:10,767 --> 00:27:12,090
No! Are they yours?!

407
00:27:12,190 --> 00:27:14,070
Shut up and keeping paddling!

408
00:27:19,330 --> 00:27:21,810
Little help! Little help!

409
00:27:29,130 --> 00:27:31,880
Paddle harder! They're getting closer!

410
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:39,960
Thank you, lord!

411
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:50,710
I take that back!

412
00:27:51,110 --> 00:27:54,430
Everybody, paddle! Head for the shore!

413
00:28:17,090 --> 00:28:20,340
Kate, just because the guy
told you that he was meeting his client

414
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:21,790
doesn't mean that they're here in L.A.

415
00:28:21,890 --> 00:28:24,022
He could've just told
you that to-to throw you off.

416
00:28:24,122 --> 00:28:26,160
Or they're in
that hotel right now.

417
00:28:29,690 --> 00:28:31,760
Okay. And what if they are?

418
00:28:31,860 --> 00:28:33,526
What if the person who
wants to take Aaron

419
00:28:33,626 --> 00:28:35,190
is sitting in that hotel room right now?

420
00:28:35,790 --> 00:28:37,360
Then what?

421
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:41,535
Come on. Come with me.
We'll- we'll go get Aaron,

422
00:28:41,635 --> 00:28:44,580
we'll put our heads together,
and we'll figure something out.

423
00:28:45,060 --> 00:28:46,770
All right.

424
00:28:56,170 --> 00:28:58,310
Oh, my God.

425
00:28:59,420 --> 00:29:01,450
It's Claire's mother.

426
00:29:26,410 --> 00:29:27,520
Wait.

427
00:29:27,620 --> 00:29:29,560
- What am I waiting for, Jack?
- Wait. I just...

428
00:29:29,660 --> 00:29:31,082
Let's just think about this for a minute.

429
00:29:31,182 --> 00:29:32,690
- She knows.
- Maybe she doesn't know.

430
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:35,400
No, but she knows about Aaron,
and that's all that matters.

431
00:29:39,850 --> 00:29:41,340
Let me go talk to her.

432
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:42,240
What?

433
00:29:42,337 --> 00:29:44,480
If I can just explain
to her why we did it,

434
00:29:44,580 --> 00:29:47,570
maybe if I can get her
to understand why...

435
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:50,590
She'll listen to me.

436
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:55,460
I can fix this, Kate. I can fix it.

437
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:03,380
Aaron is my family, too.

438
00:30:34,750 --> 00:30:36,410
Dr. Shephard?

439
00:30:36,510 --> 00:30:39,960
Hello, Ms. Littleton. Um...

440
00:30:40,060 --> 00:30:41,490
May I come in?

441
00:30:41,590 --> 00:30:43,070
Of course.

442
00:30:46,660 --> 00:30:47,900
You look drenched.

443
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,940
No, no. No, I'm fine.

444
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:53,830
God, I haven't seen you
since your father's funeral.

445
00:30:55,110 --> 00:30:57,780
How did you even know I was here?

446
00:30:58,990 --> 00:31:02,280
I knew you were here, Ms. Littleton,

447
00:31:02,420 --> 00:31:05,160
because I followed your lawyer.

448
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:08,950
Why would you do that?

449
00:31:09,450 --> 00:31:12,170
I'm- I did it because, um...

450
00:31:12,470 --> 00:31:16,190
I understand that you
feel the need to do this.

451
00:31:16,390 --> 00:31:17,650
But I need you to know

452
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:21,710
that everything that Kate
and I have done... it was for Aaron.

453
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:28,380
Who's... Aaron?

454
00:31:30,980 --> 00:31:33,730
I- I'm afraid I'm not following you.

455
00:31:33,830 --> 00:31:36,160
Ms. Littleton, um...

456
00:31:36,330 --> 00:31:39,060
What are you doing here in Los Angeles?

457
00:31:46,990 --> 00:31:48,320
Let's go. Drive.

458
00:31:48,420 --> 00:31:51,090
Then call Sun and tell her to bring
Aaron to the Long Beach Marina.

459
00:31:51,190 --> 00:31:52,758
- We'll meet her there.
- What-wh-what are you talking about?

460
00:31:52,858 --> 00:31:53,979
- What happened?
- Kate, we have to go now.

461
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:56,730
I'm not going anywhere
until you tell me what just happened.

462
00:31:56,830 --> 00:31:58,540
She doesn't know anything.

463
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:01,340
What?

464
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:03,170
She doesn't know.

465
00:32:03,270 --> 00:32:05,960
She still thinks that Claire is dead.

466
00:32:07,410 --> 00:32:09,350
She doesn't even know that Aaron exists.

467
00:32:09,450 --> 00:32:10,450
But the lawyer...?

468
00:32:10,550 --> 00:32:13,130
She sued Oceanic, and she's in
town to pick up her settlement.

469
00:32:13,630 --> 00:32:15,670
What, and it's just a
coincidence that her lawyer

470
00:32:15,770 --> 00:32:17,834
happens to be the same one
that's trying to take my son?

471
00:32:17,934 --> 00:32:19,020
I don't know.

472
00:32:19,820 --> 00:32:22,040
But whoever's trying to take Aaron...

473
00:32:22,550 --> 00:32:24,030
It's not her.

474
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:26,550
Then who is it?

475
00:32:31,430 --> 00:32:33,270
Can I ask you something?

476
00:32:35,610 --> 00:32:37,890
Why'd you take it upon
yourself to rescue Hugo?

477
00:32:39,250 --> 00:32:41,460
I had to make sure Hurley was safe.

478
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:44,530
You can pull in over here.

479
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:10,110
Mr. Linus.

480
00:33:10,510 --> 00:33:12,120
Mr. Norton.

481
00:33:13,010 --> 00:33:14,080
I looked into it,

482
00:33:14,180 --> 00:33:16,640
and they don't have any kind
of solid case against Reyes.

483
00:33:16,740 --> 00:33:19,156
The M.E. said that the man found outside

484
00:33:19,256 --> 00:33:22,180
Santa Rosa was killed
before Reyes escaped.

485
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:23,440
That's very good news.

486
00:33:23,540 --> 00:33:24,810
We have a prelim hearing in the morning.

487
00:33:25,010 --> 00:33:27,390
The judge will never
let it get past that,

488
00:33:27,690 --> 00:33:29,710
and Reyes will be a free man.

489
00:33:31,940 --> 00:33:33,000
Thank you, Dan.

490
00:33:33,100 --> 00:33:34,740
Anytime.

491
00:33:40,190 --> 00:33:41,760
Who was that?

492
00:33:43,220 --> 00:33:44,950
That's my lawyer.

493
00:33:49,284 --> 00:33:51,084
Okay.

494
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:56,850
Remind me never to do that again.

495
00:34:00,150 --> 00:34:01,247
Where are we?

496
00:34:01,347 --> 00:34:03,590
It's hard to say till it gets light.

497
00:34:14,910 --> 00:34:17,860
We didn't get a chance to
finish our conversation.

498
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:19,720
What conversation was that?

499
00:34:20,130 --> 00:34:22,860
The one before they
started shooting at us,

500
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:26,350
where you were about to tell me
how it felt to see Kate again.

501
00:34:26,790 --> 00:34:29,410
I wasn't about to tell you anything.

502
00:34:30,630 --> 00:34:32,850
Why don't you tell me now?

503
00:34:48,670 --> 00:34:50,730
I was close enough to touch her.

504
00:34:55,670 --> 00:34:57,720
If I'd wanted to, I could've...

505
00:34:59,110 --> 00:35:01,820
stood right up and talked to her.

506
00:35:03,420 --> 00:35:05,270
Why didn't you?

507
00:35:09,410 --> 00:35:11,480
What's done is done.

508
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:20,960
Juliet?

509
00:35:21,710 --> 00:35:23,330
What's wrong?

510
00:35:31,010 --> 00:35:32,810
Come and look at this!

511
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:42,460
It's wreckage.

512
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:44,390
Looks like it just happened.

513
00:35:55,060 --> 00:35:57,400
Anybody speak French?

514
00:37:31,430 --> 00:37:33,440
Jack, why did you call me today?

515
00:37:35,340 --> 00:37:37,290
I told you. I was...

516
00:37:37,390 --> 00:37:38,820
I was worried.

517
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:42,350
But why? Why were you
worried? Why today?

518
00:37:53,420 --> 00:37:54,280
I don't...

519
00:37:54,380 --> 00:37:56,250
Right before I called you,
Sayid was attacked.

520
00:37:56,350 --> 00:37:59,380
And the guy that did it...
your address was in his pocket.

521
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:01,960
Sayid? What's he doing here?

522
00:38:03,590 --> 00:38:05,200
That's not important right now.

523
00:38:05,300 --> 00:38:08,980
What matters is that we
get you and Aaron someplace safe.

524
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:11,960
Safe from who?

525
00:38:24,590 --> 00:38:26,290
Hello, Kate.

526
00:38:34,030 --> 00:38:37,040
It's okay. He's with me.

527
00:38:39,180 --> 00:38:40,440
He's with you?

528
00:38:40,540 --> 00:38:43,030
I know this is gonna
be hard to understand,

529
00:38:43,130 --> 00:38:44,970
but he's here to help us.

530
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:47,730
<i>To help everyone that we left behind. </i>

531
00:38:49,490 --> 00:38:51,164
We all need to be together again.

532
00:38:51,314 --> 00:38:52,480
It's him.

533
00:38:53,450 --> 00:38:55,070
What?

534
00:38:55,630 --> 00:38:58,400
It's him. He's the one
who's trying to take Aaron.

535
00:38:58,500 --> 00:39:01,840
- No. No. You- you don't understand.
- No, Jack. She's right.

536
00:39:02,530 --> 00:39:04,280
It was me.

537
00:39:06,770 --> 00:39:08,500
Sorry.

538
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:11,130
Who the hell do you think you are?

539
00:39:11,230 --> 00:39:12,770
Why don't you just stay away?!

540
00:39:12,870 --> 00:39:14,900
Why don't you leave
me and my son alone?!

541
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,630
Because he's not your son, Kate.

542
00:40:04,614 --> 00:40:05,814
You all right?

543
00:40:08,990 --> 00:40:10,950
No understand.

544
00:40:11,050 --> 00:40:12,530
You speak English?

545
00:40:13,620 --> 00:40:15,320
A little.

546
00:40:16,010 --> 00:40:17,580
<i>Are you okay?</i>

547
00:40:17,790 --> 00:40:19,220
Yes.

548
00:40:20,260 --> 00:40:21,850
How did you get here?

549
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:23,960
Boat.

550
00:40:24,193 --> 00:40:26,380
<i>Who is he? What does he say</i>

551
00:40:27,182 --> 00:40:28,782
<i>He said he came on a boat. </i>

552
00:40:29,830 --> 00:40:31,500
What boat?

553
00:40:32,820 --> 00:40:34,390
It's gone.

554
00:40:35,690 --> 00:40:37,105
Sink.

555
00:40:37,205 --> 00:40:38,940
It must've been caught in
the same storm as ours.

556
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:42,720
Who are you? How long you in the water?

557
00:40:43,220 --> 00:40:44,640
I don't know.

558
00:40:44,740 --> 00:40:47,160
How do you not know how you wound
up in the middle of the ocean, huh?

559
00:40:47,682 --> 00:40:49,761
Leave him alone. He's in shock.

560
00:40:49,862 --> 00:40:51,140
Can you get me him some water?

561
00:40:59,690 --> 00:41:01,590
Merci, Robert.

562
00:41:16,190 --> 00:41:17,750
Thank you.

563
00:41:19,940 --> 00:41:21,980
What is your name?

564
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:24,160
Kwon Jin.

565
00:41:26,210 --> 00:41:27,750
Jin.

566
00:41:27,850 --> 00:41:29,470
Hello, Jin.

567
00:41:29,700 --> 00:41:31,230
I'm Danielle.

568
00:41:31,330 --> 00:41:33,480
Danielle Rousseau.
