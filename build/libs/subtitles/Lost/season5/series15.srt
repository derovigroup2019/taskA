00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:01,785
<i>Previously on Lost:</i>

2
00:00:04,748 --> 00:00:05,509
Hello, Ben.

3
00:00:06,877 --> 00:00:09,219
- You're alive
- Yes, I am.

4
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:11,309
<i>Are you saying
you know how to find them?</i>

5
00:00:11,310 --> 00:00:12,495
How to find Jin?

6
00:00:12,496 --> 00:00:13,726
I have some ideas.

7
00:00:13,727 --> 00:00:14,852
So you knew...

8
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:18,556
this would happen to Locke
if we brought him back here?

9
00:00:18,557 --> 00:00:19,873
Dead is dead.

10
00:00:21,433 --> 00:00:23,584
You don't get
to come back from that.

11
00:00:24,843 --> 00:00:27,220
The Dharma folks
at the Swan work site--

12
00:00:27,255 --> 00:00:28,453
They're gonna
drill into the ground

13
00:00:28,488 --> 00:00:31,119
and accidentally tap into
a massive pocket of energy,

14
00:00:31,154 --> 00:00:33,291
and <i>that</i> will
cause <i>your</i> plane--

15
00:00:33,526 --> 00:00:35,064
Oceanic 815...

16
00:00:35,379 --> 00:00:36,682
To crash
on this island.

17
00:00:37,741 --> 00:00:39,960
I think
I can negate that energy.

18
00:00:39,995 --> 00:00:40,890
<i>If I can...</i>

19
00:00:41,613 --> 00:00:43,655
then that hatch
will never be built,

20
00:00:43,690 --> 00:00:46,625
and your plane will land
just like it's supposed to.

21
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:50,401
And just how exactly do you plan
on destroying this energy?

22
00:00:50,936 --> 00:00:52,829
I'm gonna detonate
a hydrogen bomb.

23
00:00:58,670 --> 00:00:59,799
Where is the bomb,
Richard?

24
00:01:00,205 --> 00:01:00,880
Where is it?

25
00:01:01,197 --> 00:01:02,864
The hydrogen bomb that
I told your people to bury.

26
00:01:02,899 --> 00:01:03,621
Where is it?

27
00:01:05,253 --> 00:01:05,775
Listen to me.

28
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:07,739
Lower your gun,
and we'll talk. Okay?

29
00:01:07,774 --> 00:01:10,206
Nobody has to get hurt here.
Just put the gun down.

30
00:01:16,342 --> 00:01:18,013
I'm gonna give you
three seconds.

31
00:01:19,611 --> 00:01:20,291
One...

32
00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:21,627
Don't do this.

33
00:01:23,303 --> 00:01:24,428
What's he
doing down there?

34
00:01:25,047 --> 00:01:27,162
- Jack, he's crazy.
- Is he?

35
00:01:29,162 --> 00:01:30,595
What if this is
why we're here?

36
00:01:33,022 --> 00:01:34,893
What if
this is our one chance

37
00:01:34,928 --> 00:01:36,575
to put things back the way
they're supposed to be?

38
00:01:41,884 --> 00:01:42,400
No.

39
00:01:42,698 --> 00:01:43,521
What the hell do you
think you're doing?!

40
00:01:43,556 --> 00:01:45,354
- They just shot him! I'm gonna go help.
- Yeah, they're gonna shoot you, too.

41
00:01:45,389 --> 00:01:47,128
We have to go, Jack.
We have to go now.

42
00:01:54,322 --> 00:01:55,594
- Jack!
- Don't you move!

43
00:01:59,342 --> 00:02:00,350
Don't move.

44
00:02:04,747 --> 00:02:05,866
<i>Hey!</i>

45
00:02:13,143 --> 00:02:14,999
Just who the bloody hell
might you be?

46
00:02:36,019 --> 00:02:36,906
<i>Eloise!</i>

47
00:02:38,668 --> 00:02:39,569
What happened?

48
00:02:43,290 --> 00:02:44,463
This man
walked into camp

49
00:02:44,498 --> 00:02:45,548
and put a gun
to my head,

50
00:02:45,583 --> 00:02:48,574
- And Eloise... reacted.
- Where'd you find them?

51
00:02:49,251 --> 00:02:51,693
Crouched in the bushes...
Like rats.

52
00:02:51,928 --> 00:02:53,824
Did you two come here
with this man?

53
00:02:57,246 --> 00:02:58,148
Yes.

54
00:03:01,382 --> 00:03:02,657
Put them in my tent.

55
00:03:05,614 --> 00:03:07,361
Would you care to tell me,
Eloise,

56
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:11,204
why the Dharma Initiative seems
to have declared war on us?

57
00:03:12,814 --> 00:03:15,772
These people aren't from
the Dharma Initiative, Charles.

58
00:03:20,523 --> 00:03:21,923
Then where the hell
<i>are</i> they from?

59
00:03:53,661 --> 00:03:55,563
Richard,
he's here.

60
00:04:09,072 --> 00:04:10,178
I brought dinner.

61
00:04:11,099 --> 00:04:11,949
John?

62
00:04:16,178 --> 00:04:17,030
<i>Hello, Richard.</i>

63
00:04:18,364 --> 00:04:19,362
It's been a while.

64
00:04:22,492 --> 00:04:25,438
It's--It's been, uh,
three years.

65
00:04:27,119 --> 00:04:29,650
What happened?
What--where--where were you?

66
00:04:29,685 --> 00:04:30,750
I'll explain on the way.

67
00:04:32,478 --> 00:04:33,462
On the way where?

68
00:04:33,633 --> 00:04:34,843
It's gonna be night
soon.

69
00:04:35,484 --> 00:04:36,894
You and I have
an errand to run,

70
00:04:36,894 --> 00:04:38,120
and we don't have
a lot of time.

71
00:04:42,973 --> 00:04:43,761
What's wrong?

72
00:04:45,882 --> 00:04:47,447
Something different
about you.

73
00:04:49,931 --> 00:04:51,357
I have a purpose now.

74
00:05:00,170 --> 00:05:01,268
What's he doing here?

75
00:05:02,644 --> 00:05:03,893
He helped me
get back.

76
00:05:10,747 --> 00:05:12,680
What did Locke say
these were his people?

77
00:05:12,989 --> 00:05:14,457
I thought
they were <i>yours.</i>

78
00:05:14,666 --> 00:05:16,775
When I left the island,
John stepped in.

79
00:05:17,893 --> 00:05:19,250
He's the leader now.

80
00:05:19,781 --> 00:05:21,530
Who's that man
he's talking to?

81
00:05:22,118 --> 00:05:23,749
<i>His name is
Richard Alpert.</i>

82
00:05:24,182 --> 00:05:25,341
He's a kind of...

83
00:05:27,237 --> 00:05:28,414
Advisor.

84
00:05:30,061 --> 00:05:34,427
And he has had that job
for a <i>very, very,</i> long time.

85
00:05:40,381 --> 00:05:41,817
Sun?
What are you...

86
00:05:44,574 --> 00:05:46,790
Were you here
in 1977?

87
00:05:48,684 --> 00:05:49,519
Excuse me?

88
00:05:50,605 --> 00:05:51,647
These people...

89
00:05:52,024 --> 00:05:55,419
Jack Shephard, Kate Austen,
Hugo Reyes.

90
00:05:55,604 --> 00:05:57,715
They were here
with my husband--

91
00:05:57,809 --> 00:05:58,760
Jin Kwon.

92
00:05:59,992 --> 00:06:00,900
Were you here?

93
00:06:02,863 --> 00:06:05,051
Do you remember them?
A-any of them?

94
00:06:07,732 --> 00:06:10,527
Yes, I was here...
30 years ago.

95
00:06:10,562 --> 00:06:11,997
And I do.
I remember these people.

96
00:06:12,032 --> 00:06:14,983
I remember meeting them
very clearly, because...

97
00:06:18,911 --> 00:06:20,229
I watched them
all die.

98
00:06:35,588 --> 00:06:39,158
S05E15:
Follow The Leader

99
00:06:54,253 --> 00:06:55,201
Drink of water?

100
00:06:57,242 --> 00:06:58,456
Do you think
it's true?

101
00:06:59,246 --> 00:07:00,317
They're all dead?

102
00:07:01,148 --> 00:07:03,420
I don't think we went through
all this for nothing, Sun.

103
00:07:04,013 --> 00:07:04,914
<i>I'm ready,
John.</i>

104
00:07:08,419 --> 00:07:10,241
You still have
that compass I gave you?

105
00:07:16,178 --> 00:07:18,476
A little rusty,
but she can still find north.

106
00:07:20,586 --> 00:07:22,450
Ben, I'd appreciate it
if you'd join us.

107
00:07:22,671 --> 00:07:23,778
What, John,
don't you trust me here

108
00:07:23,816 --> 00:07:24,992
with
my former people?

109
00:07:26,589 --> 00:07:27,914
Afraid I'll stage a coup?

110
00:07:28,004 --> 00:07:30,343
I'm not afraid of anything
you can do anymore, Ben.

111
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:35,598
Well, in that case,
I'd <i>love</i> to come.

112
00:07:35,621 --> 00:07:36,366
Good.

113
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:39,596
Stay here.

114
00:07:39,855 --> 00:07:41,110
We'll be back
in a couple of hours.

115
00:07:41,136 --> 00:07:42,403
I'll see what
I can find out.

116
00:07:43,282 --> 00:07:44,401
But whatever happens,
Sun,

117
00:07:44,436 --> 00:07:45,309
you have my word.

118
00:07:45,524 --> 00:07:47,695
If there's a way for you and Jin
to be together again,

119
00:07:48,311 --> 00:07:49,776
If there's a way
to save our people...

120
00:07:52,329 --> 00:07:53,298
I'll find it.

121
00:08:05,373 --> 00:08:06,750
Take it easy on her.

122
00:08:09,422 --> 00:08:10,558
Don't talk.

123
00:08:11,043 --> 00:08:12,119
Understand?

124
00:08:20,332 --> 00:08:21,312
Are you okay?

125
00:08:24,872 --> 00:08:25,440
Yeah.

126
00:08:31,809 --> 00:08:33,257
You know,
before we were caught...

127
00:08:36,026 --> 00:08:37,310
You said
that we needed

128
00:08:37,372 --> 00:08:39,939
to put things back the way
they were supposed to be.

129
00:08:44,186 --> 00:08:45,574
What did you mean
by that?

130
00:08:47,764 --> 00:08:49,324
If we can do
what Faraday said...

131
00:08:51,163 --> 00:08:52,759
Our plane
never crashes...

132
00:08:54,029 --> 00:08:56,426
Flight 815
lands in Los Angeles.

133
00:08:56,632 --> 00:08:59,926
<i>And everyone we lost
since we got here...</i>

134
00:09:03,557 --> 00:09:04,788
They'd all be alive.

135
00:09:05,901 --> 00:09:07,101
And what about us?

136
00:09:10,161 --> 00:09:11,103
We just...

137
00:09:11,546 --> 00:09:13,778
go on
living our life

138
00:09:14,252 --> 00:09:17,023
because
we've never met?

139
00:09:18,693 --> 00:09:20,773
All the misery
that we've been through...

140
00:09:21,231 --> 00:09:23,813
We'd just wipe it clean.
Never happened.

141
00:09:24,010 --> 00:09:25,922
It was <i>not</i>
all misery.

142
00:09:32,894 --> 00:09:34,142
Enough of it was.

143
00:09:43,754 --> 00:09:45,059
The man I shot...

144
00:09:46,265 --> 00:09:47,603
What did he need
the bomb for?

145
00:09:53,952 --> 00:09:55,922
I need you to tell me
why he wanted the bomb.

146
00:09:57,577 --> 00:09:59,378
I don't think you'd believe me
if I did.

147
00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:08,505
When I was
17 years old,

148
00:10:09,341 --> 00:10:11,887
I took a young man
to the bomb.

149
00:10:12,508 --> 00:10:15,197
He proceeded to tell me that
if we buried it underground,

150
00:10:15,466 --> 00:10:17,331
then things would work out
splendidly.

151
00:10:17,738 --> 00:10:20,193
When I asked him
how he could be so sure...

152
00:10:22,309 --> 00:10:24,289
He said that he was
from the future.

153
00:10:28,086 --> 00:10:29,358
And then
he disappeared,

154
00:10:31,268 --> 00:10:33,050
right in front
of my bloody eyes.

155
00:10:34,393 --> 00:10:35,220
Ten minutes ago,

156
00:10:35,255 --> 00:10:38,313
I shot that man
in the back.

157
00:10:39,825 --> 00:10:41,871
And before he
died...

158
00:10:44,513 --> 00:10:45,418
He told me
that he...

159
00:10:47,516 --> 00:10:48,784
He said
he was my son.

160
00:10:52,454 --> 00:10:53,872
Explain to me...

161
00:10:55,454 --> 00:10:57,587
And you have my word
I <i>will</i> believe you.

162
00:11:02,908 --> 00:11:06,378
How is this my handwriting
if I don't remember writing it?

163
00:11:13,357 --> 00:11:15,118
Because you haven't
written it yet.

164
00:11:17,307 --> 00:11:18,954
I know this is
hard to understand,

165
00:11:19,415 --> 00:11:20,184
but...

166
00:11:21,718 --> 00:11:23,161
What you just did...

167
00:11:24,985 --> 00:11:26,233
It was an accident,

168
00:11:26,985 --> 00:11:29,790
and I think that there's a way
for you to take it all back.

169
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:32,954
What?

170
00:11:33,523 --> 00:11:34,848
Your son
came back here

171
00:11:34,961 --> 00:11:36,687
because he had
figured out a way...

172
00:11:37,835 --> 00:11:39,164
to change things.

173
00:11:39,688 --> 00:11:40,813
He doesn't have
to be dead.

174
00:11:40,854 --> 00:11:42,816
You don't have
to have killed him.

175
00:11:43,603 --> 00:11:45,631
If we do what's written
in that journal...

176
00:11:48,581 --> 00:11:49,998
None of this
will have happened.

177
00:11:54,770 --> 00:11:56,284
Does he know
what he's talking about?

178
00:11:57,761 --> 00:11:59,033
He thinks he does.

179
00:12:08,857 --> 00:12:11,961
All right then,
I'll take you to the bomb.

180
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:14,963
<i>Just...</i>

181
00:12:15,596 --> 00:12:17,239
One small issue,
however.

182
00:12:19,163 --> 00:12:21,395
We secured it over
20 years ago underground.

183
00:12:21,930 --> 00:12:23,163
But since that time,

184
00:12:23,755 --> 00:12:26,587
it appears that someone's built
an entire village over it.

185
00:12:29,516 --> 00:12:30,649
The Dharma Initiative?

186
00:12:32,604 --> 00:12:33,359
<i>However...</i>

187
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:35,337
It appears that you two
have been

188
00:12:35,372 --> 00:12:36,928
passing yourselves off
as members, so...

189
00:12:38,316 --> 00:12:41,028
I suppose coming and going
will be relatively simple.

190
00:12:42,936 --> 00:12:45,336
Ah, it might be a little bit
more complicated than that.

191
00:13:00,024 --> 00:13:02,723
That woman--
Where is she now?

192
00:13:05,508 --> 00:13:06,714
Call my lawyer.

193
00:13:08,430 --> 00:13:10,900
Stuart! What the hell
are you doing?

194
00:13:10,961 --> 00:13:13,233
I'm getting answers.
Where is she?!

195
00:13:17,257 --> 00:13:18,644
<i>Hey. Hey!
Stop!</i>

196
00:13:19,010 --> 00:13:20,080
Damn it, <i>stop.</i>

197
00:13:20,101 --> 00:13:22,555
That is an order.
I'm still in charge here.

198
00:13:22,601 --> 00:13:24,513
No, you <i>were</i>
in charge, Horace.

199
00:13:25,151 --> 00:13:26,529
But if we're gonna
protect our people

200
00:13:26,610 --> 00:13:27,915
and all the work
we're doing here...

201
00:13:28,679 --> 00:13:30,908
You don't have the stomach
for what happens next.

202
00:13:37,579 --> 00:13:38,358
Phil.

203
00:13:48,753 --> 00:13:50,142
Okay, Jim,
last chance.

204
00:13:51,612 --> 00:13:52,933
You tell me where she is...

205
00:13:57,997 --> 00:14:00,041
Or so help me God,
I will kill you.

206
00:14:05,177 --> 00:14:05,858
Hey!

207
00:14:07,262 --> 00:14:08,379
You ready
to talk now?

208
00:14:11,627 --> 00:14:12,451
Nope.

209
00:14:14,741 --> 00:14:16,351
<i>Believe me,
I'm gettin' tired of this too, Jim.</i>

210
00:14:17,237 --> 00:14:18,138
<i>So why don't you
tell me...</i>

211
00:14:19,071 --> 00:14:20,537
Where your girlfriend
took the boy?

212
00:14:20,781 --> 00:14:22,121
She bring him
to the hostiles?

213
00:14:24,003 --> 00:14:24,838
You know
where they are?

214
00:14:30,736 --> 00:14:32,960
Aah! Stop!

215
00:14:33,116 --> 00:14:34,922
- Please!
- You want me to stop?

216
00:14:35,244 --> 00:14:36,706
Then tell me
what I want to know!

217
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:39,336
Stuart, <i>please.</i>

218
00:14:39,618 --> 00:14:42,661
We have known each other
for three years.

219
00:14:43,364 --> 00:14:44,991
We are <i>not</i>
bad people!

220
00:14:45,023 --> 00:14:46,736
We are <i>not</i> here
to hurt you!

221
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:48,099
Juliet...

222
00:14:50,229 --> 00:14:50,976
Don't.

223
00:14:53,904 --> 00:14:55,539
Whatever
you tell 'em,

224
00:14:55,626 --> 00:14:56,923
they ain't
gonna believe you.

225
00:14:59,135 --> 00:15:00,673
It's only gonna get
more people hurt.

226
00:15:03,775 --> 00:15:04,979
What are we doing,
man?

227
00:15:06,363 --> 00:15:07,959
<i>Beating him is pointless.</i>

228
00:15:08,179 --> 00:15:10,559
Okay?
He's not gonna talk.

229
00:15:10,754 --> 00:15:11,714
I can make him talk.

230
00:15:20,921 --> 00:15:22,421
Son of a bitch!

231
00:15:23,238 --> 00:15:23,989
Easy.

232
00:15:24,042 --> 00:15:25,345
You're a dead man,
Phil.

233
00:15:29,382 --> 00:15:30,810
I'm gonna kill you.

234
00:15:31,446 --> 00:15:32,357
<i>Mr. Radzinsky?</i>

235
00:15:32,816 --> 00:15:34,492
There's still no sign
of Miles or Jin.

236
00:15:35,239 --> 00:15:36,733
But the recruits
from last week...

237
00:15:37,348 --> 00:15:39,195
I got their sub's manifest
from Amy.

238
00:15:39,346 --> 00:15:41,129
There were
three last-minute add-ons.

239
00:15:41,174 --> 00:15:42,670
They were the two people
that shot at you.

240
00:15:42,752 --> 00:15:45,559
Shephard and Austen.
And one guy we can't track down.

241
00:15:45,651 --> 00:15:47,035
He's gotta be
a part of this.

242
00:15:50,077 --> 00:15:51,745
Who the hell is
Hugo Reyes?

243
00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:53,700
He's the fat guy.

244
00:16:16,584 --> 00:16:17,395
<i>Hurry up!</i>

245
00:16:31,063 --> 00:16:31,968
So what's the rescue plan?

246
00:16:32,017 --> 00:16:32,919
<i>Rescue plan?</i>

247
00:16:32,994 --> 00:16:33,800
We're heading
to the beach.

248
00:16:33,841 --> 00:16:35,203
Why do you think
we sent you for food?

249
00:16:35,906 --> 00:16:37,275
But they got
Sawyer and Juliet.

250
00:16:38,670 --> 00:16:41,151
And there are 30 of them,
and they all have guns.

251
00:16:41,186 --> 00:16:42,834
The only people we can
rescue is our ourselves,

252
00:16:42,769 --> 00:16:44,430
- <i>so let's go.</i>
- We gotta do something.

253
00:16:44,771 --> 00:16:46,275
I mean, Sawyer would never
leave us behind.

254
00:16:53,996 --> 00:16:56,568
Dr. Chang?
What are you doing here?

255
00:16:58,406 --> 00:16:59,820
I could ask you
the same question.

256
00:17:01,530 --> 00:17:02,633
But we asked you first.

257
00:17:04,686 --> 00:17:05,799
Your friend Faraday...

258
00:17:06,458 --> 00:17:07,754
said that you were
from the future.

259
00:17:08,364 --> 00:17:10,103
I need to know
if he was telling the truth.

260
00:17:13,473 --> 00:17:14,600
Dude,
that's ridiculous.

261
00:17:16,217 --> 00:17:17,383
What year
were you born?

262
00:17:18,436 --> 00:17:19,271
What year?

263
00:17:19,317 --> 00:17:21,379
Uh... 1931?

264
00:17:21,435 --> 00:17:22,458
You're 46?

265
00:17:23,357 --> 00:17:24,227
Yeah.

266
00:17:25,006 --> 00:17:25,566
Yes, I am.

267
00:17:25,607 --> 00:17:27,352
So you fought
in the Korean War?

268
00:17:29,495 --> 00:17:31,162
There's no such thing.

269
00:17:33,588 --> 00:17:35,439
Who's the President
of the United States?

270
00:17:38,221 --> 00:17:39,420
All right, dude,
we're from the future.

271
00:17:39,659 --> 00:17:40,644
Sorry.

272
00:17:45,009 --> 00:17:46,017
It's true then?

273
00:17:49,041 --> 00:17:50,369
You are my son?

274
00:17:53,851 --> 00:17:54,907
Yeah, it's true.

275
00:17:58,863 --> 00:18:00,701
Your friend,
the physicist--

276
00:18:01,086 --> 00:18:03,790
He also told me to evacuate
everyone I could off the island.

277
00:18:04,137 --> 00:18:05,175
He said
there was going to be

278
00:18:05,211 --> 00:18:06,945
a massive accident
at the Swan.

279
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:08,072
Now is that true?

280
00:18:11,761 --> 00:18:13,550
He's been right
about everything so far.

281
00:18:14,389 --> 00:18:16,599
If Faraday said
get people off the island...

282
00:18:20,465 --> 00:18:21,397
I'd do it.

283
00:18:24,478 --> 00:18:27,195
Well, then let's hope
he knows what he's doing.

284
00:18:35,077 --> 00:18:36,459
Tell me something.

285
00:18:37,414 --> 00:18:40,211
Why is it that
this man looks...

286
00:18:41,482 --> 00:18:42,833
familiar to me?

287
00:18:44,021 --> 00:18:44,805
<i>Richard...</i>

288
00:18:45,479 --> 00:18:46,738
You and Erik
are coming with me.

289
00:18:48,082 --> 00:18:49,116
Going with you
where?

290
00:18:50,077 --> 00:18:51,201
You can untie them.

291
00:18:51,815 --> 00:18:52,440
<i>And...</i>

292
00:18:52,842 --> 00:18:54,387
Would you mind
giving us a moment?

293
00:19:08,275 --> 00:19:09,444
I'm taking them
to the bomb.

294
00:19:09,917 --> 00:19:10,968
<i>What?</i>

295
00:19:12,611 --> 00:19:13,944
Are you insane?

296
00:19:15,281 --> 00:19:16,227
All right.

297
00:19:17,745 --> 00:19:19,165
I'm worried about you.
Not in your condition.

298
00:19:24,718 --> 00:19:25,609
Who is he?

299
00:19:30,133 --> 00:19:32,825
The man you're asking about, Jack,
is Charles Widmore.

300
00:19:35,629 --> 00:19:37,027
He and Eloise are...

301
00:19:39,430 --> 00:19:41,962
Well, let's just say
love can be complicated.

302
00:19:47,908 --> 00:19:49,964
All right.
Let's move out.

303
00:19:55,474 --> 00:19:56,268
So, John...

304
00:19:57,069 --> 00:19:58,446
You, uh,
you ready to tell me

305
00:19:58,481 --> 00:20:00,057
where you've been
the last three years?

306
00:20:02,144 --> 00:20:03,309
You really don't know?

307
00:20:05,217 --> 00:20:08,563
Well, I know that on the day
that Ben here turned the wheel,

308
00:20:08,598 --> 00:20:10,444
that you and I were
sitting on a log.

309
00:20:11,270 --> 00:20:12,904
There was a bright light.

310
00:20:12,939 --> 00:20:15,013
There was a loud noise,
and then you just...

311
00:20:15,604 --> 00:20:16,774
You disappeared.

312
00:20:17,380 --> 00:20:19,911
Well, Richard, you're just about
to see where I disappeared to.

313
00:20:20,879 --> 00:20:21,871
And after we're finished
with that,

314
00:20:21,906 --> 00:20:23,486
I'd like you
to take me to see Jacob.

315
00:20:26,847 --> 00:20:29,674
That's... not how it works,
John.

316
00:20:30,476 --> 00:20:32,589
Is that true, Richard?
Is this gonna be a problem?

317
00:20:34,210 --> 00:20:35,542
You just got back,
John.

318
00:20:35,579 --> 00:20:36,861
There's no reason
to rush into--

319
00:20:36,897 --> 00:20:39,578
I am the leader now.
Right?

320
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:43,500
Yes, John.
That's right.

321
00:20:43,921 --> 00:20:45,746
Good. Then I would like you
to take me to Jacob.

322
00:20:45,781 --> 00:20:46,626
Can you do that?

323
00:20:48,681 --> 00:20:49,524
Yeah, of course.

324
00:20:50,188 --> 00:20:51,165
Fantastic.

325
00:20:51,815 --> 00:20:53,289
Let's keep moving.
We're almost to the plane.

326
00:20:55,949 --> 00:20:57,058
<i>What</i> plane?

327
00:21:16,951 --> 00:21:18,196
It's a beachcraft...

328
00:21:18,801 --> 00:21:19,865
<i>used to
smuggle heroin.</i>

329
00:21:19,886 --> 00:21:21,541
<i>Flew out of Nigeria,
crashed here.</i>

330
00:21:23,328 --> 00:21:24,792
All right, Richard,
listen very carefully

331
00:21:24,829 --> 00:21:26,025
because you're only
gonna have about...

332
00:21:26,602 --> 00:21:28,013
three minutes
to get this right.

333
00:21:28,268 --> 00:21:29,232
To get what right?

334
00:21:29,540 --> 00:21:31,479
A man's about to
walk out of the jungle.

335
00:21:32,114 --> 00:21:33,530
He's been
shot in the leg.

336
00:21:36,613 --> 00:21:38,050
You'll need this
to get the bullet out.

337
00:21:40,869 --> 00:21:42,163
Uh, I'm sorry, John.
I'm not--

338
00:21:42,215 --> 00:21:44,018
Now just listen.
This is the important part.

339
00:21:45,159 --> 00:21:46,285
You're gonna need
to tell him

340
00:21:46,326 --> 00:21:50,493
that he has to bring everyone
who left back to the island.

341
00:21:51,064 --> 00:21:52,674
And when he asks
how to do that...

342
00:21:54,525 --> 00:21:56,361
You tell him
he's gonna have to die.

343
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:11,052
Who is that man,
John?

344
00:22:12,974 --> 00:22:13,879
Me.

345
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:29,576
Aah!

346
00:22:44,328 --> 00:22:45,301
Richard?

347
00:22:46,385 --> 00:22:47,392
Richard...

348
00:22:48,446 --> 00:22:49,674
What is happening?

349
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:51,775
What's happening is
that you're bleeding to death.

350
00:22:53,770 --> 00:22:54,637
Okay, here.

351
00:22:59,020 --> 00:23:00,719
I need to
get the bullet out.

352
00:23:04,444 --> 00:23:06,597
How did you know there was
a bullet in my leg, Richard?

353
00:23:06,874 --> 00:23:08,473
Because you told me
there was, John.

354
00:23:08,662 --> 00:23:10,639
No, no.
No, I didn't.

355
00:23:12,062 --> 00:23:13,787
Well... You will.

356
00:23:17,334 --> 00:23:20,088
This must be quite
the out-of-body experience.

357
00:23:20,590 --> 00:23:21,678
Something like that.

358
00:23:22,593 --> 00:23:25,209
Your timing was impeccable,
John.

359
00:23:25,269 --> 00:23:27,351
How did you know
<i>when</i> to be here?

360
00:23:29,327 --> 00:23:30,727
The island told me.

361
00:23:32,426 --> 00:23:33,916
Didn't it ever
tell you things?

362
00:23:33,942 --> 00:23:34,867
No, John.

363
00:23:35,602 --> 00:23:37,607
And clearly it hasn't
told you where Jacob is,

364
00:23:37,642 --> 00:23:39,162
or you wouldn't need
Richard to show you.

365
00:23:39,163 --> 00:23:40,714
You've never seen him.

366
00:23:40,945 --> 00:23:41,717
<i>What?</i>

367
00:23:41,768 --> 00:23:42,520
Jacob.

368
00:23:43,275 --> 00:23:44,636
You've never seen him,
have you?

369
00:23:55,088 --> 00:23:55,901
What just happened?

370
00:23:57,925 --> 00:23:59,274
Where did you go?

371
00:23:59,452 --> 00:24:01,104
To give Richard
his compass back.

372
00:24:08,711 --> 00:24:09,908
You want the bullet?

373
00:24:10,832 --> 00:24:11,714
Keep it.

374
00:24:13,387 --> 00:24:14,449
Everything go all right?

375
00:24:14,687 --> 00:24:15,340
Well, you...

376
00:24:15,468 --> 00:24:16,576
You seemed
pretty convinced,

377
00:24:17,159 --> 00:24:18,709
especially when I said
you were gonna die.

378
00:24:18,983 --> 00:24:20,766
I'm certainly glad
<i>that</i> didn't have to happen.

379
00:24:22,770 --> 00:24:25,712
Actually, Richard,
it <i>did.</i>

380
00:24:32,141 --> 00:24:33,646
We better get back
to camp.

381
00:24:44,108 --> 00:24:46,500
You need to evacuate the island
of all non-essential personnel,

382
00:24:46,557 --> 00:24:47,600
and you need to do it...

383
00:24:50,221 --> 00:24:51,548
<i>What the hell
is going on here?</i>

384
00:24:51,589 --> 00:24:53,443
<i>Aren't you supposed to be
at the Swan right now, Chang?</i>

385
00:24:53,489 --> 00:24:55,649
We're supposed to break ground
in less than 20 hours.

386
00:24:55,681 --> 00:24:57,197
We're under
imminent threat.

387
00:24:57,481 --> 00:24:58,980
If we start drilling,

388
00:24:59,047 --> 00:25:01,642
there's a high probability
of a cataclysmic accident.

389
00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:03,988
We <i>are</i> drilling
and on schedule.

390
00:25:05,247 --> 00:25:08,568
- Horace, you're in charge.
- He's not in charge anymore.

391
00:25:10,343 --> 00:25:12,945
This is <i>my</i> decision,
and it's been made.

392
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:15,701
- <i>We keep working.</i>
- Put us on the sub.

393
00:25:21,108 --> 00:25:23,705
He's right.
It ain't safe.

394
00:25:25,118 --> 00:25:26,646
Put the women and children
on the sub

395
00:25:26,681 --> 00:25:27,867
and get 'em
the hell out of here.

396
00:25:34,259 --> 00:25:36,437
And if you put me and Juliet
on the sub with 'em...

397
00:25:37,949 --> 00:25:39,583
We'll tell you anything
you wanna know.

398
00:25:46,416 --> 00:25:48,010
You okay with that,
sweetheart?

399
00:25:49,470 --> 00:25:50,749
Absolutely.

400
00:25:51,216 --> 00:25:52,629
You want on that sub,
Jim?

401
00:25:59,396 --> 00:26:00,387
Draw me a map.

402
00:26:01,092 --> 00:26:03,606
I wanna know <i>exactly</i> where
the hostiles are.

403
00:26:16,681 --> 00:26:18,438
You two
know how to swim?

404
00:26:20,048 --> 00:26:21,457
Why don't we just
go around it?

405
00:26:21,739 --> 00:26:23,290
No, dear,
we need to go in.

406
00:26:24,102 --> 00:26:26,528
We have to swim under the pond
to get to the tunnels.

407
00:26:27,534 --> 00:26:28,681
I'm not going.

408
00:26:30,269 --> 00:26:30,925
What?

409
00:26:31,019 --> 00:26:32,694
I'm gonna go back
and find everyone else. I...

410
00:26:33,846 --> 00:26:36,176
I can't go any further with you,
Jack. Not this time.

411
00:26:36,222 --> 00:26:38,734
Kate, you can't go
back there now.

412
00:26:38,774 --> 00:26:39,518
They know about us.

413
00:26:39,580 --> 00:26:41,741
They...
tried to kill us.

414
00:26:42,665 --> 00:26:43,888
And what are <i>you</i>
trying to do?

415
00:26:47,873 --> 00:26:48,897
Bye, Jack.

416
00:26:50,783 --> 00:26:52,438
- You're not going anywhere.
- No, you don't need to do <i>that.</i>

417
00:26:52,473 --> 00:26:55,284
We're not in the habit of
telling our secrets to strangers

418
00:26:55,319 --> 00:26:56,855
<i>then just letting them
saunter off.</i>

419
00:26:56,922 --> 00:26:58,869
You know,
I don't care about your secrets.

420
00:26:58,915 --> 00:26:59,946
I just wanna leave.

421
00:27:00,005 --> 00:27:01,264
- Look, just put the gun--
- Step away!

422
00:27:01,310 --> 00:27:02,153
If she
wants to leave,

423
00:27:02,178 --> 00:27:03,604
- she can leave!
- Hey, I said stop!

424
00:27:24,831 --> 00:27:26,349
What are we doing here,
Eloise?

425
00:27:26,705 --> 00:27:28,370
That man just killed
one of our own people,

426
00:27:28,405 --> 00:27:30,190
and you're acting like
it doesn't matter.

427
00:27:30,241 --> 00:27:31,175
If these people
are right

428
00:27:31,217 --> 00:27:33,381
about what they're
about to do, Richard...

429
00:27:33,969 --> 00:27:34,931
It won't matter.

430
00:27:35,093 --> 00:27:36,160
And what are they
about to do?

431
00:27:38,095 --> 00:27:39,233
<i>So you're telling me,</i>

432
00:27:39,285 --> 00:27:41,863
you're going to erase the last
three years of our lives?

433
00:27:41,910 --> 00:27:43,312
We can change things,
Sayid.

434
00:27:43,369 --> 00:27:44,706
I don't know
if you're aware of this,

435
00:27:44,742 --> 00:27:46,391
but I've already
changed things.

436
00:27:47,509 --> 00:27:49,152
I killed
Benjamin Linus,

437
00:27:50,107 --> 00:27:51,489
and we're all
still here.

438
00:27:51,533 --> 00:27:52,959
It's because
you didn't kill him.

439
00:27:53,848 --> 00:27:55,396
Sawyer and me took him
to the Others

440
00:27:55,437 --> 00:27:56,419
so that
they could save him.

441
00:28:02,324 --> 00:28:03,523
Why did you do that?

442
00:28:03,568 --> 00:28:04,910
Why did I do that?

443
00:28:05,998 --> 00:28:08,941
Since when did shooting kids
and blowing up hydrogen bombs

444
00:28:08,966 --> 00:28:09,956
become okay?

445
00:28:11,126 --> 00:28:13,712
The three of us disappeared off
that plane and ended up here,

446
00:28:13,775 --> 00:28:15,769
ended up <i>now,</i>
because this is our chance

447
00:28:15,794 --> 00:28:16,959
to change things.

448
00:28:17,185 --> 00:28:20,403
And if you're <i>wrong,</i>
then everyone on the island dies.

449
00:28:20,456 --> 00:28:21,454
Do you understand that?

450
00:28:21,499 --> 00:28:25,010
I'm not wrong, Kate. This is it.
This is why we're here.

451
00:28:29,377 --> 00:28:30,666
This is our destiny.

452
00:28:30,856 --> 00:28:32,446
Do you know
who you sound like?

453
00:28:35,188 --> 00:28:36,668
Because he was crazy,
too, Jack.

454
00:28:36,705 --> 00:28:37,951
You said so yourself.

455
00:28:38,718 --> 00:28:40,069
Well,
maybe I was wrong.

456
00:28:40,110 --> 00:28:41,209
No,
you were right.

457
00:28:44,820 --> 00:28:46,730
I'm going back to find
the rest of our people,

458
00:28:46,777 --> 00:28:49,293
because if I can't stop you,
then maybe they can.

459
00:28:58,749 --> 00:29:00,775
<i>The submarine departs
in 30 minutes.</i>

460
00:29:01,241 --> 00:29:03,624
<i>All evacuees,
please proceed to the dock.</i>

461
00:29:07,237 --> 00:29:08,173
Come now,
Charlotte.

462
00:29:08,390 --> 00:29:10,036
Come on, now.
Just stay with me.

463
00:29:13,252 --> 00:29:15,592
This is ridiculous.
I can help you.

464
00:29:15,634 --> 00:29:17,427
No, Lara, you can't.
Just go over there.

465
00:29:18,009 --> 00:29:19,009
<i>At least some day.</i>

466
00:29:19,152 --> 00:29:22,111
I want you to
<i>leave now!</i>

467
00:29:22,182 --> 00:29:23,376
Why is he yelling
at her, dude?

468
00:29:26,634 --> 00:29:28,822
It's the only way
he can get her to leave.

469
00:29:31,622 --> 00:29:32,697
Sorry, man.

470
00:29:33,252 --> 00:29:34,182
We'd better get moving.

471
00:29:34,233 --> 00:29:35,725
Wait! Whoa! Whoa!
Wait--wait a second.

472
00:29:37,395 --> 00:29:38,595
<i>It's Jim and Juliet.</i>

473
00:29:39,588 --> 00:29:40,762
Why the hell
are they...

474
00:29:41,591 --> 00:29:42,878
putting them
on the sub?

475
00:29:48,227 --> 00:29:50,169
<i>Don't worry.
It's gonna be okay.</i>

476
00:29:50,461 --> 00:29:52,025
Sawyer always has a plan,
right?

477
00:29:57,401 --> 00:29:58,892
We'll buy Microsoft.

478
00:29:59,434 --> 00:30:00,444
Excuse me?

479
00:30:01,475 --> 00:30:04,221
Then we'll bet the Cowboys
in the '78 Super Bowl.

480
00:30:04,892 --> 00:30:06,339
We're gonna be rich.

481
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:10,591
Look, I'm sorry.

482
00:30:11,507 --> 00:30:12,545
I should've
listened to you

483
00:30:12,595 --> 00:30:14,643
when you wanted to get
on this sub three years ago.

484
00:30:16,141 --> 00:30:17,623
I'm glad you talked me
out of it.

485
00:30:25,054 --> 00:30:26,857
Come on, LaFleur.
Get in.

486
00:30:29,715 --> 00:30:30,960
Ladies first.

487
00:30:51,252 --> 00:30:52,376
Good riddance.

488
00:31:08,489 --> 00:31:09,397
Phew!

489
00:31:10,133 --> 00:31:11,448
If I don't see you on
the other side,

490
00:31:12,429 --> 00:31:13,565
I won't blame you.

491
00:31:17,706 --> 00:31:20,905
Now take a deep breath
and follow Richard under.

492
00:31:22,214 --> 00:31:24,891
There's an opening in the bottom
of the rocks at the far side.

493
00:32:15,938 --> 00:32:17,411
That was a lot further
than I thought it was.

494
00:32:20,095 --> 00:32:20,925
Where are we?

495
00:32:22,249 --> 00:32:23,142
The tunnels.

496
00:32:26,322 --> 00:32:27,054
You wanna
tell me how

497
00:32:27,085 --> 00:32:28,246
we're gonna get a bomb
out of here?

498
00:32:29,676 --> 00:32:30,882
The same way
we brought it in.

499
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:34,400
I assume you don't mean
through the pool.

500
00:32:34,491 --> 00:32:37,517
It's a 12-foot long,
40,000-pound hydrogen bomb.

501
00:32:37,612 --> 00:32:38,850
No, not through the pool.

502
00:33:02,140 --> 00:33:03,005
I didn't think
you'd come.

503
00:33:04,379 --> 00:33:07,033
Well, if this works,
you might just save us all.

504
00:33:07,744 --> 00:33:08,701
And if it doesn't?

505
00:33:09,295 --> 00:33:10,939
At least you'll put us
out of our misery.

506
00:33:20,716 --> 00:33:23,400
All right.
Let's get started.

507
00:33:45,892 --> 00:33:46,657
<i>You're back.</i>

508
00:34:00,949 --> 00:34:01,760
<i>I'll have a...</i>

509
00:34:01,806 --> 00:34:02,963
tent prepared for you,
John.

510
00:34:03,121 --> 00:34:04,596
We'll get going
first thing in the morning.

511
00:34:04,945 --> 00:34:06,230
I thought we could leave
right now.

512
00:34:07,579 --> 00:34:08,594
<i>Now?</i>

513
00:34:09,278 --> 00:34:10,449
I'm eager.

514
00:34:16,515 --> 00:34:17,510
We can do
whatever you want,

515
00:34:17,611 --> 00:34:19,310
but maybe the two of us
should go to my tent

516
00:34:19,345 --> 00:34:20,588
- and talk about--
- Is this everyone?

517
00:34:22,523 --> 00:34:24,140
Well, there's another group
at the Temple, but--

518
00:34:24,181 --> 00:34:24,873
If you don't mind,

519
00:34:24,923 --> 00:34:27,780
I would like to talk
to everyone here <i>now.</i>

520
00:34:30,057 --> 00:34:32,246
Of course.
Be my guest.

521
00:34:39,621 --> 00:34:40,544
Hello, everyone.

522
00:34:41,381 --> 00:34:42,974
My name is
John Locke.

523
00:34:44,288 --> 00:34:45,276
<i>I've been told that...</i>

524
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:47,483
For some time,

525
00:34:47,549 --> 00:34:50,460
you all have been accepting
orders from a man named Jacob.

526
00:34:51,686 --> 00:34:53,052
And yet,
oddly enough,

527
00:34:53,108 --> 00:34:54,964
it seems that no one
has actually <i>seen</i> him.

528
00:34:56,017 --> 00:34:56,592
<i>Now...</i>

529
00:34:56,686 --> 00:34:58,064
I'm sure
there are very good reasons

530
00:34:58,109 --> 00:35:01,330
why his existence
and whereabouts are secret.

531
00:35:01,496 --> 00:35:03,786
I just don't know
what they are.

532
00:35:08,172 --> 00:35:09,486
And to be honest
with all of you,

533
00:35:09,537 --> 00:35:11,003
if there's a man telling us
what to do,

534
00:35:11,069 --> 00:35:12,888
I want to know
who he is.

535
00:35:14,523 --> 00:35:16,760
This man--
Jacob?

536
00:35:17,297 --> 00:35:18,859
Can he tell us
how to bring Jin

537
00:35:18,921 --> 00:35:20,776
and the rest
of our people back here?

538
00:35:20,837 --> 00:35:21,902
Absolutely.

539
00:35:27,314 --> 00:35:29,855
Richard has agreed
to show us where we need to go.

540
00:35:30,099 --> 00:35:32,830
So I'm gonna go and see Jacob,
right now.

541
00:35:37,497 --> 00:35:39,767
And I'd like all of you
to come with me.

542
00:35:51,643 --> 00:35:54,007
I'm starting to think John Locke
is gonna be trouble.

543
00:35:56,075 --> 00:35:57,752
Why do you think
I tried to kill him?

544
00:36:13,278 --> 00:36:14,676
We're shovin' off
in two minutes.

545
00:36:15,003 --> 00:36:16,649
Appreciate it if you didn't
cause us any trouble.

546
00:36:18,100 --> 00:36:19,755
Wouldn't think of it,
Nemo.

547
00:36:21,844 --> 00:36:23,910
What are we gonna do
when we get to Ann Arbor?

548
00:36:26,299 --> 00:36:27,690
We ain't going to
Ann Arbor.

549
00:36:27,998 --> 00:36:30,334
- What do you mean?
- These guys ain't cops.

550
00:36:30,376 --> 00:36:32,798
They got no authority over us
back in the real world.

551
00:36:35,126 --> 00:36:37,398
So once we dock
wherever we dock...

552
00:36:38,641 --> 00:36:39,646
We're free.

553
00:36:40,855 --> 00:36:41,896
"Real world."

554
00:36:45,704 --> 00:36:47,520
I don't even know
what that means anymore.

555
00:36:50,591 --> 00:36:51,555
Hey, come here.

556
00:36:58,831 --> 00:37:02,100
Whatever happens,
I got your back, remember?

557
00:37:04,369 --> 00:37:05,339
I love you.

558
00:37:07,289 --> 00:37:09,130
Well,
I love you back.

559
00:37:09,279 --> 00:37:10,650
<i>Hold on!
Don't close the hatch!</i>

560
00:37:11,294 --> 00:37:13,267
Horace wants <i>her</i>
off the island, too.

561
00:37:13,321 --> 00:37:14,770
We'll let Ann Arbor
deal with them.

562
00:37:16,354 --> 00:37:18,268
Actually caught her
coming back into town.

563
00:37:20,705 --> 00:37:22,068
<i>Cuff her over there
with the others.</i>

564
00:37:42,226 --> 00:37:43,061
Hey.

565
00:37:46,162 --> 00:37:46,877
Hey.

566
00:37:53,398 --> 00:37:54,298
<i>Clear the bridge.</i>

567
00:37:54,349 --> 00:37:55,238
<i>All personnel,</i>

568
00:37:55,284 --> 00:37:57,026
<i>lay below
on the double.</i>

569
00:37:57,941 --> 00:38:01,236
We're away.
Engineering, take your stations.

570
00:38:01,537 --> 00:38:02,991
<i>Boat is
clear for sea.</i>

571
00:38:03,644 --> 00:38:05,932
<i>All men to your stations.
Prepare to dive.</i>

572
00:38:07,838 --> 00:38:08,839
<i>Clear the bridge.</i>

573
00:38:08,892 --> 00:38:09,941
<i>All hands below.</i>

574
00:38:11,025 --> 00:38:12,455
Stand by main vents.

575
00:38:12,766 --> 00:38:13,851
<i>Diving position.</i>

576
00:38:17,286 --> 00:38:18,857
<i>Stand by
on ballast tanks.</i>

577
00:38:18,901 --> 00:38:19,932
<i>Ship has been cleared
for dive.</i>

578
00:38:19,987 --> 00:38:22,747
<i>Repeat, ship has been cleared
for dive. Stand by for dive.</i>

579
00:38:22,807 --> 00:38:23,461
<i>Ship to dive.</i>

580
00:38:23,837 --> 00:38:26,517
<i>Clear engines two and three.
Test two and three.</i>

581
00:38:49,230 --> 00:38:50,043
Jack.

582
00:38:52,299 --> 00:38:53,533
I'm sure
it's occurred to you

583
00:38:53,568 --> 00:38:54,780
that this
woman's motivation

584
00:38:54,831 --> 00:38:56,714
in helping us detonate
a hydrogen bomb

585
00:38:57,705 --> 00:38:59,898
is only to annihilate
the Dharma Initiative.

586
00:39:00,295 --> 00:39:03,606
- Yes, but I still trust her.
- Why?

587
00:39:04,837 --> 00:39:06,327
Because 30 years from now,
she's the one

588
00:39:06,362 --> 00:39:08,063
who's gonna tell us
how to get back to the island.

589
00:39:08,898 --> 00:39:10,446
And that makes
you trust her?

590
00:39:56,348 --> 00:39:57,147
Well...

591
00:39:59,326 --> 00:40:00,070
Now what?

592
00:40:38,179 --> 00:40:39,518
Beautiful day,
isn't it?

593
00:40:40,193 --> 00:40:41,593
Yes...
So far.

594
00:40:43,956 --> 00:40:45,926
Richard
had some concerns.

595
00:40:46,981 --> 00:40:48,398
Concerns about what?

596
00:40:48,951 --> 00:40:51,693
This pilgrimage to Jacob
makes him uncomfortable.

597
00:40:51,974 --> 00:40:53,506
He's expressed...

598
00:40:54,379 --> 00:40:56,056
Reservations
about whether or not

599
00:40:56,076 --> 00:40:57,435
you know what the hell
you're doing.

600
00:41:01,101 --> 00:41:03,729
I appreciate you bringing this
to my attention, Ben.

601
00:41:04,894 --> 00:41:07,002
I know we've had our differences
in the past, John,

602
00:41:07,928 --> 00:41:09,722
but I'm here
to follow you now.

603
00:41:10,410 --> 00:41:12,917
So if you need Jacob
to help you reunite your people,

604
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:14,686
- then I'll do whatever--
- I'm not interested in

605
00:41:14,727 --> 00:41:16,078
being reunited
with my people.

606
00:41:18,819 --> 00:41:20,050
What do you mean?
You told Sun--

607
00:41:20,097 --> 00:41:20,802
I know
what I told her,

608
00:41:20,837 --> 00:41:22,468
but that's not why
we're going to Jacob.

609
00:41:24,476 --> 00:41:26,256
Then why <i>are</i> we
going to Jacob?

610
00:41:27,762 --> 00:41:29,235
So I can kill him.
