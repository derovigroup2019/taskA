1
00:00:01,807 --> 00:00:03,085
Comes fully equipped.

2
00:00:05,757 --> 00:00:07,506
I'm telling you,
it's a steal at $400.

3
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:14,555
- Gotta check with your husband?
- It's just me.

4
00:00:15,624 --> 00:00:16,349
Mommy?

5
00:00:17,601 --> 00:00:21,062
- Can I have a quarter for the machine?
- Honey, I said wait for me by the pool.

6
00:00:22,231 --> 00:00:23,856
I thought you said it was "just me."

7
00:00:24,563 --> 00:00:27,902
I meant my husband's out of the picture.
It's just me and my son.

8
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:30,404
The other tenants don't like noise.

9
00:00:30,573 --> 00:00:31,614
He's very quiet.

10
00:00:32,657 --> 00:00:34,158
I'm gonna need two months up front.

11
00:00:36,878 --> 00:00:37,978
Here, honey.

12
00:00:41,751 --> 00:00:44,101
Hey, no running.
You hear me, Miles?

13
00:01:38,043 --> 00:01:39,056
Mom!

14
00:01:39,224 --> 00:01:40,307
Mommy! Help!

15
00:01:45,924 --> 00:01:46,924
Miles?

16
00:01:47,546 --> 00:01:49,734
- Miles, what happened?
- Mommy!

17
00:01:52,855 --> 00:01:53,855
God.

18
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:55,164
Mr. Vonner.

19
00:01:58,952 --> 00:02:02,580
- What were you doing in here?
- He was all alone.

20
00:02:02,923 --> 00:02:04,081
He was scared.

21
00:02:04,249 --> 00:02:07,334
His chest hurt.
He kept calling out for Kimberly.

22
00:02:07,503 --> 00:02:08,503
Kimberly?

23
00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:10,087
That's his wife.

24
00:02:11,421 --> 00:02:14,425
She died last year.
Now how would you know that?

25
00:02:14,594 --> 00:02:17,386
- I heard him.
- What are you talking about?

26
00:02:18,621 --> 00:02:20,890
He's still talking right now.

27
00:02:22,174 --> 00:02:23,174
Honey...

28
00:02:25,235 --> 00:02:26,061
He's dead.

29
00:02:26,230 --> 00:02:29,633
I told you! I can hear him!

30
00:02:30,109 --> 00:02:31,359
I can hear him!

31
00:02:32,359 --> 00:02:34,547
<i>Miles, you there? Pick up.</i>

32
00:02:35,737 --> 00:02:36,906
Where are you?

33
00:02:37,298 --> 00:02:39,742
I'll fill you in later.
I need you to take care of something.

34
00:02:39,911 --> 00:02:41,787
- <i>Like what?</i>
- The security tapes

35
00:02:41,912 --> 00:02:45,164
from the pylon camera feeds.
They need to accidentally get erased.

36
00:02:45,735 --> 00:02:46,835
Erased? Why?

37
00:02:47,171 --> 00:02:49,483
I ain't got time for questions.
Just do it.

38
00:02:50,379 --> 00:02:51,587
Which ones?

39
00:02:52,069 --> 00:02:53,214
Look on your monitors.

40
00:02:57,309 --> 00:02:58,359
<i>You see us?</i>

41
00:03:01,307 --> 00:03:04,183
Yeah. You're on number 4.
Is that Kate?

42
00:03:04,351 --> 00:03:05,935
<i>What are you doing out there?</i>

43
00:03:06,104 --> 00:03:09,024
Just erase number 4.
And if anyone asks, I'm off the grid.

44
00:03:09,149 --> 00:03:12,233
- I'm looking for the escaped hostile.
- You mean your pal Sayid?

45
00:03:12,834 --> 00:03:14,485
You gonna help me or not?!

46
00:03:15,396 --> 00:03:18,405
- Yeah, yeah. I got it.
- <i>All right. I owe you one.</i>

47
00:03:19,274 --> 00:03:20,825
You go back and and find Juliet,

48
00:03:20,994 --> 00:03:22,952
see if anyone's noticed yet
if Ben's gone missin'.

49
00:03:23,398 --> 00:03:25,711
What are you gonna do
when they find out?

50
00:03:25,836 --> 00:03:27,414
Do my best to cover it up.

51
00:03:27,583 --> 00:03:30,042
In case you haven't noticed,
I'm the head of security.

52
00:03:31,961 --> 00:03:33,661
I'll see you back there.

53
00:03:39,458 --> 00:03:40,758
Where's Lafleur?

54
00:03:41,457 --> 00:03:43,958
He's out looking for
the escaped prisoner.

55
00:03:44,083 --> 00:03:46,308
I tried to get him on his walkie,
but...

56
00:03:47,209 --> 00:03:48,519
He must be out of range.

57
00:03:49,147 --> 00:03:50,147
Damn it.

58
00:03:50,356 --> 00:03:53,065
All right.
Then it's gonna have to be you.

59
00:03:53,849 --> 00:03:55,317
Jim already knows about this,

60
00:03:55,485 --> 00:03:57,820
but I'm gonna bring you
into the circle of trust.

61
00:03:59,207 --> 00:04:00,857
Can I trust you, Miles?

62
00:04:01,335 --> 00:04:02,366
Absolutely.

63
00:04:02,534 --> 00:04:03,409
Okay. Good.

64
00:04:04,961 --> 00:04:08,634
I need you to take this out
to Radzinsky at grid 3-3-4.

65
00:04:09,230 --> 00:04:11,204
He'll give you something in return.

66
00:04:11,329 --> 00:04:14,461
I want you to bring it back to me
with no questions asked.

67
00:04:15,547 --> 00:04:16,380
Understood?

68
00:04:21,085 --> 00:04:22,678
We're not supposed to be in 3-3-4.

69
00:04:24,723 --> 00:04:26,056
Isn't that hostile territory?

70
00:04:26,834 --> 00:04:28,809
Welcome to the circle of trust.

71
00:04:42,608 --> 00:04:43,958
Stop right there!

72
00:04:47,077 --> 00:04:49,085
What are you doing here?
I was expecting Lafleur.

73
00:04:50,608 --> 00:04:53,000
Lafleur's busy.
Horace sent me instead.

74
00:04:54,517 --> 00:04:56,573
- I'm in the circle of trust.
- Get out.

75
00:05:04,544 --> 00:05:06,544
I'm supposed to give you this.

76
00:05:06,828 --> 00:05:08,474
And he said
you had something for me.

77
00:05:29,606 --> 00:05:31,107
What happened to him?

78
00:05:31,232 --> 00:05:32,682
He had an accident.

79
00:05:35,283 --> 00:05:37,586
- What kind of accident?
- He fell into a ditch.

80
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:40,172
Is that a bullet hole in his head?

81
00:05:41,670 --> 00:05:44,134
- The ditch had a gun?
- It doesn't matter what happened

82
00:05:44,571 --> 00:05:48,555
because knowing that is not your job.
Your job is to do what I tell you to.

83
00:06:04,370 --> 00:06:06,620
Take him back to Horace now, Miles.

84
00:06:31,293 --> 00:06:32,293
Okay...

85
00:06:34,855 --> 00:06:36,478
So what really happened?

86
00:06:39,342 --> 00:06:52,161
Subtitle:
www.sub-way.fr (1.00)

87
00:06:59,547 --> 00:07:00,947
I need to see her.

88
00:07:24,958 --> 00:07:25,694
Ma?

89
00:07:29,710 --> 00:07:30,710
It's me.

90
00:07:39,646 --> 00:07:40,646
Miles.

91
00:07:41,709 --> 00:07:43,059
I'm sorry that...

92
00:07:44,645 --> 00:07:46,595
I couldn't make it by sooner.

93
00:07:46,833 --> 00:07:47,833
It's okay.

94
00:07:48,523 --> 00:07:49,823
You're here now.

95
00:07:54,646 --> 00:07:56,827
Why did you come, Miles?

96
00:07:59,271 --> 00:08:00,821
I need you to tell me

97
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:03,614
why I'm this way...

98
00:08:08,006 --> 00:08:10,141
How I do the things I do.

99
00:08:13,645 --> 00:08:15,134
And I need to know why

100
00:08:15,259 --> 00:08:17,287
you won't talk to me
about my father.

101
00:08:18,398 --> 00:08:20,374
Because he never cared about us...

102
00:08:22,503 --> 00:08:24,103
Never cared about you.

103
00:08:24,708 --> 00:08:26,130
I need to know where he is.

104
00:08:26,583 --> 00:08:29,007
- It doesn't matter where.
- It does matter.

105
00:08:30,093 --> 00:08:31,760
- I have a right to know!
- He's dead.

106
00:08:36,976 --> 00:08:38,176
Your father...

107
00:08:39,976 --> 00:08:42,729
Kicked us out
when you were just a baby.

108
00:08:45,101 --> 00:08:47,317
He didn't want anything
to do with us.

109
00:08:48,601 --> 00:08:51,196
So the less you knew about him,

110
00:08:51,802 --> 00:08:52,727
the better.

111
00:08:57,537 --> 00:08:59,165
Why didn't you just tell me?

112
00:08:59,290 --> 00:09:00,790
Because it was over.

113
00:09:02,626 --> 00:09:04,876
Your dad has been dead

114
00:09:05,225 --> 00:09:06,795
a long time.

115
00:09:12,476 --> 00:09:13,826
Where's his body?

116
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:19,850
Somewhere you can never go.

117
00:09:26,976 --> 00:09:30,027
Pierre, if it was caused
by the electromagnetism, we must know.

118
00:09:30,788 --> 00:09:32,154
You wanna see it now?

119
00:09:32,412 --> 00:09:33,488
He just got back.

120
00:09:34,101 --> 00:09:35,866
I'll send him out with it
right away.

121
00:09:39,601 --> 00:09:40,996
Did you bring the package?

122
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:42,915
"Package"?
You mean the corpse?

123
00:09:43,084 --> 00:09:46,543
Yeah. Now I need you to bring it out
to Dr. Chang at the Orchid.

124
00:09:51,175 --> 00:09:53,199
Listen, man. I'm security.

125
00:09:53,663 --> 00:09:56,845
If you need somebody to drive the van,
can't someone from the motor pool do it?

126
00:09:57,014 --> 00:10:00,037
If I wanted someone from the motor pool,
I would have asked them.

127
00:10:00,162 --> 00:10:03,393
And since Lafleur decided to disappear,
you're all I've got.

128
00:10:03,978 --> 00:10:07,481
So just bring it out to Dr. Chang,
and we'll all call it a day.

129
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:21,960
What the hell are you doing?!
That's my van!

130
00:10:22,085 --> 00:10:23,372
Nah, I just signed it out.

131
00:10:23,541 --> 00:10:24,915
Doesn't matter. It's mine.

132
00:10:25,084 --> 00:10:27,116
- Well, where you going?
- The Orchid.

133
00:10:27,241 --> 00:10:29,962
Me too. I made lunch
for the crew. Sandwiches.

134
00:10:30,243 --> 00:10:32,965
Want one? Ham and cheese,
and I made my secret garlic mayo.

135
00:10:34,717 --> 00:10:36,051
You'll wait for the next van.

136
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:38,345
We're going to the same place.
Why don't we carpool?

137
00:10:38,514 --> 00:10:40,722
It'll help with global warming,
which hasn't happened yet,

138
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:42,474
so maybe we can prevent it.

139
00:10:43,857 --> 00:10:46,478
Wait a sec.
Are you on some kind of secret mission?

140
00:10:46,994 --> 00:10:48,094
Just get in.

141
00:11:00,306 --> 00:11:01,406
How'd it go?

142
00:11:01,743 --> 00:11:03,930
We gave him to the Others.

143
00:11:04,055 --> 00:11:06,373
- Anyone see you?
- I don't think so.

144
00:11:06,992 --> 00:11:08,242
Did James help?

145
00:11:08,556 --> 00:11:10,711
Yes. Thank you so much
for sending him.

146
00:11:11,431 --> 00:11:12,431
Of course.

147
00:11:15,129 --> 00:11:17,129
I got here as soon as I could.

148
00:11:17,993 --> 00:11:20,543
All the vans were out,
so I had to ru...

149
00:11:23,933 --> 00:11:24,808
Where's Ben?

150
00:11:28,129 --> 00:11:29,129
Did he...

151
00:11:31,006 --> 00:11:33,367
- Then where is he?
- Roger, I'm so sorry.

152
00:11:33,492 --> 00:11:35,777
I was gone for ten minutes.
I don't know.

153
00:11:35,992 --> 00:11:38,613
What? You said he was dying.
How could he be gone?

154
00:11:38,782 --> 00:11:41,950
What is she telling me,
that he just got up and walked out?

155
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:43,869
You're supposed to watch him!

156
00:11:44,447 --> 00:11:47,122
- I know. Roger, if we just calm down-
- Don't tell me to calm down!

157
00:11:47,803 --> 00:11:49,541
Somebody came and took my boy?!

158
00:11:49,710 --> 00:11:51,001
I know. I am so sorry.

159
00:11:51,243 --> 00:11:52,843
I'm going to security.

160
00:12:00,431 --> 00:12:01,431
Well...

161
00:12:03,681 --> 00:12:04,681
Here we go.

162
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:21,887
How do you spell "bounty hunter"?

163
00:12:22,012 --> 00:12:24,562
What are you doing,
writing your memoirs?

164
00:12:24,764 --> 00:12:25,964
It's personal.

165
00:12:35,574 --> 00:12:36,574
Dude...

166
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,167
Did you just... You know?

167
00:12:40,387 --> 00:12:41,387
What?

168
00:12:41,513 --> 00:12:42,513
You know.

169
00:12:43,532 --> 00:12:44,679
It stinks. Did you...

170
00:12:46,449 --> 00:12:47,899
Well, it wasn't me.

171
00:12:48,888 --> 00:12:50,638
So roll down your window.

172
00:12:53,823 --> 00:12:55,732
Nah, man,
there's something foul in here.

173
00:12:56,182 --> 00:12:58,985
- It's coming from back there.
- Maybe it's your famous garlic mayo.

174
00:12:59,154 --> 00:13:00,654
That's not possible.

175
00:13:02,389 --> 00:13:04,699
Okay, maybe it is possible.
Pull over. I gotta check.

176
00:13:04,867 --> 00:13:06,451
Forget it.
You're imagining things.

177
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:09,496
I gotta check. If those sandwiches
are bad, people could get sick.

178
00:13:11,374 --> 00:13:12,874
Will you pull over?!

179
00:13:36,131 --> 00:13:39,151
There's a body bag back here.
There's a body in it.

180
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:41,445
That's traditionally
what you put in a body bag.

181
00:13:41,614 --> 00:13:42,904
Who is he? What happened?

182
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:47,600
Don't worry about it
and don't tell anybody you saw him.

183
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:49,760
Dude, what happened to him?

184
00:13:50,978 --> 00:13:52,372
His name's Alvarez.

185
00:13:52,541 --> 00:13:56,341
He was digging a hole and thinking
about some chick named Andr?a.

186
00:13:57,392 --> 00:14:00,042
Then he felt this sharp pain
in his mouth,

187
00:14:00,167 --> 00:14:02,370
which turned out to be
a filling from his tooth

188
00:14:02,495 --> 00:14:04,885
being yanked right out
of its socket and...

189
00:14:05,456 --> 00:14:06,970
Blowing through his brain.

190
00:14:08,144 --> 00:14:09,494
Then he was dead.

191
00:14:10,408 --> 00:14:12,642
How does a filling get blown
through someone's head?

192
00:14:13,579 --> 00:14:15,179
Got me. Can we go now?

193
00:14:16,516 --> 00:14:18,266
How do you know all this?

194
00:14:18,455 --> 00:14:19,455
Because...

195
00:14:19,817 --> 00:14:22,277
- I know.
- How do you know what he was thinking?

196
00:14:22,954 --> 00:14:24,054
I just know.

197
00:14:25,016 --> 00:14:26,916
You can talk to dead people.

198
00:14:28,831 --> 00:14:30,431
Can we please just go?

199
00:14:32,578 --> 00:14:35,415
Don't worry, dude.
Your secret's safe with me.

200
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:36,708
You wanna know why?

201
00:14:37,828 --> 00:14:39,794
- No.
- 'cause I can talk to 'em, too.

202
00:14:50,766 --> 00:14:54,566
If you don't mind, Mr. Gray,
can you tell me what happened to him?

203
00:14:56,452 --> 00:14:57,813
Last labor day weekend,

204
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:01,170
drunk driver ran the light.

205
00:15:03,414 --> 00:15:04,528
That was that.

206
00:15:05,292 --> 00:15:07,042
Where is your son buried?

207
00:15:07,641 --> 00:15:11,641
We cremated him, scattered the ashes
on the football field at school.

208
00:15:13,996 --> 00:15:16,582
For what I do,
it's much better if there's a body.

209
00:15:18,392 --> 00:15:22,171
But your ad said you could communicate
with the dead anytime, anywhere.

210
00:15:22,766 --> 00:15:25,049
- I know what my ad says, but...
- Please.

211
00:15:28,866 --> 00:15:30,816
I just want you to ask him...

212
00:15:33,586 --> 00:15:35,059
Did he know that I loved him?

213
00:15:38,204 --> 00:15:39,802
It's gonna cost extra.

214
00:15:41,737 --> 00:15:42,737
Of course.

215
00:15:48,517 --> 00:15:49,460
Thank you.

216
00:15:58,035 --> 00:15:59,177
Okay, now...

217
00:16:00,841 --> 00:16:02,513
Please give me your hands.

218
00:16:06,097 --> 00:16:09,489
I want you to concentrate on Russell.
Just get a picture of him in your head.

219
00:16:09,656 --> 00:16:10,878
Can you do that?

220
00:16:11,808 --> 00:16:12,953
Yeah. Okay.

221
00:16:29,925 --> 00:16:31,025
Did it work?

222
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:35,370
Your son says
he knew that you loved him.

223
00:16:36,684 --> 00:16:37,934
He always knew.

224
00:16:41,075 --> 00:16:42,075
Thank you.

225
00:16:42,767 --> 00:16:44,467
I'm sorry for your loss.

226
00:16:53,390 --> 00:16:54,390
Excuse me.

227
00:16:55,517 --> 00:16:56,682
Miles Straume?

228
00:16:57,140 --> 00:16:59,977
- Yeah.
- Hi. My name's Naomi Dorrit.

229
00:17:01,311 --> 00:17:03,751
My employer's been following
your work for some time now,

230
00:17:03,918 --> 00:17:06,859
and he's interested in retaining
your rather unique services.

231
00:17:08,485 --> 00:17:10,410
There's a restaurant
not too far from here.

232
00:17:10,577 --> 00:17:12,663
Would you like to hear
what I have to say?

233
00:17:12,923 --> 00:17:14,444
Yeah. Absolutely.

234
00:17:53,827 --> 00:17:54,698
Hi, Roger.

235
00:17:58,328 --> 00:17:59,279
You okay?

236
00:18:01,203 --> 00:18:02,353
Let me see...

237
00:18:02,667 --> 00:18:04,310
Well, my son got shot

238
00:18:04,958 --> 00:18:07,008
and now he's disappeared, so...

239
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:10,214
I think I'm pretty far from okay.

240
00:18:12,285 --> 00:18:13,835
You know, I'm sure...

241
00:18:15,067 --> 00:18:16,867
Things are gonna work out.

242
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:21,743
Well,

243
00:18:22,259 --> 00:18:23,959
thanks for the pep talk.

244
00:18:25,587 --> 00:18:27,648
I just have a feeling
he's gonna be okay.

245
00:18:31,853 --> 00:18:33,654
What do you mean, a feeling?

246
00:18:34,175 --> 00:18:36,824
I just don't think
that you should give up hope.

247
00:18:43,879 --> 00:18:45,479
Do you know something?

248
00:18:47,358 --> 00:18:49,922
- Do you know what happened to my son?
- No, I don't.

249
00:18:50,786 --> 00:18:53,632
Wait a minute.
Why are you so interested in my kid?

250
00:18:54,064 --> 00:18:56,343
I'm sorry I came over here,
I was just trying to help.

251
00:18:56,593 --> 00:18:57,970
You're trying to help, huh?

252
00:18:58,473 --> 00:19:00,023
You wanna help, Kate?

253
00:19:01,062 --> 00:19:03,767
Well, why don't you just mind
your own business?

254
00:19:23,052 --> 00:19:24,913
I don't know
why you just won't admit it.

255
00:19:25,175 --> 00:19:27,124
You can trust me.
I talk to lots of dead people.

256
00:19:27,489 --> 00:19:30,947
So you have conversations with them,
like they're your pals?

257
00:19:31,219 --> 00:19:32,634
Sure, all the time.

258
00:19:32,801 --> 00:19:34,751
Sometimes we even play chess.

259
00:19:35,176 --> 00:19:36,633
You actually see them?

260
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:40,596
- Of course. Why wouldn't I?
- Because that's not how it works.

261
00:19:41,247 --> 00:19:43,432
You wouldn't know ow it works
unless you can do it.

262
00:19:44,181 --> 00:19:47,514
What I can do has nothing to do
with chatting with ghosts, you nitwit.

263
00:19:47,681 --> 00:19:49,000
It's a feeling,

264
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:51,864
a sense.
When somebody's dead,

265
00:19:52,031 --> 00:19:54,891
their brain stops functioning,
which means there's no more talking.

266
00:19:55,058 --> 00:19:57,780
There's just who they were
and whatever they knew before they died.

267
00:19:59,119 --> 00:20:00,892
That's how it works for me.

268
00:20:01,059 --> 00:20:02,618
Great. I'm happy for you.

269
00:20:02,870 --> 00:20:05,970
You're just jealous
my powers are better than yours.

270
00:20:06,433 --> 00:20:07,496
We're here.

271
00:20:07,863 --> 00:20:11,063
Now shut the hell up
and deliver your damn sandwiches.

272
00:20:33,871 --> 00:20:35,421
What's he doing here?

273
00:20:36,193 --> 00:20:38,737
He came to deliver lunch
to the work crew.

274
00:20:39,119 --> 00:20:41,448
Lunch?
Your instructions were to come alone.

275
00:20:42,565 --> 00:20:45,244
Don't worry.
I won't tell anyone about the body.

276
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:49,456
He knows?

277
00:20:49,706 --> 00:20:52,626
I'm sorry, sir. He was rooting around
in the back, and he saw it.

278
00:20:53,058 --> 00:20:53,877
Dude.

279
00:20:54,305 --> 00:20:57,222
- I can keep a secret.
- Well, you'd better...

280
00:20:57,432 --> 00:21:00,425
Hurley, 'cause if you think
working in the kitchen is bad

281
00:21:00,675 --> 00:21:02,125
I like the kitchen.

282
00:21:03,322 --> 00:21:05,818
Well, how do you feel
about polar bear feces?

283
00:21:05,985 --> 00:21:09,203
Because if you breathe one word of this,
I'll have you shipped to Hydra island

284
00:21:09,370 --> 00:21:12,604
so you can weigh turds
for their ridiculous experiments.

285
00:21:13,382 --> 00:21:14,295
Gross.

286
00:21:17,012 --> 00:21:17,912
You two!

287
00:21:18,175 --> 00:21:19,825
Get the package inside.

288
00:21:22,046 --> 00:21:22,865
And you?

289
00:21:24,192 --> 00:21:26,702
Stay here till I get back.
You think you can handle that?

290
00:21:27,054 --> 00:21:28,040
Yes, sir.

291
00:21:41,050 --> 00:21:42,826
Dude, that guy's a total douche.

292
00:21:42,993 --> 00:21:44,693
You are not qualified...

293
00:21:45,002 --> 00:21:46,471
That douche is my dad.

294
00:21:54,435 --> 00:21:56,460
You did say
you were taking me out to dinner.

295
00:21:56,627 --> 00:21:59,327
No, I said
I was taking you to a restaurant.

296
00:22:01,749 --> 00:22:03,885
You wanna tell me what's back here,
sweetheart?

297
00:22:04,052 --> 00:22:05,096
Your audition.

298
00:22:09,744 --> 00:22:11,881
Look,
whatever you got going on here,

299
00:22:12,848 --> 00:22:14,459
this isn't really my thing.

300
00:22:14,626 --> 00:22:17,794
From what I understand, if the price
is right, this is exactly your thing.

301
00:22:20,251 --> 00:22:22,601
So what can you tell me
about this man?

302
00:22:47,216 --> 00:22:48,566
His name's Felix.

303
00:22:51,632 --> 00:22:52,582
He was...

304
00:22:53,862 --> 00:22:56,412
On his way
to deliver something to, uh...

305
00:22:59,461 --> 00:23:00,963
A guy named... Widmore.

306
00:23:02,405 --> 00:23:03,478
Deliver what?

307
00:23:07,392 --> 00:23:10,806
A bunch of papers,
photos, pictures...

308
00:23:12,841 --> 00:23:13,684
of...

309
00:23:14,512 --> 00:23:16,362
Empty graves.

310
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:18,610
A purchase order...

311
00:23:19,655 --> 00:23:21,155
For an old airplane.

312
00:23:31,328 --> 00:23:32,333
So...

313
00:23:33,091 --> 00:23:34,037
Did I pass?

314
00:23:37,279 --> 00:23:39,548
I'm leading an expedition
to an island,

315
00:23:39,715 --> 00:23:42,299
and on the island is a man
that will be very difficult to find.

316
00:23:42,466 --> 00:23:44,066
That's why I need you.

317
00:23:44,871 --> 00:23:45,922
Need me for what?

318
00:23:46,089 --> 00:23:49,853
This island has a number
of deceased individuals, residing on it,

319
00:23:50,717 --> 00:23:53,098
and as this man is the one
responsible for their being deceased,

320
00:23:53,507 --> 00:23:56,476
we believe they can supply invaluable
information as to his whereabouts.

321
00:23:59,109 --> 00:24:03,098
As much as hunting down
a mass murderer sounds really safe,

322
00:24:03,860 --> 00:24:06,160
uh, I'm... I'm gonna pass.

323
00:24:06,594 --> 00:24:08,237
Thanks for the audition.

324
00:24:09,473 --> 00:24:12,325
My employer is willing
to pay you $1.6 million.

325
00:24:16,034 --> 00:24:17,164
When do we leave?

326
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:30,366
- So anyway...
- I don't want to talk about it.

327
00:24:30,533 --> 00:24:31,866
Are you kidding me?

328
00:24:32,033 --> 00:24:35,168
How weird is it that your dad is
that dude from all those movies?

329
00:24:35,335 --> 00:24:36,855
Only, he was called Marvin Kandle.

330
00:24:37,022 --> 00:24:38,268
Was that a stage name?

331
00:24:38,522 --> 00:24:41,043
What part of "I don't want to talk
about it" isn't sinking in?

332
00:24:41,270 --> 00:24:44,058
Well, if you didn't want
to talk about it, why'd you tell me?

333
00:24:45,065 --> 00:24:47,224
How long have you known
he was your dad?

334
00:24:47,391 --> 00:24:49,667
The third day we were here,
I was on line at the cafeteria,

335
00:24:49,834 --> 00:24:52,013
and my mother got in line behind me.

336
00:24:52,866 --> 00:24:54,476
That was my first clue.

337
00:24:55,769 --> 00:24:58,902
But all those Dharma dudes end up dead.
Don't you wanna...

338
00:24:59,541 --> 00:25:01,479
- Save him?
- I can't save him.

339
00:25:01,731 --> 00:25:05,131
They're gonna get kill
no matter what I do, so why bother?

340
00:25:07,022 --> 00:25:10,258
I need you to take me to
Radzinsky at the work site immediately.

341
00:25:11,736 --> 00:25:14,471
You... Hurley, you say a word...

342
00:25:14,818 --> 00:25:16,348
Polar bear poop. Got it.

343
00:25:19,394 --> 00:25:21,994
- What happened to the body?
- What body?

344
00:25:34,817 --> 00:25:36,827
This room is on my rounds.
What are you doing here?

345
00:25:37,241 --> 00:25:39,091
I figured I'd cover for ya.

346
00:25:39,798 --> 00:25:41,481
I heard what happened to your son.

347
00:25:41,648 --> 00:25:42,748
Which part?

348
00:25:43,437 --> 00:25:44,787
That he got shot

349
00:25:45,557 --> 00:25:47,671
or that someone
kidnapped him from the infirmary?

350
00:25:48,707 --> 00:25:51,716
- Then what are you doing here at work?
- What else am I gonna do?

351
00:25:51,966 --> 00:25:55,757
Sit around and pray that
those idiots are gonna find my boy?

352
00:25:59,841 --> 00:26:01,184
So you can get outta here.

353
00:26:15,378 --> 00:26:18,785
You came in here a couple days ago
with that woman Kate, right?

354
00:26:21,129 --> 00:26:22,831
- Yeah.
- You know her at all?

355
00:26:24,692 --> 00:26:25,692
Why?

356
00:26:26,026 --> 00:26:27,702
'cause she's got some...

357
00:26:28,091 --> 00:26:29,952
kinda weird thing for my kid.

358
00:26:31,067 --> 00:26:34,367
First, she shows up
at the infirmary and gave him blood.

359
00:26:35,822 --> 00:26:39,372
But then when he goes missing,
she comes to me and she says,

360
00:26:39,663 --> 00:26:40,960
"Don't worry.

361
00:26:41,127 --> 00:26:42,627
He's gonna be okay."

362
00:26:44,941 --> 00:26:47,141
I'm gonna tell you somethin', man.

363
00:26:48,004 --> 00:26:50,734
I'm beginning to think that
she's got something to do with this.

364
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:55,405
I should go to Horace,

365
00:26:57,649 --> 00:26:58,575
report her.

366
00:27:01,692 --> 00:27:03,092
What do you think?

367
00:27:05,311 --> 00:27:07,111
I think, Roger, that, uh,

368
00:27:07,650 --> 00:27:10,398
that you've had a hell of a day,
and that's...

369
00:27:10,565 --> 00:27:13,632
Given you a very good excuse
to go out and get drunk.

370
00:27:14,316 --> 00:27:17,616
Maybe that's put some...
some crazy ideas into your head.

371
00:27:19,942 --> 00:27:21,389
I know that woman... Kate.

372
00:27:22,881 --> 00:27:26,731
She's my friend, and she would never
do anything to hurt your son.

373
00:27:27,752 --> 00:27:28,752
Sure.

374
00:27:53,190 --> 00:27:56,337
So I'm new here, Dr. Chang.
What is it exactly you do at the Orchid?

375
00:27:56,504 --> 00:27:57,550
It's classified.

376
00:27:58,565 --> 00:28:01,150
Oh, really? You can't tell anyone?
Not even your wife?

377
00:28:01,317 --> 00:28:02,317
No.

378
00:28:03,064 --> 00:28:04,618
What about your kids?

379
00:28:05,506 --> 00:28:08,712
I have a 3-months son,
so, no, I haven't told him.

380
00:28:09,103 --> 00:28:10,583
3 months? Wow! Congrats.

381
00:28:11,378 --> 00:28:13,441
- What's his name?
- Miles.

382
00:28:14,941 --> 00:28:16,041
Small world.

383
00:28:17,254 --> 00:28:19,765
That's your name, too. Right, Miles?

384
00:28:20,252 --> 00:28:21,252
Yeah.

385
00:28:22,942 --> 00:28:26,522
So are you a fan of jazz, Dr. Chang?
Like Miles Davis?

386
00:28:26,791 --> 00:28:27,841
My wife is.

387
00:28:28,626 --> 00:28:29,865
I like country.

388
00:28:31,965 --> 00:28:35,964
So you two have been here for three
years now. Must be pretty tight, huh?

389
00:28:39,926 --> 00:28:43,386
Dr. Chang and I... don't exactly
travel in the same circles.

390
00:28:44,815 --> 00:28:47,015
I wasn't aware there were circles.

391
00:28:47,452 --> 00:28:49,102
Great. We should all...

392
00:28:49,536 --> 00:28:52,522
get together for a beer sometime.
How awesome would that be?

393
00:28:56,677 --> 00:28:57,677
Stop here.

394
00:29:29,177 --> 00:29:32,479
You don't need to wait.
I'll get a ride back with Radzinsky.

395
00:29:34,238 --> 00:29:37,364
Dude, what is this place?
And what's up with all the secrecy?

396
00:29:37,615 --> 00:29:38,777
Don't know. Don't care.

397
00:29:44,431 --> 00:29:45,282
Hey, Glenn!

398
00:29:46,364 --> 00:29:48,787
What's the serial number
that goes on the hatch lid?

399
00:29:50,927 --> 00:29:51,790
4, 8...

400
00:29:56,882 --> 00:29:57,742
15...

401
00:30:01,174 --> 00:30:02,116
16...

402
00:30:05,345 --> 00:30:06,302
23...

403
00:30:09,054 --> 00:30:11,434
- Hold on a minute. It's smudged.
- 42.

404
00:30:12,082 --> 00:30:12,917
42.

405
00:30:14,107 --> 00:30:16,990
- How the hell did you know that?
- 'cause

406
00:30:17,675 --> 00:30:19,150
they're building our hatch.

407
00:30:19,717 --> 00:30:20,767
What hatch?

408
00:30:23,244 --> 00:30:25,292
The one that crashed our plane.

409
00:30:41,122 --> 00:30:42,172
Hey, Miles.

410
00:30:43,242 --> 00:30:44,442
Do I know you?

411
00:30:54,912 --> 00:30:56,162
My name's Bram.

412
00:30:57,059 --> 00:30:58,312
You owe me a fish taco.

413
00:30:58,437 --> 00:31:01,312
Sorry about that,
but your apartment's being watched,

414
00:31:01,437 --> 00:31:05,137
and we had to try our best to talk you
out of working for Charles Widmore.

415
00:31:05,471 --> 00:31:07,321
I have no idea who that is.

416
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:12,678
He's the man who chartered the boat
you'll be getting on next week.

417
00:31:12,803 --> 00:31:15,853
And, my friend,
you do not wanna get on that boat.

418
00:31:17,793 --> 00:31:20,519
Do you know what lies
in the shadow of the statue?

419
00:31:21,190 --> 00:31:23,256
No, can't say that I do.

420
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:25,769
Then you're not ready
to go to that island.

421
00:31:26,382 --> 00:31:27,811
But if you come with us,

422
00:31:27,936 --> 00:31:31,067
all those things you've spent your life
trying to find out?

423
00:31:31,342 --> 00:31:32,445
You'll know.

424
00:31:33,299 --> 00:31:35,399
You'll know who you are, Miles,

425
00:31:36,268 --> 00:31:37,853
why it is you have a gift,

426
00:31:38,711 --> 00:31:41,611
and most of all,
you'll know about your father.

427
00:31:46,354 --> 00:31:48,622
I don't know where you've been getting
your intel,

428
00:31:48,747 --> 00:31:51,742
but I stopped caring about my father
a long time ago.

429
00:31:52,825 --> 00:31:54,825
What I do care about is money.

430
00:31:55,684 --> 00:31:57,284
So I'll tell you what.

431
00:31:58,046 --> 00:32:00,187
You want me to pass
on going to the island?

432
00:32:00,312 --> 00:32:03,712
It's gonna cost you double
what they offered: 3.2 million.

433
00:32:04,451 --> 00:32:06,089
We're not paying you anything.

434
00:32:07,676 --> 00:32:09,503
But all the money in the world

435
00:32:09,628 --> 00:32:12,378
isn't gonna fill
that empty hole inside you.

436
00:32:16,296 --> 00:32:18,050
That's sad, isn't it?

437
00:32:19,039 --> 00:32:20,039
Toss him!

438
00:32:26,362 --> 00:32:29,931
- You're playing for the wrong team.
- Yeah? What team are you on?

439
00:32:30,056 --> 00:32:31,806
The one that's gonna win.

440
00:32:44,270 --> 00:32:47,053
That hatch they're building?
There's gonna be an accident.

441
00:32:47,178 --> 00:32:49,798
They'll have to build a computer
with a button you have to push

442
00:32:49,923 --> 00:32:51,385
so the world doesn't end.

443
00:32:54,429 --> 00:32:55,629
So your dad...

444
00:32:56,018 --> 00:32:57,268
Is he around...

445
00:32:58,690 --> 00:33:01,240
You know, when we came from?
The future?

446
00:33:03,516 --> 00:33:06,567
- Then  this is awesome for you, huh?
- How is it awesome?

447
00:33:06,736 --> 00:33:10,740
Because you get to hang out with him,
get to know him better and stuff.

448
00:33:11,005 --> 00:33:14,658
And don't thank me, but he was
totally down for that beer, dude.

449
00:33:14,888 --> 00:33:19,071
And maybe he'll let you hold baby you,
or you can change your own diaper or...

450
00:33:21,476 --> 00:33:25,127
Listen up, 'cause we're only gonna have
this conversation once.

451
00:33:25,493 --> 00:33:27,351
I don't wanna hang out with my dad.

452
00:33:27,476 --> 00:33:30,049
I don't wanna know him better
and "stuff."

453
00:33:30,625 --> 00:33:33,469
Why not? Did he beat you up
when you were little?

454
00:33:33,637 --> 00:33:36,737
He wasn't even around
when I was little, you dimwit!

455
00:33:36,867 --> 00:33:38,717
I never knew him until now.

456
00:33:39,925 --> 00:33:41,352
Why am I telling you this?

457
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:43,312
You're in pain,
you need to let it out.

458
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:44,780
I'm not in pain!

459
00:33:45,233 --> 00:33:48,680
It doesn't matter.
My father is dead. He's gone.

460
00:33:48,805 --> 00:33:52,239
He never cared about me,
and nothing I can do

461
00:33:52,364 --> 00:33:54,657
- will ever change that.
- But he's not gone.

462
00:33:55,818 --> 00:33:57,123
We just dropped him off.

463
00:33:58,855 --> 00:34:00,430
You wanna get into my business?

464
00:34:00,555 --> 00:34:02,613
- Let's get into yours!
- Give it back to me.

465
00:34:02,738 --> 00:34:04,721
- Let's read your diary!
- It's personal!

466
00:34:04,846 --> 00:34:08,003
What's going on in that piece
of granite you call a head?

467
00:34:08,903 --> 00:34:11,316
- Give it back!
- "Exterior: Hoth.

468
00:34:11,842 --> 00:34:15,243
"A little spy robot thingy
zips through the atmosphere

469
00:34:15,368 --> 00:34:17,968
"and crashes
into the snowy planet below.

470
00:34:18,515 --> 00:34:20,178
"That's when Chewbacca shows up

471
00:34:20,303 --> 00:34:22,960
"and blasts it away
with his crossbow laser.

472
00:34:23,085 --> 00:34:25,985
"He shakes his fury fist
in the sky in triumph.

473
00:34:26,472 --> 00:34:28,920
"Chewbacca: - Raaar..."

474
00:34:29,623 --> 00:34:30,773
It's "furry."

475
00:34:31,653 --> 00:34:32,803
"Furry fist."

476
00:34:33,319 --> 00:34:35,698
- I need to spell-check it.
- What the hell is this?

477
00:34:41,339 --> 00:34:43,439
I'm writing <i>Empire Strikes Back</i>.

478
00:34:44,405 --> 00:34:46,834
- I'm sorry. What?
- It's 1977, right?

479
00:34:48,176 --> 00:34:49,991
So <i>Stars Wars</i> just came out.

480
00:34:50,116 --> 00:34:53,239
And pretty soon, George Lucas
is gonna be looking for a sequel.

481
00:34:53,364 --> 00:34:55,876
I've seen <i>Empire</i> like, 200 times,
so I figured

482
00:34:56,001 --> 00:34:58,178
I'd make life easier
and send him the script.

483
00:35:00,181 --> 00:35:01,765
With a couple improvements.

484
00:35:02,348 --> 00:35:04,893
That has gotta be
the stupidest thing I've ever heard.

485
00:35:05,061 --> 00:35:05,853
Yeah?

486
00:35:06,897 --> 00:35:09,540
Well, at least I'm not scared
to talk to my own dad.

487
00:35:20,512 --> 00:35:22,619
- James. You're back.
- Barely.

488
00:35:22,787 --> 00:35:26,540
You ever felt like the little Dutch boy
with your finger in the...

489
00:35:32,629 --> 00:35:33,929
What's going on?

490
00:35:34,389 --> 00:35:36,003
Ben's father thinks that Kate

491
00:35:36,128 --> 00:35:38,408
had something to do
with his son going missing.

492
00:35:39,068 --> 00:35:41,218
Why the hell would he think that?

493
00:35:41,365 --> 00:35:44,182
Because she talked to him,
tried to make him feel better.

494
00:35:46,425 --> 00:35:49,229
- Her heart was in the right place.
- Yeah, well, where was her head?

495
00:35:50,932 --> 00:35:54,026
I had a talk with Roger.
He won't say anything to anyone for now.

496
00:35:56,614 --> 00:35:58,156
I just wanted you to know.

497
00:36:03,627 --> 00:36:06,078
Yeah? Well...
Thanks for filling me in, doc.

498
00:36:06,557 --> 00:36:07,498
No problem.

499
00:36:19,264 --> 00:36:20,173
Hey, boss.

500
00:36:20,971 --> 00:36:23,263
We got a development.
You better come to the office.

501
00:36:23,844 --> 00:36:25,869
I've been running around
the jungle all day,

502
00:36:25,994 --> 00:36:28,100
so whatever developments you got
can wait.

503
00:36:28,270 --> 00:36:29,970
I know who took the kid.

504
00:36:32,745 --> 00:36:33,816
Yeah? Who's that?

505
00:36:39,042 --> 00:36:39,988
You.

506
00:36:41,539 --> 00:36:44,451
Got a perfectly good explanation
for what you saw on that tape.

507
00:36:44,619 --> 00:36:45,953
I sure as hell hope so.

508
00:36:50,956 --> 00:36:52,647
- You talk to Horace yet?
- No.

509
00:36:52,772 --> 00:36:55,045
I thought that after 3 years
of working together,

510
00:36:55,214 --> 00:36:57,050
I'd give you
the benefit of the doubt...

511
00:36:59,548 --> 00:37:00,748
Get some rope.

512
00:37:11,445 --> 00:37:12,445
Mr. Gray?

513
00:37:13,155 --> 00:37:15,172
I hope you don't mind.
Your gate was open.

514
00:37:15,297 --> 00:37:17,109
Mr. Straume.
Of course. No problem.

515
00:37:18,886 --> 00:37:20,636
What, what brings you by?

516
00:37:21,579 --> 00:37:22,679
Well, sir...

517
00:37:24,131 --> 00:37:27,131
I'm about to go on a boat trip
for a while,

518
00:37:28,069 --> 00:37:28,871
and...

519
00:37:30,937 --> 00:37:33,137
I wanted to give this back to you.

520
00:37:39,793 --> 00:37:40,993
I lied to you,

521
00:37:41,788 --> 00:37:42,788
Mr. Gray.

522
00:37:43,892 --> 00:37:46,054
I wasn't able to talk to your son.

523
00:37:50,678 --> 00:37:52,519
Why are you telling me this?

524
00:37:53,011 --> 00:37:56,054
You could have just let me
go on believing what you said.

525
00:37:56,609 --> 00:37:58,482
That wouldn't have been fair
to your son.

526
00:37:59,138 --> 00:38:00,027
I'm sorry?

527
00:38:04,353 --> 00:38:07,013
If you needed your son
to know that you loved him,

528
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:09,870
you should've told him
when he was still alive.

529
00:38:39,985 --> 00:38:42,861
Sorry I said you were afraid
to talk toour dad, dude.

530
00:38:43,029 --> 00:38:44,613
Don't worry about it.

531
00:38:46,165 --> 00:38:47,573
I used to hate my dad, too.

532
00:38:47,742 --> 00:38:50,118
- Yeah?
- He left when I was 10.

533
00:38:53,605 --> 00:38:55,402
But the best thing I ever did

534
00:38:55,683 --> 00:38:57,167
was give him a second chance.

535
00:38:58,175 --> 00:39:02,182
We got to be the best of friends,
and although I may never see him again,

536
00:39:03,273 --> 00:39:04,323
I miss him.

537
00:39:05,086 --> 00:39:06,551
And I know he feels the same.

538
00:39:07,544 --> 00:39:10,494
My dad didn't leave when I was 10.
I was a baby.

539
00:39:11,818 --> 00:39:13,168
I never knew him.

540
00:39:14,562 --> 00:39:16,062
And I don't want to.

541
00:39:16,926 --> 00:39:18,376
It's not happening.

542
00:39:19,144 --> 00:39:21,144
That was Luke's attitude, too.

543
00:39:22,546 --> 00:39:24,357
- What?
- In <i>Empire</i>,

544
00:39:25,527 --> 00:39:27,431
Luke found out Wader was his father,

545
00:39:27,556 --> 00:39:30,981
but instead of putting away
his lightsaber and talking about it,

546
00:39:31,106 --> 00:39:33,202
he overreacted
and got his hand cut off.

547
00:39:34,832 --> 00:39:38,041
I mean, they worked it out eventually,
but at what cost?

548
00:39:38,649 --> 00:39:42,101
Another Death Star was destroyed,
Boba Fett got eaten by the Sarlacc,

549
00:39:42,226 --> 00:39:43,776
and we got the Ewoks.

550
00:39:45,178 --> 00:39:47,365
It all could've been avoided
if they'd just,

551
00:39:47,490 --> 00:39:49,200
you know, communicated.

552
00:39:50,503 --> 00:39:53,153
And let's face it.
The Ewoks sucked, dude.

553
00:40:54,442 --> 00:40:56,196
Miles? I need you.

554
00:40:58,390 --> 00:40:59,372
You do?

555
00:40:59,845 --> 00:41:02,209
Sub's here from H.Q.
I need your help bringing them in.

556
00:41:02,957 --> 00:41:06,207
- Sure. New recruits?
- No, scientists from Ann Arbor.

557
00:41:06,902 --> 00:41:09,152
Get your van
and let's get to the dock.

558
00:41:23,316 --> 00:41:26,016
- Can I get a hand with this?
- Yeah, sure.

559
00:41:37,661 --> 00:41:38,711
Hey, Miles.

560
00:41:41,490 --> 00:41:42,840
Long time no see.
