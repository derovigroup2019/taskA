1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,740
Previously on Lost...

2
00:00:01,750 --> 00:00:03,980
The Dharma folks at the Swan work site...

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,840
They're gonna drill into the ground and
accidentally tap into a massive pocket of energy.

4
00:00:07,870 --> 00:00:13,440
And that will cause your plane...
Oceanic 815... to crash on this island.

5
00:00:13,460 --> 00:00:16,880
And just how exactly do you
plan on destroying this energy?

6
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:19,590
I'm gonna detonate a hydrogen bomb.

7
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:53,660
- Morning.
- Mornin'.

8
00:01:54,570 --> 00:01:57,750
- Mind if I join you?
- Please.

9
00:02:01,870 --> 00:02:04,060
Want some fish?

10
00:02:04,930 --> 00:02:07,930
Thank you. I just ate.

11
00:02:08,650 --> 00:02:10,750
I take it you're here 'cause of the ship.

12
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:13,280
I am.

13
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:18,040
How did they find the island?

14
00:02:18,070 --> 00:02:20,440
You'll have to ask 'em when they get here.

15
00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:24,920
I don't have to ask.

16
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:28,320
You brought them here.

17
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:30,660
Still trying to prove me wrong, aren't you?

18
00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:33,640
- You are wrong.
- Am I?

19
00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:39,850
They come. They fight. They destroy. They corrupt.

20
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:42,230
It always ends the same.

21
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:43,930
It only ends once.

22
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:48,230
Anything that happens before that is just progress.

23
00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:02,200
Do you have any idea how badly I wanna kill you?

24
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:04,860
Yes.

25
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:07,250
One of these days, sooner or later...

26
00:03:08,270 --> 00:03:11,090
I'm going to find a loophole, my friend.

27
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:14,370
When you do, I'll be right here.

28
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:20,170
Always nice talking to you, Jacob.

29
00:03:21,450 --> 00:03:23,470
Nice talking to you, too.

41
00:04:13,190 --> 00:04:15,260
Are you gonna do it?

42
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:18,720
- You do it.
- Fine. I'll do it.

43
00:04:18,730 --> 00:04:20,450
But you're gonna be lookout, okay?

44
00:04:21,110 --> 00:04:23,270
Okay.

45
00:04:28,650 --> 00:04:31,220
The crops came in pretty good this year.

46
00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:34,320
Hey you hear? Frank bought the old...

47
00:04:34,330 --> 00:04:37,850
Yeah, I hear he's gonna farm the
land all the way out to Ames road.

48
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:39,420
Yeah, I hear that, too.

49
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:49,930
There's nothing he would like less.

50
00:04:54,770 --> 00:04:58,600
What you kids got there? Open your bag.

51
00:05:04,630 --> 00:05:06,990
- Where'd you get this?
- Got it over there.

52
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,440
I know you. You're Diane Austen's girl.

53
00:05:10,450 --> 00:05:12,170
- What's your name?
- Katie.

54
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:14,470
Well, Katie, I'm calling your mom, then the cops,

55
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:17,390
because I don't tolerate stealing here. You understand?

56
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,810
No need to do that. I'll pay for it.

57
00:05:24,690 --> 00:05:27,100
I hope this is enough.

58
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:32,290
Well, long as somebody pays for
it, guess there's no harm done.

59
00:05:33,930 --> 00:05:38,190
But I don't wanna see you in here ever again
without your parents. You understand me?

60
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:45,010
- Thanks, mister.
- You're welcome.

61
00:05:47,490 --> 00:05:50,110
You're not gonna steal anymore, are you?

62
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:58,060
Be good, Katie.

63
00:06:01,630 --> 00:06:03,460
<i>Welcome aboard, everyone.</i>

64
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:05,510
<i>We will be doing some system checks offshore here</i>

65
00:06:05,550 --> 00:06:09,990
<i>before heading out into the open ocean and</i>
<i>submerging to our operational running depth.</i>

66
00:06:11,130 --> 00:06:15,300
<i>You should be receiving your sedatives, and</i>
<i>then we will escort you to your sleeping berths.</i>

67
00:06:15,310 --> 00:06:18,720
Have a nice rest. See you on the other side.

68
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:24,230
We have to get out of here.

69
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:27,210
"Out of here"? We're underwater.

70
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,920
What the hell are you doing here?
How'd you get caught?

71
00:06:29,930 --> 00:06:31,540
I came back to get you.

72
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:34,220
- Came back to get me for what?
- Where's Jack?

73
00:06:34,230 --> 00:06:38,000
Jack is on his way to blow up a hydrogen bomb.

74
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:40,630
- Why the hell would he do that?
- Does it matter?

75
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:42,790
We have to stop him.

76
00:06:48,910 --> 00:06:51,160
Sorry, I'm gonna pass.

77
00:06:51,170 --> 00:06:53,590
- Did you hear what I just said?
- Yeah, I heard you.

78
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:55,330
You just don't get it, Kate.

79
00:06:55,370 --> 00:06:58,240
We were happy in Dharmaville till y'all showed up.

80
00:06:58,950 --> 00:07:01,620
But now that's all over.

81
00:07:02,170 --> 00:07:06,600
So we're gonna drink our O.J. and
take our chances in the real world.

82
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:10,400
Jack wants to blow up the island?

83
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:14,160
Good for Jack.

84
00:07:16,650 --> 00:07:20,340
Is there anything in there about how we're
supposed to move a 10-ton bomb across the island?

85
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:22,240
Actually, it's 20 tons.

86
00:07:23,230 --> 00:07:27,250
Fortunately, it seems that Faraday never
intended to freight the device in its entirety.

87
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:29,040
What?

88
00:07:29,050 --> 00:07:33,490
He left detailed instructions on
how to remove the plutonium core...

89
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:37,810
And how to detonate it.

90
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:42,100
Faraday told me that we need to wipe
out some kind of pocket of energy.

91
00:07:42,130 --> 00:07:44,030
Is only part of the bomb
gonna be enough to do that?

92
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:46,480
The core itself is a
thermonuclear weapon.

93
00:07:46,510 --> 00:07:48,110
It'll be more than enough.

94
00:07:52,570 --> 00:07:54,420
Wait.

95
00:07:54,430 --> 00:07:56,370
We sealed that thing up 20 years ago,

96
00:07:56,410 --> 00:07:59,330
and we put it underground
because it was emitting radiation.

97
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:01,300
Does this sound like a good idea to you, Eloise?

98
00:08:01,310 --> 00:08:02,550
- Richard...
- You're pregnant.

99
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:05,390
Which is exactly why we have
to help them see this through.

100
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:10,920
Once the core is removed, then what?

101
00:08:10,930 --> 00:08:14,350
Then we have approximately two
hours to take it to the Swan site.

102
00:08:14,710 --> 00:08:17,010
Two hours?

103
00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:21,740
When Faraday returned to the island,
he was very explicit about his timetable.

104
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:26,410
Well then... we'd better get movin'.

105
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:41,740
Who stopped the damn drill?

106
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:43,930
I did.

107
00:08:44,430 --> 00:08:45,390
Why?

108
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:48,530
Because when we passed 70 meters,
the drill temp went up 60 degrees,

109
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:50,250
and I didn't want it to melt.

110
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:52,870
Pierre, that's why we have a truck full of water.

111
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:55,050
So cool it down and turn it on.

112
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:58,550
Stuart, we've just evacuated the
island of all nonessential personnel.

113
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:00,580
We're in the midst of a possible insurrection.

114
00:09:00,590 --> 00:09:04,140
Do you really think this is the
ideal time for your experiments?

115
00:09:04,150 --> 00:09:06,570
I've been working on this
project for six years...

116
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:10,440
designing a station that'll be able to manipulate
electromagnetism in ways we only dreamed of.

117
00:09:10,450 --> 00:09:14,090
Have you thought about the consequences
of drilling into that pocket?

118
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:15,810
We have no idea what we are going to...

119
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:17,670
If Edison was only worried about the consequences,

120
00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:20,370
we'd all still be sitting in the dark.

121
00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:22,150
I came to this island to change the world, Pierre.

122
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:24,860
That's exactly what I intend to to.

123
00:09:25,650 --> 00:09:28,490
Let's get it started!

124
00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:07,070
Take five, everybody. We still got
a ways to go to get to Jacob's.

125
00:10:08,370 --> 00:10:10,170
Who's Jacob?

126
00:10:10,190 --> 00:10:12,650
He's in charge of this island.

127
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:16,040
- You said John was in charge.
- No, I said he was the leader...

128
00:10:16,340 --> 00:10:20,080
A title that I've discovered
is incredibly temporary.

129
00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:24,650
But everyone answers to someone,
and the leader answers to Jacob.

130
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:27,490
What's he like?

131
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:31,370
I don't know, Sun. I've never met him.

132
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:44,780
You've been staring for the
last ten minutes, Richard.

133
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:48,280
Is there something you would like to ask me?

134
00:10:48,910 --> 00:10:52,140
Ben told me that... he strangled you.

135
00:10:52,590 --> 00:10:55,340
That is my recollection, yes.

136
00:10:56,190 --> 00:10:57,420
He said he was sure you were dead.

137
00:10:57,430 --> 00:11:01,090
He saw your coffin loaded onto
that plane that you came back on.

138
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:02,860
How are you alive?

139
00:11:02,890 --> 00:11:05,780
Well, you've been on this island
much longer than I have, Richard.

140
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:09,410
If anyone should have an explanation,
I'd think it would be you.

141
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:12,840
Yeah, I-I have been here a long time, John,

142
00:11:12,850 --> 00:11:16,860
and I've seen things on this island
that I can barely describe. But...

143
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:20,150
I've never seen someone come back to life.

144
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:23,280
And I've never seen anyone who doesn't age.

145
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:24,900
It doesn't mean it can't happen.

146
00:11:24,910 --> 00:11:27,690
I'm this way because of Jacob.

147
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:31,630
And if I had to guess, he's the reason
you're not in that coffin anymore.

148
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:36,380
I agree completely, Richard. That's
why I'm doing this... so I can thank him.

149
00:11:38,810 --> 00:11:42,870
And once I've done that, we're gonna need
to deal with the rest of the passengers

150
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:45,470
from the Ajira flight that brought me here.

151
00:11:46,190 --> 00:11:49,910
- What do you mean, "deal with"?
- You know what I mean.

152
00:11:51,950 --> 00:11:54,160
Let's go!

153
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:21,750
Untie the crates.

154
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,580
Why'd we even bring this yahoo?

155
00:12:25,610 --> 00:12:28,600
- Because we might need him.
- For what?

156
00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:31,480
He didn't know the answer to the question.

157
00:12:31,490 --> 00:12:33,680
That doesn't mean he's not important.

158
00:12:33,690 --> 00:12:35,960
What, you think he's a candidate?

159
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:43,970
He's awake.

160
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:47,210
How long you been listening to us?

161
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:50,160
Long enough to wonder what
the hell I'm a candidate for.

162
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:57,250
Who the hell are you people?

163
00:12:57,270 --> 00:12:58,700
We're friends.

164
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:02,620
So you smack all your friends in the face with
a rifle, shove 'em in a boat and kidnap 'em?

165
00:13:02,630 --> 00:13:05,170
Only the ones we like.

166
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:12,700
Let's go.

167
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:19,440
What's in the box?

168
00:13:24,110 --> 00:13:26,280
Your call.

169
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:32,230
Open it.

170
00:13:48,650 --> 00:13:49,830
Terrific.

171
00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:41,440
Need a pen, son?

172
00:14:44,710 --> 00:14:47,230
Yeah. Thanks.

173
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:53,990
There you go. You can keep it.

174
00:14:58,300 --> 00:15:01,860
I'm very sorry about your mother and father, James.

175
00:15:15,230 --> 00:15:18,720
Come on, Jimmy. We gotta get to the cemetery, okay?

176
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:23,630
- What you writin'?
- Nothin'.

177
00:15:28,610 --> 00:15:30,820
"Dear Mr. Sawyer,"

178
00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:36,730
"You don't know who I am, but I know
who you are, and I know what you done."

179
00:15:43,810 --> 00:15:46,260
Listen to me, Jimmy.

180
00:15:46,270 --> 00:15:50,080
I know you're angry at the man
that did this to your mama and daddy.

181
00:15:50,090 --> 00:15:53,890
And hell, you got every right to be.

182
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:56,360
But you gotta move on, boy.

183
00:15:56,370 --> 00:16:00,810
They're gone, and there ain't
nothin' you can do to change that.

184
00:16:03,070 --> 00:16:06,900
What's done is done.

185
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:13,030
Now promise me you're not gonna finish that letter.

186
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:17,600
I promise.

187
00:16:18,150 --> 00:16:20,540
Good.

188
00:16:21,770 --> 00:16:25,450
Come on. Let's go say good-bye.

189
00:16:37,450 --> 00:16:38,990
Let me get this straight.

190
00:16:39,010 --> 00:16:42,760
Jack sets off a nuke, which
somehow resets everything.

191
00:16:42,770 --> 00:16:45,900
So Flight 815 never crashes. It just...

192
00:16:45,910 --> 00:16:49,340
lands in L.A. safe and sound,
and none of this never happens.

193
00:16:49,350 --> 00:16:51,990
Sawyer, if Jack does this,
he could kill everyone on the island.

194
00:16:52,020 --> 00:16:55,470
- Yeah, I heard that part.
- And you're okay with that?

195
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:57,950
You ain't hearing me, Kate.

196
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:01,200
I made a choice, and I'm sticking to it.

197
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:03,750
I decided to leave, and I'm leavin'.

198
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:06,710
All right, here's your sedatives.

199
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:13,240
What the hell did you just do?

200
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:17,040
We decided to leave this island, James. We did.

201
00:17:17,050 --> 00:17:19,170
And now we're going back.

202
00:17:19,860 --> 00:17:23,120
- You serious?
- We can't just let those people die.

203
00:17:25,630 --> 00:17:30,490
You want out? You wanna
stay here and whine about it?

204
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:35,850
Unlock the damn cuffs.

205
00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:38,140
"Galaga" to base. The system check is complete.

206
00:17:38,150 --> 00:17:40,860
We're locked on departure bearing
and ready to leave the island.

207
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:45,260
<i>Roger that, "Galaga". Have a</i>
<i>safe trip. See you on the return.</i>

208
00:17:49,490 --> 00:17:51,940
Give me your gun.

209
00:17:53,730 --> 00:17:55,510
Appreciate that, captain.

210
00:17:55,550 --> 00:17:57,220
Now we need you to surface the sub.

211
00:17:57,230 --> 00:17:59,490
What? I can't take this sub...

212
00:18:00,270 --> 00:18:03,510
- Oh, I think you can.
- Once we're gone, proceed on course.

213
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:07,350
Whatever you do, do not take those
people back to the island. Understand?

214
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:11,880
And what if Horace tries to contact me?
What am I supposed to say?

215
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:16,300
You ain't home.

216
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:19,430
Go.

217
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:35,550
Sayid... is this big enough?

218
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:37,990
That'll do.

219
00:18:40,780 --> 00:18:43,210
- Are you done with Faraday's journal?
- Take it.

220
00:19:10,530 --> 00:19:13,780
- Can I ask you a question?
- Sure.

221
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:19,160
Over, uh, 20 years ago, a man named John Locke...

222
00:19:20,710 --> 00:19:25,010
He walked right into our camp, and he
told me that he was gonna be our leader.

223
00:19:26,070 --> 00:19:30,710
Now I've gone off the island three
times since then to visit him.

224
00:19:31,610 --> 00:19:35,380
But he never seemed, uh,
particularly special to me.

225
00:19:35,390 --> 00:19:37,760
You said you had a question.

226
00:19:37,770 --> 00:19:40,340
You know him? Locke?

227
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:46,500
Yeah. Yeah, I know him.

228
00:19:48,230 --> 00:19:52,580
And if I were you, I wouldn't give up on him.

229
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:09,210
Why haven't you told him yet?

230
00:20:09,220 --> 00:20:12,130
- Told who what?
- Richard.

231
00:20:12,490 --> 00:20:15,580
Why haven't you told him about my plans for Jacob?

232
00:20:15,590 --> 00:20:21,520
If by "plans" you mean murdering him, John,
I assume you'd want to keep that a secret.

233
00:20:22,650 --> 00:20:25,580
When did that ever stop you?

234
00:20:25,590 --> 00:20:30,120
Well, I started thinking differently about things
when my dead daughter threatened to destroy me

235
00:20:30,130 --> 00:20:32,890
if I didn't do everything you said.

236
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:35,790
W-wait. Wait.

237
00:20:36,260 --> 00:20:37,710
Where did this happen?

238
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:42,640
In that cavern beneath the temple,
when we went to see the monster.

239
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:49,960
So... you're willing to do
whatever I say no matter what it is?

240
00:20:52,490 --> 00:20:54,990
Yes.

241
00:20:55,940 --> 00:21:00,850
Well then... I guess I won't
have to convince you after all.

242
00:21:03,380 --> 00:21:06,270
Convince me to do what?

243
00:21:07,310 --> 00:21:10,130
I'm not gonna kill Jacob, Ben.

244
00:21:11,510 --> 00:21:14,190
You are.

245
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:29,530
- Paris or Rome?
- No.

246
00:21:29,540 --> 00:21:30,990
- Florence?
- It doesn't matter, Sayid...

247
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,620
- Yes, it does.
- As long as we're together.

248
00:21:32,630 --> 00:21:34,810
It's our anniversary.
We have to find the perfect place.

249
00:21:34,820 --> 00:21:37,690
I would settle for finding my sunglasses.

250
00:21:41,740 --> 00:21:44,070
Excuse me, sir? Could you you help me?

251
00:21:44,510 --> 00:21:47,080
I'm sorry. I think I'm lost.
Are you from Los Angeles?

252
00:21:47,090 --> 00:21:50,330
- What are you looking for?
- I found them.

253
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:56,750
Nadia?

254
00:22:03,620 --> 00:22:07,390
Nadia? Nadia?

255
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,540
Time is short. Let's go.

256
00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:26,340
Mm, stand back.

257
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:45,880
It's one of the Dharma houses.

258
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:47,830
I'll go first.

259
00:23:47,850 --> 00:23:51,850
Jack, don't misunderstand who's
in charge here. I'll go first.

260
00:23:51,860 --> 00:23:56,130
Because if someone at that house is a
threat, you might hesitate... but I won't.

261
00:23:56,140 --> 00:23:59,370
All right. Okay, Eloise, go on. After you.

262
00:23:59,750 --> 00:24:04,020
Once we give you the "all clear",
then you bring the bomb.

263
00:24:05,570 --> 00:24:07,500
We don't want any acci... Oh!

264
00:24:07,510 --> 00:24:09,650
What the hell are you doing?

265
00:24:09,860 --> 00:24:12,710
I'm protecting our leader. Get back.

266
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:18,350
She's gonna be angry when she wakes up,
but that's a lot better than being dead.

267
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:22,140
She ordered me to help you.
We helped you. Now you're on your own.

268
00:24:22,390 --> 00:24:25,500
And I'm taking her out the way we came in.

269
00:24:26,730 --> 00:24:29,590
After you.

270
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:57,670
<i>All residents, we are in a code black.</i>

271
00:24:57,680 --> 00:25:01,750
<i>Report with your weapons to your</i>
<i>security assignments immediately.</i>

272
00:25:04,220 --> 00:25:09,120
<i>If you come into contact with a hostile,</i>
<i>you are authorized to use deadly force.</i>

273
00:25:09,130 --> 00:25:11,740
How the hell are we gonna get out of here?

274
00:25:17,820 --> 00:25:20,580
We hide in plain sight.

275
00:25:27,530 --> 00:25:29,640
Set up a perimeter around the barracks first.

276
00:25:29,650 --> 00:25:32,930
You go over there by the gate. You get two...

277
00:25:38,140 --> 00:25:40,180
So you guys go. You go to pylons.

278
00:25:40,190 --> 00:25:42,690
We're gathering over there.

279
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:02,180
You're the son of a bitch who shot my kid.

280
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:04,760
Don't fire that weapon!

281
00:26:04,770 --> 00:26:07,680
I'm carrying a nuclear device.

282
00:26:07,690 --> 00:26:10,030
It's the hostile!

283
00:26:49,270 --> 00:26:51,440
Get in!

284
00:26:53,250 --> 00:26:55,380
Drive!

285
00:27:12,370 --> 00:27:15,750
From the looks of the sun, I'd say
that's the north shore over there.

286
00:27:15,780 --> 00:27:18,200
Sun's over there. That's gotta be the west coast.

287
00:27:18,820 --> 00:27:21,180
Really? What, you got a compass?

288
00:27:21,190 --> 00:27:23,820
No. Do you?

289
00:27:45,170 --> 00:27:47,970
- Thank you.
- For what?

290
00:27:47,980 --> 00:27:50,440
For backing me up at the sub.

291
00:27:50,830 --> 00:27:53,100
No problem.

292
00:27:54,530 --> 00:27:57,490
I got no idea where the hell we are.

293
00:28:00,310 --> 00:28:02,710
Vincent! Come here!

294
00:28:03,670 --> 00:28:05,770
How you doing, boy?

295
00:28:05,780 --> 00:28:09,260
I haven't seen you since the
flaming arrows three years ago.

296
00:28:09,530 --> 00:28:11,670
- How you doing?
- How did he survive alone out here?

297
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:14,370
Oh, hell, no.

298
00:28:18,050 --> 00:28:20,810
Bernard!

299
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:31,430
They found us.

300
00:28:33,220 --> 00:28:36,030
Son of a bitch.

301
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:42,490
Is that a bomb?

302
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:44,750
Try not to move. I need to stop the bleeding.

303
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:46,270
What's going on back there? Is Sayid okay?

304
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:49,400
Does he look okay?
Just keep your eyes on the damn road!

305
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:51,570
Should I pull over?

306
00:28:51,580 --> 00:28:53,690
Yeah, let's pull over and get shot! Just drive!

307
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:56,460
- I don't know where we're going.
- The Swan site. Head to the Swan.

308
00:28:56,470 --> 00:28:58,050
Why do you want to go there?
If Sayid's shot, shouldn't we...

309
00:28:58,060 --> 00:29:01,640
Hurley, if you want to save
Sayid, take us to the Swan.

310
00:29:01,650 --> 00:29:03,630
- The Swan it is.
- Jack, what's at the Swan?

311
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:06,490
I think I found a way to
get you back to your wife.

312
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:13,430
So hold on.

313
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:17,960
You're telling me you've just been living out here
in the jungle for the past three years, by yourselves?

314
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:21,130
I'm sorry y'all got left behind.

315
00:29:21,150 --> 00:29:23,380
Didn't you hear me shout out, "meet at the creek"?

316
00:29:23,410 --> 00:29:27,450
You mean with flaming arrows raining down
around us, killing everyone we knew?

317
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:28,760
Oh, sure, we heard ya.

318
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:31,080
We spent all sorts of time looking for ya.

319
00:29:31,110 --> 00:29:34,680
I had Jin out searching the island grid by grid.

320
00:29:34,710 --> 00:29:36,860
Yeah, we know.

321
00:29:36,870 --> 00:29:38,080
You know?

322
00:29:38,110 --> 00:29:41,470
Oh, sure, you guys all joined
up with the Dharma Initiative.

323
00:29:41,510 --> 00:29:43,110
Well, damn, I could've brought both y'all in.

324
00:29:43,130 --> 00:29:45,540
Why didn't you find a way
to tell us you were out here?

325
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:48,370
Because we're retired.

326
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:57,420
So y'all been scavenging food and
living out in a hut by yourselves.

327
00:29:57,470 --> 00:29:59,650
People try their whole lives
to get themselves a nice,

328
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:02,760
quiet place near the ocean
where they can live in peace.

329
00:30:02,900 --> 00:30:04,330
And we did it.

330
00:30:04,590 --> 00:30:06,660
That's what we made for ourselves.

331
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:09,810
Well, I hate to rain on your parade, but...

332
00:30:10,110 --> 00:30:12,430
Your condo's about to go kablooie.

333
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:13,900
Jack has a bomb.

334
00:30:13,970 --> 00:30:15,380
Who cares?

335
00:30:15,470 --> 00:30:16,890
Excuse me?

336
00:30:16,990 --> 00:30:19,220
It's always something with you people.

337
00:30:19,380 --> 00:30:22,080
Now you say Jack's got a bomb.

338
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:25,040
And what, you guys are all
gonna try to stop him, right?

339
00:30:25,110 --> 00:30:26,530
Yeah, that's right.

340
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:31,960
We traveled back 30 years in time, and you're
still trying to find ways to shoot each other?

341
00:30:33,150 --> 00:30:37,440
Rose, we just need to know which way
the Dharma barracks are from here

342
00:30:37,530 --> 00:30:41,880
so we can stop Jack, or you're gonna be dead.

343
00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:43,650
We all will.

344
00:30:43,690 --> 00:30:45,580
So we die.

345
00:30:45,700 --> 00:30:47,940
We just care about being together.

346
00:30:52,990 --> 00:30:55,070
That's all that matters in the end.

347
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:05,250
The barracks are 5 miles that way.

348
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:11,080
- Bernard.
- Sawyer.

349
00:31:11,150 --> 00:31:12,540
Rose.

350
00:31:13,450 --> 00:31:14,570
Thank you.

351
00:31:14,630 --> 00:31:16,930
- Let's go.
- Bye.

352
00:31:16,990 --> 00:31:19,250
You sure don't want some tea?

353
00:31:23,450 --> 00:31:25,380
Maybe another time.

354
00:31:39,140 --> 00:31:41,930
I wish you'd never showed
me what was in this damn box.

355
00:31:41,980 --> 00:31:43,750
What the hell you gonna do with it anyway?

356
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:45,740
We need to show it to somebody.

357
00:31:45,860 --> 00:31:47,400
What for?

358
00:31:47,470 --> 00:31:49,530
So they'll know who they're up against.

359
00:31:49,650 --> 00:31:51,260
What exactly are they up against?

360
00:31:51,340 --> 00:31:54,530
Something a hell of a lot scarier
than what's in this box, Frank.

361
00:31:55,220 --> 00:31:56,560
Don't worry, though.

362
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:59,190
As long as you're with us, you're fine.

363
00:32:00,190 --> 00:32:03,240
That would be reassuring if I
knew who you were, "friend".

364
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:05,880
We are the good guys.

365
00:32:06,530 --> 00:32:10,930
In my experience, the people who go out of their way
to tell you that they're the good guys are the bad guys.

366
00:32:15,180 --> 00:32:17,180
We're here.

367
00:32:29,780 --> 00:32:31,720
Look at the ash!

368
00:32:37,490 --> 00:32:39,370
Wait here.

369
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:46,360
I'm here because I need your help.

370
00:33:52,790 --> 00:33:54,720
Can you do that?

371
00:33:58,740 --> 00:34:01,000
Will you help me, Ilana?

372
00:34:02,780 --> 00:34:04,690
Yes.

373
00:34:57,820 --> 00:34:58,600
What happened?

374
00:34:58,730 --> 00:35:02,010
He isn't there, hasn't been in a long time.

375
00:35:02,350 --> 00:35:05,040
Someone else has been using it.

376
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:10,000
Burn it!

377
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:18,490
I'm no tree hugger or anything, but that's a pretty
good way to torch the whole jungle, don't you think?

378
00:35:21,540 --> 00:35:23,580
So what now?

379
00:35:31,190 --> 00:35:33,680
I guess we know where we're going.

380
00:36:22,970 --> 00:36:24,770
Oh, my God!

381
00:36:33,830 --> 00:36:34,950
Oh, my God!

382
00:36:35,110 --> 00:36:37,240
Call 911!

383
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:40,400
Is he all right?

384
00:36:40,530 --> 00:36:42,420
I don't know!

385
00:36:50,210 --> 00:36:52,260
Don't worry. Everything's gonna be all right.

386
00:36:56,940 --> 00:36:59,700
I'm sorry this happened to you.

387
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:26,730
This is our old camp.

388
00:37:27,470 --> 00:37:29,450
Home sweet home.

389
00:37:30,890 --> 00:37:34,540
All right, everyone, Richard tells me we
should get to where we're going by nightfall.

390
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:38,220
So why don't you all take this opportunity
to rest up and catch your breath?

391
00:37:38,530 --> 00:37:42,310
Considering what I have planned
for ya, you're gonna need it.

392
00:37:55,180 --> 00:37:56,700
Everything all right?

393
00:37:56,820 --> 00:37:59,920
I was enjoying some alone time.

394
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:04,860
You see what's behind you?

395
00:38:08,390 --> 00:38:09,570
It's a door.

396
00:38:09,590 --> 00:38:11,250
- How about that?
- It's not just a door, Ben.

397
00:38:11,340 --> 00:38:14,880
It's the door to the hatch
where you and I first met.

398
00:38:18,740 --> 00:38:22,070
- You mind if I ask you a question?
- I'm a Pisces.

399
00:38:23,290 --> 00:38:28,080
What happened that day at the cabin,
when you first took me to meet Jacob?

400
00:38:31,790 --> 00:38:35,710
You clearly already know that I was
talking to an empty chair, John...

401
00:38:39,020 --> 00:38:42,000
That I was pretending.

402
00:38:42,140 --> 00:38:45,050
Which is not to say that I
wasn't as surprised as you were

403
00:38:45,110 --> 00:38:47,950
when things started flying around in the room.

404
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:51,930
But why would you go to all the
trouble to make something like that up?

405
00:38:55,340 --> 00:38:57,550
I was embarrassed.

406
00:38:58,110 --> 00:39:02,270
I didn't want you to know
that I had never seen Jacob.

407
00:39:05,130 --> 00:39:07,880
So, yes, I lied.

408
00:39:09,610 --> 00:39:12,390
That's what I do.

409
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:20,240
All right, then.

410
00:39:21,130 --> 00:39:24,680
Why do you want me to kill Jacob, John?

411
00:39:27,770 --> 00:39:29,050
Because...

412
00:39:29,170 --> 00:39:34,100
Despite your loyal service to
this island, you got cancer...

413
00:39:35,350 --> 00:39:39,850
You had to watch your own daughter
gunned down right in front of you.

414
00:39:40,210 --> 00:39:43,270
And your reward for those sacrifices?

415
00:39:43,350 --> 00:39:45,640
You were banished.

416
00:39:46,070 --> 00:39:50,930
And you did all this in the name
of a man you'd never even met.

417
00:39:53,190 --> 00:39:59,260
So the question is, Ben, why the
hell wouldn't you wanna kill Jacob?

418
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:14,730
How much further?

419
00:43:14,730 --> 00:43:17,430
Uh, we're about five minutes away.

420
00:43:17,940 --> 00:43:20,250
You can't stop the bleeding.

421
00:43:20,990 --> 00:43:22,290
I need fresh dressings.

422
00:43:22,380 --> 00:43:25,290
Jack, so this bomb is supposed
to what, blow us back in time?

423
00:43:25,430 --> 00:43:26,950
We're not going back in time.

424
00:43:27,460 --> 00:43:29,880
Right, because that would be ridiculous.

425
00:43:29,930 --> 00:43:31,760
I need to modify the bomb.

426
00:43:31,860 --> 00:43:34,560
I can rig it so it detonates on impact.

427
00:43:34,690 --> 00:43:38,100
Jack, we need to be there at
the moment of the incident.

428
00:43:38,130 --> 00:43:41,130
Or all of this will be for nothing.

429
00:43:43,210 --> 00:43:45,030
Why the hell are we stopping?

430
00:43:45,070 --> 00:43:47,020
That's why.

431
00:44:10,950 --> 00:44:12,900
What is it?

432
00:44:13,050 --> 00:44:14,980
Why are we stopping?

433
00:44:15,390 --> 00:44:17,610
You'll see.

434
00:44:37,690 --> 00:44:41,650
Well, it's a wonderful foot, Richard,
but what does it have to do with Jacob?

435
00:44:42,590 --> 00:44:45,110
It's where he lives.

436
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:03,870
- What's going on, Kate?
- Doc, we gotta talk.

437
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:09,040
You wanna talk? Then get in the van.

438
00:45:09,050 --> 00:45:11,610
- We don't have time...
- I ain't gettin' in the van.

439
00:45:12,040 --> 00:45:13,580
I need five minutes, that's all.

440
00:45:13,670 --> 00:45:16,530
I'll say what I gotta say, and then you
can do whatever the hell you want to.

441
00:45:17,890 --> 00:45:20,610
But you're gonna listen.
You owe me that much, Jack.

442
00:45:24,470 --> 00:45:26,740
Five minutes.

443
00:45:57,880 --> 00:46:00,400
Dr. Shephard? You're all right?

444
00:46:00,990 --> 00:46:03,330
The dural sac... I cut it.

445
00:46:04,810 --> 00:46:07,160
- Give me some suction.
- Calm down. It's alright.

446
00:46:07,160 --> 00:46:08,680
The fluid's leaking everywhere. I can't...

447
00:46:08,770 --> 00:46:10,050
- Look at me.
- Give me some suction.

448
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:12,300
- Yes, doctor.
- Jack...

449
00:46:12,460 --> 00:46:14,880
Look at me.

450
00:46:15,580 --> 00:46:17,820
Count to five.

451
00:46:17,960 --> 00:46:18,960
What are you talking about?

452
00:46:19,080 --> 00:46:24,020
I'm talking about you stitching up the sac so
this girl isn't paralyzed for the rest of her life.

453
00:46:24,320 --> 00:46:28,210
And the only way you're gonna
do that is not to be afraid.

454
00:46:28,390 --> 00:46:34,230
So close your eyes, count to
five, and then fix her, Jack.

455
00:46:37,410 --> 00:46:40,300
Or I'll have to fix her for you.

456
00:46:48,850 --> 00:46:50,510
One...

457
00:46:50,610 --> 00:46:51,960
Two...

458
00:46:52,100 --> 00:46:53,960
Three...

459
00:46:53,960 --> 00:46:55,750
Four...

460
00:46:57,340 --> 00:46:59,840
Five.

461
00:47:02,010 --> 00:47:04,580
Sutures.

462
00:47:23,590 --> 00:47:25,530
Hey, kiddo.

463
00:47:25,660 --> 00:47:27,010
Girl's in recovery.

464
00:47:27,120 --> 00:47:30,270
She's responsive to stimulus below the waist, so...

465
00:47:30,360 --> 00:47:32,960
No paralysis.

466
00:47:33,130 --> 00:47:35,310
Good.

467
00:47:35,710 --> 00:47:38,870
Something wrong, Jack?

468
00:47:38,950 --> 00:47:41,310
You embarrassed me.

469
00:47:41,980 --> 00:47:43,950
Did I?

470
00:47:44,110 --> 00:47:48,680
You know, it's bad enough that everybody in this
hospital thinks the only reason I got this residency

471
00:47:48,710 --> 00:47:50,480
is because you're my father.

472
00:47:50,610 --> 00:47:52,230
But then you...

473
00:47:52,290 --> 00:47:57,760
You put me in a time-out during my first
major procedure, in front of my entire team.

474
00:47:58,610 --> 00:48:04,400
Dad, I know you don't believe
in me, but I need them to.

475
00:48:04,990 --> 00:48:09,910
Are you sure I'm the one who
doesn't believe in you, Jack?

476
00:48:17,820 --> 00:48:20,060
One of these yours?

477
00:48:23,710 --> 00:48:25,560
Machine got stuck.

478
00:48:25,710 --> 00:48:28,080
I guess it just needed a little push.

479
00:48:46,160 --> 00:48:48,280
Take a load off, doc.

480
00:48:48,300 --> 00:48:50,470
No, thanks.

481
00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:53,160
Sit down, Jack.

482
00:49:01,260 --> 00:49:04,660
My folks died when I was 8 years old.
I ever tell you that?

483
00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:07,360
No.

484
00:49:07,610 --> 00:49:10,360
Con man took my dad for everything he had.

485
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:12,910
He didn't handle it too well, so...

486
00:49:14,080 --> 00:49:18,150
He shot my mom, then he blew his own head off.

487
00:49:19,020 --> 00:49:21,330
I was hiding under the bed when it happened.

488
00:49:21,400 --> 00:49:23,920
I heard the whole thing.

489
00:49:25,290 --> 00:49:26,940
I'm sorry.

490
00:49:27,030 --> 00:49:29,290
Yeah.

491
00:49:29,870 --> 00:49:32,780
That was a year ago.

492
00:49:32,980 --> 00:49:34,220
What?

493
00:49:34,310 --> 00:49:40,430
Right now it's July 1977, which
means that happened last year.

494
00:49:41,050 --> 00:49:45,470
So I could've hopped on the
sub, gone back to the States,

495
00:49:45,540 --> 00:49:51,310
walked right in my house and stopped
my daddy from killing anybody.

496
00:49:51,600 --> 00:49:53,770
Why didn't you?

497
00:49:53,950 --> 00:49:56,280
Because, Jack...

498
00:49:57,550 --> 00:50:00,490
What's done is done.

499
00:50:03,560 --> 00:50:06,520
It doesn't have to be that way.

500
00:50:07,430 --> 00:50:12,780
What did you screw up so bad the first time around you're
willing to blow up a damn nuke just for a second chance?

501
00:50:12,850 --> 00:50:15,960
- That's not what this is about.
- Then what is it about?

502
00:50:20,070 --> 00:50:27,860
Three years ago, Locke told me that all this was
happening for a reason, that us being here was our destiny.

503
00:50:27,990 --> 00:50:30,780
I don't speak "destiny".

504
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:36,460
What I do understand is a man does what he
does 'cause he wants something for himself.

505
00:50:41,800 --> 00:50:44,500
What do you want, Jack?

506
00:50:52,300 --> 00:50:54,740
I had her.

507
00:50:55,950 --> 00:50:59,220
I had her, and I lost her.

508
00:51:00,950 --> 00:51:03,320
Kate?

509
00:51:03,930 --> 00:51:06,830
Well, damn, doc, she's standing right
on the other side of those trees.

510
00:51:06,920 --> 00:51:09,340
You want her back, just go and ask her.

511
00:51:09,340 --> 00:51:12,410
Nah, it's too late for that.

512
00:51:18,550 --> 00:51:21,110
Your five minutes is up.

513
00:51:21,790 --> 00:51:23,170
Jack...

514
00:51:23,240 --> 00:51:29,070
If what you're doin' even works, you and Kate
will be strangers, and she'll be in damn handcuffs.

515
00:51:29,180 --> 00:51:32,490
If it's meant to be, it's meant to be.

516
00:51:35,550 --> 00:51:38,740
Well, I guess there's nothing I can
say that's gonna change your mind.

517
00:51:38,830 --> 00:51:40,470
No, I guess there's not.

518
00:51:42,150 --> 00:51:44,200
Who the hell do you think you are?

519
00:51:57,240 --> 00:52:00,140
You think you can come here and
do whatever the hell you want?

520
00:52:00,470 --> 00:52:02,420
I had a life here!

521
00:52:09,220 --> 00:52:12,750
Sawyer, listen...
You don't get it.

522
00:52:24,500 --> 00:52:26,250
Will you stop?

523
00:52:26,370 --> 00:52:28,080
Will you stop?

524
00:52:28,230 --> 00:52:30,100
No.

525
00:52:34,040 --> 00:52:36,060
James!

526
00:52:36,840 --> 00:52:38,430
Let him go.

527
00:52:38,500 --> 00:52:39,850
He wouldn't listen.

528
00:52:39,940 --> 00:52:41,350
I had to. He won't stop!

529
00:52:41,450 --> 00:52:44,380
That's because he's right.

530
00:52:44,570 --> 00:52:46,220
What?

531
00:52:46,340 --> 00:52:49,680
He's right, James. We have to do this.

532
00:52:49,840 --> 00:52:51,820
What are you talking about?

533
00:52:51,930 --> 00:52:55,060
You're the one that told me
to come back here and stop him!

534
00:52:55,200 --> 00:52:57,630
What happened?

535
00:52:58,640 --> 00:53:00,880
I changed my mind.

536
00:53:11,500 --> 00:53:13,150
Girls...

537
00:53:13,150 --> 00:53:16,520
Your dad and I have something we
need to talk to you both about.

538
00:53:16,580 --> 00:53:18,410
Are we moving again?

539
00:53:18,600 --> 00:53:20,440
No, stupid. They're getting a divorce.

540
00:53:20,540 --> 00:53:23,400
- Rachel...
- Well, aren't you?

541
00:53:25,310 --> 00:53:26,260
- Yes.
- But...

542
00:53:26,360 --> 00:53:31,010
We need you both to understand
that your father and I...

543
00:53:31,180 --> 00:53:33,480
We still love each other.

544
00:53:33,560 --> 00:53:37,920
Just because two people love each other, doesn't
always mean they're supposed to be together.

545
00:53:38,010 --> 00:53:40,810
But what if you are supposed to be together?

546
00:53:40,930 --> 00:53:42,720
We're not, honey.

547
00:53:42,780 --> 00:53:45,710
- But how can you know for sure?
- We just know.

548
00:53:46,460 --> 00:53:52,260
And when you're a grown-up, you'll understand.

549
00:53:52,920 --> 00:53:55,170
I don't wanna understand!

550
00:53:55,270 --> 00:53:56,910
Juliet, wait!

551
00:53:56,980 --> 00:53:59,220
I don't wanna understand!

552
00:53:59,290 --> 00:54:00,680
Stop! We gotta talk about this!

553
00:54:00,700 --> 00:54:01,900
There's nothing to talk about, James.

554
00:54:02,070 --> 00:54:04,220
We have to let Jack do what he came here to do.

555
00:54:04,280 --> 00:54:06,380
Well, maybe you shoulda told
me you had a change of heart

556
00:54:06,530 --> 00:54:08,560
before I brought him out in
the jungle to kick his ass.

557
00:54:08,610 --> 00:54:09,550
- Would that have stopped you?
- No.

558
00:54:09,670 --> 00:54:12,220
Well, then I'm glad you finally
got it out of your system.

559
00:54:14,080 --> 00:54:16,040
Don't.

560
00:54:16,240 --> 00:54:19,660
I need you to tell me where
all this is coming from.

561
00:54:19,770 --> 00:54:22,110
I mean, one minute, you're
leading the great sub escape,

562
00:54:22,240 --> 00:54:25,770
and now you're on board with
blowing up the damn island?

563
00:54:26,420 --> 00:54:30,250
I got a right to know why
you changed your mind.

564
00:54:33,080 --> 00:54:36,140
I changed my mind when I saw you look at her.

565
00:54:36,970 --> 00:54:39,820
Don't.

566
00:54:40,380 --> 00:54:43,530
I don't care who I looked at.

567
00:54:43,550 --> 00:54:46,070
I'm with you.

568
00:54:46,740 --> 00:54:52,930
And you would stay with me forever if I let
you, and that is why I will always love you.

569
00:54:52,990 --> 00:54:54,710
- You don't... 
- What we had, it was just for a little while. 

570
00:54:54,840 --> 00:54:58,590
And just because we love each other,
it doesn't mean that we're meant to be together.

571
00:54:58,720 --> 00:55:01,240
I mean, maybe we were never
supposed to be together.

572
00:55:01,330 --> 00:55:06,580
So if Jack can make it that... that none
of you ever come here, then he should.

573
00:55:08,760 --> 00:55:11,860
Why you doing this, Juliet?

574
00:55:16,820 --> 00:55:19,390
I...

575
00:55:21,540 --> 00:55:26,710
If I never meet you, then I never have to lose you.

576
00:55:40,190 --> 00:55:42,530
Radzinsky!

577
00:55:42,810 --> 00:55:44,280
What is it now?

578
00:55:44,280 --> 00:55:46,880
The gauss readings has jumped off the charts.

579
00:55:47,600 --> 00:55:50,030
Let me see.

580
00:55:50,300 --> 00:55:51,570
This is it!

581
00:55:51,570 --> 00:55:52,710
We're on top of the pocket!

582
00:55:52,800 --> 00:55:56,220
If we keep drilling and hit that
pocket, all hell is gonna break loose!

583
00:55:56,370 --> 00:55:58,500
<i>Radzinsky, are you there? Over.</i>

584
00:55:59,130 --> 00:56:00,500
<i>Stuart, come in!</i>

585
00:56:00,560 --> 00:56:01,870
What do you want, Phil?

586
00:56:01,980 --> 00:56:04,280
That hostile that shot the kid? He came back.

587
00:56:04,400 --> 00:56:06,060
What the hell are you talking about?

588
00:56:06,170 --> 00:56:07,720
Here at the barracks.

589
00:56:07,720 --> 00:56:10,210
He... he attacked us and then got
rescued by some of the other recruits.

590
00:56:10,250 --> 00:56:12,060
They stole a van and took off.

591
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:13,790
Took off where?

592
00:56:13,840 --> 00:56:16,800
I don't know, but Roger said
that one of them had a bomb.

593
00:56:16,900 --> 00:56:19,990
That hostile knows about the Swan!

594
00:56:20,120 --> 00:56:24,540
Get some men and some guns, and
get your asses out here right now!

595
00:56:24,540 --> 00:56:26,910
If they're coming here,
we're gonna be ready for 'em.

596
00:56:28,940 --> 00:56:31,420
Come on! Keep it on the ground!

597
00:56:31,550 --> 00:56:33,720
Jack?

598
00:56:33,750 --> 00:56:35,580
What happened?

599
00:56:37,480 --> 00:56:40,520
Yeah, my talk with Sawyer didn't go so good.

600
00:56:40,740 --> 00:56:43,360
- Does it hurt?
- Ah, it's okay.

601
00:56:43,440 --> 00:56:44,890
Okay.

602
00:56:51,880 --> 00:56:53,840
Do you remember when I sewed you up?

603
00:56:53,920 --> 00:56:55,480
When we first got here?

604
00:56:55,580 --> 00:56:57,710
Yeah.

605
00:56:57,930 --> 00:57:00,620
Seems like a million years ago.

606
00:57:00,780 --> 00:57:03,630
Or 30 years from now.

607
00:57:12,840 --> 00:57:17,540
Kate, why'd you make me
promise to never ask about Aaron?

608
00:57:20,220 --> 00:57:23,540
Because I was...

609
00:57:23,540 --> 00:57:28,260
so angry with you for making me come back here.

610
00:57:28,260 --> 00:57:31,580
Is he why you came back?

611
00:57:31,580 --> 00:57:37,050
I came back so he could be where
he belongs... with his mother.

612
00:57:37,050 --> 00:57:40,280
If this works, Claire will
never come to the island,

613
00:57:40,280 --> 00:57:42,470
and they'll always be together,
just the way they're meant to be.

614
00:57:42,470 --> 00:57:45,730
- She was gonna give him up for adoption, Jack.
- Well, you don't know what she would do.

615
00:57:45,730 --> 00:57:49,520
And whatever it is, it would be her choice.

616
00:57:49,520 --> 00:57:53,420
If you wanna save Claire,
this is the only way to do it.

617
00:57:53,420 --> 00:57:58,600
Nothing... nothing in my
life has ever felt so right.

618
00:57:58,600 --> 00:58:01,150
And...

619
00:58:01,450 --> 00:58:06,090
I just need you to believe that.

620
00:58:12,270 --> 00:58:13,860
Go!

621
00:58:13,860 --> 00:58:16,240
Keep going!

622
00:58:18,600 --> 00:58:20,810
Keep the drill going!

623
00:58:20,810 --> 00:58:23,980
It's about to happen.

624
00:58:27,830 --> 00:58:33,270
Are you with me on this?

625
00:58:36,160 --> 00:58:40,090
- Yes.
- Then let's go.

626
00:58:49,220 --> 00:58:51,960
One wallet.

627
00:58:52,300 --> 00:58:55,890
$227 cash.

628
00:58:55,890 --> 00:58:59,330
One ballpoint pen.

629
00:58:59,330 --> 00:59:01,830
One fruit roll-up.

630
00:59:01,830 --> 00:59:03,030
Sign here.

631
00:59:03,030 --> 00:59:05,250
You don't understand. This is a big mistake.

632
00:59:05,250 --> 00:59:08,050
I killed a bunch of people.

633
00:59:08,420 --> 00:59:12,500
You see this? This is a discharge form.
You've been cleared.

634
00:59:12,500 --> 00:59:14,880
So take your stuff and go.

635
00:59:14,880 --> 00:59:16,850
Look, dude...

636
00:59:16,850 --> 00:59:20,590
There are men with tranquilizer
guns hunting me down like an animal.

637
00:59:20,590 --> 00:59:23,720
They wanna bring me somewhere against my will.

638
00:59:23,720 --> 00:59:28,350
There's a cab stand right out front.

639
00:59:34,930 --> 00:59:36,730
Sorry. I didn't see it was taken, dude.

640
00:59:36,730 --> 00:59:39,000
Actually, I'm only going a
few blocks if you wanna share.

641
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:40,270
Cool. Are you sure?

642
00:59:40,270 --> 00:59:42,660
Come on in.

643
00:59:49,030 --> 00:59:51,610
You want some? It's cherry.

644
00:59:51,610 --> 00:59:54,470
No thanks.

645
00:59:55,060 --> 00:59:56,900
So what were you in for?

646
00:59:56,900 --> 00:59:59,540
- Excuse me?
- Jail.

647
00:59:59,540 --> 01:00:02,110
I was there 'cause I killed three people.

648
01:00:02,110 --> 01:00:05,580
But I didn't really. I guess they figured it out.

649
01:00:05,580 --> 01:00:07,110
What about you?

650
01:00:07,110 --> 01:00:10,220
I wasn't in jail.

651
01:00:10,220 --> 01:00:14,180
Well, then what were you
doing sitting outside a prison?

652
01:00:14,180 --> 01:00:15,770
In a cab?

653
01:00:15,770 --> 01:00:19,220
I was waitin' for you, Hugo.

654
01:00:21,540 --> 01:00:23,510
Then you must be dead.

655
01:00:23,510 --> 01:00:27,560
I'm definitely not dead.

656
01:00:27,970 --> 01:00:30,740
What do you want from me?

657
01:00:30,740 --> 01:00:34,880
I wanna know why you won't go back to the island.

658
01:00:40,150 --> 01:00:42,250
'Cause I'm cursed.

659
01:00:42,250 --> 01:00:45,650
Is that so?

660
01:00:45,650 --> 01:00:51,460
That's why the plane crashed,
my friends died... Libby, Charlie.

661
01:00:51,460 --> 01:00:56,680
Now they visit me, and I can't make it stop.

662
01:00:56,680 --> 01:00:59,600
What if you weren't cursed?

663
01:00:59,600 --> 01:01:01,650
What if you were blessed?

664
01:01:01,650 --> 01:01:02,820
How do you mean "blessed"?

665
01:01:02,850 --> 01:01:07,680
Well, you get to talk to the people you've lost...

666
01:01:07,680 --> 01:01:10,330
seems like a pretty wonderful thing to me.

667
01:01:10,330 --> 01:01:13,980
Oh, sure it's wonderful, except
for the part where I'm crazy.

668
01:01:13,980 --> 01:01:18,130
I've got some news for you, Hugo, and
you're just gonna have to take my word on this.

669
01:01:18,130 --> 01:01:22,120
You are not crazy.

670
01:01:26,620 --> 01:01:28,610
Who are you, dude?

671
01:01:28,610 --> 01:01:32,810
I'm just up here on the corner.

672
01:01:33,070 --> 01:01:37,140
Ajira Airways flight 316 out
of L.A.X. leaves in 24 hours.

673
01:01:37,140 --> 01:01:40,190
All you have to do is be on that plane.

674
01:01:40,190 --> 01:01:43,060
It's your choice, Hugo.

675
01:01:43,060 --> 01:01:47,420
You don't have to do anything you don't want to.

676
01:01:49,920 --> 01:01:52,290
Wait! You forgot your guitar.

677
01:01:52,290 --> 01:01:55,260
It's not my guitar.

678
01:01:58,280 --> 01:01:59,810
Don't worry, dude.

679
01:01:59,810 --> 01:02:03,720
Everything'll be fine when Jack changes the future...

680
01:02:03,720 --> 01:02:06,010
Or the past.

681
01:02:06,010 --> 01:02:07,940
One of those.

682
01:02:07,940 --> 01:02:10,800
I don't think your buddy's gonna make it.

683
01:02:10,800 --> 01:02:13,680
He'll make it.

684
01:02:13,680 --> 01:02:16,210
Dude, what happened to your face?

685
01:02:16,210 --> 01:02:18,920
Nothin'.

686
01:02:18,920 --> 01:02:23,390
We were just up on a ridge where
we could look down into the Swan site.

687
01:02:23,390 --> 01:02:25,680
Something just happened down there.

688
01:02:25,680 --> 01:02:27,560
They hit something.

689
01:02:27,560 --> 01:02:29,150
It's time for me to go.

690
01:02:29,150 --> 01:02:30,920
It's all set to go.

691
01:02:30,920 --> 01:02:33,410
Remember, be careful.

692
01:02:33,410 --> 01:02:36,450
It's rigged to explode on impact.

693
01:02:36,450 --> 01:02:44,120
According to Faraday's plan, you must get the bomb
as close as you can to the source of electromagnetism.

694
01:02:44,120 --> 01:02:46,690
Sayid, this is gonna work.

695
01:02:46,690 --> 01:02:49,770
And it'll save ya.

696
01:02:49,770 --> 01:02:53,570
Nothing can save me.

697
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:45,330
See ya in Los Angeles.

698
01:04:15,020 --> 01:04:17,620
Are you sure you need to do this?

699
01:04:18,050 --> 01:04:20,510
If you waited, Jacob would
eventually come to you, John.

700
01:04:20,510 --> 01:04:23,300
I'm tired of waiting.

701
01:04:23,300 --> 01:04:27,960
Where is he, Richard?

702
01:04:32,520 --> 01:04:37,070
What happened to the rest of the statue?

703
01:04:37,370 --> 01:04:40,400
I don't know. It was like that when I got here.

704
01:04:40,400 --> 01:04:44,780
Do you expect me to believe that?

705
01:04:44,780 --> 01:04:47,880
Not really.

706
01:04:47,880 --> 01:04:51,410
All right, Ben, let's go.

707
01:05:01,390 --> 01:05:04,450
W-what are you doing?

708
01:05:04,850 --> 01:05:06,730
John wants me to join him.

709
01:05:06,730 --> 01:05:08,300
- You can't bring him in.
- Why not?

710
01:05:08,300 --> 01:05:10,840
Because only our leader can
request an audience with Jacob,

711
01:05:10,840 --> 01:05:13,040
and there can only be one leader
on the island at a time, John.

712
01:05:13,040 --> 01:05:17,740
I'm beginning to think you just make
these rules up as you go along, Richard.

713
01:05:17,740 --> 01:05:23,830
Ben is coming in with me, and if that's a
problem, I'm sure Jacob and I can work it out.

714
01:05:54,860 --> 01:05:57,790
Tell him I said hello.

715
01:06:30,940 --> 01:06:34,730
Will you be able to do this, Ben?

716
01:06:34,730 --> 01:06:38,540
I know it won't be easy, but things will change...

717
01:06:38,540 --> 01:06:42,550
once he's gone.

718
01:06:45,680 --> 01:06:48,660
I promise.

719
01:07:16,180 --> 01:07:18,130
Can I ask you something, LaFleur?

720
01:07:18,130 --> 01:07:21,950
There ain't no more LaFleur, Enos. Go ahead, shoot.

721
01:07:21,950 --> 01:07:25,310
Has it occurred to any of you that
your buddy's actually gonna cause

722
01:07:25,310 --> 01:07:30,160
the thing he says he's trying to prevent?

723
01:07:30,160 --> 01:07:34,350
Perhaps that little nuke is the incident?

724
01:07:34,350 --> 01:07:41,220
So maybe the best thing to do... is nothing?

725
01:07:41,990 --> 01:07:45,470
I'm glad you all thought this through.

726
01:07:49,090 --> 01:07:51,150
What's going on?

727
01:07:51,150 --> 01:07:54,740
It's Phil. That's the road to the Swan.

728
01:07:54,740 --> 01:07:58,860
If they see Jack, they're gonna kill him.

729
01:07:58,860 --> 01:08:03,120
What do you think, blondie?

730
01:08:04,020 --> 01:08:08,580
Live together and die alone.

731
01:08:19,930 --> 01:08:21,450
Good for you. You got here fast.

732
01:08:21,450 --> 01:08:23,950
- Any sign of 'em yet?
- No, not yet. You got time to set up a perimeter.

733
01:08:23,950 --> 01:08:25,230
You called these men to the site?

734
01:08:25,230 --> 01:08:26,560
You, rear ridgeline.

735
01:08:26,560 --> 01:08:29,810
- You, top ridgeline.
- We need to be getting people away from here!

736
01:08:29,810 --> 01:08:34,220
You, top of the scaffolding. Go now!

737
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:09,400
There!

738
01:09:18,860 --> 01:09:20,950
Get him!

739
01:09:23,100 --> 01:09:26,080
Flank him! Get him now!

740
01:09:30,970 --> 01:09:33,850
Who's this?

741
01:10:10,930 --> 01:10:12,990
Drop it, Phil, or you're a dead man!

742
01:10:12,990 --> 01:10:13,950
Tell 'em to put their guns down.

743
01:10:13,950 --> 01:10:16,620
Drop the guns! Drop the guns!

744
01:10:19,010 --> 01:10:22,150
All right, you can come out now, doc!

745
01:10:29,040 --> 01:10:32,190
Hurry up and do your business.

746
01:10:34,980 --> 01:10:38,020
Turn that damn thing off!

747
01:10:42,510 --> 01:10:44,770
What's the matter?

748
01:10:44,770 --> 01:10:46,760
It won't shut down!

749
01:10:46,760 --> 01:10:47,960
Why not?

750
01:10:47,960 --> 01:10:49,730
Something's pulling the drill down.

751
01:10:49,730 --> 01:10:52,620
We hit the pocket!

752
01:11:01,590 --> 01:11:03,280
Hurry up, doc! What are you waiting for?

753
01:11:03,280 --> 01:11:05,670
Drop it!

754
01:11:58,970 --> 01:12:02,560
This don't look like L.A.X.

755
01:12:31,790 --> 01:12:33,970
Dad!

756
01:12:39,810 --> 01:12:41,680
Jack!

757
01:12:51,220 --> 01:12:52,660
Get away from here!

758
01:12:52,660 --> 01:12:55,070
Get as far away from here as you can!

759
01:12:56,530 --> 01:12:58,950
- Get in!
- What the hell's going on?

760
01:12:58,950 --> 01:13:00,660
Get out of here!

761
01:13:00,660 --> 01:13:03,020
Come on!

762
01:13:05,990 --> 01:13:08,270
Go!

763
01:13:15,660 --> 01:13:18,320
Hey, LaFleur!

764
01:13:29,450 --> 01:13:33,210
- Help!
- Juliet!

765
01:13:35,280 --> 01:13:37,460
- Ah, come on!
- Sawyer! Help!

766
01:13:37,460 --> 01:13:40,170
Juliet!

767
01:13:41,210 --> 01:13:43,570
Sawyer!

768
01:13:52,460 --> 01:13:55,720
Where do you think you're going, blondie?

769
01:13:57,690 --> 01:14:02,120
Kate! Help me get those chains off!

770
01:14:04,120 --> 01:14:06,420
Hold on! You hold on!

771
01:14:06,420 --> 01:14:08,460
I can't. I can't get it off.

772
01:14:08,460 --> 01:14:10,160
I got you.

773
01:14:10,160 --> 01:14:12,830
I can't...

774
01:14:18,090 --> 01:14:21,190
- I can't reach her.
- You hold on!

775
01:14:25,810 --> 01:14:29,010
I got you.

776
01:14:29,160 --> 01:14:31,620
Sawyer!

777
01:14:35,950 --> 01:14:38,340
Don't you leave me.

778
01:14:38,340 --> 01:14:41,020
- It's okay.
- Don't you leave me!

779
01:14:41,590 --> 01:14:43,780
- I love you.
- No, you don't let go!

780
01:14:43,780 --> 01:14:46,090
- I love you, James.
- No.

781
01:14:46,090 --> 01:14:47,700
I love you so much.

782
01:14:47,700 --> 01:14:50,620
No! No, don't let go!

783
01:14:50,620 --> 01:14:53,760
Juliet! No!

784
01:15:16,240 --> 01:15:17,950
Water?

785
01:15:17,950 --> 01:15:20,670
Do you have any alcohol?

786
01:15:20,930 --> 01:15:24,510
No. Sure wish I did.

787
01:15:31,970 --> 01:15:34,440
Don't shoot.

788
01:15:34,440 --> 01:15:37,480
It's okay.

789
01:15:37,480 --> 01:15:40,580
It's all right.

790
01:15:46,850 --> 01:15:50,310
Which one of you is Ricardus?

791
01:15:57,210 --> 01:16:01,060
It's Richard, actually.

792
01:16:01,310 --> 01:16:05,990
What lies in the shadow of the statue?

793
01:16:08,890 --> 01:16:13,800
<i>Ille qui nos omnes servabit.</i>

794
01:16:15,560 --> 01:16:20,480
Richard... I'm Ilana.

795
01:16:20,630 --> 01:16:23,440
I have something you need to see.

796
01:16:23,440 --> 01:16:24,970
Open it up.

797
01:16:24,970 --> 01:16:28,650
It's... it's okay. It's okay. Let them.

798
01:16:59,250 --> 01:17:00,960
Where did you find him?

799
01:17:00,960 --> 01:17:04,820
In the cargo hold of the plane we came here on...

800
01:17:06,390 --> 01:17:09,340
In a coffin.

801
01:17:12,350 --> 01:17:15,150
I don't understand.

802
01:17:15,150 --> 01:17:18,510
If this is Locke...

803
01:17:18,510 --> 01:17:22,580
who's in there?

804
01:18:19,140 --> 01:18:22,340
You like it?

805
01:18:23,870 --> 01:18:27,150
I did it myself.

806
01:18:29,700 --> 01:18:33,920
It takes a very long time when
you're making the thread, but, uh...

807
01:18:33,920 --> 01:18:38,370
I suppose that's the point, isn't it?

808
01:18:38,370 --> 01:18:42,090
Hello, Jacob.

809
01:18:44,330 --> 01:18:47,740
You found your loophole.

810
01:18:47,740 --> 01:18:52,890
Indeed I did.

811
01:18:55,120 --> 01:19:03,750
And you have no idea
what I've gone through to be here.

812
01:19:05,930 --> 01:19:07,870
Have you met before?

813
01:19:07,870 --> 01:19:12,210
In a manner of speaking.

814
01:19:15,420 --> 01:19:20,120
Do what I asked you to, Ben.

815
01:19:21,850 --> 01:19:24,460
Benjamin...

816
01:19:24,460 --> 01:19:31,090
Whatever he's told you, I want
you to understand one thing.

817
01:19:31,640 --> 01:19:36,290
You have a choice.

818
01:19:37,480 --> 01:19:40,260
What "choice"?

819
01:19:40,260 --> 01:19:48,310
You can do what he asked,
or you can go, leave us to discuss our...

820
01:19:48,310 --> 01:19:52,470
issues.

821
01:19:55,500 --> 01:20:05,400
So now, after all this time,
you've decided to stop ignoring me.

822
01:20:05,400 --> 01:20:14,630
35 years I lived on this island, and all
I ever heard was your name over and over.

823
01:20:14,630 --> 01:20:22,800
Richard would bring me your instructions...
all those slips of paper, all those lists...

824
01:20:22,800 --> 01:20:26,290
And I never questioned anything.

825
01:20:26,290 --> 01:20:31,640
I did as I was told.

826
01:20:31,640 --> 01:20:40,030
But when I dared to ask to see you
myself, I was told: "You have to wait".

827
01:20:40,030 --> 01:20:44,700
"You have to be patient".

828
01:20:44,700 --> 01:20:48,610
But when he asked to see you?

829
01:20:48,610 --> 01:20:55,800
He gets marched straight
up here as if he was Moses.

830
01:20:59,520 --> 01:21:03,770
So... why him?

831
01:21:09,220 --> 01:21:14,040
What was it that was so wrong with me?

832
01:21:17,570 --> 01:21:22,090
What about me?

833
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:27,750
What about you?

834
01:21:34,740 --> 01:21:36,490
Well...

835
01:21:46,530 --> 01:21:49,560
They're coming.

836
01:21:49,560 --> 01:21:51,650
What?

837
01:21:52,630 --> 01:21:54,290
I can't hear you.

838
01:21:54,290 --> 01:21:57,700
They're coming.

839
01:22:20,570 --> 01:22:23,320
Sawyer, get off of there!

840
01:22:23,320 --> 01:22:27,220
We have to go right now. We need to go!

841
01:22:27,800 --> 01:22:29,360
Get off.

842
01:22:29,360 --> 01:22:32,150
It's going down! This thing is
gonna go! You have to let it go.

843
01:22:32,150 --> 01:22:35,730
You have to go. This thing is
going to blow at any second.

844
01:22:35,730 --> 01:22:36,800
Jack!

845
01:22:36,800 --> 01:22:39,130
Jack, help me get him off.

846
01:23:53,920 --> 01:23:56,240
Come on!

847
01:23:56,240 --> 01:23:59,000
Come on!

848
01:24:00,280 --> 01:24:03,030
Come on!

849
01:24:03,030 --> 01:24:05,830
Come on, you son of a bitch!
