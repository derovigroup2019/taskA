00:00:00,001 --> 00:00:02,320
<i>Previously on "Lost":

2
00:00:08,116 --> 00:00:11,019
- Is that Benjamin Linus?
- We need you to save his life.

3
00:00:11,228 --> 00:00:14,384
If I take him, he's not
ever gonna be the same again.

4
00:00:14,462 --> 00:00:16,237
<i>He will always be
one of us.</i>

5
00:00:16,853 --> 00:00:20,066
Get your ass out here right now,
or I'm gonna kill your daughter.

6
00:00:20,196 --> 00:00:22,894
I stole her as a baby
from an insane woman.

7
00:00:23,008 --> 00:00:25,559
<i>She means nothing to me.</i>
So if you want to kill her,

8
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:26,573
go ahead
and do it--

9
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:28,791
<i>This guy is dangerous.</i>

10
00:00:28,914 --> 00:00:32,108
Sun, that boat I came here
on was filled with commandos

11
00:00:32,183 --> 00:00:34,535
whose only mission
was to get him.

12
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:36,504
And how'd that work out
for everyone?

13
00:00:39,580 --> 00:00:41,718
- You know him?
- Yeah.

14
00:00:44,477 --> 00:00:45,871
He's the man who killed me.

15
00:01:12,149 --> 00:01:13,813
- What have you done, Richard?
- Calm down!

16
00:01:13,899 --> 00:01:15,216
Calm down. This has
nothing to do with you.

17
00:01:15,293 --> 00:01:16,118
So it's true?

18
00:01:16,246 --> 00:01:17,847
You actually brought one
of them to our temple?

19
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:19,862
He's just a boy,
and he was dying.

20
00:01:19,945 --> 00:01:21,622
Then you should've
let him die.

21
00:01:21,705 --> 00:01:22,725
Jacob wanted it done.

22
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:28,317
The island chooses is
the island's chooses.

23
00:01:28,368 --> 00:01:29,381
You know that.

24
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:34,710
Yes.
Yes, of course.

25
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:38,432
What's his name?

26
00:01:58,260 --> 00:01:59,603
Hello, Benjamin.

27
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:02,564
What happened?

28
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:05,189
You were injured.

29
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:08,047
How?

30
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:10,231
You don't remember?

31
00:02:10,730 --> 00:02:12,680
Where am I?

32
00:02:12,730 --> 00:02:15,642
You're among friends.

33
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:18,499
We're going to
take care of you.

34
00:02:18,609 --> 00:02:20,693
My dad.
Is he here?

35
00:02:21,128 --> 00:02:22,823
You'll be back to him
soon enough.

36
00:02:22,930 --> 00:02:24,864
No. No,
I don't want to go back.

37
00:02:25,612 --> 00:02:27,926
- Okay, easy. Easy.
- Oh!

38
00:02:29,014 --> 00:02:30,689
I don't want to go back.

39
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,117
I wanna stay.

40
00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:38,165
I wanna be
one of you.

41
00:02:39,631 --> 00:02:41,455
Just because you're
living with them,

42
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:43,821
doesn't mean
you can't be one of us.

43
00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:46,290
You should be dead,
Benjamin.

44
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:47,720
But this island...

45
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:50,800
It saved your life.

46
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:54,285
Who are you?

47
00:02:55,830 --> 00:02:57,078
I'm Charles.

48
00:02:59,130 --> 00:03:00,389
Charles Widmore.

49
00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:08,186
Ben.

50
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:19,236
Hello, Ben.

51
00:03:21,130 --> 00:03:23,375
Welcome back to the
Land of the Living.

52
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,836
My God!

53
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:31,094
You're alive!

54
00:03:31,759 --> 00:03:32,825
Yes, I am.

55
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:36,786
I knew it.

56
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:39,592
I knew that this
would happen.

57
00:03:41,771 --> 00:03:43,861
Then why are you so
surprised to see me?

58
00:03:45,682 --> 00:03:48,250
Because it's one thing
to believe it, John.

59
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:52,216
It's another thing
to see it.

60
00:03:52,530 --> 00:03:55,085
Then why were you trying to
run away to the main island?

61
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:59,760
I broke the rules,
John.

62
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:02,312
I came back to the island.

63
00:04:03,058 --> 00:04:05,360
I was going to answer
for what I'd done.

64
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:07,297
I was going back...

65
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,656
To be judged.

66
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:15,539
Judged?

67
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:20,414
By whom?

68
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:22,796
Well, J-John...

69
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:25,524
We don't even
have a word for it.

70
00:04:27,330 --> 00:04:29,609
But I believe you call it
'The Monster'.

74
00:04:59,687 --> 00:05:00,427
Morning.

75
00:05:00,601 --> 00:05:01,805
Hello.

76
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:03,727
What's in the crate?

77
00:05:04,430 --> 00:05:06,275
Just some stuff
we need to get moved.

78
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:07,982
Need a hand?

79
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:10,875
Oh, thanks.
We got it.

80
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:13,903
Okay.
Have a great day.

81
00:05:27,230 --> 00:05:28,590
How you feeling,
my friend?

82
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:32,371
Like someone hit me with an oar,
but I'll live.

83
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:37,485
- What do you make of him?
- <i>I'm not sure.</i>

84
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:41,136
What has he told you?

85
00:05:41,330 --> 00:05:44,246
When you were out cold,
he was watching over you.

86
00:05:46,397 --> 00:05:48,157
And he said
you killed him.

87
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:49,330
I killed him?

88
00:05:51,130 --> 00:05:53,173
Really?
'Cause he looks fine to me.

89
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,874
You know, I don't really
remember him from the plane.

90
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:06,256
- Do you?
- No, I don't.

91
00:06:09,930 --> 00:06:11,131
What if...

92
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:15,461
he was already here,
before we crashed?

93
00:06:15,496 --> 00:06:18,728
If he thinks I killed him,
then he's insane.

94
00:06:18,731 --> 00:06:21,460
We may be dealing with a man
who's dangerously deranged.

95
00:06:21,530 --> 00:06:24,723
Then the question is:
What are we gonna do about it?

96
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:27,252
Don't worry,
my friend.

97
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:33,058
I have your back.

98
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:37,195
Caesar.

99
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:40,268
Pleasure to meet you, Caesar.
I'm Ben.

100
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:00,840
You want me to do it?

101
00:07:00,841 --> 00:07:01,550
Shh.

102
00:07:04,208 --> 00:07:05,970
I can do it if
you want me to, Ben.

103
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,242
Shut up!

104
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:10,543
And stay here, Ethan.

105
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,206
Don't!
Don't do it.

106
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:55,540
You're the one who infected us,
aren't you?!

107
00:07:55,541 --> 00:07:58,400
You're the one
who infected us!

108
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:07,693
No! Shh.

109
00:08:08,831 --> 00:08:11,353
It's okay.
It's okay, baby.

110
00:08:15,930 --> 00:08:18,398
Please,
don't take my Alex!

111
00:08:19,917 --> 00:08:21,354
Do you want
your baby to live?

112
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:22,986
Why are you taking her?!

113
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:28,204
Be grateful
you're still alive.

114
00:08:29,130 --> 00:08:30,601
Now you listen to me.

115
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:35,000
If you try to follow me or if
you ever come looking for me,

116
00:08:35,060 --> 00:08:35,871
I'll kill you.

117
00:08:36,661 --> 00:08:38,286
<i>And if you want
your child to live,</i>

118
00:08:38,378 --> 00:08:42,129
every time you hear whispers,
you run the other way.

119
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:13,578
<i>What's that?</i>

120
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:18,539
Just something sentimental.

121
00:09:27,382 --> 00:09:29,364
So this is
your old office, huh?

122
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:34,714
I never pictured you
leading your people

123
00:09:34,792 --> 00:09:37,199
from behind a desk.

124
00:09:37,530 --> 00:09:38,599
It seems a little...

125
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:41,593
Corporate.

126
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:51,132
Was there something
that you needed, John?

127
00:09:51,214 --> 00:09:52,126
<i>Well, Ben,
I was hoping</i>

128
00:09:52,192 --> 00:09:55,001
that you and I could talk
about the elephant in the room.

129
00:09:58,030 --> 00:10:00,366
I assume you're referring to
the fact that I killed you.

130
00:10:00,930 --> 00:10:01,808
Yeah.

131
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,605
It was the only way to
get you back to the island.

132
00:10:12,330 --> 00:10:14,950
Along with as many of
those who left as possible.

133
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:17,634
You do remember, John--
That's why you left in the first place,

134
00:10:17,685 --> 00:10:19,009
to convince 'em
to come back?

135
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,270
But you failed.

136
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:25,016
And the only way
to bring them together

137
00:10:25,062 --> 00:10:26,585
was by your death,
and you understood that.

138
00:10:26,642 --> 00:10:28,837
It's why you were about to kill
yourself when I stopped you.

139
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:32,165
If all I had to do was die, Ben,
then why did you stop me?

140
00:10:32,241 --> 00:10:34,244
You had critical information
that would've died with you.

141
00:10:35,530 --> 00:10:36,955
And once
you'd given it to me...

142
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:43,120
Well, I just didn't have time

143
00:10:43,156 --> 00:10:44,806
to talk you back
into hanging yourself.

144
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:48,196
So I took a shortcut.

145
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:51,208
And look at you, John.
I was right.

146
00:10:52,437 --> 00:10:54,808
You're here. You're back.
So are the rest of them.

147
00:10:54,884 --> 00:10:57,970
I don't know where yet exactly,
but they came. It worked.

148
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:05,383
And that's why
I did it.

149
00:11:07,130 --> 00:11:09,494
Because it was in the best
interests of the island.

150
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:13,195
I was just hoping
for an apology.

151
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:24,093
I've decided
to help you, Ben.

152
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:27,034
Help me do what?

153
00:11:27,132 --> 00:11:30,124
Do what you say you
are on your way to do.

154
00:11:30,830 --> 00:11:32,339
Be judged.

155
00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:33,929
That's not something
you want to see, John.

156
00:11:34,002 --> 00:11:34,966
If everything you've done

157
00:11:35,017 --> 00:11:37,270
has been in the best
interests of the island...

158
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:44,354
Then I'm sure
the Monster will understand.

159
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:51,684
Let's go.

160
00:11:59,746 --> 00:12:01,001
<i>Hey!</i>

161
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:04,939
- What are you doing?
- We're taking a boat.

162
00:12:05,330 --> 00:12:06,717
Where?

163
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:08,540
Over to the main island.

164
00:12:10,805 --> 00:12:12,262
I don't think so,
my friend.

165
00:12:12,530 --> 00:12:14,330
Are these your boats?

166
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,475
Are they yours?

167
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:18,817
Caesar, right?

168
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,242
I was under the impression
these were found here

169
00:12:21,318 --> 00:12:22,705
so I'm just
gonna borrow one.

170
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:24,463
I'm happy to leave
the other boat for you

171
00:12:24,524 --> 00:12:27,313
- in case you want to follow us.  
- "Us"?

172
00:12:27,985 --> 00:12:29,974
Are you
going with him?

173
00:12:30,147 --> 00:12:32,563
He didn't really
give me a choice.

174
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:39,438
I'm sorry,
but I'm calling the shots here.

175
00:12:39,630 --> 00:12:41,302
And I said
you are not taking anything.

176
00:12:41,830 --> 00:12:43,581
What you are going to do
is to sit down

177
00:12:43,674 --> 00:12:45,040
and tell us how you know
so much

178
00:12:45,122 --> 00:12:47,696
about this island,
my friend.

179
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:53,397
You're in the habit of
calling people, "Friend."

180
00:12:54,673 --> 00:12:56,067
But I don't think
you mean it.

181
00:12:56,060 --> 00:12:57,930
- Step away from the boat. 
- No.

182
00:12:57,931 --> 00:12:59,600
I'm not gonna step
away from the boat.

183
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:00,409
I'm gonna take it,

184
00:13:00,479 --> 00:13:02,002
and you're gonna let me,
my friend.

185
00:13:02,096 --> 00:13:03,102
You're not taking anything.

186
00:13:03,184 --> 00:13:04,371
You looking for this?

187
00:13:12,530 --> 00:13:14,833
This gentleman and I
are taking a boat.

188
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:18,769
Does anyone else have
a problem with that?

189
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,553
Consider that
my apology.

190
00:14:00,430 --> 00:14:02,282
Home,
sweet home.

191
00:14:04,083 --> 00:14:05,444
Looks like
we're not the first ones

192
00:14:05,530 --> 00:14:06,854
who decided to
tie up here.

193
00:14:08,769 --> 00:14:10,408
That would be
Sun and Lapidus.

194
00:14:11,351 --> 00:14:12,894
I showed 'em
where the boats were,

195
00:14:12,991 --> 00:14:15,809
and Sun thanked me by smashing
me on the head with a paddle.

196
00:14:15,844 --> 00:14:18,151
Oh. Is she the one
that hurt your arm?

197
00:14:19,236 --> 00:14:21,330
I noticed you were
favoring it on the way over.

198
00:14:21,805 --> 00:14:22,594
<i>No.</i>

199
00:14:25,641 --> 00:14:27,603
Someone else hurt my arm.

200
00:14:27,741 --> 00:14:31,303
You just make friends
everywhere you go, don't ya?

201
00:14:31,390 --> 00:14:33,924
Well, I've found sometimes
that friends can be

202
00:14:33,985 --> 00:14:37,209
significantly more
dangerous than enemies, John.

203
00:14:38,153 --> 00:14:40,290
Is that why you shot an
unarmed man in the chest?

204
00:14:40,529 --> 00:14:43,242
The man was unarmed
because I'd stolen his gun--

205
00:14:43,330 --> 00:14:44,941
The gun he was going
to use to kill you.

206
00:14:46,410 --> 00:14:47,704
I couldn't let that happen.

207
00:14:47,789 --> 00:14:49,795
No sense in me
dying twice, right?

208
00:14:50,589 --> 00:14:51,754
You're welcome.

209
00:14:53,936 --> 00:14:55,969
We're going to your old house,
aren't we?

210
00:14:56,814 --> 00:14:57,564
Yes.

211
00:14:57,700 --> 00:14:59,916
It's the only place
I can summon it...

212
00:15:01,288 --> 00:15:02,272
The "Monster."

213
00:15:04,125 --> 00:15:06,310
Once it arrives,
I'll either be forgiven...

214
00:15:08,722 --> 00:15:09,781
Or I won't.

215
00:15:09,816 --> 00:15:11,168
I think you're lying.

216
00:15:14,403 --> 00:15:16,151
Lying about what?

217
00:15:16,237 --> 00:15:17,871
That you want to be judged
for leaving the island

218
00:15:17,928 --> 00:15:20,426
and coming back because
it's against the rules.

219
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:22,940
I don't think
you care about rules.

220
00:15:23,021 --> 00:15:24,722
Then what do I want to be
judged for, John?

221
00:15:25,845 --> 00:15:27,338
For killing your daughter.

222
00:15:50,165 --> 00:15:50,996
Well...

223
00:15:51,630 --> 00:15:53,191
Did you do it?

224
00:15:56,449 --> 00:15:59,601
We had a...
complication.

225
00:16:02,030 --> 00:16:05,658
I'm sorry.
Is that a... baby?

226
00:16:07,891 --> 00:16:10,111
Your orders were to
exterminate that woman.

227
00:16:10,208 --> 00:16:12,742
Why? She's no threat to us.
She's insane, Charles.

228
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:16,172
Besides, you didn't
tell me she had a child.

229
00:16:17,115 --> 00:16:19,478
What was it
I was supposed to do?

230
00:16:19,601 --> 00:16:20,735
Kill it.

231
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:22,688
It's not an "it."
This is a child.

232
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:33,377
You might find this difficult
to understand, Benjamin...

233
00:16:34,081 --> 00:16:35,896
Every decision I've made
has been about

234
00:16:35,979 --> 00:16:37,429
protecting this island.

235
00:16:37,523 --> 00:16:39,426
Is killing this baby
what Jacob wants?

236
00:16:49,004 --> 00:16:50,060
Then here she is.

237
00:16:55,687 --> 00:16:56,561
You do it.

238
00:17:38,132 --> 00:17:40,392
So whose idea was it
to move into these houses?

239
00:17:41,715 --> 00:17:42,899
Excuse me?

240
00:17:43,509 --> 00:17:45,176
Well, your people were living
in the jungle.

241
00:17:45,268 --> 00:17:47,641
And then after you
murdered the Dharma folk,

242
00:17:47,737 --> 00:17:48,599
you relocated here.

243
00:17:48,665 --> 00:17:50,286
I just wondered if it
was your idea.

244
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:55,507
Do you disapprove,
John?

245
00:17:55,722 --> 00:17:58,264
It just doesn't seem like
something the island would want.

246
00:17:58,299 --> 00:18:00,711
You don't have the first
idea what this island wants.

247
00:18:01,262 --> 00:18:02,400
Are you sure about that?

248
00:18:11,012 --> 00:18:12,446
That was your house,
wasn't it?

249
00:18:12,493 --> 00:18:14,193
Yes, and that's Alex's room.

250
00:18:16,492 --> 00:18:19,428
Well, I suppose you better go over
there and check it out.

251
00:19:07,712 --> 00:19:09,003
Sun?

252
00:19:13,299 --> 00:19:14,350
What are you doing here?

253
00:19:14,492 --> 00:19:17,385
This used to be my house.
I saw a light turned on.

254
00:19:17,457 --> 00:19:19,043
What are the two of you
doing in here?

255
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:32,400
- <i>That was taken in 1977.</i>
- Are you trying to tell me

256
00:19:32,477 --> 00:19:34,053
that your friends were
in the Dharma Initiative?

257
00:19:34,230 --> 00:19:35,306
You don't know about this?

258
00:19:37,323 --> 00:19:38,306
Of course not.

259
00:19:39,623 --> 00:19:41,602
Where did you get this?
Who gave this to you?

260
00:19:41,694 --> 00:19:43,594
We met some
crazy old man outside.

261
00:19:43,682 --> 00:19:45,240
He said
his name was Christian.

262
00:19:47,416 --> 00:19:49,927
- He told us to come in here and wait.
- Wait for what?

263
00:19:50,060 --> 00:19:52,617
He said if I ever wanted
to see my husband again,

264
00:19:52,716 --> 00:19:54,406
I had to wait here
for John Locke.

265
00:19:56,213 --> 00:19:59,057
But considering he's dead,
we ain't holding our breath.

266
00:19:59,139 --> 00:20:00,773
Well, you might
want to look outside.

267
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:24,521
What you're saying,
it's...

268
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:26,435
Impossible.

269
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:27,943
But here I am.

270
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:31,671
I don't know how,
I don't know why, but...

271
00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:33,875
I'm sure there's a
very good reason for it.

272
00:20:33,969 --> 00:20:36,185
As long as the dead guy
says there's a reason,

273
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:38,041
well, then I guess everything's
gonna be just peachy.

274
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:41,120
<i>And forget about the fact
that the rest of your people</i>

275
00:20:41,206 --> 00:20:42,773
<i>are supposedly
30 years ago...</i>

276
00:20:42,871 --> 00:20:44,628
Now the only ones who
are here to help us...

277
00:20:45,333 --> 00:20:47,442
are a murderer and a guy
who can't seem to remember

278
00:20:47,508 --> 00:20:48,815
how the hell
he got out of a coffin.

279
00:20:49,105 --> 00:20:53,649
Sun, please,
let's just go back to the plane,

280
00:20:53,649 --> 00:20:55,011
see if I can
fix the radio,

281
00:20:55,073 --> 00:20:56,312
and maybe we can
get some help.

282
00:20:59,576 --> 00:21:01,013
If you leave with him,

283
00:21:01,096 --> 00:21:02,431
you'll never find
your husband again.

284
00:21:05,246 --> 00:21:06,496
I'm all the
help you need.

285
00:21:07,230 --> 00:21:08,868
Are you saying you
know how to find them?

286
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:11,468
How to find Jin?

287
00:21:11,565 --> 00:21:13,032
I have some ideas.

288
00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:14,753
<i>I'm sorry to say,
but--</i>

289
00:21:15,330 --> 00:21:16,973
I'm leaving with
or without you.

290
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:20,874
If there's any chance
of finding my husband,

291
00:21:20,941 --> 00:21:22,521
then I have to stay.

292
00:21:23,530 --> 00:21:25,078
All right.

293
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:32,219
Well, for God's sake,
watch your back.

294
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:41,938
All right.

295
00:21:43,060 --> 00:21:44,376
How do we find Jin?

296
00:21:45,830 --> 00:21:48,863
Ben has something to do first.
Isn't that right, Ben?

297
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:53,357
Yes, John.
That's right.

298
00:21:53,429 --> 00:21:54,813
Better get to it then.

299
00:23:37,530 --> 00:23:38,807
I'll be outside.

300
00:23:46,530 --> 00:23:47,723
Again, daddy!
Again!

301
00:23:47,810 --> 00:23:50,712
Okay. Okay.
Wow, Alex!

302
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:52,916
Any higher, and you're gonna
fly right off the island.

303
00:23:57,551 --> 00:23:59,215
The sub's
about to leave.

304
00:23:59,430 --> 00:24:00,861
Higher, daddy!
Higher!

305
00:24:02,060 --> 00:24:03,002
All right.

306
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:05,437
You don't have
to see him off, Ben.

307
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:07,857
Yes, Richard, I do.

308
00:24:08,060 --> 00:24:09,621
Higher!
Higher, daddy!

309
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:19,040
<i>Charles!</i>

310
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:25,503
I came to say good-bye.

311
00:24:26,177 --> 00:24:29,149
No, you didn't.
You came to gloat.

312
00:24:29,149 --> 00:24:31,036
No, don't act
as if I wanted this.

313
00:24:31,207 --> 00:24:32,494
You brought this on yourself.

314
00:24:32,571 --> 00:24:34,725
Are you quite certain you want
to do this, Benjamin?

315
00:24:34,839 --> 00:24:36,844
<i>You left the island regularly.</i>

316
00:24:36,930 --> 00:24:39,001
You had a daughter
with an outsider.

317
00:24:39,084 --> 00:24:40,321
<i>You broke the rules,
Charles.</i>

318
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:42,995
And what makes you think you
deserve to take what's mine?

319
00:24:43,077 --> 00:24:44,670
<i>Because I won't be selfish.</i>

320
00:24:45,030 --> 00:24:48,013
Because I'll sacrifice
anything to protect this island.

321
00:24:48,083 --> 00:24:49,577
You wouldn't sacrifice Alex.

322
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:51,831
You're the one who
wanted her dead, Charles.

323
00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:53,910
Not the island.

324
00:24:57,100 --> 00:24:58,501
I hope you're right,
Benjamin.

325
00:24:58,593 --> 00:24:59,718
Because if you aren't,

326
00:25:00,432 --> 00:25:02,497
and it is the island
that wants her dead...

327
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:04,702
She'll be dead.

328
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:06,515
<i>And one day...</i>

329
00:25:06,607 --> 00:25:08,809
You'll be standing
where I'm standing now.

330
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:11,870
You'll be the
one being banished.

331
00:25:12,533 --> 00:25:14,157
And then
you'll finally realize

332
00:25:15,014 --> 00:25:16,812
that you cannot
fight the inevitable.

333
00:25:21,260 --> 00:25:23,146
I'll be seeing you, boy.

334
00:25:45,730 --> 00:25:47,049
Where did John go?

335
00:25:47,660 --> 00:25:49,360
He said he had
something to do.

336
00:25:50,610 --> 00:25:51,988
Did he say
what it was?

337
00:25:52,660 --> 00:25:54,602
No, I didn't ask.

338
00:25:58,600 --> 00:25:59,987
Jack must have lied.

339
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:02,426
- Excuse me?
- <i>About Locke being dead?</i>

340
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:05,550
I don't know why he would,
but that's the only explanation.

341
00:26:05,550 --> 00:26:09,197
Jack didn't lie.
John was dead.

342
00:26:09,281 --> 00:26:10,800
<i>Just because
he was in a coffin</i>

343
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:12,268
doesn't mean that he
couldn't have faked his dea--

344
00:26:12,329 --> 00:26:14,351
Trust me.
I'm sure.

345
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,977
So you knew
this would happen to Locke

346
00:26:23,062 --> 00:26:24,890
if we brought him
back here?

347
00:26:27,153 --> 00:26:29,065
Sun, I had no idea it
would happen.

348
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:32,114
I've seen this island
do miraculous things.

349
00:26:32,180 --> 00:26:34,620
I've seen it
heal the sick,

350
00:26:34,698 --> 00:26:37,590
but never once has it
done anything like this.

351
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:41,882
Dead is dead.

352
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:45,355
You don't get to
come back from that.

353
00:26:45,930 --> 00:26:47,149
Not even here.

354
00:26:49,097 --> 00:26:51,712
So the fact that John Locke
is walking around this island...

355
00:26:53,130 --> 00:26:55,092
Scares the living hell
out of me.

356
00:27:05,630 --> 00:27:06,954
You may want
to go inside.

357
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:08,429
Why?

358
00:27:11,012 --> 00:27:12,835
Because what's about to
come out of that jungle...

359
00:27:13,486 --> 00:27:15,303
is something
I can't control.

360
00:27:22,827 --> 00:27:24,410
Any luck?

361
00:27:25,638 --> 00:27:27,539
It hasn't shown up yet.

362
00:27:28,355 --> 00:27:30,677
Last time we didn't
have to wait this long.

363
00:27:30,770 --> 00:27:32,861
It's not a train, John.
It doesn't run on a schedule.

364
00:27:34,264 --> 00:27:36,612
Well, if it's not gonna
come to us, then...

365
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:39,404
I suppose
we'll have to go to it.

366
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:43,039
It doesn't work that way.
I only know how to summon it.

367
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:45,140
I don't know
where it actually is.

368
00:27:46,834 --> 00:27:48,160
I do.

369
00:27:58,530 --> 00:27:59,840
It's weird for me, too.

370
00:28:01,830 --> 00:28:03,123
Excuse me?

371
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:06,457
I realize how
strange this all is--

372
00:28:08,060 --> 00:28:09,502
Me, here.

373
00:28:11,530 --> 00:28:13,520
But I assure you,
Sun,

374
00:28:13,599 --> 00:28:15,182
I'm the same man
I've always been.

375
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:20,357
Are you ready?

376
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:22,595
Lead the way.

377
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:33,743
<i>Hello?</i>

378
00:28:33,844 --> 00:28:36,463
<i>Charles?</i>
It's Benjamin.

379
00:28:36,730 --> 00:28:38,319
<i>How did you get
this number?</i>

380
00:28:38,399 --> 00:28:40,276
Doesn't matter.
What matters is...

381
00:28:40,362 --> 00:28:42,492
I'm going back
to the island today.

382
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,291
The island won't let
you come back, trust me.

383
00:28:45,378 --> 00:28:48,071
I've spent almost 20 years
trying to return.

384
00:28:48,230 --> 00:28:51,564
Well, Charles, where you failed,
I'm going to succeed...

385
00:28:52,905 --> 00:28:54,807
Just as soon
as I do one thing.

386
00:28:55,930 --> 00:28:57,742
And what's that,
Benjamin?

387
00:28:58,130 --> 00:28:59,586
Kill your daughter.

388
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:04,576
In fact, I'm looking at
"our mutual friend" right now.

389
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:07,727
I don't know what
you're talking about.

390
00:29:08,030 --> 00:29:09,560
It's the name of the
boat that Penny's on.

391
00:29:10,143 --> 00:29:11,557
Don't you dare.

392
00:29:12,130 --> 00:29:14,015
Good-bye, Charles.

393
00:29:24,830 --> 00:29:26,437
May I ask you
a question, John?

394
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:27,821
Shoot.

395
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:30,225
How is it that you
know where you're going?

396
00:29:33,187 --> 00:29:34,318
I just know.

397
00:29:34,930 --> 00:29:36,339
I mean,
how does that work, exactly?

398
00:29:36,339 --> 00:29:37,153
How does what work?

399
00:29:37,153 --> 00:29:40,311
The knowing. I mean,
did it come upon you gradually,

400
00:29:40,372 --> 00:29:42,057
or did you wake up
one morning

401
00:29:42,115 --> 00:29:44,059
suddenly understanding the
mysteries of the Universe?

402
00:29:44,059 --> 00:29:46,287
- You don't like this, do you?
- What?

403
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,250
Having to ask questions

404
00:29:48,333 --> 00:29:49,955
that you don't know
the answers to.

405
00:29:50,079 --> 00:29:52,296
Blindly following
someone in the hopes that

406
00:29:52,332 --> 00:29:54,469
they'll lead you to whatever it is
you're looking for.

407
00:29:57,560 --> 00:29:59,366
No, John,
I don't like it at all.

408
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:03,685
Well, now you know what
it was like to be me.

409
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:10,844
We should keep moving.

410
00:30:12,508 --> 00:30:13,882
Yes, we should.

411
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:21,677
<i>I think I know where
we're going now, John.</i>

412
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:22,539
Do you?

413
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:25,232
It's the same place they
brought me as a child.

414
00:30:27,460 --> 00:30:29,145
It's where
the island healed me.

415
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:30,976
Well...

416
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,890
Let's hope it's as generous
this time around.

417
00:30:44,830 --> 00:30:46,033
What is it?

418
00:30:47,300 --> 00:30:48,676
It's the wall
around our temple.

419
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:52,509
What temple?

420
00:30:53,730 --> 00:30:55,211
<i>About a half mile
from here.</i>

421
00:30:55,979 --> 00:30:58,399
We built this wall to keep
people like the two of you

422
00:30:58,455 --> 00:30:59,721
from ever seeing it.

423
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:07,564
We're not going
into your temple, Ben.

424
00:31:17,430 --> 00:31:18,620
We're going under it.

425
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:31,687
After you.

426
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:40,616
I need to ask
a favor of you, Sun.

427
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:43,030
<i>If you can ever
get off this island,</i>

428
00:31:43,405 --> 00:31:46,780
find Desmond Hume for me.
Tell him I said I was sorry.

429
00:31:48,330 --> 00:31:49,791
Sorry for what?

430
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:53,750
He'll know.

431
00:32:29,264 --> 00:32:30,196
Hey!

432
00:32:30,860 --> 00:32:32,104
What are you
doing here?

433
00:32:37,060 --> 00:32:38,087
Desmond!

434
00:32:39,300 --> 00:32:40,384
Desmond!

435
00:32:40,730 --> 00:32:41,706
<i>Des?!</i>

436
00:32:41,730 --> 00:32:42,727
Don't move.

437
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:45,479
Not another word.

438
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:49,243
Hello, Penelope.

439
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:51,139
My name is
Benjamin Linus.

440
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:54,348
I'm sorry that you're caught
up in the middle of this thing,

441
00:32:54,374 --> 00:32:55,913
- but your father--
- My father and I

442
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:58,049
have absolutely no relationship
whatsoever, so whatever--

443
00:32:58,085 --> 00:32:59,818
Your father is a
really terrible human being.

444
00:33:01,860 --> 00:33:03,820
He's responsible for the
killing of my daughter.

445
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:04,944
That's why I'm here.

446
00:33:06,030 --> 00:33:06,893
Mommy!

447
00:33:09,430 --> 00:33:11,287
Charlie,
go back inside, babe.

448
00:33:11,730 --> 00:33:14,717
Go back inside. Please.

449
00:33:14,829 --> 00:33:16,867
Please, whatever you do,
don't hurt my son.

450
00:33:16,929 --> 00:33:19,803
- Please don't hurt my son.
- <i>Mommy?</i>

451
00:33:20,639 --> 00:33:21,678
Mommy?

452
00:33:21,776 --> 00:33:22,934
Charlie, go inside!

453
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:56,005
<i>Captain Lapidus!
Captain Lapidus!</i>

454
00:33:56,730 --> 00:33:58,588
You're back.
Thank God!

455
00:33:59,172 --> 00:34:00,874
They found guns.

456
00:34:01,583 --> 00:34:03,192
What are you talking about?
Who found guns?

457
00:34:03,192 --> 00:34:04,868
Ilana and
three of the others.

458
00:34:05,493 --> 00:34:07,490
They said
they were in charge now.

459
00:34:08,182 --> 00:34:09,244
Where are they?

460
00:34:17,530 --> 00:34:18,663
Ilana!

461
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:23,967
What's going on?

462
00:34:24,002 --> 00:34:26,456
What lies in the
shadow of the statue?

463
00:34:27,738 --> 00:34:28,699
What?

464
00:34:28,774 --> 00:34:30,288
Answer the question!

465
00:34:31,900 --> 00:34:35,327
What lies in the
shadow of the statue?

466
00:34:38,402 --> 00:34:40,185
I have no idea
what the--

467
00:34:43,730 --> 00:34:47,405
Get everyone else.
Tell them it's time.

468
00:34:47,497 --> 00:34:48,609
<i>And tie him up.</i>

469
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:52,235
He's coming with us.

470
00:35:26,660 --> 00:35:28,083
You know,
you were right.

471
00:35:29,130 --> 00:35:30,205
About what?

472
00:35:30,930 --> 00:35:32,846
Why I need
to be judged.

473
00:35:34,094 --> 00:35:35,876
When Charles Widmore's
men came,

474
00:35:35,947 --> 00:35:37,092
they gave me a choice.

475
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:41,858
Either leave the island
or let my daughter die.

476
00:35:43,660 --> 00:35:46,184
All I had to do was
walk out of the house

477
00:35:46,276 --> 00:35:47,236
and go with them.

478
00:35:50,700 --> 00:35:52,046
But I didn't do it.

479
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:54,965
So you were right.

480
00:35:55,479 --> 00:35:59,170
John, I did kill Alex.

481
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:04,476
And now I have to
answer for that.

482
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:11,342
I appreciate you
showing me the way,

483
00:36:11,409 --> 00:36:13,135
but I think I can
take it from here.

484
00:36:16,730 --> 00:36:18,157
You got it.

485
00:36:26,212 --> 00:36:28,944
I'll meet you outside.
If I live--

486
00:36:32,860 --> 00:36:34,087
Ben!

487
00:36:37,900 --> 00:36:39,160
Are you all right?

488
00:36:41,547 --> 00:36:43,270
Never better.

489
00:36:44,166 --> 00:36:46,139
Hang on. I'll find something
to get you out of there.

490
00:36:46,860 --> 00:36:48,865
John, wait!

491
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:30,069
<i>You didn't tell me that
she had a child.</i>

492
00:38:30,130 --> 00:38:32,258
What was it
I was supposed to do?

493
00:38:33,263 --> 00:38:36,107
- Kill it.
- <i>It's not an "it." This is a child.</i>

494
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:39,405
Higher!
Again, daddy! Again!

495
00:38:40,260 --> 00:38:42,046
<i>Higher!
Higher, daddy!</i>

496
00:38:42,500 --> 00:38:43,409
<i>I hate you!</i>

497
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:46,700
I hate your guts!
I wish you were dead.

498
00:38:48,260 --> 00:38:49,421
These people--

499
00:38:50,100 --> 00:38:51,423
You said they're dangerous.

500
00:38:52,730 --> 00:38:54,220
More dangerous than you?

501
00:38:54,630 --> 00:38:57,658
<i>Dad, they're serious.</i>

502
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:01,333
They killed
Karl and my mother.

503
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:03,890
<i>Please, Dad.</i>

504
00:39:05,953 --> 00:39:07,727
Help me!

505
00:39:08,460 --> 00:39:09,598
<i>She's not my daughter.</i>

506
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:11,732
<i>She means
nothing to me.</i>

507
00:39:11,930 --> 00:39:14,872
So if you wanna kill her,
go ahead and--

508
00:39:37,060 --> 00:39:38,427
Daddy?

509
00:39:42,327 --> 00:39:43,526
Alex.

510
00:39:44,752 --> 00:39:46,328
Hi, dad.

511
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:50,065
Ohh, Alex.

512
00:39:54,460 --> 00:39:56,454
I'm so, so sorry.

513
00:40:01,730 --> 00:40:04,128
It was all my fault.

514
00:40:07,300 --> 00:40:08,607
I know.

515
00:40:16,230 --> 00:40:17,762
Listen to me,
you bastard!

516
00:40:18,304 --> 00:40:21,662
I know that you're already
planning to kill John again,

517
00:40:21,786 --> 00:40:25,093
and I want you to know that
if you so much as touch him,

518
00:40:25,212 --> 00:40:28,903
I will hunt you down
and destroy you.

519
00:40:29,876 --> 00:40:33,092
You will listen to every word
John Locke says,

520
00:40:33,163 --> 00:40:35,314
and you will follow
his every order.

521
00:40:35,391 --> 00:40:36,316
Do you understand?

522
00:40:39,100 --> 00:40:39,795
Say it!

523
00:40:40,260 --> 00:40:41,651
Say you'll follow him.

524
00:40:41,730 --> 00:40:44,056
Yes, I will.
I'll follow him. I swear.

525
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:12,041
<i>Ben?</i>

526
00:41:17,030 --> 00:41:18,160
Ben!

527
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:23,256
Ben?

528
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:30,768
