<i>FARADAY: Whatever Ben Linus did down

00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:06,000

<i>JULIET: The island is
moving through time?</i>

5
00:00:07,610 --> 00:00:11,280
Yeah, either the island is,
or we are.

6
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:17,010
I need you to go back
to Oxford University.

7
00:00:17,110 --> 00:00:18,745
Go back to where we met!

8
00:00:18,845 --> 00:00:20,775
I need you to go there and
find my mother! Her name is--

9
00:00:20,875 --> 00:00:23,075
Are you all right?

10
00:00:23,175 --> 00:00:24,185
I was on the island.

11
00:00:24,285 --> 00:00:26,515
You've been off the
island for three years.

12
00:00:26,615 --> 00:00:28,945
You're safe now.
It was just a dream.

13
00:00:30,145 --> 00:00:32,645
It wasn't a dream, Pen.

14
00:00:33,045 --> 00:00:34,580
It was a memory.

15
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:50,945
Efren Salonga?

16
00:00:51,045 --> 00:00:52,580
Ef-efren Salonga!

17
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:54,210
Efren Salonga?

18
00:00:57,380 --> 00:00:59,845
Efren Salonga!

19
00:00:59,945 --> 00:01:01,350
Efren Salonga!

20
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:05,840
Efren Salonga!

21
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,680
Efren Salonga?

22
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:12,380
Who are you?

23
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:13,845
Are you the doctor?

24
00:01:15,345 --> 00:01:17,515
Yes.
What's the matter with you?

25
00:01:22,580 --> 00:01:24,210
You're sure you know
what you're doing, yeah?

26
00:01:24,310 --> 00:01:26,175
- Yes, yes!
- Because there's a lot of blood, man!

27
00:01:26,275 --> 00:01:28,510
- How much blood?
- I'm coming, Penny!

28
00:01:31,580 --> 00:01:33,615
It's okay, Pen. We've got a doctor.

29
00:01:33,715 --> 00:01:35,745
Where have you been?!

30
00:01:35,845 --> 00:01:38,645
It's gonna be okay.
It's gonna be okay. Okay, here you go.

31
00:01:38,745 --> 00:01:41,810
Okay. Just breathe, Penny, okay?
J-just breathe.

32
00:01:41,910 --> 00:01:43,775
Oh! Breathe.

33
00:01:43,875 --> 00:01:45,717
- I can't breathe.
- You're doing great.

34
00:01:45,817 --> 00:01:46,980
You're doing great, okay.

35
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:49,745
Okay, just be strong, yeah? Okay.

36
00:01:49,845 --> 00:01:51,710
- Make it come out.
- Please be strong.

37
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:55,615
Hold it. Hold it.

38
00:01:55,715 --> 00:01:57,175
I can't!

39
00:01:57,275 --> 00:01:59,175
Yes, you-- yes, you can, Penny.

40
00:01:59,275 --> 00:02:00,810
Push! Push!

41
00:02:00,910 --> 00:02:04,380
Okay, push now, Penny. Push. Now!

42
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:06,845
Come on, Penny. That's it. It's coming.

43
00:02:06,945 --> 00:02:09,680
- Come on, Penny.
- Push harder! Push!

44
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:11,845
I can see the head! I can see the head!

45
00:02:11,945 --> 00:02:13,940
- One more time! Push!
- I can see it. It's just coming.

46
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,286
It's coming! It's coming!

47
00:02:15,386 --> 00:02:16,561
You got it.

48
00:02:21,210 --> 00:02:24,445
You did it.

49
00:02:24,945 --> 00:02:26,415
You did it.

50
00:02:26,515 --> 00:02:29,215
<i>Oh, my God, Penny. You did it.</i>

51
00:02:29,715 --> 00:02:31,980
It's a boy.

52
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:41,445
I love you, Penny. I love you.

53
00:02:41,545 --> 00:02:44,210
Oh, oh, he's beautiful. Beautiful.

54
00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:47,775
Oh, my God. He's so beautiful.

55
00:02:47,875 --> 00:02:50,610
Oh, my God.

56
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:54,680
I love you.

57
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:56,210
I love you.

58
00:02:58,410 --> 00:03:00,350
I love you.

59
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:20,880
Look.

60
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:23,940
Right out there.

61
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:27,580
Beyond where you can see,
there's--there's an island,

62
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:30,480
and it's a very special island.

63
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:35,010
I left it a long time ago.

64
00:03:35,110 --> 00:03:37,715
I never thought I'd see it again.

65
00:03:37,815 --> 00:03:40,945
It's called Great Britain.

66
00:03:41,045 --> 00:03:44,345
And the most beautiful part
of the island is Scotland,

67
00:03:44,445 --> 00:03:46,345
and that's where your daddy's from.

68
00:03:46,445 --> 00:03:51,045
There's mountains and glens
and monsters in deep lochs, and...

69
00:03:54,310 --> 00:03:57,445
And it's where your mommy and daddy...

70
00:03:57,545 --> 00:03:58,975
fell in love.

71
00:03:59,075 --> 00:04:01,950
<i>It's also where he broke her heart.</i>

72
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,280
Yeah, well, I...

73
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:12,075
I thought I'd leave
that wee bit out of it.

74
00:04:12,775 --> 00:04:15,580
You also left out the bit
about his grandfather,

75
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:19,395
the man who sent a boat to the island
to kill all daddy's friends.

76
00:04:19,545 --> 00:04:22,845
We'll be in and out.
He'll never know we're here, Penny.

77
00:04:23,945 --> 00:04:26,680
Don't underestimate him, Desmond.

78
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:30,115
If he finds out we're here,
I don't know what he'll do.

79
00:04:30,215 --> 00:04:32,915
But this has nothing to do
with your father, Penny.

80
00:04:34,215 --> 00:04:37,340
We are here because of Daniel Faraday.

81
00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:41,280
What he told me -

82
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:45,050
that everyone on that
island is in danger,

83
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:48,910
and I am the only one
that can help them.

84
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:54,610
I have to do this, Penny.

85
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:00,910
Are you sure that's what he said?

86
00:05:01,210 --> 00:05:03,415
Yeah, Sawyer said to meet at the creek,

87
00:05:03,515 --> 00:05:05,910
so unless he got torched
by a flaming arrow,

88
00:05:06,010 --> 00:05:08,680
that's where he and
everyone else should be.

89
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:13,245
Hey, how's your headache?

90
00:05:13,445 --> 00:05:14,875
Worse, actually.

91
00:05:14,975 --> 00:05:17,075
But considering we're
running for our lives,

92
00:05:17,175 --> 00:05:18,545
I'm not gonna complain.

93
00:05:18,645 --> 00:05:21,645
You have any dizziness or double vision?

94
00:05:22,245 --> 00:05:24,080
Both, actually.

95
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:30,750
Why do you look so worried?

96
00:05:33,410 --> 00:05:35,110
Is it because you know
what's happening to me?

97
00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:39,345
Listen to me. Nothing is
gonna happen to you. Nothing.

98
00:05:40,245 --> 00:05:42,315
I won't let it.

99
00:05:43,515 --> 00:05:45,610
<i>Hey, we're here!</i>

100
00:05:50,010 --> 00:05:52,140
<i>Some rendezvous. It's just us.</i>

101
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:55,470
Well, we should probably wait,
see if they show up.

102
00:05:55,570 --> 00:05:56,900
They could be right behind us.

103
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,945
- Yeah, or they came and left.
- Or they're dead.

104
00:06:00,045 --> 00:06:03,330
Miles, that right there,
that kind of attitude...

105
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:05,945
Not exactly what we need right now.

106
00:06:06,045 --> 00:06:08,980
People are scared enough
as it is. Miles...

107
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:14,910
Miles?

108
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:23,050
Wait! Don't move!

109
00:06:57,050 --> 00:06:58,880
Who's in charge here?

110
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:00,980
He is.

111
00:07:10,350 --> 00:07:12,540
You just couldn't stay away, could you?

Lost S05E03 "Jughead"

114
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:39,895
Did he finish his breakfast?

115
00:07:39,995 --> 00:07:41,325
Yeah.

116
00:07:41,425 --> 00:07:44,460
Gave me a bit of a fight,
but he listens in the end...

117
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,090
Unlike his father.

118
00:07:49,890 --> 00:07:51,860
Look, honey,

119
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:54,625
all I have to do is find his mother,

120
00:07:54,725 --> 00:07:56,625
tell her he's still on the island,

121
00:07:56,725 --> 00:07:58,336
and then I'm done with this for good.

122
00:07:58,486 --> 00:07:59,310
<i>Why now?</i>

123
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:01,085
I mean, if he told you
all this on the island,

124
00:08:01,185 --> 00:08:03,750
why didn't you remember
it until two days ago?

125
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:05,730
I don't know.

126
00:08:06,230 --> 00:08:08,330
Look, I don't understand
how any of this works

127
00:08:08,430 --> 00:08:10,825
any more than you do it.

128
00:08:11,025 --> 00:08:13,960
Look, I know it happened.

129
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:19,430
Daniel Faraday knocked on the hatch door

130
00:08:19,530 --> 00:08:21,625
and told me to go to Oxford.

131
00:08:21,725 --> 00:08:23,195
Everyone was in danger,

132
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:25,760
and I was the only one
that could save them.

133
00:08:28,890 --> 00:08:31,260
I know how insane it sounds.

134
00:08:37,430 --> 00:08:39,330
I'll be back by dark,

135
00:08:39,430 --> 00:08:41,230
and then I'm done...

136
00:08:41,330 --> 00:08:43,160
Forever.

137
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:45,660
I promise.

138
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:57,195
If you're gonna promise
me something, Des,

139
00:08:57,295 --> 00:09:00,530
can you promise me you'll never
go back to that island again?

140
00:09:01,330 --> 00:09:03,860
Why in god's name would
I wanna go back there?

141
00:09:18,790 --> 00:09:20,795
There were 20 of you at the beach,

142
00:09:20,895 --> 00:09:22,395
but only five of you here.

143
00:09:22,495 --> 00:09:24,295
Where are the rest of your people?

144
00:09:24,395 --> 00:09:27,060
Maybe they got blown up by
some more of your land mines.

145
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:29,895
We didn't put them here. You did.

146
00:09:33,095 --> 00:09:34,795
Once we leave here,

147
00:09:34,895 --> 00:09:37,795
I will be out of control
of what happens to you.

148
00:09:37,895 --> 00:09:39,625
But if you cooperate now,

149
00:09:39,725 --> 00:09:41,865
things will go much easier for you.

150
00:09:42,065 --> 00:09:44,660
So where are the rest of your people?

151
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:50,530
I don't know.

152
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:02,965
Who are these people?

153
00:10:03,265 --> 00:10:04,350
Well, gee, I didn't have time...

154
00:10:04,450 --> 00:10:05,890
to ask that, with
Frogurt on fire and all.

155
00:10:05,990 --> 00:10:07,865
They attacked us on the beach.

156
00:10:08,065 --> 00:10:11,930
This is a 30-caliber
M1 Garand rifle. It looks new.

157
00:10:12,030 --> 00:10:14,065
Who cares about the rifle?
Where the hell have you been?

158
00:10:14,165 --> 00:10:16,230
If you've been going
through what I have, James,

159
00:10:16,330 --> 00:10:18,760
maybe the more appropriate
question would be:

160
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:20,760
<i>When the hell have I been?</i>

161
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:26,125
- What happened to your leg?
- I got shot.

162
00:10:26,425 --> 00:10:28,790
<i>- By who?
- We can swap stories later.</i>

163
00:10:28,890 --> 00:10:30,930
We told the rest of our group
that we would meet them at the creek.

164
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:33,825
If there's any chance of reconnecting
with them, we'd better get moving.

165
00:10:33,925 --> 00:10:34,925
Fine, seeing as we have no rope

166
00:10:35,425 --> 00:10:37,895
to make sure these two
don't try to kill us again.

167
00:10:37,995 --> 00:10:41,215
- Guess we're gonna have to shoot 'em.
- Quare non sunt vestitus eis?

168
00:10:41,365 --> 00:10:43,371
- Tace!
- What?

169
00:10:48,221 --> 00:10:50,335
(Latin)

170
00:10:50,630 --> 00:10:53,145
- And what language is that?
- They're speaking Latin.

171
00:10:53,295 --> 00:10:55,995
That one asked why we aren't in uniform,

172
00:10:56,095 --> 00:10:58,025
and this one told him to shut up.

173
00:10:58,525 --> 00:11:01,930
And how is it that they know
how to speak Latin, Juliet?

174
00:11:02,230 --> 00:11:04,695
The same reason I do.

175
00:11:06,195 --> 00:11:08,090
Because they're Others.

176
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,560
- Hey.
- Yeah.

177
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:40,525
- We just walked over a fresh grave.
- What?

178
00:11:41,025 --> 00:11:43,330
Four U.S. soldiers,

179
00:11:44,230 --> 00:11:46,325
dead just under a month.

180
00:11:46,425 --> 00:11:48,495
Three of them were shot.

181
00:11:48,595 --> 00:11:51,390
One died of radiation poisoning.

182
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:54,830
Miles, hey, hey.

183
00:11:54,930 --> 00:11:57,465
Did any of them happen
to mention what year it is?

184
00:11:57,565 --> 00:11:59,360
We're here.

185
00:12:11,990 --> 00:12:14,300
Richard? We're back.

186
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:32,095
Caught the three by the creek.

187
00:12:32,495 --> 00:12:34,490
This one's their leader.

188
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,095
What's your name?

189
00:12:43,195 --> 00:12:44,825
<i>What's your name?</i>

190
00:12:46,525 --> 00:12:48,600
My name is Richard Alpert.

191
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:53,430
I assume you've come back for your bomb.

192
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:07,760
No, I'm sorry, sir.

193
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:09,795
I'm not finding a record of any Faraday.

194
00:13:09,895 --> 00:13:11,425
No, that--that's impossible.

195
00:13:11,525 --> 00:13:13,675
'cause I know her son
was a professor here.

196
00:13:13,775 --> 00:13:15,875
His name's Daniel Faraday.
I'm sure he's in your database.

197
00:13:15,975 --> 00:13:17,565
There's no record of any Faraday

198
00:13:17,665 --> 00:13:19,150
ever having been
employed here at Oxford.

199
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:20,895
I visited him.

200
00:13:22,395 --> 00:13:24,430
I went to his lab. It was in an attic.

201
00:13:24,530 --> 00:13:27,160
It was...
it was above the physics department.

202
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:29,130
The archives go back quite far.

203
00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:30,895
Perhaps there was a clerical error.

204
00:13:30,995 --> 00:13:33,245
You don't happen to recall the year
it was in which you last visited?

205
00:13:33,345 --> 00:13:35,095
The year?

206
00:13:38,395 --> 00:13:40,360
No. I'm...

207
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:41,860
I'm not exactly sure.

208
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:44,590
May I ask why you're
seeking this information?

209
00:13:51,390 --> 00:13:53,160
Sorry I wasted your time.

210
00:15:38,730 --> 00:15:41,100
<i>Yeah, I wouldn't touch that.</i>

211
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:46,525
I wondered when someone'd figure out

212
00:15:46,625 --> 00:15:48,600
we weren't just fumigating here.

213
00:15:52,230 --> 00:15:53,960
You a professor?

214
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:56,200
No. Not exactly.

215
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,030
At least you're honest.

216
00:16:02,430 --> 00:16:04,095
So why'd you tell me not to touch it?

217
00:16:04,195 --> 00:16:06,225
Because I'm the one
who had to take the rats

218
00:16:06,325 --> 00:16:09,195
he made run through this
bloody thing down to the incinerator,

219
00:16:09,295 --> 00:16:11,325
so that no one would find
out what he was up to.

220
00:16:11,425 --> 00:16:12,565
You mean Daniel Faraday.

221
00:16:12,665 --> 00:16:14,730
Yeah. You're not the first
one to poke around here,

222
00:16:14,830 --> 00:16:16,765
asking about him and his work.

223
00:16:17,665 --> 00:16:20,865
Rumor had it, he was trying
to send rats' brains back in time.

224
00:16:22,065 --> 00:16:23,930
Ridiculous, innit?

225
00:16:26,430 --> 00:16:27,795
Aye.

226
00:16:27,895 --> 00:16:30,265
Look, I'll forget you broke my lock

227
00:16:30,365 --> 00:16:32,725
if you tell your mates
that all you found

228
00:16:32,825 --> 00:16:36,030
was rubbish left behind by a madman.

229
00:16:44,190 --> 00:16:45,700
Fair enough.

230
00:16:49,460 --> 00:16:51,095
Faraday...

231
00:16:51,395 --> 00:16:53,325
The university says
there's no record of him.

232
00:16:53,425 --> 00:16:55,125
Well, can you blame 'em?

233
00:16:55,525 --> 00:16:57,990
I mean, after what he'd
done to that poor girl?

234
00:17:01,260 --> 00:17:02,730
What girl?

235
00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:13,195
Hey, take it easy.

236
00:17:13,295 --> 00:17:16,160
It's all right, Dan. I'm fine.

237
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:19,625
We are so dead.

238
00:17:19,725 --> 00:17:21,395
Hey. No, no, no.

239
00:17:21,495 --> 00:17:23,930
We are not so dead.
We're gonna be fine.

240
00:17:24,030 --> 00:17:26,560
We just need to keep it together
until there's another flash.

241
00:17:26,660 --> 00:17:28,660
All right? Then all this disappears.

242
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:31,795
- And when's that gonna happen?
- Could be five minutes.

243
00:17:31,895 --> 00:17:34,095
Could also be 5,000 years.

244
00:17:34,195 --> 00:17:36,065
That's--that's just awesome.

245
00:17:36,365 --> 00:17:38,230
What is going on, Dan?

246
00:17:38,330 --> 00:17:40,995
- Why are they doing this to us?
- I'm not sure.

247
00:17:41,095 --> 00:17:43,865
But they must think that we're
with the American military.

248
00:17:43,965 --> 00:17:47,160
And if that's the case,
our best chance of staying alive

249
00:17:47,260 --> 00:17:50,530
is to let them keep thinking
it, all right? Let--

250
00:17:54,060 --> 00:17:56,195
Sorry. Am I interrupting?

251
00:17:56,495 --> 00:17:58,430
Ellie tells me that you're
not willing to reveal

252
00:17:58,530 --> 00:17:59,895
where the rest of your squad is.

253
00:17:59,995 --> 00:18:03,160
And why would I do that?
So you can kill them, too?

254
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:06,795
We didn't start this, friend.
Your people attacked us.

255
00:18:07,695 --> 00:18:09,930
You come to our island
to run your tests,

256
00:18:10,030 --> 00:18:11,595
you fire on us, and what,

257
00:18:11,695 --> 00:18:14,395
- you expect us not to defend ourselves?
- I don't know anything about that.

258
00:18:14,495 --> 00:18:16,660
We are scientists.

259
00:18:20,030 --> 00:18:22,495
So what? So they sent you
here to recover it?

260
00:18:22,595 --> 00:18:25,465
If you mean our hydrogen bomb, then yes.

261
00:18:26,765 --> 00:18:29,095
And I'm guessing from this
man's radiation burns

262
00:18:29,195 --> 00:18:31,265
that the housing has been compromised.

263
00:18:31,365 --> 00:18:33,060
Is that right?

264
00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:35,425
You need to listen to me.

265
00:18:35,525 --> 00:18:37,395
You have an unstable device

266
00:18:37,495 --> 00:18:40,425
that's capable of destroying
this entire island,

267
00:18:40,525 --> 00:18:42,125
and it's broken.

268
00:18:42,225 --> 00:18:44,095
If you don't allow me
to render it inert,

269
00:18:44,495 --> 00:18:46,960
all of us are gonna die.
All of us.

270
00:18:47,090 --> 00:18:50,195
How do I know you weren't sent
here on some suicide mission?

271
00:18:50,295 --> 00:18:53,605
That I'll take you out to the bomb,
and you'll just detonate it?

272
00:18:59,060 --> 00:19:00,725
Because...

273
00:19:01,625 --> 00:19:04,790
I'm in love with the
woman sitting next to me.

274
00:19:09,830 --> 00:19:12,695
And I would never...

275
00:19:13,295 --> 00:19:15,690
I would never do anything to hurt her.

276
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:23,430
All right.

277
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:25,795
Take care of your bomb,

278
00:19:25,895 --> 00:19:28,830
but you try anything else,
and you will hurt her.

279
00:19:40,430 --> 00:19:42,325
So who taught you Latin?

280
00:19:42,425 --> 00:19:44,065
Others 101.

281
00:19:44,165 --> 00:19:47,430
Gotta learn Latin -
language of the enlightened.

282
00:19:47,930 --> 00:19:49,895
Enlightened, my ass.

283
00:19:50,295 --> 00:19:52,660
I suggest you talk to us.

284
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:55,945
Once we get back to the creek
and meet up with the rest of our people,

285
00:19:56,095 --> 00:19:59,130
there's gonna be a lot of anger
directed at you for attacking them.

286
00:19:59,230 --> 00:20:02,643
The rest of your people
are either captured or dead.

287
00:20:02,743 --> 00:20:04,043
What?

288
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:07,730
What makes you say that?

289
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:12,530
That idiot shouted out,
"meet at the creek."

290
00:20:15,630 --> 00:20:18,030
We knew exactly where they were headed.

291
00:20:18,130 --> 00:20:19,630
Sent a group after them.

292
00:20:19,730 --> 00:20:21,551
Well, maybe I should've
said it in my secret language.

293
00:20:21,701 --> 00:20:23,230
James, wait.

294
00:20:23,735 --> 00:20:25,235
* We're not your enemy.

295
00:20:27,990 --> 00:20:29,615
* Then let us go.

296
00:20:29,715 --> 00:20:31,490
What the hell were you sayin'?

297
00:20:32,230 --> 00:20:34,030
* Take us to your camp.

298
00:20:36,990 --> 00:20:38,070
* Please.

299
00:20:38,170 --> 00:20:39,910
* Why would I do that?

300
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:41,160
* Is...

301
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:42,950
*...Richard there?

302
00:20:44,650 --> 00:20:45,970
* Richard Alpert?

303
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:47,795
Did you just say "Richard Alpert"?

304
00:20:47,895 --> 00:20:49,675
John, please.

305
00:20:49,875 --> 00:20:51,710
* Bring us to your camp.

306
00:20:52,370 --> 00:20:54,600
* No one else has to die.

307
00:20:57,190 --> 00:20:58,500
* Please.

308
00:21:11,260 --> 00:21:12,600
All right.

309
00:21:13,730 --> 00:21:17,525
Okay, we need to head east
another couple of kilometers

310
00:21:17,625 --> 00:21:19,060
until we hit the ridge--

311
00:21:20,790 --> 00:21:22,600
Shoot him!

312
00:21:25,430 --> 00:21:27,330
Shoot, damn it!

313
00:21:32,590 --> 00:21:34,560
Are you crazy?! What were you thinking?

314
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:36,360
Why didn't you shoot him?!

315
00:21:39,260 --> 00:21:41,060
Because...

316
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:43,230
he's one of my people.

317
00:22:11,430 --> 00:22:13,130
And who might you be?

318
00:22:13,230 --> 00:22:16,760
Uh, my name's Desmond Hume.
I'm looking for Theresa Spencer.

319
00:22:16,860 --> 00:22:18,825
I'm Abigail Spencer.
Theresa's my sister.

320
00:22:18,925 --> 00:22:21,530
All right. Um, can I
have a word with her?

321
00:22:21,630 --> 00:22:23,260
You wanna speak to Theresa?

322
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:26,710
Yeah, I got her name from a-
a gentleman I met at Oxford University.

323
00:22:26,860 --> 00:22:29,125
Um... Daniel Faraday.

324
00:22:29,225 --> 00:22:31,095
Daniel Faraday?

325
00:22:31,495 --> 00:22:33,665
Well, why didn't you say so?

326
00:22:34,365 --> 00:22:37,030
Please, you must come in.

327
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:43,460
Thanks.

328
00:22:59,930 --> 00:23:02,160
He didn't tell you, did he?

329
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:05,860
No. No, he didn't.

330
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:08,025
Can she hear us?

331
00:23:08,125 --> 00:23:11,165
No. Theresa's away right now.

332
00:23:11,265 --> 00:23:12,760
"Away"? What do you mean?

333
00:23:12,860 --> 00:23:14,725
Well, sometimes she
wakes up, thinks she's 3,

334
00:23:14,825 --> 00:23:16,995
wants to know where her dolly is.

335
00:23:17,095 --> 00:23:19,195
Yesterday, she was talking to our dad.

336
00:23:19,295 --> 00:23:21,795
He died five years ago.

337
00:23:21,895 --> 00:23:23,760
I'm sorry.

338
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:26,760
Um, this was a mistake.
I... I shouldn't have come.

339
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:29,225
Of course.

340
00:23:29,325 --> 00:23:31,625
Why would you want to stay?

341
00:23:31,725 --> 00:23:33,730
Daniel certainly didn't.

342
00:23:36,830 --> 00:23:38,530
He left her like this?

343
00:23:38,630 --> 00:23:40,925
Went running off to the States,
never to be heard from again.

344
00:23:41,025 --> 00:23:42,765
He abandoned her.

345
00:23:44,865 --> 00:23:47,130
What kind of a man does that?

346
00:23:49,630 --> 00:23:51,725
I seriously don't know
what we would've done

347
00:23:51,825 --> 00:23:53,960
if it hadn't been for Mr. Widmore.

348
00:23:54,060 --> 00:23:55,825
Uh, I'm sorry. Who?

349
00:23:55,925 --> 00:23:57,995
Daniel's benefactor.

350
00:23:58,095 --> 00:23:59,660
He funded his research,

351
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:02,695
and he took responsibility
for the result of it.

352
00:24:02,795 --> 00:24:06,025
He's been taking care of Theresa
ever since this happened to her.

353
00:24:06,625 --> 00:24:08,695
Everything here is due to Mr. Widmore,

354
00:24:08,795 --> 00:24:10,400
God bless him.

355
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:16,295
A hydrogen bomb?

356
00:24:17,295 --> 00:24:19,025
Seriously?

357
00:24:20,125 --> 00:24:21,495
Back in the '50s,

358
00:24:21,595 --> 00:24:25,000
the U.S. Government tested
H-bombs in the South Pacific.

359
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:30,100
Lucky us.

360
00:24:36,030 --> 00:24:37,730
You didn't have to say that.

361
00:24:37,830 --> 00:24:39,025
Say what?

362
00:24:39,425 --> 00:24:41,230
That you loved me.

363
00:24:42,130 --> 00:24:43,865
I mean, there are plenty of other ways

364
00:24:43,965 --> 00:24:45,875
you could've convinced him

365
00:24:45,975 --> 00:24:48,560
you weren't gonna blow
up the entire island.

366
00:24:49,260 --> 00:24:51,925
I said what I said

367
00:24:53,625 --> 00:24:55,560
because I meant it, Charlotte.

368
00:25:01,030 --> 00:25:02,765
Right, then.

369
00:25:04,365 --> 00:25:06,030
Let's go.

370
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:11,460
Back soon. I promise.

371
00:25:30,290 --> 00:25:33,825
Whatever your, uh, your
superiors told you,

372
00:25:33,925 --> 00:25:36,265
I want you to know the truth.

373
00:25:36,365 --> 00:25:39,895
A month ago, we found
18 members of an Army battalion

374
00:25:39,995 --> 00:25:42,730
right here in our jungle here,
setting up this camp.

375
00:25:42,830 --> 00:25:45,695
We gave them the opportunity
to leave the island peacefully.

376
00:25:45,795 --> 00:25:48,995
They weren't willing to do that,
so I was forced to kill them.

377
00:25:49,595 --> 00:25:51,325
All of 'em.

378
00:25:52,125 --> 00:25:53,495
- Forced?
- Yeah.

379
00:25:53,995 --> 00:25:55,630
By whom?

380
00:25:57,560 --> 00:25:59,465
You answer to someone, don't you?

381
00:25:59,565 --> 00:26:01,495
You follow a chain of command, right?

382
00:26:01,595 --> 00:26:03,460
- Yeah.
- Yeah, well, so do I.

383
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:06,600
Richard! Richard!

384
00:26:09,390 --> 00:26:10,695
What the hell happened to you?

385
00:26:10,795 --> 00:26:13,165
Cunningham and I--
a group of them surprised us.

386
00:26:13,265 --> 00:26:15,025
We were outnumbered, but I escaped.

387
00:26:15,125 --> 00:26:18,125
- Outnumbered, eh?
- Shut up, Ellie.

388
00:26:18,925 --> 00:26:19,925
Who's this?

389
00:26:20,025 --> 00:26:21,425
He's gonna help us take
care of our problem.

390
00:26:21,525 --> 00:26:22,552
You'd better get going.

391
00:26:22,702 --> 00:26:24,245
Wait. He's one of them.
You can't actually trust him.

392
00:26:24,395 --> 00:26:26,330
Yeah, you heard me, Ellie. Go.

393
00:26:26,530 --> 00:26:28,895
- How did you escape?
- I ran.

394
00:26:28,995 --> 00:26:31,095
And it never occurred to you
that they might follow you?

395
00:26:31,195 --> 00:26:33,565
Follow me?
Their leader is some sodding old man.

396
00:26:34,365 --> 00:26:36,430
What, you think he can track me?

397
00:26:37,130 --> 00:26:39,360
You think he knows this
island better than I do?

398
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:51,230
How did you know Richard would be here?

399
00:26:51,330 --> 00:26:53,360
Richard's always been here.

400
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:57,065
How old is he?

401
00:26:57,465 --> 00:26:58,925
Old.

402
00:26:59,025 --> 00:27:01,560
Why are you so interested
in Richard, John?

403
00:27:01,660 --> 00:27:03,095
I'm interested in him

404
00:27:03,195 --> 00:27:06,395
because he was about to
tell me how I could save us.

405
00:27:06,695 --> 00:27:07,760
"Save us"?

406
00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:09,095
Yeah.

407
00:27:09,495 --> 00:27:11,360
But before he could finish,

408
00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:13,595
we were interrupted by
that flash of light

409
00:27:14,295 --> 00:27:16,652
and I'm hoping we can
pick up where we left off.

410
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:19,645
I hate to bust up the
"I'm an Other, you're an Other" reunion,

411
00:27:19,795 --> 00:27:22,430
but Faraday, the guy that's
actually gonna save us,

412
00:27:22,530 --> 00:27:25,095
is being death marched
into the jungle right now.

413
00:27:25,195 --> 00:27:26,765
Good luck with that.

414
00:27:27,565 --> 00:27:29,430
You're not gonna help me save him?

415
00:27:29,530 --> 00:27:31,480
No. I'm gonna go down

416
00:27:31,580 --> 00:27:33,530
finish my conversation with Richard.

417
00:27:33,630 --> 00:27:35,795
That's gonna get us all killed.

418
00:27:35,895 --> 00:27:37,695
You go rolling in there,
they're gonna know we're here.

419
00:27:37,795 --> 00:27:40,260
Fair enough.
I'll give you ten minutes head start.

420
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:46,925
What about you?

421
00:27:47,725 --> 00:27:51,295
You wanna stay here in Crazytown
or help me rescue the geek?

422
00:27:52,995 --> 00:27:54,595
Why do you keep looking at me?

423
00:27:54,695 --> 00:27:55,960
No, no, I'm- I'm not. I--

424
00:27:56,060 --> 00:27:57,365
You are.

425
00:27:59,065 --> 00:28:01,425
You know what?
You're right. I'm--I'm sorry.

426
00:28:01,925 --> 00:28:03,595
It's just...

427
00:28:04,395 --> 00:28:08,325
You look so much like...

428
00:28:08,425 --> 00:28:09,725
someone I used to know.

429
00:28:09,825 --> 00:28:13,080
Someone other than the girl
you just professed your love for?

430
00:28:13,230 --> 00:28:17,030
- Well, aren't you the romeo.
- Far from it, believe me.

431
00:28:18,860 --> 00:28:21,130
I don't believe you, by the way.

432
00:28:22,030 --> 00:28:24,125
You may have Richard fooled,

433
00:28:24,325 --> 00:28:25,930
but you can't really
expect me to believe

434
00:28:26,030 --> 00:28:28,025
that you, a British
woman and a Chinese man

435
00:28:28,125 --> 00:28:31,495
are all members of the
United States military.

436
00:28:32,795 --> 00:28:33,860
Who are you,

437
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:36,000
and what are you doing on our island?

438
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:44,800
You wanna know who I am?

439
00:28:47,430 --> 00:28:50,440
I'm your best chance
at disarming that bomb.

440
00:28:53,390 --> 00:28:55,360
Right, then,

441
00:28:55,460 --> 00:28:57,330
disarm it.

442
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:36,030
What are you doing up there?

443
00:29:38,630 --> 00:29:40,260
I'm examining it.

444
00:30:01,230 --> 00:30:03,895
- Back up.
- What?

445
00:30:03,995 --> 00:30:05,695
Get back, get back.

446
00:30:05,795 --> 00:30:07,930
It's unsafe. We need to move.

447
00:30:08,530 --> 00:30:10,730
I swear, if you try anything...

448
00:30:10,830 --> 00:30:12,810
If I try anything...?
What, you're gonna--

449
00:30:12,925 --> 00:30:14,945
You're gonna shoot me?
Is that right?

450
00:30:15,095 --> 00:30:17,265
Yeah, that would be
perfect because, of course,

451
00:30:17,365 --> 00:30:20,595
rifle fire right next to-
What would you call this?

452
00:30:20,695 --> 00:30:23,435
Hydrogen bomb? Yes, fantastic idea.

453
00:30:23,535 --> 00:30:26,195
Really... Inspired.

454
00:30:27,295 --> 00:30:28,795
Okay, listen to me.

455
00:30:28,895 --> 00:30:31,295
Do you people have any
access to lead or concrete?

456
00:30:31,695 --> 00:30:32,795
For what?

457
00:30:32,895 --> 00:30:35,860
There's a crack in the casing.
It needs to be filled with lead.

458
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:39,365
You need to take it off
this platform carefully and bury it.

459
00:30:39,665 --> 00:30:42,410
You brought me all the way out here
to tell us that we have to bury it?

460
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:44,199
You told Alpert you
could disarm that thing.

461
00:30:44,299 --> 00:30:46,954
You don't need to worry.
You do what I say, you bury it,

462
00:30:47,055 --> 00:30:48,095
it won't go off.

463
00:30:48,195 --> 00:30:51,560
- How do you know that?
- I need you to trust me.

464
00:30:51,660 --> 00:30:52,900
I don't trust you.

465
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,710
Just bury it. Bury it,
and everything will be fine. Remember,

466
00:30:55,860 --> 00:30:57,088
- your superior ordered
me to take care of this.

467
00:30:57,188 --> 00:30:57,750
How can you be so sure?

468
00:30:57,850 --> 00:30:59,955
You wanna take care of
this bomb? You bury it!

469
00:31:00,055 --> 00:31:01,195
How do you know that?

470
00:31:01,295 --> 00:31:04,360
Because 50 years from now,
this island is still here!

471
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:06,925
There you...

472
00:31:07,825 --> 00:31:09,625
What did you just say?

473
00:31:09,825 --> 00:31:12,130
Whoa. Take it easy.

474
00:31:13,130 --> 00:31:14,995
I can explain myself a little better.

475
00:31:15,095 --> 00:31:16,960
I know how this sounds.
Believe me, it's...

476
00:31:17,060 --> 00:31:19,060
It's hard to explain.

477
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:22,195
50 years from now,
me and my...

478
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:24,525
Me and my friends--

479
00:31:24,625 --> 00:31:26,725
That's where we're from, okay?

480
00:31:26,825 --> 00:31:29,630
And here's the key - everything's fine.

481
00:31:29,930 --> 00:31:31,625
I'm not saying it's perfectly fine,

482
00:31:31,725 --> 00:31:35,195
but there hasn't been any
atomic blasts, all right?

483
00:31:35,795 --> 00:31:37,730
Drop the gun, blondie.

484
00:31:40,330 --> 00:31:41,630
It's okay.

485
00:31:41,730 --> 00:31:44,065
She's okay. You can put your gun down.

486
00:31:44,165 --> 00:31:45,760
She puts hers down first.

487
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:51,130
Why don't we all put our guns down?

488
00:31:53,660 --> 00:31:55,790
I said, drop it!

489
00:32:06,730 --> 00:32:08,590
Son of a bitch.

490
00:32:10,190 --> 00:32:12,330
Are they from the future, too?

491
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:16,100
You told her?

492
00:32:22,890 --> 00:32:24,990
Sir! Sir, you can't--

493
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:30,395
<i>Mr. Widmore.</i>

494
00:32:30,495 --> 00:32:32,895
I'm so sorry. He charged right past me.

495
00:32:32,995 --> 00:32:34,525
That's all right, Melanie.

496
00:32:34,625 --> 00:32:38,730
Mr. Hume is a... colleague of mine.

497
00:32:44,490 --> 00:32:46,460
Please leave us.

498
00:32:58,330 --> 00:33:00,425
I know you have questions for me.

499
00:33:00,525 --> 00:33:02,425
I'm not gonna answer them.

500
00:33:02,525 --> 00:33:04,595
I've come here to ask you something.

501
00:33:04,695 --> 00:33:07,165
And once you've told me
everything I need to know,

502
00:33:07,265 --> 00:33:09,260
you'll never see me again.

503
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:11,800
Understand?

504
00:33:14,230 --> 00:33:15,395
All right.

505
00:33:15,495 --> 00:33:18,460
I need to know where I can
find Daniel Faraday's mother.

506
00:33:21,630 --> 00:33:24,560
What makes you think I would
even know the answer to that?

507
00:33:24,660 --> 00:33:27,325
Because even before you put
Faraday on your little boat

508
00:33:27,425 --> 00:33:29,195
and sent him off to the island,

509
00:33:29,295 --> 00:33:32,495
you spent ten years
funding his research.

510
00:33:33,395 --> 00:33:36,395
So I figure, you must know something

511
00:33:36,795 --> 00:33:38,830
regarding his next of kin.

512
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:42,130
Desmond,

513
00:33:42,230 --> 00:33:45,495
I haven't seen or heard
from my daughter for three years.

514
00:33:46,095 --> 00:33:48,695
Just answer me this.

515
00:33:48,895 --> 00:33:51,030
Is she safe?

516
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:54,230
Where's Faraday's mother?

517
00:34:06,900 --> 00:34:09,660
She's in Los Angeles.

518
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:14,560
This is an address for her.

519
00:34:17,430 --> 00:34:19,895
I suspect she won't be
pleased to see you.

520
00:34:20,495 --> 00:34:22,760
She's a very private person.

521
00:34:36,830 --> 00:34:38,330
Wait, Desmond.

522
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:48,095
Deliver your message...

523
00:34:48,195 --> 00:34:50,795
but then get out of this mess.

524
00:34:50,895 --> 00:34:53,165
Don't put Penny's life in danger.

525
00:34:53,265 --> 00:34:54,595
Danger?

526
00:34:54,695 --> 00:34:56,265
You're getting yourself
involved in something

527
00:34:56,365 --> 00:34:58,165
that goes back many, many years.

528
00:34:58,265 --> 00:35:00,730
It has nothing to do
with you or my daughter.

529
00:35:01,430 --> 00:35:03,565
Wherever you were hiding...

530
00:35:04,165 --> 00:35:06,060
Go back there.

531
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:10,230
Thanks for the advice.

532
00:35:21,730 --> 00:35:23,660
Richard Alpert!

533
00:35:25,919 --> 00:35:26,719
Hey!

534
00:35:26,830 --> 00:35:29,265
- I'm looking for Richard.
- Don't move.

535
00:35:29,365 --> 00:35:31,365
- Richard Alpert!
- On the ground, now.

536
00:35:31,665 --> 00:35:33,955
- Richard, I need to talk to you!
- Shut your mouth!

537
00:35:34,055 --> 00:35:35,530
That's enough!

538
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:48,630
Who are you?

539
00:35:52,300 --> 00:35:54,630
My name is John Locke.

540
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:58,230
Is that supposed to
mean something to me?

541
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:06,000
Jacob sent me.

542
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:17,195
Put the gun down.

543
00:36:17,395 --> 00:36:18,895
What?

544
00:36:19,495 --> 00:36:21,530
Richard, you can't seriously trust him.

545
00:36:23,830 --> 00:36:27,300
I said... Put the gun down, Widmore.

546
00:36:31,660 --> 00:36:33,830
Your name is Widmore?

547
00:36:35,130 --> 00:36:37,230
Charles Widmore?

548
00:36:38,530 --> 00:36:40,230
What's it to you?

549
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:46,030
Nothing. Nice to meet you.

550
00:36:50,140 --> 00:36:52,705
<i>...but it saw the bear
so that it ran away again.</i>

551
00:36:53,805 --> 00:36:55,300
Where?

552
00:36:59,562 --> 00:37:02,362
- Hi.
- Hi.

553
00:37:11,470 --> 00:37:12,670
Good day?

554
00:37:12,770 --> 00:37:14,205
Yeah.

555
00:37:14,405 --> 00:37:16,735
He wanted to go fishing in the Thames.

556
00:37:17,435 --> 00:37:19,105
We were unsuccessful.

557
00:37:19,705 --> 00:37:21,335
And you?

558
00:37:21,435 --> 00:37:23,305
Did you find Faraday's mum?

559
00:37:23,805 --> 00:37:25,770
There was no one to find.

560
00:37:26,370 --> 00:37:28,225
She, um...

561
00:37:30,575 --> 00:37:32,600
She died a few years ago.

562
00:37:37,870 --> 00:37:39,905
Why are you lying to me?

563
00:37:41,105 --> 00:37:42,705
What? I'm not.

564
00:37:42,805 --> 00:37:44,400
Where is she?

565
00:37:51,370 --> 00:37:53,340
She's in Los Angeles.

566
00:37:55,700 --> 00:37:58,170
Look, Pen, you've got
nothing to worry about.

567
00:37:58,270 --> 00:37:59,870
You know, this was a mistake.

568
00:38:00,470 --> 00:38:02,960
No, I... I made a promise
that this would be done in a day

569
00:38:03,060 --> 00:38:06,135
and now it's done.
It's not our problem anymore.

570
00:38:06,835 --> 00:38:09,765
And what happens if you wake up
tomorrow and remember something else?

571
00:38:09,865 --> 00:38:10,835
Then I'll forget it.

572
00:38:10,935 --> 00:38:12,335
- And the next day?
- I'll forget it.

573
00:38:12,435 --> 00:38:13,805
It doesn't matter, Pen.

574
00:38:14,605 --> 00:38:17,170
You're my life now, you and Charlie.

575
00:38:21,970 --> 00:38:23,940
I won't leave you again...

576
00:38:26,140 --> 00:38:27,840
Not for this...

577
00:38:29,570 --> 00:38:31,400
Not for anything.

578
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:49,500
You'll never forget it, Des.

579
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:54,040
So I guess we're going with you.

580
00:39:11,300 --> 00:39:12,735
I gave you this?

581
00:39:14,035 --> 00:39:16,395
- Yes.
- After you were shot in the leg

582
00:39:16,505 --> 00:39:18,905
and I... wandered out of
the jungle to patch you up?

583
00:39:19,005 --> 00:39:20,370
That's right.

584
00:39:20,670 --> 00:39:24,105
And why don't I remember...
well, any of this?

585
00:39:24,205 --> 00:39:26,300
Because it hasn't happened yet.

586
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:31,370
I'm not sure what you're
expecting me to say, John Locke.

587
00:39:31,470 --> 00:39:33,610
I expect you to tell me
how to get off the island.

588
00:39:33,710 --> 00:39:36,347
That's very privileged information.
Why would I share it with you?

589
00:39:36,447 --> 00:39:39,420
Because you told me that
I had something very important to do,

590
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:41,035
once I get there.

591
00:39:43,535 --> 00:39:45,705
And because I'm your leader.

592
00:39:46,505 --> 00:39:49,035
- You're my leader?
- That's what you told me.

593
00:39:49,135 --> 00:39:51,805
Look, I... certainly don't
want to contradict myself,

594
00:39:51,905 --> 00:39:56,282
but... we have a very specific process
for selecting our leadership,

595
00:39:56,383 --> 00:39:58,655
and it starts at a very, very young age.

596
00:39:59,005 --> 00:40:02,505
All right. All right.

597
00:40:03,305 --> 00:40:05,105
What year is it right now?

598
00:40:06,205 --> 00:40:08,470
It's 1954.

599
00:40:10,670 --> 00:40:13,270
All right. May 30, 1956,
two years from now,

600
00:40:13,570 --> 00:40:15,135
that's the day I'm born.

601
00:40:15,235 --> 00:40:18,135
Tustin, California,
and if you don't believe me,

602
00:40:18,235 --> 00:40:20,635
I suggest you come and visit me.

603
00:40:23,535 --> 00:40:24,505
Oh, no.

604
00:40:24,605 --> 00:40:27,805
- What's wrong?
- It's about to happen again.

605
00:40:29,805 --> 00:40:31,235
You need to tell me now, Richard.

606
00:40:31,335 --> 00:40:34,970
How do I get off the island?
Please! Tell me!

607
00:40:57,320 --> 00:40:58,920
You all right?

608
00:40:59,350 --> 00:41:00,450
Yeah...

609
00:41:00,740 --> 00:41:01,970
I think so.

610
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:04,180
Charlotte.

611
00:41:09,220 --> 00:41:10,115
You okay?

612
00:41:10,215 --> 00:41:11,710
Yeah, I'm fine.

613
00:41:12,870 --> 00:41:14,280
Yeah, me too.

614
00:41:14,390 --> 00:41:15,790
I'm great too.

615
00:41:29,210 --> 00:41:30,410
Charlotte.

616
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:31,660
Charlotte...

617
00:41:31,930 --> 00:41:33,335
Charlotte. No, no, no.

618
00:41:33,435 --> 00:41:35,000
Look at me, hey, look at me! It's okay.

619
00:41:35,130 --> 00:41:36,360
It's okay.

620
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:38,540
Charlotte!

621
