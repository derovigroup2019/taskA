1
00:00:00,002 --> 00:00:02,100
Previously on "Lost"

2
00:00:03,134 --> 00:00:07,234
Ladies and gentlemen,
the survivors of Oceanic 815.

3
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:12,100
I just killed a man
who's been perched...

4
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:14,701
outside this facility
for the last week.

5
00:00:14,801 --> 00:00:16,376
I want you to come with me
somewhere safe.

6
00:00:16,876 --> 00:00:18,617
You and I have common interests.

7
00:00:18,667 --> 00:00:21,277
We're not the only ones
who left the island.

8
00:00:21,667 --> 00:00:25,657
- We... were not supposed to leave.
- Bye, Jack.

9
00:00:25,801 --> 00:00:27,433
We have to go back, Kate.

10
00:00:27,533 --> 00:00:29,900
Hello, Jack. Did he tell you
that I was off the island?

11
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:33,084
Yes, he did. he said
that I had to come back.

12
00:00:33,484 --> 00:00:36,167
We're gonna have to bring him, too.

13
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:56,166
Ah. Hm. Baby's awake.

14
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:00,033
It's your turn.

15
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:00,734
Morning. Here you go, doc.

16
00:02:00,834 --> 00:02:02,767
I don't need a script.

17
00:02:04,367 --> 00:02:06,301
Let's go. I don't have all day.

18
00:02:07,767 --> 00:02:09,134
- Speed.
- Okay.

19
00:02:09,234 --> 00:02:11,700
Dharma orientation film number two,

20
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:13,833
take one.

21
00:02:17,401 --> 00:02:20,034
And... action.

22
00:02:20,134 --> 00:02:22,600
Hello. I'm Dr. Marvin Candle,

23
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:25,367
and this is the orientation
film for station two,

24
00:02:25,467 --> 00:02:26,700
The Arrow.

25
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:29,467
Given your specific area of expertise,

26
00:02:29,567 --> 00:02:31,467
you should find it no surprise

27
00:02:31,567 --> 00:02:33,333
that this station's primary purpose

28
00:02:33,433 --> 00:02:35,467
is to develop defensive strategies

29
00:02:35,567 --> 00:02:37,101
and gather intelligence

30
00:02:37,201 --> 00:02:39,300
on the island's hostile
indigenous population--

31
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:40,901
Dr. Chang!

32
00:02:41,001 --> 00:02:42,734
- Dr. Chang?
- Damn it! What the hell?!

33
00:02:42,834 --> 00:02:43,834
- Cut!

34
00:02:43,934 --> 00:02:45,233
Sir, we got a problem
down at The Orchid.

35
00:03:07,634 --> 00:03:09,234
Over here.

36
00:03:09,334 --> 00:03:12,234
We were cutting through the
rock, right on your specs.

37
00:03:12,334 --> 00:03:14,301
That's when the drill melted.

38
00:03:14,401 --> 00:03:16,267
- The drill melted?
- Yeah, yeah.

39
00:03:16,367 --> 00:03:18,234
3 meters from the margin
line on the plans.

40
00:03:18,334 --> 00:03:20,100
We went through six carbon drill bits,

41
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,701
and the last one just
fried. Then my operator--

42
00:03:21,801 --> 00:03:23,734
My operator starts grabbing
his head and freaking out.

43
00:03:28,667 --> 00:03:30,367
We sonar-imaged the wall.

44
00:03:30,467 --> 00:03:33,467
There's an open chamber
about 20 meters in,

45
00:03:33,567 --> 00:03:36,067
behind the rock.

46
00:03:36,167 --> 00:03:38,933
There's something in there.

47
00:03:39,033 --> 00:03:41,634
And the only way to get to it

48
00:03:41,734 --> 00:03:43,800
is to lay charges here and here

49
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:46,533
- and blast through it and take a look.
- Under no circumstances.

50
00:03:46,867 --> 00:03:50,667
This station is being built
here because of its proximity

51
00:03:51,067 --> 00:03:53,500
to what we believe to be an
almost limitless energy.

52
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,967
And that energy, once we
can harness it correctly,

53
00:03:56,067 --> 00:03:59,301
it's going to allow us
to manipulate time.

54
00:03:59,401 --> 00:04:00,767
Right.

55
00:04:02,267 --> 00:04:05,001
Okay, so what? We're gonna
go back and kill Hitler?

56
00:04:05,101 --> 00:04:06,667
Don't be absurd.

57
00:04:06,767 --> 00:04:08,600
There are rules,

58
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:10,867
rules that can't be broken.

59
00:04:13,233 --> 00:04:15,167
So what do you want me to do?

60
00:04:15,267 --> 00:04:16,801
You're gonna do nothing.

61
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:19,933
If you drill even 1 centimeter further,

62
00:04:20,033 --> 00:04:22,233
you risk releasing that energy.

63
00:04:22,333 --> 00:04:24,233
If that's gonna happen,

64
00:04:27,367 --> 00:04:29,634
God help us all.

65
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:36,067
All right, get him up. Let's go.

66
00:04:36,567 --> 00:04:37,900
Watch yourself!

67
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,434
Sorry, sir. It won't happen again.

68
00:04:42,933 --> 00:04:45,300
All right. I'll grab
the rest of his stuff.

69
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:47,700
Let's go.

70
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:55,034
Did you hear that?

71
00:04:55,134 --> 00:04:58,600
Time travel. How stupid
does that guy think we are?

72
00:05:01,767 --> 00:05:03,767
<i>Let's go, guys.</i>

73
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,800
Why don't you close that up now, Jack?

74
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:35,266
Come on.

75
00:05:35,366 --> 00:05:38,266
Let's get him in the van.
It's out back.

76
00:05:38,566 --> 00:05:39,933
Where are we taking him?

77
00:05:40,033 --> 00:05:42,300
We'll worry about that
once we pick up Hugo.

78
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:45,733
Hurley...

79
00:05:45,833 --> 00:05:48,966
is locked away in a mental institution.

80
00:05:49,066 --> 00:05:50,933
Which should make recruiting him

81
00:05:51,033 --> 00:05:53,300
considerably easier than
the rest of your friends.

82
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:55,933
They're not my friends anymore.

83
00:05:56,033 --> 00:05:58,467
Oh, that's the spirit.

84
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:03,033
How did we get here?

85
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:07,799
How did all this happen?

86
00:06:09,899 --> 00:06:12,699
It happened because you left, Jack.

87
00:06:15,933 --> 00:06:18,233
Now let's get started, shall we?

88
00:06:29,766 --> 00:06:32,533
So once we get Hurley... then what?

89
00:06:32,632 --> 00:06:36,200
Then we get Sun, Sayid...

90
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:37,866
and Kate, of course.

91
00:06:37,966 --> 00:06:40,699
I don't see that happening.

92
00:06:47,566 --> 00:06:50,400
When was the last time you saw him?

93
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:53,067
I mean, Locke.

94
00:06:55,366 --> 00:06:57,567
On the island...

95
00:06:59,367 --> 00:07:02,500
In the Orchid station
below the greenhouse.

96
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:04,600
I told him I was sorry

97
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:07,133
for making his life so miserable,

98
00:07:07,233 --> 00:07:08,833
and then he left.

99
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:17,400
So obviously John's visit
to you made an impression.

100
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:19,733
What did he say to make
you such a believer?

101
00:07:24,367 --> 00:07:26,100
Sawyer, Juliet,

102
00:07:27,233 --> 00:07:30,966
everyone from the boat...
and everyone we left behind--

103
00:07:31,066 --> 00:07:35,600
John said that they'd die,
too, if I didn't come back.

104
00:07:38,266 --> 00:07:41,434
Did he tell you what happened
to them after the island moved?

105
00:07:43,333 --> 00:07:45,566
No.

106
00:07:45,666 --> 00:07:47,266
No, he didn't.

107
00:07:49,299 --> 00:07:51,233
Then I guess we'll never know.

108
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:54,267
What the...

109
00:08:55,933 --> 00:08:57,033
Richard...

110
00:08:58,733 --> 00:09:00,400
Richard?

111
00:09:02,466 --> 00:09:03,700
Anyone?

112
00:09:07,967 --> 00:09:10,433
Anyone?

113
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:15,866
What happened?

114
00:09:16,966 --> 00:09:19,100
What was that light?

115
00:09:21,233 --> 00:09:23,767
We must've been inside the radius.

116
00:09:31,833 --> 00:09:33,797
What the hell was that?

117
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:35,800
I don't know.

118
00:09:41,134 --> 00:09:43,434
Where's the freighter?

119
00:09:47,367 --> 00:09:49,200
- Maybe it went down.
- Unh-unh. No way.

120
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:51,300
A minute ago, that boat
was coughing black smoke.

121
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:53,467
Now there's just nothin'?

122
00:09:54,367 --> 00:09:56,233
What about the helicopter?

123
00:09:57,966 --> 00:10:00,133
It was heading for that boat.

124
00:10:02,667 --> 00:10:04,366
Rose!

125
00:10:04,466 --> 00:10:06,034
Rose!

126
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:09,333
- Bernard!
- Rose!

127
00:10:10,767 --> 00:10:13,282
- Have you seen Rose?!
- No.

128
00:10:13,382 --> 00:10:15,700
Oh, my God!

129
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:17,734
- Bernard!
- Rose!

130
00:10:17,833 --> 00:10:20,866
- Where were you?
- I was over... by the church.

131
00:10:20,966 --> 00:10:22,636
What was that sound?
What was that light?

132
00:10:22,736 --> 00:10:23,510
I don't know.

133
00:10:23,610 --> 00:10:25,433
Just calm down. There's no
need to panic, all right?

134
00:10:25,532 --> 00:10:27,500
- We'll just go back to camp and...
- Calm down?

135
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:30,766
No need to panic?
We can't go back to the camp.

136
00:10:30,966 --> 00:10:33,400
- What the hell are you talking about?
- There is no camp.

137
00:10:38,834 --> 00:10:41,733
The--the sky lit up, a-and then this.

138
00:10:41,833 --> 00:10:45,800
The--the kitchen? Gone.

139
00:10:46,966 --> 00:10:50,749
And--and all the tents, all
the food and water... gone.

140
00:10:50,849 --> 00:10:53,633
Well, everything but us. All of it.

141
00:10:53,733 --> 00:10:55,034
It's gone.

142
00:10:55,134 --> 00:10:58,400
It's not gone.

143
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:01,900
Daniel!

144
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:03,967
Hey.

145
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:05,666
I thought you were on the freighter.

146
00:11:05,766 --> 00:11:07,099
No, we never made it.

147
00:11:07,199 --> 00:11:08,722
We were on our way out
there when it happened.

148
00:11:08,822 --> 00:11:10,166
What do you mean, the camp's not gone?

149
00:11:11,266 --> 00:11:14,330
- Who the hell are you anyway?
- That's Dan.

150
00:11:14,433 --> 00:11:16,733
- He's our physicist.
- Listen, we have no time.

151
00:11:17,233 --> 00:11:18,767
I need you to take me
to something man-made,

152
00:11:18,867 --> 00:11:22,000
something that was built,
any kind of a landmark.

153
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:25,000
There's a Dharma station
15 minutes from here.

154
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:27,500
You mean the hatch? The one we blew up?

155
00:11:27,599 --> 00:11:29,000
That's perfect.

156
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:31,834
We should get moving before
it happens again, okay?

157
00:11:31,934 --> 00:11:33,800
Before what happens again?

158
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:37,966
And why is our camp gone?

159
00:11:38,666 --> 00:11:41,633
Your camp isn't gone.

160
00:11:41,733 --> 00:11:44,133
It hasn't been built yet.

161
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:18,283
Choo choo! Tunnel!

162
00:12:18,883 --> 00:12:22,066
Oh, I think Choo Choo
knows better than that.

163
00:12:23,166 --> 00:12:25,600
He goes into that tunnel,
he's never coming back out.

164
00:12:29,967 --> 00:12:31,966
Watch your cartoons, Goober.

165
00:12:32,066 --> 00:12:34,100
Mommy'll be right back.

166
00:12:38,433 --> 00:12:40,567
- Ms. Austen?
- Yes?

167
00:12:40,667 --> 00:12:44,133
Hi, I'm Dan Norton of the
law firm Agostoni & Norton.

168
00:12:44,233 --> 00:12:47,100
- May we have a moment of your time?
- And who are you?

169
00:12:47,199 --> 00:12:48,700
He's my associate.

170
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,966
If I could just come in,
I'll be glad to explain--

171
00:12:51,066 --> 00:12:52,866
No, you can explain right here.

172
00:12:53,066 --> 00:12:54,867
Okay, you got it.

173
00:12:54,966 --> 00:12:58,500
Ms. Austen, we're here to
get a blood sample from you

174
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:01,200
and one from your son Aaron.

175
00:13:02,499 --> 00:13:03,299
Excuse me?

176
00:13:03,399 --> 00:13:05,767
Now I have a court
order signed by a judge

177
00:13:05,867 --> 00:13:08,800
for you to relinquish your blood
upon being served these papers

178
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:09,900
Why?

179
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,300
To determine your
relationship to the child.

180
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:16,967
I'm sorry. I don't understand.
Um, who's the--

181
00:13:17,067 --> 00:13:20,599
I'm not at liberty to divulge
the identity of my client.

182
00:13:20,699 --> 00:13:22,533
- Your client?
- Please, may we come in?

183
00:13:22,633 --> 00:13:23,991
Get off my property.

184
00:13:24,741 --> 00:13:26,800
If you won't comply,

185
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:29,400
then I'm going to have to
come back with the sheriff.

186
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:32,467
Then come back with the sheriff.

187
00:14:07,367 --> 00:14:09,966
Where are you going, mommy?

188
00:14:12,467 --> 00:14:14,700
We're going on vacation, baby.

189
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:31,634
Say bye-bye, baby.

190
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:42,634
Why did you jump off that helicopter?

191
00:14:42,733 --> 00:14:45,133
I told you. We were runnin' out of gas.

192
00:14:45,233 --> 00:14:47,400
I wanted to make sure she--

193
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:50,833
I wanted to make sure they
got back to the boat.

194
00:14:50,933 --> 00:14:53,234
- Don't matter now anyway, does it?
- Excuse me.

195
00:14:53,334 --> 00:14:56,200
I really need the two of you
to pick up the pace. Okay, thanks.

196
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:58,167
First things first.

197
00:14:58,267 --> 00:15:00,467
Give me your shirt.

198
00:15:01,866 --> 00:15:03,900
- My shirt?
- Yeah.

199
00:15:03,999 --> 00:15:07,782
I really think we have
far more pressing matters

200
00:15:07,882 --> 00:15:09,766
than me giving you a shirt.

201
00:15:09,866 --> 00:15:13,433
- How about we just keep moving, okay?
- How about we call a time-out

202
00:15:13,533 --> 00:15:15,614
so you can tell us
what the hell is going on?

203
00:15:15,714 --> 00:15:16,934
How about you trust me?

204
00:15:16,991 --> 00:15:17,763
Trust you? I don't know you!

205
00:15:17,863 --> 00:15:19,833
We really do not have time
for me to try to explain.

206
00:15:19,933 --> 00:15:21,366
You have no idea

207
00:15:21,466 --> 00:15:24,333
how difficult that would be
for me to try to explain this--

208
00:15:24,433 --> 00:15:26,433
this phenomenon to a quantum physicist.

209
00:15:26,533 --> 00:15:28,266
That would be difficult,

210
00:15:28,366 --> 00:15:30,400
so for me to try to explain
whatever is happening--

211
00:15:31,099 --> 00:15:33,033
Oi!

212
00:15:33,133 --> 00:15:35,100
What in bloody hell do
you think you're doing?

213
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:37,834
Shut it, Ginger, or you're get one too.

214
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:42,700
Now talk.

215
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:45,866
The island...

216
00:15:45,966 --> 00:15:47,400
Think of the island

217
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:49,900
like a record spinning on a turntable...

218
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,050
only now that record is skipping.

219
00:15:54,050 --> 00:15:58,101
Whatever Ben Linus did down
at the Orchid station...

220
00:15:59,301 --> 00:16:02,233
I think it may have...

221
00:16:02,533 --> 00:16:04,066
dislodged us.

222
00:16:04,166 --> 00:16:06,600
Dislodged us from what?

223
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:08,500
Time.

224
00:16:12,167 --> 00:16:14,134
So that's why our camp is gone?

225
00:16:14,233 --> 00:16:16,368
Because the island is
moving through time?

226
00:16:16,467 --> 00:16:18,900
Yeah, either the island is, or we are.

227
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,566
What?

228
00:16:20,666 --> 00:16:22,600
And it's just as likely
that we're moving,

229
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:24,766
your people and us.

230
00:16:25,666 --> 00:16:29,334
And everyone in your group--
you're all accounted for, right?

231
00:16:33,501 --> 00:16:34,967
Not everyone.

232
00:16:39,667 --> 00:16:41,267
Locke.

233
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:13,867
Is anyone there?!

234
00:18:17,533 --> 00:18:18,967
Hello?!

235
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:24,133
Hello?!

236
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:55,867
Hey!

237
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:58,567
Uhh!

238
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:18,200
Who are you?

239
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,033
- Well, listen, listen...
- How many others are on board?

240
00:19:24,134 --> 00:19:26,766
You don't understand.
I didn't come on that plane.

241
00:19:27,966 --> 00:19:28,966
Wrong answer.

242
00:19:29,067 --> 00:19:30,433
No, wait! Stop! Stop!

243
00:19:30,533 --> 00:19:32,967
I know you. I know who you are.

244
00:19:33,067 --> 00:19:35,134
Your name...

245
00:19:35,234 --> 00:19:37,267
Your name is Ethan.

246
00:19:38,367 --> 00:19:42,000
- Your name is Ethan.
- Who are you?

247
00:19:42,101 --> 00:19:43,967
My name is John Locke.

248
00:19:44,067 --> 00:19:46,433
I know this is gonna
be hard to understand,

249
00:19:46,533 --> 00:19:51,500
but Ben Linus appointed
me as your leader.

250
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:55,800
That is the most ridiculous
thing I've ever heard.

251
00:19:57,267 --> 00:20:00,301
Good-bye, John Locke.

252
00:20:22,467 --> 00:20:24,401
Great.

253
00:20:33,134 --> 00:20:35,766
So when are we now, wiz kid?

254
00:20:35,867 --> 00:20:37,933
We're either in the past...

255
00:20:40,467 --> 00:20:43,800
or we're in the future.

256
00:20:44,134 --> 00:20:46,500
<i>Flight 23 to Paris</i>

257
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:48,500
<i>will begin boarding at gate 15.</i>

258
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:50,500
<i>Please have your boarding passes ready.</i>

259
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:03,767
Evening, ma'am.
Where you flying to tonight?

260
00:21:03,867 --> 00:21:05,299
Los Angeles.

261
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:08,867
Of course. May I see
your passport, please?

262
00:21:16,667 --> 00:21:19,034
Excuse me.

263
00:21:19,134 --> 00:21:22,266
Could you wait here for
just one moment, Ms. Kwon?

264
00:21:32,934 --> 00:21:35,967
Hey! Where are you going?

265
00:21:36,067 --> 00:21:37,967
Open this door.

266
00:21:38,067 --> 00:21:39,600
Open this door!

267
00:21:39,701 --> 00:21:41,600
Save your breath.

268
00:21:42,201 --> 00:21:44,833
They only do what I tell them to do.

269
00:21:45,533 --> 00:21:46,800
You.

270
00:21:48,867 --> 00:21:51,533
You had me brought in here?

271
00:21:52,034 --> 00:21:52,966
Why?

272
00:21:53,267 --> 00:21:55,000
You had the audacity

273
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:56,966
to approach me in broad daylight

274
00:21:57,067 --> 00:22:00,966
in front of my business
associates... in public.

275
00:22:01,067 --> 00:22:03,300
Why did I have you brought here?

276
00:22:03,401 --> 00:22:06,633
Because you showed me no respect.

277
00:22:06,733 --> 00:22:08,600
I will be respected, Sun.

278
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:11,067
Fair enough.

279
00:22:15,367 --> 00:22:17,800
Since you seem to be
worried about your plane,

280
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:19,733
I'll get right down to business.

281
00:22:19,833 --> 00:22:22,467
You mentioned that you and I had...

282
00:22:22,568 --> 00:22:24,800
common interests.

283
00:22:28,567 --> 00:22:31,666
Why don't you tell me
exactly what they might be?

284
00:22:33,601 --> 00:22:36,300
To kill Benjamin Linus.

285
00:22:42,567 --> 00:22:44,166
<i>The victim was found shot in his car</i>

286
00:22:44,267 --> 00:22:46,000
<i>on the grounds of the
Santa Rosa hospital,</i>

287
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:48,547
<i>a private mental health care
facility outside Los Angeles.</i>

288
00:22:48,605 --> 00:22:49,405
Okay...

289
00:22:49,847 --> 00:22:50,467
Let's go get him.

290
00:22:50,567 --> 00:22:53,200
<i>Police have now identified
their suspect in the shooting</i>

291
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:55,167
<i>as a patient at the hospital</i>

292
00:22:55,267 --> 00:22:57,600
<i>who escaped earlier this
evening - Hugo Reyes.</i>

293
00:22:57,700 --> 00:23:00,366
<i>Now if that name sounds familiar to you,</i>

294
00:23:00,467 --> 00:23:04,100
<i>that's because Reyes was a member
of the infamous Oceanic Six.</i>

295
00:23:04,901 --> 00:23:07,233
<i>As to why he may have murdered
a visitor to the facility</i>

296
00:23:07,333 --> 00:23:09,100
<i>where Reyes lived for two years,</i>

297
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:11,900
<i>that remains a complete mystery.</i>

298
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:14,599
Well...

299
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:18,633
Looks like we have a change of plan.

300
00:23:27,299 --> 00:23:29,566
Here she comes, right now.

301
00:23:30,667 --> 00:23:32,132
Here's your order, sir.

302
00:23:33,566 --> 00:23:35,499
- Keep the change.
- Thank you.

303
00:23:37,666 --> 00:23:39,232
Awesome.

304
00:23:39,333 --> 00:23:41,466
- You want a fry?
- No, thank you.

305
00:23:41,967 --> 00:23:43,833
You know, maybe if you
ate more comfort food,

306
00:23:43,933 --> 00:23:46,700
you wouldn't have to go
around shooting people.

307
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:04,600
So that dude you popped
outside Santa Rosa - who was he?

308
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:08,066
I don't care. He was armed
and he was watching you.

309
00:24:08,167 --> 00:24:10,066
That made him an enemy.

310
00:24:10,367 --> 00:24:12,400
Do you think he was gonna kill me?

311
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:14,866
I'm not taking any risks
after Bentham died--

312
00:24:14,966 --> 00:24:17,766
- You mean Locke.
- Yes, I mean Locke.

313
00:24:17,866 --> 00:24:20,132
I need a cool code name.

314
00:24:25,467 --> 00:24:27,233
So when'd you become so paranoid?

315
00:24:27,334 --> 00:24:29,033
If you'd spent the last two years

316
00:24:29,134 --> 00:24:31,000
doing the things I was doing,

317
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:33,100
you'd be paranoid, too.

318
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:35,032
Oh, yeah?

319
00:24:35,133 --> 00:24:36,500
Paranoid? Like what?

320
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:39,333
What kind of things?

321
00:24:39,433 --> 00:24:42,299
I was working for Benjamin Linus.

322
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:45,066
Wait. He's on our side now?

323
00:24:45,566 --> 00:24:48,966
Listen to me, Hurley.

324
00:24:49,066 --> 00:24:52,266
If you ever have the misfortune
of running into him,

325
00:24:52,367 --> 00:24:56,033
whatever he tells you,
just do the opposite.

326
00:25:05,533 --> 00:25:07,333
Wait here.

327
00:26:00,633 --> 00:26:02,832
- Is he all right?
- I don't know.

328
00:26:02,933 --> 00:26:04,942
Is he breathing or what?
Who is that?

329
00:26:05,043 --> 00:26:06,299
Check him out.

330
00:26:07,799 --> 00:26:11,900
Look out! That guy's got a gun! Run!
Get out of here! Call the cops!

331
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:14,433
Hurry!

332
00:26:21,233 --> 00:26:22,933
Sayid!

333
00:26:24,632 --> 00:26:26,166
You okay?

334
00:26:26,467 --> 00:26:28,500
Get me to the car.

335
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:30,999
Dude. Dude...

336
00:26:31,100 --> 00:26:32,500
Oh, man.

337
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:34,999
I thought it was supposed
to be a safe house.

338
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:36,933
I never should've left that island.

339
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:57,767
Hey, do you think he's looking for us?

340
00:26:57,867 --> 00:26:58,933
Who?

341
00:26:59,033 --> 00:27:00,700
Widmore.

342
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:04,999
It took him, like, 20 years to
find this place the first time.

343
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:06,966
I'll start holding my breath now.

344
00:27:07,066 --> 00:27:08,834
Over here!

345
00:27:20,467 --> 00:27:23,066
- Is this the hatch?
- It was.

346
00:27:23,166 --> 00:27:26,800
Blown up, just like we left it.

347
00:27:26,901 --> 00:27:28,700
Okay.

348
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:30,800
So when we are now...

349
00:27:30,901 --> 00:27:34,999
It's now after you and your
people crashed on the island.

350
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:37,744
You sayin' our camp is back
on the beach again?

351
00:27:37,844 --> 00:27:38,966
It's possible, yeah.

352
00:27:39,066 --> 00:27:41,867
- Good. I'm going back.
- Hey. No, no.

353
00:27:42,167 --> 00:27:42,767
It's pointless.

354
00:27:42,867 --> 00:27:45,032
More pointless than staring
at a hole in the ground?

355
00:27:45,132 --> 00:27:46,866
We don't know when the
next flash is coming.

356
00:27:46,966 --> 00:27:48,566
By the time you get back to the beach,

357
00:27:48,666 --> 00:27:49,970
the camp could be gone again.

358
00:27:50,070 --> 00:27:51,132
Yeah, but what if it ain't?

359
00:27:51,232 --> 00:27:53,566
Hell, what if the helicopter
hasn't even taken off yet?

360
00:27:54,167 --> 00:27:55,633
We could warn them,

361
00:27:55,734 --> 00:27:57,900
stop them from ever flying to that boat.

362
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:00,899
That's not the way it works.

363
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,100
Who says?

364
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:04,899
You cannot change anything. You can't.

365
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,333
Even if you tried to, it wouldn't work.

366
00:28:07,434 --> 00:28:09,300
Why not?

367
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:11,966
Time--it's like a street, all right?

368
00:28:12,067 --> 00:28:14,399
We can move forward on that
street, we can move in reverse,

369
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:17,533
but we cannot ever create a new street.

370
00:28:17,833 --> 00:28:20,433
If we try to do anything different,

371
00:28:20,533 --> 00:28:22,433
we will fail every time.

372
00:28:22,833 --> 00:28:25,599
Whatever happened, happened.

373
00:28:28,599 --> 00:28:32,267
How do you know so much
about this, Danny boy?

374
00:28:36,333 --> 00:28:39,766
I know about this because...

375
00:28:39,866 --> 00:28:43,199
I've spent my entire adult
life studying space-time.

376
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:44,866
I know all of this because

377
00:28:44,967 --> 00:28:47,066
this journal contains
everything I've ever learned

378
00:28:47,166 --> 00:28:48,633
about the Dharma Initiative.

379
00:28:48,834 --> 00:28:51,700
This is why I'm here.

380
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:55,466
I know what's happening.

381
00:28:56,066 --> 00:28:58,233
So how can we stop it?

382
00:28:58,333 --> 00:29:00,834
We can't stop it.

383
00:29:02,300 --> 00:29:03,934
Then who can?

384
00:30:59,067 --> 00:31:01,100
Richard?

385
00:31:01,201 --> 00:31:02,899
Hey, John.

386
00:31:08,066 --> 00:31:09,500
Richard...

387
00:31:09,900 --> 00:31:11,166
What is happening?

388
00:31:11,267 --> 00:31:14,166
What's happening is that
you're bleeding to death.

389
00:31:15,266 --> 00:31:16,933
Here.

390
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:22,833
I need to get the bullet out.

391
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:28,499
How did you know there was
a bullet in my leg, Richard?

392
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:30,233
Because you told me there was, John.

393
00:31:30,334 --> 00:31:32,633
No, no. No, I didn't.

394
00:31:33,733 --> 00:31:36,133
Well... you will.

395
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,167
It was Ethan who shot me.

396
00:31:39,266 --> 00:31:40,066
Well...

397
00:31:40,666 --> 00:31:42,466
What comes around, goes around.

398
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,599
When am I?

399
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:51,000
Well, John, that-- that's all relative.

400
00:31:53,933 --> 00:31:55,400
Wait, wait.

401
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:58,900
The- the noise, when the sky
lit up... where did you go?

402
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,233
I didn't go anywhere, John. You went.

403
00:32:01,334 --> 00:32:03,100
All right, this- this is gonna hurt.

404
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:06,700
It'll be a lot worse if
you move, okay? Hold still.

405
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:17,133
All done.

406
00:32:17,233 --> 00:32:18,933
Jeez.

407
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:24,200
I don't understand.

408
00:32:24,300 --> 00:32:25,966
How- how did you know that I was here?

409
00:32:26,066 --> 00:32:29,550
- How did you know where to find me?
- I wish I had time to explain it, John.

410
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:31,233
But you're gonna be moving on soon,

411
00:32:31,333 --> 00:32:33,026
and we need to go over a couple of
things before you do.

412
00:32:33,126 --> 00:32:34,200
"Moving on"? God!

413
00:32:34,700 --> 00:32:36,466
Sorry. The first thing, okay?

414
00:32:36,867 --> 00:32:39,033
You're gonna need to clean out the wound
every couple of hours

415
00:32:39,167 --> 00:32:41,767
and keep as much weight off
the leg as you can, all right?

416
00:32:41,867 --> 00:32:43,369
The island'll do the rest,
John, all right?

417
00:32:43,469 --> 00:32:43,900
But I don't--

418
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,299
Second thing. No, no, pay attention.

419
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:47,933
Next time we see each other,
I'm not gonna recognize you.

420
00:32:48,034 --> 00:32:50,167
All right? You'll give me this.

421
00:32:51,467 --> 00:32:52,917
- All right?
- What is this?

422
00:32:53,667 --> 00:32:56,433
- It's a compass.
- What does it do?

423
00:32:56,533 --> 00:32:58,200
It points north, John.

424
00:32:58,700 --> 00:33:01,566
Look, I wish I had time to
be more sensitive about this

425
00:33:01,666 --> 00:33:03,566
because it's a lot to swallow,

426
00:33:04,266 --> 00:33:06,200
but you need to know it in
order to do what you gotta do.

427
00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:08,166
So I'm just gonna say it, okay?

428
00:33:08,267 --> 00:33:10,066
The only way to save the island, John,

429
00:33:10,166 --> 00:33:12,233
is to get your people back here -
the ones who left.

430
00:33:13,333 --> 00:33:14,633
Jack, Kate...

431
00:33:15,433 --> 00:33:16,933
The chopper was headed for the boat.
The boat--

432
00:33:17,034 --> 00:33:19,433
No, they're fine, John,
and they're already home,

433
00:33:19,533 --> 00:33:21,800
so you have to convince
them to come back.

434
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:24,433
How- how am I supposed to do that?

435
00:33:25,633 --> 00:33:27,300
You're gonna have to die, John.

436
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:35,832
So... what was this thing
before you guys blew it up?

437
00:34:35,933 --> 00:34:38,433
- A Dharma station.
- For what?

438
00:34:38,533 --> 00:34:40,566
There was a man named
Desmond living down in it.

439
00:34:41,066 --> 00:34:43,399
He was pushing a button
every 108 minutes

440
00:34:43,499 --> 00:34:44,632
to save the world.

441
00:34:45,332 --> 00:34:46,665
Really?

442
00:34:47,366 --> 00:34:49,266
Yeah. Really.

443
00:34:55,766 --> 00:34:57,332
Son of a...

444
00:35:02,899 --> 00:35:04,699
...bitch.

445
00:35:25,332 --> 00:35:27,632
The hatch--it's back.

446
00:35:29,599 --> 00:35:31,666
I guess you haven't found it yet.

447
00:35:42,099 --> 00:35:44,200
Hey! Where you goin'?

448
00:35:44,300 --> 00:35:47,665
Back door. I'm gettin' some supplies.

449
00:35:50,133 --> 00:35:52,766
James, wait. Not a good idea.

450
00:35:53,066 --> 00:35:54,666
The sky can flash all it wants,

451
00:35:54,766 --> 00:35:56,333
but I ain't startin' over, Dilbert.

452
00:35:56,433 --> 00:35:57,966
I ain't rubbin' two sticks
together and making a fire,

453
00:35:58,066 --> 00:35:59,266
and I ain't huntin' damn boar!

454
00:35:59,366 --> 00:36:02,699
There's Dharma food, beer
and clothing in there.

455
00:36:03,099 --> 00:36:05,599
And I'm gettin' Desmond to
let me in one way or another.

456
00:36:05,699 --> 00:36:07,899
- That's not gonna work, my friend.
- Why not?

457
00:36:07,999 --> 00:36:10,666
Because Desmond didn't know you
when he first came out of there,

458
00:36:10,816 --> 00:36:13,932
that means you've never met,
which means you can't meet.

459
00:36:14,433 --> 00:36:16,649
This would all be fascinating
if I was listening to you.

460
00:36:16,749 --> 00:36:18,666
So how you do know
Desmond is even in there?

461
00:36:18,766 --> 00:36:20,649
Think about it. It could be anybody.

462
00:36:21,449 --> 00:36:22,366
I don't care who's in there.

463
00:36:24,099 --> 00:36:24,899
Wait...

464
00:36:25,499 --> 00:36:27,633
- Wait.
- Open the damn door!

465
00:36:27,733 --> 00:36:29,633
- It won't work.
- Sure it will.

466
00:36:29,733 --> 00:36:32,266
Yo, open up! It's the
ghost of christmas future!

467
00:36:32,366 --> 00:36:34,849
No one- no one is gonna answer.

468
00:36:34,949 --> 00:36:35,866
Open! Open the damn door! Open the door!

469
00:36:35,966 --> 00:36:37,682
You're wasting your time.

470
00:36:37,782 --> 00:36:38,699
Open up! I know you can hear me.

471
00:36:38,799 --> 00:36:41,699
If it didn't happen, it can't happen.

472
00:36:41,799 --> 00:36:45,466
- Open the damn door!
- You can't change the past, James!

473
00:36:46,866 --> 00:36:51,433
Everybody I care about just
blew up on your damn boat.

474
00:36:51,533 --> 00:36:53,533
I know what I can't change.

475
00:37:01,165 --> 00:37:03,866
We should get back to the beach.

476
00:37:05,733 --> 00:37:07,766
It's been a long day.

477
00:37:24,033 --> 00:37:25,832
Why are we going back to the beach

478
00:37:25,932 --> 00:37:27,799
if there's nothing to go back to?

479
00:37:27,999 --> 00:37:29,866
So stay here.

480
00:37:33,132 --> 00:37:34,966
That chick likes me.

481
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:42,833
What?

482
00:37:42,933 --> 00:37:45,099
Wh- what? What's the matter?

483
00:37:45,199 --> 00:37:46,933
You...

484
00:37:48,299 --> 00:37:51,899
Ugh. I haven't had a nosebleed
since I was little.

485
00:37:53,699 --> 00:37:55,049
Dan, I'm fine.

486
00:37:55,149 --> 00:37:57,848
Yeah. no, no, no, you're--
um, of course you're fine.

487
00:37:57,948 --> 00:38:01,532
I'm, uh... you know,
the sight of blood is,..

488
00:38:01,633 --> 00:38:04,116
Yeah, well, it's a good thing
you're a physicist then, isn't it?

489
00:38:04,266 --> 00:38:05,366
Shall we?

490
00:38:05,466 --> 00:38:07,966
Yeah, um... my pack.

491
00:38:08,033 --> 00:38:11,066
Of course I left my pack
back at the hatch crater.

492
00:38:11,166 --> 00:38:12,266
I better get it.

493
00:38:12,366 --> 00:38:14,100
Why don't you head back
with everyone else and...

494
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:17,420
- I'll be right behind you?
- Don't dillydally.

495
00:38:17,666 --> 00:38:19,666
I wouldn't think of it.

496
00:38:49,465 --> 00:38:51,299
Please let this work.

497
00:38:51,399 --> 00:38:52,866
Please let this work.

498
00:38:52,966 --> 00:38:55,500
Please, please, please, let this work.

499
00:39:03,699 --> 00:39:06,233
- Don't shoot.
- Then you'd best explain

500
00:39:06,333 --> 00:39:07,899
why you've been bangin' on my door

501
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,599
for the last 20 minutes, brother.

502
00:39:10,599 --> 00:39:12,133
Desmond.

503
00:39:15,399 --> 00:39:16,699
Are you him?

504
00:39:16,799 --> 00:39:18,532
"Him"? Who?

505
00:39:18,632 --> 00:39:20,199
My replacement.

506
00:39:22,566 --> 00:39:24,232
No, I'm not.

507
00:39:24,333 --> 00:39:27,632
I'm not. I'm not. I'm...

508
00:39:27,732 --> 00:39:29,399
Do I know you?

509
00:39:29,499 --> 00:39:32,133
Yeah... in a way.

510
00:39:32,333 --> 00:39:34,332
But listen, that's not important.

511
00:39:34,432 --> 00:39:37,266
What is important, Desmond,
is what I'm about to say to you.

512
00:39:37,366 --> 00:39:39,165
I need you to listen.

513
00:39:39,265 --> 00:39:43,666
You're the only person who can
help us because, Desmond...

514
00:39:43,766 --> 00:39:45,366
The rules...

515
00:39:45,466 --> 00:39:49,099
the rules don't apply to you.
You're special.

516
00:39:49,199 --> 00:39:51,432
You're uniquely and
miraculously special.

517
00:39:51,532 --> 00:39:53,399
What are you talking about?

518
00:39:58,266 --> 00:40:00,133
Okay, listen to me. Listen!

519
00:40:00,233 --> 00:40:03,482
If the helicopter somehow
made it off the island,

520
00:40:03,532 --> 00:40:04,799
if you got home--

521
00:40:04,899 --> 00:40:06,478
What helicopter?
What are you talking about?

522
00:40:06,578 --> 00:40:08,698
Listen, I need you to listen,
or people are gonna die.

523
00:40:08,999 --> 00:40:13,600
My name is Daniel Faraday, and right now,

524
00:40:13,700 --> 00:40:17,983
me and everyone else you left behind -
we're in serious danger.

525
00:40:18,133 --> 00:40:19,932
You're the only person who can help us.

526
00:40:20,032 --> 00:40:22,951
I need you to go back
to Oxford University.

527
00:40:23,051 --> 00:40:24,232
Go back to where we met.

528
00:40:24,333 --> 00:40:28,732
I need you to go there and
find my mother. Her name is--

529
00:40:34,532 --> 00:40:36,599
Are you all right?

530
00:40:42,932 --> 00:40:44,933
I was on the island.

531
00:40:47,865 --> 00:40:49,832
I was on the island.

532
00:40:51,132 --> 00:40:54,165
You've been off the island
for three years now.

You're safe now.

534
00:40:57,266 --> 00:40:58,866
It was just a dream.

535
00:41:00,766 --> 00:41:03,100
It wasn't a dream, Pen.

536
00:41:07,099 --> 00:41:08,899
