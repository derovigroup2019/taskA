Previously on "Lost":

2
00:00:01,845 --> 00:00:05,085
The only way to save the island, John,
is to get your people back here.

3
00:00:05,185 --> 00:00:06,525
The chopper was headed
for the boat. The boat--

4
00:00:06,625 --> 00:00:09,340
No, they're fine, John,
and they're already home.

5
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:10,995
So you have convince them
to come back.

6
00:00:11,095 --> 00:00:13,305
How? How am I supposed to do that?

7
00:00:13,405 --> 00:00:15,840
You're gonna have to die, John.

8
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:18,565
You're going down there?

9
00:00:18,665 --> 00:00:20,505
What exactly are you hoping to find?

10
00:00:20,605 --> 00:00:22,580
A way off the island.

11
00:00:33,430 --> 00:00:35,190
Once you get all of
your friends together,

12
00:00:35,290 --> 00:00:37,800
and it must be all of
them, everyone who left,

13
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:39,935
once you've persuaded them to join you,

14
00:00:40,035 --> 00:00:44,255
Eloise Hawking will tell
you exactly how to come back.

15
00:00:44,355 --> 00:00:46,825
Richard said I was going to die.

16
00:00:46,925 --> 00:00:50,190
That's why they call it sacrifice.

17
00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:13,900
Caesar.

18
00:02:16,410 --> 00:02:19,470
Ilana. What's up?

19
00:02:19,790 --> 00:02:21,225
Find anything?

20
00:02:21,325 --> 00:02:22,755
No. Nothing useful.

21
00:02:22,855 --> 00:02:25,420
Then what'd you just put in your bag?

22
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:39,270
If you want it, it's yours.

23
00:02:40,390 --> 00:02:42,810
We found someone. A man.

24
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:45,105
What?

25
00:02:45,205 --> 00:02:49,320
Roxanne was scouting just south of here,
and he was just standing in the water.

26
00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:51,910
He's wearing a suit.

27
00:02:52,010 --> 00:02:55,235
- Nobody recognizes him?
- No. Whoever he is, he didn't come with us.

28
00:02:55,335 --> 00:02:57,435
Then how do we know he isn't
one of the ones who disappeared?

29
00:02:57,535 --> 00:02:58,430
He's not.

30
00:02:58,530 --> 00:02:59,225
And how do you know?

31
00:02:59,325 --> 00:03:01,520
Because he wasn't on the plane.

32
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:03,915
What did this man have to say?

33
00:03:04,015 --> 00:03:06,120
You can ask him yourself.

34
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:26,295
Hello.

35
00:03:26,395 --> 00:03:28,230
Hello.

36
00:03:28,330 --> 00:03:31,610
My name is Caesar. What's yours?

37
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:41,100
My name is John Locke.

Lost Season 05 Episode 07
"The Life and Death of Jeremy Bentham"

41
00:04:18,510 --> 00:04:20,140
Morning.

42
00:04:20,490 --> 00:04:21,880
Hello.

43
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:26,325
Breakfast? We found a tree.
They're pretty good.

44
00:04:26,425 --> 00:04:28,315
Much obliged.

45
00:04:28,415 --> 00:04:30,620
- I'm Ilana.
- John.

46
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:35,410
Are those your boats?

47
00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:39,155
No. They were already here.

48
00:04:39,255 --> 00:04:43,340
There used to be three, but the
pilot and some woman took one.

49
00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:47,815
Didn't tell anyone, just ran
off in the middle of the night.

50
00:04:47,915 --> 00:04:49,835
The pilot of the plane
that brought you here?

51
00:04:49,935 --> 00:04:52,470
Yes. That's right.

52
00:04:53,030 --> 00:04:55,880
Do you have a passenger list?

53
00:04:57,860 --> 00:05:00,500
You'll have to talk to Caesar.

54
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:17,850
I think this is the best
mango I've ever eaten.

55
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:24,310
Nobody remembers you being on the plane.

56
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:27,440
Well, I don't remember
being on it either.

57
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:29,895
- What do you remember?
- I remember a lot.

58
00:05:29,995 --> 00:05:32,920
Like why you're dressed up so nice?

59
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:35,785
No, but I can guess.

60
00:05:35,885 --> 00:05:38,690
Please. Guess.

61
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:45,620
I think this suit is what
they were gonna bury me in.

62
00:05:47,010 --> 00:05:49,810
- Sorry?
- You asked what I remembered.

63
00:05:54,590 --> 00:05:56,660
I remember dying.

64
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:11,850
Good luck, John.

65
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:23,020
Say hello to my son.

66
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:25,310
Who's your son?

67
00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:45,940

68
00:07:15,410 --> 00:07:19,430
Is anybody in there? Can you help me?

69
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:04,540
God!

70
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:28,990
where is this? Where am I?
Where am I? Where is this?

71
00:08:35,060 --> 00:08:38,810
Sir, where am I? Who are you?

72
00:08:40,470 --> 00:08:43,740
Where am I? Do you speak English?

73
00:08:47,150 --> 00:08:50,960
You swallow. Swallow.

74
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,140
Where are we?

75
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:08,125
Oh--what? What?
What? What--

76
00:09:08,225 --> 00:09:11,400
You bite. Bite!

77
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:52,440
John?

78
00:09:52,870 --> 00:09:55,760
John, wake up.

79
00:10:03,610 --> 00:10:06,235
You had a compound fracture.

80
00:10:06,335 --> 00:10:11,370
The doctors here did their best, but I had a
specialist flown in to reset your leg properly.

81
00:10:18,530 --> 00:10:20,950
It's nice to see you again, John.

82
00:10:21,330 --> 00:10:24,340
- Do I know you?
- Yes.

83
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:29,040
I understand your being confused.

84
00:10:29,410 --> 00:10:32,010
Imagine how I feel.

85
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:36,110
I met you when I was 17.

86
00:10:36,610 --> 00:10:39,930
And now, all these years later, 
here we are.

87
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:44,860
You look exactly the same.

88
00:10:46,770 --> 00:10:48,165
Who are you?

89
00:10:48,265 --> 00:10:50,770
My name is Charles Widmore.

90
00:10:52,930 --> 00:10:57,355
Tell me, John. How long
has it been for you since...

91
00:10:57,455 --> 00:11:03,420
we first met, since you walked into
our camp and you spoke to Richard?

92
00:11:04,290 --> 00:11:06,570
Four days.

93
00:11:06,670 --> 00:11:08,405
That's incredible.

94
00:11:08,505 --> 00:11:10,829
The camera in the desert - 
that was yours?

95
00:11:10,879 --> 00:11:11,605
Yeah.

96
00:11:11,905 --> 00:11:13,440
How did you know I'd be there?

97
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:15,890
Because that's the exit.

98
00:11:16,330 --> 00:11:21,780
I was afraid Benjamin might fool you into
leaving the island, like he did with me.

99
00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:25,365
I was their leader.

100
00:11:25,465 --> 00:11:26,650
The Others?

101
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:29,100
They're not the "Others"
to me. They're my people.

102
00:11:29,650 --> 00:11:34,175
We protected the island peacefully
for more than three decades.

103
00:11:34,275 --> 00:11:39,000
But then I was exiled by him...

104
00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:40,860
just as you were.

105
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:44,665
No. Ben wasn't even there when
I left. He was already gone.

106
00:11:44,765 --> 00:11:49,325
I-I... I wasn't exiled.
I... chose to leave.

107
00:11:49,425 --> 00:11:53,540
Why would you do that, John?

108
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:02,100
You've come to bring them back,
the ones who left.

109
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:05,900
No.

110
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:08,960
I understand you lying to me. I do.

111
00:12:10,470 --> 00:12:12,030
But there's something you should know.

112
00:12:12,130 --> 00:12:15,230
All your friends who left the island?

113
00:12:15,870 --> 00:12:18,115
They've been back three years.

114
00:12:18,215 --> 00:12:19,400
Three years?

115
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:21,870
And they've gone back
to their normal lives.

116
00:12:21,970 --> 00:12:26,080
and none of them has spoken a word
of truth about where they were.

117
00:12:33,510 --> 00:12:35,000
I have to bring them back.

118
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:38,590
And I'm gonna do everything in
my power to help you do that.

119
00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:42,900
Why?

120
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:45,130
"Why"?

121
00:12:45,230 --> 00:12:47,650
Why would you help me?

122
00:12:49,780 --> 00:12:52,740
Because there's a war coming, John.

123
00:12:53,970 --> 00:12:58,045
And if you're not back on
the island when that happens,

124
00:12:58,145 --> 00:13:01,290
the wrong side is going to win.

125
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:12,105
"Jeremy Bentham"?

126
00:13:12,205 --> 00:13:14,335
He was a British philosopher.

127
00:13:14,435 --> 00:13:18,720
Your parents had a sense of humor
when they named you, so why can't I?

128
00:13:20,110 --> 00:13:22,850
This should be money enough for now.

129
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:25,515
The phone's international.

130
00:13:25,615 --> 00:13:30,380
If you need to reach me,
for anything, just press 2-3.

131
00:13:31,020 --> 00:13:33,812
The folder contains
your people's whereabouts,

132
00:13:33,862 --> 00:13:36,410
everyone that was on
the island that left.

133
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:41,855
You've been watching them?

134
00:13:41,955 --> 00:13:45,710
I'm deeply invested in the
future of the island, John.

135
00:13:45,990 --> 00:13:48,980
So, yes, I've been watching them.

136
00:13:51,110 --> 00:13:52,540
I wouldn't mention I'm involved in this.

137
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:55,915
I can't imagine what they think of
me, having listened to Benjamin's lies.

138
00:13:56,015 --> 00:13:58,055
How do I know that you're
not the one who's lying?

139
00:13:58,155 --> 00:14:00,705
I haven't tried to kill you.

140
00:14:00,805 --> 00:14:03,590
Would you say the same for him?

141
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:07,950
You still don't trust me.

142
00:14:08,050 --> 00:14:11,860
You sent a team of killers and
a boatload of C4 to the island.

143
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:14,895
That... doesn't exactly scream "trust."

144
00:14:14,995 --> 00:14:17,500
I needed Linus removed,

145
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,780
so it could be your time.

146
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:22,285
Right.

147
00:14:22,385 --> 00:14:25,275
The island needs you, John.

148
00:14:25,375 --> 00:14:27,210
It has for a long time.

149
00:14:27,310 --> 00:14:30,150
What makes you think I'm so special?

150
00:14:32,870 --> 00:14:35,620
Because you are.

151
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:45,920
Your chariot has arrived.

152
00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:48,140
He said I would die.

153
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:49,460
I beg your pardon?

154
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:54,030
Richard Alpert. He said the only way
to get them to come back was if I died.

155
00:14:54,930 --> 00:14:59,990
I don't know why he said that,
but I'm not gonna let that happen.

156
00:15:02,890 --> 00:15:04,655
This is Matthew Abaddon.

157
00:15:04,755 --> 00:15:07,114
He'll take you anywhere you need to go, 

158
00:15:07,164 --> 00:15:10,060
protect you from whomever
intends to do you harm.

159
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,590
Mr. Locke.

160
00:15:25,630 --> 00:15:28,750
Good luck, John, and godspeed.

161
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:52,675
Anything you need, Mr. Locke,
you just let me know.

162
00:15:52,775 --> 00:15:55,220
Anything.

163
00:15:56,260 --> 00:15:59,280
Anybody from your past you
want me to look up for you?

164
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:02,300
The whole world thinks
you're dead, Mr. Locke.

165
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:04,185
There must be somebody
who'd be happy to see you.

166
00:16:04,285 --> 00:16:06,600
Please don't talk to me.

167
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:09,060
You got it.

168
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:17,412
But we're almost at the airport,

169
00:16:17,462 --> 00:16:20,070
so you're gonna at least have to
tell me where we're going first.

170
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:22,900
Santo Domingo.

171
00:16:30,830 --> 00:16:34,210

172
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:54,545
Finally. I need it for the roof.

173
00:16:54,645 --> 00:16:56,990
Pass me another beam.

174
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:02,340
Hey, Sayid!

175
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:04,990
Look! You have a visitor.

176
00:17:12,860 --> 00:17:15,785
I don't believe this.
You actually want me to go back?

177
00:17:15,885 --> 00:17:19,005
I-I know how it sounds, Sayid,
but you have to trust me.

178
00:17:19,105 --> 00:17:20,725
This is the only way to save them.

179
00:17:20,825 --> 00:17:23,130
I'm not going back.

180
00:17:23,940 --> 00:17:27,475
For two years, I was manipulated into thinking
I was protecting everyone on the island.

181
00:17:27,575 --> 00:17:29,490
Who was manipulating you?

182
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:31,950
Ben.

183
00:17:35,550 --> 00:17:37,465
So who is manipulating you, John?

184
00:17:37,565 --> 00:17:40,320
This is coming from me, nobody else.

185
00:17:40,710 --> 00:17:42,335
I know you, Sayid.

186
00:17:42,435 --> 00:17:45,475
And deep down in your heart, you know
we never should've left the island.

187
00:17:45,575 --> 00:17:50,170
It's only because I left the island that I
was finally able to marry the woman I loved.

188
00:17:52,350 --> 00:17:58,060
We spent nine months together,
the best nine months of my life, John.

189
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:02,460
That's what I know in my heart.

190
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:05,395
Where is she now?

191
00:18:05,795 --> 00:18:07,570
She was murdered.

192
00:18:14,210 --> 00:18:15,890
I'm sorry.

193
00:18:17,140 --> 00:18:20,080
Why do you really need to go back?

194
00:18:21,290 --> 00:18:24,320
Is it just because you
have nowhere else to go?

195
00:18:29,450 --> 00:18:32,595
If you change your mind, I'll be staying
under the name "Jeremy Bentham" in L.A.

196
00:18:32,695 --> 00:18:34,560
at the Westerfield Hotel.

197
00:18:37,210 --> 00:18:42,020
And if you change your mind, you're welcome
to come back here and do some real good.

198
00:18:46,850 --> 00:18:48,980
Good-bye, John.

199
00:18:54,870 --> 00:18:57,490

200
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:09,885
You asked if there was someone
you could look up for me.

201
00:19:09,985 --> 00:19:11,990
Yes, I did.

202
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:16,920
Her name is Helen, Helen Norwood,
and she was living in Los Angeles.

203
00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:19,320
She an old girlfriend of yours?

204
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:25,850
Help me get out of the car.

205
00:19:29,450 --> 00:19:31,430
So that's Michael Dawson's son, huh?

206
00:19:31,810 --> 00:19:35,210
Yeah. Boy's gotten big.

207
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:53,260
Um, I'm-- I'll be right back. Gotta go.

208
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:56,110
I'll give you two some privacy.

209
00:20:03,010 --> 00:20:05,130
- Hey, John.
- Hi, Walt.

210
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:08,220
- What happened?
- I hurt my leg.

211
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:12,105
You don't seem surprised to see me.

212
00:20:12,205 --> 00:20:14,705
I've been having dreams about you.

213
00:20:14,805 --> 00:20:19,555
You were on the island, wearing a suit,
and there are people all around you.

214
00:20:19,655 --> 00:20:21,940
They wanted to hurt you, John.

215
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:25,180
Good thing they're just dreams.

216
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:28,795
Is my dad... is he back on the island?

217
00:20:28,895 --> 00:20:31,055
I haven't talked to him in three years.

218
00:20:31,155 --> 00:20:33,660
I figured he must've gone back.

219
00:20:36,230 --> 00:20:40,280
Um, last I heard, your dad was
on a freighter near the island.

220
00:20:43,710 --> 00:20:46,330
So why'd you come to see me?

221
00:20:52,350 --> 00:20:54,875
I just wanted to make
sure you were okay.

222
00:20:54,975 --> 00:20:57,810
Yeah. I'm doing pretty good.

223
00:20:58,860 --> 00:21:02,075
Well, I gotta go.
It was good seeing you, John.

224
00:21:02,175 --> 00:21:05,480
Yeah. Take care.

225
00:21:11,530 --> 00:21:14,070
I take it you didn't invite him along.

226
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,590
Boy's been through enough.

227
00:21:16,690 --> 00:21:18,370
That's 0-for-2,
Mr. Locke.

228
00:21:18,470 --> 00:21:21,970
Maybe I misunderstood, but I thought
you had to bring everyone back.

229
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:27,200
I only need to convince one. And if
I can do that, the rest will come.

230
00:21:28,060 --> 00:21:32,540
And maybe I was mistaken, but
I thought you we my driver.

231
00:21:41,570 --> 00:21:44,770

232
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:58,360
Hello, Hugo.

233
00:22:02,090 --> 00:22:04,200
So you didn't make it, huh?

234
00:22:05,730 --> 00:22:06,865
Pardon me?

235
00:22:06,965 --> 00:22:10,720
You didn't make it.
It's cool. No biggie.

236
00:22:11,270 --> 00:22:13,865
You're not the first person
to visit me, you know.

237
00:22:13,965 --> 00:22:15,425
But what's up with the wheelchair?

238
00:22:15,525 --> 00:22:18,600
Uh, I broke my leg falling down a hole.

239
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:20,840
Is that how you died?

240
00:22:23,090 --> 00:22:25,850
Hugo, I'm not dead.

241
00:22:28,250 --> 00:22:29,170
Sure you're not.

242
00:22:29,270 --> 00:22:32,240
No, I-I promise you,
I'm very much alive.

243
00:22:32,570 --> 00:22:35,695
Hey, Susie, am I talking to a
dude in a wheelchair right now?

244
00:22:35,795 --> 00:22:37,330
Yep.

245
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:42,850
Whoa, dude. What are you doing here?

246
00:22:43,290 --> 00:22:45,635
I need you to come back
to the island with me.

247
00:22:45,735 --> 00:22:46,935
Wait. What?

248
00:22:47,015 --> 00:22:49,515
And not just you
but everybody who left.

249
00:22:49,615 --> 00:22:51,940
- You mean Jack and Kate--
- Everybody.

250
00:22:55,870 --> 00:22:58,300
I'm sorry, dude. I don't
think that's gonna happen.

251
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:05,160
Jack's a doctor now, and--and Sun's,
like, got her baby, and Kate's got Aaron.

252
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:13,685
Dude, be cool. Don't look,
but we're being watched.

253
00:23:13,785 --> 00:23:15,495
Dude!

254
00:23:15,595 --> 00:23:17,855
- Oh, don't worry. He's with me.
- What?

255
00:23:17,955 --> 00:23:19,605
He's just driving me around. He's okay.

256
00:23:19,705 --> 00:23:21,985
That dude is far from okay.

257
00:23:22,085 --> 00:23:26,080
When I first got locked up in here, he showed
up, claiming that he worked for Oceanic Air.

258
00:23:26,180 --> 00:23:27,545
He's evil!

259
00:23:27,645 --> 00:23:29,005
You should not be trusting that guy.

260
00:23:29,105 --> 00:23:31,415
- Please, just listen to me.
- No, no, no! I'm not listening to you!

261
00:23:31,515 --> 00:23:34,860
- Hugo, please, listen.
- La, la, la, la, la. I wanna go back in.

262
00:23:35,190 --> 00:23:36,135
- I wanna go back in.
- Hugo.

263
00:23:36,235 --> 00:23:39,950
No, I'm not going anywhere
with you! Go away! Bye!

264
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:43,010
- Get out of here!
- You're safe.

265
00:23:53,740 --> 00:23:56,055
That's three visits now.

266
00:23:56,155 --> 00:23:59,114
You may wanna step up
your game, Mr. Locke,

267
00:23:59,164 --> 00:24:01,360
or we're all in serious trouble.

268
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:07,730
What exactly is it that you
do for Mr. Widmore, Matthew?

269
00:24:09,980 --> 00:24:12,290
You're ready to talk about it now, huh?

270
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:16,415
John...

271
00:24:16,515 --> 00:24:18,140
you're not really gonna
pretend you don't remember

272
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:21,675
that I was an orderly in the
hospital right after your accident?

273
00:24:21,775 --> 00:24:24,975
That I was the one who told
you to go on your walkabout?

274
00:24:25,075 --> 00:24:29,250
The same walkabout that put you on
the plane that crashed on that island?

275
00:24:30,190 --> 00:24:33,295
No. I remember.

276
00:24:33,395 --> 00:24:37,130
I help people get to where
they need to get to, John.

277
00:24:37,830 --> 00:24:40,990
That's what I do for Mr. Widmore.

278
00:24:49,900 --> 00:24:52,650

279
00:25:01,990 --> 00:25:04,310
The answer is no.

280
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:06,835
Kate, I don't think you understand--

281
00:25:06,935 --> 00:25:08,755
No, you made yourself perfectly clear.

282
00:25:08,855 --> 00:25:12,150
Everyone on the island is
gonna die if I don't go back.

283
00:25:12,250 --> 00:25:13,655
And the answer is no.

284
00:25:13,755 --> 00:25:16,750
Why? Don't you care about them?

285
00:25:21,590 --> 00:25:24,720
- Have you ever been in love, John?
- What?

286
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:28,195
I think about you sometimes.

287
00:25:28,295 --> 00:25:33,080
I think about how desperate
you were to stay on that island.

288
00:25:37,580 --> 00:25:40,920
And then I realized...

289
00:25:41,610 --> 00:25:45,060
it was all because you
didn't love anybody.

290
00:25:46,410 --> 00:25:49,025
That's not true.

291
00:25:49,125 --> 00:25:51,530
I loved someone...

292
00:25:51,980 --> 00:25:54,390
once.

293
00:25:56,390 --> 00:25:58,920
Her name was Helen.

294
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:05,700
What happened?

295
00:26:06,330 --> 00:26:11,850
Well... it--it...
it just didn't work out.

296
00:26:13,970 --> 00:26:16,520
Why not, John?

297
00:26:20,330 --> 00:26:24,030
I was angry. I was...

298
00:26:27,050 --> 00:26:29,550
obs- obsessed.

299
00:26:30,190 --> 00:26:33,250
And look how far you've come.

300
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:50,555
Let me help you, Mr. Locke.

301
00:26:50,655 --> 00:26:52,975
- Did you find her?
- Find who?

302
00:26:53,075 --> 00:26:55,805
Helen Norwood.
The woman I asked you about.

303
00:26:55,905 --> 00:26:57,530
No, I didn't. I'm sorry.

304
00:26:57,870 --> 00:26:59,165
Three years is a long time.

305
00:26:59,265 --> 00:27:00,945
It's possible she got
married, changed her name.

306
00:27:01,045 --> 00:27:05,180
- Maybe she moved out of state.
- You found everyone else! All of them.

307
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:07,716
Sayid was in the middle of nowhere,

308
00:27:07,866 --> 00:27:10,030
  but you can't find Helen
because she moved?

309
00:27:10,910 --> 00:27:13,035
Your job is to get people
to where they need to get to?

310
00:27:13,135 --> 00:27:15,650
Well, I need to get to her.

311
00:27:19,810 --> 00:27:22,650

312
00:27:36,860 --> 00:27:39,065
What happened to her?

313
00:27:39,165 --> 00:27:41,625
She died of a brain aneurysm.

314
00:27:41,725 --> 00:27:44,320
I'm very sorry, Mr. Locke.

315
00:27:52,740 --> 00:27:55,250
She loved me.

316
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:57,900
If I had just...

317
00:28:02,020 --> 00:28:04,440
We could've been together.

318
00:28:04,540 --> 00:28:06,655
Maybe you could have.

319
00:28:06,755 --> 00:28:09,095
That wouldn't change anything.
She'd still be gone.

320
00:28:09,195 --> 00:28:11,420
Would she?

321
00:28:14,810 --> 00:28:17,800
Helen is where she's supposed to be.

322
00:28:18,090 --> 00:28:20,955
As sad as it is, her path led here.

323
00:28:21,055 --> 00:28:23,670
And your path, no matter
what you did or what you do,

324
00:28:23,820 --> 00:28:25,860
 your path leads back to the island.

325
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:32,580
You say that like it's
all det--inevitable.

326
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:36,430
Mr. Widmore told me Richard Alpert
said that you were going to die.

327
00:28:36,740 --> 00:28:38,315
So you tell me, John.

328
00:28:38,415 --> 00:28:40,550
Is that inevitable, or is it a choice?

329
00:28:40,650 --> 00:28:43,085
What, you think I wanna die?

330
00:28:43,185 --> 00:28:44,735
How is that...

331
00:28:44,835 --> 00:28:48,130
how could you possibly
think that's a choice?

332
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:54,460
I'm just your driver.

333
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:13,390
Matthew!

334
00:30:15,530 --> 00:30:17,980
What are you doing here?

335
00:30:22,450 --> 00:30:25,235
Jack, how did you find me?

336
00:30:25,335 --> 00:30:29,260
You were in a car accident and
you were brought into my hospital.

337
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:32,710
What are you doing here?

338
00:30:37,110 --> 00:30:39,350
We have to go back.

339
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:43,955
Of course. Of course we do.

340
00:30:44,055 --> 00:30:46,315
Jack, the people I
left behind need our help.

341
00:30:46,415 --> 00:30:49,055
- We're supposed to go back--
- ...because it's our destiny.

342
00:30:49,155 --> 00:30:51,610
How many times are you
gonna say that to me, John?

343
00:30:51,710 --> 00:30:53,750
How can you not see it?

344
00:30:53,850 --> 00:30:56,860
Of all the hospitals they could've
brought me to, I end up here.

345
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:58,135
You don't think that's fate?

346
00:30:58,235 --> 00:31:01,400
Your car accident was on
the west side of Los Angeles.

347
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:04,770
You being brought into my
hospital isn't fate, John.

348
00:31:04,870 --> 00:31:05,823
It's probability.

349
00:31:05,873 --> 00:31:08,215
You don't understand.
It wasn't an accident.

350
00:31:08,315 --> 00:31:11,835
- Someone is trying to kill me.
- Why? Why would someone try to kill you?

351
00:31:11,935 --> 00:31:14,020
Because they don't want me to succeed.

352
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:15,405
They wanna stop me.

353
00:31:15,505 --> 00:31:19,550
They don't want me to get
back because I'm important.

354
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:27,165
Have you ever stopped to
think that these delusions

355
00:31:27,265 --> 00:31:30,565
that you're special aren't real?

356
00:31:30,665 --> 00:31:34,180
That maybe there's nothing
important about you at all?

357
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:39,910
Maybe you are just a lonely old
man that crashed on an island.

358
00:31:40,810 --> 00:31:42,460
That's it.

359
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:46,540
Good-bye, John.

360
00:31:47,980 --> 00:31:50,430
Your father says hello.

361
00:31:52,450 --> 00:31:53,940
What?

362
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:58,036
A man, the man who told
me to move the island,

363
00:31:58,086 --> 00:32:00,135
the man who told me
how to bring you all back,

364
00:32:00,235 --> 00:32:01,955
he said to tell his son hello.

365
00:32:02,555 --> 00:32:04,786
It couldn't have been Sayid's father,
and it wasn't Hurley's.

366
00:32:04,936 --> 00:32:06,600
That leaves you.

367
00:32:07,490 --> 00:32:10,130
He said his name was Christian.

368
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:17,895
My... my father is dead.

369
00:32:17,995 --> 00:32:20,000
Well, he didn't look dead to me.

370
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:22,447
He died in Australia three years ago.

371
00:32:22,597 --> 00:32:24,240
I put him in the coffin!

372
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:27,310
He's dead.

373
00:32:27,410 --> 00:32:29,455
Jack, please, you have to come back!

374
00:32:29,555 --> 00:32:31,550
You're the only one who can
convince the rest of 'em.

375
00:32:31,650 --> 00:32:33,355
You have to help me!
You're supposed to help me!

376
00:32:33,455 --> 00:32:36,185
John, it's over! It's done.

377
00:32:36,285 --> 00:32:39,900
We left, and we were
never important. So you...

378
00:32:40,610 --> 00:32:42,440
you leave me alone.

379
00:32:42,540 --> 00:32:45,150
And you leave the rest of 'em alone!

380
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:06,760
(Jack, I wish you had believed me.)

381
00:35:11,420 --> 00:35:12,460
John?

382
00:35:13,210 --> 00:35:14,250
John?

383
00:35:18,690 --> 00:35:20,700
John, what are you doing?

384
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:24,630
Wait, please. John, stop!

385
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:29,335
How did you find me?

386
00:35:29,435 --> 00:35:31,970
I have a man watching Sayid.

387
00:35:32,390 --> 00:35:36,225
I'm watching all of them,
keeping them safe.

388
00:35:36,325 --> 00:35:38,385
When you turned up, he called me.

389
00:35:38,485 --> 00:35:42,285
Who-- who--?
W-what are you doing here?

390
00:35:42,385 --> 00:35:44,145
- John, just calm down.
- What do you want from me?

391
00:35:44,245 --> 00:35:46,215
- Please, let me help--
- Answer the question!

392
00:35:46,315 --> 00:35:48,415
I'm trying to protect you.

393
00:35:48,915 --> 00:35:50,490
Protect me?

394
00:35:54,310 --> 00:35:56,085
You shot him.

395
00:35:56,885 --> 00:35:58,725
You killed Abaddon.

396
00:35:58,825 --> 00:35:59,696
Yes.

397
00:36:00,746 --> 00:36:02,185
Yes, I did.

398
00:36:02,285 --> 00:36:04,740
But it was only a matter of
time before he'd try to kill you.

399
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:07,875
I was just trying to get to you,
but you drove off and crashed.

400
00:36:07,975 --> 00:36:10,255
- Why? Why would--?
- He was working for Charles Widmore.

401
00:36:10,305 --> 00:36:12,195
- He's extremely dangerous.
- No!

402
00:36:12,295 --> 00:36:15,635
Widmore came to me. He saved me.

403
00:36:15,735 --> 00:36:17,060
No, John, he used you.

404
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:20,760
He waited till you showed up so that
you could help him get to the island.

405
00:36:20,860 --> 00:36:24,280
Charles Widmore is the
reason I moved the island!

406
00:36:24,980 --> 00:36:30,060
So that he could never find it again,
to keep him away so that you could lead.

407
00:36:40,110 --> 00:36:42,135
You can't do this.

408
00:36:42,235 --> 00:36:45,090
If anything happens to you...

409
00:36:45,460 --> 00:36:48,460
John, you have no idea
how important you are.

410
00:36:51,180 --> 00:36:53,150
Let me help you.

411
00:36:55,850 --> 00:36:58,420
There is no helping me.

412
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:01,950
I'm...

413
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:06,390
- I'm a failure.
- No, John, you're not.

414
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:07,560
I am!

415
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:11,148
I couldn't get any of them.

416
00:37:11,198 --> 00:37:13,860
I couldn't get a single one
of them to come back with me.

417
00:37:15,230 --> 00:37:17,050
I can't lead anyone.

418
00:37:17,150 --> 00:37:19,440
Jack booked a ticket.

419
00:37:22,290 --> 00:37:23,480
W-what?

420
00:37:23,580 --> 00:37:26,590
A plane ticket from Los
Angeles to Sydney, tonight.

421
00:37:26,890 --> 00:37:29,490
Return trip first thing in the morning.

422
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:37,745
Whatever you said to
him, John. It worked.

423
00:37:37,845 --> 00:37:39,496
And if you got Jack,

424
00:37:39,946 --> 00:37:41,740
you gonna get the rest of them.

425
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:48,963
John...

426
00:37:49,713 --> 00:37:51,265
You can't die.

427
00:37:51,665 --> 00:37:54,310
You've got too much work to do.

428
00:37:55,110 --> 00:37:58,260
We've gotta get you back to that
island so that you can do it.

429
00:38:15,060 --> 00:38:16,618
Please, John.

430
00:38:17,468 --> 00:38:18,910
Come on.

431
00:38:23,270 --> 00:38:24,930
Come down.

432
00:38:42,620 --> 00:38:44,865
I know we can do this, John.

433
00:38:45,265 --> 00:38:48,000
You haven't even been to Sun yet.

434
00:38:48,890 --> 00:38:51,230
- Let's start with her.
- No.

435
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:53,110
I...

436
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:56,475
I promised Jin that I
wouldn't bring her back.

437
00:38:56,575 --> 00:38:59,550
- Jin is alive?
- Yeah.

438
00:38:59,890 --> 00:39:04,560
Yeah. But he didn't want her to know.
He--he wanted me to tell her that his...

439
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:08,255
that his body washed up on the beach.

440
00:39:08,655 --> 00:39:11,315
And, uh, he gave me his
wedding ring to prove it.

441
00:39:11,715 --> 00:39:13,250
All right.

442
00:39:14,220 --> 00:39:16,520
A promise is a promise.

443
00:39:26,230 --> 00:39:28,130
Thank you.

444
00:39:30,590 --> 00:39:32,330
You're welcome.

445
00:39:33,620 --> 00:39:35,250
Come on.

446
00:39:40,010 --> 00:39:41,590
Let's go.

447
00:39:43,220 --> 00:39:45,300
I know we can do this.

448
00:39:45,700 --> 00:39:48,440
Once we can get them
all in the same place...

449
00:39:50,330 --> 00:39:53,910
I don't know where we go from there,
but we'll figure something out.

450
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:56,580
I know where we go.

451
00:39:57,720 --> 00:40:00,090
There's a woman here in Los Angeles.

452
00:40:00,190 --> 00:40:01,245
- A woman?
- Yeah.

453
00:40:01,345 --> 00:40:05,416
I don't know exactly where,
but she shouldn't be that hard to find.

454
00:40:05,566 --> 00:40:07,425
 Her name is--is, uh...

455
00:40:08,225 --> 00:40:10,210
Eloise Hawking.

456
00:40:12,810 --> 00:40:14,435
Eloise Hawking? You sure?

457
00:40:14,535 --> 00:40:17,470
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, why?
Do you know her?

458
00:40:19,370 --> 00:40:22,380
Yes. John. I know her.

459
00:42:00,940 --> 00:42:02,880
I'll miss you, John.

460
00:42:04,910 --> 00:42:06,580
I really will.

461
00:42:36,370 --> 00:42:41,030
That symbol, it belongs to an
organization called the Dharma Initiative.

462
00:42:42,090 --> 00:42:45,130
They were conducting some
experiments here a while back.

463
00:42:46,190 --> 00:42:47,255
How do you know that?

464
00:42:47,355 --> 00:42:50,155
I spent more than a hundred days
on this island. I know a lot.

465
00:42:50,255 --> 00:42:51,795
A hundred days?

466
00:42:51,895 --> 00:42:54,655
So when we crashed,
you were already here.

467
00:42:55,155 --> 00:42:58,002
No. No, I, uh... 

468
00:42:58,052 --> 00:42:59,210
I left.

469
00:43:00,450 --> 00:43:02,620
How long ago did you leave?

470
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:06,175
The timing would just confuse you.

471
00:43:06,675 --> 00:43:09,245
Well... how did you get back?

472
00:43:09,745 --> 00:43:12,750
To be honest, that part's
a bit of a mystery to me.

473
00:43:13,150 --> 00:43:14,790
Okay, John Locke...

474
00:43:16,110 --> 00:43:18,105
I have a mystery, too.

475
00:43:18,905 --> 00:43:20,835
Maybe you can help me with it.

476
00:43:21,235 --> 00:43:22,945
I'm happy to try.

477
00:43:23,745 --> 00:43:28,490
On the plane, I was sitting across the aisle
from that really big guy with curly hair.

478
00:43:29,150 --> 00:43:32,015
When the plane started
shaking, really shaking...

479
00:43:32,115 --> 00:43:35,125
there was a big noise
and a bright light.

480
00:43:35,225 --> 00:43:37,655
And this really big
guy with curly hair...

481
00:43:37,755 --> 00:43:40,565
...was gone, man.
I mean, literally gone.

482
00:43:40,665 --> 00:43:42,560
And it wasn't only him.

483
00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:45,905
Some of us saw it happen
to other people, too.

484
00:43:46,405 --> 00:43:48,034
So, Mr. John Locke,

485
00:43:49,284 --> 00:43:51,550
do you have an idea about what happened?

486
00:43:54,530 --> 00:43:56,770
I think...

487
00:43:56,870 --> 00:43:59,390
I might know how I came to be here.

488
00:44:01,840 --> 00:44:03,775
But that would involve
me finding my friends.

489
00:44:03,875 --> 00:44:06,815
- Do you have a passenger list?
 - No.

490
00:44:06,915 --> 00:44:08,530
The pilot took it when he ran off.

491
00:44:08,630 --> 00:44:10,740
And everyone's accounted for?
All the people,

492
00:44:10,840 --> 00:44:12,900
O-other than the--the
ones who disappeared?

493
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,385
Yeah, yeah, except for
the people who got hurt.

494
00:44:15,785 --> 00:44:17,860
"The people who got hurt"?

495
00:44:50,890 --> 00:44:52,660
You know him?

496
00:44:54,040 --> 00:44:55,180
Yeah.

497
00:44:58,750 --> 00:45:00,760
He's the man who killed me.

498
00:45:00,885 --> 00:45:02,585
