1
00:00:02,002 --> 00:00:03,670
Previously on Lost:

2
00:00:03,754 --> 00:00:07,173
Jack is on his way
to blow up a hydrogen bomb.

3
00:00:07,257 --> 00:00:08,508
We have to stop him.

4
00:00:12,096 --> 00:00:15,598
Jack, we need to be there
at the moment of the incident.

5
00:00:16,767 --> 00:00:19,268
- Why the hell are we stopping?
- That's why.

6
00:00:29,363 --> 00:00:31,989
- What's going on, Kate?
- Doc, we gotta talk.

7
00:00:36,286 --> 00:00:40,248
- You wanna talk, get in the van...
- I ain't gettin' in the van!

8
00:00:40,332 --> 00:00:44,502
I need five minutes. Say what I gotta
say, then you can do whatever you want.

9
00:00:46,463 --> 00:00:48,798
But you're gonna listen.
You owe me that much.

10
00:00:53,887 --> 00:00:55,263
Five minutes.

11
00:01:26,879 --> 00:01:30,089
Dr Shephard? You all right?

12
00:01:30,174 --> 00:01:32,467
The dural sac. I cut it.

13
00:01:33,761 --> 00:01:36,262
- Give me some suction.
- Calm down. It's all right.

14
00:01:36,346 --> 00:01:38,556
- Fluid's leaking.
- Look at me.

15
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:41,642
- Give me some suction.
- Jack.

16
00:01:41,727 --> 00:01:43,686
Look at me.

17
00:01:44,897 --> 00:01:47,648
Count to five.

18
00:01:47,733 --> 00:01:50,651
- What are you talking about?
- Stitching up the sac

19
00:01:50,736 --> 00:01:53,863
so this girl isn't paralyzed
for the rest of her life.

20
00:01:53,947 --> 00:01:57,408
The only way you're gonna do that
is not to be afraid.

21
00:01:57,493 --> 00:02:00,953
So close your eyes and count to five.

22
00:02:01,038 --> 00:02:03,414
And then fix her, Jack.

23
00:02:07,169 --> 00:02:08,836
Or I'll have to fix her for you.

24
00:02:18,597 --> 00:02:22,058
One, two,

25
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:25,144
three, four...

26
00:02:26,939 --> 00:02:27,980
...five.

27
00:02:31,693 --> 00:02:33,277
Sutures.

28
00:02:53,715 --> 00:02:55,758
Hey, kiddo.

29
00:02:55,843 --> 00:02:59,136
Girl's in recovery, responsive
to stimulus below the waist,

30
00:02:59,221 --> 00:03:02,473
so no paralysis.

31
00:03:03,141 --> 00:03:05,017
Good.

32
00:03:05,894 --> 00:03:08,396
Something wrong, Jack?

33
00:03:09,273 --> 00:03:10,523
You embarrassed me.

34
00:03:12,359 --> 00:03:15,486
- Did I?
- It was bad enough

35
00:03:15,571 --> 00:03:19,073
that everybody thinks
the reason I got this residency

36
00:03:19,157 --> 00:03:22,660
is because you're my father.
But then you...

37
00:03:22,744 --> 00:03:26,038
You put me in a timeout
during my first major procedure!

38
00:03:26,123 --> 00:03:28,332
In front of my entire team.

39
00:03:29,501 --> 00:03:32,837
Dad, I know you don't believe in me,

40
00:03:32,921 --> 00:03:34,589
but I need them to.

41
00:03:35,841 --> 00:03:40,136
Are you sure I'm the one
who doesn't believe in you, Jack?

42
00:03:48,562 --> 00:03:50,146
One of these yours?

43
00:03:54,359 --> 00:03:58,487
- Machine got stuck.
- Guess it just needed a little push.

44
00:04:15,047 --> 00:04:18,466
- Take a load off, doc.
- No, thanks.

45
00:04:19,509 --> 00:04:21,218
Sit down, Jack.

46
00:04:30,187 --> 00:04:33,022
My folks died when I was eight.
I ever tell you that?

47
00:04:35,192 --> 00:04:36,692
No.

48
00:04:36,777 --> 00:04:39,779
Con man took my dad
for everything he had.

49
00:04:39,863 --> 00:04:43,449
He didn't handle it too well, so...

50
00:04:43,533 --> 00:04:48,287
Shot my mom.
Then he blew his own head off.

51
00:04:48,372 --> 00:04:52,208
I was hiding under the bed
when it happened. Heard the whole thing.

52
00:04:55,045 --> 00:04:57,129
- I'm sorry.
- Yeah.

53
00:04:59,549 --> 00:05:01,550
That was a year ago.

54
00:05:02,803 --> 00:05:06,639
- What?
- Right now it's July, 1977.

55
00:05:06,723 --> 00:05:08,808
Which means that happened last year.

56
00:05:10,978 --> 00:05:15,064
So I could have hopped on the sub,
gone back to the States,

57
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:20,903
walked right into my house and
stopped my daddy from killing anybody.

58
00:05:20,988 --> 00:05:23,072
Why didn't you?

59
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:25,074
Because, Jack...

60
00:05:27,494 --> 00:05:29,662
...what's done is done.

61
00:05:33,417 --> 00:05:35,084
It doesn't have to be that way.

62
00:05:37,587 --> 00:05:41,215
What did you screw up so bad the
first time, you'll blow up a damn nuke

63
00:05:41,299 --> 00:05:43,759
- for a second chance?
- Not what this is about.

64
00:05:43,844 --> 00:05:45,886
Then what is it about?

65
00:05:50,267 --> 00:05:55,271
Three years ago, Locke told me that
all this was happening for a reason.

66
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:59,859
- That us being here was our destiny.
- I don't speak destiny.

67
00:06:01,445 --> 00:06:04,113
What I do understand
is a man does what he does

68
00:06:04,197 --> 00:06:06,574
'cause he wants something for himself.

69
00:06:11,955 --> 00:06:14,123
What do you want, Jack?

70
00:06:22,716 --> 00:06:24,592
I had her.

71
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:29,263
I had her, and I lost her.

72
00:06:31,558 --> 00:06:33,642
Kate?

73
00:06:34,478 --> 00:06:37,396
Damn, doc, she's standing
on the other side of those trees.

74
00:06:37,481 --> 00:06:41,859
- You want her back, just ask her.
- No, it's too late for that.

75
00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:50,743
Your five minutes is up.

76
00:06:52,496 --> 00:06:55,915
Jack! If what you're doing even works,

77
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:59,919
you and Kate will be strangers.
And she'll be in damn handcuffs.

78
00:07:00,003 --> 00:07:02,671
What's meant to be is meant to be.

79
00:07:06,343 --> 00:07:09,553
I guess there's nothing I can say
that'll change your mind.

80
00:07:09,638 --> 00:07:11,388
I guess there's not.

81
00:07:13,183 --> 00:07:15,101
Who the hell do you think you are?!

82
00:07:28,323 --> 00:07:31,534
Think you can come here
and do whatever the hell you want?

83
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:33,285
I had a life here!

84
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:42,378
Sawyer, listen...

85
00:07:43,296 --> 00:07:44,672
You don't get it.

86
00:07:56,017 --> 00:07:57,643
Will you stop?

87
00:07:57,727 --> 00:08:00,229
- Will you stop?!
- No.

88
00:08:05,235 --> 00:08:06,777
James!

89
00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:11,574
- Let him go.
- He wouldn't listen.

90
00:08:11,658 --> 00:08:14,702
- I had to. He won't stop!
- That's because he's right.

91
00:08:16,121 --> 00:08:18,831
- What?
- He's right.

92
00:08:18,915 --> 00:08:21,167
James, we have to do this.

93
00:08:21,251 --> 00:08:23,752
What are you talking about?

94
00:08:23,837 --> 00:08:27,131
You're the one that told me
to come back here and stop him!

95
00:08:27,215 --> 00:08:28,382
What happened?!

96
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:32,678
I changed my mind.

97
00:08:59,331 --> 00:09:04,001
Girls, your dad and I have something
we need to talk to you both about.

98
00:09:04,085 --> 00:09:07,379
- Are we moving again?
- No, stupid.

99
00:09:07,464 --> 00:09:09,089
- They're getting a divorce.
- Rachel.

100
00:09:09,174 --> 00:09:10,424
Well, aren't you?

101
00:09:13,178 --> 00:09:16,222
- Yes.
- But we need you both to understand

102
00:09:16,306 --> 00:09:21,602
that your father and I,
we still love each other.

103
00:09:21,686 --> 00:09:25,856
Because people love each other doesn't
mean they're supposed to be together.

104
00:09:25,941 --> 00:09:30,861
- What if you are supposed to be?
- We're not, honey.

105
00:09:30,946 --> 00:09:33,489
- But how can you know for sure?
- We just know.

106
00:09:34,783 --> 00:09:37,701
And, when you're a grownup,

107
00:09:37,786 --> 00:09:39,745
you'll understand.

108
00:09:41,331 --> 00:09:43,415
I don't wanna understand!

109
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:47,211
- Juliet, wait!
- I don't wanna understand!

110
00:09:47,295 --> 00:09:50,464
- Stop! We gotta talk about this!
- There's nothing to talk about.

111
00:09:50,548 --> 00:09:53,968
- Let Jack do what he came here to do.
- Maybe you should have told me

112
00:09:54,052 --> 00:09:56,971
you had a change of heart before
I brought him out to kick his ass!

113
00:09:57,055 --> 00:09:58,305
- Would that have stopped you?
- No!

114
00:09:58,390 --> 00:10:02,226
- Glad you got it out of your system.
- Hey!

115
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:04,728
Don't!

116
00:10:04,813 --> 00:10:08,190
I need you to tell me
where all this is coming from.

117
00:10:08,275 --> 00:10:11,777
One minute, you're leading the
great sub escape, now you're onboard

118
00:10:11,861 --> 00:10:13,737
with blowing up the damn island?

119
00:10:15,073 --> 00:10:18,367
I got a right to know
why you changed your mind.

120
00:10:21,871 --> 00:10:24,373
I changed my mind
when I saw you look at her.

121
00:10:25,959 --> 00:10:29,378
Don't... Don't.

122
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:32,381
I don't care who I looked at.

123
00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:34,049
I'm with you.

124
00:10:35,719 --> 00:10:38,345
And you would stay
with me forever if I let you.

125
00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:41,432
And that is why I will always love you.

126
00:10:42,183 --> 00:10:45,477
What we had was just for a while.
Just because we love each other

127
00:10:45,562 --> 00:10:50,316
doesn't mean we're meant to be together.
Maybe we were never supposed to be.

128
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:55,237
So if Jack can make it that none of you
ever come here, then he should.

129
00:10:58,241 --> 00:11:00,117
Why are you doing this, Juliet?

130
00:11:06,082 --> 00:11:07,833
I...

131
00:11:11,004 --> 00:11:15,758
If I never meet you,
then I never have to lose you.

132
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:25,392
Slow down that drill.

133
00:11:25,935 --> 00:11:30,147
This has got to be...
It can't be like that.

134
00:11:30,231 --> 00:11:31,899
Radzinsky!

135
00:11:32,776 --> 00:11:35,694
- What is it now?
- Gauss readings jumped off the charts.

136
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:38,906
Let me see.

137
00:11:40,075 --> 00:11:44,370
- This is it. On top of the pocket.
- If we drill and hit that pocket,

138
00:11:44,454 --> 00:11:48,499
- all hell is gonna break loose.
- Radzinsky, are you there? Over.

139
00:11:48,583 --> 00:11:51,377
- Stuart, come in.
- What do you want, Phil?

140
00:11:51,461 --> 00:11:53,837
That Hostile
that shot the kid came back.

141
00:11:53,922 --> 00:11:57,591
- What the hell are you talking about?
- Here at the barracks.

142
00:11:57,675 --> 00:12:00,386
He attacked us and got rescued
by some other recruits.

143
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:03,389
- They stole a van and took off.
- Took off where?

144
00:12:03,473 --> 00:12:06,600
I don't know.
Roger said one of them had a bomb.

145
00:12:06,684 --> 00:12:10,187
That Hostile knows about the Swan.

146
00:12:10,271 --> 00:12:14,441
Get some men and some guns,
get your asses out here right now!

147
00:12:14,526 --> 00:12:16,735
If they're coming here, we'll be ready.

148
00:12:18,988 --> 00:12:20,447
Come on!

149
00:12:21,699 --> 00:12:23,450
Jack?

150
00:12:24,077 --> 00:12:25,119
What happened?

151
00:12:27,789 --> 00:12:29,832
My talk with Sawyer didn't go so good.

152
00:12:31,751 --> 00:12:33,669
- Does it hurt?
- It's OK.

153
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:35,462
OK.

154
00:12:42,429 --> 00:12:45,764
Do you remember when I sewed you up
when we first got here?

155
00:12:45,849 --> 00:12:47,516
Yeah.

156
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:50,477
Seems like a million years ago.

157
00:12:51,271 --> 00:12:53,105
Or 30 years from now.

158
00:13:03,867 --> 00:13:06,994
Kate, why did you make me promise
to never ask about Aaron?

159
00:13:11,207 --> 00:13:13,667
Because I was...

160
00:13:14,836 --> 00:13:17,921
...so angry with you
for making me come back here.

161
00:13:19,382 --> 00:13:21,675
Is he why you came back?

162
00:13:22,719 --> 00:13:25,512
I came back so he
could be where he belongs.

163
00:13:26,181 --> 00:13:29,600
- With his mother.
- If this works,

164
00:13:29,684 --> 00:13:32,811
Claire'll never come to the island.
They'll always be together,

165
00:13:32,896 --> 00:13:34,980
- the way they're meant to be.
- She was gonna give him up.

166
00:13:35,064 --> 00:13:38,317
You don't know what she'd do.
And, whatever it is,

167
00:13:38,401 --> 00:13:40,277
it would be her choice.

168
00:13:40,737 --> 00:13:44,448
If you wanna save Claire,
this is the only way to do it.

169
00:13:45,033 --> 00:13:49,161
But nothing... Nothing in my life
has ever felt so right.

170
00:13:50,038 --> 00:13:52,998
And...

171
00:13:53,082 --> 00:13:55,167
...I just need you to believe that.

172
00:14:05,386 --> 00:14:09,348
Keep cooling it! Don't let it get hot!

173
00:14:10,642 --> 00:14:14,144
- Keep the drill going!
- It's about to happen.

174
00:14:19,901 --> 00:14:21,652
Are you with me on this?

175
00:14:28,243 --> 00:14:30,577
- Yes.
- Then let's go.

176
00:14:37,502 --> 00:14:41,296
- ...two, three, four.
- Copy that.

177
00:14:42,173 --> 00:14:43,549
One wallet.

178
00:14:45,343 --> 00:14:47,970
Two hundred and 27 dollars cash.

179
00:14:49,055 --> 00:14:51,056
One ballpoint pen.

180
00:14:52,559 --> 00:14:53,767
One Fruit Roll-Up.

181
00:14:54,978 --> 00:14:58,355
- Sign here.
- You don't understand. It's a mistake.

182
00:14:58,439 --> 00:15:00,274
I killed a bunch of people.

183
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:04,945
You see this?
This is a discharge form.

184
00:15:05,029 --> 00:15:07,656
You've been cleared.
So take your stuff and go.

185
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:13,078
Look, dude, there are men
with tranquiliser guns

186
00:15:13,162 --> 00:15:16,415
hunting me down. They want to
bring me somewhere against my will.

187
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:19,334
There's a cab stand right out front.

188
00:15:28,261 --> 00:15:31,763
- Sorry. I didn't see it was taken.
- I'm only going a few blocks.

189
00:15:31,848 --> 00:15:33,932
- You want to share?
- Cool! You sure?

190
00:15:34,017 --> 00:15:35,517
Come on in.

191
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:46,987
- You want some? It's cherry.
- No, thanks.

192
00:15:49,365 --> 00:15:52,451
- What were you in for?
- Excuse me?

193
00:15:52,535 --> 00:15:56,538
Jail. I was there
'cause I killed three people.

194
00:15:56,623 --> 00:16:00,042
I didn't really.
Guess they figured it out.

195
00:16:00,126 --> 00:16:03,170
- What about you?
- I wasn't in jail.

196
00:16:04,839 --> 00:16:09,885
Then what were you doing
sitting outside a prison in a cab?

197
00:16:10,011 --> 00:16:12,179
I was waiting for you, Hugo.

198
00:16:16,059 --> 00:16:19,519
- Then you must be dead.
- I'm definitely not dead.

199
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:23,982
What do you want from me?

200
00:16:25,193 --> 00:16:27,569
I wanna know why
you won't go back to the island.

201
00:16:34,911 --> 00:16:38,080
- 'Cause I'm cursed.
- Is that so?

202
00:16:40,583 --> 00:16:42,668
That's why the plane crashed,

203
00:16:42,752 --> 00:16:46,505
my friends died, Libby, Charlie.

204
00:16:46,589 --> 00:16:50,092
Now they visit me,
and I can't make it stop.

205
00:16:51,803 --> 00:16:54,596
What if you weren't cursed?

206
00:16:54,681 --> 00:16:58,016
- What if you were blessed?
- How do you mean, blessed?

207
00:16:58,101 --> 00:17:02,729
Well, you get to talk to
the people you've lost.

208
00:17:02,814 --> 00:17:06,024
- Seems like a wonderful thing to me.
- Sure, it's wonderful

209
00:17:06,109 --> 00:17:10,445
- except for the part where I'm crazy.
- I've got some news for you, Hugo.

210
00:17:10,530 --> 00:17:13,198
You're just gonna have to
take my word on this.

211
00:17:13,282 --> 00:17:15,242
You are not crazy.

212
00:17:22,083 --> 00:17:25,252
- Who are you, dude?
- I'm just up here on the corner.

213
00:17:28,631 --> 00:17:32,551
Ajira Airways, flight 316 out of LAX.
Leaves in 24 hours.

214
00:17:32,635 --> 00:17:37,139
All you have to do is be on that plane.
It's your choice, Hugo.

215
00:17:38,433 --> 00:17:40,642
You don't have to do anything
you don't want to.

216
00:17:45,398 --> 00:17:49,568
- Wait! You forgot your guitar.
- It's not my guitar.

217
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:58,702
Don't worry, dude. Everything'll be fine
when Jack changes the future.

218
00:17:59,412 --> 00:18:02,497
Or the past. One of those.

219
00:18:03,624 --> 00:18:06,334
I don't think
your buddy's gonna make it.

220
00:18:06,461 --> 00:18:07,502
He'll make it.

221
00:18:09,464 --> 00:18:13,175
- Dude, what happened to your face?
- Nothing.

222
00:18:14,677 --> 00:18:19,097
We were just up on a ridge where
we could look down into the Swan site.

223
00:18:19,182 --> 00:18:22,976
Something just happened down there.
They hit something.

224
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:27,022
- It's time for me to go.
- It's all set to go.

225
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:29,566
Remember, be careful.

226
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:32,235
It's rigged to explode on impact.

227
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:36,114
According to Faraday's plan, you must
get the bomb as close as you can

228
00:18:36,199 --> 00:18:39,034
to the source of electromagnetism.

229
00:18:40,328 --> 00:18:42,746
Sayid, this is gonna work.

230
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:44,623
And it'll save you.

231
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,126
Nothing can save me.

232
00:19:38,886 --> 00:19:40,720
See you in Los Angeles.

233
00:20:06,247 --> 00:20:09,749
What is it? Why are we stopping?

234
00:20:10,751 --> 00:20:12,419
You'll see.

235
00:20:33,399 --> 00:20:36,985
Well, it's a wonderful foot, Richard,
but what's it have to do with Jacob?

236
00:20:38,195 --> 00:20:39,738
It's where he lives.

237
00:21:11,062 --> 00:21:12,729
Oh, my God!

238
00:21:21,906 --> 00:21:24,574
Oh, my God! Call 911!

239
00:21:38,589 --> 00:21:40,757
Don't worry,
everything's gonna be all right.

240
00:21:45,596 --> 00:21:47,889
I'm sorry this happened to you.

241
00:22:12,081 --> 00:22:14,290
Are you sure you need to do this?

242
00:22:14,834 --> 00:22:17,502
If you waited,
Jacob would come to you, John.

243
00:22:17,586 --> 00:22:19,587
I'm tired of waiting.

244
00:22:20,589 --> 00:22:22,173
Where is he, Richard?

245
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:32,726
What happened to the rest of the statue?

246
00:22:34,437 --> 00:22:36,896
I don't know.
It was like that when I got here.

247
00:22:37,773 --> 00:22:39,816
Do you expect me to believe that?

248
00:22:42,278 --> 00:22:44,279
Not really.

249
00:22:45,156 --> 00:22:46,573
All right, Ben. Let's go.

250
00:22:58,836 --> 00:23:00,336
What are you doing?

251
00:23:02,506 --> 00:23:05,216
- John wants me to join him.
- You can't bring him in.

252
00:23:05,301 --> 00:23:07,552
- Why not?
- Only our leader can request

253
00:23:07,636 --> 00:23:10,722
an audience with Jacob.
There can only be one leader at a time.

254
00:23:10,806 --> 00:23:15,310
I'm beginning to think you just
make these rules up as you go along.

255
00:23:15,394 --> 00:23:20,106
Ben is coming in with me. If that's
a problem, Jacob and I can work it out.

256
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:55,058
Tell him I said hello.

257
00:24:29,426 --> 00:24:31,261
Will you be able to do this, Ben?

258
00:24:33,222 --> 00:24:38,434
I know it won't be easy,
but things will change once he's gone.

259
00:24:44,441 --> 00:24:45,441
I promise.

260
00:25:16,390 --> 00:25:19,767
- Can I ask you something, LaFleur?
- There ain't no more LaFleur.

261
00:25:19,894 --> 00:25:23,396
- Go ahead, shoot.
- Has it occurred to any of you

262
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:27,692
that your buddy's actually gonna
cause the thing he's trying to prevent?

263
00:25:30,321 --> 00:25:34,157
Perhaps that little nuke
is the incident.

264
00:25:34,575 --> 00:25:38,244
So maybe the best thing to do
is nothing.

265
00:25:42,249 --> 00:25:44,042
I'm glad you all thought this through.

266
00:25:49,506 --> 00:25:52,550
- What's going on?
- It's Phil.

267
00:25:52,635 --> 00:25:55,136
That's the road to the Swan.

268
00:25:55,221 --> 00:25:57,680
If they see Jack, they'll kill him.

269
00:25:59,266 --> 00:26:01,643
What do you think, blondie?

270
00:26:04,647 --> 00:26:06,856
Live together and die alone.

271
00:26:10,152 --> 00:26:12,362
Still running pretty hot.

272
00:26:20,621 --> 00:26:23,081
- Good for you. You got here fast.
- Any sign of them?

273
00:26:23,165 --> 00:26:24,499
Not yet. You got time
to set up a perimeter.

274
00:26:24,583 --> 00:26:28,586
- Did you call these men to the site?
- You, rear. You, top.

275
00:26:28,671 --> 00:26:33,508
- We need to get people away from here!
- Top of the scaffolding. Go, now!

276
00:27:08,294 --> 00:27:09,752
There!

277
00:27:13,215 --> 00:27:14,632
Go, go, over there!

278
00:27:20,514 --> 00:27:21,806
Get him!

279
00:27:24,685 --> 00:27:26,144
Flank him! Get him now!

280
00:27:32,401 --> 00:27:33,526
Who's this?!

281
00:28:13,192 --> 00:28:16,402
Drop it, Phil, or you're a dead man.
Tell 'em to put the guns down!

282
00:28:16,487 --> 00:28:18,154
Drop the guns! Drop the guns!

283
00:28:21,367 --> 00:28:23,076
You can come out now, doc!

284
00:28:31,293 --> 00:28:33,503
Hurry up and do your business.

285
00:28:37,383 --> 00:28:38,800
Turn that damn thing off!

286
00:28:44,932 --> 00:28:46,307
What's the matter?

287
00:28:47,726 --> 00:28:50,186
- It won't shut down!
- Why not?

288
00:28:50,270 --> 00:28:53,815
- Something's pulling the drill down!
- We hit the pocket!

289
00:29:04,410 --> 00:29:07,328
Hurry up, doc!
What are you waiting for? Drop it!

290
00:30:02,468 --> 00:30:06,429
This don't look like LAX.

291
00:30:35,751 --> 00:30:37,251
Dad!

292
00:30:43,884 --> 00:30:45,092
Jack!

293
00:30:55,479 --> 00:30:58,940
Get away from here!
Get as far away from here as you can!

294
00:31:00,651 --> 00:31:04,445
- Get in! What the hell's going on?
- Let's get out of here!

295
00:31:10,619 --> 00:31:12,036
Go, go, go!

296
00:31:20,003 --> 00:31:22,088
Hey, LaFleur!

297
00:31:34,351 --> 00:31:35,768
- Help!
- Juliet!

298
00:31:39,982 --> 00:31:42,108
Come on! Sawyer, help!

299
00:31:42,192 --> 00:31:43,651
Juliet!

300
00:31:56,957 --> 00:31:58,958
Where do you think you're going?

301
00:32:02,546 --> 00:32:05,798
Kate! Help me get those chains off!

302
00:32:09,177 --> 00:32:11,262
Hold on. You hold on!

303
00:32:11,346 --> 00:32:14,599
- I can't! I can't get it off!
- I got you.

304
00:32:15,809 --> 00:32:17,768
I can't!

305
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:25,651
- I can't reach her!
- You hold on!

306
00:32:31,116 --> 00:32:32,575
I got you.

307
00:32:34,328 --> 00:32:35,620
Sawyer!

308
00:32:41,376 --> 00:32:44,253
- Don't you leave me.
- It's OK.

309
00:32:44,338 --> 00:32:45,671
Don't you leave me!

310
00:32:46,882 --> 00:32:49,091
- I love you!
- No, you don't let go!

311
00:32:49,176 --> 00:32:51,052
- I love you, James.
- No!

312
00:32:51,136 --> 00:32:55,097
- I love you so much!
- No! No, don't let go!

313
00:32:56,183 --> 00:32:58,976
Juliet! No!

314
00:33:23,085 --> 00:33:26,712
- Water?
- Do you have any alcohol?

315
00:33:27,839 --> 00:33:30,049
No. Sure wish I did.

316
00:33:39,184 --> 00:33:40,685
Don't shoot.

317
00:33:41,687 --> 00:33:42,937
It's OK.

318
00:33:44,856 --> 00:33:46,273
It's all right.

319
00:33:54,116 --> 00:33:55,741
Which one of you is Ricardos?

320
00:34:04,584 --> 00:34:06,544
It's Richard, actually.

321
00:34:08,755 --> 00:34:10,715
What lies in the shadow of the statue?

322
00:34:23,353 --> 00:34:26,147
Richard. I'm Ilana.

323
00:34:28,442 --> 00:34:30,484
I have something you need to see.

324
00:34:30,986 --> 00:34:32,319
Open it up.

325
00:34:32,404 --> 00:34:35,281
It's OK. It's OK. Let them.

326
00:35:07,272 --> 00:35:10,149
- Where did you find him?
- In the cargo hold of the plane

327
00:35:10,233 --> 00:35:11,609
we came here on.

328
00:35:14,488 --> 00:35:16,322
In a coffin.

329
00:35:20,452 --> 00:35:22,870
I don't understand.

330
00:35:23,538 --> 00:35:27,958
If this is Locke, who's in there?

331
00:36:28,186 --> 00:36:29,395
You like it?

332
00:36:32,983 --> 00:36:34,608
I did it myself.

333
00:36:38,822 --> 00:36:41,657
Takes a very long time
when you're making the thread,

334
00:36:41,741 --> 00:36:46,036
but I suppose that's the point,
isn't it?

335
00:36:47,747 --> 00:36:49,290
Hello, Jacob.

336
00:36:53,587 --> 00:36:55,421
You found your loophole.

337
00:36:57,215 --> 00:36:58,799
Indeed I did.

338
00:37:04,723 --> 00:37:07,057
And you have no idea

339
00:37:07,142 --> 00:37:09,602
what I've gone through

340
00:37:09,686 --> 00:37:11,520
to be here.

341
00:37:15,609 --> 00:37:19,403
- Have you met before?
- In a manner of speaking.

342
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:27,244
Do what I asked you to, Ben.

343
00:37:31,833 --> 00:37:36,295
Benjamin, whatever he's told you,

344
00:37:36,379 --> 00:37:38,756
I want you to understand one thing.

345
00:37:41,551 --> 00:37:43,594
You have a choice.

346
00:37:47,557 --> 00:37:49,391
What choice?

347
00:37:50,018 --> 00:37:54,313
You can do what he asks, or you can go.

348
00:37:55,523 --> 00:37:59,652
Leave us to discuss our... issues.

349
00:38:05,367 --> 00:38:08,702
So now, after all this time,

350
00:38:10,205 --> 00:38:13,082
you've decided to stop ignoring me.

351
00:38:15,794 --> 00:38:19,546
Thirty-five years
I lived on this island.

352
00:38:19,631 --> 00:38:25,052
And all I ever heard was your name,
over and over.

353
00:38:25,136 --> 00:38:29,598
Richard would bring me your
instructions, all those slips of paper.

354
00:38:29,683 --> 00:38:32,184
All those lists.

355
00:38:33,603 --> 00:38:36,897
And I never questioned anything.

356
00:38:36,982 --> 00:38:39,942
I did as I was told.

357
00:38:42,487 --> 00:38:46,782
But when I dared to ask
to see you myself,

358
00:38:46,866 --> 00:38:50,703
I was told, "You have to wait.

359
00:38:50,787 --> 00:38:53,580
You have to be patient."

360
00:38:55,417 --> 00:38:59,336
But when he asked to see you,

361
00:38:59,421 --> 00:39:04,383
he gets marched straight up here
as if he was Moses.

362
00:39:10,724 --> 00:39:12,808
So why him?

363
00:39:20,525 --> 00:39:23,444
What was it that was so wrong with me?

364
00:39:28,783 --> 00:39:30,993
What about me?

365
00:39:34,330 --> 00:39:36,457
What about you?

366
00:39:46,134 --> 00:39:47,801
Well...

367
00:39:58,646 --> 00:40:01,857
- They're coming.
- What?

368
00:40:04,152 --> 00:40:05,569
I can't hear you.

369
00:40:05,653 --> 00:40:07,613
They're coming.

370
00:40:30,386 --> 00:40:34,973
- Juliet!
- Sawyer, get off of there!

371
00:40:35,058 --> 00:40:38,185
You have to come out!

372
00:40:41,106 --> 00:40:43,607
It's going down! This thing is gonna go!

373
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:47,861
You have to go,
this thing is gonna go at any second.

374
00:40:47,946 --> 00:40:50,739
Jack! Jack, help me get him off of here.

375
00:42:07,317 --> 00:42:09,067
Come on!

376
00:42:15,033 --> 00:42:18,827
Come on! Come on, you son of a bitch!
