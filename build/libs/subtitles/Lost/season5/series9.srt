1
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:28,760
wanna hear something crazy?

2
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:31,560
What's that?

3
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:34,700
did you see the big guy
when we got on in L.A.?

4
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:38,420
Sitting in first class,
curly hair, guitar case?

5
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:39,950
What about him?

6
00:00:40,010 --> 00:00:42,550
He's one of the oceanic six.

7
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:44,430
Guy's got nerves of steel, man.

8
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:47,130
He survives a full-on
mmercial airliner crash.

9
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:49,730
Now he's back flying over
the same south pacific?

10
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:52,000
Yeah, well...

11
00:00:52,030 --> 00:00:55,590
maybe he doesn't believe that lightning
will strike twice in the same place.

12
00:01:07,940 --> 00:01:10,030
you all right there, frank?

13
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:12,270
I'm just fine.

14
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:24,350
dude... you might wanna
fasten your seat belt.

15
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:28,760
oh, no.

16
00:01:29,030 --> 00:01:30,900
What?

17
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:41,440
autopilot off!

18
00:01:41,450 --> 00:01:42,510
I got the controls.

19
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,830
Autopilot off. You have the controls.

20
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:53,590
pull that rudder!

21
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:07,910
what? What?

22
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:11,410
- stall. Stall.
- We've lost power!

23
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:13,220
- Stall.
- Restarting one.

24
00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:14,950
Restarting two.

25
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:17,380
Altimeter reads 650.

26
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:21,060
oh, my god.

27
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:23,850
Give me more power! I
can pull us out of this!

28
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:25,970
- You're gonna rip us apart!
- Do it!

29
00:02:29,890 --> 00:02:32,820
Come on. Come on.

30
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:43,420
is that a runway?

31
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:45,810
massive instrument failure!
We're puttin' her down!

32
00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:48,490
Mayday! Mayday! Mayday!
This is ajira 3-1-6!

33
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:50,960
Mayday! Mayday! Mayday!

34
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:53,140
- 50... 60...
- full flaps!

35
00:02:53,150 --> 00:02:55,720
Gear down! Airspeed 190!

36
00:02:57,110 --> 00:02:59,450
we're coming in too steep!

37
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:10,370
reverse thruers!

38
00:03:12,790 --> 00:03:14,540
Come on!

39
00:03:14,550 --> 00:03:16,810
We're runnin' out! We're runnin' out!

40
00:03:17,090 --> 00:03:18,330
Hold on!

41
00:03:18,370 --> 00:03:20,680
Brace for impact!

42
00:03:56,350 --> 00:03:58,840
Hey, lady. Are you okay?

43
00:03:58,850 --> 00:04:01,520
- Jarrah?
- No. My name is caesar.

44
00:04:01,530 --> 00:04:04,750
We had an accident. But we're okay now.

45
00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:23,750
- frank?
- Sun.

46
00:04:25,290 --> 00:04:26,080
you all right?

47
00:04:26,110 --> 00:04:28,020
Oh, my god. What happened?

48
00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:30,010
I don't know.

49
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:36,850
Where's everyo else?

50
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:41,030
Jack and... kate and
hurley-- where'd they go?

51
00:04:41,370 --> 00:04:43,250
they're gone.

52
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:50,130
gone? Gone where?

53
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:53,760
How would I know?

54
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:01,580
********

55
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:37,350
you're alive.

56
00:05:39,350 --> 00:05:42,650
Dude! I can't believe it!

57
00:05:45,590 --> 00:05:48,720
- easy on the ribs there, kong.
- "Kong."

58
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:52,630
- I actually missed that.
- I missed you, too, hugo.

59
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:55,090
Sawyer.

60
00:05:55,630 --> 00:05:57,630
Doc.

61
00:06:06,110 --> 00:06:08,010
Good to see you, kate.

62
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:10,690
You, too, james.

63
00:06:20,140 --> 00:06:22,130
you're really here.

64
00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:23,490
Son of a bitch actually did it!

65
00:06:23,510 --> 00:06:25,890
Locke said he was gonna
bring you back, but...

66
00:06:27,610 --> 00:06:29,480
where is he?

67
00:06:33,530 --> 00:06:35,260
John's dead.

68
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:42,410
Dead? How?

69
00:06:43,730 --> 00:06:45,990
Doesn't matter. He's gone.

70
00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:50,920
So what's up with you guys
and the old dharma jumpsuits?

71
00:06:53,090 --> 00:06:55,200
You didn't tell 'em?

72
00:06:55,210 --> 00:06:57,400
No. I was waiting for you.

73
00:06:57,410 --> 00:06:59,990
Tell us what?

74
00:07:05,650 --> 00:07:07,970
We're in the dharma initiative.

75
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:10,410
They came back to the island?

76
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:13,920
No. We came back.

77
00:07:14,930 --> 00:07:17,340
And so did you.

78
00:07:18,150 --> 00:07:20,680
It's 1977.

79
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:27,040
what?

83
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:46,450
so you're telling me
that you've been here,

84
00:07:46,470 --> 00:07:49,610
living with the dharma initiative
for the past three years?

85
00:07:49,630 --> 00:07:51,060
That's right.

86
00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:53,300
How long's it been for
you since the chopper?

87
00:07:53,310 --> 00:07:54,930
Three years.

88
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:57,980
hey, jin, this is miles.
Where are you? Over.

89
00:07:58,630 --> 00:08:01,430
if I don't report in soon,
they'll send out a patrol.

90
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,250
What should we do with them?

91
00:08:05,570 --> 00:08:07,840
Dude, your english is awesome.

92
00:08:07,850 --> 00:08:09,680
What we do is we bring 'em in.

93
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:10,980
Bring us in where?

94
00:08:11,010 --> 00:08:12,630
Back to the barracks at dharmaville.

95
00:08:12,670 --> 00:08:15,150
You can't be wandering around
in the jungle with the hostiles.

96
00:08:15,170 --> 00:08:17,110
"The hostiles"?

97
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:17,790
The others.

98
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:20,460
What about everyone else from the
plane? They could still be out there.

99
00:08:20,770 --> 00:08:22,810
What do you mean, everyone else?

100
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:25,140
We didn't come back alone.

101
00:08:25,610 --> 00:08:28,430
Sayid was on the plane, too. Lapidus...

102
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:32,000
and sun.

103
00:08:33,570 --> 00:08:36,050
Jin! Hold up! Where you goin'?

104
00:08:36,060 --> 00:08:37,320
The flame.

105
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:40,010
If a plane landed on the
island, radzinsky will know.

106
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:42,700
hold on! We gotta think about this!

107
00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:50,640
all righ that's it.

108
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:52,790
Listen, you guys gotta stay put.

109
00:08:52,830 --> 00:08:57,770
Don't go nowhere, don't do nothing till I can figure
out how the hell to explain where you came from.

110
00:08:58,890 --> 00:09:01,130
Sawyer, wait.

111
00:09:01,410 --> 00:09:04,050
Other than you and jin,
who else is still here?

112
00:09:12,470 --> 00:09:15,140
Miles, have you seen james?

113
00:09:15,150 --> 00:09:16,520
Nope.

114
00:09:16,540 --> 00:09:19,110
He's not answering his walkie, either.

115
00:09:20,090 --> 00:09:25,620
Jin called him this morning, then he just
ran off without telling me what was going on.

116
00:09:26,150 --> 00:09:28,940
Well, let's see what we've got.

117
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,640
hang on. There he is.

118
00:09:50,210 --> 00:09:53,080
You seen my baggy sweatshirt,
the one with the bulldog on it?

119
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:55,960
It's in the laundry. James...

120
00:09:56,830 --> 00:09:59,480
- what's going on?
- They're back.

121
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,200
I'm sorry. Who's back?

122
00:10:04,350 --> 00:10:06,660
Jack, hurley, kate.

123
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:10,010
What?

124
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:12,240
I know.

125
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,570
They came back, juliet.

126
00:10:16,970 --> 00:10:19,120
Are they here now?

127
00:10:19,470 --> 00:10:22,990
They're out at the north point,
waitin' for me to tell 'em what to do.

128
00:10:24,850 --> 00:10:26,350
how did they get...

129
00:10:26,370 --> 00:10:28,780
I'm not sure. They said
they were on a plane.

130
00:10:40,690 --> 00:10:43,850
I don't understand it
any more than you do.

131
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:49,010
But they're here, and I gotta find a way to
bring 'em in before somebody else finds 'em

132
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:51,780
and they screw up
everything we got here.

133
00:10:55,960 --> 00:11:00,080
There's, um, a sub
coming in this afternoon.

134
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:28,210
hey, you understand
the concept of knocking?

135
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:39,220
oh, get your hands off that!

136
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:42,120
I thought you learned
english. I said, hands off!

137
00:11:42,130 --> 00:11:46,700
Nobody handles any of the gear in
this station except me. Understand?

138
00:11:46,710 --> 00:11:49,630
I need to check the radar logs.

139
00:11:50,780 --> 00:11:52,570
- For what?
- Please.

140
00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:55,860
I need to know if a plane
landed on the island.

141
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:58,310
If a plane landed? Here?

142
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,280
Yes.

143
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:06,280
What, so you think if a plane landed on our
island, I'd be over there just building my model?

144
00:12:06,310 --> 00:12:09,620
That I wouldn't have called anyone?
That I wouldn't have put out an alert?

145
00:12:09,630 --> 00:12:11,250
Maybe you missed it.

146
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:12,400
Can you check with the other stations?

147
00:12:12,430 --> 00:12:15,670
I just told you
I would not be--

148
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:20,080
check with the other stations.

149
00:12:31,930 --> 00:12:35,800
attention all stations, this is a system-wide
broadcast from radzinsky at the flame.

150
00:12:35,810 --> 00:12:39,410
I'm checking in to see if anyone's
seen an airplane over the island.

151
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:44,010
no one else has seen an airplane, but if you
have, could you call in to me, please? Over.

152
00:12:47,390 --> 00:12:50,340
so what are you all hot
and bothered about, kwon?

153
00:12:50,350 --> 00:12:53,630
Why is this plane so damn important?

154
00:12:55,460 --> 00:12:57,920
It just is.

155
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:23,930
did you lose someone?

156
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:26,000
Excuse me?

157
00:13:26,030 --> 00:13:27,230
I just saw you looking around.

158
00:13:27,260 --> 00:13:30,210
I thought maybe you lost
someone on the plane.

159
00:13:30,570 --> 00:13:34,610
No. I was traveling alone.

160
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:37,220
can I get everybody's attention?

161
00:13:38,830 --> 00:13:41,120
Everybody, please!

162
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:46,890
Listen up, folks!

163
00:13:47,090 --> 00:13:48,920
Here's where we're at.

164
00:13:48,950 --> 00:13:52,910
The radio's dead, so I haven't
been able to call in our situation.

165
00:13:52,950 --> 00:13:54,230
But that's all right.

166
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:59,050
Soon as they figure out we're not where we're
supposed to be, they'll come looking for us.

167
00:13:59,470 --> 00:14:03,400
So best thing to do right
now is just stick together.

168
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:06,840
Stick together, hunker down and
just wait till help gets here.

169
00:14:06,870 --> 00:14:08,660
- And where is here?
- What's that?

170
00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:12,070
Where is here? What is this place?

171
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:17,410
I don't know where "here" is because
this island's not on my charts.

172
00:14:17,610 --> 00:14:20,510
- Really
- really.

173
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:24,310
Because there are some buildings
over there... and animal cages.

174
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:29,550
Down the beach, you can see a
bigger island across the water.

175
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:34,020
So maybe you should get some new charts.

176
00:14:34,030 --> 00:14:37,400
right now, I'm just trying
to keep everyone here safe.

177
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:40,400
So let's gather up some firewood.

178
00:14:40,410 --> 00:14:42,930
if he wants to wait, let him!

179
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:45,350
I say we search these buildings!

180
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:49,610
Maybe they have a radio or some food!

181
00:14:51,910 --> 00:14:54,140
Who wants to help me?

182
00:15:29,510 --> 00:15:31,580
Why are you following me?

183
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:37,410
Where are you going?

184
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:39,970
Back to our island.

185
00:15:41,790 --> 00:15:44,040
You wanna come?

186
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:55,770
Juliet?

187
00:15:56,380 --> 00:15:59,800
Hey, amy. I'm sorry. I
didn't mean to wake you.

188
00:15:59,810 --> 00:16:01,560
Oh, no, it's fine.

189
00:16:01,580 --> 00:16:04,090
I just came to get the sub manifest.

190
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:08,110
- obviously, I don't want you working today.
- Thank you.

191
00:16:10,230 --> 00:16:12,270
- Full load?
- Almost.

192
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:15,180
Two of the recruits dropped
out in the eleventh hour.

193
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:17,720
They didn't want to take
the sedative for the trip.

194
00:16:18,260 --> 00:16:20,540
Can you tell pierre for me?

195
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:26,260
Oh, hello, little one.

196
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:30,730
Have you and horace decided on a name?

197
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:32,520
Yeah, we have.

198
00:16:32,530 --> 00:16:35,170
We're gonna name him ethan.

199
00:16:42,470 --> 00:16:44,440
oh, hey, buddy.

200
00:16:47,530 --> 00:16:51,330
So... when are you and jim
gonna have one of these?

201
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:53,900
I don't know.

202
00:16:54,870 --> 00:16:57,350
Timing's gotta be right.

203
00:17:07,820 --> 00:17:09,990
so the woman who told
you how to come back...

204
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:12,530
did she mention that it
would be 30 years ago?

205
00:17:13,970 --> 00:17:16,960
No. No, she left that part out.

206
00:17:19,890 --> 00:17:22,450
So what are we supposed to do now?

207
00:17:25,010 --> 00:17:27,250
I'm not sure yet.

208
00:17:27,610 --> 00:17:29,720
sawyer's back!

209
00:17:43,290 --> 00:17:44,390
all right, listen.

210
00:17:44,420 --> 00:17:48,240
Y'all are gonna be thcond batch of recruits comin'
in off the sub pullin' into port right about now,

211
00:17:48,260 --> 00:17:50,990
so we ain't got much
time. Nice suit, doc.

212
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,050
Not exactly island wear. Try this.

213
00:17:54,730 --> 00:17:58,030
You want us to say we came in on
the sub. How's that gonna work?

214
00:17:58,040 --> 00:18:01,970
Everyone gets knocked out before the trip, so
no one meets each other until we process 'em.

215
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:06,010
Look, we need to find the rest
of the people from the plane.

216
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:07,970
If there was a plane, jin will find it.

217
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:12,290
So we got about ten minutes to make intake, or y'all
are gonna be camping in the jungle for a long time.

218
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:15,180
There ain't another batch of
recruits due in for six months.

219
00:18:17,710 --> 00:18:19,980
What do you think?

220
00:18:19,990 --> 00:18:21,650
I think we should listeno sawyer.

221
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:23,460
I vote for not camping.

222
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:27,200
Trust me. Do what I say.
Everything will be fine.

223
00:18:29,470 --> 00:18:31,550
Let's move.

224
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:39,700
I just heard from the looking glass.

225
00:18:39,730 --> 00:18:41,640
They were the last station to check in.

226
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:44,360
They got nothing but an incoming sub.

227
00:18:46,170 --> 00:18:49,650
Why don't you go home, and I'll
call you if something happens?

228
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:55,640
move. Move. Out of my way.

229
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:58,090
those bastards.

230
00:18:58,120 --> 00:18:58,990
What do you see?

231
00:18:59,030 --> 00:19:01,520
Grid 325. Motion sensor
alarm was tripped.

232
00:19:01,530 --> 00:19:04,030
We got a hostile inside the perimeter.

233
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:08,710
Where you going?

234
00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:42,580
Stop right there!

235
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:52,970
Sayid?

236
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,200
Jin?

237
00:19:57,030 --> 00:19:58,930
where's sun?

238
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:03,570
- I don't know.
- shut up!

239
00:20:06,410 --> 00:20:08,160
Get down!

240
00:20:08,710 --> 00:20:11,600
Say another word, and you're dead.

241
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:24,420
Okay, so it's 1977.

242
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,270
Yep.

243
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:29,640
And... you guys are all members
of the dharma initiative.

244
00:20:30,820 --> 00:20:32,740
Yep.

245
00:20:34,330 --> 00:20:37,490
Well, you do realize
thosdudes get wiped out, right?

246
00:20:38,230 --> 00:20:40,400
I mean, I saw the pit where
all the bodies got dumped.

247
00:20:40,430 --> 00:20:42,450
- What about it?
- Well, aren't you gonna warn 'em?

248
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:44,780
Aren't you gonna stop it from happening?

249
00:20:44,810 --> 00:20:47,310
I ain't here to play
nostradamus to these people.

250
00:20:47,330 --> 00:20:51,630
Besides, faraday's got some interesting
theories on what we can and can't do here.

251
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:53,900
Did you say faraday? He's here?

252
00:20:56,050 --> 00:20:58,160
Not anymore.

253
00:21:06,620 --> 00:21:12,040
recruits will be going
inside for processing,

254
00:21:12,330 --> 00:21:16,040
where you'll be given your
work assignment and lodging.

255
00:21:27,950 --> 00:21:29,590
put these on and listen up.

256
00:21:29,650 --> 00:21:32,390
Juliet's got it worked out so your
name's gonna be on the list, all right?

257
00:21:32,420 --> 00:21:35,020
So when you get in there, just watch
the little meet and greet video,

258
00:21:35,030 --> 00:21:36,560
wait for 'em to call your name.

259
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:40,490
When they do, just smile, step up, take
your jumpsuits and work assignments.

260
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:42,650
- Work assignments?
- Yeah, don't worry. I got it covered.

261
00:21:42,660 --> 00:21:45,290
Just remembeto act a little doped up,
'cause you just woke up from the sub.

262
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:49,330
What if they start asking us questions we
can't answer, like, uh, who's president in 1977?

263
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:51,620
It's not a damn game show, hugo.

264
00:21:51,630 --> 00:21:54,400
Besides, I'm gonna be in there
to get your backs, all right?

265
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:59,100
Let's move.

266
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:16,490
lafleur! Where have you been?

267
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:18,640
I've been trying to
reach you on the walkie.

268
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:24,040
what--what the hell
are they doing here?

269
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:26,300
They're our new inductees.

270
00:22:26,310 --> 00:22:27,430
I'll explain everything later.

271
00:22:27,460 --> 00:22:30,080
stop staring and tell me
what your damn problem is.

272
00:22:30,090 --> 00:22:32,530
'S, uh... it's jin.

273
00:22:32,540 --> 00:22:34,810
There's a fourteen-j at the flame.

274
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:38,570
What? jin, you there?

275
00:22:39,430 --> 00:22:42,280
james, we have a problem.
We found a hostile.

276
00:22:42,290 --> 00:22:44,450
what? What do you mean
you found a hostile? Where?

277
00:22:46,290 --> 00:22:48,160
he was wandering in the jungle.

278
00:22:48,180 --> 00:22:49,710
Radzinksy's taking care of him now.

279
00:22:49,750 --> 00:22:52,800
What's he doing in our territory?
It's a violation of the truce.

280
00:22:56,410 --> 00:22:58,900
- it's sayid.
- what?

281
00:22:58,910 --> 00:23:01,500
Son of a bitch!

282
00:23:02,170 --> 00:23:03,580
was anyone else with him?

283
00:23:03,590 --> 00:23:05,760
No. He was alone.

284
00:23:17,330 --> 00:23:18,970
wait!

285
00:23:19,730 --> 00:23:21,910
I'm sorry, sun, but waiting
doesn't interest me much right now.

286
00:23:21,930 --> 00:23:24,250
There are three outriggers
near here. I'm gonna take one.

287
00:23:24,260 --> 00:23:26,820
So you can come along and help me row...

288
00:23:28,350 --> 00:23:30,510
or you can stay here.

289
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:33,030
Frankly, it make no difference to me.

290
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:35,600
- Why are you leaving?
- Why are you staying?

291
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,360
The main island...

292
00:23:39,850 --> 00:23:42,550
is that where jin is?

293
00:23:43,470 --> 00:23:45,670
Honestly, I don't know.

294
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:48,140
But that's where I'd start looking.

295
00:23:49,770 --> 00:23:53,350
- sun!
- Over here!

296
00:23:57,350 --> 00:23:59,260
Hello, frank.

297
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:01,460
you all right?

298
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:03,520
Yes, I'm fine.

299
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:06,150
I got worried when I couldn't find ya.

300
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:08,210
I saw him leaving.

301
00:24:08,220 --> 00:24:10,150
What are you doing out here?

302
00:24:14,650 --> 00:24:17,090
Ben knows where there's a boat.

303
00:24:17,510 --> 00:24:20,200
I'm going back to the
main island with him.

304
00:24:23,730 --> 00:24:26,520
You don't think you can
really trust this guy, do ya?

305
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:35,360
I have to trust him.

306
00:24:55,990 --> 00:24:57,830
- you ready?
- Yes.

307
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:00,750
Sun. I want you to think about is, okay?

308
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:03,020
This guy is dangerous.

309
00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:09,240
Sun, that boat I came here on-- it was filled
with commandos whose only mission was to get him.

310
00:25:09,250 --> 00:25:11,690
And how'd that work out for everyone?

311
00:25:14,830 --> 00:25:17,030
Don't do it.

312
00:25:18,770 --> 00:25:20,190
Why don't you come with us?

313
00:25:20,220 --> 00:25:22,530
I can'T. I got a group of
people I gotta look after.

314
00:25:22,540 --> 00:25:24,230
That's right, frank.

315
00:25:24,260 --> 00:25:27,510
A captain's first responsibility
is to his passengers.

316
00:25:28,270 --> 00:25:30,350
T I have people I have
to take care of, too.

317
00:25:30,380 --> 00:25:33,560
There's a small dock about a half
mile due south across the water.

318
00:25:33,590 --> 00:25:36,900
It leads directly to a town where I
used to live. There are resources there.

319
00:25:37,180 --> 00:25:41,390
So if anyone can help you and the rest
of the plane get out of here safely, it--

320
00:25:49,470 --> 00:25:51,810
I thought you trusted this guy.

321
00:25:53,290 --> 00:25:55,160
I lied.

322
00:25:55,590 --> 00:25:57,070
Welcome to the island.

323
00:25:57,120 --> 00:26:02,380
For your own comfort and safety, we ask that you
stay within the confines of your new living quarters.

324
00:26:02,410 --> 00:26:06,500
Our barracks are surrounded
by a high frequency sonar fence

325
00:26:06,510 --> 00:26:11,870
to protect us from the island's
abundant and diverse wildlife.

326
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:14,360
How are we gonna do this?

327
00:26:14,860 --> 00:26:17,880
Shephard? Jack shephard?

328
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:21,560
Here we go.

329
00:26:22,010 --> 00:26:24,890
Hey, jack. Have a seat.

330
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:29,760
Of course it isn't here.

331
00:26:30,660 --> 00:26:32,620
- what's that?
- Your file.

332
00:26:32,630 --> 00:26:35,440
Could they be any more
disorganized on the other side?

333
00:26:36,660 --> 00:26:39,750
Sorry. Namaste. I'm pierre chang.

334
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:41,570
Welcome to the dharma initiative.

335
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:43,410
How was your ride in?

336
00:26:43,420 --> 00:26:45,420
- It was fine.
- Good.

337
00:26:45,430 --> 00:26:47,870
Who was your shuttle driver?

338
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:49,480
I'm sorry?

339
00:26:50,050 --> 00:26:52,560
the shuttle from the
sub. Who was your driver?

340
00:26:52,570 --> 00:26:57,110
Oh, that was, uh... mr. Lafleur.

341
00:26:57,120 --> 00:27:00,940
Ah, yes. Good man, lafleur.
Runs a very tight operation.

342
00:27:02,570 --> 00:27:04,650
I'm sorry for the disorganization.

343
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:08,030
The woman who was supposed to be
processing you in had a baby last night.

344
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:10,330
I got pulled out of my lab. I...

345
00:27:10,810 --> 00:27:14,920
ah, here it is... your job assignment.

346
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:21,380
you've been assigned to the shed.

347
00:27:22,070 --> 00:27:23,840
"Work man." What does--
what does that mean?

348
00:27:23,850 --> 00:27:27,520
Based on your aptitude test,
you'll be doing janitorial work.

349
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:39,110
hey there, ma'am. They
haven't called you yet?

350
00:27:39,950 --> 00:27:41,670
No. Not yet.

351
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:43,660
What's your name?

352
00:27:43,670 --> 00:27:45,970
Kate... austen.

353
00:27:45,980 --> 00:27:50,110
Austen. austen...

354
00:27:57,130 --> 00:28:01,120
You're not on my list, and you're
not on the sub manifest either.

355
00:28:01,130 --> 00:28:03,390
Who's your recruiter?

356
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:09,520
hold on, phil. I just
got the new list from amy.

357
00:28:09,530 --> 00:28:14,970
Some, uh, last-minute additions,
includinG... miss austen?

358
00:28:20,620 --> 00:28:23,770
All righty then. She's all yours.

359
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:30,080
I'm sorry for the mix-up. I'm juliet.

360
00:28:32,110 --> 00:28:33,940
Kate.

361
00:28:33,970 --> 00:28:36,840
Hi, kate. Welcome to the island.

362
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:54,530
what the hell happened?

363
00:28:54,570 --> 00:28:57,280
Sayid just came walking out of
the jungle in handcuffs alone.

364
00:28:57,290 --> 00:28:59,870
What? Did he say anything
about the plane they were on?

365
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:03,700
No, I couldn't talk to him. Radzinsky thinks
he's a hostile. He won't leave us alone.

366
00:29:05,710 --> 00:29:07,900
I got this.

367
00:29:11,070 --> 00:29:13,020
- Where is he?
- Locked in the storage room.

368
00:29:13,030 --> 00:29:13,810
Give me the key.

369
00:29:13,830 --> 00:29:15,840
You need to
know, lafleur--

370
00:29:15,890 --> 00:29:20,340
he saw the model of the swan, and he could've
seen the survey of where we're building it.

371
00:29:20,370 --> 00:29:22,310
- Your point is?
- He's a spy.

372
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:26,610
This whole thing is an act, and
we either play into it or we don'T.

373
00:29:27,890 --> 00:29:30,530
We can end this right now.

374
00:29:30,540 --> 00:29:33,600
What theell are you
talking about, radzinsky?

375
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:37,180
We shoot him.

376
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:42,820
Well, I appreciate your
input there, quick draw.

377
00:29:42,860 --> 00:29:45,880
But I wanna talk to him
first. Give me the damn keys.

378
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:08,310
my name's lafleur. I'm head of security.

379
00:30:09,330 --> 00:30:12,510
I want you to listen real
carefully to what I got to say.

380
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:17,370
And if you do that,
you'll be fine. Understand?

381
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:22,890
All right, let's start simple.

382
00:30:22,930 --> 00:30:25,540
Identify yourself as a hostile.

383
00:30:27,780 --> 00:30:32,240
The terms of the truce say you
gotta identify yourself as a hostile,

384
00:30:32,250 --> 00:30:35,030
or we got the right to shoot you.

385
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:41,320
We do not refer to ourselves as
"hostile," but yes, I-I am one of them.

386
00:30:45,220 --> 00:30:48,730
all right. Good. Now we can
proceed like a couple of gtlemen.

387
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:51,880
All right, let's go. Just
taking him back to the barracks.

388
00:30:51,890 --> 00:30:53,960
Oh, if you're taking him
in, then I'm coming with you.

389
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,420
this is a horrible mistake.

390
00:30:56,430 --> 00:30:58,290
I'm gonna talk directly
to horace about this.

391
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:00,530
Fine. Talk away.

392
00:31:13,020 --> 00:31:15,940
You wanna remind me why
the hell we're doing this?

393
00:31:16,210 --> 00:31:20,700
Ben said if my husband is on the isla, the
best place to start looking for him is here.

394
00:31:20,730 --> 00:31:24,930
Oh, I see, that's some advice you took
before you whacked him in the head.

395
00:31:52,710 --> 00:31:54,710
tell me you saw that.

396
00:31:56,470 --> 00:31:58,680
Probably just an animal.

397
00:31:59,750 --> 00:32:01,930
Animal. Right.

398
00:32:20,510 --> 00:32:22,800
I'm sorry to say, sun, but...

399
00:32:23,830 --> 00:32:26,460
I don't think we're gonna
find your husband here.

400
00:32:26,470 --> 00:32:29,070
Maybe we oughta just head back.

401
00:32:59,490 --> 00:33:01,290
hello.

402
00:33:01,330 --> 00:33:03,460
Who the hell are you?

403
00:33:03,790 --> 00:33:06,070
My name's christian.

404
00:33:08,090 --> 00:33:09,910
I'm looking for my husband.

405
00:33:09,940 --> 00:33:13,670
His name is jin kwon.
Do you know where he is?

406
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:19,200
Follow me.

407
00:33:36,420 --> 00:33:37,590
What is this place?

408
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:41,860
'72... '76, '78...

409
00:33:41,870 --> 00:33:43,390
where is my husband?

410
00:33:43,430 --> 00:33:45,970
Here we go. '77.

411
00:33:46,780 --> 00:33:51,940
He's, uh... he's with your friends.

412
00:33:51,950 --> 00:33:54,490
What are you talking
about? What friends?

413
00:34:08,770 --> 00:34:11,950
I'm sorry, but you have a
bit of a journey ahead of you.

414
00:34:17,890 --> 00:34:22,460
okay, ready? Everybody say, "namaste!"

415
00:34:22,470 --> 00:34:24,110
namastE.

416
00:34:24,130 --> 00:34:26,530
- Nama-what?
- okay.

417
00:34:26,540 --> 00:34:27,610
right on.

418
00:34:27,640 --> 00:34:29,810
So you guys have the rest
of the day to get acquainted

419
00:34:29,830 --> 00:34:32,620
with your security protocol
handbooks waitin' in your new digs.

420
00:34:32,650 --> 00:34:36,850
Now some of it may seem a little scary, but I
promise you all, we are perfectly safe here, okay?

421
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:40,320
So make yourselves at home. Come
on. We got hamburgers. We got punch.

422
00:34:41,220 --> 00:34:43,790
you there, phil? We're
coming in with a fourteen-J.

423
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:45,940
Roger that, mr. Lafleur.

424
00:35:00,290 --> 00:35:04,430
okay, if I could get everyone to hold back,
please, we have a minor security situation.

425
00:35:10,580 --> 00:35:12,450
move.

426
00:35:24,050 --> 00:35:26,130
I guess we found sayid.

427
00:35:44,460 --> 00:35:47,300
All right, you can hang out here until
we can figure out what to do with you.

428
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:49,490
What are we gonna do with him?

429
00:35:51,870 --> 00:35:55,110
bring the man some damn
food. We're not savages.

430
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:13,950
ah, excuse me.

431
00:36:14,390 --> 00:36:17,230
could you tell me where
james lafleur lives?

432
00:36:17,490 --> 00:36:19,640
Uh, that's his house right there.

433
00:36:20,210 --> 00:36:22,160
thanks.

434
00:36:23,780 --> 00:36:26,200
But I wouldn't call him "james."

435
00:36:27,460 --> 00:36:29,780
He hates it.

436
00:36:57,320 --> 00:36:59,160
hey, jack.

437
00:37:01,700 --> 00:37:04,620
I saw you earlier today
when you were helping kate,

438
00:37:04,630 --> 00:37:07,080
and I wanted to say
something to you then, but...

439
00:37:07,740 --> 00:37:10,160
we're not supposed to know each other.

440
00:37:10,170 --> 00:37:12,950
Yeah.

441
00:37:16,310 --> 00:37:18,620
I was looking for sawyer. I
guess I came to the wrong house.

442
00:37:18,630 --> 00:37:21,370
No. Come in.

443
00:37:27,490 --> 00:37:29,580
Evening, doc.

444
00:37:36,890 --> 00:37:39,750
well, I'm sure you two
have a lot to talk about.

445
00:37:45,060 --> 00:37:47,040
Take a load off. You want a beer?

446
00:37:47,050 --> 00:37:50,380
No. no, I'm fine.

447
00:37:54,330 --> 00:37:56,750
What can I do for you, jack?

448
00:37:59,980 --> 00:38:02,240
I don't even know where to start.

449
00:38:03,950 --> 00:38:06,320
how about with sayid?

450
00:38:07,060 --> 00:38:08,760
I had no choice.

451
00:38:08,790 --> 00:38:11,850
He was running around in the
jungle, got caught by my people.

452
00:38:11,860 --> 00:38:16,950
And seein' as how he can't tell the truth
about how he got here, I had to improvise.

453
00:38:17,410 --> 00:38:18,970
Improvise?

454
00:38:19,990 --> 00:38:24,100
And for now, sayid is safe,
which is all that matters.

455
00:38:27,170 --> 00:38:29,560
So where do we go from here?

456
00:38:29,570 --> 00:38:30,560
I'm working on it.

457
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:33,580
Really? Because it looked to
me like you were reading a book.

458
00:38:37,870 --> 00:38:42,410
I heard once winston churchill read a
book every night, even during the blitz.

459
00:38:42,740 --> 00:38:45,400
He said it made him think better.

460
00:38:46,330 --> 00:38:49,620
It's how I like to run things. I think.

461
00:38:50,780 --> 00:38:54,430
I'm sure that doesn't mean that much to you,
'cause back when you were calling the shots,

462
00:38:54,470 --> 00:38:57,000
you pretty much just reacted.

463
00:38:57,580 --> 00:39:02,900
See, you didn't think, jack, and as I
recall, a lot of people ended up dead.

464
00:39:06,370 --> 00:39:09,150
I gous off the island.

465
00:39:09,690 --> 00:39:13,150
But here you are... right
back where you started.

466
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:18,210
So I'm gonna go back to reading
my book, and I'm gonna think,

467
00:39:19,870 --> 00:39:22,790
'cause that's how I
saved your ass today.

468
00:39:22,820 --> 00:39:25,750
And that's how I'm gonna
save sayid's tomorrow.

469
00:39:27,580 --> 00:39:30,340
All you gotta do is go home,
get a good night's rest.

470
00:39:30,370 --> 00:39:32,780
Let me do what I do.

471
00:39:35,630 --> 00:39:38,140
now ain't that a relief?

472
00:39:39,980 --> 00:39:41,860
Yeah.

473
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:29,710
Hey, phil. I'm just gonna go in
there and deliver him a sandwich.

474
00:40:31,260 --> 00:40:33,110
All right.

475
00:40:42,550 --> 00:40:44,660
hello.

476
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:52,630
I brought you a sandwich.

477
00:40:59,700 --> 00:41:04,710
I didn't put mustard on it, but if
you'd like some, I could get some.

478
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:10,510
This will be fine. Thank you.

479
00:41:12,420 --> 00:41:14,730
are you a hostile?

480
00:41:16,490 --> 00:41:18,780
Do you think I am?

481
00:41:22,110 --> 00:41:24,130
What's your name?

482
00:41:24,850 --> 00:41:27,140
Sayid.

483
00:41:27,490 --> 00:41:29,740
What's yours?

484
00:41:30,300 --> 00:41:32,370
I'm ben.

485
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:41,170
It's nice to meet you, ben.
