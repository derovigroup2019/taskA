1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:01,692
<i>Previously on "Lost":</i>

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:03,743
Woah, woah.
Woah, woah.

3
00:00:04,044 --> 00:00:04,981
Desmond.

4
00:00:05,471 --> 00:00:06,539
<i>I need you to go</i>

5
00:00:06,575 --> 00:00:09,068
back to
Oxford University.

6
00:00:09,099 --> 00:00:10,150
<i>Go back to where
we met...</i>

7
00:00:10,184 --> 00:00:11,911
I need you to go there
and find my mother.

8
00:00:11,912 --> 00:00:12,754
Her name is--

9
00:00:14,684 --> 00:00:17,233
So what happens if I can't
get them all to come back?

10
00:00:17,553 --> 00:00:18,890
Then God help us all.

11
00:00:19,307 --> 00:00:20,856
I'm going back
to the island today...

12
00:00:20,890 --> 00:00:22,634
<i>Just as soon
as I do one thing--</i>

13
00:00:23,192 --> 00:00:25,375
- Kill your daughter.
- What are you doing here?

14
00:00:27,296 --> 00:00:28,027
Desmond?!

15
00:00:34,385 --> 00:00:35,332
He's coding!

16
00:00:37,540 --> 00:00:38,751
Gunshot wound.
He's crashing.

17
00:00:38,886 --> 00:00:39,572
Bay 7. Now!

18
00:00:39,609 --> 00:00:40,855
- Is he gonna be okay?
- You're gonna have to wait here, ma'am.

19
00:00:40,896 --> 00:00:41,653
Where are you--
Where are you taking him?

20
00:00:41,683 --> 00:00:42,115
What's happening?

21
00:00:42,141 --> 00:00:43,526
Please, ma'am,
wait here.

22
00:00:43,616 --> 00:00:45,104
We'll let you know as
soon as we know anything.

23
00:00:45,461 --> 00:00:47,298
Well, what's happening?
Is he gonna be okay?

24
00:00:47,385 --> 00:00:48,837
We're going to do
everything we can.

25
00:00:48,921 --> 00:00:49,924
Please just wait.

26
00:00:49,965 --> 00:00:51,594
<i>Daddy!</i>

27
00:00:51,634 --> 00:00:54,493
He's gonna be okay.
He's gonna be okay.

28
00:01:05,504 --> 00:01:07,017
How old is your son?

29
00:01:07,837 --> 00:01:08,997
He's two.

30
00:01:12,923 --> 00:01:14,828
He has
his father's hair.

31
00:01:18,547 --> 00:01:20,222
I'm sorry.
Do I know you?

32
00:01:20,549 --> 00:01:23,050
Uh, no,
but your husband does.

33
00:01:23,552 --> 00:01:25,186
I'm Eloise Hawking,

34
00:01:25,221 --> 00:01:27,929
and I believe
it's my son's fault

35
00:01:27,964 --> 00:01:30,693
that
Desmond has been shot.

36
00:01:31,984 --> 00:01:33,842
Your son is
Benjamin Linus?

37
00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:35,518
Good Lord, no.

38
00:01:38,968 --> 00:01:42,001
My son is
Daniel Faraday.

39
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:53,491
<i>Hey, can I get a hand
with this?</i>

40
00:01:53,518 --> 00:01:54,392
<i>Yeah, yeah.</i>

41
00:02:02,124 --> 00:02:02,844
Dan.

42
00:02:03,723 --> 00:02:04,728
Hey, Miles.

43
00:02:06,093 --> 00:02:07,305
Long time no see.

44
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:08,544
<i>All right,
ladies and gentlemen,</i>

45
00:02:08,590 --> 00:02:11,078
<i>you know why you're here.
I wish you could all get</i>

46
00:02:11,118 --> 00:02:12,233
<i>a good night's sleep,
but, uh...</i>

47
00:02:12,283 --> 00:02:12,729
What the hell
are you

48
00:02:12,752 --> 00:02:13,739
doing back here,
Dan?

49
00:02:14,270 --> 00:02:16,848
Once you left for Ann Arbor,
I figured you'd gotten rich,

50
00:02:16,874 --> 00:02:18,122
invented the DVD
or something.

51
00:02:18,148 --> 00:02:18,814
<i>The shuttle
will pick you up</i>

52
00:02:18,815 --> 00:02:19,225
<i>at the motor pool...</i>

53
00:02:19,245 --> 00:02:20,075
<i>This</i> is what

54
00:02:20,096 --> 00:02:20,898
<i>I'm doing back here.</i>

55
00:02:20,899 --> 00:02:21,277
<i>Let's go...</i>

56
00:02:21,863 --> 00:02:23,173
When did they get here?

57
00:02:23,193 --> 00:02:25,242
A few days ago.
It's weird, huh?

58
00:02:25,562 --> 00:02:27,133
- LaFleur managed to--
- We don't have time.

59
00:02:27,168 --> 00:02:27,682
I need you

60
00:02:27,717 --> 00:02:29,208
to take me to Jack's
right now, okay?

61
00:02:39,795 --> 00:02:42,063
- Jack. How did you get back here?
- Faraday? What the--

62
00:02:42,198 --> 00:02:43,166
- How did you do it?
- Whoa.

63
00:02:43,566 --> 00:02:44,943
How did you
get back to the island?

64
00:02:45,337 --> 00:02:46,197
Where have you been?

65
00:02:46,251 --> 00:02:48,392
I was--I was just at
Dharma Headquarters in Ann Arbor.

66
00:02:48,433 --> 00:02:49,457
I was doing
some research.

67
00:02:49,527 --> 00:02:50,882
What's more important
right now...

68
00:02:51,115 --> 00:02:53,882
How did you get back here
to 1977?

69
00:02:53,897 --> 00:02:55,644
What's going on?

70
00:02:55,722 --> 00:02:57,540
Don't look at me.
I just carried his luggage.

71
00:02:57,625 --> 00:02:58,700
Jack, how?

72
00:02:58,745 --> 00:03:03,011
Uh... we were on a plane,
and then there was--

73
00:03:03,052 --> 00:03:04,298
Who told you
to get on a plane?

74
00:03:05,287 --> 00:03:07,395
As a matter of fact, Dan,
it was your mother.

75
00:03:10,326 --> 00:03:12,500
<i>And how did she
convince you, Jack?</i>

76
00:03:12,828 --> 00:03:15,304
Did she tell you
it was your destiny?

77
00:03:17,223 --> 00:03:18,962
Yeah.
That's exactly what she said.

78
00:03:19,702 --> 00:03:21,874
Well, I got some bad news
for you, Jack.

79
00:03:22,405 --> 00:03:24,146
You don't belong here
at all.

80
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:26,855
She was wrong.

81
00:03:33,464 --> 00:03:35,396
S05E14:
The Variable

82
00:04:04,888 --> 00:04:07,795
What's wrong, Mom?
Didn't you like it?

83
00:04:08,525 --> 00:04:09,513
I loved it.

84
00:04:12,128 --> 00:04:13,810
It was beautiful,
Daniel.

85
00:04:22,438 --> 00:04:23,225
Daniel...

86
00:04:25,171 --> 00:04:27,114
Do you know
what destiny means?

87
00:04:29,187 --> 00:04:29,905
No.

88
00:04:30,046 --> 00:04:31,206
<i>Destiny means that,</i>

89
00:04:31,850 --> 00:04:33,917
if one has
a special gift,

90
00:04:35,652 --> 00:04:37,482
then it
must be nurtured.

91
00:04:39,966 --> 00:04:41,819
How many beats
has that metronome counted

92
00:04:41,859 --> 00:04:43,038
since you started
playing?

93
00:04:43,761 --> 00:04:45,581
864.

94
00:04:51,301 --> 00:04:53,581
Your gift, Daniel,
is your mind--

95
00:04:53,770 --> 00:04:57,292
<i>a mind that is meant
for science, mathematics.</i>

96
00:04:57,685 --> 00:05:00,555
And it's my... job

97
00:05:02,345 --> 00:05:03,745
to keep you
on your path.

98
00:05:05,849 --> 00:05:07,946
So...
unfortunately,

99
00:05:09,352 --> 00:05:12,692
there's no more time...
for distractions.

100
00:05:12,823 --> 00:05:15,277
But I <i>want</i> to
keep playing the piano.

101
00:05:15,492 --> 00:05:17,191
I can do both.

102
00:05:17,861 --> 00:05:19,856
I can <i>make</i> time.

103
00:05:22,698 --> 00:05:24,079
If only you could.

104
00:05:33,443 --> 00:05:34,998
Miles, I need you to bring me
to the Orchid.

105
00:05:35,186 --> 00:05:36,825
Can you drive me right now?
Please?

106
00:05:36,865 --> 00:05:38,302
- Yeah, yeah, sure. I guess.
- Thanks.

107
00:05:39,716 --> 00:05:40,424
Come on.

108
00:05:41,236 --> 00:05:41,804
Faraday!

109
00:05:41,824 --> 00:05:42,462
Miles, come.

110
00:05:42,492 --> 00:05:42,929
Wait up!

111
00:05:42,955 --> 00:05:43,725
Jack,
we'll be right back.

112
00:05:43,755 --> 00:05:45,104
What did you mean,
you mother was wrong?

113
00:05:45,804 --> 00:05:46,391
<i>Daniel!</i>

114
00:05:46,424 --> 00:05:48,044
I just--
I just have an errand to run.

115
00:05:48,697 --> 00:05:49,538
<i>Be right back!</i>

116
00:05:58,201 --> 00:05:59,881
- Yeah?
- Faraday's back.

117
00:06:00,836 --> 00:06:02,435
What do you mean
Faraday's back?

118
00:06:02,470 --> 00:06:03,098
Why?

119
00:06:03,133 --> 00:06:04,052
<i>I have no idea.</i>

120
00:06:04,303 --> 00:06:05,966
He came in on the sub,
and he woke me up.

121
00:06:05,998 --> 00:06:08,010
He--he started talking
nonsense,

122
00:06:08,044 --> 00:06:09,664
and then he took off
to the Orchid.

123
00:06:10,046 --> 00:06:11,370
I'd love to trade theories
about this,

124
00:06:11,421 --> 00:06:12,714
but I'm a little busy
right now.

125
00:06:13,384 --> 00:06:15,356
What are you busy with
at 6:00 in the morning?

126
00:06:15,437 --> 00:06:16,731
James, tell him.

127
00:06:17,831 --> 00:06:19,767
Get in here.

128
00:06:26,829 --> 00:06:29,589
Phil...
One of my security guys...

129
00:06:30,133 --> 00:06:32,106
got himself a videotape
of me and Kate

130
00:06:32,132 --> 00:06:33,744
taking the kid
out to the hostiles.

131
00:06:34,838 --> 00:06:35,595
And where's the tape?

132
00:06:36,405 --> 00:06:37,116
With Phil.

133
00:06:37,474 --> 00:06:38,670
And where is Phil?

134
00:06:42,345 --> 00:06:44,972
Phil, Jack.
Jack... Phil.

135
00:06:55,658 --> 00:06:56,740
<i>Are we...</i>

136
00:06:57,260 --> 00:06:58,384
waiting for something?

137
00:07:03,862 --> 00:07:04,983
Right on time.

138
00:07:12,208 --> 00:07:13,690
I'll be back
in ten minutes.

139
00:07:32,898 --> 00:07:34,216
So what <i>do</i> you
want me to do?

140
00:07:34,450 --> 00:07:35,493
<i>You're gonna do nothing.</i>

141
00:07:35,733 --> 00:07:38,064
<i>If you drill
even 1 centimeter further,</i>

142
00:07:38,234 --> 00:07:39,698
you risk
releasing that energy.

143
00:07:39,769 --> 00:07:40,756
If that were to happen...

144
00:07:42,371 --> 00:07:43,708
then God help us all.

145
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:46,445
Hey!
You need a hard hat down here.

146
00:07:56,252 --> 00:07:57,321
Watch yourself!

147
00:07:57,495 --> 00:07:58,794
Sorry, sir.
Won't happen again.

148
00:08:02,892 --> 00:08:03,499
Come on.

149
00:08:04,394 --> 00:08:05,465
I'll grab
the rest of his stuff.

150
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:06,123
<i>Let's go.</i>

151
00:08:12,694 --> 00:08:13,698
Did you <i>hear</i> that?

152
00:08:14,237 --> 00:08:17,523
Time travel. How stupid
does that guy think we are?

153
00:08:22,439 --> 00:08:23,337
Dr. Chang?

154
00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:24,682
Dr. Chang?

155
00:08:24,748 --> 00:08:25,681
Do you have
a second, sir?

156
00:08:28,184 --> 00:08:30,449
I just came in on the sub
with the Swan team.

157
00:08:30,663 --> 00:08:32,765
We actually met three years ago,
I'm Daniel Faraday.

158
00:08:32,817 --> 00:08:34,738
Yes. Yes.
Uh, you arrived with LaFleur.

159
00:08:34,773 --> 00:08:35,686
- I remember.
- Right.

160
00:08:35,712 --> 00:08:36,573
What can I do for you?

161
00:08:36,825 --> 00:08:39,334
I need you to order
the evacuation

162
00:08:39,585 --> 00:08:41,754
of every man, woman and child
on this island.

163
00:08:42,732 --> 00:08:43,990
And why would I do that?

164
00:08:43,992 --> 00:08:46,441
Because that man
is on a stretcher

165
00:08:46,486 --> 00:08:49,120
as a consequence
of the electromagnetic activity

166
00:08:49,145 --> 00:08:51,400
that your drilling
unleashed down here.

167
00:08:53,376 --> 00:08:54,764
Which is now contained.

168
00:08:58,648 --> 00:09:00,781
It's contained down here.

169
00:09:01,016 --> 00:09:02,745
But in about six hours,

170
00:09:02,819 --> 00:09:04,732
the same thing
is gonna happen

171
00:09:04,755 --> 00:09:06,360
at the site
for the Swan Station,

172
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:07,635
only the energy there...

173
00:09:07,670 --> 00:09:10,874
is about 30,000 times
more powerful, sir.

174
00:09:10,899 --> 00:09:12,238
And the accident...

175
00:09:13,017 --> 00:09:14,915
It's gonna be
catastrophic.

176
00:09:15,698 --> 00:09:17,539
That is utterly absurd.

177
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:19,063
What could possibly
qualify you

178
00:09:19,108 --> 00:09:20,241
to make
that kind of prediction?

179
00:09:22,438 --> 00:09:23,082
Hmm?

180
00:09:24,306 --> 00:09:26,308
I'm from the future.

181
00:09:33,492 --> 00:09:34,605
Dr. Chang, wait!

182
00:09:34,946 --> 00:09:36,062
Will you wait
one second, please?

183
00:09:36,093 --> 00:09:37,750
- Yes, yes.
- <i>Wait one--one second.</i>

184
00:09:37,785 --> 00:09:38,936
You're
from the future.

185
00:09:39,031 --> 00:09:41,234
<i>You heard me talking
about time travel.</i>

186
00:09:41,301 --> 00:09:42,587
Now you've had your fun.

187
00:09:42,639 --> 00:09:43,369
- Good for you.
- No, no.

188
00:09:43,370 --> 00:09:44,553
<i>Please,</i> Dr. Chang.

189
00:09:44,871 --> 00:09:47,511
Just look at my journal, please.
Look at these equations.

190
00:09:48,073 --> 00:09:50,910
Some of them won't be discovered
for another 20 years.

191
00:09:50,945 --> 00:09:51,876
- <i>Hey! Hey!</i>
- Dr. Chang--

192
00:09:51,911 --> 00:09:54,178
Hey! Hey! Hey, Dan!
Leave the man alone.

193
00:09:54,213 --> 00:09:56,401
Sorry, Dr. Chang. I think he had
too many drugs on the sub--

194
00:09:56,432 --> 00:09:57,141
Dr. Chang...

195
00:09:59,185 --> 00:10:00,502
Miles is your son.

196
00:10:04,464 --> 00:10:06,206
- Excuse me?
- Think about it.

197
00:10:06,241 --> 00:10:11,338
A Chinese man named Miles;
the same name as your baby--

198
00:10:11,373 --> 00:10:13,420
shows up with me
from the future.

199
00:10:13,632 --> 00:10:17,504
You--you <i>really</i> think
this is all... coincidence?

200
00:10:21,674 --> 00:10:23,011
Is this true?

201
00:10:23,742 --> 00:10:24,451
No.

202
00:10:27,007 --> 00:10:27,715
Please...

203
00:10:28,447 --> 00:10:29,585
Stay away from me.

204
00:10:30,783 --> 00:10:31,433
Dr. Chang...

205
00:10:31,550 --> 00:10:32,900
Dr. Chang!

206
00:10:32,946 --> 00:10:33,929
- Hey. Hey.
- If you--

207
00:10:33,944 --> 00:10:35,111
Are you
out of your mind?

208
00:10:35,421 --> 00:10:37,032
- What are you doing?
- I'm just making sure

209
00:10:37,063 --> 00:10:38,995
that your father does
what he's supposed to do.

210
00:10:39,518 --> 00:10:40,399
And what's that?

211
00:10:43,629 --> 00:10:44,527
You'll see.

212
00:10:55,728 --> 00:10:56,370
Hi, Mom.

213
00:10:57,242 --> 00:10:58,600
<i>I want you
to meet Theresa.</i>

214
00:10:59,733 --> 00:11:00,747
Dan's told me
so much about--

215
00:11:00,782 --> 00:11:01,603
Pleased to meet you.

216
00:11:02,081 --> 00:11:03,769
Well done, Daniel.

217
00:11:04,390 --> 00:11:04,923
Ah...

218
00:11:04,964 --> 00:11:06,116
You much be
so proud of him.

219
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:09,987
Daniel, I thought we could
celebrate your accomplishment

220
00:11:10,013 --> 00:11:10,952
with lunch.

221
00:11:11,088 --> 00:11:12,523
There's a
nice restaurant nearby.

222
00:11:12,524 --> 00:11:14,172
I reserved us a table.

223
00:11:15,062 --> 00:11:16,461
We would love to.

224
00:11:17,169 --> 00:11:21,328
Actually, I was hoping
it would be just the two of us.

225
00:11:22,067 --> 00:11:23,639
You do understand,
don't you?

226
00:11:23,674 --> 00:11:26,775
It's just that I don't get
to see my son very often.

227
00:11:27,072 --> 00:11:28,546
- Mother...
- I understand.

228
00:11:28,975 --> 00:11:30,261
It's okay, Dan.
Really.

229
00:11:35,781 --> 00:11:37,878
Is there something
bothering you, Daniel?

230
00:11:40,152 --> 00:11:41,790
You were so rude
to Theresa.

231
00:11:42,221 --> 00:11:43,680
Was I?

232
00:11:44,290 --> 00:11:48,211
- Theresa is my girlfriend.
- She is your research assistant.

233
00:11:50,062 --> 00:11:52,561
We should be focusing
your energies on your work.

234
00:11:52,696 --> 00:11:53,625
On my work.

235
00:11:53,658 --> 00:11:55,534
Yes.
<i>That</i> is what is important.

236
00:11:55,569 --> 00:11:58,143
Yes. You've made it
abundantly clear.

237
00:11:58,370 --> 00:12:00,185
Why would I waste
my gift on a woman--

238
00:12:00,236 --> 00:12:01,815
I'm sorry to tell you,
Daniel,

239
00:12:01,975 --> 00:12:04,487
but you're not going to
have time for relationships.

240
00:12:04,710 --> 00:12:07,962
The women in your life
will only be terribly hurt.

241
00:12:10,016 --> 00:12:11,193
What does that mean?

242
00:12:12,084 --> 00:12:14,230
It means that your work
will always comes first,

243
00:12:14,265 --> 00:12:14,914
that's all.

244
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:16,891
Only because that's what
you always push me to do.

245
00:12:16,952 --> 00:12:19,490
You pushed and you pushed
and you <i>pushed.</i>

246
00:12:19,525 --> 00:12:22,224
And when will it be enough,
Mother? When?

247
00:12:22,259 --> 00:12:23,360
I'm the
youngest doctorate ever

248
00:12:23,361 --> 00:12:24,462
to ever graduate
from Oxford.

249
00:12:24,496 --> 00:12:25,288
I just got a new

250
00:12:25,314 --> 00:12:27,723
1.5 million pound
research grant.

251
00:12:28,855 --> 00:12:31,837
- What else do I have to do?
- A grant?

252
00:12:32,118 --> 00:12:34,450
That's wonderful!
From whom?

253
00:12:35,727 --> 00:12:36,971
I don't know.
Um...

254
00:12:37,928 --> 00:12:39,347
Some industrialist.

255
00:12:40,815 --> 00:12:41,863
Widmore, I think.

256
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:47,428
Charles Widmore.

257
00:12:53,377 --> 00:12:55,436
I don't want to
fight with you, Daniel.

258
00:12:55,594 --> 00:12:57,435
That's not why
I came.

259
00:12:57,463 --> 00:12:58,779
<i>Why</i> did you come?

260
00:13:06,572 --> 00:13:08,365
To congratulate you.

261
00:13:18,851 --> 00:13:20,082
Good luck, Daniel.

262
00:13:21,453 --> 00:13:24,372
And I do hope you know
that I mean that.

263
00:14:04,029 --> 00:14:05,327
All right, people.

264
00:14:05,898 --> 00:14:06,790
Party's over.

265
00:14:10,169 --> 00:14:11,596
I know y'all
just showed up.

266
00:14:12,538 --> 00:14:14,706
The rest of us have been here
for the past three years.

267
00:14:16,075 --> 00:14:17,099
This is our home.

268
00:14:17,844 --> 00:14:19,358
The last thing I wanna do
is leave.

269
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:22,548
But we ain't
got no choice.

270
00:14:23,163 --> 00:14:25,078
Well, that dude in the closet--
I thought he worked for you.

271
00:14:25,351 --> 00:14:26,915
Can't you convince him
that it was all, like,

272
00:14:26,987 --> 00:14:27,954
a misunderstanding?

273
00:14:28,006 --> 00:14:29,905
I punched the man
in the damn face, Hugo.

274
00:14:29,932 --> 00:14:31,763
What am I supposed to say--
"My fist slipped"?

275
00:14:32,292 --> 00:14:33,431
How much time
do we have

276
00:14:33,446 --> 00:14:35,293
before someone realizes
he's gone?

277
00:14:35,982 --> 00:14:36,710
Not enough.

278
00:14:37,363 --> 00:14:38,320
So where do we go?

279
00:14:41,668 --> 00:14:43,062
We only got
two options.

280
00:14:43,268 --> 00:14:44,644
We can either
commandeer the sub,

281
00:14:44,690 --> 00:14:47,109
get the hell off this island
before anyone knows we're gone...

282
00:14:48,551 --> 00:14:50,125
Or we can head back
in the jungle,

283
00:14:50,131 --> 00:14:51,212
start from square one.

284
00:14:52,778 --> 00:14:54,013
I'm not getting
on that sub

285
00:14:54,043 --> 00:14:56,195
if there's a chance that my wife
is still on this island.

286
00:14:56,954 --> 00:14:57,854
<i>Yeah, me neither.</i>

287
00:14:58,083 --> 00:14:59,629
After all we did
to get back here?

288
00:14:59,669 --> 00:15:01,208
And now we're just gonna
run off again?

289
00:15:02,154 --> 00:15:03,657
It'd be kinda
wishy-washy.

290
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:05,903
Right.
That's two votes for square one.

291
00:15:06,549 --> 00:15:08,292
Anybody else wanna--

292
00:15:13,217 --> 00:15:14,889
Hold your horses!
Be right there.

293
00:15:26,083 --> 00:15:26,813
Hey, James.

294
00:15:28,485 --> 00:15:30,062
Welcome to the meeting,
Twitchy.

295
00:15:31,316 --> 00:15:32,515
Good to
see you again.

296
00:15:32,570 --> 00:15:34,841
Pound cake's in the kitchen.
Help yourself to the punch.

297
00:15:35,688 --> 00:15:36,802
Is he still crazy?

298
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:38,258
It's on a
whole new level, man.

299
00:15:38,946 --> 00:15:39,742
Great.

300
00:15:41,984 --> 00:15:45,058
Jack...
I'm sorry I was rude before,

301
00:15:45,917 --> 00:15:46,831
but what I came to do

302
00:15:46,865 --> 00:15:49,555
is of critical importance
to everyone in this room.

303
00:15:50,736 --> 00:15:53,720
Does anyone know
where I can find the hostiles?

304
00:15:58,110 --> 00:15:59,678
Why do you need
to know that, Daniel?

305
00:16:03,215 --> 00:16:04,940
Because one of them
is my mother.

306
00:16:09,438 --> 00:16:11,992
And she is the only person
on this island

307
00:16:12,258 --> 00:16:14,036
who can get us back
to where we belong.

308
00:16:24,677 --> 00:16:26,309
<i>This haunting footage
comes to us from</i>

309
00:16:26,366 --> 00:16:28,373
<i>the "Christiane I," a salvage
vehicle in the Indian Ocean.</i>

310
00:16:28,373 --> 00:16:29,700
- <i>in the Indian Ocean.
- How do you want your eggs, Dan?</i>

311
00:16:29,862 --> 00:16:30,866
<i>For more than two months,</i>

312
00:16:30,896 --> 00:16:32,075
<i>it's been
scouring the depths of</i>

313
00:16:32,075 --> 00:16:33,197
- <i>Sunda trench off Bali...</i>
- So what happened?

314
00:16:33,228 --> 00:16:34,106
They found that missing plane?

315
00:16:34,130 --> 00:16:36,640
<i>In search of the long-missing
Oceanic Flight 815.</i>

316
00:16:37,524 --> 00:16:38,399
- Dan?
- <i>Late last night,</i>

317
00:16:38,466 --> 00:16:40,692
<i>the "Christiane" deployed
two remotely operated vehicles,</i>

318
00:16:40,738 --> 00:16:42,181
- <i>or R.O.V.S...</i>
- Dan. Why are you so upset?

319
00:16:42,247 --> 00:16:43,287
<i>That verified that</i>

320
00:16:43,312 --> 00:16:45,468
<i>the National Transportation
Safety Board had long feared...</i>

321
00:16:45,488 --> 00:16:47,453
- I don't know.
<i>- That the commercial aircraft...</i>

322
00:16:55,790 --> 00:16:57,082
<i>You have a visitor, Dan.</i>

323
00:16:57,910 --> 00:16:59,523
<i>Would you like some tea?</i>

324
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:00,697
<i>That would be lovely.</i>

325
00:17:02,515 --> 00:17:03,395
<i>Hello, Daniel.</i>

326
00:17:10,171 --> 00:17:12,270
I'm sorry, sir.
I don't...

327
00:17:13,092 --> 00:17:16,235
D-Did Caline tell you
I have a condition

328
00:17:16,271 --> 00:17:18,398
that affects my memory?
Just...

329
00:17:18,652 --> 00:17:20,690
Don't be embarrassed.
We've never met.

330
00:17:21,233 --> 00:17:22,732
My name is
Charles Widmore.

331
00:17:23,636 --> 00:17:24,988
Charles...

332
00:17:27,406 --> 00:17:29,063
Charles Widmore from...

333
00:17:29,909 --> 00:17:31,237
My research grant?

334
00:17:32,119 --> 00:17:34,597
It's very nice to meet you, sir.
Please.

335
00:17:34,922 --> 00:17:35,874
Please sit down.

336
00:17:37,928 --> 00:17:39,647
Mm, a bit of a mess.

337
00:17:40,174 --> 00:17:42,253
I meant to
thank you

338
00:17:42,288 --> 00:17:43,279
before I...

339
00:17:44,323 --> 00:17:45,863
Before I left Oxford.

340
00:17:45,958 --> 00:17:47,740
You mean,
before you were dismissed.

341
00:17:52,298 --> 00:17:53,457
I tested it...

342
00:17:53,829 --> 00:17:56,125
I tested it out
on myself first.

343
00:17:56,171 --> 00:17:58,711
- It's all right, Daniel.
- I would <i>never</i> hurt Theresa.

344
00:17:58,741 --> 00:17:59,712
Please.
It's all right.

345
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:02,043
<i>That's not why
I'm here.</i>

346
00:18:02,703 --> 00:18:05,775
I came to offer you
a new opportunity.

347
00:18:11,383 --> 00:18:13,140
N-no, I...

348
00:18:13,682 --> 00:18:16,422
I'm sorry. I-I can't.
I don't think I-I can...

349
00:18:22,768 --> 00:18:24,653
Did I say something
to upset you?

350
00:18:24,964 --> 00:18:27,624
It's this plane crash.

351
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:30,969
I don't know why
it's bothering me so much.

352
00:18:31,804 --> 00:18:33,279
It's just so sad.

353
00:18:35,174 --> 00:18:36,207
They're dead.

354
00:18:39,863 --> 00:18:42,446
Daniel,
what if I told you...

355
00:18:43,515 --> 00:18:44,649
they're not dead?

356
00:18:47,386 --> 00:18:48,729
What if I told you...

357
00:18:49,421 --> 00:18:51,011
the plane was a fake?

358
00:18:51,260 --> 00:18:52,124
An elaborate...

359
00:18:52,608 --> 00:18:54,539
Expensive fake.

360
00:18:57,696 --> 00:18:59,141
How would you
know that?

361
00:19:01,044 --> 00:19:02,682
Because I put it there.

362
00:19:09,475 --> 00:19:10,530
Well...

363
00:19:11,377 --> 00:19:13,133
Why would you
tell me at?

364
00:19:15,281 --> 00:19:17,850
Because come tomorrow,
you won't remember I did.

365
00:19:21,053 --> 00:19:22,035
Daniel...

366
00:19:23,122 --> 00:19:26,224
The real Oceanic Flight 815
crashed on an island--

367
00:19:26,258 --> 00:19:27,802
A special island...

368
00:19:28,690 --> 00:19:30,602
with unique
scientific properties.

369
00:19:33,218 --> 00:19:35,848
I want to send <i>you</i>
to the island.

370
00:19:37,489 --> 00:19:39,268
It will further
your research,

371
00:19:40,272 --> 00:19:41,334
show you things...

372
00:19:42,341 --> 00:19:43,522
you'd never dream of.

373
00:19:45,057 --> 00:19:46,305
But more importantly...

374
00:19:47,913 --> 00:19:49,358
It will heal you, Daniel--

375
00:19:50,671 --> 00:19:51,705
Your mind...

376
00:19:52,818 --> 00:19:53,850
Your memory.

377
00:19:55,821 --> 00:19:57,043
H-heal me?

378
00:20:02,461 --> 00:20:05,501
W-why are you doing
all this for me?

379
00:20:07,232 --> 00:20:09,240
Because you're a man
of tremendous gifts,

380
00:20:09,260 --> 00:20:11,423
and it would be a shame
to see them go to waste.

381
00:20:16,275 --> 00:20:18,184
You sound
like my mother.

382
00:20:21,614 --> 00:20:23,439
That's because
we're old friends.

383
00:20:32,324 --> 00:20:34,810
Your mother
is an Other?

384
00:20:34,894 --> 00:20:36,213
You met her,
actually,

385
00:20:36,295 --> 00:20:38,634
when the island was skipping,
back in 1954.

386
00:20:39,585 --> 00:20:40,485
They were
calling her "Ellie."

387
00:20:40,488 --> 00:20:42,558
You guys
were in 1954?

388
00:20:43,669 --> 00:20:45,609
Like...
Fonzie times?

389
00:20:45,644 --> 00:20:47,679
You still haven't told us
why you need to find her.

390
00:20:47,710 --> 00:20:48,764
I just need to
talk to her.

391
00:20:48,776 --> 00:20:50,032
I thought you said
we were supposed to lay low.

392
00:20:50,072 --> 00:20:50,799
"Whatever happened,
happened"?

393
00:20:50,819 --> 00:20:52,161
Just tell me where they are,
and I'll go--

394
00:20:52,196 --> 00:20:53,877
I'm <i>not</i>
telling you <i>anything,</i>

395
00:20:53,956 --> 00:20:55,059
and you ain't going
anywhere

396
00:20:55,081 --> 00:20:56,135
unless you wanna
share with us

397
00:20:56,170 --> 00:20:57,333
what the hell
it is you're doing.

398
00:20:57,356 --> 00:20:59,901
Sawyer, he said he can get us back
to where we belonged.

399
00:21:00,804 --> 00:21:03,081
Whether we go on the sub
or we head back into the jungle...

400
00:21:04,558 --> 00:21:05,632
We don't belong here.

401
00:21:05,754 --> 00:21:08,069
Well, I belonged here just fine
till you came back, Doc.

402
00:21:14,905 --> 00:21:16,123
You know
where the hostiles are.

403
00:21:18,370 --> 00:21:18,984
What?

404
00:21:19,301 --> 00:21:20,918
You and Sawyer
took Ben out to them.

405
00:21:21,373 --> 00:21:22,579
Can you get us
back out there?

406
00:21:22,627 --> 00:21:24,718
Whoa, hold on a second.
Don't say a word, Kate.

407
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:26,531
She can say
what she wants to say.

408
00:21:26,868 --> 00:21:27,592
Kate...

409
00:21:27,813 --> 00:21:28,738
You made me promise

410
00:21:28,871 --> 00:21:30,299
to never ask
what happened to Aaron,

411
00:21:30,587 --> 00:21:31,741
or why you came
back here.

412
00:21:32,685 --> 00:21:35,156
But I know that reason isn't...
It isn't here.

413
00:21:36,034 --> 00:21:37,000
It's not now.

414
00:21:38,275 --> 00:21:39,650
Whatever her reason is,

415
00:21:39,685 --> 00:21:41,605
helping H.G. Wells here
talk to his mommy

416
00:21:41,636 --> 00:21:42,880
ain't got nothing
to do with it.

417
00:21:44,997 --> 00:21:46,329
Come with us,
Freckles.

418
00:21:52,471 --> 00:21:53,593
The code
for the fence

419
00:21:53,633 --> 00:21:56,160
is 1-4-1, 7-1-7.

420
00:21:58,291 --> 00:21:59,493
You should take Daniel.

421
00:22:00,512 --> 00:22:02,289
It's over here for us,
anyway.

422
00:22:07,319 --> 00:22:08,106
Okay.

423
00:22:10,422 --> 00:22:11,251
Let's go.

424
00:22:12,091 --> 00:22:12,760
<i>Great.</i>

425
00:22:13,689 --> 00:22:14,775
Great.
Thank you.

426
00:22:14,810 --> 00:22:17,224
Hey, hey, Miles,
can you drive us?

427
00:22:28,341 --> 00:22:30,276
When you realize
you've made a huge mistake...

428
00:22:31,376 --> 00:22:34,245
We'll be back at the beach,
right where we started.

429
00:22:40,542 --> 00:22:41,789
All right,
the rest of us--

430
00:22:42,221 --> 00:22:44,605
Pack anything you can carry,
meet back here in 20 minutes.

431
00:22:50,817 --> 00:22:51,753
Time to go.

432
00:22:59,924 --> 00:23:02,376
These people are
not gonna be happy to see us.

433
00:23:02,674 --> 00:23:04,391
It might be a good idea
to bring some guns.

434
00:23:04,777 --> 00:23:06,324
Now, there's a gun safe
in the motor pool,

435
00:23:06,348 --> 00:23:07,183
but it's locked.

436
00:23:08,714 --> 00:23:09,990
Good thing,
I'm a janitor then.

437
00:23:11,717 --> 00:23:12,651
Hey, Dan?

438
00:23:14,253 --> 00:23:15,111
I'll meet you
at the motor pool.

439
00:23:15,142 --> 00:23:16,739
I need just a minute.
Okay?

440
00:23:37,838 --> 00:23:40,859
I'm not allowed to have
chocolate before dinner.

441
00:23:45,817 --> 00:23:47,293
It's okay, sweetheart.

442
00:23:48,687 --> 00:23:50,028
I won't tell.

443
00:23:53,525 --> 00:23:56,010
My name's Charlotte.
What's yours?

444
00:23:58,118 --> 00:23:59,512
I'm Daniel.

445
00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:02,071
I'm new here.

446
00:24:05,837 --> 00:24:06,645
Listen.

447
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:09,643
Do you know
Dr. Chang?

448
00:24:09,941 --> 00:24:10,691
Uh-huh.

449
00:24:10,731 --> 00:24:11,429
Yeah?

450
00:24:12,544 --> 00:24:14,394
Hopefully really soon,

451
00:24:14,913 --> 00:24:18,319
Dr. Chang is gonna ask
a bunch of people

452
00:24:18,354 --> 00:24:19,566
to get on
the submarine

453
00:24:20,185 --> 00:24:21,681
and leave the island.

454
00:24:22,488 --> 00:24:23,835
When he does,

455
00:24:24,073 --> 00:24:25,367
you and your mommy...

456
00:24:26,291 --> 00:24:27,919
You're gonna have
to leave.

457
00:24:28,694 --> 00:24:31,417
In case,
what I do doesn't work,

458
00:24:32,163 --> 00:24:33,701
you <i>cannot</i> be here.

459
00:24:33,701 --> 00:24:35,770
You have to leave.

460
00:24:39,077 --> 00:24:41,200
I tried to avoid
telling you this.

461
00:24:41,273 --> 00:24:43,085
I didn't think
I could change things.

462
00:24:46,644 --> 00:24:47,892
But maybe I can.

463
00:25:01,107 --> 00:25:02,664
Hey, how long will
it take us to get up there?

464
00:25:02,787 --> 00:25:03,678
Uh, it depends.

465
00:25:03,699 --> 00:25:05,510
We can take the road
until we hit the pylons,

466
00:25:05,519 --> 00:25:06,886
but then once
we're in their territory,

467
00:25:06,895 --> 00:25:08,558
- we gotta go on foot.
- Okay.

468
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:10,687
Uh, do you have
something for a beginner?

469
00:25:16,074 --> 00:25:17,475
Let's go.

470
00:25:20,279 --> 00:25:21,176
That's ready to go.

471
00:25:22,547 --> 00:25:23,539
What's going on here?

472
00:25:25,917 --> 00:25:27,736
Aren't you one of the physicists
off the sub?

473
00:25:28,987 --> 00:25:31,490
Yeah, that's right. Uh...
We were just making sure that--

474
00:25:31,491 --> 00:25:33,114
You're supposed to be out
at the Swan Site.

475
00:25:35,694 --> 00:25:37,012
Right.
Uh, there was--

476
00:25:37,629 --> 00:25:39,488
There was an accident
at the Orchid Station.

477
00:25:40,198 --> 00:25:41,323
Dr. Chang
asked us to help so--

478
00:25:41,344 --> 00:25:42,269
<i>Hey, he's got a gun.</i>

479
00:25:43,019 --> 00:25:44,822
I just <i>left</i>
Dr. Chang.

480
00:25:44,857 --> 00:25:46,431
He's at home
with his wife and baby.

481
00:25:46,432 --> 00:25:47,187
You're lying.

482
00:25:47,248 --> 00:25:50,041
Now drop the guns
and get down on the ground!

483
00:25:50,109 --> 00:25:51,538
<i>Hey.</i>
Listen to me. Listen.

484
00:25:51,584 --> 00:25:53,944
You <i>really</i> do not understand
what's happening here.

485
00:25:53,954 --> 00:25:56,099
You have no idea.
We have no time.

486
00:25:56,134 --> 00:25:56,867
We have to leave.

487
00:25:56,913 --> 00:25:58,855
All right?
So we're just gonna leave.

488
00:25:59,385 --> 00:26:01,556
Okay? Nobody's--
No..

489
00:26:02,719 --> 00:26:03,149
Aah!

490
00:26:10,589 --> 00:26:11,292
Are you okay?

491
00:26:19,129 --> 00:26:20,460
I think we can make it
to the jeep.

492
00:26:21,239 --> 00:26:22,660
All right.
I'll cover you.

493
00:26:22,665 --> 00:26:24,488
Dan?
You go, too, all right?

494
00:26:25,210 --> 00:26:25,966
Go, go, go!

495
00:26:58,777 --> 00:26:59,958
Sound the alarm!

496
00:27:28,667 --> 00:27:30,108
Hello, Daniel.

497
00:27:30,969 --> 00:27:32,239
Mother.

498
00:27:33,996 --> 00:27:35,196
When did you get here?

499
00:27:35,674 --> 00:27:36,882
Oh, I just arrived.

500
00:27:36,917 --> 00:27:38,238
I would have called you,
but...

501
00:27:39,344 --> 00:27:40,879
I would have forgotten
anyway.

502
00:27:44,350 --> 00:27:47,159
I hear you have been
offered a job.

503
00:27:49,219 --> 00:27:50,583
How do you know that?

504
00:27:51,356 --> 00:27:53,171
Well,
it's my business to know.

505
00:27:54,583 --> 00:27:56,196
I came here,
Daniel...

506
00:27:56,928 --> 00:27:59,148
To tell you that it is
very important

507
00:27:59,174 --> 00:28:01,472
that you say yes
to Mr. Widmore...

508
00:28:03,190 --> 00:28:06,332
That you accept this
opportunity.

509
00:28:08,862 --> 00:28:09,780
I can't.

510
00:28:12,948 --> 00:28:14,572
He needs someone
who can do

511
00:28:15,129 --> 00:28:17,898
really, really complex
space-time calibrations

512
00:28:17,930 --> 00:28:20,057
and calculate bearings,
and I just...

513
00:28:21,386 --> 00:28:23,268
I don't know how
to do that anymore.

514
00:28:23,550 --> 00:28:24,985
- Daniel...
- Mm.

515
00:28:25,613 --> 00:28:29,249
This place he mentioned to you,
this island--

516
00:28:30,662 --> 00:28:33,297
Did he tell you that
it could make you better?

517
00:28:38,919 --> 00:28:40,014
What if it's true?

518
00:28:40,839 --> 00:28:43,216
Why, then you could go on
with your work.

519
00:28:44,327 --> 00:28:47,202
Just think of all
you could accomplish.

520
00:28:49,705 --> 00:28:52,259
You really want me to...
to go?

521
00:28:54,717 --> 00:28:55,799
Yes.

522
00:28:59,724 --> 00:29:00,890
Will...

523
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:03,450
Will it make you
proud of me?

524
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,220
Yes, Daniel.

525
00:29:10,735 --> 00:29:11,838
It will.

526
00:29:22,881 --> 00:29:23,853
Then I'll do it.

527
00:29:41,466 --> 00:29:43,590
- You remember the code?
- Yeah, I got it.

528
00:29:44,702 --> 00:29:46,283
All right,
I'm gonna take a look at that.

529
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:49,780
Yeah, good.

530
00:29:50,009 --> 00:29:51,475
- It's just a graze.
- Whew.

531
00:29:53,657 --> 00:29:55,045
<i>This is gonna sting.</i>

532
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:55,673
Yeah.

533
00:29:57,435 --> 00:29:58,559
Ah.

534
00:29:59,518 --> 00:30:00,810
Yeah,
you're gonna be fine.

535
00:30:02,053 --> 00:30:02,974
I guess I'm lucky.

536
00:30:03,522 --> 00:30:06,021
What's luck
have to do with it?

537
00:30:06,491 --> 00:30:08,011
I thought you said
whatever happened, happened.

538
00:30:08,093 --> 00:30:09,348
You gotta understand, Jack,

539
00:30:10,495 --> 00:30:11,762
<i>This</i> is our present.

540
00:30:12,130 --> 00:30:14,065
When we met, did I have
a scar on my neck?

541
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:15,547
No.

542
00:30:16,422 --> 00:30:17,815
'Cause I hadn't been
shot yet.

543
00:30:18,698 --> 00:30:21,450
We can't be so na?ve as to think
nothing can happen to us.

544
00:30:24,609 --> 00:30:26,289
Any one of us can die,
Jack.

545
00:30:27,279 --> 00:30:27,895
<i>Okay.</i>

546
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:29,939
It's off.

547
00:30:31,883 --> 00:30:32,970
<i>Thanks.</i>

548
00:30:36,930 --> 00:30:37,924
Which way?

549
00:30:38,656 --> 00:30:39,913
Just a couple miles in.

550
00:30:48,700 --> 00:30:50,185
Do you think he knows
what he's doing?

551
00:30:51,570 --> 00:30:52,672
I sure hope so.

552
00:30:54,072 --> 00:30:55,562
There's no turning back now.

553
00:31:02,449 --> 00:31:04,743
Hey, you called it the minute
those yahoos got here.

554
00:31:05,150 --> 00:31:06,383
I shoulda listened
to you.

555
00:31:08,655 --> 00:31:10,064
You can say
I told you so.

556
00:31:10,410 --> 00:31:11,868
Maybe after
we get to the beach.

557
00:31:12,757 --> 00:31:13,400
Hey.

558
00:31:15,493 --> 00:31:16,669
You still got my back?

559
00:31:20,165 --> 00:31:21,114
You still got mine?

560
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:36,232
That's not good, right?

561
00:31:42,487 --> 00:31:43,521
LaFleur!

562
00:31:45,423 --> 00:31:47,149
- Where have you been?
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

563
00:31:47,183 --> 00:31:48,150
Take it easy, Stu.

564
00:31:48,371 --> 00:31:49,297
What the hell's going on?

565
00:31:49,322 --> 00:31:51,208
I just got shot
by a <i>physicist,</i>

566
00:31:51,588 --> 00:31:54,117
and the new recruits
are helping him.

567
00:31:54,532 --> 00:31:55,765
We've been infiltrated.

568
00:31:55,834 --> 00:31:58,591
That's ridiculous.
Now just calm down for a minute.

569
00:31:58,626 --> 00:32:00,274
We can talk about this.

570
00:32:01,991 --> 00:32:02,733
What was that?

571
00:32:03,342 --> 00:32:04,594
It sounded like
it was from outside.

572
00:32:21,650 --> 00:32:23,373
Get down
on the ground now.

573
00:32:25,364 --> 00:32:26,495
I said <i>now!</i>

574
00:32:48,620 --> 00:32:49,393
Thank you.

575
00:32:52,124 --> 00:32:53,854
You need a gun to go talk
to your mother, Dan?

576
00:32:56,928 --> 00:32:58,479
You don't know my mother,
Jack.

577
00:33:02,367 --> 00:33:04,006
You ready to tell me
why she was wrong?

578
00:33:04,569 --> 00:33:05,967
Why we don't
belong here?

579
00:33:16,314 --> 00:33:18,503
In about four hours,

580
00:33:19,183 --> 00:33:21,422
the Dharma folks
at the Swan work site--

581
00:33:21,469 --> 00:33:23,951
They're gonna--
Gonna drill into the ground

582
00:33:23,992 --> 00:33:26,779
and accidentally tap into
a massive pocket of energy.

583
00:33:27,894 --> 00:33:30,160
The result of the
release of this energy

584
00:33:30,662 --> 00:33:31,591
would be catastrophic.

585
00:33:32,674 --> 00:33:34,876
So in order to contain it,
they're gonna have to cement

586
00:33:34,933 --> 00:33:37,104
the entire area in,
like Chernobyl.

587
00:33:39,237 --> 00:33:41,516
And this containment,
the place they built over it--

588
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:43,684
I believe you called it
"The Hatch."

589
00:33:45,514 --> 00:33:46,954
The Swan Hatch?

590
00:33:49,447 --> 00:33:52,940
Because
of this one accident,

591
00:33:53,484 --> 00:33:56,217
these people are gonna spend
the next 20 years

592
00:33:56,527 --> 00:33:58,525
keeping that energy
at bay...

593
00:33:59,758 --> 00:34:00,748
by pressing a button...

594
00:34:02,882 --> 00:34:04,978
A button
that your friend Desmond

595
00:34:05,030 --> 00:34:07,736
will one day
fail to push...

596
00:34:08,967 --> 00:34:11,302
And that will cause
your plane--

597
00:34:11,403 --> 00:34:12,996
Oceanic 815--

598
00:34:14,272 --> 00:34:15,745
To crash on this island.

599
00:34:16,809 --> 00:34:18,710
And because
your plane crashed,

600
00:34:18,743 --> 00:34:20,254
a freighter will be sent
to this island--

601
00:34:20,274 --> 00:34:21,175
A freighter I was on,

602
00:34:21,186 --> 00:34:22,743
and Charlotte was on
and so forth.

603
00:34:22,852 --> 00:34:24,335
This entire chain of events--

604
00:34:25,002 --> 00:34:27,655
It's gonna start happening
this afternoon.

605
00:34:29,448 --> 00:34:30,285
But...

606
00:34:30,946 --> 00:34:32,636
We can change that.

607
00:34:33,725 --> 00:34:36,600
I studied relativistic physics
my entire life.

608
00:34:36,748 --> 00:34:39,078
One thing emerged
over and over--

609
00:34:39,831 --> 00:34:41,494
Can't change the past.
Can't do it.

610
00:34:41,525 --> 00:34:44,151
Whatever happened, happened.
All right?

611
00:34:44,936 --> 00:34:47,366
But then,
I finally realized...

612
00:34:48,973 --> 00:34:50,714
I had been spending
so much time

613
00:34:51,220 --> 00:34:53,214
focused on the constants,

614
00:34:53,763 --> 00:34:55,206
I forgot
about the variables.

615
00:34:57,320 --> 00:34:59,435
Do you know what the variables
in these equations are, Jack?

616
00:35:00,284 --> 00:35:01,687
No.

617
00:35:02,109 --> 00:35:02,658
Us.

618
00:35:03,928 --> 00:35:04,899
We're the variables.

619
00:35:05,410 --> 00:35:06,038
People.

620
00:35:06,882 --> 00:35:08,155
<i>We think.
We reason.</i>

621
00:35:08,183 --> 00:35:10,015
We make choices.
We have free will.

622
00:35:11,236 --> 00:35:13,925
We can <i>change</i>
our destiny.

623
00:35:17,467 --> 00:35:19,643
I think
I can negate that energy...

624
00:35:20,102 --> 00:35:21,247
under the Swan.

625
00:35:21,940 --> 00:35:23,214
I think I can destroy it.

626
00:35:24,377 --> 00:35:28,147
If I can, then that hatch
will never be built,

627
00:35:28,246 --> 00:35:29,380
and your plane...

628
00:35:30,403 --> 00:35:31,563
Your plane will land,

629
00:35:32,384 --> 00:35:33,678
just like
it's supposed to,

630
00:35:34,519 --> 00:35:35,564
in Los Angeles.

631
00:35:41,679 --> 00:35:45,171
And just how exactly do you plan on
destroying this energy?

632
00:35:48,511 --> 00:35:50,481
I'm gonna detonate
a hydrogen bomb.

633
00:36:03,678 --> 00:36:05,060
<i>Satellite pharmacy...</i>

634
00:36:05,803 --> 00:36:07,282
Daniel Faraday?

635
00:36:07,650 --> 00:36:09,902
Your son is Daniel Faraday?

636
00:36:11,287 --> 00:36:11,999
Yes.

637
00:36:13,168 --> 00:36:16,762
That's the man who sent Desmond
to Los Angeles to find you.

638
00:36:16,783 --> 00:36:17,557
That's right.

639
00:36:19,118 --> 00:36:21,448
I came, Penelope,
to apologize.

640
00:36:22,643 --> 00:36:26,690
Your husband
has become a casualty

641
00:36:26,818 --> 00:36:29,080
in a conflict that's
bigger than him,

642
00:36:29,111 --> 00:36:30,375
that's bigger than
any of us.

643
00:36:30,381 --> 00:36:31,928
What do you mean?
Is Des gonna be okay?

644
00:36:32,781 --> 00:36:33,759
I don't know.

645
00:36:35,692 --> 00:36:37,627
For the first time
in a long time,

646
00:36:38,461 --> 00:36:40,642
I don't know
what's going to happen next.

647
00:36:43,026 --> 00:36:43,831
<i>Ms. Hume?</i>

648
00:36:44,136 --> 00:36:44,762
Yes?

649
00:36:45,425 --> 00:36:46,894
Your husband's
in the recovery room,

650
00:36:46,929 --> 00:36:48,167
<i>and he's asking
for you.</i>

651
00:36:48,196 --> 00:36:49,151
The recovery room?
Is he--

652
00:36:49,175 --> 00:36:50,303
He's doing fine.

653
00:36:50,597 --> 00:36:51,381
<i>Come with me.</i>

654
00:36:51,585 --> 00:36:52,845
This nurse will
watch your son.

655
00:37:07,342 --> 00:37:08,279
Hi.

656
00:37:10,896 --> 00:37:11,586
Hi.

657
00:37:14,364 --> 00:37:15,702
I thought I'd lost you.

658
00:37:20,531 --> 00:37:21,785
I promised you,
Penny.

659
00:37:23,415 --> 00:37:24,847
I promised you...

660
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:30,244
I'd never
leave you again.

661
00:37:47,340 --> 00:37:48,312
<i>Is he all right?</i>

662
00:37:53,079 --> 00:37:54,119
Yes, Charles.

663
00:37:54,905 --> 00:37:55,740
He's fine.

664
00:37:57,837 --> 00:37:58,435
Good.

665
00:38:00,218 --> 00:38:01,368
Your daughter's in there.

666
00:38:01,988 --> 00:38:03,732
Why don't you go in
and say hello?

667
00:38:04,290 --> 00:38:05,672
Unfortunately,
Eloise...

668
00:38:06,042 --> 00:38:07,479
My relationship
with Penelope

669
00:38:07,494 --> 00:38:09,666
is one of the things
I had to sacrifice.

670
00:38:10,529 --> 00:38:11,780
Sacrifice?

671
00:38:12,567 --> 00:38:15,652
Don't you talk to me
about sacrifice, Charles.

672
00:38:16,381 --> 00:38:18,791
I had to send my son
back to the island,

673
00:38:18,856 --> 00:38:21,391
- knowing full well that--
- He was my son, too, Eloise.

674
00:38:44,675 --> 00:38:45,739
This is a mistake.

675
00:38:47,319 --> 00:38:47,948
<i>He's talking about</i>

676
00:38:47,973 --> 00:38:50,284
erasing everything that's
ever happened to us, Jack.

677
00:38:50,610 --> 00:38:51,544
It's insane.

678
00:38:52,018 --> 00:38:53,689
We disappeared off a plane
in mid-air

679
00:38:53,714 --> 00:38:55,466
and ended up in 1977.

680
00:38:55,927 --> 00:38:57,531
I'm getting kinda used
to insane.

681
00:38:57,977 --> 00:38:59,259
<i>Well,
that should be enough.</i>

682
00:39:04,721 --> 00:39:06,010
<i>I think
we need more water.</i>

683
00:39:16,654 --> 00:39:17,510
Wish me luck.

684
00:39:18,077 --> 00:39:20,002
- Wait. Hey.
- No, let him go. Let him go.

685
00:39:39,559 --> 00:39:41,887
Back up.
Step away. It's okay.

686
00:39:42,922 --> 00:39:44,000
Nobody move.

687
00:39:44,556 --> 00:39:46,169
I only want
to speak to Eloise.

688
00:39:48,594 --> 00:39:49,788
Where is Eloise?

689
00:39:50,930 --> 00:39:52,140
Come on.
Where is she?

690
00:39:52,747 --> 00:39:53,862
<i>I'm sorry,
but Elo--</i>

691
00:39:56,345 --> 00:39:57,295
She's not here
right now.

692
00:40:01,798 --> 00:40:02,740
Do we know each other?

693
00:40:04,749 --> 00:40:05,592
It doesn't matter.

694
00:40:06,512 --> 00:40:08,137
I need you
to take me to Eloise.

695
00:40:08,411 --> 00:40:09,941
I-I already told you.
She's not here.

696
00:40:09,973 --> 00:40:11,488
- Let's just take it easy.
- Where's the bomb, Richard?

697
00:40:12,857 --> 00:40:14,600
The hydrogen bomb
that I told you people to bury--

698
00:40:14,626 --> 00:40:15,337
Where is it?

699
00:40:16,974 --> 00:40:17,442
Listen to me.

700
00:40:17,462 --> 00:40:19,485
Lower your gun,
and we'll talk. Okay?

701
00:40:19,606 --> 00:40:21,795
Nobody has to get hurt here.
Just put the gun down.

702
00:40:21,909 --> 00:40:23,537
I'm gonna give you
three seconds.

703
00:40:25,082 --> 00:40:27,012
- One...
- Don't do this.

704
00:40:27,264 --> 00:40:27,833
Two...

705
00:40:41,851 --> 00:40:43,876
- Why did you do that?
- He had a gun on you.

706
00:40:43,950 --> 00:40:45,290
He wasn't gonna shoot me,
Eloise.

707
00:40:48,076 --> 00:40:49,642
<i>Eloise.</i>

708
00:40:54,618 --> 00:40:56,043
You knew.

709
00:40:57,630 --> 00:40:59,113
