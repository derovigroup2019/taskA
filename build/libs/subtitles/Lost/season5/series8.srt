1
00:00:00,281 --> 00:00:01,520
Previously on "Lost"...

2
00:00:02,390 --> 00:00:03,210
Now talk.

3
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:06,220
Think of the island
like a record spinning on a turntable,

4
00:00:06,470 --> 00:00:08,780
only now,
that record is skipping.

5
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:11,900
Whatever Ben Linus did
down at the Orchid Station,

6
00:00:12,110 --> 00:00:14,990
It may have... dislodged us.

7
00:00:15,590 --> 00:00:17,280
Dislodged us from what?

8
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:18,720
Time.

9
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:23,130
- Come on!
- Aah!

10
00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:25,560
- What's goin' on?
- It's not stopping!

11
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:29,300
Charlotte!

12
00:00:33,830 --> 00:00:35,630
We have to go back to the Orchid.

13
00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:38,030
That's where all this started.
Maybe it's where it'll all stop.

14
00:00:38,330 --> 00:00:40,595
This is all happening because they left.

15
00:00:40,795 --> 00:00:42,650
I think it'll stop
if I can bring them back.

16
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:43,550
Bring who back?

17
00:00:43,670 --> 00:00:46,100
Jack, Sun, Sayid, Hugo, Kate.

18
00:00:46,349 --> 00:00:47,980
Don't you want her to come back?

19
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:53,115
You sure you don't
want us to lower you down?

20
00:00:53,165 --> 00:00:55,060
Where would be the fun in that?

21
00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:00,760
Uh-oh.

22
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:03,030

23
00:01:03,130 --> 00:01:05,030
John! Damn it, hold on!

24
00:01:05,130 --> 00:01:06,460
Aah!

25
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:12,800
I think you can let go of that now.

26
00:01:19,430 --> 00:01:20,665
No.

27
00:01:20,865 --> 00:01:22,530
No! No! No! No! No!

28
00:01:22,630 --> 00:01:24,165
James, don't.

29
00:01:24,265 --> 00:01:26,145
Come on! Help me!

30
00:01:28,745 --> 00:01:30,630
James...

31
00:01:30,730 --> 00:01:32,430
Stop.

32
00:01:32,830 --> 00:01:34,565
We can't help him.

33
00:01:34,665 --> 00:01:37,230
Wherever John went, he's gone.

34
00:01:37,630 --> 00:01:40,965
And wherever we are is before
that well was ever built.

35
00:01:41,265 --> 00:01:42,695
Yeah, I'd say way before.

36
00:01:44,995 --> 00:01:47,030
What makes you--?

37
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:07,465
James!

38
00:02:07,565 --> 00:02:09,530
Can you hear me?!

39
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:11,500
Can anyone hear me?!

40
00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:17,500

41
00:02:44,111 --> 00:02:45,862

42
00:02:45,912 --> 00:02:47,665
What the hell was that?

43
00:02:48,465 --> 00:02:51,195
That one was different. It was...

44
00:02:51,595 --> 00:02:53,905
That was more like an earthquake.

45
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:58,560
- Locke!
- James, wait!

46
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:10,300
Great.

47
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:21,530
My headache is gone.

48
00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:24,330
Yeah, mine is, too.

49
00:03:24,430 --> 00:03:26,500
And my nose isn't bleeding anymore.

50
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,030
I think it's over.

51
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:40,900
I think John did it.

52
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:48,760
Now what?

53
00:03:52,330 --> 00:03:54,130
Now we wait for him to come back.

54
00:03:56,330 --> 00:03:57,930
For how long?

55
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:06,760
As long as it takes.

56
00:04:09,915 --> 00:04:12,715

57
00:04:26,611 --> 00:04:28,711

58
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:36,460
<i>Are you kidding me?</i>

59
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:39,270
I'm gone ten minutes,
and you're having a hootenanny?

60
00:04:39,450 --> 00:04:40,650
Don't be such a bummer, man.

61
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:43,195
Rosie was just dropping off some brownies.

62
00:04:43,395 --> 00:04:45,665
- You should thank her.
- Yeah.

63
00:04:45,765 --> 00:04:47,965
She shouldn't be here, Jerry.
We're on the clock, man.

64
00:04:48,265 --> 00:04:49,722
Ah, mellow out, Phil.

65
00:04:49,772 --> 00:04:51,565
W... what's gonna happen, huh?

66
00:04:51,665 --> 00:04:54,270
The polar bears are gonna figure
a way out of their cages? 

67
00:04:54,330 --> 00:04:55,130
That's not the point.

68
00:04:55,230 --> 00:04:56,800
If Lafleur finds out what you're doing--

69
00:04:56,850 --> 00:04:58,615
<i>- Lafleur's not gonna find out anything.<i>
<i>- It's gonna be my ass, man.</i>

70
00:04:58,665 --> 00:05:00,595
<i>- I'm the one who's gonna have to answer to him.</i>
- Guys?

71
00:05:00,695 --> 00:05:03,430
- Relax, man. Nobody's gonna find out.
- Guys. What...

72
00:05:06,930 --> 00:05:07,995
No.

73
00:05:09,795 --> 00:05:11,095
Is that a hostile?

74
00:05:11,195 --> 00:05:12,560
I don't know.

75
00:05:13,033 --> 00:05:14,333
"Overload"

76
00:05:16,333 --> 00:05:17,330
Is that...

77
00:05:18,130 --> 00:05:19,600
...Horace?

78
00:05:29,115 --> 00:05:30,415

79
00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:38,570
Oh, he's got dynamite.

80
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:40,041
Get her out of here!
Get her out of here now! Now! 

81
00:05:40,091 --> 00:05:41,260
Come on, Rosie.
We gotta get you out of here.

82
00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:43,360
- I told you not to bring her here. I told you!
- Go. go!

83
00:05:44,050 --> 00:05:45,030
Ok. This is bad.
This is bad, man.

84
00:05:45,170 --> 00:05:46,000
We gotta get LaFleur.

85
00:05:46,050 --> 00:05:47,510
3:00 in the morning.
Do you really wanna wake LaFleur up?

86
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:48,740
- No, of course not, but--
- No.

87
00:05:48,790 --> 00:05:49,870
Maybe we can handle this ourselves, huh?

88
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:52,940
And maybe Horace blows himself up and
LaFleur kills us for not waking him.

89
00:05:53,690 --> 00:05:55,320
We gotta go now!

90
00:06:02,447 --> 00:06:03,547

91
00:06:03,647 --> 00:06:04,630
Do you wanna knock?

92
00:06:05,330 --> 00:06:06,730
You knock.

93
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:09,730
Fine.

94
00:06:12,610 --> 00:06:13,710

95
00:06:18,938 --> 00:06:19,738

96
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:20,865
What?

97
00:06:20,965 --> 00:06:22,630
Mr. LaFleur, sorry to bother you,

98
00:06:22,730 --> 00:06:25,230
but we got a situation
out at the pylons.

99
00:06:27,330 --> 00:06:28,965
What kind of situation?

100
00:06:29,665 --> 00:06:31,165
Uh, it's, uh, Horace.

101
00:06:31,265 --> 00:06:33,800
He's got dynamite,
and he's blowing up trees.

102
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:39,300
Son of a bitch.

105
00:07:02,588 --> 00:07:04,430
Relax! I'm comin'!

106
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:11,480
Hey, boss.

107
00:07:12,025 --> 00:07:14,530
Evening, Enos.
You got your zapper with ya?

108
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:16,900
Yep. You wanna tell me why I need it?

109
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:21,415
'Cause our fearless leader is out
blowing up trees.

110
00:07:21,615 --> 00:07:23,415
Why's he doing that?

111
00:07:24,115 --> 00:07:25,680
'Cause he's loaded.

112
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:27,615
Since when does Horace drink?

113
00:07:28,015 --> 00:07:31,100
He doesn't, so we're gonna keep
this on the down low.

114
00:07:44,330 --> 00:07:45,880
Oh, man.

115
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:48,580
All right. You put out that fire.

116
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:50,580
Pack up this dynamite.
I'll take him home.

117
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:52,410
Why don't you put out
the fire, pack up and...

118
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:53,990
and I'll take him home?

119
00:07:54,090 --> 00:07:55,990
You wanna tell Amy where we found him?

120
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:02,430
Help me get him up.

121
00:08:03,613 --> 00:08:04,413

122
00:08:07,930 --> 00:08:09,545
Oh, my God. Is he okay?

123
00:08:09,645 --> 00:08:10,874
You tell me.

124
00:08:10,924 --> 00:08:12,600
Bring him inside.

125
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:17,100
The couch.
The couch is fine.

126
00:08:22,830 --> 00:08:25,080
Oh. Where'd you find him?

127
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:27,915
By the flame, blowing up
trees with dynamite.

128
00:08:29,015 --> 00:08:30,715
Wanna tell me why?

129
00:08:31,815 --> 00:08:33,580
We had a fight.

130
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:35,515
Must've been a doozy.

131
00:08:35,815 --> 00:08:37,315
Please, Jim.

132
00:08:38,015 --> 00:08:39,905
- It's personal.
- Personal?

133
00:08:40,015 --> 00:08:42,115
You think this isn't gonna get out?

134
00:08:42,215 --> 00:08:44,215
It'll be on the coconut telegraph
by breakfast.

135
00:08:46,314 --> 00:08:47,414

136
00:08:48,630 --> 00:08:50,330
It was about Paul.

137
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:53,915
Go on.

138
00:08:54,015 --> 00:08:55,780
Oh...

139
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,830
What's the matter? You okay?

140
00:08:58,383 --> 00:08:59,583

141
00:08:59,783 --> 00:09:01,630
The baby... it's coming.

142
00:09:06,930 --> 00:09:08,230
Oh, hell.

143
00:09:09,647 --> 00:09:12,447

144
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:18,515
No, no no.
I'm not... gonna tell her.

145
00:09:18,615 --> 00:09:20,960
I don't wanna do it, I don't
wanna tell her. I won't.

146
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:25,700
- Where's Red?
- I don't know.

147
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:30,615
No. I won't do it.
I won't tell her.

148
00:09:30,715 --> 00:09:33,215
- I won't do it. Won't...
- Daniel?

149
00:09:34,515 --> 00:09:36,000
You okay?

150
00:09:38,930 --> 00:09:41,715
I'm not gonna do it.
I'm not gonna tell her.

151
00:09:41,815 --> 00:09:44,715
Daniel, where's Charlotte?

152
00:09:46,115 --> 00:09:47,430
She's not here.

153
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:51,445
She...

154
00:09:51,545 --> 00:09:53,280
She's gone.

155
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:55,480
Where?

156
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:58,380
She's... dead.

157
00:09:58,780 --> 00:10:00,280
She's dead.

158
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:03,380
There was another flash, and...

159
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:06,845
And she was... She was just gone.

160
00:10:07,745 --> 00:10:10,900
Her... body just...

161
00:10:12,675 --> 00:10:13,875

162
00:10:14,330 --> 00:10:15,630
...disappeared.

163
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:21,760
She moved on, and we stayed.

164
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:26,415
I'm so sorry.

165
00:10:26,615 --> 00:10:29,445
Hold on. Wait a minute.
We "stayed"?

166
00:10:30,045 --> 00:10:32,715
We're not traveling through time anymore?
You saying it's over?

167
00:10:32,815 --> 00:10:34,645
Of course it's over.

168
00:10:35,245 --> 00:10:37,245
Wherever we are now,

169
00:10:38,845 --> 00:10:40,730
whenever we are now...

170
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:48,230
we're here for good.

171
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:54,215
- I won't do it.
- Okay. Okay.

172
00:10:54,315 --> 00:10:57,145
- I won't. I'm not gonna... I'm...
- Okay.

173
00:10:57,245 --> 00:11:00,030
I'm not gonna...I won't...

174
00:11:02,930 --> 00:11:04,180
Okay. Swell.

175
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:05,680
Until Dan checks back in,

176
00:11:05,780 --> 00:11:07,680
I say we head back to the beach.

177
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:09,315
When Locke gets back with everybody,

178
00:11:09,415 --> 00:11:10,730
that's where they'll be looking for us.

179
00:11:10,780 --> 00:11:11,780
The beach?

180
00:11:11,930 --> 00:11:14,910
What, you didn't get enough
flaming arrows shot at you?

181
00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:17,100
And your camp is gone.

182
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:18,600
Why bother?

183
00:11:20,030 --> 00:11:21,580
Sawyer's right, Miles.

184
00:11:23,130 --> 00:11:24,440
We should go back to the beach.

185
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:26,530
We survived there before.
We can do it again.

186
00:11:26,650 --> 00:11:27,640
Or maybe when we get there,

187
00:11:27,870 --> 00:11:30,290
you'll... you'll wanna go
back to the Orchid again.

188
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:32,630
And then when that gets boring,
we can head back to the beach.

189
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:34,250
It's the only two plans you people have.

190
00:11:34,510 --> 00:11:36,930
Hey, zip it. I'm heading back to the beach.

191
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,850
If our stuff's there, great.
If not, we build new stuff.

192
00:11:40,570 --> 00:11:42,560
You don't like the plan, good luck.

193
00:11:45,930 --> 00:11:48,160
Who put him in charge?

194
00:12:00,630 --> 00:12:03,180
Thanks for getting my back
with that whole beach issue.

195
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:05,480
You should thank me.
It was a stupid idea.

196
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:10,045
Well, what does that say
about you agreeing with me?

197
00:12:10,145 --> 00:12:11,845
Any plan is better than no plan.

198
00:12:11,945 --> 00:12:13,545
Besides, if I hadn't agreed with you,

199
00:12:13,645 --> 00:12:15,545
we'd still be arguing about where to go next.

200
00:12:16,345 --> 00:12:18,880
I just hope you figure out
something better before we get there.

201
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:22,560
 Well, I'm open to suggestions.

202
00:12:24,611 --> 00:12:26,011

203
00:12:30,937 --> 00:12:32,937
Help! Help!

204
00:12:35,331 --> 00:12:36,631
Help...

205
00:12:39,030 --> 00:12:41,220
Oh, no! No, Paul!

206
00:12:41,636 --> 00:12:43,680
Oh, God! Oh, God!
 No, no, no, no!

207
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:46,200
No, please! We didn't know!

208
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,345
Paul, please,
please do something. No, no.

209
00:12:50,445 --> 00:12:52,480
No, no, no, no, no.
We were just touring this park.

210
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:55,545
We didn't mean anything.
We were just having... Paul.

211
00:12:56,545 --> 00:12:58,615
Paul, please.

212
00:12:58,715 --> 00:13:00,880
Oh, my God! No!

213
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:04,560
No, Paul, please. Please.

214
00:13:04,730 --> 00:13:06,480
Who do you think they are?

215
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:09,345
Who cares who they are?
We don't even know when they are.

216
00:13:09,845 --> 00:13:11,180
Hey.

217
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:12,415
Dan.

218
00:13:12,515 --> 00:13:15,545
We don't get involved, right?
That's what you said.

219
00:13:16,645 --> 00:13:18,915
It doesn't matter what we do.

220
00:13:20,015 --> 00:13:22,680
Whatever happened, happened.

221
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:26,580
Yeah, thanks anyway, Plato.

222
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:29,515
I'm going over there.
You still got my back?

223
00:13:29,615 --> 00:13:31,145
Absolutely.

224
00:13:32,945 --> 00:13:35,397
Paul, Paul. Talk to me!
Talk to me, Paul!

225
00:13:35,447 --> 00:13:37,307
On your feet!

226
00:13:37,447 --> 00:13:38,915
- No, I can't! I can't!
- Come on, get up! Now!

227
00:13:39,015 --> 00:13:40,445
- Aah! 
- Up!

228
00:13:40,545 --> 00:13:42,245
All right, drop the gun!

229
00:13:42,419 --> 00:13:43,419

230
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:45,930
Oh, God...

231
00:13:50,381 --> 00:13:51,481

232
00:13:56,679 --> 00:13:57,879

233
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:11,045
It's all right.

234
00:14:11,145 --> 00:14:14,016
It's okay. You're safe.

235
00:14:14,066 --> 00:14:15,300
It's over.

236
00:14:19,230 --> 00:14:20,660
Who are you?

237
00:14:32,597 --> 00:14:33,797

238
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:37,880
Her friend's wearing a Dharma jumpsuit.

239
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:39,715
That put us '70s, '80s.

240
00:14:39,815 --> 00:14:41,867
The guys with the bags... Others?

241
00:14:41,917 --> 00:14:42,745
Beats me.

242
00:14:42,845 --> 00:14:44,571
What, y'all don't know each other?

243
00:14:44,621 --> 00:14:45,871
Before my time.

244
00:14:46,645 --> 00:14:47,945
Sawyer.

245
00:14:48,145 --> 00:14:49,430
Walkie.

246
00:14:51,030 --> 00:14:52,115
We need to go.

247
00:14:52,215 --> 00:14:53,315
I'm on it.

248
00:14:55,815 --> 00:14:58,745
Listen, sweetheart, we gotta get moving now.

249
00:14:59,245 --> 00:15:00,915
Who are you people?

250
00:15:02,015 --> 00:15:03,945
Our ship wrecked here
on the way to Tahiti,

251
00:15:04,045 --> 00:15:05,945
But that ain't important right now,

252
00:15:06,045 --> 00:15:07,945
'Cause whoever's on the other end of this...

253
00:15:08,045 --> 00:15:10,715
those two might've given 'em
a call before we saved you.

254
00:15:12,315 --> 00:15:14,145
We have to bury them.

255
00:15:14,245 --> 00:15:16,335
Bury them? We ain't got
time to bury nobody.

256
00:15:16,385 --> 00:15:18,015
We have to. The truce.

257
00:15:18,515 --> 00:15:20,045
Oh, God.

258
00:15:20,145 --> 00:15:21,845
We have to bury them.

259
00:15:22,045 --> 00:15:24,315
And... and we have...

260
00:15:24,615 --> 00:15:25,815
we have...

261
00:15:25,915 --> 00:15:28,045
And we have to bring it--
him back home.

262
00:15:28,745 --> 00:15:31,515
We have to bring Paul back with us.

263
00:15:31,615 --> 00:15:33,080
Please.

264
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:36,315
Please?

265
00:15:37,315 --> 00:15:38,800
Please.

266
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,230
I'll carry him.

267
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:47,480
All right, we'll put these
guys in the ground

268
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:50,180
and carry your friend back,
but we better do it fast.

269
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:52,900
He wasn't... my friend.

270
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:58,530
He was my husband.

271
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:13,045
All right, listen up.

272
00:16:13,145 --> 00:16:15,815
When we get there,
there's gonna be a lot of questions.

273
00:16:15,915 --> 00:16:18,045
So just keep your mouth shut.
Let me do the talking. 

274
00:16:18,145 --> 00:16:20,980
You really think you can convince
them that we were in a boat wreck?

275
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:23,445
I'm a professional.
I used to lie for a living.

276
00:16:23,945 --> 00:16:25,260
Daniel! Stop!

277
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:46,915
Turn it off.

278
00:16:47,515 --> 00:16:48,362
Turn what off?

279
00:16:48,412 --> 00:16:49,345
Whatever that is.

280
00:16:49,445 --> 00:16:51,915
It looks like some sort of
sonic fence or something.

281
00:16:54,515 --> 00:16:56,415
Where did you say your ship was going?

282
00:16:56,515 --> 00:16:58,345
Listen, sister, we're the ones
who just saved your life

283
00:16:58,445 --> 00:16:59,515
and hid those bodies.

284
00:16:59,615 --> 00:17:02,115
So how about you trust us and
turn that damn thing off?

285
00:17:04,715 --> 00:17:05,745
Okay.

286
00:17:06,345 --> 00:17:07,600
Okay, fine.

287
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:21,280
A "sonic fence"? Didn't I say
let me do the talking?

288
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:23,168
One more step,
Dan would've fried his brain.

289
00:17:23,318 --> 00:17:24,915
His brain's already fried.

290
00:17:25,915 --> 00:17:27,460
Okay, it's off.

291
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:35,800
You first.

292
00:17:38,848 --> 00:17:40,448

293
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:43,715
See? It's fine.

294
00:17:45,315 --> 00:17:47,045
All right, let's go.

295
00:17:47,145 --> 00:17:49,760
And going forward, we should all do
 a better job of trustin'--Uh!

296
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:52,759

297
00:18:02,212 --> 00:18:05,012

298
00:18:06,577 --> 00:18:07,977

299
00:18:09,477 --> 00:18:10,845
It hurts! Oh!

300
00:18:11,145 --> 00:18:14,030
You're gonna be okay, Amy.
Just try and relax.

301
00:18:17,150 --> 00:18:17,880
Where's Horace?

302
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:19,460
Does he know his wife's in labor?

303
00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:21,140
He's unavailable.

304
00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:23,430
Look, Amy's in a very dangerous
situation. The baby's breeched.

305
00:18:23,690 --> 00:18:24,530
What the hell does that mean?

306
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:26,110
It's upside down. She needs a Caesarean.

307
00:18:26,290 --> 00:18:27,750
Well, don't tell me about it. Just do it.

308
00:18:27,930 --> 00:18:29,430
I'm an internist, not an obstetrician.

309
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:31,410
Our women always deliver on the mainland.

310
00:18:31,550 --> 00:18:32,910
Amy was supposed to get on the sub on Tuesday.

311
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:34,440
The baby's two weeks early.

312
00:18:34,575 --> 00:18:37,275

313
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:38,850
Can you deliver this baby or not?

314
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:40,810
I don't know.

315
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:53,000
Hey, man. Where is she?

316
00:18:56,692 --> 00:18:58,093

317
00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:04,212
What's up?

318
00:19:04,362 --> 00:19:05,845
Amy's having her baby.

319
00:19:06,945 --> 00:19:08,145
What?

320
00:19:08,245 --> 00:19:09,845
Did you hear me?

321
00:19:09,945 --> 00:19:11,515
She's in trouble.

322
00:19:11,615 --> 00:19:14,115
Doc says she needs a Caesarean.

323
00:19:14,815 --> 00:19:17,565
- We had an agreement.
- Screw our agreement.

324
00:19:17,615 --> 00:19:19,980
He ain't never done one.
I'm guessing you have.

325
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:22,980
Don't you understand that every time

326
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:25,330
I try to help a woman on this island give birth,

327
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:27,515
It hasn't worked?

328
00:19:28,415 --> 00:19:31,330
Well, maybe whatever made that
happen hasn't happened yet.

329
00:19:32,830 --> 00:19:35,080
You gotta try. You gotta help her.

330
00:19:35,180 --> 00:19:37,160
You're the only one that can.

331
00:19:46,030 --> 00:19:48,080
- The baby's breeched.
- Yes, but...

332
00:19:48,180 --> 00:19:50,045
 Did you try an external cephalic version?

333
00:19:50,145 --> 00:19:51,880
- What? No.
- I... It's probably too late.

334
00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:54,330
I'm gonna need a number 12 scalpel,
14-gauge sutures...

335
00:19:54,380 --> 00:19:57,245
half-round if you've got them...
and an epidural anesthetic.

336
00:19:57,345 --> 00:19:59,615
You're gonna need? Where is Horace?

337
00:19:59,715 --> 00:20:01,315
I'm speaking for Horace now,

338
00:20:01,415 --> 00:20:03,180
and I say she's delivering this baby.

339
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:04,463
I don't think it's a good idea.

340
00:20:04,613 --> 00:20:07,445
I want her. I want her to do it.

341
00:20:07,645 --> 00:20:09,515

342
00:20:10,915 --> 00:20:12,660
You heard the lady.

343
00:20:17,660 --> 00:20:19,880
Listen... You're gonna do great.

344
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:22,660
I know you are.

345
00:20:24,930 --> 00:20:26,100
Okay.

346
00:20:27,945 --> 00:20:29,645
Okay. Shhh...

347
00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:44,945
Is everything okay?

348
00:20:45,545 --> 00:20:47,115
Amy went into labor.

349
00:20:47,515 --> 00:20:49,215
I know.

350
00:20:49,315 --> 00:20:50,645
Is she okay?

351
00:20:50,745 --> 00:20:52,645
I don't know. There's a problem.

352
00:20:53,345 --> 00:20:55,580
- Juliet's in there.
- Juliet?

353
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:57,830
I pulled her out of retirement.

354
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:02,845
Any luck?

355
00:21:03,145 --> 00:21:05,215
We finished grid 1-3-3 today.

356
00:21:05,315 --> 00:21:07,015
No sign of our people.

357
00:21:07,215 --> 00:21:08,780
No one.

358
00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:11,860
Well, 1-3-4 then.

359
00:21:15,330 --> 00:21:17,480
How long do we look, James?

360
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:20,560
As long as it takes.

361
00:21:28,060 --> 00:21:29,680
What happened?

362
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:32,245
It's a boy.

363
00:21:33,045 --> 00:21:35,415
He's okay? She's okay?

364
00:21:36,915 --> 00:21:39,300
Everyone's okay.

365
00:21:52,134 --> 00:21:53,334

366
00:22:01,460 --> 00:22:03,080
How's your head?

367
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:06,030
It hurts.

368
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:10,815
- Where are my people?
- They're fine.

369
00:22:11,315 --> 00:22:13,380
Amy told me what happened in the jungle,

370
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:15,115
and I really appreciate what you did.

371
00:22:15,215 --> 00:22:17,815
Well, y'all got a funny way
of showing your appreciation.

372
00:22:18,215 --> 00:22:20,115
Look, we have a certain defense protocol.

373
00:22:20,815 --> 00:22:22,945
There are hostile indigenous
people on this island,

374
00:22:23,045 --> 00:22:24,945
and we don't get along with them.

375
00:22:25,045 --> 00:22:28,130
So... why don't you tell me
who the hell you are?

376
00:22:31,730 --> 00:22:34,645
My name's James LaFleur.
You can call me Jim.

377
00:22:34,745 --> 00:22:36,645
How did you get to the island, Jim?

378
00:22:38,745 --> 00:22:40,880
If my friends are safe, why are you
asking me all the questions?

379
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:43,115
They told me I need to talk to you,

380
00:22:43,215 --> 00:22:45,115
that you're the boat captain.

381
00:22:47,215 --> 00:22:48,915
We got caught in a storm.

382
00:22:49,015 --> 00:22:50,545
Our ship wrecked.

383
00:22:50,645 --> 00:22:52,380
Must've hit the reef.

384
00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:56,015
Thankfully, we washed up on shore.

385
00:22:56,915 --> 00:22:58,645
What kind of ship?

386
00:22:58,745 --> 00:23:00,415
A salvage vessel.

387
00:23:00,815 --> 00:23:03,480
We were searching for
a famous lost wreck.

388
00:23:03,580 --> 00:23:05,880
It's an old slaver
out of Portsmouth, England,

389
00:23:05,980 --> 00:23:07,615
called "the Black Rock."

390
00:23:08,015 --> 00:23:09,645
You heard of her?

391
00:23:09,945 --> 00:23:11,915
Can't say that I have.

392
00:23:13,715 --> 00:23:16,015
So... once you got washed ashore,

393
00:23:16,115 --> 00:23:18,980
why were you then wandering
around in the jungle?

394
00:23:19,580 --> 00:23:22,015
Some of our crew were missing.
We were looking for them.

395
00:23:22,115 --> 00:23:24,441
That's when we came
upon your girl instead.

396
00:23:24,591 --> 00:23:25,460
Hmm.

397
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:30,380
Well... I tell you what, Jim.

398
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:32,718
If your crew shows up,
we'll send them along with you.

399
00:23:32,868 --> 00:23:34,180
Send them where?

400
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:36,165
There's a submarine
that leaves this island

401
00:23:36,215 --> 00:23:37,745
 first thing in the morning.

402
00:23:37,845 --> 00:23:39,945
You and your friends,
you're gonna get on it.

403
00:23:40,045 --> 00:23:42,045
It's gonna drop you off in Tahiti.

404
00:23:42,145 --> 00:23:44,633
You can find your way home from there.

405
00:23:44,683 --> 00:23:46,245
Hold on a minute, Chief.

406
00:23:46,345 --> 00:23:48,180
We just saved that woman's life.

407
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:50,695
Doesn't that earn us a week or two
to find the rest of our people?

408
00:23:50,845 --> 00:23:51,815
 Nope.

409
00:23:51,915 --> 00:23:54,245
The only people that are allowed
to stay on this compound

410
00:23:54,345 --> 00:23:56,280
are members of the Dharma Initiative.

411
00:23:56,980 --> 00:24:00,895
And look, I don't want you to take this
the wrong way, please, Jim,

412
00:24:01,045 --> 00:24:03,100
but you are not Dharma material.

413
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:10,115
We're screwed.

414
00:24:10,415 --> 00:24:13,315
He's probably trying to
explain time travel by now.

415
00:24:13,415 --> 00:24:15,380
Sawyer's gonna be fine.

416
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:17,200
What are you lookin' at?

417
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:23,645
I lived here for over three years.

418
00:24:23,745 --> 00:24:25,680
That was my house over there.

419
00:24:25,780 --> 00:24:27,980
You were in the Dharma Initiative?

420
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:30,015
No.

421
00:24:30,115 --> 00:24:32,045
The Others took over these barracks

422
00:24:32,145 --> 00:24:34,680
and wiped out most of the
people living in them.

423
00:24:34,780 --> 00:24:37,415
They brought me here on a sub
a long time after that.

424
00:24:38,915 --> 00:24:41,760
Well... Welcome home.

425
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:47,260
Daniel... No more flash?

426
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:51,845
No.

427
00:24:52,945 --> 00:24:54,515
No more flash.

428
00:24:55,315 --> 00:24:57,630
The record is spinning again.

429
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,530
We're just not on the song
we wanna be on.

430
00:25:07,130 --> 00:25:09,830
- Where's dad?
- Come on, Luv.

431
00:25:22,730 --> 00:25:24,145
Charlotte.

432
00:25:25,145 --> 00:25:27,080
Hello.

433
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:30,515
Somebody will be along shortly
to show you to your rooms.

434
00:25:31,015 --> 00:25:32,315
In the meantime,

435
00:25:32,415 --> 00:25:35,460
Mr. LaFleur here can
fill you in on the situation.

436
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:40,815
"Mr. LaFleur"?

437
00:25:40,915 --> 00:25:43,180
It's creole. I improvised.

438
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:44,915
What happened in there?

439
00:25:45,015 --> 00:25:47,680
Well, he believed my story.
But we're getting punted.

440
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:50,045
The bastard's putting us on their sub tomorrow

441
00:25:50,145 --> 00:25:51,371
and shipping us off to Tahiti.

442
00:25:51,521 --> 00:25:52,830
How's that bad news?

443
00:25:52,933 --> 00:25:55,033

444
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:57,980
You guys, come on! Now!

445
00:25:58,080 --> 00:25:59,745
Let's go! Get in!
Get in! Move!

446
00:25:59,945 --> 00:26:02,780
Let's go! Get out of here!
Come on! Come on!

447
00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:07,260
Come on! Inside! Move! Now!

448
00:26:16,130 --> 00:26:18,500
Heather, keep an eye on them.

449
00:26:59,352 --> 00:27:00,652
Uh-oh.

450
00:27:26,830 --> 00:27:28,645
Hello, Mr. Alpert.

451
00:27:30,045 --> 00:27:31,180
Hello, Mr. Goodspeed.

452
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:32,980
I wish you would've told me
you were coming.

453
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:34,815
I would've turned the fence off for you.

454
00:27:34,915 --> 00:27:37,745
That fence may keep other things out,
but not us.

455
00:27:38,645 --> 00:27:41,115
Now, the only thing that
does keep us out, Horace,

456
00:27:41,715 --> 00:27:43,145
Is our truce...

457
00:27:44,045 --> 00:27:45,545
which yove now broken.

458
00:27:46,345 --> 00:27:48,515
I don't know what you're talking about.

459
00:27:49,115 --> 00:27:51,160
Where are my two men?

460
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:56,915
You know what?

461
00:27:57,015 --> 00:27:59,245
Getting on that sub is starting
to sound like a great idea.

462
00:28:00,145 --> 00:28:01,637
What do you say? Sub anyone?

463
00:28:01,787 --> 00:28:04,580
Hold your horses, bonsai.
No one's getting on a sub.

464
00:28:06,180 --> 00:28:09,615
Okay, LaFleur, how well did you
bury those bodies?

465
00:28:10,115 --> 00:28:12,215
Well, that depends on how hard he looks.

466
00:28:12,915 --> 00:28:15,780
Call the arrow. Tell them we're at condition one.

467
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:19,395
Take the heavy ordnance,
and make sure the fence is at maximum.

468
00:28:19,445 --> 00:28:20,380
Yes, sir.

469
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:23,015
- Let me talk to him. - Excuse me?

470
00:28:23,215 --> 00:28:25,245
Your buddy out there with the eyeliner,
Let me talk to him.

471
00:28:25,345 --> 00:28:28,095
 We had a truce with these people.
You don't understand.

472
00:28:28,145 --> 00:28:30,415
I understand I'm the one that
killed his men, and I'm the one

473
00:28:30,515 --> 00:28:32,150
that's gonna go out there
and tell him why I did it.

474
00:28:32,300 --> 00:28:33,580
I can't let you do that.

475
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:36,415
Well, it's a good thing I ain't
asking your permission.

476
00:28:37,215 --> 00:28:40,045
James, are you sure you know
what you're doing?

477
00:28:41,345 --> 00:28:43,930
Not yet. But I'll figure something out.

478
00:28:52,730 --> 00:28:54,060
Hello, Richard.

479
00:28:56,860 --> 00:28:59,115
I'm sorry. Do we know each other?

480
00:28:59,715 --> 00:29:01,860
I'm the guy that killed your men.

481
00:29:04,930 --> 00:29:06,515
Heard some gunshots,

482
00:29:06,615 --> 00:29:09,545
saw two men throwing a bag
over a woman's head.

483
00:29:10,545 --> 00:29:13,045
Gave them a chance to throw
the weapons down and walk away,

484
00:29:13,145 --> 00:29:16,015
but one of them took a shot at me,
and I defended myself.

485
00:29:16,415 --> 00:29:17,945
Is that so?

486
00:29:18,045 --> 00:29:19,780
That's so.

487
00:29:20,180 --> 00:29:22,580
Your people know that you're telling me this?

488
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:24,431
They ain't my people, Hoss.

489
00:29:24,481 --> 00:29:26,915
So if you got some
kind of a truce with them,

490
00:29:27,015 --> 00:29:28,645
it ain't been broken.

491
00:29:29,645 --> 00:29:31,645
If you're not a member
of the Dharma Initiative,

492
00:29:31,745 --> 00:29:33,400
then what are you?

493
00:29:40,860 --> 00:29:42,600
Did you bury the bomb?

494
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:44,015
Excuse me?

495
00:29:44,115 --> 00:29:46,315
The hydrogen bomb with
"Jughead" written on the side.

496
00:29:46,615 --> 00:29:48,280
Did you bury it?

497
00:29:48,980 --> 00:29:50,845
Yeah, I know about it.

498
00:29:50,945 --> 00:29:52,980
I also know that 20 years ago,

499
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:54,960
some bald fella limped into your camp

500
00:29:55,060 --> 00:29:57,845
and fed you some mumbo jumbo
about being your leader.

501
00:29:58,145 --> 00:29:59,715
and then poof...

502
00:30:00,315 --> 00:30:02,115
He went and disappeared right in front of ya.

503
00:30:02,215 --> 00:30:04,200
Any of this ringin' a bell?

504
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:08,815
That man's name is John Locke,

505
00:30:09,215 --> 00:30:11,280
and I'm waitin' for him to come back.

506
00:30:12,780 --> 00:30:13,780
So...

507
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:17,180
you still think I'm a member
of the damn Dharma Initiative?

508
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:19,215
No.

509
00:30:20,615 --> 00:30:22,260
I guess I don't.

510
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:27,315
But no matter who you are,

511
00:30:27,415 --> 00:30:29,845
two of my men are dead,

512
00:30:29,945 --> 00:30:32,880
and my people need
some kind of justice.

513
00:30:34,180 --> 00:30:36,060
What are we gonna do about that?

514
00:30:40,913 --> 00:30:43,413

515
00:30:50,930 --> 00:30:52,560
How are you doing, Amy?

516
00:30:55,900 --> 00:30:57,380
Is he gone?

517
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:58,945
Alpert?

518
00:30:59,045 --> 00:31:00,647
No, he's not gone.

519
00:31:01,598 --> 00:31:03,280
We told him where the bodies were.

520
00:31:03,380 --> 00:31:04,945
You told him? Why?

521
00:31:05,045 --> 00:31:06,645
We had to.

522
00:31:06,745 --> 00:31:09,045
It was the only way
to maintain the truce.

523
00:31:10,145 --> 00:31:12,215
Jim here worked it out with him, but...

524
00:31:12,315 --> 00:31:15,100
Well, he's gonna need something from us now.

525
00:31:17,060 --> 00:31:20,400
He needs to take Paul's body back with him.

526
00:31:24,260 --> 00:31:26,415
- Hey.
- Oh...No.

527
00:31:26,515 --> 00:31:28,780
Hey, Ames.

528
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:30,515
Listen,

529
00:31:30,615 --> 00:31:32,715
we've been friends
for a long time, yeah?

530
00:31:33,115 --> 00:31:36,715
So... this is completely your choice.

531
00:31:37,015 --> 00:31:39,515
If you don't want to give him to them,

532
00:31:39,815 --> 00:31:42,830
then we will suffer the consequences.

533
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:56,200
They can take him.

534
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:00,800
He would want to keep us safe.

535
00:32:03,829 --> 00:32:05,729

536
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,900
Can I have a minute, please?

537
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:10,840

538
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:37,700
I'm sorry.

539
00:32:47,730 --> 00:32:49,080
You need some help?

540
00:32:49,180 --> 00:32:52,330
Hmm? Oh.
Nah, I've got it. Thanks.

541
00:32:54,900 --> 00:32:58,345
Hey, Jim, the sub leaving tomorrow morning...

542
00:32:58,445 --> 00:33:00,415
It returns in two weeks.

543
00:33:00,915 --> 00:33:02,315
Until then,

544
00:33:02,415 --> 00:33:05,600
you can stay and look
for the rest of your crew.

545
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:08,730
Thanks.

546
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,715
I bought us two weeks.

547
00:33:22,715 --> 00:33:25,645
Horace said we can
wait for the next sub.

548
00:33:25,745 --> 00:33:28,480
With any luck,
Locke'll be back by then.

549
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:30,380
And then what?

550
00:33:31,980 --> 00:33:34,280
What do you mean, "then what"?

551
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:38,045
Locke said he was leaving to save us.

552
00:33:38,945 --> 00:33:40,845
The flashes have stopped.

553
00:33:40,945 --> 00:33:42,610
They're over.

554
00:33:43,210 --> 00:33:45,180
No more bloody noses.

555
00:33:45,780 --> 00:33:47,515
We're already saved.

556
00:33:47,615 --> 00:33:49,545
That sub behind you brought me here.

557
00:33:49,845 --> 00:33:52,830
I've been trying to get off of
this island for more than three years,

558
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:54,830
and now I've got my chance.

559
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:58,330
I'm going to leave.

560
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:07,645
You do realize it's 1974,

561
00:34:08,245 --> 00:34:10,830
that whatever it is you think
you're going back to...

562
00:34:10,930 --> 00:34:12,845
It don't exist yet.

563
00:34:14,845 --> 00:34:16,760
It's not a reason not to go.

564
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:21,200
Hell, what about me?

565
00:34:22,660 --> 00:34:24,780
You really gonna leave me here
with the mad scientist

566
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:26,780
and Mr."I speak to dead people"?

567
00:34:27,680 --> 00:34:29,615
And Jin, who's a hell of a nice guy

568
00:34:29,715 --> 00:34:32,115
but not exactly the
greatest conversationalist.

569
00:34:32,215 --> 00:34:33,815
You'll be fine.

570
00:34:33,915 --> 00:34:35,315
Maybe...

571
00:34:35,415 --> 00:34:37,460
But who's gonna get my back?

572
00:34:44,930 --> 00:34:46,715
Come on.

573
00:34:47,415 --> 00:34:50,015
Just give me two weeks,
that's all I'm asking.

574
00:34:50,815 --> 00:34:52,400
Two weeks.

575
00:35:03,430 --> 00:35:05,100
All right. Two weeks.

576
00:35:13,813 --> 00:35:16,613

577
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:54,680
Mmm, somethin' smells good.

578
00:35:54,780 --> 00:35:56,500
Hey there.

579
00:36:13,830 --> 00:36:15,430
Is that for me?

580
00:36:18,430 --> 00:36:20,360
You were amazing today.

581
00:36:24,015 --> 00:36:25,516

582
00:36:27,016 --> 00:36:29,245
Thank you for believing in me.

583
00:36:29,345 --> 00:36:30,800
Ah.

584
00:36:37,030 --> 00:36:38,300
Mmm.

585
00:36:42,660 --> 00:36:44,415
I love you.

586
00:36:44,915 --> 00:36:45,880
Mmm.

587
00:36:45,980 --> 00:36:47,680
I love you, too.

588
00:36:48,980 --> 00:36:51,980
Mmm.

589
00:36:54,905 --> 00:36:58,005

590
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:03,815
Wake up, boss.

591
00:37:03,915 --> 00:37:05,545
Ah.

592
00:37:06,645 --> 00:37:07,645
Oh!

593
00:37:07,745 --> 00:37:09,545
How's your head?

594
00:37:09,645 --> 00:37:11,100
It hurts.

595
00:37:13,660 --> 00:37:15,515
I got good news and bad news.

596
00:37:16,515 --> 00:37:18,200
What you want first?

597
00:37:19,930 --> 00:37:21,115
Good news.

598
00:37:21,215 --> 00:37:22,900
You're a daddy.

599
00:37:25,900 --> 00:37:27,980
Bad news is you missed it.

600
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:30,280
Oh, gosh.

601
00:37:31,380 --> 00:37:34,145
Amy... She had the baby?

602
00:37:34,945 --> 00:37:36,715
It's a boy.

603
00:37:37,415 --> 00:37:39,080
A boy?

604
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:43,500
Oh...

605
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:47,580
Now how about you tell me...

606
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:50,715
why you're too busy drinking
and blowing up trees

607
00:37:50,815 --> 00:37:52,715
to see him be born?

608
00:37:53,315 --> 00:37:55,130
I was, uh...

609
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:00,830
I was looking for a pair of socks,

610
00:38:00,930 --> 00:38:03,145
and all of mine were dirty,

611
00:38:03,245 --> 00:38:06,060
so I went to grab a pair of Amy's, and...

612
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:10,280
I found this...

613
00:38:10,380 --> 00:38:12,480
in the back of her drawer.

614
00:38:12,580 --> 00:38:14,545
It was Paul's.

615
00:38:15,045 --> 00:38:17,245
You got in a fight over a necklace?

616
00:38:17,345 --> 00:38:18,845
I know.

617
00:38:19,545 --> 00:38:20,688

618
00:38:20,739 --> 00:38:21,715
But...

619
00:38:21,815 --> 00:38:24,480
It's only been three years, Jim.

620
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:27,515
Just three years that he's been gone.

621
00:38:28,515 --> 00:38:31,900
Is that really long enough
to get over someone?

622
00:38:39,700 --> 00:38:41,900
I had a thing for a girl once.

623
00:38:44,630 --> 00:38:46,945
And I had a shot at her,

624
00:38:47,445 --> 00:38:49,430
but I didn't take it.

625
00:38:51,430 --> 00:38:53,445
For a little while,
I'd lay in bed every night,

626
00:38:53,545 --> 00:38:56,060
wondering if it was a mistake.

627
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:01,215
Wondering if...

628
00:39:01,315 --> 00:39:03,800
I'd ever stop thinking about her.

629
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:11,500
And now I can barely remember
what she looks like.

630
00:39:13,260 --> 00:39:16,045
I mean, her face... it's...

631
00:39:16,445 --> 00:39:18,815
She's just gone,

632
00:39:18,915 --> 00:39:21,315
and she ain't never coming back.

633
00:39:23,615 --> 00:39:24,980
So...

634
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:29,130
Is three years long enough
to get over someone?

635
00:39:31,860 --> 00:39:33,560
Absolutely.

636
00:39:50,248 --> 00:39:51,548

637
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:54,160
Oh.

638
00:40:04,630 --> 00:40:06,100
What?

639
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:10,080
Wait. What?

640
00:40:10,380 --> 00:40:11,980
H... no. No.

641
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:13,580
Don't bring them in.

642
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:15,600
Just meet me in the North Valley.

643
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:18,600
Who was it?

644
00:40:24,230 --> 00:40:26,680
James, what's going on?

645
00:40:26,780 --> 00:40:27,780
It was Jin.

646
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:28,945
Is everything okay?

647
00:40:29,045 --> 00:40:30,625
Yeah. I just...

648
00:40:31,675 --> 00:40:33,560
I gotta go.
