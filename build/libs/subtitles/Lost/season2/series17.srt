1
00:00:00,474 --> 00:00:01,944
Previously on Lost...

2
00:00:02,038 --> 00:00:05,037
I met my real father.
Great news, right?

3
00:00:05,083 --> 00:00:08,083
He pretended to love me just
long enough to steal my kidney.

4
00:00:08,128 --> 00:00:11,079
I followed you last night.
Is it your father's house?

5
00:00:11,267 --> 00:00:14,967
But you have to promise me that you're
not gonna go to that place anymore.

6
00:00:15,029 --> 00:00:15,689
All right.

7
00:00:17,325 --> 00:00:20,496
You think you're the first
person that ever got conned?

8
00:00:20,572 --> 00:00:23,954
You needed a father figure,
and I needed a kidney.

9
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:27,420
- Hey, Helen--
- You're gonna have to choose.

10
00:00:27,589 --> 00:00:29,395
Him or me.

11
00:00:33,281 --> 00:00:35,896
My name is Henry Gale.
I'm from Minnesota.

12
00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:39,377
You draw up a map to your balloon,
we go out there, we find it.

13
00:00:39,410 --> 00:00:40,907
And if I mess up,
they'll crucify me.

14
00:00:40,935 --> 00:00:43,170
Do you or do you not
know where it is?

15
00:00:43,263 --> 00:00:45,546
I went back there
to bury my wife.

16
00:00:45,639 --> 00:00:48,734
- It's to his balloon.
- This is at least a day's walk.

17
00:00:48,837 --> 00:00:50,204
Then we should get going.

18
00:00:50,297 --> 00:00:51,876
This is where he
said it would be.

19
00:00:51,906 --> 00:00:53,214
We need to be sure.

20
00:00:53,308 --> 00:00:57,455
If I was one of them, these people that
you seem to think are your enemies,

21
00:00:57,547 --> 00:00:58,647
there'd be no balloon,

22
00:00:59,102 --> 00:01:02,485
so I'd draw a map to
a real secluded place.

23
00:01:03,092 --> 00:01:07,042
And when your friends got there, a bunch
of my people would be waiting for 'em.

24
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:12,059
I guess it's a good thing
I'm not one of them, huh?

25
00:01:36,998 --> 00:01:40,047
So, what did I do
to deserve this?

26
00:01:40,185 --> 00:01:40,892
What?

27
00:01:41,498 --> 00:01:45,597
Can't a fella take his girl out
for a picnic lunch just 'cause?

28
00:01:45,739 --> 00:01:50,506
- "Fella"?
- That's right. Fella.

29
00:01:52,704 --> 00:01:54,414
So, where you taking me?

30
00:01:54,599 --> 00:01:58,317
I'm not tellin',
so just quit askin'.

31
00:01:59,018 --> 00:02:00,632
Can I be of any help?

32
00:02:01,474 --> 00:02:05,622
You just read your obituaries
and drink your coffee, and

33
00:02:06,089 --> 00:02:08,277
I'll take care of
the everything.

34
00:02:08,509 --> 00:02:12,465
Don't knock the obits.
It's the nicest part of the paper.

35
00:02:12,604 --> 00:02:15,988
No one ever says anything mean
about people once they're dead.

36
00:02:16,084 --> 00:02:20,610
Mm. Now here I am, thinking the funnies
are the nicest part of the paper.

37
00:02:24,259 --> 00:02:25,348
John?

38
00:02:28,015 --> 00:02:30,394
John, what's your
father's name?

39
00:02:32,309 --> 00:02:33,208
Why?

40
00:02:34,096 --> 00:02:37,956
Is it Anthony? Anthony Cooper.

41
00:02:40,109 --> 00:02:41,819
Yes, that's right.

42
00:02:44,954 --> 00:02:46,948
He's dead.

43
00:02:57,663 --> 00:02:59,804
Draw it again.
The map to your balloon.

44
00:02:59,944 --> 00:03:02,132
I was joking.
I was making a joke.

45
00:03:07,091 --> 00:03:10,331
There's nothing out
there besides my balloon.

46
00:03:11,078 --> 00:03:13,028
I was just frustrated.

47
00:03:13,214 --> 00:03:16,071
It was a stupid thing to say.
I'm sorry.

48
00:03:16,443 --> 00:03:19,445
It's too late, anyway.
She's already long gone, Jack.

49
00:03:20,846 --> 00:03:23,655
So, what's done is done.

50
00:03:23,776 --> 00:03:25,057
That's right.

51
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:31,502
Put him back in the armory.

52
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:46,514
Why do you let him
talk to you like that?

53
00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:58,487
- Hey, wait. I--
- Shut up.

54
00:03:59,656 --> 00:04:00,505
John?

55
00:04:01,253 --> 00:04:01,940
I'm sorry.

56
00:04:03,343 --> 00:04:04,718
John!

57
00:04:13,045 --> 00:04:14,518
Maybe he's wrong.

58
00:04:14,608 --> 00:04:16,578
We should search the
other side of the cliff.

59
00:04:16,608 --> 00:04:20,030
We've been searching for three hours.
This balloon does not exist.

60
00:04:20,222 --> 00:04:21,113
Charlie!

61
00:04:21,347 --> 00:04:23,155
Then why'd he draw the map?

62
00:04:23,487 --> 00:04:26,616
You told him you would protect him
whether we found this balloon or not.

63
00:04:26,646 --> 00:04:30,123
You've given him two more days to stall,
to figure out how to escape.

64
00:04:31,948 --> 00:04:33,323
We're done.

65
00:04:33,743 --> 00:04:34,974
Charlie!

66
00:04:35,075 --> 00:04:37,309
Over here!This way!

67
00:04:39,782 --> 00:04:40,869
Sayid!

68
00:04:48,168 --> 00:04:52,123
He said he buried her, right?
His wife?

69
00:05:01,010 --> 00:05:03,102
Why isn't it raining here?

70
00:05:32,668 --> 00:05:36,147
Hurley. You seen Ana Lucia?

71
00:05:36,193 --> 00:05:39,157
She took off into the jungle with
Charlie and Sayid yesterday.

72
00:05:39,187 --> 00:05:40,180
Yesterday.

73
00:05:42,572 --> 00:05:44,776
They say anything about
where they were going?

74
00:05:44,806 --> 00:05:48,306
Well, that would, like, assume that
anyone actually tells me anything.

75
00:05:49,347 --> 00:05:52,106
Maybe, if I were in the loop,
I could be more helpful.

76
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:54,094
There is no loop, Hurley.

77
00:05:55,168 --> 00:05:58,693
Excuse me, Jack,
he's been really hot and fussy.

78
00:05:58,879 --> 00:06:01,551
- Do you mind having a look?
- Yeah, sure. Sure.

79
00:06:07,167 --> 00:06:09,727
Loop, dude. Loop.

80
00:06:10,128 --> 00:06:12,125
So, the fever's
completely gone?

81
00:06:12,357 --> 00:06:13,111
Completely.

82
00:06:13,675 --> 00:06:16,004
You're not just
saying that, right?

83
00:06:16,225 --> 00:06:19,177
- You seem a bit distracted.
- No, I'm fine.

84
00:06:19,224 --> 00:06:22,749
- And so's Aaron.
- Thanks.

85
00:06:24,011 --> 00:06:25,720
Doctor still in?

86
00:06:27,075 --> 00:06:30,314
I was grabbing for
mussels in the tide pool,

87
00:06:30,414 --> 00:06:31,814
and pissed off a sea urchin.

88
00:06:31,875 --> 00:06:33,538
Well, it doesn't look infected.

89
00:06:33,771 --> 00:06:37,582
- A little neosporin wouldn't hurt.
- Yeah, right. Neosporin.

90
00:06:37,908 --> 00:06:40,955
I think the current
rate of exchange is

91
00:06:41,329 --> 00:06:43,946
ten loads of
laundry for a tube.

92
00:06:44,085 --> 00:06:44,887
Right.

93
00:08:17,024 --> 00:08:18,496
What was that?

94
00:08:24,248 --> 00:08:25,384
J ohn?

95
00:08:26,179 --> 00:08:27,463
What's the matter?

96
00:08:46,966 --> 00:08:49,203
You sure you want to do this?

97
00:08:53,833 --> 00:08:57,645
We could just go on that picnic,
you know.

98
00:08:57,784 --> 00:08:58,403
Hmm.

99
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:01,794
Soon, I promise.

100
00:09:05,957 --> 00:09:07,142
Hey...

101
00:09:08,371 --> 00:09:10,545
maybe he left you his kidney.

102
00:09:16,113 --> 00:09:19,877
For we who are alive,
who are left,

103
00:09:20,155 --> 00:09:24,105
will be caught up together with them in
the clouds to meet the Lord in the air,

104
00:09:24,489 --> 00:09:27,764
and so we will live
with the Lord forever.

105
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:34,073
We commit the soul of
Anthony Cooper to you,

106
00:09:34,158 --> 00:09:36,490
but we shall never
be separated.

107
00:09:39,904 --> 00:09:44,958
And now, we are united with Christ
as we go towards him. Amen.

108
00:09:48,335 --> 00:09:50,991
Do you wish to say
anything, John?

109
00:10:02,638 --> 00:10:04,329
I forgive you.

110
00:10:22,557 --> 00:10:23,408
John?

111
00:10:25,989 --> 00:10:27,306
Hey, you out there?

112
00:10:30,622 --> 00:10:32,715
What's that noise? John?

113
00:10:33,043 --> 00:10:34,513
What's going on? Talk to me.

114
00:10:34,633 --> 00:10:35,971
Will you be quiet?

115
00:10:36,193 --> 00:10:37,774
Tell me what's happening.
What the hell is--

116
00:10:37,804 --> 00:10:39,160
Will  you shut up?!

117
00:10:40,095 --> 00:10:43,573
11... 10... 9... 8...

118
00:10:43,947 --> 00:10:44,747
7...

119
00:10:45,311 --> 00:10:48,167
6... 5...

120
00:10:48,258 --> 00:10:49,971
Maybe you should get Jack.

121
00:10:50,061 --> 00:10:52,104
3... 2...

122
00:10:52,225 --> 00:10:53,696
- I said shut up!
- 1.

123
00:11:18,023 --> 00:11:19,111
What happened?

124
00:11:23,755 --> 00:11:25,403
I bet four papayas.

125
00:11:25,512 --> 00:11:27,591
You can't bet. I just bet.

126
00:11:28,103 --> 00:11:32,444
You can either call or raise,
or lay 'em down, mutton chops.

127
00:11:36,325 --> 00:11:37,697
Don't look at me.

128
00:11:38,118 --> 00:11:40,796
Lay 'em down, Hurley.
He's got you beat.

129
00:11:40,893 --> 00:11:44,563
- Dude, I got a killer hand here.
- No, you don't.

130
00:11:44,637 --> 00:11:47,553
- But you don't even know what I--
- You got a baby straight.

131
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:49,341
He's got the flush.

132
00:11:53,081 --> 00:11:55,222
What about me? What do I got?

133
00:11:56,264 --> 00:12:00,206
Hard to say, but you're just
playing for the fun of it.

134
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:03,630
Well, fun's not bad.
You should try it sometime.

135
00:12:05,921 --> 00:12:07,683
Don't call him, Hurley.

136
00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:10,288
Hey, Amarillo Slim,

137
00:12:12,151 --> 00:12:16,059
think 'cause you watch poker on tv,
you can tussle with the big boys?

138
00:12:16,666 --> 00:12:18,216
I gotta head back to the hatch.

139
00:12:18,511 --> 00:12:20,602
Hatch ain't goin' nowhere, doc.

140
00:12:21,865 --> 00:12:25,740
How 'bout you put your
mangoes where your mouth is?

141
00:12:31,852 --> 00:12:34,422
Guess I could play
a hand or two.

142
00:12:43,593 --> 00:12:44,489
Hey!

143
00:12:45,377 --> 00:12:47,040
What's going on?

144
00:12:53,401 --> 00:12:56,886
Are you still out there?
John. John?

145
00:12:57,270 --> 00:12:58,627
I'm here.

146
00:12:58,950 --> 00:13:01,407
What were those noises?
What's wrong? Did something--

147
00:13:01,436 --> 00:13:03,137
Nothing is wrong.

148
00:13:19,892 --> 00:13:21,835
So, what's the verdict,
Mr. Locke?

149
00:13:21,929 --> 00:13:25,406
Uh, the seismic bolting
is all first rate.

150
00:13:25,507 --> 00:13:29,503
There's no visible mold.
No dry rot.

151
00:13:30,531 --> 00:13:32,639
It'll all be in my report,
but, uh,

152
00:13:32,780 --> 00:13:35,680
I think you and your husband
got a pretty nice house here.

153
00:13:36,057 --> 00:13:40,376
If I had a husband,
I'm sure he would be happy to hear that.

154
00:13:42,246 --> 00:13:44,932
If you'll just sign
this invoice...

155
00:14:16,822 --> 00:14:18,531
Hello, son.

156
00:14:26,546 --> 00:14:27,955
What do you want?

157
00:14:29,469 --> 00:14:30,845
Look, John,

158
00:14:31,769 --> 00:14:34,140
I know what I did
to you was wrong.

159
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:36,086
You stole my kidney.

160
00:14:37,911 --> 00:14:39,811
I was dying.

161
00:14:40,325 --> 00:14:44,377
You could've asked me.
You could've just asked me.

162
00:14:52,237 --> 00:14:54,281
What do you want from me?

163
00:14:55,309 --> 00:14:57,594
I killed myself off because

164
00:14:57,732 --> 00:15:00,883
there are two men out there
who were gonna beat me to it.

165
00:15:01,165 --> 00:15:03,926
Oh. What did you do,
steal their livers?

166
00:15:04,009 --> 00:15:07,508
No. I took them for $700,000.

167
00:15:08,048 --> 00:15:09,486
Retirement con.

168
00:15:11,494 --> 00:15:14,149
I put the money in
a safe deposit box,

169
00:15:14,776 --> 00:15:19,019
but these two guys may be sitting on
the bank to see if I show my face,

170
00:15:19,139 --> 00:15:24,577
which is why I need you to go
in there and get it for me.

171
00:15:31,834 --> 00:15:33,682
You think I'm stupid?

172
00:15:33,827 --> 00:15:37,446
I want you to take
200 grand of it.

173
00:15:39,453 --> 00:15:42,034
It won't make up for
what I did to you,

174
00:15:42,256 --> 00:15:44,417
but it's the best I can do.

175
00:15:46,641 --> 00:15:48,783
I'll be at the
Flight Line motel--

176
00:15:48,876 --> 00:15:51,526
it's out near the airport--
until tomorrow afternoon,

177
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:54,395
and then I'm gone,
money or no money.

178
00:15:54,767 --> 00:15:58,294
And, John,
if I don't see you again...

179
00:16:00,228 --> 00:16:01,731
I'll understand.

180
00:16:13,344 --> 00:16:14,900
We're locked in.

181
00:16:20,289 --> 00:16:21,334
What?

182
00:16:22,022 --> 00:16:25,213
These glass doors came down.

183
00:16:25,355 --> 00:16:28,067
The whole living area's sealed off.
I can't get out.

184
00:16:29,818 --> 00:16:32,702
- Did you try to pry--
- Yeah, but I couldn't...

185
00:16:36,790 --> 00:16:37,861
Maybe...

186
00:16:40,405 --> 00:16:41,655
maybe if the two of us...

187
00:16:41,713 --> 00:16:48,038
- You want me to help you?
- Yeah.

188
00:16:50,144 --> 00:16:54,863
And if I do help you
get these doors up,

189
00:16:55,494 --> 00:16:58,471
then you're just gonna lock
me back in here, aren't you?

190
00:17:02,306 --> 00:17:04,088
That's right.

191
00:17:08,754 --> 00:17:11,123
Then I'm gonna need
your word, John.

192
00:17:12,954 --> 00:17:15,402
I'm gonna need your word
that you won't let your

193
00:17:15,682 --> 00:17:18,268
people  do anything to me.

194
00:17:18,442 --> 00:17:21,628
Well, if you're who you say you are,
then what are you worried about?

195
00:17:21,658 --> 00:17:23,269
Things have happened to them,

196
00:17:23,468 --> 00:17:25,739
things that I have
nothing to do with.

197
00:17:25,886 --> 00:17:30,361
But they've got no one to blame,
except for me.

198
00:17:31,108 --> 00:17:33,273
So I'm gonna need your word

199
00:17:33,874 --> 00:17:36,236
that you'll protect me,

200
00:17:36,516 --> 00:17:38,895
no matter what.

201
00:17:57,203 --> 00:17:58,278
Who are you?

202
00:18:02,863 --> 00:18:07,057
My name is Henry Gale.
I'm from Minnesota...

203
00:18:08,365 --> 00:18:12,179
and I crashed on this
island just like you.

204
00:18:16,576 --> 00:18:17,624
All right.

205
00:18:18,603 --> 00:18:19,928
You have my word.

206
00:18:27,086 --> 00:18:29,825
- Dude, you got me.
- I'm out.

207
00:18:31,436 --> 00:18:33,815
Think  you're in my head, doc?

208
00:18:33,918 --> 00:18:37,531
Still got three papayas.
Call or fold.

209
00:18:38,793 --> 00:18:41,234
Well, you're in trouble now,
cool hand.

210
00:18:41,464 --> 00:18:43,699
Pocket queens makes me a set.

211
00:18:50,722 --> 00:18:52,655
Kings wired.

212
00:18:53,123 --> 00:18:55,023
Whoa, dude.

213
00:18:56,629 --> 00:18:59,338
But at least I'm
not in your head.

214
00:19:01,298 --> 00:19:04,111
- Well, I guess that's it.
- What do you mean, it?

215
00:19:04,896 --> 00:19:07,610
Sawyer, you're busted.
I got it all.

216
00:19:08,795 --> 00:19:11,509
Wouldn't really be fair for you
to go out and pick more mangoes.

217
00:19:11,539 --> 00:19:14,014
Oh, I got a hell of
a lot more mangoes.

218
00:19:14,167 --> 00:19:16,197
You wanna play real stakes?
Name 'em.

219
00:19:17,111 --> 00:19:20,867
- It's a pile of fruit, man.
- And I want it back.

220
00:19:21,132 --> 00:19:23,273
Should I go and get a ruler?

221
00:19:25,377 --> 00:19:28,116
Fun time's over, Mongo.
Why don't you hit the buffet?

222
00:19:28,196 --> 00:19:30,241
- But I wanna--
- Come on, Hurley.

223
00:19:30,373 --> 00:19:33,422
Let's go leave these
boys to their sandbox.

224
00:19:36,517 --> 00:19:41,055
One more hand, doc.
What's it gonna take?

225
00:19:42,062 --> 00:19:47,165
The medicine you stole from the armory.
All of it.

226
00:19:58,927 --> 00:20:00,017
Okay.

227
00:20:00,887 --> 00:20:02,979
Ready? One. Two. Three.

228
00:20:12,571 --> 00:20:13,330
Let's go.

229
00:20:16,838 --> 00:20:17,783
Harder.

230
00:20:25,597 --> 00:20:26,403
I'm losing it.

231
00:20:27,336 --> 00:20:29,873
The toolbox. Get the toolbox.
I'll hold it.

232
00:20:30,044 --> 00:20:31,831
- You sure?
- Get it!

233
00:20:33,786 --> 00:20:35,621
Come on! Come on! Put it under.

234
00:20:58,130 --> 00:21:00,046
John, wait. Don't you think--

235
00:21:05,972 --> 00:21:07,507
You have to stop the door.

236
00:21:07,630 --> 00:21:09,511
Put something else
under the door.

237
00:21:10,156 --> 00:21:11,440
Come on! Come on!

238
00:21:15,676 --> 00:21:18,485
Stack them, stack them.
You have to stop the pressure.

239
00:21:19,981 --> 00:21:21,788
Come on, come on, come on.

240
00:21:28,711 --> 00:21:29,761
All right, all right.

241
00:21:30,104 --> 00:21:32,404
Let's get you out.
Let's get you out. Come on.

242
00:21:32,709 --> 00:21:34,660
No, no, no, stop.
Stop, stop, stop.

243
00:21:36,577 --> 00:21:39,912
All right. We'll wait till
somebody comes. All right?

244
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:45,033
It's only a matter
of time. Yeah?

245
00:21:46,418 --> 00:21:48,224
No, we don't have time.

246
00:22:31,655 --> 00:22:32,675
Honey...

247
00:22:34,109 --> 00:22:36,966
put on your sunday best.

248
00:22:37,142 --> 00:22:39,666
I am taking you out to paint--

249
00:22:39,757 --> 00:22:42,760
John, we have visitors.

250
00:22:44,396 --> 00:22:47,828
Um, these men say they
knew your father.

251
00:22:48,949 --> 00:22:51,904
Hi, John. I'm Jimmy Bane.

252
00:22:55,099 --> 00:22:57,032
I'm sure Helen told you that
I didn't know him very well.

253
00:22:57,062 --> 00:22:58,072
She told me--

254
00:22:58,538 --> 00:23:01,828
But I'd like to ask you a couple
questions, if that's okay.

255
00:23:03,189 --> 00:23:05,319
Sure, of course.

256
00:23:05,660 --> 00:23:08,284
Have you seen your father since he died,
Mr. Locke?

257
00:23:09,821 --> 00:23:11,817
How-- have I--

258
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:15,056
Well, we were thinking,
possibly, he's not dead, and

259
00:23:15,129 --> 00:23:16,508
maybe you know that.

260
00:23:16,599 --> 00:23:18,596
I mean, for his son,

261
00:23:18,736 --> 00:23:21,211
you didn't look too
shook up at his funeral.

262
00:23:22,729 --> 00:23:24,085
How dare you?

263
00:23:24,225 --> 00:23:26,236
If you had any idea what
that man did to him,

264
00:23:26,266 --> 00:23:27,464
what that son of a bitch--

265
00:23:27,494 --> 00:23:28,823
Hey, Helen...

266
00:23:29,198 --> 00:23:31,524
We were there to get past him,

267
00:23:31,771 --> 00:23:34,935
to get on with our lives,
to let him go.

268
00:23:36,758 --> 00:23:38,404
- Get out of here.
- Helen--

269
00:23:38,494 --> 00:23:40,403
Okay. Okay.

270
00:23:40,566 --> 00:23:42,343
Just one thing before we go.

271
00:23:44,925 --> 00:23:47,344
What's in the bag, John?

272
00:23:50,804 --> 00:23:54,762
Work papers and stuff.
I'm a home inspector.

273
00:23:56,142 --> 00:23:58,163
Mind if we take a look?

274
00:24:20,554 --> 00:24:24,827
Well... there you go.

275
00:24:27,286 --> 00:24:29,179
Thanks for the coffee, miss.

276
00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:50,240
Helen, I'm sorry. Are you okay?

277
00:24:51,728 --> 00:24:54,325
Were you lying to
those men, John?

278
00:24:56,685 --> 00:24:59,734
No, I was scared. I was...

279
00:25:01,464 --> 00:25:02,791
I was scared.

280
00:25:18,481 --> 00:25:20,584
So, where'd you learn
to play cards, doc?

281
00:25:22,714 --> 00:25:23,899
Phuket.

282
00:25:24,739 --> 00:25:26,789
What the hell were
you doin' in Thailand?

283
00:25:29,750 --> 00:25:32,416
What, you don't think
I know where Phuket is?

284
00:25:32,835 --> 00:25:36,051
Just 'cause I dropped out of ninth
grade don't make me an idiot.

285
00:25:37,992 --> 00:25:39,404
Far East, huh?

286
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:41,844
Wouldn't have taken you
for a world traveler.

287
00:25:42,479 --> 00:25:45,086
That where you got the
art on your shoulder?

288
00:25:46,681 --> 00:25:49,019
How about you deal again?

289
00:25:49,598 --> 00:25:50,355
What?

290
00:25:51,195 --> 00:25:54,265
And this time,
from the top of the deck.

291
00:25:58,313 --> 00:26:00,119
Well, I had to try.

292
00:26:11,068 --> 00:26:14,586
- What does it do?
- We're not exactly sure.

293
00:26:14,888 --> 00:26:17,966
-  And you push it...
- Every 108 minutes, yeah.

294
00:26:18,535 --> 00:26:20,188
How soon does this
alarm go off?

295
00:26:20,342 --> 00:26:21,654
Very. Which is why

296
00:26:21,797 --> 00:26:24,824
I need you to go up through
the grate and into the vents.

297
00:26:24,914 --> 00:26:27,070
Grate's bolted shut. I tried.

298
00:26:27,231 --> 00:26:30,400
Yeah. There's another grate in the
pantry. You can get up through there.

299
00:26:30,430 --> 00:26:33,147
Take the vent into the dome.

300
00:26:33,658 --> 00:26:34,942
Maybe we should wait--

301
00:26:35,031 --> 00:26:37,431
Oh, we can't wait.
It's gonna go off any minute.

302
00:26:38,063 --> 00:26:42,851
I trusted you, Henry.
Now you've got to trust me.

303
00:26:42,935 --> 00:26:45,559
That button has to be pushed.

304
00:26:45,637 --> 00:26:48,091
Okay. What do I do?

305
00:26:48,596 --> 00:26:51,963
Once you're inside,
you'll hear the alarm beeping.

306
00:26:52,288 --> 00:26:54,624
Then you just have to
enter the numbers.

307
00:26:54,714 --> 00:27:00,335
4,  8, 15, 16, 23, 42.

308
00:27:00,493 --> 00:27:02,817
And then, you press "execute."

309
00:27:02,954 --> 00:27:05,938
It has to be exactly those
numbers in exactly that order.

310
00:27:06,246 --> 00:27:09,606
- Do you--
- 4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42.

311
00:27:10,278 --> 00:27:12,112
- I got it.
- Go.

312
00:27:16,717 --> 00:27:18,235
Can you reach it?

313
00:27:19,123 --> 00:27:20,356
I think so.

314
00:27:34,967 --> 00:27:36,237
Be careful.

315
00:27:41,008 --> 00:27:42,128
Henry!

316
00:27:51,506 --> 00:27:52,383
Henry!

317
00:27:58,690 --> 00:28:00,012
What's going on?

318
00:28:01,355 --> 00:28:04,186
Jack and Sawyer are finally
gonna beat each other up.

319
00:28:05,615 --> 00:28:06,916
Ten mangoes.

320
00:28:09,140 --> 00:28:13,019
Okay. I'll call you
with the aspirin,

321
00:28:13,095 --> 00:28:15,742
and raise you a bottle
of amoxicillin.

322
00:28:16,013 --> 00:28:18,902
Do you even know
what amoxicillin is?

323
00:28:19,881 --> 00:28:21,651
You may have been
to Phuket, doc,

324
00:28:21,687 --> 00:28:23,889
but I been to Tallahassee.

325
00:28:24,934 --> 00:28:28,981
Let's just say somethin' was burnin',
and it wasn't from the sunshine.

326
00:28:34,603 --> 00:28:36,170
I'm all in.

327
00:28:37,974 --> 00:28:41,185
Well, that's the move of a man
who wants me to lay it down.

328
00:28:41,525 --> 00:28:43,441
You're not gonna lay it down.

329
00:28:44,848 --> 00:28:47,203
I'm not, huh? Why is that?

330
00:28:47,538 --> 00:28:50,896
Because there's a bunch of
people watching us right now,

331
00:28:51,045 --> 00:28:53,216
and you don't want
them to see you lose.

332
00:28:53,777 --> 00:28:55,010
Again.

333
00:29:02,524 --> 00:29:06,291
Hmm. Well, all right. I call.

334
00:29:06,975 --> 00:29:08,370
What you got?

335
00:29:11,785 --> 00:29:15,892
A pair of nines?
You pushed in with a pair of nines?

336
00:29:15,979 --> 00:29:17,512
You caught me.

337
00:29:17,871 --> 00:29:19,704
Let's see 'em.

338
00:29:23,593 --> 00:29:25,667
Guess it was enough, huh?

339
00:29:25,756 --> 00:29:27,299
Son of a bitch.

340
00:29:28,762 --> 00:29:30,715
I'll come get the meds later.

341
00:29:32,645 --> 00:29:34,292
Hey.

342
00:29:35,556 --> 00:29:38,729
When I asked you what
you wanted for stakes,

343
00:29:38,808 --> 00:29:40,566
why didn't you
ask for the guns?

344
00:29:43,968 --> 00:29:47,926
When I need the guns,
I'll get the guns.

345
00:29:56,552 --> 00:29:57,205
Henry?

346
00:29:59,336 --> 00:30:00,915
Get up, damn it.

347
00:30:03,822 --> 00:30:05,019
Henry!

348
00:30:07,719 --> 00:30:10,116
Henry, are you all right?

349
00:30:10,188 --> 00:30:11,325
What happened?

350
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:13,435
Listen to me. You have to get

351
00:30:13,735 --> 00:30:16,635
up into the vents and enter
the numbers into the computer.

352
00:30:18,508 --> 00:30:19,513
How long was I--

353
00:30:19,673 --> 00:30:23,018
Please, you have to go right now.
We're running out of time.

354
00:30:24,288 --> 00:30:25,043
Yeah.

355
00:30:25,931 --> 00:30:27,287
Be careful!

356
00:30:43,801 --> 00:30:44,917
Henry?

357
00:30:49,511 --> 00:30:50,896
Henry, can you hear me?!

358
00:31:04,512 --> 00:31:05,920
Henry!

359
00:31:09,376 --> 00:31:09,820
Henry.

360
00:31:09,910 --> 00:31:10,446
Henry.

361
00:31:28,443 --> 00:31:29,929
Yeah, who is it?

362
00:31:31,118 --> 00:31:32,237
It's John.

363
00:31:40,270 --> 00:31:43,451
- Can I come in?
- Yeah, of course.

364
00:31:52,307 --> 00:31:54,304
- Any problems?
- No.

365
00:31:57,485 --> 00:32:00,970
Your date at my funeral--
she got a name?

366
00:32:02,323 --> 00:32:03,747
Helen.

367
00:32:05,008 --> 00:32:07,021
Well, that's a nice name.

368
00:32:07,286 --> 00:32:08,813
Pretty girl, too.

369
00:32:12,022 --> 00:32:15,671
I'm, uh,
I'm going to ask her to marry me...

370
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:19,264
tonight, actually.

371
00:32:19,423 --> 00:32:20,865
Well, good for you.

372
00:32:22,124 --> 00:32:24,276
Congratulations.

373
00:32:25,286 --> 00:32:26,842
Yeah, thanks.

374
00:32:29,839 --> 00:32:33,785
Your share.
Should buy you a nice honeymoon.

375
00:32:35,380 --> 00:32:37,528
I didn't do this for the money.

376
00:32:39,814 --> 00:32:42,210
Then why did you do it?

377
00:32:48,044 --> 00:32:50,797
Well... all right. Uh...

378
00:32:51,180 --> 00:32:53,780
My plane. I got a--
I got a cab waiting.

379
00:32:55,604 --> 00:32:57,356
If you don't want the cash,

380
00:32:58,533 --> 00:33:01,413
the maid's gonna
get a hell of a tip.

381
00:33:07,596 --> 00:33:09,217
Bye, John.

382
00:33:21,089 --> 00:33:22,781
Are you him?

383
00:33:23,078 --> 00:33:24,121
Listen, sweetheart--

384
00:33:26,225 --> 00:33:27,752
How could you?

385
00:33:28,399 --> 00:33:30,874
How could you do this to him?

386
00:33:32,652 --> 00:33:34,732
We were moving past this.

387
00:33:45,003 --> 00:33:46,240
Helen, wait.

388
00:33:48,293 --> 00:33:50,785
Helen, wait. You don't understand.
I was gonna tell you everything.

389
00:33:50,815 --> 00:33:53,065
- You lied to me.
- No, please, I can explain.

390
00:33:53,088 --> 00:33:55,963
You looked me right in the eye,
and you lied to me.

391
00:33:57,003 --> 00:33:58,382
You've made your choice, John.

392
00:33:58,412 --> 00:34:00,812
- No, no, no.
- You need his love more than mine.

393
00:34:00,818 --> 00:34:03,849
No, my choice is you.
I was gonna...

394
00:34:06,697 --> 00:34:07,851
I love you.

395
00:34:08,044 --> 00:34:10,078
No, please. Please.
Please, Helen.

396
00:34:10,546 --> 00:34:11,969
Please, I love you, and--

397
00:34:12,071 --> 00:34:14,310
and I want to spend my
life with you, and--

398
00:34:14,376 --> 00:34:17,815
and I can't live
without you, Helen.

399
00:34:18,020 --> 00:34:19,054
So...

400
00:34:24,442 --> 00:34:25,370
so...

401
00:34:27,071 --> 00:34:28,925
will you marry me?

402
00:34:51,885 --> 00:34:52,936
Helen.

403
00:35:24,165 --> 00:35:25,130
Henry!

404
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:31,518
Henry!

405
00:35:38,731 --> 00:35:39,764
Henry.

406
00:35:44,721 --> 00:35:45,617
Henry...

407
00:35:48,342 --> 00:35:49,741
Please say something.

408
00:36:36,318 --> 00:36:37,094
Aah!

409
00:36:44,702 --> 00:36:45,781
Henry!

410
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:53,904
Henry?

411
00:36:59,142 --> 00:37:00,711
Anybody here?

412
00:37:04,676 --> 00:37:05,947
Anybody here?

413
00:37:06,853 --> 00:37:07,938
Henry!

414
00:37:17,771 --> 00:37:19,199
You came back.

415
00:37:24,123 --> 00:37:27,177
What, did you think I was
going to leave you here?

416
00:37:28,341 --> 00:37:31,063
Come on. Can you stand?

417
00:37:31,570 --> 00:37:32,847
I don't...

418
00:37:35,235 --> 00:37:36,695
I think so.

419
00:37:51,584 --> 00:37:53,206
Thank you, Henry.

420
00:37:54,656 --> 00:37:56,922
Thank you for not leaving me.

421
00:37:58,499 --> 00:38:00,391
You're welcome, John.

422
00:38:06,889 --> 00:38:10,232
Hey. Hey, Jack. Wait up.

423
00:38:11,601 --> 00:38:14,391
- You heading back to the hatch?
- Yeah.

424
00:38:15,045 --> 00:38:16,452
Mind if I join?

425
00:38:16,655 --> 00:38:19,145
Been a while since I had a shower,
and I was just hoping that--

426
00:38:19,175 --> 00:38:21,367
Actually, the--
the plumbing's busted.

427
00:38:22,860 --> 00:38:23,759
Busted?

428
00:38:23,945 --> 00:38:25,241
Yeah, the water's
been running muddy.

429
00:38:25,271 --> 00:38:29,418
I guess we got a cracked pipe, but
it's gonna take some time to find it.

430
00:38:30,308 --> 00:38:34,508
Oh. Well,
I guess I wasted a trip, then.

431
00:38:35,476 --> 00:38:39,026
Well, I'll let you know as soon as
we get things worked out down there.

432
00:38:39,293 --> 00:38:40,219
Okay.

433
00:38:43,725 --> 00:38:46,144
I'm glad you beat Sawyer.

434
00:38:51,715 --> 00:38:52,746
You know what?

435
00:38:53,019 --> 00:38:57,892
The hatch can wait until morning if
you'd like me to walk you back to
the beach.

436
00:39:05,237 --> 00:39:08,074
- Do you see that?
- Yeah.

437
00:39:25,716 --> 00:39:27,219
A parachute.

438
00:39:34,376 --> 00:39:35,273
Wait.

439
00:39:41,217 --> 00:39:42,790
It's food.

440
00:39:54,465 --> 00:39:56,152
What the bloody hell is that?

441
00:40:01,999 --> 00:40:03,907
What'd you find?

442
00:40:07,013 --> 00:40:09,171
I got you. Easy, easy.

443
00:40:14,424 --> 00:40:15,447
Sorry.

444
00:40:23,166 --> 00:40:24,597
How did you do--

445
00:40:24,769 --> 00:40:29,621
What did you do to end it,
to make the doors go up?

446
00:40:30,199 --> 00:40:31,817
I did what you told me to.

447
00:40:32,420 --> 00:40:35,318
I punched in the code and
pressed the execute button, but

448
00:40:35,398 --> 00:40:38,672
nothing happened,
other than that clock flipping back.

449
00:40:38,759 --> 00:40:42,349
I was just climbing back into the
vent when the lights went out.

450
00:40:42,722 --> 00:40:45,841
Ten seconds later,
the doors went up.

451
00:40:46,132 --> 00:40:47,706
I didn't do anything.

452
00:40:48,190 --> 00:40:52,351
So you think it was
all just random?

453
00:40:53,158 --> 00:40:56,222
Don't look at me.
It's your hatch.

454
00:40:57,411 --> 00:41:01,105
- Get away from him.
- Wait. You don't--

455
00:41:01,191 --> 00:41:02,737
Step back right now.

456
00:41:02,838 --> 00:41:05,463
- Sayid, it's okay.
- I said get away!

457
00:41:05,566 --> 00:41:07,434
It's all right. I let him out.

458
00:41:07,708 --> 00:41:11,671
There was some kind of lockdown or
something. He-- he was helping me.

459
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:17,482
Couldn't you find my balloon?

460
00:41:17,650 --> 00:41:19,180
Yeah, we found it.

461
00:41:19,353 --> 00:41:21,509
We did find your balloon,
Henry Gale,

462
00:41:21,825 --> 00:41:24,194
exactly how you described it.

463
00:41:25,702 --> 00:41:30,753
We also found the grave you described--
your wife's grave.

464
00:41:31,134 --> 00:41:34,357
The grave you said you dug
with your own bare hands.

465
00:41:35,290 --> 00:41:41,224
It was all there. Your whole story,
your alibi-- it was true.

466
00:41:44,347 --> 00:41:47,344
But still I did not
believe it to be true.

467
00:41:47,616 --> 00:41:49,926
So I dug up that grave,

468
00:41:52,930 --> 00:41:57,057
and found that there was not a
woman inside. There was a man.

469
00:42:01,452 --> 00:42:03,344
A man named Henry Gale.
