1
00:02:12,012 --> 00:02:15,539
- They don't understand, Sergeant.
- They understand. Listen up.

2
00:02:15,615 --> 00:02:18,675
I'll fire on three. One, two...

3
00:02:24,991 --> 00:02:27,391
You.

4
00:02:27,461 --> 00:02:30,259
- You in charge?
- No, I am not.

5
00:02:30,330 --> 00:02:32,821
Who is?

6
00:02:34,968 --> 00:02:37,937
There is no commanding officer here.

7
00:02:38,004 --> 00:02:41,132
He left two hours ago for Hillah.

8
00:02:41,208 --> 00:02:43,472
Your English is good, Abdul.

9
00:02:43,543 --> 00:02:46,671
But you're lying.
And that ain't so good.

10
00:02:57,724 --> 00:03:01,160
Delta 17,
this is Charlie 46...

11
00:03:01,228 --> 00:03:03,219
That's him, Sergeant.

12
00:03:05,265 --> 00:03:07,256
Let's go, hombre.

13
00:03:11,371 --> 00:03:15,569
Son, we don't wanna be here
any more than you do,

14
00:03:15,642 --> 00:03:19,373
but your pal Saddam
had to go marching into Kuwait.

15
00:03:19,446 --> 00:03:22,176
Here we all are.

16
00:03:22,249 --> 00:03:25,912
Buccelli here says you speak English.
You ever do any translating?

17
00:03:25,986 --> 00:03:28,181
Formally, no.

18
00:03:28,255 --> 00:03:29,517
Hell.

19
00:03:29,589 --> 00:03:34,049
Fact that you know
what "formally" means... We're good.

20
00:03:35,896 --> 00:03:38,922
Apache helicopter went down
in this sector two days ago.

21
00:03:38,999 --> 00:03:41,331
Our sources tell us
the pilot was captured.

22
00:03:41,401 --> 00:03:44,461
It's very important
that we get this pilot back.

23
00:03:44,538 --> 00:03:47,996
He was taken to the Republican
Guard intelligence commander,

24
00:03:48,074 --> 00:03:50,872
a man named Tariq.

25
00:03:50,944 --> 00:03:54,846
- Do you know him?
- Yes. He was our commanding officer.

26
00:03:54,915 --> 00:03:57,884
Do you know where he is?

27
00:03:57,951 --> 00:04:01,546
When the bombing started,
he fled to Hillah.

28
00:04:03,089 --> 00:04:04,647
Hillah, huh?

29
00:04:06,092 --> 00:04:08,356
Yes, that is right.

30
00:04:13,867 --> 00:04:15,858
Welcome to Hillah.

31
00:04:33,219 --> 00:04:35,210
Where's Jack?

32
00:04:36,222 --> 00:04:38,213
Why?

33
00:04:46,566 --> 00:04:49,057
There. See?

34
00:04:52,806 --> 00:04:54,899
Go back. I'll deal with this.

35
00:04:54,975 --> 00:04:57,205
What?

36
00:04:57,277 --> 00:05:01,611
Go back, Ana Lucia.
And don't tell anyone what you saw.

37
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:36,642
What are you doing here, Danielle?

38
00:05:38,284 --> 00:05:40,844
Looking for you.

39
00:05:59,072 --> 00:06:01,063
Where are we going?

40
00:06:01,941 --> 00:06:05,069
You said you were looking for me.
What was your plan?

41
00:06:05,145 --> 00:06:08,546
To hide in the woods,
hoping I would pass you by?

42
00:06:08,615 --> 00:06:11,846
I was going to wait until dark,
and then find you at your tent.

43
00:06:11,918 --> 00:06:13,909
Why?

44
00:06:16,723 --> 00:06:20,352
- We need to keep moving.
- Tell me where we are moving to.

45
00:06:20,427 --> 00:06:22,759
Trust me.

46
00:06:22,829 --> 00:06:27,528
The last time we met, you warned us the
Others were coming, which they weren't.

47
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:30,967
In fact, it was a diversion
to kidnap Claire's baby.

48
00:06:31,037 --> 00:06:33,801
So pardon me for not trusting you.

49
00:06:35,909 --> 00:06:38,434
This place I am taking you to,

50
00:06:38,511 --> 00:06:42,538
there is something that will help you,
something important.

51
00:06:46,986 --> 00:06:48,977
As for trust,

52
00:06:52,358 --> 00:06:54,087
take this.

53
00:07:01,134 --> 00:07:04,262
If I'm lying, it's yours to use.

54
00:07:10,643 --> 00:07:12,634
How much further?

55
00:07:13,747 --> 00:07:15,271
Not far.

56
00:07:17,283 --> 00:07:20,013
Ask him where he took the pilot.

57
00:07:32,632 --> 00:07:34,827
He says he does not know.

58
00:07:34,901 --> 00:07:38,496
We know for a fact he interrogated
the pilot day before yesterday.

59
00:07:38,571 --> 00:07:40,562
Hell, probably in this room.

60
00:07:42,175 --> 00:07:44,609
Tell him,

61
00:07:44,677 --> 00:07:47,737
we get our man back safe and sound,
he goes free.

62
00:08:14,774 --> 00:08:17,436
What's he saying?

63
00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:19,740
He says he does not know.

64
00:08:21,748 --> 00:08:25,206
I was born,
but I wasn't born yesterday, son.

65
00:08:25,285 --> 00:08:28,379
You don't help me out here,
someone else will take over,

66
00:08:28,454 --> 00:08:33,790
and that someone,
he won't play nice at all.

67
00:08:36,529 --> 00:08:40,295
I am sorry. He does not know.

68
00:08:42,869 --> 00:08:45,531
OK. You had your chance.

69
00:08:47,574 --> 00:08:48,700
Guards.

70
00:08:50,310 --> 00:08:52,778
Lock him back up.

71
00:09:13,333 --> 00:09:15,324
This is unbelievable.

72
00:09:23,810 --> 00:09:27,211
Hey. Hey, you hear that thing?

73
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:29,646
You hear that frog? Frog?

74
00:09:31,351 --> 00:09:33,683
You wanna help me find it?

75
00:09:36,522 --> 00:09:38,547
What? We ain't friends anymore?

76
00:10:08,588 --> 00:10:11,250
- What you got there, Rerun?
- Nothing.

77
00:10:14,127 --> 00:10:18,530
Yeah, well, you got a spot of nothing
on your chin there.

78
00:10:21,935 --> 00:10:24,665
Dharma Initiative Ranch Dressing?

79
00:10:25,705 --> 00:10:29,607
You're supposed to refrigerate that
after you open it.

80
00:10:29,676 --> 00:10:31,507
Actually, on the back it says

81
00:10:31,577 --> 00:10:34,307
it'll keep at room temperature
for up to seven years.

82
00:10:37,784 --> 00:10:41,743
Well, well.
Looky who's got a secret stash.

83
00:10:41,821 --> 00:10:44,016
Please, dude. You can't tell.

84
00:10:44,090 --> 00:10:46,558
What? That you stole food
from the group?

85
00:10:49,095 --> 00:10:51,086
Now, why would I wanna do that?

86
00:10:51,164 --> 00:10:53,155
Come on, man. Please.

87
00:10:54,968 --> 00:10:56,959
Son of a bitch.

88
00:10:59,472 --> 00:11:02,407
- Dude, it's just a tree frog.
- Have you seen it?

89
00:11:02,475 --> 00:11:04,466
Yeah.

90
00:11:06,679 --> 00:11:08,943
Tell you what,
you help me find that thing,

91
00:11:09,015 --> 00:11:12,280
you can keep right on Ranch dipping.

92
00:11:12,352 --> 00:11:14,343
We got a deal?

93
00:11:16,456 --> 00:11:18,447
How much further?

94
00:11:19,726 --> 00:11:22,024
- Danielle?
- We're here.

95
00:11:22,095 --> 00:11:24,791
And where exactly is "here"?

96
00:11:28,368 --> 00:11:30,598
What is that for, Danielle?

97
00:11:30,670 --> 00:11:32,729
Help me!

98
00:11:32,805 --> 00:11:36,070
Hey! Over here!

99
00:11:39,512 --> 00:11:41,139
Wait.

100
00:11:41,214 --> 00:11:43,705
- Help!
- Sayid, listen to me.

101
00:11:43,783 --> 00:11:47,082
Hey! Hey!

102
00:11:47,153 --> 00:11:49,451
Over here!

103
00:11:49,522 --> 00:11:52,719
Please! Help me!

104
00:11:54,827 --> 00:11:58,126
- Help me!
- Don't believe a word he says.

105
00:11:58,197 --> 00:12:01,633
- Hey!
- He's one of them.

106
00:12:01,701 --> 00:12:05,501
I have no idea what she's talking about.
She's crazy.

107
00:12:05,571 --> 00:12:08,165
- How long has he been up there?
- Since last night.

108
00:12:08,241 --> 00:12:11,642
Please just cut me down.
My name is Henry Gale.

109
00:12:11,711 --> 00:12:13,702
I'm from Minnesota.

110
00:12:17,050 --> 00:12:19,041
- Please.
- He's lying.

111
00:12:23,089 --> 00:12:25,649
- I'm going to cut him down.
- Don't.

112
00:12:26,893 --> 00:12:30,329
- Thank you.
- You're making a serious mistake.

113
00:12:34,567 --> 00:12:38,663
It's OK. It's OK.
You're all right. You're all right.

114
00:12:40,807 --> 00:12:43,241
Hold on.

115
00:12:43,776 --> 00:12:46,574
Take it easy.

116
00:12:48,815 --> 00:12:51,511
- No.
- Wait.

117
00:12:51,584 --> 00:12:53,916
Danielle, don't.

118
00:13:15,108 --> 00:13:18,134
You could have killed him.

119
00:13:18,211 --> 00:13:20,873
If I wanted to kill him,
I would have killed him.

120
00:13:23,082 --> 00:13:28,543
- You shot this man with no provocation.
- He is one of them.

121
00:13:28,621 --> 00:13:30,589
Tie him up.

122
00:13:31,290 --> 00:13:34,953
You should take him to your doctor.
He's no good to you dead.

123
00:13:35,027 --> 00:13:37,621
And then what?

124
00:13:37,697 --> 00:13:40,188
You'll talk to him, Sayid.

125
00:13:40,266 --> 00:13:43,258
As I recall, that is what you do.

126
00:13:46,506 --> 00:13:49,498
But know this: He will lie.

127
00:13:50,743 --> 00:13:53,803
For a long time, he will lie.

128
00:14:33,953 --> 00:14:38,117
I wanna talk to you
about your buddy, Tariq.

129
00:14:41,227 --> 00:14:46,164
Ah, look, I get it.
You're a man who values loyalty.

130
00:14:46,232 --> 00:14:48,393
Even doing a little translating for us,

131
00:14:48,467 --> 00:14:51,231
you feel like
you're doing the wrong thing.

132
00:14:51,304 --> 00:14:54,501
I get that, and I respect it.

133
00:14:58,711 --> 00:15:00,702
This is what Tariq was doing

134
00:15:00,780 --> 00:15:05,012
before he took over command
of your intelligence unit.

135
00:15:05,084 --> 00:15:08,781
He was the head of a chemical warfare
battalion in the north.

136
00:15:08,854 --> 00:15:12,449
Personally supervised
the use of sarin gas on this village.

137
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:23,664
You recognize it, don't you?

138
00:15:24,570 --> 00:15:27,368
You had relatives in that village
didn't you, Sayid?

139
00:15:32,245 --> 00:15:34,805
So, you know what sarin gas does.

140
00:15:37,049 --> 00:15:39,517
No discrimination.

141
00:15:39,585 --> 00:15:41,576
The entire marketplace.

142
00:15:41,654 --> 00:15:44,714
Innocent women, children.

143
00:15:50,896 --> 00:15:53,091
Enough.

144
00:15:53,165 --> 00:15:55,156
Please.

145
00:15:59,438 --> 00:16:02,134
Loyalty is a virtue.

146
00:16:03,376 --> 00:16:05,435
But unquestioning loyalty...

147
00:16:06,912 --> 00:16:09,244
I don't think that's you.

148
00:16:11,217 --> 00:16:13,879
Why should I believe you?

149
00:16:15,121 --> 00:16:18,215
How do you think we knew
you had relatives in that village?

150
00:16:18,291 --> 00:16:22,591
We liberated your personnel file
and Tariq's.

151
00:16:27,967 --> 00:16:30,458
All we want is our pilot back,

152
00:16:30,536 --> 00:16:33,664
so we can send him home to his family.

153
00:16:37,710 --> 00:16:40,235
Tariq will never talk to you.

154
00:16:41,113 --> 00:16:44,514
That's why you're gonna
have to make him talk to you.

155
00:16:52,992 --> 00:16:55,483
John. John, wake up.

156
00:17:01,434 --> 00:17:04,528
- What?
- Come out here.

157
00:17:13,346 --> 00:17:15,337
Minnesota, huh?

158
00:17:17,350 --> 00:17:21,116
That's the question, isn't it?

159
00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:28,993
Wh... Where am I?

160
00:17:29,061 --> 00:17:32,224
- Who are you?
- Henry. Henry Gale.

161
00:17:32,298 --> 00:17:34,289
Ah, my back.

162
00:17:36,068 --> 00:17:39,299
We're going to take it out,
but first I want you to relax.

163
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:42,931
How did you get to this island?

164
00:17:43,008 --> 00:17:46,535
Four months ago.
We crashed, my wife and I.

165
00:17:46,612 --> 00:17:48,603
Crashed in what?

166
00:17:48,681 --> 00:17:52,879
A balloon.
We were trying to cross the Pacific.

167
00:17:55,755 --> 00:17:58,087
Your wife, where is she?

168
00:17:59,592 --> 00:18:02,618
She died. She got...

169
00:18:03,863 --> 00:18:06,525
She got sick, three weeks ago.

170
00:18:08,167 --> 00:18:13,127
We were staying in a cave off the beach.

171
00:18:13,205 --> 00:18:15,605
My shoulder.

172
00:18:16,475 --> 00:18:18,500
At least untie my arms.

173
00:18:18,577 --> 00:18:21,068
What the hell's going on here?

174
00:18:21,881 --> 00:18:25,044
Rousseau trapped him in the jungle.

175
00:18:26,285 --> 00:18:30,915
- She believes he's an Other.
- Another what?

176
00:18:30,990 --> 00:18:33,925
- You shot him with an arrow?
- Do I have a bow?

177
00:18:35,161 --> 00:18:37,994
Hey, hey. You with me?

178
00:18:39,565 --> 00:18:44,195
- You were gonna let him bleed to death?
- I was trying to get honest answers.

179
00:18:45,104 --> 00:18:48,198
And his wound
is far from life-threatening.

180
00:18:48,274 --> 00:18:51,766
We should let Jack treat him first.
Then we'll get our answers.

181
00:18:51,844 --> 00:18:55,302
Jack. Do not untie him.

182
00:19:08,194 --> 00:19:11,254
This is how people get killed
in scary movies.

183
00:19:11,330 --> 00:19:15,164
If this were a scary movie, I'd be
with a hot chick, not you, Barbar.

184
00:19:18,270 --> 00:19:20,966
- It's Babar.
- Why don't you shut up, Hammo?

185
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:26,501
Or your Ranch disorder's gonna be the
new lead item on the coconut internet.

186
00:19:26,579 --> 00:19:29,343
Fine. Go ahead.

187
00:19:30,216 --> 00:19:33,379
Tell everyone the fat guy's
been hiding Ranch dressing.

188
00:19:33,452 --> 00:19:35,920
The fat guy likes to eat.

189
00:19:36,655 --> 00:19:38,646
Yeah, I'm fat.

190
00:19:38,724 --> 00:19:43,127
Fat, fat, fat, fat, fat.
You think I don't know that?

191
00:19:43,796 --> 00:19:45,627
At least people like me.

192
00:19:48,334 --> 00:19:51,326
Well, find the damn frog by yourself.

193
00:19:52,338 --> 00:19:55,068
Hurley, wait. Wait. Hey, Hurley.

194
00:19:57,376 --> 00:19:59,936
Look, man, I'm sorry. All right?

195
00:20:01,213 --> 00:20:05,206
But this frog is killing me.
You gotta help me out.

196
00:20:05,284 --> 00:20:06,808
Please.

197
00:20:44,390 --> 00:20:47,757
- So, what do you think?
- What do you think, John?

198
00:20:49,528 --> 00:20:52,019
I think he's pretty convincing.

199
00:20:54,266 --> 00:20:56,564
Yes, he is.

200
00:20:57,803 --> 00:21:01,398
The real problem is there's no way
we can be sure he's telling the truth.

201
00:21:04,043 --> 00:21:06,443
That is not necessarily true.

202
00:21:09,682 --> 00:21:12,207
Does Jack have the combination
to the armory?

203
00:21:14,553 --> 00:21:17,454
For now he does.

204
00:21:17,523 --> 00:21:20,754
How long would it take
for you to change it?

205
00:21:31,303 --> 00:21:35,603
If you're angry,
looking for someone to punish...

206
00:21:35,674 --> 00:21:38,905
Why would I need to punish anyone?

207
00:21:44,350 --> 00:21:47,376
I want to find out who he is.

208
00:21:47,453 --> 00:21:50,547
I want the truth.

209
00:21:50,623 --> 00:21:55,356
We both know that Jack will have issues
with what must be done to get it.

210
00:22:01,233 --> 00:22:05,567
So, how long, John,
to change the combination?

211
00:22:05,638 --> 00:22:08,072
Couple of minutes, tops.

212
00:22:08,907 --> 00:22:12,240
Then I suggest you get started.

213
00:22:25,190 --> 00:22:27,920
- Did he say anything while...
- No, he didn't.

214
00:22:29,495 --> 00:22:31,486
He was in shock.

215
00:22:34,299 --> 00:22:36,790
We can't just leave him laying here,
Jack.

216
00:22:36,869 --> 00:22:39,303
People will see him.
It'll create a panic.

217
00:22:39,371 --> 00:22:43,205
- Where do you think we should put him?
- I say we put him in the armory.

218
00:22:43,275 --> 00:22:45,607
It's secure.

219
00:22:45,678 --> 00:22:49,546
Better to err on the side of safety,
Jack, at least until we can be sure.

220
00:22:56,088 --> 00:22:58,113
OK.

221
00:22:58,190 --> 00:23:00,181
For now.

222
00:23:27,586 --> 00:23:31,852
We can pull that cot in here.
He shouldn't be on his back.

223
00:23:31,924 --> 00:23:33,915
Good idea.

224
00:23:42,301 --> 00:23:44,292
Sayid.

225
00:23:45,404 --> 00:23:48,339
Hey. What the hell are you doing? Sayid.

226
00:23:48,407 --> 00:23:51,672
- What needs to be done.
- Hey!

227
00:25:59,504 --> 00:26:02,667
The pilot was executed two days ago.

228
00:26:02,741 --> 00:26:07,041
He is buried in a field
four kilometers from here.

229
00:26:07,112 --> 00:26:09,444
I can take you there.

230
00:26:29,034 --> 00:26:31,696
Damn it. Sayid, open the door.

231
00:26:33,438 --> 00:26:35,269
- Sayid, answer me.
- Jack.

232
00:26:36,708 --> 00:26:40,166
Why isn't this combination working,
John?

233
00:26:41,313 --> 00:26:43,543
Did you change it?

234
00:26:43,615 --> 00:26:45,446
Yeah.

235
00:26:47,352 --> 00:26:49,877
Why would you do that?

236
00:26:49,955 --> 00:26:53,755
- You're raising an army.
- What?

237
00:26:53,825 --> 00:26:55,884
Why you didn't ask me is your business.

238
00:26:55,961 --> 00:27:00,523
But there's only one reason to raise an
army, and that's because we're at war.

239
00:27:02,067 --> 00:27:05,628
And like it or not, whatever Sayid
has to do behind that door,

240
00:27:05,704 --> 00:27:07,535
that's a part of it, too.

241
00:27:09,374 --> 00:27:11,899
What if he's telling the truth, John?

242
00:27:13,078 --> 00:27:15,546
What if he's not?

243
00:27:27,092 --> 00:27:29,151
Get up.

244
00:27:31,897 --> 00:27:33,558
What's happening?

245
00:27:34,833 --> 00:27:36,824
Here. Let me help you.

246
00:27:44,443 --> 00:27:46,707
You said you've been here
for four months.

247
00:27:46,778 --> 00:27:48,109
What?

248
00:27:48,180 --> 00:27:51,343
You said you came to this island
four months ago, yes?

249
00:27:51,416 --> 00:27:52,906
Where am I?

250
00:27:54,486 --> 00:27:57,819
Please. Answer my question.

251
00:27:57,889 --> 00:28:02,087
Yeah, yes. We landed four months ago.

252
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:04,924
Maybe more. Who are you?

253
00:28:04,997 --> 00:28:07,022
You were in a cave for all that time?

254
00:28:07,099 --> 00:28:09,329
Off the beach.

255
00:28:09,401 --> 00:28:13,269
- On the north shore of the island.
- How far from where you were captured?

256
00:28:13,338 --> 00:28:15,329
- I don't know.
- How many days walk?

257
00:28:15,407 --> 00:28:18,934
- Two. Two days.
- Why did you stay on the beach so long?

258
00:28:19,011 --> 00:28:21,002
Why wouldn't we?

259
00:28:21,813 --> 00:28:24,543
We wanted to be there for flyovers.

260
00:28:24,616 --> 00:28:27,107
We had an emergency beacon,
a transmitter.

261
00:28:27,185 --> 00:28:30,348
- What kind of transmitter?
- An ADF beacon.

262
00:28:31,623 --> 00:28:33,955
We wanted to make sure we'd be spotted.

263
00:28:37,763 --> 00:28:41,358
Look, whatever you think I am, I'm not.

264
00:28:43,201 --> 00:28:47,604
Please, please, just tell me your name.

265
00:28:47,672 --> 00:28:49,799
Your wife. What is her maiden name?

266
00:28:49,875 --> 00:28:52,537
- Murphy.
- Where did you meet her?

267
00:28:52,611 --> 00:28:55,546
- University of Minnesota.
- How did she die?

268
00:28:55,614 --> 00:28:57,605
She got sick.

269
00:28:58,784 --> 00:29:00,911
She got sick?

270
00:29:03,088 --> 00:29:05,613
It started as a fever.

271
00:29:05,690 --> 00:29:09,182
After two days, she was delirious.

272
00:29:11,396 --> 00:29:13,387
Then she died.

273
00:29:23,642 --> 00:29:26,202
I don't know why
you're asking these questions.

274
00:29:26,278 --> 00:29:30,681
I don't know why
you're treating me this way,

275
00:29:30,749 --> 00:29:33,217
why I have to explain to you who I am

276
00:29:33,285 --> 00:29:35,685
when you don't tell me who you are.

277
00:29:35,754 --> 00:29:39,281
I was 23 years old when the Americans
came to my country.

278
00:29:40,892 --> 00:29:44,089
I was a good man. I was a soldier.

279
00:29:45,664 --> 00:29:50,226
And when they left,
I was something different.

280
00:29:51,069 --> 00:29:53,663
For the next six years

281
00:29:53,738 --> 00:29:56,366
I did things I wish I could erase
from my memory,

282
00:29:56,441 --> 00:29:59,968
things which I never thought myself
to be capable of.

283
00:30:02,714 --> 00:30:05,046
But I did come to learn this.

284
00:30:06,418 --> 00:30:09,751
There is a part of me
which was always capable.

285
00:30:12,124 --> 00:30:15,252
You want to know who I am.

286
00:30:18,730 --> 00:30:22,598
My name is Sayid Jarrah,

287
00:30:22,667 --> 00:30:24,999
and I am a torturer.

288
00:30:39,284 --> 00:30:41,377
Where is it?

289
00:30:41,453 --> 00:30:43,444
There it is.

290
00:30:54,432 --> 00:30:56,024
Gotcha.

291
00:30:56,101 --> 00:30:58,433
Dude, nice catch.

292
00:30:58,503 --> 00:31:00,767
Well, I'll be damned.

293
00:31:00,839 --> 00:31:03,330
All that noise from this tiny critter.

294
00:31:04,576 --> 00:31:09,138
Kind of reminds me of a turtle
I once had. His name was Stewart.

295
00:31:09,214 --> 00:31:11,512
He ran off when I was ten.

296
00:31:11,583 --> 00:31:14,313
Well, that's what Mom said.

297
00:31:14,386 --> 00:31:16,377
I kind of think she threw him out.

298
00:31:20,825 --> 00:31:24,454
Wow, you're a happy little fellow,
ain't you?

299
00:31:30,569 --> 00:31:33,470
I have an idea.

300
00:31:33,538 --> 00:31:36,530
Why don't I take him far from here?

301
00:31:37,609 --> 00:31:42,444
Two beaches away.
Maybe he'll find a Mrs. Tree Frog.

302
00:31:42,514 --> 00:31:46,416
That way he won't keep you up anymore
and everyone's happy.

303
00:31:49,387 --> 00:31:51,719
Yeah, that's one idea.

304
00:31:53,358 --> 00:31:55,349
Here's another.

305
00:31:58,430 --> 00:32:00,489
Dude.

306
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:05,661
I hear with a little Ranch
they taste just like chicken.

307
00:32:32,764 --> 00:32:35,096
Give you a hand?

308
00:32:42,073 --> 00:32:44,405
- Jack, I know this isn't...
- Shut up.

309
00:32:59,324 --> 00:33:01,656
Where are the pliers?

310
00:33:03,461 --> 00:33:05,793
Tell me about this balloon.

311
00:33:07,365 --> 00:33:09,959
- What?
- This balloon that brought you here.

312
00:33:10,035 --> 00:33:13,562
- Tell me about it.
- What do you wanna know?

313
00:33:14,406 --> 00:33:16,397
Everything.

314
00:33:20,612 --> 00:33:23,604
She's 140 feet high, 60 feet wide.

315
00:33:26,151 --> 00:33:29,314
And when she's up in the air,
550,000 cubic feet of helium

316
00:33:29,387 --> 00:33:31,753
and 100,000 of hot air keep her up.

317
00:33:33,892 --> 00:33:35,985
And if you could look down on her,

318
00:33:36,061 --> 00:33:40,293
you'd see
a big yellow smiley face on top.

319
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:44,327
Why would you travel in that way?

320
00:33:47,138 --> 00:33:52,940
Because I was rich.
Because it was my dream.

321
00:33:56,481 --> 00:33:59,450
And Jennifer thought it would be neat.

322
00:34:00,652 --> 00:34:02,119
You were rich.

323
00:34:08,526 --> 00:34:11,654
I guess I'm thinking of things
in the past tense now.

324
00:34:11,730 --> 00:34:14,255
How's that for optimism?

325
00:34:14,332 --> 00:34:17,233
What did you do to become so rich?

326
00:34:18,870 --> 00:34:21,703
- I sold my company.
- What kind of company?

327
00:34:21,773 --> 00:34:23,798
- Mining.
- What did you mine?

328
00:34:25,210 --> 00:34:27,508
We mined nonmetallic minerals.

329
00:34:30,582 --> 00:34:33,517
I know. Everyone wanted to talk to me
at cocktail parties.

330
00:34:41,793 --> 00:34:43,784
Give me your hands.

331
00:34:45,029 --> 00:34:47,020
Give me your hands.

332
00:34:53,705 --> 00:34:55,798
- Where is she buried?
- What?

333
00:34:55,874 --> 00:34:57,739
Listen to me.

334
00:34:57,809 --> 00:35:00,437
You said you buried your wife.
Tell me where.

335
00:35:01,246 --> 00:35:02,736
- What are you...
- Where?

336
00:35:02,814 --> 00:35:07,410
In the jungle.
By the balloon. In the jungle.

337
00:35:07,485 --> 00:35:10,784
How deep?
How deep did you dig the grave?

338
00:35:10,855 --> 00:35:14,848
- I don't...
- How many shovelfuls of earth?

339
00:35:14,926 --> 00:35:17,656
Did you use your hands?
How long did it take you?

340
00:35:17,729 --> 00:35:20,823
- I don't remember.
- You would remember.

341
00:35:20,899 --> 00:35:22,890
You would remember how deep.

342
00:35:22,967 --> 00:35:26,027
You would remember every shovelful,
every moment.

343
00:35:26,738 --> 00:35:30,697
You would remember what it felt like
to place her body inside.

344
00:35:31,776 --> 00:35:35,268
You would remember
if you buried the woman you loved.

345
00:35:36,414 --> 00:35:40,077
You would remember if it were true.

346
00:35:43,555 --> 00:35:46,251
Did you lose someone?

347
00:35:47,559 --> 00:35:51,723
Did you lose someone here on the island?
Did you lose someone, too?

348
00:35:51,796 --> 00:35:53,764
What happened to her?

349
00:35:58,703 --> 00:36:02,639
It was an accident. It was an accident.

350
00:36:02,707 --> 00:36:06,268
The woman responsible
thought she was someone else,

351
00:36:06,344 --> 00:36:11,145
someone coming to hurt her,
someone like you.

352
00:36:11,216 --> 00:36:14,083
Just, just... This is all a mistake.

353
00:36:14,152 --> 00:36:16,643
Slow down here, OK?

354
00:36:16,721 --> 00:36:20,748
- Hurting me isn't gonna bring her back.
- You know what I lost.

355
00:36:20,825 --> 00:36:23,760
- Tell me the truth.
- No, stop.

356
00:36:23,828 --> 00:36:28,265
- Tell me who you are.
- No, no, no. Help. Stop.

357
00:36:28,333 --> 00:36:30,494
Tell me the truth.

358
00:36:30,568 --> 00:36:33,230
- Tell me who you are.
- Stop, please.

359
00:36:33,304 --> 00:36:35,602
- Sayid.
- I've told you everything.

360
00:36:35,673 --> 00:36:37,231
- Sayid.
- Jack.

361
00:36:37,308 --> 00:36:40,334
- Tell me what I already know.
- Open it.

362
00:36:40,411 --> 00:36:42,675
- Open it now, John.
- This has to happen.

363
00:36:43,715 --> 00:36:46,946
You open that damn door,
you understand me? You open it now.

364
00:36:47,018 --> 00:36:49,282
- No.
- Now.

365
00:36:53,758 --> 00:36:57,194
- You're lying!
- What do you want me to say?

366
00:36:57,262 --> 00:37:00,663
Whatever you want me to do, I'll do it.
Just, please...

367
00:37:02,066 --> 00:37:03,966
I want you to tell me the truth.

368
00:37:04,035 --> 00:37:05,832
Open the door.

369
00:37:07,872 --> 00:37:10,636
- Let go of me, Jack.
- Or what? Wanna push the button?

370
00:37:10,708 --> 00:37:13,233
Open the door.

371
00:37:17,682 --> 00:37:20,446
It's under a minute now, John.
You better think fast.

372
00:37:20,518 --> 00:37:23,510
- You wouldn't.
- What? I wouldn't what?

373
00:37:23,588 --> 00:37:26,955
If we don't...
You would risk everyone's lives?

374
00:37:27,025 --> 00:37:31,553
You talked me into pushing that button
once, John, but it's yours now.

375
00:37:31,629 --> 00:37:33,722
You're the one who won't risk it. You.

376
00:37:33,798 --> 00:37:36,665
I don't think anything's gonna happen
when we get to zero.

377
00:37:36,734 --> 00:37:38,395
- Jack.
- You wanna see?

378
00:37:38,469 --> 00:37:41,370
Let's just see what's gonna happen.

379
00:37:41,439 --> 00:37:43,805
Who are you?

380
00:37:43,875 --> 00:37:45,103
Who are you?!

381
00:37:50,748 --> 00:37:53,410
OK, OK, OK. Right 15, left...

382
00:37:53,484 --> 00:37:55,975
You think I'm stupid? You open it.

383
00:38:12,870 --> 00:38:14,861
Hey, hey.

384
00:38:37,028 --> 00:38:39,724
He's lying.

385
00:38:39,797 --> 00:38:41,765
I'll tell you whatever you want.

386
00:38:41,833 --> 00:38:44,996
He's lying! He's lying!

387
00:38:45,069 --> 00:38:47,060
That's enough!

388
00:39:01,919 --> 00:39:04,080
What the hell was that?

389
00:39:04,989 --> 00:39:09,756
- He is one of them.
- Yeah? Did he tell you that?

390
00:39:09,827 --> 00:39:12,318
- No.
- Then how do you know?

391
00:39:13,731 --> 00:39:17,690
Because I know. He is one of them.

392
00:39:20,405 --> 00:39:23,636
I think that's what Rousseau thought
about you once, Sayid.

393
00:39:23,708 --> 00:39:26,108
She strapped you down, she shocked you,

394
00:39:26,177 --> 00:39:29,340
all because she thought
you were one of them.

395
00:39:29,414 --> 00:39:31,541
He is.

396
00:39:31,616 --> 00:39:34,676
- What?
- He is one of them.

397
00:39:34,752 --> 00:39:38,711
To Rousseau, we're all Others.

398
00:39:40,725 --> 00:39:42,659
I guess it's all relative, huh?

399
00:40:13,991 --> 00:40:16,482
You got a wife? Kids?

400
00:40:35,780 --> 00:40:40,217
Come on down. Hurry up.
Get out. Get out. Stop there.

401
00:40:40,284 --> 00:40:42,548
Get over here. Keep your eyes peeled.

402
00:40:46,691 --> 00:40:48,682
I'll take him.

403
00:40:53,931 --> 00:40:56,729
It's over. We're pulling out,
not going to Baghdad.

404
00:40:58,369 --> 00:41:00,360
Your man Saddam gets to stay in power,

405
00:41:00,438 --> 00:41:05,068
which means you, in all likelihood,
will remain in his employ.

406
00:41:05,143 --> 00:41:08,601
I guess you're lucky
you have a new skill set you can use.

407
00:41:10,181 --> 00:41:14,777
What you made me do, no human being
should ever have to do to another.

408
00:41:31,235 --> 00:41:34,068
I will never do that again.

409
00:41:36,574 --> 00:41:38,565
Yeah.

410
00:41:42,146 --> 00:41:45,309
Good luck to you, Sayid.

411
00:41:46,217 --> 00:41:49,050
Bus fare back to Ramadi.

412
00:41:49,120 --> 00:41:51,588
Let's move out.

413
00:42:15,112 --> 00:42:17,774
There is a man down in the hatch.

414
00:42:19,150 --> 00:42:21,812
A stranger captured by Rousseau.

415
00:42:24,021 --> 00:42:26,012
I beat him.

416
00:42:27,859 --> 00:42:29,850
I beat him badly.

417
00:42:34,265 --> 00:42:36,961
Why are you telling me this, Sayid?

418
00:42:39,303 --> 00:42:41,703
Jack asked me how I knew,

419
00:42:41,772 --> 00:42:44,536
knew for sure that this man was lying,

420
00:42:45,276 --> 00:42:50,509
how I knew for sure that he was
one of them, one of the Others.

421
00:42:51,816 --> 00:42:55,217
I know because I feel no guilt
for what I did to him.

422
00:43:04,128 --> 00:43:09,156
But there is no way I can ever
explain that to Jack, or even Locke,

423
00:43:09,233 --> 00:43:11,599
because both of them have forgotten.

424
00:43:12,336 --> 00:43:14,327
Forgotten? What?

425
00:43:16,007 --> 00:43:19,238
That you were strung up by your neck
and left for dead.

426
00:43:19,310 --> 00:43:23,838
That Claire was kept for days during
which God knows what happened to her.

427
00:43:23,915 --> 00:43:27,783
That these people, these Others,

428
00:43:27,852 --> 00:43:30,150
are merciless

429
00:43:30,221 --> 00:43:33,213
and can take any one of us
whenever they choose.

430
00:43:40,197 --> 00:43:42,188
So, tell me, Charlie,

431
00:43:44,368 --> 00:43:46,359
have you forgotten?
