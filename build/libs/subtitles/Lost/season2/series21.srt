00:00:02,856 --> 00:00:04,649
<i>Previously on Lost:</i>

2
00:00:10,029 --> 00:00:13,240
l need you to go up through the grate
and into the vents.

3
00:00:13,324 --> 00:00:15,159
That button has to be pushed.

4
00:00:15,242 --> 00:00:16,618
OK.

5
00:00:24,667 --> 00:00:28,253
l crawled through your vents
and l stood at your computer.

6
00:00:28,337 --> 00:00:29,963
And you know what happened?

7
00:00:30,047 --> 00:00:33,717
Nothing happened, John.
l never entered the numbers.

8
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:36,469
l never pressed the button.

9
00:00:38,179 --> 00:00:40,765
lf you want to do
something nice for Libby,

10
00:00:40,848 --> 00:00:44,018
there's a beautiful beach
three kilometres from here.

11
00:00:44,101 --> 00:00:45,519
You could take her there.

12
00:00:45,603 --> 00:00:47,646
Come on, give me the blankets.

13
00:00:47,729 --> 00:00:52,192
- Blankets?
- l will handle the blankets, OK?

14
00:00:52,275 --> 00:00:54,235
Take us to the guns. Now.

15
00:00:54,319 --> 00:00:58,614
Oh, that bitch.
She stole my damn gun. Ana Lucia.

16
00:00:59,657 --> 00:01:01,158
Why would she need a gun?

17
00:01:01,241 --> 00:01:05,828
We caught one of them. The Others.
He's locked up in there.

18
00:01:05,912 --> 00:01:08,289
Give me the gun. l'll kill him.

19
00:01:08,373 --> 00:01:10,041
l'm sorry.

20
00:01:14,087 --> 00:01:15,545
Michael?

21
00:01:33,688 --> 00:01:35,730
What are you building?

22
00:01:42,278 --> 00:01:45,489
- Hello, Ana.
- Well, hello, yourself.

23
00:01:45,572 --> 00:01:48,826
So you gonna tell me? What is it?

24
00:01:48,909 --> 00:01:51,203
l'm building a church.

25
00:01:51,286 --> 00:01:54,122
Now, why the hell
would you wanna do that?

26
00:01:54,205 --> 00:01:58,209
- Because l was told to.
- Told to by who?

27
00:01:58,292 --> 00:02:02,463
l was just told.
l think it was in a dream.

28
00:02:02,547 --> 00:02:04,798
A dream like this one?

29
00:02:14,265 --> 00:02:17,226
You need to help John.

30
00:02:36,452 --> 00:02:38,412
Yemi?

31
00:02:41,998 --> 00:02:43,791
Hello, brother.

32
00:02:43,875 --> 00:02:48,755
Yemi. Forgive me. l should have
listened to you. You were right.

33
00:02:48,838 --> 00:02:50,964
l didn't mean to do what l did.

34
00:02:52,215 --> 00:02:56,011
The work being done
in this place is important, Eko.

35
00:02:56,094 --> 00:03:00,723
lt is more important than anything,
and it is in danger.

36
00:03:02,475 --> 00:03:05,269
You must help John.

37
00:03:05,353 --> 00:03:07,563
He has lost his way.

38
00:03:07,647 --> 00:03:11,441
You must make him take you
to the question mark.

39
00:03:23,118 --> 00:03:26,330
John will not want to show you,
so you must make him.

40
00:03:28,582 --> 00:03:34,545
Eko. There are many distractions,
brother, but you must move past them.

41
00:03:34,629 --> 00:03:38,257
What is done is done. Do you understand?

42
00:03:39,466 --> 00:03:41,885
Yes, Yemi.

43
00:03:44,179 --> 00:03:47,641
And, Eko? Bring the axe.

44
00:03:56,107 --> 00:03:58,108
What's the matter?

45
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:10,202
You all right, mate?

46
00:04:17,875 --> 00:04:20,211
l need to find John.

47
00:04:23,506 --> 00:04:25,883
- What were you thinking?
- Leave him alone.

48
00:04:25,967 --> 00:04:27,801
- No, don't.
- Shut it, Sawyer.

49
00:04:27,884 --> 00:04:30,178
- lf Ana hadn't lifted your gun...
- Swell.

50
00:04:30,262 --> 00:04:34,057
Gimpy McCrutch covers up that
the Artist Formerly Known As Henry Gale

51
00:04:34,141 --> 00:04:38,311
tried to strangle your little amiga
and it's on me when she goes vigilante.

52
00:04:38,394 --> 00:04:41,814
- How about you go back to the beach?
- Hey, enough. Both of you.

53
00:04:45,234 --> 00:04:47,569
Michael. Hey.

54
00:04:48,778 --> 00:04:50,613
- He shot me.
- Who?

55
00:04:50,697 --> 00:04:53,533
- He's gone. He ran out.
- Go. l got him.

56
00:04:54,618 --> 00:04:58,621
l was sleeping and l heard gunshots.
l got up.

57
00:04:58,704 --> 00:05:02,333
l came out of the bedroom
and there was this guy.

58
00:05:02,416 --> 00:05:04,418
He had a gun and...

59
00:05:06,919 --> 00:05:09,672
All right, come on.
We gotta get you up, all right?

60
00:05:09,756 --> 00:05:12,467
Let me help you.

61
00:05:52,336 --> 00:05:54,837
She's dead.

62
00:06:08,183 --> 00:06:13,980
Kate, we gotta get her up. We gotta
get her up to the back room, OK?

63
00:06:52,139 --> 00:06:56,643
Grant us this mercy, O Lord,
we beseech thee.

64
00:06:56,727 --> 00:06:58,729
Amen.

65
00:07:12,907 --> 00:07:16,745
She's in shock. All right,
we gotta keep pressure on this one.

66
00:07:17,912 --> 00:07:21,290
Can you do anything? Jack?

67
00:07:21,373 --> 00:07:25,419
l heard you.
Just keep pressure on her, OK?

68
00:07:31,424 --> 00:07:34,010
How is she?

69
00:07:34,093 --> 00:07:36,220
l'm doing what l can.

70
00:07:36,304 --> 00:07:39,097
- How long ago?
- What?

71
00:07:39,181 --> 00:07:41,808
When did this happen?
How long ago did he leave?

72
00:07:41,892 --> 00:07:45,938
l don't know.
Twenty minutes, maybe a half-hour ago.

73
00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:50,816
We can pick up the trail,
catch up to him.

74
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:55,363
- Man's got a head start, a gun...
- He shot three people. One's dead.

75
00:07:55,446 --> 00:08:00,450
Who's gonna take care of Libby while
you're off playing Daniel Boone?

76
00:08:01,993 --> 00:08:03,662
l will go.

77
00:08:05,497 --> 00:08:07,873
John, you have tracking experience, yes?

78
00:08:07,957 --> 00:08:09,959
Yeah.

79
00:08:10,793 --> 00:08:13,045
We will find his trail together.

80
00:08:13,128 --> 00:08:15,547
You find anything,
you come right back here

81
00:08:15,631 --> 00:08:20,218
and we figure out
what we're gonna do next together.

82
00:08:26,265 --> 00:08:28,517
Let's go, John.

83
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:36,148
How long has it been
since your last confession?

84
00:08:36,232 --> 00:08:39,443
Good question. Too many years
for me to even remember.

85
00:08:39,527 --> 00:08:42,029
What do you wish
to ask God's forgiveness for?

86
00:08:42,113 --> 00:08:44,824
- What sins have you committed?
- Well, let's see.

87
00:08:44,907 --> 00:08:48,368
Well, l slept with another woman
besides my wife.

88
00:08:48,451 --> 00:08:51,663
- Just once or many times?
- How many is ''many''?

89
00:08:52,747 --> 00:08:57,376
To receive God's forgiveness
you must be penitent for your sins.

90
00:08:57,459 --> 00:09:02,506
l also forged lD papers
for a guy pretending to be a priest.

91
00:09:04,592 --> 00:09:07,010
Do you have it?

92
00:09:12,348 --> 00:09:15,684
So what did you do, Padre?
Skim from the collection plate?

93
00:09:19,313 --> 00:09:24,150
You know, l've got some friends in Los
Angeles. l could get you on with them.

94
00:09:24,233 --> 00:09:28,946
- Doing what?
- You know, stuff.

95
00:09:30,364 --> 00:09:33,284
- Morning, Father Tunde.
- Good morning, Monsignor.

96
00:09:33,366 --> 00:09:38,038
Mr Caldwell has been helping me
arrange my trip to the United States.

97
00:09:38,121 --> 00:09:42,958
l'm sorry, but l've got some bad news.
You're gonna have to postpone your trip.

98
00:09:43,042 --> 00:09:45,836
lt appears we have a miracle.

99
00:09:48,172 --> 00:09:51,258
My daughter, she... she drowned.

100
00:09:51,342 --> 00:09:53,593
l'm very sorry for your loss.

101
00:09:53,676 --> 00:09:57,430
Oh, no, you don't understand.
She came back to life.

102
00:09:59,265 --> 00:10:02,684
We were out in the backblocks
and Charlotte must have slipped

103
00:10:02,768 --> 00:10:08,023
and she went into the river
and she's not much of a swimmer.

104
00:10:08,106 --> 00:10:12,652
She was dead,
and the next day she woke up.

105
00:10:14,236 --> 00:10:17,657
Don't you understand? lt's a miracle.

106
00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:21,035
A confirmation of faith.
Everyone needs to know about this.

107
00:10:21,118 --> 00:10:24,871
- Where is your daughter now?
- At home with my husband.

108
00:10:24,955 --> 00:10:27,457
And what does he think?

109
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:30,543
The world needs to know.
We need to tell the Vatican.

110
00:10:30,627 --> 00:10:34,046
l'm sorry.
We can't just do that, Mrs Malkin.

111
00:10:34,129 --> 00:10:38,968
The church needs to conduct an
investigation before anyone can be told.

112
00:10:39,051 --> 00:10:43,096
Father Tunde will start this process,
if you'll permit him.

113
00:10:46,099 --> 00:10:48,559
Mrs Malkin, would you
excuse us for a moment?

114
00:10:48,643 --> 00:10:50,644
Of course.

115
00:10:54,982 --> 00:10:59,611
Monsignor, with all due respect,
l cannot do what you have asked.

116
00:10:59,694 --> 00:11:01,112
Why not?

117
00:11:01,195 --> 00:11:03,990
Because l do not believe
what this woman says.

118
00:11:05,116 --> 00:11:08,077
Why do you think l chose you?

119
00:11:20,879 --> 00:11:23,882
Are you seeing something l'm not?

120
00:11:23,966 --> 00:11:25,968
Hey.

121
00:11:30,847 --> 00:11:35,852
l haven't seen a single track or
piece of sign since we left the hatch.

122
00:11:35,935 --> 00:11:39,438
- What the hell are you following?
- Where is the question mark?

123
00:11:39,521 --> 00:11:41,648
The what?

124
00:11:44,526 --> 00:11:48,070
The question mark, John. Where is it?

125
00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:54,744
You know what?
You keep chasing after your own shadow.

126
00:11:54,827 --> 00:11:57,746
l'm going back.

127
00:11:58,788 --> 00:12:02,334
l know you do not want to show me,
but you must.

128
00:12:02,417 --> 00:12:06,504
- No, l don't have to show you anything.
- Then l'm sorry.

129
00:12:28,690 --> 00:12:31,235
You hit me.

130
00:12:32,653 --> 00:12:35,738
- Why did you...?
- Because you were being difficult.

131
00:12:37,823 --> 00:12:40,034
Are you insane?

132
00:12:40,117 --> 00:12:42,119
No.

133
00:12:46,081 --> 00:12:50,794
Ana Lucia, your friend,
was just murdered and you...

134
00:12:50,877 --> 00:12:53,380
Ana wants me to help you, John.

135
00:12:55,381 --> 00:12:58,759
- Help me do what?
- Find the question mark.

136
00:13:01,679 --> 00:13:03,931
You don't know
what you're talking about.

137
00:13:04,014 --> 00:13:06,015
No.

138
00:13:10,311 --> 00:13:16,275
But you know what l am talking about,
John, and that is all that matters.

139
00:13:16,358 --> 00:13:19,820
Here. Here. You wanna find
your damn question mark?

140
00:13:19,903 --> 00:13:22,489
Here, this is it right here.
Here, take it.

141
00:13:22,573 --> 00:13:28,119
Because it's nothing. lt's a memory.
lt's ten seconds of nothing.

142
00:13:28,202 --> 00:13:31,080
- This is your hatch, yes?
- lt's not my hatch.

143
00:13:33,623 --> 00:13:38,461
lf the swan is where we came from,
then we go that way.

144
00:13:38,545 --> 00:13:40,505
We shouldn't even be out here.

145
00:13:40,589 --> 00:13:45,259
Ana Lucia would still be alive

146
00:13:45,342 --> 00:13:48,178
if l'd just told Jack
that Henry attacked her.

147
00:13:48,262 --> 00:13:53,099
Now she wants us to go here, John.
She wants us to go here, John. Together.

148
00:13:54,517 --> 00:13:59,272
- She said this in my dream.
- Oh, of course, your dream.

149
00:14:00,231 --> 00:14:03,650
Tell me, John,
haven't you ever followed a dream?

150
00:14:09,281 --> 00:14:12,283
So, the Vatican's really interested
in this one, eh?

151
00:14:12,366 --> 00:14:15,202
That depends
upon what l put in my report.

152
00:14:15,286 --> 00:14:20,041
Why don't you just start
by telling me what happened that night?

153
00:14:20,124 --> 00:14:23,293
Well, l got a call.
That was around 1 a.m.

154
00:14:23,376 --> 00:14:27,839
Ambos brought this girl in dead.
She'd been in the water two hours.

155
00:14:27,923 --> 00:14:30,425
Have you had experience
in this type of death?

156
00:14:30,508 --> 00:14:34,094
Yeah, of course. l'm an undertaker.

157
00:14:34,178 --> 00:14:38,557
Well, l mean, it's my day job.
l'm perfectly qualified to be a coroner.

158
00:14:38,641 --> 00:14:41,809
l mean, l did go to medical school.

159
00:14:43,269 --> 00:14:47,982
And when did you find out
that she was not dead?

160
00:14:48,942 --> 00:14:50,984
During the autopsy.

161
00:14:52,236 --> 00:14:55,030
During the autopsy?

162
00:14:55,113 --> 00:14:58,116
lt's all right.
l didn't expect you to believe me.

163
00:15:01,953 --> 00:15:04,705
l figured you'd want
to have a listen for yourself.

164
00:15:04,789 --> 00:15:08,876
<i>Decedent is a Caucasian female.
She's 16 1 centimetres, 5 1.3 kilos.</i>

165
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:12,754
<i>Body was prepped and washed
by the very lovely Valerie Mc Tavish.</i>

166
00:15:12,837 --> 00:15:15,173
<i>Ian, stop it.</i>

167
00:15:15,257 --> 00:15:18,801
<i>Commencing with the post.
This is a clear case of drowning.</i>

168
00:15:18,884 --> 00:15:21,762
<i>- I'll begin with the thoracic...
- No!</i>

169
00:15:21,845 --> 00:15:24,848
<i>- Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
- Val...</i>

170
00:15:32,564 --> 00:15:34,399
Take it.

171
00:15:34,482 --> 00:15:38,527
No, please. l don't want to ever listen
to that tape again.

172
00:15:53,207 --> 00:15:56,918
- You lost already?
- Your map is inexact.

173
00:15:57,002 --> 00:15:59,671
- No kidding?
- These landmarks.

174
00:16:01,131 --> 00:16:05,218
- ls this a river?
- No, it's a wavy line.

175
00:16:05,302 --> 00:16:09,054
l didn't draw it. l just transcribed it.
l don't even know if it is a map.

176
00:16:09,138 --> 00:16:11,348
- Let's assume it is.
- What's the axe for?

177
00:16:11,432 --> 00:16:13,434
l don't know yet.

178
00:16:43,336 --> 00:16:46,963
You were the one
that found this plane, yes?

179
00:16:47,047 --> 00:16:49,049
Yeah.

180
00:16:50,091 --> 00:16:52,093
lt was up there.

181
00:16:56,722 --> 00:16:58,724
And what made it fall?

182
00:17:00,309 --> 00:17:02,770
Boone.

183
00:17:02,853 --> 00:17:05,855
Boone made it fall.

184
00:17:05,939 --> 00:17:07,941
Then he died.

185
00:17:09,484 --> 00:17:12,028
Sacrifice that the island demanded.

186
00:17:14,112 --> 00:17:16,114
Excuse me?

187
00:17:17,115 --> 00:17:20,619
Nothing. So, what's next?

188
00:17:20,702 --> 00:17:26,040
We make camp, get some sleep,

189
00:17:26,123 --> 00:17:29,335
and wait for further instruction.

190
00:17:32,630 --> 00:17:34,631
Where in the hell are they?

191
00:17:34,714 --> 00:17:36,800
Just calm down.

192
00:17:36,883 --> 00:17:39,761
Finding his trail in the dark
is not gonna be easy.

193
00:17:39,844 --> 00:17:41,846
They'll be back.

194
00:17:43,973 --> 00:17:45,432
Jack.

195
00:17:45,516 --> 00:17:48,686
She say anything? Libby?

196
00:17:50,020 --> 00:17:52,605
She's still unconscious.

197
00:17:52,689 --> 00:17:54,774
The bleeding's stopped.

198
00:17:54,857 --> 00:17:57,735
- That's good, right?
- No.

199
00:17:59,404 --> 00:18:01,364
lt's not good.

200
00:18:03,740 --> 00:18:08,328
- And there's nothing you can...?
- l can make her comfortable.

201
00:18:08,412 --> 00:18:12,039
But l don't have what l need.

202
00:18:12,123 --> 00:18:14,667
l gave you all the damn meds
two days ago.

203
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:16,460
The heroin, Sawyer.

204
00:18:26,261 --> 00:18:30,639
- Give me twenty minutes.
- Kate's gonna go with you.

205
00:18:30,723 --> 00:18:35,352
- lt doesn't take two people to carry...
- Kate is going with you.

206
00:18:36,437 --> 00:18:38,439
Why would he need me to go with him?

207
00:18:38,522 --> 00:18:43,026
Jacko here knows his heroin's
in my stash with the guns.

208
00:18:43,109 --> 00:18:46,571
So l can either show you where it's at
or let poor Libby suffer.

209
00:18:50,574 --> 00:18:54,703
- That pretty much it, Doc?
- Yeah. Yeah. That's pretty much it.

210
00:19:00,625 --> 00:19:02,460
Let's go, Freckles.

211
00:19:22,436 --> 00:19:25,648
- l'm curious about something.
- Yeah, what's that?

212
00:19:25,731 --> 00:19:28,399
How did Ana Lucia get your gun?

213
00:19:30,318 --> 00:19:33,488
l don't know.
She must have lifted it off me.

214
00:19:33,571 --> 00:19:36,908
She pickpocketed your gun?
How'd she do that?

215
00:19:36,991 --> 00:19:41,328
Well, if l knew how she did it, she
wouldn't be able to do it, would she?

216
00:19:46,333 --> 00:19:47,458
After you.

217
00:19:47,542 --> 00:19:50,169
l thought you were taking me
to your stash.

218
00:19:50,253 --> 00:19:55,341
Do you have to make everything
so damn difficult? Just go in.

219
00:20:14,567 --> 00:20:16,943
You kept the guns here.

220
00:20:17,861 --> 00:20:19,946
All this time, right under you.

221
00:20:20,029 --> 00:20:22,365
Fooled you, didn't l?

222
00:20:29,955 --> 00:20:32,207
Hey, guys.

223
00:20:32,291 --> 00:20:34,960
You seen Libby around?

224
00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:05,320
Eko.

225
00:21:07,197 --> 00:21:08,323
Yemi.

226
00:21:10,533 --> 00:21:12,994
You'll wake John.

227
00:21:14,703 --> 00:21:18,373
Come. Follow me.

228
00:21:25,922 --> 00:21:27,924
Yemi.

229
00:21:48,651 --> 00:21:50,027
Yemi.

230
00:21:55,573 --> 00:21:57,700
Yemi.

231
00:21:58,618 --> 00:22:01,079
Wake up, John.

232
00:22:07,251 --> 00:22:09,127
Are you all right, John?

233
00:22:11,420 --> 00:22:14,131
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, l'm fine.

234
00:22:14,966 --> 00:22:17,510
You had a dream?

235
00:22:19,846 --> 00:22:21,888
Was there a man? A priest?

236
00:22:26,685 --> 00:22:28,895
The man that you saw was my brother.

237
00:22:31,021 --> 00:22:32,064
Your brother?

238
00:22:32,147 --> 00:22:35,317
This is why we needed to come together.

239
00:22:35,401 --> 00:22:38,696
This is how we are going to be led,
how we will know where to go.

240
00:22:38,779 --> 00:22:41,573
- l don't know where to go.
- Did he tell you anything?

241
00:22:41,656 --> 00:22:44,367
- No. He...
- Nothing? Anything?

242
00:22:44,450 --> 00:22:49,122
lt wasn't even me. lt was you.
lt didn't...

243
00:22:50,164 --> 00:22:53,750
He wanted me to follow him.

244
00:22:53,834 --> 00:22:55,836
Follow him where?

245
00:23:07,054 --> 00:23:09,055
Wait here.

246
00:23:10,599 --> 00:23:14,060
Eko, it was just a dream. lt's not safe.

247
00:23:20,649 --> 00:23:21,942
Eko.

248
00:23:35,914 --> 00:23:38,832
Father, it's not a very good time.
Come back later.

249
00:23:38,916 --> 00:23:40,959
l must speak to your daughter.

250
00:23:41,043 --> 00:23:43,462
- Yesterday you said...
- l know what l said.

251
00:23:43,545 --> 00:23:46,215
Just right this minute
it's not a very good time.

252
00:23:46,298 --> 00:23:49,675
All right. Get back in the house, Joyce.
Get her inside.

253
00:23:49,759 --> 00:23:52,512
- Richard, please...
- lnside. Now.

254
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:03,939
l know why you're here, friend,
but save yourself the trouble.

255
00:24:04,022 --> 00:24:06,065
What happened here was not a miracle.

256
00:24:06,148 --> 00:24:09,443
The doctor that treated your daughter
feels differently.

257
00:24:09,527 --> 00:24:12,571
Treated her?
You mean tried to cut her open.

258
00:24:12,655 --> 00:24:14,990
He's trying to cover up
his own negligence.

259
00:24:15,074 --> 00:24:19,285
He tell you the whole story,
how she supposedly drowned?

260
00:24:19,369 --> 00:24:22,205
She fell into a mountain river.
Her body shut down.

261
00:24:22,288 --> 00:24:25,332
She went into hypothermia,
which made her appear dead.

262
00:24:25,415 --> 00:24:28,043
Then why is your wife
so convinced otherwise?

263
00:24:28,126 --> 00:24:31,046
Cos she's a zealot.

264
00:24:31,129 --> 00:24:34,799
All of this, everything she's doing,
it's to spite me.

265
00:24:34,882 --> 00:24:39,595
- Why would she spite you?
- Because she knows l'm a fraud.

266
00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:42,723
Because l make my living as a psychic.

267
00:24:42,807 --> 00:24:48,395
You see, that's what l do. l gather
intelligence on people and l exploit it.

268
00:24:49,229 --> 00:24:53,358
Every day l meet people
looking for a miracle,

269
00:24:53,441 --> 00:24:55,818
desperate to find one.

270
00:24:55,901 --> 00:24:59,655
But there are none to be had.

271
00:24:59,738 --> 00:25:03,075
Not in this world, anyway.

272
00:25:04,784 --> 00:25:09,873
l will report back to my monsignor
that there was no miracle here.

273
00:25:09,956 --> 00:25:13,417
Your daughter is alive.
This is all that matters.

274
00:25:44,028 --> 00:25:47,281
Eko. Be careful.

275
00:25:54,787 --> 00:25:56,289
Eko.

276
00:26:03,128 --> 00:26:04,963
Eko.

277
00:26:05,047 --> 00:26:07,424
l'm fine.

278
00:26:31,445 --> 00:26:35,366
Hey, Eko. What's up there?
Do you see anything?

279
00:26:35,449 --> 00:26:37,451
l don't see nothing.

280
00:27:07,353 --> 00:27:09,104
- lt's salted.
- What?

281
00:27:09,187 --> 00:27:12,983
The earth has been salted
so that nothing can grow.

282
00:27:13,066 --> 00:27:16,695
Why would anyone wanna salt it?
There's nothing here.

283
00:27:16,778 --> 00:27:19,572
l believe they made a circle, a target,

284
00:27:19,655 --> 00:27:22,616
so that this place
can be seen from up above.

285
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:26,412
They? What place?

286
00:27:26,495 --> 00:27:29,497
The place that this plane fell upon,
John. Come on.

287
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:51,642
John.

288
00:27:53,811 --> 00:27:56,146
Will you help me with this?

289
00:28:21,294 --> 00:28:23,296
Wait.

290
00:28:38,476 --> 00:28:40,520
Eko.

291
00:28:40,603 --> 00:28:44,648
- May l?
- Please. Be my guest.

292
00:29:46,537 --> 00:29:49,039
We were gonna have our first date.

293
00:29:52,917 --> 00:29:55,378
Date?

294
00:29:55,462 --> 00:29:57,464
Yeah.

295
00:29:58,047 --> 00:30:00,383
Picnic on the beach.

296
00:30:08,307 --> 00:30:10,516
l'm glad you're OK, man.

297
00:33:11,763 --> 00:33:13,222
John.

298
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:37,911
<i>Hello. I'm Dr Mark Wickmund,</i>

299
00:33:37,994 --> 00:33:42,581
<i>and this is the orientation film
for Station 5 of The Dharma Initiative.</i>

300
00:33:42,665 --> 00:33:46,877
<i>Station 5, or The Pearl,
is a monitoring station</i>

301
00:33:46,961 --> 00:33:50,964
<i>where the activities of participants
in Dharma Initiative projects</i>

302
00:33:51,047 --> 00:33:55,051
<i>can be observed and recorded
not only for posterity,</i>

303
00:33:55,135 --> 00:33:58,680
<i>but for the ongoing refinement
of the Initiative as a whole.</i>

304
00:33:58,763 --> 00:34:01,223
<i>As Karen DeGroot herself has written,</i>

305
00:34:01,306 --> 00:34:06,437
<i>''Careful observation is the only key
to true and complete awareness. ''</i>

306
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:09,314
<i>Your tour of duty in The Pearl
will last three weeks</i>

307
00:34:09,398 --> 00:34:14,694
<i>and during this time you will observe
a psychological experiment in progress.</i>

308
00:34:14,777 --> 00:34:18,656
<i>Your duty is to observe team members
in another station on the island.</i>

309
00:34:18,739 --> 00:34:22,075
<i>These team members are not aware
they are under surveillance</i>

310
00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:24,578
<i>or that they are subjects
of an experiment.</i>

311
00:34:24,661 --> 00:34:28,582
<i>Working in eight-hour shifts,
you and your partner will record</i>

312
00:34:28,665 --> 00:34:33,753
<i>everything you observe
in the notebooks we've provided.</i>

313
00:34:34,545 --> 00:34:37,339
<i>What is the nature of the experiment,
you might ask?</i>

314
00:34:37,423 --> 00:34:40,425
<i>What do these subjects
believe they are accomplishing</i>

315
00:34:40,508 --> 00:34:42,844
<i>as they struggle to fulfil their tasks?</i>

316
00:34:42,927 --> 00:34:45,472
<i>You, as the observer,
don't need to know.</i>

317
00:34:45,555 --> 00:34:48,599
<i>All you need to know
is the subjects believe theirjob</i>

318
00:34:48,682 --> 00:34:50,601
<i>is of the utmost importance.</i>

319
00:34:50,684 --> 00:34:53,896
<i>Remember, everything that occurs,</i>

320
00:34:53,979 --> 00:34:58,816
<i>no matter how minute or seemingly
unimportant, must be recorded.</i>

321
00:34:58,900 --> 00:35:01,903
<i>Each time a notebook is filled</i>

322
00:35:01,986 --> 00:35:05,072
<i>with the fruits
of your diligent observation,</i>

323
00:35:05,156 --> 00:35:09,159
<i>roll it up, and place it
in one of the containers provided.</i>

324
00:35:09,242 --> 00:35:13,205
<i>Then simply place the container
in the pneumatic tube</i>

325
00:35:13,288 --> 00:35:15,832
<i>and presto,</i>

326
00:35:17,124 --> 00:35:19,460
<i>it will be transported directly to us.</i>

327
00:35:19,543 --> 00:35:23,631
<i>At the end of your eight-hour shift,
proceed to the Pala Ferry,</i>

328
00:35:23,714 --> 00:35:27,425
<i>which will take you back to
the barracks to prepare for your next...</i>

329
00:35:27,509 --> 00:35:30,261
<i>On behalf of the DeGroots, Alvar Hanso,</i>

330
00:35:30,345 --> 00:35:33,723
<i>and all of us here
at The Dharma Initiative, thank you.</i>

331
00:35:35,225 --> 00:35:38,894
<i>Namaste and good luck.</i>

332
00:35:51,823 --> 00:35:55,076
Would you like to watch that again?

333
00:35:55,159 --> 00:35:57,744
No.

334
00:35:57,828 --> 00:36:00,205
No, l've seen enough.

335
00:36:08,838 --> 00:36:11,298
What are you doing?

336
00:36:11,382 --> 00:36:13,676
l'm taking this back with us.

337
00:36:15,009 --> 00:36:17,345
Why?

338
00:36:17,429 --> 00:36:20,014
Because they may be important.

339
00:36:20,098 --> 00:36:22,100
lmportant?

340
00:36:23,226 --> 00:36:26,562
l'm sorry. Weren't you just watching
the same thing l was?

341
00:36:26,645 --> 00:36:30,774
Yes, John, and l believe
the work you have been doing

342
00:36:30,858 --> 00:36:32,860
is more important now than ever.

343
00:36:32,943 --> 00:36:35,153
What work?

344
00:36:35,236 --> 00:36:37,238
Pushing the button.

345
00:36:42,785 --> 00:36:48,540
That's not work. That's a joke.

346
00:36:48,623 --> 00:36:52,210
Rats in a maze with no cheese.

347
00:36:52,294 --> 00:36:56,255
lt is work, John. We are being tested.

348
00:36:58,132 --> 00:36:59,592
Tested?

349
00:36:59,675 --> 00:37:02,677
The reason to do it, push the button,

350
00:37:02,761 --> 00:37:05,680
is not because we are told to do so
in a film.

351
00:37:06,973 --> 00:37:13,020
Oh, well.
Well, then, what is the reason, Mr Eko?

352
00:37:13,103 --> 00:37:16,106
We do it
because we believe we are meant to.

353
00:37:17,483 --> 00:37:19,860
lsn't that the reason
you pushed it, John?

354
00:37:23,738 --> 00:37:28,618
l was never meant to do anything.

355
00:37:32,746 --> 00:37:38,585
Every single second
of my pathetic little life

356
00:37:38,668 --> 00:37:41,295
is as useless as that button.

357
00:37:42,546 --> 00:37:45,758
You think it's important?
You think it's necessary?

358
00:37:45,841 --> 00:37:48,177
lt's nothing. lt's nothing.

359
00:37:49,261 --> 00:37:51,554
lt's meaningless.

360
00:37:52,514 --> 00:37:55,350
And who are you
to tell me that it's not?

361
00:37:58,645 --> 00:38:02,231
That's flight 81 5 leaving from gate 23.

362
00:38:02,314 --> 00:38:07,152
<i>- Thank you.
- 840 starting to board at gate 16.</i>

363
00:38:12,156 --> 00:38:14,867
- What are you doing here?
- l had to see you.

364
00:38:14,951 --> 00:38:16,911
- Look, your father said...
- l know.

365
00:38:16,994 --> 00:38:20,872
He doesn't want me talking to you,
and l know you probably think l'm crazy,

366
00:38:20,956 --> 00:38:23,917
but l have a message for you
and l promised to deliver it.

367
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,377
A message?

368
00:38:29,588 --> 00:38:32,591
- He says you were a good priest.
- Who says that?

369
00:38:33,384 --> 00:38:34,427
Yemi.

370
00:38:38,763 --> 00:38:42,976
Speaking about my brother is not a joke,

371
00:38:43,059 --> 00:38:45,687
so you should be very careful
what you say next.

372
00:38:46,688 --> 00:38:52,568
l saw him when l was between places.
He said that you would come and see me.

373
00:38:52,651 --> 00:38:56,155
He said even though you were pretending,
you're a good man.

374
00:38:56,238 --> 00:38:59,323
Who put you up to this?
Did your father tell you to do this?

375
00:38:59,407 --> 00:39:01,242
He will see you soon.

376
00:39:01,325 --> 00:39:05,830
He said that even though you don't have
faith in yourself, he has faith in you.

377
00:39:07,247 --> 00:39:09,875
Why are you doing this to me?
What do you want?

378
00:39:09,958 --> 00:39:16,131
- Why are you doing this to me?
- ls everything... all right?

379
00:39:23,054 --> 00:39:27,140
He has faith in you.
One day you'll believe me.

380
00:39:28,266 --> 00:39:33,688
<i>Oceanic Airlines flight 8 1 5
is now boarding for Los Angeles.</i>

381
00:39:35,190 --> 00:39:37,691
This cross was worn by my brother Yemi.

382
00:39:38,901 --> 00:39:44,406
Yemi was a great man,
a priest, a man of God,

383
00:39:44,490 --> 00:39:47,867
and because l betrayed him,
he was shot and died.

384
00:39:49,660 --> 00:39:52,455
He was placed on a plane

385
00:39:52,538 --> 00:39:54,916
which took off from an airstrip
in Nigeria,

386
00:39:54,999 --> 00:39:57,167
half a world from here.

387
00:40:00,587 --> 00:40:05,383
Then the plane that l was on
crashed on this island.

388
00:40:06,425 --> 00:40:10,888
And somehow, here,
l found my brother again.

389
00:40:10,971 --> 00:40:14,474
l found him in the same plane
that took off from Nigeria,

390
00:40:14,557 --> 00:40:17,102
in the same plane
that lies above us now

391
00:40:17,185 --> 00:40:19,896
that has concealed this place.

392
00:40:21,523 --> 00:40:27,569
And l took this cross from around
Yemi's neck and put it back on mine.

393
00:40:29,154 --> 00:40:34,534
Just as it was on the day
l first took another man's life.

394
00:40:42,417 --> 00:40:45,001
So let me ask you,

395
00:40:45,085 --> 00:40:48,922
how can you say this is meaningless?

396
00:40:53,426 --> 00:40:57,972
l believe the work being done in the
hatch is more important than anything.

397
00:41:01,726 --> 00:41:04,686
lf you will not continue
to push the button, John,...

398
00:41:07,147 --> 00:41:08,314
l will.

399
00:41:42,178 --> 00:41:44,180
Can...

400
00:41:45,347 --> 00:41:47,016
Can l talk to her?

401
00:41:48,976 --> 00:41:50,977
Sure.

402
00:42:12,622 --> 00:42:14,624
Hey.

403
00:42:18,002 --> 00:42:20,003
lt's Hurley.

404
00:42:21,922 --> 00:42:23,006
Hugo.

405
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:36,977
l'm sorry l forgot the blankets.

406
00:42:41,272 --> 00:42:43,608
l'm sorry l forgot the blankets.

407
00:42:51,740 --> 00:42:53,033
Libby?

408
00:43:08,463 --> 00:43:11,633
- Michael.
- Michael.

409
00:43:11,717 --> 00:43:15,637
He's OK. He made it, Libby.
lt's OK. lt's all right.
