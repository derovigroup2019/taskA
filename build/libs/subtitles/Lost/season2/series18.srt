1
00:02:23,156 --> 00:02:25,147
Oh!

2
00:02:38,104 --> 00:02:39,833
How do you feel?

3
00:02:39,906 --> 00:02:41,373
Oh...

4
00:02:41,441 --> 00:02:43,068
I feel free.

5
00:03:03,196 --> 00:03:06,222
They found something. Come on!

6
00:03:06,299 --> 00:03:08,290
Hurry, guys.

7
00:03:23,316 --> 00:03:25,284
Risotto. Nice.

8
00:03:26,353 --> 00:03:27,581
No.

9
00:03:28,555 --> 00:03:31,956
Where did this come from?

10
00:03:32,025 --> 00:03:34,391
Locke said doors trapped him
in the hatch.

11
00:03:34,461 --> 00:03:38,488
Maybe it was because of this,
so no one would see who dropped it.

12
00:03:38,565 --> 00:03:40,499
Any of you guys see a plane last night?

13
00:03:40,567 --> 00:03:44,367
Yeah, I saw it, Tattoo.
I just decided not to tell.

14
00:03:44,437 --> 00:03:46,905
- Give that back.
- I saw it first.

15
00:03:46,973 --> 00:03:48,873
- You saw me take those.
- No.

16
00:03:48,942 --> 00:03:51,342
- Gimme my stuff!
- Hold on, take it easy!

17
00:03:51,411 --> 00:03:53,777
You're like locusts.
How about a little order?

18
00:03:53,847 --> 00:03:56,315
Shouldn't we
let someone trustworthy do this?

19
00:03:56,383 --> 00:03:57,975
Like you, babynapper?

20
00:03:58,051 --> 00:04:02,181
No. Like Hurley. Why not Hurley? He's
done it before, he could do it again.

21
00:04:02,255 --> 00:04:04,018
No! No way!

22
00:04:05,625 --> 00:04:08,719
- Not me! No! Not again! No.
- OK, hey, hey, guys, guys.

23
00:04:08,795 --> 00:04:10,729
How about no one's in charge, OK?

24
00:04:10,797 --> 00:04:13,857
I'm sure everyone can manage
to just take what they need.

25
00:04:13,934 --> 00:04:17,700
Great plan, Moonbeam. After that,
we can sing Kumbaya and do trust falls.

26
00:04:17,771 --> 00:04:21,468
- ... put them in there.
- ... pull this over here.

27
00:04:21,541 --> 00:04:23,099
...savages about it.

28
00:04:23,176 --> 00:04:24,973
We can do it any way you want.

29
00:04:25,045 --> 00:04:26,535
Bacon?

30
00:04:26,613 --> 00:04:29,138
Hey, get your hands off those cookies.

31
00:04:41,995 --> 00:04:43,587
Out of my way.

32
00:05:11,091 --> 00:05:12,456
Hey!

33
00:05:16,262 --> 00:05:18,389
Hey! Hey!

34
00:05:46,192 --> 00:05:47,250
Uh-oh.

35
00:06:09,049 --> 00:06:10,277
Hey.

36
00:06:12,585 --> 00:06:14,576
What you doing?

37
00:06:16,723 --> 00:06:18,122
Nothing.

38
00:06:19,259 --> 00:06:21,523
Who were you looking for up there?

39
00:06:25,598 --> 00:06:26,656
No one.

40
00:06:26,733 --> 00:06:30,430
When you ran off, it sort of seemed
like you were looking for someone.

41
00:06:30,503 --> 00:06:33,233
- I tried to find you...
- I kinda...

42
00:06:34,541 --> 00:06:37,203
don't wanna talk about it.

43
00:06:37,277 --> 00:06:39,142
Sure. OK.

44
00:06:42,515 --> 00:06:44,210
Pretty weird, huh?

45
00:06:45,819 --> 00:06:48,151
You said the island
won't let you lose weight,

46
00:06:48,221 --> 00:06:50,416
you destroy your stash, then bang...

47
00:06:51,224 --> 00:06:53,192
More food falls from the sky.

48
00:06:55,095 --> 00:06:57,222
How about that?

49
00:06:58,264 --> 00:06:59,731
I'm proud of you.

50
00:07:02,168 --> 00:07:06,127
- Proud of me for what?
- Not freaking out.

51
00:07:12,278 --> 00:07:14,269
How's the diet coming, Hugo?

52
00:07:18,885 --> 00:07:20,409
It's OK.

53
00:07:21,654 --> 00:07:24,646
I had a salad and some chicken breast
for lunch.

54
00:07:24,724 --> 00:07:28,182
That's great. It gets easier. I promise.

55
00:07:29,262 --> 00:07:31,924
So,
I heard you had a visit with your mom.

56
00:07:31,998 --> 00:07:34,489
How did that go?

57
00:07:34,567 --> 00:07:37,161
- It was good.
- You're not still mad at her, then?

58
00:07:37,237 --> 00:07:38,727
Nah.

59
00:07:38,805 --> 00:07:41,365
I know she put me in here for a reason.

60
00:07:41,441 --> 00:07:43,432
What reason was that?

61
00:07:46,846 --> 00:07:48,837
The accident.

62
00:07:49,983 --> 00:07:54,545
- You wanna talk about that today?
- Do we have to?

63
00:07:54,621 --> 00:07:57,249
Hugo, you've been in here
almost two months now.

64
00:07:57,323 --> 00:08:01,760
Don't you think it's time
to start getting our hands dirty? Hm?

65
00:08:03,496 --> 00:08:08,524
OK, why don't we talk about the little
homework assignment that I gave you?

66
00:08:09,903 --> 00:08:11,894
I was never really good at homework.

67
00:08:11,971 --> 00:08:14,030
Remember what
you were supposed to do?

68
00:08:14,107 --> 00:08:17,599
Just make a list of things
that you like about yourself?

69
00:08:17,677 --> 00:08:21,545
- Nobody else did it.
- Nobody else? Meaning?

70
00:08:21,614 --> 00:08:25,812
Well, Dave didn't do it.
He said it was a stupid idea.

71
00:08:25,885 --> 00:08:28,251
Well, you know, I'm not Dave's doctor,

72
00:08:28,321 --> 00:08:33,224
but we have talked about
how he can be a very negative influence.

73
00:08:34,194 --> 00:08:37,061
Dave's the most normal person
in this place, man.

74
00:08:37,130 --> 00:08:40,588
But he doesn't want you to change,
does he?

75
00:08:43,636 --> 00:08:47,128
Come on, give me the ball.
Give me the ball! I can play defense.

76
00:08:47,207 --> 00:08:50,836
Dude! Dude, I'm open! Dude! Dude!

77
00:08:50,910 --> 00:08:54,505
It's called "dribbling," not "drooling!"
"Dribbling!"

78
00:08:54,581 --> 00:08:57,209
Well, shoot it, then! Shoot it! What?

79
00:08:57,283 --> 00:09:01,379
High percentage shot.
Excellent choice.

80
00:09:01,454 --> 00:09:03,081
- Shoot!
- Want in the game?

81
00:09:03,156 --> 00:09:06,057
Go for it.
Something tells me no one'll care.

82
00:09:08,261 --> 00:09:10,752
What's the matter with you?

83
00:09:10,830 --> 00:09:12,491
Nothing.

84
00:09:14,834 --> 00:09:17,234
Dude! Dude, give up the rock!

85
00:09:18,438 --> 00:09:22,431
Fantastic. Give it to the guy
who's not even in the game!

86
00:09:24,544 --> 00:09:28,173
Hey, it's Taco Night, dude.
Let's blow this pop stand.

87
00:09:29,282 --> 00:09:34,185
- What?
- Brooks said you're, like, negative.

88
00:09:34,254 --> 00:09:38,350
Well, duh! So, what, you don't
wanna hang out with me any more?

89
00:09:38,424 --> 00:09:42,053
- No, I don't know, it's...
- That quack getting inside your head?

90
00:09:42,128 --> 00:09:45,620
Do not let him. You got much more
important things to think about.

91
00:09:45,698 --> 00:09:49,759
- Like what?
- Like, hard or soft shell, baby?

92
00:09:49,836 --> 00:09:53,567
Chicken or shrimp?
Sour cream or hot sauce?

93
00:09:55,408 --> 00:09:58,138
- Yeah, I guess I could eat.
- Yeah, I thought so.

94
00:09:58,211 --> 00:10:00,611
Noche de Tacos, amigo.

95
00:10:08,454 --> 00:10:10,581
Good. Now, can you do the other one?

96
00:10:17,096 --> 00:10:19,155
- Is it broken?
- Without an X-ray,

97
00:10:19,232 --> 00:10:21,257
you'll have to do with my best guess.

98
00:10:23,236 --> 00:10:24,601
Sorry.

99
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:31,469
- How you holding up?
- Depends on Jack's best guess.

100
00:10:31,544 --> 00:10:35,344
There's a small fracture,
probably hairline.

101
00:10:35,415 --> 00:10:38,009
This will reduce the swelling
until I get a splint.

102
00:10:38,084 --> 00:10:42,350
- How long until I can walk on it?
- Keep off it a couple of weeks.

103
00:10:42,422 --> 00:10:46,722
- There's a wheelchair back at camp...
- No. I don't need a wheelchair.

104
00:10:46,793 --> 00:10:51,730
We took a pair of crutches from the
fuselage when we moved down the beach.

105
00:10:52,365 --> 00:10:53,627
OK.

106
00:10:54,367 --> 00:10:56,301
I'll be back in a while.

107
00:10:59,138 --> 00:11:01,299
He could've escaped.

108
00:11:01,374 --> 00:11:03,399
- Sorry?
- Henry.

109
00:11:04,944 --> 00:11:07,936
During the lockdown. I was hurt.

110
00:11:08,014 --> 00:11:10,881
He could have escaped...

111
00:11:10,950 --> 00:11:14,283
But he came back to help me.
Why would he do that?

112
00:11:14,354 --> 00:11:16,754
He didn't come back to help you, John.

113
00:11:16,823 --> 00:11:21,556
He came back because he thought
his story was gonna check out.

114
00:11:25,465 --> 00:11:27,763
He was dead already.

115
00:11:29,969 --> 00:11:33,996
Four months ago,
I was part of the search party.

116
00:11:34,073 --> 00:11:38,806
Henry Gale was hanging
out of the basket, neck broken.

117
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:42,277
So he was already dead?

118
00:11:43,583 --> 00:11:44,914
Yes.

119
00:11:44,984 --> 00:11:47,646
And then you buried him
and left the grave marker?

120
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:49,278
Yes.

121
00:11:49,989 --> 00:11:53,686
You really should have checked
his wallet before you did that.

122
00:11:56,462 --> 00:12:00,831
I assume Henry Gale did not have any
paper on which to compose his thoughts,

123
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:02,959
so he had to improvise.

124
00:12:03,036 --> 00:12:05,163
There wasn't much space for that.

125
00:12:07,407 --> 00:12:08,806
" Jennifer... "

126
00:12:09,709 --> 00:12:15,670
"Well, you were right. Crossing the
Pacific isn't easy. I owe you a beer. "

127
00:12:15,748 --> 00:12:19,707
"I'm hiking to one of the beaches
to start a signal fire,

128
00:12:19,786 --> 00:12:23,745
but if you're reading this,
I guess I didn't make it. "

129
00:12:23,823 --> 00:12:29,261
"I'm sorry. I love you, Jenny.
Always have, always will. "

130
00:12:31,097 --> 00:12:33,759
"Yours, Henry. "

131
00:12:36,135 --> 00:12:38,535
So tell me...

132
00:12:38,604 --> 00:12:42,802
how did Henry Gale write a note
to his wife with a broken neck?

133
00:12:46,446 --> 00:12:50,849
It wasn't me. I didn't kill him.
You don't understand...

134
00:12:50,917 --> 00:12:54,080
How did you know his wife's name?
Did you interrogate him?

135
00:12:54,153 --> 00:12:58,783
- Please... just listen... I'm just a...
- How many of you are there?

136
00:12:58,858 --> 00:13:02,521
If I tell you about them,
you have no idea what he'll do.

137
00:13:02,595 --> 00:13:04,028
He?

138
00:13:04,097 --> 00:13:07,555
You mean their leader.
The guy with the beard.

139
00:13:07,633 --> 00:13:12,263
- Him? He's no one. Nothing!
- Where are your people?

140
00:13:12,338 --> 00:13:14,704
- I can't...
- How many of you are there?

141
00:13:14,774 --> 00:13:17,538
- You don't understand!
- Understand this!

142
00:13:17,610 --> 00:13:19,202
Hey.

143
00:13:19,278 --> 00:13:23,681
You have three seconds to answer my
question. How many of you are there?

144
00:13:23,749 --> 00:13:25,011
- One.
- He'll kill me!

145
00:13:25,084 --> 00:13:27,245
I'll kill you.

146
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:28,514
- Two.
- Sayid!

147
00:13:28,588 --> 00:13:31,523
You can't do this!
I am not a bad person!

148
00:13:31,591 --> 00:13:32,717
Three.

149
00:13:34,293 --> 00:13:37,091
What the hell's wrong with you?

150
00:13:37,163 --> 00:13:39,791
- What's going on? I heard a shot!
- What happened?

151
00:13:39,866 --> 00:13:43,802
- He's a liar.
- It's fine. Just get him out of here.

152
00:13:43,870 --> 00:13:45,963
Jack!

153
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:49,205
Jack?

154
00:13:52,812 --> 00:13:55,212
- Jack!
- I've got it covered, John.

155
00:14:00,086 --> 00:14:02,748
- Thank you.
- Shut up.

156
00:14:17,436 --> 00:14:19,461
Hey.

157
00:14:19,539 --> 00:14:21,734
I noticed you were building something.

158
00:14:21,807 --> 00:14:26,574
I thought maybe you could use this,
for whatever it is.

159
00:14:26,646 --> 00:14:29,206
That's very thoughtful of you, Charlie.

160
00:14:34,954 --> 00:14:37,013
Why don't you help me?

161
00:14:38,124 --> 00:14:40,092
What are you making?

162
00:14:41,394 --> 00:14:43,294
Hold that end.

163
00:14:47,266 --> 00:14:49,291
Is it a Starbucks?

164
00:14:53,406 --> 00:14:56,000
Help me carry one of those logs, please.

165
00:14:56,075 --> 00:14:57,770
Are you gonna tell me?

166
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:02,777
Not right now.

167
00:15:57,436 --> 00:15:59,529
You're not here!

168
00:16:17,823 --> 00:16:19,415
Hey!

169
00:16:19,492 --> 00:16:23,395
Wait!

170
00:16:23,462 --> 00:16:25,521
Wait! Dave!

171
00:16:41,847 --> 00:16:43,678
You OK, Hurley?

172
00:16:46,886 --> 00:16:49,787
Did either of you see
a guy run through here?

173
00:16:49,855 --> 00:16:51,846
In a bathrobe?

174
00:16:53,859 --> 00:16:55,952
With a coconut?

175
00:16:56,662 --> 00:17:00,564
No. I saw a polar bear
on rollerblades with a mango.

176
00:17:02,301 --> 00:17:04,667
I did not see anything either.

177
00:17:05,905 --> 00:17:08,430
Yeah, me neither.

178
00:17:13,279 --> 00:17:17,079
- 4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42...
- Aw, dude.

179
00:17:17,950 --> 00:17:20,248
Pretty sneaky, Leonard.

180
00:17:22,488 --> 00:17:26,356
Using those magic numbers of yours
as a psych-out, aren't you, man?

181
00:17:27,727 --> 00:17:31,493
Oh, yeah, that's right. You just
play dumb. I'm onto your juju, man.

182
00:17:31,564 --> 00:17:36,001
- They're just numbers, dude.
- What the hell is that?

183
00:17:36,836 --> 00:17:38,667
It's my mid-afternoon snack.

184
00:17:38,738 --> 00:17:41,969
Dude, that's celery.
Celery is not a snack.

185
00:17:43,342 --> 00:17:48,109
Leonard's got graham crackers.
You should snag one. He won't notice.

186
00:17:48,180 --> 00:17:50,774
What's he gonna do? Call you a "23"?

187
00:17:51,751 --> 00:17:56,916
- 4, 8, 15, 16...
- 4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42. Hike!

188
00:17:59,258 --> 00:18:01,818
Hey, Hugo. Here's your meds.

189
00:18:02,528 --> 00:18:04,689
Thank you, Nurse Lazenby.

190
00:18:05,698 --> 00:18:08,326
Dude, you wanna get outta here with me?

191
00:18:08,401 --> 00:18:12,997
- Don't take the horse tranquilizer.
- What do you mean, "get outta here?"

192
00:18:13,072 --> 00:18:16,473
I mean, escape, man. Me and you. ASAP.

193
00:18:16,542 --> 00:18:19,136
They're getting to you, dude.
We gotta split.

194
00:18:19,211 --> 00:18:22,840
- Dr. Brooks says...
- Dr. Brooks does not care about you.

195
00:18:22,915 --> 00:18:25,042
He's the one prescribing that crap.

196
00:18:27,219 --> 00:18:29,016
What the hell is it anyway?

197
00:18:30,055 --> 00:18:33,286
- Clonazepam.
- Hugo.

198
00:18:33,359 --> 00:18:37,420
- Something wrong with your meds, there?
- No.

199
00:18:37,496 --> 00:18:42,195
Me and Dave were just, you know...
talking about stuff.

200
00:18:42,268 --> 00:18:44,930
Right. Well, sorry to interrupt.

201
00:18:45,938 --> 00:18:47,872
Hello there, Dave.

202
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:49,669
Hello there, Dr. Brooks.

203
00:18:49,742 --> 00:18:52,734
- And how are you today?
- Never been saner.

204
00:18:52,812 --> 00:18:57,511
I'm taking pictures for the bulletin
board. I've got everyone except you two.

205
00:18:57,583 --> 00:19:00,017
- Would you guys mind?
- OK.

206
00:19:02,254 --> 00:19:06,213
OK. Why don't you
get a little closer together?

207
00:19:06,292 --> 00:19:09,750
Are you gonna make us
look at the ducky, too?

208
00:19:09,829 --> 00:19:11,194
Say cheese!

209
00:19:11,263 --> 00:19:13,254
- Cheese!
- Queso!

210
00:19:14,767 --> 00:19:18,464
Great. OK, you...
you need a little water with that?

211
00:19:18,537 --> 00:19:20,630
Nope. I'm good.

212
00:19:20,706 --> 00:19:23,402
OK. Well, fine. See you later, guys.

213
00:19:23,476 --> 00:19:25,467
Thanks for the photo op.

214
00:19:26,679 --> 00:19:30,479
8, 15, 16, 23, 42...

215
00:19:30,549 --> 00:19:33,541
- Dude...
- Dude.

216
00:19:33,619 --> 00:19:36,053
The revolution has begun, man.

217
00:19:36,121 --> 00:19:39,386
Lay low. When the time is right, we fly.

218
00:19:51,136 --> 00:19:53,036
You gotta twist it.

219
00:19:54,907 --> 00:19:57,899
To get the frosting.
Pulling it'll only break your cookie.

220
00:19:57,977 --> 00:20:02,311
Well, that's what I get for not going
to the expert in the first place.

221
00:20:02,381 --> 00:20:04,349
What can I do you for, Deep Dish?

222
00:20:06,151 --> 00:20:08,642
I was kind of looking for something.

223
00:20:08,721 --> 00:20:10,313
Forget it. I'm done trading.

224
00:20:10,389 --> 00:20:13,415
I got enough food now
to open a chain of mini-marts.

225
00:20:13,492 --> 00:20:15,323
Hey, you think Sayid needs a job?

226
00:20:15,394 --> 00:20:19,160
Well, actually, I was sort of
hoping you'd do me a favor.

227
00:20:19,231 --> 00:20:22,098
Remember when I helped you out
with that tree frog...

228
00:20:22,167 --> 00:20:24,431
which you killed?

229
00:20:24,503 --> 00:20:26,733
Yeah, I remember.

230
00:20:26,805 --> 00:20:30,297
Well, I sorta... need some medicine.

231
00:20:31,577 --> 00:20:33,442
What do you need?

232
00:20:33,512 --> 00:20:37,573
- It's called Clonazepam.
- Clonaze-what?

233
00:20:37,650 --> 00:20:39,811
What the hell's that?

234
00:20:39,885 --> 00:20:44,447
It's so you can calm down
or for when you're seeing things...

235
00:20:45,925 --> 00:20:48,985
that aren't supposed to be there.

236
00:20:51,397 --> 00:20:53,627
What stuff are you seeing?

237
00:20:55,801 --> 00:20:59,066
I don't know, maybe, like,
a bald guy in a bathrobe.

238
00:21:01,006 --> 00:21:02,997
You mean like that guy there?

239
00:21:07,079 --> 00:21:08,239
Gotcha.

240
00:21:12,017 --> 00:21:15,384
- Think you're funny?
- What are you doing?

241
00:21:15,454 --> 00:21:18,082
- Who do you think you are?
- Get off!

242
00:21:18,157 --> 00:21:21,024
- Let go of me!
- Lambchop!

243
00:21:23,796 --> 00:21:28,665
Pork Pie! Babar! Jabba! Stay-Puft!

244
00:21:31,637 --> 00:21:34,663
- Kong! Deep Dish!
- Let go of me! Get him off me!

245
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:39,973
Get off me! You out of your mind?
What the hell's the matter with you?

246
00:21:40,045 --> 00:21:41,512
Get off me!

247
00:21:46,485 --> 00:21:48,510
What the hell's the matter with you?

248
00:21:50,255 --> 00:21:53,884
- You're crazy!
- I'm not crazy.

249
00:21:57,997 --> 00:22:00,022
I'm not crazy.

250
00:22:02,868 --> 00:22:05,132
So he just attacked you, huh?

251
00:22:08,374 --> 00:22:10,706
Try to contain yourself, Freckles.

252
00:22:10,776 --> 00:22:12,539
What? I'm worried.

253
00:22:12,611 --> 00:22:16,741
- You look like you got your ass kicked.
- Don't you got an adventure to get to?

254
00:22:16,815 --> 00:22:19,511
I think Timmy fell down a well
over that way.

255
00:22:22,621 --> 00:22:26,819
- Why would Hurley of all people...
- I got no idea! I didn't do nothing.

256
00:22:26,892 --> 00:22:29,827
- He just Hulked out on me.
- For no reason at all?

257
00:22:29,895 --> 00:22:31,954
OK.

258
00:22:32,031 --> 00:22:35,000
You walk off
and have yourself a nice long giggle.

259
00:22:35,067 --> 00:22:38,264
But steer clear. The man is crazy.

260
00:22:46,378 --> 00:22:47,845
Hurley?

261
00:22:50,282 --> 00:22:52,273
Hey.

262
00:22:52,351 --> 00:22:56,811
- You OK? What happened with Sawyer?
- I don't wanna talk about it.

263
00:22:56,889 --> 00:23:01,917
- So, you beat him up?
- Guess you know what happened, then.

264
00:23:01,994 --> 00:23:06,954
- I'm on your side. Whatever you...
- Look, I don't wanna talk, OK?

265
00:23:13,605 --> 00:23:15,835
- What?
- That's a lot of peanut butter.

266
00:23:15,908 --> 00:23:18,069
I'll need a lot of protein
where I'm going.

267
00:23:18,143 --> 00:23:20,611
- Where are you going?
- Back to the caves.

268
00:23:20,679 --> 00:23:23,307
No one lives there,
so I won't bother anybody.

269
00:23:23,382 --> 00:23:25,646
I'm gonna live alone
and be one of those guys.

270
00:23:25,718 --> 00:23:29,245
You know, the crazy guys, with a big
beard, no clothes, who's naked

271
00:23:29,321 --> 00:23:32,722
- and throws doody at people.
- Hurley, you don't have to do this.

272
00:23:32,791 --> 00:23:34,486
Just leave me alone.

273
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:38,326
You can't help me. No one can.

274
00:24:31,950 --> 00:24:33,440
You're not here.

275
00:24:39,291 --> 00:24:41,282
You were in the hospital.

276
00:24:42,995 --> 00:24:47,455
- You can't be here.
- Sorry, dude. I am here.

277
00:24:51,703 --> 00:24:55,298
I like that I have a good relationship
with my mom.

278
00:24:55,374 --> 00:24:58,343
I like making my Grandpa Tito laugh.

279
00:24:59,812 --> 00:25:01,677
I like chicken.

280
00:25:03,315 --> 00:25:06,182
No, that last one wasn't about you,
Hugo.

281
00:25:07,286 --> 00:25:09,151
I like that I like chicken?

282
00:25:11,824 --> 00:25:14,588
So tell me,
how did it feel writing that?

283
00:25:14,660 --> 00:25:16,787
Was that difficult?

284
00:25:16,862 --> 00:25:19,126
Kinda.
I think I messed up some spelling.

285
00:25:19,198 --> 00:25:21,928
You didn't say anything
about the way you look.

286
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,696
Are you comfortable
with your appearance?

287
00:25:26,705 --> 00:25:28,366
Well, it's not like...

288
00:25:30,342 --> 00:25:33,106
I mean, I can't really
do anything about it, right?

289
00:25:43,488 --> 00:25:45,080
If I...

290
00:25:47,793 --> 00:25:51,991
If I... wasn't so fat...

291
00:25:57,169 --> 00:25:59,694
they never would have died.

292
00:26:05,744 --> 00:26:10,807
There were 23 people on that deck.
It was built to hold eight.

293
00:26:10,883 --> 00:26:14,250
And it would have collapsed
whether you went out there or not.

294
00:26:14,319 --> 00:26:16,549
Yeah, but I did walk out there.

295
00:26:18,056 --> 00:26:19,921
And it did collapse.

296
00:26:22,995 --> 00:26:25,122
- And I killed them.
- It was an accident.

297
00:26:25,197 --> 00:26:26,994
It was my fault.

298
00:26:27,966 --> 00:26:33,836
Look, after those people died, you were
in a practically catatonic state.

299
00:26:33,906 --> 00:26:38,343
You stopped talking, you stopped
going out, you stopped sleeping.

300
00:26:40,946 --> 00:26:46,543
But you never stopped eating,
because that's how you punish yourself.

301
00:26:50,656 --> 00:26:52,647
Dave's right about you.

302
00:26:53,825 --> 00:26:56,157
You're nothing but a quack.

303
00:26:57,462 --> 00:27:02,627
- Dave doesn't want you to lose weight.
- You know, Dave cares about me.

304
00:27:02,701 --> 00:27:04,692
He's my friend.

305
00:27:07,105 --> 00:27:11,769
I'm gonna show you something,
and it may upset you.

306
00:27:12,344 --> 00:27:17,008
This is the photo
that I took for the bulletin board.

307
00:27:24,856 --> 00:27:27,450
Dave isn't your friend, Hugo...

308
00:27:29,328 --> 00:27:31,922
because Dave doesn't exist.

309
00:27:49,114 --> 00:27:52,106
Psst! Hey! Wake up, dude.

310
00:27:56,688 --> 00:27:59,919
Finally. You could sleep
through a damn NASCAR race, man.

311
00:27:59,992 --> 00:28:02,552
But, you're not... You're...

312
00:28:03,228 --> 00:28:04,820
You're a hallucination.

313
00:28:06,298 --> 00:28:09,233
- Ow!
- Was that a hallucination?

314
00:28:09,301 --> 00:28:11,394
Maybe I just imagined you slapped me.

315
00:28:11,470 --> 00:28:14,530
- Ow! Damn it!
- We can do this all night.

316
00:28:14,606 --> 00:28:17,200
Dr. Brooks showed me
a picture from the rec room,

317
00:28:17,275 --> 00:28:19,175
and my arm was around nothingness.

318
00:28:19,244 --> 00:28:22,680
Uh... Kinko's? Photoshop?

319
00:28:22,748 --> 00:28:24,909
Think they really
blew up the Death Star?

320
00:28:24,983 --> 00:28:27,178
- No.
- Then stop talking crazy, man.

321
00:28:27,252 --> 00:28:29,413
Come on, we're on a clock here.

322
00:28:33,592 --> 00:28:35,355
Hey, you in or you out, dude?

323
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:43,691
OK, come on, come on.

324
00:28:46,271 --> 00:28:49,240
Yo, check it out,
Marcus didn't finish his lasagna.

325
00:28:49,307 --> 00:28:51,832
That is a waste, man. One for the road?

326
00:29:03,555 --> 00:29:06,115
Wait for it. Wait.

327
00:29:15,467 --> 00:29:18,300
Tippytoes, big guy. V?monos!

328
00:29:33,318 --> 00:29:37,880
OK, man, you got the keys, hombre.
You took 'em off Brooks' desk earlier.

329
00:29:42,260 --> 00:29:44,387
Come on, man, open it, open it.

330
00:29:53,905 --> 00:29:56,032
Oh-oh-oh!

331
00:29:57,008 --> 00:29:59,101
Can you taste that?

332
00:29:59,744 --> 00:30:01,575
That is freedom, baby.

333
00:30:03,548 --> 00:30:05,778
Know what tastes
even better than freedom?

334
00:30:05,851 --> 00:30:09,116
Cheeseburgers.

335
00:30:21,066 --> 00:30:24,035
Come on, man! Chili fries on me.

336
00:30:25,837 --> 00:30:27,600
I don't think I can do this.

337
00:30:30,442 --> 00:30:34,572
- I'm sorry.
- Sorry? What, are you kidding me?

338
00:30:34,646 --> 00:30:37,547
You're not real.
You're trying to get me to run away

339
00:30:37,616 --> 00:30:39,481
and get cheeseburgers because...

340
00:30:39,551 --> 00:30:42,213
I want cheeseburgers.

341
00:30:42,287 --> 00:30:46,917
- Did you take those pills, man?
- No, man, I'm just not coming.

342
00:30:46,992 --> 00:30:51,759
- Look, you don't want me to change.
- You don't need to change, man.

343
00:30:51,830 --> 00:30:55,095
- You are fine. You are great.
- No, I'm not.

344
00:30:57,235 --> 00:31:00,796
You just want me to stay fat.
You don't want me to get better.

345
00:31:00,872 --> 00:31:03,466
You wouldn't care
if I ate myself to death.

346
00:31:03,542 --> 00:31:05,635
Do not do this, man.

347
00:31:05,710 --> 00:31:11,649
If you don't come with me right now,
you will never get outta here.

348
00:31:16,254 --> 00:31:18,017
Bye, Dave.

349
00:31:39,077 --> 00:31:42,240
You wouldn't happen to have my slipper,
would you?

350
00:31:52,023 --> 00:31:53,581
Thank you.

351
00:31:55,627 --> 00:31:59,028
Oh, man! You got peanut butter on it.

352
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:07,302
OK, look, I know you're freaking out
right now, and I'm sorry, but...

353
00:32:09,107 --> 00:32:12,133
it's gonna get a little worse
before it gets better.

354
00:32:12,210 --> 00:32:16,408
- Worse?
- Yeah. Kinda.

355
00:32:16,481 --> 00:32:18,415
You ready, dude?

356
00:32:22,153 --> 00:32:26,214
You remember that night
you closed that window on me?

357
00:32:26,291 --> 00:32:28,589
Remember what you did
after that night?

358
00:32:28,660 --> 00:32:30,127
Yeah.

359
00:32:31,096 --> 00:32:34,725
- I realized you were imaginary.
- Mm-hm.

360
00:32:34,799 --> 00:32:38,599
And... that was a breakthrough.

361
00:32:40,405 --> 00:32:42,839
And a little while later,
Brooks let me out,

362
00:32:42,907 --> 00:32:45,535
and I went home to live with my mom,

363
00:32:45,610 --> 00:32:48,044
and I got my job at Mr. Cluck's back,

364
00:32:48,113 --> 00:32:51,048
- and I got better.
- OK. Good. Great. Yeah.

365
00:32:51,116 --> 00:32:54,176
Except, see, here's the thing. Uh...

366
00:32:56,921 --> 00:32:58,752
None of that ever happened.

367
00:33:00,692 --> 00:33:04,719
- What?
- You're still at Santa Rosa, man.

368
00:33:04,796 --> 00:33:07,356
You never left the hospital.

369
00:33:13,204 --> 00:33:17,971
- That's not possible.
- It's hard, I know.

370
00:33:18,043 --> 00:33:21,308
But, I mean, all this?

371
00:33:21,379 --> 00:33:25,372
You? Me? This island?
That peanut butter?

372
00:33:25,450 --> 00:33:27,315
None of it's real, man.

373
00:33:27,385 --> 00:33:29,444
None of it's happening.

374
00:33:29,521 --> 00:33:32,456
It's all in your head, my friend.

375
00:33:32,524 --> 00:33:36,016
The second you closed that window,
your brain popped a gasket.

376
00:33:36,094 --> 00:33:38,062
You went back into your coma thing,

377
00:33:38,129 --> 00:33:41,064
and that's where you are
right this very second.

378
00:33:41,132 --> 00:33:45,228
In your own private Idaho
inside Santa Rosa.

379
00:33:46,037 --> 00:33:47,698
No.

380
00:33:47,772 --> 00:33:49,069
I had...

381
00:33:49,140 --> 00:33:50,607
My mom...

382
00:33:50,675 --> 00:33:52,836
My friend Johnny...

383
00:33:52,911 --> 00:33:56,347
- I won the lottery.
- Whoa! Wow!

384
00:33:56,414 --> 00:33:58,814
Awesome, dude.

385
00:33:58,883 --> 00:34:00,680
What numbers did you play?

386
00:34:03,888 --> 00:34:07,551
Leonard's numbers, right?
From the hospital? What a coincidence.

387
00:34:07,625 --> 00:34:09,820
You seen them around anywhere else?

388
00:34:11,996 --> 00:34:14,829
- The hatch.
- Bingo! The hatch.

389
00:34:14,899 --> 00:34:19,700
With the button that you gotta push
every 108 minutes or the world ends.

390
00:34:19,771 --> 00:34:23,070
Oh, oh, oh,
and what's the code for the button?

391
00:34:23,141 --> 00:34:26,599
Oh, yeah. The numbers.

392
00:34:29,848 --> 00:34:31,941
But I got better.

393
00:34:32,016 --> 00:34:34,883
- I changed.
- Changed? Are you kidding?

394
00:34:34,953 --> 00:34:38,047
You've been on a deserted island
for over two months

395
00:34:38,123 --> 00:34:40,114
and you haven't dropped ten pounds.

396
00:34:40,191 --> 00:34:42,216
How is that even possible, man?

397
00:34:42,293 --> 00:34:45,091
I just destroyed my stash.
And I've been exercising.

398
00:34:45,163 --> 00:34:47,393
- Libby says it won't...
- Right, Libby.

399
00:34:47,465 --> 00:34:48,955
The mega-cute blonde chick

400
00:34:49,033 --> 00:34:52,093
who magically appeared
from the other side of the island.

401
00:34:52,170 --> 00:34:56,334
Oh, yeah, and who just happens
to have the hots for you?

402
00:35:00,311 --> 00:35:02,506
Come on, man. Let's take a walk.

403
00:35:07,085 --> 00:35:10,851
- So this is all in my brain?
- Every rock. Every tree.

404
00:35:10,922 --> 00:35:15,916
Every tree frog. Even me. The real me,
the one they told you was imaginary?

405
00:35:15,994 --> 00:35:17,791
He went out that window, man.

406
00:35:17,862 --> 00:35:21,195
Right now, he's probably bouncing
from hot chick to hot chick.

407
00:35:21,266 --> 00:35:24,030
Unlike me, who's really you,

408
00:35:24,102 --> 00:35:26,161
who's got more important things to do.

409
00:35:27,439 --> 00:35:30,408
- So I'm making you up?
- Well, sorta.

410
00:35:30,475 --> 00:35:33,000
I'm part of your subconscious, man.

411
00:35:33,077 --> 00:35:35,602
All the people on this island are.

412
00:35:36,681 --> 00:35:38,774
What part of me are you?

413
00:35:39,818 --> 00:35:43,015
I'm the part of you
that wants to wake up, man.

414
00:35:44,756 --> 00:35:46,451
Follow me.

415
00:35:52,831 --> 00:35:54,822
This is it, dude.

416
00:35:56,234 --> 00:35:58,759
- It?
- The big finale.

417
00:35:59,504 --> 00:36:01,597
The answer to all your problems.

418
00:36:02,707 --> 00:36:05,141
A way for you to wake up,
snap out of it.

419
00:36:10,715 --> 00:36:12,273
I don't wanna kill myself.

420
00:36:12,350 --> 00:36:14,978
Who said anything
about killing yourself, man?

421
00:36:15,053 --> 00:36:17,248
This is gonna bring you back to life.

422
00:36:20,859 --> 00:36:22,724
The only way for you to bust out

423
00:36:22,794 --> 00:36:27,288
is to tell your mind
that you don't believe any of this.

424
00:36:28,700 --> 00:36:30,292
So...

425
00:36:31,069 --> 00:36:32,969
if I...

426
00:36:35,206 --> 00:36:39,074
All this will be gone?
I'll just wake up?

427
00:36:39,143 --> 00:36:40,633
That's right.

428
00:36:42,380 --> 00:36:45,816
And when you do wake up, come find me.

429
00:36:46,784 --> 00:36:48,945
I'm sure I miss you.

430
00:36:51,523 --> 00:36:53,582
See you in another life, Hurley.

431
00:36:55,226 --> 00:36:56,853
Dave!

432
00:37:15,647 --> 00:37:17,706
Jack not back yet?

433
00:37:17,782 --> 00:37:22,310
Nope. He's telling everyone at the beach
that we've got one of 'em.

434
00:37:22,387 --> 00:37:26,289
Something tells me people have
a lot of questions about our houseguest.

435
00:37:26,357 --> 00:37:27,824
I want to talk to him.

436
00:37:27,892 --> 00:37:30,884
I don't think that's on today's program.

437
00:37:30,962 --> 00:37:34,659
Well, all due respect, Ana Lucia,
but I don't care what you think.

438
00:37:37,302 --> 00:37:39,236
Five minutes.

439
00:37:41,039 --> 00:37:43,667
I earned five minutes with him.

440
00:38:03,461 --> 00:38:05,520
What's your name?

441
00:38:07,231 --> 00:38:08,721
Your real name.

442
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:12,497
Why don't you
just keep calling me Henry?

443
00:38:15,173 --> 00:38:17,232
I've gotten used to it.

444
00:38:21,012 --> 00:38:23,344
Did you get caught on purpose?

445
00:38:24,649 --> 00:38:28,050
You and your people have been here
for God knows how long,

446
00:38:28,119 --> 00:38:31,714
- and you got caught in a net...
- God doesn't know.

447
00:38:31,789 --> 00:38:33,620
Excuse me?

448
00:38:36,394 --> 00:38:39,693
God doesn't know
how long we've been here, John.

449
00:38:40,698 --> 00:38:45,601
He can't see this island any better
than the rest of the world can.

450
00:38:45,670 --> 00:38:47,729
May I ask you a question?

451
00:38:49,941 --> 00:38:55,277
What possible reason could I have
for putting myself through all this?

452
00:38:55,346 --> 00:38:59,305
Maybe your people
were looking for this place.

453
00:38:59,384 --> 00:39:00,976
This place?

454
00:39:02,854 --> 00:39:06,517
This place is a joke, John.

455
00:39:07,692 --> 00:39:10,286
What are you talking about?

456
00:39:10,361 --> 00:39:12,261
I crawled through your vents

457
00:39:12,330 --> 00:39:16,790
and I stood at your computer
as the alarm beeped.

458
00:39:16,868 --> 00:39:18,802
And you know what happened?

459
00:39:20,471 --> 00:39:23,201
The timer went all the way down to zero.

460
00:39:24,642 --> 00:39:28,442
And then some funny red pictures
flipped up in its place.

461
00:39:28,513 --> 00:39:32,950
They looked like hieroglyphics,
but I'm no expert.

462
00:39:33,785 --> 00:39:35,719
Then things got real interesting.

463
00:39:35,787 --> 00:39:39,348
There was a loud... clunking

464
00:39:39,424 --> 00:39:44,452
and a hum like a... magnet,
a big magnet.

465
00:39:44,529 --> 00:39:46,793
It was really very frightening.

466
00:39:49,267 --> 00:39:51,428
And do you know what happened next?

467
00:39:53,604 --> 00:39:55,936
Nothing happened, John.

468
00:39:57,608 --> 00:39:59,473
Nothing happened at all.

469
00:39:59,544 --> 00:40:03,344
Your timer just flipped back to 108.

470
00:40:07,518 --> 00:40:09,509
I never entered the numbers.

471
00:40:10,121 --> 00:40:12,112
I never pressed the button.

472
00:40:19,363 --> 00:40:20,830
You're lying.

473
00:40:24,435 --> 00:40:26,403
No, I'm done lying.

474
00:40:38,416 --> 00:40:39,906
Dave!

475
00:40:42,386 --> 00:40:43,978
Who's Dave?

476
00:40:45,189 --> 00:40:49,091
- What are you doing here?
- What are you doing here?

477
00:40:49,160 --> 00:40:51,788
How did you know where I was?

478
00:40:51,863 --> 00:40:56,823
- Jin saw you while he was fishing.
- Ha! Jin doesn't speak English.

479
00:40:56,901 --> 00:41:01,838
Sun was with him. She translated.
Hurley, what is going on?

480
00:41:01,906 --> 00:41:04,875
No! You're just the part of me
that's scared.

481
00:41:07,311 --> 00:41:09,472
You don't want me to wake up.

482
00:41:09,547 --> 00:41:11,913
Well, guess what? I'm not scared.

483
00:41:13,684 --> 00:41:18,417
OK, Hurley,
you're having some sort of panic attack.

484
00:41:18,489 --> 00:41:20,116
I get that.

485
00:41:21,092 --> 00:41:26,655
- But this isn't like you.
- Like me? You don't know me.

486
00:41:26,731 --> 00:41:28,392
I was starting to.

487
00:41:28,466 --> 00:41:32,459
Yeah, well, did you know I'm so fat
that I killed two people?

488
00:41:32,537 --> 00:41:34,596
And that I have an imaginary friend?

489
00:41:34,672 --> 00:41:37,732
Hurley, please.
You're gonna hurt yourself.

490
00:41:37,809 --> 00:41:41,711
No, I'm not!
Because this isn't happening.

491
00:41:41,779 --> 00:41:44,043
None of it. I'm just imagining it.

492
00:41:44,115 --> 00:41:45,912
This isn't real life.

493
00:41:45,983 --> 00:41:48,315
Why would you say that?

494
00:41:48,386 --> 00:41:50,377
Because in real life...

495
00:41:54,892 --> 00:41:57,190
no girl like you would ever like me.

496
00:42:01,799 --> 00:42:04,791
You remember when I said
I knew you from somewhere?

497
00:42:06,838 --> 00:42:09,170
Well, maybe it's 'cause I made you up.

498
00:42:16,314 --> 00:42:19,147
What was the man's name
who broke his leg?

499
00:42:21,385 --> 00:42:24,149
The day of the crash.
On the other side of the island,

500
00:42:24,222 --> 00:42:27,157
Eko brought a man
with a broken leg to me for help.

501
00:42:27,225 --> 00:42:29,159
What was his name?

502
00:42:29,827 --> 00:42:31,624
I don't know.

503
00:42:32,496 --> 00:42:34,487
You don't know. You know why?

504
00:42:35,333 --> 00:42:37,426
Because it happened to me.

505
00:42:40,972 --> 00:42:44,669
His name was Donald, and I buried him.

506
00:42:44,742 --> 00:42:47,370
I buried a lot of people, Hurley.

507
00:42:47,445 --> 00:42:49,777
So don't tell me that
that wasn't real.

508
00:42:52,283 --> 00:42:56,083
And don't tell me you made me up.

509
00:42:57,755 --> 00:42:59,689
It's insulting.

510
00:43:05,263 --> 00:43:10,064
When you saw me on the beach
this morning, was I holding a slipper?

511
00:43:11,135 --> 00:43:14,730
No, not that I can remember, no.

512
00:43:18,042 --> 00:43:19,634
Hurley...

513
00:43:22,179 --> 00:43:23,908
look at me.

514
00:43:25,950 --> 00:43:28,214
I am real.

515
00:43:30,187 --> 00:43:32,246
You're real.

516
00:43:33,457 --> 00:43:38,019
The way I feel about you, that's real.

517
00:43:57,315 --> 00:44:00,842
And that was real.

518
00:44:06,424 --> 00:44:08,483
Maybe you should do it one more time.

519
00:44:09,560 --> 00:44:11,118
Just to be sure.

520
00:44:20,571 --> 00:44:22,698
Ready to go back?

521
00:44:36,787 --> 00:44:41,622
Do you really think I can,
you know, change?

522
00:44:42,893 --> 00:44:44,292
Yeah.

523
00:44:45,830 --> 00:44:47,320
Yeah, I do.

524
00:44:53,971 --> 00:44:56,701
Why don't you
get a little closer together?

525
00:44:59,777 --> 00:45:01,608
- Say cheese!
- Cheese!

526
00:45:03,114 --> 00:45:04,945
Great.

527
00:45:05,016 --> 00:45:06,916
You need some water to go with that?

528
00:45:06,984 --> 00:45:09,475
- Nope, I'm good.
- OK. Well, fine.

529
00:45:09,553 --> 00:45:12,283
See you later, guys.
Thanks for the photo op.

530
00:45:14,892 --> 00:45:16,917
Here's your pill, Libby.
