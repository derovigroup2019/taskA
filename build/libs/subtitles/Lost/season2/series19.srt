00:00:00,434 --> 00:00:01,867
previously on lost

2
00:00:01,900 --> 00:00:05,434
right here, there's a line.

3
00:00:05,468 --> 00:00:06,934
You cross that line,

4
00:00:06,967 --> 00:00:09,767
we go from misunderstanding

5
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:11,633
to... something else.

6
00:00:11,667 --> 00:00:12,800
What do i do?

7
00:00:12,834 --> 00:00:14,700
the button must be pushed

8
00:00:20,468 --> 00:00:22,733
i never entered the numbers

9
00:00:22,767 --> 00:00:25,101
i never pushed the button

10
00:00:25,134 --> 00:00:26,767
you're lying

11
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:28,934
No, i'm done lying.

12
00:00:28,967 --> 00:00:31,434
it's a parachute

13
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:50,800
All right. Cereal goes
on the left, bernard.

14
00:00:53,167 --> 00:00:55,134
So this isn't
bothering you at all?

15
00:00:55,167 --> 00:00:56,468
What's "this"?

16
00:00:56,501 --> 00:00:58,334
Well, this.

17
00:00:58,367 --> 00:01:00,234
This.

18
00:01:00,267 --> 00:01:02,767
Why is a bag of potato chips
gonna bother me?
Well, aren't you

19
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:05,501
remotely curious as to
where all this came from?

20
00:01:05,534 --> 00:01:08,101
You're acting like we just
got back from the supermarket.

21
00:01:08,134 --> 00:01:12,000
Well, i guess i was raised
never to question my blessings.

22
00:01:12,034 --> 00:01:15,034
(chuckles) i was raised
to question piles of food

23
00:01:15,067 --> 00:01:18,034
with weird labels that just
fall out of the sky, rose.

24
00:01:18,067 --> 00:01:20,967
Well, honey, just because
you're having a bad day,

25
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
doesn't mean you have
to raise your voice.

26
00:01:23,034 --> 00:01:24,900
Bad day? I've had
seven weeks of bad days

27
00:01:24,934 --> 00:01:27,867
on the other side of the island,
just trying to stay alive

28
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:29,867
so i could get back to you.
But here...

29
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:34,568
my god, rose, they've built
a kitchen on the beach.

30
00:01:35,667 --> 00:01:37,267
They've given up.

31
00:01:37,301 --> 00:01:40,101
Given up? On what?

32
00:01:40,134 --> 00:01:42,434
On getting rescued.

33
00:02:19,201 --> 00:02:20,501
Hey.

34
00:02:20,534 --> 00:02:23,800
You gonna get that?

35
00:02:41,367 --> 00:02:44,767
When's the last time
you went in to see him?

36
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:47,401
A couple hours ago.
He was sleeping.

37
00:02:47,434 --> 00:02:49,101
Did he eat?

38
00:02:49,134 --> 00:02:51,167
Nope.

39
00:02:51,201 --> 00:02:53,334
That's two days now.

40
00:02:53,367 --> 00:02:55,434
No food, no water...

41
00:02:55,468 --> 00:02:58,067
nothing to say.

42
00:02:58,101 --> 00:02:59,967
I don't know about you,

43
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,367
but i'm tired
of waiting.

44
00:03:16,633 --> 00:03:19,867
I hear you've lost
your appetite.

45
00:03:22,468 --> 00:03:25,568
Okay, don't talk.

46
00:03:25,633 --> 00:03:29,733
(chuckles) i was never that good
at bedside manner anyway.

47
00:03:29,767 --> 00:03:32,234
I'm gonna change that dressing
on your shoulder.

48
00:03:32,267 --> 00:03:35,434
If you try anything,
we've got a problem.

49
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,501
So, henry...

50
00:03:50,534 --> 00:03:53,834
(chuckles) "henry."

51
00:03:53,867 --> 00:03:57,000
I was thinking about
something you were saying

52
00:03:57,034 --> 00:03:59,767
before we found out
who you are.

53
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:02,733
This is gonna sting.

54
00:04:05,101 --> 00:04:06,568
Yeah. You were saying

55
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:08,767
<i>that if you were
one of them,</i>

56
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:12,600
that you'd lead us
into a trap...

57
00:04:12,633 --> 00:04:14,633
capture our people...

58
00:04:14,667 --> 00:04:16,834
force a trade.

59
00:04:16,867 --> 00:04:18,367
Us, for you.

60
00:04:20,201 --> 00:04:21,834
Pretty good idea, henry.

61
00:04:21,867 --> 00:04:26,034
<i>And since
you are one of them,</i>

62
00:04:26,067 --> 00:04:29,134
i thought now might be
a good time to use it.

63
00:04:29,167 --> 00:04:32,867
I'm going out to the line that
we're not supposed to cross

64
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:35,234
and telling them
that we've got you.

65
00:04:35,267 --> 00:04:39,167
And if they want you back,
it'll cost 'em.

66
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,367
(sighs)

67
00:04:43,401 --> 00:04:45,401
And when we get walt back...

68
00:04:48,201 --> 00:04:50,967
you might just have been worth
all the trouble.

69
00:04:55,134 --> 00:04:57,600
Did you say something?

70
00:05:01,367 --> 00:05:04,301
They'll never give you walt.

Don't gun it.

You're digging yourself in.

76
00:05:34,687 --> 00:05:37,454
Just tap the gas lightly.
All due respect,

77
00:05:37,487 --> 00:05:39,487
i have been driving in snow
my whole life.

78
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:41,520
You mind stepping back?
Well, you have
to rock it out.

79
00:05:41,554 --> 00:05:44,287
You're not
gonna be able to...

80
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:46,821
(engine continues revving)

81
00:05:46,854 --> 00:05:49,987
I'm calling triple "a."

82
00:05:50,021 --> 00:05:51,754
Why, so they can send
a tow truck?

83
00:05:51,787 --> 00:05:53,654
Trust me, i can do this.

84
00:05:59,821 --> 00:06:01,921
Okay. Ease on the gas.

85
00:06:03,088 --> 00:06:05,687
That's it.
You're doing great.

86
00:06:07,188 --> 00:06:09,721
Almost.

87
00:06:09,754 --> 00:06:12,320
Go, go, go... oh!

88
00:06:12,353 --> 00:06:13,654
(rose) aah!

89
00:06:15,554 --> 00:06:17,220
Are you... are you okay?

90
00:06:17,253 --> 00:06:21,487
Oh, yeah. Sure.
I'm fine.

91
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:25,387
You know, i would have
gotten it out eventually.

92
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:28,821
Oh, sure.
July's right around the corner.

93
00:06:28,854 --> 00:06:31,253
(both chuckling)

94
00:06:31,287 --> 00:06:34,754
Well, um,
thanks for helping me.

95
00:06:34,787 --> 00:06:36,654
Sure.

96
00:06:36,687 --> 00:06:39,088
By the way, i'm rose.

97
00:06:39,121 --> 00:06:40,587
Oh, uh, bernard.

98
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:43,220
Yeah.

99
00:06:43,253 --> 00:06:45,287
Okay.

100
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:46,921
Oh. Okay. Yeah.

101
00:06:46,954 --> 00:06:49,021
(clears throat) okay.

102
00:06:50,921 --> 00:06:55,587
Whew.
Drive, uh,
drive safe, now, okay?

103
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:58,188
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
You, too.

104
00:07:05,387 --> 00:07:08,454
Um... uh, bernard!

105
00:07:08,487 --> 00:07:10,754
Yeah?

106
00:07:10,787 --> 00:07:15,253
Can i buy you
a cup of coffee?

107
00:07:17,921 --> 00:07:20,454
Uh, coffee would be ni.

108
00:07:20,487 --> 00:07:24,220
Yeah. Okay.

109
00:07:29,787 --> 00:07:32,654
I had to beat back
half the group to get these.

110
00:07:32,687 --> 00:07:34,353
I saved 'em for you.

111
00:07:34,387 --> 00:07:36,220
No way.
I'm on a new diet.

112
00:07:36,253 --> 00:07:38,088
Nothing but fish
and water...

113
00:07:38,121 --> 00:07:41,654
and... fish and water.

114
00:07:41,687 --> 00:07:43,487
Hurley, what are you
doing right now?

115
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:45,487
Uh... talking to your wife?

116
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:47,654
Good. Can you get libby
and meet me

117
00:07:47,687 --> 00:07:49,620
at the edge of the tree line
in five minutes?

118
00:07:49,654 --> 00:07:52,454
Oh, and if you can get
jin and sun, jenkins

119
00:07:52,487 --> 00:07:54,287
and that frogurt guy, the guy
who used to make frozen yogurt.

120
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:56,121
Neil?
Yeah. And craig

121
00:07:56,154 --> 00:07:57,821
and anybody else
you can get.

122
00:07:57,854 --> 00:08:00,420
Bernard,
what are you up to?

123
00:08:00,454 --> 00:08:02,420
I got an idea.

124
00:08:02,454 --> 00:08:06,154
Hey, richard. Craig, ralph, come
here. I've got a great idea.

125
00:08:09,454 --> 00:08:12,420
I'm not so sure
trading people's their thing.

126
00:08:12,454 --> 00:08:14,921
Well, talking to him
is getting us nowhere.

127
00:08:14,954 --> 00:08:17,987
So, maybe we can get
something for him.

128
00:08:18,021 --> 00:08:20,487
You want me to come
with you?

129
00:08:23,387 --> 00:08:25,121
You need to stay here.

130
00:08:30,054 --> 00:08:32,587
You need it more than i do.

131
00:08:35,121 --> 00:08:38,121
Do yourself a favor, man.
(gun clicks)

132
00:08:38,154 --> 00:08:40,054
Don't go out there alone.

133
00:08:40,088 --> 00:08:42,420
All rit.

134
00:08:44,654 --> 00:08:46,454
Ha ha.
That's how it's done.

135
00:08:46,487 --> 00:08:48,554
Oh, well look at you.

136
00:08:48,587 --> 00:08:51,787
What, that's, like,
four in the last half hour?

137
00:08:51,821 --> 00:08:55,121
Let me call the guinness book.
You wanna help or not?

138
00:08:55,154 --> 00:08:57,887
'Cause i got better things
to do with my time.

139
00:08:57,921 --> 00:09:00,554
Oh, happy day.

140
00:09:00,587 --> 00:09:03,520
Here comes dr. Giggles.

141
00:09:03,554 --> 00:09:05,121
Hey.

142
00:09:05,154 --> 00:09:06,554
Hey yourself.

143
00:09:06,587 --> 00:09:09,287
I'm going back out
into the jungle

144
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:11,188
to talk to our friend
with the beard.

145
00:09:11,253 --> 00:09:12,821
See if we can make a trade.

146
00:09:12,854 --> 00:09:17,154
Ah, the old prisoner exchange.

147
00:09:17,188 --> 00:09:19,721
And you're inviting me along
'cause you want a gun, huh?

148
00:09:19,754 --> 00:09:23,253
I'm not inviting you.
I'm inviting kate.

149
00:09:23,287 --> 00:09:25,921
And i've already got a gun,
but thanks for offering.

150
00:09:25,954 --> 00:09:27,320
How in the hell
did you get a gun?

151
00:09:27,353 --> 00:09:29,520
(chuckles)
Does it matter?

152
00:09:33,287 --> 00:09:35,887
I'll get my things.

153
00:09:40,021 --> 00:09:42,420
Okay. Two months we've been
on this island, right?

154
00:09:42,454 --> 00:09:43,487
Two months.

155
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:45,754
And... and already
we have a water trough,

156
00:09:45,787 --> 00:09:48,687
and we've got
a-a-a food pantry,

157
00:09:48,721 --> 00:09:53,620
<i>and people are taking showers
in your... hatch.</i>

158
00:09:53,654 --> 00:09:57,554
Have you forgotten that we all
crashed on this island?

159
00:09:57,587 --> 00:09:59,721
It's like none of you
want to go home again.

160
00:09:59,754 --> 00:10:01,854
How can you say that?
Of course we want to go home.

161
00:10:01,887 --> 00:10:03,721
Then why aren't we doing
anything about it?

162
00:10:03,754 --> 00:10:06,987
Dude, we, like,
built a raft...

163
00:10:07,021 --> 00:10:08,987
that got blown up.

164
00:10:09,021 --> 00:10:10,487
Okay.

165
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:12,687
So what
are we doing now?

166
00:10:12,721 --> 00:10:15,854
That pallet of food
had a parachute,

167
00:10:15,887 --> 00:10:17,887
which means
a plane dropped it here,

168
00:10:17,921 --> 00:10:21,188
which means that there are other
planes that fly over the island.

169
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:23,787
So, we are gonna build a sign.

170
00:10:23,821 --> 00:10:27,420
A massive sign
along the beach.

171
00:10:27,454 --> 00:10:29,387
So that way,
if a plane flies over,

172
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:32,587
or a satellite takes pictures
from up there,

173
00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:34,687
we want to make damn sure

174
00:10:34,721 --> 00:10:36,721
that they know we're here,

175
00:10:36,754 --> 00:10:38,721
that they know about us.

176
00:10:38,754 --> 00:10:42,787
Maybe we should speak
to jack about this first.

177
00:10:42,821 --> 00:10:46,821
Well, do we have to run
everything by jack?

178
00:10:46,854 --> 00:10:48,721
I mean, he's not the president.

179
00:10:48,754 --> 00:10:51,320
He's... he's a doctor.

180
00:10:51,353 --> 00:10:53,154
You're a dentist.

181
00:10:56,854 --> 00:11:00,620
Ahem. Uh, could l-i speak to you
for just a second?

182
00:11:00,654 --> 00:11:03,088
Come on.

183
00:11:05,088 --> 00:11:08,854
Honey, it is just a sign.
I don't see what the harm is.

184
00:11:08,887 --> 00:11:12,021
The harm is, you are telling
these people about airplanes

185
00:11:12,054 --> 00:11:15,287
and satellites coming out
of nowhere to save the day.

186
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:17,287
<i>I'm just trying
to do something.</i>

187
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:19,188
I want to get back
to our life.

188
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:21,188
Well, the only thing
you are doing

189
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:23,887
is giving these people
false hope.

190
00:11:32,854 --> 00:11:35,487
Excuse me.

191
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:37,754
I have a sign to build.

192
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:40,987
Ahem. All right.

193
00:11:41,021 --> 00:11:44,154
Um, uh, i wanna get
this going right away.

194
00:11:44,188 --> 00:11:45,821
We've waited long enough.

195
00:11:51,970 --> 00:11:55,337
It's just amazing,
isn't it?

196
00:11:55,371 --> 00:11:58,337
Oh, sure, it's beautiful.

197
00:11:58,371 --> 00:11:59,903
You're not impressed, hu

198
00:11:59,937 --> 00:12:02,204
oh, yeah.

199
00:12:02,237 --> 00:12:07,304
So, what does god have to do
to get your attention?

200
00:12:07,337 --> 00:12:08,770
Bernard...

201
00:12:08,803 --> 00:12:11,504
what are you doing?

202
00:12:11,537 --> 00:12:14,537
(playing frank sinatra's
"the right girl for me")

203
00:12:20,937 --> 00:12:24,404
Rose...

204
00:12:24,437 --> 00:12:27,504
i've been a bachelor
for 56 years.

205
00:12:27,537 --> 00:12:30,304
And then i met you,

206
00:12:30,337 --> 00:12:34,371
and... we just fell
into this rhythm

207
00:12:34,404 --> 00:12:37,170
like we had known ch other
forever.

208
00:12:37,204 --> 00:12:40,903
I had always dreamed
of finding somebody like you,

209
00:12:40,937 --> 00:12:43,437
but i'd given up hope
that i ever would.

210
00:12:43,471 --> 00:12:44,604
Bernard...

211
00:12:44,638 --> 00:12:46,738
oh, i know, i know.
It's crazy.

212
00:12:46,770 --> 00:12:51,970
Uh, we just met
five months ago.

213
00:12:52,004 --> 00:12:55,371
But five months
is long enough.

214
00:12:55,404 --> 00:12:59,671
Because i knew
after five minutes.

215
00:13:02,638 --> 00:13:04,638
Rose...

216
00:13:06,004 --> 00:13:08,004
i love you.

217
00:13:09,770 --> 00:13:11,537
Will you marry me?

218
00:13:16,837 --> 00:13:19,870
Bernard, i'm dying.

219
00:13:24,738 --> 00:13:28,671
I'm sick, and i'm dying.

220
00:13:33,170 --> 00:13:36,371
Uh, would you excuse us
for a minute, please?

221
00:13:49,204 --> 00:13:53,404
I've been in remission
for the last couple of years.

222
00:13:53,437 --> 00:13:55,537
But now, it's back,

223
00:13:55,571 --> 00:13:58,604
and this time,
it's not going away.

224
00:13:58,638 --> 00:14:03,638
My doctor says
i have about a year,

225
00:14:03,671 --> 00:14:06,437
maybe a little longer.

226
00:14:22,371 --> 00:14:25,937
You haven't answered
my question.

227
00:14:25,970 --> 00:14:29,571
Are... you sure?

228
00:14:35,337 --> 00:14:37,337
Oh, i'm sure.

229
00:14:44,704 --> 00:14:46,937
Yes...

230
00:14:46,970 --> 00:14:49,304
yes.

231
00:14:56,237 --> 00:14:58,704
Well, you bunk with a guy
for 48 days,

232
00:14:58,738 --> 00:15:00,704
now he doesn't call
or write.

233
00:15:00,738 --> 00:15:02,837
Hello, bernard.

234
00:15:02,870 --> 00:15:05,404
What do you boys
got going up here?

235
00:15:05,437 --> 00:15:06,770
Just working.

236
00:15:06,803 --> 00:15:09,537
Well, listen.
I've got a whole team of folks

237
00:15:09,571 --> 00:15:12,204
throwing together a big sign
down along the beach.

238
00:15:12,237 --> 00:15:15,137
Hopefully, it'll get us spotted
by a plane or a satellite.

239
00:15:15,170 --> 00:15:17,237
We could sure use
all the bodies we could get

240
00:15:17,271 --> 00:15:20,170
to help put it together.
Sorry, i'm busy.

241
00:15:20,204 --> 00:15:22,671
Charlie?

242
00:15:22,704 --> 00:15:25,970
Ah, regrets, bernard. I've only
got two hands, you know.

243
00:15:26,004 --> 00:15:27,504
Good luck, though.

244
00:15:30,371 --> 00:15:32,671
Well, could i at least grab
some of these logs?

245
00:15:32,704 --> 00:15:34,604
We could sure use...
we're using them.

246
00:15:34,638 --> 00:15:36,770
For what, exactly?

247
00:15:36,803 --> 00:15:38,337
A church.

248
00:15:38,371 --> 00:15:42,004
A church?

249
00:15:42,037 --> 00:15:43,604
Yes.

250
00:15:43,638 --> 00:15:46,537
Everybody on this island
is building something.

251
00:15:46,571 --> 00:15:49,437
I'm trying to get us saved.

252
00:15:49,471 --> 00:15:53,170
People are saved
in different ways, bernard.

253
00:15:54,437 --> 00:15:56,404
I think i liked you better

254
00:15:56,437 --> 00:15:58,837
when you just hit people
with your stick.

255
00:16:02,903 --> 00:16:06,304
I like you
just the way you are.

256
00:16:36,604 --> 00:16:38,604
I need to talk to him.

257
00:16:38,638 --> 00:16:42,304
The gun's with jack.
The door stays closed.

258
00:16:43,571 --> 00:16:47,271
But if you wanna talk to him,
talk to him.

259
00:17:01,504 --> 00:17:03,504
Henry, can you hear me?

260
00:17:07,337 --> 00:17:09,304
It's john, henry.

261
00:17:17,337 --> 00:17:21,070
Henry, did you enter
the numbers?

262
00:17:22,970 --> 00:17:26,604
Did you push the button
or not?

263
00:17:26,638 --> 00:17:28,337
Henry!

264
00:17:28,371 --> 00:17:32,604
I need to know.
I want you to answer me.

265
00:17:32,638 --> 00:17:34,571
Answer me!

266
00:17:36,004 --> 00:17:37,903
Henry, can you hear me?!

267
00:17:49,956 --> 00:17:51,756
What happened to everybody?

268
00:17:51,789 --> 00:17:54,390
Where's, uh,
where's craig?

269
00:17:54,423 --> 00:17:55,789
Where's frogurt?

270
00:17:57,023 --> 00:17:58,989
Okay. All right.
Moving on.

271
00:17:59,023 --> 00:18:01,756
We're gonna put the sign
across this entire beach,

272
00:18:01,789 --> 00:18:05,023
which means the letters
have to be really big...

273
00:18:05,056 --> 00:18:07,056
about 40 feet.

274
00:18:07,089 --> 00:18:10,922
These black rocks will get
maximum contrast with the sand.

275
00:18:10,956 --> 00:18:14,356
Dude, we're likely
to need a lot more rocks.

276
00:18:14,390 --> 00:18:15,589
Yes, hurley.

277
00:18:15,622 --> 00:18:18,056
We are gonna need
a lot more rocks.

278
00:18:18,089 --> 00:18:20,589
There's a lava field
about a half a mile inland.

279
00:18:20,622 --> 00:18:21,922
It's just loaded with them.

280
00:18:21,956 --> 00:18:23,922
We're gonna haul them out
in 2-man teams.

281
00:18:23,956 --> 00:18:25,889
So, uh, you guys double up,

282
00:18:25,922 --> 00:18:28,989
and i am gonna start sketching
off the letters in the sand.

283
00:18:29,023 --> 00:18:30,722
Let's do this.

284
00:18:30,756 --> 00:18:33,189
Hey, um, i can sketch
the letters.

285
00:18:33,223 --> 00:18:34,622
Everybody's got a job,
hurley.

286
00:18:34,655 --> 00:18:37,756
I do my job,
you do yours.

287
00:18:37,789 --> 00:18:40,289
(speaking korean)

288
00:18:40,323 --> 00:18:42,722
What? What'd he say?
I think he's not so crazy

289
00:18:42,756 --> 00:18:45,555
about the whole "carry the rocks
a half mile" thing.

290
00:18:45,589 --> 00:18:48,223
Okay... well,
this is gonna take time.

291
00:18:48,256 --> 00:18:50,956
But if this is the thing
that gets us off this plac

292
00:18:50,989 --> 00:18:53,256
isn't that worth it?

293
00:18:53,289 --> 00:18:56,256
Rome wasn't built in a day,
you know.

294
00:18:56,289 --> 00:18:58,023
Ah, no, you don't... okay.

295
00:18:58,056 --> 00:19:01,356
All right, let's get started.
Come on.

296
00:19:03,856 --> 00:19:06,922
We're lost.
Oh, you saying we're lost

297
00:19:06,956 --> 00:19:08,555
doesn't make us lost,
sweetheart.

298
00:19:08,589 --> 00:19:10,756
I know exactly
where we are.

299
00:19:10,789 --> 00:19:12,522
Me, too.

300
00:19:12,555 --> 00:19:15,956
Driving around in circles
in the middle of the outback.

301
00:19:15,989 --> 00:19:19,289
(laughs)
That's why i wand
to be on a beach

302
00:19:19,323 --> 00:19:21,522
for our honeymoon.

303
00:19:21,555 --> 00:19:26,123
Thank goodness.
Civilization.

304
00:19:26,156 --> 00:19:27,956
Bernard,
let's get directions.

305
00:19:27,989 --> 00:19:29,956
Oh, i don't need directions.

306
00:19:29,989 --> 00:19:32,189
I told you, honey.
We're not lost.

307
00:19:32,223 --> 00:19:36,989
Bernard, what's going on?

308
00:19:37,023 --> 00:19:40,156
I brought you out here...

309
00:19:40,189 --> 00:19:43,423
because i want you
to see this man.

310
00:19:43,456 --> 00:19:46,622
His name is isaac of uluru

311
00:19:46,655 --> 00:19:48,722
and he's helped
hundreds of people.

312
00:19:48,756 --> 00:19:50,722
Now, i know how it looks,

313
00:19:50,756 --> 00:19:53,223
but believe me,
he is completely legit.

314
00:19:53,256 --> 00:19:55,423
Bernard...

315
00:19:55,456 --> 00:19:59,423
you brought me
to a faith healer?

316
00:20:04,156 --> 00:20:05,722
He's the real deal, rose.

317
00:20:05,756 --> 00:20:09,456
Once i started telling people
about your situation,

318
00:20:09,490 --> 00:20:11,390
i got three separate calls
recommending him.

319
00:20:11,423 --> 00:20:12,922
My situation?

320
00:20:14,390 --> 00:20:17,689
This is why you wanted
to come to australia?

321
00:20:17,722 --> 00:20:20,922
To bring me
to some kind of a kook?

322
00:20:20,956 --> 00:20:22,456
No, he's not.

323
00:20:22,490 --> 00:20:25,856
Rose, i made a $10,000 donation
just to get you in to see him.

324
00:20:25,889 --> 00:20:29,323
Normally...
i didn't ask for this!

325
00:20:36,856 --> 00:20:39,123
It's just...

326
00:20:43,323 --> 00:20:45,789
bernard...

327
00:20:45,822 --> 00:20:47,956
i have made my peace

328
00:20:47,989 --> 00:20:51,655
with what's happening
to me.

329
00:20:54,223 --> 00:20:56,156
Well, i haven't.

330
00:20:57,822 --> 00:21:01,456
I can't just do nothing,
rose.

331
00:21:01,490 --> 00:21:05,123
That's not me.
That's not who i am.

332
00:21:05,156 --> 00:21:07,156
I have to try.

333
00:21:09,722 --> 00:21:12,189
Will you try, rose?

334
00:21:14,490 --> 00:21:18,089
For me.

335
00:21:23,289 --> 00:21:25,256
(bernard) okay,
it's just gonna be great.

336
00:21:25,289 --> 00:21:27,289
It's gonna be a really big sign.
(sawyer) that's great.

337
00:21:27,323 --> 00:21:29,490
If you have time
to fix your hut,

338
00:21:29,522 --> 00:21:32,223
you'll have time
to move some rocks.

339
00:21:32,256 --> 00:21:34,722
Come on. We could
really use your help.

340
00:21:34,756 --> 00:21:36,789
What, you got union trouble

341
00:21:36,822 --> 00:21:39,256
down at the sand factory,
norma rae?

342
00:21:40,822 --> 00:21:43,256
Come on, sawyer.
I need your help.

343
00:21:43,289 --> 00:21:45,390
Now what do you say?

344
00:21:45,423 --> 00:21:48,189
(sighs) i say...

345
00:21:48,223 --> 00:21:50,490
pas-adena.

346
00:22:04,555 --> 00:22:05,789
Well, i hope you're happy.

347
00:22:05,822 --> 00:22:08,789
About what?
This morning i had 15 people

348
00:22:08,822 --> 00:22:11,789
willing to work on the sign,
and now i'm down to four.

349
00:22:11,822 --> 00:22:13,756
And how is that my fault?

350
00:22:13,789 --> 00:22:16,756
(sighs) at the very least,
i expected your support.

351
00:22:16,789 --> 00:22:18,922
You had to go
and attack me.

352
00:22:18,956 --> 00:22:20,856
Have you ever stopped
to think,

353
00:22:20,889 --> 00:22:22,856
maybe the reason
people are quitting

354
00:22:22,889 --> 00:22:25,789
is because you've got yourself
a management problem?

355
00:22:28,189 --> 00:22:31,056
What is the matter with you,
rose?

356
00:22:31,089 --> 00:22:32,956
I am just trying
to do something.

357
00:22:32,989 --> 00:22:35,522
That's exactly right.
You're always trying to do.

358
00:22:35,555 --> 00:22:38,822
Why can't you
just let things be?

359
00:22:39,889 --> 00:22:42,023
If i didn't
always have to do something,

360
00:22:42,056 --> 00:22:44,289
you wouldn't be here.

361
00:23:10,056 --> 00:23:12,889
I'm flattered.

362
00:23:12,922 --> 00:23:14,589
Yeah? Why is that?

363
00:23:14,622 --> 00:23:18,089
'Cause you chose me to go
with you instead of sawyer.

364
00:23:18,123 --> 00:23:20,356
I asked sayid first, but...

365
00:23:20,390 --> 00:23:23,223
he turned me down.

366
00:23:23,256 --> 00:23:26,023
And i only asked you
because they don't want you.

367
00:23:26,056 --> 00:23:29,323
They grabbed you,
had you at gunpoint.

368
00:23:29,356 --> 00:23:31,390
They could have kept you,
but they didn't.

369
00:23:31,423 --> 00:23:34,289
Then again, they didn't
really want me, either.

370
00:23:34,323 --> 00:23:37,722
Damaged goods.

371
00:23:37,756 --> 00:23:39,522
Both of us.

372
00:23:51,822 --> 00:23:54,756
What's that?

373
00:23:58,989 --> 00:24:00,289
Kate.

374
00:24:02,189 --> 00:24:03,655
It's a doll.

375
00:24:03,689 --> 00:24:06,889
Wait, wait, no...

376
00:24:06,922 --> 00:24:08,423
no, don't...

377
00:24:13,989 --> 00:24:17,889
sorry.

378
00:24:22,623 --> 00:24:23,890
You okay?

379
00:24:23,923 --> 00:24:25,623
Yeah.

380
00:24:25,656 --> 00:24:27,723
<i>Oh, good.
So you can hear me.</i>

381
00:24:30,189 --> 00:24:32,089
This isn't one of theirs.
(grunts)

382
00:24:34,523 --> 00:24:36,523
Must be one
of rousseau's traps.

383
00:24:36,556 --> 00:24:38,523
Hopefully she's not
far from here.

384
00:24:38,556 --> 00:24:40,823
Could be a week
before she shows up.

385
00:24:42,656 --> 00:24:44,322
What are you doing?

386
00:24:44,356 --> 00:24:46,523
I'm trying
to get the gun.

387
00:24:46,556 --> 00:24:49,155
I can't get my arm around.
All right, here, let me.

388
00:24:50,890 --> 00:24:54,289
All right. Hey!

389
00:24:54,322 --> 00:24:57,289
(grunting)
Sorry.

390
00:24:57,322 --> 00:25:00,856
I don't wanna shoot you.

391
00:25:00,890 --> 00:25:02,422
Okay.

392
00:25:02,456 --> 00:25:04,256
You got it?

393
00:25:04,289 --> 00:25:05,456
Okay, ready?
Yeah.

394
00:25:05,489 --> 00:25:07,623
Got it, got it, got it.
Oh, all right.

395
00:25:07,656 --> 00:25:10,289
There, got it.

396
00:25:10,322 --> 00:25:13,122
Now, give me the gun.
Why, what for?

397
00:25:13,155 --> 00:25:15,155
Gonna try to shoot
the rope.

398
00:25:19,222 --> 00:25:21,556
Whoa, whoa, hey, hey, hey!
I'm a better shot
than you are.

399
00:25:21,589 --> 00:25:24,389
(laughs) oh, really?
Yeah, i told you.

400
00:25:24,422 --> 00:25:27,723
I grew up hunting
with my dad.

401
00:25:32,656 --> 00:25:33,623
Damn it!

402
00:25:33,656 --> 00:25:35,623
Well, at least
they know where we are.

403
00:25:35,656 --> 00:25:37,356
Okay, now give me
the gun.

404
00:25:37,389 --> 00:25:39,689
And you're gonna waste
another bullet?

405
00:25:39,723 --> 00:25:41,589
Don't worry.
We'll still have 13 more

406
00:25:41,623 --> 00:25:43,389
to shoot each other with.
Come on.

407
00:25:43,422 --> 00:25:44,489
Fine.

408
00:25:44,523 --> 00:25:46,489
You have a better angle
than i do, anyway.

409
00:25:46,523 --> 00:25:49,356
Oh, that's gonna be your excuse
when i make the shot.

410
00:25:49,389 --> 00:25:51,990
<i>When you make
the shot.</i>

411
00:25:55,689 --> 00:25:57,523
Okay.

412
00:26:08,456 --> 00:26:10,523
Nice shot.
(laughs)

413
00:26:13,055 --> 00:26:14,689
No!

414
00:26:14,723 --> 00:26:17,356
No, no, no, no, no!
You're doing it all wrong!

415
00:26:17,389 --> 00:26:19,923
<i>I told you three rows.</i>

416
00:26:19,956 --> 00:26:23,723
<i>Three... so they can see it
from the air.</i>

417
00:26:23,756 --> 00:26:25,890
(speaking korean)

418
00:26:25,923 --> 00:26:28,923
Three rows!
How hard is that?

419
00:26:32,389 --> 00:26:35,389
(groans) do i just
have to do everything myself?

420
00:26:38,422 --> 00:26:40,155
No! No, no, no!

421
00:26:40,189 --> 00:26:41,756
No, jin. No, wait.

422
00:26:41,789 --> 00:26:43,789
Please...

423
00:26:45,356 --> 00:26:50,389
i just want
to get my wife home.

424
00:26:50,422 --> 00:26:54,022
Rose.

425
00:26:54,055 --> 00:26:57,256
I wanna get rose home.

426
00:27:01,356 --> 00:27:03,356
Sorry.

427
00:27:20,022 --> 00:27:21,556
You're in my spot.

428
00:27:25,656 --> 00:27:27,623
I can move.

429
00:27:27,656 --> 00:27:30,789
Can you?

430
00:27:30,823 --> 00:27:32,990
Oh, that's funny.
(laughs)

431
00:27:33,022 --> 00:27:35,990
I guess your sense of humor
got trapped

432
00:27:36,022 --> 00:27:38,089
under that door with your leg.

433
00:27:41,122 --> 00:27:43,589
I saw your husband
walking through the jungle,

434
00:27:43,623 --> 00:27:45,756
hauling rocks.

435
00:27:47,689 --> 00:27:50,823
He's building a big sign
in the sand,

436
00:27:50,856 --> 00:27:53,122
so the satellites
will see it.

437
00:27:55,656 --> 00:27:57,623
That man doesn't know
the difference

438
00:27:57,656 --> 00:27:59,656
between an errand
and a fool's errand.

439
00:28:02,789 --> 00:28:04,789
Well, rose,
most of us don't.

440
00:28:06,222 --> 00:28:08,356
So what are you doing
down here, john?

441
00:28:08,389 --> 00:28:10,356
Can't remember
the last time

442
00:28:10,389 --> 00:28:12,556
i saw you
out of that hatch.

443
00:28:14,189 --> 00:28:16,256
I'm done with the hatch.

444
00:28:16,289 --> 00:28:18,256
Oh, now,
you're just frustrated.

445
00:28:18,289 --> 00:28:20,256
You'll be out of that splint

446
00:28:20,289 --> 00:28:23,623
and running around the island
again in no time.

447
00:28:23,656 --> 00:28:25,623
Hmm. And yet jack said

448
00:28:25,656 --> 00:28:28,556
it'd be
at least four weeks.

449
00:28:28,589 --> 00:28:31,623
But, honey,
you and i both know

450
00:28:31,656 --> 00:28:35,256
it's not gonna
take that long.

451
00:28:51,689 --> 00:28:53,189
(woman) right this way,
rose.

452
00:28:57,122 --> 00:28:59,389
Please, make yourself
comfortable.

453
00:28:59,422 --> 00:29:01,422
Isaac will be
right with you.

454
00:29:26,122 --> 00:29:28,422
You must be rose.

455
00:29:28,456 --> 00:29:31,155
Why don't you have a seat?

456
00:29:36,155 --> 00:29:40,256
So, um...
how does this work?

457
00:29:40,289 --> 00:29:42,523
I sit here and you chant?

458
00:29:42,556 --> 00:29:44,222
Or, um...

459
00:29:44,256 --> 00:29:46,723
pray or what?

460
00:29:46,756 --> 00:29:49,389
There are certain places
with great energy...

461
00:29:49,422 --> 00:29:53,256
spots on the earth,
like the one we're above now.

462
00:29:53,289 --> 00:29:58,956
Perhaps this energy
is geological, magnetic.

463
00:29:58,990 --> 00:30:02,055
Or perhaps
it's something else.

464
00:30:02,089 --> 00:30:04,923
And, when possible,

465
00:30:04,956 --> 00:30:07,556
i harness this energy

466
00:30:07,589 --> 00:30:10,122
and give it to others.

467
00:30:10,155 --> 00:30:12,155
May i?

468
00:30:32,823 --> 00:30:34,890
What?

469
00:30:34,923 --> 00:30:37,189
What... what is it?

470
00:30:38,890 --> 00:30:41,556
I'm sorry.

471
00:30:43,689 --> 00:30:46,456
Can't do anything
for you, rose.

472
00:30:49,456 --> 00:30:51,856
I didn't expect you to.

473
00:30:58,789 --> 00:31:02,089
It's not that
you can't be healed.

474
00:31:02,122 --> 00:31:03,189
Like i said,

475
00:31:03,222 --> 00:31:07,022
there's different energies.

476
00:31:07,055 --> 00:31:10,556
This is not
the right place for you.

477
00:31:10,589 --> 00:31:13,422
Where is the right place?

478
00:31:13,456 --> 00:31:16,856
I wish i knew.

479
00:31:16,890 --> 00:31:19,789
I'll return
your husband's donation.

480
00:31:19,823 --> 00:31:21,823
Don't.

481
00:31:24,656 --> 00:31:27,723
I'm gonna tell him
you fixed me.

482
00:31:33,189 --> 00:31:36,856
I'm going to tell him
you fixed me.

483
00:31:50,089 --> 00:31:52,990
What did you mean
back there?

484
00:31:53,022 --> 00:31:54,990
What?

485
00:31:55,022 --> 00:31:56,689
In the net.

486
00:31:56,723 --> 00:31:58,956
You said they were
sophisticated, the others.

487
00:32:00,456 --> 00:32:02,422
Uh...

488
00:32:02,456 --> 00:32:06,523
uh, last week,
when the baby got sick,

489
00:32:06,556 --> 00:32:09,089
claire and i went
into the jungle

490
00:32:09,122 --> 00:32:11,589
and, uh,
found another hatch.

491
00:32:11,623 --> 00:32:13,089
What?

492
00:32:13,122 --> 00:32:14,956
Like a medical station.

493
00:32:14,990 --> 00:32:18,689
There was nothing you could use.
It was all cleared out, but...

494
00:32:18,723 --> 00:32:20,789
i found some lockers.

495
00:32:20,823 --> 00:32:23,890
They had clothes inside,
all worn and dirty.

496
00:32:23,923 --> 00:32:27,422
They were on hangers, like...
like costumes, you know?

497
00:32:27,456 --> 00:32:30,356
And there was a makeup kit...

498
00:32:31,789 --> 00:32:33,289
and a fake beard.

499
00:32:35,523 --> 00:32:37,289
When were you going
to tell me this?

500
00:32:37,322 --> 00:32:40,789
When you decided to let me
back in the club.

501
00:32:43,189 --> 00:32:45,155
What?

502
00:32:45,189 --> 00:32:46,956
You can keep one of them
locked up

503
00:32:46,990 --> 00:32:49,756
in the hatch for, like, a week,
and say nothing.

504
00:32:49,789 --> 00:32:52,089
But then, when l...

505
00:32:54,489 --> 00:32:57,456
we're here.

506
00:32:57,489 --> 00:32:58,990
Are you sure? I...

507
00:32:59,022 --> 00:33:02,489
that's where they took
the shot at sawyer.

508
00:33:02,523 --> 00:33:04,789
Right over there
is where they pushed you

509
00:33:04,823 --> 00:33:07,289
out of the jungle
with a bag on your head.

510
00:33:07,322 --> 00:33:10,189
And right there is where i...

511
00:33:10,222 --> 00:33:12,222
where i laid my gun down.

512
00:33:18,856 --> 00:33:20,856
(shouting) hey!

513
00:33:22,723 --> 00:33:26,389
Hey, i'm back!

514
00:33:26,422 --> 00:33:29,823
You say you're watching us?

515
00:33:29,856 --> 00:33:31,723
Do you hear me?!

516
00:33:31,756 --> 00:33:34,389
We've got your man!

517
00:33:34,422 --> 00:33:36,189
If you want him back,

518
00:33:36,222 --> 00:33:38,289
you're gonna
have to come out here!

519
00:33:40,756 --> 00:33:42,189
Come on out!

520
00:33:42,222 --> 00:33:43,322
Jack!

521
00:33:43,356 --> 00:33:45,890
I know you're out there!
I know you can hear me!

522
00:33:45,923 --> 00:33:48,222
Jack, they're not here.

523
00:33:48,256 --> 00:33:51,256
I'll be right here
until you talk to me!

524
00:33:53,422 --> 00:33:57,122
I'll be right here!

525
00:34:10,706 --> 00:34:12,739
i brought you some supper.

526
00:34:14,806 --> 00:34:17,239
Thanks. You can just
set it down there.

527
00:34:23,305 --> 00:34:24,739
Where is everybody?

528
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:33,806
I owe you an apology.

529
00:34:33,839 --> 00:34:36,305
You don't have anything
to be sorry for.

530
00:34:36,339 --> 00:34:39,073
It's my own damn fault
i'm out here by myself.

531
00:34:39,106 --> 00:34:42,140
That's not why
i'm apologizing.

532
00:34:43,606 --> 00:34:45,906
I lied to you.

533
00:34:47,239 --> 00:34:49,272
Back in australia.

534
00:34:49,305 --> 00:34:51,906
Isaac... he didn't heal me.

535
00:34:53,906 --> 00:34:56,472
He didn't do anything.

536
00:34:58,339 --> 00:35:00,339
Of course he did.

537
00:35:00,372 --> 00:35:01,439
You're... you're...

538
00:35:01,472 --> 00:35:05,339
bernard...
he didn't heal me.

539
00:35:05,372 --> 00:35:09,539
But that doesn't mean
i'm not healed.

540
00:35:12,172 --> 00:35:15,305
<i>(rose) when you're sick,
and you've got</i>

541
00:35:15,339 --> 00:35:18,272
<i>something inside you
that doesn't belong there,</i>

542
00:35:18,305 --> 00:35:20,472
<i>you can feel it.</i>

543
00:35:22,572 --> 00:35:27,806
<i>I couldn't feel it anymore.</i>

544
00:35:27,839 --> 00:35:33,339
<i>At first, i thought
it was just shock.</i>

545
00:35:33,372 --> 00:35:36,606
But it wasn't.

546
00:35:36,639 --> 00:35:40,472
It's this place.

547
00:35:43,606 --> 00:35:45,906
But... but you said
isaac fixed you.

548
00:35:45,939 --> 00:35:47,406
I told you that

549
00:35:47,439 --> 00:35:50,606
so that you wouldn't spend
what time we had left

550
00:35:50,639 --> 00:35:54,239
<i>trying to do something.</i>

551
00:35:57,906 --> 00:36:00,339
Uh... rose, you could just
be in remission.

552
00:36:00,372 --> 00:36:03,739
How do you know
it wasn't isaac who healed you?
Bernard...

553
00:36:03,773 --> 00:36:06,939
how do you know
that he didn't heal you?
I know.

554
00:36:09,073 --> 00:36:11,572
I know.

555
00:36:26,439 --> 00:36:27,839
These yours?

556
00:36:27,873 --> 00:36:31,040
Uh, thank you.

557
00:36:33,472 --> 00:36:35,305
You're welcome.

558
00:36:40,472 --> 00:36:42,406
Trust me.

559
00:36:42,439 --> 00:36:45,939
I know.

560
00:36:52,906 --> 00:36:55,906
You don't want
to be rescued, do you?

561
00:36:58,806 --> 00:37:01,239
You think if you leave...

562
00:37:01,272 --> 00:37:04,272
it'll come back.

563
00:37:07,372 --> 00:37:09,406
And if you can't leave...

564
00:37:11,272 --> 00:37:14,706
neither can i.

565
00:37:18,606 --> 00:37:21,706
We won't ever leave, rose.

566
00:37:34,439 --> 00:37:36,172
I would, uh,

567
00:37:36,205 --> 00:37:40,305
i would offer to take down
the sign, but, um...

568
00:37:40,339 --> 00:37:43,572
we didn't get very far.

569
00:38:09,539 --> 00:38:11,572
hey.

570
00:38:11,606 --> 00:38:13,639
Hi.

571
00:38:16,006 --> 00:38:18,172
I pressed yourutton.

572
00:38:19,939 --> 00:38:22,140
It's not my butt.

573
00:38:24,639 --> 00:38:26,239
Where'd you go?

574
00:38:28,539 --> 00:38:31,773
I just needed to...

575
00:38:31,806 --> 00:38:34,140
stretch my legs.

576
00:40:40,673 --> 00:40:42,739
how long are you
gonna wait, jack?

577
00:40:44,839 --> 00:40:47,406
Till i get my voice back.

578
00:40:47,439 --> 00:40:49,572
Then i'm gonna yellsome more.

579
00:40:54,873 --> 00:40:56,806
Maybe they can't hear you.

580
00:40:58,873 --> 00:41:00,406
They can hear me.

581
00:41:07,106 --> 00:41:10,106
I'm sorry i kissed you.

582
00:41:19,406 --> 00:41:21,040
I'm not.

583
00:42:03,272 --> 00:42:04,673
