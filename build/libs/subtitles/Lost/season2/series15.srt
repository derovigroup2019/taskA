<i>Previously on Lost:</i>

2
00:00:04,791 --> 00:00:07,836
We were together for only one week.

3
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:10,130
They came.

4
00:00:11,216 --> 00:00:13,760
They came and took her.

5
00:00:15,553 --> 00:00:17,388
Alex.

6
00:00:18,723 --> 00:00:20,433
They took my baby.

7
00:00:26,065 --> 00:00:28,859
Somebody please help me!

8
00:00:28,943 --> 00:00:32,196
He had this... this thing,
like... like a needle!

9
00:00:32,279 --> 00:00:34,949
He stabbed me with it!

10
00:00:35,032 --> 00:00:36,867
He was trying to hurt my baby!

11
00:00:37,868 --> 00:00:41,665
We got a problem. The manifest.
The names of everyone who survived.

12
00:00:41,748 --> 00:00:44,960
l interviewed everyone.
One of them isn't in the manifest.

13
00:00:45,043 --> 00:00:46,086
Hello there.

14
00:00:47,462 --> 00:00:49,256
Ethan.

15
00:00:53,510 --> 00:00:56,597
- l think they've been taken.
- Claire!

16
00:01:04,272 --> 00:01:08,651
l don't remember Ethan.
l don't remember what he did to me.

17
00:01:08,734 --> 00:01:10,444
Help me!

18
00:01:10,528 --> 00:01:14,157
Don't believe a word he says.
He's one of them.

19
00:01:14,241 --> 00:01:17,286
l have no idea what she's talking about.

20
00:01:17,369 --> 00:01:19,496
For a long time, he will lie.

21
00:01:20,372 --> 00:01:23,959
l don't know why you're asking me
these questions. This is a mistake.

22
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:26,963
Tell me who you are!

23
00:01:27,046 --> 00:01:30,717
- What if he's telling the truth, John?
- What if he's not?

24
00:01:35,930 --> 00:01:37,724
Hey.

25
00:01:41,687 --> 00:01:43,689
Hey, it's OK, sweetie.

26
00:01:50,738 --> 00:01:52,740
Sweetie, it's all right.

27
00:01:56,578 --> 00:02:01,333
- John! John. Wake up.
- What... Claire? What?

28
00:02:01,416 --> 00:02:05,253
He's burning up,
and he's got a rash and...

29
00:02:05,337 --> 00:02:06,922
l need to find Jack.

30
00:02:07,005 --> 00:02:09,424
He's... He's on shift at the hatch.

31
00:02:11,886 --> 00:02:14,555
- OK.
- Uh. No, Claire, wait.

32
00:02:14,639 --> 00:02:17,892
- Claire, wait!
- No, l can't, John. The baby...

33
00:02:17,975 --> 00:02:22,230
No, no, you're not walking through
the jungle in the middle of the night.

34
00:02:22,313 --> 00:02:25,608
l'll go get Jack.
l'll send him right back here.

35
00:02:25,691 --> 00:02:27,736
- OK.
- Don't worry.

36
00:02:38,372 --> 00:02:40,040
Jack.

37
00:02:41,793 --> 00:02:44,629
- What's going on?
- The baby's got a fever.

38
00:02:46,214 --> 00:02:48,675
- A fever?
- Claire was coming here.

39
00:02:52,512 --> 00:02:55,515
- He asleep?
- Not a sound all night.

40
00:02:57,810 --> 00:03:00,145
l'll get back here as soon as l can.

41
00:03:15,203 --> 00:03:17,872
Hey, hey, sweetie.

42
00:03:17,956 --> 00:03:21,126
lt's OK, it's OK.
Mummy's just gonna cool you down, OK?

43
00:03:21,209 --> 00:03:23,837
OK? Shh. lt's OK.

44
00:03:25,088 --> 00:03:27,008
Jack?

45
00:03:28,801 --> 00:03:30,636
What are you doing here?

46
00:03:31,804 --> 00:03:35,808
- You stay away from us.
- He's infected, isn't he?

47
00:03:36,642 --> 00:03:38,144
What?

48
00:03:39,145 --> 00:03:44,693
- Your child. He's sick.
- Just get away. You get away from us!

49
00:03:47,195 --> 00:03:49,197
You don't remember, do you?

50
00:03:54,244 --> 00:03:57,916
lt's a vaccine,
we don't want him to get sick.

51
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:03,463
Hey, get back! Get away from her!
What do you think you're doing here?

52
00:04:03,546 --> 00:04:05,965
What are you doing here?

53
00:04:06,049 --> 00:04:08,051
Just get out of our camp!

54
00:04:16,310 --> 00:04:18,187
What happened?

55
00:04:20,564 --> 00:04:22,775
What did she say?

56
00:04:24,902 --> 00:04:27,489
She said there's
something wrong with him.

57
00:04:48,261 --> 00:04:51,973
lt's just not like him.
He always sleeps through the night.

58
00:04:52,056 --> 00:04:54,725
- This rash... Something's wrong.
- Babies get sick.

59
00:04:54,809 --> 00:04:57,396
- What about the fever, cough...
- lt's normal.

60
00:04:57,479 --> 00:05:00,607
- And he hasn't been eating at all...
- Claire. He's OK.

61
00:05:00,691 --> 00:05:02,276
lt's probably roseola.

62
00:05:02,359 --> 00:05:04,987
lt's a virus
that's common in children his age.

63
00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:08,865
- And the rash is a sign of it.
- OK. What if it's not?

64
00:05:08,949 --> 00:05:11,451
What if he caught something really bad?

65
00:05:12,453 --> 00:05:15,456
- Like some kind of infection?
- lnfection?

66
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:17,250
Where did you get that idea?

67
00:05:17,333 --> 00:05:19,335
Rousseau was here.

68
00:05:21,921 --> 00:05:25,258
- What did she say to you?
- She said she knew he was sick. OK?

69
00:05:25,341 --> 00:05:28,721
- That he's infected.
- Claire, there is no infection.

70
00:05:28,804 --> 00:05:31,932
We've been on this island for two months
and no one's gotten sick.

71
00:05:32,016 --> 00:05:35,769
Rousseau's crazy. We're gonna
let the fever just run its course.

72
00:05:35,853 --> 00:05:38,898
He's gonna be fine. OK? Trust me.

73
00:05:39,899 --> 00:05:41,817
l'm gonna get back to the hatch,

74
00:05:41,901 --> 00:05:45,405
but l'll come back in a couple hours
and check on him again, OK?

75
00:05:45,488 --> 00:05:47,365
- OK?
- Yeah.

76
00:05:55,206 --> 00:05:58,753
Hey. l'm sure that if there was
something wrong, Jack would know.

77
00:06:04,091 --> 00:06:07,094
Are you sure about this?
We don't really know her.

78
00:06:07,178 --> 00:06:09,180
l think she can help me.

79
00:06:11,098 --> 00:06:13,727
- Hey.
- Hey, guys.

80
00:06:13,810 --> 00:06:15,812
So, you're a shrink, right?

81
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:21,443
l'm a clinical psychologist,
but ''shrink'' works, too.

82
00:06:21,526 --> 00:06:23,946
Can you help people remember things?

83
00:06:24,821 --> 00:06:27,616
l guess it depends
on what you need to remember.

84
00:06:29,911 --> 00:06:32,247
So, it was
our second week on the island.

85
00:06:32,330 --> 00:06:35,750
l was out in the jungle, and l...
l thought l was having the baby.

86
00:06:35,833 --> 00:06:39,837
Charlie was with me,
and there was this man, Ethan.

87
00:06:39,921 --> 00:06:43,801
We thought he was one of us
from the plane, but he wasn't.

88
00:06:43,884 --> 00:06:45,761
So, he took me. He took both of us.

89
00:06:45,844 --> 00:06:49,682
And l don't remember...
l don't remember anything.

90
00:06:49,765 --> 00:06:53,560
When Jack and l found Charlie,
he was hanging from a tree, by his neck.

91
00:06:53,644 --> 00:06:55,646
l have no idea what happened,

92
00:06:55,729 --> 00:06:58,692
and now l'm seeing these flashes
of things and...

93
00:06:58,775 --> 00:07:00,277
You know, l have amnesia.

94
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:02,904
There's two weeks missing from my life.

95
00:07:02,988 --> 00:07:05,365
Claire, l don't think you have amnesia.

96
00:07:05,991 --> 00:07:08,535
Sometimes
when something terrible happens,

97
00:07:08,618 --> 00:07:10,829
a little switch in your head flicks on

98
00:07:10,912 --> 00:07:13,833
to protect us
from having to deal with it.

99
00:07:13,916 --> 00:07:16,460
Maybe your memories aren't gone.

100
00:07:16,544 --> 00:07:18,921
Maybe you're just blocking them.

101
00:07:22,383 --> 00:07:24,385
Then l need you to unblock them.

102
00:07:25,011 --> 00:07:28,098
Because my baby's sick,
and they did something to him.

103
00:07:42,696 --> 00:07:45,992
- Do you have to go to the bathroom?
- No.

104
00:07:46,075 --> 00:07:49,996
- Well, just let us know when you do.
- Yeah, l'll look forward to that.

105
00:07:54,667 --> 00:07:56,961
Thought you might like
something to read.

106
00:07:57,045 --> 00:07:58,839
Dostoyevsky.

107
00:07:59,757 --> 00:08:04,053
- You don't have any Stephen King?
- Mm-mm. Library's a little outdated.

108
00:08:04,136 --> 00:08:06,055
Right.

109
00:08:06,138 --> 00:08:07,890
Well, thanks.

110
00:08:13,396 --> 00:08:15,440
What's with the book?

111
00:08:16,232 --> 00:08:18,151
Just something to pass the time.

112
00:08:21,279 --> 00:08:25,116
Did you know that Hemingway
was jealous of Dostoyevsky?

113
00:08:26,076 --> 00:08:28,203
No, John, l didn't know that.

114
00:08:28,286 --> 00:08:30,748
He wanted to be
the world's greatest writer,

115
00:08:30,831 --> 00:08:33,251
but convinced himself
he could never get out

116
00:08:33,334 --> 00:08:35,253
from under Dostoyevsky's shadow.

117
00:08:35,336 --> 00:08:37,797
Kind of sad, really.

118
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:40,341
What are we doing, Jack?

119
00:08:40,424 --> 00:08:43,679
- What are we doing?
- We can't hide him down here forever.

120
00:08:43,762 --> 00:08:46,390
Changing shifts will
make people ask questions.

121
00:08:46,473 --> 00:08:49,434
l just want to know
what the long-term plan is.

122
00:08:50,852 --> 00:08:53,313
Well, John, let me ask you this:

123
00:08:53,397 --> 00:08:55,899
we don't have a long-term plan
for the button,

124
00:08:55,983 --> 00:08:58,068
but we keep pushing it, don't we?

125
00:09:01,197 --> 00:09:05,285
Look, until we know who he is,
whether or not he's telling the truth,

126
00:09:05,368 --> 00:09:07,620
we have to keep doing what we're doing.

127
00:09:08,329 --> 00:09:10,498
lf you've a better idea, let's hear it.

128
00:09:10,582 --> 00:09:12,792
How about you let me go?

129
00:09:21,093 --> 00:09:25,014
Now we're away
from all the noises of the camp.

130
00:09:26,015 --> 00:09:27,850
Just breathe.

131
00:09:27,933 --> 00:09:30,478
Let your whole body relax.

132
00:09:31,855 --> 00:09:34,316
Good. Listen to the waves.

133
00:09:39,529 --> 00:09:40,947
Good. ln...

134
00:09:42,616 --> 00:09:45,453
...and out, slowly.

135
00:09:45,536 --> 00:09:46,913
Good.

136
00:09:48,205 --> 00:09:50,541
Keep your eyes closed.

137
00:09:52,877 --> 00:09:54,962
Very relaxed, Claire.

138
00:09:56,297 --> 00:09:58,382
Just keep breathing.

139
00:09:58,466 --> 00:10:03,221
Now, l want you to visualise yourself
when you were pregnant.

140
00:10:04,514 --> 00:10:06,475
Keep listening to my voice.

141
00:10:08,185 --> 00:10:10,395
Think about what you see.

142
00:10:17,779 --> 00:10:21,032
We don't want him to get sick.

143
00:10:23,826 --> 00:10:26,162
When was your last checkup, Claire?

144
00:10:26,246 --> 00:10:29,625
Oh, l haven't been in a while.

145
00:10:29,708 --> 00:10:31,710
l've been busy.

146
00:10:31,794 --> 00:10:34,755
- l'm going to Los Angeles.
- Really?

147
00:10:34,838 --> 00:10:37,132
- Yeah.
- Travelling in your third trimester,

148
00:10:37,216 --> 00:10:40,970
- that's not usually recommended.
- Well, there's a family there.

149
00:10:41,053 --> 00:10:44,724
l'm, uh,
giving the baby up for adoption.

150
00:10:44,808 --> 00:10:47,185
Oh. Of course. l understand.

151
00:10:49,562 --> 00:10:51,815
The sedative l gave you was very mild.

152
00:10:51,898 --> 00:10:54,484
l know these exams
can be very stressful.

153
00:10:56,069 --> 00:10:58,405
l'm going to give you a shot now,
Claire.

154
00:11:01,701 --> 00:11:03,703
A little medicine for your baby.

155
00:11:15,132 --> 00:11:19,303
Don't worry,
you're just gonna feel a little pinch.

156
00:11:25,934 --> 00:11:29,396
lt's OK! You're all right!
lt's OK, it's OK.

157
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:31,899
lt was Ethan! l saw Ethan!

158
00:11:31,983 --> 00:11:34,193
l saw him! lt was Ethan!

159
00:11:37,864 --> 00:11:39,073
lt's OK.

160
00:11:39,157 --> 00:11:40,491
- No!
- You're all right.

161
00:11:40,575 --> 00:11:42,952
No! l'm not all right!
lt was Ethan!

162
00:11:43,036 --> 00:11:45,998
- What happened? What did you do?
- Nothing! She...

163
00:11:46,081 --> 00:11:49,710
- Do it again. Do it again!
- No, Claire, you were screaming.

164
00:11:49,793 --> 00:11:51,420
But l remembered! OK?

165
00:11:51,503 --> 00:11:54,798
l saw Ethan. He was there
and he was giving me an exam.

166
00:11:54,882 --> 00:11:58,427
What you saw could be combining
experiences from before the crash

167
00:11:58,510 --> 00:12:02,057
- to things that happened to you here.
- No! No! This was real. OK?

168
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:04,351
l was drugged.

169
00:12:04,434 --> 00:12:06,728
- They did something to me.
- Calm down.

170
00:12:06,811 --> 00:12:09,981
- lt's not good for Aaron...
- You know what? Aaron is sick.

171
00:12:10,065 --> 00:12:12,400
l need to find that place, that room.

172
00:12:12,484 --> 00:12:14,694
lt's real. lt's real. OK?

173
00:12:14,779 --> 00:12:17,823
And there's medicine there for the baby.

174
00:12:17,907 --> 00:12:19,992
l need to find it. l need to find it.

175
00:12:23,287 --> 00:12:27,083
Kate, please help me find it.

176
00:12:54,570 --> 00:12:55,989
Hello?

177
00:13:00,828 --> 00:13:02,579
Hello?

178
00:13:03,539 --> 00:13:04,707
What's the...

179
00:13:07,042 --> 00:13:09,253
Hello?

180
00:13:09,336 --> 00:13:11,046
Howdy.

181
00:13:11,130 --> 00:13:12,798
Hello, John.

182
00:13:13,591 --> 00:13:16,428
- You are alone?
- Not anymore.

183
00:13:16,511 --> 00:13:19,055
- How many...
- Shut up.

184
00:13:21,349 --> 00:13:23,435
l was hoping to borrow a saw.

185
00:13:25,687 --> 00:13:27,939
Absolutely. Right this way.

186
00:13:43,122 --> 00:13:45,792
l need a gun,
and you don't get to ask why.

187
00:13:46,835 --> 00:13:51,548
Well, Thelma, seeing as
l got all the guns, l do get to ask why.

188
00:13:51,632 --> 00:13:54,551
- No, you don't.
- Yes, l do.

189
00:13:55,636 --> 00:13:57,137
Watch.

190
00:13:58,180 --> 00:14:01,351
- Why?
- Just give me a gun, Sawyer.

191
00:14:02,936 --> 00:14:07,440
Check it out. Found a new pair of
glasses, damn near my prescription.

192
00:14:07,523 --> 00:14:09,192
You like 'em?

193
00:14:11,986 --> 00:14:15,866
All right, l'm going into the jungle
to track down Rousseau.

194
00:14:15,950 --> 00:14:18,494
The French chick? What for?

195
00:14:18,577 --> 00:14:21,997
Claire thinks she knows where
there might be some medicine.

196
00:14:22,081 --> 00:14:23,749
The baby's sick.

197
00:14:23,832 --> 00:14:27,252
- Well, hell, l got medicine.
- She thinks he's really sick.

198
00:14:27,336 --> 00:14:29,338
As in ''quarantine'' sick.

199
00:14:31,466 --> 00:14:34,719
- What do you think?
- l think she's a little too worried.

200
00:14:35,804 --> 00:14:38,932
But she's going after Rousseau
with or without me.

201
00:14:39,015 --> 00:14:40,809
No boys allowed, huh?

202
00:14:47,733 --> 00:14:50,903
All right, what do you want?
Nine millimetre or rifle?

203
00:14:57,660 --> 00:15:01,331
l don't think this is a good idea.
Maybe you should listen to Jack.

204
00:15:01,415 --> 00:15:04,835
What if Jack's wrong? He said
the fever would break. lt hasn't.

205
00:15:04,918 --> 00:15:08,046
- He's getting worse.
- Just because it hasn't broken...

206
00:15:08,130 --> 00:15:10,465
How long am l supposed to wait, Sun?

207
00:15:13,885 --> 00:15:16,472
A mother should not leave her child.

208
00:15:19,017 --> 00:15:20,727
l'm sorry, are you a mother?

209
00:15:22,437 --> 00:15:23,813
No.

210
00:15:24,814 --> 00:15:26,357
l'm not.

211
00:15:29,694 --> 00:15:32,364
Claire,
are you sure you want to do this?

212
00:15:36,535 --> 00:15:40,164
- What did you say?
- Are you sure you want to do this?

213
00:15:41,999 --> 00:15:45,919
- You need to be sure.
- You have to get out of here.

214
00:15:53,178 --> 00:15:55,555
Do you have to put that in my tummy?

215
00:15:55,639 --> 00:15:58,058
lt really, really hurts.

216
00:15:58,141 --> 00:16:00,143
l know.

217
00:16:00,226 --> 00:16:02,480
l wish there was another way...

218
00:16:03,606 --> 00:16:06,400
but the baby needs it, Claire, OK?

219
00:16:08,527 --> 00:16:10,029
OK.

220
00:16:20,874 --> 00:16:23,293
There. All done.

221
00:16:23,377 --> 00:16:25,379
That wasn't so bad, was it?

222
00:16:27,089 --> 00:16:28,423
No.

223
00:16:29,216 --> 00:16:32,178
And now,
because you've been such a good girl,

224
00:16:32,261 --> 00:16:34,263
l think it's time for a surprise.

225
00:16:54,076 --> 00:16:56,370
Claire, this way, here we go.

226
00:16:56,996 --> 00:16:58,622
Over here.

227
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:08,967
What is this place?

228
00:17:09,050 --> 00:17:10,885
lt's for your baby, Claire.

229
00:17:10,969 --> 00:17:12,846
Oh, it's amazing.

230
00:17:21,606 --> 00:17:24,025
What happened to Charlie?

231
00:17:24,108 --> 00:17:28,029
Charlie? Oh, he's fine. When we got far
enough from camp, l let him go back.

232
00:17:29,572 --> 00:17:30,781
Oh.

233
00:17:31,532 --> 00:17:33,910
So, where did it all come from?

234
00:17:33,994 --> 00:17:36,747
Ha! l'd love to explain
everything to you, Claire,

235
00:17:36,830 --> 00:17:40,042
but l'm afraid it would be
a little overwhelming right now.

236
00:17:48,926 --> 00:17:51,137
Go ahead. Turn it on.

237
00:18:06,654 --> 00:18:09,823
- Ethan!
- Wait here, l'll be right back.

238
00:18:11,825 --> 00:18:13,243
OK.

239
00:18:17,874 --> 00:18:19,334
What the hell happened?

240
00:18:19,417 --> 00:18:23,254
You were supposed to make the list
and then bring her in. Was l unclear?

241
00:18:23,338 --> 00:18:27,384
lt's not my fault. They knew l wasn't
on the plane. They had a manifest.

242
00:18:27,467 --> 00:18:29,719
Well, what am l supposed to tell him?

243
00:18:30,595 --> 00:18:34,892
Do you know what he's going to do
when he finds out? Damn it, Ethan.

244
00:18:42,358 --> 00:18:45,444
Get out. Get out of here.

245
00:18:49,449 --> 00:18:51,076
Claire?

246
00:18:52,202 --> 00:18:55,080
Claire? Are you all right?

247
00:18:56,915 --> 00:18:58,292
l, um...

248
00:19:03,881 --> 00:19:05,758
Ready to go?

249
00:19:09,012 --> 00:19:10,305
Sweetheart, shh.

250
00:19:10,388 --> 00:19:13,057
Mummy's gotta go now, sweetheart, OK?

251
00:19:13,141 --> 00:19:16,060
Shh, don't cry, don't cry, it's OK.

252
00:19:16,144 --> 00:19:20,024
l'll be back really soon and l'll make
you feel all better, OK? l promise.

253
00:19:26,071 --> 00:19:28,365
- Thanks.
- OK.

254
00:19:38,001 --> 00:19:40,003
- You OK?
- Yeah.

255
00:19:47,845 --> 00:19:50,556
You're sure this is her trail?

256
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:54,435
We started at the exact spot
where we chased her off the beach.

257
00:19:54,518 --> 00:19:57,772
- So, what do you know about Rousseau?
- Not much.

258
00:19:57,855 --> 00:20:00,816
You spent time with her
when you went to the Black Rock.

259
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:03,153
You must have talked about something.

260
00:20:03,236 --> 00:20:08,075
Just about her ship crashing here
and her research team getting stranded.

261
00:20:08,158 --> 00:20:10,243
What happened to them?

262
00:20:11,578 --> 00:20:13,330
They died.

263
00:20:14,206 --> 00:20:15,832
How?

264
00:20:16,792 --> 00:20:21,172
- Tracks are gone. Trail ends here.
- Kate, how did they die?

265
00:20:23,091 --> 00:20:26,219
- She killed them.
- What?

266
00:20:26,302 --> 00:20:29,138
- Why would she...
- Because they were infected.

267
00:20:33,477 --> 00:20:35,270
You believe me now, don't you?

268
00:20:35,354 --> 00:20:37,856
l want you to take me back there.

269
00:20:38,857 --> 00:20:40,734
- Back?
- To where l scratched you.

270
00:20:40,818 --> 00:20:43,862
- Claire...
- No, OK, she knows l remember.

271
00:20:43,946 --> 00:20:45,572
OK, l remember a lot of it now.

272
00:20:45,656 --> 00:20:51,288
l remember the room,
the medicine, a teenage girl...

273
00:20:51,371 --> 00:20:55,208
OK? So don't lie and make out
you don't know what l'm talking about.

274
00:20:55,292 --> 00:20:58,712
My baby is sick. You're gonna
take me there to get what he needs.

275
00:20:58,795 --> 00:21:00,255
Right now.

276
00:21:03,259 --> 00:21:05,219
lt's not far from here.

277
00:21:19,735 --> 00:21:23,113
Jack, may l have a word with you?

278
00:21:24,448 --> 00:21:25,782
Sure.

279
00:21:27,701 --> 00:21:30,537
- Who is he?
- What?

280
00:21:31,538 --> 00:21:34,042
The man that you are keeping
in the hatch.

281
00:21:39,797 --> 00:21:42,383
- Did Locke...
- Locke did not tell me anything.

282
00:21:42,467 --> 00:21:44,469
Who is he?

283
00:21:47,513 --> 00:21:52,144
- l wish to speak to him.
- Speak to him about what?

284
00:21:52,227 --> 00:21:54,313
l wish to speak to him alone.

285
00:21:55,022 --> 00:21:56,982
Can you arrange this?

286
00:21:58,734 --> 00:22:00,736
Why should l do that?

287
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:03,907
Because you wish to keep this a secret.

288
00:22:27,181 --> 00:22:29,266
Why are we stopping here?

289
00:22:30,267 --> 00:22:32,478
This is where you scratched me.

290
00:22:33,814 --> 00:22:35,857
But there's nothing here.

291
00:22:37,859 --> 00:22:40,862
- Where do we go next?
- Why are you asking me that?

292
00:22:40,946 --> 00:22:44,032
- You need to tell me where to go.
- Where is this room?

293
00:22:44,116 --> 00:22:47,202
How can you be saying that?
OK, you grabbed me.

294
00:22:47,286 --> 00:22:50,623
l scratched you because
you were taking me back to them!

295
00:22:50,707 --> 00:22:52,667
ls that what you think?

296
00:22:54,585 --> 00:22:58,256
You said you remembered!
That's why l brought you here!

297
00:22:59,799 --> 00:23:03,386
- You lied!
- Hey! Get your hands off of her!

298
00:23:16,025 --> 00:23:17,568
Go ahead.

299
00:23:18,694 --> 00:23:20,071
Please.

300
00:23:20,905 --> 00:23:22,157
Do it.

301
00:23:32,709 --> 00:23:33,793
Claire!

302
00:23:40,092 --> 00:23:41,552
Claire!

303
00:23:57,277 --> 00:23:58,570
Wake up.

304
00:24:00,405 --> 00:24:04,452
- How's it coming?
- One down, one to go.

305
00:24:04,535 --> 00:24:06,913
All we need is a little foot
to put it on, huh?

306
00:24:08,998 --> 00:24:14,337
Tell you what. What do you say
we sneak out of here and take a walk?

307
00:24:14,420 --> 00:24:15,588
OK.

308
00:24:18,257 --> 00:24:22,429
Whoa! l'm sorry this is the first time
l've managed to get you out.

309
00:24:22,513 --> 00:24:25,224
- My friends are afraid you'll run away.
- Whoops!

310
00:24:25,307 --> 00:24:28,852
- Whoa! Don't tell on me, OK?
- OK.

311
00:24:28,936 --> 00:24:31,605
Whoa. Easy now. All right.

312
00:24:33,273 --> 00:24:35,860
- Easy. Easy!
- Whoo!

313
00:24:35,944 --> 00:24:38,405
- Whoa.
- Yeah!

314
00:24:38,488 --> 00:24:40,323
OK, here, this'll help.

315
00:24:41,449 --> 00:24:43,326
Oh, thanks.

316
00:24:47,038 --> 00:24:48,039
What?

317
00:24:48,123 --> 00:24:50,543
- That is really sour.
- ls it?

318
00:24:51,127 --> 00:24:52,503
l hadn't noticed.

319
00:24:55,923 --> 00:24:59,051
Oh! Hey, he's kicking!

320
00:25:01,095 --> 00:25:03,973
- May l?
- Yeah.

321
00:25:08,437 --> 00:25:11,732
- Claire, can l tell you a secret?
- Yeah.

322
00:25:11,815 --> 00:25:15,193
l'm going to miss you. l...

323
00:25:17,404 --> 00:25:19,615
l wish you didn't have to go.

324
00:25:21,117 --> 00:25:23,286
Well, maybe l don't have to go.

325
00:25:25,163 --> 00:25:27,081
We've been through this, Claire.

326
00:25:27,165 --> 00:25:30,126
There's not enough vaccine
for you and the baby.

327
00:25:30,209 --> 00:25:32,879
- But l'm not... l'm not sick.
- Thank God.

328
00:25:32,962 --> 00:25:34,632
And once you've delivered,

329
00:25:34,715 --> 00:25:38,344
you can go back to your friends
and hopefully you'll stay that way.

330
00:25:40,346 --> 00:25:43,557
But, what...
What if l want to see the baby?

331
00:25:47,186 --> 00:25:51,566
Hey, nobody is going to take him
from you unless that's what you want.

332
00:25:52,233 --> 00:25:54,277
You have a choice.

333
00:25:59,324 --> 00:26:03,161
We're good people, Claire.
We're a good family.

334
00:26:04,579 --> 00:26:10,294
But if you're going to trust us with
your child, l want you to be sure.

335
00:26:14,382 --> 00:26:15,925
OK?

336
00:26:31,316 --> 00:26:32,442
Sure.

337
00:26:36,114 --> 00:26:37,782
There you are.

338
00:26:40,118 --> 00:26:42,036
Where are you going?

339
00:26:47,375 --> 00:26:50,671
l know this is it. lt's here.

340
00:26:50,754 --> 00:26:52,464
Claire?

341
00:26:57,219 --> 00:26:59,471
- Leave her alone.
- Excuse me?

342
00:26:59,555 --> 00:27:02,558
- Let her look.
- Look for what?

343
00:27:08,773 --> 00:27:10,358
Claire!

344
00:27:13,236 --> 00:27:14,612
Claire!

345
00:28:24,437 --> 00:28:26,231
Flashlights.

346
00:28:45,918 --> 00:28:51,049
No lights. l'm gonna see
if l can turn the power on. You OK?

347
00:28:57,431 --> 00:28:59,182
This way.

348
00:29:40,226 --> 00:29:42,395
What is this place?

349
00:29:42,479 --> 00:29:44,564
lt's where they were going to keep him.

350
00:30:42,918 --> 00:30:45,504
Wake up!

351
00:30:45,587 --> 00:30:47,089
Wake up.

352
00:30:48,340 --> 00:30:50,134
- Who are you?
- Shh!

353
00:30:50,217 --> 00:30:53,513
They'll hear you.
Look, you have to get out of here.

354
00:30:53,596 --> 00:30:56,307
- What?
- You have to get out of here. Now.

355
00:30:56,391 --> 00:30:59,144
- What? No, no, no. l can't leave.
- Yes, you can.

356
00:30:59,227 --> 00:31:02,063
- l can't leave! No!
- Come on.

357
00:31:02,147 --> 00:31:04,524
- What are you doing?
- Shh!

358
00:31:06,694 --> 00:31:07,903
Shh.

359
00:31:12,074 --> 00:31:13,576
Don't scream.

360
00:31:16,454 --> 00:31:20,124
- They're gonna do it tonight.
- What? Do what?

361
00:31:20,207 --> 00:31:22,127
- Shh!
- What are you talking about?

362
00:31:22,210 --> 00:31:25,339
You are going to die.
They are gonna cut him out of you.

363
00:31:26,006 --> 00:31:28,884
l can get you back to your camp,
but we have to leave now.

364
00:31:28,967 --> 00:31:30,093
Hey, you're lying!

365
00:31:30,177 --> 00:31:33,055
- You're lying! OK? l'm sure about this!
- Shh!

366
00:31:33,138 --> 00:31:34,931
- l want to talk to Ethan.
- Stop!

367
00:31:35,015 --> 00:31:37,810
- Ethan wouldn't hurt me.
- Shh!

368
00:31:37,894 --> 00:31:40,271
You'll thank me for this one day.

369
00:31:40,355 --> 00:31:41,898
lt's a vaccine.

370
00:31:41,981 --> 00:31:43,816
We don't want him to get sick.

371
00:31:46,986 --> 00:31:49,906
lt's here. The medicine's here.

372
00:32:00,292 --> 00:32:02,086
Help me.

373
00:32:04,046 --> 00:32:07,467
Help! Kate! Come here, l need some help!

374
00:32:08,927 --> 00:32:12,138
- Help me out with this.
- What is it?

375
00:32:12,222 --> 00:32:15,266
lt's in here. The vaccine's in here!

376
00:32:16,184 --> 00:32:17,686
OK, come on.

377
00:32:17,769 --> 00:32:20,980
OK. One, two, three!

378
00:32:27,321 --> 00:32:28,823
OK.

379
00:32:34,704 --> 00:32:37,874
lt was in here! The vaccine was in here!

380
00:32:37,958 --> 00:32:40,085
Where is it? Where is it?

381
00:32:40,168 --> 00:32:42,504
The vaccine was in here! Where is it?

382
00:32:43,547 --> 00:32:45,799
You were bringing me back here!
Where is it?

383
00:32:45,882 --> 00:32:49,678
You know where it is, don't you?
Tell me! Tell me where it is!

384
00:32:49,761 --> 00:32:51,346
Tell me!

385
00:33:19,585 --> 00:33:22,756
Ethan? Ethan?

386
00:33:24,716 --> 00:33:27,802
Ethan? Ethan, l'm sure!

387
00:33:34,601 --> 00:33:35,977
Ethan!

388
00:33:37,646 --> 00:33:41,400
Hey, hey, Ethan! Ethan!

389
00:33:42,109 --> 00:33:45,488
l'm... l'm sure!
l want you take the baby.

390
00:33:46,489 --> 00:33:47,865
Ethan.

391
00:33:55,499 --> 00:33:57,084
Who are... Who are you?

392
00:33:57,167 --> 00:34:00,337
- Claire?
- Yeah! l'm here!

393
00:34:00,420 --> 00:34:04,341
- l can hear you! Where are you?
- Quiet!

394
00:34:04,424 --> 00:34:07,219
- l'm here, Ethan!
- Be quiet.

395
00:34:07,302 --> 00:34:09,055
l have to give him to them.

396
00:34:09,138 --> 00:34:11,808
l have to give him to them
so he'll be safe. OK?

397
00:34:11,891 --> 00:34:15,269
Help! l'm here! Ethan!

398
00:34:15,353 --> 00:34:16,521
Claire!

399
00:34:19,107 --> 00:34:21,776
Claire! Where are you?

400
00:34:30,202 --> 00:34:34,289
You weren't trying to take me back,
were you?

401
00:34:36,709 --> 00:34:39,087
You were trying to save me.

402
00:34:40,964 --> 00:34:43,133
l carried you on my back to your camp.

403
00:34:44,884 --> 00:34:46,928
l left you where they would find you.

404
00:34:50,682 --> 00:34:52,392
l'm sorry.

405
00:34:59,567 --> 00:35:01,652
Where are you going?

406
00:35:04,905 --> 00:35:08,618
You're not the only one who didn't
find what they were looking for.

407
00:35:37,357 --> 00:35:39,151
This is as far as l go.

408
00:35:44,406 --> 00:35:46,325
Your baby...

409
00:35:48,243 --> 00:35:50,204
...was it a girl?

410
00:35:51,205 --> 00:35:53,750
- Yes.
- What was her name?

411
00:35:56,711 --> 00:35:57,962
Alex.

412
00:35:59,005 --> 00:36:00,507
Alexandra.

413
00:36:07,263 --> 00:36:09,475
l remember a girl.

414
00:36:10,393 --> 00:36:12,395
A girl with blue eyes.

415
00:36:16,023 --> 00:36:19,485
She, uh... She helped me. She saved me.

416
00:36:19,568 --> 00:36:21,362
Just like you did.

417
00:36:22,822 --> 00:36:24,783
She wasn't like the others.

418
00:36:26,952 --> 00:36:28,995
She was good.

419
00:36:43,052 --> 00:36:47,515
l am sorry that you didn't
find what you were looking for.

420
00:36:50,768 --> 00:36:53,438
And l hope your baby is not infected.

421
00:36:57,568 --> 00:36:59,319
But if it is...

422
00:37:02,698 --> 00:37:05,075
...l hope you know what must be done.

423
00:37:35,691 --> 00:37:37,401
Back for more tools?

424
00:37:38,319 --> 00:37:40,280
He knows, John.

425
00:37:42,949 --> 00:37:44,576
Well, there you go.

426
00:37:47,496 --> 00:37:52,292
Just be careful what you say to him.
He's smart and curious.

427
00:37:52,376 --> 00:37:57,215
- Just give us a shout when you're done.
- And if the alarm goes off...

428
00:37:57,298 --> 00:37:59,676
...don't tell him what it's for.

429
00:37:59,759 --> 00:38:01,844
What is it for?

430
00:38:20,906 --> 00:38:22,574
Hello.

431
00:38:29,416 --> 00:38:31,084
l am Mr Eko.

432
00:38:34,796 --> 00:38:36,506
Henry Gale.

433
00:38:37,465 --> 00:38:39,217
Do you mind if l sit, Henry?

434
00:38:40,469 --> 00:38:41,971
OK.

435
00:38:52,148 --> 00:38:54,400
How long have you been in here?

436
00:38:55,318 --> 00:38:59,072
- Two days.
- Are they treating you well?

437
00:39:00,574 --> 00:39:02,492
Treating me well?

438
00:39:04,119 --> 00:39:06,705
l'm a... a prisoner.

439
00:39:07,914 --> 00:39:11,753
- And l don't know why or for what or...
- You are a prisoner

440
00:39:11,836 --> 00:39:13,880
because they are being careful.

441
00:39:15,131 --> 00:39:19,218
They are being careful
because they believe you are lying.

442
00:39:19,302 --> 00:39:21,304
Why would l lie?

443
00:39:22,430 --> 00:39:24,767
They think l'm one of these Others?

444
00:39:24,850 --> 00:39:28,312
- Other what?
- Please stop talking, Henry.

445
00:39:31,982 --> 00:39:34,902
The first night l spent on this island,

446
00:39:36,028 --> 00:39:39,490
l was dragged into the jungle
by two men.

447
00:39:41,076 --> 00:39:44,913
They never spoke a word to me,
nor l to them.

448
00:39:47,582 --> 00:39:49,250
l killed these men.

449
00:39:50,168 --> 00:39:52,670
Smashed in their head with a stone.

450
00:39:52,754 --> 00:39:54,547
Felt their blood on my arms.

451
00:39:59,470 --> 00:40:03,808
l need you to know
how sorry l am for this.

452
00:40:06,977 --> 00:40:11,650
l need you to know
that l am back on a righteous path now

453
00:40:11,733 --> 00:40:13,777
and that l regret my actions.

454
00:40:19,074 --> 00:40:21,368
l ask you for your forgiveness.

455
00:40:23,995 --> 00:40:25,915
Why are you telling me this?

456
00:40:27,959 --> 00:40:30,169
Because l needed to tell someone.

457
00:41:19,764 --> 00:41:23,184
He looks good. Fever's broken.

458
00:41:23,267 --> 00:41:27,898
- The rash has even started to fade.
- Thank you so much.

459
00:41:29,024 --> 00:41:30,567
l didn't do anything.

460
00:41:30,650 --> 00:41:34,196
- l'll check back in a coupla hours, OK?
- OK.

461
00:41:57,262 --> 00:41:58,639
Look.

462
00:41:59,473 --> 00:42:01,517
Mummy made this for you

463
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:04,353
when you were still inside her tummy.

464
00:42:12,904 --> 00:42:16,991
You know, l wanted them to take you.

465
00:42:23,790 --> 00:42:28,462
But now l know. Now l know
that we're supposed to be together.

466
00:42:29,547 --> 00:42:35,511
You and me. We're supposed
to take care of each other, OK?

467
00:42:44,062 --> 00:42:45,814
You're mine.

468
00:42:45,897 --> 00:42:48,483
And l love you. l love you so much.

469
00:42:50,569 --> 00:42:51,987
Yes.

470
00:43:15,345 --> 00:43:18,599
- No cheeseburgers, huh?
- No cheeseburgers.

471
00:43:18,682 --> 00:43:20,559
<i>Bon app?tit.</i>

472
00:43:24,104 --> 00:43:26,691
ls that true
what you said about Hemingway?

473
00:43:29,944 --> 00:43:32,989
- You have good ears.
- You have thin doors.

474
00:43:37,952 --> 00:43:40,580
- You read Hemingway?
- Sure.

475
00:43:40,663 --> 00:43:43,918
Guy ran with the bulls.
Fought in the Spanish Civil War.

476
00:43:44,001 --> 00:43:47,797
Stuff l can wrap my brain around.
This, l can't get through five pages of.

477
00:43:49,507 --> 00:43:52,259
Dostoyevsky had his virtues, too.

478
00:43:52,343 --> 00:43:55,054
He was a genius, for one.

479
00:43:55,137 --> 00:43:57,015
Bullfighting isn't everything.

480
00:43:59,267 --> 00:44:00,852
So which one are you?

481
00:44:02,854 --> 00:44:05,690
- l'm sorry?
- Are you the genius?

482
00:44:05,774 --> 00:44:10,904
Or are you the guy who always feels like
he's living in the shadow of the genius?

483
00:44:12,949 --> 00:44:15,201
l was...

484
00:44:16,077 --> 00:44:19,747
l was never very much
into literary analysis.

485
00:44:26,714 --> 00:44:30,092
l just don't understand
why you let the doctor call the shots.

486
00:44:33,095 --> 00:44:35,097
No one calls the shots.

487
00:44:37,433 --> 00:44:39,643
Jack and l make decisions together.

488
00:44:42,105 --> 00:44:43,523
Right. OK.

489
00:44:49,070 --> 00:44:50,613
My mistake.
