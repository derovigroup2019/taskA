<i>Previously on Lost:</i>

2
00:00:03,448 --> 00:00:04,528
Goodbye, John.

3
00:00:04,575 --> 00:00:07,244
You're gonna have to lie.
It's the only way to protect it.

4
00:00:07,286 --> 00:00:10,737
It's an island, John.
No one needs to protect it.

5
00:00:10,789 --> 00:00:12,331
It's a place where miracles happen.

6
00:00:12,374 --> 00:00:14,117
There's no such thing as miracles.

7
00:00:14,168 --> 00:00:17,003
We gotta get every ounce of
extra weight off this chopper now!

8
00:00:17,045 --> 00:00:19,371
Anything not bolted down
toss it out!

9
00:00:20,632 --> 00:00:22,091
Sawyer!

10
00:00:22,134 --> 00:00:24,589
There's enough C4 here to blow up
a bloody aircraft carrier.

11
00:00:24,636 --> 00:00:27,471
This is a radio receiver.
It triggers the bomb remotely.

12
00:00:27,514 --> 00:00:30,266
I took out a bit of
a life insurance policy, Ben.

13
00:00:30,309 --> 00:00:32,052
You killed my daughter.

14
00:00:34,354 --> 00:00:37,521
- You just killed everybody on the boat.
- So?

15
00:00:50,204 --> 00:00:53,869
Excuse me, sir, I'm sorry to bother you.
Do you have the time, please?

16
00:00:53,916 --> 00:00:55,659
Yeah. It's 8.15...

17
00:01:31,829 --> 00:01:34,865
- Sayid?
- Hello, Hurley.

18
00:01:38,710 --> 00:01:42,411
- I think visiting hours are over, dude.
- This isn't a visit.

19
00:01:43,507 --> 00:01:45,546
I want you to come with me.

20
00:01:46,343 --> 00:01:48,799
- Come with you where?
- Somewhere safe.

21
00:01:48,846 --> 00:01:51,301
Now why would I go anywhere with you?

22
00:01:51,348 --> 00:01:53,886
I haven't seen you in, like, forever.

23
00:01:53,934 --> 00:01:56,223
Because circumstances have changed.

24
00:01:57,020 --> 00:01:58,563
What circumstances?

25
00:01:59,648 --> 00:02:01,356
Bentham's dead.

26
00:02:03,944 --> 00:02:06,233
- What?
- Two days ago.

27
00:02:08,532 --> 00:02:10,987
- What happened?
- They said it was suicide.

28
00:02:11,034 --> 00:02:13,786
What do you mean
they said it was suicide?

29
00:02:13,829 --> 00:02:16,367
And why do you call him Bentham?
His name is...

30
00:02:16,415 --> 00:02:17,909
Don't say it.

31
00:02:21,503 --> 00:02:22,997
We're being watched.

32
00:02:23,755 --> 00:02:29,046
Dude, I've been having regular
conversations with dead people.

33
00:02:29,094 --> 00:02:31,301
The last thing I need now is paranoia.

34
00:02:31,346 --> 00:02:35,973
I just killed a man who's been perched
outside this facility for the last week.

35
00:02:37,186 --> 00:02:39,973
I'm finding paranoia keeps me alive.

36
00:02:44,067 --> 00:02:46,107
We're not going back, are we?

37
00:02:46,153 --> 00:02:47,777
No.

38
00:02:47,821 --> 00:02:49,861
Just somewhere safe.

39
00:02:54,912 --> 00:02:56,454
OK, then.

40
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:01,124
Hold on a sec.

41
00:03:06,798 --> 00:03:08,672
Checkmate, Mr Eko.

42
00:03:20,979 --> 00:03:24,562
- Where's the freighter?
- I don't know. I stayed on course.

43
00:03:24,608 --> 00:03:26,565
They must have it on the move again.

44
00:03:28,737 --> 00:03:30,481
How much fuel?

45
00:03:32,366 --> 00:03:35,984
Four, five minutes' worth,
unless somebody else wants to jump.

46
00:03:42,668 --> 00:03:45,289
Soon as we get to the boat
we'll go back for him.

47
00:03:46,213 --> 00:03:48,206
Hey!

48
00:03:48,257 --> 00:03:51,092
There it is, the boat! I see it!
It's behind us!

49
00:04:14,158 --> 00:04:18,155
Ben, help me. If he dies,
everybody on that boat dies.

50
00:04:20,372 --> 00:04:22,163
It's not my problem, John.

51
00:04:23,959 --> 00:04:25,916
Hang on, man. Hang on!

52
00:04:27,713 --> 00:04:29,124
Wherever you go...

53
00:04:33,385 --> 00:04:35,093
...Widmore...

54
00:04:38,348 --> 00:04:40,222
...he'll find you.

55
00:04:43,770 --> 00:04:46,059
Not if I find him first.

56
00:04:50,527 --> 00:04:52,734
Hey, no, no. Hey! Hey!

57
00:04:52,779 --> 00:04:54,274
Hey!

58
00:05:05,417 --> 00:05:06,698
You two need to go now.

59
00:05:06,752 --> 00:05:11,212
Get everybody off the boat. We have
maybe five minutes left in the tank.

60
00:05:11,256 --> 00:05:12,715
Go!

61
00:05:12,758 --> 00:05:14,667
You go. Go!

62
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,131
I stay.

63
00:05:52,714 --> 00:05:54,790
Oh, bloody hell.

64
00:06:00,806 --> 00:06:03,593
Don't land! You can't land!

65
00:06:03,642 --> 00:06:05,350
Go back!

66
00:06:09,148 --> 00:06:12,102
Go back! There's a bomb!

67
00:06:12,151 --> 00:06:15,484
There's a bomb!
Go back, there's a...

68
00:06:15,529 --> 00:06:18,779
- Get away! There's a bomb!
- Did he say "bomb"?

69
00:06:18,824 --> 00:06:20,615
Go back!

70
00:06:20,659 --> 00:06:24,075
- What are you doing?
- I don't care what he's screaming!

71
00:06:24,121 --> 00:06:27,537
I'm flying on fumes!
I gotta put this bird down.

72
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:29,871
No! Don't land!

73
00:06:57,988 --> 00:06:59,945
No, no! Look, you don't understand.

74
00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:03,525
Jin and Michael are doing everything
they can, but there's no time!

75
00:07:03,577 --> 00:07:05,616
You've gotta get off the boat now!

76
00:07:05,996 --> 00:07:07,823
How long till we can fly again?

77
00:07:07,873 --> 00:07:09,782
Somebody patch the other hole!

78
00:07:09,833 --> 00:07:12,870
- Give it to me, I'll do it.
- Here. Somebody pump some gas!

79
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:15,161
- I'll handle the fuel.
- Come on!

80
00:07:15,214 --> 00:07:18,001
Let's go!

81
00:07:19,551 --> 00:07:20,927
Hey, Sun!

82
00:07:20,969 --> 00:07:22,927
Sun! Where are you going?

83
00:07:22,971 --> 00:07:25,509
- Jin's below with Michael.
- There's no time.

84
00:07:25,557 --> 00:07:28,926
- I won't leave him!
- OK. Get the baby on the chopper.

85
00:07:28,977 --> 00:07:30,472
I'll get Jin, all right?

86
00:07:30,521 --> 00:07:33,356
Pump till I get it started.
It'll be enough to get to the island.

87
00:07:44,159 --> 00:07:45,488
Jin, you gotta go.

88
00:07:45,536 --> 00:07:48,371
- There's nothing more we can do.
- No, I can find...

89
00:07:48,413 --> 00:07:49,658
Come on, it's over.

90
00:07:49,706 --> 00:07:54,000
I'm almost out of this stuff.
Listen, you are a father now.

91
00:07:54,962 --> 00:07:57,038
Get to your wife and get her home.

92
00:07:58,715 --> 00:08:00,210
Thank you, Michael.

93
00:08:01,218 --> 00:08:02,546
You're welcome.

94
00:08:02,594 --> 00:08:03,757
Go.

95
00:08:12,354 --> 00:08:14,810
- Hey...
- Your buddy said we got five minutes

96
00:08:14,857 --> 00:08:17,811
three minutes ago. If you're going,
this is it. Let's go!

97
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:19,437
- Kate!
- Jin's still inside!

98
00:08:22,698 --> 00:08:24,904
Jin's still inside. Can't leave him.

99
00:08:24,950 --> 00:08:28,153
I'm not leaving without you.
We gotta get out of here now.

100
00:08:29,037 --> 00:08:30,117
Let's go!

101
00:08:39,256 --> 00:08:42,173
- Give me a minute! No!
- Where's Jin?

102
00:08:56,523 --> 00:08:57,602
It's Jin!

103
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:02,935
Jin!

104
00:09:02,988 --> 00:09:06,902
- Jin! We have to go back! Turn around!
- We can't do it!

105
00:09:06,950 --> 00:09:09,109
But we have to! We need to go back!

106
00:09:27,054 --> 00:09:28,678
You can go now, Michael.

107
00:09:28,722 --> 00:09:30,679
Who are you?

108
00:09:34,561 --> 00:09:36,969
Jin!

109
00:09:46,406 --> 00:09:49,194
Jin!

110
00:10:21,358 --> 00:10:23,315
All right, guys. Thanks.

111
00:10:33,370 --> 00:10:35,943
Excuse me, Mr Widmore?

112
00:10:35,998 --> 00:10:38,405
- Yes?
- I'm Sun Kwon.

113
00:10:38,458 --> 00:10:42,456
Mr Paik's daughter. I'm the
managing director of Paik Industries.

114
00:10:42,504 --> 00:10:44,960
Yes, of course. How is your father?

115
00:10:45,007 --> 00:10:46,750
Excellent, thank you.

116
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:51,213
Quite the golfer. I believe I owe him
dinner after our last game.

117
00:10:53,182 --> 00:10:56,218
Are you really going to pretend
you don't know who I am?

118
00:10:57,269 --> 00:10:59,890
I don't know what you're
talking about, Ms Kwon.

119
00:10:59,938 --> 00:11:02,180
Yes, you do know, Mr Widmore.

120
00:11:02,232 --> 00:11:06,312
Just like you know we've been lying
all this time about where we were...

121
00:11:06,904 --> 00:11:08,861
...and what happened to us there.

122
00:11:11,825 --> 00:11:14,032
You and I have common interests.

123
00:11:17,206 --> 00:11:20,788
When you're ready
to discuss them, call me.

124
00:11:23,795 --> 00:11:28,790
As you know, we're not the only ones
who left the island.

125
00:11:32,971 --> 00:11:34,051
Ms Kwon.

126
00:11:36,308 --> 00:11:38,217
Why would you want to help me?

127
00:11:49,947 --> 00:11:52,272
Go down lower. We have to go find Jin.

128
00:11:52,324 --> 00:11:55,907
- Sun, there's nobody down there.
- We can't see anything from here!

129
00:11:55,953 --> 00:11:58,574
We didn't get enough fuel!
We can't go back!

130
00:11:58,622 --> 00:12:00,947
- Sun, I'm so sorry.
- He's down there!

131
00:12:00,999 --> 00:12:04,534
I know he's down there!
No, I'm not leaving him!

132
00:12:04,586 --> 00:12:07,421
- Sun!
- No, we're not leaving him!

133
00:12:07,464 --> 00:12:11,462
- We're not! Turn back around!
- Sun! It's gone.

134
00:12:15,013 --> 00:12:16,424
He's gone.

135
00:12:29,987 --> 00:12:33,652
Lapidus! Fly us back to the island.

136
00:12:34,449 --> 00:12:35,648
You got it.

137
00:12:37,661 --> 00:12:39,036
No!

138
00:12:40,038 --> 00:12:41,948
No! No!

139
00:12:43,041 --> 00:12:44,619
No!

140
00:12:46,295 --> 00:12:47,575
Why?

141
00:12:47,629 --> 00:12:49,289
Why what?

142
00:12:49,339 --> 00:12:52,673
Why did you kill him when you knew
it would destroy the boat?

143
00:12:52,718 --> 00:12:54,841
I really wasn't thinking straight.

144
00:12:56,138 --> 00:12:57,549
Sometimes...

145
00:12:59,850 --> 00:13:02,305
...good command decisions
get compromised

146
00:13:02,352 --> 00:13:04,179
by bad emotional responses.

147
00:13:07,149 --> 00:13:10,981
I'm sure you'll do a much better job
of separating the two than I ever did.

148
00:13:17,743 --> 00:13:19,071
What are you doing?

149
00:13:22,539 --> 00:13:24,283
I asked you a question!

150
00:13:24,333 --> 00:13:25,910
If I were you I'd duck.

151
00:13:42,476 --> 00:13:44,053
I'd better change.

152
00:14:16,301 --> 00:14:18,045
Nice day for a swim.

153
00:14:21,223 --> 00:14:23,216
What are you doing here?

154
00:14:23,267 --> 00:14:25,390
Decided to take a dip.

155
00:14:29,356 --> 00:14:31,230
What you celebrating?

156
00:14:32,317 --> 00:14:34,061
I'm not celebrating.

157
00:14:50,002 --> 00:14:51,460
Is that our boat?

158
00:14:52,087 --> 00:14:53,961
It was.

159
00:15:08,937 --> 00:15:10,562
What's that for?

160
00:15:10,606 --> 00:15:12,314
I'm going somewhere cold.

161
00:15:13,609 --> 00:15:14,854
And where is mine?

162
00:15:16,069 --> 00:15:18,821
You don't need one because
you're not going with me.

163
00:15:18,864 --> 00:15:21,900
- Yes, I am going with you.
- No, John, you're not.

164
00:15:21,950 --> 00:15:24,109
Jacob told me what we had to do...

165
00:15:24,161 --> 00:15:26,996
He told you what to do
but he didn't tell you how

166
00:15:27,039 --> 00:15:29,909
because he wants me to suffer
the consequences.

167
00:15:30,667 --> 00:15:31,912
What consequences?

168
00:15:38,550 --> 00:15:41,337
Whoever moves the island
can never come back.

169
00:15:44,515 --> 00:15:47,599
So I'd like you to get on the elevator,
John, and go back up.

170
00:15:47,643 --> 00:15:50,893
Richard and my people will wait
two miles east of the Orchid.

171
00:15:52,856 --> 00:15:56,984
- Waiting for me?
- Ready, willing and able

172
00:15:57,027 --> 00:15:59,435
to share what they know...

173
00:16:02,741 --> 00:16:05,446
...and then they will follow
your every word.

174
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:09,455
Goodbye, John.

175
00:16:14,711 --> 00:16:17,119
I'm sorry I made your life so miserable.

176
00:16:27,975 --> 00:16:29,350
What do I tell them to do?

177
00:16:35,190 --> 00:16:38,393
You'll find your way, John.
You always do.

178
00:17:17,399 --> 00:17:18,774
Hello, John.

179
00:17:27,576 --> 00:17:29,236
Welcome home.

180
00:19:29,907 --> 00:19:32,777
I hope you're happy now, Jacob.

181
00:20:45,357 --> 00:20:46,816
What is that?

182
00:21:57,846 --> 00:21:59,554
Where's the island?

183
00:22:00,015 --> 00:22:01,758
Where's the island?!

184
00:22:08,065 --> 00:22:11,185
- Where the hell's the island?!
- It's gone.

185
00:22:17,324 --> 00:22:19,862
Where the hell am I gonna land
this thing?

186
00:22:19,910 --> 00:22:23,361
There's another smaller island
close by they took us to.

187
00:22:23,413 --> 00:22:28,075
I got news for you, doc! There's nothing
but water in every direction.

188
00:22:30,712 --> 00:22:34,295
Doesn't matter now.
That's it, people, we're out of fuel!

189
00:22:44,434 --> 00:22:46,723
Get your life vests on! We're going in!

190
00:22:56,113 --> 00:22:57,737
Brace yourselves!

191
00:23:01,660 --> 00:23:03,285
Desmond, the life raft!

192
00:23:04,371 --> 00:23:06,031
Hold on!

193
00:23:44,077 --> 00:23:47,493
- Sayid, are you all right?
- Yes. Jack?

194
00:23:47,539 --> 00:23:49,995
- Sun? Where's Desmond?
- Get the baby.

195
00:23:50,042 --> 00:23:51,500
I got it.

196
00:23:59,051 --> 00:24:00,675
Desmond!

197
00:24:03,555 --> 00:24:06,177
Jack, give me a hand!

198
00:24:11,146 --> 00:24:13,388
Get him to the raft,
get him to the raft!

199
00:24:21,323 --> 00:24:22,402
Get him up.

200
00:24:22,449 --> 00:24:25,616
- We gotta get him up.
- Is he breathing? Is he breathing?

201
00:24:37,297 --> 00:24:38,377
Oh, my God.

202
00:24:42,052 --> 00:24:43,630
Oh, come on, Desmond.

203
00:24:59,486 --> 00:25:01,562
One, two, three, four...

204
00:25:04,783 --> 00:25:05,862
Yeah.

205
00:25:07,536 --> 00:25:08,947
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

206
00:25:10,706 --> 00:25:12,164
Yeah, you're all right.

207
00:25:14,293 --> 00:25:15,407
Sit up.

208
00:25:17,963 --> 00:25:20,205
You're all right. That's it.

209
00:25:35,522 --> 00:25:37,064
It's OK.

210
00:25:37,524 --> 00:25:40,146
It's OK. We're alive.

211
00:26:19,775 --> 00:26:20,937
Hello?

212
00:26:23,695 --> 00:26:25,071
Hello, who's there?

213
00:26:54,810 --> 00:26:56,008
Don't move.

214
00:26:57,187 --> 00:26:59,144
Don't you touch my son!

215
00:27:09,825 --> 00:27:11,153
Claire.

216
00:27:14,705 --> 00:27:18,323
- How did you?
- Don't bring him back, Kate.

217
00:27:23,130 --> 00:27:26,499
Don't you dare bring him back.

218
00:28:10,427 --> 00:28:11,838
I'm sorry.

219
00:28:17,434 --> 00:28:18,976
I'm sorry.

220
00:28:30,906 --> 00:28:32,186
Is he OK?

221
00:28:34,827 --> 00:28:36,237
He's fine.

222
00:28:37,913 --> 00:28:39,324
It's a miracle.

223
00:28:44,837 --> 00:28:46,710
I can't believe he did it.

224
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:48,919
Who did what?

225
00:28:49,675 --> 00:28:51,085
Locke.

226
00:28:52,386 --> 00:28:54,177
He moved the island.

227
00:28:55,180 --> 00:28:56,674
No, he didn't.

228
00:28:59,434 --> 00:29:00,977
Oh, really?

229
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:04,604
'Cause one minute it was there,
the next it was gone,

230
00:29:04,648 --> 00:29:08,266
so, unless we, like,
overlooked it, dude,

231
00:29:08,318 --> 00:29:09,861
that's exactly what he did.

232
00:29:11,405 --> 00:29:15,616
But, if you've got another explanation,
man, I'd love to hear it.

233
00:29:24,251 --> 00:29:25,662
God Almighty.

234
00:29:27,379 --> 00:29:28,873
There's a boat.

235
00:29:31,216 --> 00:29:32,627
There's a boat out there!

236
00:29:35,137 --> 00:29:36,251
Hey!

237
00:29:36,305 --> 00:29:39,424
- There's a boat! You see it?
- Hey!

238
00:29:39,475 --> 00:29:42,429
- Hey! Over here!
- Does it see us?

239
00:29:42,478 --> 00:29:44,470
I think it does.

240
00:29:44,521 --> 00:29:46,430
- Hey!
- Hey!

241
00:29:47,024 --> 00:29:48,103
Is it turning?

242
00:29:49,151 --> 00:29:52,734
It's turning! Hey! Hey!

243
00:29:52,779 --> 00:29:54,404
We're gonna have to lie.

244
00:29:57,659 --> 00:30:00,530
- What?
- We're gonna have to lie.

245
00:30:02,331 --> 00:30:05,782
- Lie about what?
- Everything. All of it.

246
00:30:05,834 --> 00:30:08,586
Every moment since we crashed
on the island.

247
00:30:11,715 --> 00:30:14,288
Jack, now I know I'm new to this group,

248
00:30:14,343 --> 00:30:18,008
but isn't this the place where everybody
jumps and hugs each other?

249
00:30:18,055 --> 00:30:21,673
Your freighter, those men came
to the island to kill all of us.

250
00:30:23,268 --> 00:30:26,020
Our plane was discovered
on the bottom of the ocean.

251
00:30:26,063 --> 00:30:29,977
Someone put it there, someone who
wants everyone to think we're dead.

252
00:30:31,527 --> 00:30:35,987
So what do you think will happen to us
when we tell them that wasn't our plane?

253
00:30:38,158 --> 00:30:41,444
What do you think will happen
to the people we left behind?

254
00:30:45,624 --> 00:30:47,249
Jack, we can't.

255
00:30:48,877 --> 00:30:50,870
We can't pull it off.

256
00:30:53,715 --> 00:30:55,708
Just let me do the talking.

257
00:31:44,475 --> 00:31:45,933
Ms Widmore.

258
00:31:50,314 --> 00:31:53,065
Throw them a rope.
Take them around to the stern.

259
00:31:55,527 --> 00:31:57,152
Penny?

260
00:32:01,325 --> 00:32:02,570
Penny!

261
00:32:02,618 --> 00:32:04,076
Penny!

262
00:32:59,508 --> 00:33:01,216
Are you OK?

263
00:33:02,511 --> 00:33:04,302
I'm fine.

264
00:33:04,346 --> 00:33:05,626
I'm fine.

265
00:33:08,475 --> 00:33:09,934
How did you find me?

266
00:33:10,894 --> 00:33:12,519
Your phone call.

267
00:33:13,647 --> 00:33:16,933
I have a tracking station.

268
00:33:20,904 --> 00:33:22,529
I love you, Penny.

269
00:33:24,449 --> 00:33:26,608
And I'll never leave you again.

270
00:33:42,426 --> 00:33:45,178
This is Penny. This is... Kate.

271
00:33:45,220 --> 00:33:46,465
- And Aaron.
- Hi.

272
00:33:50,058 --> 00:33:52,894
This is Sun. Sayid.

273
00:33:52,936 --> 00:33:54,347
- Hurley.
- Hi.

274
00:33:55,522 --> 00:33:56,933
Frank.

275
00:33:58,942 --> 00:34:01,694
And Jack. Jack, this is Penny.

276
00:34:01,737 --> 00:34:03,397
It's nice to meet you, Penny.

277
00:34:03,447 --> 00:34:04,692
Hi.

278
00:34:06,783 --> 00:34:08,326
But we need to talk.

279
00:34:22,216 --> 00:34:24,754
What's this place called?

280
00:34:24,802 --> 00:34:26,296
Membata.

281
00:34:26,345 --> 00:34:28,053
Membata.

282
00:34:33,018 --> 00:34:34,892
Why are we doing this, dude?

283
00:34:34,937 --> 00:34:37,938
Sailing 3,000 miles to another island.

284
00:34:39,024 --> 00:34:41,729
Because it's the only way
to keep them safe.

285
00:34:51,662 --> 00:34:55,529
- How long till we'll hit land?
- Well, if the wind's not too brutal,

286
00:34:55,582 --> 00:34:56,697
eight, nine hours.

287
00:34:58,210 --> 00:35:01,294
Just long enough to give you
a nice, convincing sunburn.

288
00:35:01,338 --> 00:35:04,292
Well, it's been a pleasure, Frank.

289
00:35:04,341 --> 00:35:08,173
- Hope we never see each other again.
- Roger that, doc.

290
00:35:12,975 --> 00:35:14,683
Bye, sweetheart.

291
00:35:26,196 --> 00:35:28,023
You sure about this, brother?

292
00:35:30,450 --> 00:35:31,530
Are you sure?

293
00:35:34,121 --> 00:35:36,244
As long as I've got Penny...

294
00:35:37,624 --> 00:35:38,953
...I'll be fine.

295
00:35:41,128 --> 00:35:43,002
Don't let him find you, Desmond.

296
00:35:44,798 --> 00:35:47,372
I'll see you in another life, brother.

297
00:35:49,761 --> 00:35:50,841
Aye.

298
00:35:55,017 --> 00:35:56,262
All right.

299
00:35:57,603 --> 00:35:59,145
Let's go home.

300
00:39:25,686 --> 00:39:27,061
Hello, Jack.

301
00:39:30,107 --> 00:39:32,942
Sorry. Didn't mean to scare you.

302
00:39:35,988 --> 00:39:38,276
Did he tell you
that I was off the island?

303
00:39:42,202 --> 00:39:43,827
Yes, he did.

304
00:39:50,002 --> 00:39:51,710
When did you speak to him?

305
00:39:54,715 --> 00:39:56,292
About a month ago.

306
00:39:56,341 --> 00:39:57,670
And Kate?

307
00:39:59,303 --> 00:40:00,583
Yeah.

308
00:40:02,014 --> 00:40:04,053
Yeah, he came to see her too.

309
00:40:04,683 --> 00:40:06,308
And what did he say to you?

310
00:40:07,936 --> 00:40:09,561
He told me...

311
00:40:10,314 --> 00:40:12,639
...that after I left the island...

312
00:40:14,735 --> 00:40:17,107
...some very bad things happened.

313
00:40:20,282 --> 00:40:22,571
And he told me that it was my fault...

314
00:40:23,577 --> 00:40:25,071
...for leaving.

315
00:40:27,748 --> 00:40:30,037
And he said that I had to come back.

316
00:40:31,668 --> 00:40:34,586
Yes, I heard you've been flying
on passenger planes.

317
00:40:36,381 --> 00:40:38,670
Hoping that you'd crash.

318
00:40:40,761 --> 00:40:43,762
It's dark, Jack, very dark.

319
00:40:44,598 --> 00:40:46,804
Why are you here?

320
00:40:48,268 --> 00:40:51,684
I'm here to tell you that
the island won't let you come alone.

321
00:40:59,571 --> 00:41:02,027
All of you have to go back.

322
00:41:02,074 --> 00:41:03,651
Are you...

323
00:41:07,204 --> 00:41:09,695
Sayid, I don't even know
where Sayid is.

324
00:41:10,332 --> 00:41:11,743
Hurley...

325
00:41:12,376 --> 00:41:13,574
...is insane.

326
00:41:14,586 --> 00:41:16,579
Sun blames me for...

327
00:41:19,174 --> 00:41:20,799
And Kate...

328
00:41:23,595 --> 00:41:25,802
She won't even talk to me anymore.

329
00:41:26,348 --> 00:41:28,388
Perhaps I can help you with that.

330
00:41:31,937 --> 00:41:35,306
This is the way it has to be, Jack.
It's the only way.

331
00:41:37,860 --> 00:41:40,185
You have to do it together, all of you.

332
00:41:41,905 --> 00:41:43,234
How?

333
00:41:44,491 --> 00:41:47,029
I have a few ideas.

334
00:42:01,258 --> 00:42:02,503
Jack.

335
00:42:03,594 --> 00:42:05,337
I said all of you.

336
00:42:06,847 --> 00:42:08,721
We're gonna have to bring him too.
