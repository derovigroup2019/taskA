1
00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:01,985
Previously on 'Lost':

2
00:00:02,185 --> 00:00:03,830
I put Sayid and Desmond
on that chopper.

3
00:00:04,030 --> 00:00:04,775
It was my call.

4
00:00:04,975 --> 00:00:06,990
I'm going after it whether
they're on it or not.

5
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:09,440
Oh, my God.

6
00:00:11,410 --> 00:00:12,520
Lapidus!

7
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:13,420
<i>Yeah!</i>

8
00:00:13,595 --> 00:00:14,575
Where'd they go?

9
00:00:14,775 --> 00:00:16,163
They're up by some greenhouse,

10
00:00:16,363 --> 00:00:18,345
perched up there,
waitin' to snatch Linus.

11
00:00:18,545 --> 00:00:20,945
If you can move the island
whenever you wanted...

12
00:00:21,145 --> 00:00:23,645
...why didn't you just move it before
the psychos with guns got here?

13
00:00:24,045 --> 00:00:25,545
It's a measure of last resort.

14
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:26,925
You're gonna go into that greenhouse.

15
00:00:27,125 --> 00:00:29,565
<i>The elevator takes you down
to the actual Orchid Station.</i>

16
00:00:29,765 --> 00:00:32,085
I'm sorry, Ben, but maybe I missed
the part where you explained

17
00:00:32,285 --> 00:00:34,520
what I'm supposed to do about
the armed men inside.

18
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:37,075
How many times do I
have to tell you, John?

19
00:00:37,275 --> 00:00:39,180
I always have a plan.

20
00:00:40,490 --> 00:00:42,130
These aren't Jack or Sawyer.

21
00:00:42,330 --> 00:00:44,590
Whoever you are, come out now!

22
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:49,805
My name is Benjamin Linus.

23
00:00:50,005 --> 00:00:52,160
I believe you're looking for me.

24
00:00:53,650 --> 00:00:57,950
Ladies and gentlemen,
the survivors of Oceanic 815.

25
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:01,875
Is it possible there are
any other survivors...

26
00:01:02,075 --> 00:01:03,980
...from the crash
yet to be discovered?

27
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:06,650
No, absolutely not.

28
00:01:13,790 --> 00:01:15,510
Why did you call me, Jack?

29
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:22,100
I was hoping that you'd heard, that
maybe you'd go to the funeral.

30
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:25,190
Why would I go to the funeral?

31
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:29,060
- This is not gonna change...
- No, I'm sick...

32
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:30,475
.. of lying.

33
00:01:30,675 --> 00:01:31,995
I have to go.

34
00:01:32,195 --> 00:01:34,400
- He's gonna be wondering where I am...
- Don't.

35
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:39,310
We were not supposed to leave.

36
00:01:40,410 --> 00:01:42,110
Yes, we were.

37
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:45,480
Goodbye, Jack.

38
00:01:47,590 --> 00:01:49,370
We have to go back, Kate.

39
00:01:58,180 --> 00:01:59,920
We have to go back!

40
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:24,070
We have to go back?

41
00:02:25,630 --> 00:02:27,220
We have to go back?

42
00:02:28,550 --> 00:02:30,665
- Now hold on...
- Who do you think you are?

43
00:02:30,865 --> 00:02:32,433
You call me over and over again...

44
00:02:32,533 --> 00:02:34,950
for two days straight,
stoned on your pills!

45
00:02:35,710 --> 00:02:39,030
And then you show up here with an
obituary for Jeremy Bentham.

46
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:46,500
When he came to me and I heard what
he had to say, I knew he was crazy.

47
00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:49,055
But you...

48
00:02:49,255 --> 00:02:50,635
you believed him.

49
00:02:50,735 --> 00:02:51,535
Yes.

50
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:52,785
Him, of all people.

51
00:02:52,885 --> 00:02:55,840
Yes, Kate, I did, because he said
that that was the only way

52
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:00,430
that I could keep you safe...
You and Aaron.

53
00:03:04,770 --> 00:03:06,990
Don't you say his name.

54
00:03:10,110 --> 00:03:13,355
I still have to explain to him why
you are not there to read to him,

55
00:03:13,455 --> 00:03:15,190
so don't you say his name!

56
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,170
I'm sorry.

57
00:03:26,230 --> 00:03:29,795
I've spent the last three years trying
to forget all the horrible things

58
00:03:29,995 --> 00:03:32,140
that happened on the day that we left.

59
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:38,530
How dare you ask me to go back?

60
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:13,880
<i>You sure we're going the right way?</i>

61
00:04:14,310 --> 00:04:16,190
Lapidus said they were headed northeast.

62
00:04:17,610 --> 00:04:18,735
You might wanna slow down a little...

63
00:04:18,935 --> 00:04:20,185
...'cause you look like you're
about to keel over, Doc.

64
00:04:20,285 --> 00:04:20,975
I'm fine.

65
00:04:21,075 --> 00:04:21,775
Of course you're fine.

66
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:23,610
You're always fine.

67
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:27,875
Is this it?

68
00:04:28,775 --> 00:04:30,460
I don't know.

69
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:33,260
So what's the plan, Sundance?

70
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:37,150
The plan is we wait till--

71
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:44,690
- Hugo?
- Sawyer!

72
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:49,735
You all right?

73
00:04:49,935 --> 00:04:50,795
Dude, you came back.

74
00:04:50,995 --> 00:04:52,590
How'd you know where I was?

75
00:04:57,540 --> 00:04:59,060
It's good to see you, Hurley.

76
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:01,620
Yeah.

77
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:04,150
Yeah, man. You, too.

78
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:08,350
So where the hell is he?

79
00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:31,700
Locke!

80
00:05:36,270 --> 00:05:37,540
Hello, Jack.

81
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:58,120
There's enough C4 here to blow
up a bloody aircraft carrier.

82
00:06:00,370 --> 00:06:01,870
When I was in the army.

83
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:09,975
I did six months explosive ordnance
disposal, which, as the saying goes,

84
00:06:10,675 --> 00:06:13,655
is just enough time to learn
how to blow yourself up.

85
00:06:14,055 --> 00:06:15,640
Is it on a timer?

86
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,330
And why hasn't it gone off yet?

87
00:06:17,630 --> 00:06:19,110
This is a-a radio receiver.

88
00:06:19,610 --> 00:06:21,060
It's like a walkie- talkie.

89
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:22,990
You send it a signal, and, uh...

90
00:06:23,690 --> 00:06:26,220
it--it triggers the bomb remotely.

91
00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:30,140
So can we...

92
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:31,800
turn off?

93
00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:36,050
This is a...

94
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:38,600
This is a trip wire.

95
00:06:38,710 --> 00:06:39,650
Move it, and...

96
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:41,495
Boom.

97
00:06:41,695 --> 00:06:43,015
This is dummy wiring.

98
00:06:43,215 --> 00:06:45,375
If you cut the wrong one,
Boom.

99
00:06:45,775 --> 00:06:48,290
This is multiple firing systems.

100
00:06:48,490 --> 00:06:50,455
You disable one, and the next one.

101
00:06:50,555 --> 00:06:51,865
Boom.

102
00:06:52,665 --> 00:06:54,260
Um, this...

103
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:56,345
battery's the power source.

104
00:06:56,445 --> 00:06:58,210
- If you disconnect it.
- Boom.

105
00:07:23,050 --> 00:07:24,405
What are you doing in here?

106
00:07:25,205 --> 00:07:27,870
There's a--a Dharma
station below us, and,

107
00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:30,340
um, I'm looking for a way to get in.

108
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:32,070
You get in and do what?

109
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:36,145
Hugo, James, would you mind if I
spoke to Jack alone?

110
00:07:37,845 --> 00:07:38,755
Don't bother.

111
00:07:38,855 --> 00:07:40,295
We just came back for Hurley.

112
00:07:40,395 --> 00:07:41,480
Let's go.

113
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:43,385
Jack, you need to hear
what I have to say...

114
00:07:43,585 --> 00:07:46,585
What I need to do is to
walk back to the chopper,

115
00:07:47,285 --> 00:07:50,485
get on it, and get the rest
of our people off this island.

116
00:07:50,685 --> 00:07:53,675
Uh, dude, probably not the
best idea right now.

117
00:07:54,375 --> 00:07:56,245
Those Rambo guys are taking
Ben to that helicopter.

118
00:07:56,445 --> 00:07:59,170
He surrendered himself to 'em
about an hour ago.

119
00:08:02,650 --> 00:08:04,350
Now why the hell would he do that?

120
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:15,430
So tell me something, Ben.

121
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:19,530
What is it that makes you
so important, hmm?

122
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:25,770
I'm curious.

123
00:08:27,770 --> 00:08:28,790
I'm curious as to why...

124
00:08:28,990 --> 00:08:32,465
...Mr. Widmore would pay me so much
money just to come out here...

125
00:08:32,565 --> 00:08:35,330
...and capture you and
bring you back alive.

126
00:08:37,310 --> 00:08:39,440
Charles Widmore told
you to kill my daughter?

127
00:08:45,367 --> 00:08:46,267
Hey!

128
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:49,240
How'd he get the toolbox?

129
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:51,960
Damn.

130
00:08:55,730 --> 00:08:57,415
Who gave you the toolbox, Frank?

131
00:08:58,115 --> 00:08:59,700
- Well...
- Hey!

132
00:09:07,690 --> 00:09:09,170
You're good right there.

133
00:09:11,410 --> 00:09:12,800
Who are you?

134
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:15,220
I'm Kate.

135
00:09:16,010 --> 00:09:18,235
I'm one of the passengers of flight 815.

136
00:09:19,435 --> 00:09:20,660
Why are you running?

137
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:22,150
I'm being chased.

138
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:24,700
By his people.

139
00:09:27,090 --> 00:09:28,010
Kocol.

140
00:09:28,210 --> 00:09:29,075
Lacour.

141
00:09:29,275 --> 00:09:30,740
Redfern on flank.

142
00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:36,380
Come here.

143
00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:37,820
Get on your knees.

144
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:40,590
Hands above your heads, both of you.

145
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:25,500
Now! Spray it!

146
00:10:49,490 --> 00:10:51,030
Ben, stay close.

147
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:53,610
Run. Run!

148
00:10:56,710 --> 00:10:57,960
Grenade!

149
00:11:27,090 --> 00:11:28,850
Get up. Come on.

150
00:12:57,010 --> 00:12:58,645
Thank you for coming, Richard.

151
00:12:59,645 --> 00:13:00,890
My pleasure.

152
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:05,180
Could you cut me free, Kate?

153
00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:15,410
What was the arrangement?

154
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:20,030
They, uh, help us free you,
and we let 'em off the island.

155
00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:24,325
Fair enough.

156
00:13:24,825 --> 00:13:26,390
The helicopter is yours.

157
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:30,930
You and Sayid have a safe journey back.

158
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:35,000
So we can go?

159
00:13:36,570 --> 00:13:38,130
Off the island?

160
00:13:38,630 --> 00:13:39,920
That's it?

161
00:13:43,350 --> 00:13:44,640
That's it.

162
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:53,590
Thank you, miss.

163
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,560
Are you Hurley?

164
00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:00,485
Yeah.

165
00:14:01,385 --> 00:14:02,840
Are you dangerous?

166
00:14:05,590 --> 00:14:07,005
I'm sorry.
Do I know you?

167
00:14:07,205 --> 00:14:09,820
No, you don't know me...

168
00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:11,680
...but you know my grandson.

169
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:16,397
Now we've traveled all
the way across country...

170
00:14:16,497 --> 00:14:18,270
just so he could see you.

171
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:23,455
I need to know if you're gonna
do anything crazy.

172
00:14:24,655 --> 00:14:26,260
I won't do anything crazy.

173
00:14:54,690 --> 00:14:56,020
Hey, Walt.

174
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:58,260
Hey, Hurley.

175
00:15:02,010 --> 00:15:03,580
You're getting big, dude.

176
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:12,145
You know, when you came back,

177
00:15:12,845 --> 00:15:15,220
I was waiting for one of you to
come see me, but...

178
00:15:16,083 --> 00:15:17,383
nobody did.

179
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:21,090
I'm sorry.

180
00:15:25,310 --> 00:15:27,030
Do you know who did come see me?

181
00:15:28,590 --> 00:15:29,980
Jeremy Bentham.

182
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:34,350
I don't understand why you're all lying.

183
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:48,190
We're lying...

184
00:15:49,580 --> 00:15:52,620
because it's the only way to protect
everyone that didn't come back.

185
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:56,910
Like my dad?

186
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:01,390
Like your dad, yeah.

187
00:16:27,370 --> 00:16:29,340
What the hell they talkin'
about in there, anyway?

188
00:16:30,730 --> 00:16:32,400
I don't know. Leader stuff?

189
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:37,510
Where'd you get that?

190
00:16:37,710 --> 00:16:39,730
Came from a box Ben dug up
out of the ground.

191
00:16:40,430 --> 00:16:41,550
They're good.

192
00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:48,800
Thanks for coming back for me.

193
00:16:50,590 --> 00:16:52,330
Ah, you got it.

194
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:55,270
Claire and the baby are okay?

195
00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:04,390
What did you wanna talk
to me about, John?

196
00:17:06,940 --> 00:17:10,490
I want you to...reconsider
leaving the island, Jack.

197
00:17:10,790 --> 00:17:12,400
I would like you to stay.

198
00:17:14,030 --> 00:17:15,395
You'd like me to stay.

199
00:17:15,495 --> 00:17:17,710
Yeah, that's right.

200
00:17:18,710 --> 00:17:21,480
You threw a knife into the
back of an unarmed woman.

201
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:24,875
You led half of our people across the
island and got most of them killed.

202
00:17:24,975 --> 00:17:28,100
Well, Jack, you put a gun to my
head and you pulled the trigger.

203
00:17:31,310 --> 00:17:33,970
I was hoping we could let
bygones be bygones.

204
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:37,020
Well, I'll tell you what.

205
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:41,495
You stay here in your little greenhouse,
but the rest of us are going home.

206
00:17:41,595 --> 00:17:42,910
But you're not supposed to go home.

207
00:17:43,010 --> 00:17:44,850
And what am I
supposed to do?

208
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:47,730
Oh, I think I remember.

209
00:17:47,830 --> 00:17:50,230
What was it that you said on the way
out to the hatch?

210
00:17:51,030 --> 00:17:53,655
That crashing here was our destiny?

211
00:17:53,855 --> 00:17:55,525
You know, Jack.

212
00:17:55,725 --> 00:17:58,085
You know that you're here for a reason.

213
00:17:58,185 --> 00:17:59,515
You know it.

214
00:18:00,515 --> 00:18:02,680
And if you leave this place...

215
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:08,620
...that knowledge is gonna eat you alive
from the inside out...

216
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:12,550
...until you decide to come back.

217
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:16,105
Goodbye, John.

218
00:18:17,405 --> 00:18:18,960
You're gonna have to lie.

219
00:18:21,460 --> 00:18:22,610
Excuse me?

220
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:27,650
If you have to go, then you have
to lie about everything.

221
00:18:31,010 --> 00:18:33,660
Everything that happened
since we got to the island.

222
00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:39,210
It's the only way to protect it.

223
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:43,045
It's an island, John.

224
00:18:43,245 --> 00:18:45,120
No one needs to protect it.

225
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:47,770
It's not an island.

226
00:18:49,430 --> 00:18:51,350
It's a place where miracles happen.

227
00:18:53,430 --> 00:18:55,229
And... and... if you... if
you don't believe that, Jack,

228
00:18:55,329 --> 00:18:56,390
if you can't believe that,

229
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:01,300
just wait till you see
what I'm about to do.

230
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:07,480
There's no such thing as miracles.

231
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:10,910
Well.

232
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:15,290
We'll just have to see
which one of us is right.

233
00:19:19,590 --> 00:19:21,220
Am I interrupting?

234
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:27,815
Nice to see you, too, Jack.

235
00:19:29,215 --> 00:19:30,475
Couldn't find the anthiums, could you?

236
00:19:30,575 --> 00:19:32,070
I don't know what they look like.

237
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:41,750
What are you doing?

238
00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:46,655
Didn't you tell him?

239
00:19:47,855 --> 00:19:49,130
I tried.

240
00:19:51,290 --> 00:19:53,525
Sayid and Kate are waiting for you
at the helicopter.

241
00:19:54,225 --> 00:19:55,765
I understand that your
people from the beach

242
00:19:55,865 --> 00:19:57,650
are being brought to the freighter
even as we speak.

243
00:19:58,050 --> 00:19:58,595
What?

244
00:19:58,695 --> 00:20:00,470
I'd love to fill you in on
everything you missed, Jack,

245
00:20:00,670 --> 00:20:02,915
but you, Hugo, James,
you need to get moving.

246
00:20:03,015 --> 00:20:06,213
If I were you, I'd want to be
on that boat within the hour.

247
00:20:08,470 --> 00:20:10,270
Goodbye, Jack.
Let's go.

248
00:20:14,650 --> 00:20:16,290
Lie to them, Jack.

249
00:20:18,090 --> 00:20:20,583
If you do it half as well
as you lie to yourself,

250
00:20:20,683 --> 00:20:22,050
they'll believe you.

251
00:20:47,420 --> 00:20:48,595
Michael?

252
00:20:48,795 --> 00:20:50,480
What's going on down there?

253
00:20:53,070 --> 00:20:54,565
Did you tell anybody?

254
00:20:54,865 --> 00:20:56,540
No, Michael. I... I didn't.

255
00:20:57,450 --> 00:20:58,490
Can you...

256
00:20:58,690 --> 00:20:59,890
t-- turn it off?

257
00:21:00,090 --> 00:21:01,755
It isn't even on yet.

258
00:21:01,955 --> 00:21:05,085
But, yeah, if what's in this tank
does what it's supposed to do,

259
00:21:06,285 --> 00:21:07,420
we're gonna be okay.

260
00:21:09,780 --> 00:21:10,980
Look, I'll send Jin upstairs.

261
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:12,998
There's no need for him to
be down there with me...

262
00:21:13,098 --> 00:21:14,640
when he can be up here with you.

263
00:21:16,930 --> 00:21:18,380
I'm pregnant.

264
00:21:27,510 --> 00:21:28,890
Congratulations, Sun.

265
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:39,850
You're gonna what?

266
00:21:40,090 --> 00:21:41,150
Freeze it.

267
00:21:42,180 --> 00:21:43,615
This is liquid nitrogen.

268
00:21:43,815 --> 00:21:45,460
We use it in the refrigeration hold.

269
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,780
The bomb needs a charge from the
battery to detonate, right?

270
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:53,585
And the battery runs on
a... a chemical reaction.

271
00:21:54,085 --> 00:21:55,100
I spray the battery.

272
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:56,740
I can keep it cold.

273
00:21:57,140 --> 00:21:58,330
No reaction.

274
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:01,160
And what's the catch?

275
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:04,390
The catch is we only have one canister.

276
00:22:04,590 --> 00:22:06,800
We use it up, we're right
back where we started.

277
00:22:08,370 --> 00:22:10,330
Well, shouldn't we save it
till the light turns red?

278
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:14,190
If we see that light turn red and
the battery's not already cold,

279
00:22:14,790 --> 00:22:16,920
that is the last thing
we will ever see.

280
00:22:17,230 --> 00:22:20,340
Either way, at least
we'll have a warning,

281
00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:22,075
buy ourselves some time.

282
00:22:22,475 --> 00:22:24,235
All right, um, freeze the battery.

283
00:22:25,035 --> 00:22:26,790
Jin, help me trace back these wires,

284
00:22:27,990 --> 00:22:29,910
make a list of where
each of them goes to.

285
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:46,060
Boat!

286
00:22:55,470 --> 00:22:56,380
Thank you.

287
00:22:56,660 --> 00:22:57,970
Did you get them all to the boat?

288
00:22:58,070 --> 00:22:58,970
Yeah, everybody's safe.

289
00:22:59,070 --> 00:22:59,920
Are they coming closer?

290
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:01,460
They fixed the engine, and
they're gonna get as close to

291
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:03,310
the island as they can
without hitting the reef,

292
00:23:03,590 --> 00:23:04,960
so the next trip shouldn't
take so long.

293
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:06,880
I'm just gonna get some water,
and I'll come back in a minute.

294
00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:08,595
Yeah, I'll get the next
group ready to go.

295
00:23:08,695 --> 00:23:09,500
Thank you.

296
00:23:09,580 --> 00:23:11,080
- Dan!
- Yeah?

297
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:13,220
Thanks for helping us.

298
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:15,260
Absolutely.

299
00:23:19,850 --> 00:23:21,120
Okay, let's go!

300
00:23:25,370 --> 00:23:27,740
Uh, who told you you
could eat those peanuts?

301
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:34,040
May... may I eat these peanuts?

302
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:36,720
I'm gonna keep my eye on you, shorty.

303
00:23:40,230 --> 00:23:41,290
Miles.

304
00:23:42,550 --> 00:23:43,790
Somethin' wrong with your neck?

305
00:23:44,090 --> 00:23:45,330
Follow me, please.

306
00:23:45,550 --> 00:23:46,770
Dan, you're back.

307
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:48,920
What's wrong?

308
00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:51,800
I'm leaving in ten minutes to take the
next group of people to the freighter.

309
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:55,540
You need to make see that you're
with me on that raft, all right?

310
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:57,710
Well, don't worry about me,
'cause I'm gonna stay.

311
00:23:58,210 --> 00:24:01,350
Miles, no, uh, uh, I don't think
I'm getting across the...

312
00:24:01,450 --> 00:24:02,825
...direness of the circumstance.

313
00:24:02,925 --> 00:24:05,900
Oh, no, you're very dire,
but I'm still gonna stay.

314
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:08,865
Hey, ten minutes.

315
00:24:08,965 --> 00:24:09,665
Yep.

316
00:24:12,220 --> 00:24:13,910
I'm surprised you wanna leave.

317
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:17,030
Sorry?

318
00:24:17,810 --> 00:24:18,870
It's just weird, you know.

319
00:24:18,970 --> 00:24:21,180
After all that time you spent
trying to get back here.

320
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:25,460
What do you mean,
'get back here'?

321
00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:30,590
What do I mean?

322
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:53,410
How deep is the station?

323
00:24:57,490 --> 00:24:58,710
Deep.

324
00:25:31,890 --> 00:25:33,380
Is this the magic box?

325
00:25:35,750 --> 00:25:37,400
No, John, it's not.

326
00:25:45,670 --> 00:25:47,025
What is all this stuff for?

327
00:25:47,225 --> 00:25:49,650
Same things that all the
Dharma stations are for.

328
00:25:50,710 --> 00:25:52,170
Silly experiments.

329
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:54,180
What kind of experiments?

330
00:25:54,570 --> 00:25:55,880
You know what, John?

331
00:25:58,250 --> 00:26:00,900
Why don't you watch this very
informative video

332
00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:04,390
that will answer some
of your questions?

333
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:08,030
And I'll take care of some business.

336
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:30,210
Hello.

337
00:26:30,410 --> 00:26:31,760
I'm Dr. Edgar Halliwax,

338
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:36,720
and this is the orientation film for
Station Six of the Dharma Initiative.

339
00:26:37,550 --> 00:26:40,466
<i>As you've no doubt
surmised, Station Six,</i>

340
00:26:40,566 --> 00:26:44,005
or 'The Orchid' is not
a botanical research unit.

341
00:26:45,380 --> 00:26:48,040
<i>The unique properties
of this island</i>

342
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:50,840
have created a kind
of Casimir effect,

343
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:54,034
allowing the Dharma
Initiative to conduct

344
00:26:54,134 --> 00:26:57,560
unique experiments in
both space and time.

345
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:03,500
This is the vault,

346
00:27:04,420 --> 00:27:07,930
constructed adjacent to a
pocket of what we believe to be

347
00:27:08,030 --> 00:27:11,110
negatively charged exotic matter.

348
00:27:12,510 --> 00:27:15,540
<i>Great care must be
taken to avoid</i>

349
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:19,350
leaving inorganic materials
inside the chamber.

350
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:23,365
<i>The electromagnetic energy
within the island</i>

351
00:27:23,465 --> 00:27:26,030
<i>can be highly volatile
and unpredictable.</i>

352
00:27:27,470 --> 00:27:30,790
Now for your own safety and the
safety of those around you,

353
00:27:31,460 --> 00:27:35,750
metallic objects must never
be placed within the vault.

354
00:27:40,750 --> 00:27:42,210
In our first demonstration,

355
00:27:42,410 --> 00:27:45,720
we will attempt to
shift the test subject

356
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:49,500
100 milliseconds ahead in
four-dimensional space.

357
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:51,810
For the briefest of moments,

358
00:27:51,910 --> 00:27:54,210
the animal will seem to disappear,

359
00:27:55,456 --> 00:27:56,856
but in reality--

360
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:15,470
Hey.

361
00:28:17,430 --> 00:28:19,840
Was he talking about what I
think he was talking about?

362
00:28:19,940 --> 00:28:22,570
If you mean time-traveling
bunnies, then yes.

363
00:28:25,470 --> 00:28:27,227
You do know that he
said specifically

364
00:28:27,327 --> 00:28:29,180
not to put anything
metal in here.

365
00:28:49,180 --> 00:28:50,560
You expecting someone?

366
00:28:53,910 --> 00:28:55,680
May I have my weapon back?

367
00:29:12,490 --> 00:29:13,690
<i>Sayid!</i>

368
00:29:14,900 --> 00:29:16,020
Kate!

369
00:29:20,250 --> 00:29:21,670
Good to see you, dude.

370
00:29:34,170 --> 00:29:36,250
He say somethin' to
tick you off, freckles?

371
00:29:36,700 --> 00:29:37,950
Didn't kill that one.

372
00:29:38,150 --> 00:29:39,630
Well, which one did you kill?

373
00:29:44,190 --> 00:29:45,140
Where's the baby?

374
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:47,680
He's with Sun, and they should
be at the freighter by now.

375
00:29:49,630 --> 00:29:50,730
Are you okay?

376
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:52,580
I am now.

377
00:29:56,360 --> 00:29:57,630
Hey, Kenny Rogers!

378
00:29:58,790 --> 00:30:00,790
What you trying to do
there, pick a lock?

379
00:30:01,390 --> 00:30:02,730
You got a better idea?

380
00:30:04,820 --> 00:30:05,890
Hacksaw.

381
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:08,130
For the handcuffs, right?

382
00:30:09,620 --> 00:30:10,320
Yeah...

383
00:30:14,260 --> 00:30:15,400
Okay.

384
00:30:16,540 --> 00:30:17,585
- Take it easy.
- All right, all right.

385
00:30:17,685 --> 00:30:20,130
Sayid, how'd you get back?

386
00:30:20,310 --> 00:30:22,110
I took the zodiac from the freighter.

387
00:30:22,550 --> 00:30:23,650
Is it safe?

388
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:26,570
A body from the boat
washed up on the beach.

389
00:30:28,380 --> 00:30:29,840
It's safe now.

390
00:30:34,140 --> 00:30:35,200
All right!

391
00:30:35,590 --> 00:30:37,090
Let's get the hell outta here!

392
00:30:41,830 --> 00:30:43,120
Let's go, freckles.

393
00:30:44,070 --> 00:30:45,490
I've seen enough of this rock.

394
00:31:00,180 --> 00:31:01,620
After we drop everyone
off at the boat,

395
00:31:01,820 --> 00:31:03,310
we can come back and
look for Claire, right?

396
00:31:03,510 --> 00:31:04,750
Absolutely.

397
00:31:05,140 --> 00:31:07,190
Hands and feet inside the vehicle!

398
00:31:10,660 --> 00:31:12,160
Let's go for a ride!

399
00:32:15,390 --> 00:32:20,050
'Properties of this island have created
a kind of Casimir effect.'

400
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:22,060
I know you're down here, Ben.

401
00:32:24,340 --> 00:32:28,975
Crouching in the dark,
just waiting to take a shot at me.

402
00:32:29,975 --> 00:32:32,890
<i>This is the vault.</i>

403
00:32:33,910 --> 00:32:36,430
You better aim for the head, Ben!

404
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:43,520
NOt like your boyfriend who shot
me in the back like a coward!

405
00:32:47,490 --> 00:32:53,470
This body armor's, um, been known to
take a bullet or two in its time.

406
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:05,010
But before you take your shot, Ben,
let me tell you about this.

407
00:33:07,020 --> 00:33:08,370
See that?

408
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:13,450
I took out a bit of a-a
life insurance policy, Ben.

409
00:33:15,730 --> 00:33:22,110
It's a heart rate monitor, and it's
connected to a radio transmitter.

410
00:33:22,310 --> 00:33:25,580
Well, we call it a
'dead man's trigger', Ben.

411
00:33:27,670 --> 00:33:29,480
If my heart stops beating,

412
00:33:29,910 --> 00:33:34,360
it sends a little signal to
the 500 pounds of C4

413
00:33:34,710 --> 00:33:39,120
that I've got hardwired out
there on the freighter.

414
00:33:39,690 --> 00:33:42,950
<i>That'd kill a lot of
innocent people, Ben.</i>

415
00:33:43,580 --> 00:33:47,640
If you think I'm bluffing,
need I remind you of, uh,

416
00:33:48,740 --> 00:33:51,790
how your daughter looked
as she bled out?

417
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:55,210
<i>Face down in the grass?</i>

418
00:34:02,410 --> 00:34:03,700
Who the hell are you?

419
00:34:04,820 --> 00:34:09,420
My name is John Locke,
and I have no...

420
00:34:10,380 --> 00:34:12,460
...conflict with you.

421
00:34:14,310 --> 00:34:16,660
And neither do the
people on that boat.

422
00:34:18,250 --> 00:34:19,580
So,

423
00:34:20,610 --> 00:34:22,820
why don't you put your knife down?

424
00:34:26,160 --> 00:34:27,940
We can talk about this.

425
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:32,310
Well, John Locke.

426
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:37,100
I've never really been one for talk.

427
00:34:43,350 --> 00:34:45,240
You killed my daughter.

428
00:34:45,470 --> 00:34:46,910
You killed my daughter!

429
00:34:46,990 --> 00:34:47,965
Ben! Ben!
Ben, stop!

430
00:34:48,265 --> 00:34:49,330
No, no! Stop!

431
00:34:53,110 --> 00:34:55,270
Ben, what did you do?

432
00:35:01,150 --> 00:35:03,550
You just killed everybody on that boat.

433
00:35:08,270 --> 00:35:09,530
So?

434
00:35:12,590 --> 00:35:14,050
Hey, Charlotte!

435
00:35:15,220 --> 00:35:18,525
Listen, uh, I wanted to say before
you get on the boat, please...

436
00:35:18,825 --> 00:35:21,080
I'm gonna stay, Daniel.

437
00:35:22,940 --> 00:35:24,380
For now, anyway.

438
00:35:26,430 --> 00:35:27,800
Charlotte.

439
00:35:30,050 --> 00:35:32,550
There is no 'for now.'

440
00:35:32,750 --> 00:35:35,760
If you don't come with me,
'for now' could be forever.

441
00:35:37,420 --> 00:35:38,900
Nothing's forever.

442
00:35:42,330 --> 00:35:43,760
Why?

443
00:35:45,650 --> 00:35:48,534
Would it make any sense
if I told you

444
00:35:48,634 --> 00:35:51,220
I was still looking
for where I was born?

445
00:35:52,710 --> 00:35:54,050
N-no.

446
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:03,700
Goodbye, Daniel.

447
00:36:21,350 --> 00:36:22,490
Let me guess.

448
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:24,440
You're not coming.

449
00:36:24,730 --> 00:36:28,670
I promised I wouldn't leave until I got
everyone here safely off this island.

450
00:36:29,430 --> 00:36:30,430
Relax.

451
00:36:30,630 --> 00:36:32,420
I'll still be here when you get back.

452
00:36:34,070 --> 00:36:35,930
Right, right.

453
00:36:36,410 --> 00:36:37,990
When I get back.

454
00:36:46,870 --> 00:36:49,040
Okay. Everybody ready?

455
00:36:50,210 --> 00:36:51,700
Let's get started.

456
00:36:57,820 --> 00:36:59,190
Off we go.

457
00:37:06,310 --> 00:37:07,830
I think I might have something.

458
00:37:08,830 --> 00:37:10,040
Okay, so...

459
00:37:10,140 --> 00:37:12,510
So if I cut this wire,

460
00:37:13,180 --> 00:37:16,170
it should disconnect
the firing mechanisms.

461
00:37:18,180 --> 00:37:19,470
Stop!

462
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:24,200
No good.

463
00:37:25,330 --> 00:37:26,790
Damn it!

464
00:37:27,050 --> 00:37:28,880
I--I just don't know enough.

465
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:33,765
How do we even know your little
freezing trick's doing anything?

466
00:37:33,865 --> 00:37:36,350
We'll know if that light turns
red and we're still here.

467
00:37:38,610 --> 00:37:40,260
How much stuff do we have left?

468
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:45,940
We got a quarter tank.

469
00:37:47,490 --> 00:37:49,910
What happens if we can't
deactivate the bomb?

470
00:37:51,890 --> 00:37:54,370
We better get everybody
the hell off this boat.

471
00:38:19,770 --> 00:38:20,835
What's the matter?

472
00:38:21,035 --> 00:38:22,100
We're losing fuel.

473
00:38:23,460 --> 00:38:24,315
What?

474
00:38:24,515 --> 00:38:25,250
We're losing fuel!

475
00:38:25,450 --> 00:38:25,885
Look outside!

476
00:38:26,085 --> 00:38:27,540
Tell me if you see anything!

477
00:38:38,210 --> 00:38:39,260
We have a fuel leak!

478
00:38:39,460 --> 00:38:41,300
A bullet must have pierced the tank!

479
00:38:42,590 --> 00:38:44,180
We gotta find a place to set her down!

480
00:38:44,380 --> 00:38:45,080
No, don't land!

481
00:38:45,170 --> 00:38:47,830
- What?
- There's no fuel on the island!

482
00:38:48,030 --> 00:38:50,475
We've gotta get to the boat,
or this chopper's useless!

483
00:38:50,675 --> 00:38:52,660
I'm telling ya, I don't see the boat!

484
00:38:52,860 --> 00:38:54,450
Well, then keep looking!

485
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:07,280
We gotta get every ounce of extra
weight off this chopper now!

486
00:39:08,390 --> 00:39:11,030
Anything that's not bolted down,
toss it out!

487
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:28,910
Now what?

488
00:39:29,180 --> 00:39:30,980
Is that enough?
Can we make it?

489
00:39:33,380 --> 00:39:35,010
I'd feel a hell of a lot
better if we were

490
00:39:35,110 --> 00:39:36,390
a few hundred pounds lighter!

491
00:39:41,620 --> 00:39:43,075
Well, if we don't make it,
we're still close enough

492
00:39:43,275 --> 00:39:44,280
to ditch it on the beach.

493
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:46,850
Hey! Do not go back to the island!

494
00:39:47,240 --> 00:39:49,290
We might not have a choice, Doc.

495
00:39:53,310 --> 00:39:54,250
Hey.

496
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:08,810
Why are you telling me this?

497
00:40:24,780 --> 00:40:26,480
Just do it, freckles.

498
00:40:32,070 --> 00:40:33,480
Sawyer!

499
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:19,800
Excuse me, sir.
I'm sorry to bother you.

500
00:41:19,850 --> 00:41:21,245
But do you have the time,
please?

501
00:41:21,445 --> 00:41:22,340
Yeah.

502
00:41:22,540 --> 00:41:23,440
It's eight fif--

503
00:41:59,460 --> 00:42:00,371
Sayid.

504
00:42:00,521 --> 00:42:01,880
Hello, Hurley.

505
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:08,240
I think visiting hours
are over, dude.

506
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:10,290
This isn't a visit.

507
00:42:11,120 --> 00:42:12,950
I want you to come with me.

508
00:42:13,720 --> 00:42:15,050
Come with you where?

509
00:42:15,250 --> 00:42:16,655
Somewhere safe.

510
00:42:16,855 --> 00:42:18,610
And why would I go
anywhere with you?

511
00:42:19,110 --> 00:42:21,280
I haven't seen you in,
like, forever.

512
00:42:21,780 --> 00:42:23,720
Because circumstances have changed.

513
00:42:24,520 --> 00:42:26,170
What circumstances?

514
00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:28,690
Bentham's dead.

515
00:42:31,380 --> 00:42:32,345
What?

516
00:42:32,545 --> 00:42:34,120
Two days ago.

517
00:42:35,950 --> 00:42:36,905
What happened?

518
00:42:37,105 --> 00:42:38,685
They said it was suicide.

519
00:42:38,885 --> 00:42:41,080
What do you mean, they
'said' it was suicide?

520
00:42:41,810 --> 00:42:43,370
And why are you calling him 'Bentham'?

521
00:42:43,570 --> 00:42:45,700
- His name is...
- Don't say it.

522
00:42:49,150 --> 00:42:50,740
We're being watched.

523
00:42:51,380 --> 00:42:55,650
Dude, I've been having regular
conversations with dead people.

524
00:42:56,740 --> 00:42:58,555
The last thing I need now is paranoia.

525
00:42:59,455 --> 00:43:03,510
I just killed a man who's been perched
outside this facility for the last week.

526
00:43:04,850 --> 00:43:07,030
I'm finding paranoia keeps me alive.

527
00:43:11,660 --> 00:43:13,350
We're not going back, are we?

528
00:43:14,100 --> 00:43:15,420
No.

529
00:43:15,820 --> 00:43:17,460
Just somewhere safe.

530
00:43:22,370 --> 00:43:23,790
Okay then.

531
00:43:27,310 --> 00:43:28,970
Hold on a sec.

532
00:43:34,440 --> 00:43:36,340
Checkmate. Mr. Eko.

533
00:43:48,570 --> 00:43:49,980
Where's the freighter?

534
00:43:50,180 --> 00:43:52,010
I don't know.
I stayed on course.

535
00:43:52,210 --> 00:43:53,830
They must have it on the move again.

536
00:43:56,790 --> 00:43:58,270
How much fuel?

537
00:43:59,540 --> 00:44:03,210
Four, five minutes worth, unless
somebody else wants to jump.

538
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:12,880
As soon as we get to the boat,
we'll go back for him.

539
00:44:14,080 --> 00:44:14,768
Hey!

540
00:44:15,818 --> 00:44:17,975
There it is! The boat! I see it!

541
00:44:18,075 --> 00:44:19,490
Behind us!

542
00:44:41,850 --> 00:44:43,180
Ben, help me.

543
00:44:43,380 --> 00:44:45,960
If he dies, everybody on that boat dies.

544
00:44:48,020 --> 00:44:49,790
That's not my problem, John.

545
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:53,980
Hang on, man.
Hang on!

546
00:44:55,690 --> 00:44:57,290
Wherever you go.

547
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:02,360
Widmore.

548
00:45:06,070 --> 00:45:07,690
He'll find you.

549
00:45:11,510 --> 00:45:13,480
Not if I find him first.

550
00:45:18,110 --> 00:45:21,180
Hey...No.
Hey. Hey. Hey!

551
00:45:32,900 --> 00:45:34,370
You two need to go now.

552
00:45:34,570 --> 00:45:36,130
Get everybody off the boat.

553
00:45:36,330 --> 00:45:38,470
We have maybe five minutes
left in the tank.

554
00:45:39,420 --> 00:45:40,285
Go!

555
00:45:40,385 --> 00:45:42,530
You go.
Go.

556
00:45:44,430 --> 00:45:45,830
I stay.

557
00:46:20,570 --> 00:46:22,430
Oh, bloody hell.

558
00:46:28,900 --> 00:46:29,940
Don't land!

559
00:46:30,140 --> 00:46:31,490
You can't land!

560
00:46:31,690 --> 00:46:32,480
Don't land!

561
00:46:36,980 --> 00:46:38,610
Don't land!

562
00:46:40,040 --> 00:46:41,060
There's a bomb!

563
00:46:41,300 --> 00:46:42,810
There's a bomb!

564
00:46:43,110 --> 00:46:45,245
Get away! There's a bomb!
You can't land! Go back!

565
00:46:45,345 --> 00:46:46,405
Did he say 'bomb'?

566
00:46:46,605 --> 00:46:47,950
<i>Don't land!</i>

567
00:46:48,730 --> 00:46:49,635
What are you doing?

568
00:46:49,835 --> 00:46:51,695
I don't care what the
hell he's screaming!

569
00:46:51,895 --> 00:46:54,820
I'm flying on fumes!
I gotta put this bird down!

570
00:46:55,300 --> 00:46:57,610
No! Don't land!

571
00:47:08,950 --> 00:47:10,700
No! No! Look, you don't understand!

572
00:47:10,970 --> 00:47:13,550
Jin and Michael are doing everything
they can, but there's no time!

573
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:15,590
You've gotta get off the boat now!

574
00:47:17,250 --> 00:47:18,505
How long till we can fly again?

575
00:47:18,705 --> 00:47:20,230
Somebody patch the other hole
where the bullet came out!

576
00:47:20,430 --> 00:47:21,130
Give it to me.
I'll do it.

577
00:47:21,150 --> 00:47:21,850
Here!

578
00:47:21,965 --> 00:47:22,665
Somebody pump some gas!

579
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:23,660
I'll handle the fuel.

580
00:47:23,870 --> 00:47:25,720
Get that life raft right there! Come on!

581
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:27,350
Let's go!

582
00:47:30,050 --> 00:47:31,200
Hey, Sun!

583
00:47:31,900 --> 00:47:33,225
Sun! Where you going?

584
00:47:33,425 --> 00:47:34,610
We gotta go.
Jin's below with Michael.

585
00:47:34,810 --> 00:47:35,510
- I can't...
- No, no, there's no time!

586
00:47:35,675 --> 00:47:37,355
- There's no time. We have to go.
- I won't leave him!

587
00:47:37,555 --> 00:47:38,310
Okay.

588
00:47:38,510 --> 00:47:39,260
You get the baby on the chopper.

589
00:47:39,460 --> 00:47:40,860
I'll get Jin.
All right?

590
00:47:41,060 --> 00:47:42,315
Just keep pumping till I get it started!

591
00:47:42,515 --> 00:47:44,220
That'll be enough to
get us to the island.

592
00:47:54,420 --> 00:47:56,075
Jin, you gotta go.

593
00:47:56,275 --> 00:47:57,450
There's nothing more we can do, man.

594
00:47:57,650 --> 00:47:59,370
- No, I can find...
- Hey, come on.

595
00:47:59,570 --> 00:48:00,510
It's over.

596
00:48:00,710 --> 00:48:02,115
I'm almost out of this stuff.

597
00:48:02,315 --> 00:48:04,780
Listen, you are a father now.

598
00:48:05,260 --> 00:48:08,060
Get to your wife and
get her home.

599
00:48:09,080 --> 00:48:10,790
Thank you, Michael.

600
00:48:11,560 --> 00:48:13,075
You're welcome.

601
00:48:13,175 --> 00:48:14,620
Go.

602
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:23,865
Hey! Not yet!

603
00:48:24,065 --> 00:48:26,010
Your buddy said we got five minutes
as of three minutes ago.

604
00:48:26,210 --> 00:48:27,960
If you're going, this is it.
Let's go!

605
00:48:28,010 --> 00:48:29,970
- Kate! Come on!
- Jin's still inside!

606
00:48:33,800 --> 00:48:35,210
- Jin's still inside.
- Come on.

607
00:48:35,360 --> 00:48:37,285
- We can't leave him behind.
- Listen, I'm not leaving without you.

608
00:48:37,385 --> 00:48:39,050
We gotta get out of here now.

609
00:48:39,910 --> 00:48:41,290
Let's go!

610
00:48:50,320 --> 00:48:50,700
Give me a minute!

611
00:48:50,900 --> 00:48:51,820
No! Wait!

612
00:48:52,020 --> 00:48:53,190
Where's Jin?

613
00:49:07,290 --> 00:49:08,420
It's Jin!

614
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:13,400
No!

615
00:49:13,810 --> 00:49:14,955
Jin! Jin!

616
00:49:15,155 --> 00:49:16,405
We have to go back! Turn around!

617
00:49:16,605 --> 00:49:17,505
We can't do it!

618
00:49:17,705 --> 00:49:19,720
We have to! We need to go back!

619
00:49:37,260 --> 00:49:39,630
You can go now, Michael.

620
00:49:39,830 --> 00:49:41,450
Who are you?

621
00:49:45,100 --> 00:49:48,210
Jin!

622
00:49:57,130 --> 00:49:58,960
Jin!

623
00:50:05,040 --> 00:50:07,675
Go back lower.
We have to go find Jin!

624
00:50:07,875 --> 00:50:09,155
Sun, there's nobody down there!

625
00:50:09,355 --> 00:50:10,720
You can't see anything from here!

626
00:50:10,920 --> 00:50:11,941
We didn't get enough fuel!

627
00:50:12,070 --> 00:50:13,289
- Go lower. I know he's there!
- We can't go back!

628
00:50:13,639 --> 00:50:14,940
Sun, I'm... Sun, I'm so sorry.

629
00:50:15,040 --> 00:50:15,740
- He's down there!
- He's not...

630
00:50:16,020 --> 00:50:17,560
- I know he's down there!
- We gotta go!

631
00:50:17,730 --> 00:50:19,345
No! I'm not leaving him!

632
00:50:19,545 --> 00:50:21,920
- Can't get to him!
- No, we're not leaving him!

633
00:50:22,120 --> 00:50:23,660
We're not! Turn back around!

634
00:50:23,860 --> 00:50:25,075
Sun! Sun!

635
00:50:25,175 --> 00:50:26,780
It's gone!

636
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:31,410
He's gone.

637
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:46,630
Lapidus!

638
00:50:46,830 --> 00:50:48,630
Fly us back to the island.

639
00:50:49,570 --> 00:50:50,970
You got it.

640
00:50:52,460 --> 00:50:53,810
No!

641
00:50:54,600 --> 00:50:56,400
No! No!

642
00:50:57,955 --> 00:50:59,955
No!

643
00:51:29,316 --> 00:51:30,716
<i>Yes, of course</i>

644
00:51:31,050 --> 00:51:32,830
All right, guys.
Thanks.

645
00:51:42,980 --> 00:51:44,170
Excuse me.

646
00:51:44,370 --> 00:51:45,550
Mr. Widmore?

647
00:51:45,750 --> 00:51:46,775
Yes.

648
00:51:46,975 --> 00:51:48,210
I'm Sun Kwon.

649
00:51:48,410 --> 00:51:49,635
Mr. Paik's daughter.

650
00:51:49,835 --> 00:51:52,085
I'm the managing director
of Paik Industries.

651
00:51:52,285 --> 00:51:53,420
Yes, of course.

652
00:51:53,620 --> 00:51:54,715
How is your father?

653
00:51:54,815 --> 00:51:56,315
Excellent, thank you.

654
00:51:56,515 --> 00:51:57,765
Quite the golfer.

655
00:51:57,965 --> 00:52:00,430
I believe I owe him dinner
after our last game.

656
00:52:02,820 --> 00:52:05,480
Are you really going to pretend that
you don't know who I am?

657
00:52:07,070 --> 00:52:09,615
I'm afraid I don't know what you're
talking about, Ms. Kwon.

658
00:52:09,815 --> 00:52:11,880
Yes, you do know, Mr. Widmore.

659
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:14,655
Just like you know we've been
lying all this time about...

660
00:52:14,855 --> 00:52:18,510
...where we were and what
happened to us there.

661
00:52:21,420 --> 00:52:23,750
You and I have common interests.

662
00:52:26,470 --> 00:52:28,550
When you're ready to discuss them,

663
00:52:29,160 --> 00:52:30,580
call me.

664
00:52:33,660 --> 00:52:37,840
As you know, we're not the only
ones who left the island.

665
00:52:42,900 --> 00:52:44,170
Ms. Kwon?

666
00:52:45,890 --> 00:52:47,840
Why would you want to help me?

667
00:52:54,980 --> 00:52:56,270
Why?

668
00:52:56,940 --> 00:52:58,110
'Why' what?

669
00:52:58,310 --> 00:53:01,235
Why did you kill him when you knew
it would destroy the boat?

670
00:53:01,435 --> 00:53:03,660
Well, John, I really
wasn't thinking straight.

671
00:53:04,600 --> 00:53:05,920
Sometimes,

672
00:53:08,180 --> 00:53:12,010
good command decisions get compromised
by bad emotional responses.

673
00:53:15,850 --> 00:53:17,608
I'm sure you're gonna
do a much better job

674
00:53:17,708 --> 00:53:19,430
of separating the two than I ever did.

675
00:53:26,610 --> 00:53:28,000
What are you doing?

676
00:53:31,260 --> 00:53:32,950
I asked you a question!

677
00:53:33,160 --> 00:53:34,800
If I were you, I'd duck.

678
00:53:51,340 --> 00:53:52,790
I better change.

679
00:54:24,680 --> 00:54:26,430
Nice day for a swim.

680
00:54:29,870 --> 00:54:31,640
What are you doing here?

681
00:54:32,350 --> 00:54:33,910
Decided to take a dip.

682
00:54:38,110 --> 00:54:39,600
Whatcha celebratin'?

683
00:54:40,890 --> 00:54:42,550
I'm not celebrating.

684
00:54:58,540 --> 00:55:00,030
Is that our boat?

685
00:55:00,810 --> 00:55:02,350
It was.

686
00:55:18,050 --> 00:55:19,665
What's that for?

687
00:55:19,865 --> 00:55:21,330
I'm going somewhere cold.

688
00:55:22,590 --> 00:55:24,150
Then where is mine?

689
00:55:24,930 --> 00:55:27,075
You don't need one because
you're not going with me.

690
00:55:27,575 --> 00:55:28,995
Yes, I am going with you.

691
00:55:29,195 --> 00:55:30,510
No, John, you're not.

692
00:55:30,710 --> 00:55:32,460
Jacob told me what we had to do.

693
00:55:32,660 --> 00:55:33,660
You don't get to make
all the decisions--

694
00:55:33,725 --> 00:55:35,525
He told you what to do,
but he didn't tell you how,

695
00:55:35,725 --> 00:55:38,280
because he wants me to
suffer the consequences.

696
00:55:38,950 --> 00:55:40,460
What consequences?

697
00:55:47,450 --> 00:55:50,340
Whoever moves the island can
never come back.

698
00:55:53,320 --> 00:55:54,965
So I'd like you to get
on the elevator, John,

699
00:55:55,065 --> 00:55:56,065
and go back up.

700
00:55:56,465 --> 00:55:59,640
Richard and my people will be waiting
2 miles east of the Orchid.

701
00:56:01,570 --> 00:56:03,245
Waiting for me?

702
00:56:03,445 --> 00:56:07,730
Ready, willing and able to
share what they know.

703
00:56:11,590 --> 00:56:13,970
And then they will
follow your every word.

704
00:56:16,870 --> 00:56:18,550
Goodbye, John.

705
00:56:23,430 --> 00:56:26,200
I'm sorry I made your life so miserable.

706
00:56:36,710 --> 00:56:38,540
What do I tell 'em to do?

707
00:56:44,010 --> 00:56:45,770
You'll find your way, John.

708
00:56:46,070 --> 00:56:47,840
You always do.

709
00:57:26,340 --> 00:57:27,790
Hello, John.

710
00:57:36,220 --> 00:57:37,910
Welcome home.

711
00:59:37,150 --> 00:59:39,570
I hope you're happy now, Jacob.

712
01:00:52,800 --> 01:00:54,590
Now what is that?

713
01:02:05,330 --> 01:02:06,745
Where's the island?

714
01:02:07,645 --> 01:02:09,290
<i>Where's the island?</i>

715
01:02:15,300 --> 01:02:17,000
Where the hell's the island?

716
01:02:17,300 --> 01:02:18,730
It's gone.

717
01:02:25,130 --> 01:02:27,290
Where the hell am I
gonna land this thing?

718
01:02:27,490 --> 01:02:30,355
There's another smaller island
close by they took us to!

719
01:02:30,955 --> 01:02:34,680
I got news for ya, Doc. There's nothing
but water in every direction!

720
01:02:37,850 --> 01:02:39,535
Doesn't matter now.

721
01:02:39,735 --> 01:02:42,580
That's it, people! We're out of fuel!

722
01:02:52,010 --> 01:02:54,530
Get your life vests on! We're going in!

723
01:03:03,170 --> 01:03:04,490
Brace yourselves!

724
01:03:08,820 --> 01:03:10,740
Desmond! The life raft!

725
01:03:11,470 --> 01:03:14,470
Hold on!

726
01:03:43,760 --> 01:03:46,970
<i>- Where's Jack?</i>
<i>- Kate! Where is he?</i>

727
01:03:47,490 --> 01:03:50,130
<i>- Are you okay?</i>
<i>- Hurley, carry the baby.</i>

728
01:03:51,820 --> 01:03:53,080
<i>Sayid, are you all right?</i>

729
01:03:53,180 --> 01:03:55,060
<i>Yes! Jack!</i>

730
01:03:55,460 --> 01:03:56,590
<i>Where's Desmond?</i>

731
01:03:56,790 --> 01:03:59,600
- Get the baby.
- I got him.

732
01:04:06,790 --> 01:04:08,200
Desmond!

733
01:04:11,260 --> 01:04:13,450
Jack! Give me a hand!

734
01:04:18,370 --> 01:04:19,640
<i>Just get her in the raft.</i>

735
01:04:19,753 --> 01:04:20,953
Get her in the raft.</i></i>

736
01:04:28,590 --> 01:04:29,955
Get him up.

737
01:04:31,155 --> 01:04:31,955
Is he breathing?

738
01:04:32,050 --> 01:04:34,200
<i>- Oh, my god.</i>
<i>- Is he breathing?</i>

739
01:04:45,080 --> 01:04:46,220
Oh, my god.

740
01:04:49,710 --> 01:04:51,390
<i>Oh, come on, Desmond.</i>

741
01:05:09,934 --> 01:05:11,534
Yeah.
Yeah.

742
01:05:12,186 --> 01:05:13,186
<i>Yeah.</i>

743
01:05:18,610 --> 01:05:20,090
Yeah, you're all right.

744
01:05:20,690 --> 01:05:22,850
<i>You're all right, man.
You're okay.</i>

745
01:05:24,130 --> 01:05:25,495
Desmond. That's it.

746
01:05:25,695 --> 01:05:27,500
You're all right.
That's it.

747
01:05:45,880 --> 01:05:48,490
It's okay! It's okay!

748
01:05:49,690 --> 01:05:51,230
We're alive!

749
01:06:27,200 --> 01:06:28,460
Hello?

750
01:06:30,980 --> 01:06:32,580
Hello? Who's there?

751
01:07:02,180 --> 01:07:03,875
Don't move.

752
01:07:04,575 --> 01:07:06,360
Don't you touch my son!

753
01:07:17,320 --> 01:07:18,350
Claire?

754
01:07:21,970 --> 01:07:24,580
- How did you...?
- You can't bring him back, Kate.

755
01:07:30,720 --> 01:07:33,940
Don't you dare bring him back.

756
01:08:17,740 --> 01:08:19,040
I'm sorry.

757
01:08:24,830 --> 01:08:26,210
I'm sorry.

758
01:08:38,200 --> 01:08:39,545
<i>Is he okay?</i>

759
01:08:42,395 --> 01:08:43,720
He's fine.

760
01:08:45,150 --> 01:08:46,750
It's a miracle.

761
01:08:52,320 --> 01:08:53,940
I can't believe he did it.

762
01:08:55,110 --> 01:08:56,665
Who did what?

763
01:08:57,065 --> 01:08:58,320
Locke.

764
01:08:59,660 --> 01:09:01,140
He moved the island.

765
01:09:02,510 --> 01:09:03,980
No, he didn't.

766
01:09:06,780 --> 01:09:08,240
Oh, really?

767
01:09:08,840 --> 01:09:12,360
'Cause one minute it was there,
and the next it was gone, so...

768
01:09:13,460 --> 01:09:17,170
unless we, like, overlooked it, dude,
that's exactly what he did.

769
01:09:18,890 --> 01:09:22,240
But, if you've got another explanation,
man, I'd love to hear it.

770
01:09:31,660 --> 01:09:33,200
God almighty...

771
01:09:35,230 --> 01:09:36,630
There's a boat.

772
01:09:38,300 --> 01:09:40,050
There's a boat out there!

773
01:09:43,770 --> 01:09:45,335
There's a boat, do you see it?

774
01:09:45,435 --> 01:09:46,763
- Hey! Hey!
- Hey!

775
01:09:47,113 --> 01:09:48,095
Over here!

776
01:09:48,195 --> 01:09:49,550
<i>Does it see us?</i>

777
01:09:50,230 --> 01:09:51,710
<i>I think it does!</i>

778
01:09:51,826 --> 01:09:53,326
- Hey!
- Hey!

779
01:09:54,520 --> 01:09:56,095
<i>Is it turning?</i>

780
01:09:56,795 --> 01:09:58,020
<i>It's turning!</i>

781
01:09:58,144 --> 01:09:59,444
<i>Hey! Hey!</i>

782
01:10:00,044 --> 01:10:01,970
We're gonna have to lie.

783
01:10:05,080 --> 01:10:06,210
What?

784
01:10:06,410 --> 01:10:08,070
We're gonna have to lie.

785
01:10:09,650 --> 01:10:10,980
Lie about what?

786
01:10:11,180 --> 01:10:13,093
Everything, all of it.

787
01:10:13,343 --> 01:10:16,200
Every moment since we
crashed on the island.

788
01:10:18,910 --> 01:10:21,215
Jack. Now I know I'm new to this
group and everything,

789
01:10:21,415 --> 01:10:22,719
but isn't this the
place where everybody...

790
01:10:22,919 --> 01:10:24,445
starts jumping up and down
and hugging each other?

791
01:10:24,545 --> 01:10:25,790
Your freighter.

792
01:10:25,990 --> 01:10:29,010
Those men came to the island
to kill us, all of us.

793
01:10:31,030 --> 01:10:33,065
You said that our plane was discovered
on the bottom of the ocean.

794
01:10:33,165 --> 01:10:35,362
Well, someone put it there,
someone who wants everyone

795
01:10:35,462 --> 01:10:37,060
to think that we're dead.

796
01:10:38,680 --> 01:10:40,332
So what do you think's
gonna happen to us

797
01:10:40,432 --> 01:10:42,530
when we tell them that
that wasn't our plane?

798
01:10:45,620 --> 01:10:48,250
What do you think's gonna happen to the
people that we left behind?

799
01:10:52,920 --> 01:10:54,780
Jack, we can't.

800
01:10:56,060 --> 01:10:57,540
We can't pull it off.

801
01:11:01,040 --> 01:11:02,790
Just let me do the talking.

802
01:11:47,540 --> 01:11:48,940
...Ms. Widmore.

803
01:11:51,862 --> 01:11:53,462
Ms. Widmore!

804
01:11:57,690 --> 01:12:00,220
Throw them a rope!
Take them 'round to the stern!

805
01:12:02,860 --> 01:12:04,370
Penny?

806
01:12:08,560 --> 01:12:11,140
<i>Penny! Penny!</i>

807
01:13:07,430 --> 01:13:08,894
Are you okay?

808
01:13:09,644 --> 01:13:11,520
I'm... I'm fine.

809
01:13:15,880 --> 01:13:17,615
How did you find me?

810
01:13:18,215 --> 01:13:19,870
Your phone call.

811
01:13:21,260 --> 01:13:23,330
I have a tracking station.

812
01:13:28,200 --> 01:13:29,860
I love you, Penny.

813
01:13:31,720 --> 01:13:34,020
And I'll never leave you again.

814
01:13:49,220 --> 01:13:50,675
This is... this is Penny.

815
01:13:50,875 --> 01:13:53,930
This is, um, Kate and then Aaron.

816
01:13:57,380 --> 01:14:01,438
And this is Sun, Sayid, Hurley.

817
01:14:01,588 --> 01:14:02,410
Hi.

818
01:14:02,810 --> 01:14:04,490
This is Frank.

819
01:14:06,240 --> 01:14:08,989
And Jack.
Jack, this is... this is Penny.

820
01:14:09,190 --> 01:14:11,093
It's nice to meet you, Penny.

821
01:14:11,143 --> 01:14:11,890
Hi.

822
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:15,680
But we need to talk.

823
01:14:28,830 --> 01:14:30,530
What's this place called?

824
01:14:31,620 --> 01:14:33,285
Membata.

825
01:14:33,485 --> 01:14:35,030
Membata.

826
01:14:39,750 --> 01:14:41,465
Why are we doing this, dude?

827
01:14:41,865 --> 01:14:44,250
<i>Sailing 3000 miles
to another island?</i>

828
01:14:45,500 --> 01:14:48,220
Because it's the only
way to keep them safe.

829
01:14:58,170 --> 01:14:59,390
How long till we'll hit land?

830
01:14:59,590 --> 01:15:01,315
Oh, if the wind's not too brutal,

831
01:15:02,315 --> 01:15:04,160
Eight, nine hours.

832
01:15:04,760 --> 01:15:07,700
Just long enough to give you
a nice, convincing sunburn.

833
01:15:07,780 --> 01:15:08,291
Well...

834
01:15:09,641 --> 01:15:11,260
It's been a pleasure, Frank.

835
01:15:11,560 --> 01:15:13,175
I hope we never see each other again.

836
01:15:13,375 --> 01:15:15,090
Roger that, Doc.

837
01:15:19,620 --> 01:15:21,220
Bye, sweetheart.

838
01:15:33,210 --> 01:15:35,180
Are you sure about this, brother?

839
01:15:37,010 --> 01:15:38,560
Are you sure?

840
01:15:40,600 --> 01:15:42,410
As long as I've got Penny,

841
01:15:44,690 --> 01:15:46,240
I'll be fine.

842
01:15:47,850 --> 01:15:49,840
Don't let him find you, Desmond.

843
01:15:57,690 --> 01:16:00,190
Then I'll see you in
another life, brother.

844
01:16:02,730 --> 01:16:03,714
Aye.

845
01:16:06,364 --> 01:16:08,130
I guess you will.

846
01:16:11,430 --> 01:16:12,920
All right.

847
01:16:13,990 --> 01:16:15,640
Let's go home.

848
01:18:09,300 --> 01:18:13,345
# Sleeping on your belly,
you break my arms, #

849
01:18:13,545 --> 01:18:15,165
<i># you spoon my eyes, #</i>

850
01:18:15,414 --> 01:18:17,335
<i># been rubbing a bad charm #</i>

851
01:18:17,535 --> 01:18:20,705
<i># with holy fingers gouge away, #</i>

852
01:18:22,554 --> 01:18:23,780
# you can-- #

853
01:19:59,780 --> 01:20:01,290
<i>Hello, Jack.</i>

854
01:20:04,130 --> 01:20:05,570
<i>Sorry.</i>

855
01:20:05,670 --> 01:20:07,210
<i>Didn't mean to scare you.</i>

856
01:20:09,860 --> 01:20:12,330
Did he tell you that
I was off the island?

857
01:20:16,170 --> 01:20:17,590
Yes, he did.

858
01:20:23,970 --> 01:20:25,740
When did you speak to him?

859
01:20:28,450 --> 01:20:30,050
About a month ago.

860
01:20:30,450 --> 01:20:31,932
And Kate?

861
01:20:33,182 --> 01:20:34,580
Yeah.

862
01:20:35,980 --> 01:20:38,110
Yeah, he came to see her, too.

863
01:20:38,611 --> 01:20:40,670
And what did he say to you?

864
01:20:42,030 --> 01:20:46,220
He told me that after I left the island,

865
01:20:48,569 --> 01:20:50,830
some very bad things happened.

866
01:20:54,250 --> 01:20:58,520
And he told me that
it was my fault for leaving.

867
01:21:01,670 --> 01:21:04,320
And he said that I had to come back.

868
01:21:05,850 --> 01:21:08,760
Yes, I heard that you've been flying
on passenger planes,

869
01:21:10,560 --> 01:21:12,490
hoping that you'd crash.

870
01:21:14,730 --> 01:21:17,535
It's dark, Jack, very dark.

871
01:21:18,635 --> 01:21:20,540
Why are you here?

872
01:21:22,100 --> 01:21:25,500
I'm here to tell you that the island
won't let you come alone.

873
01:21:33,540 --> 01:21:35,590
All of you have to go back.

874
01:21:36,490 --> 01:21:38,220
Are you--?

875
01:21:41,220 --> 01:21:43,980
Sayid... I don't even
know where Sayid is.

876
01:21:44,480 --> 01:21:47,780
Hurley is insane.

877
01:21:48,580 --> 01:21:50,610
Sun blames me for--

878
01:21:52,910 --> 01:21:54,870
And then Kate...

879
01:21:57,550 --> 01:21:59,490
She won't even talk
to me anymore.

880
01:22:00,490 --> 01:22:02,500
Perhaps I can help you with that.

881
01:22:05,870 --> 01:22:07,700
This is the way it has to be, Jack.

882
01:22:08,300 --> 01:22:10,060
It's the only way.

883
01:22:11,830 --> 01:22:14,310
You have to do it together, all of you.

884
01:22:15,750 --> 01:22:17,050
How?

885
01:22:18,490 --> 01:22:20,460
I have a few ideas.

886
01:22:35,490 --> 01:22:36,567
Jack.

887
01:22:37,717 --> 01:22:39,040
I said, all of you.

888
01:22:41,010 --> 01:22:42,820
We're gonna have to bring him, too.
