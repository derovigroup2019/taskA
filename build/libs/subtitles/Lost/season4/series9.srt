00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:02,400
Previously on "Lost"

2
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:06,990
Miles here and three of his people came
to the island about a week ago.

3
00:00:07,090 --> 00:00:10,180
Share with us exactly why they're here.

4
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:11,590
We're here for him.

5
00:00:11,690 --> 00:00:13,405
Problem solved.
How soon do we turn him over?

6
00:00:13,505 --> 00:00:14,730
We can't turn him over.

7
00:00:14,830 --> 00:00:18,540
Once they have me, their orders are
to kill everyone else on the island.

8
00:00:18,850 --> 00:00:21,180
He won't even tell us who his spy on the boat is.

9
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:22,270
It's Michael.

10
00:00:22,370 --> 00:00:23,680
Pull!

11
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:26,550
What are you guys doing?

12
00:00:26,650 --> 00:00:27,740
We're shooting things.

13
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:29,190
This is a map to the temple.

14
00:00:29,290 --> 00:00:30,410
It's a sanctuary.

15
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:32,205
It may be the last safe place on this island.

16
00:00:32,305 --> 00:00:34,300
If you leave now, you can get there
in a day and a half.

17
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:35,960
Your mother will protect you.

18
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:43,830
Karl?

19
00:00:43,930 --> 00:00:45,240
No!

20
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:46,360
Come on. Come on. He's gone.

21
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:48,610
No!

22
00:00:52,180 --> 00:00:53,370
No! Wait! Wait! Don't!

23
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:55,120
I'm Ben's daughter!

24
00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:56,840
I'm his daughter!

25
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:38,220
You got a prescription for that?

26
00:01:39,250 --> 00:01:40,700
Yeah.

27
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:43,020
I wrote it myself.

28
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:49,640
You look terrible.

29
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:51,530
Well, thanks.

30
00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:54,060
What are those?

31
00:01:55,730 --> 00:01:58,430
Antibiotics. I just got a...

32
00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:00,180
A stomach bug.

33
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:02,800
You should eat some crackers.

34
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:06,310
Crackers always make me feel better.

35
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:14,050
Why aren't they back
from the boat yet, Jack?

36
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:17,900
Well, Sayid said the engine was down.

37
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:20,210
My guess is they're trying to fix it

38
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:22,720
and wondering why the hell
they can't get in touch with us.

39
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:24,400
And you're not worried?

40
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:25,615
No.

41
00:02:25,715 --> 00:02:27,880
My gut says we're getting off this island.

42
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:29,720
I thought your gut was sick.

43
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:34,620
Help! I need some help!

44
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,700
Help!

45
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:37,840
Help!

46
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:39,950
I need help!
I need some help down here!

47
00:02:47,730 --> 00:02:48,820
The dog was barking.

48
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:50,370
I didn't see him.

49
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:19,030
Do you know who this is?

50
00:03:20,770 --> 00:03:22,600
He was on our boat.

51
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:26,990
He's the doctor.

52
00:03:31,570 --> 00:03:33,230
We're all gonna die.

53
00:03:33,850 --> 00:03:35,670
Calm down, chicken little.

54
00:03:35,770 --> 00:03:37,820
The sky ain't falling just yet.

55
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:40,510
This is exactly what he wants--
to fight amongst ourselves.

56
00:03:40,610 --> 00:03:41,830
You're making a big mistake, dude.

57
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:43,790
It's his to make, Hugo.

58
00:03:46,090 --> 00:03:47,610
Let's get on with it.

59
00:03:50,850 --> 00:03:52,170
Right.

60
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:57,030
I'm attackin' Siberia.

61
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,140
Sorry.

62
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:05,250
Can't believe you're just
giving him Australia.

63
00:04:05,350 --> 00:04:06,920
Australia's the key to the whole game.

64
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:08,540
Says you.

65
00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:17,280
Stop here.

66
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:18,610
On your knees.

67
00:04:18,970 --> 00:04:20,520
Get on your knees.

68
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:31,150
Turn this thing off.

69
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:36,690
P-please.

70
00:04:37,150 --> 00:04:39,650
There's a baby with them.
Just promise you won't...

71
00:04:40,570 --> 00:04:42,670
Turn the fence off.

72
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:53,700
Okay.

73
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:55,120
It's off.

74
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:12,620
Code 14-J.

75
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:16,340
Code 14-J.

76
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:18,420
Who is it?

77
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:20,410
I think it's for Ben.

78
00:05:38,290 --> 00:05:40,460
What's "code 14-J"?

79
00:05:41,970 --> 00:05:43,370
Where did you hear that?

80
00:05:43,470 --> 00:05:44,880
The phone rang. I picked it up.

81
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:47,340
A voice kept repeating, "code 14-J".

82
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:50,660
We need to get to the other house.

83
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:53,135
It's easier to fortify, and we'll have
better position on the tree lines.

84
00:05:53,235 --> 00:05:54,650
What are you talking about?

85
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:56,410
They're here.

90
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:13,640
No, no, no, no. Wait.

91
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:20,920
Wait. I can explain.

92
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:22,410
D-do you speak English?

93
00:07:34,610 --> 00:07:36,140
Sure. Sure.

94
00:07:48,030 --> 00:07:53,380
Okay.

95
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:55,170
This...

96
00:08:01,910 --> 00:08:03,465
Surrender!

97
00:08:03,565 --> 00:08:05,550
Oh, so you do speak English.

98
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:33,070
Let me guess.

99
00:08:33,170 --> 00:08:35,190
"14-J" ain't the code for the pizza boy.

100
00:08:35,570 --> 00:08:37,370
It's an early warning system.

101
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:38,745
Warning for what?

102
00:08:38,845 --> 00:08:41,120
Somebody tripped the panic switch
at our security fence.

103
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:43,660
That means one of my
people's been captured.

104
00:08:43,950 --> 00:08:47,970
How long did you guys debate amongst yourselves
whether or not to ask me why the phone rang?

105
00:08:48,670 --> 00:08:49,850
Five minutes.

106
00:08:49,950 --> 00:08:52,240
Well, so much for our head start.

107
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:53,460
Hold up.

108
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:55,110
If we're hunkerin' down,
I gotta grab frenchie and the kids.

109
00:08:55,210 --> 00:08:56,610
Don't bother. They're safe.

110
00:08:56,710 --> 00:08:58,950
I sent Rousseau, Alex
and Karl away yesterday.

111
00:08:59,050 --> 00:09:00,690
Away where?

112
00:09:01,730 --> 00:09:04,300
Whatever. Claire's still sleepin'. I'll grab her.

113
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:05,780
There's no time.

114
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:07,150
I'll make time.

115
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:12,190
It's very important that you survive
what's about to happen here, John.

116
00:09:12,290 --> 00:09:14,270
So I need you to stay close to me.

117
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:15,620
And why would I do that?

118
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:17,990
Because the people that are coming
won't risk hurting me.

119
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:19,300
You want to live?

120
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:21,010
I'm your best chance.

121
00:09:26,370 --> 00:09:28,230
His throat was slit.

122
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:33,030
Know anything about that?

123
00:09:34,550 --> 00:09:36,090
No.

124
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:37,800
Uh, he was fine when I last saw him.

125
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:39,290
Which was when?

126
00:09:39,390 --> 00:09:41,120
When?

127
00:09:41,950 --> 00:09:43,910
"When" is kind of a relative term.

128
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:49,400
We don't know anything about this.

129
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:51,430
Any luck fixing the sat-phone?

130
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:53,730
Uh, yeah. Sorry, no.

131
00:09:53,830 --> 00:09:55,615
The, uh, mike was...

132
00:09:55,715 --> 00:09:56,760
smashed up pretty good.

133
00:09:56,860 --> 00:10:01,500
Best-case scenario, we'd only be able to
broadcast tone squelch. Beeps and boops.

134
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:04,900
Well, yeah, but you could still use it
as sort of a telegraph, right?

135
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,320
If I had some strips of ferrous metal, uh,

136
00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:10,960
a 9-volt battery clip and some...

137
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:12,260
wiring.

138
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:14,270
We got a bunch of stuff that we
salvaged from the plane.

139
00:10:14,590 --> 00:10:16,110
Great.

140
00:10:16,230 --> 00:10:17,890
I'll show you where it is.

141
00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:25,910
Bernard, you got a second?

142
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:33,900
These people who are coming--
you're scared of 'em, aren't you?

143
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,030
That's right, John. I am.

144
00:10:37,310 --> 00:10:38,800
What's going on?

145
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:43,800
Get away from the window, Hugo.

146
00:10:48,030 --> 00:10:49,805
How's Sawyer gonna get back in?

147
00:10:49,905 --> 00:10:51,470
He's not.

148
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:57,760
You see if Claire left
her house this morning?

149
00:10:57,880 --> 00:10:59,800
What's going on?
Why do you have that?

150
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:01,740
Just get back inside and wait until--

151
00:11:07,110 --> 00:11:08,740
Get back inside!

152
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:11,930
Get inside!

153
00:11:23,810 --> 00:11:25,720
Claire!

154
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:37,050
Claire!

155
00:11:48,390 --> 00:11:49,940
Claire!

156
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:10,470
Good afternoon, sir.

157
00:12:10,570 --> 00:12:11,980
Good afternoon. I'd like a room, please.

158
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:13,850
Of course, sir.

159
00:12:13,950 --> 00:12:16,680
Is this your first time in Tunisia?

160
00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:20,940
No, but it's been a while.

161
00:12:22,030 --> 00:12:23,420
Your name?

162
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:25,670
I'm actually a preferred guest.

163
00:12:25,770 --> 00:12:28,350
It should be under "Dean Moriarty".

164
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:38,780
Certainly, Mr. Moriarty.

165
00:12:42,370 --> 00:12:44,430
May I help you with anything else?

166
00:12:44,530 --> 00:12:45,770
Yes.

167
00:12:45,870 --> 00:12:47,150
Um, today's date is...

168
00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:49,030
October 24th, sir.

169
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:51,150
2005?

170
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:52,670
Yes, sir.

171
00:12:52,770 --> 00:12:54,440
2005.

172
00:12:56,820 --> 00:12:58,220
Thank you.

173
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:13,460
I just want to bury my wife in peace.

174
00:13:28,830 --> 00:13:31,070
Right now I need you to tell me
what's going on.

175
00:13:31,170 --> 00:13:33,550
I think the technical term is
"shock and awe".

176
00:13:33,790 --> 00:13:35,600
They're trying to frighten me
into surrendering.

177
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:37,290
Well, why did they stop shooting?

178
00:13:37,390 --> 00:13:38,820
Was that Claire's house?

179
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:41,275
Claire was there.

180
00:13:41,375 --> 00:13:43,340
Hugo, get the baby away from the window.

181
00:13:43,870 --> 00:13:45,360
Put him in the back room.

182
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:51,720
You said I need to survive this. Why?

183
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:54,430
Because there's only one person that can
help us now, and that's Jacob,

184
00:13:54,530 --> 00:13:56,340
and we have to go to him together.

185
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:58,270
What makes you think I can find him?

186
00:13:58,370 --> 00:14:00,160
I-I don't even know where the cabin is.

187
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:03,380
I know, but Hurley does.

188
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:06,310
Claire!

189
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:08,160
Claire!

190
00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:09,820
Claire!

191
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:15,400
Claire!

192
00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:20,610
Are you okay?

193
00:14:22,010 --> 00:14:23,110
Charlie?

194
00:14:23,210 --> 00:14:24,590
Okay.

195
00:14:24,690 --> 00:14:26,000
Where's Aaron?

196
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:28,100
He's with us. It's okay.
We're gonna move now.

197
00:14:28,530 --> 00:14:29,990
Let's go.

198
00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:39,720
Open the front door!

199
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:49,100
Hugo, you don't want to do that.

200
00:14:52,950 --> 00:14:54,430
Open the damn door!

201
00:14:55,950 --> 00:14:57,385
Open the door!

202
00:14:57,485 --> 00:14:59,190
Open the damn door!

203
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,340
Careful.

204
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:11,840
Is she all right?

205
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:13,780
She got her bell rung,
but she's gonna be all right.

206
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:20,440
They just started ooting.

207
00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:22,040
Why?

208
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:26,310
Why slaughter people without even
telling us what they want?

209
00:15:26,410 --> 00:15:28,900
Those people were murdered
to make you angry, James.

210
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,525
So you'd be more likely to come storming
in here and throw me to the wolves.

211
00:15:32,625 --> 00:15:34,290
Yeah, what's wrong with that?

212
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,150
Sounds like a great plan to me.

213
00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:37,990
What do you say, on three?

214
00:15:45,350 --> 00:15:48,090
- I wouldn't if I were you.
- Shut up!

215
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:06,950
Miles?

216
00:16:09,210 --> 00:16:10,770
Who the hell let you out?

217
00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:12,390
The people who gave me this.

218
00:16:16,020 --> 00:16:17,580
They want to talk.

219
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:02,075
You vultures, you followed me to Tikrit?

220
00:18:02,175 --> 00:18:03,930
You spy on me?

221
00:18:09,490 --> 00:18:11,260
What are you doing here?

222
00:18:12,290 --> 00:18:14,720
I'm here to find the man
who murdered your wife.

223
00:18:23,830 --> 00:18:25,480
How did you get here?

224
00:18:26,130 --> 00:18:27,720
I came across the Syrian border.

225
00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:30,610
- It's really not as difficult as you might--
- How did you get off the island?

226
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:32,715
Your friend Desmond had a boat.

227
00:18:32,815 --> 00:18:35,260
Remember? The Elizabeth.

228
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:37,390
I followed a heading to Fiji.

229
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:39,760
Then I chartered a plane.

230
00:18:41,180 --> 00:18:42,860
Why now?

231
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:47,090
You remember the name
Charles Widmore, don't you?

232
00:18:48,740 --> 00:18:51,065
The man who tried to convince
the world that your plane was

233
00:18:51,165 --> 00:18:52,220
on the bottom of the ocean?

234
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:54,170
What does it have to do with me?

235
00:18:54,270 --> 00:18:55,550
With Nadia?

236
00:18:55,650 --> 00:18:57,670
There was a man at her procession.

237
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:01,710
He goes by the name of Ishmael Bakir.

238
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:04,410
He's one of Widmore's men.

239
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:11,920
Bakir was last seen five days
ago in Los Angeles,

240
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:13,600
caught by a traffic camera,

241
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:17,410
speeding away from the corner
of La Breya and Santa Monica.

242
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:25,470
That's three blocks from
where Nadia was killed.

243
00:19:33,820 --> 00:19:36,260
Why would these people want to murder her?

244
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:37,940
I don't know.

245
00:19:39,210 --> 00:19:40,960
But they did.

246
00:19:54,190 --> 00:19:55,780
How many of 'em are there?

247
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:57,680
Maybe six.

248
00:19:57,780 --> 00:19:58,910
I'm not sure.

249
00:19:59,010 --> 00:20:00,610
The hell you mean, you ain't sure?

250
00:20:00,710 --> 00:20:02,200
You came over on the same boat
with 'em, didn't ya?

251
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:03,960
They told me they were just security.

252
00:20:04,060 --> 00:20:05,540
Security for what?

253
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:06,650
For him.

254
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:09,280
Once they got him, to escort him
back to the mainland.

255
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:13,220
Well, Miles, sounds like you're not
gonna collect your $3.2 million.

256
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:16,790
Just take it.

257
00:20:16,890 --> 00:20:18,520
Why would I talk to them?

258
00:20:18,970 --> 00:20:21,010
Because they have a hostage.

259
00:20:21,110 --> 00:20:23,160
Well, then they've badly miscalculated,

260
00:20:23,260 --> 00:20:26,270
'cause every single one of my people is
prepared to die in service to this island.

261
00:20:26,370 --> 00:20:28,370
It's your daughter!

262
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:45,410
Hello?

263
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,290
Am I speaking to Benjamin Linus?

264
00:20:50,980 --> 00:20:52,770
That's right.

265
00:20:53,170 --> 00:20:55,035
My name is Martin Keamy.

266
00:20:55,135 --> 00:20:57,200
I'm an employee of Charles Widmore.

267
00:20:57,300 --> 00:20:58,620
Who's Charles Widmore?

268
00:20:58,720 --> 00:20:59,575
Later.

269
00:20:59,675 --> 00:21:01,660
I'd like you to go look out your east window

270
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:03,960
so we can talk about this face-to-face.

271
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:12,430
To the left.

272
00:21:13,950 --> 00:21:15,430
You see me?

273
00:21:16,370 --> 00:21:17,870
Yeah, I see you.

274
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:21,620
All right, Mr. Linus, these are my terms:

275
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:22,930
You're gonna step out the front door,

276
00:21:23,030 --> 00:21:26,100
put your hands above your head,
and you're gonna walk straight to me.

277
00:21:26,310 --> 00:21:28,060
Once I have you in my custody,

278
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:31,160
then I promise you that no one else
in that house will be harmed.

279
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:37,410
You and I both know
that once you have me,

280
00:21:37,510 --> 00:21:40,790
there's nothing to stop you from killing
everybody else on this island.

281
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:43,520
What kind of guy do you think I am?

282
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:48,075
Martin Christopher Keamy-- former first sergeant,
United States Marine Corps,

283
00:21:48,175 --> 00:21:52,690
served with distinction from 1996 to 2001,
but since then,

284
00:21:52,790 --> 00:21:57,710
you've worked with a number of mercenary
organizations, specifically in Uganda.

285
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:02,560
So I know exactly what kind of
man you are, Mr. Keamy,

286
00:22:02,660 --> 00:22:05,090
and we can dispense with the formalities.

287
00:22:06,690 --> 00:22:08,150
Okay, Ben.

288
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:10,350
You got it.

289
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:22,630
Get down.

290
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:34,850
Get your ass out here right now...

291
00:22:37,010 --> 00:22:38,980
or I'm gonna kill your daughter.

292
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:53,880
I'd like to present a counterproposal.

293
00:22:56,850 --> 00:22:58,330
I'm listening.

294
00:22:59,670 --> 00:23:01,640
You and your friends...

295
00:23:02,210 --> 00:23:03,835
You turn around.

296
00:23:03,935 --> 00:23:06,090
Walk back to your helicopter.

297
00:23:06,190 --> 00:23:09,360
You fly away and forget you
ever heard of this island.

298
00:23:18,590 --> 00:23:20,220
Tell your daddy good-bye.

299
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:24,080
Dad...

300
00:23:24,180 --> 00:23:25,750
They're serious.

301
00:23:25,850 --> 00:23:30,150
They killed Karl and my mother.

302
00:23:30,250 --> 00:23:31,440
Alex...

303
00:23:31,540 --> 00:23:33,250
I have this under control.

304
00:23:33,710 --> 00:23:35,510
Everything's gonna be okay.

305
00:23:35,610 --> 00:23:37,620
Please, daddy!

306
00:23:38,780 --> 00:23:40,880
Please.

307
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:44,930
You have ten seconds, Ben.

308
00:23:45,190 --> 00:23:46,435
Okay, listen.

309
00:23:46,535 --> 00:23:48,020
Nine...

310
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:50,400
She's not my daughter.

311
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:51,630
Eight...

312
00:23:51,730 --> 00:23:54,210
I stole her as a baby from
an insane woman.

313
00:23:55,340 --> 00:23:57,550
She's a pawn, nothing more.

314
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:01,570
She means nothing to me.

315
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:09,000
I'm not coming out of this house.

316
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:12,170
So if you want to kill her,
go ahead and do it--

317
00:24:39,620 --> 00:24:40,920
I don't see 'em.

318
00:24:41,020 --> 00:24:43,420
They just left her body there
and disappeared into the jungle.

319
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:45,140
They won't be gone for long.

320
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:48,630
It's gonna be dark in about 20 minutes,
and then they're gonna come for him.

321
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:53,730
Then let's just hand him over.

322
00:24:55,220 --> 00:24:59,160
I don't think these people have any
intentions of letting us walk of here alive,

323
00:24:59,260 --> 00:25:00,950
James, no matter what we do.

324
00:25:01,050 --> 00:25:03,070
Well, I ain't got no intention of dyin'.

325
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:06,590
He changed the rules.

326
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:09,360
What? Who?

327
00:25:10,510 --> 00:25:12,060
What rules?

328
00:25:19,110 --> 00:25:20,620
You know I'm right.

329
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:23,730
Our best chance here is to toss
him out and fend for ourselves.

330
00:25:27,620 --> 00:25:29,170
Where you goin'?

331
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:33,350
Open this damn door!

332
00:25:34,450 --> 00:25:36,100
Open up!

333
00:26:58,140 --> 00:26:59,500
Walk.

334
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:08,110
Who are you and why are you following me?

335
00:27:08,670 --> 00:27:10,680
My name is Benjamin Linus,

336
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:17,000
and I need you to take a message
to Mr. Widmore for me.

337
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:19,130
And what message is that?

338
00:27:34,940 --> 00:27:36,420
That should do it.

339
00:27:39,820 --> 00:27:41,230
Wait.

340
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:44,220
Where do you think you're going?

341
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:46,430
We're finished here, Sayid.

342
00:27:47,170 --> 00:27:48,850
Turn around and walk away.

343
00:27:50,310 --> 00:27:52,420
Mourn your loss. Get on with your life.

344
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:54,330
I have no life.

345
00:27:54,430 --> 00:27:55,900
They took it from me.

346
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,730
Go home, Sayid.

347
00:27:58,100 --> 00:28:01,490
Once you let your grief become anger,
it will never go away.

348
00:28:03,210 --> 00:28:05,230
I speak from experience.

349
00:28:06,980 --> 00:28:08,020
This is my war.

350
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:09,830
It's not yours.

351
00:28:12,650 --> 00:28:17,960
I spent the last eight years of my life
searching for the woman I love.

352
00:28:19,790 --> 00:28:22,160
I finally found her and I married her.

353
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:26,680
And I buried her yesterday.

354
00:28:26,780 --> 00:28:29,700
So don't tell me this is not my war.

355
00:28:36,530 --> 00:28:38,090
Benjamin...

356
00:28:39,860 --> 00:28:41,470
Who's next?

357
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:46,140
I'll be in touch.

358
00:28:55,710 --> 00:28:57,300
Open the damn door!

359
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:59,110
Son of a bitch just left us here.

360
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:00,980
Open the damn door!

361
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:02,430
What's going on?

362
00:29:02,530 --> 00:29:03,820
Claire?

363
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:06,990
You all right, sweetheart?

364
00:29:07,090 --> 00:29:09,900
Yeah, a bit wobbly, but, uh, I'll live.

365
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,520
Well, I wouldn't be too sure about that.

366
00:29:15,740 --> 00:29:17,210
Excuse me, James.

367
00:29:17,570 --> 00:29:18,980
Excuse you?

368
00:29:21,670 --> 00:29:23,100
What were you doing in there?

369
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:24,920
Okay, listen to me very carefully:

370
00:29:25,020 --> 00:29:26,990
I need all of you to do exactly as I say.

371
00:29:27,090 --> 00:29:29,880
In a minute, we have to run from
this house as fast as we can.

372
00:29:29,980 --> 00:29:32,045
At that moment, when I give the order,

373
00:29:32,145 --> 00:29:34,570
I want you to head straight for the tree line.

374
00:29:35,710 --> 00:29:38,260
You mean towards the guys with guns?

375
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:41,890
No, we want to be as far away
from them as possible.

376
00:30:07,670 --> 00:30:08,855
Okay, outside.

377
00:30:08,955 --> 00:30:10,360
Outside now!

378
00:30:28,670 --> 00:30:30,140
What did you do?

379
00:30:34,610 --> 00:30:36,740
Did you just call that thing?

380
00:30:50,980 --> 00:30:52,230
Fall back!

381
00:30:52,330 --> 00:30:54,380
Go!

382
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:57,060
Head for the trees.
I'll catch up with you.

383
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:59,550
Hey, where are you going?

384
00:30:59,650 --> 00:31:02,260
I have to say good-bye
to my daughter, John.

385
00:32:08,290 --> 00:32:10,060
I can't believe it.

386
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:12,510
Might actually have a signal.

387
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:15,130
What are you sending?

388
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:18,850
"What...

389
00:32:18,950 --> 00:32:20,730
happened...

390
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:22,340
to...

391
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:24,230
the...

392
00:32:24,460 --> 00:32:26,180
doctor?"

393
00:32:52,870 --> 00:32:53,910
Okay.

394
00:32:54,010 --> 00:32:56,745
They didn't exactly say what
happened to the doctor,

395
00:32:56,845 --> 00:33:01,700
but your friends are fine, and the helicopter's
coming back in--in the morning.

396
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:05,650
- Well... 
- He's lying.

397
00:33:06,020 --> 00:33:09,215
What the message said was,
"What are you talking about?"

398
00:33:09,315 --> 00:33:11,550
"The doctor is fine."

399
00:33:19,690 --> 00:33:21,500
You know morse code.

400
00:33:24,650 --> 00:33:28,700
What does that mean,
"The doctor is fine"?

401
00:33:29,270 --> 00:33:30,970
I don't know.

402
00:33:31,530 --> 00:33:33,250
Why are you lying?

403
00:33:34,180 --> 00:33:38,440
Why did you say that the
helicopters are coming back?

404
00:33:40,630 --> 00:33:42,280
Jack.

405
00:33:42,380 --> 00:33:43,940
Were you ever...

406
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:45,840
gonna take us off this island?

407
00:33:52,150 --> 00:33:53,860
No.

408
00:33:54,970 --> 00:33:56,900
No.

409
00:34:05,980 --> 00:34:07,700
Jack.

410
00:34:27,590 --> 00:34:30,190
I think your chopper buddies ran
that way, if you wanna catch up.

411
00:34:31,640 --> 00:34:34,500
Yeah, I think I'll stay with
you guys for--for now.

412
00:34:54,610 --> 00:34:56,520
Sorry about your daughter.

413
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:00,260
Thank you, John.

414
00:35:01,350 --> 00:35:03,410
That being said, you lied to me.

415
00:35:04,230 --> 00:35:06,740
You told me you didn't know
what the smoke monster was.

416
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:10,640
You can ask Jacob all about it
when we go to the cabin.

417
00:35:11,750 --> 00:35:12,940
Hang on.

418
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:14,640
"Jacob"?

419
00:35:16,470 --> 00:35:18,150
Who the hell's Jacob?

420
00:35:18,740 --> 00:35:21,490
He's the man that's gonna tell us
what to do next, James.

421
00:35:23,070 --> 00:35:24,580
You know what?

422
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:26,330
I'm done with all this.

423
00:35:26,430 --> 00:35:28,900
I never should have followed
you wackos in the first place.

424
00:35:29,550 --> 00:35:32,320
I'm goin' back to the beach,
and Claire and the kid are comin' with me.

425
00:35:33,690 --> 00:35:35,595
You good with that?

426
00:35:35,695 --> 00:35:37,480
Yeah, I'm good with that.

427
00:35:37,950 --> 00:35:39,450
I'm coming with you.

428
00:35:41,030 --> 00:35:42,320
Let's go.

429
00:35:42,950 --> 00:35:44,500
You, too, Hurley.

430
00:35:53,830 --> 00:35:55,470
Have you lost your mind?

431
00:35:55,650 --> 00:35:57,350
Hugo stays with us.

432
00:36:01,940 --> 00:36:03,000
Not a chance.

433
00:36:03,100 --> 00:36:04,150
Wait. Leave me out of this.

434
00:36:04,250 --> 00:36:05,310
I'm sorry, Hugo.

435
00:36:05,410 --> 00:36:06,600
We need you to find the cabin.

436
00:36:06,700 --> 00:36:09,255
He ain't goin' anywhere with you,
you crazy son of a bitch.

437
00:36:09,355 --> 00:36:12,080
Stop! Put the guns down.
I'll go with Locke.

438
00:36:12,430 --> 00:36:14,800
- Hugo.
- It's okay, Sawyer.

439
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:19,800
Please, put your gun down.

440
00:36:22,780 --> 00:36:24,280
You, too.

441
00:36:24,380 --> 00:36:26,370
You don't have to do this.

442
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:30,600
You guys go back to the beach.
I'll catch up sooner or later.

443
00:36:40,300 --> 00:36:43,210
You harm so much as one hair
on his curly head...

444
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:45,880
I'll kill you.

445
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:48,400
Fair enough.

446
00:36:55,720 --> 00:36:57,110
Let's go.

447
00:36:58,820 --> 00:37:00,730
Go. Move.

448
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:12,610
Which way?

449
00:37:18,370 --> 00:37:19,780
Follow me.

450
00:37:31,750 --> 00:37:34,000
Thank you.

451
00:37:41,570 --> 00:37:43,270
Good evening, sir.
May I help you?

452
00:37:43,370 --> 00:37:47,000
Oh, yes. I'm here to see
Mr. and Mrs. Kendrick in 4E.

453
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:48,990
At this hour, sir?

454
00:37:49,210 --> 00:37:50,900
They're expecting me.

455
00:37:52,060 --> 00:37:53,830
Feel free to call up.

456
00:37:56,190 --> 00:37:57,720
No need, sir.

457
00:37:57,820 --> 00:37:59,200
Good night, sir.

458
00:38:54,010 --> 00:38:55,800
Wake up, Charles.

459
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:09,840
I wondered when you were gonna show up.

460
00:39:12,980 --> 00:39:15,035
I see you've been getting more sun.

461
00:39:15,135 --> 00:39:17,430
Iraq is lovely this time of year.

462
00:39:20,250 --> 00:39:22,970
When did you start sleeping
with a bottle of scotch by the bed?

463
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:25,710
When the nightmares started.

464
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:39,780
Have you come here to kill me, Benjamin?

465
00:39:40,810 --> 00:39:43,210
We both know I can't do that.

466
00:39:45,330 --> 00:39:47,080
Then why are you here?

467
00:39:51,730 --> 00:39:54,630
I'm here, Charles, because
you murdered my daughter.

468
00:39:56,560 --> 00:40:00,400
Don't stand there, looking at me
with those horrible eyes of yours

469
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:03,710
and lay the blame for the death
of that poor girl on me,

470
00:40:04,830 --> 00:40:09,500
when we both know very well
I didn't murder her at all, Benjamin.

471
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,700
You did.

472
00:40:13,670 --> 00:40:15,590
No, that's not true.

473
00:40:16,020 --> 00:40:18,610
Yes, Benjamin, it is.

474
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:24,040
You creep into my bedroom
in the dead of night like a rat

475
00:40:24,770 --> 00:40:27,960
and have the audacity to pretend
that you're the victim?

476
00:40:30,450 --> 00:40:32,440
I know who you are, boy.

477
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:35,110
What you are.

478
00:40:35,550 --> 00:40:38,460
I know that everything you have
you took from me.

479
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:43,980
So...

480
00:40:44,080 --> 00:40:46,570
Once again I ask you:

481
00:40:46,670 --> 00:40:48,620
Why are you here?

482
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:54,320
I'm here, Charles, to tell you
that I'm going to kill your daughter.

483
00:40:58,120 --> 00:41:00,090
Penelope, is it?

484
00:41:01,730 --> 00:41:03,800
And once she's gone...

485
00:41:05,580 --> 00:41:07,370
Once she's dead...

486
00:41:09,420 --> 00:41:11,770
then you'll understand how I feel.

487
00:41:14,910 --> 00:41:17,240
And you'll wish you hadn't changed the rules.

488
00:41:24,590 --> 00:41:26,230
You'll never find her.

489
00:41:30,230 --> 00:41:32,080
That island's mine, Benjamin.

490
00:41:32,620 --> 00:41:34,500
It always was.

491
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:36,310
It will be again.

492
00:41:38,230 --> 00:41:40,240
But you'll never find it.

493
00:41:41,420 --> 00:41:44,270
Then I suppose the hunt is on for both of us.

494
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:46,770
I suppose it is.

495
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:51,280
Sleep tight, Charles.
