1
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:03,400
Jack?
Jack?

2
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:07,930
Jack!
Jack!

3
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:15,500
Jack?
Jack?

4
00:00:18,710 --> 00:00:21,020
Jack, I need you to wake up.

5
00:00:22,770 --> 00:00:23,890
Jack!
Jack!

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,170
Can you hear me?

7
00:00:31,430 --> 00:00:32,530
You okay?

8
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:35,940
Come on! come on! I just wanna know why.

9
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:37,450
What happened?

10
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:39,050
He knows somethin'!

11
00:00:39,770 --> 00:00:42,590
I want the truth! I don't know. that's the truth.

12
00:00:42,590 --> 00:00:45,080
I'm telling you, I don't know why, but there's no signal now. signal?

13
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:48,200
What, there was a signal when you called them last night. that's right.

14
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:50,350
So--so--so what? now they're just ignoring us?

15
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:52,470
How are we supposed to know why they're not answering?

16
00:00:52,470 --> 00:00:53,970
Oh, who's talking to you? and in case you haven't noticed,

17
00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:56,430
We're not on the bloody boat, are we? just watch your tone, red.

18
00:00:56,430 --> 00:00:57,730
I just wanna know why. hey!

19
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:01,250
Everybody just needs to calm down, okay? jack,

20
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:02,610
These people are lying to us.

21
00:01:02,610 --> 00:01:05,240
I know they're lying. I know it.

22
00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:09,020
Sooner or later, their people are gonna come back for them,

23
00:01:09,530 --> 00:01:12,540
And when they do, we'll be waiting for them.

24
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:15,370
Unless they run off again. listen to me.

25
00:01:15,370 --> 00:01:17,500
Jack, are you all right? no, I'm fine.

26
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:21,910
We just have to be patient, okay?

27
00:01:22,070 --> 00:01:23,500
I've gotten us this far.

28
00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:26,580
I said I was gonna get us off the island--all of us.

29
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:29,700
I promised that I would.

30
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:33,730
Jack?  Jack?  Jack?
Jack? jack? jack?

31
00:01:33,870 --> 00:01:34,930
Jack
Jack.

32
00:01:35,380 --> 00:01:37,130
Is he all right?

33
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:39,020
Jack?
Jack?

34
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:41,410
Jack
Jack.

35
00:01:59,570 --> 00:02:00,380
Hello?

36
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:01,550
Dr. shephard?

37
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:04,720
Just confirming your 11:00 consult with ms. berenberg.

38
00:02:04,730 --> 00:02:06,070
It was moved up yesterday,

39
00:02:06,070 --> 00:02:07,960
And I know how you are with your calendar.

40
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:12,930
Yeah. yeah, I remember, jane. I'll, um... I'll be in there.

41
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,540
Thank you, doctor. all right. bye.

42
00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:36,560
Ow. son of a bitch.

43
00:02:58,740 --> 00:02:59,590
A-rod.

44
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:11,720
Morning.

45
00:03:12,230 --> 00:03:13,470
Morning yourself.

46
00:03:13,950 --> 00:03:15,360
I bought you a razor.

47
00:03:16,130 --> 00:03:17,830
What, you don't like the scruff?

48
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,890
Razor's by the sink, jack.

49
00:03:39,070 --> 00:03:40,000
Morning.

50
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:11,990
"alice took up the fan, and as the hall was very hot,

51
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:13,610
"she kept fanning herself

52
00:04:13,610 --> 00:04:15,670
"all the time she went on talking,

53
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:18,940
"'dear, dear. how queer everything is today.

54
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:22,310
"'and yesterday, things went on just as usual.

55
00:04:23,370 --> 00:04:25,630
"'i wonder if I've been changed in the night.

56
00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:28,860
Let me think. was I the same when I got up this morning?'"

57
00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:38,320
"'but if I'm not the same, the next question is,

58
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:40,210
"who in the world am i?'

59
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:43,400
Aha, that's the great puzzle."

60
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:14,290
You're a natural.

61
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:16,330
Yeah?

62
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:17,290
Yeah.

63
00:05:18,370 --> 00:05:20,240
My old man used to read me that story.

64
00:05:20,610 --> 00:05:21,400
Really?

65
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:23,280
What?

66
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:25,310
It's just...

67
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:28,940
It's just sweet hearing you say nice things about your dad.

68
00:05:30,810 --> 00:05:32,600
I don't say nice things about my dad?

69
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,340
Well, he was a good storyteller. I'll give him that.

70
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:46,670
You okay?

71
00:05:49,010 --> 00:05:49,850
Yeah.

72
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:53,710
Just, i... I love seeing you with him.

73
00:05:57,300 --> 00:05:59,260
I'm so glad you changed your mind.

74
00:06:03,890 --> 00:06:05,700
I'm so glad that you're here.

75
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:08,340
Me, too.

76
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:30,450
Keep him in the shade. I'll get him some water.

77
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:32,510
Give--give him some air, guys.

78
00:06:34,190 --> 00:06:35,160
You okay?

79
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:36,660
Yeah.

80
00:06:38,130 --> 00:06:40,220
I'm fine. I'm good. I'm good.

81
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:42,650
Hey, what happened? he passed out.

82
00:06:42,650 --> 00:06:43,710
You fainted?

83
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:47,820
I'm fine. I'm just, uh... just a little dehydrated.

84
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:49,310
No, jack. you're not okay. you're burning up.

85
00:06:49,310 --> 00:06:50,690
I'm fine. I'm fine. I just...

86
00:06:51,810 --> 00:06:54,150
Just need to get a little rest. jack--

87
00:06:54,170 --> 00:06:55,070
I'm fine.

88
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:06,300
You okay? yeah, just a bit woozy.

89
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:07,420
How's your head?

90
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:09,700
It's better. bit of a headache,

91
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:12,240
But at least I'm not seeing things anymore.

92
00:07:12,850 --> 00:07:14,020
Yeah? what'd you see?

93
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:15,780
Back off, donger.

94
00:07:15,970 --> 00:07:19,140
I'm just making conversation. let's make some time.

95
00:07:19,570 --> 00:07:21,930
I wanna cover more ground before we gotta camp tonight.

96
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:24,300
If we hoof it, we can make it to the beach by noon tomorrow.

97
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:28,610
No!

98
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:35,560
What?

99
00:07:40,950 --> 00:07:42,470
Who's danielle and karl?

100
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:46,080
Y-you mean rousseau? the french woman?

101
00:08:01,790 --> 00:08:02,620
Oh, my god.

102
00:08:05,130 --> 00:08:06,280
Is this your french woman?

103
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:17,290
Karl
Karl.

104
00:08:18,670 --> 00:08:20,220
How'd you know they were down there?

105
00:08:23,110 --> 00:08:24,490
Your buddies do this?

106
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:27,420
They're not my buddies, man.

107
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:30,950
I didn't sign up for this.

108
00:08:33,290 --> 00:08:35,990
Can we just--can we just get out of here, please? can we just go?

109
00:08:36,010 --> 00:08:38,080
Yeah, yeah, of course. but don't worry.

110
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:40,550
Once we get back to the beach, everything's gonna be fine.

111
00:08:40,990 --> 00:08:41,840
All right?

112
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:45,320
Come on.

113
00:08:45,490 --> 00:08:46,310
Let's go.

114
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:00,460
I hate being sick.

115
00:09:01,070 --> 00:09:02,320
What do you think it is?

116
00:09:02,990 --> 00:09:04,230
It's food poisoning.

117
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:06,130
What makes you think that?

118
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:10,560
I've got some cramping, dehydrated, nausea.

119
00:09:12,890 --> 00:09:14,410
I respectfully disagree.

120
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:16,670
Do you?

121
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:18,760
You want to lift your shirt up?

122
00:09:23,370 --> 00:09:26,020
If it's food poisoning, you got nothing to worry about.

123
00:09:46,710 --> 00:09:48,440
It's your appendix, jack.

124
00:09:50,770 --> 00:09:52,270
When did the pain start?

125
00:09:53,950 --> 00:09:55,030
Yesterday.

126
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:56,660
Has it ruptured?

127
00:09:57,870 --> 00:09:58,780
Not yet.

128
00:10:01,030 --> 00:10:01,870
Well...

129
00:10:03,930 --> 00:10:06,110
I guess we're just gonna have to take it out.

130
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:12,140
Do you remember where the medical station is?

131
00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:13,820
-Or don't you? -Yes, I remember.

132
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:15,780
These are the instruments that I need you to bring back.

133
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:20,680
-You'll find them in the drawers in the exam room. -"clamps"? sutures"?

134
00:10:20,690 --> 00:10:22,340
Juliet, I don't know what these look like.

135
00:10:22,770 --> 00:10:26,600
I can help you. I'm familiar with surgical instruments. 

136
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:28,840
I thought you were a physicist. Yeah, well,

137
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:31,910
I've done some animal autopsies, too, so if--if-- no.

138
00:10:32,190 --> 00:10:35,240
We can't trust them. -See, Dan? I told you.

139
00:10:35,470 --> 00:10:37,030
They're convinced we're trying to kill 'em.

140
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:39,630
-Might as well keep playing the part. -Damn it, charlotte.

141
00:10:39,630 --> 00:10:41,300
That right there, that right there.

142
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:44,290
Your--your attitude-- your very bad attitude--

143
00:10:44,370 --> 00:10:46,430
It's exactly why they don't trust us.

144
00:10:47,510 --> 00:10:48,340
Come on.

145
00:10:48,930 --> 00:10:50,340
Juliet, please.

146
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:54,430
Don't blame us for--for this, for whatever is happening.

147
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:56,650
We're scientists. We don't want anyone to get hurt.

148
00:10:56,650 --> 00:10:59,360
We just wanna help. Please let us help.

149
00:11:03,510 --> 00:11:06,090
Either of them tries to run? Shoot 'em in the leg.

150
00:11:08,190 --> 00:11:10,010
Get back here as fast as you can. Okay.

151
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:11,520
Thank you.

152
00:11:13,460 --> 00:11:15,580
We need to create a sterile environment.

153
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:17,660
Find a hard surface, wash it down,

154
00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:19,280
Gather as many tarps as you can.

155
00:11:20,890 --> 00:11:21,830
Hey, juliet.

156
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:25,400
If everything that we need is at the medical station,

157
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:27,880
-Then why don't we just bring jack there? -Because if we move him,

158
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:30,260
There's a good chance that his appendix will rupture.

159
00:11:30,530 --> 00:11:33,340
And if that happens, he's gonna die.

160
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,550
Don't even think about it.

161
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:52,160
What?

162
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:57,240
Don't look at her. Don't talk to her.

163
00:11:57,980 --> 00:11:59,340
Don't mess with her.

164
00:12:00,770 --> 00:12:03,580
You got a restraining order. 20 feet.

165
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:05,300
What are you, her big brother?

166
00:12:05,510 --> 00:12:09,190
No. I'm the guy who's gonna put a boot in your face

167
00:12:09,190 --> 00:12:10,980
Unless you say, "yeah. I getcha."

168
00:12:11,530 --> 00:12:12,700
Yeah. I getcha.

169
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:27,150
Honey, I am sure Jack is gonna be okay.

170
00:12:28,310 --> 00:12:29,340
An appendectomy

171
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:32,400
Is just about the most common kind of surgery there is.

172
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:33,930
That's not what I was thinking about.

173
00:12:33,930 --> 00:12:36,900
I was thinking, "why did he get sick?"

174
00:12:37,330 --> 00:12:39,360
Why? It's just-- it's just bad luck.

175
00:12:39,510 --> 00:12:41,570
The day before we're all supposed to be rescued,

176
00:12:41,570 --> 00:12:43,200
The person that we count on the most

177
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:45,360
Suddenly comes down with a life-threatening condition,

178
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:48,100
-And you're chalking it up to bad luck? -Well, what are you saying,

179
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:51,310
That--that Jack did something to offend the gods?

180
00:12:51,490 --> 00:12:54,550
People get sick, Rose. -Not here.

181
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:58,990
Here, they get better.

182
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:11,240
When was the last time you did this?

183
00:13:11,430 --> 00:13:13,910
An appendectomy or shaving a man's stomach?

184
00:13:17,370 --> 00:13:18,580
In my residency.

185
00:13:19,670 --> 00:13:21,560
I did a lot of 'em back then.

186
00:13:26,090 --> 00:13:27,960
Then you know the incision needs to be

187
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:30,320
2 inches lower than where you're shaving.

188
00:13:30,610 --> 00:13:32,390
I'm just cleaning the area.

189
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:33,370
Thank you.

190
00:13:39,170 --> 00:13:40,780
I wanna talk you through it.

191
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:42,670
What?

192
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:44,550
I don't want to be unconscious.

193
00:13:44,550 --> 00:13:46,870
We can use the lidocaine

194
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:48,530
To numb the area.

195
00:13:48,890 --> 00:13:51,880
And then I can watch the procedure,

196
00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:53,750
Help you out.

197
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:56,430
And, uh, how are you gonna watch

198
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:59,680
Flat on your back with my hand in your abdominal cavity?

199
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:03,410
We can use a mirror. kate can hold it.

200
00:14:08,090 --> 00:14:09,780
If someone's going to be in there,

201
00:14:09,860 --> 00:14:11,960
Shouldn't it be someone with medical experience?

202
00:14:11,970 --> 00:14:14,130
-Bernard's a dentist-- -No, I want it to be kate.

203
00:14:18,810 --> 00:14:19,610
Okay.

204
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:25,500
Don't worry, Ms. berenberg. You're in good hands.

205
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:26,390
Thank you.

206
00:14:26,570 --> 00:14:29,770
-I'll see you tomorrow at 5:00 a.m.? -Mm-hmm.

207
00:14:29,770 --> 00:14:31,830
And remember, no solid food. okay?

208
00:14:31,830 --> 00:14:33,200
-Thank you, doctor. -Have a good evening.

209
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:37,280
Jack?
Jack?

210
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:39,420
Jack?
Jack?

211
00:14:42,780 --> 00:14:44,310
Will you take a look at this x-ray?

212
00:14:44,370 --> 00:14:48,000
-Uh, it's in the L4. I wanna know what you think. -The L4. yeah. yeah.

213
00:14:48,650 --> 00:14:50,630
Oh, Dr. Shephard, there's a call for you.

214
00:14:50,650 --> 00:14:53,430
It's a dr. stillman from Santa rosa hospital,

215
00:14:53,430 --> 00:14:55,050
Says it's about a friend of yours.

216
00:14:57,050 --> 00:14:58,610
He's refusing to take his meds,

217
00:14:58,610 --> 00:14:59,830
And he's stopped sleeping.

218
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:03,080
What about his therapy sessions?

219
00:15:04,060 --> 00:15:06,840
Therapy's... been rendered useless.

220
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:09,730
And why is that?

221
00:15:10,930 --> 00:15:12,650
Because he doesn't think I exist.

222
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:25,470
Hey, hurley.

223
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:27,540
Hey, jack.

224
00:15:37,050 --> 00:15:38,630
Why aren't you taking your meds?

225
00:15:39,430 --> 00:15:40,490
Cause we're dead...

226
00:15:42,450 --> 00:15:43,460
All of us.

227
00:15:44,460 --> 00:15:46,680
All the oceanic six-- we're all dead.

228
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:49,710
We never got off that island.

229
00:15:49,710 --> 00:15:50,700
Hurley
Hurley...

230
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:53,680
That is not true.

231
00:15:54,980 --> 00:15:56,130
What'd you do today?

232
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:58,290
What did I do today?

233
00:15:58,290 --> 00:15:59,490
I, uh...

234
00:16:01,690 --> 00:16:03,960
I woke up, took a shower.

235
00:16:05,270 --> 00:16:07,340
Uh, kate and I fed the baby.

236
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:10,960
I thought you didn't want anything to do with aaron.

237
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:14,360
I changed my mind after the trial.

238
00:16:15,910 --> 00:16:16,990
Living with kate...

239
00:16:18,010 --> 00:16:19,590
Taking care of aaron...

240
00:16:20,350 --> 00:16:21,990
It all seems so perfect...

241
00:16:23,090 --> 00:16:24,130
Just like heaven.

242
00:16:26,170 --> 00:16:27,420
Just because I'm happy

243
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:30,260
Doesn't mean that this isn't real, hurley.

244
00:16:30,270 --> 00:16:31,840
I was happy, too, jack...

245
00:16:33,450 --> 00:16:34,640
For a while, anyway.

246
00:16:38,010 --> 00:16:39,350
Then I saw charlie.

247
00:16:43,630 --> 00:16:45,320
He likes to sit with me on the bench

248
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:46,710
Out on the front lawn.

249
00:16:48,130 --> 00:16:49,680
It's pretty cool, actually.

250
00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:57,080
Okay.  so what do the two of you talk about?

251
00:16:57,490 --> 00:17:00,000
Well, yesterday, he told me you were gonna be coming by.

252
00:17:02,550 --> 00:17:04,800
He wanted me to give you a message.

253
00:17:05,310 --> 00:17:06,180
A message?

254
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:13,890
He made me write it down so I wouldn't mess it up.

255
00:17:18,210 --> 00:17:20,540
"you're not supposed to raise him, jack."

256
00:17:23,350 --> 00:17:24,780
Does that make any sense?

257
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:29,150
No, that... doesn't make any sense.

258
00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:31,370
Do you think he means aaron?

259
00:17:40,390 --> 00:17:42,000
Take your meds, hurley.

260
00:17:43,110 --> 00:17:44,270
Just take 'em.

261
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:46,840
Hey, jack?

262
00:17:49,870 --> 00:17:52,500
Charlie said someone's gonna be visiting you, too.

263
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:56,250
Soon.

264
00:18:08,910 --> 00:18:09,690
We're here.

265
00:18:25,650 --> 00:18:27,830
Why don't you let me go first?

266
00:18:27,830 --> 00:18:30,750
Um, you know, make sure everything's safe.

267
00:18:32,390 --> 00:18:33,200
Okay.

268
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:35,480
Be careful, dan.

269
00:18:35,930 --> 00:18:37,040
Absolutely.

270
00:18:38,670 --> 00:18:40,660
Do you think she knows he likes her?

271
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:43,550
She's a woman. She knows.

272
00:18:44,930 --> 00:18:45,930
Jin. Come on.

273
00:18:52,220 --> 00:18:54,670
Where do you suppose all this power's coming from?

274
00:18:54,950 --> 00:18:56,630
Add that one to the list, dan.

275
00:18:57,060 --> 00:18:59,050
Let's just grab the equipment and go, shall we?

276
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:06,450
Are you all right?

277
00:19:07,410 --> 00:19:09,250
This is where Juliet brought me.

278
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:11,900
This is where I saw our baby.

279
00:19:18,230 --> 00:19:21,540
They're not going to help us, Jin.

280
00:19:25,180 --> 00:19:26,780
Don't worry about them.

281
00:19:27,210 --> 00:19:28,710
I promise you Sun.

282
00:19:29,730 --> 00:19:32,640
I will get you and our baby off this island.

283
00:19:46,090 --> 00:19:48,330
Whoa! hey, you want a hand with the baby?

284
00:19:48,430 --> 00:19:50,020
Oh, no, thanks. I'm fine.

285
00:19:50,030 --> 00:19:53,230
You sure? I'm good with kids. what part of "restraining order"

286
00:19:53,230 --> 00:19:54,500
Don't you understand?

287
00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:00,130
Get behind me, claire.

288
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:12,290
Who the hell are you?

289
00:20:12,310 --> 00:20:14,420
-Lapidus?  -Miles?
Lapidus? miles?

290
00:20:15,150 --> 00:20:16,360
You two know each other?

291
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:18,970
You gotta hide, man, right now. what?

292
00:20:19,170 --> 00:20:20,500
Keamy's coming back,

293
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:22,700
And if he sees you, he'll kill all of ya.

294
00:20:22,710 --> 00:20:24,850
And he's close, man. you gotta hide now!

295
00:20:24,950 --> 00:20:26,610
Go! hide! come on.

296
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:27,570
Just hide!

297
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:29,400
Come on. come on. let's go!

298
00:20:35,590 --> 00:20:37,960
Where's the chopper? it's about a click back that way.

299
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:40,410
Did you bring the kit? yeah, it's right here.

300
00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:42,760
Jeez, man, he looks bad. what the hell happened?

301
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:44,500
You do your job. I'll do mine.

302
00:20:56,430 --> 00:20:57,270
Okay.

303
00:20:57,550 --> 00:20:58,830
It's gettin' dark, man.

304
00:20:59,540 --> 00:21:00,800
We gotta leave now.

305
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:03,910
Mr. keamy, we gotta get back to the chopper.

306
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:06,450
Keamy, we gotta get back, cause I'll tell ya right now,

307
00:21:06,450 --> 00:21:08,420
I am not flying faraday's bearings at night.

308
00:21:08,420 --> 00:21:09,290
I'm not gonna do it.

309
00:21:09,290 --> 00:21:11,620
So if you wanna get back, we gotta leave right now, sir.

310
00:21:13,030 --> 00:21:15,350
Fine. you lead the way.

311
00:21:17,590 --> 00:21:18,270
Come on.

312
00:21:20,510 --> 00:21:22,180
Okay. come on.

313
00:21:25,270 --> 00:21:26,070
Watch it now.

314
00:21:30,430 --> 00:21:31,860
The tent's all set. everything's ready.

315
00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:32,800
Good. thanks.

316
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:34,540
Listen, I could use an extra pair of hands in there.

317
00:21:34,540 --> 00:21:39,480
You wanna help me out? um, I don't... I don't think that's a good idea.

318
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:40,750
It's just holding a mirror.

319
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:43,090
Jack wants to watch the surgery, "talk me through it."

320
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:45,760
What?

321
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:47,370
I'm just surprised

322
00:21:47,370 --> 00:21:49,200
He's not taking it out of himself by now.

323
00:21:52,170 --> 00:21:53,050
Jack
Jack.

324
00:21:53,930 --> 00:21:54,880
What are you doin'?

325
00:21:55,010 --> 00:21:58,070
I don't need a stretcher. I can walk 50 feet. I'll help you.

326
00:21:59,510 --> 00:22:01,420
They're gonna be back with the instruments soon.

327
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:03,540
We need to be ready to go as soon as they get back.

328
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:05,170
See you in there.

329
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:14,280
So it looks like I'm gonna be your nurse.

330
00:22:16,570 --> 00:22:17,820
Wouldn't be the first time.

331
00:22:22,930 --> 00:22:23,950
Listen, um...

332
00:22:25,110 --> 00:22:27,360
If something happens to me-- shut up, Jack.

333
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:31,110
Fair enough.

334
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:02,760
Kate?
Kate?

335
00:23:04,770 --> 00:23:05,620
Kate?
Kate?

336
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:09,950
Wake up, Kate.

337
00:23:14,070 --> 00:23:15,150
What time is it?

338
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:17,770
It's late. I just got home.

339
00:23:19,430 --> 00:23:20,500
Were you working?

340
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:23,090
No. i...

341
00:23:23,090 --> 00:23:25,310
I just... had to stop and get something.

342
00:23:25,310 --> 00:23:26,720
It just took a while.

343
00:23:29,590 --> 00:23:31,010
What's going on? what's wrong?

344
00:23:33,340 --> 00:23:36,590
The other night, when I was reading to aaron,

345
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:37,560
You said...

346
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:40,090
That I was a natural.

347
00:23:42,670 --> 00:23:43,750
Do you really...

348
00:23:46,460 --> 00:23:49,350
Do you really think that I'm good at this?

349
00:23:53,830 --> 00:23:54,730
Yeah.

350
00:23:55,730 --> 00:23:57,310
You're good at this.

351
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:16,180
Will you marry me?

352
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:43,650
Yes.

353
00:24:50,930 --> 00:24:52,620
Of course I will. yes.

354
00:25:12,460 --> 00:25:13,430
Look, they're back.

355
00:25:16,630 --> 00:25:17,680
Did you find everything?

356
00:25:17,810 --> 00:25:19,880
Yes, ma'am. entire list.

357
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:21,550
Is he okay?

358
00:25:21,590 --> 00:25:24,170
For now. sun, we need to sterilize these.

359
00:25:24,170 --> 00:25:25,950
There's a pot of water boiling over here.

360
00:25:26,870 --> 00:25:27,760
Charlotte
Charlotte.

361
00:25:28,380 --> 00:25:29,260
Yeah?

362
00:25:30,050 --> 00:25:31,570
I konw you understand me.

363
00:25:32,690 --> 00:25:33,360
Pardon?

364
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:35,120
I know you speak Korean.

365
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:39,290
You smiled when Sun and I talked about you

366
00:25:40,430 --> 00:25:43,090
And you were listening to us at the station

367
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:45,840
I'm sorry.

368
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:47,470
Perhaps I can get your wife to translate--

369
00:25:47,470 --> 00:25:48,650
If you continue to lie...

370
00:25:48,650 --> 00:25:50,550
I'm going to hurt your friend Daniel.

371
00:25:53,420 --> 00:25:57,570
I'm going to break his fingers one at a time.

372
00:26:01,270 --> 00:26:02,560
Do you understand that?

373
00:26:04,790 --> 00:26:06,350
What do you want?

374
00:26:12,130 --> 00:26:13,890
When the helicopter comes for you...

375
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:16,450
You're going to take my wife off this island.

376
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:21,700
What about you and the rest of your friends?

377
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:23,670
Just get her on the helicopter.

378
00:26:50,740 --> 00:26:51,630
You know, Jack,

379
00:26:51,630 --> 00:26:53,740
They found some chloroform at the medical station.

380
00:26:53,740 --> 00:26:55,020
I could knock you out.

381
00:26:55,410 --> 00:26:57,960
Wouldn't you rather be dreaming about something nice back home?

382
00:26:57,980 --> 00:27:00,920
No, I'll manage with the lidocaine.

383
00:27:03,550 --> 00:27:04,330
Kate
Kate.

384
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,160
Just hold it right there.

385
00:27:11,110 --> 00:27:13,760
Okay, now this is gonna numb the area of the first incision.

386
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:16,760
After that, I would like to be able to tell you

387
00:27:16,770 --> 00:27:20,680
You're not gonna feel a thing, but... you will.

388
00:27:24,010 --> 00:27:25,070
You ready?

389
00:27:29,780 --> 00:27:32,350
Okay. here we go.

390
00:27:57,150 --> 00:27:58,530
Okay, Jack. one more.

391
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:00,960
Oh! okay, try not to move.

392
00:28:02,540 --> 00:28:04,050
Just stay still.

393
00:28:04,290 --> 00:28:06,790
Spreader. Kate, i-i can't see it.

394
00:28:06,820 --> 00:28:09,460
Sorry. don't worry about the mirror. just stay still. spreader.

395
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:11,590
That's good. that's good. yeah.

396
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:14,100
This is it.

397
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:16,480
That's good.

398
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:22,820
Knock him out, bernard. no! no. hey.

399
00:28:23,170 --> 00:28:25,290
Not wanna be unconscious.

400
00:28:25,310 --> 00:28:27,370
You don't want to be out of control. Kate.

401
00:28:27,420 --> 00:28:29,960
Kate, you need to leave. bernard! no. Kate.

402
00:28:29,970 --> 00:28:33,020
Kate, you need to go. bernard! please. no!

403
00:28:33,020 --> 00:28:35,040
Kate, get out of here! bernard. Kate...

404
00:28:35,060 --> 00:28:36,300
-Jack -Kate
Jack. Kate.

405
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:38,960
Kate, get outta here! damn it, bernard! knock him out!

406
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:40,770
I'm sorry, Jack, but I agree.

407
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:53,080
Ryan Laker
Laker, ryan.

408
00:28:53,230 --> 00:28:55,040
Patient is male, 36.

409
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:58,790
Osteoblastoma is present

410
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:01,030
In the posterior area of the lumbar.

411
00:29:01,330 --> 00:29:03,670
I am recommending biopsy for...

412
00:29:49,850 --> 00:29:50,700
Jack?
Jack?

413
00:30:09,210 --> 00:30:10,050
Jack?
Jack?

414
00:30:21,390 --> 00:30:22,440
You okay?

415
00:30:22,530 --> 00:30:25,030
Uh, yeah. I'm--i'm... I'm okay.

416
00:30:25,630 --> 00:30:26,830
I, uh...

417
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:29,960
I just, uh...

418
00:30:30,940 --> 00:30:33,900
The, um, the smoke detector was...

419
00:30:34,130 --> 00:30:36,370
Was beeping, and I just...

420
00:30:37,980 --> 00:30:39,820
Okay. thank you for keeping us safe.

421
00:30:42,460 --> 00:30:43,620
Erika, um...

422
00:30:45,630 --> 00:30:46,910
Do you mind doing me a favor?

423
00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:48,030
Yeah, sure.

424
00:30:48,370 --> 00:30:50,100
Can you write a script for...

425
00:30:51,060 --> 00:30:52,240
Clonazepam?

426
00:30:53,150 --> 00:30:54,090
For you?

427
00:30:54,170 --> 00:30:57,300
Yeah, um... I just got a lot going on right now,

428
00:30:57,690 --> 00:31:00,280
And I'm just a little snowed under

429
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:03,280
With all my caseload, and Kate and I got engaged.

430
00:31:03,770 --> 00:31:08,570
Just... not sleepin' very well at night, you know? just...

431
00:31:11,660 --> 00:31:12,630
Thank you.

432
00:31:13,910 --> 00:31:14,910
You know, getting engaged

433
00:31:14,910 --> 00:31:17,780
Is supposed to help reduce stress, not create it.

434
00:31:18,310 --> 00:31:20,830
Yeah. you're right.

435
00:31:22,460 --> 00:31:24,010
Maybe you should talk to someone.

436
00:31:25,150 --> 00:31:26,390
I'll do that.

437
00:31:27,670 --> 00:31:28,600
Good night.

438
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:29,700
Good night.

439
00:31:41,810 --> 00:31:42,930
Yeah, I'll just have the nanny stay

440
00:31:42,930 --> 00:31:44,170
For an extra couple hours.

441
00:31:44,790 --> 00:31:46,680
Jack's never home before 8:00 anyway.

442
00:31:49,690 --> 00:31:51,270
I could stay for at least an hour.

443
00:31:54,410 --> 00:31:57,220
I-i gotta go. Jack's home. Yeah, okay.

444
00:31:57,300 --> 00:31:59,520
I'll call you later. Bye.

445
00:32:01,290 --> 00:32:02,080
Hey.

446
00:32:02,170 --> 00:32:03,820
Hey.You scared me.

447
00:32:04,550 --> 00:32:06,910
Sorry. I thought you'd be in bed.

448
00:32:08,650 --> 00:32:09,520
Who was that?

449
00:32:09,790 --> 00:32:10,960
That was Noreen.

450
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:13,760
Noreen?
Noreen?

451
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:16,630
Yeah. She's one of the moms from the park.

452
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:21,840
What?

453
00:32:22,530 --> 00:32:23,850
Nothing. I just...

454
00:32:24,860 --> 00:32:26,480
Never heard you mention her before.

455
00:32:26,750 --> 00:32:27,940
Well, now you have.

456
00:32:32,180 --> 00:32:33,380
I'll see you upstairs.

457
00:33:43,820 --> 00:33:45,000
Dad?

458
00:33:52,860 --> 00:33:53,600
Hey.

459
00:33:55,530 --> 00:33:56,310
Don't worry.

460
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:58,540
It went well.

461
00:34:00,030 --> 00:34:01,230
She did good.

462
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:05,510
She said you could go back inside if you want to.

463
00:34:07,470 --> 00:34:08,270
Thank you.

464
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:09,380
Okay.

465
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:27,250
He didn't lose that much blood.

466
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,290
I got the appendix out

467
00:34:29,410 --> 00:34:32,020
And put everything back where it belongs, I think.

468
00:34:34,070 --> 00:34:35,400
So he's gonna be okay?

469
00:34:35,590 --> 00:34:36,860
He should be fine.

470
00:34:37,870 --> 00:34:40,010
We just have to talk him into resting.

471
00:34:40,150 --> 00:34:41,400
Good luck with that.

472
00:34:43,230 --> 00:34:44,850
I'm sorry I yelled at you.

473
00:34:45,410 --> 00:34:46,640
Don't worry about it.

474
00:34:46,930 --> 00:34:48,570
You had enough going on.

475
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:55,880
You know, he kissed me.

476
00:34:57,060 --> 00:34:58,020
What?

477
00:34:58,940 --> 00:35:00,480
The other day, when you came back

478
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:02,670
From the other side of the island, Jack kissed me.

479
00:35:05,230 --> 00:35:06,080
Oh.

480
00:35:06,930 --> 00:35:07,970
It was nice.

481
00:35:10,130 --> 00:35:12,630
But it wasn't for me. it was for him.

482
00:35:13,350 --> 00:35:15,510
I'm pretty sure he was trying to prove something.

483
00:35:16,690 --> 00:35:17,590
Prove what?

484
00:35:21,660 --> 00:35:23,570
That he doesn't love someone else.

485
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:35,370
Thank you, Juliet.

486
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:41,350
Thank you for saving his life.

487
00:35:54,410 --> 00:35:55,670
I know you're awake.

488
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:09,370
Hey.

489
00:36:12,700 --> 00:36:13,380
Hey.

490
00:36:15,180 --> 00:36:16,360
You're home early.

491
00:36:16,900 --> 00:36:17,990
Where's Veronica?

492
00:36:18,090 --> 00:36:19,210
I sent her home.

493
00:36:20,250 --> 00:36:21,610
The baby's asleep.

494
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:24,120
Good.

495
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:28,670
Why was she here?

496
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:34,070
Sorry?

497
00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:37,450
The nanny.

498
00:36:38,390 --> 00:36:40,090
She only works till 4:00.

499
00:36:40,870 --> 00:36:42,590
I came home at 6:00.

500
00:36:43,460 --> 00:36:45,770
I had to run some errands, so...

501
00:36:46,420 --> 00:36:48,320
I asked her to stay a couple extra hours.

502
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:53,840
What's going on, Jack?

503
00:36:57,410 --> 00:36:58,950
Why are you home so early?

504
00:37:00,310 --> 00:37:02,110
I went to see Hurley.

505
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:04,880
Today?

506
00:37:05,630 --> 00:37:07,320
Last friday.

507
00:37:08,810 --> 00:37:10,950
Why didn't you tell me? I would've gone with you.

508
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:16,820
Because he's crazy, Kate,

509
00:37:16,950 --> 00:37:19,030
And I didn't wanna upset you.

510
00:37:24,150 --> 00:37:25,580
Where were you today?

511
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:36,610
I'm gonna ask you...

512
00:37:37,620 --> 00:37:38,790
To trust me.

513
00:37:40,510 --> 00:37:42,580
Trust me. Just leave it be.

514
00:37:49,340 --> 00:37:50,330
Where were you?

515
00:37:56,070 --> 00:37:57,070
Jack, don't.

516
00:37:57,150 --> 00:37:59,050
No, I heard you on the phone last night.

517
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:01,390
Who were you talking to?

518
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:04,330
Just let it go.

519
00:38:04,550 --> 00:38:07,610
-No, no, I wanna know. -No, jack.

520
00:38:07,610 --> 00:38:10,450
I wanna know where you were. I wanna know who you were with.

521
00:38:10,450 --> 00:38:11,440
It doesn't matter, Jack. please.

522
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:13,420
No, tell me. Tell me!

523
00:38:17,170 --> 00:38:18,960
I was doing something for him.

524
00:38:20,580 --> 00:38:21,480
For who?

525
00:38:23,290 --> 00:38:24,360
For Sawyer.

526
00:38:29,020 --> 00:38:30,490
I made him a promise.

527
00:38:33,190 --> 00:38:33,780
It...

528
00:38:37,060 --> 00:38:37,930
What?

529
00:38:37,990 --> 00:38:40,580
It doesn't matter. It has nothing to do with us.

530
00:38:40,990 --> 00:38:42,890
Then why won't you tell me?

531
00:38:42,890 --> 00:38:45,590
Because--because he wouldn't want me to.

532
00:38:46,890 --> 00:38:49,620
But he's not here, is he? no.

533
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:51,890
No, he made his choice.

534
00:38:51,910 --> 00:38:53,400
He chose to stay.

535
00:38:55,150 --> 00:38:56,680
I'm the one who came back.

536
00:38:58,040 --> 00:38:59,820
I'm the one who's here.

537
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:02,980
I'm the one who saved you.

538
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:07,360
Jack
Jack.

539
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:12,570
You can't-- you can't do this.

540
00:39:12,970 --> 00:39:15,300
If you have problems, you need to figure them out.

541
00:39:15,430 --> 00:39:18,370
All right? 'cause I can't have you like this around my son.

542
00:39:19,390 --> 00:39:20,680
Your son?

543
00:39:21,730 --> 00:39:23,880
You're not even related to him!

544
00:39:33,710 --> 00:39:34,780
Hey, sweet pea.

545
00:39:35,750 --> 00:39:36,470
Hey.

546
00:40:07,450 --> 00:40:08,200
Morning.

547
00:40:08,980 --> 00:40:10,930
It's way too early for chinese.

548
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:15,210
Where's Claire?

549
00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:17,380
Ladies' room?

550
00:40:17,900 --> 00:40:18,710
Nope.

551
00:40:19,870 --> 00:40:21,690
She just walked off into the jungle.

552
00:40:23,870 --> 00:40:24,680
What?

553
00:40:26,250 --> 00:40:27,040
When?

554
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:30,110
In the middle of the night. Just got up and left.

555
00:40:30,130 --> 00:40:32,610
-You let her go alone? -She wasn't alone.

556
00:40:33,030 --> 00:40:34,390
Well, who was she with?

557
00:40:35,450 --> 00:40:38,680
She called him "dad." I'd have followed them,

558
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:41,350
But I have a restraining order.

559
00:40:48,490 --> 00:40:49,340
Claire!
Claire!

560
00:40:50,270 --> 00:40:51,160
Claire!
Claire!

561
00:41:10,150 --> 00:41:11,810
It's okay. It's okay.

562
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:13,140
I've got you.

563
00:41:17,780 --> 00:41:18,510
Claire!
Claire!

564
00:41:24,270 --> 00:41:25,030
Claire!
Claire!

565
00:41:29,940 --> 00:41:30,870
Claire!
Claire!

566
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:34,920
Claire!
Claire!
