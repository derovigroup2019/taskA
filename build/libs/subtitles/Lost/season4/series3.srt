1
00:00:02,156 --> 00:00:04,195
<i>Previously on Lost:</i>

2
00:00:07,035 --> 00:00:10,819
- You killed Naomi!
- She wants her people to come here.

3
00:00:10,873 --> 00:00:13,660
And trust me, when they do,
we had better be far away from here.

4
00:00:13,709 --> 00:00:16,247
If you want to live,
you need to come with me.

5
00:00:27,431 --> 00:00:29,174
- Who are you?
- Daniel Faraday.

6
00:00:29,224 --> 00:00:30,766
I'm here to rescue you.

7
00:00:30,809 --> 00:00:33,976
This is the team? These are the
wrong people for a mission like this.

8
00:00:34,021 --> 00:00:36,856
None of them have field experience,
military training.

9
00:00:36,899 --> 00:00:39,983
You can't drop them in unprotected.
There's only so much I can do.

10
00:00:40,027 --> 00:00:42,648
Where's the chopper?
Where did it crash?

11
00:00:42,696 --> 00:00:46,445
What kind of pilot do you think I am?
I put her down safe and sound.

12
00:00:46,492 --> 00:00:49,113
- Get up. You're coming with us.
- We need to stay where we are

13
00:00:49,161 --> 00:00:51,913
- so they can find us.
- See, there's your problem.

14
00:00:51,955 --> 00:00:53,580
We don't want to be found.

15
00:00:53,624 --> 00:00:56,411
You want to know why we're here?
I'll tell you why.

16
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:58,998
We're here for Benjamin Linus.

17
00:00:59,046 --> 00:01:01,252
Now where is he?

18
00:01:21,568 --> 00:01:24,605
Did Ben mention knowing
anyone off the island?

19
00:01:24,655 --> 00:01:26,943
- You're sure of that?
- This is real simple.

20
00:01:26,990 --> 00:01:29,149
Do you know where he is, or don't you?

21
00:01:29,201 --> 00:01:32,202
- What do you want with him?
- I want to locate him.

22
00:01:32,246 --> 00:01:35,200
The people who hired me told me
his name's Benjamin Linus.

23
00:01:35,249 --> 00:01:37,740
They gave me this picture,
that's all he told me.

24
00:01:37,793 --> 00:01:40,414
They said find him.
And for what they're paying me,

25
00:01:40,462 --> 00:01:42,336
I don't need to know anything else.

26
00:01:43,215 --> 00:01:44,590
Do you?

27
00:01:46,176 --> 00:01:50,256
You want Ben? OK, he's with Locke
and your friend...

28
00:01:50,305 --> 00:01:51,965
- Charlotte.
- Charlotte.

29
00:01:52,015 --> 00:01:54,637
Locke's got her too.
We know where he's heading.

30
00:01:54,685 --> 00:01:58,813
Locke's the guy that killed Naomi.
Give me back my gun, Shephard.

31
00:01:58,856 --> 00:02:01,347
You want your gun back, I want answers.

32
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:03,309
You don't trust me, I don't trust you.

33
00:02:05,028 --> 00:02:08,777
You're supposed to be dead.
Am I asking a billion questions? No.

34
00:02:08,824 --> 00:02:11,908
We both have the same problem,
this Locke guy.

35
00:02:11,952 --> 00:02:15,403
Even if Locke has your friend,
you can't waltz in there and grab her.

36
00:02:15,455 --> 00:02:17,993
- They're armed.
- How about that? So are we.

37
00:02:18,041 --> 00:02:20,912
- Why don't we move out?
- You're not going anywhere.

38
00:02:20,961 --> 00:02:24,460
- Will that helicopter fly?
- It's what she does.

39
00:02:24,506 --> 00:02:27,591
- Then you can take me to your ship.
- Sayid, wait a second.

40
00:02:27,634 --> 00:02:30,884
We did call these people
to get us off this island, didn't we?

41
00:02:33,307 --> 00:02:35,098
Well?

42
00:02:35,142 --> 00:02:38,178
I burned a lot of fuel coming in.
I can't carry much weight.

43
00:02:38,228 --> 00:02:40,766
- I'll take three of you.
- In case you zoned out

44
00:02:40,814 --> 00:02:44,349
while tweezing your goatee, one
of these yahoos took Charlotte prisoner.

45
00:02:44,401 --> 00:02:46,524
I can bring her back safely.

46
00:02:50,574 --> 00:02:54,524
And if I do...
will you take me to the ship?

47
00:02:55,913 --> 00:02:57,193
Absolutely.

48
00:02:59,666 --> 00:03:01,908
You bring Charlotte back safe...

49
00:03:03,295 --> 00:03:05,584
...and I will take you off this island.

50
00:03:28,028 --> 00:03:30,068
- Good morning.
- Morning.

51
00:03:30,113 --> 00:03:33,648
It's a long walk to the next hole.
Do you need a ride?

52
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:36,405
Thank you, but no.
My ball is right here.

53
00:03:36,453 --> 00:03:39,288
You're the first person I've seen
out here all morning.

54
00:03:40,541 --> 00:03:43,874
I believe we're paying quite a premium
for that kind of privacy.

55
00:03:43,919 --> 00:03:46,161
Indeed, we are.

56
00:03:49,216 --> 00:03:51,458
Is this your first time
in the Seychelles?

57
00:03:55,305 --> 00:03:56,634
I'd use the five iron.

58
00:03:57,683 --> 00:03:59,426
I think I'll stick with the seven.

59
00:03:59,476 --> 00:04:04,268
Tell you what. 50 euros says mine
goes closer to the pin with a five.

60
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:09,437
Let's make it 100.

61
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:14,532
Amazing, huh? How we wager.

62
00:04:14,575 --> 00:04:16,484
Makes just about anything more fun.

63
00:04:32,092 --> 00:04:33,421
Not bad.

64
00:04:33,469 --> 00:04:34,797
Not bad.

65
00:04:36,221 --> 00:04:39,804
So, what do you do for a living,
my friend?

66
00:04:40,726 --> 00:04:43,395
- I do nothing.
- Nothing?

67
00:04:43,437 --> 00:04:45,264
Doesn't pay for a vacation here.

68
00:04:46,106 --> 00:04:48,313
I was the recipient
of a large settlement.

69
00:04:48,358 --> 00:04:51,063
- Corporate merger?
- Actually a plane crash.

70
00:04:53,322 --> 00:04:55,777
Oceanic Airlines flight 815.

71
00:04:55,824 --> 00:04:57,864
I'm Sayid Jarrah...

72
00:04:57,910 --> 00:05:00,531
...one of the Oceanic Six.

73
00:05:04,458 --> 00:05:05,620
That's...

74
00:05:05,667 --> 00:05:07,707
That's amazing.

75
00:05:08,795 --> 00:05:11,121
I remember reading all about it.

76
00:05:11,882 --> 00:05:13,542
Take your shot, my friend.

77
00:05:26,730 --> 00:05:29,731
It appears you were right
about the five iron.

78
00:05:33,654 --> 00:05:36,489
Enjoy your round.
Don't worry about the wager.

79
00:05:37,491 --> 00:05:40,361
- It's all in good fun.
- No, you won. Allow me to pay you.

80
00:05:40,410 --> 00:05:43,246
- It's fine, thank you.
- I insist, Mr Avellino.

81
00:06:53,525 --> 00:06:55,933
"Is it free?" was the full extent
of my German.

82
00:06:58,739 --> 00:07:01,111
What are you looking for?

83
00:07:01,158 --> 00:07:04,194
I love Europe.
Everyone speaks English.

84
00:07:04,244 --> 00:07:07,613
- I'm looking for Potsdamer Platz.
- You don't need a map.

85
00:07:07,664 --> 00:07:10,120
It's one block down,
right across the street.

86
00:07:10,167 --> 00:07:12,159
Thank you.

87
00:07:16,465 --> 00:07:19,003
I'm Elsa.

88
00:07:19,051 --> 00:07:20,794
Sayid.

89
00:07:22,930 --> 00:07:24,839
Could I have an espresso, please?

90
00:07:26,350 --> 00:07:28,841
What sort of business
brings you to Berlin?

91
00:07:28,894 --> 00:07:30,554
I'm a head-hunter.

92
00:07:30,604 --> 00:07:32,146
A corporate recruiter.

93
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:36,856
- And what do you do?
- My employer is an economist.

94
00:07:36,902 --> 00:07:39,393
He works in emerging markets.

95
00:07:39,446 --> 00:07:42,198
Actually, I don't really understand
what he does,

96
00:07:42,241 --> 00:07:45,574
which doesn't matter
since all I do is shop for him.

97
00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:48,614
And if this goes off,

98
00:07:48,664 --> 00:07:51,618
I'm at his side instantly.

99
00:07:51,667 --> 00:07:55,166
Which is wonderful, since he's only
in Berlin once or twice a year.

100
00:07:55,212 --> 00:07:58,960
Which is why you're enjoying
a luxuriously long midday coffee.

101
00:08:00,467 --> 00:08:01,843
Yes.

102
00:08:17,651 --> 00:08:19,311
Do I...

103
00:08:21,071 --> 00:08:22,696
...know you from somewhere?

104
00:08:23,657 --> 00:08:26,148
I'll tell you exactly where
you know me from...

105
00:08:27,870 --> 00:08:29,661
...if you let me take you to dinner.

106
00:08:43,385 --> 00:08:46,635
This is the restaurant
you're taking me tonight. 8.00.

107
00:08:48,098 --> 00:08:50,554
Well, if you can find it.

108
00:09:08,285 --> 00:09:10,242
<i>- Hello?
- I made contact.</i>

109
00:09:10,287 --> 00:09:11,615
<i>Good.</i>

110
00:09:29,765 --> 00:09:31,093
Take a look at this.

111
00:09:32,643 --> 00:09:34,516
Naomi had it with her.

112
00:09:36,146 --> 00:09:38,139
She was looking for Desmond.

113
00:09:40,651 --> 00:09:44,185
Whatever their real agenda is
it's clear they're not sharing it.

114
00:09:44,238 --> 00:09:46,444
Maybe Desmond
can shed some light on this.

115
00:09:48,826 --> 00:09:51,151
How long would it take
to get to the beach and back?

116
00:09:51,203 --> 00:09:52,448
Couple of hours.

117
00:09:53,831 --> 00:09:55,538
You mind?

118
00:09:55,582 --> 00:09:57,622
Anything I can do to help.

119
00:09:58,836 --> 00:09:59,950
Sayid.

120
00:10:02,714 --> 00:10:04,422
So how are we gonna do this?

121
00:10:04,466 --> 00:10:07,752
You know the best candidate
for this kind of mission.

122
00:10:07,803 --> 00:10:11,468
- And what kind of mission is that?
- I'll make Locke release Charlotte,

123
00:10:11,515 --> 00:10:14,267
and I'm going to do it
without any bloodshed.

124
00:10:14,309 --> 00:10:16,847
As opposed to the way I'd do it?

125
00:10:17,563 --> 00:10:20,480
The last time you encountered him
you put a gun to his head

126
00:10:20,524 --> 00:10:21,899
and pulled the trigger.

127
00:10:21,942 --> 00:10:23,982
That's not good diplomacy.

128
00:10:24,653 --> 00:10:26,480
Hey, Jarrah.

129
00:10:27,156 --> 00:10:29,777
You think you're going
after Charlotte without me?

130
00:10:29,825 --> 00:10:31,284
Of course not.

131
00:10:32,744 --> 00:10:34,452
Well, good.

132
00:10:35,873 --> 00:10:37,664
Is there anything else?

133
00:10:39,293 --> 00:10:42,662
- Yeah. Give me my gun back.
- We leave in ten minutes.

134
00:10:49,970 --> 00:10:52,259
Ready to give us a name, Gizmo?

135
00:10:53,515 --> 00:10:56,635
He's not gonna tell you who
his spy is on their boat, James.

136
00:10:56,685 --> 00:10:58,144
Yeah, and why not?

137
00:10:58,187 --> 00:11:00,642
Because that's the only thing
keeping him alive.

138
00:11:00,689 --> 00:11:01,768
Here's an idea.

139
00:11:01,815 --> 00:11:04,567
Why don't we take a gun,
point it to his big toe

140
00:11:04,610 --> 00:11:06,733
and send that little piggy to market?

141
00:11:06,778 --> 00:11:11,025
And if he still doesn't want to tell us,
we'll move on to the roast beef.

142
00:11:11,074 --> 00:11:14,325
- Why don't we do that?
- Then we have to carry him.

143
00:11:35,015 --> 00:11:36,758
John, how much further is it?

144
00:11:36,809 --> 00:11:39,845
- I need to feed Aaron.
- It should be here, the cabin.

145
00:11:41,355 --> 00:11:43,976
Maybe we got turned around.
Could be anywhere.

146
00:11:44,024 --> 00:11:45,103
No, it was here.

147
00:11:45,150 --> 00:11:47,688
What's in this cabin
that's so important?

148
00:11:47,736 --> 00:11:50,856
John's looking for somebody
to tell him what to do next.

149
00:12:01,041 --> 00:12:03,117
I guess I was mistaken.
It doesn't...

150
00:12:03,168 --> 00:12:05,838
It doesn't matter.
Plan's the same. We keep moving.

151
00:12:05,879 --> 00:12:07,539
The barracks aren't far.

152
00:12:07,589 --> 00:12:11,753
If her team is with Jack's group,
they know we're going to the barracks.

153
00:12:11,802 --> 00:12:13,794
Yeah, and Red here was wearing a vest,

154
00:12:13,846 --> 00:12:16,882
which means her posse's gonna come
expecting a gunfight.

155
00:12:16,932 --> 00:12:19,601
If all they want is her,
maybe we should let her go.

156
00:12:19,643 --> 00:12:23,771
I thought we were just gonna go hide.
Why do we need to take prisoners?

157
00:12:23,814 --> 00:12:25,641
Because she'll be valuable.

158
00:12:25,691 --> 00:12:28,941
- How is she gonna be valuable?
- He means as a hostage, love.

159
00:12:30,571 --> 00:12:33,488
- This is not what I signed up for.
- What did you sign up for?

160
00:12:33,532 --> 00:12:37,530
If we let her go, they'll look at it
as a sign of good faith.

161
00:12:37,578 --> 00:12:39,736
They'll look at it
as an act of foolishness.

162
00:12:39,788 --> 00:12:41,781
I'm trying to come up with a compromise.

163
00:12:41,832 --> 00:12:43,871
We're beyond compromise.

164
00:12:43,917 --> 00:12:46,835
And right now, Hugo,
I'm making the decisions.

165
00:12:48,213 --> 00:12:50,918
Is that going to be a problem for you?

166
00:12:58,056 --> 00:12:59,848
Kinda sucks, huh?

167
00:13:01,393 --> 00:13:02,638
What's that?

168
00:13:04,146 --> 00:13:06,185
Being told not to come along.

169
00:13:08,734 --> 00:13:10,773
Now you know what it feels like
to be me.

170
00:13:11,987 --> 00:13:14,822
Does that mean I should
wait 20 minutes and go anyway?

171
00:13:16,742 --> 00:13:18,117
Touch?.

172
00:13:25,959 --> 00:13:27,999
You should go with them, Kate.

173
00:13:30,047 --> 00:13:31,874
- You're serious?
- Yeah.

174
00:13:35,344 --> 00:13:37,383
What, don't you trust Sayid?

175
00:13:38,222 --> 00:13:39,680
I don't trust Locke.

176
00:13:41,892 --> 00:13:45,225
What's preventing him from doing to me
what he did to Naomi?

177
00:13:48,649 --> 00:13:49,847
Sawyer won't let him.

178
00:14:02,913 --> 00:14:04,241
You got room for one more?

179
00:14:05,499 --> 00:14:07,076
Oh, yeah, she gets a gun.

180
00:14:08,544 --> 00:14:12,078
- The gun's a last resort, Kate.
- You give Locke that same speech?

181
00:14:12,130 --> 00:14:14,586
Hey! Let's move out.

182
00:14:23,475 --> 00:14:25,966
This guy, Sayid, where is he from?

183
00:14:27,855 --> 00:14:29,432
Iraq.

184
00:14:29,481 --> 00:14:31,189
Iraq?

185
00:14:32,568 --> 00:14:35,485
So he's just gonna go
and work everything out?

186
00:14:35,529 --> 00:14:37,568
What was he, a diplomat?

187
00:14:39,366 --> 00:14:40,481
No.

188
00:14:42,619 --> 00:14:44,279
No, he was a torturer.

189
00:14:56,216 --> 00:14:58,968
Naomi, were you close to her?

190
00:14:59,011 --> 00:15:01,253
Nope. Met her on the boat.

191
00:15:01,305 --> 00:15:04,056
You don't seem particularly affected
by her death.

192
00:15:04,099 --> 00:15:06,851
Sure, I'm affected. She was hot,
and I dug her accent.

193
00:15:06,894 --> 00:15:07,973
Nice.

194
00:15:08,729 --> 00:15:12,228
And this woman, Charlotte.
You don't care about her, do you?

195
00:15:12,274 --> 00:15:15,773
- Define "care".
- So much for camaraderie.

196
00:15:15,819 --> 00:15:19,188
Who's the one going after one
of their crash buddies with guns?

197
00:15:19,239 --> 00:15:21,565
Actually, I do care about Locke.

198
00:15:21,617 --> 00:15:26,195
Maybe you can tell me how he managed to
split your happy little family in half.

199
00:15:29,416 --> 00:15:33,200
There was a fundamental debate whether
your people came to rescue us...

200
00:15:33,253 --> 00:15:34,451
...or kill us.

201
00:15:35,923 --> 00:15:37,714
Which side did you land on?

202
00:15:39,468 --> 00:15:41,710
I'll let you know when I decide.

203
00:15:48,602 --> 00:15:50,642
You look fantastic.

204
00:15:53,273 --> 00:15:55,764
This is why I wanted to take you
to the opera.

205
00:16:01,198 --> 00:16:04,483
If a man can't wear his tuxedo
by the fifth date, why bother?

206
00:16:23,095 --> 00:16:24,470
You know what?

207
00:16:26,932 --> 00:16:28,759
I'm not bringing it.

208
00:16:29,393 --> 00:16:32,477
If tonight's the night he calls,
so be it.

209
00:16:37,651 --> 00:16:38,896
I'll carry it.

210
00:16:39,778 --> 00:16:42,898
If he does call,
I don't want you fired over me.

211
00:16:44,074 --> 00:16:47,028
You should tell your employer
there is newer technology.

212
00:16:47,703 --> 00:16:50,241
Oh, I've tried.
He's very old-fashioned.

213
00:16:50,289 --> 00:16:52,696
You know how bosses can be.

214
00:16:54,084 --> 00:16:55,792
Do you have a boss?

215
00:16:56,545 --> 00:16:58,584
Everyone has a boss, Elsa.

216
00:17:01,592 --> 00:17:03,631
Come on, we don't want to be late.

217
00:17:06,138 --> 00:17:08,012
Why are you still here?

218
00:17:08,056 --> 00:17:12,268
I mean, when we met, you said
you would be in Berlin for one week.

219
00:17:14,271 --> 00:17:17,521
The job I'm on is proving harder
to accomplish than I thought.

220
00:17:18,942 --> 00:17:21,065
Oh...

221
00:17:22,738 --> 00:17:23,936
...right.

222
00:17:25,032 --> 00:17:28,780
I was hoping it was because of me.

223
00:17:39,796 --> 00:17:41,172
Let's go.

224
00:17:41,215 --> 00:17:42,625
Strauss awaits.

225
00:18:20,879 --> 00:18:24,959
- What's his story?
- Daniel? Couldn't tell you.

226
00:18:25,008 --> 00:18:27,167
Half the stuff he says
goes way over my head.

227
00:18:27,219 --> 00:18:29,046
The other half goes way, way over.

228
00:18:29,930 --> 00:18:32,386
Frank, can I?

229
00:18:32,432 --> 00:18:35,766
Sorry to interrupt. May I please
use the phone just for a sec?

230
00:18:35,811 --> 00:18:38,183
- For what?
- I want to call Regina on the boat.

231
00:18:38,230 --> 00:18:41,101
Since we're waiting
maybe I can just try to...

232
00:18:41,150 --> 00:18:43,854
- What is it, Daniel?
- I'd like to do an experiment.

233
00:18:43,902 --> 00:18:45,183
- Just...
- OK.

234
00:18:45,237 --> 00:18:47,989
You just keep it to that
science stuff, all right?

235
00:18:48,031 --> 00:18:50,736
If Minkowski gets on there,
hang up right away.

236
00:18:50,784 --> 00:18:52,611
Yeah, thank you, thank you.

237
00:18:53,829 --> 00:18:55,620
<i>- Hello?
- Regina?</i>

238
00:18:55,664 --> 00:18:57,455
Hey, hi, it's Dan. Hang on.

239
00:18:58,250 --> 00:19:00,373
<i>- Can you hear me?
- Yeah.</i>

240
00:19:00,419 --> 00:19:02,246
Yeah? OK. Hang on.

241
00:19:02,296 --> 00:19:04,965
I'm... oh... Yes.

242
00:19:05,007 --> 00:19:08,707
I am all set here. I have a fix.
Are you locked in?

243
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:12,509
<i>- Getting your signal pretty clear.
- OK, great, then.</i>

244
00:19:12,556 --> 00:19:14,299
OK.

245
00:19:15,142 --> 00:19:16,553
Fire the payload.

246
00:19:16,602 --> 00:19:18,144
<i>Payload away.</i>

247
00:19:18,187 --> 00:19:21,721
Don't sweat it. He does this kind
of stuff on the boat all the time.

248
00:19:24,943 --> 00:19:27,481
<i>Forty kilometres to beacon.</i>

249
00:19:27,529 --> 00:19:29,901
<i>Thirty-five kilometres to beacon.</i>

250
00:19:29,948 --> 00:19:31,988
<i>Thirty kilometres to beacon.</i>

251
00:19:32,034 --> 00:19:34,406
<i>Twenty-five kilometres to beacon.</i>

252
00:19:34,453 --> 00:19:36,908
<i>Twenty kilometres to beacon.</i>

253
00:19:36,955 --> 00:19:39,707
<i>Fifteen kilometres to beacon.</i>

254
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:42,834
<i>- Ten kilometres to beacon.
- Regina?</i>

255
00:19:42,878 --> 00:19:45,036
<i>Five kilometres to beacon.</i>

256
00:19:45,088 --> 00:19:46,464
<i>Zero.</i>

257
00:19:46,507 --> 00:19:48,250
I don't have it.

258
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:50,458
<i>That's weird.</i>

259
00:19:52,095 --> 00:19:54,847
That is far more than weird.

260
00:20:17,204 --> 00:20:20,288
What's with the swing set?
These people had day-care?

261
00:20:20,332 --> 00:20:23,286
- You think they're here yet?
- Let's find out.

262
00:20:59,121 --> 00:21:00,829
It's coming from in there.

263
00:21:24,980 --> 00:21:26,391
Hurley, what happened?

264
00:21:28,275 --> 00:21:29,438
They left me.

265
00:21:31,111 --> 00:21:35,191
Locke's gone off the reservation, man.
He took this one chick hostage.

266
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:38,325
He said Walt was the one who
told him to kill the other chick.

267
00:21:38,368 --> 00:21:39,993
- Walt?
- Dude, don't ask.

268
00:21:40,037 --> 00:21:44,165
I was trying to argue with him
so he would chill, but...

269
00:21:44,208 --> 00:21:47,162
How about you stop babbling?
Tell us what happened to them.

270
00:21:47,211 --> 00:21:48,753
Where are they?

271
00:21:49,588 --> 00:21:52,126
- Who are you?
- Where the hell did they go, tubby?

272
00:21:52,174 --> 00:21:55,590
Oh, awesome, the ship sent us
another Sawyer.

273
00:21:55,636 --> 00:21:57,296
Hurley, where did they go?

274
00:21:57,346 --> 00:22:00,512
Guess they were too busy tying me up
to tell me. I don't know.

275
00:22:00,557 --> 00:22:03,558
- So they all left? All together?
- Yeah. They were freaked.

276
00:22:03,602 --> 00:22:07,351
Locke said the people on the ship were
coming to rescue Charlotte and kill us.

277
00:22:07,397 --> 00:22:10,185
So... are you?

278
00:22:13,362 --> 00:22:14,642
Not yet.

279
00:22:16,657 --> 00:22:20,322
Did they say anything that suggested
where they were going?

280
00:22:20,369 --> 00:22:23,654
Locke said they were going
by Ben's house before they took off.

281
00:22:23,705 --> 00:22:24,986
Why would he go there?

282
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:28,041
For all I know they could've
locked Ben in the closet too.

283
00:22:28,085 --> 00:22:29,330
Where's Ben's house?

284
00:22:36,009 --> 00:22:38,880
- You mind if I ask you a question?
- Shoot.

285
00:22:40,013 --> 00:22:42,136
Did the Red Sox really win the Series?

286
00:22:42,182 --> 00:22:45,136
Hey, don't get me started
on that, all right?

287
00:22:45,978 --> 00:22:48,469
My dad's from the Bronx.
I bleed Yankee blue.

288
00:22:50,482 --> 00:22:53,353
I can't believe it's been 100 days
since I've seen a game.

289
00:22:59,324 --> 00:23:01,068
It's the payload.

290
00:23:01,118 --> 00:23:03,110
It's finally here.

291
00:23:12,171 --> 00:23:14,840
- What is that?
- It's a rocket.

292
00:23:20,012 --> 00:23:21,387
Oh, no.

293
00:23:26,226 --> 00:23:28,100
Thirty-one minutes.

294
00:23:29,146 --> 00:23:30,688
Oh, no.

295
00:23:31,565 --> 00:23:32,763
This is not good.

296
00:23:35,694 --> 00:23:37,485
Your friends are back.

297
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:49,617
Well...

298
00:23:51,835 --> 00:23:53,164
...Iook at that.

299
00:24:06,058 --> 00:24:09,012
Look for anything that might show
where they've gone.

300
00:24:09,061 --> 00:24:10,638
I'll start in here.

301
00:26:13,685 --> 00:26:15,725
Sayid!

302
00:26:19,608 --> 00:26:21,316
Don't worry, Kate's fine.

303
00:26:28,075 --> 00:26:29,486
Good job, Hugo.

304
00:26:30,744 --> 00:26:32,488
Sorry, dude.

305
00:26:36,333 --> 00:26:39,002
I'm sorry, Sayid. Nothing personal.

306
00:26:39,044 --> 00:26:42,294
- Where's Locke?
- Talking to that angry Chinese guy.

307
00:26:43,674 --> 00:26:45,631
I'm not going to hurt you, Hurley.

308
00:26:45,676 --> 00:26:47,882
Yeah. I saw you snap that guy's neck

309
00:26:47,928 --> 00:26:50,763
with that break-dancing thing
you do with your legs.

310
00:26:50,806 --> 00:26:52,265
I think I'll hang back here.

311
00:27:01,316 --> 00:27:03,356
Well...

312
00:27:03,402 --> 00:27:05,774
...I guess they're running out
ofjail space.

313
00:27:11,493 --> 00:27:14,328
- I lost a dollar, you know.
- How'd you manage that?

314
00:27:14,371 --> 00:27:16,779
I bet John that you wouldn't be
stupid enough

315
00:27:16,832 --> 00:27:19,074
to fall for your friend as bait.

316
00:27:21,461 --> 00:27:23,584
What do you know about friendship?

317
00:27:24,339 --> 00:27:27,459
I know it's no use having friends
you can't trust.

318
00:27:35,517 --> 00:27:37,474
So I'm your prisoner?

319
00:27:38,187 --> 00:27:40,226
If that sort of thing turns you on.

320
00:27:48,697 --> 00:27:50,737
What are you doing here with Locke?

321
00:27:52,701 --> 00:27:54,859
- I'm not with him.
- Yeah, you are, James.

322
00:27:54,912 --> 00:27:57,237
- What are you doing with Jack?
- I went with Jack

323
00:27:57,289 --> 00:27:59,661
because I believe he can
get us off this island.

324
00:28:03,962 --> 00:28:06,500
Then I guess that's the difference
between us.

325
00:28:09,593 --> 00:28:11,052
I ain't lookin' to leave.

326
00:28:12,179 --> 00:28:13,887
Why not?

327
00:28:17,267 --> 00:28:19,972
'Cause I ain't got nothing
back there for me.

328
00:28:21,063 --> 00:28:23,768
And what's here that's so much better?

329
00:28:25,234 --> 00:28:27,725
Why do you want to go back, Kate?

330
00:28:29,279 --> 00:28:32,731
Seem to recall you being shuttled off
to jail before we landed here.

331
00:28:35,536 --> 00:28:39,284
So if you think there's anything
waiting for you other than handcuffs,

332
00:28:39,331 --> 00:28:42,000
then you really don't know
how the world works.

333
00:28:44,419 --> 00:28:48,038
Look around us, Freckles.
We've got roofs over our heads.

334
00:28:48,090 --> 00:28:51,957
- Electricity, showers, beds.
- How long, Sawyer?

335
00:28:52,010 --> 00:28:54,881
How long do you think
we can play house?

336
00:29:00,519 --> 00:29:02,642
Why don't we find out?

337
00:29:21,540 --> 00:29:22,703
Iced tea.

338
00:29:29,464 --> 00:29:32,465
- Thought you might be thirsty.
- I'm thirsty.

339
00:29:35,637 --> 00:29:37,879
I'm sorry about all the theatrics,

340
00:29:37,931 --> 00:29:40,553
but I didn't know
how many of you there'd be

341
00:29:40,601 --> 00:29:42,392
or whether you'd be armed.

342
00:29:42,436 --> 00:29:45,105
I had to cover my bases.

343
00:29:45,147 --> 00:29:47,104
What have you done with Miles and Kate?

344
00:29:47,149 --> 00:29:50,518
Kate's with Sawyer,
and Miles is somewhere else.

345
00:29:53,030 --> 00:29:54,275
He's fine.

346
00:29:54,323 --> 00:29:57,774
- All I did was ask him some questions.
- Did he answer any?

347
00:29:57,826 --> 00:30:00,151
- No.
- Did you have more luck with the woman?

348
00:30:02,998 --> 00:30:04,872
Not particularly.

349
00:30:06,251 --> 00:30:08,043
Why don't you turn her over to me?

350
00:30:08,086 --> 00:30:10,660
- Why would I?
- I agree these people are liars,

351
00:30:10,714 --> 00:30:13,039
and they're certainly
not here to rescue us.

352
00:30:13,091 --> 00:30:16,840
But if I return safely with Charlotte,
they'll take me to the ship.

353
00:30:16,887 --> 00:30:20,338
It's our best chance of finding out
who they are and what they want.

354
00:30:20,390 --> 00:30:23,344
Well, then, I can save you
a lot of trouble, Sayid,

355
00:30:23,393 --> 00:30:26,264
because Ben says
he's got a spy on the boat.

356
00:30:27,773 --> 00:30:29,232
Who?

357
00:30:29,274 --> 00:30:30,852
It's a secret.

358
00:30:32,152 --> 00:30:35,853
Forgive me, but the day I start
trusting him is the day I sold my soul.

359
00:30:37,157 --> 00:30:40,242
Give me Charlotte,
allow me to do things my way,

360
00:30:40,285 --> 00:30:43,868
or a war is coming which we
will both be powerless to stop.

361
00:30:43,914 --> 00:30:46,156
Why would I give you Charlotte
for nothing?

362
00:30:46,208 --> 00:30:48,580
I think you misunderstood me.

363
00:30:48,627 --> 00:30:51,544
I never expected you
to give her to me for nothing.

364
00:31:09,064 --> 00:31:11,899
- Should we get dressed?
- No.

365
00:31:14,319 --> 00:31:18,151
We're gonna have to get out
of this bed at a certain point.

366
00:31:19,283 --> 00:31:20,611
Why?

367
00:31:21,702 --> 00:31:24,193
Well, for one thing, because I know

368
00:31:24,246 --> 00:31:28,707
that eventually you're gonna have to go
to thatjob of yours, you know?

369
00:31:28,750 --> 00:31:31,704
The one you never talk about.

370
00:31:31,753 --> 00:31:34,375
There's nothing to talk about.
It's just a job.

371
00:31:37,926 --> 00:31:40,085
I know nothing about you.

372
00:31:42,681 --> 00:31:45,433
I understand you don't want
to talk about the crash,

373
00:31:45,476 --> 00:31:47,018
what happened to you.

374
00:31:47,811 --> 00:31:49,638
What about life now?

375
00:31:49,688 --> 00:31:51,396
What about you?

376
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:54,643
It's what you do
when you're in love, right? You...

377
00:31:58,614 --> 00:31:59,989
In love?

378
00:32:04,203 --> 00:32:05,946
Yeah.

379
00:32:20,886 --> 00:32:22,214
OK.

380
00:32:24,681 --> 00:32:26,341
No more secrets.

381
00:32:30,854 --> 00:32:32,183
What do you want to know?

382
00:32:39,279 --> 00:32:41,817
He's here. My boss.

383
00:32:41,865 --> 00:32:45,068
I... I have to go.

384
00:32:45,118 --> 00:32:46,198
Now?

385
00:32:48,664 --> 00:32:49,909
Where?

386
00:32:54,336 --> 00:32:56,044
The Hotel Adlon.

387
00:32:57,256 --> 00:32:58,335
My dress.

388
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:10,059
Elsa.

389
00:33:12,604 --> 00:33:14,431
You have to leave Berlin.

390
00:33:15,023 --> 00:33:16,221
What?

391
00:33:17,401 --> 00:33:19,974
- You can't be here anymore.
- What do you mean?

392
00:33:20,028 --> 00:33:23,148
- Why would I?
- People will be asking questions soon,

393
00:33:23,198 --> 00:33:25,487
about what happened to your employer.

394
00:33:27,703 --> 00:33:30,158
And you can't be around
to answer them.

395
00:33:34,459 --> 00:33:35,788
My employer?

396
00:33:40,174 --> 00:33:42,380
This is about my boss?

397
00:33:46,346 --> 00:33:48,588
- Who are you?
- It had nothing to do with...

398
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:52,259
The caf??
You meant to meet me there?

399
00:33:55,230 --> 00:33:58,433
You used me to get to my boss.
What did you say?

400
00:33:58,484 --> 00:34:00,441
People will ask
what happened to him?

401
00:34:00,486 --> 00:34:03,155
- It's best you don't know.
- You're gonna kill him?

402
00:34:07,326 --> 00:34:09,365
You're gonna kill him?

403
00:34:10,245 --> 00:34:12,238
Do you even know him?

404
00:34:13,165 --> 00:34:15,870
- His name is on a list.
- A list? What list?

405
00:34:15,918 --> 00:34:18,124
- You have a list.
- It's my employer's.

406
00:34:18,170 --> 00:34:20,412
- Who is that?
- It doesn't matter who he is!

407
00:34:20,464 --> 00:34:23,714
You kill people 'cause they're
on a list? Innocent people?

408
00:34:23,759 --> 00:34:26,511
The man you're working for
is not an economist.

409
00:35:10,722 --> 00:35:12,430
What do you think you're?

410
00:36:06,028 --> 00:36:09,194
Hey, I'm gonna ask you one last time.

411
00:36:09,239 --> 00:36:11,279
Why was Naomi
carrying this picture of me?

412
00:36:11,325 --> 00:36:15,109
You gotta understand something,
she was senior management.

413
00:36:15,162 --> 00:36:16,407
She stayed on her own.

414
00:36:16,455 --> 00:36:18,827
Naomi told me you people
were hired by her.

415
00:36:20,083 --> 00:36:23,168
So you look me right in the eye
and tell me

416
00:36:23,212 --> 00:36:26,248
you've never seen or heard
of Penelope Widmore.

417
00:36:35,516 --> 00:36:37,923
Fine. You don't want to tell me
the truth?

418
00:36:37,976 --> 00:36:39,601
I'll find someone who will.

419
00:36:39,645 --> 00:36:42,136
See, when that takes off, I'm on it.

420
00:36:48,403 --> 00:36:49,946
He's back.

421
00:37:09,341 --> 00:37:12,508
- Where's Kate?
- She decided to stay.

422
00:37:19,643 --> 00:37:21,849
- What happened to Miles?
- I traded him.

423
00:37:21,895 --> 00:37:24,600
- Traded him?
- I promised you Charlotte. Here she is.

424
00:37:27,693 --> 00:37:29,566
- You cheated.
- Did I?

425
00:37:29,611 --> 00:37:31,106
Yes, you did.

426
00:37:31,155 --> 00:37:33,942
Lucky for you that guy's nothing
but a pain in my ass.

427
00:37:36,034 --> 00:37:37,197
- Hey.
- Hey.

428
00:37:37,244 --> 00:37:40,577
All right. That gives us room
for one more.

429
00:37:40,622 --> 00:37:42,117
Charlotte?

430
00:37:42,166 --> 00:37:45,416
Go back? With all the fun
I'm having here? No.

431
00:37:46,378 --> 00:37:47,753
I've got work to do.

432
00:37:48,922 --> 00:37:51,129
Seat's yours if you want it, Daniel.

433
00:37:51,175 --> 00:37:55,219
No, thank you. I think I should
probably stay with Charlotte.

434
00:37:56,638 --> 00:37:57,836
All right.

435
00:37:59,308 --> 00:38:00,588
Frank.

436
00:38:00,642 --> 00:38:01,805
Frank?

437
00:38:01,852 --> 00:38:03,975
Just... just one thing.

438
00:38:06,190 --> 00:38:10,139
Just be sure that you follow
the same exact bearing

439
00:38:10,194 --> 00:38:13,148
that we came in on, OK?
No matter what.

440
00:38:13,197 --> 00:38:17,064
By that I mean no matter what.
Just... stay on it.

441
00:38:18,535 --> 00:38:19,614
Roger that.

442
00:38:29,296 --> 00:38:30,375
Be careful.

443
00:38:30,422 --> 00:38:32,581
I don't have to talk you out of coming.

444
00:38:32,633 --> 00:38:35,883
As much as I like helicopter rides,
you got this one under control.

445
00:38:37,805 --> 00:38:40,378
- Wish me luck.
- Good luck.

446
00:38:42,392 --> 00:38:43,970
Send me a postcard.

447
00:38:47,189 --> 00:38:49,063
You said we have room for one more?

448
00:38:50,150 --> 00:38:51,479
Yeah. Why?

449
00:38:53,695 --> 00:38:55,403
We should bring Naomi home.

450
00:40:36,465 --> 00:40:37,876
Take your shirt off.

451
00:41:00,697 --> 00:41:02,240
Is she dead?

452
00:41:04,201 --> 00:41:05,280
Yes.

453
00:41:07,371 --> 00:41:09,162
Why didn't she kill you?

454
00:41:12,501 --> 00:41:14,790
She was trying to get
information from me.

455
00:41:15,963 --> 00:41:17,338
What sort of information?

456
00:41:23,095 --> 00:41:25,550
She wanted to know who I worked for.

457
00:41:27,141 --> 00:41:29,429
She wanted to know about you.

458
00:41:30,185 --> 00:41:31,644
Of course she did.

459
00:41:35,899 --> 00:41:37,773
Why are you crying?
Because it hurts,

460
00:41:37,818 --> 00:41:40,439
or because you were
stupid enough to care for her?

461
00:41:43,490 --> 00:41:46,277
These people
don't deserve our sympathies.

462
00:41:47,077 --> 00:41:49,912
Need I remind you what they did
the last time you thought

463
00:41:49,955 --> 00:41:52,991
with your heart instead of your gun?

464
00:41:53,041 --> 00:41:55,829
You used that to recruit me
into killing for you.

465
00:41:55,878 --> 00:41:58,713
Do you want to protect
your friends or not, Sayid?

466
00:42:04,470 --> 00:42:06,509
I have another name for you.

467
00:42:11,143 --> 00:42:13,182
But they know I'm after them now.

468
00:42:20,110 --> 00:42:21,818
Good.
