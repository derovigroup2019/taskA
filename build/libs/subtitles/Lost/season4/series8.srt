1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:02,210
Previously on Lost:

2
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:04,925
- We're gonna have to take the boy.
- Dad!

3
00:00:05,025 --> 00:00:08,080
Walt!

4
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:09,395
No!

5
00:00:09,495 --> 00:00:10,890
I'm going after my son.

6
00:00:10,990 --> 00:00:13,020
I'm going after my son,

7
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:15,390
And nobody is gonna stop me.

8
00:00:15,490 --> 00:00:17,410
We need him!

9
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:21,800
One of our people was captured by yours.

10
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:25,200
- So go get'em back.
- We can't do that, but you can.

11
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:28,720
And if you do, we'll let
you and Walt go free.

12
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:31,800
I'll do it. Give me the gun.

13
00:00:33,330 --> 00:00:35,260
I'll kill him.

14
00:00:39,830 --> 00:00:41,070
Michael?

15
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:48,890
You lived up to your word.

16
00:00:50,290 --> 00:00:52,160
We live up to our word, too.

17
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:53,760
You're gonna take this boat

18
00:00:53,860 --> 00:00:55,530
and follow a compass bearing of 3-2-5,

19
00:00:55,630 --> 00:00:57,500
and if you do that exactly,

20
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,510
you and your son will find rescue.

21
00:01:01,610 --> 00:01:03,520
Who are you people?

22
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:07,360
We're the good guys, Michael.

23
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:09,610
- Walt!

24
00:01:09,860 --> 00:01:10,880
- Dad!

25
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:13,270
Come here! Come here!

26
00:02:03,470 --> 00:02:04,830
Thank you all for your patience.

27
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:12,080
I know it's taken me a few days to...

28
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:14,910
figure out our next move,
but I don't want to do anything

29
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:17,020
until I knew more about our situation.

30
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:19,980
You deserve to know everything that I do,

31
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:23,500
so... no more secrets.

32
00:02:25,010 --> 00:02:26,490
As you all know,

33
00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:29,390
Miles here and three of his people

34
00:02:29,490 --> 00:02:32,560
came to the island about a week ago.

35
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:34,700
So I brought him up from the boathouse

36
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:37,300
to share with us

37
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:39,550
exactly why they're here.

38
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:44,960
We're here for him.

39
00:02:46,090 --> 00:02:48,550
Um, we kind of, like,
knew that forever ago.

40
00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:50,530
Well, all right then.

41
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:52,521
Problem solved.
How soon do we turn him over?

42
00:02:52,621 --> 00:02:53,570
We can't turn him over.

43
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:55,084
And why the hell not?

44
00:02:55,134 --> 00:02:56,460
Because once they have me,

45
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:59,310
their orders are to kill
everyone else on the island.

46
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:07,600
Wait. so...what, he's one of us now?

47
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:11,040
You're--you're gonna protect him?
He tried to kill you, John.

48
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:13,910
Yeah. He won't even tell us who
his spy on the boat is.

49
00:03:14,010 --> 00:03:14,770
It's Michael.

50
00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:18,140
What?

51
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:20,810
My spy on the freighter is Michael.

52
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:23,250
I'm sorry.

53
00:03:23,350 --> 00:03:26,980
You mean the same guy that killed
two women in cold blood

54
00:03:27,110 --> 00:03:28,940
to set this little bastard free?

55
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:31,360
And then sold all of us out
so he could get off the island,

56
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:32,505
that Michael?

57
00:03:32,855 --> 00:03:33,710
Yes, James.

58
00:03:37,010 --> 00:03:38,450
That Michael.

59
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,890
The rules of desertion...

60
00:04:05,990 --> 00:04:09,210
still apply to everyone.

61
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:13,550
Nobody leaves this ship
without my say-so!

62
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:19,200
I'm not beating these men to scare you.

63
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,370
I beat them to save your lives!

64
00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:25,310
Do you remember what happened
to the last two men

65
00:04:25,410 --> 00:04:26,880
who took off in this boat?

66
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:29,050
Remember what happened to Minkowski?

67
00:04:29,450 --> 00:04:31,480
As soon as we get the engines fixed,

68
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:33,550
we're back in the hunt.

69
00:04:33,650 --> 00:04:35,620
In the meantime,

70
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:38,470
everybody just hold on.

71
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:41,830
Johnson!

72
00:04:41,930 --> 00:04:43,410
Yes, sir.

73
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:50,670
Clean this mess up.

74
00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:53,250
Sir.

75
00:05:01,330 --> 00:05:02,450
Hello, Michael.

76
00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:05,130
- Not now, man.
- Yes, right now.

77
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:11,990
Why are you on this boat?

78
00:05:12,990 --> 00:05:15,310
I'm here to die.

79
00:05:45,210 --> 00:05:46,210
Hey!

80
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:49,730
That was a nice meetin', John,

81
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:51,850
but I thought there wouldn't gonna
be any more secrets.

82
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:53,710
What are you talking about?

83
00:05:53,850 --> 00:05:54,980
I'm talking about the 3 million bucks

84
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:56,690
your buddy here asked for.

85
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:01,000
Yeah.

86
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:04,640
Miles offered his loyalty
in exchange for the money.

87
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:06,795
But as I haven't seen
a bank on the island,

88
00:06:06,895 --> 00:06:08,300
I didn't think it worth mentioning.

89
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:11,450
Somethin' funny?

90
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,170
Linus will find a way to get it.

91
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:18,490
And how will he do that?

92
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:22,460
He wants to survive.

93
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:26,890
And considering a week ago
you had a gun to his head,

94
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:28,970
and tonight he's eating pound cake...

95
00:06:30,150 --> 00:06:31,960
I'd say he's a guy who gets what he wants.

96
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:40,980
It's fine. Okay, thanks.

97
00:06:42,230 --> 00:06:42,910
Bye, guys.

98
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:45,770
Alex?

99
00:06:48,530 --> 00:06:49,730
May I have a word with you?

100
00:06:50,790 --> 00:06:52,800
I think we've heard enough
from you for one night.

101
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:54,810
I'm sorry. You're just gonna have
to listen to a little more.

102
00:06:54,950 --> 00:06:55,996
It's okay. 

103
00:06:57,446 --> 00:06:58,740
What do you want?

104
00:07:01,290 --> 00:07:03,580
This is a map to the temple.

105
00:07:04,010 --> 00:07:05,060
It's a sanctuary.

106
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:07,570
It may be the last safe
place on this island.

107
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:09,180
How come we don't know about this?

108
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:11,590
Well, it wouldn't be a sanctuary
if I told everyone, would it?

109
00:07:13,610 --> 00:07:14,770
The rest of our people are already there.

110
00:07:14,850 --> 00:07:16,760
If you leave now, you can
get there in a day and a half.

111
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:19,710
If it's safe, why don't we all go--
Hurley, Claire, the baby?

112
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,580
Because the temple's
not for them, Karl.

113
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:22,990
It's only for us.

114
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:26,450
These people that are coming--
they know who I am, Alex.

115
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:27,870
They're here to capture me.

116
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:29,350
They'll kill anybody
that gets in their way.

117
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:32,530
If they knew who you were,
that you were my daughter,

118
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:35,420
they would use you to get to me.

119
00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:37,400
We don't have much time.

120
00:07:40,130 --> 00:07:41,310
Maybe he's right.

121
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:47,360
I agree.

122
00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:48,550
We should go.

123
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:54,310
These people-- you said they're dangerous.

124
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:57,630
More dangerous than you?

125
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:03,390
Yes.

126
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:08,660
But your mother will protect you.

127
00:08:13,210 --> 00:08:14,110
Okay, now go.

128
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:31,870
Where is he?

129
00:08:32,610 --> 00:08:34,250
- You sure?
- Yeah.

130
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:38,210
He's in the engine room.

131
00:08:46,390 --> 00:08:48,200
I don'understand it.
It should be working.

132
00:08:49,450 --> 00:08:50,720
Gaskets are all corroded.

133
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:57,910
Can I help you?

134
00:08:58,040 --> 00:08:59,990
The captain sent us down
to help with the repairs.

135
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:04,780
Oh, thanks. We're okay.

136
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:07,080
Hey, Jeff, man, you know what?

137
00:09:07,270 --> 00:09:09,050
We need a pressure valve.
You mind grabbing one

138
00:09:09,230 --> 00:09:10,865
from the, uh, supply room?

139
00:09:10,915 --> 00:09:11,720
Not at all.

140
00:09:16,850 --> 00:09:18,390
You shouldn't be here.

141
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:20,949
Hey, Sayid, what are you doing?

142
00:09:20,999 --> 00:09:21,540
- Why are you here?
- Listen...

143
00:09:21,730 --> 00:09:22,950
If they see me talking to you--

144
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:23,730
Then talk quickly.

145
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:26,230
- You won't understand it!
- I'll understand perfectly, Michael.

146
00:09:26,830 --> 00:09:28,510
You just start from the beginning

147
00:09:29,190 --> 00:09:31,780
and explain how you came
to be on this boat.

148
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:21,480
I'm sorry.

149
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:21,630
I'm sorry. I didn't mean
to wake you, Mr. Dawson.

150
00:12:22,310 --> 00:12:23,040
It's...

151
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:25,220
What happened to me?

152
00:12:25,450 --> 00:12:28,080
You were in a car accident.
It's a miracle you're alive.

153
00:12:29,170 --> 00:12:30,270
How badly am I hurt?

154
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:32,960
Shh. You just need to rest now.

155
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:35,120
It's a cold night.

156
00:12:35,530 --> 00:12:37,070
I brought you some extra blankets.

157
00:12:49,990 --> 00:12:51,670
Ugh. Let's get some light in here.

158
00:12:53,690 --> 00:12:55,180
Now I thought I heard someone shout,

159
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:57,270
and something tells me it wasn't him.

160
00:12:57,950 --> 00:12:59,100
You okay?

161
00:13:01,130 --> 00:13:02,360
You're lucky to be alive.

162
00:13:03,590 --> 00:13:05,180
EMTs say they found you in a wrecked car.

163
00:13:05,370 --> 00:13:07,100
There's a note pinned to your chest.

164
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:10,800
You didn't have any I.D. on you.

165
00:13:11,890 --> 00:13:13,120
You want to tell me your name?

166
00:13:16,390 --> 00:13:17,620
Yeah, I didn't think so.

167
00:13:19,430 --> 00:13:21,250
You want me to call Walt?

168
00:13:24,150 --> 00:13:25,200
What?

169
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:26,930
The note pinned to your chest.

170
00:13:27,010 --> 00:13:30,010
It was written to 'Walt.'
You want me to call him?

171
00:13:35,050 --> 00:13:35,830
No.

172
00:13:38,230 --> 00:13:39,090
Okay, then.

173
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:05,100
Hey, Ma.

174
00:14:09,330 --> 00:14:11,190
Can I... come in?

175
00:14:11,780 --> 00:14:13,600
No. You know the answer to that.

176
00:14:13,780 --> 00:14:14,380
- I wanna see him.
- No.

177
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:15,826
Just let me talk--

178
00:14:15,876 --> 00:14:17,650
I don't know what you said to that boy,

179
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:20,880
but whatever it was,
he doesn't want to see you.

180
00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:24,150
Please, Ma. He's my son.
I have a right.

181
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:25,510
I thought you were dead.

182
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:29,640
They said your plane crashed
in the middle of the ocean,

183
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,460
but you show up here fine and dandy,

184
00:14:33,270 --> 00:14:36,280
only I can't tell anybody but you or Walt,

185
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:38,230
I can't call you by your real names.

186
00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:40,500
He barely talks to me,

187
00:14:41,270 --> 00:14:44,540
but he does wake up screamin'
in the middle of the night,

188
00:14:45,170 --> 00:14:47,170
and I'm the one that's got to tell him

189
00:14:47,350 --> 00:14:48,530
it's gonna be okay.

190
00:14:52,810 --> 00:14:54,990
So until you can explain to me

191
00:14:55,670 --> 00:14:57,720
where you were for over two months

192
00:14:57,940 --> 00:14:59,260
and what happened...

193
00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:03,260
you gave up your rights.

194
00:15:12,990 --> 00:15:14,170
Will you, uh...

195
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:19,120
Will you tell him I love him?

196
00:15:23,650 --> 00:15:24,610
Yeah.

197
00:16:09,150 --> 00:16:10,340
What can I do for ya?

198
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:13,110
How much can you give me for that?

199
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:18,600
Why is there Chinese writing all over it?

200
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:21,140
It's Korean. And-- the
guy who gave it to me.

201
00:16:21,510 --> 00:16:23,550
You don't look like you speak Korean.

202
00:16:25,370 --> 00:16:27,020
I'll give you $300 for it.

203
00:16:27,070 --> 00:16:28,720
I'm not looking for money.

204
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:31,140
What are you looking for?

205
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:34,050
I want a gun. I want a gun with bullets.

206
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:03,120
Come on. Let's just get this done.

207
00:17:03,630 --> 00:17:05,320
Help me just get this done.

208
00:17:11,670 --> 00:17:13,360
Excuse me, sir. You got the time?

209
00:17:14,310 --> 00:17:15,360
No, man. No.

210
00:17:16,580 --> 00:17:17,990
Come on, Michael.

211
00:17:21,580 --> 00:17:23,580
How about for an old friend?

212
00:17:33,570 --> 00:17:35,300
Manhattan, huh?

213
00:17:36,210 --> 00:17:39,080
We let you leave one island,
you just go to another one.

214
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:44,600
Will you just relax?
I just came here to--

215
00:17:48,390 --> 00:17:50,480
Now are you ready to talk like adults?

216
00:17:51,630 --> 00:17:52,370
Yeah.

217
00:17:58,150 --> 00:17:59,060
Enough!

218
00:18:02,150 --> 00:18:04,650
Do it. Go ahead, do it!

219
00:18:04,890 --> 00:18:06,340
You'd like that, wouldn't you?

220
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:09,620
How do you find me?

221
00:18:10,850 --> 00:18:12,840
We are the ones who
sent you home, Michael.

222
00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:14,930
Did you honestly think we
weren't gonna keep tabs?

223
00:18:16,030 --> 00:18:16,850
What do you want?

224
00:18:17,310 --> 00:18:18,320
Your help.

225
00:18:19,990 --> 00:18:21,490
Why would I help the son of a bitch

226
00:18:21,570 --> 00:18:22,750
who kidnapped my son?

227
00:18:22,990 --> 00:18:24,790
We gave him back to
you in one piece, Mike.

228
00:18:24,930 --> 00:18:26,150
You're the one who lost him.

229
00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:35,260
You told him, didn't you?

230
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:38,940
You couldn't carry the guilt

231
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:41,160
of what you did to those
two women all by yourself,

232
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:42,990
so you shared it with a 10-year-old kid.

233
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:47,490
Is that why you wanna
kill yourself, Michael?

234
00:18:48,350 --> 00:18:49,890
Because that's the way
he looks at you now?

235
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:51,888
Because he knows you're a murderer?

236
00:18:51,938 --> 00:18:52,300
Go away!

237
00:18:52,570 --> 00:18:53,710
I got some bad news for you, amigo.

238
00:18:53,890 --> 00:18:56,210
You can't kill yourself.
The island won't let you!

239
00:18:59,930 --> 00:19:01,150
What'd you say?

240
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:02,970
No matter how bad you want to,

241
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:04,880
no matter how many different ways you try,

242
00:19:05,970 --> 00:19:07,020
It won't happen.

243
00:19:12,730 --> 00:19:14,510
Give it a shot if you don't believe me.

244
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:18,190
You got more work to do, Mike.

245
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:20,730
When you figure that out,

246
00:19:21,330 --> 00:19:23,460
I'm in the penthouse at the Hotel Earle.

247
00:20:04,210 --> 00:20:06,960
The wreckage of Oceanic flight 815

248
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:07,830
has been found.

249
00:20:09,350 --> 00:20:10,570
This footage confirms

250
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:12,890
the airplane did, in fact, crash at sea.

251
00:20:14,740 --> 00:20:15,930
At these tremendous depths,

252
00:20:16,070 --> 00:20:18,290
there is little hope of
recovering any remains.

253
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:20,750
Investigators are equally skeptical

254
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:21,920
about the chances of retrieving

255
00:20:22,110 --> 00:20:24,380
Oceanic 815's black box.

256
00:20:24,810 --> 00:20:26,190
The real story behind

257
00:20:26,370 --> 00:20:28,140
what happened to this fateful airliner

258
00:20:28,410 --> 00:20:32,370
may have been lost along with
the 324 passengers onboard.

259
00:20:33,410 --> 00:20:35,240
But even with this tragic discovery,

260
00:20:35,690 --> 00:20:37,460
the victims' families were hoping today...

261
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:44,460
I didn't expect you that fast.

262
00:20:52,350 --> 00:20:54,110
Is this the guy who hit you
with the champagne bottle?

263
00:20:54,660 --> 00:20:56,430
Yeah, but I had it coming.

264
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:01,520
Arturo, Michael and I have
some business we have to attend to.

265
00:21:02,070 --> 00:21:04,580
- Will you get some air?
- Of course.

266
00:21:05,470 --> 00:21:06,290
Ciao.

267
00:21:10,340 --> 00:21:11,710
Help yourself to the chow.

268
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:14,020
I don't make it to the
mainland too often...

269
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:16,660
So when I do, I like to indulge myself.

270
00:21:17,430 --> 00:21:20,380
So you people can just... come and go?

271
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:22,610
Some of us. You want a drink?

272
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:23,770
What I want is for you to tell me

273
00:21:23,910 --> 00:21:25,820
what my plane is doing at
the bottom of the ocean.

274
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:31,670
That's not your plane. It's a phony.

275
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:35,030
A man named Widmore put it down there,

276
00:21:35,210 --> 00:21:36,890
and he staged the whole wreck.

277
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:39,080
Staged? Why would he stage a--

278
00:21:39,220 --> 00:21:41,060
Because he doesn't want
anyone else finding

279
00:21:41,350 --> 00:21:44,320
where the real plane ended
up... except for him.

280
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:46,770
I'm supposed to believe this?

281
00:21:51,620 --> 00:21:53,710
Did the bullet bounce off your skull,

282
00:21:54,260 --> 00:21:56,890
or did the gun just jam on you?

283
00:22:02,110 --> 00:22:03,060
Prove it.

284
00:22:03,930 --> 00:22:04,670
Sorry?

285
00:22:04,850 --> 00:22:07,030
Prove that this guy, Widmore,
did what you say he did.

286
00:22:07,210 --> 00:22:08,030
Prove it.

287
00:22:20,660 --> 00:22:22,490
That's the cemetery in Thailand

288
00:22:22,670 --> 00:22:25,760
where Widmore dug up the
300-odd corpses he needed.

289
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:28,670
And the purchase order for the old 777

290
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:30,350
bought through a shell company,

291
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:33,080
and the shipping logs
for the freighter he used

292
00:22:33,220 --> 00:22:35,900
to drop the whole mess
down a trench deep enough

293
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:39,080
to guarantee that no remains
are ever gonna be identified.

294
00:22:39,670 --> 00:22:41,010
Do you have any idea what it would cost

295
00:22:41,150 --> 00:22:42,460
to bring those bodies up?

296
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:46,190
What you want from me, man?

297
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:49,820
In a few days,

298
00:22:50,370 --> 00:22:52,360
a freighter is porting in Fiji.

299
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:55,040
It's Widmore's boat.

300
00:22:55,180 --> 00:22:56,160
We have reason to believe
he's finally found

301
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:59,570
the coordinates of the island,
and he's heading right for it.

302
00:23:00,250 --> 00:23:03,060
So congratulations, Michael.
Your shore leave is over.

303
00:23:03,690 --> 00:23:05,280
You just got a job on that boat.

304
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:07,870
Meet Kevin Johnson.

305
00:23:08,870 --> 00:23:11,230
You're joining the crew
in Fiji as a deckhand.

306
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:16,570
You want me to go undercover?

307
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:22,150
Why the hell would I go back
to work for you people?

308
00:23:22,290 --> 00:23:24,600
Because if Widmore finds the island,

309
00:23:24,970 --> 00:23:27,020
it's good night for everybody on it.

310
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:30,190
He'll kill them all
without thinking twice.

311
00:23:31,050 --> 00:23:33,040
You wanna redeem yourself
for what you did?

312
00:23:33,230 --> 00:23:34,770
This is your only chance.

313
00:23:35,370 --> 00:23:36,730
You can save all their lives.

314
00:23:37,660 --> 00:23:40,980
No. I can't. I can't go
back to that island.

315
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:42,980
I didn't say you were
going back to the island.

316
00:23:44,750 --> 00:23:47,610
You're going on that boat so
you can swab decks, Michael.

317
00:23:50,060 --> 00:23:52,600
You're going so you can
kill everyone onboard.

318
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:42,290
Hey.

319
00:24:44,010 --> 00:24:45,740
You are engineer?

320
00:24:47,290 --> 00:24:48,290
Nah.

321
00:24:48,660 --> 00:24:50,020
Just a deckhand.

322
00:24:50,660 --> 00:24:52,300
Well, we're all equals on this boat...

323
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:54,970
as long as you play decent hold'em.

324
00:24:55,750 --> 00:24:57,840
I'm George... Minkowsky.

325
00:24:58,540 --> 00:24:59,640
Kevin Johnson.

326
00:24:59,870 --> 00:25:01,180
Ah, nice to meet you, Kevin.

327
00:25:01,590 --> 00:25:02,495
All right, well, why don't you go check in

328
00:25:02,595 --> 00:25:06,840
with Naomi over there, and, uh,
I'll be seeing you? Welcome.

329
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:16,760
I'm reporting for duty. Kevin Johnson.

330
00:25:20,250 --> 00:25:21,530
Naomi Dorrit. Pleasure.

331
00:25:22,660 --> 00:25:24,020
So you're from the States, yeah?

332
00:25:24,340 --> 00:25:25,170
New York.

333
00:25:25,390 --> 00:25:27,853
Yeah, I could tell from the accent.

334
00:25:27,903 --> 00:25:28,660
Manchester?

335
00:25:29,390 --> 00:25:31,890
How'd you guess? You can head onboard.

336
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:34,660
Oh, uh, one of these crates
was delivered for you.

337
00:25:36,110 --> 00:25:37,570
I'll have it divered to your berth?

338
00:25:39,020 --> 00:25:40,340
Yeah. Thanks.

339
00:25:40,570 --> 00:25:42,080
Welcome aboard, Kevin.

340
00:25:50,410 --> 00:25:51,680
Your name isn't Kevin.

341
00:25:57,670 --> 00:25:58,580
Don't worry.

342
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:02,390
80% of the people on this boat
are lying about something.

343
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:04,130
Orange?

344
00:26:05,670 --> 00:26:06,850
No, thanks.

345
00:26:14,290 --> 00:26:14,689
Yeah?

346
00:26:14,739 --> 00:26:16,240
How was your trip?

347
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:18,610
I figure flying can't be
too much fun for you.

348
00:26:19,660 --> 00:26:20,800
What do you want?

349
00:26:21,070 --> 00:26:22,480
You get your care package?

350
00:26:23,470 --> 00:26:23,863
Yeah.

351
00:26:23,913 --> 00:26:25,810
Wait a day or two until

352
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
you're out in the open sea,
then you're good to go.

353
00:26:28,770 --> 00:26:30,360
You can stow your gear
downstairs, all right?

354
00:26:31,170 --> 00:26:32,490
Welcome aboard, Keamy.

355
00:26:33,490 --> 00:26:35,340
Oh, you met some of 'em now.

356
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:37,160
Got some names and faces,

357
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:38,545
and you're gettin' cold feet, huh?

358
00:26:38,596 --> 00:26:39,710
Yeah, actually, I am.

359
00:26:39,980 --> 00:26:41,710
Well, here are a few more names for ya:

360
00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:44,340
Sun, Sawyer, Jack.
Sun, Sawyer, Jack,

361
00:26:44,530 --> 00:26:45,890
Claire, her baby.

362
00:26:46,250 --> 00:26:47,790
And the only way you're
gonna save their lives

363
00:26:47,930 --> 00:26:50,330
is if you man up and get on that boat.

364
00:26:51,420 --> 00:26:53,920
Or maybe you wanna come back
and explain to your kid

365
00:26:54,100 --> 00:26:56,100
how you let all of them die, too.

366
00:26:57,330 --> 00:26:59,820
It's game time. Are you in or out?

367
00:27:06,130 --> 00:27:07,350
I'm in.

368
00:27:08,940 --> 00:27:11,070
Good. Then ditch your phone
and go do your job.

369
00:27:34,270 --> 00:27:36,270
<i>I am going first,
and that's all there is to it.</i>

370
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:37,760
No offense but I was flying these things

371
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:39,180
when you were still in grade chool.

372
00:27:39,450 --> 00:27:40,916
If anybody's gotta go
first, it should be me.

373
00:27:41,016 --> 00:27:41,640
Yeah, I need you here

374
00:27:41,820 --> 00:27:43,065
to transport the science team, Frank.

375
00:27:43,115 --> 00:27:44,360
What the hell are you gonna be doing?

376
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:46,450
That's need-to-know. You don't.

377
00:27:58,910 --> 00:28:00,680
So much for the fairer sex, huh?

378
00:28:05,090 --> 00:28:07,360
Frank Lapidus, chopper pilot.

379
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:09,110
Kevin Johnson.

380
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:11,390
Deckhand.

381
00:28:14,470 --> 00:28:15,830
So what's your story, Kevin?

382
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:17,290
Sorry?

383
00:28:18,380 --> 00:28:19,750
How'd you end up on this tub?

384
00:28:22,710 --> 00:28:24,360
Looking for a little adventure.

385
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:26,500
Ah, adventure.

386
00:28:27,550 --> 00:28:28,560
Yeah.

387
00:28:29,550 --> 00:28:32,590
Well, how do you like this for adventure?

388
00:28:33,590 --> 00:28:35,770
You ever hear about Oceanic 815?

389
00:28:40,770 --> 00:28:41,780
Yeah.

390
00:28:43,110 --> 00:28:44,560
What would you say if I told you

391
00:28:44,750 --> 00:28:45,520
the plane they found in that trench

392
00:28:45,660 --> 00:28:47,800
wasn't Oceanic 815?

393
00:28:51,370 --> 00:28:52,550
Then what is it?

394
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:56,220
You know those nuts that think
the moon landing was faked?

395
00:28:56,950 --> 00:28:58,180
Well, this is like that...

396
00:28:59,310 --> 00:29:00,400
Only real.

397
00:29:01,630 --> 00:29:03,090
That's why I signed up for this trip,

398
00:29:03,220 --> 00:29:04,900
because the owner of
this boat believes me.

399
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:07,320
- Charles Widmore.
- Charles Widmore.

400
00:29:08,050 --> 00:29:10,460
He believes that 815 is
still out there somewhere.

401
00:29:12,310 --> 00:29:14,350
I mean, can you imagine
what would happen...

402
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:18,570
if we found some of those people alive?

403
00:30:07,830 --> 00:30:08,520
Pull!

404
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:13,970
Pull!

405
00:30:16,710 --> 00:30:17,790
Another clip.

406
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:18,580
<i>Good job.</i>

407
00:30:20,470 --> 00:30:21,520
Pull!

408
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:26,690
Kill shot! Yeah!

409
00:30:28,650 --> 00:30:29,490
What are you guys doing?

410
00:30:32,390 --> 00:30:33,760
What's it look like we're doing?

411
00:30:34,460 --> 00:30:35,910
We're shooting things.

412
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:37,000
Pull!

413
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:42,630
I, uh...

414
00:30:43,450 --> 00:30:44,910
thought we were going
on a rescue mission.

415
00:30:51,470 --> 00:30:53,380
Don't you have something to mop up?

416
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:01,830
Come on. Let's go.

417
00:31:03,010 --> 00:31:04,190
Pull!

418
00:32:11,230 --> 00:32:13,560
You can do this, man. you can do this.

419
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:15,430
7... 1...
7... 1...

420
00:32:16,700 --> 00:32:18,930
7-7-6
7-7-6.

421
00:32:21,870 --> 00:32:22,650
Okay.

422
00:32:39,450 --> 00:32:41,510
Don't do it, Michael.

423
00:33:19,290 --> 00:33:20,620
I love you, Walt.

424
00:33:59,820 --> 00:34:02,820
(Not yet)

425
00:34:20,860 --> 00:34:22,360
What, are you going Nicholson on us?

426
00:34:22,790 --> 00:34:23,331
What?

427
00:34:23,431 --> 00:34:25,130
You know, Jack Nicholson in 'The Shining,'

428
00:34:25,270 --> 00:34:27,540
when he's bouncing that
ball against the wall?

429
00:34:28,680 --> 00:34:29,270
Next thing you know,

430
00:34:29,410 --> 00:34:31,230
you're gonna go after
your wife with an ax.

431
00:34:32,180 --> 00:34:33,360
I'm not married, man.

432
00:34:35,610 --> 00:34:37,350
Well, I'm sorry to interrupt,
but you got a call.

433
00:34:38,580 --> 00:34:39,530
A call?

434
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:41,170
Yeah. from the mainland.

435
00:34:41,300 --> 00:34:42,850
They patched it through to the radio room.

436
00:34:43,630 --> 00:34:45,670
It's gotta be a mistake, man.
Nobody even knows I'm here.

437
00:34:45,810 --> 00:34:47,470
Well, you're the only
Kevin Johnson onboard,

438
00:34:47,610 --> 00:34:49,380
so somebody knows you're here.

439
00:34:49,700 --> 00:34:53,290
Said he really needs to talk to you.
His name's Walt.

440
00:35:01,910 --> 00:35:03,389
Yeah, here you go.

441
00:35:03,439 --> 00:35:04,250
Hey, uh...

442
00:35:04,890 --> 00:35:07,020
It's kind of personal.
Mind if I take this alone?

443
00:35:07,210 --> 00:35:08,390
Take your time, Kev.

444
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:10,890
You just push this yellow button

445
00:35:11,030 --> 00:35:13,840
- and, uh, turn this knob on the console.
- Got it.

446
00:35:13,990 --> 00:35:14,710
Okay.

447
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:21,610
Walt?

448
00:35:22,470 --> 00:35:25,020
I'm so sorry, Michael,
but he's still in New York.

449
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:29,790
So I'm afraid you're stuck with me.

450
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:34,260
Michael?

451
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:37,400
Are you still there?

452
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:41,390
You put me on this boat,

453
00:35:42,620 --> 00:35:44,890
talked me into blowing it up,

454
00:35:45,590 --> 00:35:47,450
and when I push the damn button,

455
00:35:48,270 --> 00:35:49,990
a flag pops up.

456
00:35:51,490 --> 00:35:53,350
You actually activated the bomb?

457
00:35:53,490 --> 00:35:54,450
It's not a bomb! It's a...

458
00:35:55,780 --> 00:35:57,010
It's a joke.

459
00:35:57,870 --> 00:36:00,460
There are people on your boat
who are innocent.

460
00:36:01,550 --> 00:36:02,230
They have no idea

461
00:36:02,370 --> 00:36:04,100
that the man they work for is a monster,

462
00:36:05,230 --> 00:36:07,910
a killer without conscience
or a greater purpose.

463
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:11,410
I had to show you the
difference between him and me.

464
00:36:12,770 --> 00:36:15,460
When I'm at war, I'll do
what I need to do to win,

465
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:17,510
but I will not kill innocent people.

466
00:36:17,970 --> 00:36:19,060
Ana Lucia and Libby...

467
00:36:20,010 --> 00:36:20,960
They were innocent.

468
00:36:21,550 --> 00:36:23,000
You killed them, Michael.

469
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:25,910
No one asked you to.

470
00:36:29,450 --> 00:36:31,090
I don't blame you, Michael.

471
00:36:31,540 --> 00:36:32,820
We did you have your boy.
****

472
00:36:33,730 --> 00:36:36,000
And what wouldn't a man do for his son?

473
00:36:39,350 --> 00:36:42,130
What do you want... from me?

474
00:36:43,890 --> 00:36:45,800
I want you to compile a list of names...

475
00:36:47,210 --> 00:36:48,940
Every person on your boat.

476
00:36:49,710 --> 00:36:52,440
When I call again, you'll
give me that list.

477
00:36:52,950 --> 00:36:53,900
Then you will disable

478
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:55,760
the radio room you're sitting in.

479
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:59,670
When the crew is disoriented
by their lack of communication,

480
00:36:59,850 --> 00:37:01,440
you'll take out the engines, too.

481
00:37:03,210 --> 00:37:05,710
That way, the boat can
never get to this island,

482
00:37:06,050 --> 00:37:07,380
and your friends will be safe.

483
00:37:13,590 --> 00:37:15,450
Will you do that for me, Michael?

484
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:24,210
Yeah.

485
00:37:27,340 --> 00:37:30,240
Then consider yourself
one of the good guys.

486
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:58,710
So you're telling me...

487
00:38:01,070 --> 00:38:03,210
that you're working for Benjamin Linus?

488
00:38:10,070 --> 00:38:11,160
Yeah.

489
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:15,680
Yeah, that's what I'm telling you.

490
00:38:25,390 --> 00:38:26,250
Hey, Sayid.

491
00:38:26,430 --> 00:38:27,070
Guys!

492
00:38:27,620 --> 00:38:28,810
Hold it! Uhh!

493
00:38:28,990 --> 00:38:30,560
Let me go! What are you doing?!

494
00:38:30,750 --> 00:38:31,650
Shut your mouth.

495
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:36,840
What the hell is this?

496
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:39,590
This man is not who you think he is.

497
00:38:39,820 --> 00:38:42,410
He was a passenger on
Oceanic flight 815.

498
00:38:42,690 --> 00:38:44,590
I spent two months with him on the island

499
00:38:45,090 --> 00:38:46,780
before he betrayed us.

500
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:49,190
This is the man who
sabotaged your radio room.

501
00:38:49,380 --> 00:38:51,100
He destroyed the ship's engine,

502
00:38:51,470 --> 00:38:53,510
and his name isn't Kevin Johnson.

503
00:38:55,010 --> 00:38:56,230
It's Michael Dawson,

504
00:38:58,140 --> 00:38:59,640
and he's a traitor.

505
00:39:18,790 --> 00:39:20,690
Let's stop here and drink.

506
00:39:21,100 --> 00:39:23,190
Two minutes, then we keep moving.

507
00:39:43,290 --> 00:39:44,110
What's wrong?

508
00:39:45,510 --> 00:39:46,510
Nothing.

509
00:39:47,380 --> 00:39:48,280
Karl.

510
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:50,470
I don't know.

511
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:54,190
I just have a bad feeling about this.

512
00:39:55,100 --> 00:39:58,000
What if your dad is... playing us?

513
00:39:59,060 --> 00:40:01,690
Look, I don't like taking
orders from my dad

514
00:40:01,830 --> 00:40:03,190
any more than you do.

515
00:40:04,140 --> 00:40:06,370
But I know he doesn't want me to get hurt.

516
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:10,230
Well, at least we've
got something in common.

517
00:40:12,420 --> 00:40:14,230
I promise not to tell if you won't.

518
00:40:24,330 --> 00:40:25,580
Alex!

519
00:40:25,630 --> 00:40:26,880
Karl...

520
00:40:29,870 --> 00:40:30,504
Karl, Karl! No!

521
00:40:31,190 --> 00:40:33,190
Come on. Come on.
He's gone.

522
00:40:33,830 --> 00:40:34,460
Duck!

523
00:40:35,670 --> 00:40:36,400
Duck!

524
00:40:38,490 --> 00:40:39,644
No, no, we have to get Karl.

525
00:40:39,694 --> 00:40:40,890
- He is gone. He's gone!
- No...

526
00:40:41,190 --> 00:40:44,920
He's gone! Listen to me.
I need you to take my hand.

527
00:40:45,100 --> 00:40:47,670
On the count of three, we're going to run.

528
00:40:47,990 --> 00:40:50,500
Can you do that with me?

529
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:53,560
I love you.

530
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:56,330
I love you very much, Alexandra.

531
00:40:58,950 --> 00:41:00,460
Are you ready?

532
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:02,230
One...

533
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:04,780
Two...

534
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,360
Three!

535
00:41:38,010 --> 00:41:40,950
Wait! Wait! Don't! I'm Ben's daughter!

536
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:43,270
I'm his daughter!
