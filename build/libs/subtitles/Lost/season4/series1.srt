1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:02,060
Previously on "Lost"...

2
00:00:02,370 --> 00:00:03,620
Can you hear me?

3
00:00:03,670 --> 00:00:05,960
Yes! Yes, I can hear you.

4
00:00:06,010 --> 00:00:07,290
Hey, are you on a boat?

5
00:00:07,330 --> 00:00:08,830
- What--what boat?
- Your boat.

6
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:10,350
I'm not on a boat.

7
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:12,800
Uh, na-Naomi, the parachutist.

8
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:14,340
Who? Who's Naomi?

9
00:00:14,390 --> 00:00:15,940
I've got it. I've got a signal!

10
00:00:15,986 --> 00:00:18,990
It's gonna work. It's happening.
We're gonna get off of this island.

11
00:00:23,511 --> 00:00:25,308
Hello? Is Desmond there?

12
00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:28,749
Penny! No!

13
00:00:31,625 --> 00:00:35,287
I'm telling you, making that call
is the beginning of the end.

14
00:00:35,299 --> 00:00:37,973
Who is this? Who is this?

15
00:00:39,538 --> 00:00:42,992
I'm one of the survivors
of oceanic flight 815.

16
00:00:44,447 --> 00:00:46,383
Can you get a fix
on our location?

17
00:00:46,426 --> 00:00:48,122
Sit tight.

18
00:00:48,186 --> 00:00:50,313
We'll be right there.

19
00:01:17,847 --> 00:01:21,732
It's almost 30 minutes now since
the start of this high-speed chase.

20
00:01:22,197 --> 00:01:25,593
We still have no information
about who's driving this vehicle.

21
00:01:25,998 --> 00:01:28,702
Jeff, can you tell us
where the chase started?

22
00:01:28,768 --> 00:01:32,090
Ruth, we're hearing reports that the
pursuit began near the la brea area,

23
00:01:32,145 --> 00:01:35,603
then traveled through a warehousing
district south of the 10 freeway.

24
00:01:35,965 --> 00:01:38,440
Can you see how many
people are in the car?

25
00:01:38,507 --> 00:01:40,682
It appears to be just the one--
the driver.

26
00:01:40,736 --> 00:01:42,971
We're not sure if that's
the owner of the car.

27
00:01:43,257 --> 00:01:47,422
What you're seeing here are pictures
of the 10 freeway south of downtown.

28
00:01:47,467 --> 00:01:48,971
Is that a camaro, jeff?

29
00:01:49,027 --> 00:01:52,402
Yes, it looks like a-a vintage,
early '70s model.

30
00:01:52,446 --> 00:01:53,920
Damn it.

31
00:02:13,776 --> 00:02:15,392
Show us your hands!

32
00:02:22,258 --> 00:02:25,101
Roll down the window and
show us your hands now!

33
00:02:34,755 --> 00:02:37,653
Now slowly open the door
with your left hand.

34
00:02:44,925 --> 00:02:46,890
Get out of the car!

35
00:02:47,315 --> 00:02:49,652
Turnround... Slow!

36
00:03:04,028 --> 00:03:05,980
On the ground!

37
00:03:06,545 --> 00:03:08,310
Now!

38
00:03:14,295 --> 00:03:16,223
Stop! Dot you know who I am?

39
00:03:16,286 --> 00:03:18,131
Stop! Wait!
don't you know who I am?

40
00:03:18,195 --> 00:03:20,603
I'm one of the oceanic six!

41
00:03:21,028 --> 00:03:23,782
I'one of the oceanic six!

45
00:03:39,886 --> 00:03:44,660
... ... Across the city,

46
00:03:44,707 --> 00:03:48,270
you're minding your own business
in a convenience store,

47
00:03:48,708 --> 00:03:52,271
until you see something
and freak out.

48
00:03:52,598 --> 00:03:55,160
Mr. Reyes,
why'd you run like that?

49
00:03:55,175 --> 00:03:57,001
Who'd you see in there?

50
00:03:58,018 --> 00:04:00,101
Listen, buddy,
I know you saw somebody in that store

51
00:04:00,138 --> 00:04:02,741
that made you run away
and go on a high-speed--

52
00:04:02,775 --> 00:04:05,152
I wasn't running
away from anyone.

53
00:04:05,216 --> 00:04:10,863
If you think I care that you're a
celebrity, you crashed your camaro in
the wrong neighborhood.

54
00:04:10,898 --> 00:04:12,862
I'm not a celebrity.

55
00:04:13,818 --> 00:04:17,463
Is that why you kept shouting,
"hey, I'm one of the oceanic six"?

56
00:04:19,096 --> 00:04:21,491
You wanna know a
funny coincidence?

57
00:04:21,915 --> 00:04:23,500
Sure.

58
00:04:23,977 --> 00:04:26,363
I knew somebody your plane.

59
00:04:27,257 --> 00:04:29,030
Really?

60
00:04:30,086 --> 00:04:33,041
Her name was ana lucia cortez.

61
00:04:33,425 --> 00:04:36,200
She was my partner before
I made detective--

62
00:04:36,838 --> 00:04:41,432
dark hair... Gorgeous.

63
00:04:43,705 --> 00:04:45,861
Maybe you knew her.

64
00:04:48,078 --> 00:04:50,483
Maybe you met her
on the plane...

65
00:04:50,535 --> 00:04:52,793
Before it took off?

66
00:04:53,896 --> 00:04:55,802
Sorry. Never met her.

67
00:05:01,606 --> 00:05:04,022
Why don't you watch the tape?

68
00:05:04,845 --> 00:05:07,231
Maybe it'll spark something.

69
00:05:08,158 --> 00:05:09,791
I'm gonna get a doughnut.

70
00:05:09,847 --> 00:05:11,553
You want one?

71
00:05:12,196 --> 00:05:13,191
No, thanks.

72
00:05:13,228 --> 00:05:17,040
And when I come back,
you're gonna tell me who you ran from.

73
00:05:48,255 --> 00:05:50,791
Help! Help!

74
00:05:52,925 --> 00:05:54,652
Help!

75
00:05:55,677 --> 00:05:57,153
Let me out!

76
00:05:57,668 --> 00:06:00,012
What the hell is
wrong with you?

77
00:06:00,677 --> 00:06:02,580
What are you doing, reyes? Huh?

78
00:06:02,627 --> 00:06:04,722
You trying to get tossed
into the nuthouse?

79
00:06:04,777 --> 00:06:08,273
Because if that's what you want, I can
make that happen right now, my friend.

80
00:06:08,766 --> 00:06:10,452
You can?

81
00:06:10,506 --> 00:06:12,420
Oh, thank you!

82
00:06:12,468 --> 00:06:15,330
Thank you.

83
00:06:16,688 --> 00:06:18,901
Jack? You there, dude?

84
00:06:18,966 --> 00:06:21,120
Beach to Jack, come in, Jack.

85
00:06:21,356 --> 00:06:22,962
Beach to Jack.

86
00:06:23,058 --> 00:06:24,582
Right here, Hurley. What's up?

87
00:06:24,638 --> 00:06:28,082
Hey, uh, did you guys make it
to that radio tower thingy yet?

88
00:06:28,116 --> 00:06:30,323
Yeah, and I talked to
the people on the boat.

89
00:06:30,366 --> 00:06:32,522
They're on their way to
pick us up right now.

90
00:06:32,858 --> 00:06:34,960
Seriously? It worked?

91
00:06:35,018 --> 00:06:38,440
Seriously. We're all on the way
back to the beach right now,

92
00:06:38,486 --> 00:06:40,772
so you better pack
your bags, buddy.

93
00:06:42,675 --> 00:06:44,782
Dude, that's great!

94
00:06:51,946 --> 00:06:53,090
Any luck?

95
00:06:53,165 --> 00:06:54,883
Nothing. No sign of him.

96
00:06:54,936 --> 00:06:57,223
It's like he just disappeared.

97
00:06:58,028 --> 00:06:59,512
Why would Locke kill her?

98
00:06:59,568 --> 00:07:01,873
-He hadn't even met her-
- because he's crazy.

99
00:07:02,348 --> 00:07:04,682
So what if he comes back?

100
00:07:04,736 --> 00:07:07,011
If he comes back,
I'm gonna kill him.

101
00:07:12,408 --> 00:07:14,070
I'm gonna get
everybod together.

102
00:07:14,136 --> 00:07:16,513
The sooner we get back to the beach,
the better.

103
00:07:19,818 --> 00:07:22,331
Are we really going home?

104
00:07:23,627 --> 00:07:26,493
Yeah, we're really going home.

105
00:07:34,435 --> 00:07:38,640
I can't believe I'm actually going
to have my baby in a hospital.

106
00:07:38,718 --> 00:07:41,322
-Oh, rub it in, why don't you?
-Oh, no.

107
00:07:41,377 --> 00:07:43,100
You ladies need a hand?

108
00:07:43,167 --> 00:07:45,751
No, we're just wrapping
things up, thanks.

109
00:07:47,068 --> 00:07:49,151
You know,
you must be very proud of bernard.

110
00:07:49,206 --> 00:07:51,410
I hear he's quite the hero.

111
00:07:51,496 --> 00:07:55,230
Look, everyone up here knows that
the real hero is your man, claire.

112
00:07:55,275 --> 00:07:57,393
If Charlie didn't
turn off that gizmo,

113
00:07:57,436 --> 00:08:01,500
we'd still be getting a busy
signal on that fancy phon

114
00:08:02,077 --> 00:08:06,841
so you better make sure you treat
him real good when we get back.

115
00:08:07,255 --> 00:08:09,130
Rose!

116
00:08:11,848 --> 00:08:13,620
Okay, thanks. I have enough.

117
00:08:13,678 --> 00:08:16,203
I need you to do me a favor.

118
00:08:18,277 --> 00:08:22,563
I need you to take alex and get
as far from here as possible.

119
00:08:22,767 --> 00:08:25,582
-What?
-We don't have time for this.

120
00:08:25,616 --> 00:08:28,770
Everyone who stays
here is going to die.

121
00:08:29,608 --> 00:08:31,811
Now get alex and
get away right now.

122
00:08:31,878 --> 00:08:34,363
I don't care where you gO.
Just go.

123
00:08:34,428 --> 00:08:36,393
I will not have my daughter--

124
00:08:39,295 --> 00:08:41,883
she's not your daughter.

125
00:08:59,738 --> 00:09:02,062
Did I ever tell you
I won the lottery?

126
00:09:03,888 --> 00:09:07,070
I got, like, $150 million.

127
00:09:07,317 --> 00:09:08,950
Worst thing that
ever happened to me.

128
00:09:09,017 --> 00:09:11,243
Oh, yeah,
who needs $150 million, right?

129
00:09:11,298 --> 00:09:15,403
Now it'll all be gone,
'cause they all think I'm dead.

130
00:09:15,728 --> 00:09:18,853
When we get rescued,
and I go back...

131
00:09:19,768 --> 00:09:22,320
I'm gonna be free.

132
00:09:26,656 --> 00:09:29,070
I wanna do a cannonball.

133
00:09:29,798 --> 00:09:34,960
I've been walking up and down this
beach every day and looking out at 

134
00:09:35,007 --> 00:09:38,330
this water,
and I wanna do a cannonball.

135
00:09:38,398 --> 00:09:39,621
Hurley...

136
00:09:39,656 --> 00:09:43,872
You wanna do a
cannonball, cannonball.

137
00:10:24,618 --> 00:10:26,360
Are you all right, Desmond?

138
00:10:28,487 --> 00:10:29,743
We need to get to Jack.

139
00:10:29,785 --> 00:10:31,582
We can't let him get in
touch with that boat.

140
00:10:31,616 --> 00:10:34,381
Easy, Scotty. Everything's cool.
Boat's on the way.

141
00:10:34,415 --> 00:10:36,050
-What?
-On the way?

142
00:10:36,095 --> 00:10:37,233
No. Hey, where's Charlie?

143
00:10:37,266 --> 00:10:38,600
No, that woman-- Naomi--
she lied.

144
00:10:38,631 --> 00:10:40,948
Look, the people on the boat
aren't who they say they are!

145
00:10:40,970 --> 00:10:42,619
-What?
-Then who are they?

146
00:10:42,655 --> 00:10:45,987
-Desmond, where's Charlie?
-I don't know. But we need to get
in touch with Jack now!

147
00:10:46,019 --> 00:10:47,842
We can call him.
We have a walkie.

148
00:10:47,856 --> 00:10:48,841
-Where is it?
-Get it.

149
00:10:48,875 --> 00:10:51,820
-What do you mean the people aren't
who they say- - where's Charlie?

150
00:10:57,727 --> 00:11:00,600
I'm--I'm--I'm sorry,
brother. I...

151
00:11:25,138 --> 00:11:27,100
You think that's our ride?

152
00:11:28,626 --> 00:11:29,532
Hello?

153
00:11:29,586 --> 00:11:31,562
Hey, Jack.
This is george minkowski.

154
00:11:31,596 --> 00:11:35,502
We're trying to get a lock on your
signal there, but we're getting some
rf interference.

155
00:11:35,557 --> 00:11:38,771
We're gonna need to rejigger some
of the settings on your sat-phone.

156
00:11:38,837 --> 00:11:41,023
Uh, sure. Okay.
Just tell me what I gotta do.

157
00:11:41,055 --> 00:11:43,201
How about you put Naomi on?

158
00:11:44,025 --> 00:11:46,812
Naomi went to get
some firewood.

159
00:11:46,855 --> 00:11:49,122
Can you hold on for a second?
Let me see if I can...

160
00:12:03,636 --> 00:12:05,570
Where is she?

161
00:12:07,697 --> 00:12:09,543
I don't know.

162
00:12:13,647 --> 00:12:15,650
We gotta call the doc.

163
00:12:15,848 --> 00:12:17,293
Did you listen to Desmond?

164
00:12:17,307 --> 00:12:20,403
- Charlie wrote on his hand-
- Look, I'm sorry he's dead,

165
00:12:20,445 --> 00:12:22,863
but I don't even know what the
hell "not penny's boat" means.

166
00:12:22,897 --> 00:12:24,351
Calling Jack
accomplishes nothing.

167
00:12:24,405 --> 00:12:25,770
It would accomplish
warning him...

168
00:12:25,816 --> 00:12:28,980
It also means warning the people on the
freighter that we're suspicious of them.

169
00:12:29,037 --> 00:12:31,222
I have no doubt they're
monitoring our communications.

170
00:12:31,256 --> 00:12:33,912
-If we call Jack-
-You know what? I got the walkie.

171
00:12:33,957 --> 00:12:35,660
I'm making the call.

172
00:12:41,266 --> 00:12:43,123
We better get goin'.

173
00:12:47,385 --> 00:12:49,111
Going where?

174
00:12:55,035 --> 00:12:57,150
I found blood--the
girl's trail.

175
00:12:57,197 --> 00:12:58,461
Probably crawled away.

176
00:12:58,497 --> 00:13:00,261
Can't be more than ten
minutes ahead of us.

177
00:13:00,308 --> 00:13:02,992
We should go now and find her.

178
00:13:03,025 --> 00:13:04,982
We're taking him with us.

179
00:13:05,025 --> 00:13:06,150
And why would we do that?

180
00:13:06,187 --> 00:13:08,803
Because I don't trust
him with anybody but me.

181
00:13:12,215 --> 00:13:13,833
All right, listen up.

182
00:13:13,898 --> 00:13:17,313
I need all of you to head back down to
the beach, and when these people
show up,

183
00:13:17,365 --> 00:13:21,381
we wanna make sure that we're
real easy for them to find, okay?

184
00:13:21,436 --> 00:13:23,683
You look worried, Jack.

185
00:13:25,556 --> 00:13:28,270
The only thing I'm worried
about is missing our ride home.

186
00:13:33,788 --> 00:13:35,210
I found her trail.

187
00:13:35,288 --> 00:13:37,553
She's headed west
across the island.

188
00:13:37,598 --> 00:13:38,782
Rousseau already found it.

189
00:13:38,836 --> 00:13:40,813
We're going after
her right now.

190
00:13:41,815 --> 00:13:45,072
What? Are you sure it's hers?

191
00:13:45,128 --> 00:13:47,270
Unless someone
else is bleeding.

192
00:13:47,316 --> 00:13:50,730
But if she didn't want us to find her,
then she could've created a dummy trail

193
00:13:50,768 --> 00:13:52,052
I think we should follow both--

194
00:13:52,085 --> 00:13:56,922
Kate, 6 hours from now, we'll be
sitting on that boat laughing about the

195
00:13:56,977 --> 00:14:00,450
fact that there was one final
thing that we couldn't agree upon.

196
00:14:00,498 --> 00:14:01,741
Naomi is hurt.

197
00:14:01,788 --> 00:14:05,121
She ran into the jungle. She's not
thinking about leaving fake trails.

198
00:14:06,697 --> 00:14:07,630
You're right.

199
00:14:07,677 --> 00:14:08,771
I'll track her down.

200
00:14:08,817 --> 00:14:11,052
Why don't you get everybody
back to the beach?

201
00:14:11,096 --> 00:14:12,930
You got it.

202
00:14:21,175 --> 00:14:23,092
Be careful, okay?

203
00:14:35,828 --> 00:14:37,801
What the hell's gotten
into you, hugo?

204
00:14:37,825 --> 00:14:39,962
They'll all be back in the morning.
If we just wait--

205
00:14:39,996 --> 00:14:42,910
you don't wait with warnings.
You... warn.

206
00:14:55,828 --> 00:14:58,481
Here I was thinking I was
gonna get a good night's sleep.

207
00:15:08,758 --> 00:15:10,710
You almost got me that time.

208
00:15:10,887 --> 00:15:13,571
How about best out of seven?

209
00:15:14,005 --> 00:15:16,521
Are you ready for
your meds, hugo?

210
00:15:17,666 --> 00:15:20,363
Oh, by the way,
you have a visitor.

211
00:15:30,755 --> 00:15:32,590
Mr. Reyes.

212
00:15:32,958 --> 00:15:36,362
Hello. My name is
matthew abbadon.

213
00:15:36,805 --> 00:15:39,600
I'm an attorney for
oceanic airlines.

214
00:15:40,116 --> 00:15:42,563
Can we talk for a few minutes?

215
00:15:44,195 --> 00:15:45,913
Okay.

216
00:15:50,155 --> 00:15:53,931
I'm here, Mr. Reyes,
because we've heard about your recent...

217
00:15:53,988 --> 00:15:55,740
Episode.

218
00:15:55,776 --> 00:15:59,163
Your arrest,
your incarceration here--

219
00:15:59,927 --> 00:16:02,863
frankly, we feel
terrible about it.

220
00:16:03,527 --> 00:16:09,101
So on behalf of oceanic, I'd like to
extend you an invitation for a
little upgrade.

221
00:16:10,575 --> 00:16:13,033
What... Kind of upgrade?

222
00:16:14,716 --> 00:16:18,230
To a facility where the paint
isn't peeling off the walls,

223
00:16:18,695 --> 00:16:21,001
where you'd have
your own bathroom.

224
00:16:21,048 --> 00:16:24,083
-You can see the ocean from-
- I don't wanna see the ocean.

225
00:16:25,728 --> 00:16:27,550
No problem.

226
00:16:29,915 --> 00:16:31,011
Actually, thanks.

227
00:16:31,066 --> 00:16:34,200
I'M... I'm fine right here.

228
00:16:35,217 --> 00:16:38,470
Are you fine, Mr. Reyes?

229
00:16:38,845 --> 00:16:40,571
What do you mean?

230
00:16:40,628 --> 00:16:43,300
You're in a mental institution.

231
00:16:44,296 --> 00:16:46,971
Who'd you say you were again?

232
00:16:47,135 --> 00:16:50,220
I'd like to see
a business card.

233
00:16:54,735 --> 00:16:57,073
I must have left them at home.

234
00:16:58,847 --> 00:17:01,013
Then we're done, dude.

235
00:17:02,136 --> 00:17:04,652
Are they still alive?

236
00:17:07,198 --> 00:17:09,243
What?

237
00:17:09,735 --> 00:17:11,953
You heard me.

238
00:17:12,077 --> 00:17:14,040
Nurse!

239
00:17:14,088 --> 00:17:15,120
Get out of here!

240
00:17:15,155 --> 00:17:16,192
You better get outta here!

241
00:17:16,225 --> 00:17:17,903
Help me! He's after me.

242
00:17:17,945 --> 00:17:20,010
No, no, no, no.
That guy's after me! Help me!

243
00:17:39,758 --> 00:17:41,442
You all right there, hugo?

244
00:17:41,477 --> 00:17:43,032
Yeah, dude, I'm fine.

245
00:17:44,508 --> 00:17:46,032
You wanna talk about it?

246
00:17:46,077 --> 00:17:47,441
Talk about what?

247
00:17:47,478 --> 00:17:49,361
Charlie.

248
00:17:53,726 --> 00:17:55,350
I mean...

249
00:17:55,397 --> 00:17:57,821
You two were buddies.
I just thought...

250
00:17:59,065 --> 00:18:02,370
We'll probably get to Jack
faster if we don't talk.

251
00:18:09,228 --> 00:18:11,652
I'm gonna head up and tell
them to slow down a little.

252
00:18:11,695 --> 00:18:12,641
I can keep up.

253
00:18:12,687 --> 00:18:14,303
All right, ese.

254
00:18:14,345 --> 00:18:17,873
Just... Holler if you need me.

255
00:18:49,058 --> 00:18:50,661
Guys?

256
00:18:51,048 --> 00:18:55,172
Guys! Guys!

257
00:18:59,726 --> 00:19:02,343
Guys! Guys!

258
00:19:33,206 --> 00:19:35,211
The blood trail ends here.

259
00:19:35,598 --> 00:19:37,670
What do you mean?

260
00:19:37,746 --> 00:19:38,962
It ends.

261
00:19:39,005 --> 00:19:41,470
What, are you telling me that
she stopped bleeding here?

262
00:19:41,517 --> 00:19:45,063
No, I'm telling you that she
fooled us and doubled back.

263
00:19:45,107 --> 00:19:49,790
Better call the boat, ll 'em she's
getting a really big bundle of firewood

264
00:19:58,307 --> 00:19:59,400
where is it?

265
00:19:59,446 --> 00:20:03,972
Okay, I probably should have told you
that I saw her take the phone, but you
beat me up, Jack.

266
00:20:04,726 --> 00:20:06,131
I owed you one.

267
00:20:06,175 --> 00:20:07,591
What are you talking about?

268
00:20:07,638 --> 00:20:10,472
Kate took it when
she hugged you.

269
00:20:12,106 --> 00:20:14,730
She found thright trail, too,
but you wouldn't listen to her,

270
00:20:14,766 --> 00:20:17,541
so I guess she's taken
matters into her own hands.

271
00:20:17,595 --> 00:20:21,681
But look on the bright sid at least
somebody around here knows what the hell
they're doing.

272
00:21:01,208 --> 00:21:02,002
Hello?

273
00:21:02,015 --> 00:21:03,313
Who's this?

274
00:21:04,997 --> 00:21:06,233
Uh, this is Kate.

275
00:21:06,246 --> 00:21:07,542
You with Jack?

276
00:21:07,557 --> 00:21:09,113
No, no, he's not here.

277
00:21:09,126 --> 00:21:10,783
Where's Naomi?

278
00:21:12,747 --> 00:21:14,293
Uh, we're looking for her.

279
00:21:14,307 --> 00:21:17,280
What do you mean,
you're looking for her?

280
00:21:28,725 --> 00:21:30,430
Give me the phone.

281
00:21:32,338 --> 00:21:33,761
Give me the phone.

282
00:21:33,776 --> 00:21:35,532
Naomi, listen to me.

283
00:21:35,546 --> 00:21:36,792
You're hurt. Let me help you.

284
00:21:36,806 --> 00:21:37,883
Help me?

285
00:21:38,535 --> 00:21:42,051
I just spent the last three days
trying to get you people rescued,

286
00:21:42,395 --> 00:21:44,651
and you throw this
knifen my back.

287
00:21:44,668 --> 00:21:47,383
- No, that was not us.
- Who?

288
00:21:47,395 --> 00:21:49,770
- His name is John Locke.
- What?

289
00:21:49,785 --> 00:21:52,340
He said that you weren't
who you said you were.

290
00:21:54,457 --> 00:21:57,890
I swear to god we would never hurt you.
You know us.

291
00:21:58,495 --> 00:22:01,192
Please, we need your help.
Please help us.

292
00:22:01,205 --> 00:22:03,380
Give me the phone.

293
00:22:08,628 --> 00:22:10,982
George, it's Naomi.

294
00:22:10,998 --> 00:22:12,601
Naomi, where have you been?

295
00:22:12,617 --> 00:22:15,251
What's going on over there?

296
00:22:17,145 --> 00:22:19,152
I had an accident.

297
00:22:19,685 --> 00:22:20,622
I'm hurt.

298
00:22:20,636 --> 00:22:21,853
What? A-an accident?

299
00:22:21,866 --> 00:22:24,783
What--what--what accident?
What happened?

300
00:22:25,588 --> 00:22:27,422
Naomi!

301
00:22:27,438 --> 00:22:29,120
Hello?

302
00:22:29,135 --> 00:22:30,443
Hello?

303
00:22:30,455 --> 00:22:34,760
I hit a tree branch
when I parachuted in.

304
00:22:34,775 --> 00:22:36,473
Took it through my gut.

305
00:22:36,485 --> 00:22:38,681
Why did they tell me you
were getting firewood?

306
00:22:38,697 --> 00:22:42,633
I guess they were afraid to tell you
what happened to me till I could talk to
you myself.

307
00:22:42,647 --> 00:22:45,503
We've lost our signal,
and can't come get you.

308
00:22:45,516 --> 00:22:47,682
Can you change your
tracking frequency?

309
00:22:47,697 --> 00:22:49,330
Yeah.

310
00:22:52,887 --> 00:22:54,892
Try it now.

311
00:22:54,905 --> 00:22:56,511
Clear as a bell.

312
00:22:56,527 --> 00:23:00,711
Hang on, Naomi. We'll--we'll
get you back here asap, okay?

313
00:23:00,725 --> 00:23:03,141
I'm sorry, george.

314
00:23:04,676 --> 00:23:07,922
Just tell my sister
that I love her.

315
00:23:16,486 --> 00:23:18,633
Hello?

316
00:24:01,597 --> 00:24:03,211
Help!

317
00:24:03,825 --> 00:24:05,381
Help!

318
00:24:05,397 --> 00:24:07,111
Help!

319
00:24:22,106 --> 00:24:25,571
There's nothing here.
There's nothing here.

320
00:24:25,588 --> 00:24:29,563
There's nothing here.
There's nothing here.

321
00:24:41,898 --> 00:24:43,581
Hello, hugo.

322
00:24:45,675 --> 00:24:48,842
You got yourself good
and lost out here, hugo.

323
00:24:50,516 --> 00:24:53,463
How did you get
separated from the group?

324
00:24:56,397 --> 00:24:58,240
I just...

325
00:24:59,307 --> 00:25:01,241
Fell behind, I guess.

326
00:25:01,256 --> 00:25:03,862
Is that why you were
shouting for help?

327
00:25:03,895 --> 00:25:06,021
Well, I got scared.

328
00:25:09,167 --> 00:25:15,003
What Desmond said happened down in
that station-- "not penny's boat"...

329
00:25:15,687 --> 00:25:19,093
Are you sure that's what
Charlie wrote on his hand?

330
00:25:19,105 --> 00:25:21,062
Jack should never have
called those people.

331
00:25:21,078 --> 00:25:23,621
I couldn't agree more.

332
00:25:24,536 --> 00:25:26,912
It's gonna be hard to...

333
00:25:26,925 --> 00:25:30,162
Talk him into thinking they're
not coming here to rescue us.

334
00:25:30,177 --> 00:25:33,851
Well, we're just gonna have
to try our best, hugo,

335
00:25:33,865 --> 00:25:37,782
because if we can't
talk him out of it...

336
00:25:38,935 --> 00:25:41,962
Then Charlie died for nothing.

337
00:25:56,587 --> 00:25:58,370
Where the hell you been, hugo?

338
00:25:58,386 --> 00:25:59,560
Sorry.

339
00:25:59,576 --> 00:26:03,270
I was just, uh, I got lost.

340
00:26:08,807 --> 00:26:11,553
What are you doing here?

341
00:26:11,566 --> 00:26:16,220
I came here for the same reason you
did--to warn Jack about the people on
that boat.

342
00:26:16,235 --> 00:26:21,903
I already gave it a shot, but I figured
I might have better luck with
some support.

343
00:26:21,917 --> 00:26:23,511
You want my support?

344
00:26:23,526 --> 00:26:26,212
You can tell me why you
destroyed that submarine.

345
00:27:02,968 --> 00:27:04,773
Still in one piece.

346
00:27:04,786 --> 00:27:06,243
Rambo.

347
00:27:19,366 --> 00:27:21,242
I'll tell her.

348
00:27:44,736 --> 00:27:46,681
He's dead.

349
00:27:49,657 --> 00:27:52,322
Charlie'S... dead.

350
00:27:52,835 --> 00:27:54,400
No.

351
00:28:17,007 --> 00:28:18,972
I'd watch out if I were you.

352
00:28:20,286 --> 00:28:21,811
What are you
talking about, dude?

353
00:28:21,826 --> 00:28:23,580
There's a guy over there.

354
00:28:23,595 --> 00:28:25,401
He's staring at you.

355
00:28:25,416 --> 00:28:26,800
What guy?

356
00:28:26,818 --> 00:28:28,611
That guy.

357
00:28:31,207 --> 00:28:32,850
Hey, man.

358
00:28:33,407 --> 00:28:35,613
Don't run.

359
00:28:36,516 --> 00:28:40,581
Hurley. Just... just...

360
00:28:41,307 --> 00:28:43,263
Sit down.

361
00:28:43,888 --> 00:28:46,480
I wanna talk to you.

362
00:28:48,507 --> 00:28:50,120
Come on.

363
00:28:50,465 --> 00:28:53,522
Don't do what you did
in the store. Okay?

364
00:28:54,305 --> 00:28:57,442
There's no need to...
freak out.

365
00:28:57,455 --> 00:28:58,691
No need to freak out?

366
00:28:58,706 --> 00:29:00,851
I'm trying to buy some
jerky and a slushee,

367
00:29:00,868 --> 00:29:03,590
and suddenly you're standing
there over by the ho hos.

368
00:29:03,606 --> 00:29:05,873
You're dead.
What do you expect me to do?

369
00:29:05,888 --> 00:29:09,391
Can we just... sit down?

370
00:29:09,406 --> 00:29:11,952
I may be in a mental hospital,
but I know you're dead,

371
00:29:11,967 --> 00:29:16,192
and I'm not having an imaginary
conversation with you.

372
00:29:16,605 --> 00:29:19,182
I am dead.

373
00:29:21,625 --> 00:29:24,393
But I'm also here.

374
00:29:25,045 --> 00:29:27,552
Okay, prove it.

375
00:29:34,477 --> 00:29:36,952
Okay. Okay.

376
00:29:46,058 --> 00:29:50,031
Did you know you were going to
die when you swam out there?

377
00:29:58,476 --> 00:29:59,903
Why didn't you tell me?

378
00:29:59,917 --> 00:30:03,300
Because you would have
tried to stop me.

379
00:30:03,315 --> 00:30:08,330
And since I was gonna do it anyway, I
thought I would spare you all the drama.

380
00:30:10,265 --> 00:30:13,181
And now you have
to do something.

381
00:30:13,737 --> 00:30:16,832
But you're hiding from it.

382
00:30:16,848 --> 00:30:20,913
That's the real reason you ran
when you saw me in the store.

383
00:30:20,926 --> 00:30:24,730
- You knew I was here to tell you-
- no, I'm not listening to this.

384
00:30:24,747 --> 00:30:26,242
No, 'cause you're not here.

385
00:30:26,256 --> 00:30:27,793
I am here. You're being a baby.

386
00:30:27,805 --> 00:30:31,812
I'm gonna close my eyes and count to
five, and when I open 'em, you'll
be gone.

387
00:30:31,828 --> 00:30:33,123
- I am here.
- One...

388
00:30:33,135 --> 00:30:34,740
- don't do this.
- Two...

389
00:30:34,757 --> 00:30:36,001
- they need you.
- Three...

390
00:30:36,016 --> 00:30:37,821
- they need you, hugo.
- Four!

391
00:30:37,837 --> 00:30:40,582
- You know they need you.
- Five!

392
00:30:55,895 --> 00:30:58,922
What... what happened?

393
00:31:01,476 --> 00:31:04,543
I mean, how-- how did he...

394
00:31:06,565 --> 00:31:09,672
He was trying to help us.

395
00:31:45,226 --> 00:31:46,573
Jack

396
00:31:50,946 --> 00:31:53,140
You********

397
00:31:53,997 --> 00:31:56,503
*********

398
00:32:00,227 --> 00:32:02,693
it's not loaded.

399
00:32:08,206 --> 00:32:09,871
Let go of me!

400
00:32:13,167 --> 00:32:15,561
- Do you know what he did?
- Yes, I know what he did!

401
00:32:15,578 --> 00:32:17,311
All I did...

402
00:32:18,356 --> 00:32:21,210
All I have ever done...

403
00:32:21,627 --> 00:32:23,631
Has been in the best
interest of all of us.

404
00:32:23,645 --> 00:32:25,973
Are you insane?

405
00:32:29,555 --> 00:32:30,562
I know I...

406
00:32:30,577 --> 00:32:32,221
I have a lot of
explaining to do.

407
00:32:32,235 --> 00:32:36,592
But I never did anything
to hurt any of you.

408
00:32:36,607 --> 00:32:39,711
I even risked my life to tell you that
there was a traitor in your midst.

409
00:32:39,725 --> 00:32:40,982
She helped us, John.

410
00:32:40,996 --> 00:32:45,663
All you ever did was blow up every
chance we had of getting off
this island.

411
00:32:45,676 --> 00:32:47,240
You killed Naomi!

412
00:32:47,256 --> 00:32:50,811
Well, technically,
he didn't kill her yet.

413
00:32:50,827 --> 00:32:53,061
Yes, he did.

414
00:32:54,977 --> 00:32:57,260
She just died.

415
00:32:57,567 --> 00:32:59,282
She didn't give you up, John.

416
00:32:59,298 --> 00:33:02,971
She covered for us,
and she fixed this.

417
00:33:02,986 --> 00:33:05,202
They're on their way.

418
00:33:05,797 --> 00:33:08,161
She didn't cover for anyone.

419
00:33:08,176 --> 00:33:11,690
She wants her people
to come here.

420
00:33:11,708 --> 00:33:15,592
And trust me, when they do,
we had better be far away from here.

421
00:33:15,607 --> 00:33:16,992
I'm going to the barracks.

422
00:33:17,015 --> 00:33:18,483
The others abandoned them.

423
00:33:18,508 --> 00:33:21,262
It's the only place on the island
with any form of security right now.

424
00:33:21,277 --> 00:33:24,693
It'll have to do until I
can think of something else.

425
00:33:25,178 --> 00:33:30,981
Until then, if you want to live,
you need to come with me.

426
00:33:30,998 --> 00:33:34,923
No one's going anywhere with you,
John, because they're not crazy.

427
00:33:34,937 --> 00:33:37,203
He's not crazy.

428
00:33:38,016 --> 00:33:40,290
What about Charlie?

429
00:33:42,757 --> 00:33:47,092
Charlie went down to that place
so we could all be rescued.

430
00:33:52,387 --> 00:33:55,981
And whatever he did down there...
it worked.

431
00:33:58,735 --> 00:34:01,911
But then something
must've happened.

432
00:34:02,887 --> 00:34:05,922
He must have heard
something before he...

433
00:34:10,286 --> 00:34:14,613
I don't know why,
but it changed his mind.

434
00:34:20,817 --> 00:34:26,690
Because the last thing he did was to
warn us at the people on that boat are
not who they said they were.

435
00:34:41,086 --> 00:34:43,972
So I'm not listening to you.

436
00:34:46,836 --> 00:34:49,532
I'm listening to my friend.

437
00:34:52,687 --> 00:34:55,310
I'm listening to Charlie.

438
00:35:08,897 --> 00:35:11,023
Anyone else?

439
00:35:14,038 --> 00:35:16,343
There isn't much time.

440
00:35:30,075 --> 00:35:33,053
Jack, with your permission,
I'd like to go with John.

441
00:35:37,538 --> 00:35:40,071
He's all yours.

442
00:35:54,486 --> 00:35:56,020
You said we'd never
leave the island.

443
00:35:56,057 --> 00:36:00,963
If you, uh, you wanna go with Locke,
I'll be right behind ya.

444
00:36:00,977 --> 00:36:04,210
I'm not going anywhere
with that man.

445
00:36:13,625 --> 00:36:15,703
What are you doing?

446
00:36:20,498 --> 00:36:23,590
Same thing I've
always done, Kate...

447
00:36:24,125 --> 00:36:26,620
Survivin'.

448
00:36:46,575 --> 00:36:50,142
You know where to find us
when you change your mind.

449
00:37:34,877 --> 00:37:36,900
You ever miss?

450
00:37:40,516 --> 00:37:42,082
Jack.

451
00:37:42,097 --> 00:37:45,993
Yeah. I was, uh,
on my way back from a consult.

452
00:37:46,646 --> 00:37:49,962
Thought I'd drop by
and pay you a visit.

453
00:37:51,468 --> 00:37:52,642
Horse?

454
00:37:52,655 --> 00:37:54,541
You're on.

455
00:37:55,658 --> 00:37:57,720
So... consult, huh?

456
00:37:57,738 --> 00:38:00,622
Does that mean you're back
doing surgical stuff?

457
00:38:00,638 --> 00:38:02,432
Yeah.

458
00:38:08,505 --> 00:38:09,753
"H. "

459
00:38:09,766 --> 00:38:12,110
Reporters leaving you alone?

460
00:38:15,027 --> 00:38:16,141
Yeah.

461
00:38:16,157 --> 00:38:19,971
Still have to sign some autographs
when I go out for coffee, but...

462
00:38:20,736 --> 00:38:23,502
Thinking about growing a beard.

463
00:38:25,827 --> 00:38:28,211
You'd look weird
with a beard, dude.

464
00:38:28,677 --> 00:38:30,963
That's h-O.

465
00:38:30,978 --> 00:38:32,912
So...

466
00:38:35,436 --> 00:38:38,410
What are you really
doing here, Jack?

467
00:38:41,918 --> 00:38:46,042
I was just checking on you,
seeing if everything was okay.

468
00:38:46,057 --> 00:38:50,641
You're checking to see if I went nuts,
if I was gonna tell.

469
00:38:52,597 --> 00:38:54,530
Are you?

470
00:38:58,727 --> 00:39:00,511
You're up.

471
00:39:02,966 --> 00:39:05,941
Nah, you win. I, uh...

472
00:39:07,677 --> 00:39:09,941
Gotta run.

473
00:39:11,615 --> 00:39:14,613
It was gat seeing you, Hurley.

474
00:39:19,816 --> 00:39:22,162
I'm sorry.

475
00:39:27,288 --> 00:39:30,650
I'm sorry I went with Locke.

476
00:39:32,277 --> 00:39:35,463
I should've stayed with you.

477
00:39:36,207 --> 00:39:39,261
It's water under
the bridge, man.

478
00:39:43,998 --> 00:39:47,163
I don't think we did
the right thing, Jack.

479
00:39:47,177 --> 00:39:49,183
- I think it wants us to come back.
- Hurley...

480
00:39:49,198 --> 00:39:52,532
- and it's gonna do everything it can-
- we're never going back.

481
00:40:03,518 --> 00:40:05,820
Never say never, dude.

482
00:40:29,197 --> 00:40:31,693
Are you thinking of Charlie?

483
00:40:32,618 --> 00:40:36,721
Feels like a hundred years ago
that we came out here together.

484
00:40:38,235 --> 00:40:40,752
How did this happen?

485
00:40:49,657 --> 00:40:52,351
Thunder's getting louder.

486
00:40:56,536 --> 00:40:59,852
That's not thunder. Come on.

487
00:41:11,086 --> 00:41:12,510
Come on.

488
00:41:38,058 --> 00:41:40,141
Are you Jack?
