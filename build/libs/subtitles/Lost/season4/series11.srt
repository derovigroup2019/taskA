3
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:36,040
Where do you think you're going?

4
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:37,330
Out.

5
00:00:37,430 --> 00:00:38,840
With who?

6
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:40,420
Him?

7
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:42,350
Yes, and you can't stop me.

8
00:00:42,470 --> 00:00:43,850
I'm in love.

9
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:45,665
He's twice your age, Emily.

10
00:00:45,765 --> 00:00:47,020
So what, mom?

11
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:48,930
Are you jealous?

12
00:00:49,030 --> 00:00:50,540
Emily, wait a minute.

13
00:00:50,650 --> 00:00:53,270
Emily, listen to me!

14
00:00:53,390 --> 00:00:54,900
Emily!

15
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:56,840
Get back here, young lady,
right now!

16
00:00:56,940 --> 00:00:58,820
You can't stop me!
I love him!

17
00:01:00,450 --> 00:01:01,680
Emily!

18
00:01:08,370 --> 00:01:10,810
Honey, can you hear me?

19
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:14,530
Honey, can you hear me?

20
00:01:15,550 --> 00:01:16,570
That's good.

21
00:01:16,670 --> 00:01:18,110
Try and stay awake now.

22
00:01:18,350 --> 00:01:20,870
Keep it steady.
Out of the way.

23
00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:23,440
She's bleeding.
Her heartbeat's dropping fast.

24
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:24,740
I'm pregnant.

25
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:25,790
What?

26
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:26,690
What did you say?

27
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:27,670
I'm pregnant.

28
00:01:27,770 --> 00:01:29,870
I'm five-- I'm almost six months.

29
00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:31,450
She-she's pregnant.

30
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:35,390
Get the clamps ready.

31
00:01:35,830 --> 00:01:37,610
That's it, Emily.
Good girl.

32
00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:39,460
- Baby's crowning.
- She's crowning.

33
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:41,640
Dilated and ready to go.

34
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:43,530
That's it.

35
00:01:44,990 --> 00:01:48,150
Okay, sweetheart.
All right, there you go.

36
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:50,250
Wrap you up nice and warm.

37
00:01:50,530 --> 00:01:52,860
We'll just take you over here now.

38
00:01:53,210 --> 00:01:55,340
Margaret, would you put
him in for me, please?

39
00:01:56,730 --> 00:01:58,140
My baby.

40
00:02:00,170 --> 00:02:01,580
It's a boy, honey.

41
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:05,860
He's okay for now.
He's just real early.

42
00:02:07,430 --> 00:02:08,800
Can I hold him?

43
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:09,910
I'm sorry, sweetheart.

44
00:02:10,010 --> 00:02:11,265
He's just too little.

45
00:02:11,365 --> 00:02:13,070
We have to take him away now.

46
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:14,980
But...

47
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:21,540
Name--name him John.

48
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:23,130
Please!

49
00:02:23,390 --> 00:02:25,310
His name is John!

50
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:31,890
Who builds a cabin in the
middle of the jungle anyway?

51
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:34,330
That's a good question.

52
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:37,380
So? How about answering it?

53
00:02:37,970 --> 00:02:39,700
I don't know.

54
00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:42,680
And why are we even going there?

55
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:44,900
Because hopefully,
the man who lives in the cabin

56
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,980
can tell us what to do about the
people who are trying to kill us.

57
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:51,880
We've been walking all day.
Are we gonna get there soon?

58
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:54,690
How long?

59
00:02:55,950 --> 00:02:57,450
I don't know.

60
00:02:57,610 --> 00:02:59,270
I've been following him.

61
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:00,280
What?

62
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:01,490
What do you mean,
you've been following him?

63
00:03:01,790 --> 00:03:02,720
I'm not even in front.

64
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:03,910
I have no idea where the cabin is.

65
00:03:04,010 --> 00:03:05,120
Hugo's the last one that saw it.

66
00:03:05,230 --> 00:03:06,140
Oh, this is just awesome.

67
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:08,330
What do you think we should do, John?

68
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:12,200
We're making camp.

69
00:03:13,770 --> 00:03:15,110
What?

70
00:03:15,210 --> 00:03:18,260
Here in the dark with the monster and...

71
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:19,540
him?

72
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:20,780
The rest will do us good.

73
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:23,660
Dude, what's gonna happen when
those freighter guys come back?

74
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:25,790
I don't know...

75
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,000
yet.

76
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:43,930
Desmond.

77
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:46,160
The helicopter's here.

78
00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:56,740
All right, get him on the litter.

79
00:03:58,150 --> 00:03:59,450
Careful with him!

80
00:03:59,550 --> 00:04:00,810
Get him down over there.

81
00:04:01,530 --> 00:04:02,590
Be careful.

82
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:06,220
Okay, guys, unload it.

83
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:08,540
Come on. Pick it up.
Pick it up. Let's go.

84
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:10,390
What did this to him?

85
00:04:11,010 --> 00:04:14,060
A black pillar of smoke threw
him 50 feet in the air,

86
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:16,790
ripped his guts out.

87
00:04:17,780 --> 00:04:19,160
What?

88
00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:22,530
I need you to tell me exactly how
many people are on that island

89
00:04:22,630 --> 00:04:24,930
and where every single one of them is.

90
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:27,240
And why would I do that?

91
00:04:28,770 --> 00:04:30,160
Keamy!

92
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:32,190
What the hell do you
think you're doing, mate?

93
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:34,540
You gave me up.

94
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:36,020
What?

95
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:38,340
Linus knew who I was.
He knew my name.

96
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:40,610
He knew everything about me.

97
00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:43,620
No, I'm not the one who gave you up.

98
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:46,200
Then who did?

99
00:05:06,710 --> 00:05:08,570
Do you know who I am?

100
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,240
What?

101
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:13,190
My name.

102
00:05:13,290 --> 00:05:14,710
Do you know my name?

103
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,140
Keamy.

104
00:05:18,790 --> 00:05:20,340
Martin Keamy.

105
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:22,950
Did you give it to him?

106
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:24,170
Who?

107
00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:25,850
Benjamin Linus--
did you give him my name?

108
00:05:27,350 --> 00:05:28,350
Yeah.

109
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:33,930
Wait. Wait!

110
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:36,730
Martin, no!

111
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:45,990
Martin, we need him.

112
00:05:46,130 --> 00:05:48,230
He's the only one who
can fix the engines.

113
00:05:48,330 --> 00:05:50,110
And what makes you so sure about that?

114
00:05:50,210 --> 00:05:52,730
Because he's the one who broke them.

115
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:56,030
Hello there.

116
00:06:56,930 --> 00:06:58,150
Who are you?

117
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:01,250
I'm Horace.

118
00:07:02,050 --> 00:07:03,620
And what are you doing out here?

119
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:07,740
Oh, building a place-- a little
getaway for me and the missus.

120
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:12,750
No, I mean, sometimes you need
a break from the D.I., you know?

121
00:07:13,970 --> 00:07:15,590
The Dharma Initiative?

122
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:19,750
I'm not making any sense, am I?

123
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:23,150
No.

124
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:30,070
That's probably because I've
been dead for 12 years.

125
00:07:45,410 --> 00:07:47,130
Hello there.

126
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,430
You gotta find me, John.

127
00:08:00,530 --> 00:08:02,050
You gotta find me.

128
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:05,170
And when you do, you'll find him.

129
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,140
Who?

130
00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:09,730
Jacob.

131
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:14,420
He's been waiting for you
a real long time, man.

132
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:21,190
I'm Horace.

133
00:08:31,930 --> 00:08:33,560
Godspeed, John.

134
00:08:43,650 --> 00:08:44,615
Hugo.

135
00:08:44,715 --> 00:08:45,640
Mallomars.

136
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:46,920
Wake up, Hugo.

137
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:50,710
What?

138
00:08:50,810 --> 00:08:52,300
Time to get up.
We're gonna get going.

139
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:54,270
I thought we didn't know
where we're going, dude.

140
00:08:54,370 --> 00:08:56,030
We do now.

141
00:09:01,310 --> 00:09:03,190
I used to have dreams.

142
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:16,000
<i>Dr. Miller, Dr. Miller,
please call the switchboard.</i>

143
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:20,350
Hi, Emily.

144
00:09:20,450 --> 00:09:22,640
Mrs. Locke, it's good to see you.

145
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:24,000
How is he?

146
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:25,370
He's amazing.

147
00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:28,580
He's the youngest preemie to
ever survive in this hospital.

148
00:09:28,970 --> 00:09:31,985
He's had infections,
pneumonia, you name it.

149
00:09:32,085 --> 00:09:34,100
And every time, he knocked them out.

150
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:36,830
He is a fighter, your little John.

151
00:09:37,950 --> 00:09:39,260
That's wonderful.

152
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:41,630
The other girls say
he's a miracle baby.

153
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:44,760
And today, we're gonna take
him out of the incubator

154
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:47,480
so you can hold him for
the very first time.

155
00:09:58,310 --> 00:09:59,490
I...

156
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:01,400
I can't do this.

157
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:03,960
I...

158
00:10:04,130 --> 00:10:05,920
I'm sorry. I can't!

159
00:10:15,270 --> 00:10:17,650
So who do I talk to about adoption?

160
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:20,520
You can't smoke in here, Mrs. Locke.

161
00:10:24,990 --> 00:10:26,450
Of course.

162
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:28,330
I'm sorry.

163
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:33,600
Is that the father?

164
00:10:35,450 --> 00:10:36,920
I, uh...

165
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:38,610
I don't know who that is.

166
00:10:50,530 --> 00:10:51,880
Can I ask you somethin'?

167
00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:54,340
Sure.

168
00:10:55,050 --> 00:10:56,690
Why am I here, man?

169
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:02,900
You're here because you can see the
cabin, and that makes you special.

170
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:07,530
Well, I have a theory as to why
we're the only ones who can see it.

171
00:11:07,630 --> 00:11:08,570
I'd love to hear it.

172
00:11:08,670 --> 00:11:11,800
I think we can see it
'cause we're the craziest.

173
00:11:14,910 --> 00:11:16,970
So how'd you figure
out where it was, dude?

174
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:18,830
I didn't.

175
00:11:19,150 --> 00:11:20,300
We're not going to the cabin.

176
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:22,290
We're gonna make a pit stop first.

177
00:11:22,630 --> 00:11:23,910
Pit stop?

178
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:25,650
Where?

179
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:29,240
You ever wonder what happened
to the Dharma Initiative, Hugo?

180
00:11:31,170 --> 00:11:34,810
There must have been at least a
hundred of 'em living on this island,

181
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:38,090
manning the stations,
building those homes,

182
00:11:38,190 --> 00:11:40,570
making all that ranch
dressing that you like.

183
00:11:41,230 --> 00:11:42,980
And then one day, they're all gone.

184
00:11:43,110 --> 00:11:44,550
They just disappeared.

185
00:11:46,250 --> 00:11:47,860
You want to know where we're going?

186
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:56,500
We're going to see them.

187
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:05,400
Wow.

188
00:12:09,580 --> 00:12:11,020
What happened to 'em?

189
00:12:12,010 --> 00:12:13,410
He did.

190
00:12:25,410 --> 00:12:27,170
That game's stupid.

191
00:12:27,270 --> 00:12:29,590
He's right in here.
Come on in.

192
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:32,980
Melissa, stop that!

193
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:35,220
Co on now. Take your
brother in the kitchen.

194
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:37,850
There's someone here
who wants to see John.

195
00:12:37,950 --> 00:12:40,400
It is coming down like
cats and dogs out there.

196
00:12:41,930 --> 00:12:44,480
This nice gentleman wants
to talk to you, John.

197
00:12:44,690 --> 00:12:46,730
So I want you on your best behavior.

198
00:12:46,830 --> 00:12:48,490
Understand?

199
00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:51,790
He's all yours.

200
00:12:55,910 --> 00:12:57,510
You like Backgammon?

201
00:12:58,110 --> 00:12:59,110
Yeah?

202
00:12:59,210 --> 00:13:01,220
You seem to have a pretty
good sense of the game.

203
00:13:04,230 --> 00:13:05,950
I'm Richard, John.

204
00:13:08,070 --> 00:13:11,390
I run a school for kids who are...

205
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:13,270
extremely special,

206
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:17,850
and I have reason to believe
that you might be one of them.

207
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:24,200
Mind if I show you a couple
of really neat things?

208
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:38,050
Did you draw that, John?

209
00:13:51,650 --> 00:13:53,930
I want you to look at these things...

210
00:13:58,540 --> 00:14:00,350
and think about 'em.

211
00:14:20,290 --> 00:14:22,410
Okay, now tell me, John,

212
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:26,140
which of these things belong to you?

213
00:14:28,890 --> 00:14:30,500
T-to keep?

214
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:32,800
No, no, John.

215
00:14:33,170 --> 00:14:36,630
Which of these things
belong to you already?

216
00:15:42,190 --> 00:15:43,960
Are you sure the knife
belongs to you, John?

217
00:15:44,060 --> 00:15:45,470
You sure about that?

218
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:53,280
Well, it doesn't.

219
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:03,600
How did he do?

220
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:06,280
I'm afraid John isn't
quite ready for our school.

221
00:16:06,390 --> 00:16:08,210
I'm sorry I've wasted your time.

222
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:15,690
What did you do?

223
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:27,390
What's he doing down there?

224
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:34,660
So...

225
00:16:35,370 --> 00:16:37,790
this is where you shot Locke
and left him for dead, huh?

226
00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:43,460
Yes, Hugo, I was standing right where
you are now when I pulled the trigger.

227
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:50,630
Should have realized at the time
that it was pointless, but...

228
00:16:50,730 --> 00:16:52,780
I really wasn't thinking clearly.

229
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:57,780
Is that why you killed
all these people, too?

230
00:16:58,590 --> 00:17:00,600
I didn't kill them.

231
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:02,960
Well, if the others didn't wipe
out the Dharma Initiative--

232
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:05,720
They did wipe them out, Hugo,

233
00:17:05,820 --> 00:17:07,990
but it wasn't my decision.

234
00:17:08,910 --> 00:17:10,450
Then whose was it?

235
00:17:10,550 --> 00:17:12,140
Their leader's.

236
00:17:13,050 --> 00:17:15,050
But I thought you were their leader.

237
00:17:16,540 --> 00:17:18,320
Not always.

238
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:39,510
The cabin?

239
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:41,720
He was building it.

240
00:17:41,950 --> 00:17:43,680
Did you find what you were looking for?

241
00:17:44,650 --> 00:17:46,680
Yes, Hugo. I believe I did.

242
00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:54,270
I need your key.

243
00:17:54,550 --> 00:17:55,260
What?

244
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:56,720
Captain.

245
00:17:56,820 --> 00:17:58,355
Mayhews just died.

246
00:17:58,455 --> 00:17:59,920
Doc couldn't do anything for him.

247
00:18:00,020 --> 00:18:01,594
The crew's asking a lot
of questions about...

248
00:18:01,694 --> 00:18:02,980
what happened to you guys over there.

249
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:05,090
You tell the crew that
I'm dealing with it.

250
00:18:05,390 --> 00:18:07,500
Then you can go gas up
the chopper, Frank.

251
00:18:07,610 --> 00:18:08,530
We're going back.

252
00:18:08,630 --> 00:18:10,020
Going back?

253
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:12,650
- What the hell for?
- Gas up the chopper, Frank.

254
00:18:15,550 --> 00:18:17,010
Okay.

255
00:18:18,220 --> 00:18:20,060
Listen, Martin.

256
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:23,250
While you were gone, there
was some sort of a sickness.

257
00:18:23,550 --> 00:18:26,130
The crew...they've been exhibiting
some very strange behavior.

258
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:28,475
Regina threw herself
overboard, for God's sake.

259
00:18:28,575 --> 00:18:30,620
Now I would be derelict in my
duty if I didn't point out

260
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:33,330
that this might be exactly
what's happening to you.

261
00:18:34,370 --> 00:18:36,280
I appreciate your concern.

262
00:18:38,970 --> 00:18:40,600
Give me your key.

263
00:18:41,010 --> 00:18:42,960
That's not the protocol--

264
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:47,120
Thank you.

265
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:57,690
The reason there are two keys is we're
only supposed to open the safe together.

266
00:18:57,790 --> 00:18:59,550
You're here, aren't you?

267
00:19:02,670 --> 00:19:03,700
What is that?

268
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:05,830
It's the secondary protocol.

269
00:19:09,790 --> 00:19:10,840
What does it say?

270
00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:12,660
It says where Linus is going.

271
00:19:13,770 --> 00:19:15,610
How would Mr. Widmore know that?

272
00:19:15,710 --> 00:19:17,580
'Cause he's a very smart man,

273
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:21,140
and if Linus knows that
we're gonna torch the island,

274
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:23,835
there's only one place that he can go.

275
00:19:23,935 --> 00:19:26,240
What do you mean,"torch the island"?

276
00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:27,550
That was not the agreement.

277
00:19:27,650 --> 00:19:30,710
I agreed to ferry you here
for an extraction mission.

278
00:19:35,930 --> 00:19:37,630
Fix my gun.

279
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:50,100
That injured man...

280
00:19:51,180 --> 00:19:52,890
that was no gunshot.

281
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:57,670
What do you think happened to him?

282
00:19:58,340 --> 00:19:59,840
I don't know.

283
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:02,560
But when they go back, they'll
be certain it doesn't happen again.

284
00:20:03,230 --> 00:20:04,780
Omar!

285
00:20:06,860 --> 00:20:08,390
Keamy wants you in the armory.

286
00:20:08,490 --> 00:20:10,680
He said I wasn't supposed to
let those two out of my sight.

287
00:20:10,780 --> 00:20:12,750
I'll watch them. Go.

288
00:20:23,150 --> 00:20:26,020
There's a pantry below our galley
with enough room for two men.

289
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:27,740
I've left you a supply
of food and water.

290
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:28,840
You need to go there.

291
00:20:28,940 --> 00:20:30,190
Michael--is he dead?

292
00:20:30,290 --> 00:20:31,810
No, but not for lack of bloody trying,

293
00:20:31,910 --> 00:20:33,695
which is precisely why
you two need to be...

294
00:20:33,795 --> 00:20:35,580
hiding before Keamy
comes back on this deck.

295
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:37,830
Hiding is pointless.

296
00:20:37,990 --> 00:20:40,100
Give us your zodiac raft so we can start...

297
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:42,210
ferrying people back
here from the beach.

298
00:20:43,290 --> 00:20:48,620
The only way to save our lives is
to get our people off that island.

299
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:54,070
Meet me behind the
container in ten minutes.

300
00:20:55,180 --> 00:20:57,140
The boat will be in the water.

301
00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:03,880
The cabin's here.

302
00:21:04,990 --> 00:21:06,350
I came from over there.

303
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:07,960
Up the coast.

304
00:21:09,210 --> 00:21:10,120
Here you go.

305
00:21:12,390 --> 00:21:13,250
Drink up, dude.

306
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,580
Digging through dead bodies
takes it out of you.

307
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:19,440
It's gonna be dark soon, Hugo.

308
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:22,140
If you head that way,
you'll hit the coast,

309
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:25,510
and all you have to do is take it
north until you reach our beach.

310
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:27,260
Uh, what?

311
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:29,640
I forced you to come with us
at gun point, and I'm sorry,

312
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:33,610
Hugo, but I was led to believe that
we needed you to find this place.

313
00:21:33,730 --> 00:21:34,205
Oh, I get it.

314
00:21:34,305 --> 00:21:36,000
Now you got your magic map,
you don't--

315
00:21:36,140 --> 00:21:37,205
you don't need me anymore.

316
00:21:37,305 --> 00:21:38,800
I'm offering you a chance to leave.

317
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:42,815
I don't want to put you in
harm's way against your will.

318
00:21:42,915 --> 00:21:44,431
And you think walking through the jungle...

319
00:21:44,531 --> 00:21:45,975
at night by myself is
gonna be any safer?

320
00:21:46,075 --> 00:21:47,260
I'm not sure it is.

321
00:21:48,970 --> 00:21:50,720
I think I'll stick with you guys.

322
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:52,720
This way?

323
00:21:58,740 --> 00:21:59,800
What?

324
00:21:59,970 --> 00:22:02,550
He actually thinks staying was his idea.

325
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:06,530
Not bad, John. Not bad at all.

326
00:22:08,770 --> 00:22:10,280
I'm not you.

327
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:15,510
You're certainly not.

328
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:26,690
Somebody, let me out!

329
00:22:26,890 --> 00:22:27,950
Please let me out.

330
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:31,735
- Please, somebody, let me--
- John, you okay?

331
00:22:31,835 --> 00:22:32,670
I'm fine.

332
00:22:32,990 --> 00:22:33,810
I'm fine.

333
00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:36,005
Get to class, ladies.

334
00:22:36,105 --> 00:22:37,750
Tardy bell just rang.

335
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:40,120
John, you're bleeding.

336
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:41,030
Come on.

337
00:22:41,210 --> 00:22:42,880
Let's go to the nurse's office.

338
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:49,550
- You wanna talk about it?
- No.

339
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:55,908
I know you're probably upset right now,

340
00:22:56,008 --> 00:22:58,690
but I do have some
exciting news for you.

341
00:22:58,970 --> 00:23:01,100
I got a call from Portland recently.

342
00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:04,320
There's a company up there
doing some very exciting things

343
00:23:04,420 --> 00:23:06,590
in chemistry and new technologies.

344
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:09,450
They're called Mittelos Laboratories.

345
00:23:10,350 --> 00:23:12,320
I spoke with a Dr. Alpert.

346
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:15,290
He's very interested in
finding young, bright minds

347
00:23:15,390 --> 00:23:17,650
to enter in these new fields of science.

348
00:23:17,990 --> 00:23:20,960
They want you to go to
their camp this summer.

349
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:23,230
Science camp?

350
00:23:23,330 --> 00:23:24,410
Yes.

351
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,975
Don't you understand that things
like science camp are the reason

352
00:23:28,075 --> 00:23:29,720
why I get stuffed into lockers?

353
00:23:29,830 --> 00:23:32,310
- John, this is a great opportunity.
- How do they even know about me?

354
00:23:32,410 --> 00:23:34,540
Well, they must have sent
a rep to the science fair,

355
00:23:34,750 --> 00:23:36,330
your display at Costa Mesa.

356
00:23:36,430 --> 00:23:39,000
I'm not a scientist!

357
00:23:39,650 --> 00:23:42,930
I like boxing and fishing and cars.

358
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:44,420
I like sports!

359
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:47,490
I'm gonna tell you something,

360
00:23:47,730 --> 00:23:50,815
something I wish someone
had told me at your age.

361
00:23:50,915 --> 00:23:53,417
You might not want to be
that guy in the labs,

362
00:23:53,517 --> 00:23:55,960
surrounded by test
tubes and beakers,

363
00:23:57,080 --> 00:23:59,160
but that's who you are, John.

364
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:03,550
You can't be the prom king.

365
00:24:03,850 --> 00:24:06,100
You can't be the quarterback.

366
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:11,460
You can't be a superhero.

367
00:24:13,740 --> 00:24:17,550
Don't tell me what I can't do.

368
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:33,580
Why didn't you tell me?

369
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:35,660
Tell you what?

370
00:24:37,230 --> 00:24:39,770
That you're a survivor of 815.

371
00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:41,780
'Cause you wouldn't have believed me.

372
00:24:41,990 --> 00:24:43,230
You didn't think I'd believe you?

373
00:24:43,330 --> 00:24:45,500
I tell you that I'm one of
the only people in the world

374
00:24:45,610 --> 00:24:48,445
that think that that plane on the
bottom of the ocean is a hoax,

375
00:24:48,545 --> 00:24:50,010
and you didn't think I'd believe you?

376
00:24:50,110 --> 00:24:51,430
I didn't know if I could trust you.

377
00:24:51,550 --> 00:24:53,200
Your boss put that plane there.

378
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:58,480
Man, I thought I was Mr. Conspiracy,
but you got me beat there.

379
00:25:01,350 --> 00:25:02,420
Listen to me.

380
00:25:02,550 --> 00:25:03,450
Listen to me.

381
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:05,675
You can't fly that guy back. Keamy.

382
00:25:05,775 --> 00:25:07,280
You let me worry about Keamy, all right?

383
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:08,530
You can't fly him back!

384
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:11,535
He is gonna kill
everyone on that island.

385
00:25:11,635 --> 00:25:12,570
Everyone.

386
00:25:14,790 --> 00:25:17,075
And you don't want that
on your conscience, man.

387
00:25:17,175 --> 00:25:18,620
Trust me.

388
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:36,000
Hey, boss.

389
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:38,670
Just getting him down
to the engine room.

390
00:25:48,090 --> 00:25:50,880
Stay on a heading of exactly 3-0-5.

391
00:25:51,150 --> 00:25:53,430
Faraday says that's the only
safe way to and from the boat.

392
00:25:53,550 --> 00:25:55,950
What will you tell Keamy if he
notices the zodiac is missing?

393
00:25:56,050 --> 00:25:57,220
I'll tell him you stole it.

394
00:25:58,340 --> 00:25:59,350
Now go.

395
00:26:07,620 --> 00:26:08,760
Desmond.

396
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:10,290
I can't go with you.

397
00:26:10,950 --> 00:26:11,950
Why not?

398
00:26:12,100 --> 00:26:14,070
I've been on that
island for three years.

399
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:16,960
I'm never setting foot on it again.

400
00:26:17,930 --> 00:26:19,730
Not when Penny's coming for me.

401
00:26:23,290 --> 00:26:25,860
I'll be back with the first
group as soon as I can.

402
00:26:27,510 --> 00:26:29,040
Stay on that bearing, yeah?

403
00:26:30,140 --> 00:26:31,430
I will.

404
00:26:31,790 --> 00:26:33,440
You need to go.
Now.

405
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:05,050
It should be about 200 yards this way.

406
00:27:05,380 --> 00:27:06,900
You sure it's gonna be there, John?

407
00:27:08,540 --> 00:27:09,360
I'm sorry?

408
00:27:09,460 --> 00:27:11,935
The cabin. What if it's moved again?

409
00:27:12,035 --> 00:27:16,090
It hasn't moved because I was told
that this is where it would be.

410
00:27:17,090 --> 00:27:21,600
I was told a lot of things, too.
That I was chosen, that I was special.

411
00:27:21,980 --> 00:27:26,210
I end up with a tumor on my spine and
my daughter's blood all over my hands.

412
00:27:28,310 --> 00:27:30,890
I'm sorry those things
happened to you, Ben.

413
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:35,240
Those things had to happen to me.

414
00:27:35,770 --> 00:27:37,520
That was my destiny.

415
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:40,755
But you'll understand soon enough

416
00:27:40,855 --> 00:27:43,070
that there are consequences
to being chosen,

417
00:27:45,570 --> 00:27:51,000
because, destiny, John,
is a fickle bitch.

418
00:27:54,260 --> 00:27:55,420
Guys?

419
00:27:58,330 --> 00:27:59,490
Cabin.

420
00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:33,960
Okay, okay, okay.

421
00:28:34,060 --> 00:28:34,570
Good job, man.

422
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:35,320
Good job, John.

423
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:37,380
Okay, we'll try it some more tomorrow.

424
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:39,240
He's all yours.

425
00:28:39,710 --> 00:28:40,590
Come on up.

426
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:43,370
It's all right. Come on.

427
00:28:47,590 --> 00:28:49,030
Don't give up, Mr. Locke.

428
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:51,990
Excuse me?

429
00:28:52,330 --> 00:28:53,790
I'm just saying, don't give up.

430
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:55,290
Anything's possible.

431
00:28:57,700 --> 00:28:59,450
You should read my file.

432
00:29:00,510 --> 00:29:02,480
My spine was crushed.

433
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:06,175
There's a 98% chance I'll never
get any feeling back in my legs.

434
00:29:06,275 --> 00:29:07,514
So I don't know
why I'm even trying to--

435
00:29:07,614 --> 00:29:10,400
As a matter of fact,
I did read your file.

436
00:29:11,010 --> 00:29:13,920
You survived falling eight
stories out of a building.

437
00:29:15,750 --> 00:29:18,100
That's a miracle, Mr. Locke.

438
00:29:23,030 --> 00:29:24,340
Let me ask you something.

439
00:29:25,900 --> 00:29:27,620
Do you believe in miracles?

440
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:29,500
No.

441
00:29:29,660 --> 00:29:31,720
I don't believe in miracles.

442
00:29:32,510 --> 00:29:33,770
You should.

443
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:35,910
I had one happen to me.

444
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:45,050
Hey, look. I just want
to go back to my room.

445
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:55,250
You know what you need, Mr. Locke?

446
00:29:57,590 --> 00:29:59,730
You need to go on a walkabout.

447
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:02,960
Wha-what's a walkabout?

448
00:30:03,330 --> 00:30:05,490
It's a journey of self-discovery.

449
00:30:06,850 --> 00:30:08,800
You go out into the
Australian outback

450
00:30:08,900 --> 00:30:11,310
with nothing more than
a knife and your wits.

451
00:30:12,750 --> 00:30:14,940
I can't "walkabout" anything.

452
00:30:15,070 --> 00:30:18,240
In case you haven't?noticed,
I'm a cripple.

453
00:30:19,930 --> 00:30:21,840
Is that what you are, Mr. Locke?

454
00:30:24,050 --> 00:30:28,760
I went on my walkabout convinced I was
one thing, but I came back another.

455
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:32,360
I found out what I was made of,
who I was.

456
00:30:32,590 --> 00:30:35,630
And here you are, an orderly.

457
00:30:38,370 --> 00:30:41,150
Oh, I'm a lot more than
just an orderly, John.

458
00:30:58,110 --> 00:30:59,650
When you're ready, Mr. Locke,

459
00:31:00,420 --> 00:31:02,080
you'll listen to what I'm saying.

460
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:05,710
And then, when you and me
run into each other again...

461
00:31:08,630 --> 00:31:10,270
you'll owe me one.

462
00:31:33,750 --> 00:31:37,630
Hey, Doc.
Wanna hear something weird?

463
00:31:39,070 --> 00:31:40,360
Yeah, sure.

464
00:31:40,870 --> 00:31:43,535
You know that morse code message
that I got from the beach?

465
00:31:43,635 --> 00:31:47,040
It said that the doctor washed up
on the shore with his throat slit.

466
00:31:48,670 --> 00:31:50,260
But I'm the doctor.

467
00:31:51,010 --> 00:31:52,320
Crazy, right?

468
00:31:53,310 --> 00:31:54,490
Everything here?

469
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:55,930
Yes, sir.

470
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:57,420
Good. Get it packed up.

471
00:32:03,380 --> 00:32:05,000
What are you gonna do with all that?

472
00:32:06,530 --> 00:32:08,020
Fire her up, Frank.

473
00:32:09,340 --> 00:32:13,310
Mr. Keamy, I was hired
to fly scientists.

474
00:32:14,060 --> 00:32:17,480
Get your ass in the cockpit
and fire up the chopper, Frank.

475
00:32:18,110 --> 00:32:19,760
I'm not taking you.

476
00:32:25,590 --> 00:32:27,130
I'll kill you, Frank.

477
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:29,820
Yeah, well, you do that, you'll
never get back to the island

478
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:31,730
'cause I'm the only pilot you got.

479
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:42,430
Sorry, Doc.

480
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:52,890
Does that change anything, Frank?
Huh?

481
00:32:53,250 --> 00:32:55,710
Another 30 seconds goes by
and someone else's turn--

482
00:32:59,930 --> 00:33:01,190
I fixed your gun.

483
00:33:05,780 --> 00:33:08,500
Now stand down, Martin,
or I will fire.

484
00:33:17,580 --> 00:33:19,810
I don't think you want
to do that, Captain.

485
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:21,990
What's that on his arm?

486
00:33:22,910 --> 00:33:24,210
What's that on his arm?

487
00:33:34,810 --> 00:33:35,810
Hey!

488
00:33:39,050 --> 00:33:40,700
What'll it be, Frank?

489
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:44,840
We're flying.

490
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:51,300
Come on. Let's go, boys.

491
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:51,930
Come on!

492
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:53,930
<i>Bring the rest of the weapons on board.
Let's go</i>

493
00:33:54,170 --> 00:33:55,100
<i>Let's go!</i>

494
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:57,200
<i>- Everything's down in here.
- Let's move out.</i>

495
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:16,030
Thanks, Captain.

496
00:34:20,180 --> 00:34:21,330
Come on, come on, come on, come on!

497
00:34:21,570 --> 00:34:22,270
Let's go!

498
00:34:54,830 --> 00:34:57,320
Hey! What did I say to you?

499
00:34:58,510 --> 00:35:00,000
You told me not to leave my tent.

500
00:35:01,550 --> 00:35:02,320
I was hungry.

501
00:35:02,420 --> 00:35:04,060
Jack, you have to rest.

502
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:05,610
You can't run around.

503
00:35:05,970 --> 00:35:07,653
I know that it is hard
for you to ask for help

504
00:35:07,753 --> 00:35:09,200
but if you tear your stitches--

505
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:10,560
Right.
Okay.

506
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:12,530
I got it.

507
00:35:13,180 --> 00:35:14,940
Doctors make the worst patients.

508
00:35:58,400 --> 00:35:59,260
Jack!

509
00:36:28,810 --> 00:36:30,590
I think they want us to follow 'em.

510
00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:46,330
All right.

511
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:48,350
Let's do this.

512
00:36:48,690 --> 00:36:50,110
I'm not going in there with you.

513
00:36:51,170 --> 00:36:52,130
What?

514
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:56,500
The island wanted me to get sick,
and it wanted you to get well.

515
00:36:58,410 --> 00:37:00,100
My time is over, John.

516
00:37:02,030 --> 00:37:03,240
It's yours now.

517
00:37:05,860 --> 00:37:09,700
Yeah, I'm cool with you
going in alone, too.

518
00:37:19,750 --> 00:37:20,970
Good luck, John.

519
00:38:24,190 --> 00:38:25,400
Are you Jacob?

520
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:28,770
No.

521
00:38:31,260 --> 00:38:33,540
But I can speak on his behalf.

522
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:44,610
Well, who are you?

523
00:38:48,470 --> 00:38:49,640
I'm Christian.

524
00:39:11,370 --> 00:39:12,820
You know why I'm here?

525
00:39:15,330 --> 00:39:16,880
Yeah, sure.

526
00:39:17,830 --> 00:39:19,010
Do you?

527
00:39:24,350 --> 00:39:25,440
I'm here...

528
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:29,600
because I was chosen to be.

529
00:39:34,460 --> 00:39:35,890
That's absolutely right.

530
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:49,540
Claire?

531
00:39:50,790 --> 00:39:52,120
Hi, John.

532
00:39:53,530 --> 00:39:54,610
What are you doing here?

533
00:39:54,710 --> 00:39:56,070
Don't worry. I'm fine.

534
00:39:56,170 --> 00:39:57,150
I'm with him.

535
00:40:01,190 --> 00:40:02,170
Wh-- where's the baby?

536
00:40:02,270 --> 00:40:05,850
The baby's where he's supposed
to be, and that's not here.

537
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:12,030
It's probably best that you don't
tell anyone that you saw her.

538
00:40:12,170 --> 00:40:12,960
Why?

539
00:40:13,190 --> 00:40:15,420
- Why is she--
- We don't have time for this.

00:40:15,590 --> 00:40:19,020
The people from the boat are
already on their way back,

541
00:40:19,450 --> 00:40:22,780
and once they get here, all of these
questions won't matter one bit.

542
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:26,400
So why don't you ask the one
question that does matter?

543
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:37,990
How do I save the island?

544
00:41:52,730 --> 00:41:54,660
Did he tell you what
we're supposed to do?

545
00:41:56,920 --> 00:41:58,130
He did.

546
00:42:00,020 --> 00:42:01,310
Well?

547
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:05,660
He wants us to move the island.

00:42:06,380 --> 00:42:08,880
