1
00:00:00,940 --> 00:00:02,990
Previously on "Lost"...

2
00:00:04,540 --> 00:00:07,230
- We'll get you back here asap.
- I'm sorry, George.

3
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:09,850
Just tell my sister
that I love her.

4
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:12,440
You killed Naomi!

5
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:15,050
She wants her people
to come here.

6
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:18,030
And trust me, when they do,
we had better be far away from here.

7
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:20,930
If you want to live,
you need to come with me.

8
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:23,510
No one's going anywhere
with you, John.

9
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:31,120
What are you doing?

10
00:00:31,137 --> 00:00:35,090
Same thing I've always done,
Kate-- survivin'.

11
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:42,110
The thunder is getting louder.

12
00:00:58,032 --> 00:00:59,959
Sorry, Ron.

13
00:01:00,319 --> 00:01:03,918
Drone's got nothing but seafood
at 5,000 mers below.

14
00:01:05,999 --> 00:01:08,653
You picking anything
up with yours?

15
00:01:09,528 --> 00:01:10,613
Zip.

16
00:01:10,625 --> 00:01:14,211
I'm trying to get her a peek over
this ridge as soon as I can.

17
00:01:14,226 --> 00:01:17,113
Sonar's pinging
up something now.

18
00:01:17,128 --> 00:01:19,222
Hey, you wanna switch feeds?

19
00:01:19,238 --> 00:01:21,153
Roger that.

20
00:01:22,308 --> 00:01:28,780
I'm headed on a bearing of about 1-3-7
from the coordinates we pulled off our
guy's map.

21
00:01:29,486 --> 00:01:32,102
But don't hold your breath.

22
00:01:34,248 --> 00:01:38,691
Magnetometer is picking up a hell
of a lot of anolies down here.

23
00:01:38,708 --> 00:01:40,643
A chest full of doubloons?

24
00:01:41,048 --> 00:01:42,273
Keep dreaming, Ron.

25
00:01:42,285 --> 00:01:45,492
Let's swing around on the
next bridge and recalibrate.

26
00:01:48,025 --> 00:01:49,993
Are you getting this?

27
00:01:50,006 --> 00:01:52,063
What? What's up?

28
00:01:53,978 --> 00:01:55,763
It's...

29
00:01:55,778 --> 00:01:58,060
It's an airplane.

30
00:02:03,187 --> 00:02:05,641
Oh, my god.

31
00:02:05,658 --> 00:02:08,151
It's Oceanic 815.

32
00:02:14,638 --> 00:02:17,303
This haunting footage comes
to us from the Christiane I,

33
00:02:17,317 --> 00:02:19,583
a salvage vehicle in
the indian ocean.

34
00:02:19,598 --> 00:02:23,420
For more than two months, it's been
scouring the depths of the Sunda trench
off Bali

35
00:02:23,436 --> 00:02:26,792
in search of the remains
of sunken trading ships.

36
00:02:26,807 --> 00:02:31,930
Late last night, the "Christiane"
deployed two remotely operated vehicles,
or R.O.V.S.

37
00:02:31,948 --> 00:02:35,733
That verified what the national
transportation safety board had
long feared,

38
00:02:35,745 --> 00:02:37,340
{\a6}Essex, Massachusetts

39
00:02:37,358 --> 00:02:37,641
that the aircraft...
- How you want your eggs, Dan?

40
00:02:37,675 --> 00:02:40,810
disappeared after departing Sydney,
Australia, on september 22nd, 2004...

41
00:02:40,828 --> 00:02:43,801
So what happened?
They found that missing plane?

42
00:02:43,815 --> 00:02:46,700
- This confirms that flight 815...
- Dan?

43
00:02:46,717 --> 00:02:49,661
- Did in fact crash at sea.
- Dan?

44
00:02:49,677 --> 00:02:51,403
Even with this
tragic discovery...

45
00:02:51,418 --> 00:02:55,830
- dan,why are you so upset?
- Victims families say that they're 

46
00:02:56,725 --> 00:02:58,410
left without any sense of closure.
- I don't know.

47
00:03:04,867 --> 00:03:05,703
I can't find my vest!

48
00:03:05,717 --> 00:03:07,980
- Check under your seat!
- I already did!

49
00:03:07,998 --> 00:03:11,072
Get ready! Re, just take mine!

50
00:03:12,348 --> 00:03:14,893
Everybody out! Now!

51
00:03:14,907 --> 00:03:16,160
Hey, genius!

52
00:03:16,178 --> 00:03:18,170
- No,no!
- Go!

53
00:04:06,937 --> 00:04:08,352
Hey there.

54
00:04:08,917 --> 00:04:11,012
Are you jack?

55
00:04:14,125 --> 00:04:16,173
Yeah, I'm jack.

56
00:04:17,216 --> 00:04:19,292
Who are you?

57
00:04:22,476 --> 00:04:25,260
I'm daniel faraday.

58
00:04:27,946 --> 00:04:29,653
I'm here to rescue you.

62
00:05:00,796 --> 00:05:04,171
Hey, dan the chopper--
how many of you were on it?

63
00:05:04,188 --> 00:05:06,312
Uh, four, including me.

64
00:05:06,327 --> 00:05:08,840
So what happened to
the rest of them?

65
00:05:09,776 --> 00:05:12,112
Yeah, yeah, I,
uh, have no idea.

66
00:05:12,128 --> 00:05:15,470
I don't know how many of 'em were
able to get out before it went down.

67
00:05:15,488 --> 00:05:19,153
I just-- I jumped, and I lost my,
uh, what do you call it? My--my pack.

68
00:05:19,166 --> 00:05:21,703
My phone was in my pack.
If I had my phone, I would just, uh...

69
00:05:21,718 --> 00:05:23,801
We have a phone.

70
00:05:25,227 --> 00:05:27,142
You--you have a phone.

71
00:05:28,547 --> 00:05:30,580
Thank you. Thanks.

72
00:05:32,815 --> 00:05:33,743
Minkowski.

73
00:05:33,755 --> 00:05:34,831
He George.

74
00:05:34,847 --> 00:05:36,201
It's Daniel.

75
00:05:36,218 --> 00:05:36,720
- Dan?
- Yeah.

76
00:05:36,738 --> 00:05:39,061
The chopper com went dead.
What the hell happened up there?

77
00:05:39,097 --> 00:05:41,863
Yeah, I don't know. George, there was--
there was an electrical storm.

78
00:05:41,896 --> 00:05:43,972
All the instruments, they just--
I think they went down.

79
00:05:43,985 --> 00:05:47,131
But listen, I made-- I made
contact with some of the survivors,

80
00:05:47,148 --> 00:05:50,453
and, uh, we were just, uh--
- Dan, am I on speaker?

81
00:05:54,288 --> 00:05:57,323
Would you give me
just-- just one second?

82
00:06:01,897 --> 00:06:03,143
- Don't worry.
- I don't know...

83
00:06:03,177 --> 00:06:05,611
Naomi covered for us.

84
00:06:05,866 --> 00:06:07,922
They don't know what
Locke did to her.

85
00:06:07,938 --> 00:06:09,921
You sure about that?

86
00:06:16,458 --> 00:06:17,421
Okay, okay.

87
00:06:17,435 --> 00:06:19,541
So the boat hasn't heard
from anybody else yet,

88
00:06:19,555 --> 00:06:22,180
but, uh, these are
G.P.S. transponders,

89
00:06:22,197 --> 00:06:24,040
and my team and I are
all wearing these.

90
00:06:24,055 --> 00:06:27,131
The transponrs will send the
locations back to the ship,

91
00:06:27,147 --> 00:06:32,031
and then the ship will send all
the locations back into the phones.

92
00:06:32,865 --> 00:06:38,140
Oh, there is my signal right there, and
hopefully, we'll get the signals from
the rest of the team soon.

93
00:06:38,156 --> 00:06:40,243
Will you help me find 'em?

94
00:06:40,255 --> 00:06:41,432
Absolutely.

95
00:06:41,448 --> 00:06:44,032
Okay. Thank you.

96
00:06:46,125 --> 00:06:48,651
Hey, where are the
rest of your people?

97
00:06:48,985 --> 00:06:51,433
Most of them are
back at the beach.

98
00:06:51,445 --> 00:06:53,200
Most of them?

99
00:07:07,868 --> 00:07:10,101
Dude what's wrong with you?

100
00:07:10,116 --> 00:07:12,752
You're gonna get
struck by lightning.

101
00:07:15,656 --> 00:07:17,173
Storm's about to pass, Hugo.

102
00:07:17,188 --> 00:07:19,482
It's a freakin' monsoon.
We gotta...

103
00:07:26,407 --> 00:07:28,270
Let's go.

104
00:07:38,586 --> 00:07:40,502
Why you going east?

105
00:07:40,797 --> 00:07:42,773
I thought you said the
barracks were due south.

106
00:07:42,787 --> 00:07:45,330
Because, James,
we have to make a little detour first.

107
00:07:45,367 --> 00:07:47,271
Detour to what?

108
00:07:47,288 --> 00:07:49,420
There's a cabin
I have to go to.

109
00:07:49,435 --> 00:07:51,930
But the cabin was
back that way.

110
00:07:52,445 --> 00:07:54,890
What did you say, Hugo?

111
00:07:58,116 --> 00:08:02,111
I, uh, thought your were talking
about the airplane cabin.

112
00:08:04,305 --> 00:08:06,662
Why are we wasting our time
going to some shack anyway?

113
00:08:06,676 --> 00:08:08,021
Because we're supposed to.

114
00:08:08,035 --> 00:08:12,782
Right, like you were supposed to throw
a knife into that Naomi chick's back?

115
00:08:17,658 --> 00:08:21,131
You mind telling us who you're getting
your orders from, colonel Kurtz?

116
00:08:22,325 --> 00:08:24,642
I got 'em from Walt.

117
00:08:38,335 --> 00:08:40,261
Jack still isn't back.

118
00:08:42,537 --> 00:08:44,382
Anything?

119
00:08:44,806 --> 00:08:48,100
No, but it's a big island.

120
00:08:48,116 --> 00:08:50,853
The freighter could be
approaching from the other side.

121
00:08:50,865 --> 00:08:52,891
That's the spiriT.

122
00:08:55,326 --> 00:08:57,880
Juliet, you lived
amongst the others.

123
00:08:57,895 --> 00:09:01,591
Why would Ben say the people
coming here intend to do us harm?

124
00:09:01,605 --> 00:09:06,380
Because he's a liar and he's trying
to scare us. That's what Ben does.

125
00:09:08,317 --> 00:09:12,870
Or because the people coming
here intend to do us harm.

126
00:09:15,215 --> 00:09:18,440
How many guns do you have left?

127
00:09:32,448 --> 00:09:34,301
Is that from your chopper?

128
00:09:36,758 --> 00:09:39,312
Yeah, yeah.
That, uh, yeah, they...

129
00:09:39,328 --> 00:09:41,780
Reduced the weight load
when we started going down.

130
00:09:42,725 --> 00:09:46,100
I guess that's why
they pushed me out.

131
00:09:46,847 --> 00:09:48,970
What's this for?

132
00:09:53,248 --> 00:09:57,533
I'm not in charge of,
uh, packing, so...

133
00:09:57,548 --> 00:09:58,431
You're not, huh?

134
00:09:58,445 --> 00:09:59,931
We should, uh...

135
00:09:59,945 --> 00:10:03,310
- Daniel, why did you bring the gun?
- You wanna keep moving?

136
00:10:09,307 --> 00:10:11,683
Yeah... as a precaution.

137
00:10:11,695 --> 00:10:13,841
Precaution against what?

138
00:10:18,566 --> 00:10:21,112
Uh, okay, see, um...

139
00:10:22,327 --> 00:10:25,293
Rescuing you and your people...

140
00:10:26,348 --> 00:10:31,061
Can't really say its
our primary objective.

141
00:10:31,726 --> 00:10:34,210
Then what is?

142
00:10:41,905 --> 00:10:45,441
It's Miles.
It's Miles. Come on.

143
00:10:46,656 --> 00:10:48,780
What the hell do you
mean you saw Walt?

144
00:10:48,790 --> 00:10:49,920
In a dream?

145
00:10:49,932 --> 00:10:52,019
No dream. It was Walt.

146
00:10:52,029 --> 00:10:54,848
Only... taller.

147
00:10:55,149 --> 00:10:56,222
Taller?

148
00:10:56,238 --> 00:10:58,201
What, like a giant?

149
00:11:00,658 --> 00:11:03,423
Okay, what exactly
did walt tell you?

150
00:11:03,435 --> 00:11:06,883
He said I had work to do,
that I had to stop is woman, Naomi,

151
00:11:06,897 --> 00:11:08,832
from bringing the rest
of her people here.

152
00:11:08,846 --> 00:11:10,751
What, you didn't ask
any follow-up questions?

153
00:11:10,765 --> 00:11:12,560
Ben had shot me and
left me for dead.

154
00:11:12,576 --> 00:11:16,720
Walt saved my life,
so I pretty much took him at his word.

155
00:11:16,736 --> 00:11:22,011
He shot you, yet here you are, fit as
a fiddle, trompin' through the jungle.

156
00:11:24,546 --> 00:11:28,680
The bullet went in one side,
came out the other.

157
00:11:35,888 --> 00:11:39,022
I'd probably be dead if I
still had a kidney there.

158
00:11:39,888 --> 00:11:42,542
Anything else?

159
00:12:09,565 --> 00:12:11,560
It's down there.

160
00:12:12,667 --> 00:12:14,772
Hey, Miles!

161
00:12:17,327 --> 00:12:19,333
Miles!

162
00:12:33,048 --> 00:12:34,553
Is he dead?

163
00:12:34,568 --> 00:12:36,571
Back up, handsome.

164
00:12:38,555 --> 00:12:40,971
Miles! Take it easy. It's okay.

165
00:12:40,985 --> 00:12:42,450
They're here to help us.

166
00:12:42,465 --> 00:12:44,632
It's okay, Miles.
They're just trying to help.

167
00:12:44,645 --> 00:12:46,101
Back away from him!

168
00:12:46,118 --> 00:12:47,282
Hands where I can see 'em!

169
00:12:47,296 --> 00:12:49,630
Kate, it's all right.

170
00:12:49,647 --> 00:12:51,620
It's okay.

171
00:12:51,635 --> 00:12:53,532
You're Kate!

172
00:12:55,138 --> 00:12:57,913
You wanna tell me
where Naomi is?

173
00:12:59,137 --> 00:12:59,862
What?

174
00:12:59,876 --> 00:13:02,571
Naomi-- the woman you killed!

175
00:13:03,905 --> 00:13:05,812
Where is she?

176
00:13:11,557 --> 00:13:14,713
{\a6}Inglewood, California

177
00:13:14,727 --> 00:13:16,482
For friends and families of
the passengers of Oceanic 815,

178
00:13:16,495 --> 00:13:19,730
this can only be described
as the worst-case scenario.

179
00:13:19,746 --> 00:13:22,661
With the plane accounted for
and a salvage mission unlikely,

180
00:13:22,677 --> 00:13:27,853
authorities are confirming
all 324 passengers dead.

181
00:13:41,057 --> 00:13:42,532
Ms. Gardner?

182
00:13:42,836 --> 00:13:43,930
I'm Miles Straume.

183
00:13:43,948 --> 00:13:45,392
We spoke on the phone earlier.

184
00:13:45,405 --> 00:13:47,632
Oh, please come in.

185
00:13:59,945 --> 00:14:01,162
Which room is it?

186
00:14:01,178 --> 00:14:03,690
It's upstairs at
the end of the hall.

187
00:14:03,706 --> 00:14:05,352
I get paid in advance.

188
00:14:05,407 --> 00:14:07,550
$200, cash only.

189
00:14:07,566 --> 00:14:08,453
You told me $100 on the phone.

190
00:14:08,487 --> 00:14:12,851
That was before my buddy at the police
station told me your grandson
was murdered.

191
00:14:14,476 --> 00:14:16,670
It's gonna be $200.

192
00:14:16,686 --> 00:14:18,170
Fine.

193
00:14:42,075 --> 00:14:45,421
No matter what you hear,
don't come up.

194
00:15:26,596 --> 00:15:30,103
You're not doing your grandmother
any good staying here, man.

195
00:15:30,935 --> 00:15:33,302
You're causing her
a lot of pain...

196
00:15:37,537 --> 00:15:41,630
I wanna go downstairs
and tell her you've gone.

197
00:15:42,136 --> 00:15:47,373
But the only way I'm gonna be able to
do that is if you tell me where it is.

198
00:15:52,737 --> 00:15:54,751
So where is it?

199
00:16:31,725 --> 00:16:33,900
You can go now.

200
00:16:40,097 --> 00:16:41,792
Did it work?

201
00:16:43,026 --> 00:16:44,371
Yeah.

202
00:16:46,076 --> 00:16:48,310
He's at peace now.

203
00:16:56,197 --> 00:16:57,933
Here.

204
00:16:58,998 --> 00:17:02,123
You get a refund, half off.

205
00:17:02,137 --> 00:17:04,771
Wasn't as tricky as I thought.

206
00:17:07,288 --> 00:17:09,082
Thank you.

207
00:17:09,616 --> 00:17:11,211
Thank you.

208
00:17:12,698 --> 00:17:14,262
Miles. Miles!

209
00:17:14,665 --> 00:17:16,442
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

210
00:17:16,457 --> 00:17:17,433
These are good people.

211
00:17:17,445 --> 00:17:19,380
They why'd Naomi
use the damn code?

212
00:17:19,396 --> 00:17:22,711
Yeah, you remember when she said,
"tell my sister I love her"?

213
00:17:22,737 --> 00:17:25,021
Well, she doesn't
have a sister.

214
00:17:25,258 --> 00:17:29,833
That's what we're supposed to say if we
get captured and have a gun to
our heads.

215
00:17:30,118 --> 00:17:33,882
Like right now jack here would say,
"tell my sister I love her. "

216
00:17:33,897 --> 00:17:35,110
You get it?

217
00:17:35,125 --> 00:17:37,282
We didn't kill your friend.

218
00:17:37,796 --> 00:17:38,842
Then take me to her body.

219
00:17:38,875 --> 00:17:41,221
Miles, what about Charlotte?

220
00:17:41,236 --> 00:17:42,013
What about Frank?

221
00:17:42,025 --> 00:17:45,333
- Take me to Naomi!
- Naomi was killed, but not by us.

222
00:17:45,345 --> 00:17:48,091
It was-- it was a man by
the name of John Locke.

223
00:17:48,105 --> 00:17:49,101
He's not with us anymore.

224
00:17:49,115 --> 00:17:50,933
Kate, seriously,
if I have to ask you again--

225
00:17:50,947 --> 00:17:52,391
Look, even if I took
you to her body,

226
00:17:52,416 --> 00:17:55,332
- you wouldn't know what happened.
- I'll know!

227
00:17:55,946 --> 00:17:58,592
Now take me to her body.

228
00:18:14,537 --> 00:18:16,393
Alex.

229
00:18:17,708 --> 00:18:19,563
Alex, hey.

230
00:18:20,277 --> 00:18:21,143
What?

231
00:18:21,158 --> 00:18:22,611
Something I need to tell you.

232
00:18:22,626 --> 00:18:25,281
Keep your mouth shut,
Mr. Linus.

233
00:18:25,808 --> 00:18:27,403
Karl.

234
00:18:27,416 --> 00:18:30,910
Now if you're gonna sleep with my
daughter, I insist you call me Ben.

235
00:18:30,928 --> 00:18:32,393
Easy kid.

236
00:18:32,406 --> 00:18:34,902
Guy's just trying
to get in your head.

237
00:18:36,418 --> 00:18:38,720
Go take a walk or somethin'.

238
00:18:45,058 --> 00:18:47,091
Mind if I ask you
a question, James?

239
00:18:47,106 --> 00:18:49,301
Yeah, I do.

240
00:18:49,507 --> 00:18:51,833
Why'd you leave Kate behind?

241
00:18:52,608 --> 00:18:55,352
You're wasting your time, Yoda.

242
00:18:55,995 --> 00:18:58,820
I know it's not pleasant,
but let's face it.

243
00:18:58,837 --> 00:19:01,890
You really don't
stand a chance now.

244
00:19:01,907 --> 00:19:03,783
Chance at what?

245
00:19:03,798 --> 00:19:06,850
James, look at yourself.

246
00:19:06,868 --> 00:19:10,260
Yes, on this island,
you're brave, daring, handsome.

247
00:19:10,288 --> 00:19:11,371
You're someone.

248
00:19:11,387 --> 00:19:13,623
But if you left with them...

249
00:19:14,416 --> 00:19:17,580
Back in the real world,
a lowlife scam artist like you

250
00:19:17,597 --> 00:19:21,552
could never compete with
a first-class surgeon.

251
00:19:21,965 --> 00:19:26,451
I think Kate was really upset when
you made your choice to come with us.

252
00:19:28,436 --> 00:19:31,400
Thank god she has Jack
there to comfort her--

253
00:19:33,788 --> 00:19:35,000
James!

254
00:19:36,235 --> 00:19:38,242
- Don't.
- Don't what?

255
00:19:39,316 --> 00:19:41,550
Anyone want to tell me why
we're keeping this guy alive?

256
00:19:41,566 --> 00:19:45,402
We're keeping him alive because he's
been on this island a lot longer than
any of us,

257
00:19:45,418 --> 00:19:50,552
because he has information we need, and
because apart from his mouth, he's
completely harmless.

258
00:19:50,566 --> 00:19:53,103
His mouth put that
hole in your gut?

259
00:19:53,916 --> 00:19:59,842
Okay, James, let's execute him
right here, right now, in front of
his daughter.

260
00:20:19,508 --> 00:20:22,743
It's only a matter of time
before he gets us, Johnny.

261
00:20:23,476 --> 00:20:27,012
And I'll bet he's already
figured out how he's gonna do it.

262
00:20:29,396 --> 00:20:31,771
So you walk him.

263
00:20:57,965 --> 00:20:59,822
What is he doing?

264
00:21:00,436 --> 00:21:02,763
The light...

265
00:21:02,778 --> 00:21:06,150
Is strange out here,
isn't it? It's...

266
00:21:06,167 --> 00:21:11,261
It's kind like it doesn't--
it doesn't scatter quite right.

267
00:21:13,637 --> 00:21:15,423
Dan?

268
00:21:15,776 --> 00:21:18,312
Your name's Dan, right?

269
00:21:19,486 --> 00:21:24,390
Listen, dan, I know that you don't
want anybody to get hurt, right?

270
00:21:24,407 --> 00:21:27,783
So why don't you
just put that away?

271
00:21:29,827 --> 00:21:34,112
Because, um, Miles...
would kill me?

272
00:21:34,947 --> 00:21:36,202
But we're just trying to help--

273
00:21:36,218 --> 00:21:37,913
Kate, you're
wasting your breath.

274
00:21:37,926 --> 00:21:41,311
Let's just let this play out
and see what happens, okay?

275
00:21:46,898 --> 00:21:48,611
They didn't kill her.

276
00:21:48,627 --> 00:21:50,863
It happened like
they said it did.

277
00:21:51,715 --> 00:21:52,491
It's Charlotte.

278
00:21:52,506 --> 00:21:53,960
She's only 3
kilometers from here.

279
00:21:53,977 --> 00:21:55,093
All right, then.

280
00:21:55,105 --> 00:21:56,832
Let's go get her.

281
00:21:58,887 --> 00:21:59,843
I said let's gO.

282
00:21:59,855 --> 00:22:01,883
You need to put the guns down.

283
00:22:01,898 --> 00:22:02,671
What?

284
00:22:02,685 --> 00:22:04,653
Put the guns down.

285
00:22:05,797 --> 00:22:06,911
Now why would I do that?

286
00:22:06,928 --> 00:22:11,530
Because our friends are out in the
jungle right now holding a gun at your
head and his head.

287
00:22:12,046 --> 00:22:13,882
So I'm gonna forget about
the misunderstanding.

288
00:22:13,895 --> 00:22:15,193
Just put the guns down.

289
00:22:15,208 --> 00:22:17,442
Come on.
How stupid do you think I--

290
00:22:28,466 --> 00:22:30,440
I don't know, Miles.

291
00:22:32,048 --> 00:22:34,240
How stupid are you?

292
00:23:01,787 --> 00:23:07,023
815: RETROUVE!

293
00:23:07,315 --> 00:23:11,593
How many different languages do you have
to read that in before you believe
it's true?

294
00:23:11,918 --> 00:23:14,581
How many different
languages are there?

295
00:23:15,848 --> 00:23:17,082
Excusez-moi.

296
00:23:18,768 --> 00:23:20,390
He wants to know if we're lost.

297
00:23:20,405 --> 00:23:23,803
Remind him that people in our line of
work are terrible at keeping secrets.

298
00:23:23,817 --> 00:23:24,873
I know about the dig.

299
00:23:30,247 --> 00:23:32,213
He says the site is closed.

300
00:23:32,228 --> 00:23:34,302
Then tell him to open it.

301
00:23:49,757 --> 00:23:51,310
Dinosaur?

302
00:23:52,347 --> 00:23:54,220
Not by a few million years.

303
00:23:54,238 --> 00:23:56,081
It's an ursus maritimus.

304
00:23:56,115 --> 00:23:59,233
Wait, "ursus" as in bear?

305
00:24:01,145 --> 00:24:03,281
As in polar bear.

306
00:24:05,307 --> 00:24:07,273
Charlotte, we're in the desert.

307
00:24:07,285 --> 00:24:09,113
This is a hoax, right?

308
00:24:12,636 --> 00:24:14,701
He wants to know what you're
doing with the hammer.

309
00:24:14,737 --> 00:24:16,681
Excavating.

310
00:24:22,787 --> 00:24:24,991
Is that a collar?

311
00:25:48,517 --> 00:25:50,251
Hi yourself.

312
00:25:58,265 --> 00:26:02,903
We were worried when you didn't get
back, so we went out to the cockpit and
tracked you from there.

313
00:26:03,555 --> 00:26:05,591
Thanks for that,
for what it's worth.

314
00:26:05,608 --> 00:26:07,083
Don't mention it.

315
00:26:07,098 --> 00:26:10,060
Somebody could've told me
that the calvary were here.

316
00:26:10,747 --> 00:26:13,763
I gave you that... wink.

317
00:26:16,287 --> 00:26:18,332
What are your names?

318
00:26:18,345 --> 00:26:20,572
Uh, I'm Daniel Faraday,
and this is Miles--

319
00:26:20,586 --> 00:26:22,562
Don't tell him my last name.

320
00:26:23,446 --> 00:26:25,140
I guess this is just Miles.

321
00:26:25,155 --> 00:26:26,820
What do you do for
a living, Daniel?

322
00:26:26,835 --> 00:26:27,903
I'm a physicist.

323
00:26:27,917 --> 00:26:29,753
I mean,
I guess you could call me a physicist.

324
00:26:29,765 --> 00:26:31,693
I don't really like being
pigeonholed into one--

325
00:26:31,725 --> 00:26:35,313
Dan, I swear to god, you say one more
word, I'm gonna break your fingers.

326
00:26:35,327 --> 00:26:36,611
And what do you do, Miles?

327
00:26:36,647 --> 00:26:38,350
I collect soil samples.

328
00:26:38,365 --> 00:26:39,181
Well, that's nice.

329
00:26:39,195 --> 00:26:41,210
Well, maybe you can help me.

330
00:26:41,226 --> 00:26:43,610
You say you're not here
on a rescue mission,

331
00:26:43,625 --> 00:26:46,420
and the world at large
believes us to be dead.

332
00:26:46,835 --> 00:26:50,740
But here we are, alive and well and you
don't seem surprised to see us.

333
00:26:50,758 --> 00:26:52,073
Oh, my god.

334
00:26:52,088 --> 00:26:55,023
You guys were on
Oceanic flight 815.

335
00:26:56,258 --> 00:26:58,212
Is that better?

336
00:27:01,816 --> 00:27:04,332
I can't believe you're alive.

337
00:27:06,126 --> 00:27:08,600
How many of you are there?

338
00:27:09,396 --> 00:27:11,492
Why do you wanna know?

339
00:27:11,736 --> 00:27:14,500
Why wouldn't I want to know?

340
00:27:17,396 --> 00:27:19,550
48 of us survived the crash.

341
00:27:19,567 --> 00:27:21,953
That's not counting
the tail section.

342
00:27:21,965 --> 00:27:23,812
- They're pretty much all dead now--
- Hugo.

343
00:27:25,435 --> 00:27:28,131
So you've all been living
here this entire time?

344
00:27:30,075 --> 00:27:32,130
Is that your baby?

345
00:27:32,317 --> 00:27:34,532
Yeah. This is Aaron.

346
00:27:34,547 --> 00:27:37,020
Did you have him
here on the island?

347
00:27:37,035 --> 00:27:38,851
That's amazing.

348
00:27:40,025 --> 00:27:43,021
Well, I've got about a million
more questions I want to ask you,

349
00:27:43,037 --> 00:27:46,811
but they can wait until we
get you back to the freighter.

350
00:27:46,827 --> 00:27:50,033
We've all got one of these transponders
so if we just sit tight,

351
00:27:50,046 --> 00:27:51,872
they're gonna be
here soon, okay?

352
00:27:51,888 --> 00:27:55,730
This team of yours--
how many of you are there?

353
00:27:56,206 --> 00:27:58,390
Four, including me.

354
00:27:58,405 --> 00:28:01,062
And what happened
to your helicopter?

355
00:28:01,075 --> 00:28:03,393
I don't know.
The pilot was trying to put it down.

356
00:28:03,405 --> 00:28:04,981
Where?

357
00:28:04,995 --> 00:28:06,622
I don't know.

358
00:28:06,635 --> 00:28:07,923
I had to jump.

359
00:28:07,937 --> 00:28:09,713
It was chaos.

360
00:28:11,107 --> 00:28:14,161
I'm lucky to be alive.

361
00:28:16,506 --> 00:28:18,580
Get up. You're coming with us.

362
00:28:18,596 --> 00:28:19,962
What? What?

363
00:28:19,975 --> 00:28:22,383
We need to stay where we are
so that they can find us.

364
00:28:22,397 --> 00:28:24,582
See, there's your problem.

365
00:28:24,596 --> 00:28:26,853
We don't want to be found.

366
00:28:31,487 --> 00:28:33,453
I wouldn't mess around
with that if I were you.

367
00:28:33,466 --> 00:28:35,680
It can't hurt to try
and call someone else.

368
00:28:35,695 --> 00:28:37,782
Oh, it can hurt.

369
00:28:38,225 --> 00:28:39,400
What'd you do?

370
00:28:39,418 --> 00:28:41,292
I didn't do anything.

371
00:28:42,865 --> 00:28:45,170
Your friend-- Charlotte.

372
00:28:45,185 --> 00:28:46,913
She's moving.

373
00:28:47,457 --> 00:28:49,861
And she's moving fast.

374
00:28:52,967 --> 00:28:55,613
She's running from something.

375
00:29:22,538 --> 00:29:25,072
According to this,
she's right here.

376
00:29:25,088 --> 00:29:27,531
- Charlotte?
- Charlotte!

377
00:29:36,985 --> 00:29:38,790
Over there. Over there.

378
00:29:47,745 --> 00:29:49,020
Vincent.

379
00:29:52,996 --> 00:29:55,072
Locke's got her.

380
00:30:09,478 --> 00:30:14,110
We want to caution our viewers that the
images they are about to see are graphic
in nature.

381
00:30:14,128 --> 00:30:16,270
Viewer discretion is advised.

382
00:30:16,288 --> 00:30:22,183
Authorities have released dramatic
footage of the sunken remains of Oceanic
flight 815.

383
00:30:22,786 --> 00:30:28,570
The national transportation safety board
has set up a hotline for family members
of the Oceanic victims.

384
00:30:29,696 --> 00:30:34,343
The N.T.S.B. has begun the
victim identification process.

385
00:30:34,857 --> 00:30:39,780
We have confirmation that this is
the pilot-- captain Seth Norris.

386
00:30:41,657 --> 00:30:46,942
In a statement, the N.T.S.B. said
that, "due to the sheer depth of the...

387
00:30:47,825 --> 00:30:50,763
recovery of the bodies
would be next to impossible.

388
00:30:50,775 --> 00:30:56,713
We can only hope that identification
will provide closure to the families of
the victims."

389
00:31:08,315 --> 00:31:10,770
National transportation safety board,
Oceanic hotline.

390
00:31:10,786 --> 00:31:12,911
Yeah, let me speak
to your supervisor.

391
00:31:12,928 --> 00:31:13,720
Yes, sir.

392
00:31:13,738 --> 00:31:15,460
Are you a family member
of the deceased?

393
00:31:15,476 --> 00:31:17,602
No, I'm not, but I got
some information on the crash.

394
00:31:17,617 --> 00:31:19,171
May I please speak
to your supervisor?

395
00:31:19,206 --> 00:31:20,491
Sir, if you could
just tell me--

396
00:31:20,825 --> 00:31:22,391
Look, I'm staring at the
television right now.

397
00:31:22,426 --> 00:31:26,591
You're broadcasting footage of the
wreckage and saying that that's the
pilot, Seth Norris.

398
00:31:26,686 --> 00:31:28,092
Yes, sir?

399
00:31:28,105 --> 00:31:30,301
Well, that's not him.

400
00:31:32,285 --> 00:31:34,101
Please hold.

401
00:31:35,077 --> 00:31:36,153
Who am I speaking with?

402
00:31:36,167 --> 00:31:37,143
Doesn't matter who I am.

403
00:31:37,206 --> 00:31:39,442
You're showing footage of Seth Norris,
and that's not him.

404
00:31:39,456 --> 00:31:42,222
Listen, this guy married his
high school sweetheart at 19.

405
00:31:42,236 --> 00:31:43,490
He always wore
his wedding ring.

406
00:31:43,508 --> 00:31:46,280
And I'm telling you,
there's no ring on that body.

407
00:31:46,296 --> 00:31:48,060
Sir, it's likely the
ring fell off when--

408
00:31:48,078 --> 00:31:51,260
I'm telling ya,
that is not him.

409
00:31:51,556 --> 00:31:55,430
And how actly is it that you
know all about captain Norris?

410
00:31:56,925 --> 00:32:00,913
Because I was supposed to be
flying Oceanic 815 on that day.

411
00:33:24,406 --> 00:33:25,670
That's them.

412
00:33:25,687 --> 00:33:27,870
That's somebody from my team.

413
00:33:32,388 --> 00:33:33,832
What's wrong with you people?

414
00:33:33,845 --> 00:33:35,361
We're here because of you.

415
00:33:35,376 --> 00:33:40,092
I just almost died jumping out of a
helicopter because you called us
for help.

416
00:33:40,868 --> 00:33:42,783
Maybe we should go see
who launched that flair.

417
00:33:42,798 --> 00:33:44,320
Yeah, I mean,
they could be hurt, John.

418
00:33:44,357 --> 00:33:45,882
She's lying.

419
00:33:46,017 --> 00:33:48,120
And whatever they came for,
it isn't us.

420
00:33:48,137 --> 00:33:49,960
- We keep moving forward as planned.
- Sure.

421
00:33:49,978 --> 00:33:52,502
Who are we to argue
with taller ghost Walt?

422
00:33:52,516 --> 00:33:53,141
You know what?

423
00:33:53,157 --> 00:33:54,411
You people do
whatever you want.

424
00:33:54,447 --> 00:33:55,581
I want you to come with us.

425
00:33:55,618 --> 00:33:57,182
I'm not asking for permission.

426
00:33:57,198 --> 00:34:00,400
And if you think you're gonna
bloody stop me from getting to my--

427
00:34:07,528 --> 00:34:10,212
What did you do,
you soof a bitch?

428
00:34:19,446 --> 00:34:20,582
Vest.

429
00:34:20,598 --> 00:34:21,673
What?

430
00:34:21,685 --> 00:34:24,310
Vest. Vest.

431
00:34:38,387 --> 00:34:39,532
Is he alive?

432
00:34:39,545 --> 00:34:41,201
He's got a pulse.

433
00:34:41,216 --> 00:34:44,321
Frank? Frank.

434
00:34:44,976 --> 00:34:46,203
Frank.

435
00:34:49,096 --> 00:34:50,052
Are you okay?

436
00:34:50,068 --> 00:34:51,820
What happened?

437
00:34:53,666 --> 00:34:55,130
We got struck by lightning.

438
00:34:55,145 --> 00:34:57,621
Frank, where's Charlotte?

439
00:34:57,636 --> 00:35:00,272
She bailed out just
before we went down.

440
00:35:00,286 --> 00:35:01,280
I don't know where she is.

441
00:35:01,298 --> 00:35:03,392
Where's the chopper?

442
00:35:03,407 --> 00:35:05,293
I saw a cow.

443
00:35:08,487 --> 00:35:10,233
Lapidus, where's the chopper?

444
00:35:10,245 --> 00:35:12,183
- Where did it crash?
- Crash?

445
00:35:12,198 --> 00:35:14,552
The hell kind of
pilot you think I am?

446
00:35:14,568 --> 00:35:17,660
I put her down safe and
sound right over there.

447
00:35:45,288 --> 00:35:47,061
So this is the team?

448
00:35:47,405 --> 00:35:49,562
You've familiarized yourself
with their profiles?

449
00:35:49,576 --> 00:35:51,272
Unfortunately, yes.

450
00:35:51,285 --> 00:35:54,311
With respect, these are the wrong
people for a mission like this.

451
00:35:54,327 --> 00:35:57,371
None of them have field experience,
military training.

452
00:35:57,385 --> 00:35:59,373
You can't just drop
them in unprotected.

453
00:35:59,387 --> 00:36:00,500
It'll be a disaster.

454
00:36:00,528 --> 00:36:03,190
They're not unprotected.
They have you.

455
00:36:03,696 --> 00:36:06,240
There's only so much I can do.

456
00:36:06,575 --> 00:36:09,321
Your modesty is
positively charming.

457
00:36:10,116 --> 00:36:13,362
This is a high-risk covert
op in unstable territory.

458
00:36:13,378 --> 00:36:16,030
It's dodgy enough without
having to babysit a head case,

459
00:36:16,047 --> 00:36:18,600
ghostbuster, anthropologist
and a drunk.

460
00:36:18,615 --> 00:36:20,681
To be fair,
he's also a pretty good pilot.

461
00:36:20,695 --> 00:36:22,321
It's madness.

462
00:36:22,335 --> 00:36:24,621
What if we find
survivors from 815?

463
00:36:24,635 --> 00:36:25,912
There were no survivors.

464
00:36:25,927 --> 00:36:27,380
Yes, I know.

465
00:36:27,398 --> 00:36:28,691
But what if there
are survivors?

466
00:36:28,707 --> 00:36:32,521
There were nosurvivors
of Oceanic 815.

467
00:36:32,538 --> 00:36:33,593
Don't ask questions.

468
00:36:33,605 --> 00:36:35,363
Just do what you were hired for.

469
00:36:35,377 --> 00:36:38,393
Every member of this team was
selected for a specific purpose.

470
00:36:38,407 --> 00:36:44,171
Everything relies on you getting them
in, getting them out and preventing
anyone from getting killed.

471
00:36:44,818 --> 00:36:47,220
Think you can do that?

472
00:36:49,128 --> 00:36:50,732
Sure.

473
00:36:50,748 --> 00:36:52,382
Why not?

474
00:37:12,628 --> 00:37:13,722
Well?

475
00:37:13,736 --> 00:37:18,110
There's some minor damage,
but the mechanical systems are intact.

476
00:37:18,595 --> 00:37:19,960
So it'll fly, then?

477
00:37:19,975 --> 00:37:22,010
Absolutely.

478
00:37:22,755 --> 00:37:24,752
Can I have the phone now?

479
00:37:25,228 --> 00:37:26,502
Tell you what.

480
00:37:26,516 --> 00:37:30,470
I'll give you the phone if you tell
me what you people are doing here.

481
00:37:30,486 --> 00:37:33,720
I'll tell you what we're doing
here if you give me the phone.

482
00:37:37,958 --> 00:37:40,762
Don'n't say anything
about your sister.

483
00:37:42,687 --> 00:37:43,663
Hello?

484
00:37:43,677 --> 00:37:45,481
Regina, it's Miles.

485
00:37:45,497 --> 00:37:47,141
I need to talk to Minkowski.

486
00:37:47,155 --> 00:37:49,341
Minkowski can't come to
the phone right now.

487
00:37:50,285 --> 00:37:52,272
It's important. Go get him.

488
00:37:52,286 --> 00:37:55,120
Miles, he can't come to
the phone right now.

489
00:37:55,887 --> 00:37:58,371
All right,
have him call me when he can.

490
00:37:58,388 --> 00:37:59,840
I gotta go.

491
00:38:03,738 --> 00:38:05,152
What are you doing with her?

492
00:38:05,165 --> 00:38:06,270
We're taking her with us.

493
00:38:06,285 --> 00:38:07,121
What's the point?

494
00:38:07,137 --> 00:38:08,371
That's-- that's not Naomi.

495
00:38:08,387 --> 00:38:09,421
It's just meat.

496
00:38:09,437 --> 00:38:10,892
Miles, we can't just
leave her here.

497
00:38:10,905 --> 00:38:12,950
Miles is right.

498
00:38:13,376 --> 00:38:16,581
We burned up most of the damn
fuel flying around in that storm.

499
00:38:16,607 --> 00:38:18,621
We barely got enough to
get back to the freighter.

500
00:38:18,656 --> 00:38:21,840
We're not gonna carry
any unnecessary weight.

501
00:38:21,857 --> 00:38:24,241
I'll take her on the next run.

502
00:38:24,258 --> 00:38:26,352
I promise, Dan.

503
00:38:29,297 --> 00:38:30,960
There's a blanket over
there by my backpack.

504
00:38:30,997 --> 00:38:32,700
- Would you grab it?
- Yeah.

505
00:38:33,836 --> 00:38:35,953
Look as bad as it feels?

506
00:38:35,967 --> 00:38:38,001
How bad does it feel?

507
00:38:39,655 --> 00:38:41,763
- What's your name again?
- Juliet.

508
00:38:42,748 --> 00:38:44,301
Juliet.

509
00:38:44,648 --> 00:38:46,511
Juliet what?

510
00:38:46,526 --> 00:38:49,582
- Juliet Burke.
- Juliet Burke...

511
00:38:51,576 --> 00:38:54,002
You weren't on that plane,
were ya?

512
00:38:57,126 --> 00:38:58,622
Miles!

513
00:38:59,888 --> 00:39:01,280
Yeah?

514
00:39:01,298 --> 00:39:05,442
This is Juliet,
and she was not on the plane.

515
00:39:06,208 --> 00:39:08,203
What?

516
00:39:08,218 --> 00:39:08,993
You sure?

517
00:39:09,008 --> 00:39:11,100
You know how many times I
studied that damn manifest?

518
00:39:11,118 --> 00:39:13,790
Believe me,
there's no "Juliet Burke" on that plane.

519
00:39:13,805 --> 00:39:15,550
She's a native.

520
00:39:15,837 --> 00:39:16,812
Really?

521
00:39:16,827 --> 00:39:17,942
Where is he?

522
00:39:17,957 --> 00:39:18,990
Back off!

523
00:39:19,008 --> 00:39:19,553
Where's who?

524
00:39:19,568 --> 00:39:22,132
You wanted to know why we're here?
I'll tell you why we're here.

525
00:39:25,685 --> 00:39:28,742
We're here for Benjamin Linus.

526
00:39:33,765 --> 00:39:36,011
Now where is he?

527
00:39:36,828 --> 00:39:38,502
James, listen to me. Please--

528
00:39:38,515 --> 00:39:40,761
Keep your mouth shut.

529
00:39:40,778 --> 00:39:41,893
You okay?

530
00:39:41,906 --> 00:39:45,170
I feel like I've got a cinder block
on my chest, but I'll survive.

531
00:39:45,186 --> 00:39:46,180
I'm sorry you got shot.

532
00:39:46,825 --> 00:39:48,372
I didn't intend
for that to happen.

533
00:39:48,385 --> 00:39:49,761
Really?

534
00:39:49,778 --> 00:39:52,491
'Cause it seemed like you were
about to shoot me yourself.

535
00:39:52,507 --> 00:39:54,610
What good would
you be to me dead?

536
00:39:54,625 --> 00:39:56,403
Well, I feel much
more comfortable now.

537
00:39:56,435 --> 00:39:57,870
Thanks.

538
00:40:00,508 --> 00:40:04,202
I guess this is the part where I'm
supposed to say, "I told ya so."

539
00:40:04,915 --> 00:40:07,411
James, I stand correct.

540
00:40:07,425 --> 00:40:09,623
You want me to do it?

541
00:40:09,636 --> 00:40:11,181
No, it's my mess.

542
00:40:11,218 --> 00:40:12,900
I'll clean it up.

543
00:40:16,035 --> 00:40:16,901
No, wait!

544
00:40:16,916 --> 00:40:18,860
Danielle, you should escort
Alex away from here.

545
00:40:18,876 --> 00:40:20,182
- No! No!
- Alex, come on, let's go.

546
00:40:20,397 --> 00:40:21,803
- Come on. Alex.
- She's right. Let's go.

547
00:40:21,836 --> 00:40:24,151
Anyone who doesn't want to
see this should leave now.

548
00:40:24,167 --> 00:40:25,450
John, we should
talk about this!

549
00:40:25,488 --> 00:40:28,513
Claire, what if one of those
bullets had hit you or the baby?

550
00:40:29,206 --> 00:40:30,971
John, listen.

551
00:40:32,427 --> 00:40:35,063
I have information
that you need.

552
00:40:35,606 --> 00:40:37,921
I have answers.

553
00:40:40,228 --> 00:40:42,652
What is the monster?

554
00:40:42,666 --> 00:40:43,572
What?

555
00:40:43,585 --> 00:40:46,202
The black smoke, the monster.

556
00:40:46,217 --> 00:40:48,132
What is it?

557
00:40:48,855 --> 00:40:50,640
I don't know.

558
00:40:51,538 --> 00:40:52,872
Good-bye, Benjamin.

559
00:40:52,887 --> 00:40:55,621
Her name is Charlotte Lewis.

560
00:40:58,897 --> 00:41:01,930
Charlotte Staples Lewis.

561
00:41:02,237 --> 00:41:05,642
Born July 2nd, 1979,
Essex, England.

562
00:41:05,656 --> 00:41:07,092
Parents-- David and Jeanette.

563
00:41:07,108 --> 00:41:09,400
Eldest of three, all girls.

564
00:41:09,415 --> 00:41:13,521
She was raised in Bromsgrove,
did her undergraduate studies at Kent,

565
00:41:13,538 --> 00:41:17,283
took her phd in cultural
anthropology at Oxford.

566
00:41:17,295 --> 00:41:19,760
She's here with two other
team members and a pilot.

567
00:41:19,776 --> 00:41:25,350
Their names-- Daniel Faraday,
Miles Straume, Frank Lapidus.

568
00:41:32,585 --> 00:41:35,050
Your instinct was right, John.

569
00:41:35,456 --> 00:41:38,520
These people are a threat,

570
00:41:38,795 --> 00:41:42,552
and if you shoot me, you'll never
know how great a threat they were,

571
00:41:42,976 --> 00:41:45,681
because I know what
they're doing here.

572
00:41:45,697 --> 00:41:48,530
I know what they want.

573
00:41:48,718 --> 00:41:51,281
What do they want?

574
00:41:52,127 --> 00:41:54,922
Me, James. They want me.

575
00:42:03,065 --> 00:42:05,170
How do you know all this?

576
00:42:09,336 --> 00:42:11,643
Because I have a
man on their boat.
