1
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:56,570
These are the last two eggs.

2
00:01:04,550 --> 00:01:06,485
From my own bookshelf?

3
00:01:06,585 --> 00:01:07,795
Help you pass the time.

4
00:01:07,895 --> 00:01:09,185
I've already read it.

5
00:01:09,285 --> 00:01:12,600
You might catch something you
missed the second time around.

6
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:18,215
Why did you move me from
the rec room down here?

7
00:01:18,315 --> 00:01:21,090
I wanted you under my own roof.

8
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:25,805
Where are you keeping
your other prisoner?

9
00:01:25,905 --> 00:01:27,930
Miles, is it?

10
00:01:28,130 --> 00:01:29,095
Oh, you don't want to share.

11
00:01:29,195 --> 00:01:32,429
Actually, I was hoping you
would share, Ben, seeing...

12
00:01:32,529 --> 00:01:34,850
as you claim to have a spy on his ship.

13
00:01:39,380 --> 00:01:42,810
I feel for you, John. I really do.

14
00:01:43,090 --> 00:01:46,290
You keep hitting dead ends.

15
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:49,985
You couldn't find the cabin.

16
00:01:50,085 --> 00:01:51,655
You can't make contact with Jacob.

17
00:01:51,755 --> 00:01:54,226
You're so desperate
to figure out what...

18
00:01:54,326 --> 00:01:56,920
to do next, you're even
asking me for help.

19
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:02,635
So here we are, just like old times...

20
00:02:02,735 --> 00:02:06,230
except I'm locked in a different room.

21
00:02:08,170 --> 00:02:11,980
And you're more lost than you ever were.

22
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,545
I know what you're trying to do.

23
00:02:14,645 --> 00:02:16,045
It's not gonna work.

24
00:02:16,145 --> 00:02:16,935
Excellent, John.

25
00:02:17,035 --> 00:02:18,505
You're evolving.

26
00:02:18,605 --> 00:02:21,240
Done with your breakfast?

27
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:43,720
What's that all about?

28
00:02:44,990 --> 00:02:46,095
Who knows?

29
00:02:46,195 --> 00:02:48,150
It's Locke.

30
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:51,000
Mornin', ladies.

31
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:52,615
Good morning.

32
00:02:52,715 --> 00:02:54,260
Mornin'.

33
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:57,675
Mmm, coffee smells good.

34
00:02:57,775 --> 00:03:01,530
Well...why don't I go make you a cup?

35
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:10,380
Kinda weird, ain't it?

36
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:14,445
Sittin' on porches, drinking
coffee out of mugs.

37
00:03:14,545 --> 00:03:16,925
Anyway, I found some
clothes about your size.

38
00:03:17,025 --> 00:03:19,000
Hung 'em in a closet.

39
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:21,215
So after I kick out Hugo...

40
00:03:21,315 --> 00:03:23,780
I'm not moving in with you, James.

41
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:26,885
Well... then why did you stay?

42
00:03:26,985 --> 00:03:29,285
That's none of your business.

43
00:03:29,385 --> 00:03:32,400
Oh, you got a secret agenda, huh?

44
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:33,955
Well, if you're
spying for Jack--

45
00:03:34,055 --> 00:03:35,375
I'm not spying for anyone.

46
00:03:35,475 --> 00:03:38,290
- So why don't you tell me--
- Because I don't trust you.

47
00:03:41,810 --> 00:03:44,710
This is about the pregnancy thing.

48
00:03:48,450 --> 00:03:50,620
- James...
- Yeah?

49
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:53,240
Go home.

50
00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:58,010
Okay, fine.

51
00:04:00,330 --> 00:04:02,940
See you later, then.

52
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:16,110
Are you ready?

53
00:04:16,490 --> 00:04:18,005
Is there a back entrance?

54
00:04:18,105 --> 00:04:22,750
Yeah, but you're going in the front
door with your head held high, okay?

55
00:04:24,650 --> 00:04:27,660
Yeah. Okay.

56
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:30,840
Let's do this.

57
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:34,420
Why'd you do it, Kate?

58
00:04:38,770 --> 00:04:40,305
Coming through.

59
00:04:40,405 --> 00:04:43,085
Hey, folks, we're not
making any statements...

60
00:04:43,185 --> 00:04:45,330
or answering any questions right now.

61
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:49,590
Excuse us.

62
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:52,255
The people against
Katherine Anne Austen.

63
00:04:52,355 --> 00:04:55,215
The honorable Arthur
Galzethron presiding.

64
00:04:55,315 --> 00:04:58,680
The bailiff will read the counts.
Will the defendant please rise?

65
00:05:00,010 --> 00:05:02,645
Katherine Anne Austen,
you are charged with...

66
00:05:02,745 --> 00:05:05,205
fraud, arson, assault
on a federal officer,

67
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:10,015
assault with a deadly weapon, grand
larceny, grand theft auto

68
00:05:10,115 --> 00:05:12,405
and murder in the first degree.

69
00:05:12,505 --> 00:05:15,300
Miss Austen, how do you plead?

70
00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:20,335
Not guilty.

71
00:05:20,435 --> 00:05:21,475
Thus entered.

72
00:05:21,575 --> 00:05:23,910
I'll now hear argument on bail.

73
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:26,885
Your honor, we are requesting
that the defendant be...

74
00:05:26,985 --> 00:05:29,510
remanded into custody for
the duration of the trial.

75
00:05:29,810 --> 00:05:31,985
Your honor, my client's been
free pending arraignment.

76
00:05:32,085 --> 00:05:33,415
Now suddenly she's a flight risk?

77
00:05:33,515 --> 00:05:35,315
She's the very definition
of a flight risk.

78
00:05:35,415 --> 00:05:37,745
She has one of the most
recognizable faces in America.

79
00:05:37,845 --> 00:05:38,985
Where is she going to run?

80
00:05:39,085 --> 00:05:41,328
Miss Austen, based on your prior...

81
00:05:41,428 --> 00:05:44,325
history, I'm inclined
to agree wh the people.

82
00:05:44,425 --> 00:05:47,375
You are hereby remanded into federal
custody for the duration of your trial.

83
00:05:47,475 --> 00:05:50,350
- Your honor, my-
- Bailiff, please take the defendant into custody.

84
00:05:51,730 --> 00:05:53,190
Sorry.

Lost Season 04 Episode04

88
00:06:17,910 --> 00:06:20,230
Albuquerque?

89
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:22,450
Too hot.

90
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:24,795
New York?

91
00:06:24,895 --> 00:06:26,135
Too many people.

92
00:06:26,235 --> 00:06:27,725
More than Seoul?

93
00:06:27,825 --> 00:06:29,175
What's wrong with Seoul?

94
00:06:29,275 --> 00:06:33,120
Sun, we're going to leave
this island any moment now.

95
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:38,565
I learn English...

96
00:06:38,665 --> 00:06:40,400
for you...

97
00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:46,070
to live... in...America.

98
00:06:47,930 --> 00:06:49,535
I want...

99
00:06:49,635 --> 00:06:53,645
to raise my baby at home.

100
00:06:53,745 --> 00:06:55,050
In Korea.

101
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:57,595
You mean our baby.

102
00:06:57,695 --> 00:06:59,660
Hey, look! Jack!

103
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:03,140
- Jack!
- You're okay!

104
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:06,775
Hey, man.

105
00:07:06,875 --> 00:07:10,380
This is, uh, Charlotte and Dan.

106
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:15,495
Their helicopter already took Sayid
and Desmond back to their freighter.

107
00:07:15,595 --> 00:07:19,070
They can make arrangements to
get all of us off this island.

108
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:21,710
Where's Kate?

109
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:26,230
She stayed with Locke.

110
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:32,570
Hello, Kate.

111
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:34,955
Is that blood?

112
00:07:35,055 --> 00:07:38,380
I just... killed a chicken.

113
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:40,865
What can I do for you?

114
00:07:40,965 --> 00:07:43,530
I want to talk to Miles.
Where are you keeping him?

115
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:45,765
Why do you need to talk to him?

116
00:07:45,865 --> 00:07:48,060
Well, that's personal.

117
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,155
No.

118
00:07:50,255 --> 00:07:51,855
And what gives you the right
to decide whether or not...

119
00:07:51,955 --> 00:07:53,814
You may think this is a
democracy, Kate, because...

120
00:07:53,914 --> 00:07:54,875
of the way Jack ran things.

121
00:07:54,975 --> 00:07:57,470
But this is not a democracy.

122
00:07:59,610 --> 00:08:02,625
Then I guess that
makes it a dictatorship.

123
00:08:02,725 --> 00:08:07,120
If I was a dictator, I would just
shoot you and go about my day.

124
00:08:08,150 --> 00:08:10,800
Dinner's at 6:00 if you're hungry.

125
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:21,330
Hey, Hurley! Wait.

126
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:23,325
- You bringing that to Miles?
- Yeah.

127
00:08:23,425 --> 00:08:25,875
- Yeah, Locke asked me to do it.
- Cool.

128
00:08:25,975 --> 00:08:27,385
That dude creeps me out.

129
00:08:27,485 --> 00:08:28,945
He's still in the rec room, right?

130
00:08:29,045 --> 00:08:31,630
No, I moved him to the boathouse that...

131
00:08:36,850 --> 00:08:39,065
You just totally scooby-doo'd me,
didn't you?

132
00:08:39,165 --> 00:08:40,760
Sorry.

133
00:08:41,030 --> 00:08:42,185
You're not gonna let him go, are ya?

134
00:08:42,285 --> 00:08:44,785
No. No, I promise.

135
00:08:44,885 --> 00:08:47,590
Just don't tell Locke it was me.

136
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:23,060
So the Arab traded you, too, huh?

137
00:09:32,410 --> 00:09:34,355
Do you know who I am?

138
00:09:34,455 --> 00:09:35,255
Excuse me?

139
00:09:35,355 --> 00:09:38,690
Do you know who I am?

140
00:09:39,710 --> 00:09:42,290
Do you know what I did?

141
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:46,045
What did you do?

142
00:09:46,145 --> 00:09:48,520
Answer the question.

143
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,220
Okay.

144
00:09:55,080 --> 00:10:00,005
I'll tell you what you want to know, but
you gotta do something for me first.

145
00:10:00,105 --> 00:10:01,455
I'm not letting you go.

146
00:10:01,555 --> 00:10:03,165
I don't want to be let go.

147
00:10:03,265 --> 00:10:06,200
I am exactly where I want to be.

148
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:09,515
What I want...

149
00:10:09,615 --> 00:10:13,535
is one minute... of someone's time.

150
00:10:13,635 --> 00:10:19,420
You bring him to me, and I will tell
you everything I know about you.

151
00:10:21,090 --> 00:10:23,390
Who?

152
00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:29,640
Who do you think?

153
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:44,785
Are you okay?

154
00:10:44,885 --> 00:10:46,705
Yeah, I'm fine.

155
00:10:46,805 --> 00:10:51,245
Listen, the D.A. has decided
to try this case herself,

156
00:10:51,345 --> 00:10:53,285
which means they're gonna
do a full court press,

157
00:10:53,385 --> 00:10:56,055
and we need to start
talking about cutting a deal.

158
00:10:56,155 --> 00:10:57,190
What kind of deal?

159
00:10:57,290 --> 00:11:00,483
Honestly, my best guess,
I'd say she'll take...

160
00:11:00,583 --> 00:11:03,415
a 15-year sentence, and you serve seven.

161
00:11:03,515 --> 00:11:05,470
No way.

162
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:08,935
If you go to trial, Kate, you're
looking at 20 years on each count,

163
00:11:09,035 --> 00:11:11,265
not to mention a life sentence
on the murder charge.

164
00:11:11,365 --> 00:11:11,795
No.

165
00:11:11,895 --> 00:11:15,905
Kate, you confessed to your mother
that you killed your father,

166
00:11:16,005 --> 00:11:18,935
and now she's their star witness.

167
00:11:19,035 --> 00:11:20,635
So you tell me:
What am I supposed to do?

168
00:11:20,735 --> 00:11:22,055
How am I supposed to win this thing?

169
00:11:22,155 --> 00:11:23,305
Put me on the stand.

170
00:11:23,405 --> 00:11:26,340
And take a chance with
the D.A. crossing you? No.

171
00:11:27,310 --> 00:11:29,965
The way I see it, we've
got one shot at this.

172
00:11:30,065 --> 00:11:31,525
What's that?

173
00:11:31,625 --> 00:11:34,565
We make it about character,
not about what you did or didn't do,

174
00:11:34,665 --> 00:11:37,130
but about who you are.

175
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:40,450
What do you mean, who I am?

176
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:43,125
I want him in the courtroom.

177
00:11:43,225 --> 00:11:44,425
Absolutely not.

178
00:11:44,525 --> 00:11:46,375
We need him, Kate. It'll
generate tremendous sympathy.

179
00:11:46,475 --> 00:11:47,855
Duncan, listen to me.

180
00:11:47,955 --> 00:11:50,040
You are not bringing him in here.

181
00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:53,265
All right, you wanna make this
about me, about my character? Fine.

182
00:11:53,365 --> 00:11:57,230
But you are not using my son.

183
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:06,455
Maybe we should try a number
other than the boat, like...

184
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:09,362
911.

185
00:12:11,312 --> 00:12:13,055
What's wrong?

186
00:12:13,350 --> 00:12:14,635
Nothing.

187
00:12:14,735 --> 00:12:16,855
We're just having some trouble
getting ahold of their boat.

188
00:12:16,955 --> 00:12:18,505
You haven't heard from Sayid?

189
00:12:18,605 --> 00:12:20,565
You said they left yesterday.

190
00:12:20,665 --> 00:12:22,920
And I'm sure they're fine.

191
00:12:24,490 --> 00:12:26,085
What if Locke was right?

192
00:12:26,185 --> 00:12:27,925
What if these people
are here to hurt us?

193
00:12:28,025 --> 00:12:30,650
Locke has no idea what he's doing.

194
00:12:31,010 --> 00:12:34,270
Then why is Kate with him?

195
00:12:43,810 --> 00:12:45,720
Are you sure he's got Ben in his basement?

196
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:49,015
I saw Rousseau take
him in there last night.

197
00:12:49,115 --> 00:12:49,925
Does Locke ever go out?

198
00:12:50,025 --> 00:12:52,135
No. He's been in there cooking all day.

199
00:12:52,235 --> 00:12:54,670
He invited us all over for dinner.

200
00:12:56,350 --> 00:12:59,040
Oh, can you get Aaron for me?

201
00:13:01,730 --> 00:13:04,280
Just pick him up and
rock him a little bit.

202
00:13:07,410 --> 00:13:08,785
Yeah, I'm just...

203
00:13:08,885 --> 00:13:10,955
not very good with babies.

204
00:13:11,055 --> 00:13:13,370
I wouldn't want him to get more upset.

205
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:17,440
Here, I got him.

206
00:13:22,090 --> 00:13:23,835
It's okay.

207
00:13:23,935 --> 00:13:28,270
Here we go, muffin. Yeah. There we go.

208
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:31,330
You're so good with him.

209
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:34,275
What?

210
00:13:34,375 --> 00:13:38,310
Just the last thing I ever thought
I'd be good at is being a mum.

211
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:42,075
You know, you should try it sometime.

212
00:13:42,175 --> 00:13:45,340
Hey, Aaron. Come on, sweetie.

213
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:50,720
Please rise.

214
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:55,185
Court is now in session.

215
00:13:55,285 --> 00:13:57,110
Please be seated.

216
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:04,385
Don't fire me, okay?

217
00:14:04,485 --> 00:14:05,655
What?

218
00:14:05,755 --> 00:14:06,965
We got killed in the opening.

219
00:14:07,065 --> 00:14:08,245
I had to do this.

220
00:14:08,345 --> 00:14:10,980
Does the defense have a witness?

221
00:14:11,730 --> 00:14:13,195
Yes, we do, your honor.

222
00:14:13,295 --> 00:14:17,730
The defense calls Dr. Jack
Shepherd to the witness stand.

223
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:28,703
Your honor, I'd like to
renew my objection...

224
00:14:28,803 --> 00:14:30,445
to this witness on the
basis of relevance.

225
00:14:30,545 --> 00:14:34,105
And I'm going to renew my
overruling of your objection.

226
00:14:34,205 --> 00:14:36,885
You are to be aware that this
witness did not meet the defendant

227
00:14:36,985 --> 00:14:40,595
until after the alleged crimes
she is being charged with.

228
00:14:40,695 --> 00:14:44,615
He's to be viewed as a
character witness only.

229
00:14:44,715 --> 00:14:45,175
Proceed.

230
00:14:45,275 --> 00:14:47,105
Please raise your right hand.

231
00:14:47,205 --> 00:14:49,225
Do you swear to tell the
truth, the whole truth,

232
00:14:49,325 --> 00:14:51,585
and nothing but the
truth, so help you god?

233
00:14:51,685 --> 00:14:53,160
Yes.

234
00:14:57,630 --> 00:14:59,560
Dr. Shephard...

235
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:03,585
could you please tell the ladies
and gentlemen of the jury

236
00:15:03,685 --> 00:15:05,489
if there are any of
you who don't read...

237
00:15:05,589 --> 00:15:07,755
newspapers or the internet
or watch television...

238
00:15:07,855 --> 00:15:09,760
How you met the defendant?

239
00:15:11,450 --> 00:15:15,560
On september 22, 2004, Kate...

240
00:15:17,260 --> 00:15:21,805
Miss Austen and I were both
passengers on Oceanic flight 815,

241
00:15:21,905 --> 00:15:24,335
which crash-landed on an
island in the south pacific.

242
00:15:24,435 --> 00:15:27,515
Were you aware that miss Austen
was a fugitive being transported

243
00:15:27,615 --> 00:15:31,225
by a United States marshal on that
flight to Los Angeles for trial?

244
00:15:31,325 --> 00:15:32,935
I did learn that eventually, yes.

245
00:15:33,035 --> 00:15:34,665
From the U.S. marshal?

246
00:15:34,765 --> 00:15:37,630
No, the marshal died in the crash.

247
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:40,595
I never spoke to him.

248
00:15:40,695 --> 00:15:43,080
Miss Austen told me.

249
00:15:46,130 --> 00:15:48,165
Did you ever ask her if she was guilty?

250
00:15:48,265 --> 00:15:49,935
No. Never.

251
00:15:50,035 --> 00:15:53,270
Well, it seems like a
reasonable question. Why not?

252
00:15:53,710 --> 00:15:56,605
I just assumed that there'd
been some kind of mistake.

253
00:15:56,705 --> 00:15:59,280
And why would you think that?

254
00:16:00,790 --> 00:16:02,715
Only eight of us survived the crash.

255
00:16:02,815 --> 00:16:04,840
We landed in the water.

256
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:07,415
I was hurt pretty badly.

257
00:16:07,515 --> 00:16:12,175
In fact, if it weren't for her,
I would have never made it to the shore.

258
00:16:12,275 --> 00:16:13,365
She took care of me.

259
00:16:13,465 --> 00:16:15,115
She took care of
all of us. She--

260
00:16:15,215 --> 00:16:20,945
She gave us first
aid, water, found food, made shelter.

261
00:16:21,045 --> 00:16:23,950
- She tried to save the other two, but they didn't--
- Stop.

262
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:26,645
Miss Austen, please sit down.

263
00:16:26,745 --> 00:16:30,930
This has nothing to do
with... with anything.

264
00:16:33,090 --> 00:16:35,875
This is my trial, and I don't
want him to say anything else.

265
00:16:35,975 --> 00:16:38,730
It's fine. I have no
more questions, your honor.

266
00:16:40,670 --> 00:16:44,120
Miss Dunbrook, your witness.

267
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:50,680
That was very moving, Dr. Shephard.

268
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:55,235
I only have one question for you:
Do you love the defendant?

269
00:16:55,335 --> 00:16:57,120
Objection.

270
00:16:57,420 --> 00:17:01,300
You opened this door, Mr.
Forrester. I'm going to allow it.

271
00:17:03,270 --> 00:17:05,740
Dr. Shephard?

272
00:17:06,390 --> 00:17:09,180
Do you love Miss Austen?

273
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:12,210
No.

274
00:17:13,820 --> 00:17:16,220
Not anymore.

275
00:17:24,580 --> 00:17:29,035
So... what do you want to watch--
'Xanadu' or 'Satan's Doom'?

276
00:17:29,135 --> 00:17:30,670
I'm reading.

277
00:17:34,090 --> 00:17:36,420
- Turn that thing down, damn it.
- Sorry.

278
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:47,720
Hey.

279
00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:49,690
Can I come in?

280
00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:54,055
Sure. I believe you know my roommate.

281
00:17:54,155 --> 00:17:56,280
- Hi, Hurley.
- Hey, Kate.

282
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:00,840
Got somethin' in your eye, Hugo?

283
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:04,320
Why don't we talk in the kitchen?

284
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:13,085
I know it's in a box, but, uh...

285
00:18:13,185 --> 00:18:15,065
it's pretty damn good wine.

286
00:18:15,165 --> 00:18:16,865
I tested it.

287
00:18:16,965 --> 00:18:19,885
So how's the life at Casa di Claire?

288
00:18:19,985 --> 00:18:22,105
Baby Aaron keeping you up all night?

289
00:18:22,205 --> 00:18:24,265
No. No, he's a good sleeper.

290
00:18:24,365 --> 00:18:26,400
Good for you.

291
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:36,495
You are terrible at this, freckles.

292
00:18:36,595 --> 00:18:37,415
Terrible at what?

293
00:18:37,515 --> 00:18:40,630
You already said you
didn't stay behind for me.

294
00:18:41,510 --> 00:18:46,140
So at least be woman enough to tell
me you wanna use me for somethin'.

295
00:18:48,890 --> 00:18:51,315
I wanna use you for somethin'.

296
00:18:51,415 --> 00:18:54,090
See? Wasn't that hard.

297
00:18:55,070 --> 00:18:56,615
For what?

298
00:18:56,715 --> 00:18:58,750
For Ben.

299
00:18:59,910 --> 00:19:02,590
I want you to help me bust him out.

300
00:19:07,170 --> 00:19:09,010
You wanna play backgammon?

301
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:11,020
You're on.

302
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:22,120
Do you think I know what I'm doing?

303
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:25,985
Do you...

304
00:19:26,085 --> 00:19:31,390
regret following me out here, or are you
worried about what we should do next?

305
00:19:33,010 --> 00:19:37,125
All I know is I'd be a lot more
worried if I was sitting on that beach.

306
00:19:37,225 --> 00:19:38,985
And the rest of the group,
what are they saying?

307
00:19:39,085 --> 00:19:41,730
I think they're saying, 'baa.'

308
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:44,795
That's the nice thing about sheep.

309
00:19:44,895 --> 00:19:46,910
They're predictable.

310
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:53,145
But I ain't so sure about Kate.

311
00:19:53,245 --> 00:19:55,430
What do you mean?

312
00:19:56,910 --> 00:20:00,245
I need your word you ain't
gonna do nothin' to her.

313
00:20:00,345 --> 00:20:03,550
- Why would I do anything to her?
- Just give me your word, John.

314
00:20:06,470 --> 00:20:07,855
You know what? Forget it.

315
00:20:07,955 --> 00:20:10,255
No, no. No. All right.

316
00:20:10,355 --> 00:20:12,600
You have my word.

317
00:20:14,150 --> 00:20:17,045
She came to me about an hour ago,

318
00:20:17,145 --> 00:20:20,980
said she wanted my help busting
Ben out of your basement.

319
00:20:21,930 --> 00:20:23,815
Why?

320
00:20:23,915 --> 00:20:26,180
She talked to that guy...

321
00:20:26,530 --> 00:20:29,825
Bruce Lee from the freighter--
the guy you got locked up.

322
00:20:29,925 --> 00:20:32,015
He told her to bring Ben
down to him for a chat.

323
00:20:32,115 --> 00:20:32,775
No, that's impossible.

324
00:20:32,875 --> 00:20:34,535
She doesn't even know where Miles is.

325
00:20:34,635 --> 00:20:37,755
What? The boathouse down by the dock?

326
00:20:37,855 --> 00:20:41,310
If Hugo knows, everybody knows.

327
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:44,785
Are you sure about this?

328
00:20:44,885 --> 00:20:47,150
Yeah, I'm sure.

329
00:20:50,150 --> 00:20:51,995
Where are you going with that?

330
00:20:52,095 --> 00:20:57,060
Whatever Miles has to say
to Ben, he can say to me.

331
00:21:14,050 --> 00:21:16,410
Son of a bitch.

332
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:34,330
Come on.

333
00:22:00,810 --> 00:22:03,660
You got one minute. Go.

334
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:06,135
How about some privacy?

335
00:22:06,235 --> 00:22:09,320
55 seconds.

336
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:12,645
You know who I am?

337
00:22:12,745 --> 00:22:14,120
Yes.

338
00:22:15,060 --> 00:22:16,815
You know who I work for?

339
00:22:16,915 --> 00:22:18,385
Yes.

340
00:22:18,485 --> 00:22:22,340
Then you know he's put a lot of
time and energy into finding you.

341
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:29,830
So now I found you, and I can
tell him exactly where you are.

342
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:35,875
Or I can lie and tell
him you were already dead.

343
00:22:35,975 --> 00:22:41,580
And I'd be willing to
do that for $3.2 million.

344
00:22:43,690 --> 00:22:47,545
You've arranged this meeting
so you could blackmail me?

345
00:22:47,645 --> 00:22:49,545
It's extortion, if you
wanna get technical.

346
00:22:49,645 --> 00:22:53,440
3.2? Well, why not 3.3 or 3.4?

347
00:22:57,130 --> 00:23:00,115
What makes you think I have
access to that kind of money?

348
00:23:00,215 --> 00:23:02,755
Do not treat me like I'm one of them,

349
00:23:02,855 --> 00:23:06,750
like I don't know who you
are and what you can do.

350
00:23:08,410 --> 00:23:10,235
Your friend Charlotte has
seen me. She knows I'm alive.

351
00:23:10,335 --> 00:23:11,855
I'll take care of Charlotte.

352
00:23:11,955 --> 00:23:13,865
You just worry about
getting me the money.

353
00:23:13,965 --> 00:23:15,285
You have two days.

354
00:23:15,385 --> 00:23:17,555
My present situation is
a little bit restricted.

355
00:23:17,655 --> 00:23:19,425
Can that be amended?

356
00:23:19,525 --> 00:23:21,180
Okay.

357
00:23:21,730 --> 00:23:23,965
- One week, in cash.
- Time's up.

358
00:23:24,065 --> 00:23:26,930
- Don't even think about--
- I said time's up!

359
00:23:30,830 --> 00:23:31,725
Ooh, this is hot.

360
00:23:31,825 --> 00:23:34,790
You got your meeting.
Now I want my answer.

361
00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:39,950
We got your name when
you called the freighter.

362
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:43,585
Of course, we know about you and
everybody else on the 815 manifest.

363
00:23:43,685 --> 00:23:45,115
Then prove it.

364
00:23:45,215 --> 00:23:47,075
Your name is Katherine Anne Austen.

365
00:23:47,175 --> 00:23:49,690
You're wanted for murder,
fraud, arson, a...

366
00:23:49,790 --> 00:23:52,305
whole bunch of other
stuff I can't remember.

367
00:23:52,405 --> 00:23:54,714
You're a fugitive, got caught in...

368
00:23:54,814 --> 00:23:57,730
Australia, and the feds
are bringing you back.

369
00:23:59,210 --> 00:24:01,550
So, yeah, we know.

370
00:24:03,250 --> 00:24:07,040
If I were you, I'd stay
right here on the island.

371
00:24:07,210 --> 00:24:09,665
Who knows? Maybe you
didn't survive the crash.

372
00:24:09,765 --> 00:24:11,460
Come on.

373
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:22,825
Go back to your house, Kate.

374
00:24:22,925 --> 00:24:24,235
John, this has nothing
to do with you--

375
00:24:24,335 --> 00:24:27,460
Go back to your house, Kate!

376
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:46,840
You okay?

377
00:24:47,810 --> 00:24:49,655
I couldn't sleep.

378
00:24:49,755 --> 00:24:52,810
Yeah. The beds take a
little getting used to.

379
00:24:53,260 --> 00:24:54,555
I didn't wake Aaron, did I?

380
00:24:54,655 --> 00:24:56,515
No, Aaron was born on this island.

381
00:24:56,615 --> 00:24:58,900
He can sleep through anything.

382
00:24:59,890 --> 00:25:01,850
John?

383
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:04,295
What are you doing?

384
00:25:04,395 --> 00:25:07,235
I'd like a... a moment alone with Kate.

385
00:25:07,335 --> 00:25:09,790
Would you excuse us, please, Claire?

386
00:25:11,350 --> 00:25:13,270
It's okay.

387
00:25:22,030 --> 00:25:26,390
Kate, I just need to know
what they said to each other.

388
00:25:28,690 --> 00:25:32,140
Miles told Ben that he would lie to
the people he works for on the boat,

389
00:25:32,730 --> 00:25:36,780
tell them that Ben was
dead, for $3.2 million.

390
00:25:40,730 --> 00:25:42,725
Listen, John, I'm sorry.

391
00:25:42,825 --> 00:25:44,295
I asked you where he was--

392
00:25:44,395 --> 00:25:47,300
You're not welcome here anymore.

393
00:25:47,890 --> 00:25:50,590
I want you gone by morning.

394
00:26:14,110 --> 00:26:16,305
I worked it out so you two can
have a few minutes of privacy.

395
00:26:16,405 --> 00:26:17,425
I don't need any privacy.

396
00:26:17,525 --> 00:26:19,250
You need to talk to her, Kate.

397
00:26:21,020 --> 00:26:22,700
I'll be outside.

398
00:26:31,430 --> 00:26:33,430
Hello, Katherine.

399
00:26:35,670 --> 00:26:38,700
Was it true, what he said?

400
00:26:40,460 --> 00:26:45,540
Dr. Shephard-- that you're a hero.

401
00:26:53,510 --> 00:26:54,915
Why won't you talk to me?

402
00:26:55,015 --> 00:26:57,475
Because, mom, the last time
I tried to talk to you,

403
00:26:57,575 --> 00:27:00,360
when you got sick, when I
risked my life to see you,

404
00:27:00,460 --> 00:27:02,440
you screamed for help
and called the police.

405
00:27:02,540 --> 00:27:03,840
Please.

406
00:27:06,590 --> 00:27:09,940
I don't want to fight
with you, Katherine.

407
00:27:10,540 --> 00:27:12,730
Why are you here?

408
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:18,900
Because...

409
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:22,090
I...

410
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:30,300
It all changed when I
thought you were dead.

411
00:27:36,380 --> 00:27:41,940
My doctors have given me six months
to live for the last four years.

412
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:45,680
I don't know how long I'm going to last.

413
00:27:45,890 --> 00:27:48,260
I came here to tell you that I...

414
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:53,320
I don't want to testify against you.

415
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:04,110
Then don't.

416
00:28:08,550 --> 00:28:11,620
I want to see my grandson.

417
00:28:18,020 --> 00:28:20,725
You came here to make a deal?

418
00:28:20,825 --> 00:28:23,180
I just wanna meet him.

419
00:28:24,330 --> 00:28:27,320
I don't want you anywhere near him.

420
00:28:31,060 --> 00:28:33,250
We're finished.

421
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:35,700
We're finished!

422
00:28:40,420 --> 00:28:42,870
Oh, hey, freckles.

423
00:28:48,670 --> 00:28:50,700
Are you okay?

424
00:28:55,010 --> 00:28:57,335
Look, I'm sorry I couldn't do nothin'.

425
00:28:57,435 --> 00:29:01,610
I wanted him to think
that you fooled me, too.

426
00:29:02,420 --> 00:29:06,470
No sense in him not trusting both of us.

427
00:29:07,550 --> 00:29:10,770
He wants me gone by tomorrow.

428
00:29:10,870 --> 00:29:14,530
What, he... banished you?

429
00:29:14,980 --> 00:29:18,320
Well, I un-banish you.

430
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:24,410
You can stay right...here.

431
00:29:24,830 --> 00:29:27,720
This is my house.

432
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:35,530
Okay, me and Montezuma's house.

433
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:39,035
You're gonna be all right.

434
00:29:39,135 --> 00:29:41,580
I'll keep you safe.

435
00:30:03,650 --> 00:30:04,560
Time.

436
00:30:04,660 --> 00:30:05,615
Okay, tell me.

437
00:30:05,715 --> 00:30:07,410
What do you remember?

438
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:12,150
Okay, uh, queen of diamonds.

439
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:17,330
Then we... six... of... clubs.

440
00:30:17,430 --> 00:30:18,690
Sorry.

441
00:30:18,790 --> 00:30:27,650
And we have the red 10
of...hearts, maybe?

442
00:30:33,420 --> 00:30:36,125
It's two out of three.

443
00:30:36,225 --> 00:30:37,940
It's not bad.

444
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:39,340
It's progress.

445
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:42,275
Three cards, Charlotte.

446
00:30:42,375 --> 00:30:43,470
Is that progress?

447
00:30:43,570 --> 00:30:44,810
Hey.

448
00:30:46,970 --> 00:30:48,655
Been calling your boat all day.

449
00:30:48,755 --> 00:30:50,135
Why isn't anyone answering?

450
00:30:50,235 --> 00:30:52,160
We're here. How should we know?

451
00:30:52,260 --> 00:30:54,119
If they're not answering,
then they're probably--

452
00:30:54,219 --> 00:30:56,740
Now are you telling me there
is only one line on that boat?

453
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:03,640
There is another number that we're
only supposed to use in emergencies.

454
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:08,520
It's an emergency.

455
00:31:15,270 --> 00:31:17,660
Put it on speaker.

456
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:30,035
Yeah?

457
00:31:30,135 --> 00:31:31,490
Regina, it's Charlotte.

458
00:31:31,590 --> 00:31:33,325
Why are you calling me on this number?

459
00:31:33,425 --> 00:31:35,715
Minkowski wasn't answering.

460
00:31:35,815 --> 00:31:37,633
The people on the island
want to talk to...

461
00:31:37,733 --> 00:31:39,550
their friends, make
sure they're all right.

462
00:31:39,650 --> 00:31:42,600
What... friends?

463
00:31:43,190 --> 00:31:45,185
They left last night.

464
00:31:45,285 --> 00:31:47,290
Frank took 'em up in the helicopter.

465
00:31:47,390 --> 00:31:49,200
What do you mean, they took off?

466
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:52,220
I thought the helicopter was with you.

467
00:32:08,380 --> 00:32:09,900
Morning.

468
00:32:14,150 --> 00:32:17,945
Listen, I don't know what
you think you're doing,

469
00:32:18,045 --> 00:32:20,305
- but you're wasting your time.
- Open your mouth.

470
00:32:20,405 --> 00:32:21,760
Open your mouth.

471
00:32:21,860 --> 00:32:23,150
Wide.

472
00:32:23,860 --> 00:32:26,900
Don't talk. Bite down. Bite down.

473
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:30,130
I realize that when I tied
you up in here the other day,

474
00:32:30,230 --> 00:32:32,610
I made the mistake of
failing to introduce myself.

475
00:32:32,710 --> 00:32:35,460
My name is John Locke,
and I'm responsible...

476
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:37,625
for the well-being of this island.

477
00:32:37,725 --> 00:32:39,895
Eventually, Miles, you're
gonna tell me who you are

478
00:32:39,995 --> 00:32:42,035
and you're gonna tell me
about the people on the boat

479
00:32:42,135 --> 00:32:45,370
and you're gonna tell me why
you're so interested in Ben.

480
00:32:45,470 --> 00:32:49,600
In the meantime, however, you're
gonna keep your mouth shut.

481
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:54,105
I learned something yesterday.

482
00:32:54,205 --> 00:32:57,730
No use having rules if there's no
punishment for breaking them.

483
00:32:58,510 --> 00:33:01,530
You'll be fine if you
bite down on the trigger.

484
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:04,900
Enjoy your breakfast.

485
00:33:37,130 --> 00:33:39,260
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

486
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:40,390
Just--slow down. Slow.

487
00:33:40,490 --> 00:33:41,670
Oh, Come on.

488
00:33:41,770 --> 00:33:45,130
It's not like we ain't
never done it before.

489
00:33:45,860 --> 00:33:48,385
Yeah, I'm cool we didn't
go all the way last night.

490
00:33:48,485 --> 00:33:49,740
I get it.

491
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:51,865
You were sad.

492
00:33:51,965 --> 00:33:57,915
But, I mean, how can you resist after
that whole,'I'll keep you safe' thing?

493
00:33:58,015 --> 00:34:00,580
No. Sawyer... just...

494
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:02,510
What?

495
00:34:03,180 --> 00:34:03,640
What? What'd I say?

496
00:34:03,740 --> 00:34:07,090
Just... forget it.

497
00:34:07,190 --> 00:34:09,245
Oh, right.

498
00:34:09,345 --> 00:34:13,640
You still think you might be pregnant.

499
00:34:13,810 --> 00:34:16,460
I'm not worried.

500
00:34:20,890 --> 00:34:24,080
And I'm not pregnant.

501
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:25,575
Are you sure?

502
00:34:25,675 --> 00:34:27,950
Yeah, I'm sure.

503
00:34:29,390 --> 00:34:32,140
I mean...whoo!

504
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:34,330
Would it have been the
worst thing in the world?

505
00:34:34,430 --> 00:34:38,440
Yes! Yes, it would've been
the worst thing in the world.

506
00:34:38,540 --> 00:34:41,370
What would we have done with a baby?

507
00:34:41,470 --> 00:34:43,205
I'm going back to the beach.

508
00:34:43,305 --> 00:34:44,335
Beach?

509
00:34:44,435 --> 00:34:46,370
What, you're leavin' because of this?

510
00:34:46,470 --> 00:34:47,705
That's that?

511
00:34:47,805 --> 00:34:49,695
You crawl up in my bed one
second, the next, you're just--

512
00:34:49,795 --> 00:34:52,040
Good-bye, James.

513
00:34:53,140 --> 00:34:54,895
Don't make this about me, Kate.

514
00:34:54,995 --> 00:34:57,950
You didn't want a baby
any more than I did.

515
00:34:58,050 --> 00:35:02,710
You're just lookin' for some excuse
to split, and now you got one.

516
00:35:03,010 --> 00:35:04,045
Well, that's all right, freckles.

517
00:35:04,145 --> 00:35:06,515
I ain't gonna hold it against you.

518
00:35:06,615 --> 00:35:09,555
I'm just gonna sit right
here in my comfy bed,

519
00:35:09,655 --> 00:35:11,170
because in about a week,

520
00:35:11,270 --> 00:35:15,280
you'll find some reason to get pissed
at Jack and bounce right back to me.

521
00:35:45,050 --> 00:35:47,300
Miss Dunbrook.

522
00:35:47,490 --> 00:35:50,910
Are the people ready to proceed?

523
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:53,390
May we approach the bench, your honor?

524
00:35:53,490 --> 00:35:55,310
Please.

525
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:03,300
Unfortunately, your honor, our
chief witness, Diane Jansen,

526
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:08,080
the mother of the defendant, is unable
to testify because of medical reasons.

527
00:36:08,180 --> 00:36:10,420
How long will you need?

528
00:36:11,180 --> 00:36:12,530
I can't say right now.

529
00:36:12,630 --> 00:36:14,040
What I'll do is grant
a recess for lunch,

530
00:36:14,140 --> 00:36:18,390
but be prepared to proceed with
your case after we return.

531
00:36:18,490 --> 00:36:21,105
This court is now in recess.

532
00:36:21,205 --> 00:36:23,220
All rise.

533
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:27,130
We have to talk.

534
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:34,740
My key witness spoke to her daughter
yesterday, and now she's got cold feet.

535
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:36,930
Quit posturing, and let's get to it.

536
00:36:37,030 --> 00:36:39,030
What are you offering?

537
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:42,340
Four years in.

538
00:36:44,430 --> 00:36:45,855
No jail time.

539
00:36:45,955 --> 00:36:48,103
Kate Austen is a worldwide
hero who saved...

540
00:36:48,203 --> 00:36:50,400
five other peoples'
lives after a plane crash

541
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:52,340
and nearly starved to
death on a deserted island,

542
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:55,581
and after all that, you
put this woman on trial...

543
00:36:55,681 --> 00:36:58,695
for rescuing her mother
from an abusive husband.

544
00:36:58,795 --> 00:37:04,045
If you think that jury is gonna
give her actual time, then...

545
00:37:04,145 --> 00:37:07,440
you must have a hell
of a closing, Melissa.

546
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:11,790
All right.

547
00:37:12,260 --> 00:37:14,343
Time served, plus 10
years' probation and...

548
00:37:14,443 --> 00:37:16,525
agreement that she does
not leave the state.

549
00:37:16,625 --> 00:37:18,175
What does that matter?

550
00:37:18,275 --> 00:37:20,210
- She can go anyw--
- I'll take it.

551
00:37:20,310 --> 00:37:21,070
No. Wait, Kate--

552
00:37:21,170 --> 00:37:23,300
Give me something to
sign, and I'll sign it,

553
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:25,860
and then I walk out the back door.

554
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:27,650
I just...

555
00:37:30,210 --> 00:37:33,620
I just want this to be over.

556
00:37:34,340 --> 00:37:35,930
I can do that.

557
00:37:36,030 --> 00:37:40,550
10 years' probation, and you stay put.

558
00:37:41,140 --> 00:37:43,640
I have a child.

559
00:37:43,820 --> 00:37:46,560
I'm not going anywhere.

560
00:38:00,020 --> 00:38:01,890
Hey.

561
00:38:06,170 --> 00:38:08,655
How did you know I'd be here?

562
00:38:08,755 --> 00:38:14,090
Uh, your...your lawyer
gave me the heads-up.

563
00:38:14,770 --> 00:38:17,030
He owed me one.

564
00:38:17,130 --> 00:38:22,570
Thank you... for saying what you did.

565
00:38:22,670 --> 00:38:24,910
You're welcome.

566
00:38:25,010 --> 00:38:28,485
You know, Jack, I've heard you
say that story so many times,

567
00:38:28,585 --> 00:38:31,660
I'm starting to think you believe it.

568
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:40,500
I just-- I just wanted to tell
you that what I said in there...

569
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:45,980
I didn't mean it.

570
00:38:51,290 --> 00:38:53,445
You wanna follow me?

571
00:38:53,545 --> 00:38:55,940
Come by for a visit?

572
00:38:58,020 --> 00:39:01,980
I... I actually have to
get over to the hospital,

573
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:08,790
but, um, maybe you and I could grab
some coffee together or something?

574
00:39:13,290 --> 00:39:17,570
I know why you don't
wanna see the baby, Jack.

575
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:23,970
But until you do, until you want to...

576
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:30,080
there's no...you and me going for coffee.

577
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:32,820
But, um...

578
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:37,280
if at any time you change
your mind, come and see us.

579
00:39:37,380 --> 00:39:41,840
Yeah. Okay.

580
00:39:51,630 --> 00:39:53,020
Bye.

581
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:54,630
Bye.

582
00:40:38,370 --> 00:40:40,090
Hello?

583
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:41,615
Kate!

584
00:40:41,715 --> 00:40:44,170
I'm so glad you're back.

585
00:40:46,580 --> 00:40:48,265
He missed you so much.

586
00:40:48,365 --> 00:40:49,920
Did you keep him away from the tv?

587
00:40:50,020 --> 00:40:52,175
Absolutely.

588
00:40:52,275 --> 00:40:55,170
I just put him down for a nap.

589
00:41:17,460 --> 00:41:19,460
Hey, buddy.

590
00:41:19,700 --> 00:41:22,060
Hey.

591
00:41:28,380 --> 00:41:30,340
Hey.

592
00:41:31,860 --> 00:41:34,280
Hi, mommy.

593
00:41:36,700 --> 00:41:39,330
Hi, Aaron.
