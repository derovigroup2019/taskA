00:00:02,322 --> 00:00:04,196
<i>Previously on Lost:</i>

2
00:00:04,241 --> 00:00:06,032
- Who are you?
- Daniel Faraday.

3
00:00:06,076 --> 00:00:07,487
I'm here to rescue you.

4
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:12,367
I just almost died
jumping out of a helicopter

5
00:00:12,416 --> 00:00:15,085
- because you called us for help.
- She's lying.

6
00:00:15,127 --> 00:00:17,203
Whatever they came for, it isn't us.

7
00:00:17,254 --> 00:00:19,377
Is that from your chopper?

8
00:00:19,464 --> 00:00:23,047
Yeah. That...
Yeah, they reduce the weight load.

9
00:00:23,093 --> 00:00:25,299
What's this for?

10
00:00:25,345 --> 00:00:27,255
Rescuing you and your people...

11
00:00:27,306 --> 00:00:30,556
...I can't really say
it's our primary objective.

12
00:00:30,601 --> 00:00:32,392
Then what is?

13
00:00:54,708 --> 00:00:57,033
Hello. I'm sorry I'm late.

14
00:00:57,085 --> 00:00:59,374
- You must be Dr Burke.
- Juliet.

15
00:00:59,463 --> 00:01:02,380
Juliet. I'm Harper Stanhope.

16
00:01:02,424 --> 00:01:04,583
Please sit.

17
00:01:06,595 --> 00:01:08,422
Today is just a meet and greet

18
00:01:08,472 --> 00:01:10,511
so that we can get to know each other.

19
00:01:10,557 --> 00:01:14,721
Please don't take this the wrong way,
but I really don't think I need therapy.

20
00:01:16,313 --> 00:01:19,231
How about we call it "talking"
instead of therapy?

21
00:01:21,610 --> 00:01:23,152
- OK.
- Good.

22
00:01:23,195 --> 00:01:25,353
Let's talk.

23
00:01:26,073 --> 00:01:28,362
So you've been here a week...

24
00:01:29,243 --> 00:01:32,197
...and what's
your least favourite part so far?

25
00:01:32,996 --> 00:01:35,570
I don't like being treated
like a celebrity.

26
00:01:35,666 --> 00:01:37,658
And is that surprising?

27
00:01:37,751 --> 00:01:41,416
- You're big news right now.
- Yes, I know.

28
00:01:42,965 --> 00:01:45,835
I guess I don't like being
the centre of attention.

29
00:01:46,969 --> 00:01:48,842
It makes me feel isolated.

30
00:01:50,764 --> 00:01:52,045
Alone.

31
00:01:55,018 --> 00:01:58,767
Well, maybe you feel
that all eyes are on you...

32
00:01:59,606 --> 00:02:01,813
...but you're not a celebrity.

33
00:02:01,859 --> 00:02:06,070
And soon enough you'll realise that
you're no different than anyone here.

34
00:02:06,113 --> 00:02:09,778
- I know. I never meant that I...
- Yes?

35
00:02:09,867 --> 00:02:12,192
Harper, I'm sorry for the interruption.

36
00:02:12,244 --> 00:02:16,194
I know you don't like me busting in,
but Ben would like to see the doc.

37
00:02:19,084 --> 00:02:21,041
She's all yours, Tom.

38
00:02:23,755 --> 00:02:26,329
It was nice talking to you, Juliet.

39
00:02:26,425 --> 00:02:28,501
Welcome to the island.

40
00:02:31,722 --> 00:02:33,513
Harper's a real piece of work.

41
00:02:33,557 --> 00:02:37,305
But if you give her a week, she'll
have you crying about your daddy.

42
00:02:37,352 --> 00:02:40,104
I'm speaking
from personal experience here.

43
00:02:44,568 --> 00:02:46,774
Welcome to your humble abode.

44
00:02:48,530 --> 00:02:50,024
This is for me?

45
00:02:50,741 --> 00:02:52,283
The whole house?

46
00:02:52,326 --> 00:02:56,074
You're here to help us with some
very important research, Juliet.

47
00:02:56,121 --> 00:02:58,244
We pulled out all the stops.

48
00:03:00,083 --> 00:03:02,456
Two bedrooms, two baths,
washer, dryer.

49
00:03:03,295 --> 00:03:06,166
Fresh linens, a well-stocked fridge.

50
00:03:06,256 --> 00:03:09,921
And I know you love the opera.
We have all the classics on CD.

51
00:03:11,345 --> 00:03:13,053
Ben, this is amazing.

52
00:03:13,096 --> 00:03:16,216
Seriously, you shouldn't have gone
to all the trouble.

53
00:03:16,266 --> 00:03:18,389
I'm only gonna be here for six months.

54
00:03:18,435 --> 00:03:19,977
Right, of course, but...

55
00:03:22,064 --> 00:03:24,103
...we want you to feel at home.

56
00:03:32,157 --> 00:03:34,233
Need some help?

57
00:03:34,284 --> 00:03:37,618
I'm fine. I just can't seem
to get it steady.

58
00:03:39,414 --> 00:03:41,074
OK.

59
00:03:41,875 --> 00:03:43,832
Nice. Thanks.

60
00:03:44,628 --> 00:03:48,922
Why are you going to all this trouble
when we're about to leave this island?

61
00:03:48,966 --> 00:03:51,373
We still need somewhere
to sleep tonight.

62
00:03:51,426 --> 00:03:54,546
Juliet, have you seen
Charlotte and Faraday?

63
00:03:54,596 --> 00:03:56,922
- All their stuff's gone.
- No, I haven't.

64
00:03:57,015 --> 00:03:59,471
You have the sat-phone, right?

65
00:04:01,270 --> 00:04:03,642
He saw them going into the jungle.

66
00:04:06,316 --> 00:04:08,309
Why didn't he say anything?

67
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:14,782
You said they are friends.

68
00:04:19,121 --> 00:04:20,449
Aren't they?

69
00:04:22,541 --> 00:04:26,040
We got a lot of ground to cover,
so let's fan out.

70
00:04:26,086 --> 00:04:29,870
If you cut their trail,
call out to me, I'll come to you.

71
00:05:07,377 --> 00:05:09,251
Jack?

72
00:05:11,048 --> 00:05:13,206
Hello, Juliet.

73
00:05:13,258 --> 00:05:15,132
Long time, no see.

74
00:05:38,492 --> 00:05:40,034
What are you doing here?

75
00:05:40,077 --> 00:05:43,991
I came to deliver a message...
from Ben.

76
00:05:44,706 --> 00:05:48,206
The two people you're looking for,
Faraday and Lewis,

77
00:05:48,252 --> 00:05:50,161
they're headed to the Tempest.

78
00:05:50,712 --> 00:05:53,417
And if they figure out
how to deploy that gas...

79
00:05:54,341 --> 00:05:58,670
...then everyone on this island
is going to die.

80
00:06:01,056 --> 00:06:04,306
- Why don't you stop them?
- Because Ben wants you to go.

81
00:06:04,351 --> 00:06:07,850
How can Ben know where they are
when he's a prisoner?

82
00:06:07,896 --> 00:06:10,601
Ben is exactly where he wants to be.

83
00:06:18,365 --> 00:06:21,615
- How am I supposed to stop them?
- By pointing the gun

84
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:24,233
and pulling the trigger.

85
00:06:24,288 --> 00:06:25,450
Hey!

86
00:06:28,041 --> 00:06:30,200
Who are you?

87
00:06:31,461 --> 00:06:33,501
I'm an old friend of Juliet's.

88
00:06:35,174 --> 00:06:38,756
I just told her where the people
you're looking for are headed.

89
00:06:38,802 --> 00:06:41,293
Maybe you and your gun can go too.

90
00:07:25,724 --> 00:07:27,432
You OK?

91
00:07:29,061 --> 00:07:33,011
I was just looking for some gauze.
I didn't know anyone was here.

92
00:07:39,279 --> 00:07:41,189
How'd you manage that?

93
00:07:41,281 --> 00:07:44,816
I... I work over at the power station.

94
00:07:44,868 --> 00:07:47,157
I pressed up against a transformer.

95
00:07:48,831 --> 00:07:51,286
Take a seat.
Let me take a look at it.

96
00:07:59,842 --> 00:08:01,751
You're Burke, right?

97
00:08:02,427 --> 00:08:03,838
The baby doctor.

98
00:08:06,098 --> 00:08:08,174
What gave me away?

99
00:08:10,811 --> 00:08:13,136
I heard we lost Henrietta this morning.

100
00:08:15,482 --> 00:08:17,356
It's OK. It's not your fault.

101
00:08:17,401 --> 00:08:19,856
Pregnant women
are dying on this island.

102
00:08:21,697 --> 00:08:24,152
I was brought here to help fix that.

103
00:08:25,534 --> 00:08:27,491
So whose fault is it?

104
00:08:28,328 --> 00:08:32,112
Believe me, no one expects you
to fix it overnight.

105
00:08:36,753 --> 00:08:39,624
You have anyone to talk to?
Any friends here?

106
00:08:42,801 --> 00:08:45,886
- Maybe Harper.
- Harper hates me.

107
00:08:45,929 --> 00:08:48,171
We only talk because we have to.

108
00:08:48,223 --> 00:08:52,636
I get the feeling that she's a mean
and spiteful person.

109
00:08:55,606 --> 00:08:57,645
She's my wife.

110
00:08:59,401 --> 00:09:00,860
She's your wife?

111
00:09:03,405 --> 00:09:06,904
- I'm sorry.
- No, don't worry about it. It's OK.

112
00:09:06,950 --> 00:09:09,276
OK, you're... you're set.

113
00:09:11,914 --> 00:09:13,657
Much obliged, ma'am.

114
00:09:16,835 --> 00:09:20,500
Hey, I know this place can wear on you,

115
00:09:20,547 --> 00:09:22,421
but if you need to talk...

116
00:09:23,634 --> 00:09:25,342
...I'm around.

117
00:09:25,385 --> 00:09:26,630
Good to know.

118
00:09:27,554 --> 00:09:33,260
Oh, if you promise not to tell your wife
what I said about her...

119
00:09:34,102 --> 00:09:37,803
...I won't tell anyone you lied
about how you hurt your arm.

120
00:09:40,234 --> 00:09:42,938
I know a chemical burn when I see one.

121
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:50,109
You got a deal.

122
00:09:54,289 --> 00:09:56,365
By the way...

123
00:09:58,293 --> 00:09:59,953
...I'm Goodwin.

124
00:10:00,587 --> 00:10:02,295
Juliet.

125
00:10:12,683 --> 00:10:15,684
Faraday and Charlotte
are heading for the Tempest.

126
00:10:15,727 --> 00:10:18,978
- The Tempest?
- It's safer if I don't talk about it.

127
00:10:19,022 --> 00:10:20,647
No, talk about it, please.

128
00:10:20,691 --> 00:10:23,608
It's an electrical station
that powers the island.

129
00:10:23,652 --> 00:10:25,561
Why would they go there?

130
00:10:28,824 --> 00:10:31,493
If there's something
you need to tell me...

131
00:10:31,535 --> 00:10:33,326
...now's the time to do it.

132
00:10:35,873 --> 00:10:37,996
What I need is for you to help me.

133
00:10:38,083 --> 00:10:39,827
Will you help me?

134
00:10:46,884 --> 00:10:50,549
If we move all night,
maybe we can still catch them.

135
00:10:54,558 --> 00:10:55,637
Thank you.

136
00:11:05,736 --> 00:11:07,775
I think it's that way.

137
00:11:11,992 --> 00:11:14,779
What happens if I...

138
00:11:16,955 --> 00:11:18,865
What if I can't do it?

139
00:11:20,125 --> 00:11:21,667
Dan.

140
00:11:22,586 --> 00:11:24,080
Look at me.

141
00:11:26,048 --> 00:11:28,717
I know you can do this.

142
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:33,428
We should get going.

143
00:11:36,517 --> 00:11:38,225
Yeah.

144
00:11:38,727 --> 00:11:40,056
Come on.

145
00:11:44,191 --> 00:11:46,599
It's OK. It's OK. It's Kate.

146
00:11:57,079 --> 00:11:58,454
So they have Miles?

147
00:12:00,123 --> 00:12:03,457
Yeah, but he's fine.
They're treating him fine.

148
00:12:04,044 --> 00:12:06,582
I thought you two
were with Jack at the beach.

149
00:12:08,382 --> 00:12:10,374
What are you guys doing out here?

150
00:12:11,677 --> 00:12:14,927
Jack was trying to communicate
with Sayid and Desmond,

151
00:12:14,972 --> 00:12:17,926
but the sat-phone ran out ofjuice.

152
00:12:17,975 --> 00:12:21,426
It's totally dead.
There's no way we can call the boat.

153
00:12:22,271 --> 00:12:26,897
So we volunteered to get spare batteries
out the packs we threw out the chopper.

154
00:12:28,610 --> 00:12:32,655
So if you threw your pack
from the chopper,

155
00:12:32,698 --> 00:12:33,777
what's that?

156
00:12:35,659 --> 00:12:39,324
This... I just borrowed this.

157
00:12:41,206 --> 00:12:43,282
Mind if I take a look?

158
00:12:46,712 --> 00:12:48,372
Go ahead, Dan, show her.

159
00:12:56,930 --> 00:12:58,045
Batteries, huh?

160
00:12:58,140 --> 00:12:59,931
What's this?

161
00:13:04,313 --> 00:13:05,558
What?

162
00:13:12,821 --> 00:13:15,443
- That woman, what was her name?
- Harper.

163
00:13:16,283 --> 00:13:19,533
- The two of you friends?
- Not exactly.

164
00:13:19,578 --> 00:13:22,947
- She was my therapist.
- You people had therapists?

165
00:13:22,998 --> 00:13:26,449
It's very stressful
being an Other, Jack.

166
00:13:28,670 --> 00:13:32,834
- Seemed hostile, even for a therapist.
- There are things from your past

167
00:13:32,883 --> 00:13:37,094
- you'd rather not talk about.
- Yeah. You read them all in my file.

168
00:13:38,555 --> 00:13:41,225
Trust me, Jack,
you don't want to see my file.

169
00:13:45,813 --> 00:13:49,182
The problem occurs somewhere
during the second trimester

170
00:13:49,233 --> 00:13:51,902
when the mother's immune system
is triggered.

171
00:13:51,944 --> 00:13:54,269
The white blood cell count plummets.

172
00:13:54,363 --> 00:13:58,230
It's like the immune system
turns on the foetus.

173
00:13:59,785 --> 00:14:01,612
- May I?
- Sure.

174
00:14:08,210 --> 00:14:11,958
- Any thought yet on a cause?
- It's really too early to tell,

175
00:14:12,005 --> 00:14:16,418
but only women who have conceived
on the island does it happen to which...

176
00:14:16,468 --> 00:14:18,295
Hey, Juliet.

177
00:14:21,473 --> 00:14:23,347
Ben, I didn't know you were here.

178
00:14:24,893 --> 00:14:28,096
Ethan's out sick.
I have an extra egg salad on rye.

179
00:14:28,147 --> 00:14:30,554
I was just checking if Juliet wants it.

180
00:14:30,607 --> 00:14:32,399
Thanks. I already ate.

181
00:14:32,442 --> 00:14:35,360
I have an appointment
with your wife in ten minutes.

182
00:14:35,404 --> 00:14:38,109
Great. Tell her I said hi.

183
00:14:39,324 --> 00:14:41,032
Oh, will do.

184
00:14:42,286 --> 00:14:44,741
- Ben?
- No, I'm fine.

185
00:14:59,761 --> 00:15:03,344
So, Juliet, what do you think of Ben?

186
00:15:05,476 --> 00:15:07,552
He's great.

187
00:15:08,395 --> 00:15:11,349
Very smart and intense.

188
00:15:11,398 --> 00:15:13,474
Challenging.

189
00:15:14,151 --> 00:15:17,021
- He's been really good to me.
- Of course he has.

190
00:15:17,070 --> 00:15:19,110
You look just like her.

191
00:15:20,157 --> 00:15:21,402
I'm sorry?

192
00:15:21,450 --> 00:15:24,155
I see you and my husband
have become friendly.

193
00:15:28,123 --> 00:15:30,994
Yeah. He's great.

194
00:15:31,877 --> 00:15:34,000
He's been really helpful.

195
00:15:37,174 --> 00:15:39,879
When did you start sleeping with him?

196
00:15:41,178 --> 00:15:42,921
What?

197
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:48,340
Look, Juliet, I'm not an idiot,
so just tell me.

198
00:15:48,435 --> 00:15:50,392
When did it start?

199
00:15:52,231 --> 00:15:55,516
OK, I'm not doing this. We're done.

200
00:15:55,567 --> 00:15:58,604
No, please respect me enough
to spare me the pretence

201
00:15:58,695 --> 00:16:00,818
that you are actually offended.

202
00:16:00,864 --> 00:16:04,233
I know. I followed you.

203
00:16:07,204 --> 00:16:09,446
Watched you.

204
00:16:17,047 --> 00:16:19,538
- I'm sorry.
- It doesn't matter anymore.

205
00:16:19,591 --> 00:16:21,465
But what does matter

206
00:16:21,552 --> 00:16:24,837
is that you listen to me
and that you believe me.

207
00:16:27,766 --> 00:16:32,927
Now if you continue to have
a relationship with Goodwin...

208
00:16:34,022 --> 00:16:36,062
...there will be consequences.

209
00:16:37,943 --> 00:16:42,023
- I don't want him to get hurt.
- I would never hurt him.

210
00:16:42,072 --> 00:16:44,195
I am not talking about you.

211
00:16:44,241 --> 00:16:47,028
I am talking about Ben.

212
00:16:54,459 --> 00:16:56,701
Hi, John.

213
00:16:56,795 --> 00:16:58,503
Hey, Claire.

214
00:17:02,134 --> 00:17:04,126
Is there something I can do for you?

215
00:17:04,178 --> 00:17:06,550
I want to know
what's going on with Miles.

216
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:08,423
Right now not a whole lot.

217
00:17:08,474 --> 00:17:12,767
I'm bringing him food and water
until he decides to talk.

218
00:17:14,271 --> 00:17:16,809
I'd like to talk to him myself.

219
00:17:17,733 --> 00:17:19,560
Why would you want to do that?

220
00:17:19,610 --> 00:17:22,231
John, we have to find out
who these people are

221
00:17:22,279 --> 00:17:26,359
and where they came from... and why
they're not interested in rescuing us.

222
00:17:26,408 --> 00:17:29,362
- You don't think I'll get that?
- No, I...

223
00:17:31,079 --> 00:17:34,080
I just think we might be
taking the wrong approach.

224
00:17:34,124 --> 00:17:37,374
I mean, you killed one,
Ben shot one.

225
00:17:37,461 --> 00:17:39,703
Now we're holding one prisoner.

226
00:17:39,796 --> 00:17:43,960
You know, it's not hard to understand
why they might think we're hostile.

227
00:17:46,261 --> 00:17:48,752
I might be just
a little less intimidating.

228
00:17:50,682 --> 00:17:53,055
- It's not going to happen, Claire.
- John.

229
00:17:53,143 --> 00:17:56,097
You do remember what Charlie said
about these people.

230
00:17:56,188 --> 00:17:58,975
All Charlie said
was whose boat it isn't.

231
00:18:00,442 --> 00:18:03,858
Don't you want to know whose boat it is?

232
00:18:24,716 --> 00:18:28,216
- Rabbit today?
- We're running out of chickens.

233
00:18:31,473 --> 00:18:34,474
This didn't have a number on it, did it?

234
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:36,599
What?

235
00:18:36,645 --> 00:18:39,599
Eat, change. Put your laundry
and dishes by the door.

236
00:18:39,648 --> 00:18:42,020
I'll be back to collect them
in 15 minutes.

237
00:18:42,067 --> 00:18:44,688
So has the revolution begun yet?

238
00:18:50,576 --> 00:18:52,319
What are you talking about?

239
00:18:53,745 --> 00:18:57,079
Well, you're the leader now.
I know it's a tough position.

240
00:18:57,416 --> 00:19:01,366
You have to deal with all those people
second-guessing decisions.

241
00:19:01,420 --> 00:19:04,255
It starts out so innocently, doesn't it?

242
00:19:04,298 --> 00:19:08,461
A question here, a comment there.
And then if you're not careful,

243
00:19:08,552 --> 00:19:11,968
you find you have a full-blown
insurrection on your hands.

244
00:19:12,014 --> 00:19:16,094
Believe me, your people
are gonna be so angry

245
00:19:16,143 --> 00:19:19,512
when they realise
you still don't have a plan.

246
00:19:21,899 --> 00:19:23,856
And I assume you have a plan.

247
00:19:24,735 --> 00:19:26,644
I always have a plan.

248
00:19:26,695 --> 00:19:30,064
Does it involve
you raising $3.2 million?

249
00:19:33,368 --> 00:19:35,160
That's a lot of money.

250
00:19:36,163 --> 00:19:37,622
Wait.

251
00:19:38,999 --> 00:19:41,122
Maybe this will get you started.

252
00:19:43,670 --> 00:19:45,912
Put your laundry and dishes
by the door.

253
00:19:47,716 --> 00:19:50,966
I can help you, John.
We have shared interests.

254
00:19:52,095 --> 00:19:55,547
- Or at least a common enemy.
- Our friends on the freighter.

255
00:19:55,599 --> 00:19:59,348
Not them. The one they work for.

256
00:20:01,814 --> 00:20:04,020
Let me out of here.

257
00:20:04,399 --> 00:20:07,650
Give me some semblance of freedom.
Let me sleep in a bed,

258
00:20:07,736 --> 00:20:09,978
eat with utensils,
and I give you my word

259
00:20:10,030 --> 00:20:13,316
- I'll tell you everything...
- See, there's the problem.

260
00:20:13,367 --> 00:20:15,194
I don't trust your word.

261
00:20:16,787 --> 00:20:18,115
All right, then.

262
00:20:23,752 --> 00:20:27,038
I guess I'll have to show you.

263
00:20:43,856 --> 00:20:46,062
I hope this is good.

264
00:20:46,150 --> 00:20:49,234
I don't know much about wine.
I swiped this off the sub.

265
00:20:56,076 --> 00:20:57,654
There.

266
00:20:57,703 --> 00:20:59,327
Thanks.

267
00:21:07,921 --> 00:21:10,044
I wish we could do this all the time.

268
00:21:11,675 --> 00:21:15,459
I hate that we have to be so... private.

269
00:21:16,221 --> 00:21:19,008
What's the matter with being private?

270
00:21:19,057 --> 00:21:23,351
It's ridiculous. I've been sleeping
on the couch for a year.

271
00:21:23,395 --> 00:21:25,601
Why am I notjust telling her?

272
00:21:27,065 --> 00:21:29,391
I don't think it's a good idea.

273
00:21:36,742 --> 00:21:37,821
Why not?

274
00:21:40,287 --> 00:21:41,912
Ben wouldn't like it.

275
00:21:41,955 --> 00:21:44,992
That's what this is about?
You're worried about Ben?

276
00:21:46,835 --> 00:21:48,994
Why, because he has a crush on you?

277
00:21:50,964 --> 00:21:53,253
- You know?
- Come on, everyone knows.

278
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:55,458
He follows you around like a puppy.

279
00:21:56,845 --> 00:21:59,253
And you don't think that's a problem?

280
00:21:59,807 --> 00:22:04,053
A little less than a kilometre from here
he has me working with chemicals

281
00:22:04,102 --> 00:22:08,314
that could kill every man, woman
and child if I flipped the wrong switch.

282
00:22:09,608 --> 00:22:11,766
Trust me, Ben has enough on his plate.

283
00:22:11,860 --> 00:22:14,232
The last thing he cares about
is you and me.

284
00:22:15,030 --> 00:22:16,821
I just...

285
00:22:16,865 --> 00:22:19,356
...get the feeling
that he would be upset.

286
00:22:21,537 --> 00:22:23,410
What's Ben gonna do?

287
00:22:35,092 --> 00:22:37,049
Goodwin!

288
00:22:38,804 --> 00:22:41,840
- You see where the tail landed?
- Probably in the water.

289
00:22:41,890 --> 00:22:45,639
You can make that shore in an hour.
Ethan, get up to that fuselage.

290
00:22:45,727 --> 00:22:47,720
There may actually be survivors.

291
00:22:47,771 --> 00:22:50,938
And you're one of 'em.
A passenger. You're in shock.

292
00:22:50,983 --> 00:22:54,149
Come up with a story if they ask.
Stay quiet if they don't.

293
00:22:54,194 --> 00:22:58,773
Listen. Learn. Don't get involved.
I want lists in three days. Go.

294
00:23:18,093 --> 00:23:21,509
Something's wrong. We should've
caught up with them by now.

295
00:23:21,555 --> 00:23:24,224
These people base-jumped
out of a helicopter.

296
00:23:24,266 --> 00:23:26,674
Let's give them
the benefit of the doubt.

297
00:23:31,565 --> 00:23:33,937
Hey. Hey.

298
00:23:33,984 --> 00:23:36,060
It's OK. Hey. It's all right.

299
00:23:36,111 --> 00:23:37,392
It's OK.

300
00:23:37,446 --> 00:23:38,988
Hey.

301
00:23:40,657 --> 00:23:43,362
It's OK. You're all right. Come on.

302
00:23:44,328 --> 00:23:46,201
Take it easy.

303
00:23:46,246 --> 00:23:47,622
Take it easy.

304
00:23:50,626 --> 00:23:53,876
- I'll go get her some water.
- Yeah. Thanks.

305
00:23:58,801 --> 00:24:00,259
What happened?

306
00:24:02,346 --> 00:24:04,884
I was going back to the beach and...

307
00:24:05,557 --> 00:24:09,555
I ran into Faraday
and that woman... Charlotte.

308
00:24:09,645 --> 00:24:11,103
I think she hit me.

309
00:24:11,146 --> 00:24:14,515
They disappeared out of camp
last night. Trying to catch up.

310
00:24:17,277 --> 00:24:19,519
Do you know where they were headed?

311
00:24:19,571 --> 00:24:23,355
Some sort of... power station.

312
00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:25,404
Jack.

313
00:24:26,620 --> 00:24:28,613
They had gas masks.

314
00:24:33,377 --> 00:24:34,752
Juliet.

315
00:24:36,630 --> 00:24:38,208
Juliet!

316
00:24:45,722 --> 00:24:47,265
Juliet!

317
00:24:50,561 --> 00:24:52,019
Juliet!

318
00:25:00,529 --> 00:25:02,605
All right, no tricks.

319
00:25:03,991 --> 00:25:07,525
You're not leading me out
into the jungle so you can disappear

320
00:25:07,578 --> 00:25:10,247
or shoot me in the back.

321
00:25:10,289 --> 00:25:11,664
No tricks, John.

322
00:25:11,748 --> 00:25:14,286
We don't even have to leave
the living room.

323
00:25:16,170 --> 00:25:17,747
So let's have it.

324
00:25:19,173 --> 00:25:20,583
We have a deal, right?

325
00:25:21,758 --> 00:25:25,803
How do I know you won't run off and
meet your people first chance you get?

326
00:25:25,846 --> 00:25:30,591
If my people still wanted me they'd
have stormed this camp long ago.

327
00:25:34,605 --> 00:25:36,811
It's behind that picture.

328
00:25:50,287 --> 00:25:52,327
Thirty-six, 15, 28.

329
00:26:17,481 --> 00:26:19,023
"Red Sox"?

330
00:26:19,399 --> 00:26:21,558
I taped over the game.

331
00:26:49,555 --> 00:26:51,179
This is Charles Widmore.

332
00:26:53,767 --> 00:26:56,851
This is the man whose boat
is parked offshore.

333
00:27:00,107 --> 00:27:03,725
This is the man that's been trying
to find the island.

334
00:27:10,492 --> 00:27:12,319
Who's the man in the blindfold?

335
00:27:12,369 --> 00:27:15,536
One of my people that had
the misfortune to get caught.

336
00:27:15,581 --> 00:27:19,163
- How does Widmore know of the island?
- I don't know, but he does.

337
00:27:19,209 --> 00:27:21,831
What does he want?

338
00:27:21,879 --> 00:27:24,500
Three months ago
in Gainesville, Florida,

339
00:27:24,548 --> 00:27:27,465
the Virgin Mary seemed to appear
in a patch of mould

340
00:27:27,509 --> 00:27:29,668
on the side of an old housing complex.

341
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:34,761
When word got out, over 5,000 people
came to see her face for themselves.

342
00:27:34,808 --> 00:27:38,094
You've survived an airline crash
on this island.

343
00:27:38,145 --> 00:27:42,356
One minute you're in a wheelchair,
the next doing jumping jacks.

344
00:27:42,399 --> 00:27:45,104
If 5,000 people came out
to see a piece of mould,

345
00:27:45,152 --> 00:27:48,437
how many people do you think
would come out to see you?

346
00:27:52,284 --> 00:27:54,740
Charles Widmore
wants to exploit this island.

347
00:27:54,786 --> 00:27:57,360
He'll do everything in his power
to possess it.

348
00:28:14,723 --> 00:28:18,555
Everything I know about Charles Widmore
is contained in this file.

349
00:28:18,602 --> 00:28:22,552
Some of it's vague, some of it's
guesswork, some of it's concrete,

350
00:28:22,606 --> 00:28:25,477
but this is everything,
and now it's all yours.

351
00:28:30,072 --> 00:28:32,693
I'm sorry I didn't tell
you all this sooner...

352
00:28:35,077 --> 00:28:37,864
...but it was the only
bargaining chip I had left.

353
00:28:40,541 --> 00:28:42,699
There's one more thing I need to know.

354
00:28:44,711 --> 00:28:49,041
Your man on the boat,
I want you to tell me who it is.

355
00:28:52,010 --> 00:28:53,754
All right.

356
00:28:54,930 --> 00:28:57,088
But you might want to sit down.

357
00:29:05,232 --> 00:29:07,225
She came through here.

358
00:29:07,985 --> 00:29:10,476
So did they, about
half an hour ahead of her.

359
00:29:13,073 --> 00:29:15,232
- What happened?
- Sorry?

360
00:29:15,284 --> 00:29:17,276
At Locke's. Why did you stay?

361
00:29:19,121 --> 00:29:22,205
I stayed because I had
to find something out.

362
00:29:22,249 --> 00:29:23,624
Are you gonna tell me

363
00:29:23,667 --> 00:29:27,712
or are we gonna keep walking through
the jungle like it doesn't matter?

364
00:29:35,012 --> 00:29:38,594
I stayed to find out if the people
on the freighter know who I am.

365
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:41,262
If they knew that I'm a fugitive...

366
00:29:41,310 --> 00:29:43,349
...that I'm wanted for murder.

367
00:29:44,813 --> 00:29:46,853
Do they?

368
00:29:47,774 --> 00:29:49,732
Yeah, they know.

369
00:29:52,279 --> 00:29:53,939
We should keep moving.

370
00:29:54,031 --> 00:29:56,070
God knows where Juliet is.

371
00:30:34,196 --> 00:30:36,189
Hi, come on in.

372
00:30:37,366 --> 00:30:40,817
Sorry, have to get this ham
out of the oven, or it'll dry out.

373
00:30:40,869 --> 00:30:42,743
Please, don't mind me.

374
00:30:42,788 --> 00:30:45,789
- How are you feeling, by the way?
- Never better.

375
00:30:48,544 --> 00:30:50,168
Smells delicious.

376
00:30:53,924 --> 00:30:56,166
Ben, I thought this was a dinner party.

377
00:30:56,218 --> 00:30:57,498
Just you and me.

378
00:30:59,721 --> 00:31:02,047
I guess I should've made that clearer.

379
00:31:04,309 --> 00:31:07,513
No, it's fine.
I hope you like dinner rolls.

380
00:31:07,563 --> 00:31:09,520
I do indeed.

381
00:31:14,361 --> 00:31:18,228
I want to thank you for how wonderful
you've been with Zach and Emma.

382
00:31:18,323 --> 00:31:20,649
They're really sweet kids.

383
00:31:23,036 --> 00:31:28,113
Ben, they've been asking me
about their mother in Los Angeles.

384
00:31:28,167 --> 00:31:31,701
- I'm not really sure what to say.
- They'll stop asking in time.

385
00:31:32,462 --> 00:31:34,455
They're children.

386
00:31:34,506 --> 00:31:36,166
Do they really belong here?

387
00:31:37,009 --> 00:31:38,800
They're on the list, Juliet.

388
00:31:38,844 --> 00:31:42,177
Who are we to question
who's on the list and who's not?

389
00:31:44,057 --> 00:31:48,435
Now that we have everyone on the list
for the tail section what about Goodwin?

390
00:31:50,772 --> 00:31:53,098
He's been undercover for three weeks.

391
00:31:57,279 --> 00:31:59,852
He's making a case
for this woman, Ana Lucia.

392
00:32:01,366 --> 00:32:04,320
He thinks she'd be
a valuable member of our society.

393
00:32:04,369 --> 00:32:06,742
But between you and me,
I don't see it.

394
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:10,034
He feels very passionately about her.

395
00:32:10,375 --> 00:32:12,748
Almost inappropriately so.

396
00:32:13,712 --> 00:32:15,669
After losing Ethan, it's a risk.

397
00:32:15,714 --> 00:32:18,585
Goodwin stays where he's at
right now, Juliet.

398
00:32:18,634 --> 00:32:22,418
There's no reason for him
to hurry back, right?

399
00:32:22,846 --> 00:32:26,547
But his assignment will be over soon.
I promise you.

Hey!

408
00:33:17,359 --> 00:33:21,108
Juliet, what are you doing here?

409
00:33:26,702 --> 00:33:28,113
<i>Final warning.</i>

411
00:33:30,706 --> 00:33:35,166

<i>Manual override failed.

<i>One minute to contamination.</i>

415
00:33:46,430 --> 00:33:49,466
Wanna release the gas?
You'll die with the rest of us.

416
00:33:49,516 --> 00:33:53,514
No, no. I'm not trying to release it.
I'm trying to render it inert.

417
00:33:53,562 --> 00:33:57,097
Juliet, I just want to make it safe.

418
00:34:00,611 --> 00:34:02,899
<i>Forty seconds to contamination.</i>

419
00:34:14,082 --> 00:34:16,752

<i>Evacuate immediately.</i>

422
00:34:41,610 --> 00:34:43,816
<i>Twenty seconds to contamination.</i>

423
00:34:43,862 --> 00:34:46,400
Whatever he's doing, tell him to stop.

424
00:34:46,448 --> 00:34:49,817
We're trying to disable it
before he can use it against us.

425
00:34:50,577 --> 00:34:52,202
Juliet...

426
00:34:53,163 --> 00:34:55,868
...Iook me in the eye
and tell me you are certain

427
00:34:55,916 --> 00:34:59,830
Benjamin Linus wouldn't use this gas
to kill everyone on this island!

428
00:35:00,128 --> 00:35:02,168
We know he's used it before.

429
00:35:02,214 --> 00:35:04,622
If you wanna stop us,
you have to shoot us both.

430
00:35:04,675 --> 00:35:06,383
<i>Ten seconds to contamination.</i>

431
00:35:06,426 --> 00:35:08,300
- Daniel!
- Yeah, I'm trying.

432
00:35:09,972 --> 00:35:12,213
Come on!

433
00:35:12,266 --> 00:35:13,345
Come on!

434
00:35:13,392 --> 00:35:14,471
<i>... five...</i>

435
00:35:15,352 --> 00:35:16,763
<i>... four...</i>

436
00:35:17,521 --> 00:35:19,597
<i>... three...</i>

437
00:35:19,648 --> 00:35:21,475
<i>... two...</i>

438
00:35:50,804 --> 00:35:54,256
That... that was a close one.

439
00:36:15,787 --> 00:36:18,160
- What are you reading?
- Shephard's file.

440
00:36:18,207 --> 00:36:19,831
Mikhail dropped it off.

441
00:36:22,377 --> 00:36:24,584
He's a spinal surgeon, Ben.

442
00:36:24,630 --> 00:36:27,631
He has extensive experience
in tumour removal.

443
00:36:31,094 --> 00:36:33,217
- How about that?
- He can help you.

444
00:36:40,103 --> 00:36:43,852
I thought you'd be more excited.
What's wrong?

445
00:36:47,694 --> 00:36:49,734
I need you to come with me.

446
00:36:55,953 --> 00:37:00,662
After our last raid on the tail-section
survivors, they ran off, left the beach.

447
00:37:02,209 --> 00:37:06,503
I sent Pickett and Tom to track
their location. They came across this.

448
00:37:07,422 --> 00:37:09,249
I'm sorry, Juliet.

449
00:37:09,299 --> 00:37:11,339
Sorry about what?

450
00:37:14,096 --> 00:37:16,088
Oh, my God.

451
00:37:16,723 --> 00:37:18,515
Oh, my God.

452
00:37:18,559 --> 00:37:21,310
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

453
00:37:22,938 --> 00:37:24,218
Oh, my God!

454
00:37:27,234 --> 00:37:28,894
Goodwin.

455
00:37:31,530 --> 00:37:32,905
What happened?

456
00:37:34,032 --> 00:37:36,903
We don't know.
There weren't any witnesses.

457
00:37:36,994 --> 00:37:40,279
I can only assume they found out
he wasn't one of them.

458
00:37:42,124 --> 00:37:46,038
- Guess I should've listened to you.
- Why are you showing me this?

459
00:37:50,007 --> 00:37:52,462
Why did you bring me out here?

460
00:37:52,968 --> 00:37:55,589
What, you mean instead of his wife?

461
00:38:01,768 --> 00:38:03,975
You knew this would happen.

462
00:38:07,107 --> 00:38:10,642
You sent him out here because
you knew this would happen.

463
00:38:11,278 --> 00:38:15,062
You wanted this.
You wanted him to die!

464
00:38:17,117 --> 00:38:18,315
Why?

465
00:38:19,286 --> 00:38:21,362
Why?

466
00:38:22,956 --> 00:38:25,198
You're asking me why?

467
00:38:25,959 --> 00:38:30,420
After everything I did to get you here,
everything I've done to keep you here,

468
00:38:30,464 --> 00:38:33,002
how can you possibly not understand...

469
00:38:34,968 --> 00:38:37,008
...that you're mine?

470
00:38:44,895 --> 00:38:46,686
Take as much time as you need.

471
00:39:11,505 --> 00:39:14,292
Kate, it's all right.
They're on our side.

472
00:39:14,341 --> 00:39:18,090
"Our side", Juliet?
She just knocked me unconscious.

473
00:39:18,554 --> 00:39:21,673
Yeah. I'm very sorry about that,
but I had no choice!

474
00:39:24,309 --> 00:39:27,310
Look, Daniel's inside
securing the facility.

475
00:39:27,354 --> 00:39:30,390
If you come with me,
I'll be more than happy to explain

476
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:32,682
exactly how we just saved your life!

477
00:39:36,572 --> 00:39:38,564
All right, let's go.

478
00:39:42,369 --> 00:39:44,409
I'll take their word for it.

479
00:39:53,130 --> 00:39:54,873
You OK?

480
00:39:59,428 --> 00:40:01,420
He wanted me to kill them.

481
00:40:04,516 --> 00:40:06,805
Ben. He told me to kill both of them.

482
00:40:12,316 --> 00:40:15,601
- How can he tell you anything?
- I don't know.

483
00:40:15,652 --> 00:40:19,982
But he knew how to get to me, knew where
they were going, what they were doing.

484
00:40:20,032 --> 00:40:21,905
Don't you understand?

485
00:40:21,950 --> 00:40:25,319
These people came here
to wage war against Ben.

486
00:40:26,330 --> 00:40:29,699
And Ben's gonna win, Jack.

487
00:40:29,750 --> 00:40:32,834
And when he does, you don't
want to be anywhere near me.

488
00:40:34,505 --> 00:40:35,880
Why not?

489
00:40:39,384 --> 00:40:41,543
Because he thinks that I'm his.

490
00:40:44,348 --> 00:40:46,921
And he knows how I feel about you.

491
00:41:10,290 --> 00:41:12,497
He knows where to find me.

492
00:41:34,565 --> 00:41:35,845
Beat that.

493
00:41:45,617 --> 00:41:47,491
Son of a bitch!

494
00:41:49,246 --> 00:41:51,618
How'd you get so damn good
at horseshoes?

495
00:41:51,707 --> 00:41:53,995
I don't know. Guess I'm just lucky.

496
00:42:01,717 --> 00:42:04,042
What the hell are you doing out?

497
00:42:04,970 --> 00:42:06,298
See you guys at dinner.
