<i>Previously on Lost...</i>

2
00:00:01,993 --> 00:00:03,582
You better trust me when I tell you this...

3
00:00:03,682 --> 00:00:04,744
I am trying to help you.

4
00:00:05,515 --> 00:00:07,187
- Do I know you?
- I'm George Minkowsky.

5
00:00:08,014 --> 00:00:09,629
I'm the communications officer.

6
00:00:09,729 --> 00:00:10,910
Wher's the radio room?

7
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:11,887
I'll take you there.

8
00:00:13,399 --> 00:00:14,343
And how do we get out of here?

9
00:00:16,031 --> 00:00:17,096
Through the door...?

10
00:00:18,370 --> 00:00:20,699
Looks like you guys have a friend on this boat.

11
00:00:22,630 --> 00:00:23,697
You're pregnant.

12
00:00:25,358 --> 00:00:27,940
Juliet, she was their fertility doctor,

13
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:29,137
studying pregnant women.

14
00:00:29,237 --> 00:00:30,874
There is a reason The Others wanted her baby.

15
00:00:31,569 --> 00:00:33,246
It was for research.

16
00:00:33,346 --> 00:00:35,398
What happens to pregnant women
on this island?

17
00:00:35,498 --> 00:00:36,319
They die.

18
00:00:37,515 --> 00:00:40,447
You want me to help you and your baby?
I have answers to your questions,

19
00:00:40,547 --> 00:00:42,523
but you have to come with me,
right now.

20
00:00:42,623 --> 00:00:44,546
The baby isn't Jin's.

21
00:00:46,281 --> 00:00:48,574
I want to look at your baby and
determine the date of conception.

22
00:00:48,674 --> 00:00:50,214
If you got pregnant here...

23
00:00:51,909 --> 00:00:53,711
We'll cross that bridge
when we come to it.

24
00:00:53,811 --> 00:00:56,571
The baby was conceived about 8 weeks ago...

25
00:00:56,671 --> 00:00:58,292
You got pregnant on the island.

26
00:00:58,392 --> 00:01:00,130
So how long do I have?

27
00:01:02,785 --> 00:01:05,334
Most of the women made it to the
middle of their second trimester.

28
00:01:07,139 --> 00:01:08,592
Nobody made it to their third.

29
00:01:24,845 --> 00:01:25,828
Lapidus!

30
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,014
You ready?

31
00:01:39,073 --> 00:01:40,374
I'll be up.

32
00:01:42,730 --> 00:01:44,413
Don't be late, Frank.

33
00:01:57,551 --> 00:01:58,398
Regina.

34
00:01:59,202 --> 00:01:59,958
Frank.

35
00:02:00,882 --> 00:02:02,221
I didn't hear you.

36
00:02:02,811 --> 00:02:04,635
Sorry, I didn't mean to spook you.

37
00:02:05,242 --> 00:02:07,117
The captain wanted me to bring
these guys some food? ? ?

38
00:02:07,217 --> 00:02:08,585
Okay.

39
00:02:11,373 --> 00:02:13,029
You know, your book is upside down.

40
00:02:21,398 --> 00:02:22,729
Just trying to help.

41
00:02:29,272 --> 00:02:31,273
Thought I'd check in on you guys and
bring you some food.

42
00:02:31,745 --> 00:02:33,359
How are you feeling, by the way?

43
00:02:34,273 --> 00:02:35,430
Much better, thanks.

44
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:37,210
Why are we being held captive?

45
00:02:37,310 --> 00:02:39,392
We had nothing to do
with Minkowsky's death.

46
00:02:39,492 --> 00:02:41,372
this has nothing to do
with Minkowsky.

47
00:02:41,472 --> 00:02:43,878
The captain wasn't very happy that you two
decided to bust out of sick bay

48
00:02:43,978 --> 00:02:45,493
and into our radio room.

49
00:02:45,593 --> 00:02:46,553
We didn't bust out.

50
00:02:46,653 --> 00:02:48,290
The door was left open.

51
00:02:50,394 --> 00:02:51,393
We assumed that was you.

52
00:02:51,493 --> 00:02:52,591
Why the hell would I do that?

53
00:02:54,693 --> 00:02:56,701
Did you have any contact
with our people on the beach?

54
00:02:57,666 --> 00:03:00,170
No luck.
Something must have happened to the phone.

55
00:03:03,882 --> 00:03:05,414
Lima bits?

56
00:03:06,681 --> 00:03:08,392
Sorry, we had a little problem in the kitchen.

57
00:03:10,133 --> 00:03:11,175
Just stay put, all right?

58
00:03:13,457 --> 00:03:15,103
I still want to talk to the captain.

59
00:03:17,374 --> 00:03:18,315
No, you don't.

60
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:22,982
Regina.

61
00:03:34,433 --> 00:03:36,093
What's wrong?

62
00:03:38,211 --> 00:03:41,532
Sayid and Desmond left three days ago.

63
00:03:42,027 --> 00:03:44,035
Why haven't they come back?

64
00:03:45,713 --> 00:03:48,241
Perhaps they are returning with the ship.

65
00:03:54,470 --> 00:03:55,507
Now come on...

66
00:03:56,190 --> 00:03:59,616
we have more important things to talk about.

67
00:04:00,597 --> 00:04:01,490
Like what?

68
00:04:03,208 --> 00:04:04,749
Let's talk about baby names.

69
00:04:06,494 --> 00:04:08,297
Good. You're getting better.

70
00:04:09,797 --> 00:04:10,454
But no, Jin.

71
00:04:10,554 --> 00:04:13,946
It's bad luck to talk about baby names now.

72
00:04:14,046 --> 00:04:16,364
Superstitious?

73
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:20,215
I don't want to jinx him.

74
00:04:20,315 --> 00:04:22,855
You mean her.

75
00:04:22,955 --> 00:04:25,712
Oh, it's going to be a girl, is it?

76
00:04:26,912 --> 00:04:28,412
Ji Yeon.

77
00:04:29,047 --> 00:04:31,080
I want to name her Ji Yeon.

78
00:04:32,204 --> 00:04:34,296
I don't want to talk about names.

79
00:04:34,396 --> 00:04:35,728
You don't like Ji Yeon?

80
00:04:36,972 --> 00:04:39,576
No, it's beautiful.

81
00:04:41,303 --> 00:04:42,366
I'll tell you what.

82
00:04:43,683 --> 00:04:45,434
Let's get off the island first.

83
00:04:45,534 --> 00:04:47,828
Then we can pick a name.

84
00:04:49,495 --> 00:04:50,346
Deal.

85
00:05:42,903 --> 00:05:44,022
Emergency services.

86
00:05:46,507 --> 00:05:47,693
I need an ambulance...

87
00:05:48,994 --> 00:05:50,369
What seems to be the problem?

88
00:05:51,309 --> 00:05:52,528
I'm pregnant...

89
00:05:52,628 --> 00:05:54,375
and I think something's wrong.

90
00:06:04,573 --> 00:06:06,573

Can I help you?

94
00:06:49,102 --> 00:06:51,419
Is there something you're looking for?

95
00:06:51,519 --> 00:06:53,701
Yes...a panda.

96
00:06:54,508 --> 00:06:55,654
This way, please.

97
00:07:01,306 --> 00:07:02,153
Good.

98
00:07:02,253 --> 00:07:03,552
Give me that one.

99
00:07:07,174 --> 00:07:10,067
Would you like it gift wrapped?

100
00:07:10,167 --> 00:07:13,990
No, I have to get to the hospital.

101
00:07:14,090 --> 00:07:15,079
How much is it?

102
00:07:15,179 --> 00:07:16,279
Fifty thousand won.

103
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:18,753
Maternity ward?

104
00:07:19,701 --> 00:07:20,367
Yes.

105
00:07:20,467 --> 00:07:22,756
Why didn't you say so?

106
00:07:23,409 --> 00:07:25,439
You must be very happy...

107
00:07:25,539 --> 00:07:27,471
Boy or a girl?

108
00:07:28,172 --> 00:07:29,390
I...I don't know yet.

109
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:30,475
Don't worry.

110
00:07:30,575 --> 00:07:32,974
Everyone loves a panda.

111
00:07:36,710 --> 00:07:39,595
Yes, yes. I'm on my way...

112
00:07:39,695 --> 00:07:41,320
I'm on my way.

113
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:42,667
I understand.

114
00:07:45,108 --> 00:07:46,286
Good luck!

115
00:07:47,886 --> 00:07:49,186
Jin!

116
00:07:49,286 --> 00:07:50,686
Jin!

117
00:07:52,270 --> 00:07:53,545
Kate and Jack are back.

118
00:08:00,970 --> 00:08:02,255
What happened?

119
00:08:02,355 --> 00:08:05,220
You mean, before or after
the redhead knocked me out?

120
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:08,885
She hit you?

121
00:08:08,985 --> 00:08:11,815
When I ran into them on my
way back from Locke's camp.

122
00:08:11,915 --> 00:08:13,760
Why would she do that?

123
00:08:14,370 --> 00:08:19,590
I guess she didn't wanna have to explain
why she was on her way to a poison gas factory.

124
00:08:21,140 --> 00:08:23,855
Juliet told Jack that it was a power station.

125
00:08:23,955 --> 00:08:26,815
Why would Juliet lie about that?

126
00:08:26,915 --> 00:08:29,220
Force of habit?

127
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:31,695
Why were they going there?

128
00:08:31,795 --> 00:08:34,315
To turn it off, to deactivate the gas.

129
00:08:34,415 --> 00:08:37,290
I guess they wanted to
earn some brownie points.

130
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:42,085
Do you think they're really going to rescue us?

131
00:08:42,185 --> 00:08:45,375
In all the time they've been here,
they've talked about a lot of things,

132
00:08:45,475 --> 00:08:49,240
and none involved rescuing us.

133
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:11,200
Good morning.

134
00:09:12,530 --> 00:09:14,695
Good morning.

135
00:09:14,795 --> 00:09:18,180
I hope they resolve their kitchen issues.

136
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:26,010
Sayid.

137
00:09:27,530 --> 00:09:29,720
What's that?

138
00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:37,410
It's a note.

139
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:42,490
Three days ago, when I was in Locke's camp,

140
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:46,710
Ben claimed he had a spy on this boat.

141
00:09:55,060 --> 00:09:58,060
Don't trust Captain.

142
00:10:05,910 --> 00:10:07,520
Hello.

143
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:08,765
My name is Sun.

144
00:10:08,865 --> 00:10:10,225
Hi, Sun.

145
00:10:10,325 --> 00:10:12,000
I'm Daniel.

146
00:10:16,310 --> 00:10:18,805
Something I can help you with?

147
00:10:18,905 --> 00:10:21,740
I'm two months pregnant.

148
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:23,990
Oh, you're...

149
00:10:24,090 --> 00:10:26,325
Wow, that's...

150
00:10:26,425 --> 00:10:28,335
Congratulations.

151
00:10:28,435 --> 00:10:31,400
So are you here to rescue us?

152
00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:36,835
It's a simple question.

153
00:10:36,935 --> 00:10:40,620
Are you or are you not going to rescue us?

154
00:10:42,070 --> 00:10:45,960
The thing is, um...

155
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:49,665
it's not really my call, Sun.

156
00:10:49,765 --> 00:10:52,680
Then whose call is it?

157
00:10:55,810 --> 00:10:58,190
Thank you.

158
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:02,490
Uh, can you pass, uh, the cereal?

159
00:11:09,650 --> 00:11:10,985
Pretty good English, Jin.

160
00:11:11,085 --> 00:11:12,190
Thank you.

161
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:16,590
I... understand better than I, uh, speak.

162
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:20,830
Has Sun been teaching you,
or are you just picking it up?

163
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:23,035
Uh, Sun teach me.

164
00:11:23,135 --> 00:11:25,235
Uh, Sawyer, too.

165
00:11:25,335 --> 00:11:28,090
Sun is... better.

166
00:11:28,450 --> 00:11:30,280
I bet.

167
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:35,395
Hey, Sun. How you feeling?

168
00:11:35,495 --> 00:11:37,820
I'm good. Thank you.

169
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:43,055
The morning sickness has
stopped, which has been nice.

170
00:11:43,155 --> 00:11:46,010
That's good. Well...

171
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:50,610
if you need anything,
just let me know, okay?

172
00:11:54,710 --> 00:11:56,510
Would you like some breakfast?

173
00:11:56,780 --> 00:11:57,825
Jin...

174
00:11:57,925 --> 00:12:01,300
You need to do as I say
and not ask questions.

175
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:03,765
What's the matter?

176
00:12:03,865 --> 00:12:06,560
You need to find food for two days.

177
00:12:07,710 --> 00:12:10,360
Meet me at the tent in twenty minutes.

178
00:12:10,810 --> 00:12:12,105
Why?

179
00:12:12,205 --> 00:12:13,550
What's happened?

180
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:20,090
We're going to Locke's camp.

181
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:35,330
What are you doing?

182
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:43,175
I needed another bottle of those
vitamins you gave me, the--the prenatals.

183
00:12:43,275 --> 00:12:45,145
You could've just asked.

184
00:12:45,245 --> 00:12:47,325
You're right. I should have.

185
00:12:47,425 --> 00:12:50,340
What happened to the
last ones I gave you?

186
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:52,275
Sorry?

187
00:12:52,375 --> 00:12:56,170
The last bottle I gave you.
There should be 20 left.

188
00:12:56,420 --> 00:12:59,170
Are you planning a trip?

189
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:02,690
Please, just give me the vitamins.

190
00:13:03,410 --> 00:13:06,160
Where are you going, Sun?

191
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:10,850
- We're going to Locke's camp.
- What?

192
00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:14,005
Why?

193
00:13:14,105 --> 00:13:15,965
Because I don't trust these people.

194
00:13:16,065 --> 00:13:18,165
Whether you trust them
or not, you can't go there.

195
00:13:18,265 --> 00:13:22,840
Locke doesn't want to leave the island,
and I've told you, Sun, pregnant women...

196
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:25,005
they don't survive here.

197
00:13:25,105 --> 00:13:28,370
Yes, you did tell me that.

198
00:13:28,930 --> 00:13:31,450
You don't believe me.

199
00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:36,800
Look, I know that I have been less than
truthful about certain things since coming here,

200
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:40,160
but I promise you, Sun, I promise you...

201
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:43,530
I'm not lying about this.

202
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:49,480
After everything you've confided in me, 
I should at least have your trust.

203
00:13:51,290 --> 00:13:53,415
Claire's baby is fine.

204
00:13:53,515 --> 00:13:55,655
I feel fine.

205
00:13:55,755 --> 00:13:59,465
All I have are your stories that
I'm going to get sick.

206
00:13:59,565 --> 00:14:04,180
I'm going to do what's best for
me and for my baby, because, no...

207
00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:07,430
I don't trust you.

208
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:17,735
It's okay. It's going to be okay.

209
00:14:17,835 --> 00:14:18,635
Is that--?

210
00:14:18,735 --> 00:14:21,020
Yes. Oceanic Six.

211
00:14:27,470 --> 00:14:29,955
Stop! What are you doing?

212
00:14:30,055 --> 00:14:32,670
We remove all jewelry.

213
00:14:32,980 --> 00:14:35,195
It's for the swelling.

214
00:14:35,295 --> 00:14:37,125
No! Not my ring!

215
00:14:37,225 --> 00:14:38,870
Nothing will happen to it.

216
00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:41,370
It's okay.

217
00:14:41,850 --> 00:14:44,640
Mrs. Kwon. I'm Dr. Bae.

218
00:14:44,950 --> 00:14:46,695
I'm on duty for Dr. Park.

219
00:14:46,795 --> 00:14:49,415
Where is he? What's happening?

220
00:14:49,515 --> 00:14:51,350
He's away at a conference...

221
00:14:52,230 --> 00:14:54,460
Get her something for the pain.

222
00:14:59,150 --> 00:15:00,820
Now let me take a look...

223
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:06,375
Is something wrong with my baby?

224
00:15:06,475 --> 00:15:09,175
It is in distress.

225
00:15:09,275 --> 00:15:11,100
What's wrong?

226
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:13,345
I don't know yet.

227
00:15:13,445 --> 00:15:15,560
That's what I'm going to find out.

228
00:15:17,270 --> 00:15:19,225
Is there anyone we should contact?

229
00:15:19,325 --> 00:15:21,960
Your husband? Your parents?

230
00:15:23,230 --> 00:15:26,510
Just get Jin...my husband...

231
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:29,065
Jin...

232
00:15:29,165 --> 00:15:30,325
Just get Jin...

233
00:15:30,425 --> 00:15:32,770
I'll try to reach him.

234
00:15:33,210 --> 00:15:35,235
Get my...husband...

235
00:15:35,335 --> 00:15:37,430
I'm sure he'll be here soon.

236
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:40,920
Jin...

237
00:15:42,580 --> 00:15:43,540
Taxi!

238
00:15:51,130 --> 00:15:53,615
Yes, I'm on my way...Hello?

239
00:15:53,715 --> 00:15:55,180
Hello...

240
00:15:56,060 --> 00:15:57,870
Hey! What is this?

241
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:10,175
Stop!

242
00:16:10,275 --> 00:16:11,590
You bastard!

243
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:13,865
I will kill you!

244
00:16:13,965 --> 00:16:15,430
If I find you!

245
00:16:15,780 --> 00:16:19,710
I will hunt you down
and rip your head off!

246
00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:33,345
I need another panda!

247
00:16:33,445 --> 00:16:36,920
I'm sorry, that was the last one.

248
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:40,085
What about that one?

249
00:16:40,185 --> 00:16:41,940
It's right behind you!

250
00:16:43,470 --> 00:16:45,315
That one is on hold.

251
00:16:45,415 --> 00:16:47,405
They're quite popular.

252
00:16:47,505 --> 00:16:48,455
How much do you want?

253
00:16:48,555 --> 00:16:50,410
It's already paid for.

254
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:55,565
What about this...

255
00:16:55,665 --> 00:16:57,445
In the year of the dragon

256
00:16:57,545 --> 00:16:59,050
it brings good luck.

257
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:03,270
I need the panda.

258
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:14,260
Don't lose this one.

259
00:17:17,580 --> 00:17:20,475
Once you hit the stream, 
you wanna head northwest,

260
00:17:20,575 --> 00:17:23,045
pretty much in a straight line
for about a day and a half.

261
00:17:23,145 --> 00:17:24,710
Thank you.

262
00:17:25,430 --> 00:17:27,960
I'm gonna have to tell Jack.

263
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:30,780
But I'll give you guys a nice, long head start.

264
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:33,485
I'd tell him myself, but he wouldn't understand.

265
00:17:33,585 --> 00:17:36,300
No, he wouldn't

266
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:39,470
You better get going.

267
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:42,075
Be safe, okay?

268
00:17:42,175 --> 00:17:42,905
Thank you.

269
00:17:43,005 --> 00:17:45,345
She's not going anywhere.

270
00:17:45,445 --> 00:17:47,365
Sun, this is a bad idea.

271
00:17:47,465 --> 00:17:49,815
What concern is it of yours?

272
00:17:49,915 --> 00:17:53,890
Do you understand your wife's
medical condition right now?

273
00:17:54,850 --> 00:17:56,920
Translate for me.

274
00:17:57,020 --> 00:17:59,110
No.

275
00:17:59,770 --> 00:18:03,325
Your wife is very sick.

276
00:18:03,425 --> 00:18:07,690
If she doesn't get off this island
in three weeks, she will die.

277
00:18:13,130 --> 00:18:17,315
If you let her go, your wife is in danger. Jin...

278
00:18:17,415 --> 00:18:19,470
Danger.

279
00:18:20,090 --> 00:18:23,560
Wherever Sun go... I go.

280
00:18:25,730 --> 00:18:29,110
Sun. Please.

281
00:18:34,170 --> 00:18:36,240
Jin.

282
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:39,510
Your wife had an affair.

283
00:18:42,610 --> 00:18:43,625
What?

284
00:18:43,725 --> 00:18:47,380
Sun was with another man.

285
00:18:50,180 --> 00:18:52,470
She thought the baby was his.

286
00:19:34,510 --> 00:19:35,580
Jin...

287
00:19:36,370 --> 00:19:37,660
Jin...

288
00:19:38,090 --> 00:19:41,510
Talk to me. Let me explain.

289
00:19:41,990 --> 00:19:44,000
It was a long time ago.

290
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:47,640
Look at me.

291
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:49,840
Just look at me.

292
00:19:50,630 --> 00:19:52,915
I understand you're angry.

293
00:19:53,015 --> 00:19:55,190
And I have no excuse.

294
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:58,960
Please let me explain.

295
00:19:59,890 --> 00:20:02,035
Let me explain!

296
00:20:02,135 --> 00:20:03,860
Jin...

297
00:20:06,650 --> 00:20:08,220
You going fishing?

298
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:12,080
Uh, you mind if I... tag along?

299
00:20:15,030 --> 00:20:18,565
Oh, I am sorry. I-I didn't mean to interrupt.

300
00:20:18,665 --> 00:20:21,325
No. Come.

301
00:20:21,425 --> 00:20:23,320
You sure?

302
00:20:24,290 --> 00:20:27,150
Yes. Come.

303
00:20:49,670 --> 00:20:53,060
You realize we're the only
two married guys on the island?

304
00:20:54,990 --> 00:20:57,270
Married.

305
00:20:57,790 --> 00:20:58,955
Married.

306
00:20:59,055 --> 00:21:01,865
Yeah, well, no, not to each other. No.

307
00:21:01,965 --> 00:21:03,960
You got it.

308
00:21:04,690 --> 00:21:07,045
It's not easy, is it?

309
00:21:07,145 --> 00:21:10,045
Oh, I mean, it's--it's wonderful, but...

310
00:21:10,145 --> 00:21:14,455
let's face it. Every decision
that you make takes twice as long

311
00:21:14,555 --> 00:21:16,920
'cause you always gotta talk them into it.

312
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:22,850
Rose...

313
00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:25,820
has cancer.

314
00:21:28,290 --> 00:21:29,900
She's sick.

315
00:21:30,650 --> 00:21:32,170
Dying.

316
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:35,690
Well, at least, she was dying.

317
00:21:36,510 --> 00:21:39,200
She says she's better now.

318
00:21:39,650 --> 00:21:41,740
She says it's this place...

319
00:21:42,430 --> 00:21:44,520
the island.

320
00:21:45,970 --> 00:21:48,220
But when the camp split up,

321
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:51,320
I was sure that she'd want to go with Locke.

322
00:21:52,030 --> 00:21:57,370
Why would she want to leave the
island and risk getting sick again?

323
00:21:59,070 --> 00:22:02,330
Uh, then why do you stay with Jack?

324
00:22:02,430 --> 00:22:05,020
Because it was the right thing to do.

325
00:22:05,790 --> 00:22:07,190
Locke?

326
00:22:08,450 --> 00:22:10,640
He's a murderer.

327
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,950
See, it's all about karma, Jin.

328
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:18,110
Do you know karma?

329
00:22:19,230 --> 00:22:22,050
You make bad choices,
bad things happen to you.

330
00:22:22,150 --> 00:22:24,300
But you make good choices,
and then good-- hey!

331
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:26,100
Hey, hey, hey! You got one.

332
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:27,710
Yeah. Here, pull it in.

333
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:31,670
Wow, look at that!

334
00:22:31,770 --> 00:22:33,190
Yeah, you see?

335
00:22:33,290 --> 00:22:35,080
Now that's karma.

336
00:22:36,690 --> 00:22:38,930
We must be the good guys, huh?

337
00:22:53,630 --> 00:22:55,460
How long's that gonna go on for, eh?

338
00:22:56,660 --> 00:22:59,230
Can't they just fix whatever the
bloody hell's causing that?

339
00:22:59,330 --> 00:23:01,610
That sound is not mechanical.

340
00:23:01,890 --> 00:23:03,710
What, you think somebody's doing that?

341
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:06,010
Somebody's just banging
those pipes again and again?

342
00:23:06,110 --> 00:23:08,350
That's exactly what I think.

343
00:23:11,250 --> 00:23:12,590
Gentlemen...

344
00:23:12,690 --> 00:23:15,080
thanks for your patience.

345
00:23:15,180 --> 00:23:18,210
The captain would like to see you now.

346
00:23:34,030 --> 00:23:35,740
Where's the helicopter?

347
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:37,730
Lapidus is running an errand.

348
00:23:37,830 --> 00:23:39,510
What kind of errand?

349
00:23:39,610 --> 00:23:41,710
I'm a doctor. I don't know where he's going.

350
00:23:41,810 --> 00:23:43,220
Did he go to the island?

351
00:23:44,170 --> 00:23:46,280
You know anywhere else he could land?

352
00:23:46,380 --> 00:23:47,900
What's he going to do?

353
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,840
I said I'm just a doctor.

354
00:23:50,940 --> 00:23:52,960
What did Lapidus say?

355
00:23:53,060 --> 00:23:55,650
He didn't say anything.

356
00:23:55,750 --> 00:23:57,600
What is he doing?

357
00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:05,860
That woman just jumped
over the side of the ship!

358
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:08,170
Don't just stand there!

359
00:24:08,270 --> 00:24:09,380
What's the matter with you people?

360
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:10,730
What's wrong with you? Get a rope!

361
00:24:10,830 --> 00:24:12,400
Why aren't you doing anything?

362
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:13,680
Bring a rope!

363
00:24:13,780 --> 00:24:14,560
Get a rope!

364
00:24:14,660 --> 00:24:16,220
- Get a rope!
- Stop!

365
00:24:16,550 --> 00:24:17,800
She just jumped!

366
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:19,090
It's over.

367
00:24:19,190 --> 00:24:21,140
She's gone.

368
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:24,100
Everybodyget back to your posts.

369
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:28,560
That was an order.

370
00:24:35,950 --> 00:24:38,150
I'm captain Gault.

371
00:24:39,270 --> 00:24:42,080
I suppose you two have a few questions.

372
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:48,900
So what can I do for you?

373
00:24:49,170 --> 00:24:50,020
What?

374
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:51,850
You boys said you wanted to speak with me.

375
00:24:51,950 --> 00:24:53,753
Let's just start with why
a woman jumped over the...

376
00:24:53,853 --> 00:24:55,620
side of your ship,
and you did nothing to stop it.

377
00:24:55,720 --> 00:25:02,010
I didn't jump in or order my crew to jump in
because I didn't want to lose any more people.

378
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:06,020
What exactly is going on here?

379
00:25:07,930 --> 00:25:10,910
Some of my crew has been dealing with...

380
00:25:11,350 --> 00:25:16,180
what might best be described as
a heightened case of cabin fever.

381
00:25:17,510 --> 00:25:20,840
I think it's got something to do with
the close proximity of the island.

382
00:25:20,940 --> 00:25:22,220
Why don't you turn around, then?

383
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:27,700
I've tried, but we have a saboteur on board,
and he's done one hell of a job on my engines.

384
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:30,550
I've got my crew working 
around the clock to repair them.

385
00:25:30,650 --> 00:25:31,970
And then you'll take our people home?

386
00:25:32,070 --> 00:25:34,980
Then we move to safer waters.

387
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:36,450
Those are my orders.

388
00:25:36,550 --> 00:25:39,360
And I don't suppose you'll tell us
who gave you those orders?

389
00:25:39,460 --> 00:25:40,650
Sure, I will.

390
00:25:40,750 --> 00:25:42,670
Charles Widmore.

391
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:47,890
This is Charles Widmore's boat?

392
00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:51,690
That's right. You know him.

393
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:09,370
Do either of you know what this is?

394
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:13,420
It's a flight data recorder,
otherwise known as a black box.

395
00:26:14,030 --> 00:26:15,900
That's exactly what it is.

396
00:26:16,540 --> 00:26:18,920
Now here's the funny thing.

397
00:26:19,350 --> 00:26:24,140
This black box comes from
oceanic flight 8-1-5.

398
00:26:26,790 --> 00:26:30,100
A salvage vessel recovered
it from the bottom of the ocean.

399
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:35,010
It took a considerable amount of
Mr. Widmore's resources to procure it.

400
00:26:35,110 --> 00:26:41,090
It was found with the wreckage of the plane,
along with all 324 dead passengers.

401
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:47,580
That's not the complete story,
as you are well aware, Mr. Jarrah,

402
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:51,680
given the fact that you're 
standing here, breathing.

403
00:26:53,250 --> 00:26:55,750
The wreckage was obviously staged.

404
00:26:55,850 --> 00:26:58,613
Now can you imagine what kind of resources and...

405
00:26:58,713 --> 00:27:01,770
manpower go into pulling off
a feat of that magnitude?

406
00:27:01,870 --> 00:27:05,300
Faking the recovery of a plane crash?

407
00:27:05,900 --> 00:27:11,330
Putting 324 families through a
grieving process based on a lie?

408
00:27:12,210 --> 00:27:14,690
But what's even more disturbing--

409
00:27:14,790 --> 00:27:20,450
where exactly does one come
across 324 dead bodies?

410
00:27:21,580 --> 00:27:28,780
And that, Mr. Jarrah, Mr. Hume, is just one
of the many reasons we want Benjamin Linus.

411
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:42,650
I'm sorry.

412
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:48,360
I had to stop you any way I could.

413
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:52,880
It wasn't your place to stop us.

414
00:27:52,980 --> 00:27:58,120
I know you don't trust me, but you
need to get off this island. We all do.

415
00:27:58,510 --> 00:28:00,360
You want to leave?

416
00:28:00,610 --> 00:28:03,100
More than anything.

417
00:28:04,110 --> 00:28:08,330
I don't know if that boat out there is
the answer or not, but it's something.

418
00:28:10,130 --> 00:28:12,460
I need to go home.

419
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:14,450
So do you.

420
00:28:14,550 --> 00:28:16,260
Sun...

421
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:22,200
In about three weeks, you'll be in
an almost constant state of nausea.

422
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:26,770
A week after that, you will experience
shortness of breath that won't go away.

423
00:28:26,870 --> 00:28:31,620
A week after that, you will lose
consciousness and slip into a coma.

424
00:28:32,350 --> 00:28:35,160
And then, Sun, you will die.

425
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:40,410
And when your heart stops beating...

426
00:28:40,870 --> 00:28:43,790
so will the baby's.

427
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:51,390
And that, Sun, is why it is my business,
because you are my patient.

428
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:55,910
If you go...

429
00:28:56,940 --> 00:28:59,290
you will die...

430
00:29:01,140 --> 00:29:04,650
and your baby will never be born.

431
00:29:12,330 --> 00:29:15,500
I have to perform a c-section.

432
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:16,820
No.

433
00:29:17,060 --> 00:29:18,950
You don't understand...

434
00:29:19,050 --> 00:29:23,250
the medication makes a
natural birth difficult.

435
00:29:23,350 --> 00:29:25,310
No, no! Not until Jin...

436
00:29:25,410 --> 00:29:26,620
We've got to get to surgery.

437
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:27,920
Where is my husband?

438
00:29:28,020 --> 00:29:29,490
He's no here yet.

439
00:29:29,590 --> 00:29:31,610
We cannot wait.

440
00:29:31,710 --> 00:29:33,330
Jin.

441
00:29:33,430 --> 00:29:34,680
Jin.

442
00:29:34,780 --> 00:29:35,530
Dr. Bae.

443
00:29:35,630 --> 00:29:37,690
The baby is crowning.

444
00:29:38,330 --> 00:29:41,730
Ok, Sun. You need to push now.

445
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:52,690
That's it... Push! Push!

446
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:55,440
You can do it.

447
00:29:56,540 --> 00:29:58,290
That's it. Push.

448
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:11,090
You did it.

449
00:30:23,210 --> 00:30:25,120
Congratulations.

450
00:30:25,220 --> 00:30:27,770
You have a baby daughter.

451
00:31:08,810 --> 00:31:10,810
So what'd you think of the captain?

452
00:31:11,180 --> 00:31:13,190
He was surprisingly forthcoming.

453
00:31:13,290 --> 00:31:15,090
Yeah, he tells it like it is.

454
00:31:15,190 --> 00:31:17,000
Just don't piss him off.

455
00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:18,720
You know what I mean?

456
00:31:18,820 --> 00:31:21,440
I think you'll like your room.
It's on a quiet part of the ship.

457
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:24,110
This ship isn't moving.

458
00:31:24,210 --> 00:31:26,280
Well, if you say so.

459
00:31:36,630 --> 00:31:39,530
That shouldn't still be there. Damn it.

460
00:31:42,590 --> 00:31:45,480
Hey, Johnson. Is that you?

461
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:47,650
- Johnson?
- Yeah.

462
00:31:48,230 --> 00:31:50,000
Mop this up.

463
00:31:50,410 --> 00:31:51,370
Sorry.

464
00:31:51,470 --> 00:31:52,910
I gotta go up on deck.

465
00:31:53,010 --> 00:31:55,950
No, you're gonna mop this up!

466
00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:21,110
Kevin, this is, uh...

467
00:32:21,210 --> 00:32:23,260
Sayid.

468
00:32:25,030 --> 00:32:26,600
Desmond.

469
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:28,870
Kevin Johnson.

470
00:32:30,810 --> 00:32:33,510
Nice to meet you, Kevin.

471
00:32:53,430 --> 00:32:54,610
I made...

472
00:32:54,710 --> 00:32:56,690
dinner.

473
00:33:01,660 --> 00:33:04,490
I thought you had left me.

474
00:33:10,660 --> 00:33:12,940
Will you let me try to explain?

475
00:33:14,580 --> 00:33:16,220
It won't matter.

476
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:17,730
Just listen, maybe...

477
00:33:18,010 --> 00:33:20,830
I know why you did it.

478
00:33:21,490 --> 00:33:24,290
I know the man...

479
00:33:24,390 --> 00:33:26,630
I used to be.

480
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:30,700
Before this island

481
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:33,090
I withheld my affections...

482
00:33:35,190 --> 00:33:37,120
and I know...

483
00:33:37,220 --> 00:33:39,510
that whatever you did...

484
00:33:41,750 --> 00:33:46,310
you did to that man.

485
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:50,900
His actions caused this.

486
00:33:59,910 --> 00:34:02,610
So I forgive you.

487
00:34:12,620 --> 00:34:15,730
So I will go to Locke's camp with you.

488
00:34:17,380 --> 00:34:19,420
I don't want to go there anymore.

489
00:34:20,900 --> 00:34:22,160
Why?

490
00:34:22,670 --> 00:34:24,920
Juliet was very convincing.

491
00:34:27,180 --> 00:34:31,100
We have to get off this island.

492
00:34:33,580 --> 00:34:36,600
These people have a helicopter.

493
00:34:37,340 --> 00:34:39,310
We have to try.

494
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:43,160
I'll do all it takes to protect
you and the baby.

495
00:34:44,030 --> 00:34:45,490
I promise.

496
00:34:49,450 --> 00:34:51,830
Thank you.

497
00:34:55,650 --> 00:34:57,950
There's just one thing.

498
00:34:58,490 --> 00:35:00,240
And please, the truth....

499
00:35:02,110 --> 00:35:03,950
Anything.

500
00:35:06,710 --> 00:35:07,890
Is...

501
00:35:07,990 --> 00:35:10,000
the baby...

502
00:35:10,470 --> 00:35:12,770
mine?

503
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:24,550
Yes, Jin.

504
00:35:29,930 --> 00:35:32,690
I swear the baby is yours.

505
00:35:34,670 --> 00:35:36,650
It's yours.

506
00:35:39,890 --> 00:35:41,620
I love you so much.

507
00:35:43,380 --> 00:35:46,090
I thought I had lost you.

508
00:35:49,870 --> 00:35:51,500
I love you, too.

509
00:35:53,290 --> 00:35:56,580
And you will never lose me.

510
00:36:17,810 --> 00:36:19,300
I am Jin-soo kwon.

511
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:21,510
I represent Paik Automotive.

512
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:23,390
Yes.

513
00:36:23,490 --> 00:36:26,050
I heard the Ambassador
is now a grandfather.

514
00:36:27,180 --> 00:36:29,910
I came to present a gift.

515
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:32,780
Wait here.

516
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:35,840
Excuse me.

517
00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:37,630
Is it a boy or a girl?

518
00:36:37,730 --> 00:36:40,510
A boy.

519
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:52,470
Yes?

520
00:36:52,570 --> 00:36:54,180
Mr. Ambassador,

521
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:56,060
this panda is a symbol
of Mr. Paik's eagerness....

522
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:59,360
to do business in the
great country of China.

523
00:36:59,460 --> 00:37:03,560
Please accept his congratulations.

524
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:06,710
Thank Mr. Paik for me.

525
00:37:06,810 --> 00:37:08,570
Tell him I'll call.

526
00:37:27,490 --> 00:37:28,620
Leaving so soon?

527
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:30,820
It wasn't my baby.

528
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:32,610
Well, maybe someday...

529
00:37:32,710 --> 00:37:34,290
Don't rush me.

530
00:37:35,190 --> 00:37:37,540
I've only been married two months.

531
00:38:15,490 --> 00:38:17,610
I can't believe you came all this way.

532
00:38:17,710 --> 00:38:18,900
Are you kidding?

533
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,830
Is anyone else coming?

534
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:22,390
No.

535
00:38:22,490 --> 00:38:23,980
Good.

536
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:26,640
So...

537
00:38:26,740 --> 00:38:28,630
Where is she?

538
00:38:33,410 --> 00:38:34,380
Come here.

539
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:36,160
She's awesome.

540
00:38:36,260 --> 00:38:38,290
Thank you.

541
00:38:40,790 --> 00:38:42,790
Would you like to hold her?

542
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:44,420
I don't know.
I...

543
00:38:44,690 --> 00:38:46,340
I kind of have two left hands.

544
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:48,690
I trust you.

545
00:38:52,420 --> 00:38:53,880
Wow.

546
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:57,680
She looks just like Jin.

547
00:38:58,770 --> 00:39:00,280
Yes...

548
00:39:00,380 --> 00:39:03,100
She does.

549
00:39:07,780 --> 00:39:09,280
So...

550
00:39:09,380 --> 00:39:12,830
I guess we should, like, go see him.

551
00:39:14,070 --> 00:39:16,600
Of course.

552
00:40:03,030 --> 00:40:04,640
Jin....

553
00:40:09,690 --> 00:40:12,340
you were right.

554
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:15,830
It's a girl.

555
00:40:24,450 --> 00:40:26,530
The delivery was hard on me...

556
00:40:29,210 --> 00:40:33,920
The doctor said I was
calling out for you...

557
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:39,760
I wish you could've been there.

558
00:40:44,530 --> 00:40:46,030
Jin....

559
00:40:46,130 --> 00:40:48,400
She's beautiful.

560
00:40:52,460 --> 00:40:54,390
Ji Yeon.

561
00:40:54,670 --> 00:40:57,880
I named her just like you wanted.

562
00:41:05,810 --> 00:41:07,670
I miss you so much.

563
00:41:12,210 --> 00:41:14,710
I miss you so much.
