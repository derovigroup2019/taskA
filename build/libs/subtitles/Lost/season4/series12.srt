1
00:00:14,827 --> 00:00:16,535
We got a little chop ahead.

2
00:00:20,083 --> 00:00:22,241
Put that away.
You're freaking me out.

3
00:00:22,293 --> 00:00:24,120
We need this thing.

4
00:00:24,170 --> 00:00:28,334
With the cargo we got
back there? Bad mojo.

5
00:00:28,716 --> 00:00:30,590
- Ms Decker?
- Yes.

6
00:00:30,635 --> 00:00:34,585
- Wanna let 'em know we're landing?
- Sure. Of course.

7
00:00:47,151 --> 00:00:49,227
We're coming in for a landing.

8
00:00:51,906 --> 00:00:55,322
It's a military facility
just west of Honolulu.

9
00:00:55,368 --> 00:00:57,407
It's completely private.

10
00:00:59,664 --> 00:01:02,416
Your families are already here.

11
00:01:05,169 --> 00:01:08,373
Now, there's a lot of press
that want to speak to you.

12
00:01:08,423 --> 00:01:14,046
But as far as Oceanic is concerned, you
don't have to speak to any reporters.

13
00:01:18,016 --> 00:01:19,296
We'll talk to them.

14
00:01:23,187 --> 00:01:25,560
Is that all right with all of you?

15
00:01:26,607 --> 00:01:30,557
It's fine. We all agreed.
We just want to get it over with.

16
00:01:30,611 --> 00:01:35,986
OK. They're referring to you
as the "Oceanic Six."

17
00:01:36,242 --> 00:01:40,287
Not the best branding as far
as we're concerned, but it is catchy.

18
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:43,913
We'll see you on the ground.

19
00:01:54,052 --> 00:01:56,590
We all know the story.

20
00:01:56,637 --> 00:02:01,015
If we get any questions that we don't
want to answer, or that we can't answer,

21
00:02:01,059 --> 00:02:03,514
let's just keep our mouths shut.

22
00:02:08,316 --> 00:02:11,151
It's OK. They'll think
that we're in shock.

23
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:14,979
We are in shock, Jack.

24
00:02:16,157 --> 00:02:19,491
Well, then this should be easy.

25
00:04:48,059 --> 00:04:51,926
It was Sayid and Desmond
in the helicopter, right?

26
00:04:51,979 --> 00:04:53,260
I mean, it had to be.

27
00:04:53,314 --> 00:04:57,182
Why else would they have dropped
that thingamabob right over us?

28
00:04:57,235 --> 00:05:00,070
- Then why wouldn't they just land?
- I don't know,

29
00:05:00,113 --> 00:05:04,276
but this is tracking the chopper. They
want us to know where they're going.

30
00:05:04,325 --> 00:05:07,492
It's a phone, right?
Can't we just call?

31
00:05:09,414 --> 00:05:10,991
Well?

32
00:05:14,127 --> 00:05:16,119
Don't try anything stupid.

33
00:05:16,170 --> 00:05:17,285
Understood.

34
00:05:26,431 --> 00:05:28,672
- <i>Put her down over there.</i>
- Is that them?

35
00:05:28,725 --> 00:05:31,429
<i>You sure?</i>
<i>We're still five klicks from the site.</i>

36
00:05:31,477 --> 00:05:33,553
<i>I said put her down, Frank!</i>

37
00:05:33,604 --> 00:05:36,392
<i>Gear up. We hit the ground,</i>
<i>we deploy to the Orchid.</i>

38
00:05:36,441 --> 00:05:39,525
<i>Heads down. Let's do this.</i>

39
00:05:41,029 --> 00:05:43,650
- You know what the Orchid is?
- No.

40
00:05:43,698 --> 00:05:46,533
I didn't hear Desmond or Sayid either.

41
00:05:47,535 --> 00:05:48,614
Kate.

42
00:05:52,790 --> 00:05:55,246
- You wanna take a walk?
- Absolutely.

43
00:05:55,293 --> 00:05:57,700
- I'll get the guns. You get some water.
- OK.

44
00:05:59,047 --> 00:06:02,001
You can't possibly be serious.

45
00:06:02,050 --> 00:06:04,042
- You just had surgery.
- I'll be fine.

46
00:06:04,093 --> 00:06:07,011
- If your sutures rip, you won't be.
- I can't sit around

47
00:06:07,055 --> 00:06:09,759
- Recovery is not sitting around!
- I have to.

48
00:06:09,807 --> 00:06:13,259
- Why?
- Because I promised those people

49
00:06:13,311 --> 00:06:16,514
that I would get them off this island.

50
00:06:17,565 --> 00:06:19,854
Don't bleed to death, Jack.

51
00:06:20,651 --> 00:06:22,893
I'll see you in a couple hours.

52
00:06:28,868 --> 00:06:30,659
Daniel?

53
00:06:30,703 --> 00:06:33,159
- What's wrong?
- Did you hear what he said?

54
00:06:33,206 --> 00:06:36,788
They're going to the Orchid.
Using the secondary protocol.

55
00:06:36,834 --> 00:06:39,076
What are you talking about?

56
00:06:47,512 --> 00:06:50,216
We have to get off this island...

57
00:06:51,516 --> 00:06:53,389
...right now.

58
00:07:11,786 --> 00:07:14,703
We're catching up.
The chopper must have landed.

59
00:07:14,747 --> 00:07:17,321
Why don't you take a break?

60
00:07:34,809 --> 00:07:36,268
You're bleeding.

61
00:07:36,853 --> 00:07:39,474
No, I'm not bleeding.
I'm... I'm suppurating.

62
00:07:39,522 --> 00:07:45,228
It's discharge. My body is just fighting
an infection around the stitches.

63
00:07:45,278 --> 00:07:49,655
You know when most people are lying
and they can't look you in the eye?

64
00:07:50,158 --> 00:07:52,031
You do the exact opposite.

65
00:08:08,343 --> 00:08:09,718
Hey, long time no see.

66
00:08:12,263 --> 00:08:14,801
Who are you talkin' to
up there, Genghis?

67
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:32,444
Where's Claire?

68
00:08:36,454 --> 00:08:37,533
We lost her.

69
00:08:37,872 --> 00:08:39,200
You what?

70
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:42,788
She walked off
in the middle of the night.

71
00:08:43,127 --> 00:08:46,413
We looked for her for a day,
but she was just gone.

72
00:08:46,464 --> 00:08:49,169
I was hoping maybe she
went back to the beach.

73
00:08:49,217 --> 00:08:50,925
She didn't.

74
00:08:53,221 --> 00:08:55,842
What are you all doing out here?

75
00:08:56,224 --> 00:08:57,552
What is that phone for?

76
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:00,636
Chopper flew over the beach.
Someone tossed this out.

77
00:09:00,687 --> 00:09:02,845
I think it must have been Sayid.

78
00:09:02,897 --> 00:09:05,815
Well, you better hope it ain't Sayid.

79
00:09:05,858 --> 00:09:09,108
If he's with those animals
who blew up half of New Otherton,

80
00:09:09,153 --> 00:09:11,146
you do not wanna tussle with 'em.

81
00:09:11,823 --> 00:09:13,103
They tried to kill you?

82
00:09:14,117 --> 00:09:16,240
Just like Locke said they would.

83
00:09:19,622 --> 00:09:23,073
So, what, we're supposed
to just turn around and hide?

84
00:09:23,126 --> 00:09:26,127
'Cause it seems like
that didn't work so well for you.

85
00:09:26,170 --> 00:09:30,464
Didn't you just do the "run through
the jungle with a walkie" plan?

86
00:09:30,508 --> 00:09:33,379
That helicopter
is our only way off this island.

87
00:09:33,428 --> 00:09:36,298
What's with you
and gettin' off the island?

88
00:09:36,347 --> 00:09:39,965
Stop it! You two
fighting each other now?

89
00:09:44,522 --> 00:09:47,891
Look, I put Sayid and Desmond
on that chopper.

90
00:09:47,942 --> 00:09:52,022
It was my call. It's my responsibility.

91
00:09:53,823 --> 00:09:57,192
I'm going after it,
whether they're on it or not.

92
00:09:59,078 --> 00:10:01,450
- You can all head back to the beach.
- Jack.

93
00:10:01,497 --> 00:10:04,332
No, no, no. You can't go by yourself.

94
00:10:06,544 --> 00:10:09,117
Just take care of the baby, OK?

95
00:10:17,263 --> 00:10:19,671
That son of a bitch is stubborn.

96
00:10:19,724 --> 00:10:22,927
Hold up! You don't get to die alone.

97
00:10:27,648 --> 00:10:30,140
Based on the location of the wreckage,

98
00:10:30,193 --> 00:10:34,605
our best estimate
of the crash site is here.

99
00:10:34,655 --> 00:10:36,150
From there, the survivors

100
00:10:36,199 --> 00:10:41,276
were carried
by the ocean's current to here.

101
00:10:41,329 --> 00:10:46,620
An uninhabited island in
the Lesser Sunda Islands called Membata.

102
00:10:46,668 --> 00:10:48,956
As you all read in your briefing books,

103
00:10:49,003 --> 00:10:52,253
on day 103, a typhoon

104
00:10:52,298 --> 00:10:55,465
washed up the remnants
of an Indonesian fishing boat,

105
00:10:55,510 --> 00:10:59,128
including basic supplies
and a survival raft.

106
00:10:59,180 --> 00:11:03,392
On day 108, the remaining six survivors,

107
00:11:03,434 --> 00:11:09,223
including Ms Austen's baby, which she
gave birth to on the island of Membata,

108
00:11:09,273 --> 00:11:14,019
used this raft to journey here,
an island called Sumba.

109
00:11:14,070 --> 00:11:17,818
They then came ashore near
a village called Manukangga.

110
00:11:17,865 --> 00:11:21,697
This photo was taken
by the local fishermen who found them.

111
00:11:22,161 --> 00:11:24,284
Once it was discovered who they were,

112
00:11:24,330 --> 00:11:27,865
they were then transported
to Honolulu by the U.S. Coast Guard.

113
00:11:27,917 --> 00:11:32,959
As you can imagine, this has been
an extraordinarily trying experience.

114
00:11:33,006 --> 00:11:36,339
They have, however,
agreed to answer a few questions,

115
00:11:36,384 --> 00:11:41,010
so, ladies and gentlemen,
the survivors of Oceanic 815.

116
00:11:42,974 --> 00:11:44,883
Dr Shephard! Dr Shephard!

117
00:11:44,934 --> 00:11:48,220
Can you tell us what it was like
when the plane hit the ocean,

118
00:11:48,271 --> 00:11:49,813
how you survived?

119
00:11:54,152 --> 00:11:58,944
It... it all happened really fast.
I remember the impact.

120
00:11:59,157 --> 00:12:02,158
I remember the plane
filling up with water.

121
00:12:02,994 --> 00:12:06,445
A group of us got to the emergency door

122
00:12:06,497 --> 00:12:09,249
and got out before it went down.

123
00:12:09,292 --> 00:12:12,791
And those of you who survived
you swam to the island?

124
00:12:13,629 --> 00:12:19,051
No. We had cushions,
we had some life jackets.

125
00:12:19,093 --> 00:12:23,008
We were in the water for over a day
before the current took us in.

126
00:12:23,056 --> 00:12:25,463
By then, there were
only eight of us left.

127
00:12:26,684 --> 00:12:28,677
What happened to the other three?

128
00:12:28,728 --> 00:12:31,515
One of them, his name is Boone Carlyle,

129
00:12:31,564 --> 00:12:35,811
suffered tremendous internal injuries
and died a few days after the crash.

130
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:38,896
A woman, Libby,

131
00:12:38,946 --> 00:12:41,319
she didn't make it through
the first week.

132
00:12:41,366 --> 00:12:43,821
Charlie Pace,

133
00:12:43,868 --> 00:12:48,032
he drowned a few weeks
before we were able to leave.

134
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:51,914
Mr Reyes, you were worth

135
00:12:51,959 --> 00:12:55,874
more than $150 million
at the time of your..."death".

136
00:12:55,922 --> 00:12:58,876
How does it feel to know
you'll get that money back?

137
00:12:58,925 --> 00:13:01,416
I don't want it back. Any of it.

138
00:13:01,886 --> 00:13:04,128
That money was bad luck.

139
00:13:08,976 --> 00:13:11,349
Can somebody translate that?

140
00:13:13,147 --> 00:13:17,145
She asked me if my husband was one
of the people who died on the island.

141
00:13:26,077 --> 00:13:30,822
The answer is no.
He never made it off the plane.

142
00:13:30,873 --> 00:13:33,709
Are you aware of the situation
in Iraq, Mr Jarrah?

143
00:13:33,751 --> 00:13:35,578
Do you have any plans to return?

144
00:13:37,088 --> 00:13:39,164
There is nothing for me in Iraq.

145
00:13:39,215 --> 00:13:42,714
And Mr Shephard, now that
you are home, what are your plans.

146
00:13:43,594 --> 00:13:46,168
I haven't really thought
too much about it.

147
00:13:47,682 --> 00:13:49,390
My father died in Sydney.

148
00:13:49,434 --> 00:13:53,182
I was bringing him home for the funeral
when the plane crashed.

149
00:13:54,439 --> 00:13:56,562
Even though the body is...

150
00:13:57,984 --> 00:13:59,811
I'd like to put him to rest.

151
00:13:59,861 --> 00:14:00,940
Ms Austen?

152
00:14:03,031 --> 00:14:05,604
What was it like
giving birth on the island?

153
00:14:06,284 --> 00:14:07,482
Scary.

154
00:14:07,910 --> 00:14:11,410
Your son, Aaron? How old is he?

155
00:14:11,914 --> 00:14:13,872
Just a little over five weeks.

156
00:14:13,916 --> 00:14:16,490
So that would've made you
six months pregnant

157
00:14:16,544 --> 00:14:20,079
when the U.S. Marshal Service
apprehended you in Australia

158
00:14:20,131 --> 00:14:22,420
for an outstanding murder warrant?

159
00:14:22,467 --> 00:14:26,844
I'm afraid Ms Austen's legal issue
is off the table. Next question.

160
00:14:26,888 --> 00:14:29,593
Mr Jarrah, given
the amazing circumstances

161
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:32,511
surrounding the survival of you six,
is it possible

162
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:37,139
there are any other survivors
from the crash yet to be discovered?

163
00:14:37,190 --> 00:14:39,313
No. Absolutely not.

164
00:14:47,283 --> 00:14:48,777
You did good.

165
00:14:52,955 --> 00:14:54,118
Mr Jarrah?

166
00:14:55,792 --> 00:14:57,250
There's a woman outside.

167
00:14:57,293 --> 00:15:00,543
Says she knows you but wasn't
on our list of family members.

168
00:15:00,588 --> 00:15:03,375
Her name is Noor Abed Jaseem.

169
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:25,695
Nadia?

170
00:15:29,951 --> 00:15:31,825
Nadia.

171
00:16:07,238 --> 00:16:09,065
Over here.

172
00:16:12,201 --> 00:16:13,612
Sayid!

173
00:16:13,661 --> 00:16:15,072
Where's Desmond?

174
00:16:15,121 --> 00:16:19,332
He's fine, on the freighter. I'm going
to take people back, six at a time.

175
00:16:19,375 --> 00:16:23,207
We have to go right now, before
the helicopter gets back to the boat.

176
00:16:23,254 --> 00:16:26,540
Why do we have to go to the boat
before the chopper gets back?

177
00:16:26,591 --> 00:16:31,134
Because the men on that helicopter
have every intention of killing us all.

178
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:33,759
What?

179
00:16:33,806 --> 00:16:36,807
Jack and Kate
just went running after it.

180
00:16:43,733 --> 00:16:46,900
So when is someone
gonna tell me where we're going?

181
00:16:46,944 --> 00:16:50,064
We're going to a place
called the Orchid, Hugo.

182
00:16:50,114 --> 00:16:51,395
What's that?

183
00:16:51,449 --> 00:16:53,406
It's a greenhouse.

184
00:16:53,951 --> 00:16:57,071
And why are we going
to a greenhouse, exactly?

185
00:16:57,121 --> 00:16:59,992
You heard John.
We're going to move the island.

186
00:17:00,625 --> 00:17:03,116
Right. And how are we gonna do that?

187
00:17:03,586 --> 00:17:05,626
Very carefully.

188
00:17:05,672 --> 00:17:08,838
If you could move the island
whenever you wanted,

189
00:17:08,883 --> 00:17:12,584
why didn't you just do it before
the psychos with the guns got here?

190
00:17:12,637 --> 00:17:15,804
Because doing it is
both dangerous and unpredictable.

191
00:17:17,850 --> 00:17:19,843
It's a measure of last resort.

192
00:17:20,103 --> 00:17:21,301
Awesome.

193
00:17:39,372 --> 00:17:41,080
Allow me.

194
00:18:00,268 --> 00:18:02,307
May I have that mirror, please?

195
00:18:04,272 --> 00:18:06,146
You know those are 15 years old.

196
00:18:18,077 --> 00:18:20,948
- What are you doing, dude?
- Communicating.

197
00:18:22,957 --> 00:18:24,582
Communicating with who?

198
00:18:28,254 --> 00:18:29,796
Who do you think?

199
00:18:41,476 --> 00:18:43,764
All right. Now we can go.

200
00:18:43,811 --> 00:18:46,598
Wait, what was that?
What did you tell them?

201
00:18:46,647 --> 00:18:49,399
None of your business, John.

202
00:18:59,535 --> 00:19:03,580
If you wanna run off in the jungle
after that chopper, you should do that.

203
00:19:03,623 --> 00:19:06,196
In the meantime we need
to get them off this island.

204
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:08,243
If I can catch up to Jack and Kate...

205
00:19:08,294 --> 00:19:11,378
I can start ferrying people now,
get them there safely.

206
00:19:11,422 --> 00:19:15,123
By time you get back, I can have
most of these people on our boat.

207
00:19:22,433 --> 00:19:25,636
I trust you know the bearing.
You'd better get going.

208
00:19:25,687 --> 00:19:26,885
Thank you.

209
00:19:26,938 --> 00:19:29,974
All right, first group in the raft.
We can fit six!

210
00:19:30,024 --> 00:19:34,852
OK, OK, hold on.
Sun is pregnant. She should go first.

211
00:19:40,076 --> 00:19:43,279
Sayid? What are you doing here?

212
00:19:43,329 --> 00:19:44,527
Jack thought...

213
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:47,285
That's why I'm going after him.
How far ahead is he?

214
00:19:47,333 --> 00:19:50,619
I don't know. He's with Sawyer.
I left them about an hour ago.

215
00:19:50,670 --> 00:19:53,505
Jack's got a sat-phone,
headed for the helicopter.

216
00:19:53,589 --> 00:19:54,704
I can track them.

217
00:19:57,468 --> 00:20:01,632
Look, you are not gonna catch up
to them unless I go with you.

218
00:20:01,681 --> 00:20:03,508
Then let's go.

219
00:20:04,809 --> 00:20:06,802
- Sun?
- Where's Claire?

220
00:20:06,853 --> 00:20:08,561
- Get Aaron to the boat.
- What?

221
00:20:08,604 --> 00:20:13,480
I'm sorry. Just... I'll see you there.
Just keep him safe!

222
00:20:17,905 --> 00:20:20,823
All right, this is just
the first trip. Here we go.

223
00:23:41,275 --> 00:23:43,102
Mom?

224
00:23:44,612 --> 00:23:46,237
Dad?

225
00:23:51,703 --> 00:23:54,324
Mr Tron? Lady Tron?

226
00:24:12,056 --> 00:24:13,598
Hello?

227
00:24:29,657 --> 00:24:33,322
Why am I doing this?
Why am I doing this?

228
00:24:34,746 --> 00:24:36,156
Why am I doing this?

229
00:24:36,497 --> 00:24:38,371
Surprise!

230
00:24:38,416 --> 00:24:40,824
Happy birthday!

231
00:24:43,254 --> 00:24:46,705
Hugo, what are you doing with that?

232
00:24:46,758 --> 00:24:50,209
I don't know, I thought
there was a prowler or something.

233
00:24:50,261 --> 00:24:52,052
Jesus Christ is not a weapon.

234
00:24:52,347 --> 00:24:55,431
OK. Enjoy your party.

235
00:25:09,197 --> 00:25:10,940
Happy birthday, Hurley.

236
00:25:11,949 --> 00:25:13,230
- Hey, Kate.
- Hey.

237
00:25:13,284 --> 00:25:15,193
- Hey, little buddy!
- Say hi.

238
00:25:15,244 --> 00:25:17,570
Jack's running late.

239
00:25:17,622 --> 00:25:19,413
Happy Birthday, Hugo!

240
00:25:19,457 --> 00:25:21,165
Wow, you guys are here!

241
00:25:23,461 --> 00:25:25,169
Interesting choice of theme.

242
00:25:25,213 --> 00:25:28,167
Yeah, mom really doesn't get it, dude.

243
00:25:28,216 --> 00:25:30,339
Hey, how's everybody doing?

244
00:25:30,385 --> 00:25:34,596
What're you talking about?
Building a fire or hunting boars?

245
00:25:34,639 --> 00:25:35,753
Guess not.

246
00:25:35,807 --> 00:25:38,891
Listen, do you mind excusing us
for a little while?

247
00:25:38,935 --> 00:25:41,640
I wanna show you your birthday present.

248
00:25:43,064 --> 00:25:44,143
Bye-bye now.

249
00:25:44,190 --> 00:25:47,108
- I don't want anything.
- Hugo, it's your birthday.

250
00:25:47,151 --> 00:25:49,477
- Gotta get somethin'.
- Not with the money.

251
00:25:49,529 --> 00:25:52,020
- I don't want anything from the money.
- Relax.

252
00:25:52,073 --> 00:25:54,611
I got you this before
you gave us the money.

253
00:25:55,660 --> 00:25:57,451
Check it out.

254
00:26:03,918 --> 00:26:04,997
You fixed it.

255
00:26:05,044 --> 00:26:07,369
Yeah. After the crash,

256
00:26:07,422 --> 00:26:11,550
I worked on it as a memorial to you.

257
00:26:11,592 --> 00:26:14,712
When I was fixing it up,
it was almost like I was with you.

258
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:18,847
But now you're back. And it's all yours.

259
00:26:19,308 --> 00:26:21,218
Wanna take her for a little spin?

260
00:26:38,119 --> 00:26:39,530
Something wrong, son?

261
00:26:39,579 --> 00:26:41,203
Is this some kind of joke?

262
00:26:42,123 --> 00:26:46,121
- What're you talking about?
- Four, eight, 15, 16, 23, 42.

263
00:26:46,169 --> 00:26:48,126
Did you do this?

264
00:26:48,171 --> 00:26:49,416
Do what?

265
00:26:49,464 --> 00:26:53,164
Those are the numbers! There!
The numbers I won the lottery with!

266
00:26:53,217 --> 00:26:54,760
Wow, what a coincidence.

267
00:26:54,802 --> 00:26:59,595
No! No, not a coincidence. I don't
want this! I don't want any of it!

268
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:01,882
Hugo, wait a minute. Hugo. Son!

269
00:27:04,270 --> 00:27:08,932
Hugo. Hugo, come on,
where are you going? Hugo!

270
00:27:10,193 --> 00:27:14,321
OK. So let's say this greenhouse place
does what you say.

271
00:27:14,364 --> 00:27:17,697
And I get it,
it's really dangerous and unpredictable.

272
00:27:17,742 --> 00:27:22,036
But suppose somehow it works,
and we move the island.

273
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:24,571
Doesn't that mean the dudes
with guns move too?

274
00:27:24,624 --> 00:27:26,083
Yes, I suppose they would.

275
00:27:26,125 --> 00:27:28,201
Isn't that, you know, a problem?

276
00:27:28,252 --> 00:27:30,079
I'm working on it.

277
00:27:30,129 --> 00:27:32,620
Well, what about me?
I still wanna get off it!

278
00:27:32,674 --> 00:27:35,343
I'm afraid it's a little late
for that, Hugo.

279
00:27:45,311 --> 00:27:47,719
May I have the binoculars, please?

280
00:27:49,357 --> 00:27:52,026
You might want to get
down lower to the ground.

281
00:27:52,068 --> 00:27:53,942
And why might we want to do that?

282
00:27:54,570 --> 00:27:56,777
Because we're at the Orchid.

283
00:28:09,544 --> 00:28:12,117
What are we waiting for?

284
00:28:12,171 --> 00:28:14,460
We're waiting
because Charles Widmore,

285
00:28:14,507 --> 00:28:17,378
the man trying to capture me
and kill the rest of you,

286
00:28:17,427 --> 00:28:21,294
knows about this place
and knows what we need is inside.

287
00:28:21,347 --> 00:28:26,305
I thought you said you had no idea
why he was trying to find the island.

288
00:28:26,352 --> 00:28:29,353
- I wasn't being entirely truthful.
- Yeah.

289
00:28:29,397 --> 00:28:31,852
When are you ever entirely truthful?

290
00:28:32,984 --> 00:28:34,858
You need to see this.

291
00:28:37,822 --> 00:28:39,067
What am I looking for?

292
00:28:39,115 --> 00:28:42,863
Look over there, on the left side.
Watch the plants at the back.

293
00:28:43,161 --> 00:28:44,703
I don't see any...

294
00:28:50,460 --> 00:28:52,369
They're already here.

295
00:29:17,236 --> 00:29:18,612
Hey, we're back!

296
00:29:30,583 --> 00:29:31,662
Where's Sayid?

297
00:29:31,709 --> 00:29:33,702
He had to go after Jack.

298
00:29:35,004 --> 00:29:36,878
They're headed for the chopper.

299
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:43,465
- You OK?
- Yes, I'm fine. Thank you.

300
00:29:48,935 --> 00:29:51,224
I'm going back for the next group.

301
00:30:00,446 --> 00:30:01,727
Engine's fixed.

302
00:30:01,781 --> 00:30:03,655
Tell Hendricks to try it.

303
00:30:19,632 --> 00:30:21,672
OK. Engines should be working.

304
00:30:28,808 --> 00:30:30,350
Indeed they are.

305
00:30:31,561 --> 00:30:34,134
All right, well, take us to the island.

306
00:30:36,733 --> 00:30:39,271
But make sure you stay
on a bearing of 305.

307
00:30:39,318 --> 00:30:41,441
It gotta be exactly 305.

308
00:30:42,655 --> 00:30:45,989
We've got some kind of RF interference
with the Fathometer.

309
00:30:46,034 --> 00:30:47,943
I can't see the reef, mate.

310
00:30:47,994 --> 00:30:52,822
RF interference? How is that possible?
The radio room's down.

311
00:30:52,874 --> 00:30:55,791
I don't know, but something
on this boat is broadcasting.

312
00:30:55,835 --> 00:30:57,080
If we don't turn it off,

313
00:30:57,128 --> 00:31:00,295
I'm not going any closer
than five miles off the coast.

314
00:31:00,340 --> 00:31:01,715
Then I'll find it.

315
00:31:09,807 --> 00:31:11,847
Cut yourself shavin'?

316
00:31:13,436 --> 00:31:16,472
Juliet took out my appendix
a couple days ago.

317
00:31:16,814 --> 00:31:19,732
- You kidding me?
- Nope.

318
00:31:20,777 --> 00:31:22,734
Well, what else did I miss?

319
00:31:28,451 --> 00:31:29,826
We're here.

320
00:31:46,719 --> 00:31:48,427
Lapidus!

321
00:31:51,516 --> 00:31:53,176
You know this yahoo?

322
00:31:53,226 --> 00:31:55,183
- Yeah.
- Yahoo?

323
00:31:55,228 --> 00:31:59,937
This yahoo dropped that phone
on you guys so you could find me,

324
00:31:59,982 --> 00:32:01,690
and I could fly you outta here.

325
00:32:01,734 --> 00:32:05,399
So why don't you do me a favour
and get in that back compartment.

326
00:32:05,446 --> 00:32:09,314
There's a toolbox, see if you can find
something to get me outta these.

327
00:32:09,367 --> 00:32:10,446
You heard the man.

328
00:32:10,910 --> 00:32:14,694
Can I get you boys a nice cold glass
of lemonade while I'm back there?

329
00:32:14,747 --> 00:32:16,372
Where are Desmond and Sayid?

330
00:32:16,416 --> 00:32:18,741
They were smart enough
to stay on the boat.

331
00:32:18,793 --> 00:32:21,035
Right now that's the safest place to be.

332
00:32:23,339 --> 00:32:27,040
When the boys I brought over here
come stompin' out of this jungle,

333
00:32:27,093 --> 00:32:30,628
- you're gonna want to be long gone.
- Where'd they go?

334
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:34,298
Up by some greenhouse. Perched
up there waiting to snatch Linus.

335
00:32:35,184 --> 00:32:37,473
We cut you free,
you'll fly us out of here?

336
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:40,058
- Hell, yeah.
- Hang on, Shaggy.

337
00:32:40,106 --> 00:32:42,145
The hit squad's grabbing Ben Linus?

338
00:32:42,191 --> 00:32:44,231
I don't see what's gonna stop 'em.

339
00:32:44,277 --> 00:32:47,147
And what are they gonna do
to the people with him?

340
00:32:47,196 --> 00:32:48,821
Nothing good.

341
00:32:51,451 --> 00:32:52,826
Hugo's with Ben.

342
00:32:56,289 --> 00:32:58,163
Son of a bitch.

343
00:32:59,709 --> 00:33:01,251
About ten months ago,

344
00:33:01,294 --> 00:33:04,745
I wrote what I wanted to say
at my father's funeral

345
00:33:04,797 --> 00:33:08,629
on the back of a cocktail napkin
at the Sydney airport.

346
00:33:10,428 --> 00:33:13,761
I don't remember what I wrote,
but whatever it was,

347
00:33:13,806 --> 00:33:15,598
he would've hated it.

348
00:33:16,934 --> 00:33:19,307
My father couldn't stand eulogies.

349
00:33:19,896 --> 00:33:23,561
"The only good thing about a wake
is the free booze", he'd say.

350
00:33:26,486 --> 00:33:30,649
Not much of a wake because
I won't even be able to bury him.

351
00:33:32,825 --> 00:33:37,950
So, what I want to say
is not for my father.

352
00:33:37,997 --> 00:33:39,622
It's for me.

353
00:33:46,506 --> 00:33:48,214
Goodbye, Dad.

354
00:33:50,176 --> 00:33:51,551
I loved you.

355
00:33:55,348 --> 00:33:57,008
I miss you.

356
00:34:01,479 --> 00:34:03,721
Thanks very much for coming.

357
00:34:03,773 --> 00:34:05,896
Thank you for coming. Thanks.

358
00:34:06,693 --> 00:34:08,981
- I'll see you back at the house?
- Yeah.

359
00:34:09,946 --> 00:34:12,733
- I love you, sweetheart.
- I love you, Mom.

360
00:34:14,701 --> 00:34:16,574
I'm so glad you're home.

361
00:34:16,869 --> 00:34:18,245
- See you soon.
- OK.

362
00:34:28,631 --> 00:34:30,588
You did that well.

363
00:34:31,843 --> 00:34:33,171
I had a lot of practise.

364
00:34:37,390 --> 00:34:40,675
Excuse me. May I have a word with you?

365
00:34:43,021 --> 00:34:44,563
Mr Shephard...

366
00:34:46,649 --> 00:34:48,725
...I'm very sorry for you loss.

367
00:34:49,652 --> 00:34:50,933
Thank you.

368
00:34:52,739 --> 00:34:54,233
How did you know my father?

369
00:34:55,908 --> 00:35:00,535
I believe I'm the reason
he was in Australia when he died.

370
00:35:02,248 --> 00:35:04,454
I'm sorry. I don't understand.

371
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:07,786
- Why would he have come to see you?
- Oh, he...

372
00:35:08,087 --> 00:35:11,041
He didn't come to see me.

373
00:35:11,090 --> 00:35:14,091
I was still in the hospital.
I never saw him.

374
00:35:17,597 --> 00:35:19,969
He came to see his daughter.

375
00:35:22,352 --> 00:35:25,767
My daughter, Mr Shephard.

376
00:35:29,108 --> 00:35:33,486
- My father didn't have a daughter.
- Yes. He did.

377
00:35:34,530 --> 00:35:37,567
If you don't believe me,
check his phone records.

378
00:35:40,370 --> 00:35:45,577
Would you like to know the strangest
thing about all this, Mr Shephard?

379
00:35:47,877 --> 00:35:50,831
My daughter was on your plane too.

380
00:35:52,215 --> 00:35:55,169
She was on flight 815.

381
00:35:58,638 --> 00:36:02,221
You were in the air for six hours.

382
00:36:02,266 --> 00:36:05,517
Probably just a few rows from her.

383
00:36:05,561 --> 00:36:08,313
And you never even knew
she was your sister.

384
00:36:11,317 --> 00:36:17,023
She was one of the ones who died
when your plane hit the water.

385
00:36:20,827 --> 00:36:24,243
Her name was... Claire.

386
00:36:31,337 --> 00:36:34,955
I didn't mean to burden you
with this, but...

387
00:36:35,008 --> 00:36:37,047
...you needed to know.

388
00:36:38,803 --> 00:36:43,346
I'm... sorry for your loss.

389
00:36:57,613 --> 00:36:59,191
Your son is beautiful.

390
00:37:02,744 --> 00:37:04,570
Thank you.

391
00:37:16,424 --> 00:37:19,627
I don't understand.
How did you get back to New York?

392
00:37:20,762 --> 00:37:24,925
Walt and I... we took Ben's boat

393
00:37:24,974 --> 00:37:28,557
and followed his bearing.
A couple of days we came to a island,

394
00:37:28,603 --> 00:37:31,272
you know, with people. I sold the boat,

395
00:37:31,314 --> 00:37:34,101
and we hopped a cargo ferry
back to the States.

396
00:37:34,734 --> 00:37:37,106
We didn't tell anybody who we were.

397
00:37:37,612 --> 00:37:39,854
And now you're working for Ben?

398
00:37:41,574 --> 00:37:44,528
I do not work for Ben.

399
00:37:46,704 --> 00:37:51,081
I'm trying to make up for what I did.
I'm trying to help you out here.

400
00:37:52,627 --> 00:37:55,996
- Translate what I said.
- I understand.

401
00:37:57,548 --> 00:38:00,170
Hey, Michael! I need you! Now!

402
00:38:08,518 --> 00:38:10,142
Oh, my God.

403
00:38:18,653 --> 00:38:20,195
Now!

404
00:38:37,839 --> 00:38:39,297
What's the matter?

405
00:38:42,427 --> 00:38:44,633
These aren't Jack or Sawyer.

406
00:38:44,679 --> 00:38:47,252
They're different tracks, fresh.

407
00:38:48,224 --> 00:38:51,225
And they're doubling back behind us.

408
00:38:54,981 --> 00:38:57,104
Whoever you are, come out now!

409
00:39:02,405 --> 00:39:05,940
All right. All right, let's just relax.

410
00:39:06,909 --> 00:39:08,867
- All right, let's relax.
- Stop!

411
00:39:08,911 --> 00:39:10,370
- Stop!
- Put the guns down.

412
00:39:10,413 --> 00:39:13,082
- I said stop!
- Please, just drop your guns.

413
00:39:13,124 --> 00:39:14,452
Take one more step...

414
00:39:29,515 --> 00:39:31,638
I said drop your guns.

415
00:39:41,611 --> 00:39:45,655
I see two of them,
but not the one who killed Alex.

416
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:47,485
He's there.

417
00:39:50,453 --> 00:39:52,244
Hold onto that for me, will you?

418
00:39:52,288 --> 00:39:53,533
What?

419
00:39:53,581 --> 00:39:58,290
Listen to me very carefully, John.
I'm not gonna have time to repeat this.

420
00:39:58,336 --> 00:40:02,084
You're gonna go into that greenhouse
through that hole there.

421
00:40:02,131 --> 00:40:05,714
Once inside you're gonna turn left,
go about 20 paces until you see

422
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:07,634
a patch of anthuriums on your left.

423
00:40:07,679 --> 00:40:10,845
They're in an alcove against
the north wall. Face that wall,

424
00:40:10,890 --> 00:40:15,018
reach down with your left hand, find
a switch that activates the elevator.

425
00:40:15,687 --> 00:40:18,771
The elevator takes
you down to the actual Orchid Station.

426
00:40:18,815 --> 00:40:21,222
- Whoa, wait, what?
- OK.

427
00:40:21,275 --> 00:40:23,766
Maybe I missed
the part where you explained

428
00:40:23,820 --> 00:40:27,023
what I'm supposed to do
about the armed men inside.

429
00:40:27,073 --> 00:40:28,401
I'll take care of them.

430
00:40:28,449 --> 00:40:30,656
And how the hell are you gonna do that?

431
00:40:31,786 --> 00:40:34,455
How many times
do I have to tell you, John?

432
00:40:34,497 --> 00:40:35,908
I always have a plan.

433
00:40:41,879 --> 00:40:43,587
Ben.

434
00:40:43,631 --> 00:40:44,794
Ben!

435
00:41:59,290 --> 00:42:02,161
My name is Benjamin Linus.

436
00:42:02,210 --> 00:42:04,498
I believe you're looking for me.
