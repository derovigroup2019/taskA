1
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:28,950
What's that?

2
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:31,200
Cheat sheet Faraday drew for me.

3
00:00:31,210 --> 00:00:33,270
You don't know where your boat is?

4
00:00:33,790 --> 00:00:35,700
I know where it is.

5
00:00:48,860 --> 00:00:50,990
Why are you flying
directly into the thunderhead?

6
00:00:51,010 --> 00:00:54,200
Why don't you just sit
back and let me do my job, huh?

7
00:01:02,230 --> 00:01:03,930
Is that Penelope?

8
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:08,860
She told Charlie she didn't
know about this boat, correct?

9
00:01:08,870 --> 00:01:09,910
Aye.

10
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:12,220
What do you expect to
find when you get there?

11
00:01:12,230 --> 00:01:13,820
Answers.

12
00:01:40,090 --> 00:01:41,640
Hold on!

13
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:47,030
On your soddin' feet!

14
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,810
Move! Move! Move!

15
00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:54,330
What are you waiting for, hume?

16
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:01,290
What's the matter, hume?

17
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:03,900
Did you not hear me?

18
00:02:03,910 --> 00:02:06,440
I'm sorry, sir. I was--I
was having a dream, sir.

19
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:07,920
You were having a dream, were you?

20
00:02:07,930 --> 00:02:09,460
And what were you dreaming about that

21
00:02:09,470 --> 00:02:13,800
it took you so sodding
long to get to your mark?

22
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:21,600
I was in a helicopter, sir, and
there was a storm, sir.

23
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:23,780
And...

24
00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:26,470
I don't remember the rest, sir.

25
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:31,000
Well, at least it was a
bloody military dream.

26
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:35,050
Right! All of ya!

27
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:37,910
In the yard! Four minutes!

28
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:42,700
And you can thank private hume
for having to do it in double-time.

29
00:02:42,710 --> 00:02:43,580
Move!

30
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:45,420
- One, two, three!
- Three!

31
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:47,340
- One, two, three!
- Four!

32
00:02:47,350 --> 00:02:49,340
- One, two, three!
- Five.

33
00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:51,660
100 Crunches!

34
00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:54,040
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

35
00:02:54,830 --> 00:02:56,640
One! Two! Three...

36
00:02:56,650 --> 00:02:58,950
I hope your dream was worth this, mate.

37
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:01,270
Sorry, pal. It's just...

38
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:03,480
I've never had a dream that
was so vivid. It was--

39
00:03:03,490 --> 00:03:05,060
it was like I was actually there.

40
00:03:05,070 --> 00:03:07,250
Have you got something to say, hume?

41
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:10,510
I asked you a question!

42
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:15,200
We're almost through it.

43
00:03:15,210 --> 00:03:17,230
I see daylight.

44
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:24,130
What do you think you're doing?

45
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:26,750
Desmond, are you all right?

46
00:03:27,350 --> 00:03:29,280
Who are you?

47
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:31,980
How do you know my name?!

48
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:38,900
Here you go.

49
00:03:44,650 --> 00:03:47,690
All right, they took off a day ago.

50
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:48,940
Why haven't we heard from 'em?

51
00:03:48,950 --> 00:03:53,090
I'm gonna tell you again, as I have been
telling you all night, doctor, I don't know!

52
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:55,950
You heard the same thing as
I did when we called the boat.

53
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:57,220
What makes you think I know anything?

54
00:03:57,230 --> 00:03:59,830
Because you're not worried.

55
00:04:00,190 --> 00:04:00,880
Excuse me?

56
00:04:00,890 --> 00:04:02,330
Your boat's 40 Miles off the coast.

57
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:05,290
It should've taken 'em, what,20
minutes to get there?

58
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:07,550
So why aren't you worried?

59
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:12,220
Well, should I wring my hands together
and whisper a prayer on their behalf?

60
00:04:12,230 --> 00:04:13,540
Come on.

61
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:17,110
Maybe we should
just-- just tell 'em.

62
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:20,390
- Tell us what?
- Dan...

63
00:04:21,090 --> 00:04:23,570
Let's not confuse anyone.

64
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:24,700
Well...

65
00:04:24,710 --> 00:04:29,480
Daniel, maybe if you talk real
slow, we'll be able to follow.

66
00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:37,380
Your perception of how long
your friends have been gone...

67
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:42,960
It's not necessarily how long
they've actually been gone.

68
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:44,550
What does that mean?

69
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,990
This is a mistake.

70
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:49,400
It'll be fine. It'll be fine.

71
00:04:49,410 --> 00:04:54,090
As long as Frank flew on the bearings
that I gave him, if he stayed on it, it...

72
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:55,300
It'll be fine.

73
00:04:55,310 --> 00:04:57,590
And what if he didn't?

74
00:04:58,460 --> 00:05:01,740
Then there might be side effects.

75
00:05:04,030 --> 00:05:05,350
We're at 2,000 feet. Sit down!

76
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:07,230
- What am I doing here?
- What the hell's going on?

77
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:09,060
- Something's wrong with Desmond.
- How do you know my name?!

78
00:05:09,070 --> 00:05:10,090
Hold him in his seat!

79
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:11,810
- I'm trying!
- Let go of me!

80
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:12,930
Keep him away from the stick!

81
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:15,460
We'll be there in two minutes!

82
00:06:05,970 --> 00:06:06,910
What are you doing back?

83
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:07,750
Who are they?

84
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:09,850
Survivors of 815.

85
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:13,030
So you brought them here.
What the hell were you thinking?

86
00:06:14,210 --> 00:06:14,760
Where--where
am I?

87
00:06:14,770 --> 00:06:16,640
- All right, just take it easy.
- Who are you people?

88
00:06:16,650 --> 00:06:18,250
- Buddy. Okay, now, take it easy, buddy.
- Wh-what am I doing here?

89
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:20,130
- Who are you people?
- My friend is disoriented.

90
00:06:20,140 --> 00:06:21,310
Look, I'm not your friend!

91
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:25,060
I don't know you! I don't know you!

92
00:06:26,030 --> 00:06:27,260
When did he start doing this?

93
00:06:27,270 --> 00:06:28,930
He was fine when we took off.

94
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:29,870
When we hit
some weather--

95
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:33,010
hey, Faraday told me as long
as I stayed on the vector--

96
00:06:36,970 --> 00:06:39,020
What's your name, my friend?

97
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:40,710
Sayid.

98
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:41,850
Okay, Sayid.

99
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:44,130
Look, we're gonna take your
buddy down to the sick bay, okay?

100
00:06:44,140 --> 00:06:45,150
I'm going with him.

101
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:48,390
Let our doctor look at him
first, then you can come down.

102
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:51,600
You got my word on that, okay?

103
00:06:58,920 --> 00:06:59,660
All right.

104
00:06:59,670 --> 00:07:02,210
Hey, listen to me--
th-this is a mistake, right?

105
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:05,330
- I don't know these people. I don't know these people.
- No, no, no. Oh, no, no, I understand.

106
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:06,910
No, but this is wrong!

107
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:09,670
I'm not supposed to be here.

108
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:12,440
20! 21! 22!

109
00:07:12,450 --> 00:07:15,070
- "Here"?
- "Here" what?

110
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:17,350
What the hell are you
doing on your feet?

111
00:07:18,150 --> 00:07:22,680
Are you finished with your
crunches because you want to run?

112
00:07:22,690 --> 00:07:24,380
Right! Squad!

113
00:07:24,390 --> 00:07:26,780
On your feet!

114
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:29,670
Right face!

115
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:33,640
10 Kilometers! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

116
00:07:33,650 --> 00:07:36,990
Get moving, or so help
me, I'll kill you myself.

117
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:45,710
What the hell's the matter with you, des?

118
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:48,020
If I told you, you'd think I was crazy.

119
00:07:48,370 --> 00:07:50,700
I already know you're crazy.

120
00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:56,010
This morning, when I was in
the yard doing crunches...

121
00:07:57,980 --> 00:08:00,070
I left.

122
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:02,370
What do you mean, you left?

123
00:08:03,290 --> 00:08:06,170
I was on a boat.

124
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:09,670
And then--then I was back
here, right--right where I started.

125
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:11,990
Des, if you're trying to
get tossed out of service--

126
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,150
Billy, I am telling you the truth, man.

127
00:08:16,450 --> 00:08:19,650
Who else was on this... Boat?

128
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:22,500
Anyone you recognize?

129
00:08:23,650 --> 00:08:25,690
Penny.

130
00:08:27,970 --> 00:08:29,470
There was a photo.

131
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:31,880
- Penny was in the photo.
- What?

132
00:08:31,890 --> 00:08:33,240
Oi, Des!

133
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:35,230
Where you going?

134
00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:46,260
Thanks for this morning, hume.

135
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:54,870
Watch your step.

136
00:08:55,370 --> 00:08:57,870
Watch it. Watch your step. Take it easy.

137
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:01,850
I'm not here. This...

138
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:03,680
This--this
isn't happening.

139
00:09:03,690 --> 00:09:07,440
You are here, and this is happening.

140
00:09:07,450 --> 00:09:08,840
Look, we're gonna take care of you.

141
00:09:08,850 --> 00:09:10,630
W-what am I doing here?

142
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:13,650
- It's all right. You're gonna be okay.
- I'm not supposed to be here.

143
00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:15,470
- Who are you people?
- Well...

144
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:18,400
My name is Keamy, and this is Omar.

145
00:09:18,410 --> 00:09:20,350
I'm from Vegas, and he's from Florida.

146
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:24,080
But as for where we are, I--
we last ported in Fiji.

147
00:09:24,690 --> 00:09:27,710
So at least we know we're
still in the pacific.

148
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:35,110
All right, my friend.

149
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,880
Now you just relax, okay?

150
00:09:36,890 --> 00:09:42,680
We're gonna go get the doc, and he's gonna wanna ask
you some questions to--to help us sort all this out.

151
00:09:42,690 --> 00:09:44,880
Wh-what do you mean, "sort out"?
Wait a minute. What do you mean?

152
00:09:44,890 --> 00:09:48,110
I'm not supposed to be here!
I'm not supposed to be here!

153
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:51,130
Open this door! Open this door!

154
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:05,130
It's happening to you, too, isn't it?

155
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,160
What's happening to Desmond?

156
00:10:42,170 --> 00:10:43,370
Your friends know what's wrong with him.

157
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:44,970
Well, if they do, they're
not sharing it with me.

158
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:49,240
Then perhaps you'll share how we took off
at dusk and landed in the middle of the day?

159
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:56,460
Listen, I don't know what's
happening to your buddy, all right?

160
00:10:56,470 --> 00:10:59,280
But you gotta trust
me when I tell you this.

161
00:10:59,290 --> 00:11:01,060
I am trying to help you.

162
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:03,060
You want to help me?

163
00:11:03,070 --> 00:11:04,740
Give me your phone.

164
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:07,080
Let me call my people.

165
00:11:07,090 --> 00:11:10,470
You give me that weapon, and
I'll give you this phone.

166
00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:19,350
Be quick.

167
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:23,560
Don't go trying to call Baghdad.
Those phones only call each other.

168
00:11:31,230 --> 00:11:32,250
Hello?

169
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:34,360
Jack? It's Sayid.

170
00:11:34,370 --> 00:11:36,250
I'm on the freighter.

171
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:38,040
Are you okay? Where
the hell have you been?

172
00:11:38,050 --> 00:11:42,770
Something happened during the flight, and
now Desmond's in their sick bay.

173
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:45,470
Hold on. Hold on, hold on, hold on.

174
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:47,350
All right, you're on speaker.

175
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:50,410
On the helicopter, something
happened to Desmond.

176
00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:54,310
He doesn't appear to
recognize me or know where he is.

177
00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:57,370
"Side effects"?

178
00:11:58,780 --> 00:12:01,440
Wait, your
friend, um, Desmond--has he...

179
00:12:01,450 --> 00:12:06,940
Has he recently been exposed to high
levels of radiation or electromagnetism?

180
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:11,790
Okay, look, uh, we don't know why,

181
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:16,360
but going to and coming from the
island, some people can get a little...

182
00:12:16,370 --> 00:12:18,020
Confused.

183
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:21,990
So... What? This is amnesia?

184
00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:27,690
No, this is not amnesia.

185
00:12:33,110 --> 00:12:35,020
Can you hear me?

186
00:12:35,030 --> 00:12:38,350
Are you all right? Hello?

187
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:45,300
I was just on a ferris wheel.

188
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:49,910
See, Ray?

189
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:51,970
I'm not crazy.

190
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:56,510
It's happening to him, too, Ray, and
it's gonna happen to you.

191
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:59,770
It's gonna happen to all of us.. Everyone!

192
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:01,930
Once we start heading to
that island again.

193
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:04,030
Would you please step aside?

194
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:05,580
No. No.

195
00:13:05,590 --> 00:13:06,800
Ray, no.

196
00:13:06,810 --> 00:13:08,410
I need you to relax for a minute.

197
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:10,720
No. No it's notgonna stop it, ray!

198
00:13:10,730 --> 00:13:14,280
Nothing can stop it, ray!
Nothing can stop it!

199
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:20,860
And how are you feeling?

200
00:13:20,870 --> 00:13:22,610
What the bloody hell is going on?

201
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:23,670
I understand you're disoriented.

202
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:25,870
- You're not gonna stick me with that, brother!
- I...

203
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:28,220
Don't wanna stick you with anything.

204
00:13:28,610 --> 00:13:29,220
It's okay.

205
00:13:29,230 --> 00:13:32,340
I just wanna check your eyes.

206
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:34,930
Why?

207
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:37,170
So I can help you.

208
00:13:47,670 --> 00:13:50,450
What's your name?

209
00:13:51,550 --> 00:13:53,950
Desmond.

210
00:13:54,510 --> 00:13:56,600
Desmond.

211
00:13:58,820 --> 00:14:01,880
Desmond, why don't you tell
me about the last thing you remem--

212
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:35,300
Hello?

213
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:39,210
Penny?

214
00:14:41,330 --> 00:14:43,540
What do you want, Desmond?

215
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:45,980
Um, Penny, listen, I'm, uh...

216
00:14:46,790 --> 00:14:48,800
I'm in trouble, and, uh... But I...

217
00:14:49,730 --> 00:14:52,400
I think something's happening
to me, and...

218
00:14:52,710 --> 00:14:54,880
I'm confused and... I...

219
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:57,840
I need to see you.

220
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:02,200
You broke off with me, and
then you joined the army,

221
00:15:02,210 --> 00:15:06,330
and now you call with some expectation
that I still care about you?

222
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:08,390
Yeah, I'd say you are confused, Desmond.

223
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:10,980
No, no, I'm not.
It's--it's...

224
00:15:10,990 --> 00:15:14,250
Look, I-I have got two days
leave starting tonight.

225
00:15:14,970 --> 00:15:17,670
- Can I--can I--can I
come and see you? - No!

226
00:15:17,950 --> 00:15:20,830
No, and don't bother showing up at
the flat either, 'cause I have moved.

227
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:22,580
Moved? Where?

228
00:15:22,590 --> 00:15:24,930
It doesn't matter.

229
00:15:25,310 --> 00:15:27,480
Look, Desmond, I'm going to go.

230
00:15:27,490 --> 00:15:29,150
- Please, just don't call me again.
- No, no. No, listen.

231
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:32,560
Penny, Penny, I
ne--Penny, I need you.

232
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:37,240
Did you just...

233
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:40,150
Experience something, Desmond?

234
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:43,130
What the hell, Frank?

235
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:45,450
You're not supposed to be down
here, and definitely not with him.

236
00:15:45,460 --> 00:15:47,650
Sorry, doc, but I got
Faraday calling from the island.

237
00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:50,450
- He needs to talk to the scottish guy.
- No, Faraday's not talking to my patient.

238
00:15:50,460 --> 00:15:53,150
- Now get out of here.
- But he's not your patient.

239
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:54,980
Give Desmond the phone.

240
00:15:56,150 --> 00:15:58,730
Give him the phone now!

241
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:04,040
Hello?

242
00:16:04,050 --> 00:16:06,750
Desmond? Desmond, my
name is Daniel Faraday.

243
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:11,100
We met yesterday before you took off, but I'm
guessing you don't remember that. Am I right?

244
00:16:11,110 --> 00:16:12,460
Took off? What?

245
00:16:12,470 --> 00:16:18,030
Desmond, we don't have long to talk, so I
need you to tell me what year you think it is.

246
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:21,770
What do you mean, what
year do I think--it's 1996.

247
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:26,010
All right, Desmond.

248
00:16:26,020 --> 00:16:28,170
Desmond, look, you--you
gotta tell me.

249
00:16:28,180 --> 00:16:29,330
Where are you?

250
00:16:29,340 --> 00:16:32,420
I-I'm in--I'm in
some kind of sick bay.

251
00:16:32,430 --> 00:16:34,410
No, no, no. Not right now, Desmond.

252
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:37,140
Wherare you supposed to
be? Where are you in 1996?

253
00:16:37,150 --> 00:16:40,800
I-I'm at camp millar.
It's, uh, royal scots regiment.

254
00:16:40,810 --> 00:16:42,740
It's, uh, just north of Glasgow.

255
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:46,450
- Dan, you might wanna-- -
Y-yeah, yeah. No. No, I'm thinking. I'm thinking.

256
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:52,620
Desmond, listen, when it happens
again, Desmond, I need you to get on a train.

257
00:16:52,630 --> 00:16:54,220
Get on a train and go to Oxford.

258
00:16:54,230 --> 00:16:55,650
Oxford university.

259
00:16:55,660 --> 00:16:58,430
Queen's collegephysics
department, all right?

260
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:00,520
W-what? Why?

261
00:17:01,450 --> 00:17:04,580
Because I need you to find me.

262
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:12,410
Where is it? Where is it?

263
00:17:12,420 --> 00:17:13,370
What?

264
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:14,710
My journal, my journal.

265
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:17,050
I need my journal, or I won't believe him.

266
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:19,200
Why does he think he's in 1996?

267
00:17:19,210 --> 00:17:20,320
I don't know. I don't know.

268
00:17:20,330 --> 00:17:22,450
It's unpredictable.
It's a random effect.

269
00:17:22,460 --> 00:17:25,220
Sometimes the displacement's only a
couple of hours. Sometimes it's years.

270
00:17:25,230 --> 00:17:27,710
Wait, wait, this has happened before?

271
00:17:28,090 --> 00:17:30,660
The phone now, please. Thank you.

272
00:17:30,670 --> 00:17:32,460
- Desmond, are you still there?
- Doc?

273
00:17:32,470 --> 00:17:33,940
- Hey, doc, are you okay in there?
- Talk to him.

274
00:17:33,950 --> 00:17:35,660
I can't hold them for long.

275
00:17:35,670 --> 00:17:37,900
Um, yes. Yes, I'm here.

276
00:17:37,910 --> 00:17:40,630
Okay, Desmond, listen, when
you find me at Queen's college,

277
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:44,920
I need you to tell me to
set the device to 2.342

278
00:17:44,930 --> 00:17:45,770
What?

279
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:47,740
All right, you got it? 2.342.

280
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:50,790
And it must be oscillating at 11 hertz.

281
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:52,410
You got it, Desmond?

282
00:17:52,420 --> 00:17:55,380
2.342, oscillating at 11...

283
00:17:55,390 --> 00:17:59,760
Just--ju remember that--2.342
at 11 hertz, all right?

284
00:17:59,770 --> 00:18:01,700
And one more thing, Desmond.

285
00:18:01,710 --> 00:18:07,510
If the numbers don't convince me, I need
you to tell me that you know about Eloise.

286
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:13,400
- Easy, easy.
- Get off the phone.

287
00:18:13,410 --> 00:18:15,860
Tell me that you
knowabout Elo-- ...

288
00:18:41,180 --> 00:18:44,020
Not a single piece of
original thinking...

289
00:18:46,170 --> 00:18:50,380
The concept of "original"--
the opposite of derivative.

290
00:18:50,390 --> 00:18:54,910
I am the one for you to impress, mr.
Hollister, and I'm not impressed.

291
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:57,440
So go. Go try again.

292
00:18:58,850 --> 00:19:03,090
Um, sorry, are--are
you Daniel Faraday?

293
00:19:03,570 --> 00:19:04,550
You are?

294
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:10,190
Uh, I'm sorry. I'm--I'm Desmond
hume, and, uh, I was told I could find you here.

295
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:12,970
And I think I have...

296
00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:15,480
I've just been to the future.

297
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:19,050
- The future?
- Yes.

298
00:19:19,060 --> 00:19:20,330
Uh, I-I spoke to you there.

299
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:23,990
You, uh, you told me to come
here to--to Oxford to find you.

300
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,620
You--you said
you'd help me.

301
00:19:27,630 --> 00:19:31,000
Why didn't I just help
you there in the future?

302
00:19:31,010 --> 00:19:31,810
Sorry?

303
00:19:31,820 --> 00:19:34,380
Why would I put you through the
headache of time traveling?

304
00:19:34,390 --> 00:19:38,980
You--you now what I mean? It just
seems a little... Unnecessary?

305
00:19:39,490 --> 00:19:44,950
And don't you think my esteemed colleagues could've
come up with something just a little more believable?

306
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:47,040
What kind of a prank is that?

307
00:19:47,050 --> 00:19:51,140
Time paradox--so
whole uninspired.

308
00:19:52,470 --> 00:19:55,030
Set your device to, um...

309
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:59,540
2.342 and--and make
sure it oscillates at 11.

310
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:09,540
Okay, now--now
you...

311
00:20:09,550 --> 00:20:12,220
You're gonna tell me who
told you those numbers.

312
00:20:12,230 --> 00:20:15,310
- You did.
- No, this is...

313
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:16,990
This is ridiculous.

314
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,020
I know about Eloise.

315
00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:33,040
What--what
is all this?

316
00:20:33,050 --> 00:20:37,610
This is where I do the
things Oxford frowns upon.

317
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:39,030
All right, this...

318
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:43,610
This future version of me, uh, he--he
referenced this meeting, right?

319
00:20:43,620 --> 00:20:47,700
Obviously. So--so I would
remember you coming to Oxford, right?

320
00:20:47,710 --> 00:20:50,040
I would remember this, here, right now.

321
00:20:50,050 --> 00:20:53,150
- Actually, um, no.
- No?

322
00:20:53,930 --> 00:20:55,960
Maybe you just forgot.

323
00:20:55,970 --> 00:20:58,900
Yeah, right. How would that happen?

324
00:20:59,630 --> 00:21:02,340
This--this
is changing the future?

325
00:21:02,350 --> 00:21:04,190
You can't change the future.

326
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:05,530
What's that for?

327
00:21:05,540 --> 00:21:07,760
Radiation.

328
00:21:09,430 --> 00:21:10,200
Do I get one?

329
00:21:10,210 --> 00:21:12,250
You don't need one.
For prolonged exposure.

330
00:21:12,260 --> 00:21:15,070
I-I do this 20 times a day.

331
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:17,440
So what do you put on your head?

332
00:21:20,430 --> 00:21:22,130
Yeah.

333
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:32,890
This... This is eloise.

334
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:42,760
What does this do?

335
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:43,660
This...

336
00:21:43,660 --> 00:21:47,850
If the numbers you gave me are
correct, what this will do...

337
00:21:48,510 --> 00:21:53,230
is unstick Eloise in time, just like you.

338
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:11,030
- What happened?
- Wait, shh, shh.

339
00:22:11,030 --> 00:22:13,920
She's not back yet.

340
00:22:16,420 --> 00:22:17,770
There she is.

341
00:22:18,270 --> 00:22:22,490
Okay, here goes... Everything.

342
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:26,580
Come on, ce on.

343
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:28,360
That's it.

344
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:31,650
That's it. That's it.

345
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:35,440
That's it.

346
00:22:36,260 --> 00:22:38,110
That's it.

347
00:22:46,030 --> 00:22:48,030
It worked!

348
00:22:48,030 --> 00:22:49,820
Th-this is incredible.

349
00:22:49,820 --> 00:22:52,690
I'm sorry. How is a rat running
through a bloody maze so incredible?

350
00:22:52,690 --> 00:22:58,130
What is incredible is I just
finished the maze this morning,

351
00:22:58,130 --> 00:23:03,350
and I'm not gonna teach her how
to run it until hour from now.

352
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:12,760
S-so--so you--you
sent her to the future.

353
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:15,830
No, no, no, her consciousness, her mind.

354
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:19,980
So--so how does
that help me?

355
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:21,070
You?

356
00:23:21,070 --> 00:23:22,530
Help you? I don't understand.

357
00:23:22,530 --> 00:23:24,920
Am I supposed to help you?
Didn't I send you back here to help me?

358
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:26,790
I don't know why you sent me here.

359
00:23:26,790 --> 00:23:31,150
All I know about you is you--
you end upon some bloody island.

360
00:23:32,250 --> 00:23:33,850
An island?

361
00:23:33,850 --> 00:23:35,560
What island? W-why
would I go to an I--

362
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:37,730
Desmond, give me the phone.

363
00:23:38,610 --> 00:23:40,220
Hey, come on! Everybody relax!

364
00:23:40,220 --> 00:23:44,660
Listen, look, Daniel wanted to talk to the
guy, so we brought him the phone, that's all.

365
00:23:44,660 --> 00:23:46,580
You let Faraday talk to him?

366
00:23:46,580 --> 00:23:47,560
He said he could help.

367
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:49,330
Faraday can't even help himself!

368
00:23:49,330 --> 00:23:52,120
- Outside now.
- The captain wants to talk to you.

369
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:53,850
And I want to talk to your captain.

370
00:23:53,850 --> 00:23:55,660
I'll be sure to let him know.

371
00:23:55,660 --> 00:23:58,150
In the meantime, have a seat.

372
00:24:03,930 --> 00:24:05,110
I need to get back.

373
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:06,720
Back where? The island?

374
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:08,280
He said he could
help. He said --

375
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:10,040
he'd tell me what I needed to do.

376
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:13,970
- Desmond, Desmond, can you
please explain to me-- - Desmond?

377
00:24:14,670 --> 00:24:17,770
You're Desmond?

378
00:24:17,770 --> 00:24:19,890
Do I know you?

379
00:24:19,890 --> 00:24:22,130
I'm George Minkowski.

380
00:24:22,130 --> 00:24:24,970
I'm the communications officer.

381
00:24:24,970 --> 00:24:26,830
Before they strapped me down here,

382
00:24:26,830 --> 00:24:31,900
all the calls to and from this boat
came through me in the radio room.

383
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:39,170
And every so often, I'd get this
flashing light on my console--

384
00:24:39,170 --> 00:24:41,530
an incoming call.

385
00:24:41,530 --> 00:24:44,850
We were under strict
orders never to answer it.

386
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:48,380
So? What's that got to do with me?

387
00:24:48,380 --> 00:24:52,280
Those calls came from your girlfriend.

388
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:55,310
Penelope Widmore.

389
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:06,910
What happened?

390
00:25:06,910 --> 00:25:08,710
Oh, uh, you're back.

391
00:25:08,710 --> 00:25:10,480
And...

392
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:12,930
You were out almost 75 minutes.

393
00:25:12,930 --> 00:25:13,760
Out?

394
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:14,780
Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah.

395
00:25:14,780 --> 00:25:17,360
You just... Whew. You went catatonic
right in the middle of a sentence.

396
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:18,820
I had to carry you to the chair.

397
00:25:18,820 --> 00:25:22,580
So I take it you were-- you
were in the future again?

398
00:25:22,580 --> 00:25:23,490
Aye.

399
00:25:23,490 --> 00:25:25,560
- For how long?
- I don't know.

400
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:27,730
Five minutes?

401
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:31,720
Why does this keep happening?

402
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:36,700
Uh, in your case, I'm guessing
the progression is exponential.

403
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:40,510
Each time your consciousness jumps, it
gets harder and harder to jump back.

404
00:25:40,510 --> 00:25:44,980
I would be careful crossing the
street if I were you.

405
00:25:50,860 --> 00:25:52,540
What happened to her?

406
00:25:52,540 --> 00:25:53,360
She died.

407
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:54,700
Yeah, I can see that. How?

408
00:25:54,700 --> 00:25:56,760
Brain aneurysm, probably. I don't know.

409
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:59,490
I'm going to do an autopsy later.

410
00:25:59,490 --> 00:26:00,930
Is that gonna happen to me?

411
00:26:00,930 --> 00:26:04,620
The effects seem to vary from
case to case, but, uh...

412
00:26:04,620 --> 00:26:05,890
Answer me!

413
00:26:05,890 --> 00:26:09,630
If this keeps happening, am I gonna die?

414
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:13,120
I don't know.

415
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:18,930
I think...

416
00:26:18,930 --> 00:26:22,510
Eloise's brainshort-circuited.

417
00:26:22,510 --> 00:26:24,760
The jumps between the
present and the future--

418
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:27,340
she eventually--she
couldn't tell which was which.

419
00:26:27,340 --> 00:26:28,750
She had no anchor.

420
00:26:28,750 --> 00:26:30,290
Wh-what do you mean, "anchor"?

421
00:26:30,290 --> 00:26:32,970
Something familiar in both times.

422
00:26:32,970 --> 00:26:35,260
All this--see this?
This is all variables.

423
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:36,640
It's random. It's chaotic.

424
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:39,770
Every equation needs
stability, something known.

425
00:26:39,770 --> 00:26:44,540
It's called a constant. Desmond, you
have no constant.

426
00:26:44,540 --> 00:26:47,970
When you go to the
future, nothing there is familiar.

427
00:26:47,970 --> 00:26:50,780
So if you want
to stop this, y--

428
00:26:50,780 --> 00:26:54,040
then you need to find something there,

429
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:58,620
somethin that you
really, really care about...

430
00:26:58,620 --> 00:27:01,500
That also exists back here...

431
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:04,890
In 1996.

432
00:27:06,710 --> 00:27:09,400
This constant...

433
00:27:09,980 --> 00:27:12,240
Can it be a person?

434
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:14,270
Yeah, maybe.

435
00:27:14,270 --> 00:27:17,850
But you have to
make some kind of contact.

436
00:27:17,850 --> 00:27:22,680
Didn't you say you were off on
a boat in the middle of nowhere?

437
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:25,850
Uh...

438
00:27:25,850 --> 00:27:26,970
Who are you calling?

439
00:27:26,970 --> 00:27:30,220
I'm calling my bloody constant.

440
00:27:30,220 --> 00:27:33,670
The number you have dialed
has been disconnected.

441
00:27:38,780 --> 00:27:39,710
Hey, hey.

442
00:27:39,710 --> 00:27:41,570
You okay?

443
00:27:46,910 --> 00:27:50,570
You look a lot older now, huh?

444
00:27:51,190 --> 00:27:53,820
Welcome back, Desmond.

445
00:27:53,820 --> 00:27:55,340
I need to call penny.

446
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:57,230
Calling your girlfriend is
not our priority.

447
00:27:57,230 --> 00:28:00,490
Listen, brother, I don't know
you, but-- but you seem to know me,

448
00:28:00,490 --> 00:28:05,670
so--so if you and me are
friends, then I need your help.

449
00:28:05,670 --> 00:28:08,130
I need to call penny now.

450
00:28:08,130 --> 00:28:10,320
You boys are gettin'way
ahead of yourselves.

451
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:13,440
Two days ago, someone sabotaged
all the equipment.

452
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:16,290
Lost all communication with the mainland.

453
00:28:16,290 --> 00:28:19,610
I probably could've fixed it, but then...

454
00:28:19,610 --> 00:28:20,890
Then I went nuts.

455
00:28:20,890 --> 00:28:23,920
- Where's the radio room?
- It's one deck up.

456
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:25,610
I'll take you there.

457
00:28:25,610 --> 00:28:28,030
Come on.

458
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:31,460
And how do we get out of here?

459
00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:33,930
Through the door.

460
00:28:36,780 --> 00:28:41,760
Looks like you guys
have a-a friend on this boat.

461
00:28:47,350 --> 00:28:49,660
Hey, uh...

462
00:28:50,990 --> 00:28:54,740
Your nose, brother.

463
00:28:58,350 --> 00:29:00,470
It's clear.

464
00:29:01,110 --> 00:29:03,400
Let's go.

465
00:29:17,750 --> 00:29:22,960
"The black rock" set sail from
Portsmouth, England, March 22 1845--

466
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:28,210
on a trading mission to the kingdom of
siam when she was tragically lost at sea.

467
00:29:28,210 --> 00:29:33,440
The only known artifact of this journey
is the journal of the ship's first mate,

468
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:39,210
which was discovered among the artifacts of pirates
on Sante marie, Madagascar, seven years later.

469
00:29:39,210 --> 00:29:41,330
The contents of this journal have
never been made public,

470
00:29:41,330 --> 00:29:46,390
nor are known to anyone outside the
family of the seller, Tovard Hanso.

471
00:29:46,390 --> 00:29:52,240
We open the bidding on lot
2-3-4-2 at 150,000 pounds.

472
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:54,890
150,000, Sir.

473
00:29:54,890 --> 00:29:56,540
160,000? Do I hear 160,000?

474
00:29:56,540 --> 00:29:57,500
160,000, Sir.

475
00:29:57,500 --> 00:29:58,850
170,000, Sir.

476
00:29:58,850 --> 00:30:00,260
180,000 On the phone.

477
00:30:00,260 --> 00:30:02,100
200,000 Pounds.

478
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:03,890
220,000 Pounds.

479
00:30:05,190 --> 00:30:07,340
260,000 Pounds, sir.

480
00:30:08,390 --> 00:30:11,670
On the phone, I have
300,000--320,000.

481
00:30:11,670 --> 00:30:13,560
340,000 Pounds.

482
00:30:16,300 --> 00:30:18,350
- 380,000 Pounds...
- This auction's by appointment only, sir.

483
00:30:18,350 --> 00:30:20,270
Do I hear 400,000 pounds?

484
00:30:20,270 --> 00:30:23,630
- Yeah, listen, pal, I just need to speak to the gentleman over there just for a moment, okay?
- I'm sorry, sir.

485
00:30:23,970 --> 00:30:24,880
Sold...

486
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:30,150
For 380,000 pounds to
bidder 7-5-5. Thank you.

487
00:30:30,150 --> 00:30:31,810
Just for a minute, all right?

488
00:30:31,810 --> 00:30:33,530
- Look-- -
mr. Widmore.

489
00:30:33,530 --> 00:30:34,690
Desmond?

490
00:30:34,690 --> 00:30:35,930
Can I have a word, sir?

491
00:30:35,930 --> 00:30:36,820
I'm
sorry, mr. Widmore. He--

492
00:30:36,820 --> 00:30:38,460
no, no, it's fine.

493
00:30:38,460 --> 00:30:40,900
Possession of Charles
Dickens when he died.

494
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:44,690
- Walk with me.
- We open the bidding on this lot...

495
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:52,560
Your word. Let's have it.

496
00:30:55,710 --> 00:30:58,920
I need to get in touch with Penny.

497
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:03,490
I don't know how to reach her, and
her number has been disconnected.

498
00:31:04,580 --> 00:31:06,790
There was a time when if
you'd have asked her to marry you,

499
00:31:06,790 --> 00:31:09,430
I'm certain she would've said yes.

500
00:31:09,430 --> 00:31:11,390
Fortunately...

501
00:31:11,390 --> 00:31:14,730
Your cowardice won out instead.

502
00:31:19,970 --> 00:31:24,310
I take it you've had second thoughts.

503
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:29,150
And you'd like her to
give you another chance.

504
00:31:29,150 --> 00:31:32,010
Why do you hate me so much?

505
00:31:32,010 --> 00:31:35,250
It's not me who hates you.

506
00:31:36,950 --> 00:31:39,640
Here's her address.

507
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:44,600
I'll let her tell you herself.

508
00:32:00,630 --> 00:32:03,030
Desmond.

509
00:32:04,790 --> 00:32:05,990
I know.

510
00:32:05,990 --> 00:32:07,620
It's getting harder.

511
00:32:07,620 --> 00:32:10,910
It starts happening faster, too.

512
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:13,770
Come on. Let's move.

513
00:32:16,030 --> 00:32:19,350
Hey, how did this happen to you?

514
00:32:19,350 --> 00:32:26,280
We were anchored here, waiting for
our orders, bored out of our minds.

515
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:32,750
Me and Brandon--he's one of the crew
members-- we--we took out the ship's tender.

516
00:32:32,750 --> 00:32:35,630
We just wanted to see the island.

517
00:32:35,630 --> 00:32:41,030
But Brandon started acting
crazy, so we had to turn around.

518
00:32:41,030 --> 00:32:41,940
Where is he?

519
00:32:41,940 --> 00:32:45,300
In a body bag.

520
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:51,340
There.

521
00:32:53,030 --> 00:32:54,600
Who did this?

522
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:56,230
You got me.

523
00:32:56,230 --> 00:33:00,170
But when the captain
finds out, I feel sor--

524
00:33:03,580 --> 00:33:08,590
after your call, someone has to
tell me precisely what is going on.

525
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:11,630
Can you fix it, brother?

526
00:33:11,630 --> 00:33:14,680
I need a minute.

527
00:33:15,530 --> 00:33:18,780
Do you have the number to make the call?

528
00:33:18,780 --> 00:33:20,900
George? Wake up, brother. Wake up.

529
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:22,510
You've gotta come
back. You've gotta come back.

530
00:33:22,510 --> 00:33:25,930
Desmond, do you know the number?

531
00:33:28,980 --> 00:33:33,270
- No.
- Well, you'd better remember it.

532
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:41,280
It's 2004.

533
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:43,530
I didn't realize it was almost christmas.

534
00:33:43,530 --> 00:33:46,160
It's been...

535
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:49,010
Desmond.

536
00:33:51,270 --> 00:33:53,560
No!

537
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:58,330
I can't...

538
00:33:58,330 --> 00:34:00,310
Get...

539
00:34:00,310 --> 00:34:03,740
Back.

540
00:34:13,290 --> 00:34:16,720
What happened to him?

541
00:34:17,750 --> 00:34:22,180
The same thing that's gonna happen to me.

542
00:35:18,020 --> 00:35:20,690
Desmond?

543
00:35:21,100 --> 00:35:22,470
What are you doing here?

544
00:35:22,470 --> 00:35:26,490
I had to--I mean, I tried to call
you, but you--you disconnected your phone.

545
00:35:26,490 --> 00:35:28,550
Yeah, because I moved.

546
00:35:29,420 --> 00:35:31,220
Look, I don't know if
you're getting the signals, Desmond,

547
00:35:31,220 --> 00:35:34,370
but I'm trying to make a clean break
from you, so if you don't mind, I'm gonna--

548
00:35:34,370 --> 00:35:35,490
wait, wait, wait, wait. Pen, please wait.

549
00:35:35,490 --> 00:35:37,310
I just--I just need to get
your new phone number, okay?

550
00:35:37,310 --> 00:35:38,300
Why would I give you that?

551
00:35:38,300 --> 00:35:40,100
Because I-I made a huge mistake.

552
00:35:40,100 --> 00:35:41,620
I-I should never have broken
up with you, and--and--and...

553
00:35:41,620 --> 00:35:44,160
I know--I know that
now, and--and I'm sorry and--

554
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:46,460
- Oh, don't. Just don't--
- I understand, and--

555
00:35:46,460 --> 00:35:49,380
and I-I know it's--it's
too late to change things,

556
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:54,380
but I need to tell you something, and--and
I need you to listen to me, and...

557
00:35:54,380 --> 00:35:57,710
Look, I-I know it's
gonna sound ridiculous, but...

558
00:35:57,710 --> 00:36:00,170
Please, Pen.

559
00:36:00,170 --> 00:36:04,480
I need you to listen to me.

560
00:36:11,190 --> 00:36:15,460
Just say what you
need to say and then go.

561
00:36:15,460 --> 00:36:16,840
I know this doesn't make any sense,

562
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:23,210
because it doesn't make any sense
to me, but eight years from now, I...

563
00:36:23,210 --> 00:36:29,290
I-I need to call you, and I can't
call you if I don't have your number.

564
00:36:29,290 --> 00:36:30,070
What?

565
00:36:30,070 --> 00:36:32,140
Look, penny, just--just
give me your number.

566
00:36:32,140 --> 00:36:33,880
I-I know--I know
I have ruined things.

567
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:35,890
I know you think things are
over between us, but they're not.

568
00:36:35,890 --> 00:36:40,140
If there's any part of you
that still believes in us, just...

569
00:36:40,140 --> 00:36:41,520
Just give me your number.

570
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:43,250
And what's to say you wouldn't call
me tonight or tomorrow--

571
00:36:43,250 --> 00:36:45,490
I won't call...

572
00:36:45,490 --> 00:36:49,800
For eight years.

573
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:53,300
December the 24th, 2004.

574
00:36:53,300 --> 00:36:57,010
Christmas eve.

575
00:36:57,010 --> 00:37:00,090
I promise.

576
00:37:01,510 --> 00:37:05,390
Please, Pen.

577
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:09,420
If I give you the number, will you leave?

578
00:37:09,420 --> 00:37:12,820
Aye.

579
00:37:17,580 --> 00:37:22,110
7946-0893.

580
00:37:23,110 --> 00:37:25,360
7946-0893. 7946...

581
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:29,690
All that, and you're
not gonna write it down?

582
00:37:30,620 --> 00:37:33,910
It wouldn't do any good.

583
00:37:33,910 --> 00:37:35,240
You have to keep that number.

584
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:37,190
- You can't change your number for eight years.
- Get out!

585
00:37:37,190 --> 00:37:39,860
Just--just remember, december
the 24th, 2004.

586
00:37:39,860 --> 00:37:42,540
Look, Pen, if--if you still care
about me, you have to answer.

587
00:37:42,540 --> 00:37:43,460
I'm not crazy, Penny!

588
00:37:43,460 --> 00:37:45,040
You have to believe me!

589
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:47,780
You have--you
have to trust me.

590
00:37:47,780 --> 00:37:54,710
I do trust you, but you still
have to remember that number.

591
00:37:54,710 --> 00:38:00,340
7946-0893.

592
00:38:00,340 --> 00:38:01,450
It's a London number.

593
00:38:01,450 --> 00:38:04,070
Excellent timing.

594
00:38:04,070 --> 00:38:10,390
The patch is done, but I don't
know how long the battery will last.

595
00:38:11,900 --> 00:38:14,140
I hope she's there.

596
00:38:14,140 --> 00:38:16,700
I hope so, too.

597
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:54,740
Hello?

598
00:38:56,350 --> 00:38:58,550
Penny?

599
00:38:58,550 --> 00:39:01,570
Desmond?

600
00:39:11,860 --> 00:39:15,490
Penny. Penny, you answered.

601
00:39:15,490 --> 00:39:18,480
You answered, Penny.

602
00:39:20,420 --> 00:39:22,930
Des, where are you?

603
00:39:22,930 --> 00:39:25,060
I'm...

604
00:39:26,420 --> 00:39:27,760
I'm...

605
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:29,070
I'm--I'm
on a boat.

606
00:39:29,070 --> 00:39:36,120
I've-- I have been on
an island, Pen.

607
00:39:36,580 --> 00:39:38,210
My god, penny, is that really you?

608
00:39:38,210 --> 00:39:40,050
Yeah!

609
00:39:40,050 --> 00:39:43,530
Yes, it's me!

610
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:47,630
You believed me.

611
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:49,840
You still care about me.

612
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:50,790
Des...

613
00:39:50,790 --> 00:39:54,130
I've been looking for
you for the past three years.

614
00:39:54,130 --> 00:39:56,080
I know about the island.

615
00:39:56,080 --> 00:40:01,810
I've been research-- and then when
I spoke to your friend Charlie...

616
00:40:01,810 --> 00:40:04,490
That's when I knew you were still alive.

617
00:40:04,490 --> 00:40:09,420
That's when I knew I wasn't crazy.

618
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:11,080
Des, are you still there?

619
00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:12,500
Yes! Yes, I'm here!

620
00:40:12,500 --> 00:40:13,760
I'm still here. Can you hear me?

621
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:16,700
Yeah, yeah, that's better.

622
00:40:16,700 --> 00:40:19,750
I love you, penny.

623
00:40:21,470 --> 00:40:25,030
I've always loved you.

624
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:29,150
I'm so sorry.

625
00:40:29,150 --> 00:40:31,400
I love you.

626
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:33,440
I love you, too.

627
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:34,510
I don't know where I am, but...

628
00:40:34,510 --> 00:40:35,450
I'll find you, Des...

629
00:40:35,450 --> 00:40:36,870
- I promise...
- No matter what...

630
00:40:36,870 --> 00:40:38,200
- I'll come back to you.
- I won't give up.

631
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:39,490
- I promise.
- I promise.

632
00:40:39,490 --> 00:40:42,670
I love you.

633
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:53,440
I'm sorry.

634
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:56,530
The power source went dead.
That's all we have.

635
00:41:06,090 --> 00:41:09,770
Thank you, Sayid.

636
00:41:12,890 --> 00:41:15,930
It was enough.

637
00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:21,490
Are you all right now?

638
00:41:22,100 --> 00:41:24,360
Aye.

639
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:27,800
I'm perfect.
