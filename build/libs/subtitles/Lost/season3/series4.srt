2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:05,678
- What do you want from me?
- Patience, Jack.

3
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:07,549
Patience.

4
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:10,108
- Danny, wait!
- Hold up.

5
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:12,872
Be careful out there.

6
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:16,074
See these rocks?
You're gonna chop 'em loose.

7
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:17,593
You haul 'em outta here.

8
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:26,109
I am not the enemy.
We are not the enemy.

9
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:29,989
But if you shoot me,
that's exactly what we'll become.

10
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:11,437
You've got a problem with your roof.

11
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:14,628
What?

12
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:17,553
Maybe you should move down the beach,
just for tonight.

13
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:20,393
That way I can fix it,
make some improvements.

14
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:23,790
That's really nice of you to offer,
but, Aaron just fell asleep.

15
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:27,475
- So I should probably just...
- No, it'll be worth it. I promise.

16
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:29,958
Whatcha doing, brother?

17
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:32,516
I was just offering
to fix this roof here.

18
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:35,278
Roof?

19
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:38,796
Fine. There's a problem, I'll fix it.
I'm quite handy.

20
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:42,598
I was building a church before...
Eko exploded.

21
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:47,119
Right.

22
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,428
Well.

23
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,513
Just trying to help.

24
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:53,912
Thanks.

25
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,638
What was all that about?

26
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:59,916
I don't know.

27
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,719
We're gonna have to get
that guy another button to push.

28
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:34,799
- How are you doing today, Jack?
- Great.

29
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:38,234
You seem frustrated.

30
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:42,915
Am I gonna keep watching cartoons,
or are you gonna tell me why I'm here?

31
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:45,996
I hope you like blueberry.

32
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,911
- Should I talk to Benjamin?
- Sorry?

33
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,433
Should I talk to Benjamin?

34
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:53,274
Because I'm starting to think you're
just the person who brings me my food.

35
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:58,959
You can talk to him all you want...
but he won't tell you anything.

36
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:01,235
- You work for him?
- No, I don't work for him.

37
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:04,232
- He's in charge.
- It doesn't work that way over here.

38
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:06,629
- We make decisions together.
- Really?

39
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:10,512
Because... when I was holding
that broken plate at your neck,

40
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:14,036
he seemed happy to just let you die.

41
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:16,998
It felt like he made that decision
on his own.

42
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:22,029
You don't know
what you're talking about.

43
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:23,917
I don't answer to him.

44
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:25,509
Juliet, I need you.

45
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:27,874
Can it wait?

46
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:32,439
The sub is back.
We have a situation.

47
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:33,999
So come with me now.

48
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:58,068
Time for work.

49
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:03,552
Sounding a little stuffy there,
Chinatown.

50
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:07,115
- Need to blow your nose?
- Give me an excuse.

51
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,794
I thought I did.
What, I gotta talk about your mother?

52
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:13,558
<i>- Danny, are you there?
- Yeah?</i>

53
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:15,514
Hold on.

54
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,479
OK, go.

55
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:19,879
<i>Yeah, listen, Danny.</i>

56
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:21,994
What?

57
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:24,994
<i>- Where are they?
- They're back in...</i>

58
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:30,958
She's hurt bad, Juliet.

59
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,439
Keep her steady.

60
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:40,990
She's gonna be fine, right?
She'll be, OK?

61
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:45,719
What happened?

62
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:50,589
- We happened.
- What?

63
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:55,075
Been on this rock long enough to realize
they ain't shooting each other.

64
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,510
We did it.

65
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:02,797
- Our team.
- You smiling?

66
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:06,355
Damn right I'm smiling.

67
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:10,190
'Cause we just got
our ticket outta here.

68
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:35,595
What are you doing?

69
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:42,758
- Whenever you're ready to fill me in.
- I'm thinking.

70
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:45,029
<i>Warning!</i>

71
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:49,436
<i>Reward! Reward!</i>

72
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:02,268
That chick they brought in
on the stretcher,

73
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:04,191
that's Broken Nose Man's girl.

74
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:05,679
They call him "Pickett. "

75
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,673
Well, Pickett is distracted
at the moment.

76
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,753
So?

77
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:15,631
Watch and learn, little lady.

78
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,353
<i>Warning!</i>

79
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:19,354
<i>Warning!</i>

80
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:22,637
There's juice pumping into this box
from somewhere.

81
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:25,712
Next time someone comes
to pull me out,

82
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:28,394
I wait till they
step in my little swimming hole,

83
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:30,436
then I grab 'em.

84
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:34,672
They fall back from the shock,
I snag the keys.

85
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:36,716
Bet the bears never thought of that.

86
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,515
- You're both gonna get electrocuted.
- I felt the jolt. I can take it.

87
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,719
The other guy,
he ain't gonna be ready for it.

88
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:49,037
- What? You think I'm crazy?
- No, I'm actually impressed.

89
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:54,833
Well, wipe the stars outta your eyes,
sweetheart, 'cause we're gonna do this.

90
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:00,400
- So what about Jack?
- What about him?

91
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:05,350
We don't even know if he's here.
We don't even know if he's alive.

92
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,991
We gotta take care of us.

93
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:13,349
It's every man for himself, Freckles.

94
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,756
All right, Ford. That's enough.

95
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:27,989
<i>All tier two inmates are
required to report to your cells.</i>

96
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,274
<i>Mandatory down time.</i>

97
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:32,397
Problem is I was following your hands,
not your eyes.

98
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:34,277
Problem is you old and dumb.

99
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:37,079
- Where did you hide it?
- I don't know!

100
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,599
Who's the punching bag?

101
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:44,720
- Tell me something!
- Just got here, name's Munson.

102
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:47,837
Rumour has it he ripped off
the government for ten mil.

103
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:49,956
But they never found the money.

104
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:51,553
Well, I'll be damned.

105
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:55,435
If your buddy the warden didn't keep
breaking up the fights, he'd be dead.

106
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:57,670
Get off of him! Hey!

107
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:59,318
I didn't do anything!

108
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:03,316
That son of a bitch.

109
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:13,076
Get little mints
on your pillow at night, too?

110
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,957
- Sorry?
- You been here a week

111
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:19,511
and you're on tote bag duty? Been here
nine months, I'm still pushing trash.

112
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:21,638
Well, what does that mean?

113
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:26,874
You think the warden's breaking up those
fights cause you're cute, Costanza?

114
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:30,718
He's making a play for that ten mil.

115
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:35,355
First step, butter you up.
Give you a plum job.

116
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:41,155
Step Two, warden'll reach out
to your wife, use her against you.

117
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:43,313
Textbook con.

118
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:47,472
And you're telling me this
out of the kindness of your...

119
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:49,312
Advice is free, Murgatroyd.

120
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:53,789
Past nine months that warden's
made my life a living hell.

121
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:55,996
He gets that ten mil you ain't got,

122
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,991
I just might have to kill myself.

123
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:00,713
Hey.

124
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:09,072
Well, howdy, Warden.

125
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:11,951
He bothering you, Munson?

126
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:15,715
So what brings you
to the sewing shop, boss?

127
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:22,598
Don't think I can't
extend your stay, Ford.

128
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:25,516
All it takes is one call.

129
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:28,159
One call.

130
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:38,151
Now, how about you get that trash.

131
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,989
Oh, yeah. The Big Kahuna.

132
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:10,475
- Lunch already?
- What do you weigh?

133
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:12,755
- What?
- What do you weigh?

134
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:17,630
One-eighty, give or take.

135
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:22,638
- How old are you?
- Thirty-two.

136
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:23,709
Don't lie.

137
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:28,039
Thirty-five.

138
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:32,113
Good.

139
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:38,952
Sayonara, sucker!

140
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:50,272
- What did you do?
- We turned it off.

141
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:52,759
Sawyer!

142
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,433
Hey!

143
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,592
Where do I start?

144
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:19,275
In the two days since the sky
turned purple, we've been blind.

145
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:21,999
Our coms are all down,
and I can't get 'em back up again.

146
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:24,036
And, Colleen's in critical...

147
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:25,678
Juliet's taking care of her.

148
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:29,676
Where am I?

149
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:37,357
What the hell are you doing to me?

150
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:38,789
Let me out!

151
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,315
Jason?

152
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:41,833
Let me out!

153
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:44,788
- Bite down on this, please.
- You bite down on it.

154
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:47,788
It's for the pain.

155
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:57,239
God, I hate needles.

156
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,910
No! No! What are you doing?

157
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:04,874
<i>Wait! What are you doing? No!</i>

158
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:10,117
What are you doing?
Let me outta here!

159
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:13,351
No, you have to go
through the sternum.

160
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:14,793
- Like in the movie.
- I know.

161
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:18,878
- No!
- One...

162
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:20,996
- What are you doing?
- Two...

163
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:22,829
Wait!

164
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:36,673
Don't mind me.
I'm gonna take one of your clubs.

165
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:39,354
Hurley said it'd be all right.

166
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,192
Hurley?

167
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:43,077
Must mean you're off to save the day.

168
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,791
So, I can take one of these?

169
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:50,311
Take the five iron. I never use it.

170
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:53,039
That way when you die in the jungle
doing whatever,

171
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:55,031
I don't have to go looking for it.

172
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:57,399
Thanks, mate.

173
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:05,913
You might wanna square
your shoulders a bit more.

174
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:10,869
- You play golf?
- I'm Scottish. Cheers.

175
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:38,958
What the hell's...

176
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:44,269
Hey!

177
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,228
Hey, come on!

178
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:52,237
Hey, move! Let's move!

179
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:55,118
- Hey, come on, come on, come on!
- What are you doing?

180
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:14,316
Did you just kill that bunny?

181
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:21,948
- You know what a pacemaker is?
- What?

182
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:25,633
They stick 'em in tickers
of people who have bypass work,

183
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:28,757
whose hearts need just a little jump,
a... kick start.

184
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:34,633
The rabbit had a pacemaker to deliver
a kick start should it get too excited.

185
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:38,030
Or anxious or frightened.

186
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:40,792
Or should it try to escape.

187
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:49,516
Assuming that you were telling the truth
about your age and weight,

188
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:53,479
your resting heart rate
should be about 70 beats per minute.

189
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:55,757
Your active heart rate, however...

190
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:59,396
that would be about 140.

191
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:03,358
Which is the point
at which your pacemaker...

192
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:08,030
...will cause your heart to explode.

193
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:16,913
Which is how I know
that you're gonna start behaving now.

194
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:25,478
The watch monitors your pulse.

195
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:30,993
If you get within 15 beats of
your danger zone, it'll start to beep.

196
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:33,275
If and when it beeps,

197
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:35,351
you're gonna wanna relax yourself.

198
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:39,877
Do some deep breathing, some yoga.

199
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:46,436
If you want me dead, why don't you
just shoot me and get it over with?

200
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:50,119
Because we're not killers, James.

201
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:56,115
And one other thing.

202
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:58,111
- Kate.
- You touch her, I swear...

203
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:00,953
Tell her what we put in you,
that we're watching you...

204
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:03,349
...you tell her any of these things...

205
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:05,635
...we'll put one in her, too.

206
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:21,990
Sawyer?

207
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:23,795
Are you OK?

208
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:36,669
That's so you can clean yourselves up.

209
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:39,513
If any of that doesn't fit,
you just give me a holler, OK?

210
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:51,312
What happened?

211
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:53,834
What did they do to you?

212
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:56,878
Nothing. They just asked me questions.

213
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:03,072
- It ain't important.
- Talk to me. What happened?

214
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:05,435
Look, I told you. Nothing happened.

215
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:07,279
So quit asking me.

216
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:21,912
Turn around.

217
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:58,599
- What's that?
- It's just my watch. It's busted.

218
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:01,792
- When did you get a watch?
- Look, I don't tell you everything!

219
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,831
Just leave me alone, damn it!

220
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,916
Put some clothes on!

221
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:28,238
<i>A reminder that the services
will be held in the chapel at 9:30.</i>

222
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:43,758
Hello, Sawyer.

223
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:50,158
It's James Ford.

224
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:53,471
I know you know, cause you
got it right when you pressed charges.

225
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:57,511
- You're mad at me?
- Well, look where I am.

226
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,991
What did you want me to do?
You conned me.

227
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:01,638
Something you want?

228
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:05,556
Yeah. Yeah... there is.

229
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:09,316
Come on. I got license plates to make.

230
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:29,319
What's this?

231
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:32,031
This is your daughter.

232
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,228
What do you want?

233
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:39,999
- First I wanted you to know.
- Then what?

234
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:43,152
I take one look at this picture
and turn into Father Knows Best?

235
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:45,990
We're living in Albuquerque.

236
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:48,036
- Near the university.
- Why are you telling me?

237
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:50,918
I just thought you could
write her a letter.

238
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:55,316
- Her name's Clementine.
- What the hell am I gonna write?

239
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:57,994
She's a baby. She ain't mine!

240
00:19:58,440 --> 00:19:59,919
Sawyer, she is...

241
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:02,551
I ain't got no daughter!

242
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:23,677
I've been checking out my cage,
and I think...

243
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:27,199
...if I climb to the top
I can squeeze through the bars.

244
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:29,919
They're spaced farther apart up there.

245
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,991
Don't bother.

246
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:35,152
- What are you talking about?
- I'm talking about being smart.

247
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:38,632
Think we should chill out awhile,
get the lay of the land.

248
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:45,353
<i>Everything's under control.</i>

249
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:48,113
<i>Yeah? You know what he's doing to Karl?</i>

250
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:49,952
<i>He knows what he's doing.</i>

251
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:52,474
<i>It was a mistake
bringing those two here.</i>

252
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:57,278
- What did you do to Sawyer?
- Nothing.

253
00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:00,238
I heard him yelling.
You've got blood on your clothes.

254
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:01,833
It's not his blood!

255
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:06,232
Then whose blood is it?

256
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:08,629
It's the blood of a woman who's dying.

257
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:15,512
Jack, I need your help.

258
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:30,274
It's Jack!

259
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:34,955
- Jack!
- Doc!

260
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:49,870
Have you lost your mind?

261
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:52,190
- Bring him here?
- He's a doctor. He can help.

262
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:54,589
- This is not why...
- Do you want her to die?

263
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:55,999
Come on.

264
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:03,714
- What happened?
- Gunshot wound. To the abdomen.

265
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:13,910
Those aren't hers. Come on.

266
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:20,470
- What's he doing here?
- He's here to help.

267
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:23,074
- Tell him who did it. He oughta know!
- I need him out.

268
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:24,513
Get out. Go.

269
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:26,716
- Danny, they got it.
- No way! She's my wife!

270
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:31,357
I got the bullet out,
but she's still bleeding.

271
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:35,395
Right upper quadrant.
It's flowing badly.

272
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:36,595
No, I padded it.

273
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:39,069
Clamp under the liver
so I can look back there.

274
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:44,198
I'm not a surgeon.

275
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:47,793
I know. But I need you to do this.

276
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:52,155
Here.

277
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:56,710
Retrohepatic caval bleeding, behind
the liver, that's why you missed it.

278
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:59,475
I need lap pads,
as many as you've got.

279
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:14,436
A crash cart. Now!
Juliet, I need paddles.

280
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:15,953
It's broken.

281
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:21,032
We haven't had...
we haven't had anything happen before.

282
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:04,033
Time of death at...

283
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:08,753
She's gone.

284
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:16,232
They did this! They did this!

285
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:19,710
Danny, wait. Danny, wait, wait. No.

286
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:39,993
Take it easy, hoss!
Take it easy!

287
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:43,915
Shut up!

288
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:48,356
You love this guy?

289
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:49,953
What?

290
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:52,395
- I said do you love him?
- Stop!

291
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:55,752
Do you love him?

292
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:58,711
- Do you love him?
- Leave him alone!

293
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:02,914
- Do you love him?
- What are you doing? Stop!

294
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,150
Do... you...

295
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:08,994
...love... him?
- Yes, I love him!

296
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:12,868
I love him! Please!

297
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:27,717
Lock him up!

298
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:41,349
- I need to talk to you.
- Sorry, I'm busy.

299
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:42,759
It's important.

300
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:45,674
Please.

301
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:50,592
You were right. I loved her.

302
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:52,671
And I really thought she...

303
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:55,115
Ten mil's a lotta greenbacks, killer.

304
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,758
Tends to change things.

305
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,514
That's why you never get attached.

306
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:03,990
'Cause once you care,
that's when they can come at you.

307
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:07,755
Well, what did yours want?

308
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:11,550
I saw you the other day with a woman.
What did she want?

309
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:15,270
Something I ain't got.

310
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:18,469
That all?
You had yourself a good cry?

311
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:20,869
Mind if I go back
and see if George gets his farm?

312
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:25,954
I need you to move it.
The money.

313
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:28,073
The money you didn't steal?

314
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:31,237
We both know I did.

315
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:33,629
Lila's hired a P.I.
She's gonna find it.

316
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:35,597
Do this for me. You have to.

317
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:41,468
No. It's too dangerous.
I'll be a walking target.

318
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:45,509
If you don't help me,
the warden'll get it all. He'll win.

319
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:48,509
Please. Please.

320
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:58,668
Are you OK?

321
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:01,677
Dandy.

322
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:04,911
Guy hits like a girl.
No offence.

323
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:08,477
Why did he do that?

324
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:10,312
Hell if I know.

325
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:12,716
These people ever make
any sense to you?

326
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:16,639
What are you doing?

327
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:19,429
- What are you doing?
- What does it look like?

328
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:25,958
Hang on a second, Freckles.

329
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:33,831
I told you, the time ain't right.

330
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:36,995
You're the one who said we had to go.

331
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:39,275
- Well, that was before...
- Before what?

332
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:44,635
I don't know what they did to you, but
you're scared enough to lie about it.

333
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:48,315
And that scares me more than anything
they may have done to us before.

334
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:50,550
Wait!

335
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:53,116
Wait!

336
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:03,872
- What are you doing?
- Getting you out.

337
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:06,349
- Don't!
- I'm not leaving you, Sawyer.

338
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:09,000
- I can get it open.
- You're already out. You gotta go.

339
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:11,596
- You gotta leave me!
- What?

340
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:12,829
Run!

341
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:15,955
- What did they do to you?
- Will you go!

342
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:21,076
- What is that thing?
- You run.

343
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:24,835
- Just go. It's every man for himself.
- Why didn't you fight back?

344
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:29,397
Tell me the truth,
for once in your life!

345
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:32,836
If you really love me...

346
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:35,358
...go.

347
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:41,430
I only said that
so he'd stop hitting you.

348
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:52,800
Run. Hurry!

349
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:57,035
What the hell are you doing?

350
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:00,356
Kate!

351
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:03,439
Damn it, Freckles, don't.
Every man for himself!

352
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:25,195
Live together, die alone.

353
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:45,509
You know Danny wants to kill him.

354
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:51,393
Danny can wait.

355
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:53,835
Should I bring Shephard back?

356
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:01,917
No.

357
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:06,237
I want him to sit with her
for a while longer.

358
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:24,512
I'm sorry they
had to put handcuffs on you.

359
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:33,710
I'm a fertility doctor.

360
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:40,958
I'm not used to death.

361
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:46,399
- What was her name?
- Cole.

362
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:48,752
Short for Colleen.

363
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:53,831
I shouldn't have...
I should've come to get you sooner.

364
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:55,751
It wouldn't have mattered.

365
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:59,037
There wasn't any more
that you could've done.

366
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:01,509
She was dead
before you put her on the table.

367
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:07,430
Are you saying that
to make me feel better?

368
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:19,034
I don't care about
making you feel better.

369
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:27,430
I'm gonna take you back now.

370
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:31,914
I'm sorry for bringing you here.

371
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,798
Whose x-rays are those? Outside?

372
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:42,112
Those are spinal x-rays, and they belong
to a man about 40 years old.

373
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:46,193
And whoever he is, he has a very large
tumour on his L-four vertebrae.

374
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:50,431
And I just happen to be
a spinal surgeon.

375
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:53,193
So, you tell me, Juliet.

376
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:56,352
Who am I here to save?

377
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:35,999
Is that...

378
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:39,079
...art?

379
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:42,228
No. Just an experiment.

380
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,433
OK.

381
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:50,598
- You want some fruit salad?
- Thanks. I'm not hungry.

382
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:54,796
You might want to wait a minute.

383
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:56,799
Why's that?

384
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:43,919
Good morning.

385
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:47,752
Let's go for a walk.

386
00:34:15,240 --> 00:34:16,992
I have to be honest, Ford.

387
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:22,559
They first brought you here, I thought
you were nothing more than a dumb hick.

388
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:24,119
Now I know better.

389
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:27,794
You're a dumb hick
that knows how to steal.

390
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:31,556
Can we just get this over with?

391
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:35,152
Yeah, let's.

392
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:39,471
You remember Agent Freedman
from the Treasury Department?

393
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:43,753
So, what do you got?

394
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:54,912
<i>The ten million's in a red Bronco in
a Store-It-Quick facility in Sawgrass.</i>

395
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:56,792
Right off 441.

396
00:34:58,200 --> 00:35:00,350
Unit 23-C.

397
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:05,993
That's where your money is.

398
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:08,150
As agreed,

399
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:11,835
the last six years of your sentence
have been commuted.

400
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:15,478
Soon as the truck is recovered,
and the funds confirmed,

401
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:17,630
your commission will be processed.

402
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:20,071
Now, how would you like that?

403
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:23,109
Set up a new account.
Don't matter what bank.

404
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:24,952
Just make it in Albuquerque.

405
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:26,473
OK.

406
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:31,513
Put it in the name
of Clementine Phillips.

407
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:34,589
OK. Clementine Phillips.

408
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:40,353
And I want it so there's no way she
can ever find out who the money's from.

409
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:43,398
Who's Clementine Phillips?

410
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:46,633
We done?

411
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:50,994
Congratulations, Ford.

412
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:53,719
You just lied and cheated
your way outta prison.

413
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:57,432
You're a free man.

414
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:18,278
Not much further, James.

415
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:20,396
Just to the top of the next rise.

416
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:26,358
What's up there?

417
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:28,192
Something I want you to see.

418
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:33,478
"Is it that little place
you always wanted, George?"

419
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:34,788
Sorry?

420
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:37,678
What, don't you read?

421
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:40,237
<i>It's from Of Mice and Men.</i>

422
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:44,318
You'd like it. Puppies get killed.

423
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:12,759
Bring me up here to kill me?

424
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:15,559
Make that thing you put inside me...

425
00:37:15,640 --> 00:37:17,631
...blow up my damn heart?

426
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:22,870
Your heart's not gonna blow up, James.

427
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:27,434
The only thing
we put inside you was doubt.

428
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:33,310
The watch is
a heart rate monitor, but...

429
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:35,239
...nothing more.

430
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:38,713
Look.

431
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:46,473
We gave him a sedative,
not a pacemaker.

432
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:50,191
How do I know that's the same bunny?

433
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:53,113
That you didn't just
paint an eight on another one?

434
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:55,468
You don't.

435
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:06,273
You son of a bitch.

436
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,673
The rabbit wasn't the thing
I wanted to show you.

437
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:29,752
What the?

438
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:43,753
You ever been to Alcatraz?

439
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:45,798
Take the tour?

440
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:50,749
You're standing on a small island
roughly twice the size of Alcatraz.

441
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:56,632
And that over there?

442
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:58,278
That's your island.

443
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:01,150
The one you've come to know and love.

444
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:06,117
I just wanted you to know...

445
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:08,232
...there's nowhere to run.

446
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:13,596
You did all this just to...

447
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:17,836
...just to keep me in a damn cage?

448
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:21,754
We did all this because the only way to
gain a con man's respect is to con him.

449
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:26,031
You're pretty good, Sawyer.

450
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:30,438
We're a lot better.

451
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:38,552
Funny thing is, the pacemaker
wasn't what kept you in line.

452
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:40,198
It was when I threatened her.

453
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:45,152
You work so hard to make her think
you don't care,

454
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:47,879
that you don't need her, but...

455
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:53,072
"A guy goes nuts if he ain't got nobody.

456
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:57,518
It don't make no difference
who the guy is...

457
00:39:57,600 --> 00:39:59,795
...long as he's with you.

458
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:02,950
I tell you...

459
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:06,112
I tell you a guy gets too
lonely and he gets sick. "

460
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:10,398
<i>- What are you talking about?
- It's from Of Mice and Men.</i>

461
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:12,992
Don't you read?

462
00:40:21,080 --> 00:40:22,479
Come on.

463
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:26,431
Let's get you back to your cage.
