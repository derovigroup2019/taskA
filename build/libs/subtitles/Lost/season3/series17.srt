00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,319
<i>Previously on Lost:</i>

2
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:04,152
- Let me ask you something.
- Anything.

3
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:05,992
How'd you know Claire was drowning?

4
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:19,995
Claire!

5
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:23,874
I could hear her calling for help.

6
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:27,232
You hear the lightning as well?

7
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:45,279
I wasn't saving Claire, Charlie.
I was saving you.

8
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:51,234
When I saw the lightning hit the roof,
you were electrocuted.

9
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:54,949
And when you heard Claire
was in the water, you...

10
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:57,838
You drowned trying to save her.

11
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:01,310
I've tried, brother,
I've tried twice to save you, but...

12
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:02,879
No matter what I try to do...

13
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:07,709
...you're gonna die, Charlie.

14
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:21,754
You're insane, mate.

15
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:26,472
Superman can fly around the
entire planet in the blink of an eye.

16
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:29,358
Dude, if we're going by
a pure foot race,

17
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:31,237
Supes would get dusted by the Flash.

18
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:35,199
Why would the Man of Steel
agree to a sodding foot race?

19
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:37,436
For charity.

20
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:41,593
And Flash would totally win, because
he can vibrate through walls and stuff.

21
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:46,037
Vibration! Whatever would Superman do
if he came up against a wall?

22
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:47,951
Well, no smashing allowed.

23
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:52,075
No flying, no smashing... Any other
restrictions I need to know about?

24
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:55,038
Perhaps we should fit Superman
with a pair of kryptonite...

25
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:58,349
What the hell?

26
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:04,675
Charlie!

27
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:08,317
- Don't touch it!
- Oh, my God. Oh, my God!

28
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:09,435
Just breathe...

29
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:12,436
Don't try to talk.
We've got to get him back.

30
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:14,192
- No! You help!
- I can't help!

31
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:17,679
I'm sorry, mate.

32
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,195
<i>Superman can fly
around the entire planet.</i>

33
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:16,552
Hey! Where's the wire?

34
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:20,029
You eat those mushrooms
Jack warned us about?

35
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:23,874
Listen to me. There's a wire,
a cable, buried in the sand.

36
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:27,112
Do you know what I'm talking about?

37
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:31,196
- This is future crap, isn't it?
- The cable! Do you know where it is?

38
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:35,228
- This is important.
- Why?

39
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:38,959
<i>Superman.</i>

40
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:46,152
Because someone's coming.

41
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:40,068
God tests our faith in many ways.

42
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:43,835
As you well know,
we have our own test here.

43
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:48,038
A vow of silence that lasts
as long as we see fit.

44
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:53,877
This challenges both
one's patience and his faith.

45
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:57,152
For some it may last a week,

46
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:00,277
those we're less sure about, a month.

47
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:03,390
Personally, Desmond,

48
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:05,675
I never thought you'd last.

49
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,956
And so now I stand corrected.

50
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:15,592
For whatever reason,
your path has led you here.

51
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:19,273
And now you're one of us.

52
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:24,673
Welcome, brother.

53
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:30,037
Thank you... brother.

54
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:37,475
Morning, Jack.

55
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,797
Must be nice to wake up
in your own bed.

56
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:47,073
Yeah. Home sweet home.

57
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:51,472
Listen, I was wondering if I could
borrow your first aid kit.

58
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:55,913
I've twisted my ankle.

59
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:02,593
- You want me to take a look at it?
- No, you're all right.

60
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:06,556
- I've taped my share of ankles.
- Right.

61
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:12,195
Thanks.

62
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,991
Something wrong, Hurley?

63
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:21,631
No, just keeping Desmond company...

64
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:25,312
...because we're friends.

65
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,954
- Bring that back when you're done.
- Absolutely.

66
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:36,037
What the hell was that?
Do you want him to get suspicious?

67
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:37,155
Suspicious of what?

68
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,635
This is like when
you knew Claire was drowning.

69
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:44,871
That's why you got the first aid kit,
someone's gonna get hurt.

70
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:47,633
- Is it me?
- No. This is just a precaution.

71
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:51,429
Look, dude, you want me to take you
to the wire, I want an explanation.

72
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:04,752
I saw a sequence of events.
Things that are gonna happen.

73
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:10,433
- What'd you see?
- It was like a jigsaw puzzle.

74
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:12,909
Only I didn't have
the picture on the box,

75
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,195
so I don't know how
the pieces fit, exactly.

76
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:17,032
One of the pieces, the first one...

77
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:23,792
It was you pulling the cable
out of the sand.

78
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:27,839
So what're the other pieces?

79
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:31,870
If I tell you that,
it'll change the picture on the box.

80
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:36,556
So what? Isn't that the point?
Preventing something bad?

81
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:38,594
Not this time.

82
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:41,353
So you're not trying to stop
something from happening.

83
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,438
You actually want it to happen?

84
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,392
More than anything.

85
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,070
Hey, Freckles, you home?

86
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:11,274
Thought you weren't
allowed to use nicknames.

87
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:16,354
You weren't around
when I lost the bet, so you're...

88
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:19,875
...exempt.

89
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:29,154
- What's up?
- I wanted to ask you something.

90
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:30,355
Yeah?

91
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:33,839
I'm up here.

92
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,269
Did you tell him?

93
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:42,558
Did I tell who, what?

94
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:47,873
You know, did you tell the doc
about you and me?

95
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:53,831
No. But he knows.

96
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:56,794
He saw us on one of their
surveillance monitors.

97
00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:00,156
- You said the camera was broken.
- Well, they had another camera.

98
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:02,352
Those perverts.

99
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,676
Anyway, he knows.

100
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:08,360
Well, now that that's out of the way...

101
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:12,234
How about a little afternoon delight?

102
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:17,512
- That means sex.
- I know.

103
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:18,828
Come on, Freckles, wait!

104
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:23,036
- You need me to make you a mix tape?
- Yeah, why don't you do that.

105
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,915
Dude, you're gonna
have to tell me again.

106
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,515
- What do we need Jin for?
- Because he was there with us.

107
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:39,160
On the beach, when I find the cable.

108
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,069
This way.

109
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:42,275
Here it is!

110
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:45,477
- That's right.
- In one of your puzzle flashes.

111
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:53,392
So if he doesn't come,

112
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:56,950
then neither does the "someone"
you won't tell me anything about.

113
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:58,951
That'd be the long and short of it.

114
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:05,350
But I have no bloody idea how
I'm gonna get him to come with us.

115
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:07,195
Watch the master.

116
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:17,510
- Camping?
- Yeah, sleeping under the stars,

117
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,591
a fire on the beach...

118
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:21,113
Marshmallows.

119
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:24,509
Camping.

120
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:33,677
- Yes.
- Everybody likes marshmallows.

121
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:37,715
Good man. Get food, water...

122
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:40,473
- Where are you going?
- We need one more.

123
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:45,150
How daft do you think I am?

124
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:50,268
This isn't a camping trip.
You've had another vision, haven't you?

125
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:53,555
What was it this time?

126
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,912
Someone's coming to the island.

127
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:01,713
"Coming?" As in someone
who's not already here?

128
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:03,074
How is that gonna happen?

129
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,109
I can't tell you.

130
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:10,432
It's got nothing to do with me?

131
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:13,432
Well, you're a part of it,
as are Jin and Hurley.

132
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:15,033
Right, but with all due respect,

133
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:18,396
you haven't previously told Jin
or Hurley that they're gonna die.

134
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:23,788
Well, that's not gonna happen.
Not this time.

135
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:32,719
Can I bring my guitar?

136
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,399
Absolutely.

137
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:38,514
All right, I'm in.

138
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:41,752
You had me worried for a second.

139
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:12,435
This is it!

140
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,872
Well, how can you tell?

141
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:19,599
That's where I followed
the wire into the jungle.

142
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:21,388
Where is it then?

143
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:26,309
Way to go, dude!

144
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:31,474
Here it is!

145
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:35,435
<i>Here it is!</i>

146
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:40,277
Just one thing. Last time I followed
this wire into the jungle,

147
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:43,591
I almost got kebabbed by one of
Rousseau's spiky deathtrap things.

148
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:49,953
We're not going into the jungle.
Well, not yet.

149
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:53,874
It's getting late.
So we'll camp here the night.

150
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:55,952
Camp.

151
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:00,719
So when do they get here?

152
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:03,831
Your mysterious someone?

153
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:06,115
Soon.

154
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:17,712
You do realize you are free
to talk again, Brother Desmond.

155
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:22,871
Used to being quiet, I suppose.

156
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:25,510
Moriah.

157
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:30,994
I find the name the brothers
have chosen for the wine made here...

158
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:35,352
...interesting.
- And why is that, brother?

159
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:38,750
Well, Moriah is the mountain where
Abraham was asked to kill Isaac.

160
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:43,875
It's not the exactly the most
festive locale, is it?

161
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:46,155
And yet God spared Isaac.

162
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:49,712
Well, one might argue that
God need not have asked

163
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:52,234
Abraham to sacrifice his son
in the first place.

164
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:56,717
Then it wouldn't have been
much of a test, would it, brother?

165
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:59,953
Perhaps you underestimate
the value of sacrifice.

166
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:04,636
Brother Desmond,
I met this man down by the gates.

167
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:06,631
Says he needs to have a word with you.

168
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:14,079
Sorry, sir.

169
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:24,472
Forgive me, brother.

170
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:42,749
- Hey.
- Hey.

171
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:46,998
- The oatmeal's awesome.
- It is, huh?

172
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:53,590
- It's strange, huh?
- What's that?

173
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:59,239
Being back. Not looking
for a way out of a cage.

174
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:03,154
Not finding a reason to go running
off into the jungle again.

175
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:05,629
I almost don't know
what to do with myself.

176
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:10,274
Well, enjoy it. I'm sure something
will go wrong soon enough.

177
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:18,313
Well, my big,
dangerous adventure for tonight

178
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:21,551
is gonna be doing the dishes...
in the ocean.

179
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:24,948
- Be careful.
- I'll try.

180
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:31,156
- Can I borrow that spoon?
- Yeah.

181
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:38,995
Thanks.

182
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:49,789
- Good night.
- Yeah, good night.

183
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:19,591
What, my doorbell busted again?

184
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:25,793
- What the hell are you doing?
- Shut up and don't talk.

185
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:37,990
- You crying?
- I said shut up.

186
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:45,355
You got it.

187
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:40,714
Dude, I love the part about the bird.
There was a bird, right?

188
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:43,360
- You.
- Me? OK...

189
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:47,390
Have you heard the one
about the Chupacabra?

190
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:48,913
Chupa?

191
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:52,675
Yeah, it's like this bear
with spines, but Mexican...

192
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:53,715
Thanks.

193
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:57,035
Who's that?

194
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:06,439
Her name's Penny.

195
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:10,078
That's not bad, Des.
Not bad at all.

196
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:13,596
So how did you manage to
leave her behind and come here?

197
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:18,516
Because I'm a coward.

198
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:20,194
Sorry.

199
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:23,512
You and me both, pal.

200
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:28,632
You know, I tried to run away from her,
and she tracked me down.

201
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:35,191
"With enough money and determination,
you can find anyone," she said.

202
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:41,795
I used to get through my nights
thinking that she actually meant it,

203
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:44,155
that she never gave up.

204
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:47,788
That, maybe, she spent
the last three years...

205
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:50,918
...looking for me.

206
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:00,755
What's that?

207
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,468
- Is that a helicopter?
- Rescue!

208
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:26,348
Is that how a helicopter's
supposed to sound?

209
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:29,429
No.

210
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:50,789
We gotta go out there.

211
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:52,632
- Out there?
- Well, yeah.

212
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:55,154
- In what?
- Well, we gotta do something!

213
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:58,075
Look!

214
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:00,235
Look!

215
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:15,631
Oh, my God.

216
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:24,030
- Pallet?
- Nah, dude. It's not a food drop.

217
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:26,714
You saw the beacon thing.
Someone, like, ejected.

218
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:29,951
But that was a helicopter.
You can't eject from a helicopter.

219
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:33,476
Well, maybe they jumped.
All that matters is that they're here.

220
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:35,437
They?
How do we even know it's a person?

221
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:37,351
Because he said "someone" was coming.

222
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:43,875
- Where're you going?
- Out to where it fell. Let's go.

223
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:47,077
No. Whoa, slow down.
We're not going into the jungle

224
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:49,355
- in the middle of the night.
- Yes, we are.

225
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:53,549
Were you even listening to Hurley when
he mentioned Rousseau's deathtrap?

226
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:56,029
It's gonna be light in two hours,
we'll wait...

227
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:59,032
- She can't wait!
- "She?"

228
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:02,192
They! Whoever it is, could be hurt.

229
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:04,632
We have to go, all four of us. Now.

230
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:06,354
Why?

231
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:09,034
Because that's the way
it's supposed to happen.

232
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:14,598
Right, well, I guess it's
supposed to happen without me.

233
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:34,231
We'll leave at first light, then.

234
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:37,635
Together.

235
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:41,189
Terrific.

236
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:50,639
Is your sister in?

237
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:55,593
Leave. Now.

238
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:59,590
Let him be, Derek.

239
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:06,913
Hello, Ruth.

240
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:12,719
So you're a monk now, are you?

241
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:16,236
Well, technically, I'm still
a novice till the Abbot says...

242
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:17,594
Why are you here, Desmond?

243
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:22,391
Now that my initiation's done...

244
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:26,151
I felt like I owed you an explanation.

245
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:32,757
Desmond, you could never begin
to explain what you did.

246
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:35,511
You left one week before the wedding.

247
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:38,114
Everything was planned,
bought and paid for.

248
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:40,873
You just disappeared completely.

249
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:42,837
I had a calling.

250
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:46,356
We dated for six years
and the closest you ever came

251
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:49,637
to a religious experience
was Celtic winning the Cup.

252
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:53,315
Look, yes,
I was scared about the wedding.

253
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:58,474
So I had a few pints
too many maybe, and I...

254
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:01,552
I raised my eyes and I asked,

255
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:04,837
"Am I doing the right thing?"

256
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:07,673
And that's the last thing I remember.

257
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:11,389
When I woke up, I was lying
on my back in the street,

258
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:13,436
and I don't know how I got there.

259
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:17,229
And there was this man
standing over me, Ruth.

260
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:22,435
And he reached out his hand
and he said to me,

261
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:24,112
"Can I help you, brother?"

262
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:28,110
And the first thing I noticed was
the rope tied around his waist.

263
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:35,271
I looked at him and I knew.
I knew I was supposed to go with him.

264
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:41,794
I was supposed to leave
everything that mattered behind...

265
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:47,672
Sacrifice all of it
for a greater calling.

266
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:55,149
Well, it's a good thing
a bloody shepherd didn't help you up,

267
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:57,993
or I suppose you'd be off
with the sheep, wouldn't ya?

268
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:06,153
Next time you want to break up with
someone, Des, don't join a monastery.

269
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:10,909
Just tell the girl
you're too bloody scared.

270
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:21,193
You a doctor or a carpenter?

271
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:23,999
What, your dad never taught you
to use a hammer?

272
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:26,671
No, my dad taught me how to drink.

273
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:28,553
Well, it's something.

274
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:33,196
Hope I'm not interrupting.

275
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,468
You two arguing over
who's your favourite Other?

276
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:38,312
What do you want, Sawyer?

277
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,831
What I wanted, Doc, was to inform you

278
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:43,388
there's been developments
since you were AWOL.

279
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:46,355
So tell me...

280
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:51,832
How's your backhand?

281
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:55,919
Where'd you get the table?

282
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,913
Don't you recognize it? Fell out of the
purple haze after the hatch went blammo.

283
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:05,199
If we don't play every 108 minutes,
the island's gonna explode.

284
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:09,390
Finally. Something I can beat you at.

285
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:14,638
You know, considering
I haven't played since I was 12,

286
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:16,756
I wouldn't be too proud.

287
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:19,798
What is that, 18 point?

288
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:25,550
It's kinda strange, huh? Being back.

289
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:28,959
Something funny?

290
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:32,075
Kate said the same thing
in the kitchen last night.

291
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:35,716
- She did, huh?
- She did.

292
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:39,989
Nineteen point.

293
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:45,832
So you guys ate together, huh?

294
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:48,714
No, Juliet and I
had dinner together last night.

295
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:03,959
- Best two out of three?
- You got it.

296
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:10,269
- So what's next?
- Next?

297
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:13,636
Yeah, you saw the wire, the
flashy thing falling out of the sky...

298
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:15,676
Now what?
Maybe I can help you find...

299
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:18,911
That's it. There is no "next. "

300
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,718
We find the beacon.

301
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:23,268
- Why are you lying to me, mate?
- Look, mate...

302
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:25,831
I've saved your life three times now.

303
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:28,593
If that hasn't bought me your trust,
don't know what will.

304
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:31,275
Let's move.

305
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:44,197
Dude, seriously,
I'm gonna have a coronary.

306
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:46,840
Actually, you're not.
And if you don't get a move on,

307
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:50,117
- we're not gonna make it...
- Hey! Look at this!

308
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:55,395
Can't be Rousseau's.
If it was Rousseau's,

309
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:57,994
a massive rock would be
flying at my head right now.

310
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:00,949
Don't move.

311
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:02,917
- What are you doing...
- Don't move.

312
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:13,798
Did that come down with
the flashing red light thingy?

313
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:18,275
Walkie-talkie?

314
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:23,440
No, dude, that's a satellite phone!

315
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:30,113
- Crap. It's dead.
- Shocker.

316
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:38,473
Oh, my God.

317
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:40,354
Is that you?

318
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:46,434
Then who is she?

319
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:50,115
That would be Penny.

320
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:09,354
- What's this?
- Your mix tape.

321
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:15,797
Well, you gonna take it, or ain't ya?

322
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:19,598
<i>The Best of Phil Collins, huh?</i>

323
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:22,478
Don't get picky.
And if Bernard asks,

324
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:25,313
- I don't know a thing about it.
- Thanks, James.

325
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:29,151
So why'd you jump me last night?

326
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:31,839
What?

327
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:34,309
Because you saw the doc
hanging out with Juliet?

328
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:39,268
- It is not like that.
- It's not?

329
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:45,876
You ain't gotta use me, Freckles.
All you gotta do is ask.

330
00:28:56,880 --> 00:29:00,509
- You think it's her, don't you?
- Who?

331
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:04,354
Your girl, Penny.

332
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:08,157
You think it's actually her
who bailed out of the helicopter.

333
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:10,591
Earlier I hoped it.

334
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:12,557
Now I know it.

335
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:17,515
Why didn't you tell us?

336
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:22,029
- Would you've come if I had?
- Of course. Why wouldn't I?

337
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:25,870
I didn't want to tell you because...

338
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,956
...I didn't want anything to change.

339
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:30,595
Fair enough.

340
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:35,029
Look, if whatever you're seeing
leads to your girl getting us rescued,

341
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:37,554
why would we want to
change anything? Right?

342
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:39,955
Right.

343
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:49,155
Right.

344
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:57,678
Thanks for the heads-up about
bringing an umbrella, dude.

345
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:24,916
Brother Desmond...

346
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,353
What are you doing?

347
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:31,239
Well, I believe I'm getting pissed
on our lovely wine.

348
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:36,156
That bottle of our lovely wine
fetches over a hundred quid.

349
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,594
We've only bottled
a 108 cases this year.

350
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:43,877
It's just as well we've taken
a vow of poverty then, isn't it?

351
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:46,554
We've also taken a vow of charity.

352
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:50,154
Aye.

353
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:02,795
Something tells me, Desmond,
that you're not cut out to be a monk.

354
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:06,274
Well, you know,
I've had a tough week.

355
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:17,511
I'm sorry for the wine.
I'll take the penance.

356
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:20,915
I'm afraid you're
beyond penance, Desmond.

357
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:24,038
Brother Desmond.

358
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:26,559
Not anymore.

359
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:31,591
Are you... Are you firing me?

360
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:33,113
I am indeed.

361
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:37,549
You can't do that. I heard the call.

362
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:39,232
I'm sure you did hear the call.

363
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:42,153
But the Abbey, clearly,
isn't where you're meant to end up.

364
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:45,199
I have little doubt
that God has different plans

365
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:47,919
than you being a monk, Desmond.
Bigger plans.

366
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,228
Oh, I'm sure he does.

367
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:53,279
He does. You've just spent
too much time running away

368
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:56,079
to realize what you
may be running toward.

369
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:09,515
Hey!

370
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:15,918
What am I supposed to do now?

371
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:19,471
Whatever comes next.

372
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:34,109
Who's Penny?

373
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:36,910
She's a chick Desmond used to date.

374
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:39,156
Now he thinks she fell from the sky.

375
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:42,357
So we're gonna go save her life,
and she's gonna get us rescued.

376
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:50,633
Even if I spoke Korean,
it wouldn't make any sense.

377
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:54,508
Hey, we'll move faster
if we stop talking. She might be hurt.

378
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:56,871
I'm moving as fast as I can.

379
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:59,793
In case you haven't noticed,
I'm not exactly the Flash.

380
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:01,878
The Flash is pathetic.

381
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:04,994
You got something against
the fastest man alive?

382
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:06,835
You're insane, mate.

383
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:10,469
Superman can fly around the
entire planet in the blink of an eye.

384
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:12,790
Dude, if we're going by
a pure foot race,

385
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:14,711
Supes would get dusted by the Flash.

386
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:18,076
Why would the Man of Steel
agree to a sodding foot race?

387
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:19,593
For charity?

388
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:23,229
Flash would totally win, because
he can vibrate through walls and stuff.

389
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:26,676
Vibration! And what would Superman do
if he came up against a wall?

390
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:28,478
Well, no smashing allowed.

391
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:32,875
No flying, no smashing.

392
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:35,190
Any other restrictions
I need to know about?

393
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:40,668
Perhaps we should fit Superman with
a pair of kryptonite ballet slippers.

394
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:44,315
What the hell?

395
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:46,915
Charlie, duck!

396
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:00,155
Dude...

397
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:12,155
This way.

398
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:15,910
No, the beacon fell
this side of the rise.

399
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,115
No, there!

400
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,719
How about we split up?
Me and Charlie will go that way.

401
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:23,951
You and Jin go around, and we'll
meet up at that ridge over there.

402
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:26,918
You and Jin. I'll stick with Desmond.

403
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:38,909
You said "duck. "

404
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:42,189
- Sorry?
- You shouted "duck. "

405
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:48,039
You knew, even before we set off.
You knew all this time, didn't you?

406
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:50,270
- Aye.
- Why didn't you say anything?

407
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:52,749
If I'd told you the truth,
you wouldn't have come.

408
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:56,230
And you needed me to come...
because I was part of your vision.

409
00:34:56,320 --> 00:35:01,110
You thought the way you could get your
girl was if I took an arrow in the head.

410
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:04,272
- You were gonna sacrifice me!
- If the flashes don't happen

411
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:07,158
exactly how I saw them,
the picture changes.

412
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:11,230
I was supposed to let you die, Charlie.

413
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:14,835
- What's that supposed to mean?
- It means it's bloody pointless!

414
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:18,713
I keep saving your life.
And what good has it done?

415
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:23,072
It's going to keep happening. Maybe
that's the point? Maybe it's a test.

416
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:25,833
- A test?
- Like God testing Abraham!

417
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:29,879
Except I failed.
Because I changed what I saw.

418
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,798
Hey! Hey, can you hear me?

419
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:49,472
Hello!

420
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,399
Dude, she's not moving.

421
00:35:58,600 --> 00:36:02,354
I'm sorry, Penny. I'm sorry.

422
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:18,874
I was afraid you'd left
without saying goodbye.

423
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:20,279
No.

424
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:24,671
I nearly took this with me.

425
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:30,108
If you're not in a hurry,

426
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:33,829
Brother Martin's heading into town
in a few hours. He can give you a ride.

427
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:37,798
That is, if you don't mind
doing some heavy lifting.

428
00:36:40,120 --> 00:36:42,190
All ten cases are ready to go.

429
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:45,034
Desmond, there,
is just getting the last one.

430
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:47,634
Thank you, and my father
sent the check in advance.

431
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:50,075
Please thank him for his
generous donation.

432
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:51,991
Always a pleasure to see you.

433
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:56,554
Goodbye, Desmond.

434
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:05,955
I think we should be able
to fit it all in the back,

435
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:08,031
and if not, we'll
put the rest in the front.

436
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:11,475
Is that all right?

437
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:14,955
Absolutely.

438
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:28,512
You'd better drive safe, Miss.

439
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:32,550
This vineyard only makes a limited
number of these cases each year.

440
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:36,155
- Is that so?
- It's because the monks are lazy.

441
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:39,748
It's easier making
grape jelly than wine.

442
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:42,311
And how do you know
so much about monks?

443
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:44,709
- Because I'm an ex-monk.
- Really?

444
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:48,110
As of last night. I was fired.

445
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:52,198
Oh, it wasn't that funny.

446
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:55,716
I'm sorry, I've never...
I didn't know monks could be fired.

447
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:56,869
Well, they can.

448
00:37:57,600 --> 00:38:00,194
I was told in no uncertain terms that

449
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:02,794
the Abbey wasn't where
I was meant to end up.

450
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:06,429
It's just a step along a path.

451
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:09,159
God allegedly has bigger plans for me.

452
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:17,118
Something tells me
you don't entirely believe that.

453
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:20,033
- I suspect that's because I don't.
- Maybe they're right.

454
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:23,112
If you hadn't got fired,
we wouldn't have met, and then...

455
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:26,431
How could you possibly help me
unload these crates in Carlisle.

456
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:30,076
Did I say I was coming
to Carlisle with you?

457
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:31,989
Not yet.

458
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:45,119
Of course, if an ex-monk
already has plans, then...

459
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:47,430
I don't usually get into cars
with strangers.

460
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:49,829
Well, in that case, I'm Penelope.

461
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:53,029
Penny.

462
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:56,193
Desmond.

463
00:38:58,600 --> 00:39:00,079
Very nice to meet you, Penny.

464
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:11,229
She's alive!

465
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:16,552
Stand back! Get away from her!

466
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:20,870
I'm here. I'm here, Penny.

467
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:23,474
- Be careful...
- Just get off, Charlie.

468
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:25,471
Sorry, Penny, sorry...

469
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:34,068
Desmond...
