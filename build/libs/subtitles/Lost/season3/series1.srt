1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,319
<i>Previously on Lost:</i>

2
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:06,109
This is not your island.
This is our island.

3
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:10,751
<i>They've attacked us, sabotaged us,
abducted us, murdered us.</i>

4
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:14,549
<i>We're not the only people
on this island, and we all know it.</i>

5
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:17,313
<i>They came the first night,
took three of us.</i>

6
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:20,597
<i>Then they came back
and took nine more.</i>

7
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:23,433
<i>They're smart and they're animals.</i>

8
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:25,590
You're coming with us.

9
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:34,590
I burnt my hand. And my muffins.

10
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:40,719
- Still hasn't fixed your plumbing yet?
- It's a work in progress.

11
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:44,714
It's not even literature.
It's popcorn.

12
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:47,360
Why isn't it literature, Adam?
I'm dying to know.

13
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:51,638
There's no metaphor. It's religious
hokum-pokum. It's science fiction.

14
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:54,393
- Now I know why Ben isn't here.
- Excuse me?

15
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:56,675
I know the host
picks the book, but, Julie,

16
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:59,228
he wouldn't read this
in the damned bathroom.

17
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:04,030
Well, Adam, I am the host,
and I do pick the book.

18
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:06,714
And this is my favourite book,

19
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:11,476
so I am absolutely thrilled
that you can't stand it.

20
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:15,519
Silly me for sinking so low as to select
something that Ben wouldn't like.

21
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:19,593
Here I am thinking that freewill
still actually exists on...

22
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:24,198
- Whoa.
- The doorway. Get under the doorway.

23
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:17,469
Goodwin.

24
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:22,918
- You see where the tail landed?
- Probably in the water.

25
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,356
You can make that shore in an hour.
Ethan, get up to that fuselage.

26
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:28,749
There may actually be survivors.

27
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:31,593
And you're one of 'em.
A passenger. You're in shock.

28
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:34,717
Come up with a story if they ask.
Stay quiet if they don't.

29
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,756
Listen. Learn. Don't get involved.

30
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:39,070
I want lists in three days. Go.

31
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:51,158
So, I guess I'm out of the book club.

32
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,199
Hey!

33
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:30,913
Kate!

34
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:34,275
Can you hear me?

35
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:37,876
Kate!

36
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:51,278
Rise and shine, Kate.

37
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:56,309
Where am I?

38
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:59,392
You don't really think
I'm going to answer that, do you?

39
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:04,230
- Where are Sawyer and Jack?
- I'll tell you what.

40
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:08,154
Why don't you just take a nice
hot shower, wake yourself up,

41
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:10,959
wash the day off you and start fresh?

42
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:13,679
Here's a nice clean towel,
shampoo, soap...

43
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:15,990
I'm not showering in front of you.

44
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:20,834
Kate, you're not my type.

45
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:11,835
Hey.

46
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:18,679
Where are we?

47
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:22,794
Who the hell are you?

48
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,351
You ain't gonna talk to me?

49
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:31,915
What, you got
more important things to do?

50
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:05,513
<i>Warning.</i>

51
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,474
<i>Warning.</i>

52
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:19,237
I wouldn't do that.

53
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:21,515
If I want your advice, I'll ask for it.

54
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:28,992
Son of a bitch!

55
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:32,072
Told you.

56
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:57,959
Stop that.

57
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:08,355
Hi, Jack.

58
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:12,191
I'm Juliet.

59
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:25,429
Hi. I'm Jack Shephard.
I'm here for the...

60
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:28,318
Where's your lawyer?

61
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:39,079
You look pretty.

62
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:41,071
Where's your lawyer?

63
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:46,751
I fired him.

64
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:51,191
Sarah...

65
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:58,109
I'm sorry for pushing us to this place.

66
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:00,475
I know that I...

67
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:06,430
Excuse me. I'm sorry.

68
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:08,839
Yeah?

69
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:14,000
No, not yet. He just got here.

70
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:18,270
I'll call you when I get out.

71
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:28,157
- I'm gonna say this as simply as I can.
- What's his name?

72
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:30,037
- Stop it.
- I'm not gonna stop it.

73
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:32,350
I'm gonna keep asking you
until you tell me.

74
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:35,512
- I don't ask you what you do...
- Just tell me what his name is.

75
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:38,433
I wanna know who he is.

76
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:42,836
Look, you can have everything,
the cars, the house, I don't care.

77
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:46,595
I just... I just wanna know

78
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:51,879
the name of the man
that is with my wife.

79
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:13,636
Jack?

80
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:17,997
Can you hear me in there?

81
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:23,959
- Is that a yes?
- Where are my friends?

82
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:25,553
Come down from the table.

83
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:28,393
You want me to come down,
come in here and get me down.

84
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:32,473
- If you wanna talk, I'm happy to.
- Tell me where my friends are!

85
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:35,960
I will if you let go of the chain.

86
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:40,552
Do you think I'm stupid?

87
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:46,234
I don't think you're stupid, Jack.

88
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:49,153
I think you're stubborn.

89
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:19,351
Hey!

90
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:22,515
Where are my clothes?

91
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:53,676
Come on, Kate. He's waiting.

92
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:04,669
Sorry. I'm going to have to ask you
to put those on, Kate.

93
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:06,910
And if I don't?

94
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,230
Then you don't get any coffee.

95
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:25,391
A little tighter.

96
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:29,391
Please?

97
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:42,110
What did you do with Sawyer and Jack?

98
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:44,111
Now, why Sawyer?

99
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:48,430
- Why Sawyer what?
- He's the first one you asked about.

100
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:51,432
"What did you do with Sawyer and Jack"?

101
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:56,832
- You don't know me.
- Of course I don't.

102
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:03,034
- I want my clothes back.
- We burned them.

103
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:06,875
Why did you bring me here?

104
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:09,758
Why did you make me put on this dress?

105
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:11,751
Why are you feeding me breakfast?

106
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:18,195
I brought you here so you'd look out
at the water and feel comforted,

107
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:22,956
comforted that your friends
were looking out at the same ocean.

108
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:26,112
I gave you the dress
so you'd feel like a lady.

109
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:30,232
And I wanted you to eat your food
with a real live fork

110
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:32,550
and feel civilised.

111
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:39,709
I did all those things so that you'd
have something nice to hold onto.

112
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:44,032
Because, Kate,

113
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:48,238
the next two weeks
are going to be very unpleasant.

114
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:04,795
Yeah, hi. I met a woman
on the train, Sarah,

115
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:08,793
and she dropped her cell phone
and I don't even know her last name,

116
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:13,078
but your number was in her phone,
so I was just wondering...

117
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:15,230
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Forget it.

118
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:17,914
- Hey.
- Just give me a minute, Dad.

119
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:22,551
I asked you to give me a minute here.

120
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:28,158
What's this? Why are you dialling
all the numbers on Sarah's cell phone?

121
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:32,631
- Because one of them is him.
- You gotta stop this, Jack. It's over.

122
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:35,473
Not until I know his name,

123
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:38,518
where he works, where he lives,
when they first kissed.

124
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:41,398
I wanna know what it is about him.

125
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:52,554
Why is Sarah calling you, Dad?

126
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:56,593
I think it's time that you let this go.

127
00:17:56,680 --> 00:18:00,389
- Why is she calling you?
- Because she was afraid for you.

128
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:03,552
I wanna know exactly
why the hell she was calling.

129
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:05,915
You were slipping, losing your grip.

130
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:10,516
- My grip is not the problem here.
- Which is exactly what's happening.

131
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:13,319
I think I know something
about being obsessive.

132
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:18,599
No. Being a drunk is not obsessive.

133
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:32,791
Let it go, Jack.

134
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:07,031
What?

135
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:12,270
If you're trying to talk to me,
I can't hear you.

136
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:15,318
<i>Let it go, Jack.</i>

137
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:21,439
I know you're hungry.
I brought this for you.

138
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:25,231
This is how it will work.

139
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:29,552
You sit there, across from the door,
back against the wall.

140
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:32,996
I open the door and leave the tray.

141
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:35,150
Can I trust you to do that, Jack?

142
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:40,958
- I don't want your food.
- It's a delicious sandwich.

143
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:45,318
Tell the guy who's trying to talk to me
through that intercom he can give it up!

144
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:50,713
Maybe you're hungrier than you think.
That intercom hasn't worked in years.

145
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:55,631
What's that for?
The button, what's it for?

146
00:19:56,440 --> 00:20:00,194
- It's for emergencies.
- Who's watching me?

147
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:04,671
Are you going to sit against the wall
so I can open the door?

148
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:07,558
It's just off the frying pan.

149
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:09,551
You can have it.

150
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:19,758
What do you do, Jack?
What's your profession?

151
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:22,229
I'm a repo man.

152
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:25,551
You know, when people don't pay
their bills, I go in for the bank

153
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:27,995
and I collect their possessions.

154
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:30,594
I'm a people person,
so I really love it.

155
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:32,477
Are you married?

156
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:36,473
No. I never saw the point.

157
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:38,790
What about you?

158
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:42,919
What's your job,
besides making sandwiches?

159
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:46,595
I didn't make it.
I just put the toothpicks in.

160
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:55,239
When your plane crashed,
where were you flying from?

161
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:04,879
Sydney.

162
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:07,834
What were you doing there?

163
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:10,150
I was bringing my father home.

164
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:14,916
- Why go all the way to Australia to...
- Because he was dead.

165
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:18,676
I'm sorry.

166
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:22,996
Yeah, I'm sure you are.

167
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:25,196
Thanks.

168
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:34,916
You can trust me, Jack.

169
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:38,515
I'm not gonna hurt you.

170
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:49,510
What the hell is going on here?

171
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:15,553
Hey!

172
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:21,192
Hey, how long would it take
to get to your camp?

173
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:23,919
What, you're talking to me now, Chachi?

174
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:27,715
From where they got you,
how long a walk was it?

175
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:29,791
Day? Two days?

176
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:32,519
Hey, what are the people like,
from your plane?

177
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:35,034
They're just awesome.

178
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:38,476
Last one of you boys came for a visit
got tortured by our Iraqi.

179
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:40,949
He tortured me, too.

180
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:44,271
But, hell, you don't know any better.

181
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:48,669
<i>Subject escape.</i>

182
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:49,749
- Hey
- Whoa.

183
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:52,035
<i>Subject escape. Subject escape.</i>

184
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:55,556
Hey, how'd you get out of there?

185
00:22:58,280 --> 00:22:59,508
- Run that way.
- Hold on.

186
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:01,511
You run that way.

187
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:18,991
Hey.

188
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:52,718
Say it. Say it, Karl.

189
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:56,920
I'm... sorry...

190
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:02,838
...sorry I involved you
in my breakout attempt.

191
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:33,269
The drugs we gave you
when we brought you here

192
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:36,477
have a fairly serious side effect:
Dehydration.

193
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:39,074
Your head is probably sore,
your throat is raw,

194
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:41,435
and if you don't eat or drink
something soon,

195
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:43,590
you're going to start hallucinating.

196
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:48,950
So you're a doctor, huh?

197
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:53,675
No. I'm a repo woman.

198
00:24:57,240 --> 00:25:00,869
No strings attached.
You don't have to answer any questions.

199
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:02,757
You don't have to do anything

200
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:05,308
but sit with your back
up against the far wall,

201
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:08,278
let me open that door,
put the plate down and leave.

202
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:13,431
I know it feels like you're giving up,

203
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:17,229
like you're losing
if you do anything that I ask you to,

204
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:19,470
but you're not.

205
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:21,551
You need to eat.

206
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:27,271
What do you say?

207
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:03,271
Thank you, Jack.

208
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:14,038
Let's take out the epidural catheter
and get him started on a PCA.

209
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:17,155
Excuse me for just a second.

210
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:20,277
You sure he's ready
to self-administer his pain meds?

211
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:22,271
Hello?

212
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:32,991
Dr Shephard?

213
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:37,590
Yeah. Bye.

214
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:17,832
- Jack?
- Give me your cell phone.

215
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:19,990
- What? What?
- I wanna see it. Now.

216
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:24,676
Look where you are, Jack.
Just look around you. Please.

217
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:26,958
- OK?
- Give me the phone.

218
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:29,508
This is not the place for this.

219
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:33,388
You must be Jack.
Why don't you grab a chair, join us?

220
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:42,548
You... you know me?

221
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:45,473
Yes. Your father's told us
all about you.

222
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:48,996
What's he told you about me?
What'd you tell them about me, Dad?

223
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:52,755
That your son never really had it?
Not like the old man.

224
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:58,476
I didn't have the will to make it work?
My life? My job?

225
00:27:58,560 --> 00:28:03,156
My marriage? What'd you tell them
about my marriage, Dad?

226
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:06,354
You know how he manages his marriage?

227
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:08,829
A bottle of Scotch every night
before dinner.

228
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:11,718
Your father has been sober 50 days now.

229
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:15,475
We're very proud of that.

230
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:22,553
Wow, Dad. I wonder what helped you
turn that corner?

231
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:27,668
Think maybe it was a new lady friend?
You think maybe that's what it was?

232
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:31,719
- I will not let you talk to me this...
- I will not let you sleep with my wife.

233
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:37,389
Oh, Jack. Jack, I'm your father.

234
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:39,869
Jack, please, just let it go.

235
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:06,394
- Which way out?
- Don't do this, Jack.

236
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:08,630
Don't... Don't...

237
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:22,750
- No!
- Open the door.

238
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:25,308
- I can't. I do that, we die.
- You're lying to me.

239
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:27,038
- I'm not.
- Open the door!

240
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:30,556
- I can't. I swear I can't.
- She's telling the truth, Jack.

241
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:37,156
I swear to God, I will kill her.

242
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:39,429
OK.

243
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:47,355
Have her open the door
and she dies anyway. We all do.

244
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,877
No!

245
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:23,994
Jack! Over here!

246
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:45,276
- The button!
- What?

247
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:47,794
The yellow button! The button!

248
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:15,551
Come here.

249
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:46,396
<i>Warning.</i>

250
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:54,115
Gotcha, Doc Brown!

251
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:57,835
<i>Reward. Reward.</i>

252
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:05,352
Come on.

253
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:12,511
Unbelievable.

254
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:24,910
Keep moving.

255
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:47,196
Stick your hands out through the bars,
I'll take off your cuffs.

256
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:50,192
Scratched you up pretty bad,
didn't they?

257
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:54,717
- I'll bring you some antiseptic later.
- How about you bring me an ottoman?

258
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:57,075
While you're at it,
I could use a blow-dry.

259
00:32:57,160 --> 00:33:02,234
Hey, you got yourself a fish biscuit.
How'd you do that?

260
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:05,232
I figured out your complicated gizmos,
that's how.

261
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:08,073
Only took the bears two hours.

262
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:12,154
How many of 'em were there?

263
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:16,877
You OK, Freckles?

264
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:22,556
Yeah.

265
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:25,677
- You?
- Just swell.

266
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:29,876
I requested that cage, but whatever.

267
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:40,672
Nice dress.

268
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:43,274
They made me wear it.

269
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:52,953
You hungry?

270
00:34:39,640 --> 00:34:43,030
It's an aquarium.

271
00:34:43,720 --> 00:34:46,632
- Excuse me?
- This thing's for what,

272
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:51,434
- sharks?
- Dolphins, too.

273
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:03,029
- We're underwater, aren't we?
- Yes.

274
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:08,915
Is this one of their stations,
the Dharma Initiative?

275
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,911
They called it the Hydra.

276
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:15,349
So you people are just...

277
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:19,388
...whatever's left over of them?

278
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:23,918
Well, that was a long time ago.

279
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:32,191
It doesn't matter who we were.

280
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:35,317
It only matters who we are.

281
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:38,634
We know exactly who you are,
Jack Shephard.

282
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:41,669
You don't know anything about me.

283
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:44,271
I know that you're a spinal surgeon

284
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:47,636
based out of St. Sebastian's Hospital
in Los Angeles.

285
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:49,278
I know you went to Columbia

286
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:53,273
and you graduated med school
a year faster than anyone else.

287
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:56,750
I know that you were married only once

288
00:35:56,840 --> 00:35:59,115
and that you contested the divorce.

289
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:04,197
I know your father died in Sydney.

290
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:09,354
I know this because
I have a copy of his autopsy report.

291
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:14,031
How...

292
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,389
- How did you get...
- We got it.

293
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:23,194
What is that?

294
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:29,235
This, Jack, is your life.

295
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:33,990
Do you?

296
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:39,108
Is it just about me or is it about
my family, too? My... my friends?

297
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:41,953
It's pretty much about everything.

298
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:49,831
Do you know about my...
about my ex-wife?

299
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:51,148
Sarah.

300
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:57,396
Yes, Jack. We know all about her.

301
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:03,318
What would you like to find out?

302
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:09,678
Get ready for the lockdown.

303
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:12,832
Shephard. Someone posted your bail.

304
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:30,709
- How'd you?
- Your dad told me you were here.

305
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:37,189
I called you a cab.

306
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:41,114
So, goodbye.

307
00:37:56,680 --> 00:37:59,592
- Sarah.
- What?

308
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:01,993
Is that him?

309
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:04,594
- What difference does it make?
- It just does.

310
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:09,754
I wanna know. I need to know who he is.

311
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:13,469
It doesn't matter who he is.
It just matters who you're not.

312
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:24,517
Jack, your father,
when he called me,

313
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:28,275
to help you,

314
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:31,796
he was so drunk
I could hardly understand him.

315
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:41,835
Look at the bright side.

316
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:45,590
Now you have something to fix.

317
00:38:58,160 --> 00:38:59,878
<i>Jack.</i>

318
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:05,636
Jack, what would you like to find out?

319
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:12,471
Is she...

320
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:16,556
Is she happy?

321
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:23,270
Yes, Jack, she's very happy.

322
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:38,791
Now, I'd like to bring you
some food and water.

323
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:43,158
But this time I need to know
that you'll behave.

324
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:45,629
Can I trust you, Jack?

325
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:56,193
Put your back against the wall, please.

326
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:29,835
Good work, Juliet.

327
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:35,193
Thank you, Ben.
