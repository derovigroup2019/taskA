1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:02,070
<i>Previously on "Lost"...</i>

2
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:03,650
I don't know how it happened,

3
00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:07,250
but you seem to have some
communion with this island,

4
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:10,910
John,and that makes you very,
very important.

5
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:13,330
In time,you'll have a better
understanding of things.

6
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:18,100
Kwon is pregnant.

7
00:00:18,110 --> 00:00:19,380
<i>The fetus is healthy--</i>

8
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:23,740
- What's that?
- Juliet is gathering information
for us at your former camp.

9
00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:26,030
She's determining if any
of the women are pregnant.

10
00:00:26,050 --> 00:00:29,640
Then we're gonna go in and...
take them.

11
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:33,240
Juliet is a mole.
She's working for Ben.

12
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:38,240
- We're moving.
- Moving? Where are we going?

13
00:00:38,260 --> 00:00:39,760
<i>We are not going
anywhere, John.</i>

14
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:41,990
You are going to stay behind.

15
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:44,100
We'll leave a trail--
One you can track.

16
00:00:44,110 --> 00:00:46,820
And,John,
unless you're carrying

17
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:48,470
your father's body
on your back...

18
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:50,960
Don't bother.

19
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:58,790
Come on! Damn it,push!

20
00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:04,870
Something's wrong. I can't...

21
00:01:07,970 --> 00:01:08,750
Emily-- it's not coming!

22
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:11,470
You can do this! Now push!

23
00:01:11,690 --> 00:01:14,730
-Come on. Come on,baby.
-You can do it. Now come on.

24
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:15,920
Come on.

25
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:17,690
There you go! Come on!

26
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:19,170
Aah!

27
00:01:20,290 --> 00:01:21,240
Aah!

28
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:25,320
It's a boy.

29
00:01:26,890 --> 00:01:27,680
You did it.

30
00:01:29,910 --> 00:01:30,790
It hurts.

31
00:01:37,970 --> 00:01:39,860
Oh,you did it.

32
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:45,180
Roger,it hurts.

33
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:53,520
Emily,no one knows
we're out here.

34
00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:55,160
We gotta get back,
okay,honey?

35
00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:56,700
Can you hold on to the baby?

36
00:01:57,660 --> 00:01:59,750
Emily,can you hold the baby?

37
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:01,430
Hold him tight.

38
00:02:12,970 --> 00:02:14,620
Hey!

39
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:17,470
Help! Help!

40
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:18,730
Help!

41
00:02:20,530 --> 00:02:21,480
Help!

42
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:25,520
Come on. Help me.

43
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:28,040
Hey,what happened,man?

44
00:02:29,490 --> 00:02:31,970
We were hiking.
She went into labor,

45
00:02:31,990 --> 00:02:33,780
and she wasn't due yet.
She's bleeding.

46
00:02:33,790 --> 00:02:36,220
-Okay. Okay,look. We'll put her in the car,okay? 
-Okay.

47
00:02:36,230 --> 00:02:37,430
We're gonna get you
to the hospital.

48
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,330
-Oh,okay. 
-Okay,honey.

49
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:41,860
-Okay,it's all right.
Let's keep her warm. All right?

50
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:44,640
-How's the baby?
-Fine,i guess. I don't know.

51
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:47,000
Roger...

52
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,170
-Roger...
-i'm right here.

53
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:50,810
Call him Benjamin...

54
00:02:51,770 --> 00:02:52,680
Stay with me.

55
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:58,730
Stay with me. Emily!

56
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:04,420
Emily! Oh,god,no!

57
00:03:12,850 --> 00:03:13,740
What you got there?

58
00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:15,930
It's a birthday present.

59
00:03:16,690 --> 00:03:18,360
Mine just happens
to be today.

60
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:22,080
You do remember birthdays,
don't you,Richard?

61
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:26,670
So do you want me to bring the,
uh, tape back to Juliet?

62
00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:28,870
What?

63
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:31,000
The tape with your
instructions for Juliet--

64
00:03:31,010 --> 00:03:32,740
Do you want me to bring it back
to the medical station?

65
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:34,930
I recorded it yesterday
before we left.

66
00:03:34,950 --> 00:03:36,640
-I thought you already took it. 
-No.

67
00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:39,070
Where's Tom?

68
00:03:41,330 --> 00:03:42,240
Tom!

69
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:44,840
Have you seen
my recorder?

70
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:13,220
You said that if i killed
my father,

71
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:16,070
you'd tell me everything
i wanted to know

72
00:04:16,090 --> 00:04:17,090
about the island.

73
00:04:22,490 --> 00:04:24,480
So why don't you start
at the beginning?

---"LOST" Season 03 Episode 20---
<i> "The Man Behind the Curtain"</i>

74
00:04:46,110 --> 00:04:48,070
I know i promised to
tell you everything,John,

75
00:04:49,130 --> 00:04:49,950
and i wish it was as simple

76
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:52,600
as me taking out a dusty
old book and opening it up.

77
00:05:04,610 --> 00:05:05,990
But it's not that simple.

78
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,260
How about you just tell me?

79
00:05:09,670 --> 00:05:10,580
You probably think

80
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,330
i'm the leader of
this little community,

81
00:05:13,310 --> 00:05:14,840
but that's not entirely true.

82
00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:18,840
We all answer
to someone,John.

83
00:05:18,850 --> 00:05:20,510
And who might that be?

84
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:24,180
His name is Jacob.

85
00:05:25,790 --> 00:05:28,000
Okay,then. Take me to Jacob.

86
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:29,130
I can't do that.

87
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:34,490
-Where are you going?
-Hell,Ben,if you don't want to take me,

88
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:37,500
maybe someone else will.
I'll just go and ask Richard.

89
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:40,060
Why would Richard take you?
He doesn't know where Jacob is.

90
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:42,250
-He doesn't talk to Jacob.
-Well,who talk to him?

91
00:05:42,270 --> 00:05:44,150
-I do. 
-Oh,you're the only
one who talks to him?

92
00:05:44,170 --> 00:05:46,710
-That's right. 
-And no one else knows where he is?

93
00:05:47,350 --> 00:05:49,570
I was born here on this island.

94
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:51,900
I'm one of the last that was.

95
00:05:51,910 --> 00:05:54,520
Most of these people you see--
i brought them here,

96
00:05:54,530 --> 00:05:56,680
<i>so Jacob talks to me,John.</i>

97
00:05:57,250 --> 00:05:58,780
<i>He tells me what to do,</i>

98
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,140
<i>Trusts me.</i>

99
00:06:00,570 --> 00:06:04,420
And no one else
has ever seen him?

100
00:06:04,890 --> 00:06:05,570
That's right.

101
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:07,580
How convenient.

102
00:06:08,530 --> 00:06:09,680
You know what i think,Ben?

103
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:12,100
I think there is no Jacob.

104
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:14,590
I think your people are idiots

105
00:06:14,610 --> 00:06:17,340
if they believe you take
orders from someone else.

106
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:20,200
<i>You are the man behind
the curtain...</i>

107
00:06:21,910 --> 00:06:23,250
the Wizard of Oz...

108
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:26,720
and you're a liar.

109
00:06:28,950 --> 00:06:30,940
And what might you based
that theory on, John?

110
00:06:31,470 --> 00:06:33,210
Because if you were
telling the truth,

111
00:06:34,590 --> 00:06:36,290
your hand wouldn't be shaking.

112
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:14,710
Namaste.

113
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:17,170
Thanks.

114
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:18,290
Namaste.

115
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:21,830
Hey, Welcome to
the island,man.

116
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:23,010
Namaste.

117
00:07:24,170 --> 00:07:26,190
So what do you think?

118
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:29,410
Wow,this is some place.

119
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:31,700
Thanks again for the
opportunity, Mr. Goodspeed.

120
00:07:31,710 --> 00:07:32,910
Horace,please.

121
00:07:32,930 --> 00:07:34,880
Horace. And this must be Ben.

122
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:38,070
-Yeah. 
-Mr. Goodspeed was there the day you were born.

123
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:39,250
Yes,i was.

124
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:43,450
-He's doing us a big favor here.
-He gave your old man a job.

125
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:46,530
Uh he don't say much.

126
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:49,420
That's okay. 
I bet he will when he has something to say,

127
00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:50,280
Right,Ben?

128
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:53,740
Hey,you hungry,kiddo? Huh?

129
00:07:54,530 --> 00:07:57,760
-Huh? 
-Great. All right, well,i tell you what.

130
00:07:57,780 --> 00:07:59,910
After you're done processing,
we'll have some lunch.

131
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:01,640
-How's that sound?
-Uh,thank you.

132
00:08:02,110 --> 00:08:03,190
You're gonna love it here.

133
00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:06,100
<i>Welcome to the Island.</i>

134
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:08,510
<i>For your own comfort
and safety,</i>

135
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:10,580
<i>we ask that you stay

136
00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:12,060
<i>of your new living
quarters.</i>

137
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:13,930
<i>Our barracks
are surrounded</i>

138
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:16,120
<i>by a high-frequency
sonar fence</i>

139
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:17,150
<i>to protect us</i>

140
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:20,090
<i>from the island's abundant
and diverse wildlife.</i>

141
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:23,070
<i>You are now a member of
the Dharma initiative.</i>

142
00:08:23,710 --> 00:08:24,670
What kind of wildlife

143
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:26,570
you think this fence is
protecting us from?

144
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:29,220
-Roger Linus? 
-Roger Linus. Yeah.

145
00:08:30,410 --> 00:08:32,070
<i>Every morning you will
be given a new code</i>

146
00:08:32,090 --> 00:08:34,400
<i>which will allow you to
cross outside the fences</i>

00:08:34,770 --> 00:08:36,240

148
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:38,040
<i>There are properties

149
00:08:38,060 --> 00:08:39,820

00:08:40,350 --> 00:08:42,840
<i>Our mission is to study
these properties</i>

151
00:08:42,850 --> 00:08:44,350
<i>for the betterment

154
00:08:50,070 --> 00:08:52,320
<i>Should you be assigned
Ological study...</i>

155
00:08:52,890 --> 00:08:56,020
Hey. You're new,huh?

156
00:08:58,510 --> 00:08:59,490
I'm Annie.

157
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:02,470
Want one?

158
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:07,930
We can have as many
as we want.

159
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:10,620
"Work man"?

160
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:13,790
<i>What is this? Work man?</i>

161
00:09:16,090 --> 00:09:17,230
<i>I'm a Janitor?</i>

162
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:21,030
- I'm sorry,Mr. Linus. Goodspeed
told me you people were
doing experiments,

163
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:22,220
Changing the world.

164
00:09:22,230 --> 00:09:23,990
I didn't come here to
clean up after you.

165
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,380
Look,if anything else opens up,

166
00:09:25,390 --> 00:09:27,110
you can feel free
to apply for it.

167
00:09:30,510 --> 00:09:31,360
Come on.

168
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:35,490
You don't think it's too big?

169
00:09:35,510 --> 00:09:38,150
Dude,be honest. It can't
be worse than Haggis.

170
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:41,730
Oh,i could go for some
Haggis right now.

171
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:44,390
Hey,Sayid.

172
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:50,440
What happened to you?

173
00:09:50,450 --> 00:09:53,580
-I was with Locke.
-Well,where is he?

174
00:09:54,110 --> 00:09:54,960
He went back.

175
00:09:55,630 --> 00:09:58,790
-Back where? 
-With them.-Don't ask me where the hell it is,

176
00:09:58,810 --> 00:10:00,080
'cause it don't matter right now.

177
00:10:00,810 --> 00:10:03,780
What does matter... is this...

178
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:15,020
Where is Ben?!

179
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:16,890
Where is he?!

180
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:23,560
I thought you were dead.

181
00:10:25,690 --> 00:10:28,170
I'm fortunate the Pylons
were not set to a lethal level.

182
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:33,760
<i>What is he doing here?</i>

183
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:35,930
It's all right.

184
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:37,250
He's the one who
tried to kill me.

185
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:41,530
He's with us now.

186
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:44,620
Where have you been, Mikhail?

187
00:10:44,630 --> 00:10:47,110
I encountered several
of his people in the jungle.

188
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:49,600
They had an injured
woman with them.

189
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:52,750
Apparently,she had just
parachuted onto the island.

190
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:54,980
-What? -Her helo
crashed in the water.

191
00:10:56,140 --> 00:10:59,150
She says her ship is
approximately 130 clicks

192
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:00,500
to the west of us.

193
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:03,080
She has a radio-telephone.
Where is she now?

194
00:11:03,690 --> 00:11:05,610
I assume they have taken
her back to their camp.

195
00:11:07,030 --> 00:11:09,080
We'll be visiting their camp
day after tomorrow.

196
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:12,330
-We'll take care of it then.
-Day after tomorrow?
-We have to go now.

197
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:16,450
-Ben's not going
anywhere with you.
-Excuse me?

198
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:18,520
He and i are going
to see Jacob.

199
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:27,730
Please tell me this
isn't true,Benjamin.

200
00:11:34,470 --> 00:11:36,420
Sorry. I have to deal
with this now, John.

201
00:11:36,430 --> 00:11:38,260
Our excursion wi have to wait.

202
00:11:40,130 --> 00:11:43,330
Since when do you explain
yourself to him--an outsider?

203
00:11:46,950 --> 00:11:47,700
Tom.

204
00:11:49,570 --> 00:11:50,490
Richard?!

205
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:04,240
So when do we leave?

206
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:10,810
You know,you didn't have
to beat Mikhail senseless

207
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:12,190
to make your point, John.

208
00:12:13,570 --> 00:12:14,420
Yes,i did.

209
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:16,490
Locke...

210
00:12:21,630 --> 00:12:23,320
i hear you're
gonna go see Jacob.

211
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:25,950
You're gonna need this.

212
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:34,800
Thanks.

213
00:12:42,190 --> 00:12:43,330
Happy birthday,Dad.

214
00:12:57,700 --> 00:13:01,060
So once water is added
to the bicarbonate,

215
00:13:01,070 --> 00:13:03,970
we will get our very
own volcanic reaction.

216
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:06,470
Yes.

217
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:08,840
<i>Is that what happened to</i>
the volcano on this island?

218
00:13:08,850 --> 00:13:12,500
Exactly,Annie,
but that was a long time ago.

219
00:13:13,030 --> 00:13:15,220
Okay,let's get ourselves
an eruption.

220
00:13:15,230 --> 00:13:16,280
Oh,cool!

221
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:19,660
Just add water,and voila!! Wow!

222
00:13:19,670 --> 00:13:21,400
Now i know it's not lava,but--

223
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:24,320
what was that?!

224
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:27,930
Oh,no. They're coming.

225
00:13:29,210 --> 00:13:31,340
Okay,everyone,
into your positions.

226
00:13:31,590 --> 00:13:32,660
Everyone,get down! Hurry!

227
00:13:32,670 --> 00:13:33,740
Get over here!

228
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:35,910
That's right,all together.

229
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:38,530
Annie,lock the back door,
please.

230
00:13:39,490 --> 00:13:40,120
Come on!

231
00:13:40,130 --> 00:13:42,250
He's just sitting there!

232
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:45,230
Ben,come on,honey,
you gotta move. Ben!

233
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:51,160
Come on.

234
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:52,929
Uhh!

235
00:13:52,930 --> 00:13:53,720
Come on!

236
00:13:57,910 --> 00:13:59,830
Don't worry.
It's just the hostiles.

237
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:02,650
We'll be okay.

238
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:05,320
Get down!

239
00:14:09,410 --> 00:14:11,270
Hey,man,i heard you ran
into a little trouble.

240
00:14:11,670 --> 00:14:13,270
We were driving
back from the plane,

241
00:14:13,290 --> 00:14:15,050
and we hear
this huge explosion.

242
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:17,840
Next thing i know,
there's a siren wailing,

243
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:19,920
and we're driving through
the middle of a shootout.

244
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:22,840
Look,we're having some
skirmishes with the natives.

245
00:14:22,850 --> 00:14:24,320
What do you mean,natives?

246
00:14:24,330 --> 00:14:26,650
Well,we're not exactly sure
who they are.

247
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:28,490
Well,this ain't what
i signed up for.

248
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:31,310
Roger, i did you a favor,man.

249
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:33,180
You were having trouble
finding work,

250
00:14:33,190 --> 00:14:36,250
and don't forget about Ben.
He's getting a quality education.

251
00:14:36,270 --> 00:14:38,190
I don't give a damn
about his education.

252
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:40,520
If i'm gonna get shot at,
i want hazard pay.

253
00:14:40,530 --> 00:14:43,300
-I want another 30 grand.
-Calm down,man.

254
00:14:43,310 --> 00:14:45,400
And don't try to tell me
you don't have it.

255
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:49,950
You hear me?
Now get the hell out
of my house.

256
00:14:52,870 --> 00:14:53,690
Uhh!

257
00:15:01,660 --> 00:15:03,230
I thought i told you
to go to bed.

258
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:32,350
She's not here.

259
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:34,290
I noticed.

260
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:35,910
What are you doing?

261
00:15:36,370 --> 00:15:37,290
Looking for Juliet.

262
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:40,040
Well,you're not gonna
find her in there.

263
00:15:40,050 --> 00:15:42,860
-She left with jack.
-Juliet left with jack?

264
00:15:42,870 --> 00:15:45,190
He took off right after
i told him about Naomi.

265
00:15:45,570 --> 00:15:46,350
Who's Naomi?

266
00:15:47,020 --> 00:15:48,650
And why would you
do that,Kate?

267
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:51,110
Because she's hurt,
because he's a doctor

268
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,560
and because he has
a right to know.

269
00:15:53,670 --> 00:15:54,530
Where is he now?

270
00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:57,570
-I don't know,Sayid.
-Of course you don't.

271
00:15:57,580 --> 00:16:00,680
It might be time for you to
tell everybody else
about Naomi,too.

272
00:16:00,690 --> 00:16:01,870
Play her the tape.

273
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:04,490
What tape?

274
00:16:11,260 --> 00:16:12,860
There's something you
should know,John,
before we go.

275
00:16:15,780 --> 00:16:17,740
Whether or not you think
he's the Wizard of Oz,

276
00:16:18,470 --> 00:16:21,530
i can assure you that
Jacob is very,very real.

277
00:16:25,130 --> 00:16:26,370
And we're gonna go see him,

278
00:16:26,390 --> 00:16:28,120
and he's not gonna like it.

279
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:32,500
In fact,i have a feeling
he's gonna be very... angry.

280
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:37,280
And that's why my
hand was shaking,

281
00:16:37,310 --> 00:16:39,420
because this is not
a man you go and see.

282
00:16:40,870 --> 00:16:42,860
This is a man who summons you.

283
00:16:45,940 --> 00:16:48,060
Well,i guess there's a
first time for everythg.

284
00:17:28,550 --> 00:17:29,310
It's us.

285
00:17:30,490 --> 00:17:31,890
That's you,and that's me.

286
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:37,400
Now we never have to
be away from each other.

287
00:17:42,890 --> 00:17:44,100
Happy birthday,Ben.

288
00:17:46,390 --> 00:17:47,270
Thanks.

289
00:17:47,650 --> 00:17:48,500
You're welcome.

290
00:18:35,510 --> 00:18:36,840
It's your birthday.

291
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:41,550
Sorry i forgot.

292
00:18:46,130 --> 00:18:47,470
It's kinda hard to celebrate

293
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:49,140
on the day you
killed your mom.

294
00:18:51,270 --> 00:18:52,630
She was just seven
months pregnant.

295
00:18:52,630 --> 00:18:53,700
We went for a hike,

296
00:18:55,220 --> 00:18:56,850
but you had to come early.

297
00:18:59,370 --> 00:19:00,940
Now she's gone...

298
00:19:03,170 --> 00:19:06,820
<i>and i'm stuck here on
this island... with you.</i>

299
00:19:18,790 --> 00:19:20,420
Happy birthday,Ben.

300
00:19:46,530 --> 00:19:47,320
Mom?

301
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:54,570
<i>Ben,don't!</i>

302
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:00,200
Mom!

303
00:20:00,830 --> 00:20:02,560
<i>It's not time yet,Benjamin.</i>

304
00:20:10,790 --> 00:20:11,570
Mom!

305
00:20:51,570 --> 00:20:52,590
Let's go,John.

306
00:20:55,430 --> 00:20:56,220
<i>John.</i>

307
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:06,430
So,what,the whole world
thinks we're dead?

308
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:08,970
-That's not important right now.
-Not important?

309
00:21:08,970 --> 00:21:11,030
-What do you mean,
it's not important,Sayid?
-Excuse me.

310
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:14,890
<i>-I'm sorry. -Don't you people
want to be rescued?</i>

311
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:17,160
We kept her a secret
to keep her safe.

312
00:21:17,170 --> 00:21:18,380
Safe from what,Sayid?

313
00:21:18,390 --> 00:21:22,400
Safe from Jack. He spent
a week with the others,

314
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:24,370
and he brought one of
them back with him,

315
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:26,930
here,amongst us,

316
00:21:27,990 --> 00:21:30,150
and every time we try to get
answers from this woman,

317
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:31,990
he prevents her
from giving them.

318
00:21:32,590 --> 00:21:33,600
But it's Jack.

319
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:36,620
He would never do
anything to hurt us.

320
00:21:37,540 --> 00:21:41,390
-And Juliet-- i believe
she's a good person.
-Good person,huh?

321
00:21:42,090 --> 00:21:45,060
-You're basing that on what?
-Wouldn't involve her taking you

322
00:21:45,070 --> 00:21:46,340
to one of their medical stations,

323
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:51,150
would it now, Mrs. Kwon?
-How...

324
00:21:51,170 --> 00:21:52,970
<i>Kwon is pregnant.</i>

325
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:55,140
<i>The fetus is healthy and</i>
was conceived  island

326
00:21:55,150 --> 00:21:57,820
<i>with her husband. He was</i>
sterile before they got here.

327
00:21:57,830 --> 00:22:00,180
<i>I'm still working on getting samples</i>

328
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:02,550
<i>from the other women.</i>
-I should have Austen's soon.

329
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:04,450
<i>I'll report back when i know more.</i>

330
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:05,730
Where'd you get that?

331
00:22:08,290 --> 00:22:09,460
<i>Where have you been,Jack?</i>

332
00:22:09,470 --> 00:22:10,840
I asked you where you got it.

333
00:22:11,050 --> 00:22:12,290
You really think
you're in a position

334
00:22:12,310 --> 00:22:14,360
<i>to be asking us questions?
Turn the tape over.</i>

335
00:22:14,370 --> 00:22:16,850
-Stay out of it. 
-You wanna burn me at the stake? Here i am.

336
00:22:16,870 --> 00:22:19,670
But first,turn the tape over.
Press "play."

337
00:22:30,510 --> 00:22:31,590
<i>Juliet,it's Ben.</i>

338
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:34,310
<i>I'm sending three teams</i>
to extract Kwon

339
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:35,920
<i>the night after tomorrow.</i>

340
00:22:35,930 --> 00:22:37,880
<i>Won't have time to run</i>
Austen's sample,

341
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:40,810
<i>so if you determine that
she or anyone else is pregnant,</i>

342
00:22:40,820 --> 00:22:43,950
<i>mark their tents,
and we'll take them,too.</i>

343
00:22:45,660 --> 00:22:46,440
<i>Good luck.</i>

344
00:22:53,150 --> 00:22:55,300
The night i saw your
baby on the ultrasound,

345
00:22:55,730 --> 00:22:57,730
i told Jack what they
were making me do.

346
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:01,630
Why didn't you tell us?

347
00:23:03,070 --> 00:23:05,130
Because i hadn't decided
what to do about it yet.

348
00:23:05,990 --> 00:23:06,870
"Yet?"

349
00:23:14,710 --> 00:23:16,170
I think we got some
catching up to do.

350
00:24:32,490 --> 00:24:33,100
Mom?

351
00:24:40,670 --> 00:24:41,370
Mom?

352
00:24:44,370 --> 00:24:45,070
Mom!

353
00:24:46,150 --> 00:24:47,260
<i>Mom!</i>

354
00:24:47,990 --> 00:24:49,190
Mom!

355
00:25:08,930 --> 00:25:09,720
Whoa,whoa,whoa,whoa.

356
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:11,650
Whoa,whoa,hey,hey.

357
00:25:12,780 --> 00:25:14,020
Whoa,i didn't mean to scare you.

358
00:25:14,030 --> 00:25:15,360
-Wait,wait. -Are you lost? Wait.

359
00:25:19,390 --> 00:25:20,470
Are you one of them?

360
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:22,510
One of who?

361
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:24,340
A hostile.

362
00:25:27,790 --> 00:25:29,110
Do you even know what
that word means?

363
00:25:30,710 --> 00:25:31,470
What's your name?

364
00:25:32,260 --> 00:25:33,010
Ben.

365
00:25:33,030 --> 00:25:35,170
-Ben. So you wanna tell me
what you're doing

366
00:25:35,190 --> 00:25:36,950
in the middle of the jungle
all by yourself?

367
00:25:39,860 --> 00:25:41,950
I left home, and...

368
00:25:42,550 --> 00:25:43,950
i'm looking for my mom.

369
00:25:43,970 --> 00:25:45,140
You think she's out here?

370
00:25:46,390 --> 00:25:47,930
You wouldn't believe me.

371
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:49,600
Try me.

372
00:25:52,810 --> 00:25:53,690
She's dead.

373
00:25:59,380 --> 00:26:01,670
Did she die here... on the island?

374
00:26:01,810 --> 00:26:02,700
No.

375
00:26:04,510 --> 00:26:05,590
When i was a baby.

376
00:26:07,030 --> 00:26:08,110
Did you see her...

377
00:26:08,740 --> 00:26:10,310
out here,Ben, in the jungle?

378
00:26:12,930 --> 00:26:13,910
She talked to me.

379
00:26:17,190 --> 00:26:18,070
What did she say?

380
00:26:18,450 --> 00:26:19,580
That i couldn't come with her.

381
00:26:21,750 --> 00:26:23,020
She said it wasn't time yet.

382
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:32,820
You should go home now.

383
00:26:32,830 --> 00:26:34,140
Your people will be
looking for you.

384
00:26:34,150 --> 00:26:35,680
I don't wanna go back there!

385
00:26:37,420 --> 00:26:38,600
I hate it there!

386
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:45,600
Take me with you.

387
00:26:48,090 --> 00:26:49,430
Maybe that can happen...

388
00:26:50,260 --> 00:26:54,170
maybe,i mean,if that's what
you really want,Ben,

389
00:26:54,180 --> 00:26:55,040
if that's what you want.

390
00:26:55,050 --> 00:26:56,230
I want you to think about that...

391
00:26:59,110 --> 00:27:02,770
and you're gonna have to be very,
very patient.

392
00:27:25,110 --> 00:27:26,030
We're here.

393
00:27:40,020 --> 00:27:41,850
You'll want to turn off
your flashlight,John.

394
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:42,870
Why?

395
00:27:46,370 --> 00:27:48,890
Jacob feels the same way about
technology as you do.

396
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:29,430
Once i open this door,
there's no turning back.

397
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:34,920
Are you sure this is
what you want?

398
00:28:43,630 --> 00:28:44,700
So be it.

399
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:48,890
Jacob...

400
00:28:50,830 --> 00:28:52,140
i'm here with John Locke.

401
00:28:53,620 --> 00:28:54,530
We're coming in now.

402
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:19,270
Jacob...

403
00:29:21,900 --> 00:29:22,710
this is John.

404
00:29:26,050 --> 00:29:27,260
Aren't you going
to say hello,John?

405
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:31,260
What?

406
00:29:32,740 --> 00:29:33,950
I told you he wouldn't.

407
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,250
Who... what are you
talking about?

408
00:29:39,030 --> 00:29:40,170
You can't see him?

409
00:29:41,750 --> 00:29:42,760
See who?

410
00:29:42,770 --> 00:29:43,730
Jacob.

411
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:47,920
He's sitting right here in this chair.

412
00:29:48,710 --> 00:29:50,250
Yes,i know, but he insisted.

413
00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:54,010
What is this?

414
00:29:54,030 --> 00:29:55,560
You wanted the secrets
of the island?

415
00:29:57,230 --> 00:29:58,280
Well,here they are.

416
00:29:59,530 --> 00:30:01,880
This is the man who can
answer every single--

417
00:30:03,650 --> 00:30:07,210
i am not. 
He made me bring him here.

418
00:30:07,220 --> 00:30:08,140
Did you think that
that was my--

419
00:30:08,830 --> 00:30:10,850
-Sorry,may i finish?
-You're crazy.

420
00:30:13,740 --> 00:30:14,650
Excuse me?

421
00:30:16,350 --> 00:30:18,220
You don't know anything
about the island,do you?

422
00:30:18,230 --> 00:30:20,840
You just made it all up.

423
00:30:20,850 --> 00:30:22,260
Jacob,please, i can't hear him...
stop.

424
00:30:22,260 --> 00:30:24,480
-If you're gonna talk over
what he's saying--
stop. -Shut up!

425
00:30:27,210 --> 00:30:28,700
You're putting on a
show for me?

426
00:30:30,810 --> 00:30:31,690
Or do you...

427
00:30:34,410 --> 00:30:35,880
do you really think there's
someone there?

428
00:30:37,290 --> 00:30:38,990
<i>I know there's
someone there.</i>

429
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:45,390
You don't know anything.

430
00:30:54,860 --> 00:30:56,620
I'm sorry you feel
that way,John,

431
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:02,800
and i'm sorry that you're
too limited to see.

432
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:05,100
You're pathetic.

433
00:31:09,220 --> 00:31:11,220
<i>Help me.</i>

434
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,240
What did you just say?

435
00:31:22,780 --> 00:31:25,230
I... i didn't say anything.

436
00:31:25,990 --> 00:31:28,600
-Oh,yes,you did. I heard you.

437
00:31:29,370 --> 00:31:30,220
You said that--

438
00:31:50,820 --> 00:31:51,640
that's enough!

439
00:31:51,650 --> 00:31:52,800
You've had your fun!

440
00:32:42,890 --> 00:32:44,030
What was that?

441
00:32:49,750 --> 00:32:50,860
That was Jacob.

442
00:32:58,280 --> 00:32:59,420
What did you hear in there,John?

443
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:02,950
What did Jacob say to you?

444
00:33:05,310 --> 00:33:06,680
He didn't say anything to me.

445
00:33:07,220 --> 00:33:08,100
<i>You did.</i>

446
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:10,520
What are you talking about?

447
00:33:10,540 --> 00:33:13,600
There is no Jacob,ben.
I'm not gonna be taken in

448
00:33:13,620 --> 00:33:16,980
by the little...
show you put on last night.

449
00:33:16,990 --> 00:33:18,200
You're a fraud,

450
00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:21,220
and it's time your people
were told the truth.

451
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:24,430
And this is not
the way we came.

452
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:28,070
I'm taking us back
another way.

453
00:33:28,770 --> 00:33:30,500
I wanted to show you
something first.

454
00:33:31,330 --> 00:33:32,370
I've seen enough.

455
00:33:34,140 --> 00:33:35,390
You know,John,
you're not wrong.

456
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:37,220
Some of the things i've told you--

457
00:33:37,730 --> 00:33:39,290
some of the things i've
told everybody--

458
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:41,260
are simply not true.

459
00:33:41,930 --> 00:33:42,710
Like what?

460
00:33:43,670 --> 00:33:44,720
Well,for starters,

461
00:33:45,150 --> 00:33:46,720
i wasn't born
on this island.

462
00:33:48,530 --> 00:33:49,800
Then where did
you come from?

463
00:33:53,170 --> 00:33:54,220
That's what i want
to show you.

464
00:34:46,220 --> 00:34:46,940
Morning.

465
00:34:47,380 --> 00:34:48,320
Okay,wait.

466
00:34:48,820 --> 00:34:50,550
Put it right...
right down there.

467
00:34:54,160 --> 00:34:55,460
What's the problem now?

468
00:34:56,450 --> 00:34:58,670
You're usually chatty
Cathy in the morning.

469
00:34:59,430 --> 00:35:00,370
It's my birthday.

470
00:35:04,690 --> 00:35:06,550
I don't know why i keep fooling
myself into thinking

471
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:09,370
that one of these years you're
actually gonna remember.

472
00:35:13,090 --> 00:35:14,050
Well,i tell you what.

473
00:35:15,070 --> 00:35:16,180
All we gotta do this morning

474
00:35:16,190 --> 00:35:18,960
is run this stuff
outo Pearl Station.

475
00:35:20,700 --> 00:35:22,240
Why don't we go up
to the Mesa,

476
00:35:22,970 --> 00:35:24,240
drink some beers?

477
00:35:27,550 --> 00:35:28,530
Have some...

478
00:35:29,940 --> 00:35:30,830
i don't know...

479
00:35:30,850 --> 00:35:32,250
Father and son time?

480
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:36,820
I'd like that.

481
00:35:37,810 --> 00:35:38,660
Okay.

482
00:35:54,260 --> 00:35:55,010
Well...

483
00:35:57,270 --> 00:35:59,040
you sure can't say
it ain't beautiful.

484
00:36:12,870 --> 00:36:14,340
Do you really blame me?

485
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:16,140
What?

486
00:36:17,790 --> 00:36:20,530
Do you really think it's
my fault that she died?

487
00:36:25,430 --> 00:36:26,410
What do i know?

488
00:36:31,970 --> 00:36:33,600
Why do you keep looking
at your watch?

489
00:36:34,390 --> 00:36:35,240
You got a date?

490
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:37,670
Listen...

491
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,600
if it makes you
feel any better,

492
00:36:43,670 --> 00:36:45,170
i will do my best

493
00:36:45,180 --> 00:36:47,040
to remember your
birthday next year.

494
00:36:51,390 --> 00:36:52,930
I don't think that's
gonna happen,dad.

495
00:36:55,980 --> 00:36:56,830
What do you mean?

496
00:36:57,810 --> 00:36:59,250
You know, i've missed her,too,

497
00:37:00,270 --> 00:37:01,870
maybe as much as you have.

498
00:37:02,530 --> 00:37:03,740
But the difference is

499
00:37:04,270 --> 00:37:06,330
that for as long as
i can remember,

500
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:08,670
i've had to put up with you.

501
00:37:11,230 --> 00:37:12,270
And doing at

502
00:37:12,940 --> 00:37:16,430
required a tremendous
amount of patience.

503
00:37:23,790 --> 00:37:24,740
Good-bye,dad.

504
00:37:34,690 --> 00:37:35,510
Ben...

505
00:39:48,650 --> 00:39:51,350
you want us to,uh,
go get his body?

506
00:39:55,930 --> 00:39:57,080
No,leave him out there.

507
00:39:59,420 --> 00:40:00,310
Okay.

508
00:40:21,020 --> 00:40:22,660
This is where i came from,John.

509
00:40:26,610 --> 00:40:28,150
These are my people...

510
00:40:29,660 --> 00:40:31,230
the Dharma Initiative.

511
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:36,240
<i>They came here
seeking harmony...</i>

512
00:40:39,250 --> 00:40:40,720
but they couldn't
even co-exist

513
00:40:40,740 --> 00:40:42,780
with the island's
original inhabitants.

514
00:40:46,260 --> 00:40:49,200
And when it became clear
that one side had to go,

515
00:40:50,130 --> 00:40:52,250
<i>one side had to be purged...</i>

516
00:40:55,070 --> 00:40:56,340
i did what i had to do.

517
00:40:58,710 --> 00:41:00,430
I was one of the people
that was smart enough

518
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:03,220
<i>to make sure that i didn't
end up in that ditch...</i>

519
00:41:04,180 --> 00:41:06,590
<i>which makes me considerably
smarter than you,John.</i>

520
00:41:08,930 --> 00:41:09,870
Uhh!

521
00:41:21,910 --> 00:41:23,220
What did Jacob say to you?

522
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:25,350
Why did you do this?

523
00:41:26,140 --> 00:41:27,870
<i>Because you heard him.</i>

524
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:32,390
Now i need to know what he said.

525
00:41:33,250 --> 00:41:34,260
"Help me."

526
00:41:34,540 --> 00:41:35,390
John...

527
00:41:36,910 --> 00:41:38,370
I'm not gonna ask you again.

528
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:41,120
What did he say to you?

529
