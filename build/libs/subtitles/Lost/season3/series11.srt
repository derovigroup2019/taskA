previously on "lost"...

2
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:05,400
hugo, you cango back to your camp.

3
00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:06,700
What about my friends?

4
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:09,220
Your job is to tellthe rest of your people

5
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:11,320
they can never come here.

6
00:00:11,390 --> 00:00:14,200
Rest in peace, mr.Eko.

7
00:00:16,070 --> 00:00:18,970
And thank youfor helping me find my...

8
00:00:19,130 --> 00:00:22,420
lift up your eyes and look north,john

9
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:25,730
I don't care what jack said.

10
00:00:25,770 --> 00:00:27,170
They've got him, and we haveto get him back.

11
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:28,710
I owe him that.

12
00:00:28,730 --> 00:00:31,740
The pearl is a monitoring station

13
00:00:31,850 --> 00:00:35,650
where the activities of participants in the dharma initiative projects

14
00:00:35,690 --> 00:00:38,270
can be observed and recorded.

15
00:00:44,770 --> 00:00:46,950
I guesshe'll be expecting us.

16
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:05,160
Ping-pong table?

17
00:01:05,210 --> 00:01:06,920
Where the helldid that come from?

18
00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:09,760
Jin found it when he was outlooking for firewood.

19
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:12,580
We made legs for itand paddles.

20
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:14,280
Now all we needis a ball.

21
00:01:14,330 --> 00:01:15,930
Found it?

22
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:18,940
Must have landed in the junglewhen the hatch exploded.

23
00:01:18,980 --> 00:01:20,370
I thoughtthe hatch collapsed.

24
00:01:20,410 --> 00:01:22,390
Look, dude, all I knowis the sky turned purple.

25
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:26,820
After that,I don't ask questions, just make myself a saladand move on.

26
00:01:26,830 --> 00:01:29,050
Yeah, I can seethat's working for you.

27
00:01:29,110 --> 00:01:31,990
Hey, you seen kate around?

28
00:01:32,030 --> 00:01:34,090
Wow, she's not back yet?

29
00:01:36,710 --> 00:01:38,960
Hmm.You guys find anythingwe can use for a ball?

30
00:01:39,010 --> 00:01:40,540
no.

31
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:43,850
Hey,that's my "guns & ammo.

32
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:45,120
" Where the helldid you get it?

33
00:01:45,170 --> 00:01:47,310
It was in the magazine stack.

34
00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:49,360
We share things now.

35
00:01:49,730 --> 00:01:52,770
Listen, zorro,it was in my stuff--

36
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:54,430
stuff you all decided to haveyourselves a little party

37
00:01:54,460 --> 00:01:55,930
with while you thoughtI was dead.

38
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:59,470
Listen, hillbilly, if youwant it that bad, take it.

39
00:02:02,470 --> 00:02:04,280
Just keep it.

40
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,220
we need to eat.

41
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:27,770
Are we still on course?

42
00:02:33,890 --> 00:02:37,060
We're still heading northon a bearing of 3-0-5.

43
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:38,600
Yes.

44
00:02:38,610 --> 00:02:40,270
I'm sensinga lack of confidence.

45
00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:41,950
We've been walking for two days,

46
00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:45,700
following a compass bearing provided bythe carvings on a stick.

47
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:46,540
And?

48
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:49,470
You really think we're just going to chanceupon where the others are?

49
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:51,550
I don't know whatwe're gonna chance on, sayid,

50
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:55,210
but my bearingis the only bearing we got.

51
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:01,510
I'm goingto find some fruit, and then,

52
00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:05,380
john, we're goingto have a rational conversation regarding our next move.

56
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:44,950
Y'all looking for something like...this?

57
00:04:44,970 --> 00:04:46,600
Cool, a ball.

58
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:50,480
We need to do a little quid pro quo first.

59
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:51,800
I know I've been gone a while,

60
00:04:51,830 --> 00:04:53,090
and y'all thought the general store

61
00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:55,550
was having a going out of business sale,

62
00:04:55,580 --> 00:04:58,290
but now I'm back, and I want whas mine.

63
00:04:58,330 --> 00:05:00,970
Yeah, but it wasn't really yours to begin with.

64
00:05:01,010 --> 00:05:03,030
"A"-- it was mine when I took it.

65
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:05,720
"B"--who the hell are you?

66
00:05:05,910 --> 00:05:10,810
And "c"--because I'm fair, I'm gonna let you play me for it.

67
00:05:11,570 --> 00:05:13,360
Play ping-pong?

68
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:15,430
That's right, avalanche.

69
00:05:15,470 --> 00:05:17,210
You bastards put up your best player.

70
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:20,560
One game, and when I crush them,

71
00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:24,020
y'all gotta bring me every piece of my stash back.

72
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:25,900
And if you lose?

73
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:29,690
I ain't gonna lose, but...

74
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:35,330
if I do, tell you what-- name it.

75
00:05:42,770 --> 00:05:48,320
ooh, looks like crouching tiger and hidden dragon got something good.

76
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,220
Lay it on me.

77
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,240
No nicknames.

78
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:57,260
If y lose, no nicknames for anyone...

79
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:59,450
for a week.

80
00:05:59,710 --> 00:06:01,760
Nice.

81
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:05,550
You're on.

82
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:08,130
Pick your player.

83
00:06:08,140 --> 00:06:11,900
I'll be back in an hour, then let the slaughter begin.

84
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:19,570
are you sure it's completely isolated?

85
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,610
I've circled the house.

86
00:06:22,630 --> 00:06:24,990
There's nothing but jungle surrounding it.

87
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:26,640
Here.

88
00:06:29,590 --> 00:06:31,260
That dish still work?

89
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:32,690
A satellite dish of that size would have

90
00:06:32,710 --> 00:06:36,620
broadcasting capabilities for thousands of miles.

91
00:06:37,050 --> 00:06:40,410
Danielle, you once mentioned a radio tower.

92
00:06:40,570 --> 00:06:42,060
Is this it?

93
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:43,670
I have never been here before.

94
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:48,010
The man in the house--you said you've seen him before?

95
00:06:48,030 --> 00:06:50,740
On a video feed from the pearl station.

96
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,100
So who is he?

97
00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:54,810
Only one way to find out...

98
00:06:57,210 --> 00:06:59,260
we ask him.

99
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:00,390
What's this for?

100
00:07:00,410 --> 00:07:03,910
If I'm unarmed, he won't feel threatened.

101
00:07:04,010 --> 00:07:07,150
In case he is threatened, you can cover me from here.

102
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:10,060
Hey, where are you going?

103
00:07:10,090 --> 00:07:13,330
I have no interest in that man inside the house.

104
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:18,760
I have survived on the island precisely by avoiding these types of encounters.

105
00:07:20,130 --> 00:07:22,640
I'll wait for you by the stream...

106
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:25,010
for those of you who survive.

107
00:07:48,370 --> 00:07:51,670
najeev.Najeev.

108
00:07:52,050 --> 00:07:54,480
A man******see you.

109
00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:08,010
did you cook this?

110
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:09,700
Yes, I did.

111
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:12,890
Well, it's delicious.

112
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,740
My name is sami.

113
00:08:15,810 --> 00:08:17,800
Najeev.Thank you.

114
00:08:17,850 --> 00:08:21,080
Please sit.Sit.

115
00:08:22,670 --> 00:08:24,290
So where are you from, najeev?

116
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:26,010
I'm syrian.

117
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:27,180
Please.

118
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:31,920
You****man.

119
00:08:37,770 --> 00:08:39,690
what do you want from me?

120
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:43,890
You're an excellent cook, and I...

121
00:08:43,910 --> 00:08:47,690
I have a restaurant much nicer than this place.

122
00:08:47,710 --> 00:08:49,780
Come take a look.

123
00:08:49,810 --> 00:08:55,070
If you like it, I will hire you at twice your pay here.

124
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:58,270
You're offering a stranger a job because of a single meal?

125
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:02,810
I'm offering you a jobbecause we are outsiders here,

126
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:07,110
and because, uh,my chef just quit.

127
00:09:49,370 --> 00:09:51,020
he's bn hit,he's been hit.

128
00:09:51,050 --> 00:09:51,670
Not yet.

129
00:09:51,690 --> 00:09:52,430
You wanna get shot, too?

130
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:54,040
I didn't cross the line!

131
00:09:54,070 --> 00:09:55,350
We had a truce.

132
00:09:55,390 --> 00:09:56,070
This is my land!

133
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:57,810
I'm not-- you said I could stay here!

134
00:09:57,850 --> 00:10:00,560
I'm not who you--who you think I am.

135
00:10:00,590 --> 00:10:02,780
My name is sayid jarrah.

136
00:10:02,830 --> 00:10:06,110
I was on a planethat crashed here months ago.

137
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,030
A plane?!

138
00:10:09,110 --> 00:10:12,090
I'm unarmed, I swear!

139
00:10:14,330 --> 00:10:16,610
Stay right the!

140
00:10:28,180 --> 00:10:29,320
drop the rifle!

141
00:10:29,330 --> 00:10:31,140
Drop it right now.

142
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:32,700
Back up.

143
00:10:32,730 --> 00:10:34,920
Back up.

144
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:41,790
Are you all right?

145
00:10:41,830 --> 00:10:43,690
You really did crash here?

146
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:46,370
Over 40 of us, yes.

147
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:49,540
I'll go in first,make sure it's okay.

148
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:52,770
Who are you?

149
00:10:52,850 --> 00:10:55,600
My nameis mikhail bakunin...

150
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:59,870
and I am the last living memberof the dharma initiative.

151
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:07,660
watch your step.

152
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:15,230
please...sit.

153
00:11:16,430 --> 00:11:18,390
here, let me.

154
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:23,050
You've had experiencetreating gunshot wounds?

155
00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:25,540
I spent some timein afghanistan.

156
00:11:25,950 --> 00:11:28,500
I had experiencewith field medicine...

157
00:11:28,550 --> 00:11:30,800
in the soviet army.

158
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:34,780
In the kitchen on the top shelfthere is a medical kit.

159
00:11:34,810 --> 00:11:37,080
Will you bring it, please?

160
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:40,240
It's all right, kate.

161
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:50,180
How did you get here?

162
00:11:50,230 --> 00:11:52,620
I almost don't knowwhere to begin.

163
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:56,010
Why don't you beginwith the dharma initiative?

164
00:11:56,060 --> 00:11:59,760
I grew up in kievand joined the soviet army.

165
00:11:59,850 --> 00:12:03,440
I was stationed ata listening post in vladivostok.

166
00:12:05,610 --> 00:12:09,960
After the cold war, after we lost the cold war,

167
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,220
my unit was decommissioned.

168
00:12:12,810 --> 00:12:15,760
I was dismissedfrom my life in the military,

169
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:21,680
and after years of conductingunpleasant actions against our enemies,

170
00:12:21,790 --> 00:12:24,880
I found myselfwanting to do something good,

171
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:28,080
so I replied toa newspaper advertisement.

172
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:29,530
An advertisement?

173
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:32,470
"Would you liketoave the world?" It read.

174
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:35,280
That's how I metthe initiative.

175
00:12:35,310 --> 00:12:40,570
They're very secretive,very rich and very smart.

176
00:12:40,850 --> 00:12:42,930
So when did youcome to the island?

177
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:44,530
11 years now.

178
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:48,900
I liked computers,communications equipment

179
00:12:48,950 --> 00:12:51,620
and being alonelike a lighthouse keeper,

180
00:12:52,330 --> 00:12:54,540
so they put mein this station.

181
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:56,680
They called it"the flame.

182
00:12:56,710 --> 00:12:58,990
" What's the purposeof the flame?

183
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:02,830
To communicate withthe outside world, of course.

184
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:09,590
ready to play?

185
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,690
Ready to play?

186
00:13:26,890 --> 00:13:29,270
Your move.

187
00:13:33,230 --> 00:13:36,110
What happenedto the dharma initiative?

188
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:38,170
They're all dead,of course.

189
00:13:38,190 --> 00:13:41,760
They foolishly initiateda war against the hostiles--

190
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:44,400
a "purge," they called it.

191
00:13:45,070 --> 00:13:47,920
And how did yousurvive this purge?

192
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:51,300
By not participating in it.

193
00:13:51,690 --> 00:13:52,870
I told you.

194
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:54,680
I like being alone.

195
00:13:54,710 --> 00:13:58,150
And the hostilesallowed you to stay here?

196
00:13:58,390 --> 00:14:02,340
After it was over, four men appearedin the yard.

197
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:04,910
They offered a truce.

198
00:14:04,990 --> 00:14:08,590
They saidto imagine a line that extended all the wayaround the valley.

199
00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:12,850
As long as I did notcross it, I would be left alone.

200
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:18,610
Then they took two cows, and I never saw them again.

201
00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:21,030
They weren't interested inthe satellite dish in the yard?

202
00:14:21,050 --> 00:14:22,500
Why would they be?

203
00:14:22,510 --> 00:14:25,120
It hasn't functioned for years.

204
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:27,780
Who are they--these hostiles?

205
00:14:27,790 --> 00:14:33,180
I do not know, but they were here fora long time before we were--

206
00:14:33,810 --> 00:14:35,920
a very long time.

207
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:02,350
I'm looking for sami.

208
00:15:02,890 --> 00:15:04,600
Sami!

209
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:10,250
Najeev,I'm so glad you came.

210
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:11,860
What do you think?

211
00:15:11,890 --> 00:15:17,070
It's a simple place,as you can see, but we have good customers.

212
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:19,450
Ah, here's my wife.

213
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:22,140
She's in chargeof the kitchen.

214
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:26,920
Amira, come meet najeev.

215
00:15:34,370 --> 00:15:36,350
Pleasure to meet you.

216
00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:41,320
Are you sure this is him?

217
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:43,680
Yes.

218
00:15:44,090 --> 00:15:46,280
Look, I don't knowwho you think I am--

219
00:16:19,950 --> 00:16:21,660
what did you just say?

220
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:24,840
I told nadia to be polite,because you are my guests.

221
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:25,440
Nadia?

222
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:31,620
Mm, after nadia comaneci, the greatest athletethe world has ever known.

223
00:16:32,580 --> 00:16:34,920
We havethe same birthday.

224
00:16:36,110 --> 00:16:40,190
what?What?

225
00:16:42,130 --> 00:16:43,540
now...

226
00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:46,490
excellent work,if I say myself.

227
00:16:46,510 --> 00:16:48,290
Thank you, mikhail.

228
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:52,570
Perhaps I can beginto earn your forgiveness by offeringsome iced tea.

229
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:55,060
I will also checkon your friend.

230
00:17:10,650 --> 00:17:12,070
don't waste your time.

231
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:14,340
For ten years I've triedto defeat that game.

232
00:17:14,390 --> 00:17:17,050
But it was programmed by three grand masters...

233
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:18,970
And it cheats.

234
00:17:20,070 --> 00:17:22,390
Hmm.Wel I've playeda lot of computers,

235
00:17:22,430 --> 00:17:25,180
and I'm pretty surethey don't know how to cheat.

236
00:17:25,620 --> 00:17:29,070
That's what makesbeing human so distinctly...

237
00:17:30,210 --> 00:17:31,800
wonderful.

238
00:17:43,030 --> 00:17:44,560
what's wrong?

239
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:47,850
it just...it doesn't make any sense.

240
00:17:48,290 --> 00:17:50,470
Why would theylet him stay here,

241
00:17:50,490 --> 00:17:52,980
with all this stuff,all this equipment?

242
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,160
Actually,it makes perfect sense.

243
00:17:55,170 --> 00:17:56,480
What are youtalking about?

244
00:17:56,500 --> 00:18:00,630
The reasonthey let him stay here is becausehe is not dharma.

245
00:18:02,630 --> 00:18:04,360
He is one of them.

246
00:18:09,340 --> 00:18:11,740
He shot you,and you just let him...

247
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:15,670
why are we stillsitting here?

248
00:18:15,770 --> 00:18:17,020
We are sitting here, kate,

249
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:20,040
because I am certainhe is not alone.

250
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:38,160
So...you really the number onedraft pick, grimace?

251
00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:42,800
Yep.Are we playingwith the mercy rule?

252
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:44,130
Mercy rule?

253
00:18:44,140 --> 00:18:50,430
Yeah, like,if I'm up 11-0, then I, you know,automatically win.

254
00:18:50,850 --> 00:18:52,640
You're gonna go up 11-0?

255
00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:55,130
No, I meaneither one of us.

256
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:57,830
Sure.

257
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:59,970
We can havea mercy rule.

258
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:02,050
Do you wanna volleyfor serve?

259
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:05,570
I'll tell you what--be my guest.

260
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:07,470
Take him down, hurley.

261
00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:11,270
come on, hurley.

262
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:13,270
0 serving 0.

263
00:19:15,340 --> 00:19:17,690
Yeah!Whoo!

264
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:24,120
1-nothing.

265
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:35,700
I grow the tea myself, so pardon its bitterness.

266
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:37,170
Any tea is good tea.

267
00:19:37,190 --> 00:19:39,800
You know how long it's beensince we've seen ice?

268
00:19:41,540 --> 00:19:45,690
I noticed a seriesof thick wires as I walkedaround the station.

269
00:19:45,710 --> 00:19:47,840
This is the hub,but they go underground to

270
00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:50,180
various stationsall over the island.

271
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:52,790
And these cables--do anyof them run into the ocean?

272
00:19:52,790 --> 00:19:56,700
Yes.There isan underwater beacon that emits sonar pingsto

273
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:58,340
help guide in the vessels.

274
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:00,030
By vessels,you mean submarines?

275
00:20:00,050 --> 00:20:01,730
Yes.

276
00:20:01,790 --> 00:20:04,580
The initiativeused one to bring us here,

277
00:20:04,610 --> 00:20:06,900
but I can imagine onlythat the hostiles have

278
00:20:06,930 --> 00:20:09,550
either destroyedor commandeered it by now.

279
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:10,920
That explains howthey were able to

280
00:20:10,950 --> 00:20:13,990
get round my positionand capture our sailboat.

281
00:20:14,010 --> 00:20:16,030
You have a sailboat?

282
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:19,460
Till we lost itto your hostiles.

283
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:22,500
That's very unfortunate.

284
00:20:23,690 --> 00:20:25,720
Well...

285
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:29,090
at least we were aeto kill one them.

286
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:39,320
Why are we continuingto play this little game...

287
00:20:41,210 --> 00:20:44,510
when we all knowit has moved to the next stage?

288
00:21:14,110 --> 00:21:15,990
Get some rope.

289
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:40,120
drink.

290
00:21:53,550 --> 00:21:58,380
you were a torturer,were you not, in the republican guard?

291
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:04,590
Do you not recognizeone of your victims?

292
00:22:04,650 --> 00:22:08,200
Do you not recognizethe woman that you tortured?

293
00:22:08,210 --> 00:22:10,310
Do youot recognizemy wife?!

294
00:22:10,330 --> 00:22:12,300
No, I've never...

295
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:17,970
you've confused mewith someone else.

296
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:28,210
Amira was arrested for harboringan enemy of the state.

297
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:34,390
She was heldfor three months while she was questioned.

298
00:22:37,540 --> 00:22:41,780
Her arms bear the scars of those questions.

299
00:22:42,340 --> 00:22:47,200
So I assure you, najeev,I am not confus.

300
00:22:51,210 --> 00:22:53,290
My name is not najeev.

301
00:22:54,490 --> 00:22:56,680
I am sayid jarrah.

302
00:22:57,650 --> 00:23:00,300
I wasin the republican guard, and, yes,

303
00:23:00,310 --> 00:23:03,840
I was an interrogator,but I have never seen your wife.

304
00:23:03,860 --> 00:23:05,570
Maybe she saw meat the same facility,

305
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:08,240
but I do not know her!

306
00:23:08,730 --> 00:23:12,810
I can remember every face of every personI've interrogated.

307
00:23:12,820 --> 00:23:15,330
She remembers your face.

308
00:23:18,250 --> 00:23:22,470
She remembers it so well that she recognized it

309
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:27,900
from a mere glimpse when we walked by the restaurantwhere you worked!

310
00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:40,560
What do you want from me?

311
00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:46,490
I want you to admitto what you did, and if you don't,

312
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:50,320
you will leave this roomin that bag.

313
00:24:01,260 --> 00:24:03,260
How do you knowhe isn't alone?

314
00:24:03,260 --> 00:24:05,430
The horse outsideis still saddled,

315
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:08,870
and the stirrupsare set up for someone much shorterthan thiman.

316
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:12,030
You think the others sentsomeone to keep him company?

317
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:15,910
They sent someone out here because they lostcommunications.

318
00:24:15,940 --> 00:24:18,310
Maybe whenthe sky turned purple?

319
00:24:18,330 --> 00:24:20,140
That would be my guess.

320
00:24:20,150 --> 00:24:22,420
Well,if there's someone else here, they're hiding pretty good.

321
00:24:22,450 --> 00:24:25,950
I checked every nook and crannyof this place...

322
00:24:29,860 --> 00:24:32,380
not everynook and cranny, john.

323
00:25:00,660 --> 00:25:03,050
are you readyto tell me the truth?

324
00:25:03,050 --> 00:25:05,620
I have told you the truth.

325
00:25:09,550 --> 00:25:11,710
I do not know you--uhh!

326
00:25:12,470 --> 00:25:14,280
You tortured her.

327
00:25:16,470 --> 00:25:17,620
no.

328
00:25:17,660 --> 00:25:20,340
I would nevertouch a woman--uhh!

329
00:25:26,650 --> 00:25:28,910
do you tnkthis will do any good,

330
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:32,600
that this will make me confessto something I didn't do?

331
00:25:32,650 --> 00:25:35,700
My wife confessedto something she didn't do.

332
00:25:35,730 --> 00:25:39,740
She confessed when you poured a panof boiling oil over her arms.

333
00:25:39,790 --> 00:25:41,430
No, I did not.You have the wrong--

334
00:25:41,450 --> 00:25:46,110
admit it!admit it!

335
00:25:46,330 --> 00:25:49,620
I cannot admitto something I didn't do.

336
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:01,670
that is enough for today.

337
00:26:09,390 --> 00:26:11,700
Then I willsee you tomorrow.

338
00:26:45,300 --> 00:26:47,080
your move.

339
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:59,170
Your move.

340
00:27:09,950 --> 00:27:11,120
what is it?

341
00:27:11,140 --> 00:27:13,070
C-4...

342
00:27:13,150 --> 00:27:15,150
explosive.

343
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:20,480
The whole place is wired.

344
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:22,240
Why?

345
00:27:22,330 --> 00:27:24,160
I don't know.

346
00:27:27,420 --> 00:27:29,030
Your move.

347
00:27:37,370 --> 00:27:38,810
Your move.

348
00:28:32,820 --> 00:28:34,650
your move.

349
00:28:46,910 --> 00:28:48,490

00:30:22,070 --> 00:30:25,480
Put the gunon the ground...now.

363
00:30:37,630 --> 00:30:38,950
what are you doing?

364
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,550
It's her.

365
00:30:40,850 --> 00:30:42,150
She was there!

366
00:30:42,190 --> 00:30:43,240
She was at the dock.

367
00:30:43,290 --> 00:30:45,410
She wasthere when we were kidnapped.

368
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:47,670
She knows where jack is.

369
00:30:53,050 --> 00:30:55,180
Are there any moreof you here?

370
00:31:03,210 --> 00:31:05,950
Let's take her upstairs.Come on.

371
00:31:05,980 --> 00:31:08,440
John, we're coming up!

372
00:31:11,420 --> 00:31:12,660
john!

373
00:31:12,670 --> 00:31:14,360
out here.

374
00:31:16,790 --> 00:31:18,440
Move.

375
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:27,320
This is simple.

376
00:31:27,340 --> 00:31:29,560
Send her over to me,d I will release him.

377
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:30,890
Then we all go our separate ways.

378
00:31:30,930 --> 00:31:32,160
Don't listen to him.

379
00:31:32,460 --> 00:31:34,400
If he was gonna kill me,I'd be dead already.

380
00:31:34,450 --> 00:31:35,130
Shut your mouth.

381
00:31:35,170 --> 00:31:37,320
- Listen to me.
- Sayid, do not let her go.

382
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:38,580
I will execute you right here.

383
00:31:38,620 --> 00:31:39,980
- He's not gonna do it.
- Be quiet, john.

384
00:31:40,010 --> 00:31:41,190
I'm the only thing keeping him alive.

385
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:41,770
I swear to you-- mikhail.

386
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:43,130
Calm down, everyone.

387
00:31:43,150 --> 00:31:47,060
- Mikhail!- sayid.

388
00:31:47,110 --> 00:31:48,150
I'll handle thisjohn.

389
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:48,980
John...

390
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:56,010
don't let her talk to him!

391
00:31:58,760 --> 00:32:00,990
stop!- Just do it, mikhail!

392
00:32:05,730 --> 00:32:07,000
John!

393
00:32:12,950 --> 00:32:14,640
Finish it!

394
00:32:17,780 --> 00:32:19,510
Kill me.

395
00:32:36,380 --> 00:32:38,440
Sorry I beat youso bad, dude.

396
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:40,840
Sorry you hustled me,you mean.

397
00:32:41,390 --> 00:32:43,680
My mom had a tablein her basement, 

398
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:46,110
and I played a lotat the insti-- 

399
00:32:46,130 --> 00:32:49,610
this placeI hung out for a while.

400
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:52,520
I got kinda good.

401
00:32:52,550 --> 00:32:54,360
Well, hooray for you.

402
00:32:54,980 --> 00:32:56,840
Doesn't look likeat last slam caused 

403
00:32:56,850 --> 00:32:59,890
any long-term damageto your forehead...

404
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:02,190
d you got 3 points,which is better than zero.

405
00:33:02,220 --> 00:33:04,000
Something you want?

406
00:33:04,030 --> 00:33:06,340
Came to give you backsome of your stuff, 

407
00:33:06,950 --> 00:33:10,800
'cause, uh, you know, you're the kind of guythat needs stuff.

408
00:33:10,850 --> 00:33:12,930
You a shrink now?

409
00:33:13,820 --> 00:33:17,760
She'll be okay, dude-- kate.

410
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:21,280
I know you're worriedabout her, but she's with locke and sayid.

411
00:33:21,310 --> 00:33:22,970
She's gonna be fine.

412
00:33:23,020 --> 00:33:26,690
Yeah, well, thanksfor the pep talk, lump-- unh-unh, dude.

413
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:31,270
It's hurley...or hugo, if you want.

414
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:36,870
get bent, hugo.

415
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:45,700
you ready to go, locke?

416
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:48,150
I'll be there in a minute.

417
00:33:50,140 --> 00:33:53,760
Has there been an incursion on this station by the hostiles?

418
00:33:53,820 --> 00:33:58,300
If so, enter 7-7.

419
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:05,260
danielle!Danielle!

420
00:34:08,510 --> 00:34:10,380
Tell me something.

421
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:13,570
Were you ever a memberof the dharma initiative, 

422
00:34:14,020 --> 00:34:16,250
or was everythingyou said a lie?

423
00:34:17,010 --> 00:34:19,490
Of courseI'm wasting my breath.

424
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:23,660
I was never a member, but everything elseI told you was true.

425
00:34:23,710 --> 00:34:25,700
I moved into the station after the purge.

426
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:28,740
The purge, in which a group of scientistsattacked your people?

427
00:34:28,770 --> 00:34:31,320
Believe what you want,but that is what happened.

428
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,330
Your friends--did he kill them?

429
00:34:35,370 --> 00:34:36,360
No.

430
00:34:36,380 --> 00:34:39,040
They're collecting whatever may be usefulfrom the farmhouse, 

431
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:41,860
and now we have our ticketto where the others live, 

432
00:34:41,910 --> 00:34:45,420
where we'll findyour daughter and jack, and finally, 

433
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:48,210
perhaps,a way home.

434
00:34:48,640 --> 00:34:53,020
There is nothingyou could do to me that would make melead you there.

435
00:34:55,090 --> 00:34:58,550
I didn't say you were our ticket, did I?

436
00:35:06,100 --> 00:35:08,980
This is a map showingelectrical and data cabling 

437
00:35:09,650 --> 00:35:12,010
running from the flame, here, 

438
00:35:12,390 --> 00:35:15,550
to a place called"the barracks," here.

439
00:35:15,770 --> 00:35:19,500
It's comprised of housesand dormitories with water and power, 

440
00:35:19,550 --> 00:35:22,770
large enough to accommodatean entire community.

441
00:35:24,030 --> 00:35:27,840
Sounds like a place well worthvisiting, don't you think?

442
00:35:28,380 --> 00:35:31,140
There will come a timewhen your guard is down, 

443
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:36,520
and when it is, I will not hesitate a momentbefore killing you.

444
00:35:38,910 --> 00:35:42,200
- You shouldknow this before- - he's makingan excellent point.

445
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:44,350
You have a map.

446
00:35:44,410 --> 00:35:46,480
Why keep him alive?

447
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:17,100
after my husband and ifirst arrived to paris, 

448
00:36:18,390 --> 00:36:21,270
I was afraidto ever leave our apartment.

449
00:36:23,770 --> 00:36:27,200
So I would stareout the window into the alley, 

450
00:36:27,810 --> 00:36:31,070
and I would see this catlooking for scraps.

451
00:36:31,740 --> 00:36:37,140
One day, some childrencame into the alley and trapped him in a box.

452
00:36:37,750 --> 00:36:44,450
I watched themlight firecrackers and drop them in the box.

453
00:36:46,150 --> 00:36:49,680
I could hear him howlfrom three stories above.

454
00:36:52,490 --> 00:36:57,340
So finally, I had a reasonto leave my apartment.

455
00:36:59,170 --> 00:37:02,910
I rescued this cat, and I brought him home.

456
00:37:04,020 --> 00:37:06,470
He sits with mewhen I read.

457
00:37:07,710 --> 00:37:14,110
He sleeps with me, and he purrs.

458
00:37:17,580 --> 00:37:21,410
but...every once in a while, 

459
00:37:21,690 --> 00:37:25,230
he will bite meor scratch me.

460
00:37:28,950 --> 00:37:36,520
He does this because sometimes he forgetsthat he is safe now.

461
00:37:37,310 --> 00:37:41,490
So I forve himwhen he bites me, 

462
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:48,410
because I knowwhat it is like to never feel safe.

463
00:37:51,750 --> 00:37:54,170
And that isbecause of you.

464
00:37:58,420 --> 00:38:03,450
So today...I ask only one thingof you.

465
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:11,120
I ask you now that you show methe respect of 

466
00:38:11,150 --> 00:38:14,460
acknowledgingwhat you did to me...

467
00:38:15,940 --> 00:38:22,000
that it was youwho questioned me, that tortured me...

468
00:38:23,620 --> 00:38:26,360
and that you remember me.

469
00:38:41,650 --> 00:38:43,690
I remember you.

470
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:50,340
I remember your face.

471
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:56,640
Your face has haunted meever since I left iraq.

472
00:39:13,270 --> 00:39:15,270
I am sorry.

473
00:39:17,220 --> 00:39:20,730
I am so sorryfor what I did to you.

474
00:39:32,860 --> 00:39:35,130
I forgive you.

475
00:39:40,050 --> 00:39:47,070
When my husband returns, I will tell himI made a terrible mistake, 

476
00:39:48,490 --> 00:39:50,760
that it was not you...

477
00:39:53,260 --> 00:39:55,830
and he will release you.

478
00:39:56,730 --> 00:39:58,820
Why?

479
00:39:59,530 --> 00:40:02,300
Why are youletting me go?

480
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:07,990
We are allcapable of doing what those children didto this cat...

481
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:12,780
but I will not dthat.

482
00:40:12,870 --> 00:40:15,310
I will not be that.

483
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:29,670
We should kill him, sayid.

484
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:32,190
He already told usthat he would kill us.

485
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:40,520
No.

486
00:40:41,300 --> 00:40:43,420
He's my prisoner.

487
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:45,700
I will decide his fate.

488
00:40:51,350 --> 00:40:54,110
I can see you didn'tfind anything worth taking.

489
00:40:54,260 --> 00:40:57,030
Actually, I just playedthat silly chess game again, 

490
00:40:57,050 --> 00:41:00,550
and now I realize whyyou didn't want me to beat it.

491
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:05,250
Meaning what?

492
00:41:14,380 --> 00:41:16,370
What have you done, john?

493
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:20,210
That place was our one hope of communicationwith the outside world!

494
00:41:20,250 --> 00:41:23,360
The computer saidif there was an incursion by the hostiles,

495
00:41:23,410 --> 00:41:27,700
I should enter 7-7, so I entered 7-7.

496
00:41:35,340 --> 00:41:36,910
We should go.

497
00:41:37,010 --> 00:41:40,880
If anyone's around, this explosion's goingto attract their attention.
