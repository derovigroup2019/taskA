00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:02,519
<i>Previously on Lost:</i>

2
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:04,033
You brought me to operate.

3
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:06,998
You think I trust you,
that I'm gonna just do the surgery

4
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:08,957
and hope that you let me go?

5
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:12,271
Jack... you have to do it.

6
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:14,828
How did they get you to ask me?
What did they offer?

7
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:16,399
- Nothing!
- Why are you here?

8
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:18,232
They're gonna kill Sawyer!

9
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:26,072
Tomorrow morning, first thing.

10
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:28,310
I'll get it out,
and I'll keep you alive.

11
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:31,874
I'm ready.

12
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:35,631
No! No! Sawyer, please!

13
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:37,438
You get your hands off of him!

14
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:42,189
I made a small incision
in Ben's kidney sack.

15
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:46,077
Now, if I don't stitch that back up
in the next hour, he's dead.

16
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:48,628
Now get in here
and bring that walkie-talkie!

17
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:35,354
Hello.

18
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:19,433
I fell asleep?

19
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:22,114
With candles burning.
That's real safe.

20
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:29,510
We don't have to
keep doing this, you know.

21
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:33,915
Are you saying that because
you don't think it's gonna work?

22
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,150
Or because you're afraid
he'll find out?

23
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:41,751
Lift up your shirt.

24
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:59,434
OK.

25
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:04,678
- Some doctor you are.
- I'm not doing this as your doctor,

26
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:06,591
I'm doing it as your sister.

27
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,951
I don't like you being here alone.

28
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:12,553
Come stay with me.

29
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:15,518
I like living on the beach.

30
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:18,273
This is Miami, Rachel.

31
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:20,476
Everything's on the beach.

32
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:28,955
You have an hour head start
before they come.

33
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:30,871
Take the walkie, take Sawyer, go.

34
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,109
<i>Wait, where are you?</i>

35
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:35,636
Kate, just listen to me! Do you remember
what I told you on the beach?

36
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:39,030
Do you remember what story I told you
when you were stitching me up?

37
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:42,951
- Do you remember it?
- Yes! Yes! I remember!

38
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:47,708
When you get safe,
you radio me and you tell me that story.

39
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:48,789
<i>Jack, please...</i>

40
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:52,350
If you don't call in an hour, I'll know
something went wrong and he dies!

41
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:55,035
<i>- I can't leave without you!
- Yes, you are. Go.</i>

42
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:57,156
- Jack, I can't!
- Go! Now!

43
00:03:57,240 --> 00:04:00,038
- I can't!
- Kate! Damn it! Run!

44
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:07,713
Juliet, stop the bleeding
and stitch him up.

45
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:10,031
She's not a surgeon.
She can't fix this.

46
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:13,714
He's right.

47
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:23,748
Let's go.

48
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,514
<i>- Warning.
- Sawyer, let's go!</i>

49
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:29,715
<i>- Warning.
- Sawyer!</i>

50
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:44,517
Then what the hell
do you suggest we do?

51
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,479
Go get Danny,

52
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:51,075
then find Austen and Ford
and bring them back.

53
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:53,720
No. You do that and Ben dies.

54
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:55,950
- Go.
- No, you think I'm lying?

55
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:58,713
You think that this is a bluff?
I will let him die.

56
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,313
No. Jack. You won't.

57
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:04,675
Go. Get them back.

58
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:07,431
If you have to...

59
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:09,874
...kill them.

60
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:49,439
<i>- Hello?
- Dr Burke?</i>

61
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:52,114
<i>- Yes.
- It's Diana from Mittelos BioScience.</i>

62
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:54,919
<i>- Confirming your appointment tomorrow.
- 2.00, right?</i>

63
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,629
<i>2.00. Dr Alpert asked me to tell you
he's looking forward to meeting you.</i>

64
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,790
<i>- Me, too. Thank you.
- Goodbye.</i>

65
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:52,159
Stay here.

66
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:59,678
- Hello, Juliet.
- Hey.

67
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,072
Hey, Ed.

68
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:08,112
Why exactly are you here?

69
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:11,112
Oh, today's lab work,

70
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:14,715
I got home and I realized
that I inverted some numbers.

71
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,518
It couldn't wait until morning?

72
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,878
- Edmund?
- I'm sorry.

73
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,354
How rude of me.

74
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:26,671
Juliet, this is Sherry.
Sherry, this is Juliet...

75
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:28,996
...my ex-wife.

76
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,279
Juliet's leaving.

77
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:36,753
I am.

78
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:40,912
Jules...

79
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:44,877
...could you please turn off the lights?

80
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:59,477
You haven't thought this through.
Your plan's not going to work.

81
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:01,073
Yeah? Why's that?

82
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:04,789
Your friends won't make it to your side,
because we're not on that island.

83
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:09,114
We're on a smaller island,
two miles off shore.

84
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,792
Afraid so.

85
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:21,558
So, why don't we see if we can come up
with some kind of peaceful resolution.

86
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:26,235
- A peaceful resolution?
- That's right.

87
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:29,915
Is that what you call asking me to kill
Ben while on the operating table?

88
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,468
- "Make it look like an accident"?
- Ridiculous.

89
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:35,870
- What are you trying to do, Jack?
- She said if I did, she'd protect me!

90
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:37,473
Enough!

91
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:43,038
Juliet, get out.

92
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:47,191
- Tom, he's lying!
- You said you can't stitch him up?

93
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:49,999
Then you don't need to be in here.

94
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:51,149
Go, Julie.

95
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,231
Don't let him fool you.

96
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:02,754
He'll never let a patient just die.

97
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:08,673
Hey!

98
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:10,876
Hey! Can anybody hear me?

99
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:15,636
- What happened?
- Open the cage!

100
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:18,188
- Where's...
- Just open the damn cage!

101
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:38,032
That's our island?

102
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:39,758
You didn't believe me before?

103
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:40,989
We need a boat.

104
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:43,071
And a couple of towels
and a buffet lunch.

105
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:45,549
We'll follow the beach.
There's got to be one.

106
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:47,517
How else do they get back and forth?

107
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:50,558
Well, why don't we just
stop and ask for directions?

108
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:55,390
<i>- Jack, are you there?
- Yeah?</i>

109
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:57,118
<i>- Yeah, I'm here.
- Are you OK?</i>

110
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,555
- I'm fine.
- Tell him I said hi. Get to the point!

111
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:03,030
Jack, we need a boat. We need
some way to get off of this island.

112
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:06,036
You heard her.

113
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:07,997
How do they get off this island?

114
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,035
What's he doing?

115
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:13,436
Kate? Kate!

116
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:18,309
Kate!

117
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:23,874
Come on!

118
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,552
Come on! Go! Go, go!

119
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:07,759
This way!

120
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:10,392
Jason, you all right?

121
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,394
They're over there!

122
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:25,913
Come on! Get inside! Get inside! Go!

123
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,312
Come on!

124
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:37,756
Be quiet, be quiet, be quiet!

125
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:42,389
Be quiet...

126
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:45,319
Where'd they go?

127
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:46,753
That way.

128
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:58,357
Nice to meet you, Sheena.

129
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:02,112
Is it true?

130
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:04,475
- Is what true?
- What you said.

131
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:07,834
Did Juliet really ask you to kill him?

132
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:13,315
Yeah, and in about 40 minutes,
she's gonna get her wish.

133
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:14,719
Hey...

134
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:23,357
That's not helping...

135
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:25,593
...anything.

136
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:31,591
Now...

137
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:35,636
...could somebody please get Juliet?

138
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:46,838
Juliet?

139
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:49,631
Edmund wants to see you in his office.

140
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:53,191
Do you work here?

141
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:55,271
I'm the new research assistant.

142
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,911
Of course you are.

143
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:15,119
I want in.

144
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:19,836
- In on what?
- I know what you're doing, Juliet.

145
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,833
- I'm not really sure what you...
- I read your notes.

146
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:27,278
I know what you took from the lab.

147
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:28,952
The only thing I don't know is...

148
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,878
...who's your guinea pig?

149
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:36,112
Ed, I've...

150
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:40,239
I've been doing my research
in my own lab on my own time.

151
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:43,073
- I don't really see how...
- It's your sister, isn't it?

152
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:48,519
Jules, there's two ways
this plays out.

153
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:53,753
One is your research is potentially...

154
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:55,114
...genius.

155
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:57,753
And the other...

156
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:01,876
...it raises some very
serious ethical questions.

157
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:05,234
Maybe even criminal concerns.

158
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:08,755
But if you collaborate with me...

159
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:13,238
...based on my reputation,

160
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:17,233
all this is viewed
as cutting-edge science.

161
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:22,116
And we will win prizes
and drink champagne...

162
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:25,790
...and do a lot of good for people.

163
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:37,515
Why don't I give you time
to think about it?

164
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:55,239
Juliet.

165
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:59,113
Ben's awake.

166
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:01,915
How?

167
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:06,592
Shephard says he's a spinal surgeon,
not an anaesthesiologist.

168
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:10,071
Ben's asking for you.

169
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:22,231
This a hobby of yours,
Underdog, digging holes?

170
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:25,630
Yep. That and basket weaving.
Want one?

171
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:30,877
- Have a tunnel to the mainland?
- No, but I've got a boat.

172
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:34,631
- Can we use it?
- Yeah.

173
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:37,188
- But we've got to hurry.
- Hold on a second, sister.

174
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:39,669
You happen to find us
in the woods, you have a boat

175
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:41,716
and you're gonna let us use it?

176
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:45,156
There's something we need to do first.

177
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:48,115
My boyfriend is being held prisoner.

178
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:51,875
If you help me rescue him, I promise
I'll get you back to the other island.

179
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:54,277
Your boyfriend,

180
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:56,794
his name happen to be "Karl"?

181
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:00,592
Yeah.

182
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:03,118
Come on.

183
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:10,919
- I stopped the surgery.
- I know.

184
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,356
I've been able to hear you
for a few minutes now.

185
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:17,511
It's very clever of you.

186
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:19,511
I should have seen it coming.

187
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:24,394
- Are you in pain? I can...
- No.

188
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:27,556
But thanks all the same.

189
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:43,836
I'd like to speak to Juliet alone,
please, Jack.

190
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:45,478
No, no, I'm sorry.

191
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:48,916
Please. I'm asking you.

192
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,719
One gentleman to another.

193
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:56,030
It won't hurt you to give me
three minutes, will it?

194
00:16:57,560 --> 00:17:00,791
Knowing I have only 27 left.

195
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:16,075
- If you touch him, if you try to...
- I won't.

196
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:22,193
You've got three minutes.

197
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:47,038
I'm Tom, by the way.

198
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:09,156
They've got history.

199
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:28,510
I would like for you
to go back in there,

200
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:30,955
put Ben under and finish the surgery.

201
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,794
And why would I wanna do that?

202
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:38,553
Because I'm going to go
help your friends escape.

203
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:53,475
Thank you for taking the time to
let us make our pitch, Dr Burke.

204
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:57,758
Mittelos BioScience is based in Oregon,
we're just outside of Portland.

205
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:05,633
These shots might seem cheeseball,
but our people really are this happy.

206
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:10,157
Now, why? Because we're privately
funded. Privately funded means freedom.

207
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:16,317
We organize trips every week
in and around the Portland area,

208
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:20,598
which is just awesome for hiking,
and biking, and river running.

209
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:27,151
Look, when your company
reached out to me, I was flattered,

210
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:29,470
but I don't really know why
you would want me.

211
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:33,758
Is it true that you successfully
impregnated a male field mouse?

212
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:37,470
Well, he didn't carry to term.

213
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:41,193
- You mind if I ask you something?
- Sure.

214
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:47,072
What do you see?

215
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:51,957
Well... it's a human womb, obviously.

216
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:56,911
Judging from the decomposition of the
endometrium, I'd say the woman was 70.

217
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:01,118
- Actually, she's 26.
- What happened to her?

218
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:05,034
What if I told you that you could have
complete freedom and money to find out?

219
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:09,388
We think you're special, Dr Burke.

220
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:11,869
We want you to lead a team
of highly trained people

221
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:14,235
because we think
you're just that good.

222
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,598
I can't.

223
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:19,117
Why can't you?

224
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:21,156
My ex-husband wouldn't let me.

225
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:23,993
- He wouldn't give you this opportunity?
- No.

226
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:25,877
He would never give the OK.

227
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:28,315
- We could reach out to him.
- Don't bother.

228
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:32,109
- Must be something he'd respond to.
- If he were hit by a bus.

229
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:33,394
That would work.

230
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:39,110
- That was totally inappropriate.
- No.

231
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,150
I'm sorry that I wasted your time.

232
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:47,195
- Dr Burke, please, you...
- No. I'm sorry.

233
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:50,679
Whatever you think I am, I'm not.

234
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:54,080
I'm not a leader, Mr Alpert.

235
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,472
I'm a mess.

236
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:39,992
Oh, hell.

237
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:52,511
Karl's gotta be in there.

238
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:54,511
What, you mean you ain't sure?

239
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:56,990
It's the only place I haven't looked.

240
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:59,719
- You know the guard?
- Yeah.

241
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:02,712
- His name's Aldo.
- "Aldo"?

242
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:08,271
OK, Lollipop, tell me how we're gonna
get by him with one gun and no bullets?

243
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:10,237
I've got an idea.

244
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:12,473
Of course you do.

245
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:16,429
- Open the door!
- Alex?

246
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:17,919
What the hell are you doing?

247
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,549
They got out of their cages! I caught
them in the jungle. Now open up!

248
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:25,713
Just stop! You're not supposed to be
here. Your dad's gonna kill you!

249
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:29,395
My dad was the one who told me
to bring them here, to you.

250
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:33,632
Look, maybe you should call him.
I'm sure he's got nothing better to do.

251
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:45,316
<i>- Danny, I need Ben.
- Why?</i>

252
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:48,198
I got Alex here, she's got
Austen and Ford with her...

253
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:52,275
<i>Damn it! Whatever she says
don't believe it!</i>

254
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:54,476
<i>You hold them right there,
I'm on my...</i>

255
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:59,552
Don't get mad at me because you fell
for the old Wookiee Prisoner gag.

256
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,833
- Where's Karl?
- What are you talking about?

257
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:04,876
Shoot him in the knee.

258
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:08,149
- What?
- We don't have time. I'll do it.

259
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:14,029
OK! All right! He's at the end of the
hall! Room 23! Keys are in my pocket!

260
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:23,279
Good con, I almost believed
you're gonna shoot him.

261
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:24,759
It wasn't a con.

262
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:26,868
Here it is!

263
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:32,675
Help!

264
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:34,195
Help!

265
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:44,709
You're OK. You're OK, Karl.

266
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:56,789
Is he OK?

267
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:59,474
We got your boyfriend back.
Where's your damn boat?

268
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:07,909
Idiot.

269
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:11,072
- Where are they?
- I don't know. Alex was with them.

270
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:12,434
Danny!

271
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:15,233
We're letting them go.

272
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:17,436
- Letting 'em go?
- Ben gave the order.

273
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:19,431
- Ben's in surgery.
- He woke up.

274
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:21,670
- He woke up?
- Shephard won't do the surgery

275
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:25,912
unless he knows his friends are off
the island. Do you want Ben to die?

276
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:29,151
I know Ben would rather die
than let them go!

277
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:44,233
Hey.

278
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:46,713
How was the interview?

279
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:49,838
It's not for me.

280
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:52,196
- What?
- It's fine.

281
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:54,874
They're too far away anyway.
It's Portland.

282
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:58,919
- You didn't say no because of me?
- Why would I want to go to Portland

283
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,036
for research that doesn't even work?

284
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:04,677
Because it does work.

285
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,672
I'm pregnant.

286
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:18,636
I'm pregnant.

287
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:22,719
- What?
- Look, look...

288
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:24,313
I took a blood test, too.

289
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:26,470
I didn't want to tell you
till I was sure.

290
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:31,551
- It worked.
- Yeah.

291
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:41,033
My whole life,
all I ever wanted was to have a baby

292
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:43,475
and now because of you I can!

293
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:50,390
God, now I just need to get healthy!

294
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:53,871
Now I just need to get healthy

295
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:56,838
so I can see the bugger
get into an Ivy League school.

296
00:26:58,280 --> 00:27:00,840
Of course you will. You will.

297
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:04,833
Now you can tell that bastard ex-husband
of yours what he can do with his ethics.

298
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:12,152
Because you're insufferable,
and you're mean.

299
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:15,275
You asked me for the truth,
Mom, and that...

300
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:16,952
Ed.

301
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:21,276
Let me call you later, OK?
OK, bye.

302
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:24,477
- Hello, Jules. What's up?
- She's pregnant.

303
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:28,513
- Excuse me?
- It worked. Rachel's pregnant.

304
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:37,072
Wow.

305
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:41,110
I need to see your labs.
We'll have to verify the data.

306
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:42,872
No.

307
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:44,871
I'm not interested in publishing, Ed.

308
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:47,678
It's my sister.

309
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:50,832
Fine. If you're not interested,
why are you concerned if...

310
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:13,237
- You OK?
- Yeah.

311
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:15,629
I just don't like blood too much.

312
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:20,438
Well, then you probably
won't want to be looking at that.

313
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:26,758
So, if you really
can get off the island,

314
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:28,990
why didn't you just
take him to a facility?

315
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:31,071
Why all this?

316
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:34,038
Because ever since
the sky turned purple, we...

317
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:38,875
- What the hell happened?
- I just nicked an artery.

318
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:43,472
- Isn't that what you already did?
- Yeah, well, that was on purpose.

319
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:45,595
Can you fix it?

320
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:47,955
Damn it!

321
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:55,359
- You got him?
- I got him.

322
00:28:57,560 --> 00:28:58,913
- Karl?
- Nice ride.

323
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,594
- Karl, we're gonna go now, OK?
- Help me.

324
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:04,877
Can you stand? OK. Come on.

325
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:11,029
So... you're the boss's daughter?

326
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:15,196
I never saw that coming.
Let's go, Cheech.

327
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:18,315
We're going for a little ride.

328
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:20,630
- Careful.
- All right. Easy.

329
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:23,750
I'm gonna put you in the boat,
all right?

330
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:26,198
Wait, wait.

331
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:29,795
- Are you OK?
- Danny.

332
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:31,552
No. "Sawyer. "

333
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:34,351
Danny!

334
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:49,710
- No!
- Danny!

335
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:08,438
- What happened?
- I can't see.

336
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:10,636
- What?
- There's too much blood.

337
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:12,312
All right, get over here.

338
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:15,119
Tom, he is going to die
if you don't get over here now.

339
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,479
Go.

340
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,479
Get out of here.

341
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:26,553
You heard the lady.

342
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:31,035
- Let's go!
- Not you, Alex.

343
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:34,388
- You're staying.
- Why?

344
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:35,959
We both know your father.

345
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:39,396
And the only way he'll let Karl live
is if you're here when he wakes up.

346
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:44,872
I'm sorry, Alex.

347
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:54,958
Hey, Alex.

348
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:56,553
Hey.

349
00:30:57,240 --> 00:30:59,276
I missed you.

350
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:02,318
I know. I missed you, too.

351
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:06,788
You have to go away now...

352
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:09,394
...but I'll see you real soon, OK?

353
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:11,155
I love you.

354
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:18,279
I have to go to sleep now.

355
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:31,389
Wait.

356
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:36,518
Easy. OK. Easy.

357
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:41,229
Wait, wait...

358
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:44,073
Keep it steady, damn it!
Hold it steady.

359
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:48,472
<i>Jack, are you there?</i>

360
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:56,636
All right, hold that up to me.
The walkie. Hold it up to me.

361
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:58,995
- What about the suction?
- Just do it!

362
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:07,238
Yeah, I'm here, Kate. You OK?

363
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:11,829
Yeah, I... We've got a boat.
They're letting us go.

364
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:13,389
Who's letting you go?

365
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:16,592
The blonde woman.

366
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:19,717
- So you're safe? You and Sawyer?
- Yes! Yeah.

367
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:22,759
- Tell me.
- Tell you?

368
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:26,078
On the beach, the day of the crash,
the story I told you.

369
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:28,276
If you're safe, tell me.

370
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:31,158
- You think this is the best time to...
- Shut up!

371
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:36,875
You... were doing a surgery on a girl.

372
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:40,958
And you messed up.

373
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:42,519
You made a mistake.

374
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:48,478
<i>You tore something on her back
and all the nerves came loose.</i>

375
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:54,276
And you said you were so afraid.

376
00:32:56,680 --> 00:32:58,432
<i>And you said the fear was so...</i>

377
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:01,993
...real.

378
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:05,031
And you didn't know what to do.

379
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:11,238
So you counted to five.

380
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:16,437
<i>And then you weren't afraid anymore.</i>

381
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:20,271
<i>And then it was just gone.</i>

382
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:25,713
And you fixed her.

383
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,956
<i>You saved her.</i>

384
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:48,916
I need you to make me a promise, Kate.

385
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:50,435
Jack?

386
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:53,193
Promise me that you'll never
come back here for me.

387
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:56,628
Don't come back, Kate.

388
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:59,393
- Jack, where are you?
- Turn it off.

389
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:01,869
<i>Jack? Jack! Please, where are...?</i>

390
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:15,394
Trades are coming up.

391
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:19,757
We gotta go.

392
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:24,758
- Let's go.
- OK.

393
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:14,390
We have some paperwork
we need you to sign...

394
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:17,190
...but take your time,
there's no rush.

395
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:18,713
Thank you.

396
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:20,871
Were you able to remove the tumour?

397
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:25,559
Yeah.

398
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:32,193
You'll want to do a biopsy,
see if it's malignant.

399
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:40,916
So, what now?
I just go back to my cell?

400
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,150
Until they figure out
what to do with you.

401
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:49,953
"They. "

402
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:56,229
What'd he say?

403
00:36:57,320 --> 00:36:59,550
- I'm sorry?
- Ben.

404
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:02,954
What did he say that made you
want to save his life?

405
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:09,151
It doesn't really matter what he said.

406
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:10,468
It matters to me.

407
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:15,790
After everything that
I have been put through...

408
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:19,236
...you owe me an answer.

409
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:22,156
And I wanna know what he said.

410
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:41,629
Tissue?

411
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:44,914
Thank you. Thanks.

412
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:58,477
- Have we met?
- Hello, Dr Burke.

413
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:04,799
- Mr Alpert?
- I'm... so sorry for your loss.

414
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:08,633
What are you doing here?

415
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:12,793
I saw what happened on the news and
your office said you were down here.

416
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:15,997
I just wanted to express
my condolences in person

417
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:17,638
before I went back to Portland.

418
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:19,711
This is Ethan,
he's one of my colleagues.

419
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:21,438
It's a pleasure to meet you.

420
00:38:28,120 --> 00:38:29,872
He was hit by a bus.

421
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:32,872
I know. They say you were there
when it happened. It must...

422
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:35,838
No, no. In our interview...

423
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:40,909
I said that I wanted him
to get hit by a bus.

424
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:46,512
Dr Burke, I realize you're
a little shook up right now,

425
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:48,875
but this is just a tragic accident.

426
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:50,552
You can't blame yourself.

427
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:53,510
I don't even remember you saying that.

428
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:00,908
Why are you here, Mr Alpert?

429
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:04,470
Look, I know the timing is horrible,

430
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:08,792
but we came because we're that serious
about getting you to come work with us.

431
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:13,552
Just give us six months.

432
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:17,076
If you need to, you can be back
before your sister gives birth.

433
00:39:19,240 --> 00:39:21,800
- How did you know that my?
- We're very thorough

434
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:23,552
in our recruitment process.

435
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:34,672
Can my sister come?

436
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:36,557
Won't work, we're pretty remote.

437
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:39,677
She wouldn't have access
to the treatment that she needs.

438
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:42,672
But it's Portland.
There's plenty of clinics and...

439
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:45,271
We're not quite in Portland.

440
00:39:55,640 --> 00:39:57,471
I want to know what he said.

441
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:06,790
I've been on this island
for three years, Jack.

442
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:10,955
Three years, two months, and 28 days.

443
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:15,918
He said that if I...

444
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:19,593
...let him live...

445
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:23,238
...and I helped you...

446
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:31,119
...that he would finally
let me go home.
