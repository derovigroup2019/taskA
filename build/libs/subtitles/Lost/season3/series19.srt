1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,300
<i> PREVIOUSLY ON LOST </i>

1
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:03,800
YOU STOLE MY KIDNEY...

1
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,300
YOU NEEDED A FATHER,
AND I NEEDED A KIDNEY.

2
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:07,400
GET OVER IT.

3
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:10,200
AAH!

4
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:15,400
I KNOW YOU WERE RAISED
IN FOSTER CARE.

5
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:16,700
I KNOW YOU SPENT THE FOUR YEARS

6
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:19,200
PRIOR TO YOUR ARRIVAL
ON THIS ISLAND IN A WHEELCHAIR,

7
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:21,100
AND I KNOW
HOW YOU ENDED UP IN IT.

8
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:23,800
WHAT IF I TOLD YOU
THAT SOMEWHERE ON THIS ISLAND,

9
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:26,000
THERE'S A VERY LARGE BOX,

10
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:30,200
AND WHATEVER YOU IMAGINED,
WHATEVER YOU WANTED TO BE IN IT,

11
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:34,700
WHEN YOU OPENED THAT BOX,
THERE IT WOULD BE?

12
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,700
I'D SAY I HOPE
THAT BOX IS BIG ENOUGH

13
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:38,800
TO IMAGINE YOURSELF UP
NEW SUBMARINE.

14
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:48,600
WELL, JOHN, YOU'VE REALLY
GONE AND DONE IT NOW.

15
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:49,600
YOU'RE NOT

16
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:51,600
ABOUT THE MAGIC BOX AGC BO
ARE YOU?

17
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:54,600
NO, JOHN. I'M GONNA SHOW YOU
WHAT CAME OUT OF IT.

18
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:58,300
DAD?

19
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:22,100
SAVE YOUR BREATH.

20
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,500
NOBODY'S GONNA HEAR YOU.

21
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:43,300
DAD?

22
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:49,100
WHAT IS THIS?

23
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:52,400
YOU TELL ME.
YOU BROUGHT HIM HERE.

24
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:53,800
I DIDN'T BRING HIM HERE.

25
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:56,600
I'D BE CAREFUL ABOUT GETTING
TOO CLOSE TO HIM, JOHN.

26
00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:00,000
WELL, WHERE DID YOU FIND HIM?
WHY DID YOU BRING HIM HERE?

27
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,600
I'VE ALREADY SAID...
 <i>WE</i> DIDN'T--

28
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:04,200
YOU WANT ME TO ASK HIM
HOW HE GOT HERE?

29
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:05,300
BE MY GUEST.

30
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:08,500
TOM!

31
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:12,400
I WARNED YOU, JOHN.

32
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:16,400
DON'T YOU KNOW, JOHN?

33
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:19,400
DON'T YOU KNOW
WHERE WE ARE?

34
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:26,100
WHAT DID HE MEAN?

35
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:27,100
I'M AFRAID
WE DON'T HAVE TIME

36
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:29,000
TO DEAL WITH THAT
RIGHT NOW, JOHN.

37
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:31,700
WE'RE LEAVING FIRST THING
IN THE MORNING, ALL OF US.

38
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:32,500
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

39
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,300
WE'RE GOING TO A NEW PLACE.

40
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:39,700
WELL, AN OLD PLACE,
ACTUALLY.

41
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:43,000
WOULD YOU LIKE
TO COME WITH US?

42
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:50,500
YES.

43
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:51,900
GOOD.

44
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:56,100
WE'RE HOLDING KATE
A FEW BUILDINGS OVER FROM HERE.

45
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:58,200
MAYBE YOU'D LIKE
TO SAY GOOD-BYE.

46
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:23,500
HEY, WHERE YOU GOING?

47
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:27,100
I CAN'T SLEEP
IF I'M NOT IN MY OWN TENT.

48
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:30,400
FINE.
LET'S GO TO YOUR TENT.

49
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:36,200
UM...

50
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:38,500
IT'S NOTHING PERSONAL.
IT'S...

51
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:41,400
OLD HABITS, YOU KNOW?

52
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:46,700
FINE. SCRAM.

53
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,200
YOU WANT ME
TO WALK YOU HOME?

54
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:53,800

I THINK I'LL MAKE IT.

00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:57,400
ARE YOU SURE?
I GOTTA PEE ANYWAY.

56
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:00,300

00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:29,300
LOOKING FOR YOU, ACTUALLY.

00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:33,600
OKAY, TARZAN.

00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,600
FROM
YOUR "BLOW UP EVERYTHING

68
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:36,400
THAT COULD GET US
F THE ISLAND" TOUR,

69
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:37,600
HOW 'BOUT YOU TELL ME
WHY YOU JOINED UP

70
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:38,700
WITH THE DAMN ENEMY?

71
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:41,800
I DIDN'T JOIN 'EM.
I INFILTRATED 'EM.

72
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:45,000
YOU'RE UNDERCOVER
WITH THE OTHERS.
THAT'S RIGHT.

73
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:47,200
NO HOW 'BOUT YOU GIVE ME
ONE REASON TO BELIEVE THAT?

74
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:49,600
BECAUSE A FEW HOURS AGO

75
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:52,000
I SNUCK INTO BEN'S TENT
AND KIDNAPPED HIM.

76
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:57,800
I TIEDIM UP, DRAGGED HIM
OFF INTO THE JUNGLE.

77
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:02,000
AND YOU CAME ALL THE WAY BACK
HERE TO TELL <i>ME</i> THIS BECAUSE...

78
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,300
BECAUSE THIS IS THE SAME MAN
WHO TORTURED YOU,

79
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:06,100
BEAT YOU, HUMILIATED YOU...

80
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:10,900
AND I WANT YOU TO KILL HIM.

81
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:18,200
YOU WANT HIM DEAD,
YOU KILL HIM.

82
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:20,000
I'M NOT A MURDERER.
NEITHER AM I.

83
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:22,200
EXCEPT FOR THE MAN
YOU KILLED IN SYDNEY.

84
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:26,300
THEY GOT FILES ON US,
JAMES--

85
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:28,400
ALL OF US.

86
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:32,000
YEAH, WELL, THEIR FILES
GOT THEIR FACTS WRONG.

87
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:40,900
THEN I MADE A MISTAKE
COMING TO YOU.

88
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:49,500
PLEASE DON'T TELL ANYONE
THAT I WAS HERE.

89
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:52,000
HEY, STOP!

90
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,200
I SAID STOP!

91
00:06:57,900 --> 00:06:59,300
DAMN IT! WAIT UP!

92
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:18,700
THERE.
THAT OUGHT TO DO IT.

93
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:19,500
THANKS.

94
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:22,600
THAT WOULD'VE TAKEN ME HOURS
TO DO MYSELF.

95
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:24,300
GL I COULD HELP.

96
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:29,200
DON'T MIND THEM.

97
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:31,000
THEY'RE ALL
JUST EXCITED YOU'RE HERE.

98
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:32,800
EXCITED?

99
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:34,600
WE'VE BEEN WAITING FOR YOU.

100
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:38,500
JOHN, YOU GOT A MINUTE?

101
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:39,500

BEN'S ASKING FOR YOU.

103
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:43,400
OKAY.

104
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:49,100
 <i>BEN, IT'S</i>

00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:51,300
 <i>KWON IS PREGNANT.</i>
 <i>THE FETUS IS HEALTHY</i>

106
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:53,900
 <i>AND WAS CONCEIVED ON ISLAND</i>
 <i>WITH HER HUSBAND.</i>

107
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:55,800
 <i>HE WAS STERILE</i>
 <i>WHEN THEY GOT HERE.</i>

108
00:07:57,700 --> 00:07:59,700
HELLO, JOHN.
THANKSOR COMING.

109
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
WHAT'S THAT?

110
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,700
JULIET IS GATHERING INFORMATION
FOR US AT YOUR FORMER CAMP.

111
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,200
SHE'S DETERMINING IF ANY
OF THE WOMEN ARE PREGNANT.

112
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,100
THEN WE'RE GONNA GO IN
AND...

113
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:11,900
TAKE THEM.

114
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:14,600
TAKE THEM?

115
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:18,400
THIS IS NOT THE FIRST TIME
WE'VE DONE THIS, JOHN.

116
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:19,900
TRUST ME,
NO ONE WILL GET HURT.

117
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:23,600
COULD YOU PASS ME THAT,
PLEASE?

118
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:29,500
THANK YOU.

119
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,700
I BELIEVE I HAVE YOU
TO THANK FOR THIS, JOHN.

120
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:37,100
ME?

121
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:38,900
A WEEK AGO,
I COULDN'T MOVE MY TOES...

122
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:43,400
BUT THE MINUTE YOU SHOWED UP,

123
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:46,800
I STARTED TO FEEL
PINS AND NEEDLES.

124
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:49,500
AND THIS IS
ONLY THE BEGINNING, JOHN.

125
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:51,900
I CAN'T WAIT TO SHOW YOUSH
WHAT THIS ISLAND CAN DO,

126
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:54,300
BUT UNFORTUNATELY,

127
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,900
YOU'RE NOT READY, JOHN.

128
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:00,500
UH, NO, I'M READY.

129
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:01,500
NO, JOHN, YOU'RE NOT.

130
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:05,100
YOU'RE STILL CRIPPLED
BY THE MEMORIES

131
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:07,800
OF THE MAN YOU USED TO BE
BEFORE YOU CAME TO THIS ISLAND,

132
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:09,700
AND YOU'LL NEVER BE FREE

133
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:13,000
UNTIL YOU RELEASE THE HOLD
THAT YOUR FATHER HAS OVER YOU.

134
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:16,800
WHY DO YOU THINK
YOU BROUGHT HIM HERE?

135
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:20,900
OH, OH, OH, THE MAGIC BOX.

136
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:23,100
OKAY, BEN,
HOW ABOUT YOU SHOW ME--

137
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:25,100
"MAGIC BOX"
IS A METAPHOR, JOHN.

138
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:27,500
I CAN'T SHOW YOU ANYTHING
UNTIL <i>YOU</i> CAN SHOW <i>ME</i>

139
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:29,400
THAT YOU'RE READY AND WILLING
TO BE ONE OF US.

140
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:31,800
WHEN PEOPLE JOIN US
HERE ON THIS ISLAND,

141
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:33,400
THEY NEED TO MAKE A GESTURE

142
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:36,600
OF FREE WILL, OF COMMITMENT.

143
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:41,000
THAT'S WHY YOU'RE GONNA
KILL YOUR FATHER.

144
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:07,900
HEY.
WHEN DID YOU GET BACK?

145
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:10,500
JACK, HEY. UH, LAST NIGHT.

146
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,500
WELL, EARLY THIS MORNING.

147
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:15,700
SO... CAMPING, HUH?

148
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,300
WHAT WERE YOU GUYS
DOING OUT THERE?

149
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:22,000
WE... FIGURED
WE'D EXPLORE A BIT, YOU KNOW.

150
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,900
SEE WHAT WAS FURTHER
DOWN THE BEACH.

151
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:26,100
MALE BONDING.

152
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:30,400
WELL, NEXT TIME YOU GO OUT,
SIGN ME UP.

153
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:32,000

THANKS, JIN.

155
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:48,700
WE HAVE TO TELL JACK

156
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:50,800
YEAH, I MEAN, SHOULDN'T HE
CHECK OUT HER WOUND?

157
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,900
CAN YOU GIVE ME YOUR WORD
THAT JACK CAN BE TRUSTED?

158
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,400
THAT HE SPENT TEN DAYS
WITH THOSE PEOPLE

159
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:56,600
AND THAT NOTHING
HAPPENED TO HIM?

160
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,400
AND THAT WOMAN HE'S SPENDING
ALL HIS TIME WITH...
JULIET.

161
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:03,200
AYE. JULIET. TWO WEEKS AGO,
SHE HAD YOUR FRIENDS IN CAGES.

162
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:06,400
NAOMI...

163
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:08,100
WELL, YOU HEARD
EVERYTHING THAT SHE SAID.

164
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:10,900
IF WE KEEP HER SAFE,

165
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:14,300
SHE'S OUR WAY
OFF THIS ISLAND.

166
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,300
SO GIVEN THAT,
DO YOU TRUST JACK,

167
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:20,700
OR DON'T YOU?

168
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,000
RIGHT.

169
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:29,300
SO WE TTER BRING IN
SOMEONE WE <i>CAN</i> TRUST.

170
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:38,400
OW!

171
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:40,500
YOU SHOULD'VE
PUT SOME SHOES ON.

172
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:42,500
YOU THINK?

173
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:46,200
SO WHAT ELSE IS IN IT?

174
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:48,200
IN WHAT?

175
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:51,500
THE FILE THEY GOT ON ME.

176
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,200
NOT MUCH.

177
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:57,900
THAT YOUR PARENTS DIED
WHEN YOU WERE VERY YOUNG.

178
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:00,100
BUT IT DOESN'T SAY WHY

179
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:03,900
YOUR FATHER
SHOT YOUR MOTHER...

180
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:08,800
OR WHY HE TURNED THE GUN
ON HIMSELF.

181
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:16,700
THAT MUST'VE BEEN
HARD FOR YOU.

182
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
G@
WHAT ELSE?

183
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:31,300
HIGH SCHOOL TRANSCRIPTS,
UH...

184
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:32,500
CRIMINAL RECORD...

185
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:35,500
ALL THE CON JOBS
YOU WERE ARRESTED FOR.

186
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:37,700
I GUESS THAT'S WHY
YOU USE AN ALIAS, HUH?

187
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:40,200
WHY DID YOU CHOOSE
THE NAME SAWYER? 

188
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,600
HOW STUPID
DO YOU THINK I AM?

189
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:45,400
I ALREADY BEEN CONNED
BY BEN ONCE.

190
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:48,100
MAYBE YOU HEARD ABOUT IT--BUNNY
WITH A NUMBER PAINTED ON IT?

191
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:49,700
YOU THINK I'M JUST GONNA
FOLLOW YOU THROUGH THE JUNGLE?

192
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:52,200
JAMES, PLEASE, YOU HAVE TO--
YOU HAVE TO TRUST ME.

193
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:54,100
WHERE ARE YOU TAKING ME?
TELL ME THE TRUTH!

194
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:57,100
WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME?
I'M BRINGING YOU THERE
TO DO EXACTLY WHAT I SAID--

195
00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:00,100
TO KILL BEN.
WHY DID U COME BACK
TO GET ME?

196
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:02,800
I HAD TO.
WHY ME?! WHY WON'T YOU
DO IT YOURSELF?

197
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,900
JAMES, PLEASE--
DON'T CALL ME JAMES!

198
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:07,300
WHY WON'T YOU
DO IT YOURSELF?

199
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:10,700
BECAUSE I CAN'T! I CAN'T!
I CAN'T DO IT!

200
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:16,200
THAT'S WHY
I CAME BACK FOR YOU.

201
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:27,300
GET UP.

202
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:34,900
I'LL GO TO WHEREVER
YOU GOT HIM,

203
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:37,100
BUT THEN WE'RE BRINGING HIM
BACK TO OUR CAMP.

204
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:39,200
I AIN'T KILLING NOBODY.
YOU UNDERSTAND ME?

205
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:43,600
YEAH. I UNDERSTAND...

206
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,600
BUT YOU'LL CHANGE YOUR MIND.

207
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:14,800
HEY, DUDE.

208
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:17,900
HELLO, HURLEY.

209
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,100
CAN YOU KEEP A SECRET?

210
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:39,700
YOU'VE ALREADY
SPOKEN TO HER?

211
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:42,300
YEAH, BUT YOU'RE GONNA
WANT TO HEAR IT FOR YOURSELF.

212
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:44,200
AND YOU HAVEN'T
TOLD JACK?

213
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:46,200
NO.

214
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:47,400
GOOD.

215
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:01,500
MY NAME'S SAYID JARRAH.

216
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,300
I UNDERSTAND YOUR HELICOPTER
CRASHED ONTO THE ISLAND.

217
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:06,200
ACTUALLY,
IT CRASHED IN THE WATER.

218
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:08,700
WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

219
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:11,300
NAOMI. NAOMI DORRIT.

220
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:14,400
NAOMI, FROM WHERE EXACTLY
DID YOU TAKE OFF?

221
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:16,600
A SHIP--FREIGHTER--

222
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:19,000
ABOUT 80 NAUTICAL MILES
WEST OF HERE.

223
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:21,400
I'M PART OF
A SEARCH AND RECOVERY TEAM.

224
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:25,400
YOU TOLD MY FRIENDS THE WRECKAGE
OF FLIGHT 815 WAS DISCOVERED.

225
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:27,300
DID YOU MEAN
THE PARTIAL WRECKAGE?

226
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:31,600
NO. THEY FOUND THE ENTIRE PLANE
OFF THE COAST OF BALI,

227
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:33,700
IN AN OCEAN TRENCH
4 MILES DEEP.

228
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:36,100
THEY SENT DOWN CAMERAS
IN THESE LITTLE ROBOTS

229
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:37,200
TO SURVEY THE WRECK.

230
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:40,000
THE BODIES WERE ALL THERE.

231
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:45,900
WELL, OBVIOUSLY
WE'RE NOT DEAD.

232
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:48,300
OBVIOUSLY.

233
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:49,900
SO IF YOU WEREN'T
LOOKING FOR US,

234
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:51,400
THEN WHO WERE YOU
LOOKING FOR?

235
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:53,400
HIM.

236
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:56,800
DESMOND?

237
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,900
MY COMPANY WAS HIRED BY A WOMAN
NAMED PENELOPE WIDMORE.

238
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,900
I DON'T KNOW WHY.
I NEVER MET HER.

239
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:03,800
SHE GAVE US
A SET OF COORDINATES.

240
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:05,100
WE'VE BEEN CONDUCTING

241
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:07,600
A DIFFERENTIAL
G.P.S. GRID SEARCH EVER SINCE.

242
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:10,000
YOU KNEW ABOUT THE ISLAND?

243
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:12,800
ISLAND?
WE WERE GIVEN COORDINATES

244
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:14,200
IN THE MIDDLE
OF THE BLOODY OCEAN.

245
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:16,200
WE THOUGHT
IT WAS A FOOL'S ERRAND

246
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:17,700
TILL THREE DAYS AGO.

247
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,700
I WAS FLYING BACK FOR THE SHIP,
WHEN ALL OF A SUDDEN

248
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:22,400
THE CLOUDS CLEARED,
AND I SAW LAND.

249
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:25,100
THE INSTRUMENTS
STARTED SPINNING.

250
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:26,700
I REALIZED I WAS GOING DOWN,

251
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:29,200
SO I GRABBED MY CHUTE,
AND I BAILED.

252
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:35,200
DID YOU ACTUALLY SEE
HER HELICOPTER?

253
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:38,100
NO.

254
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:40,000
YOU THINK I'M LYING, MATE?

255
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:41,800
I TAKE IT YOU HAVE NO MEANS
WHATSOEVER

256
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:43,900
OF COMMUNICATING
WITH THAT FREIGHTER OF YOURS?

257
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:48,500
WHAT WAS YOUR NAME? SAYID?

258
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:49,600
YES.

259
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:02,100
REMIND ME NOT TO RESCUE YOU,
SAYID.

260
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:23,800
AHH.

261
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,500
SO BEN--
YOU SAID I'D KILL HIM

262
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:33,800
WHEN I HEARD
WHAT HE'S GOT TO SAY.

263
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:36,900
THAT'S RIGHT.
WELL, YOU WANNA GIVE ME
A HEADS-UP?

264
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:39,400
IT'S NOT REALLY
MY PLACE TO TELL YOU.

265
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:46,600
LOOK, WHAT YOU READ
IN THAT FILE...

266
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
ABOUT THE GUY IN SYDNEY--

267
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:52,300
I THOUGHT
HE WAS SOMEONE ELSE.

268
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:54,600
I MADE A MISTAKE.
I DIDN'T MEAN TO KILL HIM.

269
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:58,000
WELL,
WHO'D YOU MEAN TO KILL?

270
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:08,500
ARE WE ALMOST THERE?

271
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:11,700
ALMOST.

272
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:27,500
WAKE UP, JOHN.

273
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:31,100
IT'S TIME.

274
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:05,800
I KNOW IT WON'T BE EASY,
BUT THE QUICKER THE BETTER.

275
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:11,700
YOU'RE KIDDING ME, RIGHT?

276
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:15,600
YOU EXPECT HIM TCTKILL ME?

277
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:19,800
JOHN?

278
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,300
THE HESITATION
THAT YOU'RE FEELING

279
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:24,000
IS JUST THE PART OF YOU
THAT STILL FEELS

280
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,400
LIKE HE HAS
A PERFECTLY GOOD EXPLANATION

281
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:27,600
FOR STEALING YOUR KIDNEY,

282
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,300
THROWING YOU
OUT OF AN 8-STORY WINDOW.

283
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:33,300
DON'T YOU WANNA
BE FREE FROM HIM?

284
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:37,700
THE HESITATION HE'S FEELING
IS BECAUSE HE IS A SPINELESS--

285
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:38,400
SHUT UP!

286
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:49,000
I GOTTA THINK--
DON'T THINK, JOHN.

287
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,800
YOU'RE WASTING YOUR TIME,
BUG-EYE.

288
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:52,900
ME AND HIM HAVE BEEN
THROUGH ALL THIS.

289
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:56,000
ALL HE WANTS IS HIS DADDY--
SHUT UP! I SAID SHUT UP!

290
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:03,600
YOU REALLY HAVEN'T
FIGURED IT OUT YET, HAVE YOU?

291
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:08,400
LET GO OF HIM, JOHN.

292
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,200
WHY ARE YOU
DOING THIS TO ME?

293
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:15,800
YOU'RE DOING THIS TO YOURSELF.
AS LONG AS HE'S STILL BREATHING,

294
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:19,100
YOU'LL STILL BE THAT
SAME SAD, PATHETIC LITTLE MAN

295
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:21,600
THAT WAS KICKED OFF
S WALKABOUT TOUR

296
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:24,300
BECAUSE YOU COULDN'T WALK.

297
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:50,400
I'LL BE HERE
THE REST OF THE WEEK, JOHN,

298
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:52,700
IF YOU CHANGE YOUR MIND--

299
00:21:08,330 --> 00:21:09,270
I'M SORRY.

300
00:21:12,430 --> 00:21:14,160
HE'S NOT WHO WE THOUGHT HE WAS.

301
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:08,110
SON OF A...

302
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:20,580
NICE PLACE YOU GOT HERE,LOCKE.

303
00:22:22,940 --> 00:22:24,370
BEN'S INSIDE IN THE BRIG.

304
00:22:25,660 --> 00:22:26,540
YOU READY?

305
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:30,200
YEAH,I'M READY.

306
00:22:51,350 --> 00:22:52,550
FRIENDS OF YOURS?

307
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:56,740
IT'S AN OLD SLAVING SHIP, MID-19th CENTURY.

308
00:23:04,010 --> 00:23:05,080
MY GUESS IS THEY...

309
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:07,470
CAPTURED THE SLAVES AND BROUGHT THEM HERE

310
00:23:07,490 --> 00:23:08,790
TO TRY AND MINE THE ISLAND.

311
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,040
WHAT'S IN THE BOXES?

312
00:23:14,610 --> 00:23:15,580
THAT'D BE DYNAMITE.

313
00:23:21,780 --> 00:23:23,220
SON OF A BITCH.

314
00:23:24,050 --> 00:23:25,810
YOU REALLY KIDNAPPED THE LITTLE BASTARD.

315
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:32,170
WE AIN'T KILLIN' HIM, LOCKE.

316
00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:35,410
WHATEVER YOU SAY,JAMES.

317
00:23:55,170 --> 00:23:56,250
WELL,WELL,WELL.

318
00:23:58,750 --> 00:23:59,700
HEY,HEY!

319
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:01,600
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!

320
00:24:01,620 --> 00:24:02,760
OPEN THE DAMN DOOR!

321
00:24:02,770 --> 00:24:03,710
SHUT UP!

322
00:24:04,310 --> 00:24:05,160
OPEN UP!

323
00:24:06,910 --> 00:24:09,230
I SAID SHUT UP!

324
00:24:15,170 --> 00:24:16,110
WHO THE HELL ARE YOU?

325
00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:21,760
IS THAT,LIKE,A RADIO? 
IT'S <i>LIKE</i> A RADIO,YES,

326
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:24,210
BUT I'VE NEVER SEEN EQUIPMENT THIS SOPHISTICATED.

327
00:24:24,910 --> 00:24:27,350
BUT YOU CAN STILL MAKE IT WORK,RIGHT? 
I HOPE SO.

328
00:24:29,660 --> 00:24:30,720
AND WHAT ABOUT THE OTHER PART?

329
00:24:32,170 --> 00:24:34,380
THE PART ABOUT THEY FOUND THE PLANE AND WE'RE ALL DEAD?

330
00:24:35,310 --> 00:24:36,290
ONE THING AT A TIME.

331
00:24:44,210 --> 00:24:45,830
THERE'S NOT A SINGLE AUDIBLE CHANNEL.

332
00:24:45,850 --> 00:24:47,640
WHATEVER THAT INTERFERENCE IS,

333
00:24:48,010 --> 00:24:50,580
IT'S BLOCKING OUR ABILITY TO SEND OUR OWN TRANSMISSION.

334
00:24:51,020 --> 00:24:51,740
IF W-

335
00:24:52,410 --> 00:24:54,590
WHAT'S THAT? IS THAT A RADIO?

336
00:24:55,940 --> 00:24:56,950
WHERE'YOU GET IT?

337
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:58,590
UH,THE LUGGAGE.

338
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,180
WHAT,YOU JUST FOUND A RADIO IN THE LUGGAGE?

339
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:05,690
KATE,IF I EXPLAIN,I WANT YOU TO KEEP THIS VERY QUIET.

340
00:25:06,970 --> 00:25:08,530
KEEP WHAT VERY QUIET?

341
00:25:11,180 --> 00:25:13,890

OPEN IT UP! I CAN HEAR YOU, YOU BALD BASTARD!

343
00:25:23,650 --> 00:25:24,560
ROUSSEAU?

344
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:26,880
LOCKE.

345
00:25:29,340 --> 00:25:30,830
WHAT BRINGS YOU TO "THE BLACK ROCK"?

346
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:33,310
DYNAMITE. AND YOU?

347
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:34,970
OPEN THIS DOOR!

348
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:37,950
OPEN UP!

349
00:25:42,650 --> 00:25:43,850
CRATES ARE RIGHT OVER THERE.

350
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:49,270
OPEN THIS DAMN DOOR!

351
00:25:49,290 --> 00:25:50,790
BE CAREFUL. IT'S UNSTABLE.

352
00:25:57,830 --> 00:26:00,460
LOCKE! LOCKE!

353
00:26:13,070 --> 00:26:14,090
IT'S BEAUTIFUL,ISN'T IT?

354
00:26:15,470 --> 00:26:17,090
NO MATTER HOW MUCH TIME YOU SPEND ON THE ISLAND,

355
00:26:17,110 --> 00:26:18,380
YOU JUST NEVER GET TIRED OF THIS VIEW.

356
00:26:19,110 --> 00:26:21,350
WE HAVEN'T BEEN FORMALLY INTRODUCED.

357
00:26:21,370 --> 00:26:22,280
I'M RICHARD.

358
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:26,090
YOU MIND IF I JOIN YOU?

359
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:26,950
OH,SURE.

360
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:35,300
HE WANTED TO EMBARRASS YOU.

361
00:26:36,290 --> 00:26:37,240
I'M SORRY?

362
00:26:37,610 --> 00:26:39,660
BEN KNEW YOU WEREN'T GONNA KILL YOUR OWN FATHER.

363
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:44,110
HE PUT YOU IN FRONT OF EVERYONE IN OUR CAMP

364
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:45,680
JUST SO THEY COULD ALL WATCH YOU FAIL.

365
00:26:47,750 --> 00:26:48,630
WHY?

366
00:26:52,550 --> 00:26:53,890
'CAUSE WHEN WORD GOT BACK HERE

367
00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:56,590
THAT THERE WAS A MAN WITH A BROKEN SPINE ON THE PLANE

368
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:59,010
WHO COULD SUDDENLY WALK AGAIN,WELL...

369
00:26:59,030 --> 00:27:01,170
PEOPLE HERE BEGAN TO GET VERY EXCITED,

370
00:27:01,190 --> 00:27:02,070
BECAUSTHAT...

371
00:27:03,710 --> 00:27:04,590
THAT COULD ONLY HAPPEN

372
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:06,720
TO SOMEONE WHO WAS EXTREMELY SPECIAL.

373
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:11,550
NOW BEN DOESN'T WANT ANYONE TO THINK YOU'RE SPECIAL,JOHN.

374
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:14,240
AND WHY ARE YOU TELLING ME THIS?

375
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:17,710
BEN HAS BEEN WASTING OUR TIME

376
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:21,000
WITH NOVELTIES LIKE FERTILITY PROBLEMS.

377
00:27:21,830 --> 00:27:24,200
WE'RE LOOKING FOR SOMEONE TO REMIND US

378
00:27:24,220 --> 00:27:26,140
THAT WE'RE HERE FOR MORE IMPORTANT REASONS.

379
00:27:28,590 --> 00:27:29,670
WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME?

380
00:27:29,690 --> 00:27:31,540
I WANT FOR YOU TO FIND YOUR PURPOSE,

381
00:27:32,470 --> 00:27:33,410
AND TO DO THAT,

382
00:27:34,370 --> 00:27:36,130
YOUR FATHER HAS TO GO,JOHN,

383
00:27:37,550 --> 00:27:38,910
AND SINCE YOU'RE NOT GOING TO DO IT...

384
00:27:45,890 --> 00:27:47,260
I'M GONNA SUGGEST SOMEONE ELSE.

385
00:27:52,970 --> 00:27:53,850
SAWYER?

386
00:27:55,100 --> 00:27:57,830
WHY WOULD SAWYER KILL MY FATHER? HE DOESN'T EVEN KNOW HIM.

387
00:27:57,850 --> 00:27:58,920
KEEP READING.

388
00:28:04,210 --> 00:28:05,380
OPEN THIS DAMN DOOR!

389
00:28:06,310 --> 00:28:07,710
SON OF A BITCH!

390
00:28:17,390 --> 00:28:19,250
I'M POINTIN' MY GUN AT YOU,JOHN-BOY.

391
00:28:19,650 --> 00:28:21,510
YOU GOT THREE SECONDS TO OPEN THIS DOOR.

392
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:24,750
YOU'RE NOT GONNA SHOOT ANYONE,JAMES.

393
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:26,740
ONE...

394
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:29,620
TWO!

395
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:31,850
IF THERE WERE ANY BULLETS IN THAGUN,

396
00:28:31,860 --> 00:28:33,650
WHY WOULD YOU HOLD A KNIFE TO MY THROAT?

397
00:28:37,940 --> 00:28:38,850
UGH!

398
00:28:38,860 --> 00:28:40,100
SON OF A BITCH!

399
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:42,660
GUESS I DIDN'T RAISE NO DUMMIES.

400
00:28:43,390 --> 00:28:46,600
WHAT THE HELL'S THAT MEAN? 
IT MEANS THAT "BALD-HEADED BASTARD"

401
00:28:46,610 --> 00:28:48,390
OUTSIDE THE DOOR IS MY SON.

402
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:51,530
COME AGAIN?

403
00:28:51,540 --> 00:28:55,260
MY SON, AS IN I'M HIS FATHER.

404
00:28:55,770 --> 00:28:57,040
YOU DO SPEAK ENGLISH?

405
00:28:57,050 --> 00:28:57,990
YOU'RE...

406
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:05,530
HOW DID YOU GET HERE-- TO THE ISLAND?

407
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:07,110
ISLAND?

408
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:08,950
OKAY.

409
00:29:09,670 --> 00:29:12,730
I'M DRIVING DOWN I-10 THROUGH TALLAHASSEE,WHEN BAM--

410
00:29:13,230 --> 00:29:15,320
SOMEBODY SLAMS INTO THE BACK OF MY CAR.

411
00:29:17,570 --> 00:29:20,600
I GO RIGHT INTO THE DIVIDER AT 70 MILES AN HOUR.

412
00:29:20,620 --> 00:29:21,850
THE NEXT THING I KNOW,

413
00:29:21,870 --> 00:29:24,180
THE PARAMEDICS ARE STRAPPING ME TO A GURNEY,

414
00:29:24,190 --> 00:29:25,850
STUFFING ME IN THE BACK OF AN AMBULANCE,

415
00:29:25,850 --> 00:29:28,130
AND ONE OF THEM ACTUALLY SMILES AT ME

416
00:29:28,150 --> 00:29:32,050
AS HE POPS THE I.V. IN MY ARM, AND THEN... NOTHING.

417
00:29:32,620 --> 00:29:34,240
JUST BLACK.

418
00:29:36,250 --> 00:29:38,770
AND THE NEXT THING I KNOW, I WAKE UP IN A DARK ROOM

419
00:29:38,780 --> 00:29:41,810
TIED UP,GAG IN MY MOUTH, AND WHEN THE DOOR OPENS,

420
00:29:41,830 --> 00:29:45,140
I'M LOOKING UP AT THE SAME MAN I THREW OUT A WINDOW--

421
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:47,470
JOHN LOCKE,

422
00:29:48,340 --> 00:29:50,030
MY DEAD SON.

423
00:30:00,330 --> 00:30:02,350
AND HE'S DEAD 'CAUSE YOU THREW HIM OUT A WINDOW?

424
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:06,360
NO,HE SURVIVED THAT, BUT IT PARALYZED HIM,

425
00:30:06,770 --> 00:30:07,810
PERMANENTLY.

426
00:30:08,930 --> 00:30:11,080
HE'S DEAD BECAUSE THE PLANE HE WAS FLYING ON

427
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:12,330
CRASHED IN THE PACIFIC.

428
00:30:16,510 --> 00:30:18,470
WELL,I GOT BAD NEWS FOR YOU,POPS,

429
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:20,470
'CAUSE I WAS ON THAT PLANE WITH YOUR SON,

430
00:30:22,110 --> 00:30:23,710
AND HE SURE AS HELL WASN'T CRIPPLED.

431
00:30:24,340 --> 00:30:25,810
AND WE DIDN'T CRASH IN THE PACIFIC.

432
00:30:25,830 --> 00:30:29,140
WE CRASHED HERE ON THIS ISLAND. YOU SURE IT'S AN ISLAND?

433
00:30:29,910 --> 00:30:31,240
WELL,WHAT ELSE IS IT?

434
00:30:31,260 --> 00:30:33,180
LITTLE HOT FOR HEAVEN, ISN'T IT?

435
00:30:36,020 --> 00:30:38,790
OH,OKAY,SO WE'RE DEAD.

436
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:41,760
THEY FOUND YOUR PLANE ON THE BOTTOM OF THE OCEAN.

437
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:45,450
ONE MINUTE I'M IN A CAR WRECK, AND THE NEXT MINUTE

438
00:30:45,470 --> 00:30:47,420
I'M IN A PIRATE SHIP IN THE MIDDLE OF THE JUNGLE?

439
00:30:47,430 --> 00:30:49,510
IF TS ISN'T HELL, FRIEND...

440
00:30:50,890 --> 00:30:52,290
THEN WHERE ARE WE?

441
00:30:58,590 --> 00:31:00,350
WHY DID YOU THROW LOCKE OUT A WINDOW?

442
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:02,440
HE WAS BECOMING A NUISANCE.

443
00:31:05,130 --> 00:31:07,470
I CONNED HIM INTO GIVING ME ONE OF HIS KIDNEYS.

444
00:31:07,910 --> 00:31:09,120
HE NEVER GOT OVER IT.

445
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:12,490
CONNED?

446
00:31:13,350 --> 00:31:14,550
YES,SIR.

447
00:31:15,090 --> 00:31:16,070
CONNED.

448
00:31:23,310 --> 00:31:24,250
WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

449
00:31:24,910 --> 00:31:26,580
HMM? YOUR NAME?

450
00:31:27,340 --> 00:31:29,880
A CON MAN GOES BY MANY NAMES,FRIEND.

451
00:31:30,730 --> 00:31:34,800
I'VE BEEN ALAN SEWARD, ANTHONY COOPER,TED MacLAREN,

452
00:31:35,310 --> 00:31:38,300
TOM SAWYER, LOUIS JACKSON,PAUL--

453
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:39,180
TOM SAWYER?

454
00:31:40,750 --> 00:31:42,700
I WAS YOUNG, AND "HUCK FINN" WAS TAKEN...

455
00:31:43,790 --> 00:31:45,980
AND THE LADS LOVED THAT ONE.

456
00:31:46,540 --> 00:31:47,650
MADE ME CHARMING.

457
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:53,880
WELL,HOW ABOUT THAT?

458
00:31:56,470 --> 00:31:57,610
HOW ABOUT WHAT?

459
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:02,750
????

460
00:32:25,130 --> 00:32:27,150
BEN,WHAT'S ING ON?

461
00:32:28,170 --> 00:32:30,840
WE'RE MOVING. MOVING? WHERE ARE WE GOING?

462
00:32:30,860 --> 00:32:32,420
<i>WE</i> ARE NOT GOING ANYWHERE,JOHN.

463
00:32:33,090 --> 00:32:34,750
YOU ARE GOING TO STAY BEHIND.

464
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:37,100
YOU <i>BOTH</i> ARE GOING TO STAY BEHIND.

465
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,020
WHAT? YOU'RE NOT TAKING HIM?

466
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:43,190
HE'S YOUR MESS,JOHN. WHY WOULD WE CLEAN HIM UP?

467
00:32:43,210 --> 00:32:45,550
BEN,IF YOU'RE TRYING TO PUT ME IN MY PLACE,OR EMBARRASS ME--

468
00:32:45,570 --> 00:32:47,680
WHERE WOULD YOU GET A RIDICULOUS IDEA LIKE THAT?

469
00:32:49,250 --> 00:32:50,430
WELL,YOU CAN'T LEAVE ME.

470
00:32:50,830 --> 00:32:51,550
AFTER EVERYTHING, YOU CAN'T JUST--

471
00:32:51,570 --> 00:32:53,840
DON'T TELL ME WHAT I CAN'T DO,JOHN.

472
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:59,750
BUT I THOUGHT I WAS... SPECIAL.

473
00:33:02,730 --> 00:33:04,460
WELL, EVERYONE MAKES MISTAKES.

474
00:33:08,510 --> 00:33:09,550
WE'RE LEAVING NOW.

475
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:13,210
WE'LL LEAVE A TRAIL-- ONE YOU CAN TRACK. AND,JOHN,

476
00:33:14,910 --> 00:33:17,650
UNLESS YOU'RE CARRYING YOUR FATHER'S BODY ON YOUR BACK,

477
00:33:18,970 --> 00:33:19,910
DON'T BOTHER.

478
00:33:53,290 --> 00:33:54,630
WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOU?

479
00:33:56,700 --> 00:33:58,620
YOU EVER BEEN TO JASPER,ALABAMA?

480
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:02,020
WHY?

481
00:34:02,810 --> 00:34:04,180
HAVE YOU,OR HAVEN'T YOU?

482
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:07,880
YEAH,I'VE BEEN TO JASPER.

483
00:34:08,900 --> 00:34:10,860
DON'T TELL ME I'M YOUR DADDY.

484
00:34:12,340 --> 00:34:13,190
NO.

485
00:34:15,350 --> 00:34:16,720
YOU <i>KILLED</i> MY DADDY.

486
00:34:38,250 --> 00:34:39,070
READ IT.

487
00:34:46,730 --> 00:34:48,490
"DEAR MR. SAWYER..."

488
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:53,450
WHAT IS THIS? JUST READ IT.

489
00:34:56,750 --> 00:34:58,410
"YOU DON'T KNOW WHO I AM,

490
00:34:59,170 --> 00:35:00,830
"BUT I KNOW WHO YOU ARE,

491
00:35:02,210 --> 00:35:03,580
"AND I KNOW WHAT YOU DONE.

492
00:35:04,900 --> 00:35:06,700
"YOU HAD SEX WITH MY MOTHER

493
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:10,550
"AND THEN YOU STOLE MY DAD'S MONEY ALL AWAY,

494
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:14,340
SO HE GOT ANGRY, AND HE KILLED MY MOTHER..."

495
00:35:15,950 --> 00:35:17,810
"AND THEN HE KILLED HIMSELF..."

496
00:35:19,750 --> 00:35:21,030
BLAH,BLAH,BLAH,BLAH.

497
00:35:23,740 --> 00:35:24,650
SO WHAT?

498
00:35:25,710 --> 00:35:28,120
IS THIS SUPPOSED TO BE YOU? YOU WROTE THIS LETTER?

499
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:31,230
HEY,WAIT A SECOND.

500
00:35:32,180 --> 00:35:33,620
DID YOU TAKE <i>MY</i> NAME

501
00:35:33,630 --> 00:35:36,300
BECAUSE YOU WERE ON SOME KIND OF REVENGE KICK?

502
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:39,020
EEP READING.

503
00:35:39,030 --> 00:35:40,270
EASY,EASY.

504
00:35:41,010 --> 00:35:42,610
DON'T GET ALL WORKED UP.

505
00:35:43,410 --> 00:35:47,240
LOOK,I RAN THAT CON TWO DOZEN TIMES.

506
00:35:47,910 --> 00:35:48,960
IF YOUR MOTHER WAS ONE OF THE--

507
00:35:48,970 --> 00:35:49,950
MARY.

508
00:35:52,660 --> 00:35:53,960
HER NAME WAS MARY.

509
00:35:57,710 --> 00:35:59,870
MARY FROM JASPER,ALABAMA.

510
00:36:01,230 --> 00:36:03,890
YEAH,I REMEMBER HER.

511
00:36:05,150 --> 00:36:08,830
SHE PRACTICALLY BEGGED ME TO TAKE HER $38,000

512
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:11,690
AND TO RESCUE HER FROM HER SORRY LITTLE LIFE.

513
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:15,120
YOU FINISH THE LETTER.

514
00:36:15,430 --> 00:36:17,370
LOOK, I ONLY TOOK HER MONEY.

515
00:36:17,780 --> 00:36:20,210
IT AIN'T MY FAULT YOUR DAD OVERREACTED.

516
00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:22,650
IF HE PULLED THE OLD MURDER-SUICIDE,

517
00:36:22,660 --> 00:36:24,210
THEN I'M SURE HE'S DOWN HERE SOMEWHERE.

518
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:27,500
MAYBE YOU COULD TAKE THIS UP WITH HIM. 
FINISH IT!

519
00:36:30,940 --> 00:36:31,620
OKAY.

520
00:36:33,970 --> 00:36:35,020
OKAY.

521
00:36:46,410 --> 00:36:47,260
YOU WANNA GO TO HELL?

522
00:36:48,530 --> 00:36:49,780

525
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:49,520

IN PRIVATE. NO PROBLEM.

530
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:04,030

YEAH,YOU KNOW WHAT? YOU <i>SHOULD</i> STAY.

534
00:38:12,950 --> 00:38:14,940
SEEMS ONLY FAIR,CONSIDERING THAT SHE'S THE REASON

535
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:16,640
NO ONE WANTS TO TELL YOU THAT THERE'S A WOMAN

536

IN HURLEY'S TENT WHO PARACHUTED ONTO THE ISLAND YESTERDAY.

538
00:38:23,610 --> 00:38:24,820

539
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:27,460
IS ABOUT 80 MILES OFF THE COAST AND THAT IF SHE CAN FIND A WAY

TO CONTACT IT, WE'LL ALL BE RESCUED. WHY DIDN'T ANYONE TELL ME THIS?

541
00:38:33,030 --> 00:38:35,920
I ALREADY TOLD YOU-- BECAUSE THEY DON'T TRUST YOU.

542
00:38:44,530 --> 00:38:45,190
HOW?

543
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:47,480

544
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:49,200

545
00:38:49,220 --> 00:38:50,500

553
00:39:47,050 --> 00:39:48,360
WHY DID YOU DO THIS?

554
00:39:50,540 --> 00:39:51,760
HE RUINED MY LIFE,

555
00:39:52,590 --> 00:39:53,810
AND HE RUINED YOURS.

556
00:39:58,120 --> 00:39:59,230
AND HE HAD IT COMING.

557
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:05,580
JULIET IS A MOLE.

558
00:40:06,450 --> 00:40:09,570

SHE'S WORKING FOR BEN. HE SENT HER BACK

559
00:40:09,580 --> 00:40:11,390
TO FIND OUT WHICH OF OUR WOMEN WERE PREGNANT.

560
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:13,610
THREE DAYS FROM NOW,THERE'S GONNA BE A RAID ON THE BEACH,

561
00:40:13,610 --> 00:40:14,630
AND THEY'RE GONNA TAKE THEM.

562
00:40:15,370 --> 00:40:17,440
THEY <i>SAY</i> THEY DON'T WANT ANYONE TO GET HURT.

563
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:20,760
WELL, WHY ARE YOU TELLING ME?

564
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:24,120
SO YOU CAN WARN THE CAMP. 
YOU WARN THE CAMP.

565
00:40:25,850 --> 00:40:26,870
I'M NOT GOING BACK.

566
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:29,580
YOU'RE GOING BACK UNDERCOVER?

567
00:40:31,100 --> 00:40:33,040
NO,I WAS NEVER UNDERCOVER, JAMES.

568
00:40:34,370 --> 00:40:35,910
I'M ON MY OWN JOURNEY NOW.

569
00:40:38,810 --> 00:40:41,250
EVEN IF JULIET IS A MOLE, THEY AIN'T GONNA BELIEVE ME.

570
00:40:41,260 --> 00:40:42,970
I BEEN SAYING THAT SINCE SHE SHOWED UP.

571
00:40:45,980 --> 00:40:47,070
THEY'LL BELIEVE YOU NOW.

572
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:53,260
HEY.

573
00:40:55,830 --> 00:40:56,810
IS IT TRUE?

574
00:40:58,730 --> 00:40:59,680
IS WHAT TRUE?

575
00:41:00,420 --> 00:41:01,900
THAT HE THREW YOU OUT A WINDOW...

576
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:06,720

577
00:41:10,790 --> 00:41:11,720
