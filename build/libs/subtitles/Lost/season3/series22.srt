Lost Season 03 Episode 23

2
00:00:07,970 --> 00:00:09,050
You okay?

3
00:00:11,090 --> 00:00:12,570
Yeah, I just...

4
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:14,260
got a rock in my shoe.

5
00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:25,830
He didnt mean it, you know.

6
00:00:28,010 --> 00:00:30,570
- What?
- Sawyer.

7
00:00:31,180 --> 00:00:33,780
When he said that he didn't want you to go with him...
he didn't mean it.

8
00:00:34,490 --> 00:00:36,470
If he didn't mean it, why'd he say it?

9
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:39,710
He was trying to protect you.

10
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:45,600
That's why I asked you not to come back for me.

11
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:51,960
Hey.

12
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:55,860
Why are you sticking up for Sawyer?

13
00:00:56,170 --> 00:00:57,920
He'd never do it for you.

14
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:05,450
Because I love you.

15
00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:10,630
You've reached 310-555-0...

16
00:02:58,140 --> 00:02:59,410
can I help you?

17
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:01,320
Sorry. I, uh...

18
00:03:03,890 --> 00:03:06,270
actually, I came, uh...

19
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:10,560
is the funeral over?

20
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:13,170
There was no funeral, Sir.
Only a viewing.

21
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,420
Nobody showed up.

22
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:19,680
Nobody? You sure?

23
00:03:19,730 --> 00:03:22,620
Just you. My deepest condolences.

24
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:24,840
Friend or family?

25
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:29,600
Neither.

26
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:32,380
Would you like me to open it up?

27
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:33,560
No.

28
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:35,550
No.

29
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:37,860
Take your time.

30
00:04:11,570 --> 00:04:12,730
Damn it.

31
00:04:37,490 --> 00:04:38,640
Danielle.

32
00:04:40,810 --> 00:04:42,300
How much further?

33
00:04:42,350 --> 00:04:43,830
About an hour.

34
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:48,200
The radio tower...
when was the last time you were there?

35
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:50,600
The day I recorded the message.

36
00:04:52,090 --> 00:04:55,620
I'll take you to the tower,
but I'm not leaving the island.

37
00:04:55,870 --> 00:04:56,640
What?

38
00:04:56,710 --> 00:04:58,680
There's no place for me back there.

39
00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:01,130
This is my home now.

40
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:23,830
Hello, Jack!

41
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:28,120
We need to talk.

42
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:43,140
What did Ben say?

43
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:44,180
Can we kill him?

44
00:05:44,810 --> 00:05:47,360
Is it possible to turn this equipment off?

45
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:49,080
What?

46
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:51,780
The equipment that's jamming the island...
can you turn it off?

47
00:05:51,850 --> 00:05:54,040
Sure. Ben gave us the code.

48
00:05:54,070 --> 00:05:55,460
You are the only ones who have it?

49
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,740
Yeah. Why?

50
00:05:57,970 --> 00:06:00,840
What would happen if the station were to be flooded?

51
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:01,880
Nothing.

52
00:06:01,930 --> 00:06:03,470
The casing for the equipment is waterproof.

53
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:04,750
It'll keep going forever.

54
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:06,080
Then why do you need to be here?

55
00:06:06,130 --> 00:06:07,900
Because Ben told us to.

56
00:06:07,990 --> 00:06:09,140
We were following orders.

57
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:10,470
And you never asked why?

58
00:06:10,510 --> 00:06:13,290
No, because I trust him,

59
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:15,210
and I trust Jacob,

60
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:17,660
and the minute I start questioning orders,
this whole thing...

61
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:20,340
everything that we're doing here... falls apart.

62
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:25,600
She makes an excellent point.

63
00:06:46,350 --> 00:06:47,440
No!

64
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:49,230
Please...

65
00:06:49,730 --> 00:06:51,050
I'm sorry, Bonnie.

66
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:53,080
I, too, am following orders.

67
00:06:54,810 --> 00:06:55,830
Hey!

68
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:06,840
No, Des! Des! Don't!

69
00:07:07,590 --> 00:07:08,920
We need her.

70
00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:33,980
Hi. I'm Benjamin.

71
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:35,350
I don't believe we've had the pleasure...

72
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:36,940
don't talk to him!

73
00:07:39,910 --> 00:07:41,370
What do you want?

74
00:07:41,470 --> 00:07:43,260
Just a moment of your time...

75
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:46,760
to talk, you and me, alone.

76
00:07:47,470 --> 00:07:48,760
For what?

77
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:50,540
Jack, you've just killed seven of my people.

78
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:53,110
The least you can give me is five minutes.

79
00:07:57,950 --> 00:07:58,920
Is he alone?

80
00:07:58,990 --> 00:08:01,430
There's only two sets of tracks... his and hers.

81
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:11,640
Five minutes.

82
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:34,570
I'm sorry, sir there are no more refills left on this prescription.

83
00:08:38,130 --> 00:08:40,460
Well, that... that's a mistake. I, uh...

84
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:41,980
I only refilled it twice.

85
00:08:42,010 --> 00:08:43,860
Could you check again?

86
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:46,800
I did check it again, Dr. Shephard,
and that was the third refill,

87
00:08:46,830 --> 00:08:48,630
so there's nothing I can do.

88
00:08:50,190 --> 00:08:52,670
Fine. I've got another prescription right here.

89
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:54,780
Hey, I know you.

90
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:57,830
- You're the hero.
- I'm not a hero.

91
00:08:57,860 --> 00:09:00,020
Yeah, we... we saw it on tv.

92
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,210
Hey, lady, what's wrong with you?

93
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:03,350
Just give this guy whatever he needs.
Do you know what he did?

94
00:09:03,410 --> 00:09:04,800
Here, just... here...

95
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:06,630
Oxycodone.

96
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:09,120
Dr. Shephard,
you can't write a prescription for yourself.

97
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:09,770
That's not me.

98
00:09:09,810 --> 00:09:11,610
That's Dr. Christian Shephard.

99
00:09:11,650 --> 00:09:12,860
I'm Dr. Jack Shephard.

100
00:09:12,890 --> 00:09:13,740
He's my father.

101
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:15,270
I'm gonna have to call your father's office to confirm...

102
00:09:15,310 --> 00:09:16,320
well, he's out of town right now.

103
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:17,890
Well, I'm sure somebody in the office

104
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:21,300
don't bother.

105
00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:37,940
Have a seat.

106
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:50,270
Not so long ago, Jack, I made a decision

107
00:09:50,310 --> 00:09:53,840
that took the lives of over 40 people in a single day.

108
00:09:56,890 --> 00:09:59,000
I'm telling you this because...

109
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:03,330
history is about to repeat itself right here, right now.

110
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:04,670
Let me guess. You've...

111
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:08,750
you've got us surrounded,
and if I don't do what you say, you're gonna...

112
00:10:09,070 --> 00:10:10,370
you're gonna kill all my people.

113
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:11,430
No, jack.

114
00:10:11,650 --> 00:10:12,700
You are.

115
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:17,920
And how am I gonna do that, ben?

116
00:10:17,990 --> 00:10:20,080
The woman you're traveling with...

117
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:23,820
the one who parachuted onto the island from a helicopter...

118
00:10:23,850 --> 00:10:26,330
she's not who she says she is.

119
00:10:27,570 --> 00:10:28,650
She's not, huh?

120
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,220
No, she's not.

121
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:32,880
Then who is she?

122
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:36,990
She's a representative of some people
who have been trying to find this island, Jack.

123
00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:41,900
She's one of the bad guys.

124
00:10:41,950 --> 00:10:43,460
Oh.

125
00:10:43,530 --> 00:10:45,250
I almost forgot. You're the...

126
00:10:46,070 --> 00:10:47,300
you're the good guys.

127
00:10:47,370 --> 00:10:48,780
Jack, listen to me.

128
00:10:48,910 --> 00:10:55,830
If you phone her boat,
every single living person on this island will be killed.

129
00:10:59,730 --> 00:11:01,800
So here's what has to happen.

130
00:11:02,070 --> 00:11:03,950
Get that device...

131
00:11:04,060 --> 00:11:06,070
the phone she carries with her...

132
00:11:06,590 --> 00:11:08,210
and give it to me.

133
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:09,710
I will turn around.

134
00:11:09,770 --> 00:11:11,580
We'll go back to my people.

135
00:11:11,770 --> 00:11:14,290
You will turn around, go back to your people.

136
00:11:15,270 --> 00:11:17,040
I'm not going anywhere.

137
00:11:25,890 --> 00:11:28,580
- May I have my walkie back?
- What?

138
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:30,270
There's something you need to hear.

139
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:32,610
Please?

140
00:11:41,530 --> 00:11:42,870
Thank you.

141
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:47,520
Tom, are you there?

142
00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:51,210
Yeah, I'm here.

143
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:54,700
Your plan killed seven of my people,

144
00:11:54,830 --> 00:11:57,830
but the ones that you failed to kill
are now holding your friends

145
00:11:57,880 --> 00:12:01,140
Jin, Sayid, Bernard... at gun point.

146
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:03,330
Jack, don't give him any... uhh! Stop!

147
00:12:03,380 --> 00:12:04,050
Leave him alone!

148
00:12:04,090 --> 00:12:05,680
I said shut up!

149
00:12:07,990 --> 00:12:10,990
And what's to stop me from snapping your neck...

150
00:12:11,010 --> 00:12:14,530
tom, unless you hear my voice in one minute,
shoot all three of them.

151
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:15,450
Got it.

152
00:12:16,450 --> 00:12:17,920
I said don't move!

153
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:24,530
Bring me the phone, Jack.

154
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:25,770
Don't negotiate!

155
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:30,730
40 seconds.

156
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:31,750
No.

157
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:34,440
I'm getting them all off the island... all of 'em!

158
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:36,010
Let me ask you something, Jack.

159
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:37,500
Why do you want to leave the island?

160
00:12:37,530 --> 00:12:40,060
What is it you so desperately wanna get back to?

161
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:42,480
You have no one.

162
00:12:42,670 --> 00:12:46,450
Your father's dead.
Your wife left you, moved on with another man.

163
00:12:46,710 --> 00:12:51,320
Can you just not wait to get back to the hospital,
get back to fixing things?

164
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:52,960
It's 20 seconds now.

165
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:56,580
- Just get me the phone, Jack.
- No.

166
00:12:56,620 --> 00:12:58,090
Ten seconds.

167
00:12:58,150 --> 00:12:59,350
- Bring me the phone.
- No.

168
00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:00,360
- I'm not bluffing.
- I won't do it!

169
00:13:00,390 --> 00:13:02,180
Five... four... three...

170
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:03,180
no.

171
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:16,390
I'm so sorry, Jack.

172
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:49,850
Tom, are you there?

173
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:53,600
Yeah, Jack, I hear you.

174
00:13:54,790 --> 00:13:57,670
I'm gonna lead my people up to the radio tower,

175
00:13:58,220 --> 00:14:00,340
and I'm gonna make a call,

176
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:03,960
and I'm gonna get 'em all rescued... every one of 'em.

177
00:14:05,090 --> 00:14:07,140
And then I'm gonna come find you...

178
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:10,490
and I'm gonna kill you.

179
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:21,190
What's the code?

180
00:14:21,230 --> 00:14:22,170
Go away.

181
00:14:22,230 --> 00:14:23,660
Bonnie, let's just get this over with, okay?

182
00:14:23,690 --> 00:14:24,730
What's the code?

183
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:25,850
She's not gonna tell you, brother.

184
00:14:25,890 --> 00:14:26,970
Yeah, she's gonna tell me.

185
00:14:27,020 --> 00:14:27,780
What makes you say that?

186
00:14:27,830 --> 00:14:30,380
'Cause you said it's my destiny to turn off that jammer.

187
00:14:30,510 --> 00:14:33,320
Okay, Bonnie, we're both gonna die down here, all right?

188
00:14:33,380 --> 00:14:34,900
Let's be perfectly honest.

189
00:14:34,910 --> 00:14:36,880
That one-eyed maniac just killed your friend.

190
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:38,260
He shot you in the back.

191
00:14:38,350 --> 00:14:42,150
It would appear that your glorious leader, Ben,
put him up to it.

192
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:44,950
Are you a sobbing idiot?

193
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:50,890
You have the opportunity to make Ben very, very angry.

194
00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:53,170
Why would you not take that?

195
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:01,160
- 5-4-5...
- what?

196
00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:02,850
- 8-7-7-
- is that a code?

197
00:15:02,910 --> 00:15:06,580
- 5-5-4-3-7...
- Wait. Start again, start again.

198
00:15:06,610 --> 00:15:07,910
- 6...
- start from the beginning. Bonnie.

199
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:10,640
- 1-1-3.
- Start again. Bonnie! Bonnie, start again.

200
00:15:10,670 --> 00:15:11,730
Bonnie! Bonnie!

201
00:15:11,770 --> 00:15:13,030
Wake up, wake up, wake up.

202
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:14,580
Start again. Start again.

203
00:15:14,630 --> 00:15:17,410
- Good vibrations.
- What?

204
00:15:18,210 --> 00:15:19,770
Beach boys.

205
00:15:20,370 --> 00:15:22,530
"Good vibrations."

206
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:25,900
On the keypad.

207
00:15:25,940 --> 00:15:27,240
The numbers...

208
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:30,440
they're notes.

209
00:15:33,630 --> 00:15:36,550
It was programmed by a musician.

210
00:16:01,510 --> 00:16:03,100
Tie him up.

211
00:16:03,610 --> 00:16:05,230
He's coming with us.

212
00:16:25,070 --> 00:16:26,520
What?

213
00:16:30,710 --> 00:16:32,260
Alex...

214
00:16:34,780 --> 00:16:36,840
this is your mother.

215
00:17:06,170 --> 00:17:08,410
Will you help me tie him up?

216
00:17:27,830 --> 00:17:29,700
What happened? What'd he say?

217
00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:31,390
It's not important right now.

218
00:17:31,450 --> 00:17:34,820
- Just get everybody together.
- Jack, your knules.

219
00:17:40,010 --> 00:17:41,130
Here.

220
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:49,480
What happened?

221
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:53,710
He killed them.

222
00:17:56,530 --> 00:17:58,230
Bernard...

223
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:01,020
Jin, Sayid... all three of them. He...

224
00:18:03,020 --> 00:18:04,750
he radio-d the beach.

225
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:07,750
And I let it happen.

226
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:13,840
I had to let it happen.

227
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,400
We can't tell Rose...

228
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:19,330
or Sun, not yet.

229
00:18:19,790 --> 00:18:24,480
We gotta keep moving.
I promised Sayid that we would keep moving.

230
00:18:26,050 --> 00:18:28,010
So why did you bring him back?

231
00:18:30,050 --> 00:18:32,130
Why didn't you just kill him?

232
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:34,710
Because I want him to see it.

233
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:39,100
I want him to experience the moment that we get off this island,

234
00:18:39,150 --> 00:18:41,010
and I want him to know...

235
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:44,050
that he failed.

236
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:51,160
And then I'll kill him.

237
00:18:54,940 --> 00:18:55,830
It was an order, Tom.

238
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:57,490
We had to follow it.

239
00:18:57,740 --> 00:18:59,990
Ben didn't know what the hell he's talking about.

240
00:19:00,020 --> 00:19:01,600
He's lost it.

241
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:03,440
I mean, look at what they did to us.

242
00:19:03,510 --> 00:19:06,130
Instead of putting three bullets in the damn sand,

243
00:19:06,170 --> 00:19:07,950
we should've killed them for real.

244
00:19:19,330 --> 00:19:21,720
All they got left is 3 guys and 4 guns.

245
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:25,200
And all we've got, James, are two people and no guns.

246
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:27,470
So we'll wait till night.

247
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:29,850
That isn't gonna change the fact that we're unarmed.

248
00:19:29,930 --> 00:19:32,250
If you wanna kill yourself, that's fine,
but before you go and try...

249
00:19:32,290 --> 00:19:33,660
shh-

250
00:19:36,810 --> 00:19:38,280
you hear that?

251
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:57,400
Ryan!

252
00:20:05,630 --> 00:20:07,270
Stay in the bus, hero.

253
00:20:37,610 --> 00:20:39,250
Stay right there, Tom.

254
00:20:46,150 --> 00:20:47,380
Okay.

255
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:50,160
I give up.

256
00:20:59,740 --> 00:21:02,170
That's for taking the kid off the raft.

257
00:21:08,050 --> 00:21:10,120
Dude, it was over. He surrendered.

258
00:21:12,030 --> 00:21:14,050
I didn't believe him.

259
00:21:56,950 --> 00:21:59,210
What are you doing, Dr. Shephard?

260
00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:01,410
I was just, uh...

261
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:03,960
I was just checking the, uh...

262
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:06,550
the Arlen's charts. Just wanted to...

263
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:08,210
wanted to see how the operation went.

264
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:12,040
I left three messages on your voice mail.
You didn't get them?

265
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:15,210
My phone's broken.

266
00:22:17,650 --> 00:22:20,030
Let's go to my office, Jack.

267
00:22:20,270 --> 00:22:24,250
- For what?
- We need to have a talk. Come on.

268
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:28,530
You know, I know that
you're... you're new around here,

269
00:22:28,540 --> 00:22:31,240
- So you don't know much about me-
- I know enough.

270
00:22:31,250 --> 00:22:35,340
- So let's just walk down to my office-
- if you got something to say to me, you can say it to me...

271
00:22:35,350 --> 00:22:37,700
right here.

272
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:42,310
Will you excuse us, please?

273
00:22:46,890 --> 00:22:50,860
Mrs. Arlen, the woman you saved,
woke up in recovery about two hours ago.

274
00:22:50,870 --> 00:22:56,510
She was in some pain but highly responsive
to the reflex tests and entirely lucid.

275
00:22:56,520 --> 00:23:00,550
Well, that's... that's great.

276
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:05,310
But then she described the series of
events that caused her accident.

277
00:23:06,250 --> 00:23:11,120
She says she was driving over the bridge
when she saw a man standing on top of the railing

278
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:14,320
about to jump off.

279
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:18,670
She was distracted and lost control of her car.

280
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:24,260
She ran into the median, rolled over
and was hit by the van behind her.

281
00:23:26,670 --> 00:23:29,540
So the obvious question here, Jack...

282
00:23:29,550 --> 00:23:32,810
is how did you get to that flaming car so fast?

283
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:37,210
What were you doing on that bridge?

284
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:47,030
Do you know how many years
I've worked at this hospital?

285
00:23:47,740 --> 00:23:52,000
Do you know... anything about me?

286
00:23:52,340 --> 00:23:55,080
Do you have any idea...

287
00:23:55,090 --> 00:23:57,430
what I've been through?

288
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:59,810
How much have you had to drink today, Jack?

289
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:02,250
Okay, I'll tell you what.

290
00:24:02,260 --> 00:24:05,250
You do this... you get my father down here.

291
00:24:05,260 --> 00:24:10,900
Get him down here right now,
and if I'm drunker than he is, you can fire me.

292
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:16,870
Don't you look at me like that.
Don't you... pity me.

293
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:20,390
- I'm trying to help you...
- you can't help me!

294
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:55,120
Attention, others. Come in, others.

295
00:24:55,130 --> 00:24:59,380
If you're listening to this, I want you
to know that we got you bastards,

296
00:24:59,390 --> 00:25:04,770
and unless the rest of you wanna be blown up,
you best stay away from our beach.

297
00:25:04,780 --> 00:25:06,520
Hurley?

298
00:25:07,130 --> 00:25:08,370
Jack?

299
00:25:08,380 --> 00:25:10,020
Where are you? What's going on?

300
00:25:10,030 --> 00:25:12,850
- Dude, I'm back at the beach.
- What?

301
00:25:12,860 --> 00:25:15,050
Yeah, I went back to help Juliet and Sawyer.

302
00:25:15,060 --> 00:25:17,840
I... I saved them.

303
00:25:17,850 --> 00:25:19,720
You're... they're okay?

304
00:25:19,730 --> 00:25:20,850
- Juliet..
- everyone's fine.

305
00:25:20,860 --> 00:25:26,720
Me, Sawyer, Juliet, Sayid, Jin, Bernard.

306
00:25:26,730 --> 00:25:29,570
- We're all...
- w-wait.

307
00:25:30,580 --> 00:25:33,670
Bernard and Jin and Sayid... they're with you?

308
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:36,560
Yeah, dude, I told you. I saved them all.

309
00:25:49,430 --> 00:25:52,090
Hey... stay where you are.
We're almost up to the tower.

310
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:53,660
- You'll be safer there.
- Yeah, I gotcha.

311
00:25:53,670 --> 00:25:57,260
We'll stay put until you,
like, you know, phone home.

312
00:25:59,610 --> 00:26:02,460
What about Charlie?
Did he make it back yet?

313
00:26:02,470 --> 00:26:05,880
Not yet, but they're probably
paddling home as we speak.

314
00:26:05,890 --> 00:26:08,840
Don't worry. I'm sure he's fine.

315
00:26:19,630 --> 00:26:21,200
Des...

316
00:26:21,210 --> 00:26:23,420
there's diving gear on those racks, yeah?

317
00:26:23,430 --> 00:26:24,860
Aye. It's plenty.

318
00:26:24,870 --> 00:26:26,930
Why don't you take care of that?
I'll tap out good vibrations.

319
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:28,940
All right, mate.

320
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:31,710
- Hey, Des.
- Aye?

321
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:34,720
You get any flashes?

322
00:26:34,730 --> 00:26:37,190
No. Nothin'.

323
00:26:38,390 --> 00:26:42,420
- I'll meet you back here, then.
- Aye.

324
00:27:32,820 --> 00:27:35,660
So much for fate.

325
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:47,760
<i>"Incoming Transmission"</i> ?

326
00:27:51,090 --> 00:27:54,530
Hello? Can you hear me?

327
00:27:54,540 --> 00:27:56,610
Yes! Yes, I can hear you.

328
00:27:56,620 --> 00:27:58,380
Who is this? Who am I speaking to?

329
00:27:58,390 --> 00:28:00,550
Charlie! Uh... oh, Charlie pace.

330
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:05,190
I'm a survivor of flight 8-1-5...
Oceanic, flight 8-1-5.

331
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:07,470
Uh, wh-where are you?

332
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:10,190
- We're on an island. We're alive.
- An island? Well, where?

333
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:13,080
- What's the location?
- I don't know. Who's this?

334
00:28:13,090 --> 00:28:16,110
This is Penelope... Penelope Widmore.

335
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:18,050
How did you get this frequency?

336
00:28:18,060 --> 00:28:20,690
Desmond!

337
00:28:20,970 --> 00:28:23,660
Desmond!

338
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:28,320
- Did you just say,"Desmond"?
- Yeah, he's here. He's with me.

339
00:28:28,330 --> 00:28:30,630
- Is he okay?
- He's brilliant.

340
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:32,680
- Hey, are you on the boat?
- What... what boat?

341
00:28:32,690 --> 00:28:35,280
Your boat... 80 miles offshore.

342
00:28:35,290 --> 00:28:38,780
- Uh, N-Naomi, the parachutist.
- Well, I'm not on a boat.

343
00:28:38,790 --> 00:28:42,360
Who... who's Naomi?

344
00:29:13,150 --> 00:29:15,240
<i>Can you hear me?</i>

345
00:29:15,250 --> 00:29:18,360
Penny! No!

346
00:29:38,830 --> 00:29:41,560
Charlie!

347
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:38,260
<i>"NOT PENNY'S BOAT"</i>

348
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:25,290
Hey, Aaron, it's okay, sweetie.

349
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:27,410
- What's the matter?
- I don't know.

350
00:31:27,420 --> 00:31:29,840
I think he's just a bit scared.

351
00:31:29,850 --> 00:31:35,920
- Hard to blame him.
- What is it?

352
00:31:35,930 --> 00:31:38,920
What's your boyfriend's name...
the rock star who swam down to the station?

353
00:31:38,930 --> 00:31:41,310
Charlie. Why?

354
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:46,540
Charlie just got us rescued.

355
00:31:49,140 --> 00:31:51,990
Jack! Jack, he did it!

356
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,670
Your friend bloody well did it.
- What?

357
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:56,910
The green light... it's on. The jamming stopped.

358
00:31:56,920 --> 00:32:00,010
- Use it, then.
- All right.

359
00:32:01,940 --> 00:32:04,330
4-4-2.

360
00:32:04,340 --> 00:32:07,940
<i>Il Est Dehors. II est dehorset
brennan pris les clefs.</i>

361
00:32:07,950 --> 00:32:10,010
What's this?

362
00:32:10,020 --> 00:32:13,010
It's Rousseau's message.
It's still blocking the signal.

363
00:32:13,020 --> 00:32:15,000
It doesn't matter. We're here.

364
00:32:15,010 --> 00:32:19,790
<i>Iteration 1-7-5-5...</i>

365
00:32:55,760 --> 00:33:02,300
<i>iteration 1-7-5-5-0-4-4-5.</i>

366
00:33:02,310 --> 00:33:06,010
<i>Il est dehors. II est dehors et
brennan pris les clefs.</i>

367
00:33:06,020 --> 00:33:08,560
<i>Veuillez nous aider. Ils sont morts.</i>

368
00:33:08,570 --> 00:33:12,760
<i>Ils sont tous morts. Aidez-nous. Ils sont morts.</i>

369
00:33:12,770 --> 00:33:13,660
<i>Iteration...</i>

370
00:33:13,670 --> 00:33:16,480
I recorded this16 years ago.

371
00:33:16,490 --> 00:33:19,550
Three days before you were born.

372
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:24,970
<i>Il est dehors. II est dehors et brennan
pris les clefs. Veuiez nous aider.</i>

373
00:33:24,980 --> 00:33:27,510
I guess we don't need it anymore.

374
00:33:27,780 --> 00:33:30,650
<i>Aidez-nous. Ils sont</i>

375
00:33:33,820 --> 00:33:36,470
All right. Do it.

376
00:33:42,830 --> 00:33:45,770
I can't get a signal in here.

377
00:34:02,190 --> 00:34:04,340
I'm getting something.

378
00:34:05,910 --> 00:34:07,630
It's gonna work. It's happening.

379
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:10,010
We're gonna get off of this island.

380
00:34:10,020 --> 00:34:12,860
We'll celebrate when we're home.

381
00:34:13,910 --> 00:34:15,940
Jack!

382
00:34:16,290 --> 00:34:21,090
I know you think you're saving your
people, but you need to stop this.

383
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:24,230
- It's a mistake.
- The mistake was listening to you.

384
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:26,230
This will be your last chance, Jack.

385
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:30,340
I'm telling you, making that
call is the beginning of the end.

386
00:34:30,350 --> 00:34:32,920
I've got it! I've got a signal!

387
00:34:33,750 --> 00:34:36,070
Jack, please! You don't knowwhat you're doing!

388
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:38,840
I know exactly what l'm doing.

389
00:34:54,530 --> 00:34:56,190
John!

390
00:34:56,690 --> 00:34:59,100
Step back, Jack.

391
00:35:06,810 --> 00:35:09,380
- What did you do?
- What I had to.

392
00:35:09,390 --> 00:35:11,830
Now step back.

393
00:35:17,310 --> 00:35:19,970
Stay away from the phone.

394
00:35:27,250 --> 00:35:30,420
- What are you doing, John?
- I don't want to shoot you.

395
00:35:30,430 --> 00:35:33,070
Do it, John! Shoot him!

396
00:35:40,610 --> 00:35:45,340
Please, put the phone down.

397
00:35:46,630 --> 00:35:51,360
No. You're done keeping me on this island.

398
00:35:56,050 --> 00:36:00,840
I will... kill you if I have to.

399
00:36:00,850 --> 00:36:02,000
Then do it, John.

400
00:36:02,010 --> 00:36:04,680
Jack.

401
00:36:18,810 --> 00:36:20,510
Jack.

402
00:36:23,550 --> 00:36:26,680
You're not supposed to do this.

403
00:36:30,230 --> 00:36:32,560
Minkowski.

404
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:36,610
Hello?

405
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:42,940
- Who is this?
- Who is this?

406
00:36:44,610 --> 00:36:47,320
My name's Jack Shephard. Are you...

407
00:36:47,330 --> 00:36:49,500
are you on the boat... the freighter?

408
00:36:49,510 --> 00:36:51,450
How'd you get this channel?

409
00:36:51,460 --> 00:36:55,380
Naomi. Naomi told us about your
search team, about the boat.

410
00:36:55,390 --> 00:36:57,320
Naomi? You found her?

411
00:36:57,330 --> 00:37:00,430
Where is she? Who are you?

412
00:37:00,810 --> 00:37:05,030
I'm one of the survivors of Oceanic flight 815.

413
00:37:05,740 --> 00:37:08,020
Can you get a fix on our location?

414
00:37:08,030 --> 00:37:11,190
Hell, yeah, we can. Sit tight.

415
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:14,530
We'll be right there.

416
00:38:09,190 --> 00:38:11,080
Hello?

417
00:38:12,010 --> 00:38:14,100
Hello?

418
00:38:15,570 --> 00:38:18,420
- It's me.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait.

419
00:38:18,430 --> 00:38:21,520
Don't... don't hang up, please.

420
00:38:23,230 --> 00:38:26,170
I know what you said. I just...

421
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:30,700
I just need to see you. Please.

422
00:38:32,570 --> 00:38:36,570
Yeah. Yeah, out at the airport.

423
00:38:37,700 --> 00:38:40,120
You know where.

424
00:38:42,300 --> 00:38:44,260
Thank you.

425
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:02,560
- Hey.
- Hey.

426
00:40:05,730 --> 00:40:08,160
Saw you on the news.

427
00:40:08,570 --> 00:40:11,790
Still pulling people out of burning wreckage, huh?

428
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:14,190
Old habits.

429
00:40:16,930 --> 00:40:19,980
- You look terrible.
- Yeah.

430
00:40:20,820 --> 00:40:23,140
Thanks.

431
00:40:24,650 --> 00:40:27,470
Why did you call me, Jack?

432
00:40:37,690 --> 00:40:42,470
I was hoping that you'd heard,
that maybe you'd go to the funeral.

433
00:40:45,270 --> 00:40:48,090
Why would i go to the funeral?

434
00:41:00,010 --> 00:41:03,920
- Been flying a lot.
- What?

435
00:41:03,930 --> 00:41:05,860
Yeah, the golden pass that they gave us.

436
00:41:05,870 --> 00:41:08,180
I... I've been using it.

437
00:41:08,190 --> 00:41:10,190
Every friday night, I...

438
00:41:11,540 --> 00:41:15,370
I fly from L.A. to Tokyo or...

439
00:41:15,890 --> 00:41:20,200
Singapore or... Sydney.

440
00:41:21,990 --> 00:41:25,150
And then I... I get off, and I...

441
00:41:25,160 --> 00:41:28,550
have a drink and then I fly home.

442
00:41:29,420 --> 00:41:31,380
Why?

443
00:41:33,850 --> 00:41:37,310
Because I want it to crash, Kate.

444
00:41:39,780 --> 00:41:43,990
I don't care about anybody else on board.

445
00:41:44,420 --> 00:41:47,110
Every little bump we hit or...

446
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:52,200
turbulence, I mean, like, I actually close my eyes,

447
00:41:52,610 --> 00:41:57,530
and I pray that I can get back...

448
00:42:04,680 --> 00:42:09,890
- this is not gonna change
- No, I'm sick... of lying.

449
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:15,800
We made a mistake.

450
00:42:20,810 --> 00:42:25,110
I have to go. He's gonna be wondering why I'm

451
00:42:31,620 --> 00:42:35,350
We... were not supposed to leave.

452
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:38,010
Yes, we were.

453
00:42:45,580 --> 00:42:48,230
Good-bye, Jack.

454
00:42:55,500 --> 00:42:58,080
We have to go back, Kate.

455
00:43:14,850 --> 00:43:17,980
We have to go back!
