1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,672
<i>Previously on Lost:</i>

2
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:05,957
Each one of us
was brought here for a reason.

3
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:08,508
- And who brought us here, John?
- The island.

4
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:11,119
It's destiny.

5
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:15,193
<i>You and your partner will observe a
psychological experiment in progress.</i>

6
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:18,750
<i>Your duty is to observe team members
in another station on the island.</i>

7
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:21,274
<i>These team members are not aware
that they are under surveillance,</i>

8
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:23,237
<i>or they are subjects
of an experiment.</i>

9
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:27,996
Every single second
of my pathetic little life

10
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:30,071
is as useless as that button!

11
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:32,758
As long as we push it,
we'll never be free!

12
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:36,992
If you're sure it's not real,
then stop pushing the button.

13
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:41,915
Well, I have, except, unfortunately,
someone else decided to start.

14
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:44,829
Tomorrow we're gonna
find out what happens

15
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:47,309
if that button doesn't get pushed.

16
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:55,629
John!

17
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:59,633
Who is he, Box Man?
The man out there pounding on the door.

18
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:02,154
His name is Mr Eko.

19
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:04,754
Why does Mr Eko carry a stick
covered in scripture?

20
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:05,955
Because he's a priest.

21
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:08,911
- We need to push the button.
- No, we don't.

22
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,911
It's all bloody real!
Push the button!

23
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,718
No!

24
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:15,712
- You've killed us all.
- No. I just saved us all.

25
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:23,792
<i>System failure.
System failure.</i>

26
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:31,159
I was wrong.

27
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:54,798
When did John get back?

28
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,274
And what's he doing?

29
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:07,835
Where's he been?
Where's everyone else?

30
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,751
Don't you think you should find out?

31
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:21,553
So you're gone for a whole day...
after a massive hatch detonation.

32
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:25,399
You don't call.
You don't write.

33
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:28,956
Sorry, am I interrupting something?

34
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:36,637
What? You... can't speak, John?

35
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:38,075
You're mute?

36
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:42,279
I am sorry about that.

37
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:44,438
So, where are Eko and Desmond?

38
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:48,069
Are they off being mute
and building structures as well?

39
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:51,188
I know. You can't speak.

40
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:55,479
You need to speak...
to me?

41
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:57,194
What do you wanna...

42
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:02,156
The sand?
You need to speak to the sand?

43
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:07,550
Trees. Yeah, I've heard they're
wonderful conversationalists.

44
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:08,914
Hey!

45
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:12,276
I don't understand.

46
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:14,555
Who do you need to speak to?

47
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:16,593
The... church?

48
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,718
The sky.

49
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:22,119
Island.

50
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,433
Island?

51
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:31,119
You need to speak to the island?

52
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:06,191
"I need your help. "

53
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:08,510
Since when do you need my help?

54
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,994
"I need you to stand guard. "

55
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:24,270
Yeah, so you can talk to the island.

56
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:27,198
Sounds dangerous.

57
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:31,034
Well, amusing as the "mute game"
invariably is,

58
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:34,312
you are aware, John, that
I detest you, aren't you?

59
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:39,359
You do remember
repeatedly punching me in the face

60
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:41,874
and accusing me of using heroin
when I was not?

61
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:47,755
What the sodding hell
is a "sweat lodge?"

62
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:22,549
- Where you headed?
- Eureka.

63
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:26,519
I can get you far as Bridgeville.

64
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:28,079
Come on. Hop in. Come on.

65
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:42,272
- My name's John.
- Eddie.

66
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,952
- Hi, Eddie.
- Hey.

67
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,869
- Nasty day to be hitching.
- That's for sure.

68
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:50,715
You don't mind my asking,
what's in Eureka?

69
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:53,837
I heard there was
some work there cutting timber.

70
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:55,672
Oh, is that what you do?

71
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:57,352
That might be what I do.

72
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:00,159
All I know is that I had to get out
of where I came from.

73
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:02,117
Mom's dead, Dad's a drunk.

74
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:10,676
Hey, look at that. The rain is passing.

75
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,354
What, did you rob a bank?

76
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,552
Afraid so.

77
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:29,194
Could I see your license
and registration, please?

78
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:31,714
- Was I speeding, Officer?
- Taillight's out.

79
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:36,829
Could you both please
step outta the vehicle?

80
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:44,754
What do you got back here?

81
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:47,279
Guns and groceries.

82
00:07:55,440 --> 00:08:00,036
The transaction logs and paperwork
is in the red notebook in that duffel.

83
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:07,279
So, are we free to go?

84
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:13,277
I could still take you in
for picking up a hitchhiker.

85
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,713
That's my uncle.

86
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:19,193
I called him and he picked me up.

87
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:27,670
Get outta here.

88
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:42,397
So, what is with all the guns... uncle?

89
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:50,398
Oh, I like the indoor fireplace.
That's very snazzy.

90
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:54,798
What's that?

91
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:58,872
You're not taking drugs,
are you, John?

92
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:03,554
I only ask because of the strict
zero tolerance policy you've enacted,

93
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:07,076
and I wouldn't want you to have to
start punching yourself in the face.

94
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:13,630
I get it.
You go in your little magic hut,

95
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:16,393
and I stand out here
in case you devolve into a monkey.

96
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:23,797
"Don't come in. " OK.

97
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:26,877
OK. I get it.

98
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:19,995
Hi, John.

99
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:23,518
It's good to see you again.

100
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:30,192
What's that, John?

101
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,431
You're sorry.

102
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:38,796
That's OK. But I was
the sacrifice the island demanded.

103
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:48,476
Don't worry. You'll speak
when you have something worth saying.

104
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:51,988
I'm here to help you
find your way again.

105
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:54,230
So you can bring the family
back together.

106
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:58,473
Come on.

107
00:10:58,560 --> 00:10:59,993
I wanna show you something.

108
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:10,754
John.

109
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:14,148
You're gonna need that.

110
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:34,350
John, someone in this airport's
in serious danger.

111
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:37,159
You're the only one
who can save them.

112
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:43,508
Not them. They'll be fine...
for a while.

113
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:53,799
I think Sayid's got it.

114
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:55,549
Next, please.

115
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:07,393
Not Hurley.

116
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:17,356
Forget it. He's helping himself.

117
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:46,036
There's nothing you can do for them.
Not yet.

118
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:47,872
You have to clean up your own mess.

119
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:09,838
Come up here, John.

120
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:24,518
Clean it up, John.

121
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:28,316
They've got him.
You don't have much time.

122
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:43,789
John!

123
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,788
What happened?

124
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:51,038
Are you all right?

125
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:07,913
What are you doing?

126
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:13,432
I'm going to save Mr Eko's life.

127
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:42,919
- Eko's cross.
- He was dragged this way.

128
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,150
Dragged?

129
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:47,231
- By what?
- By the polar bear.

130
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:50,949
Sawyer killed the polar bear.

131
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:52,951
He killed "a" polar bear.

132
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:20,676
What's that, John? Blood?

133
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:25,149
I'm gonna go on alone,
you go back to Claire.

134
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:30,637
- Well, I'll take my chances.
- You don't wanna go with me, Charlie.

135
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:34,156
Bad things happen to people
who hang around with me.

136
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:44,719
Hey, Bobby.

137
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:07,759
What's that?

138
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:10,195
That, Eddie, is our sweat lodge.

139
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:11,709
A what?

140
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:14,792
Anybody who wants
can go in there and light a fire

141
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:17,110
and get it nice and hot...
meditate.

142
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:18,838
Then what?

143
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:21,388
Then you figure out
what to do with your life...

144
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:26,110
...what direction to take. Go in and
figure out if you're a farmer or hunter.

145
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:30,308
So which are you, John?

146
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:38,198
- Hey, John.
- Hey, Mike, Jan, this is Eddie.

147
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:41,911
Looking for logging work, but
I convinced him to come have supper.

148
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,070
- Nice to meet you, Eddie.
- Nice to meet you.

149
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:46,913
Any friend of John's
is a friend of ours.

150
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,070
John's a very special guy.

151
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:51,837
Grab a spot.

152
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:54,755
So, you like Geronimo Jackson?

153
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:58,115
They're all right.
It's my dad's old shirt.

154
00:16:58,400 --> 00:16:59,879
Your dad has excellent taste.

155
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:02,469
Listen up, people.

156
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:06,838
John brought a guest to supper.

157
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:09,639
- Everyone, this is Eddie.
- Hey, Eddie.

158
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:11,312
Eddie, this is everyone.

159
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:15,952
- Nice to meet you.
- John, you wanna say some grace?

160
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:17,678
Yeah.

161
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:23,437
Thank you, Lord.

162
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:26,034
Thank you for the food and the friends.

163
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:28,878
And thanks for the rain today,

164
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:31,758
so that Adam'll stop grumbling
about the droughts.

165
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:37,030
And for me, thank you for helping me
stop being so angry.

166
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:40,869
And for... helping me...

167
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:43,110
...find a real family.

168
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:50,154
They're a hell of a lot better than the
one I used to have. So, let's eat. Amen.

169
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:52,993
- Amen.
- Let's dig in.

170
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:56,391
- Potatoes?
- Thank you.

171
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:58,519
Thank you.

172
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:25,833
- Is that the hatch?
- What's left of it.

173
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:28,716
What happened?

174
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:32,240
Looks like it imploded.

175
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:08,596
What's that?

176
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:11,148
It's an active kill.

177
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:13,754
Whatever was eating this
is gonna be back for more.

178
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:17,116
If you wanna say "polar bear,"
you can just say it.

179
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:21,715
All right. "Polar bear. "

180
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:29,119
Run!

181
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:05,394
Dude.

182
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:11,590
They kept Jack, Kate, and Sawyer,

183
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:15,559
and they sent me back to tell everyone
else that we can't ever go over there.

184
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:19,998
Oh, and that dude
we had in the hatch, Henry...

185
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:22,634
...he was there,
he's like their leader.

186
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:29,990
So... what do we do?

187
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:34,517
Do what they told you. Go back
to the camp and tell the others.

188
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:37,239
- You're not gonna do anything?
- I am doing something.

189
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:40,995
- Go back to the beach, Hugo.
- Wait. Where are you guys going?

190
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:44,277
The island told Locke
he has to save Eko.

191
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:48,558
- Save him from what?
- Well, apparently a bear's got him.

192
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:52,315
It just made an active kill.
You may wanna hustle.

193
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:58,599
Bear?

194
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:03,873
What bear?

195
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:15,357
What is that? More fur?

196
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:19,398
This way.

197
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:27,349
You know, when I used to get high,

198
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:29,590
I'd watch nature programs on the Beeb.

199
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:33,951
Polar bears are meant to be
quite clever. Very clever.

200
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:38,672
They're like the Einsteins
of the bear community.

201
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:06,197
- She likes you, man.
- Shut up.

202
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:07,918
- Yeah, she does.
- She does not.

203
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,230
- Yeah, she does.
- She's half my age, man.

204
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:12,072
- You'd be better off with her.
- No.

205
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:14,116
Lizzie's too granola for me.

206
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:18,318
What she really wants is a daddy,
like everyone else here.

207
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:22,234
- You should take advantage of that.
- That's not really funny, Eddie.

208
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:26,631
It was a joke. I'm sorry.

209
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:32,996
How come you never talk
about your dad?

210
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:36,280
Nothing worth talking about.

211
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:44,116
What's going on
in that greenhouse over there?

212
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:48,756
- They need a hand with that fertilizer.
- No. They're OK.

213
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:50,796
Come on. We got orchard duty.

214
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:02,314
- What's the big secret, John?
- Sorry?

215
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:05,354
The greenhouse.
What do you guys got in there?

216
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:08,957
Every time I go near it,
you and everyone else acts all weird.

217
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:10,951
You're a guest, things take time.

218
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:13,554
I've been here for six weeks.

219
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:15,517
I'm not blind, man.

220
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:18,592
Did you forget you had
a bag of guns when you brought me here?

221
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:22,434
Mike and Jan welcomed you here
with open arms. They feed you.

222
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:25,398
- They give you a place to stay.
- And Mike and Jan

223
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:29,155
fold their hands every night before chow
and talk about how we're family,

224
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:31,834
your family's got too many secrets.

225
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:35,630
Now, I see the fertilizer
going into that greenhouse.

226
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:38,359
I know what's going on...

227
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:39,555
...and I want in.

228
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:44,395
- In on what?
- Whatever you are trying to blow up.

229
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:52,318
What's so funny?

230
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:54,919
Nothing.

231
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:58,356
I'll talk to Mike and Jan.

232
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:08,837
You really think Eko's in there?

233
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:16,071
Let's hurry up, maybe the bear's
out finishing his lunch.

234
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:18,549
- You're not going in there, Charlie.
- What?

235
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,679
I'm gonna do this alone.

236
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:24,354
Don't tell me what I can't do!
If I want to go, I'll go.

237
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:25,589
- Why?
- What?

238
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:28,399
- Why do you wanna go in there?
- I don't need a reason!

239
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:32,675
- Then go back.
- You don't have a good reason, either!

240
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:36,309
I'm going in there
because I'm supposed to go in there.

241
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:43,436
If it all goes to plan, we probably
won't even see the bear, will we?

242
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:45,715
And hopefully he won't smell us.

243
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:51,717
Hairspray? Now, I hate to be the one
to point this out to you...

244
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:53,313
It's not for me.

245
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:44,673
Bear?

246
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:48,072
Is that you?

247
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:50,994
Who's there?

248
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:52,958
Are you alone, brother?

249
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:54,875
Yeah.

250
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:59,118
Dude! I'm not alone.

251
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:05,029
Beach camp's right over there.
Can you get me some clothes?

252
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:06,394
What happened to yours?

253
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:12,319
I woke up in the jungle like this.

254
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:16,110
So... like, the hatch...

255
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:19,759
...blew off your underwear?

256
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:24,232
Fine. You wanna discuss this in
great detail right now?

257
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:27,118
- Then, let's do it.
- No, that's OK. I got something here.

258
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:32,592
How do you feel about tie-dye?

259
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:30,918
Hey, Kim.

260
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,991
Hey, Mike and Jan in?

261
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:35,230
Yeah. They were looking for you.

262
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:38,632
Good, good. Good timing then?

263
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:42,519
Go on in.

264
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:47,032
- You got all the cash?
- In the bag.

265
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:49,031
- Which bag?
- The one with the money!

266
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:50,712
- What about bank records?
- Leave 'em.

267
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:54,156
- Should we sort what they can trace?
- There is no time, Mike.

268
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:55,719
What's going on?

269
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:57,392
What does it look like?

270
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:02,434
You screwed up, John.
You blew it big time.

271
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:09,072
What are you doing?

272
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:10,673
Are you leaving?

273
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:13,399
- Why?
- That is why, you idiot!

274
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:14,549
Your friend's a cop.

275
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:16,710
You know how much time
we'd get for this?

276
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:21,635
- Nice picture, fresh out of academy.
- He was hitchhiking.

277
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:24,678
- He told me he was going to Eureka.
- He was waiting for you!

278
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:28,719
He has been here for six weeks gathering
evidence because you brought him here!

279
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:32,236
- That's impossible.
- He played you for a sucker. It's over.

280
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:35,757
No. Wait.

281
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:38,350
Wait, no, wait, wait. Stop!

282
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:43,231
We don't know what he's told them.
He hasn't even been in here yet.

283
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:46,312
If he's gathering evidence
to make a case, it's not too late.

284
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:49,198
- Not too late for what?
- To protect all of us.

285
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:51,271
It's not too late to fix this.

286
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:53,153
I can fix this.

287
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:57,708
How are you gonna do that?

288
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:30,469
Eko.

289
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:33,308
John...

290
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:11,639
Is he OK?

291
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:13,392
Is he alive?
Is he all right?

292
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:16,358
- He's alive.
- Turn him over.

293
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:18,472
We gotta get outta here.

294
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:20,437
OK. Let's get him up.

295
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:31,878
So, when you say "turned a key,"
you mean like a "key" key?

296
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:33,837
It was a fail-safe key.

297
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:36,959
That seems kind of convenient.

298
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:38,155
I'm sorry?

299
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:42,756
If you had this magic key
the whole time, why didn't you use it?

300
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:45,673
- I didn't know what would happen.
- What did happen?

301
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:49,389
Well, the fail-safe key must've
detonated the electromagnetic anomaly,

302
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:51,391
made the hatch implode.

303
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:53,471
But you didn't implode.

304
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:56,034
No.

305
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,719
You're not gonna...
turn into The Hulk or something?

306
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:05,755
So, is that what made the blender
noise and the sky turn purple?

307
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:07,512
I'm afraid I missed that.

308
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:09,192
Right, you were fail-safing.

309
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:12,750
Well, FYI, the whole island vibrated.

310
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:16,389
Kate, Jack and Sawyer saw it before
they had bags pulled over their heads.

311
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:19,756
Don't worry.
Locke's gonna go after them.

312
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:22,274
- He said so in his speech.
- What?

313
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:25,832
What speech?

314
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:29,515
All he said was he was gonna
save Eko and kill bears.

315
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:32,996
Right.

316
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:34,593
Right, of course.

317
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:37,671
I'm sorry. I...

318
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:40,392
...I'm just a bit shook up.

319
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:54,311
I burned that bear pretty good.

320
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:56,914
I don't think
he's gonna be coming after us.

321
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:00,436
Now that we've survived
this suicide mission...

322
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:02,476
...do you wanna tell me
what you saw?

323
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:05,438
- What I saw?
- In your spirit tent.

324
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:09,112
I saw Boone.

325
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:11,949
Boone?

326
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,275
What did he have to say for himself?

327
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:18,237
Told me I had to clean up my own mess.

328
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:21,193
Well... dead as he may be,

329
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:23,239
I agree with Boone.

330
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:25,914
If you kept pressing that
button like Eko told you...

331
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:30,232
We wouldn't have had to save him, that's
what cleaning up your own mess means.

332
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:36,558
Spoken like someone who's had
many messes to clean.

333
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:50,799
- No deer?
- Nope.

334
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:55,954
You talk to Mike and Jan yet?

335
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:59,237
- Yeah, sure did.
- What did they say?

336
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:02,111
They said that I should

337
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:06,034
bring you by the greenhouse tonight
and that they would explain everything.

338
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:09,396
Cool. That's great.

339
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:14,198
What? You see something?

340
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:18,918
John.

341
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:29,435
- What are you doing?
- Did you know it would be me?

342
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,592
- What?
- In the truck.

343
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:34,956
Did you know it would be me driving?

344
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:36,189
Did they choose me?

345
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:39,714
"They"? I have no idea
what you're talking about.

346
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:41,199
I didn't load that one.

347
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:49,716
So just answer the question, Eddie.

348
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:54,037
Yeah. They chose you, John.

349
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:59,032
Why?

350
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:01,918
You hadn't been here long,
didn't have a criminal record,

351
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:05,390
and the psych profile
said you would be amenable for coercion.

352
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:12,238
- "Amenable for coercion"?
- Hey! Lower the gun, John.

353
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:15,948
OK? This isn't personal.

354
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:17,473
What's not personal?

355
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:25,275
Stop, stop.

356
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:29,239
I'm sorry, John, but you're not gonna
shoot me. You're not a murderer.

357
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:33,479
You're a good man.

358
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:34,959
You're a farmer.

359
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:37,672
Nope.

360
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:40,149
Not a farmer.

361
00:34:40,640 --> 00:34:42,517
I was a hunter.

362
00:34:44,160 --> 00:34:46,037
I'm a hunter.

363
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:48,710
I'm gonna walk away now, John.

364
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:16,672
You hear something?

365
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:20,876
- It sounds like a stream.
- Yeah.

366
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:23,829
Put him down.
Maybe we can get some water in him.

367
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:39,029
I'll go. You stay here.

368
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:58,351
I'm sorry.

369
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:01,796
Sorry I ever doubted you.

370
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:04,030
Sorry I...

371
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:06,554
...gave up on my faith in the island.

372
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:12,990
I messed up.

373
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:15,951
Now our people are captured and...

374
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:19,671
...if I'd just listened to you...

375
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:22,957
...if I'd just let you
keep pushing the button...

376
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:27,829
I could've gone with 'em,

377
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:29,751
protected 'em.

378
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:32,871
I could've saved 'em.

379
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:37,470
You can still protect them.

380
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:45,310
You can still save them.

381
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:53,958
I don't even know where they are.

382
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:56,031
You will find them.

383
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:03,679
After all, you are a hunter, John.

384
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:12,589
- You say something?
- He's awake. Eko?

385
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:33,237
Maybe we should just...
get him back, John.

386
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:37,159
Yeah.

387
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:42,398
- You all right?
- Yeah, just keep walking.

388
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:45,512
John? Charlie?

389
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:48,678
- What happened?
- We got him.

390
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:51,795
- Is he alive?
- We need Jack.

391
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:54,589
- Take him in.
- Jack's not coming back.

392
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:57,148
- They've got him.
- What are you talking about?

393
00:37:57,240 --> 00:38:00,073
- Jack's gone?
- I don't understand.

394
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:03,436
- When were you planning on telling us?
- What do you mean, who's "they?"

395
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:06,796
"They" are the Others.

396
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:08,916
And, yes, they've taken Jack.

397
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,560
And Kate and Sawyer.

398
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:14,871
- How? What happened?
- What about Sun, Jin and Sayid?

399
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:16,393
I don't know.

400
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:20,034
I'm gonna find our friends.

401
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:23,830
I don't know how yet, but I will.

402
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:26,557
We're gonna find them, all of them.

403
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:28,471
And then we're gonna bring them home.

404
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:35,192
But first, we gotta look after Mr Eko.
Paulo, Nikki, bring towels and water.

405
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:38,716
We gotta clean him up, bring all the
first aid supplies you can find.

406
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:50,837
Not a bad speech.

407
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:00,439
I just got hit with...

408
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:07,913
...d?j? vu.

409
00:39:12,120 --> 00:39:14,270
Well... when that wears off,

410
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:17,716
can you get bandages
from the kitchen?
