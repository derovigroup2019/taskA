00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,956
<i>Previously on Lost:</i>

2
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:04,992
Stop! I'll shoot.

3
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:06,559
No, you won't, Sun.

4
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:10,678
Jack, I need your help.

5
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:13,549
Those aren't hers.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,353
She's gone.

7
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:22,432
The plane was loaded with heroin.

8
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:28,600
- Where did you find this?
- I found it in the jungle.

9
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:30,432
Take me there.

10
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:42,356
Eko? Who's that?

11
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:44,871
He's my brother.

12
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:50,877
Forgive me. Forgive me.

13
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:08,199
Here. Eat.

14
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:11,477
It's OK, Yemi.

15
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:16,559
Eko.

16
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:29,715
All right, Eko. Go.

17
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:35,958
Did you hear me? Go!

18
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:38,031
Confess that you have stolen.

19
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,039
Yemi was hungry.

20
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:44,871
That is not an excuse.
You have sinned, Eko.

21
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:46,473
Hunger does not matter.

22
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:53,319
Now go.

23
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:55,277
Ask God for forgiveness.

24
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:18,273
Confess!

25
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:32,555
How long has he been like this?

26
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:33,959
Couple days now.

27
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,712
Eko?

28
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,028
Can you hear me?

29
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:46,358
What happened to him?

30
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:50,035
Before or after we saved him
from the polar bear cave?

31
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:53,032
Come on. Locke will want to know
you guys are back.

32
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:01,473
Stay alive, dude, OK?

33
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:14,070
What are you doing here?

34
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:16,310
I have come to give my confession.

35
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:20,559
- Hello, Eko.
- Hello, brother.

36
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:24,157
I have some merchandise
that I need to get out of the country.

37
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,229
You mean drugs.

38
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:28,278
You will make us priests.
We will fly the drugs out ourselves.

39
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:31,238
My signature does not
make you a priest, Eko.

40
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:33,117
You could never be a priest.

41
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:37,879
- No more! Stop! No more!
- Yemi!

42
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:42,272
Yemi! No!

43
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,038
Father?

44
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:56,672
Are you OK, Father?

45
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:01,755
Eko. Eko, wake up.

46
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:17,916
It is time to confess.

47
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:22,475
To be judged, brother.

48
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:28,351
I will be waiting.

49
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:31,476
You know where to find me.

50
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:36,911
You guys smell smoke?

51
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:41,598
- Get him clear!
- Eko! Help me!

52
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:47,275
- Pick him up.
- Eko. Come on.

53
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:50,636
- We got to get you out of here.
- Cover him with a blanket. Careful.

54
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:57,550
Lay him down. Lay him down.

55
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:01,789
You're OK. You're all right.

56
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:04,914
My brother.

57
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:10,916
- Brother.
- You're all right. It's OK.

58
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,718
- My brother.
- You're all right.

59
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,438
I'll be back.

60
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:17,432
Brother. Yemi. Yemi.

61
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,829
Charlie, is everyone OK?

62
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:22,480
- Yeah, we're good.
- Where's Eko?

63
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,790
Hurley and I pulled him out over...

64
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:29,676
He was right there.

65
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:31,868
Eko?

66
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:33,958
Eko?

67
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:11,119
Good evening, Jack.

68
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:14,395
Good evening, Ben.

69
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:16,835
I was hoping you
might join me for a walk.

70
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:19,715
What?

71
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,791
Well, you say that like...

72
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:25,998
...you won't throw a bag over my head
and drag me out of here if I say no.

73
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:28,352
Then don't say no.

74
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:32,071
Why don't you put this on.

75
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:39,552
I'll wait outside.

76
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:43,790
Does it hurt?

77
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:46,997
Sorry?

78
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,311
Your neck. Does it hurt?

79
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:55,590
Any numbness in your fingers and toes?

80
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:59,593
Like pins and needles when
your foot falls asleep, but permanent?

81
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:05,913
Why are you asking me
these questions, Jack?

82
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,718
Because, Ben...

83
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:11,509
...you have a tumour on your spine.
An aggressive tumour...

84
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:13,556
...that is going to kill you.

85
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:19,070
I don't know when
those X-rays were taken,

86
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:21,549
but unless they were very recent...

87
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:26,711
...you're not gonna be
taking walks much longer.

88
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:30,275
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

89
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:33,432
OK. My mistake then.

90
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:39,078
I'm ready whenever you are.

91
00:07:57,880 --> 00:07:59,393
Stay here.

92
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:16,998
As we prepare to send
Colleen on her way,

93
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:20,038
- I'd like to take a moment to...
- I hate funerals.

94
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:23,271
He let you out?

95
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:26,992
Gave me a new shirt too.

96
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:33,757
Bye, Jack.

97
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:07,750
Why did you show him my X-rays?

98
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,471
I didn't tell him they were yours.

99
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:13,512
But I guess you did.

100
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:28,074
I think I know how to find
Jack, Kate and Sawyer.

101
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:31,918
Can I ask why he's being
included in the conversation?

102
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,877
Is that supposed to hurt my feelings?

103
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:35,951
Tell him what you told me.

104
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:39,874
The computer in the hatch
wasn't only for pushing the button.

105
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,880
Now I'm pretty sure

106
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:45,838
that it could be used
to communicate with other stations.

107
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:47,354
This is fascinating,

108
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,908
but you just told
me the hatch exploded.

109
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,831
One of them did.

110
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:55,359
You want to try and
communicate with The Others.

111
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:56,839
Yep.

112
00:09:57,320 --> 00:10:00,392
No luck, dudes. We looked everywhere.

113
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:01,913
Eko's gone.

114
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,228
There was no trail.

115
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:05,311
Not that we know
what a trail looks like.

116
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:07,709
When you pulled him out,
did he say anything?

117
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:10,553
Nothing coherent.
He was just mumbling.

118
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:12,631
"My brother, my brother. "

119
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:17,033
Sayid, pack your gear.
We're going to that computer.

120
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:20,279
- Wait, what about Eko?
- We'll catch up to him.

121
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:22,954
We're all going to the same place.

122
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:53,272
You are home, Father.

123
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:00,632
Father?

124
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:05,438
Oh, I was looking for Father Yemi.

125
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:13,231
Father Yemi is gone.

126
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:16,955
He was called away quite suddenly.

127
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:20,953
An emergency
at a refugee camp down south.

128
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:23,918
I am Amina. I work at the clinic.

129
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:27,555
This is my son, Daniel.
He's the altar boy here.

130
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:32,273
Are you taking his place?

131
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,155
Yes.

132
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:38,233
Will Father Yemi still go to London?

133
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:40,595
- London?
- He was leaving the end of the week.

134
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:43,235
He was going to continue his studies.

135
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:45,356
I will take his place there too.

136
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,750
Don't! No! Please!

137
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:37,239
No!

138
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,158
Confess.

139
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,231
We're heading out to the Pearl Station.
There's a computer there

140
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:06,313
that might help find our people.
Anybody want to come along?

141
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:08,789
What do you mean,
"Anybody want to come along?"

142
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:11,314
If you'd like to join us,
it's a free island.

143
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:15,559
Yeah, see, Jack would
go and do stuff alone...

144
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:19,238
...or he'd take Sayid or Kate.

145
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:22,471
Yeah, well... I'm not Jack.

146
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:26,710
- The more the merrier.
- I'll go!

147
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,438
- Great.
- What?

148
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:32,991
Anybody else wanna come, meet at the
tree line in ten minutes. Bring water.

149
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:35,036
You're not serious.

150
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:38,237
What? You always whine
about not being included.

151
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,958
Now's our chance.

152
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:47,789
Would you mind
if I ask you a question, brother?

153
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:51,634
- Shoot.
- Are we going to poke at a computer...

154
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:54,280
...or are we going after your man Eko?

155
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:56,676
Two birds, one stone.

156
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:02,474
Eko's heading for the plane that
crashed on top of the Pearl Station.

157
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:05,397
That's quite a coincidence.

158
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:09,509
Don't mistake coincidence for fate.

159
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:53,271
You're not supposed to do that.
That's holy water.

160
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,911
I'm washing away my sins.

161
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:58,868
- Father Yemi would never...
- I am not Father Yemi.

162
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:04,669
Wait there.

163
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:20,830
Where is Father Yemi?

164
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:22,314
Who wants to know?

165
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:34,034
Perhaps you did not hear me.
Where is Father Yemi?

166
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:35,792
The shipment is late.

167
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:37,359
I just got off the telephone.

168
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:40,159
- They assure me it will arrive Friday.
- What shipment?

169
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:43,671
You should explain our arrangement
to your new priest.

170
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:48,639
We receive shipments of vaccines
from the Red Cross. We keep 20 percent.

171
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:51,029
The rest we give to Emeka and his men.

172
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:53,031
In exchange for protection.

173
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:57,715
So you see, Father...

174
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:59,279
...everybody is happy.

175
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:02,952
Everybody's happy.

176
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:05,031
Everybody benefits.

177
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:09,479
So I hope you will continue
to honour our arrangements.

178
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:13,676
I am not afraid of you.

179
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:32,949
I'll be back for the vaccine
on Friday, Father.

180
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:36,590
You don't want more
lives on your conscience.

181
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,513
Hello, Eko.

182
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:54,437
You want to guess what's for lunch?

183
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,470
I'm not big on mysteries.

184
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:00,039
Of course you're not.

185
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:07,312
You people have cheeseburgers?

186
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:12,639
You have no idea what I went through
to make this for you.

187
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:14,915
I killed the cow.
Processed the meat.

188
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,912
Baked the bun. And the fries...

189
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:21,356
...try rendering animal fat.

190
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:24,791
No ketchup?

191
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:36,718
- I'd like to talk to him.
- OK. So talk to him.

192
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:39,553
- Alone, please.
- I'm fine with her being here.

193
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:42,950
And I'm thrilled that you're fine,
Jack, but it's private.

194
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:45,156
Doctor-patient confidentiality.

195
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:50,753
Sure.

196
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:53,358
Of course.

197
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:00,272
Mind if I eat?

198
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:09,998
We had such a wonderful plan
to break you, Jack.

199
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:14,789
Break me?

200
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:18,839
Wear you down until you were convinced
we weren't your enemies.

201
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:20,876
Get you to trust us.

202
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:25,474
And then, of course, we'd lead you
to believe that you were choosing to do

203
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:27,437
whatever we asked you to do.

204
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:31,433
All of this, of course,
assumed that you would get invested.

205
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:33,432
Invested in what?

206
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:38,318
Has it not occurred to you Juliet bears
a striking resemblance to your ex-wife?

207
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:46,952
Why are you telling me this?

208
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:51,318
I'm telling you this, Jack,
because my wonderful plan...

209
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:53,197
...got shot to sunshine

210
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:56,317
when you saw my damned X-rays
and figured out I was dying.

211
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:00,713
All of this...

212
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,151
...you brought me here
to operate on you. You...

213
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:07,915
You want me to save your life.

214
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:11,278
No. I want you to want to save my life.

215
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:15,718
But we're beyond that now, so...

216
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:21,469
All I can ask is that
you think about it.

217
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:35,397
Do you believe in God, Jack?

218
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:37,874
Do you?

219
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:43,032
Two days after I found out
I had a fatal tumour on my spine,

220
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:45,634
a spinal surgeon fell out of the sky.

221
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:51,713
And if that's not proof of God,

222
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:53,392
I don't know what is.

223
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:13,953
Hey. You sure you're all right?

224
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:17,918
We can stop for a bit
and catch our breaths.

225
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,359
I'm fine.

226
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:25,673
You're heading for
the plane wreckage, aren't you?

227
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:29,275
Charlie heard you call out for
your brother before you left the camp.

228
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:33,033
Is that what you're doing out here?
Looking for Yemi?

229
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:38,435
Do not speak my brother's name again.

230
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,231
What are you so afraid of, Eko?

231
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:50,516
You need to come back in two days.

232
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:53,433
Father, what can I do for you?

233
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:57,714
The vaccines that you spoke of,
how often do these shipments come?

234
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:00,633
Every six months, if we are lucky.

235
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:07,158
What makes you so interested
in our shipments of vaccine, Father?

236
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:12,154
You agree to give most of it
to the militia?

237
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:15,394
The vaccines fetch
a high price on the black markets.

238
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:20,437
Whatever you are thinking,
do not cross these men.

239
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:22,671
Before Father Yemi, we got nothing.

240
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:25,549
We owe whatever vaccines we have
to his work.

241
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,991
You remind me of him, you know.

242
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:32,638
You're a good man too.

243
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:54,870
I hear you have some vaccine to sell.

244
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:58,835
I do, but it has to be done by Sunday.
I'm leaving the country.

245
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:00,788
No problem.

246
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:15,356
The hatch is over here by the plane.
Why don't you take everybody down.

247
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:17,317
And you?

248
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:19,231
I'll be there in a minute.

249
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:25,829
- What's Eko looking for?
- His brother's body's in that plane.

250
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:52,871
So, what exactly did you see back there?

251
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:56,593
I saw it once, you know.

252
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:00,629
- And what did you see?
- I saw a very bright light.

253
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:04,719
It was beautiful.

254
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,070
That is not what I saw.

255
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:53,798
My brother's gone.

256
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:59,398
You set the plane on fire.

257
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:03,029
Yemi's body could've burned or...
not to mention animals or...

258
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:16,950
So you don't want to
come down there with us?

259
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:25,511
No. I will wait here.

260
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:27,269
Well...

261
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:31,197
Oh, I forgot.

262
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:34,149
I found this when I was looking for you.

263
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:21,471
Hello, Father.

264
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:26,079
I hear you have
a shipment of vaccine for sale.

265
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:30,159
If you thought you could do this
without me knowing...

266
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:32,233
...you don't know who I am.

267
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:39,078
You know... you're lucky, Father.

268
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:41,915
I'm a superstitious man.

269
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:45,039
I don't relish taking the life
of a holy man.

270
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:47,153
That is why, today...

271
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:51,150
...I'm only going
to cut off your hands.

272
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:08,199
No!

273
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:10,949
Please, no! No!

274
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:12,996
You do not know who I am.

275
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,399
<i>I'm Dr Mark Wickmund,</i>

276
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:55,031
<i>and this is the orientation film
for Station 5 of The Dharma Initiative.</i>

277
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:59,159
<i>Station 5, or The Pearl,
is a monitoring station</i>

278
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:03,199
<i>where the activities of participants
in Dharma Initiative projects</i>

279
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:05,430
<i>can be observed and recorded...</i>

280
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:08,637
- Well?
- The wiring is only one-way.

281
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:11,154
It's a closed system. A dead end.

282
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:12,559
Hey, guys?

283
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:15,629
What are these other TVs for?

284
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:19,235
- Sorry?
- All these TVs.

285
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:21,788
This guy says
that there's six stations.

286
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:23,916
Wait, here, check it out.

287
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:30,032
<i>...is a monitoring station</i>

288
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:33,954
<i>where the activities of participants
in Dharma Initiative projects</i>

289
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:36,076
<i>can be observed and recorded...</i>

290
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:38,355
"Projects. " More than one.

291
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:41,637
So maybe some of these TVs
are connected to the other hatches.

292
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:44,234
Well, I'm suddenly feeling very stupid.

293
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:46,629
Perhaps I could patch in
one of the other feeds,

294
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:48,517
see if we can get another picture.

295
00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:00,432
The toilet still works.

296
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:05,395
Anything yet?

297
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:09,713
Nothing.

298
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:12,472
What about now?

299
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:18,829
- John?
- Yeah, we got something.

300
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:20,355
Wow.

301
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:25,752
- What is it?
- That's a good question.

302
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:28,792
Those are computers.

303
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:29,915
Great.

304
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,718
That's what you're looking for.

305
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:33,870
Now we can get out of here.

306
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:51,191
I guess he'll be expecting us.

307
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:06,873
- You don't trust me anymore?
- I trust you just fine.

308
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:08,712
Just thought I'd put a movie in.

309
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:11,235
- I'll pass on the movie.
- You'll like this one.

310
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:13,754
<i>To Kill a Mockingbird.
It's a classic.</i>

311
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:17,150
- I don't want to watch a movie now.
- I'll turn the sound down then.

312
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:23,672
I felt like I should apologize,
say I'm sorry.

313
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:27,830
I'm sorry for bringing you here.

314
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:31,710
And for everything that's
been done to you and your friends.

315
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:34,393
You have to know...

316
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:36,839
...we were desperate.

317
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:39,952
It was all so we could save his life.

318
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:45,509
Ben.

319
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:49,232
He's a great man.

320
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:56,035
I know you find that
hard to believe, but he is.

321
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:02,908
You probably feel like...

322
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,150
...you don't have a choice...

323
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:07,356
...but you do, Jack.

324
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:11,994
Free will is all we've got.

325
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:23,117
Anyway, I just wanted
to put in my two cents.

326
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:32,750
I told you before you can trust me.

327
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:38,510
I want you to trust me...

328
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:43,351
...now when I tell you that
doing the surgery is absolutely

329
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:45,635
the right thing for you to do.

330
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:53,870
It's the right thing because
he deserves to live.

331
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:07,516
- Turn the movie off.
- Jack.

332
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:10,160
Turn it off! Now.

333
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:14,633
All right. It's off.

334
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:30,917
Think about what I said. Please.

335
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:46,791
- Where are you going?
- London.

336
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:49,155
Are you a bad man?

337
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:54,709
My mum says you're a bad man.

338
00:33:57,640 --> 00:33:59,631
Only God knows.

339
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:08,958
I see you have your vaccine.

340
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:11,315
Do you expect me to be grateful?

341
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:13,152
I know what you were planning to do.

342
00:34:13,640 --> 00:34:16,712
- Those men, I helped you...
- They will be replaced by others!

343
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:24,478
What are they doing?
What is the meaning of this?

344
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:27,588
We are boarding up the church.

345
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:29,874
We can no longer use it.

346
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,070
This is Yemi's church.

347
00:34:33,160 --> 00:34:36,470
- You have no right to do this.
- It is no longer sacred.

348
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:39,677
And one day you will be judged
for what you did.

349
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:42,718
If I were you,

350
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:44,916
I would start making my peace now.

351
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,434
I would go to London
and begin to repent

352
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:50,318
because you owe God
for every life you've taken.

353
00:34:51,680 --> 00:34:53,636
And you truly believe this is Yemi's?

354
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:58,711
You owe him one church.

355
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:21,517
Yemi.

356
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:23,959
Wait.

357
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:27,109
Yemi.

358
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:31,079
Yemi.

359
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:35,554
You say you want to hear my confession.

360
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:38,830
Why? Why now?

361
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:41,876
Show yourself. Where are you?

362
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:44,554
Where?

363
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:05,279
Are you ready, Eko?

364
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:10,879
Yes.

365
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:14,151
I am ready, Yemi.

366
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:31,636
I ask for no forgiveness, Father.

367
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:35,636
For I have not sinned.

368
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,468
I have only done
what I needed to do to survive.

369
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:48,036
A small boy once asked me

370
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:51,519
if I was a bad man.

371
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:54,191
If I could answer him now,

372
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:56,273
I would tell him

373
00:36:57,120 --> 00:36:59,953
that, when I was a young boy,

374
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:04,033
I killed a man
to save my brother's life.

375
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:10,354
I am not sorry for this.

376
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,195
I am proud of this.

377
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:24,638
I did not ask for
the life that I was given...

378
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:28,479
...but it was given, nonetheless.

379
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:31,997
And with it...

380
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:34,071
...I did my best.

381
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:43,479
You speak to me as if
I were your brother.

382
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:50,475
Who are you?

383
00:37:58,400 --> 00:37:59,549
Who are you?!

384
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:02,197
Who are you?!

385
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:10,392
Who are you?

386
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:33,230
The Lord is my shepherd.

387
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:35,038
I shall not want.

388
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:38,029
He leadeth me in paths
of righteousness...

389
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:09,478
Eko.

390
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:24,959
Oh, Eko.

391
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:31,835
It's OK. It's OK.

392
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,638
What did he say, John?

393
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:43,879
He said... we're next.
