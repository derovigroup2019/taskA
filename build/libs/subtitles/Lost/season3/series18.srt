Since he's been back...
he seems different.

129
00:08:26,437 --> 00:08:30,177
He says that he was pretty much a prisoner, and...

130
00:08:30,177 --> 00:08:32,560
the reason why he cooperated...

131
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:34,730
bcos he thought they would let him off the island.

132
00:08:34,730 --> 00:08:37,825
do you believe him ?

133
00:08:39,406 --> 00:08:41,427

134
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:46,800

- No, you'll just make it worse...

167
00:10:48,791 --> 00:10:51,493
Have you forgotten what's at stake here?.

168
00:10:51,643 --> 00:10:52,859
Or is this just another one of your flashes?
Who's getting an arrow in the neck this time?

00:11:08,046 --> 00:11:09,613
Hey,you're not leaving us.

175
00:11:09,767 --> 00:11:11,416

He's the guy who shot Sayid.

180
00:12:40,946 --> 00:12:44,132
Kate told us.
He lived out in that station that locke blew up.

181
00:12:44,721 --> 00:12:46,729

You've got five seconds to talk,or I fire this gun,brother.

184
00:12:55,756 --> 00:12:56,909
- That's a flare gun.

185
00:12:57,077 --> 00:13:01,541
- And how do you think it'll feel...
taking a flare to the chest at this range?

186
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:07,538
As your friend pointed out,
I already died once this week.

187
00:13:09,317 --> 00:13:12,795
<i>Estoy murriendo.</i>

188
00:13:14,255 --> 00:13:15,659
You understand her.

00:13:15,816 --> 00:13:19,993
She's speaking italian

190
00:13:21,963 --> 00:13:26,202
I was a soviet army field medic.
I can offer you my services.

00:13:26,869 --> 00:13:29,578
- Wait.What are you doing?
- I'm saving her.

192
00:13:37,884 --> 00:13:39,790
This branch has punctured her lung.

193
00:13:40,111 --> 00:13:41,739
It's filling with blood.

194
00:13:41,893 --> 00:13:44,720
If it is not ventilated soon,she's going to die.

195
00:13:48,266 --> 00:13:50,401
Well,do it.
Help her.

196
00:13:50,554 --> 00:13:55,048
If I fix her,you must let me walk away 
as if I never came upon you.

197
00:14:03,528 --> 00:14:05,881
What do you need??

198
00:14:57,862 --> 00:15:00,088

199
00:15:02,099 --> 00:15:03,309

200
00:15:06,582 --> 00:15:08,100

201
00:15:19,445 --> 00:15:21,294

202
00:15:24,950 --> 00:15:28,328

203
00:15:28,484 --> 00:15:30,200

204
00:15:30,744 --> 00:15:32,821

205
00:15:33,045 --> 00:15:36,532

206
00:15:38,346 --> 00:15:39,453

207
00:15:40,726 --> 00:15:43,478

208
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:47,157

209
00:15:49,153 --> 00:15:50,758

210
00:15:51,937 --> 00:15:53,849

211
00:15:58,338 --> 00:16:00,012

212
00:16:01,794 --> 00:16:06,421

213
00:16:11,375 --> 00:16:14,390

214
00:16:15,435 --> 00:16:18,390

215
00:16:28,193 --> 00:16:29,671

216
00:16:31,924 --> 00:16:34,239

217
00:16:36,361 --> 00:16:38,166

218
00:16:39,051 --> 00:16:40,986

219
00:16:42,359 --> 00:16:45,213

220
00:16:46,439 --> 00:16:50,973

221
00:17:05,134 --> 00:17:08,995

222
00:17:10,312 --> 00:17:14,301

223
00:17:17,373 --> 00:17:20,773

224
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:24,489
..

225
00:17:25,281 --> 00:17:26,635

226
00:17:26,833 --> 00:17:28,580

227
00:17:29,441 --> 00:17:30,952

228
00:17:32,147 --> 00:17:35,581

229
00:17:56,807 --> 00:17:58,216
be quiet.

230
00:17:58,383 --> 00:18:00,213
don't move

231
00:18:00,876 --> 00:18:02,743
You want me to help you and your baby?

232
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:04,282
I have answers to your questions,

233
00:18:04,454 --> 00:18:06,501
but you ha to come with me right now.

234
00:18:06,652 --> 00:18:09,397
Just you and me,nobody else

235
00:18:16,349 --> 00:18:18,296
if what you said was true

236
00:18:18,471 --> 00:18:20,360
,that means I'm already dead.,.

237
00:18:20,543 --> 00:18:22,084
Why should I go anywhere with you?

238
00:18:22,243 --> 00:18:24,525
Because there may be hope for you yet

239
00:18:49,369 --> 00:18:50,863
Where are we going?

240
00:18:51,334 --> 00:18:54,573
There's a medical station near here.
They have an ultrasound machine.

241
00:18:55,024 --> 00:18:57,619
Claire and Kate told me 
about that place.

242
00:18:58,511 --> 00:18:59,940
It was abandoned.

243
00:19:00,096 --> 00:19:01,298
They found nothing there.

244
00:19:01,462 --> 00:19:03,794
Well,that's because they didn't know where to look.

245
00:19:04,661 --> 00:19:06,301
What are you going to do to me?

246
00:19:10,407 --> 00:19:13,416
I'm gonna look at your baby and 
determine the D.O.C

247
00:19:14,119 --> 00:19:15,267
Um,date of conception.

260
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:19,010
The ultrasound will tell me when you got pregnant,give or take a day.

261
00:19:19,010 --> 00:19:23,560
If you got pregnant off the island,then you and your baby will probably be okay,

262
00:19:24,340 --> 00:19:26,430
but if you got pregnant here...

263
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:32,220
we'll cross that bridge when we come to it.

264
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:36,070
When was the last time you and your husband had sex?

265
00:19:36,370 --> 00:19:37,920
I would rather not talk about that.

266
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:41,310
Look,I know that it's personal,but if I know when,then I can figure--

267
00:19:41,310 --> 00:19:43,440
isn't that what the machine will do?

268
00:19:44,130 --> 00:19:45,470
Yeah.

269
00:19:46,490 --> 00:19:48,970
Then let's keep walking.

270
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:24,170

271
00:20:24,170 --> 00:20:25,650

272
00:20:25,650 --> 00:20:27,100
.

273
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:28,320

274
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:29,910

275
00:20:34,790 --> 00:20:37,010

276
00:20:40,370 --> 00:20:41,560

277
00:20:41,780 --> 00:20:44,000

278
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:49,860

279
00:20:54,250 --> 00:20:55,730

280
00:20:57,670 --> 00:20:58,750

281
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:01,080

282
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:05,270

283
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:11,250

284
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:14,310

285
00:21:14,830 --> 00:21:18,460

286
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:21,130

287
00:21:23,530 --> 00:21:25,450

288
00:21:26,470 --> 00:21:30,250

289
00:21:31,870 --> 00:21:33,230

290
00:21:34,940 --> 00:21:41,110

291
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:45,500

292
00:21:48,590 --> 00:21:50,330

293
00:22:18,530 --> 00:22:20,250

294
00:22:20,250 --> 00:22:22,520

295
00:22:23,530 --> 00:22:25,140

296
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:27,830

297
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:54,900
What else do you know about this woman?

298
00:22:54,980 --> 00:22:57,380
Did she have anything on her besides the flare gun?

299
00:22:57,450 --> 00:23:00,980
Just a book,a fancy radio-phone thingy...

300
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:04,160
does it work?

301
00:23:05,210 --> 00:23:07,050
Like I'd tell you.

302
00:23:07,930 --> 00:23:09,450
One of you must help.

303
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:12,040
The rest,clear the way.I need space.

304
00:23:12,250 --> 00:23:13,650
I'll do it.

305
00:23:15,620 --> 00:23:18,340
Wipe away as much of the blood as you can.

306
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:21,000
need to evacuate the air now!

307
00:23:21,740 --> 00:23:23,450
Hold her steady.

308
00:23:24,090 --> 00:23:24,940
Steady!

309
00:23:25,010 --> 00:23:26,370
Yeah,I-I heard you.

310
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:33,850
is that... normal?

311
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:41,770
gauze.

312
00:23:44,830 --> 00:23:47,780
Tape it. Be careful.

313
00:23:47,890 --> 00:23:49,610
The covering needs to be hollow.

314
00:23:50,250 --> 00:23:52,040
The wound needs to breathe.

315
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:01,190
what did she say?

316
00:24:01,910 --> 00:24:03,200
"Thank you."

317
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,800
She said,"thank you for helping me."

318
00:24:17,630 --> 00:24:19,640
It's right down here.

319
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:19,180
why are you doing this?

320
00:25:19,710 --> 00:25:21,210
What?

321
00:25:21,780 --> 00:25:23,750
Helping me.

322
00:25:33,510 --> 00:25:35,480
Once upon a time,

323
00:25:36,090 --> 00:25:39,640
I told women that they were pregnant,

324
00:25:40,020 --> 00:25:42,030
and their faces...

325
00:25:42,870 --> 00:25:49,060
it was the best news they ever got in their entire life.

326
00:25:50,470 --> 00:25:52,100
Then I came here.

327
00:25:55,180 --> 00:26:01,210
I've lost...nine patients...

328
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:03,480
in the last three years.

329
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:09,460
I'm helping you because I want to tell you

330
00:26:09,530 --> 00:26:13,750
that you and your husband got pregnant before you came here.

331
00:26:17,620 --> 00:26:21,100
I'm helping you because I want to give good news again.

332
00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:29,850
I slept with another man...

333
00:26:34,010 --> 00:26:36,390
Before we got to the island.

334
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:42,210
Jin and I,we were having...

335
00:26:44,450 --> 00:26:47,410
trouble.We weren't...

336
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,460
and I had a friend.

337
00:27:02,620 --> 00:27:04,480
It was a mistake.

338
00:27:04,630 --> 00:27:07,550
We all make mistakes.

339
00:27:11,580 --> 00:27:13,630
Which way?

340
00:27:47,650 --> 00:27:49,780
will you help me move this forward?

341
00:27:54,450 --> 00:27:55,900
good.

342
00:28:23,010 --> 00:28:25,820
why is this room hidden?

343
00:28:27,890 --> 00:28:29,670
Don't worry about it.

344
00:28:29,780 --> 00:28:31,680
What is this place?

345
00:28:33,740 --> 00:28:35,180
Tell me.

346
00:28:37,450 --> 00:28:40,590
It's where we brought the women to die.

347
00:28:45,450 --> 00:28:46,950
She's fine.

348
00:28:47,060 --> 00:28:49,690
Keep the wound as clean as you can.

349
00:28:50,340 --> 00:28:52,420
She should be better in a day.

350
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:54,000
A day?

351
00:28:54,110 --> 00:28:56,090
Her lung was punctured.

352
00:28:56,420 --> 00:28:59,750
On this island,the rules are a bit different.

353
00:29:00,210 --> 00:29:02,290
Maybe a day and a half.

354
00:29:06,770 --> 00:29:08,830
I did as I promised.

355
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:10,740
She will live.

356
00:29:11,010 --> 00:29:14,090
- You can't seriously be considering letting him go. - Just go.

357
00:29:16,110 --> 00:29:18,220
Are you kidding?He's one of them!

358
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:19,510
So what would you have me do,Charlie?

359
00:29:19,620 --> 00:29:21,380
We've t to make a stretcher and carry her.

360
00:29:21,490 --> 00:29:22,870
How are we gonna do that and bring a prisoner?

361
00:29:22,980 --> 00:29:25,570
- Give me some rope. 
- I'll take responsibility.

362
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:27,770
Phone. Phone!

363
00:29:28,150 --> 00:29:29,760
- Wait,jin! 
- Phone!

364
00:29:29,830 --> 00:29:31,550
- Jin,it's all right! 
-  no,let him!

365
00:29:31,620 --> 00:29:33,320
- Jin,come back here! 
- Oi,let him!

366
00:29:35,140 --> 00:29:37,190
- jin,it's all right! Jin! 
- Phone!

367
00:29:37,270 --> 00:29:38,530
Jin,let him go.

368
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:39,790
Jin,let him go!

369
00:29:40,090 --> 00:29:41,840
Phone!

370
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:50,580
You stole this?

371
00:29:50,690 --> 00:29:53,120
How could you respect me if I didn't try?

372
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:54,750
How about I take your other eye?

373
00:29:54,870 --> 00:29:56,670
Would you respect that?

374
00:29:56,790 --> 00:29:58,350
Sorry. I--

375
00:29:58,500 --> 00:30:00,200
Charlie,don't!

376
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:00,970
Charlie!

377
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:02,220
Charlie,let him go!

378
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:03,360
This is a mistake!

379
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:04,830
We can't keep letting these people go!

380
00:30:04,910 --> 00:30:06,430
We gave him our word!

381
00:30:16,140 --> 00:30:17,620
Go on.

382
00:30:18,250 --> 00:30:19,890
Get out of here.

383
00:30:42,140 --> 00:30:44,310
The baby isn't jin's.

384
00:30:47,860 --> 00:30:51,360
We tried to have a baby back in korea and couldn't.

385
00:30:51,780 --> 00:30:53,520
And the doctor...

386
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:59,010
he told me Jin was infertile.

387
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:01,520
And then you came here.

388
00:31:02,090 --> 00:31:03,480
What?

389
00:31:03,590 --> 00:31:08,800
Did you know that the average male 
sperm count is between

390
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:11,650
60 and 80 million?

391
00:31:12,410 --> 00:31:16,630
But on this island,
it's five times that.

392
00:31:16,780 --> 00:31:19,180
We call that good odds.

393
00:31:21,190 --> 00:31:22,710
you ready?

394
00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:25,480
Yes.

395
00:31:25,590 --> 00:31:28,040
Okay,you wanna lift up your shirt a little?

396
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:30,930
It's cold.

397
00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:35,490
will I see the baby?

398
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:36,520
Maybe.

399
00:31:36,660 --> 00:31:39,610
It's your first trimester,so it's a little iffy.

400
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:42,050
If you don't see a heartbeat,

401
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:45,010
don't worry about it.It's just early.

402
00:31:46,710 --> 00:31:48,490
How does it work?

403
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:50,920
Well,I take a measurement

404
00:31:51,030 --> 00:31:52,860
of the fetus,and that will tell us

405
00:31:52,940 --> 00:31:55,650
when your baby was conceived,

406
00:31:56,410 --> 00:31:58,430
and then we'll know who.

407
00:32:02,050 --> 00:32:04,030
are you okay?

408
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,510
I lose either way.

409
00:32:09,530 --> 00:32:11,810
If I'm going to live...

410
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:16,150
that means the baby's not jin's.

411
00:32:17,020 --> 00:32:19,190
Do you still want to do this?

412
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:25,540
- Yes.
- Okay.

413
00:32:25,730 --> 00:32:27,860
Moment of truth.

414
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:43,010

415
00:32:47,370 --> 00:32:49,170

416
00:32:55,370 --> 00:32:57,400

417
00:32:57,640 --> 00:32:59,930

418
00:33:00,780 --> 00:33:03,280

419
00:33:03,420 --> 00:33:06,170

420
00:33:07,590 --> 00:33:10,310

421
00:33:11,510 --> 00:33:13,240

422
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:15,210

423
00:33:15,260 --> 00:33:16,890

424
00:33:16,950 --> 00:33:19,050

425
00:33:22,180 --> 00:33:24,700

426
00:33:29,870 --> 00:33:32,240

427
00:33:32,900 --> 00:33:36,390

428
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:40,360

429
00:33:40,890 --> 00:33:43,900

430
00:33:44,140 --> 00:33:47,520

431
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:53,780

432
00:33:54,190 --> 00:33:59,760
.

433
00:33:59,780 --> 00:34:03,370

434
00:34:06,060 --> 00:34:10,190

435
00:34:12,370 --> 00:34:14,830

436
00:34:18,420 --> 00:34:21,090

437
00:34:21,290 --> 00:34:26,740

438
00:34:31,100 --> 00:34:33,660

439
00:34:34,570 --> 00:34:37,140

440
00:34:38,750 --> 00:34:41,830

441
00:34:42,030 --> 00:34:46,610

442
00:35:12,950 --> 00:35:14,980
There it is.

443
00:35:15,260 --> 00:35:18,770
There's your baby.Can you see?

444
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:24,570
I can see it.

445
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:28,350
is it a boy or a girl?

446
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:31,050
Oh,it's--it's a little early,

447
00:35:31,090 --> 00:35:35,880
but,um,do you see that little flutter?

448
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:40,040
that's the heart beating.

449
00:35:43,810 --> 00:35:47,370
it's very strong.It's very healthy.

450
00:35:51,630 --> 00:35:53,670
Okay.

451
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:57,870
you crashed here 90 days ago.

452
00:35:58,610 --> 00:36:02,070
The baby was conceived about eight weeks ago,

453
00:36:02,110 --> 00:36:05,820
so... around 53 days.

454
00:36:08,970 --> 00:36:12,250
you got pregnant on the island.

455
00:36:15,220 --> 00:36:19,120
I am sorry.I'm so sorry,sun.

456
00:36:19,150 --> 00:36:22,540
I will do everything that I can.

457
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:35,690
it's jin'S.

458
00:36:59,380 --> 00:37:01,790
I was starting to think you wouldn't come.

459
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:17,190
Why didn't you tell me you were Jin's mother?

460
00:37:19,260 --> 00:37:22,880
I gave birth to him.But hat doest not make me his mother.

461
00:37:24,570 --> 00:37:28,550
You know how powerful my family is.

462
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:35,980
My husband believes that you are dead.

463
00:37:36,090 --> 00:37:39,620
Do not force me to make that reality.

464
00:38:09,300 --> 00:38:12,100
so how long do I have?

465
00:38:13,460 --> 00:38:17,900
Most of the women made it into the 
middle of their second trimester.

466
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:23,150
Nobody made it to their third.

467
00:38:24,660 --> 00:38:27,770
That gives me two months.

468
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:39,110
I am...very happy the baby's jin'S.

469
00:38:40,100 --> 00:38:43,430
You gave me good news,juliet.

470
00:38:44,190 --> 00:38:47,060
It was my pleasure,sun.

471
00:38:48,820 --> 00:38:52,540
I'm gonna go back inside and 
make sure that I didn't miss anything.

472
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:56,820
I don't wanna take the chance 
that we didn't cover our tracks.

473
00:38:59,590 --> 00:39:02,640
Do you wanna wait out here?

474
00:39:02,670 --> 00:39:05,450
All right.

475
00:39:08,130 --> 00:39:10,750
Juliet?

476
00:39:12,190 --> 00:39:15,160
Thank you.

477
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:51,890
ben,it's 6:00 A.M.On saturday morning.

478
00:39:53,540 --> 00:39:54,710
Kwon is pregnant.

479
00:39:54,740 --> 00:39:58,720
The fetus is healthy and was conceived 
on island with her husband.

480
00:39:58,760 --> 00:40:01,120
He was sterile before they got here.

481
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:03,410
I'm still working on getting samples 
from the other women.

482
00:40:03,450 --> 00:40:05,540
I should have austen's soon.

483
00:40:05,570 --> 00:40:08,500
I'll report back when I know more.

484
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:17,790
I hate you.

485
00:40:24,050 --> 00:40:27,100
- You can't trust 'em,you know.
- What's that?

486
00:40:27,150 --> 00:40:30,390
The others--the one you let go.

487
00:40:30,430 --> 00:40:32,950
He'll be back tomorrow with five of his mates.

488
00:40:32,970 --> 00:40:35,290
Should've killed him.

489
00:40:35,350 --> 00:40:37,330
Charlie.Uh,tight.

490
00:40:37,350 --> 00:40:39,160
Oh,okay.

491
00:40:39,190 --> 00:40:41,020
You know,brother,

492
00:40:41,070 --> 00:40:43,410
by my count,

493
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:46,820
you've killed more of them than they've killed of you.

494
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:48,360
They started it.

495
00:40:48,390 --> 00:40:49,910
You know,just 'cause one comes traipsing back

496
00:40:49,970 --> 00:40:53,480
with Jack and Kate doesn't mean that we can trust them now.

497
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:16,010
Mom?

498
00:41:18,660 --> 00:41:20,790
where am I?

499
00:41:21,460 --> 00:41:23,080
Take it easy.You just had a giant branch in your--

500
00:41:23,110 --> 00:41:25,840
- where am I? - I don't know.

501
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:28,050
You're on an island.

502
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:29,730
Are you here to rescue us?

503
00:41:29,790 --> 00:41:32,500
Are there more of you?
Can you make your phone work?

504
00:41:32,540 --> 00:41:34,400
- Who are you?
- Hugo Reyes.

505
00:41:34,430 --> 00:41:37,120
I crashed here on oceanic flight 815.

506
00:41:37,150 --> 00:41:41,240
A bunch of us survived.Is that why you're here?
Were you looking for us?

507
00:41:41,900 --> 00:41:46,330
815? Flight 815?!

508
00:41:46,370 --> 00:41:49,200
- The one from sydney?
- Yeah!

509
00:41:49,550 --> 00:41:52,660
- No. That's not possible.
- Yeah,I know.

510
00:41:52,710 --> 00:41:55,480
- It wasn't easy,but we found food -
- no,no.

511
00:41:55,500 --> 00:41:58,150
- In the hatch,more food-
- no,flight 815--they...

512
00:41:58,180 --> 00:42:00,860
they found the plane.

513
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:05,390
There were no survivors.

514
00:42:07,410 --> 00:42:09,760
They were all dead.

515
00:42:13,640 --> 00:42:14,910
What?
