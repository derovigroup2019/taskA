00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,353
<i>Previously on Lost:</i>

2
00:00:02,440 --> 00:00:04,510
You want me to save your life?

3
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:06,591
I want you to want to save my life.

4
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:08,955
I made a small incision
in Ben's kidney sack.

5
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:12,237
Now, if I don't stitch that back up
in the next hour, he's dead.

6
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:15,995
I'd like for you to go back in there,
put Ben under and finish the surgery.

7
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:19,152
- Why would I do that?
- I'm going to help your friends escape.

8
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:23,628
- No!
- Danny!

9
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:49,950
- Stop.
- What, you want a turn steering?

10
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:53,599
- We have to go back.
- What are you talking about?

11
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:54,954
Turn the boat around.

12
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:57,838
- Have you lost your mind? We got away!
- Just do it.

13
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:01,754
- Give me one reason to turn around!
- Because we can't leave Jack behind.

14
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:10,839
Yes, we can, Freckles...
because that's what he asked us to do.

15
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:13,551
You think about it.
We go back there,

16
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:16,916
what do you think Captain Bunnykiller
is gonna do if he catches us?

17
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,036
Kill you.

18
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:23,390
God loves you as he loved Jacob.

19
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:29,789
OK. Thanks for the input.

20
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:33,592
Sorry, kiddo.

21
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:36,555
Jack's on his own.

22
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:41,678
Time to get up.

23
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:44,437
We're moving you.

24
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:49,114
- Moving me where?
- Someplace else, Jack.

25
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:51,593
Why?

26
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:59,435
- So this it?
- It?

27
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:03,271
You just helped me save his life.
If you're gonna kill me, please,

28
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:06,591
at least show me the respect
of not calling it "moving. "

29
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:08,877
Now why would we kill you?

30
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:11,439
Because you're done with me.

31
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,431
What kind of people
do you think we are?

32
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:14,919
Oh, I don't know, Tom...

33
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:18,753
...the kind of people
that would take a pregnant woman,

34
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:20,990
would hang Charlie from a tree,

35
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:23,391
would drag our people
out of the jungle,

36
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:25,471
would kidnap children.

37
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,870
That's the kind of people
I think you are.

38
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:42,512
You see this glass house
you're living in, Jack?

39
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:46,110
How about I get you some stones?

40
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,150
Let's do this the easy way.
What do you say?

41
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:17,959
Hey.

42
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:09,789
Dr Jack! Hey, Dr Jack!

43
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:13,239
Dr Jack want soda, Dr Jack?

44
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:29,834
You know I can't understand
a word you're saying?

45
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:31,235
Dr Jack.

46
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:35,149
You're welcome.

47
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:46,509
Thank you. Thank you very much.

48
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:48,911
You're not from around here, are you?

49
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:55,316
No. No, I'm not. I'm Jack.

50
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:58,870
Hi, Jack. I'm Achara.

51
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,749
Achara? Achara.

52
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:24,110
Juliet grilled these for me.

53
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:28,191
Who was that woman?

54
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:30,238
That'd be the sheriff.

55
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:33,037
- You have a sheriff?
- Not literally.

56
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:37,750
- Why're you moving Juliet into my room?
- Because she's in trouble, Jack.

57
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:45,637
Now don't try anything stupid.
You stay put in this cage, OK?

58
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:49,235
You say that like you're not watching me
from that camera right there.

59
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:53,553
Oh, right. Ben told me
you got into the... surveillance room.

60
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,519
Let me ask you something.

61
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:11,838
You risk your neck to cut them loose,
and they run away and don't look back...

62
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:13,433
Thanks for the sandwich.

63
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:25,394
Never thought I'd be glad
to get back to this rock.

64
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,352
What are you doing?

65
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:28,953
I'm heading in to shore.

66
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:31,395
Why? If we just keep going,
we can circle around.

67
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:34,278
We'll get to camp,
tell Locke and Sayid what happened...

68
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:37,557
Oh, we will? You got a map
you ain't showing me, Magella?

69
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:42,152
We got no food, no water,
and I can't steer in the dark.

70
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,719
Then I'll steer.

71
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,358
No.

72
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:48,079
You'll come ashore
and we'll make camp.

73
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:53,510
You wanna contribute? You can build
a camp fire while I carry the kid.

74
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:56,637
Glad we agree.

75
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:10,318
You sure you ain't hungry?

76
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,392
No, James. I ain't hungry.

77
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:15,958
You shouldn't fight.

78
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:18,916
When the hell did you wake up?

79
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:22,278
You shouldn't fight,
because you're lucky to be alive.

80
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:25,914
Golly! I think he's got a point.

81
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:31,559
That island we were on,
is that where your people live?

82
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:33,596
Just where we work.

83
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:36,790
- Work on what?
- Projects.

84
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:40,475
Oh, sure. Like the
Steal the Kid Off the Raft Project?

85
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:44,109
- That was a humdinger.
- So you don't live on that island?

86
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:46,873
- Nope.
- So you live here?

87
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:49,997
- On this island?
- Yes, ma'am.

88
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:57,993
And what did you do with the people
that you took... the kids?

89
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,355
- Give them a better life.
- Better than what?

90
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:04,151
Better than yours.

91
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:14,839
There's not gonna be
any moon tonight. It'll be dark.

92
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,908
Me and Alex used to lie
in my back yard at night

93
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,230
and make up names
for the constellations.

94
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:24,836
You can't see it yet, but right there
will be Ursa Theodorus.

95
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:27,993
The teddy bear.

96
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:30,640
- You have back yards?
- Yeah.

97
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:35,596
Well, ain't that quaint.

98
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,832
<i>Warning.</i>

99
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:47,668
<i>Warning.</i>

100
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:09,109
- I thought you were locked up.
- They let me out to examine Ben.

101
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,350
His vitals are low,
and he has a fever.

102
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:14,637
I took this about ten minutes ago.
It's of his stitches.

103
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:19,636
They're infected, aren't they?

104
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:22,351
- Yes.
- Will you come look at him?

105
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:24,709
- No.
- Jack...

106
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:28,110
- No.
- I'm not asking you for them or him.

107
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:31,272
I'm asking you as
a personal favour to me.

108
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:36,673
You want me to help him again?

109
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:40,396
- Yes.
- Are you sure about that, Juliet?

110
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:43,233
Yes. I'm sure.

111
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:46,710
And this is because he said
that he would let you go home?

112
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,279
No.

113
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:52,077
No.

114
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:56,429
It's because I'm in trouble.

115
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:58,637
- Trouble for...
- I killed someone.

116
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:01,188
It's why they put me in your room.

117
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:02,998
Who?

118
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:07,750
It's complicated.

119
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:11,993
Well, then let me simplify it for you.

120
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:14,556
I'm not gonna help him.

121
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:18,392
And I'm not gonna help you.

122
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:42,357
OK! Special Thai dish for you. You try.

123
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:57,629
Very brave, very brave.

124
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:04,515
- My brother likes you.
- Well, I'm a very likable guy.

125
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,633
So, Jack...

126
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:12,232
...tell me something.

127
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,118
Shoot.

128
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:17,078
Why is it you don't know
how to fly a kite?

129
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:21,956
- Just never learned, I guess.
- That's very sad.

130
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:23,871
Well, my dad worked a lot,

131
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:27,759
and he wasn't exactly
the kite-flying type, anyway.

132
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:29,796
- I mean, we never really...
- Jack?

133
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:33,839
- Yeah?
- I have no interest in your father.

134
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:37,310
Well, that's a relief because
I'm pretty tired of talking about him.

135
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:39,311
Some things are personal.

136
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:49,829
So you're in Phuket to find yourself?

137
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:53,994
- Why would you say that?
- You're an American.

138
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:16,111
I have a gift.

139
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:19,919
Must be one hell of a gift.

140
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:48,878
Oh, I was just reading your tattoos.

141
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:51,155
The five and the stars are very cute.

142
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:54,152
But the Chinese, I find a...

143
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:58,112
...bit ironic.

144
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:00,830
- You find what ironic?
- What it says.

145
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:05,634
You do know what it says?

146
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:11,113
- Yeah. I know what it says.
- Are you sure?

147
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:14,268
Chinese is a very
complicated language.

148
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:17,318
It's fairly common for things
to get lost in translation.

149
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:19,231
I know what it says.

150
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:22,838
All right then.

151
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,513
Jack?

152
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:29,879
My name is Isabel.

153
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:34,120
If you'll come with me,

154
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:36,873
I'd like to talk to you
and ask you a few questions.

155
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:53,349
Why don't you check on your father,
sweetheart? I know he'd appreciate it.

156
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:08,875
Please have a seat, Jack.

157
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:12,475
As you may have gathered,
we don't live on this little island.

158
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:15,677
In fact, most of us don't really
even like coming here.

159
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:18,390
There's an incident I'm investigating

160
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:20,311
and I need to ask you some questions.

161
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:24,678
So I was hoping you may help me
clear up a few of the...

162
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:27,595
...inconsistencies.

163
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:29,951
Now, correct me if I'm wrong, Tom,

164
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:32,838
but you said in the midst
of a surgical procedure,

165
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:38,153
Jack made several comments indicating
that Juliet had asked him to kill Ben.

166
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:44,512
- Yeah. That's right.
- Is that true, Jack?

167
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:46,875
Did Juliet ask you to kill Ben?

168
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:50,999
The question's simple.

169
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:53,878
Did Juliet ask you to kill Ben?

170
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:06,032
No. No, I was lying. I would've done
anything to get my friends out.

171
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:10,352
Turning you people against each other
was my best chance of creating chaos.

172
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:25,395
Why are you lying for her, Jack?

173
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:38,911
I'd like to go back to my cage now.

174
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:51,193
Who's there?

175
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:54,998
Who do you think?

176
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:07,636
What time is it?

177
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:09,874
It's late.

178
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:19,397
- Salty.
- I went for a swim in the ocean.

179
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:22,199
Washing the day off of you?

180
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:27,314
Is there something
you'd like to ask me, Jack?

181
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:29,197
No, not at all.

182
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,560
I mean, it might be nice,

183
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:36,113
after a month of you coming in
whenever you want,

184
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:38,671
to find out something about you.

185
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:47,550
There are things that happen here
that you could never understand.

186
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:58,078
Like your gift?

187
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:02,590
Yes... like my gift.

188
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,638
Are you having fun with me, Jack?

189
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:31,152
Oh, yeah.

190
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:35,391
Then stop asking questions.
Let's have fun.

191
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:57,598
What?!

192
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:03,716
Hey, Jack.

193
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:10,597
Do I... do I know you?

194
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:15,519
Eight-fifteen. You...

195
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:20,031
- You were the stewardess.
- Cindy.

196
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:22,639
How...

197
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:27,357
What are you doing here with them?
I thought you were taken.

198
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:30,398
- You were... you were captured.
- They're not...

199
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:33,756
It's not that simple.

200
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:38,509
What are they doing here, right now?
What are you doing here?!

201
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:42,194
We're here to watch, Jack.

202
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:44,073
Watch what?

203
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:49,078
What is it, sweetheart?

204
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:55,872
She wants to know
how Ana Lucia is doing.

205
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:04,510
- Are you serious?
- What?

206
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:07,433
If you've got something to watch, Cindy,
go watch it!

207
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:10,348
Go!

208
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:39,754
- Sawyer.
- What?

209
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:42,035
Sawyer, wake up.

210
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:46,799
He's gone! Karl's gone!

211
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:48,718
Where?

212
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:56,878
Wait, hold up.

213
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:03,039
I got it.

214
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:06,032
- No, let me talk to him.
- No, I got it.

215
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:07,599
Boys only.

216
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:22,273
- What the hell was that for?
- So you'd cowboy up.

217
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:26,351
Crying in the jungle!

218
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:29,637
I thought you people
were supposed to be tough.

219
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:31,631
I am tough.

220
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:34,951
Sure you are, Bobby.

221
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:39,000
<i>Bobby? The Brady Bunch?</i>

222
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:42,068
<i>What the hell is The Brady Bunch?</i>

223
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:44,791
OK.

224
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:46,950
Anyway, look, Karl...

225
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:52,358
I been with a lot of girls.

226
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:57,271
Some of them worth the trouble...

227
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:00,199
...and some not.

228
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:03,397
But every now and again,

229
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:05,313
there's one...

230
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:13,838
One you name dumb stars with.

231
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:20,238
So this girl,

232
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:22,834
- Sally Slingshot...
- Alex.

233
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:25,036
Yeah. You love her?

234
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:28,753
More than anything.

235
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:33,396
Then go back
to wherever the hell your...

236
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:36,755
...yards are and get her back.

237
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:42,439
If I get caught...
they'll kill me this time.

238
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:50,637
Well, at least it'll be worth it.

239
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:11,392
I want to ask you something.

240
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:15,671
They're not watching anymore,
so you can tell me the truth.

241
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:19,153
OK.

242
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:20,912
Ben.

243
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,433
Why'd you save his life?

244
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:27,794
All this time, after all he did to you
and your people, you should hate him!

245
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:31,675
But you still fixed him up.

246
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:34,433
Even after your friends got away. Why?

247
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:36,792
You're his daughter.

248
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:42,155
- Answer the question.
- I'll answer, if you answer mine.

249
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:47,632
- Where is Juliet?
- She's with the rest of them.

250
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:50,871
- They're gonna read her verdict.
- Her verdict?

251
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:52,951
And we all know what it's gonna be.

252
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:56,951
We're pretty strict about
killing one of our own.

253
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:02,118
- Eye for an eye.
- Who? Who did she kill?

254
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:05,078
The man who was gonna
murder your friends.

255
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:13,192
No wonder you're worried about her.

256
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:17,234
If it wasn't for you,
she never would've done it.

257
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:19,952
That was three questions.

258
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:22,797
Your turn, Jack.

259
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:26,799
I saved your father
because I said I would.

260
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:36,314
Hey. Hey.

261
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:38,559
Is he still in charge?

262
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:40,959
- What?
- Ben, your father.

263
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:43,759
Is he still in charge?
Will Isabel do what he says?

264
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:46,955
- Yeah.
- Get me out of this cage.

265
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:53,353
I wouldn't do that.

266
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:01,313
The cavalry has arrived at last.

267
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:15,715
I'd be much more impressed with you
people if you had a good surgeon.

268
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:21,640
We had an excellent surgeon, Jack.

269
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:25,232
His name was Ethan.

270
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:28,871
You have a serious infection, Ben.

271
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:32,791
That infected tissue needs to be
re-incised and d?brided.

272
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:35,952
And you need to be very closely
monitored from here on out.

273
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:41,235
There might be nerve damage or
any number of other complications.

274
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:44,631
You might not walk again.

275
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:49,231
Your bedside manner
leaves something to be desired, Jack.

276
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:52,680
Well, then it's too bad
you're stuck with me.

277
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:57,359
- Am I?
- You need a doctor, Ben.

278
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:59,908
Someone to stay with you.

279
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:02,112
Bring you back to good health.

280
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:07,755
And here we go again.

281
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:12,438
I've already given you
a ticket off this island, Jack.

282
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:14,750
What's it gonna cost me this time?

283
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:17,479
Right now,
your people are in a room

284
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:21,917
deciding whether or not
to execute Juliet.

285
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:27,356
You're gonna stop it.

286
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:30,559
Juliet doesn't care about you, Jack.

287
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:34,395
It doesn't matter what she's done.

288
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:37,116
No matter what you think...

289
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:41,709
...she is one of us.

290
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:46,634
Do we have a deal or not?

291
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:55,756
Does Isabel have a walkie?

292
00:26:57,320 --> 00:26:59,356
They're already in the meeting.

293
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:08,110
Then get me something to write on.

294
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:22,231
You followed me.

295
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:29,710
What is all this?

296
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:32,992
This is where I work.

297
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:34,433
And you shouldn't be here.

298
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:40,112
This is a...

299
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:43,355
A tattoo parlour.
That was your big secret?

300
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,594
The envelopes? Your gift?

301
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:49,910
I am not a tattoo artist.

302
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:58,670
I am able to see who people are.

303
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:02,593
My work is not decoration.

304
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:04,678
It is definition.

305
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:08,234
And this...

306
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:10,438
This is my gift.

307
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:13,675
So...

308
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:17,275
...you see who people are.
- Yes.

309
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:19,476
And I mark them.

310
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:24,033
So tell me who I am.

311
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:27,433
No.

312
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:30,788
- Why not?
- You are an outsider.

313
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:33,519
- So you can sleep with me...
- I am not allowed.

314
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:40,272
- Do you see who I am, Achara?
- Yes.

315
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:45,198
- Who am I?
- You are a leader.

316
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:48,316
A great man.

317
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:50,798
But this...

318
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:54,712
This makes you lonely.

319
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,558
And frightened.

320
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:00,995
And angry.

321
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:10,958
Good.

322
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:13,513
Now put it on me.

323
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:16,514
Put it on me.

324
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:18,913
No, this...

325
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:22,150
This is against my people.

326
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:34,513
There will be consequences, Jack.

327
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:37,432
There always are.

328
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:04,749
Wait! No. You shouldn't be here.
Just stand back.

329
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:06,998
Don't say anything.

330
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:17,039
Alex, you...

331
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:19,993
Jack?

332
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:23,190
What the hell did you
bring him here for?

333
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:25,430
Let him go, Tom.

334
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:28,438
What's going on, Alex?

335
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:32,038
This is from Ben.

336
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:44,356
Ben has commuted Juliet's sentence.

337
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:48,319
Execution is off the table.
He says the rules don't apply.

338
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:54,035
He has, however,
ordered her to be marked.

339
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:33,751
Where're you going?

340
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:47,315
Hey, I know you.

341
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:50,758
I'm Achara's friend, from...

342
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:53,677
Chet, it's Jack from the restaurant.

343
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:00,672
Let go of me, man!

344
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:26,590
You will get off our beach!
You will leave this country!

345
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:28,750
Do you understand me?

346
00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:31,037
I heard you only liked them grilled.

347
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:36,316
I missed the toothpicks too.

348
00:34:45,640 --> 00:34:47,676
- Let me see.
- Jack...

349
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:49,910
They marked you? Let me see it.

350
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:13,269
- Break a branch off that aloe plant.
- It's OK.

351
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:15,237
Please. Please do it.

352
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:33,278
Turn around.

353
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:57,117
Why did you help me?

354
00:35:57,760 --> 00:36:01,799
He told you he was gonna let you go
home. He told me the same thing.

355
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:06,074
We're gonna make sure
he keeps his word.

356
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:08,674
And how are we going to do that?

357
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:10,193
Together.

358
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:26,517
They'll be coming for you
in a few minutes. All of them.

359
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:29,312
Your friends know where we are.

360
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:32,392
So we have to leave this island
to go back to where we live.

361
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:34,708
Go where?

362
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:37,878
Well, Ben calls it "home. "

363
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:45,079
Where's Karl?

364
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:47,072
I let him go.

365
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:50,231
- You what?
- I let him go.

366
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:52,038
He could lead us to where they live.

367
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:55,112
What, you think I cut him loose
because I'm so damn sensitive?

368
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:56,918
The kid's a target.

369
00:36:58,320 --> 00:36:59,958
Ben won't stop looking for him...

370
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:03,794
All Ben wants is that kid
as far from his daughter as possible.

371
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:07,310
Let's get back to camp.

372
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,070
Are you coming or not?

373
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:16,594
Should I walk beside you
or ten paces behind you?

374
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:20,877
You got so good at telling me
what to do, I can't think for myself.

375
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:23,394
Don't take it out on me,
because you feel guilty.

376
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:25,596
- I don't feel guilty.
- The hell you don't.

377
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:27,830
We had to leave Jack!
I didn't have a choice!

378
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:30,275
I'm not talking
about leaving Jack behind.

379
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:38,596
I'm talking about you and me.

380
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:48,996
I know you did it because
you thought I was a dead man.

381
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:52,876
So don't beat yourself
up because the doc's left behind.

382
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:57,956
I'm not beating myself up.

383
00:37:58,200 --> 00:37:59,952
Of course you're not.

384
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:08,558
So now that we got that
out of the way, let's go.

385
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:37,638
"He walks amongst us,
but he is not one of us. "

386
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:41,079
Your tattoos, that's what they say.

387
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:48,551
That's what they say.

388
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:50,312
It's not what they mean.
