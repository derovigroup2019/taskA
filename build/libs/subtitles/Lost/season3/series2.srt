1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,672
<i>Previously on Lost:</i>

2
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:04,352
I think Michael has been compromised.

3
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:07,512
<i>This camp Michael is leading you to
is where they will set their trap.</i>

4
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:09,716
<i>- I can go ashore undetected.
- How?</i>

5
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:12,155
<i>We will sail the boat and scout them.</i>

6
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:14,959
<i>This time, they will know
that we are coming.</i>

7
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:22,750
- Hi, Jack. I'm Juliet.
- Where are my friends?

8
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:26,077
Tell me where my friends are!

9
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:29,151
My husband says it's time to leave.

10
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:32,516
Jack and the others aren't coming.

11
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:35,751
It's been over a day
since we lit the fire.

12
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:38,673
- They should be here by now.
- Jack knows we're out here.

13
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:41,957
He's counting on our signal.

14
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:50,316
Perhaps he's not able to see the smoke.

15
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:53,551
If he's north of us,
the mountains would block his view.

16
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:58,430
We need to sail along the coast, clear
the mountains, and start another fire.

17
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:03,795
No.

18
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:07,919
I told Jack I would light a fire.
I'm not abandoning him.

19
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:26,759
My husband thinks
we have to do as he says,

20
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:31,197
because he's the only one
who knows how to sail.

21
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,554
But he's wrong.

22
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:37,516
I can help you sail the boat.

23
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:59,591
Are you feeling any better?

24
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:09,796
I made the soup myself, but I won't take
it the wrong way if you don't like it.

25
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:44,519
You never made soup for me.

26
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:52,958
- Am I interrupting something?
- Would it really matter if you were?

27
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:59,110
We have a situation. Brian radioed in.
The Iraqi found the decoy village.

28
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:02,909
- Good. That's what we wanted.
- Brian followed him back to the shore.

29
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,355
- Ben, they have a sailboat.
- How?

30
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:06,555
I have no idea.

31
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:10,394
So they have a boat.
Sailing in circles will keep them busy.

32
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:12,391
They could find us.

33
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:18,550
- Ben...
- I'm thinking.

34
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:22,869
- How quickly to gather a team?
- Within the hour.

35
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:25,838
Then don't waste time talking to us.

36
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:31,915
Hey, Colleen.

37
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:34,750
I want that boat.

38
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:09,079
- Nice alarm clock.
- I've woken up to worse.

39
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:12,149
You want half a fish biscuit?

40
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:31,549
- What's this?
- Lunch.

41
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:35,315
- We need you to keep up your strength.
- Is that right?

42
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:46,236
- Danny, wait.
- Hold up.

43
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:48,231
They have a boat.

44
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,916
OK. Be careful out there.

45
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:02,950
What are you looking at?

46
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:16,831
What's wrong?

47
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:22,593
What's wrong is I'm married.

48
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:25,069
Right. That.

49
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:13,077
I don't wanna share you anymore.

50
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:17,718
Your English is excellent now.
You can go to America.

51
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:24,590
- Does anyone know you're?
- No.

52
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:18,751
All right, here's the jig.

53
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:21,877
You see these rocks here?
That's where you two come in.

54
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:25,350
You're gonna chop 'em loose
and you're gonna haul 'em outta here.

55
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:28,955
- You expect me to work in this dress?
- It's up to you.

56
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:31,759
You can take it off if you want.

57
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:39,391
How dare you.

58
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:42,074
Now, if you need anything,
you raise your hand.

59
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:44,390
- Ten minutes for lunch...
- I got a question.

60
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:46,277
- No questions.
- She asked a question.

61
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:49,796
If you try to run off,
you will be shocked.

62
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:53,555
- Shot? We don't even get a warning?
- Shocked. I said shocked.

63
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:56,518
If you talk to each other,
touch each other,

64
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:58,989
if you're slacking,
you're gonna get shocked.

65
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:03,278
You do anything at all that pisses me
off, you're gonna get shocked, OK?

66
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:06,958
- Let's get to work.
- Not until I see Jack.

67
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:20,276
Now, that was a quarter charge.
You got any more questions?

68
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:33,595
Soon as you're able to walk,
wheelbarrow's right over there.

69
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:04,550
Why should there be a dock
all the way out here?

70
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:07,552
Others.

71
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:09,596
The dock's decaying. It's overgrown.

72
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:12,035
It looks like it hasn't been used
in some time.

73
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:14,111
Whoever built it, they're not here now.

74
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:18,989
Let's bring the boat in, tie it to
the dock and build a fire on the beach.

75
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:21,435
The visibility's excellent,

76
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:25,035
and Jack will be able to see us
from miles around.

77
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:33,558
- Safe?
- Yes, Jin. Of course it's safe.

78
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:00,593
Hey! Get back to work.

79
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:08,190
Whatever you say, boss.

80
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:25,508
Hey.

81
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:29,753
Careful. Don't let them see you
talking to me.

82
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:36,829
Are they keeping you in the cages?

83
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:41,471
Did you see another guy in there
with you, about my age, named Karl?

84
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:44,233
No. It's just Sawyer and me.

85
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:49,359
You're not even supposed
to be in that cage.

86
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:52,034
What are you talking about?
Who are you?

87
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:57,600
Where'd you get that dress?

88
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:01,354
- They gave it to me.
- It's mine.

89
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:06,799
You can keep it.
Looks better on you anyway.

90
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:09,596
Wait.

91
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:13,551
Having fun yet, Freckles?

92
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:16,757
Quit staring at my ass.

93
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:19,354
Give me something else to stare at.

94
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:20,873
Hey!

95
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:24,311
Shut up.

96
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:28,393
Yes, sir, boss.

97
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:38,471
Thank you.

98
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:42,430
- What else can I do?
- Help your husband.

99
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:45,239
We need as much wood as we can find.

100
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:48,834
We're building quite a large fire.

101
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:52,310
We have to make sure
Jack will see the smoke.

102
00:16:56,360 --> 00:17:00,148
Why are you lying to me, Sayid?

103
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:02,629
And what would you know
about lying, Sun?

104
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:11,589
You're putting our lives in danger.

105
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:17,836
I'm fairly certain
our friends have been captured.

106
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:21,310
There are tracks all over the dock.

107
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:25,791
- They're fresh, as recent as yesterday.
- You said this dock was abandoned.

108
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:28,713
That would be part of the lying
you mentioned.

109
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:35,078
You're not building this fire
for our people.

110
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:37,879
You're building it for The Others.

111
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:40,269
I suspect that when they see the smoke,

112
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:42,590
they'll send a scout party
to investigate.

113
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:46,593
By then, it will be night.
When they arrive, I'll ambush them.

114
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:49,433
I'll take two of them hostage
and I'll kill the rest.

115
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:50,919
Two?

116
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,355
One to make the other cooperate.

117
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:06,118
- What do you need me to do?
- Lie to Jin for another 20 minutes.

118
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:11,555
Why?

119
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:15,076
Because once the fire is lit,
it will be too late to go back.

120
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:00,749
Gun.

121
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,230
I don't think I understand.

122
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:20,953
- What is it?
- He knows what we're doing.

123
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:23,711
He knows it's a trap.

124
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:36,669
He says he understands English
better than I think he does.

125
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:45,915
He knows I betrayed him.

126
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,911
Gun.

127
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,470
Can you handle one of these?
It's an automa...

128
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:11,552
I think you'll be safer on the boat.

129
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:23,758
Sun, if by chance they get past us,
there's another gun.

130
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:26,149
It's inside the blue tarp
beneath the galley counter.

131
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:28,959
If they get past you,

132
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:31,474
that means my husband is dead,

133
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:34,512
and I won't care anymore.

134
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:39,910
As I said, the gun is inside the tarp.

135
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:50,350
Hey! Hey! Hey!

136
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:09,670
- Back off!
- James!

137
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:14,515
Put the gun down right now.

138
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:21,798
Put the gun down.

139
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:21,190
I don't think they're coming.

140
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:54,799
I want you to let me off this boat.

141
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:58,110
I can't do that.

142
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:01,838
- Why not?
- It's not my decision to make.

143
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:07,791
- There are five of my friends up there.
- Lower your voice.

144
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:10,274
OK.

145
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:16,350
- Stop. I'll shoot.
- No, you won't, Sun.

146
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:23,670
I know you, Sun-Hwa Kwon,
and I know you're not a killer.

147
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:29,071
Despite what you may think,
I am not the enemy.

148
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:32,232
We are not the enemy.

149
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:37,633
But if you shoot me,
that's exactly what we'll become.

150
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:41,993
Stop. I will. I'll shoot you.

151
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:04,238
Sun!

152
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:05,389
No!

153
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:24,359
No!

154
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:34,879
There!

155
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:42,310
No!

156
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:12,598
I'm sorry I dragged you into this.

157
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:15,831
And please communicate
to your husband,

158
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:18,229
the next time I will listen to him.

159
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:23,714
We should go.
We have a long walk ahead of us.

160
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:59,588
- You OK?
- Never better.

161
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:08,951
- What the hell were you thinking?
- I couldn't help myself.

162
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:13,636
You just looked so damn cute
swinging that pickax.

163
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:16,917
- The chain gang looks good on you.
- Sawyer...

164
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:29,116
Two guards got some real fight in 'em.

165
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:31,953
The rest of 'em
I ain't that much worried about.

166
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:35,430
That heavy-set guy
packs a hell of a punch.

167
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:39,233
Shaggy-haired kid's got
some martial arts training,

168
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:41,072
but I could take him if I had to.

169
00:34:41,160 --> 00:34:44,994
And FYI, those zapper things
got a safety on 'em.

170
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:50,633
Did you see the look on their faces
when you got ahold of that rifle?

171
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:00,470
I'm guessing most of these boys
never seen any real action.

172
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:04,109
But that blonde
who had a gun pointed at you,

173
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:06,475
she would have shot you, no problem.

174
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:10,949
Why'd she call you James?

175
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:17,874
Because that's my name.

176
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:21,397
I noticed something else, too.

177
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:25,912
You taste like strawberries.

178
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,958
You taste like fish biscuits.

179
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,309
So, what do we do now?

180
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:43,470
Well, Shortcake,

181
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:47,233
now we wait for these bastards
to make a mistake.

182
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:51,872
<i>Sooner or later,
they're gonna let their guard down.</i>

183
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:56,750
<i>And when they do, we're gonna be there
to put 'em in their place.</i>

184
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:10,550
Hello, Jack.

185
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:28,235
You know what's crazy, Jack?

186
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:32,393
A week ago, you and I were
in exactly the opposite situation.

187
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:36,314
I was the one locked up, and you were
the one coming in for visits.

188
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:44,150
And I know that you were angry

189
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:47,915
that I lied to you
about who I was, but...

190
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,719
hell, do you blame me?

191
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:55,191
I mean, let's face it, if I'd have
told you I was one of those people

192
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:58,272
you and your friends
have been calling Others all this time,

193
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:02,793
it would've been
right back to Sayid and his...

194
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:04,993
...fists.

195
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:07,555
Wouldn't it?

196
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:11,309
What do you want from me?

197
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:18,149
I want for you to change your...
perspective.

198
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:23,230
And the first step in doing that
would be for me to be decent enough

199
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:26,153
to introduce myself honestly, so...

200
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:35,671
Hi.

201
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:40,240
My name is Benjamin Linus,

202
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:42,675
and I've lived on this island
all my life.

203
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:55,429
You're not gonna shake?

204
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:08,717
Bring it in, please.

205
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:14,475
- Where are Kate and Sawyer?
- They're fine and they're close.

206
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:16,630
That's all I'm able
to tell you right now.

207
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:20,076
- You can tell me anything you want.
- Fair enough.

208
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:25,117
It's all I want to tell you.

209
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:29,031
I'm gonna make this really simple, Jack.

210
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:32,032
If you cooperate, we send you home.

211
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:36,756
- With what?
- When the time is right...

212
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:41,595
- You tell me now.
- Patience, Jack. Patience.

213
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:45,639
Home. Is that where you sent
Walt and Michael?

214
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:48,271
Yes.

215
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:56,272
If you could leave this island,
why would you still be here?

216
00:38:56,360 --> 00:38:58,271
Yes, Jack. Why would we be here?

217
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:04,594
You're lying. You're stuck here
just like we are. You don't have any...

218
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:07,399
Your flight crashed
on September 22nd, 2004.

219
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:11,676
Today is November 29th.
You've been on our island for 69 days.

220
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:14,638
And, yes, we do have contact
with the outside world, Jack.

221
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:16,790
That's how we know
that during those 69 days

222
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:20,190
your fellow Americans
re-elected George W. Bush,

223
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:23,431
Christopher Reeve has passed away,

224
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:25,431
Boston Red Sox won the World Series.

225
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:35,189
- What?
- If you wanted me to believe this,

226
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:38,238
you should've picked somebody else
besides the Red Sox.

227
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:41,869
They were down three games to none
against the Yankees.

228
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:46,590
- Then they won eight straight.
- Sure. Sure. Of course they did.

229
00:39:56,800 --> 00:40:00,998
<i>Back to Foulke.
Red Sox fans have longed to hear it.</i>

230
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:04,277
<i>The Boston Red Sox
are world champions.</i>

231
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:09,758
<i>A clean sweep
of the St Louis Cardinals,</i>

232
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:14,630
<i>and the Red Sox celebrate in the middle
of the diamond here at Busch Stadium.</i>

233
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:24,830
That's home, Jack, right there
on the other side of that glass.

234
00:40:25,720 --> 00:40:28,757
And if you listen to me,
if you trust me,

235
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:31,308
if you do what I tell you
when the time comes,

236
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:33,118
I'll take you there.

237
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:35,278
I will take you home.
