00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,399
<i>Previously on Lost:</i>

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:05,278
There's a rental car parked out front.
Go to Sioux City.

3
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:07,954
I want you to check in
at the Sage Flower Motel.

4
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:10,156
Wait for me.
I'll be there in the a. m.

5
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:12,515
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

6
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:14,556
Go. Go.

7
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:23,199
I don't care what Jack said.

8
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:25,589
They've got him.
We have to get him back. I owe him.

9
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:28,638
Circumstances have changed.
He may not want to be rescued.

10
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:31,109
If he's shaking hands with The Others,
he has a reason.

11
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:33,156
We came to rescue Jack.

12
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:35,435
- Hi.
- What are you doing here?

13
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:37,476
- I came to get you.
- Get out of here.

14
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:39,835
- Get down! Get her down!
- Don't hurt her!

15
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,878
I made a deal with them.
They're gonna let me go.

16
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:46,476
- Where?
- Home.

17
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:50,431
Jack, we need to go.

18
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:55,156
Hold it right there!
Get your hands up!

19
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:57,630
Get down! I said, get down!

20
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:00,715
- What are you doing here, John?
- Sorry, Jack.

21
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:01,869
Sorry for what?

22
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:52,754
I was just bringing you
something to eat.

23
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:56,554
Enjoy your sandwich.

24
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:16,432
Been on the road awhile?

25
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:17,873
How long's it gonna take?

26
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:19,632
Well, your fan belt's shot.

27
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:21,676
It'll take two days, maybe three.

28
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:25,031
Three days for a fan belt?

29
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,633
Welcome to Iowa.

30
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:33,434
- Name's Johnny.
- I'm Lucy.

31
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:48,398
They're all 18 karat gold.
Typically they retail for 500 bucks.

32
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,914
Come on, those don't look real.
I'm not buying.

33
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,434
...going out of business.
You'll never find...

34
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:55,670
If you need a lift,
I'm finished in an hour.

35
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:57,830
What con are you pulling?
I'll call the cops!

36
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:00,036
- Your loss.
- Hey, there a problem, buddy?

37
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:03,829
Yeah, there's a problem.
I'm getting scammed, that's the problem.

38
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:05,956
- I'm sorry.
- Do you think I'm an idiot?

39
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:07,837
Hey, you don't have to buy them.

40
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:10,753
Those are fake necklaces
and you're a rip-off artist.

41
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:12,671
- They're real.
- Call the cops.

42
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:16,438
- I'll sell them to somebody else.
- Hey, let me see those.

43
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:22,393
My father owns a jewellery store.
I think I can spot a fake. How much?

44
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:26,188
- Sixty bucks.
- I'll take the one on the end.

45
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:29,959
Whatever.

46
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:33,752
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

47
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,591
Can I get my money back?

48
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:44,795
Hey!

49
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:49,279
Why'd you help me?

50
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:53,152
Just one girl watching
another girl's back I guess.

51
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:55,071
Or you're stranded here

52
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:58,550
and for some reason you didn't want
that guy calling the cops.

53
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:10,111
I'll give you a ride into town,
you buy me a drink.

54
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:21,909
What?

55
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,035
Kate...

56
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,995
John? What are you doing?

57
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:35,908
- Did they capture you?
- Yes. But only temporarily.

58
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:40,594
I came to say goodbye.

59
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:44,188
- Goodbye?
- I'm leaving with them.

60
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:46,919
What the hell is going on?
What are they doing to you?

61
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,355
Are you brainwashed?
Where did Jack go?

62
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,351
Jack didn't go anywhere, Kate.

63
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:53,874
He's gonna have to stay behind like you.

64
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:55,629
You can't trust them.

65
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:58,518
If they told you they're gonna
take you home, they're lying.

66
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:00,830
I don't want to go home, Kate.

67
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:05,033
I want you to know
I made a strong case for you.

68
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:09,796
I told them that you were a good person.
Reliable. Smart. Honest.

69
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:12,713
And then they told me who you were
and what you had done.

70
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:17,671
Let's just say forgiveness
isn't one of their strong suits.

71
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:23,478
Good luck.

72
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:26,317
- Where are you going?
- Coming out.

73
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,675
Hey... Just...

74
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:32,150
Where's Jack and where's Sayid?
Have you seen Rousseau?

75
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:39,595
John, please, what's happened to you?

76
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:40,829
I'm sorry, Kate.

77
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:14,113
What's wrong with you?

78
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:17,237
Don't look at me,
and pretend we're not talking.

79
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:20,471
- I'm not supposed to be here.
- Good, then scram.

80
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:23,358
Dude, you need to know
that there's been some chatter.

81
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:25,715
After Paulo and Nikki and everything...

82
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:29,634
- Tomorrow there's gonna be a vote.
- A vote for what?

83
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:31,836
To decide whether or not to banish you.

84
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:33,988
Banish me?

85
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,991
- Where?
- There was a debate about that.

86
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:40,197
But the consensus was
half a mile down the beach.

87
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:41,759
"Consensus"?

88
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:45,150
I'm only saying this
because there may be a way to fix it,

89
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:47,834
to like, make amends.

90
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:52,512
- I don't do amends.
- You might wanna ask yourself

91
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:56,036
about all the good stuff that comes
from being a part of this society.

92
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:00,917
I mean, you can't even feed yourself.
You use our latrine,

93
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,390
drink the water Steve brings
every morning to the trough.

94
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:05,549
What?

95
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:09,155
You know how for three days,
ten hours, and 15 minutes

96
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:11,674
- I ain't allowed to use nicknames?
- Yeah?

97
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:14,479
Well, you, sir... Hugo...

98
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:19,992
...are rotund, annoying,
and you're ruining my damn view.

99
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:22,671
How's that for amends?

100
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:25,069
You're making a big mistake, dude.

101
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:28,798
Banish me.

102
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:56,189
How about you tell me your name?

103
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:59,469
- It's Lucy.
- And what's your real name?

104
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:02,634
- Next time, don't think about it.
- I didn't...

105
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:04,312
Not even for a second.

106
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:07,435
So, why "Lucy"?

107
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:08,669
She's a saint.

108
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:10,751
I had to memorize them
in Sunday school,

109
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:13,149
so they're still rattling
around in my brain.

110
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:16,471
What makes a girl who went
to Sunday school scared of cops?

111
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,750
A few months ago I killed my stepfather

112
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:29,150
and escaped from the Marshal
who arrested me for it.

113
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:32,953
Why?

114
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:37,076
Because he was a bad guy.

115
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:43,875
So, what the hell are you doing in Iowa?

116
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:46,793
I want to talk to my mother.

117
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:53,313
You're gonna have
a really hard time doing that.

118
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:55,197
If you did what you just said you did,

119
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:57,953
<i>the feds are gonna be
watching her 24l7.</i>

120
00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:00,429
- I'll figure something out.
- Oh, you will?

121
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:02,992
What, you want to help me?

122
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:10,313
Absolutely.

123
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:12,549
Why?

124
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:20,236
I fell in love with the wrong guy.

125
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:23,628
And then I gave him my life savings.

126
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:27,999
He conned me and embarrassed me.

127
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:29,672
He was a bad guy.

128
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:36,436
So, I'll help you get the meeting
with your mom, "Lucy",

129
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:39,751
because one of us
deserves something good.

130
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,991
I ain't gonna get the Korean vote.

131
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:06,076
Shoot. What the...

132
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:09,551
Come here. Come on.

133
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:35,751
All right. Let's do it.

134
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,115
Do what?

135
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:41,070
I'm ready to do it.
Make amends.

136
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:42,798
Change the vote.

137
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:46,880
I don't want to be banished, OK?
You happy?

138
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:49,719
Dude, you stink.

139
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:51,919
What is that? Fish?

140
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:55,595
- No.
- Did you try to gut one yourself?

141
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:00,749
How have you not learned that by now?
We've been here three months.

142
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:03,434
- Could we just do this?
- Do what?

143
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:06,035
Make nice?

144
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:10,234
Apologize for calling me
all those names.

145
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:15,910
I'm really sorry I called you "rotund".

146
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:19,834
- Really?
- Oh, God. You're worse than a girl.

147
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:23,314
Come on, let's spread the love.

148
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:56,755
- What am I doing here?
- Why don't you tell me?

149
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:59,400
- I don't know.
- Well, I don't know, either.

150
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:01,596
So, why don't you let go of my wrist?

151
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:23,713
So, what the hell happened?

152
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:29,519
I was making a cup of tea.
A canister came in through the window.

153
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:33,991
So, what did you do to piss them off?

154
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:38,876
You're wasting your time.
The knife is too big.

155
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:41,794
- Use something smaller.
- We're going back.

156
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:45,156
What? They did this to us.
Why would we go back?

157
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:47,708
You say "they" like you didn't
lock me in a cage

158
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:49,552
and watch me break rocks all day.

159
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:58,637
We're going back to your village because
my friends were probably gassed like us.

160
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:02,511
Your people are gone anyway.
I saw them all pack up and leave.

161
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:05,194
- What?
- Locke came in and he said goodbye.

162
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:08,152
They were going somewhere else.

163
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,559
Going? Going where?

164
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:11,471
He didn't exactly tell me.

165
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:18,674
Welcome to the wonderful world
of not knowing what the hell's going on.

166
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:48,712
Go, go, go!
On the ground.

167
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:51,155
Get down. On the ground!

168
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:52,798
Let's see those hands.

169
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:54,677
- Get back in the house.
- Got her.

170
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:56,398
Let me see those hands.

171
00:15:57,880 --> 00:15:59,950
Long time no see, Austen.

172
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:09,598
- Who the hell are you?
- I'm just selling Bibles.

173
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:39,629
Hi.

174
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:44,396
They questioned me for half an hour.

175
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:46,675
He confiscated my case.

176
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:49,479
He was asking me about selling Bibles...

177
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:51,278
It's a good thing I know how to lie.

178
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:53,669
Yeah. Now we know
what we're up against.

179
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:57,469
Now we know there were six guys
waiting to take you down, Lucy.

180
00:16:57,560 --> 00:16:59,312
Yeah, it's OK.
I'll figure it out.

181
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:01,038
Figure it out?

182
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:04,237
That Marshal,
I don't know what you did to him,

183
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:07,357
but if he ever gets his hands on you,
it is gonna be you or him.

184
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:11,399
Look, if you've changed your mind,
if you don't want to help me, I get it.

185
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:14,870
No, I do want to help you.
But if I'm lying to federal agents,

186
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:17,315
so that you can have a chat
with your mom,

187
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,310
then I at least need to know
that there's a pretty good reason.

188
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:27,591
He used to get drunk,

189
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:31,311
and beat up my mom,
so I blew up his house.

190
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:35,550
I made it look like an accident.

191
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,439
A gas leak.

192
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,909
Took out an insurance policy
on the house...

193
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:43,874
...for her.

194
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:46,472
Set her up for life.

195
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:51,476
And then she gave me up.

196
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:55,199
Chose him over me.

197
00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:01,115
So the reason I need to talk to her is,

198
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,838
someone I love,

199
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:07,755
someone who's supposed
to care about me, betrayed me.

200
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:09,558
And I want to know why.

201
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:13,835
Well,

202
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,034
then let's go find out.

203
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:23,114
What are you doing?

204
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:27,150
Whoever dragged us out here
left a trail that will lead us back.

205
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:28,389
Let's go.

206
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:32,237
It's gonna rain. Don't you think
we should wait till morning?

207
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:34,948
No.

208
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:45,710
- Why?
- Why what?

209
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:49,952
Why would they handcuff you to me
and then drag us out into the jungle?

210
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:52,508
Ben has a thing for mind games.

211
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:56,995
- Is that why he left you behind?
- Do we really have to talk?

212
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:59,233
Nope.

213
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:07,630
Come on.
If the trail gets wet I'll lose it.

214
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:11,156
I hope you're not dragging me
all the way back there with you for him.

215
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:16,077
- Excuse me?
- I hope you're not going back for Jack.

216
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:21,875
Because I was standing right there
when he told you not to come back.

217
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:24,793
Now that you've ruined his chance
to get off the island...

218
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:39,719
Are you done?

219
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:41,999
I said are you?

220
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:50,517
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to...

221
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:56,552
What the hell was that?

222
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:09,156
- Get up.
- You dislocated my shoulder.

223
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:10,309
Get up!

224
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:12,599
Come on.

225
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:21,232
Quick, in here. Come on.

226
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:23,558
Get in here. Quick.

227
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:25,998
Get down.
Get down.

228
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:28,353
What the hell?

229
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:15,349
Are we safe?

230
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:17,838
You tell me.

231
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:32,996
- I ain't kissing no damn baby.
- Claire's really influential.

232
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:35,036
She votes for you, you're home free.

233
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:38,669
Why wouldn't she vote for me? It's not
like I ever done anything bad to her.

234
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:42,036
No, but you never did anything
good for her, either.

235
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:44,315
And have you
ever even asked how Aaron is?

236
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:47,153
Well, I know how he is.

237
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:50,437
- He cries loud and he smells.
- That's what I'm talking about.

238
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:51,589
You're sarcastic.

239
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:53,671
- People don't like that.
- All right.

240
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:56,832
So I go over and do what?

241
00:21:58,040 --> 00:22:00,998
Moms love it when you show
an interest in their babies.

242
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:05,198
So go over there, say something nice,
call her "Claire"...

243
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:06,952
...and give her this.

244
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:10,154
I know you can do it, dude.

245
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:16,752
Hey, Claire.

246
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:18,834
Hey.

247
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:21,836
Hey there, little baby...

248
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:24,593
...Aaron.

249
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:29,795
Is there anything I can do for you?

250
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:33,475
No. I just came by to say your baby's...

251
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:40,189
He's not as wrinkly
as he was a couple weeks ago.

252
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:48,510
Yeah, I guess he's not.

253
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:50,158
Thanks.

254
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,150
Oh, and this is for you.

255
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:56,989
- Thank you.
- I don't like...

256
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:58,829
...blankets.

257
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:03,915
- Well, good night.
- Good night.

258
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:16,709
Do you think it's gone?
Are we safe?

259
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:19,234
- Are you serious?
- What?

260
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:22,073
- You've never seen that?
- If you don't believe me

261
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:25,072
you can pull my other shoulder
out of its socket.

262
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:27,674
- I wasn't trying to...
- Don't flatter yourself.

263
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:30,274
This is the fourth time
it's been dislocated.

264
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:44,790
Gimme your hand.

265
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:46,711
- Why?
- I want you to pop it back in.

266
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:48,472
- I'm not gonna...
- You're gonna.

267
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:51,870
Right now it feels like
there's broken glass under my skin

268
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:56,476
and if it weren't for you,
I would be on my way home right now.

269
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:59,074
Jack told me not to come back
to protect me.

270
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:01,116
Because he didn't want me to get hurt.

271
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:06,153
- Is that what you think?
- Yeah. That's what I think.

272
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:09,873
We have cameras on the cages, Kate.

273
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:13,072
All of them.

274
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:14,957
He saw you.

275
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:17,713
You and Sawyer.

276
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:21,956
The reason Jack told you
not to come back

277
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:25,996
wasn't because
he didn't want you to get hurt.

278
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:29,872
It was because you broke his heart.

279
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:35,712
So grab my wrist,

280
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:38,509
push up, and twist.

281
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:01,756
Why do we gotta be out here
so damn early?

282
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:04,229
You asked me
to help you catch a boar.

283
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:07,030
This is when they break cover to eat.

284
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:10,436
Looks like they picked today
to sleep in.

285
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:14,115
- So what's your angle, brother?
- My angle?

286
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:17,158
Well, you haven't spoken
three words to me,

287
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:20,391
and suddenly you want to be
my hunting partner.

288
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:26,072
My angle is I've got
hearts and minds to change.

289
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:29,118
And politics is all about bribes.

290
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:33,593
Since money don't mean squat
on this island,

291
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:37,238
I gotta give the people
something they like.

292
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:39,637
And people like meat.

293
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:03,309
How's your shoulder?

294
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:07,556
- Awesome.
- Then let's get going.

295
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:20,034
Thank you.

296
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:22,312
You're welcome, sweetheart.

297
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:39,908
Oh, my God.

298
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,638
I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry.

299
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:43,551
- No worries.
- I'm such an idiot.

300
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:45,631
It happens all the time, sweetheart.

301
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:48,154
Oh, thank you.

302
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:09,273
Hi, Mom.

303
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:13,516
What are you doing here, Katherine?

304
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:18,631
You look good.

305
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:20,957
I asked you what you are doing here.

306
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:29,113
I want to know why you told them
what I did to Wayne.

307
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:36,714
I thought maybe you came because
you wanted to say you were sorry.

308
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:38,429
I'm not sorry.

309
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:43,273
He hit you.
He treated you like a dog.

310
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:45,715
You can't help who you love, Katherine.

311
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:49,513
And for good or bad, I loved him.

312
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:52,798
And you burnt him alive.

313
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:55,630
You turned on the gas
and you lit a match.

314
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:58,236
You murdered him in cold blood.

315
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:03,798
- I did it for you.
- No.

316
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:06,869
What you did, you did for yourself.

317
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:12,758
I have to go back to work.

318
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,309
Because you are my daughter,

319
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:19,914
I'm not gonna tell the two men
sitting at the table

320
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:23,390
who've been following me
for the last month that you are here.

321
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:25,038
But I swear to God, Katie,

322
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:27,632
if I ever see you again,

323
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:30,950
the first thing I will do
is yell for help.

324
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:37,188
Goodbye.

325
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:54,271
- Did he say that to you?
- Sorry?

326
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:56,914
That I broke his heart?

327
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:00,038
He didn't have to.

328
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:06,751
- You don't know anything about him.
- I know where he was born.

329
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:09,798
I know what his parents did
for a living, that he was married.

330
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:14,350
And who he was married to.
I know why he got a divorce.

331
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:16,510
I know how his father died.

332
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:19,194
I know his height, his weight,
his birthday,

333
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:20,918
and his blood type.

334
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:25,110
What do you know about him, Kate?

335
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:31,675
Let's go.

336
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:40,475
Run.

337
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:42,198
Run! Run!

338
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:59,636
Get up. Get up!

339
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:01,631
Run, run! Come on!

340
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:04,912
- Stop. Wait.
- What are you doing?

341
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,719
I know what happens
if you step through those things!

342
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:10,473
- We go alongside.
- We don't need to! They're off!

343
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:13,559
- Damn it!
- What?

344
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:24,758
You're gonna want to be over here.

345
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:28,478
Kate, come on!

346
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:11,795
We don't know what it is, but we know
that it doesn't like our fence.

347
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:13,359
You had a key.

348
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:18,549
They left me behind. They gassed me.
I know that you don't care,

349
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:21,791
but the people I spent
the last three years of my life with,

350
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:23,472
they just left me.

351
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:29,157
I thought that maybe,

352
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:32,878
maybe if I could make you think
that we were in it together,

353
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:38,799
Maybe I wouldn't get left behind again.

354
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:16,428
It's delicious!

355
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:19,398
Just a little Dharma A-1 and paprika.

356
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:23,590
I hope you'll remember this
at your meeting.

357
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:25,750
What meeting?

358
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:29,835
- Hurley told me about the vote.
- Vote?

359
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:32,550
Since when did anyone around here vote?

360
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:44,837
You son of a bitch.

361
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:47,275
- There was never gonna be no vote.
- Right.

362
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:50,869
But wasn't it nice, being nice?

363
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:53,076
You tricked me into being decent?

364
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:55,879
That's gotta be the lamest con
in the history of cons.

365
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:57,188
It wasn't a con, dude.

366
00:32:57,280 --> 00:33:00,670
If you're gonna be our temporary leader
you need to do damage control.

367
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:03,115
Leader?
What the hell are you smoking?

368
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:05,430
Jack's gone, Locke's gone.

369
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:07,397
Kate and Sayid...

370
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:09,474
You're all we got.

371
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:11,519
Paulo and Nikki died.

372
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,274
We all look to you.

373
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:17,319
You totally tried to steal the diamonds,
but we wanted to look to you.

374
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:18,674
Look around.

375
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:22,438
- You made everyone happy.
- It's great!

376
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:26,635
Just for today,
they can eat boar, laugh,

377
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:29,439
and forget that they're totally screwed.

378
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:32,709
And you did that
for them, dude. You.

379
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:40,196
- What if I don't want to be the leader?
- I don't think Jack wanted it, either.

380
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:44,753
Sucks for you, dude.

381
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:17,315
Sayid's in one of those backyards
down there. I'll go get him.

382
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:20,676
You should get Jack.

383
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:36,949
Jack?

384
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:40,555
Jack? Hey.
Jack, wake up, it's me, Kate.

385
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:51,911
- What happened?
- They all left.

386
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:54,955
Left?

387
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:03,512
- What?
- Because of me.

388
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:06,509
I'm so sorry.

389
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:11,678
I should have listened to you.
I never...

390
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:19,990
I wanted to come back to help you.

391
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:23,277
But you didn't need me to.

392
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:29,830
And now, because of me, you can't go.

393
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:44,671
I'm so sorry.

394
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:49,112
I am so sorry.

395
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:54,678
They just...

396
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:57,359
...left?

397
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:04,032
Even... Even Juliet?

398
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:12,199
No, they left her too.

399
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:17,115
Why?

400
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:23,151
You know her better than I do.

401
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:30,269
Now what?

402
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:37,274
Now...

403
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:41,709
Now we go back.

404
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:17,834
- Thanks for everything, Cassidy.
- You got it.

405
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:23,755
So, this guy who ripped you off?

406
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:27,513
Will you give me his name?
Tell me where I can find him?

407
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:31,593
You almost got arrested for me.
I want to help you.

408
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:36,078
I'm pregnant.

409
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:38,108
Oh.

410
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:41,276
It's his. The baby's his.

411
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:46,114
- And I still love him.
- So call the cops. Have him locked up.

412
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:49,112
Will you ever forgive your mom
for calling the cops?

413
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:50,875
No.

414
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,479
No, I won't.

415
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:03,915
Thanks, Lucy.

416
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:07,071
My name's Kate.

417
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:23,588
- Hey.
- Hey.

418
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:26,395
You OK?

419
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:28,429
Yeah.

420
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:29,839
You?

421
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,035
Yeah.

422
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:40,395
Jack.

423
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:45,229
Sayid.

424
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:47,470
I checked all the houses.

425
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:49,118
Everyone's gone.

426
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:51,031
No weapons, no trail.

427
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:54,393
It's like 50 people disappeared
into thin air.

428
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:59,479
We should take what we can find
and head out while we still got light.

429
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:04,993
She is not coming with us.

430
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:11,155
- Yes, she is.
- Why?

431
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:17,477
Because they left her behind, too.
