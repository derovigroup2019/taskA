00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:02,553
<i>Previously on Lost:</i>

2
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:04,312
Desmond said I was gonna die.

3
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:06,630
He told me he has
these flashes, visions.

4
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:10,235
When I saw the lightning hit the roof,
you were electrocuted.

5
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:12,914
When you heard Claire was in the water,
you drowned.

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,479
I dove in so you never went in!

7
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:17,791
No matter what I try to do,
you're going to die, Charlie.

8
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:21,270
There's a woman in Hurley's tent who
parachuted onto the island yesterday.

9
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:23,749
The boat she took off from
is 80 miles off the coast

10
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:26,991
and that if she can find a way
to contact it, we'll all be rescued.

11
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:29,958
- Why didn't anyone tell me this?
- They don't trust you.

12
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:32,190
<i>- Kwon is pregnant.
- Where'd you get that?</i>

13
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:34,714
You're in a position
to be asking us questions?

14
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:36,791
I told Jack what they were making me do.

15
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:38,154
Why didn't you tell us?

16
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:40,754
Because I hadn't decided
what to do about it yet.

17
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:17,718
Anyone want to guess
as to what Jack's gonna be showing us

18
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:19,279
out in the middle of nowhere?

19
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:21,351
I don't know... stuff?

20
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:24,071
Probably secret stuff.

21
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:26,151
Why does everything
have to be a secret?

22
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:28,674
How about some openness for a change?

23
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:31,718
- We kept the parachute lady secret.
- That's different.

24
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:33,233
Different how?

25
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:36,437
Because we weren't out there
playing football with them.

26
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:39,159
- What?
- Nothing.

27
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:43,594
Wait. You had one of your flashes
again, didn't you?

28
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:46,558
No, Charlie. I didn't.

29
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:50,069
We're here.

30
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:06,638
A couple of nights ago, Juliet
came to me and she told me everything.

31
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:10,557
Ben sent her here to find out
which of our women were pregnant.

32
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:12,392
You guys were doing tests on us?

33
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:15,631
No. But that's what he wanted me to do.

34
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:18,871
I've been leaving tapes
at the medical station.

35
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:22,270
You all heard what he said.
They're coming tomorrow.

36
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:26,113
Sun, I'm sorry
that I lied to you.

37
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:28,956
While I appreciate your honesty, Jack,

38
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:32,237
it doesn't explain
why you brought us out here.

39
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:35,993
Danielle!

40
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:46,114
Show them.

41
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:08,551
When Juliet told me they were coming,

42
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:11,311
the first thing I thought was,

43
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:13,789
"Where the hell
are we gonna hide this time?"

44
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:18,519
But hiding is pointless.
They're just gonna keep coming back.

45
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:21,478
So I went out and I found some help.

46
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:25,473
The past few days, she's been bringing
dynamite back from the Black Rock.

47
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:28,438
For the very first time,
we know exactly what they want,

48
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:32,399
when they're coming to get it,
and they have no idea

49
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,630
that we're gonna be waiting for them.

50
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:39,713
So Juliet's gonna mark the tents with
white rocks, just like she was told to.

51
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:43,313
But there's not gonna be
any pregnant women inside.

52
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:46,631
There's gonna be plenty
of what we just used on that tree.

53
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:49,917
So tomorrow night... we stop hiding.

54
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,992
We stop running.
We stop living in fear of them.

55
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:54,991
Because when they show up...

56
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:59,510
...we're gonna blow them all to hell.

57
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:24,952
Bloody hell! Why are we even doing this?

58
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:28,430
- Chin up, mate. We're headlining.
- Headlining?

59
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:31,034
We're playing Clitheroe,
the arse end of nowhere.

60
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:33,759
A gig's a gig.
We're building our fan base.

61
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:36,912
Will our fan base
pay for a new sodding tire?

62
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,834
Only if we show up.
So let's just get on with it, shall we?

63
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:44,674
You know what, Liam?
You get on with it. I quit.

64
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:45,954
You're giving up?

65
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:48,998
There's nothing to give up on!
We're broke!

66
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:51,275
The album's not selling!
We're a joke.

67
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,713
Hey! Shut it!

68
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:54,633
Listen!

69
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:00,029
That's us.

70
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:04,594
We're on the radio.

71
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:10,914
- That we are.
- On the bloody radio!

72
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:15,319
Oh, yeah!

73
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:17,436
- Hey!
- Oh! I told ya, baby brother.

74
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,317
We're gonna be bloody rock stars!

75
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:28,556
Can I ask you something?

76
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:29,868
Yeah.

77
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:33,833
Who are you people
about to go to war with?

78
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:36,832
That's a long story.
Want to ask me something else?

79
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:39,954
- You having a laugh?
- No, of course not.

80
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:42,918
I'd never disrespect a fellow Mancunian.

81
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,514
- You're from Manchester, then?
- I am.

82
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:46,715
My band got its start

83
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:49,075
at the Night and Day bar
on Oldham Street.

84
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:51,196
- What band?
- We were called Drive Shaft.

85
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:55,193
- Yeah, yeah. I know you.
- We had our moment in the sun.

86
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:57,874
No, not that. The crash.
You're the dead rock star.

87
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:00,679
They made a big deal out of you
when they found the plane.

88
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:03,877
- Huge memorial service, new album...
- There's a new album?

89
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:07,077
Yeah. God, it was everywhere.
A greatest hits thing.

90
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:16,591
Hey, look on the bright side.
You're not really dead, right?

91
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:18,995
Yeah, right.

92
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:46,279
We need more wire so that we can trigger
these from a safe distance.

93
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:49,193
I can get people to start stripping
the plane wreckage.

94
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:53,068
We should be able to finish rigging
these tents in the next 24 hours.

95
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:55,071
We'll be ready by tomorrow night.

96
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:02,909
- We need to talk about Naomi's phone.
- Not now.

97
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,356
If you are angry I doubted you,
I'll make an apology later. But now...

98
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:08,795
Look, I'm a little bit
busy right now, Sayid.

99
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:11,235
And I'm trying
to get us off this island, Jack.

100
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:16,398
I can't transmit using this phone

101
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:19,995
because Danielle's distress signal
is overriding the frequency.

102
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:22,036
If you tell me where the radio tower is,

103
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:24,475
I can switch off your message
and call for help.

104
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:28,314
My signal has been playing for the last
16 years and nobody has heard it.

105
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:33,110
- What makes you think you'll have luck?
- Naomi's boat is 80 miles offshore.

106
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:36,237
I know if we eliminate
Danielle's signal, they'll hear us.

107
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:38,151
No, they won't.

108
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:40,435
And why is that?

109
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:42,192
- We're jamming it.
- What?

110
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:44,191
Ben is using one of the Dharma Stations

111
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:47,113
to block all of the signals
off of the island except ours.

112
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:50,272
- What station?
- They call it the Looking Glass.

113
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:52,635
- The Looking Glass?
- Yes, it's underwater.

114
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:54,870
I have no idea where it is.

115
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,673
I believe I do.

116
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:01,552
Look, I know Jack thinks it's best,

117
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:03,790
but what if they're coming
for him again?

118
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:07,553
Claire, listen to me.

119
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:10,996
I'm going to protect you.
I'm going to protect Aaron.

120
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:16,029
I promise.
Everything is going to be fine.

121
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,310
Sorry.

122
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:25,358
Charlie, can you give me
a hand with something?

123
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:29,358
Yeah, Desmond, of course.

124
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:44,120
So, you ready to tell me
what you saw this morning?

125
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,474
Aye.

126
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:49,599
Right. So how does it happen this time?

127
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:55,917
Come on, Des.
You can tell me. I can take it.

128
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:03,114
What I saw, Charlie, was...

129
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:06,792
...Claire and her baby
getting into a helicopter...

130
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:12,159
...a helicopter that...
that lifts off, leaves this island.

131
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,036
- Are you sure?
- Aye.

132
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:25,118
Rescue helicopter? On this beach?
This island? That's what you saw?

133
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:29,796
We're getting bloody rescued?

134
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:32,713
I thought you were gonna tell me
I was going to die again!

135
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:38,673
You are, Charlie.

136
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:41,793
Wait. What?

137
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:46,517
If you don't, none if it will happen.

138
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:50,556
There won't be any rescue.

139
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:56,988
I'm sorry, brother.
But this time...

140
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:01,596
This time you have to die.

141
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:13,157
Come on. Come on.

142
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:16,754
Come on. Come on, Charlie.

143
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:19,479
Jump in. I'm gonna catch ya, boy.

144
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:22,552
No. You're just gonna back away.

145
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:24,596
Don't be daft. Jump in.

146
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:29,311
- No!
- I promise. I'm gonna catch ya!

147
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:31,038
No, he won't!

148
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,633
Zip it, you!

149
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:37,356
Don't listen to your brother.
Just jump on in.

150
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:42,239
There's nothing
to be afraid of, Charlie.

151
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:45,995
I'll catch ya. I promise.

152
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,237
I did it!

153
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,991
- You got it!
- I did it!

154
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:15,595
You're swimming, Charlie!
You're swimming.

155
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:23,393
What're you writing?

156
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:31,235
Nothing.

157
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,836
All right, tell me.

158
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:44,113
You sure you want to know?

159
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:50,712
- It might be easier if you just...
- Yeah. I want to know.

160
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:57,353
You're inside a hatch. It's...

161
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:00,432
...a room full of equipment.

162
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:04,271
There's a blinking yellow light
above a switch.

163
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:06,157
You flick the switch.

164
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,514
The light goes off.

165
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:16,553
And then you drown.

166
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:28,433
When?

167
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:32,309
I don't know.

168
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:35,756
You're sure you saw Claire and Aaron
get on that helicopter?

169
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:37,034
Aye.

170
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:40,958
So...

171
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:44,833
...before I... drown,

172
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:47,792
I just have to flick the switch?

173
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:50,715
That's right.

174
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:56,559
Where is it then?

175
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:04,191
This is the Looking Glass.
It's an underwater Dharma station.

176
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:07,556
Please, can you tell me anything
you might know about this place?

177
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:10,518
I've never been down there.
I don't know anyone who has.

178
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:12,318
Why not?

179
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:16,953
There was some accident. Ben told us
that the station was completely flooded.

180
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:20,635
- If it's flooded how does it work?
- How it still works is irrelevant.

181
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:23,075
The question is
how do we get it to stop working,

182
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:24,991
so we can use the satellite phone.

183
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:31,193
The diagram shows that the Looking Glass
is connected to the island by a cable.

184
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:34,352
I feel sure that this is
the very same cable down the beach

185
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:35,793
which runs into the ocean.

186
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:38,713
If we follow the cable,
it should lead us to the station.

187
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:42,031
- So how're we gonna get in?
- We swim in.

188
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:43,394
There's a moon pool,

189
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:46,392
a room with an open floor
at the base of the station,

190
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:48,630
big enough for a submarine to dock.

191
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:50,278
Even if the station's flooded,

192
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:53,272
I think I'll be able to find
the relay switch and disable it.

193
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:54,952
What about swimming back out?

194
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:57,508
No.

195
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:01,149
I'm not letting you go on some
suicide mission just to flip the switch.

196
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:03,993
Someone has to do it,
or we'll never leave this island.

197
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:05,399
I'll do it.

198
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:08,711
Swim down, turn off that switch,
swim back up. Piece of cake.

199
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:10,870
You don't know what we're talking about.

200
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:14,396
I was junior swim champion.
I can hold my breath for four minutes.

201
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:17,153
I know exactly
what you're talking about, Jack.

202
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:22,876
No. And there's no reason
to do this now.

203
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:24,598
We're gonna focus on the Others,

204
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:26,272
- then deal with this.
- Wait.

205
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:28,191
We have a chance
to signal for a rescue.

206
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:31,477
For 90 days, I've been asked
to make decisions for this camp.

207
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:33,676
There you go. I just made one.

208
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:45,478
Rose, that's a sailor's hitch.
It's not gonna hold.

209
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:48,757
- You wanna do a sheet bend like mine.
- Now you're a knot expert?

210
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:51,673
Well, trust me, it's...

211
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:57,351
How did you do that?

212
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:59,954
Watch and learn, dear, watch and learn.

213
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:04,357
Hey! Look, there! Look!

214
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,434
- Get off him! It's OK!
- What?! He's one of them!

215
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:24,556
I know! I know, it's OK.

216
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,470
He was in the cage next to me!
I know this guy!

217
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:32,154
What the hell are you doing here, Karl?

218
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:35,198
They're... coming. My people...

219
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:37,748
Sorry you came all this way,
but we already know.

220
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:39,239
Then why are you still here?

221
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:42,039
When your people
show up here tomorrow, we're ready.

222
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:45,192
Tomorrow? No!
No, they're coming tonight!

223
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:53,551
They're coming right now!

224
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:02,749
Hey!

225
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:08,475
- When'd you get back?
- Just now.

226
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:12,675
Where's Locke?

227
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:15,913
Here's your gun back.

228
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:23,600
- Ben, what's going on?
- Where's Ryan?

229
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:26,558
- He's at his tent. Are you alone?
- It's time to get them.

230
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:30,909
- Wait a minute. But you said tomorrow.
- Jacob wants it to happen now.

231
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,150
What happened out there?
Did John see?

232
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:34,673
John had an accident.

233
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,752
- Ryan!
- Yes, sir.

234
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:43,076
If you leave now, how long
will it take you to reach their camp?

235
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:45,594
If I take my ten best
we can hit them by nightfall.

236
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:48,990
- Then you better get going.
- No, Ben. Moving up the schedule...

237
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:50,911
Juliet may not be ready. What if...

238
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,036
Then we'll take all their women.

239
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:56,799
And we'll sort out
the ones we need later.

240
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:57,995
And the men?

241
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:01,709
If any of them are stupid enough
to get in your way, kill them.

242
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:03,836
All right.

243
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:17,198
Karl!

244
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:20,233
It's me.

245
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:26,836
- I thought you were bringing rabbit.
- You have to go. Now.

246
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:28,638
What? Did he find out I was out here?

247
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:31,518
No. He's sending Pryce
to their beach camp right now.

248
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:33,113
- You warn them!
- Warn them?

249
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,668
- Go now!
- They were gonna take pregnant women.

250
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:38,877
Take the outrigger, you'll get there
a few hours before them.

251
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:41,713
- Wait, Alex.
- He's gonna kill them, Karl!

252
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:47,436
Austen and Ford saved your life.

253
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:51,709
You owe them.

254
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:56,359
You'd better take this.

255
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:01,715
If I get caught,
your father's gonna kill me.

256
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:03,392
Is he my father?

257
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:13,592
Now, go.

258
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:40,316
- Is that everything?
- Yeah.

259
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:43,709
Do you trust him?

260
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:46,030
You don't trust me? What about her?

261
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:48,350
She's a spy.

262
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:52,115
She's supposed to mark the tents
of the pregnant women with white rocks.

263
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:55,351
They know, Karl. But, thanks.

264
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:58,759
- So what're we gonna do?
- We have to leave now, hide.

265
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:02,276
Where? It's their island.
If they wanna kill us, they'll find us.

266
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:06,751
Sun's gonna go down in a few hours.
We have enough wire yet?

267
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:07,909
Not even close.

268
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,514
We gotta figure out a way
to set the dynamite off.

269
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:12,636
- We can shoot.
- We don't have enough guns.

270
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:15,473
- He said that ten of them are coming.
- The tents.

271
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:17,869
We camouflage the dynamite
next to the tents,

272
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:20,349
target it from our positions
at the tree line.

273
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:25,438
Juliet marked three tents.
That means we need three guns.

274
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:28,595
Here. You can have mine, too.

275
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:31,392
I'll be your third.

276
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:34,834
We'll take your gun,
but you're not staying here.

277
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:39,228
You're gonna lead everyone
to the radio tower.

278
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:40,799
Radio tower?

279
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:44,031
We can't risk losing the chance
to contact with Naomi's boat.

280
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:46,998
So everything has to happen
at the same time.

281
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:52,356
Charlie, you still up for a swim?

282
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:56,999
Yeah, I believe I am.

283
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:00,591
I'll go with him.

284
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:03,433
OK. We better get to it.

285
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:21,799
It's here, baby brother!
Christmas is here!

286
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:26,112
Are these the birds from row two?

287
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:29,439
Well done, mate.

288
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:37,310
Well, as you have spent another year

289
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:39,834
as the only drug-free rock star
in the world,

290
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:42,514
I am going to share
a little known fact with you.

291
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:47,917
Father Christmas lives
just down the street from here.

292
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,833
- Father Christmas lives in Helsinki?
- Indeed he does.

293
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:53,150
In case you haven't noticed,
baby brother,

294
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:55,435
Finland is the bloody North Pole.

295
00:21:57,040 --> 00:22:01,556
Therefore, a very special gift for you
this year.

296
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:09,196
Liam, no. Mum gave you that.

297
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:10,793
You're the first born.

298
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:13,678
It was her father's
and his father before that...

299
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:15,159
And it's a family heirloom,

300
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:18,676
and that's why we named the band
after Dexter bloody Stratton. I know.

301
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:20,830
But Charlie, let's be honest.

302
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:24,151
We both know I'm a sodding mess.

303
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:26,549
But you, you're different.

304
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:30,519
You're gonna get married,
have a family, a baby.

305
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:34,828
- I'll be lucky if I hit 30.
- Don't say that, Li.

306
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:38,356
The ring has to stay
in the family, Charlie.

307
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:42,869
So please, take it.

308
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:46,076
Mum would've wanted it this way.

309
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:48,390
Pass it on to your little one someday.

310
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:50,914
I need to know it's safe.

311
00:22:57,320 --> 00:22:59,390
I'll hold on to it.

312
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:03,671
But I won't take it.

313
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:09,831
Hey, it fits. Look at that.

314
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:11,751
Happy Christmas, baby brother.

315
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:43,268
You need some help?

316
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:47,069
Why didn't you tell me
you were going to do this?

317
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:54,279
I didn't want you to worry.

318
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:59,514
Well, it's dangerous, isn't it,
swimming into some underwater station?

319
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:03,149
It's what needs to be done
to get us all rescued.

320
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:06,351
I'll be fine, Claire.

321
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:09,512
You gotta promise me something.

322
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:12,279
While I'm gone...

323
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:16,519
...don't worry about me.

324
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:21,829
OK.

325
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:30,349
I'll take him.

326
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:33,515
Thanks.

327
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:35,913
Hey...

328
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:42,436
All right, turnip head.

329
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:47,672
You take care of your mum,
while I'm away, OK?

330
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:58,119
I love you.

331
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:17,714
See you soon.

332
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:24,830
Be careful, Charlie. OK?

333
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:26,114
Yeah.

334
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:19,795
I'm sorry, guys.
Thanks, man.

335
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:31,790
Help! Help me!

336
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:36,192
Help! Please! Please!

337
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:40,352
- You, stop!
- Hey!

338
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:42,237
Get the hell away from her!

339
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:45,274
What're you doing? Leave her alone!

340
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,558
You OK, miss?

341
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:51,870
Yes. I think so, yes.

342
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:55,238
Here you go.

343
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:58,191
Pardon me while I have a heart attack.

344
00:26:58,280 --> 00:27:00,794
Last time I was in a fight,
I was eight years old.

345
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:04,359
And I lost.

346
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:09,279
Well, that makes you
even more of a hero, doesn't it?

347
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:13,797
- I just did what anyone would do.
- Three people walked by the alley.

348
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:16,153
- What?
- They saw me...

349
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:18,435
...but they just kept on going.

350
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:22,550
You are a hero, sir.

351
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:26,633
And don't let anyone
ever tell you differently.

352
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:43,792
- What's that?
- It's weight belt.

353
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:46,678
It should bring you down
quicker than swimming.

354
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:49,279
Well, every second counts.

355
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:52,951
So I just take it off when I hit bottom,

356
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:56,510
swim up through the moon pool
into the station,

357
00:27:57,560 --> 00:28:01,235
swim into whichever room has
the yellow blinking switch,

358
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:03,109
flip it.

359
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:07,028
Nothing to it.

360
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:13,954
So how long can you really
hold your breath for?

361
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:18,112
Does it matter?

362
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:28,032
- You want me to hit another one?
- No. You've made your point.

363
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:30,998
Bernard, this is not pheasant hunting
in Montgomery.

364
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:33,640
- I know what I'm doing.
- Pheasants don't shoot back.

365
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:37,633
Nothing's gonna happen to me, Rose.
I just have to shoot a tent.

366
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:41,235
- And I'll be right behind you.
- Then I'm staying, too.

367
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:42,878
No, you're not, Rose.

368
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:47,113
Everyone's gathering down
at the south end of the beach.

369
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:49,475
- No one's staying but the shooters.
- Says who?

370
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:53,235
You wanna give me your word that
nothing's gonna happen to my husband?

371
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:54,594
Then I'll go.

372
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:59,710
If we don't kill everyone
who shows up here in about an hour,

373
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:01,836
it's not gonna matter where Bernard is.

374
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:08,036
I like you better since you got back,
Jack. You're almost an optimist.

375
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:09,155
Come on.

376
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:13,119
If you're gonna be hiding in the bushes,
let's get you into something dark.

377
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:17,233
You better get going.

378
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:20,118
Rousseau says it's a day's walk
up to the radio tower.

379
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:22,395
I'm not taking them to the tower,
you are.

380
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:26,795
- Excuse me?
- You're not staying behind.

381
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:30,720
- This was my idea.
- I'm capable of executing it.

382
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:33,553
- I owe them!
- What are you more concerned with?

383
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:36,837
Killing the Others
or getting our people off this island?

384
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:41,189
This afternoon
you said you were our leader.

385
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:47,917
It's time for you to act like one.

386
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:54,593
Lead them to the radio tower, Jack.

387
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:58,072
And then take us all home.

388
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:10,557
Dudes! Wait!

389
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:14,429
I heard.

390
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:17,478
I heard what you're doing.
I wanna come with.

391
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:23,673
Everyone, they're all goin'
to the radio tower,

392
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:27,514
and I'm sick of trekking,
and, you know, explosions.

393
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:32,709
I think I can help you guys out.
I'm a really good paddler.

394
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:40,354
You can't go, Hurley.

395
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:43,069
Why not?

396
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:46,999
Because...

397
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:52,630
...you're too big.
You won't fit in the boat.

398
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:01,679
That's uncool, man.

399
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:07,796
Wait! Wait! Wait!

400
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:12,871
Dude. It's fine. I don't even
wanna go on your stupid boat.

401
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:20,112
I'll catch up with you later.

402
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:24,070
- Just remember I love you, man.
- Yeah, whatever. I love you, too.

403
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:42,152
You got water in there? Good. Good.

404
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:44,835
How about you? Lot of water? Good.

405
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:47,109
Hey.

406
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:50,954
- Hey.
- So here we go again.

407
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:54,556
Here we go again.

408
00:31:57,320 --> 00:32:01,154
- The tents are all marked. We're set.
- Sayid find a third shooter?

409
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:14,154
Ready, Claire?
Need a hand with the little guy?

410
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:16,117
No thanks, I'm OK.

411
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:25,315
How's my little sweetheart?

412
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:31,111
We're just gonna go for a little walk,
so hold on to Mum, OK?

413
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:55,439
This is it.

414
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:04,072
Ready?

415
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:15,839
Hiya.

416
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:17,831
Do you want a blanket?

417
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:19,239
Oh, thanks, I've got one.

418
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:23,353
Well, you're warming for two. Take mine.

419
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,069
Thank you.

420
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:37,678
So, first plane crash?

421
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:42,516
- What gave it away?
- You can always spot the newbies.

422
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:49,436
We're gonna be OK, you know.

423
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:52,273
Are we?

424
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:55,830
We're alive, on a beautiful island.

425
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,513
We'll sleep under the stars,

426
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:02,479
and before you know it, the helicopters
will come and take us all home.

427
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:05,358
You really think they'll find us?

428
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:08,431
Well, yeah, why wouldn't they?

429
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:11,195
Thanks.

430
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,230
- I'm Charlie.
- I'm Claire.

431
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:19,913
- Nice to meet you, Charlie.
- It's nice to meet you.

432
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:42,357
We're here.

433
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:54,789
I want you to give this
to Claire for me.

434
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:01,953
What is it?

435
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:08,958
It's the five best moments of my...

436
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:12,150
...sorry excuse for a life.

437
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:16,279
My greatest hits.

438
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:23,317
You know...

439
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:29,993
...memories... are all I've got.

440
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:33,591
You don't have to do this, Charlie.

441
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:35,835
What?

442
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:41,833
- I'll go.
- No, your flashes...

443
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:45,754
Maybe I keep seeing you die
because...

444
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:49,830
...I'm supposed to take your place.

445
00:36:55,240 --> 00:36:58,152
What about your girl? Penny?

446
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:01,919
What about your girl?

447
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:07,593
Besides...

448
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:14,154
...I might be luckier than you.

449
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:24,118
Keep your memories to yourself.

450
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:29,559
I'll take it from here.

451
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:38,273
I don't know what to say.

452
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:44,155
Well, you can tell me
where the weight belt is.

453
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:46,959
Right there behind you.

454
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:16,711
You and I both know you're not
supposed to take my place, brother.

455
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:19,829
I'm alive. I'm alive!
