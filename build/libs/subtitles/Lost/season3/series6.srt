00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,479
<i>Previously on Lost:</i>

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:05,438
<i>Two days after I found out
I had a fatal tumour on my spine,</i>

3
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:07,431
<i>a spinal surgeon fell out of the sky.</i>

4
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:10,114
<i>We had such a wonderful plan
to break you, Jack.</i>

5
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:12,794
My wonderful plan
got shot to sunshine

6
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:15,553
when you saw my X-rays
and figured out I was dying.

7
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:17,596
You want me to save your life.

8
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:19,989
I want you to want to save my life.

9
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:22,951
All I can ask is that
you think about it.

10
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:13,352
Police. Open the door.

11
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:17,713
Everything's all right here.

12
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:20,872
We have reason to believe
someone dangerous is in the motel.

13
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:22,996
We're conducting
a room-to-room search.

14
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:24,433
I'm alone, officer.

15
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:27,273
You could be held at gunpoint,
forced to say that.

16
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:29,828
- Please open the door.
- I don't think I should.

17
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:33,196
Ma'am, you have three seconds
before I break this door down.

18
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:35,748
One... two...

19
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:40,238
Hey.

20
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,471
Wanna get it on?

21
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:45,593
Hell, yeah.

22
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:52,672
<i>Warning.</i>

23
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:57,674
<i>Warning.</i>

24
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:02,078
Hey.

25
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:05,392
Hey yourself.

26
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:09,310
<i>- Warning.
- Whatcha doing?</i>

27
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:11,839
Throwing rocks.

28
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:13,993
<i>Warning.</i>

29
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:18,833
- I thought you had to pull the lever.
- I know how to get a fish biscuit.

30
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,511
Then get me one.

31
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:25,200
What, you trying to keep me
feeling productive?

32
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:50,151
You took these blood tests
and made all the notations?

33
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:54,871
- How old are the X-rays?
- A week.

34
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:59,314
The tumour on your spine
is borderline inoperable.

35
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:03,029
At the rate it's growing,
that borderline goes away in about...

36
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,917
...one week.

37
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:16,395
The O.R. We were in,
is that fully equipped?

38
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:17,589
Yes.

39
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:20,877
- Anaesthesia? Sterile?
- Yes.

40
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:27,515
You need to be in surgery yesterday.

41
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,633
All right, then.

42
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:37,955
Whatever you need, it's yours.
I'm ready.

43
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:41,192
No, I think you misunderstood me.

44
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:44,352
I didn't say I was gonna do it.

45
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:47,591
I just wanted you to understand
how you're gonna die.

46
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:53,591
You think I believe you people?

47
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:56,717
You think I trust you?
That I'm gonna just do the surgery

48
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,791
and hope that you let me go?

49
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:01,553
- Jack...
- No, don't!

50
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:16,874
Well, Jack, I'm very disappointed
in your decision.

51
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:23,151
Well, Ben...

52
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:26,198
...at least you won't
have to be disappointed for very long.

53
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:54,229
You shouldn't have come here.

54
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:57,832
Yeah. You're right.

55
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:01,911
I've made a huge mistake.
I am just full of regret right now.

56
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,956
Seriously!

57
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:07,033
It's bad luck to see
the bride before the wedding.

58
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:11,714
It's bad luck to see the bride
in her dress before the wedding.

59
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:13,552
You, my friend, are naked.

60
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:18,719
Have you tried it on?

61
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:23,278
I have to hold my breath to get
the claspy things to clasp, so...

62
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:26,112
I'm waiting till the last minute.

63
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:29,397
Well, that's in about 12 hours,
you might wanna get clasping.

64
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:38,399
Hey.

65
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:42,193
I know it's...

66
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,472
It's been fast.

67
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:48,514
But this is right.

68
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,551
I know it's real.

69
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:57,157
And I love you, Monica.

70
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:01,395
I love you too, Kevin.

71
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:18,078
Come on. Time for work.

72
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:25,078
- What about him?
- Oh, he's got the day off.

73
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:28,675
- If he's not working, neither am I.
- You're not?

74
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:29,988
Just go, Freckles.

75
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:34,913
Man wants to give me a day off,
let him give me a day off.

76
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,560
No, Sawyer. We're a team.

77
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:39,198
You break the rocks. I haul 'em.

78
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:43,155
All right. Fine.

79
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:56,752
Lord knows I wouldn't
wanna break up the team.

80
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,957
What happened to him?

81
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:27,239
Must've been an animal.
Maybe one of the bears.

82
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:29,788
- Are we gonna carry him back?
- No.

83
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:32,397
We're gonna bury him here.

84
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:35,750
- Are we?
- The people back at camp...

85
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:38,594
There's just been a few
too many funerals lately.

86
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,831
Nobody needs to see him like this.

87
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:43,070
I'll slip back to the beach
and get shovels.

88
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:44,752
- I'll come.
- No, I'll be back...

89
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:46,831
It's not safe to go alone, John.

90
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:53,117
I appreciate your concern.

91
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:04,514
So, what killed Eko?

92
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:10,633
Folks back at the beach
call it the monster.

93
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:12,871
I don't really have a name for it.

94
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:17,796
- You don't believe in monsters.
- I believe in what I can see.

95
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,875
But obviously, you have.

96
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:26,990
- Tell me what you think it is.
- Might be what brought us here.

97
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:30,231
So you believe this monster
decided that Eko was meant to die?

98
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:33,198
I believe Eko died for a reason.

99
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:35,555
I just don't know what it is yet.

100
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:37,594
Is that why you lied?

101
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:41,594
We're not headed back
towards the camp, are we?

102
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:44,593
Sure, we are.

103
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:46,989
Just need to take a little detour first.

104
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:00,073
<i>- Compound breach.
- Someone's on the grid.</i>

105
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:03,869
Where is she? Someone's on the grid.
I want him on the ground. Her too.

106
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,632
If he moves, you shoot him.

107
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:10,398
Yeah. They're here.
Did the doctor get out again?

108
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,513
You sure?

109
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,192
Well, does he know?

110
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:16,748
How the hell did she get over here?

111
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:22,790
- Get up! Come on, get up! Go!
- Alex! Alex!

112
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:26,113
- What do you think you're doing?
- You gonna shoot me?

113
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:28,475
You're not supposed to be here.
Just calm...

114
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:31,358
What did you do to him, Danny?
Where is he?

115
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:36,716
- I want to talk to Ben.
- Sure. That sounds like a great idea.

116
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:40,031
- Why don't we lower the slingshot...
- Where is he? Tell me!

117
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:43,834
- Get off of me!
- Get her out of here.

118
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,069
Get her out of here!

119
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:48,869
Put me down! Listen,
whatever they say, don't believe them,

120
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:52,794
they're gonna kill your boyfriend!
Just like they killed mine!

121
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:15,028
I don't understand.
It's supposed to be two weeks.

122
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:17,759
- Our schedule moved up.
- Is that an order?

123
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:21,879
- That's stupid.
- It's not my call. It's the way it is.

124
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:29,592
I would like for you to put this on
and come with me, please.

125
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:33,715
You think I'll do it
because you said please?

126
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:37,873
No, you'll put a hood over your head
because the man standing behind me,

127
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:40,474
the one who's burning a hole in my back,

128
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:43,679
that man is going to kill Sawyer.

129
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:46,069
But if you put this on
and you come with me,

130
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:49,072
there's something you can
do for us that will save his life.

131
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:31,993
Come in.

132
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:37,998
Oh, sweetheart, you're beautiful.

133
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:42,316
Absolutely beautiful.

134
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:47,432
- How is it out there?
- There are a lot of excited policemen.

135
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:52,709
I've asked them not to shoot their guns
in the air when you say "I do. "

136
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:57,757
You know, mothers-in-law
aren't supposed to be so nice.

137
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:04,271
Monica, I have something for you.

138
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:09,118
Suzanne, you shouldn't have.

139
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,760
My mother gave that to me
on my wedding day.

140
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:16,153
She told me someday
I'd give it to my daughter,

141
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:19,312
but... since I had four boys...

142
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:22,992
Here.

143
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:40,711
It's perfect.

144
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:45,791
Kevin's been coming to the church
since he was about yea high.

145
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:48,838
When I first met you, Monica,

146
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:53,277
I was struck by your honesty
and your devotion to Kevin.

147
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:56,079
When I asked him what
he loved most about you, he said,

148
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:58,470
"Because what you see
is what you get. "

149
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:01,077
With that being said,

150
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:04,391
you've got the rings,
you've vowed your vows...

151
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:08,517
...and I now pronounce you
husband and wife.

152
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:31,873
Thanks, Mom.

153
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:53,238
Step.

154
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:32,796
I'll give you two some privacy.

155
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:42,072
Hey. You OK?

156
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:45,635
Yeah. You?

157
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:49,834
Yeah, I'm... I'm great.

158
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:54,317
Where are they keeping you?

159
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:57,909
Outside. In a cage.

160
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:03,240
- Sawyer?
- He's in a cage too.

161
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,275
They're making us work.

162
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:10,237
Work? On what?

163
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:13,028
I don't know what it is, but it's big.

164
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:20,079
- We're hauling rocks, and...
- Hey...

165
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:22,949
...did they hurt you?

166
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:30,198
Kate, hey.

167
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:33,395
Hey, it's gonna be all right.

168
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:35,432
It's gonna...

169
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:38,071
Jack.

170
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:41,152
- You have to do it.
- What?

171
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:44,312
This thing that they told you to do,
this operation.

172
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:50,311
- She said, if you do it, they would...
- What'd they do to you?

173
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:52,197
- What did they do to you?
- Nothing.

174
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:54,714
How did they get you to ask me?
What did they offer?

175
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,438
- Nothing.
- Then why are you here?

176
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:59,353
They're gonna kill Sawyer.

177
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:05,238
I'm sorry.

178
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:13,270
I'm so sorry, but she said that if you
do it and do it soon, they'll let us go.

179
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:16,754
And you believe them?

180
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:21,072
I have to.

181
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:29,917
Jack?

182
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:32,638
Please.

183
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:35,198
We're done here.

184
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:37,554
- Jack...
- Hey!

185
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,791
<i>We're done in here.</i>

186
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:45,271
<i>Jack, I'm sorry. You have to do this.</i>

187
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:47,157
<i>They said that they couldn't...</i>

188
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:52,837
Get her out of there.

189
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:54,759
<i>Jack!</i>

190
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:57,958
<i>Jack, please.</i>

191
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:18,554
- Hey, you.
- Hey, what's for dinner, gorgeous?

192
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:21,594
- It's taco night.
- You're making tacos?

193
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:25,116
Yes. And you better like 'em.

194
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,195
- Or what?
- Or no dessert.

195
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:32,792
- I'm leaving now, I'll be home soon.
- Love you.

196
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:34,472
I love you too.

197
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:05,957
Agent Mars.

198
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:08,358
It's me.

199
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,676
I'm glad.

200
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,276
I realized it was the Feast
of the Ascension and I was feeling bad.

201
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:25,113
Lot of holy days have come
and gone since you last called.

202
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:28,715
- I thought you and I were friends.
- I don't wanna run anymore.

203
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:30,074
What's his name?

204
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:36,031
Does he know who you are?

205
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:39,197
Edward, please.

206
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:42,511
I know you don't want to spend
the rest of your life chasing me.

207
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:45,876
Please, I love this guy.
Just let me go.

208
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:48,553
I'll tell you what...

209
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:53,151
...if you can really stay put...

210
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:56,397
...really settle down...

211
00:18:57,560 --> 00:18:59,596
...then I'll stop chasing you.

212
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:08,195
But you and I both know
that's not gonna happen.

213
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:31,593
Sawyer...

214
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:35,238
...you really care about him?

215
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:38,675
Where is he?

216
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:42,199
I'm sorry you weren't able
to help us, Kate.

217
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:43,838
Move it, Ford.

218
00:19:57,320 --> 00:19:58,514
Danny.

219
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:00,751
- Danny!
- You son of a bitch!

220
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:06,279
Right. Sorry, Jules.

221
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:11,513
You got anything you want
to say to your girl...

222
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:13,956
...you best say it tonight.

223
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:33,719
And how was your day, honey?

224
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:38,792
When the hatch exploded,

225
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:41,713
your prayer stick fell out of a tree,
right on top of me.

226
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:44,113
So Sayid and I went to get it

227
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:46,794
because it didn't feel right
to bury you without it.

228
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:51,278
I'd like to think
you died for a reason, Mr Eko.

229
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:56,469
Just hope it's not too long before
we find out what the heck it might be.

230
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:11,759
Rest in peace, Mr Eko.

231
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:16,310
And thank you for helping me find my...

232
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,911
I saw Jack.

233
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:41,509
They brought me in to see him.

234
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:45,000
- They want him to do surgery on Ben.
- Who's Ben?

235
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:47,038
Henry, the guy who brought us in.

236
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:51,470
He's sick. And they say if he does it,
they're gonna let us all go.

237
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:54,518
- And you and me are what, bait?
- Something like that.

238
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:58,755
At least the doc ain't
dumb enough to do it.

239
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,309
I told him he had to.

240
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:05,077
Why would you do
something so stupid?

241
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:08,152
- To save your life.
- My life don't need saving.

242
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:10,879
You wanna die?
'Cause that's what's gonna happen!

243
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:15,352
Pickett is waiting for his chance.
I've seen him look at you.

244
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:17,351
Damn it, Freckles, stay put!

245
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:19,237
And you know what he's gonna do.

246
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:21,709
So don't pretend...

247
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:23,119
...like you don't care.

248
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:26,909
- Get down, we've been through this!
- Shut up, James.

249
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:36,749
You don't want Jack to save your life?
Then you're gonna save your own.

250
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:38,831
We're getting out of here, now.

251
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:40,194
Stop it! Damn it, Kate!

252
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:47,756
- Go! Get out of here! Run!
- You're out of your cage.

253
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:49,592
Why don't you run, Kate?

254
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:51,989
Because me, I ain't running...

255
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:55,916
...because there ain't no place to go.

256
00:22:58,160 --> 00:23:00,151
What're you talking about?

257
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:02,399
We ain't on our island.

258
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:06,430
We're on another island, like Alcatraz,
a couple miles off shore.

259
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:10,154
So unless you're a mermaid
or you got a boat...

260
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:13,556
...there ain't no point.

261
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:16,076
When were you planning
on telling me this?

262
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:18,196
- Never.
- Why not?

263
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:20,475
Why wouldn't you?

264
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:27,996
'Cause I wanted you to believe
that we had a damn chance.

265
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:52,353
- What was that for?
- I don't know.

266
00:23:58,360 --> 00:24:00,157
I don't know.

267
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:11,192
Very nice.

268
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:14,438
OK, now it's your turn.

269
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:17,917
Look under your place mat.

270
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:20,437
- What did you do?
- Just look.

271
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:23,429
What is it?

272
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:25,988
You know that honeymoon
I've been promising you?

273
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:29,390
You are holding in your hand
two tickets to Costa Rica.

274
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:31,755
So get your passport ready, baby.

275
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:35,553
Hey...

276
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:39,158
...what's wrong?

277
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:42,111
Nothing.

278
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:45,396
I just love you so much.

279
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:50,712
Come here.

280
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:22,431
Let me ask you something, Freckles.

281
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:28,229
The day Blockhead was beatin' on me...

282
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:30,788
...and you said,

283
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:32,279
"I love you,"

284
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:33,713
that was just to...

285
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:37,438
...get him to stop, right?

286
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:13,072
I love you too.

287
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:42,992
Who is this?

288
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:46,316
Hello?

289
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:48,432
Hello!

290
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:52,477
<i>Try it. The door.</i>

291
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:24,870
If it helps, I was surprised too.

292
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:28,195
If I were a betting man,

293
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:30,669
- I would have picked her and you.
- Shut up!

294
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:36,556
Well...

295
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:40,758
...this would be the proverbial
nail in my coffin, wouldn't it?

296
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:51,038
Tomorrow.

297
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,956
- Sorry?
- Tomorrow morning.

298
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:55,871
First thing.

299
00:29:57,920 --> 00:30:00,434
And everything I mentioned before.

300
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:03,592
The instruments, anaesthesia.
Someone who can hold a clamp.

301
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:05,398
Yes. Of course.

302
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:08,074
I'll get it out. Your tumour.

303
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:10,511
And I'll keep you alive.

304
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:18,470
But I need your word.

305
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:22,199
I need what you
promised me before.

306
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:25,554
I need to get the hell off this island.

307
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:32,429
Done.

308
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:33,749
What you working on?

309
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:37,116
Just finishing some IRs on that
fugitive recovery out of Tampa.

310
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:41,113
That's what being a cop is,
endless paperwork. Thank you, sweetie.

311
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:49,516
What if I told you
I was a fugitive?

312
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:56,513
What if I told you I was
on the run for blowing up my father,

313
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:59,751
and it was only a matter of time
before you found out.

314
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:03,268
- This isn't funny.
- It's not a joke.

315
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:06,631
I almost had a baby, Kevin.

316
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:08,990
Me! A baby!

317
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:12,276
I can't do this.

318
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:15,989
- Taco night? I don't do taco night!
- OK, calm down, Monica.

319
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:17,718
My name's not Monica!

320
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,752
I love you.

321
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:30,558
But I can't stay.

322
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:36,438
No, wait, hang on.

323
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:43,677
- Something's wrong with me.
- I drugged you.

324
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:45,193
- You what?
- I had to.

325
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:47,271
Otherwise they would think you knew.

326
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:50,591
People are gonna ask questions,
I didn't want you to lose your job.

327
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:32,795
This is gonna be
a very tricky procedure.

328
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:36,839
If I tell you to do something,
I need you to do it, no questions asked.

329
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:38,751
Is that understood?

330
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:42,913
You may find this hard to believe,
but I'm very good at following orders.

331
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:47,110
Is that a yes?

332
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:48,428
Yes.

333
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:52,312
Good. Let's go.

334
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:04,832
Do you get nervous?

335
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:08,517
Before you do surgery?

336
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:11,558
I used to. But not anymore, no.

337
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,911
Whatever happens...

338
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:28,037
...everything will be
very different, won't it?

339
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:29,712
No doubt about it.

340
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:36,113
Juliet...

341
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:39,318
...did Alex ask about me?

342
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:41,559
No.

343
00:34:41,640 --> 00:34:43,551
We took her home last night.

344
00:34:43,640 --> 00:34:45,471
I don't know where she is now.

345
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:48,834
Well, see ya on the other side.

346
00:34:55,240 --> 00:34:56,878
I'm ready.

347
00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:00,115
I need you to count down from 20.

348
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:02,833
Twenty...

349
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:05,118
...19...

350
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:08,028
...18...

351
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:13,912
Scalpel.

352
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:31,517
Let's go.

353
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:38,396
- Ben's just gone into surgery.
- Ben put his life in the hands of them.

354
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:40,755
Shephard wasn't even on Jacob's list.

355
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:46,871
- Sawyer. Sawyer!
- Well, look who got out of her cage.

356
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:48,916
Should've run when you had the chance.

357
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:52,072
- Let's go, James.
- Don't! You don't have to do this!

358
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:56,039
He's coming with me. There's
nothing you can do about it! Step away.

359
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:03,317
Give me another haemostat.

360
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:22,398
Swab again.

361
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:28,319
Clamp.

362
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:50,638
- What happened? Is he OK?
- His blood pressure's dropping.

363
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:54,512
- Should he be bleeding like that?
- Nope. No, he shouldn't.

364
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:58,188
Back away from the table.

365
00:36:58,280 --> 00:37:00,191
Back away from the table! Now!

366
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:15,428
- Can you hear me in there?
- Yeah.

367
00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:17,633
Good.

368
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:20,917
I just made a small incision
in Ben's kidney sack.

369
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,753
Now, if I don't stitch that back up
in the next hour...

370
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:26,519
...he's dead.

371
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:32,440
Now get in here
and bring that walkie-talkie.

372
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:34,598
- Step away!
- No!

373
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:49,514
You let go or I do her too.

374
00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:54,029
- Let go.
- Don't you let go!

375
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:59,598
Don't even think about it, Sawyer!
You fight!

376
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:01,113
No! No!

377
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:03,591
Sawyer! No!

378
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,195
No! No!

379
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:10,157
Sawyer, please!
You get your hands off of him!

380
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:11,639
Get down on your knees.

381
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:16,238
Please! I will do anything you want!

382
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:18,197
I want you to watch.

383
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:21,749
- Close your eyes, Freckles.
- Stand up!

384
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:23,951
Close your eyes!

385
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:28,796
Don't you give up!

386
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:31,759
No! No! No!

387
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:35,511
This is for Colleen,

388
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:36,874
you son of a bitch!

389
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:51,073
<i>Danny! You there? Pick it up!
Pick it up, Danny! Pick it up, damn it!</i>

390
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:54,275
I'm here. What?

391
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:56,112
<i>You anywhere near the cages?</i>

392
00:38:57,320 --> 00:38:58,639
Yeah. You could say that.

393
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:02,110
- Give your walkie to Kate.
- Now, why the hell would I do that?

394
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:10,117
Because if you don't,
the doctor's gonna let Ben die.

395
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:12,555
What are you talking about?
What's beeping?

396
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:14,915
Just hand her the damn walkie, Danny!

397
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:20,431
Do it. Just do it now!

398
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:28,799
Let go of her.

399
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:32,192
Jack?

400
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:33,713
<i>Jack!</i>

401
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:48,714
Kate, you have about an hour head start
before they come after you.

402
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:53,800
Wait, where are you? Where are you?

403
00:39:56,440 --> 00:39:59,830
Do you remember what I told you
on the beach, the day of the crash?

404
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:03,515
Do you remember what story I told you
when you were stitching me up?

405
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:07,950
- Do you remember it?!
- Yes! Yes! I remember!

406
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:15,393
When you get safe,
you radio me and you tell me that story.

407
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:19,077
Jack, please.

408
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:25,753
If you don't call in the next hour, I'll
know something went wrong and he dies!

409
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:31,794
- I can't leave without you!
- Yes you are. Go.

410
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:33,916
- Jack, I can't!
- Go! Now!

411
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,753
- I can't!
- Kate! Damn it! Run!
