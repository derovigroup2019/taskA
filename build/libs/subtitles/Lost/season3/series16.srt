00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:02,500
???

3
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:05,300
???

4
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:08,600
???? ALL THE WAY TO PORTLAND

5
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:10,600
FOR RESEARCH
THAT DOESN'T EVEN WORK?

6
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:13,200
BECAUSE IT DOES WORK.
M PREGNANT.

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
MY WHOLE LIFE, ALL I'VE EVER
WANTED WAS TO HAVE A BABY,

8
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:20,900
I KNOW THAT YOU DON'T CARE,
BUT THE PEOPLE

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,900
I SPENT THE LAST THREE YEARS OF
MY LIFE WITH--THEY JUST LEFT ME.

10
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:26,400
YOU OKAY?
YEAH.

11
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:28,900
SHE IS NOT COMING WITH US.
YES, SHE IS.

12
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:31,200
WHY?
BECAUSE THEY LEFT HER BEHIND,
TOO.

13
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:08,500
IT'S GETTING LATE.

14
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:11,000
THIS IS A GOOD PLACE
TO MAKE CAMP.

15
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:19,400
I'LL GET SOME FIREWOOD.

16
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:20,500
I'LL GO WITH YOU.

17
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:47,400
DO YOU WANNA TALK ABOUT IT?

18
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,300
TALK ABOUT WHAT?

19
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:54,700
ABOUT THE WEEK
YOU SPENT OVER THERE WITH THEM.

20
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:58,500
WELL, AFTER YOU LEFT,

21
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:00,200
I'D, UH...

22
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:03,000
I'D MADE A DEAL WITH THEM--
IF I TOOK CARE OF BEN,

23
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:04,800
THAT THEY'D
LET ME OFF THE ISLAND.

24
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:06,900
I DON'T KNOW.
I JUST KEPT MY HEAD DOWN,

25
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,300
DID WHAT I WAS SUPPOSED TO,

26
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:11,000
AND I DIDN'T
ASK ANY QUESTIONS.

27
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:15,100
AND THAT'S IT?

28
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,400
THAT'S IT.

29
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:40,600
OKAY. LET'S HAVE IT.

30
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:46,000
I WANT TO KNOW WHAT YOU PEOPLE
ARE DOING ON THIS ISLAND,

31
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:48,100
WHY YOU'RE TERRORIZING US,

32
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:51,500
MAKING LISTS,
KIDNAPPING CHILDREN.

33
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:55,000
I WANT TO KNOW EVERYTHING.

34
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:58,500
BUT THE FIRST THING
I'D LIKE TO KNOW IS...

35
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:01,200
WHO ARE YOU?

36
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:08,500
 <i>(Petula Clark's</i>

37
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:19,800

00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:22,100

THANK YOU.

39
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:24,500
WOW.
(both laugh)

40
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:27,800
I THINK THEY'RE TAKING THIS

41
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:30,600
WHOLE "CORPORATE SECRECY" THING
A LITTLE TOO SERIOUSLY.

42
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:32,700
I'M NEVER GONNA FIT IN
WITH THESE PEOPLE.

43
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:35,100
(knock on window)

44
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:37,200
HEY THERE, DR. BURKE.

45
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:39,700
IF YOU POP THE TRUNK,
I'LL GET YOUR BAGS.
THANK YOU.

46
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:43,400

47
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:44,600
HEY.

48
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:47,700
AH, YOU MANAGED TO FIND US.

49
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:51,000
I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW
THEY HAD AN AIRPORT OUT HERE.
I KNOW. IT SURPRISES EVERYONE.

50
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:54,900
HI. YOU MUST BE RACHEL.
RICHARD ALPERT.
NICE TO MEET YOU.

51
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,800
THANK YOU FOR LETTING US BORROW
YOUR SISTER FOR A FEW MONTHS.

52
00:03:57,900 --> 00:03:59,800
JUST PROMISE ME YOU'LL
BRING HER BACK IN ONE PIECE.

53
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:01,300
WELL, WE'LL DO OUR BEST.

54
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:05,000
UM, SO LISTEN, IT'S A...
A SECURITY THING, YOU KNOW?

55
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:07,800
WE HAVE TO TAKE YOU IN
THE REST OF THE WAY, SO...

56
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,400
WHENEVER YOU'RE READY,
WE'LL BE WAITING

57
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:12,600
RIGHT OVER HERE, BUT PLEASE TAKE
YOUR TIME. PLEASURE TO MEET YOU.

58
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:13,900
THANKS.
THANK YOU.

59
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:22,700
IT'S BETTER THIS WAY.

60
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,300
IS THIS A MISTAKE?

61
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:26,400
I SHOULDN'T GO.
WHAT IF YOU GET SICK AGAIN?

62
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:28,000
I WON'T.
THE CANCER'S GONE,

63
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:32,100
AND I'M 100% PREGGERS,
THANKS TO YOU.

64
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:34,900
I'LL BE BACK...
YES, I KNOW.

65
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,500
BEFORE YOU GIVE BIRTH.
I PROMISE.

66
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:39,900
I KNOW. DON'T WORRY
ABOUT US, OKAY?
OKAY.

67
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:43,100
YOU SPENT YOUR WHOLE LIFE
WORKING TO GET HERE,

68
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:45,400
SO DON'T BLOW IT.

69
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:46,500
(laughs)

70
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:51,600
I LOVE YOU.
(whispers) I LOVE YOU.
(blows kiss)

71
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
OKAY.
GO MAKE US PROUD.

72
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:03,500
(gate rattling)

73
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:06,100
MA'AM...

74
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:09,600

75
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:19,300
WHO <i>ARE</i> YOU?

76
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,800
IF I TOLD YOU WHO I WAS,

77
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,900
IF I TOLD YOU
EVERYTHING THAT I KNOW,

78
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:31,800
YOU'D KILL ME.

79
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:35,800
WHAT DO YOU THINK I'LL DO
IF YOU DON'T?

80
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:38,000
(firewood clatters)

81
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:39,100
(Jack) LEAVE HER ALONE.

82
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,900
SOONER OR LATER,
SHE'LL ANSWER MY QUESTIONS.

83
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:48,800
SHE'LL ANSWER YOUR QUESTIONS
WHEN SHE'S READY,

84
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,700
AND YOU'LL WAIT UNTIL SHE IS.

85
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,100
SHE'S UNDER MY PROTECTION.

OH, OH, WHAT IS IT?

OH, IT'S OKAY.
SHUSH. I KNOW.

WHAT'S--WHAT'S GOING ON?

100
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:13,500
DIDN'T YOU HEAR AARON?
IS HE OKAY?

101
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:16,700
NO, HE'S OKAY, HE'S OKAY.
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

102
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:20,000
YEAH, I JUST...
I JUST FEEL A LITTLE BIT OFF.

103
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:21,700
I DIDN'T SLEEP WELL.

104
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:23,800
I CAN'T BELIEVE
I DIDN'T HEAR HIM CRYING.

105
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:25,300
WELL, MAYBE YOU'RE COMING DOWN
WITH SOMETHING.

106
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:27,800
BUT WHY DON'T YOU LET ME
TAKE AARON,

107
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:31,300
AND YOU GET SOME MORE REST?
YEAH. DO YOU MIND?

108
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:33,400
ABSOLUTELY. HEY.

109
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:36,500
(moans)
I WON'T SLEEP... LONG.

110
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:51,700
(Juliet) I GUESS IT'S NO USE
ASKING THEM TO WAIT UP, HUH?

111
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:55,500
THEY'LL COME AROUND.
JUST GIVE THEM SOME TIME.

112
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:59,000
MY PEOPLE KEPT SAYID CHAINED
TO A SWING SET FOR THREE DAYS.

113
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:00,900
THEN I DRAGGED KATE
INTO THE JUNGLE,

114
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,800
HANDCUFFED MYSELF TO HER
AND LIED ABOUT IT.

115
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:05,900
HOW MUCH TIME
DO YOU THINK THEY NEED?

116
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:09,700
WE'LL BE BACK TO OUR BEACH
 A COUPLE HOURS.

117
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:11,100
THEY'LL PROBABLY
BE OVER IT BY THEN.

118
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:15,600
YOU NERVOUS?

119
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:17,200
HELL, YES.

120
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,500
I KNOW THAT, UH, SIX MONTHS
SOUNDS LIKE AN ETERNITY,

121
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:24,900
BUT YOU'RE
GONNA BE AMAZED

122
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,400
AT HOW TIME FLIES
ONCE YOU'RE THERE.

123
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:28,200
I CAN'T WAIT TO FIND OUT
WHERE "THERE" IS.

124
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:31,100
(Ethan) DR. BURKE,
WANNA HAVE A SEAT?

125
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:32,600
I'D LIKE TO TAKE
SOME OF YOUR VITALS,

126
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:34,900
IF THAT'S OKAY WITH YOU.

127
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:37,000
D@G@, SURE.

128
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:42,800
EVERYONE AT THE COMPANY
IS REALLY EXCITED

129
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:44,500
ABOUT YOU COMING DOWN,
DR. BURKE,

130
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:45,900
AND I THINK YOUR RESEARCH

131
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,300
IS REALLY GONNA HAVE
A MAJOR IMPACT ON US.

132
00:08:57,801 --> 00:08:58,699
WHAT IS THAT?

133
00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:01,500
THAT IS ORANGE JUICE
WITH A CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT

134
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:02,800
OF TRANQUILIZER MIXED IN.

135
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:05,600
YOU WANT ME TO DRINK IT?

136
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:08,400
OH, YES. YOU'RE GONNA WANT TO BE
ASLEEP FOR THE TRIP, DR. BURKE.

137
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:10,200
IT CAN BE
KIND OF INTENSE.

138
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:15,600
O-OKAY. I OKS FINE WITH SIGNINGALL OF YO

139
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:17,400
FINE WITH AGREEING TO <i>NOT</i> TALK

140
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:19,200
TO ANYONE IN MY LIFE
FOR SIX MONTHS,

141
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:21,500
FINE WITH THE FACT THAT NO ONE
IN THE MEDICAL COMMUNITY

142
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:24,300
HAS EVER HEARD
OF MITTELOS BIOSCIENCE--
WHY WERE YOU FINE?

143
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,800
WHAT?
WHY WERE YOU FINE
WITH THOSE THINGS?

144
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:30,900
IT SEEMS LIKE QUITE A LEAP
FOR A JOB OPPORTUNITY,

145
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:33,200
AND WE'RE NOT
PAYING YOU <i>THAT</i> MUCH.

146
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:39,000
I THINK YOU'RE FINE BECAUSE
DEEP DOWN, A PART OF YOU KNOWS

147
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:42,000
THAT THE PLACE
WE'RE TAKING YOU TO IS SPECIAL.

148
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,400
SPECIAL, HUH?

149
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:47,700
LET ME ASK YOU SOMETHING,
JULIET.

150
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:52,600
YOU TOOK A WOMAN--
YOUR OWN SISTER--

151
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:56,100
WHOSE REPRODUCTIVE SYSTEM
WAS RAVAGED BY CHEMOTHERAPY,

152
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:59,300
S STERILE,
AND YOU MADE HER PREGNANT.

153
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:02,400
YOU CREATED LIFE WHERE
LIFE WASN'T SUPPOSED TO BE.

154
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:05,100
THAT'S A GIFT, JULIET.

155
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,100
YOU HAVE A GIFT.

156
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:08,900
NOW DON'T YOU FEEL

157
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,200
YOU'RE MEANT TO DO SOMETHING
SIGNIFICANT WITH IT?

158
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,400
WHERE WE'RE GOING,
YOU CAN DO JUST THAT.

159
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:21,500
WHERE EXACTLY
ARE WE GOING?

160
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:22,900
I CAN'T TELL YOU THAT,

161
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:25,100
BUT WHAT I <i>CAN</i> TELL YOU

162
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,800
IS THAT
YOU'LL SEE THINGS THERE

163
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:29,400
THAT YOU NEVER IMAGINED.

164
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:35,600
NOW NO ONE IS FORCING YOU
TO DO ANYTHING,

165
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:36,900
SO IF YOU CHANGE YOUR MIND,

166
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,300
WE'RE HAPPY
TO TAKE YOU BACK TO--

167
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:49,500
UM, YOU PROBABLY SHOULDN'T
HAVE DRUNK THAT SO FAST.

168
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:09,500
GOOD MORNING.
(gasping)

169
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:13,700
NO, NO, IT'S OKAY. YOU'LL BE
HOARSE FOR A FEW HOURS,

170
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:15,400
BUT IT GETS BETTER
ASHE DAY GOES ON.

171
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,300
SORRY I HAD TO STRAP YOU IN,

172
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:19,500
BUT THE LAST LEG
IS ALWAYS A LITTLE BUMPY.

173
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:23,000
WATCH YOUR HEAD.
GIVE ME YOUR HAND.

174
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:45,600
WE'RE HERE.

175
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:47,500
(hoarsely) HERE WHERE?

176
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,900
(birds chirping in distance)

177
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:52,200
HELLO, DR. BURKE.

178
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:56,700
MY NAME
IS BENJAMIN LINUS.

179
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,600
I'M REALLY LOOKING FORWARD
TO WORKING WITH YOU.

180
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:05,200
WATCH YOUR STEP HERE.

181
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:18,300
HEY, WHOA,
THAT'S TOO MUCH WAR.

182
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:19,300
IT'S GONNA BE ALL SOGGY.

183
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:21,500
IT'S OATMEAL, DUDE.
IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE SOGGY.

184
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:24,400
WELL, IF IT AIN'T
THREE MEN AND A BABY.

185
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,200
I COUNTED HUGO TWICE.

186
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:31,200
OH, WHAT?
COME ON. I USED YOUR NAME.

187
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:36,500
HEY...

188
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:39,200
DOES ANYBODY KNOW
WHERE THERE'S ANY ASPIRIN?

189
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:40,500
CLAIRE,
YOU DON'T LOOK SO GOOD.

190
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:43,000
HEY, WHAT ARE YOU DOING UP?
YOU'RE MEANT TO BE IN BED.

191
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:46,600
YEAH, NO, I KNOW.
I JUST... MY HEAD IS POUNDING.

192
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:49,200
I GOT YOU COVERED.
TWO ASPIRIN COMING RIGHT UP.

193
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:50,600
THANK YOU.

194
00:13:58,700 --> 00:14:01,500
(woman)
CAN YOU GIVE ME A HAND?
(man) YEAH. I'LL BE RIGHT THERE.

195
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:03,000
(under breath)
SON OF A BITCH.

196
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:09,500
JACK. IT'S JACK!

197
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:19,500
(woman) COME ON! COME ON!
IT'S JACK!

198
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:21,100
IT'S JACK.

199
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:46,800
(Sun) SAYID!

200
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:49,600
HURLEY!

201
00:14:59,000 --> 00:14:59,800
DOC.

202
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:00,800
ALL RIGHT.

203
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:04,400
HEY.

204
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:35,700
WHAT THE HELL
IS <i>SHE</i> DOING HERE?

205
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:59,500
HEY.

206
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:04,500
SO...

207
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:07,900
YOU'RE, LIKE,
ONE OF THEM, HUH?

208
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:10,100
I'M JULIET.

209
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:14,800
I DON'T REMEMBER YOU
FROM THE DOCK...

210
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:17,900
WHERE YOU PUT
BAGS ON OUR HEADS...

211
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:20,600
AFTER YOU SHOCKED US.

212
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,000
I HAD THE DAY OFF.

213
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:34,400
SO I HEAR
YOU'RE A DOCTOR.

214
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:36,900
I'M REALLY
MORE OF A RESEARCHER.

215
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:39,100
UH-HUH.

216
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:47,200
THEY SEND YOU OVER HERE
TO KEEP AN EYE ON ME?

217
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:49,300
OKAY.

218
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:53,600
THE LAST ONE OF YOU GUYS
THAT CAME OVER HERE--ETHAN...

219
00:16:56,600 --> 00:17:00,400
HE KIDNAPPED CLAIRE,
AND CHARLIE GOT UPSET.

220
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,200
WE BURIED HIM OVER THERE.

221
00:17:24,100 --> 00:17:25,300
(man)
GO AHEAD AND DISCONNECT.

222
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:32,400
SHE'S GONE, JULIET.
SHE'S DEAD.

223
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:41,700
IT'S OKAY. YOU TRIED.

224
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:43,500
(man) I'LL GET THE TRAY.

225
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:46,300
(woman) DISASSEMBLE.

226
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:49,900
WHY DON'T YOU GO AHEAD
AND TAKE OFF?

227
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:52,700
I'LL TALK TO BEN.

228
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:10,500
(waves crashing loudly)

229
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:12,700
IT WAS SABINE'S OICE
TO GET PREGNANT.

230
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:21,700
SHE KNEW
SHE WAS TAKING A RISK.

231
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:24,900
I THINK IT HAPPENS
AT CONCEPTION,

232
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:26,900
AND IF THAT'S THE CASE,

233
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,200
THERE'S NOTHING I CAN DO
ABOUT IT,

234
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:30,700
AT LEAST NOT HERE.
I'M NOT SURE I UNDERSTAND.

235
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:32,100
THE ONLY WAY TO SEE
IF I'M RIGHT

236
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:34,700
IS TO TAKE A WOMAN OFF
THE ISLAND, BACK TO MIAMI.

237
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:37,000
NO. YOU'RE NOT TAKING
ANYBODY OFF THE ISLAND.

238
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:45,300
IN THAT CASE,
THERE'S THING MORE I CAN DO.

239
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:48,300
I KNOW YOU PUT
A LOT OFAITH IN ME, BEN,

240
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:50,800
AND I'M SORRY
I COULDN'T HELP YOU.

241
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,000
MY SISTER'S GIVING BIRTH
IN THREE MONTHS...

242
00:18:57,100 --> 00:18:59,200
AND I HAVEN'T EVEN
BEEN ABLE TO CALL HER.

243
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:04,200
IT'S TIME FOR ME
TO GO HOME.

244
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:13,300
YOUR SISTER WON'T BE GIVING
BIRTH IN THREE MONTHS, JULIET.

245
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,600
SHE'LL BE DEAD BEFORE THEN.

246
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:20,900
HER CANCER'S BACK.

247
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:48,900
WHERE DID YOU GET THIS?
MIKHAIL. I'M SORRY.
I SHOULD HAVE TOLD YOU SOONER.

248
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,200
I JUST DIDN'T SEE
WHAT GOOD IT WOULD DO--

249
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:52,300
WHAT GOOD IT WOULD DO?!
COULD HAVE GONE HOME!

250
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:54,200
I COULD HAVE BEEN WITH HER!
YOU STILL CAN.

251
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:58,700
YOU CAN GO HOME, JULIET,
BE WITH HER IN HER FINAL DAYS,

252
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:01,900
OR YOU CAN STAY HERE
AND HELP ME WITH OUR PROBLEM.

253
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,400
WHY WOULD I STAY?

254
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:07,700
BECAUSE IF YOU DO, I WILL CURE
YOUR SISTER'S CANCER.

255
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:11,700
I'M SUPPOSED
TO TAKE THAT ON FAITH?

256
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:12,900
YOU'VE BEEHERE
FOR SIX MONTHS.

257
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:14,900
YOU'VE DONE EXTENSIVE WORKUPS
ON ALL OF US.

258
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:18,100
HAVE YOU SEEN
EVEN A TRACE OF CANCER?
THAT'S <i>HERE,</i>

259
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:21,000
AND BEING THAT YOU WON'T
LET ME BRING MY SISTER HERE,

260
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:23,300
I'M GONNA NEED MORE--
JACOB SAID HE WOULD
TAKE CARE OF IT HIMSELF.

261
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,900
UNLESS, OF COURSE,
YOU DON'T HAVE FAITH IN <i>HIM.</i>

262
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:31,100
EVERY WOMAN ON THIS ISLAND
NEEDS YOU.

263
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:33,500
IF YOU CHOOSE TO STAY,

264
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:35,600
I PROMISE YOU,

265
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:37,700
WE WILL SAVE
RACHEL'S LIFE.

266
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:47,300
TRUST HER?
SHE'S ONE OF THEM.

267
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:49,000
NOT ANYMORE.
THEY LEFT HER BEHIND.

268
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:51,400
OH, YEAH? WHERE'D THEY GO?
I TOLD YOU. I DON'T KNOW.

269
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:54,100
MAYBE WE BETTER ASK HER.
(Jack) SHE DOESN'T KNOW EITHER.

270
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:57,200
HERE'S A WACKY IDEA. LET'S SIC
OUR RESIDENT IRAQI ON HER,

271
00:20:57,500 --> 00:21:00,600
LET HIM DO WHAT HE DOES,
THEN SEE WHAT SHE SAYS.
NO. I DON'T DO THAT ANYMORE.

272
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:02,200
WELL,
AIN'T THAT CONVENIENT?

273
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,800
BUT I DON'T TRUST HER, JACK.
IF SHE'S SO INNOCENT...

274
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:07,400
HEY.
WHY WON'T SHE ANSWER
OUR QUESTIONS?

275
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:10,200
JUST GIVE HER SOME TIME.
SHE'S AFRAID.
HOW MUCH TIME?

276
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:14,000
(Jack) LOOK, THE FACT THAT
I TRUST HER SHOULD BE ENOUGH.
IT'S NOT.

277
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:18,000
WHERE DID LOCKE GO?

278
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:21,000
HE WENT WITH THEM, RIGHT AFTER
HE DESTROYED THE SUB--

279
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:23,000
THE SUB THAT WAS GONNA TAKE <i>ME</i>
OFF THIS ISLAND.

280
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:24,800
WHAT?
THEY WERE GONNA LET YOU GO?

281
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:26,800
YEAH.
SAID WHO?

282
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:29,500
BEN.

283
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:30,900
BEN...

284
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:34,400
WHOSE LIFE YOU SAVED.
SAWYER, LAY OFF.

285
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:36,300
SHOULDA LET
THAT BUG-EYED BASTARD DIE.

286
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:38,700
HE DID IT FOR US.
SOUNDS LIKE
HE DID IT FOR HIM.

287
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:41,200
JAMES.
IS THERE SOMETHING
YOU WANNA ASK ME, SAWYER?

288
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:42,800
YEAH, JACK. I WANNA ASK YOU
WHY YOU'RE FIGHTING

289
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:44,700
EVERY SINGLE ONE OF US
AND STICKING UP FOR ONE OF THEM?

290
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:48,500
LOOK, I SPENT EVERY MOMENT
OVER THERE TRYING TO FIND...
CLAIRE?

291
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:50,400
A WAY OFF THIS ISLAND.
I WAS TRYING TO HELP ALL OF US.

292
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:53,800
I WAS TRYING TO GET US RESCUED.
CLAIRE? JACK!

293
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:57,900
SOMETHING'S WRONG WITH CLAIRE!
(wan) OH, MY GOSH.

294
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,300
CLAIRE?
(man) IS SHE OKAY?

295
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:02,500
GRAB HER, GRAB HER.

296
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:04,300
LET'S GET HER UP.
LET'S GET HER UP.

297
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:07,500
CLAIRE? CLAIRE!
HOW LONG HAS SHE
BEEN LIKE THIS?

298
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:09,400
UH, SHE STARTED
FEELING BAD THIS MORNING.

299
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:12,000
BEFORE WE GOT BACK, WAS SHE
SHOWING ANY SYMPTOMS AT ALL?

300
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:15,000
NO, SHE WAS FINE.
WHAT ABOUT WATER? HAS SHE
BEEN DRINKING ENOUGH WATER?

301
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:17,500
I THINK SO, YEAH.
ALL RIGHT, KEEP THAT HEAD UP.

302
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:21,500
WHAT HAPPENED TO HER?

303
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:23,500
(speaking Korean)

304
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:26,600
HE SAID,
"WHAT DO <i>YOU</i> CARE?"

305
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:36,200
KATE! I NEED YOUR HELP.

306
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:37,800
I NEED YOU
TO GO AND GET JACK.

307
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:39,500
WELL, HE'S BUSY RIGHT NOW.

308
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:41,100
PLEASE,
I HAVE TO TALK TO HIM.

309
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:42,900
YOU WANNA TELL ME
WHY YOU NEED JACK?

310
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:47,100
BECAUSE I THINK I KNOW
WHAT'S WRONG WITH CLAIRE.

311
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:49,900
WHY?

312
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:52,900
BECAUSE I DID ITO HER.

313
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:23,400
GIVING YOU A BAD FEELING
IN YOUR STOMACH?

314
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:28,900
YEAH, ME, TOO.

315
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:31,700
CLAIRE'S IMMUNE SYSTEM
IS TURNING ON HER.

316
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:33,000
SHE'S HAVING
A LATENT REACTION

317
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:35,200
TO A MEDICATION
IN HER BLOODSTREAM.
WHAT MEDICATION?

318
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:36,900
IT WAS DESIGNED
TO KEEP HER ALIVE

319
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,600
DURING THE LATE STAGES
OF HER PREGNANCY.
DESIGNED BY WHO?

320
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:42,700
BY ME.

321
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:45,400
FOR SOME REASON THE WOMEN HERE
CAN'T HAVE BABIES.

322
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,200
THE MOER'S BODY
TURNS ON THE PREGNANCY,

323
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:49,800
TREATS IT
AS A FOREIGN INVADER.

324
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:52,200
I SAW IT HAPPEN
OVER AND OVER.

325
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:54,700
EVERY PREGNANT WOMAN
ON THIS ISLAND DIED...

326
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:01,600
THAT IS, EVERY PREGNANT WOMAN
UNTIL CLAIRE.

327
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:04,300
WHAT DID YOU DO TO HER?

328
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:09,200
ONE OF OUR PEOPLE
INFILTRATED YOUR CAMP

329
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:12,600
AND BEGAN TAKING
BLOOD SAMPLES

330
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:14,300
RIGHT AFTER
YOUR PLANE CRASHED.

331
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:17,300
AAH!

332
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:19,000
SHH.

333
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,000
ETHAN.

334
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:22,100
EVEN THOUGH CLAIRE DIDN'T
CONCEIVE ON THIS ISLAND,

335
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:23,800
WE FOUND THAT
HER SYMPTOMS WERE CONSISTENT

336
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:27,500
WITH PREVIOUS MOTHERS,
SO WE TRIED TO SAVE HER LIFE.
BY KIDNAPPING HER?

337
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:30,000
NO, THAT WASN'T
SUPPOSED TO HAPPEN.

338
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:34,300
SHE WAS OUR CONTROL CASE.
I HAD DEVELOPED A SERUM

339
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:37,300
THAT I THOUGHT WOULD REVERSE
WHAT WAS HAPPENING TO HER.

340
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:39,600
ETHAN WAS ADMINISTERING
THE INJECTIONS,

341
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:44,000
 <i>BUT THEN YOU FOUND OUT</i>
 <i>THAT HE WASN'T ON THE PLANE.</i>

342
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:46,400
THE CENSUS--
I INTERVIEWED EVERYONE.

343
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:48,200
ONE OF THEM
ISN'T IN THE MANIFEST.

344
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:50,200
HE WASN'T ON THEPLANE.

345
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:53,300
SO... HE IMPROVISED.

346
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:55,200
(Ethan) HELLO THERE.

347
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:01,600
(Juliet)
HE KIDNAPPED HER ON HIS OWN.

348
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:03,100
THAT WAS NEVER THE PLAN.
 <i>(Claire screams)</i>

349
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,500
LOOK,
I KNOW HOW THIS SOUNDS,

350
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:11,300
BUT WITHOUT THOSE INJECTIONS,
CLAIRE WOULD HAVE DIED.

351
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:15,600
THOUT THE SERUM, SHE'S GOING
INTO A FORM OF WITHDRAWAL,

352
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:17,400
AND IF I DON'T
TRT HER QUICKLY,

353
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:19,800
HER IMMUNE SYSTEM
COULD SHUT DOWN ENTIRELY.

354
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:24,000
JACK, I CAN FIX THIS.
I JUST NEED THE SERUM.

355
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:26,500
ETHAN KEPT A STASH
OF MEDICAL SUPPLIES

356
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:28,300
NEAR THE CAVES
WHERE YOU USED TO LIVE.

357
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:29,700
IF I GO RIGHT NOW,

358
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:31,900
I CAN BE BACK
BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE.

359
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:40,300
DO IT.

360
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:43,000
GET MOVING.

361
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:48,600
 <i>(opera music playing)</i>

362
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:50,900
(man) WHERE ARE YOU?

363
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:55,600
IN BED... WITH YOU.

364
00:25:58,900 --> 00:25:59,900
UH-HUH.

365
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:03,400
EN WHERE <i>WERE</i> YOU?

366
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:05,700
I WAS JUST REALIZING...

367
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:10,800
THAT TOMORROW I WILL HAVE BEEN
ON THIS ISLAND FOR THREE YEARS.

368
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:13,400
HMM. MWAH.

369
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:18,400
WELL... THEN I BETTER
BAKE A CAKE.

370
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:20,500
HMM.

371
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:22,200
(knock on door)

372
00:26:24,100 --> 00:26:25,100
STAY HERE.

373
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:39,900
WHAT HAVE YOU GOT THERE?

374
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:44,200
KARL DEVELOPED
SOME X-RAYS FOR ME.

375
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:47,100
WHAT'S WRONG?

376
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:51,500
(woman)
...TAKE THE LADDER?

377
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:53,600
(man) YEAH!

378
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:55,600
MORNING, JULIET.

379
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:58,200
(man) I'LL BRING IT BACK!
(woman) DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

380
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:06,600
HI.

381
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:07,600
CAN I COME IN?

382
00:27:08,301 --> 00:27:09,199
OF COURSE.

383
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:13,100
I WAS
JUST FINISHING "CARRIE."

384
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:14,700
I STILL DON'T KNOW
WHY YOU PICKED IT,

385
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:17,400
BUT, BOY, IS IT DEPRESSING.
YOU HAVE A TUMOR.

386
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:22,400
WHAT?
WHEN YOU TOLD ME
ABOUT YOUR BACK PAIN,

387
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:24,300
I SAID THAT I WOULD
TAKE SOME X-RAYS TO SEE

388
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:27,100
IF IT WAS A SMALL FRACTURE
OR A HERNIATED DISC,

389
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:29,000
BUT THAT'S NOT YOUR PROBLEM.

390
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:33,900
YOUR PROBLEM IS A LARGE TUMOR
SURROUNDING YOUR L4 VERTEBRA.

391
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:47,600
YOU'RE SURPRISED.

392
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:49,600
WELL, YOU'VE JUST TOLD ME
THAT I HAVE CANCER, JULIET.

393
00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:51,100
OF COURSE I'M SURPRISED.

394
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:53,000
NO, I TOLD YOU
THAT YOU HAD A TUMOR.

395
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:04,200
WHY ARE YOU SCARED?
I'M NOT SCARED.

396
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:06,500
WHY ARE YOU SCARED, BEN?

397
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:09,000
YOU SAID NO ONE ON THIS ISLAND
EVER HAD CANCER.

398
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:10,800
YOU TOLD ME AT--
I KNOW WHAT
I TOLD YOU, JULIET.

399
00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:12,300
YOU TOLD ME YOU COULD FIX IT.
YOU SAID THAT.

400
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:15,900
YOU SAID THAT YOU CURED
MY SISTER. YOU LIED TO ME.
NO, I DID NOT LIE TO YOU.

401
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,300
IF YOU CAN CURE CANCER, BEN,
THEN WHY DO YOU HAVE IT?

402
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:22,500
I DON'T KNOW.

403
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:23,900
(glass shatters)

404
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:26,300
I WANNA TALK TO HER.
I WANNA TALK TO RACHEL.

405
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:29,800
I WANNA TALK TO HER <i>NOW!</i>
THAT'S NOT
GONNA HAPPEN, JULIET,

406
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:31,700
BUT I CAN PROMISE YOU
THAT RACHEL IS FINE.

407
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:33,700
YOU NEVER CURED HER!
I DID!

408
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:35,600
YOU'RE A LIAR!
NO, JULIET--

409
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:36,700
YOU LIED TO ME!

410
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:37,800
I TOLD YOU THE TRUTH!

411
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:47,100
I GAVE YOU MY WORD.

412
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:03,100
PLEASE... I WANNA GO HOME.

413
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,300
I WANNA GO HOME, BEN.
PLEASE.

414
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:10,000
CAN'T YOU PLEASE
JUST LET ME GO HOME?

415
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:15,600
NO.

416
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:53,100
(Sayid)
STEP AWAY FROM THE CASE!

417
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:57,300
LISTEN TO ME, SAYID--
STEP BACK.

418
00:30:00,456 --> 00:30:03,327
IT'S FULL OF MEDICAL SUPPLIES.
THEY'RE FOR CLAIRE.

419
00:30:03,328 --> 00:30:04,240
JACK KNOWS ALL ABOUT IT.

420
00:30:04,241 --> 00:30:05,996
WELL, JACK AIN'T HERE
RIGHT NOW, IS HE?

421
00:30:11,443 --> 00:30:12,881
I'TELLING YOU THE TRUTH.

422
00:30:12,882 --> 00:30:15,264
YOU SAID EARLIER IF YOU TOLD ME
EVERYTHING YOU KNEW,

423
00:30:16,060 --> 00:30:17,155
I'D KILL YOU.

424
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:21,790
I'M GOING TO TEST THE VALIDITY
OF THAT STATEMENT.

425
00:30:21,802 --> 00:30:22,841
HE MEANS, "TALK."

426
00:30:23,332 --> 00:30:24,822
WE DON'T HAVE TIME FOR THIS.

427
00:30:24,823 --> 00:30:26,329
WE CLEARED OUR SCHEDULES.

428
00:30:26,988 --> 00:30:28,631
WE GOT ALL THE TIME
IN THE WORLD.

429
00:30:35,330 --> 00:30:36,674
YOU KNOW,
IT'S INTERESTING...

430
00:30:37,496 --> 00:30:40,144
THAT YOU TWO ARE NOW
THE CAMP'S MOR POLICE.

431
00:30:43,082 --> 00:30:45,497
I'M CURIOUS, SAYID.

432
00:30:46,651 --> 00:30:47,689
HOW LONG WAS IT

433
00:30:47,690 --> 00:30:49,384
BEFORE YOU TOLD
EVERYONE ON THAT BEACH

434
00:30:49,385 --> 00:30:52,071
EXACTLY HOW MANY PEOPLE
YOU'VE TORTURED IN YOUR LIFE?

435
00:30:54,228 --> 00:30:55,960
DO THEY KNOW ABOUT BASRA?

436
00:30:59,439 --> 00:31:01,118
AND I'M SURE
THE FIRST THING YOU DID

437
00:31:01,119 --> 00:31:03,541
WHEN YOU GOT HERE, <i>JAMES,</i>

438
00:31:03,669 --> 00:31:05,678
WAS TO GATHER EVERYONE
IN A CIRCLE

439
00:31:05,679 --> 00:31:07,603
AND TELL THEM ABOUT THE MAN
YOU SHOT IN COLD BLOOD

440
00:31:07,604 --> 00:31:09,263
THE NIGHT BEFORE
YOU GOT ON THE PLANE.

441
00:31:11,094 --> 00:31:13,615
SO WHY DON'T
WE JUST SKIP THE PART

442
00:31:13,616 --> 00:31:15,842
WHERE YOU TWO
PRETEND TO BE RIGHTEOUS?

443
00:31:17,411 --> 00:31:20,195
I'M TAKING THAT MEDICATION
BACK TO AIRE,

444
00:31:20,826 --> 00:31:22,189
AND YOU'RE GONNA LET ME,

445
00:31:23,180 --> 00:31:24,735
BECAUSE IF SHE DOESN'T GET IT,

446
00:31:24,736 --> 00:31:26,218
SHE'S GONNA DIE.

447
00:31:27,844 --> 00:31:29,623
AND THE LAST THING

448
00:31:29,729 --> 00:31:31,836
THAT EITHER OF YOU NEED
RIGHT NOW...

449
00:31:35,177 --> 00:31:36,813
IS MORE BLOOD ON YOUR HANDS.

450
00:32:53,137 --> 00:32:56,761
GOODWIN! ETHAN, THERE Y
ACTUALLY BE SURVIVORS,

451
00:32:56,762 --> 00:32:59,248
AND YOU'RE ONE OF 'EM--
A PASSENGER. YOU'RE IN SHOCK.

452
00:32:59,249 --> 00:33:01,783
LISTEN. LEARN.
DON'T GET INVOLVED.

453
00:33:01,784 --> 00:33:04,033
I WANT LISTS
IN THREE DAYS. GO.

454
00:33:13,390 --> 00:33:15,151
SO I GUESS I'M OUT
OF THE BOOK CLUB.

455
00:33:21,344 --> 00:33:23,901
JULIET. <i>JULIET.</i>

456
00:33:27,002 --> 00:33:28,420
I WAS LOOKING FOR YOU
THIS MORNING.

457
00:33:30,503 --> 00:33:31,910
YOU AND I NEED TO TALK.

458
00:33:31,911 --> 00:33:33,171
NOW?

459
00:33:33,172 --> 00:33:35,125
WE HAVE SOME TIME.
IT'S IMPORTANT.

460
00:33:38,491 --> 00:33:40,024
TAKE A WALK WITH ME.

461
00:33:50,163 --> 00:33:51,665
MIKHAIL, WE'RE HERE.

462
00:33:53,974 --> 00:33:55,172
HE NEVER
HAS HIS WALKIE ON.

463
00:33:55,173 --> 00:33:56,298
WHAT ARE WE DOING HERE?

464
00:33:56,299 --> 00:33:59,937
SOMETHING I NEED TO SHOW YOU.
MIKHAIL?!

465
00:34:01,084 --> 00:34:04,393
IT'S B!
I'M HERE WITH JULIET!

466
00:34:04,394 --> 00:34:07,360
WE'RE APPROACHING THE HOUSE!
DON'T SHOOT US.

467
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:09,229
(Mikhail)
WELL, HURRY UP, THEN!

468
00:34:13,348 --> 00:34:14,626
DID YOU SEE IT?

469
00:34:15,084 --> 00:34:17,125
A PLANE FELL OUT
OF THE SKY, MIKHAIL.

470
00:34:17,881 --> 00:34:18,994
OF COURSE WE SAW IT.

471
00:34:20,075 --> 00:34:21,204
WHAT DO YOU HAVE SO FAR?

472
00:34:21,372 --> 00:34:24,583
OCEANIC FLIGHT 815--
LEFT SYDNEY, AUSTRALIA,

473
00:34:24,584 --> 00:34:25,868
HEADED FOR LOS ANGELES,

474
00:34:25,869 --> 00:34:28,836
324 PEOPLE ON BOARD,
INCLUDING THE FLIGHT CREW.

475
00:34:28,837 --> 00:34:31,112
I WANT DETAILED FILES
ON EVERY SINGLE PASSENGER.

476
00:34:31,436 --> 00:34:32,611
ALREADY WORKING ON IT.

477
00:34:33,088 --> 00:34:35,440
CAN WE UPLINK TO RICHARD
IN ACADIA PARK, PLEASE?

478
00:34:40,651 --> 00:34:42,529
YESTERDAY
YOU CALLED ME A LIAR.

479
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:45,647
I WAS HURT BY THAT.

480
00:34:49,531 --> 00:34:51,063
HELLO, RICHARD.
CAN YOU HEAR ME?

481
00:34:56,099 --> 00:34:57,326
NOTICE TODAY'S DATE.

482
00:34:57,445 --> 00:34:59,530
THIS IS LIVE.
OKAY, RICHARD.

483
00:35:12,811 --> 00:35:15,916
OH, MY GOD.
OH, MY GOD.

484
00:35:18,647 --> 00:35:19,922
OH!

485
00:35:20,996 --> 00:35:22,242
OH, MY GOD.

486
00:35:23,469 --> 00:35:24,663
(Ben) A LITTLE OVER
TWYEARS AGO,

487
00:35:24,664 --> 00:35:25,802
TO EVERYONE'S SURPRISE,

488
00:35:26,451 --> 00:35:28,670
RACHEL'S CANCER WENT
INTO COMPLETE REMISSION.

489
00:35:31,921 --> 00:35:34,538
SHORTLY AFTER, SHE GAVE BIRTH
TO A HEALTHY BABY BOY.

490
00:35:35,796 --> 00:35:37,268
HIS NAME IS <i>JULIAN.</i>

491
00:35:46,574 --> 00:35:47,857
OKAY, THANK YOU, RICHARD.

492
00:35:48,393 --> 00:35:50,182
YOU'LL WANT TO GET BACK HERE
AS SOON AS YOU CAN.

493
00:35:50,584 --> 00:35:52,119
????

494
00:35:53,148 --> 00:35:55,497
OH, GOD! NO, NO!

495
00:35:55,957 --> 00:35:57,491
NO! (sobbing)

496
00:36:02,072 --> 00:36:03,682
I'M NOT A LIAR, JULIET.

497
00:36:07,086 --> 00:36:08,312
I WANNA GO HOME.

498
00:36:08,650 --> 00:36:09,245
THAT'S NOT OUR AGREEMENT.

499
00:36:09,246 --> 00:36:11,215
YOU NEED TO STAY HERE
UNTIL YOUR WORK IS FINISHED.

500
00:36:11,216 --> 00:36:14,706
IT'S IMPOSSIBLE.
THE MOTHERS KEEP DYING.

501
00:36:14,707 --> 00:36:16,212
EN WE'LL FIND
MORE MOTHERS.

502
00:36:17,955 --> 00:36:19,160
WHO KNOWS?

503
00:36:19,466 --> 00:36:21,372
MAYBE THERE'S EVEN ONE
ON THAT PLANE.

504
00:36:36,678 --> 00:36:38,006
WAIT.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

505
00:36:39,668 --> 00:36:41,647
SHE'S NOT TOUCHING CLAIRE. SHE'S
THE ONE WHO DID THIS TO HER.

506
00:36:41,648 --> 00:36:44,590
SHE CAN HELP HER, CHARLIE.
SAYS WHO? <i>HER?</i>
HOW CAN YOU EVEN TRUST HER?

507
00:36:44,591 --> 00:36:45,784
????

508
00:36:48,261 --> 00:36:49,517
DO YOU TRUST <i>ME?</i>

509
00:36:51,202 --> 00:36:52,797
DO YOU TRUST ME?

510
00:36:54,810 --> 00:36:56,199
YEAH.

511
00:36:57,696 --> 00:36:59,531
JUST GIVE US
A COUPLE MINUTES HERE, OKAY?

512
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:05,397
HOW LONG BEFORE
THIS TAKES EFFECT?

513
00:37:05,398 --> 00:37:07,357
WE SHOULSEE RESULTS
IN A FEW HOURS.

514
00:37:09,259 --> 00:37:10,453
JULIET...

515
00:37:13,326 --> 00:37:14,180
IF THIS DOESN'T WORK,

516
00:37:14,181 --> 00:37:15,478
IF SOMETHING
HAPPENS TO HER...

517
00:37:18,613 --> 00:37:20,343
I'M NOT GONNA BE ABLE
TO PROTECT YOU ANYMORE.

518
00:37:22,053 --> 00:37:23,360
YOU'LL BE ON YOUR OWN.

519
00:37:26,565 --> 00:37:28,289
I'M ALREADY
ON MY OWN, JACK.

520
00:38:01,886 --> 00:38:03,076
WHAT HAPPENED?

521
00:38:25,762 --> 00:38:29,104
I'VE GOT A TARP,
COUPLE OF BLANKETS,

522
00:38:29,349 --> 00:38:30,726
AIRLINE PILLOWS.

523
00:38:33,801 --> 00:38:34,705
IT'S NOT MUCH,

524
00:38:34,706 --> 00:38:37,129
BUT... IT'LL GET YOU STARTED.

525
00:38:40,250 --> 00:38:41,454
CLAIRE'S AWAKE.

526
00:38:45,193 --> 00:38:48,041
THERE'S A LEAN-TO THAT
WE'VE BEEN USING FOR SHADE,

527
00:38:48,564 --> 00:38:50,429
AND EVERYONE SAYS
THAT IT'D BE ALL RIGHT

528
00:38:50,430 --> 00:38:52,502
IF YOU SET UP CAMP THERE
FOR NOW.

529
00:38:53,630 --> 00:38:54,787
THANK YOU.

530
00:38:55,934 --> 00:38:57,990
THEY'RE GOOD PEOPLE,

531
00:38:57,991 --> 00:38:59,970
AND THEY'RE WILLING TO GIVE YOU
THE BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT.

532
00:39:02,287 --> 00:39:04,680
BUT EVENTUALLY THEY'RE GONNA
NEED SOME ANSWERS.

533
00:39:07,470 --> 00:39:08,747
WHY DON'T YOU?

534
00:39:12,137 --> 00:39:13,636
YOU KEEP TALKING
ABOUT <i>THEM.</i>

535
00:39:15,101 --> 00:39:17,723
WHY DON'T I EVER HAVE
TO EXPLAIN MYSELF TO <i>YOU?</i>

536
00:39:22,029 --> 00:39:23,272
YOU WERE THERE.

537
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:26,468
YOU WERE STANDING
RIGHT NEXT TO ME

538
00:39:26,469 --> 00:39:28,172
WHEN THAT SUBMARINE
EXPLODED...

539
00:39:29,999 --> 00:39:31,981
AND IN THAT MOMENT,
I SAW IT IN YOUR EYES.

540
00:39:34,692 --> 00:39:35,743
YOU WANNA
GET OFF THIS ISLAND

541
00:39:35,744 --> 00:39:37,717
MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE
IN THE WORLD.

542
00:39:42,294 --> 00:39:43,799
THAT MAKES YOU ONE OF US.

543
00:40:08,533 --> 00:40:09,855
(Ben)
 <i>LET'S GO OVER IT AGAIN.</i>

544
00:40:10,059 --> 00:40:13,613
(Juliet) I KNOW WHAT TO DO.
LET'S GO OVER IT AGAIN,
JUST TO BE SURE.

545
00:40:14,882 --> 00:40:17,176
I DRAG AUSTEN
OUT INTO THE JUNGLE,

546
00:40:17,177 --> 00:40:19,331
HANDCUFF MYSELF TO HER,

547
00:40:19,762 --> 00:40:22,280
THEN TELL HER I WAS GASSED
JUST LIKE SHE WAS.

548
00:40:22,281 --> 00:40:25,203
AND IF SHE CATCHES YOU
IN THE LIE?
I'LL ADMIT TO IT,

549
00:40:25,508 --> 00:40:27,566
TELL HER IT WAS THE ONS  WAY
TO EARN HER TRUST.

550
00:40:30,722 --> 00:40:32,761
GOOD. WHAT THEN?

551
00:40:34,201 --> 00:40:35,774
THEY'LL KE ME
BACK TO THE BEACH.

552
00:40:43,093 --> 00:40:44,846
 <i>I KNOW YOU WANT ME</i>
 <i>TO GO THERE,</i>

553
00:40:45,981 --> 00:40:47,846
 <i>BUT AFTER EVERYTHING</i>
 <i>WE'VE DONE TO THEM,</i>

554
00:40:48,898 --> 00:40:50,406
 <i>IT'S GOING TO BE A PROBLEM.</i>

555
00:40:55,692 --> 00:40:57,212
WE'VE ACTIVATED
THE IMPLANT IN CLAIRE.

556
00:40:57,213 --> 00:41:00,060
SHE SHOULD BE SYMPTOMATIC
WITHIN THE NEXT 48 HOURS.

557
00:41:00,603 --> 00:41:02,236
BY THE TIME
YOU GET TO THAT CAMP,

558
00:41:03,223 --> 00:41:05,348
YOU'LL HAVE
A NICE BIG CRISIS TO SOLVE.

559
00:41:08,078 --> 00:41:09,183
 <i>I'LL NEED SUPPLIES.</i>

560
00:41:09,184 --> 00:41:10,851
 <i>PRYCE IS ALREADY ON HIS WAY.</i>

561
00:41:11,469 --> 00:41:13,695
 <i>HE'LL HIDE THE CASE</i>
 <i>AT ETHAN'S OLD DROP POINT.</i>

562
00:41:15,272 --> 00:41:17,322
 <i>TELL JACK</i>
 <i>THAT YOU CAN SAVE HER.</i>

563
00:41:19,445 --> 00:41:20,458
 <i>HE TRUSTS YOU.</i>

564
00:41:29,401 --> 00:41:31,085
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

565
00:41:35,949 --> 00:41:37,450
I'M FINE.

566
00:41:49,703 --> 00:41:51,195
SEE YOU IN A WEEK.

567
00:42:15,523 --> 00:43:23,557
