RUDY: So, here he is.

689
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:52,958
Richard Saunders, honestly,
what a complete cock-sucker.

690
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:55,190
I fuckin' hate people
who can't handle their drugs.

691
00:39:57,640 --> 00:39:58,914
(RICHARD GASPS)

692
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,149
(PANTS)

693
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:02,516
- Shit party, by the way.
- Really shit.

694
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:03,635
And next time,

695
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:05,313
- buy some fucking nibbles.
- RUDY: Mmm!

696
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:29,638
I can't stop thinking about her.

697
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:33,153
I'm never gonna see her again.

698
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:37,079
If it's meant to be, it's meant to be.

699
00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:43,400
Yeah, you're right.

700
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:50,350
No. <i>Ac...</i> No, sorry, no. That's <i>just...</i>
I think that's bullshit.

701
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:52,750
I think that's just something people say

702
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:55,992
when they can't think of anything else.

703
00:40:57,840 --> 00:40:59,194
I shouldn't have done it.

704
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:03,872
I was only trying to make her jealous
and she didn't even notice.

705
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:04,916
Huh!

706
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:08,151
When d'you think it'll come off?

707
00:41:10,520 --> 00:41:11,476
Soon.

708
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,115
(CHUCKLES)

709
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:16,032
Soon... probably.

710
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:43,518
What's going on with us?

711
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:44,954
Hmm?

712
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:48,955
We need to talk,
because I'm really confused.

713
00:41:57,880 --> 00:41:58,995
What are you doing?

714
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:07,759
I wanted to tell you.

715
00:42:10,080 --> 00:42:11,957
But I didn't think you'd understand.

716
00:42:19,720 --> 00:42:21,472
What happened?

717
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:23,715
Is that?

718
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:26,394
Were... Were you born like that?

719
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:27,754
I was in a club.

720
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:30,792
Someone stole it from me.

721
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:32,757
- They... They stole it?
- Yeah, it was a girl.

722
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:34,717
A bloke.

723
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:36,711
A transgender bloke.

724
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:39,718
She wanted to be a man.

725
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:40,995
She had a power.

726
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:44,953
<i>So she... took it from me.
We...</i> We <i>swapped.</i>

727
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:46,235
Holy shit!

728
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:49,073
My cock is out there somewhere.

729
00:42:51,120 --> 00:42:52,394
It's mine.

730
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:55,035
And I'm gonna get it back.

731
00:42:58,920 --> 00:43:00,274
So now you know...

732
00:43:02,920 --> 00:43:04,433
...why we can't be together.

733
00:43:30,200 --> 00:43:31,713
I'll double your money.

734
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:33,552
Whatever it takes.

735
00:43:33,640 --> 00:43:35,392
Just find my cock.

736
00:43:35,480 --> 00:43:36,470
Now, then.

737
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:38,915
Passed-out girl on the floor,
good-looking girl.

738
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:40,115
Hello.

739
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:43,113
- Are you on community service?
- No. Just pretending.

740
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:44,429
You're not on the system.

741
00:43:44,520 --> 00:43:48,593
And if you're not on the system
then you don't exist.

742
00:43:48,680 --> 00:43:50,193
I know who's got your cock.

743
00:43:50,280 --> 00:43:52,112
There's half.

744
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:54,271
You get the rest when I get it back.

745
00:43:54,360 --> 00:43:55,509
Hi, Rudy.

746
00:43:57,800 --> 00:43:58,949
What are you doing here?

747
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:00,474
I came to see you.

748
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:02,153
<i>Pm not the caretaker.</i>

749
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:05,710
I just told you that cos I didn't want you
to know the truth, really.

750
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:08,792
- It's not for me to judge you.
- How did it go?

751
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:12,032
It was amazing,
and then she's ran away. Again.

752
00:44:12,120 --> 00:44:13,679
ABBY: <i>Well, maybe
she's some sexy psycho werewolf</i>

753
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:14,955
<i>who doesn't want you finding out.</i>

754
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:28,953
What are you doing?

755
00:44:30,120 --> 00:44:31,758
Get it out. I wanna see it.
