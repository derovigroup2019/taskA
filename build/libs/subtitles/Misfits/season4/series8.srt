Hello.

2
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:06,830
- Who the fuck are you?
- Abby.

3
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:10,115
- What's she doing here?
- She's on community service.

4
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:11,799
I don't know who I am!

5
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:15,519
When the storm happened, I lost my memory.

6
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:16,749
Forgot everything.

7
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:19,633
So is that it, then?
You and Alex, you... you're together?

8
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:22,234
- Boyfriend and girlfriend.
- Yeah, Finn.

9
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:24,709
Alex? The sexy barman?

10
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:26,194
He's got no dick.

11
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:28,351
This is the greatest day of me life!

12
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:29,839
What's her name?

13
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:31,672
She calls herself James.

14
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:33,717
Get your dick out right now!

15
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:37,117
That's mine!

16
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:45,073
Um... Oh, my G...

17
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:46,150
I came to see you.

18
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:48,510
I'm not the caretaker.

19
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:49,954
It's not for me to judge you.

20
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:54,151
- I've got to go.
- Oh, no, no, don't.

21
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:55,600
Please don't go.

22
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:57,910
- How did it go?
- It was amazing, and then she's...

23
00:00:58,040 --> 00:00:59,394
well, she's ran away!

24
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:00,800
She left her bag.

25
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:06,231
Ahhh...
Shit, I'm in love with a fucking nun.

26
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:44,232
There's a young man here to see you.

27
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:46,670
He says he has your bag.

28
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:55,519
You can send him in.

29
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:57,591
Be careful, Nadine.

30
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:07,669

32
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:13,273
It had a nun in it.

33
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,873

It had penguins in it.

38

I'm getting... I'm an idiot.

39
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:25,951
Nadine will see you now.

40
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:28,390
Penguins.

41
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,471
Are they birds or are they fish?

42
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:34,639
Does it really matter anyway?
We're all God's creatures.

43
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:35,869
<i>So...</i>

44
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:39,631
All right.

45
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:40,909

48
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:47,552
It's not funny.

49
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:50,479
It's just an 'abit. Habit! Cos you...

50
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,312
No?

51
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,470
Ohh.

(EXHALES)

53
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:04,593
So.

54
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:06,318
As it turns out,

55
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,799
you're a nun.

56
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:09,791
(LAUGHS) A... A nun.

57
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:12,110
I'd have never seen that comin'. (LAUGHS)

58
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:14,470
I wanted to tell you.

59
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:16,113
I didn't know what to do.

60
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:18,515
Yeah, you and this nun thing...

61
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:21,393
What does that mean...
for me and you,

62
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:23,630
and... us and our thing?

63
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:26,798
- I mean, is there even a thing, or...
- I've given myself to Jesus.

64
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:28,359
Y-Yeah.

65
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:31,319
But... you know, you and the Jesus fella,

66
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:34,279
is that exclusive, really, cos...
I'd settle for being your booty call!

67
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:36,078
I can't see you again.

68
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:38,919
I'm sorry.

It's... It's all right. <i>So...</i>

70

I understand that's a good decision.

71

that Nadine stops being a frigging nun,

106

If he can build Noah
a massive friggin' ark,

111
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:30,834
he can spare a nun for old Rudy, can't he?

on more girls I care to remember.

honest with you, with all the soft hair,

I've climbed out of windows,

358
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:10,951
I've faked me own death.

359
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:12,400

360

- Yeah. Point being...

And the point is -

364
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:24,992
and this is fucking heart-breaking -
there are shitters

365
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:27,037
and there are people that get shat on.

366
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:31,751
I'm a shitter and I've been shat on
from a bloody great height

367
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:35,470
and it's killing me. You know, me heart's
in little pieces all over the floor here.

that was an act of God?

And you can't stop me, please, mate.

And you, man.
What about when you...

460
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:28,751
the time you were so damn pissed,
you shat in your own bed,

461
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:30,951
and who offered to swap wi' you? Me.

462
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:32,878
That was you.

463
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:35,349
You shat in your own bed
and then offered to swap with me.

- Did I?
- Yeah.

465
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:39,478
Yeah, and why did I do that?

in your own shit.

That's incorrect.

468
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:45,269
It's because
that's what friends do, innit?

469
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:48,870
It's... It's all for one
and one for all, and a nun.

470

- So, what the plan?
- Hmm?

I don't have... I've... I've no idea.
I'm sorry, I've not thought of owt.

472
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:03,590
Do you ever think we suffer from a
complete lack of ambition and imagination?

473
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:07,310
I guess that's why we live in an age
of chronically high youth unemployment.

474

Shut up, man. I'm not a youth, am I?

and I've defiled your petals.

695
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:09,120
I'm really friggin' sorry.

696
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:17,910
Moving speech,
but where does that leave us

697
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:19,951
and the situation
of the Four Horsemen and the Apocalypse?

698
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:22,959
We go out there and we face them together.

699
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:25,429
Really? <i>ls...</i> Is that where we're at?

700
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:28,399
One for all, all for one, and a nun.

701
00:41:29,560 --> 00:41:31,631
My nun.

702
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:34,400
My beautiful nun,
who I love with all my heart, I swear.

703
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:37,833
You'd really do that?

704
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:41,074
You'd all die for me?

705
00:41:50,680 --> 00:41:52,000
Looks that way.

706
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:55,032
So, who goes out there first?

707
00:41:55,120 --> 00:41:56,440
Someone's gotta be first out the door.

708
00:41:56,520 --> 00:41:58,477
I'm gonna go and get the straws.

709
00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:01,871
- I'm really glad I met you.
- What?

710
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:06,472
Oh, no. No! No!

711
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:11,312
Nadine.

712
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:13,317
Don't.

713
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:18,152
No...

714
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:22,479
<i>Oh...</i>

715
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:27,719
(SOBS)

716
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:38,113
No.

717
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:41,039
This isn't how it's supposed to be.

718
00:42:45,640 --> 00:42:46,789
Oh, no.

719
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:50,151
I wanted an ET ending.

720
00:42:51,720 --> 00:42:53,040
<i>(SOBS) Ohh...</i>

721
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:57,959
No...

722
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:20,714
(SOBS)

723
00:43:22,360 --> 00:43:23,919
I really loved her, you know?

724
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:33,199
I know.

725
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:37,673
I know you did.

726
00:43:55,560 --> 00:43:56,789
This is all wrong, this.

727
00:43:58,680 --> 00:44:00,637
I wanted me <i>ET</i> ending.

728
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:02,711
At least we got some BMXs out of it.

729
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:05,433
I always wanted a BMX.

730
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:09,950
I just remembered that!
I just remembered something.

731
00:44:10,080 --> 00:44:11,593
That's a clue.

732
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:13,034
To what?

733
00:44:13,120 --> 00:44:14,599
To my true identity.

734
00:44:15,880 --> 00:44:18,349
OK, think... BMX.

735
00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:21,477
No, I'm still on ET, love, I'm sorry.

736
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:23,470
(PHONE RINGS)

737
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:26,314
Hello?

738
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:27,913
Is he OK?

739
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:29,752
Jesus, <i>um...</i>

740
00:44:31,160 --> 00:44:33,197
I don't know his family.
I know he's a barman.

741
00:44:33,320 --> 00:44:34,879
Yeah...

742
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:37,270
I'm on my way. OK.

743
00:44:37,360 --> 00:44:38,270
Bye.

744
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:40,311
That was the hospital.

745
00:44:40,440 --> 00:44:41,714
It's Alex.

746
00:44:41,800 --> 00:44:43,120
He's got a punctured lung,
they're giving him...

747
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:46,391
Ah!

748
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:48,790
They're giving him a lung transplant.

749
00:44:48,920 --> 00:44:50,115
Shit!

750
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:53,790
I'll tell you now, you don't wanna be
getting a transplant round here.

751
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:55,194
Why's that?

752
00:44:55,280 --> 00:44:58,511
Well, Curtis told me about this girl
he was seein' this one time,

753
00:44:58,640 --> 00:45:01,280
right, and she had an heart transplant.

754
00:45:01,360 --> 00:45:03,317
She only ended up getting hersel'
a teleportation power.

755
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:09,112
And then she ended up getting killed
by a guy who controlled cheese.

756
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:12,670
I'm sure Alex the sexy barman
is gonna be fine.

757
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:15,030
What's the chance
of it happening again, really?
