1
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:06,554
What?

2
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:08,870
Just... don't.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,274
What is wrong with you?

4
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:11,430
I wanted to tell you.

5
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:15,079
But I didn't think you'd understand.

6
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:17,396
- Someone stole it from me.
- They stole it?

7
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:20,592
A girl, a bloke...

8
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:23,115
a transgender bloke.

9
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:24,594
She wanted to be a man.

10
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:26,000
She had a power.

11
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:28,191
- Nadine.
- Oh, I'm Rudy, sorry.

12
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:29,435
- Is that the right time?
- Eh?

13
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:31,836
- I have to go.
- No, don't go.

14
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:33,473
Please...

15
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:36,915
I can't stop thinking about her.

16
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:40,032
- I didn't know you were coming.
- Yeah, Jess asked me.

17
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:41,878
Is that all right with you?

18
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,718
Absolutely fine.

19
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:47,151
I know you'd rather spend the evening
talking to Mr HIV over there.

20
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:48,759
Finn, can we not do this tonight?

21
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:51,554
(GUNSHOT-LIKE BLAST)

22
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:54,153
I'm Abby, by the way.

23
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:35,393
<i># Looking for the way</i>

24
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:40,076

00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:04,675
<i>it I'm moving on</i>

30
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:07,833
# I'm <i>moving</i> on... #

31
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:16,356
I want you to get back out there.

32
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:22,399
I'll double your money,
whatever it takes.

33
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:25,034
Just find my cock!

34
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:32,116
<i>(it THE RAPTURE'. Echoes)</i>

35
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:45,793

<i># They're saying what? I #</i>

42
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:14,836
No.

43
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:17,952
Dude, no, I'm not feeling it.
It's like I'm fucking numb.

44
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:19,514
It's like I'm paralyzed

45
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:22,353
- from me cock down over here...
- Ssh!

46
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:25,677
Listen, oi, you know me,
usually I'd be all over that.

47
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:28,553
This used to be me favourite bit.

48
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:31,314
Look at 'em all, stretching out
their fannies, all nice and wide

49
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:32,993
with their big, swollen milky tits.

50
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:36,078
You know, their vaginas,
they have an expiry date, mate.

51
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:38,510
You've got to get one last taste
of that fruit before it goes off.

52
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:40,074
Do you understand what I'm telling you?

53
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:42,430
There's nothing worse than
a mouldy piece of fruit.

54
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:45,074
Especially peaches.

55
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:47,635
But now, I'm not even interested,
to be honest with you.

56
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,194
I'll tell you why.

57
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,793
- Do you know why?
- No.

58
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:54,356
Well, the girl from last night, Nadine,
I can't get her out of me mind.

59
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:57,033
What's it all about, really?

60
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:59,037
I think it means you really like her.

61
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:00,514
Fuck off!

62
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:02,750
- We should get started.
- Mm.

63
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:14,514
Right, now then.

64
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:17,274
Prime example about
the whole Nadine thing, right?

65
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:20,233
Passed-out girl on the floor,
good-looking girl, normally <i>I...</i>

66
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:21,873
would be thinking...

67
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,315
...balls on face.

68
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:27,758
- But nothing.
- Balls on face?

69
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:30,759
Yeah. Dude, but not in a bloody
creepy way, mate.

70
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:34,555
In a... you know, like... 'Ey, dude...

71
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:37,593
let's put our balls on each other's faces.

72
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,956
For banter, though. Funny.

73
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:42,950
Hello.

74
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:44,354
Morning.

75
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,000
RUDY: Yes!

76
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:57,640
Respect, straight back on it.

77
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,072
(YAWNS)

78
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:08,794
- Who the fuck are you?
- Abby.

79
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:10,274
Who the fuck are you?

80
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,079
What's she doing here?

81
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:16,152
Did you fuck her?

82
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:17,475
- Is that what happened?
- No.

83
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:20,319
Did you fuck her in here?

84
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:23,796
The smell of the sweat and the feel
of the cold, hard tiles on your knees.

85
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:24,955
I didn't touch her.

86
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:27,276
- Better not have.
- What's she doing?

87
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:30,478
She's on community service.

88
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:33,474
Well, n-no-one told me.

89
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,238
Yeah, well, I'm telling you now.

90
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:39,399
You're responsible for her.

91
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:42,398
If she fucks up, you fuck up,

92
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:45,353
and I'll fuck you up all the way to fuck.

93
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:46,436
How is that fair?

94
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:49,518
You can start by cleaning the shit
out of the community centre.

95
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:52,711
Have fun.

96
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:56,310
What's all that about?

97
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:57,953
That is our...

98
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:00,117
that is our probation worker.

99
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:02,914
He's bloody highly strung
and he's very angry

100
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:06,078
and I just think there's a lot of pain
there, to be honest with you.

101
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:08,874
Well, good look with it all.

102
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,673
What are you doing?
You heard what he said,

103
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,871
he's going to fuck me up
all the way to fuck.

104
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,834
And... I don't even know what that means,
but it's not good.

105
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:20,476
- That's your problem.
- Please just help us out for today.

106
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:23,592
L-I'll sort something out, I'll get you
out of it, <i>I'll...</i>

107
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:24,795
I'll fake your death.

108
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:27,394
Where do I get a jumpsuit?

109
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:33,670
Ah, yes.

110
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:35,313
Yes, there.

111
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:46,194
Oh, hello!

112
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:52,236
Do I detect the gentle flush
of the female orgasm?

113
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:53,395
Fuck off.

114
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,393
So is that it then?

115
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:58,113
You and Alex, are you together?

116
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,958
Boyfriend and girlfriend?

117
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:02,754
Yeah, Finn.
We swapped friendship bracelets

118
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:06,071
and then we went to the cinema
and he touched me up.

119
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,679
Are you on community service?

120
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,757
No. Just pretending.

121
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,753
RUDY: I just... I don't understand
whether I'm...

122
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:30,229
whether I'm just thinking about her
because...

123
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:33,239
you know, like I know
I'm never going to see her again.

124
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:37,274
Like... when you go to a vending machine
and there's no prawn cocktail crisps,

125
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:38,714
and all you want is a packet...

126
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:40,194
BOTH: Of prawn cocktail crisps.

127
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:41,714
Exactly that, man.

128
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:43,518
Exactly that.

129
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:48,756
Fuck, now all I can think about is
prawn cocktail crisps, knobhead.

130
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:52,035
Mmm.

131
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:59,795
Yeah, no, I'm still on
prawn cocktail... Fuck it,

132
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:02,275
I'm going to have to go and get
some prawn cocktail crisps.

133
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,232
Get me a packet.

134
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,116
Tomorrow, we're going to be focusing on

135
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,639
the challenges
that you are going to be facing.

136
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:16,274
So, Dads, this is really
where you come in.

137
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:19,233
And Mums, you're going to need
as much help as you can get.

138
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:21,590
Urn, so do you want to come
and have a cup of tea?

139
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:33,590
Yike! <i>Ah...</i>

140
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:35,398
Cool... What the funk!

141
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:40,953
Whoa! Post-op transgender genitalia, what!
God, man,

142
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:44,232
I always knew there was summat dodgy going
on behind that sweet little face of yours.

143
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:46,397
Not this shit, though, dude.
Not chicks with dicks.

144
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:47,635
- Give it to me.
- Eh?

145
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:48,955
- Give it back.
- To be honest with you,

146
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:50,559
you've gone up in my estimation somehow.

147
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:52,273
I'm not looking at them to get turned on.

148
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:56,036
Shit, what are you going to do?
Are you going to get a dick put on?

149
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,912
Yeah.

150
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:00,634
That's exactly what I'm doing,
I'm going to get a dick put on.

151
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:03,035
Se-Se... for serious?

152
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:05,549
Well, I've always wanted a dick
so I just thought, "What am I waiting for,

153
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:07,239
- "let's get a dick."
- Fuckin' hell!

154
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:10,193
Ohh... that's amazing.
So what do they do?

155
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:15,679
I mean, do you buy a dick
or does someone donate you one?

156
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:17,393
You have to order them.

157
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:20,632
You just tell them what colour you want,
how long you want it

158
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:23,479
and you go for a couple of fittings
and they just stitch it on.

159
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:29,352
- That's amazing. Isn't it?
- Mm.

160
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:30,515
I'm going to be honest with you, though,

161
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:33,154
the thought of you with your big floppy
cock has kind of put me off

162
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:35,197
- my prawn cocktail crisps a bit!
- I'll have them.

163
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:36,913
Bastard.

164
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,116
- Anyone fancy a drink?
- I'm in.

165
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:49,950
Let's drink to forget,
drown me bloody sorrows.

166
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:52,071
Just need a shit.
I'll meet you down there.

167
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,270
OK.

168
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:54,754
Enjoy your shit.

169
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,713
Sorry, are you using that?

170
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:03,114
I can't handle this.

171
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:07,074
I can't even go to an antenatal class.
How am I supposed to have a baby?

172
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:09,754
I thought I could do it, but I can't.

173
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:12,633
Oh, it's a design fault.

174
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:14,512

00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:55,834
so I'm gonna go and get a Kit Kat.

00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:05,436
Thought I'd take you
somewhere nice for lunch.

349
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:09,315
Then I thought, "Nah, fuck that.
Petrol station."

350
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:13,479
You all right?

351
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:14,635
Look at 'em.

00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:16,353
The happy couple.

353
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:17,914
Just forget about her.

354
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,559
I'm stupid for even thinking
I could compete with him.

355
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:22,115
I mean, look at 'em. Perfect.

356
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:28,078
Fuck it, right. You...

357
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:29,713
You, shut up, you forced this out of me.

358
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:33,310
He is a man... with a fanny.

359
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:35,515
Are you happy now?

360
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:38,154
What, he's got a fanny?
What, he's a woman?

361
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:39,998
He's got both, like a worm?

362
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:42,794
Shit, I don't know how it works.
It's storm-related, innit?

363
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:47,676
All I know is where once there was
a penis, there is now merely a vagina.

364
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:49,473
Are you sure about this?

365
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:55,033
Dude, honestly, Alex,
sexy barman, he's got no dick.

This is the greatest day of me life.

369
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:05,713
I c... I could cry happy tears all
over his little hairy man fanny.

370
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:08,150
Yeah, listen, don't be saying anything,
though, because apparently he's quite

371
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:10,078
sensitive about the whole thing,
you know what I mean?

372
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:11,838
Oh, he's sensitive, is he?

373
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:13,075
Oh, dear.

374
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:16,158
Yeah, well he might be good-looking,
and he might have the girl,

375
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:19,113
but he hasn't got a penis
and, really, isn't that all that matters?

376
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:22,596
Well, yeah, there's that
and the love of a good woman, really.

377
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:26,833
So, he hasn't got a dick and you have,

378
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:29,076
but Jess would still rather be with him.

379
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:33,914

387
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:01,993
Maybe I should just tell her that I'm not

00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:52,913
Well, I'm the senior caretaker,

520
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:55,554
so technically I'm on call,
like, 24 hours a day.

521
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:57,353

522
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:59,756

a doctor in many...

I'm just saying, I'm lying- I---

527
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:15,590
I just told you that cos I didn't
want you to know the truth, really.

528
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:17,159
I'm on community service.

529
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:24,159
It's just that you're so pretty
and... you're clever.

530
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:26,032
I thought that if you knew the truth,

531
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:29,073
then you just wouldn't want to
bother even talking to me.

532
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:31,629

It was amazing and then she's...

542
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:16,274
She ran away - again.

543
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:17,475
She left her bag.

544
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:19,670

545
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:23,317
Why does she keep running off, then?

546
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:26,319
Because she's a girl. That's what they do.

547
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:28,351
They string you along like a little puppy

548
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:32,030
and then, when you think you've got
a chance, they end up with...

549
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:35,357
some guy who works in a bar
who doesn't even have a dick.

550
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:38,313
Maybe she's some sexy psycho werewolf
who doesn't want you finding out.

551

00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:12,789
Too late.

692
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:14,399
You didn't want him.

693
00:42:14,520 --> 00:42:15,590
Jake.

694
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:19,073
That's what I was gonna call him.

695
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:27,114
I thought I couldn't do it,
and I probably can't, but I've got to try.

696
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:30,670
And since he's been gone,
he's all I can think about.

697
00:42:33,160 --> 00:42:34,878
He is the only thing I've got.

698
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:40,873
You'd better fucking look after him.

699
00:42:42,680 --> 00:42:46,992
If he grows up to be a pimp,
a child molester or a probation worker,

700
00:42:47,120 --> 00:42:48,474
I will kick your arse.

701
00:42:49,640 --> 00:42:50,835
(SNIFFS)

702
00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:11,351
(BREATHES HEAVILY)

703
00:43:34,520 --> 00:43:35,794
What happened to the baby?

704
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:37,956
I gave him back.

705
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:42,309
Are you OK?

706
00:43:42,440 --> 00:43:43,953
- Fine.
- Oh, what?!

707
00:43:44,080 --> 00:43:47,516
Alex gets his dick back,
Mum gets her baby back.

708
00:43:47,640 --> 00:43:50,792
I don't get my beautiful nun.
How the frig is that fair?

709
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:53,912
So, I guess this is it, then.

710
00:43:54,040 --> 00:43:55,314
Emotional farewell.

711
00:43:55,400 --> 00:43:56,356
Where you going?

712
00:43:56,480 --> 00:43:58,835
That's the beauty of pretending
to be on community service.

713
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:00,633
You're not actually on community service.

714
00:44:01,840 --> 00:44:03,717
Maybe see you around.

715
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:09,190
You've been fucking with me!

716
00:44:11,240 --> 00:44:13,072
You don't get to fuck with me!

717
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:26,030
Do you know what they do to people
who pretend to be on community service?

718
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:46,354
So, this is ironic, innit?

719
00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:49,637
Maybe it's meant to be.

720
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:53,151
I mean, it's the first steps to
finding out who I actually am.

721
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:55,078
It's all part of some big cosmic plan.

722
00:45:00,360 --> 00:45:01,953
You just stepped in some dog shit.

723
00:45:14,840 --> 00:45:17,070
There is a young man here to see you.

724
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:18,679
- No, no, no, no, no, no.
- Be careful, Nadine.

725
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:19,710
No, don't go.

726
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:21,471
Rudy?

727
00:45:24,320 --> 00:45:25,754
Fucking...

728
00:45:25,880 --> 00:45:27,234
That's my fucking TV!

729
00:45:27,320 --> 00:45:30,153
Well, we're just gonna have to put
it down to an act of God, Finley!

730
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:32,436
- So, what's the plan?
- You could use the special powers you got

731
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:35,074
after being struck by that
random freak storm.

732
00:45:35,160 --> 00:45:37,037
Ssh! Now, shut up.

733
00:45:37,160 --> 00:45:38,958
- Sister Ca...
- Mm!

734
00:45:39,080 --> 00:45:41,390
- You just head-butted a nun.
- It's fine. She's an evil bitch.

735
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:44,638
Look at her. This whole searching for
a bullshit connection thing.

736
00:45:44,760 --> 00:45:46,398
It's just an excuse to be
an enormous slut.

737
00:45:46,520 --> 00:45:49,797
That's my incredibly subtle way of asking
if you want to fuck me.

738
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:50,955
What's that?

739
00:45:51,080 --> 00:45:52,798
It's them.

740
00:45:52,920 --> 00:45:54,433
Who?

741
00:45:54,560 --> 00:45:56,312
The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse.
