Do you want to come back to mine
for a drink?

00:00:02,440 --> 00:00:04,078
My neighbor's just called me.

3
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:06,800
Said my flat's been broken into.
I have to go.

4
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:09,394
I see all these girls coming on to him.
He knocks them all back.

5
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:11,073
You could come over later and watch a DVD.

6
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:13,071
It's cos you want
to get in my knickers, right?

7
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:14,150
I'll settle for a kiss.

8
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:15,793
I've got another power.

00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:17,757

if I was bringing girls back

119
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:18,479

120
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:19,550

121
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:23,912

I'm sure she doesn't want me there.

122
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:27,316
'Ey, she's into all that er, dogging.

123
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:29,710
I used to think you had to own a dog
to take part in that shit.

124
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:32,309
I made up this elaborate story
this one time, listen to this,

125
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,198
about a cooker spaniel
by the name of Bobby.

126
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:37,033
Got crippling arthritis
in his back legs,

127
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,599
had to have the bastards removed,

128
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:40,671
replaced with a set of wheels.

129
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,279
He was...he was loyal,
he was faithful

130
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:44,590
and he got me more minge
than you can shake a stick at.

131
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:48,353
I bloody miss that dog, you know.

132
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:51,592
You're remembering he...
he didn't actually exist?

133
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:54,069
Yeah, I know, but certain larger ladies

134
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:56,834
that gathered at designated
lay-bys and picnic areas,

135
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:59,070
they did not know that.

136
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:01,510
We need a system,
for when we bring girls back.

137
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:03,870
Really? Are you planning on doing that?
Dude, I just assumed

138
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:06,349
that your cock had withered
and shriveled like a tiny raisin

139
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:07,550
in the hot Californian sun.

140
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:09,870
There's no withering or shriveling.

141
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:12,998
I prefer to think of him as a tiger.

142
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:14,070
Really?

143
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:16,390
Well, he hasn't fed for a while,
but he's poised,

144
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:17,834
ready to pounce.

145
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:21,711
I just need to find an angle.

146
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:24,599
Right, here's your angle -
borrow Bobby.

147
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:27,559
You're offering to lend me
your imaginary dog?

148
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:28,630
Yes, I bloody well am.

149
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:31,314
If you were any kind of a man at all,
you'd be over there,

150
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:34,199
you'd be telling her a heart-breaking
story about a little dog wi' arthritis.

152
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:48,389

153
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:52,238
What?

154
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:53,913
Wait, wait. Talk slower.

155
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:57,199
Where are you?

156
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:58,554
No, just stay there.

157
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:05,589
What is it?

158
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:09,470
It came in the post.

159
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:12,710
He knows where I work.

160
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:15,840
I have to go away for a while.

161
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:16,990
Where are you going to go?

162
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,190
I don't know.

163
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:20,550
Somewhere away from here,
anywhere he can't find me.

164
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:21,431
What about us?

165
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,790
If I stay, he'll hurt me.

166
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:25,990
I have to go.

167
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:28,111
You don't have to.

168
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:30,111
I'll talk to him.

169
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:32,350
I'll go see him.

170
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:33,510
I'll tell him you're with me now.

171
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:35,472
You think he's going to listen to you?

172
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:36,550
I'll make him listen.

173
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:38,432
No,no,no.

174
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:40,710
You don't know what he's like.

175
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:43,599
This one time we were in a bar.

176
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:45,079
He thought this guy was looking at me.

177
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:47,713
He nearly beat him to death.

178
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:50,758
If you go round there, he'll kill you.

179
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:53,434

Guns?

700
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:00,912
I'm sorry.

701
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:11,478
(PHONE RINGS)

702
00:43:17,320 --> 00:43:19,914
Hiya, mate. How you doin'?

703
00:43:19,960 --> 00:43:21,917
You mean apart from being a zombie?

704
00:43:22,040 --> 00:43:23,633
Fuck.

705
00:43:24,760 --> 00:43:25,989
He's still a zombie.

706
00:43:29,560 --> 00:43:33,474
Where are you, man?
We'd...we'd love to have a little chat,

707
00:43:33,560 --> 00:43:35,278
<i>lust...</i>

708
00:43:35,360 --> 00:43:37,920
talk through these options, eh?

709
00:43:38,040 --> 00:43:39,360
The way I see it...

710
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:42,392
...there's only one option.

711
00:43:43,480 --> 00:43:46,233
I'm really sorry
it's come down to this, mate.

712
00:43:46,320 --> 00:43:48,789
None of us chose this shit.

713
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:50,678
Are you sure we can't...

714
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:56,114
...manufacture some sort of
an happy ending?

715
00:43:56,200 --> 00:43:59,750
Cos, you know...
you know I love them happy endings. <i>Ha...</i>

716
00:43:59,880 --> 00:44:01,598
There ain't no happy endings.

717
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:04,109
It's zombie noir, innit?

718
00:44:05,320 --> 00:44:07,550
We could go for a pint.

719
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:11,791
Just me and you -
two boring old fuckers -

720
00:44:11,880 --> 00:44:13,757
<i>and talk about the good old days.</i>

721
00:44:15,240 --> 00:44:18,039
We'll just have one last pint, eh?

722
00:44:18,120 --> 00:44:19,440
It's better this way.

723
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:24,599
Take care of yourself, yeah?

724
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:33,711
# .../ already know... #

725
00:44:33,800 --> 00:44:34,870
(GUNSHOT)

726
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:42,791
<i># ...Already know</i>

727
00:44:42,920 --> 00:44:47,710
# <i>How this will end...</i> #

728
00:45:17,080 --> 00:45:19,674
I was looking for Dan Woollaston.

729
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:20,830
That's my dad.

730
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:22,917
I think he might be my dad, too.

731
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:25,236
Do you really think
you can have a relationship

732
00:45:25,320 --> 00:45:26,833
with some guy
you've never even met before?

733
00:45:26,920 --> 00:45:27,671
He's me dad.

734
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:29,194
Do you want to tell me
what we're doing here?

735
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:31,191
This guy, Alex, has got a date
with a friend of mine,

736
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:33,510
and we're finding out if he's gay.

737
00:45:33,640 --> 00:45:34,710
Why?

738
00:45:34,840 --> 00:45:37,229
So I can completely destroy
his relationship with Jess

739
00:45:37,360 --> 00:45:38,509
before it's even started.

740
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:40,790
I think he's paying him for sex.

741
00:45:40,920 --> 00:45:43,594
There's something I need to ask you.

742
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:45,079
Please don't fuck me sister.

743
00:45:45,160 --> 00:45:47,549
I'm genetically programmed
to fuck people's sisters.

744
00:45:47,640 --> 00:45:50,314
You think this is what I expected
when I went looking for me dad?!
