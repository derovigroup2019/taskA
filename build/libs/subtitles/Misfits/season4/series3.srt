You're special.

178
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:51,558
I enjoyed our little chat.

179
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:53,233
To be continued, yeah?

180
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:56,758
You're acting again.

181
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:19,354
We forgot the remote control
for the TV. There's no remote.

182
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:21,477
And to a guy,
that's like losing a testicle.

183
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:24,791
It's like losing three testicles.
We need to go round to Lisa's to get it.

184
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:27,394
And by "we", I mean
you need to drive me round there.

185
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:29,756
And there's no way you can just get up
and walk over to the TV

186
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:31,194
when you need to change channels?

187
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:34,193
Is that a joke? This isn't the '70s.

188
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:35,998
OK. Whatever.

189
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:51,235
Are you OK?

190
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:58,194
This whole thing with inviting me
over to watch a DVD.

191
00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:00,191
It's cos you want
to get in my knickers, right?

192
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:03,115
Is that a trick question?

193
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:05,679
I just want you to be straight with me.

194
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:07,319
It's not a deal breaker.

195
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:10,631
It's not like I need to be
fingering a girl to enjoy a movie,

196
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:11,915
you know, far from it.

197
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,038
I mean, if we're going there,
I'll settle for a kiss,

198
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:17,555
maybe a feel of your tits.

199
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:20,473
Are we haggling?
I feel like I'm in a Moroccan souk.

200
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:22,437
Go and get the remote control.

201
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:25,119
Right.

202
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:36,190
I forgot the remote control.

203
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:46,915
Were you checking me out?

204
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,832
What? No.

205
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:51,992
Who? I-l was...

206
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:53,718
The remote control. Thank God.

207
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:55,677
It's like losing three testicles.

208
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:59,640
Finn, relax. It's not like
you haven't seen my arse before.

209
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:02,155
At least you think I've got
something worth looking at.

210
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:03,878
I should probably go.

211
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:07,433
What?

212
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:10,433
When I was with your dad...

213
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:11,715
did you fancy me?

214
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:15,350
No. Why would you?
You're... No.

215
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:18,831
Well, I'm closer to your age
than I am your dad's.

216
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,752
I know what teenage boys are like.

217
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:27,040
Not this one. I'm like, exams, sport,
girls me own age.

218
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:29,953
I know you used to, um...

219
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:33,396
masturbate over those topless photos
of me.

220
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:35,232
You've got the wrong guy.

221
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:37,749
Er, I found them
hidden under your mattress.

222
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:41,998

225
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:48,109
I liked it.

226
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:51,239
The thought of you...

227
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:55,072
...touching yourself
while you looked at me.

228
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:58,431
Long time ago. It's all a blur.

229
00:15:58,520 --> 00:15:59,919
Can I please just get
the remote control?

230
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,399
Sure.

231
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:04,476
Thanks.

232
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:06,949
I still think of you looking at me.

233
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:08,713
That's nice.

00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:12,831
Are you out of your fucking mind?

236
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:15,799
I think about you and me.

237
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:18,190
- You shouldn't be doing that.
- Oh, yeah?

238
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:19,429
No.

239
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:20,919
What the f...?

240
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:24,197
No, no, no. No, don't do...don't do that.

241
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:27,079
No, no! Yes, yes...

L---

246
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:51,918
I just need to use your bathroom.

247
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:57,119
Phoo.

248
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:09,035
One remote control.
Mission accomplished. Let's go.

249
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:11,116
Are you OK?

250
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:13,396
I'm good. Remote control in hand.

251
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:14,515
Start the engine.

252
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:20,915
Unh! You come in my mouth and then
you go running back to your girlfriend!

253
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,799
Good one. She's hilarious.
Mental. Drive the car.

254
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:26,474
Your boyfriend just
put his cock in my mouth.

These things happen!

259
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:38,237
I'm such a mess.

260
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:41,677
I'm such a fucking mess.

261
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:50,956
Probably best not to tell me dad
about any of this.

262
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:52,075
I really don't see it
helping anyone.

263
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:53,230
You're walking away?

264
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:56,555
You're just like him.

265
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:59,114
You're just like your dad.

266
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:02,198
He's definitely taller.

267
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:03,873
I thought you liked me?

268
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:05,155
I do.

269
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:08,350

I've left a chicken in the oven.

272
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:51,590
I went to go and see Mum and Dad.

273
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:53,079
Mum's not very happy.

274
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:56,630
She says she caught Dad staring at
some woman's tits in the Happy Eater.

275
00:18:56,720 --> 00:19:00,395
Dad said...he was admiring her blouse,

276
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:04,030
which seems very...unlikely.

277
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:06,316
I don't know why
he puts up wi' her shit.

278
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,516
He should cave her skull in
with that crappy polar bear paperweight.

279
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:14,715
What's up with you?

280
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:16,916
It's more of a question
of what's in me.

281
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:19,998
Have you taken an E?

282
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,912

He's in here. Ain't he?

00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:44,119
What d'you want?

291
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:45,759
If you want to get psychological?

292
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:49,959
I reckon Freud would probably say
I wanted to fuck me mum.

293
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:56,356
I'd say, "Freud, you haven't seen our mum
lately. Maybe Auntie Barbara."

294
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:58,078
Auntie Barbara's dead.

295
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:00,959
Well then, I guess she's off the menu.

00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:04,829

he had your toothbrush up his arse.

The whole crazy thing with Lisa.
I can explain.

310
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:52,358
You can explain how you fucked her?

311
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:53,999
- I didn't fuck her.
- Who's that?

312
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:58,392
His step mum. He's a stepmother-fucker.

313
00:21:58,480 --> 00:21:59,754
Oh, man!

314
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:02,354
One, she isn't me step mum,
and two, I didn't fuck her.

315
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:03,669
She just sucked him off.

316
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:05,239
You're a stepmother-sucker?

317
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:06,589
One, I didn't suck anything.

318
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:08,512
Two, she's a woman,
she hasn't got a penis.

319
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:10,511
Oh, she's the stepmother-sucker.

00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:14,150
No! One, she isn't me step mum. Two...

321
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:16,834
Can we talk about something else?

322
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:18,115
So she did suck you off?

323
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:23,194
Only technically.
It was an accident.

324
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:25,715
You tripped
and inserted your cock in her mouth?

325
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:29,395
We're in the kitchen and suddenly
she starts going down on me.

326
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:33,030
Before I could stop her, she gets me <i>ff...</i>
out and rams it in her...

327
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:36,351
and I was like, "Whoa!"
And then I was like...

328
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:37,874
Coming in her mouth.

329
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:40,230
Thank you.

330
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:41,919
I think everyone got it.

331
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,356
If you really wanted to stop her,
you could have grabbed a fork

332
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:47,636
and then rammed it in her eye.

333
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:50,230
Perhaps a little extreme?

334
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:51,634
Why don't you just tell the truth?

335
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:55,437
Oh, I'm sure you put up
a huge fight,

336
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:58,638
but then you felt the tip
of your cock slide into her mouth

337
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:02,873
and it were all warm, weren't it?
And wet and grabby.

338
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:06,590
"I'm getting my dick sucked!
I'm fucking invincible!"

339
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:10,230
You just had to spray your seed
down the back of her throat,

340
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:11,919
you couldn't help yourself.

341
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,229
Do you know why?

342
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:15,351

00:45:50,600 --> 00:45:54,389
<i># Ain't no love in the heart of the city</i>

708
00:45:56,720 --> 00:45:57,915
# <i>Ain't</i> no love... #

709
00:45:58,000 --> 00:45:59,320
Got you a present.

710
00:46:02,440 --> 00:46:06,673
# <i>...Ain't no love and it sure is</i> a <i>pity</i>

711
00:46:08,440 --> 00:46:09,510
# <i>Ain't</i> no love... #

712
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:11,750
So you are a bad boy after all.

713
00:46:17,080 --> 00:46:18,479
# <i>When you were mine...</i> #

714
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:20,233
<i>That...</i>

715
00:46:20,360 --> 00:46:24,752
is fucking nice cake.

716
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:28,800
# <i>This old neighbourhood...</i> #

717
00:46:29,680 --> 00:46:32,354
What needs to be done...
needs to be done.

718
00:46:32,440 --> 00:46:34,477
You're gonna bring him
back to life, aren't you?

719
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:35,630
You used me.

720
00:46:35,720 --> 00:46:37,677
He says he's gonna kill me.

721
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:39,114
<i>JESS: I think Curtis is in trouble.</i>

722
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:41,077
I'm not gonna let that happen.

723
00:46:41,160 --> 00:46:42,753
He attacked me.

724
00:46:42,840 --> 00:46:44,797
- (COCKS GUN)
- Have you got any jelly?

725
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:46,029
What d'you need jelly for?

726
00:46:46,120 --> 00:46:49,351
I would've thought that was
pretty friggin' obvious. Check that out.

727
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:51,158
Where are you, you little shit? Come on!

728
00:46:51,240 --> 00:46:53,117
Some things were just not meant to be.

729
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:55,430
Are you sure we can't...

730
00:46:55,520 --> 00:46:57,511
manufacture some sort
of an 'appy ending?
