I am also on community service.

182
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,713
It all started yesterday.

183
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:31,559
There we were, we were all gathered
around the vending machine

184
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:34,240
after another
arse-numbingly boring day.

185
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:36,840
<i>Our mate Seth
had just come back from Africa</i>

186
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,553
<i>and he had quite</i> a <i>story to tell.</i>

187
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:42,109
<i>...so</i> we end up traveling to Uganda.

188
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:46,472
And we're in this village and some
kid wanders into a minefield,

189
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:48,238
ends up standing on a mine.

190
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:49,918
If he moves, he's dead.

191
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:54,716
Kelly marches over, does her rocket
science thing and defuses the mine.

192
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:56,159
Kelly?

193
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:59,431
- She defused a mine?
- The villagers love her out there, man.

194
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:01,790
- They're all singing and dancing...
- Nachos...

195
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:05,790
<i>...or</i> a Twix?

196
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:09,639
Sweet and savoury -
it's man's eternal dilemma.

197
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:14,230
So, anyway,
I'm just back to get our stuff.

198
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:17,437
Kelly's fucking off
her community service.

199
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:21,474
We're going to stay out there
and...defuse landmines.

200
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:23,875
She's not coming back.

201
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:25,638
- Who?
- Kelly.

202
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:27,119
What?!

203
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:30,995
She's not coming...?
When was this decided?

204
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:33,236
Do we not...? I mean,
do we get a say in any...?

205
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:35,078
I am shocked and I am reeling.

206
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:37,589
I'm going to get some chocolate
because I'm very upset.

210
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:01,393
It's my money...

211
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,950
So this money he's talking about
must be in the briefcase.

212
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:10,474
It's got a combination lock.

213
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:13,359
Can we not just get a bloody big hammer
and a chisel, bust it open?

214
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:16,956
If you open it without the combination,
it activates one of these dye-pack things.

215
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:18,792
It stains the money. It's unusable.

216
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:21,156
Since when did you become
such a bloody expert?

217
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:22,799
I watch a lot of heist movies.

00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:25,190

How do we know you didn't take the case?

- Do you? All right, then, genius.

349
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:59,194
Go with it. Just let it wash over you.
It's like a gentle autumn breeze.

350
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:09,272
<i>Ooh...</i> Eh?

351
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:11,397
Sleepy-time for Bobos.

352
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:20,509
(SHE GASPS)

353
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:22,591
What the fuck?!

354
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:24,869
Who is that? Is that you?

355
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,718
Of course it's me! Who else would it be?

356
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:29,838
Oh, my God. What's that?
There's something moving in me hand.

357
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:31,194
That's my tit!

358
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:32,600
Oh, sorry.

359
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:36,153
Just stop touching my tits!

360
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:39,392
I was trying to find me phone.

361
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:40,595
It's not in my bra!

362
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:46,600
- There's no signal. You?
- Never when you really need it.

363
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:48,393
(SHOUTS) Help! Help!

364
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:49,709
Shh.

365
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:51,074
Hey. Relax.

366
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:55,074
He's just messing with us.

367
00:23:56,240 --> 00:24:01,679
This is probably all part of
some elaborate initiation ritual,

368
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:04,149
you know,
like in those posh private schools

369
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:07,835
where they toast crumpets
and eat each other's shit?

370
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:11,515
You are so naive.
You're a pedophile's wet dream.

371
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:14,718
"Hey, little boy. Do you want
to come with me into the bushes

372
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:17,030
"and suck on
my cock-shaped lollipop?"

373
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:19,919
What?

374
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:25,798
Wasn't in the bushes.

375
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,718
It was at me uncle's house.

376
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:36,799
He had this...
big, old house in the country.

377
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:42,070
It was surrounded by cornfields.

378
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:45,799
It was beautiful.

379
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:50,994
I used to stay there in the summer
when I was a kid.

380
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:56,714
Every night,
me uncle came to my room.

381
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:01,510
I can still feel him on top of me...

382
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:07,310
...the smell of whisky
and cigarettes on his breath...

383
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:12,949
After he raped me...

384
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:19,073
I'd feel his tears
falling on me face...

385
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:22,791
...like salty rain.

386
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:24,473
(SNIFFS)

387
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:30,960
I'm joking.

388
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:33,869
You prick!

389
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:37,112
- I thought you were being serious.
- Ow! Jesus!

390
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:39,794
- You dick! Why would you do that?
- I was trying to lighten the mood.

391
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:42,599
You think a story about you getting
horribly raped by your uncle

392
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:44,279
is going to lighten the mood?

393
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:47,239
I'm just saying. It could be worse.

394
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:50,472
You could be locked in a freezer
with me imaginary rapist uncle.

395
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:55,313
Suddenly,
things don't seem quite so bad.

396
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:58,393
(SHOUTS) Help! Help!

397
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:01,711
I've done both bollocks,
a couple of fingers and his bell-end.

398
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:05,439
What did he say?

399
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,957
He said "ouch" and "fuck you".

400
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:11,999
So, what do we do with him?

401
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:15,031
Put him on ice
until he's ready to talk.

402
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:23,754
Is it just me, or is it reminding you
of the end of Titanic?

403
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:28,200
I'm going to die in a freezer

404
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:30,920
on my first day of community service.

405
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:37,511
I thought I'd have kids,
grow old and ugly.

406
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:39,830
I'd die in my sleep
with all my family around me.

407
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:44,477
I always thought I'd die in a car crash.

408
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:48,400
A silver Mercedes 300 SL Gullwing.

409
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:50,869
I'm off me head
on prescription painkillers.

410
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:54,875
Just finished getting sucked off
by Angelina Jolie.

411
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:57,190
I open me eyes and bang!

412
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:01,234
I hit a tree, a big fuck-off oak tree,

413
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:04,995
on top of a hill, looking out at the sea.

414
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:08,312
Angelina lives,
but she's horribly disfigured.

415
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,320
Sadie?

416
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:15,715
Who's Sadie?

417
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:19,509
Me dog.

418
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:21,750
If I die, who's going to feed me dog?

419
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:24,229
(EXHALES SLOWLY)

420
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:29,669
Are you (dying?

421
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:33,436
I... I really need a wee.

422
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:37,114
I have a small bladder.

423
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:39,077
Don't mind me, if you want <i>to...</i>

424
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:40,958
I'm not going to piss myself
in front of you.

425
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:43,077
What if we piss ourselves
in front of each other?

426
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:44,389
There's no shame in that.

427
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:48,393
Do you want to freestyle
or do you want to synchronize?

428
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:49,709
On the count of three?

429
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,559
Oh, this can't be happening.

430
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:54,870
Are you pissing in your pants
or are you getting it out?

431
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:57,270
- I'll be pissing in my pants.
- OK!

432
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:00,150
I'm going to just...

433
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:03,078
- There he is.

434
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:04,434
All right?

435
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:08,470
Here we go. On three...

436
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:10,710
Will you please just shut the fuck up
and let me piss myself?

437
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:12,234
OK.

and watch Countdown!

I've got a dog!

444
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,469
We're going to die in here.

445
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:53,517
What if they really are
two innocent young offenders

446
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:55,830
who just showed up here this morning
to do their community service?

447
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:58,116
I believe you'll find
there's no such thing

448
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:00,919
as an innocent young offender, is there?

449
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,320
Guilty!

450
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:05,789
Fuck 'em.

451
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:19,154
- Who is he?
- He must be the guy with the case.

452
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:24,392
Jesus, get it off me! You just
touched me face with his stump!

453
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:26,949
Don't be such a baby. It was an accident.

454
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:28,678
It touched me mouth.

455
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:30,114
That's how people get AIDS.

456
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:34,318
Yeah, there's other ways, too.

457
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:36,516
Like sharing needles
and fucking monkeys.

458
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:37,999
Who are you?

459
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:45,439
We're on community service.

460
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:49,039
Where's my case?

461
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:51,316
We don't know anything
about your briefcase.

462
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:53,789
We show up here this morning, hmm?

463
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:56,269
This guy pretends to be
our probation worker.

464
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:58,391
He tells us this crazy story,

465
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:01,233
then he drugs us
and locks us in a freezer.

466
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:03,550
So, why don't you tell us
what the fuck is going on?

467
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:06,951
You can entertain us
while we all slowly freeze to death.

00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:18,511
...me and the guys I used to run with...

00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:22,150
we just robbed a case full of cash
from some diamond dealer.

471
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:24,629

(GROANS)

487
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:16,313
It's like...

488
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:19,119
I infected them.

489
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:23,514
<i>I lost...</i>

...everyone I ever cared about.

491
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:35,159
So, I wonder where the case is.

492
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:38,711
Why are you suddenly so interested?

493
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:41,394
- Are you infected?
- No. What about you?

494
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:44,950
Look at him. He's dying and frozen.

495
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:48,272
It's obviously not working any more.

496
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:51,199
Obviously.

497
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:58,918
So, via a scientific process
of elimination,

498
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,196
I have established that Curtis...

499
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:04,158
...he must have that case.

500
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,992
But we've got the guy
who knows the combination.

501
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:11,878
Checkmate.

502
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:15,594

503
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:18,394
Well, that's the same difference,
isn't it? Really?

504
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:21,757
So, what do you say me and you team up,
kill Curtis, split the cash?

505
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:24,355
Curtis is a dick.

506
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:26,078
You?

507
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:27,116
You're different.

00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:33,955
Not really.
