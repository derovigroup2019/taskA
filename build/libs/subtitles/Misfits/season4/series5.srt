364
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:15,840
- I need to look after my dad.
- He's booked a nurse, so he's all good.

365
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:17,319
Not good, you know...

366
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:19,516
- Cared for.
- He's booked a nurse?

367
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:22,433
He thought it would be good
if we got to know each other.

368
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:23,840
You know, now you're me sister.

369
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:24,990
Half-sister.

370
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:27,037
Come on, one drink.

371
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:28,918
Come on, one drink! Or...

372
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:32,231
Or ten.

373
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:33,833
It's up to you.

374
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:36,036
But we're gonna have so much fun.

375

(SIGHS)

376
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:40,398
I'm a fun guy.

377
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:46,238
So, do you have any brothers or sisters?

378
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:48,118
No. You?

379
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:50,237
You already asked me that.

380
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:52,072
Right.

381
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:54,469
<i>Er...</i>

382
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:56,392
Have you got any pets?

383
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:58,118
No. You?

384
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,957
I did once pretend to have a dog.

385
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:03,519
It was really me girlfriend.

386
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:06,912
We don't need to go there.

387
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:12,030
<i>So...</i>

388
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:15,392
There was something...

389
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:16,834
I wanted to talk to you about.

What's up?

00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:28,519
- All right?
- All right.

393
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:29,829
It's him.

394
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:32,070
Alex, "from the bar".

395
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:33,912
(INDISTINCT SPEECH IN BACKGROUND)

396
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:35,996
No.

397
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:38,835
In there.

398
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:44,473
Did that just look
a little bit gay to you?

399
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:45,789
Did it?

400
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:49,031
OK, if you say so.

401
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:53,599
D'you wanna tell me what we're doing here?

402
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:56,189
This guy, Alex, "from the bar",

403
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:59,910
he's got a date with a friend of mine
and we're finding out if he's gay.

404
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,399
Why?

405
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:03,994
So I can completely destroy
his relationship with Jess

406
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:05,275
before it's even started.

407
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:06,430
You like this girl Jess?

408
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:11,429
I might. That's not the point!
Just keep your eyes...

409
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:12,715
Now, where did they go?

410
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:39,394
I think he's paying him for sex.

411

Do something.

415
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:36,110
You've got a power.

416
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:40,034
More importantly, Alex, "from the bar"...

417
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:41,440
is gay!

418
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:43,670
Oh! He... He is so gay.

419
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:48,596
Oh, shit. They're here.

420
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:52,237
He doesn't waste any time, does he?

421
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:54,231
Quick polish of his cock
and then he's ready to roll.

422
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:56,436
- Finn.
- What do we do?

423
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:58,557
Play... Play it cool, play it cool.

424
00:23:58,640 --> 00:23:59,789
Hey!

425
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,957
Hey, good to see you. Hi, Jess.

426
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:05,156
Jess, this is me sister...
well, half-sister, Grace.

Grace, this is Jess.

428
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:08,317
It's Alex, right? Yeah, I'm Finn.

429
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:11,791
This is me sister... half-sister, Grace.

430
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:12,915
Grace, this is Alex.

431
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:16,356
- "From the bar".
- What's with the speech marks?

432
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:18,397
No idea! (CHUCKLES)

433
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:19,595
So, how are you?

434
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:21,199
How's it hanging, dawg?

435
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:24,509
Why are you being so weird?

436
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:26,358
What? Who's being weird?

437
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:28,749
(LAUGHS)

438
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:32,151
Oh! She's always like this.

439
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:33,958
You should see her
when we're on community service.

440
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:35,599
We have such a laugh.
Don't we have a laugh?

441
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:37,916
Are you on community service?

442
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,957
You told me you were studying engineering.

443
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:47,472
Did I?

444
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:50,439
Well, this is awkward,
so I'm going to the toilet.

445
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:55,313
You know what?

446
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:57,437
Oh, I need a piss, too.

447
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:59,158
Synchronized bladders.

448
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:09,233
Jess.

449
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:10,549
What are you doin'?

450
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:13,154
- It's about Alex.
- What about him?

451
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:15,794
He's gay.

452
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:17,712
And I'm pretty sure
he's paying men for sex.

453
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:20,314
- Finn.
- I'm here.

454
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:21,879
Fuck off!

00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:25,276
Watch the video. Watch it...

456
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:28,990
and tell me if you still think Alex,
"from the bar", isn't gay.

457
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:45,470
Well?

458
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:49,120
You... are really pathetic.

459
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:50,713
D'you know that?

460
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:51,790
Am I?

461
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:52,870
Mmm.

462
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:54,075
At least I'm not gay.

463
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,952
Absolutely nothin' wrong with it.

<i>Unless...</i>

465
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:01,079
Unless you're pretending you're not gay

466
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:03,879
so you can trick girls
into having sex with you.

467
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:06,349
Why would anyone do that?

468
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:08,397
Where's me phone?

469
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:10,232
It's down the toilet.

470
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:13,119
But don't worry, I didn't flush.

471
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:16,879
He's gay and you know it.

472
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:18,917
Nothing wrong with it.

473
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:20,991

Thanks.

477
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:37,919
So, Alex,

478
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,673
what have you been doing this evening?

479
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:42,917
Nothing. Just... getting ready to go out.

480
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,115
Mmm.

481
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:46,595
Right, right.

482
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,514
We should, um, go back to yours.

483
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:54,876
- You wanna go back to mine?
- Is that a problem?

484
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:57,873
- No. I just thought we were...
- (MOUTHS)

485
00:26:57,960 --> 00:27:00,429
I... just thought...

486
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:02,999
...you wanted to go out.

487
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:06,233
I really...

488
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:09,873
...want to go back to yours.

489
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:14,595
OK.

490
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:15,676
OK?

491
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:17,512
Nice to meet you.

492
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:18,715
You too, Alex.

493
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:19,870
From the bar.

494
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:24,192
Fuck off.

495
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:29,399
I hate to say it,

496
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:32,950
but I think she's probably
gonna take him back to his flat...

497
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:34,189
and fuck his brains out.

498
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:44,474
You really like her, don't you?

499
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:47,759
I always have done.

500
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:50,878
Ever since me first day
on community service.

501
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:56,274
She acts all tough and she's not.
And I know I can make her happy.

502
00:27:57,920 --> 00:27:59,035
You don't wanna listen to this.

503
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:02,598
To be honest, it's nice to think
about something other than Dad.

504
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,276
I don't get out much.

505
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:17,518
There's something
I need to talk to you about.

00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:20,954

all sorts about me, hasn't he?

What've you told her, you, you shit?

512

Very cute.
She smells of strawberries and cream.

00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:53,594
I forbid you to even talk to her.

524
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:56,029
I have popped in to say hello, all right,

525
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:57,758
and to tell you how sorry I am
about your dad.

You cook?

00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:42,436
- 'Ey?
- What?

544
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:44,079
What?! Are you just gonna sit there

545
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:47,391
and let some friggin' Neanderthal
treat your sister like a piece of meat?

546
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:49,118
Worse... It's worse than a piece of meat.

547
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:50,713
He's treating her like a piece of fish.

548
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:52,757
She looks like she's enjoying herself.

549
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:54,319
Will she still be enjoying herself,
I wonder,

550
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:56,516
when you're taking her down
the AIDS clinic?

551
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:58,318
Jesus, what did you
have to say that for?

552
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:00,550
- Eurgh.
- You really think I should go over there?

553
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:01,596
Mmm.

554
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:03,518
Is? Is that what brothers do?

555
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:04,590
Well, yes, it is.

556
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:06,472
It's what they do when they don't want
their sisters to get AIDS.

557
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:09,230
All right, back me up.

558
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:11,311

I'm sorry, but I...

00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:31,559
I don't want you to get AIDS, OK?

566
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:33,153
Are you saying I've got AIDS?

- Urn...

I was, er...
I was just admiring your wardrobe.

578
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:57,670
Do you always go snooping
in guys' bedrooms?

579
00:31:57,760 --> 00:31:59,159
I wasn't snooping.

Am I gay?

Finn showed me this video

No!

590

He saw you. I didn't know anything
about it until he showed it to me.

591

What's on this video?

592
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:38,236
It shows you talking to this guy.

593

I didn't wanna believe it.

596

That's why I was so pissed off with him
at the bar.

597

And then we come back here,
and there's photos of you

Ssh!

722
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:57,918
I'm so proud of you.

723
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:01,597
Sit with me.

726
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:11,593
I should probably go.

727
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:12,835
No. No.

728
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:15,716
Stay.

729
00:41:17,080 --> 00:41:18,354
S...

730
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:19,475
Stay.

731
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:34,354
Hey.

732
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:37,150
It's OK.

733
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:40,113
It's OK.

734
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:43,913
It's all good.

Just so you know,
Alex, "from the bar", is so not gay.

00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:54,119
Great.

746
00:42:54,200 --> 00:42:56,430
I'm sure he'll make someone
a lovely husband.

747
00:42:56,520 --> 00:42:58,431
Or, should I say, "civil partner".

749
00:42:59,720 --> 00:43:02,758
The thing in the underground car park,
he was buying some gear.

00:43:02,840 --> 00:43:04,069
So he's a drug addict.

D'you know what? I really don't
give a fuck what he was doing.

What's going on?

754
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:16,232

Draw on my face, will you?
You little shit.

- Rudy, don't.
- Fuck off!

...wash off before the funeral.

769
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:54,591
I'm just thinking, some people,
that could look disrespectful.

770
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:55,790
You think(?)

771
00:43:55,880 --> 00:43:59,316
- You prick.
- Hey! Come on, now, mate. No-one's...

772
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:00,993
No-one's more upset about this
than me.

How's your sister doing, mate?
Cos I'm thinking... (GASPS)

776
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:12,238
You even think about
going anywhere near my sister

777
00:44:12,320 --> 00:44:13,833
and I'll kick the shit out of you.

778
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:16,719
- Oh...
- She's off limits, is that understood?

779
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:21,599
All right. If you really feel
that strongly about it...

780
00:44:23,360 --> 00:44:24,714
...I'll give her a pass.

781
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:26,552
- I'm issuing her with a pass.
- Good.

782
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:29,433
Consider it issued, not a problem.

783

Listen to me. I'm not gonna hurt you.

784
00:44:51,160 --> 00:44:53,231
I promise I'm not gonna hurt you.

Show me your cock and I'll let you go.

00:44:55,840 --> 00:44:57,513
Show me your cock.
