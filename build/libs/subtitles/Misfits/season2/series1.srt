1
00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:03,680
- What is going on with this weather?
- What is that?

2
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:08,190
The storm, that lightning,
it's done something to us.

3
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:09,680
It's happened to me,

4
00:00:09,969 --> 00:00:11,957
I'm invisible.
Look at me!

5
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:16,520
- Time went backwards.
- What, you turned back time?

6
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:20,562
- I've got to have sex with you, now!
- What is happening to me?

7
00:00:20,682 --> 00:00:22,480
Everyone can do something except me.

8
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:25,160
You killed him!

9
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:27,173
If there's no body,
there's no crime.

10
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:29,360
This breaches the terms of my ASBO.

11
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:33,240
Don't use your power on me.
I'm already there.

12
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:34,800
Do you want to go for a drink?

13
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:36,800
I'm your probation worker.

14
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:38,600
You were just using me.

15
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:46,880
Save me, Barry!

16
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:56,200
You've gotta save him,
he's not allowed to die!

17
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:00,204
I've got a power!

18
00:01:00,883 --> 00:01:02,320
Who's laughing now?

19
00:01:03,092 --> 00:01:04,092
Help!

20
00:01:04,212 --> 00:01:05,212
I'm alive!

21
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:09,010
You buried me alive, you dicks!

22
00:03:26,301 --> 00:03:27,703
You fucker!

23
00:03:29,041 --> 00:03:30,160
My fucking eye!

- It could be a trap.
- Right.

30
00:04:40,857 --> 00:04:43,800
We're here five minutes
and someone's setting a trap for us.

31
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:45,640
It's too early for this bullshit.

32
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:48,320
It's a wind-up.
Who uses a paper aeroplane?

33
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:51,880
- They're going to get a slap.
- I don't think you should slap them.

34
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:53,280
It's like saying hello.

35
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:56,080
- Are you trying to say something?
- No.

36
00:04:59,886 --> 00:05:00,960
Who are you?

37
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:03,080
I'm your new probation worker.

38
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:04,880
What happened to the other one?

39
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:06,640
Apparently she's missing.

40
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:10,362
Now, this is where I'm supposed
to make a big speech

41
00:05:10,482 --> 00:05:12,640
about you
paying your debt to society

42
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,481
and making a difference.

43
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:18,160
But seriously, we've all got things
we'd rather be doing.

44
00:05:18,458 --> 00:05:19,640
See your mates?

45
00:05:21,642 --> 00:05:23,240
A little drug use?

46
00:05:25,054 --> 00:05:28,200
Making love
to your beautiful Italian girlfriend?

47
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:31,042
I'm talking about me.

48
00:05:31,363 --> 00:05:34,623
Now, let's just get through it
and get out of here, all right?

49
00:05:37,368 --> 00:05:38,566
That's different.

50
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:47,640
Who are they?

51
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:49,600
It's an art therapy class.

52
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:53,320
They're mentals?

53
00:05:54,745 --> 00:05:56,503
You want to say that a bit louder?

54
00:05:56,623 --> 00:05:58,680
I don't think
the weird-looking one heard you.

55
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:04,720
Just try and treat them
with some sensitivity and respect.

56
00:06:07,522 --> 00:06:08,720
Even that one...

57
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,470
Think you can manage that?

58
00:06:25,082 --> 00:06:27,089
So, what do you want us to do?

59
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:33,120
For starters,
paint over that piece of shit.

60
00:06:48,796 --> 00:06:50,546
I can't believe it's you.

61
00:06:56,170 --> 00:06:58,960
I tried to see you
after you'd left the unit.

62
00:06:59,888 --> 00:07:02,438
They wouldn't give me
your phone number.

63
00:07:02,924 --> 00:07:05,129
Didn't you get
the letters I wrote you?

64
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,747
Why didn't you visit me?

65
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:13,640
They said I shouldn't have
any contact with the patients.

66
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:14,800
I knew it.

67
00:07:15,322 --> 00:07:17,120
I knew you wanted to see me.

68
00:07:18,145 --> 00:07:19,445
I think about you...

69
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:20,950
all the time.

70
00:07:22,762 --> 00:07:24,320
Do you think about me?

71
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,080
Come see me tonight.

72
00:07:29,049 --> 00:07:30,322
I'm busy tonight.

73
00:07:30,442 --> 00:07:33,162
You have to come,
there's so much I want to tell you.

74
00:07:33,550 --> 00:07:34,600
Promise me.

75
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:45,564
I should go.

76
00:07:50,427 --> 00:07:51,477
I miss you.

77
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:01,850
It's good to see you.

78
00:08:25,875 --> 00:08:27,680
This is a complete waste of time.

79
00:08:49,656 --> 00:08:51,256
<i>Take it to the edge.</i>

80
00:08:53,282 --> 00:08:55,400
<i>Pull it back, pull it back...</i>

81
00:08:56,274 --> 00:08:58,719
<i>make it last, you little tease!</i>

82
00:08:59,246 --> 00:09:00,640
<i>Crank it up!</i>

83
00:09:03,124 --> 00:09:05,682
<i>You love it, you beautiful bastard!</i>

84
00:09:05,802 --> 00:09:06,852
He's alive.

85
00:09:19,497 --> 00:09:21,440
- He's dead.
- I heard him.

86
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,280
He was knocking one out.

87
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:24,920
That does sound like him.

88
00:09:25,613 --> 00:09:26,960
You just wanted to hear him.

89
00:09:27,673 --> 00:09:28,673
He's gone.

90
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:38,920
What the fuck?

91
00:09:41,626 --> 00:09:43,120
You should see your faces.

92
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:45,120
Classic!

93
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:46,969
Guess what?

94
00:09:49,230 --> 00:09:50,380
I'm immortal!

95
00:09:51,425 --> 00:09:52,840
Can you believe it?

96
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,750
I told you I had a power.

97
00:09:56,322 --> 00:09:58,842
Looks like they saved
the best for last.

98
00:09:58,962 --> 00:10:00,960
Immortality.
That's off the A list.

99
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:02,800
You stupid wanker!

100
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:05,480
- Stop hitting me!
- I thought you were dead!

101
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:07,280
<i>I thought I'd never see her again.</i>

102
00:10:08,121 --> 00:10:10,320
So if you're not dead,
how come you smell so bad?

103
00:10:10,794 --> 00:10:12,160
I have shat myself.

104
00:10:12,997 --> 00:10:15,905
- Were you having a wank in there?
- So what if I was?

105
00:10:16,656 --> 00:10:19,430
A man can't enjoy
a quick shuffle in his own coffin?

106
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:21,960
It's not like
I was expecting visitors.

107
00:10:22,525 --> 00:10:25,040
And you, you little freak!

108
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,320
What was that on the roof?

109
00:10:27,861 --> 00:10:29,120
I tried to save you.

110
00:10:29,570 --> 00:10:31,880
You failed spectacularly,
didn't you?

111
00:10:35,964 --> 00:10:37,164
I need to eat.

112
00:10:37,578 --> 00:10:39,160
Has anyone got a kebab?

113
00:10:40,022 --> 00:10:41,640
Do you want some chewing gum?

114
00:10:43,090 --> 00:10:44,080
Tutti-frutti?

115
00:10:44,769 --> 00:10:45,840
I like it.

116
00:10:52,443 --> 00:10:55,880
That was a bad scene in there.
I thought I'd starve to death.

117
00:10:56,566 --> 00:10:58,960
You're immortal,
you can't starve to death.

118
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:01,240
You're an expert?

119
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:03,520
So, what are you going to do now?

120
00:11:04,322 --> 00:11:07,022
I should probably tell my mum
I'm immortal.

121
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:09,260
Catch you later?

122
00:11:20,351 --> 00:11:22,524
So, my mum opens the door
and she's like:

123
00:11:24,761 --> 00:11:27,062
I'm like, "I'm immortal!"

124
00:11:27,318 --> 00:11:28,668
Then she fainted.

125
00:11:28,788 --> 00:11:32,320
Faceplants on the radiator.
There's blood and teeth everywhere.

126
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:34,980
- Is she all right?
- Yeah, she's fine.

127
00:11:35,675 --> 00:11:38,232
Apart from the whole face.

128
00:11:38,631 --> 00:11:40,440
Kinda put a downer
on the whole thing.

129
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:43,240
- How did you tell it to your dad?
- I told him I faked my death

130
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:45,792
as part of an elaborate life
insurance scam.

131
00:11:45,912 --> 00:11:47,562
He was not a happy man.

132
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:49,220
Who are you?

133
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:52,400
I could ask you the same thing.

134
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:53,960
I'm the probation worker.

135
00:11:57,486 --> 00:11:58,800
Nathan Young.

136
00:12:02,027 --> 00:12:03,320
They told me you were dead.

137
00:12:04,039 --> 00:12:05,039
Really?

138
00:12:06,803 --> 00:12:09,403
Apparently not.
Could a dead man do this?

139
00:12:22,590 --> 00:12:24,920
Well, I'll put you
back in the system.

140
00:12:26,010 --> 00:12:26,840
What?

141
00:12:27,352 --> 00:12:28,920
I was out of the system?

142
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:30,265
I was a free man?

143
00:12:30,385 --> 00:12:32,680
If I didn't show up,
no-one would've look for me?

144
00:12:33,187 --> 00:12:34,937
We thought you were dead.

145
00:12:37,431 --> 00:12:38,481
You prick.

146
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:48,718
Where were you?

147
00:12:48,838 --> 00:12:52,280
I waited for you.
You promised.

148
00:12:52,790 --> 00:12:54,768
There was something we had to do.

149
00:12:59,262 --> 00:13:00,520
Were you with them?

150
00:13:02,361 --> 00:13:03,411
I should...

151
00:13:12,637 --> 00:13:14,387
- Do you know her?
- No.

152
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:17,520
- Are you trying to shag her?
- She's not that mentally ill.

153
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:20,440
- Or maybe she is.
- Shut up.

154
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:23,080
No offence.
A lot of people say I'm mentally ill.

155
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:26,520
Obviously I'm not,
cause I'm here, and you're there.

156
00:13:27,027 --> 00:13:28,400
With the other crazies.

157
00:14:03,538 --> 00:14:04,960
What are you doing?

158
00:14:06,973 --> 00:14:08,080
I'm seducing you.

159
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:10,980
I'm being all...

160
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:12,760
slutty, and horny.

161
00:14:23,670 --> 00:14:25,240
You're with Curtis.

162
00:14:28,485 --> 00:14:30,135
Curtis and me are over.

163
00:14:31,489 --> 00:14:32,840
He didn't satisfy me.

164
00:14:35,164 --> 00:14:36,164
Sexually.

165
00:14:40,649 --> 00:14:41,840
What're you doing?

166
00:14:42,486 --> 00:14:44,400
I don't think you
should be doing that.

167
00:14:44,819 --> 00:14:46,719
You shouldn't be doing that.

168
00:14:48,001 --> 00:14:49,440
Hello, big boy.

169
00:15:18,702 --> 00:15:20,002
Catch you later.

170
00:16:14,486 --> 00:16:16,200
So did you cry at my funeral?

171
00:16:17,059 --> 00:16:18,960
I bet lots of girls were crying,

172
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:21,212
wishing they'd shagged me
while I was alive.

173
00:16:21,332 --> 00:16:23,760
Too late, ladies.
This ship has sailed.

174
00:16:24,110 --> 00:16:26,682
- You're such a dickhead.
- I missed you too.

175
00:16:41,604 --> 00:16:42,924
I'm no good at this...

176
00:16:43,044 --> 00:16:46,063
serious, girl stuff,
feelings and shit.

177
00:16:46,983 --> 00:16:48,083
I fancy you.

178
00:16:50,114 --> 00:16:51,040
Thanks.

179
00:16:53,531 --> 00:16:55,381
And obviously you fancy me.

180
00:16:56,201 --> 00:16:57,440
So the question is,

181
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,877
when are we going to...
seal the deal?

182
00:16:59,997 --> 00:17:02,216
Because it's going to happen.
I know it.

183
00:17:02,336 --> 00:17:04,052
You know it.
They know it.

184
00:17:05,758 --> 00:17:06,758
Tonight.

185
00:17:08,341 --> 00:17:09,120
Really?

186
00:17:10,244 --> 00:17:12,400
Just like that?
We're going to...?

187
00:17:15,741 --> 00:17:17,039
You won't regret it.

188
00:17:43,606 --> 00:17:44,520
What?

189
00:17:45,542 --> 00:17:46,920
Do you like food?

190
00:17:47,428 --> 00:17:48,920
Do I like food?

191
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:51,000
I mean... eating.

192
00:17:51,937 --> 00:17:55,200
We could go for a pizza,
and some garlic dough balls.

193
00:17:57,050 --> 00:17:58,600
Are you asking me out?

194
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:04,680
I think about you.
Not just since you...

195
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:06,290
You think about me?

196
00:18:09,268 --> 00:18:10,880
Have you been wanking over me?

197
00:18:12,979 --> 00:18:14,480
If you wank over someone,

198
00:18:15,535 --> 00:18:17,480
wank over Kelly, yeah?

199
00:18:18,259 --> 00:18:19,080
Freak.

200
00:18:22,373 --> 00:18:24,323
Why are you doing this to me?

201
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:31,040
I was just getting some condoms.
You know, for later.

202
00:18:31,825 --> 00:18:35,546
So, are we just doing it the once,
or will we be at it all night?

203
00:18:36,055 --> 00:18:37,705
Should I get two packs?

204
00:18:39,107 --> 00:18:40,680
It depends on how good you are.

205
00:18:43,147 --> 00:18:44,400
What have you got?

206
00:18:46,042 --> 00:18:47,442
Let's have a look.

207
00:18:48,535 --> 00:18:49,585
Get it out.

208
00:18:50,873 --> 00:18:53,080
You want to see the merchandise.
I get it.

209
00:18:54,053 --> 00:18:55,874
Try before you buy.

210
00:19:02,591 --> 00:19:03,480
Is that it?

211
00:19:05,455 --> 00:19:06,720
I haven't another one.

212
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:08,120
You call that a cock?

213
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:10,795
- What would you call it?
- I'd call it pathetic.

214
00:19:10,915 --> 00:19:12,920
I don't shag guys with tiny cocks.

215
00:19:14,073 --> 00:19:15,140
Forget it.

216
00:19:29,091 --> 00:19:30,560
I've never had any complaints.

217
00:19:31,617 --> 00:19:32,827
Well, maybe a few.

218
00:19:32,947 --> 00:19:36,514
Perhaps it wouldn't be a problem
if you didn't have a massive fanny.

219
00:19:36,634 --> 00:19:37,956
What are you talking about?

220
00:19:38,076 --> 00:19:40,215
I'm talking
about your jumbo size twat.

221
00:19:40,335 --> 00:19:42,066
I fucking hate you sometimes!

222
00:19:42,186 --> 00:19:44,880
You started it!
I have feelings.

223
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:46,770
And so does my cock!

224
00:20:16,687 --> 00:20:18,617
Something is going
on with these kids.

225
00:20:18,737 --> 00:20:22,005
Their last two probation workers
have disappeared. They just vanished.

226
00:20:23,155 --> 00:20:24,949
I know these type of kids.

227
00:20:25,069 --> 00:20:26,960
They're annoying, lazy idiots.

228
00:20:27,239 --> 00:20:28,720
They're not murderers.

229
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:30,420
I want to search the building.

230
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:34,654
- Have you got a warrant?
- Do I need one?

231
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:36,633
I'll get one.

232
00:20:36,753 --> 00:20:39,600
You better hope
they don't get to you first.

233
00:20:39,989 --> 00:20:41,120
I'm shitting my pants.

234
00:20:58,903 --> 00:21:00,080
What's happened?

235
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:06,800
Alisha, look at me. Look at me!
Who did this to you?

236
00:21:10,448 --> 00:21:11,480
He attacked me.

237
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:13,782
What?
Why would he attack you?

238
00:21:13,902 --> 00:21:15,118
I don't know.

239
00:21:16,016 --> 00:21:17,640
He's insane.

240
00:21:20,867 --> 00:21:22,392
I'll kill him.

241
00:21:58,832 --> 00:22:00,350
What's going on?

242
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:06,320
Nothing.

243
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:08,880
I should finish you!

244
00:22:10,836 --> 00:22:13,360
- I'm sorry!
- Why'd you hurt Alisha like that?

245
00:22:13,796 --> 00:22:15,880
- I never hurt her...
- Don't fucking lie!

246
00:22:17,158 --> 00:22:18,800
This is going to be interesting.

247
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:21,760
- I want to get comfortable.
- Why are you looking at me like that?

248
00:22:22,239 --> 00:22:23,720
What're you doin'?

249
00:22:25,933 --> 00:22:27,560
- What happened to the blood?
- What?

250
00:22:29,067 --> 00:22:30,165
Did you hit him?

251
00:22:30,285 --> 00:22:31,509
He attacked Alisha.

252
00:22:31,629 --> 00:22:32,560
No he didn't.

253
00:22:32,836 --> 00:22:34,067
In the locker room.

254
00:22:34,187 --> 00:22:36,480
Your face was all messed up.
You said he attacked you.

255
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:37,960
What are you talking about?

256
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:41,520
You hit him again, I'll kick your balls
back into your stomach, mate.

257
00:22:42,027 --> 00:22:43,800
I think he's been wanking over me.

258
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:47,120
I haven't!

259
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:48,520
It's not very convincing.

260
00:22:49,607 --> 00:22:51,793
<i>He doesn't know
Alisha gave me oral sex.</i>

261
00:22:52,732 --> 00:22:54,480
She gave you a blow job?

262
00:22:56,311 --> 00:22:57,880
I read him.
He says you sucked him.

263
00:22:58,040 --> 00:22:59,400
What the fuck is going on?

264
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:02,240
If I was going to suck someone,
trust me, it wouldn't be him.

265
00:23:04,072 --> 00:23:05,360
Are you going to cry?

266
00:23:05,819 --> 00:23:07,240
Be straight with us.

267
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:08,880
Did she give you a nosh?

268
00:23:11,067 --> 00:23:14,200
Whoever that was sucking your cock,
it wasn't me.

269
00:23:15,128 --> 00:23:16,800
Something weird's going on.

270
00:23:17,477 --> 00:23:18,880
I guess it's your fault.

271
00:23:32,052 --> 00:23:33,520
Is that the probation worker?

272
00:23:35,607 --> 00:23:36,640
You killed her?

273
00:23:38,045 --> 00:23:39,395
She was after us.

274
00:23:39,871 --> 00:23:43,021
She was engaged to Tony,
the first probation worker.

275
00:23:44,661 --> 00:23:46,636
She found out about us killing him.

276
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:49,312
What, so you kill her?

277
00:23:49,925 --> 00:23:52,640
That's brilliant.
Problem solved!

278
00:23:53,583 --> 00:23:55,483
She was going to the police.

279
00:23:55,804 --> 00:23:58,080
I didn't mean to kill her.
It was an accident.

280
00:24:00,286 --> 00:24:02,236
You're a weird little psycho,

281
00:24:02,607 --> 00:24:04,407
and now everyone knows it.

282
00:24:07,931 --> 00:24:10,381
Don't walk away.
This is on all of us.

283
00:24:11,519 --> 00:24:13,560
I thought
we were through with this shit.

284
00:24:18,839 --> 00:24:20,960
I don't know what is
going on with my guts.

285
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:25,466
It's all hot cross buns and Easter Eggs
when Jesus gets resurrected.

286
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:28,320
- That wasn't Nathan?
- Whoever it was,

287
00:24:28,868 --> 00:24:30,760
they know we killed
our probation workers.

288
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:32,882
Did someone kill
our probation worker?

289
00:24:35,839 --> 00:24:39,839
Seriously? I spend a few hours
in the toilet and I miss all that?

290
00:24:39,959 --> 00:24:41,839
Life is just passing me by.

291
00:24:41,959 --> 00:24:43,120
Who was that just now?

292
00:24:44,226 --> 00:24:45,680
I think it's a shape shifter.

293
00:24:46,795 --> 00:24:49,675
They can take on
other people's appearance.

294
00:24:50,274 --> 00:24:51,991
I saw it in an episode of Star Trek.

295
00:24:52,111 --> 00:24:54,273
You should watch
more science fiction stuff

296
00:24:54,393 --> 00:24:56,885
might actually figure out
what's going on round here.

297
00:24:57,261 --> 00:24:58,302
So that wasn't you

298
00:24:58,422 --> 00:25:00,800
who said those hurtful things
about the size of my cock?

299
00:25:04,595 --> 00:25:07,464
Then you're probably wondering
why I said you had a...

300
00:25:08,694 --> 00:25:09,640
huge fanny.

301
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:13,182
There may have been
a bit of a mix-up.

302
00:25:14,710 --> 00:25:16,395
We should set up a password,

303
00:25:16,750 --> 00:25:18,951
that we can say to each other
so we know it's us.

304
00:25:19,071 --> 00:25:20,074
"Monkey slut".

305
00:25:20,194 --> 00:25:22,098
We're not having "monkey slut"
as a password.

306
00:25:22,218 --> 00:25:25,044
What are the chances of that
being used in a normal conversation?

307
00:25:25,164 --> 00:25:26,440
Kinda low, no?

308
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:27,709
Just go with it.

309
00:25:28,355 --> 00:25:29,320
"Monkey slut".

310
00:25:35,750 --> 00:25:38,096
We need to find out who it is
before they go to the police.

311
00:25:38,216 --> 00:25:41,635
It's the new probation worker.
It's always the probation worker.

312
00:25:41,965 --> 00:25:44,493
That dead chick
was the probation worker's fiancee.

313
00:25:44,613 --> 00:25:46,817
What if this new one's his brother?

314
00:25:46,937 --> 00:25:48,080
He's white.

315
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:49,412
Tony was black.

316
00:25:49,988 --> 00:25:51,275
Adopted brother?

317
00:25:51,395 --> 00:25:53,195
Adopted kids are nut jobs.

318
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:01,280
Or her.

319
00:26:07,676 --> 00:26:09,281
I will see you tomorrow.

320
00:26:09,401 --> 00:26:11,680
Yeah, good one.
Very convincing.

321
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:18,080
You think
you can dick around with us!

322
00:26:23,968 --> 00:26:25,960
Change back into your fuckin' self!

323
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:27,640
Kick her again! Kick her again!

324
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:30,520
She has me!

325
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:34,120
Get her off me!

326
00:26:41,158 --> 00:26:44,560
Lick my salty balls,
you cock-loving, ball-sucking bitch!

327
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:46,200
Shut up!

328
00:27:17,623 --> 00:27:18,440
She's dead.

329
00:27:23,628 --> 00:27:24,680
We've killed him.

330
00:27:25,675 --> 00:27:27,480
Look, you had to do it.

331
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:28,880
She was going to kill me.

332
00:27:30,253 --> 00:27:31,360
You're immortal!

333
00:27:33,170 --> 00:27:35,520
I thought she'd turn back
into herself when she died.

334
00:27:41,429 --> 00:27:44,464
There's no way that's
actually the probation worker.

335
00:27:47,279 --> 00:27:48,960
I think it might be.

336
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:57,400
Can we please stop
killing our probation workers?

337
00:28:12,462 --> 00:28:15,360
That dead chick was that other
probation worker's fiancee, right?

338
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:17,395
What if this new one's his brother?

339
00:28:17,515 --> 00:28:19,395
He's white.
Tony was black.

340
00:28:19,978 --> 00:28:22,280
Adopted brother?
Adopted kids are nut jobs.

341
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:25,000
Wait!

342
00:28:27,204 --> 00:28:29,480
Right.
I will see you tomorrow.

343
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:31,520
Good one.
Very convincing.

344
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:32,600
It's not her.

345
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:43,200
What's going on?

346
00:28:46,493 --> 00:28:47,497
Nothing.

347
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:52,522
You're obviously lying.

348
00:28:55,781 --> 00:28:58,320
But it's five o'clock
and I couldn't give a shit.

349
00:28:59,750 --> 00:29:01,220
Have a good one!

350
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:15,487
Where's she?

351
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:18,871
She's a mouse!

352
00:29:27,725 --> 00:29:29,131
Get some cheese!

353
00:29:29,251 --> 00:29:31,083
Are you fuckin' serious?

354
00:29:36,654 --> 00:29:39,160
So what's the story
with you and this girl?

355
00:29:40,135 --> 00:29:42,985
After I tried to burn
that boy's house down...

356
00:29:45,126 --> 00:29:47,555
they sent me
to a psychiatric unit for assessment.

357
00:29:47,675 --> 00:29:49,625
Really?
I can't imagine why.

358
00:29:53,457 --> 00:29:55,507
Lucy was a patient in the unit.

359
00:29:57,145 --> 00:29:58,480
She's obsessed with me.

360
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:01,206
So it's just that
and the murder, is it?

361
00:30:01,326 --> 00:30:03,600
Or is there anything else
you'd like to share?

362
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:06,560
You expect me to tell you anything
after how you've treated me?

363
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:08,560
- The names you've called me?
- What names?

364
00:30:09,772 --> 00:30:10,600
Weird kid.

365
00:30:11,016 --> 00:30:12,000
Panty sniffer.

366
00:30:12,289 --> 00:30:14,560
Virgin. Freak.
Twat.

367
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:16,389
Pervert.
Paedophile.

368
00:30:17,563 --> 00:30:18,897
Melon fucker.

369
00:30:21,652 --> 00:30:23,549
I just want to be your friend.

370
00:30:29,326 --> 00:30:31,120
Sure, man.

371
00:30:32,436 --> 00:30:33,574
All right.

372
00:30:42,857 --> 00:30:46,520
You just know Curtis is going to
get all freaked out over the whole...

373
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:50,170
It wasn't even me!

374
00:30:53,192 --> 00:30:55,520
One of my exes
was watching a porno, yeah?

375
00:30:55,961 --> 00:30:59,515
He saw a girl who looked like me
getting shagged by a load of dwarfs.

376
00:30:59,874 --> 00:31:01,440
Did his head in.
That was it.

377
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:03,080
Over.

378
00:31:16,577 --> 00:31:20,160
So, basically, he's had a blow job
off your girlfriend and you haven't?

379
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:21,440
It wasn't her.

380
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:23,240
- It looked like her.
- It wasn't.

381
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:25,080
- It had her mouth.
- Not her brain.

382
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:27,960
Who cares about her brain
when your balls are resting on her chin?

383
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:29,276
Say another word!

384
00:31:30,313 --> 00:31:31,973
I dare you.
Do it.

385
00:31:32,653 --> 00:31:33,960
I didn't do anything!

386
00:31:34,187 --> 00:31:35,520
Be angry with him!

387
00:31:38,161 --> 00:31:41,360
I didn't know what was happening.
She just...

388
00:31:42,510 --> 00:31:43,880
Then she...

389
00:31:45,227 --> 00:31:47,237
- Before I knew it, she was...
- Sucking your cock!

390
00:31:47,357 --> 00:31:50,040
You didn't know it wasn't Alisha.
You should've stopped her.

391
00:31:50,886 --> 00:31:51,876
Be serious.

392
00:31:51,996 --> 00:31:54,560
That requires
an inhuman level of self-restraint

393
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:56,355
that no man is capable of.

394
00:31:56,779 --> 00:32:00,120
The siren call of the blow-job
renders all men powerless.

395
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:02,551
That's how girls trick you
into marrying them.

396
00:32:04,052 --> 00:32:04,937
Mouse!

397
00:32:17,158 --> 00:32:18,637
Split up!
Find her!

398
00:32:58,912 --> 00:32:59,781
Gotcha.

399
00:33:04,176 --> 00:33:05,480
I got the bitch!

400
00:33:12,577 --> 00:33:13,977
Jesus, I've killed her!

401
00:33:14,237 --> 00:33:17,115
Do something!
Give her mouth to mouth or something.

402
00:33:17,589 --> 00:33:18,520
I hate mice.

403
00:33:20,808 --> 00:33:22,560
The password... monkey slut!

404
00:33:23,625 --> 00:33:24,504
What?

405
00:33:26,549 --> 00:33:28,080
It's you!

406
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:30,446
It's not you!

407
00:33:32,572 --> 00:33:33,900
Guys! Guys!

408
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:55,862
Come on!

409
00:34:19,006 --> 00:34:20,206
Monkey slut!

410
00:34:21,753 --> 00:34:22,929
Help!

411
00:34:36,026 --> 00:34:37,680
It's him. She's Barry!

412
00:34:38,022 --> 00:34:39,760
She shoved me onto a pipe.

413
00:34:39,990 --> 00:34:40,880
I'm not her.

414
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:42,159
I'm me.

415
00:34:43,606 --> 00:34:45,360
Then I'm really confused.

416
00:34:47,791 --> 00:34:48,639
Monkey slut.

417
00:34:48,921 --> 00:34:50,200
Shit! Does that hurt?

418
00:34:50,672 --> 00:34:52,067
Only when I breathe.

419
00:34:57,400 --> 00:34:58,360
Is that her?

420
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:00,852
That's just a mouse.

421
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:03,400
The bad news is, the mental girl,

422
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:04,720
she knows the password.

423
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:07,085
Monkey slut is blown.

424
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:13,258
She could be any one of us.

425
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:16,737
I think you can...

426
00:35:16,975 --> 00:35:18,040
rule me out.

427
00:35:22,805 --> 00:35:24,680
- It's not me.
- It's not me either.

428
00:35:28,166 --> 00:35:29,166
Prove it.

429
00:35:29,789 --> 00:35:30,880
Use your power.

430
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:40,880
I want to rub my cock
in your hairy armpit.

431
00:35:43,490 --> 00:35:44,560
Happy now?

432
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:49,624
Cock, armpit.

433
00:35:49,859 --> 00:35:51,146
It wasn't pretty.

434
00:35:52,618 --> 00:35:54,118
Right, you're up.

435
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:55,760
Do your thing.

436
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:10,357
Monkey slut.

437
00:36:11,568 --> 00:36:12,480
No way!

438
00:36:13,913 --> 00:36:15,080
That's not Curtis.

439
00:36:16,324 --> 00:36:18,040
- I can hear her thinking.
- What?

440
00:36:18,255 --> 00:36:19,680
If you're you, rewind time.

441
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:21,556
You know it doesn't work like that.

442
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:27,360
I'm gonna find Curtis.

443
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:38,960
What do we do with her?

444
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:40,513
Only one thing we can do.

445
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:50,040
- That's pretty brutal.
- We can't kill her.

446
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:51,243
She knows too much.

447
00:37:08,616 --> 00:37:09,835
What was that?

448
00:37:10,301 --> 00:37:11,803
Is something happening?

449
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:39,200
Who is it?

450
00:37:42,437 --> 00:37:43,360
It's you.

451
00:38:04,598 --> 00:38:06,120
Why are you doing this?

452
00:38:06,938 --> 00:38:09,485
These new friends you've made...

453
00:38:10,653 --> 00:38:13,119
They've turned you against me.

454
00:38:16,277 --> 00:38:18,346
I know what I need to do now.

455
00:38:20,157 --> 00:38:22,120
You're going to walk
into the police station

456
00:38:23,690 --> 00:38:26,680
and confess to murdering
your probation worker.

457
00:38:27,377 --> 00:38:28,920
They'll lock you up in the unit.

458
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:30,977
We'll be together again.

459
00:39:03,228 --> 00:39:04,799
I'm doing this for us.

460
00:39:18,019 --> 00:39:19,120
Don't worry about me.

461
00:39:19,524 --> 00:39:20,640
I'll just...

462
00:39:21,182 --> 00:39:22,182
die...

463
00:39:23,147 --> 00:39:24,147
again.

464
00:40:09,669 --> 00:40:11,463
I shouldn't have blanked you.

465
00:40:15,108 --> 00:40:17,330
I should never have done that
to you.

466
00:40:19,783 --> 00:40:21,385
I know how much it hurts.

467
00:40:25,476 --> 00:40:27,213
I thought
they wouldn't be friends with me

468
00:40:27,333 --> 00:40:29,320
if they knew
about me being in the unit.

469
00:40:30,323 --> 00:40:31,370
Do you really think

470
00:40:31,490 --> 00:40:33,800
they're going to be friends
with someone like you?

471
00:40:38,809 --> 00:40:40,440
For the first time in my life,

472
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:43,680
I feel like I belong.

473
00:40:47,215 --> 00:40:48,640
I've never been this happy.

474
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:49,760
You murdered

475
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:51,658
your probation worker.

476
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:54,338
I didn't say it was perfect.

477
00:40:56,870 --> 00:40:58,651
You should have visited me.

478
00:41:07,472 --> 00:41:09,216
I couldn't go back to the unit.

479
00:41:10,062 --> 00:41:11,560
I can't go back.

480
00:41:13,018 --> 00:41:14,840
It's where you belong.

481
00:41:20,492 --> 00:41:22,390
I'm not that person any more.

482
00:41:24,634 --> 00:41:26,399
I like who I am now.

483
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:30,079
Don't take that away from me.

484
00:41:43,458 --> 00:41:45,259
Is there something
you want to tell me?

485
00:41:52,856 --> 00:41:54,858
Fuck you.

486
00:41:54,978 --> 00:41:56,271
Is this a wind-up?

487
00:41:56,391 --> 00:41:58,000
Of course it is, you prick!

488
00:41:58,760 --> 00:41:59,920
Get out of here, freak!

489
00:42:00,383 --> 00:42:02,551
I should do you
for wasting police time!

490
00:42:27,197 --> 00:42:28,402
I'll walk you home.

491
00:42:49,609 --> 00:42:51,628
So you didn't shit yourself
this time?

492
00:42:52,882 --> 00:42:54,157
Apparently not.

493
00:42:55,183 --> 00:42:56,406
So that's progress!

494
00:42:58,490 --> 00:42:59,920
That stuff I said about your...

495
00:43:00,742 --> 00:43:01,920
huge vagina.

496
00:43:04,902 --> 00:43:06,032
I didn't mean it.

497
00:43:06,322 --> 00:43:07,614
I'm sure it's a beauty.

498
00:43:10,001 --> 00:43:11,691
It's stuff you say all the time.

499
00:43:12,550 --> 00:43:13,800
It's just who you are.

500
00:43:14,236 --> 00:43:15,361
I can change.

501
00:43:17,252 --> 00:43:19,506
I just wanted to make sure
that you were okay.

502
00:43:48,120 --> 00:43:49,120
Cornettos!

503
00:44:01,301 --> 00:44:02,483
I've got to tell you,

504
00:44:02,603 --> 00:44:04,680
I'm loving
this whole immortality gig.

505
00:44:05,176 --> 00:44:06,768
So you don't mind
dying all the time?

506
00:44:06,888 --> 00:44:08,520
It's scary, and it's painful.

507
00:44:08,792 --> 00:44:10,924
My mum still can't get
the stains out of those trousers.

508
00:44:11,044 --> 00:44:12,640
But there's a definite upside.

509
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:14,440
You'll have to get a job forever?

510
00:44:14,795 --> 00:44:16,753
You could go a hundred years
without getting laid.

511
00:44:16,978 --> 00:44:18,480
Everyone you love will die.

512
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:20,110
Whatever!
In...

513
00:44:22,751 --> 00:44:25,160
six weeks, it's all going to change.

514
00:44:25,589 --> 00:44:27,128
What's happening in six weeks?

515
00:44:27,248 --> 00:44:29,040
We finish our Community Service.

516
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:31,360
- What're you gonna do then?
- I'm gonna join the circus.

517
00:44:32,760 --> 00:44:34,668
They can throw knives at me,
stick swords in me,

518
00:44:34,788 --> 00:44:35,896
shoot me in the face.

519
00:44:36,016 --> 00:44:37,733
People pay good money.

520
00:44:37,853 --> 00:44:39,280
And I'm making serious cash.

521
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:40,720
And where the cash goes,

522
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:41,966
the pussy follows.

523
00:44:42,086 --> 00:44:43,531
No offence, ladies.

524
00:44:47,026 --> 00:44:48,661
So who was it who saved your life?

525
00:44:50,077 --> 00:44:51,077
I don't know.

526
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:53,640
Some guy in a mask.

527
00:44:54,161 --> 00:44:56,680
The only reason I needed saving
is because you're all fucking idiots!

528
00:44:56,840 --> 00:44:58,560
Don't start on me,
I weren't even there!

529
00:44:58,720 --> 00:44:59,720
It was me.

530
00:45:02,829 --> 00:45:03,948
I saved you.

531
00:45:08,816 --> 00:45:09,816
How?

532
00:45:11,352 --> 00:45:13,640
Come on!
I'm joking! Seriously?

533
00:45:13,953 --> 00:45:15,080
Still a prick.

534
00:45:15,336 --> 00:45:16,640
Someone else knows about us.

535
00:45:18,002 --> 00:45:19,360
We need to find out who it is.

536
00:45:20,202 --> 00:45:22,040
Haven't we done enough for one week?

537
00:45:22,361 --> 00:45:24,464
We almost killed
another probation worker.

538
00:45:24,584 --> 00:45:26,720
You had your first blow job.
I died again.

539
00:45:27,381 --> 00:45:28,657
It's nearly the weekend,

540
00:45:28,777 --> 00:45:31,280
let's just dump her
and worry about that stuff next week.

541
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:33,040
Or maybe even the week after that.

542
00:45:34,118 --> 00:45:35,040
This will do.

543
00:45:36,502 --> 00:45:37,502
It's time.

544
00:46:06,520 --> 00:46:07,678
I'm looking for Nathan.

545
00:46:07,798 --> 00:46:09,240
- Who are you?
- His brother.

546
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:12,120
- How's that even possible?
- We've got the same dad.

547
00:46:12,280 --> 00:46:14,080
- Are you out of your mind?
- Fuck you!

548
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:17,224
He was there for you!
You don't know how this feels!

549
00:46:17,362 --> 00:46:20,040
We're like the Mitchell brothers!
Only we're not bald, ugly and shit!

550
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:24,760
I was just thinking about you.

551
00:46:25,960 --> 00:46:27,381
What are you doing?

552
00:46:28,320 --> 00:46:30,720
- Who is this guy?
- I don't know. He's following me.

553
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:32,520
What does he actually know?

554
00:46:32,680 --> 00:46:34,160
He seems to know everything.

555
00:46:34,320 --> 00:46:35,480
We need to find him.
