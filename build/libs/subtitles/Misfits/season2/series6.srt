1
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:04,599
This is awkward.

2
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:06,519
The cute, smiley, popular girl.

3
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:07,679
I think she murdered me.

4
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:10,199
So, you think that
if a girl likes me,

5
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:11,919
there must be something
wrong with her.

6
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:13,839
That's not what we're saying.
Dad!

7
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:17,839
She's my little...

8
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:20,239
Why are the coppers after you?

9
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:21,719
I didn't mean to hurt them.

10
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:24,039
I didn't mean to hurt anyone,
especially not you.

11
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:25,399
What are you doing?

12
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:29,399
Bruno!

13
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:34,479
You killed him!

14
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:41,959
# TCHAIKOVSKY:
Dance Of The Sugar Plum Fairy

15
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,319
How would you describe your ability?

16
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:58,959
I call it lacto-kinesis.

17
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:02,959
What's it like being called
the world's first superhero?

18
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:07,679
That has to be
the shittest power ever.

19
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:22,439
# The city breathing

20
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:24,239
# The people churning

21
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,519
# The conversating

22
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:29,519
# The price is what?

23
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:43,359
# The conversating

24
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:45,759
# This place is heaven

25
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:49,759
# If you see them! #

26
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:57,759
Hey, man.

27
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:00,319
I can't believe
this guy has gone public.

28
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:01,559
You better believe it.

29
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:03,559
Because he's going to
make a fortune.

30
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:05,399
Maybe we should think
about doing the same?

31
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:09,399
The early bird catches
the massive pay cheque.

32
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:10,879
Nice cock, man.

33
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:12,359
Fuck off.

34
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:14,479
I don't think going public's
a good idea.

35
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:18,079
Look, we finish our community
service in two days. Count them.

36
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:20,719
I don't know about you,
but I'm not exactly swamped

37
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,959
with lucrative job offers.

38
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:26,959
We need to think about
cashing in on our powers.

39
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:35,879
I mean, I'm immortal.

40
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:39,879
I shouldn't be flipping burgers,
I should be eating burgers,

41
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:42,559
massive burgers,
the size of my head.

42
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:45,999
Think about it, we could have
really cool superhero names.

43
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,239
Captain Invincible.

44
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:50,719
Mr Backwards.

45
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:53,599
I sound retarded.

46
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,759
The Invisible Cunt.

47
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:57,879
Why do I have to be
the Invisible Cunt?

48
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:00,199
Because you just are, man.
Get over it.

49
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:03,239
I mean, what's the point in
all of us having superpowers

50
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:05,959
if we can't use them
to make obscene amounts of money

51
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:08,599
and shag loads of drunk,
impressionable girls.

52
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:12,599
It's clearly what God intended for
us. I for one will not let him down.

53
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,959
Simon!
What?

54
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:26,679
What's going on
with you and Jessica?

55
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:30,679
After what happened with her dad,
she said she can't see me, so...

56
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:33,199
Seeing a girl
whose dad tried to kill you...

57
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:35,599
it's never going to work.

58
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,639
You'll meet someone else.

59
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:41,639
Trust me.

60
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,279
What was that?

61
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:00,879
They know what about us.

62
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:02,439
Who?

63
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:03,799
Everyone.

64
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:05,039
What are you talking about?

65
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:08,239
There are reporters and
TV cameras outside, lots of them.

66
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,679
Bullshit.

67
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:10,839
No way.

68
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:13,159
Are you serious?

69
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:15,599
Right. I think
I might take a little peek.

70
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:18,439
Don't open the door.

71
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:30,119
That was really
quite a lot of reporters.

72
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:33,839
How did they find out about us?

73
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:37,839
What? No, I didn't do anything.

74
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:40,799
I don't think I did.

75
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:44,799
I'm almost certain I didn't.

76
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:48,839
You!

77
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:52,759
You told them about us.

78
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:54,759
Yeah.

79
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:56,759
You sit on your arse
doing nothing for six weeks

80
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:57,799
and then you sell us out.

81
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:00,279
Looks like that, doesn't it?

82
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:02,239
Is that ironic?

83
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,719
Never too sure.

84
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:06,559
You're our probation worker.
You're supposed to sort us out.

85
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,359
I'm sure you'll be fine.

86
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:10,239
Like you give a shit.

87
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,839
That's a good point. See you.

88
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:14,519
Where you going?

89
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:16,879
Antigua. Hm.

90
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:20,879
So, this is goodbye,
so long, and fuck off.

91
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:25,079
Wanker!

92
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:29,719
I'm actually very surprised
that it hasn't happened sooner.

93
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,199
We haven't really been that careful.

94
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:35,079
What are they going to do to us?

95
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,639
They'll treat us like freaks.

96
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:40,079
They'll lock us up
in a secret military facility

97
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:41,519
and conduct experiments on us.

98
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:44,759
Hey, no-one's experimenting on me.
I'm not a monkey.

99
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:47,039
What are we going to do?

100
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:49,119
We have to go into hiding.

101
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:51,159
We assume new identities.

102
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:54,359
We break off all connection
with our family and friends.

103
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:56,959
We wear disguises
and only go out after dark.

104
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:59,479
I'm not loving the sound of that.

105
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:01,879
Do you expect me
never to see my mum again?

106
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:04,679
Who's going to do my washing? Huh?

107
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:07,039
You have not thought this through.

108
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:10,839
There is an alternative.

109
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:12,639
Who are you?

110
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:16,119
I'm the person who can make it
so you don't need to go into hiding.

111
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:20,119
If this is handled right,
you're all making some serious money.

112
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:32,639
What are you thinking?

113
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:35,399
This isn't why we got our powers.

114
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:37,839
No. There is no why,
there's only what.

115
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:40,679
What are we going to
spend all our money on?

116
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:42,719
None of us even know
what we're doing after.

117
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:47,839
It's better than signing on.
What about the people we killed?

118
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:53,959
I guess we should ask her
about that. -Yeah.

119
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:01,279
I'm not saying we have,

120
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:04,319
but what would happen,
hypothetically speaking,

121
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:08,319
if it came to light that we may
have killed one or two people?

122
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:13,959
Probation workers and such.
No-one important.

123
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:20,599
I would say that these people

124
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:22,559
you may or may not have killed

125
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:25,679
were evil.

126
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:27,239
You were protecting society.

127
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:31,239
You're not murderers.
You're heroes.

128
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:33,159
Superheroes.

129
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:37,159
Rich, famous superheroes.

130
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:39,119
And if that doesn't work,

131
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,959
we vanish the bodies
and pay off the relatives.

132
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:45,479
Good answer.

133
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:46,599
Sign us up.

134
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:48,079
Good.

135
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,639
We're making a mistake.

136
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:51,799
We should all stick together.

137
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:54,079
Just do it with us.

138
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:58,079
This will change everything.

139
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:05,879
Call me when you change your mind.

140
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:15,799
I don't know.

141
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:18,319
Do you trust her?

142
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:19,919
They're waiting for you.

143
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,879
They're calling you the ASBO Five.

144
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:23,599
I haven't even got an ASBO.

145
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,039
No-one cares.

146
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:28,399
OK, any questions you don't want
to answer, just let me handle it.

147
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:30,159
Teeth, good.

148
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:31,799
Hair, beautiful.

149
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:33,439
Cock, in.

150
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:36,839
Flies, up.

151
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:40,839
Let's go be famous.

152
00:11:09,946 --> 00:11:13,945
Hello, ladies!

153
00:11:18,826 --> 00:11:22,825
Phew!

154
00:11:25,626 --> 00:11:28,025
Laura, hi.

155
00:11:28,026 --> 00:11:31,265
Have we heard anything from the
French about this cheese deal?

156
00:11:31,266 --> 00:11:32,905
Do they know what I can do?

157
00:11:32,906 --> 00:11:36,305
They know. They're calling
you Monsieur Grande Fromage.

158
00:11:36,306 --> 00:11:37,585
Mr Big Cheese.

159
00:11:38,786 --> 00:11:41,385
Can we do this later?
I'm really busy right now.

160
00:11:41,386 --> 00:11:42,945
Have you got it?

161
00:11:42,946 --> 00:11:46,945
Take her straight to the hotel
and don't let her talk to anyone.

162
00:11:47,346 --> 00:11:50,105
How wonderful.
No, we're very excited.

163
00:12:08,106 --> 00:12:12,105
Ah!

164
00:12:14,186 --> 00:12:16,185
Jesus!

165
00:12:16,186 --> 00:12:17,905
Sorry.

166
00:12:17,906 --> 00:12:20,545
Why are you skulking
around in my bathroom?

167
00:12:20,546 --> 00:12:23,425
My parents are freaking out
about the invisible thing.

168
00:12:23,426 --> 00:12:25,545
I didn't have anywhere else to go.

169
00:12:25,546 --> 00:12:28,145
Can I stay with you?

170
00:12:28,146 --> 00:12:30,345
Sure, man.

171
00:12:30,346 --> 00:12:33,185
Hang back a few minutes, though.
I'm just going to go

172
00:12:33,186 --> 00:12:37,185
slip these girls one before
they sober up.

173
00:12:44,306 --> 00:12:45,465
Sorry I'm late.

174
00:12:45,466 --> 00:12:49,025
I was just enjoying the fruits of
our new-found fame and celebrity.

175
00:12:49,026 --> 00:12:52,025
You know I'm not actually
talking about fruit.

176
00:12:52,026 --> 00:12:55,465
Although you should see the
size of my fruit bowl... Massive!

177
00:12:55,466 --> 00:12:57,505
Did you shag those skanky girls?

178
00:12:57,506 --> 00:12:59,345
I most certainly did.

179
00:12:59,346 --> 00:13:01,345
Loving the canapes.

180
00:13:01,346 --> 00:13:04,385
I was just saying, if there's
anything you don't want to see

181
00:13:04,386 --> 00:13:08,065
in the papers, tell me now
and then I can deal with it.

182
00:13:08,066 --> 00:13:10,865
Everything about me has
already been in the papers.

183
00:13:10,866 --> 00:13:12,745
Do any of your
ex-boyfriends have

184
00:13:12,746 --> 00:13:14,985
any intimate photographs
or videos of you?

185
00:13:14,986 --> 00:13:17,665
I'll delete them.

186
00:13:17,666 --> 00:13:19,705
Make sure you do.

187
00:13:19,706 --> 00:13:23,185
Right. Is there anything
else I need to know?

188
00:13:23,186 --> 00:13:26,705
Yes?

189
00:13:26,706 --> 00:13:30,345
Just before I started
my Community Service,

190
00:13:30,346 --> 00:13:34,225
- there was an incident with this girl...
- What kind of incident?

191
00:13:34,226 --> 00:13:35,385
Really?

192
00:13:35,386 --> 00:13:38,025
I picked her up in this
dentist's waiting room.

193
00:13:38,026 --> 00:13:39,745
She was having
some kind of oral surgery.

194
00:13:39,746 --> 00:13:43,345
So we go out -
a few drinks, a couple of kebabs,

195
00:13:43,346 --> 00:13:46,865
then it's straight back to her place
and start with the shagging.

196
00:13:46,866 --> 00:13:48,425
I've built up a nice rhythm...

197
00:13:48,426 --> 00:13:50,865
I'm getting really close
to blowing my load,

198
00:13:50,866 --> 00:13:52,825
just hovering in the pleasure zone.

199
00:13:52,826 --> 00:13:55,345
And then BAM! All hell breaks lose.

200
00:13:55,346 --> 00:13:58,945
I tripled myself.

201
00:13:58,946 --> 00:14:01,745
I'm not familiar with that term.

202
00:14:01,746 --> 00:14:03,345
You know... Tripling.

203
00:14:03,346 --> 00:14:06,825
It's when you cum, puke and shit
yourself all at the same time.

204
00:14:06,826 --> 00:14:08,305
Fuck's sake!

205
00:14:08,306 --> 00:14:12,305
Three bodily functions.
Doing the triple.

206
00:14:13,186 --> 00:14:14,345
You're telling me that's
never happened to you?

207
00:14:14,346 --> 00:14:16,665
No.

208
00:14:16,666 --> 00:14:19,666
Anyway, I lied about my name,
so she probably doesn't even remember me.

209
00:14:19,786 --> 00:14:21,828
I don't think she's ever forgetting you.

210
00:14:23,746 --> 00:14:26,945
Anyone else?

211
00:14:26,946 --> 00:14:30,945
I shagged a monkey.

212
00:14:32,386 --> 00:14:36,385
Technically, it was a gorilla.

213
00:14:51,066 --> 00:14:52,305
What are we doing here?

214
00:14:52,306 --> 00:14:55,785
I wanted you to meet my other clients
and also some potential sponsors.

215
00:14:55,786 --> 00:14:59,505
Just relax and enjoy yourself.

216
00:14:59,506 --> 00:15:03,505
I should mingle.

217
00:15:03,826 --> 00:15:07,665
Laura.

218
00:15:09,386 --> 00:15:13,385
Down the wrong way.

219
00:15:15,466 --> 00:15:18,225
Hi.

220
00:15:18,226 --> 00:15:19,585
Good to see you.

221
00:15:19,586 --> 00:15:22,665
Oh, you're that milk guy, innit.

222
00:15:22,666 --> 00:15:24,145
It's not just milk.
It's all dairy products.

223
00:15:24,146 --> 00:15:26,945
So you're here to
make the coffees then?

224
00:15:26,946 --> 00:15:30,265
I'm done making other people coffee.
People make my coffee now.

225
00:15:30,266 --> 00:15:33,305
So what's the point
in having your power?

226
00:15:33,306 --> 00:15:36,665
Were you one of those fat kids
who had milk seeping out

227
00:15:36,666 --> 00:15:38,865
of his man boobs during puberty?

228
00:15:38,866 --> 00:15:40,345
No.

229
00:15:40,346 --> 00:15:44,345
We had a kid like him at our school.
We used to milk him every lunchtime.

230
00:15:44,506 --> 00:15:46,945
I wasn't one of those kids.

231
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:48,985
Get off me - what are you doing?
I'm milking you!

232
00:15:48,986 --> 00:15:50,025
Get off!

233
00:15:50,026 --> 00:15:53,025
This reminds me of school.
That was some good times.

234
00:15:53,026 --> 00:15:56,785
Fuck off!

235
00:15:56,786 --> 00:16:00,785
That's what the kid at my school used
to say and he had a nervous breakdown.

236
00:16:04,946 --> 00:16:06,145
Nathan.

237
00:16:06,146 --> 00:16:09,225
How would you feel about
blowing your brains out

238
00:16:09,226 --> 00:16:13,225
live on national television
tomorrow night?

239
00:16:16,186 --> 00:16:20,185
Yeah, I am definitely up for that.

240
00:16:20,666 --> 00:16:24,665
Another please.

241
00:16:30,666 --> 00:16:32,266
Hi.

242
00:16:38,026 --> 00:16:40,745
Be nice to him, yeah?

243
00:16:42,066 --> 00:16:46,065
I'm not promising anything,
but I'll definitely try.

244
00:16:46,666 --> 00:16:48,545
Maybe a tuxedo - what do you think?

245
00:16:48,546 --> 00:16:51,825
Why not? They're planning to
film it at the Community Centre.

246
00:16:51,826 --> 00:16:55,305
Right. It's like a whole
going back to my roots kind of vibe.

247
00:16:55,306 --> 00:16:55,945
Daisy! Daisy!

248
00:16:55,946 --> 00:16:59,945
Excuse me.

249
00:17:04,786 --> 00:17:05,505
Who's she?

250
00:17:05,506 --> 00:17:06,665
That's Daisy.

251
00:17:06,666 --> 00:17:09,345
More and more people with
powers are coming forward.

252
00:17:09,346 --> 00:17:10,745
What can she do?

253
00:17:10,746 --> 00:17:13,465
She can heal people -
any illness, any disease,

254
00:17:13,466 --> 00:17:15,825
she plans to cure the world.

255
00:17:15,826 --> 00:17:19,825
She's like a pretty, modern day
Mother Theresa with a superpower.

256
00:17:19,906 --> 00:17:23,105
She is going to make a fortune.

257
00:17:23,106 --> 00:17:25,825
Daisy! Daisy!

258
00:17:25,826 --> 00:17:26,665
That's far enough...

259
00:17:26,666 --> 00:17:30,665
No, no, let him through.

260
00:17:32,986 --> 00:17:34,585
What's your name?

261
00:17:34,586 --> 00:17:36,225
Neil.

262
00:17:36,226 --> 00:17:40,225
I'm just going to
touch your legs, OK?

263
00:17:48,426 --> 00:17:52,425
Steady!

264
00:18:07,546 --> 00:18:11,545
I'm walking.

265
00:18:16,826 --> 00:18:20,825
Thank you.

266
00:18:43,946 --> 00:18:47,945
Hi, honey.

267
00:18:50,986 --> 00:18:52,425
Where are you going?

268
00:18:52,426 --> 00:18:55,105
There's somewhere I need to be.

269
00:18:55,106 --> 00:18:58,465
I thought you liked me.

270
00:18:58,466 --> 00:19:00,545
Well...

271
00:19:00,546 --> 00:19:04,465
So now there are other people with
powers you're not interested in me?

272
00:19:04,466 --> 00:19:07,105
There's a guy downstairs
who can rewind time.

273
00:19:07,106 --> 00:19:11,105
You can do stuff with milk.

274
00:19:13,386 --> 00:19:17,385
I'll show you what I can do.

275
00:19:23,546 --> 00:19:25,625
What are you doing?
What is that?

276
00:19:25,626 --> 00:19:28,865
That's the Greek yoghurt
you ate earlier.

277
00:19:28,866 --> 00:19:32,865
It's moving up into your trachea.

278
00:19:43,986 --> 00:19:47,985
You think I'm a nobody.

279
00:19:52,786 --> 00:19:56,785
You're nothing.

280
00:20:21,786 --> 00:20:25,225
Oh Jesus, no!

281
00:20:25,226 --> 00:20:28,145
There's puss seeping out of my cock.

282
00:20:28,146 --> 00:20:29,385
Ugh!

283
00:20:29,386 --> 00:20:32,745
One of those three girls, or the girl
I shagged in the toilets at the club,

284
00:20:32,746 --> 00:20:34,945
one of them had
poor personal hygiene.

285
00:20:34,946 --> 00:20:37,825
This is a catastrophe of
tsunami-like proportions.

286
00:20:37,826 --> 00:20:41,825
No girl in her right mind is
going to have sex with that.

287
00:20:42,026 --> 00:20:44,985
You should ask that
Daisy girl to cure you.

288
00:20:44,986 --> 00:20:46,785
Right.

289
00:20:46,786 --> 00:20:50,425
She wants to cure the world,
she can start with my cock.

290
00:20:50,426 --> 00:20:54,105
'We'd just found that other boy's
body stuffed in the locker and then

291
00:20:54,106 --> 00:20:56,345
'Curtis grabbed my hand
and he's all like,

292
00:20:56,346 --> 00:20:58,305
' "Oh, I wanna bone you,
I wanna shag you senseless." '

293
00:20:58,306 --> 00:21:00,225
'This was just the beginning.

294
00:21:00,226 --> 00:21:02,105
'The five young offenders
soon found that

295
00:21:02,106 --> 00:21:04,105
'each of them had been
affected by the storm.

296
00:21:04,106 --> 00:21:05,905
'Afraid they would be
outcast from society,

297
00:21:05,906 --> 00:21:06,945
'they swore a pact of secrecy...'

298
00:21:06,946 --> 00:21:10,945
'they swore a pact of secrecy...'

299
00:21:11,226 --> 00:21:13,145
Oh, for...

300
00:21:13,146 --> 00:21:14,985
Hi.

301
00:21:14,986 --> 00:21:16,545
Hi. Come in.

302
00:21:16,546 --> 00:21:20,345
Right.

303
00:21:20,346 --> 00:21:22,425
It's Nathan, right?

304
00:21:22,426 --> 00:21:26,425
Right. I just wanted to swing by and
say hi, as one superhero to another.

305
00:21:27,586 --> 00:21:30,265
That's really sweet of you.

306
00:21:30,266 --> 00:21:33,385
So, how mad is all this?

307
00:21:33,386 --> 00:21:37,385
Totally mad. And look at you,
with your wonderful, amazing power.

308
00:21:38,226 --> 00:21:40,105
I saw what you did with
the guy in the wheelchair.

309
00:21:40,106 --> 00:21:44,105
That's like curing two
normal people. Double points.

310
00:21:50,426 --> 00:21:54,425
And so...I was wondering...
if you could maybe help me out

311
00:21:54,786 --> 00:21:57,225
with a small, personal
affliction of my own.

312
00:21:57,226 --> 00:21:58,905
Of course.

313
00:21:58,906 --> 00:22:00,625
What is it?

314
00:22:00,626 --> 00:22:02,145
Well...

315
00:22:02,146 --> 00:22:04,745
I appear to have contracted
a sexually transmitted

316
00:22:04,746 --> 00:22:07,625
disease of some kind.
I honestly don't know how I got it.

317
00:22:07,626 --> 00:22:10,705
I'm sorry. I don't do
sexually transmitted diseases.

318
00:22:10,706 --> 00:22:12,145
No?

319
00:22:12,146 --> 00:22:14,345
Because of the rubbing.

320
00:22:14,346 --> 00:22:17,185
Go to the doctors. They'll
give you some antibiotics.

321
00:22:17,186 --> 00:22:19,025
And how long will that take to work?

322
00:22:19,026 --> 00:22:22,625
Out there, there are loads of
drunken girls, staggering around,

323
00:22:22,626 --> 00:22:26,145
waiting to be shagged. Do you
really want to disappoint them?

324
00:22:26,146 --> 00:22:29,905
I'm sorry. I'm just not
prepared to spend my life

325
00:22:29,906 --> 00:22:31,545
rubbing other people's genitalia.

326
00:22:31,546 --> 00:22:33,625
C'mon. Just give it a quick rub.

327
00:22:33,626 --> 00:22:36,025
It's lovely and clean.
It's pine forest fresh.

328
00:22:36,026 --> 00:22:38,265
I'm not going to rub your cock.

329
00:22:38,266 --> 00:22:42,225
Where's your humanity?

330
00:22:42,226 --> 00:22:43,985
It's not going happen.

331
00:22:43,986 --> 00:22:46,705
OK?

332
00:22:46,706 --> 00:22:50,385
No. That's fair enough.

333
00:22:50,386 --> 00:22:52,025
I suppose have only myself

334
00:22:52,026 --> 00:22:56,025
and the dirty bitch
I had sex with to blame.

335
00:23:00,506 --> 00:23:02,465
What's that?

336
00:23:02,466 --> 00:23:06,465
That's my Mother Theresa, Young
Humanitarian of the Year Award.

337
00:23:08,226 --> 00:23:11,425
It's for the charity
work I did in India.

338
00:23:11,426 --> 00:23:15,185
Good for you,
and good for Mamma Theresa.

339
00:23:15,186 --> 00:23:17,225
God rest her beautiful soul.

340
00:23:17,226 --> 00:23:20,105
Myself next year myself.

341
00:23:20,106 --> 00:23:21,225
Gotcha!

342
00:23:21,226 --> 00:23:22,505
Urgh!

343
00:23:22,506 --> 00:23:24,385
Get off!

344
00:23:25,226 --> 00:23:28,185
Oh!

345
00:23:30,346 --> 00:23:33,865
Fuck, what have I done?

346
00:23:33,866 --> 00:23:35,385
Hey...look...just...

347
00:23:35,386 --> 00:23:37,545
heal yourself! All right?

348
00:23:37,546 --> 00:23:39,065
Heal yourself. That's it.

349
00:23:39,066 --> 00:23:43,065
Rub it better, now, rub it better.

350
00:23:45,706 --> 00:23:47,345
What did you do?

351
00:23:47,346 --> 00:23:49,385
It was an accident.

352
00:23:49,386 --> 00:23:51,145
She was rubbing my cock.

353
00:23:51,146 --> 00:23:55,105
She started foaming at the mouth,
she tripped, and impaled herself

354
00:23:55,106 --> 00:23:59,105
on her Mother Theresa, Young
Humanitarian of the Year Award.

355
00:23:59,306 --> 00:24:01,545
I know it sounds unlikely...

356
00:24:01,546 --> 00:24:05,545
But there it is.

357
00:24:08,371 --> 00:24:11,770
The police are going to
want to interview you again,

358
00:24:11,771 --> 00:24:15,770
but they seem to be satisfied
that Daisy's death was an accident.

359
00:24:15,891 --> 00:24:20,930
Oh! Thank you!

360
00:24:22,451 --> 00:24:24,170
I just want to say...

361
00:24:24,171 --> 00:24:25,810
it's a tragedy.

362
00:24:25,811 --> 00:24:29,810
And no-one is more upset
about this than me.

363
00:24:30,011 --> 00:24:31,890
But what's done, is done.

364
00:24:31,891 --> 00:24:35,890
I think we should all move on, huh?
Stronger, fitter, wiser.

365
00:24:37,371 --> 00:24:39,410
This could only happen to you.

366
00:24:39,411 --> 00:24:41,570
She was going to cure the world.

367
00:24:41,571 --> 00:24:44,050
There's only so many times
I can say I'm sorry!

368
00:24:44,051 --> 00:24:48,050
And if you're so cut up about it,
why don't you...

369
00:24:48,451 --> 00:24:51,530
..And fix this entire situation?
You know it doesn't work like that!

370
00:24:51,531 --> 00:24:55,490
- I'm getting pretty sick
of hearing that! - Prick!

371
00:24:55,491 --> 00:24:59,490
You fuck up like this again,
and I will finish you.

372
00:25:00,691 --> 00:25:04,690
I'll try not to.

373
00:25:20,811 --> 00:25:24,010
I'll tell you something, though.

374
00:25:24,011 --> 00:25:25,650
It's all cleared up.

375
00:25:25,651 --> 00:25:27,570
You know... Down there.

376
00:25:27,571 --> 00:25:30,650
As clean as a new pin.

377
00:25:34,931 --> 00:25:38,930
If you're still in hiding, you should
probably do your invisible thing.

378
00:25:44,211 --> 00:25:48,210
Oh, hey!

379
00:25:52,851 --> 00:25:54,290
You're alone?

380
00:25:54,291 --> 00:25:58,290
Uh-huh. So are you all right then?

381
00:26:00,531 --> 00:26:04,530
I thought I'd feel
like we'd made it.

382
00:26:05,051 --> 00:26:08,890
You know, all this fame stuff.
It just...

383
00:26:08,891 --> 00:26:11,250
feels a bit... pointless.

384
00:26:11,251 --> 00:26:12,410
Of course it's pointless.

385
00:26:12,411 --> 00:26:16,410
That's why famous people pretend
to care about the Africans.

386
00:26:16,971 --> 00:26:20,210
- He knew it would be like this.
- Who?

387
00:26:20,211 --> 00:26:22,090
Simon.

388
00:26:22,091 --> 00:26:25,650
We should've listened to him.

389
00:26:25,651 --> 00:26:27,690
Do you know where he is?

390
00:26:27,691 --> 00:26:31,690
No. No, I haven't seen him.

391
00:26:32,531 --> 00:26:36,130
Nuts?

392
00:26:36,131 --> 00:26:39,930
He said picking up litter
was the best time of his life.

393
00:26:39,931 --> 00:26:43,930
I think that demonstrates
his rather low expectations.

394
00:26:45,691 --> 00:26:49,690
If you see him,
tell him he was right.

395
00:26:51,451 --> 00:26:55,450
Cheerio.

396
00:27:00,611 --> 00:27:04,490
What's up with you?

397
00:27:04,491 --> 00:27:08,490
I never said that,
about picking up litter.

398
00:28:45,451 --> 00:28:49,450
When was that taken?

399
00:28:53,371 --> 00:28:55,090
Where did you get that?

400
00:28:55,091 --> 00:28:57,450
Someone gave it to me.

401
00:28:57,451 --> 00:29:01,450
Who?

402
00:29:04,531 --> 00:29:06,610
What is this place?

403
00:29:06,611 --> 00:29:09,490
The guy in the mask...

404
00:29:09,491 --> 00:29:13,490
He lived here.

405
00:29:25,451 --> 00:29:29,450
Who is he?

406
00:29:31,251 --> 00:29:35,250
It's you.

407
00:30:03,451 --> 00:30:07,450
You came back, so that we could
be together in the future.

408
00:30:11,531 --> 00:30:13,610
You...

409
00:30:13,611 --> 00:30:14,850
And me...

410
00:30:14,851 --> 00:30:16,490
We're together?

411
00:30:16,491 --> 00:30:20,490
Yeah, we were,
and we will be again...

412
00:30:21,971 --> 00:30:25,970
I hope we will be.

413
00:30:27,691 --> 00:30:31,130
You think you're surprised?
Imagine being me!

414
00:30:31,131 --> 00:30:35,130
You're still you,
but you're different.

415
00:30:35,731 --> 00:30:39,290
You're more confident, and...

416
00:30:39,291 --> 00:30:42,730
My power doesn't work on you.

417
00:30:42,731 --> 00:30:46,730
You can touch me.

418
00:30:50,811 --> 00:30:52,330
And then I die?

419
00:30:52,331 --> 00:30:55,290
You saved my life.

420
00:30:55,291 --> 00:30:59,250
You said
if you didn't come back and die,

421
00:30:59,251 --> 00:31:01,810
you wouldn't become
the person you needed to be.

422
00:31:01,811 --> 00:31:05,690
It's like in Terminator, when John
Connor sends Kyle Reece back in time

423
00:31:05,691 --> 00:31:08,770
so that he can be his father.

424
00:31:08,771 --> 00:31:12,770
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

425
00:31:15,571 --> 00:31:18,770
You protected us.

426
00:31:18,771 --> 00:31:22,770
You're like a proper superhero.

427
00:31:25,331 --> 00:31:29,330
When do I turn into this superhero?

428
00:31:33,891 --> 00:31:37,330
So what happens now?

429
00:31:37,331 --> 00:31:41,330
I have no fucking idea.

430
00:31:52,611 --> 00:31:56,610
I don't understand.

431
00:31:57,131 --> 00:31:59,930
Since this whole thing
with the storm went public,

432
00:31:59,931 --> 00:32:02,410
I've been taking
on new clients all the time.

433
00:32:02,411 --> 00:32:05,770
The truth is, I don't have time
to represent you any more.

434
00:32:05,771 --> 00:32:08,810
I'm sorry.

435
00:32:08,811 --> 00:32:12,810
# DELIBES: The Flower Duet

436
00:32:20,091 --> 00:32:24,090
What are you doing?

437
00:32:31,571 --> 00:32:33,570
That's the cheese you had earlier,

438
00:32:33,571 --> 00:32:37,570
slowly clogging your arteries...

439
00:33:02,651 --> 00:33:06,650
OK, stand by for rehearsals, please.

440
00:33:25,971 --> 00:33:28,690
If blowing my brains out
live on national television

441
00:33:28,691 --> 00:33:30,330
doesn't get the ladies juiced,

442
00:33:30,331 --> 00:33:33,810
nothing will.

443
00:33:33,811 --> 00:33:35,770
How do I look?

444
00:33:35,771 --> 00:33:37,410
Like a prick in a suit.

445
00:33:37,411 --> 00:33:40,450
That's sexual jealousy,
because of my prowess as a lover.

446
00:33:40,451 --> 00:33:42,810
Is it true
you shit yourself when you die?

447
00:33:42,811 --> 00:33:44,370
That only happened the once.

448
00:33:44,371 --> 00:33:47,370
And I've got a bucket standing by,
just in case.

449
00:33:47,371 --> 00:33:49,610
Do you want that?
Just lost my appetite...

450
00:33:49,611 --> 00:33:52,330
No, I'm lactose intolerant.

451
00:33:52,331 --> 00:33:54,010
Does that mean you're afraid of cows?

452
00:33:54,011 --> 00:33:56,490
No. It means I don't eat
cheese or dairy products.

453
00:33:56,491 --> 00:34:00,490
Oh. I never knew that about you.

454
00:34:00,971 --> 00:34:03,290
Are you all right?

455
00:34:03,291 --> 00:34:04,890
Yeah.

456
00:34:04,891 --> 00:34:06,850
We'll talk later, yeah?

457
00:34:06,851 --> 00:34:10,290
Have I got time to go to the toilet
before you shoot yourself?

458
00:34:10,291 --> 00:34:14,130
A piss, yes. A shit, probably not.

459
00:34:14,131 --> 00:34:18,130
I'll come with you.

460
00:34:34,411 --> 00:34:36,490
Oh, gross!

461
00:34:36,491 --> 00:34:37,970
What's that?

462
00:34:37,971 --> 00:34:41,970
There's something dripping
from the ceiling. I dunno what...

463
00:34:42,251 --> 00:34:46,250
Kelly?

464
00:34:49,051 --> 00:34:50,090
Kelly?

465
00:34:50,091 --> 00:34:52,810
Quit dicking around.

466
00:35:13,731 --> 00:35:17,130
Ah! Christ!

467
00:35:17,131 --> 00:35:18,170
Sorry, man!

468
00:35:18,171 --> 00:35:22,170
What fucking prick did that?

469
00:35:22,651 --> 00:35:25,290
This guy really is
the most unbelievable tool.

470
00:35:25,291 --> 00:35:26,490
I told you.

471
00:35:28,451 --> 00:35:29,490
Roll titles.

472
00:35:29,491 --> 00:35:33,490
Live in 20.

473
00:35:47,131 --> 00:35:51,130
Going live in five, four, three...

474
00:35:55,571 --> 00:35:57,810
And now, for your viewing pleasure,

475
00:35:57,811 --> 00:36:01,810
I will blow my brains out,
live on national television.

476
00:36:04,731 --> 00:36:08,730
Enjoy.

477
00:36:14,891 --> 00:36:17,890
Alisha?

478
00:36:17,891 --> 00:36:21,890
Kelly?

479
00:36:30,331 --> 00:36:34,330
What is that?

480
00:36:38,171 --> 00:36:40,330
It's milk.

481
00:36:40,331 --> 00:36:42,490
That milk guy?

482
00:36:42,491 --> 00:36:46,490
We need to get to the hotel.

483
00:36:48,571 --> 00:36:50,490
Oh, shit.

484
00:36:50,491 --> 00:36:54,490
No!

485
00:37:24,571 --> 00:37:28,130
And that, boys and girls, is how
you shoot yourself in the head.

486
00:37:28,131 --> 00:37:30,330
I wouldn't recommend
trying it at home.

487
00:37:45,211 --> 00:37:49,050
I'm not being funny, but you might
want to fuck off out of here.

488
00:37:49,051 --> 00:37:52,130
I'm expecting some seriously horny,
barely legal groupies

489
00:37:52,131 --> 00:37:53,690
knocking on that door any second.

490
00:37:53,691 --> 00:37:55,650
They're walking into a trap.

491
00:37:55,651 --> 00:37:57,130
What's that?

492
00:37:57,131 --> 00:37:58,610
The milk guy.

493
00:37:58,611 --> 00:38:00,610
He's got Alisha.

494
00:38:00,611 --> 00:38:03,130
What? When did this happen?

495
00:38:03,131 --> 00:38:06,930
He killed me, Nathan.

496
00:38:06,931 --> 00:38:10,930
I'm fucking dead.

497
00:38:24,871 --> 00:38:27,110
Curtis, wait!

498
00:38:27,111 --> 00:38:31,110
Alisha? Nikki?

499
00:38:33,391 --> 00:38:37,390
Curtis?

500
00:38:46,551 --> 00:38:50,550
You nipple-sucking, breast-feeding
momma's boy! You killed her!

501
00:38:57,191 --> 00:39:01,190
Does that feel strange?

502
00:39:09,351 --> 00:39:13,270
You can't...kill me.

503
00:39:13,271 --> 00:39:17,270
I'm...immortal...

504
00:39:19,311 --> 00:39:22,750
I'm not trying to kill you.

505
00:39:22,751 --> 00:39:26,750
That's the mozzarella wrapping
itself around your central cortex.

506
00:39:29,751 --> 00:39:33,750
You're going to spend the rest
of your life as a vegetable.

507
00:40:08,311 --> 00:40:12,310
Nathan?

508
00:42:41,751 --> 00:42:45,750
Why did you do it?

509
00:42:47,711 --> 00:42:51,710
Because the only time people like me
really get noticed

510
00:42:51,711 --> 00:42:54,350
is when we kill
a shitload of people.

511
00:42:54,351 --> 00:42:57,190
They'll talk about this for years.

512
00:42:57,191 --> 00:43:00,310
They'll talk about me.

513
00:43:00,311 --> 00:43:04,190
Monsieur grand fromage!

514
00:43:04,191 --> 00:43:07,950
That cheese shit won't
work on me, dickhead.

515
00:43:07,951 --> 00:43:09,990
I'm lactose intolerant.

516
00:43:09,991 --> 00:43:13,990
Then maybe I'll just
have to stab you instead.

517
00:43:35,231 --> 00:43:37,070
They're all dead.

518
00:43:37,071 --> 00:43:39,150
You have to save them.

519
00:43:39,151 --> 00:43:43,150
We have to go back to before we were
famous. We have to stop him. Do it!

520
00:44:04,791 --> 00:44:07,110
What are you looking at?

521
00:44:07,111 --> 00:44:11,110
Nothing.

522
00:44:16,991 --> 00:44:20,990
What?

523
00:44:21,151 --> 00:44:25,150
There's something we need to do.

524
00:44:58,551 --> 00:45:00,310
That's it, then.

525
00:45:00,311 --> 00:45:02,790
It's over.

526
00:45:02,791 --> 00:45:05,510
No more community service.

527
00:45:05,511 --> 00:45:08,110
I thought we'd be, like,
all celebrating and shit.

528
00:45:08,111 --> 00:45:12,110
It doesn't really feel
like there's much to celebrate.

529
00:45:12,951 --> 00:45:15,470
I just want you to know...

530
00:45:15,471 --> 00:45:19,470
being here with all of you, it's
been the best time of my life.

531
00:45:22,871 --> 00:45:26,870
I had a week in Spain last year.
That was way better.

532
00:45:27,071 --> 00:45:30,830
What is up with all of you?
All the shit we've been through.

533
00:45:30,831 --> 00:45:34,830
We're all here. We're all alive.

534
00:45:35,071 --> 00:45:36,110
We made it.

535
00:45:36,111 --> 00:45:40,110
Great(!) And I have no job,
no money, no girlfriend,

536
00:45:41,111 --> 00:45:45,110
nowhere to live, no useful skills or
qualifications. OK, so I'm immortal.

537
00:45:46,831 --> 00:45:49,750
But other than that, I've
basically got fuck all going for me.

538
00:45:49,751 --> 00:45:53,750
What are we going to do tomorrow?
Or the day after that?

539
00:45:53,911 --> 00:45:55,950
Huh? We have just been shat out

540
00:45:55,951 --> 00:45:59,950
onto a huge pool of piss with all
the other long-term unemployable.

541
00:46:06,151 --> 00:46:09,910
Does anyone fancy a drink?

542
00:46:09,911 --> 00:46:12,550
Yeah, sure, man.

543
00:46:12,551 --> 00:46:15,830
Y'know, apart from all the killing
and the dying and stuff,

544
00:46:15,831 --> 00:46:19,830
this community service really wasn't as
bad as I thought it was going to be.

545
00:46:31,351 --> 00:46:35,350
# I don't know what's happened
to the kids today

546
00:46:35,831 --> 00:46:39,670
# I don't know what's happened
to the kids today

547
00:46:39,671 --> 00:46:43,670
# I don't know
what's happened to the kids today

548
00:46:44,231 --> 00:46:48,230
# I don't know what's happened
to the kids today

549
00:46:48,391 --> 00:46:52,390
# I don't know
what's happened to the kids today

550
00:46:52,471 --> 00:46:56,470
# I don't know what's happened
to the kids today. #

551
00:47:10,231 --> 00:47:12,550
I can give you your life back.

552
00:47:12,551 --> 00:47:14,310
There was this guy took my power.

553
00:47:14,311 --> 00:47:16,550
You sold your powers?

554
00:47:16,551 --> 00:47:17,510
Yeah, mate.

555
00:47:17,511 --> 00:47:21,470
That's how babies get turned into dwarves.
I like dwarves. Me too.

556
00:47:21,471 --> 00:47:23,430
My waters have broken!
The baby's coming!

557
00:47:23,431 --> 00:47:27,430
I'm Jesus Christ,
and I have been reborn.

558
00:47:28,191 --> 00:47:29,190
Where are you going?

559
00:47:29,191 --> 00:47:33,190
I'm going to kill Jesus.

560
00:48:04,631 --> 00:48:08,630
