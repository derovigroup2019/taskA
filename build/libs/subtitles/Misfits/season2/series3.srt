What did you see
when you went forward?

2
00:00:02,680 --> 00:00:04,839
I was on the roof
dressed as a superhero.

3
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:05,359
Yeah, then what happened?

4
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:07,159
Nothing.

5
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:08,159
Who is this guy?

6
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:09,719
I don't know.
He's following me.

7
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:11,519
What does he actually know?

8
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:15,519
He seems to know everything.
We need to find him.

9
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:18,559
I'm going to take a shit in his bed.

10
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:19,599
Who are you?

11
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:21,319
Why are you in my flat?

12
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:25,319
It's you!

13
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:50,839
Give me the bag!

14
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:51,719
Ow, my necklace!

15
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:55,719
Give me the bag, bitch!

16
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:17,199
You're touching me?

17
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:22,639
Who are you?

18
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:40,599
# The city breathing

19
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:42,599
# The people churning

20
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:44,079
# The conversating

21
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:48,079
# The price is what?

22
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:02,079
# The conversating

23
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:04,039
# This place is heaven

24
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:08,039
And if you see them... #

25
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:20,999
Right.

26
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,719
Put all this shit in that skip.

27
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:25,999
Would it kill you
to dress it up a bit?

28
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,999
Put all this shit
in that skip, please.

29
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:34,079
Sometimes I wonder if you take
this job entirely seriously.

30
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,999
I'm 100% committed
to yourongoing rehabilitation.

31
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:43,279
It occupies my every waking minute.

32
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:48,599
Er, where are you going?

33
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:52,599
For a coffee and a Danish.

34
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:56,879
Smug bastard.

35
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:01,399
Well, this is a big load of wank!

36
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:06,279
Ah, ha, ha. Nice.

37
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:13,559
So what are you doing later?

38
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:16,399
I'm going to get
mytattoo touched up.

39
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:19,839
Sounds painful! Maybe I should
come along and hold your hand.

40
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:22,919
Yeah, all right.

41
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:26,919
'Those two going together.
How's that ever going to work?'

42
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:41,039
Have you seen any more
of that guy in the mask?

43
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:43,319
Not since last week.

44
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:45,359
Why do you think helead us
to that girl's flat?

45
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:49,359
Maybe he wanted us to know
that he knew that we were on to him.

46
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:53,719
Or there could be another
totally different explanation.

47
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:56,399
You're supposed
toknow about this stuff.

48
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,799
Why are you interested in him?

49
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:01,959
Because I just am, all right.

50
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:05,959
What?

51
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:49,759
I've seen some weird shit
over the last few weeks, but this...

52
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:54,799
This goes against
the very laws of nature.

53
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:57,559
It's very wrong.

54
00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:00,279
It looks like
it'sfading or something.

55
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:03,319
Yeah. It just needs
alittle touching up, no?

56
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:05,399
I can do that foryou now
if you want?

57
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:08,239
Yeah. Nice one.

58
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:12,239
Hey, Simon. You should get one.

59
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:15,039
I have a phobia of needles.

60
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:18,239
Listen, I haven't seen you
around town lately.

61
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,959
Nah, I've got curfew.

62
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:23,439
So, whose cock is this?

63
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:24,719
That's mine.

64
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:27,359
Really? I'm not being funny but,

65
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:30,239
why would you do something like that?

66
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:33,359
It expresses how I felt about
my girlfriend when she left me.

67
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:36,119
You couldn't just get drunk
and sleep with a prostitute?

68
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:40,119
Each one of these
means something to me, my friend.

69
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:44,439
When I ink my skin, I feel it.

70
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:46,119
Hey, man.

71
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:50,119
Whatever gets you off!

72
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:55,679
Listen, when your curfew ends, give
me a call. I'll buy you a drink.

73
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:57,999
Hey, Kelly.

74
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,519
How about this one?

75
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,759
Would you fancy me
even more if I had this,

76
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:05,759
or does it look a bit gay to you?

77
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:06,879
Oh!

78
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:10,639
I mean it would look gay on me, just
because I've got a beautiful face.

79
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:12,639
You get away with it, with your face.

80
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:15,599
I'm not saying you're ugly.

81
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:18,239
You've looked in the mirror.

82
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:22,239
No offence, man.

83
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:32,599
None taken.

84
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:43,159
So, how about you and me
go get a drink?

85
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:44,439
Where do you want to go?

86
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:46,359
Who's asking you? I'm talking to him.

87
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:48,679
Look! This is more of a boy's night.

88
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:50,679
We're talking some quality man time.

89
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:52,999
Beer, football...
Maybe some wrestling.

90
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,319
Why are you being such a dick?

91
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:59,239
Come on, man.
Let's go watch some wrestling.

92
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:03,239
We don't need her.

93
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,999
I thought we were going to abar
to watch some wrestling?

94
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:19,799
Nah, who wants to go to a bar?

95
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:22,679
We've got everything we need,
right here. Come on.

96
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:24,199
Make yourself comfortable.

97
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:28,199
Take off your jacket. Relax.

98
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,799
So, this is really cool, huh?

99
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:46,039
A couple of good looking
young fellas, a few beers.

100
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:50,039
That's good times.

101
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:55,319
Hey, why don't I put some music on?

102
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:06,599
Oh!

103
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:10,719
Oh, yeah.

104
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:14,719
Careless Whisper

105
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:35,959
Wanker!

106
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:40,519
Are you talking to me?

107
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,519
Yeah, that's right.

108
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:46,519
Talking to you,
you ugly, rat-faced fuck.

109
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:48,919
You're going to get a slap.

110
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:51,679
Come on then. Save me, you prick!

111
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:55,679
Where you going? Come here!

112
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:12,319
I just want to talk to you.

113
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,439
Really?

114
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:17,239
I thought you might want to break
into my flat and shit in my bed.

115
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:18,759
That wasn't me.
We got the wrong flat.

116
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:22,599
You tell your little friend,
he owes me a new mattress.

117
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:24,239
He wiped his arse on my pyjamas.

118
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:28,239
That's the kind of thing he does.
He's not right in the head.

119
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:35,839
What?

120
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:39,839
I know this is going
to sound weird and crap but...

121
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,999
I feel like I know you.

122
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:48,319
You feel like you know me!

123
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:53,679
You smooth bastard.

124
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:56,479
Well, you can help yourself.

125
00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:00,399
Just pull my knickers up when
you're done. I'll order a pizza.

126
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:03,239
Are you always such a bitch?

127
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:07,239
Are you always such a weird twat?

128
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:09,639
Are we done?

129
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:13,639
Yeah.

130
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:29,479
I want to know everything
there is to know about you.

131
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:31,399
Like what?

132
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:35,399
Anything.

133
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:40,519
I just bought the Battlestar
Galactica DVD box set.

134
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:44,159
Tell me about your
first sexual experience.

135
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:48,159
Do you want to hear about mine?

136
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:51,599
It was a family camping holiday.

137
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:54,199
One of my mum's friends came with us

138
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:58,119
and one night I felt her hand
sliding into my sleeping bag,

139
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:02,119
like a warm, friendly snake.

140
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:03,639
Sss!

141
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:06,879
Then she grabs my cock
and starts wanking me off.

142
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:09,639
She had lovely little hands.
Like a midget's.

143
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:11,119
Your hand's on my leg?

144
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:15,119
Shh.

145
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:20,999
What are you doing?

146
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,759
You don't know how much
I've always wanted to do that.

147
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:26,159
Feel my heart. It's racing.

148
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:28,319
It's OK, it's OK. I'll be gentle.

149
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,799
Why don't we slip your trousers off?

150
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:33,159
It's OK, we don't
have to fight any longer.

151
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:35,799
I want to see it.

152
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:39,319
Simon. Simon, don't go.
We don't have to go all the way.

153
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:41,239
We can just cuddle.

154
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:44,279
And when you're ready,
we can do some dry humping.

155
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:48,279
Call me!

156
00:14:01,233 --> 00:14:04,712
How's your head?

157
00:14:04,713 --> 00:14:07,072
What the fuck is going on?

158
00:14:07,073 --> 00:14:09,912
Since when did you run around,
jumping off buildings?

159
00:14:09,913 --> 00:14:12,352
Ever since I travelled
back from the future.

160
00:14:12,353 --> 00:14:14,552
Really, did you?

161
00:14:14,553 --> 00:14:18,552
Yes.

162
00:14:19,593 --> 00:14:23,592
Seriously?

163
00:14:26,713 --> 00:14:28,112
How does this work?

164
00:14:28,113 --> 00:14:29,512
There's two of you.

165
00:14:29,513 --> 00:14:31,152
There's the Simon you know,

166
00:14:31,153 --> 00:14:35,072
and there's the future Simon.

167
00:14:35,073 --> 00:14:37,752
Me.

168
00:14:37,753 --> 00:14:41,752
You're so different.

169
00:14:43,433 --> 00:14:46,912
A lot happens between now and then.

170
00:14:46,913 --> 00:14:48,712
You touched me.

171
00:14:48,713 --> 00:14:52,712
Why doesn't my power work on you?

172
00:14:55,033 --> 00:14:58,432
Things are different in the future.

173
00:14:58,433 --> 00:15:02,432
What's with all the photographs
and clocks and...

174
00:15:05,233 --> 00:15:09,232
There are things that need
to happen at certain times.

175
00:15:09,673 --> 00:15:13,672
I'm here to make sure they do.

176
00:15:20,913 --> 00:15:24,912
Does it hurt?

177
00:15:29,473 --> 00:15:33,472
I should go.

178
00:15:41,433 --> 00:15:44,032
No matter what happens...

179
00:15:44,033 --> 00:15:48,032
you can never tell Simon I'm him.

180
00:15:48,393 --> 00:15:49,872
You can't tell any of them.

181
00:15:49,873 --> 00:15:51,512
Not Curtis, not anyone.

182
00:15:51,513 --> 00:15:55,272
It could change anything everything.

183
00:15:55,273 --> 00:15:59,272
Promise me you won't tell.

184
00:16:11,473 --> 00:16:12,552
He kissed me.

185
00:16:12,553 --> 00:16:14,352
Nathan kissed you?

186
00:16:14,353 --> 00:16:18,272
He put his tongue...in my mouth.

187
00:16:18,273 --> 00:16:20,232
He's a dickhead.
He's winding you up.

188
00:16:20,233 --> 00:16:22,872
He tried to take my trousers off.

189
00:16:22,873 --> 00:16:25,592
Are you taking the piss?

190
00:16:25,593 --> 00:16:28,592
He said he wanted to do some...

191
00:16:28,593 --> 00:16:29,912
..dry humping.

192
00:16:29,913 --> 00:16:31,152
What did you do?

193
00:16:31,153 --> 00:16:33,552
I left!

194
00:16:33,553 --> 00:16:37,552
Very quickly.

195
00:16:37,913 --> 00:16:41,232
If you open your heart,

196
00:16:41,233 --> 00:16:45,232
I know we could have something
really beautiful.

197
00:16:45,513 --> 00:16:48,072
Yours...

198
00:16:48,073 --> 00:16:49,752
..forever,

199
00:16:49,753 --> 00:16:52,232
Nathan.

200
00:16:52,233 --> 00:16:54,032
Jesus! Stop kicking me!

201
00:16:54,033 --> 00:16:56,352
What have I told you about
dicking around with Simon?

202
00:16:56,353 --> 00:16:58,472
Who's dicking around?
You put your tongue in his mouth!

203
00:16:58,473 --> 00:16:59,712
Ow! Jesus! All right.

204
00:16:59,713 --> 00:17:03,192
All right, so I got
a littlebit fresh with him.

205
00:17:03,193 --> 00:17:05,632
I was staring into
those big,beautiful eyes.

206
00:17:05,633 --> 00:17:06,712
He's like a...

207
00:17:06,713 --> 00:17:08,152
He's like a handsome shark.

208
00:17:08,153 --> 00:17:10,672
I couldn't help myself.

209
00:17:10,673 --> 00:17:11,872
I love him.

210
00:17:11,873 --> 00:17:12,712
You're a dick!

211
00:17:12,713 --> 00:17:15,112
Do my feelings for him
offend you? I'm sorry.

212
00:17:15,113 --> 00:17:18,272
Because they're true.
And pure... Well, they're true.

213
00:17:18,273 --> 00:17:21,392
I can't pretend any longer. I won't.

214
00:17:21,393 --> 00:17:25,272
'I never felt like this about anyone.
He completes me.'

215
00:17:25,273 --> 00:17:27,512
Er, that's from Jerry Maguire.

216
00:17:27,513 --> 00:17:28,872
Yeah, I know.

217
00:17:28,873 --> 00:17:30,912
I've watched it
fourtimes last night.

218
00:17:30,913 --> 00:17:34,152
It's like he's Tom and I'm Renee.

219
00:17:34,153 --> 00:17:36,272
Someone else
is the ugly,speccy kid.

220
00:17:36,273 --> 00:17:39,152
Are you trying to tell me
you're gay or something?

221
00:17:39,153 --> 00:17:42,072
Gay, straight, retarded. Why
do we put labels and everything?

222
00:17:42,073 --> 00:17:46,072
We do, all right? Or else no-one
will know what the fuck's going on.

223
00:17:47,713 --> 00:17:51,712
Is this why me and you
haven't got it together?

224
00:17:51,833 --> 00:17:54,352
Maybe he's what has been
missing from my life.

225
00:17:54,353 --> 00:17:56,352
Why do you think
I was alwaysso mean to him?

226
00:17:56,353 --> 00:17:57,872
Because you're a wanker.

227
00:17:57,873 --> 00:18:01,872
No, it is because it's much easier
to humiliate, degrade

228
00:18:01,953 --> 00:18:04,192
and just generally
shit allover someone

229
00:18:04,193 --> 00:18:08,192
than it is to admit
thatyou love them!

230
00:18:08,633 --> 00:18:12,632
# You won't believe what love can do

231
00:18:13,793 --> 00:18:17,792
# Until it happens to you. #

232
00:18:23,633 --> 00:18:25,032
Hi.

233
00:18:25,033 --> 00:18:28,472
I got you a drink.

234
00:18:28,473 --> 00:18:32,472
It's just a drink.

235
00:18:40,993 --> 00:18:44,992
Thank you.

236
00:18:45,153 --> 00:18:49,152
Do you ever think about the future?

237
00:18:50,273 --> 00:18:54,192
Do you think about...
what's goingto happen to us?

238
00:18:54,193 --> 00:18:58,032
All the time.

239
00:18:58,033 --> 00:19:00,752
And we need to be ready.

240
00:19:00,753 --> 00:19:03,112
What for?

241
00:19:03,113 --> 00:19:07,112
One day someone's going
to find out about us.

242
00:19:07,833 --> 00:19:11,832
Everything will change.

243
00:19:13,473 --> 00:19:16,952
I know you've looked out for us.
Killing the probation worker.

244
00:19:16,953 --> 00:19:20,952
The second one.

245
00:19:21,913 --> 00:19:24,872
I've never thanked you.

246
00:19:24,873 --> 00:19:28,312
I wanted you to know.

247
00:19:28,313 --> 00:19:32,312
Thanks.

248
00:19:33,993 --> 00:19:37,632
Why are you being so nice to me?

249
00:19:37,633 --> 00:19:41,112
I can be nice.

250
00:19:41,113 --> 00:19:45,112
Sometimes.

251
00:19:48,593 --> 00:19:52,592
Look, if I've ever been
a bitchto you...

252
00:19:54,153 --> 00:19:58,152
I'm sorry.

253
00:19:58,593 --> 00:20:02,592
I've never thought
you werea bitch.

254
00:20:04,313 --> 00:20:08,312
Sometimes I think it's difficult
for beautiful girls.

255
00:20:09,593 --> 00:20:13,592
People don't see past their looks.

256
00:20:21,953 --> 00:20:25,952
I should go.

257
00:20:46,473 --> 00:20:49,272
What's this?

258
00:20:49,273 --> 00:20:50,992
Read it.

259
00:20:50,993 --> 00:20:53,032
We'll take things slowly.

260
00:20:53,033 --> 00:20:56,712
When you're ready to develop the
physical side of our relationship,

261
00:20:56,713 --> 00:21:00,392
you just let me know. No pressure.

262
00:21:00,393 --> 00:21:01,432
Thanks.

263
00:21:01,433 --> 00:21:05,432
It's just so hard when
you'reso cute, and I'm so horny,

264
00:21:05,513 --> 00:21:08,352
and there's only
a couple of thinlayers of cotton

265
00:21:08,353 --> 00:21:12,352
separatingour genitals.

266
00:21:19,153 --> 00:21:23,152
Did you know that he had a tattoo
done with your name on it?

267
00:21:24,553 --> 00:21:28,552
No.

268
00:21:49,153 --> 00:21:50,192
Hey.

269
00:21:50,193 --> 00:21:51,552
Hiya.

270
00:21:51,553 --> 00:21:52,992
Everything all right
with the tattoo?

271
00:21:52,993 --> 00:21:54,032
It's fine.

272
00:21:54,033 --> 00:21:56,232
Know that guy I was with yesterday?
The gobby one?

273
00:21:56,233 --> 00:21:58,272
Is there something wrong with him?

274
00:21:58,273 --> 00:22:01,312
I think there probably is.

275
00:22:01,313 --> 00:22:02,472
Did you tattoo him?

276
00:22:02,473 --> 00:22:04,352
No.

277
00:22:04,353 --> 00:22:05,472
Why?

278
00:22:05,473 --> 00:22:09,072
Because he's got this tattoo
and I thought he might have come in.

279
00:22:09,073 --> 00:22:11,672
'She knows I did it.'

280
00:22:11,673 --> 00:22:13,472
You tattooed him, didn't you?

281
00:22:13,473 --> 00:22:17,472
Did you turn him into a gay?

282
00:22:18,633 --> 00:22:20,392
I always liked you.

283
00:22:20,393 --> 00:22:21,432
What?

284
00:22:21,433 --> 00:22:25,032
Why do you want to be with
a gobby little shit like him? Hm?

285
00:22:25,033 --> 00:22:26,552
Now, I can make you happy.

286
00:22:26,553 --> 00:22:27,672
You're just being weird.

287
00:22:27,673 --> 00:22:31,672
You can't make people gay
just because they're dickheads.

288
00:22:32,633 --> 00:22:33,672
What are you doing?

289
00:22:33,673 --> 00:22:35,992
I'm going to make you so...

290
00:22:35,993 --> 00:22:39,992
happy.

291
00:23:14,825 --> 00:23:18,424
Hi.

292
00:23:18,425 --> 00:23:22,424
Were you sniffing my knickers?

293
00:23:23,425 --> 00:23:25,384
You think I risked my life
travelling through the dimensions

294
00:23:25,385 --> 00:23:28,224
of time so I could sniff
your knickers?

295
00:23:28,225 --> 00:23:29,824
I don't know, did you?

296
00:23:29,825 --> 00:23:33,824
No.

297
00:23:36,705 --> 00:23:40,704
I've got something
that belongs to you.

298
00:23:43,385 --> 00:23:47,384
I thought I'd lost it.

299
00:23:55,185 --> 00:23:57,424
You told me I was beautiful today.

300
00:23:57,425 --> 00:23:59,144
I know.

301
00:23:59,145 --> 00:24:01,584
Everything that happens to Simon,

302
00:24:01,585 --> 00:24:04,424
it's already happened to me.

303
00:24:04,425 --> 00:24:07,384
You made me feel...

304
00:24:07,385 --> 00:24:09,744
Ever since I got this power,

305
00:24:09,745 --> 00:24:12,824
blokes, you know...

306
00:24:12,825 --> 00:24:15,424
It doesn't make you feel
very good about yourself.

307
00:24:15,425 --> 00:24:18,664
It's not down to you.

308
00:24:18,665 --> 00:24:20,824
None of us asked for this.

309
00:24:20,825 --> 00:24:23,104
What d'you want from me?

310
00:24:23,105 --> 00:24:27,104
Why are you here in this time?

311
00:24:27,705 --> 00:24:31,664
I came back for you.

312
00:24:31,665 --> 00:24:33,904
Are we together?

313
00:24:33,905 --> 00:24:37,304
We will be.

314
00:24:37,305 --> 00:24:39,664
That's why I'm here.

315
00:24:39,665 --> 00:24:41,104
You and me?

316
00:24:41,105 --> 00:24:44,624
Seriously.

317
00:24:44,625 --> 00:24:48,624
How is that ever gonna happen?

318
00:24:50,905 --> 00:24:54,904
You fall in love with me.

319
00:24:55,505 --> 00:24:58,144
You can't say stuff like that.

320
00:24:58,145 --> 00:24:59,944
You know what happens.

321
00:24:59,945 --> 00:25:03,944
And I don't know how I'm supposed
to feel, and it's freaking me out.

322
00:25:10,105 --> 00:25:14,104
You... You need to go.

323
00:25:14,945 --> 00:25:17,544
Don't.

324
00:25:17,545 --> 00:25:21,544
Will you please fuck off!

325
00:26:08,705 --> 00:26:10,984
Hi.

326
00:26:10,985 --> 00:26:14,984
Come here.

327
00:26:18,105 --> 00:26:18,704
I don't feel like it.

328
00:26:18,705 --> 00:26:21,824
C'mon.
Let's go to the storeroom.

329
00:26:21,825 --> 00:26:24,744
Can we just leave it, yeah?

330
00:26:24,745 --> 00:26:26,224
What's up with you?

331
00:26:26,225 --> 00:26:28,064
Nothing.

332
00:26:28,065 --> 00:26:29,264
No, no, you've been in
some kind of weird mood.

333
00:26:29,265 --> 00:26:30,304
No, I haven't.

334
00:26:30,305 --> 00:26:32,944
Now you don't want to have sex?

335
00:26:32,945 --> 00:26:36,704
We don't have sex.
What's that supposed to mean?

336
00:26:36,705 --> 00:26:37,864
Well? What?

337
00:26:37,865 --> 00:26:41,504
Is this it? Is this the best I get?
Wanking myself off in a storeroom.

338
00:26:41,505 --> 00:26:43,624
It's not my fault I can't touch you.

339
00:26:43,625 --> 00:26:45,584
So it's my fault?

340
00:26:45,585 --> 00:26:46,944
No, I didn't mean that.

341
00:26:46,945 --> 00:26:48,664
You think I've asked for this?
No.

342
00:26:48,665 --> 00:26:51,184
Maybe you're right.
Maybe I deserve all this.

343
00:26:51,185 --> 00:26:54,864
But I need
you to make me feel like I don't.

344
00:26:54,865 --> 00:26:57,824
Alisha, I didn't mean that.

345
00:26:57,825 --> 00:26:59,104
Alisha.

346
00:26:59,105 --> 00:27:01,504
And don't even think about
using your power to fix this.

347
00:27:01,505 --> 00:27:05,504
I want to know what
a prick you can be.

348
00:27:06,425 --> 00:27:08,664
I don't even remember
having that done.

349
00:27:08,665 --> 00:27:12,664
No, neither do I. I don't regret
it though. Not one little bit.

350
00:27:13,745 --> 00:27:16,024
I think the tattoos
are controlling you.

351
00:27:16,025 --> 00:27:17,864
That tattoo guy must have done them.

352
00:27:17,865 --> 00:27:20,544
Er, Vince wouldn't do that.
He loves me.

353
00:27:20,545 --> 00:27:23,664
That's your tattoo talking.
Cute and clever.

354
00:27:23,665 --> 00:27:27,664
And that's yours.

355
00:27:44,545 --> 00:27:48,544
Hi.

356
00:27:50,665 --> 00:27:54,664
Are you coming in?

357
00:27:56,025 --> 00:27:59,504
I don't even know if what
you're telling me is true.

358
00:27:59,505 --> 00:28:03,224
You say all these, things.

359
00:28:03,225 --> 00:28:05,904
You tell me I fall in love with you.

360
00:28:05,905 --> 00:28:08,624
How do I know it happens?

361
00:28:08,625 --> 00:28:12,624
You can't do this to me.

362
00:28:51,945 --> 00:28:54,984
I have to go.

363
00:28:54,985 --> 00:28:58,984
You touch me like that and
then you tell me you have to go?

364
00:28:59,745 --> 00:29:02,824
There's something I need to do.

365
00:29:02,825 --> 00:29:06,824
Wait here.

366
00:29:10,705 --> 00:29:14,624
What am I doing?

367
00:29:14,625 --> 00:29:17,144
It's going to be all right.

368
00:29:17,145 --> 00:29:21,144
I should know. I'm from the future.

369
00:29:32,585 --> 00:29:33,624
We need to get him
to remove the tattoos.

370
00:29:33,625 --> 00:29:34,904
I really don't think he did it.

371
00:29:34,905 --> 00:29:37,424
I need to find Alisha.
We had a big fight.

372
00:29:37,425 --> 00:29:41,424
Hey, man. Love hurts, OK.
It chews you up and spits you out...

373
00:29:41,745 --> 00:29:44,624
like a big ball of mucus.

374
00:29:44,625 --> 00:29:48,624
Oy.

375
00:29:49,065 --> 00:29:50,184
It's him.

376
00:29:50,185 --> 00:29:51,824
We can see that.

377
00:29:51,825 --> 00:29:55,824
What does he want?

378
00:29:56,585 --> 00:29:58,304
Hi.

379
00:29:58,305 --> 00:30:01,344
You all right there, fella?

380
00:30:01,345 --> 00:30:05,344
He's got a gun!

381
00:30:21,465 --> 00:30:23,544
It's peanuts.

382
00:30:23,545 --> 00:30:25,104
Dry-roasted.

383
00:30:25,105 --> 00:30:27,704
All that drama, he drops off a snack?

384
00:30:27,705 --> 00:30:30,944
Why is he giving us peanuts?

385
00:30:30,945 --> 00:30:34,464
Maybe he knows I missed lunch.

386
00:30:34,465 --> 00:30:37,544
I suppose you've got a
better explanation than that?

387
00:30:37,545 --> 00:30:38,584
Anything,

388
00:30:38,585 --> 00:30:40,584
anything you could possibly come
up with would be better than that.

389
00:30:40,585 --> 00:30:43,264
All right, touchy. Just cos you
and your girlfriend split up.

390
00:30:43,265 --> 00:30:45,904
We didn't split up!

391
00:30:45,905 --> 00:30:49,904
All right.

392
00:30:52,505 --> 00:30:54,664
We should go to the tattoo parlour.

393
00:30:54,665 --> 00:30:55,944
Are you coming?

394
00:30:55,945 --> 00:30:59,944
Let's just get this done, all right?

395
00:31:15,985 --> 00:31:19,984
Oh, there he is, Mr Dick.

396
00:31:20,665 --> 00:31:23,504
Because of the tattoo, on your cock?

397
00:31:23,505 --> 00:31:25,184
So what is this?

398
00:31:25,185 --> 00:31:28,344
We know about the tattoos.
I told them that you didn't do it.

399
00:31:28,345 --> 00:31:32,064
Just get rid of the
bullshit tattoos, yeah?

400
00:31:32,065 --> 00:31:33,504
Or what?

401
00:31:33,505 --> 00:31:34,784
Or get ready to feel the pain.

402
00:31:34,785 --> 00:31:35,904
You're not gonna hurt him.

403
00:31:35,905 --> 00:31:38,224
You're on our side.

404
00:31:38,225 --> 00:31:41,944
He's so fit.
Lose the tattoos!

405
00:31:41,945 --> 00:31:45,944
WHIRRING

406
00:31:53,025 --> 00:31:55,664
You stabbed me!

407
00:31:55,665 --> 00:31:58,544
Woah, woah, woah, woah, woah.
She stays. You go.

408
00:31:58,545 --> 00:31:59,624
Don't just stand there.

409
00:31:59,625 --> 00:32:02,864
Right, right, right.

410
00:32:02,865 --> 00:32:06,864
What do we do?

411
00:32:10,425 --> 00:32:14,424
Remove the tattoos,
or I open the nuts.

412
00:32:16,065 --> 00:32:18,664
He stabs me
and you're offering him peanuts?

413
00:32:18,665 --> 00:32:21,824
Nuts are his kryptonite.

414
00:32:21,825 --> 00:32:22,984
Like in Superman.

415
00:32:22,985 --> 00:32:26,984
Listen.
Sure we can work this out, yeah?

416
00:32:27,905 --> 00:32:30,744
Don't open those nuts.

417
00:32:30,745 --> 00:32:32,464
You want some?

418
00:32:32,465 --> 00:32:34,184
Dry roasted.

419
00:32:34,185 --> 00:32:35,824
So butch.

420
00:32:35,825 --> 00:32:39,824
Listen! Drop the nuts
or I'll take her eye out!

421
00:32:42,145 --> 00:32:44,904
You're so sexy.

422
00:32:44,905 --> 00:32:47,624
Let her go!
Put your nuts on the floor!

423
00:32:47,625 --> 00:32:49,544
Don't make me do it!
Drop the nuts!

424
00:32:49,545 --> 00:32:51,904
Drop the gun!
Will someone tell me what's going on!

425
00:32:51,905 --> 00:32:53,824
I will shoot her in the eye!

426
00:32:53,825 --> 00:32:55,664
Let her go!

427
00:32:55,665 --> 00:32:59,664
AAARGHHHHH!

428
00:33:19,065 --> 00:33:22,024
Simon!

429
00:33:22,025 --> 00:33:26,024
Please don't kill him.
My beautiful boy.

430
00:33:27,265 --> 00:33:31,264
I will never...let you go...

431
00:33:49,785 --> 00:33:51,184
Remove...the...tattoos.

432
00:33:51,185 --> 00:33:53,704
Inject me.

433
00:33:53,705 --> 00:33:57,704
Do it!

434
00:34:19,625 --> 00:34:23,624
If you want to spunk all over a
girl's tattoos, just ask them, yeah?

435
00:34:32,643 --> 00:34:35,402
What do you want?

436
00:34:35,403 --> 00:34:39,402
I bought you some pyjamas.

437
00:35:08,803 --> 00:35:11,682
Are you OK?

438
00:35:11,683 --> 00:35:14,642
Brilliant

439
00:35:14,643 --> 00:35:18,642
Peaches and cream

440
00:35:20,883 --> 00:35:23,922
Can I do anything, like?

441
00:35:23,923 --> 00:35:25,602
You got a spare heart?

442
00:35:25,603 --> 00:35:29,602
What?

443
00:35:31,483 --> 00:35:32,922
I just erm...

444
00:35:32,923 --> 00:35:34,762
I just wanted you to have 'em.

445
00:35:34,763 --> 00:35:38,442
You know?

446
00:35:38,443 --> 00:35:42,442
I hope they fit all right.

447
00:35:43,763 --> 00:35:47,762
Thanks.

448
00:35:49,843 --> 00:35:53,042
I have to go, like.

449
00:35:53,043 --> 00:35:56,482
I feel weird leaving you like this.

450
00:35:56,483 --> 00:36:00,482
It's not as bad it looks.

451
00:36:01,723 --> 00:36:05,722
I'll be fine.

452
00:36:13,963 --> 00:36:16,482
This is where it all started.

453
00:36:16,483 --> 00:36:19,682
I'm standing in the exact spot
where three months ago

454
00:36:19,683 --> 00:36:22,482
a freak storm caused The ASBO Five

455
00:36:22,483 --> 00:36:26,002
to develop
their extraordinary powers.

456
00:36:26,003 --> 00:36:29,522
So when did you first realise
you had a power?

457
00:36:29,523 --> 00:36:33,042
'Well, we'd just found that other
boy's body stuffed in the locker

458
00:36:33,043 --> 00:36:35,762
'and then Curtis grabbed my hand
and he's all like,

459
00:36:35,763 --> 00:36:38,322
"Oh, I want to bone you.
I want to shag you senseless."

460
00:36:38,323 --> 00:36:42,122
I mean, I guess I didn't really know
for sure until I touched Simon.

461
00:36:42,123 --> 00:36:46,122
LIFT OPENS

462
00:36:51,203 --> 00:36:54,442
You shouldn't be watching that.

463
00:36:54,443 --> 00:36:58,002
Do we become famous?

464
00:36:58,003 --> 00:36:59,962
Do you want to be famous?

465
00:36:59,963 --> 00:37:03,962
It's got to be better
than picking up litter.

466
00:37:11,203 --> 00:37:15,202
Sometimes I think
that was the best time of my life.

467
00:37:15,403 --> 00:37:19,402
Does something bad happen to us?

468
00:37:19,723 --> 00:37:23,722
Am I going to die?

469
00:37:24,123 --> 00:37:28,122
I'm not going to let that happen.

470
00:37:28,403 --> 00:37:32,402
So what happens now?

471
00:37:33,963 --> 00:37:37,762
What do you want to happen?

472
00:37:37,763 --> 00:37:41,762
I don't know.

473
00:38:29,483 --> 00:38:33,482
# So I walked into the haze

474
00:38:36,723 --> 00:38:40,722
# And a million dirty ways

475
00:38:45,403 --> 00:38:49,402
# Now I see you lying there

476
00:38:53,643 --> 00:38:57,642
# Like a lilo losing air

477
00:39:01,603 --> 00:39:05,602
# Black rocks and shoreline sand

478
00:39:09,843 --> 00:39:13,842
# Still that summer I cannot bear

479
00:39:17,523 --> 00:39:21,522
# And I wipe the sand from my eyes

480
00:39:25,563 --> 00:39:27,562
# The Spanish Sahara

481
00:39:27,563 --> 00:39:29,442
# The place that you wanna

482
00:39:29,443 --> 00:39:33,082
# Leave the horror here

483
00:39:33,083 --> 00:39:36,202
# Forget the horror, yeah

484
00:39:36,203 --> 00:39:37,962
# Forget the horror... #

485
00:39:37,963 --> 00:39:41,242
Don't take this
the wrong way, but...

486
00:39:41,243 --> 00:39:45,242
You're way better
than I thought you'd be.

487
00:39:45,603 --> 00:39:49,602
I had a good teacher.

488
00:39:49,763 --> 00:39:51,162
You.

489
00:39:51,163 --> 00:39:54,562
I never taught you how to do that.

490
00:39:54,563 --> 00:39:56,522
Not yet.

491
00:39:56,523 --> 00:40:00,442
But you will.

492
00:40:00,443 --> 00:40:04,322
I didn't realise
how much I missed it.

493
00:40:04,323 --> 00:40:08,322
Being able to touch someone.

494
00:40:08,603 --> 00:40:12,602
I can't believe
I've just had sex with you.

495
00:40:14,523 --> 00:40:16,282
You're Simon.

496
00:40:16,283 --> 00:40:20,122
You're still a virgin.

497
00:40:20,123 --> 00:40:24,122
Not for much longer.

498
00:40:25,443 --> 00:40:29,442
Do you lose it with me?

499
00:40:35,723 --> 00:40:38,522
Are you jealous?

500
00:40:38,523 --> 00:40:41,602
Shut up.

501
00:40:41,603 --> 00:40:45,402
I like it that you're jealous.

502
00:40:45,403 --> 00:40:49,402
This is too weird.

503
00:40:55,843 --> 00:40:58,002
So that was
an unexpected turn of events.

504
00:40:58,003 --> 00:41:00,322
You mean you being a big gay?

505
00:41:00,323 --> 00:41:03,082
I'm not a gay. Look at me.

506
00:41:03,083 --> 00:41:06,282
You sure about that?

507
00:41:06,283 --> 00:41:09,842
I'm about 98% certain.
Would you like me to prove it to you?

508
00:41:09,843 --> 00:41:11,562
Go on then.

509
00:41:11,563 --> 00:41:14,842
Really?

510
00:41:14,843 --> 00:41:17,842
Get on with it.

511
00:41:17,843 --> 00:41:20,242
All right.

512
00:41:20,243 --> 00:41:21,522
Prepare to be aroused.

513
00:41:21,523 --> 00:41:25,522
Oh, just kiss me, you dick!

514
00:41:40,923 --> 00:41:44,922
Yeah... Undo this...

515
00:42:03,003 --> 00:42:06,282
I'm not being funny, yeah, but,
is this doing anything for you?

516
00:42:06,283 --> 00:42:09,202
Well, you know I'm a guy.
We're really not that fussy.

517
00:42:09,203 --> 00:42:10,802
It just feels all wrong,

518
00:42:10,803 --> 00:42:13,322
like I'm doing it
with my cousin or something.

519
00:42:13,323 --> 00:42:17,322
Well, I could slip another finger
up there. You know, go two up?

520
00:42:18,043 --> 00:42:19,682
No, it just don't feel right.

521
00:42:19,683 --> 00:42:23,682
You know when you just know?

522
00:42:24,643 --> 00:42:28,282
I just think we should be mates.

523
00:42:28,283 --> 00:42:31,122
After all these weeks' build-up
we're not even going to shag?

524
00:42:31,123 --> 00:42:32,442
Is that what you're saying?

525
00:42:32,443 --> 00:42:33,842
Sorry.

526
00:42:33,843 --> 00:42:37,802
Yeah.

527
00:42:37,803 --> 00:42:41,282
You want to take that out?

528
00:42:41,283 --> 00:42:43,202
Oh, yeah, OK.

529
00:42:43,203 --> 00:42:46,442
Oh, I think it's stuck.

530
00:42:46,443 --> 00:42:46,842
Oh, for fuck's sake!

531
00:42:46,843 --> 00:42:50,842
Oh, for fuck's sake!
Hang on.

532
00:42:51,963 --> 00:42:55,962
Hello!

533
00:42:57,323 --> 00:42:59,362
Mates, yeah?

534
00:42:59,363 --> 00:43:03,362
Yeah, mates.

535
00:43:04,363 --> 00:43:05,922
Big buddies.

536
00:43:05,923 --> 00:43:09,922
Pals.

537
00:43:59,043 --> 00:44:00,642
Hi.

538
00:44:00,643 --> 00:44:04,482
I got to go do my Community Service.

539
00:44:04,483 --> 00:44:08,482
I guess you know that,
cos I'm going to see you there.

540
00:44:11,443 --> 00:44:14,802
So...

541
00:44:14,803 --> 00:44:18,802
Are we seeing each other now?

542
00:44:27,443 --> 00:44:28,962
Yes.

543
00:44:28,963 --> 00:44:31,802
I can't lie to Curtis.

544
00:44:31,803 --> 00:44:33,362
I can't do that to him.

545
00:44:33,363 --> 00:44:35,842
You have to.

546
00:44:35,843 --> 00:44:38,122
What, you want me
to keep on seeing him?

547
00:44:38,123 --> 00:44:42,122
The present me isn't ready
for what has to happen.

548
00:44:44,163 --> 00:44:46,962
You have to give me time.

549
00:44:46,963 --> 00:44:49,282
Will you stop being
so fucking mysterious!

550
00:44:49,283 --> 00:44:55,282
It goes with the territory.
Yeah, well it's annoying!

551
00:44:59,323 --> 00:45:01,802
You have to trust me.

552
00:45:01,803 --> 00:45:05,802
Just let it play out.

553
00:45:10,883 --> 00:45:13,562
What's up with you?

554
00:45:13,563 --> 00:45:15,722
I just realised
I haven't died this week.

555
00:45:15,723 --> 00:45:18,562
It's only Thursday.
There's still time.

556
00:45:18,563 --> 00:45:22,202
Now why would you say
something like that? Twat!

557
00:45:22,203 --> 00:45:25,802
So you don't love me any more?
OK. So I loved you. Big deal.

558
00:45:25,803 --> 00:45:28,162
I think we should talk about it.

559
00:45:28,163 --> 00:45:29,482
I so want to hear this.

560
00:45:29,483 --> 00:45:31,162
If we'd have...

561
00:45:31,163 --> 00:45:33,722
That would've been
the best sex you've ever had.

562
00:45:33,723 --> 00:45:37,002
Correction. That would've been
the only sex you've ever had.

563
00:45:37,003 --> 00:45:39,882
Do you ever get embarrassed
of anything? Not really, no.

564
00:45:39,883 --> 00:45:41,402
We done?

565
00:45:41,403 --> 00:45:43,962
You know that fella in the mask?

566
00:45:43,963 --> 00:45:46,482
How did he know
that Vince was allergic to nuts?

567
00:45:46,483 --> 00:45:49,082
I told you.
He seems to know everything.

568
00:45:49,083 --> 00:45:53,082
We need to find out who he is.

569
00:45:53,763 --> 00:45:57,762
Can't we just let him do his thing?
I mean seriously, who cares?

570
00:46:00,323 --> 00:46:04,322
That's a bald fanny!

571
00:46:06,163 --> 00:46:10,162
Oh, they love it!

572
00:46:10,563 --> 00:46:14,562
Bosh!

573
00:46:18,163 --> 00:46:21,762
He's going to be doing his Community
Service thing with you lot.

574
00:46:21,763 --> 00:46:23,962
Are you saying he's like
a new member of the gang?

575
00:46:23,963 --> 00:46:25,922
We can't let the new guy
find out about our powers.

576
00:46:25,923 --> 00:46:28,522
Have any of you
got one of these weird powers?

577
00:46:28,523 --> 00:46:29,842
Things with us...

578
00:46:29,843 --> 00:46:32,202
They haven't been right
for a while now.

579
00:46:32,203 --> 00:46:33,362
You're different.

580
00:46:33,363 --> 00:46:37,082
If you're done being
all super-heroey with your clocks,

581
00:46:37,083 --> 00:46:41,082
you can come back to bed.

582
00:46:41,283 --> 00:46:42,642
He's fucking crazy!

583
00:46:42,643 --> 00:46:45,162
Do you think he was talking
about this fella?

584
00:46:45,163 --> 00:46:46,762
I want my money.

585
00:46:46,763 --> 00:46:49,002
All we need is 100 grand.

586
00:46:49,003 --> 00:46:50,162
Let's rob a bank.

587
00:46:50,163 --> 00:46:53,562
This is not real. It's just a game!
You think this is a game?

588
00:46:53,563 --> 00:46:57,562
This is my life.

589
