Yes.

It's just a game!

Don't die. I love you.

00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:22,199
He'll still be here.

8
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:25,839
No, I don't love him. I love you.

9
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:29,839
It's you falling in love with him
that makes him become me.

Sorry. I was just, er...

Oh, come on,
if that was me bent over,

wearing a lovely pair of knickers,

you're telling me you wouldn't treat
yourself to a good eyeful?

I don't know.

79

being savagely beaten to death.

No. I'm universally popular

00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:38,039
See, why would you even say
something like that?

89
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:40,519
That's very hurtful.
I thought we were friends,

90

you ungrateful little twat.

91
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:43,199
Don't speak to him like that.

Do you love him?

94
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:50,719
Oh, look, why don't you go and suck
yourself off?

95
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:53,159

I can never reach it.

We've all tried, huh?

98

I tied a rope to my feet

99

six pillows...

this conversation.

physically impossible.

suck themselves off,

I know what they like.

and I was in the locker rooms,
watching her getting changed.

Oh, nice(!)

142
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:08,479
No, I walked in on her.

Are you going to do the run?

00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:25,759
I was never very good at running.

148
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:28,199

I said that. I'm sorry.

Because I'm really attracted to you.

Are you talking to me, mate?

You see a guy in a grey hoodie come through
here? Your height, kind of funny-looking?

Where is he?

179
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:10,759
He went out the back door. Start
running if you want to catch him.

180
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:11,959
Are you dicking with me?

181
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:15,319
No. I love the police.

182

What do you mean, she killed you?

186
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:39,119
I mean she smashed my head
against a sink like this,

187
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:43,119
until my brains dribbled out
of my ears.

188
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:45,839
She wouldn't do that.

You don't know anything about her.

It all adds up. Do the maths.

plus no-one else was around.

she's here in the community centre.

So?

200
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:20,479
So, I remember a similar scenario
that resulted in me

201
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,319
having sex with an
82-year-old woman.

202
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:24,839
Then that shape-shifter girl.
She was mental.

00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:27,679
Look what happened with you
and that probation worker.

204
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:31,679
And did you know that some of these
marathon runners shit themselves?

205
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:37,959
So, you think that if a girl
likes me,

206
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:40,839
there must be something wrong
with her?

363
00:23:12,639 --> 00:23:16,638
Ow!

364
00:23:20,679 --> 00:23:24,678
Whoo!

365
00:23:28,319 --> 00:23:30,598
She said, "I'm Rosie"

366
00:23:30,599 --> 00:23:31,878
I said, "I thought you were Lucy"

367
00:23:31,879 --> 00:23:33,238
She said, "No, Rosie
I told you so"

368
00:23:33,239 --> 00:23:34,958
Was here with your sister
but she's going out the back

369
00:23:34,959 --> 00:23:37,118
I wanna dance and have fun
you know

370
00:23:37,119 --> 00:23:38,838
Of all the shitty little places
I meet you

371
00:23:38,839 --> 00:23:40,078
It's here, and I'm freaking out

372
00:23:40,079 --> 00:23:43,358
I heard you got a brand-new name
selling Es in the dark

373
00:23:43,359 --> 00:23:44,798
But it's nothing to shout about

374
00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:48,798
Don't just say yes to tease me

375
00:23:49,159 --> 00:23:52,518
Do your utmost to please me

376
00:23:52,519 --> 00:23:55,998
I don't mean to be sleazy

377
00:23:55,999 --> 00:23:59,998
Being you can't be easy... 

378
00:24:08,279 --> 00:24:12,278
If I had your power...
I'd wait until I was coming

379
00:24:13,279 --> 00:24:17,278
and I'd rewind a couple of seconds...
and just...

380
00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:22,438
hover in the moment.

381
00:24:22,439 --> 00:24:27,478
Oh! Oh!

382
00:24:27,479 --> 00:24:30,798
Zhoozh!

383
00:24:30,799 --> 00:24:33,558
(GASPS) Oh!

384
00:24:33,559 --> 00:24:36,318
Oh! Oh!

385
00:24:36,319 --> 00:24:38,438
You're too good at faking it.

386
00:24:38,439 --> 00:24:40,358
(LAUGHS)

387
00:24:40,359 --> 00:24:42,318
Most people would want to do
something useful,

388
00:24:42,319 --> 00:24:45,998
like go back in time
and kill Hitler or something.

389
00:24:45,999 --> 00:24:48,158
Right.

390
00:24:48,159 --> 00:24:51,678
But after...after I'm done killing
Hitler,

391
00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:55,678
I'm doing the thing with the orgasms.

392
00:25:04,342 --> 00:25:07,341
He was lying right here, all right?

393
00:25:07,342 --> 00:25:09,381
Blood was all pouring
out of his throat,

394
00:25:09,382 --> 00:25:11,421
and he was all gurgling and shit.
Urgh!

395
00:25:11,422 --> 00:25:14,421
So, where is he now?

396
00:25:14,422 --> 00:25:15,941
She's moved the body.

397
00:25:15,942 --> 00:25:19,941
Right, huh? Who leaves a dead body
lying around to be discovered?

398
00:25:19,982 --> 00:25:22,301
We never do and we're not exactly
the most competent killers.

399
00:25:22,302 --> 00:25:26,301
And how did she do that
when she was in the bar with me?

400
00:25:28,822 --> 00:25:31,341
Why would I make it up?

401
00:25:31,342 --> 00:25:32,501
Maybe you're jealous.

402
00:25:32,502 --> 00:25:35,101
Look at me - beautiful.

403
00:25:35,102 --> 00:25:38,141
Look at you - not so much.

404
00:25:38,142 --> 00:25:41,261
So, why am I here?

405
00:25:41,262 --> 00:25:43,061
I don't know.

406
00:25:43,062 --> 00:25:45,541
You stay away from Jessica.

407
00:25:45,542 --> 00:25:47,381
You stay away from her.

408
00:25:47,382 --> 00:25:49,741
No.

409
00:25:49,742 --> 00:25:53,741
Well, I think you should.

410
00:26:13,195 --> 00:26:17,034
I'm sorry I had to leave early
yesterday. I...

411
00:26:17,035 --> 00:26:20,834
It's fine.

412
00:26:20,835 --> 00:26:24,834
Er...the charity's having
a fancy dress party tonight.

413
00:26:26,195 --> 00:26:29,034
I thought you and your friends...

414
00:26:29,035 --> 00:26:32,114
I thought you might like to come.

415
00:26:32,115 --> 00:26:36,114
Thanks.

416
00:26:39,355 --> 00:26:43,354
Well, I...I should
get to the start.

417
00:26:43,435 --> 00:26:46,514
Come and find me afterwards.

418
00:26:46,515 --> 00:26:50,514
Good luck.

419
00:26:50,595 --> 00:26:54,594
Oh.

420
00:26:57,475 --> 00:26:59,954
Look, what's so difficult
to believe?

421
00:26:59,955 --> 00:27:02,114
Did you actually see her kill him?

422
00:27:02,115 --> 00:27:06,114
No. I didn't have to. It was written
all over her cute little face.

423
00:27:06,755 --> 00:27:12,114
I'm telling you, there's something
seriously wrong with this girl. Shh.

424
00:27:12,115 --> 00:27:16,114
Jessica's invited us
to a fancy dress party tonight.

425
00:27:19,315 --> 00:27:23,314
You know what?
You were right, man. I was jealous.

426
00:27:23,355 --> 00:27:25,154
I'm jealous of your, er...

427
00:27:25,155 --> 00:27:29,034
neat hair and your...
the strange staring

428
00:27:29,035 --> 00:27:31,794
that the ladies
seem to love so much.

429
00:27:31,795 --> 00:27:33,874
And I hope that you and, er...

430
00:27:33,875 --> 00:27:37,714
Jessica.Jessica.
Lovely, lovely Jessica.

431
00:27:37,715 --> 00:27:41,514
I hope you'll be
very happy together.

432
00:27:41,515 --> 00:27:43,714
You'll find your own girlfriend.

433
00:27:43,715 --> 00:27:46,834
All ready got one, mate.

434
00:27:46,835 --> 00:27:48,394
Who is she?

435
00:27:48,395 --> 00:27:51,034
(SIGHS)

436
00:27:51,035 --> 00:27:55,034
Mo...ni...ca.

437
00:27:58,075 --> 00:27:59,994
(CLEARS THROAT) She's French.

438
00:27:59,995 --> 00:28:02,994
You should invite her to the party.

439
00:28:02,995 --> 00:28:05,874
She's in France, what with
being all French and that.

440
00:28:05,875 --> 00:28:09,874
But seeing as this party's happening ten
feet from my bedroom, I will see you there.

441
00:28:18,235 --> 00:28:20,994
Are you serious?
When am I ever serious?

442
00:28:20,995 --> 00:28:24,394
But we need to be there
to keep an eye on her, right?

443
00:28:24,395 --> 00:28:26,154
It's a fancy-dress party.

444
00:28:26,155 --> 00:28:28,874
It's dark.
You'll all be wearing masks.

445
00:28:28,875 --> 00:28:32,874
It's the perfect opportunity
to commit murder. And incest!

446
00:28:33,035 --> 00:28:35,674
Who's Mo...ni...ca?

447
00:28:35,675 --> 00:28:38,154
That is the worst made-up name
I've ever heard.

448
00:28:38,155 --> 00:28:40,434
You know,
names never were my strong point.

449
00:28:40,435 --> 00:28:44,434
But I think
the whole French thing sold it.

450
00:28:44,595 --> 00:28:48,594
Prick!
Sorry, mate.

451
00:28:56,555 --> 00:28:59,194
What are you doing?

452
00:28:59,195 --> 00:29:03,194
I wanted to see you.

453
00:29:07,275 --> 00:29:10,354
There's this party tonight.
It's fancy dress

454
00:29:10,355 --> 00:29:14,354
and it'll probably be really shit.

455
00:29:14,595 --> 00:29:18,594
I'll be there.

456
00:29:24,835 --> 00:29:28,394
Boom-boom, baby
La-la, la-la, la-la

Bruno.

465
00:30:00,755 --> 00:30:03,794
Take it easy! What you doing?

466
00:30:03,795 --> 00:30:07,794
Stop it! Get off!

467
00:30:07,915 --> 00:30:11,274
Fuck off!

468
00:30:11,275 --> 00:30:15,274
You hurt me!

469
00:30:30,952 --> 00:30:34,951
How did it go?
I beat my personal best.

470
00:30:35,232 --> 00:30:39,231
That's great.

471
00:31:03,152 --> 00:31:07,151
What?
I have something I have to tell you.

472
00:31:07,392 --> 00:31:10,231
Jess?
It's my dad.

473
00:31:10,232 --> 00:31:14,231
I'll tell you at the party.

474
00:31:16,552 --> 00:31:20,551
Dad. This is Simon.

475
00:31:23,232 --> 00:31:27,231
Hello, sir.

476
00:31:29,352 --> 00:31:33,351
Dad.

477
00:31:38,872 --> 00:31:42,871
We should get some lunch.

478
00:31:51,192 --> 00:31:55,191
(CLICKS FINGERS) We should be
getting into our costumes!

479
00:31:55,232 --> 00:31:58,191
(SIGHS) What's up with you?

480
00:31:58,192 --> 00:31:59,631
Nothing.

481
00:31:59,632 --> 00:32:02,551
You haven't been this quiet
since you got turned bald.

482
00:32:02,552 --> 00:32:05,071
Can you leave us alone, yeah?
All right.

483
00:32:05,072 --> 00:32:09,071

Nice costume.

489
00:33:11,832 --> 00:33:14,071
Er...she looks like a slut.
Yeah.

It's me.

493
00:33:37,272 --> 00:33:41,271
What do you want?
Give me a chance to explain.

494
00:33:41,472 --> 00:33:44,551
I ain't interested in anything
you've got to say.

that I've been looking for.

on my dress.

That's what happens when you knock
girls around.

It's not like that.

I'm still...working out how to be
around women.

Sometimes it's like my instincts
