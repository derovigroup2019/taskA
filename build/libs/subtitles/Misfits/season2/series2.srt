Who are you?

3
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:04,999
Who are you?
Your new probation worker.

4
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,799
What happened
to the other probation worker?

5
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:10,799
I didn't mean to kill her,
it was an accident!

6
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:13,199
'So who was it who saved your life?'

7
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:17,199
Some guy in a mask.

Ah, come on! Who says you can't
have an ASBO and an all-over tan?

00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:10,199
I'm looking for Nathan.

17
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:14,199
Why? Why're you looking for him?
Who are you?

18
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:17,919
I'm his brother.

19
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:21,639
I haven't got a brother. I'm
a classic example of an only child.

20
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:23,199
Not any more.

21
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,719
How is that even possible?

22
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:28,719
We've got the same dad.

23
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:31,279
And you're sure about that?

24
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:33,639
He didn't tell you about me?

25
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:37,639
I guess it slipped his mind.

26
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:43,959
Yeah, OK.

27
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:47,959

Oh, hiya, Dad,
it's your son...Nathan.

37
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:41,319
So here's the thing -
my brother came to see me today.

38
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:44,799
But I haven't got a brother!
So who's this? It's my brother?

39
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:47,759
What the fuck?!

40
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:51,239
Anyway, so, um...call me.

Where's Nathan?

44
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:20,359
He's in the locker room.

45
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:23,919
Oh, that's funny, because I was
just in there, I didn't see him.

46
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:27,039
He had a family emergency.
What kind of emergency?

47
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,439
His brother came to see him.

48
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:29,999
And how is that an emergency?

49
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,639
He's got cancer.

50
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:32,919
Oh, really?

51
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:36,919
Yeah, his brother was like
crying and shit. It was really sad.
Think he needed a drink.

52
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:41,599
Oh, so Nathan's taken him
to the pub, has he?

53
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:49,159
His brother hasn't
got cancer, has he?
He might have.

54
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:53,159
He should feel for lumps...
in his testicles.

55
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:59,079
Right.

56
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:01,799
So how was it with Dad
when you saw him?

57
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:04,799
Yeah, it was all right,
you know, it was OK.

58
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:07,239
Let me take a wild guess -
he was a useless twat?

59
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,799
Pretty much, yeah.

60
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,399
Yeah, that's our dad for you.

61
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,919
Don't take it too personally, though.

62
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:16,919
Hey, fuck him.

63
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:28,119
Who's she?

64
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:33,159
Oh! Let's just say,
been there, boof! Done that.

65
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:38,239
Beautiful burger nipples.

66
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:41,399

D'you like that?

68
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:44,119
Yeah, what's not to like?

69
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:48,119
I love burgers, I love breasts.
It's like a meal deal!

70
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:53,359

71
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:57,359
Yeah.

00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:00,959
Hey...

73
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:04,959
Fuck off.

cheapest lager, please.

75
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:33,159
So how would you feel
about having sex with me?

76
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:36,199
I would, but I have
this thing about having sex

77
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:40,199
with bouffant-haired wankers.

78
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:47,639
Whoa!

79
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:50,079
Cool power.

80
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:53,599
Don't sweat it, I'm immortal.

81
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:57,599
Seriously?

82
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,039
I thought it was just me.

83
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:03,359
No, no. I've died twice
in the last two weeks.

84
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,519
Anyway, who are you calling bouffant?

85
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,839
Your hair - it's quite big.

86
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:09,879
Well, I like to give the ladies
something to hold onto.

87
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:12,079
That's very thoughtful of you.

88
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:13,599
I'm a very thoughtful person.

89
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:16,719
Here, what is it with you
and breaking the glasses?

90
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:19,199
Sorry.

91
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:21,239
Clean it up!

92
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:23,839
Who's the cunt?

93
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:24,919
THUMP!

94
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:28,559
What a pussy!
You want me to go back in there
and kick the shit out of him?

95
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:30,639
No, leave it. Leave it, leave it.

96
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:33,559
It's probably for the best,
you know? Move on.

97
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:35,919
Are you all right?
I can't believe he did that.

98
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:39,639
I feel really bad.

99
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:41,719
Call me sometime.

100
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:45,719
Oh. Yeah, I'll do that.

101
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:51,719
And that, little brother,
is how you pull women.

102
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:09,239
My car. My car's gone!

103
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:10,879
What d'you mean?

104
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:14,879
It was parked, right here,
it's gone!

105
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:19,719
Welcome to the neighbourhood.

106
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:21,399
Fuck, shit. Shit!

107
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:23,079
Hey, hey. Could have been worse.

108
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:27,079
Last week, someone was thrown off
one of those towers. It was carnage.

109
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:33,919
Dad was in the boot.

110
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:38,239
Dad? Our Dad?

111
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:40,319
Why was he in the boot of your car?

112
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,199
Cos he's a twat!

113
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:44,159
I think I'm going to need a little
bit more information than that.

114
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:46,679
I went to see him.

115
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:50,399
It's like he didn't want to
be bothered with me. I lost it.

116
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:52,159
I hit him with a toaster.

117
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:53,839
You hit him with a toaster?!

118
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:56,559
And then you put him
in the boot of your car?!

119
00:08:56,560 --> 00:09:00,039
I was going to make him apologise to
Mum for being such a wanker to her.

120
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:03,559
Oh, well! I'm sure that
would've been a touching reunion!

121
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:05,759
I was going to let him out.
And then you say,

122
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:09,759
"Let's go for a beer." "Sure,
I'll just let Dad out of the boot."

123
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:12,999
Was he all right
when you put him in there?

124
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,559
He wasn't too happy.

125
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:18,359
I can't say I'm entirely surprised.
Are you out of your fucking mind?!

126
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:22,359
Fuck you! He was there for you!
You don't know how this feels!

127
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:26,359
You don't know!

128
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:45,479
I suppose we better go
and find our dad.

129
00:09:45,569 --> 00:09:48,968
I spent ages thinking what it would
be like to meet him, you know?

130
00:09:48,969 --> 00:09:50,528
What I'd say or what he'd say.

131
00:09:50,529 --> 00:09:53,728
He didn't even turn the fuckin'
TV off. Fuckin' MasterChef!

132
00:09:53,729 --> 00:09:56,328
Whatever ideas you had
about touching scenes

133
00:09:56,329 --> 00:09:58,808
of father and son, forget about it.

134
00:09:58,809 --> 00:10:02,808
OK? He's not interested.

135
00:10:03,409 --> 00:10:07,408
I'm sorry, man.

136
00:10:14,849 --> 00:10:18,848
Please tell me that's not your car.

137
00:10:19,089 --> 00:10:21,888
(BOTH COUGH)

138
00:10:21,889 --> 00:10:23,408
Is it yours? Is it?!

139
00:10:23,409 --> 00:10:25,928
I don't know! I don't know!
It could be!

140
00:10:25,929 --> 00:10:29,608
Dad!

141
00:10:29,609 --> 00:10:30,848
Ow!

142
00:10:30,849 --> 00:10:34,848
Shit!

143
00:10:36,529 --> 00:10:39,048
Oh, my God, thank you!
Oh, thank you, God.

144
00:10:39,049 --> 00:10:41,288
Jesus.

145
00:10:42,889 --> 00:10:44,368
That's my car!

146
00:10:44,369 --> 00:10:46,368
That...that's my car!

147
00:10:46,369 --> 00:10:49,688
Hey! Our dad's in the boot! Hey!

148
00:10:49,689 --> 00:10:53,688
Our dad's in the boot!

149
00:11:10,449 --> 00:11:12,128
OK, here's the plan -

150
00:11:12,129 --> 00:11:15,648
I'll provoke them into chasing me,
and you get the car. OK?

151
00:11:15,649 --> 00:11:17,648
Yeah?

152
00:11:17,649 --> 00:11:21,648
All right.

153
00:11:30,649 --> 00:11:33,888
Are you doing business?

154
00:11:33,889 --> 00:11:34,768
You want gear?

155
00:11:34,769 --> 00:11:38,328
You want gear?
No, no. The other kind
of business. You know...

156
00:11:38,329 --> 00:11:40,848
You're very cute.

157
00:11:40,849 --> 00:11:44,848
You, not so much, but there's
always room for a little one.

158
00:11:46,529 --> 00:11:47,968
You taking the piss?

159
00:11:47,969 --> 00:11:50,048
Shall we say, er, a hundred quid?

160
00:11:50,049 --> 00:11:53,408
I'm thinking,
I do you, you do me,

161
00:11:53,409 --> 00:11:56,408
we all end up in a hot tub.
All right, all right,

162
00:11:56,409 --> 00:11:58,848
there's an extra 20 in it
if you tie me up

163
00:11:58,849 --> 00:12:00,808
and hit my balls with a cactus.

164
00:12:00,809 --> 00:12:01,848
(LAUGHS)

165
00:12:01,849 --> 00:12:03,808
(LAUGHS)
(LAUGHS WEAKLY)

166
00:12:03,809 --> 00:12:07,808
(CONTINUES TO LAUGH)

167
00:12:17,489 --> 00:12:19,208
Hundred quid, yeah?

168
00:12:19,209 --> 00:12:23,208
Yep.

169
00:12:23,729 --> 00:12:27,408
Let's go somewhere more private.

170
00:12:27,409 --> 00:12:31,008
OK.

171
00:12:43,089 --> 00:12:47,088
Let's see the money, then, mate.

172
00:12:48,529 --> 00:12:51,568
Let's see your cocks. I want to
know what I'm working with,

173
00:12:51,569 --> 00:12:52,608
so I can prepare...

174
00:12:52,609 --> 00:12:53,688
CAR ENGINE STARTS

175
00:12:53,689 --> 00:12:56,168
mentally and physically...

176
00:12:56,169 --> 00:13:00,168
Give me the fucking money!

177
00:13:01,329 --> 00:13:02,008
Oh, shit!

178
00:13:02,009 --> 00:13:06,008
Oh, shit!
Give me the fucking money.

179
00:13:06,649 --> 00:13:10,648
SHOUTING

180
00:13:24,569 --> 00:13:25,768
Come on!

181
00:13:25,769 --> 00:13:27,248
Can't believe we done that!

182
00:13:27,249 --> 00:13:30,008
We're like the Mitchell brothers,
only we're not bald, ugly and shit!

183
00:13:30,009 --> 00:13:31,528
Go on!

184
00:13:31,529 --> 00:13:35,528
Ha-ha!
(SIGHS WITH RELIEF)

185
00:13:35,929 --> 00:13:39,248
KNOCKING

186
00:13:39,249 --> 00:13:43,248
We should probably let
Dad out of the boot.

187
00:13:44,129 --> 00:13:46,688
Come here, you little
fuckin' bucket of piss!

188
00:13:46,689 --> 00:13:49,088
All right, look, listen.
I'll untie you,

189
00:13:49,089 --> 00:13:52,128
but I want you to
promise me that you won't be angry.

190
00:13:52,129 --> 00:13:54,168
(MUFFLED ANGRY SCREAMING)

191
00:13:54,169 --> 00:13:55,648
OK, he's not going for it.

192
00:13:55,649 --> 00:13:58,328
Come on, now,
let's get him out of there.

193
00:13:58,329 --> 00:13:59,768
(MUFFLED SHOUTING)

194
00:13:59,769 --> 00:14:01,568
Stop wriggling!

195
00:14:01,569 --> 00:14:03,368
SIRENS APPROACH

196
00:14:03,369 --> 00:14:07,368
Ow, stop! Stop!

197
00:14:09,089 --> 00:14:13,088
Shit!

198
00:14:19,369 --> 00:14:20,648
It's complicated.

199
00:14:20,649 --> 00:14:23,088
(SCOFFS)
Try me.

200
00:14:23,089 --> 00:14:25,568
I didn't see the point
in telling you about him.

201
00:14:25,569 --> 00:14:27,528
It would have just upset your mother.

202
00:14:27,529 --> 00:14:29,728
Upset her more than
you cheating on her,

203
00:14:29,729 --> 00:14:33,728
or walking out on us and just
generally being a complete twat?

204
00:14:37,609 --> 00:14:41,608
And you never even
tried to contact him?

205
00:14:43,089 --> 00:14:45,048
Brilliant(!) Yeah.

206
00:14:45,049 --> 00:14:47,688
First class parenting there,
Dad, well done(!)

207
00:14:47,689 --> 00:14:50,368
I thought about seeing him.

208
00:14:50,369 --> 00:14:54,368
The longer it went on, it just...
got harder.

209
00:14:54,369 --> 00:14:57,128
And you wonder why he hit you
in the head with a toaster

210
00:14:57,129 --> 00:14:58,328
and put you in the boot?

211
00:14:58,329 --> 00:15:01,688
He just turned up out of the blue.
I didn't know what to say to him!

212
00:15:01,689 --> 00:15:04,208
(SIGHS)

213
00:15:04,209 --> 00:15:08,208
Even for you,
that is just unbelievably shit.

214
00:15:10,489 --> 00:15:14,048
Like you never got anything wrong.
We're not so different, you know.

215
00:15:14,049 --> 00:15:15,608
We're completely different.

216
00:15:15,609 --> 00:15:18,248
I'm gracefully tall,
you're freakishly short.

217
00:15:18,249 --> 00:15:20,248
Where do you get this stuff?

218
00:15:20,249 --> 00:15:23,128
I don't know, it just comes to me,
I have a gift.

219
00:15:23,129 --> 00:15:26,328
So...what are you
going to do about him?

220
00:15:26,329 --> 00:15:28,008
Well, what am I supposed to do?

221
00:15:28,009 --> 00:15:31,408
You're supposed to be a dad to him.

222
00:15:31,409 --> 00:15:32,888
Well, I don't even know him.

223
00:15:32,889 --> 00:15:36,208
Yeah? What's your excuse with me?

224
00:15:36,209 --> 00:15:38,528
Every time I try to work things
out with you,

225
00:15:38,529 --> 00:15:40,088
you throw it back in my face.

226
00:15:40,089 --> 00:15:43,088
Don't change the subject!
We're talking about your other son!

227
00:15:43,089 --> 00:15:46,408
The little shit should be grateful
I am not pressing charges!

228
00:15:46,409 --> 00:15:48,888
You know what?
He's better off not knowing you!

229
00:15:48,889 --> 00:15:52,888
I wish, I wish I was him!

230
00:16:01,009 --> 00:16:03,648
Where are you going?

231
00:16:03,649 --> 00:16:04,768
That's right, Dad.

232
00:16:04,769 --> 00:16:08,768
Walk away with your tiny little
legs, you fucking midget!

233
00:16:12,889 --> 00:16:16,888
DOOR OPENS

234
00:16:17,489 --> 00:16:18,968
Where's Dad?

235
00:16:18,969 --> 00:16:22,168
He's gone.

236
00:16:22,169 --> 00:16:26,168
Come on.

237
00:17:42,689 --> 00:17:46,688
(PANTS)

238
00:17:53,675 --> 00:17:58,274
See you later?
See you, man.

239
00:17:58,275 --> 00:18:02,034
Is your brother
staying with you?

240
00:18:02,035 --> 00:18:04,274
Yeah. I've always
wanted a brother.

241
00:18:04,275 --> 00:18:05,954
Someone to idolise me.

242
00:18:05,955 --> 00:18:08,554
I can advise him,
teach him stuff.

243
00:18:08,555 --> 00:18:10,034
Like what?

244
00:18:10,035 --> 00:18:12,514
Like, er...

245
00:18:12,515 --> 00:18:15,114
Does he know how to dance?

246
00:18:15,115 --> 00:18:16,954
Do you?

247
00:18:16,955 --> 00:18:20,954
Well, I'll get lessons, cos that's
what brothers do for each other.

248
00:18:23,475 --> 00:18:25,114
You got any brothers?

249
00:18:25,115 --> 00:18:29,114
A sister.

250
00:18:29,755 --> 00:18:33,674
Is she cute? You should think about
getting me and her together.

251
00:18:33,675 --> 00:18:37,674
Hey, man. Someone's going to.
Better it be a close friend.

252
00:18:38,435 --> 00:18:42,434
Someone you trust to be gentle,
and respectful.

253
00:18:42,715 --> 00:18:44,234
Me.

254
00:18:44,235 --> 00:18:45,914
She's 12!

255
00:18:45,915 --> 00:18:49,914
Oh! Probably best to leave it
a couple of years, then.

256
00:18:53,835 --> 00:18:56,154
Something you want
to tell me?

257
00:18:56,155 --> 00:19:00,154
If it's the booze missing from the
kitchen, I know nothing about that!

258
00:19:00,875 --> 00:19:03,914
It's about you disappearing
to the pub yesterday.

259
00:19:03,915 --> 00:19:04,594
Oh...that.

260
00:19:04,595 --> 00:19:06,354
Oh...that.
Yeah!

261
00:19:06,355 --> 00:19:09,154
Forget the booze, then.

262
00:19:09,155 --> 00:19:11,154
Don't take the piss.

263
00:19:11,155 --> 00:19:15,154
I never do.

264
00:19:22,155 --> 00:19:26,154
SNIGGERING

265
00:19:28,915 --> 00:19:32,514
That's not so special!

266
00:19:32,515 --> 00:19:33,794
Whatever!

267
00:19:33,795 --> 00:19:37,394
(CURTIS) Who is this guy?
I don't know. He was following me.

268
00:19:37,395 --> 00:19:42,474
I think he might have sent the note
telling us to go to Nathan's grave.
Does he know about our powers?

269
00:19:42,475 --> 00:19:46,474
Yeah. He kinda reminds me
of the guy who rescued me.

270
00:19:47,155 --> 00:19:50,114
Er...did I miss something?

271
00:19:50,115 --> 00:19:52,954
Oh, yes. I got surrounded
by a whole bunch

272
00:19:52,955 --> 00:19:55,634
of those "virtue" virgins,
right? I was just about

273
00:19:55,635 --> 00:19:59,354
to kick three kinds of shit
out of them...girls included.

274
00:19:59,355 --> 00:20:03,354
This fella swoops in on his BMX, all
dramatic like, and gives me a backie.

275
00:20:03,475 --> 00:20:05,034
He can pedal! I'll give him that.

276
00:20:05,035 --> 00:20:08,394
When were you gonna tell us?
I didn't think it was relevant.

277
00:20:08,395 --> 00:20:12,394
A masked guy appears out
of nowhere and rescues you?
How is that not relevant?

278
00:20:12,835 --> 00:20:15,474
All right, I'm sorry,
I forgot!
LIQUID HISSES

279
00:20:15,475 --> 00:20:18,874
We need to find him.
Look, if he wants to dick around, >

280
00:20:18,875 --> 00:20:22,474
trying to be a super-hero, let him.
Who has time for that shit?

281
00:20:22,475 --> 00:20:26,474
Right! He's just a chancer, chancing
it. What does he actually know?

282
00:20:26,515 --> 00:20:28,514
He seems to know everything.

283
00:20:28,515 --> 00:20:29,834
We're going out tonight.
Are you coming?

284
00:20:29,835 --> 00:20:31,434
We're going out tonight.
Are you coming?
Oh, yeah, cool, man.

285
00:20:31,435 --> 00:20:35,434
I'll bring my little brother.
We are gonna be knee deep in pussy!

286
00:20:35,515 --> 00:20:38,034
You ain't even getting a sniff!

287
00:20:38,035 --> 00:20:41,514
(SCOFFS) Hang on! What's this?!

288
00:20:41,515 --> 00:20:45,514
The phone number of a beautiful girl.
I think someone's getting laid!

289
00:20:46,235 --> 00:20:47,874
And you think I give a shit?

290
00:20:47,875 --> 00:20:51,394
Ooh!

291
00:20:51,395 --> 00:20:55,394
She's so into me and
she doesn't even know it.

292
00:21:02,395 --> 00:21:05,394
I think you should go and see
our useless prick of a dad.

293
00:21:05,395 --> 00:21:06,874
Yeah, right.

294
00:21:06,875 --> 00:21:10,634
Just cos I have a shite relationship
with him doesn't mean you have to.

295
00:21:10,635 --> 00:21:16,034
If he's not interested in you,
why would he be different with me?
Well, you know...

296
00:21:16,035 --> 00:21:19,954
Some would probably say I wasn't
the easiest kid in the world.

297
00:21:19,955 --> 00:21:23,354
(SNIGGERS) Maybe you should try
and sort things out?

298
00:21:23,355 --> 00:21:27,354
Too much shit's happened
between me and him.

299
00:21:29,475 --> 00:21:31,834
I was so jealous of you...

300
00:21:31,835 --> 00:21:35,834
I thought you and him
would be big mates.

301
00:21:36,275 --> 00:21:38,794
My eighth birthday, right.

302
00:21:38,795 --> 00:21:42,794
He's supposed to be taking me out
for the day, so he takes me to IKEA.

303
00:21:42,875 --> 00:21:46,874
He buys so much flat-pack furniture,
there's no room for me in the car,

304
00:21:46,915 --> 00:21:49,514
so he leaves me there
for three hours!

305
00:21:49,515 --> 00:21:53,154
Then some guy with a beard sees me
hanging around and buys me lunch.

306
00:21:53,155 --> 00:21:57,154
I spent my eighth birthday
eating Swedish meatballs
with a known paedophile!

307
00:21:57,395 --> 00:21:59,114
Did he...?

308
00:21:59,115 --> 00:22:01,954
No, no! Dad got back as we were
finishing our ice cream,

309
00:22:01,955 --> 00:22:05,954
but that sick pervert cared
more about me than Dad ever did.

310
00:22:08,035 --> 00:22:12,034
He would've taken me to the zoo.

00:22:47,275 --> 00:22:48,514

Sorry. I'm trying not
to be such a cold bitch.

331
00:24:03,195 --> 00:24:05,474
Cold. As in, you know. frigid?

332
00:24:05,475 --> 00:24:07,594
I have intimacy issues, OK?

333
00:24:07,595 --> 00:24:09,874
OK, OK! In my experience,

334
00:24:09,875 --> 00:24:13,874
there isn't any problem that can't be
solved by getting really drunk.

335
00:24:20,995 --> 00:24:24,994
Hey, my brother doesn't know anything
about the whole power thing, so...

336
00:24:25,795 --> 00:24:29,794
Cheers, man.
All right, man.

00:24:33,595 --> 00:24:37,594
You all right?
Very!

338
00:24:40,395 --> 00:24:42,874
You up for a pill?
Yeah, thanks.

339
00:24:42,875 --> 00:24:46,874
You can have two.

00:24:48,915 --> 00:24:50,034
Cheers.

00:24:50,035 --> 00:24:52,034

00:25:50,755 --> 00:25:53,954
They're not cattle!
Show them some respect!

351
00:25:53,955 --> 00:25:56,194
Just choose one!

352
00:25:56,195 --> 00:26:00,194
Eeny, meeny, miny, moe.
Catch a liar by the toe.

353
00:26:00,195 --> 00:26:04,194
If she hollers, let her go.
Eeny, meeny, miny, moe!

354
00:26:07,795 --> 00:26:09,874
Oh, fine! You have the pretty one!

355
00:26:09,875 --> 00:26:12,714
Sweet!
Yeah!

356
00:26:12,715 --> 00:26:16,714
Yeah, yeah, whatever!

357
00:26:18,435 --> 00:26:21,154
I thought she was with you?

358
00:26:21,155 --> 00:26:24,554
Who?

359
00:26:24,555 --> 00:26:27,954
No! That was just an elaborate
plan to make you jealous.

360
00:26:27,955 --> 00:26:34,194
I can't even remember her name.
You don't remember anyone's name.

361
00:26:36,035 --> 00:26:39,154
There's some seriously weird shit
going on with your eyes!

362
00:26:39,155 --> 00:26:42,914
I think this pill's kicking in.
Why're you interested in me?

363
00:26:42,915 --> 00:26:45,474
You can get loads of prettier girls.
No, I didn't mean to say that.

364
00:26:45,475 --> 00:26:49,474
So what if there are? I like you
and...there's no explaining that.

365
00:26:50,115 --> 00:26:53,634
What if you think I'm shit in bed?
I've only slept with four blokes.

366
00:26:53,635 --> 00:26:55,554
Seriously?

367
00:26:55,555 --> 00:26:57,474
Yeah!

368
00:26:57,475 --> 00:27:01,114
You're practically a virgin.
Hey, I respect that!

369
00:27:01,115 --> 00:27:05,114
This pill's doing something
weird to my power, making me
say what's in my head.

370
00:27:05,275 --> 00:27:08,154
Sometimes, I think I fucking
love you.

371
00:27:08,155 --> 00:27:11,714
It's not me.It scares me, cos
I know you'll end up hurting me,

372
00:27:11,715 --> 00:27:15,554
like most blokes do, cos you're
a useless prick, just like your dad.

373
00:27:15,555 --> 00:27:19,554
I did eeny, meeny, miny, moe,
and you lost, and I still chose you!

374
00:27:20,235 --> 00:27:24,234
But now I'm changing my mind.
Jamie can have you, and I'm having...

375
00:27:24,875 --> 00:27:27,874
..the pretty one!

376
00:27:27,875 --> 00:27:31,874
Nathan?

377
00:27:52,155 --> 00:27:56,154
Get off me, you skanky bitch!

378
00:27:57,435 --> 00:27:59,794
(MAN) Oi, you skank!
(2ND MAN) Filthy bitch!

379
00:27:59,795 --> 00:28:03,794
(WOMAN) You minger!
(MAN) Dirty little skank!

380
00:28:06,155 --> 00:28:10,154
(GASPS)

381
00:28:20,635 --> 00:28:23,394
Hey.

382
00:28:23,395 --> 00:28:27,274
I was just thinking about you.

383
00:28:27,275 --> 00:28:29,594
What're you doing?

384
00:28:29,595 --> 00:28:32,994
I don't want to get
come on my dress.

385
00:28:32,995 --> 00:28:36,994
It's dry clean only.

386
00:28:46,155 --> 00:28:49,634
No...

387
00:28:49,635 --> 00:28:51,274
I can't do this.

388
00:28:51,275 --> 00:28:55,274
What?

389
00:28:58,915 --> 00:29:02,474
(GASPS)

390
00:29:02,475 --> 00:29:06,474
Alisha!

391
00:29:15,755 --> 00:29:19,354
You're fucking amazing!

392
00:29:19,355 --> 00:29:23,354
Dance with me.

393
00:30:01,475 --> 00:30:04,834
Fuck!

394
00:30:04,835 --> 00:30:08,834
Fella in the next cubicle.
You got any toilet roll in there?

395
00:30:09,115 --> 00:30:11,234
Nathan? It's me.

396
00:30:11,235 --> 00:30:15,234
Barry? Hey, man.
Help me out!

397
00:30:16,355 --> 00:30:19,474
Something weird's happening.
Everyone's looking at me.

398
00:30:19,475 --> 00:30:23,474
That'll be the pills. Kelly said
it did something to her powers.

399
00:30:24,035 --> 00:30:25,674
I didn't take one.

400
00:30:25,675 --> 00:30:28,994
I think my brother
may have spiked you.

401
00:30:28,995 --> 00:30:30,514
Well, I know he did.

402
00:30:30,515 --> 00:30:33,874
When you say everyone
was looking at you...

403
00:30:33,875 --> 00:30:36,834
..do you mean girls?

404
00:30:36,835 --> 00:30:40,794
Everyone. It's like
it's reversed my power.

405
00:30:40,795 --> 00:30:44,794
Want my advice? Find a nice,
sweet, innocent girl
and take advantage of her

406
00:30:45,235 --> 00:30:47,274
I can't use a power like that.

407
00:30:47,275 --> 00:30:51,274
I really don't see it
happening for you otherwise.

408
00:30:51,435 --> 00:30:54,074
Maybe we need to build up
your confidence first.

409
00:30:54,075 --> 00:30:57,754
Let's get you a prostitute.
There's a girl on the estate, right.

410
00:30:57,755 --> 00:31:01,714
She's not all that looks wise, not
since the accident, but looks clean.

411
00:31:01,715 --> 00:31:04,354
Clean enough for what you want.

412
00:31:04,355 --> 00:31:06,594
TOILET FLUSHES
Have you seen Lily?

413
00:31:06,595 --> 00:31:09,434
I think she went
outside with Jamie.

414
00:31:09,435 --> 00:31:12,354
That's supposed to be me
getting into her knickers!

415
00:31:12,355 --> 00:31:13,554
Nathan...

416
00:31:13,555 --> 00:31:16,674
Make sure you don't get killed.

417
00:31:16,675 --> 00:31:20,674
Nathan?!

418
00:31:50,315 --> 00:31:54,314
I feel really weird!

419
00:31:55,075 --> 00:31:57,394
I'm burning up!

420
00:31:57,395 --> 00:31:58,154
I'm so hot!

421
00:31:58,155 --> 00:31:59,674
I'm so hot!
Let me have a look at you.

422
00:31:59,675 --> 00:32:01,554
(PANTS)

423
00:32:01,555 --> 00:32:05,074
You're fine.

424
00:32:05,075 --> 00:32:09,074
You're beautiful.

425
00:32:19,155 --> 00:32:23,154
Oh...ah...

426
00:32:23,315 --> 00:32:27,314
LAUGHTER AND CHATTER

427
00:32:37,875 --> 00:32:40,154
(GROANING)

428
00:32:40,155 --> 00:32:44,154
(PANTING)

429
00:32:48,475 --> 00:32:52,474
Get off me!

430
00:32:58,435 --> 00:33:02,434
Jamie! Jamie!

431
00:33:02,875 --> 00:33:05,714
Jamie!

432
00:33:05,715 --> 00:33:07,074
Get off me!

433
00:33:07,075 --> 00:33:11,074
My brother's in there!
My brother's in there!

434
00:33:11,875 --> 00:33:14,834
Jamie!

435
00:33:14,835 --> 00:33:16,434
Jamie!

436
00:33:16,435 --> 00:33:20,434
(VOICE BREAKS) Jamie!
Jamie!

437
00:33:21,475 --> 00:33:23,154
Jamie!

438
00:33:23,155 --> 00:33:25,074
Oh...

439
00:33:25,075 --> 00:33:29,074
I thought you were dead,
you stupid bastard!

440
00:35:56,172 --> 00:36:00,011
She just started freaking out.

441
00:36:00,012 --> 00:36:03,491
Then she threw me out of the car.

442
00:36:03,492 --> 00:36:06,211
She's dead, man.

443
00:36:06,212 --> 00:36:07,971
There was nothing I could do.

444
00:36:07,972 --> 00:36:11,971
This isn't down to you.
This is just one of those...

445
00:36:12,372 --> 00:36:14,371
..just totally fucked-up situations.

446
00:36:14,372 --> 00:36:16,851
Who knew that would happen? >

447
00:36:16,852 --> 00:36:20,571
What's with her bursting into
flames like that? That's not normal.

448
00:36:20,572 --> 00:36:22,211
Yeah, there was a storm. >

449
00:36:22,212 --> 00:36:25,371
Bunch of us got superpowers.

450
00:36:25,372 --> 00:36:29,011
I'm immortal.

451
00:36:29,012 --> 00:36:32,211
Big reveal.

452
00:36:32,212 --> 00:36:33,251
Seriously?

453
00:36:33,252 --> 00:36:36,491
Yeah.

454
00:36:36,492 --> 00:36:40,491
Oh, I feel like shit.

455
00:36:41,852 --> 00:36:43,971
I've been thinking.

456
00:36:43,972 --> 00:36:46,251
You were right.

457
00:36:46,252 --> 00:36:49,371
I should try and
sort things out with Dad.

458
00:36:49,372 --> 00:36:50,971
Will you come and see him with me?

459
00:36:50,972 --> 00:36:54,051
I can't see that helping anybody,

460
00:36:54,052 --> 00:36:56,451
least of all me.

461
00:36:56,452 --> 00:36:58,611
You'll be fine.
You'll get on with him.

462
00:36:58,612 --> 00:37:01,691
I hit him with a toaster and
locked him in the boot of my car.

463
00:37:01,692 --> 00:37:04,331
OK, yeah, so it's going to
be a bit awkward at first.

464
00:37:04,332 --> 00:37:06,211
We've all been there.

465
00:37:06,212 --> 00:37:09,211
Well, maybe not there,
but somewhere similar.

466
00:37:09,212 --> 00:37:11,571
Just gloss over it.

467
00:37:11,572 --> 00:37:15,571
I don't know what to say to him.

468
00:37:16,772 --> 00:37:20,771
Come on, man. Do this one thing.
Come with me.

469
00:37:22,932 --> 00:37:26,931
No.

470
00:37:27,412 --> 00:37:29,131
You know, the worst thing about it -

471
00:37:29,132 --> 00:37:31,491
it wasn't any different to
my normal power.

472
00:37:31,492 --> 00:37:33,091
Either way, I'm untouchable.

473
00:37:33,092 --> 00:37:37,451
Don't say that.
It's true.

474
00:37:37,452 --> 00:37:39,491
What did you see
when you went forward?

475
00:37:39,492 --> 00:37:43,491
I was standing on a roof,
like I was going to jump off it.

476
00:37:46,852 --> 00:37:49,851
I was just a superhero.

477
00:37:49,852 --> 00:37:51,971
You're saying you've
become a superhero?

478
00:37:51,972 --> 00:37:55,011
Dunno.

479
00:37:55,012 --> 00:37:59,011
Then what happened?

480
00:37:59,612 --> 00:38:03,611
Nothing.

481
00:38:28,852 --> 00:38:29,891
Ow!

482
00:38:29,892 --> 00:38:33,891
Fucker.

483
00:38:46,532 --> 00:38:48,251
Why did you hit me?

484
00:38:48,252 --> 00:38:52,171
Cos I panicked.
Don't make a big deal out of it.

485
00:38:52,172 --> 00:38:54,771
Tell him.

486
00:38:54,772 --> 00:38:56,451
OK, look.

487
00:38:56,452 --> 00:38:59,291
I know it's too late for me and you.
I get that.

488
00:38:59,292 --> 00:39:01,091
I've known you didn't give a shit

489
00:39:01,092 --> 00:39:03,371
ever since you left me in IKEA
with that paedophile.

490
00:39:03,372 --> 00:39:04,931
What paedophile?

491
00:39:04,932 --> 00:39:07,171
My eighth birthday. IKEA!

492
00:39:07,172 --> 00:39:09,611
The guy with the Swedish meatballs?

493
00:39:09,612 --> 00:39:11,051
I don't remember that.

494
00:39:11,052 --> 00:39:12,851
How very convenient.

495
00:39:12,852 --> 00:39:15,211
Is this about the guy
who was seeing your mum

496
00:39:15,212 --> 00:39:17,651
who you said was trying to
sexually abuse you?

497
00:39:17,652 --> 00:39:20,051
No, I made that up!
This is something else.

498
00:39:20,052 --> 00:39:21,611
IKEA paedophile!

499
00:39:21,612 --> 00:39:24,011
Jesus, meatballs!

500
00:39:24,012 --> 00:39:28,011
This isn't about who was or who
wasn't trying to sexually abuse me.

501
00:39:28,372 --> 00:39:30,331
It's about you and Jamie.

502
00:39:30,332 --> 00:39:33,091
So I'm pretty much
a complete write-off. That's fine.

503
00:39:33,092 --> 00:39:33,491
Nathan...

504
00:39:33,492 --> 00:39:35,691
Nathan...
Whatever.
And so he hit you with a toaster

505
00:39:35,692 --> 00:39:39,691
and kidnapped you, but you know what
they say? Don't fuck a wounded bear!

506
00:39:49,252 --> 00:39:53,251
Jamie's dead.

507
00:39:53,612 --> 00:39:56,211
He's standing right there.

508
00:39:56,212 --> 00:39:59,691
What?

509
00:39:59,692 --> 00:40:03,691
It caught fire.

510
00:40:05,892 --> 00:40:09,891
I've just had to go
and identify his body.

511
00:40:13,292 --> 00:40:17,291
MOBILE BUZZES

512
00:40:17,292 --> 00:40:21,291
This is his mother.
I've got to talk to her.

513
00:40:23,852 --> 00:40:27,851
Hi.

514
00:40:30,452 --> 00:40:31,971
You're dead?

515
00:40:31,972 --> 00:40:35,971
Yeah.

516
00:40:45,932 --> 00:40:48,091
So how come I can see you?

517
00:40:48,092 --> 00:40:52,091
I guess it's cos you're immortal.

518
00:40:53,852 --> 00:40:56,731
No, this isn't happening. No.

519
00:40:56,732 --> 00:40:59,571
I can fix this.
How do I fix this?

520
00:40:59,572 --> 00:41:00,531
You can't.

521
00:41:00,532 --> 00:41:03,371
You can't.
I don't want you to die, mate.

522
00:41:03,372 --> 00:41:06,451
It wasn't down to you...

523
00:41:06,452 --> 00:41:08,771
..so don't go all mental about it.

524
00:41:08,772 --> 00:41:12,771
To be honest, it's not so bad.

525
00:41:13,612 --> 00:41:17,611
So if you're dead,
what am I doing here, exactly?

526
00:41:18,292 --> 00:41:22,291
I wanted you to
sort things out with Dad.

527
00:41:24,932 --> 00:41:28,691
Look, no offence, but I think it's
going to take more than you dying

528
00:41:28,692 --> 00:41:31,171
to fix years of resentment,
missed birthdays

529
00:41:31,172 --> 00:41:35,171
and all that dysfunctional bullshit,
but it was a lovely thought(!)

530
00:41:36,172 --> 00:41:40,171
(SNIFFLES)

531
00:41:43,932 --> 00:41:47,931
Look at him.

532
00:42:02,612 --> 00:42:06,611
I went to the hospital
when Jamie was born.

533
00:42:07,652 --> 00:42:11,651
His mum was asleep.

534
00:42:12,852 --> 00:42:16,851
I was just standing there,
looking down at him.

535
00:42:19,212 --> 00:42:22,291
I thought I had to choose.

536
00:42:22,292 --> 00:42:26,291
I chose you and your mum. >

537
00:42:31,252 --> 00:42:35,251
They didn't even know I was there.

538
00:42:38,452 --> 00:42:42,451
I thought I was
doing the right thing.

539
00:42:46,452 --> 00:42:48,931
I wasn't there for either of you.

540
00:42:48,932 --> 00:42:52,931
I was a selfish prick.

541
00:42:55,852 --> 00:42:59,851
I'm sorry, Nathan.

542
00:43:03,172 --> 00:43:06,771
You want this, so don't be a dick.

543
00:43:06,772 --> 00:43:12,691
I will haunt you
for the rest of your life.
All right!

544
00:43:18,092 --> 00:43:22,091
I'm starving.

545
00:43:26,172 --> 00:43:30,171
Do you want to buy me breakfast
or not?

546
00:43:33,812 --> 00:43:37,811
Yeah, OK. OK.

547
00:43:42,372 --> 00:43:44,211
So, can I drive?

548
00:43:44,212 --> 00:43:45,891
Have you passed your test?

549
00:43:45,892 --> 00:43:48,011
Have I passed my test?!
I give the tests!

550
00:43:48,012 --> 00:43:49,411
So you haven't.

551
00:43:49,412 --> 00:43:53,411
No.

552
00:44:04,412 --> 00:44:08,411
(I'm fucking her).

553
00:44:12,252 --> 00:44:15,491
What?

554
00:44:15,492 --> 00:44:19,491
Nothing.

555
00:44:36,212 --> 00:44:37,251
Hey.

556
00:44:37,252 --> 00:44:40,891
Where've you been?

557
00:44:40,892 --> 00:44:44,291
You know, just hanging out
with my dead brother.

558
00:44:44,292 --> 00:44:45,571
What are you talking about?

559
00:44:45,572 --> 00:44:49,131
I see dead people.

560
00:44:49,132 --> 00:44:53,131
So there's a thing.

561
00:44:54,372 --> 00:44:58,371
I'm sorry to hear about Jamie, yeah?

562
00:45:01,212 --> 00:45:05,211
You were there for him.

563
00:45:11,332 --> 00:45:13,131
(CLEARS THROAT) >

564
00:45:13,132 --> 00:45:14,371
The guy in the mask.

565
00:45:14,372 --> 00:45:17,011
I followed him.
I know where he lives. >

566
00:45:17,012 --> 00:45:19,811
Yeah?
What do you want us to do about it?

567
00:45:19,812 --> 00:45:23,811
I think we should go
round there and talk to him.

568
00:45:33,652 --> 00:45:37,651
This is it.

569
00:45:42,492 --> 00:45:46,491
So what do we do now?

570
00:45:48,492 --> 00:45:49,411
Jesus!

571
00:45:49,412 --> 00:45:51,131
Jesus!
Oh, subtle(!)

572
00:45:51,132 --> 00:45:55,131
I'm sure no-one heard that.

573
00:46:09,332 --> 00:46:10,811
This is a girl's bedroom.

574
00:46:10,812 --> 00:46:13,971
So now we're saying
he's a cross-dresser?

575
00:46:13,972 --> 00:46:15,531
Something's wrong.

576
00:46:15,532 --> 00:46:17,891
I'm going to take a shit in his bed.

577
00:46:17,892 --> 00:46:18,531
What?!

578
00:46:18,532 --> 00:46:20,691
What?!
I don't think you should do that.

579
00:46:20,692 --> 00:46:24,051
We need to send a message.
Let him know he can't fuck with us.

580
00:46:24,052 --> 00:46:26,371
How does taking a shit
in his bed do that?

581
00:46:26,372 --> 00:46:27,891
They did it in The Godfather.

582
00:46:27,892 --> 00:46:30,691
They put a horse's head in the bed.

583
00:46:30,692 --> 00:46:34,691
Well, have you got a horse's head?

584
00:46:51,452 --> 00:46:53,131
This isn't his flat.

585
00:46:53,132 --> 00:46:54,611
So why did he lead us here?

586
00:46:54,612 --> 00:46:57,451
Maybe he knew I was following him.

587
00:46:57,452 --> 00:47:01,451
I'm done.

588
00:47:04,332 --> 00:47:05,891
Who are you?

589
00:47:05,892 --> 00:47:07,651
Why are you in my flat?

590
00:47:07,652 --> 00:47:09,131
It's you.

591
00:47:09,132 --> 00:47:13,131
Someone grab me some toilet paper?

592
00:47:15,772 --> 00:47:17,651
'I love him.'

593
00:47:17,652 --> 00:47:19,651
Are you telling me you're gay?

594
00:47:19,652 --> 00:47:22,811
Gay, straight, retarded,
why do we have to label everything?

595
00:47:22,812 --> 00:47:24,571
I feel like I know you.

596
00:47:24,572 --> 00:47:28,571
You can help yourself.

597
00:47:29,772 --> 00:47:33,771
You're...touching me.
Who are you?

598
00:48:08,052 --> 00:48:12,051
