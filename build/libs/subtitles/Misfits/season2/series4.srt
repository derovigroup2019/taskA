1
00:00:02,680 --> 00:00:04,679
What the fuck is going on?

2
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:07,519
Since when did you run around
jumping off buildings?

3
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:09,559
Since I travelled back
from the future.

4
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:11,159
So what happens now?

5
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:13,039
You fall in love with me.

6
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:14,159
Am I going to die?

7
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:15,759
I'm not going to let that happen.

8
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:18,079
You can never tell Simon I'm him.

9
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:20,039
Is this doing anything for you?

10
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:21,879
I'm a guy, we're not that fussy.

11
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:23,799
I just think we should be mates.

12
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:25,119
You OK?

13
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:27,079
Brilliant.

14
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:28,439
Can I do anything, like?

15
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:29,879
You got a spare heart?

16
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:33,879
What?

17
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:02,599
What you doing?

18
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:06,119
Nothing.

19
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:09,279
Well, if you're done
being all superheroey,

20
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:13,279
with your little clocks,
you can come back to bed.

21
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:36,839
# War, huh, yeah

22
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:39,159
# What is it good for?

23
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:42,479
# Absolutely nothing
Uh-huh, oh

24
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:46,119
# War, huh, yeah

25
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:47,799
# What is it good for?

26
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:49,559
# Absolutely nothing

27
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:51,199
# Say it again, y'all

28
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:55,199
# War, huh, huh,look out... #

29
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:09,119
Hey.

30
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:11,199
Who's the new guy?

31
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:13,919
What's your name again?

32
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,439
It's Ollie.

33
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:19,159
Right. These are
some other young offenders.

34
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:23,159
He's going to be doing his Community
Service thing with you lot.

35
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,879
Are you saying he's like
a new member of the gang?

36
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:27,919
Whatever.

37
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:31,919
Look, piss off
and pick up some litter.

38
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:41,079
Hi.

39
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,519
# The city breathing

40
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:58,199
# The people churning

41
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:59,679
# The conversating

42
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:03,679
# The price is what?

43
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:17,999
# The conversating

44
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,879
# This place is heaven

45
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:21,679
# And if you see them... #

46
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:24,719
Whatever happens, we can't let the
new guy find out about our powers.

47
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:26,359
What do we do if he does find out?

48
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:29,119
We kill him.

49
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:31,639
I'm joking.

50
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:34,519
You're making jokes now? 
Excuse us.

51
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:37,039
You're creeping out of
your weird little shell.

52
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:41,039
I get that. Good for you.
But let's get one thing straight,
I'm the funny guy round here.

53
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:46,919
He's coming.

54
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,599
All right?

55
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:51,079
What did you get done for?

56
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:55,039
I was arrested for vandalising
a coal-fired power station.

57
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:57,759
We were protesting
against CO2 emissions.

58
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:01,759
DISINTERESTED GROAN

59
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:11,639
Have any of you got
one of these weird powers?

60
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:12,879
What? What powers?

61
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:15,159
I was only asking
because I've got one.

62
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:18,159
Oh, yeah, us too.

63
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:21,319
I don't think I was supposed
to tell you that.

64
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:23,359
What can you do?

65
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:25,879
I can teleport.

66
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:29,879
Let's see you do it then.

67
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:47,239
Whoa!

68
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:50,599
Ahem. 

69
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:53,399
That's shit.
You could've walked there quicker.

70
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:55,399
Sometimes I go further than that.

71
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:57,399
That's really impressive.

72
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:01,399
I honestly thought something more
exciting was going to happen.

73
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,199
This is great.

74
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:20,879
So are we all right?

75
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:23,279
You know,
what with me slipping you a finger?

76
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:27,279
I don't even want to
think about it, all right?

77
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:33,519
Does all this get recycled?

78
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,719
What's with this guy?

79
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:39,719
He's fucking crazy!

80
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:47,159
Oh. Do you think he was
talking about this fella?

81
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:02,439
Where's Conti?

82
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:04,239
Oh, it's him.

83
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:08,239
He's a right Conti.

84
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:18,719
Did you think I was going to let
it go? I want my money.

85
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:22,199
Give the man his money.

86
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:26,199
I haven't got your money.

87
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:33,079
Roxy?

88
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:37,559
So you're with him now?

89
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:40,999
I was still waiting for you at the
church when the cops picked me up.

90
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,519
Not being funny, mate, but
you're acting like a right nutter.

91
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:46,959
He's clearly suffering from
a mental illness.

92
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:49,039
I want my money.

93
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:50,679
Let me talk to him.

94
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:52,239
Don't, look, just leave it.

95
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:53,439
It's OK.

96
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:56,319
I've had some training
in conflict resolution.

97
00:06:56,320 --> 00:07:00,319
This should be entertaining.

98
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:03,879
What's your name?

99
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:05,479
It's OK.

100
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:09,479
I'm not going to hurt you...

101
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:17,559
Run!
Run!

102
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:18,319
Run!
Oh, fuck's sake!

103
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:22,319
Fuck!

104
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:02,759
He shot him. He shot the new guy.

105
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:04,479
We should go back for him.

106
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:05,839
He was hit in the head.

107
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:08,599
He's fucked.

108
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:12,599
Hey, no. It's OK.
He's fine. He's over there.

109
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:17,919
I don't see him.

110
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:19,479
What?

111
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:23,479
Oh, then that must be his ghost,
which means he's not at all OK,

112
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:27,239
on account of him being dead.

113
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,799
This is messed up.

114
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:31,279
Hey! Hey, hey, hey, new guy!

115
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:34,679
Sorry you got shot, man.

116
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:35,959
Hey, fuck you!

117
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:36,999
What was that?

118
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,319
He just got shot
and you're insulting him?

119
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:40,759
He made an obscene gesture.

120
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:44,719
I don't care if he's dead.
There's no excuse for rudeness.

121
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,239
You should rewind time.

122
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:48,399
You can save him.

123
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:52,399
Go on, then.

124
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:03,359
Well, I didn't know him.

125
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:04,959
I'm not feeling it.

126
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:07,479
Yeah, he was a bit of a twat.

127
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:09,319
There's something wrong with you.

128
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:12,119
Come on, seriously?
He was never going to fit in,

129
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:16,119
what with all the caring
about the environment and
that. Better him than me.

130
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:18,199
You're immortal.

131
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:22,199
Better him, than one of you.

132
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,999
# Think of your fellow man
Lend them a helping hand

133
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:35,479
# Put a little love in your heart

134
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:40,239
# You see it's getting late
Oh, please don't hesitate

135
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:45,559
# To put a little love
into your heart

136
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:49,559
# And the world, the world,
would be a better place

137
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:54,679
# Oh, and the world, the world,
would be a better place

138
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:58,799
# For you

139
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:01,359
# And just for me, and me

140
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:03,599
# You just wait, just wait

141
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:07,319
#And see

142
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:11,319
# Another day goes by
Still the children cry

143
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:16,559
# Put a little love into your heart

144
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:21,239
# If you want the world to know... #

145
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:29,039
You knew?

146
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:31,679
You knew it was going to happen?

147
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:34,319
Why didn't you stop it?

148
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,399
I can't save everyone.

149
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:39,519
That's bullshit.

150
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:43,279
If I'd have stopped
it from happening,

151
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:47,279
someone else would've died.

152
00:11:02,110 --> 00:11:05,549
The police want witness
statements off all of you.

153
00:11:05,550 --> 00:11:08,469
And try not to screw it up cos
I don't need them on my back.

154
00:11:08,470 --> 00:11:12,389
Think you can manage that?

155
00:11:12,390 --> 00:11:14,189
Good.

156
00:11:14,190 --> 00:11:15,189
Is that it?

157
00:11:15,190 --> 00:11:18,029
Aren't you going to even
pretend to be a little bit sad?

158
00:11:18,030 --> 00:11:19,749
Do you know how much

159
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:23,749
paperwork's involved when someone
gets shot doing community service?

160
00:11:24,070 --> 00:11:27,269
I've got health and safety
forms coming out of my arse.

161
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:29,349
So sure,

162
00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:33,349
we're all very sad! So there it is.

163
00:11:33,990 --> 00:11:37,989
It's a cruel, senseless waste.

164
00:11:38,950 --> 00:11:40,509
A young man...

165
00:11:40,510 --> 00:11:44,469
taken from us in his prime,
leaving us to pick up the pieces

166
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:46,189
of our shattered lives,

167
00:11:46,190 --> 00:11:50,149
knowing that he's gone forever.

168
00:11:50,150 --> 00:11:51,709
So, maybe

169
00:11:51,710 --> 00:11:54,189
we should have the
rest of the week off,

170
00:11:54,190 --> 00:11:58,189
you know, to cry and grieve,
and remember our dear friend...

171
00:12:06,150 --> 00:12:10,909
Ollie.
Ollie! Dear, beautiful Ollie.

172
00:12:13,150 --> 00:12:16,509
Heartless bastard.

173
00:12:16,510 --> 00:12:20,509
We should do something...

174
00:12:21,270 --> 00:12:23,669
..about the guy who shot Ollie.

175
00:12:23,670 --> 00:12:27,669
So, you're talking about stepping
up to the plate and taking him down?

176
00:12:28,470 --> 00:12:30,429
I really don't see that happening.

177
00:12:30,430 --> 00:12:30,949
He's right.

178
00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:33,429
He's right.
Since when did you want to get
involved in anything like this?

179
00:12:33,430 --> 00:12:37,269
Maybe since I got someone's
brains blown out all over my face.

180
00:12:37,270 --> 00:12:38,589
If we go up against him,

181
00:12:38,590 --> 00:12:40,589
one of us is going to get our
brains blown out.

182
00:12:40,590 --> 00:12:42,429
We can't just pretend
it didn't happen.

183
00:12:42,430 --> 00:12:44,549
I do that all the time.

184
00:12:44,550 --> 00:12:47,709
It's like that fella in the Bible -
the Good Samaritan.

185
00:12:47,710 --> 00:12:50,269
Walk on by.

186
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:52,549
So, how are you going to feel if

187
00:12:52,550 --> 00:12:56,549
we do nothing and we read in the
paper that he shot someone else?

188
00:12:57,070 --> 00:12:59,389
I don't read the papers.

189
00:12:59,390 --> 00:13:01,029
All right.
So what're you two going to

190
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:05,029
do when you find this guy and
he sticks a gun to your head?

191
00:13:05,710 --> 00:13:09,709
I'm glad you've got it all figured
out. No way you're getting involved.

192
00:13:10,110 --> 00:13:12,629
Since when did you tell
me what I can and can't do?

193
00:13:12,630 --> 00:13:16,189
Since I care about whether you die
or not. You forgotten about that?

194
00:13:16,190 --> 00:13:17,909
Guys. Come on. Seriously.

195
00:13:17,910 --> 00:13:21,869
I think I speak for all of us when
I say we're lazy and incompetent.

196
00:13:21,870 --> 00:13:24,109
We're practically handicapped.

197
00:13:24,110 --> 00:13:27,549
Leave it to the police.
They get paid to get shot.

198
00:13:27,550 --> 00:13:31,029
I never thought I'd say this but
he's talking sense.

199
00:13:31,030 --> 00:13:35,029
Thank you. Hey! I'm already
doing my bit to fight crime. Bosh!

200
00:13:46,950 --> 00:13:49,869
It feels weird

201
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:52,509
that's someone else's heart...

202
00:13:52,510 --> 00:13:56,509
It will feel strange
for a little while.

203
00:13:57,430 --> 00:14:01,429
You're making the most
remarkable recovery.

204
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:06,469
How does it work? Am I supposed to

205
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:09,949
send a card to his parents?
"Thanks for the heart."

206
00:14:09,950 --> 00:14:12,189
Would you like me to see if the
next of kin are happy

207
00:14:12,190 --> 00:14:16,189
for their details to be passed
on to you?

208
00:14:17,310 --> 00:14:21,309
Yeah... OK.

209
00:14:38,470 --> 00:14:40,789
BEEPING

210
00:14:40,790 --> 00:14:44,789
SHE BREATHES HEAVILY

211
00:15:18,230 --> 00:15:22,149
I can't even go back and save
someone who's just been shot.

212
00:15:22,150 --> 00:15:26,149
What's that about?

213
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:29,949
Am I boring you?

214
00:15:29,950 --> 00:15:31,549
I'm just checking the time.

215
00:15:31,550 --> 00:15:34,469
Because you're bored?
No. Because I'm having
the time of my life!

216
00:15:34,470 --> 00:15:37,109
What's going on with you?
Nothing.

217
00:15:37,110 --> 00:15:38,349
It seems like there is.

218
00:15:38,350 --> 00:15:39,949
Just leave it, all right?

219
00:15:39,950 --> 00:15:43,469
Get down!

220
00:15:43,470 --> 00:15:44,789
Did he see us?

221
00:15:44,790 --> 00:15:48,789
I don't think so.

222
00:15:50,070 --> 00:15:51,309
Shit! What's he doing?

223
00:15:51,310 --> 00:15:54,709
I don't know.

224
00:15:54,710 --> 00:15:58,709
Conti!

225
00:15:59,350 --> 00:16:01,629
I knew we needed to do
something about him.

226
00:16:01,630 --> 00:16:03,469
So this is my fault? 
That figures.

227
00:16:03,470 --> 00:16:06,509
I didn't say it was your fault.
You're not listening to me.

228
00:16:06,510 --> 00:16:09,069
Most the time you've got
nothing to say any more.
Oh, fuck off!

229
00:16:09,070 --> 00:16:13,069
You fuck off! I'm done with you.

230
00:16:18,430 --> 00:16:22,429
Oh, shit! Go!

231
00:16:29,430 --> 00:16:30,829
Are you finishing with me?

232
00:16:30,830 --> 00:16:32,069
Do we have to do this right now?

233
00:16:32,070 --> 00:16:35,309
Do we have to do this right now?
Yes.

234
00:16:35,310 --> 00:16:37,309
Things with us...

235
00:16:37,310 --> 00:16:39,669
They haven't been
right for a while now.

236
00:16:39,670 --> 00:16:41,509
You're different.

237
00:16:41,510 --> 00:16:45,509
You've changed.

238
00:16:46,150 --> 00:16:50,149
We need to move. Come on!

239
00:17:21,030 --> 00:17:25,029
So, I guess that's it.

240
00:17:27,670 --> 00:17:30,109
I never wanted it to end like this.

241
00:17:30,110 --> 00:17:32,549
Something's not right.

242
00:17:32,550 --> 00:17:34,269
Maybe I fucked it up.

243
00:17:34,270 --> 00:17:35,309
No.

244
00:17:35,310 --> 00:17:39,309
It's me.

245
00:17:40,110 --> 00:17:44,109
I'm sorry.

246
00:17:45,590 --> 00:17:48,669
'There's something going on
with this heart you put in me.'

247
00:17:48,670 --> 00:17:50,349
There's something wrong with it.

248
00:17:50,350 --> 00:17:53,069
I promise you.
There is nothing wrong with it.

249
00:17:53,070 --> 00:17:55,429
Take it out. I want a different one.

250
00:17:55,430 --> 00:17:57,669
We don't have spares
just lying around.

251
00:17:57,670 --> 00:18:00,109
People die all the time.

252
00:18:00,110 --> 00:18:01,749
Look at him!

253
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:05,749
He doesn't look like he's got
long to go. I'll have his heart.

254
00:18:08,550 --> 00:18:12,469
When a patient makes a
miraculous recovery,

255
00:18:12,470 --> 00:18:14,109
we don't hold a big inquest.

256
00:18:14,110 --> 00:18:18,109
We treat sick people,
and you're not sick any more.

257
00:18:21,550 --> 00:18:25,549
Job done!

258
00:18:34,830 --> 00:18:37,269
I did what you said.

259
00:18:37,270 --> 00:18:41,269
I let it play out.

260
00:18:41,990 --> 00:18:45,989
Me and Curtis...

261
00:18:46,550 --> 00:18:50,549
We're over.

262
00:19:18,110 --> 00:19:22,109
Hi!

263
00:19:23,470 --> 00:19:25,669
Hi.

264
00:19:25,670 --> 00:19:27,149
Did you know him?

265
00:19:27,150 --> 00:19:29,749
I've got his heart.

266
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:31,789
What do you mean?

267
00:19:31,790 --> 00:19:34,749
I mean, when he died, they ripped
his heart out and stuck it in me.

268
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:38,749
Bullshit!

269
00:19:45,910 --> 00:19:49,149
You OK?

270
00:19:49,150 --> 00:19:53,149
Something weird's happening to me.

271
00:19:57,710 --> 00:20:01,709
Seriously?

272
00:20:03,790 --> 00:20:05,709
I can teleport.

273
00:20:05,710 --> 00:20:08,629
I suppose that could be useful.

274
00:20:08,630 --> 00:20:12,629
Beats getting the bus.

275
00:20:14,870 --> 00:20:18,029
Thanks for the pyjamas.

276
00:20:18,030 --> 00:20:21,829
Hope they fit.
I had to guess your size.

277
00:20:21,830 --> 00:20:25,829
Always a nightmare.

278
00:20:27,710 --> 00:20:29,429
I should go.

279
00:20:29,430 --> 00:20:30,909
What, are you going?

280
00:20:30,910 --> 00:20:33,029
Got my community service.

281
00:20:33,030 --> 00:20:37,029
Er, you just told me I've inherited
the power to teleport from the guy

282
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:41,229
whose heart was transplanted into me
and now you're going to walk off and

283
00:20:41,230 --> 00:20:45,029
leave it at that.
Well, fuck you very much!

284
00:20:45,030 --> 00:20:47,629
How do you want to leave it?

285
00:20:47,630 --> 00:20:51,629
Well, the least you could do
is ask me out for a drink.

286
00:21:07,110 --> 00:21:08,989
We should go away somewhere.

287
00:21:08,990 --> 00:21:12,989
Where would you like to go?

288
00:21:13,430 --> 00:21:16,709
I've always wanted
to go to Las Vegas.

289
00:21:16,710 --> 00:21:18,869
I'll take you there.

290
00:21:18,870 --> 00:21:22,869
I promise.

291
00:21:32,310 --> 00:21:36,309
I've got something for you.

292
00:21:37,950 --> 00:21:41,949
No-one's ever given
me keys to their place before.

293
00:21:45,430 --> 00:21:49,429
Now you can let yourself in.

294
00:21:56,470 --> 00:22:00,069
I've got to go.

295
00:22:00,070 --> 00:22:03,309
What?

296
00:22:03,310 --> 00:22:05,949
Nothing.

297
00:22:05,950 --> 00:22:09,949
All right, mystery man.

298
00:22:13,350 --> 00:22:17,349
I'm going to be late.

299
00:22:39,124 --> 00:22:43,123
Aggh!

300
00:22:51,084 --> 00:22:53,723
Alisha?

301
00:22:53,724 --> 00:22:57,723
Hiya.

302
00:22:59,284 --> 00:23:02,683
MUSIC POUNDS

303
00:23:02,684 --> 00:23:06,683
Look, before you hear me thinking
it, I'll just tell you, yeah?

304
00:23:08,284 --> 00:23:12,283
Me and Curtis ended it last night.

305
00:23:12,924 --> 00:23:15,683
You all right?

306
00:23:15,684 --> 00:23:17,283
Yeah, I'm...I'm fine.

307
00:23:17,284 --> 00:23:21,283
If that was me, I'd be, like,
all crying my eyes out and shit.

308
00:23:24,644 --> 00:23:25,203
Run!

309
00:23:25,204 --> 00:23:29,203
Run!
Oh, fuck!

310
00:23:48,484 --> 00:23:52,443
TYRES SCREECH

311
00:23:52,444 --> 00:23:56,443
Alisha!

312
00:24:13,364 --> 00:24:15,643
Kelly!

313
00:24:15,644 --> 00:24:19,003
Kelly! Let her go!

314
00:24:19,004 --> 00:24:21,403
You tell Conti,

315
00:24:21,404 --> 00:24:22,923
I want my money.

316
00:24:22,924 --> 00:24:25,603
There is no Conti!
There's no Conti!

317
00:24:25,604 --> 00:24:27,403
There's no money,
 just let her go!

318
00:24:27,404 --> 00:24:31,403
Tell Conti to bring my hundred grand
to the warehouse on Tipton Street.

319
00:24:40,684 --> 00:24:44,603
Kelly!

320
00:24:44,604 --> 00:24:48,603
(Fuck!)

321
00:24:51,364 --> 00:24:52,923
The bloke who shot the new guy.

322
00:24:52,924 --> 00:24:56,483
He was on the estate again last
night. He's looking for this Conti.

323
00:24:56,484 --> 00:24:58,803
He thinks I'm Conti.

324
00:24:58,804 --> 00:25:00,083
Why does he think that?

325
00:25:00,084 --> 00:25:05,163
Because you told him I was.
Did I? Sorry, man. I think they've mended it.

326
00:25:10,896 --> 00:25:12,815
You want me to buy you a drink?

327
00:25:12,816 --> 00:25:15,815
I have never paid for a drink
from this machine before

328
00:25:15,816 --> 00:25:19,815
and I don't intend to start now.

329
00:25:23,736 --> 00:25:27,735
Thank you!

330
00:25:31,776 --> 00:25:36,135
Well, the bad news is they've
fixed the vending machine.
The guy with the red car and the gun...

331
00:25:36,136 --> 00:25:38,815
We were just talking about him.
Yeah, he's got Kelly.

332
00:25:38,816 --> 00:25:42,095
Oh, Jesus. He's going to shoot her,
and he going to kill her.

333
00:25:42,096 --> 00:25:43,575
I told you he was dangerous.

334
00:25:43,576 --> 00:25:45,135
Right, everybody calm down!

335
00:25:45,136 --> 00:25:49,135
Just think. Think and keep calm.

336
00:25:51,016 --> 00:25:54,215
Do something, you little freak!

337
00:25:59,136 --> 00:26:03,135
He's here.

338
00:26:19,496 --> 00:26:20,815
(SCREAMS)

339
00:26:20,816 --> 00:26:24,815
Oh, Jesus. He's kicking the shit out
of her!

340
00:26:27,696 --> 00:26:31,695
(GRUNTS)

341
00:26:34,056 --> 00:26:35,415
Where's Conti?

342
00:26:35,416 --> 00:26:36,775
He's screwing your mama.

343
00:26:36,776 --> 00:26:40,775
GUNSHOT

344
00:26:43,936 --> 00:26:47,935
He's living the game.

345
00:26:48,176 --> 00:26:51,335
Where did all this come from?

346
00:26:51,336 --> 00:26:54,175
He was the guy in the mask.

347
00:26:54,176 --> 00:26:56,295
Give me my hundred grand.

348
00:26:56,296 --> 00:26:57,935
I haven't got your money, Jimmy.

349
00:26:57,936 --> 00:27:01,935
I haven't got your money, Jimmy.
(SLAP)

350
00:27:04,736 --> 00:27:06,775
That's far enough.

351
00:27:06,776 --> 00:27:08,775
Let me go, you dick.

352
00:27:08,776 --> 00:27:12,775
(PUNCH)

353
00:27:14,856 --> 00:27:18,855
Put it on.

354
00:27:19,136 --> 00:27:23,135
You can shove that up your arse.

355
00:27:24,616 --> 00:27:28,615
Put it on.

356
00:27:35,576 --> 00:27:36,615
He's Jimmy Cisco.

357
00:27:36,616 --> 00:27:39,335
He spent ten years
in prison for armed robbery.

358
00:27:39,336 --> 00:27:42,055
His lover and this crime boss,
Conti,

359
00:27:42,056 --> 00:27:45,815
they double-crossed him
on his wedding day.

360
00:27:45,816 --> 00:27:49,295
Hey, watch me run
over this fat bloke.

361
00:27:49,296 --> 00:27:52,615
Run, fat boy, run!

362
00:27:52,616 --> 00:27:56,615
Oh, he's fucked up my car!

363
00:27:57,496 --> 00:28:01,495
GUNSHOTS FROM GAME

364
00:28:02,936 --> 00:28:05,135
We need to play the game for real.

365
00:28:05,136 --> 00:28:08,655
If we give him his money,
I think he'll let Kelly go.

366
00:28:08,656 --> 00:28:12,655
So now all we need
is a hundred grand?

367
00:28:15,056 --> 00:28:18,015
We could a rob a bank.

368
00:28:19,176 --> 00:28:21,775
Yeah, OK. Let's rob a bank.

369
00:28:21,776 --> 00:28:24,175
What's that?

370
00:28:24,176 --> 00:28:25,455
Nothing.

371
00:28:25,456 --> 00:28:27,335
Really? That's funny, innit?

372
00:28:27,336 --> 00:28:30,735
Because to me it sounded like you
were planning on robbing a bank.

373
00:28:30,736 --> 00:28:34,735
No, no, no.
I said, er, "Let's have a big wank."

374
00:28:35,416 --> 00:28:39,415
Communal masturbation.
The old circle jerk.

375
00:28:41,456 --> 00:28:44,975
Go and clean my car.

376
00:28:44,976 --> 00:28:48,455
That wasn't what they had in mind
when we got community service.

377
00:28:48,456 --> 00:28:52,095
Well, I'm a member of the
community and my car needs cleaning.

378
00:28:52,096 --> 00:28:55,015
And I don't give a shit.

379
00:28:55,016 --> 00:28:58,335
The man wants his car washed.

380
00:28:58,336 --> 00:28:59,455
(MOUTHS) What?

381
00:28:59,456 --> 00:29:03,455
He's giving us his keys
so we can clean his car.

382
00:29:05,016 --> 00:29:09,015
For fuck's sake.

383
00:29:13,936 --> 00:29:15,495
We're stealing his car.

384
00:29:15,496 --> 00:29:17,575
Right, yeah, I get it.

385
00:29:17,576 --> 00:29:21,575
Let's go.

386
00:29:28,296 --> 00:29:29,935
What's the plan?

387
00:29:29,936 --> 00:29:33,935
I turn invisible, I walk up to the
security van and I take the money.

388
00:29:34,696 --> 00:29:38,695
Works for me.

389
00:29:42,256 --> 00:29:46,255
Right, keep the engine running,
just in case he gets caught. 

390
00:29:51,496 --> 00:29:54,815
Nathan, stop fucking around.
Don't touch the stereo. 

391
00:29:54,816 --> 00:29:58,375
MUSIC BLARES
Turn it off, you prick! 

392
00:29:58,376 --> 00:29:59,615
MUSIC STOPS

393
00:29:59,616 --> 00:30:00,655
Sorry. 

394
00:30:00,656 --> 00:30:03,615
Where is he?
He should've been back by now. 

395
00:30:03,616 --> 00:30:04,695
Fuck.

396
00:30:04,696 --> 00:30:06,895
How was it?

397
00:30:06,896 --> 00:30:10,015
Very easy.

398
00:30:10,016 --> 00:30:13,295
A bunch of young offenders
develop superpowers,

399
00:30:13,296 --> 00:30:17,295
and not one of us thinks of using
them to commit crime? Shame on us.

400
00:30:23,896 --> 00:30:26,735
More wine?

401
00:30:26,736 --> 00:30:30,735
Yeah, mate. Right.

402
00:30:42,016 --> 00:30:45,295
It's dead fruity.

403
00:30:45,296 --> 00:30:49,295
When I was in jail,
I thought about you.

404
00:30:49,656 --> 00:30:51,095
That's nice.

405
00:30:51,096 --> 00:30:53,415
I thought about you lying to me,

406
00:30:53,416 --> 00:30:56,575
stealing my money,

407
00:30:56,576 --> 00:30:58,695
screwing other men.

408
00:30:58,696 --> 00:31:00,815
You want to try some
positive thinking.

409
00:31:00,816 --> 00:31:04,815
You know, like fields, little
rabbits hopping around and shit.

410
00:31:06,656 --> 00:31:10,655
I wanted to see you die.

411
00:31:10,776 --> 00:31:14,775
Have some more wine, yeah?

412
00:31:16,176 --> 00:31:20,175
TYRES SCREECH

413
00:31:25,616 --> 00:31:27,855
What the fuck are you doing?

414
00:31:27,856 --> 00:31:29,455
I'm just having a look.

415
00:31:29,456 --> 00:31:31,815
Do we think this is going to work?

416
00:31:31,816 --> 00:31:35,175
When he gets the money,
it should be game over.

417
00:31:35,176 --> 00:31:38,375
Then we beat the shit out of
him and take the money back, right?

418
00:31:38,376 --> 00:31:40,655
Come on, a hundred grand's
a lot of money.

419
00:31:40,656 --> 00:31:45,295
That is true.
Our community service is nearly over.
We need to look toward the future.

420
00:31:45,496 --> 00:31:50,375
You think we should
become criminals?
HORN BEEPS

421
00:31:50,376 --> 00:31:52,255
No, we're already criminals.

422
00:31:52,256 --> 00:31:55,375
I'm talking about becoming
successful criminals -

423
00:31:55,376 --> 00:31:57,855
the ones who make money
and don't get caught,

424
00:31:57,856 --> 00:32:00,855
and have girlfriends
with enormous breast implants.

425
00:32:00,856 --> 00:32:05,655
I thought we'd use our
powers to help people?
Nah!

426
00:32:05,656 --> 00:32:09,655
We can talk about what we'regoing
to do with the money
afterwe get Kelly back.

427
00:32:12,216 --> 00:32:16,215
We're...we're way out of our depth,
but that's OK, right?

428
00:32:16,296 --> 00:32:20,175
We've all watched TV. That's how
you learn how to do this stuff.

429
00:32:20,176 --> 00:32:23,975
Just, you know, butch it up,
and play gangster. Come on.

430
00:32:23,976 --> 00:32:27,975
Let's go.

431
00:32:40,496 --> 00:32:42,975
GUN CLICKS

432
00:32:42,976 --> 00:32:46,975
You'd better have my money, Conti.

433
00:32:47,696 --> 00:32:49,815
Kelly, are you all right?

434
00:32:49,816 --> 00:32:53,775
My arms are fucking killing me.

435
00:32:53,776 --> 00:32:57,775
Slide it over.

436
00:33:19,216 --> 00:33:23,215
That's just embarrassing.

437
00:33:28,616 --> 00:33:32,615
Show me.

438
00:33:58,416 --> 00:34:01,695
Is it true?

439
00:34:01,696 --> 00:34:03,215
Is what true?

440
00:34:03,216 --> 00:34:06,775
You know what I'm talking about.

441
00:34:06,776 --> 00:34:09,855
Don't play games with me, Conti.

442
00:34:09,856 --> 00:34:13,375
He talks this bollocks all the time.

443
00:34:13,376 --> 00:34:17,375
Fat Tony says you've got an
undercover cop in your organisation.

444
00:34:17,696 --> 00:34:21,695
See? That's why I don't play computer
games, cos they never bloody end.

445
00:34:26,936 --> 00:34:29,535
Who's a cop?

446
00:34:29,536 --> 00:34:32,375
No-one.

447
00:34:32,376 --> 00:34:36,375
(Fuck!) 

448
00:34:43,997 --> 00:34:47,476
I'm going to my car
to get a chainsaw

449
00:34:47,477 --> 00:34:49,156
and when I get back,

450
00:34:49,157 --> 00:34:53,156
you're going to tell me which
one of you is the undercover cop.

451
00:35:00,557 --> 00:35:01,956
Nice one.

452
00:35:01,957 --> 00:35:03,996
Brilliant fuckin' rescue!

453
00:35:03,997 --> 00:35:06,596
No chance of a rewind?

454
00:35:06,597 --> 00:35:07,836
Get your boyfriend to sort it out.

455
00:35:07,837 --> 00:35:10,076
Er, he's not my boyfriend.

456
00:35:10,077 --> 00:35:11,756
We've split up, all right?

457
00:35:11,757 --> 00:35:13,396
So you're available?

458
00:35:13,397 --> 00:35:17,396
Not to you.

459
00:35:18,837 --> 00:35:22,836
Where's that prick inthe mask
when we need him?

460
00:35:30,517 --> 00:35:34,396
I just need to get
a bit more momentum.

461
00:35:34,397 --> 00:35:37,916
Oh, yeah. Come on! Come on!

462
00:35:37,917 --> 00:35:40,156
A few more swings

463
00:35:40,157 --> 00:35:44,156
and I should be able
to summersault right off the hook.

464
00:35:44,957 --> 00:35:48,956
Here we go! Here we go!

465
00:36:53,597 --> 00:36:55,316
Why are you hanging from meat hooks?

466
00:36:55,317 --> 00:36:59,316
This is some of the weird shit
I was telling you about.

467
00:37:00,397 --> 00:37:02,956
Isn't that the girl
whose flat we broke into?

468
00:37:02,957 --> 00:37:05,556
The new guy's heart
got transplanted into her.

469
00:37:05,557 --> 00:37:08,876
She's got his power.

470
00:37:08,877 --> 00:37:11,436
I guess that makes sense.

471
00:37:11,437 --> 00:37:12,716
You!

472
00:37:12,717 --> 00:37:16,716
Hi. Sorry about, er, you know...

473
00:37:16,757 --> 00:37:18,276
Shitting in my bed?

474
00:37:18,277 --> 00:37:22,276
Yeah. Wrong flat.

475
00:37:22,317 --> 00:37:23,996
I think you're
supposed to rescue us.

476
00:37:23,997 --> 00:37:27,996
OK.

477
00:37:31,477 --> 00:37:32,796
That's the wrong chain.

478
00:37:32,797 --> 00:37:34,196
DOOR RUMBLES

479
00:37:34,197 --> 00:37:35,276
Get out of here!

480
00:37:35,277 --> 00:37:35,756
Get out of here...

481
00:37:35,757 --> 00:37:36,796
He's coming back!

482
00:37:36,797 --> 00:37:37,836
Now!

483
00:37:37,837 --> 00:37:39,796
I can't just do it whenever I want.

484
00:37:39,797 --> 00:37:43,796
Cos that would be far
too convenient and useful.

485
00:37:48,197 --> 00:37:50,756
Who are you?

486
00:37:50,757 --> 00:37:54,756
It's complicated.

487
00:37:58,197 --> 00:38:02,196
Hands.

488
00:38:02,717 --> 00:38:05,316
CHAINS RATTLE

489
00:38:05,317 --> 00:38:08,716
You need to tell him
you're the undercover cop.

490
00:38:08,717 --> 00:38:10,516
If he kills you, it doesn't matter.

491
00:38:10,517 --> 00:38:11,956
That's easy for you to say.

492
00:38:11,957 --> 00:38:15,956
You're not the one who has to be
dismembered with a chainsaw.

493
00:38:19,957 --> 00:38:23,076
I'm sorry you got into this.

494
00:38:23,077 --> 00:38:25,836
I really hope that
thing doesn't start.

495
00:38:25,837 --> 00:38:29,036
CHAINSAW WHIRRS

496
00:38:29,037 --> 00:38:33,036
CHAINSAW PULSES

497
00:38:37,557 --> 00:38:38,636
You're first.

498
00:38:38,637 --> 00:38:39,676
Please!

499
00:38:39,677 --> 00:38:40,476
Leave her alone!

500
00:38:40,477 --> 00:38:41,916
You can't do this!

501
00:38:41,917 --> 00:38:42,956
Don't touch her!

502
00:38:42,957 --> 00:38:45,716
Leave her alone,
 you fucking psycho!

503
00:38:45,717 --> 00:38:48,196
This is insane.

504
00:38:48,197 --> 00:38:50,876
Do something!

505
00:38:50,877 --> 00:38:54,076
Wait!

506
00:38:54,077 --> 00:38:55,716
All right, all right, it's me.

507
00:38:55,717 --> 00:38:58,076
I'm the undercover cop.

508
00:38:58,077 --> 00:39:02,076
So, fire up the chainsaw,
and get with the sawing.

509
00:39:02,357 --> 00:39:06,356
And I'd appreciate it
if you'd do it quickly and cleanly.

510
00:39:06,397 --> 00:39:09,396
Oi!

511
00:39:09,397 --> 00:39:13,396
Run! RUN!

512
00:39:49,717 --> 00:39:51,836
This is not real, it's just a game!

513
00:39:51,837 --> 00:39:55,836
You think this is a game?

514
00:39:57,037 --> 00:40:01,036
This is my life.

515
00:40:06,237 --> 00:40:10,236
Oh! No!

516
00:40:15,277 --> 00:40:17,516
Conti?

517
00:40:17,517 --> 00:40:20,756
I'm the undercover cop.

518
00:40:20,757 --> 00:40:24,756
No!

519
00:40:32,597 --> 00:40:36,596
Hold on. I'll get you an ambulance.

520
00:40:38,677 --> 00:40:40,516
It has to be like this.

521
00:40:40,517 --> 00:40:41,596
Why?

522
00:40:41,597 --> 00:40:43,996
So we can be together.

523
00:40:43,997 --> 00:40:45,956
No. I won't let you die!

524
00:40:45,957 --> 00:40:48,236
You have to,

525
00:40:48,237 --> 00:40:51,716
or I'll never be this person.

526
00:40:51,717 --> 00:40:55,716
I can't do this.

527
00:40:56,077 --> 00:41:00,076
It's going to be OK.

528
00:41:03,717 --> 00:41:07,716
You have to do something.

529
00:41:08,077 --> 00:41:12,076
There's petrol in that can.

530
00:41:14,477 --> 00:41:17,636
No-one can know it's me.

531
00:41:17,637 --> 00:41:20,836
Promise me you won't tell him.

532
00:41:20,837 --> 00:41:23,276
Promise me!

533
00:41:23,277 --> 00:41:25,796
You can't die. I love you.

534
00:41:25,797 --> 00:41:28,956
I'll still be here.

535
00:41:28,957 --> 00:41:32,116
I don't love him. I love you!

536
00:41:32,117 --> 00:41:36,116
It's you falling in love with him
that makes him become me.

537
00:41:40,117 --> 00:41:44,116
It's all coming together.

538
00:41:49,237 --> 00:41:50,916
No.

539
00:41:50,917 --> 00:41:52,716
Don't!

540
00:41:52,717 --> 00:41:56,716
Simon!

541
00:41:58,197 --> 00:41:59,796
Fuck!

542
00:41:59,797 --> 00:42:03,796
Oh, God!

543
00:42:30,917 --> 00:42:34,916
# Love is like a sin my love

544
00:42:39,157 --> 00:42:43,156
# For the one that feels it the most

545
00:42:46,117 --> 00:42:47,956
# Look at her

546
00:42:47,957 --> 00:42:51,956
# With her eyes like a flame

547
00:42:53,517 --> 00:42:55,116
# She will love you

548
00:42:55,117 --> 00:42:59,036
# Like a fly will never love you

549
00:42:59,037 --> 00:43:01,236
# Again... #

550
00:43:01,237 --> 00:43:03,556
The computer game guy.

551
00:43:03,557 --> 00:43:07,556
They've arrested him.

552
00:43:13,717 --> 00:43:15,916
That's what happens when blokes
spend all their time

553
00:43:15,917 --> 00:43:19,916
playing computer games and
wanking over porn on the internet.

554
00:43:22,997 --> 00:43:26,996
Right.

555
00:43:28,597 --> 00:43:32,596
# Love is like a sin my love

556
00:43:35,637 --> 00:43:39,636
# For the one
that feels it the most.. #

557
00:43:43,197 --> 00:43:45,396
Is everything all right?

558
00:43:45,397 --> 00:43:48,476
# ..with her smile like a flame

559
00:43:48,477 --> 00:43:50,796
# She will love you

560
00:43:50,797 --> 00:43:54,796
# Like a fly will never love you

561
00:43:55,837 --> 00:43:59,836
# Again. #

562
00:44:16,037 --> 00:44:18,396
Hi.

563
00:44:18,397 --> 00:44:19,796
What was that for?

564
00:44:19,797 --> 00:44:23,796
I'm not going to die and
I'm feelingpretty happy about it.

565
00:45:32,557 --> 00:45:33,996
Jesus!

566
00:45:33,997 --> 00:45:38,996
Sorry. I was just, er...
Piss off, you pervert!

567
00:45:41,237 --> 00:45:43,036
The cute, smiley popular girl...

568
00:45:43,037 --> 00:45:44,436
I think she murdered me.

569
00:45:44,437 --> 00:45:46,156
Hi.
Hi.

570
00:45:46,157 --> 00:45:47,916
Jesus! She's after Barry!

571
00:45:47,917 --> 00:45:49,916
Would you like to gofor a drink
with me?

572
00:45:49,917 --> 00:45:52,236
I'd love to.

573
00:45:52,237 --> 00:45:53,676
Why do you want to know my name?

574
00:45:53,677 --> 00:45:54,756
I think you're beautiful.

575
00:45:54,757 --> 00:45:55,676
I'm not a slag.

576
00:45:55,677 --> 00:45:57,836
Why are the coppers after you?

577
00:45:57,837 --> 00:46:00,436
I didn't mean to hurt him,
but I didn't mean to hurt anyone.

578
00:46:00,437 --> 00:46:01,636
Especially not you.

579
00:46:01,637 --> 00:46:05,636
Get an ambulance!
Get a fucking ambulance!
