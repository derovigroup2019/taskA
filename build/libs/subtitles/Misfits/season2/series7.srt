1
00:00:01,575 --> 00:00:04,054
He said picking up litter
was the best time of his life.

2
00:00:04,055 --> 00:00:06,214
That demonstrates
his rather low expectations.

3
00:00:06,215 --> 00:00:09,134
I never said that about the litter.

4
00:00:09,135 --> 00:00:11,134
Where did you get that?
The guy in the mask.

5
00:00:11,135 --> 00:00:13,694
Who is he?
It's you.

6
00:00:13,695 --> 00:00:16,934
It's over. No more community service.

7
00:00:16,935 --> 00:00:19,894
And I have no job,
no money, no girlfriend.

8
00:00:19,895 --> 00:00:22,134
OK, so I'm immortal...

9
00:00:22,135 --> 00:00:25,294
but other than that I've basically
got fuck all going for me.

10
00:00:25,295 --> 00:00:26,734
Does anyone fancy a drink?

11
00:00:26,735 --> 00:00:28,774
Yeah, sure, man.

12
00:00:28,775 --> 00:00:31,414
You know, apart from all
the killing and the dying and stuff,

13
00:00:31,415 --> 00:00:35,414
it really wasn't as bad
as I thought it was going to be.

14
00:00:40,215 --> 00:00:44,214
# EELS: Christmas Is
Going To The Dogs

15
00:00:48,855 --> 00:00:51,814
# Get off your sled, and go to bed

16
00:00:51,815 --> 00:00:54,614
# Don't you ever tire?

17
00:00:54,615 --> 00:00:57,694
# Throw a bone, I'm finally home

18
00:00:57,695 --> 00:01:00,414
# Curled up by the fire

19
00:01:00,415 --> 00:01:02,894
# Snow is fallin' from the sky

20
00:01:02,895 --> 00:01:06,294
# Like ashes from an urn

21
00:01:06,295 --> 00:01:08,934
# Sweet dreams, my little one... #

22
00:01:08,935 --> 00:01:10,414
What a loser.

23
00:01:10,415 --> 00:01:12,014
# Now it's my turn... #

24
00:01:12,015 --> 00:01:14,094
Fuck you!

25
00:01:14,095 --> 00:01:18,094
# Well, Christmas
is going to the dogs... #

26
00:01:21,215 --> 00:01:25,214
Ah! Merry Christmas, little fella!

27
00:01:29,735 --> 00:01:31,974
Hey, I'm not a paedophile!

28
00:01:31,975 --> 00:01:35,094
Yeah... Ah... Ah... Ah...

29
00:01:35,095 --> 00:01:37,294
Oh! No! No...

30
00:01:37,295 --> 00:01:41,294
Oh, shit!

31
00:01:48,855 --> 00:01:52,854
# And Christmas is going to the dogs

32
00:01:54,535 --> 00:01:58,534
# We're scarfin' down the turkey
and eggnog

33
00:02:00,535 --> 00:02:04,534
# And things aren't looking
very good, it's true

34
00:02:06,335 --> 00:02:10,334
# So I'll just lay here, and chew

35
00:02:12,175 --> 00:02:16,094
# So I'll just stay here

36
00:02:16,095 --> 00:02:20,094
# And chew #

37
00:02:36,935 --> 00:02:38,574
# The city breathing

38
00:02:38,575 --> 00:02:40,414
# The people churning

39
00:02:40,415 --> 00:02:42,094
# The conversating

40
00:02:42,095 --> 00:02:46,094
# The price is what?

41
00:02:58,095 --> 00:03:00,094
# The conversating

42
00:03:00,095 --> 00:03:01,974
# This place is heaven

43
00:03:01,975 --> 00:03:05,974
# And if you see them... #

44
00:03:30,452 --> 00:03:34,451
It was crap,
he nearly came in his pants...

45
00:03:35,172 --> 00:03:39,171
You should try giving him one...!
>

46
00:03:46,892 --> 00:03:49,091
You're going to break your neck.

47
00:03:49,092 --> 00:03:51,011
I'm not pushing you around
in a wheelchair.

48
00:03:51,012 --> 00:03:53,291
I have to learn sometime.

49
00:03:53,292 --> 00:03:57,131
Show me...

50
00:03:57,132 --> 00:04:00,651
You'd better do it.

51
00:04:00,652 --> 00:04:03,931
So being Santa sucks a big fat cock.

52
00:04:03,932 --> 00:04:05,891
Two pints of lager please, barmaid.

53
00:04:05,892 --> 00:04:08,331
Are you going to pay for them?
No.

54
00:04:08,332 --> 00:04:12,011
Oh, come on! I've been working for
the council scraping up dog shit.

55
00:04:12,012 --> 00:04:15,691
That's thirsty work.

56
00:04:15,692 --> 00:04:18,211
So how did it all
go so right for you?

57
00:04:18,212 --> 00:04:21,251
You end up with a cool flat,
and a beautiful girlfriend?

58
00:04:21,252 --> 00:04:22,771
I think it's dead romantic, I do.

59
00:04:22,772 --> 00:04:26,771
I think I liked it better when you
suffered from a crippling shyness.

60
00:04:29,332 --> 00:04:33,331
No way! No more free drink...

61
00:04:39,932 --> 00:04:41,891
You're going to get us both sacked.

62
00:04:41,892 --> 00:04:44,811
Do you really want to spend your
life working in some shitty bar?

63
00:04:44,812 --> 00:04:45,811
No...

64
00:04:45,812 --> 00:04:49,371
Then I'm doing you a favour.
Refill!

65
00:04:49,372 --> 00:04:52,171
This is fucking ridiculous!

66
00:04:52,172 --> 00:04:54,331
I had to walk back
from the other side of the estate.

67
00:04:54,332 --> 00:04:55,931
Are you OK?

68
00:05:06,212 --> 00:05:07,171
Want a look?!

69
00:05:07,172 --> 00:05:08,891
I wouldn't mind.

70
00:05:08,892 --> 00:05:12,891
After all, it is nearly Christmas.

71
00:05:19,692 --> 00:05:23,331
I wouldn't do that if I were you.
That's how babies become dwarfs.

72
00:05:23,332 --> 00:05:25,531
I like dwarfs.

73
00:05:25,532 --> 00:05:27,051
Me too. Who are you?

74
00:05:27,052 --> 00:05:29,011
I'm Marnie.

75
00:05:29,012 --> 00:05:31,691
And this baby of yours,
who's the dad?

76
00:05:31,692 --> 00:05:35,691
Depends if it's white, or black,
or Chinese or...French.

77
00:05:36,292 --> 00:05:37,811
Those brown babies are very cute.

78
00:05:37,812 --> 00:05:40,411
And I like a Chinese baby
as much as the next man.

79
00:05:40,412 --> 00:05:42,371
Me too.

80
00:05:42,372 --> 00:05:44,771
Whoever the dad is, he's not around.

81
00:05:44,772 --> 00:05:46,331
So you're all alone in the world...

82
00:05:46,332 --> 00:05:48,611
apart from the living organism
growing inside you?

83
00:05:48,612 --> 00:05:52,611
Looks that way.

84
00:05:52,732 --> 00:05:54,451
We should probably go for a drink.

85
00:05:54,452 --> 00:05:56,051
Swap some funny stories.

86
00:05:56,052 --> 00:05:58,411
See if we have
similar tastes and interests.

87
00:05:58,412 --> 00:06:01,731
Overcome some emotional hurdles.
And have a few huge rows.

88
00:06:01,732 --> 00:06:04,291
What did you do, you stupid prick?!

89
00:06:04,292 --> 00:06:05,411
I'm sorry, baby,

90
00:06:05,412 --> 00:06:08,331
I didn't know we were exclusive -
and she had massive tits.

91
00:06:08,332 --> 00:06:09,531
It'll never happen again.

92
00:06:09,532 --> 00:06:11,211
We make up, and before you know what

93
00:06:11,212 --> 00:06:13,371
I've trapped you
in a serious relationship.

94
00:06:13,372 --> 00:06:15,411
That would be
the conventional way to do it.

95
00:06:15,412 --> 00:06:17,891
There's just one problem.

96
00:06:17,892 --> 00:06:19,891
I can't drink.

97
00:06:19,892 --> 00:06:22,291
So...I guess we should
skip all that other stuff

98
00:06:22,292 --> 00:06:26,291
and get straight down
to the shagging.

99
00:06:49,092 --> 00:06:51,051
I don't want to poke
the baby in the eye.

100
00:06:51,052 --> 00:06:53,131
Just...do it gently.

101
00:06:53,132 --> 00:06:57,131
Fuck me, Santa.

102
00:07:16,372 --> 00:07:20,371
I'm here about my power.

103
00:07:43,252 --> 00:07:47,251
Take a seat.

104
00:07:49,452 --> 00:07:52,851
So what can you do?

105
00:07:52,852 --> 00:07:55,251
Er...

106
00:07:55,252 --> 00:07:58,011
Anyone who touches me,

107
00:07:58,012 --> 00:07:59,491
they want to shag me.

108
00:07:59,492 --> 00:08:03,491
super-horny or something.

109
00:08:03,492 --> 00:08:06,931
I can see how that
would be a problem.

110
00:08:06,932 --> 00:08:10,931
How much do you want for it?

111
00:08:11,212 --> 00:08:15,211
I don't want anything,
I...just want it gone.

112
00:08:15,412 --> 00:08:19,411
Can you do that?

113
00:08:20,292 --> 00:08:24,291
That's why I'm here.

114
00:08:25,092 --> 00:08:27,211
You won't use it on anyone, will you?

115
00:08:27,212 --> 00:08:30,531
I can't use the powers
while I'm holding them.

116
00:08:30,532 --> 00:08:32,051
What will you do with it, then?

117
00:08:32,052 --> 00:08:36,051
That's not your problem.

118
00:08:37,172 --> 00:08:39,251
Look...

119
00:08:39,252 --> 00:08:43,251
..I can give you your life back.

120
00:08:43,652 --> 00:08:47,651
That's what you want, right? >

121
00:08:48,892 --> 00:08:52,891
Give me your hand.

122
00:09:59,132 --> 00:10:03,131
It's all there.

123
00:10:28,412 --> 00:10:32,451
Hi.
Hi.

124
00:10:32,452 --> 00:10:34,171
I don't want you to freak out...

125
00:10:34,172 --> 00:10:37,651
Why would I...

126
00:10:37,652 --> 00:10:41,451
There's this guy. I went to see him.
He took my power.

127
00:10:41,452 --> 00:10:43,211
How?

128
00:10:43,212 --> 00:10:46,131
He touched me. It's gone.

129
00:10:46,132 --> 00:10:48,011
What's he going to do with it?

130
00:10:48,012 --> 00:10:49,411
I don't know.

131
00:10:49,412 --> 00:10:53,411
Doesn't matter. It's gone.

132
00:10:54,092 --> 00:10:58,091
I want to be able to touch you.

133
00:11:00,892 --> 00:11:04,891
I want it to be like it was.

134
00:11:06,412 --> 00:11:10,411
We had great sex.

135
00:11:10,772 --> 00:11:14,771
I miss having sex with you.

136
00:11:16,052 --> 00:11:20,051
Kiss me.

137
00:11:21,052 --> 00:11:23,051
# ..when my baby

138
00:11:23,052 --> 00:11:27,051
# When my baby comes home

139
00:11:30,932 --> 00:11:34,051
# He said not to worry

140
00:11:34,052 --> 00:11:36,971
# Don't sit by the phone

141
00:11:36,972 --> 00:11:39,771
# Soon I'll be home, baby

142
00:11:39,772 --> 00:11:43,011
# You'll never be alone

143
00:11:43,012 --> 00:11:46,011
# I expect to see him

144
00:11:46,012 --> 00:11:48,371
# Sometime today

145
00:11:48,372 --> 00:11:51,251
# I know my baby

146
00:11:51,252 --> 00:11:54,491
# Is never going away... #

147
00:11:56,012 --> 00:11:59,451
Doesn't matter.

148
00:11:59,452 --> 00:12:01,811
Simon...

149
00:12:01,812 --> 00:12:05,811
..look at me.

150
00:12:06,972 --> 00:12:09,811
He was much better than me,
wasn't he?

151
00:12:09,812 --> 00:12:13,811
No... It was different.

152
00:12:17,892 --> 00:12:21,451
I hate thinking about
you being with him.

153
00:12:21,452 --> 00:12:23,691
It was you!

154
00:12:23,692 --> 00:12:27,171
You're the same person.

155
00:12:27,172 --> 00:12:31,171
Except he's much better than me,
isn't he?

156
00:12:37,692 --> 00:12:41,691
You'll always love him
more than you love me.

157
00:12:43,772 --> 00:12:47,771
Simon...

158
00:13:28,972 --> 00:13:32,971
How are you doing that? >

159
00:13:38,892 --> 00:13:42,491
I'm Jesus Christ...

160
00:13:42,492 --> 00:13:45,331
..and I have been reborn.

161
00:14:17,497 --> 00:14:20,016
I want to be there for you,
you and the baby.

162
00:14:20,017 --> 00:14:21,336
Have you got any money?

163
00:14:21,337 --> 00:14:23,376
I'm not being funny,
you look seriously poor.

164
00:14:23,377 --> 00:14:27,296
Maybe I'm a multimillionaire who just
chooses to live in the community centre.

165
00:14:27,297 --> 00:14:28,456
And are you?

166
00:14:28,457 --> 00:14:32,456
No. That would be ridiculous!

167
00:14:35,577 --> 00:14:39,576
40, 60...

168
00:14:39,977 --> 00:14:42,936
1.67. Oh!

169
00:14:42,937 --> 00:14:45,456
1.68.

170
00:14:45,457 --> 00:14:48,576
That's everything I have
in the entire world. Take it.

171
00:14:48,577 --> 00:14:51,256
I want you to have it.

172
00:14:51,257 --> 00:14:55,256
That's the nicest thing
anyone's ever done for me.

173
00:14:55,297 --> 00:14:59,296
Actually, can I just get
50p back for a Kit-Kat?

174
00:15:03,977 --> 00:15:05,376
Oh, Jesus!

175
00:15:05,377 --> 00:15:06,576
What's wrong?

176
00:15:06,577 --> 00:15:08,696
The baby's on my bladder.
I pissed myself.

177
00:15:08,697 --> 00:15:10,096
Oh. Don't worry about it.

178
00:15:10,097 --> 00:15:13,896
I've pissed and shit myself
more times than I can remember.

179
00:15:13,897 --> 00:15:17,896
Me too.

180
00:15:26,017 --> 00:15:28,576
I'll be right with you.
Hiya. You must be Barry?

181
00:15:28,577 --> 00:15:31,296
Nathan's told me so much about you.

182
00:15:35,857 --> 00:15:37,936
Phew!

183
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:39,776
Who's she?

184
00:15:39,777 --> 00:15:41,256
He took her power.

185
00:15:41,257 --> 00:15:43,376
So how much did she get for it?

186
00:15:43,377 --> 00:15:45,896
Nothing.
She wanted to get rid of it.

187
00:15:45,897 --> 00:15:47,536
She can touch people.

188
00:15:47,537 --> 00:15:51,536
I can touch her.

189
00:15:52,657 --> 00:15:53,696
We had sex.

190
00:15:53,697 --> 00:15:57,696
Ah! So you finally get to
sample the goods, and they're...

191
00:15:59,377 --> 00:16:01,376
Not as advertised?

192
00:16:01,377 --> 00:16:05,176
Is she one of those girls with really
long pubes, down to her knees?

193
00:16:05,177 --> 00:16:06,016
No.

194
00:16:06,017 --> 00:16:07,816
No.
Has she got an extroverted vagina?

195
00:16:07,817 --> 00:16:10,296
Because they can fix that
in an operation, man!

196
00:16:10,297 --> 00:16:11,616
I was shit.

197
00:16:11,617 --> 00:16:13,016
Oh!

198
00:16:13,017 --> 00:16:16,696
So you're after some sex tips
from a far more experienced lover!

199
00:16:16,697 --> 00:16:17,896
Two words.

200
00:16:17,897 --> 00:16:19,816
Fisherman's Friend.

201
00:16:19,817 --> 00:16:22,096
Isn't that a cough sweet?

202
00:16:22,097 --> 00:16:25,616
You pop one of those bad boys in your
mouth and then you head due south

203
00:16:25,617 --> 00:16:27,896
and you pleasure her, orally.

204
00:16:27,897 --> 00:16:31,296
And it's the menthol.
She'll feel like her pussy's on fire.

205
00:16:31,297 --> 00:16:33,096
Huh?

206
00:16:33,097 --> 00:16:37,016
Ah, I always keep some on me,
just in case I'm required to perform.

207
00:16:37,017 --> 00:16:38,616
Go on.

208
00:16:38,617 --> 00:16:39,856
That's for you.

209
00:16:39,857 --> 00:16:43,856
I think that young lady is going
to have a very merry Christmas!

210
00:16:45,297 --> 00:16:47,096
I'll tell you something else, man,

211
00:16:47,097 --> 00:16:51,096
if the girl's pregnant,
it makes the baby kick like a nutter!

212
00:16:53,737 --> 00:16:57,736
See you, man.

213
00:17:04,817 --> 00:17:08,816
Hi.

214
00:17:16,977 --> 00:17:18,616
So, what have you got?

215
00:17:18,617 --> 00:17:20,496
Immortality.

216
00:17:20,497 --> 00:17:24,496
So that's off the A list.

217
00:17:26,537 --> 00:17:28,416
How much d'you want for it?

218
00:17:28,417 --> 00:17:30,696
I will not settle for a penny less...

219
00:17:30,697 --> 00:17:34,696
than one million pounds.

220
00:17:35,177 --> 00:17:39,176
# EARTHA KITT: Santa, Baby

221
00:17:44,257 --> 00:17:45,736
What's this?

222
00:17:45,737 --> 00:17:49,136
That's two grand,
for you and the baby.

223
00:17:49,137 --> 00:17:53,016
Yeah, it should've been more, but I
got really beaten down on the price.

224
00:17:53,017 --> 00:17:54,616
How did you get it?

225
00:17:54,617 --> 00:17:56,856
Did you suck off
some fat German tourist?

226
00:17:56,857 --> 00:18:00,856
No! No. I sold my immortality.

227
00:18:01,617 --> 00:18:02,976
What?

228
00:18:02,977 --> 00:18:06,976
It's a long and
totally ridiculous story.

229
00:18:07,057 --> 00:18:11,056
I am here to help you change your
life today, right now, this moment.

230
00:18:11,897 --> 00:18:14,736
I know what it's like
living on this estate.

231
00:18:14,737 --> 00:18:17,896
I know what it's like to feel
disappointment, to feel pain,

232
00:18:17,897 --> 00:18:19,736
to feel angry...
What's all this?

233
00:18:19,737 --> 00:18:22,096
Our Lord, Jesus Christ,
has risen again.

234
00:18:22,097 --> 00:18:23,176
Right.

235
00:18:23,177 --> 00:18:24,896
Good for him.

236
00:18:24,897 --> 00:18:27,536
- It's nice he's come back in time
for Christmas. - Yeah.

237
00:18:27,537 --> 00:18:31,216
I promise I will change your lives
forever, this day, this moment.

238
00:18:31,217 --> 00:18:33,856
Give us the money. Do it!

239
00:18:33,857 --> 00:18:36,776
I know what it's like to...

240
00:18:36,777 --> 00:18:40,496
Did no-one ever tell you
that stealing is a sin?

241
00:18:40,497 --> 00:18:43,256
Who are you?
I'm Jesus Christ.

242
00:18:43,257 --> 00:18:50,096
- Yeah? Well, I need to score, so you're
getting robbed. - I don't think so.

243
00:19:01,137 --> 00:19:05,136
It's another miracle!

244
00:19:05,377 --> 00:19:09,096
You need to do
some serious repenting.

245
00:19:09,097 --> 00:19:11,896
If you wish to enter
the Kingdom of Heaven,

246
00:19:11,897 --> 00:19:15,896
you must give generously, so that
we can spread the word of our Lord.

247
00:19:18,577 --> 00:19:22,576
Spread.

248
00:19:36,097 --> 00:19:38,896
It's so weird that I can do this.

249
00:19:38,897 --> 00:19:40,376
How does it feel?

250
00:19:40,377 --> 00:19:43,776
It's so nice not to have
to think about it anymore.

251
00:19:43,777 --> 00:19:45,616
Maybe we'd all be better off
without them.

252
00:19:45,617 --> 00:19:46,696
What're you saying?

253
00:19:46,697 --> 00:19:50,616
I'm saying this random teleporting
all over the place,

254
00:19:50,617 --> 00:19:52,256
it's a pain in the arse.

255
00:19:52,257 --> 00:19:54,616
What has any of us
actually achieved with our powers?

256
00:19:54,617 --> 00:19:56,256
Apart from saving all our lives?

257
00:19:56,257 --> 00:19:58,536
We wouldn't need saving
if it wasn't for the powers.

258
00:19:58,537 --> 00:20:00,496
We don't need to be caught up
in this bullshit.

259
00:20:00,497 --> 00:20:04,016
D'you think it's all right
to just flog our powers like that?

260
00:20:04,017 --> 00:20:06,536
I don't know if you've noticed, but
we're not exactly living the dream.

261
00:20:06,537 --> 00:20:09,336
You always hated hearing
what people thought about you.

262
00:20:09,337 --> 00:20:10,736
That's because most people
are two-faced dickheads.

263
00:20:10,737 --> 00:20:12,296
I think we should see this guy.

264
00:20:12,297 --> 00:20:16,296
See how much he offers us.

265
00:20:19,097 --> 00:20:23,096
Look, it's worth
having a conversation.

266
00:20:25,057 --> 00:20:29,056
All right.

267
00:20:38,657 --> 00:20:41,056
What're you doing here?

268
00:20:41,057 --> 00:20:43,136
I wanted to know what he was doing
with the powers. Why are you here?

269
00:20:43,137 --> 00:20:45,576
20 fucking grand!

270
00:20:45,577 --> 00:20:46,976
You sold your powers?

271
00:20:46,977 --> 00:20:47,976
Yeah, mate.

272
00:20:47,977 --> 00:20:51,176
Yeah, mate. You shouldn't be doing this.
We were given them for a reason.

273
00:20:51,177 --> 00:20:51,656
And what reason's that?

274
00:20:51,657 --> 00:20:54,496
- And what reason's that? - I'll give you
20,000 reasons for getting rid of 'em.

275
00:20:54,497 --> 00:20:55,816
It's like in Superman II,

276
00:20:55,817 --> 00:20:59,056
when Superman gives up his powers
so he could be with Lois Lane.

277
00:20:59,057 --> 00:21:00,536
And?

278
00:21:00,537 --> 00:21:02,056
General Zod took over the world!

279
00:21:02,057 --> 00:21:04,736
That's totally relevant,
except there ain't no General Zod,

280
00:21:04,737 --> 00:21:07,656
and that's 20,000.

281
00:21:07,657 --> 00:21:11,656
Later.

282
00:21:12,777 --> 00:21:15,056
I just want us
to be a normal couple.

283
00:21:15,057 --> 00:21:17,376
I don't think we ever can be.

284
00:21:17,377 --> 00:21:20,656
Yeah, but...
You don't need to be invisible.

285
00:21:20,657 --> 00:21:23,296
You're not that person anymore.

286
00:21:23,297 --> 00:21:26,376
You've moved on. We've all moved on.

287
00:21:26,377 --> 00:21:30,376
It's part of who I am.

288
00:21:31,337 --> 00:21:35,336
You told me we should do this.

289
00:21:35,577 --> 00:21:38,656
Are you from the future?

290
00:21:38,657 --> 00:21:40,256
I told you we should
give up our powers?

291
00:21:40,257 --> 00:21:41,456
Yeah.

292
00:21:41,457 --> 00:21:45,456
We're supposed to do this.

293
00:22:00,257 --> 00:22:04,256
Are you buying or selling?

294
00:22:23,938 --> 00:22:27,737
Coming to bed?

295
00:22:27,738 --> 00:22:31,337
This is part of the sex.
You just need some practice.

296
00:22:31,338 --> 00:22:34,777
It's how you get good.

297
00:22:34,778 --> 00:22:38,697
# Oh, happy day

298
00:22:38,698 --> 00:22:41,417

00:23:33,258 --> 00:23:36,817
# Fight and pray

323
00:23:36,818 --> 00:23:40,697
# Fight and pray

324
00:23:40,698 --> 00:23:44,697
# And he'll rejoice

325
00:23:45,898 --> 00:23:49,897
# In things we say

326
00:23:50,818 --> 00:23:52,777

339
00:24:36,458 --> 00:24:38,697
Jesus?

340
00:24:38,698 --> 00:24:42,697
Hi.

341
00:24:52,578 --> 00:24:56,577
Is that really the best you can do?

342
00:24:58,258 --> 00:25:00,417
I'll break it down for you.

343
00:25:00,418 --> 00:25:03,577
Do you want to go to heaven,

344
00:25:03,578 --> 00:25:07,537
or d'you want to burn in hell
for all eternity? Hm.

345
00:25:07,538 --> 00:25:08,897
That's all they had to give.

346
00:25:08,898 --> 00:25:12,897
If they won't give willingly,
you take it from them.

347
00:25:13,538 --> 00:25:17,537
You said robbing people was wrong.

348
00:25:18,778 --> 00:25:22,777
Now you're doing it for God, it's OK.

349
00:25:24,938 --> 00:25:28,937
Go forth unto the world,
and bring me some money!

350
00:25:50,418 --> 00:25:54,417
Chin chin! Here's to life.

351
00:26:01,698 --> 00:26:05,657
So now you're going travelling, suddenly
you're all cool about giving out free drinks?

352
00:26:05,658 --> 00:26:07,857
I am so looking forward to not
having to listen to your shit.

353
00:26:07,858 --> 00:26:11,857
I'll miss you, too.

354
00:26:16,938 --> 00:26:18,257
What?

355
00:26:18,258 --> 00:26:20,017
You look amazing.

356
00:26:20,018 --> 00:26:21,537
Do you think so?

357
00:26:21,538 --> 00:26:25,057
Yeah, well classy.

358
00:26:25,058 --> 00:26:26,977
The woman in the shop
thought I was shoplifting.

359
00:26:26,978 --> 00:26:29,457
Got my wad of cash out.
She looked proper sick.

360
00:26:29,458 --> 00:26:31,537
Should've seen her.

361
00:26:31,538 --> 00:26:34,537
Set me up.

362
00:26:34,538 --> 00:26:35,937
So where are you going first?

363
00:26:35,938 --> 00:26:38,577
Thailand. We fly to Bangkok,
then we hit the beaches.

364
00:26:38,578 --> 00:26:42,577
D'you think you might have a go
on one of those Thai lady boys?

365
00:26:42,738 --> 00:26:44,817
Yeah. I see that happening.

366
00:26:44,818 --> 00:26:47,937
You may not know until it's too late.
I didn't have a clue, man.

367
00:26:47,938 --> 00:26:49,337
Have you been to Thailand?

368
00:26:49,338 --> 00:26:52,257
No. I met this little fella
at a party on the estate.

369
00:26:52,258 --> 00:26:54,177
What, and you went with him?

370
00:26:54,178 --> 00:26:57,217
Let's just say,
I didn't not go with him.

371
00:26:57,218 --> 00:27:00,217
I was very drunk, and he had his cock
and balls taped into his arse crack.

372
00:27:00,218 --> 00:27:04,217
From where I was kneeling,
it looked like a bald little pussy.

373
00:27:06,258 --> 00:27:09,897
Can I get you something?
Empty the till and the safe!

374
00:27:09,898 --> 00:27:11,497
Yeah, good one, mate.

375
00:27:11,498 --> 00:27:15,017
What the fuck are you doing?!

376
00:27:15,018 --> 00:27:20,257
Just give us the money. Do it!
All right.

377
00:27:20,258 --> 00:27:22,017
And the safe.

378
00:27:22,018 --> 00:27:24,057
They don't trust me with
the keys to the safe.

379
00:27:24,058 --> 00:27:25,697
That's because you're always
giving people free drinks.

380
00:27:25,698 --> 00:27:27,777
Back off!
Move!

381
00:27:27,778 --> 00:27:31,777
Give us your money!
Give us your cash!

382
00:27:35,738 --> 00:27:36,737
Where's yours?

383
00:27:36,738 --> 00:27:39,097
I haven't got any.
I never have any. Ask anyone.

384
00:27:39,098 --> 00:27:40,217
Hand it over.

385
00:27:40,218 --> 00:27:41,497
Just give him the money!

386
00:27:41,498 --> 00:27:43,217
No. That's for Marnie and the baby!

387
00:27:43,218 --> 00:27:45,857
Do you think I'm joking?

388
00:27:45,858 --> 00:27:48,777
Actually,
I really couldn't give a fuck.

389
00:27:48,778 --> 00:27:50,457
Back off!

390
00:27:50,458 --> 00:27:52,777
Go ahead.

391
00:27:52,778 --> 00:27:56,417
Shoot me!

392
00:27:56,418 --> 00:27:58,817
I'm immortal!

393
00:27:58,818 --> 00:28:02,457
No, you're not.

394
00:28:02,458 --> 00:28:06,457
Nikki!

395
00:28:09,698 --> 00:28:13,697
Someone call an ambulance!

396
00:28:19,738 --> 00:28:22,817
Is she breathing?

397
00:28:22,818 --> 00:28:26,817
Nikki!

398
00:29:01,938 --> 00:29:05,937
I'm going to get my power back.
I'm going to turn back time.

399
00:29:07,778 --> 00:29:11,777
I'm going to save her.

400
00:29:12,738 --> 00:29:15,297
I knew there was
something up with that lad.

401
00:29:15,298 --> 00:29:19,297
If I'd had my power,
I could've stopped it.

402
00:29:22,058 --> 00:29:26,057
If I die, I won't be there
for Marnie and the baby.

403
00:29:34,098 --> 00:29:37,697
I can't go back to being like that.

404
00:29:37,698 --> 00:29:41,697
I'm sorry.

405
00:30:01,498 --> 00:30:03,457
I need my power back.

406
00:30:03,458 --> 00:30:05,657
That's not going to be possible.

407
00:30:05,658 --> 00:30:07,177
What're you talking about?

408
00:30:07,178 --> 00:30:08,377
I don't have it.

409
00:30:08,378 --> 00:30:09,417
What d'you mean, you don't have it?

410
00:30:09,418 --> 00:30:11,777
I sold it to an old Jewish guy.

411
00:30:11,778 --> 00:30:15,777
He said he wanted to
rewind time and kill Hitler.

412
00:30:16,098 --> 00:30:17,817
You've got to admire his ambition.

413
00:30:17,818 --> 00:30:20,057
My girlfriend's dead.
I need my power.

414
00:30:20,058 --> 00:30:21,777
C'mon, man!

415
00:30:21,778 --> 00:30:25,417
I'm sorry about your girlfriend,
but I can't help you.

416
00:30:25,418 --> 00:30:27,777
What about the rest of our powers?

417
00:30:27,778 --> 00:30:29,297
We're gonna need those back, too.

418
00:30:29,298 --> 00:30:31,817
They're still available, at a price.

419
00:30:31,818 --> 00:30:35,737
How much?

420
00:30:35,738 --> 00:30:39,257
Shall we say 40,000, each.

421
00:30:39,258 --> 00:30:41,537
You only paid us 20 grand!

422
00:30:41,538 --> 00:30:44,817
What, you got 20,000 for your power?

423
00:30:44,818 --> 00:30:46,377
Yeah. How much did you get?

424
00:30:46,378 --> 00:30:48,857
We don't need to get into that now.

425
00:30:48,858 --> 00:30:50,137
You robbed me, you bastard!

426
00:30:50,138 --> 00:30:53,017
You all agreed a price
you were happy to sell at.

427
00:30:53,018 --> 00:30:57,017
I didn't think it through,
so legally, it's still mine.

428
00:30:59,018 --> 00:31:03,017
You get me my power.

429
00:31:03,138 --> 00:31:07,137
It's not going to happen.

430
00:31:09,338 --> 00:31:13,017
You either get him his power back,
or I start kicking you in the balls.

431
00:31:13,018 --> 00:31:17,017
Yeah, I've seen her do it.
You won't enjoy it one little bit.

432
00:31:18,178 --> 00:31:22,177
I really wouldn't do
that if I were you.

433
00:31:24,258 --> 00:31:27,577
Him?
Are you for real?

434
00:31:27,578 --> 00:31:29,497
He couldn't fuck his way
out of a paper bag, mate.

435
00:31:29,498 --> 00:31:33,497
Look at him. He's got the body of a small,
malnourished, prepubescent child.

436
00:31:36,458 --> 00:31:39,377
Oh? Hey there, little fella...

437
00:31:39,378 --> 00:31:43,377
Argh!

438
00:31:49,898 --> 00:31:53,817
Open the fucking door!
Open the fuck...

439
00:31:53,818 --> 00:31:55,897
Open it!

440
00:31:55,898 --> 00:31:59,897
What're you gonna do?

441
00:32:04,498 --> 00:32:08,497
Argh. I think he broke a rib.

442
00:32:31,538 --> 00:32:33,577
Hi.

443
00:32:33,578 --> 00:32:37,217
Fuck off.

444
00:32:37,218 --> 00:32:39,617
That wasn't very friendly.

445
00:32:39,618 --> 00:32:41,857
What do you want?

446
00:32:41,858 --> 00:32:44,297
I just want to chat.
I'm Jesus.

447
00:32:44,298 --> 00:32:48,297
I know you. The guy who takes
the powers. You were there.

448
00:32:50,058 --> 00:32:53,897
You got me.

449
00:32:53,898 --> 00:32:55,217
You're very pretty.

450
00:32:55,218 --> 00:32:59,217
That's original.

451
00:32:59,258 --> 00:33:03,257
I want to fuck your brains out.

452
00:33:05,418 --> 00:33:09,417
Come on, let's go.

453
00:33:13,778 --> 00:33:17,457
Jesus?

454
00:33:17,458 --> 00:33:20,937
I, er... I shot someone.

455
00:33:20,938 --> 00:33:22,257
You did what?

456
00:33:22,258 --> 00:33:24,617
I didn't mean to.

457
00:33:24,618 --> 00:33:28,617
She's dead.

458
00:33:32,498 --> 00:33:36,497
You've got my power.

459
00:33:43,098 --> 00:33:45,137
She was just a girl.

460
00:33:45,138 --> 00:33:46,857
I killed her!

461
00:33:46,858 --> 00:33:50,857
Are you sorry?

462
00:33:51,378 --> 00:33:55,377
Then God forgives you.

463
00:33:55,778 --> 00:33:59,577
Seriously?
Just like that?

464
00:33:59,578 --> 00:34:02,697
Just like that.
Everything bad you've ever done.

465
00:34:02,698 --> 00:34:06,697
All the stealing,
drugs and masturbating.

466
00:34:10,738 --> 00:34:14,737
Don't worry about it.
You're forgiven!

467
00:34:19,338 --> 00:34:23,337
Off you go, then.

468
00:34:45,738 --> 00:34:49,737
Alisha? What is it? What happened?

469
00:34:49,778 --> 00:34:51,217
I lied to you.

470
00:34:51,218 --> 00:34:55,217
You never said we were
supposed to give up our powers.

471
00:34:57,978 --> 00:35:01,977
But I just wanted us to be normal.

472
00:35:03,018 --> 00:35:04,697
You shouldn't have done that.

473
00:35:04,698 --> 00:35:08,697
Sorry!

474
00:35:09,258 --> 00:35:13,257
We started this,
and now Nikki's dead.

475
00:35:13,738 --> 00:35:15,137
It's OK.

476
00:35:15,138 --> 00:35:19,137
No, it's not OK.

477
00:35:19,738 --> 00:35:22,937
What is it?

478
00:35:22,938 --> 00:35:26,697
There's a guy calling himself Jesus.

479
00:35:26,698 --> 00:35:30,697
He's got my power.
He used it on me.

480
00:35:30,858 --> 00:35:32,417
Did you...?

481
00:35:32,418 --> 00:35:36,417
No. I got away,

482
00:35:36,618 --> 00:35:39,257
but the boy who robbed the
bar, he was there, and...

483
00:35:39,258 --> 00:35:43,257
I think the Jesus guy
put him up to it.

484
00:35:45,938 --> 00:35:49,217
Where're you going?

485
00:35:49,218 --> 00:35:51,737
I'm going to kill Jesus.

486
00:35:51,738 --> 00:35:55,737
I'm coming with you.

487
00:36:07,248 --> 00:36:10,487
Ah! Everybody, this is Marnie.

488
00:36:10,488 --> 00:36:11,087
Hi.

489
00:36:11,088 --> 00:36:12,367
Hi.
These are my friends.

490
00:36:12,368 --> 00:36:13,487
I'm not your friend.

491
00:36:13,488 --> 00:36:14,647
She's lying.

492
00:36:14,648 --> 00:36:18,647
The guy who killed Nikki.
He was doing it for Jesus.

493
00:36:30,448 --> 00:36:32,047
Oh, what?

494
00:36:32,048 --> 00:36:34,047
Is that the guy?

495
00:36:34,048 --> 00:36:35,287
Can I help you?

496
00:36:35,288 --> 00:36:38,807
You can't go around pretending
to be Jesus. What's God gonna say?

497
00:36:38,808 --> 00:36:40,767
You haven't even got a beard!

498
00:36:40,768 --> 00:36:42,807
Hey! I gave my life to him.

499
00:36:42,808 --> 00:36:45,687
I went without money and sex.
What a joke!

500
00:36:45,688 --> 00:36:48,527
I preached and prayed,
and no-one gave a shit.

501
00:36:48,528 --> 00:36:50,887
You do a few miracles, everyone
thinks you're the messiah.

502
00:36:50,888 --> 00:36:52,847
Have you seen that lot out there?

503
00:36:52,848 --> 00:36:56,287
I've given their lives....meaning.

504
00:36:56,288 --> 00:36:57,807
I'm sorry. Would you mind

505
00:36:57,808 --> 00:36:59,767
getting her to stop?
That's very distracting.

506
00:36:59,768 --> 00:37:01,447
One of your followers
killed my girlfriend...

507
00:37:01,448 --> 00:37:03,327
You're exploiting the vulnerable.

508
00:37:03,328 --> 00:37:05,927
You're taking money off pupils.
You're sexually assaulting girls.

509
00:37:05,928 --> 00:37:08,687
Hey.
That's the Catholic Church for you.

510
00:37:08,688 --> 00:37:10,927
He's got a point.
When I was growing up in Ireland,

511
00:37:10,928 --> 00:37:13,607
if the priests weren't fiddling with
you, you were one of the ugly kids.

512
00:37:13,608 --> 00:37:17,607
I'm going to finish you.

513
00:37:36,968 --> 00:37:39,287
We may have done sod all with our
powers, but we never abused them.

514
00:37:39,288 --> 00:37:41,847
We never raped or murdered anyone.

515
00:37:41,848 --> 00:37:44,367
She raped me, and we
killed loads of people.

516
00:37:44,368 --> 00:37:46,247
OK. But we're the good guys.

517
00:37:46,248 --> 00:37:48,767
Every time we get anywhere near him,
he'll just fuck off somewhere else.

518
00:37:48,768 --> 00:37:51,407
We need our powers.
We can use this to buy them back.

519
00:37:51,408 --> 00:37:53,327
And then we're kicking
the shit out of Jesus!

520
00:37:53,328 --> 00:37:57,327
He's not Jesus, all right?

521
00:37:58,408 --> 00:38:00,807
This way.

522
00:38:00,808 --> 00:38:02,527
Should you be carrying
something heavy like this?

523
00:38:02,528 --> 00:38:06,527
I'm fine.

524
00:38:07,008 --> 00:38:08,207
I think that belongs to me.

525
00:38:08,208 --> 00:38:10,447
Come and get it
if you fucking want it.

526
00:38:10,448 --> 00:38:12,327
Back this way, back this way.

527
00:38:12,328 --> 00:38:14,607
If the mountain won't come
to Mohammed...

528
00:38:14,608 --> 00:38:18,607
Now he's starting on the Muslims!

529
00:38:45,648 --> 00:38:49,647
Ah, shit! We've killed Jesus!

530
00:38:53,288 --> 00:38:54,967
Just in case he really is Jesus.

531
00:38:54,968 --> 00:38:57,687
Our Lord has sacrificed himself,
again.

532
00:38:57,688 --> 00:39:01,207
He's not Jesus! He's just a
dickhead with a few super powers.

533
00:39:01,208 --> 00:39:03,367
Super powers?

534
00:39:03,368 --> 00:39:07,367
Do you really expect me
to believe that?

535
00:39:07,408 --> 00:39:09,007
Ah! Did you piss yourself again?

536
00:39:09,008 --> 00:39:13,007
My waters have broken.
The baby's coming... Ow!

537
00:39:16,808 --> 00:39:19,327
What do we do?

538
00:39:19,328 --> 00:39:21,247
Where's the fucking ambulance, mate?

539
00:39:21,248 --> 00:39:23,207
I've called it two times!

540
00:39:27,728 --> 00:39:30,607
You've got
to be fucking kidding me.

541
00:39:30,608 --> 00:39:32,927
Does anyone know anything about
delivering babies,

542
00:39:32,928 --> 00:39:34,487
because I think this is happening
right now...

543
00:39:34,488 --> 00:39:35,247
Hot towels!

544
00:39:35,248 --> 00:39:37,167
Hot towels!
Right!

545
00:39:37,168 --> 00:39:38,647
We haven't got any.

546
00:39:38,648 --> 00:39:39,687
Oh, you're a big fucking help(!)

547
00:39:39,688 --> 00:39:41,167
Where's the ambulance?

548
00:39:41,168 --> 00:39:42,447
- Oh, you're a big fucking help(!)
Where's the ambulance? - It's on its way!

549
00:39:42,448 --> 00:39:43,807
How close is it
to actually coming out?

550
00:39:43,808 --> 00:39:44,807
I don't know.
...How does it feel, baby?

551
00:39:44,808 --> 00:39:47,127
It feels like my cunt's
being ripped apart!

552
00:39:47,128 --> 00:39:49,767
I'm no expert,
but that sounds normal.

553
00:39:49,768 --> 00:39:53,767
Right.
I'm going down for a quick peak.

554
00:39:58,768 --> 00:40:02,167
There's a little baby
coming out of your twat!

555
00:40:02,168 --> 00:40:04,367
Me and Marnie talked about it,

556
00:40:04,368 --> 00:40:06,327
and we want all of you
to be the baby's godparents.

557
00:40:06,328 --> 00:40:07,887
She doesn't even know us.

558
00:40:07,888 --> 00:40:10,527
She hasn't got any other friends,
and neither have I.

559
00:40:10,528 --> 00:40:13,967
I told her there's no-one in the
world I trust more than you guys.

560
00:40:13,968 --> 00:40:15,207
You said that about us?

561
00:40:15,208 --> 00:40:18,127
Well, no, not really.
So what d'you say?

562
00:40:18,128 --> 00:40:20,847
Will you please shut the fuck up?!

563
00:40:20,848 --> 00:40:24,847
Sorry. Sorry.
Sorry, baby. Come on. Just push.

564
00:40:36,888 --> 00:40:40,887
Hello!

565
00:40:40,888 --> 00:40:44,887
He looks like me.

566
00:40:53,248 --> 00:40:56,367
Hey, there, little fella.

567
00:40:56,368 --> 00:40:58,367
It's OK. Daddy's here.

568
00:40:58,368 --> 00:41:02,367
# Little donkey, little donkey

569
00:41:04,328 --> 00:41:08,327
# On the dusky road

570
00:41:09,448 --> 00:41:13,447
# Gotta keep on plodding onwards

571
00:41:14,848 --> 00:41:18,847
# With your precious load

572
00:41:19,968 --> 00:41:23,967
# Been a long time, little donkey

573
00:41:25,008 --> 00:41:29,007
# Through the winter's night

574
00:41:29,688 --> 00:41:33,687
# Don't give up now, little donkey

575
00:41:34,928 --> 00:41:38,927
# Bethlehem's in sight

576
00:41:39,928 --> 00:41:43,927
# Ring out the bells tonight

577
00:41:45,408 --> 00:41:49,407
# Bethlehem, Bethlehem

578
00:41:50,648 --> 00:41:54,647
# Follow the star tonight

579
00:41:56,288 --> 00:42:00,287
# Bethlehem, Bethlehem. #

580
00:42:04,968 --> 00:42:07,007
You've seriously lost your cool.

581
00:42:07,008 --> 00:42:11,007
Oh, shut up. It's Christmas.

582
00:42:14,968 --> 00:42:18,967
Sorry, Jesus.

583
00:42:22,088 --> 00:42:24,687
I think I'm having another!
I think I'm having twins!

584
00:42:24,688 --> 00:42:27,407
What?! Jesus, Mary and Joseph!

585
00:42:27,408 --> 00:42:28,127
What is it?

586
00:42:28,128 --> 00:42:29,367
What is it?
You're giving birth to an alien!

587
00:42:29,368 --> 00:42:33,367
Get it out, get it out!

588
00:42:44,328 --> 00:42:48,327
It's the afterbirth, you dickhead!

589
00:43:02,488 --> 00:43:04,327
Anyway, so...

590
00:43:04,328 --> 00:43:08,327
happy Christmas, one and all.

591
00:43:34,648 --> 00:43:36,087
That is a fucking horrible jumper.

592
00:43:36,088 --> 00:43:40,087
Shut up. It was a Christmas present
from Marnie. That's very rude.

593
00:43:45,248 --> 00:43:47,847
Is there any reason why have
to have the same powers as before?

594
00:43:47,848 --> 00:43:50,927
Mine died with that Jesus guy.

595
00:43:50,928 --> 00:43:54,927
He said if we've got the money,
we can take our pick.

596
00:44:06,608 --> 00:44:10,607
OK.

597
00:44:14,488 --> 00:44:18,487
So who's first?

598
00:44:19,088 --> 00:44:23,087
You're all such pussies! I'll do it.

599
00:44:50,528 --> 00:44:54,527
