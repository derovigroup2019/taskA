1
00:00:01,940 --> 00:00:06,480
You can't die. I love you.
I'll still be here.

2
00:00:06,681 --> 00:00:08,759
Where did you get that?

3
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:09,838
The guy in the mask.

4
00:00:09,839 --> 00:00:10,560
Who is he?

5
00:00:10,561 --> 00:00:11,600
He's you.

6
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:14,719
So what happens now?

7
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:16,279
You fall in love with me.

8
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:18,959
(NATHAN) No more community service.

9
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:21,160
I thought we'd be all
celebrating and shit.

10
00:00:21,161 --> 00:00:24,479
All the shit we've been through.
We're all here,

11
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:26,119
all alive.

12
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:27,439
We made it.

13
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:29,759
I can give you your life back.

14
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:32,479
There's this guy. He took my power.

15
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:33,678
You sold your powers?

16
00:00:33,679 --> 00:00:34,718
Yeah, mate.

17
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:36,640
We were given them for a reason.

18
00:00:36,641 --> 00:00:39,359
Do we have to have
the same powers as before?

19
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:43,279
He said if we've got the money,
we can take our pick.

20
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:44,959
OK, so who's first?

21
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:47,560
You're all such pussies!
I'll do it.

22
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:00,599
POUNDING ON DOOR

23
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:03,519
Right. I need to speak to the...

24
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:05,800
cool, mysterious...

25
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:10,400
power guy. Is he, is he in?

26
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:31,600
What are you doing?

27
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:34,960
Get back in here!

28
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:49,840
Sorry!

29
00:01:49,841 --> 00:01:50,760
Wanker!

30
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:11,279
What the fuck...

31
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,840
do you think you're doing?

32
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:16,079
Think you can get rid of me?

33
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,120
I'm a part of you.

34
00:02:17,121 --> 00:02:19,719
Cool power guy with the suits,

35
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:21,638
he could've sorted
this bullshit out,

36
00:02:21,639 --> 00:02:23,238
but you had to make a big drama!

37
00:02:23,239 --> 00:02:25,720
I won't let you bury me.
I'm staying right here.

38
00:02:25,721 --> 00:02:28,039
You're such a whiney little bitch!

39
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:30,000
You hate me, you hate yourself.

40
00:02:30,001 --> 00:02:33,559
Nobody loves themselves more than I
do. I'd fuck myself in a heartbeat.

41
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:37,999
So we're back to the whole
"I'm gay" thing there, aren't we?

42
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,640
Why bring that up? I'm not gay.

43
00:02:39,641 --> 00:02:43,239
Remember that time in PE?
In the showers, you got turned on

44
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:45,320
watching Richard Saunders
soap his balls?

45
00:02:45,321 --> 00:02:46,959
Oh, he's pathetic! He's sad.

46
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:49,599
You thought about it
when screwing the fake vagina

47
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:51,280
you made out of Mum's rubber gloves.

48
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:00,600
You trying to fuck me?

49
00:03:00,601 --> 00:03:02,839
I'm gonna fucking kill you!

50
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:04,159
I am you!

51
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:05,560
You're nothing to do with me!

52
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,480
Rudy!

53
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,799
(GROANS)

54
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:26,559
That could've gone
horribly wrong, that.

55
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,200
You could have killed us.

56
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:33,560
Shut up whining.

57
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:40,599
C'mon.

58
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:41,878
Get in here.

59
00:03:41,879 --> 00:03:43,080
Whoa!

60
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:46,840
(CRACKS HIS BACK, GROANS)

61
00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:01,160
WHISTLING

62
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:29,240
(GROANS)

63
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:33,360
Argh.

64
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:36,840
You're not going to ask
about me limp?

65
00:06:36,841 --> 00:06:38,599
No.

66
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:41,959
No, of course not!
Cos that would be doing your job.

67
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:44,519
I'm not sure you're cut out
to be a probation worker.

68
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:45,358
Is that right?

69
00:06:45,359 --> 00:06:46,560
Yeah.

70
00:06:46,561 --> 00:06:49,519
If you're finished
with the careers advice,

71
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:52,280
piss off and pick up some litter
with the other shitheads.

72
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:00,280
Right.

73
00:07:00,281 --> 00:07:05,239
Before all the accusations,

74
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:07,319
recriminations start flying around,

75
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:09,879
before harmony turns to discord,

76
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:13,759
and everyone starts shouting,
jabbing their fingers at each other,

77
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:16,319
I just want to say for the record,
hand on heart,

78
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:19,399
the other hand on a Bible,

79
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:22,119
that it wasn't absolutely wasn't me

80
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:25,120
who left the big floater
in the toilet back there.

81
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:42,119
These are the designs for an
intercontinental ballistic missile.

82
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:43,399
Yeah, mate.

83
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:45,199
Check out the propulsion system.

84
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:47,200
It's liquid nitrogen. It's wicked.

85
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:49,520
Where did you get them?

86
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:52,039
I drew them.

87
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:54,439
(LAUGHS) You?

88
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:57,839
You honestly expect me
to believe that?

89
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:59,239
You think I nicked them?

90
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:01,319
I fucking drew them.
They're my designs!

91
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:02,920
Get her out of here.

92
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:06,559
Take your hand off me, you prick!

93
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:09,839
I'm a fucking rocket scientist!

94
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:11,680
DOOR SLAMS

95
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:45,919
LIFT DOOR OPENS

96
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:49,399
These new powers are bullshit.

97
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:51,919
I thought this power would make me
dead clever,

98
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:53,878
but all I know is
how to design rockets.

99
00:08:53,879 --> 00:08:54,840
Guess it does what it says
on the tin.

100
00:08:54,841 --> 00:08:56,999
Only there's no tin

101
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,639
or instructions. No-one believes
someone like me's a rocket scientist.

102
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:03,319
You don't exactly look
like a rocket scientist.

103
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:05,640
Maybe I should get some glasses,
to look dead intelligent.

104
00:09:05,641 --> 00:09:07,799
Yeah, that'll do it.

105
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:10,160
Simon?

106
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:12,720
Hey.

107
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,640
Hurry up and put some clothes on.

108
00:09:18,641 --> 00:09:20,280
I said we'd go or a drink.

109
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:31,560
? BLOOD RED SHOES:
It's Getting Boring By The Sea

110
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:35,359
Has anyone heard from Nathan?

111
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:37,438
He's in Vegas
with Marnie and Nathan Jr.

112
00:09:37,439 --> 00:09:39,440
They want us to go over
for the weddings.

113
00:09:39,441 --> 00:09:42,359
I'll go, if that prick pays
for my flights and my hotel.

114
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:45,639
He's going to use his power
to cheat money out of the casino.

115
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:47,760
You don't need to be able
to see the future

116
00:09:47,761 --> 00:09:50,799
to know that's going to end badly.

117
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:53,039
The baby's really cute, though.

118
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:56,239
I think she's getting broody, mate.
Better knock her up.

119
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,800
Garcon!

120
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:03,400
Talking to me?

121
00:10:03,401 --> 00:10:06,439
I believe so. It's French.

122
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:08,158
You're not a fan of the French?

123
00:10:08,159 --> 00:10:09,400
Fair enough.

124
00:10:09,401 --> 00:10:13,400
I don't like the cunts either. Can I
have three pints of lager, please?

125
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:19,399
What's wrong?

126
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:20,558
Nothing.

127
00:10:20,559 --> 00:10:22,040
I'm knackered. Can we go?

128
00:10:22,041 --> 00:10:23,919
I'll come with you.

129
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:25,240
Later.

130
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,479
I'm away for a cigarette.

131
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:30,400
Good for you.

132
00:10:30,401 --> 00:10:33,559
I just want you to know, right,

133
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:36,639
out of the two of you,
I like you the best.

134
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:38,118
I mean, she's all right.

135
00:10:38,119 --> 00:10:39,678
She's not ugly or anything.

136
00:10:39,679 --> 00:10:41,478
Maybe a six or seven out of ten.

137
00:10:41,479 --> 00:10:42,440
So what am I?

138
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:46,558
I would never disrespect you
like that, or any woman,

139
00:10:46,559 --> 00:10:48,200
but if I absolutely had to,

140
00:10:48,201 --> 00:10:50,559
I'd give you a nine.

141
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:52,000
So, mathematically,

142
00:10:52,001 --> 00:10:56,199
as the two most... attractive members
of our Community Service gang,

143
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:59,118
I believe we are genetically
predisposed to copulate.

144
00:10:59,119 --> 00:11:00,800
Any reputable scientist
would tell you that, love.

145
00:11:00,801 --> 00:11:04,199
Well, I'm obviously
incredibly flattered...

146
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:06,319
Thank you.

147
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:09,399
It's just, I don't find you
even remotely attractive.

148
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:10,560
I don't believe you.

149
00:11:10,561 --> 00:11:12,159
Why would I lie?

150
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:13,280
I don't know. Why would you lie?

151
00:11:13,281 --> 00:11:14,559
I'm not.

152
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:16,080
Not consciously,

153
00:11:16,081 --> 00:11:20,399
just subconsciously, you're fucking
crazy about me. Aren't you?

154
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:21,600
To be continued.

155
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:25,960
Thank you.

156
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:31,559
She just totally knocked you back.

157
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:33,639
She's playing hard to get, mate.

158
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:36,679
She's out of your league.
She's laughing her arse off at you.

159
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:39,759
You can't go back in there.

160
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:41,078
You're gonna have to...

161
00:11:41,079 --> 00:11:43,400
Oh, climb through the window!
Just go. C'mon.

162
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:47,839
No! You'd love that, wouldn't you?

163
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:49,080
Why don't I just go home

164
00:11:49,081 --> 00:11:51,280
and spend the rest of
the night torturing

165
00:11:51,281 --> 00:11:53,479
myself about things I
did when I was like 14?

166
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:55,680
You mean the thing
with the neighbour's cat?

167
00:11:55,681 --> 00:11:57,279
No!

168
00:11:57,280 --> 00:12:00,280
We do not talk about that! Right?

169
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:02,839
Where are you going?

170
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:05,079
Just fuck the fuck off.

171
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:06,560
Wait for me outside.

172
00:12:06,561 --> 00:12:09,040
Honestly, you're a miserable prick.

173
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:17,640
So...

174
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,799
I believe you were just saying
how you, uh,

175
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:27,759
wanted to have sex with me?

176
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:29,360
What's that all about?

177
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:33,560
Oh!
(LAUGHS NERVOUSLY)

178
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:40,279
Oh, no, ta, you're all right.

179
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:43,959
I'm genetically predisposed
to get cancer.

180
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:45,398
I think I'll pass.

181
00:12:45,399 --> 00:12:47,120
If you don't smoke,
why are you out here?

182
00:12:47,121 --> 00:12:49,199
I'm sick of all the wankers in there

183
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,278
acting like they're
having a good time.

184
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:53,758
So how come you're on
Community Service?

185
00:12:53,759 --> 00:12:55,278
What've you done?

186
00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:57,120
Oh, c'mon, what's your crime?

187
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:01,919
I was with my boyfriend,
and we got stopped by the police.

188
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:04,318
He put the drugs he was carrying
in my bag.

189
00:13:04,319 --> 00:13:06,798
I saw him, but I didn't
have time to do anything.

190
00:13:06,799 --> 00:13:08,120
You're kidding.

191
00:13:08,121 --> 00:13:11,879
No-one's ever going to do
anything like that to me again.

192
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:15,280
People will shit all over you
any chance they get, won't they?

193
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:20,439
I had you all wrong.

194
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:21,440
I thought you were
a shallow little prick.

195
00:13:21,441 --> 00:13:24,279
No, it's an act. It's a front.

196
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:26,120
I'm deeply insecure.

197
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:31,719
Do you want to...

198
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:33,000
go somewhere, just us?

199
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:39,079
Let's stay here. We're just getting
to know each other, aren't we?

200
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:40,160
We'll talk in there.

201
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:45,320
Hey.

202
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:48,640

? I'm crazy for feeling so lonely

206
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:13,839
? I'm crazy

207
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:18,560
? Crazy for feeling... ?

210
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:34,440
? You'd love me as long as you wanted

211
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:39,200
? And then someday

212
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:46,840
? You'd leave me for somebody new

213
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:52,520
? Worry

214
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:59,040
? Why do I let myself worry?

215
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:07,639
? Wonderin'

216
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:14,640
? What in the world did I do... ?

217
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:19,399
What happened?

218
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:20,518
Ah!

219
00:15:20,519 --> 00:15:21,920
You've... you've bottled me!

220
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:23,439
What are you talking about?

221
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:24,760
This man just bottled me!

222
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:27,278
I didn't do anything to you!

223
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:28,598
Me face!

224
00:15:28,599 --> 00:15:30,360
Am I still, am I still gorgeous?

225
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:37,278
Whoa. Whoa, whoa.

226
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:39,779
Do you know
how rare it is to find a girl

227
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:42,759
His head's cut up. I'm standing
with a broken bottle.

228
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:44,440
I don't remember doing anything.

229
00:15:44,441 --> 00:15:46,479
That is definitely some power shit.

230
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:48,119
What are we going to do?

231
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:51,639
We don't have to do anything. Keep
our heads down and stay out of it.

232
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:52,840
Cos that always works.

233
00:15:52,841 --> 00:15:55,760
This is the kind of shit where
we need that guy in the mask.

234
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:58,959
Why do we always get involved?

235
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:02,440
Can't we do normal stuff that normal
people do, like... go for brunch?

236
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:07,039
What the fuck is brunch?

237
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:10,520
? THE VELVET UNDERGROUND:
Sunday Morning

238
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:21,279

239
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:24,120
? Brings the dawn in

240
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:29,560
? It's just a restless feeling... ?

241
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:33,239
Would you like a bacon sandwich?

242
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:37,039
I would like that... very much.

243
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:38,320
Thank you.

244
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:44,959
You've just had unprotected
anal sex with that girl.

245
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:47,198
I most certainly did.
And she loved it.

246
00:16:47,199 --> 00:16:48,400
What if she's got HIV?

247
00:16:48,401 --> 00:16:51,279
Cute girls don't get HIV.

248
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:54,159
You need to take her to a clinic,
get her to have some tests,

249
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:55,640
get her a full work-up.

250
00:16:55,641 --> 00:16:57,159
Whoa. Whoa, whoa.

251
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:59,679
Do you know
how rare it is to find a girl

252
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:03,239
who genuinely, honest to God,
absolutely loves it up the arse?

253
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:04,600
Urgh.

254
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:09,159
Can you smell that?

255
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:11,959
That's bacon, gently sizzling
in the pan there.

256
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:14,238
Life doesn't get any better
than this for me!

257
00:17:14,239 --> 00:17:16,600
It's as close to heaven
as I'm gonna get.

258
00:17:16,601 --> 00:17:20,399
If you don't get her
to have those tests, I will.

259
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:24,119
Don't go near her, do you hear me?
She doesn't need to see this shit.

260
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:27,799
I think she does. In fact, I'll go
tell her to stick some more bacon on,

261
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:29,480
cos that's three for breakfast.

262
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:33,118

Yeah, I'm fine. I'm just
washing shit off me cock.

266
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:40,518
I'm going to tell her everything.

267
00:17:40,519 --> 00:17:43,000

little secrets.

268
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:46,839

What're you doing in there?

271
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:52,280
Nothing.

272
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:58,919
Rudy!

273
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:01,240
Just a minute! Just a minute, yeah?

274
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:04,119
Ow!

275
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:06,120
Fuck!

276
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:09,760
What happened?

277
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:14,639
Funny thing. You know how I said
I was washing me cock?

278
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:18,119
I slipped on the soap
and impaled meself on some scissors!

279
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:20,919
How mad's that shit?

280
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:23,800
Actually really fucking hurts, like.

281
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,159
So is this like brunch?

282
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:33,879
Cos it feels like I'm just
eating a bacon sandwich?

283
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:36,720
Hey. That's him. That's the guy
who said I bottled him.

284
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:41,119
What are you smiling at?

285
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,440
A gentleman never tells.

286
00:18:42,441 --> 00:18:45,319
I've just fucked her up the arse!

287
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:49,039
Everything you said?
It was all bullshit!

288
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:50,120
How could you do that to me?

289
00:18:50,121 --> 00:18:54,119
But I didn't do it to you ...
I did it to her.

290
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:56,120
I'm the arse man.
King of the world!

291
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:00,800

You're that crazy barman
who bottled me.

295
00:19:16,641 --> 00:19:18,199
I didn't bottle you.

296
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:19,480
It must have been her.

00:19:19,481 --> 00:19:21,160

thought you were someone else.

No. I got away. I...

311
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:55,759
I did my thing.

(LAUGHS) Brilliant.

319
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:35,080
So this turning into a girl thing,

320
00:21:35,081 --> 00:21:37,919
is it born out of
some sort of sexual confusion?

321

There ain't no sexual confusion.

It's her.

360
00:24:44,161 --> 00:24:46,160
There's this girl on the estate.

361
00:24:46,161 --> 00:24:48,879
She used a power to make it look
like we trashed a car.

362
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:49,880
The police are after us.

363
00:24:49,881 --> 00:24:52,759
And you're telling me because...?

364
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:55,799
I thought you could do something.
Take her power or something.

365
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:57,080
Oh, did you?

366
00:24:57,081 --> 00:24:59,879
I'll just find my cape and tights
and get on it.

367
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:02,200
You think this is funny?
D'you see me laughing?

368
00:25:02,201 --> 00:25:03,999
I've never seen you smile.

369
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,279
You always sit there with a massive
shit-eating grin on your face.

370
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:09,360
Mister Fucking Happy!

371
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:15,880
Look, are you going to do something
about this girl or not?

372
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:20,519
I really don't see that happening.

373
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:22,718
You don't give a shit about anyone,
do you?

374
00:25:22,719 --> 00:25:24,120
I give a shit about me.

375
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:29,358
And just so you know,
this new power?

376
00:25:29,359 --> 00:25:30,560
It's rubbish.

377
00:25:30,561 --> 00:25:32,079
But you're a rocket scientist.

378
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:33,680
Yeah, and you're a dick!

took the dog?

384
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:02,720
What dog? Was there even a dog?

385
00:26:02,721 --> 00:26:05,119
The charity box, for the blind?

the fuck it was. Who nicked it?

Who took it?

390
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:20,399
Right.

391
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:22,119
I really hate to be a grass,

392
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:25,239
but I did see
that strangely intense girl

393
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:28,679
with slightly inadequate breasts ...
she was carrying something heavy

394
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:31,239

over to her locker before...

It's number 43.

00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:39,280
Ow.

00:26:57,760 --> 00:26:59,079

The probation worker's
looking for you.

401
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:09,598
And why's that?

402
00:27:09,599 --> 00:27:11,838
Because he seems to be
under the impression

403
00:27:11,839 --> 00:27:14,080
that you've stolen
a dog-shaped charity box,

404
00:27:14,081 --> 00:27:16,639
on account of him having
found it in your locker.

405
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:18,079
Mm!

You know what?
I think about loads of things.

431

I think about shagging supermodels.

I think about shagging
normal models.

ever again. What d'you say?

533
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:53,919
You could move to Wales,

534
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:56,159
I've no fucking intention
of going there!

535
00:34:56,160 --> 00:34:58,799
So you can walk around like
you're happy all the time?

536
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:00,199
It works for me.

537
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:03,919
I don't need you turning up
every time I feel down,

538
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:06,559
reminding me of everything that
makes me feel shit about myself.

539
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:08,679
But it's a part of who you are...

540
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:13,319
No. It's a part of who you are.
All this fighting, arguing.

541
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:16,639
Nobody wants to get stabbed in the
shoulder with a pair of scissors.

542
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:19,080
It's not cool,
and it hurts.

543
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:23,880
C'mon, man.
Let's just stay split.

544
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:38,159
I'm going to take
your moody silence as a "yes".

545
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:40,560
Try not to break another window
on your way out.

546
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:06,920
Jesus!

547
00:37:06,921 --> 00:37:10,439
I thought you were
at the police station...?

548
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:11,800
The police are going to have

549
00:37:11,801 --> 00:37:14,520
a lot more important things to do
than look for me.

550
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:54,280
Oh, Jesus.

551
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:00,440
It wasn't me...

552
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:08,479
What did you do...?

553
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:09,880
I didn't do anything.

554
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:51,840
Oh!

555
00:38:51,841 --> 00:38:53,440
Jesus! Shit!

556
00:38:58,040 --> 00:38:59,280
Well, this isn't good, is it?

557
00:38:59,281 --> 00:39:01,599
Why's she doing this?

558
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:03,879
I honestly have no idea.

559
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:06,239
I'll find out where she is.

560
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:09,039
Oh, brilliant. We'll just untie
your hands, slip off the noose,

561
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:10,160
and away you go.

562
00:39:10,161 --> 00:39:13,919
No ... my power! I can put myself
in other people's shoes.

563
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:15,720
See what they see
through their eyes.

564
00:39:15,721 --> 00:39:18,119
Do you have to be
wearing their shoes?

565
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:21,240
No. Right. That'd be
ridiculous, wouldn't it?

566
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:33,720
She's writing our suicide notes!

567
00:39:33,721 --> 00:39:36,160
Fuck...

568
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:42,559
You don't have to do this!

569
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:45,599
Well, someone's going to get
blamed for stabbing Charlie.

570
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:47,639
And it's not going to be me.

571
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:49,880
What if we promise
not to tell anyone...?

572
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:54,799
But... if this is suicide,

573
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:58,639
how d'you explain our hands
being tied behind our backs?

574
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:00,999
I'll untie them when you're dead.

575
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,759
Hm. I'm glad you've
thought of everything.

576
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:07,000
Or should I say,
nearly everything?

577
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:09,640
No, you're bluffing.

578
00:40:09,641 --> 00:40:10,799
Am I?

579
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:12,239
Yeah!

580
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:14,280
I really wouldn't do that
if I were you. It's up to you.

581
00:40:14,281 --> 00:40:16,959
Ooh, the irony.

582
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:18,000
You're gonna kick yourself.

583
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:21,638
What the fuck are you talking about?

584
00:40:21,639 --> 00:40:22,758
It's hilarious. It's too funny.

585
00:40:22,759 --> 00:40:23,880
What is it?

586
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:26,918
Tell me!

587
00:40:26,919 --> 00:40:27,960
All right. It's this...

588
00:40:36,080 --> 00:40:37,679
Rudy!

589
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:38,880
Wrap your legs round me.

590
00:40:38,881 --> 00:40:42,319
I'll take your weight! Wrap
your legs around me! Come on!

591
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:44,439
I didn't mean to kill her!

592
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:45,598
You can't hold us...

593
00:40:45,599 --> 00:40:46,800
Just hold on.

594
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:50,799
No point in us both dying.

595
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:52,160
Just hold on!

596
00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:54,559
You broke my heart...

597
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:56,119
I know.

598
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:58,479
I lied.

599
00:40:58,480 --> 00:40:59,520
I do remember you.

600
00:41:01,240 --> 00:41:04,599
I was a bitch. I didn't care
who I hurt, but I've changed.

601
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:08,519
I'm not that person any more!

602
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:11,879
I hate myself for
what I did to you.

603
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:12,960
I'm sorry.

604
00:41:12,961 --> 00:41:15,120
That's good enough.

605
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:18,839
No! Rudy!

606
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:20,760
Rudy! Help!

607
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:23,919
Somebody help us...!

608
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:26,000
SCREAMS FADE

609
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:55,360
I thought you'd gone
to Wales?

610
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:07,759
I've got to tell you, guys ...
I'm kind of freaking out here,

611
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:11,119
all this killing
and burying and dying.

612
00:42:11,120 --> 00:42:13,479
Just, I'm outside
my comfort zone.

613
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:16,600
If it makes you feel any better,
we've done a couple of people too.

614
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:20,599
Shit just happened.

615
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:22,320
You bury 'em,
just get on with your life.

616
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:29,159
I just... keep seeing this image
of her cute little face,

617
00:42:29,160 --> 00:42:32,480
she's biting down
on the mattress, there.

618
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:36,240
She absolutely loved it
up the arse.

619
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:40,440
God rest her beautiful soul.

620
00:42:42,080 --> 00:42:43,480
Amen.

621
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:02,679
Well, that could've
gone a lot worse, you know?

622
00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:04,280
For me.

623
00:43:05,360 --> 00:43:06,719
A new day tomorrow.

624
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:09,039
Who knows what it holds
for all of us.

625
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:11,119
SIREN WAILS

626
00:43:11,120 --> 00:43:12,159
Shit...

627
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:13,080
Just stay cool.

628
00:43:13,081 --> 00:43:16,079
Don't get upset,
but this isn't exactly my car.

629
00:43:16,080 --> 00:43:16,640
Whose car is it?

630
00:43:16,641 --> 00:43:18,239
Nicked it off a man with a perm.

631
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:21,159
A man, with a perm.
What's that about?

632
00:43:21,160 --> 00:43:24,479
We can't get caught in no nicked
car. We're all on probation.

633
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:27,000
Maybe they'll let you off
with a warning, love.

634
00:43:30,200 --> 00:43:31,759
Honestly, guys...

635
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:35,159
I thought they'd let you off
with a warning.

636
00:43:35,160 --> 00:43:37,400
SLOW HANDCLAP

637
00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:48,479
That didn't take you long,
did it? Congratulations.

638
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:51,039
You haven't changed.

639
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:55,679
That's where you're wrong, because
I've found a new dedication

640
00:43:55,680 --> 00:44:00,040
to ensuring your complete
and total rehabilitation.

641
00:44:01,960 --> 00:44:04,799
I'll get started, right after I've
watched Homes Under the Hammer.

642
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:06,720
Ooh! Can we watch that
with you?

643
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:12,479
You lot can piss off
and do some work.

644
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:13,560
Chop chop.

645
00:44:47,080 --> 00:44:48,118
What you doing?

646
00:44:48,119 --> 00:44:50,000
Designing a new
propulsion system.

647
00:44:50,001 --> 00:44:51,039
Why?

648
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:53,839
Because I'm a fucking
rocket scientist.

649
00:44:53,840 --> 00:44:57,039
Ah, are we doing catchphrases?

650
00:44:57,040 --> 00:45:01,079
Maybe we could all have one.
Mine could be, "Now you see me,

651
00:45:01,080 --> 00:45:02,719
"Now you see two of me".

652
00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:04,279
Why do we need catchphrases?

653
00:45:04,280 --> 00:45:06,840
You know ... for when
shit goes down, man.

654
00:45:09,160 --> 00:45:12,399
C'mon. D'you really think we're
going to spend the next seven weeks

655
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:14,038
ambling around,
picking up litter?

656
00:45:14,039 --> 00:45:15,080
He's got a point.

657
00:45:15,081 --> 00:45:17,879
Maybe it'll be different
this time.

658
00:45:17,880 --> 00:45:20,559
Maybe there won't be
any shit going down.

659
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:23,239
Oh, trust me.
There'll be shit.

660
00:45:23,240 --> 00:45:24,720
It's in the air.

661
00:45:27,480 --> 00:45:29,160
I can smell it.

662
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:46,200
So do you want to tell me
what's going on?

663
00:45:46,201 --> 00:45:48,839
Why are we following him?
Oh, my God.

664
00:45:48,840 --> 00:45:50,280
You fancy him!

665
00:45:50,281 --> 00:45:52,719
You're Curtis Donovan,
aren't you?

666
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:53,598
So what is there to do
round here?

667
00:45:53,599 --> 00:45:54,838
Have you just had a shag?

668
00:45:54,839 --> 00:45:56,158
Something like that.

669
00:45:56,159 --> 00:45:57,878
Who's the lucky girl?

670
00:45:57,879 --> 00:45:59,240
You don't know her.

671
00:45:59,241 --> 00:46:01,279
This was the worst sex
I have ever had.

672
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:04,359
When we were together,
was I...?

673
00:46:04,360 --> 00:46:05,760
What? Was I shit?

674
00:46:05,761 --> 00:46:08,279
What are you doing?
That's Curtis's locker.

675
00:46:08,280 --> 00:46:10,599
It's me, Curtis.

676
00:46:10,600 --> 00:46:12,320
This is how I look
when I'm a girl.

677
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:48,880
