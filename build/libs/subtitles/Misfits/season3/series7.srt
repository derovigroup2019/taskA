00:42:32,920 --> 00:42:35,439
 When you're like me,
he won't want you either!

537
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:38,440
Get away from her!

538
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:40,919
What are you going to do?

539
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:43,920
Are you going to kill me again?!

540
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:47,800
I love you!

541
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:50,439
And I loved you.

542
00:42:50,440 --> 00:42:53,440
But after I brought you back,
 it was different.

543
00:42:54,120 --> 00:42:57,120
I'd changed.

544
00:42:57,640 --> 00:43:00,559
I love someone else.

545
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:02,359
You bastard.

546
00:43:02,360 --> 00:43:04,919
I'm sorry.

547
00:43:04,920 --> 00:43:07,920
(SCREAMS)

548
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:20,520
Did you mean what you just said to her?

549
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:24,479
Yeah.

550
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:27,480
 Good, cos I fucking love you too. Just
don't ever do anything like that again.

551
00:43:28,040 --> 00:43:31,040
I won't.

552
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:49,200
We just want you to know that, um...

553
00:43:50,840 --> 00:43:53,840
...this isn't our fault.
We're... in the wrong place...

554
00:43:56,680 --> 00:43:59,599
... at the wrong time.

555
00:43:59,600 --> 00:44:02,600
A lot.

556
00:44:04,040 --> 00:44:06,159
We're really not bad kids.

557
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:08,439
Yeah.

558
00:44:08,440 --> 00:44:11,440
# In tribute to all things petite

559
00:44:13,840 --> 00:44:16,840
# Pretty and sweet

560
00:44:18,040 --> 00:44:21,040
# The lonely doll

561
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:26,520
# This verse I offer and greet

562
00:44:28,120 --> 00:44:31,120
# In desire to replete

563
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:35,040
# The lonely doll. #

564
00:44:39,720 --> 00:44:41,599
We did it.

565
00:44:41,600 --> 00:44:44,600
We stopped the zombies infecting everyone.

566
00:44:45,240 --> 00:44:47,399
I can't believe we didn't screw that up!

567
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:50,119
Are you actually saying
 we saved the world?

568
00:44:50,120 --> 00:44:52,119
We saved the world.

569
00:44:52,120 --> 00:44:55,120
That is proper superhero shit.

570
00:44:55,280 --> 00:44:57,639
Oh, yeah. Yeah, it is!

571
00:44:57,640 --> 00:45:00,640
Eh? And I think I'm over my old
cheerleader phobia, you know -

572
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:03,799
 that brutal killing's
been really cathartic.

573
00:45:03,800 --> 00:45:05,359
Actually, if we hadn't killed 'em all,

574
00:45:05,360 --> 00:45:07,679
I think I could've brought myself
 to fuck one of 'em.

575
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:10,680
Which is nice, so...

576
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:20,760
What happened to Mr Miggles?

577
00:45:21,160 --> 00:45:24,160
Oh, shit!

578
00:45:26,280 --> 00:45:29,280
I'm getting a message from the spirit
 world. It's for you...

579
00:45:29,320 --> 00:45:32,320
She's crying. She wants to know why...

580
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:35,479
why you did it.

581
00:45:35,480 --> 00:45:37,239
You're supposed to be dead.

582
00:45:37,240 --> 00:45:39,239
I think I've come back for you.

583
00:45:39,240 --> 00:45:40,279
What is it?

584
00:45:40,280 --> 00:45:42,199
I'd never do anything to hurt you.

585
00:45:42,200 --> 00:45:43,719
Why do they come back?

586
00:45:43,720 --> 00:45:46,279
 Usually it's cos they've got some
unfinished business with the living.

587
00:45:46,280 --> 00:45:47,319
What is this?

588
00:45:47,320 --> 00:45:48,799
Isn't that the girl who brainwashed us?

589
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:50,479
Would you like to see my penis?

590
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:53,480
It's the probation worker. He's come back
 from the dead! He's just chased me!

591
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:55,199
