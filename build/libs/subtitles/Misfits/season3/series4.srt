I think you'd better read this.

364
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:58,209
The Nazis
weren't supposed to win the war.

365
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:00,402
This isn't supposed to happen.

366
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:05,881
Take the power.

367
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:09,761
I'm too weak to do anything with it.

368
00:34:11,160 --> 00:34:13,811
You have to put it right.

369
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:23,044

371
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:53,565
So you have the power?

372
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:55,807
And now, you can put it back in him.

373
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:57,683
He's just taken it out of him.

374
00:34:57,720 --> 00:35:00,883
We can't afford for anyone
to have this power.

375
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:02,160
Too much could change.

376
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,411
It dies with the old man.

377
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:06,771
I won't do it.

378
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:19,326
Shoot him.

379
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:25,571
Shoot the old man.

380
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:37,089
Take out your side arm, and shoot him.

381
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:42,486
That is a direct order!

382
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:52,411
Take your fucking gun out and shoot him!

384
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:19,331
Get him out.

Take your fucking hands off me.

386
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:30,365
Leave him alone!

387
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:37,324
Put the power in him.

388
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:45,009
I will shoot...

389
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:48,123

390
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:50,606

391
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:52,688
Don't do it.

392
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:54,609
I'm sorry.

393

394

395
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:38,486
They shot them.

396
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:41,325
Right in front of me.

397
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:44,130
I just stood there.

398
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:47,045
I did nothing.

399
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:49,686
There's nothing you could have done.

and I'll kill anyone who gets in my way.

After everything I've done for you.

- He's...

He's dead.

to travel through time.
