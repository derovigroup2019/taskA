1
00:00:00,195 --> 00:00:01,754
What the fuck is going on?

2
00:00:02,383 --> 00:00:04,462
Since when did you
jump off buildings?

3
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:06,879
Since I travelled
back from the future.

4
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:08,359
'So what happens now?'

5
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:10,039
'You fall in love with me.'

6
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:14,959
You can't die, I love you.

7
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:16,759
I'll still be here.

8
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:18,839
Where did you get that?

9
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:19,679
The guy in the mask.

10
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:20,719
Who is he?

11
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:22,839
It's you.

12
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:26,839
All that matters is us, here, now.

13
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:02,079
Give me your phone.

14
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:04,559
Come on, come on. I ain't got
all fucking day!

15
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:07,879
Come on! Give it over!

16
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:11,879
I'll fucking hurt you, man.

17
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:19,799
Who the fuck are you?

18
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:21,399
Let him go.

19
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:22,879
Stay there.

20
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:25,799
What's with the mask?

21
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:28,919
Look at this shit.

22
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:32,919
You look like a dick.

23
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:37,039
Now then...

24
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:41,039
Let's have a look at you.

25
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:56,359
You're a superhero.

26
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:59,439
Look, I know you can't tell me
who you are.

27
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:03,439
That's why you have a secret
identity, right?

28
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:05,839
It's a bit cheesy, but...

29
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:09,839
can I get a photograph
of us together?

30
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:17,959
Shit. It's broken.

31
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,679
Simon?

32
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:43,319
Simon!

33
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:44,679
What happened?

34
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:48,679
Someone stamped on my hand.

35
00:02:48,704 --> 00:02:51,204
<font color="#3333FF">Subtitles by Red Bee Media Ltd, MemoryOnSmells</font>
<font color="#3333FF">www.addic7ed.com</font>

36
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:32,279
I did it.

37
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:34,799
I actually saved someone.

38
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,719
I didn't think I could do it.

39
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,679
But you could've been
seriously hurt.

40
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:42,679
If I don't take risks,
I'll never learn.

41
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:45,799
I'll never become him.

42
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:48,399
Why are you so obsessed
with becoming him?

43
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,399
I have to save you.

44
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:53,279
You don't have to do anything.
You already saved me.

45
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,239
I'll always save you.

46
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:58,359
It's like you're excited about it.

47
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:01,039
If you become him,
you're going to leave me.

48
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:04,799
You're going to travel back in time
and you're going to die.

49
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:08,799
And if I don't become him and travel
back in time, you're going to die.

50
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:12,239
I can't die in the past
if I'm alive in the present.

51
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:15,599
I don't know anything about this
Terminator time travel bullshit,

52
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:19,599
but even I know that.

53
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:23,159
You're going to stay here with me.

54
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:26,559
Because you can dress it up
anyway you like,

55
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,999
but if you travel back in time,
you're dumping me.

56
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,159
And I don't get dumped.

57
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,799
So it's not going to happen.
OK?

58
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:36,159
I didn't mean to upset you.

59
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:40,159
I'm sorry.

60
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:42,999
How does it feel?

61
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,519
It hurts.

62
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:48,519
Good.

63
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:57,239
What's going on?

64
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:00,079
Probation worker told us
to put them out. Some bollocks.

65
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:01,559
I think we're playing
musical chairs, man.

66
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:02,999
Yeah, seems likely.

67
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,239
Probation worker's
big on party games.

68
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:06,999
Maybe he's changed.

69
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,519
Right, you sacks of shit.
Here they are.

70
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:10,599
Who are they?

71
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,439
Another bunch of fuck-ups.

72
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:16,439
Right, everyone grab a seat.

73
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:20,519
The sooner we start,
the sooner we can all fuck off.

74
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:23,239
What is this?

75
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:26,279
Er, it's called
"Preventative Intervention".

76
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:27,679
Sounds kinky, dunnit?

77
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,719
Oh! Jesus!

78
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:32,799
OK. They're going to tell you
how they fucked up

79
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:35,119
and you tell them
how not to fuck up again

80
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:37,199
so they don't end up as big
a fuck-ups as you.

81
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:38,759
You think you can manage that?

82
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:40,719
Who's he calling a fuck-up there?

83
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:44,559
Right, who's first?

84
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:48,519
You. You're up.

85
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:51,199
Well go on.

86
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:52,559
My name's...

87
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,159
No-one cares.

88
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:56,479
Just get on with it.

89
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:59,719
There's this girl I like.

90
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:02,599
She was in a club.

91
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:04,599
I pretended to steal her handbag.

92
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:06,759
Why would you pretend
to steal her bag?

93
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:08,399
So I could give it back to her.

94
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:11,959
Cos girls love it
when you steal their bags, yeah?!

95
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:15,959
Do you want me to read it from
the file? Cos it's all in here.

96
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:19,799
I thought, if I stole it,

97
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:22,839
and I said that
I caught the guy who took it...

98
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:36,599
Sorry, mate. Go on. I thought you'd
finished. I thought he'd finished.

99
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:40,599
You were saying something about
a chicken. Or summat?

100
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:44,119
Why would I be
daydreaming about a chicken?

101
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:45,599
Go on.

102
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:49,599
I'm dying to hear how this
thrilling story ends!

103
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:54,159
I thought if I got her
her bag back...

104
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:56,319
I thought...

105
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:58,999
I thought I'd be a hero.

106
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,599
Jesus Christ.

107
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:03,199
All right, yes. Whatever.

108
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:05,639
Any pearls of wisdom
for him, help him out?

109
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:09,239
Don't go round stealing
other people's handbags.

110
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:12,079
Brilliant.

111
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:14,879
Right, you're done.

112
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:18,879
OK, tubs. You're next.

113
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:33,679
It won't be like this forever.

114
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,479
You'll meet a girl who likes you.

115
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:39,479
You won't have to steal her bag.

116
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:44,999
You're the guy in the mask.

117
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,839
I don't know what you're
talking about.

118
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:51,839
It's you. I recognise your voice.
The cut on your hand.

119
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:54,959
You can't tell anyone.

120
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:57,399
No-one can know.

121
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:59,439
I won't. I won't tell anyone.

122
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:01,439
How did you become a superhero?

123
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,439
I want to know everything.

124
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:07,119
We should go for a beer.

125
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:09,879
That isn't a good idea.

126
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:13,879
I think it's best you just
forget you ever met me.

127
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:18,879
Woah, hey! Ho ho ho!

128
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:22,879
Brilliant.

129
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,679
Glad you and your boyfriend
have finished.

130
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:34,799
I hope you've washed your hands,
and your genitals.

131
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:35,759
I'm not gay.

132
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:39,719
So you were showing each
other your cocks because..?

133
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:42,759
We were just... looking...

134
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:43,999
At each other's cocks.

135
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,759
It's a perfect...

136
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:49,599
Oh... It's a perfectly natural,

137
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:52,719
everyday part of being a gay man.

138
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,999
It's like window shopping.

139
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,999
Window shopping.

140
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:01,679
We didn't have sex. I'm not gay.

141
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:04,839
I didn't say anything.

142
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:05,879
What's this?

143
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:09,879
I don't know. What is that?
What is it?

144
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:12,879
It's fucking.

145
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:16,559
Is it?

146
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:59,239
Hi.

147
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:00,559
Hi.

148
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:04,559
I bought my first Superman comic
when I was five.

149
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:07,479
And after that, I was hooked.

150
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:11,079
My life was so boring and normal.

151
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:13,799
Suddenly, there were all these
incredible people,

152
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:17,199
with these amazing powers,
doing incredible things.

153
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:21,199
I used to spend hours making up
stories, doing the artwork.

154
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:25,319
I've always been obsessed with
superheroes.

155
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:29,319
Now I've actually met one.

156
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:32,879
I'm not sure I'm really a superhero.

157
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:36,079
You wear a costume
and you jump off buildings

158
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:38,319
and you save people from muggers.
Trust me,

159
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:42,239
that makes you a superhero.

160
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:44,359
Most people would think
I was a freak.

161
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:45,959
Those people are idiots.

162
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:49,959
They don't understand what it means,
to be prepared to risk your life.

163
00:10:51,110 --> 00:10:55,109
To be prepared to die
for what you believe in.

164
00:10:58,470 --> 00:11:01,829
Would you like to be my best friend?

165
00:11:01,830 --> 00:11:02,716
Great.

166
00:11:32,967 --> 00:11:33,686
What's up with him?

167
00:11:33,687 --> 00:11:35,126
Hmm...

168
00:11:35,127 --> 00:11:38,246
He thinks he's got cancer.

169
00:11:38,247 --> 00:11:41,126
Wait, if he has cancer,
won't you have cancer?

170
00:11:41,127 --> 00:11:43,606
No. Because he doesn't have cancer.

171
00:11:43,607 --> 00:11:45,846
There's something new every week.

172
00:11:45,847 --> 00:11:47,766
He's like the boy who cried
"tumour".

173
00:11:47,767 --> 00:11:50,166
I have a lump. Feel it.

174
00:11:50,167 --> 00:11:53,366
I don't want to finger fuck
your armpit, I think I'll pass.

175
00:11:59,567 --> 00:12:03,566
Woah!

176
00:12:04,967 --> 00:12:07,926
Who the fuck is this?

177
00:12:07,927 --> 00:12:10,846
It's me auntie.
Who do you think he is?

178
00:12:10,847 --> 00:12:13,726
What, you've got a twin brother?

179
00:12:13,727 --> 00:12:16,246
Now it's getting past you,
is it, today?

180
00:12:16,247 --> 00:12:19,406
Check out the big brains
on the probation worker here.

181
00:12:19,407 --> 00:12:22,166
Why's he wearing a jumpsuit?

182
00:12:22,167 --> 00:12:23,886
Because...

183
00:12:23,887 --> 00:12:27,886
sometimes I do my community
service, sometimes he does it.

184
00:12:28,327 --> 00:12:31,806
We like to mix things up.
It keeps it interesting.

185
00:12:31,807 --> 00:12:34,086
This isn't a job share.

186
00:12:34,087 --> 00:12:38,086
Whoever does the crime,
does the boring, mindless shit.

187
00:12:38,447 --> 00:12:40,526
I have a question, right?

188
00:12:40,527 --> 00:12:44,446
What if we we're conjoined twins,
yeah, with our heads?

189
00:12:44,447 --> 00:12:46,286
They're all mashed together,

190
00:12:46,287 --> 00:12:49,446
and we go out in the town,
for a few beers,

191
00:12:49,447 --> 00:12:51,806
some bloke sees us
and he's like,

192
00:12:51,807 --> 00:12:54,606
"Oi! You two-headed fuck!"

193
00:12:54,607 --> 00:12:58,606
He flips out, goes mental
and batters the guy.

194
00:12:59,727 --> 00:13:01,966
Who does the community service then?

195
00:13:01,967 --> 00:13:05,366
Because they, they are conjoined
with one massive head

196
00:13:05,367 --> 00:13:09,366
but with two personalities.

197
00:13:12,607 --> 00:13:14,446
Well, we'll cross that bridge
when we come to it.

198
00:13:14,447 --> 00:13:16,086
All right.

199
00:13:16,087 --> 00:13:18,686
I'm going to pretend like
I never saw this,

200
00:13:18,687 --> 00:13:20,846
because I really can't be arsed.

201
00:13:20,847 --> 00:13:24,846
Just make sure one of you turns up.

202
00:13:26,167 --> 00:13:29,006
Oh man.

203
00:13:29,007 --> 00:13:30,206
That's insane.

204
00:13:30,207 --> 00:13:34,206
The old conjoined twins mind fuck
works every time. Dunnit?

205
00:13:48,007 --> 00:13:50,326
What're you doing?

206
00:13:50,327 --> 00:13:52,886
I'm just talking to Peter.

207
00:13:52,887 --> 00:13:54,006
Why?

208
00:13:54,007 --> 00:13:55,046
What d'you mean?

209
00:13:55,047 --> 00:13:57,126
Why were you talking to him?

210
00:13:57,127 --> 00:13:59,406
He's my friend.

211
00:13:59,407 --> 00:14:01,806
He's your friend?

212
00:14:01,807 --> 00:14:05,806
I do have friends... you know.

213
00:14:06,767 --> 00:14:09,046
Yeah, I know.
I didn't mean it like that.

214
00:14:09,047 --> 00:14:13,046
What are you doing later?
I'm going to hang out with Peter.

215
00:14:13,407 --> 00:14:17,406
OK. I was going to see
some friends anyway, so...

216
00:14:43,327 --> 00:14:45,886
You have a secret lair.

217
00:14:45,887 --> 00:14:49,006
This is totally superhero.

218
00:14:49,007 --> 00:14:51,326
How did you find this place?

219
00:14:51,327 --> 00:14:52,566
I didn't find it.

220
00:14:52,567 --> 00:14:55,406
It was my future self.

221
00:14:55,407 --> 00:14:58,126
He lived here.

222
00:14:58,127 --> 00:15:02,086
You have a future self?

223
00:15:02,087 --> 00:15:05,486
Tell me everything.

224
00:15:05,487 --> 00:15:08,046
He's chasing Alisha through
the warehouse.

225
00:15:08,047 --> 00:15:10,686
He catches her
and he's pointing a gun at her.

226
00:15:10,687 --> 00:15:12,966
I'm just waiting, up on the roof.

227
00:15:12,967 --> 00:15:14,926
I jump as he pulls the trigger.

228
00:15:14,927 --> 00:15:17,326
I die saving her.

229
00:15:17,327 --> 00:15:19,726
You die?

230
00:15:19,727 --> 00:15:21,846
Well if you know it's going
to happen,

231
00:15:21,847 --> 00:15:24,566
why don't you wear
a bullet proof vest?

232
00:15:24,567 --> 00:15:27,046
Because if the future me
doesn't die,

233
00:15:27,047 --> 00:15:30,326
she'll never fall in love with me
as I was then, in the present.

234
00:15:30,327 --> 00:15:32,766
And if she doesn't
fall in love with me,

235
00:15:32,767 --> 00:15:34,926
I'll never become my future self.

236
00:15:34,927 --> 00:15:36,486
And if I don't become him,

237
00:15:36,487 --> 00:15:38,406
I won't be able to save her

238
00:15:38,407 --> 00:15:41,326
and she'll never fall in love with me.

239
00:15:41,327 --> 00:15:45,046
It all has to happen,
exactly like it happened.

240
00:15:45,047 --> 00:15:49,046
It's my destiny.

241
00:15:50,367 --> 00:15:54,366
That is so fucking cool.

242
00:15:58,527 --> 00:16:00,006
What are you doing?

243
00:16:00,007 --> 00:16:04,006
Why is that out?

244
00:16:07,567 --> 00:16:11,566
I was just showing it to Peter.

245
00:16:11,887 --> 00:16:13,286
Have you told him?

246
00:16:13,287 --> 00:16:15,766
It was Peter I saved
from the mugger.

247
00:16:15,767 --> 00:16:17,486
He recognised me.

248
00:16:17,487 --> 00:16:20,006
What, so you just tell him
everything?

249
00:16:20,007 --> 00:16:22,126
It's OK.

250
00:16:22,127 --> 00:16:23,646
I won't tell anyone.

251
00:16:23,647 --> 00:16:26,086
This has got nothing to do with you.

252
00:16:26,087 --> 00:16:30,086
Can you just leave?

253
00:16:31,567 --> 00:16:35,406
Go!?

254
00:16:35,407 --> 00:16:39,406
I think you should probably go.

255
00:16:51,967 --> 00:16:54,206
Why are you telling him
all this stuff?

256
00:16:54,207 --> 00:16:55,646
He's my friend.

257
00:16:55,647 --> 00:16:59,126
He's not your friend.
You've only just met him.

258
00:16:59,127 --> 00:17:00,926
We've talked about this.

259
00:17:00,927 --> 00:17:04,926
I don't want to see that
fucking suit ever again...

260
00:17:18,807 --> 00:17:20,646
D'you want any toast?

261
00:17:20,647 --> 00:17:23,126
I have to face my destiny, alone.

262
00:17:23,127 --> 00:17:24,566
OK.

263
00:17:24,567 --> 00:17:28,566
Is that before or after
you have breakfast?

264
00:17:28,567 --> 00:17:32,406
Being a superhero is a heavy burden.

265
00:17:32,407 --> 00:17:35,046
So now you're calling
yourself a superhero?

266
00:17:35,047 --> 00:17:38,486
Right.

267
00:17:38,487 --> 00:17:41,046
I have to terminate
our relationship.

268
00:17:41,047 --> 00:17:42,366
What?

269
00:17:42,367 --> 00:17:44,246
Why are you talking like that?

270
00:17:44,247 --> 00:17:47,566
I have to sacrifice our love
for the greater good.

271
00:17:47,567 --> 00:17:51,326
What the fuck has got into you?
Where's all this coming from?

272
00:17:51,327 --> 00:17:54,726
Goodbye, Alisha.

273
00:17:54,727 --> 00:17:56,046
Where are you going?

274
00:17:56,047 --> 00:17:58,686
You can't just walk away, Simon.

275
00:17:58,687 --> 00:18:02,686
What the fuck are you doing?

276
00:18:02,847 --> 00:18:05,846
One day, you'll come to see that
I did it all for you.

277
00:18:05,847 --> 00:18:09,246
Simon! Wait!

278
00:18:09,247 --> 00:18:13,246
Simon!

279
00:18:29,727 --> 00:18:32,806
What did he say exactly?

280
00:18:32,807 --> 00:18:34,206
He was talking shit.

281
00:18:34,207 --> 00:18:37,886
He said we can't be together.
Everything was fine.

282
00:18:37,887 --> 00:18:40,086
It's like it's just come
out of nowhere.

283
00:18:40,087 --> 00:18:41,326
What's going on? You all right?

284
00:18:41,327 --> 00:18:43,566
Her and Simon have split up.

285
00:18:43,567 --> 00:18:46,006
What? I thought you two
were well loved up?

286
00:18:46,007 --> 00:18:46,846
Yes, so did I.

287
00:18:46,847 --> 00:18:49,486
Oh...

288
00:18:49,487 --> 00:18:50,486
Oh...

289
00:18:50,487 --> 00:18:51,926
What?

290
00:18:51,927 --> 00:18:53,606
I can't, I can't tell you.

291
00:18:53,607 --> 00:18:54,966
Tell me what?

292
00:18:54,967 --> 00:18:56,406
Mmm!

293
00:18:56,407 --> 00:18:59,406
The other day,
I walked in on Simon,

294
00:18:59,407 --> 00:19:03,406
shy, stealing handbag kid in the
toilets, I can't tell you. I can't.

295
00:19:03,407 --> 00:19:04,046
What is it?

296
00:19:04,047 --> 00:19:07,646
They were showing each
other their cocks.

297
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:08,446
That's bullshit.

298
00:19:08,447 --> 00:19:12,166
No. I think I know what two
blokes in a public toilet look like,

299
00:19:12,167 --> 00:19:14,566
showing each other their knobs.

300
00:19:14,567 --> 00:19:18,526
All I'm saying is, maybe your
boyfriend is a proud beautiful
gay man,

301
00:19:18,527 --> 00:19:21,646
who likes to rub
and touch other men's penises.

302
00:19:21,647 --> 00:19:24,406
He's not gay!
He's the best shag I ever had.

303
00:19:24,407 --> 00:19:26,286
I'll just pretend I'm not here,
yeah?

304
00:19:26,287 --> 00:19:28,726
I've got a lot more control.
That was my first time.

305
00:19:28,727 --> 00:19:31,326
I'm in full control
of my ejaculate now.

306
00:19:31,327 --> 00:19:32,366
All blokes say that.

307
00:19:32,367 --> 00:19:35,886
Next thing you know, you've got come
all over your face and in your hair.

308
00:19:35,887 --> 00:19:37,726
That's a lovely image.

309
00:19:37,727 --> 00:19:39,006
He's not gay.

310
00:19:39,007 --> 00:19:41,126
I'm not saying you turned him,

311
00:19:41,127 --> 00:19:44,646
but maybe you did.

312
00:19:44,647 --> 00:19:46,246
You're deflecting.

313
00:19:46,247 --> 00:19:48,726
All right. Take it out
on your Uncle Rudy.

314
00:19:48,727 --> 00:19:50,846
Do it! Jesus!

315
00:19:50,847 --> 00:19:53,726
What the fuck is your problem!?

316
00:19:53,727 --> 00:19:55,006
She's deflecting.

317
00:19:55,007 --> 00:19:59,006
Jesus.

318
00:20:09,927 --> 00:20:13,926
Did he tell you he split up with me?

319
00:20:14,087 --> 00:20:16,126
I'm sure you're really
happy about that.

320
00:20:16,127 --> 00:20:18,566
You've got your little friend
all to yourself now.

321
00:20:18,567 --> 00:20:21,606
Being a superhero
and having a girlfriend...

322
00:20:21,607 --> 00:20:24,446
They don't mix.
They never have.

323
00:20:24,447 --> 00:20:27,886
Very few superheroes have
successful relationships.

324
00:20:27,887 --> 00:20:31,166
He's not a superhero.
He's my boyfriend.

325
00:20:31,167 --> 00:20:32,646
He WAS your boyfriend.

326
00:20:32,647 --> 00:20:36,646
Fuck you, you little prick!

327
00:20:36,647 --> 00:20:39,046
What's that?

328
00:20:39,047 --> 00:20:41,806
Are you obsessed with him
or something?

329
00:20:41,807 --> 00:20:43,206
What else have you got there?

330
00:20:43,207 --> 00:20:47,206
Get off!

331
00:20:52,967 --> 00:20:56,206
What is this?

332
00:20:56,207 --> 00:20:59,646
Have you done something to him?

333
00:20:59,647 --> 00:21:01,126
What's going on?

334
00:21:01,127 --> 00:21:05,126
The kid from yesterday. I think
he's done something to Simon.

335
00:21:31,567 --> 00:21:33,006
Where's Alisha?

336
00:21:33,007 --> 00:21:34,886
She said she'd meet us here.

337
00:21:44,607 --> 00:21:47,246
You can buy us a drink if you want.

338
00:21:47,247 --> 00:21:49,766
I could do that.

339
00:21:49,767 --> 00:21:51,406
What d'you want?

340
00:21:51,407 --> 00:21:53,086
A pint of lager.

341
00:21:53,087 --> 00:21:55,206
The expensive, French stuff.

342
00:21:55,207 --> 00:21:58,526
A pint of lager.
The expensive French stuff.

343
00:21:58,527 --> 00:22:01,766
And a gin and tonic, please.

344
00:22:01,767 --> 00:22:03,286
A gin and tonic?

345
00:22:03,287 --> 00:22:04,766
I can't drink lager.
It's too gassy.

346
00:22:04,767 --> 00:22:05,806
Are you for real?

347
00:22:05,807 --> 00:22:08,366
Sure you don't want
a little pink umbrella in it?

348
00:22:08,367 --> 00:22:09,846
What's wrong with gin and tonic?

349
00:22:09,847 --> 00:22:11,126
It's what my nan drinks.

350
00:22:11,127 --> 00:22:14,846
Maybe me and your nan
should go out some time. Cheers.

351
00:22:14,847 --> 00:22:17,846
The last bloke she was seeing
fell over and broke his hip.

352
00:22:17,847 --> 00:22:20,886
She's on the market.

353
00:22:20,887 --> 00:22:23,806
What about you?

354
00:22:23,807 --> 00:22:26,566
I'm not seeing anyone.

355
00:22:26,567 --> 00:22:29,126
How about you?

356
00:22:29,127 --> 00:22:31,366
I'll tell my nan you're available.

357
00:22:31,367 --> 00:22:35,366
You do that.

358
00:22:36,727 --> 00:22:38,246
What's going on?

359
00:22:38,247 --> 00:22:39,326
The usual shit.

360
00:22:39,327 --> 00:22:42,486
I don't know what I did with my life
before these powers came along.

361
00:22:42,487 --> 00:22:44,006
You probably hung out in bars,

362
00:22:44,007 --> 00:22:47,286
drinking expensive French lager,
talking to good looking guys.

363
00:22:47,287 --> 00:22:48,766
Something like that.

364
00:22:48,767 --> 00:22:52,766
Kelly.

365
00:23:03,407 --> 00:23:05,766
Thanks for the drink.

366
00:23:05,767 --> 00:23:09,766
Any time.

367
00:23:20,047 --> 00:23:21,926
You made Simon break up with me, didn't you?

368
00:23:21,927 --> 00:23:23,286
I had to.

369
00:23:23,287 --> 00:23:25,686
You don't understand.

370
00:23:25,687 --> 00:23:27,326
It all has to happen.

371
00:23:27,327 --> 00:23:29,726
We ain't debating it with you.
It's over.

372
00:23:29,727 --> 00:23:32,846
Yes, so you either play ball,
or you play hardball.

373
00:23:32,847 --> 00:23:34,846
What does that even mean?

374
00:23:34,847 --> 00:23:38,006
Hardball. It's like a threat,
isn't it? I'm threatening him...

375
00:23:38,007 --> 00:23:42,006
Whoa!

376
00:23:53,047 --> 00:23:55,966
I don't want to hurt you,
but I fucking will.

377
00:23:55,967 --> 00:23:59,966
It all has to happen like this.

378
00:24:03,687 --> 00:24:06,846
Where the fuck have you been
the past few weeks?

379
00:24:06,847 --> 00:24:08,526
Who's he?

380
00:24:08,527 --> 00:24:09,726
He's this guy.

381
00:24:09,727 --> 00:24:12,486
He shows up sometimes
and helps us out with shit.

382
00:24:12,487 --> 00:24:16,486
Right. Well, it's nice to meet you,
man. I'm Rudy and I'm new.

383
00:24:18,647 --> 00:24:21,366
Doesn't say much, does he?

384
00:24:21,367 --> 00:24:23,046
Now you're here,

385
00:24:23,047 --> 00:24:26,366
you can help us kick the shit out of
that little prick.

386
00:24:26,367 --> 00:24:28,206
Kelly, don't. Just leave it, yeah?

387
00:24:28,207 --> 00:24:29,446
You're protecting him now, yeah?

388
00:24:29,447 --> 00:24:33,446
This is bullshit. Come here.

389
00:25:00,407 --> 00:25:02,246
What the fuck just happened?

390
00:25:02,247 --> 00:25:05,006
I thought he was supposed to
be on our side?

391
00:25:05,007 --> 00:25:06,806
I have never even met the guy.

392
00:25:06,807 --> 00:25:08,846
I am, I am, I am new.

393
00:25:08,847 --> 00:25:10,966
I don't know what's going on.

394
00:25:10,967 --> 00:25:14,966
What's going on? Anyone?

395
00:25:14,967 --> 00:25:16,045
No?

396
00:25:34,063 --> 00:25:35,742
When I see that fucker in the mask,

397
00:25:35,743 --> 00:25:38,222
I'm going to beat the shit
out of him.

398
00:25:38,223 --> 00:25:40,462
Ah, the guy in the mask.

399
00:25:40,463 --> 00:25:44,462
I think I know who he is.
I know who he is.

400
00:25:44,663 --> 00:25:46,502
Who is it?

401
00:25:46,503 --> 00:25:48,542
It's the probation worker.

402
00:25:48,543 --> 00:25:50,342
The probation worker?

403
00:25:50,343 --> 00:25:53,582
Yeah, cos that would be fucking
ridiculous, wouldn't it, eh?

404
00:25:53,583 --> 00:25:56,102
Because he wouldn't piss on us
if we were on fire,

405
00:25:56,103 --> 00:26:00,102
and if he was really desperate for a piss.

406
00:26:02,543 --> 00:26:05,822
Well, it's definitely not him, is it?

407
00:26:05,823 --> 00:26:08,302
D'you want to stay over at mine?

408
00:26:08,303 --> 00:26:11,782
Maybe we should all stay over?

409
00:26:11,783 --> 00:26:13,182
Fuck off.

410
00:26:13,183 --> 00:26:17,182
Another time maybe.

411
00:26:29,063 --> 00:26:33,062
I'll have to pick that up later.

412
00:26:34,823 --> 00:26:36,982
Pick it up, then.

413
00:26:36,983 --> 00:26:38,422
Seriously?

414
00:26:38,423 --> 00:26:42,422
Use a bin.

415
00:26:44,063 --> 00:26:46,302
Sorry.

416
00:26:46,303 --> 00:26:48,222
Sorry I had to leave the other night.

417
00:26:48,223 --> 00:26:52,022
Maybe we could do it again
some other time?

418
00:26:52,023 --> 00:26:55,422
Erm, I'm kinda busy.

419
00:26:55,423 --> 00:26:59,422
What? You're busy all the time?

420
00:26:59,743 --> 00:27:01,422
Look, I can't see you like that.

421
00:27:01,423 --> 00:27:04,662
What is it with you?
Yesterday, you're buying me drinks,

422
00:27:04,663 --> 00:27:07,982
talking flirty shit about my nan.
And now you're too busy?

423
00:27:07,983 --> 00:27:11,942
I'm sorry.

424
00:27:11,943 --> 00:27:15,702
Has this got something to do
with the dead girl at the cemetery?

425
00:27:15,703 --> 00:27:17,702
How d'you know about that?

426
00:27:17,703 --> 00:27:19,782
I saw you leave flowers on her grave.

427
00:27:19,783 --> 00:27:21,742
And yeah, I followed you
cos I fancy ya.

428
00:27:21,743 --> 00:27:25,742
Let's just stop all the bullshit.
Who is she?

429
00:27:30,903 --> 00:27:34,902
She's my girlfriend. Er...

430
00:27:35,023 --> 00:27:39,022
she was my girlfriend.

431
00:27:40,223 --> 00:27:44,222
What happened?

432
00:27:44,783 --> 00:27:47,982
She died.

433
00:27:47,983 --> 00:27:51,982
A drugs overdose.

434
00:27:54,023 --> 00:27:56,302
Before the storm,

435
00:27:56,303 --> 00:28:00,302
I was a regular dealer.
I gave her the gear.

436
00:28:01,983 --> 00:28:05,982
I could've stopped her.
She fucking OD'd and it's my fault.

437
00:28:06,343 --> 00:28:09,622
I'm sorry, yeah.

438
00:28:09,623 --> 00:28:13,622
But she's dead, there isn't
anything you can do about it.

439
00:28:17,263 --> 00:28:21,262
I still love her.

440
00:28:22,103 --> 00:28:23,502
I'm sorry.

441
00:28:23,503 --> 00:28:27,502
I never meant to mess you about.

442
00:28:46,383 --> 00:28:50,222
I don't think he's showing up.

443
00:28:50,223 --> 00:28:53,342
This reminds me of when
I met this girl, right?

444
00:28:53,343 --> 00:28:56,342
And we go back to her flat
and we spent the most

445
00:28:56,343 --> 00:28:58,742
amazing night together.

446
00:28:58,743 --> 00:29:01,702
I was head over heels. I loved her,
more than I ever thought

447
00:29:01,703 --> 00:29:04,862
it was possible to love another
human being. Right, anyway,

448
00:29:04,863 --> 00:29:07,902
in the morning, I had to go court
and she makes me promise

449
00:29:07,903 --> 00:29:11,902
that I'd come back. So when I were
done, I rushed all the way back
to her flat and she's not there.

450
00:29:12,463 --> 00:29:16,182
I wait and I wait.
But she never comes.

451
00:29:16,183 --> 00:29:20,182
Right? I went back to that flat
every single day for a month.

452
00:29:20,783 --> 00:29:24,782
Sometimes twice,
even three times a day. But...

453
00:29:25,303 --> 00:29:28,542
she was gone, so...

454
00:29:28,543 --> 00:29:30,062
Did you ever find out
what happened to her?

455
00:29:30,063 --> 00:29:32,142
Oh, no, nothing happened to her, man.

456
00:29:32,143 --> 00:29:35,182
It turned out I'd been going
to the wrong flat.

457
00:29:35,183 --> 00:29:38,142
That is fucking heartbreaking,
innit? Come on, it's all right.

458
00:29:38,143 --> 00:29:39,262
Oh, piss off!

459
00:29:39,263 --> 00:29:43,222
All right. Fair enough. Look, but
don't touch. I hear you, sweetheart.

460
00:29:43,223 --> 00:29:47,222
I'm going to see where he is.

461
00:30:01,703 --> 00:30:05,702
He's with the weird kid,
looking at comics in our flat.

462
00:30:05,743 --> 00:30:06,942
Very romantic.

463
00:30:06,943 --> 00:30:10,942
Oh, no, we've moved on from all the
cheap innuendo about his sexuality.

464
00:30:11,063 --> 00:30:15,062
Go on, carry on, I'm listening now.
What is the plan?

465
00:30:24,023 --> 00:30:25,502
Oh, shit.

466
00:30:25,503 --> 00:30:29,502
It's all right.

467
00:30:31,623 --> 00:30:32,822
I can handle this.

468
00:30:32,823 --> 00:30:36,822
I done a BTEC in computer science.

469
00:30:38,543 --> 00:30:39,622
What're you doing!?

470
00:30:39,623 --> 00:30:41,822
I'm trying to turn off the alarm.

471
00:30:41,823 --> 00:30:45,102
Oh, that's a shame.
That's a shame, it's broken.

472
00:30:45,103 --> 00:30:47,182
Is that what they taught you
on your BTEC in computer science?

473
00:30:47,183 --> 00:30:48,782
I never said I passed it.

474
00:30:48,783 --> 00:30:52,782
Get out of the way.

475
00:31:06,583 --> 00:31:07,902
You're a fucking rocket scientist.

476
00:31:07,903 --> 00:31:11,902
Yes, I fucking am.

477
00:31:21,783 --> 00:31:25,782
This guy really needs
to get out more.

478
00:31:25,983 --> 00:31:29,662
Try some internet dating...

479
00:31:29,663 --> 00:31:33,662
or a salsa class.
I've heard they're...

480
00:31:35,183 --> 00:31:38,622
We're not here to sort out
his social life, are we?

481
00:31:38,623 --> 00:31:42,622
I told you, whatever he draws,
it actually happens.

482
00:31:49,423 --> 00:31:53,422
Rip them up. Maybe that'll stop it.

483
00:31:56,943 --> 00:32:00,102
Are you OK?

484
00:32:00,103 --> 00:32:01,262
I'm fine.

485
00:32:01,263 --> 00:32:05,262
I'll see you later?

486
00:32:40,303 --> 00:32:44,302
Alisha?

487
00:33:04,863 --> 00:33:08,862
I split up with you.
Why would I do that?

488
00:33:09,623 --> 00:33:11,662
What was I thinking?

489
00:33:11,663 --> 00:33:15,662
Look at you.

490
00:33:16,263 --> 00:33:18,942
I want you back.

491
00:33:18,943 --> 00:33:21,062
Let's get back together.

492
00:33:21,063 --> 00:33:23,182
Can we do that?

493
00:33:23,183 --> 00:33:26,742
Don't say no. Please don't say no.

494
00:33:26,743 --> 00:33:30,742
It was Peter's drawings.
Whatever he drew, it came true.

495
00:33:32,743 --> 00:33:36,742
He made you break up with me.

496
00:33:36,743 --> 00:33:38,022
I hurt you.

497
00:33:38,023 --> 00:33:42,022
It wasn't your fault.

498
00:33:50,423 --> 00:33:54,422
I'm so sorry.

499
00:34:44,023 --> 00:34:45,622
I know what you did.

500
00:34:45,623 --> 00:34:49,422
I was just trying to help you.

501
00:34:49,423 --> 00:34:53,422
How can you say that?
You manipulated me.

502
00:34:54,423 --> 00:34:57,422
Alisha doesn't want you to be
who you need to become.

503
00:34:57,423 --> 00:35:00,462
She doesn't understand.

504
00:35:00,463 --> 00:35:03,102
I did it for both of you.

505
00:35:03,103 --> 00:35:06,062
You made me split up with her.

506
00:35:06,063 --> 00:35:07,782
I had to do it.

507
00:35:07,783 --> 00:35:11,782
You told me. You told me
if you don't go back in time,

508
00:35:12,543 --> 00:35:14,622
she'll never fall in love with you.

509
00:35:14,623 --> 00:35:17,462
And if she doesn't
fall in love with you...

510
00:35:17,463 --> 00:35:19,902
Well, you won't do
what you have to do.

511
00:35:19,903 --> 00:35:23,902
You know it better than I do.

512
00:35:26,343 --> 00:35:29,542
Maybe I was wrong.

513
00:35:29,543 --> 00:35:33,542
I thought I had to become him
to protect Alisha.

514
00:35:34,503 --> 00:35:37,222
All I did was hurt her.

515
00:35:37,223 --> 00:35:41,222
I know you can do it.
You can save her.

516
00:35:41,663 --> 00:35:44,222
You're a superhero.

517
00:35:44,223 --> 00:35:48,222
It's your destiny.

518
00:35:49,663 --> 00:35:53,662
I'm not a superhero.

519
00:35:53,903 --> 00:35:56,622
They're a fantasy.

520
00:35:56,623 --> 00:35:59,222
It's your fantasy,

521
00:35:59,223 --> 00:36:00,862
not mine.

522
00:36:00,863 --> 00:36:04,862
I won't ever leave her.

523
00:36:19,783 --> 00:36:21,462
So which one of you is it today?

524
00:36:21,463 --> 00:36:22,982
I'm the good looking one.

525
00:36:22,983 --> 00:36:26,222
You're both equally fuck ugly
as far as I can see.

526
00:36:26,223 --> 00:36:29,022
Right. I pity you, mate.

527
00:36:29,023 --> 00:36:31,382
Your anger. Your bitterness.

528
00:36:31,383 --> 00:36:35,342
Your hatred for all that is good
and pure in the world.

529
00:36:35,343 --> 00:36:38,142
Now, don't take this the wrong
way or anything,

530
00:36:38,143 --> 00:36:42,142
but I think you might have been
sexually abused as a small child.

531
00:36:49,543 --> 00:36:51,262
What's up with you?

532
00:36:51,263 --> 00:36:55,222
A word of advice, don't ever suggest
the probation worker was sexually

533
00:36:55,223 --> 00:36:56,862
abused as a small child.

534
00:36:56,863 --> 00:36:58,702
He did not like that at all.

535
00:36:58,703 --> 00:37:02,702
Funny that.

536
00:37:02,983 --> 00:37:04,542
Looks like those two made up.

537
00:37:04,543 --> 00:37:07,542
Yeah, you know,
in many ways that is a real shame,

538
00:37:07,543 --> 00:37:09,302
cos I reckon I could've tapped that.

539
00:37:09,303 --> 00:37:13,302
Off the rebound. You know what I
mean? Nowt better than a teary fuck.

540
00:37:14,143 --> 00:37:18,142
Wouldn't do it. Wouldn't do that.
Thought never even crossed my mind.

541
00:37:18,303 --> 00:37:33,302
No-one is happier than me
that we are all back to normal.

542
00:38:11,103 --> 00:38:15,102
Ah!

543
00:38:18,343 --> 00:38:22,342
Alisha?

544
00:39:08,623 --> 00:39:11,022
Why are you doing this?!

545
00:39:11,023 --> 00:39:15,022
What do you want?!
Please, will you just let me go?!

546
00:39:46,903 --> 00:39:48,862
Mmm! Mmm!

547
00:39:48,863 --> 00:39:51,702
Mmm!

548
00:39:51,703 --> 00:39:55,702
Ah!

549
00:40:38,023 --> 00:40:40,422
Are you OK? Did he hurt you?

550
00:40:40,423 --> 00:40:44,422
I'm fine.

551
00:41:01,663 --> 00:41:03,902
Why?

552
00:41:03,903 --> 00:41:06,542
Why did you do it?

553
00:41:06,543 --> 00:41:09,622
You did it.

554
00:41:09,623 --> 00:41:13,622
You... You saved her.

555
00:41:13,983 --> 00:41:16,902
A superhero

556
00:41:16,903 --> 00:41:20,902
has to be prepared to die
for what he believes in.

557
00:41:50,263 --> 00:41:53,662
Alisha?

558
00:41:53,663 --> 00:41:57,662
It's like watching you die all over again.

559
00:41:59,543 --> 00:42:03,542
I don't want you to become him.

560
00:42:03,863 --> 00:42:06,902
I want you to stay here with me.

561
00:42:06,903 --> 00:42:09,022
You don't have to go back.

562
00:42:09,023 --> 00:42:12,222
Promise me you won't go back.

563
00:42:12,223 --> 00:42:15,502
Promise me.

564
00:42:15,503 --> 00:42:19,502
I promise.

565
00:42:23,743 --> 00:42:27,742
I don't want you to put that suit on
ever again.

566
00:42:32,623 --> 00:42:34,622
Burn it.

567
00:42:34,623 --> 00:42:38,622
With him.

568
00:43:43,703 --> 00:43:47,702
I did it.

569
00:43:47,727 --> 00:43:53,027
