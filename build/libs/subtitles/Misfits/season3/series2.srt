1
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:12,879
They needed to send a message.

2
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:16,556
Turning into a girl, does it
cause sexual confusion?

3
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:18,599
They all got their powers before me.
That's all he had left.

4
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:21,519
This girl he turns into,
would you fuck her?

5
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:25,239
We've never seen her.

6
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:25,759
Shit!

7
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:27,879
We can't get caught,
we're on probation.

8
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:31,879
Didn't take you long did it?
Congratulations.

9
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:37,639
(INAUDIBLE UNDER MUSIC)

10
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:39,839
What d'you say?

11
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:43,839
I said do you miss it, the running?

12
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:47,559
Ain't nothing I can do about it,
is there?

13
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:49,119
Why you even asking?

14
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:53,119
You're in a good mood!

15

<font color="#3333FF">Subtitles by Red Bee Media Ltd, MemoryOnSmells</font>

16
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:38,679
Hey, you ran an 11.9.
That's quick. That's very quick.

17
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:40,439
Who's your coach?

18
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:41,599
I haven't got one.

19
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:44,599
You should have one. Just think
what you could achieve.

20
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:47,919
I just want to run.
I'm not interested in anything else.

21
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:51,919
OK. It's your call.

22
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:59,799
Hi. Hi.

23
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:02,119
I'm Emma.

24
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:03,919
And you're?

25
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:07,919
Mel... issa.

26
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:12,799
I'm one of the losers
you thrashed out there.

27
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:18,959
Looks like we'll have
to up our game.

28
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:24,399
I should go.

29
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:28,399
(WHISTLES)

30
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,919
The toilets are out of order.

31
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:33,159
So you piss in a sink?

32
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:37,039
Yeah, I was going to piss in like
a bottle or the vending machine,

33
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:41,039
but this seemed more civilised.
I'm not a complete caveman!

34
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:46,519
Oh.

35
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:48,439
Do we know each other?

36
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:50,359
I don't think so.

37
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:53,999
Now that is a tragedy.

38
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,999
We should really do something
about it.

39
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:08,199
Move!

40
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,999
Imagine being up
to your balls in there.

41
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:27,919
What can I get you?

42
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:31,919
Vodka and coke. Double.

43
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:36,279
You're Curtis Donovan, aren't you?

44
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:39,199
I'm doing the training camp
at the Community Centre.

45
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:41,359
Saw you doing
Community Service.

46
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:44,239
Right.

47
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:45,639
So is that for drugs?

48
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:48,279
Nah.

49
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:50,599
Something else.

50
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:54,599
That's four quid.

51
00:05:56,280 --> 00:06:00,279
This is going to make me
sound totally sad, but...

52
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:05,279
I used to love to watch you run.

53
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:09,519
You were so focused,
like there was nothing else.

54
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:14,479
It's not cool, I know. I said it.

55
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:18,879
Thanks.

56
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:23,479
I thought you'd be off the alcohol
and that since you're training?

57
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:26,279
You sound like my coach.

58
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:28,919
He says I've got to take
my running more seriously.

59
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:32,919
I remember that! Your whole life
becomes the training.

60
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:36,279
You say it like you enjoyed it.

61
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:37,799
You're one of those people.

62
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,239
What do you call them? They get
off on being spanked...

63
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:40,279
Perverts?

64
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:44,279
No. Masochists. I'm not saying
you do like being spanked.

65
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:48,239
Maybe you do.

66
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:51,119
Not sure where
I was going with that!

67
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:53,799
Where are you staying?

68
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:57,799
Some student halls of residence.

69
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:03,319
So what is there to do around here?

70
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:18,359
You should do the lottery.
Use your power. See the numbers.

71
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,799
Stick it to them.
We'll split it, 50:50.

72
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:23,719
Why should I split it with you?

73
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:25,479
Because it was my idea, you!

74
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:29,359
I'm the brains, you're the stare.

75
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:32,039
OK. 60:50.

76
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:35,519
It's supposed to add up to 100.

77
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:39,199
Whoa, don't you even think
about screwing me, sweet cheeks!

78
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:40,759
70:40. Final offer.

79
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:42,199
I don't get to choose what I see.

80
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:44,639
Ah!

81
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:48,639
Fine! 80:30. But I feel like I've
been raped, and not in a good way.

82
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:52,799
What're you smiling at?

83
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:55,599
What? Am I not allowed to smile?

84
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:58,119
You look like you just got laid.

85
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:59,719
Did you just have a shag?

86
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:01,119
Something like that.

87
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,519
So who's the lucky girl?

88
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:06,519
You don't know her.

89
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:17,719
Piece of shit!

90
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:20,959
It won't start. I don't know
why I opened the bonnet.

91
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:21,839
No idea what I'm looking at.

92
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:22,919
Want me to look?

93
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:24,519
What you know about cars?

94
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:28,519
I know about electronics, cos I'm a
fucking rocket scientist, aren't I?

95
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:41,599
Try it now.

96
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:44,719
ENGINE STARTS

97
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:48,719
Thanks. You want a lift?

98
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:52,119
Look, you've already
undermined my masculinity.

99
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:56,119
At least let me drive you somewhere.
Get in.

100
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:57,839
Where to?

101
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:01,839
There.

102
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:13,959
Thanks for the lift.

103
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:15,839
Any time. I owe you.

104
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:17,759
Well you can give us
a new power if you want.

105
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:20,679
I don't owe you that much.

106
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:24,679
Right, see you around.

107
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:40,159
Mind if I run with you?

108
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:44,159
Yeah, I do.

109
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:51,439
You fancy going to
for a drink sometime?

110
00:09:56,360 --> 00:10:00,359
How about dinner? Hmm?

111
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:05,999
Jesus!

112
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,999
Catch you on the next lap, yeah?

113
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:13,279
You look like you had a late one?

114
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:15,559
You'll never guess who
I met last night.

115
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:16,679
Who?

116
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:19,679
Curtis Donovan. Remember him?

117
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:22,319
Sprinting guy that
got banned for drugs?

118
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,719
Right. So what's he like?

119
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:28,719
Well, I thought he was cute.

120
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:31,239
Then we went back to his.

121
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:34,279
By the time my ban's over,
it'll be too late.

122
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:36,599
No decent coach will want
to work with me.

123
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:39,799
All the guys I trained with,
I was way better than them.

124
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:43,719
He was so negative. Talk about
feeling sorry for yourself!

125
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:47,599
Running's the only thing
I was ever really good at.

126
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:50,119
The only thing that made
me feel good about myself.

127
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:53,079
It's like he blames everyone
else for what happened to him.

128
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:56,119
I had to kiss him just
to shut him up!

129
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:58,279
I ended up giving him
a sympathy shag.

130
00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:02,279
What do you mean?

131
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:08,119
Big mistake.

132
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:12,439
The guy is clueless.

133
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:23,199
It was some of the worst sex
I have ever had.

134
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:30,119
I have to warm down.

135
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:34,719
Good work today.

136
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:43,439
Hey, walking back to the Community
Centre? I'll walk with you.

137
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:44,879
What d'you want?

138
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:47,519
I want you to come for
a drink with me.

139
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:48,759
Just one drink.

140
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:50,359
I'm not interested, OK?

141
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:54,359
You don't know what you're missing.
I know how to please a woman.

142
00:11:56,760 --> 00:12:00,239
Take your fucking hand off my arse
before I break it!

143
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:04,239
Oh, my mistake.

144
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:09,199
Lesbian!

145
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:12,639
Hi.

146
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:16,639
Hi.

147
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:19,719
Look, about last night...

148
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:22,519
It's all right.

149
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:26,519
We were both drunk.
Let's just forget it ever happened.

150
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:31,439
I should get changed.

151
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:37,279
Ho-ho-ho!

152
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:39,639
Oh, that were brutal, weren't it?

153
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:43,079
That were like watching someone
fist a baby lamb.

154
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:45,799
She just took a huge shit
in your mouth!

155
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:46,919
Shut the fuck up, man!

156
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:48,279
All right.

157
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:51,799
Look, it happens to all of us.

158
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:55,799
Women are cruel and insensitive,
and they are hurtful.

159
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:04,679
But they're so beautiful.

160
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:08,679
They smell really nice.
They smell like...

161
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:14,199
Toffee apples.

162
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,319
Can I ask you something?

163
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:29,599
When we were together. Was I...?

164
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:32,799
What?

165
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:35,039
Was I all right?

166
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:37,719
You know, the sex stuff?

167
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:40,719
We couldn't actually touch
each other, so...

168
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:43,439
No, what we could do.

169
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,039
Was I shit?

170
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:46,479
No.

171
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:48,919
That's one of those nos
that means yes.

172
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:50,079
"No!" Fucking yes!

173
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:51,999
No! What're you saying?

174
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,199
I haven't said anything.

175
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:56,319
You were thinking it.
Go on, I want to hear it.

176
00:13:56,320 --> 00:14:00,319
No, you don't!

177
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:04,719
Is he better than me?

178
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:09,119
What, him? He's better than me?!

179
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:10,479
Don't talk about him like that!

180
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:12,119
Oh, man!

181
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:14,279
When we're doing it,
he's focused on me.

182
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:15,399
What, and I wasn't?

183
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:17,159
You just spent a lot of time
watching yourself.

184
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:18,999
That's bullshit!

185
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,999
Oh, really?
Look, you were like this.

186
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:35,119
You done?

187
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:38,959
Look, this is the reason why girls
never tell boys this stuff.

188
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:41,199
Your egos can't take it.

189
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:42,359
Oh, so that's another thing
wrong with me?

190
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:43,759
Oh, here we go!

191
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:44,999
What's that supposed to mean?

192
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,719
It's like there's this big fucking
cloud hanging over your head.

193
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:49,839
There ain't no cloud!

194
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:53,119
Oh really? "My life's shit!
Everything's shit!

195
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:56,359
I shouldn't even be here!"

196
00:14:56,360 --> 00:15:05,999
Look, if you don't want to hear it,
don't ask.

197
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:22,799
? Boom chakka, uh takka takka
Boom chakka, uh takka takka ?

198
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,039
? Boom chakka... ?

199
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:25,439
Oh!

200
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,439
? Boom chakka, uh uh uh ?

201
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:28,999
? Uh chakka, uh uh ?

202
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,159
? I'm putting out fires ?

203
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:34,959
? All over the place ?

204
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:38,519
? I guess it knocked me sideways ?

205
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:39,759
? Oh ?

206
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:41,959
? She make me go... ?

207
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:45,279
Ah! Ah!

208
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:46,359
Ah!

209
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:47,399
? Uh uh... ?

210
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:51,399
Ah!

211
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:55,679
D'you want to go out tonight?

212
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:57,759
It'll be fun!

213
00:15:57,760 --> 00:15:59,919
I haven't got anything to wear.

214
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:02,399
I'll lend you something.
About the same size.

215
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:05,039
C'mon.

216
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:06,279
Go out with me.

217
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:07,639
All right.

218
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:10,599
Guys, drugs test.

219
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:14,599
I'm going to need a urine sample
from both of you.

220
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:27,879
Oh, shit!

221
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:31,879
Oh, fuck!

222
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:36,439
Oh!

223
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,999
I had some trouble with my aim.

224
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:03,719
CAR DOOR OPENS

225
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:10,959
Come here.

226
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:19,879
Where are you going?

227
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:29,439
What's he doing?

228
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:32,399
I don't know.

229
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:35,719
So d'you want to tell me
what's going on?

230
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:36,999
Why're we following him?

231
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:40,999
Cos I want to know
what he's doing.

232
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:48,519
Kelly!

233
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:56,319
What's going on?

234
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:07,119
Oh, my God.
You fancy him, don't you?

235
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:08,799
You totally fancy him.

236
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:12,279
Shut up!

237
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:16,279
He is really fit.

238
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:20,719
So who's the dead girl, then?

239
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:37,279
What're you doing?

240
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:41,279
That's Curtis' locker.

241
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:45,439
It's me. Curtis.
This is how I look when I'm a girl.

242
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:47,239
What're you doing?

243
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:49,119
I'm running again.

244
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:50,839
You're running?

245
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:51,999
Like this?

246
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,039
It's the only way I can compete.
You can't tell anyone.

247
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:58,759
Not even Alisha.

248
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:02,719
C'mon, man. I need this.

249
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:05,479
All right.

250
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:07,199
Do me a favour.

251
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:10,919
Zip me up.

252
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:14,919
I don't know how you're supposed to
do these things up yourself.

253
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:21,879
It's fucking weird, man.

254
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:28,239
Don't tell anyone about this, yeah?

255
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:33,279
? DIGITALISM: Pogo ?

256
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:35,399
? Yeah, whoa-oh ?

257
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:39,399
? The sun is in the air ?

258
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:42,079
? The sun is in the air ?

259
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:45,519
? The sun is in the air... ?

260
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:49,239
Hi!

261
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:53,119
It looks better on you
than it does on me!

262
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:56,799
Let's get a drink.

263
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:59,719
? Now where has it been? ?

264
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:03,359
? I mean the good old wild days ?

265
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:06,479
? Became a bit too lame ?

266
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:10,479
? Just take a look at my place ?

267
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:13,679
? It's such a mess ?

268
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:17,679
? But I'll be outta this space
as soon as... ?

269
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:21,759
Are you bringing anyone
to the party tomorrow?

270
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:24,679
No.

271
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:28,679
I can't believe
you don't have a boyfriend.

272
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:32,719
You're so beautiful.

273
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:36,719
I don't really have time, with all
the training and everything.

274
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:41,719
Are you gay?

275
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:44,399
Why d'you say that?

276
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:46,039
I see how you look at me.

277
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:50,039
It's like how a boy looks at me when
he wants to get into my knickers.

278
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:58,039
I like it.

279
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:07,159
Have you ever been
with a girl before?

280
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:10,839
It's OK.

281
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:14,839
I'll show you what I like.

282
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:37,159
(BREATHES HEAVILY)

283
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:43,359
(GASPS)

284
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:50,679
(GASPS RAPIDLY)

285
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:52,919
Ah! Ah!

286
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:55,359
Ah...

287
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:59,359
(PANTS)

288
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:12,599
Being out with her,
it's like we connected.

289
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:14,479
We just talked.

290
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:17,039
There was no bullshit. Like...

291
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:18,719
I could just be myself.

292
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:20,159
But you weren't yourself.

293
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:23,959
She's not interested in me as a guy.
I tried that.

294
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:26,319
It's different.

295
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:28,479
Maybe I'm different.

296
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:31,599
Why can't it be like that with her
when I'm me?

297
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:35,439
We think differently to them.

298
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:39,039
Girls.

299
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:41,159
That's not all.

300
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:42,439
The sex...

301
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:45,399
You ain't lived until
you've had a multiple orgasm.

302
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:49,319
Guys are getting short-changed.
Ours is all, "Uh! Pth."

303
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:51,079
Their's...

304
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:55,079
The slow build up,
then it's like...

305
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:59,559
all through your body, ha,
like waves of pleasure.

306
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:01,639
Are you a lesbian?

307
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:04,359
What? No! No.

308
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:07,999
When I'm her, I'm still me and...

309
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,759
and I like girls,
so I guess she does, too.

310
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:12,679
So she is a lesbian?

311
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:16,679
I don't think there's
an official term for this shit.

312
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:22,959
So what're you going to do?

313
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:27,519
I don't want to stop seeing her.

314
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:35,359
VENDING MACHINE CLATTERS

315
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:39,959
Hi.

316
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:43,559
Hi.

317
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:47,559
How I was with you...
the other night...

318
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:50,959
being all negative.

319
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:54,959
That's not how I want to be.

320
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:59,239
I guess I need
to work some shit out.

321
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:05,079
I'm sorry.

322
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:39,599
Hiya.

323
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:42,959
I hear you girls are having a bit
of a party tonight. I was er...

324
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:44,719
thinking we should probably
go together.

325
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:46,039
I'm already going.

326
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:50,039
And I will see you there.

327
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:53,879
I am definitely in there, mate.

328
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:56,439
And the nice thing is,
she's already seen my cock,

329
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:58,079
and she's still up for it, so...

330
00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:58,919
How come she's seen your cock?

331
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:00,519
She caught me pissing in a sink.

332
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:02,479
It's all worked out very nicely.

333
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:05,479
Mm!

334
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:09,479
Hey.

335
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:19,599
What?

336
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:23,599
Nothing.

337
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:27,599
OK, I'll see you later.

338
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:47,599
Is that painful?

339
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:51,599
I've just tweaked a muscle.

340
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:56,799
Let me take a look.

341
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:06,359
You're very tight.

342
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:11,199
The muscle's all knotted.

343
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:21,799
We can't have you cramping up now,
can we?

344
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:27,959
Ah!

345
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:29,839
You OK?

346
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:32,519
Yeah.

347
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:35,742
It feels better.
I'm going to take a shower.

348
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:25,879
Mel? Hi. Drink?

349
00:27:25,961 --> 00:27:27,000
Go on.

350
00:27:27,001 --> 00:27:28,600
Enjoy yourself. Relax.

351
00:27:28,601 --> 00:27:29,680
No training tomorrow.

352
00:27:29,681 --> 00:27:32,720
Thanks.

353
00:27:32,721 --> 00:27:35,920
Listen, we should talk about fixing
you up with some more training.

354
00:27:35,921 --> 00:27:39,920
One on one. I think you could
really benefit from it.

355
00:27:40,281 --> 00:27:41,520
OK, yeah.

356
00:27:41,521 --> 00:27:44,920
Maybe we should go somewhere a bit
quieter and talk about it properly.

357
00:27:44,921 --> 00:27:48,200
Can we talk about this
some other time?

358
00:27:48,201 --> 00:27:52,200
Thanks for the drink.

359
00:27:56,041 --> 00:27:57,120
Hey! You made it.

360
00:27:57,121 --> 00:27:58,680
Why are you looking at my tits?

361
00:27:58,681 --> 00:28:02,080
Hello!
They're just there, aren't they?

362
00:28:02,081 --> 00:28:04,200
They're very nice, they're perky.
It's a reflex.

363
00:28:04,201 --> 00:28:08,200
Drink up. We're dancing.

364
00:28:09,281 --> 00:28:12,200
You have yourself a little dance
and I'll get you a drink in.

365
00:28:12,201 --> 00:28:16,200
Oh, yeah.

I need some air.

How much have you had to drink?

371
00:29:41,721 --> 00:29:44,120
I'm going to take you home, OK?

372
00:29:44,121 --> 00:29:48,120

Are you sure that's a good idea?

380
00:30:23,441 --> 00:30:27,440
It's just that you seem a bit
out of it and... Oh!

00:30:27,761 --> 00:30:31,760
Ohh, OK!

00:30:32,121 --> 00:30:35,440

I thought it was you!

390
00:30:59,401 --> 00:31:03,400
Is that why
you were calling me "Emma"?

391
00:31:03,641 --> 00:31:07,000
Emma! Wait!

395
00:31:18,281 --> 00:31:19,600
I need to find Emma.

00:31:19,601 --> 00:31:22,520
OK. We'll find her.

Are you all right?

404
00:33:20,961 --> 00:33:23,200
You know,
when you think you know someone,

405
00:33:23,201 --> 00:33:27,200
then they turn out
to be something different?

406
00:33:28,441 --> 00:33:32,440
Fuck it.
I don't want to think about it.

407
00:33:40,041 --> 00:33:43,640
So, what've you been up to?

408
00:33:43,641 --> 00:33:47,640
Nothin'. Just hanging out.

409
00:33:51,321 --> 00:33:52,640
Oh...

410
00:33:52,641 --> 00:33:56,640
I don't think you really want this.

411
00:33:58,921 --> 00:33:59,920
Put your clothes on.

412
00:33:59,921 --> 00:34:01,320
What is your problem?

413
00:34:01,321 --> 00:34:02,880
Do you want to have sex with me,

414
00:34:02,881 --> 00:34:05,160
or is this a revenge fuck?
I don't want that.

415
00:34:05,161 --> 00:34:09,160
You don't need to do this.

416
00:34:10,441 --> 00:34:13,880
Put your clothes on.

417
00:34:13,881 --> 00:34:17,880
I was wrong about you.

418
00:34:19,481 --> 00:34:21,000
Have I messed things up?

419
00:34:21,001 --> 00:34:25,000
No.

420
00:34:52,761 --> 00:34:55,040
This is my dress.

421
00:34:55,041 --> 00:34:59,040
Why have you got my dress?
I lent this to Mel.

422
00:35:00,161 --> 00:35:01,320
You're shagging her?

423
00:35:01,321 --> 00:35:02,280
No, it's not what you think it is.

424
00:35:02,281 --> 00:35:05,720
So, what is it?
How did this get here?

425
00:35:05,780 --> 00:35:06,739
You're such a fucking prick.

426
00:35:06,740 --> 00:35:09,379
Wait, Emma!

427
00:35:09,662 --> 00:35:11,278
Emma?

428
00:35:21,681 --> 00:35:24,920
Emma found the dress she lent me.
She thinks I'm shagging Mel.

429
00:35:24,921 --> 00:35:27,040
She thinks you're shagging Mel?

430
00:35:27,041 --> 00:35:29,320
No.
She thinks Curtis is shagging Mel.

431
00:35:29,321 --> 00:35:32,240
But I thought you were
sleeping with Emma?

432
00:35:32,241 --> 00:35:35,520
I was, but then Emma came round last
night. She made a pass at me.

433
00:35:35,521 --> 00:35:36,960
She made a pass at you?

434
00:35:36,961 --> 00:35:39,920
No. She made a pass at Curtis.

435
00:35:39,921 --> 00:35:41,560
Isn't that what you wanted?

436
00:35:41,561 --> 00:35:43,960
Yeah, but then she found the dress
she lent me,

437
00:35:43,961 --> 00:35:47,760
now she thinks Mel's cheating
on her, with me.

438
00:35:47,761 --> 00:35:49,400
So who's with Emma?

439
00:35:49,401 --> 00:35:53,400
No-one.
She thinks I'm fucking myself!

440
00:35:57,241 --> 00:36:01,240
I'm gonna get dressed, yeah?

441
00:36:12,281 --> 00:36:14,840
Hey.

442
00:36:14,841 --> 00:36:18,840
Listen, about last night.
I guess we were both drunk.

443
00:36:19,201 --> 00:36:22,520
I only had that one drink...
that you gave me.

444
00:36:22,521 --> 00:36:25,240
Well, maybe it was just me then,

445
00:36:25,241 --> 00:36:29,240
seemed like some really
weird shit was going on.

446
00:36:30,601 --> 00:36:34,600
I think it would be best if neither
of us said anything about it.

447
00:36:35,081 --> 00:36:39,080
We both just forget about it, yeah?

448
00:36:51,121 --> 00:36:52,440
What's going on with you and Simon?

449
00:36:52,441 --> 00:36:53,640
What? Nothing.

450
00:36:53,641 --> 00:36:54,960
That's my mate's boyfriend,
so you stay away from him.

451
00:36:54,961 --> 00:36:56,320
Listen...

452
00:36:56,321 --> 00:36:57,600
What's all that?

453
00:36:57,601 --> 00:36:59,040
Nothing.

454
00:36:59,041 --> 00:37:03,000
It better be nothing.

455
00:37:03,001 --> 00:37:04,440
What's going on?

456
00:37:04,441 --> 00:37:07,200
It looks like she's
after your boyfriend.

457
00:37:07,201 --> 00:37:09,320
Fuck knows why.

458
00:37:09,321 --> 00:37:09,680
That's bullshit.

459
00:37:09,681 --> 00:37:11,600
He was zipping up your dress.

460
00:37:11,601 --> 00:37:13,960
You were sticking your arse out
and jiggling your tits.

461
00:37:14,047 --> 00:37:14,566
Is that true?

462
00:37:14,567 --> 00:37:16,486
It's not what you think.

463
00:37:16,487 --> 00:37:18,926
What is going on?!

464
00:37:18,927 --> 00:37:21,806
This here, is your fault.

465
00:37:21,807 --> 00:37:24,086
Were you flirting with him?

466
00:37:24,087 --> 00:37:25,166
No.

467
00:37:25,167 --> 00:37:26,526
Get your own boyfriend, you slut.

468
00:37:26,527 --> 00:37:28,166
I'm not a slut.

469
00:37:28,167 --> 00:37:29,886
You're fucking Curtis Donovan! No.

470
00:37:29,887 --> 00:37:31,526
You're shagging Curtis now?

471
00:37:31,527 --> 00:37:32,806
It isn't like that.

472
00:37:32,807 --> 00:37:36,006
Ow!

473
00:37:36,007 --> 00:37:40,006
Emma!

474
00:37:40,727 --> 00:37:42,606
She's got an attitude on her,
hasn't she?

475
00:37:42,607 --> 00:37:44,486
I've got an attitude?

476
00:37:44,487 --> 00:37:48,286
You're always staring at my tits.
You had your hands all over my arse.

477
00:37:48,287 --> 00:37:50,286
I was just being friendly.

478
00:37:50,287 --> 00:37:53,526
And you ask before you touch.

479
00:37:53,527 --> 00:37:56,486
All the groping, and staring...
the sleazy chat-up lines.

480
00:37:56,487 --> 00:38:00,486
You have no idea what
it's like to be a woman.

481
00:38:02,927 --> 00:38:04,926
What?!

482
00:38:04,927 --> 00:38:08,526
I think you got your period.

483
00:38:08,527 --> 00:38:12,526
No-one needs to see that.

484
00:38:21,807 --> 00:38:22,926
It's Curtis.

485
00:38:22,927 --> 00:38:25,606
Hmm?

486
00:38:25,607 --> 00:38:27,526
The girl.

487
00:38:27,527 --> 00:38:29,566
It's Curtis.

488
00:38:29,567 --> 00:38:30,686
(HE RETCHES)

489
00:38:30,687 --> 00:38:34,686
You're kidding?

490
00:38:35,687 --> 00:38:36,326
What is wrong with you?

491
00:38:36,327 --> 00:38:40,326
Nothing... wrong.

492
00:38:48,087 --> 00:38:51,606
Curtis?

493
00:38:51,607 --> 00:38:54,126
I know it's you. Are you all right?

494
00:38:54,127 --> 00:38:57,566
Oh, yeah. I'm great!

495
00:38:57,567 --> 00:39:01,566
D'you need a tampon?

496
00:39:02,087 --> 00:39:06,086
D'you need me to show you how to
shove it up there?

497
00:39:09,567 --> 00:39:13,566
I'm good, thanks.

498
00:39:14,407 --> 00:39:18,406
You need to put them
on a hot wash, mate.

499
00:39:26,247 --> 00:39:27,766
So what're you going to do?

500
00:39:27,767 --> 00:39:31,766
I'm going to tell Emma.

501
00:39:31,927 --> 00:39:35,926
Ain't nothing else I can do.

502
00:39:40,367 --> 00:39:44,366
KNOCK ON DOOR

503
00:39:47,487 --> 00:39:49,206
Hey. Are you all right?

504
00:39:49,207 --> 00:39:51,806
Yes, I just thought you
were someone else.

505
00:39:51,807 --> 00:39:54,966
Oh? Listen before you go.

506
00:39:54,967 --> 00:39:57,726
We should talk about fixing up
some more training.

507
00:39:57,727 --> 00:40:00,831
One on one.

508
00:40:28,294 --> 00:40:30,253
Emma?

509
00:40:30,254 --> 00:40:32,773
Hi!

510
00:40:32,774 --> 00:40:34,573
Erm, I'm looking for Emma.

511
00:40:34,574 --> 00:40:38,573
She's out for a drink
with her coach.

512
00:40:48,614 --> 00:40:52,613
Just relax.

513
00:42:14,014 --> 00:42:18,013
What the fuck is going on?
How did I get here?

514
00:42:18,574 --> 00:42:19,773
Mark spiked you.

515
00:42:19,774 --> 00:42:23,773
Don't worry, I stopped him
before he really did anything.

516
00:42:26,534 --> 00:42:27,613
Where is he?

517
00:42:27,614 --> 00:42:29,053
Tied up in the boot of the car.

518
00:42:29,054 --> 00:42:31,133
He did the same to me last night.

519
00:42:31,134 --> 00:42:34,453
He spiked me. That's why
I was so out of it.

520
00:42:34,454 --> 00:42:38,453
What're you talking about?

521
00:42:39,054 --> 00:42:43,053
There's something
I need to show you.

522
00:42:47,414 --> 00:42:49,453
Curtis isn't shagging me.

523
00:42:49,454 --> 00:42:53,453
He isn't cheating on you,
and neither am I.

524
00:42:58,534 --> 00:43:02,533
This is totally insane.

525
00:43:05,214 --> 00:43:08,893
I just wanted to run.

526
00:43:08,894 --> 00:43:12,893
To feel it again... to feel...

527
00:43:13,774 --> 00:43:17,213
good about myself.

528
00:43:17,214 --> 00:43:20,493
Being her...

529
00:43:20,494 --> 00:43:23,533
it was the only way I could do it.

530
00:43:23,534 --> 00:43:27,533
I never meant for any of
this to happen, to hurt you.

531
00:43:32,734 --> 00:43:36,733
Thought I wanted it more than
anything. It's not worth this.

532
00:43:40,934 --> 00:43:44,933
I need to find something else
that makes me feel like that.

533
00:44:03,254 --> 00:44:05,213
What should we do with him?

534
00:44:05,214 --> 00:44:09,213
(SCREAMING)

535
00:45:01,534 --> 00:45:04,013
It was you, you've done this to me.

536
00:45:04,014 --> 00:45:07,013
No-one needs to know about that.
Next time you find a girl

537
00:45:07,014 --> 00:45:09,453
unconscious, you don't touch her.
You get it?

538
00:45:09,454 --> 00:45:12,333
I was checking on you.
It was you that was grabbing me,

539
00:45:12,334 --> 00:45:14,853
kissing me, pushing my head down.
I don't like that.

540
00:45:14,854 --> 00:45:16,693
Who's the real victim?

541
00:45:16,694 --> 00:45:17,973
You never heard "no means no"?

542
00:45:17,974 --> 00:45:20,293
You didn't say no.
You said, "Suck my nipples."

543
00:45:20,294 --> 00:45:24,293
I was spiked. You didn't think it
was strange when I called you Emma?

544
00:45:24,614 --> 00:45:28,333
People say all kinds of
weird shit during sex.

545
00:45:28,334 --> 00:45:32,333
I was fucking this bird, one time,
right, about to blow my load,

546
00:45:32,334 --> 00:45:36,333
and I went
"Auntie!" What's that all about?

547
00:45:37,214 --> 00:45:38,533
You should've known.

548
00:45:38,534 --> 00:45:40,893
Never look a gift horse
in the mouth.

549
00:45:40,894 --> 00:45:43,973
That's one fine looking gift horse
you've got.

550
00:45:43,974 --> 00:45:47,973
(COUGHS)

551
00:45:48,174 --> 00:45:49,733
Ooh, I've got it.

552
00:45:49,734 --> 00:45:52,173
Eugh, is that a pube?

553
00:45:52,174 --> 00:45:55,533
Mmm! D'you want it back?

554
00:45:55,534 --> 00:45:56,573
Did you...?

555
00:45:56,574 --> 00:46:00,573
For a bloke,
he's got a lovely pussy.

556
00:46:01,494 --> 00:46:05,493
Fuck it.

557
00:46:20,814 --> 00:46:23,373
Why are you
so obsessed with becoming him?

558
00:46:23,374 --> 00:46:24,733
I have to save you.

559
00:46:24,734 --> 00:46:27,653
But if you become him,
you're gonna leave me.

560
00:46:27,654 --> 00:46:28,653
You're the guy in the mask!

561
00:46:28,654 --> 00:46:29,813
You can't tell anyone.

562
00:46:29,814 --> 00:46:31,293
You have a future self?

563
00:46:31,294 --> 00:46:32,733
It's my destiny.

564
00:46:32,734 --> 00:46:34,453
That is so fucking cool.

565
00:46:34,454 --> 00:46:38,373
Being a super hero and
having a girlfriend, they don't mix.

566
00:46:38,374 --> 00:46:41,373
Where the fuck have you been
the past few weeks?

567
00:46:41,374 --> 00:46:43,613
I don't know what's going on!

568
00:46:43,614 --> 00:46:45,493
Simon, wait!

569
00:46:45,494 --> 00:46:47,999
One day you'll come to see that
I did it all for you.

570
00:46:48,024 --> 00:46:53,324
