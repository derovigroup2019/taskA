Look, are you going to do something
about this girl or not?

357
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:29,680
I really don't see that happening.

358

You don't give a shit about anyone,
do you?

359
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:36,120
I give a shit about me.

361
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:39,920
It's rubbish.

362
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:43,080

- Yeah, and you're a dick!

took the dog?

- The charity box, for the blind?

I really hate to be a grass,

375

but I did see
that strangely intense girl

376
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:37,920
with slightly inadequate breasts -
she was carrying something heavy

377
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:40,600
and dog-shaped
over to her locker before...

The probation worker's
looking for you.

384
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:18,920
And why's that?

385
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:21,040
Because he seems to be
under the impression

386
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:23,320
that you've stolen
a dog-shaped charity box,

387
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:25,920
on account of him having
found it in your locker.

527
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:20,560
Jesus!

528
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:24,080
I thought you were
at the police station...?

529
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:25,400
The police are going to have

530
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:29,520
a lot more important things to do
than look for me.

531
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:10,960
Oh, Jesus.

532
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:15,920
It wasn't me...

533
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:21,960
What did you do...?

534
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:26,080
I didn't do anything.

535
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:05,520
Oh!

536
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:09,600
Jesus! Shit!

537
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:15,320
- Well, this isn't good, is it?
- Why's she doing this?

538
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:17,520
I honestly have no idea.

539
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:19,920
I'll find out where she is.

540
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:22,680
Oh, brilliant. We'll just untie
your hands, slip off the noose,

541
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:23,840
and away you go.

542
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:27,644
No, my power! I can put myself
in other people's shoes.

543
00:39:27,764 --> 00:39:29,320
See what they see through their eyes.

544
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:31,800
Do you have to be
wearing their shoes?

545
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:35,840
No. Right. That'd be
ridiculous, wouldn't it?

546
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:51,320
- She's writing our suicide notes!
- Fuck...

547
00:39:54,680 --> 00:39:56,240
You don't have to do this!

548
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:59,320
Well, someone's going to get
blamed for stabbing Charlie.

549
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:01,240
And it's not going to be me.

550
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:05,200
What if we promise
not to tell anyone...?

551
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:08,400
But...if this is suicide,

552
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:12,200
how d'you explain our hands
being tied behind our backs?

553
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:14,680
I'll untie them when you're dead.

554
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:17,440
Hm. I'm glad you've
thought of everything.

555
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:21,480
Or should I say, nearly everything?

556
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,360
No, you're bluffing.

557
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:24,520
- Am I?
- Yeah!

558
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:27,880
I really wouldn't do that
if I were you. It's up to you.

559
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,640
Ooh, the irony.

560
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:33,480
You're gonna kick yourself.

561
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:35,360
What the fuck are you talking about?

562
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:36,440
It's hilarious. It's too funny.

563
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:39,600
What is it?

564
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:40,640
Tell me!

565
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:44,680
All right. It's this...

566
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:51,400
Rudy!

567
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:52,440
Wrap your legs round me.

568
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:55,800
I'll take your weight! Wrap
your legs around me! Come on!

569
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:58,120
I didn't mean to kill her!

570
00:40:58,280 --> 00:41:02,280
- You can't hold us...
- Just hold on.

571
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:04,400
No point in us both dying.

572
00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:06,680
Just hold on!

573
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:08,240
You broke my heart...

574
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:09,800
I know.

575
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:12,120
I lied.

576
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:14,800
I do remember you.

577
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:18,200
I was a bitch. I didn't care
who I hurt, but I've changed.

578
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:22,120
I'm not that person any more!

579
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:25,480
I hate myself for what I did to you.

580
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:26,680
I'm sorry.

581
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:29,960
That's good enough.

582
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:32,520
No! Rudy!

583
00:41:32,680 --> 00:41:35,440
Rudy! Help!

584
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:37,400
Somebody help us...!

585
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:41,520
(SCREAMS FADE)

586
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:10,920
I thought you'd gone to Wales?

587
00:42:18,080 --> 00:42:21,440
I've got to tell you, guys -
I'm kind of freaking out here,

588
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:24,680
all this killing
and burying and dying.

589
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:27,040
Just, I'm outside my comfort zone.

590
00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:31,160
If it makes you feel any better,
we've done a couple of people too.

591
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:34,160
Shit just happened.

592
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:37,640
You bury 'em,
just get on with your life.

593
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:41,760
I just...keep seeing this image
of her cute little face,

594
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:46,880
she's biting down
on the mattress, there.

595
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:51,560
She absolutely loved it up the arse.

596
00:42:51,720 --> 00:42:55,680
God rest her beautiful soul.

597
00:42:55,800 --> 00:42:59,880
Amen.

598
00:43:12,680 --> 00:43:16,320
Well, that could've
gone a lot worse, you know?

599
00:43:16,440 --> 00:43:19,000
For me.

600
00:43:19,120 --> 00:43:20,280
A new day tomorrow.

601
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:22,720
Who knows what it holds
for all of us.

602
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:24,720
(SIREN WAILS)

603
00:43:24,840 --> 00:43:25,840
Shit...

604
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:26,640
Just stay cool.

605
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:29,684
Don't get upset,
but this isn't exactly my car.

606
00:43:29,804 --> 00:43:31,760
- Whose car is it?
- Nicked it off a man with a perm.

607
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:34,840
A man, with a perm.
What's that about?

608
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,960
We can't get caught in no nicked
car. We're all on probation.

609
00:43:38,080 --> 00:43:42,080
Maybe they'll let you off
with a warning, love.

610
00:43:44,040 --> 00:43:45,320
Honestly, guys -

611
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:48,840
I thought they'd let you off
with a warning.

612
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:52,920
(SLOW HANDCLAP)

613
00:43:58,440 --> 00:44:02,160
That didn't take you long,
did it? Congratulations.

614
00:44:02,320 --> 00:44:04,680
You haven't changed.

615
00:44:04,840 --> 00:44:08,720
That's where you're wrong, because
I've found a new dedication

616
00:44:09,240 --> 00:44:13,240
to ensuring your complete
and total rehabilitation.

617
00:44:15,560 --> 00:44:18,480
I'll get started, right after I've
watched Homes Under the Hammer.

618
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:22,480
Ooh! Can we watch that with you?

619
00:44:22,600 --> 00:44:26,160
You lot can piss off
and do some work.

620
00:44:26,320 --> 00:44:30,200
Chop chop.

621
00:45:00,840 --> 00:45:03,720
- What you doing?
- Designing a new propulsion system.

622
00:45:03,880 --> 00:45:07,400
- Why?
- Because I'm a fucking rocket scientist.

623
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:10,680
Ah, are we doing catchphrases?

624
00:45:10,840 --> 00:45:14,720
Maybe we could all have one.
Mine could be, "Now you see me,

625
00:45:14,840 --> 00:45:16,400
"Now you see two of me".

626
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:17,880
Why do we need catchphrases?

627
00:45:18,040 --> 00:45:21,920
You know - for when
shit goes down, man.

628
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:25,880
C'mon. D'you really think we're
going to spend the next seven weeks

629
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:27,720
ambling around, picking up litter?

630
00:45:27,880 --> 00:45:31,520
- He's got a point.
- Maybe it'll be different this time.

631
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:34,080
Maybe there won't be
any shit going down.

632
00:45:34,200 --> 00:45:36,960
Oh, trust me.
There'll be shit.

633
00:45:37,120 --> 00:45:41,080
It's in the air.

634
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:45,200
I can smell it.

635
00:45:57,960 --> 00:45:59,840
So do you want to tell me
what's going on?

636
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,560
Why are we following him?
Oh, my God.

637
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:03,920
You fancy him!

638
00:46:04,080 --> 00:46:06,120
You're Curtis Donovan, aren't you?

639
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:07,240
So what is there to do round here?

640
00:46:07,400 --> 00:46:09,720
- Have you just had a shag?
- Something like that.

641
00:46:09,880 --> 00:46:11,520
Who's the lucky girl?

642
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:12,800
You don't know her.

643
00:46:13,080 --> 00:46:14,880
This was the worst sex
I have ever had.

644
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:17,880
When we were together, was I...?

645
00:46:18,040 --> 00:46:19,360
What? Was I shit?

646
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:21,920
What are you doing?
That's Curtis's locker.

647
00:46:22,080 --> 00:46:24,000
It's me, Curtis.

648
00:46:24,120 --> 00:46:28,120
This is how I look when I'm a girl.
