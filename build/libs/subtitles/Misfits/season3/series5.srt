you're not going outwith her, man.

349
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:24,007
Well, she's better than some of the skanky
horrible sluts you end up With.

350
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:26,281
She's old and she's a...psychopath

351
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:28,527
and she cries
after she's wanked people off.

352
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:31,450
She cries because she cares.
Unlike you.

353
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:32,891
No, you... Listen.

354
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:36,811
You don't get to choose. I choose.
And that's how this thing Works, right?

355
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:39,810
Now, you get back in here,
because I am not having people thinking

356
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:42,081
I'm fucking a 40-year-old woman.

357
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:43,201
No.

358
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:44,969
I love her.

359
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:48,482
And I don't care What you think.

360
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:52,327
Don't you Walk out this room.

361
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,411
Kelly?

362
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,729
Kelly!

363
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:15,765
What are you doing?

364
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:18,246
I just Wanted to come.

365
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:19,850
Why?

366
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:21,609
I... l dunno.

367
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:23,688
I'm not in there any more.
I'm right here.

368
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:25,966
So who <i>is</i> in there?

369
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,968
I don't know.

370
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,889
I've no idea.

371
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:31,968
Look, it just happened.

372
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,480
I was lying there, she came in
and we swapped.

373
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:36,409
That's not right, Jen.

374
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:39,171
So, what? You care more about
a girl that you've never met than me?

375
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:41,248
- No, of course I don't.
- Well, come on, seriously,

376
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:43,487
do you have any idea how sick I am
of being in this room?

377
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:44,851
Who is she, Jen?

378
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:47,281
Just forget about her!

379
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:50,163
I don't think I can.

380
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:52,605
OK, then.

381
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:54,761
What are you doing?

382
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:59,441
Turning her off. You'll have no choice,
you'll have to be with me.

383
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:02,290
You're not Jen.

384
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:06,285
You've changed.
I don't know who you are any more.

385
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:07,845
Dom, Wait!

386
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:12,529
- Look, Dom, I didn't plan any of this.
- Get off me.

387
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:14,608
Dom, please don't go!

388
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:17,330
I came back to you.

389
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:19,328
Yeah? Well, I don't want you.

390
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:21,203
I don't want you like this.

391
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:26,565
Get off her!

392
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:30,164
Are you OK?

393
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:33,606
- I think you should leave.
- Yeah, so do I.

394
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:35,324
ALISHA: Kelly?

395
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:36,725
Come on, let's go.

396
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:49,370
- Hello.
- Hiya.

397
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:52,529
Er, just so you know, I've been having
a bit of a think about us...

398
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:56,007
Yeah, it's not gonna happen, right?
I mean, listen,

399
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:58,441
thanks for the hand job
and the sex and all that.

400
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:00,528
Brilliant. But you are...

401
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:01,925
You're quite old

402
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:04,486
and you cry...

403
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:06,249
a lot, hm?

404
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:09,721
Bye, then.

405
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:14,680

406
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:20,089
(DOOR OPENS)

407
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:28,327
Who was the guy at the hospital?

408
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:30,249
Oh, I don't wanna talk about it.

409
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:38,083
Well, you should get changed
before the probation worker gets back.

410
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:56,326
Where were you last night?

411
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:57,805
Kelly, What happened?

412
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:59,410
You didn't even text me.

413
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:00,680
I was busy.

414
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:02,529
What, that's it? That's the best
you can come up with?

415
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:05,404
Will you just fuck off
and stop following me?

416
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:19,251
Hiya.

417
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:20,281
What?

418
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:23,449
I've...I've booked a table.

419
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:25,289
Do you like Italian food?

420
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:27,482
Are you taking the piss?

421
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:29,409
No. I'm not...

422
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:31,090
taking...taking the piss?

423
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:32,201
Prick!

424
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:35,081
Aaarghh!

425
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:37,202
Guys... Guys.

426
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:40,564
What's going on with Kelly?

427
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:42,125
How do you mean?

428
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:43,924
Well, she won't talk to me.

429
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:46,521
Can someone tell me What's going on?

430
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:49,200
Um...

431
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:50,924
Well, there was this guy.

432
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:53,361
- What, she's seeing someone else?
- No.

433
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:55,721
There's this guy in the hospital.
She had a fight with him.

434
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:56,841
Why?

435
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:59,690
I dunno. She won't talk about it.

436
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:01,609
Right, well, we need to find her.

437
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:04,803
Well...do your power thing,
find out where she is.

438
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:05,966
OK.

439
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:17,083
NURSE: Dr Jones is on her way.

440
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:23,330
(PANTS)

441
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:25,806
What? What is it?

442
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:29,162
Well, she's in the hospital.
I think it's serious.

443
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:36,207
Dom!

444
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:47,601
Check again. Kelly Bailey -
five foot five, medium build.

445
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:49,085
Move.

446
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:52,886
Wears her hair pulled back, like, all...
like, all the way back, like that.

447
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:54,968
RECEPTIONIST: Sorry.
It's not coming up with anything.

448
00:29:57,880 --> 00:30:00,770
It's the Woman I saw. That way.

449
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:13,642
ALISHA: This is the room.

450
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:16,365
OK. That's not Kelly.

451
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:19,930
No, but she is sexy though, hm!

452
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:23,520
For a coma victim, she is.

453
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:26,650
Do it again.

454
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:37,205
It's her.

455
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:39,447
She's in there.

456
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:40,641
Who is?

457
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:42,489
Kelly. That's Kelly.

458
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:45,410
It's a body-swap.

459
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,241
They must've switched places.

460
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:50,770
Oh, my God.

461
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:54,726
This is like that film...

462
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:57,331
with Nicolas Cage in.

463
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:58,566
<i>Face/Off.</i>

464
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:00,648
Face/Off Wasn't a body-swap -

465
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:02,444
they had surgery to look like each other.

466
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:03,481
Oh.

467
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:06,927
<i>This is more like Freaky Friday.</i>

468
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:09,088
- It is...
- Who gives a shit?

469
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:10,565
What are we gonna do about Kelly?

470
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:12,762
Right, come on. Come on. Come on.

471
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:14,325
All right.

472
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:15,771
Why don't you check this out?

473
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:16,801
Wake up!

474
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:19,011
Wake up!

475
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:20,405
Wake... Wake up!

476
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:21,566
What are you doing?

477
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:23,887
I'm wake... I'm waking her up.

478
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:25,922
Don't you think if it was that simple
they might have tried that already?

479
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:27,291
Maybe they hadn't thought of that,
so why don't you just...

480
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:28,321
Wake up!

481
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:31,204
You're faking it, we all know it. We...

482
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:35,449
Oh. I didn't know she had visitors.

483
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:36,720
Are you family?

484
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:38,489
I'm her brother.

485
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:42,923
Could I have a word?

486
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:46,644
(WHISPERS) Dickhead!

487
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:48,330
Oooh, eh!

488
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:51,489
I've just spoken to your mother.

489
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:53,682
I don't know if she's told you yet.

490
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:58,123
She's made the decision
to turn Jen's ventilator off.

491
00:31:58,160 --> 00:31:59,730
You may want to say goodbye.

492
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:03,248
No, you...you can't do that.

493
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:04,805
I'm sorry.

494
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:12,610
They're shutting her down.

495
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:13,846
What?

496
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:17,162
They're turning off her life support.

497
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:19,601
- We need to steal the body.
- Oh!

498
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:20,766
What are you saying?

499
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:23,167
If she dies, Kelly dies.

500
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:25,089
- OK, let's pack her up.
- And where we gonna take her?

501
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:26,690
The community centre.

502
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:28,848
The community centre. Brilliant.

503
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:31,804
Cos that is the perfect place
to take a girl in a coma, innit?

504
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:35,561
Right, you take the beepy thing, the
breathing thing and the piss-bag thing.

505
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:40,921
Hiya, hello.
I'm just visiting me grandad,

506
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:43,122
and I'm pretty sure
he's prolapsed his anus.

507
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:46,289
I mean, I'm not an expert or anything
but it's very much looking that way.

508
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:48,004
Could you just come
and have a quick look for me?

509
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:49,280
- Yeah.
- Nice one, cheers.

510
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:51,482
He's just down here,
he's in a terrible way.

511
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:52,851
- Really painful for him.
- OK.

512
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:56,123
Just prod him in the stomach
or something. Just there.

513
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:14,650
On, sh...!

514
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:16,250
Oi!

515
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:23,881
- Whoa, whoa...

517
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:36,360
Come on.

518
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:40,643
(ALARM BLARES)

519
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:42,364
Shit!

520
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:50,367
Grab her hand.

521
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:57,048
Can you just hurry up, yeah?

522
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:05,611
Wait! Wait!

523
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:08,489
Come on, let me just...

524
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:09,806
- Get in the front!
- Rudy!

525
