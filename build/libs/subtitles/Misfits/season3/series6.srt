1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:01,779
I most certainly did.

2
00:00:01,780 --> 00:00:04,219
And she loved it!
What if she's got HIV?

3
00:00:04,220 --> 00:00:06,779
Cute girls don't get HIV!

4
00:00:06,780 --> 00:00:09,659
Thanks for the hand job,
but you're quite old

5
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:11,979
and you cry a lot.

6
00:00:11,980 --> 00:00:14,139
She was me first, Clare.

7
00:00:14,140 --> 00:00:18,139
He just sleeps with people,
he's out of there before he's had
time to take his condom off.

8
00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:23,099
This turning into a girl thing, is
that born out of some sort of sexual
confusion?

9
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:25,619
You ain't lived
until you've had a multiple orgasm.

10
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:29,259
All over your body,
like waves of pleasure.

11
00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:31,219
Were you... wanking?

12
00:00:31,220 --> 00:00:32,659
So what if I was?

13
00:00:32,660 --> 00:00:33,939
I think you've got your period.

14
00:00:33,940 --> 00:00:36,139
No-one needs to see that.

15
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:40,779
Why did she stab me?
What did I ever do to her?

16
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:42,099
That wasn't Kelly.

17
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:44,059
She's swapped bodies.

18
00:00:44,060 --> 00:00:48,059
You'll be fine.

19
00:00:54,380 --> 00:00:58,379
All right?

20
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:05,579
Top party! You are pretty.
You've got nice...

21
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:07,219
What are them? These here.

22
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:10,859
They're c-collarbones!

23
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:14,579
Do you mind if I smell your hair?
Or is that a bit creepy?

24
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:18,579
Bit creepy. Mm!

25
00:01:18,860 --> 00:01:22,859
All right? You know,
you have really slim ankles!

26
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:25,939
Yeah, that smells like, er...

27
00:01:25,940 --> 00:01:29,139
smells like Ready Brek.

28
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:32,779
Sexy bone, that.
Very... very underrated bone, innit?

29
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:36,779
Mm.

30
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:40,299
I'll tell you who's got
the best ankles... the Chinese.

31
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:42,779
Because you never see a Chinese woman
with fat ankles, do you?

32
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:44,339
I love Ready Brek, me.

33
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:45,779
It's the, er...

34
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:49,779
it's the breakfast of champions.

35
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:57,499
Whoo!

36
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:05,179
Mmm...

37
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:08,579
Whoa, whoa! What is that?!
What is that?

38
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:12,579
Oh!
Have we got any use for that? No?

39
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:14,859
Wait.
What?

40
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:16,219
I don't wanna do this if it's just
gonna be a one-night thing.

41
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:18,859
No, no, no, no. Course not.
I'm sick of guys treating me like shit.

42
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:21,179
Yeah, I know. Yeah, yeah.
You promise you'll call me tomorrow?

43
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:25,019
Love, I promise. I promise you
I am not one of them guys.

44
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:27,899
That's it now. Oh, it's on!

45
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:30,659
It is on! Sweet child o' mine!
Oh!

46
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:31,979
Are you ready?

47
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:34,539
Yeah?

48
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:56,299
Ooh! Hoo-ooh! Oooh!

49
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:05,059
Nice one for that! I needed it.

50
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:07,779
Oh! Listen, I, er...

51
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:10,699
I think you're wonderful
and everything, but, er...

52
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:12,899
I think it's only fair to say
I won't be calling you.

53
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:16,619
What?! So you just fuck me and
leave? You said you weren't one of
those guys?

54
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:18,459
Yeah, I lied. Have...

55
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:20,259
Whoa, whoa!

56
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:21,699
Ohh! Easy, tiger!

57
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:25,539
Ahhh! Oh!

58
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:28,459
It was nice knowing you and
everything.

59
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:32,459
Wanker.

60
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:45,760
<font color="#3399CC">Subtitles by Red Bee Media Ltd, MemoryOnSmells</font>

61
00:04:20,579 --> 00:04:24,458
She was nice.
She was a... nice... nice girl.

62
00:04:24,459 --> 00:04:28,458
Nice and pretty.

63
00:04:29,739 --> 00:04:31,258
I've gotta be honest...
I don't really remember.

64
00:04:31,259 --> 00:04:34,978
You can't remember someone
you had sex with? Classy!

65
00:04:34,979 --> 00:04:36,378
Well, she was certainly happy
with the service.

66
00:04:36,379 --> 00:04:39,898
Look what old Rudy found
in his jeans this morning.

67
00:04:39,899 --> 00:04:42,538
The digits!

68
00:04:42,539 --> 00:04:44,178
So are you going to call her?

69
00:04:44,179 --> 00:04:47,578
No! No, I'm not.
And I'll tell you why.

70
00:04:47,579 --> 00:04:50,698
When you buy a dog, right,

71
00:04:50,699 --> 00:04:53,738
you know that one day,
the dog, it'll grow old

72
00:04:53,739 --> 00:04:55,538
and it'll die. Oh!

73
00:04:55,539 --> 00:04:57,498
And you're gonna be...
you're just gonna be heartbroken.

74
00:04:57,499 --> 00:04:59,258
Cos you loved that dog,
he was just a cheeky little scamp.

75
00:04:59,259 --> 00:05:03,258
Here's an idea. Don't buy
the fucking dog in the first place.

76
00:05:03,499 --> 00:05:05,458
Save everyone the bastard hassle.

77
00:05:05,459 --> 00:05:07,858
Right.
All I'm saying is,

78
00:05:07,859 --> 00:05:09,978
it's better that I make her cry
a little bit now

79
00:05:09,979 --> 00:05:13,018
than break her heart in three years'
time when she's totally in love
with me

80
00:05:13,019 --> 00:05:15,058
and we've bought
a load of shitty furniture together.

81
00:05:15,059 --> 00:05:19,058
It's... it's just the humane thing
to do, isn't it?

82
00:05:19,859 --> 00:05:21,498
You prick.
I know.

83
00:05:21,499 --> 00:05:23,578
What are we doing today?
We're doing nothing.

84
00:05:23,579 --> 00:05:26,338
The probation worker's dead.
Oh, yeah.

85
00:05:26,339 --> 00:05:29,338
Do we even need to be here?
If the probation worker goes missing

86
00:05:29,339 --> 00:05:31,178
and we don't turn up to community
service, it looks suspicious.

87
00:05:31,179 --> 00:05:32,898
Whoa, whoa.

88
00:05:32,899 --> 00:05:34,978
Shh-shh-shh-shh!

89
00:05:34,979 --> 00:05:38,058
What was that?

90
00:05:38,059 --> 00:05:42,058
I can't hear anything.

91
00:05:43,339 --> 00:05:47,338
There!
You must... you must've heard that?

92
00:05:49,659 --> 00:05:51,618
Bingo!

93
00:05:51,619 --> 00:05:54,258
It's the fucking ice-cream van!
Right, who wants what?

94
00:05:54,259 --> 00:05:57,138
Who wants what? Come on!
You... c-c-come with me!

95
00:05:57,139 --> 00:06:00,138
I need an extra pair of hands.
Curtis!

96
00:06:00,139 --> 00:06:03,978
Come...! Curtis!

97
00:06:03,979 --> 00:06:05,498
Come on.

98
00:06:22,419 --> 00:06:24,018
Oi!

99
00:06:24,019 --> 00:06:25,698
I said...

100
00:06:25,699 --> 00:06:27,458
ice cream!
Ice-cream van's here!

101
00:06:27,459 --> 00:06:29,978
What you having?
Look, don't worry about money.

102
00:06:29,979 --> 00:06:31,738
We'll sort all that out later.
Fuck off!

103
00:06:31,739 --> 00:06:34,418
Well, you'll be sorry, won't you,
when you've not got an ice cream

104
00:06:34,419 --> 00:06:36,258
and I'll, mm,
and I'll be licking an ice cream?

105
00:06:36,259 --> 00:06:38,098
You won't have anything.
You won't have anything!

106
00:06:42,859 --> 00:06:45,418
I'm gonna have to go inside.

107
00:06:45,419 --> 00:06:47,098
D'you have to?
Well, they always send

108
00:06:47,099 --> 00:06:49,098
a new probation worker
after we've killed one.

109
00:06:55,019 --> 00:06:58,498
Do you wanna come in?

110
00:06:58,499 --> 00:07:02,058
Yeah, all right.

111
00:07:06,619 --> 00:07:08,378
Hi.
Hi.

112
00:07:08,379 --> 00:07:12,378
I might...

113
00:07:12,379 --> 00:07:13,658
I, um...

114
00:07:13,659 --> 00:07:16,178
I... I'd like some ice cream.

115
00:07:16,179 --> 00:07:17,578
Good, cos I sell those.

116
00:07:18,939 --> 00:07:20,418
Right.

117
00:07:20,419 --> 00:07:21,938
Um...

118
00:07:21,939 --> 00:07:23,378
Three cones.

119
00:07:23,379 --> 00:07:24,898
And, um...

120
00:07:24,899 --> 00:07:27,338
and a rainbow lolly thing.

121
00:07:27,339 --> 00:07:29,378
D'you want some nuts and sauce?

122
00:07:29,379 --> 00:07:30,818
Nuts!

123
00:07:30,819 --> 00:07:32,178
Give me some nu...

124
00:07:32,179 --> 00:07:33,858
Whoa! Give me some nuts,

125
00:07:33,859 --> 00:07:36,058
extra sauce and a Flake, please.

126
00:07:36,059 --> 00:07:39,178
It's a buzzin' day, innit, man?

127
00:07:39,179 --> 00:07:40,418
No work, eh,

128
00:07:40,419 --> 00:07:43,058
nuts, extra sauce and a Flake.

129
00:07:43,059 --> 00:07:44,338
Could this day get any better?

130
00:07:44,339 --> 00:07:46,978
What?!

131
00:07:46,979 --> 00:07:48,178
What?

132
00:07:48,179 --> 00:07:51,538
Oh, hello.

133
00:07:51,539 --> 00:07:54,098
Hi.

134
00:07:54,099 --> 00:07:56,418
Where's your mate?

135
00:07:56,419 --> 00:07:57,338
He...

136
00:07:57,339 --> 00:07:59,298
had to make a call.

137
00:07:59,299 --> 00:08:01,698
Oh.

138
00:08:01,699 --> 00:08:03,498
There's your first two.

139
00:08:03,499 --> 00:08:07,498
Give. Give 'em.

140
00:08:14,819 --> 00:08:17,498
So... what was that all about,

141
00:08:17,499 --> 00:08:20,458
the whole... sex-change-switch thing?

142
00:08:20,459 --> 00:08:22,818
Dunno. Just happened.

143
00:08:22,819 --> 00:08:25,858
Well, may I just say, you're looking
particularly fine today.

144
00:08:25,859 --> 00:08:27,818
Me, personally,

145
00:08:27,819 --> 00:08:30,618
I could never get tired
of looking at that arse...

146
00:08:30,619 --> 00:08:31,698
Is that right?

147
00:08:31,699 --> 00:08:32,698
Right, now, you're gonna
have to tell me

148
00:08:32,699 --> 00:08:34,858
when you're gonna change like that,
mate, eh?

149
00:08:34,859 --> 00:08:36,258
It's horrible.

150
00:08:36,259 --> 00:08:40,258
Here.

151
00:08:43,219 --> 00:08:45,498
Hmmm...

152
00:08:56,099 --> 00:09:00,098
What the fuck is that?

153
00:09:02,059 --> 00:09:05,618
It fucking came off!
Me fucking dick's come off, man!

154
00:09:05,619 --> 00:09:08,538
That's what happens when you fuck me
and then just walk away.

155
00:09:08,539 --> 00:09:10,018
Have you done this to me?

156
00:09:10,019 --> 00:09:13,018
I'm not gonna let guys like you
do shit like this to me any more.

157
00:09:13,019 --> 00:09:15,138
Well, fuckin' pack it in ice, man!

158
00:09:15,139 --> 00:09:16,738
Oh, you dick! Look what you've done!

159
00:09:16,739 --> 00:09:20,338
D-D-D-Don't step on it!

160
00:09:20,339 --> 00:09:24,338
Take this.

161
00:09:29,859 --> 00:09:33,378
Is there... is there something wrong
with your penis?

162
00:09:33,379 --> 00:09:34,978
Jesus!
I know!

163
00:09:34,979 --> 00:09:37,138
Christ!
Dude, that is like

164
00:09:37,139 --> 00:09:39,298
no STD I have ever seen.

165
00:09:39,299 --> 00:09:41,418
And trust me, mate, I've seen 'em,
I've seen 'em all.

166
00:09:41,419 --> 00:09:44,658
It's a power thing. That... girl
you slept with, she gave it to you.

167
00:09:44,659 --> 00:09:46,498
How do you know?

168
00:09:46,499 --> 00:09:48,018
I saw the future. Put...

169
00:09:48,019 --> 00:09:52,018
Oh, sorry. Yeah. Well, what happened?

170
00:09:52,259 --> 00:09:53,258
It... it came off.

171
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:54,778
What came off?
Your cock.

172
00:09:54,779 --> 00:09:58,098
My cock came off?
Yes. Then someone stood on it.

173
00:09:58,099 --> 00:10:02,098
- My cock came...! Well...
- I do not wanna live without my cock.

174
00:10:02,539 --> 00:10:04,978
That's just one version of the
future. We can change it.

175
00:10:04,979 --> 00:10:06,218
How?

176
00:10:06,219 --> 00:10:08,218
She said it was a punishment for
sleeping with her and walking away.

177
00:10:08,219 --> 00:10:09,458
Right!

178
00:10:09,459 --> 00:10:13,458
So I just need to fuck her again,
and my cock'll go back to normal,
won't it?

179
00:10:15,499 --> 00:10:18,058
I think so. I'm not sure.
I need to find her

180
00:10:18,059 --> 00:10:20,498
and shag her right now.

181
00:10:20,499 --> 00:10:21,858
You have her number.

182
00:10:21,859 --> 00:10:23,898
Ooh, f...

183
00:10:23,899 --> 00:10:27,898
Shit! Fuck!

184
00:10:40,939 --> 00:10:42,738
Really?
What did you expect?

185
00:10:42,739 --> 00:10:46,738
It's not a five-star hotel.

186
00:10:46,979 --> 00:10:49,298
Well, I mean, we can always leave
it, if you want.

187
00:10:49,299 --> 00:10:50,578
No!

188
00:10:50,579 --> 00:10:54,578
Come here.

189
00:11:04,659 --> 00:11:07,698
Right, so...

190
00:11:07,699 --> 00:11:09,338
read out the numbers...
I'm gonna dial it.

191
00:11:09,339 --> 00:11:11,578
Zero...
That's a start.

192
00:11:11,579 --> 00:11:14,338
Come on.

193
00:11:14,339 --> 00:11:16,538
Double seven, double zero,
nine, double zero.

194
00:11:16,539 --> 00:11:17,978
That's all we've got.

195
00:11:17,979 --> 00:11:19,498
W...
We're missing the last two.

196
00:11:19,499 --> 00:11:22,018
Right, well, I'm gonna have
to try every combination
till I get the right one,

197
00:11:22,019 --> 00:11:25,538
aren't I?

198
00:11:25,539 --> 00:11:28,738
Hello! My name's Rudy. I was just
wondering if you can help me.

199
00:11:28,739 --> 00:11:31,978
Did I have sex with you last night?
Because I...

200
00:11:31,979 --> 00:11:33,218
Hello?

201
00:11:33,219 --> 00:11:35,098
Hell...? Hello?

202
00:11:35,099 --> 00:11:37,058
Well, I'm sorry, but how rude's that?

203
00:11:37,059 --> 00:11:38,458
Eh?

204
00:11:38,459 --> 00:11:40,338
Unbelievable.

205
00:11:40,339 --> 00:11:42,858
Hello! It's Rudy.

206
00:11:42,859 --> 00:11:44,738
Um, basically... No...

207
00:11:44,739 --> 00:11:46,338
No, no, no, no, no. Not right now.

208
00:11:46,339 --> 00:11:48,978
I'm on the phone.
Um, yeah, just a quick question.

209
00:11:48,979 --> 00:11:52,978
Did I have sex with you last night?

210
00:11:54,299 --> 00:11:57,058
Hell...? Fuck!

211
00:11:57,059 --> 00:11:59,418
I'm not even gonna ask.

212
00:11:59,419 --> 00:12:01,898
This isn't going to work.

213
00:12:01,899 --> 00:12:05,378
You need to try and remember
what happened last night.

214
00:12:05,379 --> 00:12:08,578
There was one gi... two gi...
there was... There was three girls.

215
00:12:08,579 --> 00:12:10,578
There was definitely three.

216
00:12:10,579 --> 00:12:13,738
So it's one in three.
What were their names?

217
00:12:13,739 --> 00:12:17,738
I've no idea.
What did they look like?

218
00:12:19,819 --> 00:12:23,818
Ankles.

219
00:12:24,739 --> 00:12:28,738
Collarbones.

220
00:12:29,779 --> 00:12:32,658
Ready Brek.

221
00:12:32,659 --> 00:12:33,898
Ready Brek?

222
00:12:33,899 --> 00:12:36,538
If you've nothing constructive to say,

223
00:12:36,539 --> 00:12:38,178
then please, man, shut the fuck up.

224
00:12:38,179 --> 00:12:40,058
We should retrace your steps,

225
00:12:40,059 --> 00:12:42,178
go back to the house,
see if she's still there.

226
00:12:42,179 --> 00:12:43,178
Yes! See this guy?

227
00:12:43,179 --> 00:12:44,538
He's good!

228
00:12:45,859 --> 00:12:48,178
You're a logic guy, and I can...
I really can respect that.

229
00:12:48,179 --> 00:12:50,818
I bet you're really good at
Battleships, aren't you?

230
00:12:50,819 --> 00:12:53,828
Anyway, stop chatting.
We've gotta save me cock.

231
00:12:59,252 --> 00:13:01,151
This is it.

232
00:13:01,208 --> 00:13:05,207
Definitely.

233
00:13:21,989 --> 00:13:23,388
Where did you see her last?

234
00:13:23,752 --> 00:13:27,751
Bedroom.

235
00:13:47,752 --> 00:13:49,351
Here, man, it's her.

236
00:13:49,352 --> 00:13:52,671
Are you certain
you have the right room?

237
00:13:52,672 --> 00:13:54,111
Have we got any use for that?

238
00:13:54,112 --> 00:13:57,551
Yeah, man, I'm telling you, that is
her. That's definitely her.

239
00:13:57,552 --> 00:13:59,631
OK.

240
00:13:59,632 --> 00:14:02,071
So you just need to wake her up,

241
00:14:02,072 --> 00:14:03,751
talk to her

242
00:14:03,752 --> 00:14:05,991
and try to have sex with her.

243
00:14:05,992 --> 00:14:07,431
Or...

244
00:14:07,432 --> 00:14:09,031
Or what?

245
00:14:09,032 --> 00:14:10,991
Well, I mean, do I need...

246
00:14:10,992 --> 00:14:13,551
to wake her up?
Is that bit important?

247
00:14:13,552 --> 00:14:14,231
What d'you mean?

248
00:14:14,232 --> 00:14:15,591
Well...

249
00:14:15,592 --> 00:14:17,271
I dunno. Can't I just slip it
in there

250
00:14:17,272 --> 00:14:18,911
and give her a little
sleepy-fuck?

251
00:14:18,912 --> 00:14:20,311
That's rape.

252
00:14:21,912 --> 00:14:23,671
Is it?

253
00:14:23,672 --> 00:14:25,671
Yes!

254
00:14:25,672 --> 00:14:27,431
I'm not sure... that's a grey area,
dude.

255
00:14:27,432 --> 00:14:29,351
No, it isn't.

256
00:14:29,352 --> 00:14:31,311
Oh! What a dick!

257
00:14:31,312 --> 00:14:32,991
You've woke her up, man!

258
00:14:32,992 --> 00:14:35,111
Just wait here and just...

259
00:14:35,112 --> 00:14:37,671
make sure no-one comes in, yeah?

260
00:14:37,672 --> 00:14:39,351
Hello!

261
00:14:39,352 --> 00:14:41,311
Why are you still here?

262
00:14:41,312 --> 00:14:42,631
I get it.

263
00:14:42,632 --> 00:14:44,831
You're angry at me for walking out
on you.

264
00:14:44,832 --> 00:14:47,431
It was a joke!
It was a practical joke.

265
00:14:47,432 --> 00:14:50,311
And now here I am,
with these lovely flowers, look!

266
00:14:50,312 --> 00:14:53,471
I don't need flowers.
I need fucking painkillers!

267
00:14:53,472 --> 00:14:54,511
My head's killing me.

268
00:14:54,512 --> 00:14:55,551
Look, listen, right.

269
00:14:55,552 --> 00:14:56,951
I think... I think I'm fall...

270
00:14:56,952 --> 00:14:58,831
Stop it.

271
00:14:58,832 --> 00:15:00,671
I think I'm falling for you.

272
00:15:00,672 --> 00:15:01,991
Do you understand?

273
00:15:01,992 --> 00:15:04,351
Yeah? I think you might be the one.

274
00:15:04,352 --> 00:15:06,111
Can I have my tablets back?

275
00:15:06,112 --> 00:15:08,471
Last night, when we fucked...

276
00:15:08,472 --> 00:15:12,271
made love, whatever...
our souls joined together.

277
00:15:12,272 --> 00:15:16,271
Yeah? And here's the big news...

278
00:15:16,792 --> 00:15:20,791
I want to be your boyfriend.

279
00:15:35,792 --> 00:15:38,351
We'll settle down, we'll get an
'ouse. In the weekends,

280
00:15:38,352 --> 00:15:40,991
we'll go to Homebase, and in the
evenings,

281
00:15:40,992 --> 00:15:43,151
we'll cuddle up and watch
DVDs...

282
00:15:43,152 --> 00:15:47,151
All that can be yours.

283
00:15:47,512 --> 00:15:50,911
Shall we seal the deal with a bit
of sex?

284
00:15:50,912 --> 00:15:54,911
Why would I want to be your
girlfriend?

285
00:15:55,432 --> 00:15:56,831
Because you're a girl.

286
00:15:56,832 --> 00:15:58,071
It's what you lot want, isn't it?

287
00:15:58,072 --> 00:16:00,711
No.

288
00:16:00,712 --> 00:16:02,471
Anyway, I never slept with you.

289
00:16:02,472 --> 00:16:03,711
You did...

290
00:16:03,712 --> 00:16:04,791
I think I know who I had sex with.

291
00:16:04,792 --> 00:16:08,791
Well, how come I rock up here
at the scene of the crime

292
00:16:08,952 --> 00:16:11,271
and you're still in bed?

293
00:16:11,272 --> 00:16:12,711
Because I live here.

294
00:16:12,712 --> 00:16:14,311
Because this is my bed.

295
00:16:14,312 --> 00:16:15,831
Right...

296
00:16:15,832 --> 00:16:17,991
So you fucked someone in my bed?

297
00:16:17,992 --> 00:16:20,231
I need to leave.

298
00:16:20,232 --> 00:16:23,391
Are you... are you a doctor or summat?

299
00:16:23,392 --> 00:16:24,431
I'm a trainee.

300
00:16:24,432 --> 00:16:25,511
That'll do.

301
00:16:25,512 --> 00:16:27,751
I need an expert medical opinion
on something...

302
00:16:27,752 --> 00:16:28,471
Out you come.

303
00:16:30,552 --> 00:16:32,671
Simon! Simon, dude, it's not her.

304
00:16:32,672 --> 00:16:34,711
We need to get a move on, mate.

305
00:16:34,712 --> 00:16:35,711
What happened?

306
00:16:35,712 --> 00:16:37,191
I've just shown it to her.
It's gone black.

307
00:16:37,192 --> 00:16:39,111
It is not pretty down there,
my friend.

308
00:16:39,112 --> 00:16:43,111
All right, love, I'm Rudy.

309
00:16:43,152 --> 00:16:45,951
I think I know who it might be.

310
00:16:45,952 --> 00:16:47,471
Ooh, have I had sex with her?

311
00:16:47,472 --> 00:16:48,911
Wow.

312
00:16:48,912 --> 00:16:51,231
Do you know this girl?

313
00:16:51,232 --> 00:16:53,351
That's Amy Goodwin.

314
00:16:53,352 --> 00:16:54,511
Do you know where she lives?

315
00:17:05,352 --> 00:17:08,111
Never thought I'd say this...
I'm actually kind of bored.

316
00:17:08,112 --> 00:17:09,191
Ring the Council if you want,

317
00:17:09,192 --> 00:17:10,951
get them to hurry up
with the new probation worker.

318
00:17:10,952 --> 00:17:12,271
You're all right.

319
00:17:24,992 --> 00:17:26,911
Oh, hi.

320
00:17:26,912 --> 00:17:29,191
Not again.

321
00:17:29,192 --> 00:17:31,551
I keep randomly changing.

322
00:17:31,552 --> 00:17:33,311
Something's going on with my power.

323
00:17:33,312 --> 00:17:36,511
And my tits, they're really sore.

324
00:17:36,512 --> 00:17:37,671
Be honest...

325
00:17:37,672 --> 00:17:40,511
is this just an excuse
for being shit at table football?

326
00:17:40,512 --> 00:17:44,511
They're fucking killing me.
Is that normal?

327
00:17:52,392 --> 00:17:54,391
So...

328
00:17:54,392 --> 00:17:57,231
this is community service, is it?

329
00:17:57,232 --> 00:18:01,231
Yeah. It's usually much more shit
than this.

330
00:18:03,912 --> 00:18:05,711
Have you got a passport?

331
00:18:05,712 --> 00:18:07,231
What?

332
00:18:07,232 --> 00:18:09,151
Why do you want my passport?

333
00:18:09,152 --> 00:18:10,831
I thought we could go away together.

334
00:18:10,832 --> 00:18:13,831
What, like on holiday?

335
00:18:13,832 --> 00:18:17,031
Yeah. I was going to go on my own,
but...

336
00:18:17,032 --> 00:18:19,551
I was thinking Morocco,
somewhere like that.

337
00:18:19,552 --> 00:18:21,071
What's in Morocco?

338
00:18:21,072 --> 00:18:25,071
It's just somewhere to go.
Somewhere different.

339
00:18:26,672 --> 00:18:30,671
I've got my community service.

340
00:18:31,792 --> 00:18:35,791
It doesn't matter. Don't worry about
it if you're not interested.

341
00:18:36,552 --> 00:18:40,551
I'll think about it.

342
00:18:49,312 --> 00:18:52,111
Hang on a minute.

343
00:18:52,112 --> 00:18:56,111
Let me have a wee before we start.

344
00:18:57,312 --> 00:18:58,871
Who says romance is dead?

345
00:18:58,872 --> 00:19:00,751
Fuck off.

346
00:19:00,752 --> 00:19:04,751
Go on then, go for your wee.

347
00:19:24,872 --> 00:19:27,271
What's it doing?

348
00:19:27,272 --> 00:19:31,271
It's not doing anything...

349
00:19:47,272 --> 00:19:49,911
I'm pregnant.

350
00:20:22,912 --> 00:20:26,911
It's really starting to hurt,
this is, mate.

351
00:20:27,112 --> 00:20:28,231
This is her flat.

352
00:20:28,232 --> 00:20:29,791
OK.

353
00:20:29,792 --> 00:20:31,751
OK, biatch.

354
00:20:31,752 --> 00:20:33,831
It is frigging payback time.

355
00:20:33,832 --> 00:20:35,951
I'm going to fuck her so hard, man,

356
00:20:35,952 --> 00:20:39,151
I am going to fuck her
into the middle of next week.

357
00:20:39,152 --> 00:20:43,151
I'm going to fuck her so hard
she's going to be like a...

358
00:20:49,672 --> 00:20:52,671
That wasn't her.

359
00:20:52,672 --> 00:20:55,111
At least, I don't think it was.

360
00:20:55,112 --> 00:20:57,151
Can't have been that drunk.

361
00:20:57,152 --> 00:20:58,791
I think we need to leave.

362
00:20:58,792 --> 00:21:02,791
No! Whoa! No!
We are going nowhere, pal.

363
00:21:06,672 --> 00:21:08,031
Hello...

364
00:21:08,032 --> 00:21:09,751
Amy Goodwin.

365
00:21:09,752 --> 00:21:11,751
How are... how are things?

366
00:21:11,752 --> 00:21:14,071
Did you just flash your cock
at my sister?

367
00:21:14,072 --> 00:21:17,831
No.

368
00:21:17,832 --> 00:21:19,111
Yeah, I did, yeah.

369
00:21:19,112 --> 00:21:20,671
What the fuck do you think
you're doing?

370
00:21:20,672 --> 00:21:22,231
She's in there now,
crying her eyes out!

371
00:21:22,232 --> 00:21:26,231
It was a simple misunderstanding.
I thought she was you.

372
00:21:26,552 --> 00:21:28,951
What are even you doing here?

373
00:21:28,952 --> 00:21:32,671
Flowers.

374
00:21:32,672 --> 00:21:35,751
Because you're... my flower.

375
00:21:35,752 --> 00:21:38,351
Right.

376
00:21:38,352 --> 00:21:39,591
Look, if this is about last night...

377
00:21:39,592 --> 00:21:40,871
Yeah,

378
00:21:40,872 --> 00:21:42,431
look, I apologise for that.

379
00:21:42,432 --> 00:21:44,791
I were bang out of order.

380
00:21:44,792 --> 00:21:46,071
It shouldn't have happened.

381
00:21:46,072 --> 00:21:49,311
You're right. I hold my hands up.
I'm sorry.

382
00:21:49,312 --> 00:21:53,311
OK.

383
00:21:53,432 --> 00:21:55,751
Look, it was lovely meeting you
and everything,

384
00:21:55,752 --> 00:21:57,191
but you really should leave.

385
00:21:57,192 --> 00:21:58,951
Look, whoa, whoa!

386
00:21:58,952 --> 00:22:01,031
I get it.

387
00:22:01,032 --> 00:22:03,071
I get it.

388
00:22:03,072 --> 00:22:04,711
Right? I was a prick.

389
00:22:04,712 --> 00:22:06,991
Can we just forget about it?

390
00:22:06,992 --> 00:22:10,911
I can't forget about it!
I can't forget about you.

391
00:22:10,912 --> 00:22:12,671
I want you to be my girlfriend,
Amy Goodwin.

392
00:22:12,672 --> 00:22:15,271
Can you please just fuck off

393
00:22:15,272 --> 00:22:17,271
or I'm gonna have to call
the police, all right?

394
00:22:17,272 --> 00:22:18,551
But, Amy...

395
00:22:18,552 --> 00:22:22,551
Amy Goodwin...

396
00:22:22,672 --> 00:22:25,671
I should do another one.

397
00:22:25,672 --> 00:22:28,871
Don't waste your money.
They'll all come out the same.

398
00:22:28,872 --> 00:22:30,431
It can't be right.

399
00:22:30,432 --> 00:22:34,431
Curtis, you're pregnant.

400
00:22:37,272 --> 00:22:38,431
You can't tell anyone, yeah?

401
00:22:38,432 --> 00:22:42,431
Don't worry, I won't.

402
00:22:43,272 --> 00:22:45,191
Who's the father?

403
00:22:45,192 --> 00:22:46,951
I don't know.

404
00:22:46,952 --> 00:22:49,831
Well, who did you have sex with
when you were a girl?

405
00:22:49,832 --> 00:22:50,431
No-one!

406
00:22:50,432 --> 00:22:51,911
It can't be no-one's.

407
00:22:51,912 --> 00:22:54,191
What about that stuff
with the creepy coach guy?

408
00:22:54,192 --> 00:22:57,671
Not him. He didn't do anything.

409
00:22:57,672 --> 00:23:01,671
Well, who then?

410
00:23:06,472 --> 00:23:10,471
Didn't... Rudy try it on with you?

411
00:23:15,552 --> 00:23:19,551
Motherfucker...!

412
00:23:19,712 --> 00:23:22,191
You should've seen her face. She
knows, she knows what she did to me.

413
00:23:22,192 --> 00:23:23,551
We need to think of something.

414
00:23:23,552 --> 00:23:27,191
Mate, you need to think of something,
cos you're the ideas man.

415
00:23:27,192 --> 00:23:31,191
I'm wasting away down here.

416
00:23:32,392 --> 00:23:36,151
How much money have you got?

417
00:23:36,152 --> 00:23:38,511
You're going to pay her
to have sex with you?!

418
00:23:38,512 --> 00:23:41,031
Well, let's have a better idea. Eh?

419
00:23:41,752 --> 00:23:45,311
Hang on.

420
00:23:45,312 --> 00:23:46,471
Yeah?

421
00:23:46,472 --> 00:23:47,351
Did you have sex with me?

422
00:23:47,352 --> 00:23:48,231
What?!

423
00:23:48,232 --> 00:23:50,351
Did you have sex with the girl me
that time in the locker room?

424
00:23:50,539 --> 00:23:51,804
'No, no, dude, I only went down
on you.'

425
00:23:51,852 --> 00:23:52,791
Well, then,
how come I'm pregnant?!

426
00:23:52,792 --> 00:23:55,551
Seriously? Mate, congratulations!

427
00:23:55,552 --> 00:23:58,231
Simon, our Curtis is pregnant.

428
00:23:58,232 --> 00:23:59,591
Yeah, mate, he's speechless.

429
00:23:59,592 --> 00:24:01,511
Listen, we're both really happy
for you.

430
00:24:01,512 --> 00:24:03,031
You're saying that nothing happened?

431
00:24:03,032 --> 00:24:04,551
'Dude, nowt happened.

432
00:24:04,552 --> 00:24:05,871
'Mate, I've got to go,

433
00:24:05,872 --> 00:24:07,831
'I've got more important things
to deal with right now,

434
00:24:07,832 --> 00:24:09,631
'like me cock, which is falling off!

435
00:24:09,632 --> 00:24:11,671
'Do one.'

436
00:24:11,672 --> 00:24:12,911
What did he say?

437
00:24:12,912 --> 00:24:15,311
He's saying his cock's falling off.

438
00:24:15,312 --> 00:24:19,311
What about the baby?

439
00:24:19,672 --> 00:24:20,871
Said it wasn't him.

440
00:24:20,872 --> 00:24:23,151
Well, it must be someone. These
things don't just happen on their
own!

441
00:24:23,152 --> 00:24:27,151
Yeah, I do know that!

442
00:24:42,712 --> 00:24:43,999
Oh, shit!

443
00:24:52,983 --> 00:24:53,742
Me again.

444
00:24:58,616 --> 00:24:59,675
What are you doing?

445
00:24:59,702 --> 00:25:01,461
I've got...

446
00:25:01,462 --> 00:25:03,221
?16.76.

447
00:25:03,289 --> 00:25:03,848
What for?

448
00:25:03,849 --> 00:25:05,288
Just forget everything,

449
00:25:05,289 --> 00:25:07,848
take the money, have sex with me.

450
00:25:07,849 --> 00:25:09,928
You think I'm a prostitute?!

451
00:25:09,929 --> 00:25:13,928
Or that you could be. If you wanted.

452
00:25:13,929 --> 00:25:16,248
Because you're so beautiful.

453
00:25:16,249 --> 00:25:17,208
Oh, my God.

454
00:25:17,209 --> 00:25:19,408
In the name of the Father,

455
00:25:19,409 --> 00:25:22,008
please, take the money and shag me!

456
00:25:22,009 --> 00:25:22,768
Look, I'll be really quick...

457
00:25:22,769 --> 00:25:24,128
Just get out.

458
00:25:24,129 --> 00:25:24,888
And I'll clean up after myself.

459
00:25:24,889 --> 00:25:27,648
Amy, are you all right?

460
00:25:27,649 --> 00:25:30,688
Will you go away? We're just
in the middle of something, sorry.

461
00:25:30,689 --> 00:25:34,328
It's nothing, it's... just some guy.

462
00:25:34,329 --> 00:25:38,328
Some... guy that you had sex with
last night.

463
00:25:38,329 --> 00:25:39,408
What?!

464
00:25:39,409 --> 00:25:40,288
What is he on about?

465
00:25:40,289 --> 00:25:43,768
I'm not ashamed of it, neither.
I'll scream it from the rooftops!

466
00:25:43,769 --> 00:25:47,648
I had sex with Amy Goodwin
last night, and she was amazing!

467
00:25:47,649 --> 00:25:48,728
You were amazing.

468
00:25:48,729 --> 00:25:51,288
We did not have sex.

469
00:25:51,289 --> 00:25:53,248
We just kissed, you twat!

470
00:25:53,249 --> 00:25:54,088
You kissed him?!

471
00:25:54,089 --> 00:25:56,448
OK, that does sound worse than it is.

472
00:25:56,449 --> 00:25:59,168
Whoa, sorry, we didn't have sex?

473
00:25:59,169 --> 00:26:00,088
So, what, you're back into guys now?

474
00:26:00,089 --> 00:26:01,368
I was drunk.

475
00:26:01,369 --> 00:26:03,848
Weird. I remember that
being the excuse last time.

476
00:26:03,849 --> 00:26:05,728
Can we talk about this later?

477
00:26:05,729 --> 00:26:07,848
Whoa, sorry to interrupt
this little...

478
00:26:07,849 --> 00:26:09,528
thing you've got going on here,

479
00:26:09,529 --> 00:26:12,368
but are you absolutely sure
we didn't have sex?

480
00:26:12,369 --> 00:26:14,608
Yes. So can you fuck off?

481
00:26:14,609 --> 00:26:17,408
Oh, ohhh, God!

482
00:26:17,409 --> 00:26:18,608
Ohh.

483
00:26:18,609 --> 00:26:22,608
Oh, er... Do apologise to your
sister for me, won't you? You know.

484
00:26:24,409 --> 00:26:28,008
Maybe come back and show her again
when it's better or summat.

485
00:26:28,009 --> 00:26:32,008
Nice one.

486
00:26:39,369 --> 00:26:40,968
It's not her, mate.

487
00:26:40,969 --> 00:26:43,088
It's got to be Collarbones...
she's the one.

488
00:26:43,089 --> 00:26:45,448
We should go back to the house
where the party was.

489
00:26:45,449 --> 00:26:46,768
Someone's got to know who she is.

490
00:26:46,769 --> 00:26:49,928
Come on, let's go.

491
00:26:49,929 --> 00:26:53,928
Oh, fuck!

492
00:27:15,489 --> 00:27:19,488
So... you're wanking off as a guy...

493
00:27:20,929 --> 00:27:24,928
and then swapping
and doing it again...

494
00:27:25,249 --> 00:27:27,848
as a girl?

495
00:27:27,849 --> 00:27:29,288
Uh-huh.

496
00:27:29,289 --> 00:27:32,688
Why?

497
00:27:32,689 --> 00:27:34,048
It passed the time.

498
00:27:34,049 --> 00:27:37,168
Ugh.

499
00:27:37,169 --> 00:27:41,168
I think I used the same...
the same tissue to...

500
00:27:42,649 --> 00:27:46,328
to wipe up.

501
00:27:46,329 --> 00:27:48,528
Both times.

502
00:27:48,529 --> 00:27:49,928
That is so fucking rank.

503
00:27:49,929 --> 00:27:53,928
Thanks for the sympathy, yeah?

504
00:27:53,969 --> 00:27:57,968
You got a sec?

505
00:28:06,009 --> 00:28:07,448
Are you pregnant?

506
00:28:07,449 --> 00:28:09,368
No.

507
00:28:09,369 --> 00:28:12,288
Well, there's this thing
in the toilet, a pee stick thing.

508
00:28:12,289 --> 00:28:15,368
I don't know
what you're talking about.

509
00:28:15,462 --> 00:28:18,181
Right. OK.

510
00:28:18,182 --> 00:28:22,181
It doesn't matter.

511
00:28:28,902 --> 00:28:31,221
This is really starting
to piss me off.

512
00:28:31,222 --> 00:28:35,221
Then just swap back,
just stop moaning about it.

513
00:28:45,102 --> 00:28:46,981
I can't switch back!

514
00:28:46,982 --> 00:28:50,981
You're kidding me.

515
00:28:57,102 --> 00:29:01,101
I'm stuck!

516
00:29:09,302 --> 00:29:13,301
Argh!

517
00:29:25,702 --> 00:29:27,741
Exposing yourself...

518
00:29:27,742 --> 00:29:30,461
to a 12-year-old girl.

519
00:29:30,462 --> 00:29:33,501
It were a simple misunderstanding.
Anyone could've done that.

520
00:29:33,502 --> 00:29:35,101
Your penis is going to fall off.

521
00:29:35,102 --> 00:29:37,021
What did I say to you?
I said, didn't I?

522
00:29:37,022 --> 00:29:38,901
If you go around,
acting like an idiot,

523
00:29:38,902 --> 00:29:41,661
sexing up all these girls,
you will catch something.

524
00:29:41,662 --> 00:29:45,381
I thought I might get the clap
or one or two crabs here and there.

525
00:29:45,382 --> 00:29:47,621
I weren't expecting this.
It's rotting away!

526
00:29:47,622 --> 00:29:49,701
Well, maybe if you treat her right

527
00:29:49,702 --> 00:29:52,141
instead of all the macho bollocks
all the time...

528
00:29:52,142 --> 00:29:52,821
Here we go.

529
00:29:52,822 --> 00:29:53,941
Just face it,

530
00:29:53,942 --> 00:29:57,821
the only reason, mate,
you treat girls like crap

531
00:29:57,822 --> 00:29:59,621
is because you're scared.

532
00:29:59,622 --> 00:30:03,621
You're scared if you let 'em in,
and they get to know the real you,

533
00:30:03,702 --> 00:30:05,541
you know,
then they might reject you.

534
00:30:05,542 --> 00:30:09,101
So you reject them,
before they get a chance.

535
00:30:09,102 --> 00:30:11,101
You never let your guard down.

536
00:30:11,102 --> 00:30:13,381
You are...

537
00:30:13,382 --> 00:30:15,301
pathetic.

538
00:30:15,302 --> 00:30:17,781
But now your todge
is going to fall off, so...

539
00:30:17,782 --> 00:30:21,781
Just shut the fuck up, man!

540
00:30:21,862 --> 00:30:25,461
Are you happy now?

541
00:30:25,462 --> 00:30:29,461
Yeah, I'm scared.

542
00:30:29,982 --> 00:30:33,981
I'm never going to have sex again
and I'm going to look like a freak.

543
00:30:35,662 --> 00:30:37,541
Well, I can't live with you
like this...

544
00:30:37,542 --> 00:30:41,541
you're going to do my head in.

545
00:30:43,142 --> 00:30:46,821
I might have an idea.

546
00:30:46,822 --> 00:30:50,741
I thought I'd cook you
some dinner tonight.

547
00:30:50,742 --> 00:30:52,341
Fishfingers, nothing special.

548
00:30:52,342 --> 00:30:54,421
Are you pregnant?

549
00:30:54,422 --> 00:30:55,501
What?

550
00:30:55,502 --> 00:30:56,901
It's OK.

551
00:30:56,902 --> 00:31:00,341
I know it's not what either of us
planned. I just want to say that...

552
00:31:00,342 --> 00:31:02,941
I'm there for you,
if you, you know...

553
00:31:02,942 --> 00:31:05,261
I'm not pregnant.

554
00:31:05,262 --> 00:31:06,461
I saw the pregnancy test thing
in the toilet.

555
00:31:06,462 --> 00:31:08,261
It's not mine.

556
00:31:08,262 --> 00:31:09,821
Well, Alisha says it's not hers,
so whose is it?

557
00:31:09,822 --> 00:31:11,341
I don't know!

558
00:31:11,342 --> 00:31:14,261
You can tell me.
Just... tell me the truth.

559
00:31:14,262 --> 00:31:15,501
I am!

560
00:31:15,502 --> 00:31:17,981
It's not mine.
I'm not pregnant, you dick.

561
00:31:17,982 --> 00:31:20,061
Right.

562
00:31:20,062 --> 00:31:22,021
So you can stop shitting yourself.

563
00:31:22,022 --> 00:31:24,221
What? It's fine, I wasn't worried.

564
00:31:24,222 --> 00:31:26,021
Nah, course you weren't!

565
00:31:26,022 --> 00:31:27,501
All right, maybe I was shitting
myself a little bit.

566
00:31:28,942 --> 00:31:31,981
Oh, it's work. I'd better get this.

567
00:31:31,982 --> 00:31:33,461
Yeah?

568
00:31:33,462 --> 00:31:36,861
Right.

569
00:31:36,862 --> 00:31:40,701
What, you found it?

570
00:31:40,702 --> 00:31:44,701
And where is it now?

571
00:31:45,382 --> 00:31:48,421
Yeah, yeah, I'm still here.

572
00:31:48,422 --> 00:31:50,781
Um... yeah, I want it.

573
00:31:50,782 --> 00:31:54,781
I'll be right there.

574
00:31:58,382 --> 00:31:59,701
Something's come up.

575
00:31:59,702 --> 00:32:01,101
I need to get going.

576
00:32:01,102 --> 00:32:04,461
It's fine, don't worry about it.

577
00:32:04,462 --> 00:32:08,461
I'm really sorry.

578
00:32:24,142 --> 00:32:25,421
Make it quick.

579
00:32:25,422 --> 00:32:29,421
Oh, I see... you're a watcher.
Well, unlucky, cos I need a shit.

580
00:32:42,142 --> 00:32:42,821
Oh!

581
00:32:42,822 --> 00:32:44,861
Are you all right?

582
00:32:44,862 --> 00:32:48,821
Just a bit of a messy one, mate.
You're better off out there.

583
00:32:50,142 --> 00:32:53,021
Swear you'll come back for me.

584
00:32:53,022 --> 00:32:55,781
Yep. Look, I promise.

585
00:32:55,782 --> 00:32:58,141
Thanks for doing this, man.

586
00:32:58,142 --> 00:33:02,061
Good luck, yeah?

587
00:33:02,062 --> 00:33:06,061
Hiya.

588
00:33:11,062 --> 00:33:14,421
I'm going to at least need some
antibacterial hand scrub

589
00:33:14,422 --> 00:33:18,421
or a hand towel. It's disgus...

590
00:33:38,102 --> 00:33:41,301
Just call me fucking Harry Houdini.

591
00:33:41,302 --> 00:33:43,101
I think I know where she might be.

592
00:33:43,102 --> 00:33:46,181
What?

593
00:33:46,182 --> 00:33:48,301
What's that?
Is that the best you've got?

594
00:33:48,302 --> 00:33:51,981
The future of my cock
depends on the slim chance

595
00:33:51,982 --> 00:33:55,141
that she's at some random nightclub?
Is that what you're saying?

596
00:33:55,142 --> 00:33:56,421
Yes.

597
00:33:56,422 --> 00:34:00,421
Well, let's get going, then!

598
00:34:06,542 --> 00:34:07,981
Shit.

599
00:34:07,982 --> 00:34:09,501
Yeah.

600
00:34:09,502 --> 00:34:11,301
I know.

601
00:34:11,302 --> 00:34:12,781
What are you going to do?

602
00:34:12,782 --> 00:34:14,101
I've tried everything.

603
00:34:14,102 --> 00:34:17,301
I'm stuck.

604
00:34:17,302 --> 00:34:19,181
So what happens to Curtis?

605
00:34:19,182 --> 00:34:22,541
I'm still here!

606
00:34:22,542 --> 00:34:25,701
So... what shall we call you?

607
00:34:25,702 --> 00:34:27,741
Like... Melissa or...?

608
00:34:27,742 --> 00:34:29,821
I don't give a shit!

609
00:34:29,822 --> 00:34:31,301
I'm going to have a baby.

610
00:34:31,302 --> 00:34:32,541
That isn't right.

611
00:34:32,542 --> 00:34:33,781
Kelly...

612
00:34:33,782 --> 00:34:34,861
I'm sorry.

613
00:34:34,862 --> 00:34:38,861
You can't have a baby where the mum's
a man who turns into a woman.

614
00:34:41,862 --> 00:34:45,861
There are options, you know.

615
00:34:47,822 --> 00:34:51,821
I'll see you tomorrow.

616
00:35:16,862 --> 00:35:20,861
It's in the boot.

617
00:35:22,622 --> 00:35:25,701
Are you going to ask me
where I found it?

618
00:35:25,702 --> 00:35:27,301
What?

619
00:35:27,302 --> 00:35:29,581
You know something,
after all this hassle,

620
00:35:29,582 --> 00:35:32,541
I thought you'd be
a little more excited.

621
00:35:32,542 --> 00:35:34,461
It's complicated.

622
00:35:34,462 --> 00:35:36,061
You do still want it, don't you?

623
00:35:36,062 --> 00:35:40,061
I mean, cos if you don't,
I can always find another buyer.

624
00:35:41,582 --> 00:35:42,861
Yeah.

625
00:35:42,862 --> 00:35:46,861
Yeah, I do want it.

626
00:36:16,422 --> 00:36:18,381
Don't worry,
I'm not going to hurt you.

627
00:36:18,382 --> 00:36:20,416
I've just come to take your power.

628
00:36:52,959 --> 00:36:54,078
Where is she, man?

629
00:36:54,079 --> 00:36:55,278
We should split up.

630
00:36:55,279 --> 00:36:56,758
Oh, that is a good idea!

631
00:36:56,759 --> 00:37:00,758
Listen, look for a girl with
beautiful collarbones, mate.

632
00:37:01,279 --> 00:37:05,278
All right? Good luck.

633
00:37:31,959 --> 00:37:33,518
Jesus Christ.

634
00:37:33,519 --> 00:37:35,558
Argh! Argh!

635
00:37:35,559 --> 00:37:37,158
Whoa. Oh, it's great to see you!

636
00:37:37,159 --> 00:37:38,878
You wanker!

637
00:37:38,879 --> 00:37:42,878
Listen, please, help me out.
Just shag me and make me better.

638
00:37:42,879 --> 00:37:44,878
What, you think that's
what this is about?

639
00:37:44,879 --> 00:37:46,238
I want another fuck,
and everything goes back to normal?

640
00:37:46,239 --> 00:37:48,598
I don't know what you want!

641
00:37:48,599 --> 00:37:51,038
I just didn't want to be treated
like shit!

642
00:37:51,039 --> 00:37:54,718
Guys like you, you shit on girls and
you just walk away, no harm done.

643
00:37:54,719 --> 00:37:56,518
You make me sick.

644
00:37:56,519 --> 00:38:00,518
Well, guess what?
Now your dick's going to fall off.

645
00:38:00,519 --> 00:38:02,038
And I'm glad.

646
00:38:02,039 --> 00:38:06,038
I'm hanging by a thread. I am
hanging by a thread! Help me out!

647
00:38:06,319 --> 00:38:07,638
Please help me.

648
00:38:07,639 --> 00:38:11,638
Fuck! Fuck's sake! My penis!

649
00:38:12,279 --> 00:38:16,278
Jesus Christ! Get out the way, move.

650
00:38:24,199 --> 00:38:25,758
Get off the stage, you wanker.

651
00:38:25,759 --> 00:38:29,238
Sorry to interrupt your party. Um...

652
00:38:29,239 --> 00:38:31,078
There's just something
I need to say.

653
00:38:31,079 --> 00:38:32,118
Fuck off!

654
00:38:32,119 --> 00:38:33,558
Hmm. I just want to say,

655
00:38:33,559 --> 00:38:35,998
to all the girls
I might have had sex with...

656
00:38:35,999 --> 00:38:38,558
and treated like shit,

657
00:38:38,559 --> 00:38:40,518
I am sorry.

658
00:38:40,519 --> 00:38:42,438
I'm sorry.

659
00:38:42,439 --> 00:38:45,678
I don't know why I do it.

660
00:38:45,679 --> 00:38:47,918
Maybe I am... scared.

661
00:38:47,919 --> 00:38:51,878
I just... I'm scared
that if you get to know me,

662
00:38:51,879 --> 00:38:55,878
when I'm not pissed and fucking
showing off, being a dick,

663
00:38:56,759 --> 00:38:59,358
you'll think I'm nothing...

664
00:38:59,359 --> 00:39:03,358
special.

665
00:39:04,679 --> 00:39:08,678
I'm just a twat with a big mouth.
Um...

666
00:39:08,959 --> 00:39:11,078
I never meant to hurt anyone.

667
00:39:11,079 --> 00:39:14,678
I'm sorry.

668
00:39:14,679 --> 00:39:15,958
Thanks, that's all I have to say.

669
00:39:15,959 --> 00:39:17,598
Fuck off, then!

670
00:39:17,599 --> 00:39:20,398
Shut up, you northern monkey!

671
00:39:45,959 --> 00:39:47,558
You looked like you meant that.

672
00:39:47,559 --> 00:39:49,518
I did. I did.

673
00:39:49,519 --> 00:39:51,278
You ever do this to anyone else...

674
00:39:51,279 --> 00:39:53,438
I swear! I swear to God,
I'll never do it again.

675
00:39:53,439 --> 00:39:57,438
Just make me better, please.

676
00:39:59,119 --> 00:40:02,678
Is that...? It's going back to
normal? It's going back to normal!

677
00:40:02,679 --> 00:40:04,558
Thank you so much!

678
00:40:04,559 --> 00:40:05,958
Anyway, nice knowing you.

679
00:40:05,959 --> 00:40:09,958
No, wait... I'm sorry, I didn't...

680
00:40:10,039 --> 00:40:12,078
I never got your name.

681
00:40:12,079 --> 00:40:14,878
I'm Rudy.

682
00:40:14,879 --> 00:40:18,718
Leah.

683
00:40:18,719 --> 00:40:22,718
You seem like a really nice girl.

684
00:40:23,199 --> 00:40:25,678
Do you want to...

685
00:40:25,679 --> 00:40:27,838
do you want to go for a drink?

686
00:40:27,839 --> 00:40:29,278
Oooh!

687
00:40:29,279 --> 00:40:33,278
So you want to get me drunk
and fuck me again, is that it?

688
00:40:33,439 --> 00:40:36,638
That's not what it is.

689
00:40:36,639 --> 00:40:39,158
It's not.

690
00:40:39,159 --> 00:40:43,158
See you later.

691
00:41:08,759 --> 00:41:11,598
'This is Seth, leave a message.'

692
00:41:11,599 --> 00:41:14,678
It's me.
I just wanted to say about Morocco.

693
00:41:14,679 --> 00:41:18,678
I don't know why I didn't say yeah
straightaway. I'm a dick.

694
00:41:19,039 --> 00:41:23,038
It's just that no-one's ever asked me
to go on holiday with them before.

695
00:41:23,199 --> 00:41:27,198
Anyway, yeah,
so just give me a call later.

696
00:41:28,279 --> 00:41:32,278
I miss ya.

697
00:41:55,719 --> 00:41:57,398
Where's Curtis?

698
00:41:57,399 --> 00:41:58,918
I don't know.

699
00:41:58,919 --> 00:42:00,878
I think he's got morning sickness.

700
00:42:00,879 --> 00:42:03,278
He should eat ginger biscuits.

701
00:42:03,279 --> 00:42:07,278
Apparently it helps
alleviate the nausea.

702
00:42:07,399 --> 00:42:11,398
Check this out!
Here you are, check it out.

703
00:42:12,359 --> 00:42:14,518
Check that bastard out,
it's immaculate!

704
00:42:14,519 --> 00:42:15,878
I'm very happy for you.

705
00:42:15,879 --> 00:42:16,998
Thank you.

706
00:42:16,999 --> 00:42:19,358
And, you know, thank you.

707
00:42:19,359 --> 00:42:22,438
Your boyfriend helped save my cock,
did you know that?

708
00:42:22,439 --> 00:42:23,718
I'm so proud!

709
00:42:23,719 --> 00:42:25,398
Yeah, and so you bloody should be.

710
00:42:25,399 --> 00:42:27,478
Do you know what, man?
It made me wonder.

711
00:42:27,479 --> 00:42:29,318
Cos you can't live life
for yourself.

712
00:42:29,319 --> 00:42:31,278
You've got to think about
other people.

713
00:42:31,279 --> 00:42:33,078
Like that song, you know...

714
00:42:33,079 --> 00:42:35,438
High School Musical,

715
00:42:35,439 --> 00:42:36,758
We're All In This Together?

716
00:42:36,759 --> 00:42:40,758
I never understood that song,
until now, mate. And...

717
00:42:41,719 --> 00:42:43,238
Oh, mate!

718
00:42:43,239 --> 00:42:44,358
I'm sorry.

719
00:42:44,359 --> 00:42:46,758
I completely forgot, mate.

720
00:42:46,759 --> 00:42:49,318
I'm... I'm sorry!

721
00:42:49,319 --> 00:42:50,678
Don't be like that!

722
00:42:50,679 --> 00:42:53,838
Don't, mate. I would've
remembered you eventually!

723
00:42:53,839 --> 00:42:55,038
Don't... Fuck!

724
00:42:55,039 --> 00:42:56,798
Dude! Come here, mate.

725
00:42:56,799 --> 00:43:00,798
Sorry. I'm sorry!

726
00:43:06,359 --> 00:43:09,198
And how can I help you today?

727
00:43:09,199 --> 00:43:12,958
It's me, Curtis.

728
00:43:12,959 --> 00:43:14,798
Right.

729
00:43:14,799 --> 00:43:17,158
Suits you.

730
00:43:17,159 --> 00:43:18,638
I'm stuck.

731
00:43:18,639 --> 00:43:19,998
I can't switch back.

732
00:43:19,999 --> 00:43:23,998
I need you to take my power.

733
00:43:25,959 --> 00:43:28,518
I can help you.

734
00:43:28,519 --> 00:43:29,998
But I need you to do
something for me.

735
00:43:29,999 --> 00:43:31,038
Whatever.

736
00:43:31,039 --> 00:43:32,158
I'll do it.

737
00:43:32,159 --> 00:43:33,918
I've got another power.

738
00:43:33,919 --> 00:43:37,478
I need to put it in you,
and you'll have to use it for me.

739
00:43:37,479 --> 00:43:40,238
What power?

740
00:43:40,239 --> 00:43:43,838
The power to bring people
back from the dead.

741
00:43:43,839 --> 00:43:44,918
Like who?

742
00:43:44,919 --> 00:43:47,958
A girl.

743
00:43:47,959 --> 00:43:51,958
I'm going to need more than that.

744
00:43:53,119 --> 00:43:55,718
My dead girlfriend.

745
00:43:55,719 --> 00:43:58,398
Ah, nah. Kelly's a mate.
I can't do that to her.

746
00:43:58,399 --> 00:44:00,918
It isn't like that.

747
00:44:00,919 --> 00:44:04,838
I need to do this.

748
00:44:04,839 --> 00:44:08,838
We can help each other out.

749
00:44:17,079 --> 00:44:21,078
OK.

750
00:44:55,359 --> 00:44:58,398
Let's go resurrect
my dead girlfriend.

751
00:44:58,399 --> 00:45:00,278
What the fuck is going on?

752
00:45:00,279 --> 00:45:01,518
Why are you dumping me?

753
00:45:01,519 --> 00:45:02,558
Shannon's alive.

754
00:45:02,559 --> 00:45:05,718
Cheerleaders! Sweet!

755
00:45:05,719 --> 00:45:07,558
He's dead.

756
00:45:07,559 --> 00:45:10,278
Mr Miggles got hit by a car.
I brought him back to life.

757
00:45:10,279 --> 00:45:11,358
Miggles!

758
00:45:11,359 --> 00:45:12,518
He attacked me.

759
00:45:12,519 --> 00:45:15,478
They think you're a zombie.
They're coming to kill you.

760
00:45:15,479 --> 00:45:19,478
We smash their skulls to destroy
their brains. We kill them all.

761
00:45:21,119 --> 00:45:23,958
We're really not bad kids.

762
00:45:23,959 --> 00:45:24,975
Yeah.

763
00:45:25,483 --> 00:45:30,783
