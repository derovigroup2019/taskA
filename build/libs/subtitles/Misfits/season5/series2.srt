1
00:00:00,078 --> 00:00:03,338
In the storm, I lost my memory.
Forgot everything.

2
00:00:03,351 --> 00:00:04,731
What's this? What am I looking at?

3
00:00:04,744 --> 00:00:07,264
It's a support group.
It's for people with powers.

4
00:00:07,504 --> 00:00:08,823
I think we should go.

5
00:00:08,824 --> 00:00:11,324
Did you get community service
for fucking him up the arse

6
00:00:11,342 --> 00:00:13,282
or breaking into
the Community Centre?

7
00:00:13,291 --> 00:00:16,570
Breaking and entering.

8
00:00:16,571 --> 00:00:20,571
I knit the future. Thanks.

9
00:00:21,451 --> 00:00:25,451
Are we gonna become
proper superheroes?

10
00:00:47,131 --> 00:00:48,591
So, what did she look like?

11
00:00:48,608 --> 00:00:50,808
Right, well, try to imagine,

12
00:00:50,904 --> 00:00:54,904
if an orang-utan and a bulldog,
they spawned a child, yeah?

13
00:00:55,304 --> 00:00:58,623
Now try and imagine,
that bloody child grows up

14
00:00:58,624 --> 00:01:00,023
and impregnates a pig. Eurgh.

15
00:01:00,024 --> 00:01:03,943
This pig-dog-monkey hybrid thing
would be a thing of beauty in comparison.

16
00:01:03,944 --> 00:01:06,903
Dude, honestly, this girl, man,
she was so physically ugly,

17
00:01:06,904 --> 00:01:09,343
it pained me
when I came on her face.

18
00:01:09,344 --> 00:01:12,103
Brilliant.
Seriously, she were minging, dude.

19
00:01:12,104 --> 00:01:15,383
If she was so hideously ugly,
why did you have sex with her?

20
00:01:15,384 --> 00:01:17,503
Really? Do you know,
this... this is just...

21
00:01:17,504 --> 00:01:20,143
this is the problem, isn't it, when
you're having sex with ugly birds?

22
00:01:20,144 --> 00:01:22,583
You're damned if you do, and you're
damned if you don't. I suppose

23
00:01:22,584 --> 00:01:24,943
you only have sex with people
you find physically attractive?

24
00:01:24,944 --> 00:01:26,383
It's a weird rule that I have.

25
00:01:26,384 --> 00:01:30,384
Well, that's a bit shallow, isn't
it? That's very shallow, Jess.

26
00:01:31,144 --> 00:01:33,784
What about you, Ab?
Have you ever done an ugly?

27
00:01:33,882 --> 00:01:36,122
Does he count?
No, I don't count!

28
00:01:36,164 --> 00:01:39,384
Trust me. You count.
Twice. Double points.

29
00:01:39,449 --> 00:01:41,969
Why am I double points?
Cos you're short.

30
00:01:42,495 --> 00:01:45,015
Oh, shit! No, no, no, no, no way!

31
00:01:45,047 --> 00:01:46,667
Has he seen me? Who?

32
00:01:46,744 --> 00:01:49,864
It's my dad. It's my frigging dad.
What's he doing here?

33
00:01:49,962 --> 00:01:51,561
Why are you hiding from your dad?

34
00:01:51,562 --> 00:01:52,881
He thinks I'm at university,

35
00:01:52,882 --> 00:01:55,001
doing a bloody Master's degree
in computer science.

36
00:01:55,002 --> 00:01:57,641
Do you know I'm actually...
I'm President of the Student Union

37
00:01:57,642 --> 00:01:59,361
and I'm captain of the rowing team?

38
00:01:59,362 --> 00:02:02,081
And I actually nearly made it
to the Olympics Squad by that much.

39
00:02:02,082 --> 00:02:04,081
Dude, your mum and dad
are proper going for it.

40
00:02:04,082 --> 00:02:07,681
No, they're not. My mum's classy. She
wouldn't do shit like that. Not in public.

41
00:02:07,682 --> 00:02:11,601
Oh shit! That's not my... that's
not my mum! That's not my mum!

42
00:02:11,602 --> 00:02:13,601
Is he fingering her? No!

43
00:02:13,602 --> 00:02:16,481
It's either that or he's lost
something in her vagina.

44
00:02:16,482 --> 00:02:20,481
Finley! It's my mum
you're talking about!

45
00:02:20,482 --> 00:02:22,921
You just fucking hit me?
Yeah, well, I'm very upset, Finley.

46
00:02:22,922 --> 00:02:25,521
Shit! Oh, fuck! Is he...

47
00:02:25,522 --> 00:02:29,522
Did he see me then?
Is he looking now?

48
00:02:30,399 --> 00:02:31,960
I think I'm going to cry.

49
00:02:32,256 --> 00:03:12,292

<font color="#3399CC">http://UKsubtitles.ru.</font>

50
00:03:16,802 --> 00:03:20,601
We have to tell Mum. You know, she...
she needs to know what's going on.

51
00:03:20,602 --> 00:03:22,081
No, man!

52
00:03:22,082 --> 00:03:23,481
But Dad is cheating on her, man!

53
00:03:23,482 --> 00:03:25,561
He's not, he's not cheating!

54
00:03:25,562 --> 00:03:27,001
He's...

55
00:03:27,002 --> 00:03:29,321
He is... he's fingering,
is what he's doing.

56
00:03:29,322 --> 00:03:32,321
It's not really cheating, man.
It's... it's more playful.

57
00:03:32,322 --> 00:03:35,041
Mum has a right to know
what's going on here.

58
00:03:35,042 --> 00:03:36,841
I won't do it! Stop saying.

59
00:03:36,842 --> 00:03:40,842
I won't do it. I won't do that to her.
I'm not going to break her frigging heart.

60
00:03:40,882 --> 00:03:43,001
Shit! I'm gonna have to
sort it, aren't I?

61
00:03:43,002 --> 00:03:44,441
What do you mean?

62
00:03:44,442 --> 00:03:47,561
I'm going to go round there, right,
and I'm going to say,

63
00:03:47,562 --> 00:03:51,201
"You frigging... you harlot!
You harlot. You're a home-wrecker!"

64
00:03:51,202 --> 00:03:54,521
You know, I just... I... I will not
come from a broken home!

65
00:03:54,522 --> 00:03:57,041
I won't be one of them kids
who's still pissing himself

66
00:03:57,042 --> 00:03:59,081
in his early-to-mid teens.

67
00:03:59,082 --> 00:04:02,521
You were one of them kids.

68
00:04:02,522 --> 00:04:05,321
I had a bladder infection.

69
00:04:05,322 --> 00:04:08,001
Right. I'll see you later.

70
00:04:08,002 --> 00:04:10,401
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Where you going?

71
00:04:10,402 --> 00:04:13,561
I...I have to...
I have to be somewhere, don't I?

72
00:04:13,562 --> 00:04:16,721
Where have you got to be?
You never have to be anywhere.

73
00:04:16,722 --> 00:04:20,722
What do you know about my life?

74
00:04:26,642 --> 00:04:28,241
What do you think?

75
00:04:28,242 --> 00:04:30,441
I'm going to put them up
around the estate.

76
00:04:30,442 --> 00:04:34,361
You're not really missing,
cos you're sat there.

77
00:04:34,362 --> 00:04:37,721
Maybe it should just say "found".

78
00:04:37,722 --> 00:04:41,722
Dog seeks owner. Not dog.
Girl. Girl seeks owner.

79
00:04:42,202 --> 00:04:46,041
Yeah, cos that wouldn't
attract any perverts.

80
00:04:46,042 --> 00:04:49,041
What about,
"Girl seeks self-identity"?

81
00:04:49,042 --> 00:04:51,281
We're not at art school.

82
00:04:51,282 --> 00:04:55,282
I'm going to think about this
while I change my tampon.

83
00:05:02,802 --> 00:05:04,681
Alex?

84
00:05:04,682 --> 00:05:08,682
Now you're part of the gang,
do we get free drinks?

85
00:05:09,202 --> 00:05:12,601
No.

86
00:05:12,602 --> 00:05:16,602
Well, what time does it start?

87
00:05:16,802 --> 00:05:20,601
No. I'm... yeah, I'm just leaving.

88
00:05:20,602 --> 00:05:23,121
I'll see you there?

89
00:05:23,122 --> 00:05:25,401
OK. OK.

90
00:05:25,402 --> 00:05:29,402
Bye.

91
00:06:04,882 --> 00:06:06,361
Jess! Aah!

92
00:06:06,362 --> 00:06:08,121
Jess!

93
00:06:08,122 --> 00:06:09,401
Stop!

94
00:06:09,402 --> 00:06:11,641
You gonna do that?

95
00:06:11,642 --> 00:06:15,321
Fuck's sake.

96
00:06:15,322 --> 00:06:17,681
Ah. Buzzing.
Listen, what are you doing...

97
00:06:17,682 --> 00:06:19,481
Ooh. What you doing right now?

98
00:06:19,482 --> 00:06:22,001
I'm going for a facial.
I'll give you a facial.

99
00:06:22,002 --> 00:06:23,921
Excuse me? Ha-ha-ha!

100
00:06:23,922 --> 00:06:27,922
Sorry. I disgust myself
when I'm nervous.

101
00:06:28,322 --> 00:06:30,561
Fuck, it's small in here.

102
00:06:30,562 --> 00:06:32,921
What I meant to say was,

103
00:06:32,922 --> 00:06:35,801
would you mind giving me a lift
to my dad's harlot's flat, please?

104
00:06:35,802 --> 00:06:37,041
Why can't Finn do it?

105
00:06:37,042 --> 00:06:41,042
Because Finn doesn't have any respect for the
institution of marriage, it would appear.

106
00:06:41,162 --> 00:06:42,761
And he doesn't have a car.

107
00:06:42,762 --> 00:06:46,762
So... wagons roll!

108
00:06:56,602 --> 00:07:00,602
Right.

109
00:07:02,282 --> 00:07:04,041
How's that?

110
00:07:04,042 --> 00:07:05,641
You're not going on a date with her.

111
00:07:05,642 --> 00:07:07,721
Well, actually, yes,
she is going on a date.

112
00:07:07,722 --> 00:07:11,121
She's going on a date with destiny.
No-one fucks with my family.

113
00:07:11,122 --> 00:07:15,122
No-one fucks members of my family.
Apart other members of my family.

114
00:07:15,922 --> 00:07:16,961
Your dad's here.

115
00:07:16,962 --> 00:07:19,561
Shit! Right, start the engine!
This was a terrible idea!

116
00:07:19,562 --> 00:07:22,081
You never should have made me
come here. You're a fool!

117
00:07:22,082 --> 00:07:23,561
This is a perfect opportunity

118
00:07:23,562 --> 00:07:26,521
for you to talk to both of them
without your mum being around.

119
00:07:26,522 --> 00:07:30,522
You should confront him.

120
00:07:32,082 --> 00:07:34,761
Will you come with me, please?
No.

121
00:07:34,762 --> 00:07:38,121
Oh, well, what a selfish cunt.

122
00:07:38,122 --> 00:07:40,921
Really? No.

123
00:07:40,922 --> 00:07:43,961
Not at all. I can't do this.
I can't do it on my own.

124
00:07:43,962 --> 00:07:46,201
I'm not... I'm not mature enough.

125
00:07:46,202 --> 00:07:48,921
You know what?
I might have a big lush pubic bush,

126
00:07:48,922 --> 00:07:51,721
but that does not maketh me a man.

127
00:07:51,722 --> 00:07:55,601
I'm a child. I'm masquerading
in a man's body back here.

128
00:07:55,602 --> 00:07:58,761
All right. Just stop talking
about your lush pubic bush.

129
00:07:58,762 --> 00:08:01,521
I'll come with you.

130
00:08:01,522 --> 00:08:05,522
I use a volumising conditioner,
in case you're wondering.

131
00:08:08,322 --> 00:08:11,081
No, no! What are you doing?
DOORBELL RINGS

132
00:08:11,082 --> 00:08:13,481
I'm mentally preparing myself,
you fool. What...

133
00:08:13,482 --> 00:08:16,441
What?

134
00:08:16,442 --> 00:08:19,841
Bonjour.

135
00:08:19,842 --> 00:08:23,842
I am French, and I am selling...

136
00:08:24,002 --> 00:08:25,601
la cheese.

137
00:08:25,602 --> 00:08:27,001
You're selling cheese?

138
00:08:27,002 --> 00:08:31,002
No, it is, um... how would you say?

139
00:08:31,962 --> 00:08:34,241
La fromage

140
00:08:34,242 --> 00:08:38,242
avec la milk...

141
00:08:39,402 --> 00:08:41,241
..of la monkey francais.

142
00:08:41,242 --> 00:08:44,001
Fuck off.

143
00:08:44,002 --> 00:08:45,361
Shit.

144
00:08:45,362 --> 00:08:46,801
You're selling...

145
00:08:46,802 --> 00:08:48,881
monkey cheese?

146
00:08:48,882 --> 00:08:50,561
So, no, no, no.
I fucking panicked, didn't I?

147
00:08:50,562 --> 00:08:52,601
It was the first thing
that sprung to mind. Shit!

148
00:08:52,602 --> 00:08:55,721
Monkey cheese?
Well, you think of summat, then!

149
00:08:55,722 --> 00:08:58,121
Double glazing.
Oh, well, really?

150
00:08:58,122 --> 00:08:59,681
Really? That's original, isn't it?

151
00:08:59,682 --> 00:09:02,361
She already has it. She has
double glazing. So, that's no sale.

152
00:09:02,362 --> 00:09:05,481
D'you want to try again? No,
I don't. Don't. Try again? Christ.

153
00:09:05,482 --> 00:09:08,041
I can't tell her I'm not
a French monkey-cheese salesman.

154
00:09:08,042 --> 00:09:10,001
I'm gonna look
fucking ridiculous, aren't I?

155
00:09:10,002 --> 00:09:11,921
Right, and we wouldn't
want that, would we?

156
00:09:11,922 --> 00:09:13,481
I'm not that guy, am I?

157
00:09:13,482 --> 00:09:15,521
What guy?
A French monkey-cheese salesman?

158
00:09:15,522 --> 00:09:17,721
No, not a frigging
French monkey-cheese...

159
00:09:17,722 --> 00:09:20,161
The guy who does good
noble shit and saves his...

160
00:09:20,162 --> 00:09:22,401
saves his parents' marriage.

161
00:09:22,402 --> 00:09:25,521
Well, you... you might be that guy.

162
00:09:25,522 --> 00:09:28,121
Maybe you just need
a bit of practice.

163
00:09:28,122 --> 00:09:31,801
Don't you walk away from me!
You don't ever do that!

164
00:09:31,802 --> 00:09:33,362
I can't do this any more!

165
00:09:40,362 --> 00:09:44,362
I told you. I told you what I'd do
if you ever tried to leave me.

166
00:09:44,642 --> 00:09:47,121
Geoff, please, don't.

167
00:09:47,122 --> 00:09:49,561
I will find you and I will hurt you.

168
00:09:49,562 --> 00:09:51,241
Please.

169
00:09:51,242 --> 00:09:54,521
Why do you do this?
You make me like this.

170
00:09:54,522 --> 00:09:56,601
You're playing games with me.

171
00:09:56,602 --> 00:10:00,561
You think you can play games?

172
00:10:00,562 --> 00:10:03,961
Try it.

173
00:10:03,962 --> 00:10:06,121
Clean yourself up.

174
00:10:06,122 --> 00:10:10,122
You're fucking disgusting.

175
00:10:21,802 --> 00:10:25,802
Are you all right?

176
00:10:26,482 --> 00:10:28,401
I always wanted to be him.

177
00:10:28,402 --> 00:10:32,081
You know.

178
00:10:32,082 --> 00:10:36,082
Be like him.

179
00:10:37,682 --> 00:10:41,241
I...I thought that my dad was
the greatest man on earth,

180
00:10:41,242 --> 00:10:45,121
him and Roy Castle.

181
00:10:45,122 --> 00:10:49,122
But my dad was always edging it.

182
00:10:52,842 --> 00:10:56,842
Now I don't know him.

183
00:11:05,562 --> 00:11:07,109
Will you take me home, please?

184
00:11:20,490 --> 00:11:24,570
So, there's this stuff going on
with our parents and...

185
00:11:25,093 --> 00:11:29,093
he won't let me in,
he won't listen to me.

186
00:11:29,979 --> 00:11:33,979
It's like I don't even exist.

187
00:11:34,839 --> 00:11:38,839
Something happened to us.
Something happened to all of us.

188
00:11:39,559 --> 00:11:42,118
We didn't ask for it.

189
00:11:42,119 --> 00:11:46,119
We didn't ask for it so why should
we be ashamed of who we are?

190
00:11:49,399 --> 00:11:53,399
Why should we have to hide away?

191
00:11:55,199 --> 00:11:59,199
It's not fair.

192
00:12:00,519 --> 00:12:04,519
It's not fair.

193
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:12,598
Has either of you seen Rudy?
He is on the roof.

194
00:12:12,599 --> 00:12:14,518
Staring at the distance.

195
00:12:14,519 --> 00:12:16,838
Has this look on his face like...

196
00:12:16,839 --> 00:12:18,078
Did you talk to him?

197
00:12:18,079 --> 00:12:22,079
No, I just crept away
before he could see me.

198
00:12:50,279 --> 00:12:53,718
Are you all right?

199
00:12:53,719 --> 00:12:57,719
No, I'm not. I'm very fucking far
from being all right.

200
00:12:59,319 --> 00:13:02,958
What are you going to do?

201
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:05,398
I'm going to go round
my parents' house,

202
00:13:05,399 --> 00:13:07,798
and as soon as my dad
answers the door,

203
00:13:07,799 --> 00:13:10,078
I'm going to punch him
in his shitty little face.

204
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:12,358
That's what I'm going to do.

205
00:13:12,359 --> 00:13:16,359
Fuck!

206
00:13:24,839 --> 00:13:27,358
Fuck you! Oh! Mum.
Aaah! Oh!

207
00:13:27,359 --> 00:13:29,278
What the hell are you doing?
Oh.

208
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:33,279
Classic.

209
00:13:33,319 --> 00:13:35,438
Your face then. Ah.

210
00:13:35,439 --> 00:13:37,238
You scared the shit out of me.

211
00:13:37,239 --> 00:13:38,958
Hilarious.

212
00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:41,838
I thought you'd gone mental again.
What do you mean, mental again?

213
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:43,518
Mental again? What do you mean,
again?

214
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:46,358
I thought you were at work.
Yeah, I've got the day off.

215
00:13:46,359 --> 00:13:48,158
Fancied doing the garden.
Here he is.

216
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:49,238
All right, son?

217
00:13:49,239 --> 00:13:50,918
All right, Dad?
How's the rowing?

218
00:13:50,919 --> 00:13:54,398
I thought you were in Spain,
at that training camp?

219
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:58,399
Yes, I was in Spain at the training
camp. Do you know what, though?

220
00:13:58,719 --> 00:14:01,838
They said there was nothing more
they could teach me so I just rowed home.

221
00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:03,198
Oh, right.
From Spain?

222
00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:05,558
No, bloody hell,
don't be ridiculous.

223
00:14:05,559 --> 00:14:09,118
Like, I dunno, two thirds
of the way.

224
00:14:09,119 --> 00:14:12,998
Do you want to stay for tea, son?
I'm not hungry.

225
00:14:12,999 --> 00:14:16,158
So, how are you, Dad?
Oh, you know, keeping busy.

226
00:14:16,159 --> 00:14:18,718
Oh, busy? Been busy?

227
00:14:18,719 --> 00:14:22,038
Busy doing what, exactly? What
exactly are you busy doing, Dad?

228
00:14:22,039 --> 00:14:24,238
Are you all right?

229
00:14:24,239 --> 00:14:27,598
Dad, I'm all right.
I'm all right. Yeah, I'm all right.

230
00:14:27,599 --> 00:14:29,878
The question is, really, are you?

231
00:14:29,879 --> 00:14:32,598
Are you all right, Dad?
Yeah.

232
00:14:32,599 --> 00:14:35,878
Are you?
I'm fine, aye.

233
00:14:35,879 --> 00:14:37,238
Rudy, what is it?

234
00:14:37,239 --> 00:14:41,239
There's something I have to tell
you, Mum, and it's killing me, all right?

235
00:14:42,119 --> 00:14:44,798
What is it, son?
I'm sorry. Oh, fuck off!

236
00:14:44,799 --> 00:14:47,278
You know!
Don't make me say it, when you know!

237
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:49,998
You're gay, aren't you?

238
00:14:49,999 --> 00:14:51,958
Oh, my God.

239
00:14:51,959 --> 00:14:53,998
It's OK. We've always suspected it.

240
00:14:53,999 --> 00:14:55,878
Well, I'm not gay, so...

241
00:14:55,879 --> 00:14:58,438
Well, there was all that trouble
with the Boy Scouts.

242
00:14:58,439 --> 00:15:01,158
Fucking hell! That was
an experimental stage, weren't it?

243
00:15:01,159 --> 00:15:05,159
No-one judged Isaac Newton when he
were friggin' wanking on apples, did they?

244
00:15:05,679 --> 00:15:08,198
Yeah, well, apples aren't the same
as 12-year-old boys.

245
00:15:08,199 --> 00:15:09,478
Yeah, maybe not to you, Mum.

246
00:15:09,479 --> 00:15:13,479
And maybe that's why you never discovered
the fucking... the laws of gravity.

247
00:15:13,559 --> 00:15:17,318
Well, you know, you never had
a girlfriend so we assumed...

248
00:15:17,319 --> 00:15:18,598
That I was a big gay.

249
00:15:18,599 --> 00:15:21,598
Well, I'm sorry to disappoint you
but I've had loads of birds.

250
00:15:21,599 --> 00:15:23,518
I'm disgusting, I'll do anything.

251
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:26,038
I've... I've got a reputation
as a total slag.

252
00:15:26,039 --> 00:15:28,518
Mum, I am quite the slut.

253
00:15:28,519 --> 00:15:30,598
How come we've not met any of them,
then?

254
00:15:30,599 --> 00:15:34,278
Because, I am, erm... Fuck it.
I'm embarrassed of you both!

255
00:15:34,279 --> 00:15:38,279
Look at you both. Look at you right
now. You are an embarrassment.

256
00:15:38,359 --> 00:15:40,918
I'm ashamed.
Deep shame for the pair of you.

257
00:15:40,919 --> 00:15:43,758
Oh, thanks for those kind words.

258
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:46,358
Fuck.
It's OK.

259
00:15:46,359 --> 00:15:49,878
We love you just how you are.
Look at you.

260
00:15:49,879 --> 00:15:53,198
You're so handsome. Get your good
looks from his dad, doesn't he?

261
00:15:53,199 --> 00:15:57,199
Oh, you smooth talker, you.

262
00:15:58,439 --> 00:16:02,439
So, if, er... you're not gay, what
did you want to talk to us about, son?

263
00:16:04,719 --> 00:16:06,038
Erm...

264
00:16:06,039 --> 00:16:08,238
No.

265
00:16:08,239 --> 00:16:10,838
I just... I can't... I can't do it.

266
00:16:10,839 --> 00:16:14,839
We're going to have to go
for plan B.

267
00:16:35,039 --> 00:16:36,318
You all right?

268
00:16:36,319 --> 00:16:38,878
I'm fighting it.

269
00:16:38,879 --> 00:16:41,518
Every day's a battle.

270
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:45,278
I...I feel like I'm slipping back
into the game world.

271
00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:47,198
But I can't go back. I can't!
Hey.

272
00:16:47,199 --> 00:16:49,238
Man, it's all right.

273
00:16:49,239 --> 00:16:52,758
Can we meet up some time?

274
00:16:52,759 --> 00:16:55,398
I have to talk to someone, man.
I feel like I'm losing my mind.

275
00:16:55,399 --> 00:16:58,398
Of course.

276
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:01,358
Whenever you want.
I'm here for you, yeah?

277
00:17:01,359 --> 00:17:05,359
Thanks.
No worries.

278
00:17:13,479 --> 00:17:14,798
Go in there.

279
00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:17,638
You tell her you know exactly
what your dad's doing to her

280
00:17:17,639 --> 00:17:20,998
and you tell her to leave the
bastard.

281
00:17:20,999 --> 00:17:24,999
Yeah.

282
00:17:39,599 --> 00:17:43,599
I'm fucking getting sick
of all this. Cow!

283
00:17:44,719 --> 00:17:45,999
Shit.

284
00:17:52,439 --> 00:17:54,478
Fucking bitch!

285
00:17:54,479 --> 00:17:57,758
What's he doing?
Cow!

286
00:17:57,759 --> 00:17:59,518
He's burning her clothes.

287
00:17:59,519 --> 00:18:03,038
Why is he burning her clothes?
Fucking...

288
00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:06,479
Er...

289
00:18:14,159 --> 00:18:18,159
Oh, fuck.

290
00:18:19,399 --> 00:18:20,919
Fuck it.

291
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:48,438
I'm just going to say it.
Don't.

292
00:18:48,439 --> 00:18:50,798
That looked like blood on the carpet.

293
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:52,878
Fuck! Fuck! Oh!

294
00:18:52,879 --> 00:18:55,078
You broke my CD player!

295
00:18:55,079 --> 00:18:57,638
Well, who the frigging hell
plays CDs any more?

296
00:18:57,639 --> 00:19:00,318
It's ridiculous!

297
00:19:00,319 --> 00:19:02,838
Call your dad and ask him
if he wants to meet you for a beer.

298
00:19:02,839 --> 00:19:03,878
What do you mean?

299
00:19:03,879 --> 00:19:06,798
My dad's murdered his girlfriend.
You want me to take him for a beer?

300
00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:09,998
Why don't I just throw in some
ten-pin bowling and a fucking foot massage?

301
00:19:09,999 --> 00:19:13,038
While you're buying him the beer,
I will break into the flat

302
00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:17,039
and see if I can find out if your dad
has actually murdered her.

303
00:19:25,119 --> 00:19:28,038
Cheers, son.
Mm-hm.

304
00:19:28,039 --> 00:19:32,039
Yeah.

305
00:20:16,199 --> 00:20:20,158
One sec.

306
00:20:20,159 --> 00:20:21,198
Yes?

307
00:20:21,199 --> 00:20:23,718
He's here. Your dad's back.

308
00:20:23,719 --> 00:20:26,638
No, he's not. He, erm...

309
00:20:26,639 --> 00:20:29,278
The ostrich is in the coop.

310
00:20:29,279 --> 00:20:31,918
The fucking ostrich
is sat right in front of me.

311
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:34,358
He's drinking a bottle
of Continental lager.

312
00:20:34,359 --> 00:20:38,359
Then who's here in the flat?

313
00:20:38,959 --> 00:20:41,678
One sec.

314
00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:43,118
Just a hypothetical question.

315
00:20:43,119 --> 00:20:47,119
You... you don't... do you have a twin
brother you've never told me about?

316
00:20:53,759 --> 00:20:55,638
There was a storm.

317
00:20:55,639 --> 00:20:59,639
Shit.

318
00:21:04,359 --> 00:21:06,838
I know it's going to sound crazy
but I split into two.

319
00:21:06,839 --> 00:21:09,398
I guess he was the part of me
I wasn't proud of.

320
00:21:09,399 --> 00:21:13,399
I haven't always been a nice person.
I hid it from you.

321
00:21:13,999 --> 00:21:16,358
I was a shit. A nasty shit.

322
00:21:16,359 --> 00:21:19,518
That... that part of me is gone.

323
00:21:19,519 --> 00:21:23,518
It's all in him.

324
00:21:23,519 --> 00:21:27,519
Shit! Jess... Jess?

325
00:21:54,879 --> 00:21:56,158
Oh!

326
00:21:56,159 --> 00:21:57,828
Who the fuck are you?

327
00:22:02,843 --> 00:22:06,395
Jessica! I've come here...
I've come here to save you! I'm...

328
00:22:06,995 --> 00:22:10,995
Ow! Fucking hell!

329
00:22:11,370 --> 00:22:12,570
Hello, son.

330
00:22:13,425 --> 00:22:16,565
Has he touched you? If you so much
as fucking touched her, mate...

331
00:22:16,624 --> 00:22:18,468
Did he touch you?
Have you fucking touched her?

332
00:22:18,492 --> 00:22:20,721
Rudy? I'm fine.

333
00:22:20,745 --> 00:22:22,865
We were just having a friendly
chat.

334
00:22:22,941 --> 00:22:24,461
We weren't having a friendly
anything.

335
00:22:24,509 --> 00:22:26,929
He said he wouldn't let me go
until I tell him where Tina is.

336
00:22:26,974 --> 00:22:28,611
We thought you'd bloody murdered
her. Do you know that?

337
00:22:28,612 --> 00:22:30,532
She's gone. She's left me.

338
00:22:30,584 --> 00:22:31,983
Good! Good for her!

339
00:22:31,984 --> 00:22:34,143
Cos you know my dad, my real dad?

340
00:22:34,144 --> 00:22:37,583
Mate, he's told me everything. You
absolutely... you disgust me, mate.

341
00:22:37,584 --> 00:22:40,183
I'm your dad too. Well, part of him.

342
00:22:40,184 --> 00:22:42,983
Maybe we should go for a drink
some time, you know.

343
00:22:42,984 --> 00:22:44,903
Get to know each other properly.

344
00:22:44,904 --> 00:22:48,904
Yeah, lets go for a drink! You're
nothing to me, you moron. Nothing.

345
00:22:49,144 --> 00:22:52,183
Honestly, pal, you are...

346
00:22:52,184 --> 00:22:54,423
Come on, now. Were going. Lets go.

347
00:22:54,424 --> 00:22:57,743
Oh, get your fucking hand
off my shoulder now, pal.

348
00:22:57,744 --> 00:23:00,303
Come around, any time.
Get it off.

349
00:23:00,304 --> 00:23:03,303
Fucking get off. Cunt.

350
00:23:03,304 --> 00:23:07,304
Prick.

351
00:23:39,184 --> 00:23:40,263
Oh, Jesus!

352
00:23:40,264 --> 00:23:43,503
What the fuck are you doing?
You scared the shit out of me.

353
00:23:43,504 --> 00:23:45,383
What... What are you doing?

354
00:23:45,384 --> 00:23:48,983
Showering.

355
00:23:48,984 --> 00:23:52,984
I like to shower
before community service.

356
00:23:56,144 --> 00:23:58,143
Why don't you shower at home?

357
00:23:58,144 --> 00:24:00,303
Why don't I shower at home?

358
00:24:00,304 --> 00:24:04,223
It's a good question.

359
00:24:04,224 --> 00:24:06,943
Water's off.

360
00:24:06,944 --> 00:24:08,783
No water.

361
00:24:08,784 --> 00:24:12,143
It's dry... it's as dry
as a badger's...

362
00:24:12,144 --> 00:24:16,144
Dry.

363
00:24:19,504 --> 00:24:23,504
Can I have my towel?

364
00:24:46,024 --> 00:24:49,103
Will you stop sniffing that scarf?

365
00:24:49,104 --> 00:24:51,343
There's something about the smell of
her.

366
00:24:51,344 --> 00:24:53,743
I keep asking girls in the bar
if it's theirs,

367
00:24:53,744 --> 00:24:55,103
and none of them are her.

368
00:24:55,104 --> 00:24:57,183
She's like Cinderella.

369
00:24:57,184 --> 00:25:01,184
This Cinderella, did you shag her?

370
00:25:02,024 --> 00:25:03,503
What? No.

371
00:25:03,504 --> 00:25:07,504
Cinderella, like in the fairy tale.

372
00:25:09,504 --> 00:25:11,343
Pumpkin.

373
00:25:11,344 --> 00:25:15,344
Fairy godmother.

374
00:25:15,624 --> 00:25:19,624
She had a glass slipper.

375
00:25:22,744 --> 00:25:26,744
Fucking start, you piece of shit!

376
00:25:29,104 --> 00:25:30,943
No, wait, it's you!

377
00:25:30,944 --> 00:25:34,183
You're the monkey-cheese guy.

378
00:25:34,184 --> 00:25:36,743
Why are you looking at me like that?

379
00:25:36,744 --> 00:25:40,744
Because you know my dad, don't you?

380
00:25:41,104 --> 00:25:45,104
He split in two?
There's two of him?

381
00:25:45,784 --> 00:25:47,983
You got the shitty end of the stick,
mate.

382
00:25:47,984 --> 00:25:51,223
Well, the shitty end of the dad.

383
00:25:51,224 --> 00:25:55,224
Is there somewhere you can go,
away from here, away from him?

384
00:25:56,024 --> 00:25:58,463
Your dad. Geoff.

385
00:25:58,464 --> 00:26:01,583
He took all my money. Oh, no.

386
00:26:01,584 --> 00:26:04,903
He's got it all in his bank account.

387
00:26:04,904 --> 00:26:08,904
Everything's in his name.
I can't get to it.

388
00:26:10,024 --> 00:26:11,063
Your dad can.

389
00:26:11,064 --> 00:26:13,983
Mm? Your other dad.

390
00:26:13,984 --> 00:26:15,423
He can get the money.

391
00:26:15,424 --> 00:26:19,424
Whoa! Yes, yes, yes!
No, my... my other dad!

392
00:26:21,384 --> 00:26:24,583
He can... he can get her money back,
cant he?

393
00:26:24,584 --> 00:26:28,584
That's what it is.

394
00:26:29,184 --> 00:26:31,423
Shit, man, I'm not sure how, like.

395
00:26:31,424 --> 00:26:35,424
Is it cos...

396
00:26:35,504 --> 00:26:37,783
Its your idea, innit?

397
00:26:37,784 --> 00:26:39,943
Its her idea.

398
00:26:39,944 --> 00:26:41,223
We'll get it.

399
00:26:41,224 --> 00:26:42,863
Monkey cheese? Is that even a thing?

400
00:26:42,864 --> 00:26:44,623
Monkeys give milk to their young.

401
00:26:44,624 --> 00:26:46,583
So I guess you could make
cheese out of it.

402
00:26:46,584 --> 00:26:48,823
Hold him, man!

403
00:26:48,824 --> 00:26:51,783
Turn him round, man!

404
00:26:51,784 --> 00:26:53,303
See, I wish Jess was here,

405
00:26:53,304 --> 00:26:55,223
cos girls can intervene
in this kind of thing

406
00:26:55,224 --> 00:26:56,943
without getting their heads kicked
in.

407
00:26:56,944 --> 00:26:59,303
Hey!

408
00:26:59,304 --> 00:27:02,023
Why don't you just leave him
the fuck alone, yeah?

409
00:27:02,024 --> 00:27:04,063
Are you talking to us?

410
00:27:04,064 --> 00:27:06,623
Yeah, I'm talking to you. Do you
really think you're a big man

411
00:27:06,624 --> 00:27:08,463
cos there's three of you taking on
one kid?

412
00:27:08,464 --> 00:27:10,743
Come on, come on.

413
00:27:10,744 --> 00:27:14,744
He's joking, he's joking.
Hey, just live... live and let live.

414
00:27:15,544 --> 00:27:16,863
I'm gonna shank you!

415
00:27:16,864 --> 00:27:19,143
Me? Why me? Shank him!

416
00:27:19,144 --> 00:27:21,823
Finn!

417
00:27:21,824 --> 00:27:25,303
Take one more step.

418
00:27:25,304 --> 00:27:26,823
Do... Whoa!

419
00:27:26,824 --> 00:27:28,943
What you gonna do, little man?

420
00:27:28,944 --> 00:27:32,943
You want to see what I can do?

421
00:27:32,944 --> 00:27:34,783
Show me.

422
00:27:34,784 --> 00:27:36,623
You will shit in your pants.

423
00:27:36,624 --> 00:27:40,624
You got jokes, innit?

424
00:27:54,704 --> 00:27:58,704
What the fuck?

425
00:28:00,024 --> 00:28:01,663
I'll see you around, innit?

426
00:28:01,664 --> 00:28:05,664
Yeah. Whatever, mate.

427
00:28:11,144 --> 00:28:15,144
Sucker!

428
00:28:18,464 --> 00:28:22,464
Where's the kid?

429
00:28:23,664 --> 00:28:26,103
See, this is why you
shouldn't help people out.

430
00:28:26,104 --> 00:28:27,143
Not so much as a...

431
00:28:27,144 --> 00:28:29,503
a "Thanks, here's a 20,
have a few drinks on me."

432
00:28:29,504 --> 00:28:31,423
Just...

433
00:28:31,424 --> 00:28:35,424
ungrateful little shit.

434
00:28:36,184 --> 00:28:40,184
Stepping up like that, though,
that... that was kind of superhero.

435
00:28:59,664 --> 00:29:01,303
Hi. Hello, Dad.

436
00:29:01,304 --> 00:29:03,263
Rudy told me everything.

437
00:29:03,264 --> 00:29:07,264
I'm so sorry for what he did to you.

438
00:29:07,624 --> 00:29:09,023
I feel responsible.

439
00:29:09,024 --> 00:29:10,663
It wasn't you.

440
00:29:10,664 --> 00:29:14,664
It used to be. Part of me.

441
00:29:15,024 --> 00:29:19,024
I'm sorry.

442
00:29:46,664 --> 00:29:50,063
The things I did when he was inside
me.

443
00:29:50,064 --> 00:29:52,903
Lying, and cheating.

444
00:29:52,904 --> 00:29:56,143
To think I could do that to your mum.

445
00:29:56,144 --> 00:29:58,023
It would break her heart if she knew.

446
00:29:58,024 --> 00:30:00,583
I know. We've all done
horrible shit, haven't we?

447
00:30:00,584 --> 00:30:03,903
This was a good thing we did.
Weren't it?

448
00:30:03,904 --> 00:30:06,223
Mm?

449
00:30:06,224 --> 00:30:08,103
What?

450
00:30:08,104 --> 00:30:10,743
I'm proud of you. Huh.

451
00:30:10,744 --> 00:30:13,543
I'm going fishing on Sunday.

452
00:30:13,544 --> 00:30:15,823
Why don't you come round
and keep your mum company?

453
00:30:15,824 --> 00:30:18,903
I'm sure she'll cook you a roast.
Yeah? Bring someone.

454
00:30:18,904 --> 00:30:22,383
A girlfriend. A boyfriend.

455
00:30:22,384 --> 00:30:25,263
What do you mean? No.
For fuck's sake, I'm not gay, Dad!

456
00:30:25,264 --> 00:30:27,183
You might be.

457
00:30:27,184 --> 00:30:31,184
Oh...!

458
00:30:48,344 --> 00:30:52,223
It's you.

459
00:30:52,224 --> 00:30:53,823
Were you smelling me?

460
00:30:53,824 --> 00:30:56,263
Mm.

461
00:30:56,264 --> 00:31:00,264
I found your scarf in the toilets.

462
00:31:02,384 --> 00:31:06,183
Thank you.
I thought I'd lost that. Thanks.

463
00:31:06,184 --> 00:31:10,184
How do you smell so nice?

464
00:31:12,144 --> 00:31:15,743
I don't know.

465
00:31:15,744 --> 00:31:18,503
Perfume? Regular showering?

466
00:31:18,504 --> 00:31:21,783
Yeah? Hm.

467
00:31:21,784 --> 00:31:24,663
Can I get you a drink?

468
00:31:24,664 --> 00:31:25,703
Oh... It's OK.

469
00:31:25,704 --> 00:31:29,183
I'm not going to drug you
and take you to my basement

470
00:31:29,184 --> 00:31:32,423
and rape you
with a massive strap-on.

471
00:31:32,424 --> 00:31:36,424
I live in a flat,
and it doesn't have a basement.

472
00:31:37,984 --> 00:31:40,543
I'm not being funny,
but you're really strange.

473
00:31:40,544 --> 00:31:43,423
Mm. It's cos I don't know who I am.

474
00:31:43,424 --> 00:31:45,983
What do you mean,
you don't know who you are?

475
00:31:45,984 --> 00:31:49,583
Well, I lost my memory
in that weird freak storm.

476
00:31:49,584 --> 00:31:53,183
I've tried to find out who I am,
but no-one's looking for me.

477
00:31:53,184 --> 00:31:56,224
Maybe no-one ever cared about me.
I don't know.

478
00:32:00,384 --> 00:32:02,743
I'm Laura.

479
00:32:02,744 --> 00:32:04,463
I'm Abby,

480
00:32:04,464 --> 00:32:08,464
and you are the nicest-smelling
person in the world.

481
00:32:32,664 --> 00:32:34,287
Hello, Geoff.

482
00:32:37,568 --> 00:32:40,469
Can you smell that, man? That smells
like a brand-new day, that does.

483
00:32:42,128 --> 00:32:44,047
It smells disgusting.
What have you been eating?

484
00:32:44,048 --> 00:32:48,048
It smells like Dad, our dad, our real
dad, isn't a murderous woman-beater.

485
00:32:48,288 --> 00:32:52,288
It smells like he uses his fists for
better things, things like, erm...

486
00:32:56,368 --> 00:32:59,127
I can't really think of anything good
a fist is used for.

487
00:32:59,128 --> 00:33:02,847
There is that certain section of the, er...
lesbian community that seem to enjoy it.

488
00:33:02,848 --> 00:33:05,687
You got to admire their fortitude,
really, haven't you? Full fist.

489
00:33:05,688 --> 00:33:08,007
Oh, mate, it smells like
possibilities.

490
00:33:08,008 --> 00:33:10,447
It smells like one of Mum's roast
dinners. Lamb or beef?

491
00:33:10,448 --> 00:33:14,207
I'm going to go with lamb. Baa!

492
00:33:14,208 --> 00:33:15,647
I want... I want to meet 'em.

493
00:33:15,648 --> 00:33:17,287
Eh?

494
00:33:17,288 --> 00:33:21,288
I want to meet Mum and Dad,
as... as me, outside of you.

495
00:33:22,288 --> 00:33:23,607
They're my parents as well.

496
00:33:23,608 --> 00:33:26,727
I've got all the same feelings
and memories as you have, you know.

497
00:33:26,728 --> 00:33:30,207
No, they're not your parents.
Dude, Mum gave birth to me. Me.

498
00:33:30,208 --> 00:33:31,727
You never even touched her vagina,

499
00:33:31,728 --> 00:33:34,167
and I'll tell you something else,
you never will.

500
00:33:34,168 --> 00:33:35,887
You never will touch it.

501
00:33:35,888 --> 00:33:38,767
Strike that image.
Get rid of it. It's awful.

502
00:33:38,768 --> 00:33:42,768
I...I just... I wanted to meet 'em.
I wanted to meet 'em as myself.

503
00:33:43,808 --> 00:33:47,367
You know, and Dad's going to understand.
He's been through thesame thing. So...

504
00:33:47,368 --> 00:33:51,368
What? And I suppose if Dad... Dad had
cancer, you'd want that too, would you?

505
00:33:52,688 --> 00:33:55,447
How have you got to cancer?!
Because that's what you are.

506
00:33:55,448 --> 00:33:58,847
You're a friggin' horrible cancerous
tumour thing, just growing in...

507
00:33:58,848 --> 00:34:00,367
You feed off me.

508
00:34:00,368 --> 00:34:02,407
You just hold me back and stuff,
don't ya?

509
00:34:02,408 --> 00:34:05,727
Is that really...
Is that really how you see me?

510
00:34:05,728 --> 00:34:07,847
Only sometimes,
when you're being a total dick.

511
00:34:07,848 --> 00:34:11,527
Come on, man. Just forget about
all the silly nonsense about cancer.

512
00:34:11,528 --> 00:34:14,087
Get in here and let's go.
Come on, man.

513
00:34:14,088 --> 00:34:17,767
Smell the lamb, smell it.

514
00:34:17,768 --> 00:34:18,807
Or beef.

515
00:34:18,808 --> 00:34:22,808
No. No, I either go as me,
or I'm not going at all.

516
00:34:22,968 --> 00:34:24,967
Just have a little think about it,
cos, er...

517
00:34:24,968 --> 00:34:28,327
No! Fuck off!
No roast dinner for you, moron.

518
00:34:28,328 --> 00:34:31,167
But you can't... you can't deny me
for ever, you know.

519
00:34:31,168 --> 00:34:35,168
Well, denied, mate.

520
00:34:41,248 --> 00:34:45,248
Oh, shit.

521
00:34:48,248 --> 00:34:52,248
He'll be all right.

522
00:34:52,568 --> 00:34:56,568
Oh, honestly, Mum, this is...
oh, this is top-notch.

523
00:34:56,728 --> 00:34:59,487
There's someone coming round later
and I want you to meet 'em.

524
00:34:59,488 --> 00:35:03,488
Who is it?
It's a bit of a surprise, actually.

525
00:35:14,368 --> 00:35:15,607
Rudy?

526
00:35:15,608 --> 00:35:19,608
What is it?

527
00:35:20,608 --> 00:35:23,407
It's nothing.

528
00:35:23,408 --> 00:35:27,408
It's nothing. I'm... I'm all right.

529
00:35:30,088 --> 00:35:32,927
Going to get involved
in a bit of this.

530
00:35:32,928 --> 00:35:35,767
Mm.

531
00:35:35,768 --> 00:35:37,127
Plenty of that.

532
00:35:37,128 --> 00:35:40,407
Can I have some more mint sauce,
please, Mum? Haven't you got enough?

533
00:35:40,408 --> 00:35:43,887
Well, you can never have enough mint
sauce, really, can you, with lamb?

534
00:35:43,888 --> 00:35:45,807
Cheers, thanks, Mum.

535
00:35:45,808 --> 00:35:48,447
Cheers.

536
00:35:48,448 --> 00:35:51,087
What the friggin' hell
are you doing here?

537
00:35:51,088 --> 00:35:53,247
Me and your dad had an agreement.

538
00:35:53,248 --> 00:35:55,207
We agreed to stay away
from each other.

539
00:35:55,208 --> 00:35:59,208
And then someone who looks like me walks
into the bank and clears my bank account.

540
00:36:00,408 --> 00:36:03,527
He broke the agreement.
And now I'm breaking it too.

541
00:36:03,528 --> 00:36:06,087
What fucking agreement?
Oh, here she is.

542
00:36:06,088 --> 00:36:10,088
Do you know... do you know what
I'd really like with this right now?

543
00:36:10,448 --> 00:36:13,767
It's going to freak you out.
Horseradish sauce.

544
00:36:13,768 --> 00:36:16,327
What, with lamb?
I know! Please. Yes, please.

545
00:36:16,328 --> 00:36:19,287
It'd be awesome, cheers. It'd be
nice, it'd be just... just... that's all.

546
00:36:19,288 --> 00:36:22,807
I'm just thinking, just to take the edge
of the mint. You know what I mean?

547
00:36:22,808 --> 00:36:25,847
Cheers, Mum. Ha-ha. OK.

548
00:36:25,848 --> 00:36:28,047
Oh.

549
00:36:28,048 --> 00:36:29,967
Get out now, dickhead.

550
00:36:29,968 --> 00:36:32,367
I'm not going anywhere.
Fuck.

551
00:36:32,368 --> 00:36:34,647
I'm very comfortable
in the bosom of my family.

552
00:36:34,648 --> 00:36:37,007
It isn't your family!

553
00:36:37,008 --> 00:36:38,967
Get the fuck off out
of my bosom, dickhead.

554
00:36:38,968 --> 00:36:41,447
Oh, here she is.

555
00:36:41,448 --> 00:36:44,847
Oh, give me that, give me that.

556
00:36:44,848 --> 00:36:48,848
Mm. Oh, yeah.

557
00:36:54,128 --> 00:36:57,287
Mustard?

558
00:36:57,288 --> 00:37:01,288
You won't be able to taste your food.
Yeah, well, good. Cos it's disgusting.

559
00:37:01,728 --> 00:37:05,728
It disgusts me.
Rudy? Don't be so rude.

560
00:37:06,008 --> 00:37:09,087
Please can I just have
a little bit of mustard, please?

561
00:37:09,088 --> 00:37:11,527
Sorry, Mum. Cheers, Mum.

562
00:37:11,528 --> 00:37:13,487
Thank you.

563
00:37:13,488 --> 00:37:16,207
You have got exactly three seconds
to get out of this house

564
00:37:16,208 --> 00:37:19,407
or I swear to God I will not be held
responsible for my actions, boyo.

565
00:37:19,408 --> 00:37:23,408
One.

566
00:37:23,808 --> 00:37:27,007
Fucking two.

567
00:37:27,008 --> 00:37:29,807
Two and... and a half.

568
00:37:29,808 --> 00:37:32,167
Two and three quarters.

569
00:37:32,168 --> 00:37:35,567
Three. Dick.

570
00:37:35,568 --> 00:37:39,007
Don't you fucking touch my mum.
Seriously. Don't you fucking touch my mum.

571
00:37:39,008 --> 00:37:40,487
Oh, I'm going to touch her.

572
00:37:40,488 --> 00:37:43,807
I am going to fuck her brains out.

573
00:37:43,808 --> 00:37:47,807
And then I'm going to take that pathetic
excuse for a man she calls a husband

574
00:37:47,808 --> 00:37:49,887
and I'm going to cave
his fucking skull in!

575
00:37:49,888 --> 00:37:51,727
My dad?
What have you done with my dad?

576
00:37:51,728 --> 00:37:53,687
I am your dad.

577
00:37:53,688 --> 00:37:57,527
If you say anything to your mum,
I'll hurt her.

578
00:37:57,528 --> 00:38:01,007
I'll really hurt her.

579
00:38:01,008 --> 00:38:03,247
There's your mustard.
Give me that.

580
00:38:03,248 --> 00:38:07,248
Give me that right now. Yes.

581
00:38:15,128 --> 00:38:18,647
Can I have mine later and maybe have
pudding now and have this later?

582
00:38:18,648 --> 00:38:21,327
Not until you've finished
what's on your plate.

583
00:38:21,328 --> 00:38:25,328
Oh?
Tuck in, son.

584
00:38:27,088 --> 00:38:31,088
All right.

585
00:38:32,248 --> 00:38:36,248
Mm, mm.

586
00:38:42,248 --> 00:38:45,567
Oh! Rudy? You're going to make
yourself sick. No, I won't.

587
00:38:45,568 --> 00:38:49,568
It's delicious.

588
00:38:53,688 --> 00:38:55,767
Can I have some pudding, please?

589
00:38:55,768 --> 00:38:57,407
Can't you wait?

590
00:38:57,408 --> 00:39:00,687
No. Can't wait.

591
00:39:00,688 --> 00:39:04,688
Can I just have a little bit
of ice cream, Mum? Please?

592
00:39:07,208 --> 00:39:11,208
Oh...

593
00:39:22,328 --> 00:39:25,127
Where's Rudy?
Oh, he's gone. Huh!

594
00:39:25,128 --> 00:39:29,128
Said he wasn't feeling well.
I think it was all that mustard. Ha-ha!

595
00:39:29,488 --> 00:39:31,927
Do you know, I said to him
he was going to make himself sick.

596
00:39:31,928 --> 00:39:35,928
Heh-heh-heh. Ah.
Oh.

597
00:39:36,448 --> 00:39:40,448
You look beautiful today.

598
00:39:43,128 --> 00:39:47,128
Let's go to bed.

599
00:40:49,488 --> 00:40:53,488
Oh! Oh.

600
00:41:02,368 --> 00:41:04,607
Shit.

601
00:41:04,608 --> 00:41:06,847
Oh, fuck!

602
00:41:06,848 --> 00:41:09,807
Oh, no!
Rudy!

603
00:41:09,808 --> 00:41:13,487
Get off my mum!
Rudy! Rudy! What are you doing?

604
00:41:13,488 --> 00:41:16,607
It's not Dad! It's not Dad!
He's gone mental again!

605
00:41:16,608 --> 00:41:19,967
Stop it! Rudy, stop it!

606
00:41:19,968 --> 00:41:22,687
Geoff! Geoff! No!

607
00:41:22,688 --> 00:41:26,688
Oh! Geoff!
Look, you've hurt him!

608
00:41:28,328 --> 00:41:29,727
Geoff? Geoff, what are you doing?

609
00:41:29,728 --> 00:41:33,287
The little shit
needs to learn some respect.

610
00:41:33,288 --> 00:41:36,487
Geoff! Don't you touch him!

611
00:41:36,488 --> 00:41:38,807
Aah!
No, no, no!

612
00:41:38,808 --> 00:41:42,727
Mum! Mum! Mum!

613
00:41:42,728 --> 00:41:45,167
I know what you need, both of you.

614
00:41:45,168 --> 00:41:49,047
You need a fucking good beating.

615
00:41:49,048 --> 00:41:52,287
Aah!
Whoa!

616
00:41:52,288 --> 00:41:54,447
Are you all right?
Yeah.

617
00:41:54,448 --> 00:41:57,487
What is going on?
It isn't Dad!

618
00:41:57,488 --> 00:42:01,488
That's not Dad. Yeah, it is.
It is Dad but it's not.

619
00:42:01,848 --> 00:42:05,848
It's just... it's better if Dad
explains it, Mum. Christ.

620
00:42:06,448 --> 00:42:08,847
And who are you?
Er...

621
00:42:08,848 --> 00:42:12,848
That's Jessica, my girlfriend, Mum.

622
00:42:12,928 --> 00:42:15,487
Mum, this is Jessica.
Jessica, this is my mum.

623
00:42:15,488 --> 00:42:17,008
Hi.

624
00:42:32,008 --> 00:42:34,807
He told me everything.

625
00:42:34,808 --> 00:42:38,808
All the flings. All the affairs.

626
00:42:41,408 --> 00:42:45,408
There's nothing you can say
to hurt me.

627
00:42:45,688 --> 00:42:49,688
You come anywhere near my husband
or my son again and I'll kill you.

628
00:42:58,688 --> 00:43:02,688
It's so nice to finally meet
one of Rudy's girlfriends.

629
00:43:03,248 --> 00:43:05,647
We thought he was gay.
Rudy?

630
00:43:05,648 --> 00:43:07,407
Gay?

631
00:43:07,408 --> 00:43:11,408
He's a total slag.

632
00:43:12,008 --> 00:43:14,167
Erm... not... not a slag.

633
00:43:14,168 --> 00:43:16,567
I mean... I mean, he's lovely.

634
00:43:16,568 --> 00:43:20,568
Yes.

635
00:43:28,808 --> 00:43:31,407
She's lovely.
Yeah, she is.

636
00:43:31,408 --> 00:43:34,007
She's very lovely indeed, actually.

637
00:43:34,008 --> 00:43:36,367
She's...

638
00:43:36,368 --> 00:43:38,807
Are you in love with her?
Whoa! No, shut up, Dad.

639
00:43:38,808 --> 00:43:41,727
No, I'm not in love with her.
Listen to me, seriously.

640
00:43:41,728 --> 00:43:43,687
Jess is only here
pretending to be my girlfriend

641
00:43:43,688 --> 00:43:45,727
so that you and Mum
don't think I'm a gaylord.

642
00:43:45,728 --> 00:43:49,327
Oh, right. Whatever you say.

643
00:43:49,328 --> 00:43:53,328
Huh. Knob.

644
00:44:52,648 --> 00:44:55,887
Do you want to say something?

645
00:44:55,888 --> 00:44:59,888
You don't have to.

646
00:45:04,328 --> 00:45:06,567
Hi.

647
00:45:06,568 --> 00:45:09,767
My name's Sam.

648
00:45:09,768 --> 00:45:13,768
I can fly.

649
00:45:17,848 --> 00:45:19,447
He made me sing with him,

650
00:45:19,448 --> 00:45:22,167
in what can only be described
as a very rapey duet.

651
00:45:22,168 --> 00:45:24,887
Dance with me.

652
00:45:24,888 --> 00:45:28,247
I need to speak to you!

653
00:45:28,248 --> 00:45:30,327
About a jumper!

654
00:45:30,328 --> 00:45:32,327
Has anyone seen Abby?

655
00:45:32,328 --> 00:45:36,328
I'm holding each and every one of
you personally responsible for her.

656
00:45:40,288 --> 00:45:42,393
Scary's coming.

657
