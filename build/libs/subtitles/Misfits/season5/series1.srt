1
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:08,959
Jess, I...

2
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:12,960
Jess.

3
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:20,479
It's Alex.
They're giving him a lung transplant.

4
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:21,759
- Shit.
- I tell you now.

5
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:25,760
You don't want to be getting
a transplant round here.

6
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:14,359
Hi. How are you? OK?
Good. You're Alex, right?

7
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:17,039
I'm not being funny,
but you have to have sex with me.

8
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:18,919
I've only just got out of surgery.

9
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:21,039
You need to leave.
We're just talking.

10
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:23,519
Get him out of here.
Please! You have to fuck me!

11
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:26,320
Call security!
Think about it! Think about it!

12
00:01:26,360 --> 00:02:06,416

13
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:34,719
OK. Bye.

14
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,919
Alex is out of surgery.
He's going to be OK.

15
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:38,879
Ah! Get in, mate! Well done.

16
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:41,199
I tell you now, I never
doubted it for a second.

17
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,919
The handsome barman lives.

18
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:44,959
Come on. Dude, you need
to pay up right now.

19
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:46,559
That's 20 of your English pounds.

20
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,439
Fucking pygmy.
Let's have it, come on.

21
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:50,439
You... you put money on him dying?

22
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:51,719
Yeah!

23
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:55,720
No! No. What kind of person
do you think I am?

24
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:58,879
You said it would be funny
if they chopped his cock off

25
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:00,119
during the operation.

26
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:02,599
There's something very wrong
with you. Oh, Finn.

27
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:04,079
Honestly.

28
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:06,159
Well, I'm glad he didn't die. I am.

29
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:09,719
But I will say this.

30
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:11,599
He may have a new lung,

31
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:15,600
but you can't replace
his cheating heart.

32
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:21,080
Twat.

33
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:24,919
Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa!

34
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:27,719
Scouts, dude! Yes! You're Scouts.

35
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:30,839
These were the happiest and
the proudest days of my life.

36
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:31,959
Look at 'em!

37
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:33,759
You were in the Scouts?

38
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:36,119
That should never have been allowed.

39
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:39,439
I swore... I swore a solemn oath to,
you know, to obey the Scout Law,

40
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:41,639
to do my best, to do my duty to God

41
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:44,719
and Her lovely majestic
Majesty the Queen.

42
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:47,079
Huh. Lived by a code.
I were like a samurai warrior.

43
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:49,239
Yeah, that's... that's you all over.

44
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:51,319
And then... and then
they cast me out.

45
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:52,999
Why were you cast out?

46
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,159
I don't want to talk about it.

47
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:57,639
I will say this.

48
00:03:57,640 --> 00:04:00,079
A Scout is meant to walk an
impossible line

49
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:02,839
between his love of scouting
and his raging hormones

50
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:05,919
in the first flushes
of sexual adventure.

51
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:06,959
There are girls!

52
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:09,519
You're a girl! Shit!

53
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:12,759
That's an unnatural abomination.
This is not how Baden-Powell intended it!

54
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:16,519
Take that uniform off!
You look like a dick!

55
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:20,520
Shit.

56
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:23,879
Is he still staring?
He's really staring.

57
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:24,999
He's gone.

58
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,359
Look at 'em. Scouts... Scouts
is a time for boys to be boys.

59
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:31,159
You know, the... the first time
I masturbated. Scouts.

60
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:34,359
The first time I ever saw
another boy's penis. Scouts.

61
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:36,999
First time I touched
another boy's penis. Scouts.

62
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,919
First time another boy
touched my penis.

63
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:41,199
Scouts? It was in Scouts!

64
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:45,200
It was in Scouts. Happy,
sunlit days is what they were.

65
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:49,400
Oh, my God. Look at this tramp.

66
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:56,519
Hi.
Ahem. Hi. Ahem! Hi.

67
00:04:56,520 --> 00:05:00,119
What the fuck was that?

68
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:04,120
Shame on you, Finley!

69
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:10,840
You've got a visitor.

70
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:17,680
Handsome barman! Here he is.
How you diddling, mate?

71
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:21,559
Eh? I've brought you
some grapes and that.

72
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:23,479
I haven't brought you any grapes.

73
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:25,279
How's Jess?

74
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:29,280
She's dead.

75
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,359
She's not really dead.

76
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,560
I was just trying
to make you feel better.

77
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:38,799
So...

78
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,839
she didn't want to come and see me?

79
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:43,999
Yes, she did.
She wanted to come, but she...

80
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,559
She hates my guts, doesn't she?
She doesn't hate your guts, man.

81
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:50,479
Well, maybe. I don't know. She...
Do you... do you know what, man?

82
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:53,359
Who could ever possibly
understand the inner workings...

83
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,479
They've got little
fickle minds, mate.

84
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:57,839
My dad, he used to say to me,
you know, he used to say,

85
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:01,840
"Rudy, women are very much
like tractors."

86
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:04,839
Which I have never understood.

87
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:07,959
I think it's something, really,
to do with potatoes.

88
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:10,119
That's what it is. Shit.

89
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:14,120
They're just not like men,
seriously.

90
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,399
Hi.

91
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:33,479
What's this badge for?
Fire safety.

92
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:36,119
I know who to call
if there's a fire, then.

93
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:37,559
You should call the Fire Service,

94
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:40,559
activate the fire alarm and leave
by the nearest emergency exit.

95
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:44,560
Right, yeah. Good... good to know.
You know, always... be prepared.

96
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,679
What about this one?

97
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:52,479
Global Conservation.

98
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:56,480
First aid. Road safety.

99
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:00,759
This one here is for fucking.

100
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:03,159
Really? They...
they give badges for that?

101
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:04,639
No.

102
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:06,599
Yeah, I know.

103
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:09,000
Because of health and safety...

104
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:11,999
..and AIDS.

105
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Have you ever fucked a Scout before?

106
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:17,799
Have I?

107
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:20,159
That would be a... a no.

108
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,959
No, I haven't.

109
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:25,960
I...I fingered a Girl Guide, though.

110
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:34,799
Do you mind if I tie you up?

111
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:37,519
You are full of surprises. Go for it.

112
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:40,479
I hate to sound like my dad,
but are you over 16?

113
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:44,480
I'm 18. Ah.

114
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:49,399
What type of knot are you using?

115
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:53,400
A double constrictor knot,
almost impossible to get out of.

116
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:57,360
Ooh, good choice.

117
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:04,079
OK. Now lie down.

118
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,520
Right there.

119
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:13,759
He's ready.

120
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:15,999
Oh! Oh!

121
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,399
Oh!

122
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:21,400
Oh, shit.

123
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:25,279
- Hi.
- Oh!

124
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:28,959
Shit. Do you want tell me
what the fuck is going on?

125
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:30,999
You are to become one of us.

126
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,959
A Scout? Can't I just
fill in a membership form?

127
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:37,519
You are to become an agent of Satan.

128
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:41,520
And if I say no?

129
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:44,599
Oh, shit. Shit.

130
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:48,079
Then I'll cut out your heart
and burn it in hellfire.

131
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:49,839
Is that a chicken?

132
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:52,679
Oh, you... you've got the wrong guy.

133
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:54,519
I'd make a terrible agent of Satan.

134
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:58,520
I'm... I'm lazy, and...
and disorganised,

135
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:01,159
and ask anyone who knows me,
I'm... I'm shit.

136
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:04,559
Ecce Satanas meo...

137
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:07,479
sicut ego et ipse regnabit Dominus

138
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:09,039
super terram

139
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:11,560
meam tenebris...

140
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:14,199
Jesus! Fuck!

141
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,559
You killed the chicken!

142
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:19,560
Lucifer habitabunt in te!

143
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:27,600
Aah! Aah!

144
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:35,520
Aah.

145
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:44,599
You should see his scar.

146
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:47,719
Dude looks like Action Man.
What an handsome barman!

147
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:50,799
You've seen him?
Of course I've bloody seen him.

148
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:54,759
We're best mates. Some people say...

149
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:56,959
..we look like brothers. Ahem!

150
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:58,679
You're best mates? Mm-hm.

151
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:00,319
Really? Erm... what's his surname?

152
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:03,239
Kagi... Kagillima.

153
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:06,599
Kagillima?
It's... it's...

154
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:09,399
it's Wong... Smith.

155
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:12,679
Wong-Smith?
I know. It's ridiculous, innit?

156
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:15,639
So, you know how the handsome
barman saved your life?

157
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:18,119
Does that cancel him out
shagging that girl?

158
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:21,159
Cos it feels about the same to me.

159
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:22,439
Why are you so interested?

160
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:25,359
Because if you stop seeing him,
he'll just... he'll leave, won't he?

161
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:27,639
He'll wander from town to town
like The Littlest Hobo.

162
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:31,320
And, Jess, I don't know whether my fragile
heart could ever take any more of...

163
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:35,279
You're not going to believe
what's just happened to me.

164
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:37,719
Were you bent over double again,
sucking yourself off,

165
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:39,879
bit of pollen's gone up your nose,
you've sneezed,

166
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:41,479
you've bit the tip off your penis...

167
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:43,239
No!

168
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:44,535
Oh, come on.

169
00:10:52,039 --> 00:10:55,038
? Gonna throw it back to you

170
00:10:55,039 --> 00:10:57,118
? By now you should've somehow... ?

171
00:10:57,119 --> 00:11:00,398
? Realised what you gotta do

172
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:04,399
? I don't believe that
anybody feels the way I do

173
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:07,118
? About you now. ?
Yeah.

174
00:11:07,119 --> 00:11:09,918
They don't look
like agents of Satan.

175
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:13,398
Of course they don't look
like agents of Satan.

176
00:11:13,399 --> 00:11:16,478
Agents of Satan never look
like agents of Satan, do they?

177
00:11:16,479 --> 00:11:17,699
Mm.

178
00:11:17,784 --> 00:11:20,023
You don't believe me, do you?

179
00:11:20,024 --> 00:11:23,463
You think it's all just a desperately
sad and lonely cry for attention.

180
00:11:23,464 --> 00:11:26,343
Yeah, well, I told them you were
capable of anything, mate, so...

181
00:11:26,344 --> 00:11:30,103
Oh, when you come in tied up,
covered in chicken blood...

182
00:11:30,104 --> 00:11:32,423
What's that? Chicken blood?

183
00:11:32,424 --> 00:11:33,543
Hm?

184
00:11:33,544 --> 00:11:36,463
It was Finley.

185
00:11:36,464 --> 00:11:38,583
What? It was Finley.

186
00:11:38,584 --> 00:11:42,584
Oh.

187
00:11:46,304 --> 00:11:49,143
Have you been running
an illegal slaughterhouse

188
00:11:49,144 --> 00:11:50,583
in my community centre?

189
00:11:50,584 --> 00:11:52,383
No.

190
00:11:52,384 --> 00:11:56,384
If I find out you have been
supplying local restaurants

191
00:11:56,744 --> 00:11:59,823
and kebab houses with dodgy meat...

192
00:11:59,824 --> 00:12:02,463
You won't, cos I haven't.

193
00:12:02,464 --> 00:12:06,023
Then we don't have a problem, do we?

194
00:12:06,024 --> 00:12:10,024
No. No.

195
00:12:10,544 --> 00:12:14,544
? You're my wonderwall... ?

196
00:12:16,704 --> 00:12:20,704
Pussy.

197
00:12:32,224 --> 00:12:33,783
Hi. It's me.

198
00:12:33,784 --> 00:12:35,343
How do you know where I live?

199
00:12:35,344 --> 00:12:39,223
So, I guess I kind of followed
you home from the hospital.

200
00:12:39,224 --> 00:12:43,143
Don't freak out. Look, I don't know
what your problem is. I don't care.

201
00:12:43,144 --> 00:12:46,503
So, can you just piss off?

202
00:12:46,504 --> 00:12:49,583
Oh, fuck! Oh!

203
00:12:49,584 --> 00:12:52,543
Fuck!

204
00:12:52,544 --> 00:12:55,303
The door slamming like that.
It wasn't an accident.

205
00:12:55,304 --> 00:12:58,543
Well, it was, but it was me.

206
00:12:58,544 --> 00:13:00,463
I've got this power.

207
00:13:00,464 --> 00:13:04,464
I cause accidents. It's a nightmare.
Neil said he could make it stop.

208
00:13:04,984 --> 00:13:07,183
Who's Neil?

209
00:13:07,184 --> 00:13:10,823
You've got his lung.
They transplanted it into you.

210
00:13:10,824 --> 00:13:14,303
He had this power. He could fuck
other people's powers out of them.

211
00:13:14,304 --> 00:13:18,304
He was going to fuck my power
out of me. Is that what he told you?

212
00:13:18,584 --> 00:13:20,263
He was after a shag.

213
00:13:20,264 --> 00:13:23,663
I've spoken to people he helped.
He took their power.

214
00:13:23,664 --> 00:13:26,063
His power's been
transplanted into you.

215
00:13:26,064 --> 00:13:29,543
Is this a wind-up?

216
00:13:29,544 --> 00:13:32,983
Did Jess put you up to this?

217
00:13:32,984 --> 00:13:36,984
It's a test, isn't it?
And if I shag you then I fail.

218
00:13:37,344 --> 00:13:39,383
Well. Ha!

219
00:13:39,384 --> 00:13:43,384
Good try. Because
it's not going to happen.

220
00:13:47,504 --> 00:13:50,383
Seriously.

221
00:13:50,384 --> 00:13:52,423
Take a hint.

222
00:13:52,424 --> 00:13:54,743
The catch on the
dishwasher door broke.

223
00:13:54,744 --> 00:13:58,503
I tripped over it,
fell on a potato peeler.

224
00:13:58,504 --> 00:14:02,504
The handle of a mug of tea
snapped off as I was drinking it.

225
00:14:07,184 --> 00:14:08,703
Jesus.

226
00:14:08,704 --> 00:14:12,704
There was a loose paving slab
at the top of a flight of steps.

227
00:14:14,784 --> 00:14:18,784
I don't even remember
what all these are.

228
00:14:25,424 --> 00:14:29,063
That's just a birthmark.

229
00:14:29,064 --> 00:14:31,503
I've got money. I'll pay you.

230
00:14:31,504 --> 00:14:35,504
I don't... I don't want your money.

231
00:14:40,624 --> 00:14:43,023
You cheated on me,
and I can't forgive you for that.

232
00:14:43,024 --> 00:14:45,303
Maybe I should be able
to get over it because

233
00:14:45,304 --> 00:14:47,343
I really fucking like you,
but I can't.

234
00:14:47,344 --> 00:14:50,143
We were together and
you shagged her,

235
00:14:50,144 --> 00:14:53,143
and I really fucking
hate you for that,

236
00:14:53,144 --> 00:14:57,144
but then you go and get yourself
stabbed for me and you save my life.

237
00:14:58,344 --> 00:15:01,463
Why did you shag her?

238
00:15:01,464 --> 00:15:02,623
Why would you do that?

239
00:15:02,624 --> 00:15:06,624
Because now I have to end it with
you and that is really fucking hard!

240
00:15:09,944 --> 00:15:13,944
Say something, then, you dick.

241
00:15:15,264 --> 00:15:17,463
I promise...

242
00:15:17,464 --> 00:15:21,383
it is not what you think.

243
00:15:21,384 --> 00:15:23,383
Oh, my God. No.

244
00:15:23,384 --> 00:15:26,463
No, no, no, no, no, no.
No. It's not like that.

245
00:15:26,464 --> 00:15:30,343
You unbelievable fucking twat!
You just made it so much easier!

246
00:15:30,344 --> 00:15:33,623
It's a power thing, Jess!

247
00:15:33,624 --> 00:15:36,544
Please can we fuck now?
You're not helping!

248
00:15:57,224 --> 00:15:59,383
Well.

249
00:15:59,384 --> 00:16:01,623
Look who it is.

250
00:16:01,624 --> 00:16:05,624
Yeah, well, look who it is...
right back at you.

251
00:16:06,744 --> 00:16:10,463
Have you seen this?
I'm going to have a scar.

252
00:16:10,464 --> 00:16:13,143
You were trying to convert me
into an agent of Satan.

253
00:16:13,144 --> 00:16:17,144
You don't have to worry
about that any more.

254
00:16:17,344 --> 00:16:21,344
I'm going to rip out your heart
and shove it up your arse.

255
00:16:27,424 --> 00:16:29,903
Rudy!

256
00:16:29,904 --> 00:16:33,904
Guys, a little help!

257
00:16:48,664 --> 00:16:52,664
Seriously?

258
00:16:53,824 --> 00:16:57,824
Whoa!

259
00:17:04,104 --> 00:17:07,783
Who's laughing now?

260
00:17:07,784 --> 00:17:10,583
Hoc cecidit angelus devorabit vos!

261
00:17:10,584 --> 00:17:11,783
Rudy!

262
00:17:11,784 --> 00:17:15,263
Resident in tua anima, mea tenebris
emergere reget hoc mundo!

263
00:17:15,264 --> 00:17:16,823
Fuck off! Fuck off!

264
00:17:16,824 --> 00:17:20,824
Lucifer reget hoc mundo,
ego reget huius mundi pro aeterno!

265
00:17:41,464 --> 00:17:43,383
You've killed the Scout leader.

266
00:17:43,384 --> 00:17:45,823
See, I told you he
was trying to ki...

267
00:17:45,824 --> 00:17:47,743
Ah. What's wrong with you?

268
00:17:47,744 --> 00:17:50,183
She dared me to swallow
my full Cornetto in one go, man.

269
00:17:50,184 --> 00:17:51,703
It's given me the worse brain...

270
00:17:51,704 --> 00:17:53,623
I thought I were going
to die for a minute.

271
00:17:53,624 --> 00:17:56,223
We got you one.

272
00:17:56,224 --> 00:17:57,543
Ooh. Thanks.

273
00:17:57,544 --> 00:18:01,544
Hey, monkey boy, you done good
there. From wankster...

274
00:18:03,744 --> 00:18:07,063
..to... to gangster.
That's a G. Yeah.

275
00:18:07,064 --> 00:18:09,523
We should probably bury him.

276
00:18:09,524 --> 00:18:12,788
I'll get the shovels. Ah.

277
00:18:34,198 --> 00:18:36,417
Loop it over once.

278
00:18:36,418 --> 00:18:38,258
Twice.

279
00:18:38,266 --> 00:18:40,025
Left over right.

280
00:18:40,026 --> 00:18:41,985
Through the rabbit hole.

281
00:18:41,986 --> 00:18:43,385
Bastard!

282
00:18:43,386 --> 00:18:46,945
I just thought...

283
00:18:46,946 --> 00:18:48,665
For God's sake.

284
00:18:48,666 --> 00:18:50,905
What?

285
00:18:50,906 --> 00:18:53,305
Fucking what?
What are you staring at?

286
00:18:53,306 --> 00:18:56,465
What, you never seen a grown man in
his childhood Scout uniform before?

287
00:18:56,466 --> 00:18:58,625
You need to get out more, pal.

288
00:18:58,626 --> 00:19:00,065
Just take that.

289
00:19:00,066 --> 00:19:02,265
What's this? What am I looking at?

290
00:19:02,266 --> 00:19:05,745
It's a support group.
It's for people with powers.

291
00:19:05,746 --> 00:19:08,785
And I think we should...
I think we should go.

292
00:19:08,786 --> 00:19:10,425
Do you?
Well, yeah, it's a...

293
00:19:10,426 --> 00:19:13,546
it's a good opportunity to...
for us to talk about our situation.

294
00:19:13,646 --> 00:19:14,805
Bastard!

295
00:19:14,806 --> 00:19:18,806
...in a... in a non-judgmental,
confidential environment.

296
00:19:19,806 --> 00:19:22,645
What situation?
There is no situation, dude.

297
00:19:22,646 --> 00:19:26,646
There's absolutely
nothing to see here!

298
00:19:27,606 --> 00:19:30,485
I just think... I think we need to
talk about our future, together.

299
00:19:30,486 --> 00:19:34,486
And I just... I thought you might
want to be with me while we do it.

300
00:19:54,686 --> 00:19:56,605
For crying out loud!
Look at Finley, eh?

301
00:19:56,606 --> 00:19:59,205
Look at him. Frigging
confident and flirtatious.

302
00:19:59,206 --> 00:20:02,605
Dibs on that bloody fragrant
blonde he's talking to.

303
00:20:02,606 --> 00:20:05,285
Why are you telling us?

304
00:20:05,286 --> 00:20:07,005
It's not who you tell.

305
00:20:07,006 --> 00:20:10,205
It's the act of saying it out loud
that makes it legally binding.

306
00:20:10,206 --> 00:20:13,405
I don't make the bloody rules,
love, but I will abide by them.

307
00:20:13,406 --> 00:20:16,525
Shit.
Mm? Here he is!

308
00:20:16,526 --> 00:20:19,685
Handsome barman. Ali G in the house.
See what I did there?

309
00:20:19,686 --> 00:20:21,645
Dude, see what... Cos your name's...

310
00:20:21,646 --> 00:20:23,845
Cos your name's Alex.
I just put a G on it.

311
00:20:23,846 --> 00:20:26,725
It's not what you think.
Seriously. I'm not interested.

312
00:20:26,726 --> 00:20:30,685
Yeah, but I didn't even shag her.
Oh, no way. He's done it again!

313
00:20:30,686 --> 00:20:33,366
Mongrel. Look here.

314
00:20:34,766 --> 00:20:37,765
Can we please do this somewhere else?

315
00:20:37,766 --> 00:20:39,925
Do what somewhere else?

316
00:20:39,926 --> 00:20:43,765
She found him shagging
another girl. That's twice now.

317
00:20:43,766 --> 00:20:46,045
Why am I not surprised?

318
00:20:46,046 --> 00:20:50,046
Seriously. Don't.

319
00:20:51,566 --> 00:20:55,566
Oh, am... am I supposed to be scared?

320
00:21:03,086 --> 00:21:05,085
Finn!
Are you scared now?

321
00:21:05,086 --> 00:21:06,685
Fuck off, you little prick!

322
00:21:06,686 --> 00:21:10,525
Finlay? What are you doing with
the handsome barman? Put him down!

323
00:21:10,526 --> 00:21:14,005
Stop it! Stop it!

324
00:21:14,006 --> 00:21:16,485
He will always shit on you,
cos that's who he is.

325
00:21:16,486 --> 00:21:18,325
He can't help himself.

326
00:21:18,326 --> 00:21:22,326
You need to wake up
and smell the arsehole.

327
00:21:30,726 --> 00:21:33,725
Hey!

328
00:21:33,726 --> 00:21:37,726
Hey! I thought of a good reason
why you should fuck me!

329
00:21:55,006 --> 00:21:57,365
There's definitely
something going on with Finn.

330
00:21:57,366 --> 00:22:00,445
Oh, yeah, I think he's
going through puberty.

331
00:22:00,446 --> 00:22:03,605
You know, it's a very
confusing time for any young man.

332
00:22:03,606 --> 00:22:07,606
I thought you said you were going to
talk to him. And I did.

333
00:22:07,686 --> 00:22:10,445
What did he say? Well, I had to wait
for the right moment, you know.

334
00:22:10,446 --> 00:22:12,885
I sat him down,
just put my arm around him.

335
00:22:12,886 --> 00:22:16,725
We just sat there for a moment,
bit of quiet contemplation, one man,

336
00:22:16,726 --> 00:22:18,526
another substantially smaller man.

337
00:22:20,606 --> 00:22:21,925
And?

338
00:22:21,926 --> 00:22:24,885
He went, "I'm fine. I'm good."

339
00:22:24,886 --> 00:22:26,125
So, we're actually no closer

340
00:22:26,126 --> 00:22:28,765
to knowing why Finn was
behaving like a total psycho?

341
00:22:28,766 --> 00:22:31,245
Oh, for God's sake, Jess.
When a man wants to talk to you,

342
00:22:31,246 --> 00:22:33,325
you're going to see
his lips moving like this.

343
00:22:33,326 --> 00:22:37,326
And when he doesn't, he's in...
in his special quiet place,

344
00:22:38,006 --> 00:22:42,006
a shed of the mind.

345
00:23:21,846 --> 00:23:25,005
Hello. Welcome to the group.

346
00:23:25,006 --> 00:23:29,006
Take a seat.

347
00:23:49,086 --> 00:23:52,845
Why don't you tell us who you are
and a little bit about your power?

348
00:23:52,846 --> 00:23:56,846
Erm...

349
00:23:58,766 --> 00:24:01,725
I'm Rudy.

350
00:24:01,726 --> 00:24:04,805
Well, Rudy Two.

351
00:24:04,806 --> 00:24:08,806
And I was created by the storm.

352
00:24:08,846 --> 00:24:12,846
I suppose you could say...

353
00:24:12,886 --> 00:24:16,886
..I'm the living embodiment
of a split personality disorder.

354
00:24:18,326 --> 00:24:19,965
Hi, Rudy Two.

355
00:24:19,966 --> 00:24:23,645
Hi, Rudy Two.

356
00:24:23,646 --> 00:24:26,086
Hiya.

357
00:24:32,086 --> 00:24:36,086
Hi.

358
00:24:37,326 --> 00:24:41,326
Look, I... I don't even know
if I've got this bloke's power.

359
00:24:42,846 --> 00:24:46,846
There's only one way to find out.
Slip it up there.

360
00:24:50,926 --> 00:24:53,205
Do we have to have full sex?

361
00:24:53,206 --> 00:24:57,206
I don't know if coming on my tits
is really going to cut it.

362
00:24:57,366 --> 00:24:59,285
I just don't want to hurt you.

363
00:24:59,286 --> 00:25:03,286
I'm so stuffed full of painkillers
I won't feel a thing.

364
00:25:08,566 --> 00:25:12,566
This is a chance to use
your cock for good.

365
00:25:51,406 --> 00:25:54,365
What's the story
with you and that girl?

366
00:25:54,366 --> 00:25:57,045
I messed up. I cheated on her.

367
00:25:57,046 --> 00:25:59,325
You still like her?

368
00:25:59,326 --> 00:26:02,005
Yeah.

369
00:26:02,006 --> 00:26:04,205
So, why did you cheat on her?

370
00:26:04,206 --> 00:26:08,206
Can we talk about something else?
Whatever you like.

371
00:26:08,686 --> 00:26:11,205
I fucking hate guys like you.
Oh, do you want me to stop?

372
00:26:11,206 --> 00:26:12,845
Cos there's plenty of
girls I can fuck

373
00:26:12,846 --> 00:26:16,846
that don't look like
a big bag of shit and blood.

374
00:26:17,286 --> 00:26:18,805
Sorry.

375
00:26:18,806 --> 00:26:21,725
I shouldn't have said anything.
No, I... I can't do this.

376
00:26:21,726 --> 00:26:25,726
Please. I'm sorry.

377
00:26:31,166 --> 00:26:33,325
How do we know when it's worked?

378
00:26:33,326 --> 00:26:37,326
I don't know.

379
00:26:40,406 --> 00:26:42,165
Oh, Jesus.

380
00:26:42,166 --> 00:26:43,965
Are you coming?

381
00:26:43,966 --> 00:26:47,966
No, it's, er... mm, it's something
else. What the fuck is that?

382
00:27:01,126 --> 00:27:03,725
Oh.

383
00:27:03,726 --> 00:27:07,005
Oh.

384
00:27:07,006 --> 00:27:11,006
Thank you.

385
00:27:24,246 --> 00:27:25,606
Well, Barbara...

386
00:27:30,526 --> 00:27:34,526
Rudy?

387
00:27:34,686 --> 00:27:38,085
All right, Finn? Is this
a dream? You look taller.

388
00:27:38,086 --> 00:27:40,205
I've got something for you.

389
00:27:40,206 --> 00:27:42,405
Oh! Is it a present?

390
00:27:42,406 --> 00:27:44,605
You'll see.
A present for my birthday!

391
00:27:44,606 --> 00:27:46,925
It's a surprise.

392
00:27:46,926 --> 00:27:50,245
Is it Scalextric?
I bloody love Scalextric!

393
00:27:50,246 --> 00:27:54,246
Take me to it!
Take me... take me to it.

394
00:27:54,966 --> 00:27:58,565
Hey. Oh.

395
00:27:58,566 --> 00:28:00,165
Yeah.

396
00:28:00,166 --> 00:28:03,005
I like what you've done here, the
chicken and the candles and stuff.

397
00:28:03,006 --> 00:28:04,325
I don't even know what this is.

398
00:28:04,326 --> 00:28:06,965
I can see you've gone to a lot
of trouble, dude, but I just...

399
00:28:06,966 --> 00:28:10,966
Shit, man, I kind of had my heart
set on Scalextric a little bit.

400
00:28:11,166 --> 00:28:12,645
Ecce Satanas meo...

401
00:28:12,646 --> 00:28:15,365
Hey.
..sicut ego et ipse regnabit

402
00:28:15,366 --> 00:28:17,605
meam tenebris.

403
00:28:17,606 --> 00:28:20,205
What, are we speaking French, eh?
Je m'appelle Rudy!

404
00:28:20,206 --> 00:28:24,206
Dude, j'habite la community centre.

405
00:28:27,166 --> 00:28:28,685
Finn?

406
00:28:28,686 --> 00:28:31,445
What the fuck?

407
00:28:31,446 --> 00:28:35,446
Finn?

408
00:29:04,246 --> 00:29:05,805
Finn's the devil.

409
00:29:05,806 --> 00:29:08,845
Or... or at least an agent of Satan,
or whatever they call themselves.

410
00:29:08,846 --> 00:29:11,005
That's why he's been
acting so weird.

411
00:29:11,006 --> 00:29:14,805
When he killed that, erm...
Scout leader guy, I... I don't...

412
00:29:14,806 --> 00:29:17,845
I...I don't know, I think
something...

413
00:29:17,846 --> 00:29:19,765
I think happened to him.

414
00:29:19,766 --> 00:29:22,045
Finn?

415
00:29:22,046 --> 00:29:25,405
No. He's too short to be the devil.

416
00:29:25,406 --> 00:29:28,685
You're bleeding.

417
00:29:28,686 --> 00:29:32,245
Mm.

418
00:29:32,246 --> 00:29:34,605
I've got my period.

419
00:29:34,606 --> 00:29:38,606
What are you hiding
behind your back?

420
00:29:38,726 --> 00:29:42,726
Nothing.

421
00:29:48,006 --> 00:29:52,006
It's a dead chicken.

422
00:29:55,006 --> 00:29:57,405
You're one of them.

423
00:29:57,406 --> 00:30:01,406
Do you want to know something?
You're next.

424
00:30:12,726 --> 00:30:14,165
Hiya, Jess.

425
00:30:14,166 --> 00:30:15,805
I know what you are.

426
00:30:15,806 --> 00:30:18,525
I'm just a cheeky little Scouser.

427
00:30:18,526 --> 00:30:20,445
Eh? Eh?

428
00:30:20,446 --> 00:30:23,045
Eh? Calm down! Calm down!

429
00:30:23,046 --> 00:30:25,965
You're the devil.

430
00:30:25,966 --> 00:30:28,885
The devil.

431
00:30:28,886 --> 00:30:29,925
What's she like?

432
00:30:29,926 --> 00:30:31,725
She's hilarious.

433
00:30:31,726 --> 00:30:34,405
So funny. You're funny.

434
00:30:34,406 --> 00:30:36,765
She's... she's one of you!
You've converted her!

435
00:30:36,766 --> 00:30:38,925
No.

436
00:30:38,926 --> 00:30:41,485
It's all in that pretty
little head of yours.

437
00:30:41,486 --> 00:30:44,605
Oh, fuck it, fuck it, fuck it!

438
00:30:44,606 --> 00:30:46,125
Shitting hell.

439
00:30:46,126 --> 00:30:50,125
Chickens are fed, dude. So...

440
00:30:50,126 --> 00:30:52,605
I meant... monkeys.

441
00:30:52,606 --> 00:30:56,606
Shit. Shit! Fuck!

442
00:30:56,766 --> 00:30:58,210
That's bad.

443
00:31:23,405 --> 00:31:26,284
I, er... I haven't had sex with
anyone. I've just been in the shower.

444
00:31:26,285 --> 00:31:30,285
Believe it or not, the world
does not revolve around your cock!

445
00:31:30,845 --> 00:31:34,205
Bit harsh.

446
00:31:34,299 --> 00:31:35,578
So, what are you going to do?

447
00:31:35,579 --> 00:31:38,498
I don't know. I can't go back to the
community centre. I can't go home.

448
00:31:38,499 --> 00:31:40,018
They'll be looking for me.

449
00:31:40,019 --> 00:31:42,778
Well, um... you know, you can...

450
00:31:42,779 --> 00:31:45,698
You can stay here
tonight if... if you want.

451
00:31:45,699 --> 00:31:48,818
My friends have been turned into
agents of Satan,

452
00:31:48,819 --> 00:31:51,418
and you're coming on to me?
You are unbelievable!

453
00:31:51,419 --> 00:31:54,218
I can't do anything right
by you, can I?

454
00:31:54,219 --> 00:31:56,738
Oh! That's hot coffee!

455
00:31:56,739 --> 00:32:00,739
It's warm coffee.

456
00:32:08,379 --> 00:32:09,418
Jessica.

457
00:32:09,419 --> 00:32:11,538
It's Rudy. He's one of them.

458
00:32:11,539 --> 00:32:13,258
It's... it's Rudy Two.

459
00:32:13,259 --> 00:32:17,259
Are you in there? Rudy One's
turned into an agent of Satan.

460
00:32:19,019 --> 00:32:20,658
I just... I just don't
know what to do.

461
00:32:20,659 --> 00:32:24,659
I thought you might be in there
with the handsome barman.

462
00:32:25,419 --> 00:32:29,419
Jess?

463
00:32:31,779 --> 00:32:34,298
You all right?

464
00:32:34,299 --> 00:32:36,298
So, Finn's got this book
on satanic rites,

465
00:32:36,299 --> 00:32:38,778
and it says the only way
to drive Satan out of anybody

466
00:32:38,779 --> 00:32:41,138
is to douse them in holy water
and you've got to...

467
00:32:41,139 --> 00:32:44,218
You've got to read
this little passage here.

468
00:32:44,219 --> 00:32:46,898
That's great, only
I'm fresh out of holy water.

469
00:32:46,899 --> 00:32:50,498
Well, I went to the church
on the way here, so...

470
00:32:50,499 --> 00:32:52,818
Sprite? No.

471
00:32:52,819 --> 00:32:55,458
No, it's holy water. I
filled it up from the font, guys,

472
00:32:55,459 --> 00:32:57,579
on the way here.

473
00:32:59,419 --> 00:33:03,419
Finn and Rudy said they were going
to the bar later on tonight, so...

474
00:33:04,259 --> 00:33:06,618
I suppose you want me to help you?

475
00:33:06,619 --> 00:33:09,618
Yeah.

476
00:33:09,619 --> 00:33:13,619
Oh.

477
00:33:30,699 --> 00:33:34,458
I'm thinking about getting
a raven as a pet.

478
00:33:34,459 --> 00:33:36,298
What?

479
00:33:36,299 --> 00:33:39,498
I feel stupid asking.
Is it that raven to replace me?

480
00:33:39,499 --> 00:33:43,458
Bros before hoes... and ravens.

481
00:33:43,459 --> 00:33:47,459
You're flippin' cool, Finn.
Do you know that?

482
00:33:48,899 --> 00:33:51,378
You're not going in
there on your own.

483
00:33:51,379 --> 00:33:54,138
If I go on my own,
Finn will let me get close to him.

484
00:33:54,139 --> 00:33:57,418
She's right.

485
00:33:57,419 --> 00:33:59,818
Do you know how to use this?

486
00:33:59,819 --> 00:34:02,339
Bullets come out of this end?

487
00:34:47,619 --> 00:34:49,378
Hiya, Jess.

488
00:34:49,379 --> 00:34:50,818
Can I talk to you alone?

489
00:34:50,819 --> 00:34:54,098
Yeah, course. Step into my office.

490
00:34:54,099 --> 00:34:58,099
It's not really an office.
It's... it's the bar.

491
00:35:00,419 --> 00:35:04,419
Drink?

492
00:35:05,179 --> 00:35:09,058
Uh!

493
00:35:09,059 --> 00:35:13,059
Get back. Stay back!

494
00:35:24,339 --> 00:35:27,658
Let the Holy Cross be my light.
Let not the dragon be my guide.

495
00:35:27,659 --> 00:35:31,658
Step back, impure spirit.
What you offer me is evil.

496
00:35:31,659 --> 00:35:34,378
I exorcise you in the name
of our Lord Jesus Christ.

497
00:35:34,379 --> 00:35:36,658
I free you from
the snares of the devil.

498
00:35:36,659 --> 00:35:40,659
Get thee back, Satan! Get thee back,
Satan! Get thee back, Satan!

499
00:35:47,939 --> 00:35:50,458
That's brilliant, innit?

500
00:35:50,459 --> 00:35:54,459
"Get thee back, Satan!
Get thee back, Satan!"

501
00:35:59,819 --> 00:36:02,218
Holy water?

502
00:36:02,219 --> 00:36:04,978
It's Sprite.

503
00:36:04,979 --> 00:36:08,178
This isn't you. This is me.

504
00:36:08,179 --> 00:36:11,738
I'm just improved. Version 2.0.

505
00:36:11,739 --> 00:36:14,858
Version 2.0 is a dick.
I like the original.

506
00:36:14,859 --> 00:36:18,018
Didn't want to fuck me,
though, did you? Don't.

507
00:36:18,019 --> 00:36:20,378
You'll come round.

508
00:36:20,379 --> 00:36:24,379
First I'm going to cut off Alex from
the bar's cock and feed it to him.

509
00:36:24,819 --> 00:36:27,818
Don't come any closer.
Or what? You're going to shoot me

510
00:36:27,819 --> 00:36:30,299
in my cute and monkey-ish
little face?

511
00:36:34,219 --> 00:36:37,018
Go on, then.

512
00:36:37,019 --> 00:36:39,138
Do it.

513
00:36:39,139 --> 00:36:40,778
Shoot me.

514
00:36:40,779 --> 00:36:43,379
Do it!

515
00:37:01,139 --> 00:37:03,978
I'm really sorry.

516
00:37:03,979 --> 00:37:05,898
About what?

517
00:37:05,899 --> 00:37:09,018
I'm one of them.

518
00:37:09,019 --> 00:37:13,019
Ow! What was that?

519
00:37:20,339 --> 00:37:22,258
Ooh!

520
00:37:22,259 --> 00:37:26,259
Uh. Oh.

521
00:37:26,779 --> 00:37:29,219
Oh!

522
00:38:09,539 --> 00:38:13,539
How fucking cool is that?
It is very cool.

523
00:38:13,619 --> 00:38:17,619
I'm going to call him Nigel.

524
00:38:26,179 --> 00:38:27,819
Big mistake, my friend.

525
00:38:33,939 --> 00:38:36,298
Isn't it a bit weird
that we're agents of Satan

526
00:38:36,299 --> 00:38:39,018
but we're still
on community service?

527
00:38:39,019 --> 00:38:42,338
We'll burn the probation worker
at the stake after lunch.

528
00:38:42,339 --> 00:38:46,098
There's something
I want to show you first.

529
00:38:46,099 --> 00:38:48,179
What is it?

530
00:38:53,219 --> 00:38:57,219
Let me see.

531
00:39:01,099 --> 00:39:03,019
You did all this for me?

532
00:39:05,539 --> 00:39:08,098
Just because I'm Satan's
chief agent on earth,

533
00:39:08,099 --> 00:39:12,099
doesn't mean I can't be romantic.

534
00:39:16,339 --> 00:39:20,178
I love you.

535
00:39:20,179 --> 00:39:23,498
I always have.

536
00:39:23,499 --> 00:39:27,499
And now I'm going to fuck you
and make you a bride of Satan.

537
00:39:30,779 --> 00:39:32,619
Look forward to it.

538
00:39:36,299 --> 00:39:38,498
Oh!

539
00:39:38,499 --> 00:39:40,738
Mm! Mm, mm!

540
00:39:40,739 --> 00:39:44,739
I'm doing this for you.

541
00:40:03,499 --> 00:40:05,138
It was the lung transplant.

542
00:40:05,139 --> 00:40:09,139
I've got the power to
fuck powers out of people.

543
00:40:09,259 --> 00:40:13,058
Look, I know you can't forgive me
for shagging that girl.

544
00:40:13,059 --> 00:40:14,578
And I'm not asking you to.

545
00:40:14,579 --> 00:40:17,258
And I could say that it will
never happen again, but it would.

546
00:40:17,259 --> 00:40:19,938
There's always going to
be some other girl.

547
00:40:19,939 --> 00:40:23,939
I hate myself for what I
did to you and I'm sorry.

548
00:40:27,059 --> 00:40:31,059
But now I've got the chance
to... to use my cock for good.

549
00:40:31,939 --> 00:40:35,939
And I want to save you.
I'm doing this for you.

550
00:40:36,659 --> 00:40:40,659
I'm sorry.

551
00:40:55,579 --> 00:40:57,899
Is that what I think it is?

552
00:41:05,699 --> 00:41:09,699
Sorry.

553
00:41:14,059 --> 00:41:16,018
You fucked me?
Do you think I enjoyed it?

554
00:41:16,019 --> 00:41:17,058
Probably.

555
00:41:17,059 --> 00:41:19,738
I was shagging the devil out of you.
And it was the only way.

556
00:41:19,739 --> 00:41:23,739
And I was doing it for her.

557
00:41:26,939 --> 00:41:30,939
Hiya, Jess.

558
00:41:31,219 --> 00:41:32,499
Mm.

559
00:42:01,619 --> 00:42:03,098
Ooh.

560
00:42:03,099 --> 00:42:05,618
This is for you.

561
00:42:05,619 --> 00:42:09,619
But you... Hang on.

562
00:42:10,339 --> 00:42:12,058
How kind. What... what is it?

563
00:42:12,059 --> 00:42:14,098
I knit the future.

564
00:42:14,099 --> 00:42:16,298
Ah.

565
00:42:16,299 --> 00:42:20,299
Thanks.

566
00:42:24,899 --> 00:42:28,898
So, these people here in these
orange jump suits, is that us?

567
00:42:28,899 --> 00:42:31,338
I think so.

568
00:42:31,339 --> 00:42:34,458
Are we going to become
proper superheroes?

569
00:42:34,459 --> 00:42:38,459
Ah!

570
00:42:47,579 --> 00:42:49,978
Did you get community service
for fucking him up the arse

571
00:42:49,979 --> 00:42:51,698
or breaking into
the community centre?

572
00:42:51,699 --> 00:42:53,258
Breaking and entering.

573
00:42:53,259 --> 00:42:56,298
Breaking and entering
his sphincter. Boom!

574
00:42:56,299 --> 00:42:58,498
We all know what happened!

575
00:42:58,499 --> 00:43:02,018
I think we're all mature enough to
brush it under the carpet,

576
00:43:02,019 --> 00:43:03,178
as far as it will go.

577
00:43:03,179 --> 00:43:07,179
Not just under the carpet -
under the underlay under the carpet.

578
00:43:07,699 --> 00:43:11,699
Where things go when there's
no need to speak about them

579
00:43:11,979 --> 00:43:15,979
or think about them ever again.

580
00:43:16,659 --> 00:43:19,738
So, how comes he didn't
take your telekinesis?

581
00:43:19,739 --> 00:43:22,218
I guess it's last in, first out.
Of his sphincter! Boom!

582
00:43:22,219 --> 00:43:25,218
I thought we weren't
going to talk about it?

583
00:43:25,219 --> 00:43:27,818
Sorry. Sorry.

584
00:43:27,819 --> 00:43:29,338
Eugh!

585
00:43:29,339 --> 00:43:30,538
What? I just... Shit, man.

586
00:43:30,539 --> 00:43:33,258
I don't know. I keep thinking
about you and him. It's horrid.

587
00:43:33,259 --> 00:43:36,378
Oh, for... What happened to
brushing it under the underlay

588
00:43:36,379 --> 00:43:37,538
under the carpet?

589
00:43:37,539 --> 00:43:39,058
I live in the flat below, Finn,

590
00:43:39,059 --> 00:43:41,058
and I've drilled
an hole in the ceiling.

591
00:43:41,059 --> 00:43:42,858
I can see everything, mate, every...

592
00:43:42,859 --> 00:43:44,578
Horrible.

593
00:43:44,579 --> 00:43:48,579
Like a frigging
giant shagging a dwarf.

594
00:43:49,019 --> 00:43:53,019
Boom.

595
00:44:16,259 --> 00:44:18,138
Oh, shit! It's my dad!

596
00:44:18,139 --> 00:44:20,218
Dude, your mum and dad
are proper going for it.

597
00:44:20,219 --> 00:44:21,898
That's not my mum!

598
00:44:21,899 --> 00:44:23,218
Please, don't.

599
00:44:23,219 --> 00:44:25,898
I will find you and I will hurt you.

600
00:44:25,899 --> 00:44:28,178
Mum has a right to know
what's going on here.

601
00:44:28,179 --> 00:44:30,298
I won't do it!

602
00:44:30,299 --> 00:44:34,299
So, there's this stuff going
on with our parents, and...

603
00:44:35,299 --> 00:44:37,858
..he won't let me in.
He won't listen to me.

604
00:44:37,859 --> 00:44:41,859
Why don't you just leave him
the fuck alone, yeah?

605
00:44:42,659 --> 00:44:46,659
I'm going to shank you!

606
00:44:46,899 --> 00:44:50,899
He's burning her clothes.
Why's he burning her clothes?

607
00:44:50,924 --> 00:45:33,931
