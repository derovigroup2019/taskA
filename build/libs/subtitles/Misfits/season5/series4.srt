00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:44,315
Hey, come on. Give over, you soft shite.

686
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:46,556
Come here, come on, welcome home.

687
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:48,432
(CHUCKLES)

688
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:54,475
<i>So...</i>

689
00:41:54,520 --> 00:41:57,478
about that gay guy
that you hooked me up with.

690
00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:01,993
- Oh! Yeah.
- Oh, yeah.

691
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:04,316
I just wanted to say thanks.

692
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:07,830
It felt good helping somebody.

693
00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:11,635
You know, I think this is what
I'm supposed to do with my power.

694
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:15,116
You know, be like a... a proper hero.

695
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:18,157
And all thanks to you, eh?

696
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:20,510
Yeah, pleasure.

697
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:23,439
So, hang on. Now you're into
helping people, would you?

698
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:25,391
No. I won't shag your tortoise.

699
00:42:29,560 --> 00:42:32,871
Morning, Mark. Did you sleep well?

700
00:42:45,720 --> 00:42:47,916
(WHISPERS) See you later.

701
00:42:57,040 --> 00:42:58,917
- You all right?
- Mm.

702
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:01,990
Oh!

703
00:43:03,720 --> 00:43:05,836
Is it weird that I miss him?

704
00:43:07,160 --> 00:43:09,515
It was nice having someone to look after.

705
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:14,917
No, I don't think it's weird.

706
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:22,592
Do you know what?
If I wasn't such a total fuck-up, I'd...

707
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:25,234
I'd probably ask you out for a drink
and you'd say yeah

708
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:28,875
because, well, I wouldn't be the mess
that stands before you now.

709
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:32,879
I'd <i>be...</i> I'd be someone different,
you know, someone...

710
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:35,633
...you know, someone good.

711
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:40,516
And we'd end up having
this really amazing time together and...

712
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:43,632
I dunno, we might even end up
as boyfriend and girlfriend.

713
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:46,035
(CHUCKLES)

714
00:43:46,080 --> 00:43:50,074
And it wouldn't end up with me
just fucking it up all the time

715
00:43:50,120 --> 00:43:51,872
and you thinking I'm a total cunt.

716
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:54,673
It wouldn't be like that at all.
It'd be nice.

717
00:43:57,080 --> 00:43:59,799
And we'd be happy... together

718
00:43:59,840 --> 00:44:03,674
and, I don't know, fucking hell, one day
we might even get a dog or something.

719
00:44:03,720 --> 00:44:05,438
(SHE CHUCKLES)

720
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:06,675
Huh.

721
00:44:11,640 --> 00:44:13,233
All right, then.

722
00:44:15,880 --> 00:44:17,712
All right, then, what?

723
00:44:19,720 --> 00:44:22,792
You just asked me out for a drink
and I said yes.

724
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:29,079
Yeah.

725
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:31,958
Huh.

726
00:44:34,200 --> 00:44:36,316
Sam. Sam.

727
00:44:36,360 --> 00:44:38,158
I wanna show you something.

728
00:44:45,840 --> 00:44:47,990
Is that me?

729
00:44:48,040 --> 00:44:50,919
Yeah. I think so. Huh!

730
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:53,554
And this girl down here
with the lightning bolts.

731
00:44:53,600 --> 00:44:56,479
I had an heart attack. She saved my life.

732
00:44:56,520 --> 00:44:58,830
Who's that on top of the building?

733
00:45:00,080 --> 00:45:03,436
- I don't know.
- Maybe it's you.

734
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:08,836
What if we all become superheroes?
Huh!

735
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:12,799
I mean like, you know, proper...

736
00:45:12,840 --> 00:45:14,239
superheroes.

737
00:45:18,680 --> 00:45:20,637
Maybe it's our destiny.

738
00:45:22,040 --> 00:45:24,554
<i>#...l saw you</i>

739
00:45:24,600 --> 00:45:29,276
# So cruelly you kissed me

740
00:45:29,320 --> 00:45:33,154
# Your lips a magic world

741
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:36,989
# Your sky all hung with jewels

742
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:41,079
# The killing moon

743
00:45:41,120 --> 00:45:45,478
# Will come too soon

744
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:48,876
# Fate

745
00:45:48,920 --> 00:45:51,799
# Up against your will

746
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:56,399
# You give yourself to him... #

747
00:46:12,200 --> 00:46:13,838
- (BEEP)
- I think it was my friend Lia.

748
00:46:13,880 --> 00:46:15,234
Lia?

749
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:16,918
<i>I...</i> I think she did something to me.

750
00:46:18,280 --> 00:46:20,874
- What do you do?
- Probation worker.

751
00:46:23,480 --> 00:46:25,630
I... Oh, my God.

752
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:27,876
Just don't talk to me. I'm... I'm a twat.

753
00:46:29,320 --> 00:46:30,310
I'm... I'm Lia.

754
00:46:30,360 --> 00:46:31,794
It was you, wasn't it?

755
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:35,831
Can I just? Let me just say, in my...

756
00:46:35,880 --> 00:46:38,394
- let me just say in my defence...
- Aaah!

757
00:46:38,440 --> 00:46:41,398
JESS:It's her.
She's downloaded into Alex.

758
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:42,669
Oh!

759
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:44,154
Girls, girls, girls, girls, girls!

760
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:49,752
I think he's gone.
