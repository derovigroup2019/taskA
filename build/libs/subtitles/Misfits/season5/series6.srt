1
00:00:01,842 --> 00:00:04,321
It's about a jumper.
I've seen the future.

2
00:00:04,322 --> 00:00:07,801
And I think it might be your
future. This isn't a good time.

3
00:00:07,802 --> 00:00:09,961
There's someone inside of
there? Yeah.

4
00:00:09,962 --> 00:00:11,481
His name's Mark.

5
00:00:11,482 --> 00:00:13,801
Fuck the tortoise, Alex.

6
00:00:13,802 --> 00:00:14,921
It's a no.

7
00:00:14,922 --> 00:00:18,922
If you want to be with me,
then we have to tell Finn.

8
00:00:19,602 --> 00:00:21,561
I know, but isn't there
like a middle ground,

9
00:00:21,562 --> 00:00:25,562
where we just...
where we don't tell him?

10
00:00:53,882 --> 00:00:57,081
It's a support group
for terminally ill young people.

11
00:00:57,082 --> 00:00:58,921
I'm one of their care assistants.

12
00:00:58,922 --> 00:01:02,161
Hang on. Terminally... ill?

13
00:01:02,162 --> 00:01:03,921
So, they're dying?

14
00:01:03,922 --> 00:01:05,121
No, no, no, no, no, no.

15
00:01:05,122 --> 00:01:07,001
As in the other kind
of terminally ill,

16
00:01:07,002 --> 00:01:08,921
where people live
happily ever after.

17
00:01:08,922 --> 00:01:10,121
Twat.

18
00:01:10,122 --> 00:01:13,561
We just try and make
their last few months here...
Makes you think, doesn't it?

19
00:01:13,562 --> 00:01:15,841
- Oh, mate.
- About what?

20
00:01:15,842 --> 00:01:18,441
Lunch. Mm.

21
00:01:18,442 --> 00:01:21,601
Whether or not to have
pizza or kebab.

22
00:01:21,602 --> 00:01:24,601
We just thought that you might like
to spend some time with them and...

23
00:01:24,602 --> 00:01:26,561
Um... right, OK, here we go.

24
00:01:26,562 --> 00:01:30,441
You're going to die, and it's your
last supper. What will you choose?

25
00:01:30,442 --> 00:01:31,801
- Ooh.
- Easy.

26
00:01:31,802 --> 00:01:33,321
- Go on.
Uh-huh?

27
00:01:33,322 --> 00:01:35,721
All-you-can-eat buffet.
Ah, that's very nice.

28
00:01:35,722 --> 00:01:37,201
Italian.

29
00:01:37,202 --> 00:01:41,202
Chinese, Mexican, Indian, Jamaican.

30
00:01:41,322 --> 00:01:44,121
Big fuck-off plates, just, "Up
yours, Grim Reaper."

31
00:01:44,122 --> 00:01:45,321
I'd go up for seconds.

32
00:01:45,322 --> 00:01:47,361
Do you know what?
Are you doing them a buffet?

33
00:01:47,362 --> 00:01:51,362
Yeah, do them a buff...

34
00:01:51,442 --> 00:01:54,241
Where did she go?

35
00:01:54,242 --> 00:01:57,001
I don't know,
but that is really rude.

36
00:01:57,002 --> 00:01:59,841
We should probably go in
before they start dying.

37
00:01:59,842 --> 00:02:01,321
Yeah.

38
00:02:01,322 --> 00:02:03,601
What's going on? You all right?

39
00:02:03,602 --> 00:02:05,315
Obviously not, like.

40
00:03:02,042 --> 00:03:03,081
Checkmate.

41
00:03:03,082 --> 00:03:07,082
You twat!

42
00:03:07,722 --> 00:03:10,601
You've got...
you've got to laugh, haven't you?

43
00:03:10,602 --> 00:03:13,561
Laugh in the face of death.

44
00:03:13,562 --> 00:03:16,201
Cos death's a prick.

45
00:03:16,202 --> 00:03:19,561
Prick.

46
00:03:19,562 --> 00:03:23,562
Another match? Mm-hm.

47
00:03:25,802 --> 00:03:26,921
Skin cancer.

48
00:03:26,922 --> 00:03:28,241
Oh? Oh. Oh.

49
00:03:28,242 --> 00:03:31,201
You want to know what's killing me,
but you don't want to ask.

50
00:03:31,202 --> 00:03:32,521
Mm-hm.

51
00:03:32,522 --> 00:03:35,841
How long have you known about it?
I mean...

52
00:03:35,842 --> 00:03:37,841
Erm... around 18 months.

53
00:03:37,842 --> 00:03:41,842
The doctors kept telling me, um...
they can operate. They can treat it.

54
00:03:42,282 --> 00:03:44,081
And then one day, they turn around

55
00:03:44,082 --> 00:03:48,082
and they're like, "Well, actually,
Lucas, you're fucking gonna die."

56
00:03:49,962 --> 00:03:53,321
All these fucking doctors,
man, they're just full of shit.

57
00:03:53,322 --> 00:03:55,561
Jesus Christ, man.
Honest to God, it just...

58
00:03:55,562 --> 00:03:57,241
Fucking hell, it sucks cock.

59
00:03:57,242 --> 00:03:59,961
It really does, man.
I'm so sorry for you. I...

60
00:03:59,962 --> 00:04:02,681
It's like I can feel the life
being drained out of me,

61
00:04:02,682 --> 00:04:04,561
and I've got these counsellors

62
00:04:04,562 --> 00:04:07,481
telling me that I should just
accept it. Mm. Fuck them.

63
00:04:07,482 --> 00:04:10,601
I...I don't deserve this. I should
be out with mates, getting...

64
00:04:10,602 --> 00:04:12,681
getting drunk
and fucking girls and...

65
00:04:12,682 --> 00:04:15,561
I feel your pain, man. Oh!

66
00:04:15,562 --> 00:04:17,841
Jesus Christ! Yeah!

67
00:04:17,842 --> 00:04:21,041
That... Decafecate!

68
00:04:21,042 --> 00:04:24,361
Er... that's not a word.
Fucking IS a word.

69
00:04:24,362 --> 00:04:28,281
"Decafecate" to evacuate
one's bowels after a triple espresso.

70
00:04:28,282 --> 00:04:32,201
I decafecated just this morning
in Starbucks, all over.

71
00:04:32,202 --> 00:04:34,481
Yeah, well, I'm looking it up.
Well, do look it up, man.

72
00:04:34,482 --> 00:04:36,081
It's on YouTube.

73
00:04:36,082 --> 00:04:38,561
Video's got 30,000 hits and counting.

74
00:04:38,562 --> 00:04:42,562
Can I get some?

75
00:04:47,882 --> 00:04:50,801
Yeah. Mm-hm.

76
00:04:50,802 --> 00:04:54,802
Where are you going?

77
00:04:55,402 --> 00:04:56,561
To church.

78
00:04:56,562 --> 00:04:58,161
Now? Yes.

79
00:04:58,162 --> 00:05:02,162
Yes, now, because I'll tell you why,
Finlay, because the Lord...

80
00:05:03,362 --> 00:05:05,241
he giveth, don't he?

81
00:05:05,242 --> 00:05:08,401
And then, well, he taketh away,
taketh away what he's giveth,

82
00:05:08,402 --> 00:05:12,282
and I'm off to fucking church
to getteth it back.

83
00:05:25,962 --> 00:05:29,121
Oh, shit.

84
00:05:29,122 --> 00:05:30,642
Oh, shit.

85
00:05:41,922 --> 00:05:44,681
What? Er... nothing, nothing.

86
00:05:44,682 --> 00:05:45,721
What's going on?

87
00:05:45,722 --> 00:05:47,561
Er... just... I'm
just... I'm teasing you.

88
00:05:47,562 --> 00:05:49,801
Driving you sexually wild,
eh, aren't I?

89
00:05:49,802 --> 00:05:52,241
There's my penis, gone!
Sorry. Denied!

90
00:05:52,242 --> 00:05:55,161
I'm not really sure
it's doing it for me, so...

91
00:05:55,162 --> 00:05:57,161
You are just consumed with lust.

92
00:05:57,162 --> 00:06:01,162
Ah, you're beautiful. Jesus Christ.

93
00:06:01,442 --> 00:06:03,361
Fucking bastard.

94
00:06:03,362 --> 00:06:06,801
What the frigging hell
are you playing at, eh?

95
00:06:06,802 --> 00:06:08,761
Dude, I am... I'm talking to you!

96
00:06:08,762 --> 00:06:11,841
You're fucking hanging there,
as soft as an overripe peach.

97
00:06:11,842 --> 00:06:14,401
God, just... I have no idea
what this is all about, dude,

98
00:06:14,402 --> 00:06:16,121
but you got to sort yourself out,

99
00:06:16,122 --> 00:06:20,122
or me and you are going to have
a fucking really serious falling out!

100
00:06:20,482 --> 00:06:23,921
Christ sake! Look at you.

101
00:06:23,922 --> 00:06:27,922
Dick.

102
00:06:31,682 --> 00:06:35,682
All right, mate? You all right?

103
00:06:36,602 --> 00:06:40,602
All right?

104
00:06:45,242 --> 00:06:46,401
It's medicinal.

105
00:06:46,402 --> 00:06:50,402
Special Brew?

106
00:06:53,202 --> 00:06:56,201
I thought you had lung cancer.

107
00:06:56,202 --> 00:06:59,761
Ah. All right, look,
you can't tell anyone.

108
00:06:59,762 --> 00:07:02,721
I've got a good thing going here,
yeah?

109
00:07:02,722 --> 00:07:04,441
I'm not really dying.

110
00:07:04,442 --> 00:07:08,321
I'm faking it.

111
00:07:08,322 --> 00:07:11,241
Why would you do that?

112
00:07:11,242 --> 00:07:12,681
For the pussy.

113
00:07:12,682 --> 00:07:14,561
Seriously?

114
00:07:14,562 --> 00:07:17,201
Yeah. Shave your hair off.

115
00:07:17,202 --> 00:07:19,841
Lay on some big sob story
about how scared you are.

116
00:07:19,842 --> 00:07:21,201
"I just want to live."

117
00:07:21,202 --> 00:07:22,921
And their knickers
are hitting the floor

118
00:07:22,922 --> 00:07:25,282
faster than you can say,
"Six rounds of chemotherapy."

119
00:07:27,682 --> 00:07:31,682
I'm telling you, mate, it's like
the mother of all charity fucks.

120
00:07:33,762 --> 00:07:37,762
Tell me everything.

121
00:07:44,722 --> 00:07:46,881
Here he is,
this guy with his new jeans.

122
00:07:46,882 --> 00:07:48,721
They fit in all the right places.

123
00:07:48,722 --> 00:07:50,881
Yeah, cheers, mate.
I thought I'd treat myself.

124
00:07:50,882 --> 00:07:52,521
My nana gave us 200 quid.

125
00:07:52,522 --> 00:07:54,041
Really? Uh-huh.

126
00:07:54,042 --> 00:07:55,721
Good old Nana. Yeah.

127
00:07:55,722 --> 00:07:58,881
200 quid.

128
00:07:58,882 --> 00:08:01,561
Can you lend me 20 quid?
It's just that I'm absolutely skint.

129
00:08:01,562 --> 00:08:04,841
Mate, I'd love to, but I can't.

130
00:08:04,842 --> 00:08:07,481
You've just said
your nan gave you 200 quid.

131
00:08:07,482 --> 00:08:09,321
Sorry, mate.

132
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:13,322
What I meant was I'd...
I'd love to help you, but I won't.

133
00:08:15,682 --> 00:08:18,681
Thanks. Thanks, mate.
Not a problem.

134
00:08:18,682 --> 00:08:22,682
No? You prick.

135
00:08:22,882 --> 00:08:24,521
Ab? Yeah.

136
00:08:24,522 --> 00:08:27,561
Fancy buying me a drink?
Oh, no, I can't.

137
00:08:27,562 --> 00:08:30,721
Me and Mark are going
to the cinema. Aren't we, mate?

138
00:08:30,722 --> 00:08:33,161
He's a big Tom Hanks fan, this one.

139
00:08:33,162 --> 00:08:37,162
See you. OK, yeah.

140
00:08:41,042 --> 00:08:45,042
Oh, shit.

141
00:08:47,002 --> 00:08:48,322
You all right there?

142
00:08:50,722 --> 00:08:53,281
I dropped my keys in the lake.

143
00:08:53,282 --> 00:08:54,921
I know you, don't I?

144
00:08:54,922 --> 00:08:57,441
I come in the bar sometimes.

145
00:08:57,442 --> 00:09:01,161
We live in the same block.
You've come on to me twice.

146
00:09:01,162 --> 00:09:02,801
Have we...

147
00:09:02,802 --> 00:09:04,961
No. I knocked you back both times.

148
00:09:04,962 --> 00:09:07,481
Really? Wow. Look.

149
00:09:07,482 --> 00:09:10,041
You couldn't do me a huge favour
and go in there

150
00:09:10,042 --> 00:09:11,321
and get my keys for me?

151
00:09:11,322 --> 00:09:14,761
You go in there and get them.

152
00:09:14,762 --> 00:09:18,762
I'm terrified of water. I... I know
it's ridiculous. I've got a phobia.

153
00:09:19,162 --> 00:09:23,161
Do you know what? I'd love to help
you, but... new jeans.

154
00:09:23,162 --> 00:09:26,401
Please. I can't go in there.
I can't swim.

155
00:09:26,402 --> 00:09:30,402
You'll be fine.
It's like two feet deep.

156
00:09:32,282 --> 00:09:36,282
Well, thanks for nothing.
It's not my problem.

157
00:09:54,642 --> 00:09:56,121
You OK?

158
00:09:56,122 --> 00:09:58,641
It's not fucking fair.

159
00:09:58,642 --> 00:10:01,361
What?

160
00:10:01,362 --> 00:10:04,361
Oh, right, yeah.

161
00:10:04,362 --> 00:10:07,041
Yeah, so... so unfair.

162
00:10:07,042 --> 00:10:08,601
What can you do?

163
00:10:08,602 --> 00:10:12,602
What if you didn't have to accept it,
didn't have to die?

164
00:10:13,962 --> 00:10:15,841
What if there was something
you could do?

165
00:10:15,842 --> 00:10:18,121
Well, you'd have to do it.

166
00:10:18,122 --> 00:10:20,241
Whatever it took.

167
00:10:20,242 --> 00:10:24,081
You owe it to yourself.

168
00:10:24,082 --> 00:10:26,641
Anyway.

169
00:10:26,642 --> 00:10:27,921
Wait.

170
00:10:27,922 --> 00:10:30,761
What?

171
00:10:30,762 --> 00:10:32,562
Will you hold me?

172
00:10:34,282 --> 00:10:36,081
Me?

173
00:10:36,082 --> 00:10:38,121
Really?

174
00:10:38,122 --> 00:10:42,122
Oh, yeah. Sure... sure,
I can... I can do that.

175
00:10:43,722 --> 00:10:47,722
You feel so alive.

176
00:11:03,842 --> 00:11:05,921
You look like you're feeling better.

177
00:11:05,922 --> 00:11:08,041
Sorry? What was that?

178
00:11:08,042 --> 00:11:11,081
You look better.

179
00:11:11,082 --> 00:11:15,082
Oh, erm... yeah.
It, erm... it comes and goes.

180
00:11:25,402 --> 00:11:26,761
I try and stay strong.

181
00:11:26,762 --> 00:11:28,921
Yeah. I do, but it's hard.

182
00:11:28,922 --> 00:11:31,841
It's just hard when you know
you haven't got much time.

183
00:11:31,842 --> 00:11:33,721
Yeah.

184
00:11:33,722 --> 00:11:36,281
But, I mean, I hope
you don't mind me asking,

185
00:11:36,282 --> 00:11:39,161
but what is it you're dying of?

186
00:11:39,162 --> 00:11:41,161
AIDS.

187
00:11:41,162 --> 00:11:43,481
No, no, not...

188
00:11:43,482 --> 00:11:45,561
Ahem! Not AIDS AIDS.

189
00:11:45,562 --> 00:11:47,521
It's like HI...

190
00:11:47,522 --> 00:11:49,801
Cancer.

191
00:11:49,802 --> 00:11:52,322
Nothing that you catch
by having sex with me.

192
00:12:01,282 --> 00:12:03,001
Just wanted to let you know...

193
00:12:03,002 --> 00:12:05,241
found my keys.

194
00:12:05,242 --> 00:12:07,041
Oh, right. Nice one.

195
00:12:07,042 --> 00:12:09,241
I was in there.

196
00:12:09,242 --> 00:12:13,041
I fell over. I nearly drowned.

197
00:12:13,042 --> 00:12:17,042
Do you know what it's like,
choking on foul, shitty water?

198
00:12:18,082 --> 00:12:20,521
And this is all my fault
how exactly?

199
00:12:20,522 --> 00:12:22,961
You should have helped me.

200
00:12:22,962 --> 00:12:24,801
New jeans?

201
00:12:24,802 --> 00:12:27,801
All right. Don't make me out to be
the bad guy. I didn't do anything.

202
00:12:27,802 --> 00:12:30,201
That's right. You didn't do anything.

203
00:12:30,202 --> 00:12:34,202
Well, there's no law that says
you have to help people.

204
00:12:37,762 --> 00:12:40,761
What?

205
00:12:40,762 --> 00:12:43,962
I put a Gypsy curse on you.

206
00:12:45,602 --> 00:12:48,361
Right, yeah. Course you did.

207
00:12:48,362 --> 00:12:52,362
Look, the very least that you can do
is help me out and drive me home.

208
00:12:52,442 --> 00:12:54,682
I'm working, so...

209
00:13:13,242 --> 00:13:15,921
Every time you refuse
to help someone,

210
00:13:15,922 --> 00:13:18,082
any time you don't do
the right thing...

211
00:13:20,515 --> 00:13:23,595
..you're gonna feel like you're
drowning. Don't, don't do...

212
00:13:24,073 --> 00:13:26,915
There's no law that says
you have to help people.

213
00:13:53,881 --> 00:13:57,881
And the bitch has put
a Gypsy curse on me.

214
00:13:58,037 --> 00:14:02,037
Makes me feel like I'm
drowning. It's fucking horrible.

215
00:14:02,546 --> 00:14:04,985
So you're compelled to help people?
Yeah.

216
00:14:04,986 --> 00:14:07,385
You couldn't lend us 20 quid,
could you, mate?

217
00:14:07,386 --> 00:14:11,386
You know, just... just help me
out?

218
00:14:13,146 --> 00:14:16,386
You little bastard.
Mm.

219
00:14:18,866 --> 00:14:20,345
That's really mean.

220
00:14:20,346 --> 00:14:24,346
You call it mean.
I... I call it karma.

221
00:14:25,106 --> 00:14:26,985
Oh...
Fuck.

222
00:14:26,986 --> 00:14:28,745
Fuck.

223
00:14:28,746 --> 00:14:32,746
Let's make it 30, shall we?

224
00:14:41,026 --> 00:14:45,026
Come on.

225
00:14:46,226 --> 00:14:48,465
For fuck's sake!

226
00:14:48,466 --> 00:14:50,025
Son of a bitch!
What's going on?

227
00:14:50,026 --> 00:14:53,385
One sec. I'll be with you, two
shakes of a bee's knee. You bastard.

228
00:14:53,386 --> 00:14:54,945
Come on. Rudy?

229
00:14:54,946 --> 00:14:58,946
Oh, for fuck's sake.

230
00:15:02,306 --> 00:15:06,306
I don't know what's going on
with him.

231
00:15:06,866 --> 00:15:07,905
Is it me? No!

232
00:15:07,906 --> 00:15:10,865
It's not you. It isn't you.
It's fucking him.

233
00:15:10,866 --> 00:15:14,866
And I've... I warned you. I said this would
happen, and now this is happening!

234
00:15:15,506 --> 00:15:16,905
Ah!

235
00:15:16,906 --> 00:15:18,746
Fucking hell, dude!

236
00:15:21,586 --> 00:15:25,586
Honestly, I was about to be on the
happy end of a very nice charity fuck,

237
00:15:26,826 --> 00:15:30,385
thank you very much.

238
00:15:30,386 --> 00:15:33,865
AIDS.

239
00:15:33,866 --> 00:15:37,866
I tell you what,
it's a proper passion killer.

240
00:15:41,306 --> 00:15:45,306
Your move.

241
00:15:48,386 --> 00:15:50,945
Mm.

242
00:15:50,946 --> 00:15:53,705
Checkmate! Yes!

243
00:15:53,706 --> 00:15:56,465
Fuck you, you fucking loser!

244
00:15:56,466 --> 00:15:59,585
Hm.

245
00:15:59,586 --> 00:16:01,425
It's a coping mechanism.
It's humour.

246
00:16:01,426 --> 00:16:05,426
All part of the process.

247
00:16:08,506 --> 00:16:11,825
Are you OK?

248
00:16:11,826 --> 00:16:15,826
It's so weird.

249
00:16:16,826 --> 00:16:20,826
It's like I don't have
the will to live any more.

250
00:16:21,786 --> 00:16:23,145
It's gone.

251
00:16:23,146 --> 00:16:27,145
Yeah.

252
00:16:27,146 --> 00:16:30,825
Very nice.

253
00:16:30,826 --> 00:16:34,826
Very convincing.

254
00:16:38,626 --> 00:16:40,385
Has it happened before?

255
00:16:40,386 --> 00:16:43,345
No.

256
00:16:43,346 --> 00:16:47,346
No? Once. It's happened
once before.

257
00:16:47,826 --> 00:16:48,865
I was shagging a doctor.

258
00:16:48,866 --> 00:16:52,385
Well... well, by doctor, I mean
the receptionist at the vet's.

259
00:16:52,386 --> 00:16:54,625
And so I bend her over the
table in the treatment room

260
00:16:54,626 --> 00:16:58,305
and I've got fucking Peter staring at
me with his sad, dead eyes. So...

261
00:16:58,306 --> 00:17:00,185
Who's Peter?
Was that the vet?

262
00:17:00,186 --> 00:17:04,105
No, he was my bunny, Peter the
rabbit. I was having him put down.

263
00:17:04,106 --> 00:17:06,425
Oh.
And, honest to God, I abso...

264
00:17:06,426 --> 00:17:09,465
Fucking hell, I loved that rabbit. He
had these massive big floppy ears.

265
00:17:09,466 --> 00:17:12,265
They felt like... honestly, it was
like furry velvet on your skin.

266
00:17:12,266 --> 00:17:14,905
So, you have him put down and
you slip it up the receptionist?

267
00:17:14,906 --> 00:17:17,425
No, no, no, no, I couldn't slip it up
the receptionist,

268
00:17:17,426 --> 00:17:21,025
because I was filled with this sort
of... I don't know, like a bloody...

269
00:17:21,026 --> 00:17:24,625
overwhelming sense of love
for Peter the rabbit.

270
00:17:24,626 --> 00:17:27,745
My dick was... honestly, as soft,
floppy and as velvety

271
00:17:27,746 --> 00:17:29,585
as his frigging ears.

272
00:17:29,586 --> 00:17:31,865
It was a nightmare.

273
00:17:31,866 --> 00:17:33,425
Mm.

274
00:17:33,426 --> 00:17:37,426
Honestly.

275
00:17:38,866 --> 00:17:40,905
That's what it... that's what
it is.

276
00:17:40,906 --> 00:17:44,906
Fuck me. That's what... that's what
it is. It's because I love you.

277
00:17:48,266 --> 00:17:49,305
You love me? Yeah.

278
00:17:49,306 --> 00:17:50,985
I love you like
I loved Peter Rabbit.

279
00:17:50,986 --> 00:17:53,465
And that's why
my cock won't frigging work.

280
00:17:53,466 --> 00:17:56,665
I have a really sarcastic penis.

281
00:17:56,666 --> 00:18:00,666
Do you mean you have an ironic
penis? Is that what you mean?

282
00:18:00,866 --> 00:18:03,145
What you on about? The bend in it?

283
00:18:03,146 --> 00:18:05,825
That's from when Saunders
slammed it into a door.

284
00:18:05,826 --> 00:18:09,826
Mad bastard.

285
00:18:15,786 --> 00:18:16,986
For fuck's sake.

286
00:18:28,506 --> 00:18:29,545
Hiya.

287
00:18:29,546 --> 00:18:32,665
Ah!
Oof!

288
00:18:32,666 --> 00:18:34,746
Jesus! What were you doing?

289
00:18:35,866 --> 00:18:37,145
There was...

290
00:18:37,146 --> 00:18:39,865
There's been a lot of muggings.
I thought you were attacking me.

291
00:18:39,866 --> 00:18:43,105
It's all right. No harm done.

292
00:18:43,106 --> 00:18:47,105
Wow.

293
00:18:47,106 --> 00:18:51,106
What are you doing here?

294
00:18:52,466 --> 00:18:55,425
I came to see you.

295
00:18:55,426 --> 00:18:57,785
I like you.

296
00:18:57,786 --> 00:19:01,025
I...I don't care
if you don't like me.

297
00:19:01,026 --> 00:19:03,265
Well, I do. Of course I do.

298
00:19:03,266 --> 00:19:06,065
But it's not going to stop me
liking you.

299
00:19:06,066 --> 00:19:09,105
You're smiling.

300
00:19:09,106 --> 00:19:11,905
I've never seen you smile before.

301
00:19:11,906 --> 00:19:15,906
I smile. Not very often.

302
00:19:16,586 --> 00:19:19,185
Why is that?

303
00:19:19,186 --> 00:19:23,186
Well, sometimes it feels like
there's not very much to smile about.

304
00:19:25,866 --> 00:19:29,866
Yeah.

305
00:19:29,906 --> 00:19:32,705
I have... thought about you.

306
00:19:32,706 --> 00:19:34,465
Have you?

307
00:19:34,466 --> 00:19:36,665
Yeah.

308
00:19:36,666 --> 00:19:40,465
Ha.

309
00:19:40,466 --> 00:19:42,415
What?

310
00:21:31,001 --> 00:21:35,001
In some small way...
we are all responsible.

311
00:21:36,461 --> 00:21:39,841
I want each of us to take
a moment to reflect

312
00:21:39,913 --> 00:21:43,913
on how we failed to prevent
the tragic death of that very...

313
00:21:45,033 --> 00:21:49,033
attractive young man.

314
00:21:52,553 --> 00:21:56,072
Finlay was playing chess with him.

315
00:21:56,073 --> 00:21:57,672
Weren't you?

316
00:21:57,673 --> 00:21:59,112
Yeah.

317
00:21:59,113 --> 00:22:01,152
What was the last thing
you said to him?

318
00:22:01,153 --> 00:22:03,352
Probably something kind.

319
00:22:03,353 --> 00:22:06,112
No, you said...

320
00:22:06,113 --> 00:22:08,232
"Fuck you, you fucking loser."

321
00:22:08,233 --> 00:22:12,233
Oh. Yeah.

322
00:22:15,113 --> 00:22:17,352
Yeah, I did. I said that,
because I was joking.

323
00:22:17,353 --> 00:22:21,353
That beautiful young man's
blood is on your hands.

324
00:22:24,673 --> 00:22:28,673
You need to ask God
for forgiveness.

325
00:22:28,993 --> 00:22:32,993
Seriously?

326
00:22:40,033 --> 00:22:43,993
Pray.

327
00:22:50,873 --> 00:22:54,873
I just hope you can find
a way to live with yourself.

328
00:23:02,313 --> 00:23:03,952
We need to...

329
00:23:03,953 --> 00:23:06,672
Hey! Hey!

330
00:23:06,673 --> 00:23:08,913
You're going to take
this fucking curse off!

331
00:23:17,393 --> 00:23:20,432
All right.

332
00:23:20,433 --> 00:23:24,433
I get it. I'm sorry. I should have
helped you find your keys.

333
00:23:24,993 --> 00:23:28,912
You've made your point.

334
00:23:28,913 --> 00:23:31,752
Oh...

335
00:23:31,753 --> 00:23:35,072
A guy killed himself in front
of me today,

336
00:23:35,073 --> 00:23:37,832
and I didn't help him, cos I didn't
know what he was going to do.

337
00:23:37,833 --> 00:23:40,472
And now I feel so shit about it.

338
00:23:40,473 --> 00:23:43,432
I should have done something.

339
00:23:43,433 --> 00:23:47,433
I get it, all right?

340
00:23:47,993 --> 00:23:49,072
I get it!

341
00:23:49,073 --> 00:23:53,073
What do you want from me?

342
00:24:01,233 --> 00:24:05,032
Phew.

343
00:24:05,033 --> 00:24:08,192
Ha. Is this how you usually
spend your afternoons?

344
00:24:08,193 --> 00:24:10,352
I think you're confusing me
with a prostitute.

345
00:24:10,353 --> 00:24:14,353
Oh, no, I... I wasn't.
I wasn't calling you a slut.
Cos you're not. You're just...

346
00:24:15,313 --> 00:24:16,592
Hm.

347
00:24:16,593 --> 00:24:20,593
I usually spend my afternoons
changing fuses and rewiring houses.

348
00:24:21,633 --> 00:24:24,952
So, this has been a good day.

349
00:24:24,953 --> 00:24:28,953
Yeah, it has been a good day.

350
00:24:29,073 --> 00:24:31,112
Listen, about the jumper
and the superhero...

351
00:24:31,113 --> 00:24:33,352
Oh, stop talking!
It's very... it's very important!

352
00:24:33,353 --> 00:24:37,353
Shut up!

353
00:24:55,313 --> 00:24:57,152
Leukaemia?

354
00:24:57,153 --> 00:24:59,112
That's shit, mate.

355
00:24:59,113 --> 00:25:03,112
How does... how does that go
down with the ladies?

356
00:25:03,113 --> 00:25:07,113
You're sick.

357
00:25:15,753 --> 00:25:19,472
Um... will you give me a tour
of the Community Centre?

358
00:25:19,473 --> 00:25:22,472
Why do you need me?
Just fill your boots, man.

359
00:25:22,473 --> 00:25:25,432
Oh, well, to be honest, I just
wanted to hang out with you.

360
00:25:25,433 --> 00:25:29,433
I mean, you seem like a really
cool guy.

361
00:25:32,193 --> 00:25:34,832
Yes, I am. Yes!

362
00:25:34,833 --> 00:25:38,833
Come on, you.

363
00:25:41,313 --> 00:25:44,832
This is where the magic happens,
if your idea of magic is

364
00:25:44,833 --> 00:25:46,512
people getting dressed.

365
00:25:46,513 --> 00:25:50,513
Oh, that's my locker.

366
00:25:53,593 --> 00:25:56,352
The vending machine.

367
00:25:56,353 --> 00:25:59,872
Nature's gift.

368
00:25:59,873 --> 00:26:02,312
A corridor,

369
00:26:02,313 --> 00:26:06,313
useful for getting to the storeroom.

370
00:26:09,273 --> 00:26:13,032
The storeroom.

371
00:26:13,033 --> 00:26:14,832
Where...

372
00:26:14,833 --> 00:26:18,833
we like to store things.

373
00:26:20,073 --> 00:26:21,112
You all right?

374
00:26:21,113 --> 00:26:23,152
Will you hold me?

375
00:26:23,153 --> 00:26:24,912
Fuck off.

376
00:26:24,913 --> 00:26:28,913
Please. Just... just hold me.

377
00:26:30,993 --> 00:26:34,993
If this is some kind of gay trick, I don't
care if you're dying, I will... I'll...

378
00:26:35,793 --> 00:26:38,552
I'll take a very dim view of it.

379
00:26:38,553 --> 00:26:39,592
Look, I'm not gay, OK?

380
00:26:39,593 --> 00:26:43,512
It's just... holding someone,
it...

381
00:26:43,513 --> 00:26:46,392
..it makes me feel alive.

382
00:26:46,393 --> 00:26:49,312
You know?

383
00:26:49,313 --> 00:26:51,832
OK. Yeah.

384
00:26:51,833 --> 00:26:54,872
I'm warning you...

385
00:26:54,873 --> 00:26:57,352
There you go.

386
00:26:57,353 --> 00:27:00,793
All better.

387
00:27:30,833 --> 00:27:33,712
Alex?

388
00:27:33,713 --> 00:27:36,152
What?
Are you taking a shit?

389
00:27:36,153 --> 00:27:37,312
No.

390
00:27:37,313 --> 00:27:39,712
Are you having a wank?

391
00:27:39,713 --> 00:27:42,432
No. OK.

392
00:27:42,433 --> 00:27:45,152
So... I've been thinking.

393
00:27:45,153 --> 00:27:48,552
You're going to make me
fuck your turtle, aren't you?

394
00:27:48,553 --> 00:27:50,592
You... bitch.

395
00:27:50,593 --> 00:27:53,072
I don't want to take advantage
of your situation.

396
00:27:53,073 --> 00:27:57,647
Yes, you do. Yes, you do, because
you know that I can't say no.

397
00:27:57,833 --> 00:27:59,752
You're going
to make me fuck your turtle.

398
00:27:59,753 --> 00:28:03,312
Well, it's the only way that we can
be together as man and woman,

399
00:28:03,313 --> 00:28:07,313
rather than woman and turtle,
which is... It's just too weird.

400
00:28:16,353 --> 00:28:19,792
If I fuck him to death,
it isn't on me.

401
00:28:19,793 --> 00:28:23,793
Maybe you could just come
on his shell.

402
00:28:23,873 --> 00:28:25,872
It doesn't work like that.

403
00:28:25,873 --> 00:28:27,232
I wish it did.

404
00:28:27,233 --> 00:28:30,432
Just be tender and gentle.
Try not to hurt him.

405
00:28:30,433 --> 00:28:34,433
I'm ramming my cock up a turtle's arse,
and you don't want me to hurt him?

406
00:28:36,713 --> 00:28:40,713
Maybe you could just
get him drunk first or...

407
00:29:04,433 --> 00:29:08,433
Hiya. Hiya.

408
00:29:28,513 --> 00:29:29,952
I love you, man.

409
00:29:29,953 --> 00:29:32,952
Hm?

410
00:29:32,953 --> 00:29:36,953
Yeah, I appreciate it.

411
00:29:52,153 --> 00:29:54,792
Oh!

412
00:29:54,793 --> 00:29:58,793
It's a sex bag. Ha. You expect me
to wear that?

413
00:29:59,073 --> 00:30:03,073
What, seriously?

414
00:30:21,073 --> 00:30:25,073
Come on.

415
00:31:03,833 --> 00:31:07,833
Go and get help! Get Abby!

416
00:31:09,633 --> 00:31:11,352
Abby!

417
00:31:11,353 --> 00:31:13,552
Let me die.

418
00:31:13,553 --> 00:31:17,553
I'm not going to let you die,
you little shit.

419
00:31:18,513 --> 00:31:19,991
Please!

420
00:31:51,770 --> 00:31:54,609
Did he say anything to you?

421
00:31:54,610 --> 00:31:58,610
No, nothing. Not a dickybird.

422
00:31:58,730 --> 00:32:02,730
Something must have really
upset him.

423
00:32:02,770 --> 00:32:04,409
Oh, shit.

424
00:32:04,410 --> 00:32:06,489
I don't want to even say it.

425
00:32:06,490 --> 00:32:09,889
What? Well, do you think he's found out
about me and you and all the shagging...

426
00:32:09,890 --> 00:32:12,129
Shh! He already knows.

427
00:32:12,130 --> 00:32:14,649
Oh, I know about his soft cock
and everything.

428
00:32:14,650 --> 00:32:16,169
You with him?

429
00:32:16,170 --> 00:32:19,569
Er... no, don't look at me like that,
cos you're in love with a turtle, so...

430
00:32:19,570 --> 00:32:23,570
Fair point. Sorry about
the soft cock. Thanks, Ab.

431
00:32:23,850 --> 00:32:27,729
Can we just get back to Finn? Why do you
think he might have found out about us?

432
00:32:27,730 --> 00:32:31,329
So, I'm sat in there on the couch.
I'm drawing a smiley face on a bag.

433
00:32:31,330 --> 00:32:33,889
Little man stands
in the doorway,

434
00:32:33,890 --> 00:32:36,809
fixes me with this look,
"I love you, man."

435
00:32:36,810 --> 00:32:40,329
Right, now, was he saying,
"I love you, man,

436
00:32:40,330 --> 00:32:42,369
"but you have stabbed me in my back,

437
00:32:42,370 --> 00:32:44,609
"and you've gone and shat in my
mouth"?

438
00:32:44,610 --> 00:32:47,729
I was like, "No, no! I'm sorry.
Me and my big floppy cock, we're sorry."

439
00:32:47,730 --> 00:32:51,730
"Well, it's too late
for fucking sorry, arsehole!"

440
00:32:53,890 --> 00:32:57,890
Stop it. Sorry.

441
00:32:59,610 --> 00:33:01,009
Sam.

442
00:33:01,010 --> 00:33:03,089
I made love to her.

443
00:33:03,090 --> 00:33:04,209
You all right?

444
00:33:04,210 --> 00:33:05,689
Maggie?

445
00:33:05,690 --> 00:33:08,049
No! Helen.

446
00:33:08,050 --> 00:33:10,409
Electro girl from the jumper.
Sweet.

447
00:33:10,410 --> 00:33:13,049
Yeah.
Did she shock your balls?

448
00:33:13,050 --> 00:33:14,809
Why would she shock my balls?

449
00:33:14,810 --> 00:33:17,249
I don't know.
Maybe she's into kinky stuff.

450
00:33:17,250 --> 00:33:21,209
What's the matter with you? No,
she's not kinky. She's lovely.

451
00:33:21,210 --> 00:33:25,210
We'd better sit down.

452
00:33:30,090 --> 00:33:31,529
I've got something for you.

453
00:33:31,530 --> 00:33:34,529
Yeah?

454
00:33:34,530 --> 00:33:38,289
But this... this has already
happened.

455
00:33:38,290 --> 00:33:41,009
I started it last week.
I meant to give it to you then.

456
00:33:41,010 --> 00:33:42,809
It took me a while to finish it.

457
00:33:42,810 --> 00:33:46,810
What, so now you knit the past?
Only when my arthritis is playing up.

458
00:33:47,650 --> 00:33:49,649
You see me and Helen
on this jumper?

459
00:33:49,650 --> 00:33:52,729
This is proof, isn't it? This is
proof that it comes true.

460
00:33:52,730 --> 00:33:56,249
You can't fight destiny, you can't.

461
00:33:56,250 --> 00:33:59,369
Electro girl, is she up for
the whole superhero thing?

462
00:33:59,370 --> 00:34:02,009
No. No, not exactly.

463
00:34:02,010 --> 00:34:06,010
But I... I've tried to persuade
her, but she's not interested.

464
00:34:06,610 --> 00:34:09,449
Is it cos the sex was really bad?
No!

465
00:34:09,450 --> 00:34:12,289
No, the sex was brilliant.
Yeah, maybe for you.

466
00:34:12,290 --> 00:34:15,649
It was... Listen. It's got nothing
to do with my sexual performance.

467
00:34:15,650 --> 00:34:17,969
I've just got to show her
it's her destiny, that's all.

468
00:34:17,970 --> 00:34:19,889
I mean it's all coming
together. It is.

469
00:34:19,890 --> 00:34:23,890
It's just there's... there's just
one more of you I need to find.

470
00:34:24,490 --> 00:34:27,209
Yeah.

471
00:34:27,210 --> 00:34:31,210
But three of us
to convince it's a good idea.

472
00:34:35,130 --> 00:34:37,169
How you doing, mate?

473
00:34:37,170 --> 00:34:38,809
It's weird.

474
00:34:38,810 --> 00:34:42,810
It's like I haven't got
the energy to keep living.

475
00:34:43,290 --> 00:34:46,849
And I was wondering why you felt like
that, to be honest with you, man.

476
00:34:46,850 --> 00:34:50,850
Why... why?
Has... something upset you?

477
00:34:51,490 --> 00:34:52,729
Like what? I don't know.

478
00:34:52,730 --> 00:34:54,849
Just... just something
very upsetting,

479
00:34:54,850 --> 00:34:57,809
like...

480
00:34:57,810 --> 00:35:01,810
..like a friend maybe doing
something to another friend?

481
00:35:04,730 --> 00:35:08,730
Was this you?
What were you doing?

482
00:35:10,210 --> 00:35:13,049
I was clubbing a baby seal.

483
00:35:13,050 --> 00:35:14,089
Why?

484
00:35:14,090 --> 00:35:18,009
Because we got into a bit of
a dispute over some fish.

485
00:35:18,010 --> 00:35:19,729
Neither of us were going to
back down.

486
00:35:19,730 --> 00:35:23,730
It all got a bit out of hand, to be honest
with you, so I fucking just boshed him.

487
00:35:25,250 --> 00:35:27,289
Bosh.

488
00:35:27,290 --> 00:35:29,209
Mm-hm.

489
00:35:29,210 --> 00:35:31,409
Someone should do that to me.

490
00:35:31,410 --> 00:35:35,410
Don't say shit like that, man.

491
00:35:35,930 --> 00:35:38,769
If they did,
could I have your GCSEs?

492
00:35:38,770 --> 00:35:41,089
Oi! Have you heard this shit?

493
00:35:41,090 --> 00:35:43,529
You know it's not transferable,
your GCSEs, when you die?

494
00:35:43,530 --> 00:35:46,089
Yeah. What the fuck
is all that about?

495
00:35:46,090 --> 00:35:48,729
You need a fucking GCSE in science
to understand all this shit.

496
00:35:48,730 --> 00:35:50,649
What did Finn say?
Has he found out about us?

497
00:35:50,650 --> 00:35:53,729
No, he thinks I've killed
a baby seal.

498
00:35:53,730 --> 00:35:55,329
Well, look, guys, all of this stuff,

499
00:35:55,330 --> 00:35:57,729
it's going to be something
to do with the storm, isn't it?

500
00:35:57,730 --> 00:36:00,729
Who's this fucking guy, man? Clever
and handsome. It's unbelievable.

501
00:36:00,730 --> 00:36:02,249
Just before Finn turned suicidal,

502
00:36:02,250 --> 00:36:04,649
I saw him talking to one of them
terminally ill people.

503
00:36:04,650 --> 00:36:06,529
What if he did something to him?

504
00:36:06,530 --> 00:36:09,329
Well...

505
00:36:09,330 --> 00:36:11,769
..they chose the wrong day
to do that.

506
00:36:11,770 --> 00:36:14,449
Just made a big mistake.

507
00:36:14,450 --> 00:36:16,409
They better be prepared
to meet the raper.

508
00:36:16,410 --> 00:36:18,169
Do you mean the reaper?

509
00:36:18,170 --> 00:36:21,569
No, I mean the raper.
I'm talking about him.

510
00:36:21,570 --> 00:36:25,570
Mate, I'm not a rapist.

511
00:36:31,170 --> 00:36:32,729
What did you do to our friend?

512
00:36:32,730 --> 00:36:36,730
Don't bother denying it,
cos we know it was you.

513
00:36:46,010 --> 00:36:49,369
Er... someone told me there was
a really nice view from the roof.

514
00:36:49,370 --> 00:36:51,569
Hm. I wouldn't say it's nice.

515
00:36:51,570 --> 00:36:53,969
It's just the same shit
from a different angle, really.

516
00:36:53,970 --> 00:36:57,970
Oh, I don't... I'd like
to see that.

517
00:37:08,250 --> 00:37:11,209
Get out of this one, you sneaky
bastard. Hey, hurry up.

518
00:37:11,210 --> 00:37:15,210
I'm hurrying up, man. Come on.

519
00:37:15,650 --> 00:37:19,650
Erm... this isn't as bad as it looks,
and I'm aware it looks bad.

520
00:37:20,730 --> 00:37:24,649
I think I know what happened to
your friend. Sorry? What?

521
00:37:24,650 --> 00:37:26,969
I know what happened to
your friend. Yeah, love.

522
00:37:26,970 --> 00:37:30,249
And so do we. It's time for this little
guy to meet the frigging raper.

523
00:37:30,250 --> 00:37:34,250
Can you stop calling me the raper?
It wasn't him. It was Lucas.

524
00:37:38,970 --> 00:37:41,969
Ah.

525
00:37:41,970 --> 00:37:45,970
Sorry, dude.

526
00:37:47,530 --> 00:37:50,689
Mate, are you OK?

527
00:37:50,690 --> 00:37:54,690
Will you hold me?

528
00:37:55,930 --> 00:37:58,529
I'm not going to shag you,
because I'm in love with my turtle.

529
00:37:58,530 --> 00:37:59,649
Oh. Oh, I...

530
00:37:59,650 --> 00:38:03,650
But I feel really bad about you dying and
everything, so I'll give you a hand job.

531
00:38:05,210 --> 00:38:08,449
Er...

532
00:38:08,450 --> 00:38:10,369
..would... would you hold me
afterwards?

533
00:38:10,370 --> 00:38:13,769
Hm, yeah, a wank and a cuddle.

534
00:38:13,770 --> 00:38:15,729
Just what the doctor ordered,
eh?

535
00:38:15,730 --> 00:38:19,730
Abby! Abby!

536
00:38:41,330 --> 00:38:45,330
Oh! Oh!

537
00:38:50,250 --> 00:38:54,089
Get the fuck away from him!

538
00:38:54,090 --> 00:38:55,809
Why is his cock out?

539
00:38:55,810 --> 00:38:57,849
Hand job.

540
00:38:57,850 --> 00:39:01,569
Look, he sucked the life
out of Finn.

541
00:39:01,570 --> 00:39:05,570
That's why Finn wants to die and why
that bloke threw himself off the roof.

542
00:39:07,690 --> 00:39:11,690
You did it to them, didn't you?

543
00:39:12,530 --> 00:39:15,209
What was I meant to do?

544
00:39:15,210 --> 00:39:19,009
I'm meant to just let myself die?

545
00:39:19,010 --> 00:39:23,010
No! No, you guys have
no idea what it feels like.

546
00:39:23,690 --> 00:39:27,690
I...I can feel myself dying.

547
00:39:27,810 --> 00:39:30,249
I can feel it

548
00:39:30,250 --> 00:39:32,729
and I'm scared.

549
00:39:32,730 --> 00:39:36,730
So, you're just going to keep doing
it, then, letting other people die?

550
00:39:37,730 --> 00:39:39,129
You are killing them!

551
00:39:39,130 --> 00:39:41,889
Just fuck off! Fuck you!

552
00:39:41,890 --> 00:39:44,489
OK, I never asked for this!

553
00:39:44,490 --> 00:39:46,169
Why me?

554
00:39:46,170 --> 00:39:48,689
Why has it got to be me?

555
00:39:48,690 --> 00:39:52,690
It's a crappy deal, mate. But all this
other shit is wrong, and you know it is.

556
00:39:53,730 --> 00:39:55,809
And, hey,

557
00:39:55,810 --> 00:39:58,289
he's an annoying little prick,

558
00:39:58,290 --> 00:40:01,489
but you've got to give
my mate his life back.

559
00:40:01,490 --> 00:40:04,409
No. Cos that's
the right thing to do.

560
00:40:04,410 --> 00:40:07,009
Oh, right, and me dying,
that's all right?

561
00:40:07,010 --> 00:40:10,809
Hey, I'm not saying it's fair.
It's shit, mate.

562
00:40:10,810 --> 00:40:14,169
But you've got to do
the right thing,

563
00:40:14,170 --> 00:40:17,169
or...

564
00:40:17,170 --> 00:40:20,649
..I'm going to have to do the
right thing.

565
00:40:20,650 --> 00:40:22,889
Yeah, and what's that, then?

566
00:40:22,890 --> 00:40:26,049
I'm going to have to wrestle you
to the floor, pin you down

567
00:40:26,050 --> 00:40:28,129
and fuck you up the arse
until I take your power.

568
00:40:28,130 --> 00:40:29,649
Oh!

569
00:40:29,650 --> 00:40:32,729
I'm sorry, that's meant... that's
meant to be the right thing to do?

570
00:40:32,730 --> 00:40:33,969
Yeah,

571
00:40:33,970 --> 00:40:37,970
in a totally fucked-up way...

572
00:40:38,370 --> 00:40:42,370
..I think it is.

573
00:40:52,570 --> 00:40:55,009
Hey.

574
00:40:55,010 --> 00:40:59,010
Hi.

575
00:41:02,210 --> 00:41:06,210
Will you hold me?

576
00:41:06,570 --> 00:41:10,570
I'd really like that.

577
00:41:59,930 --> 00:42:01,849
I should have helped you find
your keys.

578
00:42:01,850 --> 00:42:03,929
No, you couldn't,
because of your new jeans.

579
00:42:03,930 --> 00:42:06,449
I know. Sorry.
I... I was a massive twat.

580
00:42:06,450 --> 00:42:10,450
But I have been the Good fucking
Samaritan with bells on. Lesson learned.

581
00:42:11,850 --> 00:42:15,850
So, are you... are you going to...
lift the curse or what?

582
00:42:17,890 --> 00:42:21,890
Two bottles of white wine,
and we'll call it quits.

583
00:42:30,730 --> 00:42:33,609
Well, go on, then.
Lift the curse.

584
00:42:33,610 --> 00:42:37,610
I took it off when you came
round to my flat that time.

585
00:42:38,250 --> 00:42:41,209
You seemed really upset
about the guy killing himself.

586
00:42:41,210 --> 00:42:42,690
I felt bad.

587
00:42:46,690 --> 00:42:48,249
Well, you could have told me.

588
00:42:48,250 --> 00:42:51,649
Thank you very, very much.

589
00:42:51,650 --> 00:42:54,849
So, I'm... I'm thinking...

590
00:42:54,850 --> 00:42:57,369
..that the least that you can do,

591
00:42:57,370 --> 00:43:00,289
now, is have a drink with me.

592
00:43:00,290 --> 00:43:04,089
I'm gay.

593
00:43:04,090 --> 00:43:08,090
You're a lesbian Gypsy?
Mm-hm.

594
00:43:20,690 --> 00:43:22,369
Rudy?

595
00:43:22,370 --> 00:43:26,370
Mm? Why are you wearing
the sex bag?

596
00:43:26,770 --> 00:43:30,249
I'm fed up. I've renamed it
the bag of eternal shame.

597
00:43:30,250 --> 00:43:34,250
And I will not take it off
until the frigging end of time,

598
00:43:34,330 --> 00:43:37,569
or my cock gets hard,
whatever happens first.

599
00:43:37,570 --> 00:43:38,609
I'm over here, babe.

600
00:43:38,610 --> 00:43:40,569
Are you? Yeah.

601
00:43:40,570 --> 00:43:44,570
Oh. Listen, I've been having
a think about...

602
00:43:50,290 --> 00:43:52,369
I've been having a think.
Yeah?

603
00:43:52,370 --> 00:43:55,489
About why you and my cock,
you're not getting on,

604
00:43:55,490 --> 00:43:59,490
and I just think you might, um...

605
00:43:59,890 --> 00:44:01,929
..I think you intimidate him.

606
00:44:01,930 --> 00:44:04,649
And just, it's me and my knob,
we have a bit of a chequered past.

607
00:44:04,650 --> 00:44:08,650
I mean, honest to God,
you are like a bloody...

608
00:44:09,890 --> 00:44:13,449
You're perfect, you...
You're this innocent little...
You're like an angel.

609
00:44:13,450 --> 00:44:16,729
No, I'm not an angel. You are.
You're an angel to me.

610
00:44:16,730 --> 00:44:20,689
You are, and you... and you make
my dick hang his head in shame.

611
00:44:20,690 --> 00:44:24,690
Right.

612
00:44:27,410 --> 00:44:31,410
I love the smell of my own farts.
I thought that was just me.

613
00:44:31,490 --> 00:44:34,129
No. I bite my nails.

614
00:44:34,130 --> 00:44:36,729
Erm...

615
00:44:36,730 --> 00:44:40,689
I eat the dead skin off my feet.

616
00:44:40,690 --> 00:44:43,409
I use a hairbrush
to scratch my fanny. Oh?

617
00:44:43,410 --> 00:44:47,410
Erm... last week, I shoved
a cock-shaped potato up myself.

618
00:44:47,930 --> 00:44:51,930
It's usually a cucumber, but I'd used it
to make a salad, so there you go.

619
00:44:52,490 --> 00:44:54,289
Fucking hell.

620
00:44:54,290 --> 00:44:58,290
I'm not pure or perfect.
So, that's me.

621
00:45:01,330 --> 00:45:05,330
And I love you.

622
00:45:07,050 --> 00:45:09,129
Oh, you...

623
00:45:09,130 --> 00:45:13,130
sarcastic bastard.

624
00:45:31,050 --> 00:45:33,009
I think you've been looking for me.

625
00:45:33,010 --> 00:45:35,209
I have been look...
I have been looking for you!

626
00:45:35,210 --> 00:45:38,329
You're the final piece
of the superhero jumper puzzle.

627
00:45:38,330 --> 00:45:39,409
Look at that, eh?

628
00:45:39,410 --> 00:45:42,169
I...I knew it.
It's all coming together.

629
00:45:42,170 --> 00:45:46,170
I...I can't wait for you
to meet the others.

630
00:45:52,399 --> 00:45:54,838
You are superheroes, guys,
you are.

631
00:45:54,839 --> 00:45:55,998
The jumper posse?

632
00:45:55,999 --> 00:45:58,478
Tomorrow's the one-year
anniversary of the storm.

633
00:45:58,479 --> 00:46:00,718
We're having a party here
at the Community Centre.

634
00:46:00,719 --> 00:46:04,318
There will be vodka and drugs
and people fucking each other.

635
00:46:04,319 --> 00:46:08,238
You know ecstasy reverses
your power?

636
00:46:08,239 --> 00:46:10,278
That's not how it looked, Finn.

637
00:46:10,279 --> 00:46:12,438
You and me, we're finished!

638
00:46:12,439 --> 00:46:14,038
Women don't know what they do to us.

639
00:46:14,039 --> 00:46:16,678
I had a girlfriend once. Roxy.

640
00:46:16,679 --> 00:46:19,549
You know, this really is
the worst party ever.
