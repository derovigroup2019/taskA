1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,800
This is our destiny.
We're getting a better name.

2
00:00:03,868 --> 00:00:05,707
There's nothing I can do
to help anyone,

3
00:00:05,708 --> 00:00:07,867
but you can make a difference.

4
00:00:07,868 --> 00:00:11,707
You're the only one out of us who
can actually change people's lives.

5
00:00:11,708 --> 00:00:13,667
What's going to happen
if we do have the baby?

6
00:00:13,668 --> 00:00:16,427
You're just going to disappear
and leave me to fend for myself?

7
00:00:16,428 --> 00:00:19,827
If you want someone who's gonna be a
good dad and look after this fucking baby,

8
00:00:19,828 --> 00:00:23,187
you've got the wrong Rudy, cos I'm
the shit one, or don't you remember that?

9
00:00:23,188 --> 00:00:24,707
Fuck you!

10
00:00:24,708 --> 00:00:28,708
Fucking coward.

11
00:00:30,748 --> 00:00:33,467
Do you know...

12
00:00:33,468 --> 00:00:35,307
what today is?

13
00:00:35,308 --> 00:00:37,227
Tuesday?

14
00:00:37,228 --> 00:00:40,107
Today...

15
00:00:40,108 --> 00:00:43,227
is the last day
of your community service.

16
00:00:43,228 --> 00:00:44,787
It's all over.

17
00:00:44,788 --> 00:00:46,787
Seriously?

18
00:00:46,788 --> 00:00:49,867
Are... Are you kidding?

19
00:00:49,868 --> 00:00:53,027
And you had a chance
to do something positive,

20
00:00:53,028 --> 00:00:54,587
to give something back,

21
00:00:54,588 --> 00:00:55,827
to help people,

22
00:00:55,828 --> 00:00:59,828
to really make a difference
to their lives.

23
00:01:01,308 --> 00:01:04,507
You failed.

24
00:01:04,508 --> 00:01:05,948
Dismally.

25
00:01:08,748 --> 00:01:12,107
Do you want to know
what the real tragedy is?

26
00:01:12,108 --> 00:01:14,147
This moment...

27
00:01:14,148 --> 00:01:15,587
right here...

28
00:01:15,588 --> 00:01:17,667
right now...

29
00:01:17,668 --> 00:01:20,289
this is as good as it gets
for you.

31
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:10,100
Hello?

32
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:17,739
What have you done to this place?

33
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:20,499
It's a superhero lair.

34
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:22,339
Guys.

35
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:24,579
It's your superhero lair.

36
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:26,819
They're your costumes.

37
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:30,379
You're gonna be on
community service.

38
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:32,699
It... It's your secret identity.

39
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:35,219
Do we actually have to go round
picking up litter and shit?

40
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:37,699
No, you don't have to go round
picking...

41
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:41,700
You just pretend you're picking up
litter, and EXCREMENT.

42
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:45,099
No-one's gonna suspect
you're superheroes.

43
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:49,100
They'll just think you're...
a bunch of useless ASBO delinquents.

44
00:02:57,940 --> 00:03:01,940
Let's do some good.

45
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:07,899
What are you looking at?

46
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:10,419
You shouldn't break into
other people's cars.

47
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:12,539
What's that?

48
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:15,099
You shouldn't... break into cars.

49
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:19,100
Jog on, or I will fuck you up!

50
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:27,060
For fuck's sake.

51
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:32,019
What are you doing?
You've killed him!

52
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:33,099
That's really bad.

53
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:36,339
He's fine. I just stunned him.

54
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:37,579
What do we do with him?

55
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:39,739
What would other superheroes do?

56
00:03:39,740 --> 00:03:43,099
The Hulk'd do this.

57
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:45,779
Rarrhh!

58
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:49,780
Aaah!

59
00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:00,139
Police?

60
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:03,699
I want to report a crime.

61
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:07,700
I really liked your Hulk impression.

62
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:11,820
I like the idea of being a nurse...

63
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:14,019
or a shepherd.

64
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:16,179
What qualifications do you need
to be a shepherd?

65
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:18,059
You need a crook, a well-trained
Border collie

66
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:20,019
and a profound love of sheep,
love. I'll tell you where

67
00:04:20,020 --> 00:04:22,379
I'm not gonna be in a year's time,
and that is...

68
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:24,339
working behind a bar.

69
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:28,340
I, for one, will be enjoying my life
as a multimillionaire!

70
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:30,939
Scratch card?!

71
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:34,019
That's genius.
Why didn't I think of that?

72
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:35,419
Well, not everyone's as blessed

73
00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:39,019
in the brains and trouser department
as I am, are they?

74
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:42,619
If you play enough of 'em, odds are
you're in for a big win,

75
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:45,739
and that's just basic science.
Mm.

76
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:47,779
One more melon, that's me.

77
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:49,779
You fucking... apple!

78
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:51,739
Oh...
For fuck's sake!

79
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:53,179
Oh.
A shame.

80
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:55,219
Piss off.

81
00:04:55,220 --> 00:04:57,259
What?

82
00:04:57,260 --> 00:04:59,899
You all right?
Yeah, man, never better.

83
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:03,179
Never better.

84
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:07,179
What? Do I detect an overwhelming
sense of sexual disappointment?

85
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:08,659
Prick.

86
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:12,179
Why can't you just be happy for me?

87
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:14,979
Oh, man, it was a joke.
For fuck's... God. For fuck's sake.

88
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:16,060
Are you all right?

89
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:29,139
Jess. Jess, please.
Just give me... give me a minute.

90
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:32,979
How much longer are you going to
punish me for... I fucking panicked.

91
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:36,139
All I could see before me
was impending fatherhood,

92
00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:38,459
followed by middle age
and then death.

93
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:40,059
I needed you,
and you weren't there for me.

94
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:44,060
I know I wasn't there for you.
I know, but I am here now.

95
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:47,340
It's who you are.

96
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:53,259
I was stupid to think
this could work.

97
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:54,299
I can't do this.

98
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:58,300
Jess. For fuck's sake.

99
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:05,859
You go first.

100
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:07,859
Do you know what?

101
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:10,499
Erm... I wasn't actually
going to put anything on.

102
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:14,500
I was just using it as an excuse
to get away from someone. Ha-ha!

103
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:21,180
Can I buy you a drink?

104
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:26,540
Yeah... actually, sure.

105
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:45,739
I should go.

106
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:47,739
When can I see you again?

107
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:50,699
Things are really complicated
for me right now.

108
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:52,779
I like you. You like me.

109
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:54,899
Just give me a chance.

110
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:57,499
Get to know me. I'm a cool guy.

111
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:59,819
You just have to spend some time
with me.

112
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:02,179
We had a nice time.
Let's just leave it at that, yeah?

113
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:03,979
We can make this work.

114
00:07:03,980 --> 00:07:06,579
We have a future together.

115
00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:07,979
Mm, we don't have a future.

116
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:10,059
You don't decide.

117
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:11,380
I do.

118
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:14,539
Get off.

119
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:16,779
Get your fucking hand off me!

120
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:20,780
I'll show you.

121
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:36,899
I should go.

122
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:38,539
Go where?

123
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:40,819
Home.

124
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:44,820
This IS your home.

125
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:50,619
What is that?

126
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:53,100
It's our son.

127
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:56,259
He wants you.

128
00:07:56,260 --> 00:07:58,299
He needs... feeding.

129
00:07:58,300 --> 00:07:59,939
Is this supposed to be funny?

130
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:03,019
He's our son.

131
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:04,940
Look at him.

132
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:22,219
He's got your eyes.

133
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:23,939
What did you do?

134
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:27,940
I threw us forward through time.

135
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:30,659
We had a baby.

136
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:32,859
We're parents.

137
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:34,299
No, I haven't got a fucking baby.

138
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:38,299
Do you want to hold him?

139
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:40,459
He's... He's not mine.

140
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:43,779
I know it's confusing...

141
00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:45,179
but you have a new life now,

142
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:48,619
and me and Leo are a big part of it.

143
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:50,619
He needs you.

144
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:54,620
He needs his mum.

145
00:08:58,460 --> 00:09:01,339
He's so beautiful.

146
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:02,899
Take me back.

147
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:06,900
I want you to take me back in time.
You fix this.

148
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:08,499
You take me back.

149
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:10,659
This is your life now.

150
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:14,419
You accept that,
or I'll throw us back through time.

151
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:16,859
I'll keep doing it
until I get it right.

152
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:19,379
You won't remember a thing.

153
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:22,819
We can do this again
and again and again

154
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:25,059
I'm not giving up you and our baby.

155
00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:29,060
I will never fall in love with you,
you creepy, fucking prick!

156
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:32,459
Give it time.

157
00:09:32,460 --> 00:09:36,460
I can give us all the time we need.

158
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:40,459
You're not like the other girls.

159
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:41,859
You've done this before.

160
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:44,139
Spend the day with him.

161
00:09:44,140 --> 00:09:47,619
He is going to break your heart.

162
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:51,620
I have to get ready for work.

163
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:58,259
You can't do this.

164
00:09:58,260 --> 00:10:02,072
You can't leave me with him!
He's not my fucking baby!

165
00:10:23,704 --> 00:10:25,864
'Sorry.
The number you have called

166
00:10:25,866 --> 00:10:27,465
'is currently unavailable.

167
00:10:27,466 --> 00:10:30,306
'Please try again later.'
What the fuck?

168
00:10:41,346 --> 00:10:42,625
Finn?

169
00:10:42,626 --> 00:10:44,865
Oh, thank God!

170
00:10:44,866 --> 00:10:48,866
Finn!

171
00:10:52,706 --> 00:10:55,865
Where's Finn?

172
00:10:55,866 --> 00:10:59,866
I think he's in the office.

173
00:11:11,906 --> 00:11:13,105
Finn?

174
00:11:13,106 --> 00:11:15,825
Shit. Yes? Jess?

175
00:11:15,826 --> 00:11:18,185
Oh, my God. Where have you been?

176
00:11:18,186 --> 00:11:20,905
What happened to you?
You... you disappeared.

177
00:11:20,906 --> 00:11:24,025
Er... Er, there's this guy
called Luke.

178
00:11:24,026 --> 00:11:28,026
He used this power and he says
he threw me through time. I...

179
00:11:29,426 --> 00:11:30,905
Oh.

180
00:11:30,906 --> 00:11:33,005
What?

181
00:11:33,006 --> 00:11:36,365
Is that yours?

182
00:11:36,366 --> 00:11:38,245
He says it's mine.

183
00:11:38,246 --> 00:11:40,366
This is fucked up.

184
00:11:40,426 --> 00:11:41,326
You just vanished.

185
00:11:41,399 --> 00:11:44,278
We searched everywhere. We...

186
00:11:44,279 --> 00:11:46,558
We thought you were dead.

187
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:50,559
None of us has seen you
in over a year.

188
00:11:52,199 --> 00:11:53,998
Why are you wearing an ID badge?

189
00:11:53,999 --> 00:11:55,958
And why are you...

190
00:11:55,959 --> 00:11:57,638
dressed like a dick?

191
00:11:57,639 --> 00:11:59,438
I'm a trainee probation worker.

192
00:11:59,439 --> 00:12:01,438
This is the required look.

193
00:12:01,439 --> 00:12:03,758
You're a trainee probation worker?!

194
00:12:03,759 --> 00:12:06,839
Yes.

195
00:12:08,919 --> 00:12:12,919
You're shitting me, aren't you?

196
00:12:13,439 --> 00:12:17,439
It's amazing to think
that came out of Jess's twat.

197
00:12:18,719 --> 00:12:21,958
You are an industrial tribunal just
waiting to happen.

198
00:12:21,959 --> 00:12:23,879
It's called a vagina.

199
00:12:25,199 --> 00:12:27,198
You're not going to bloody
believe this.

200
00:12:27,199 --> 00:12:29,238
There's no golf sale.
How do you mean?

201
00:12:29,239 --> 00:12:33,239
Well, I've been standing out there
for two weeks holding this poxy sign.

202
00:12:33,319 --> 00:12:36,318
I go to collect my wages.
There's no golf sale.

203
00:12:36,319 --> 00:12:40,239
I think I've been the victim
of a cruel practical joke.

204
00:12:43,319 --> 00:12:44,678
Oh, cute baby.

205
00:12:44,679 --> 00:12:48,679
Yeah, about the baby...

206
00:12:53,319 --> 00:12:56,878
Do you know what I was doing...

207
00:12:56,879 --> 00:12:59,198
when you so...

208
00:12:59,199 --> 00:13:01,998
rudely interrupted me?

209
00:13:01,999 --> 00:13:03,598
I'm guessing it wasn't showering.

210
00:13:03,599 --> 00:13:07,599
I was 19? hours into
a Murder, She Wrote marathon.

211
00:13:09,439 --> 00:13:10,718
Jess is back.

212
00:13:10,719 --> 00:13:12,278
Where is she?

213
00:13:12,279 --> 00:13:14,078
She's in the shitter.

214
00:13:14,079 --> 00:13:17,918
She said something about some bloke
who's thrown her forward through time.

215
00:13:17,919 --> 00:13:19,238
Are you OK?

216
00:13:19,239 --> 00:13:21,719
Yeah, I'm fine. I'm fine.

217
00:13:24,479 --> 00:13:28,318
So, the worm's returned...

218
00:13:28,319 --> 00:13:31,838
with her fuckin' bushy tail
between her legs.

219
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:33,638
It's too late, guys.

220
00:13:33,639 --> 00:13:35,398
It's too late,

221
00:13:35,399 --> 00:13:39,158
because I had forgot
about her very existence.

222
00:13:39,159 --> 00:13:42,038
She's back.

223
00:13:42,039 --> 00:13:44,118
My Jessica's back.

224
00:13:44,119 --> 00:13:45,558
Oh, wow,

225
00:13:45,559 --> 00:13:47,359
I need to sit down.

226
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:06,399
Is he having a mental breakdown?

227
00:14:06,559 --> 00:14:10,559
Rudy?

228
00:14:11,439 --> 00:14:14,559
Hello, Jess.

229
00:14:17,959 --> 00:14:20,278
Oh.

230
00:14:20,279 --> 00:14:22,078
You look like shit.

231
00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:24,238
It's been a bit of a rough year.

232
00:14:24,239 --> 00:14:28,239
Me vigorous grooming and personal
hygiene regime might have...

233
00:14:30,239 --> 00:14:33,718
slipped just a bit.

234
00:14:33,719 --> 00:14:37,719
Did... did Finn tell you about...
about the baby?

235
00:14:41,319 --> 00:14:43,478
Is that...

236
00:14:43,479 --> 00:14:45,718
Is he mine?

237
00:14:45,719 --> 00:14:48,598
I don't know. I don't...
I don't think so.

238
00:14:48,599 --> 00:14:52,599
I think it's Luke's.
Who the fuck is Luke?

239
00:15:04,879 --> 00:15:08,879
Are you gonna pick that up?

240
00:15:09,759 --> 00:15:13,759
YOU pick it up. In't that
what you're supposed to be doing?

241
00:15:21,479 --> 00:15:25,439
How high is that?
It's high.

242
00:15:27,079 --> 00:15:30,198
Ugh...

243
00:15:30,199 --> 00:15:31,238
What are you doing?!

244
00:15:31,239 --> 00:15:33,478
You drop him right there?
You've splattered us.

245
00:15:33,479 --> 00:15:35,158
I've told you before.

246
00:15:35,159 --> 00:15:36,918
Yeah, well...

247
00:15:36,919 --> 00:15:40,919
it's one less wanker to deal with.

248
00:16:17,599 --> 00:16:20,118
How's it going?
See any action?

249
00:16:20,119 --> 00:16:22,278
Nothing much.
We caught some guy dropping litter.

250
00:16:22,279 --> 00:16:23,998
What did you do to him?

251
00:16:23,999 --> 00:16:26,358
We let him off with a very stern
warning.

252
00:16:26,359 --> 00:16:28,358
Hmm. He won't be doing that again.

253
00:16:28,359 --> 00:16:29,958
What are you up to?

254
00:16:29,959 --> 00:16:32,078
I'm just...
I'm going through the papers.

255
00:16:32,079 --> 00:16:36,079
Huh.

256
00:16:36,759 --> 00:16:40,759
Are you staying at mine tonight?
Yeah.

257
00:16:47,599 --> 00:16:50,318
Ooh.
Are you all right?

258
00:16:50,319 --> 00:16:52,998
What?

259
00:16:52,999 --> 00:16:55,118
I've had an 'aircut.

260
00:16:55,119 --> 00:16:58,438
'Ere. Crisps are for you.

261
00:16:58,439 --> 00:16:59,998
Milk's for 'im.

262
00:16:59,999 --> 00:17:03,999
And this scratchcard's for me.
Game on. Let's do this.

263
00:17:05,479 --> 00:17:09,479
Oh, you fuck...

264
00:17:12,639 --> 00:17:15,838
How's Rudy 2?

265
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:18,918
We just... We don't see
much of each other any more.

266
00:17:18,919 --> 00:17:20,438
Birthdays.

267
00:17:20,439 --> 00:17:22,518
Religious holidays - Easter...

268
00:17:22,519 --> 00:17:23,998
Christmas...

269
00:17:23,999 --> 00:17:25,558
Ramadan.

270
00:17:25,559 --> 00:17:29,559
Hah...

271
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:33,679
I never stopped, you know.

272
00:17:33,999 --> 00:17:36,078
I never stopped looking for you.

273
00:17:36,079 --> 00:17:38,118
I always sort of hoped and prayed

274
00:17:38,119 --> 00:17:42,119
you'd just come sashaying
through the door...

275
00:17:42,399 --> 00:17:44,398
just give me one of them killer
smiles,

276
00:17:44,399 --> 00:17:46,358
and I could just tell you
how sorry I was.

277
00:17:46,359 --> 00:17:48,638
Look...

278
00:17:48,639 --> 00:17:52,639
I'm not going to pretend
that I wasn't angry with you.

279
00:17:52,679 --> 00:17:55,598
But this... this...

280
00:17:55,599 --> 00:17:59,599
whole thing is so messed up.

281
00:18:00,719 --> 00:18:04,638
I don't even feel like it's my baby.

282
00:18:04,639 --> 00:18:06,438
I don't feel...

283
00:18:06,439 --> 00:18:10,439
anything.

284
00:18:12,119 --> 00:18:13,758
Mm-hm.

285
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:17,278
He's got your eyes.

286
00:18:17,279 --> 00:18:21,279
A beautiful chestnut brown.

287
00:18:21,399 --> 00:18:23,558
You all right, little man?

288
00:18:23,559 --> 00:18:25,919
How you diddling?

289
00:18:28,159 --> 00:18:32,158
Christ, look at his tiny
little 'ands.

290
00:18:32,159 --> 00:18:35,678
Strong enough to crush
a grown man's heart, they are.

291
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:39,679
He'd squeeze the life right
out of him.

292
00:18:42,519 --> 00:18:46,198
So, what happens now?

293
00:18:46,199 --> 00:18:50,199
I have no fucking idea
what happens now.

294
00:19:07,999 --> 00:19:11,999
Those three, they...
Mm.

295
00:19:19,359 --> 00:19:20,718
Speak.

296
00:19:20,719 --> 00:19:23,838
Head office called.

297
00:19:23,839 --> 00:19:27,839
There's no record of them being
sentenced to community service.

298
00:19:29,279 --> 00:19:33,038
They... shouldn't be here.

299
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:37,039
Well, there's a perfectly reasonable
way to handle this.

300
00:19:37,839 --> 00:19:38,878
Which is?

301
00:19:38,879 --> 00:19:40,678
Why are you here?

302
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:42,918
Why?

303
00:19:42,919 --> 00:19:44,918
Why? Why? Why?

304
00:19:44,919 --> 00:19:48,919
Why? Why? Why? Why?!

305
00:19:49,359 --> 00:19:53,359
A probation worker
must learn to wear many masks.

306
00:19:56,879 --> 00:20:00,598
Best friend.

307
00:20:00,599 --> 00:20:04,318
Father figure.

308
00:20:04,319 --> 00:20:08,319
Tearful clown.

309
00:20:11,159 --> 00:20:12,479
What's up, dawg?

310
00:20:15,639 --> 00:20:17,158
Help me out with something.

311
00:20:17,159 --> 00:20:21,159
There's no record of you ever being
sentenced to community service.

312
00:20:21,239 --> 00:20:24,598
So, I was kind of wondering,
you know, why you're here.

313
00:20:24,599 --> 00:20:28,599
You know, I'm sure there's other things you
could be doing, pretty girl like yourself.

314
00:20:38,639 --> 00:20:41,158
You killed the trainee probation
worker!

315
00:20:41,159 --> 00:20:43,318
I only stunned him.

316
00:20:43,319 --> 00:20:45,718
He's on to us.

317
00:20:45,719 --> 00:20:48,838
What do we do with him? We'll have
to bury him under the flyover.

318
00:20:48,839 --> 00:20:52,839
We've buried so many people. There's no
room left under the flyover. What's that?

319
00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:55,758
There's no room.

320
00:20:55,759 --> 00:20:57,720
We'll have to start
double-banking 'em.

321
00:21:02,719 --> 00:21:06,719
Oh, shit. Shovels.

322
00:21:51,253 --> 00:21:55,253
I know what you've been doing.

323
00:21:55,533 --> 00:21:57,452
You've been killing people.

324
00:21:57,453 --> 00:21:59,612
Kind of.

325
00:21:59,613 --> 00:22:00,892
Only people that deserve it.

326
00:22:00,893 --> 00:22:04,572
Only wankers!
You don't get to decide, Sam.

327
00:22:04,573 --> 00:22:06,172
This is not how it's supposed to be.

328
00:22:06,173 --> 00:22:08,932
You're meant to be superheroes.
You're telling me

329
00:22:08,933 --> 00:22:11,852
the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
never killed some ignorant fucker

330
00:22:11,853 --> 00:22:15,532
for dropping litter or shitting in
the street? No, they didn't.

331
00:22:15,533 --> 00:22:19,292
Leonardo, Michelangelo,
Donatello and Raphael

332
00:22:19,293 --> 00:22:21,252
would never have done
any of them things.

333
00:22:21,253 --> 00:22:23,412
They lived by a code! OK.

334
00:22:23,413 --> 00:22:24,772
Bad example.

335
00:22:24,773 --> 00:22:28,212
But, look, you just get so sick
of dealing with the same scumbags.

336
00:22:28,213 --> 00:22:30,412
The courts don't do anything.

337
00:22:30,413 --> 00:22:34,052
A fine? Community service?
It's a joke.

338
00:22:34,053 --> 00:22:36,852
We came up with
a more permanent solution.

339
00:22:36,853 --> 00:22:38,012
Murdering 'em?

340
00:22:38,013 --> 00:22:41,532
If you say it like that,
it sounds bad.

341
00:22:41,533 --> 00:22:44,412
We'd really like you to be OK
with this.

342
00:22:44,413 --> 00:22:47,012
I'm not OK with it!

343
00:22:47,013 --> 00:22:48,492
I'm not OK!

344
00:22:48,493 --> 00:22:51,412
I'm very far from being OK!

345
00:22:51,413 --> 00:22:55,413
I'm actually very bloody angry!

346
00:23:01,853 --> 00:23:05,853
D'you know what?

347
00:23:06,933 --> 00:23:08,572
What are you doing?

348
00:23:08,573 --> 00:23:11,612
Well, he wanted to suckle on
something and you weren't 'ere.

349
00:23:11,613 --> 00:23:15,613
I know they're not as beautiful as yours,
like, but any nipple in a storm. Eh, mate?

350
00:23:17,533 --> 00:23:20,692
Do you want him? It's not sucking
on my tit. Put it in the pram.

351
00:23:20,693 --> 00:23:22,372
All right.

352
00:23:22,373 --> 00:23:26,373
Come on. One sec. Here we go,
here we go, here we go, here we go.

353
00:23:28,413 --> 00:23:32,413
Woof, woof, woof, woof, woof,
woof, woof, woof, woof!

354
00:23:32,853 --> 00:23:35,612
Is that milk?

355
00:23:35,613 --> 00:23:39,613
Oh, my God!

356
00:23:39,773 --> 00:23:43,773
I'm lactating.

357
00:23:45,013 --> 00:23:46,853
Love's stronger than biology, guys.

358
00:23:51,493 --> 00:23:53,372
Hi, it's... it's me.

359
00:23:53,373 --> 00:23:55,812
Listen, I... I've made
a terrible error of judgment.

360
00:23:55,813 --> 00:23:57,532
'You were right about Helen.'

361
00:23:57,533 --> 00:23:59,772
What? She's not an electrician,
is she?

362
00:23:59,773 --> 00:24:03,052
She don't know her... I knew it.
It's just one big lie.

363
00:24:03,053 --> 00:24:04,812
'No. I've... I've started something.

364
00:24:04,813 --> 00:24:06,652
'I... I thought I was
doing something good'

365
00:24:06,653 --> 00:24:09,172
but Helen and the others,
they're killing people.

366
00:24:09,173 --> 00:24:11,732
'They almost got Finn.
I've got to stop 'em.'

367
00:24:11,733 --> 00:24:13,132
No, no, no, no.

368
00:24:13,133 --> 00:24:15,612
What are you...? Where...
Where are you now?

369
00:24:15,613 --> 00:24:19,012
Listen, I just...
I want you to know...

370
00:24:19,013 --> 00:24:22,452
I'm sorry, and I should...
I should never have left you.

371
00:24:22,453 --> 00:24:24,172
We belong together. I'm...

372
00:24:24,173 --> 00:24:26,652
Where are you?
Tell me where you are.

373
00:24:26,653 --> 00:24:28,812
'I can come and get you then,
can't I? Where are you?'

374
00:24:28,813 --> 00:24:31,772
I love you, man.

375
00:24:31,773 --> 00:24:33,372
Oh, for fuck's sake!

376
00:24:33,373 --> 00:24:34,652
What's going on, Rudy?

377
00:24:34,653 --> 00:24:37,892
It's Rudy 2. He says his electrician
girlfriend's frigging killing people,

378
00:24:37,893 --> 00:24:40,372
for Christ's sake!

379
00:24:40,373 --> 00:24:41,812
You're not going to believe this.

380
00:24:41,813 --> 00:24:45,813
Those community service pricks,
fucking little fuckers.

381
00:24:47,253 --> 00:24:48,892
They tried to kill me!

382
00:24:48,893 --> 00:24:52,732
Well, they chose
the wrong day to do that, Finlay...

383
00:24:52,733 --> 00:24:56,733
cos I'm feeling very hormonal.

384
00:25:16,613 --> 00:25:18,132
They're coming.

385
00:25:18,133 --> 00:25:20,493
I suppose you'd better kill 'em.

386
00:25:24,413 --> 00:25:26,172
OK, as I see it,

387
00:25:26,173 --> 00:25:29,412
we're getting into a fight with people
with much better superpowers than us.

388
00:25:29,413 --> 00:25:31,652
Define better. Flying.

389
00:25:31,653 --> 00:25:34,732
He's got a point.

390
00:25:34,733 --> 00:25:37,172
That is actually very impressive.

391
00:25:37,173 --> 00:25:40,492
Oh, my God! That is...
That's a man flying.

392
00:25:40,493 --> 00:25:44,493
That's like roller-skating cats. I never
thought I'd see that, not in my lifetime.

393
00:25:44,973 --> 00:25:48,973
What's the plan?
Do we... Do we have a plan?

394
00:25:49,133 --> 00:25:53,133
Running's a plan!
There's no shame in running!

395
00:25:57,893 --> 00:25:58,972
You prick!

396
00:25:58,973 --> 00:26:01,972
So what I'm thinking you need to do,
you need to mount him in mid-flight,

397
00:26:01,973 --> 00:26:05,292
you need to rip his jumpsuit off,
and just fuck his power out of him.

398
00:26:05,293 --> 00:26:09,293
Oh, is... is that it? I don't need to cook
him dinner first or anything like that?

399
00:26:09,373 --> 00:26:13,373
Bloody hell! If you think you can't do it...
Erm... I didn't say that. I could do it.

400
00:26:13,533 --> 00:26:16,092
Erm... I don't think you could.

401
00:26:16,093 --> 00:26:18,853
Seriously, what a shit idea!

402
00:26:22,053 --> 00:26:24,772
It's amazing
what you can goad people into.

403
00:26:24,773 --> 00:26:27,532
Vanity and pride have been the
undoing of many a great man, Finlay.

404
00:26:27,533 --> 00:26:30,772
Roy Castle, God rest his soul.
He died of cancer, Rudy.

405
00:26:30,773 --> 00:26:34,773
I thought he tap-danced himself
to death.

406
00:26:42,773 --> 00:26:46,773
Get off me. Get off!

407
00:26:51,613 --> 00:26:54,892
Oh, my God. He's actually doing it.
Go on! You can do it!

408
00:26:54,893 --> 00:26:57,572
I never doubted you, man!
Go on, you handsome barman!

409
00:26:57,573 --> 00:26:59,212
Shall I? No!

410
00:26:59,213 --> 00:27:03,213
I'm the fucking superhero!

411
00:27:04,173 --> 00:27:06,972
Oh-oh-oh...

412
00:27:06,973 --> 00:27:09,532
Shit!
He didn't think this through.

413
00:27:09,533 --> 00:27:13,533
Flap your arms! Flap!

414
00:27:26,293 --> 00:27:28,893
Handsome barman?

415
00:27:33,493 --> 00:27:37,493
Oh, dude! Told you I could do it.

416
00:27:48,933 --> 00:27:50,972
You betrayed me.

417
00:27:50,973 --> 00:27:53,132
I never meant you to find out.

418
00:27:53,133 --> 00:27:54,372
Look, I can explain.

419
00:27:54,373 --> 00:27:56,532
I loved you.

420
00:27:56,533 --> 00:28:00,533
With all me heart.

421
00:28:03,613 --> 00:28:07,613
I'm sorry.

422
00:28:11,173 --> 00:28:12,812
Will you wait here?

423
00:28:12,813 --> 00:28:14,452
I want to help.

424
00:28:14,453 --> 00:28:18,453
I know you want to help,
but you've got to look after him.

425
00:28:18,693 --> 00:28:22,693
Listen, I know he's not mine.

426
00:28:23,213 --> 00:28:27,172
But I will love him like he was
my own if that's what you want.

427
00:28:27,173 --> 00:28:31,173
D-Don't... Don't answer it now.
Just...

428
00:28:31,493 --> 00:28:35,493
think about it, yeah?

429
00:28:37,573 --> 00:28:41,573
Rudy.

430
00:28:42,213 --> 00:28:43,972
Be careful.

431
00:28:43,973 --> 00:28:47,452
Of course I'll be careful.

432
00:28:47,453 --> 00:28:51,453
Careful's my middle name.
Rudy Careful Geoffrey Wade.

433
00:29:15,613 --> 00:29:17,372
Oh, come on.

434
00:29:17,373 --> 00:29:19,212
It's all right.

435
00:29:19,213 --> 00:29:23,173
All right. Come on. Oh.

436
00:29:25,293 --> 00:29:28,852
You worried about Rudy? Hm?

437
00:29:28,853 --> 00:29:32,612
Me too.

438
00:29:32,613 --> 00:29:33,812
It's OK.

439
00:29:33,813 --> 00:29:37,813
He'll be all right.

440
00:29:40,213 --> 00:29:44,213
Don't do that to me.

441
00:29:46,613 --> 00:29:50,613
What are you doing to me?

442
00:30:01,573 --> 00:30:04,652
Sh, sh.

443
00:30:04,653 --> 00:30:06,532
I heard something.
What?

444
00:30:06,533 --> 00:30:08,253
Sh!

445
00:30:13,173 --> 00:30:17,173
Follow me.

446
00:30:27,493 --> 00:30:31,493
Oh...

447
00:30:31,613 --> 00:30:35,613
You won't have realised this
about me...

448
00:30:35,853 --> 00:30:38,892
but I'm gay.

449
00:30:38,893 --> 00:30:41,292
I am...

450
00:30:41,293 --> 00:30:42,772
a beautiful

451
00:30:42,773 --> 00:30:44,652
and proud...

452
00:30:44,653 --> 00:30:48,653
gay probation worker.

453
00:30:51,213 --> 00:30:54,733
So am I.

454
00:31:33,413 --> 00:31:37,413
Yeah, but what if she's camouflaged
herself as a pigeon?

455
00:31:38,893 --> 00:31:41,932
You can't camouflage yourself
as a pigeon.

456
00:31:41,933 --> 00:31:44,532
Dimensions are all wrong.

457
00:31:44,533 --> 00:31:46,812
A horse. A donkey.

458
00:31:46,813 --> 00:31:49,492
An alpaca, maybe.

459
00:31:49,493 --> 00:31:53,493
A pigeon... no.

460
00:31:56,933 --> 00:31:59,652
Ow! She stabbed me!

461
00:31:59,653 --> 00:32:02,452
She's fucking stabbed me!

462
00:32:02,453 --> 00:32:05,212
You bitch!

463
00:32:05,213 --> 00:32:08,252
Killer! Bitch! You're swinging.

464
00:32:08,253 --> 00:32:09,492
Fuck!

465
00:32:09,493 --> 00:32:10,812
Fuck! Stop!

466
00:32:10,813 --> 00:32:14,813
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!
Fucking slag!

467
00:32:14,973 --> 00:32:18,973
Oh, God. Oh...

468
00:32:19,333 --> 00:32:22,452
Wasn't her.

469
00:32:22,453 --> 00:32:26,453
Aah!

470
00:32:28,533 --> 00:32:30,812
That's not good. What...?

471
00:32:30,813 --> 00:32:34,813
That's not good.

472
00:32:36,653 --> 00:32:40,653
We're going to find you
and we're going to fucking kill you!

473
00:32:42,173 --> 00:32:44,132
Gargh! No!

474
00:32:44,133 --> 00:32:46,452
You killed Sam. What's that?

475
00:32:46,453 --> 00:32:50,453
You killed Sam!

476
00:32:53,093 --> 00:32:55,812
Whoa, ho-ho-ho-ho! Whoa, dude!

477
00:32:55,813 --> 00:32:57,692
Oh, did you see that?

478
00:32:57,693 --> 00:33:01,172
That's a G-flat, because she's flat
and her fucking name begins with G.

479
00:33:01,173 --> 00:33:05,173
Her name's Karen. Is it?

480
00:33:05,653 --> 00:33:09,653
Wait, wait, wait, wait!
Oh, look, don't, please?

481
00:33:09,733 --> 00:33:11,372
You don't have to be a part of this.

482
00:33:11,373 --> 00:33:13,812
But I am a part of this.
I'm a part of him.

483
00:33:13,813 --> 00:33:15,212
Oh, mate.

484
00:33:15,213 --> 00:33:17,172
But you... Please, just walk away.

485
00:33:17,173 --> 00:33:20,172
Fuck these losers.
They've got it coming.

486
00:33:20,173 --> 00:33:24,173
I'm sorry, but if you're going to kill him,
you're going to have to kill me as well.

487
00:33:24,613 --> 00:33:27,612
You're choosing him over me?

488
00:33:27,613 --> 00:33:29,092
Yeah, I am.

489
00:33:29,093 --> 00:33:32,932
He treated you like shit.

490
00:33:32,933 --> 00:33:34,812
Don't I mean anything to you?

491
00:33:34,813 --> 00:33:37,612
You mean the world to me.

492
00:33:37,613 --> 00:33:40,452
You know you do!
You... You... You betrayed me.

493
00:33:40,453 --> 00:33:44,453
I did not betray you.

494
00:33:48,333 --> 00:33:52,172
I-I know
I haven't always appreciated you.

495
00:33:52,173 --> 00:33:55,652
But the truth is, I feel...

496
00:33:55,653 --> 00:33:57,212
I feel hollow,

497
00:33:57,213 --> 00:34:00,092
like an empty can of Tizer.

498
00:34:00,093 --> 00:34:02,333
You complete me. Huh.

499
00:34:05,413 --> 00:34:06,732
That's Jerry Maguire.

500
00:34:06,733 --> 00:34:09,332
Yeah.

501
00:34:09,333 --> 00:34:12,652
I miss you, dude.

502
00:34:12,653 --> 00:34:16,653
Come 'ere.

503
00:34:27,973 --> 00:34:31,732
Together, we are twice as strong,

504
00:34:31,733 --> 00:34:35,132
we're twice as intelligent and
we're twice as frigging handsome,

505
00:34:35,133 --> 00:34:38,412
and there is fucking nothing
you can do to us.

506
00:34:38,413 --> 00:34:41,892
I can kill you.

507
00:34:41,893 --> 00:34:44,772
Well...

508
00:34:44,773 --> 00:34:48,052
that's just the problem, though,
isn't it, with you electricians?

509
00:34:48,053 --> 00:34:50,132
You just think you can play God,
don't you?

510
00:34:50,133 --> 00:34:54,132
Well, no, sir.

511
00:34:54,133 --> 00:34:56,012
I've got news for you, pal.

512
00:34:56,013 --> 00:35:00,013
People are more complicated
than plugs!

513
00:35:00,213 --> 00:35:03,092
Look at yourself. You just think
everyone's a toaster, don't you?

514
00:35:03,093 --> 00:35:06,212
You're a fucking idiot.

515
00:35:06,213 --> 00:35:10,213
Well, just give it your fucking best
shot, cos I've got rubber soles!

516
00:35:18,493 --> 00:35:20,612
Rudy?

517
00:35:20,613 --> 00:35:22,052
Oh! Come on.

518
00:35:22,053 --> 00:35:23,572
I deliberately pissed myself.

519
00:35:23,573 --> 00:35:27,572
You've just been killed by my weak,
infantile bladder. Ha-ha-ha!

520
00:35:27,573 --> 00:35:31,492
Hah!

521
00:35:31,493 --> 00:35:32,852
Hold in there. We can fix this.

522
00:35:32,853 --> 00:35:34,772
How do we fix it?

523
00:35:34,773 --> 00:35:36,612
Rudy?

524
00:35:36,613 --> 00:35:38,652
Rudy! Oh...

525
00:35:38,653 --> 00:35:41,492
Oh, look at you.

526
00:35:41,493 --> 00:35:43,692
You're so beautiful.

527
00:35:43,693 --> 00:35:45,852
No, no, you...

528
00:35:45,853 --> 00:35:47,932
you can't do this. I need you!

529
00:35:47,933 --> 00:35:50,572
I've got something for you.

530
00:35:50,573 --> 00:35:54,573
I'll just get...

531
00:35:55,773 --> 00:35:57,732
I didn't quite get...

532
00:35:57,733 --> 00:36:00,172
Yeah.

533
00:36:00,173 --> 00:36:01,212
Here, mate.

534
00:36:01,213 --> 00:36:05,213
Nice one.

535
00:36:06,733 --> 00:36:08,252
Three melons!

536
00:36:08,253 --> 00:36:09,932
Oh, God, I've done it.

537
00:36:09,933 --> 00:36:11,172
You've done it.

538
00:36:11,173 --> 00:36:12,972
I've beaten the odds.

539
00:36:12,973 --> 00:36:14,692
Here, give me your hand.

540
00:36:14,693 --> 00:36:18,693
There is a quid on there.

541
00:36:19,133 --> 00:36:23,133
Make sure you look after that baby.

542
00:36:25,933 --> 00:36:27,732
Rudy?

543
00:36:27,733 --> 00:36:31,733
No, no. No, no, no, no.

544
00:36:36,773 --> 00:36:40,773
I think I'm going to be all right.

545
00:36:43,973 --> 00:36:47,973
Rudy?

546
00:36:50,053 --> 00:36:52,016
Rudy?

547
00:36:57,722 --> 00:37:01,722
I should have told him.

548
00:37:01,780 --> 00:37:05,780
I should have told him that I loved
him. Why didn't I tell him?

549
00:37:06,340 --> 00:37:09,139
He knew.

550
00:37:09,140 --> 00:37:11,859
He knew.

551
00:37:11,860 --> 00:37:13,339
Oh, come on.

552
00:37:13,340 --> 00:37:16,219
Sh, sh, sh.

553
00:37:16,220 --> 00:37:19,739
What are you going to do?

554
00:37:19,740 --> 00:37:23,740
I'm going home.

555
00:37:25,900 --> 00:37:29,900
Come on.

556
00:37:52,260 --> 00:37:56,260
There you go.

557
00:38:01,860 --> 00:38:05,860
I'm doing this for you.

558
00:38:12,300 --> 00:38:15,499
Hi.

559
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:17,420
It's me.

560
00:38:22,140 --> 00:38:26,140
Jess?

561
00:38:34,340 --> 00:38:38,340
Jess?

562
00:38:47,060 --> 00:38:48,099
Jess?

563
00:38:48,100 --> 00:38:49,219
Jess!

564
00:38:49,220 --> 00:38:50,379
No!

565
00:38:50,380 --> 00:38:52,459
No, no. No, no, no. Jess?

566
00:38:52,460 --> 00:38:55,059
No, no. You can't do this.

567
00:38:55,060 --> 00:38:56,779
I won't let you.

568
00:38:56,780 --> 00:39:00,780
You're mine.

569
00:39:02,140 --> 00:39:03,979
Scratchcard.

570
00:39:03,980 --> 00:39:06,979
That's genius.
Why didn't I think of that?

571
00:39:06,980 --> 00:39:10,860
Well, not everyone's as blessed in the brains
and trouser department as I am, are they?

572
00:39:17,540 --> 00:39:19,739
'Hi, it's me.

573
00:39:19,740 --> 00:39:23,259
'Listen carefully, because there's
some things that you need to know.

574
00:39:23,260 --> 00:39:26,139
'I know this sounds weird, but...

575
00:39:26,140 --> 00:39:27,899
'..you're gonna have a baby.

576
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:31,459
'Oh, he's beautiful.

577
00:39:31,460 --> 00:39:35,460
'Listen. You're gonna meet this guy.
His name's Luke.'

578
00:39:36,860 --> 00:39:40,860
Can I buy you a drink?

579
00:39:47,340 --> 00:39:48,819
'You have to have sex with him,

580
00:39:48,820 --> 00:39:52,820
'or the baby will never exist.'

581
00:39:54,900 --> 00:39:56,579
We'll always be together.

582
00:39:56,580 --> 00:39:59,580
'But Luke is a psycho.'

583
00:40:06,380 --> 00:40:07,859
'After you have sex with him,

584
00:40:07,860 --> 00:40:09,699
'you have to kill him,

585
00:40:09,700 --> 00:40:13,700
'or he will never let you go.'

586
00:40:27,900 --> 00:40:30,899
'Rudy loves you and your baby.

587
00:40:30,900 --> 00:40:34,900
'So stop being such a stubborn bitch
and forgive him.'

588
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:49,860
'Don't fuck it up.'

589
00:40:50,940 --> 00:40:54,940
What's going on?

590
00:40:55,660 --> 00:40:58,579
Do you know, I honestly thought...

591
00:40:58,580 --> 00:41:01,779
I thought I could do something...

592
00:41:01,780 --> 00:41:04,899
achieve something on me own.

593
00:41:04,900 --> 00:41:06,979
Honestly, what an idiot.

594
00:41:06,980 --> 00:41:10,980
Hey, what... what
are you talking about?

595
00:41:12,220 --> 00:41:14,020
Jess has just come back from the
future.

596
00:41:15,460 --> 00:41:18,699
And she said this whole superhero
thing, it just...

597
00:41:18,700 --> 00:41:20,379
it gets completely out of control.

598
00:41:20,380 --> 00:41:24,380
I mean, you... you end up
killing people, lots of 'em.

599
00:41:24,940 --> 00:41:28,940
And then we all die...

600
00:41:29,140 --> 00:41:31,459
horribly.

601
00:41:31,460 --> 00:41:35,460
This is what happens when you base your
future around a jumper, for God's sake!

602
00:41:37,580 --> 00:41:40,099
Frigging knitwear!

603
00:41:40,100 --> 00:41:44,100
Hey.

604
00:41:45,020 --> 00:41:48,339
Maybe...

605
00:41:48,340 --> 00:41:52,340
we should go travelling
together instead.

606
00:41:52,660 --> 00:41:55,099
Me and you.

607
00:41:55,100 --> 00:41:57,379
Really?

608
00:41:57,380 --> 00:42:01,380
I'd like that.

609
00:42:18,780 --> 00:42:20,419
Here's to the future.

610
00:42:20,420 --> 00:42:24,099
Oh, about the future. I've just been.

611
00:42:24,100 --> 00:42:25,859
Am I a shepherd?

612
00:42:25,860 --> 00:42:29,179
Erm... you are...

613
00:42:29,180 --> 00:42:31,579
holding a golf sale sign

614
00:42:31,580 --> 00:42:34,499
for a golf sale that doesn't exist.

615
00:42:34,500 --> 00:42:37,979
You're still working behind the bar.

616
00:42:37,980 --> 00:42:40,379
And you...

617
00:42:40,380 --> 00:42:41,979
are a trainee probation worker.

618
00:42:41,980 --> 00:42:43,459
Fuck off.

619
00:42:43,460 --> 00:42:47,460
Jess, honest? Shame on you, Finlay!
Deep humiliating shame.

620
00:42:47,860 --> 00:42:49,459
I'm a multimillionaire, aren't I?

621
00:42:49,460 --> 00:42:50,659
You... No, no, no.

622
00:42:50,660 --> 00:42:53,419
Don't tell me, don't tell me.
I want it to be a surprise.

623
00:42:53,420 --> 00:42:55,299
Wink twice for yes.

624
00:42:55,300 --> 00:42:59,300
You win a quid, piss yourself
and then you get electrocuted.

625
00:43:00,660 --> 00:43:03,219
Colour me disappointed.

626
00:43:03,220 --> 00:43:05,099
I'm just saying, unless we want
to spend

627
00:43:05,100 --> 00:43:07,779
the rest of our lives
as these underachieving fuck-ups,

628
00:43:07,780 --> 00:43:10,179
then maybe we should think about
doing something with our powers.

629
00:43:10,180 --> 00:43:13,139
What, you mean like open up
a fast-food restaurant?

630
00:43:13,140 --> 00:43:16,619
No. I mean like becoming proper
superheroes,

631
00:43:16,620 --> 00:43:18,819
good ones, that do good shit.

632
00:43:18,820 --> 00:43:21,259
Superheroes.

633
00:43:21,260 --> 00:43:23,099
I'm up for that.
I might have to make

634
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:25,379
a few modifications,
just on me costume.

635
00:43:25,380 --> 00:43:28,899
It's just on account of me...
I've got irritable bowel syndrome.

636
00:43:28,900 --> 00:43:31,979
And shitting in Lycra
is how I got banned from the gym.

637
00:43:31,980 --> 00:43:34,899
No offence, but you lot...

638
00:43:34,900 --> 00:43:37,739
superheroes?!

639
00:43:37,740 --> 00:43:40,459
Fuck it.

640
00:43:40,460 --> 00:43:43,019
All right, yeah, let's do it.

641
00:43:43,020 --> 00:43:47,020
This could be the start
of something huge.

642
00:43:47,860 --> 00:43:50,314
I feel it in me nutsack.

643
