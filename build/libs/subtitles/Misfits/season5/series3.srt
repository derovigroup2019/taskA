It was never just about that.

537
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:31,593
But you're right.

538
00:43:31,640 --> 00:43:36,157
It's like going down on your mum,
or your sister, at least.

539
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:38,873
Maybe your favourite aunt.

540
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:46,234
Right.

541
00:43:46,280 --> 00:43:49,113
I've got to go to community service.

542
00:43:52,760 --> 00:43:54,876
I'm really glad I made you.

543
00:43:58,240 --> 00:43:59,913

Whoa! No, no, no. I need to talk to ya!

It's about a jumper.

559
00:45:48,680 --> 00:45:51,513
Rudy 2's buggered off and left me.

560
00:45:51,560 --> 00:45:53,471
You all right, mate? How're you doing?

561
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:56,194
Oh, shit! It's him.

562
00:45:56,240 --> 00:45:59,073
Jesus Christ,
the man's a fucking vegetable.

563

He's not some random old man.
He's Rudy <i>2</i> and he's a part of you.

- I don't know.

Well, it's you.

00:46:16,120 --> 00:46:18,555
D'you know what?
If I wasn't such a total fuck-up,

569
00:46:18,600 --> 00:46:20,910
I'd probably ask you out for a drink.
