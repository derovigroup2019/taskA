1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,939
It's a man. He's trapped in here.

2
00:00:01,968 --> 00:00:05,968
If you want to be with me
then we have to tell Finn.

3
00:00:07,368 --> 00:00:09,567
You are to become an agent of Satan.

4
00:00:09,568 --> 00:00:11,287
Meam tenebris.

5
00:00:11,288 --> 00:00:13,888
I've got the power to fuck

6
00:00:13,984 --> 00:00:15,704
powers out of people.

7
00:00:15,704 --> 00:00:18,184
I cause accidents.

8
00:00:18,184 --> 00:00:19,744
Your mate said you'd take my power.

9
00:00:19,744 --> 00:00:21,484
Use your power, Alex.

10
00:00:21,532 --> 00:00:24,651
Be a superhero.

11
00:00:50,302 --> 00:00:52,601
You're Alex, aren't you?
Mm-hm.

12
00:00:52,602 --> 00:00:53,801
I need you to take my power.

13
00:00:53,860 --> 00:00:56,859
Is that right?
And what power might that be?

14
00:00:56,860 --> 00:01:00,140
I've got hypnotic tits.

15
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:06,340
Can we just get this over with?

16
00:01:24,931 --> 00:01:28,931
Is that it? Did it work?

17
00:01:31,851 --> 00:01:35,851
Yeah, yeah, I guess it did.

18
00:01:36,811 --> 00:01:40,811
Um, I didn't get your name. That's
because I didn't give it to you.

19
00:01:41,131 --> 00:01:42,850
Well, do you want to stay
for a drink?

20
00:01:42,851 --> 00:01:45,731
I know you're supposed to have the
drink before you shag, but, er...

21
00:01:45,769 --> 00:01:47,928
Or can I just get your number?
Because then I thought

22
00:01:47,980 --> 00:01:51,099
it would be nice if we could...
if we could see each other again.

23
00:01:54,150 --> 00:02:33,916

<font color="#3399CC">http://UKsubtitles.ru.</font>

24
00:02:38,946 --> 00:02:42,105
Everyone, we've got
an announcement to make.

25
00:02:42,106 --> 00:02:46,106
So tomorrow's the one-year
anniversary of the storm.

26
00:02:46,386 --> 00:02:48,945
Thus it is my birthday.

27
00:02:48,946 --> 00:02:52,025
And mine. I'm gonna be one.
Well, that's just fucking weird.

28
00:02:52,026 --> 00:02:54,245
Well, we've having a party
here at the Community Centre

29
00:02:54,339 --> 00:02:55,458
and you're all invited.

30
00:02:55,598 --> 00:02:58,317
Question.
Yes, there'll be a buffet.

31
00:02:58,318 --> 00:03:01,157
I accept your invitation.

32
00:03:01,158 --> 00:03:03,997
So it's going to be like
a normal first birthday party

33
00:03:03,998 --> 00:03:07,137
but instead of pass the parcel
and little paper hats,

34
00:03:07,211 --> 00:03:11,050
there'll be vodka and drugs
and people fucking each other.

35
00:03:11,051 --> 00:03:12,810
Ah! Mm-mm.

36
00:03:12,811 --> 00:03:14,050
Yeah.

37
00:03:14,051 --> 00:03:16,650
Helen'll be there. I just...

38
00:03:16,651 --> 00:03:19,090
I really want you to meet her, man.
Please come.

39
00:03:19,091 --> 00:03:22,730
Yeah, all right. I might pop down.

40
00:03:22,731 --> 00:03:24,410
I'll have a sausage roll.

41
00:03:24,411 --> 00:03:26,730
You have got sausage rolls,
haven't you?

42
00:03:26,731 --> 00:03:29,770
Fuck's sake!
I'll get the sausage rolls.

43
00:03:29,771 --> 00:03:33,771
OK.

44
00:03:34,931 --> 00:03:38,931
Oh, yeah.

45
00:03:40,651 --> 00:03:42,850
I am...

46
00:03:42,851 --> 00:03:45,370
..looking for a girl.

47
00:03:45,371 --> 00:03:49,371
I think she might have been
at your support group.

48
00:03:54,731 --> 00:03:57,370
Finlay! My child!

49
00:03:57,371 --> 00:04:00,370
Please, I insist. Anything you want.

50
00:04:00,371 --> 00:04:02,210
Anything up to the value of...

51
00:04:02,211 --> 00:04:04,890
60 whole English pennies, dude.

52
00:04:04,891 --> 00:04:07,850
Now, may I suggest E7?
That is the Bounty bar.

53
00:04:07,851 --> 00:04:09,450
Truly is a tropical taste sensation.

54
00:04:09,451 --> 00:04:11,490
Why are you being so nice to me?

55
00:04:11,491 --> 00:04:14,410
No rea... Dude, what the f...?
When did you get so cynical?

56
00:04:14,411 --> 00:04:16,890
Whatever happened
to me bright-eyed little sunbeam,

57
00:04:16,891 --> 00:04:20,891
with his little hatful of hope there?

58
00:04:22,891 --> 00:04:26,370
The reason is I'm going...
I'm going out with Jess.

59
00:04:26,371 --> 00:04:28,890
I've said it.

60
00:04:28,891 --> 00:04:29,970
I'm sorry, man.

61
00:04:29,971 --> 00:04:32,890
You think that's funny?
Dude, I'm not joking, Finn.

62
00:04:32,891 --> 00:04:35,370
We are. We're boyfriend
and girlfriend, Finn. We...

63
00:04:35,371 --> 00:04:39,170
We fuck and stuff and spoon.
We're shagging. We're fuck spoons.

64
00:04:39,171 --> 00:04:43,171
Did you really think
I was going to fall for that?!

65
00:04:43,571 --> 00:04:45,370
Fuck's sake.

66
00:04:45,371 --> 00:04:49,371
Jess likes pretty boys, like me...

67
00:04:49,771 --> 00:04:52,250
..and Alex. Just...
You're not her type, mate,

68
00:04:52,251 --> 00:04:54,130
trust me. Unbelievable!

69
00:04:54,131 --> 00:04:56,210
Unbe-frigging...! Fuck you, dude.

70
00:04:56,211 --> 00:04:57,730
Snack revoked.

71
00:04:57,731 --> 00:05:01,370
You'll have to buy
your own Bounty bar, dickhead.

72
00:05:01,371 --> 00:05:05,371
I will. Do.

73
00:05:18,371 --> 00:05:19,650
What are you doing here?

74
00:05:19,651 --> 00:05:23,651
You forgot to say thank you.
For what?

75
00:05:24,371 --> 00:05:28,050
For, um... helping you out.

76
00:05:28,051 --> 00:05:31,010
The way I see it,
we both got what we wanted.

77
00:05:31,011 --> 00:05:34,530
I got rid of my power
and you got an easy fuck.

78
00:05:34,531 --> 00:05:36,650
Right, OK. So that's...

79
00:05:36,651 --> 00:05:38,130
That's what you think I'm about?

80
00:05:38,131 --> 00:05:40,690
I just go around just...

81
00:05:40,691 --> 00:05:44,250
..shagging anything that moves
for the fun of it.

82
00:05:44,251 --> 00:05:46,610
I don't know what you're about.

83
00:05:46,611 --> 00:05:49,850
Look, I... I've had sex with men...

84
00:05:49,851 --> 00:05:52,410
..girls that were...
Oh, well, she was battered,

85
00:05:52,411 --> 00:05:54,490
covered in blood,

86
00:05:54,491 --> 00:05:57,810
and, look, all I'm trying to do
is just help people.

87
00:05:57,811 --> 00:05:59,370
Wow, you're all heart!

88
00:05:59,371 --> 00:06:03,210
So you are just going to use me
and walk away, then?

89
00:06:03,211 --> 00:06:07,211
There's a party at
the Community Centre tomorrow night.

90
00:06:07,811 --> 00:06:10,730
Give me a chance.

91
00:06:10,731 --> 00:06:12,970
I appreciate what you did for me,
all right?

92
00:06:12,971 --> 00:06:15,130
Thank you,
if that's what you need to hear.

93
00:06:15,131 --> 00:06:16,930
But I don't owe you anything.

94
00:06:16,931 --> 00:06:20,931
So leave me alone.

95
00:06:26,531 --> 00:06:29,090
You are still coming, aren't you,
to the party?

96
00:06:29,091 --> 00:06:31,090
I told you, mate. I'll be there.

97
00:06:31,091 --> 00:06:33,130
Yeah, I know,
but it's just a bit of a big deal.

98
00:06:33,131 --> 00:06:36,530
It's the first time we're all gonna be
in the same place at the same time.

99
00:06:36,531 --> 00:06:40,370
You know, the, er... the, er...

100
00:06:40,371 --> 00:06:41,570
..the Jumper Posse.

101
00:06:41,571 --> 00:06:44,050
Mate, that has got to be
the worst fucking name

102
00:06:44,051 --> 00:06:45,970
for a gang of superheroes
I've ever heard.

103
00:06:45,971 --> 00:06:49,971
Oh, just... We'll work on it.

104
00:06:54,531 --> 00:06:58,531
Wait!

105
00:07:06,251 --> 00:07:08,490
Addiction...

106
00:07:08,491 --> 00:07:09,730
..is a weakness.

107
00:07:09,731 --> 00:07:13,731
And weakness must be stamped upon.

108
00:07:16,931 --> 00:07:19,290
Oh, no, it's... It's not all for me.

109
00:07:19,291 --> 00:07:20,610
It's my birthday.

110
00:07:20,611 --> 00:07:22,170
Oh! We're having a party.

111
00:07:22,171 --> 00:07:23,650
Oh! You're having a party?

112
00:07:23,651 --> 00:07:27,651
Yeah. In my Community Centre?

113
00:07:29,091 --> 00:07:32,210
Am I invited?

114
00:07:32,211 --> 00:07:33,250
N-No.

115
00:07:33,251 --> 00:07:35,210
No, you're right.

116
00:07:35,211 --> 00:07:39,211
I mean, why would you want some
miserable old cunt hanging around...

117
00:07:39,371 --> 00:07:41,250
..spoiling all your fun?

118
00:07:41,251 --> 00:07:45,251
Well, it's not as if we're friends.
We're not fucking friends.

119
00:07:46,011 --> 00:07:50,011
Probation Worker, are you saying
you'd like to come to our party?

120
00:07:51,931 --> 00:07:55,250
Would you like me
to come to your party?

121
00:07:55,251 --> 00:07:56,490
Yeah.

122
00:07:56,491 --> 00:07:58,370
What time does it start?
About nine.

123
00:07:58,371 --> 00:07:59,651
See you about nine, then.

124
00:08:24,851 --> 00:08:26,810
Are you all right?
Here he is.

125
00:08:26,811 --> 00:08:30,610
I just... I wanted to talk to you before
everyone else gets here, that's all.

126
00:08:30,611 --> 00:08:34,570
Here, before you start
waffling on...

127
00:08:34,571 --> 00:08:38,571
..I got you a present. Have ya?

128
00:08:39,411 --> 00:08:43,411
What is it? Have a look.

129
00:08:43,731 --> 00:08:45,010
Eh?

130
00:08:45,011 --> 00:08:48,050
It's a pill. Yeah.

131
00:08:48,051 --> 00:08:51,530
Well, shit, man. Apparently my
dealer doesn't do book tokens, so...

132
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:53,850
? Ta-da! ?
You know I don't do drugs.

133
00:08:53,851 --> 00:08:56,330
Oh, yeah! Shit!

134
00:08:56,331 --> 00:08:58,410
No point in wasting that, then,
is there?

135
00:08:58,411 --> 00:09:01,170
Did you even get me a card?
Did you get me... anything?

136
00:09:01,171 --> 00:09:02,690
No, I didn't get you a birthday card

137
00:09:02,691 --> 00:09:05,090
because today isn't actually
your real birthday, is it?

138
00:09:05,091 --> 00:09:07,810
January 7th - that is our birthday.

139
00:09:07,811 --> 00:09:11,650
No, that's YOUR birthday, isn't it?

140
00:09:11,651 --> 00:09:15,651
Today. Today is my birthday.

141
00:09:16,851 --> 00:09:18,450
Now, just...

142
00:09:18,451 --> 00:09:22,451
I've been thinking about this
a lot and...

143
00:09:23,891 --> 00:09:25,770
I think we need to split up.

144
00:09:25,771 --> 00:09:28,850
Now, we're spending
more and more time apart.

145
00:09:28,851 --> 00:09:32,290
You know, since I met Helen...

146
00:09:32,291 --> 00:09:36,291
..I feel more confident in meself,
you know, and who I wanna be.

147
00:09:37,811 --> 00:09:41,770
You know, I just...
I hope we can still be friends.

148
00:09:41,771 --> 00:09:43,210
I just... I just... I do,

149
00:09:43,211 --> 00:09:47,211
and I need to stand on my own
two feet now. I need to...

150
00:09:48,531 --> 00:09:52,290
I need to be me own person.

151
00:09:52,291 --> 00:09:54,930
Shit, yeah!

152
00:09:54,931 --> 00:09:56,290
Of course. Of course you do.

153
00:09:56,291 --> 00:09:59,370
Yeah. Well, you'll be fine.
You'll be all right.

154
00:09:59,371 --> 00:10:03,371
Yeah. You... You'll be fine.
You'll be fine.

155
00:10:03,571 --> 00:10:06,810
Happy birthday. Eh?

156
00:10:06,811 --> 00:10:08,345
Yeah.

157
00:10:23,767 --> 00:10:25,886
Is this it?

158
00:10:26,016 --> 00:10:27,255
Maybe.

159
00:10:27,256 --> 00:10:30,495
At least you lot are here.

160
00:10:30,496 --> 00:10:31,815
And Mark.

161
00:10:31,816 --> 00:10:34,256
Oh, well,
it's all about Mark, isn't it?

162
00:10:34,352 --> 00:10:36,831
Cos he can really make or break
a party, can't he - Mark?

163
00:10:36,832 --> 00:10:39,231
Fucking hell! Oh, my God!

164
00:10:39,232 --> 00:10:41,631
What the fuck is he doing
here, dude?!

165
00:10:41,632 --> 00:10:43,911
Oh, yeah, I invited the
probation worker.

166
00:10:43,912 --> 00:10:44,991
But why?!

167
00:10:44,992 --> 00:10:48,992
Great! Just when you think
the party can't get any shitter!

168
00:10:49,192 --> 00:10:51,671
Fuck it. I'm just going to get
this shit out of the way.

169
00:10:51,672 --> 00:10:53,911
I've got you all a present, actually, cos
it's been one year since the storm.

170
00:10:53,912 --> 00:10:57,231
Here you are, dude.
Here you are, love. Finlay.

171
00:10:57,232 --> 00:10:58,271
Abs.

172
00:10:58,272 --> 00:10:59,831
It's a pill.

173
00:10:59,832 --> 00:11:01,831
And no, I didn't get a fucking gift
receipt,

174
00:11:01,832 --> 00:11:04,071
so happy anniversary, you
dickheads.

175
00:11:04,072 --> 00:11:06,111
What is wrong with you,
Little Miss Sunshine?!

176
00:11:06,112 --> 00:11:09,231
Nothing, actually.
I'm having a great time!

177
00:11:09,232 --> 00:11:12,592
I'm going to go for a drink for everybody.
Do you want a drink? I'll get you a drink.

178
00:11:23,992 --> 00:11:25,511
You came.
Oh, yeah,

179
00:11:25,512 --> 00:11:26,991
I was coming anyway.

180
00:11:26,992 --> 00:11:29,271
I'm here with my friends
from the support group.

181
00:11:29,272 --> 00:11:31,031
Yeah.

182
00:11:31,032 --> 00:11:32,831
Right. Yeah, obviously.

183
00:11:32,832 --> 00:11:34,311
Um...

184
00:11:34,312 --> 00:11:35,911
well, um...

185
00:11:35,912 --> 00:11:38,032
So have a good night.

186
00:11:41,112 --> 00:11:45,112
Hiya, I'm Abby - the birthday
girl.

187
00:11:49,352 --> 00:11:52,351
All right?

188
00:11:52,352 --> 00:11:53,391
All right?
Hiya.

189
00:11:53,392 --> 00:11:55,111
This is, um...

190
00:11:55,112 --> 00:11:56,791
Helen.

191
00:11:56,792 --> 00:11:58,591
You're Rudy 1.

192
00:11:58,592 --> 00:11:59,991
Rudy.

193
00:11:59,992 --> 00:12:02,591
It's just Rudy.

194
00:12:02,592 --> 00:12:05,951
Should be a good night, eh?
Doubt it, dude.

195
00:12:05,952 --> 00:12:07,711
Don't usually throw parties.

196
00:12:07,712 --> 00:12:09,951
Long story short -
we shat ourselves.

197
00:12:09,952 --> 00:12:11,951
On a bouncy castle. Got a bit
messy. Do you remember?

198
00:12:11,952 --> 00:12:14,031
Mum and Dad lost the deposit.

199
00:12:14,032 --> 00:12:15,951
I'm sure he'll tell you all about
it, won't you, mate?

200
00:12:15,952 --> 00:12:18,711
It wasn't that
bad. I forgot to say...

201
00:12:18,712 --> 00:12:22,231
happy birthday!
Did you?

202
00:12:22,232 --> 00:12:23,751
Oh, come on!

203
00:12:23,752 --> 00:12:24,911
Oh!

204
00:12:24,912 --> 00:12:26,471
I'm, er...

205
00:12:26,472 --> 00:12:30,472
I'm just gonna go and see if any of
the others are here, all right? Yeah?

206
00:12:33,512 --> 00:12:34,551
Oi!

207
00:12:34,552 --> 00:12:36,871
D'you know, this is your fuckin'
fault, this is?

208
00:12:36,872 --> 00:12:39,431
Eh? You're filling his head
wi' all these big ideas.

209
00:12:39,432 --> 00:12:40,631
He's going off being his own
person,

210
00:12:40,632 --> 00:12:43,431
doing his own fuckin' thing. D'you
know what you're doing?

211
00:12:43,432 --> 00:12:45,711
You're trying to split up the band.

212
00:12:45,712 --> 00:12:48,831
Me and him are the fuckin'
Beatles, mate,

213
00:12:48,832 --> 00:12:51,511
and you're just that
yodelling Chinese... woman.

214
00:12:51,512 --> 00:12:52,711
Yoko Ono? Yeah.

215
00:12:52,712 --> 00:12:54,511
She's Japanese. Is she?

216
00:12:54,512 --> 00:12:57,351
Yeah? Well, when it all goes
fuckin' tits up

217
00:12:57,352 --> 00:12:59,871
it'll be me that he comes
running back to, won't it,

218
00:12:59,872 --> 00:13:02,311
with his tiny little penis
between his legs?

219
00:13:02,312 --> 00:13:03,351
Look,

220
00:13:03,352 --> 00:13:06,431
we're together,
and if you can't deal with that

221
00:13:06,432 --> 00:13:09,671
then I guess you'll just have to go
fuck yourself.

222
00:13:09,672 --> 00:13:11,911
Oh, you fuckin'...
I can't find...

223
00:13:11,912 --> 00:13:12,991
Here he is!

224
00:13:12,992 --> 00:13:15,351
I can't... I can't find 'em.

225
00:13:15,352 --> 00:13:16,831
I'll help you find them.

226
00:13:16,832 --> 00:13:20,711
See ya later, Rudy 1.
See you in a bit.

227
00:13:20,712 --> 00:13:23,671
Fuck's sake!

228
00:13:23,672 --> 00:13:27,511
He is. He... He's leaving me.

229
00:13:27,512 --> 00:13:30,151
And I mean for good this time.
He wants to be wi' Helen.

230
00:13:30,152 --> 00:13:34,152
It's like leaving home, innit?
It was always going to happen one day.

231
00:13:38,112 --> 00:13:41,951
Do you know what is a really
good cure for a bad mood?

232
00:13:41,952 --> 00:13:43,351
No.

233
00:13:43,352 --> 00:13:47,352
Magic beans. Uh?

234
00:13:47,712 --> 00:13:51,712
Ooh! See? I feel better
already. Mm.

235
00:13:51,992 --> 00:13:54,752
No, mate. I'll have it later
or summat.

236
00:14:00,832 --> 00:14:03,951
Look...

237
00:14:03,952 --> 00:14:05,871
I do get it.

238
00:14:05,872 --> 00:14:07,271
You're scared because he's going

239
00:14:07,272 --> 00:14:09,071
and you don't want to be
on your own, do you?

240
00:14:09,072 --> 00:14:10,951
No.

241
00:14:10,952 --> 00:14:12,591
You're not going to be on your
own.

242
00:14:12,592 --> 00:14:14,671
You know why?

243
00:14:14,672 --> 00:14:16,671
Cos I got you.

244
00:14:16,672 --> 00:14:20,672
Yes. It's because you've got
me, you miserable prick.

245
00:14:27,992 --> 00:14:29,231
Oh, shit!

246
00:14:29,232 --> 00:14:32,591
That's not how it looked, Finn,
cos, um...

247
00:14:32,592 --> 00:14:34,511
It is, actually.
It is exactly how it looked.

248
00:14:34,512 --> 00:14:38,512
And I'm sorry, dude,
cos I've been try... Finn! Finn!

249
00:14:45,872 --> 00:14:49,872
Sorry, mate.

250
00:14:54,272 --> 00:14:55,351
No worries, mate.

251
00:14:55,352 --> 00:14:57,951
I don't think they're coming.
They said they'd be here.

252
00:14:57,952 --> 00:15:01,351
If they can't even be bothered to
show up on time, they can both fuck off.

253
00:15:01,352 --> 00:15:03,471
Nice!

254
00:15:03,472 --> 00:15:04,991
Who are you?

255
00:15:04,992 --> 00:15:07,351
I'm the one
that you just told to fuck off.

256
00:15:07,352 --> 00:15:08,911
Who are you?

257
00:15:08,912 --> 00:15:12,551
Er, this is Helen. It's the one I was
telling you about.

258
00:15:12,552 --> 00:15:15,071
Congratulations, mate.
She's a charmer!

259
00:15:15,072 --> 00:15:17,271
We're just... We're just waiting on
Karen now.

260
00:15:17,272 --> 00:15:19,911
She should be here any
minute, running a bit late.

261
00:15:19,912 --> 00:15:22,911
I'm here.

262
00:15:22,912 --> 00:15:25,671
Oh, my God!
Have you been spying on us?

263
00:15:25,672 --> 00:15:29,231
No, I just... I got here early.

264
00:15:29,232 --> 00:15:31,511
I didn't want people to see me
hanging round on my own.

265
00:15:31,512 --> 00:15:32,911
What did she say?

266
00:15:32,912 --> 00:15:34,591
I wasn't spying on you.

267
00:15:34,592 --> 00:15:36,671
I can't understand what she's
saying.

268
00:15:36,672 --> 00:15:39,831
She said she wasn't spying on you.

269
00:15:39,832 --> 00:15:42,151
Er, Karen...

270
00:15:42,152 --> 00:15:45,031
do you want to tell them about
your power?

271
00:15:45,032 --> 00:15:48,991
I can blend into my
surroundings.

272
00:15:48,992 --> 00:15:50,071
Hide in plain sight.

273
00:15:50,072 --> 00:15:52,991
We'll have to sort out subtitles or
something, cos I can't hear a word of it.

274
00:15:52,992 --> 00:15:55,391
Let's... Come on, let's go and...
Let's go and have a drink, guys.

275
00:15:55,392 --> 00:15:57,192
Do you want a drink? Come
on, Karen.

276
00:16:10,112 --> 00:16:12,151
You fuckin' lied to me.

277
00:16:12,152 --> 00:16:14,591
Dude, I didn't, man. Technically
that's inaccurate, cos I...

278
00:16:14,592 --> 00:16:16,671
I fuckin' offered to buy you a
Bounty bar,

279
00:16:16,672 --> 00:16:19,111
for God's sake. I was telling
you the truth. You just...

280
00:16:19,112 --> 00:16:21,271
You just... You didn't believe
me, Finn.

281
00:16:21,272 --> 00:16:22,911
And d'you know why?

282
00:16:22,912 --> 00:16:24,951
Because I didn't think
you'd do that to me.

283
00:16:24,952 --> 00:16:27,511
Come on, man. Don't be like this.
Come to Uncle Rudy for a bit.

284
00:16:27,512 --> 00:16:29,631
Don't think that
you can just laugh it off.

285
00:16:29,632 --> 00:16:32,231
Fuck me over
and then make a joke out of it.

286
00:16:32,232 --> 00:16:35,271
And you know what?

287
00:16:35,272 --> 00:16:39,272
I know you probably won't give a shit,
because you've got Jess now.

288
00:16:39,432 --> 00:16:41,791
But as far as friendship goes,

289
00:16:41,792 --> 00:16:43,831
you and me -

290
00:16:43,832 --> 00:16:45,111
we're finished.

291
00:16:45,112 --> 00:16:47,991
Enjoy the fuckin' party.

292
00:16:47,992 --> 00:16:49,351
Finn?

293
00:16:49,352 --> 00:16:51,791
Fuck!

294
00:16:51,792 --> 00:16:55,792
Fuck's sake.

295
00:17:01,712 --> 00:17:05,591
Relax. I am... I am not following
you. I just came to get some air.

296
00:17:05,592 --> 00:17:06,711
Is that...? Is that all right?

297
00:17:06,712 --> 00:17:10,551
Be my guest.

298
00:17:10,552 --> 00:17:13,391
Sorry about the other day.

299
00:17:13,392 --> 00:17:15,511
It's just this year has been...

300
00:17:15,512 --> 00:17:18,311
a fucking nightmare -

301
00:17:18,312 --> 00:17:21,031
the power thing.

302
00:17:21,032 --> 00:17:23,351
I had to stop seeing my dad.

303
00:17:23,352 --> 00:17:25,711
He just couldn't stop staring
at them.

304
00:17:25,712 --> 00:17:27,871
Oh, shit, mate!

305
00:17:27,872 --> 00:17:31,431
Oh, I didn't even think about that.

306
00:17:31,432 --> 00:17:34,431
Nobody needs their dad
staring at their tits, do they?

307
00:17:34,432 --> 00:17:38,432
No.

308
00:17:39,712 --> 00:17:43,712
D'you wanna go and get a drink?

309
00:17:44,352 --> 00:17:45,591
What kind of a drink?

310
00:17:45,592 --> 00:17:48,871
Like a date drink, or a drink
drink?

311
00:17:48,872 --> 00:17:52,872
Well, I was just thinking...
a drink with alcohol in.

312
00:17:53,232 --> 00:17:55,191
All right.

313
00:17:55,192 --> 00:17:59,192
But it isn't a date.
All right, fine. It's not a date.

314
00:18:18,352 --> 00:18:19,871
Rudy 1 or Rudy 2?

315
00:18:19,872 --> 00:18:21,031
It's Rudy!

316
00:18:21,032 --> 00:18:22,711
It's just Rudy!

317
00:18:22,712 --> 00:18:24,751
I'm Ghostbusters,
he's Ghostbusters II,

318
00:18:24,752 --> 00:18:27,871
and everybody knows Ghostbusters II
was a right piece of shit.

319
00:18:27,872 --> 00:18:29,191
I quite liked it.

320
00:18:29,192 --> 00:18:30,751
You fucking would, wouldn't you?

321
00:18:30,752 --> 00:18:34,752
Do you know ecstasy
reverses your power?

322
00:18:35,032 --> 00:18:39,032
Whatever your power is,
it makes it do the opposite.

323
00:18:40,192 --> 00:18:41,871
That's a good fact.

324
00:18:41,872 --> 00:18:45,872
All right, stay off the pills,
stick to the friggin' heroin, then!

325
00:18:45,952 --> 00:18:48,352
Oh, fuck! Jess! Shit!

326
00:19:12,432 --> 00:19:14,311
Abby! Abby! Have you seen Jess?

327
00:19:14,312 --> 00:19:16,191
No. Fuck!

328
00:19:16,192 --> 00:19:17,711
Have you taken your pill?

329
00:19:17,712 --> 00:19:19,711
No, I was going to have it
with a bit of cake later.

330
00:19:19,712 --> 00:19:23,351
No, no, you do not take the friggin' pill.
It'll reverse all your powers.

331
00:19:23,352 --> 00:19:27,352
Cake? Fuckin' cake?!

332
00:19:40,152 --> 00:19:41,671
What the fuck?!

333
00:19:41,672 --> 00:19:44,231
I can't see.

334
00:19:44,232 --> 00:19:48,232
I can't fucking s... see.

335
00:19:52,752 --> 00:19:56,071
Rudy!

336
00:19:56,072 --> 00:19:58,191
Some... Someone?

337
00:19:58,192 --> 00:20:00,751
My mate...

338
00:20:00,752 --> 00:20:02,911
...he got turned into an agent
of Satan

339
00:20:02,912 --> 00:20:04,551
nd I had to fuck him in the arse.

340
00:20:04,552 --> 00:20:05,831
Oh, nice!

341
00:20:05,832 --> 00:20:07,151
Yeah.

342
00:20:07,152 --> 00:20:10,671
Oh, and I almost, almost
shagged a tortoise once.

343
00:20:10,672 --> 00:20:13,191
So, you do draw the line
at shagging animals?

344
00:20:13,192 --> 00:20:17,192
Good to know.

345
00:20:18,632 --> 00:20:21,151
Er, so, you, are you...

346
00:20:21,152 --> 00:20:23,151
seeing anyone...

347
00:20:23,152 --> 00:20:24,191
at the moment?

348
00:20:24,192 --> 00:20:26,111
Or...?

349
00:20:26,112 --> 00:20:28,351
Well, when I had my power,

350
00:20:28,352 --> 00:20:32,352
it was kinda hard to tell the
good guys from the wankers

351
00:20:33,632 --> 00:20:36,791
and there have been a lot of
wankers.

352
00:20:36,792 --> 00:20:40,792
Yeah.

353
00:20:52,312 --> 00:20:53,511
Problem?

354
00:20:53,512 --> 00:20:55,991
Oh, God! Sorry.

355
00:20:55,992 --> 00:20:57,871
Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry!

356
00:20:57,872 --> 00:21:01,872
Er, it's just now that I know I'm
not supposed to look at them...

357
00:21:01,952 --> 00:21:03,511
..all I want to do is look at
them.

358
00:21:03,512 --> 00:21:06,431
You know when you see
a dead cat in the road

359
00:21:06,432 --> 00:21:07,951
and you don't want to look at it

360
00:21:07,952 --> 00:21:11,271
but then the more that you try and stop
yourself, the more that you can't help it?

361
00:21:11,272 --> 00:21:15,272
OK. Well, um, how about
I give you one free look, then?

362
00:21:15,672 --> 00:21:18,471
Seeing as you took my power.

363
00:21:18,472 --> 00:21:22,472
That would... That would be
great.

364
00:21:23,272 --> 00:21:24,991
Happy now? Awesome.

365
00:21:24,992 --> 00:21:28,311
So shall I compliment you on them?
Let's just leave the tits, shall we?

366
00:21:28,312 --> 00:21:32,312
Same again?
Mm. Mm...

367
00:21:49,512 --> 00:21:51,031
Jess? Jess?

368
00:21:51,032 --> 00:21:54,111
Shit! Jess, are you all right?
I'm here, I'm here, I'm here, I'm here.

369
00:21:54,112 --> 00:21:57,351
Fuckin' hell!
What's happening? I can't see.

370
00:21:57,352 --> 00:21:58,951
It's the fucking pills
reversed your power.

371
00:21:58,952 --> 00:22:00,911
Oh, Christ!

372
00:22:00,912 --> 00:22:03,111
Am I fucking blind?

373
00:22:03,112 --> 00:22:04,831
No, no, no, you're not.
You're not blind.

374
00:22:04,832 --> 00:22:06,271
You've just got to wait for it
to wear off.

375
00:22:06,272 --> 00:22:07,911
Just sit tight, wait for it to wear
off.

376
00:22:07,912 --> 00:22:10,537
Please don't leave me.
I'm not gonna leave you.

377
00:22:15,295 --> 00:22:18,494
Next time I see someone
collecting for blind people,

378
00:22:18,495 --> 00:22:22,495
I'm giving them a fiver, because
being blind is fucking boring.

379
00:22:23,695 --> 00:22:27,695
Oh, God. Shh! Shh!

380
00:22:28,455 --> 00:22:29,774
You!

381
00:22:29,775 --> 00:22:33,214
I've got something for you.

382
00:22:33,215 --> 00:22:34,934
I knitted you a jumper.

383
00:22:34,935 --> 00:22:38,854
Brilliant! Absolutely. That's
fantastic, cos that's the one thing

384
00:22:38,855 --> 00:22:42,134
this party's missing, is a
bespoke piece of chunky knitwear!

385
00:22:42,135 --> 00:22:43,174
What a relief.

386
00:22:43,175 --> 00:22:47,175
You two have a nice night.

387
00:22:47,295 --> 00:22:48,654
Wh...? What is it?

388
00:22:48,655 --> 00:22:50,054
Honestly, that fucking woman.

389
00:22:50,055 --> 00:22:53,374
Give it here.
It's a bloody future jumper.

390
00:22:53,375 --> 00:22:57,375
What's on it?

391
00:23:01,935 --> 00:23:04,694
Goodness. Honest to God!
What?

392
00:23:04,695 --> 00:23:07,334
You just... You will never
believe this. Fuckin'...

393
00:23:07,335 --> 00:23:08,934
What? We are...

394
00:23:08,935 --> 00:23:10,734
We are get... We are having a f...

395
00:23:10,735 --> 00:23:14,534
We're having... We're getting an
hamster. We're getting a hamster.

396
00:23:14,535 --> 00:23:15,574
A hamster?

397
00:23:15,575 --> 00:23:18,094
Yeah, we're getting a fuckin' ham...
He's an absolute belter.

398
00:23:18,095 --> 00:23:20,734
I can see him right now. How cute!
Wonderful. I hate hamsters.

399
00:23:20,735 --> 00:23:21,854
Well, it's on the jumper.

400
00:23:21,855 --> 00:23:24,774
It's on the fuckin' jumper, so it's
definitely gonna happen now, innit,

401
00:23:24,775 --> 00:23:26,494
for fuck's sake?
What's wrong with you?

402
00:23:26,495 --> 00:23:28,734
Nothing. Jess, honestly,
I am abso...

403
00:23:28,735 --> 00:23:30,614
I'm made up. I'm bloody made up.

404
00:23:30,615 --> 00:23:32,654
I'm just going to get a drink.
Do you want a drink?

405
00:23:32,655 --> 00:23:34,854
Just wait. I'll be back in...
Don't you leave me.

406
00:23:34,855 --> 00:23:38,855
Rudy?

407
00:23:46,175 --> 00:23:47,654
What are you doing?

408
00:23:47,655 --> 00:23:51,655
I'm waiting for Mark
to come up on his pill.

409
00:23:52,255 --> 00:23:53,694
You gave ecstasy to a turtle?

410
00:23:53,695 --> 00:23:57,054
I gave ecstasy to a tortoise.

411
00:23:57,055 --> 00:24:00,174
Yeah.

412
00:24:00,175 --> 00:24:04,175
You know, this really is
the worst party ever.

413
00:24:06,735 --> 00:24:09,454
Why don't you wanna dance? It's
not... It's not really my thing.

414
00:24:09,455 --> 00:24:11,374
Really? I'm not much
of a mover or a shaker.

415
00:24:11,375 --> 00:24:12,494
Hey!

416
00:24:12,495 --> 00:24:16,414
I was looking for you.
I just wanted to let you know...

417
00:24:16,415 --> 00:24:19,254
things are much better now.

418
00:24:19,255 --> 00:24:21,654
Mate, that is so great.

419
00:24:21,655 --> 00:24:24,374
Seriously, man.

420
00:24:24,375 --> 00:24:26,814
I'll see you later.

421
00:24:26,815 --> 00:24:29,734
D'you know what?

422
00:24:29,735 --> 00:24:32,254
Everything used to be so simple.

423
00:24:32,255 --> 00:24:35,494
Like, you'd just meet someone
and you'd like them

424
00:24:35,495 --> 00:24:37,614
and then you'd go on a date
with each other.

425
00:24:37,615 --> 00:24:41,615
And then the storm happens
and everything gets fucked.

426
00:24:41,815 --> 00:24:45,815
Not that... this is a date.

427
00:24:46,135 --> 00:24:47,214
Come on.

428
00:24:47,215 --> 00:24:49,534
Where...? Where are we going?

429
00:24:49,535 --> 00:24:52,215
We're having a dance.

430
00:25:04,415 --> 00:25:08,415
How's your night?

431
00:25:09,975 --> 00:25:12,654
Yeah, pretty...

432
00:25:12,655 --> 00:25:13,814
Pretty shit.

433
00:25:13,815 --> 00:25:16,694
Just found out me best mate's
been having sex with...

434
00:25:16,695 --> 00:25:20,695
probably the only girl
I've ever really loved.

435
00:25:22,655 --> 00:25:25,014
Women don't know what they do to us.

436
00:25:25,015 --> 00:25:29,015
And then they ride off into the
sunset with someone...

437
00:25:29,095 --> 00:25:31,814
..slightly less handsome
than ourselves.

438
00:25:31,815 --> 00:25:34,214
I mean, Alex, yeah,
he's a handsome barman.

439
00:25:34,215 --> 00:25:38,215
But Rudy?
I had a girlfriend once.

440
00:25:39,935 --> 00:25:43,094
Roxy.

441
00:25:43,095 --> 00:25:46,174
My best mate Conti...

442
00:25:46,175 --> 00:25:50,175
..stole her from me.

443
00:25:51,735 --> 00:25:54,494
See - flying...

444
00:25:54,495 --> 00:25:58,134
electricity and that is camouflage.

445
00:25:58,135 --> 00:26:00,374
You are superheroes, guys. You are!

446
00:26:00,375 --> 00:26:03,534
Great. The Jumper Posse.

447
00:26:03,535 --> 00:26:06,094
That is such a shit name
for a gang of superheroes.

448
00:26:06,095 --> 00:26:07,734
At least we agree on something.

449
00:26:07,735 --> 00:26:09,094
Who's the guy on the roof?

450
00:26:09,095 --> 00:26:11,254
Oh, I think that's me. Huh...

451
00:26:11,255 --> 00:26:15,134
What is your power? Because
we all bring something to the table.

452
00:26:15,135 --> 00:26:17,934
So far, you've just got
a shit taste in jumpers.

453
00:26:17,935 --> 00:26:20,734
Don't take the piss out of him.

454
00:26:20,735 --> 00:26:22,774
I think I'm your mentor.

455
00:26:22,775 --> 00:26:24,894
Actually, you know, like the, um...

456
00:26:24,895 --> 00:26:28,614
Like the talking rat on the Teenage
Mutant Ninja Turtles, the, er...

457
00:26:28,615 --> 00:26:29,654
Splinter!

458
00:26:29,655 --> 00:26:31,774
What would we do if...

459
00:26:31,775 --> 00:26:35,014
we were a gang of superheroes?
Well, you'd fight crime, like...

460
00:26:35,015 --> 00:26:37,094
muggers, and rapists,
and things like that.

461
00:26:37,095 --> 00:26:39,374
Sounds quite... dangerous.

462
00:26:39,375 --> 00:26:42,694
She's right. Forget the rapists.

463
00:26:42,695 --> 00:26:46,695
We could focus on people
who drop chewing gum.

464
00:26:46,935 --> 00:26:48,814
D'you know what? This is bullshit!

465
00:26:48,815 --> 00:26:52,134
Don't need to be in any fucking
gang. I can take care of myself.

466
00:26:52,135 --> 00:26:56,135
Helen? Don't... Oh...

467
00:27:04,375 --> 00:27:05,414
Jess?

468
00:27:05,415 --> 00:27:09,414
Can you help me?
I've taken a pill and now I'm blind.

469
00:27:09,415 --> 00:27:10,694
And I need a piss.

470
00:27:10,695 --> 00:27:12,774
Where's your boyfriend?

471
00:27:12,775 --> 00:27:15,694
I don't know.
He's just fucked off and left me.

472
00:27:15,695 --> 00:27:16,934
Trouble in Paradise?

473
00:27:16,935 --> 00:27:20,854
I didn't mean for you
to find out like that. I am sorry.

474
00:27:20,855 --> 00:27:24,254
Just help me.

475
00:27:24,255 --> 00:27:28,255
This one of those future jumpers?

476
00:27:31,415 --> 00:27:32,494
You're having a baby?

477
00:27:32,495 --> 00:27:34,614
What baby? Great!

478
00:27:34,615 --> 00:27:36,814
So, first you're going out with him,
now you're starting a family?!

479
00:27:36,815 --> 00:27:40,815
Seriously, whose fucking idea
was this party any...?

480
00:27:42,055 --> 00:27:44,734
Where are you going?
To find Rudy.

481
00:27:44,735 --> 00:27:48,735
I'm going to fucking kill him!

482
00:28:00,975 --> 00:28:04,174
Mate, we have got a fucking major
problem -

483
00:28:04,175 --> 00:28:06,854
it's this jumper thing.
Jess, she's having a baby.

484
00:28:06,855 --> 00:28:08,254
We're gonna be a dad.
No, not right now.

485
00:28:08,255 --> 00:28:10,174
I'm looking for Helen.

486
00:28:10,175 --> 00:28:12,054
Fuck Helen, man. I need you, bruv.

487
00:28:12,055 --> 00:28:16,055
You just can't stand it, can you,
because I'm happy?

488
00:28:26,215 --> 00:28:27,615
Agh!

489
00:28:49,095 --> 00:28:52,094
It's just a jumper. Forget about it.

490
00:28:52,095 --> 00:28:56,095
It wasn't just a jumper,
to me, though, it was mine.

491
00:28:56,295 --> 00:29:00,295
My thing, and my friends
and my gang, just for once.

492
00:29:01,055 --> 00:29:03,894
Honestly, for once I just wanted
to be a part of something

493
00:29:03,895 --> 00:29:07,334
that wasn't all about 'im.

494
00:29:07,335 --> 00:29:11,335
I'm not with you because it says so
on some fucking jumper.

495
00:29:13,055 --> 00:29:17,055
I'm with you because I like you.

496
00:29:20,855 --> 00:29:21,934
So...

497
00:29:21,935 --> 00:29:23,854
you ready for your birthday present?

498
00:29:23,855 --> 00:29:27,855
Yeah.

499
00:29:31,175 --> 00:29:35,175
I am going to fuck you
until you beg me to stop.

500
00:30:39,175 --> 00:30:40,774
I never could trust you, Roxy.

501
00:30:40,775 --> 00:30:43,174
What the fuck are you doing?
Get out!

502
00:30:43,175 --> 00:30:44,214
Tim?

503
00:30:44,215 --> 00:30:45,814
You think you can just ride away
into the sunset.

504
00:30:45,815 --> 00:30:46,974
Tim?

505
00:30:46,975 --> 00:30:49,014
You broke my heart, Roxy.

506
00:30:49,015 --> 00:30:50,814
Tim, it's me. It's Rudy 2.

507
00:30:50,815 --> 00:30:53,334
I know who you are.

508
00:30:53,335 --> 00:30:54,734
You're Conti.

509
00:30:54,735 --> 00:30:57,294
You stole my woman.
No, I... No, I didn't.

510
00:30:57,295 --> 00:30:58,694
Tim, this isn't real.

511
00:30:58,695 --> 00:31:01,614
It's the game world.
You just snap your band.

512
00:31:01,615 --> 00:31:05,134
Tim, where's your band, mate? You
can't not have your band with you.

513
00:31:05,135 --> 00:31:06,614
You could... No, no, no, no, Tim!

514
00:31:06,615 --> 00:31:09,574
Give me one good reason
why I shouldn't shoot you both down.

515
00:31:09,575 --> 00:31:12,695
Please, don't...

516
00:31:31,655 --> 00:31:35,655
Urgh!

517
00:31:42,975 --> 00:31:45,494
Is he dead?

518
00:31:45,495 --> 00:31:49,495
He's dead.

519
00:31:50,535 --> 00:31:54,535
I've thought about you lots.
I can't believe you're really here.

520
00:31:55,015 --> 00:31:56,774
It feels strange.

521
00:31:56,775 --> 00:31:58,614
It... It feels...

522
00:31:58,615 --> 00:32:02,615
great.

523
00:32:03,655 --> 00:32:07,655
What about when the pill wears off?

524
00:32:07,815 --> 00:32:11,694
We'll sort something out.

525
00:32:11,695 --> 00:32:14,934
I get... I get so lonely
when you're out on the estate.

526
00:32:14,935 --> 00:32:18,935
I'm just in my shell waiting for you.

527
00:32:20,455 --> 00:32:24,455
We'll buy a big bag of pills.
I'll get Alex to shag you.

528
00:32:25,415 --> 00:32:29,415
I won't let you go back in there.

529
00:33:17,575 --> 00:33:21,575
Is there somewhere we can go?

530
00:34:15,015 --> 00:34:18,254
What the fuck was that?

531
00:34:18,255 --> 00:34:21,574
I thought I'd already taken your
power. Have you got two powers?

532
00:34:21,575 --> 00:34:23,854
I feel a bit... I feel a bit weird.

533
00:34:23,855 --> 00:34:26,454
Can you get me a glass of water?
Yeah.

534
00:34:26,455 --> 00:34:27,854
Yeah, sure, yeah.

535
00:34:27,855 --> 00:34:31,855
Just wait here a minute.

536
00:34:37,255 --> 00:34:40,814
They've run out of spring rolls,
in case you're wondering.

537
00:34:40,815 --> 00:34:43,374
I wasn't wondering, actually.

538
00:34:43,375 --> 00:34:46,134
Fucking hell,
don't take your pill neither, dude.

539
00:34:46,135 --> 00:34:48,094
Dude, it reverses your power.

540
00:34:48,095 --> 00:34:49,654
Don't take it.

541
00:34:49,655 --> 00:34:53,053
What do you mean, it reverses them?
It reverses them like what?

542
00:35:04,510 --> 00:35:06,869
And I shagged all of my
powers into her.

543
00:35:07,901 --> 00:35:10,540
What do you mean, all your
powers?

544
00:35:10,541 --> 00:35:13,741
I mean all of them. I mean the power
to cause accidents,

545
00:35:13,794 --> 00:35:17,694
turning things inside out, the
hypnotic tits, the devil thing.

546
00:35:17,769 --> 00:35:21,368
Guys! Guys, have you seen
Jess? I can't find her.

547
00:35:21,369 --> 00:35:22,928
Well, maybe you shouldn't
have left her.

548
00:35:22,929 --> 00:35:25,888
Mate, not now, Finlay, for fuck's
sake, man.

549
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:27,119
We're gonna have to split up.

550
00:35:27,176 --> 00:35:31,176
Come on.

551
00:35:31,487 --> 00:35:35,487
Rudy?

552
00:35:56,207 --> 00:35:58,326
Ecce satanas meo,

553
00:35:58,327 --> 00:36:02,327
sicut ego et ipse regnabit
Dominus...

554
00:36:16,118 --> 00:36:17,597
Hello, Alex!

555
00:36:17,690 --> 00:36:21,369
Ah, whatever you do,
do not look at her tits.

556
00:36:21,370 --> 00:36:23,889
Guys.

557
00:36:23,890 --> 00:36:26,169
You're kidding me, aren't
you?! For fuck's sake, guys!

558
00:36:26,170 --> 00:36:27,529
Look at you.

559
00:36:27,530 --> 00:36:29,089
Men.

560
00:36:29,090 --> 00:36:31,649
You're all so pathetic.

561
00:36:31,650 --> 00:36:34,129
And now...

562
00:36:34,130 --> 00:36:37,809
...you're mine.
Yeah...

563
00:36:37,810 --> 00:36:41,810
I'm gonna make every guy on
the estate kneel before me.

564
00:36:43,370 --> 00:36:47,370
Ecce satanas meo, sicut ego
et ipse...

565
00:36:54,730 --> 00:36:58,730
Help me.
Please? Please, help me.

566
00:37:05,130 --> 00:37:06,689
Jess!

567
00:37:06,690 --> 00:37:10,690
Alex?
Jess, it's me.

568
00:37:14,730 --> 00:37:18,730
Go. Go and get him!

569
00:37:43,770 --> 00:37:47,689
So, this is what you're doing while
I'm in your locker eating lettuce.

570
00:37:47,690 --> 00:37:51,690
More or less.

571
00:37:53,410 --> 00:37:55,849
No, let's check the, er...

572
00:37:55,850 --> 00:37:59,649
Don't listen to her Latin,
don't look at her tits.

573
00:37:59,650 --> 00:38:02,769
Your devil tits don't work on
me. I'm a girl.

574
00:38:02,770 --> 00:38:06,770
Guess I'm just gonna have to turn
your boyfriend inside out, then.

575
00:38:24,450 --> 00:38:26,569
Now I've got your full
attention...

576
00:38:26,570 --> 00:38:30,570
Ecce satanas meo, sicut ego
et ipse regnabit Dominus...

577
00:39:01,250 --> 00:39:05,250
So this has been a pretty
weird date.

578
00:39:08,210 --> 00:39:10,370
Not that it's a date.

579
00:39:13,690 --> 00:39:16,529
Leave him. He's mine.

580
00:39:16,530 --> 00:39:20,530
What's the matter, Alex?
Don't you trust yourself?

581
00:39:22,530 --> 00:39:24,409
What's going to happen if
you...

582
00:39:24,410 --> 00:39:27,529
have a little look?

583
00:39:27,530 --> 00:39:30,729
It's just a pair of tits.

584
00:39:30,730 --> 00:39:34,730
And you're one of the good
guys, remember?

585
00:39:34,890 --> 00:39:38,729
You're not some weak,
pathetic animal

586
00:39:38,730 --> 00:39:42,689
who's ruled by his urges.

587
00:39:42,690 --> 00:39:46,449
There was a girl I used to
know.

588
00:39:46,450 --> 00:39:49,449
Emma.

589
00:39:49,450 --> 00:39:53,129
She was like you.

590
00:39:53,130 --> 00:39:57,130
She was a good person
who just got the wrong power.

591
00:40:02,050 --> 00:40:05,369
She was accident prone.

592
00:40:05,370 --> 00:40:09,370
Wasn't her fault. It was just bad
things used to happen to her.

593
00:40:14,810 --> 00:40:18,810
I'm so sorry, Sarah.

594
00:40:21,410 --> 00:40:25,410
You didn't deserve any of this.

595
00:40:26,610 --> 00:40:29,249
Oh... I get it.

596
00:40:29,250 --> 00:40:33,250
I'm supposed to slip on the
banana skin.

597
00:40:34,970 --> 00:40:38,970
Any other bright ideas?

598
00:40:40,810 --> 00:40:42,010
Agh!

599
00:41:23,410 --> 00:41:27,410
Where the fuck have you been?!

600
00:41:31,410 --> 00:41:34,089
So is that what's gonna
happen if we do have a baby?

601
00:41:34,090 --> 00:41:38,090
You're just going to disappear and
leave me to fend for myself?

602
00:41:39,130 --> 00:41:40,529
Fuckin' hell. I don't know.

603
00:41:40,530 --> 00:41:43,489
You don't know? No!

604
00:41:43,490 --> 00:41:45,729
That's great! That is very
reassuring!

605
00:41:45,730 --> 00:41:48,529
Honestly. If you want someone who's
going to be a good dad

606
00:41:48,530 --> 00:41:50,969
and look after this fucking baby
then you've got the wrong Rudy

607
00:41:50,970 --> 00:41:54,289
cos I'm the shit one. Or don't you
remember that? What are you saying?

608
00:41:54,290 --> 00:41:58,089
I'm saying it's too fucking much,
man. I just can't handle it.

609
00:41:58,090 --> 00:42:01,729
I'm sorry.

610
00:42:01,730 --> 00:42:03,169
Fuck you!

611
00:42:03,170 --> 00:42:07,170
Fucking coward!

612
00:42:31,210 --> 00:42:33,769
What the fuck have we done?

613
00:42:33,770 --> 00:42:37,770
Look... Look, Tim was out of
control...

614
00:42:37,970 --> 00:42:40,969
...and we have done the right
thing.

615
00:42:40,970 --> 00:42:44,849
It's the jumper and it has started
and still none of you believe me.

616
00:42:44,850 --> 00:42:48,850
Well, this is... This is our
destiny.

617
00:42:51,210 --> 00:42:53,169
Come on.

618
00:42:53,170 --> 00:42:57,170
Why not?

619
00:43:18,690 --> 00:43:21,169
We're getting a better name.

620
00:43:21,170 --> 00:43:25,170
We're gonna be unstoppable.

621
00:43:28,730 --> 00:43:31,089
It's your superhero lair.

622
00:43:31,090 --> 00:43:32,969
They are your costumes.

623
00:43:32,970 --> 00:43:35,209
Your secret identity.

624
00:43:35,210 --> 00:43:38,449
Let's do some good.

625
00:43:38,450 --> 00:43:41,649
Are you going to pick that up?

626
00:43:41,650 --> 00:43:42,769
Agh!

627
00:43:42,770 --> 00:43:46,770
Today is the last day
of your community service.

628
00:43:47,450 --> 00:43:50,169
This is as good as it gets for
you.

629
00:43:50,170 --> 00:43:53,330
Oh, my God!
That is... That's a man flying.

630
00:43:56,290 --> 00:43:59,329
I loved you.

631
00:43:59,330 --> 00:44:00,409
I'm sorry.

632
00:44:00,410 --> 00:44:03,489
I've made a terrible error of
judgment.

633
00:44:03,490 --> 00:44:04,729
They tried to kill me.

634
00:44:04,730 --> 00:44:08,169
Well, they chose the wrong
day to do that, Finlay.

635
00:44:08,170 --> 00:44:09,289
They're coming.

636
00:44:09,290 --> 00:44:11,106
I suppose you'd better kill
them.

637
00:44:11,131 --> 00:44:53,480
