00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:03,659
You're that runner guy.

2
00:00:03,660 --> 00:00:05,099
You screwed up big-time.

3
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:06,499
You noticed, yeah?

4
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:08,339
What did you do?

5
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:09,379
Me?

6
00:00:09,380 --> 00:00:12,019
I was done for
eating some pick 'n' mix.

7
00:00:12,020 --> 00:00:15,699
Me and this girl I was seeing, Sam.

8
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:18,579
Police caught us.
I had one wrap on me.

9
00:00:18,580 --> 00:00:20,539
She had the rest of it.

10
00:00:20,540 --> 00:00:22,739
No-one gets community service
for possession.

11
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:26,539
They said cos of my profile,
they needed to send a message.

12
00:00:26,540 --> 00:00:30,099
WOMAN: They were the last people
to see him. They know something.

13
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:31,459
It's them.

14
00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:33,579
Ahhh!

15
00:00:33,580 --> 00:00:35,379
MAN: Maybe he left you.

16
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:38,579
WOMAN: He'd never do that to me.
He wouldn't.

17
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:41,219
CURTIS: All this,
it's already happened once.

18
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:43,619
SAM: What are you saying?
What? You turned back time?

19
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:46,379
Everything happened again!
Exactly the same!

20
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:49,179
They're going to think
the probation worker's still alive.

21
00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:53,179
I stole his credit card.
I used it to book a flight.

22
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:57,419
I know you want to.
All I have to do...is touch you.

23
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:00,419
Ahhh!

24
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:03,619
Keith was talking to your mate
and he's a dog, yeah?

25
00:01:03,620 --> 00:01:04,779
It's doing my head in.

26
00:01:04,780 --> 00:01:05,819
'Get her tits out.'

27
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:09,819
You don't need to
use your power on me.

28
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:14,539
I'm already there.

42
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:16,659
Oh, my God! That is such a shamer.
Do you think he's told the others?

43
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:20,619
Bashing himself out of it.

44
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:24,619
Yeah. I'm pretty sure he told 'em.

45
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:26,939
And she was totally
clicking the mouse off herself, man.

46
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:27,979
And she was totally
clicking the mouse off herself, man.
No way!

47
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:30,739
They were just, like,
really face-to-face.

48
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:32,539
He was wanking,

49
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:36,059
she was flicking her own bean,
right in each other's face.

50
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:40,059
You should've filmed it.

51
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:44,099
Work that bean! Work that bean,
Kelly, my love! Oh! Er, hi.

52
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:45,299
Shut up.

53
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:46,859
You enjoyed it, you pervert.

54
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:47,899
(LAUGHS)

55
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:50,459
What? Do you want to have a look too?

56
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:52,579
No, thanks. I'm OK.

57
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:56,579
Can I have another look?

58
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:58,859
Prick.

59
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:01,259
Does anyone actually know
what he got done for?

60
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:02,699
Says it was for eating pick 'n' mix.

61
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:05,899
Says it was for eating pick 'n' mix.
That's bullshit.

62
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:07,419
Are you two, like, together?

63
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:09,019
Yeah, I guess.

64
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:10,579
It's weird, yeah?

65
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:14,139
Cos of my bullshit power thing,
we don't actually have proper sex.

66
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:18,139
We just stare at each other
and wank ourselves off.

67
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:22,219
But it is really special.

68
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:30,419
It's not gay
cos we're not touching.

69
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:32,979
All you want to do is get down
to it and you can't, cos...

70
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:34,899
Hi.

71
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:36,499
That's really disgusting.

72
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:38,379
That's really disgusting.
It's not fucking disgusting.

73
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:39,859
When did you get out?

74
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:43,539
A few days ago.

75
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:47,539
It's good to see you.

76
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:52,859
You're saying Tony's walking round
using his credit card.

77
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:57,459
(LAUGHS) So why has no-one seen him?

78
00:05:58,180 --> 00:06:01,579
Because it's not him!

79
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:02,739
Someone's stolen it.

80
00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:06,739
Look, if you're not going to
do anything, then I will.

81
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:31,219
How was it in there?

82
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:35,219
Well, wasn't a lot of laughs.

83
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:39,099
How you doing?
How's community service?

84
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:43,099
Is what it is, innit?
Just need to get through it.

85
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:47,979
It's all so messed up.

86
00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:51,299
Screwed our lives
over a bit of coke.

87
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:54,579
You're out now. You need to move on.
Do something different.

88
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:58,579
Think anyone's gonna give me a job
with a conviction for dealing?

89
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:03,099
I saw you with that girl.

90
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:07,099
Are you with her?

91
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:12,739
She's beautiful.

92
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:14,659
It just happened, like.

93
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:18,539
I didn't mean it to.

94
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:20,299
There's stuff
going on with me right now,

95
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:21,659
things I can't tell you about.

96
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:23,979
Sam! I'm sorry.

97
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:27,139
Sam?

98
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:31,139
I'm sorry.

99
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:36,699
Why didn't you visit me?

100
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:38,219
Cos I felt too guilty, innit?

101
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:39,899
I asked you to buy the gear.

102
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:42,019
It should've been me
that went prison.

103
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:42,779
Things didn't work out
like that, did they?

104
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:44,179
Things didn't work out
like that, did they?
I told 'em.

105
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:47,179
I told the police it was for me
and my mates. They wouldn't listen.

106
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:51,179
Trust me, if I could do anything
to change it, I would.

107
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:56,059
You should've visited me!

108
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:58,059
I know.

109
00:07:58,060 --> 00:08:01,499
I couldn't see you in there.

110
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:02,779
I couldn't look you in the eye.

111
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:04,299
So you hook up with someone else?

112
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:07,139
She's helping you
deal with it, is she?

113
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:09,379
My life is fucked!

114
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:11,259
And that's on you.

115
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:15,259

00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:07,999
Don't worry. Stay calm.
Let's have a look. Don't move.

357
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:16,639
I saw you run last year.

358
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:18,839
You were in a different league.

359
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:20,959
Turn around.

360
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:23,959
You don't need to be getting
involved in this kind of thing.

361
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:26,399
Not with your profile.

362
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:27,919
Think, yeah?

363
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:31,759
Sort yourself out.

364
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:32,799
Clean?

365
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:36,679
Clean?

366
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:40,119
Well, I expect I'll be seeing you.

367
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:44,119
Come on.

368
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:54,159
(CACKLES)

369
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:56,399
Oh, shit, man!

370
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:57,919
Oh, God, I feel sick.

371
00:26:57,920 --> 00:27:00,879
(LAUGHS)

372
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:01,919
Oh...

373
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:05,679
So, you'll be wanting
your gear back, yeah?

374
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:07,159
DOOR OPENS

375
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:10,959
Your dad's here.

376
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:13,479
What are you doing here?

377
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:15,679
Your mum called me from Spain.

378
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:18,119
So, what did you do?

379
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:19,639
Nothin'.

380
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:21,279
I'm dragged out
in the middle of the night

381
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:24,119
and have to come all the way
down here because you did nothing?

382
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:26,119
It looks that way.
It's a bitch, isn't it?

383
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:28,879
Mmm. So, what's it going to cost me
to sort this out?

384
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:30,199
I don't want your money.

385
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:31,239
Oh, really?

386
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:34,399
Cos I don't see anybody else
rushing down here to bail you out.

387
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:38,319
I didn't ask you to come
and bail me out, so...

388
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:39,879
Don't be a wanker.

389
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:41,319
(CHUCKLES)

390
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:44,519
Thanks for the fatherly advice.
It makes me feel all warm inside.

391
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:46,719
What do we owe you?

392
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:49,159
Beverley, I don't want him
paying for it.

393
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:50,639
You want him to call the police?

394
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:53,719
Yeah. I do, actually.
Bev, call the police.

395
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:56,039
Yeah, you heard the man.
Go on, call the police.

396
00:27:56,040 --> 00:28:00,039
Call 'em!

397
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:02,959
Are you still here?

398
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:04,319
(CHUCKLES)

399
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:07,279
Yeah. Police, please.

400
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:10,479
See ya, Dad.
Let's do this again sometime.

401
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:14,479
It's been really special.

402
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:17,319
You and your dad seem close.

403
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:18,359
(CHUCKLES)

404
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:20,119
Oh, shut up, Beverley!

405
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:21,319
Arrrgghhh!

406
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:23,239
(SCREAMING)

407
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:25,039
How'd you know
the police were there?

408
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:27,799
I saw them in the club,
so I stashed them here.

409
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:31,799
There was no time to warn you.

410
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:36,399
I owe you one, man.

411
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:38,039
Have 'em. They're on me.

412
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:39,079
Have 'em. They're on me.
No.

413
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:43,079
No, I'm good.

414
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:49,799
See you around.

415
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:02,839
We need to get so drunk.

416
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:15,119
I am kicking your arse.

417
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:18,039
Come on. Let's see what you've got.

418
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:22,039
Come on. Let's see what you've got.
Come on, then.

419
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:32,559
That's the guy that
gave me his hoodie.

420
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:34,119
Oh, he's really nice.

421
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:34,559
Yeah?

422
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:37,879
Yeah?
Really nice.

423
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:39,599
Stand there.

424
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:41,239
I'll get the door.

425
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:45,239
(BURPS)

426
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:55,799
I feel like shit.

427
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:14,159
Kel?

428
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:18,159
Do you wanna marry me?

429
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:23,879
What?

430
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:27,879
That is so fuckin' romantic.

00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:44,759
You're that runner guy.

434
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:48,759
What are you smiling about?

435
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:50,799
What, is it a secret?

436
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:53,639
(CHUCKLES)

437
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:57,239
I just changed history. I...

438
00:30:57,240 --> 00:30:58,999
I changed the future.

439
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,599
Just so you know, yeah,

440
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:04,599
saying weird things like that
is a real turn-off.

441
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:08,159
She'll have a vodka tonic
with a little bit of lime.

442
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:11,079
How'd you know what I drink?

443
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:12,639
Have we...?

444
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:13,679
Have we...?
No.

445
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:17,679
But we will.

446
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:35,679
Where's the car?

447
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:38,639
Are we on the right level?

448
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:42,639
Yeah. It was right here.

449
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:48,879
Someone's nicked it, haven't they?

450
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:52,879
Jesus.

451
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:54,719
Wankers!

452
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:56,199

453
00:31:56,200 --> 00:32:00,199
Oh!

454
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:02,799
Tony! Stop it. Stop it.

455
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:04,639
It's a car. It's insured.

456
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:08,639
Your engagement ring was in there!

457
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:16,319
Were you going to propose to me?

458
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:20,319
Yeah.

459
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:24,879
Can I still say yes?

460
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:29,759

Mmm.

463
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:39,479
If they'd have caught us with
the drugs, we would've been screwed.

464
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:41,519
If they'd have caught us with
the drugs, we would've been screwed.
Shh. It didn't happen.

465
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:44,479
Everything's going to be all right.

466
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:46,479
We got away with it.

467
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:50,479
We did it.

468
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:59,359
I'll get us a couple more drinks.

What are you saying?

474
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:55,879
What?

475
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:59,879
Yeah. Yeah, I'll be at the track
in about...

476
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,799
What?

477
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:15,799
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Listen, I'll be a little bit late.

478
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:20,199
There's someone I need to see.

479
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:34,279
It's you.

480
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:36,919
What?

481
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:39,519
Do I know you?

482
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:43,519
I... I thought
you were someone else.

483
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:52,159
What happened?

484
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:56,199
We were doing our community
service...

485
00:35:57,880 --> 00:36:01,879
..and the probation worker
flipped out. Just...

486
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,559
Just went crazy and then...

487
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:09,559
Then he killed them.

488
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:17,079
How come you survived?

489
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:21,159
They said I was half dead
when they found me.

490
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:28,439
I guess I'm just lucky.

491
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:32,479
I didn't stop him.

492
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:32,999
Argh!

493
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,199
Argh!
What's that?

494
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:37,159
Did you know them?

495
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:40,159
I wasn't there.

496
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:43,079
I wasn't there.

497
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:47,079
I should've been caught.
I could've stopped this.

498
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:51,359
I wasn't there.

499
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:55,359
I wasn't there.

It's only one wrap.

00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:38,559
You either tell me who sold it to
you or you get done for possession.

00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:44,079
You've got nowhere to go.

539
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:48,079
Open up!

540
00:38:48,680 --> 00:38:50,359
Don't waste my time!

541
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:51,759
Argh!

542
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:55,759
Arms up.

543
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:02,239
Looks like you forgot to flush one.

544
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:06,239
I'm arresting you for possession.

545
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:11,479
I saw you running last year.
They'll ban you for this.

546
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:14,479
What's going to happen to her?

547
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:18,479
She didn't have anything on her.
She's free to go. Come on.

548
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:23,999
Curtis.

549
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:32,359
(GASPS)

550
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:36,359
ALARM BEEPS

551
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:17,319
Hi.

552
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:21,319
# THE SPECIALS:
A Message To You, Rudy

553
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:35,999
Hi.

554
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:39,999
# Stop your messin' around

555
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:43,519
# Better think of your future... #

556
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:44,519
It's good to see you.

557
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:48,519
It's good to see you.
You saw me yesterday.

558
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:00,039
What you doing?

559
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:04,039
Trust me. We need to lock the door.

560
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:08,239
MOANING AND PANTING

561
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:11,279
(WHISTLES IDLY)

562
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:13,919
LOUD MOANING

563
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:17,919
BANGING ON DOOR

564
00:41:19,240 --> 00:41:23,239
PANTING

565
00:41:24,840 --> 00:41:26,599
Are you two shagging in there?

566
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:30,879
Well, how long you gonna be?

567
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:32,319
Will you piss off?

568
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:33,959
CLASHING

569
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:37,959
OK. Just give us a shout
when you're done.

570
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:44,919
Does anyone actually know
what he got done for?

571
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:46,359
Says it was for eating pick 'n' mix.

572
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:49,559
Says it was for eating pick 'n' mix.
That's bullshit.

573
00:41:49,560 --> 00:41:51,079
Are you two, like, together?

574
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:53,039
Yeah, I guess.

575
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:54,319
It's weird, yeah.

576
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:58,319
Cos of my bullshit power thing,
we don't actually have proper sex.

577
00:41:58,320 --> 00:42:01,959
We just stare at each other
and wank ourselves off.

578
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:05,959
But it is really special.

579
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:15,599
Come on, buddy. It's not gay
if I wank you off with the grabber.

580
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:17,119
We're not touching.

581
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:18,959
All you wanna do is get down to it,
but you can't.

582
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:20,039
That's disgusting.

583
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:21,599
That's disgusting.
It's not fucking disgusting. >

584
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:25,599
Hi!

585
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:29,159
What are you doing here?

586
00:42:29,160 --> 00:42:30,919
I was in the neighbourhood.

587
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:34,159
I miss you
when you're stuck here all day.

588
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:38,159
Are you just going to stand there
or are you going to do something
about it?

589
00:42:45,160 --> 00:42:49,159
Shit!

590
00:43:36,080 --> 00:43:40,079
Tony.

591
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:46,639
Pervert!

592
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:47,439
He's such a twat.

593
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:48,599
He's such a twat.
He is a twat.

594
00:43:48,600 --> 00:43:49,999
We have outfoxed the fox,

595
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,399
which makes us very bloody foxy.

596
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:54,599
It's not easy being you, is it?

597
00:43:54,600 --> 00:43:56,039
Have you seen Curtis?

598
00:43:56,040 --> 00:43:57,559
Who are you?
I'm his girlfriend.

599
00:43:57,560 --> 00:43:59,079
Oh...

600
00:43:59,080 --> 00:44:01,319
I thought that was you.
Do you want a lift?

601
00:44:01,320 --> 00:44:03,239
Alisha, it isn't how it sounds.

602
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:05,079
How long
have you been with her?

603
00:44:05,080 --> 00:44:07,079
Why don't you call round my house
and I'll cook dinner?

604
00:44:07,080 --> 00:44:08,599
Why don't you call round my house
and I'll cook dinner?
Are you asking me around for sex?

605
00:44:08,600 --> 00:44:10,719
Nathan's stealing a baby.
It's all right.

606
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:11,719
Why would he take a baby?

607
00:44:11,720 --> 00:44:13,759
Why would he take a baby?
You're acting like a freak.

608
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:15,639
What have I told you about
filming us on that thing?

609
00:44:15,640 --> 00:44:19,639
Well, look at you, using
your powers, being all superhero.

610
00:44:20,080 --> 00:44:24,079
They're the only friends I've got.

611
00:44:30,680 --> 00:44:34,679
