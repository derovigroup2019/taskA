1
00:00:01,460 --> 00:00:03,160
You killed our probation worker!

2
00:00:03,995 --> 00:00:05,085
He's got Tony's credit card.

3
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:08,320
It doesn't prove he murdered Tony.
The most we can do him for is fraud.

4
00:00:08,355 --> 00:00:09,645
Don't take this the wrong way,

5
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:12,805
but you look like
a panty-sniffer.

6
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:15,480
Well, look at you, using your powers,
being all superhero.

7
00:00:15,515 --> 00:00:19,480
Everyone can do something except me.

8
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:22,320
You don't need to use your power
on me. I'm already there.

9
00:00:22,355 --> 00:00:26,280
I'm not getting a shag
now I'm a homeless.

10
00:00:26,315 --> 00:00:28,405
Do you want me to walk you home?

11
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:30,600
So I guess we're
getting serious, then.

12
00:00:30,635 --> 00:00:32,160
Do you wanna go for a drink with me?

13
00:00:32,195 --> 00:00:34,125
I'm your probation worker.

14
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:38,160
You were just using me.

15
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:05,585
I was a nasty slut.

16
00:01:05,620 --> 00:01:09,620
I went with so many boys and girls,

17
00:01:10,220 --> 00:01:14,220
girls and boys at the same time.

18
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:17,900
I took part in...

19
00:01:17,935 --> 00:01:19,785
disgusting,

20
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:23,780
perverted, unnatural acts.

21
00:01:23,815 --> 00:01:26,157
I was drinking

22
00:01:26,192 --> 00:01:28,465
and taking drugs.

23
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:32,220
I used bad language all the time.

24
00:01:32,255 --> 00:01:36,220
I called my mum...

25
00:01:36,580 --> 00:01:38,360
...a "fat bitch".

26
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:44,140
But I'm not like that any more.

27
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:48,380
I'm a good person.

28
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:56,425
That...

29
00:01:56,460 --> 00:01:59,840
That ain't normal.

30
00:01:59,875 --> 00:02:03,185
She went to my school.

31
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:05,940
This one time, she's doing this boy
I know in her dad's car, yeah?

32
00:02:05,975 --> 00:02:09,940
She gets off him and sits
on the gear stick.

33
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:14,380
She's on there for, like,
20 minutes, literally...

34
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:35,740
Try that in your driving test,
you are definitely getting a fail.

35
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:38,665
Or a pass.

36
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:41,220
And maybe some kind
of internal injury.

37
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:44,740
It's the same with
some girls on my estate.

38
00:02:44,775 --> 00:02:48,100
No-one's even getting
pregnant any more.

39
00:02:48,135 --> 00:02:49,545
What about your friends?

40
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:53,340
I believe that's generally
referred to as a "paedophile ring".

41
00:02:53,375 --> 00:02:54,385
I'm not a paedophile.

42
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:58,140
Yeah? You'd screw your own sister
for a slice of cheese.

43
00:02:58,175 --> 00:03:00,105
I don't even like cheese.

44
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:01,905
That makes it even worse,
you sick bastard.

45
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:05,940
Maybe she's done sitting on
her dad's gear stick. It's a thought.

46
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:07,905
It's not just her, is it?

47
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:09,460
Oh, yeah, look there's
more.

48
00:03:09,495 --> 00:03:10,780
I know him.

49
00:03:10,815 --> 00:03:12,225
Oi, you!

50
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:14,185
Can I help you?

51
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:16,665
Why are you all dressed like
retards?

52
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:19,460
There's a meeting in
the community centre tonight.

53
00:03:19,495 --> 00:03:21,580
You should come along and find out.

54
00:03:21,615 --> 00:03:22,585
All of you.

55
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:25,105
Right. Cool. See you there, buddy.

56
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:28,060
He used to be a right
headcase.

57
00:03:28,095 --> 00:03:30,980
Bring your friends.
This is weird.

58
00:03:31,015 --> 00:03:33,217
They need our help.

59
00:03:33,252 --> 00:03:36,336
Things have to change.

60
00:03:57,300 --> 00:04:00,300

61
00:04:17,212 --> 00:04:19,985
She's never late.

62
00:04:20,020 --> 00:04:21,880
I think she's gone on holiday.

63
00:04:21,915 --> 00:04:23,705
Did she tell you that?

64
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:25,960
She said she was going to Greece.
No...

65
00:04:25,995 --> 00:04:28,145
They would've sent
someone to cover her.

66
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:29,825
We should phone
probation headquarters

67
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:33,860
and get them to send someone
down here now to supervise us.

68
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:04,660
Well, this is intense.

69
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:10,980
Don't, Nathan.

70
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:38,820
Can you get me a can of Coke?

71
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:44,180
Fuck me.

72
00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:47,665
What?

73
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:49,505
Don't you have any shame?

74
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:53,540
Don't you have any dress sense?
Seriously, you look like my mum.

75
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:55,300
And you look like a slut.

76
00:05:55,335 --> 00:05:56,505
Are you for real?

77
00:05:56,540 --> 00:05:59,860
You think having sex with boys
will make them respect you?

78
00:05:59,895 --> 00:06:03,180
If you behave like a slut,
they'll treat you like a slut.

79
00:06:03,215 --> 00:06:07,180
Freak.

80
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:13,940
You don't need
to behave like this.

81
00:06:13,975 --> 00:06:17,940
You can be so much better.

82
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:33,040
You just need to ignore Nathan.
He's a dick.

83
00:06:33,075 --> 00:06:35,447
He doesn't care what
anyone says to him.

84
00:06:35,482 --> 00:06:37,820
He thinks it's the same for
everyone.

85
00:06:37,855 --> 00:06:41,065
It's not, though, is it?

86
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:43,465
Me and you. We're not like that.

87
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:47,500
I'll talk to him.
I'll tell him to back off, yeah?

88
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:49,580
'I did it for you,

89
00:06:49,615 --> 00:06:52,025
'all of you.

90
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:55,280
'I did it to protect you.'

91
00:06:55,315 --> 00:06:58,500
What you talking about?

92
00:06:58,535 --> 00:07:02,500
Nothing.

93
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:26,860
So this photo in the magazine.
Is that actually you?

94
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:29,745
Is it?

95
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:32,960
So do you get any training?

96
00:08:32,995 --> 00:08:36,140
I'm just making conversation.

97
00:08:36,175 --> 00:08:38,237
I'll call you back, OK.

98
00:08:38,272 --> 00:08:40,265
I'm looking for Sally.

99
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:42,300
Who?
She's a probation worker.

100
00:08:42,335 --> 00:08:44,980
Oh, haven't seen her, man.

101
00:08:45,015 --> 00:08:48,980
Can I take a message?

102
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:52,020
You're all right.

103
00:08:52,055 --> 00:08:55,265
OK.

104
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:08,025
What's he doing here?

105
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:12,060
Who is he?
He's police.

106
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:15,465
Morning!

107
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:19,500
What is up with that?

108
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:31,440
You want to tell me what's going on?

109
00:09:31,475 --> 00:09:35,440
What's with the makeover?

110
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,040
If you dress like a slut,
people will treat you like a slut.

111
00:09:39,075 --> 00:09:40,637
What's happened to you?

112
00:09:40,672 --> 00:09:42,165
I'm sorting my life out.

113
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:44,525
All the drugs and the drink-driving.

114
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:47,300
I've done so many things
I'm ashamed of.

115
00:09:47,335 --> 00:09:49,787
And I...
touched myself in front of you.

116
00:09:49,822 --> 00:09:52,205
I'm pretty sure
you enjoyed it.

117
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:55,885
Well, I shouldn't be masturbating
in public toilets.

118
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:58,720
I'm saving myself until I'm ready
to make a proper commitment.

119
00:09:58,755 --> 00:10:02,280
It's a bit late for that.
No, it's never too late.

120
00:10:02,315 --> 00:10:04,680
And it's not too late
for you either.

121
00:10:04,715 --> 00:10:06,965
'Lisha, what is this?

122
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,220
Has it got something to do
with that lot we saw yesterday?

123
00:10:10,255 --> 00:10:13,440
You should come to our meeting.
Did they do something to you?

124
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:17,880
You used to have so much going
for you. You threw it all away.

125
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:21,920
So pathetic.

126
00:10:21,955 --> 00:10:25,680
This isn't you.

127
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:31,280
We can help you, Curtis.

128
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:43,285
Excuse me.

129
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:47,320
You know using marijuana can cause
epilepsy and mental illness?

130
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:52,620
I'm talking to you!

131
00:10:52,655 --> 00:10:55,445
What's wrong with you?

132
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:58,600
You don't need
to behave like this.

133
00:10:58,635 --> 00:11:02,017
You can be so much better.

134
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:15,280
Nice cardigan!

135
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:20,120
She's saying all this weird
stuff about sex and that.

136
00:11:20,155 --> 00:11:21,725
She says she's saving herself

137
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:24,800
until she's ready
to make a proper commitment.

138
00:11:24,835 --> 00:11:27,165
It's a sad day for all of us

139
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,440
when a bird like that decides
it's time to pull up her knickers.

140
00:11:29,475 --> 00:11:31,560
You realise that's my girlfriend
you're talking about?

141
00:11:31,595 --> 00:11:32,765
And I feel your pain.

142
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:35,125
Wash your hands before you touch me.

143
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:39,160
Have you finished?
The beast is back in his cage.

144
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:41,965
He is sleeping.

145
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,000
It's that lot we saw yesterday.
She's dressing like that.

146
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:47,845
They did something to her.

147
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:49,320
What, like brainwashing or
something?

148
00:11:49,355 --> 00:11:50,525
It's the storm.

149
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:52,920
How d'you know that?
You don't know that?

150
00:11:52,955 --> 00:11:55,280
When weird stuff happens,
it's always the storm.

151
00:11:55,315 --> 00:11:57,480
Haven't you worked that out yet?

152
00:11:57,515 --> 00:11:58,925
He's got a point.

153
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:02,725
Did you just suddenly grow
a set of balls?

154
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:06,200
I've always had a set of balls.
You've just never seen them.

155
00:12:06,235 --> 00:12:09,485
That is about the gayest thing
I've ever heard.

156
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:13,520
Shut up. We need to find out
what's going on with her.

157
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:37,805
Alisha?

158
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:41,840
What are you doing?
Waiting for you.

159
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,320
Alisha!

160
00:12:47,355 --> 00:12:50,017
Get off me!

161
00:12:50,052 --> 00:12:52,680
Alisha!

162
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:41,685
I got pizza.

163
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:44,120
Why do you give Simon so much grief?
Leave him alone, yeah?

164
00:13:44,155 --> 00:13:45,805
I'm just screwing around.

165
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:48,760
Well, it's not screwing around to
him. There's stuff going on with him.

166
00:13:48,795 --> 00:13:50,325
Do you love him?

167
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:54,085
Ow! Jesus.
Just leave it, then.

168
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:58,120
All right, touchy.
I'll leave your boyfriend alone.

169
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:03,720
Is that a sock? Aw, it's crusty.

170
00:14:03,755 --> 00:14:06,085
Ah, don't put it on my pizza.

171
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:09,320
Why are you sleeping with
a crusty sock in your bed?

172
00:14:09,355 --> 00:14:12,480
All right. Yes. It's my wank sock.

173
00:14:12,515 --> 00:14:15,165
Oh, no! Use some tissue!

174
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:18,040
That requires planning.
Who's that organised?

175
00:14:18,075 --> 00:14:19,325
Oh, don't use a sock.

176
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:21,760
Look, you've just
knocked one out, right?

177
00:14:21,795 --> 00:14:22,845
Poom-byo!

178
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:26,360
You're lying there,
you're feeling cheap and deflated.

179
00:14:26,395 --> 00:14:29,840
There's a pool of rapidly cooling
spunk on your stomach.

180
00:14:29,875 --> 00:14:31,880
You're looking round
for something to mop up with.

181
00:14:31,915 --> 00:14:34,560
Oh, hello. What's this? It's a sock.

182
00:14:34,595 --> 00:14:36,637
Job done. Thank you.

183
00:14:36,672 --> 00:14:38,716
Maybe that's your power.

184
00:14:38,751 --> 00:14:40,725
I am very good at it.

185
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:43,800
Have you had any more ideas
what it could be yet?

186
00:14:43,835 --> 00:14:45,977
I give up. I obviously
haven't got one.

187
00:14:46,012 --> 00:14:48,085
It's bullshit.
Where's the logic, huh?

188
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:50,840
You're better off without it.
They're a pain in the arse.

189
00:14:50,875 --> 00:14:53,325
You know why it is, though?

190
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:56,160
Because you can't improve on
perfection.

191
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:01,680
Look, but don't touch.

192
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:08,640
'Don't think about shagging her.
Don't think about shagging her.

193
00:15:08,675 --> 00:15:11,120
'You're thinking about shagging her.
You're an idiot.'

194
00:15:11,155 --> 00:15:12,645
You heard that, didn't you?

195
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:15,200
I'm a man.
We think about shagging everyone.

196
00:15:15,235 --> 00:15:17,685
Thanks a lot!
I didn't mean it like that.

197
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:21,720
You are so shit at this.
How do you ever get laid?

198
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:26,200
I...get girls really, really drunk.

199
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,365
So...

200
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:36,400
do you wanna steal some booze?

201
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:43,280
I should really have
my own keys cut for the bar.

202
00:15:47,015 --> 00:15:48,645
Get off me!

203
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:54,120
Is it just me, or does
this look really suspicious?

204
00:15:54,155 --> 00:15:58,120
Alisha!
Get off me!

205
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:03,285
It's Curtis!

206
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:05,005
No, there's too many of them.

207
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:06,640
And I'm not very good at fighting.

208
00:16:06,675 --> 00:16:10,640
I never have been.

209
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:17,600
What's she saying to them?
Fuck knows.

210
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:24,880
Did she just...virginise him?

211
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,680
She's put one of those ribbons
on him. They're all wearing 'em.

212
00:16:29,715 --> 00:16:33,680
You mean one of these ribbons?

213
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:43,645
Burn it! Burn it!

214
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:47,200
Burn the drugs!
Free yourself!

215
00:16:47,235 --> 00:16:48,005
Burn the drugs!

216
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:50,440
Burn the drugs!

217
00:16:50,475 --> 00:16:53,925
Bravo!

218
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:57,960
Burn the dildo!

219
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:04,805
Have you seen Curtis?

220
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:07,040
They got him last night
in the community centre.

221
00:17:07,075 --> 00:17:08,485
There was some spooky shit.

222
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:12,520
It's her. She's doing this to them.

223
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,840
What are the aims of your
organisation?

224
00:17:15,875 --> 00:17:18,577
We're trying to encourage
self-respect,

225
00:17:18,612 --> 00:17:21,280
responsible behaviour,
respect for the law.

226
00:17:21,315 --> 00:17:23,605
What's so wrong with being good?

227
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:26,485
Do you have a message
for the young people watching?

228
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:30,520
All this drinking, and the drugs
and the anti-social behaviour.

229
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:34,880
You don't need to behave like this.

230
00:17:34,915 --> 00:17:38,880
You can be so much better.

231
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:44,245
Where is she?

232
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:47,600
Ah, there's never a probation worker
around when you need one.

233
00:17:47,635 --> 00:17:51,400
You were sucking up to her
last week. Where is she?

234
00:17:51,435 --> 00:17:52,565
I don't know.

235
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:54,125
We need to tell someone
what she's doing.

236
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:57,640
Oh, yeah. Right. "Help!
Everyone's stopped taking drugs,

237
00:17:57,675 --> 00:18:00,000
"and urinating in the street."
Who are we gonna tell?

238
00:18:00,035 --> 00:18:03,445
This is every policeman
and parent's wet dream.

239
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:06,560
C'mon, Barry. You're good at this
stuff. Think of something.

240
00:18:06,595 --> 00:18:08,717
Who's Barry?

241
00:18:08,752 --> 00:18:10,805
You are.

242
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:13,720
His name is Simon.
Is it?

243
00:18:13,755 --> 00:18:16,640
I thought it was Barry.

244
00:18:16,675 --> 00:18:18,325
Sorry, man.

245
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:20,760
It's Curtis and Alisha out there.
It's down to us.

246
00:18:20,795 --> 00:18:24,160
No-one else is gonna do shit.

247
00:18:24,195 --> 00:18:25,885
Oh, shit!

248
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:28,445
We need to get her away from here.

249
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:30,300
We need to find out
what they've done to her.

250
00:18:30,335 --> 00:18:32,407
What about her power?
We can't touch her.

251
00:18:32,442 --> 00:18:34,445
And what if that "virtue bitch"
shows up?

252
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:38,480
She's vexing them with some kind
of Derren Brown voodoo mind shit.

253
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,720
We need to gear up.

254
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:57,165
What are you doing?

255
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:59,880
You gotta have the right track
for this kind of thing.

256
00:18:59,915 --> 00:19:02,560
You need something up-tempo,
with a bit of edge to it.

257
00:19:02,595 --> 00:19:05,325
I'm thinking Jay-Z,
maybe a bit of Dizzee.

258
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:07,920
You could be getting into
a whole race thing...

259
00:19:07,955 --> 00:19:10,480
Just pick one, for fuck's sake.
Oh, hold on.

260
00:19:10,515 --> 00:19:12,005
Oh, yes.

261
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:14,800
That's the baby.

262
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,765
We'll take her out
through the fire exit.

263
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:39,080
You two go round the back,
check nobody's there. Don't screw up.

264
00:19:39,115 --> 00:19:41,497
I won't.

265
00:19:41,532 --> 00:19:43,845
Let's do it.

266
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Have you seen Alisha?
I have just shat my guts out.

267
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:05,400
Why are you wearing rubber gloves?

268
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:08,760
I like your shoes...

269
00:20:08,795 --> 00:20:10,965
Brown.
What?

270
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,880
What are you two up to?
I got to go to the chemists.

271
00:20:13,915 --> 00:20:17,880
I'll catch you later, big boy.

272
00:20:37,715 --> 00:20:40,645
Kelly?

273
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:44,280
Kelly! Curtis saw us.
I think he's onto us.

274
00:20:44,315 --> 00:20:45,925
How's she supposed to hear us?
What?

275
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:49,960
That girl, she's brainwashing you.
Come with us and we can help you.

276
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:52,360
Kelly! Turn your iPod off!

277
00:20:52,395 --> 00:20:53,925
Kelly!

278
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:57,960
You've got it all wrong. You're the
one that needs help. Come to our meetings.

279
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:03,760
Kelly, what are you doing?
Get off!

280
00:21:03,795 --> 00:21:05,405
Alisha? Alisha? Are you in there?

281
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:07,920
It's Kelly!
She's trying to take me somewhere!

282
00:21:07,955 --> 00:21:10,765
They're trying to take Alisha.

283
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:13,200
There's a girl called Kelly
in there with her.

284
00:21:13,235 --> 00:21:14,325
Nathan!

285
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:18,360
Kelly! Open the door!

286
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:20,565
Kelly!

287
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:24,480
Kelly, listen to me.
You don't need to behave like this.

288
00:21:24,515 --> 00:21:26,685
You can be so much better.

289
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:29,240
She can't hear you.
She's listening to music.

290
00:21:29,275 --> 00:21:31,080
Alisha. Rip her earphones out!

291
00:21:31,115 --> 00:21:32,205
Nathan!

292
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:36,085
Open the door!

293
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:38,480
Kelly, they're coming for her!
Leave her!

294
00:21:38,515 --> 00:21:41,957
Nathan! Nathan!

295
00:21:41,992 --> 00:21:45,400
We can help you!

296
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:47,685
Go!
We have to go.

297
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:49,160
I'm not leaving her! Kelly!

298
00:21:49,195 --> 00:21:53,160
Come on!
Shit!

299
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:05,160
They're coming for you.
They're gonna turn you retarded.

300
00:22:05,195 --> 00:22:06,685
You're next! You're next!

301
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:10,720
You should come
to one of our meetings.

302
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:22,280
They're everywhere!

303
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:37,765
Come on, use your power. Save us.

304
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:40,360
After everything you've done to me,
you want me to save you?

305
00:22:40,395 --> 00:22:44,360
Yes. Get on with it, you little
freak!

306
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:51,125
You're gonna save yourself?

307
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:54,600
You selfish bastard!
I'll remember this!

308
00:22:54,635 --> 00:22:58,600
I thought we were friends!

309
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:06,560
Just back the fuck up!

310
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:16,920
Get on!

311
00:23:21,555 --> 00:23:25,080
Fuck you!

312
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:39,200
Who are you?

313
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:43,445
Thanks for saving me and everything.

314
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:47,480
You could've just
stopped and let me off.

315
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:03,605
Kelly. It's me. Where are you?

316
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:05,580
Answer your phone.
I'm losing it here!

317
00:24:05,615 --> 00:24:07,080
I'm freaking out!

318
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:12,560
Call me, yeah?

319
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:19,500
Graffiti isn't art,
it's vandalism.

320
00:25:12,780 --> 00:25:14,080
Kelly?

321
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:23,800
Kelly?

322
00:25:38,420 --> 00:25:40,540
Nathan?

323
00:25:40,575 --> 00:25:42,325
Oh, no.

324
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:43,580
Why are you in my bedroom?

325
00:25:43,615 --> 00:25:45,800
What did they do to you?

326
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:49,485
I think I look nice.

327
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:52,880
OK. Yeah. I suppose you could argue
it's a huge improvement.

328
00:25:52,915 --> 00:25:55,720
I get that. It's not you.

329
00:25:55,755 --> 00:25:57,165
That's a good thing.

330
00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:00,060
I had a terrible attitude.
I was so aggressive.

331
00:26:00,095 --> 00:26:02,507
Yes, but in a good way.
You're the only person

332
00:26:02,542 --> 00:26:04,920
who gives me a slap.
There's no bullshit with you.

333
00:26:04,955 --> 00:26:06,737
I was a horrible chav.

334
00:26:06,772 --> 00:26:08,520
I didn't like who I was.

335
00:26:08,555 --> 00:26:11,405
I... I did.

336
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:13,920
I can't believe
I'm going to say this.

337
00:26:13,955 --> 00:26:16,965
I liked your attitude.

338
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:20,180
I liked how you looked -
the way you scraped your hair back

339
00:26:20,215 --> 00:26:23,360
so sometimes you looked
a bit oriental. It worked for me.

340
00:26:23,395 --> 00:26:27,320
And your jewellery,
you know, Argos has a bad press.

341
00:26:27,355 --> 00:26:29,857
Who says you can't buy
an engagement ring

342
00:26:29,892 --> 00:26:32,360
and a George Foreman Grill
at the same time?

343
00:26:32,395 --> 00:26:35,285
Your make-up...

344
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:37,765
This is probably better, actually...

345
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:41,680
Look, what I'm trying
to say here is that

346
00:26:41,715 --> 00:26:45,560
it should've been
a complete car crash.

347
00:26:45,595 --> 00:26:47,637
But it wasn't.

348
00:26:47,672 --> 00:26:49,680
It had attitude.

349
00:26:49,715 --> 00:26:50,925
Like you.

350
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:54,960
It was you and now you're not...

351
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:58,885
you.

352
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:00,325
Look at ya.

353
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:02,285
You haven't achieved anything.

354
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:04,320
You're a waste of space.
You're such a loser.

355
00:27:04,355 --> 00:27:05,720
There's no need to get personal.

356
00:27:05,755 --> 00:27:06,885
We can help you.

357
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:10,920
I never...
should've left you back there.

358
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:16,240
I shouldn't have left you.
I'm sorry.

359
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:21,880
That was really inappropriate.

360
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:49,480
The train now
approaching platform one is the...

361
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:45,840
Good morning.

362
00:28:45,875 --> 00:28:47,137
Good morning.

363
00:28:47,172 --> 00:28:48,365
All right?

364
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:52,400
Beautiful weather, isn't it?

365
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:17,245
Nathan.

366
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:20,040
I'm so glad you're with us now.

367
00:29:20,075 --> 00:29:21,685
I'm so pleased to be here.

368
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:24,880
I was such a loser.
The drugs, the sex...

369
00:29:24,915 --> 00:29:28,005
all that fast food.
I was so miserable.

370
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:32,040
I hear you.
You were such an annoying idiot.

371
00:29:32,075 --> 00:29:33,205
What's this?

372
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:36,040
Oh, it's a petition. We're
campaigning against contraceptives

373
00:29:36,075 --> 00:29:39,645
being given out in schools.
Will you sign it?

374
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:43,680
There's only one thing young ladies
should be inserting in themselves...

375
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:48,080
and that's knowledge.

376
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:55,360
Please excuse me.

377
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:35,245
Change them back to how they were.

378
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:38,965
OK. Just stay calm.
What's your name?

379
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:42,920
Your voodoo won't work on me.
I can't hear a word you're saying.

380
00:30:42,955 --> 00:30:45,280
Now, whatever you did
to them, undo it.

381
00:30:45,315 --> 00:30:46,445
They're better off as they are...

382
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:50,480
They're better off as they are...

383
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:52,600
..Everyone was teasing me
for being a virgin...

384
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:57,800
..I'm a nice person
and they treated me like a freak.

385
00:30:57,835 --> 00:30:59,160
Blah blah blah. Change them back.

386
00:30:59,195 --> 00:31:01,165
I can't.

387
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:02,525
I can't, even if I wanted to!

388
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:04,200
I can't, even if I wanted to!
I'm gonna shoot you in the face.

389
00:31:04,235 --> 00:31:05,560
I don't understand how it works.

390
00:31:05,595 --> 00:31:06,645
What's that?

391
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:07,965
This is ridiculous!

392
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:12,000
You think I won't do this?
I will put a bullet in your skull!

393
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:14,405
Nathan?

394
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:15,925
Nathan, what are you doing?

395
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:18,820
I'm gonna stop this.
She did this to you.

396
00:31:18,855 --> 00:31:21,680
Are you reading
a university prospectus?

397
00:31:21,715 --> 00:31:25,680
Oh, Jesus! This ends now.

398
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:28,925
Kelly?

399
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:30,725
Kelly, don't!

400
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:34,760
Help! Someone help me!

401
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:39,000
Everybody stay the fuck down
or I will shoot her in the face.

402
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:43,000
You, down, down now. Stay down!

403
00:31:43,035 --> 00:31:44,400
Everybody, stay down.

404
00:31:44,435 --> 00:31:46,045
Get back.

405
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:49,480
No funny stuff. Get up!

406
00:31:49,515 --> 00:31:53,480
Everybody down!

407
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:58,320
In there.

408
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:09,640
Stay there!

409
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:13,960
Where are you gonna go?

410
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:24,160
Nathan, please just let her go.

411
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:28,200
She's got you thinking
this is how you're supposed to be.

412
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:30,445
Well, it's not!

413
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:33,405
We're young.
We're supposed to drink too much.

414
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:37,440
We're supposed to have bad attitudes
and shag each other's brains out.

415
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:41,600
We are designed to party.
This is it.

416
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:47,080
Yeah, so a few of us
will overdose or go mental.

417
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:51,525
But Charles Darwin said

418
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:54,240
you can't make an omelette
without breaking a few eggs.

419
00:32:54,275 --> 00:32:58,045
And that's what it's all about -
breaking eggs!

420
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:02,080
And by eggs, I do mean, getting
twatted on a cocktail of Class As.

421
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:07,365
If you could just see yourselves!

422
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:11,400
It breaks my heart.
You're wearing cardigans!

423
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:13,485
We had it all.

424
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:17,520
We fucked up bigger and better than
any generation that came before us.

425
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:23,400
We were so beautiful!

426
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:29,000
We're screw-ups.

427
00:33:29,035 --> 00:33:31,325
I'm a screw-up

428
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:35,360
and I plan to be a screw-up
until my late 20s,

429
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:38,005
maybe even my early 30s.

430
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:41,040
And I will shag my own mother
before I let her...

431
00:33:41,075 --> 00:33:45,040
or anyone else
take that away from me!

432
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:50,445
Your gun's leaking.

433
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:53,245
So you threatened me
with a water pistol!

434
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:55,520
You're just like the rest of them,
aren't you?

435
00:33:55,555 --> 00:33:57,160
You'd be so much happier if you...

436
00:33:57,195 --> 00:33:59,960
I still can't hear you.

437
00:33:59,995 --> 00:34:01,605
Oh! You idiot!

438
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:05,640
All right, love, calm down.
Honk, honk, honk!

439
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:14,520
Save me, Barry!

440
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:31,120
What am I wearing?

441
00:34:31,155 --> 00:34:32,920
What are you wearing?

442
00:34:32,955 --> 00:34:35,177
Where's Nathan?

443
00:34:37,435 --> 00:34:40,280
Nathan! No!

444
00:34:40,315 --> 00:34:41,445
No.

445
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:45,160
Rewind time.
Stop this happening. Do it!

446
00:34:45,195 --> 00:34:46,765
I don't know how to do it!

447
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:50,800
You got to save him.
He's not allowed to die!

448
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,665
We should go celebrate.

449
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:23,600
Not celebrate like, "Whoo! I'm
so happy!" Just like, you know...

450
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:29,360
Can we just go for a drink?

451
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:40,100
Kelly...

452
00:36:40,535 --> 00:36:42,040
Come on.

453
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:04,960
To Nathan.

454
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:11,240
Prick.

455
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:14,845
'Up on the roof.

456
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:17,725
'I tried to save him.

457
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:20,040
'There was nothing I could do.

458
00:37:20,075 --> 00:37:24,040
'I'm sorry.'

459
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:26,525
I'm gonna go.

460
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:29,200
Stay for another drink.

461
00:37:29,235 --> 00:37:31,840
I'll see you Monday.

462
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:42,240
I'm gonna go too.

463
00:37:42,275 --> 00:37:44,840
See you later.

464
00:37:44,875 --> 00:37:48,840
Later.

465
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:43,800
Kelly.

466
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:47,680
This is for you.

467
00:38:47,715 --> 00:38:50,337
What is it?

468
00:38:50,372 --> 00:38:52,960
Watch it.

469
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:17,405
Pervert!

470
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:20,400
He's trying to kiss me!
He's trying to kiss me!

471
00:39:20,435 --> 00:39:20,765
Give it back!

472
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:21,880
Give it back!
Ow, stop hitting me!

473
00:39:21,915 --> 00:39:24,317
Cock, anus, bit of ball sack...

474
00:39:24,352 --> 00:39:26,685
If I was trying to wind you up,

475
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:28,960
I think I'd be
a little bit more creative.

476
00:39:28,995 --> 00:39:30,937
I know what film
you saw last summer.

477
00:39:30,972 --> 00:39:32,845
Where are the other
ASBO shitheads?

478
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:36,400
Well done! Really, I'm touched,
I've got a lump in my throat.

479
00:39:36,435 --> 00:39:37,517
Twat!

480
00:39:37,552 --> 00:39:38,565
Pervert!

481
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:39,685
Melon-fucker!

482
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:43,720
I've got a power, I know it,
I can feel it in my balls.

483
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:52,080
I wasn't ready.

484
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:55,960
Where are the brakes on this thing?
Oh, shit!

485
00:39:58,840 --> 00:40:02,440
So do we have a deal?

486
00:40:02,475 --> 00:40:06,165
High five!

487
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:10,200
Oh, come on, I was only joking.
You'll regret this!

488
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,485
Classic!

489
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:04,000
Ah, I'm alive.

490
00:41:04,035 --> 00:41:07,080
I didn't die.

491
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:13,280
I'm immortal.

492
00:41:14,120 --> 00:41:15,765
That's it!

493
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:18,045
I've got a power!

494
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:21,120
I bloody knew it. I've got a power!

495
00:41:21,155 --> 00:41:25,120
Ha-ha! Who's laughing now?

496
00:41:29,560 --> 00:41:31,180
Help!

497
00:41:32,742 --> 00:41:34,165
Help!

498
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:36,800
I'm alive!

499
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:40,920
You buried me alive, you dicks!

500
00:41:40,955 --> 00:41:44,920
Help!

501
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:55,565
I'm immortal.

502
00:41:55,600 --> 00:41:59,600
That's just great!
Thank you, thanks a lot!

503
00:42:13,080 --> 00:42:16,020
Un-fucking-believable!
