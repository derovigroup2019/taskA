1
00:00:01,460 --> 00:00:03,580
- What is that?
- The storm, the lightning!

2
00:00:03,615 --> 00:00:05,305
It's just done something to us.

3
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:08,340
Something's happened
to me too. I turned invisible.

4
00:00:08,375 --> 00:00:11,105
Look at me!

5
00:00:11,140 --> 00:00:13,665
All I have to do is touch you.

6
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:16,180
They'll think the probation
worker's still alive.

7
00:00:16,215 --> 00:00:19,277
Someone must be using his credit
card. It's them.

8
00:00:19,312 --> 00:00:22,340
I saw you with that girl.
It just happened, like.

9
00:00:22,375 --> 00:00:25,497
I didn't mean it to.

10
00:00:25,532 --> 00:00:28,620
My life is fucked
and that's on you.

11
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:38,705
Pervert!
What are you doing?

12
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:42,740
Give it back.
Come on, we'll do an interview.

13
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:47,340
First question. Have you
ever had sex with a piece of fruit?

14
00:00:47,740 --> 00:00:51,740
Give me my phone.
Second question. Was it a melon?

15
00:00:52,220 --> 00:00:55,385
Ah, he's trying to kiss me!

16
00:00:55,420 --> 00:00:57,540
He's trying to kiss me!
Just give it back!

17
00:00:57,575 --> 00:00:59,660
Give him his phone back,
you prick.

18
00:00:59,695 --> 00:01:01,905
Ow, stop hitting me!

19
00:01:01,940 --> 00:01:04,980
Have your little toy. Melon-fucker!

20
00:01:05,015 --> 00:01:08,025
Don't touch my phone.

21
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:10,820
He's got Tony's credit card.
It was in here.

22
00:01:10,855 --> 00:01:12,265
Why did you put it back?

23
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:14,620
You need to catch him using it.
It's evidence against him.

24
00:01:14,655 --> 00:01:16,225
Sally...
It's here somewhere.

25
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:18,940
Even if we catch him using it,
it doesn't prove he murdered Tony.

26
00:01:18,975 --> 00:01:21,220
How else would he have got it?
Maybe he found it.

27
00:01:21,255 --> 00:01:23,585
The most we can do him for is fraud.

28
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:26,980
Sally, stop. He'll know someone's
been in there.

29
00:01:27,015 --> 00:01:29,625
Sally!

30
00:01:29,660 --> 00:01:33,060
You keep this up,
you're gonna lose your job.

31
00:01:33,095 --> 00:01:36,257
I know this is difficult.

32
00:01:36,292 --> 00:01:39,420
He's got Tony's credit card.

33
00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:43,580
I'm sorry. It's not enough.

34

35
00:02:41,095 --> 00:02:42,785
What is this?

36
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:46,060
This is your chance to talk
about community service.

37
00:02:46,095 --> 00:02:49,305
It's... bullshit.

38
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:52,260
So do you think
that you've learned anything?

39
00:02:52,295 --> 00:02:56,140
Yeah. Don't get caught.

40
00:02:56,175 --> 00:02:57,145
Fine.

41
00:02:57,180 --> 00:03:01,180
How do you think you've changed?
Um...

42
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:05,025
I think I'm taller.

43
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:09,060
They graffiti and we clean it off.
They graffiti and we clean it off.

44
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:12,180
They graffiti and we clean it off.
What is that about?

45
00:03:13,815 --> 00:03:14,785
Hello?

46
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:16,380
Rough in the jungle,
innit, in the jungle?

47
00:03:16,415 --> 00:03:18,140
Rough in the jungle,
innit, in the jungle?

48
00:03:18,175 --> 00:03:21,705
You're fuckin' lying!

49
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:25,140
Do I look like I'm some kind
of fuckin' knob?

50
00:03:25,175 --> 00:03:28,145
Do I?

51
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:31,060
It's not easy, being you, is it?

52
00:03:31,095 --> 00:03:33,745
What do you mean?

53
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:36,060
I mean, how do you get along
with the others?

54
00:03:36,095 --> 00:03:39,060
It must be hard.
You're not like them.

55
00:03:39,095 --> 00:03:43,060
You're more... mature.

56
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:46,425
Why has he been in there longer
than the rest of us?

57
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:50,460
He's obviously making more progress.
He's such a little arse-kisser.

58
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:56,340
So have you thought about what you
want to do when this is over?

59
00:03:57,100 --> 00:03:59,465
I don't know.

60
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:02,300
Would you like to go to college
or get a j...?

61
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:11,265
He's such a twat.

62
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:13,500
Sorry, that was really
unprofessional.

63
00:04:13,535 --> 00:04:17,500
He is a twat.

64
00:04:18,580 --> 00:04:20,980
So what do you like doing?
Come on, there must be something.

65
00:04:21,015 --> 00:04:24,777
I like making videos,
editing them together and that.

66
00:04:24,812 --> 00:04:28,540
Really? Well, I have a friend
who runs an editing suite.

67
00:04:28,575 --> 00:04:30,620
I could ask him about some work
experience for you,

68
00:04:30,655 --> 00:04:32,140
if that's what you're interested in.

69
00:04:32,175 --> 00:04:34,385
Yeah.

70
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:38,420
There's no need to look so shocked.
I'm not that bad, am I?

71
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:43,220
- No.
- I should do some work.

72
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:52,220
Thank you.

73
00:04:52,255 --> 00:04:54,145
For what?

74
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:58,180
It's nice there's someone I can
actually have a conversation with.

75
00:04:58,260 --> 00:05:02,260
Thanks.

76
00:05:18,140 --> 00:05:21,465
We never did find out who was putting
notes in our lockers.

77
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:24,865
What did I say? I said they had
nothing. They were just pissing

78
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:28,460
You don't know what they got on us.
Maybe they're watching us right now.

79
00:05:28,495 --> 00:05:30,105
This shit is old news.

80
00:05:30,140 --> 00:05:34,140
We have outfoxed the fox,
which makes us very bloody foxy.

81
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:38,065
You like that, huh? Yeah.

82
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:41,500
- Do you wanna come to mine tonight?
- Can't. Gotta baby-sit my nephew.

83
00:05:41,535 --> 00:05:43,745
How about I come with you?

84
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:47,780
My aunt and uncle are well religious.
Don't even have a TV cos of all the sex.

85
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:50,840
Man, they take one look at you...

86
00:05:50,875 --> 00:05:53,580
Are you saying I look dirty?
Yeah.

87
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:09,900
I thought that was you.
D'you want a lift?

88
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:13,940
I'm offering you a lift, Simon.
It's not illegal.

89
00:06:13,975 --> 00:06:17,940
Get in.

90
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:31,220
Hey.

91
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:39,900
Let's go somewhere quiet.
OK.

92
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:48,900
Why are you looking at me like that?

93
00:06:48,935 --> 00:06:52,900
I can't see you any more.

94
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:56,140
Are you finishing with me?
I'm sorry.

95
00:06:56,175 --> 00:06:59,745
Tell me why. Tell me.

96
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:03,140
There are things going on with me,
things I can't tell you about.

97
00:07:03,175 --> 00:07:06,340
What things?
It's nothing you've done. It's me.

98
00:07:06,375 --> 00:07:07,705
I've changed.

99
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:09,440
No, you can't do this to me.

100
00:07:09,475 --> 00:07:11,140
Don't do this.
I'm sorry.

101
00:07:11,175 --> 00:07:15,140
Please.

102
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:29,700
Why are you looking at me like that?

103
00:07:29,735 --> 00:07:33,020
It's nothing.

104
00:07:33,055 --> 00:07:37,020
Nothing.

105
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:41,580
Let's get a drink.

106
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:49,700
So what's going on
with Curtis and Alisha?

107
00:07:49,735 --> 00:07:52,297
Oh, come on. I'm not blind.

108
00:07:52,332 --> 00:07:54,860
Are they seeing each other?

109
00:07:54,895 --> 00:07:56,465
I suppose so.

110
00:07:56,500 --> 00:08:00,500
Well, Alisha's a very
beautiful girl, isn't she?

111
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:08,340
So what else do you lot get up to
when I'm not around?

112
00:08:08,375 --> 00:08:10,817
Nothing.

113
00:08:10,852 --> 00:08:13,225
Really?

114
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:17,260
It's OK. I'm not sure
I wanna know, anyway.

115
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:31,540
So are you up to anything exciting
this evening?

116
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:36,340
I'll probably just go online.
How about you?

117
00:08:36,980 --> 00:08:40,980
I'll watch some television,
get an early night.

118
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:45,105
God, I sound boring.

119
00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:46,780
I don't think you're boring.

120
00:08:46,815 --> 00:08:50,780
Thanks.

121
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:55,980
See you tomorrow.

122
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:36,400
- What if I can talk to animals?
- Why would you even think that?

123
00:10:36,435 --> 00:10:39,400
I saw this basset hound
eating a kebab off the pavement.

124
00:10:39,435 --> 00:10:40,805
I was like, "You dirty bastard,"

125
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:44,765
and this basset hound
gave me a right funny look.

126
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:48,340
- He probably thought you were a twat.
- No, it wasn't that kind of look.

127
00:10:48,375 --> 00:10:51,880
It was more like, "Are you talking
to me?" "Are you talking to me?"

128
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:02,840
See? Babies.
That's why I always use a condom.

129
00:11:02,875 --> 00:11:05,840
And if the girl looks dirty,
I use two.

130
00:11:05,875 --> 00:11:09,840
Belt and braces.

131
00:11:46,075 --> 00:11:50,040
Who's that?

132
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:54,160
It's a mate.

133
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:12,000
Come on, let's go again.
Really?

134
00:12:12,035 --> 00:12:14,440
I'm good to go.

135
00:12:14,475 --> 00:12:16,165
Hey, you seen Curtis?

136
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:19,000
Who are you?
I'm his girlfriend.

137
00:12:19,035 --> 00:12:21,377
Do you know where he is?

138
00:12:21,412 --> 00:12:23,685
Uh...he's been arrested.

139
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:27,160
What for?
For...exposing himself.

140
00:12:27,195 --> 00:12:29,680
What?
Yeah, flashing.

141
00:12:29,715 --> 00:12:31,165
At some Scouts.

142
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:35,045
Try tying a knot in that!
Or maybe you have.

143
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:37,840
Very funny. When you see him,
can you get him to call Sam?

144
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:43,480
She seems nice.

145
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Your girlfriend was here.
The other one.

146
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:54,205
We covered for you, though.

147
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:57,240
I always wanted to be a cheat.
I'm just too disorganised.

148
00:12:57,275 --> 00:12:59,445
I struggle to remember
one girl's name.

149
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:02,720
It's not like that.
I've tried to finish with Sam.

150
00:13:02,755 --> 00:13:04,897
I tell her it's over,
she starts to cry

151
00:13:04,932 --> 00:13:07,040
and you know what it's like
when girls cry.

152
00:13:07,075 --> 00:13:09,005
Horrible.
I feel so guilty.

153
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:11,725
Time rewinds
and it's like I never said it.

154
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:15,760
I've ended it six times.
She cries, I'm back where I started.

155
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:18,520
It's doing my head in.
I just need it to be over.

156
00:13:18,555 --> 00:13:20,925
You need to make her hate you.

157
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:24,960
Seriously. She's steaming, she's
telling you you've got a tiny dick,

158
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:26,845
you're crap in bed.

159
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:30,880
You don't feel guilty,
maybe time won't rewind.

160
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:34,540
You gotta be brutal, man.
Get her riled.

161
00:13:34,575 --> 00:13:37,160
Tell her she's got
nasty snatch gunk.

162
00:13:37,195 --> 00:13:39,485
I don't even know what that is.

163
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:42,880
You know, it's the...
it's the stuff that comes out.

164
00:13:42,915 --> 00:13:44,525
Oh! I'm not saying that.

165
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:47,440
She hasn't done nothing wrong.
I can't hurt her.

166
00:13:47,475 --> 00:13:49,765
I hear you, man.

167
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:53,800
Don't put your arm around me.

168
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:58,480
It's these powers, man.

169
00:13:58,515 --> 00:14:00,725
No matter what you do,

170
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:04,760
the ones you love
will be the ones who pay.

171
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:10,480
Right.

172
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:14,680
See you later, chief.

173
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:51,000
Who are you?

174
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:55,560
Hello.

175
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:59,400
Who are you?

176
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:04,600
Finn?

177
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:08,440
Where did you go, eh?

178
00:15:08,475 --> 00:15:09,685
Come here.

179
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:12,400
He's always crawling off.
He's beautiful.

180
00:15:12,435 --> 00:15:13,725
Oh, thanks.

181
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:16,120
- What's his name?
- Finn.

182
00:15:16,155 --> 00:15:18,480
Finn. So how old is he?

183
00:15:18,515 --> 00:15:19,885
Nine months.

184
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:21,445
He must take a lot of looking after.

185
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:24,960
Yeah, just a bit. Only had two
hours' sleep last night, didn't I?

186
00:15:24,995 --> 00:15:27,320
Is there no-one to help you?
Where's his dad?

187
00:15:27,355 --> 00:15:29,245
Uh, he's not around.

188
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:33,280
Really? Can I...? Can I hold him?
Maybe I could play with him for a while.

189
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:35,565
Huh? We could hang out.

190
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:38,880
Nathan! What the hell are you doing?

191
00:15:38,915 --> 00:15:41,640
I found a baby.

192
00:15:41,675 --> 00:15:43,085
Bye, Finn!

193
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:45,820
Did you see him?

194
00:15:45,855 --> 00:15:48,485
He is beautiful.

195
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:51,360
Are you taking the piss?

196
00:15:51,395 --> 00:15:55,360
No.

197
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:14,840
Simon.

198
00:16:14,875 --> 00:16:17,005
Hi.

199
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:19,880
I've spoken to a few people
about getting you work experience.

200
00:16:19,915 --> 00:16:23,880
They're gonna come back to me.
Thanks.

201
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:27,525
Are you OK?

202
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:31,560
Do you...? Are you doing anything?

203
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:35,765
Well, I was going home.

204
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:38,840
Do you want a drink?
I mean, with me.

205
00:16:38,875 --> 00:16:42,377
Do you wanna go for a drink with me?

206
00:16:42,412 --> 00:16:45,880
Simon...I'm your probation worker.

207
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:51,360
I can't.

208
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:56,160
I'm sorry.

209
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:04,480
Simon!

210
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:11,840
Hey. What did you want
to talk to me about?

211
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:16,200
I can't see you any more.

212
00:17:16,235 --> 00:17:18,440
You're finishing with me?

213
00:17:18,475 --> 00:17:21,125
Why?

214
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:22,905
Cos I'm gay.

215
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:25,760
You're gay?

216
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:33,640
So... What, it was all a lie?

217
00:17:33,675 --> 00:17:35,765
Everything?
Wait...

218
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:38,980
How could you do that to me?
What are you doing?

219
00:17:39,015 --> 00:17:42,160
Do I mean nothing to you?
Wait, no, don't cry.

220
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:47,840
Hey. What did you want
to talk to me about?

221
00:17:47,875 --> 00:17:49,405
I can't see you any more.

222
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:51,860
You're finishing with me? Why?

223
00:17:51,895 --> 00:17:54,280
Cos you're fat. You're large.

224
00:17:54,315 --> 00:17:55,765
Kind of round.
What?

225
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:58,880
I've got three months left to live.
I don't want to waste it with you.

226
00:17:58,915 --> 00:18:02,057
Cos I'm impotent
and I know how much you love cock.

227
00:18:02,092 --> 00:18:05,200
Why are you being like this?
Cos you got...weird tits.

228
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:06,800
And nasty snatch gunk.

229
00:18:06,835 --> 00:18:08,645
I'm sorry.

230
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:09,925
You're finishing with me?

231
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:12,165
And you're gonna ask me why
and I can't tell you.

232
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:16,200
There are things going on with me,
things I can't tell you about.

233
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:21,200
No matter what I do, the ones I love
will be the ones who pay.

234
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:26,080
Is that from Spider-Man?

235
00:18:26,115 --> 00:18:28,097
What?
What you just said.

236
00:18:28,132 --> 00:18:30,045
That's from Spider-Man.

237
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:32,680
You're dumping me
with a line from Spider-Man?

238
00:18:32,715 --> 00:18:33,805
No, no.

239
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:35,605
You immature, pathetic, shallow
bastard!

240
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:38,440
- It's not from Spider-Man!
- Have you got no respect for me?

241
00:18:38,475 --> 00:18:40,360
- I thought you were better than that.
- Sam!

242
00:18:41,395 --> 00:18:44,360
You stay away from me!

243
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:59,160
Done.

244
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:03,160
They asked me if I wanted
small or large.

245
00:19:03,195 --> 00:19:05,520
- I said large.
- You trying to get me drunk?

246
00:19:05,555 --> 00:19:07,165
No.

247
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:09,205
I'm joking.

248
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:12,605
Maybe I should get you drunk.
Why?

249
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:16,640
Because I reckon you're quite cute
when you're drunk.

250
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:25,400
Who's that?
I went to school with him.

251
00:19:25,435 --> 00:19:28,325
A friend?

252
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:31,125
He lives next door to me.

253
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:34,520
He stopped speaking to me
when we started secondary school.

254
00:19:34,555 --> 00:19:38,520
Did he give you a hard time?

255
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:43,560
Every morning when I woke up,
I felt sick just thinking about it.

256
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:47,280
I told my parents and the teachers.

257
00:19:47,315 --> 00:19:50,160
They knew it was happening.

258
00:19:50,195 --> 00:19:54,005
No-one did anything.

259
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:58,040
Was it his house
you tried to burn down?

260
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:06,040
A few months ago, he sent me
a text inviting me to this club.

261
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:11,120
I thought he wanted to apologise.

262
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:15,200
I get to the club,
I walk up to him and his mates.

263
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:17,725
He texted me by mistake.

264
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:20,600
It was so humiliating.
Simon...

265
00:20:20,635 --> 00:20:24,600
I was so angry, I...

266
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:27,325
I got drunk.

267
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:31,000
I started thinking about everything
he did to me at school.

268
00:20:31,035 --> 00:20:33,485
I lost it.

269
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:35,605
I went round to his house.

270
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:38,525
I made sure his family were out.

271
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:41,085
I soaked some tissues
in lighter fluid.

272
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:45,120
I lit them and dropped them
through the letterbox.

273
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:49,000
There was a cat.
A cat?

274
00:20:49,035 --> 00:20:50,965
Inside the house.

275
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,760
I thought, "The cat
didn't bully me at school.

276
00:20:54,795 --> 00:20:56,485
"He hasn't done anything."

277
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:58,760
The carpet was just starting
to catch alight.

278
00:20:58,795 --> 00:21:00,440
The cat was freaking out.

279
00:21:00,475 --> 00:21:02,877
What did you do?

280
00:21:02,912 --> 00:21:05,280
I put the fire out.

281
00:21:05,315 --> 00:21:09,280
How?

282
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:14,800
I pissed through the letterbox.

283
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:18,405
This is when his mum comes home.
She starts screaming.

284
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:21,440
You know what it's like once
you've started. It's hard to stop.

285
00:21:21,475 --> 00:21:23,537
It's not funny.

286
00:21:23,572 --> 00:21:25,600
Sorry.

287
00:21:25,635 --> 00:21:28,817
I'm sorry.

288
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:12,240
So are you gonna walk me home?

289
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:17,685
Let's go.

290
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:21,720
Let's give them something
to talk about.

291
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:26,640
All right?

292
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:45,240
This is me.

293
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:49,680
Do you wanna come in?

294
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:13,720
Maybe this isn't such a good idea.

295
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:18,040
- I'm sorry.
- No, it's my fault.

296
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:22,320
See you tomorrow.

297
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:35,480
So did you go with
"nasty snatch gunk", yeah?

298
00:25:36,515 --> 00:25:38,720
- Tried it.
- Seriously?

299
00:25:38,755 --> 00:25:39,717
Yeah.

300
00:25:41,652 --> 00:25:44,980
It's done. It's over.

301
00:25:46,340 --> 00:25:49,420
You know what you said about,
"No matter what you do,

302
00:25:49,455 --> 00:25:51,700
"the ones you love
will be the ones who pay"?

303
00:25:53,540 --> 00:25:55,040
Is that from Spider-Man?

304
00:25:55,075 --> 00:25:56,940
I don't know. I was just trying
to sound intelligent.

305
00:25:56,975 --> 00:25:58,425
Prick.

306
00:25:58,460 --> 00:26:01,340
Why are you complaining?
You got away with it.

307
00:26:01,375 --> 00:26:05,340
Alisha didn't find out.
Job done. Sorted.

308
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:50,340
Do you hear that?

309
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:55,000
- What?
- A baby crying.

310
00:26:56,435 --> 00:26:58,500
What are you talking about?

311
00:27:15,980 --> 00:27:17,700
Do you hear that?

312
00:27:17,735 --> 00:27:19,777
What?

313
00:27:19,812 --> 00:27:22,816
The baby.

314
00:27:37,780 --> 00:27:39,905
Hey there, little man.

315
00:27:39,940 --> 00:27:43,940
Oh! It's all right. I'm here.

316
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:01,320
I think I've just seen Nathan
stealing a baby.

317
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:05,520
He just ran off with it.

318
00:28:05,555 --> 00:28:07,085
Why would he take a baby?

319
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:08,800
If he gets caught, he's screwed.

320
00:28:08,835 --> 00:28:12,800
Call the prick.

321
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:17,160
Switched off.
Fuck's sake.

322
00:28:17,195 --> 00:28:21,160
We need to find him.

323
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:25,680
Come on!

324
00:28:35,835 --> 00:28:37,365
What's he doing?

325
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:56,565
What the fuck are you doing?

326
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:58,845
Hey! There's no need
for language like that.

327
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:02,600
Don't listen to her. That's a very
bad word and she should know better.

328
00:29:02,635 --> 00:29:05,360
You're acting like a freak.
Give us the baby.

329
00:29:05,395 --> 00:29:07,525
You're not taking him! He needs me.

330
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:11,560
I think he's gone mental.
'Be my daddy. Be my daddy.'

331
00:29:11,595 --> 00:29:13,045
Be my daddy. Be my daddy.

332
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:14,920
Be my daddy. Be my daddy.
Be my daddy.

333
00:29:14,955 --> 00:29:17,765
The baby, he's got power.

334
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:20,600
He's making you think
that you're the dad.

335
00:29:20,635 --> 00:29:23,365
He needs a dad.
I know what that's like.

336
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:26,005
My dad was never around.
Look what it did to me.

337
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:30,040
I'm gonna be his daddy.
You? You're gonna be its dad?

338
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:33,680
You're a homeless. You're living
in the community centre.

339
00:29:33,715 --> 00:29:35,045
You got no money, no job.

340
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:38,280
You're poor.
And you've got a criminal record.

341
00:29:38,315 --> 00:29:39,965
You can barely look after yourself.

342
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,420
Social Services
will take one look at you...

343
00:29:42,455 --> 00:29:44,805
Seriously, the kid deserves better.
Way better.

344
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:47,920
Him and his mum can come and live
with me at the community centre.

345
00:29:47,955 --> 00:29:50,485
I can get free food
from the vending machines.

346
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:53,120
I'll steal booze from the kitchen.
I'll steal from other babies.

347
00:29:53,155 --> 00:29:57,120
I'll go to the park
and forage for nuts and berries.

348
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:05,160
You prick.

349
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:08,525
Why am I holding this baby?

350
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:11,440
I'm not being sexist but one of
you girls needs to take this off me

351
00:30:11,475 --> 00:30:15,440
before I drop it on its head.

352
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:19,120
Why have you got my baby?!
Yeah...

353
00:30:19,155 --> 00:30:20,880
Did you take him?
No! No.

354
00:30:20,915 --> 00:30:22,405
You stay away from him!

355
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:25,080
All right? You stay away from him.
He didn't take him.

356
00:30:25,115 --> 00:30:27,240
We found him outside.
We were bringing him back.

357
00:30:27,275 --> 00:30:28,885
He's all right.

358
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:32,920
Why do you keep crawling off? Eh?
He already thinks I'm a shit mum.

359
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:35,445
I don't know what to do.
It's like I'm not enough for him.

360
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:38,860
You should take him to see his dad.
Yeah, well, he's not interested.

361
00:30:38,895 --> 00:30:42,240
Trust me, as soon as he sees him,
he'll want to be his dad again.

362
00:30:42,275 --> 00:30:46,240
I promise ya.

363
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:50,920
Yeah, well,
thanks for bringing him back.

364
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:58,040
Well, look at you, using your
powers, being all superhero.

365
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:25,760
So is it always this tidy
or is it just to impress me?

366
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:29,960
It's always this tidy.

367
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:37,800
Is this all the stuff
you've recorded? Some of it.

368
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:39,565
Most of it's on hard drive.

369
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:43,600
Well, I'd love to watch something.

370
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:52,240
That's really good.
You're very talented.

371
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:59,285
What's this?

372
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:02,040
Do you remember that storm
a few weeks ago?

373
00:32:02,075 --> 00:32:04,725
Yeah, it was just before I started,
wasn't it?

374
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:07,760
Do you have any more footage?
I'd love to see that.

375
00:32:08,795 --> 00:32:10,920
That's it.

376
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:16,760
Do you want a coffee?

377
00:32:17,795 --> 00:32:19,760
Love one.

378
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:44,845
Simon, I've got to go.

379
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:48,400
I've got a friend coming over
and I completely forgot. I'm sorry.

380
00:32:48,435 --> 00:32:51,160
I'll see you tomorrow.

381
00:32:51,195 --> 00:32:55,160
I'm really sorry.

382
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:09,000
What is going on
with this weather?

383
00:33:09,752 --> 00:33:11,000
That's my car.

384
00:33:18,260 --> 00:33:22,260
What have I told you
about filming us on that thing?!

385
00:33:32,660 --> 00:33:35,305
Hi.

386
00:33:35,340 --> 00:33:37,940
There's something
I need to tell you.

387
00:33:37,975 --> 00:33:39,825
Alisha, it's not how it sounds!

388
00:33:39,860 --> 00:33:41,740
How long?
How long have you been with her?

389
00:33:41,775 --> 00:33:43,665
It's complicated.

390
00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:47,340
You're the first person I've been
faithful to and you're cheating on me?

391
00:33:47,375 --> 00:33:51,300
You have no idea what happened to me
last week. You don't know!

392
00:33:51,335 --> 00:33:54,500
All right, there's another version
of history, yeah?

393
00:33:54,535 --> 00:33:55,985
There's a few versions.

394
00:33:56,020 --> 00:33:59,780
In the first one, Sam went to jail
for a drug deal that went bad.

395
00:33:59,815 --> 00:34:02,465
It was my fault. I turned back time.

396
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:06,500
I had the chance to change everything
but I messed up and Sam died.

397
00:34:06,535 --> 00:34:09,705
So I went back again,
to save her, which I did,

398
00:34:09,740 --> 00:34:12,020
but that meant you
and all the others, Simon and Kelly,

399
00:34:12,055 --> 00:34:13,505
you all died.

400
00:34:13,540 --> 00:34:15,225
So I went back again.

401
00:34:15,260 --> 00:34:18,345
I saved Sam and you
and everyone else.

402
00:34:18,380 --> 00:34:22,380
I come back to the present and...
and Sam's still my girlfriend.

403
00:34:24,820 --> 00:34:28,820
- Only you are too.
- Seriously?

404
00:34:29,180 --> 00:34:33,180
Yeah.

405
00:34:36,660 --> 00:34:39,265
Were you with her when
you were getting together with me?

406
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:44,600
Not the first time but everything
changed, so...I guess I must've been.

407
00:34:44,780 --> 00:34:48,540
Wait. Are you cheating on me with her
or are you cheating on her with me?

408
00:34:48,575 --> 00:34:51,377
I have no idea. I didn't mean
to cheat on either of you.

409
00:34:51,412 --> 00:34:54,416
- Don't even know if it is cheating.
- I split up with her.

410
00:34:54,451 --> 00:34:57,385
I couldn't lie to you.
I don't want us to be like that.

411
00:34:57,420 --> 00:35:01,340
Oh, I get it. So you're telling me,
even though you didn't have to.

412
00:35:01,375 --> 00:35:03,145
Yeah.

413
00:35:03,180 --> 00:35:05,705
I can't do these big
relationship moments, all right?

414
00:35:05,740 --> 00:35:09,500
I won't shag anyone either,
and if I do, I'll tell you about it.

415
00:35:09,535 --> 00:35:11,500
Just don't shag anyone else,
full stop.

416
00:35:11,535 --> 00:35:15,500
- Fine!
- Fine.

417
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:22,700
So I guess we're
getting serious, then.

418
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:31,865
- Hi.
- Hi.

419
00:35:31,900 --> 00:35:35,900
Listen, I'm sorry
I had to leave early yesterday.

420
00:35:36,340 --> 00:35:40,340
It's fine.

421
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:45,665
You've...

422
00:35:45,700 --> 00:35:49,700
You've got dirt on your face.

423
00:35:56,700 --> 00:36:00,700
I'll see you later.

424
00:36:06,220 --> 00:36:08,660
No way!
What?

425
00:36:08,695 --> 00:36:11,065
You and her?

426
00:36:11,100 --> 00:36:14,425
What are you talking about?
I'm talking about...

427
00:36:14,460 --> 00:36:18,300
Don't tell anyone. Don't tell Nathan!
I won't tell that prick anything.

428
00:36:18,335 --> 00:36:21,420
Fit older woman.

429
00:36:21,455 --> 00:36:25,185
Heavy.

430
00:36:25,220 --> 00:36:26,400
Curtis?

431
00:36:26,935 --> 00:36:30,900
Thanks.

432
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:36,605
Come on, baby. Come on, now.

433
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:40,520
Oh, yeah. Ooh, yeah.
Ooh, yeah. Ooh, yeah.

434
00:36:40,555 --> 00:36:41,520
Come on, baby!

435
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:54,440
Is that your tea?
Starter, main course, dessert.

436
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:57,000
And a nice refreshing beverage
to wash it down.

437
00:36:57,035 --> 00:36:58,245
You can't live on that shit.

438
00:36:58,280 --> 00:37:01,040
Why don't you come round my house
and I'll cook you dinner?

439
00:37:01,075 --> 00:37:03,805
What are you cooking?
Chicken nuggets.

440
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:06,005
I didn't realise
you were a trained chef.

441
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:09,720
Do you wanna come or not?
Are you asking me round for sex?

442
00:37:09,755 --> 00:37:11,485
Oh, for God's sake.

443
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:15,520
She's cooking me "tea", man.
I think I'm in there. Phwoar!

444
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:33,080
I saw the light was on.

445
00:37:33,115 --> 00:37:35,280
Have the others gone?

446
00:37:35,315 --> 00:37:39,280
Yeah.

447
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:55,480
This, seeing you like this...

448
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:58,820
I could lose my job.

449
00:37:58,855 --> 00:38:01,165
I won't tell anyone.

450
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:05,040
But I'm your probation worker.

451
00:38:05,075 --> 00:38:08,125
It's wrong.

452
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:12,160
Do you want me to go?
No.

453
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:15,820
I'm such an idiot.

454
00:38:15,855 --> 00:38:18,600
You're not an idiot.

455
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,560
Do you want a drink?

456
00:38:20,595 --> 00:38:24,560
Yeah.

457
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:33,960
You get some wine from the kitchen.

458
00:38:33,995 --> 00:38:37,960
I'll lock up.

459
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:48,045
So is it true?

460
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:52,080
What you said about
your dad not being around?

461
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:56,640
What if it is?

462
00:38:56,675 --> 00:39:00,480
Moving on.

463
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:05,360
The thing with me snatching the
baby...

464
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:08,005
You know...

465
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:11,440
What's that? Are you thanking me
for saving your arse?

466
00:39:11,475 --> 00:39:13,440
I guess I am.

467
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:24,640
These chicken nuggets
are cooked to perfection.

468
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:41,165
What?

469
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:45,200
Have you ever had a girlfriend?

470
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:47,605
Who was she?

471
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:49,200
I met her on holiday.

472
00:39:49,235 --> 00:39:52,645
Really?

473
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:56,680
Did you ever...?

474
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:59,560
Did you ever have sex?

475
00:39:59,595 --> 00:40:02,997
We just held hands.

476
00:40:03,032 --> 00:40:06,400
We were only nine.

477
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:16,800
Come here.

478
00:40:16,835 --> 00:40:18,725
Why?

479
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:22,760
Because I want to kiss you.

480
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:48,920
You go get more wine.

481
00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:15,240
'What have I told you
about filming us on that thing?'

482
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:36,845
'Pervert!'

483
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:40,880
'Here, have your little toy.

484
00:41:56,520 --> 00:41:59,780
'It's like that, is it?
So much for being united

485
00:41:59,815 --> 00:42:03,040
'by a horrific, life-changing,
shared experience.'

486
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:17,040
'You know, the situation.
We killed our probation worker!'

487
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:27,845
'It's like that, is it?

488
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:30,600
'So much for being united by a
horrific,

489
00:42:30,635 --> 00:42:34,600
'life-changing, shared experience.'

490
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:39,840
'Last week. You know.

491
00:42:39,875 --> 00:42:41,760
'The situation.'

492
00:42:41,795 --> 00:42:44,445
Oh, Jesus.

493
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:46,840
'We killed our probation worker.'

494
00:42:46,875 --> 00:42:49,200
You shouldn't have taken my phone.

495
00:42:49,235 --> 00:42:52,165
Give me the phone.

496
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:56,200
You killed him.
We had to.

497
00:42:56,600 --> 00:42:58,085
He was crazy.

498
00:42:58,120 --> 00:43:02,120
He was going to kill us.

499
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:04,580
Tony wouldn't hurt anyone.

500
00:43:04,615 --> 00:43:06,987
The storm changed him.

501
00:43:07,022 --> 00:43:09,325
It changed us all.

502
00:43:09,360 --> 00:43:13,360
We have to tell the police.

503
00:43:14,080 --> 00:43:15,800
You were just using me.

504
00:43:15,835 --> 00:43:18,605
No.

505
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:20,725
Simon, no.

506
00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:22,480
This is what you were after.

507
00:43:22,515 --> 00:43:24,257
I had to find out what happened.

508
00:43:24,292 --> 00:43:25,965
This was the only way. I'm sorry.

509
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:29,605
I know it wasn't you.
It was them, wasn't it?

510
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:33,560
You have to give evidence
against them. I'll help you.

511
00:43:33,595 --> 00:43:36,085
Give me my phone!

512
00:43:36,120 --> 00:43:39,725
Why are you protecting them?!

513
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:43,760
You told me how they treat you.
They ignore you.

514
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:47,900
You told me you were lonely.

515
00:43:47,935 --> 00:43:50,760
I never said that to you.

516
00:43:53,960 --> 00:43:57,085
You?

517
00:43:57,120 --> 00:43:59,520
You're Shygirl?

518
00:43:59,555 --> 00:44:01,885
I loved Tony.

519
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:04,080
I just wanted to know what happened.

520
00:44:04,115 --> 00:44:07,377
I didn't want to lie to you.

521
00:44:07,412 --> 00:44:10,640
You're not like them, Simon.

522
00:44:10,675 --> 00:44:14,640
You're not.

523
00:44:15,240 --> 00:44:19,240
But you're the only person
that can help me.

524
00:44:19,880 --> 00:44:23,880
I need you.

525
00:44:26,320 --> 00:44:29,760
Would you do this for me?

526
00:44:29,795 --> 00:44:33,717
Please?

527
00:44:33,752 --> 00:44:37,640
Please?

528
00:44:56,200 --> 00:45:00,200
Shit!

529
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:17,800
Simon?

530
00:45:59,640 --> 00:46:02,720
I can't let you go to the police.

531
00:46:02,755 --> 00:46:05,800
Simon, you don't owe them anything.

532
00:46:07,080 --> 00:46:11,080
They're the only friends I've got.

533
00:47:37,535 --> 00:47:39,445
I'm looking for Sally.

534
00:47:39,480 --> 00:47:41,760
- We can help you, Curtis.
- Nathan!

535
00:47:42,295 --> 00:47:43,685
- Go!
- Kelly!

536
00:47:43,720 --> 00:47:46,480
I've always had a set of balls.
You've just never seen them.

537
00:47:46,515 --> 00:47:49,360
That is about the
gayest thing I've ever heard.

538
00:47:49,395 --> 00:47:51,640
Get on with it, you little freak!

539
00:47:51,675 --> 00:47:53,140
Alisha, stop!

540
00:47:56,040 --> 00:47:58,045
I'm sorry.

541
00:47:58,080 --> 00:47:59,840
I will put a bullet in your skull!

542
00:47:59,875 --> 00:48:01,877
Kelly, don't!
Everybody down.

543
00:48:01,912 --> 00:48:03,845
We fucked up bigger and better

544
00:48:03,880 --> 00:48:06,480
than any generation
that's come before us.

545
00:48:06,515 --> 00:48:10,480
We were so beautiful!
