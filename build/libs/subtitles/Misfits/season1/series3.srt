1
00:00:05,019 --> 00:00:06,979
The storm, it's done something to us.

2
00:00:06,979 --> 00:00:10,459
Something's happened to me, too.
I turned invisible. Look at me!

3
00:00:12,259 --> 00:00:13,819
Time went backwards.

4
00:00:13,819 --> 00:00:15,179
What, you turned back time?

5
00:00:15,179 --> 00:00:17,339
I've got to have sex with you right now.

6
00:00:17,339 --> 00:00:19,259
What is happening to me?

7
00:00:19,259 --> 00:00:21,019
Everyone can do something, except me?

8
00:00:23,819 --> 00:00:26,139
She can't throw me out. She's my mum.

9
00:00:26,139 --> 00:00:28,059
You killed our probation worker!

10
00:00:28,059 --> 00:00:30,299
If there's no body, there's no crime.

11
00:00:30,299 --> 00:00:32,619
I'm pretty sure this
breaches the terms of my ASBO.

12
00:00:32,619 --> 00:00:34,099
Someone knows.

13
00:00:34,099 --> 00:00:36,219
They know we killed
our probation worker.

14
00:01:53,097 --> 00:01:54,697
Someone knows we killed him.

15
00:01:54,697 --> 00:01:56,297
Do you think it could be Sally?

16
00:01:56,297 --> 00:01:57,497
Who's Sally?

17
00:01:57,497 --> 00:01:58,537
The probation worker.

18
00:01:58,537 --> 00:02:00,497
Ooh! Sally! Why d'you know her name?

19
00:02:00,497 --> 00:02:01,857
She told us.

20
00:02:01,857 --> 00:02:04,257
You're a twat, because Sally

21
00:02:04,257 --> 00:02:07,177
didn't show up till the day
after we killed the other worker.

22
00:02:07,177 --> 00:02:08,977
I suppose you know his name, too?

23
00:02:08,977 --> 00:02:10,177
Tony.

24
00:02:11,217 --> 00:02:12,897
Do you love him?

25
00:02:12,897 --> 00:02:15,337
He's right. She wasn't here.

26
00:02:15,337 --> 00:02:19,136
If I'm invisible, I can see if anyone
puts anything else in our lockers.

27
00:02:19,136 --> 00:02:20,616
Sounds like a plan.

28
00:02:23,416 --> 00:02:24,936
You all right with that, yeah?

29
00:02:24,936 --> 00:02:26,736
Works for me.

30
00:02:26,736 --> 00:02:28,816
Go on then.

31
00:02:28,816 --> 00:02:30,256
Turn invisible.

32
00:02:32,376 --> 00:02:34,816
I can't do it when
everyone's watching me.

33
00:02:34,816 --> 00:02:38,696
So I guess it's like pissing at a
urinal if you've got a tiny cock.

34
00:02:42,696 --> 00:02:45,136
Well, that's, er, really impressive.

35
00:02:54,736 --> 00:02:57,936
Hey, you lot! Did you see it?

36
00:03:02,296 --> 00:03:06,216
OK, so, all these clothes have been
donated by members of the public

37
00:03:06,216 --> 00:03:08,855
and we need to sort them before
we ship them out to Africa.

38
00:03:08,855 --> 00:03:10,335
Just another day in paradise.

39
00:03:10,335 --> 00:03:12,295
Yeah, well, I'm sure the people

40
00:03:12,295 --> 00:03:14,615
receiving them will be
grateful for your hard work.

41
00:03:14,615 --> 00:03:16,735
They should be. They're
getting a new wardrobe.

42
00:03:16,735 --> 00:03:17,975
You are so wrong.

43
00:03:17,975 --> 00:03:20,095
These are the categories
to sort them into.

44
00:03:20,095 --> 00:03:22,975
It's children's clothes, shoes,
coats, that kind of thing.

45
00:03:22,975 --> 00:03:25,215
OK, so, if you've got
any questions, just ask.

46
00:03:27,895 --> 00:03:31,615
If a bear and a shark had
a fight, who would win?

47
00:03:35,575 --> 00:03:38,175
If you've got any relevant
questions, just ask.

48
00:03:39,295 --> 00:03:41,215
Oh, and if it's on dry land,

49
00:03:41,215 --> 00:03:42,855
I'd bet on the bear.

50
00:04:11,614 --> 00:04:13,334
Ski wear. Classic.

51
00:04:13,334 --> 00:04:16,934
Try walking ten miles
to the well in these.

52
00:04:16,934 --> 00:04:19,414
Hey, hey, hey. Who am I?

53
00:04:21,014 --> 00:04:24,614
("SINGS" One Love by U2.)

54
00:04:34,094 --> 00:04:36,454
C'mon!

55
00:04:36,454 --> 00:04:38,814
OK.

56
00:04:38,814 --> 00:04:42,054
All right, all right
- I'll give you a clue. I'm an annoying cunt.

57
00:04:42,054 --> 00:04:43,534
Yeah, we know that.

58
00:04:43,534 --> 00:04:45,134
I'm Bono!

59
00:04:48,533 --> 00:04:49,133
Who's that?

60
00:04:49,133 --> 00:04:50,933
It's the girl I had the fight with.

61
00:04:50,933 --> 00:04:53,693
I've got to do some restorative
justice bollocks with her.

62
00:04:54,813 --> 00:04:56,733
Hey, Bono, yeah?

63
00:04:56,733 --> 00:04:57,893
What?

64
00:04:59,173 --> 00:05:00,533
I don't know why I bother.

65
00:05:00,533 --> 00:05:01,613
Jodi's here. Come on.

66
00:05:05,453 --> 00:05:07,573
Suits ya.

67
00:05:29,573 --> 00:05:33,893
So, have you anything
you'd like to say to Kelly?

68
00:05:33,893 --> 00:05:36,053
I've got nothin' to say to her.

69
00:05:36,053 --> 00:05:39,092
Kelly
- would you like to tell Jodi why you hit her?

70
00:05:39,092 --> 00:05:41,932
Yeah. Cos if you go round
saying someone's a slag,

71
00:05:41,932 --> 00:05:43,172
you're gonna get a slap.

72
00:05:43,172 --> 00:05:44,252
KISSES TEETH

73
00:05:44,252 --> 00:05:46,572
Is there something up with your teeth?

74
00:05:46,572 --> 00:05:48,812
OK. How you are you two
going to resolve this?

75
00:05:48,812 --> 00:05:53,052
# Ahhhhhhhhhh! #

76
00:05:55,172 --> 00:05:57,932
Take the roller skates off.

77
00:05:57,932 --> 00:05:59,612
And the goggles.

78
00:05:59,612 --> 00:06:00,772
Take them off!

79
00:06:03,772 --> 00:06:06,972
'Ah, this is bullshit.
We're never gonna be mates.'

80
00:06:06,972 --> 00:06:09,332
I heard you and Darren broke up.

81
00:06:09,332 --> 00:06:10,772
Yeah.

82
00:06:10,772 --> 00:06:12,612
I heard he dumped ya. What's that about?

83
00:06:12,612 --> 00:06:13,852
What is it to you?

84
00:06:13,852 --> 00:06:15,372
Let's keep things friendly.

85
00:06:15,372 --> 00:06:17,292
I think you're better off without
him. He's a rat face glue sniffer.

86
00:06:17,292 --> 00:06:18,292
Kelly.

87
00:06:18,292 --> 00:06:19,132
Are you sayin' he's got a rat face?

88
00:06:19,132 --> 00:06:20,492
Yeah, he's proper ratty.

89
00:06:20,492 --> 00:06:22,492
Don't even be talking about him!

90
00:06:22,492 --> 00:06:24,332
What d'you care? Cos he dumped ya!

91
00:06:24,332 --> 00:06:25,372
Fuckin'...

92
00:06:26,612 --> 00:06:27,771
Kelly!

93
00:06:27,771 --> 00:06:29,171
You see how it feels, bitch!

94
00:06:33,731 --> 00:06:35,251
She's getting life. She head butt me!

95
00:06:35,251 --> 00:06:36,291
Just get out.

96
00:06:36,291 --> 00:06:37,451
You slut whore!

97
00:06:37,451 --> 00:06:38,491
Calm down.

98
00:06:38,491 --> 00:06:40,251
Shut up, you twat!

99
00:06:40,251 --> 00:06:41,491
Kelly!

100
00:06:41,491 --> 00:06:44,171
I was tryin' to be nice!

101
00:06:50,251 --> 00:06:51,891
I think that went pretty well.

102
00:07:06,291 --> 00:07:09,491
How comes you never talk about
what happened when you got arrested?

103
00:07:09,491 --> 00:07:11,091
Nothin' to talk about.

104
00:07:11,091 --> 00:07:14,651
See. That just makes me more curious.

105
00:07:14,651 --> 00:07:16,091
C'mon. Give it up!

106
00:07:18,210 --> 00:07:20,130
I was buying some coke.

107
00:07:21,970 --> 00:07:24,370
Me and this girl I was seeing.

108
00:07:24,370 --> 00:07:25,570
Sam.

109
00:07:26,810 --> 00:07:29,130
The police caught us.

110
00:07:29,130 --> 00:07:30,410
That sucks.

111
00:07:30,410 --> 00:07:33,050
I had one wrap on me.

112
00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:35,770
She had the rest of it.

113
00:07:35,770 --> 00:07:38,290
She was done for intent to supply.

114
00:07:38,290 --> 00:07:39,490
What happened?

115
00:07:40,650 --> 00:07:41,610
She went to prison.

116
00:07:42,890 --> 00:07:44,090
Six months.

117
00:07:44,090 --> 00:07:45,530
Shit.

118
00:07:48,170 --> 00:07:50,050
Are you still with her?

119
00:07:50,050 --> 00:07:53,850
Everything that was happening
- it was too messy.

120
00:07:53,850 --> 00:07:58,010
So, you're not with anyone?

121
00:07:58,010 --> 00:08:00,250
Nah.

122
00:08:03,930 --> 00:08:05,610
What?

123
00:08:07,689 --> 00:08:08,809
What?

124
00:08:08,809 --> 00:08:09,809
You know what.

125
00:08:11,449 --> 00:08:13,009
I know you want to.

126
00:08:14,169 --> 00:08:16,849
All I have to do is touch you.

127
00:08:16,849 --> 00:08:17,849
Don't.

128
00:08:20,569 --> 00:08:22,289
I could have you

129
00:08:23,929 --> 00:08:26,409
any time I want.

130
00:08:26,409 --> 00:08:28,849
Quit doing that, man. Leave it!

131
00:08:28,849 --> 00:08:30,289
Stop being such a dick.

132
00:08:38,929 --> 00:08:40,209
You're so beautiful.

133
00:08:44,369 --> 00:08:45,689
Curtis, wait!

134
00:08:45,689 --> 00:08:47,089
Curtis!

135
00:08:48,849 --> 00:08:49,929
Curtis!

136
00:08:59,528 --> 00:09:02,528
I'm always thinking of you.
I just want to be with you.

137
00:09:02,528 --> 00:09:03,968
I know you do. Come on.

138
00:09:46,887 --> 00:09:50,247
Oh, man! That is wrong.

139
00:09:50,247 --> 00:09:51,767
Don't freak out.

140
00:09:51,767 --> 00:09:53,327
You can't be doing that to people.

141
00:09:53,327 --> 00:09:54,647
Trust me. You enjoyed it.

142
00:09:54,647 --> 00:09:55,687
That wasn't me!

143
00:09:55,687 --> 00:09:58,087
But you were so up for it.

144
00:09:58,087 --> 00:10:00,287
You kept telling me how much
you wanted to be with me.

145
00:10:00,287 --> 00:10:01,847
When I want to tell you something,

146
00:10:01,847 --> 00:10:04,247
I'll tell you myself. You
don't know what I'm feeling.

147
00:10:04,247 --> 00:10:05,807
Yeah, well, I see how you look at me.

148
00:10:05,807 --> 00:10:07,887
Yeah? I won't be
looking at you any more.

149
00:10:07,887 --> 00:10:09,167
Yes, you will.

150
00:10:10,407 --> 00:10:13,567
You think cos you're beautiful, you
can treat people any way you want?

151
00:10:13,567 --> 00:10:15,447
Yeah, that's pretty much how it works.

152
00:10:15,447 --> 00:10:17,207
Haven't you figured that out yet?

153
00:10:17,207 --> 00:10:19,127
You're so messed up.

154
00:10:19,127 --> 00:10:20,847
And you don't even know it.

155
00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:36,340
Are you all right?

156
00:10:36,340 --> 00:10:38,260
Fine.

157
00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:40,580
If you need someone to talk to,

158
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:42,660
I'm a really good listener.

159
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:51,860
Hurray! It's the starlet of justice!

160
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:55,139
I was only saying that the lad that
she used to go out with was a dick.

161
00:10:55,139 --> 00:10:56,739
I was only being nice.

162
00:10:56,739 --> 00:10:58,619
Oh, yeah, you were being lovely.

163
00:10:58,619 --> 00:11:00,619
Right up until you
threw the chair at her.

164
00:11:04,939 --> 00:11:07,659
Don't be doing that shit around me!

165
00:11:07,659 --> 00:11:09,499
You been in all day?

166
00:11:09,499 --> 00:11:11,179
Yeah.

167
00:11:11,179 --> 00:11:14,019
What happened?

168
00:11:14,019 --> 00:11:15,859
Nothing.

169
00:11:15,859 --> 00:11:17,859
No-one came in.

170
00:11:17,859 --> 00:11:20,259
That's an anti-climax!

171
00:11:27,539 --> 00:11:29,139
# My heart

172
00:11:29,139 --> 00:11:33,019
# It melts like plastic... #

173
00:11:35,779 --> 00:11:39,059
Right. Well, I didn't see this coming.

174
00:11:39,059 --> 00:11:40,579
It's just I, er...

175
00:11:40,579 --> 00:11:43,338
I don't usually do this kind of thing.

176
00:11:45,178 --> 00:11:46,818
I mean, I'm not saying you do.

177
00:11:46,818 --> 00:11:48,658
It's just...

178
00:11:48,658 --> 00:11:50,178
I don't remember us having sex.

179
00:11:53,458 --> 00:11:55,738
We had sex, right?

180
00:11:55,738 --> 00:11:58,738
Can you just go?

181
00:11:58,738 --> 00:12:00,778
Yeah.

182
00:13:33,336 --> 00:13:35,016
What the fuck?

183
00:13:35,016 --> 00:13:36,816
Mum! MUM!

184
00:13:56,696 --> 00:13:58,256
Excuse me...

185
00:14:02,776 --> 00:14:03,616
Hey.

186
00:14:03,616 --> 00:14:05,056
Don't talk to me.

187
00:14:15,815 --> 00:14:17,615
Hi!

188
00:14:17,615 --> 00:14:19,095
Hi.

189
00:14:19,095 --> 00:14:21,615
Nice shirt. That
colour really suits you.

190
00:14:21,615 --> 00:14:23,055
Blue.

191
00:14:24,655 --> 00:14:26,095
Are you OK?

192
00:14:59,095 --> 00:15:02,294
(GRUNTS)

193
00:15:04,494 --> 00:15:06,014
We've got a problem.

194
00:15:06,014 --> 00:15:08,214
Will you shut up?! I nearly had it.

195
00:15:08,214 --> 00:15:09,494
What's he doing?

196
00:15:09,494 --> 00:15:12,854
He's trying to smash
the bottle with his mind.

197
00:15:12,854 --> 00:15:16,214
(GRUNTS FORCEFULLY)

198
00:15:18,974 --> 00:15:20,694
I think he's gonna shit himself.

199
00:15:23,094 --> 00:15:25,534
Oh, bullshit!

200
00:15:26,814 --> 00:15:27,854
We've got a problem.

201
00:15:27,854 --> 00:15:30,454
I've got a power, I know it.
I can feel it in my balls.

202
00:15:30,454 --> 00:15:31,694
Listen to me!

203
00:15:31,694 --> 00:15:34,494
It's like a soft vibrating.
You get that, yeah?

204
00:15:34,494 --> 00:15:35,534
No.

205
00:15:35,534 --> 00:15:37,374
They're gonna dig up the bodies!

206
00:15:37,374 --> 00:15:40,934
They're building an environmental
monitoring station under the flyover.

207
00:15:40,934 --> 00:15:43,694
They're building a what?
That sounds made up.

208
00:15:43,694 --> 00:15:45,534
Are we supposed to know what that is?

209
00:15:45,534 --> 00:15:48,294
It's to measure the carbon
monoxide from the flyover.

210
00:15:48,294 --> 00:15:51,173
When they dig the foundations,
they'll find the bodies.

211
00:15:52,413 --> 00:15:54,133
We need to move them.

212
00:15:54,133 --> 00:15:57,653
A couple of questions. "How?"
"Where?" "Are you out of your mind?!"

213
00:15:57,653 --> 00:15:59,173
If we leave them, they'll find them.

214
00:15:59,173 --> 00:16:02,973
Digging them up and wandering around
with them's a low-risk strategy(!)

215
00:16:02,973 --> 00:16:03,973
You got a better idea?

216
00:16:03,973 --> 00:16:05,773
Yeah, I do have a better idea.

217
00:16:05,773 --> 00:16:06,813
Why don't you...

218
00:16:06,813 --> 00:16:10,013
and stop us killing the probation
worker in the first place.

219
00:16:10,013 --> 00:16:12,013
You show me how it
works, and I'll do it.

220
00:16:12,013 --> 00:16:14,813
We need a car.

221
00:16:14,813 --> 00:16:15,933
Have you got a car?

222
00:16:15,933 --> 00:16:18,093
No.

223
00:16:18,093 --> 00:16:20,533
We should call a cab. A seven-seater.

224
00:16:23,813 --> 00:16:24,773
Where've you been?

225
00:16:24,773 --> 00:16:26,413
I had to go doctor's.

226
00:16:26,413 --> 00:16:28,213
While you were getting your smear test,

227
00:16:28,213 --> 00:16:30,333
we heard the bodies
are about to be dug up.

228
00:16:30,333 --> 00:16:33,813
They're building an
environmental monitoring station.

229
00:16:33,813 --> 00:16:35,533
Sounds like bullshit.

230
00:16:35,533 --> 00:16:35,893
Can you steal a car?

231
00:16:35,893 --> 00:16:36,893
Can you get a car?

232
00:16:36,893 --> 00:16:38,733
Will you all fuck off?!

233
00:16:41,252 --> 00:16:44,372
All right, touchy. Look, we're
a bunch of young offenders

234
00:16:44,372 --> 00:16:48,012
and not one of us knows how to
steal a car? That is pathetic.

235
00:16:48,012 --> 00:16:49,852
Look, I'll borrow my dad's car.

236
00:16:49,852 --> 00:16:51,772
You're banned from driving
so that makes sense!

237
00:16:51,772 --> 00:16:54,372
You're a whiny little bitch!

238
00:16:54,372 --> 00:16:56,372
Guys, we need to work together.

239
00:16:56,372 --> 00:17:00,852
Think of it as a team-building
exercise, huh? I'm feeling this.

240
00:17:00,852 --> 00:17:02,412
Are we feeling this?

241
00:17:02,412 --> 00:17:03,852
Prick.

242
00:17:12,652 --> 00:17:14,892
So what do we do with
them when we dig them up?

243
00:17:14,892 --> 00:17:17,292
We weigh them down and
toss them in the lake.

244
00:17:17,292 --> 00:17:19,412
Then you know what happens next week?

245
00:17:19,412 --> 00:17:22,452
The council are like, "Let's
drag the lake!" So predictable.

246
00:17:22,452 --> 00:17:24,452
Yeah, so we bury them somewhere else.

247
00:17:24,452 --> 00:17:27,012
Enough with the digging
and the burying already.

248
00:17:27,012 --> 00:17:29,132
You come up with something then.

249
00:17:29,132 --> 00:17:33,611
We boil them in a bath of
sulphuric acid, serial killer style.

250
00:17:33,611 --> 00:17:37,411
Store them at the Community Centre
till we decide what to do with them.

251
00:17:37,411 --> 00:17:39,571
Oh, great, the Community Centre!

252
00:17:39,571 --> 00:17:42,571
Cos they have a special room
for storing rotting corpses.

253
00:17:42,571 --> 00:17:45,211
There's a disused storeroom
upstairs. I've got a key.

254
00:17:45,211 --> 00:17:46,811
Why have you got a key?

255
00:17:51,331 --> 00:17:55,051
I nicked them because I'm living
in the Community Centre, OK?

256
00:17:55,051 --> 00:17:59,091
Happy? Big secret revealed.

257
00:17:59,091 --> 00:17:59,971
Yeah.

258
00:18:02,771 --> 00:18:04,571
This is a sweet ride.

259
00:18:26,490 --> 00:18:28,210
Oh, man!

260
00:18:29,850 --> 00:18:31,770
It stinks!

261
00:18:31,770 --> 00:18:34,010
We must be getting close.

262
00:18:35,690 --> 00:18:38,930
(RETCHES)

263
00:18:45,010 --> 00:18:46,010
I'm fine.

264
00:18:46,010 --> 00:18:47,650
I'm fine.

265
00:18:52,850 --> 00:18:54,850
(SQUELCH)

266
00:18:54,850 --> 00:18:56,530
I've got something.

267
00:19:01,730 --> 00:19:05,490
Oh! Oh! Oh!

268
00:19:07,410 --> 00:19:09,290
Oops.

269
00:19:09,290 --> 00:19:10,729
Ah, man!

270
00:19:45,089 --> 00:19:46,809
You all right?

271
00:19:46,809 --> 00:19:48,249
What?

272
00:19:48,249 --> 00:19:50,649
You're usually a whole
lot gobbier than this.

273
00:19:50,649 --> 00:19:51,969
No, I'm not.

274
00:19:51,969 --> 00:19:55,729
Come on, you haven't punched me in
a few hours. I'm worried about you.

275
00:19:55,729 --> 00:19:57,769
I'm fine.

276
00:20:02,368 --> 00:20:04,848
How comes you're living in
the Community Centre, anyway?

277
00:20:07,128 --> 00:20:10,168
Do we have to be that intimate
with each other's lives?

278
00:20:10,168 --> 00:20:12,488
No, I don't think so.

279
00:20:12,488 --> 00:20:14,688
Not so big on the sharing.

280
00:20:14,688 --> 00:20:17,688
I'm not getting a shag
now I'm a homeless.

281
00:20:17,688 --> 00:20:19,328
Those Big Issue guys aren't getting any.

282
00:20:19,328 --> 00:20:21,528
Ah, shit! She can hear that!

283
00:20:21,528 --> 00:20:23,888
When are you gonna learn?!

284
00:20:28,528 --> 00:20:30,488
We're set.

285
00:20:30,488 --> 00:20:31,608
Let's go.

286
00:20:31,608 --> 00:20:33,928
Uh, hello?

287
00:20:33,928 --> 00:20:36,368
Don't you think you're
forgetting something?

288
00:20:38,088 --> 00:20:40,008
Argh!

289
00:20:41,488 --> 00:20:42,808
Jesus!

290
00:20:42,808 --> 00:20:44,928
Sorry.

291
00:20:44,928 --> 00:20:46,408
Fuck's sake!

292
00:21:09,247 --> 00:21:10,647
Fuck's sake!

293
00:21:20,167 --> 00:21:21,447
I like your cap.

294
00:21:21,447 --> 00:21:22,687
No!

295
00:21:22,687 --> 00:21:24,247
Oh!

296
00:21:25,327 --> 00:21:26,487
Wha...?

297
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,240
Did you know she was bald?

298
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:38,960
Course not! Twat.

299
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:41,080
Jesus.

300
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:42,760
She looked like an alien.

301
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:44,600
Don't be mean.

302
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:49,240
(LAUGHS) She did,
didn't she? A bald alien.

303
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:50,280
Shh.

304
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:52,760
I should probably try and find her.

305
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:54,120
You know.

306
00:22:02,399 --> 00:22:05,839
Can't you see we're trying to
have an awkward conversation?

307
00:22:07,599 --> 00:22:09,039
Move.

308
00:22:10,719 --> 00:22:13,879
Go!

309
00:22:13,879 --> 00:22:15,759
The sex wasn't that bad, was it?

310
00:22:17,519 --> 00:22:19,839
You don't get it, do you?

311
00:22:22,759 --> 00:22:25,399
There's nothing wrong with me!

312
00:22:25,399 --> 00:22:27,279
You're the one with the problem!

313
00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:43,119
Kelly?

314
00:22:54,718 --> 00:22:56,918
CANS RATTLE

315
00:22:58,838 --> 00:23:00,278
Kelly?

316
00:23:02,198 --> 00:23:03,638
Oh, sorry, mate.

317
00:23:13,158 --> 00:23:14,238
Kelly?

318
00:23:14,238 --> 00:23:15,718
Go away!

319
00:23:15,718 --> 00:23:17,038
Are you all right?

320
00:23:17,038 --> 00:23:19,438
No, I'm not all right,
you prick. I'm bald!

321
00:23:21,038 --> 00:23:24,918
I've got your cap, and your wig.

322
00:23:24,918 --> 00:23:25,918
I don't want you seeing me like this.

323
00:23:25,918 --> 00:23:28,318
All right, I'll close my eyes.

324
00:23:28,318 --> 00:23:30,318
I'll throw them down, OK?

325
00:23:30,318 --> 00:23:33,038
Keep them shut. Don't look!

326
00:23:38,437 --> 00:23:42,117
So I thought that whole moving
the bodies thing went pretty well,

327
00:23:42,117 --> 00:23:43,717
you know, considering.

328
00:23:45,797 --> 00:23:48,277
If you laugh at me, I will
kick the shit out of ya.

329
00:23:48,277 --> 00:23:50,717
I'm not gonna laugh. Who's laughing?

330
00:23:51,837 --> 00:23:53,277
Well, don't.

331
00:23:59,397 --> 00:24:01,637
So what's with the baldness?

332
00:24:03,277 --> 00:24:07,237
This morning, I was in the shower,
and me hair started falling out.

333
00:24:07,237 --> 00:24:08,597
What did the doctor say?

334
00:24:08,597 --> 00:24:11,997
They don't know. They're gonna
have to send me for some tests.

335
00:24:14,237 --> 00:24:15,877
So what are we talking about here?

336
00:24:15,877 --> 00:24:17,477
Are we talking about upstairs and down?

337
00:24:17,477 --> 00:24:18,397
What?!

338
00:24:18,397 --> 00:24:19,437
You know.

339
00:24:19,437 --> 00:24:22,357
Do you have a bald fanny?

340
00:24:22,357 --> 00:24:24,277
For fuck's sake! Ow!

341
00:24:24,277 --> 00:24:28,036
Shit, I'm sorry! I'm serious.

342
00:24:28,036 --> 00:24:29,476
Sorry.

343
00:24:35,036 --> 00:24:36,996
Do you want me to walk you home?

344
00:24:39,756 --> 00:24:41,196
All right.

345
00:25:13,356 --> 00:25:16,635
Jodi! Jodi!

346
00:25:16,635 --> 00:25:18,875
BANGING

347
00:25:18,875 --> 00:25:22,515
Open the door, you bitch!
I know you did it to me!

348
00:25:22,515 --> 00:25:26,515
Open the door! Jodi!

349
00:25:44,395 --> 00:25:48,595
It was her ex-boyfriend,
and he's bald! It's Jodi!

350
00:25:48,595 --> 00:25:50,915
She's got this power or something. Oh!

351
00:25:50,915 --> 00:25:53,315
That bitch did this to me!

352
00:25:53,315 --> 00:25:56,195
She has the power to turn people bald?

353
00:25:56,195 --> 00:25:58,995
That is rubbish. Bald, bald, bald.

354
00:25:58,995 --> 00:26:02,355
When I catch her, I'm going to batter
her. I'm gonna rip her tits off.

355
00:26:04,914 --> 00:26:07,074
We should bury the bodies
under the foundations

356
00:26:07,074 --> 00:26:11,914
of the environmental monitoring station
before they pour in the concrete.

357
00:26:11,914 --> 00:26:16,034
So your plan is, we dig up the
bodies, and then we re-bury them

358
00:26:16,034 --> 00:26:18,674
in exactly the same
place? You're a genius(!)

359
00:26:18,674 --> 00:26:20,474
That works.

360
00:26:20,474 --> 00:26:22,914
Yeah, that's dead smart.

361
00:26:24,514 --> 00:26:25,834
It's OK.

362
00:26:25,834 --> 00:26:29,394
OK, guys, if you want to
grab a box and follow me.

363
00:26:31,074 --> 00:26:32,954
Guys, do you wanna grab a box?

364
00:26:32,954 --> 00:26:37,274
Anyone? Everybody, quick as you can.

365
00:26:37,274 --> 00:26:39,434
Thank you. OK, this way!

366
00:26:51,674 --> 00:26:54,154
Can you get your dad's car again?

367
00:26:57,193 --> 00:26:59,913
So you're talking to me
now you want something.

368
00:26:59,913 --> 00:27:01,753
Let's just get this done, all right?

369
00:27:01,753 --> 00:27:03,633
Ask me nicely and I'll think about it.

370
00:27:03,633 --> 00:27:04,433
I ain't begging you.

371
00:27:04,433 --> 00:27:05,833
You're not all that, you know.

372
00:27:05,833 --> 00:27:07,673
You're not even famous any
more. You should be grateful.

373
00:27:07,673 --> 00:27:09,873
Grateful? I don't want you near me.

374
00:27:09,873 --> 00:27:11,873
Yeah?

375
00:27:12,993 --> 00:27:15,553
What are you up to now?

376
00:27:15,553 --> 00:27:17,793
Er, I was just going home.

377
00:27:17,793 --> 00:27:19,873
Do you want to go out to the park?

378
00:27:22,033 --> 00:27:25,793
Er...yeah, yeah. Sure.

379
00:27:30,753 --> 00:27:31,833
Where's she going?

380
00:27:31,833 --> 00:27:34,113
Urgh. Is she hooking up with him?

381
00:27:34,113 --> 00:27:35,753
Oh, that is definitely on.

382
00:27:35,753 --> 00:27:38,193
How do we move the bodies
without her dad's car?

383
00:27:38,193 --> 00:27:39,793
You need to get that tart on the phone,

384
00:27:39,793 --> 00:27:42,273
and tell her we need her
dad's car to shift the stiffs.

385
00:27:42,273 --> 00:27:44,832
Where you going? We
need to move the bodies.

386
00:27:44,832 --> 00:27:46,632
You deal with it!

387
00:27:49,952 --> 00:27:51,912
We could take Sally's car.

388
00:27:51,912 --> 00:27:53,312
Who's Sally?

391
00:28:07,872 --> 00:28:10,112
What is it? What's happened?

392
00:28:11,712 --> 00:28:13,512
No, just tell me now.

393
00:28:15,512 --> 00:28:18,472
OK. Give me half an hour, OK? Bye.

394
00:28:26,072 --> 00:28:27,872
I'm sorry you're bald.

395
00:28:27,872 --> 00:28:29,912
Thanks.

396
00:28:34,271 --> 00:28:37,191
Do you want to give us a hand?

397

I'm the designated driver.

398

(GROANS) Which one's this?

400
00:28:48,471 --> 00:28:49,871
The probation worker.

401
00:28:49,871 --> 00:28:51,391
He's a fat bastard.

402
00:28:54,951 --> 00:28:56,671
Oh, shit!

403
00:28:58,271 --> 00:29:00,911
Get down, keep down.

404

You're the one with all the
big ideas. What do we do?

405
00:29:17,631 --> 00:29:18,991
Where's the keys?

This all right for you?

409
00:29:52,910 --> 00:29:55,030
It's my last day at the
community centre tomorrow.

410
00:29:56,670 --> 00:29:58,950
We ship all the clothes out to Africa.

411
00:29:59,990 --> 00:30:01,550
I was there last year.

412
00:30:01,550 --> 00:30:05,030
You should see the conditions
these people live in.

413
00:30:05,030 --> 00:30:09,230
No clean water, barely any food.

414
00:30:09,230 --> 00:30:10,630
Makes you think, doesn't it?

415
00:30:12,230 --> 00:30:13,190
What?

416
00:30:15,349 --> 00:30:17,149
Makes you realise how lucky you are.

417
00:30:17,149 --> 00:30:18,909
Oh, shut up.

418
00:30:18,909 --> 00:30:21,349
Where you going?

419
00:30:21,349 --> 00:30:22,749
I want to shag you!

No, please! No, please!

421
00:30:26,109 --> 00:30:27,189
You're so beautiful and slutty.

422
00:30:27,189 --> 00:30:28,309
No, please!

423
00:30:28,309 --> 00:30:33,069
Leave her alone! Get off her!
Oh! I want to have sex with you.

424
00:30:33,069 --> 00:30:34,669
Yeah, me, too.

425
00:30:34,669 --> 00:30:35,309
Me first!

426
00:30:35,309 --> 00:30:36,789
Wait, let me get some...

427
00:30:36,789 --> 00:30:39,229
Get off me! Get off!

Alisha! Alisha!

429
00:30:49,189 --> 00:30:52,469
Someone left the keys in the
ignition, but there's no point

430
00:30:52,469 --> 00:30:55,429
naming names at this stage, it's
done now. So the probation worker

431
00:30:55,429 --> 00:30:59,189
is driving around with the
stiffs in the boot of her car.

432
00:30:59,189 --> 00:31:00,989
Just thought you'd want to know.

433
00:31:00,989 --> 00:31:04,628
Anyway, call me.

434
00:31:05,468 --> 00:31:07,748
I left a message.

435
00:31:07,748 --> 00:31:09,228
Well, I guess that's it.

436
00:31:10,668 --> 00:31:11,828
We're going to prison.

437
00:31:11,828 --> 00:31:13,788
My career teacher said
that's where I'd end up.

438
00:31:13,788 --> 00:31:15,228
She'll be giving it all this.

439
00:31:15,228 --> 00:31:19,748
You'll do all right in prison. You've got
the whole bald thing. You're well butch.

440
00:31:19,748 --> 00:31:22,068
Ow! Ow! You know, you hit me a lot.

441
00:31:22,068 --> 00:31:23,708
Yeah, cos you're a dick.

442
00:31:23,708 --> 00:31:25,948
Maybe Sally won't look in the boot.

443
00:31:25,948 --> 00:31:27,868
Fingers crossed, eh?

444
00:31:40,148 --> 00:31:42,748
Alisha! Wait! Wait!

445
00:31:44,108 --> 00:31:45,588
Stop!

446
00:31:45,588 --> 00:31:48,348
Don't touch me!

447
00:31:48,348 --> 00:31:50,228
All right.

448
00:31:51,508 --> 00:31:56,067
Look, whatever I said, or did,

449
00:31:56,067 --> 00:31:57,987
that wasn't me.

450
00:31:57,987 --> 00:31:59,587
I know.

451
00:31:59,587 --> 00:32:01,107
It's me.

452
00:32:13,787 --> 00:32:16,747
I'm gonna stay over here,

453
00:32:16,747 --> 00:32:18,187

It used to be a good thing, you know...

455
00:32:23,747 --> 00:32:27,427
people wanting to have
sex with you. It was nice.

456
00:32:29,027 --> 00:32:31,107
Now it's shit.

457
00:32:31,107 --> 00:32:34,107
I don't know if someone
actually wants to sleep with me,

458
00:32:34,107 --> 00:32:36,307
or if it's just this bullshit.

459
00:32:36,307 --> 00:32:38,307
Guys still want to have sex with you.

460
00:32:38,307 --> 00:32:39,107
You didn't.

461
00:32:39,107 --> 00:32:40,627
I did.

462
00:32:40,627 --> 00:32:42,946
Just not like that.

463
00:32:45,426 --> 00:32:48,106
You don't need to use your power on me.

464
00:32:49,866 --> 00:32:52,386
I'm already there.

465
00:32:55,426 --> 00:32:57,826
I don't know how to be like this.

466
00:32:57,826 --> 00:33:01,026
We'll work something out.

467
00:33:01,026 --> 00:33:03,306

They were moving the bodies.

What?!

474
00:33:35,185 --> 00:33:37,625
So what's happening?

475

We think Tony's alive.

476
00:33:42,545 --> 00:33:45,065
He used his credit
card to book a flight.

477
00:33:45,065 --> 00:33:48,265
No. It's not him. It can't be.

478
00:33:48,265 --> 00:33:49,865
It was booked in his name.

479

It's one way, to Spain.

480
00:33:53,225 --> 00:33:54,705
He got on the plane?

481
00:33:54,705 --> 00:33:56,545
The flight's not for
another couple of weeks.

482
00:33:56,545 --> 00:33:58,705
Someone must be using his
credit card. It's them!

483
00:33:58,705 --> 00:34:01,705
They were the last people to
see him. They know something.

I know this is hard.

485
00:34:06,065 --> 00:34:07,945
Maybe he left you.

486
00:34:07,945 --> 00:34:10,185
I don't know.

487
00:34:10,185 --> 00:34:11,905
Maybe there's someone else.

488
00:34:13,505 --> 00:34:16,105
He'd never do that to me.

489
00:34:16,105 --> 00:34:17,545

We would have been arrested by
now if she'd found the bodies.

Maybe they're waiting
until we're all together.

About eight o'clock.

We're gonna be OK. We're
not going to prison!

508
00:36:17,902 --> 00:36:21,422
She's going to get out the car walk
to the boot, and find the bodies.

509
00:36:21,422 --> 00:36:22,462
How do you know?

510
00:36:22,462 --> 00:36:24,782
It's already happened once.

511
00:36:24,782 --> 00:36:26,382
So now you rewind time?

512
00:36:31,622 --> 00:36:33,062
Get the bodies!

514
00:36:39,222 --> 00:36:42,822
It's just pure, mindless vandalism.

515
00:36:42,822 --> 00:36:46,662
What is the matter with you?
Are you mentally deficient?

516
00:36:46,662 --> 00:36:49,622
If I was mentally deficient,
I would have missed.

517
00:36:49,622 --> 00:36:52,461
Check that out. Bull's-eye.

me, you fucking bitch?!

521
00:37:46,274 --> 00:37:47,994
What happened to your hair?

522
00:37:47,994 --> 00:37:49,594
I've got alopecia.

523
00:37:51,314 --> 00:37:52,914
It happened when my dad walked out.

524
00:37:52,914 --> 00:37:54,874
I was well stressed.

525
00:37:54,874 --> 00:37:59,994
Oh, this thing itches like a bastard.

526
00:37:59,994 --> 00:38:01,154
You're telling me!

527
00:38:05,994 --> 00:38:07,314
Are you allowed to smoke?

It's not cancer.

529
00:38:12,954 --> 00:38:16,634
Darren broke up with me when
my hair started falling out.

530
00:38:16,634 --> 00:38:19,873
He made me feel like no-one
would want to be with me.

531
00:38:19,873 --> 00:38:21,193
Such a wanker.

532
00:38:21,193 --> 00:38:24,993
Sometimes I just want people to know how
it feels when you feel shit about yourself.

533
00:38:24,993 --> 00:38:27,593
When I feel like that, people go bald.

534
00:38:27,593 --> 00:38:30,433
Please don't tell me this lasts forever.

535
00:38:30,433 --> 00:38:33,393
It only lasts a couple of
days. Your hair just comes back.

536
00:38:33,393 --> 00:38:34,833
What about yours?

537
00:38:36,433 --> 00:38:37,953
Man, I hope so.

538
00:38:39,593 --> 00:38:42,953
I'm sorry I hit you
- you know, the first time.

539
00:38:42,953 --> 00:38:46,033
Yeah, I'm sorry I called you a slag.

540
00:38:46,033 --> 00:38:48,953
I saw Darren.

541
00:38:48,953 --> 00:38:51,993
Every time I see him,
he keeps going bald.

542
00:38:51,993 --> 00:38:53,273
I try to stay away from him.

543
00:38:53,273 --> 00:38:55,233
No way! Bald him up.

544
00:38:57,873 --> 00:39:00,433
Oh, mate, that fucking storm!

545
00:39:04,393 --> 00:39:08,712
Yesterday, in the car, I
don't even know what happened.

546
00:39:08,712 --> 00:39:10,432
Forget it.

547
00:39:10,432 --> 00:39:13,472
What's up with her
anyway? One minute we're...

548
00:39:13,472 --> 00:39:15,112
having sex,

549
00:39:15,112 --> 00:39:17,512
the next she won't even talk to me.

550
00:39:17,512 --> 00:39:21,512
She's nuts. Anyway, see you around.

551
00:39:50,192 --> 00:39:51,712
You're a mess.

552
00:39:51,712 --> 00:39:54,912
Yeah... I know.

553
00:39:58,551 --> 00:40:01,311
I want to be with you.

554
00:40:01,311 --> 00:40:03,311
I want to be with you.

555
00:40:05,271 --> 00:40:08,151
If we're gonna be together,

556
00:40:08,151 --> 00:40:11,791
there's no-one else, yeah?

557
00:40:11,791 --> 00:40:14,031
This is it.

558
00:40:18,111 --> 00:40:20,591
I don't know how to do
this. You can't touch me.

559
00:40:20,591 --> 00:40:22,591
I don't want to.

560
00:40:22,591 --> 00:40:24,111
I do...

561
00:40:26,191 --> 00:40:28,551
I really do.

562
00:40:28,551 --> 00:40:30,631
I really want you to.

563
00:40:30,631 --> 00:40:32,071
But you can't.

564
00:40:32,071 --> 00:40:33,511
I know.

565
00:40:35,391 --> 00:40:37,351
So how do we,

566
00:40:37,351 --> 00:40:40,111
you know?

567
00:40:40,111 --> 00:40:42,431
Cos we need to work something out.

568
00:40:48,950 --> 00:40:52,950
We could try phone
sex, without the phone.

569
00:40:52,950 --> 00:40:54,830
How's that work?

570
00:40:54,830 --> 00:40:56,470
You know.

571
00:40:56,470 --> 00:40:59,270
We stare at each other
and wank ourselves off.

572
00:41:00,990 --> 00:41:02,910
Works for me.

573
00:41:05,710 --> 00:41:08,110
Doesn't matter who's after us now.

574
00:41:08,110 --> 00:41:09,830
They'll never find the bodies.

575
00:41:09,830 --> 00:41:12,390
See ya.

576
00:41:12,390 --> 00:41:14,950
They're gonna think the
probation worker's still alive.

577
00:41:16,550 --> 00:41:18,270
I stole his credit card.

578
00:41:18,270 --> 00:41:20,710
I used it to book a flight.

579
00:41:20,710 --> 00:41:22,350
That is smart!

580
00:41:22,350 --> 00:41:24,470
You're dead good at stuff like that.

581
00:41:24,470 --> 00:41:27,790
Yeah! Nice one, weird kid.

582
00:41:27,790 --> 00:41:29,710
I cannot believe we
got away with this shit.

583
00:41:29,710 --> 00:41:32,670
We should all go out for a drink
- you know, to celebrate.

584
00:41:32,670 --> 00:41:36,310
It's like an ironic "fuck
you" to the probation worker.

585
00:41:36,310 --> 00:41:39,629
We're all out having a good time
- you're buried under the foundations

586
00:41:39,629 --> 00:41:41,669
of an environmental monitoring station.

587
00:41:47,709 --> 00:41:50,149
See you all tomorrow, yeah?

588
00:41:55,109 --> 00:41:56,829
Later.

589
00:42:01,789 --> 00:42:03,229
Yeah...

590
00:42:04,829 --> 00:42:06,429
D'you want to come for a drink?

591
00:42:06,429 --> 00:42:08,509
Are you asking me out on a date?

592
00:42:08,509 --> 00:42:10,189
No. I meant all of us.

593
00:42:10,189 --> 00:42:12,389
Did you?

594
00:42:12,389 --> 00:42:14,389
I am not your whore.

595
00:42:18,069 --> 00:42:22,189
There is no way I'm going
out until my hair grows back.

596
00:42:22,189 --> 00:42:23,669
Sorry.

597
00:42:27,068 --> 00:42:29,228
# I'm naked

598
00:42:29,228 --> 00:42:32,628
# I'm numb I'm stupid

599
00:42:32,628 --> 00:42:34,028
# I'm staying...

600
00:42:34,028 --> 00:42:35,788
(GROANING)

601
00:42:35,788 --> 00:42:39,148
# And if Cupid's got a gun

602
00:42:39,148 --> 00:42:40,588
# Then he's shootin'

603
00:42:43,388 --> 00:42:45,548
# Lights black

604
00:42:45,548 --> 00:42:47,228
# Heads bang

605
00:42:47,228 --> 00:42:50,108
# You're my drug, we live it...

606
00:42:50,108 --> 00:42:53,068
(BREATHES HEAVILY)

607
00:42:53,068 --> 00:42:55,468
# You need it

608
00:42:55,468 --> 00:42:58,548
# Real love, I'll give it

609
00:42:58,548 --> 00:43:01,348
# So we're bound to...

610
00:43:01,348 --> 00:43:06,468
# linger on

611
00:43:06,468 --> 00:43:13,668
# We drink the fatal drop

612
00:43:13,668 --> 00:43:20,667
# Then love until we bleed... #

613
00:43:25,947 --> 00:43:28,027
My life is fucked! And that's on you!

614
00:43:28,027 --> 00:43:32,027
I asked you to buy the gear.
I should've went to prison.

615
00:43:32,027 --> 00:43:33,947
Hey! Police, hey!

616
00:43:36,627 --> 00:43:39,427
If you're not gonna do
anything, then I will.

617
00:43:39,427 --> 00:43:40,507
It's you.

618
00:43:40,507 --> 00:43:41,547
Do I know you?

619
00:43:44,267 --> 00:43:45,747
Ah! Help me!

620
00:43:45,747 --> 00:43:48,347
C'mon, you wankers! Let's have it!

621
00:43:48,347 --> 00:43:50,107
You want me to come with ya?

622
00:43:50,107 --> 00:43:51,547
Give me the fucking money!

623
00:43:51,547 --> 00:43:52,427
I did!

624
00:43:53,827 --> 00:43:55,387
What you smiling about?

625
00:43:55,387 --> 00:43:56,387
I changed the future.

626
00:43:58,867 --> 00:44:01,387
