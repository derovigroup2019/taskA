1
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:07,239
What is that?

2
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:11,799
SCREAMING

3
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:15,599
We should be dead.

4
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:17,439
Something really weird is happening.

5
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:18,799
Have you been sniffing glue?

6
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:21,319
The storm, that lightning
- I dunno, it's done something to us.

7
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:22,719
SCREAMS

8
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:24,639
He's going to kill us.

9
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:28,919
All this. It's already happened
once. Time went backwards.

10
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:30,239
What
- you turned back time?

11
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:32,919
I want to rip your clothes
off and piss on your tits.

12
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:35,919
Oh, what is happening to me?

13
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:37,919
You killed our probation worker.

14
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:40,719
If there's no body... there's no crime.

15
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:42,799
I'm pretty sure this
breaches the terms of my ASBO.

16
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:45,119
What if we're meant
to be like superheroes?

17
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:52,799
In what kind of fucked-up world
would that be allowed to happen?

18
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:55,119
And what? Cos you're
all special, and I'm not?

19
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:57,319
Yeah, well, I doubt it.
You can think what you like

20
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:59,879
but I have a super power and I
just need to find out what it is.

21
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:02,439
Maybe you're just super-retarded.

22
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:04,479
Maybe I've got a whole
Spider-Man vibe going on.

23
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:07,239
You know, maybe I can climb
stuff and do spider shit.

24
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:10,679
Yeah, cos that makes perfect sense.
Why would you be able to climb stuff?

25
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:13,599
I don't know. How is it that you
can turn back time, apparently?

26
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:15,839
And weird kid can turn invisible?

27
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:25,839
It's not like this whole situation
is backed up by a wank-load of logic.

28
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:39,439
What is that?

29
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:26,519
Is he breathing?

30
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:28,199
Hey, nude guy!

31
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:29,879
You're naked!

32
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:32,639
ALL: OH!

33
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:36,919
GROANING

34
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:40,479
You?!

35
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:42,399
Hey!

36
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:47,399
DERISIVE LAUGHTER

37
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:49,719
Do you want to tell us who that was?

38
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:54,079
He's my mum's... He lives with my mum.

39
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:56,559
Your stepdad has got a massive cock.

40
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,279
LAUGHTER

41
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:00,319
Jesus! And he's not
my step-Dad, all right?

42
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:04,199
Did you see that thing? That was
monster big. Your mum will hurt.

43
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:05,639
La, la, la, la
- shut up!

44
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:06,919
Why's he naked?

45
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:10,159
Well, he's obviously some
kind of pervert or he's gay.

46
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,879
Well, he was cruising for rough
trade. They love that shit.

47
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:15,759
Oh, a little light
homophobia. Go for it.

48
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:19,519
Or he could be a rapist.
There's loads of them round here.

49
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:21,199
Maybe he's a werewolf.

50
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,999
Twat.

51
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,879
It's what happens in films.

52
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:28,399
You turn into a werewolf,
you kill someone,

53
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:31,439
then you wake-up somewhere, naked...

54
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:33,079
like a zoo.

55
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:37,239
He's not a werewolf, OK. This guy is such a
pussy, he needs my mum to open jars for him.

56
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:40,919
If was a werewolf he'd be able to open
a jar of peanut butter for himself.

57
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:43,959
What happens if the storm messed him up?

58
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:45,239
That's bollocks. >

59
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:49,399
What are the chances?

60
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:55,759
Help out. Talk to them. Make sure
everyone's having a good time.

61
00:03:55,760 --> 00:04:05,759
Move!

62
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:17,119
Is he dead?

63
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:22,159
I think he's dead.

64
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:25,079
She's stealing your pension!

65
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:31,359
No, he's fine.

66
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:33,799
'My mouth's as dry as a badger's chuff.'

67
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:43,159
D'you want a cup of tea?

68
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:51,799
'Bugger me.'

69
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:54,959
Perhaps you'd like
to dance with someone?

70
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,319
You've got to be shitting me?

71
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:59,319
No, Alisha. I am not "shitting you".

72
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:03,319
Come on...

73
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:07,999
Harry.

74
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,959
Alisha was wondering if
you'd like to dance with her?

75
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:14,879
It would be an honour.

76
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:17,879
(GASPS AND GROANS)

77
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:20,759
Let me taste your sweet cherry lips.

78
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:25,479
I'd give my life to spend a
night between your dusky thighs.

79
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:27,999
OK! Let's find you a chair.

80
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:34,239
You go and help make tea.
Just keep out the way.

81
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,999
OK, Joan. Let's pick up some speed,

82
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,079
let's get that wind
flowing through your hair.

83
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:41,479
Let's get that wind flowing
through your scalp, come on.

84
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:51,479
Hi.

85
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:58,759
Hi.

86
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:00,199
Thanks.

87
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:02,239
So are you like a member
of staff or something?

88
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:04,239
I'm a volunteer.

89
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,759
Volunteer?! I love to volunteer.

90
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:09,479
Is that why they gave
you community service?

91
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:15,039
Could be, could be. I'd probably just
be here anyway you know, helping out.

92
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:17,319
Old people.

93
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:21,279
They're so... they're so...

94
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:27,399
They're old, you know.

95
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:28,399
So what did you do?

96
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:32,559
I sexually assaulted
a 90-year-old woman.

97
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,159
That's funny.

98
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:37,119
She didn't seem to think so at the time.

99
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:39,599
God rest her soul.

100
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,999
Jesus...

101
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:45,279
No, no, the truth is
- I was just done for eating some pick 'n' mix.

102
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:46,919
Right.

103
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:49,079
Of course you were.

104
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:54,239
Such a liar, pass me
those sausage rolls.

105
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:56,439
Yaah!

106
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:59,559
I think she wants to dance with you.

107
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:02,759
Oh, that's nice.

108
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:12,759
(Fuck off.)

109
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:19,279
Someone knows.

110
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:24,719
They know we killed
our probation worker.

111
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:29,239
Is this a wind up? Is this you?

112
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:32,999
If I was trying to wind you up, I
think I'd be a little more creative.

113
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,759
"I know what film you saw last summer."

114
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:39,399
If I wanted to freak you out,
I would've dug up the body and

115
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:40,959
stuck that in your locker.

116
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,879
If it wasn't him, who was it?

117
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:45,039
Well, we've all done stuff.

118
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:46,999
They could be talking about anything.

119
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,439
It was in your locker.

120
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:51,759
This was meant for all of us. They're
talking about the probation worker.

121
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:54,359
OK. Let's say you're right.

122
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:57,639
If they actually knew anything,
they wouldn't be dicking around

123
00:07:57,640 --> 00:08:00,399
sticking notes on lockers. They
would've gone to the police.

124
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:03,399
And we'd all be banged up in prison,
getting gang-raped in the showers.

125
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:08,999
But this, this means that they
have no evidence. No proof. Nothing.

126
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,839
And anyway, I'm guessing it's about
some other totally unrelated shit

127
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:14,999
that you've done.

128
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:19,519
So, if we're all done freaking
out here, over nothing,

129
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:29,519
there's somewhere I need to be.

130
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:34,319
Please tell me you don't
actually believe that prick?

131
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:37,079
Well, whoever did it is just
trying to freak us out, right?

132
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:47,079
So we just act normal.

133
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:59,339
TOOTING

134
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:02,579
Did you get my messages? I need to talk.

135
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:03,979
You're not moving back in.

136
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:07,379
It's not about that. It's
about Jeremy. No. Just listen.

137
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:09,979
This morning, I was doing
my Community Service.

138
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:13,139
We found Jeremy in the
car-park. He was bollock naked.

139
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:14,659
Nathan!

140
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:17,139
I swear.

141
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:18,179
On my life.

142
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:20,379
You're doing it again. You're lying.

143
00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:24,179
Right. How come I know
he's got a massive cock?

144
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:26,899
How would I know that if
I hadn't seen him naked?

145
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:30,299
I don't know! Maybe you
watched him taking a shower?

146
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:33,179
Oh! Cos that sounds like the
sort of thing I'm doing now -

147
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:35,779
watching men showering?

148
00:09:35,780 --> 00:09:39,579
Mum, he was out there, running
around, naked, like a wolf boy.

149
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:41,139
What's a wolf boy?

150
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:43,259
It's a boy, raised by wolves.

151
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:45,579
You know, the little
hairy kid in Siberia.

152
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:47,419
We watched it on Discovery.

153
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:51,059
Why can't you just be happy for me?

154
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:54,579
Because your boyfriend
is some kind of psycho,

155
00:09:54,580 --> 00:10:00,179
rough trade, gay, rapist werewolf!

156
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:01,739
Every man I meet.

157
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:04,259
There's always a reason
you take against them.

158
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:07,979
It's like when you said Richard
was sexually abusing you.

159
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:10,459
It's nothing like that. This is true.

160
00:10:10,460 --> 00:10:13,459
There is something weird
going on with Jeremy.

161
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:23,459
Nathan!This conversation is over!

162
00:11:35,140 --> 00:11:45,139
(Hello?)

163
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:51,499
Argh! What're you doing here?

164
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:53,259
I left my bag.

165
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:56,019
Oh, left your bag, did you?

166
00:11:56,020 --> 00:12:00,179
Of course you did. You sure
you didn't come back to see me?

167
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:03,619
I didn't know you'd be here.

168
00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:04,979
Why are you here?

169
00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:10,979
I'm volunteering. I'm just giving
and giving and then I give some more.

170
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:11,939
Is this a burglary?

171
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:15,659
Is this a burglary? No. I
could say the same to you.

172
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:22,179
Except I've got keys to thebuilding
and permission to be here.

173
00:12:22,180 --> 00:12:32,179
D'you want a drink?

174
00:12:36,260 --> 00:12:46,259
OK.So now it's a burglary.

175
00:12:51,140 --> 00:13:01,139
Whoa!

176
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:50,299
You all right?

177
00:13:50,300 --> 00:14:00,299
I want to get a photo.

178
00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:21,379
(LAUGHS)

179
00:14:33,460 --> 00:14:37,019
A naked man with a
huge cock just ran past.

180
00:14:37,020 --> 00:14:38,179
It's him!

181
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:39,219
Who?

182
00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:40,539
It's my mum's...

183
00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:43,419
It's the guy who lives with my mum.

184
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:45,059
Quick, give me your phone.

185
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:55,059
Give me your phone.

186
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:07,259
SNUFFLING

187
00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:10,699
Did you really think I was going
to let you get away with this?

188
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:16,739
That's my mum, you sick bastard!

189
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:21,459
We can do this, the hard way or the...

190
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:23,499
there is no easy way.

191
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:25,339
Game over.

192
00:15:25,340 --> 00:15:26,899
You're screwed.

193
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:36,139
SNUFFLING

194
00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:40,859
Jezza?

195
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:47,859
Maybe we should talk
about this? Over a coffee?

196
00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:50,339
Argh! Argh! Argh!

197
00:15:50,340 --> 00:15:53,019
Argh! Argh! Argh!

198
00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:56,059
Argh! Argh! Argh!

199
00:15:56,060 --> 00:15:59,459
Argh! Argh! Argh...

200
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:03,459
All right!

201
00:16:03,460 --> 00:16:13,459
DOG BARKS

202
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:26,419
You look like you had a good night.

203
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:31,339
It was all right.

204
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:34,939
Don't thattag mean you've got a curfew?

205
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:41,019
I'm not going to let a thing like
that stop me from enjoying myself.

206
00:16:41,020 --> 00:16:43,259
You should come out with us sometime.

207
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:44,819
I would you know, but >

208
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:51,219
my mum told me to stay
away from girls like you.

209
00:16:51,220 --> 00:17:01,219
Your mum has never met a girl like me.

210
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:08,219
It's him.

211
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:09,979
It's the guy who lives with my mum.

212
00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:11,699
This is evidence.

213
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:15,379
What am I looking at?

214
00:17:15,380 --> 00:17:19,099
Cock, anus, bit of ball-sack.

215
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:20,179
Ooh, what's that?

216
00:17:20,180 --> 00:17:26,059
That's ball-sack. It's
from a low angle. Jesus!

217
00:17:26,060 --> 00:17:27,459
Where were you last night?

218
00:17:27,460 --> 00:17:30,059
'Oh, shit. She knows I'm a homeless.'

219
00:17:30,060 --> 00:17:32,059
Here, look.

220
00:17:32,060 --> 00:17:35,019
Cock, anus, ball-sack...yeah?

221
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:36,059
What's that?

222
00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:37,259
That's cock.

223
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:40,979
Look, this guy is living with my
mum. We've got to do something.

224
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:41,659
Like what?

225
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:42,899
Like what? Can you get me a gun?

226
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:45,019
I ain't getting you a gun.

227
00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:47,579
C'mon. Just a little
one. Nothing too lairy.

228
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:53,739
There's no way I'mgetting
a dickhead like you a gun.

229
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:55,699
You can get a gun off the internet.

230
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:58,059
What if we go round there tonight
- talk to him?

231
00:17:58,060 --> 00:18:02,419
We'll be mature and polite, yeah? And
then we'll just tell him to fuck off.

232
00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:04,979
What if he says no?

233
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:14,419
I don't know. We'll
improvise. So, who's with me?

234
00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:16,019
It's like that, is it?

235
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:20,459
So much for being united by
a horrific, life changing,

236
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:23,939
shared experience.

237
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:25,899
Hmm? Last week?

238
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:31,059
You know? The situation...

239
00:18:31,060 --> 00:18:33,099
We killed our probation worker!

240
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:36,019
Ssshh!

241
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:39,459
That counts for nothing?

242
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:41,339
(Fucking prick.)

243
00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:44,459
I'll come with you.

244
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:48,139
You know, if you want someone
to go with you. I'll come.

245
00:18:48,140 --> 00:18:51,459
I'm not being funny but,
me and you, buddying up...

246
00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:53,819
kicking ass!

247
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:55,899
I'm just not feeling it, but, hey.

248
00:18:55,900 --> 00:19:05,899
Lovely thought. Cheers.

249
00:19:42,020 --> 00:19:52,019
(THEY CHAT)

250
00:19:58,620 --> 00:20:01,579
Did that hurt?

251
00:20:01,580 --> 00:20:02,979
Yeah, hurt like a bastard.

252
00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:05,219
I only got it done cos
my fiance wanted it. >

253
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:06,259
Are you engaged?

254
00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:09,099
I was. I'm not any more.

255
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:10,259
Why, what happened?

256
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:12,419
I could hear what he
was thinking, yeah? >

257
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:18,339
And he wasn't exactly being romantic. >

258
00:20:18,340 --> 00:20:21,299
since you could do your thing?

259
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:25,859
No, not full on.

260
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:28,339
I've tried it out, just for a second.

261
00:20:28,340 --> 00:20:30,619
They were proper horny.

262
00:20:30,620 --> 00:20:32,779
One was quite fit, actually.

263
00:20:32,780 --> 00:20:35,139
Have you shagged anyone?

264
00:20:35,140 --> 00:20:45,139
What d'you think?

265
00:21:04,580 --> 00:21:13,539
CROCKERY SMASHES

266
00:21:13,540 --> 00:21:14,579
Nathan?

267
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:19,259
That's right. Your number's
up, you psycho nudist freak.

268
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:24,499
Oh, I got you now, baby.
See anything you recognise?

269
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:28,739
What am I looking at?

270
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:31,499
Cock, anus, ball-sack.

271
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:32,539
Is it?

272
00:21:32,540 --> 00:21:37,659
It's from a low angle. It's you
- last night.

273
00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:42,459
George Michael gets away with this,
but he was in Wham. Who are you?

274
00:21:42,460 --> 00:21:44,139
I don't remember what happened.

275
00:21:44,140 --> 00:21:46,059
Oh, how very convenient.

276
00:21:46,060 --> 00:21:49,699
This happened. I show this
to my mum, you're history.

277
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:55,019
So just...take your crappy shit.

278
00:21:55,020 --> 00:21:58,979
And go.

279
00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:02,139
That's your mum's.

280
00:22:02,140 --> 00:22:03,379
I'll buy her a new one,

281
00:22:05,180 --> 00:22:08,819
Look, don't make this any
harder on her. Just go!

282
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:12,779
No, you go.Your Mum
doesn't even want you here.

283
00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:15,179
You prick!

284
00:22:15,180 --> 00:22:16,579
Nathan! >

285
00:22:16,580 --> 00:22:18,299
What are you doing!?

286
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:19,379
You made me do this!

287
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:22,419
You wouldn't listen! That
psycho was out last night.

288
00:22:22,420 --> 00:22:25,219
Tell her you sick bastard. Tell her!

289
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:26,899
He already told me.

290
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:30,179
He told you?

291
00:22:30,180 --> 00:22:31,979
So, what the fuck?

292
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:34,499
It started after that storm.

293
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:38,059
It did something to me.

294
00:22:38,060 --> 00:22:41,979
Sometimes it's like I'm a dog.

295
00:22:43,020 --> 00:22:48,419
we had thisJack Russell, Billy.
We did everything together.

296
00:22:48,420 --> 00:22:49,459
That's weird.

297
00:22:49,460 --> 00:22:50,939
He was my best friend.

298
00:22:50,940 --> 00:22:53,539
That's really weird.

299
00:22:53,540 --> 00:22:55,819
Whenever I see a Jack Russell, it...

300
00:22:55,820 --> 00:22:57,619
it brings back all these feelings.

301
00:22:57,620 --> 00:23:00,859
And next thing I know,
I'm waking up, naked.

302
00:23:00,860 --> 00:23:02,619
It's true. >

303
00:23:02,620 --> 00:23:04,699
I didn't believe it at first.

304
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:07,499
But I've seen what he's
like when he changes.

305
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:11,059
Just...are you honestly telling me,

306
00:23:11,060 --> 00:23:12,939
that you're OK with this?

307
00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:14,739
If that's who he is.

308
00:23:14,740 --> 00:23:17,179
I've got to accept it.

309
00:23:17,180 --> 00:23:19,499
Some men dress up in women's clothing...

310
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:22,619
They're just sick
perverts. He's dangerous.

311
00:23:22,620 --> 00:23:25,459
I would never hurt your mum.

312
00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:29,019
I love her.

313
00:23:29,020 --> 00:23:30,299
You've broken his nose!

314
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:40,299
Oh... It's not like you
can enter him in Crufts.

315
00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:00,359
I got your address from
the community centre.

316
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:07,159
I just thought you might
want your phone back.

317
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:11,119
Oh, there's probably a photo
on there you want to delete.

318
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:13,559
It's just a...

319
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:17,959
It's a shot of some ball-sack.

320
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:19,599
Anyway, just,

321
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:23,439
I'll see you around.

322
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:32,039
Are you OK?

323
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:34,919
She's never hit me before...

324
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:38,799
not even a smack when I was a kid.

325
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:41,239
What d'you want from her?

326
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:43,159
Would you be happier
if she was on her own?

327
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:44,239
Yeah.

328
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:46,279
But it's horrible being on your own.

329
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:50,799
You want her to be miserable?

330
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:53,359
You don't want your mum
to have anyone in her life

331
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:55,519
because that means
she's not there for you.

332
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:59,679
Don't try that reverse psychology
A-level bullshit on me. I'm fine.

333
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:01,759
Oh, yeah.

334
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:08,799
You're living in a community
centre. You're doing great.

335
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:13,639
The only thing worse than being lonely,

336
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:17,799
is other people knowing you're lonely.

337
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:24,359
No-one wants to look like a cunt.

338
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:28,879
You can't give your mum
everything she needs.

339
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:31,759
Don't be so selfish.

340
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:34,999
Grow up.

341
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:40,679
What's that supposed to mean?

342
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:41,919
D'you want a drink?

343
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:51,919
Yeah.

344
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:57,799
Whose house is this?

345
00:25:57,800 --> 00:26:00,239
It's my Gran's.

346
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:10,239
I'm staying with her.

347
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:24,239
Is sherry OK?

348
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:32,999
So what happened to you?

349
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:36,279
I came back last night
and you were gone.

350
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:40,159
You seemed more interested
in chasing a naked man

351
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:45,759
around the car park.

352
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:48,319
So what would've
happened if I hadn't gone

353
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:52,199
chasing a naked man around the car park?

354
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:55,399
I'm guessing,

355
00:26:55,400 --> 00:27:01,759
you would have had
some pretty amazing sex.

356
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:03,759
Really?

357
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:10,319
Oh, yeah.

358
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:13,879
# Girl

359
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:21,039
# You'll be a woman soon

360
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:23,239
# I love you so much,
can't count all the ways

361
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:25,959
# I'd die for you, girl,
and all they can say

362
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:27,359
# "He's not your kind"...

363
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:28,559
Your gran's not here, is she?

364
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:29,639
No.

365
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:31,719
# They never get tired
of putting me down

366
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:34,879
# And I never know when I come around

367
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:36,879
# What I'm gonna find

368
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:41,679
# Don't let them make up your mind

369
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:45,319
# Don't you know, girl

370
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:51,079
# You'll be a woman soon

371
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:54,199
# Please

372
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:59,999
# Come take my hand

373
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,279
# Girl

374
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:08,199
# You'll be a woman soon

375
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:11,599
# Soon

376
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:16,239
# You'll be a woman

377
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:18,559
# I've been misunderstood
for all of my life

378
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:22,119
# But what they're saying,
girl, it cuts like a knife

379
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:24,559
# "The boy's no good"

380
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:26,919
# Well, I've finally found
what I've been looking for

381
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:30,199
# But if they get a chance,
they'll end it for sure

382
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:32,719
# They surely would

383
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:36,599
# Baby, I've done all I could

384
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:40,719
# Now it's up to you, girl

385
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:45,959
# You'll be a woman soon

386
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:48,759
# Please

387
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:54,359
# Come take my hand

388
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:57,279
# Girl

389
00:28:57,280 --> 00:29:02,439
# You'll be a woman soon...

390
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:08,959
Well, that's embarrassing.

391
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:12,079
Oh, come on! It's been a while, OK?

392
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:14,399
How about a little sensitivity?

393
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:16,319
It's not that.

394
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:21,359
Do you always pull that
face when you have an orgasm?

395
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:24,159
What is wrong with my cum face?

396
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:31,959
It's really bad.

397
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:36,959
Well, I'll work on it.

398
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:40,439
D'you want to try again?

399
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:41,879
I'm here.

400
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:43,319
You're here.

401
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:53,319
We're both naked, consenting adults...

402
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:10,679
ALARM RINGS

403
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:14,519
(MAN ON INTERCOM) "Hello?
Hello, can I help?"

404
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:20,279
"Is everything OK?
Do you need any help?"

405
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:21,679
I'm coming!

406
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:23,279
(BOTH SCREAM)

407
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:24,719
Oh, fuck!

408
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:29,079
(BOTH SCREAM)

409
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:38,479
(HE SCREAMS)

410
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:42,079
Are you ok?

411
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:45,239
Well, you were... What the fuck...

412
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:47,199
What was that thing?

413
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:50,399
It was the storm.

414
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:53,839
I just wanted to be young again.

415
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:55,559
You complain about my cum face.

416
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:58,999
You should see yours, love.
Trust me. It's a shocker.

417
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:04,239
Do we have to talk about
this through the door?

418
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:06,399
OK.

419
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:08,519
I'm coming out. Move away from the door.

420
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:18,519
Back off, Back off!

421
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:24,039
Exactly how old are you?

422
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:26,919
82.

423
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:29,959
83 next month.

424
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:32,879
I didn't mean for this to happen.

425
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:36,479
It felt so good to be
young again and I liked you.

426
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:38,879
I shagged someone's gran.

427
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:40,479
I haven't got any grandchildren.

428
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:44,119
Oh, that's OK then, cos that
could have been really awkward.

429
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:45,359
I'm sorry.

430
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:47,919
You're sorry? I'm gonna
need counselling now.

431
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:50,479
I'm damaged goods.

432
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:52,519
Where are my boxer shorts?

433
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:54,079
Oh, c'mon. Don't go.

434
00:31:54,080 --> 00:32:03,759
I'm not waiting around for Granny
Fuck Me to make another appearance.

435
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:08,199
Something's wrong. I'm changing back.

436
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:10,479
I think I'm growing old again.

437
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:20,479
I'm scared.

438
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:27,199
This is the fifth time
you've broken your curfew.

439
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:30,039
What's the problem? You can't
go out any time you want.

440
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:31,799
It was my friend's birthday.
What was I supposed to do?

441
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:32,839
It was my friend's birthday. What
was I supposed to do? Is that a joke?

442
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:34,079
D'you see me laughing?

443
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:36,359
I'm arresting you for breaching
the terms of your ASBO.

444
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:39,119
I'm arresting you for breaching the terms
of your ASBO. Oh, you're not serious?

445
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:44,279
Oh, I want you so bad, I need
your lovin', you sexy little minx.

446
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:45,759
Shit! Let go of me!

447
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:47,439
Let's do it on the desk.

448
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:49,199
Get off me!

449
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:53,159
I'm so hard for you. That's five
and a half inches of pure pleasure.

450
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:54,239
Oh, yeah...

451
00:32:54,240 --> 00:33:02,719
Fuck off! Get off me, you pervert!

452
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:11,279
I have no idea why that's out.

453
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:14,679
Are you OK?

454
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:19,079
I'll sort all this out for you.
If you want to make a complaint,

455
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:20,679
I'll back you up.

456
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:25,719
I just want to forget it.

457
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:29,439
You seem to have quite an effect on men.

458
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:31,759
You're a very beautiful girl.

459
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:40,159
It's not my fault if they can't
keep their dicks in their trousers.

460
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:42,679
I am here.

461
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:45,399
You know, if anything like that happens,

462
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:48,079
or if you're worried about anything.

463
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:50,759
You can talk to me. I'll
give you my mobile number.

464
00:33:50,760 --> 00:34:00,759
No, you're all right.

465
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:03,679
# You're beautiful

466
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:09,079
# You're beautiful, it's true

467
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:11,319
# I saw your face

468
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:16,039
# In a crowded place

469
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:22,119
# And I don't know what to do

470
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:32,119
# Cos I'll never be with you

471
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:39,079
# Yes, you caught my heart

472
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:41,839
# As we walked on by

473
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:48,359
# She could see from my
face That I was fucking high

474
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:53,599
# And I don't think
that I'll see her again

475
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:59,639
# But we shared a moment
that will last to the end

476
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:03,719
# You're beautiful

477
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:06,759
# You're beautiful

478
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:11,679
# You're beautiful, it's true

479
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:14,439
# I saw your face

480
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:19,279
# In a crowded place

481
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:24,999
# And I don't know what to do

482
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:31,999
# Cos I'll never be with you... #

483
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,679
Hey what happened to you?

484
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:36,999
I will not be in a room
where that song is playing.

485
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,959
Line in the sand, my friend.

486
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:41,879
Some old woman was looking for you.

487
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:44,759
'What if Ruth's told
someone I had sex with her?

488
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:47,599
'Oh, shit. No, no, no, no, no...'

489
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:50,719
You shagged her!

490
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:57,239
Yeah. Yeah, nice one. I gave
her a right good seeing to.

491
00:35:57,240 --> 00:35:59,079
You totally screwed her.

492
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:01,639
No.

493
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:03,119
No!

494
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:06,039
You nailed that old
woman? Nah, that is wrong.

495
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:07,279
Oh, my God.

496
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:08,439
Did you enjoy it?

497
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:09,919
Shut up, you little freak.

498
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:10,639
I think he enjoyed it.

499
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:11,719
I think he enjoyed
it. Are you into that?

500
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:13,119
No!

501
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:16,559
She didn't look like
that when we started, OK?

502
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:19,679
You remember that bird Ruth,
from Tuesday? Beautiful, yeah?

503
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:23,359
That wrinkly old bint...that's her!

504
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:25,439
It was the storm. It
made her young again.

505
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:31,319
Please, please tell me you didn't...

506
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:34,599
He did!

507
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:42,479
He did! God's sake!

508
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:45,879
Nathan, Nathan wait, look I didn't
mean to tell them. It just came out.

509
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:48,759
Oh, well great job. Nice one.

510
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:52,039
Well done.

511
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:54,439
And stay out of my head, OK?

512
00:36:54,440 --> 00:37:04,439
Granny fucker!

513
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:25,359
# Walk

514
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:29,799
# In silence

515
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:34,279
# Don't walk away

516
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:38,559
# In silence

517
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:41,479
# See the danger

518
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:45,199
# Always danger

519
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:50,199
# Endless talking

520
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:53,999
# Life rebuilding

521
00:37:54,000 --> 00:38:03,999
# Don't walk away

522
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:30,119
# Walk

523
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:32,839
# In silence

524
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:37,919
# Don't turn away... #

525
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:47,919
Hello?

526
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:08,239
Ruth?

527
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:22,759
Ruth.

528
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:32,759
Oh, Jesus, no.

529
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:43,799
# Love you so much
can't count all the ways

530
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:46,799
# I'd die for you, girl,
and all they can say is

531
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:49,839
# "He's not your kind"

532
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:54,039
# They never get tired
of putting me down

533
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:56,479
# And I never know when I come around

534
00:39:56,480 --> 00:40:01,559
# What I'm gonna find

535
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:04,199
# Don't let 'em make up your mind

536
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:10,799
# Don't you know, girl

537
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:17,559
# You'll be a woman soon

538
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:20,919
# Please

539
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:25,959
# Come take my hand... #

540
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:27,839
You little tart.

541
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:31,199
# Girl

542
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:37,919
# You'll be a woman soon

543
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:41,559
# Soon

544
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:47,799
# You'll need a man

545
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:50,239
# I've been misunderstood
for all of my life

546
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:53,479
# But what they're saying,
child, cuts like a knife

547
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:57,879
# "The boy's no good"

548
00:40:57,880 --> 00:41:00,319
# When I finally found
what I been looking for

549
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:04,759
# But if they get the chance
they'll end it for sure... #

550
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:06,479
I'm sorry.

551
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:11,919
# Baby, I've done all I could

552
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:17,279
# It's up to you, girl

553
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:23,759
# You'll be a woman soon

554
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:27,319
# Please

555
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:34,359
# Come take my hand

556
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:38,039
# Girl

557
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:44,719
# You'll be a woman soon

558
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:54,719
# Soon, you'll need a man... #

559
00:41:58,200 --> 00:42:04,359
So I suppose you're going
to tell me you love him?

560
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:10,079
But it doesn't change
how I feel about you.

561
00:42:10,080 --> 00:42:15,119
I'm... I'm so sorry I hit you.

562
00:42:15,120 --> 00:42:17,599
I... I punched the guy you live with.

563
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:22,679
Your, you... I can't
call him your "boyfriend",

564
00:42:22,680 --> 00:42:24,799
or your "partner", it's too pathetic.

565
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:26,519
You can call him Dad, if you like.

566
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:31,399
Oh, that's funny.

567
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:33,319
I've been worried about you.

568
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:36,359
Where're you living?

569
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:37,919
I've got a flat...

570
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:39,439
with some friends...

571
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:42,159
flatmates.

572
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:44,479
If you try to get on with Jeremy,

573
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:49,479
I mean, really try, well,
maybe you could move back in.

574
00:42:49,480 --> 00:42:52,279
I'm not being funny, a woman your age...

575
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:55,679
If you don't settle down before
your looks go, you've got no chance.

576
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:56,759
If you don't settle down before your looks
go, you've got no chance. Oh, thank you.

577
00:42:56,760 --> 00:42:59,199
I can't be looking
after you when you're 80.

578
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:03,559
You'll be phoning me every time
you want to change the TV channel.

579
00:43:03,560 --> 00:43:04,719
No, too painful.

580
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:13,119
I've got my flat. It's
better for all of us.

581
00:43:13,120 --> 00:43:15,359
Come round for your tea sometimes?

582
00:43:15,360 --> 00:43:19,839
Yeah...

583
00:43:19,840 --> 00:43:29,839
See you, then.

584
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:40,719
If you ever hurt her, I'll take you
up the vets and have you put down.

585
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:46,399
I told you there'd be other people

586
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:49,159
who got messed up by the storm.
And you didn't believe me.

587
00:43:49,160 --> 00:43:52,119
Yeah, well, I was wrong, wasn't I?

588
00:43:52,120 --> 00:43:56,359
There's a hurricane of
weird shit out there.

589
00:43:56,360 --> 00:44:02,759
Oh, another oral sex gag. Brilliant.

590
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:05,359
We need to be ready for
when they come after us.

591
00:44:05,360 --> 00:44:06,639
What're you talking about?

592
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:09,359
What're you talking about? The other
people, who got caught up in the storm.

593
00:44:09,360 --> 00:44:11,239
Why would they come after us?

594
00:44:11,240 --> 00:44:14,079
Because that's what people do.

595
00:44:14,080 --> 00:44:24,079
Yeah, well, if they do, we'll just
tell them it was all your fault.

596
00:44:25,600 --> 00:44:29,919
You know that note you
found in your locker?

597
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:39,319
I think it was talking
about the probation worker.

598
00:44:39,320 --> 00:44:49,319
Holy shit.

599
00:45:01,640 --> 00:45:04,359
I've got a power. I know it.
I can feel it in my balls.

600
00:45:04,360 --> 00:45:05,799
I know you want to.

601
00:45:05,800 --> 00:45:09,879
Don't.

602
00:45:09,880 --> 00:45:10,559
You can't be doing that to people.

603
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:16,359
You can't be doing that to
people. Trust me, you enjoyed it.

604
00:45:16,360 --> 00:45:19,279
Tony's alive. He used his
credit card to book a flight.

605
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:21,079
No, it's not him. It can't be.

606
00:45:21,080 --> 00:45:23,239
We're a bunch of young offenders.

607
00:45:23,240 --> 00:45:24,959
Not one of us knows how to steal a car?

608
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:29,519
No, no, no...

609
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:31,239
They're going to dig up the bodies!

610
00:45:31,240 --> 00:45:41,239
We need to move them.

611
00:45:42,040 --> 00:45:52,039
