1
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:51,539
This is it.

2
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:54,739
This is your chance to do something positive.

3
00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:56,779
Give something back.

4
00:00:56,780 --> 00:00:58,339
You can help people,

5
00:00:58,340 --> 00:01:01,579
you can really make a different difference to people's lives.

6
00:01:01,580 --> 00:01:04,979
That's what community service is all about.

7
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:07,139
There are people who think you're scum.

8
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:09,899
You have an opportunity to show them they're wrong.

9
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:12,859
Yeah, but what if they're right?

10
00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:16,779
No offence. But I'm thinking some people are just born criminals.

11
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:17,979
Are you looking to get stabbed?

12
00:01:17,980 --> 00:01:19,539
Are you looking to get stabbed?
You see my point?

13
00:01:19,540 --> 00:01:22,219
It doesn't matter what you've done in the past.

14
00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:24,059
Doing my community service. Hey.

15
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:25,659
Doing my community service. Hey. Boring as fuck.

16
00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:27,139
I'm still talking here.

17
00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:28,099
I thought you'd finished.

18
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:30,339
If my lips are moving, I'm still talking.

19
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:33,459
Yeah, but you could have been yawning, or chewing.

20
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:35,139
End the call. Hang up!

21
00:01:35,140 --> 00:01:36,019
My probation worker...

22
00:01:36,020 --> 00:01:37,659
You all right there, weird kid?

23
00:01:37,660 --> 00:01:40,299
Don't be disgusting. Call you later.

24
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:43,299
I'll rip at your throat and shit down your neck.

25
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:46,939
We need to work as ateam here. Hey, that's enough.

26
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:49,659
Can I move to a different group?

27
00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:51,739
What makes you think you're better than us?

28
00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:52,819
What is that accent?

29
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:53,779
Is that for real?

30
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:55,419
What, are you trying to say something?

31
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:57,459
It's... That's just a noise.

32
00:01:57,460 --> 00:01:59,339
Are we supposed to be able to understand her?

33
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:00,659
Do you understand that?

34
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:02,259
I think she likes me!?

35
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:04,059
Hey, pack it in.

36
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:05,459
It's love, man! What?

37
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:09,459
Do it, man, do it. You're a prick, man, look at you.

38
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:14,179
You're a fuckin' pussy, bruv. He's taking the piss!

39
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:06,019
Oh man, there's paint on my cap. This is bullshit.

40
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:08,819
Ooh!

41
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:18,499
I know you.

42
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:20,059
No, you don't.

43
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:23,459
Yes I do. You're that runner guy.

44
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:25,299
You screwed up big time.

45
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:26,819
You noticed, yeah?

46
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:28,499
Thanks for reminding me.

47
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:32,499
I'm guessing shoplifting? No?

48
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:35,299
Don't act like you know me, cos you don't.

49
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:37,499
I'm just making conversation.

50
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:39,859
This is a chance to network with other young offenders.

51
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:43,739
We should be swapping tips. Brainstorming.

52
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:45,459
Come on, what did you do?

53
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:48,659
A girl called me a slag so I just got into a fight.

54
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:50,459
Was this on the Jeremy Kyle Show?

55
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:51,499
No, it was in Argos.

56
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:53,739
Argos?

57
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:57,739
You should have got one of them little pens andjabbed it in her eye.

58
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:03,019
What about you, weird kid?

59
00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:06,779
Don't take this the wrong way but you look like a panty sniffer.

60
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:09,779
I'm not a panty sniffer.

61
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:13,419
I'm not a pervert.

62
00:04:18,740 --> 00:04:22,739
Itried to burn someone's house down.

63
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:29,579
What did you do?

64
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:33,579
Me? I was done for eating some pick 'n' mix.

65
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:34,939
Bollocks.

66
00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:37,899
What is going on with this weather?

67
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:39,659
How did that happen?

68
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:42,859
I mean, you've been here five minutes.

69
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:45,179
It's painting benches.

70
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:46,939
How did you screw that up?

71
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:50,939
You tell me, because I've got no idea.

72
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:54,139
What the hell was that? Oh, Jesus!

73
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:57,579
What's going on?

74
00:04:57,580 --> 00:05:01,139
That's my car!

75
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:02,179
Classic.

76
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:04,899
Oh, my God!

77
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:06,979
OK, so I'm a little bit freaked out.

78
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:10,979
What is that?

79
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:18,059
Right, everyone inside. Move! Move.

80
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:21,019
Run!

81
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:44,339
Keep going.

82
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:57,099
It's locked. Open it.

83
00:05:57,940 --> 00:05:59,459
Come on!

84
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:02,139
What is happening?

85
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:04,059
Open the door!

86
00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:07,299
I'm finding the right key. Come on! Open the door.

87
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:09,419
Open the fucking door!

88
00:06:09,420 --> 00:06:13,419
Don't speak to me like that!

89
00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:57,579
I feel really weird.

90
00:06:57,580 --> 00:07:00,739
That'll be the lightning.

91
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:02,179
We should be dead.

92
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:05,099
A little reassurance might be nice, you know.

93
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:07,899
"You're fine. Looking good."

94
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:09,779
Wanker!

95
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:13,139
Did he just call me a wanker?

96
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:16,659
Hey, hello?

97
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:18,139
Is everyone all right?

98
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:19,939
We could have died, you dick.

99
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:23,939
Are you all right?
You're acting like a freak.

100
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:31,379
Maybe we should call it a day.

101
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:41,099
'That's right. Scrape it back.'

102
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:43,859
What did you say?

103
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:47,859
I didn't say anything.

104
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:55,539
'She's such a chav.'

105
00:07:55,540 --> 00:07:56,979
What?

106
00:07:56,980 --> 00:08:00,979
What?!

107
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:08,739
Do we just go then?
Where's the probation worker?

108
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:10,979
I think there's something wrong with him.

109
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:12,539
It's like he was having a spasm.

110
00:08:12,540 --> 00:08:16,539
It's like he was having a spasm. He was probably just faking it, to get compensation. Cheap bastard.

111
00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:18,699
I don't think so.

112
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:22,419
And you'd know all about being mental.

113
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:25,619
"Wanker!"

114
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:27,979
Are we waiting for something?

115
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:29,499
Probation worker.

116
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:33,499
I'm not hanging around for that dickhead.

117
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:30,539
Shit.

118
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:33,859
What you did to my phone?!

119
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:37,859
Man, I'm telling you I'm coming out there, I'm gonna mash you up.

120
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:50,739
Good boy. Who's a little baby?

121
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:53,259
You're my little man, are you?

122
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:57,259
Cutie, cutie, my little cutie.

123
00:09:57,460 --> 00:10:01,459
You dirty bitch. I've been licking my bollocks.

124
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:11,659
Who are you fucking winking at?

125
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:15,659
I'm going to shag that poodle next door, she's proper dirty.

126
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:34,499
Mum, it's me. My key won't work.

127
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:38,259
Are you going to let me in?

128
00:10:41,020 --> 00:10:44,499
I need to give my relationship with Jeremy a chance.

129
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:46,739
Jeremy?! Come on.

130
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:49,899
The guy's a total dildo.

131
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:52,699
You are always making fun of people.

132
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:54,899
Nothing anyone says hurts you.

133
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:56,579
Not everybody's like that.

134
00:10:56,580 --> 00:11:00,059
Has Jezza been crying again?

135
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:01,499
Come on, open the door.

136
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:03,139
I've changed the locks.

137
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:04,219
What?

138
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:06,059
You can't be serious.

139
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:08,779
If you stay, he'll leave.

140
00:11:08,780 --> 00:11:11,619
Where am I going to live?
Mum, open the door.

141
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:13,899
Your things by the garage.

142
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:16,419
I've put some money in your rucksack.

143
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:18,179
I'll call you in a few days.

144
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:20,139
Mum?

145
00:11:20,140 --> 00:11:23,019
Mum, don't, come on.

146
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:27,019
Mum! Mum!

147
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:33,179
Mum!

148
00:11:42,980 --> 00:11:46,979
Hey, Adam, how's tricks, how's the herpes?

149
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:50,379
All right, calm down, it's a joke.

150
00:11:50,380 --> 00:11:53,619
Billy. I need a favour, mate. Can I stay and yours?

151
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:55,699
Come on, it'll be a laugh.

152
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:57,579
Liz, you don't mean that.

153
00:11:57,580 --> 00:11:59,619
You, you don't.

154
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:02,379
Well, I don't believe you.

155
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:06,379
Holly. Holly Boyd. The Paul meister!

156
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:12,619
Yep.

157
00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:16,619
No, it's OK, I'll find somewhere else.

158
00:12:16,780 --> 00:12:20,779
No, no, I'm good, I'm good.

159
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:34,099
It's dead weird.

160
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:36,739
It's like I'm off my face or something.

161
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:39,859
Keith was talking to me, and he's a dog, yeah?

162
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:42,659
It's doing my head in.

163
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:45,939
'Get at it.'

164
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:48,379
I'm telling you, I'm losing it.

165
00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:50,059
All right.

166
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:53,419
'Why don't she want to have sex with me?

167
00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:56,859
'Come on, sex her up.

168
00:12:56,860 --> 00:12:58,419
'Oh, yeah!

169
00:12:58,420 --> 00:13:01,539
'What if she thinks I'm shit in bed?

170
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:04,779
'She's been with loads more people than I have.

171
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:08,019
'Maybe she's screwing around.'

172
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:09,699
Argh! What are you doing?

173
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:10,859
I'm not a slag.

174
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:12,859
What? What are you talking about?

175
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:14,259
You think I screw around?

176
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:15,379
Man, you've lost it.

177
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:17,299
That's what you think, you think I'd do that to you?

178
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:21,219
Man, you're a mental case. We're over. I've had enough of you.

179
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:22,379
I fucking love you.

180
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:26,379
'I can't believe I gave her that ring.'

181
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:44,019
Mum? It's me.

182
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:48,019
So, I just want you to know that there's no hard feelings.

183
00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:52,619
I forgive you. You made your point.

184
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:54,459
Point made.

185
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:58,459
So let's stop all this nonsense, OK?

186
00:14:58,780 --> 00:15:00,339
So...

187
00:15:00,340 --> 00:15:04,339
I'll come round, and we'll hug, and you'll cry, and I'll move back in.

188
00:15:05,860 --> 00:15:09,179
Sorted.

189
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:12,139
Everybody's a winner.

190
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:15,659
Anyway, so, call me, yeah?

191
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:17,979
I'll be expecting your call.

192
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:19,499
OK.

193
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:23,459
# Let him stay in bed Till he's fed up

194
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:27,459
# You know he can't go on

195
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:34,099
# His life has felt so long

196
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:40,379
# All ready to go

197
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:44,379
# You know he's so lonely... #

198
00:15:58,820 --> 00:16:00,659
This is a joke. Did one of you do this?

199
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:02,499
Don't look at me, I didn't do it.

200
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:06,219
I'll tell you who did it, it's that Banksy prick.

201
00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:07,899
There's a hidden meaning.

202
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:11,739
It's like that monkey policeman with the banana and the Tesco's bag.

203
00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:13,579
Maybe someone wants to kill us.

204
00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:15,339
Why would anybody want to kill us?

205
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:17,139
Right, come on you lot, let's get changed.

206
00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:19,699
Right, come on you lot, let's get changed. Have you seen this?
Someone's taking the piss.

207
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:22,859
Yeah, it's terrible isn't it?
All this anti-social behaviour.

208
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:24,579
Oh, is he having a dig at us?

209
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:28,419
Right, that's it! All of you, just give me your phones.

210
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:30,699
No one's making any more calls today. Now, come on.

211
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:34,699
No one's making any more calls today. Now, come on. Are you allowed to take our phones?

212
00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:43,339
What?

213
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:47,379
I'm expecting a call from my mum.

214
00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:51,379
OK, take a message.

215
00:16:54,820 --> 00:16:58,819
Wanker.

216
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:08,019
Is he allowed to take our phones?

217
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:10,859
He's probably using them to call one of those sex lines.

218
00:17:10,860 --> 00:17:12,819
Those sex lines will eat your credit.

219
00:17:12,820 --> 00:17:14,859
Call them a lot, do you?

220
00:17:14,860 --> 00:17:17,979
He's out there feeling himself on our phones, naked.

221
00:17:17,980 --> 00:17:19,339
Masturbating.

222
00:17:19,340 --> 00:17:23,339
Isn't this Gary's cap?

223
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:28,139
There's blood on it.

224
00:17:29,620 --> 00:17:33,619
Has anyone seen him?

225
00:17:44,860 --> 00:17:46,379
Did you see that?

226
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:49,939
What was that?

227
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:51,979
I'm talking to you.

228
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:55,979
Something's happening to me.

229
00:17:57,300 --> 00:17:59,859
I'm right here!

230
00:17:59,860 --> 00:18:03,859
Look at me! Look at me!

231
00:18:29,540 --> 00:18:33,539
Can't you see me?

232
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:35,139
Do you want some of this?

233
00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:37,019
Do you want some of this?
No, I'm good.

234
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:38,819
Give it here. Come on.

235
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:42,819
For fuck's sake.

236
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:56,659
Yeah, you just relax, innit?
Take it easy.

237
00:19:56,660 --> 00:20:00,659
Someone's just going to write something else on there tonight.

238
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:03,539
They make us do these bullshit little jobs wearing these

239
00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:05,579
bullshit orange jumpsuits.

240
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:09,219
They can suck my dick.

241
00:20:09,220 --> 00:20:13,219
Nice.

242
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:17,499
Feel free to check out my tits, yeah.

243
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:23,579
'She can't throw me out, she's my mum.

244
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:27,579
'I'm homeless. That is so embarrassing.'

245
00:20:27,580 --> 00:20:31,419
You know after the storm, did any of yous feel like dead weird?

246
00:20:31,420 --> 00:20:35,419
Yeah. I had a strange tingling sensation in my anus.

247
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:40,579
'I should say something.

248
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:44,219
'I'm just so like a freak.'

249
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:45,499
What, did you feel weird?

250
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:47,419
You don't want to hear about my anus?

251
00:20:47,420 --> 00:20:49,459
Do you really need to ask the question?

252
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:51,939
Something happened.

253
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:54,299
What's that? Squeak up.

254
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:55,579
Something happened to me.

255
00:20:55,580 --> 00:20:58,579
Are you a virgin? Hi ho!

256
00:20:58,580 --> 00:21:02,579
Shut up! What was it?

257
00:21:05,980 --> 00:21:09,979
It's nothing.

258
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:12,139
'Would I? I think I would.

259
00:21:12,140 --> 00:21:14,539
'Oh, my God, I'm thinking about shagging a chav.

260
00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:18,539
'Get a grip!'

261
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:23,899
What was that for?

262
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:31,139
Jesus.

263
00:21:31,140 --> 00:21:33,259
Kelly. Where do you think you're going?

264
00:21:33,260 --> 00:21:34,379
Oh, shut up.

265
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:36,539
You can't just walk off whenever you feel like it.

266
00:21:36,540 --> 00:21:38,419
Get your hands off me, you prick.

267
00:21:38,420 --> 00:21:40,299
You just keep pushing, don't you?

268
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:44,299
Push, push, push. I'm sick of dealing with scum like you.

269
00:21:44,780 --> 00:21:46,019
I'll report you!

270
00:21:46,020 --> 00:21:50,019
And who's going to believe you, eh?
You're nothing! Little bitch.

271
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:56,259
Jesus!

272
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:30,819
It's a shame more women don't commit crime. Why is that?

273
00:22:30,820 --> 00:22:32,819
The way I see it, we're a girl short, man.

274
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:33,979
How's that?

275
00:22:33,980 --> 00:22:36,099
There's three of us and only two of them.

276
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:38,299
It looks like one of us is going without.

277
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:41,499
And I'm not being funny, but I'm guessing you drew the short straw.

278
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:43,579
Bad luck.

279
00:22:43,580 --> 00:22:45,579
Therewasfour of us.

280
00:22:45,580 --> 00:22:49,579
I'm talking about getting laid. So how are we going to do this, man?

281
00:22:49,940 --> 00:22:50,979
Do what?

282
00:22:50,980 --> 00:22:54,099
Divide them up. Because the one with all the frizzy hair,

283
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:56,059
I don't see me and her getting it on.

284
00:22:56,060 --> 00:22:58,299
Because she's beautiful?

285
00:22:58,300 --> 00:23:00,579
No, because she'd be way too much effort.

286
00:23:00,580 --> 00:23:02,139
She looks high-maintenance!

287
00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:04,059
You'd have to treat her really well. Pff!

288
00:23:04,060 --> 00:23:06,259
But that other one.

289
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:08,779
Kelly.

290
00:23:08,780 --> 00:23:11,419
Whatever. A couple of Bacardi Breezers, man,

291
00:23:11,420 --> 00:23:13,059
I reckon she'd be good to go.

292
00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:16,419
I might need more than a couple myself, but who's counting.

293
00:23:16,420 --> 00:23:19,859
Yeah, and the girls like, do they have a say in this?

294
00:23:19,860 --> 00:23:22,859
A group of young people doing mindless shit all day.

295
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:25,619
Face it, man, it's going to happen. It's biology.

296
00:23:25,620 --> 00:23:28,259
Or physics. One of those.

297
00:23:28,260 --> 00:23:30,459
So do we have a deal?

298
00:23:33,660 --> 00:23:36,299
No.

299
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:37,779
Fine, maybe I'll take both.

300
00:23:37,780 --> 00:23:39,339
Yeah, I see that happening

301
00:23:39,340 --> 00:23:41,619
Yeah, you will see it and then you'll be sorry

302
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:45,619
you didn't accept the deal. And then who's laughing? Me.

303
00:23:54,540 --> 00:23:55,539
What did he get done for?

304
00:23:55,540 --> 00:23:59,539
What did he get done for?
He said he was done for eating some Pic N' Mix.

305
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:04,739
Prick.

306
00:24:18,060 --> 00:24:21,419
When I was in sixth form, you came to my school.

307
00:24:21,420 --> 00:24:24,059
You gave this big talk about athletics

308
00:24:24,060 --> 00:24:25,979
and all your medals and that.

309
00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:28,219
So, I'm guessing you're not going to the Olympics.

310
00:24:28,220 --> 00:24:32,219
So, I'm guessing you're not going to the Olympics. Funny.

311
00:24:42,140 --> 00:24:43,859
I heard he was dealing crack.

312
00:24:43,860 --> 00:24:46,139
What? I wasn't dealing crack.

313
00:24:46,140 --> 00:24:48,219
No, no, no, the papers said it was steroids.

314
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:50,059
That stuff will shrivel your dick.

315
00:24:50,060 --> 00:24:53,259
It wasn't steroids. I'm not a cheat.

316
00:24:53,260 --> 00:24:55,299
That stuff in the papers was bullshit.

317
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:59,299
So what was it then?

318
00:25:00,460 --> 00:25:03,899
I got caught with a little bit of coke. All right?

319
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:06,459
I messed up one time.

320
00:25:06,460 --> 00:25:08,379
No one gets community service for possession.

321
00:25:08,380 --> 00:25:11,139
No one gets community service for possession. If it was anyone else, they'd have got a caution.

322
00:25:11,140 --> 00:25:13,179
I get 200 hours' community service

323
00:25:13,180 --> 00:25:15,299
and a two-year ban from athletics.

324
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:19,299
They said cos of my profile they needed to send a message.

325
00:25:19,780 --> 00:25:23,499
You let yourself down.

326
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:25,299
You let the kids down.

327
00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:26,499
You let your parents down.

328
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:26,939
You let your parents down. Shut the fuck up!

329
00:25:26,940 --> 00:25:28,339
You let your parents down. Shut the fuck up!
You let the people down.

330
00:25:28,340 --> 00:25:31,419
All I ever did was train. You know nothing!

331
00:25:31,420 --> 00:25:32,539
I shouldn't even fucking be here.

332
00:25:32,540 --> 00:25:36,539
I shouldn't even fucking be here. You can't hit someone in a wheelchair.

333
00:25:38,940 --> 00:25:42,939
Oof.

334
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:49,539
Do want to know what I got done for?

335
00:25:49,540 --> 00:25:53,539
Not really.

336
00:26:01,420 --> 00:26:03,139
Fucking lesbo scum. >

337
00:26:05,780 --> 00:26:09,059
Me and my mate, Chloe, were having cocktails in this bar, yeah.

338
00:26:09,060 --> 00:26:12,019
And she's hassling me, cos she wants to go to this party.

339
00:26:12,020 --> 00:26:16,019
Chloe is on one, because she thinks Jack is doing Lucy.

340
00:26:16,260 --> 00:26:18,139
A total slut fuck.

341
00:26:18,140 --> 00:26:22,139
So we get in my car. I drive us to the party.

342
00:26:22,780 --> 00:26:25,579
We go into one of the rooms, yeah.

343
00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:29,579
Jack's not doing Lucy, he's doing Ellie.

344
00:26:29,580 --> 00:26:33,579
She is a proper slut. Chloe freaks.

345
00:26:34,020 --> 00:26:36,139
I'm driving us back into town.

346
00:26:36,140 --> 00:26:39,219
Chloe's all like, "Oh I feel sick."

347
00:26:39,220 --> 00:26:40,739
I'm like,

348
00:26:40,740 --> 00:26:44,739
"Don't puke in my car, donotpuke in my car."

349
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:46,819
That's when the police pull us over.

350
00:26:46,820 --> 00:26:50,459
I'm already banned from driving, so I am like, "Fuck."

351
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:53,619
This cop, yeah,

352
00:26:53,620 --> 00:26:57,139
he hands me the breathalyser. And I'm like...

353
00:26:57,140 --> 00:27:01,139
"Do I suck, or blow?"

354
00:27:09,980 --> 00:27:13,979
It's insane, I'm totally working it.

355
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:39,939
Now, I don't know if this cop

356
00:27:39,940 --> 00:27:43,939
is gay or what, but he tells me I'm four times over the limit.

357
00:27:45,020 --> 00:27:49,019
It's bullshit. I didn't even want to go to the party.

358
00:27:50,420 --> 00:27:53,499
He's going to kill us. Shit.

359
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:55,579
Nice entrance. Very dramatic.

360
00:27:55,580 --> 00:27:57,979
The probation worker has just attacked me.

361
00:27:57,980 --> 00:27:59,899
Something really weird is happening.

362
00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:01,899
I'm hearing these voices. It's like I can hear what people are thinking.

363
00:28:01,900 --> 00:28:03,739
I'm hearing these voices. It's like I can hear what people are thinking. Have you been sniffing glue?

364
00:28:03,740 --> 00:28:06,539
The storm, the lightning, it's done something to us.

365
00:28:06,540 --> 00:28:09,099
OK. If you can hear our thoughts, what am I thinking?

366
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:11,059
'This is bullshit.'

367
00:28:11,060 --> 00:28:12,739
Do you think it's bullshit?

368
00:28:12,740 --> 00:28:14,379
Of course I think it's bullshit,

369
00:28:14,380 --> 00:28:16,739
you don't need to be a mind reader to know that.

370
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:17,979
Why are you in a wheelchair?

371
00:28:17,980 --> 00:28:19,139
Why are you in a wheelchair?
It was the storm.

372
00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:21,819
The strange tingling sensation in my anus

373
00:28:21,820 --> 00:28:25,219
has spread through my body and now I can't feel my legs.

374
00:28:25,220 --> 00:28:26,419
I'm serious.

375
00:28:26,420 --> 00:28:28,059
Ouch. Jesus.

376
00:28:28,060 --> 00:28:30,179
What do you mean the probation worker attacked you?

377
00:28:30,180 --> 00:28:32,059
What do you mean the probation worker attacked you?
This does sound like complete shit.

378
00:28:32,060 --> 00:28:34,019
He is out there and he chased me.

379
00:28:34,020 --> 00:28:35,939
He is out there and he chased me. Something's happened to me too.

380
00:28:35,940 --> 00:28:38,179
Did you pop your cherry?

381
00:28:38,180 --> 00:28:40,379
Ah, we are all very happy for you.

382
00:28:40,380 --> 00:28:43,379
Earlier on when we were in the locker-room,

383
00:28:43,380 --> 00:28:45,699
I was invisible.

384
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:47,339
I turned invisible.

385
00:28:47,340 --> 00:28:51,339
So, she's psychic and you can turn invisible. That seems likely, yeah.

386
00:28:51,860 --> 00:28:55,099
Did anyone witness this miraculous disappearance?

387
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:56,179
You were all there.

388
00:28:56,180 --> 00:28:59,339
I think we might have noticed you vanishing into thin air.

389
00:28:59,340 --> 00:29:00,739
You didn't.

390
00:29:00,740 --> 00:29:03,899
I was standing right there. You couldn't see me.

391
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:07,899
All right.

392
00:29:09,220 --> 00:29:11,659
Go on, then. Do it.

393
00:29:11,660 --> 00:29:15,659
Turn invisible.

394
00:29:19,620 --> 00:29:23,619
Oh, my God, he's disappeared!

395
00:29:26,820 --> 00:29:27,819
Can't you see me?

396
00:29:27,820 --> 00:29:29,619
Can't you see me?
No.

397
00:29:29,620 --> 00:29:33,219
You're invisible!?
You two are hilarious.

398
00:29:33,220 --> 00:29:36,259
Really, keep taking that medication.

399
00:29:36,260 --> 00:29:38,419
Don't go out there, he will kill you.

400
00:29:38,420 --> 00:29:39,339
Of course he will because he's such a bad ass.

401
00:29:39,340 --> 00:29:40,499
Of course he will because he's such a bad ass. Don't!

402
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:43,819
'I would. I would definitely shag her.'

403
00:29:43,820 --> 00:29:46,939
Come on, this is the biggest load of bullshit I've ever heard.

404
00:29:46,940 --> 00:29:47,619
No!

405
00:29:47,620 --> 00:29:48,659
No!
Ah!

406
00:29:48,660 --> 00:29:52,659
Argh!

407
00:30:31,180 --> 00:30:32,219
Can't you see me? >

408
00:30:32,220 --> 00:30:36,219
No. >

409
00:30:36,820 --> 00:30:38,459
You're invisible?!

410
00:30:38,460 --> 00:30:42,459
You two are hilarious. Really, keep taking that medication.

411
00:30:43,260 --> 00:30:45,579
Don't! Don't go out there, he will kill you.

412
00:30:45,580 --> 00:30:46,379
Of course he will because he's such a bad ass.

413
00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:47,099
Of course he will because he's such a bad ass. Don't!

414
00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:51,099
Of course he will because he's such a bad ass. Don't!
She's telling the truth.

415
00:30:51,260 --> 00:30:54,859
And you know this how?
I suppose you're a psychic now too.

416
00:30:54,860 --> 00:30:58,699
All this. It's already happened once.

417
00:30:58,700 --> 00:31:01,779
I open the door, the probation worker, he killed you.

418
00:31:01,780 --> 00:31:03,459
You were right there.

419
00:31:03,460 --> 00:31:06,339
You were dead. Everything froze.

420
00:31:06,340 --> 00:31:09,379
You were all just standing there. Time went backwards.

421
00:31:09,380 --> 00:31:12,059
What are you saying?
What, you turned back time?

422
00:31:12,060 --> 00:31:13,819
It just gets better by the second.

423
00:31:13,820 --> 00:31:16,299
It just gets better by the second. Everything happened again. Exactly the same.

424
00:31:16,300 --> 00:31:18,779
I'm telling you, don't open that door.

425
00:31:18,780 --> 00:31:21,179
No!

426
00:31:21,180 --> 00:31:22,899
He's right.

427
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:26,899
The probation worker's gone mental.

428
00:31:26,820 --> 00:31:29,619
Maybe he's on crystal meth. That stuff makes you crazy.

429
00:31:29,620 --> 00:31:32,339
My friend Chloe did it, she nearly shagged her brother.

430
00:31:32,340 --> 00:31:35,019
And he's really ugly.

431
00:31:35,020 --> 00:31:38,179
The graffiti. I'm going to kill you. He wrote it.

432
00:31:38,180 --> 00:31:40,779
What did I say - I said there was a hidden meaning.

433
00:31:40,780 --> 00:31:42,779
Or not.

434
00:31:42,780 --> 00:31:45,099
Did anything happen to you?

435
00:31:45,100 --> 00:31:46,379
No. We should call the police.

436
00:31:46,380 --> 00:31:49,699
He took our phones, he's got all our phones.

437
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:53,699
He's stopped.

438
00:31:55,300 --> 00:31:58,019
You dickhead, why did you come back here? You should have gone for help!

439
00:31:58,020 --> 00:31:59,299
What do you know, bitch!

440
00:31:59,300 --> 00:32:00,259
What do you know, bitch!
Shut up, you chav.

441
00:32:00,260 --> 00:32:04,259
If you call me a chav one more time, I'll kick you so hard in the cunt your mum will feel it.

442
00:32:05,220 --> 00:32:06,699
Her mum will feel it - how does that work?

443
00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:08,259
Her mum will feel it - how does that work?
He tried to kill me!

444
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:10,859
I came back here towards you lot and I could have left ya.

445
00:32:10,860 --> 00:32:14,859
I'm sick of every single one of you judging me. You can all fuck off!

446
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:16,259
Whatever. I'm getting out of here.

447
00:32:16,260 --> 00:32:18,059
Whatever. I'm getting out of here. Out the back way, come on.

448
00:32:18,060 --> 00:32:22,059
Fuck's sake!

449
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:25,299
Is that blood?

450
00:32:25,300 --> 00:32:29,299
Fuck!
Jesus Christ!

451
00:32:30,660 --> 00:32:32,419
Get it off me.

452
00:32:32,420 --> 00:32:36,419
Jesus!

453
00:32:57,020 --> 00:33:01,019
I did wonder what had happened to him.

454
00:33:05,180 --> 00:33:06,419
He's going to kill us.

455
00:33:06,420 --> 00:33:08,179
Turn back time, stop this happening.

456
00:33:08,180 --> 00:33:10,419
I don't know how it works.

457
00:33:10,420 --> 00:33:14,419
That's great, that's really useful!

458
00:33:14,980 --> 00:33:16,979
Come on.

459
00:33:16,980 --> 00:33:19,859
Don't look at him.

460
00:33:19,860 --> 00:33:23,539
I've got to have sex with you right now.

461
00:33:23,540 --> 00:33:25,099
You're so beautiful.

462
00:33:25,100 --> 00:33:26,019
What's up with him?

463
00:33:26,020 --> 00:33:27,979
Let's go, let's do it now.

464
00:33:27,980 --> 00:33:29,739
Let's go, let's do it now. Get off me, you freak!

465
00:33:29,740 --> 00:33:32,859
What?

466
00:33:32,860 --> 00:33:36,859
You're so hot! I'm gonna bone you, I'm gonna shag you senseless!

467
00:33:40,780 --> 00:33:42,339
What did I do?

468
00:33:42,340 --> 00:33:43,739
You said you were going to shag her.

469
00:33:43,740 --> 00:33:44,619
You said you were going to shag her. You were getting your chap out.

470
00:33:44,620 --> 00:33:45,979
You said you were going to shag her. You were getting your chap out. Shut up!

471
00:33:45,980 --> 00:33:49,979
It's when you were touching her.

472
00:34:00,340 --> 00:34:01,939
I'm so hard for you.

473
00:34:01,940 --> 00:34:05,339
I want to rip your clothes off and piss on your tits.

474
00:34:05,340 --> 00:34:06,899
What is happening to me?

475
00:34:06,900 --> 00:34:10,899
You sick bastard!

476
00:34:24,740 --> 00:34:28,739
What did you do?

477
00:34:34,020 --> 00:34:36,739
Is he dead?

478
00:34:36,740 --> 00:34:38,619
I'm no doctor but...

479
00:34:38,620 --> 00:34:41,419
you see the way the back of his head's caved in like that...

480
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:48,499
I'm not a chav!

481
00:34:56,580 --> 00:35:00,579
That should do it.

482
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:04,739
You killed our operation worker.

483
00:35:04,740 --> 00:35:07,379
This is very, very bad.

484
00:35:07,380 --> 00:35:09,299
I feel sick.

485
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:10,739
He would have killed us.

486
00:35:10,740 --> 00:35:11,739
We should call the police.

487
00:35:11,740 --> 00:35:15,459
It was self-defence.

488
00:35:15,460 --> 00:35:17,499
Yeah. He's right. We show him the dead boy

489
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:20,379
in the locker, they'll do some CSI shit and figure it out.

490
00:35:20,380 --> 00:35:21,819
They won't believe us.

491
00:35:21,820 --> 00:35:24,459
We just tell them the truth. We stick to our story.

492
00:35:24,460 --> 00:35:26,379
What's our story?
They can turn invisible

493
00:35:26,380 --> 00:35:28,059
and that you can turn back time?

494
00:35:28,060 --> 00:35:31,739
It doesn't matter what we tell them, they'll say we're lying.

495
00:35:31,740 --> 00:35:33,299
They'll say we killed them both.

496
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:37,059
No one's gonna believe you, not any more.

497
00:35:37,060 --> 00:35:41,059
If there's no body, there's no crime.

498
00:35:43,060 --> 00:35:44,499
We should bury them under the flyover.

499
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:46,099
Yeah?

500
00:35:46,100 --> 00:35:48,219
How do we do that?
Someone's gonna see us.

501
00:35:48,220 --> 00:35:52,219
No, we give them a quick little...

502
00:35:52,220 --> 00:35:54,539
Put them in those wheelchairs, wheel them up there,

503
00:35:54,540 --> 00:35:57,619
and if anyone sees us, we're just a bunch of young offenders

504
00:35:57,620 --> 00:36:01,619
taking a couple of specials for a walk in the sunshine.

505
00:36:27,620 --> 00:36:30,379
I'm pretty sure this breaches the terms of my ASBO.

506
00:36:30,380 --> 00:36:33,379
We don't tell anyone about this, yeah?

507
00:36:33,380 --> 00:36:36,379
About the storm or what it did to us or anything.

508
00:36:36,380 --> 00:36:38,579
We are about to bury our probation worker,

509
00:36:38,580 --> 00:36:40,179
we don't need to be drawing any attention to ourselves.

510
00:36:40,180 --> 00:36:42,819
I don't want anyone to know.

511
00:36:42,820 --> 00:36:44,379
I cannot be a freak.

512
00:36:44,380 --> 00:36:48,379
What about you?

513
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:51,899
There's no going back now, man.

514
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:54,019
You were just as screwed as the rest of us.

515
00:36:54,020 --> 00:36:57,099
You are black AND famous. You are probably more screwed.

516
00:36:57,100 --> 00:37:01,099
I shouldn't even be here.

517
00:37:05,540 --> 00:37:08,019
Just then, when he was touching yer...

518
00:37:08,020 --> 00:37:09,299
How were you doing that?

519
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:13,299
I don't know.

520
00:37:18,300 --> 00:37:20,499
Didn't you say you wanted to piss on her tits?

521
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:23,139
Probably best to keep that kind of thing

522
00:37:23,140 --> 00:37:27,139
between you and your internet service provider.

523
00:37:29,660 --> 00:37:33,659
Are you all right?

524
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:42,499
'If she can hear what I'm thinking,

525
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:44,339
'does she know I want to shag her?

526
00:37:44,340 --> 00:37:48,339
'Shit, she can hear that!'

527
00:37:48,340 --> 00:37:52,339
Hold on, all of you have some kind of special power.

528
00:37:53,100 --> 00:37:55,259
Everyone can do something except me.

529
00:37:55,260 --> 00:37:59,019
He can do something, he can do something and I can't.

530
00:37:59,020 --> 00:38:01,059
That's ridiculous, look at him!

531
00:38:01,060 --> 00:38:02,859
How does that make any sense?

532
00:38:02,860 --> 00:38:06,859
Maybe you can do something, you just haven't found out what it is yet.

533
00:38:07,980 --> 00:38:10,339
Yeah, right.

534
00:38:10,340 --> 00:38:13,139
What if I can't feel pain? Ow!

535
00:38:13,140 --> 00:38:14,219
Did you feel that?

536
00:38:14,220 --> 00:38:18,219
Stop hitting me!

537
00:38:29,220 --> 00:38:33,219
# God knows your lonely souls

538
00:38:34,700 --> 00:38:38,699
# God knows your lonely souls

539
00:38:50,460 --> 00:38:54,459
# God knows your lonely souls

540
00:38:59,380 --> 00:39:03,379
# I believe there's a time and a place

541
00:39:05,380 --> 00:39:09,379
# To let your mind drift and get out of this place

542
00:39:10,700 --> 00:39:14,699
# I believe there's a day and a place

543
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:20,019
# That we will go to and I know you want to share

544
00:39:21,260 --> 00:39:25,259
# There's no secret to living

545
00:39:26,260 --> 00:39:30,259
# Just keep on walking

546
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:35,499
# There's no secret to dying

547
00:39:37,300 --> 00:39:41,299
# Just keep on flying

548
00:39:42,100 --> 00:39:46,099
# I'm gonna die in a place that don't know my name

549
00:39:53,020 --> 00:39:56,139
# I'm gonna die in a space

550
00:39:56,140 --> 00:40:00,139
# That don't hold my name... #

551
00:40:23,660 --> 00:40:26,619
If anyone asks what happened yesterday

552
00:40:26,620 --> 00:40:30,619
we say nothing, right?

553
00:40:30,980 --> 00:40:34,979
It's just a completely normal day.

554
00:40:40,340 --> 00:40:42,299
There's nothing here.

555
00:40:42,300 --> 00:40:46,179
No note, nothing, it's like he's just disappeared.

556
00:40:46,180 --> 00:40:48,979
Some of them are here already.

557
00:40:48,980 --> 00:40:50,979
Yeah.

558
00:40:50,980 --> 00:40:54,979
I'll talk to them.

559
00:40:55,420 --> 00:40:59,419
Gary and my colleague, Tony, have both been reported missing.

560
00:41:01,540 --> 00:41:05,539
Their families are very worried about them.

561
00:41:05,740 --> 00:41:09,739
Have you seen anything unusual, anything at all?

562
00:41:16,260 --> 00:41:19,059
You saw something?

563
00:41:19,060 --> 00:41:21,979
A few days ago...

564
00:41:21,980 --> 00:41:25,939
I go into the toilets, Tony and Gary were in there.

565
00:41:25,940 --> 00:41:29,499
They are butt naked, Tony has very by his hair,

566
00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:33,339
like this, and he's just doing him, doggy style.

567
00:41:33,340 --> 00:41:35,259
And Tony is like,

568
00:41:35,260 --> 00:41:39,259
who's your daddy?
I'm your daddy, I'm Big Daddy.

569
00:41:40,660 --> 00:41:44,339
You like that.

570
00:41:44,340 --> 00:41:46,419
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah.

571
00:41:46,420 --> 00:41:50,419
I'm Daddy Cool!

572
00:41:52,140 --> 00:41:56,019
So I'm guessing they've ran away to continue their illicit homosexual affair.

573
00:41:56,020 --> 00:42:00,019
I ask you, in this world of intolerance and prejudice,

574
00:42:00,740 --> 00:42:04,739
who are we to condemn them?

575
00:42:24,940 --> 00:42:28,099
Hi, this is Tony, leave me a message and I'll get back to you

576
00:42:28,100 --> 00:42:29,419
as soon as I can.

577
00:42:29,420 --> 00:42:33,419
Bye.

578
00:42:55,740 --> 00:42:57,379
I think we got away with it.

579
00:42:57,380 --> 00:42:59,739
Do you actually believe that or are you just really dumb?

580
00:42:59,740 --> 00:43:03,739
I actually believe that.

581
00:43:04,220 --> 00:43:07,219
I was there. I should have one of these bullshit powers.

582
00:43:07,220 --> 00:43:09,939
You can have mine. You want to hear what people are thinking about you?

583
00:43:09,940 --> 00:43:13,939
Not so much. I want something good, something from the A-list.

584
00:43:16,540 --> 00:43:18,859
Maybe you can fly.

585
00:43:18,860 --> 00:43:21,899
He's not going to be able to fly.

586
00:43:21,900 --> 00:43:24,939
Yeah, there's always someone that can fly. Check it out.

587
00:43:24,940 --> 00:43:28,939
Don't.

588
00:43:30,140 --> 00:43:34,139
Ow! No, that's not it.

589
00:43:34,580 --> 00:43:38,579
So what happens now? Is this it?
Are we gonna be like this forever?

590
00:43:40,820 --> 00:43:43,979
What if we are meant to be, like, superheroes?

591
00:43:43,980 --> 00:43:47,499
You lot, superheroes?

592
00:43:47,500 --> 00:43:49,859
No offence, but in what kind of fucked-up world

593
00:43:49,860 --> 00:43:51,299
would that be allowed to happen?

594
00:43:51,300 --> 00:43:52,779
I did not sign up for that.

595
00:43:52,780 --> 00:43:55,419
Superheroes!
I love this guy - you prick!

596
00:43:55,420 --> 00:43:58,859
What if there's loads of people like us all over town?

597
00:43:58,860 --> 00:44:02,739
No, that kind of thing only happens in America.

598
00:44:02,740 --> 00:44:06,219
This will fade away. I'm telling you, by this time next week,

599
00:44:06,220 --> 00:44:10,219
it'll be back to the same old boring shit.

600
00:44:16,180 --> 00:44:17,779
You!

601
00:44:17,780 --> 00:44:19,139
You want to tell us who that was?

602
00:44:19,140 --> 00:44:22,539
There is something weird going on with Jeremy.

603
00:44:22,540 --> 00:44:23,779
Can you get me a gun?

604
00:44:23,780 --> 00:44:27,779
There's no way I'm getting a dickhead like you a gun.

605
00:44:31,380 --> 00:44:33,539
My mum told me to stay away from girls like you.

606
00:44:33,540 --> 00:44:36,619
Your mum has never met a girl like me.

607
00:44:36,620 --> 00:44:39,019
Let's do it on the desk.

608
00:44:39,020 --> 00:44:40,259
Get off me!

609
00:44:40,260 --> 00:44:44,259
Let's get that wind flowing through your scalp, come on.

610
00:44:47,660 --> 00:44:51,659
Someone knows. They know we killed our probation worker.
