He's still breathing.

3
00:05:09,233 --> 00:05:12,301
By the looks of him,
he has no idea how close he came.

4
00:05:13,803 --> 00:05:16,437
I'm assuming Saul Goodman
doesn't need to know.

5
00:05:18,274 --> 00:05:19,640

19
00:06:16,619 --> 00:06:17,818
Hang on, baby.

21
00:06:32,428 --> 00:06:34,162
Walt, are you in the house?

<i>Oh, hey, Skyler.</i>

23
00:06:38,667 --> 00:06:39,668
<i>Yeah, it's me.</i>

24
00:06:41,506 --> 00:06:44,076
What-- What the hell
are you doing in there?

25
00:06:44,110 --> 00:06:45,945
<i>I'm back.</i>

26
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:48,281
No. No, you're not back.

27
00:06:48,316 --> 00:06:49,649
Walt, you're not back.

28
00:06:49,683 --> 00:06:51,450
Get-- Get-- Get out of there.

29
00:06:51,484 --> 00:06:54,018
<i>Well, it's-- it's my house,
too, Skyler.</i>

30
00:06:54,053 --> 00:06:55,886
<i>I'm staying. End of story.</i>

31
00:06:57,255 --> 00:06:58,255
We had an agreement.

32
00:06:58,289 --> 00:07:01,257
<i>I didn't agree to anything.</i>

33
00:07:01,291 --> 00:07:02,624
Now, look, just come on inside,

34
00:07:02,658 --> 00:07:04,058
and we'll talk this through, okay?

35
00:07:04,093 --> 00:07:07,260
No. No. There's
nothing to talk about.

36
00:07:07,295 --> 00:07:10,829
I am not coming in there
until you get out.

37
00:07:12,631 --> 00:07:14,398
Well...

38
00:07:14,432 --> 00:07:15,532
suit yourself.

00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:19,768
Walt. Walt?

40
00:07:44,285 --> 00:07:46,952
What is wrong with you?

41
00:07:46,987 --> 00:07:50,089
Skyler, I have every
right to be here.

42
00:07:50,123 --> 00:07:51,457
No, you don't.

43
00:07:51,492 --> 00:07:53,559
You don't live here anymore.

44
00:07:53,594 --> 00:07:54,994
We're getting a divorce.

45
00:07:55,028 --> 00:07:56,629
I don't agree to a divorce.

46
00:07:56,663 --> 00:07:57,930
It's not up to you.

47
00:08:00,133 --> 00:08:02,836
If you don't get out
of here right now,

48
00:08:02,870 --> 00:08:04,507
I'm going to call the police

49
00:08:04,541 --> 00:08:08,078
and I'm going to
tell them everything.

50
00:08:08,113 --> 00:08:10,947
I mean it, Walt.

51
00:08:13,952 --> 00:08:15,452
There's the phone.

52
00:08:34,172 --> 00:08:37,141
<i>It's ringing.</i>

53
00:08:37,175 --> 00:08:39,611
<i>Albuquerque Police Department,</i>

<i>Operator #314B.</i>

<i>How may I help you?</i>

56
00:08:51,358 --> 00:08:54,894
Yes, I-- I want to report
a disturbance, please.

57
00:08:56,863 --> 00:08:59,264
No, no, it's not-
it's not exactly--

58
00:08:59,299 --> 00:09:00,299
It's, um...

59
00:09:02,068 --> 00:09:03,868
It's a domestic issue.

60
00:09:05,404 --> 00:09:06,404
Okay.

61
00:09:10,543 --> 00:09:12,110
They're connecting me.

62
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:16,915
Right hand to God,
I will tell them.

63
00:09:16,949 --> 00:09:19,350
Do what you have to do, Skyler.

64
00:09:20,519 --> 00:09:24,187
This family is everything to me.

65
00:09:24,221 --> 00:09:27,757
Without it, I have nothing to lose.

66
00:09:27,791 --> 00:09:28,791
Fine.

67
00:09:31,828 --> 00:09:34,296
Yes, my name is Skyler White.

68
00:09:34,330 --> 00:09:37,231
I need police assistance
at my home right away.

69
00:09:37,266 --> 00:09:38,532
My--

70
00:09:39,567 --> 00:09:41,668
soon-to-be ex-husband

71
00:09:41,703 --> 00:09:43,270
broke into my house,

72
00:09:43,304 --> 00:09:45,104
and I need an officer

73
00:09:45,139 --> 00:09:46,906
to come and remove him.

74
00:09:48,375 --> 00:09:51,911
It's 308 Negra Arroyo Lane.

75
00:09:53,346 --> 00:09:54,346
Okay.

76
00:09:55,549 --> 00:09:56,549
Okay.

77
00:09:58,386 --> 00:10:00,019
Thank you.

78
00:10:06,593 --> 00:10:07,626
They're coming.

79
00:10:57,452 --> 00:10:58,719
Oh... Dad's here?

80
00:10:58,753 --> 00:11:00,253
Hey. Dad.

81
00:11:00,288 --> 00:11:01,521
Hey, son, come here.

82
00:11:01,555 --> 00:11:04,324
How are you?

83
00:11:04,358 --> 00:11:07,093
Are-- Are you back for good?

84
00:11:07,127 --> 00:11:09,461
Why-- Why are you home so soon?

85
00:11:09,495 --> 00:11:10,896
I-- I'm not.

86
00:11:12,031 --> 00:11:13,298
Ah.

87
00:11:13,332 --> 00:11:15,800
Hey, I am starving.
How about a grilled cheese?

88
00:11:15,834 --> 00:11:17,334
Yeah, sure. You want one, too?

89
00:11:17,368 --> 00:11:20,170
Walter, your dad and I have
something we need to discuss.

90
00:11:20,204 --> 00:11:22,172
When your sandwich is ready,

91
00:11:22,206 --> 00:11:24,407
I'll bring it to your-
to your room.

92
00:11:24,441 --> 00:11:26,675
Mom, can't it wait?

93
00:11:26,709 --> 00:11:29,311
I haven't seen Dad in,
like, forever.

94
00:11:29,345 --> 00:11:30,745
Walter--

95
00:11:37,352 --> 00:11:38,719
Ooh.

96
00:11:41,422 --> 00:11:43,657
Mmm.

97
00:11:43,691 --> 00:11:44,924
Mmm.

98
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:48,961
So are you gonna be
at work tomorrow?

99
00:11:48,995 --> 00:11:51,429
Yeah, that's the plan.

100
00:12:05,776 --> 00:12:07,977
Hello, ma'am. We were
called about a disturbance?

101
00:12:08,011 --> 00:12:11,413
It's more of a trespassing
situation, really, but--

102
00:12:13,349 --> 00:12:15,016
Yeah, that was me.

103
00:12:15,050 --> 00:12:19,620
You called the cops on Dad?

104
00:12:23,091 --> 00:12:25,525
I, uh-- I came home from work,

105
00:12:25,559 --> 00:12:26,759
and he was back.

106
00:12:26,794 --> 00:12:29,295
He just moved back into the house.

107
00:12:29,329 --> 00:12:33,731
And I asked him to leave,
but he won't listen.

108
00:12:33,765 --> 00:12:34,831
I just--

109
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,834
I-- I want him out.

110
00:12:37,868 --> 00:12:39,902
I want him out of the house.

111
00:12:39,937 --> 00:12:42,070
Okay, Mrs. White.
There's a couple of questions

112
00:12:42,105 --> 00:12:43,671
I need to ask you
right off of the bat.

113
00:12:43,706 --> 00:12:45,306
It's very important that
you answer them honestly.

114
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:47,207
Did he strike you?

115
00:12:47,241 --> 00:12:48,574
No.

116
00:12:48,609 --> 00:12:50,176
Has he ever hit you?

117
00:12:50,210 --> 00:12:52,944
No. This is not about violence.

118
00:12:52,978 --> 00:12:55,045
This is about trespassing,

119
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:58,848
about him being here
against my will.

120
00:12:58,882 --> 00:13:00,082
Okay. Trespassing.

121
00:13:00,116 --> 00:13:01,716
You're divorced, then?

122
00:13:01,751 --> 00:13:03,951
No, working on it.

123
00:13:03,985 --> 00:13:05,719
Right now we're separated.

124
00:13:05,753 --> 00:13:08,187
Legally separated?

125
00:13:08,221 --> 00:13:09,487
Well, there's not a court order,

126
00:13:09,522 --> 00:13:10,722
if that's what you mean,

127
00:13:10,756 --> 00:13:12,056
but we've been living apart

128
00:13:12,090 --> 00:13:14,324
for almost two weeks,
give or take--

129
00:13:14,359 --> 00:13:16,026
I changed the locks.

130
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:18,761
Isn't that breaking and entering?

131
00:13:18,795 --> 00:13:20,863
Whose name is on the
title to the house?

132
00:13:20,897 --> 00:13:23,365
Both of us. It's jointly owned.

133
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:24,500
We can't arrest a man

134
00:13:24,534 --> 00:13:26,234
for breaking into his own house,

135
00:13:26,269 --> 00:13:27,435
not without a court order

136
00:13:27,470 --> 00:13:29,037
requiring he stays
away from the premises,

137
00:13:29,071 --> 00:13:31,438
unless he's threatened you
or the kids in any way.

138
00:13:31,473 --> 00:13:33,607
No, not--

139
00:13:33,641 --> 00:13:35,075
not physically, but having him

140
00:13:35,109 --> 00:13:36,476
in the house is just--

141
00:13:37,778 --> 00:13:40,213
It's not a good thing.

142
00:13:40,247 --> 00:13:43,749
Excuse me. Don't cry. Daddy's here.

143
00:13:43,783 --> 00:13:45,284
I got her, honey.

144
00:13:45,318 --> 00:13:47,018
Oh, come here.

145
00:13:47,053 --> 00:13:49,020
There we go.

146
00:13:49,054 --> 00:13:50,854
You hungry?

147
00:13:50,888 --> 00:13:52,788
You hungry?

148
00:13:52,823 --> 00:13:53,789
Here we go.

149
00:13:53,823 --> 00:13:56,390
Oh, that was it.

150
00:13:56,424 --> 00:13:59,659
I'm sorry, Officer. Where were we?

151
00:13:59,693 --> 00:14:01,060
Disagreements.

152
00:14:01,094 --> 00:14:04,862
Yeah, so we've had
our share of that.

153
00:14:04,897 --> 00:14:07,965
Um, I-- I haven't...

154
00:14:07,999 --> 00:14:10,433
I haven't been the most
attentive husband lately.

155
00:14:12,902 --> 00:14:16,570
Mrs. White, would this be easier
if we stepped outside for a minute?

156
00:14:20,207 --> 00:14:21,407
No.

157
00:14:22,676 --> 00:14:23,676
No.

158
00:14:25,112 --> 00:14:27,079
I'm fine right here.

159
00:14:27,114 --> 00:14:28,782
I'm gonna level with you, ma'am.

160
00:14:28,816 --> 00:14:30,317
If you want your husband
out of the house,

161
00:14:30,351 --> 00:14:32,219
you're gonna have to help me out.

162
00:14:32,253 --> 00:14:35,324
Is it possible maybe he's broken
any laws that you know of?

163
00:14:35,358 --> 00:14:37,428
Anything at all.

164
00:14:37,462 --> 00:14:39,832
Anything that we can work
with here, just tell me.

165
00:14:39,866 --> 00:14:42,168
Even if you've just got a
suspicion of wrongdoing,

166
00:14:42,203 --> 00:14:43,404
I can work with that.

167
00:14:43,438 --> 00:14:45,406
I'll get him out of
the house for you.

168
00:14:45,441 --> 00:14:47,376
What's your take on all this?

169
00:14:47,411 --> 00:14:50,281
It-- It's my mom's fault.

170
00:14:50,315 --> 00:14:51,416
I--

171
00:14:54,555 --> 00:14:57,991
and it's because he
didn't do anything.

172
00:14:58,025 --> 00:15:00,660
I don't know whyshe's b.

173
00:15:00,694 --> 00:15:02,861
My-- My dad--

174
00:15:02,896 --> 00:15:05,964
...he is a great guy.

175
00:15:10,335 --> 00:15:11,635
Mrs. White?

176
00:15:15,106 --> 00:15:16,473
I'm sorry, ma'am.

177
00:15:16,507 --> 00:15:18,441
There's no legal basis

178
00:15:18,475 --> 00:15:20,310
for us to remove your
husband from the house.

179
00:15:21,845 --> 00:15:24,480
Next time you feel like things
are getting out of control,

180
00:15:24,514 --> 00:15:25,981
you should call this number.

181
00:15:26,015 --> 00:15:27,849
It's the family hotline.

182
00:15:27,884 --> 00:15:30,251
I'd really look into
some counseling.

183
00:15:32,754 --> 00:15:34,288
Best of luck to you folks.

184
00:15:34,322 --> 00:15:37,157
Listen, thank you, officers.
We're sorry.

185
00:15:44,997 --> 00:15:46,364
Why do you got to--

186
00:15:46,398 --> 00:15:48,166
Why do you got to do this to Dad?

187
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:49,433
Junior. Wait. Come on.

188
00:15:49,468 --> 00:15:51,402
Don't blame your mother for this.

189
00:15:56,406 --> 00:15:57,507
Sorry.

190
00:16:04,247 --> 00:16:07,315
Ah, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.

191
00:16:15,222 --> 00:16:16,622
Welcome home.

192
00:16:59,294 --> 00:17:00,727
He lives!

193
00:17:00,762 --> 00:17:02,829
Happy housewarming, kid.

194
00:17:02,863 --> 00:17:05,697
Don't look so glad
to see me. Thanks.

195
00:17:05,732 --> 00:17:07,866
Interesting decor.

196
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:09,501
It's, uh, subtle.

197
00:17:09,535 --> 00:17:12,236
The whole minimalist thing
never really blew my hair back,

198
00:17:12,270 --> 00:17:13,270
but hey.

199
00:17:13,304 --> 00:17:16,738
So, how are you doing?

200
00:17:16,773 --> 00:17:18,406
You staying clean?

201
00:17:20,309 --> 00:17:21,476
Good.

202
00:17:21,510 --> 00:17:22,544
I was kind of worried

203
00:17:22,578 --> 00:17:23,812
that you were back to old habits,

204
00:17:23,846 --> 00:17:26,081
since I didn't hear from you,
you know?

205
00:17:26,115 --> 00:17:28,616
Realize how stupid it is

206
00:17:28,650 --> 00:17:30,317
to ignore your
counsel's phone calls?

207
00:17:30,352 --> 00:17:31,985
What if I was trying to warn you

208
00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:33,787
that the DEA was going
to kick down your door?

209
00:17:33,821 --> 00:17:35,188
I mean, what then, huh?

210
00:17:35,222 --> 00:17:36,789
Why don't you spare me the sermon

211
00:17:36,823 --> 00:17:38,390
and get to why you're here?

212
00:17:38,424 --> 00:17:39,657
Fair enough.

213
00:17:39,692 --> 00:17:41,159
Remember the other day

214
00:17:41,193 --> 00:17:42,659
when I brought up the idea

215
00:17:42,694 --> 00:17:44,761
of you getting back in touch
with your, uh, partner?

216
00:17:44,795 --> 00:17:47,630
Well, I kind of wanted
to refloat that boat.

217
00:17:47,664 --> 00:17:50,732
I'm not suggesting that you
yourself get back to cooking,

218
00:17:50,767 --> 00:17:52,534
I mean, you being in rehab and all.

219
00:17:52,568 --> 00:17:55,270
I only want you to
convince the master chef

220
00:17:55,304 --> 00:17:56,470
to do his thing,

221
00:17:56,505 --> 00:17:59,506
so what do you say?

222
00:17:59,541 --> 00:18:01,375
Sure, man. Whatever.

223
00:18:01,409 --> 00:18:02,909
Okay. Whatever what?

224
00:18:02,944 --> 00:18:05,545
I mean, you going to call him?

225
00:18:05,579 --> 00:18:07,146
I said I'll handle it.

226
00:18:07,181 --> 00:18:08,882
Now bounce, will you?

227
00:18:08,916 --> 00:18:09,882
Please?

228
00:18:09,917 --> 00:18:11,283
Final thought.

229
00:18:13,019 --> 00:18:14,119
Look at this place.

230
00:18:14,153 --> 00:18:15,388
You're house poor.

231
00:18:15,422 --> 00:18:16,824
You got no bankroll.

232
00:18:16,859 --> 00:18:18,729
If you get the maestro
cooking again,

233
00:18:18,764 --> 00:18:20,798
I'll make it worth your while.

234
00:18:22,867 --> 00:18:23,934
Call him.

235
00:19:10,606 --> 00:19:12,273
<i>Hey, if you're trying to
sell me something,</i>

236
00:19:12,307 --> 00:19:13,741
<i>I've got four little
words for you--</i>

237
00:19:13,775 --> 00:19:15,075
<i>do not call list.</i>

238
00:19:15,110 --> 00:19:17,344
<i>However, if you're cool,
leave it at the beep.</i>

239
00:19:40,096 --> 00:19:42,096
Schrader.

240
00:19:42,131 --> 00:19:44,097
Yes, sir? Yeah, what's up?

241
00:19:46,634 --> 00:19:47,700
Yeah?

242
00:19:49,502 --> 00:19:51,636
Wow!

243
00:19:51,670 --> 00:19:54,008
That's great news, sir. Thank you.

244
00:19:55,011 --> 00:19:56,277
Ah, yeah, yeah. Absolutely.

245
00:19:56,311 --> 00:19:57,444
You can bet on that.

246
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:00,547
Hey, listen, thanks again, sir.

247
00:20:00,582 --> 00:20:02,216
I really appreciate you
stepping to the plate.

248
00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:03,250
Thank you.

249
00:20:07,421 --> 00:20:09,255
You going to keep me
in suspense or what?

250
00:20:09,289 --> 00:20:10,422
What's the good news?

251
00:20:10,456 --> 00:20:12,323
Merkert called in a
couple of favors.

252
00:20:12,357 --> 00:20:14,792
El Paso wants me back. Aaah!

253
00:20:14,826 --> 00:20:18,161
Hey, man, congrats, man.
That's fantastic.

254
00:20:18,196 --> 00:20:19,663
Thank you. Yeah.

255
00:20:20,998 --> 00:20:22,465
Yeah.

256
00:21:03,433 --> 00:21:04,900
Hello.

257
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:39,181
<i>Hey, if you're trying to
sell me something,</i>

258
00:26:39,215 --> 00:26:40,618
<i>I've got four little
words for you--</i>

259
00:26:40,652 --> 00:26:41,920
<i>do not call list.</i>

260
00:26:41,954 --> 00:26:44,660
<i>However, if you're cool,
leave it at the beep.</i>

261
00:26:56,186 --> 00:26:57,856
<i>Hey, if you're trying to
sell me something,</i>

262
00:26:57,890 --> 00:26:59,158
<i>I've got four little
words for you--</i>

263
00:26:59,192 --> 00:27:00,492
<i>do not call list.</i>

264
00:27:00,526 --> 00:27:02,594
<i>However, if you're cool,
leave it at the beep.</i>

265
00:27:05,564 --> 00:27:07,331
<i>Hey, if you're trying to
sell me something,</i>

266
00:27:07,365 --> 00:27:08,698
<i>I've got four little
words for you--</i>

267
00:27:13,869 --> 00:27:15,303
Mmm.

268
00:27:49,561 --> 00:27:51,196
Oh, sweetheart.

269
00:27:51,230 --> 00:27:53,931
Oh, sweetie, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

270
00:27:53,966 --> 00:27:57,568
It's okay. It's okay, my girl.

271
00:27:57,602 --> 00:28:00,703
Oh, yes. It's okay.

272
00:28:00,737 --> 00:28:03,572
It's okay. Mama's got you.

273
00:28:03,606 --> 00:28:07,274
Oh, Mama's got you, yeah.

274
00:28:07,309 --> 00:28:09,544
Yes. Oh.

275
00:28:11,513 --> 00:28:13,780
Skyler, want some help?

276
00:28:25,226 --> 00:28:27,993
Skyler, can I use the bathroom?

277
00:28:41,468 --> 00:28:42,468
G--.

278
00:29:01,555 --> 00:29:03,222
What do you mean?
Against your will?

279
00:29:03,256 --> 00:29:06,024
Yes. Very much against my will.

280
00:29:06,059 --> 00:29:08,193
He just-- He-
He showed right back up,

281
00:29:08,227 --> 00:29:10,361
and he-- he doesn't want a divorce.

282
00:29:10,396 --> 00:29:12,696
Won't even consider it.

283
00:29:12,731 --> 00:29:16,634
I-- I called the police on him.

284
00:29:16,668 --> 00:29:19,203
I-- I was-- I was so clo--

285
00:29:20,539 --> 00:29:21,772
So close to what?

286
00:29:21,806 --> 00:29:23,773
Nothing. Never mind.

287
00:29:23,808 --> 00:29:27,643
Skyler, I can't advise you properly

288
00:29:27,677 --> 00:29:29,345
if you don't give me all the facts.

289
00:29:29,379 --> 00:29:31,580
Understand I am bound

290
00:29:31,614 --> 00:29:33,181
by the attorney-client privilege

291
00:29:33,215 --> 00:29:35,183
to keep everything
you tell me a secret.

292
00:29:35,217 --> 00:29:38,786
I can't tell a soul unless
you authorize me to.

293
00:29:38,820 --> 00:29:41,555
Even if it's something illegal?

294
00:29:41,589 --> 00:29:44,457
Especially if it's illegal.

295
00:29:44,491 --> 00:29:46,392
I'm your lawyer, not the police.

296
00:29:46,426 --> 00:29:49,494
My job is to protect you.

297
00:29:58,436 --> 00:30:01,204
My husband makes meth.

298
00:30:02,906 --> 00:30:04,874
Methamphetamine.

299
00:30:08,144 --> 00:30:09,611
Your husband's a drug dealer.

300
00:30:09,645 --> 00:30:10,678
A manufacturer.

301
00:30:10,713 --> 00:30:13,814
Technically, they, uh,

302
00:30:13,849 --> 00:30:16,684
they-- they call them cooks.

303
00:30:16,718 --> 00:30:19,019
I looked it up on the Internet.

304
00:30:19,053 --> 00:30:23,189
This is my advice,
and you should take it.

305
00:30:23,224 --> 00:30:25,925
Sue your husband for
divorce immediately.

306
00:30:25,959 --> 00:30:27,726
Let me go to the police

307
00:30:27,761 --> 00:30:29,895
and tell them what
you've just told me.

308
00:30:29,929 --> 00:30:31,229
I'll go in ex parte

309
00:30:31,263 --> 00:30:33,631
and get a restraining order
from the court today.

310
00:30:33,665 --> 00:30:35,733
If he comes anywhere near
you and your children,

311
00:30:35,767 --> 00:30:38,568
he goes straight to jail,
no questions asked.

312
00:30:38,603 --> 00:30:40,303
This is a no-brainer.

313
00:30:40,338 --> 00:30:43,340
It's the best thing for
you and your family.

314
00:30:45,677 --> 00:30:47,044
I can't.

315
00:30:50,081 --> 00:30:51,181
I can't do it.

316
00:30:52,217 --> 00:30:56,020
I don't want my son to find out

317
00:30:56,054 --> 00:30:58,122
that his father is a criminal.

318
00:30:58,156 --> 00:30:59,990
I just--

319
00:31:01,593 --> 00:31:03,427
I can't do that to him.

320
00:31:03,461 --> 00:31:07,064
In the end,
it may not be up to you.

321
00:31:07,098 --> 00:31:09,600
Drug dealers have a
way of getting caught.

322
00:31:12,037 --> 00:31:15,639
Walt has lung cancer.

323
00:31:15,674 --> 00:31:17,708
His treatment bought him some time,

324
00:31:17,742 --> 00:31:19,176
but the doctors, they all say

325
00:31:19,210 --> 00:31:20,877
that sooner or later--

326
00:31:20,912 --> 00:31:24,081
But I can't see why

327
00:31:24,115 --> 00:31:26,283
I should lay all this on my family

328
00:31:26,317 --> 00:31:29,420
when...things may--

329
00:31:31,690 --> 00:31:36,160
resolve themselves on their own

330
00:31:36,194 --> 00:31:40,397
without anyone else knowing.

331
00:31:46,441 --> 00:31:48,710
Man, did I lose a bet or something?

332
00:31:50,579 --> 00:31:52,013
What are we doing in this shithole?

333
00:31:52,047 --> 00:31:53,248
Just relax, will you?

334
00:31:53,282 --> 00:31:56,017
Relax? This is the kind
of place you get knifed.

335
00:31:56,051 --> 00:31:57,619
We should have went
to Chili's, man.

336
00:31:57,653 --> 00:31:59,387
All right, already. J----.

337
00:31:59,421 --> 00:32:01,122
Outback Steakhouse.

338
00:32:01,157 --> 00:32:02,157
It's not too late.

339
00:32:02,191 --> 00:32:04,159
They got that Blooming Onion.

340
00:32:04,193 --> 00:32:06,595
What's wrong with spicing
things up a little bit, huh?

341
00:32:06,629 --> 00:32:11,232
This spice looks like it's been
through a couple of guys already.

342
00:32:11,267 --> 00:32:13,935
So when are you headed
back down to El Paso?

343
00:32:13,969 --> 00:32:15,270
Uh, you know,

344
00:32:15,304 --> 00:32:18,306
between the packing
and errands and, uh,

345
00:32:18,340 --> 00:32:21,042
getting my ducks in a row,
maybe, um, a week or two.

346
00:32:21,077 --> 00:32:23,011
A week or two? Come on, man.

347
00:32:23,045 --> 00:32:24,980
I'd be dying to get
back in the action.

348
00:32:25,014 --> 00:32:27,514
Yeah, well, it's not like there's
nothing going on up here.

349
00:32:27,549 --> 00:32:28,881
What are you talking about?

350
00:32:28,916 --> 00:32:30,582
There ain't jack going on up here.

351
00:32:30,617 --> 00:32:33,185
It's quiet as hell.

352
00:32:33,219 --> 00:32:35,454
I'm going to hit the head.

353
00:33:07,186 --> 00:33:08,686
Those two over there.

354
00:33:10,122 --> 00:33:11,456
I think they're holding.

355
00:33:13,659 --> 00:33:14,826
Man, in this place,

356
00:33:14,860 --> 00:33:16,527
the bartender's probably holding.

357
00:33:21,666 --> 00:33:22,800
All right.

358
00:33:22,834 --> 00:33:24,134
Whoa. What are you doing?

359
00:33:24,169 --> 00:33:25,435
Calling APD. What do you think?

360
00:33:25,470 --> 00:33:27,904
Since when can't we handle
a couple of dirtballs?

361
00:33:27,939 --> 00:33:29,439
Come on, man. Courtesy call.

362
00:33:29,474 --> 00:33:32,342
What if Vice is running
some kind if undercover op?

363
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:39,549
Screw it. It's your turn to pay.

364
00:34:14,237 --> 00:34:15,470
Where are you going?

365
00:34:15,505 --> 00:34:16,738
I have to take a leak.

366
00:34:16,772 --> 00:34:19,107
J----, get yourself some Flomax.

367
00:34:30,519 --> 00:34:31,919
Stand up.

368
00:34:38,691 --> 00:34:43,024
Do you got a problem
with us, bitch?

369
00:34:43,058 --> 00:34:44,658
Your move.

370
00:35:12,875 --> 00:35:15,175
DEA! Don't move.

371
00:35:21,347 --> 00:35:23,247
Go tell my partner to
get his ass in here.

372
00:35:58,017 --> 00:35:59,751
<i>Hey, if you're trying to
sell me something,</i>

373
00:35:59,785 --> 00:36:01,219
<i>I've got four little
words for you--</i>

374
00:36:01,253 --> 00:36:02,654
<i>do not call list.</i>

375
00:36:02,688 --> 00:36:05,322
<i>However, if you're cool,
leave it at the beep.</i>

376
00:36:16,432 --> 00:36:18,100
<i>Hey, if you're trying to
sell me something,</i>

377
00:36:18,134 --> 00:36:19,801
<i>I've got four little
words for you--</i>

378
00:36:19,835 --> 00:36:21,035
<i>do not call--</i>

379
00:36:34,414 --> 00:36:36,616
<i>We're sorry. You have
reached a number</i>

380
00:36:36,650 --> 00:36:40,252
<i>that has been disconnected or
is no longer in service.</i>

381
00:38:02,951 --> 00:38:03,950
Come on.

382
00:38:20,335 --> 00:38:20,368
Skyler.

383
00:38:24,872 --> 00:38:26,406
Can we talk?

384
00:38:42,354 --> 00:38:44,521
ASAC wants to see you.

385
00:38:46,657 --> 00:38:47,857
And?

386
00:38:47,891 --> 00:38:50,993
We're hanging back.
Saw a deal go down.

387
00:38:51,027 --> 00:38:52,694
I went outside to call it in.

388
00:38:52,729 --> 00:38:55,030
You stayed to keep an
eye on the suspects.

389
00:38:55,064 --> 00:38:56,697
That's when they attacked you.

390
00:39:03,404 --> 00:39:04,771
What I didn't tell them

391
00:39:04,805 --> 00:39:06,739
is that you left your
gun under the seat

392
00:39:06,774 --> 00:39:09,341
before you went back inside.

393
00:39:25,023 --> 00:39:27,457
I've done a terrible thing,

394
00:39:27,492 --> 00:39:29,826
but I did it for a good reason.

395
00:39:31,962 --> 00:39:34,563
I did it for us.

396
00:39:36,132 --> 00:39:38,800
That...

397
00:39:38,834 --> 00:39:42,136
is college tuition
for Walter Junior

398
00:39:42,170 --> 00:39:44,037
and Holly,

399
00:39:44,072 --> 00:39:45,705
18 years down the road.

400
00:39:45,740 --> 00:39:46,940
Huh?

401
00:39:49,677 --> 00:39:53,546
Then it's health insurance
for you and the kids,

402
00:39:53,580 --> 00:39:56,082
for Junior's physical therapy,

403
00:39:56,116 --> 00:39:59,318
his SAT tutor.

404
00:40:01,221 --> 00:40:04,490
It's money for groceries

405
00:40:04,524 --> 00:40:07,093
and gas,

406
00:40:07,127 --> 00:40:11,530
for birthdays and
graduation parties.

407
00:40:14,201 --> 00:40:16,301
Skyler, that money

408
00:40:16,336 --> 00:40:19,037
is for this roof over your head,

409
00:40:19,071 --> 00:40:21,672
the mortgage that you are not
going to be able to afford

410
00:40:21,707 --> 00:40:24,742
on a part-time bookkeeper's
salary when I'm gone.

411
00:40:24,776 --> 00:40:26,444
Walt, I-- Please.

412
00:40:26,478 --> 00:40:28,212
Please.

413
00:40:33,918 --> 00:40:36,552
This money...

414
00:40:36,587 --> 00:40:38,554
I didn't steal it.

415
00:40:38,589 --> 00:40:41,991
it doesn't belong to anyone else.

416
00:40:42,025 --> 00:40:43,925
I earned it.

417
00:40:45,528 --> 00:40:47,962
The things I've...

418
00:40:47,996 --> 00:40:52,032
done to earn it...

419
00:40:52,066 --> 00:40:53,399
the...

420
00:40:57,837 --> 00:40:58,904
the...

421
00:40:58,938 --> 00:41:02,373
things I've hato do,

422
00:41:02,407 --> 00:41:06,709
I've got to live with them.

423
00:41:13,082 --> 00:41:14,383
Skyler.

424
00:41:17,720 --> 00:41:19,722
All that I've done,

425
00:41:19,756 --> 00:41:23,659
all the sacrifices that I have...

426
00:41:23,694 --> 00:41:25,729
made for this family,

427
00:41:25,763 --> 00:41:28,668
all of that will be for nothing

428
00:41:28,702 --> 00:41:31,907
if you don't accept
what I've earned.

429
00:41:33,110 --> 00:41:34,481
Please.

430
00:41:38,659 --> 00:41:41,563
I'll be here when you
get home from work.

431
00:41:43,968 --> 00:41:46,269
You can give me your answer then.

432
00:42:08,692 --> 00:42:10,193
Hey, Sky.

433
00:42:10,227 --> 00:42:11,327
Hi.

434
00:43:07,617 --> 00:43:08,617
Ahem.

435
00:43:08,651 --> 00:43:10,853
Uh, some coffee?

436
00:43:11,888 --> 00:43:12,921
Yeah.

437
00:43:14,023 --> 00:43:15,891
That report's looking real good.

438
00:43:15,925 --> 00:43:18,627
That-- I like how it looks. Good.

439
00:43:27,403 --> 00:43:29,337
Are your kids home?

440
00:43:32,574 --> 00:43:33,775
Ahem.

441
00:44:08,376 --> 00:44:09,910
<i>Ooh! Ooh!</i>

442
00:44:09,945 --> 00:44:11,445
<i>Ooh, it's here, it's here!</i>

443
00:44:15,417 --> 00:44:17,753
Hello, Mrs. White.

444
00:44:17,787 --> 00:44:20,623
Oh. Hi, Louis.

445
00:44:20,657 --> 00:44:23,426
Hey, uh, thanks for
having me over for dinner.

446
00:44:24,762 --> 00:44:25,996
Um, sure.

447
00:44:26,030 --> 00:44:28,365
Hey, Skyler.

448
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:32,102
I'm, uh, cooking dinner.

449
00:44:32,137 --> 00:44:34,071
Pot roast.

450
00:44:34,105 --> 00:44:36,206
Uh, could you--

451
00:44:56,087 --> 00:44:58,888
So how was your day?

452
00:45:00,657 --> 00:45:02,191
Good.

453
00:45:02,225 --> 00:45:05,060
Good. Excellent.

454
00:45:05,094 --> 00:45:06,595
I hope you don't mind.

455
00:45:06,629 --> 00:45:10,699
I invited Louis to stay
for dinner tonight,

456
00:45:10,733 --> 00:45:11,967
you know, as a thank you

457
00:45:12,001 --> 00:45:15,270
for driving Walter
Junior to school for us.

458
00:45:15,305 --> 00:45:18,240
We've been kind of absent,

459
00:45:18,275 --> 00:45:22,812
but I tell you,
Louis really pitched in.

460
00:45:25,216 --> 00:45:26,884
Um...

461
00:45:29,153 --> 00:45:32,688
Look, I just want to say that I--

462
00:45:32,722 --> 00:45:34,622
I feel good about our
talk this morning,

463
00:45:34,656 --> 00:45:35,889
and I'm-- I'm very eager

464
00:45:35,924 --> 00:45:37,990
to hear what you're
thinking about--

465
00:45:38,025 --> 00:45:39,958
about what we talked about.

466
00:45:39,993 --> 00:45:41,192
But, you know,

467
00:45:41,227 --> 00:45:43,027
whenever you're ready, of course.

468
00:45:44,829 --> 00:45:45,895
Yeah.

469
00:45:48,364 --> 00:45:49,464
Hmm.

470
00:45:49,499 --> 00:45:53,802
Honesty is good. Don't you think?

471
00:46:03,012 --> 00:46:04,179
There.

472
00:46:16,625 --> 00:46:18,760
I fucked Ted.

473
00:46:27,770 --> 00:46:29,804
Boys, dinner.

474
00:46:35,477 --> 00:46:36,577
Thank you. Louis?

475
00:46:36,611 --> 00:46:38,512
Uh, yes, please. All right.

476
00:46:38,546 --> 00:46:39,713
Thank you.

477
00:46:40,981 --> 00:46:43,483
I want you boys both to
eat your salad, okay?

478
00:46:43,517 --> 00:46:44,584
Okay.

479
00:46:44,618 --> 00:46:45,985
I know.

480
00:46:46,019 --> 00:46:47,720
Nobody likes salad,

481
00:46:47,754 --> 00:46:50,089
but it's good for you.

482
00:46:50,123 --> 00:46:51,657
Thanks, darling. Thank you.
