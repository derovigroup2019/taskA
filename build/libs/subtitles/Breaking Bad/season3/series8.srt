Yeah. Whatever.

00:01:55,491 --> 00:01:57,558
Uh, sir,
if you'd like to smoke,

5
00:01:57,593 --> 00:02:00,027
you need to be another
20 feet from the door.

Male Caucasian.

10
00:02:26,755 --> 00:02:27,955
Early 40s.

00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:29,524
Multiple gunshot wounds.

Weak and thready

No breath sounds

18
00:02:44,039 --> 00:02:45,606
How many entry wounds?

19
00:02:45,641 --> 00:02:47,375
We found four-- shoulder and
hip, through and through.

You okay?

[Gale] I don't understand.

I thought things were
going pretty well.

I--

44
00:04:27,142 --> 00:04:29,277
I thought we were

45
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:30,544
you know?

46
00:04:30,579 --> 00:04:33,247

Is this about the temperature
setting the other day?

49
00:04:40,055 --> 00:04:42,490
Because I can assure you
that will not happen--

50
00:04:42,524 --> 00:04:44,358
No, it's bigger
than that, Gale.

51
00:04:44,393 --> 00:04:48,296
It's-- It's-- It's
much more than that.

52
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:50,264
Could you elaborate?

53
00:04:50,299 --> 00:04:53,167
Well, uh, yes,
of course I could,

54
00:04:53,201 --> 00:04:56,170

00:05:04,012 --> 00:05:05,646
Yeah.

to show you.

What, now?

00:07:40,302 --> 00:07:41,902
Yes, now.

112
00:07:41,937 --> 00:07:43,370
We've only got a couple days

113
00:07:43,405 --> 00:07:45,339
before our next batch is due,

114
00:07:45,373 --> 00:07:48,075
and I need to get you
up to speed.

115
00:07:48,110 --> 00:07:49,677
Right on.

116
00:07:49,711 --> 00:07:51,479
I'm just saying--

117
00:07:53,849 --> 00:07:55,950
How's the cell service
down here?

118
00:07:55,984 --> 00:07:57,785
It's nonexistent.

119
00:07:57,819 --> 00:07:59,386
We're shielded.

120
00:07:59,421 --> 00:08:01,922
There's a hard line
for emergencies. Come on.

121
00:08:01,957 --> 00:08:04,458
So you haven't talked
to anybody today

122
00:08:04,493 --> 00:08:07,094
other than, you know,
Captain Nerd there.

123
00:08:07,129 --> 00:08:09,396
Why?

124
00:08:09,431 --> 00:08:12,233
Your brother-in-law.

125
00:08:12,267 --> 00:08:14,635
What about him?

126
00:08:17,839 --> 00:08:19,607
So what's the story?
Upon arrival, he was unresponsive.

127
00:08:19,641 --> 00:08:21,442
Take a look. You getting some
exposure on those wounds?

128
00:08:21,476 --> 00:08:22,476
...blood pressure of 80.

00:08:22,511 --> 00:08:23,744
2 units of normal saline.

He's got breath sounds
bilaterally.

132
00:08:26,248 --> 00:08:27,848
This femur feels
like a wet bag of gravel.

133
00:08:27,883 --> 00:08:29,350
The other one's
not much better.

134
00:08:29,384 --> 00:08:30,518
Let's get those boots off.

135
00:08:30,552 --> 00:08:31,519
See if you get a pulse.

136
00:08:31,553 --> 00:08:33,754
You get a blood pressure
cup or an ABI?

137
00:08:33,788 --> 00:08:35,089
Where's that blood?

138
00:08:40,729 --> 00:08:42,329
Sir, can I help you?

139
00:08:42,364 --> 00:08:43,430
Uh, yeah, I--

140
00:08:43,465 --> 00:08:44,732
It's all right.
He's family.

141
00:08:44,766 --> 00:08:45,766
Thank you.

142
00:08:46,768 --> 00:08:47,835

143
00:08:47,869 --> 00:08:50,137
I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry.

144

Hey.

145
00:08:56,545 --> 00:08:57,811
I'm so sorry.

146
00:08:57,846 --> 00:08:59,980
I don't know what to say.

147
00:09:07,622 --> 00:09:08,923
How is he?

148
00:09:08,957 --> 00:09:10,891
I don't know. They won't
really tell us anything.

149
00:09:10,926 --> 00:09:12,726
He's still in surgery.

150
00:09:14,062 --> 00:09:16,030
They shot him four times.

151
00:09:17,832 --> 00:09:19,066
Oh, Christ.

152
00:09:24,172 --> 00:09:25,573
Where's Holly?

153
00:09:25,607 --> 00:09:27,408
I got a sitter.

154
00:09:28,944 --> 00:09:31,779
Hey. How are you, huh?

155
00:09:31,813 --> 00:09:33,914
Fine.
Yeah?

156
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:36,584
Sure?

157
00:09:37,919 --> 00:09:40,754
I-- I'm fine. I just need
some fresh air.

158
00:09:42,924 --> 00:09:44,825
Okay.

159
00:09:44,859 --> 00:09:46,160
Here.
Let me get the door.

160
00:09:46,194 --> 00:09:48,929
I got it. I'm fine.

161
00:09:52,133 --> 00:09:53,867
Walt.
Hmm?

162
00:09:53,902 --> 00:09:56,237
Walt, this is ASAC Merkert.

163
00:09:56,271 --> 00:09:57,738
Hank's
brother-in-law Walt.

164
00:09:57,772 --> 00:09:59,106
Hello.

165
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:00,140
I'm very sorry.

166
00:10:00,175 --> 00:10:01,208
Thank you. Uh--

167
00:10:01,243 --> 00:10:02,977
Can you tell us anything

168
00:10:03,011 --> 00:10:04,912
or any details?

169
00:10:04,946 --> 00:10:06,146
Right now, all we know

170
00:10:06,181 --> 00:10:07,681
is two men ambushed Hank.

171
00:10:07,716 --> 00:10:09,583
They didn't have any I.D.
on them.

172
00:10:09,618 --> 00:10:10,918
Probably Mexican nationals.

173
00:10:10,952 --> 00:10:13,854
Their tattoos
indicated an affiliation

174
00:10:13,888 --> 00:10:15,556
with the drug cartel.

175
00:10:17,492 --> 00:10:19,893
Why did they attack Hank?

176
00:10:19,928 --> 00:10:21,562
We're not sure yet.

177
00:10:21,596 --> 00:10:24,098
It could be in relation

178
00:10:24,132 --> 00:10:26,000
to an investigation
that Hank was working,

179
00:10:26,034 --> 00:10:29,870
or it could be a message
to the DEA in general.

180
00:10:32,641 --> 00:10:34,241
They had an ax.

181
00:10:34,276 --> 00:10:38,045
The cartels tend
to be dramatic.

182
00:10:39,314 --> 00:10:40,714
Oh, Jesus.

183
00:10:42,784 --> 00:10:44,918
Where are they?
I mean, did they--

184
00:10:44,953 --> 00:10:46,620
Hank got both of them.

185
00:10:46,655 --> 00:10:48,289
He killed one outright,

186
00:10:48,323 --> 00:10:49,890
and the other one's upstairs

187
00:10:49,924 --> 00:10:51,058
in critical condition.

188
00:10:51,092 --> 00:10:53,060
Your brother-in-law's
one tough son of a bitch

189
00:10:53,094 --> 00:10:54,461
to take them both out,

190
00:10:54,496 --> 00:10:56,730
considering he didn't
even have his gun.

191
00:10:59,768 --> 00:11:01,669
He didn't have his gun?

192
00:11:05,974 --> 00:11:08,976
Why didn't Hank have his gun?

193
00:11:09,978 --> 00:11:12,246
Marie, the assault charge.

194
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:15,449
I had to suspend Hank
pending the investigation.

195
00:11:15,483 --> 00:11:18,819
That means I had to
take away his weapon.

196
00:11:18,853 --> 00:11:20,154
[muttering]

197
00:11:20,188 --> 00:11:21,922
It's standard procedure.
No one--

198
00:11:21,956 --> 00:11:23,290
Okay, All right. Listen.

199
00:11:23,325 --> 00:11:25,192
If you would have all
listened to him

200
00:11:25,226 --> 00:11:26,360
right from the start,

201
00:11:26,394 --> 00:11:28,295
and let him arrest
that little degenerate,

202
00:11:28,330 --> 00:11:31,165
he wouldn't have had to take
things into his own hands,

203
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:33,434
and he would have had a gun
and defended himself.

204
00:11:33,468 --> 00:11:34,601
Marie,
let's just--

205
00:11:34,636 --> 00:11:35,636
No. Just--

206
00:11:37,872 --> 00:11:39,673
It's their fault.

207
00:11:39,708 --> 00:11:42,209
He didn't have a gun.

208
00:11:42,243 --> 00:11:44,311
Honey, this isn't helping you.

209
00:11:44,346 --> 00:11:46,180
You.

210
00:11:46,214 --> 00:11:48,782
What kind of partner are you?

211
00:11:50,685 --> 00:11:52,586
You were supposed
to back him up,

212
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:54,054
and where were you?

213
00:11:54,089 --> 00:11:56,090
Where were you?

214
00:11:56,124 --> 00:11:57,791
Texas.

215
00:11:59,361 --> 00:12:01,495
And you.

216
00:12:01,529 --> 00:12:04,832
You're supposed to
protect your agents

217
00:12:04,866 --> 00:12:07,201
instead of taking their guns,

218
00:12:07,235 --> 00:12:08,635
not supporting them,

219
00:12:08,670 --> 00:12:10,037
not backing them up--

220
00:12:10,071 --> 00:12:11,705
Marie. Marie.
...when they--

221
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:16,777
Honey, let's just go
and sit down, okay?

222
00:12:16,811 --> 00:12:18,145
I'm not doing anything

223
00:12:18,179 --> 00:12:20,381
until these two get
the hell out of here.

224
00:12:20,415 --> 00:12:21,515
I mean it.

225
00:12:27,389 --> 00:12:28,889
Sorry--
Go.

226
00:12:28,923 --> 00:12:31,158
You are not welcome here.

227
00:12:31,192 --> 00:12:34,061
The DEA is not welcome here.

228
00:12:34,095 --> 00:12:35,429
Honey.

229
00:12:35,463 --> 00:12:36,830
Come on.

230
00:12:36,865 --> 00:12:38,766
Come on. Let's go sit down.

231
00:12:51,813 --> 00:12:53,447
It's not just them.

232
00:12:55,216 --> 00:12:57,518
It's you, Walt.

233
00:13:03,958 --> 00:13:08,962
This Pinkman that Hank
was looking for--

234
00:13:08,997 --> 00:13:12,099
Hank would have never
even heard his name

235
00:13:12,133 --> 00:13:15,936
if you hadn't bought
marijuana from him.

236
00:13:15,970 --> 00:13:17,004
Marie--

237
00:13:17,038 --> 00:13:19,106
Do you ever think
about that, Walt?

238
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:21,008
Do you?

239
00:13:21,042 --> 00:13:23,310
Do you ever think
about everything

240
00:13:23,344 --> 00:13:24,812
that you have put him through?

241
00:13:24,846 --> 00:13:26,079
[Skyler] Marie, stop.

242
00:13:26,114 --> 00:13:28,682
You're upset,

243
00:13:28,716 --> 00:13:30,083
and you're looking
for someone to blame,

244
00:13:30,118 --> 00:13:32,719
and it's understandable,
but don't blame Walt.

245
00:13:32,754 --> 00:13:34,822
It's not his fault.

246
00:13:42,464 --> 00:13:43,530
I'm sorry.

247
00:13:43,565 --> 00:13:45,065
I'm sorry.

248
00:13:45,099 --> 00:13:46,767
Sweetheart. No.
No. No. Don't--

249
00:13:46,801 --> 00:13:48,602
[sobbing]

250
00:13:50,905 --> 00:13:52,840
It's okay.

251
00:13:52,874 --> 00:13:54,975
It's Hank--

252
00:13:55,009 --> 00:13:57,211
It's all right.

253
00:13:57,245 --> 00:13:58,345
Shh.

254
00:13:58,379 --> 00:14:00,347
[sobbing]

255
00:14:12,244 --> 00:14:14,145
All right, you're done.

256
00:14:17,082 --> 00:14:18,482
Okay, next.

257
00:15:52,544 --> 00:15:53,978
Hello!

258
00:15:56,348 --> 00:15:59,817
[imitating echo] Hello,
hello, hello, hello, hello.

259
00:16:05,023 --> 00:16:06,790
Yeah.

260
00:16:06,825 --> 00:16:07,958
Wow.

261
00:16:08,994 --> 00:16:10,528
[grunt]

262
00:16:15,567 --> 00:16:17,601
Yo, yo, yo!

263
00:16:17,636 --> 00:16:20,070
Jesse Pinkman in the house!

264
00:16:23,041 --> 00:16:27,511
Oh, my dear God.

265
00:16:35,453 --> 00:16:36,720
[laughs]

266
00:16:39,758 --> 00:16:41,091
Wow.

267
00:17:02,347 --> 00:17:03,681
[beep]

268
00:17:03,715 --> 00:17:06,283
<i>Walter White to the nearest
courtesy phone.</i>

269
00:17:06,318 --> 00:17:09,620
<i>Walter White, please
pick up a courtesy phone.</i>

270
00:17:20,999 --> 00:17:24,668
<i>[Jesse] Yo.
We working sometime this year?</i>

271
00:17:24,703 --> 00:17:26,303
What the hell
are you thinking?

272
00:17:26,338 --> 00:17:28,339
Why are you calling me here?

273
00:17:28,373 --> 00:17:30,808
I tried your cell, and it
went straight to voice mail.

274
00:17:30,842 --> 00:17:32,676
How else am I supposed
to get hold of you?

275
00:17:32,711 --> 00:17:33,844
You aren't.

276
00:17:33,878 --> 00:17:35,579
<i>Look, man,
it's been a whole day.</i>

277
00:17:35,614 --> 00:17:36,847
<i>How long is this
grieving process?</i>

278
00:17:36,881 --> 00:17:38,682
Just put a clock on it for me.

279
00:17:38,717 --> 00:17:41,952
<i>All's I'm saying is
we have a schedule, right?</i>

280
00:17:41,987 --> 00:17:44,455
My family comes
before your schedule.

281
00:17:44,489 --> 00:17:46,690
<i>Dude, it's not
my schedule.</i>

282
00:17:46,725 --> 00:17:48,626
We have responsibilities here.

283
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:51,395
<i>I'll get there
when I get there.</i>

284
00:17:51,429 --> 00:17:53,831
You know what? Whatever.

285
00:17:53,865 --> 00:17:55,399
I'll just cook on my own.

286
00:17:55,433 --> 00:17:56,834
You will do no such thing.

287
00:17:56,868 --> 00:17:57,868
<i>Why not?</i>

288
00:17:59,504 --> 00:18:01,272
<i>Well, uh, for starters,</i>

289
00:18:01,306 --> 00:18:03,307
<i>you aren't
the least bit familiar</i>

290
00:18:03,341 --> 00:18:04,608
with any of the equipment.

291
00:18:04,643 --> 00:18:07,044
<i>There's got to be some
sort of manual, right?</i>

292
00:18:07,078 --> 00:18:08,245
And I can read.

293
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:10,080
Jesse, touch nothing.

294
00:18:10,115 --> 00:18:12,516
Yo, stop treating me
I'm like your assistant.

295
00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:14,251
I'm not your bitch
to order around.

296
00:18:14,286 --> 00:18:15,486
We're partners.

297
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:16,820
<i>Remember?</i>

298
00:18:16,855 --> 00:18:19,990
I need you to sit patiently

299
00:18:20,025 --> 00:18:22,926
and wait, and I will be there
as soon as I can.

300
00:18:22,961 --> 00:18:25,095
Thank you very much
for your kind words.

301
00:18:25,130 --> 00:18:27,064
We-- We really do
appreciate that.

302
00:18:27,098 --> 00:18:28,766
What, is your wife there?

303
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:31,035
<i>Uh, yes. Yes, she is,</i>

304
00:18:31,069 --> 00:18:33,971
and she would be happy to know
that you asked about her.

305
00:18:34,005 --> 00:18:35,973
And please do keep us
in your thoughts.

306
00:18:36,007 --> 00:18:37,975
Hey, tell your douche-bag
brother-in-law

307
00:18:38,009 --> 00:18:39,476
<i>to head towards the light.</i>

308
00:18:42,514 --> 00:18:44,415
So I'm thinking, um,

309
00:18:44,449 --> 00:18:46,450
maybe we should go get
everybody some breakfast.

310
00:18:46,484 --> 00:18:48,319
Yeah. That sounds good.

311
00:18:48,353 --> 00:18:50,154
Do you know who that was?

312
00:19:05,070 --> 00:19:10,574
You know, these eggs
are really not too bad.

313
00:19:24,155 --> 00:19:25,122
Look at that.

314
00:19:25,156 --> 00:19:26,490
Look at what?

315
00:19:26,524 --> 00:19:29,827
At what? This. These spots.

316
00:19:29,861 --> 00:19:32,696
This fork is absolutely filthy.

317
00:19:37,102 --> 00:19:38,836
Tell me you see this.

318
00:19:38,870 --> 00:19:40,571
You've got good eyes.
Look at that.

319
00:19:40,605 --> 00:19:43,440
Marie, those
are just water spots.

320
00:19:43,475 --> 00:19:45,008
Fork is fine.

321
00:19:45,043 --> 00:19:47,611
Those are not water spots.

322
00:19:47,645 --> 00:19:49,980
That's dirt.

323
00:19:50,014 --> 00:19:53,650
This silverware's
obviously not been cleaned.

324
00:19:53,685 --> 00:19:56,920
It's covered in germs
from someone else's mouth.

325
00:19:56,955 --> 00:19:58,956
God knows what.

326
00:19:58,990 --> 00:20:03,360
Seriously, Aunt Marie,
it's water spots.

327
00:20:03,395 --> 00:20:06,597
Ours at home aren't any better.

328
00:20:06,631 --> 00:20:08,399
Yours at home are irrelevant.

329
00:20:08,433 --> 00:20:09,933
We're in a hospital.

330
00:20:09,968 --> 00:20:12,035
They need to be held
to a higher standard.

331
00:20:12,070 --> 00:20:13,337
They have a responsibility.

332
00:20:13,371 --> 00:20:15,172
Well, I'm not actually sure

333
00:20:15,206 --> 00:20:17,775
if the cafeteria
necessarily qualifies

334
00:20:17,809 --> 00:20:19,076
as being part of a hospital.

335
00:20:19,110 --> 00:20:20,911
It's in the same building.

336
00:20:20,945 --> 00:20:22,279
It's all under the same roof.

337
00:20:22,313 --> 00:20:24,748
Do you think that sick
people aren't eating

338
00:20:24,783 --> 00:20:26,950
with this bacteria-infected
silverware?

339
00:20:26,985 --> 00:20:29,820
My Gpd, how are you supposed
to survive this death trap?

340
00:20:33,057 --> 00:20:34,324
[Skyler] Marie.

341
00:20:37,662 --> 00:20:39,296
I survived.

342
00:20:40,665 --> 00:20:43,367
I had my lumpectomy
at this hospital.

343
00:20:43,401 --> 00:20:44,568
Remember that?

344
00:20:46,037 --> 00:20:48,172
Remember how scared
we all were?

345
00:20:48,206 --> 00:20:49,306
Whoo.

346
00:20:49,340 --> 00:20:51,442
I didn't want to act like it,

347
00:20:51,476 --> 00:20:54,945
but I was terrified.

348
00:20:54,979 --> 00:20:57,981
All that week,
all I could think of

349
00:20:58,016 --> 00:21:02,820
was how they were actually
going to cut me open

350
00:21:02,854 --> 00:21:06,523
and take out a part of me

351
00:21:06,558 --> 00:21:09,326
that was with me
my entire life.

352
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:11,728
I couldn't get that image
out of my head.

353
00:21:13,698 --> 00:21:16,066
I think the scariest part

354
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:18,168
was when...

355
00:21:18,203 --> 00:21:20,571
They took me into pre-op,

356
00:21:20,605 --> 00:21:23,640
lying there,

357
00:21:23,675 --> 00:21:26,076
waiting for them
to anesthetize you,

358
00:21:26,110 --> 00:21:29,112
knowing that...

359
00:21:29,147 --> 00:21:30,981
You may never wake up again.

360
00:21:36,588 --> 00:21:39,590
[chuckles] Actually,

361
00:21:39,624 --> 00:21:42,659
what I really remember
about that day

362
00:21:42,694 --> 00:21:45,195
is driving to the hospital.

363
00:21:45,230 --> 00:21:48,298
Skyler, you remember me
wanting to drive that day?

364
00:21:48,333 --> 00:21:50,501
Yeah.

365
00:21:50,535 --> 00:21:54,638
Anyway, there we are.
We're driving up Central,

366
00:21:54,672 --> 00:21:58,008
and we hit every green light--

367
00:21:58,042 --> 00:22:00,711
I mean, every single light
that we hit--

368
00:22:00,745 --> 00:22:03,313

371
00:22:08,186 --> 00:22:11,154
Just like bang, bang,

372
00:22:11,189 --> 00:22:13,524
green the entire way.

373
00:22:13,558 --> 00:22:16,326
And the whole time,
all I could think about

374
00:22:16,361 --> 00:22:20,764
was "Why today? Why?

375
00:22:20,798 --> 00:22:24,768
"Why can't I just spend
a few extra minutes

376
00:22:24,802 --> 00:22:26,637
in the car with my family?"

377
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:32,743
I never wanted to be stuck
in traffic so bad in my life.

378
00:22:34,078 --> 00:22:36,580
At least I was with my family.

379
00:22:39,317 --> 00:22:40,951
I had that.

380
00:22:45,823 --> 00:22:50,227
Anyway, I survived this place.

381
00:22:51,663 --> 00:22:54,898

your husband is.

385
00:23:26,464 --> 00:23:28,632
I was going to ask you
the same question.

00:23:31,002 --> 00:23:32,936
<i>I heard they they
attacked a DEA agent.</i>

387
00:23:32,971 --> 00:23:34,204
<i>Why would they do that?</i>

388
00:23:40,011 --> 00:23:41,545
I didn't order this,

389
00:23:41,579 --> 00:23:43,714
and my men would never
do this on their own.

390
00:23:43,748 --> 00:23:46,350
Someone gave the go-ahead.

391
00:23:46,384 --> 00:23:49,052
<i>Are you
accusing me?</i>

392
00:23:49,087 --> 00:23:52,322
I'm just saying they
wouldn't act on their own.

393
00:23:52,357 --> 00:23:55,559
I am not in the habit
of picking my own pocket.

394
00:23:55,593 --> 00:23:57,327
I assume

395
00:23:57,362 --> 00:23:59,363

will be delayed.</i>

398
00:24:03,401 --> 00:24:05,268
There's too much

399
00:24:05,303 --> 00:24:07,337
We lay low for the time being.

400
00:24:07,372 --> 00:24:08,772
We lay low,

401
00:24:08,806 --> 00:24:11,308
and then we get the real story
from my man who survived.

402
00:24:11,342 --> 00:24:13,844
Your man is in custody.

403
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:17,180
He's innocent
until proven guilty.

404
00:24:17,215 --> 00:24:18,248
Correct?

405
00:24:18,282 --> 00:24:20,283
I'll get him the best lawyer,

we'll learn the truth.</i>

407
00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:24,588
Well, keep me apprised.

408
00:24:28,793 --> 00:24:31,695
Any time you've got that close
proximity to the spine,

409
00:24:31,729 --> 00:24:33,363
there's always going
to be cause for concern,

410
00:24:33,398 --> 00:24:35,032
but, as I say,

411
00:24:35,066 --> 00:24:36,700
it's really too soon to tell.

412
00:24:36,734 --> 00:24:39,603
He's out of surgery,
at least, which is--

413
00:24:39,637 --> 00:24:41,872
Out of surgery,
on his way to revery.

414
00:24:41,906 --> 00:24:43,473
All right.
Where's that?

415
00:24:43,508 --> 00:24:45,342
Unfortunately,
you can't see him just yet.

416
00:24:45,376 --> 00:24:47,644
We're gonna have to wait
for him to stabilize.

417
00:24:48,746 --> 00:24:49,946
How long will that take?

418
00:24:49,981 --> 00:24:51,748
I can't really say.

419
00:24:51,783 --> 00:24:53,450
Could be hours,

420
00:24:53,484 --> 00:24:56,453
but we'll let you know just
as soon as you could see him.

421
00:24:58,056 --> 00:24:59,089
Thank you.

422
00:25:04,128 --> 00:25:08,231
Um, maybe we should get
you home for a couple hours?

423
00:25:08,266 --> 00:25:10,901
Get some rest?

424
00:25:10,935 --> 00:25:12,536

Well, is anyone else dying
to brush their teeth,

427

or is it just me?

428
00:25:28,586 --> 00:25:30,120
What if I ran over to the house

429
00:25:30,154 --> 00:25:31,555
and picked up a few things?

430
00:25:31,589 --> 00:25:34,357

00:25:34,392 --> 00:25:35,892

00:33:13,973 --> 00:33:15,674
I got candy bars.

547
00:33:17,243 --> 00:33:18,577
Oh, um--

548
00:33:20,012 --> 00:33:22,781
Is this what
you were asking for?

549
00:33:22,815 --> 00:33:24,983
Yeah.
Yeah?

550
00:33:25,017 --> 00:33:28,353
Yeah, I--
I skimmed through it.

551
00:33:28,387 --> 00:33:29,721
Looks interesting.

552
00:33:29,755 --> 00:33:30,922
Yeah.

553
00:33:30,957 --> 00:33:34,292
Uncle Hank gave it to me.

554
00:33:38,197 --> 00:33:39,831
What's it about?

555
00:33:42,034 --> 00:33:44,402
Pablo Escobar,

556
00:33:44,437 --> 00:33:46,905
this big drug guy in the '80s.

557
00:33:48,207 --> 00:33:51,142
Yeah. Yeah, I remember
seeing him on the news.

558
00:33:51,177 --> 00:33:56,314
Well, it's more about
the guys who investigated him

559
00:33:56,349 --> 00:33:59,017
and tried to bring him down.

560
00:33:59,051 --> 00:34:02,120
Some of them were DEA,
you know?

561
00:34:02,154 --> 00:34:07,559
Uncle Hank said that they
were worth learning about,

562
00:34:07,593 --> 00:34:10,862
that everybody knows
who Pablo Escobar is,

563
00:34:10,897 --> 00:34:13,832
but nobody knows about the guys
that brought him down.

564
00:34:16,168 --> 00:34:18,303
I guess I never thought
about it.

565
00:34:20,439 --> 00:34:21,606
[chuckles]

566
00:34:21,641 --> 00:34:25,477
He said that good guys

567
00:34:25,511 --> 00:34:27,779
never get ink
like the bad guys do.

568
00:34:35,154 --> 00:34:36,855
[chuckles]

569
00:34:36,889 --> 00:34:39,824
So he gave it to me.

570
00:34:39,859 --> 00:34:41,826
Figured I'd read it.

571
00:34:45,164 --> 00:34:46,731
[cell phone ringing]

572
00:34:56,242 --> 00:34:58,810
Uh, I-- I need to--

573
00:34:58,844 --> 00:35:00,779
I'll be right back, okay?

574
00:35:07,386 --> 00:35:10,155
No, I assure you.
We are hard at work.

575
00:35:10,189 --> 00:35:12,357
Absolutely.

576
00:35:12,391 --> 00:35:16,428
<i>[Gus] So I can expect delivery
by tomorrow as scheduled.</i>

577
00:35:16,462 --> 00:35:18,763
Well, uh--

578
00:35:18,798 --> 00:35:20,532
No. Unfortunately--

579
00:35:20,566 --> 00:35:24,336
<i>Unfortunately,
we're not going to be able</i>

580
00:35:24,370 --> 00:35:26,571
to keep our schedule this week.

581
00:35:26,605 --> 00:35:29,107
But not for lack of trying.

582
00:35:29,141 --> 00:35:31,242
Is there something
I should know?

583
00:35:31,277 --> 00:35:36,214
Well, to be completely
honest with you...

584
00:35:36,248 --> 00:35:38,783
Gale really screwed us up.

585
00:35:38,818 --> 00:35:40,652
I mean, not on purpose,
of course,

586
00:35:40,686 --> 00:35:42,988
but he just--
he set us way back,

587
00:35:43,022 --> 00:35:47,025
and we've been playing
catch-up ever since.

588
00:35:47,059 --> 00:35:51,062
<i>And I've had to be out
running errands</i>

589
00:35:51,097 --> 00:35:53,898
<i>and trying to keep us
on target.</i>

590
00:35:53,933 --> 00:35:56,634
Some of the equipment

591
00:35:56,669 --> 00:35:58,403
wasn't calibrated
correctly and--

592
00:35:58,437 --> 00:36:01,639
Well, it's just all
very technical and boring,

593
00:36:01,674 --> 00:36:04,876
but rest assured that--

594
00:36:04,910 --> 00:36:07,245
that we will
do whatever it takes.

595
00:36:07,279 --> 00:36:09,848
<i>It has my total attention.</i>

596
00:36:09,882 --> 00:36:12,083
<i>We'll cook through
the weekend if necessary.</i>

597
00:36:12,118 --> 00:36:16,454
We will have 400 pounds
for you by next week.

598
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:22,560
I have your word on that?

599
00:36:22,595 --> 00:36:23,895
You do.

600
00:36:23,929 --> 00:36:27,565
You have my word on that.

601
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:29,134
<i>Thank you for the update.</i>

602
00:36:56,562 --> 00:36:58,229
Any news?

603
00:36:58,264 --> 00:37:02,167
Nah, I'm just-- just wandering.

604
00:37:02,201 --> 00:37:04,202
How's everybody doing?

605
00:37:04,236 --> 00:37:07,872
Well, as well
as can be expected.

606
00:37:07,907 --> 00:37:11,142
It's this not knowing

607
00:37:11,177 --> 00:37:13,044
that's the hardest part,
I think.

608
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:17,582
Anything new on these guys?

609
00:37:17,616 --> 00:37:19,617
Who they are?
What they wanted?

610
00:37:19,652 --> 00:37:21,786
No, nothing yet,

611
00:37:21,821 --> 00:37:23,788
but we'll get it.

612
00:37:27,693 --> 00:37:29,160
Steve...

613
00:37:31,430 --> 00:37:33,364
Do you think
there could maybe be others?

614
00:37:35,568 --> 00:37:38,570
Buddy, nobody's getting
to Hank.

615
00:37:38,604 --> 00:37:41,005
That was their one shot,
and they blew it.

616
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:42,874
So, no.

617
00:37:44,376 --> 00:37:46,377
No way.

618
00:37:47,513 --> 00:37:48,880
Jesus.

619
00:37:48,914 --> 00:37:50,615
I'd love to walk in there

620
00:37:50,649 --> 00:37:52,617
and shoot that bastard
right in the head.

621
00:37:52,651 --> 00:37:54,052
Me, too.

622
00:37:59,358 --> 00:38:00,725
[cell phone rings]

623
00:38:02,361 --> 00:38:03,661
Yeah.

624
00:38:04,897 --> 00:38:06,264
Oh, yeah?

625
00:38:06,298 --> 00:38:09,000
Great. We'll be right down.

626
00:38:09,034 --> 00:38:10,635
Food's here.

627
00:38:10,669 --> 00:38:12,470
Hey, you like Pollos Hermanos?

628
00:38:15,674 --> 00:38:17,408
Uh, on occasion, yeah.

629
00:38:17,443 --> 00:38:19,310
Owner's a big booster
for the DEA.

630
00:38:19,345 --> 00:38:22,580
He heard what happened.
He's going to feed every cop in the building.

631
00:38:24,016 --> 00:38:25,783
That's-- That's wonderful.

632
00:38:25,818 --> 00:38:28,553
Yeah, and apparently he's
bringing it by personally.

633
00:38:32,024 --> 00:38:33,391
[elevator bell dings]

634
00:38:36,109 --> 00:38:37,810
[Marie] I don't even
know what to say.

635
00:38:37,844 --> 00:38:38,877
[Skyler]
That's an incredible--

636
00:38:38,912 --> 00:38:40,179
Good, huh?

637
00:38:40,213 --> 00:38:41,647
Delicious.

638
00:38:41,681 --> 00:38:44,850
[Marie] That's so generous of you.
Thank you very much.

639
00:38:44,884 --> 00:38:46,351
[Skyler] Yes, thank you.

640
00:38:46,386 --> 00:38:47,519
Guys, did you hear that?

641
00:38:47,554 --> 00:38:50,222
Mr. Fring is offering
a $10,000 reward

642
00:38:50,256 --> 00:38:52,224
on any information
about the case.

643
00:38:52,258 --> 00:38:55,828
Well, that's--
that's wonderful.

644
00:38:55,862 --> 00:38:58,397
Wow. Thank you, Mr. Fring.

645
00:38:58,431 --> 00:39:00,232
You're very welcome.

646
00:39:00,266 --> 00:39:02,301
Men like your husband
are the thin blue line

647
00:39:02,335 --> 00:39:04,436
between us and these animals.

648
00:39:04,471 --> 00:39:06,572
I only wish I could do more.

649
00:39:11,411 --> 00:39:13,645
Well, we do appreciate
your support.

650
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:16,181
This reward could turn
the tide here.

651
00:39:16,216 --> 00:39:18,884
It'll really help.

652
00:39:18,918 --> 00:39:22,354
Again, I can't express
how sorry I am.

653
00:39:22,388 --> 00:39:24,656
As it happens,
I actually met Agent Schrader.

654
00:39:24,691 --> 00:39:26,792
[Marie] Really?

655
00:39:26,826 --> 00:39:30,028
Our fun run,
a couple months ago.

656
00:39:30,063 --> 00:39:33,432
Mr. Fring
was one of our sponsors.

657
00:39:33,466 --> 00:39:37,269
I talked for a few minutes
with your husband.

658
00:39:37,303 --> 00:39:41,006
As a matter of fact,
Mr. White, your name came up.

659
00:39:43,910 --> 00:39:46,778
Really? Huh.

660
00:39:46,813 --> 00:39:50,315
Yeah, there happened to be
a collection jar out for you,

661
00:39:50,350 --> 00:39:53,151
and we spoke briefly
about your health concerns.

662
00:39:53,186 --> 00:39:55,621
I hope that there's been
good news.

663
00:39:57,457 --> 00:40:01,493
Uh, yeah, things
have improved, yes.

664
00:40:01,528 --> 00:40:03,795
That's wonderful to hear.

665
00:40:03,830 --> 00:40:07,366
It was clear to me
how deeply he cares for you.

666
00:40:09,469 --> 00:40:13,572
Well, I've taken up
enough of your time.

667
00:40:13,606 --> 00:40:17,976
Um... thank you
again very much.

668
00:40:18,011 --> 00:40:19,478
It was a great pleasure
to meet you.

669
00:40:19,512 --> 00:40:21,647
Thank you. 
[Walter, Jr.] Yes, thank you.

670
00:40:23,816 --> 00:40:26,084
Let me walk you out.
Oh-- Oh, no, it's not necessary.

671
00:40:32,759 --> 00:40:36,028
You know,
I didn't say thank you.

672
00:40:36,062 --> 00:40:37,162
I'll walk him out.

673
00:40:37,196 --> 00:40:38,664
I'll be right back.

674
00:40:40,333 --> 00:40:43,635
Hi. How are you?
Good to see you.

675
00:40:43,670 --> 00:40:45,304
Enjoying the chicken?

676
00:40:45,338 --> 00:40:47,339
Good. Good-- Hey.

677
00:40:47,373 --> 00:40:49,608
Oh, you're very welcome.
My pleasure.

678
00:40:49,642 --> 00:40:51,243
My pleasure, yeah.
Excuse me.

679
00:40:51,277 --> 00:40:52,844
Thank you. Thank you.

680
00:40:52,879 --> 00:40:54,413
It's good chicken, huh?
Yeah.

681
00:40:54,447 --> 00:40:55,714
Good.
Mr. Fring.

682
00:40:55,748 --> 00:40:57,282
May I--
Mr. White.

683
00:40:57,317 --> 00:40:59,084
I just wanted
to thank you again.

684
00:40:59,118 --> 00:41:00,586
Oh, it's my pleasure.

685
00:41:00,620 --> 00:41:02,955
Uh, may I--
may I speak with you?

686
00:41:02,989 --> 00:41:04,323
Just a moment?

687
00:41:09,028 --> 00:41:11,129
You knew.

688
00:41:11,164 --> 00:41:13,699
You knew my brother-in-law
was with the DEA.

689
00:41:15,068 --> 00:41:18,070
I investigate everyone
with whom I do business.

690
00:41:18,104 --> 00:41:20,939
What careful man wouldn't?

691
00:41:20,974 --> 00:41:23,875
He is not a problem for us,

692
00:41:23,910 --> 00:41:25,944
for our business.

693
00:41:29,115 --> 00:41:32,150
Your being here is--

694
00:41:32,185 --> 00:41:35,754
Is this some sort of message?

695
00:41:35,788 --> 00:41:38,156
I'm supporting my community.

696
00:41:38,191 --> 00:41:40,993
I hide in plain sight,
same as you.

697
00:41:41,027 --> 00:41:42,227
Are we done?

698
00:41:42,261 --> 00:41:43,261
No-- No, listen, I--

699
00:41:43,296 --> 00:41:44,630
This attack
on my brother-in-law--

700
00:41:44,664 --> 00:41:46,765
I don't--
I don't understand it.

701
00:41:46,799 --> 00:41:48,667
I don't know what it means.

702
00:41:48,701 --> 00:41:52,938
Please, if you have
some knowledge

703
00:41:52,972 --> 00:41:54,506
that you could share with me.

704
00:42:00,046 --> 00:42:02,648
I fear for my family.

705
00:42:02,682 --> 00:42:03,782
I'm sure they'll be fine.

706
00:42:03,816 --> 00:42:06,351
I am told the assassin
that survived

707
00:42:06,386 --> 00:42:07,853
is gravely injured.

708
00:42:07,887 --> 00:42:09,655
It's doubtful he'll live.

709
00:42:13,259 --> 00:42:15,594
Now thank me and shake my hand.

710
00:42:19,565 --> 00:42:22,501
Uh-- thank you.
Thank you again.

711
00:42:22,535 --> 00:42:24,536
You're quite welcome,
Mr. White.

712
00:42:35,214 --> 00:42:38,216
What's going on?

713
00:42:38,251 --> 00:42:40,018
What's happening?

714
00:42:40,053 --> 00:42:41,053
[Woman]
Starting chest compressions.

715
00:42:41,087 --> 00:42:42,788
One, two, three, four.

716
00:42:42,822 --> 00:42:44,656
[monitor flatlines]
[alarm beeping]

717
00:42:44,691 --> 00:42:45,724
One, two, three--
[Man] Defib?

718
00:42:45,758 --> 00:42:47,259
No reason.
Patient is--

719
00:42:47,293 --> 00:42:49,261
Continuing chest compressions.

720
00:42:49,295 --> 00:42:51,029
One, two, three, four.

721
00:42:51,064 --> 00:42:53,398
Give me a liter of saline wide open.
I can't get a pulse back.

722
00:42:53,433 --> 00:42:55,100
One, two, three, four.

723
00:42:55,134 --> 00:42:56,635
[Man] Still nothing.
One, two, three--

724
00:42:56,669 --> 00:42:58,637
All right.
Stopping compressions.

725
00:42:58,671 --> 00:42:59,905
Time.

726
00:42:59,939 --> 00:43:01,239
8:43.

727
00:43:01,274 --> 00:43:03,141
Time of death. 20:43.

728
00:43:03,176 --> 00:43:05,444
[steadbeep]

729
00:43:05,478 --> 00:43:07,546
Burn in hell,
you piece of shit.

730
00:43:22,528 --> 00:43:23,995
[sizzling]

731
00:43:25,565 --> 00:43:27,899
[cell phone vibrating]

732
00:43:34,340 --> 00:43:36,074
Yes? Juan?

733
00:43:36,109 --> 00:43:38,143
<i>[Bolsa]
I assume you heard the news.</i>

734
00:43:38,177 --> 00:43:41,046
Your man died.
I heard.

735
00:43:41,080 --> 00:43:42,180
It's unfortunate.

736
00:43:42,215 --> 00:43:43,548
<i>Yeah, "unfortunate,"</i>

737
00:43:43,583 --> 00:43:46,618
<i>and meanwhile I have Federales
surrounding my house.</i>

738
00:43:46,652 --> 00:43:48,954
You know what I think, Gustavo?

739
00:43:48,988 --> 00:43:50,455
I think you're behind all this.

740
00:43:50,490 --> 00:43:54,259
Why would I do this?
How would it serve me?

741
00:43:54,293 --> 00:43:56,228
<i>That's the part I'm trying
to figure out.</i>

742
00:43:56,262 --> 00:43:59,364
Go off on your own, maybe.

743
00:43:59,398 --> 00:44:00,966
Would you actually think
that would work?

744
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:04,035
<i>Juan, you sound like
you're under a lot of stress.</i>

745
00:44:04,070 --> 00:44:05,403
<i>Maybe you should call me back</i>

746
00:44:05,438 --> 00:44:06,872
when you're seeing things
more clearly.

747
00:44:06,906 --> 00:44:08,740
I see things clear enough.

748
00:44:08,775 --> 00:44:12,444
One DEA gets shot.
All of Washington starts barking.

749
00:44:12,478 --> 00:44:14,646
The D.F. suddenly
has to put on a big show,

750
00:44:14,680 --> 00:44:17,649
<i>and I wind up with Federales
in my rose bushes.</i>

751
00:44:17,683 --> 00:44:19,451
<i>But just for a while.</i>

752
00:44:19,485 --> 00:44:23,922
Appearances, politics.

753
00:44:23,956 --> 00:44:25,991
<i>Are you still there,
Gustavo?</i>

754
00:44:26,025 --> 00:44:29,127
Yes, I'm here.

755
00:44:29,162 --> 00:44:31,830
<i>I'll weather this.
I always do.</i>

756
00:44:31,864 --> 00:44:33,732
My brother's a police chief.

757
00:44:33,766 --> 00:44:36,334
I got connections.
They'll get me through.

758
00:44:36,369 --> 00:44:38,770
And when I get proof

759
00:44:38,805 --> 00:44:42,174
and the others find out
what you've done,

760
00:44:42,208 --> 00:44:45,043
maybe we come pay you a visit.

761
00:44:45,077 --> 00:44:47,345
<i>Maybe we c--
[glass pops, shatters]</i>

762
00:44:47,380 --> 00:44:48,613
<i>[speaks Spanish]</i>

763
00:44:48,648 --> 00:44:49,981
[Men shouting]

764
00:44:50,016 --> 00:44:51,249
[speaks Spanish]

765
00:44:51,284 --> 00:44:52,818
[shouts in Spanish]

766
00:44:52,852 --> 00:44:54,753
[gunfire]

767
00:44:54,787 --> 00:44:56,688
[speaks Spanish]

768
00:44:56,722 --> 00:44:58,056

<i>[gunfire]</i>

770
00:45:06,199 --> 00:45:07,999
<i>[gunfire]</i>

771
00:45:34,660 --> 00:45:36,061
Skyler. Skyler.

772
00:45:36,095 --> 00:45:37,863
Marie. Marie.

773
00:45:39,398 --> 00:45:41,967
Oh, how is he?
Tell me something good.

774
00:45:42,001 --> 00:45:44,970
I think he's stable enough now
for you to go see him briefly.

775
00:45:45,004 --> 00:45:47,739
I'm sorry, but I'm afraid
it's immediately family only.

776
00:45:47,773 --> 00:45:49,007
We're all family.

777
00:45:49,041 --> 00:45:50,308
I understand,

778
00:45:50,343 --> 00:45:52,644
but we have a certain protocol
here that we need--

779
00:45:52,678 --> 00:45:55,280
We're all family.

780
00:46:02,021 --> 00:46:07,325

[respirator hissing]
