It's so gross.

Major League and all,

26
00:03:03,504 --> 00:03:07,005
we should have equipment

And water boys.
You know?

Yo, Gatorade me, bitch.

29
00:03:19,612 --> 00:03:22,080
Get us a couple flunkies

00:03:40,894 --> 00:03:42,494
I don't understand.

35
00:03:42,528 --> 00:03:43,828
What?

36
00:03:43,863 --> 00:03:45,730
These numbers,
they just don't add up.

37
00:03:45,764 --> 00:03:48,432
Told you.
Dude's totally boning us.

38
00:03:48,466 --> 00:03:51,300
No, it's not that.

39
00:03:51,335 --> 00:03:52,935
It's our output.
We're off.

40
00:03:52,969 --> 00:03:56,337
We're .14% off.

41
00:03:56,371 --> 00:04:00,673
Point one-four,
that's what, like--

42
00:04:00,707 --> 00:04:02,140
What does that mean?

43
00:04:02,175 --> 00:04:05,976
It means we should be netting
more than we're netting.

44
00:04:08,012 --> 00:04:11,114
So how far off are we?

45
00:04:11,148 --> 00:04:12,815
It's not negligible.

quarter to a half a pound shy.

That's weird.

49
00:04:24,424 --> 00:04:26,992
What about spillage?

00:04:27,026 --> 00:04:28,327
Spillage?

51
00:04:28,361 --> 00:04:30,662
Yeah, you know, like,
just stuff gets spilled.

52
00:04:30,696 --> 00:04:32,731
Nothing gets spilled.

53
00:04:32,765 --> 00:04:34,165
A little maybe.

54
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:35,933
Nothing gets spilled.

55
00:04:35,968 --> 00:04:39,437
What about evaporation?

56
00:04:39,472 --> 00:04:40,805
It wouldn't account
for this much.

57
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:43,041
The materials aren't out
that long.

58
00:04:43,075 --> 00:04:44,909
What about the other one?

59
00:04:44,943 --> 00:04:47,912
The drops, like on--

60
00:04:47,946 --> 00:04:50,147

No.

64
00:04:55,988 --> 00:04:58,858
What about the crap
that gets left behind,

65
00:04:58,893 --> 00:05:01,958
you know, all the gunk
we scrape out of the vats?

66
00:05:01,992 --> 00:05:05,460
I add up, like, a gallon each.

67
00:05:05,494 --> 00:05:08,062

Yeah. Vestiges.

Yeah-- Yeah, why?

00:05:37,687 --> 00:05:39,388
Nothing.

Positive pressure.

128
00:11:21,834 --> 00:11:24,235

00:11:26,938 --> 00:11:28,905
Well, just move your jaw around.
Move it around.

00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:30,540
I am moving it around.
It's not working.

132

W-W-What positive?
Positive what?

136
00:11:38,114 --> 00:11:41,048
Pressure. I've turned
the ventilation up

137
00:11:41,083 --> 00:11:43,584
to keep the outside out.

138
00:11:43,619 --> 00:11:46,953
There's been a contamination.

139
00:11:46,987 --> 00:11:49,290
Wait. What?

140
00:11:49,324 --> 00:11:51,458
Whoa whoa whoa, hey, hold up.

141
00:11:51,492 --> 00:11:53,794
Something got into the lab.

142
00:11:53,828 --> 00:11:56,430
So what do we do?

143
00:11:56,465 --> 00:11:57,765
I mean, do we--

144
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:01,235
Wait. Wait. I mean, shouldn't
we be wearing masks?

145
00:12:01,270 --> 00:12:04,507
No, no, it's not that--
that kind of contaminant.

146
00:12:04,541 --> 00:12:07,343
So it's, like, not dangerous?

147
00:12:07,377 --> 00:12:11,013
Mr. White,
talk to me here.

148
00:12:11,047 --> 00:12:14,249
Not to us particularly. No.

149
00:12:16,085 --> 00:12:17,385
What the hell is that?

150
00:12:17,419 --> 00:12:21,389
This is, uh-- I made it.

151
00:12:23,691 --> 00:12:27,726
So exactly what kind of contaminant
are we dealing with here?

152
00:12:33,030 --> 00:12:34,732
A fly.

153
00:12:36,539 --> 00:12:38,241
What do you mean?

154
00:12:38,275 --> 00:12:41,043
A fly, like--
like what do you mean?

155
00:12:41,077 --> 00:12:44,145
I mean a fly, a house fly.

156
00:12:47,549 --> 00:12:49,483
Like, uh, one fly?

157
00:12:49,517 --> 00:12:53,286
Singular?
What did it do?

158
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:55,621
It got into the lab,
and I'm trying to get it out.

159
00:12:55,656 --> 00:12:57,323
Okay? Understand?

160
00:12:57,357 --> 00:12:59,691
No, man, not really.

161
00:12:59,725 --> 00:13:03,894
I can't say that I'm
really following you here.

162
00:13:03,928 --> 00:13:06,796
Dude, you scared
the shit out of me.

163
00:13:06,830 --> 00:13:09,032
I mean, when you say
it's contamination,

164
00:13:09,066 --> 00:13:12,037
I mean, I'm thinking, like
an Ebola leak or something.

165
00:13:12,071 --> 00:13:13,471
Ebola?

166
00:13:13,505 --> 00:13:15,839
Yeah, it's a disease
on The Discovery Channel,

167
00:13:15,874 --> 00:13:16,940
where all your intestines

168
00:13:16,975 --> 00:13:18,909
sort of just slip
right out of your butt.

169
00:13:18,943 --> 00:13:21,377
Thank you. I know wt Ebola is.
Uh-huh.

170
00:13:21,412 --> 00:13:24,080
Now, tell me.
What would a West-African virus

171
00:13:24,114 --> 00:13:25,648
be doing in our lab?

172
00:13:25,683 --> 00:13:27,150
Hmm?

173
00:13:27,184 --> 00:13:30,019
So you're chasing around a fly,

174
00:13:30,054 --> 00:13:34,024
and in your world
I'm the idiot.

175
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:37,728
Jesse, listen.

176
00:13:37,762 --> 00:13:40,364
This fly-- any fly--

177
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:41,931
cannot be in our lab.

178
00:13:41,966 --> 00:13:43,398
It's-- It's a problem.

179
00:13:43,433 --> 00:13:44,864
It's a contamination,

180
00:13:44,898 --> 00:13:47,198
and that is in no way
a misuse of the word.

181
00:13:47,232 --> 00:13:48,332
Okay?

182
00:13:48,367 --> 00:13:51,969
So in terms of keeping
our cook clean

183
00:13:52,003 --> 00:13:54,237
and our product unadulterated,

184
00:13:54,272 --> 00:13:56,806
we need to take this.

185
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:58,340
Now do you understand?

186
00:14:01,843 --> 00:14:03,577
So is that your fly saber?

187
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:07,784
This is a swatter.

188
00:14:07,818 --> 00:14:10,053
It happens to work quite well,
thank you.

189
00:14:10,088 --> 00:14:14,057
Uh-huh. Hey,
what happened to your head?

190
00:14:14,092 --> 00:14:15,859
Nothing. I'm fine.

191
00:14:15,893 --> 00:14:18,794
You didn't hit it,
like really-- really hard?

192
00:14:18,828 --> 00:14:20,962
My head is not the problem,
Jesse.

193
00:14:20,997 --> 00:14:23,198
The fly is the problem.

194
00:14:24,567 --> 00:14:28,203
You didn't happen to maybe...

195
00:14:28,237 --> 00:14:31,306
try our product, did you?

196
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:35,840
Jess I know this seems
unusual to you, a layman.

197
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:38,643
A fly-- I get it--
seems insignificant, right?

198
00:14:38,677 --> 00:14:39,977
But trust me.

199
00:14:40,012 --> 00:14:42,446
In a highly controlled
environment such as this--

200
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:46,150
[fly buzzes]

201
00:14:46,184 --> 00:14:47,985
...anyollutant--

202
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:49,954
[buzzing]

203
00:14:49,988 --> 00:14:52,655
...no matter how small--

204
00:14:55,359 --> 00:14:57,260
...could completely--

205
00:15:11,539 --> 00:15:12,873
Hello.

206
00:15:15,543 --> 00:15:16,710
What?

207
00:15:20,214 --> 00:15:23,215
Were you here all night?

208
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:24,984
Have you even slept?

209
00:15:25,018 --> 00:15:28,020
No. Jesse, look.
I'm fine. Okay

210
00:15:28,054 --> 00:15:29,120
Will you just please focus--

211
00:15:29,155 --> 00:15:32,324
[beeping]

212
00:15:35,561 --> 00:15:38,096
Okay, look. We're running late,
so let's just get started.

213
00:15:38,131 --> 00:15:40,632
Shall we? The sooner we do
it, the sooner we're done.

214
00:15:40,666 --> 00:15:43,735
Frickin' finally.

215
00:15:43,769 --> 00:15:45,470
[grunts]

216
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:48,340
Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa.

217
00:15:48,374 --> 00:15:50,108
What are you doing?

218
00:15:50,142 --> 00:15:52,410
It's time to alkaline.

219
00:15:52,444 --> 00:15:55,379
Have you not heard
a word I said?

220
00:15:55,414 --> 00:15:58,783
No cooking until this fly
is dealt with.

221
00:15:58,817 --> 00:16:01,519
Have I been speaking to self?

222
00:16:01,553 --> 00:16:03,988
The mer went off, yo.

223
00:16:04,022 --> 00:16:06,824
How long is this batch going to be good for?
An hour? Two?

224
00:16:06,859 --> 00:16:09,126
The batch will be good
for nothing

225
00:16:09,161 --> 00:16:11,295
if we don't clear
the contaminant.

226
00:16:11,330 --> 00:16:13,264
Clear the contaminant?

227
00:16:13,298 --> 00:16:15,098
We're making meth here,

228
00:16:15,133 --> 00:16:16,533
not space shuttles.

229
00:16:16,567 --> 00:16:19,802
We're making nothing
until we catch this fly.

230
00:16:19,837 --> 00:16:21,070
What fly?

231
00:16:21,104 --> 00:16:24,274
Where the hell is this fly?

232
00:16:24,307 --> 00:16:25,774
Not like I've even seen
the thing.

233
00:16:25,808 --> 00:16:28,576
Maybe your positive pressure blew
it out the door or something.

234
00:16:28,611 --> 00:16:32,147
No, no. It is here.
It is around. Okay?

235
00:16:32,181 --> 00:16:34,683
He's around,
and am not going to expose

236
00:16:34,718 --> 00:16:37,987
this batch to the open air
and contamination.

237
00:16:38,021 --> 00:16:41,523
Now, you can leave me to deal with
this myself, or you can help me,

238
00:16:41,558 --> 00:16:42,690
but you are right.

239
00:16:42,725 --> 00:16:44,158
We are running out of time,

240
00:16:44,192 --> 00:16:45,990
so I need your answer
right now.

241
00:16:53,797 --> 00:16:55,031
Okay.

242
00:17:04,806 --> 00:17:08,875
Hey, tick-tock. Yo.

243
00:17:15,882 --> 00:17:19,518
Look, I like making cherry
products, but let's keep it real.

244
00:17:19,552 --> 00:17:21,786
All right, we make poison

245
00:17:21,821 --> 00:17:24,021
for people who don't care.

246
00:17:24,056 --> 00:17:26,923
We probably have the most
UN-picky customers in the world.

247
00:17:26,957 --> 00:17:29,558
No, no, no, no, no.
No rationalizing.

248
00:17:29,592 --> 00:17:32,060
We'll find it any minute now.
Don't give up.

249
00:17:44,941 --> 00:17:46,608
Did you--

250
00:17:46,643 --> 00:17:50,646
Did you know that there's an
acceptable level of rat turds

251
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:54,549
that can go into candy bars?

252
00:17:54,584 --> 00:17:57,552
That's the government, Jack.

253
00:17:57,587 --> 00:17:59,988
Even the government

254
00:18:00,023 --> 00:18:03,125
doesn't care that much
about quality.

255
00:18:04,727 --> 00:18:10,565
You know what is okay to put
in hotdogs? Huh?

256
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:14,069
Pig lips and assholes,

257
00:18:14,103 --> 00:18:17,505
but I say, hey,
have at it, bastard,

258
00:18:17,540 --> 00:18:21,009
because I love hotdogs,

259
00:18:21,043 --> 00:18:23,712
and, you know,
see what I'm--

260
00:18:23,746 --> 00:18:24,979
What are you doing?

261
00:18:25,014 --> 00:18:26,948
Oh. Hey.

262
00:18:29,585 --> 00:18:31,687
Look, let me just top it off,

263
00:18:31,722 --> 00:18:33,389
all right, really quick.

264
00:18:33,424 --> 00:18:35,725
A little sodium hydroxide,
shut the lid,

265
00:18:35,759 --> 00:18:37,325
No harm done.
Then we're golden.

266
00:18:42,697 --> 00:18:45,599
It stays closed.
That's an order.

267
00:18:45,633 --> 00:18:47,967
You can't order shit,
Adolf.

268
00:18:48,002 --> 00:18:51,672
We're 50-50 partners.
Remember?

269
00:18:56,377 --> 00:18:58,445
Ow!

270
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:01,182
God, what is your problem,
bro?

271
00:19:03,118 --> 00:19:04,751
Freakin' psycho.

272
00:19:04,786 --> 00:19:06,053
[groans]

273
00:19:06,087 --> 00:19:07,486
Jesse.

274
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:10,288
Oh, God, it, like, hit bone.

275
00:19:10,322 --> 00:19:11,655
Jesse.

276
00:19:11,690 --> 00:19:13,424
Jesse.

277
00:19:16,727 --> 00:19:18,228
You see it, right?

278
00:19:19,663 --> 00:19:21,097
You see it?

279
00:19:21,131 --> 00:19:23,399
Yeah.

280
00:19:25,535 --> 00:19:27,103
Get it.

281
00:19:29,072 --> 00:19:31,473
You want me to get it?

282
00:19:31,508 --> 00:19:33,242
Yes.

283
00:19:35,312 --> 00:19:38,613
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Slow.

284
00:19:38,648 --> 00:19:40,682
Move slowly.

285
00:19:40,716 --> 00:19:41,883
I know.

286
00:19:41,917 --> 00:19:43,884
I'm moving slowly, yeah.

287
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:47,087
Absolutely. I'm just going
to need your swatter thing.

288
00:19:50,758 --> 00:19:53,359
Yeah. Come on.

289
00:19:53,393 --> 00:19:56,095
Oh, yeah.
It's okay, come on.

290
00:19:59,432 --> 00:20:00,598
Come on.
Make it count.

291
00:20:00,633 --> 00:20:01,799
Yeah, no, no,
I'm gonna--

292
00:20:01,834 --> 00:20:04,568
I'm going to make it count,
all right.

293
00:20:04,603 --> 00:20:07,071
Ok. Now.

294
00:20:07,105 --> 00:20:08,605
On three.

295
00:20:08,639 --> 00:20:10,206
Okay.

296
00:20:10,241 --> 00:20:11,508

297
00:20:11,542 --> 00:20:13,276
Ow!

298
00:20:13,310 --> 00:20:16,377
Yeah. You like that?

299
00:20:16,411 --> 00:20:17,778
Hurts, huh?

00:20:21,249 --> 00:20:22,582
Did you get it?

302
00:20:22,616 --> 00:20:25,351
I think so, yeah.
Where is it?

303
00:20:25,385 --> 00:20:27,386
I don't know.
It doesn't matter.

304
00:20:27,420 --> 00:20:29,387
Who cares?
I got it.

305
00:20:29,422 --> 00:20:31,055
Oh, Jesus, seriously?

306
00:20:31,090 --> 00:20:33,491
Where is it?

307
00:20:33,525 --> 00:20:37,061
It's, uh, right there.
Look.

308
00:20:37,095 --> 00:20:40,498
Look. See?
I told you I got it.

309
00:20:50,011 --> 00:20:51,711
This is a raisin.

310
00:20:53,114 --> 00:20:55,415
Look, I definitely got it, man.

311
00:20:55,449 --> 00:20:57,017
All right--
[fly buzzing]

312
00:20:58,519 --> 00:21:00,954
Oh, man.

313
00:21:00,988 --> 00:21:03,289
He's got some skills, yo.

314
00:21:03,324 --> 00:21:05,358
I'll give him that.

315
00:21:05,393 --> 00:21:09,430
Look...

316
00:21:09,464 --> 00:21:13,835
I feel like I'm running out of
ways to explain this to you,

317
00:21:13,869 --> 00:21:17,472
but once more I shall try.

318
00:21:17,507 --> 00:21:21,477
This fly is a major problem
for us.

319
00:21:21,512 --> 00:21:24,147
It will ruin our batch.

320
00:21:24,181 --> 00:21:26,183
Now, we need to destroy it

321
00:21:26,217 --> 00:21:30,321
and every trace of it
so we can cook.

322
00:21:30,355 --> 00:21:32,189
Failing that...

323
00:21:34,793 --> 00:21:36,660
we're dead.

324
00:21:40,198 --> 00:21:42,734
There is no more room
for error.

325
00:21:44,737 --> 00:21:46,438
Not with these people.

326
00:21:49,475 --> 00:21:52,277
All right,
how about we go get some air?

327
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:55,214
Get some air?

328
00:21:55,249 --> 00:21:59,118
Your answer to "We're sliding
head-first into a massive crap--"

Mister-- Mr. White,

330
00:22:00,855 --> 00:22:04,158
I understand that
the fly is a serious thing.

331
00:22:04,192 --> 00:22:05,660
Now, all right?
I'm on board.

332
00:22:05,694 --> 00:22:09,030
I'm just saying maybe
if we went and got some air,

333
00:22:09,064 --> 00:22:10,998
it would help us
come up with a plan

334
00:22:11,032 --> 00:22:12,563
on how to catch it.

335
00:22:12,597 --> 00:22:14,196
Then come back down here

336
00:22:14,230 --> 00:22:16,396
and subtract his ass.

Oh, wait,
do you have your keys?

Yeah.
You're sure?

341
00:22:40,976 --> 00:22:42,877
Last thing we need
is to get locked out.

342
00:22:42,911 --> 00:22:45,179
Yeah.

343
00:22:45,214 --> 00:22:46,614
Hey!

344
00:22:46,648 --> 00:22:48,883
If you're not going to help me,
stay out of my way!

Hey!

an ax I can use?

No, no...

No, no-- Look, we're trying
to decontaminate.

364
00:24:41,473 --> 00:24:44,340
You don't decontaminate
by contaminating further.

What the hell is all this?

366
00:24:48,011 --> 00:24:51,046
Here, how about this?

367
00:24:51,081 --> 00:24:52,948
"Nontoxic glue strips."

368
00:24:52,983 --> 00:24:55,983
Yeah, baby,
it's got pheromones.

369
00:24:56,018 --> 00:24:58,151
I got a buttload.
We hang them up all over the place.

370
00:24:58,186 --> 00:25:00,019
It won't be able to resist.

371
00:25:06,059 --> 00:25:07,960
I sure hope we have enough.

372
00:25:07,994 --> 00:25:11,663
[Jesse] I'm going to go out
on a limb and say yeah.

373
00:25:13,366 --> 00:25:14,833
[Walt] Do you see him?

374
00:25:17,036 --> 00:25:19,639
How long do you think
you've been awake?

375
00:25:19,673 --> 00:25:21,674
Why do you keep asking me that?

376
00:25:21,708 --> 00:25:24,510
Just figure you could use
some coffee, is all.

377
00:25:24,544 --> 00:25:26,479
I know I could.

378
00:25:26,513 --> 00:25:28,580
How about it?

379
00:25:30,149 --> 00:25:31,616
Yeah.

380
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:35,754
You take cream and sugar?

381
00:25:35,788 --> 00:25:36,955
Black is fine.

382
00:25:49,868 --> 00:25:52,637
Why don't you
just leave him be?

383
00:25:52,671 --> 00:25:55,040
Let the traps do the work.

384
00:25:55,074 --> 00:25:58,311
These pheromones
are supposed to kick ass.

385
00:26:00,079 --> 00:26:04,216
I bet we catch this mo-fo
any second.

386
00:26:17,396 --> 00:26:19,930
Thank you.

387
00:26:19,965 --> 00:26:23,800
You ever have, like,
a wild animal

388
00:26:23,835 --> 00:26:25,535
trapped our house?

389
00:26:29,641 --> 00:26:32,509
Not that I can recall, no.

390
00:26:32,543 --> 00:26:35,846
We did, this one time,

391
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:37,714
back when it was
my aunt's house,

392
00:26:37,749 --> 00:26:42,019
back before she died of cancer.

393
00:26:42,053 --> 00:26:46,822
Possum.
Big, freaky-looking bitch.

394
00:26:46,857 --> 00:26:50,859
Hey, since when did they change it to "opossum"?
What's up with that?

395
00:26:50,894 --> 00:26:52,228
I mean, when I was coming up,

396
00:26:52,262 --> 00:26:54,230
it was just "possum."

397
00:26:54,264 --> 00:26:58,103
"Opossum" makes it sound
like he's Irish or something.

398
00:26:58,138 --> 00:27:01,373
Why they gotta go changing
everything?

399
00:27:01,407 --> 00:27:04,275
Whatever. They're just
big rats anyways,

400
00:27:04,309 --> 00:27:05,776
giant pink-tailed rats

401
00:27:05,810 --> 00:27:08,311
with their pink rat faces,

402
00:27:08,346 --> 00:27:10,180
totally freaky,

403
00:27:10,214 --> 00:27:12,482
like alien rats.

404
00:27:15,086 --> 00:27:18,422
Actually, it's not so much
that he got trapped,

405
00:27:18,456 --> 00:27:22,793
but he was living there
under the house.

406
00:27:22,827 --> 00:27:26,163
You could hear him going from,
like, room to room,

407
00:27:26,197 --> 00:27:29,399
always scurrying around.

408
00:27:29,434 --> 00:27:31,568
Sometimes I'd see him
outside at night,

409
00:27:31,602 --> 00:27:34,838
and he would just,
you know, freeze.

410
00:27:34,872 --> 00:27:38,375
And it's like you're not
looking right at it. Right?

411
00:27:38,409 --> 00:27:41,344
I mean, it thinks
it's fooling you.

412
00:27:41,378 --> 00:27:45,081
That's what they do.
They play dead or whatever.

413
00:27:45,115 --> 00:27:47,417
It's just so lame.

414
00:27:47,451 --> 00:27:52,888
Is there a discernible point
to this story,

415
00:27:52,923 --> 00:27:55,757
a point that
you'll be arriving at

416
00:27:55,792 --> 00:27:59,060
sometime in the near future?

417
00:27:59,095 --> 00:28:02,998
It was just a total bitch
to get out. It took forever.

418
00:28:03,032 --> 00:28:07,602
A guy came,
set all these traps and all,

419
00:28:07,636 --> 00:28:09,771
and he finally got it,

420
00:28:09,805 --> 00:28:11,639
but my aunt,

421
00:28:11,673 --> 00:28:15,309
she didn't believe it.

422
00:28:15,344 --> 00:28:19,647
She kept insisting she
could still hear the thing.

423
00:28:19,681 --> 00:28:22,850
I mean, you could not
tell her any different.

424
00:28:22,884 --> 00:28:24,852
She started keeping
an old umbrella

425
00:28:24,886 --> 00:28:27,287
by her chair.

426
00:28:27,322 --> 00:28:30,357
Man, she would just bang
on the floor and yell at it,

427
00:28:30,391 --> 00:28:33,093
even gave it a name.

428
00:28:33,127 --> 00:28:35,195
It was, uh, Sc--

429
00:28:35,229 --> 00:28:37,097
Scrabble.

430
00:28:37,131 --> 00:28:38,498
Yeah, that was it.

431
00:28:38,533 --> 00:28:41,334
"Scrabble, just knock it off."
Bang, bang, bang.

432
00:28:44,605 --> 00:28:47,974
She got like that
toward the end.

433
00:28:49,911 --> 00:28:52,545
Got obsessive about stuff,

434
00:28:52,580 --> 00:28:56,583
just got mad about stuff.

435
00:28:56,617 --> 00:28:59,485
We didn't know what was up.

436
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:03,089
It wasn't like her
to be that way.

437
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:09,495
But it turned out
that the--

438
00:29:09,530 --> 00:29:12,899
the cancer had spread
to her brain,

439
00:29:12,933 --> 00:29:15,935
and that was why.

440
00:29:15,969 --> 00:29:18,771
It metastasized.

441
00:29:21,175 --> 00:29:25,745
But it was good that that was when
we decided to take her to the doctor

442
00:29:25,779 --> 00:29:30,783
because then we knew
what was up

443
00:29:30,818 --> 00:29:33,653
and got her some treatment

444
00:29:33,687 --> 00:29:36,289
and meds so she wasn't
stressing all the time.

445
00:29:40,894 --> 00:29:44,830
It was a lot better after that.

446
00:29:44,865 --> 00:29:47,533
She was a lot happier.

447
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:55,908
[groans]

448
00:29:55,942 --> 00:29:57,409
Where the hell is he?

449
00:30:07,020 --> 00:30:11,523
I've been to my oncologist,
Jesse, just last week.

450
00:30:14,494 --> 00:30:16,695
I'm still in remission.

451
00:30:18,097 --> 00:30:20,031
I'm healthy.

452
00:30:20,066 --> 00:30:24,102
Okay, so good.
Great.

453
00:30:27,173 --> 00:30:30,475
Well, no end in sight.

454
00:30:36,849 --> 00:30:40,452
Well, I missed it.

455
00:30:46,459 --> 00:30:51,028
There was some perfect moment,

456
00:30:51,063 --> 00:30:53,030
and it passed me right by.

457
00:30:55,600 --> 00:31:00,304
Yeah, I had to have enough
to leave them.

458
00:31:00,338 --> 00:31:03,374
That was the whole point.

459
00:31:03,409 --> 00:31:07,612
None of this makes any sense

460
00:31:07,647 --> 00:31:10,115
if I didn't have enough.

461
00:31:12,352 --> 00:31:17,022
But it had to be before
she found out... Skyler.

462
00:31:17,056 --> 00:31:19,324
It had to be before that.

463
00:31:19,358 --> 00:31:22,694
Perfect moment...

464
00:31:22,729 --> 00:31:25,597
For what?

465
00:31:25,631 --> 00:31:27,599
To drop dead?

466
00:31:28,601 --> 00:31:30,369
What, are you saying
you want to die?

467
00:31:33,673 --> 00:31:37,643
I'm saying I've lived too long.

468
00:31:41,715 --> 00:31:44,550
You want them
to actually miss you.

469
00:31:44,584 --> 00:31:46,986
You know?

470
00:31:47,020 --> 00:31:49,422
You want their memories of you

471
00:31:49,456 --> 00:31:51,291
to be--

472
00:31:54,229 --> 00:31:57,565
But she just won't understand.

473
00:31:57,599 --> 00:31:59,567
She just--

474
00:31:59,602 --> 00:32:04,507
No matter how well
I explain it,

475
00:32:04,541 --> 00:32:07,644
these days
she just has this--

476
00:32:07,678 --> 00:32:11,348
this--

477
00:32:11,383 --> 00:32:12,650
I mean, I truly believe

478
00:32:12,684 --> 00:32:15,854
there exists
some combination of words.

479
00:32:15,888 --> 00:32:18,056
There must exist

480
00:32:18,091 --> 00:32:19,224
certain words

481
00:32:19,259 --> 00:32:22,462
in a certain, specific order

482
00:32:22,496 --> 00:32:24,264
that would explain all of this,

483
00:32:24,298 --> 00:32:28,102
but with her I just--

484
00:32:28,136 --> 00:32:31,206
I just can't ever seem
to find them.

485
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:33,675
Mr. White,
how about you just sit down?

486
00:32:33,709 --> 00:32:36,679
I was thinking maybe
before the fugue state,

487
00:32:36,713 --> 00:32:38,848
but before the fugue state

488
00:32:38,882 --> 00:32:40,216
they didn't have enough money,

489
00:32:40,250 --> 00:32:42,685
so no, not then.

490
00:32:51,595 --> 00:32:56,566
And plus my daughter
wasn't born yet.

491
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:59,402
It had to be
Afr Holly was born.

492
00:32:59,436 --> 00:33:01,070
Mr. White--

493
00:33:01,104 --> 00:33:03,272
Definitely before the surgery.

494
00:33:05,742 --> 00:33:08,511
Oh, Christ.

495
00:33:08,545 --> 00:33:10,613
That damn second cell one.

496
00:33:10,647 --> 00:33:12,515
How could I possibly...

497
00:33:14,017 --> 00:33:15,551
[groans]

498
00:33:23,393 --> 00:33:25,461
Ah, I know the moment.

499
00:33:30,133 --> 00:33:32,902
It was the night Jane died.

500
00:33:43,948 --> 00:33:48,948
And we needed diapers,
and so I said I'd go,

501
00:33:48,982 --> 00:33:51,747
but it was just an excuse.

502
00:33:51,782 --> 00:33:53,548
Actually, that was
the night I--

503
00:33:53,582 --> 00:33:56,380
I brought you your money,
remember?

504
00:33:56,415 --> 00:33:59,947
Yeah, I remember.

505
00:33:59,981 --> 00:34:04,280
But afterward I stopped
at a bar.

506
00:34:04,315 --> 00:34:09,279
It was odd.
I never do that, go to a bar alone.

507
00:34:09,313 --> 00:34:12,047
I just walked in, sat down.

508
00:34:17,352 --> 00:34:19,753
I never told you.

509
00:34:19,788 --> 00:34:21,688
That you went to a bar?

510
00:34:27,094 --> 00:34:32,097
I sit down, and this man,
this stranger,

511
00:34:32,131 --> 00:34:34,932
he engages me in conversation.

512
00:34:34,967 --> 00:34:36,601
Now, he's a complete stranger.

513
00:34:38,503 --> 00:34:42,873
But he turns out
to be Jane's father,

514
00:34:42,907 --> 00:34:46,043
Donald Margolis.

515
00:34:46,078 --> 00:34:47,678
What are you talking about?

516
00:34:47,713 --> 00:34:50,515
Of course I didn't know it
at the time.

517
00:34:50,549 --> 00:34:53,651
I mean, it was just some guy
in a bar.

518
00:34:53,685 --> 00:34:56,621
Didn't put it together
until after the crash

519
00:34:56,655 --> 00:34:57,889
when he was all over the news.

520
00:34:57,923 --> 00:35:00,559
Jane's dad.

521
00:35:00,593 --> 00:35:03,929
I mean, think of the odds.

522
00:35:03,964 --> 00:35:05,531
Once I tried to calculate them,

523
00:35:05,565 --> 00:35:07,800
but they're astronomical.

524
00:35:07,835 --> 00:35:10,403
I mean, think of the odds

525
00:35:10,437 --> 00:35:12,336
of me going in, sitting down

526
00:35:12,371 --> 00:35:14,733
that night in that bar

527
00:35:14,768 --> 00:35:16,268
next to that man.

528
00:35:19,637 --> 00:35:21,371
What did you talk about?

529
00:35:24,374 --> 00:35:28,843
Oh, water on Mars.

530
00:35:32,180 --> 00:35:33,947
Family.

531
00:35:35,916 --> 00:35:38,117
What about family?

532
00:35:41,554 --> 00:35:43,654
I told him
that I had a daughter,

533
00:35:43,689 --> 00:35:47,557
and he told me he had one, too.

534
00:35:47,558 --> 00:35:51,960
Then he said,
"Never give up on family."

535
00:35:54,930 --> 00:35:56,630
And I didn't.

536
00:35:58,333 --> 00:36:00,967
I-- I took his advice.

537
00:36:14,541 --> 00:36:16,273
[mutters]

538
00:36:16,307 --> 00:36:17,841
The universe is random.

539
00:36:17,875 --> 00:36:19,775
It's not inevitable.

540
00:36:19,810 --> 00:36:22,811
It's simple chaos.

541
00:36:22,845 --> 00:36:27,881
It's subatomic particles
in endless, aimless collision.

542
00:36:27,916 --> 00:36:30,317
That's what science teaches us,

543
00:36:30,351 --> 00:36:33,052
but what is this saying?

544
00:36:35,055 --> 00:36:36,622
What is it telling us,

545
00:36:36,656 --> 00:36:37,889
when on the very night

546
00:36:37,924 --> 00:36:42,527
that this man's daughter dies,

547
00:36:42,561 --> 00:36:46,231
it's me who's having
a drink with him?

548
00:36:49,869 --> 00:36:51,769
How can that be random?

549
00:36:51,803 --> 00:36:53,704
Hey, listen, Mr. White.
Hey--

550
00:36:53,739 --> 00:36:55,707
Hey, sit down.

551
00:36:55,741 --> 00:36:57,175
No-- No.

552
00:36:57,210 --> 00:37:00,780
No, it's--

553
00:37:01,916 --> 00:37:03,851
Oh.

554
00:37:03,885 --> 00:37:05,652
Oh.

555
00:37:09,024 --> 00:37:12,660
No, that--
that was the moment.

556
00:37:14,964 --> 00:37:16,464
That night.

557
00:37:20,170 --> 00:37:21,938
I should never have left home.

558
00:37:25,343 --> 00:37:27,278
Never gone to your house.

559
00:37:32,249 --> 00:37:35,518
Maybe things would have--

560
00:37:40,591 --> 00:37:42,993
Oh, thought I was--

561
00:37:45,832 --> 00:37:49,037
I was at home watching TV.

562
00:37:50,842 --> 00:37:53,580
Some--

563
00:37:53,614 --> 00:37:57,622
Some nature program
about elephants.

564
00:38:00,262 --> 00:38:02,867
Skyler and Holly
were in another room.

565
00:38:06,241 --> 00:38:08,578
I could hear them
on the baby monitor.

566
00:38:12,618 --> 00:38:14,585
She was singing a lullaby.

567
00:38:20,425 --> 00:38:22,159
Ah--

568
00:38:23,562 --> 00:38:29,233
If had just lived
right up to that moment

569
00:38:29,267 --> 00:38:31,268
and not one second more--

570
00:38:33,538 --> 00:38:35,773
[fly buzzing]

571
00:38:44,582 --> 00:38:47,083
...that would've been perfect.

572
00:39:00,003 --> 00:39:01,471
He's not coming down.

573
00:39:02,806 --> 00:39:06,275
Must be Thailand-hot
up there.

574
00:39:06,309 --> 00:39:09,611
That's why he likes it.

575
00:39:09,646 --> 00:39:13,716
Thailand's hot, right?

576
00:39:13,750 --> 00:39:14,984
Yeah.

577
00:39:15,018 --> 00:39:18,590
See? That's why.

578
00:39:18,625 --> 00:39:20,028
Oh, Jesus.

579
00:39:20,062 --> 00:39:21,464
Hey, wait.

580
00:39:21,498 --> 00:39:23,501
Here.

581
00:39:23,535 --> 00:39:25,571
[casters rolling]

582
00:39:27,843 --> 00:39:30,346
[sighs]

583
00:39:37,351 --> 00:39:39,882
He's not coming down.

584
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:44,092
He's staying up there forever.

585
00:39:54,671 --> 00:39:56,706
[footsteps]

586
00:40:09,286 --> 00:40:11,787
What are you--
What are you doing?

587
00:40:11,822 --> 00:40:14,787
What do you think?
I'm going to get that bitch.

588
00:40:16,956 --> 00:40:18,356
Uh...

589
00:40:20,024 --> 00:40:22,692
No, you're going to break
your neck.

590
00:40:22,726 --> 00:40:24,693
Yeah, yeah. Just--

591
00:40:26,962 --> 00:40:29,697
No, seriously, you're--
This is a bad idea.

592
00:40:29,731 --> 00:40:32,366
[grunting]
Damn it.

593
00:40:33,702 --> 00:40:35,102
Jesse.

594
00:40:35,136 --> 00:40:36,436
Just hold onto it.

595
00:40:36,470 --> 00:40:38,571
Hold it still?

596
00:40:52,751 --> 00:40:54,418
Jesse.

597
00:40:59,189 --> 00:41:00,723
I'm sorry.

598
00:41:00,757 --> 00:41:02,458
Sorry for what?

599
00:41:02,492 --> 00:41:03,626
Being a lunatic?

600
00:41:07,998 --> 00:41:09,665
I'm sorry about Jane.

601
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:20,443
Yeah. Me, too.

602
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:25,482
No, I mean, uh--

603
00:41:28,153 --> 00:41:31,288
I'm very sorry.

604
00:41:37,161 --> 00:41:40,095
It's not your fault.

605
00:41:40,130 --> 00:41:43,366
But it's not mine either.

606
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:45,501
It's no one's fault,

607
00:41:45,535 --> 00:41:47,436
not even hers.

608
00:41:54,072 --> 00:41:55,835
Sucker's just sitting there.

609
00:41:58,770 --> 00:42:02,841
We are who we are, Mr. White.

610
00:42:02,876 --> 00:42:05,510
You know, just two junkies

611
00:42:05,544 --> 00:42:08,613
with a duffel bag full of cash.

612
00:42:08,648 --> 00:42:10,249
Like you said,

613
00:42:10,284 --> 00:42:12,218
we both would've been dead
within a week.

614
00:42:14,087 --> 00:42:15,720
But I miss her, though.

615
00:42:20,259 --> 00:42:21,859
God, I do.

616
00:42:23,895 --> 00:42:26,929
[grunting]

617
00:42:26,964 --> 00:42:29,298
[gasps]

618
00:42:30,367 --> 00:42:34,035
Jesse, come down.

619
00:42:34,069 --> 00:42:37,371
Wait, I am so close.

620
00:42:40,107 --> 00:42:42,840
Let it go.

621
00:42:42,874 --> 00:42:44,375
We need to cook.

622
00:42:45,377 --> 00:42:47,244
What about the contamination?

623
00:42:49,113 --> 00:42:50,814
It's all contaminated.

624
00:42:52,950 --> 00:42:55,251
[sighs]

625
00:42:57,088 --> 00:42:59,857
[mutters]

626
00:42:59,891 --> 00:43:01,525
I definitely scared him.

627
00:43:04,129 --> 00:43:06,163
Probably stay out of our way--
[buzzing]

628
00:43:10,634 --> 00:43:12,435
[mutters]
God.

629
00:43:37,132 --> 00:43:38,367
Yeah!

630
00:43:38,402 --> 00:43:42,004
Zap! Somebody got got, yo!

631
00:43:42,039 --> 00:43:43,072
You see that, Mister--

632
00:43:43,106 --> 00:43:45,941
[Walt snoring]

633
00:44:12,532 --> 00:44:14,870
[metal rattling]

634
00:44:24,749 --> 00:44:26,950
[sighs]

635
00:44:31,256 --> 00:44:32,823
Bins are packed?

636
00:44:32,857 --> 00:44:34,891
Bins are packed.

637
00:44:36,527 --> 00:44:38,195
How's the yield?

638
00:44:38,229 --> 00:44:41,498
Two-oh-two and change.

639
00:44:41,532 --> 00:44:43,166
You okay getting home?

640
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:45,602
Yeah. Better.

641
00:44:45,636 --> 00:44:46,770
Thanks.

642
00:44:46,804 --> 00:44:48,471
<i>Ma?ana, then.</i>

643
00:44:56,614 --> 00:44:58,682
[engine starts]

644
00:45:03,387 --> 00:45:06,355
Jesse, come here.

645
00:45:09,559 --> 00:45:11,626
I couldn't chance
saying it inside.

646
00:45:11,661 --> 00:45:14,862
For all I know,
the lab's wired for sound.

647
00:45:16,665 --> 00:45:21,968
That half a pound
that I said we're off by--

648
00:45:22,002 --> 00:45:25,404
Now, I'm not accusing you,
but if...

649
00:45:26,639 --> 00:45:27,606
You understand?

650
00:45:27,640 --> 00:45:29,708
And if they
ever found out--

651
00:45:33,379 --> 00:45:35,747
I didn't take shit.

652
00:45:40,954 --> 00:45:44,289
I'm just saying that I won't
be able to protect you.

653
00:45:45,392 --> 00:45:47,960
Who's asking you to?

654
00:46:02,887 --> 00:46:05,722
[snoring]

655
00:46:15,568 --> 00:46:17,335
[fly buzzing]

656
00:46:19,638 --> 00:46:20,638
[buzzing]

657
00:46:21,940 --> 00:46:22,940
[buzzing]

658
00:46:25,577 --> 00:46:27,544
[buzzing]

659
00:46:33,418 --> 00:46:36,620
[buzzing]

660
00:46:36,654 --> 00:46:42,627
[buzzing continues]
