1
00:01:09,294 --> 00:01:12,905
<i>So cigarettes and gas is...</i>

2
00:01:12,939 --> 00:01:15,748
$79.70

3
00:01:17,656 --> 00:01:19,595
Crap.

4
00:01:19,630 --> 00:01:21,568
Oh, there's an ATM
right outside.

5
00:01:21,603 --> 00:01:25,748
Yeah,
I don't have a card.

6
00:01:25,783 --> 00:01:28,557
Well, you can write
a personal check with I.D.

7
00:01:29,862 --> 00:01:32,470
Kind of in between banks
right now.

8
00:01:34,109 --> 00:01:36,982
You think I could just
come back later?

9
00:01:37,016 --> 00:01:39,156
I'm totally good for it.
I'd come back.

10
00:01:39,191 --> 00:01:40,226
I swear.

11
00:01:43,202 --> 00:01:46,676
If it were me, I'd be,
"Totally, you know,
no problem."

12
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:49,484
But my dad is this
ginormous hardass.

13
00:01:49,518 --> 00:01:51,255
He was in Fallujah for a year,

14
00:01:51,290 --> 00:01:53,327
and he always checks
the receipts.

15
00:01:53,362 --> 00:01:56,268
I mean, like...always.

16
00:01:56,303 --> 00:01:58,005
I've got to call him.
I'm sorry.

17
00:01:58,039 --> 00:01:59,443
Wait, wait, wait.

18
00:01:59,477 --> 00:02:02,184
Hold-- Hold on a second.

19
00:02:04,055 --> 00:02:07,363
Maybe if we could, um...

20
00:02:07,397 --> 00:02:08,899
trade.

21
00:02:15,081 --> 00:02:17,554
Ever try it?

22
00:02:17,588 --> 00:02:21,596
I mean, I smoke pot
a lot sometimes.

23
00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:23,634
I party.

24
00:02:23,668 --> 00:02:27,443
But-- But that stuff's
really addictive, right?

25
00:02:27,477 --> 00:02:32,320
Not really. It's just
a media thing. You know?

26
00:02:36,028 --> 00:02:37,931
What's it like?

27
00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:44,512
It's awesome.

28
00:02:46,651 --> 00:02:51,460
Everything's
maximum interesting.

29
00:02:51,494 --> 00:02:53,865
You get these really cold

30
00:02:53,899 --> 00:02:58,474
and sharp-like
action dagger feelings.

31
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:04,887
It's awesome.

32
00:03:06,258 --> 00:03:08,527
Come on.
What do you say?

33
00:03:43,793 --> 00:03:44,793
<font color="#EC14BD">Sync by honeybunny</font>
<font color="#EC14BD">www.addic7ed.com</font>

34
00:04:04,789 --> 00:04:14,792
Have a nice day.

35
00:04:23,696 --> 00:04:25,663
Now, how does it feel?

36
00:04:25,698 --> 00:04:27,031
Does it hurt?

37
00:04:27,065 --> 00:04:29,533
Yeah, it's tight.

38
00:04:29,567 --> 00:04:32,001
Okay, but is it painful?

39
00:04:32,036 --> 00:04:33,770
It's hard to breathe.

40
00:04:33,804 --> 00:04:36,772
Well,
you need your breathing.

41
00:04:36,806 --> 00:04:38,707
Uh, well--

42
00:04:38,741 --> 00:04:40,674
although let's not
lose sight of the fact

43
00:04:40,709 --> 00:04:43,276
that you were the victim
of a terrible accident,
Antonio,

44
00:04:43,309 --> 00:04:45,709
so some discomfort
is to be expected.

45
00:04:52,816 --> 00:04:55,351
Let's go with that one.

46
00:04:55,386 --> 00:04:58,622
<i>Mucho gusto
en conocerle, se?±ora.</i>

47
00:04:58,657 --> 00:05:00,057
<i>La proxima vez,</i>

48
00:05:00,092 --> 00:05:01,759
<i>cashier's check, por favor.</i>

49
00:05:01,793 --> 00:05:03,093
Oh, and spread the word.

50
00:05:03,127 --> 00:05:06,062
I'm building a class-action,
flight 515.

51
00:05:06,097 --> 00:05:08,031
Victims' families
would be great,

52
00:05:08,065 --> 00:05:09,232
but I'll take
anyone on he ground

53
00:05:09,266 --> 00:05:10,766
who suffered emotionally--

54
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:14,202
anxiety, sleeplessness,
you get the picture.

55
00:05:14,237 --> 00:05:15,236
Trouble?

56
00:05:16,939 --> 00:05:19,173
<i>Ted Beneke?
You cannot be serious.</i>

57
00:05:19,207 --> 00:05:20,341
<i>That guys is a joke.</i>

58
00:05:20,375 --> 00:05:21,508
<i>You know what, Walt?</i>

59
00:05:21,543 --> 00:05:22,676
<i>You know what?
You called my bluff.</i>

60
00:05:22,710 --> 00:05:24,410
<i>I called your--
What does that even mean?</i>

61
00:05:24,445 --> 00:05:26,012
<i>You dared me
to tell the police,</i>

62
00:05:26,046 --> 00:05:28,047
<i>and I couldn't do it,
so you win.</i>

63
00:05:28,081 --> 00:05:29,748
<i>If you want to stay
in this house, fine,</i>

64
00:05:29,783 --> 00:05:31,516
<i>but we are not married
anymore.</i>

65
00:05:31,551 --> 00:05:34,018
<i>I told you that I was done
cooking meth, Skyler.</i>

66
00:05:34,053 --> 00:05:35,353
<i>Oh, right.
I promised you that.</i>

67
00:05:35,387 --> 00:05:36,888
<i>And so what?</i>

68
00:05:36,922 --> 00:05:38,822
<i>At least I didn't
run off to go--</i>

69
00:05:38,857 --> 00:05:41,291
<i>Jesus! I mean,
everything that I did</i>

70
00:05:41,325 --> 00:05:42,926
<i>I did for this family.</i>

71
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,360
<i>Oh, yeah, you just keep
telling yourself that.</i>

72
00:05:44,395 --> 00:05:46,128
<i>Oh, and what is that
supposed to mean?</i>

73
00:05:46,163 --> 00:05:47,963
<i>You don't like it?
Then leave</i>

74
00:05:47,998 --> 00:05:49,831
<i>and take your
drug money with you.</i>

75
00:05:49,866 --> 00:05:52,867
<i>That's what you want.</i>

76
00:05:52,902 --> 00:05:54,669
Jesus.

77
00:05:54,703 --> 00:05:56,570
Garbage disposal.

78
00:05:56,605 --> 00:05:58,605
<i>You think this will
get me to move out?</i>

79
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:00,073
<i>You can screw Ted.</i>

80
00:06:00,108 --> 00:06:02,308
<i>You can screw the butcher,
the mailman,</i>

81
00:06:02,343 --> 00:06:03,409
<i>whoever you want.</i>

82
00:06:03,443 --> 00:06:04,443
<i>Screw them all.</i>

83
00:06:04,478 --> 00:06:05,878
<i>I'm not going anywhere.</i>

84
00:06:05,912 --> 00:06:06,912
<i>Good. Suit yourself.</i>

85
00:06:08,514 --> 00:06:10,749
Is this a good
or bad thing?

86
00:06:12,618 --> 00:06:14,085
<i>You want me to suit myself?</i>

87
00:06:14,119 --> 00:06:16,987
<i>I'll suit myself
to his face!</i>

88
00:06:17,021 --> 00:06:18,689
It's a bad thing.

89
00:06:29,666 --> 00:06:30,766
Hello.

90
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,267
Ahem.

91
00:06:32,302 --> 00:06:34,236
Walter White
to see Ted Beneke.

92
00:06:34,270 --> 00:06:37,305
I'm sorry. Mr. Beneke's
on a conference call.

93
00:06:37,339 --> 00:06:40,107
Mm-hmm, okay.

94
00:06:40,142 --> 00:06:42,375
I will wait.

95
00:06:42,410 --> 00:06:44,444
It could be a while.

96
00:06:44,478 --> 00:06:46,513
I have all the time
in the world.

97
00:07:12,368 --> 00:07:15,470
Okay.

98
00:07:15,504 --> 00:07:17,138
Here we go. Okay.

99
00:07:17,172 --> 00:07:19,207
Excuse me. Mr. Beneke's
not available.
Ted?

100
00:07:19,241 --> 00:07:21,375
Come on.

101
00:07:24,412 --> 00:07:26,580
Ted, I can see you.

102
00:07:26,614 --> 00:07:29,215
I can see you standing
right there in your office.

103
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:31,150
Now, come on.

104
00:07:31,185 --> 00:07:33,552
Open the door.
Come on, let's talk.

105
00:07:33,586 --> 00:07:35,520
I just want to talk.
That's all.

106
00:07:35,555 --> 00:07:37,055
Come on, let's be men
about this. Huh? Okay?

107
00:07:37,089 --> 00:07:38,322
How about that?

108
00:07:38,357 --> 00:07:40,224
Aha.

109
00:07:40,259 --> 00:07:43,493
Hey, Walt, I'm kind of
in the middle of something
right now.

110
00:07:43,528 --> 00:07:46,763
Oh, yes, you are.
So open the door.

111
00:07:46,797 --> 00:07:49,432
You're damn right you are.
You're right in the middle.

112
00:07:49,466 --> 00:07:52,100
Just open the door,
and let's talk about it, okay?

113
00:07:52,134 --> 00:07:55,369
Open the door, Ted, right now.

114
00:07:55,403 --> 00:07:57,404
All right, you don't want
to be a man about it? Okay.

115
00:07:57,438 --> 00:07:59,438
Plan B. How do you like that?
Plan B.

116
00:07:59,473 --> 00:08:01,773
Oh, dear God.

117
00:08:03,075 --> 00:08:04,708
Plan B!

118
00:08:06,310 --> 00:08:08,410
Walt. Walt.

119
00:08:08,445 --> 00:08:10,245
Walt.

120
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:12,548
What are you doing?

121
00:08:12,583 --> 00:08:14,351
I'm talking with Ted.

122
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:20,490
Oh, Jesus.

123
00:08:20,524 --> 00:08:22,759
Huh?

124
00:08:25,129 --> 00:08:30,998
Next time,
you'll open the door.

125
00:08:32,267 --> 00:08:35,001
Oh, damn it.

126
00:08:35,035 --> 00:08:38,037
I'm just here to talk.
I just want to talk to him.

127
00:08:38,071 --> 00:08:41,775
God. Can I just talk?
I just want to talk to him.

128
00:08:41,810 --> 00:08:43,812
I'm just talk--

129
00:08:43,846 --> 00:08:45,781
All right. All right,
all right, all right,
I'm calm.

130
00:08:45,815 --> 00:08:48,217
I'm calm.

131
00:08:51,253 --> 00:08:52,386
Fuck.

132
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:08,767
Aah! Aah!

133
00:09:08,802 --> 00:09:10,969
What do you want?
What do you want?

134
00:09:11,004 --> 00:09:13,438
Hey! Hey, come on.

135
00:09:16,008 --> 00:09:18,009
What the hell
is wrong with you?

136
00:09:18,043 --> 00:09:20,177
You act like
you're the first guy
this ever happened to.

137
00:09:20,212 --> 00:09:24,347
I caught my second wife
screwing my stepdad, okay?

138
00:09:24,381 --> 00:09:27,616
It's a cruel world, Walt.
Grow up.

139
00:09:27,651 --> 00:09:29,818
I just wanted
to talk to him.

140
00:09:29,853 --> 00:09:31,953
Yeah, well,
now I'm talking to you.

141
00:09:31,988 --> 00:09:33,755
Consider this an intervention.

142
00:09:33,789 --> 00:09:36,324
You could have been
arrested back there.
You understand.

143
00:09:36,358 --> 00:09:38,159
I mean, speaking
as your lawyer,

144
00:09:38,193 --> 00:09:40,160
I'm always looking
for billable hours,

145
00:09:40,195 --> 00:09:42,529
but speaking
as your business associate,

146
00:09:42,563 --> 00:09:43,763
I'm strongly advising

147
00:09:43,798 --> 00:09:45,598
that you get your shit
together.

148
00:09:45,633 --> 00:09:49,635
Just cool it
with this Beneke guy,
at least for now.

149
00:09:49,669 --> 00:09:50,636
Okay?

150
00:09:52,138 --> 00:09:54,072
Let's talk shop

151
00:09:54,107 --> 00:09:56,040
because I think this is
a great opportunity

152
00:09:56,075 --> 00:09:58,376
to channel
some of that negative energy

153
00:09:58,410 --> 00:10:00,010
into something positive.

154
00:10:00,045 --> 00:10:01,778
How did you know?

155
00:10:01,813 --> 00:10:03,146
Sorry?

156
00:10:03,181 --> 00:10:04,547
About Skyler.

157
00:10:04,582 --> 00:10:06,115
About where to find me
just now.

158
00:10:06,150 --> 00:10:08,050
How did you know?

159
00:10:08,085 --> 00:10:09,918
That's
just my meticulousness.

160
00:10:09,953 --> 00:10:12,420
Don't bog down in detail,
Walt.

161
00:10:12,455 --> 00:10:13,488
The lesson here--

162
00:10:13,522 --> 00:10:15,390
Did you bug my house?

163
00:10:19,627 --> 00:10:22,995
Yeah, but I didn't know
it was your house, did I?
You had moved out.

164
00:10:23,030 --> 00:10:24,897
Besides,
you basically told me to.

165
00:10:24,931 --> 00:10:26,265
I told you to?

166
00:10:26,299 --> 00:10:28,100
You strongly hinted
that I should.

167
00:10:28,135 --> 00:10:30,502
You were worried
about your wife, remember?

168
00:10:30,537 --> 00:10:32,604
You were concerned
she might say something
to the police.

169
00:10:32,639 --> 00:10:34,740
What?
No, no, that's not true.

170
00:10:34,774 --> 00:10:37,075
When the hell
did I say that?

171
00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:40,012
Let's not get lost
in the who, what, and whens.

172
00:10:40,046 --> 00:10:43,015
The point is we did our
due diligence,

173
00:10:43,049 --> 00:10:44,516
and she didn't talk.

174
00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:45,517
She kept quiet.

175
00:10:45,552 --> 00:10:46,618
She stood by you, Walt,

176
00:10:46,653 --> 00:10:48,720
which, if you ask me,

177
00:10:48,755 --> 00:10:51,256
is the ironical
silver lining here.

178
00:10:51,291 --> 00:10:52,558
I mean, on the one hand,

179
00:10:52,592 --> 00:10:55,928
sure, she snuck off
the reservation

180
00:10:55,962 --> 00:10:57,630
to get some dirty,
damp, and deep.

181
00:10:57,664 --> 00:10:59,565
On the other hand--

182
00:11:15,144 --> 00:11:18,145
You're fired!
You're done!

183
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:20,948
Good. Oh, boo-hoo,
I won't cook meth anymore.

184
00:11:20,982 --> 00:11:22,849
You're a crybaby.
Who needs you?

185
00:11:22,883 --> 00:11:25,550
Hey, I'm unplugging
the Web site,
so no more money laundering.

186
00:11:25,584 --> 00:11:26,784
How do you like that?

187
00:11:26,818 --> 00:11:29,819
I want those bugs
out of my house today.

188
00:11:29,853 --> 00:11:31,687
I want them out now!

189
00:11:31,721 --> 00:11:35,423
Oh, you just bought
a $300 suit, psycho!

190
00:11:37,492 --> 00:11:39,059
Door.

191
00:11:44,897 --> 00:11:47,531
Great, drilled
right into the stucco.

192
00:11:47,565 --> 00:11:51,797
Oh, a little bit of putty,

193
00:11:51,831 --> 00:11:54,464
you'll be fine.

194
00:11:54,498 --> 00:11:57,232
Just make sure you get
all of those things.

195
00:11:57,267 --> 00:12:01,536
A, these things
cost $800 apiece.

196
00:12:01,570 --> 00:12:03,371
B, you're not
that interesting.

197
00:12:03,405 --> 00:12:05,973
So yeah,
I'll get all of them, Walter.

198
00:12:07,108 --> 00:12:10,011
Great line of work,
by the way.

199
00:12:10,045 --> 00:12:12,179
Real upstanding field.

200
00:12:12,214 --> 00:12:14,214
Yep, well...

201
00:12:15,815 --> 00:12:17,449
I enjoy it.

202
00:12:26,656 --> 00:12:30,059
You're free to leave now.
Anytime.

203
00:12:31,628 --> 00:12:34,796
You know, Walter,

204
00:12:34,831 --> 00:12:36,297
sometimes it doesn't hurt

205
00:12:36,331 --> 00:12:38,499
to have someone
watching your back.

206
00:13:56,755 --> 00:13:58,855
Mr. White?

207
00:14:04,396 --> 00:14:05,763
Hi.

208
00:14:07,866 --> 00:14:09,833
What's up?

209
00:14:12,536 --> 00:14:15,237
I can't begin to understand

210
00:14:15,272 --> 00:14:17,306
what you're going through,
Walt,

211
00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:19,107
with all
of your health concerns

212
00:14:19,141 --> 00:14:22,577
and the stresses
you've been under.

213
00:14:22,611 --> 00:14:24,644
Still, as educators,

214
00:14:24,679 --> 00:14:26,379
there are certain
responsibilities

215
00:14:26,414 --> 00:14:28,380
we need to be meeting here

216
00:14:28,415 --> 00:14:31,583
to the school
and to the students themselves.

217
00:14:31,617 --> 00:14:33,650
Yeah, of course.

218
00:14:35,353 --> 00:14:38,053
Is this a Wheaten terrier?

219
00:14:38,087 --> 00:14:42,155
Uh, Norfolk.

220
00:14:42,189 --> 00:14:43,688
Norfolk?

221
00:14:43,723 --> 00:14:47,157
That's surprising.

222
00:14:47,191 --> 00:14:49,525
Walt, could you
come back over here

223
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:51,096
and have a seat, please?

224
00:14:51,130 --> 00:14:53,033
Sure.

225
00:15:05,110 --> 00:15:08,044
You've been absent a lot
recently,

226
00:15:08,078 --> 00:15:10,778
and when you are here
at school,

227
00:15:10,813 --> 00:15:13,247
there have been
some behavioral questions,

228
00:15:13,281 --> 00:15:15,115
and frankly I'm concerned.

229
00:15:17,688 --> 00:15:20,256
Hm. Thank you.

230
00:15:29,465 --> 00:15:31,133
Are you feeling okay?

231
00:15:31,167 --> 00:15:35,404
And do you think maybe
I should call Skyler?

232
00:15:35,438 --> 00:15:38,173
Um...nah.

233
00:15:43,979 --> 00:15:48,748
Let's just keep this...

234
00:15:48,783 --> 00:15:50,416
What?

235
00:15:52,618 --> 00:15:53,885
Hey!

236
00:15:55,420 --> 00:15:57,154
Walt, what's wrong with you?

237
00:16:38,996 --> 00:16:40,393
You know, look,

238
00:16:40,427 --> 00:16:43,296
you're the one who was
talking about D.C., okay?

239
00:16:43,330 --> 00:16:45,098
This is how you get there.

240
00:16:45,132 --> 00:16:47,532
You answer the bell.
You pay your dues.

241
00:16:51,202 --> 00:16:52,569
Besides, it's-- you know,

242
00:16:52,603 --> 00:16:55,372
it's a big deal
to get picked for this.

243
00:16:57,209 --> 00:17:00,344
El Paso's like the Super Bowl.

244
00:17:02,614 --> 00:17:06,417
I could get killed crossing
the street, okay? Whatever.

245
00:17:06,452 --> 00:17:09,554
I want to go.

246
00:17:09,588 --> 00:17:11,255
What about last time?

247
00:17:11,289 --> 00:17:12,690
What about last time?

248
00:17:36,615 --> 00:17:37,749
Schrader.

249
00:17:38,751 --> 00:17:40,585
Hey, Sheriff. Yeah.

250
00:17:42,888 --> 00:17:44,723
Blue, huh?

251
00:17:46,859 --> 00:17:48,360
Yeah, yeah.

252
00:17:48,394 --> 00:17:50,862
Thing is, uh--

253
00:17:50,897 --> 00:17:52,864
Thing is I'm supposed to be
getting on a plane right now.

254
00:17:58,805 --> 00:18:00,105
The stuff this guy had
was blue.

255
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:01,974
You sure about that?

256
00:18:04,778 --> 00:18:06,211
Yeah.

257
00:18:07,714 --> 00:18:08,948
Yeah, I want to talk to him.

258
00:18:12,753 --> 00:18:14,220
Taxi.

259
00:18:53,826 --> 00:18:54,926
Hi.

260
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:56,427
Man, I'm sorry.
I needed to talk to you,

261
00:18:56,462 --> 00:18:59,230
but you weren't at your
apartment.

262
00:18:59,264 --> 00:19:02,199
No, I moved back home.

263
00:19:02,234 --> 00:19:03,667
That's good, right?

264
00:19:04,669 --> 00:19:05,836
Yeah.

265
00:19:05,870 --> 00:19:08,572
Yo, did you just get fired?

266
00:19:08,606 --> 00:19:13,042
No. No, no, no, it's, uh...

267
00:19:13,077 --> 00:19:14,410
more like a sabbatical.

268
00:19:14,445 --> 00:19:17,547
Indefinite. Yeah.

269
00:19:17,581 --> 00:19:19,315
Oh.

270
00:19:20,483 --> 00:19:22,217
Uh...

271
00:19:31,595 --> 00:19:35,264
So what's up?

272
00:19:35,299 --> 00:19:38,501
Uh, should we go somewhere?

273
00:19:38,535 --> 00:19:40,703
No. This is fine.

274
00:19:42,406 --> 00:19:46,809
So, um, I want an intro
to your guy.

275
00:19:46,843 --> 00:19:47,976
What guy?

276
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:51,846
Your guy.
Your distribution guy,

277
00:19:51,881 --> 00:19:53,181
The guy
Saul hooked you up with.

278
00:19:53,215 --> 00:19:55,814
No, no, no, no, no.
Come on, Jesse.

279
00:19:55,849 --> 00:19:59,281
I thought about it,
and I want to.

280
00:19:59,316 --> 00:20:01,915
It's the one thing
I'm good at.

281
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:04,782
No, that is just not true.

282
00:20:04,817 --> 00:20:07,583
You're good
at a lot of things, son.

283
00:20:07,617 --> 00:20:08,950
Like what?

284
00:20:12,085 --> 00:20:13,884
What about your sobriety?

285
00:20:14,919 --> 00:20:17,851
I told you. I'm not using.

286
00:20:17,885 --> 00:20:22,717
Ever. I just want
back into the business.

287
00:20:27,221 --> 00:20:29,560
Well, I don't.

288
00:20:29,594 --> 00:20:31,294
I'm sorry.

289
00:20:31,329 --> 00:20:33,393
I know, and that's cool.

290
00:20:33,428 --> 00:20:36,834
I'm not asking you to cook.

291
00:20:39,282 --> 00:20:41,516
What's this?

292
00:20:41,550 --> 00:20:46,287
In the end, I just went
with two reflux condensers.

293
00:20:46,321 --> 00:20:48,689
I didn't want to lose track
of my Ph levels,

294
00:20:48,724 --> 00:20:51,359
but I did everything else
just like you taught

295
00:20:51,393 --> 00:20:53,361
me.

296
00:20:54,896 --> 00:20:56,564
Super careful in my amounts

297
00:20:56,598 --> 00:20:59,266
and watched the numbers
every step of the way.

298
00:21:00,901 --> 00:21:02,802
So what do you think?

299
00:21:02,836 --> 00:21:04,503
It's good, right?

300
00:21:06,973 --> 00:21:11,809
What in the hell is this?

301
00:21:13,078 --> 00:21:14,378
What?

302
00:21:14,413 --> 00:21:16,580
What? This. This.

303
00:21:16,614 --> 00:21:18,515
This is my product.

304
00:21:18,549 --> 00:21:19,649
This is my formula.

305
00:21:19,683 --> 00:21:21,217
This is mine.

306
00:21:21,251 --> 00:21:24,352
Okay, it's our product,

307
00:21:24,387 --> 00:21:26,020
but yeah,
I was going to cut you in.

308
00:21:26,055 --> 00:21:27,522
You were going to cut me in?

309
00:21:27,556 --> 00:21:29,823
No, no, no. I cut you in.

310
00:21:29,857 --> 00:21:31,358
What the hell is your problem?

311
00:21:31,392 --> 00:21:34,193
All I'm asking
is for you to set a meet.

312
00:21:34,227 --> 00:21:35,461
Absolutely not.

313
00:21:35,495 --> 00:21:36,928
Why?

314
00:21:39,465 --> 00:21:41,332
Because I am not
going to lend my name

315
00:21:41,366 --> 00:21:42,466
to an inferior product.

316
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:44,867
I mean,
look at the diameters here.

317
00:21:44,902 --> 00:21:46,736
What did you use for reduction?

318
00:21:46,770 --> 00:21:49,871
Don't tell me.
Platinum dioxide, right?

319
00:21:49,906 --> 00:21:53,241
No. Mercury-aluminum
amalgam.

320
00:21:53,275 --> 00:21:55,476
The dioxide's
too hard to keep wet.

321
00:21:55,511 --> 00:21:59,045
All right, well, you must've
done it wrong, then.

322
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:00,880
Your color is all cloudy,

323
00:22:00,915 --> 00:22:03,116
so you were struggling
with distillation, too.

324
00:22:03,150 --> 00:22:06,051
Now, this is very shoddy work,
Pinkman.

325
00:22:06,086 --> 00:22:07,953
I'm actually
embarrassed for you.

326
00:22:07,987 --> 00:22:10,555
What?

327
00:22:10,589 --> 00:22:12,890
No way.
I gave out samples,

328
00:22:12,924 --> 00:22:14,458
and everyone said
it was the bomb.

329
00:22:15,593 --> 00:22:18,227
Oh, they said it was the bomb.

330
00:22:18,261 --> 00:22:20,129
And who are they? I wonder.

331
00:22:20,163 --> 00:22:21,530
Huh? A bunch of meth heads?

332
00:22:21,564 --> 00:22:23,098
Yeah.
Yeah.

333
00:22:23,132 --> 00:22:24,332
They should know, right?

334
00:22:24,367 --> 00:22:25,366
Yeah, well, sorry.

335
00:22:25,401 --> 00:22:26,467
I can't help you.

336
00:22:26,502 --> 00:22:27,802
Fine, asswad.

337
00:22:27,836 --> 00:22:29,904
You know what?
I'll contact the guy myself.

338
00:22:29,938 --> 00:22:32,739
Oh, yeah? Good luck with that
because my guy is a pro,

339
00:22:32,773 --> 00:22:34,440
and he doesn't deal
with junkies.

340
00:22:34,474 --> 00:22:35,972
You know what? Eat me.

341
00:22:36,006 --> 00:22:39,306
Anytime, loser. Hey. Hey!

342
00:22:39,340 --> 00:22:40,907
Hey. Hey!

343
00:23:19,328 --> 00:23:21,363
I can't believe
it's only 4:00.

344
00:23:22,998 --> 00:23:25,366
This day is dragging.

345
00:23:28,402 --> 00:23:29,702
Mm.

346
00:24:03,972 --> 00:24:05,608
I wish I could stay.

347
00:24:06,715 --> 00:24:08,118
So stay.

348
00:24:11,690 --> 00:24:13,657
What's stopping you?

349
00:24:16,093 --> 00:24:19,295
What? Like everything,
you mean?

350
00:24:19,329 --> 00:24:24,699
How about my lunatic husband
refusing to leave the house?

351
00:24:24,734 --> 00:24:26,267
Ahem.

352
00:24:26,302 --> 00:24:28,802
So move in here.

353
00:24:28,837 --> 00:24:33,005
And then my son
hating me even more.

354
00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:34,806
Nah.

355
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:36,073
It'll pass.

356
00:24:36,108 --> 00:24:37,808
I went through that
with the girls.

357
00:24:37,842 --> 00:24:39,676
They adapt.

358
00:24:39,711 --> 00:24:41,445
And now everyone at work

359
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:44,415
thinks I'm an evil,
ladder-climbing whore.

360
00:24:44,450 --> 00:24:45,783
They're all fired
effective immediately.

361
00:24:47,186 --> 00:24:48,219
What else?

362
00:24:50,355 --> 00:24:52,823
Oh, aren't you the answer man.

363
00:24:56,995 --> 00:24:58,830
Where did it--

364
00:25:02,135 --> 00:25:03,669
Where did it go wrong,
exactly--

365
00:25:03,703 --> 00:25:05,804
you and Walt?

366
00:25:10,044 --> 00:25:12,749
I mean, I always saw him
as kind of...

367
00:25:15,953 --> 00:25:17,253
mild-mannered.

368
00:25:18,788 --> 00:25:21,792
Something, I don't know,
change when he got sick,
or...?

369
00:25:24,530 --> 00:25:27,398
I don't know what changed,
Ted,

370
00:25:27,432 --> 00:25:30,968
and I just don't feel
really comfortable
talking about it.

371
00:25:31,002 --> 00:25:32,903
Sorry.

372
00:25:34,338 --> 00:25:36,638
Just asking
out of self-interest.

373
00:25:36,672 --> 00:25:38,539
Got to make sure I don't
make the same mistake.

374
00:25:41,342 --> 00:25:43,542
I would be amazed.

375
00:25:46,345 --> 00:25:49,013
Just let me see if I'm
following you here, Russell.

376
00:25:49,048 --> 00:25:54,152
You got this stuff
from some guy at Gasparza's

377
00:25:54,186 --> 00:25:55,820
who was wearing tan pants

378
00:25:55,854 --> 00:25:58,288
and who you're 80% sure

379
00:25:58,323 --> 00:26:00,492
had a mustache.

380
00:26:00,527 --> 00:26:01,962
That's it, right?

381
00:26:01,997 --> 00:26:04,933
That's your brain
working at maximum capacity?

382
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:13,707
Russell.

383
00:26:15,209 --> 00:26:16,743
Everything all right
in there?

384
00:26:19,047 --> 00:26:22,616
Mel.
The dude's name was Mel.

385
00:26:22,650 --> 00:26:24,951
Well, there you go. See?

386
00:26:24,985 --> 00:26:27,520
You served
an actual earthly function.

387
00:26:27,554 --> 00:26:29,521
I can't believe
I remembered that.

388
00:26:29,556 --> 00:26:31,123
Mel who?

389
00:26:31,157 --> 00:26:33,859
Does he have a last name?

390
00:26:33,893 --> 00:26:35,960
Yeah, uh, Mel.

391
00:26:37,596 --> 00:26:39,063
Wait.

392
00:26:40,398 --> 00:26:41,665
Was it Mel?

393
00:26:41,699 --> 00:26:44,267
Um...Mark.

394
00:26:45,603 --> 00:26:47,637
It was definitely an "M" name.

395
00:26:47,671 --> 00:26:49,739
Oh, man, I'm losing it.

396
00:26:49,773 --> 00:26:51,674
Wait, wait.

397
00:26:54,311 --> 00:26:55,310
Yeah.

398
00:26:56,643 --> 00:26:58,376
It's gone.

399
00:26:59,675 --> 00:27:00,908
It's gone.

400
00:27:00,942 --> 00:27:03,141
It was an "M" name,
though.

401
00:27:03,175 --> 00:27:06,040
I remember the "muh" sound.

402
00:27:06,075 --> 00:27:08,174
Oh. Huh?

403
00:27:08,208 --> 00:27:11,907
We'll go with the "muh" sound.

404
00:27:11,941 --> 00:27:12,908
Thanks a lot.

405
00:27:12,942 --> 00:27:13,908
Yeah.
Appreciate it.

406
00:27:13,943 --> 00:27:16,110
He definitely had tan pants.

407
00:27:19,481 --> 00:27:21,347
Remind me to get a vasectomy.

408
00:27:21,382 --> 00:27:22,815
Okay, it's after 9,

409
00:27:22,850 --> 00:27:24,650
so this bar
that Girl George is at,

410
00:27:24,685 --> 00:27:26,752
probably wall-to-wall
dirtbags by now.

411
00:27:26,786 --> 00:27:28,320
Let's go have
a little looky-loo,

412
00:27:28,355 --> 00:27:31,423
see if we can't find
this M-named clown.

413
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:36,627
What?

414
00:27:36,661 --> 00:27:37,928
It's a lead.

415
00:27:37,963 --> 00:27:39,363
Lead to what?

416
00:27:39,397 --> 00:27:40,998
To Heisenberg.

417
00:27:41,032 --> 00:27:42,432
I told you it was only
a matter of time

418
00:27:42,466 --> 00:27:44,567
before this guy
booted up again.

419
00:27:44,601 --> 00:27:46,835
Here we go, my friend.

420
00:27:46,870 --> 00:27:48,837
Don't hate me
because I'm beautiful, Gomie.

421
00:27:48,871 --> 00:27:50,939
Just apologize
and buy me a beer.

422
00:27:53,041 --> 00:27:55,042
Man, you're reaching.

423
00:27:55,076 --> 00:27:56,710
This stuff
could be a knockoff

424
00:27:56,744 --> 00:27:59,346
or left over
from an older cook.

425
00:27:59,380 --> 00:28:01,314
How do you know Heisenberg's
gearing up again?

426
00:28:03,016 --> 00:28:05,250
How do I know?

427
00:28:05,284 --> 00:28:06,784
Because I know.

428
00:28:07,852 --> 00:28:09,452
I don't get it.

429
00:28:09,487 --> 00:28:12,955
This is the reason
why you're blowing off
the task force?

430
00:28:12,989 --> 00:28:14,256
Chase down teeners?

431
00:28:15,792 --> 00:28:18,993
I'm getting tired
of all the second guessing.

432
00:28:19,028 --> 00:28:22,729
If you're not
sufficiently stimulated
by this investigation,

433
00:28:22,764 --> 00:28:25,098
do us both a favor
and ask for a transfer.

434
00:28:25,132 --> 00:28:27,733
What is up with you lately?

435
00:28:27,767 --> 00:28:29,668
Starting bar fights?

436
00:28:29,702 --> 00:28:31,637
Turning down El Paso?

437
00:28:31,671 --> 00:28:33,105
And now this bullshit?

438
00:28:33,139 --> 00:28:35,474
Do you need to talk
to someone or what?

439
00:28:36,776 --> 00:28:39,243
Talk to someone?

440
00:28:39,278 --> 00:28:40,677
Talk to who?

441
00:28:44,648 --> 00:28:48,883
I'm not trying to step
on your toes, bro. Okay?

442
00:28:48,918 --> 00:28:51,518
I'm just worried about you.
That's all.

443
00:28:51,553 --> 00:28:54,153
Appreciate that...bro.

444
00:28:55,855 --> 00:28:58,256
Now take your hand
off my shoulder.

445
00:29:12,799 --> 00:29:14,700
Yeah, yeah,
the one that was on TV.

446
00:29:14,734 --> 00:29:18,069
Did any little piece
fall on your property?

447
00:29:18,104 --> 00:29:21,338
I'm not looking
for an entire wing here,
Mr. Linkas.

448
00:29:21,373 --> 00:29:22,873
It could be a nut or a bolt.

449
00:29:22,907 --> 00:29:24,607
It could be a bag of peanuts,

450
00:29:24,641 --> 00:29:27,709
just so long as it caused you
pain and suffering.

451
00:29:27,743 --> 00:29:29,277
Oh, no, no, no. Closed.

452
00:29:29,311 --> 00:29:30,344
Uh, calling you back.

453
00:29:30,378 --> 00:29:32,345
You had your chance.

454
00:29:32,380 --> 00:29:33,980
I told you to get him
cooking again,

455
00:29:34,014 --> 00:29:35,581
and you blew it off,
and now it's too late.

456
00:29:35,616 --> 00:29:37,951
The guy's gone
mass maniac on us!

457
00:29:37,985 --> 00:29:40,586
All I wanted was to show
you two your potential,

458
00:29:40,620 --> 00:29:41,887
and what do I get in return?

459
00:29:41,921 --> 00:29:44,389
A bone contusion.
You want to see the scar?

460
00:29:44,424 --> 00:29:46,290
I wish you two had--

461
00:29:46,325 --> 00:29:48,159
Hi, there.

462
00:29:49,661 --> 00:29:51,028
How in the hell
did you get Walt to--

463
00:29:51,063 --> 00:29:52,964
I made it.

464
00:29:52,998 --> 00:29:56,401
You know the guy
who knows the guy, right?

465
00:30:29,467 --> 00:30:33,169
Uh, good news is,
for a stage three cancer,

466
00:30:33,203 --> 00:30:35,538
the guy's doing well
physically.

467
00:30:35,573 --> 00:30:36,572
Mentally,

468
00:30:36,607 --> 00:30:38,141
the guy's a disaster.

469
00:30:38,175 --> 00:30:39,375
He's gone off the rails

470
00:30:39,410 --> 00:30:41,777
over this thing
with his wife.

471
00:30:41,812 --> 00:30:44,613
My opinion,
he's not coming back,

472
00:30:44,648 --> 00:30:46,748
not on his own.

473
00:30:50,352 --> 00:30:53,754
Your friends were
at his place again,
by the way.

474
00:30:53,788 --> 00:30:56,358
They drew something
on the street
outside his house.

475
00:30:57,663 --> 00:30:59,097
The scythe.

476
00:30:59,132 --> 00:31:01,468
Animals.

477
00:31:01,502 --> 00:31:02,971
Does the lawyer know?
Should he?

478
00:31:03,006 --> 00:31:04,574
No.

479
00:31:06,980 --> 00:31:09,349
If you want this guy
to produce again,

480
00:31:09,384 --> 00:31:10,952
why not just tell him?

481
00:31:10,986 --> 00:31:12,086
You're the only thing

482
00:31:12,121 --> 00:31:13,754
that stands between him
and an ax in the head.

483
00:31:13,788 --> 00:31:16,089
I don't believe fear to be
an effective motivator.

484
00:31:16,123 --> 00:31:18,324
I want investment.

485
00:31:18,358 --> 00:31:22,227
For now, I'm simply
interested in time frame.

486
00:31:22,261 --> 00:31:24,596
He will live for the
foreseeable future, yes?

487
00:31:24,630 --> 00:31:26,564
Mm, foreseeable,

488
00:31:26,598 --> 00:31:27,598
couple years at least,

489
00:31:27,632 --> 00:31:30,834
barring acts of G--
and men with axes.

490
00:31:30,868 --> 00:31:33,636
Oh, from the lawyer,

491
00:31:33,671 --> 00:31:35,138
I'm supposed to let you know

492
00:31:35,172 --> 00:31:37,773
the Pinkman kid
is looking to sell.

493
00:31:37,807 --> 00:31:39,608
I don't work with junkies.

494
00:31:39,642 --> 00:31:41,543
That's what I thought
you'd say.

495
00:31:41,578 --> 00:31:43,578
Probably for the best.

496
00:31:43,613 --> 00:31:46,047
What I hear,
he and Walter are splitsville.

497
00:31:48,083 --> 00:31:49,150
Really?

498
00:31:49,184 --> 00:31:50,617
That's what Goodman says.

499
00:31:50,652 --> 00:31:52,752
Cats and dogs.

500
00:31:54,721 --> 00:31:56,221
Do the deal.

501
00:31:57,357 --> 00:31:59,324
Mm.

502
00:32:01,126 --> 00:32:02,693
Hm.

503
00:33:22,903 --> 00:33:25,037
<i>You have one unheard message.</i>

504
00:33:26,021 --> 00:33:30,524
<i>Agent Schrader,
you need to be calling
me back ASAP. Clear?</i>

505
00:33:30,558 --> 00:33:32,893
<i>I've got Texas
breathing down my neck,
and I'm not about--</i>

506
00:33:55,747 --> 00:33:57,347
Yeah, I haven't see Matt

507
00:33:59,750 --> 00:34:01,550
Where can I find him,
you think?

508
00:34:01,584 --> 00:34:03,551
No idea.
I haven't seen him--

509
00:34:03,586 --> 00:34:05,086
I know.
You said that a few times.

510
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:07,055
Yeah, because
I haven't seen him.

511
00:34:07,089 --> 00:34:08,589
I don't know
what else to say.

512
00:34:13,328 --> 00:34:15,262
What's your name, darling?

513
00:34:15,296 --> 00:34:16,829
Cara.

514
00:34:22,935 --> 00:34:24,602
Where did this come from,
Cara?

515
00:34:26,104 --> 00:34:27,638
I-- I don't know.

516
00:34:28,807 --> 00:34:30,908
What is it? Drugs?

517
00:34:34,012 --> 00:34:35,980
Look, I'm just going to come
right out and say it.

518
00:34:36,014 --> 00:34:40,085
Um, you're a bad liar, Cara.

519
00:34:40,119 --> 00:34:42,420
Don't get me wrong.

520
00:34:42,455 --> 00:34:44,089
Not the worst I've ever seen.

521
00:34:45,391 --> 00:34:49,161
Once had a guy try to explain
the dope balloon up his butt

522
00:34:49,195 --> 00:34:50,495
on bad Thai food.

523
00:34:50,530 --> 00:34:54,298
Still, you're not
a very good liar.

524
00:34:56,101 --> 00:34:57,301
I honestly don't know

525
00:34:57,336 --> 00:34:59,136
Stop.

526
00:34:59,171 --> 00:35:01,238
You look like a good kid.

527
00:35:01,273 --> 00:35:02,673
I'm not here
to get you in trouble,

528
00:35:02,707 --> 00:35:05,876
but you need to tell me
where this came from
right now!

529
00:35:10,114 --> 00:35:13,517
I never do stuff like this.
I swear to God.

530
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:18,422
I tried it, and I hated it,
so I just gave it to Matt.

531
00:35:18,456 --> 00:35:19,790
Okay, and who gave it to you?

532
00:35:19,824 --> 00:35:22,225
Some guy, he came in
a couple days ago

533
00:35:22,259 --> 00:35:24,861
and wanted to trade it
for gas.

534
00:35:24,895 --> 00:35:26,796
Some guy?
W-What's his name?

535
00:35:28,465 --> 00:35:30,132
Okay, w--

536
00:35:30,166 --> 00:35:31,401
What did he look like?

537
00:35:33,337 --> 00:35:36,106
I don't know. Um--

538
00:35:36,140 --> 00:35:38,241
He looked pretty normal.

539
00:35:38,276 --> 00:35:42,345
You know? Um, white--

540
00:35:42,380 --> 00:35:43,547
um...

541
00:35:43,581 --> 00:35:48,050
I think his hair
was lightish brown.

542
00:35:48,084 --> 00:35:50,686
He had really blue eyes.

543
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:54,222
They were really,
really blue.

544
00:35:54,257 --> 00:35:56,858
He's dreamy.
Okay, w-w-what else?

545
00:35:56,892 --> 00:35:58,560
Piercings,ewelry,

546
00:35:58,594 --> 00:36:00,127
distinctive articles
of clothing?

547
00:36:00,162 --> 00:36:01,863
Come on.

548
00:36:01,897 --> 00:36:03,430
Come on.

549
00:36:05,033 --> 00:36:06,534
Listen to me.

550
00:36:08,270 --> 00:36:13,840
It's real important
that I find the person
that had these drugs,

551
00:36:13,875 --> 00:36:18,646
so if you can remember
anything elsabout him...

552
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:20,714
Come on.

553
00:36:22,817 --> 00:36:25,319
He drove an RV.

554
00:36:25,353 --> 00:36:26,620
Okay, good, good.

555
00:36:26,655 --> 00:36:29,019
What can you remember?
What kind of RV?

556
00:36:29,053 --> 00:36:31,188
What color?
Did you spot a license plate?

557
00:36:32,490 --> 00:36:34,758
I don't knot the kinds,

558
00:36:34,793 --> 00:36:38,495
and I didn't see the license,

559
00:36:38,530 --> 00:36:43,434
but the color was, I think,
white, brownish color.

560
00:36:45,704 --> 00:36:48,239
I'm sorry.

561
00:36:48,273 --> 00:36:52,109
I know I'm not helping you,
but...

562
00:36:52,143 --> 00:36:54,811
Please don't tell my dad.

563
00:37:04,178 --> 00:37:05,411
Cara.

564
00:37:07,580 --> 00:37:11,243
Please tell me
that that camera works.

565
00:37:25,953 --> 00:37:27,320
Damn it.

566
00:38:24,350 --> 00:38:26,017
Bingo.

567
00:38:46,100 --> 00:38:48,701
These eggs are good,
Mom.

568
00:38:48,736 --> 00:38:50,436
Thanks.

569
00:38:52,438 --> 00:38:54,038
Hey,
you know what's weird?

570
00:38:54,072 --> 00:38:55,739
Dad's Web site.

571
00:38:55,773 --> 00:38:58,808
It's been three days
since the last donation.

572
00:39:00,810 --> 00:39:03,878
Yeah, well...

573
00:39:03,912 --> 00:39:06,413
people lose interest.

574
00:39:16,687 --> 00:39:17,753
Um...

575
00:39:19,956 --> 00:39:22,590
So how long
are you off for?

576
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:29,394
A few weeks.

577
00:39:29,428 --> 00:39:31,529
Uh, we'll play it by ear.

578
00:39:34,865 --> 00:39:38,833
I probably...
pushed it, you know,

579
00:39:38,868 --> 00:39:40,634
going back to work so soon.

580
00:39:49,508 --> 00:39:51,775
Think-- Think
I can get a ride today?

581
00:39:51,810 --> 00:39:53,910
Louis has
a doctor's appointment.

582
00:39:56,046 --> 00:39:58,347
Uh...yeah.

583
00:40:02,818 --> 00:40:07,520
Hey, so Dad can
babysit now. Right?

584
00:40:08,922 --> 00:40:12,691
You won't have to take
Holly to work every day.

585
00:40:21,498 --> 00:40:23,865
Sometime, maybe.

586
00:40:26,302 --> 00:40:27,737
We'll see.

587
00:41:10,551 --> 00:41:11,886
What's up?

588
00:41:16,894 --> 00:41:19,394
I think you'll
seriously enjoy, yo.

589
00:41:34,473 --> 00:41:35,506
Wait.

590
00:41:36,508 --> 00:41:38,075
No, no.

591
00:41:38,110 --> 00:41:39,743
No. Wait.

592
00:41:41,547 --> 00:41:42,981
Hey!

593
00:41:44,116 --> 00:41:45,183
Hey!

594
00:41:46,819 --> 00:41:48,320
Hey.

595
00:41:48,354 --> 00:41:51,292
What the hell?
This is only half.

596
00:41:51,326 --> 00:41:53,595
That's right.
It's your half.

597
00:41:56,467 --> 00:41:57,435
Yo!

598
00:41:57,469 --> 00:42:00,141
Where's the other half,
bitch?

599
00:42:01,278 --> 00:42:03,114
I mean, it was, uh--
--

600
00:42:03,148 --> 00:42:04,916
The whole thing
was crazy, man.

601
00:42:04,951 --> 00:42:06,384
Poor bastard.
I felt sorry for him.

602
00:42:06,418 --> 00:42:09,887
He actually thought we were
the cable guys, you know?

603
00:42:11,890 --> 00:42:13,923
Anyway, uh, um,

604
00:42:13,957 --> 00:42:16,058
sorry about those miscalls,
Chief.

605
00:42:16,092 --> 00:42:18,426
I'm changing providers.
It won't happen again.

606
00:42:20,061 --> 00:42:22,429
Are you going
to El Paso, Hank?

607
00:42:22,463 --> 00:42:23,797
Hell, yes!

608
00:42:23,831 --> 00:42:25,932
With pointed boots
and bells on.

609
00:42:25,966 --> 00:42:28,200
Just I got this break
in the Heisenberg case.

610
00:42:28,235 --> 00:42:29,501
The blue meth,
you mean?

611
00:42:29,536 --> 00:42:30,969
The teenth?

612
00:42:31,004 --> 00:42:33,805
Yeah, well, that teenth
got things rolling.

613
00:42:33,839 --> 00:42:35,673
I traced it
to a gas station in Cibola.

614
00:42:35,707 --> 00:42:36,974
That's where I got these.

615
00:42:37,008 --> 00:42:40,110
Now, the station's, uh,
closed circuit, uh, was down--

616
00:42:40,144 --> 00:42:41,278
surprise, surprise--

617
00:42:41,312 --> 00:42:43,847
but I was able to pull
some of these snapshots

618
00:42:43,881 --> 00:42:46,248
off an ATM security camera.

619
00:42:46,283 --> 00:42:47,516
Hey, now, I always thought

620
00:42:47,550 --> 00:42:48,983
these guys might be
camper cooking, right?

621
00:42:49,018 --> 00:42:51,852
First off, your typical
Class C motor home

622
00:42:51,887 --> 00:42:53,854
is going to grunt
at least 5,000 pounds

623
00:42:53,888 --> 00:42:55,088
of interior fixtures, okay?

624
00:42:55,123 --> 00:42:56,623
We're talking appliances,
furniture, built-ins.

625
00:42:56,657 --> 00:42:58,458
5,000 pounds at least, okay?

626
00:42:58,492 --> 00:43:01,293
See how high that
suspension's riding?

627
00:43:01,328 --> 00:43:04,996
No way, no how, this thing's
carrying that kind of weight.

628
00:43:05,031 --> 00:43:07,298
I mean, this thing
has been cleared out

629
00:43:07,332 --> 00:43:09,166
and stripped down
to its tight and curlies.

630
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:10,601
For what?

631
00:43:10,635 --> 00:43:12,535
Blood bank?

632
00:43:12,570 --> 00:43:15,571
Maybe a bookmobile?

633
00:43:15,606 --> 00:43:18,507
There's no clear view
of the plates.

634
00:43:18,542 --> 00:43:21,176
Yeah, well, you can only
get so lucky, right?

635
00:43:21,211 --> 00:43:23,345
But the fact that there's
no front plate

636
00:43:23,379 --> 00:43:25,147
tells me its likely
New Mexico registration.

637
00:43:25,181 --> 00:43:26,614
I checked with DMV.

638
00:43:26,649 --> 00:43:29,116
There are only 29
of these early '80s Bounders

639
00:43:29,151 --> 00:43:30,451
registered in the state.

640
00:43:33,087 --> 00:43:34,821
Only 29?

641
00:43:34,855 --> 00:43:36,055
Yeah.

642
00:43:36,090 --> 00:43:39,091
So I got to go, uh,
you know, knock on some doors.

643
00:43:47,299 --> 00:43:49,299
They need you
in El Paso, Hank.

644
00:43:49,334 --> 00:43:51,034
You bet. I-- I--

645
00:43:51,069 --> 00:43:53,203
I'm just going to wrap up
this Heisenberg thing first.

646
00:43:53,237 --> 00:43:55,071
So you're refusing
the assignment.

647
00:43:55,105 --> 00:43:56,172
No, I'm not. I'll go.

648
00:43:56,206 --> 00:43:58,374
It's just
I need some more time.

649
00:43:58,408 --> 00:44:00,842
You're not hearing me,
Agent Schrader.

650
00:44:00,877 --> 00:44:02,977
You're out of time.

651
00:44:03,012 --> 00:44:08,549
Are you going to El Paso
now? Tonight?

652
00:44:12,253 --> 00:44:14,420
Just a simple yes or no.

653
00:44:21,327 --> 00:44:22,527
No.

654
00:44:24,463 --> 00:44:25,663
I can't.

655
00:44:28,666 --> 00:44:31,768
But that's only because

656
00:44:31,802 --> 00:44:33,870
I'm really close
to something big here.

657
00:44:44,579 --> 00:44:46,747
Better get to it, then.

658
00:45:10,867 --> 00:45:14,636
<i>This is KECA 480,
Albuquerque news radio.</i>

659
00:45:14,670 --> 00:45:17,038
