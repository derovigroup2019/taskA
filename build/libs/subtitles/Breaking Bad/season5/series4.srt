1
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:06,716
Gotta say, when you first brought
her in, I had my doubts.

2
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:09,952
But your little darling's got nine lives.

3
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:16,590
Rear-wheel assembly took the brunt
of the impact. So....

4
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:18,353
Yeah.

5
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:21,115
CV shaft, boots, joints, axle....

6
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:23,590
Replaced all of it. No way around it.

7
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:26,470
I went aftermarket
on most of the parts here.

8
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:28,950
You want me to swap in factory parts,
that's fine.

9
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:32,272
But using aftermarket's the only way
we'll keep it under Blue Book...

10
00:00:32,440 --> 00:00:35,160
...and on the insurance company's
dime, okay?

11
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:37,152
Nothing beats free.

12
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:42,114
Swapped out your air filter,
topped off your fluids.

13
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:44,476
Didn't have to replace
the windshield this time.

14
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:46,438
I know, right?

15
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:50,480
Oh, and I noticed you had
some sort of gunky buildup...

16
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:52,154
...in the front end here.

17
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:55,000
First, I had no idea
what I was looking at.

18
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:56,998
Then I remembered
you had me replace...

19
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:01,592
...that front fender a few months back
when you ran over that deer.

20
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:05,231
We went at it with the steam hose,
cleaned it up for you.

21
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:07,960
Hardest part was the paint.

22
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:11,557
Fern green. Interesting tint.

23
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:12,949
Anything else?

24
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:16,318
That's it. Zero balance, like I said.

25
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:18,472
Sign here, you're good to go.

26
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:23,270
People like to joke...

27
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:26,194
...but I really, really like this car.

28
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:28,079
She's sturdy as all hell.

29
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:31,358
I'm betting you get
another 200,000 miles out of her.

30
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,518
Hey, Benny.

31
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,798
What would you give me for it?

32
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:01,031
- What's the Blue Book, you mean?
- No.

33
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:04,558
I mean, what will
you pay me for this car?

34
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:08,279
- Well, I'm not really looking for....
- A hundred dollars?

35
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:11,114
Fifty?

36
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:14,079
Insurance company just shelled out
1900 for the parts alone.

37
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:15,959
Then it's a bargain.

38
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:19,557
You give me 50 bucks,
and she's all yours.

39
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:21,359
You sure about this?

40
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:22,715
Sure as shooting.

41
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:25,318
I'll check the register.

42
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,512
Dad?

43
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:30,320
Fifty bucks? Are you crazy?

44
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:27,638
- Gotta be kidding me.
<i>- Lydia?</i>

45
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,551
Oh, Christ.

46
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,234
I'm at work right now.

47
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:01,840
<i>Yeah, I know.</i>

48
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,798
<i>This is a heads-up. You got visitors.</i>

49
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:07,840
Visitors? What...? You mean today?

50
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,913
<i>I mean 30 seconds.</i>

51
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:17,113
Come in.

52
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:21,156
Ms. Rodarte-Quayle?

53
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:25,799
Agent Hank Schrader,
Agent Steve Gomez, DEA.

54
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:29,032
We met briefly in Albuquerque.

55
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:30,840
Yes, we did.

56
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,117
What can I do for you?

57
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:10,230
There. The foreman.

58
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:13,677
Navy pants, powder-blue shirt.

59
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:26,796
Hey, buddy.

60
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,116
<i>- Yeah?</i>
- They got Ron.

61
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:00,714
Ron's done.

62
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:02,314
<i>Okay.</i>

63
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:04,477
No. No.

64
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:06,632
Not okay, Mike.

65
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,871
Not okay. The....

66
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:14,195
The look he just gave me was
the very antithesis of "okay," okay?

67
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:15,635
<i>Breathe, Lydia.</i>

68
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:17,359
<i>No one's talking to the police.</i>

69
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:20,718
I just had like 14 DEA agents...

70
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:23,554
...barge into my office,
screaming and yelling at me...

71
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:26,792
...and they were swarming
all over the warehouse, okay?

72
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:28,519
The warehouse.

73
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:32,276
Besides, Ron was my guy. Remember?
I don't have a guy anymore.

74
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:35,035
Ron fixed security, pulled the barrels,
drove the truck.

75
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:39,638
You can't expect me to do that stuff.
I mean, let's be realistic.

76
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:46,360
Mike, this is crazy.

77
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:49,157
<i>I'll send a new guy.</i>

78
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:16,035
<i>You're crazy.</i>

79
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:18,112
My car almost has 500 horsepower.

80
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:21,273
- It would totally smoke--
- Horsepower isn't everything.

81
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:22,590
Don't you know that?

82
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:26,913
You have to factor in drag
and torque and suspension...

83
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:28,878
...and weight of the car.

84
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:31,430
One more factor
that you're not thinking about:

85
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:34,069
The experience of the driver.
I totally got you there.

86
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:36,954
- Please. Please. You drive like a geezer.
- I got you.

87
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:38,833
Really? I drive like a gee--

88
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,038
Tell me, can a geezer do donuts?
I don't think so.

89
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:44,795
- Bullshit you ever did donuts.
- Watch your language.

90
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,559
- And, yes, I did.
- Seriously?

91
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,518
Yes, seriously. And if you show me...

92
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:51,036
...just a modicum of respect,
maybe I'll teach you.

93
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:53,874
- Yeah? Yes?
- No. No, I won't. I take that back.

94
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:57,192
- Yes. Yes. No. You're saying yes.
- Just a joke. I'm just....

95
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,794
No! No, no. That was kidding.

96
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:00,997
- We didn't shake on it. No.
- Yes. Yes.

97
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:02,753
- We are now.
- That doesn't count!

98
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:06,271
I know you don't approve.

99
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:10,638
But mine...

100
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,998
...we'll call a birthday present
to myself.

101
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,471
And Junior's....

102
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:22,596
People will just chalk that up
as me being a softy.

103
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:26,433
And besides...

104
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,397
...I didn't actually buy either one.

105
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:33,076
They're both leases.
So it all fits our story.

106
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:35,114
Okay?

107
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:50,392
We can afford it now.

108
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:55,472
You're back at it?

109
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:58,195
Well, yeah.

110
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:02,115
We have to make up
that 600,000 we lost.

111
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:15,515
What do you think
about boarding school?

112
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:18,238
Boarding school?

113
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:20,835
For who? For Junior?

114
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:24,031
Yeah. There's this place
in northern Arizona...

115
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:28,433
...and it's supposed to be
one of the top 10 in the country.

116
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:31,753
He's a year away from college.

117
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:34,594
Why on earth would we do that?

118
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:37,995
I.... I don't know. I just....

119
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:41,036
Just thinking about the kids.

120
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:43,839
Holly too?

121
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,151
Where are we sending
our 8-month-old?

122
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:47,834
Peace Corps?

123
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:52,079
No. I just....

124
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,755
A new environment
might be good for them.

125
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:01,073
What does that mean?

126
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:05,359
What's wrong with their environment?

127
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:09,959
Skyler.

128
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:14,400
What's wrong with their environment?

129
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:18,989
Nothing.

130
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:28,238
Hey.

131
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:34,589
Listen, I know these last few weeks
have been rough.

132
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:39,471
The threat to Hank
and this whole thing with Beneke.

133
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:43,280
But there's absolutely nothing...

134
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:46,114
...for you to be afraid of anymore,
okay?

135
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:49,273
I mean, clear sailing from here on out.
I promise.

136
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:57,832
You know, I want us to try and start
looking forward to things again.

137
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:01,637
Speaking of which, my birthday.

138
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:05,993
I don't know--
I don't know what you have planned...

139
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:09,557
...and with everything
that's been going on lately...

140
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:12,474
...I'd understand if you haven't
even given it a thought.

141
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:15,917
But I think...

142
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:18,675
...a little celebration might be good.

143
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:20,837
For all of us.

144
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,596
You know, a birthday party.

145
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:27,518
What do you think?

146
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:32,359
Yeah?

147
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:34,233
Okay.

148
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:37,194
And maybe, if I may be so bold...

149
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:41,360
...chocolate cake with chocolate icing?

150
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:48,311
Life is good, Skyler.

151
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:10,117
- Thank you.
- Hey, Mom, you forgot something.

152
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:12,553
Dad's bacon.

153
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:13,870
That's okay. I can do it.

154
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:16,600
No. Mom has to.

155
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:22,160
Well, it is sort of a tradition.

156
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:28,600
Watch this, Holly.

157
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:31,070
Watch what she does with bacon.

158
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:33,596
Watch. Watch this.

159
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:38,438
What is she doing?
What is she doing?

160
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:45,317
That's a pretty small "1."

161
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:47,476
Kind of is.

162
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:49,717
Just a little.

163
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:54,677
Now you're talking.

164
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:57,116
- No. No.
- Good move.

165
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:58,555
- No.
- No, no, no. It's good.

166
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:00,279
Very good. Family teamwork.

167
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:03,115
Making sacrifices. Very important.

168
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:05,994
- Happy birthday, Dad.
- Thank you, buddy.

169
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:07,389
You want some?

170
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:09,392
Guy's some piece of work, isn't he?

171
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:13,110
Six feet under and half a face,
he's still screwing with us.

172
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:15,318
So, what's next?

173
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:17,517
I don't know. I don't know.

174
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:19,990
This Madrigal thing seems hinky,
though, you know?

175
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:22,356
We got Burgermeister Meisterburger
in Germany...

176
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:26,678
...and 5000 miles away,
you got this guy.

177
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:30,191
There's gotta be someone in the middle,
you know? Someone we're missing.

178
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:36,399
What about that
Lydia what's-her-name?

179
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:38,114
Lady Banjo Eyes at the warehouse?

180
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:40,556
In this world? No way.

181
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:42,120
Too uptight. Too together.

182
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:43,396
Maybe.

183
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:46,756
She was wearing mismatched shoes.

184
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:48,957
How together can she be?

185
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:55,631
Gentlemen, how goes it with Fring?

186
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:59,198
You know, just working through
the grief.

187
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:02,000
How soon before you submit a final?

188
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:05,275
Well, we've been kicking around
some ideas.

189
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:07,238
Had you asked a couple of weeks ago...

190
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:09,596
...I'd have said
this was a mop-up job, but....

191
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:12,872
- But?
- None of Fring's crew is talking to us.

192
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:15,350
I mean, not a peep,
no matter how hard we squeeze.

193
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:18,029
Makes it likely there's somebody
keeping them in line.

194
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:21,432
Our money is on this guy,
Michael Ehrmantraut.

195
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:24,559
He's Fring's head
of "corporate security."

196
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:27,633
- He's a definite hard case.
- Now, we're gonna stay on him.

197
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:30,634
We're putting together
a surveillance team as we speak. Okay?

198
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,473
The other thing is....

199
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:34,359
This may be unrelated...

200
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:37,752
...but the blue meth is making
a bit of a comeback. Tell him, Gomey.

201
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:40,230
Yeah. Some small amounts
on the street-side pulls.

202
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:42,357
Lab's telling us it's the same stuff.

203
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:44,671
I mean, it could be
old inventory leaking out...

204
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:48,191
...or it could be somebody's rebooting...

205
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:52,149
...using Fring's former cooks
to set up a new operation.

206
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:53,800
I thought we had Fring's cooks.

207
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:56,031
The unsubs in the lab fire.

208
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:58,317
Thought maybe one of them
was your Heisenberg.

209
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:01,917
Yeah. Maybe. I don't know.

210
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:04,834
Like I said,
there's still a lot of questions.

211
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,435
Agent Gomez,
could you give us a moment?

212
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,432
Yeah.

213
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:19,470
Hank, I gotta say,
your work here has been stellar.

214
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:21,518
Really first-rate.

215
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:23,160
Thank you, sir.

216
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:26,552
So much so that I'm wondering
if it's time you made a change.

217
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:29,839
You know I have to get back to El Paso.

218
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,310
This office needs an ASAC...

219
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:34,995
...and I'm thinking we should be
promoting from within.

220
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:37,192
If you were to put in an application...

221
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:40,797
...and I recommend that you do,
you will get the job.

222
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:44,749
I have no doubt this D.O. would be
well served with you at the helm.

223
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:48,433
That's....

224
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:51,354
I'm not sure what to say.

225
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:54,759
It's a big step up.
It's not without its headaches.

226
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:56,877
The politics may take
some getting used to.

227
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:59,350
You'd be overseeing every case
in the office...

228
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:02,752
...so you'd need to reassign
all your day-to-days, Fring included.

229
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:05,630
Much as I hate losing
a good field man...

230
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:08,269
...that's the job,
and you need to be okay with it.

231
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:11,512
What do you say, Hank?

232
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:14,719
You want it?

233
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:21,430
Well, considering my wife
would murder me if I said "no"....

234
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:25,430
Yeah. I want it.

235
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:27,512
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

236
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:41,159
Can you finish up for me?

237
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:43,477
It's.... It's my birthday.

238
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:46,314
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

239
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:51,432
I probably have a birthday party
waiting for me, you know, so....

240
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:54,354
Yeah. Cool. Yeah, no problem.

241
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:57,517
Hey, happy birthday.

242
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:00,192
Thanks. Thanks.

243
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:25,558
- Hey, Dad.
- Hey.

244
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:35,000
Where's your mom?

245
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:36,799
Kitchen.

246
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:44,589
Hey.

247
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:46,672
Oh, hey.

248
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:53,559
So, what's the plan?

249
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:56,439
Hank and Marie are on their way.

250
00:18:56,680 --> 00:19:01,072
Roast chicken and potatoes for dinner,
rocky road for dessert...

251
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:04,910
...and chocolate cake, as requested.

252
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:21,393
What's up?

253
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:23,953
Me?

254
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:25,759
Nothing.

255
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:30,192
Thought you'd be more jazzed
about the new job.

256
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:32,799
No. What...? No. I am.

257
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:35,077
- Baby, I'm so proud of you.
- Yeah, yeah. Okay.

258
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:38,153
- Sorry, sorry.
- I believe you. Just don't kill us here.

259
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:44,958
Marie, you've been moping around
the last few days.

260
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:48,193
Marie?

261
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:51,874
What's up?

262
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:55,869
- Marie, come on.
- I'm sorry. I--

263
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:58,594
I made a promise to someone.

264
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:01,549
To who?

265
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:06,835
- Who?
- Your brother-in-law.

266
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:14,398
- Are you gonna give me a hint at least?
- It involves infidelity. That's all I'll say.

267
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:20,557
Oh, shit. I knew it.

268
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:24,917
Knew what? What did you...?
What did you know?

269
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:28,551
Well, I mean, I didn't know it, but I've
been, you know, saying it forever.

270
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:31,110
Walt's second cell phone, you know?

271
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:34,034
Sorry, babe, but I was way ahead of you
on this one.

272
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:36,793
Way ahead of me.

273
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:41,989
Well, it wasn't Walt.

274
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:47,392
Skyler?

275
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,798
No way.

276
00:20:58,360 --> 00:20:59,350
Hey.

277
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:02,115
- Hey! There she is.
- Hey! Hi!

278
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:03,515
- Hey!
- Hey, buddy.

279
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:07,310
Hey, pal.
Welcome. Welcome. Come on in.

280
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:09,949
Happy birthday. Hi.

281
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:12,277
I'm in the centre lane going about 60.

282
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:15,114
I had no choice but to just tear butt
out of there.

283
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:17,431
So sweet.

284
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:19,592
Highway patrol's
gonna be sweet on it too.

285
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:21,638
Gonna get their ticket quota
in a month.

286
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:24,958
You'll help me out, right, Uncle Hank,
now that you run the DEA?

287
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:28,750
Oh, yeah. For my spoiled-brat,
car-wash-millionaire nephew?

288
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:32,231
Sure. I'll make sure you get
a cell with a view.

289
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:34,035
All right.

290
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:35,998
Well, I'm out of here.

291
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:37,150
Okay.

292
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:39,357
- Happy birthday.
- Thank you, buddy.

293
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:41,637
Congratulations again, Uncle Hank.

294
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:42,790
Thanks.

295
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:45,236
- I'll see y'all later.
- All right.

296
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:46,834
- Bye. Be safe.
- Have fun.

297
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,559
- Drive safely, okay?
- I do.

298
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:51,440
- Slow down.
- Never.

299
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:01,874
A hell of a couple cars there, Walt.

300
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:05,636
Honey, for my next birthday,
I'm gonna take a page here from Walt...

301
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:07,194
...and buy myself a jet plane.

302
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:10,671
Maybe I overdid it a little.

303
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:12,433
But with these new lease rates....

304
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:16,714
I mean, they're mighty attractive. Yeah.

305
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:26,757
Great dinner, Skyler.

306
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:29,754
Those were some bad-ass
whipped potatoes, I'll tell you.

307
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:32,230
You have to tell me
how you get all the lumps out.

308
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:33,595
How do you do that?

309
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:36,632
A potato ricer.

310
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:40,191
A ricer? You don't hand-mash?

311
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:42,954
No.

312
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:54,710
- Well....
- Boy, it has....

313
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:57,873
It has been quite a year, huh?

314
00:22:58,040 --> 00:23:00,191
Do you know that...

315
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:03,194
...it's almost exactly a year ago...

316
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:05,039
...that I got my diagnosis?

317
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:06,839
- Jesus. Yeah, right?
- Yeah.

318
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:10,311
- It seems like longer, doesn't it?
- Yeah. No. It's....

319
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:13,760
One year ago tomorrow.

320
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:16,553
The day after my 50th.

321
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:21,354
Honestly never thought
I'd make it this far.

322
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:25,112
With the cancer and surgery...

323
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:27,954
...and Hank being shot....

324
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:29,554
It just....

325
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:32,231
So many dark days.

326
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:34,313
Well....

327
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:36,836
There's Marie's talking pillow.

328
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,753
Remember that?

329
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:42,073
It was effective.

330
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:45,438
Boy, I did not want
to get any treatment.

331
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:51,278
I think I was too scared...

332
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:53,798
...or too angry or....

333
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:56,873
I don't know. I just wanted to quit.

334
00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:02,554
But you guys....
You got me through it somehow.

335
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:04,799
Kept me going.

336
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:09,958
And that happened again
and again and again.

337
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:12,476
I mean, there were times...

338
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:15,673
...when I was sure I was done for.

339
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:20,799
But then someone or something...

340
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:23,551
...would come through for me.

341
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:27,671
God. And Skyler, I can't--

342
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:31,038
Honey, remember
that first week of chemotherapy?

343
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:33,550
That night on the bathroom floor?

344
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:35,598
What you said to me?

345
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:39,873
I was so sick.

346
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:42,959
It was rough going at first.

347
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:45,517
But Skyler....

348
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:47,911
She was right there, of course...

349
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:50,829
...putting wet washcloths
on my forehead.

350
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,992
And she's singing to me.

351
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:55,959
And this would go on and on...

352
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:58,635
...day after day.

353
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:02,517
And I remember I was lying
on the floor of the bathroom...

354
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:06,959
...because the tile felt
nice and cool, you know?

355
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:09,830
And my head
was in Skyler's lap...

356
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,072
...and I was just asking her...

357
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:16,352
...if this could all be over.

358
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:19,832
It was too hard. It was....

359
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,559
I just wanted it stopped.

360
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:24,713
Skyler, isn't that freezing?

361
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:29,598
Hey-o. Pool party.

362
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:32,433
What are you doing, Skyler?

363
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:35,274
What is she doing? Walt?

364
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:38,080
Hey, Sky,
maybe it's time to get out now.

365
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:39,435
What do you think?

366
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:41,836
Skyler, Hank asked you a question.

367
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,072
You need to get out.... Skyler!

368
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:47,872
She's gonna come up, right?

369
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:49,872
She has to.

370
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:59,153
Skyler!

371
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:16,077
Oh, my God.

372
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:18,709
Wha...? Okay.

373
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:21,998
Okay. It's gotta be....

374
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:27,113
Nope.

375
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:30,636
Okay.

376
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:33,679
Come on!
How am I supposed to--?

377
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:48,393
Hey.

378
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:50,199
Wait.

379
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:53,000
Wait, wait. Who are you?

380
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:55,720
I'm the-- I'm the guy.
So where's the...?

381
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:57,718
Hold on. Hold on.

382
00:26:57,880 --> 00:26:59,837
Who sent you?

383
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,560
Who sent me? Who do you think?

384
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:05,594
No. I'm asking you.

385
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:07,840
Mike.

386
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:11,759
And this Mike person....

387
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:13,479
What's his last name?

388
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:16,712
Lady, I just got off a plane
from New Mexico...

389
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:21,193
...and I got a 900-mile drive back.
That's 14 hours if I don't stop.

390
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:24,910
So the sooner we do this,
the sooner it's done.

391
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:31,952
Ehrmantraut.

392
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:34,914
Okay? Satisfied?

393
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:40,840
<i>Sorry, but I'm not gonna apologise
for being careful.</i>

394
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,231
With all that's been happening,
for all I knew...

395
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:45,357
...you were one
of those undercover people.

396
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:47,477
So, yeah, I'll take paranoid any day...

397
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:50,479
...over getting gang-raped
by prison guards.

398
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:53,235
No doubt. So where's the--?

399
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:56,035
Up there. Number 22356.

400
00:27:56,200 --> 00:28:00,240
That's the one I erased from
the inventory, so it has to be that one.

401
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:02,073
Can you reach it?

402
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:04,875
Yeah, with, like, a forklift.

403
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:06,110
You got one?

404
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:28,795
Wait, wait, wait! Stop!

405
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:35,111
- Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
- What?

406
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:38,637
Please tell me
that's not what I think it is.

407
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:59,080
Has anything like this
ever happened before?

408
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:02,039
No. No, of course not.

409
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:07,069
No, no. I just....

410
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:18,195
She and I have been
having some issues.

411
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:23,714
Yeah, yeah.
I might've heard a little bit about that.

412
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,196
I mean, hey, look,
Marie didn't go into detail.

413
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:30,990
She just, you know, said that,
you know, you guys were...

414
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:34,389
...having some issues.

415
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:39,872
So, what's the next move?

416
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:43,549
Might be good to have her talk
to someone.

417
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:47,280
- I agree.
- Yeah.

418
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:50,353
- I'm gonna get on that first thing.
- Yeah.

419
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:52,830
There's Marie's guy, Dave.

420
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,515
She seems really happy with him.

421
00:29:56,520 --> 00:30:00,480
Not that Marie's an advertisement
for advanced mental health or anything.

422
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:03,553
You know....

423
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:07,509
I just had no idea
she was taking it this hard.

424
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:14,351
Some birthday, huh?

425
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:26,635
She's gonna try and get some sleep.

426
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:28,320
Okay.

427
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:35,991
What was that?

428
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:37,833
I don't know.

429
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:42,075
- I mean, was she trying...?
- No, not in a swimming pool. No.

430
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:45,597
With all of us there?
No, I don't think so.

431
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:49,360
But we both...

432
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:54,239
...think that
she should talk to someone.

433
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:58,033
I'm gonna get you Dave's number.

434
00:30:58,200 --> 00:30:59,714
Okay.

435
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:05,794
Listen, Walt, I....

436
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:10,194
I can't help but sense
that there may be some issues...

437
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:12,670
...between you and Skyler.

438
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:14,832
None of our business, of course.

439
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:17,635
And, Hank, I don't know if you've...

440
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:21,596
- ...picked up on any of the--
- He knows. He knows I know.

441
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:33,158
These things happen in a marriage...

442
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:34,993
...but it isn't unfixable.

443
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:40,795
I think what would be great is if...

444
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,720
...you two had some space...

445
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:46,958
...to work through this stuff.

446
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:48,679
So....

447
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:52,159
And keep an open mind here.

448
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:56,277
What if we took the kids for a while?

449
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:59,750
- Took the kids?
- Absolutely.

450
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:03,800
We'll look after them for a day or two,
or however long...

451
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:06,873
...and leave you and Skyler...

452
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:09,316
...to look after each other.

453
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:11,790
That's very generous of you, Marie...

454
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:16,159
...but I.... I just don't see
how that's a solution.

455
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:17,834
And, I mean--

456
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:22,512
Besides, Junior and Holly,
that's a lot of work.

457
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:24,194
No, it isn't.

458
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:25,555
Junior's independent...

459
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:29,236
...and my niece is only the easiest...

460
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:32,359
...most delicious baby
that was ever born.

461
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:36,070
- It'll be fun, right?
- Yeah. Yeah. No, yeah. Yeah.

462
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:39,199
Absolutely. Yeah. It's a good idea.

463
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:41,920
Well, I think it's a great idea.

464
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:46,160
Just the thing for both of you.

465
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:56,231
Marie, this idea....

466
00:32:57,520 --> 00:32:59,352
Was it yours?

467
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:02,035
Actually, it was Skyler's.

468
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:10,519
She really needs this, Walt.

469
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:14,393
Yep.

470
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:25,834
I gave Marie bottles.

471
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:29,118
They'll stop and pick up diapers
along the way.

472
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:32,159
I spoke with Junior on the phone...

473
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:34,477
...and after much discussion...

474
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:39,192
...he agreed to swing by tomorrow,
pick up some clothes. And so voil?...

475
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:41,671
...the kids are out of this environment.

476
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:43,718
What a coincidence.

477
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:47,436
I know you're awake.

478
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:53,432
What was that about?

479
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:55,557
Can you explain it?

480
00:33:57,560 --> 00:34:00,871
I don't want the children here anymore.

481
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:02,997
It isn't safe.

482
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:08,155
Skyler, we have talked
about this repeatedly.

483
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:09,800
It has never been more safe.

484
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:11,997
"Never been"?

485
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:14,880
A couple weeks ago,
a man was coming to this house...

486
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:17,111
...to kill us,
to murder your entire family.

487
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:20,114
You were in the crawlspace,
screaming.

488
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:21,999
And I dealt with him. It's over.

489
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:23,919
It is not.

490
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:26,191
You're right back
in the meth business again.

491
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:29,512
This is different.
Now I'm running things.

492
00:34:29,680 --> 00:34:32,434
So wait. Now that you're in charge...

493
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:35,672
...it's what? It's gonna be
smooth sailing from here on out?

494
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:37,280
I don't see why not.

495
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:41,275
I keep the work at work, Skyler...

496
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:44,235
...and nothing will ever
impact you or the kids.

497
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:47,279
You don't know that.
You can't make that promise, Walt.

498
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:50,075
I can promise you
that Gus Fring is dead.

499
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:52,516
And he was the threat.
He was the danger.

500
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:55,117
I thought you were the danger.

501
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:05,200
Is that what your pool stunt was about?

502
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:07,556
Trying to protect my children from me?

503
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:09,439
Not just you.

504
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:11,879
There's blood on my hands too.

505
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:14,874
What blood? Beneke?

506
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:17,436
He's in the hospital because of me.

507
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:19,239
- No.
- Because of what I did.

508
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:21,915
Skyler, you can't beat yourself up
over this thing.

509
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:24,834
Please. You didn't set out
to hurt anybody.

510
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,356
You made a mistake,
and things got out of control...

511
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:30,553
...but you did what you had to
to protect your family. I'm sorry.

512
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:33,554
That doesn't make you a bad person,
it makes you a human being.

513
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:37,396
Stop it, Walt. Just stop.

514
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:40,355
I don't need to hear any
of your bullshit rationales.

515
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:41,954
I'm in it now.

516
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:44,311
I'm compromised. But I won't--

517
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:47,473
I will not have my children
living in a house...

518
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:51,350
...where dealing drugs
and hurting people and killing people...

519
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:54,479
...is shrugged off as "shit happens."

520
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:56,552
We're back at it? Fine.

521
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:59,519
But the kids stay away, and that's that.

522
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:01,399
"That's that"? That's what?

523
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:03,392
I got them out of this house.

524
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:06,120
To a sleepover
at their aunt and uncle's?

525
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:07,714
They spend a day or two...

526
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:10,793
...Junior stays up late watching movies,
and then what happens?

527
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:13,680
- We'll see.
- No, I'll tell you what happens.

528
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:17,231
They come home to this house,
to their parents who love them.

529
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:20,080
No. I will not let
our business endanger them.

530
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:21,839
How many times do I have to say...

531
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,798
- ...that they are not in--?
- I said no.

532
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:27,158
I swear to God,
I won't have them back here.

533
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:36,474
What are you gonna do to stop it?

534
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:42,076
Whatever it takes.
Everything in my power.

535
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:44,311
Like what? I mean, specifically.

536
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:46,199
What is your next move?

537
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:48,591
My next move is maybe I hurt myself.

538
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:50,717
Make it clear we need more time.

539
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:53,157
Let Hank and Marie see
we're still struggling.

540
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:57,360
No, more like you're still struggling. So
maybe next time, I have you committed.

541
00:36:57,520 --> 00:37:01,355
Put you in some inpatient facility
while I take care of the kids myself.

542
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:03,716
Is that what you want?

543
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:07,237
So then maybe I show up
with bruises on my neck...

544
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:08,993
...give myself a black eye...

545
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:10,873
...say that you beat me...

546
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:13,675
...when you found out about my lover.

547
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:17,313
I see.

548
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:20,478
So you want to involve Ted?

549
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:21,915
Oh, well, that'll be fun...

550
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:24,549
...bringing the police
up to speed on all of that.

551
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:27,832
But not as much fun as
telling your 16-year-old son...

552
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,595
...that his father is a wife-beater.

553
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:33,150
Also not a very good plan.
What else you got?

554
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:37,711
- I could send Junior away to school.
- Now here's the conversation:

555
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:40,998
"So, honey, I know you've only got
one year left in high school...

556
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:43,595
...but I would love it
if you'd drop everything...

557
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:47,071
...leave all your friends behind,
and go to boarding school in Arizona."

558
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:49,636
You have any other ideas?
Because I'm not hearing...

559
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:51,439
...a solution to your problem.

560
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:56,833
How are you going to save our kids
from this terrible environment?

561
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:58,633
- I don't....
- What are you gonna do?

562
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:01,998
Run off to France? You gonna
close the curtains, change the locks?

563
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:03,992
This is a joke. Come on, Skyler.

564
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:07,471
You wanna take me on?
You wanna take away my children?

565
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:11,474
- What's the plan?
- I don't know!

566
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:14,675
This is the best
I could come up with, okay?

567
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:18,629
I will count every minute
that the kids are away from here...

568
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:20,917
...away from you, as a victory.

569
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:23,598
But you're right.

570
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:26,277
It's a bad plan.

571
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:31,438
I don't have any of your magic, Walt.

572
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:33,080
I don't know what to do.

573
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:35,311
I'm a coward.

574
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:39,396
I-- I can't go to the police.
I can't stop laundering your money.

575
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:41,517
I can't keep you out of this house.

576
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:44,434
I can't even keep you out of my bed.

577
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:48,719
All I can do is wait.

578
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:50,872
That's it. That's the only good option.

579
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:54,636
Hold on, bide my time...

580
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:56,359
...and wait.

581
00:38:58,520 --> 00:39:01,319
Wait for what?
What are you waiting for?

582
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:06,118
For the cancer to come back.

583
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:57,114
Yeah?

584
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:00,839
Okay. Okay.

585
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:03,874
Just relax. I'm coming.

586
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:19,270
Look at that.
You tell me what that looks like.

587
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:22,751
If the DEA's tracking her barrels,
there goes our precursor connection.

588
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:25,276
That's done.
And I'm telling you, these days...

589
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:28,518
...chances of getting a new
methylamine hookup is rare, man.

590
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:30,433
It's like Bigfoot. Like unicorn-rare.

591
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:34,833
Kid, it's just....
You're giving me heartburn here.

592
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:37,709
GPS on the bottom of the barrel.

593
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:40,475
Why didn't they put it inside
where nobody would see it?

594
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:42,359
Look, it's inside, it gets wet.

595
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:44,352
They made these things
to put under cars.

596
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:46,318
It can get wet.

597
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:50,435
Even by cop standards, this is sloppy.

598
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:52,034
And the other barrels...

599
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:54,192
...they have trackers
on the outside too?

600
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:56,795
I don't know. Probably.

601
00:40:58,200 --> 00:41:00,112
You didn't check
any of the other barrels?

602
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:03,352
No. But that's the only one
we could've taken according to her.

603
00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:08,271
Once we spotted it, she freaked out,
I put the barrel back, and we F.O.'d.

604
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:10,312
Let me ask you something.

605
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:12,836
The person who spotted this...

606
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,559
...was it you or was it her?

607
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:17,152
Lydia. She saw it first.

608
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:20,232
Okay.

609
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:21,629
She's dead.

610
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:23,473
Wait, wait, wait. What?

611
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:26,553
Lydia planted this thing, not the cops.

612
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:30,157
She's thinking if she makes it look
like her inventory's being watched...

613
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:33,154
...that we'll leave her alone
and take our business elsewhere.

614
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:34,640
And she's right.

615
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:37,116
We will be taking our business
elsewhere...

616
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:39,590
...right after I leave her alone in a ditch.

617
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:42,320
But wait, hey, if the DEA's
not tracking her stuff...

618
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:45,672
...that's a good thing, right?
I mean, all we gotta do is tell her...

619
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:48,514
...to cut the crap
and keep the methylamine coming.

620
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:50,399
You don't know this woman like I do.

621
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:53,712
I had a chance to deal with this before,
and I gave her a pass.

622
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:55,712
That's what I get for being sexist.

623
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:59,351
- Now, if you'll excuse me....
- Mike, you can't just--

624
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:01,830
Look, that's our precursor.
We need her.

625
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:05,477
Kid, if we have to ramp down
for a while, so be it.

626
00:42:05,640 --> 00:42:09,156
It beats working with a lunatic
who's gonna get us arrested or killed.

627
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:13,758
Look, she didn't seem crazy to me, you
know? She just seemed, like, uptight.

628
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:16,037
And now you're being sexist.

629
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:21,150
Trust me, this woman deserves to die
as much as any man I've ever met.

630
00:42:21,720 --> 00:42:23,154
Wait!

631
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:25,039
Just wait.

632
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:27,237
What if this really was the cops,
you know?

633
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:30,160
- And what if you're wrong about her?
- I'm not wrong.

634
00:42:30,360 --> 00:42:32,670
But what if you are?

635
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:36,550
Jesse, your misgivings
have been duly noted.

636
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:39,280
Now move away from me.

637
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:41,477
No. This is a voting thing.

638
00:42:41,640 --> 00:42:44,633
- I don't think so.
- I vote it's a voting thing.

639
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:47,110
Mr. White, weigh in here, would you?

640
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:48,953
What do you think?

641
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:52,632
Mr. White?

642
00:43:00,680 --> 00:43:03,991
The methylamine keeps flowing,
no matter what.

643
00:43:04,360 --> 00:43:06,920
We are not ramping down.

644
00:43:07,360 --> 00:43:09,591
We're just getting started.

645
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:13,120
Nothing stops this train.

646
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:15,434
Nothing.

647
00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:20,678
Hey, yo, Mr. White. Hold up.

648
00:43:22,320 --> 00:43:25,916
Hey, I just wanted to say
I liked your idea.

649
00:43:26,120 --> 00:43:28,191
You know, it's pretty....

650
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:31,351
I think it's the way to go.

651
00:43:34,360 --> 00:43:36,477
Oh, hey.

652
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:40,270
You said it was your birthday, so....

653
00:43:42,840 --> 00:43:46,629
I left the receipt in the box
in case you wanna exchange it.

654
00:43:48,080 --> 00:43:52,040
Anyway, hey, happy birthday.

655
00:44:07,240 --> 00:44:08,799
Hi.

656
00:44:15,960 --> 00:44:19,192
I stopped by Hank and Marie's.

657
00:44:19,640 --> 00:44:23,475
Junior is still asking,
"What is going on?"

658
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:26,036
Nonstop, very insistently.

659
00:44:26,200 --> 00:44:28,192
But everything's okay.

660
00:44:28,920 --> 00:44:31,230
They're watching <i>Ratatouille.</i>

661
00:44:32,120 --> 00:44:33,918
It's very sweet.

662
00:44:36,040 --> 00:44:37,599
How are you?

663
00:44:45,360 --> 00:44:48,114
There's gonna be some more money
coming in soon.

664
00:44:48,280 --> 00:44:49,873
Is that okay?

665
00:44:52,080 --> 00:44:53,400
Fine.

666
00:44:53,560 --> 00:44:54,960
Good.

667
00:44:58,080 --> 00:44:59,594
So....

668
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:02,632
You coming to bed?

669
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:29,912
I wanna show you something.

670
00:45:32,280 --> 00:45:34,078
See that watch?

671
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:36,677
It was a birthday present.

672
00:45:38,040 --> 00:45:40,794
The person who gave me
this present...

673
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:42,679
...wanted me dead too.

674
00:45:43,840 --> 00:45:45,797
Not that long ago...

675
00:45:45,960 --> 00:45:49,590
...he pointed a gun
right between my eyes, right here...

676
00:45:50,120 --> 00:45:52,589
...and he threatened to kill me.

677
00:45:54,200 --> 00:45:56,954
He changed his mind
about me, Skyler...

678
00:45:58,120 --> 00:45:59,998
...and so will you.
