<i>Previously on AMC's
Breaking Bad...

00:00:08,120 --> 00:00:10,522
<i>Okay, boys! Take it all.
Let's get everything.

Subtitles downloaded from www.OpenSubtitles.org

4
00:00:17,197 --> 00:00:18,201
Put out the lighter.

5
00:00:18,309 --> 00:00:20,267
He can't keep getting
away with it!

6
00:00:20,366 --> 00:00:21,968
He won't.
Do you really want to burn him down?

7
00:00:22,064 --> 00:00:25,029
Let's do it together.
I put a wire on you, let him explain.

8
00:00:25,126 --> 00:00:27,126
If I go to this plaza,
I'm a dead man.

9
00:00:27,234 --> 00:00:29,981
Next time I'm gonna get you
where you <i>really</i> live.

10
00:00:30,223 --> 00:00:31,437
<i>Jesse, listen...

11
00:00:31,706 --> 00:00:34,845
Todd, I think I might have
another job for your uncle.

12
00:00:41,196 --> 00:00:42,913
So, how big's the batch?

13
00:00:42,948 --> 00:00:44,898
Should be about 50 pounds,
give or take.

14
00:00:44,916 --> 00:00:46,834
Uncle Jack, that mask...

15
00:00:46,868 --> 00:00:49,119
I think you should...

16
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:52,423
Mr. White says the fumes
aren't good to breathe.

17
00:00:52,457 --> 00:00:54,258
Let me worry about
what I breathe, kid.

18
00:00:54,292 --> 00:00:56,743
Just hurry this up
so I can grab a smoke.

19
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,968
76%.

20
00:01:38,003 --> 00:01:39,970
- Nice going, nephew.
- Thanks, Uncle Jack.

21
00:01:40,005 --> 00:01:41,455
Where is the blue?

22
00:01:41,473 --> 00:01:42,956
Where's the what?

23
00:01:42,974 --> 00:01:44,458
The blue color.

24
00:01:44,476 --> 00:01:47,094
Does it come later,
when this hardens?

25
00:01:47,128 --> 00:01:49,129
Where is it?

26
00:01:50,181 --> 00:01:53,901
I am correct in assuming
this should be blue?

27
00:01:53,935 --> 00:01:56,904
See, I'm thinking the headline
here should be "76%."

28
00:01:56,938 --> 00:01:59,156
Yeah. Whole lot more
than it was.

29
00:01:59,190 --> 00:02:01,942
That dude who looked like Wolverine--
he couldn't crack 70.

30
00:02:01,976 --> 00:02:03,327
Fine. Yes,

31
00:02:03,361 --> 00:02:06,447
percentage-wise,
it's marginally improved.

32
00:02:06,481 --> 00:02:08,115
And congratulations, Todd.

33
00:02:08,149 --> 00:02:10,817
But blue is our brand.
All over Europe,

34
00:02:10,835 --> 00:02:13,370
it's what our buyers
pay top dollar for.

35
00:02:13,421 --> 00:02:16,040
If we're down a bit in purity
from the Heisenberg days,

36
00:02:16,091 --> 00:02:18,042
maybe they'll let us
slide on that,

37
00:02:18,093 --> 00:02:20,461
but not if it's not blue.

38
00:02:23,181 --> 00:02:24,631
I don't know.
To my eye,

39
00:02:24,665 --> 00:02:26,300
it's kind of blue.

40
00:02:26,334 --> 00:02:27,801
Yeah, a little.

41
00:02:27,835 --> 00:02:29,603
It's blue-ish.

42
00:02:32,223 --> 00:02:34,975
Todd, you're the chef.
What do you think?

43
00:02:40,199 --> 00:02:42,366
Yeah, kinda...

44
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,401
If it catches the light
just right,

45
00:02:44,452 --> 00:02:47,371
I could see how you'd think

46
00:02:47,405 --> 00:02:49,356
there's a touch of blue,

47
00:02:49,374 --> 00:02:51,625
blue-green in there.

48
00:02:51,659 --> 00:02:53,026
Aquamarine.

49
00:02:53,044 --> 00:02:54,528
Hell, we'll put
food coloring in it.

50
00:02:54,546 --> 00:02:56,163
Make it any damn shade
you want.

51
00:02:56,197 --> 00:02:58,532
- Yeah. Like they do farm-raised salmon.
- Yeah.

52
00:02:58,550 --> 00:03:01,831
Jesus, you ever see how pink
they make that crap?

53
00:03:01,866 --> 00:03:03,801
Like, flamingo pink.

54
00:03:04,801 --> 00:03:06,827
It sure as hell don't come
out the ocean lookin' like that.

55
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:13,180
All right.
Let's make some money.

56
00:03:25,393 --> 00:03:29,029
- Here you go, Ms. Quayle.
- Lydia.

57
00:03:29,063 --> 00:03:30,897
Thank you.

58
00:03:37,038 --> 00:03:39,539
Is the tea okay?
I made it just like you asked.

59
00:03:39,574 --> 00:03:40,607
Mm-hmm.

60
00:03:40,625 --> 00:03:42,609
You sure?
If it's too weak or something,

61
00:03:42,627 --> 00:03:44,745
I can go put another bag in it.

62
00:03:44,779 --> 00:03:46,713
I'm sure.

63
00:03:48,716 --> 00:03:51,335
Look, about the product...

64
00:03:51,386 --> 00:03:53,971
I'm really sorry
about the color.

65
00:03:54,005 --> 00:03:56,956
For a minute or two,
it just got a few degrees too hot

66
00:03:56,975 --> 00:03:58,892
in the mixing kettle, I think.

67
00:03:58,926 --> 00:04:01,979
I might've just cooked the
color right out of it.

68
00:04:02,013 --> 00:04:05,265
You burned it, like a cake.

69
00:04:07,151 --> 00:04:09,403
Yeah, sort of, I guess.

70
00:04:09,437 --> 00:04:11,405
But the point is
I think I can fix it,

71
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:14,908
and I think I can bring
the purity up too.

72
00:04:14,942 --> 00:04:16,976
I mean, I'm doing everything

73
00:04:16,995 --> 00:04:20,197
just like Mr. White
taught me, so...

74
00:04:20,248 --> 00:04:23,784
You know,
it's bound to get better, right?

75
00:04:23,818 --> 00:04:26,420
I appreciate you making
every possible effort,

76
00:04:26,454 --> 00:04:27,921
because, as you know,

77
00:04:27,955 --> 00:04:30,490
my buyers expect
a certain threshold,

78
00:04:30,508 --> 00:04:31,925
a continuity.

79
00:04:31,959 --> 00:04:34,177
Yeah. Yeah. Totally.

80
00:04:40,835 --> 00:04:42,335
Uh, about your buyers...

81
00:04:43,838 --> 00:04:47,774
I could ask my uncle
to smooth things over with them,

82
00:04:48,776 --> 00:04:52,362
if... you want.

83
00:04:54,449 --> 00:04:57,984
I'll pass. Thanks.

84
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:01,788
I've put a lot of faith
in your abilities, Todd.

85
00:05:01,823 --> 00:05:04,691
I believe in you.

86
00:05:04,709 --> 00:05:07,527
Please do make the cook better.

87
00:05:07,545 --> 00:05:10,297
It's very important to me.

88
00:05:15,253 --> 00:05:17,637
I've got a flight to catch.

89
00:05:48,252 --> 00:05:49,286
Hello.

90
00:05:49,337 --> 00:05:51,288
<i>Hey. It's Walt.

91
00:05:51,339 --> 00:05:52,956
Hey, Mr. White.
How you doing?

92
00:05:53,007 --> 00:05:54,508
<i>I'm okay.

93
00:05:54,542 --> 00:05:56,259
<i>I, uh...

94
00:05:56,294 --> 00:05:59,262
<i>Todd, I think I might have

95
00:05:59,297 --> 00:06:01,298
<i>another job for your uncle.

96
00:06:01,349 --> 00:06:04,351
Oh, okay. Uh, you want me
to set up a meeting?

97
00:06:04,385 --> 00:06:07,687
<i>I-- Yes. Please.</i>
<i>Let's do that.

98
00:06:07,722 --> 00:06:11,108
Any heads-up
I should give him, like, um,

99
00:06:11,142 --> 00:06:14,761
which jail, how many targets,
stuff like that?

100
00:06:16,697 --> 00:06:18,648
- Mr. White?
<i>- Just one target.

101
00:06:18,699 --> 00:06:21,318
<i>Not currently in jail.

102
00:06:21,369 --> 00:06:23,453
<i>Jesse Pinkman.

103
00:06:23,488 --> 00:06:26,123
You got it.

105
00:07:21,549 --> 00:07:23,458
I'm surprised
you didn't strangle him.

106
00:07:23,551 --> 00:07:25,419
So, now what? Book him?

107
00:07:25,437 --> 00:07:28,588
I'm sure the AUSA have plenty to say
on how to play him against Walt.

108
00:07:28,606 --> 00:07:31,725
Knowing what we know about how
Walt deals with rats behind bars? No...

109
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:33,927
Yeah. Punk has to be safer
with the Marshals watching his back

110
00:07:33,945 --> 00:07:36,339
than out here
where it's open season.

111
00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:37,835
Mmmh...

112
00:07:37,870 --> 00:07:39,433
What does that mean?
What are you thinking?

113
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:42,035
Kid's got an idea.

114
00:07:42,070 --> 00:07:44,455
What kid? That kid?
Timmy Dipshit there?

115
00:07:44,489 --> 00:07:47,124
The one that screwed up our sting?
Oh, I'm all ears.

116
00:07:47,158 --> 00:07:49,443
Just, uh, hear him out,
will ya?

117
00:07:56,918 --> 00:07:59,636
Okay, genius, what's the idea?

118
00:07:59,671 --> 00:08:02,639
You guys need evidence
to put him away,

119
00:08:02,674 --> 00:08:05,476
only he's too smart
to leave any out there, right?

120
00:08:05,510 --> 00:08:06,977
So you say.

121
00:08:07,011 --> 00:08:08,979
Well, I know some evidence

122
00:08:09,013 --> 00:08:11,565
that greedy asshole
would never destroy.

123
00:08:12,633 --> 00:08:14,601
His money.

124
00:08:14,635 --> 00:08:16,970
- You know where he keeps his money?
- No.

125
00:08:16,988 --> 00:08:19,773
But I know someone who might.

126
00:08:25,780 --> 00:08:27,614
Oh, hey.
How'd it go?

127
00:08:27,648 --> 00:08:30,751
Trailed him out to the dog house,
picked him up there.

128
00:08:30,785 --> 00:08:32,953
Seemed to be looking
for someone.

129
00:08:32,987 --> 00:08:34,455
Had a lot of questions.

130
00:08:34,489 --> 00:08:36,457
No calls, though, right?
You got his phone?

131
00:08:36,491 --> 00:08:37,708
Yeah.

132
00:08:39,878 --> 00:08:41,512
He's on ice?

133
00:08:41,546 --> 00:08:43,330
The safe house off Rio Bravo.

134
00:08:43,348 --> 00:08:45,432
I got Van Oster
babysitting him.

135
00:08:45,467 --> 00:08:48,668
Yeah, and what about Van Oster?
Did he have any questions?

136
00:08:48,686 --> 00:08:51,138
Probably, but he knows better
than to ask.

137
00:08:51,172 --> 00:08:52,473
Good job.

138
00:08:52,507 --> 00:08:54,608
I gotta tell you this
up front, Hank.

139
00:08:54,642 --> 00:08:56,860
If this guy decides
that he wants to lawyer up,

140
00:08:56,895 --> 00:08:58,529
I don't care
if you are my boss,

141
00:08:58,563 --> 00:09:00,564
I'm gonna put a stop to this.

142
00:09:00,615 --> 00:09:02,616
He won't lawyer up.

143
00:09:17,665 --> 00:09:19,333
What the hell, man?

144
00:09:20,885 --> 00:09:22,219
Ugh.

145
00:09:40,772 --> 00:09:42,239
You're up.

146
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,334
Hey, there. You mind taking it
outside for a minute?

147
00:09:54,369 --> 00:09:56,703
- No, sir. You got it.
- All right. Thanks.

148
00:09:57,738 --> 00:09:59,906
Huell Babineaux.

149
00:10:01,342 --> 00:10:03,343
Know who I am?

150
00:10:04,712 --> 00:10:06,680
I'll take that as a yes.

151
00:10:06,714 --> 00:10:08,932
Uh, thanks for your patience.

152
00:10:08,967 --> 00:10:11,935
Uh, as, uh, Agent Gomez said,

153
00:10:11,970 --> 00:10:14,304
you're-- you're not
under arrest.

154
00:10:14,355 --> 00:10:15,973
Why am I here?

155
00:10:16,024 --> 00:10:19,109
Well, you're here, uh,
for your own protection, sir.

156
00:10:19,143 --> 00:10:20,611
How you figure that?

157
00:10:20,645 --> 00:10:24,364
Well, we both know how dangerous
my brother-in-law can be.

158
00:10:28,786 --> 00:10:30,704
Nice poker face.

159
00:10:30,738 --> 00:10:32,623
Look, uh, relax.

160
00:10:32,657 --> 00:10:35,275
There's not much new you can
tell me about Walter White.

161
00:10:35,293 --> 00:10:37,277
Multiple murders,

162
00:10:37,295 --> 00:10:39,613
uh, ties to a white power
prison gang,

163
00:10:39,631 --> 00:10:42,299
ran the largest meth racket
in the entire Southwest.

164
00:10:42,333 --> 00:10:45,002
I'm not asking,
you're not answering.

165
00:10:45,053 --> 00:10:47,170
Whoop-de-doo.
Let's cut to the chase.

166
00:10:47,221 --> 00:10:49,222
We have a wire on Walt's phone.

167
00:10:49,257 --> 00:10:51,458
We intercepted a call
between him

168
00:10:51,476 --> 00:10:54,144
and a certain Saul Goodman,
esquire.

169
00:10:54,178 --> 00:10:56,813
You know, your employer.

170
00:10:56,848 --> 00:10:59,900
Anyway, in the call, uh, Walt said
that he was going to, quote,

171
00:10:59,934 --> 00:11:02,569
"Take care of one Jesse Pinkman,"
unquote,

172
00:11:02,604 --> 00:11:04,488
and that you were next
on the hit list.

173
00:11:04,522 --> 00:11:05,822
That's why you're here.

174
00:11:05,857 --> 00:11:08,108
Bullshit.
That don't make no sense.

175
00:11:08,142 --> 00:11:10,644
We got the recording.
I can-- I can let you hear it.

176
00:11:10,662 --> 00:11:13,280
Your associate, Goodman's fixer--
What's his name?

177
00:11:13,314 --> 00:11:15,582
Some carrottop
named Patrick Kuby.

178
00:11:15,617 --> 00:11:18,251
Boston PD ran him out of
Beantown a few years back.

179
00:11:18,286 --> 00:11:19,819
Came out here for the sunshine.

180
00:11:19,837 --> 00:11:23,090
Yeah. Walt said he was gonna do this
Kuby guy the same way he does you.

181
00:11:23,124 --> 00:11:25,292
In fact,
Kuby's already missing.

182
00:11:25,326 --> 00:11:27,294
Sorry to say,
things are looking grim

183
00:11:27,328 --> 00:11:29,162
for your--
your redheaded buddy.

184
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:32,666
Believe us, don't believe us.
Suit yourself.

185
00:11:32,684 --> 00:11:35,185
Whatever you do,
I would not call Goodman.

186
00:11:35,219 --> 00:11:37,170
He sold you
down the river big-time.

187
00:11:37,188 --> 00:11:40,107
- The hell you talkin' about?
- Oh, don't take it personally.

188
00:11:40,141 --> 00:11:43,009
Goodman's next on the chopping block
if he doesn't do what White says.

189
00:11:43,027 --> 00:11:45,345
And to be fair,
your, uh, circus clown of a boss

190
00:11:45,363 --> 00:11:47,364
did try to spare you
for all of, what,

191
00:11:47,398 --> 00:11:49,366
about 15 seconds

192
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:51,351
Before he decided
to help Walt track you down.

193
00:11:51,369 --> 00:11:54,354
You see, Goodman's got
a trace on your phone,

194
00:11:54,372 --> 00:11:56,022
and as soon as you call him,

195
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:58,024
uh, Walt's gonna find out
where you're hiding out.

196
00:11:58,042 --> 00:12:00,544
And then it's just a matter of time
before you end up like this.

197
00:12:02,497 --> 00:12:04,998
Oh, man. Oh, man.

198
00:12:05,032 --> 00:12:07,584
I swear to God, I didn't know
he was gonna kill the man.

199
00:12:07,635 --> 00:12:09,670
I didn't know he was gonna kill him.
I didn't know.

200
00:12:09,704 --> 00:12:11,204
- Relax.
- I didn't know he was gonna kill him.

201
00:12:11,222 --> 00:12:12,723
If we thought you did,
you'd be in lockup

202
00:12:12,757 --> 00:12:14,257
for conspiracy to commit murder

203
00:12:14,308 --> 00:12:15,842
instead of here,
under our protection.

204
00:12:15,876 --> 00:12:17,844
So just tell us everything
you know about White

205
00:12:17,878 --> 00:12:19,346
so we can get him
before he gets you.

206
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:21,348
Why would he wanna kill me?

207
00:12:21,382 --> 00:12:23,684
- I ain't do nothin' to him.
- Who knows with this guy?

208
00:12:23,718 --> 00:12:25,819
From what he said to Goodman,
it may have something to do

209
00:12:25,853 --> 00:12:27,487
with him trying
to tie up loose ends

210
00:12:27,522 --> 00:12:30,190
regarding his poisoning
some kid named Brock.

211
00:12:31,526 --> 00:12:34,411
Or maybe it's 'cause you know
where his money is.

212
00:12:34,445 --> 00:12:36,363
I don't know
where his money is.

213
00:12:36,397 --> 00:12:37,864
That ain't what we heard.

214
00:12:37,898 --> 00:12:40,200
Well, you ain't listening
to the people in the know.

215
00:12:40,234 --> 00:12:42,335
Me and Kuby
rented a van for the dude,

216
00:12:42,370 --> 00:12:45,205
loaded his cash up
in a self-storage unit,

217
00:12:45,239 --> 00:12:47,907
handed over the keys
to him at Goodman's.

218
00:12:47,925 --> 00:12:50,260
And who knows
where he took it from there?

219
00:12:50,294 --> 00:12:53,079
A van, huh?
How much money we talking?

220
00:12:53,097 --> 00:12:55,265
Seven barrels' worth.

221
00:12:55,299 --> 00:12:56,850
Seven barrels?

222
00:12:58,586 --> 00:13:00,604
When you--
you say "barrels,"

223
00:13:00,638 --> 00:13:02,606
you mean <i>barrels</i> barrels?

224
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:04,474
Barrels, man.
You know,

225
00:13:04,525 --> 00:13:07,861
plastic, black,
55-gallon type.

226
00:13:07,895 --> 00:13:09,362
I got 'em at Home Depot.

227
00:13:09,397 --> 00:13:12,032
Filled up every last damn
one of 'em too.

228
00:13:13,034 --> 00:13:15,285
And, uh, where did you
rent the van?

229
00:13:15,319 --> 00:13:16,737
Lariat.

230
00:13:16,771 --> 00:13:19,272
The one on Candelaria
and Monroe.

231
00:13:21,242 --> 00:13:24,110
- Lariat on Candelaria?
- Yeah!

232
00:13:24,128 --> 00:13:26,112
Kuby rented the van.

233
00:13:26,130 --> 00:13:27,831
Mr. White dropped it off.

234
00:13:27,882 --> 00:13:30,300
He had us wash it good
before Kuby took it back.

235
00:13:30,334 --> 00:13:31,885
Wash the rental?
Why?

236
00:13:31,919 --> 00:13:34,721
It was filthy, man,
like he had went off road with it.

237
00:13:34,756 --> 00:13:37,974
After we had hosed it down,
he grabbed a shovel out the back,

238
00:13:38,009 --> 00:13:40,727
handed over the key,
and that was it.

239
00:13:40,762 --> 00:13:42,145
That's all I know.

240
00:13:45,466 --> 00:13:47,851
All right, uh, Mr. Babineaux.

241
00:13:48,853 --> 00:13:50,821
Agent Gomez and I

242
00:13:50,855 --> 00:13:53,490
are going to, uh,
do everything we can

243
00:13:53,524 --> 00:13:55,442
to find the son of a bitch.

244
00:13:55,476 --> 00:13:57,244
Meantime, like I said,
you're free to go.

245
00:13:57,278 --> 00:13:59,830
But if I were you,
I wouldn't take one step out that door.

246
00:13:59,864 --> 00:14:02,499
Right. And
remember, no phone calls.

247
00:14:02,533 --> 00:14:04,284
Oh, almost forgot.

248
00:14:04,318 --> 00:14:06,620
Uh, I took the liberty
of removing the battery

249
00:14:06,654 --> 00:14:08,922
so Walt can't, uh,
track you by GPS.

250
00:14:08,956 --> 00:14:11,842
So don't put that back in.

251
00:14:11,876 --> 00:14:14,127
Agent Van Oster
will stay here with you.

252
00:14:14,161 --> 00:14:16,513
You're in good hands.
He's our best man with a gun.

253
00:14:16,547 --> 00:14:18,832
Uh, however, don't discuss
the case with him,

254
00:14:18,850 --> 00:14:21,501
because the less
you distract him,

255
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:24,187
the better he can protect you.

256
00:14:24,222 --> 00:14:26,356
How long you gonna be?

257
00:14:27,358 --> 00:14:29,643
As long as it takes
to keep you safe.

258
00:14:41,856 --> 00:14:44,291
So just one guy this time.

259
00:14:44,325 --> 00:14:46,576
Not even in lockup.

260
00:14:49,714 --> 00:14:52,499
Some former partner, Todd says?

261
00:14:54,752 --> 00:14:56,052
Yeah.

262
00:14:56,087 --> 00:14:58,338
So what are we talking,
rat patrol?

263
00:15:00,424 --> 00:15:02,142
"Rat p--"

264
00:15:03,144 --> 00:15:04,761
No, no.

265
00:15:04,812 --> 00:15:08,098
"Rat patrol"?
No. No, he's not a rat.

266
00:15:09,383 --> 00:15:11,384
He's just...

267
00:15:12,570 --> 00:15:15,438
He-- he just...

268
00:15:15,489 --> 00:15:17,657
won't listen to reason.

269
00:15:17,692 --> 00:15:19,910
- Okay.
- He's just angry.

270
00:15:19,944 --> 00:15:21,695
He's not a rat.

271
00:15:21,729 --> 00:15:23,730
All right.

272
00:15:24,949 --> 00:15:27,200
Angry, non-rat.
Got it.

273
00:15:27,234 --> 00:15:28,952
How angry we talkin',
by the way?

274
00:15:29,003 --> 00:15:30,904
Like, Hulk angry?

275
00:15:30,922 --> 00:15:35,876
Like, "Rambo James Bond
badass" individual?

276
00:15:39,931 --> 00:15:41,932
Not something
you'd do yourself, huh?

277
00:15:44,051 --> 00:15:46,052
Jesse is like family to me.

278
00:15:47,605 --> 00:15:50,423
Look, I want what you do
to be quick

279
00:15:50,441 --> 00:15:52,091
and painless.

280
00:15:52,109 --> 00:15:54,194
No suffering, no fear.

281
00:15:54,228 --> 00:15:57,364
Bullet to the back of the head.
Something he doesn't see coming.

282
00:15:57,398 --> 00:15:59,282
I respect that.

283
00:15:59,317 --> 00:16:00,984
There's too many savages
out there.

284
00:16:01,035 --> 00:16:02,936
Let's just talk
about the money.

285
00:16:02,954 --> 00:16:05,121
No, we don't want your money.

286
00:16:06,741 --> 00:16:08,375
We want you to cook for us.

287
00:16:17,952 --> 00:16:21,171
You know I'm
out of the business.

288
00:16:21,222 --> 00:16:23,924
Just a couple times
to tutor my nephew here, that's all.

289
00:16:23,958 --> 00:16:27,126
Get him on track
to bringing the purity up.

290
00:16:27,144 --> 00:16:29,796
Get the color right too.

291
00:16:29,814 --> 00:16:32,649
Apparently that blue touch
you put on it--

292
00:16:32,683 --> 00:16:35,101
it's all the craze
with those Slavic types.

293
00:16:35,135 --> 00:16:36,603
So I'm told.

294
00:16:36,688 --> 00:16:39,389
No. Absolutely not.

295
00:16:39,441 --> 00:16:43,310
Look, what was the price
per head last time? I'll triple it.

296
00:16:43,344 --> 00:16:46,814
That's a drop in the bucket compared to
what we aim to earn from the blue stuff.

297
00:16:46,848 --> 00:16:49,516
Don't skimp on family.
That's what I always say.

298
00:16:49,534 --> 00:16:51,235
You want us to do this job?

299
00:16:51,286 --> 00:16:54,238
Do it right?
That's the price.

300
00:17:06,367 --> 00:17:08,335
One cook...

301
00:17:08,369 --> 00:17:11,088
after the job is done.

302
00:17:30,057 --> 00:17:32,225
Time is of the essence.
Do you understand?

303
00:17:32,243 --> 00:17:34,578
We'll do him tonight
if you want.

304
00:17:34,612 --> 00:17:36,613
Just tell me where he is.

305
00:17:36,664 --> 00:17:39,583
I don't know where he is,

306
00:17:41,035 --> 00:17:43,570
but I know how
to flush him out.

307
00:17:47,095 --> 00:17:49,263
You want String Cheese
or Yogurt Squeezers

308
00:17:49,297 --> 00:17:50,765
with your PBJ?

309
00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:52,683
Both.

310
00:17:52,734 --> 00:17:55,686
- I didn't hear you.
- Both, please.

311
00:18:00,526 --> 00:18:02,243
Hold on, honey.

312
00:18:04,312 --> 00:18:05,947
Hi, Andrea.

313
00:18:05,981 --> 00:18:07,665
I don't know
if you remember me.

314
00:18:07,699 --> 00:18:09,917
I'm Walter White,
Jesse's friend.

315
00:18:09,952 --> 00:18:12,003
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, of course. Hi.

316
00:18:12,037 --> 00:18:13,504
Yeah. Oh, hi. Hi.

317
00:18:13,539 --> 00:18:16,541
I'm sorry to just barge in
on you like this,

318
00:18:16,592 --> 00:18:20,344
but, uh, I was hoping that I could
have a moment to talk with you.

319
00:18:20,379 --> 00:18:22,630
It's about Jesse.

320
00:18:22,664 --> 00:18:25,433
Um, okay. Sure. But I'm sort of
rushing around right now.

321
00:18:25,467 --> 00:18:27,468
You wanna talk inside while
I get my boy ready for school?

322
00:18:27,502 --> 00:18:29,136
Uh, well, yeah.
If it's--

323
00:18:29,170 --> 00:18:31,005
if it's okay, yeah, sure.

324
00:18:31,023 --> 00:18:33,007
Thank you.

325
00:18:33,025 --> 00:18:34,942
You met Brock before, right?

326
00:18:34,977 --> 00:18:37,895
Yes. Yes, I have.
At Jesse's.

327
00:18:37,946 --> 00:18:39,697
How you doing, Brock?

328
00:18:42,851 --> 00:18:44,585
Brock, he asked you a question.

329
00:18:44,620 --> 00:18:47,321
- I'm good.
- Good.

330
00:18:47,356 --> 00:18:49,240
Froot Loops.

331
00:18:49,291 --> 00:18:51,626
That's good stuff.

332
00:18:52,911 --> 00:18:54,428
So... Jesse.

333
00:18:54,463 --> 00:18:55,930
Yeah. I--

334
00:18:55,964 --> 00:18:57,665
I don't wanna alarm you,

335
00:18:57,699 --> 00:19:00,334
but I've-- I've been trying
to reach him for days.

336
00:19:00,368 --> 00:19:01,836
I've stopped at his house.

337
00:19:01,870 --> 00:19:04,438
I've left all kinds of messages
on his voicemail,

338
00:19:04,473 --> 00:19:05,940
and he won't return my calls.

339
00:19:05,974 --> 00:19:07,758
I can't find him anywhere.

340
00:19:07,809 --> 00:19:09,710
Have you heard from him?

341
00:19:09,728 --> 00:19:12,212
No, not since the last time
he called to check on Brock.

342
00:19:12,231 --> 00:19:13,731
That was--
I don't know--

343
00:19:13,765 --> 00:19:15,816
two weeks ago, maybe.

344
00:19:16,818 --> 00:19:19,153
Andrea...

345
00:19:19,187 --> 00:19:21,722
Jesse's using again,

346
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:23,658
and I-- I--

347
00:19:23,692 --> 00:19:26,110
I have a bad feeling
about this.

348
00:19:27,946 --> 00:19:29,947
Have you tried
calling the police?

349
00:19:32,751 --> 00:19:34,535
Or, um--
a better idea.

350
00:19:34,569 --> 00:19:37,905
Jesse's lawyer's name is Saul Goodman.
I have his card somewhere.

351
00:19:37,923 --> 00:19:39,707
I mean, he may have ways
of finding Jesse

352
00:19:39,741 --> 00:19:41,425
without, you know,
getting him in trouble.

353
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:44,795
"Better Call Saul."
Yeah. I-- I did that.

354
00:19:44,846 --> 00:19:47,298
He was able to verify
that Jesse's not locked up.

355
00:19:47,349 --> 00:19:51,519
But otherwise,
very little help.

356
00:19:53,272 --> 00:19:55,056
See, the thing is

357
00:19:55,090 --> 00:19:58,309
is that Jesse and I
had this argument recently.

358
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:01,779
And I-- I won't bore you
with the details, but, uh,

359
00:20:01,813 --> 00:20:04,365
he's-- he's--

360
00:20:04,399 --> 00:20:08,402
he's pretty upset
with me, and, uh--

361
00:20:08,436 --> 00:20:11,405
and I'm hoping that's the reason
he hasn't called me back

362
00:20:11,439 --> 00:20:13,207
instead of...

363
00:20:13,241 --> 00:20:15,960
him being...

364
00:20:15,994 --> 00:20:18,012
Well...

365
00:20:20,916 --> 00:20:22,950
Well, I'll try him right now.

366
00:20:22,968 --> 00:20:25,836
I mean, if that's it--
he's mad at you,

367
00:20:25,887 --> 00:20:27,505
maybe I'll have better luck.

368
00:20:27,556 --> 00:20:29,807
That would be such a help. Yes.

369
00:20:29,841 --> 00:20:32,960
What, um-- what-- what number
are you, uh, calling him on?

370
00:20:32,978 --> 00:20:35,146
- Um, his cell.
- Ah. Yeah. You know,

371
00:20:35,180 --> 00:20:37,148
he recently gotten a new one.

372
00:20:37,182 --> 00:20:39,100
And there. That--

373
00:20:39,134 --> 00:20:42,236
that's his new number there--
the highlighted one.

374
00:20:47,009 --> 00:20:49,343
Jesse, hey, it's Andrea.

375
00:20:49,378 --> 00:20:50,845
Your friend Walter
just dropped by.

376
00:20:50,879 --> 00:20:52,880
He's here at the house
with me and Brock right now.

377
00:20:52,914 --> 00:20:55,416
We, uh--
we're thinking of you.

378
00:20:55,450 --> 00:20:57,651
Call me back as soon as
you get this message, okay?

379
00:20:57,669 --> 00:20:59,420
I really need to hear from you.

380
00:20:59,454 --> 00:21:01,505
It's important.

381
00:21:02,657 --> 00:21:04,825
Thank you, Andrea.

382
00:21:04,843 --> 00:21:07,545
I appreciate that.

383
00:21:07,596 --> 00:21:09,880
Well, I better--
I better be going.

384
00:21:09,931 --> 00:21:12,933
Oh, you're welcome to stay a
few minutes to see if he calls back.

385
00:21:12,968 --> 00:21:15,469
No. No, no. You're trying to
get your son off to school.

386
00:21:15,503 --> 00:21:17,888
Listen, if he does happen to
call back, would you call me?

387
00:21:17,939 --> 00:21:19,173
Better yet--

388
00:21:19,191 --> 00:21:22,226
I've got your number.
I'll call you back, okay?

389
00:21:22,277 --> 00:21:24,862
And... thank you.

390
00:21:25,864 --> 00:21:27,481
See ya, Brock.

391
00:21:57,229 --> 00:21:58,712
We on?

392
00:21:58,730 --> 00:22:01,482
Yes. It should be
any time now.

393
00:22:01,516 --> 00:22:03,401
<i>Copy that.

394
00:22:03,435 --> 00:22:06,937
Remember, fast and painless.
And take him away from here.

395
00:22:06,988 --> 00:22:09,957
I don't want the mother
or the boy to know.

396
00:22:09,991 --> 00:22:11,826
<i>You got it.

397
00:22:17,532 --> 00:22:19,533
<i>Jesse, hey, it's Andrea.

398
00:22:19,567 --> 00:22:21,335
<i>Your friend Walter</i>
<i>just dropped by.

399
00:22:21,369 --> 00:22:23,838
<i>He's here at the house</i>
<i>with me and Brock right now.

400
00:22:23,872 --> 00:22:25,906
<i>We, uh--</i>
<i>we're thinking of you.

401
00:22:25,924 --> 00:22:28,075
<i>Call me back as soon as</i>
<i>you get this message, okay?

402
00:22:28,093 --> 00:22:29,877
<i>I really need to hear from you.

403
00:22:29,911 --> 00:22:32,213
<i>It's important.

404
00:22:34,966 --> 00:22:37,268
Nice try, asshole.

405
00:22:53,785 --> 00:22:55,703
How'd it go
at the rental place?

406
00:22:55,737 --> 00:22:57,571
Van have GPS?

407
00:22:57,605 --> 00:22:59,406
No GPS. Nope.

408
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:02,543
They used to have GPS
until about six months ago,

409
00:23:02,577 --> 00:23:05,129
when the ACLU
or somebody sued them,

410
00:23:05,163 --> 00:23:07,465
and they had to get rid of it.

411
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:14,922
Well, that's it.
Game over.

412
00:23:14,956 --> 00:23:17,958
Yo, man, you can't
just give up on this.

413
00:23:17,976 --> 00:23:20,594
- Who said we're giving up?
- What do you got?

414
00:23:20,628 --> 00:23:22,963
Just thinking about
what Babineaux said

415
00:23:22,981 --> 00:23:24,464
about the van being dirty

416
00:23:24,483 --> 00:23:26,851
and the shovel
that Walt had with him.

417
00:23:26,902 --> 00:23:29,303
I'll bet you 10-to-1
he buried that money.

418
00:23:29,321 --> 00:23:31,522
No kidding.
So what?

419
00:23:31,573 --> 00:23:33,524
There's a whole lot
of desert out there.

420
00:23:33,575 --> 00:23:35,192
How are we gonna find
the right spot?

421
00:23:35,243 --> 00:23:37,644
You said it yourself,
there's no GPS on the van.

422
00:23:37,662 --> 00:23:41,198
Yeah. But Walt
doesn't know that.

423
00:23:43,875 --> 00:23:45,909
All right.

424
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:48,245
Here's your change.

425
00:23:48,296 --> 00:23:50,247
- Oh, um, count it out, please.
- Here.

426
00:23:50,298 --> 00:23:52,365
Uh, three.
That makes 15.

427
00:23:52,383 --> 00:23:55,168
Plus five.
That is 20.

428
00:23:55,202 --> 00:23:57,337
Give this to
your car wash professional.

429
00:23:57,371 --> 00:23:58,672
Thank you.

430
00:23:58,706 --> 00:24:00,007
Say it.

431
00:24:00,041 --> 00:24:01,508
Have an A-1 day.

432
00:24:01,542 --> 00:24:03,209
Oh, you too.

433
00:24:04,211 --> 00:24:06,379
- Good.
- Why-- why do I--

434
00:24:06,397 --> 00:24:08,348
why do I gotta say that?

435
00:24:08,382 --> 00:24:10,767
Because it reinforces
our brand.

436
00:24:10,818 --> 00:24:12,853
So, getting the hang of it?

437
00:24:12,887 --> 00:24:15,906
It's, uh-- it's--
it's pretty basic.

438
00:24:17,025 --> 00:24:18,892
Mom, it's Saturday.

439
00:24:19,110 --> 00:24:20,894
Can-- can I go?

440
00:24:20,928 --> 00:24:22,595
- Go where?
- Home.

441
00:24:22,613 --> 00:24:26,066
Um, pick up a few things,
maybe chill for a little bit.

442
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:28,285
I'm sure the smell
is gone by now.

443
00:24:28,319 --> 00:24:31,121
Why don't you just stick around here
for a while longer, all right?

444
00:24:31,155 --> 00:24:33,073
- I need you.
- Hi.

445
00:24:33,107 --> 00:24:35,208
Uh, who do I give this to?

446
00:24:35,243 --> 00:24:37,210
Um, you know what?
I'll take care of it.

447
00:24:37,245 --> 00:24:38,795
Excuse me, son.

448
00:24:38,829 --> 00:24:41,131
That'll be 14.97, please.

449
00:24:46,287 --> 00:24:48,255
Hey. How you doin'?

450
00:24:48,289 --> 00:24:51,258
Y-you're on our billboard.
You're--

451
00:24:51,292 --> 00:24:53,793
- you're the lawyer guy. Yeah.
- "Better call Saul!"

452
00:24:57,798 --> 00:25:00,183
Okay.

453
00:25:00,234 --> 00:25:05,105
So, three makes 15,
and 20, 25, 30,

454
00:25:05,139 --> 00:25:07,440
35, 40, and ten makes 50.

455
00:25:07,474 --> 00:25:08,775
Thank you.

456
00:25:08,809 --> 00:25:10,694
I like your commercial.

457
00:25:10,745 --> 00:25:12,412
What-- what happened
to your face?

458
00:25:12,446 --> 00:25:15,615
Uh, this is a-- I guess you'd call it
an occupational hazard.

459
00:25:15,649 --> 00:25:18,484
Okay, so thank you, and please give that
to your car wash professional.

460
00:25:18,502 --> 00:25:20,870
Very good. Thank you very much.
Good to meet you.

461
00:25:20,922 --> 00:25:22,672
- Yeah.
- Don't drink and drive.

462
00:25:22,707 --> 00:25:25,675
But if you do, call me.

463
00:25:25,710 --> 00:25:28,044
Have an A-1 day.

464
00:25:28,095 --> 00:25:30,330
Mom, you, um--
you forgot to say it.

465
00:25:30,348 --> 00:25:32,882
Yeah. Yeah, I did.
Okay.

466
00:25:34,385 --> 00:25:37,020
Make sure you get in there
between the cushions, all right?

467
00:25:37,054 --> 00:25:40,357
That's it. Way in there.
Attaboy.

468
00:25:41,359 --> 00:25:43,109
What the hell you doing here?

469
00:25:43,144 --> 00:25:45,895
I swear to God, the kid left so much
booger powder in there,

470
00:25:45,947 --> 00:25:47,831
my Caddy is a K-9 unit's
wet dream.

471
00:25:47,865 --> 00:25:50,500
Is your phone broken?
All 200 of them?

472
00:25:50,534 --> 00:25:52,919
Huell's gone.

473
00:25:52,954 --> 00:25:54,838
Huell's gone where?

474
00:25:54,872 --> 00:25:56,790
No idea. AWOL.

475
00:25:56,824 --> 00:25:58,708
Nobody's seen him.
He's not answering his phone.

476
00:25:58,759 --> 00:26:00,660
So what about Jesse?

477
00:26:00,678 --> 00:26:02,662
He hasn't shown up yet.

478
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:05,298
He will, Saul.
He's probably high as a kite somewhere

479
00:26:05,332 --> 00:26:07,217
and hasn't gotten
our message yet.

480
00:26:07,268 --> 00:26:09,886
Or he got it loud and clear
and figured out it's a setup.

481
00:26:09,937 --> 00:26:12,722
The kid is not as dumb
as you think.

482
00:26:18,512 --> 00:26:21,781
Are you wearing
a bulletproof vest?

483
00:26:21,816 --> 00:26:24,517
Did you miss the part about
my bodyguard has gone missing?

484
00:26:24,535 --> 00:26:27,454
Look, I had him
watching the dog house,

485
00:26:27,488 --> 00:26:29,456
figuring the kid might show up
for a fix.

486
00:26:29,490 --> 00:26:31,624
Next thing I know,
radio silence.

487
00:26:31,659 --> 00:26:34,027
You're the math whiz.
Add up two and two.

488
00:26:34,045 --> 00:26:37,080
Jesse is not on
some killing spree.

489
00:26:37,131 --> 00:26:39,132
It's me he wants.

490
00:26:39,166 --> 00:26:40,867
It's just me.

491
00:26:40,885 --> 00:26:42,702
Then where the hell's Huell?

492
00:26:48,559 --> 00:26:50,677
Any news?

493
00:26:50,711 --> 00:26:52,879
Not yet, but soon.
I promise.

494
00:26:52,897 --> 00:26:55,732
- Have an A-1 day.
- Okay.

495
00:27:00,154 --> 00:27:02,572
Next--

496
00:27:02,606 --> 00:27:05,275
inventory lists.

497
00:27:18,739 --> 00:27:21,341
...uh, ten pine-scented
air fresheners.

498
00:27:21,375 --> 00:27:23,409
You mark "ten"
under this column,

499
00:27:23,427 --> 00:27:25,962
and then you subtract ten from
the actual stock column here.

500
00:27:26,013 --> 00:27:27,914
Okay?
Why don't you try that?

501
00:27:38,893 --> 00:27:39,926
Jesse?

502
00:27:39,944 --> 00:27:41,861
<i>Got my photo, bitch?

503
00:27:41,896 --> 00:27:43,863
<i>That barrel look familiar?

504
00:27:43,898 --> 00:27:47,100
<i>'Cause I just found six more</i>
<i>exactly like it.

505
00:27:53,657 --> 00:27:55,942
<i>That big bastard</i>
<i>who works for Goodman--

506
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:58,211
<i>I pistol-whipped</i>
<i>that melon he calls a head

507
00:27:58,245 --> 00:27:59,879
<i>till he gave up what he knew,

508
00:27:59,914 --> 00:28:01,748
<i>which led me</i>
<i>to your rental van,

509
00:28:01,782 --> 00:28:03,783
<i>which, it turns out, had GPS.

510
00:28:03,801 --> 00:28:06,302
<i>How do you like that, genius?

511
00:28:06,337 --> 00:28:08,304
<i>Guess you didn't think</i>
<i>of everything.

512
00:28:08,339 --> 00:28:11,591
Look, Jesse, I don't know what
you plan on doing here, but--

513
00:28:11,625 --> 00:28:14,177
<i>Well, I'll give you</i>
<i>a hint, Walt.

514
00:28:14,228 --> 00:28:16,563
<i>It involves a couple</i>
<i>of five-gallon cans

515
00:28:16,597 --> 00:28:18,398
<i>of gasoline and a lighter.

516
00:28:18,432 --> 00:28:20,850
No, no, no, no, no!
Jesse, please, listen to me.

517
00:28:20,901 --> 00:28:22,435
<i>No, you listen to me, bitch!

518
00:28:22,469 --> 00:28:24,804
<i>You get your ass out here</i>
<i>as fast as you can.

519
00:28:24,822 --> 00:28:26,906
Yes, I'm coming!
Okay? Okay!

520
00:28:26,941 --> 00:28:30,410
<i>And don't even think about
calling anyone for help, all right?

521
00:28:30,444 --> 00:28:32,812
<i>You hang up on me,</i>
<i>put me on hold,

522
00:28:32,830 --> 00:28:34,814
<i>I lose my call for any reason,

523
00:28:34,832 --> 00:28:37,784
<i>as soon as you do,</i>
<i>I'm burning all of it.

524
00:28:37,818 --> 00:28:40,336
<i>All right? One big bonfire.</i>
<i>You get the picture?

525
00:28:40,371 --> 00:28:42,005
I get it.
I get it. Okay.

526
00:28:42,039 --> 00:28:43,506
<i>All right.</i>
<i>Well, you better hurry,

527
00:28:43,541 --> 00:28:45,491
<i>'cause I'm burning</i>
<i>ten grand a minute

528
00:28:45,509 --> 00:28:47,660
<i>till you get here,</i>
<i>starting right now.

529
00:28:47,678 --> 00:28:50,513
I said I'm coming!
Don't you touch my money!

530
00:28:50,548 --> 00:28:52,465
<i>Fire in the hole, bitch.

531
00:28:52,499 --> 00:28:54,217
<i>There goes ten G's.

532
00:28:54,268 --> 00:28:57,554
<i>Aw, nice orange flames.</i>
No. No, no, no, no, no!

533
00:29:00,841 --> 00:29:02,675
Jesse-- Jesse, please.

534
00:29:02,693 --> 00:29:05,812
I'm dying.
My cancer is back.

535
00:29:05,846 --> 00:29:09,348
You're not hurting anyone
but my family. Okay?

536
00:29:09,366 --> 00:29:11,534
Look, I-- I can't
spend this money.

537
00:29:11,569 --> 00:29:14,787
It's not for me.
I won't be around long enough to use it.

538
00:29:14,822 --> 00:29:16,706
It belongs to my children.

539
00:29:16,740 --> 00:29:19,542
<i>Oh, you're gonna</i>
<i>talk about kids.

540
00:29:19,577 --> 00:29:21,244
<i>You're seriously</i>
<i>gonna go there?

541
00:29:22,963 --> 00:29:25,715
I am sorry about Brock.

542
00:29:25,717 --> 00:29:27,667
<i>- No, you're not.</i>
- I am.

543
00:29:27,701 --> 00:29:29,169
<i>You're not,</i>
<i>but you're gonna be.

544
00:29:29,203 --> 00:29:32,371
Yes, I am sorry about Brock!

545
00:29:32,389 --> 00:29:34,307
But he's alive, isn't he?

546
00:29:34,341 --> 00:29:37,093
He's fine,
just as I planned it!

547
00:29:37,144 --> 00:29:40,013
Don't you think I knew
exactly how much to give him?

548
00:29:40,047 --> 00:29:42,015
That I had it all measured out?
Come on!

549
00:29:42,049 --> 00:29:44,567
- Don't you know me by now?
<i>- I know you're a lying,

550
00:29:44,602 --> 00:29:47,053
<i>evil scumbag,</i>
<i>that's what I know.

551
00:29:47,071 --> 00:29:50,073
<i>Manipulating people,

552
00:29:50,107 --> 00:29:51,791
<i>- messing with their heads.</i>
- Open your eyes!

553
00:29:51,825 --> 00:29:55,695
Can't you see that I needed you
on my side to kill Gus?

554
00:29:55,729 --> 00:29:58,114
I ran over those gangbangers!

555
00:29:58,165 --> 00:30:00,917
I killed Emilio
and Krazy-8! Why?

556
00:30:00,951 --> 00:30:03,920
I did all of those things
to try to save your life

557
00:30:03,954 --> 00:30:05,588
as much as mine,

558
00:30:05,623 --> 00:30:07,457
only you're too stupid
to know it!

559
00:30:12,296 --> 00:30:14,380
Jesse...

560
00:30:14,414 --> 00:30:17,250
Jesse!

561
00:30:17,268 --> 00:30:18,935
Jesse, talk to me.

562
00:30:20,638 --> 00:30:22,305
Jesse!

563
00:30:27,261 --> 00:30:29,946
Jesse, I didn't hang up!
Jesse!

564
00:30:42,459 --> 00:30:44,327
Jesse?

565
00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:48,965
Jesse, I'm here.
Where are you?

566
00:31:36,964 --> 00:31:39,332
Son of a bitch.

567
00:31:40,718 --> 00:31:42,852
Son of a bitch.

568
00:31:47,641 --> 00:31:49,642
Son of a bitch!

569
00:32:33,937 --> 00:32:37,056
No. No.
No, no, no.

570
00:33:13,694 --> 00:33:15,144
Come on, come on.

571
00:33:15,195 --> 00:33:17,230
Yes.

572
00:33:21,485 --> 00:33:22,618
Yeah?

573
00:33:22,653 --> 00:33:24,871
It's me.
I've got Jesse in sight,

574
00:33:24,905 --> 00:33:27,290
and he's coming for me
right now.

575
00:33:27,324 --> 00:33:29,909
<i>He knows I'm alone.

576
00:33:29,943 --> 00:33:32,078
<i>I'm guessing he's got backup.

577
00:33:32,112 --> 00:33:35,081
- How many guys?
<i>- I don-- I-- I don't know.

578
00:33:35,115 --> 00:33:38,527
- Where are you?
<i>- Tohajiilee.

579
00:33:38,562 --> 00:33:40,520
<i>Indian reservation,</i>
<i>west of town.

580
00:33:40,555 --> 00:33:42,638
<i>- Get a pen.</i>
- Go.

581
00:33:42,673 --> 00:33:44,757
Okay.

582
00:33:46,093 --> 00:33:48,428
Okay.

583
00:33:48,462 --> 00:33:51,764
"34, 59, 20,

584
00:33:51,798 --> 00:33:55,101
<i>106, 36, 52."

585
00:33:55,135 --> 00:33:57,987
Those are coordinates.

586
00:33:58,021 --> 00:34:00,356
If you<i> want me around</i>
<i>to cook for you,

587
00:34:00,407 --> 00:34:02,024
- you get here right now.
<i>- You got it.

588
00:34:02,075 --> 00:34:04,643
As fast as you can.
Okay. Wait.

589
00:34:05,645 --> 00:34:07,864
They're coming.

590
00:34:07,915 --> 00:34:09,949
It looks like
there could be three men total.

591
00:34:14,838 --> 00:34:16,489
Wait a minute.

592
00:34:16,507 --> 00:34:18,708
What?
What is it?

593
00:34:18,759 --> 00:34:20,927
Stay in the car.

594
00:34:20,961 --> 00:34:24,068
- Oh, my God.
<i>- Walter, what is it?

595
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:29,048
<i>Walter, you still there?

596
00:34:31,456 --> 00:34:32,737
<i>Walter!

597
00:34:37,604 --> 00:34:39,657
<i>Walter, you got eyes on him?

598
00:34:45,045 --> 00:34:47,036
<i>What do you see?

599
00:34:51,498 --> 00:34:53,152
<i>Walter, talk to me.

600
00:34:54,127 --> 00:34:56,128
Forget it.

601
00:34:57,498 --> 00:34:59,382
Don't come.

602
00:34:59,416 --> 00:35:01,050
What do you mean, "Don't come"?

603
00:35:01,084 --> 00:35:02,385
<i>It's off.

604
00:35:03,887 --> 00:35:05,938
Do not come.

605
00:35:31,398 --> 00:35:33,783
Walt!

606
00:35:33,834 --> 00:35:35,901
Come on out!

607
00:35:38,572 --> 00:35:40,406
Walt!

608
00:35:47,130 --> 00:35:49,465
Walt!

609
00:35:49,516 --> 00:35:51,884
I know you're out here!

610
00:35:56,727 --> 00:35:58,418
It's over!

611
00:36:21,810 --> 00:36:23,477
Walt!

612
00:36:25,981 --> 00:36:28,082
Come on out, Walt!

613
00:36:37,492 --> 00:36:39,827
Got him.

614
00:36:57,863 --> 00:37:00,248
Drop it!

615
00:37:08,740 --> 00:37:10,425
Hands up!

616
00:37:17,382 --> 00:37:19,917
Walk towards me slowly!

617
00:37:52,868 --> 00:37:55,119
Stop.

618
00:37:55,170 --> 00:37:57,171
Turn around.

619
00:38:02,261 --> 00:38:05,129
Lace your fingers
behind your head.

620
00:38:07,633 --> 00:38:09,750
Walk backwards to me.

621
00:38:13,755 --> 00:38:15,640
Stop.

622
00:38:15,691 --> 00:38:17,608
Get on your knees.

623
00:38:50,125 --> 00:38:53,127
How'd you like
my barrel photo, huh?

624
00:38:53,145 --> 00:38:55,813
Took it in the backyard
by the barbecue grill.

625
00:38:55,847 --> 00:38:59,483
You know, where we used to
cook out with the family.

626
00:38:59,518 --> 00:39:02,770
Gomie thought the dirt
might not match. But me?

627
00:39:02,804 --> 00:39:04,805
I bet your greedy ass
would be so worked up

628
00:39:04,823 --> 00:39:06,857
about the prospect
of losing your cash

629
00:39:06,909 --> 00:39:08,910
that you wouldn't catch it.

630
00:39:10,162 --> 00:39:12,146
Looks like I was right.

631
00:39:12,164 --> 00:39:14,115
He's clean.

632
00:39:15,500 --> 00:39:17,852
Yo, I remember this place.

633
00:39:17,886 --> 00:39:21,455
The very first place
we cooked, like, ever.

634
00:39:22,708 --> 00:39:26,294
It is, isn't it?

635
00:39:26,328 --> 00:39:29,830
Hey, uh, what say
you save us the busywork, Walt,

636
00:39:29,848 --> 00:39:33,801
and point out the spot
where you buried your money?

637
00:39:37,672 --> 00:39:39,673
No?

638
00:39:39,691 --> 00:39:41,609
No matter.

639
00:39:41,643 --> 00:39:44,729
I'll get a search team out here.
We'll find it.

640
00:39:47,366 --> 00:39:50,368
Agent Gomez,
shall we flip a coin for the honors?

641
00:39:50,402 --> 00:39:52,403
No way, man.
It's all yours.

642
00:39:52,454 --> 00:39:53,520
All right.

643
00:39:54,740 --> 00:39:56,657
Walter White,

644
00:39:56,691 --> 00:39:58,692
you have the right
to remain silent.

645
00:39:58,710 --> 00:40:01,579
Anything you say can
and will be used against you

646
00:40:01,630 --> 00:40:02,997
in a court of law.

647
00:40:03,031 --> 00:40:04,915
You have the right
to speak to an attorney

648
00:40:04,967 --> 00:40:06,834
and have an attorney present
during any questioning.

649
00:40:06,868 --> 00:40:09,086
If you cannot afford
an attorney,

650
00:40:09,137 --> 00:40:11,589
one will be provided for you
at the government's expense.

651
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:15,726
Do you understand these rights
as I have just recited them to you?

652
00:40:17,179 --> 00:40:18,846
Coward.

653
00:40:35,247 --> 00:40:37,114
Back off! Back off!

654
00:40:37,165 --> 00:40:38,532
Get over here!
Get over here!

655
00:40:38,566 --> 00:40:41,035
- Get in the truck!
- Bring it, bitch!

656
00:40:41,069 --> 00:40:42,953
- Put him in the car!
- Come on!

657
00:40:43,005 --> 00:40:45,423
Get in the car!
Hurry up! Get in.

658
00:40:48,743 --> 00:40:51,212
Get in the car, kid.
Come on.

659
00:41:00,689 --> 00:41:02,756
Gonna take him down
for booking, okay?

660
00:41:02,774 --> 00:41:05,559
I think you should stay here
till I come back with a search team.

661
00:41:05,593 --> 00:41:07,561
You got it.
I'd take the kid with me,

662
00:41:07,595 --> 00:41:10,114
but they'd probably
kill each other on the way.

663
00:41:11,650 --> 00:41:15,131
- Congratulations, buddy.
- Hey.

664
00:41:18,874 --> 00:41:21,625
I'll call the Tribal Police on the way out,
let 'em know we're here.

665
00:41:21,660 --> 00:41:24,278
Gonna make a phone call.

666
00:41:40,062 --> 00:41:44,365
Hank, why is there what looks
like brains in our garbage can?

667
00:41:44,399 --> 00:41:46,650
Hey, baby. I got him.

668
00:41:46,685 --> 00:41:48,352
Dead to rights.

669
00:41:49,654 --> 00:41:51,405
You got Walt?

670
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:52,740
<i>Yeah.

671
00:41:52,774 --> 00:41:55,576
<i>I got him in handcuffs</i>
<i>as we speak.

672
00:41:55,610 --> 00:41:59,363
<i>Want me to wave to him</i>
<i>for you? Huh?

673
00:42:02,334 --> 00:42:04,752
Well, he's not, uh--

674
00:42:04,786 --> 00:42:06,787
he's not feeling too friendly.

675
00:42:06,821 --> 00:42:09,823
Oh, my God.

676
00:42:09,841 --> 00:42:12,460
You did it.

677
00:42:12,494 --> 00:42:14,128
Thank God.

678
00:42:14,162 --> 00:42:15,846
<i>Things are gonna be

679
00:42:15,881 --> 00:42:19,400
a little rough for the next couple weeks,
but they'll get better.

680
00:42:24,189 --> 00:42:25,856
Baby, you okay?

681
00:42:28,393 --> 00:42:30,561
I'm much better now.

682
00:42:33,281 --> 00:42:35,316
I gotta go.

683
00:42:35,350 --> 00:42:37,351
It may be awhile
before I get home.

684
00:42:41,523 --> 00:42:43,207
I love you.

685
00:42:44,409 --> 00:42:46,410
I love you too.

686
00:43:15,607 --> 00:43:17,575
Who the hell is this?

687
00:43:17,609 --> 00:43:19,610
Tribal Police?

688
00:43:21,913 --> 00:43:25,366
Hank! Hank! Hank!

689
00:43:42,783 --> 00:43:44,134
No--

690
00:43:52,444 --> 00:43:54,928
Police!
Drop your weapons!

691
00:43:54,946 --> 00:43:58,282
Jack, don't do it!

692
00:43:58,316 --> 00:43:59,900
Jack!

693
00:44:02,604 --> 00:44:05,656
Drop... your... weapons!

694
00:44:05,707 --> 00:44:07,958
You heard the man!
Put 'em down!

695
00:44:07,993 --> 00:44:10,944
How do we know you're cops?

696
00:44:10,962 --> 00:44:13,080
Show us some ID!

697
00:44:13,114 --> 00:44:17,001
Damn straight!
Let's see some badges!

698
00:44:17,052 --> 00:44:18,669
Jack!

699
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:21,788
Jack, don't do it!
Jack!

700
00:44:22,924 --> 00:44:26,594
No, Jack! It's off!
Jack!

701
00:44:26,628 --> 00:44:29,680
We'll give ourselves up
if you show us some badges!

702
00:44:32,484 --> 00:44:34,485
Simple as that!

703
00:44:35,820 --> 00:44:37,821
How 'bout it?

704
00:44:37,856 --> 00:44:39,690
No!

705
00:44:40,742 --> 00:44:42,309
Jack!

706
00:44:42,327 --> 00:44:44,328
Jack!

707
00:44:46,164 --> 00:44:49,316
Jack, it's off!

708
00:44:49,334 --> 00:44:50,784
Forget it!

709
00:44:50,818 --> 00:44:52,486
Jack!
