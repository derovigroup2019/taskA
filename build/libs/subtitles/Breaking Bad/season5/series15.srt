<i>Previously on AMC's
Breaking Bad...</i>

2
00:00:04,477 --> 00:00:06,309
He was out here with those feds...

3
00:00:06,389 --> 00:00:08,740
Shouldn't we maybe find out
what he told them first?

4
00:00:08,823 --> 00:00:09,802
Get out.

5
00:00:09,905 --> 00:00:11,103
Put the knife down, please.

6
00:00:11,210 --> 00:00:12,374
- Get out!
- Ah!

7
00:00:14,669 --> 00:00:15,874
Ahh!

8
00:00:16,545 --> 00:00:18,206
I need the police.
My dad...

9
00:00:22,231 --> 00:00:25,505
<i>You have no right to discuss
anything of what I do.</i>

10
00:00:25,596 --> 00:00:27,169
What the hell do you know
about it anyway?

11
00:00:27,290 --> 00:00:28,532
<i>Nothing!</i>

12
00:00:30,758 --> 00:00:33,924
_

13
00:00:59,215 --> 00:01:01,383
You can come on out.

14
00:01:14,781 --> 00:01:16,732
It's an actual store.

15
00:01:16,783 --> 00:01:18,233
Mm-hmm.

16
00:01:18,284 --> 00:01:21,019
I guess I figured
Vacuum Cleaner Repair

17
00:01:21,037 --> 00:01:22,905
was a term of art.

18
00:01:27,710 --> 00:01:30,746
If you would step right here
on this blue spot.

19
00:01:30,797 --> 00:01:33,332
Leave your luggage
where it is for the moment.

20
00:01:45,711 --> 00:01:47,312
That good?

21
00:01:47,347 --> 00:01:48,313
Sure.

22
00:01:48,348 --> 00:01:49,565
What about this?

23
00:01:49,599 --> 00:01:51,767
I'll Photoshop that out.

24
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:02,661
Oh, Nebraska.
What's in Nebraska?

25
00:02:02,695 --> 00:02:06,248
You. From now on.

26
00:02:06,282 --> 00:02:08,417
It's gonna take me some time

27
00:02:08,451 --> 00:02:09,918
to get your
new situation fixed.

28
00:02:09,953 --> 00:02:11,703
Until then,
you're gonna be staying here.

29
00:02:11,737 --> 00:02:14,506
I got a place downstairs,
out of sight.

30
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:16,758
It's not the Ritz-Carlton,

31
00:02:16,793 --> 00:02:18,576
but it's comfortable enough
for short-term.

32
00:02:18,595 --> 00:02:20,412
How short-term?

33
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:24,466
Considering you got your face up on
buses and billboards all over town,

34
00:02:24,517 --> 00:02:28,270
I'm thinking, uh, two days.

35
00:02:28,304 --> 00:02:31,607
Maybe three.

36
00:02:31,641 --> 00:02:33,442
Only thing is,

37
00:02:33,476 --> 00:02:35,727
and I don't like to do this,

38
00:02:35,761 --> 00:02:39,231
but, uh,
you'll have a bunk mate.

39
00:02:39,265 --> 00:02:42,284
Oh, yeah?
He's still here?

40
00:02:42,318 --> 00:02:44,102
For the moment.

41
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:47,539
He's a special case.
Gonna take some doing.

42
00:02:50,493 --> 00:02:52,995
How's he holding up?

43
00:02:54,613 --> 00:02:57,299
You be the judge.

45
00:03:31,158 --> 00:03:33,910
We will find Hank.

46
00:03:33,944 --> 00:03:35,995
Steve too.

47
00:03:36,029 --> 00:03:38,614
They're out there,
and we're gonna find them.

48
00:03:38,665 --> 00:03:40,700
You have my word.

49
00:03:45,088 --> 00:03:47,006
Sir.

50
00:03:53,514 --> 00:03:56,349
Call it in, get her out of here.
Move.

51
00:04:07,895 --> 00:04:10,696
<i>I, uh, get to his door,</i>

52
00:04:10,731 --> 00:04:13,866
<i>and I could hear music inside.</i>

53
00:04:13,901 --> 00:04:15,985
<i>Like squeaky voices.</i>

54
00:04:16,036 --> 00:04:18,654
<i>And I thought, you know,</i>

55
00:04:18,705 --> 00:04:21,207
<i>maybe, uh...</i>

56
00:04:21,241 --> 00:04:24,043
<i>I knocked on his door.</i>

57
00:04:24,077 --> 00:04:27,446
<i>The music stopped,</i>
<i>and then he was right there.</i>

58
00:04:27,464 --> 00:04:30,883
<i>When he saw the gun,</i>
<i>he thought--</i>

59
00:04:30,918 --> 00:04:32,618
Hey, Kenny.

60
00:04:32,636 --> 00:04:35,922
Does this pussy cry
through the entire thing?

61
00:04:38,976 --> 00:04:41,644
Just watch.

62
00:04:41,678 --> 00:04:42,979
<i>Kept saying that...</i>

63
00:04:43,013 --> 00:04:44,313
<i>You know,</i>
<i>"You don't have to do this."</i>

64
00:04:44,348 --> 00:04:46,148
<i>His eyes were so big.</i>

65
00:04:47,768 --> 00:04:50,519
Such a bitch.
He won't quit.

66
00:04:50,571 --> 00:04:52,021
<i>...high-fiving,</i>
<i>because it worked,</i>

67
00:04:52,072 --> 00:04:54,440
<i>then, you know, we turn around,</i>

68
00:04:54,474 --> 00:04:57,360
<i>and there is this kid</i>

69
00:04:57,411 --> 00:05:00,696
<i>on a dirt bike, looking at us.</i>

70
00:05:02,199 --> 00:05:04,033
<i>Drew Sharp.</i>

71
00:05:04,084 --> 00:05:07,253
<i>That kid that went missing</i>
<i>up in White Horse.</i>

72
00:05:07,287 --> 00:05:09,088
<i>It's him.</i>

73
00:05:09,122 --> 00:05:12,675
<i>And then out of nowhere,</i>

74
00:05:12,709 --> 00:05:17,263
<i>Todd, that opie,</i>
<i>dead-eyed piece of shit,</i>

75
00:05:17,297 --> 00:05:21,384
<i>pulls out a gun</i>
<i>and shoots the kid.</i>

76
00:05:21,435 --> 00:05:23,552
<i>This is Todd Alquist
we're talking about?</i>

77
00:05:23,604 --> 00:05:25,855
<i>He killed Drew Sharp?</i>

78
00:05:25,889 --> 00:05:30,109
<i>Boom.</i>
<i>Like it was nothing.</i>

79
00:05:39,653 --> 00:05:42,622
Hey, Uncle Jack.
Hold up.

80
00:05:45,575 --> 00:05:47,126
I think we should keep him
for a while,

81
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:49,378
get a couple of cooks
under our belt.

82
00:05:49,413 --> 00:05:51,914
You seriously giving me
this turn-the-other-cheek crap?

83
00:05:51,965 --> 00:05:53,582
He ratted you out.
Personally.

84
00:05:53,634 --> 00:05:55,718
We still got 600 gallons
of methylamine.

85
00:05:55,752 --> 00:05:57,920
Meth?
Who gives a shit about meth?

86
00:05:57,971 --> 00:05:58,971
We won the lottery here.

87
00:05:59,006 --> 00:06:02,141
We've got all the money
in the world.

88
00:06:02,175 --> 00:06:04,143
You're talking to me
about selling crank?

89
00:06:04,177 --> 00:06:06,062
I mean, this is
millions, Uncle Jack.

90
00:06:06,096 --> 00:06:07,096
No matter how much you got,

91
00:06:07,147 --> 00:06:09,565
how do you turn
your back on more?

92
00:06:13,654 --> 00:06:17,222
You little...

93
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:19,775
son of a bitch.

94
00:06:22,663 --> 00:06:26,165
It's that Lydia woman.

95
00:06:26,199 --> 00:06:29,251
You're sweet on her,
you little bastard.

96
00:06:29,286 --> 00:06:30,736
Hey, Kenny, you believe this?

97
00:06:30,754 --> 00:06:34,256
Hey, it's all about this
right here, huh?

98
00:06:37,243 --> 00:06:39,011
Come on.

99
00:06:39,046 --> 00:06:40,629
You can do better.

100
00:06:40,681 --> 00:06:42,465
I mean, that one's so uptight,

101
00:06:42,516 --> 00:06:44,266
she's probably got a wood
chipper for a coochie.

102
00:06:44,301 --> 00:06:46,135
You stick it in down there,

103
00:06:46,186 --> 00:06:48,304
you're pulling back a stump.

104
00:06:50,256 --> 00:06:52,808
Ah, what the hell.

105
00:06:52,859 --> 00:06:55,494
Heart wants what
the heart wants, right?

106
00:06:58,598 --> 00:06:59,865
Let's go back
and watch some more

107
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:02,868
of that crybaby rat, huh?

108
00:07:58,058 --> 00:07:59,957
How thick is it?

109
00:08:01,828 --> 00:08:05,097
This is mild steel?

110
00:08:05,132 --> 00:08:07,332
Uh-huh.

111
00:08:07,350 --> 00:08:09,668
Uh, no, this would be cash.

112
00:08:24,534 --> 00:08:26,402
What?

113
00:08:26,453 --> 00:08:28,187
Nothing.

114
00:08:28,205 --> 00:08:30,176
Hey, you know what?

115
00:08:32,075 --> 00:08:33,492
Make yourself useful.

116
00:08:33,526 --> 00:08:36,361
Give me a list
of hitters, mercenaries.

117
00:08:36,379 --> 00:08:39,498
Yes, yes, I remember.
You've got concerns.

118
00:08:39,532 --> 00:08:42,635
Don't worry. We'll take
the time to vet them.

119
00:08:42,669 --> 00:08:47,006
Make sure there are no
undercover cops on the team.

120
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,424
Five should do it.

121
00:08:48,475 --> 00:08:52,561
Providing they're
the right men for the job.

122
00:08:52,596 --> 00:08:54,546
I'm gonna hate
myself for asking,

123
00:08:54,564 --> 00:08:57,650
but, uh, who are we hitting?

124
00:08:59,653 --> 00:09:03,656
Jack Welker.
And his men.

125
00:09:03,690 --> 00:09:06,826
They murdered Hank.
They stole my life's work.

126
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:09,328
I don't know any hit men.

127
00:09:09,362 --> 00:09:12,231
You know a guy who knows a guy.

128
00:09:12,249 --> 00:09:15,417
Just get me the contacts.
Anybody in that world.

129
00:09:15,452 --> 00:09:20,339
I'm paying top dollar.
We'll find them.

130
00:09:20,373 --> 00:09:23,008
You mind if I give you
a nickel's worth of advice?

131
00:09:23,043 --> 00:09:25,410
Just for old time's sake?

132
00:09:25,428 --> 00:09:27,546
You're worried about
your wife and kids?

133
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:29,381
Don't leave.

134
00:09:29,415 --> 00:09:30,933
The way things are right now,

135
00:09:30,967 --> 00:09:32,885
some people, not me, mind you,

136
00:09:32,919 --> 00:09:34,186
but some people might say

137
00:09:34,221 --> 00:09:36,305
you're leaving her
high and dry.

138
00:09:36,356 --> 00:09:39,892
Some people would be
ignorant on the facts.

139
00:09:39,926 --> 00:09:41,760
Some people wouldn't know

140
00:09:41,778 --> 00:09:44,396
that as far as the police
are concerned,

141
00:09:44,430 --> 00:09:46,782
Skyler is a blameless victim.

142
00:09:49,819 --> 00:09:51,537
No, no, no.
Go ahead.

143
00:09:51,571 --> 00:09:54,106
Get it off your chest.

144
00:09:54,124 --> 00:09:55,774
Go on.

145
00:09:55,792 --> 00:09:57,626
The phone call
was a smart move.

146
00:09:57,661 --> 00:09:58,661
Kudos to you.

147
00:09:58,712 --> 00:10:00,412
Odds are it was recorded.

148
00:10:00,446 --> 00:10:01,664
It's gonna play great
for a jury.

149
00:10:01,715 --> 00:10:03,465
It might even
buy her a mistrial.

150
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:05,467
In a year and a half.

151
00:10:05,502 --> 00:10:06,919
Until then,
if they don't have you,

152
00:10:06,953 --> 00:10:07,953
they're going after her.

153
00:10:07,971 --> 00:10:09,805
There's no point.
She knows nothing.

154
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:11,056
Well, too bad for her, then.

155
00:10:11,091 --> 00:10:12,975
She's got nothing to trade.

156
00:10:13,009 --> 00:10:14,593
I hate to be a downer here,

157
00:10:14,627 --> 00:10:16,729
but there are two
DEA agents missing.

158
00:10:16,763 --> 00:10:17,963
Presumed dead.

159
00:10:17,981 --> 00:10:19,815
You think the feds
are gonna just let that go

160
00:10:19,849 --> 00:10:21,183
'cause you hit
the ejector seat?

161
00:10:21,234 --> 00:10:22,651
First thing they're gonna do,

162
00:10:22,686 --> 00:10:25,637
they will RICO your wife
and kids out of the house.

163
00:10:25,655 --> 00:10:27,656
That condo is gone.

164
00:10:27,691 --> 00:10:29,491
Your bank accounts,
they're frozen.

165
00:10:29,526 --> 00:10:31,476
Her picture's probably
on TV right now,

166
00:10:31,494 --> 00:10:32,528
next to yours.

167
00:10:32,579 --> 00:10:33,946
Who's gonna hire her?

168
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:35,080
Money's no problem.

169
00:10:35,115 --> 00:10:37,249
Well, I don't mean
to contradict you,

170
00:10:37,284 --> 00:10:39,585
but getting it to her,
impossible.

171
00:10:39,619 --> 00:10:42,338
The feds are just praying
that you'll make contact.

172
00:10:42,372 --> 00:10:44,506
Internet, the phone--
it's all tapped.

173
00:10:44,541 --> 00:10:47,209
Hey, Mike was no dummy.

174
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:50,262
But every time he tried to get his
nest egg to his granddaughter,

175
00:10:50,297 --> 00:10:54,350
it ended up
in Uncle Sam's pockets.

176
00:10:54,384 --> 00:10:56,885
So you propose what?

177
00:10:58,305 --> 00:11:01,273
Stay. Face the music.

178
00:11:01,308 --> 00:11:05,344
Hey, I mean, how much time
have you got left?

179
00:11:05,362 --> 00:11:07,396
You walk in with
your head held high.

180
00:11:07,447 --> 00:11:08,847
You'll be the John Dillinger

181
00:11:08,865 --> 00:11:10,349
of the Metropolitan
Detention Center.

182
00:11:10,367 --> 00:11:11,516
How bad is that?

183
00:11:11,534 --> 00:11:13,319
And you bring a barrel
full of drug money,

184
00:11:13,353 --> 00:11:16,288
maybe that soothes
some troubled waters.

185
00:11:16,323 --> 00:11:18,657
Maybe they let your family
stay in the house.

186
00:11:18,691 --> 00:11:22,294
After all, the house predates
the criminal enterprise.

187
00:11:22,329 --> 00:11:24,363
God, you think I want to run?!

188
00:11:24,381 --> 00:11:27,333
This is the last thing
that I want.

189
00:11:27,367 --> 00:11:29,468
This-- this changes nothing.

190
00:11:29,502 --> 00:11:33,038
What I do, I do for my family.

191
00:11:33,056 --> 00:11:35,474
My money goes to my children.

192
00:11:35,508 --> 00:11:37,542
Not just this barrel.
All of it!

193
00:11:39,896 --> 00:11:43,349
I'm going to kill Jack
and his entire crew,

194
00:11:43,383 --> 00:11:45,818
and I'm gonna
take back what is mine

195
00:11:45,852 --> 00:11:47,353
and give it to my children.

196
00:11:47,387 --> 00:11:50,489
And then, and only then...

197
00:11:50,523 --> 00:11:52,157
Am I through.

198
00:11:52,192 --> 00:11:54,410
Do you understand?

199
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:59,198
Everything good?

200
00:11:59,232 --> 00:12:01,116
Define "good."

201
00:12:01,167 --> 00:12:04,203
You're set.
Time to go.

202
00:12:04,237 --> 00:12:06,588
You'll be a little longer.

203
00:12:06,623 --> 00:12:08,590
I'm still working
on transportation.

204
00:12:08,625 --> 00:12:10,342
Change of plans.

205
00:12:10,377 --> 00:12:11,593
He's coming with me.

206
00:12:11,628 --> 00:12:13,912
No.
No, that's not--

207
00:12:13,930 --> 00:12:18,467
We're going together.
I can use him.

208
00:12:18,518 --> 00:12:20,886
I'll give you two a minute.

209
00:12:21,888 --> 00:12:23,772
Hey, I'm a civilian.

210
00:12:23,807 --> 00:12:25,107
I'm not your lawyer anymore.

211
00:12:25,141 --> 00:12:27,309
I'm nobody's lawyer.
The fun's over.

212
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:29,778
From here on out,
I'm Mr. Low Profile.

213
00:12:29,813 --> 00:12:31,430
Just another douche bag
with a job

214
00:12:31,448 --> 00:12:32,614
and three pairs of Dockers.

215
00:12:32,649 --> 00:12:33,982
If I'm lucky, month from now,

216
00:12:34,034 --> 00:12:35,200
best-case scenario,

217
00:12:35,235 --> 00:12:37,119
I'm managing
a cinnabon in Omaha.

218
00:12:37,153 --> 00:12:39,371
You're still part of this.
Whether you like it or not.

219
00:12:39,406 --> 00:12:41,824
I'm sorry.
I don't think so.

220
00:12:47,630 --> 00:12:51,417
You remember what I told you?

221
00:12:51,451 --> 00:12:54,503
It's not over.

222
00:12:54,554 --> 00:12:57,723
Unti...

223
00:13:14,774 --> 00:13:17,576
It's over.

224
00:13:59,546 --> 00:14:02,765
Is she even listening?

225
00:14:02,816 --> 00:14:06,152
Mrs. White?

226
00:14:06,186 --> 00:14:08,187
Are you following all this?

227
00:14:08,221 --> 00:14:11,691
Do you understand
what's happening here?

228
00:14:11,725 --> 00:14:14,527
Yes.

229
00:14:14,561 --> 00:14:17,300
I understand.

230
00:14:18,248 --> 00:14:21,915
I understand
I'm in terrible trouble.

231
00:14:22,202 --> 00:14:24,504
I understand that you
will use everything

232
00:14:24,538 --> 00:14:28,124
in your power against me
and my children

233
00:14:28,175 --> 00:14:32,462
unless-- unless
I give you Walt.

234
00:14:32,513 --> 00:14:37,082
But the truth is,
I can't give you what you want.

235
00:14:37,101 --> 00:14:40,303
I don't know where he is.

236
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:51,280
All right, go and discuss this
with your lawyer here.

237
00:14:51,315 --> 00:14:53,299
Rack your brain.

238
00:14:53,633 --> 00:14:57,436
And hope you can come up
with something we can use.

239
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:14,770
<i>4-17?</i>

240
00:15:14,805 --> 00:15:17,356
4-17. No activity.

241
00:16:03,136 --> 00:16:07,356
Ma'am, is there anybody
else in the house?

242
00:16:07,407 --> 00:16:08,974
What about your son?

243
00:16:08,992 --> 00:16:10,943
If I go look in his room,

244
00:16:10,977 --> 00:16:12,912
am I gonna see him?

245
00:16:12,946 --> 00:16:16,282
He's not gonna pop out
and surprise me?

246
00:16:16,316 --> 00:16:18,250
If this guy
takes his hand away,

247
00:16:18,285 --> 00:16:22,154
are you gonna scream?

248
00:16:25,008 --> 00:16:27,009
He's at his friend's house.

249
00:16:27,043 --> 00:16:28,994
He's been there all week.

250
00:16:29,012 --> 00:16:32,131
Please...
Please don't hurt my baby.

251
00:16:32,165 --> 00:16:35,017
- Please-- please.
- Ma'am.

252
00:16:35,051 --> 00:16:38,888
We-- we got a lot
of respect for your husband.

253
00:16:38,939 --> 00:16:42,007
There's just something
that we gotta straighten out.

254
00:16:42,025 --> 00:16:45,528
Okay? We know that you've
been talking to the police,

255
00:16:45,562 --> 00:16:46,729
and that's okay.

256
00:16:46,780 --> 00:16:48,564
You gotta do that.

257
00:16:48,615 --> 00:16:52,184
But you've seen some people.

258
00:16:52,202 --> 00:16:56,705
Like that lady
who came into the car wash.

259
00:16:56,740 --> 00:17:00,075
The one with the black hair.

260
00:17:00,126 --> 00:17:02,694
You said anything about her?

261
00:17:05,549 --> 00:17:09,468
You sure about that?

262
00:17:09,502 --> 00:17:12,054
I didn't.

263
00:17:12,088 --> 00:17:15,341
The police don't need
to know anything about her.

264
00:17:21,765 --> 00:17:24,383
Okay, ma'am, I'm gonna
need you to say it.

265
00:17:24,401 --> 00:17:28,487
I... will... not...

266
00:17:28,521 --> 00:17:33,776
say anything about her.
Ever.

267
00:17:33,827 --> 00:17:35,227
I swear.

268
00:17:41,167 --> 00:17:44,787
Okay.

269
00:17:44,838 --> 00:17:46,171
When we leave,

270
00:17:46,206 --> 00:17:47,539
you're not gonna go

271
00:17:47,573 --> 00:17:51,176
running to those
police officers out front?

272
00:17:51,211 --> 00:17:54,746
No.

273
00:17:58,101 --> 00:18:02,388
Okay. Okay.

274
00:18:04,808 --> 00:18:08,027
'Cause you really
don't want us coming back here.

275
00:18:56,910 --> 00:19:00,412
Don't.
Stay where you are.

276
00:19:00,447 --> 00:19:02,865
We'll talk like this.

277
00:19:05,452 --> 00:19:07,453
Okay.

278
00:19:09,956 --> 00:19:12,091
So that thing
that we talked about,

279
00:19:12,125 --> 00:19:13,676
I went to
Mr. and Mrs. White's house--

280
00:19:13,710 --> 00:19:17,629
You don't...
have to say the name.

281
00:19:19,766 --> 00:19:20,766
Sure.

282
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:22,184
And it went really good.

283
00:19:22,218 --> 00:19:26,188
I mean, the message
was received loud and clear.

284
00:19:27,223 --> 00:19:30,943
The message? Yeah.

285
00:19:30,977 --> 00:19:33,812
Look, I know you did your best.
I just think--

286
00:19:33,846 --> 00:19:35,481
Hi.
What can I get you?

287
00:19:35,515 --> 00:19:37,950
Chamomile tea
with soy milk, please.

288
00:19:37,984 --> 00:19:39,985
And I'll need more stevia.

289
00:19:40,019 --> 00:19:41,954
Sure.

290
00:19:45,241 --> 00:19:49,294
The person we're discussing
saw my face.

291
00:19:49,329 --> 00:19:50,829
You're not Western Union, Todd.

292
00:19:50,863 --> 00:19:55,667
We can't just settle
for you sending messages.

293
00:19:55,701 --> 00:19:56,885
Really, if you'd been there,

294
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:58,921
I think you'd see it different.

295
00:19:58,972 --> 00:20:01,090
We threw a real scare into her.

296
00:20:01,141 --> 00:20:05,877
She seems like a nice lady
watching out for her kids.

297
00:20:05,895 --> 00:20:07,212
So...

298
00:20:07,230 --> 00:20:08,897
You're not going to have
a problem with her.

299
00:20:08,932 --> 00:20:10,382
I can pretty much guarantee it.

300
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:12,434
I wish I had your certainty,

301
00:20:12,485 --> 00:20:14,353
but I'm not like
you and your uncle.

302
00:20:14,387 --> 00:20:18,107
I'm just-- I'm not used
to this kind of risk.

303
00:20:18,158 --> 00:20:20,275
We're gonna have
to take a break.

304
00:20:24,030 --> 00:20:26,782
I-- I have 50 pounds
vacuum packed and ready to go.

305
00:20:26,833 --> 00:20:30,836
And I wish you all the luck
in the world with it.

306
00:20:30,870 --> 00:20:32,788
It's 92%.

307
00:20:35,258 --> 00:20:38,343
I'm sorry?

308
00:20:38,378 --> 00:20:42,264
92%.

309
00:20:42,298 --> 00:20:44,583
Truly?

310
00:20:44,601 --> 00:20:45,584
Tested it twice.

311
00:20:45,602 --> 00:20:49,087
And it's blue.
Just like before.

312
00:20:49,105 --> 00:20:53,976
92.
That's Heisenberg level.

313
00:20:55,361 --> 00:20:57,529
He's not... with you?

314
00:20:57,564 --> 00:21:00,949
Well, next best thing.
Pinkman.

315
00:21:00,984 --> 00:21:03,768
They're looking for Pinkman.

316
00:21:03,787 --> 00:21:05,287
Well, they're not
going to find him.

317
00:21:05,321 --> 00:21:08,240
He's with us,
and he's not going anywhere.

318
00:21:13,546 --> 00:21:15,547
Ms. Quayle, this is what
your guys in Europe

319
00:21:15,582 --> 00:21:18,300
have been begging for, right?

320
00:21:23,306 --> 00:21:28,293
I just think we work together... good.

321
00:21:29,646 --> 00:21:32,764
We make a good team.

322
00:21:32,798 --> 00:21:36,768
I think it's kind of...

323
00:21:36,802 --> 00:21:39,771
mutually good.

324
00:21:41,807 --> 00:21:44,976
92%.

325
00:22:00,660 --> 00:22:03,212
Ugh.

326
00:22:17,610 --> 00:22:21,947
Mr. Lambert,
welcome to New Hampshire.

327
00:22:40,774 --> 00:22:42,641
All right.

328
00:22:42,692 --> 00:22:45,260
Let's have a look
at this place.

329
00:22:45,278 --> 00:22:48,764
You got about a month's
worth of food on hand,

330
00:22:48,782 --> 00:22:50,616
most of it's canned goods,

331
00:22:50,650 --> 00:22:52,985
but there's steaks
in the freezer.

332
00:22:53,036 --> 00:22:55,120
You got a generator outside,

333
00:22:55,155 --> 00:22:56,538
works on LP.

334
00:22:56,573 --> 00:22:58,540
Ought to be enough in the tank

335
00:22:58,575 --> 00:22:59,775
to last out the winter.

336
00:22:59,793 --> 00:23:01,210
It's only 15 amps,

337
00:23:01,244 --> 00:23:02,962
but that ought to do
for the lights,

338
00:23:02,996 --> 00:23:04,797
TV, and the freezer.

339
00:23:04,831 --> 00:23:06,799
That's a wood-burner.

340
00:23:06,833 --> 00:23:09,284
Ought to warm
the place up pretty good.

341
00:23:09,302 --> 00:23:12,137
Plus you can cook on it.

342
00:23:12,172 --> 00:23:13,923
On the TV front,

343
00:23:13,957 --> 00:23:16,225
the reception's
pretty much nil.

344
00:23:16,259 --> 00:23:17,977
You got some mountains
in the way.

345
00:23:18,011 --> 00:23:21,296
Weather's right, you might
be able to catch Montreal,

346
00:23:21,314 --> 00:23:24,299
but mostly you'll be
limited to DVDs.

347
00:23:24,317 --> 00:23:28,737
<i>Mr. Magorium's</i>
<i>Wonder Emporium.</i>

348
00:23:28,772 --> 00:23:30,973
Two copies.

349
00:23:30,991 --> 00:23:34,827
I'm not much of a movie guy.

350
00:23:34,861 --> 00:23:37,696
I'll make a supply run
next month.

351
00:23:37,747 --> 00:23:41,834
You want something else
to watch, put it on the list.

352
00:23:41,868 --> 00:23:43,752
Supply run.

353
00:23:43,787 --> 00:23:47,373
$50,000 for a trip to Costco.

354
00:23:47,424 --> 00:23:48,757
It's risk.

355
00:23:48,792 --> 00:23:51,210
And risk is what
you're paying me for,

356
00:23:51,261 --> 00:23:52,845
not toilet paper.

357
00:23:52,879 --> 00:23:56,682
Risk and a 4,400-mile
round trip.

358
00:23:56,716 --> 00:24:00,836
Mr. Lambert,
my clients and I

359
00:24:00,854 --> 00:24:03,439
don't usually have
an ongoing relationship.

360
00:24:03,473 --> 00:24:06,892
Normally, you and I would have
already gone our separate ways,

361
00:24:06,943 --> 00:24:09,611
but you're you.

362
00:24:12,315 --> 00:24:13,649
Where's the phone?

363
00:24:13,683 --> 00:24:14,950
No phone.

364
00:24:14,985 --> 00:24:19,321
Up here, ice storms
equal service calls,

365
00:24:19,355 --> 00:24:21,957
equal you in cuffs.

366
00:24:21,992 --> 00:24:23,492
Internet?

367
00:24:23,526 --> 00:24:24,827
Same deal.

368
00:24:24,861 --> 00:24:29,415
Also satellite, cable TV,
drop phone, car.

369
00:24:29,466 --> 00:24:33,052
You want news, I'll bring
the Albuquerque papers.

370
00:24:33,086 --> 00:24:34,887
Whatever you need, just...

371
00:24:34,921 --> 00:24:36,055
- put it on the list.
- Put it on the list.

372
00:24:36,089 --> 00:24:37,056
Yeah.

373
00:24:37,090 --> 00:24:41,593
Look,
I have business to conduct.

374
00:24:41,644 --> 00:24:44,880
Your business is your business.

375
00:24:44,898 --> 00:24:48,150
My business is keeping
you out of custody.

376
00:24:48,184 --> 00:24:51,487
You are the target
of a nation-wide manhunt.

377
00:24:51,521 --> 00:24:53,489
Your face is all over TV.

378
00:24:53,523 --> 00:24:56,158
You are the hottest client
I have ever had.

379
00:24:56,192 --> 00:24:58,610
By <i>far.</i>

380
00:24:58,661 --> 00:25:00,579
It stands to reason

381
00:25:00,613 --> 00:25:04,283
you've got to keep
out of sight.

382
00:25:04,334 --> 00:25:07,786
And what's keeping me
from walking out that gate?

383
00:25:07,837 --> 00:25:09,788
Nothing.

384
00:25:09,839 --> 00:25:12,041
There's a little
one-horse town

385
00:25:12,075 --> 00:25:13,675
eight miles down the hill.

386
00:25:13,710 --> 00:25:15,677
There's not a thing
on God's green Earth

387
00:25:15,712 --> 00:25:18,747
that I can do to stop you
going down there.

388
00:25:18,765 --> 00:25:20,415
All I'm saying is,

389
00:25:20,433 --> 00:25:23,385
if you leave this place,

390
00:25:23,419 --> 00:25:26,138
you will get caught.

391
00:25:26,189 --> 00:25:28,357
And, I gotta tell you,

392
00:25:28,391 --> 00:25:32,694
if I find out that
you've left the reservation,

393
00:25:32,729 --> 00:25:34,563
I won't be coming back.

394
00:25:34,597 --> 00:25:36,765
That is for my own safety.

395
00:25:36,783 --> 00:25:40,786
You understand?

396
00:25:40,820 --> 00:25:43,772
Sure.

397
00:25:43,790 --> 00:25:45,273
You know how to work the stove?

398
00:25:45,291 --> 00:25:46,608
- The flue can be tricky.
- Yeah.

399
00:25:46,626 --> 00:25:48,377
I got it.

400
00:25:53,449 --> 00:25:55,384
You paid good money for this.

401
00:25:55,418 --> 00:25:56,835
You got two acres up here,

402
00:25:56,886 --> 00:25:59,121
lots of woods,
nice, warm place.

403
00:25:59,139 --> 00:26:01,473
Seems to me just the spot

404
00:26:01,508 --> 00:26:05,644
for a man to rest up,
think on things.

405
00:26:05,678 --> 00:26:10,799
If you look around,
it's kinda beautiful.

406
00:26:10,817 --> 00:26:14,520
You've been very helpful.
Thank you.

407
00:26:14,571 --> 00:26:16,405
See you in a month.

408
00:27:53,402 --> 00:27:55,254
Tomorrow.

409
00:27:58,508 --> 00:28:00,792
Tomorrow.

410
00:28:49,225 --> 00:28:51,393
Come--

411
00:28:59,319 --> 00:29:02,237
That's not my chocolate
chip, is it?

412
00:29:02,272 --> 00:29:04,573
You're gonna spoil him.

413
00:29:08,828 --> 00:29:10,612
Hey, you awake?

414
00:29:10,646 --> 00:29:13,749
Huh? Yeah.

415
00:29:13,783 --> 00:29:16,752
We had some Ben and Jerry's.

416
00:29:16,786 --> 00:29:22,457
There's peanut butter cup
and "Americone Dream."

417
00:29:22,491 --> 00:29:23,542
I didn't know what you liked,

418
00:29:23,593 --> 00:29:25,510
so I got you some of each.

419
00:29:29,015 --> 00:29:31,300
There you go.

420
00:29:42,395 --> 00:29:47,316
So that batch that you
just cooked was 96%.

421
00:29:47,350 --> 00:29:51,186
Kinda figured you deserved
a little something.

422
00:29:51,204 --> 00:29:54,790
Thanks.

423
00:30:09,055 --> 00:30:12,224
Well, better get some sleep.

424
00:30:12,258 --> 00:30:15,210
Tomorrow's gonna be a big day.

425
00:30:15,228 --> 00:30:16,978
Got a whole new batch.

426
00:30:17,013 --> 00:30:19,097
Hey, um, Todd.

427
00:30:19,148 --> 00:30:20,432
Yeah?

428
00:30:20,483 --> 00:30:25,437
Would you mind, uh,
leaving the tarp off tonight?

429
00:30:25,488 --> 00:30:27,189
Well, might get cold.

430
00:30:27,223 --> 00:30:28,556
No, I-- I don't mind.

431
00:30:28,574 --> 00:30:32,060
I just...
I just wanna see the stars.

432
00:30:35,281 --> 00:30:38,417
Sure. Okay.

433
00:30:38,451 --> 00:30:40,919
Thanks.

434
00:30:42,405 --> 00:30:45,173
Well, goodnight, Jesse.

435
00:30:45,208 --> 00:30:47,592
Night.

436
00:31:45,017 --> 00:31:47,686
Okay. Okay. Okay.

437
00:32:20,636 --> 00:32:23,855
Come on. Bitch.

438
00:33:13,389 --> 00:33:16,825
Go ahead! Do it!

439
00:33:16,859 --> 00:33:19,060
Just kill me now
and get it over with,

440
00:33:19,078 --> 00:33:20,395
because there's no way

441
00:33:20,413 --> 00:33:22,030
I'm doing one more cook

442
00:33:22,064 --> 00:33:24,115
for you psycho fucks!

443
00:33:43,436 --> 00:33:44,719
Yes?

444
00:33:44,753 --> 00:33:46,087
Hi, ma'am.
How you doing tonight?

445
00:33:46,105 --> 00:33:48,256
Um, you're Andrea, right?

446
00:33:48,274 --> 00:33:50,475
How can I help you?

447
00:33:50,526 --> 00:33:53,528
You know Jesse Pinkman?

448
00:33:53,563 --> 00:33:55,263
Right?
Well, I'm a friend of his.

449
00:33:55,281 --> 00:33:56,898
My name's Todd.

450
00:33:56,932 --> 00:33:58,783
I'm sorry to bother you
so late,

451
00:33:58,818 --> 00:34:02,821
but it's nice to meet you.

452
00:34:07,276 --> 00:34:08,994
How is Jesse? Is he okay?

453
00:34:09,045 --> 00:34:10,778
Yeah, he's okay.

454
00:34:10,796 --> 00:34:13,131
Actually,
I brought him with me.

455
00:34:13,165 --> 00:34:14,549
Jesse's here?

456
00:34:14,584 --> 00:34:17,002
Yeah, he's right...
over there.

457
00:34:17,053 --> 00:34:19,087
In that truck.

458
00:34:30,650 --> 00:34:31,983
Where?

459
00:34:34,570 --> 00:34:35,570
No!

460
00:34:40,326 --> 00:34:42,243
Just so you know,
this isn't personal.

461
00:34:43,746 --> 00:34:45,980
No!

462
00:35:05,468 --> 00:35:08,603
Whoa. Hey.
Settle down.

463
00:35:09,939 --> 00:35:12,607
Settle down.

464
00:35:12,642 --> 00:35:14,509
Hey, remember.

465
00:35:14,527 --> 00:35:16,695
There's still the kid.

466
00:36:17,557 --> 00:36:20,058
I brought you a couple
of cases of ensure.

467
00:36:20,076 --> 00:36:21,660
Maybe put a little
weight on you.

468
00:36:21,694 --> 00:36:23,162
Jesus.

469
00:36:23,196 --> 00:36:25,197
I can barely read this.

470
00:36:25,231 --> 00:36:27,332
Ah. Almost forgot.

471
00:36:27,367 --> 00:36:29,234
Without a prescription,

472
00:36:29,252 --> 00:36:31,203
I had to take an educated
guess and shotgun it.

473
00:36:31,237 --> 00:36:32,671
One of these
ought to come close.

474
00:36:32,705 --> 00:36:34,706
Oh.

475
00:36:37,177 --> 00:36:39,094
Did you, uh, check on them?

476
00:36:39,129 --> 00:36:41,079
Is Skyler in a better place?

477
00:36:41,097 --> 00:36:44,466
Nah, she's still at that
place off of Eubank.

478
00:36:44,517 --> 00:36:46,852
Kids are both still
with her for the moment.

479
00:36:46,886 --> 00:36:49,471
Uh, there's no court date yet.

480
00:36:49,522 --> 00:36:52,024
The news was talking
about a grand jury,

481
00:36:52,058 --> 00:36:54,259
but they didn't say when.

482
00:36:54,277 --> 00:36:57,613
I saw her
public defender on TV.

483
00:36:57,647 --> 00:37:00,265
Looks like a deer
in the headlights.

484
00:37:00,283 --> 00:37:04,870
Think I got socks
older than him.

485
00:37:04,904 --> 00:37:07,489
What are they doing for money?

486
00:37:07,540 --> 00:37:10,292
She's doing
taxi dispatch part-time.

487
00:37:10,326 --> 00:37:14,463
Leaves the baby with a
neighbor when she goes in.

488
00:37:14,497 --> 00:37:16,498
I saw her shopping one time.

489
00:37:16,549 --> 00:37:18,217
She looks pretty good.

490
00:37:18,251 --> 00:37:20,836
And she's using
her maiden name.

491
00:37:20,887 --> 00:37:23,222
I wouldn't take that personally

492
00:37:23,256 --> 00:37:24,840
under the circumstances.

493
00:37:24,891 --> 00:37:26,475
Those working for you?

494
00:37:26,509 --> 00:37:28,793
Oh, yeah.

495
00:37:28,812 --> 00:37:31,180
I took a run by your old house.

496
00:37:31,231 --> 00:37:33,148
Uh, the auction's
still pending.

497
00:37:33,183 --> 00:37:35,234
They put a fence up around it.

498
00:37:35,268 --> 00:37:36,485
They put up a fence?

499
00:37:36,519 --> 00:37:37,636
Seems like the place

500
00:37:37,654 --> 00:37:39,738
got to be kind of
a tourist attraction.

501
00:37:39,772 --> 00:37:41,356
Kids breaking in.

502
00:37:41,407 --> 00:37:42,474
The neighbors complained,

503
00:37:42,492 --> 00:37:44,976
so the bank put up a fence.

504
00:37:49,916 --> 00:37:51,250
You ready?

505
00:37:51,284 --> 00:37:53,418
Hmm?

506
00:37:56,339 --> 00:37:58,423
Yeah.

507
00:38:01,261 --> 00:38:04,162
Sorry about last time.

508
00:38:04,180 --> 00:38:06,298
It should go better now.

509
00:38:06,332 --> 00:38:10,168
I watched a couple
of YouTube videos.

510
00:38:10,186 --> 00:38:13,522
It's all about
finding the vein.

511
00:38:13,556 --> 00:38:17,142
Give it to me.
I'll do it.

512
00:38:31,207 --> 00:38:33,659
Here.
You-- you do it.

513
00:38:36,212 --> 00:38:37,696
Big fist.

514
00:38:37,714 --> 00:38:39,079
Tight. There we go.

515
00:38:40,371 --> 00:38:41,755
All right.

516
00:38:41,806 --> 00:38:44,307
It's just...

517
00:38:44,342 --> 00:38:45,809
little stick.

518
00:38:45,843 --> 00:38:47,510
That's it. Okay. Hey.

519
00:38:47,544 --> 00:38:50,347
Pretty good.
There you go.

520
00:38:52,900 --> 00:38:55,769
Think I had worse
my last physical.

521
00:38:59,740 --> 00:39:02,192
I will see you on...

522
00:39:02,226 --> 00:39:04,361
Let's see.

523
00:39:04,395 --> 00:39:08,949
Afternoon of the 15th.

524
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,501
Stay a little longer?

525
00:39:11,535 --> 00:39:16,406
Yeah, I got a long trip
ahead of me.

526
00:39:16,424 --> 00:39:20,093
Two hours?

527
00:39:20,127 --> 00:39:25,081
I'll-- I'll give you
another $10,000.

528
00:39:30,104 --> 00:39:33,440
Please.

529
00:39:35,309 --> 00:39:39,029
$10,000.

530
00:39:39,063 --> 00:39:41,097
One hour.

531
00:39:44,902 --> 00:39:47,871
Cards?

532
00:39:51,659 --> 00:39:55,128
All right, well...

533
00:39:55,162 --> 00:39:59,883
The game will be Seven Card.

534
00:39:59,917 --> 00:40:04,170
I'll deal, since you are...

535
00:40:04,221 --> 00:40:06,289
encumbered.

536
00:40:13,964 --> 00:40:17,984
One of these days
when you come up here...

537
00:40:18,019 --> 00:40:19,602
I'll be dead.

538
00:40:22,806 --> 00:40:25,442
My money over there.

539
00:40:25,476 --> 00:40:29,663
What happens to it then?

540
00:40:29,697 --> 00:40:34,417
What if I ask you
to give it to my family?

541
00:40:41,825 --> 00:40:43,843
Would you do it?

542
00:40:48,215 --> 00:40:51,518
If I said yes...

543
00:40:51,552 --> 00:40:53,887
would you believe me?

544
00:41:04,532 --> 00:41:06,232
You wanna cut the cards?

545
00:41:09,353 --> 00:41:11,187
No.

546
00:41:17,828 --> 00:41:19,496
A king.

547
00:41:19,530 --> 00:41:21,464
Two kings.

548
00:41:27,495 --> 00:41:30,506
_

549
00:44:02,457 --> 00:44:04,625
<i>Flynn White to the
Principal's office, please.</i>

550
00:44:14,319 --> 00:44:16,237
I'm sorry to pull you
out of class.

551
00:44:16,271 --> 00:44:17,938
It's your Aunt Marie.

552
00:44:17,972 --> 00:44:20,474
It sounds very important.

553
00:44:20,492 --> 00:44:22,493
You can take it in here, okay?

554
00:44:22,527 --> 00:44:23,527
Okay.

555
00:44:23,578 --> 00:44:26,364
Here he is.

556
00:44:26,415 --> 00:44:28,115
Thank you.

557
00:44:28,149 --> 00:44:30,334
Hey, Aunt Marie.

558
00:44:30,369 --> 00:44:32,703
Um, what's--
what's going on?

559
00:44:32,754 --> 00:44:34,588
Hold on a sec, honey.

560
00:44:40,829 --> 00:44:43,798
<i>Son, it's me.</i>
<i>Please don't let on.</i>

561
00:44:43,799 --> 00:44:45,099
<i>Carmen's nearby, right?</i>

562
00:44:45,183 --> 00:44:46,717
<i>She cannot know.</i>

563
00:44:46,768 --> 00:44:49,637
<i>Son, are you there?</i>

564
00:44:49,671 --> 00:44:51,939
Ye-- yes.

565
00:44:53,525 --> 00:44:55,943
It's so good
to hear your voice.

566
00:44:59,013 --> 00:45:00,531
I-- I...

567
00:45:00,565 --> 00:45:04,151
I, uh...

568
00:45:04,185 --> 00:45:09,206
Son, the things
that they're saying...

569
00:45:09,241 --> 00:45:12,493
<i>about me...</i>
<i>I did wrong.</i>

570
00:45:12,527 --> 00:45:15,913
<i>I-- I made</i>
<i>some terrible mistakes.</i>

571
00:45:15,964 --> 00:45:20,384
But the reasons were always...

572
00:45:23,839 --> 00:45:26,841
Things happened that...

573
00:45:26,875 --> 00:45:30,210
I-- I never... intended.

574
00:45:30,228 --> 00:45:32,763
I never intended.

575
00:45:37,152 --> 00:45:39,019
Listen.

576
00:45:39,053 --> 00:45:41,655
Son, we don't have much time.

577
00:45:41,690 --> 00:45:46,327
Is Louis' family
still at 4848 Newcombe?

578
00:45:46,361 --> 00:45:49,697
<i>Son, your friend,</i>
<i>Louis Corbett,</i>

579
00:45:49,731 --> 00:45:51,932
<i>does his family still</i>
<i>live in that same place</i>

580
00:45:51,967 --> 00:45:54,402
<i>up on Newcombe?</i>

581
00:45:54,436 --> 00:45:55,436
Ye-- yes.

582
00:45:55,470 --> 00:45:56,570
<i>Okay, good.</i>

583
00:45:56,588 --> 00:45:58,706
Okay,
he's-- he's a good kid.

584
00:45:58,740 --> 00:46:00,458
He's-- he's like you.
He'll understand.

585
00:46:00,509 --> 00:46:03,377
<i>I'm sending Louis a package.</i>

586
00:46:03,411 --> 00:46:07,214
<i>Now, it's addressed to Louis,</i>
<i>but it's for you.</i>

587
00:46:07,248 --> 00:46:11,685
<i>Your mother and your sister.</i>

588
00:46:11,720 --> 00:46:14,772
There's--
there's money inside.

589
00:46:14,806 --> 00:46:20,277
About $100,000.
Okay?

590
00:46:20,312 --> 00:46:22,530
I think.

591
00:46:22,564 --> 00:46:25,983
<i>It was all that</i>
<i>I could fit into the box.</i>

592
00:46:26,034 --> 00:46:27,618
<i>It has to be a secret.</i>

593
00:46:27,652 --> 00:46:29,069
And if anyone says a word,

594
00:46:29,103 --> 00:46:31,288
the police will take it.

595
00:46:41,666 --> 00:46:44,969
<i>I wanted to give you</i>
<i>so much more.</i>

596
00:46:45,003 --> 00:46:47,338
<i>But this is all I could do.</i>

597
00:46:47,389 --> 00:46:49,840
Do you understand?

598
00:46:53,979 --> 00:46:56,514
Son?

599
00:46:56,565 --> 00:46:59,517
Can you hear me?
Do you understand?

600
00:47:02,637 --> 00:47:05,489
You want to send money?

601
00:47:05,524 --> 00:47:07,074
Yes. Good.

602
00:47:07,108 --> 00:47:10,578
Good, good.

603
00:47:10,612 --> 00:47:13,280
So you'll--
you'll talk to Louis, right?

604
00:47:13,314 --> 00:47:15,833
You killed Uncle Hank.

605
00:47:15,867 --> 00:47:16,984
You killed him!

606
00:47:17,002 --> 00:47:19,319
Wait. Wait, son.

607
00:47:19,337 --> 00:47:22,623
No.
What you did to mom-- you asshole.

608
00:47:22,657 --> 00:47:24,175
You killed Uncle Hank.

609
00:47:24,209 --> 00:47:25,793
Listen to me.
You've got to listen to me.

610
00:47:25,827 --> 00:47:27,845
<i>Just shut up.</i>
<i>Just stop it.</i>

611
00:47:27,879 --> 00:47:29,346
Sto-- stop it.

612
00:47:29,381 --> 00:47:31,164
<i>I don't want anything from you.</i>

613
00:47:31,183 --> 00:47:33,184
I don't give a shit.

614
00:47:33,218 --> 00:47:34,518
You need this money.
Your mother--

615
00:47:34,553 --> 00:47:36,053
<i>You killed Uncle Hank.</i>
<i>You killed him!</i>

616
00:47:36,104 --> 00:47:37,771
Your mother needs this money.

617
00:47:37,806 --> 00:47:38,889
It can't all be for nothing.

618
00:47:38,940 --> 00:47:40,474
<i>What you did--</i>
<i>Just shut up.</i>

619
00:47:40,508 --> 00:47:42,342
- Please.
<i>- Shut up.</i>

620
00:47:42,360 --> 00:47:43,394
Please.

621
00:47:43,445 --> 00:47:45,229
<i>Will you just--</i>
<i>just leave us alone.</i>

622
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:47,064
You asshole!

623
00:47:47,115 --> 00:47:50,234
Why are you still alive?

624
00:47:50,285 --> 00:47:52,686
<i>Why don't you just--</i>
<i>just die already?</i>

625
00:47:52,704 --> 00:47:55,039
Just-- just die.

626
00:48:36,230 --> 00:48:37,230
<i>DEA.</i>

627
00:48:37,249 --> 00:48:38,866
<i>Albuquerque District Office.</i>

628
00:48:38,900 --> 00:48:40,534
<i>How may I direct your call?</i>

629
00:48:40,568 --> 00:48:44,705
I'd like to speak
to the agent...

630
00:48:44,739 --> 00:48:49,426
in charge of the Walter
White investigation.

631
00:48:49,461 --> 00:48:55,527
<i>- Who may I say is calling?</i>
- Walter White.

632
00:48:55,578 --> 00:48:59,364
<i>Hello? Hello?</i>

633
00:48:59,415 --> 00:49:04,035
<i>Sir? Sir,</i>
<i>are you still there?</i>

634
00:49:09,992 --> 00:49:14,045
<i>You ready for that drink now?</i>

635
00:49:14,096 --> 00:49:18,300
Dimple Pinch. Neat.

636
00:49:18,334 --> 00:49:20,468
You got it.

637
00:49:41,190 --> 00:49:43,375
Hmm.

638
00:49:52,301 --> 00:49:55,337
<i>For us, it's always</i>
<i>been science first, and--</i>

639
00:49:55,371 --> 00:49:56,704
Wait. Would you--

640
00:49:56,722 --> 00:50:01,443
would you--
would you go back, please?

641
00:50:01,677 --> 00:50:02,844
<i>...more of a byproduct.</i>

642
00:50:02,878 --> 00:50:03,878
- There.
<i>- Exactly.</i>

643
00:50:03,913 --> 00:50:05,046
What, this?

644
00:50:05,080 --> 00:50:06,314
Yes.

645
00:50:06,348 --> 00:50:09,083
<i>But just yesterday,</i>
<i>your charity,</i>

646
00:50:09,118 --> 00:50:11,152
<i>the Gretchen and Elliott
Schwartz Foundation,</i>

647
00:50:11,186 --> 00:50:14,689
<i>announced a $28 million grant</i>

648
00:50:14,723 --> 00:50:17,258
<i>for drug abuse</i>
<i>treatment centers</i>

649
00:50:17,293 --> 00:50:19,160
<i>throughout the Southwest.</i>

650
00:50:19,194 --> 00:50:21,229
<i>Charlie,</i>
<i>the Southwest is our home,</i>

651
00:50:21,263 --> 00:50:23,264
<i>and we couldn't just ignore</i>

652
00:50:23,299 --> 00:50:25,366
<i>what's going on</i>
<i>in our own backyard.</i>

653
00:50:25,401 --> 00:50:26,801
<i>But I'm sure you're aware</i>

654
00:50:26,835 --> 00:50:28,870
<i>that there are people</i>
<i>who suggest other motives.</i>

655
00:50:28,904 --> 00:50:31,773
<i>Andrew Ross Sorkin</i>
<i>of</i> The New York Times

656
00:50:31,807 --> 00:50:34,576
<i>wrote a column suggesting</i>

657
00:50:34,610 --> 00:50:39,013
<i>that the grant was a kind</i>
<i>of publicity maneuver</i>

658
00:50:39,048 --> 00:50:42,650
<i>to sure up the stock price</i>
<i>of Gray Matter Technologies</i>

659
00:50:42,685 --> 00:50:47,989
<i>because of your association</i>
<i>with Walter White.</i>

660
00:50:48,023 --> 00:50:49,457
<i>Well, that's not</i>
<i>exactly the way--</i>

661
00:50:49,491 --> 00:50:51,359
<i>To cleanse yourselves,</i>
<i>so to speak,</i>

662
00:50:51,393 --> 00:50:54,662
<i>of having</i>
<i>a methamphetamine kingpin</i>

663
00:50:54,697 --> 00:50:57,665
<i>as cofounder of your company.</i>

664
00:50:57,700 --> 00:50:59,300
<i>Charlie, I'm glad</i>
<i>you brought that up.</i>

665
00:50:59,335 --> 00:51:02,537
<i>I have to believe</i>
<i>that the investing public</i>

666
00:51:02,571 --> 00:51:04,405
<i>understands we're talking</i>
<i>about a person</i>

667
00:51:04,440 --> 00:51:06,407
<i>who-- who was there early on,</i>

668
00:51:06,442 --> 00:51:07,642
<i>but who had virtually</i>

669
00:51:07,676 --> 00:51:09,477
<i>nothing to do with</i>
<i>the creation of the company,</i>

670
00:51:09,511 --> 00:51:10,645
<i>and still less to do</i>

671
00:51:10,679 --> 00:51:12,246
<i>with growing it</i>
<i>into what it is today.</i>

672
00:51:12,281 --> 00:51:15,583
<i>So what was Walter White's</i>
<i>contribution?</i>

673
00:51:15,618 --> 00:51:19,687
<i>You know, to be honest...</i>
<i>Honey?</i>

674
00:51:19,722 --> 00:51:21,823
<i>- The company name.</i>
<i>- The company name.</i>

675
00:51:21,857 --> 00:51:24,692
<i>We came up with it</i>
<i>by combining our names.</i>

676
00:51:24,727 --> 00:51:26,160
<i>Uh, "Schwartz" means black,</i>

677
00:51:26,195 --> 00:51:27,795
<i>black plus White makes gray.</i>

678
00:51:27,830 --> 00:51:29,530
<i>It's Gray Matter Technologies.</i>

679
00:51:29,565 --> 00:51:31,432
<i>Exactly.</i>
<i>As far as I can recall,</i>

680
00:51:31,467 --> 00:51:33,835
<i>his contribution begins</i>
<i>and ends right there.</i>

681
00:51:33,869 --> 00:51:35,603
<i>There are continuing reports</i>

682
00:51:35,638 --> 00:51:37,372
<i>of blue methamphetamine,</i>

683
00:51:37,406 --> 00:51:40,775
<i>considered his signature product</i>
<i>throughout the Southwest,</i>

684
00:51:40,809 --> 00:51:44,212
<i>and some evidence</i>
<i>of reaching as far as Europe.</i>

685
00:51:44,246 --> 00:51:45,913
<i>So my question is,</i>

686
00:51:45,948 --> 00:51:48,983
<i>is Walter White</i>
<i>still out there?</i>

687
00:51:49,018 --> 00:51:51,085
<i>No, he's not.</i>

688
00:51:51,120 --> 00:51:54,822
<i>You sound very sure.</i>

689
00:51:54,857 --> 00:51:56,090
<i>I am.</i>

690
00:51:56,125 --> 00:51:58,826
<i>I can't speak</i>
<i>to this Heisenberg</i>

691
00:51:58,861 --> 00:52:01,396
<i>that people refer to,</i>

692
00:52:01,430 --> 00:52:04,098
<i>but whatever--</i>

693
00:52:04,133 --> 00:52:05,533
<i>whatever he became,</i>

694
00:52:05,567 --> 00:52:08,369
<i>the-- the sweet, kind,</i>
<i>brilliant man</i>

695
00:52:08,404 --> 00:52:12,273
<i>that we once knew,</i>
<i>long ago, he's gone.</i>

696
00:52:12,307 --> 00:52:14,375
<i>But to be absolutely clear...</i>

697
00:52:42,004 --> 00:52:43,004
Police. Hands.

698
00:52:43,038 --> 00:52:44,038
Show us your hands.

699
00:52:44,072 --> 00:52:46,090
Show me your hands.
