1
00:00:03,684 --> 00:00:05,417
Now why aren't we exploiting that?

2
00:00:05,585 --> 00:00:07,086
It's not our territory.

3
00:00:07,254 --> 00:00:09,021
They're not gonna do
a thing about it.

4
00:00:09,428 --> 00:00:11,824
Your tumor has shrunk by 80%.

5
00:00:11,992 --> 00:00:13,792
- What's this?
- I'm in recovery.

6
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:17,162
You know, pot is, like,
stepping stones.

7
00:00:17,330 --> 00:00:18,998
How do you want to proceed?

8
00:00:19,167 --> 00:00:20,566
Sell off what we have.

9
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:22,935
Then I guess I'm done.

10
00:00:23,104 --> 00:00:24,403
Nothing's really changed.

11
00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:26,872
We sell when we want, where we want.

12
00:00:27,041 --> 00:00:28,458
This is our city.

13
00:00:28,583 --> 00:00:30,133
We're gonna be kings.

14
00:01:02,922 --> 00:01:03,922
What's up?

15
00:01:35,842 --> 00:01:37,042
What you need?

16
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:43,710
Yo, you buyin', or are you
just stopping to envy?

17
00:01:47,998 --> 00:01:49,148
Punk bitches.

18
00:02:30,884 --> 00:02:34,233
<i>Please leave your message
for 505-1275223.</i>

19
00:02:37,037 --> 00:02:39,684
<i>Record your message after the tone.
To send a numeric page...</i>

20
00:02:39,809 --> 00:02:42,942
Bounce, little man.
Skinny, I'm up on 2nd and Hazeltine,

21
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:44,737
getting eyeballed hard.

22
00:02:44,862 --> 00:02:47,186
I got a bad feeling, man.
I need some backup.

23
00:02:47,311 --> 00:02:49,061
Get your ass up here now.

24
00:02:53,035 --> 00:02:56,255
- What's that thing in your ear?
- What did I say? Get out of here!

25
00:02:57,420 --> 00:02:59,370
What are you waiting for? Go!

26
00:03:45,205 --> 00:03:48,205
Synch: Tyno, Michvanilly

27
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:09,271
We've made such headway
with your treatments

28
00:04:09,396 --> 00:04:12,546
that now it's time we talked
about sealing the deal.

29
00:04:12,777 --> 00:04:13,827
Absolutely.

30
00:04:14,197 --> 00:04:15,378
As you know,

31
00:04:15,779 --> 00:04:18,737
my initial diagnosis was
that your cancer was inoperable.

32
00:04:20,753 --> 00:04:22,803
That may no longer be the case.

33
00:04:23,051 --> 00:04:27,051
We think now that a lobectomy
may be a viable option.

34
00:04:27,663 --> 00:04:29,513
Maybe a pretty good option.

35
00:04:30,016 --> 00:04:32,594
Dr. Bravenec is one of the few surgeons
in the country

36
00:04:32,719 --> 00:04:35,054
performing lobectomies
after full-dosage radiation.

37
00:04:35,618 --> 00:04:37,570
He's got a good track record.

38
00:04:37,957 --> 00:04:39,057
Pretty good.

39
00:04:40,464 --> 00:04:41,564
It sounds...

40
00:04:43,523 --> 00:04:44,573
aggressive.

41
00:04:45,384 --> 00:04:46,899
Yes. Very much so.

42
00:04:47,554 --> 00:04:50,140
Understand that if you
don't have this surgery,

43
00:04:50,265 --> 00:04:52,438
you're just waiting
for the cancer to spread.

44
00:04:53,118 --> 00:04:54,218
And it will.

45
00:04:55,715 --> 00:04:58,928
Now, through the treatment you've had
already, we've bought you some time...

46
00:04:59,053 --> 00:05:01,777
Maybe a lot, probably a little,

47
00:05:02,877 --> 00:05:04,127
but that's all.

48
00:05:04,981 --> 00:05:06,181
In my opinion,

49
00:05:06,753 --> 00:05:09,053
if you're willing to take some risk,

50
00:05:09,395 --> 00:05:11,457
then this offers the best chance.

51
00:05:18,104 --> 00:05:19,951
How much would it cost?

52
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:22,034
I'm not on your insurance.

53
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:24,936
I'd say between 170,000

54
00:05:25,349 --> 00:05:27,314
and 200,000, all in.

55
00:05:27,977 --> 00:05:31,298
For my part, I'd be willing
to write off what I can,

56
00:05:31,423 --> 00:05:33,546
but mine isn't even
the biggest expense.

57
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:39,846
This is obviously a big decision.

58
00:05:40,431 --> 00:05:44,031
And you folks are gonna
want to take some time to discuss it.

59
00:05:46,934 --> 00:05:47,893
I'll do it.

60
00:05:54,595 --> 00:05:58,290
Don't you think we should at least
talk this through first?

61
00:05:59,954 --> 00:06:02,153
I just think it's the way to go.

62
00:06:05,864 --> 00:06:07,813
I have to say I think

63
00:06:07,981 --> 00:06:09,581
it's the right choice.

64
00:06:11,227 --> 00:06:15,199
I recommend that we let the pneumonitis
heal for another couple of weeks,

65
00:06:15,688 --> 00:06:17,823
and then we'll have at it.

66
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:21,427
That's tricky.

67
00:06:24,402 --> 00:06:27,193
- When's the due date?
- It's the 21st.

68
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:29,494
So two weeks and change?

69
00:06:29,619 --> 00:06:31,755
I'll book the surgery
for four weeks from now.

70
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:34,974
That way, Walter can be on his feet
for the birth of your daughter.

71
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:37,893
But I wouldn't wait any longer.

72
00:06:59,062 --> 00:07:00,230
14 messag...

73
00:07:01,648 --> 00:07:02,450
God.

74
00:07:07,139 --> 00:07:08,040
It's me.

75
00:07:08,165 --> 00:07:11,215
<i>Where the hell were you?
I called, like, 20 times.</i>

76
00:07:11,783 --> 00:07:12,783
Working.

77
00:07:13,362 --> 00:07:14,412
What is it?

78
00:07:17,916 --> 00:07:19,066
Combo's dead.

79
00:07:20,085 --> 00:07:20,951
Shot.

80
00:07:23,269 --> 00:07:24,423
Which one is he?

81
00:07:25,610 --> 00:07:27,542
You did not just say that to me.

82
00:07:27,667 --> 00:07:29,895
- Jesse, listen...
- That figures.

83
00:07:42,650 --> 00:07:44,210
What's the word on the street?

84
00:07:45,127 --> 00:07:46,977
No one's dropping no names.

85
00:07:47,443 --> 00:07:50,449
Combo rang me before it went down.
Said dudes were mad-dogging him,

86
00:07:50,627 --> 00:07:53,927
trying to run him up off the corner.
That's all I know.

87
00:07:55,889 --> 00:07:59,139
Why'd we have to go pushing
into new turf, yo? I mean,

88
00:08:00,093 --> 00:08:01,493
what'd you expect?

89
00:08:03,211 --> 00:08:04,361
I don't know.

90
00:08:04,739 --> 00:08:05,989
You don't know?

91
00:08:07,531 --> 00:08:09,031
Is that all you got?

92
00:08:10,779 --> 00:08:12,879
I'll do right by Combo's people.

93
00:08:15,316 --> 00:08:17,990
Make sure you bust up
your cell and toss it.

94
00:08:18,541 --> 00:08:20,041
We'll figure it out.

95
00:08:22,332 --> 00:08:24,882
I appreciate what
you're saying and all,

96
00:08:25,095 --> 00:08:28,445
but with Combo gone
and Badger laying low out in Cali...

97
00:08:30,345 --> 00:08:31,891
I'm on probation, man.

98
00:08:32,401 --> 00:08:34,188
Fast track to Los Lunas.

99
00:08:36,772 --> 00:08:38,172
We're on the verge

100
00:08:38,949 --> 00:08:41,203
of making some serious coin.

101
00:08:43,317 --> 00:08:45,671
What, you're gonna jump ship now?

102
00:08:47,599 --> 00:08:51,477
This game we playing, we don't got
the street cred to survive it.

103
00:08:52,315 --> 00:08:55,953
Back when everyone thought you killed
Spooge, maybe we were doing okay,

104
00:08:56,078 --> 00:08:57,428
but that whole...

105
00:08:58,073 --> 00:09:00,355
thing to the head thing, the ATM?

106
00:09:01,182 --> 00:09:03,022
His junkie bitch copped to it.

107
00:09:03,837 --> 00:09:06,137
The whole town knows it wasn't you.

108
00:09:11,342 --> 00:09:12,592
Everyone knows?

109
00:09:14,801 --> 00:09:17,951
- Why didn't you say something?
- I don't know, man.

110
00:09:18,644 --> 00:09:20,475
'Cause we like you and all.

111
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:22,700
I'm telling you, just sit tight.

112
00:09:24,535 --> 00:09:25,685
We'll get by.

113
00:09:26,216 --> 00:09:27,416
We'll make it.

114
00:09:27,902 --> 00:09:29,052
Sorry, Jesse.

115
00:09:30,489 --> 00:09:31,404
I'm out.

116
00:09:41,474 --> 00:09:45,365
We have had a bit of a setback.

117
00:09:46,668 --> 00:09:50,135
Sorry, that's an accurate description.
What else do you want me to call it?

118
00:09:50,323 --> 00:09:53,442
- How about your fault? How about that?
- Don't lay that on me.

119
00:09:53,567 --> 00:09:56,673
- You are in charge of distribution.
- You said expand the territory.

120
00:09:56,798 --> 00:09:59,144
- That doesn't mean you become careless.
- Guys, guys!

121
00:09:59,312 --> 00:10:02,248
Who do I look like, Maury Povich?
I'm not your marriage counselor.

122
00:10:02,902 --> 00:10:05,050
Now, you're professionals.
Act like it.

123
00:10:05,523 --> 00:10:07,319
Now, setback. Go.

124
00:10:08,408 --> 00:10:10,795
One of our dealers was murdered.

125
00:10:12,713 --> 00:10:16,246
It was some kind of turf dispute,

126
00:10:17,089 --> 00:10:18,739
and apparently we lost.

127
00:10:19,585 --> 00:10:21,524
And then everyone quit on us.

128
00:10:21,649 --> 00:10:24,100
We have absolutely no distribution.

129
00:10:25,401 --> 00:10:28,006
Is there any way any of this
can be traced back to you?

130
00:10:28,131 --> 00:10:30,009
Now, the police, I'm talking about.

131
00:10:33,158 --> 00:10:34,780
There's your silver lighting.

132
00:10:35,158 --> 00:10:37,750
How about you?
How's the health situation?

133
00:10:39,558 --> 00:10:41,529
It's better.
Do you mind?

134
00:10:41,654 --> 00:10:42,549
Better?

135
00:10:48,472 --> 00:10:51,854
It's looking a little more positive.

136
00:10:52,754 --> 00:10:54,533
I may have more time than I thought.

137
00:10:54,887 --> 00:10:55,987
Outstanding.

138
00:10:56,922 --> 00:10:58,672
Now, as to your dead guy,

139
00:10:59,399 --> 00:11:00,899
occupational hazard.

140
00:11:01,170 --> 00:11:02,929
Drug dealer getting shot,

141
00:11:03,054 --> 00:11:06,904
I'm gonna go out on a limb here
and say it's been known to happen.

142
00:11:07,209 --> 00:11:10,082
Now, what about product on hand?
How's your inventory?

143
00:11:12,648 --> 00:11:14,486
38 and change.

144
00:11:14,856 --> 00:11:16,555
38 ounces? Grams?

145
00:11:17,009 --> 00:11:17,957
Pounds.

146
00:11:20,865 --> 00:11:23,429
You did say make hay
while the sun is shining.

147
00:11:24,042 --> 00:11:24,867
Guys!

148
00:11:26,075 --> 00:11:27,775
Why the long faces here?

149
00:11:28,087 --> 00:11:30,169
You're sitting on a gold mine.

150
00:11:30,451 --> 00:11:32,438
A gold mine we can't sell.

151
00:11:32,621 --> 00:11:34,906
We need a proper infrastructure.

152
00:11:35,368 --> 00:11:37,567
We need foot soldiers and dealers

153
00:11:37,692 --> 00:11:39,578
on a street level
that are rock solid.

154
00:11:39,946 --> 00:11:42,815
We need muscle,
and we need enforcers.

155
00:11:43,274 --> 00:11:44,984
Payback.
That's what we need.

156
00:11:50,326 --> 00:11:51,129
God.

157
00:11:53,436 --> 00:11:56,336
I mean, this entire process
has just been so...

158
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:03,869
It's always been one step forward
and two steps back.

159
00:12:04,685 --> 00:12:06,085
We need your help.

160
00:12:08,207 --> 00:12:10,987
Let's start with some
tough love, all right?

161
00:12:11,112 --> 00:12:12,922
Ready for this?
Here goes.

162
00:12:13,047 --> 00:12:15,481
You two suck at peddling meth.

163
00:12:15,649 --> 00:12:16,561
Period.

164
00:12:17,173 --> 00:12:19,803
So give up on trying
to do it all yourselves.

165
00:12:19,928 --> 00:12:22,178
Hell, I'm amazed you got this far.

166
00:12:22,585 --> 00:12:26,585
Look, we are not going to deal with
another high-level distributor.

167
00:12:27,116 --> 00:12:29,378
No, thank you.
We have been down that road.

168
00:12:29,503 --> 00:12:32,070
What?
Some tattooed speed-freak?

169
00:12:32,914 --> 00:12:35,659
What you two need is
an honest-to-God businessman.

170
00:12:35,784 --> 00:12:37,628
Somebody who treats your product

171
00:12:37,753 --> 00:12:40,839
like the simple
high-margin commodity that it is.

172
00:12:41,513 --> 00:12:44,731
Somebody who ships out of town,
deals only in bulk.

173
00:12:45,108 --> 00:12:49,099
Someone who's been doing this
for 20 years and never been caught.

174
00:12:51,528 --> 00:12:53,232
You know someone like that?

175
00:12:53,357 --> 00:12:55,480
Let's just say I know a guy

176
00:12:55,605 --> 00:12:56,905
who knows a guy.

177
00:12:57,665 --> 00:12:59,265
Who knows another guy.

178
00:12:59,771 --> 00:13:03,071
Let me make some calls,
see if I can get you a meeting.

179
00:13:05,470 --> 00:13:07,070
Well, what's his name?

180
00:13:08,777 --> 00:13:10,027
I have no idea.

181
00:13:11,267 --> 00:13:12,867
He's very low profile.

182
00:13:12,992 --> 00:13:14,642
He's careful like that.

183
00:13:16,143 --> 00:13:18,143
From what I do hear about him,

184
00:13:18,378 --> 00:13:20,278
he sounds a little like you.

185
00:13:38,447 --> 00:13:39,947
I need you to leave.

186
00:13:49,256 --> 00:13:50,556
Look, there's...

187
00:13:52,379 --> 00:13:55,029
some stuff about me
you don't know, and...

188
00:13:59,391 --> 00:14:00,886
Like you're a drug dealer?

189
00:14:02,751 --> 00:14:04,201
I kind of got that.

190
00:14:05,776 --> 00:14:08,526
You pay in cash,
and you use an alias, so...

191
00:14:16,118 --> 00:14:17,418
One of my guys,

192
00:14:19,311 --> 00:14:21,261
a friend who worked for me...

193
00:14:23,111 --> 00:14:24,276
got murdered.

194
00:14:26,155 --> 00:14:28,447
It was my fault.
I put him on that corner.

195
00:14:30,486 --> 00:14:32,436
I'm gonna smoke some crystal,

196
00:14:33,113 --> 00:14:36,263
and I just think you should go,
being that you're

197
00:14:36,583 --> 00:14:38,457
in a program and all and...

198
00:14:41,710 --> 00:14:43,629
You could come with me to a meeting.

199
00:14:48,557 --> 00:14:49,657
No meetings.

200
00:14:50,821 --> 00:14:53,768
We could just get out of here.

201
00:14:57,177 --> 00:15:00,276
- It won't help.
- Yeah, it will.

202
00:15:00,401 --> 00:15:03,782
And I don't need you
telling me that it won't.

203
00:15:04,076 --> 00:15:05,076
I just...

204
00:15:05,950 --> 00:15:09,522
All right, I really
just need you to go.

205
00:16:15,172 --> 00:16:15,973
Sir?

206
00:16:16,228 --> 00:16:17,528
Enjoy your meal.

207
00:16:50,173 --> 00:16:51,273
You're late.

208
00:16:54,984 --> 00:16:57,329
We're in the big time now.

209
00:16:58,364 --> 00:17:00,017
So where's the kingpin?

210
00:17:01,186 --> 00:17:03,186
Your guess is as good as mine.

211
00:17:07,629 --> 00:17:09,479
So you get the dude's name?

212
00:17:12,255 --> 00:17:15,595
So let me get this straight.
He's allowed to know all our names,

213
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:18,050
what we look like,
but not the other way around?

214
00:17:22,056 --> 00:17:24,256
Why don't you
get yourself some food?

215
00:17:24,819 --> 00:17:28,803
So we won't both sit here with our Happy
Meals, looking like a couple chumps?

216
00:17:28,928 --> 00:17:31,597
Gentlemen,
is everything to your satisfaction?

217
00:17:32,128 --> 00:17:33,278
Fine, thanks.

218
00:17:35,716 --> 00:17:37,916
This is nothing but an ankle-grab.

219
00:17:39,284 --> 00:17:40,834
I don't get you, man.

220
00:17:41,141 --> 00:17:44,691
A week ago you talked
like you were all ready to hang it up.

221
00:17:46,198 --> 00:17:49,381
We've nearly got 40 pounds
we still need to sell.

222
00:17:49,874 --> 00:17:51,405
What about after?

223
00:17:51,661 --> 00:17:54,795
After, you gonna make up
some new magic number?

224
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:57,833
Like, "I got bills. I got bills.
I gotta make more."

225
00:17:57,958 --> 00:18:00,158
What do you want me to say, Jesse?

226
00:18:00,566 --> 00:18:02,862
- Things have changed.
- Oh, I know.

227
00:18:04,709 --> 00:18:06,209
We got a guy killed.

228
00:18:10,067 --> 00:18:11,267
You know what?

229
00:18:13,182 --> 00:18:14,406
This is bullshit.

230
00:18:15,412 --> 00:18:16,712
I'm out of here.

231
00:18:27,401 --> 00:18:29,651
I think she's waking up from a nap.

232
00:18:30,657 --> 00:18:34,093
She is certainly going to want
to get out and stretch those legs soon.

233
00:18:38,759 --> 00:18:42,426
We'll keep an eye on your fluids.
You're on the low side of normal.

234
00:18:42,551 --> 00:18:44,405
What? How low?

235
00:18:45,172 --> 00:18:48,571
It's not a problem unless we see
a growth drop-off, so we're good.

236
00:18:48,696 --> 00:18:52,674
We'll just have you in for an ultrasound
next week and keep an eye on things.

237
00:18:55,182 --> 00:18:57,477
Oh, man, you would
not believe the traffic.

238
00:18:57,602 --> 00:18:59,795
That's why I left 40 minutes early.

239
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:00,725
Sorry.

240
00:19:01,910 --> 00:19:04,356
- What did I miss?
- For your refrigerator.

241
00:19:05,426 --> 00:19:06,476
Oh, my God.

242
00:19:06,942 --> 00:19:08,042
Look at her.

243
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:09,165
Look.

244
00:19:10,018 --> 00:19:12,621
God. It's like she's here already.

245
00:19:12,877 --> 00:19:15,877
I was just telling Skyler
everything looks great.

246
00:19:16,549 --> 00:19:18,855
Okay, we've been talking
about it for months now.

247
00:19:18,980 --> 00:19:20,839
It's time to make a decision.

248
00:19:21,007 --> 00:19:24,057
- You know what I'm going to say?
- The C-section?

249
00:19:24,573 --> 00:19:26,855
And if it's a yes,
we need to schedule it.

250
00:19:28,494 --> 00:19:31,807
My last labor was
pretty tough, so...

251
00:19:33,408 --> 00:19:36,055
For the baby, I say yes.

252
00:19:36,357 --> 00:19:38,841
I agree, considering that your fluids
are on the low side.

253
00:19:38,966 --> 00:19:40,798
It's best
we take her a little early.

254
00:19:40,923 --> 00:19:43,123
So why don't we schedule it for...

255
00:19:43,649 --> 00:19:45,030
a week from Friday?

256
00:19:47,901 --> 00:19:49,735
Isn't that a Friday the 13th?

257
00:19:54,393 --> 00:19:55,843
We have a birthday.

258
00:19:56,842 --> 00:19:57,842
The 16th.

259
00:19:58,643 --> 00:19:59,643
I like it.

260
00:20:02,092 --> 00:20:04,033
You know, speaking of birthdays,

261
00:20:04,158 --> 00:20:07,663
I've got to run back to the office,
so I will see you later?

262
00:20:07,788 --> 00:20:10,153
It's an hour before closing.

263
00:20:11,236 --> 00:20:13,154
You're supposed
to be taking it easy.

264
00:20:13,279 --> 00:20:15,667
We're having a little get-together
for Ted's birthday

265
00:20:15,792 --> 00:20:17,912
and I've got to pick up the cake.

266
00:20:18,037 --> 00:20:18,956
Why you?

267
00:20:20,293 --> 00:20:23,084
Because I said I would.

268
00:20:24,470 --> 00:20:26,170
It's the least I can do.

269
00:21:20,232 --> 00:21:21,832
Let's get out of here.

270
00:21:22,255 --> 00:21:24,055
You know, go do something.

271
00:21:26,004 --> 00:21:27,004
Seriously.

272
00:21:28,155 --> 00:21:31,205
You know that museum
in Santa Fe you talked about?

273
00:21:32,016 --> 00:21:33,466
Let's take a drive.

274
00:21:38,033 --> 00:21:38,833
Sure.

275
00:21:58,214 --> 00:22:01,127
No, I cannot return that stock.
It's already been drilled and cut,

276
00:22:01,252 --> 00:22:03,252
We're halfway through the job.

277
00:22:03,754 --> 00:22:05,850
<i>Mr. Beneke to the shop, please.</i>

278
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:12,169
All right.
Just let me think about it, okay?

279
00:22:12,294 --> 00:22:13,344
I gotta go.

280
00:22:13,753 --> 00:22:15,685
Dean, I gotta go.

281
00:22:21,420 --> 00:22:22,837
Happy Birthday!

282
00:22:26,489 --> 00:22:29,461
My God. This is beautiful, guys.
Thank you very much.

283
00:22:29,809 --> 00:22:32,398
Hurry. These candles aren't gonna
hold out much longer.

284
00:22:33,402 --> 00:22:34,520
Wait a minute.

285
00:22:34,645 --> 00:22:37,445
Are you making a wish?
You gotta make a wish.

286
00:22:37,767 --> 00:22:40,478
Well, let's see.
The economy's in the toilet.

287
00:22:40,603 --> 00:22:43,709
China's undercutting us at every turn...
I'm at a loss.

288
00:22:46,170 --> 00:22:46,970
Wait.

289
00:22:48,939 --> 00:22:50,349
I want to hear it first.

290
00:22:51,377 --> 00:22:52,950
Absolutely not.
No way.

291
00:22:53,075 --> 00:22:55,556
You cannot deny
your employer his birthday wish.

292
00:22:55,681 --> 00:22:58,224
- Yes, I can. Watch me.
- Please!

293
00:22:58,695 --> 00:23:02,498
If this is your birthday wish,
I feel very, very sorry for you.

294
00:23:02,623 --> 00:23:05,898
- Come on. It was so good last time.
- It was ages ago.

295
00:23:06,929 --> 00:23:09,012
And I'm enormous now.

296
00:23:09,137 --> 00:23:11,389
And I don't look anything
like her anymore.

297
00:23:11,514 --> 00:23:13,906
Not that I ever did.
I mean, come on.

298
00:23:14,075 --> 00:23:16,542
You guys, these candles
are getting wax all over the place.

299
00:23:16,710 --> 00:23:19,060
- Seriously.
- Yes, come on, Skyler.

300
00:23:21,146 --> 00:23:22,296
It's obscene.

301
00:23:37,012 --> 00:23:39,385
<i>Happy Birthday</i>

302
00:23:40,592 --> 00:23:42,268
<i>To you</i>

303
00:23:43,644 --> 00:23:46,352
<i>Happy Birthday</i>

304
00:23:47,310 --> 00:23:48,740
<i>To you</i>

305
00:23:50,618 --> 00:23:53,403
<i>Happy Birthday</i>

306
00:23:54,164 --> 00:23:56,739
<i>Mr. President</i>

307
00:23:57,343 --> 00:24:00,917
<i>Of Beneke Fabricators Incorporated</i>

308
00:24:03,118 --> 00:24:06,009
<i>Happy Birthday</i>

309
00:24:07,602 --> 00:24:09,295
<i>To you</i>

310
00:24:14,775 --> 00:24:16,225
That was fantastic.

311
00:24:16,668 --> 00:24:18,218
Isn't she great, huh?

312
00:24:19,162 --> 00:24:20,512
Okay, here we go.

313
00:24:30,683 --> 00:24:33,252
<i>- He wasn't there.
- He was there all right.</i>

314
00:24:33,625 --> 00:24:37,525
What are you talking about?
I sat there for two hours. Nobody came.

315
00:24:37,650 --> 00:24:40,192
<i>All I know is my contact
says he was there.</i>

316
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:42,777
Are you sure you were
at the right restaurant?

317
00:24:42,902 --> 00:24:44,630
Yes, I'm positive.

318
00:24:44,798 --> 00:24:46,332
<i>- Where was he?
- Who knows?</i>

319
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:48,267
Maybe he stayed out
in the parking lot,

320
00:24:48,392 --> 00:24:51,411
checked you out with a telephoto lens.
Didn't like the cut of your jib.

321
00:24:51,536 --> 00:24:52,398
Anyway,

322
00:24:52,523 --> 00:24:55,741
it doesn't matter now
because my contact says it's a no go.

323
00:24:56,774 --> 00:24:58,410
What?
What do you mean?

324
00:24:58,820 --> 00:25:00,178
No deal. No dice.

325
00:25:00,303 --> 00:25:02,114
Shot at and missed, shit on and hit.

326
00:25:02,757 --> 00:25:06,486
Wait a minute. How can he make
that decision without even meeting me?

327
00:25:06,611 --> 00:25:09,588
<i>I told you he's very cautious
who he does business with.</i>

328
00:25:09,756 --> 00:25:13,388
All right?
He's skittish, like a deer.

329
00:25:16,202 --> 00:25:17,402
Call him back.

330
00:25:17,803 --> 00:25:19,703
<i>I'm sorry.
I can't do that.</i>

331
00:25:20,063 --> 00:25:22,404
Yes, you can.
Call him, Saul.

332
00:25:22,976 --> 00:25:25,216
First of all,
I never called him, all right?

333
00:25:25,341 --> 00:25:27,665
I called a guy who called
a guy who called a guy.

334
00:25:27,790 --> 00:25:29,275
Second of all, it's over.

335
00:25:29,443 --> 00:25:32,186
<i>Understand?
With this particular individual,</i>

336
00:25:32,311 --> 00:25:34,487
<i>all you get is the one shot.</i>

337
00:25:35,801 --> 00:25:36,601
Look,

338
00:25:37,187 --> 00:25:40,030
I'll see if I can scrape
something else together,

339
00:25:40,155 --> 00:25:41,720
but don't get your hopes up.

340
00:25:41,888 --> 00:25:44,338
<i>No one else handles
that kind of bulk.</i>

341
00:25:44,858 --> 00:25:45,758
Damn it.

342
00:27:26,483 --> 00:27:29,361
Lucy, you must remember to have
the salt and pepper shakers wiped.

343
00:27:36,693 --> 00:27:38,193
Can I help you, sir?

344
00:27:40,192 --> 00:27:41,592
Diet Coke, please.

345
00:27:44,588 --> 00:27:46,588
And five minutes of your time.

346
00:27:57,991 --> 00:27:59,507
What can I do for you?

347
00:27:59,632 --> 00:28:00,626
Have a seat.

348
00:28:02,484 --> 00:28:03,334
Please.

349
00:28:15,387 --> 00:28:18,987
I would like to know
why you wouldn't meet with me yesterday.

350
00:28:20,962 --> 00:28:23,403
I'm sorry.
I'm not following.

351
00:28:24,630 --> 00:28:27,730
I sat here yesterday,
waiting to meet with someone.

352
00:28:29,054 --> 00:28:31,054
I believe that person was you.

353
00:28:32,047 --> 00:28:35,097
I think that you're confusing me
for someone else.

354
00:28:36,466 --> 00:28:37,897
I don't think I am.

355
00:28:42,053 --> 00:28:44,003
Sir, if you have a complaint,

356
00:28:44,128 --> 00:28:46,340
I suggest you submit it through
our e-mail system.

357
00:28:46,465 --> 00:28:48,974
I would be happy to refer you
to our website.

358
00:28:50,571 --> 00:28:53,574
I was told that the man
I would be meeting with

359
00:28:53,699 --> 00:28:54,999
is very careful.

360
00:28:56,104 --> 00:28:57,354
A cautious man.

361
00:28:59,241 --> 00:29:01,441
I believe we're alike in that way.

362
00:29:03,883 --> 00:29:04,757
If you are

363
00:29:05,484 --> 00:29:06,984
who I think you are,

364
00:29:08,029 --> 00:29:10,029
you should give me another chance.

365
00:29:15,228 --> 00:29:17,970
I don't think we're alike
at all, Mr. White.

366
00:29:19,776 --> 00:29:22,152
You are not a cautious man at all.

367
00:29:22,829 --> 00:29:25,744
Your partner was late,
and he was high.

368
00:29:28,766 --> 00:29:30,018
Yes, he was.

369
00:29:30,481 --> 00:29:33,177
He's high often, isn't he?

370
00:29:37,171 --> 00:29:38,821
You have poor judgment.

371
00:29:40,453 --> 00:29:42,445
I can't work with someone
with poor judgment.

372
00:29:42,570 --> 00:29:45,664
Are you familiar with my product?

373
00:29:46,306 --> 00:29:48,688
I've been told it's excellent.

374
00:29:48,911 --> 00:29:50,306
It is impeccable.

375
00:29:51,176 --> 00:29:52,526
It is the purest,

376
00:29:52,872 --> 00:29:56,141
most chemically-sound product
on the market anywhere.

377
00:29:56,471 --> 00:29:58,625
That is not the only factor.

378
00:29:58,967 --> 00:30:01,041
You could charge twice

379
00:30:01,166 --> 00:30:05,166
the current rate for what I provide,
and your customers would pay it.

380
00:30:06,044 --> 00:30:07,094
Hands down.

381
00:30:08,674 --> 00:30:12,282
Now, who I choose to do business
with on my end

382
00:30:12,708 --> 00:30:14,208
is not your problem.

383
00:30:15,829 --> 00:30:17,272
You won't see him.

384
00:30:17,397 --> 00:30:19,357
You won't interact with him.

385
00:30:20,661 --> 00:30:22,201
Forget he exists.

386
00:30:23,831 --> 00:30:25,247
I have to ask.

387
00:30:27,829 --> 00:30:28,629
Why?

388
00:30:29,228 --> 00:30:30,128
Why him?

389
00:30:33,291 --> 00:30:35,259
Because he does what I say.

390
00:30:37,558 --> 00:30:39,643
Because I can trust him.

391
00:30:41,494 --> 00:30:43,622
How much product
do you have on hand?

392
00:30:44,388 --> 00:30:45,690
38 pounds.

393
00:30:46,577 --> 00:30:48,727
Ready to go at a moment's notice.

394
00:30:55,343 --> 00:30:56,893
Will I hear from you?

395
00:30:59,828 --> 00:31:01,106
I have your numbers.

396
00:31:05,376 --> 00:31:08,125
You can never trust a drug addict.

397
00:31:24,206 --> 00:31:27,184
Look, I mean, it's all kind
of little dribs and drabs,

398
00:31:27,309 --> 00:31:30,420
but right here,
take Keller, for instance.

399
00:31:30,545 --> 00:31:33,695
A couple hundred dollars here,
a few thousand there.

400
00:31:34,239 --> 00:31:35,539
Dribs and drabs.

401
00:31:36,276 --> 00:31:38,445
Once you add it all up, though,
and with Keller,

402
00:31:38,570 --> 00:31:41,686
the revenues are almost 10% less
than was actually received.

403
00:31:42,013 --> 00:31:45,996
And this is every quarter,
for the last two years.

404
00:31:50,008 --> 00:31:52,725
When I saw that, I got worried,
so I checked Accounts Receivable

405
00:31:52,893 --> 00:31:56,038
on other customers.
I found six other instances

406
00:31:58,058 --> 00:32:00,208
of revenues being under-reported.

407
00:32:01,565 --> 00:32:04,265
And I've only just started
to look into it.

408
00:32:04,478 --> 00:32:07,833
We have requirement contracts
with a lot of these companies.

409
00:32:07,958 --> 00:32:10,283
They anticipate their needs
for the next quarter.

410
00:32:10,408 --> 00:32:12,446
Most of the time, they overestimate.

411
00:32:12,571 --> 00:32:15,095
So I just let them roll their overages
into the next order

412
00:32:15,220 --> 00:32:17,383
and if I don't,
they'll go elsewhere.

413
00:32:17,508 --> 00:32:19,059
Obviously, we forgot

414
00:32:19,333 --> 00:32:22,748
or didn't go back
and adjust the revenue entries.

415
00:32:23,599 --> 00:32:27,359
I know it's wrong from an accounting
standpoint, but as you can see,

416
00:32:27,527 --> 00:32:30,527
the money's coming in.
Ventually, as you can see.

417
00:32:31,596 --> 00:32:32,396
Right.

418
00:32:33,415 --> 00:32:34,565
Right, but...

419
00:32:34,770 --> 00:32:38,688
I got the old bills of sale
and order forms out of storage,

420
00:32:39,973 --> 00:32:42,110
to try and sort this out.

421
00:32:43,433 --> 00:32:47,379
And most of the time, there's no backup
for the reported revenues at all.

422
00:32:48,790 --> 00:32:50,040
In a few cases,

423
00:32:52,357 --> 00:32:55,286
I found Xeroxed copies
with the dates changed.

424
00:33:10,384 --> 00:33:11,384
All right.

425
00:33:13,834 --> 00:33:14,884
You got me.

426
00:33:15,902 --> 00:33:19,870
We're talking nearly a million
dollars of undocumented revenue.

427
00:33:21,213 --> 00:33:23,713
- What are you thinking?
- I'm thinking

428
00:33:24,563 --> 00:33:26,213
about saving a company.

429
00:33:26,820 --> 00:33:28,789
I'm thinking about people's jobs,

430
00:33:28,914 --> 00:33:31,907
about their mortgages and pensions

431
00:33:32,032 --> 00:33:34,159
and their college
funds for their kids.

432
00:33:34,936 --> 00:33:36,410
Not to mention my own.

433
00:33:36,535 --> 00:33:38,964
It doesn't mean that you
have to break the law.

434
00:33:39,132 --> 00:33:40,282
Yes, it does.

435
00:33:40,695 --> 00:33:43,023
It's right there in the books.
Business is terrible.

436
00:33:43,148 --> 00:33:46,629
The bank is on my back,
the IRS is grinding me down to a nub.

437
00:33:46,754 --> 00:33:48,140
If I don't keep up...

438
00:33:48,527 --> 00:33:50,747
People go to prison for this.

439
00:33:57,262 --> 00:34:00,286
My dad built this
company from nothing.

440
00:34:02,130 --> 00:34:03,630
We make things here.

441
00:34:03,967 --> 00:34:06,567
The people who work
here are like family.

442
00:34:07,503 --> 00:34:11,303
I can't let that all fall apart
because of a couple of bad years.

443
00:34:19,749 --> 00:34:21,149
Don't report this.

444
00:34:22,695 --> 00:34:23,545
Please.

445
00:34:26,589 --> 00:34:28,389
I'm not gonna turn you in.

446
00:34:34,050 --> 00:34:35,950
But I can't be a part of it.

447
00:34:39,571 --> 00:34:40,421
I know.

448
00:34:41,573 --> 00:34:43,173
I know. I just wish...

449
00:34:45,079 --> 00:34:46,079
I'm sorry.

450
00:34:48,726 --> 00:34:50,376
I don't want you to go.

451
00:35:08,422 --> 00:35:10,906
<i>Yo, if I know you, leave a message.</i>

452
00:35:11,653 --> 00:35:14,428
<i>Yo, it's Skinny Pete.
Just checking in with you, man.</i>

453
00:35:14,553 --> 00:35:16,428
<i>We missed you at the funeral today.</i>

454
00:35:16,596 --> 00:35:20,460
<i>The whole crew was representing. Even
Badger came all the way from Fresno.</i>

455
00:35:20,585 --> 00:35:22,819
<i>Combo's people, his ma,
grandma, cousins,</i>

456
00:35:22,944 --> 00:35:24,897
<i>everyone was all choked up and shit.</i>

457
00:35:25,022 --> 00:35:27,366
<i>Man, it was, like, emotional.</i>

458
00:35:27,833 --> 00:35:29,832
<i>And you should have seen the coffin.</i>

459
00:35:29,957 --> 00:35:31,877
<i>It was like this shiny,
white pearlescent.</i>

460
00:35:32,045 --> 00:35:35,326
<i>Like, I'm pretty sure I've seen
the exact same paint job on a Lexus.</i>

461
00:35:35,451 --> 00:35:37,851
<i>So we're definitely
talking high-end.</i>

462
00:35:38,622 --> 00:35:41,672
<i>Anyway, guess you had something
bigger going down.</i>

463
00:35:42,055 --> 00:35:44,505
<i>Watch your back out there, bro.
Peace.</i>

464
00:36:27,632 --> 00:36:29,568
I like to mix some ice with it.

465
00:37:18,018 --> 00:37:18,984
Hold that.

466
00:37:22,124 --> 00:37:23,556
What's it feel like?

467
00:37:27,275 --> 00:37:28,575
There's a chill.

468
00:37:30,246 --> 00:37:32,146
Don't freak out.
It passes.

469
00:37:33,083 --> 00:37:34,133
And then...

470
00:37:34,496 --> 00:37:35,568
you'll see.

471
00:37:40,337 --> 00:37:41,837
I'll meet you there.

472
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:54,753
Take that off.

473
00:40:21,613 --> 00:40:23,702
Phones off, please.

474
00:40:42,258 --> 00:40:43,592
Pipes, I guess.

475
00:40:44,496 --> 00:40:47,159
All right, everyone.
Eyes on your paper.

476
00:40:47,788 --> 00:40:49,238
Eyes on your paper.

477
00:41:20,519 --> 00:41:22,435
Excuse me, where's the manager?

478
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:24,710
I'm the manager.
Can I help you?

479
00:41:27,582 --> 00:41:31,370
I met a man here last week.
A black gentleman. He's thin. Glasses.

480
00:41:31,539 --> 00:41:33,138
Yes, sir.
That's the owner.

481
00:41:34,634 --> 00:41:35,434
Owner.

482
00:41:35,608 --> 00:41:38,369
He owns 14 Los Pollos restaurants
in between here and Nevada.

483
00:41:38,494 --> 00:41:40,544
He could be at any one of them.

484
00:41:42,050 --> 00:41:45,384
Is there a phone number
that I can get to...

485
00:41:45,816 --> 00:41:48,320
I'm sorry, sir.
I can't give that out.

486
00:41:49,004 --> 00:41:52,954
Is this about a complaint? I'd be
happy to refer you to our website.

487
00:41:53,944 --> 00:41:55,828
- What's his name?
- Gustavo.

488
00:41:56,092 --> 00:41:56,892
Gus.

489
00:42:03,215 --> 00:42:05,495
38 pounds, $1.2 million.

490
00:42:05,620 --> 00:42:09,206
Truck stop,
2 miles south of exit 13 on the 25.

491
00:42:09,331 --> 00:42:10,281
One hour.

492
00:42:10,406 --> 00:42:12,244
- What?
- One hour. You in or out?

493
00:42:13,067 --> 00:42:16,482
In. In. Absolutely.
But I just need a little more time.

494
00:42:16,650 --> 00:42:18,494
One hour.
If you miss it,

495
00:42:18,619 --> 00:42:21,169
don't ever show your face
in here again.

496
00:42:27,183 --> 00:42:30,328
Exit 13 off the 25 South,
to a truck...

497
00:42:30,453 --> 00:42:33,853
<i>- Come on! Come on!
- Yo, if I know you, leave a message.</i>

498
00:42:34,849 --> 00:42:36,086
Pick up the phone.

499
00:42:36,663 --> 00:42:38,063
Pick up the phone!

500
00:42:39,171 --> 00:42:41,748
I'm coming by.
I need the product.

501
00:42:42,272 --> 00:42:43,943
I need the product now!

502
00:44:47,301 --> 00:44:48,201
Wake up!

503
00:44:52,357 --> 00:44:53,250
Wake up.

504
00:44:59,032 --> 00:45:00,212
Where'd you put it?

505
00:45:00,381 --> 00:45:02,815
- Where is it? Where's the product?
- Get off of me.

506
00:45:03,297 --> 00:45:05,489
Where is it?
Where'd you hide the meth?

507
00:45:05,614 --> 00:45:07,219
- In the kitchen.
- Where?

508
00:45:08,092 --> 00:45:09,221
Under the sink.

509
00:46:14,954 --> 00:46:16,342
Not now!
