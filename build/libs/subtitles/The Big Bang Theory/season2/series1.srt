1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:02,469
So you see, what you're eating
is not technically yogurt,

2
00:00:02,589 --> 00:00:05,024
because it doesn't have
enough live acidophilus cultures.

3
00:00:05,144 --> 00:00:08,235
It's really just ice milk
with carrageenan added for thickness.

4
00:00:08,495 --> 00:00:09,888
That's very interesting.

5
00:00:10,682 --> 00:00:12,937
It's also not pink
and has no berries.

6
00:00:14,699 --> 00:00:16,937
Yeah, but it doesn't
really answer my question.

7
00:00:17,193 --> 00:00:20,000
- What was your question again?
- Do you want some?

8
00:00:21,847 --> 00:00:24,193
- Right. No. I'm lactose intolerant.
- Right.

9
00:00:24,313 --> 00:00:26,321
- So, gas.
- Yeah, got it.

10
00:00:27,229 --> 00:00:29,158
Well... good night.

11
00:00:44,290 --> 00:00:45,525
What are you doing?

12
00:00:45,645 --> 00:00:46,949
There's a draft.

13
00:00:48,220 --> 00:00:49,593
I didn't feel a draft.

14
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:53,341
Why don't we just go into, your...

15
00:00:54,050 --> 00:00:56,768
Yeah, you know what, maybe
we should slow things down a little.

16
00:00:56,929 --> 00:00:58,917
I didn't mean
to go into your apartment to...

17
00:00:59,037 --> 00:01:00,671
- go fast.
- No, I know.

18
00:01:01,705 --> 00:01:04,608
I know what you meant, it's just...
this is only our first date.

19
00:01:04,776 --> 00:01:06,056
Okay, sure, no problem.

20
00:01:06,176 --> 00:01:08,613
Why don't we just figure out
where we're going

21
00:01:08,733 --> 00:01:10,757
and when we want to get there,

22
00:01:10,877 --> 00:01:13,798
and then rate of speed
equals distance over time.

23
00:01:16,779 --> 00:01:17,830
Solve for R.

24
00:01:19,623 --> 00:01:21,126
Or we could just wing it.

25
00:01:22,265 --> 00:01:23,735
That might work, too.

26
00:01:24,910 --> 00:01:27,160
- Good night, Leonard.
- Good night.

27
00:01:31,921 --> 00:01:33,502
He's coming. Screensaver!

28
00:01:39,103 --> 00:01:41,666
Hey, Leonard.
How was your date?

29
00:01:42,448 --> 00:01:43,530
Bite me.

30
00:01:45,507 --> 00:01:48,903
Sheldon, how could you just sit there
and let them spy on me?

31
00:01:49,063 --> 00:01:50,249
They were clever.

32
00:01:50,369 --> 00:01:53,616
They exploited my complete lack
of interest in what you were doing.

33
00:01:54,944 --> 00:01:58,145
You should thank us.
When future generations try to determine

34
00:01:58,265 --> 00:02:01,003
why your relationship
with Penny crashed and burned,

35
00:02:01,123 --> 00:02:03,179
this right here is the black box.

36
00:02:04,313 --> 00:02:06,795
What are you talking about?
The date went fine.

37
00:02:06,957 --> 00:02:08,797
She said she wants
to slow things down.

38
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:11,889
Okay, so she said
she wants to slow things down.

39
00:02:12,009 --> 00:02:15,816
It's like saying,
"I'm really enjoying this meal.

40
00:02:15,936 --> 00:02:18,079
"I'm going to slow down
and savor it."

41
00:02:18,885 --> 00:02:21,473
No, it's like,
"This fish tastes bad,

42
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,508
"so I'm gonna slow down
and spit it out."

43
00:02:27,769 --> 00:02:30,111
- You being the fish.
- I'm not the fish.

44
00:02:30,271 --> 00:02:32,249
Really?
Did you make a second date?

45
00:02:32,451 --> 00:02:34,490
No, we sort of decided to wing it.

46
00:02:34,651 --> 00:02:36,352
Even I know that's lame.

47
00:02:37,932 --> 00:02:40,563
Okay, all right,
let's assume your hypothesis.

48
00:02:40,683 --> 00:02:44,041
We went to dinner, we talked,
we laughed, we kissed.

49
00:02:44,202 --> 00:02:46,211
Where could I have possibly gone wrong?

50
00:02:46,371 --> 00:02:49,162
Think back, Leonard.
The littlest things can set women off.

51
00:02:49,282 --> 00:02:51,172
Like, "Hey, the waitress is hot,

52
00:02:51,292 --> 00:02:53,863
"I bet we could get her
to come home with us."

53
00:02:54,141 --> 00:02:56,018
Or, "How much
does your mom weigh?

54
00:02:56,138 --> 00:02:58,098
"I want to know what I'm getting into."

55
00:02:58,258 --> 00:03:01,684
- I didn't say anything like that.
- Good, 'cause they don't work.

56
00:03:02,526 --> 00:03:05,375
They also don't care for it
if you stare at them and hyperventilate.

57
00:03:05,495 --> 00:03:07,454
Sadly, that's my home run swing.

58
00:03:08,425 --> 00:03:10,323
Look, everything went fine.

59
00:03:10,808 --> 00:03:14,290
I didn't even have to refer
to my impromptu conversation starters.

60
00:03:14,958 --> 00:03:17,242
That woman across the hall is into me.

61
00:03:18,023 --> 00:03:19,452
Let's go to the tape.

62
00:03:21,548 --> 00:03:23,878
Look at her reaction
to the good night kiss.

63
00:03:23,998 --> 00:03:26,918
No change in respiration,
pupils un-dilated,

64
00:03:27,078 --> 00:03:30,109
- no flushing of the chest.
- Nice close-up, by the way.

65
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:33,720
Interesting. Her jaws are clenched:
no tongue access.

66
00:03:34,003 --> 00:03:36,397
Clearly a bad sign
amongst mating humans.

67
00:03:37,765 --> 00:03:39,472
That's not a bad sign.

68
00:03:39,632 --> 00:03:43,226
Please, you might as well have been
two iguana with no dewlap enlargement.

69
00:03:44,137 --> 00:03:46,818
And the worst sign of all
is you're here and not there.

70
00:03:46,938 --> 00:03:49,907
I'm not there
because I'm taking things slow,

71
00:03:50,597 --> 00:03:53,945
which, by the way, compared to you guys,
approaches warp speed.

72
00:03:55,732 --> 00:03:57,624
And take down that camera.

73
00:03:59,809 --> 00:04:02,227
He was a lot more fun
when he had no hope.

74
00:04:05,477 --> 00:04:06,650
Give him time.

75
00:04:08,783 --> 00:04:11,131
Episode 201: The Bad Fish Paradigm

76
00:04:11,866 --> 00:04:13,769
Synch: Sixe, Jesslataree

00:04:25,511 --> 00:04:27,228
seriessub.com / sub-way.fr / forom.com

78
00:04:39,141 --> 00:04:40,125
Hi.

79
00:04:40,245 --> 00:04:41,378
Oh, hi, Penny.

80
00:04:41,498 --> 00:04:45,480
FYI, the hot water is inadequate
on machine two, so colors only,

81
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,457
and four is still releasing the fabric
softener too early in the cycle,

82
00:04:48,619 --> 00:04:51,346
- so avoid using it for your delicates.
- Thanks.

83
00:04:54,859 --> 00:04:57,048
Good Lord...
why don't you just take your clothes

84
00:04:57,168 --> 00:04:59,702
down to the river
and beat them with a rock?

85
00:05:06,234 --> 00:05:07,717
Can I ask you a question?

86
00:05:07,837 --> 00:05:11,314
I would prefer that you not,
but I won't go so far as to forbid it.

87
00:05:12,475 --> 00:05:14,150
All right, I heard yes, so...

88
00:05:15,454 --> 00:05:16,611
Here's my question.

89
00:05:17,265 --> 00:05:19,014
Has Leonard ever dated,

90
00:05:19,466 --> 00:05:21,511
you know, a regular girl?

91
00:05:23,075 --> 00:05:26,258
I assume you're not referring
to digestive regularity.

92
00:05:27,574 --> 00:05:30,875
Because I've come to learn
that such inquiries are inappropriate.

93
00:05:31,774 --> 00:05:34,616
No, I meant, has he ever been involved
with someone

94
00:05:34,736 --> 00:05:36,279
who wasn't a brainiac?

95
00:05:38,324 --> 00:05:40,262
A few years ago,
he did go out with a woman

96
00:05:40,382 --> 00:05:42,502
who had a PhD
in French literature.

97
00:05:44,148 --> 00:05:45,807
How is that not a brainiac?

98
00:05:46,264 --> 00:05:48,685
Well, for one thing, she was French.

99
00:05:50,808 --> 00:05:52,706
For another,
it was literature.

100
00:05:59,426 --> 00:06:00,426
So...

101
00:06:02,122 --> 00:06:04,301
Do you think that if
Leonard and I keep dating,

102
00:06:04,421 --> 00:06:06,558
he'll eventually
get bored with me?

103
00:06:13,041 --> 00:06:14,877
- That depends.
- On what?

104
00:06:15,681 --> 00:06:17,964
Do you have a working knowledge
of quantum physics?

105
00:06:19,589 --> 00:06:21,059
Do you speak Klingon?

106
00:06:23,648 --> 00:06:26,594
- You know any card tricks?
- Okay, you know what...

107
00:06:28,518 --> 00:06:31,166
I get it.
Leonard has no business being involved

108
00:06:31,286 --> 00:06:33,975
with a waitress-slash-actress
who felt so insecure

109
00:06:34,095 --> 00:06:37,108
that she lied to him
about finishing community college.

110
00:06:37,268 --> 00:06:38,818
Why would you lie about that?

111
00:06:38,978 --> 00:06:42,093
He was going on and on
about this college and that grad school,

112
00:06:42,213 --> 00:06:45,330
I didn't want him to think
I was some kind of stupid loser.

113
00:06:45,632 --> 00:06:47,579
You thought the opposite
of "stupid loser"

114
00:06:47,699 --> 00:06:49,746
was "community college graduate"?

115
00:06:54,781 --> 00:06:57,345
You know, there are a lot
of successful people in this country

116
00:06:57,465 --> 00:06:59,172
who are community college graduates.

117
00:06:59,481 --> 00:07:01,145
Yeah, but you are neither.

118
00:07:03,502 --> 00:07:04,431
Right.

119
00:07:04,551 --> 00:07:08,308
Okay, this is between you and me.
You cannot tell Leonard any of this.

120
00:07:10,293 --> 00:07:11,934
You're asking me to keep a secret?

121
00:07:13,384 --> 00:07:14,700
Well, I'm sorry,

122
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:17,844
but you would have had to express
that desire before revealing the secret,

123
00:07:17,964 --> 00:07:21,402
so I could've chosen if I wanted to
accept the covenant of secret keeping.

124
00:07:22,776 --> 00:07:25,699
You can't impose a secret
on an ex post facto basis.

125
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:28,368
What?

126
00:07:29,318 --> 00:07:31,620
Secret keeping
is a complicated endeavor.

127
00:07:31,782 --> 00:07:34,125
One has to be concerned
not only about what one says,

128
00:07:34,245 --> 00:07:36,834
but about facial expressions,
autonomic reflexes.

129
00:07:37,347 --> 00:07:40,465
When I try to deceive,
I myself have more nervous tics

130
00:07:40,585 --> 00:07:43,008
than a Lyme disease research facility.

131
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:49,965
It's a joke.

132
00:07:50,085 --> 00:07:51,921
It relies on the homonymic relationship

133
00:07:52,041 --> 00:07:53,967
between "tick,"
the bloodsucking arachnid,

134
00:07:54,087 --> 00:07:56,842
and "tic,"
the involuntary muscular contraction.

135
00:08:01,086 --> 00:08:02,500
I made it up myself.

136
00:08:05,246 --> 00:08:07,534
Okay, look, if Leonard
finds out that I lied,

137
00:08:07,654 --> 00:08:10,135
I will absolutely die
of embarrassment.

138
00:08:10,255 --> 00:08:13,162
- Physiologically impossible.
- Sheldon, please.

139
00:08:13,323 --> 00:08:15,331
Look, I am asking you as a friend.

140
00:08:16,776 --> 00:08:19,135
So you're saying that friendship
contains within it

141
00:08:19,255 --> 00:08:21,796
an inherent obligation
to maintain confidences?

142
00:08:22,051 --> 00:08:22,964
Yeah.

143
00:08:23,570 --> 00:08:24,682
Interesting.

144
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:28,344
One more question, and perhaps
I should have led with this.

145
00:08:28,645 --> 00:08:30,390
When did we become friends?

146
00:08:33,092 --> 00:08:35,088
... i.e., I couldn't
become Green Lantern

147
00:08:35,208 --> 00:08:37,173
unless I was chosen
by the Guardians of Oa,

148
00:08:37,293 --> 00:08:40,274
but given enough start-up capital
and an adequate research facility,

149
00:08:40,394 --> 00:08:41,853
I could be Batman.

150
00:08:46,358 --> 00:08:47,655
You could be Batman?

151
00:08:47,815 --> 00:08:49,795
Sure.
I'm Batman. See?

152
00:08:53,218 --> 00:08:55,014
- Hi, guys.
- Hi, Penny.

153
00:08:56,915 --> 00:09:00,451
If you're free Friday night,
I thought maybe we could go see a movie.

154
00:09:00,571 --> 00:09:03,296
Oh, you know, I think I have
the dinner shift on Friday.

155
00:09:03,617 --> 00:09:05,056
What about Saturday?

156
00:09:05,176 --> 00:09:08,306
I'm not sure; the manager
hasn't posted the schedule yet.

157
00:09:08,426 --> 00:09:10,391
- How about I let you know?
- Great.

158
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:12,930
So you just let me know
when you know.

159
00:09:13,090 --> 00:09:15,362
Okay, so...
Oh, God, I am the bad fish.

160
00:09:18,054 --> 00:09:19,353
What did I do wrong?

161
00:09:19,663 --> 00:09:21,147
Why are you asking me?

162
00:09:21,483 --> 00:09:23,778
I have no information
about your interactions with Penny

163
00:09:23,898 --> 00:09:25,579
other than what you have provided me,

164
00:09:25,699 --> 00:09:28,110
nor do I have any method
of learning such things.

165
00:09:30,552 --> 00:09:32,283
- What does that mean?
- Nothing.

166
00:09:32,603 --> 00:09:34,978
You seem to be implying
an informational back-channel

167
00:09:35,098 --> 00:09:37,290
between me and Penny
where obviously none exists.

168
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:38,539
No, I didn't.

169
00:09:38,699 --> 00:09:42,108
I just think you need to be careful
how you phrase things, sir.

170
00:09:44,663 --> 00:09:47,913
- What's going on with you?
- I might ask you the same question.

171
00:09:48,033 --> 00:09:49,785
Why are you attempting to drag me

172
00:09:49,905 --> 00:09:51,886
into matters which have nothing
to do with me,

173
00:09:52,046 --> 00:09:55,464
but exist between you and Penny,
a person to whom I barely speak?

174
00:10:03,895 --> 00:10:05,672
What's wrong with your face?

175
00:10:06,554 --> 00:10:09,203
There's no reason
to bring my looks into this.

176
00:10:10,898 --> 00:10:12,135
Good day, Leonard.

177
00:10:12,255 --> 00:10:14,500
- What?
- I said, "Good day."

178
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:19,532
"Good day"?

179
00:10:21,909 --> 00:10:24,339
Also today, we have
a fresh-caught Alaska salmon,

180
00:10:24,459 --> 00:10:26,907
and that's served
with a teriyaki glaze and sticky rice.

181
00:10:27,027 --> 00:10:29,632
- Our soup of the day is...
- You must release me from my oath.

182
00:10:33,088 --> 00:10:34,773
Sheldon, I'm working.

183
00:10:35,464 --> 00:10:38,380
- Why don't you take a minute to decide?
- Oh, my...

184
00:10:39,635 --> 00:10:41,173
I can't keep your secret.

185
00:10:41,293 --> 00:10:43,623
I'm going to fold
like an energy-based de novo protein

186
00:10:43,743 --> 00:10:45,358
in conformational space.

187
00:10:46,939 --> 00:10:48,578
Like a Renaissance tryptich.

188
00:10:49,145 --> 00:10:50,348
Like a cheap suit.

189
00:10:51,442 --> 00:10:54,407
Look, why is it so hard for you
to keep one little secret?

190
00:10:54,567 --> 00:10:57,661
I'm constitutionally incapable.
That's why I was refused clearance

191
00:10:57,781 --> 00:11:00,006
for a prestigious
government research fellowship

192
00:11:00,126 --> 00:11:01,763
at a secret military supercollider

193
00:11:01,883 --> 00:11:03,821
located beneath a fake
agricultural station

194
00:11:03,941 --> 00:11:06,696
12.5 miles southeast
of Traverse City, Michigan.

195
00:11:11,834 --> 00:11:13,941
Which you did not hear about
from me.

196
00:11:16,088 --> 00:11:18,004
Just forget I told you about me...

197
00:11:18,453 --> 00:11:21,475
- not graduating from community college.
- Forget?

198
00:11:21,635 --> 00:11:24,193
You want me to forget?
This mind does not forget.

199
00:11:24,773 --> 00:11:26,301
I haven't forgotten a single thing

200
00:11:26,421 --> 00:11:28,342
since my mother stopped
breastfeeding me.

201
00:11:30,033 --> 00:11:32,195
- It was a drizzly Tuesday.
- Okay...

202
00:11:32,996 --> 00:11:34,995
You promised me
you would keep my secret,

203
00:11:35,115 --> 00:11:37,033
so just figure out a way to do it.

204
00:11:39,064 --> 00:11:40,630
Leonard, I'm moving out.

205
00:11:42,679 --> 00:11:44,749
What do you mean, you're moving out?
Why?

206
00:11:45,083 --> 00:11:46,920
There doesn't have to be a reason.

207
00:11:48,797 --> 00:11:50,423
Yeah, there kinda does.

208
00:11:50,698 --> 00:11:51,863
Not necessarily.

209
00:11:51,983 --> 00:11:54,634
This is a classic example
of Munchausen's Trilemma.

210
00:11:54,794 --> 00:11:57,214
Either the reason is predicated
on a series of sub-reasons

211
00:11:57,334 --> 00:11:58,944
leading to an infinite regression,

212
00:11:59,064 --> 00:12:01,288
or it tracks back to arbitrary
axiomatic statements,

213
00:12:01,408 --> 00:12:02,816
or it's ultimately circular,

214
00:12:02,936 --> 00:12:05,313
i.e. I'm moving out
because I'm moving out.

215
00:12:08,070 --> 00:12:09,190
I'm still confused.

216
00:12:09,350 --> 00:12:12,044
Leonard, I don't see
how I could have made it any simpler.

217
00:12:13,516 --> 00:12:15,175
Hey, <i>qu'est-ce que s'up</i>?

218
00:12:17,149 --> 00:12:20,013
We just got back from that exhibit
of those plasticized human cadavers.

219
00:12:20,133 --> 00:12:22,605
And some of those skinless chicks
were hot!

220
00:12:24,574 --> 00:12:26,847
If you'll excuse me,
I'm going to pack.

221
00:12:28,357 --> 00:12:31,726
That's kind of an overreaction
to a little harmless necrophilia.

222
00:12:34,178 --> 00:12:36,926
It's not you, Howard.
He says he's moving out.

223
00:12:37,432 --> 00:12:38,776
What did you do?

224
00:12:39,286 --> 00:12:42,556
Did you change the contrast
or brightness settings on the TV?

225
00:12:43,634 --> 00:12:46,106
Did you take a Band-Aid off
in front of him?

226
00:12:47,555 --> 00:12:49,922
Did you buy generic ketchup,
forget to rinse the sink,

227
00:12:50,042 --> 00:12:52,066
talk to him
through the bathroom door?

228
00:12:53,477 --> 00:12:55,369
Adjust the thermostat,
cook with cilantro,

229
00:12:55,489 --> 00:12:56,968
pronounce the "t" in often?

230
00:13:00,931 --> 00:13:02,823
Did you make fun of trains?

231
00:13:05,270 --> 00:13:08,664
No, I didn't do anything.
He's just gone insane.

232
00:13:08,826 --> 00:13:10,751
We all knew this day was coming.

233
00:13:12,933 --> 00:13:14,107
That was fast.

234
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:17,358
It's my pre-packed disaster
evacuation bag.

235
00:13:18,836 --> 00:13:21,644
It's recommended by the Department
of Homeland Security.

236
00:13:22,045 --> 00:13:23,414
And Sarah Connor.

237
00:13:25,134 --> 00:13:26,673
Where are you going to live?

238
00:13:26,793 --> 00:13:29,812
Until I find a permanent place,
I will stay with friends.

239
00:13:30,165 --> 00:13:31,062
Bye.

240
00:13:35,019 --> 00:13:38,186
You can't stay with me.
I have a teeny-tiny apartment.

241
00:13:38,689 --> 00:13:42,365
Excuse me, but isn't hosting guests
an aspect of <i>manushya yajna</i>,

242
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:46,507
one of the five central religious duties
or sacrifices of the Hindu householder?

243
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:52,209
I hate trains.

244
00:13:58,484 --> 00:14:00,885
Don't be ridiculous,
you love trains.

245
00:14:02,285 --> 00:14:03,637
Yes, I do. Come on.

246
00:14:06,567 --> 00:14:07,946
See you later, Leonard.

247
00:14:14,688 --> 00:14:16,034
This could work.

248
00:14:26,195 --> 00:14:28,077
This is a very old building.

249
00:14:28,449 --> 00:14:30,687
60 years.
It used to be a watch factory.

250
00:14:32,237 --> 00:14:33,083
What?

251
00:14:33,243 --> 00:14:35,308
Don't you worry
about the residual radium

252
00:14:35,428 --> 00:14:36,985
from the luminous dials?

253
00:14:37,663 --> 00:14:39,042
Not until now!

254
00:14:40,751 --> 00:14:43,557
I can't believe I didn't bring
my Geiger counter.

255
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:46,588
I had it on my bed
and I didn't pack it.

256
00:14:47,589 --> 00:14:50,309
- If you're not comfortable staying...
- I'm kidding, I packed it.

257
00:14:52,096 --> 00:14:53,149
It was a joke.

258
00:14:53,269 --> 00:14:55,940
I was subverting
the conversational expectations.

259
00:14:56,244 --> 00:14:59,151
I believe they call that
the... ol' switcheroo.

260
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:02,200
Terrific.

261
00:15:06,453 --> 00:15:08,271
Is that woman Aishwarya Rai?

262
00:15:08,391 --> 00:15:10,153
Yes, isn't she an amazing actress?

263
00:15:10,273 --> 00:15:12,706
Actually, I'd say
she's a poor man's Madhuri Dixit.

264
00:15:14,018 --> 00:15:15,546
How dare you!

265
00:15:16,133 --> 00:15:18,127
Aishwarya Rai is a goddess.

266
00:15:18,247 --> 00:15:22,049
By comparison,
Madhuri Dixit is a leprous prostitute.

267
00:15:24,396 --> 00:15:26,053
Sorry, I didn't mean to offend you.

268
00:15:28,249 --> 00:15:30,933
Obviously, you're not that familiar
with Indian cinema.

269
00:15:39,828 --> 00:15:40,928
Who is it?

270
00:15:41,282 --> 00:15:42,628
Strip-o-Gram!

271
00:15:47,044 --> 00:15:48,385
Tag, you're it.

272
00:15:50,367 --> 00:15:52,483
Shouldn't you put him
in a brown paper bag

273
00:15:52,603 --> 00:15:54,037
and set him on fire?!

274
00:15:57,010 --> 00:15:59,517
I've never slept
on an air mattress before.

275
00:16:00,812 --> 00:16:02,470
No lumbar support whatsoever.

276
00:16:04,168 --> 00:16:07,248
Maybe you'd be happier
on a park bench.

277
00:16:08,624 --> 00:16:11,181
I don't see any way
to get a park bench in here.

278
00:16:12,217 --> 00:16:14,781
- Do you want to switch?
- No, that's fine.

279
00:16:14,901 --> 00:16:17,734
I'm perfectly comfortable
sleeping on a bouncy castle.

280
00:16:20,775 --> 00:16:23,360
- Get out of bed. We're switching.
- Only if you want to.

281
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:24,814
Just get in the bed!

282
00:16:25,434 --> 00:16:27,316
<i>What's going on?</i>

283
00:16:27,436 --> 00:16:29,813
<i>Are you boys roughhousing?</i>

284
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:33,537
We're just talking, Ma!

285
00:16:33,657 --> 00:16:35,997
<i>If you don't settle down right now,</i>

286
00:16:36,371 --> 00:16:40,163
<i>I'm not going to let you
have any more sleepovers!</i>

287
00:16:41,087 --> 00:16:44,143
For God's sake, Ma,
I'm 27 years old!

288
00:16:45,101 --> 00:16:47,176
And it's not even a school night!

289
00:16:51,967 --> 00:16:53,057
Comfy now?

290
00:16:59,133 --> 00:17:02,003
That poster of Halle Berry
is a little unnerving.

291
00:17:03,734 --> 00:17:05,485
So don't look at it.

292
00:17:05,605 --> 00:17:07,818
She's like
my fourth favorite Catwoman.

293
00:17:07,938 --> 00:17:08,864
No kidding.

294
00:17:09,024 --> 00:17:12,076
Yeah, Julie Newmar, Michelle Pfieffer,
Eartha Kitt, and then her.

295
00:17:12,528 --> 00:17:14,077
What about Lee Merriweather?

296
00:17:14,239 --> 00:17:16,213
I forgot about Lee Merriweather.

297
00:17:17,056 --> 00:17:18,621
I'm glad that's settled.

298
00:17:19,906 --> 00:17:22,576
That makes Halle Berry
my fifth favorite Catwoman.

299
00:17:22,996 --> 00:17:24,704
It's Julie Newmar, Michelle Pfieffer,

300
00:17:24,915 --> 00:17:28,467
- Eartha Kitt, Lee Merriweather...
- Please, I'm begging you. Go to sleep.

301
00:17:28,627 --> 00:17:31,084
I'm trying. I'm counting Catwomen.

302
00:17:36,033 --> 00:17:38,560
She did make a fine mutant
in the X-Men movies, though.

303
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:41,040
- For God's sake.
- She's not my favorite of the X-Men.

304
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:43,164
In order that would be:
Wolverine, Cyclops...

305
00:17:43,284 --> 00:17:44,525
I forgot Professor X.

306
00:17:44,685 --> 00:17:46,609
Professor X, Wolverine, Cyclops,

307
00:17:46,771 --> 00:17:49,048
Iceman, then Storm,
Angel, the Beast--

308
00:17:49,168 --> 00:17:50,531
No, wait, Nightcrawler.

309
00:17:51,181 --> 00:17:54,743
Professor X, Nightcrawler,
Wolverine, Cyclops, Iceman, Storm,

310
00:17:54,946 --> 00:17:55,946
Angel...

311
00:17:56,808 --> 00:17:57,963
I'm coming!

312
00:18:02,149 --> 00:18:03,293
There he is.

313
00:18:03,495 --> 00:18:05,629
There my old buddy bud bud.

314
00:18:11,695 --> 00:18:12,841
What's with him?

315
00:18:12,961 --> 00:18:15,458
Koothrappali dumped him on me,
and he couldn't get to sleep,

316
00:18:15,578 --> 00:18:17,191
so I gave him a glass of warm milk

317
00:18:17,311 --> 00:18:19,744
with a handful
of my mom's Valium in it...

318
00:18:21,814 --> 00:18:24,162
but he still wouldn't shut up,
so tag, you're it.

319
00:18:29,007 --> 00:18:30,265
I'm ba-ack.

320
00:18:32,199 --> 00:18:35,200
- I still don't know why you left.
- I can't tell you.

321
00:18:35,402 --> 00:18:36,402
Why not?

322
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:38,022
I promised Penny.

323
00:18:39,748 --> 00:18:41,332
You promised Penny what?

324
00:18:41,452 --> 00:18:43,382
I wouldn't tell you the secret.

325
00:18:47,915 --> 00:18:50,315
What secret?
Tell me the secret.

326
00:18:54,196 --> 00:18:56,022
Mom smokes in the car.

327
00:18:58,759 --> 00:19:01,602
Jesus is okay with it
but we can't tell Dad.

328
00:19:04,408 --> 00:19:06,855
Not that secret. The other secret.

329
00:19:07,017 --> 00:19:08,841
- I'm Batman!
- Damn it! Sheldon!

330
00:19:13,619 --> 00:19:17,075
You said Penny told you a secret.
What's the secret?

331
00:19:17,236 --> 00:19:18,802
Okay, I'll tell you,

332
00:19:18,922 --> 00:19:20,483
but you can't tell Leonard.

333
00:19:22,222 --> 00:19:23,359
I promise.

334
00:19:24,451 --> 00:19:27,067
Penny lied about graduating
from community college

335
00:19:27,187 --> 00:19:30,128
'cause she's afraid
she's not smart enough for Leonard.

336
00:19:34,751 --> 00:19:37,179
So it's nothing I did?
It's her problem?

337
00:19:38,152 --> 00:19:40,090
I drank milk that tasted funny.

338
00:19:44,882 --> 00:19:47,898
Penny thinks I'm too smart for her.
That's ridiculous.

339
00:19:48,058 --> 00:19:49,058
I know.

340
00:19:50,748 --> 00:19:53,329
Most of your work
is extremely derivative.

341
00:19:54,288 --> 00:19:56,549
And don't worry,
that's not a secret.

342
00:19:57,423 --> 00:19:58,692
Everybody knows.

343
00:20:04,342 --> 00:20:05,591
Hi. Yeah, hi.

344
00:20:05,711 --> 00:20:08,752
I know what's been bothering you
about us, and I have the answer.

345
00:20:08,913 --> 00:20:10,294
What are you talking about?

346
00:20:10,456 --> 00:20:12,582
First, I wanna say
that it's not Sheldon's fault.

347
00:20:12,702 --> 00:20:14,464
He tried very hard to keep your secret.

348
00:20:14,584 --> 00:20:17,680
If Howard hadn't drugged him,
he would've taken it to his grave.

349
00:20:18,629 --> 00:20:20,974
- He told you?
- Yes, but it's okay.

350
00:20:21,175 --> 00:20:23,891
Now that we know what the problem is
there's a simple solution.

351
00:20:25,265 --> 00:20:27,229
Pasadena City College?

352
00:20:27,613 --> 00:20:30,031
"A place for fun,
a place for knowledge."

353
00:20:33,850 --> 00:20:37,520
This man here is playing hackey-sack,
and this girl's gonna be a paralegal.

354
00:20:39,468 --> 00:20:40,577
Oh, I get it.

355
00:20:40,697 --> 00:20:42,325
Because Dr. Leonard Hofstadter

356
00:20:42,445 --> 00:20:45,246
can't date a girl
without a fancy college degree.

357
00:20:46,069 --> 00:20:48,957
It's really not that fancy.
It's just a city college.

358
00:20:50,043 --> 00:20:52,795
Right, but I have to have some
sort of degree to date you?

359
00:20:52,957 --> 00:20:54,507
That doesn't matter to me at all.

360
00:20:54,708 --> 00:20:57,425
So it's fine with you
if I'm not smart.

361
00:20:57,588 --> 00:20:58,709
Absolutely.

362
00:21:03,905 --> 00:21:06,337
Okay, this time,
I know where I went wrong.

363
00:21:09,478 --> 00:21:10,484
Bite me!
