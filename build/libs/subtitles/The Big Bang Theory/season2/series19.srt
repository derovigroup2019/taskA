1
00:00:01,051 --> 00:00:02,541
Okay, it's done.

2
00:00:02,752 --> 00:00:05,949
Look, guys, for the future,
I don't mind killing the big spiders...

3
00:00:06,156 --> 00:00:09,455
...but you have to at least try
with the little ones.

4
00:00:09,659 --> 00:00:13,789
Penny, please. We're facing a far more
serious problem than stray arachnids.

5
00:00:13,997 --> 00:00:17,831
- Sheldon, it's not that bad.
- Not bad? It's horrible.

6
00:00:18,034 --> 00:00:21,765
You hear stories about this sort of thing.
You never think it will happen to you.

7
00:00:21,971 --> 00:00:25,702
So they steamed your dumplings.
Get over it.

8
00:00:26,843 --> 00:00:28,743
New topic, please.

9
00:00:28,945 --> 00:00:32,142
All right, Penny.
Let me take this opportunity to point out...

10
00:00:32,348 --> 00:00:36,307
...that you are looking particularly
ravishing today.

11
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:40,318
Not with a thousand condoms, Howard.

12
00:00:42,325 --> 00:00:44,850
So there is a number.

13
00:00:46,062 --> 00:00:47,927
Okay. New topic, please.

14
00:00:48,131 --> 00:00:50,463
Hey, did you hear the people
in 5-A are moving out?

15
00:00:50,667 --> 00:00:53,033
- No. Shh-shh-shh!
- Why?

16
00:00:53,436 --> 00:00:55,961
- The people upstairs are moving out.
- No.

17
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:59,138
The horror.

18
00:00:59,743 --> 00:01:01,711
Why would you just say something
like that?

19
00:01:01,911 --> 00:01:05,176
- How else--?
- No, no, no.

20
00:01:05,615 --> 00:01:07,378
How else was I supposed to say it?

21
00:01:07,584 --> 00:01:12,044
Slowly. Like putting a new fish in a tank.
You don't just drop it in.

22
00:01:12,255 --> 00:01:16,282
You let the bag sit in the water
a while.

23
00:01:16,493 --> 00:01:18,586
The horror.

24
00:01:18,795 --> 00:01:22,287
- Sheldon, I'm sure it's gonna be fine.
- No, it's not going to be fine.

25
00:01:22,499 --> 00:01:26,265
Change is never fine.
They say it is, but it's not.

26
00:01:26,703 --> 00:01:29,297
Okay, did you even know the people
that are moving out?

27
00:01:29,506 --> 00:01:30,734
I never met them.

28
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:33,272
That's what made them perfect.

29
00:01:33,476 --> 00:01:35,410
There were no awkward hellos
in the halls.

30
00:01:35,612 --> 00:01:38,843
There's no clickety-clacking
of high-heel shoes on hardwood floors.

31
00:01:39,048 --> 00:01:43,849
They may as well have been a family of cats
just jumping around from drape to drape.

32
00:01:44,287 --> 00:01:47,518
And without that annoying
ammonia-urine smell.

33
00:01:49,025 --> 00:01:51,152
I'm sure the new people
will be just as quiet.

34
00:01:51,361 --> 00:01:54,159
You can't know that.
How can you possibly know that?

35
00:01:54,364 --> 00:01:57,822
You're right, I can't. You know what?
Anyone could rent that apartment now.

36
00:01:58,034 --> 00:02:00,901
An opera singer, the cast of <i>Stomp.</i>

37
00:02:03,306 --> 00:02:06,104
Yeah, a tap-dancing pirate
with a wooden leg.

38
00:02:07,844 --> 00:02:09,141
Why are you making it worse?

39
00:02:09,345 --> 00:02:12,314
I tried making it better,
he wouldn't go for it.

40
00:02:13,683 --> 00:02:15,810
- You're right. That's a great idea.
- What?

41
00:02:16,019 --> 00:02:19,011
I'll take the apartment.
I can finally get away from my mother...

42
00:02:19,222 --> 00:02:22,282
...and we can all spend
some more time together.

43
00:02:22,492 --> 00:02:24,722
If you catch my drift.

44
00:02:27,130 --> 00:02:29,291
The horror.

45
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:37,074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

46
00:02:54,257 --> 00:02:55,281
Hold on.

47
00:02:55,491 --> 00:02:58,517
Do you honestly expect me to believe
social protocol dictates...

48
00:02:58,728 --> 00:03:03,961
...we break our backs helping Wolowitz
move and then he only need buy us a pizza?

49
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:07,801
I'm sorry, that really is how it works.

50
00:03:08,004 --> 00:03:09,904
You're tricking me.

51
00:03:10,773 --> 00:03:13,105
- Tell me the truth, what do we get?
- Ha.

52
00:03:13,910 --> 00:03:15,502
Raj, help me out here.

53
00:03:15,712 --> 00:03:18,408
You get to choose
between a mountain bike or a PS3.

54
00:03:18,615 --> 00:03:20,344
I knew it.

55
00:03:21,618 --> 00:03:23,984
- PS3, definitely PS3.
- Mm-hm.

56
00:03:24,187 --> 00:03:25,677
Who would pick a mountain bike?

57
00:03:27,523 --> 00:03:31,220
Enough with the guilt, Ma.
We'll still see each other.

58
00:03:31,427 --> 00:03:33,827
I'll come over every night
and have dinner with you.

59
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:36,498
MRS. WOLOWITZ:
The hell you will!

60
00:03:36,699 --> 00:03:41,068
What am I running here,
a fancy restaurant?

61
00:03:41,271 --> 00:03:43,466
Does this look like Olive Garden?

62
00:03:45,575 --> 00:03:47,065
Okay, I get it, you're angry.

63
00:03:47,277 --> 00:03:50,371
You don't wanna see
your little bird leave the nest.

64
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:53,879
MRS. WOLOWITZ:
Little bird? You're almost 30!

65
00:03:54,684 --> 00:03:57,517
Fly for God's sake.

66
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:00,120
Fine, I'll stay. You happy, crazy lady?

67
00:04:00,323 --> 00:04:02,791
I sure as hell hope so,
because you're ruining my life!

68
00:04:05,895 --> 00:04:09,626
Hey, Penny, it's Leonard. Good news,
you can take your head out of the oven.

69
00:04:11,234 --> 00:04:13,065
I guess I won't be needing this.

70
00:04:18,207 --> 00:04:20,835
Oh, no.

71
00:04:21,311 --> 00:04:23,973
The new ones.

72
00:04:24,514 --> 00:04:27,244
They're here.

73
00:04:28,318 --> 00:04:30,786
Stay calm.
We don't know anything about them yet.

74
00:04:34,223 --> 00:04:37,852
- What are you doing?
- I'm checking for musical instruments.

75
00:04:39,095 --> 00:04:41,655
Does that sound like castanets to you?

76
00:04:42,098 --> 00:04:43,429
The box says "kitchen."

77
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,265
So? Do cocaine smugglers
write "cocaine" on the box?

78
00:04:50,206 --> 00:04:51,867
- Hello?
- Hello.

79
00:04:52,075 --> 00:04:53,406
- Hello.
- Hello.

80
00:04:53,609 --> 00:04:56,100
- Hello.
- Hello.

81
00:04:56,879 --> 00:04:59,313
I'm Alicia. I'm moving in upstairs.

82
00:04:59,515 --> 00:05:01,312
That is so great.

83
00:05:02,852 --> 00:05:04,979
Oh, I'm Leonard. I live downstairs.

84
00:05:05,188 --> 00:05:07,053
Upstairs from here, but under you.

85
00:05:07,256 --> 00:05:10,453
Not under you per se...

86
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:12,890
...but under your apartment. Heh-heh.

87
00:05:13,062 --> 00:05:16,225
- That's nice.
- Yeah, it is.

88
00:05:17,633 --> 00:05:21,194
Well, that concludes your faltering attempt
to mate.

89
00:05:23,873 --> 00:05:25,363
- Hello.
- Hello.

90
00:05:25,575 --> 00:05:27,167
Hello.

91
00:05:29,178 --> 00:05:32,636
On a scale of one to ten, how light
of foot would you describe yourself...

92
00:05:32,849 --> 00:05:37,650
...with one being not cat-like at all,
and ten being freakishly feline?

93
00:05:37,854 --> 00:05:39,583
Freakishly feline?

94
00:05:40,023 --> 00:05:42,685
Is that your answer
or do you not understand the question?

95
00:05:43,826 --> 00:05:45,589
- We'll come back to that one.
- Sheldon.

96
00:05:45,795 --> 00:05:51,825
Hang on. Are you now or have you ever
been a salsa, Irish-folk or breakdancer?

97
00:05:52,668 --> 00:05:54,568
- No.
- You're making her uncomfortable.

98
00:05:54,771 --> 00:05:56,238
Did--? Oh, I'm sorry.

99
00:05:56,439 --> 00:06:00,273
Well, if it helps you feel any better,
you're doing very well so far.

100
00:06:00,510 --> 00:06:03,070
Next question. Are you fertile?

101
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:05,604
- What?
- I'm trying to determine...

102
00:06:05,815 --> 00:06:08,306
...whether crying infants are a possibility.

103
00:06:08,518 --> 00:06:12,648
- I have no immediate plans.
- lf that changes, let me know.

104
00:06:12,855 --> 00:06:16,256
- And finally, area rugs, pro or con?
- Pro?

105
00:06:16,459 --> 00:06:17,653
- Alicia?
- Yes?

106
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:19,088
Welcome to the building.

107
00:06:28,104 --> 00:06:31,096
Thanks so much for helping me, Leonard.

108
00:06:31,307 --> 00:06:34,936
Thank you so much for giving me
the opportunity to help.

109
00:06:35,778 --> 00:06:37,439
Oh, hey, guys.

110
00:06:37,647 --> 00:06:40,172
- Penny, this is Alicia, our new neighbor.
- Hi.

111
00:06:40,383 --> 00:06:41,441
Hi.

112
00:06:41,651 --> 00:06:43,516
I'm helping.

113
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:45,747
I can see.

114
00:06:45,955 --> 00:06:49,891
Alicia's non-musical,
childless and pro-rug.

115
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:54,361
She's still on probation, of course,
but I like her.

116
00:06:54,564 --> 00:06:55,792
Cool T-shirt.

117
00:06:55,998 --> 00:06:59,525
Oh, yeah, I don't usually dress like this.
I'm going jogging.

118
00:06:59,735 --> 00:07:02,431
- You don't jog.
- I can start.

119
00:07:02,905 --> 00:07:07,035
The more likely explanation for your attire
is that you're out of clean clothes again.

120
00:07:07,243 --> 00:07:09,507
- Thank you, Sheldon.
- You're welcome, Penny.

121
00:07:10,913 --> 00:07:13,939
Please, you look cute.
I'm dressed like a slob today too.

122
00:07:14,117 --> 00:07:15,209
Oh, ha, ha.

123
00:07:15,384 --> 00:07:17,909
I think you look fantastic.

124
00:07:18,121 --> 00:07:22,785
- This one's a player, huh?
- Oh, yeah, be careful.

125
00:07:22,992 --> 00:07:24,391
- Thanks for the warning.
- Okay.

126
00:07:24,594 --> 00:07:26,824
- I'll see you around.
- See you.

127
00:07:30,299 --> 00:07:32,426
"I'm dressed like a slob today too."

128
00:07:32,602 --> 00:07:34,467
Oh, mimicry.

129
00:07:34,670 --> 00:07:35,694
I enjoy mimicry.

130
00:07:35,905 --> 00:07:39,033
I've been working on Admiral Ackbar
from <i>Return of the Jedi.</i>

131
00:07:40,176 --> 00:07:42,269
It's a trap.

132
00:07:44,747 --> 00:07:47,614
You have to imagine me
with a giant squid head.

133
00:07:53,489 --> 00:07:55,457
It's a trap.

134
00:07:59,295 --> 00:08:01,092
It's a trap.

135
00:08:03,132 --> 00:08:04,793
It's a trap.

136
00:08:28,524 --> 00:08:30,116
Come.

137
00:08:30,459 --> 00:08:34,327
- Hey.
- Congratulations, I see you did your laundry.

138
00:08:34,964 --> 00:08:35,988
Well, sort of.

139
00:08:36,199 --> 00:08:38,997
- How does one sort of--?
- I bought new clothes, okay?

140
00:08:40,102 --> 00:08:42,366
- Is Leonard around?
- He's upstairs at Alicia's.

141
00:08:42,872 --> 00:08:44,965
Oh, all right, that's cool, no biggie.

142
00:08:45,174 --> 00:08:48,371
He said he'd help me set up my printer,
but I guess I can wait.

143
00:08:48,578 --> 00:08:50,045
What exactly is he doing there?

144
00:08:50,479 --> 00:08:53,539
In what I can only perceive
as a tactical move to destroy me...

145
00:08:53,749 --> 00:08:57,185
...he is with Wolowitz and Koothrappali
setting up her stereo.

146
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:00,684
Oh, they're all up there, huh?
Hmm. Typical.

147
00:09:02,058 --> 00:09:04,026
It's axiomatically atypical.

148
00:09:05,194 --> 00:09:09,494
Until recently, they did not know Alicia, and
had no encounters in a previous location.

149
00:09:09,699 --> 00:09:11,929
They never went
to visit the former tenants.

150
00:09:12,134 --> 00:09:16,537
So your characterization of their behavior
as typical is demonstrably fallacious.

151
00:09:19,208 --> 00:09:21,802
Okay, now I see the giant squid head.

152
00:09:28,951 --> 00:09:31,886
Oh, great.
Now I have to start all over again.

153
00:09:33,956 --> 00:09:36,083
Yeah, I thought about renting
this apartment...

154
00:09:36,292 --> 00:09:40,524
...but I'm really more of a downtown-loft
kind of guy.

155
00:09:40,730 --> 00:09:42,527
Cool. So are you in a loft now?

156
00:09:42,732 --> 00:09:46,133
Oh, actually I'm living
with a woman in Altadena.

157
00:09:46,335 --> 00:09:49,133
Purely platonic. She's also my maid. Heh.

158
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:53,400
- Sounds like a sweet deal.
- Well, I won't lie. It's pretty dope.

159
00:09:55,611 --> 00:09:57,408
Hello?

160
00:09:58,147 --> 00:09:59,171
Oh, hey.

161
00:09:59,382 --> 00:10:01,714
Hi. I just wanted to bring you
a housewarming gift.

162
00:10:01,917 --> 00:10:03,316
That is so sweet.

163
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:05,487
- Come on in. Let's open it.
- Great.

164
00:10:05,688 --> 00:10:09,647
- Nice dress.
- Oh, this? I'm dressed like a slob today.

165
00:10:11,427 --> 00:10:14,055
The guys have been helping me
set up my sound system.

166
00:10:14,263 --> 00:10:16,754
I've never had
such good-looking technical support.

167
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:20,334
Oh, pish posh.

168
00:10:21,704 --> 00:10:24,764
I don't know. It means shucks.

169
00:10:24,974 --> 00:10:29,138
Shucks means shucks.
Let one go once in a while.

170
00:10:29,979 --> 00:10:32,004
Penny,
you wanna hear something awesome?

171
00:10:32,214 --> 00:10:35,012
- Yeah.
- Alicia is an actress just like you.

172
00:10:35,751 --> 00:10:38,185
That is so awesome.

173
00:10:39,455 --> 00:10:42,549
- Well, trying to be, but it's so hard.
- I know, tell me about it.

174
00:10:42,758 --> 00:10:45,955
I've been here three months.
All I've gotten is a couple commercials.

175
00:10:46,162 --> 00:10:48,130
And this recurring thing on a soap.

176
00:10:51,067 --> 00:10:55,299
That's why I work at The Cheesecake
Factory. I'm holding out for the right part.

177
00:10:59,542 --> 00:11:03,308
Alicia, what do you want as your default
setting for DVDs, 5.1 Dolby or DTS?

178
00:11:03,979 --> 00:11:05,970
Whatever you think is best, cutie.

179
00:11:09,418 --> 00:11:12,319
Well, DTS has more low-end...

180
00:11:13,723 --> 00:11:15,156
...so okay.

181
00:11:17,326 --> 00:11:21,854
Hey, guys, you will really appreciate this.
I read the best science joke on the internet.

182
00:11:22,064 --> 00:11:24,760
Alicia, you won't get it,
but it's right up their alley.

183
00:11:24,967 --> 00:11:28,164
Anyway, so this physicist goes
into an ice cream parlor every week...

184
00:11:28,371 --> 00:11:30,362
...orders an ice cream sundae
for himself...

185
00:11:30,573 --> 00:11:32,837
...and offers one to the empty stool
next to him.

186
00:11:33,042 --> 00:11:35,840
This goes on until the owner
asks him what he's doing.

187
00:11:36,045 --> 00:11:38,411
The man says, "Well, I'm a physicist...

188
00:11:38,614 --> 00:11:42,015
...and quantum mechanics teaches us...

189
00:11:43,085 --> 00:11:45,713
...that it is possible
for the matter above this stool...

190
00:11:45,921 --> 00:11:48,185
...to spontaneously turn
into a beautiful woman...

191
00:11:48,391 --> 00:11:50,757
...who might accept my offer
and fall in love."

192
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:53,656
The owner then says,
"Lots of women come in here every day.

193
00:11:53,863 --> 00:11:57,162
Why don't you buy an ice cream for them,
and they might fall in love?"

194
00:11:57,366 --> 00:11:58,594
And the physicist says:

195
00:11:58,801 --> 00:12:01,861
"Yeah, but what are
the odds of that happening?" Ha.

196
00:12:06,976 --> 00:12:09,376
That's a little insulting, don't you think?

197
00:12:09,845 --> 00:12:12,712
How would I know?
I'm not even sure I get it.

198
00:12:14,383 --> 00:12:15,907
Hey, Leonard?

199
00:12:16,118 --> 00:12:19,053
If you're done with the DVD player,
can you set up my printer?

200
00:12:19,255 --> 00:12:20,552
Oh, yeah, I'd love to.

201
00:12:22,291 --> 00:12:24,919
When you're done with her printer,
you could set up mine.

202
00:12:25,127 --> 00:12:27,425
You know, like you promised,
a week ago?

203
00:12:27,630 --> 00:12:29,427
Yeah, I'll get to it. Don't nag me.

204
00:12:33,269 --> 00:12:35,260
Hello, there.

205
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:53,379
Who is it?

206
00:12:55,357 --> 00:12:58,849
Oh, hello, Penny. It's open. Come in.

207
00:13:01,230 --> 00:13:03,255
Sarcasm.

208
00:13:04,533 --> 00:13:07,559
- Well, they're all still up there.
- You think I can't hear them?

209
00:13:07,770 --> 00:13:10,864
Listen to that. Stomp, stomp, stomp.

210
00:13:11,073 --> 00:13:14,531
It's Wolowitz in his stacked heels
that fool no one.

211
00:13:15,778 --> 00:13:18,679
I don't even know why I care.
I don't care.

212
00:13:18,881 --> 00:13:22,681
All right, I cared enough to memorize
that stupid joke, but that's all I care.

213
00:13:23,719 --> 00:13:24,845
You know, Penny...

214
00:13:25,054 --> 00:13:28,615
...there's something that occurs in beehives
you might find interesting.

215
00:13:28,824 --> 00:13:34,023
Occasionally, a new queen will arrive
while the old queen is still in power.

216
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:38,326
When this happens, the old queen
must either locate to a new hive...

217
00:13:38,534 --> 00:13:44,495
...or engage in a battle to the death
until only one queen remains.

218
00:13:46,208 --> 00:13:48,802
What are you saying?
That I'm threatened by Alicia?

219
00:13:49,011 --> 00:13:52,777
That I'm like the old queen of the hive,
and it's just time for me to go?

220
00:13:52,982 --> 00:13:55,746
I'm just talking about bees.

221
00:13:55,951 --> 00:13:58,579
They're on The Discovery Channel.

222
00:13:59,455 --> 00:14:01,923
What are you talking about?

223
00:14:03,492 --> 00:14:04,925
Bees.

224
00:14:09,098 --> 00:14:11,760
I just got that physicist joke.

225
00:14:14,937 --> 00:14:17,565
- Gee, Penny, thanks for buying us dinner.
- Mm-hm.

226
00:14:17,773 --> 00:14:19,638
- Yeah, what's the occasion?
- No occasion.

227
00:14:19,842 --> 00:14:23,107
Just felt like getting some Chinese chow
for my peeps.

228
00:14:24,613 --> 00:14:27,605
Did you remember to ask for the chicken
to be diced not shredded?

229
00:14:27,816 --> 00:14:29,647
Even though the menu
specifies shredded?

230
00:14:29,852 --> 00:14:32,821
Brown rice, not white? Stop at the grocery
and get the mustard?

231
00:14:33,022 --> 00:14:35,422
Pick up the low-sodium soy sauce
from the market?

232
00:14:35,624 --> 00:14:36,852
Good.

233
00:14:39,194 --> 00:14:40,491
See how it's done, Leonard?

234
00:14:43,699 --> 00:14:45,166
What do we got going on tonight?

235
00:14:45,367 --> 00:14:49,531
Playing Halo? Watching <i>Battlestar?</i>
Drop some Mentos in Diet Coke?

236
00:14:50,739 --> 00:14:52,104
You wanna watch <i>Battlestar?</i>

237
00:14:52,308 --> 00:14:55,800
What can I say? I got my geek on, boys.

238
00:14:58,113 --> 00:15:01,879
No, no, PMS is different.

239
00:15:03,852 --> 00:15:05,615
Thank God you're home. I need help.

240
00:15:05,821 --> 00:15:08,346
- What's wrong?
- I got a callback to audition for <i>CSI...</i>

241
00:15:08,557 --> 00:15:12,550
- ...to play a hooker who gets killed.
- Oh, I'd watch that.

242
00:15:13,729 --> 00:15:17,392
But my car is in the shop
and I have to be at Universal in 45 minutes.

243
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:20,728
- Okay, well, I'll take you.
- Oh, you're a lifesaver.

244
00:15:20,936 --> 00:15:23,131
- I'll run lines with you in the car.
- Great.

245
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:25,967
And afterward,
I'll take you all out for Chinese.

246
00:15:26,175 --> 00:15:29,576
- Actually, that's okay. We already have--
- I'm starving.

247
00:15:31,981 --> 00:15:35,007
--Chinese food right here.

248
00:15:35,618 --> 00:15:38,178
They're gone, Penny.
They can't hear you.

249
00:15:40,122 --> 00:15:43,319
I cannot believe they're letting her
just use them like that.

250
00:15:43,525 --> 00:15:46,653
Anything she wants,
they go panting after her like trained dogs.

251
00:15:46,862 --> 00:15:49,626
Just last week, she had Howard
drive to her uncle's house...

252
00:15:49,832 --> 00:15:51,800
...in Orange County to pick up her TV?

253
00:15:52,267 --> 00:15:56,363
You once had Leonard and me
get your television from your ex-boyfriend.

254
00:15:57,673 --> 00:16:00,039
Apples and oranges here, Sheldon.

255
00:16:01,110 --> 00:16:04,546
I'm telling you, that girl is a user,
skating through life on her looks...

256
00:16:04,747 --> 00:16:06,510
...taking advantage of innocent men...

257
00:16:06,715 --> 00:16:09,343
...getting auditions
for stupid network shows.

258
00:16:09,551 --> 00:16:12,076
It just creams my corn.

259
00:16:14,423 --> 00:16:16,391
- May I interject something here?
- Please.

260
00:16:16,592 --> 00:16:18,219
You got the wrong mustard.

261
00:16:21,864 --> 00:16:24,731
- Hi.
- Hi.

262
00:16:24,933 --> 00:16:27,527
Guess what? I got the part on <i>CSI.</i>

263
00:16:27,736 --> 00:16:30,034
Oh, boy.

264
00:16:30,939 --> 00:16:32,031
Something wrong?

265
00:16:32,241 --> 00:16:34,209
No, no, no.
You know what? Congratulations.

266
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:37,208
I think you'll make a great hooker.

267
00:16:38,047 --> 00:16:39,241
Thank you.

268
00:16:39,882 --> 00:16:42,510
Hey, I gotta ask you something.

269
00:16:42,718 --> 00:16:44,686
How much do physicists make?

270
00:16:45,788 --> 00:16:47,483
Um.... Ah.

271
00:16:47,656 --> 00:16:49,749
I don't know. I don't think a lot.

272
00:16:49,958 --> 00:16:51,585
Yeah, that's what I figured.

273
00:16:54,163 --> 00:16:55,562
Well, gotta run.

274
00:16:55,764 --> 00:16:59,222
The guys promised to set up
my satellite dish and paint my bedroom.

275
00:16:59,401 --> 00:17:00,698
Yay.

276
00:17:01,236 --> 00:17:03,796
Hey. Hey, can I talk to you about that
for a second?

277
00:17:04,006 --> 00:17:05,098
About what?

278
00:17:05,841 --> 00:17:09,402
Well, you know,
it's just that Leonard and Howard and Raj...

279
00:17:09,611 --> 00:17:11,135
...they aren't like other guys.

280
00:17:11,747 --> 00:17:13,044
They're special.

281
00:17:13,482 --> 00:17:16,178
Okay, they're special, and....?

282
00:17:16,952 --> 00:17:19,785
Let's see. How can I explain this?

283
00:17:20,055 --> 00:17:23,456
- They don't know how to use their shields.
- Shields?

284
00:17:23,659 --> 00:17:27,459
Yeah, you know, like in <i>Star Trek</i> when
you're in battle and you raise the shields?

285
00:17:31,734 --> 00:17:34,032
Where the hell did that come from?

286
00:17:35,337 --> 00:17:38,329
Anyways,
you know how guys like this are.

287
00:17:39,308 --> 00:17:42,141
So please don't take advantage of them.

288
00:17:43,345 --> 00:17:45,973
Who says I'm taking advantage of them?

289
00:17:46,682 --> 00:17:50,641
Come on, they're doing everything for you
because you're leading them on.

290
00:17:50,853 --> 00:17:52,616
So I let them do stuff for me.

291
00:17:52,821 --> 00:17:54,448
They're happy, I get stuff.

292
00:17:54,656 --> 00:17:57,591
Who cares? And how is it
any different from what you do?

293
00:18:00,195 --> 00:18:02,163
Excuse me?

294
00:18:02,364 --> 00:18:03,729
I've seen you around them.

295
00:18:03,932 --> 00:18:07,060
Are you pretending
like you don't do the exact same thing?

296
00:18:07,269 --> 00:18:11,399
Okay, lady, you are way out of line.

297
00:18:11,874 --> 00:18:15,469
- Oh, I'm out of line?
- Yeah, you're out of line.

298
00:18:15,677 --> 00:18:19,704
Well, what are you gonna do about it,
bitch?

299
00:18:23,185 --> 00:18:24,584
I like Green Lantern.

300
00:18:24,787 --> 00:18:28,917
I'm just saying it's pretty lame
that he can be defeated by the color yellow.

301
00:18:29,124 --> 00:18:32,389
Only the modern Green Lantern
is vulnerable to yellow.

302
00:18:32,594 --> 00:18:34,789
Golden-age Green Lantern
was vulnerable to wood.

303
00:18:34,997 --> 00:18:38,228
Great, so I can take them both out
with a number two pencil?

304
00:18:43,672 --> 00:18:47,608
Oh, my God. Girl fight!

305
00:18:48,110 --> 00:18:49,134
What are you doing?

306
00:18:49,344 --> 00:18:51,744
I know you.
You're stupid enough to break it up.

307
00:19:03,292 --> 00:19:06,318
May I say you look very comely tonight?

308
00:19:06,962 --> 00:19:08,623
Thank you.

309
00:19:09,665 --> 00:19:12,395
You're right. This filly's been broken.

310
00:19:19,107 --> 00:19:21,940
You set it on DTS, didn't you?

311
00:19:22,144 --> 00:19:25,409
I had to. She called me cutie.

312
00:19:26,949 --> 00:19:28,814
According to Alicia's Facebook page...

313
00:19:29,017 --> 00:19:32,214
...she's hooking up
with one of the producers on <i>CSI.</i>

314
00:19:32,421 --> 00:19:36,255
Well, dead whore on TV,
live one in real life.

315
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,433
Oh, great.

316
00:19:47,002 --> 00:19:49,994
Now she's jumping up and down
on the bed.

317
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:53,908
<i>Wow.</i>
