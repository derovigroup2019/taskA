1
00:00:02,030 --> 00:00:05,200
Worst. renaissance. fair. ever.

2
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:08,930
Please let it go, sheldon.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,100
It was rife with historical inaccuracies.

4
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:15,030
For example, the tavern girl serving flagons of mead.

5
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:17,300
Her costume was obviously germanic.

6
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:20,330
But in 1487, the bavarian purity laws,

7
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:21,930
Or "reinheitsgebot,"

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,360
Severely limited the availability of mead.

9
00:00:24,430 --> 00:00:26,460
At best, they would have had some sort of spiced wine.

10
00:00:26,530 --> 00:00:27,960
You're nitpicking.

11
00:00:28,030 --> 00:00:29,460
Oh, really?

12
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:31,460
Well here is another nit for you.The flagons

13
00:00:31,530 --> 00:00:33,800
Would not have been made of polypropylene.

14
00:00:33,860 --> 00:00:37,600
Renaissance fairs aren't about historical accuracy.

15
00:00:37,660 --> 00:00:40,360
They're about taking chubby girls who work at kinko's

16
00:00:40,430 --> 00:00:42,300
And lacing them up in corsets so tight

17
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:46,000
Their bosom jumps out and says, "howdy."

18
00:00:46,060 --> 00:00:48,730
Bosoms would not have said "howdy" in the 15th century.

19
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:51,230
If anything, they would've said, "huzzah."

20
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:53,560
I don't care what the bosoms say, sheldon.

21
00:00:53,630 --> 00:00:56,300
I just want to be part of the conversation.

22
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:58,200
Hi, guys.

23
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:00,460
Looks like you've been to the renaissance fair...

24
00:01:00,530 --> 00:01:02,630
I'm hoping.

25
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:04,160
Renaissance fair?

26
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:06,400
More of a medieval, slash, age of enlightenment,

27
00:01:06,460 --> 00:01:09,660
Slash, any-excuse- to-wear-a-codpiece fair.

28
00:01:09,730 --> 00:01:11,030
Okay, fine, whatever.

29
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:12,400
You guys, this is my friend eric.

30
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:20,530
So, yeah, good to see you.

31
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,260
It's good to see you, too.

32
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:26,100
We should probably go.

33
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:27,930
Bye, guys.

34
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,300
I like your hat.

35
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:32,860
Thanks, my mom made it.

36
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:38,600
Penny with a new guy, tres awkward.

37
00:01:38,660 --> 00:01:42,460
It wasn't awkward.

38
00:01:42,530 --> 00:01:44,560
It wasn't fun.

39
00:01:44,630 --> 00:01:46,160
Besides, what's the big deal?

40
00:01:46,230 --> 00:01:49,060
We dated, we stopped dating, and now we're both moving on.

41
00:01:49,130 --> 00:01:50,260
By moving on,

42
00:01:50,330 --> 00:01:52,100
Do you mean she's going out with other men

43
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:53,230
And you spent the afternoon

44
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:55,760
Making 15th-century soap with wolowitz?

45
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:58,630
That was not 15th century soap.

46
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:00,630
My god, those people need to learn

47
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:02,830
You can't just put "ye olde" in front of anything you want

48
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:04,930
And expect to get away with it.

49
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,100
Can we please just go in?

50
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:08,260
My chain mail's stuck in my underwear.

51
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:12,130
You're wearing modern underwear?

52
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:14,930
Relatively modern.

53
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:17,300
Why, what are you wearing?

54
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,300
I fashioned historically accurate undergarments

55
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:21,260
Out of linen.

56
00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:22,760
You went out and bought linen?

57
00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:24,930
Don't be silly-- I borrowed one of your pillowcases.

58
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:30,660
Borrowed?

59
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,160
You know what,I'm happy that Penny's moving on.

60
00:02:55,230 --> 00:02:57,200
It gives me the freedom to move on myself.

61
00:02:57,260 --> 00:03:00,530
Are you saying that you've been holding back?

62
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:02,600
Of course.

63
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:04,060
Out of respect.

64
00:03:04,130 --> 00:03:08,230
So, how do you explain the ten years before penny?

65
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:11,900
Who were you respecting then?

66
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:14,130
Well, I've dated plenty of women.

67
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:16,000
There was joyce kim...

68
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:19,730
Leslie winkle...

69
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:22,630
Notify the editors of the oxford english dictionary.

70
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:25,560
The word "plenty" has been redefined to mean "two."

71
00:03:27,830 --> 00:03:29,600
What about that girl last year at comic-con?

72
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:30,630
Doesn't count.

73
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:31,830
Why not?

74
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:33,460
What happens in costume at comic-con

75
00:03:33,530 --> 00:03:35,560
Stays at comic-con.

76
00:03:35,630 --> 00:03:36,660
You're only saying that

77
00:03:36,730 --> 00:03:38,160
Because of what happened to you.

78
00:03:38,230 --> 00:03:39,230
What happened to you?

79
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:40,800
Nothing happened to me.

80
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:42,630
It wasn't your fault, raj.

81
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:45,860
He was dressed as a green orion slave girl.

82
00:03:47,330 --> 00:03:48,700
How did we get on me?!

83
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:50,030
We were mocking leonard for not moving on.

84
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:52,630
Dude, you have totally not moved on.

85
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:54,000
Yes, I have.

86
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:55,800
It's just a matter of actually making

87
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:57,760
A date with someone. like who?

88
00:03:57,830 --> 00:04:00,560
Well... there's joyce kim.

89
00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:03,130
But she defected back to north korea,

90
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:07,360
So that's a little geographically undesirable.

91
00:04:07,430 --> 00:04:08,700
What about leslie winkle?

92
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:11,960
Oh, no. why?

93
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:13,900
Her research methodology is sloppy,

94
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:16,630
She's unjustifiably arrogant about loop quantum gravity,

95
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:19,060
And to make matters worse, she's often mean to me.

96
00:04:20,830 --> 00:04:21,930
I think she's smoking hot.

97
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,100
I'd hit that.

98
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:25,360
You'd hit particulate soil

99
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:28,760
In a colloidal suspension.

100
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:30,360
Mud.

101
00:04:32,330 --> 00:04:34,160
Look, I like leslie, but she's not interested

102
00:04:34,230 --> 00:04:37,960
In dating as much as using men as tools for stress release.

103
00:04:38,030 --> 00:04:40,000
Yeah, so? be a tool.

104
00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:44,300
Go get yourself a little rebound "stress release."

105
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:46,460
Technically, it would only be rebound if he and penny

106
00:04:46,530 --> 00:04:48,360
Had actually engaged in physical intimacy.

107
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:51,700
You mean like you and richard the slave girl?

108
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:54,730
I bought him dinner and we kissed once!

109
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,900
That was it.

110
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,960
And he told me his name was kimberly.

111
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:06,930
You know how I know we're not in the matrix?

112
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:12,360
How?

113
00:05:12,430 --> 00:05:16,130
If we were, the food would be better.

114
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:18,160
Hey, Leonard.

115
00:05:18,230 --> 00:05:19,260
Hey, Leslie.

116
00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:21,260
Hey, dummy.

117
00:05:21,330 --> 00:05:22,760
Hello, to you...

118
00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:25,700
Insufficiently intelligent person.

119
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:28,960
Ooh, rush me to the burn unit.

120
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:32,830
Hey, Leonard, do you have a second?

121
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:34,260
-I need to ask you something. -sure.

122
00:05:34,330 --> 00:05:36,460
Well, if you'll excuse me,

123
00:05:36,530 --> 00:05:38,730
I'm going to go do work that promises

124
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:41,760
Significant results, as opposed to what you do...

125
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:43,830
Which does not.

126
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:47,730
Yeah, you heard me.

127
00:06:01,330 --> 00:06:04,530
So, I heard your relationship with Penny crashed to the ground

128
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:07,400
Like blue ice falling out of an airplane lavatory.

129
00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:09,860
Where did you hear that?

130
00:06:09,930 --> 00:06:12,800
Actually, I read it. Wolowitz texted me.

131
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:17,030
"like blue ice falling out of an airplane lavatory," yeah.

132
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:19,160
I thought it was a pretty good one. I gave him an lol.

133
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:22,600
Anyway, it got me thinking.

134
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:24,000
Now that you're unattached,

135
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:26,560
Maybe we can revisit our previous attachment.

136
00:06:26,630 --> 00:06:30,160
Are you suggesting another bout of stress release?

137
00:06:30,230 --> 00:06:31,760
No, I'm all done with casual sex.

138
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:33,060
From now on, I'm fully committed

139
00:06:33,130 --> 00:06:34,900
To the traditional relationship paradigm.

140
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:36,100
Really? what changed?

141
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:37,630
It's hard to say.

142
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:39,200
I guess there's just a time in every woman's life

143
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:41,160
When she gets tired of waking up on a strange futon

144
00:06:41,230 --> 00:06:44,060
With a bunch of people she doesn't know.

145
00:06:44,130 --> 00:06:48,400
Yeah, I can see how that would-- a bunch of people?

146
00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:50,260
Anyway, I figure it's time to slow things down

147
00:06:50,330 --> 00:06:53,660
And who better to slow things down with than you?

148
00:06:53,730 --> 00:06:56,630
Oh... I'm flattered.

149
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:01,260
So how do you suggest we proceed?

150
00:07:01,330 --> 00:07:02,860
Your place, we'll order chinese, you'll rent a movie--

151
00:07:02,930 --> 00:07:06,130
Artsy, but accessible-- then light petting, no coitus.

152
00:07:07,630 --> 00:07:09,700
Sounds fun.

153
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:11,200
I'll leave the details up to you.

154
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:14,000
I think it's better if you assume the male role.

155
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:17,630
Thank you, that's very thoughtful.

156
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:19,760
Great.

157
00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:21,630
Call me.

158
00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:28,530
Great news.

159
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:31,000
My mom sent me my old nintendo 64.

160
00:07:34,030 --> 00:07:36,000
-Terrific -you know what this means, don't you?

161
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:37,530
Break out the red bull,

162
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:39,960
It's time to rock mario, old school.

163
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:43,300
I kind of have other plans tonight.

164
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,500
But it's friday.

165
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,100
Friday's always vintage game night.

166
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:48,430
Look, mom included the memory card.

167
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:50,560
We can pick up right where I left off in 1999

168
00:07:50,630 --> 00:07:52,800
When I had pernicious anemia.

169
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:54,960
Well, the thing is, someone's coming over.

170
00:07:55,030 --> 00:07:56,560
Okay, no problem. I have three controllers.

171
00:07:56,630 --> 00:07:58,730
The more the merrier.

172
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,060
Sheldon, it's a date.

173
00:08:00,130 --> 00:08:01,230
I have a date coming over.

174
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,360
Well, you can't blame me for not jumping to that conclusion.

175
00:08:08,130 --> 00:08:10,830
Why? what's so unusual about me having a date?

176
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:11,900
Well, statistically speaking...

177
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:13,730
All right, all right.

178
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,330
Well, nevertheles, I have one now

179
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:17,230
And I'd appreciate it if you would, you know,

180
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:18,500
Make yourself scarce.

181
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:21,130
Leonard, I'm a published theoretical physicist

182
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:22,530
With two doctorates and an iq

183
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:24,400
Which can't be accurely measured by normal tests.

184
00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:26,460
How much scarcer could I be?

185
00:08:27,730 --> 00:08:29,030
You know what I mean.

186
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:30,500
Could you just give us a little privacy?

187
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:33,760
-You want me to leave the apartment? -yes.

188
00:08:33,830 --> 00:08:36,260
You mean, just go someplace else and be...

189
00:08:36,330 --> 00:08:38,030
Someplace else?

190
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:39,730
Yes.

191
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:41,630
Well, why should I leave? this is my apartment, too.

192
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:44,430
I know it is, and if science ever discovers a second member

193
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:46,500
Of your species and you two would like some privacy,

194
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:49,260
I'd be more than happy to get out of your way.

195
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:52,060
Well, all right then.

196
00:08:57,030 --> 00:08:59,800
Sheldon, what are you doing?

197
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:02,430
Playing super mario on a poorly coded

198
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:05,460
Nintendo 64 emulator.

199
00:09:05,530 --> 00:09:07,760
Yeah, but why are you doing it on the stairs?

200
00:09:07,830 --> 00:09:09,630
I am a modern day napoleon

201
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:11,800
Exiled to the elba of the staircase

202
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:14,830
Because Leonard, get this, has a date.

203
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:18,630
Oh. oh, well, good for him.

204
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:20,160
Yeah, but why are you sitting here?

205
00:09:20,230 --> 00:09:21,560
Why don't you just go to a movie or something?

206
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,600
Alone?

207
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:25,600
Yeah, why not?

208
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:27,460
What if I choke on my popcorn?

209
00:09:27,530 --> 00:09:29,660
Who will administer the heimlich maneuver?

210
00:09:29,730 --> 00:09:31,930
Well, then don't order popcorn.

211
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
No popcorn at the mov... listen to yourself.

212
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,300
Why don't you go to a coffee shop?

213
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:38,330
I don't drink coffee.

214
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:39,500
They have other things.

215
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:42,430
What do they have?

216
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:45,000
I don't know. you know, cookies, pastries...

217
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:47,260
-Pastries such as bear claws? -Yeah, sure.

218
00:09:47,330 --> 00:09:49,200
I don't like bear claws.

219
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:51,760
Hey, penny.

220
00:09:51,830 --> 00:09:54,030
Dumbass.

221
00:09:55,060 --> 00:09:56,930
Leslie winkle.

222
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,760
Of all the overrated physicists

223
00:09:58,830 --> 00:10:00,430
In all the labs in all the world,

224
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:03,300
Why does it have to be leslie winkle?

225
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:05,430
Well, they have a lot in common.

226
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:06,860
I mean, they're both scientists.

227
00:10:06,930 --> 00:10:08,560
Oh, please. the only way she could make

228
00:10:08,630 --> 00:10:10,030
A contribution to science would be

229
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:12,830
If they resumed sending chimps into space.

230
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:15,630
Okay, well, I have a date, too,

231
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:16,800
So I'll see ya.

232
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:21,630
Everybody has a date.

233
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:25,960
Even you, mario, going after princess peach.

234
00:10:26,030 --> 00:10:27,460
And what am I doing?

235
00:10:27,530 --> 00:10:29,530
I'm just enabling you.

236
00:10:34,930 --> 00:10:36,030
Yeah, it's from chang's.

237
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:37,530
Not chow's? no, chang's.

238
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:38,530
What happened to chow's?

239
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:39,960
It changed.

240
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:45,360
So, how many children do you think we should have?

241
00:10:47,630 --> 00:10:50,760
I'm sorry. that was a little abrupt.

242
00:10:50,830 --> 00:10:52,230
A little?

243
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:54,260
I mean, there are so many things to talk about

244
00:10:54,330 --> 00:10:55,430
Before we discuss reproduction.

245
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:57,760
I sure hope so.

246
00:10:57,830 --> 00:10:59,430
Besides shortness,

247
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:02,200
What genetic weaknesses run in your family?

248
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:04,430
Sorry to interrupt.

249
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:06,830
Battery's dying. continue.

250
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:10,400
Uh, genetic weakness, right.

251
00:11:10,460 --> 00:11:12,060
Uh, there's the lactose intolerance.

252
00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:14,900
Don't forget the male-pattern baldness.

253
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:17,260
When his uncles sit around the dinner table,

254
00:11:17,330 --> 00:11:19,900
They look like a half carton of eggs.

255
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:41,860
Okay, yeah, my uncles are bald, but my aunt edna

256
00:11:41,930 --> 00:11:45,230
Is one of the hairiest women you'll ever meet, so...

257
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:46,600
Sweet lady.

258
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:51,100
Always tickles when she hugs me.

259
00:11:53,030 --> 00:11:54,900
What now?

260
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:57,460
I have to make pee-pee.

261
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:05,160
Listen, I'm sorry about all of sheldon's interruptions.

262
00:12:05,230 --> 00:12:07,100
He can be a bit of an eccentric.

263
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:09,430
If by "eccentric" you mean passive-aggressive

264
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:11,430
East texas blowhole, I agree.

265
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:15,130
I think tonight was a very good start.

266
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,400
Me, too.

267
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:18,100
Are you sure you're okay postponing intercourse

268
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:21,400
Until our relationship is past the initial viability test?

269
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:22,800
No, problem.

270
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:24,960
I'm very skilled at postponing intercourse.

271
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:28,200
I guess I'll call you

272
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:30,000
And we'll arrange another evening.

273
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:32,260
Yes, I believe protocol dictates that you wait a minimum

274
00:12:32,330 --> 00:12:33,630
Of 18 hours before you call

275
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:36,460
So I'm not repulsed by your cloying eagerness.

276
00:12:36,530 --> 00:12:37,660
Sure.

277
00:12:37,730 --> 00:12:39,930
Again, it's your decision. you're the man.

278
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,330
It wasn't my cat.

279
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:42,700
It was an experiment

280
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:45,030
Designed by this guy named schroedinger.

281
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:49,100
From the charlie brown cartoons?

282
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:51,200
No, he was some kind of scientist.

283
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:52,830
Let me start again.

284
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:54,500
Oh, hey, leonard.

285
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:55,530
Hello.

286
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:56,530
Leslie.

287
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:57,930
Hi.

288
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:03,600
Okay, well, good night.

289
00:13:06,430 --> 00:13:07,830
Okay, well, good night.

290
00:13:10,730 --> 00:13:12,160
That ain't gonna make your point.

291
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:27,200
That's enough.

292
00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:30,600
Call me.

293
00:13:32,630 --> 00:13:34,600
Right.

294
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:37,060
Okay, good night.

295
00:13:37,130 --> 00:13:37,930
Uh, what?

296
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,700
Had a great time. ciao.

297
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:45,430
I'm sorry, I am not going back to the renaissance fair.

298
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:46,960
Come on, sheldon.

299
00:13:47,030 --> 00:13:51,400
There's so few places I can wear my jester costume.

300
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:54,330
I don't care. there are far too many historical anomalies

301
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:55,660
For my comfort.

302
00:13:55,730 --> 00:13:57,330
Okay, how about this?

303
00:13:57,400 --> 00:14:00,060
You can go dressed as a star trek science officer

304
00:14:00,130 --> 00:14:04,060
Exploring a planet similar to earth in the 1500s.

305
00:14:04,130 --> 00:14:05,860
You mean, like spock?

306
00:14:05,930 --> 00:14:07,400
Sure.

307
00:14:07,460 --> 00:14:10,900
Fascinating.

308
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:13,900
Hey, fellow scientists...

309
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:15,560
Sheldon.

310
00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:20,130
Why don't we all move over there so leslie can join us?

311
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:21,460
Yeah, let's do it.

312
00:14:26,930 --> 00:14:29,230
If you're having trouble deciding where to sit,

313
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:31,000
May I suggest one potato, two potato?

314
00:14:31,060 --> 00:14:32,400
Or as I call it,

315
00:14:32,460 --> 00:14:35,000
"the leslie winkle experimental methodology."

316
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:39,100
Don't make this hard for me.

317
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:40,460
It's not hard.

318
00:14:40,530 --> 00:14:42,500
It's simple. you can either sit with me,

319
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:44,030
Your friend, colleague and roommate

320
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:45,960
Or you can sit with an overrated scientist

321
00:14:46,030 --> 00:14:48,230
You might have sex with.

322
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:50,260
You're right, it is simple.

323
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:57,630
Hey, sheldon.

324
00:14:57,700 --> 00:14:59,000
Penny.

325
00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:01,330
Third floor tonight-- mixing it up?

326
00:15:05,530 --> 00:15:06,860
I still don't understand why

327
00:15:06,930 --> 00:15:08,130
You don't just go to dinner or something.

328
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:09,430
All right,

329
00:15:09,530 --> 00:15:11,230
Let's say I go to dinner alone,

330
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:13,560
And during the meal, I have to use the restroom.

331
00:15:13,630 --> 00:15:16,900
How do I know someone's not touching my food?

332
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:20,930
Good night, sheldon.

333
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,760
Penny, hold on.

334
00:15:24,830 --> 00:15:27,360
Are you sure things can't work out with you and leonard?

335
00:15:27,430 --> 00:15:28,630
Excuse me?

336
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:29,960
I'm just wondering

337
00:15:30,030 --> 00:15:32,630
If you really gave it the old college try.

338
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:36,800
Or in your case, the old community college try.

339
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:40,860
Okay, where is this coming from?

340
00:15:40,930 --> 00:15:44,900
Leonard is upstairs right now with my archenemy.

341
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:46,660
Your archenemy?

342
00:15:46,730 --> 00:15:49,460
Yes, the dr. doom to my mr. fantastic.

343
00:15:49,530 --> 00:15:51,460
Dr. octopus to my spider-man,

344
00:15:51,530 --> 00:15:53,300
The dr. sivana to my captain marvel.

345
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:55,200
I get it, I get it, I get it.

346
00:15:55,260 --> 00:15:57,100
Do you know, it's amazing how many supervillains

347
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:58,360
Have advanced degrees.

348
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:01,530
Graduate school should probably do a better job

349
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:03,300
Of screening those people out.

350
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:05,330
Sheldon, come back. you're losing me.

351
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:06,860
It's leslie winkle, penny.

352
00:16:06,930 --> 00:16:08,860
She belittles my research.

353
00:16:08,930 --> 00:16:11,230
Oh, sweetie, I'm sorry.

354
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:13,600
She called me "dumbass."

355
00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:15,830
I know. I heard.

356
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:18,360
Given this situation, I have no choice

357
00:16:18,430 --> 00:16:20,200
But to withdraw my previous objections

358
00:16:20,260 --> 00:16:23,660
To your ill-considered relationship with leonard.

359
00:16:23,730 --> 00:16:27,000
Oh, gee, well, thank you for that.

360
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:28,330
But I think for now,

361
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:30,230
Leonard and I are just gonna stay friends.

362
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:33,200
No, that response is unacceptable to me.

363
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:35,200
Sheldon, you are a smart guy.

364
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:37,800
You must know... I'm "smart"?

365
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:41,960
I'd have to lose 60 iq points to be classified as "smart."

366
00:16:42,030 --> 00:16:43,330
Are you gonna let me talk?

367
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:44,930
I'm sorry.

368
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,760
You must know that if leonard and leslie want to be together,

369
00:16:47,830 --> 00:16:49,660
Nothing you can do is gonna stop it.

370
00:16:49,730 --> 00:16:54,260
You continue to underestimate my capabilities, madam.

371
00:16:54,330 --> 00:16:56,330
Okay, let me put it this way.

372
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:58,930
If you're really leonard's friend, you will support him

373
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,630
No matter who he wants to be with.

374
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:02,400
Wait a minute.

375
00:17:02,460 --> 00:17:04,900
Why am I doing all the giving here?

376
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:07,400
If leonard's really my friend,

377
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:08,730
Why doesn't he have to support me

378
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:10,660
An my hatred of leslie winkle?

379
00:17:10,730 --> 00:17:15,030
Because love trumps hate.

380
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:18,100
Oh, now you're just making stuff up.

381
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:20,700
Okay, good night, sheldon.

382
00:17:22,830 --> 00:17:26,160
Oh, mario, if only I could control everyone

383
00:17:26,230 --> 00:17:29,000
The way I control you.

384
00:17:29,060 --> 00:17:33,560
Hop, you little plumber, hop, hop, hop.

385
00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:39,900
When the two of you reach a natural stopping point,

386
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:42,200
I'd like to have a word.

387
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:45,200
The word is "pee-pee." just do it.

388
00:17:49,530 --> 00:17:51,660
Leonard, you're my friend,

389
00:17:51,730 --> 00:17:54,200
And friends support their friends...

390
00:17:54,260 --> 00:17:55,530
Apparently.

391
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:58,530
So I'm withdrawing my objection to your desire

392
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:00,330
To have a relationship with leslie.

393
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:02,160
Thank you.

394
00:18:02,230 --> 00:18:03,760
I will graciously

395
00:18:03,830 --> 00:18:05,400
Overlook the fact that she is an arrogant,

396
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:08,900
Subpar scientist who actually believes loop quantum gravity

397
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:11,330
Better unites quantum mechanics with generally relativity

398
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:12,700
Than does string theory.

399
00:18:13,830 --> 00:18:15,300
You kids have fun.

400
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:17,460
Hang on a second.

401
00:18:18,730 --> 00:18:20,830
Loop quantum gravity clearly offers more testable predictions

402
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:22,160
Than string theory.

403
00:18:22,230 --> 00:18:25,600
I'm listening. amuse me.

404
00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:28,830
Okay, well, for one thing, we expect quantized space-time

405
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:30,400
To manifest itself as minute differences

406
00:18:30,460 --> 00:18:32,100
In the speed of light for different colors.

407
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:36,700
Balderdash. matter clearly consists of tiny strings.

408
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:40,700
Are you gonna let him talk to me like that?

409
00:18:44,430 --> 00:18:48,330
Okay, well, there is a lot of merit to both theories.

410
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:49,660
No, there isn't. only loop quantum gravity

411
00:18:49,730 --> 00:18:51,800
Calculates the entropy of black holes.

412
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:58,160
Sheldon, don't make that noise. it's disrespectful.

413
00:18:58,230 --> 00:18:59,260
I should hope so.

414
00:18:59,330 --> 00:19:00,960
It was a snort of derision.

415
00:19:01,030 --> 00:19:03,030
You agree with me, right?

416
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:05,830
Loop quantum gravity is the future of physics.

417
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:11,200
Sorry, leslie, I guess I prefer my space stringy, not loopy.

418
00:19:11,260 --> 00:19:12,730
I'm glad I found out the truth about you

419
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:14,600
Before this went any further.

420
00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:16,600
Truth? what truth?

421
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:18,500
We're talking about untested hypotheses.

422
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:19,660
It's no big deal.

423
00:19:19,730 --> 00:19:21,230
It isn't? really?

424
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:23,730
Tell me, leonard, how will we raise the children?

425
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:28,630
I... I guess we wait until they're old enough

426
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:31,000
And let them choose their own theory.

427
00:19:31,060 --> 00:19:33,100
We can't let them choose, leonard. they're children!

428
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:36,730
Wait. where are you going?

429
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:39,460
I'm sorry.

430
00:19:39,530 --> 00:19:41,300
I could have accepted our kids being

431
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:42,960
Genetically unable to eat ice cream

432
00:19:43,030 --> 00:19:45,560
Or ever get a good view of a parade.

433
00:19:46,930 --> 00:19:48,200
But this?

434
00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:50,260
This is a deal breaker.

435
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:07,060
-Look on the bright side. -What's the bright side?

436
00:20:07,130 --> 00:20:10,200
Only nine more months to comic-con.

437
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:12,400
Oh, yeah.

438
00:20:24,530 --> 00:20:28,300
Captain, I'm getting an unusual reading.

439
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:29,500
Yeah, that's great.

440
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:30,730
You guys want a corn dog?

441
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:32,160
Yeah.

442
00:20:32,230 --> 00:20:34,230
That's a temporal anomaly.

443
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:36,160
Corn dog's didn't come into existence

444
00:20:36,230 --> 00:20:38,460
Till the first half of the 20th century.
