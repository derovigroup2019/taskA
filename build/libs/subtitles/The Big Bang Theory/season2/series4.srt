00:00:04,671 --> 00:00:07,548
- I'm the dumplings.
- Yes, you are.

3
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:10,426
Creepy, Howard.

4
00:00:10,593 --> 00:00:12,094
Creepy good or creepy bad?

5
00:00:13,471 --> 00:00:16,181
- Who was the shrimp with lobster sauce?
- That would be me.

6
00:00:16,349 --> 00:00:19,893
Come to Papa, you un-kosher delight.

7
00:00:20,645 --> 00:00:23,105
I'm not necessarily talking to the food.

Sit over there.

9
00:00:34,993 --> 00:00:36,744
Sit over there.

10
00:00:46,129 --> 00:00:48,422
- Baby wipe?
- Why do you have...?

11
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:50,466
- No, don't ask.
- No, don't, don't.

12
00:00:51,634 --> 00:00:52,676

[BOTH SIGH]

14
00:00:54,137 --> 00:00:56,638
I had to sanitize my hands
because the university...

15
00:00:56,806 --> 00:00:59,933
...replaced the paper towels
in the restrooms with hot-air blowers.

16
00:01:00,101 --> 00:01:02,144
I thought the blowers were more sanitary.

17
00:01:02,312 --> 00:01:03,687
- Why?
- Really, don't.

18
00:01:04,064 --> 00:01:08,442
Hot-air blowers are incubators
and spewers of bacteria and pestilence.

19
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:11,403
It'd be more hygienic
if they had a plague-infested gibbon...

...sneeze my hands dry.

21
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:17,242
Hey, guys.
I just got the most amazing new...

00:01:19,704 --> 00:01:23,373
Do you think you'll ever be able to talk
in front of me without being drunk?

23
00:01:26,211 --> 00:01:29,213
Okay, well, I'll just go eat by myself.

24
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:31,298
- You don't have to do that.
- It's okay.

him talking, and him...

- So, what's your news?

I spotted beyond the Kuiper belt?

Oh, yeah, 2008-NQ sub-17.

31
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:57,199
Or as I call it, Planet Bollywood.

00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:02,830
...People magazine is naming me
one of their 30 Under 30 to Watch.

34
00:02:02,997 --> 00:02:05,958
- Raj, that's incredible.
- Congratulations.

35
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:11,463
Excuse me, 30 what under 30 what
to watch what?

36
00:02:11,881 --> 00:02:14,299
Thirty visionaries
under 30 years of age to watch...

37
00:02:14,467 --> 00:02:17,678
...as they challenge
the preconceptions of the fields.

38

If I had a million guesses,
I never would have gotten that.

00:02:21,933 --> 00:02:25,310
They've got me in with a guy doing
something about hunger in Indonesia...

...a psychotherapist using dolphins
to rehabilitate prisoners...

41
00:02:28,731 --> 00:02:33,360
...and Ellen Page,
star of the charming independent film Juno.

42
00:02:33,778 --> 00:02:36,572
Oh, I'd so do her.

43
00:02:38,032 --> 00:02:40,450
You'd do the dolphins.

44
00:02:41,119 --> 00:02:42,202
Do I get a mention...

45
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:45,247
...for designing the telescope camera
mounting bracket?

46
00:02:45,415 --> 00:02:48,458
Sorry, it's not part of my heartwarming
and personal narrative...

47
00:02:48,626 --> 00:02:50,794
...in which a humble boy
from New Delhi...

48
00:02:50,962 --> 00:02:55,382
...overcame poverty and prejudice and
journeyed to America to reach for the stars.

49
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:59,136
Poverty? Your father's a gynecologist.
He drives a Bentley.

50
00:03:00,096 --> 00:03:01,471
It's a lease.

51
00:03:04,642 --> 00:03:08,604
I'm confused. Was there
some sort of peer-review committee...

52
00:03:08,771 --> 00:03:11,106
...to determine which scientists
would be included?

53
00:03:11,274 --> 00:03:14,985
Peer review? It's People magazine.
People picked me.

54
00:03:15,445 --> 00:03:18,238
- What people?
- The people from People.

55
00:03:18,406 --> 00:03:20,824
What? Yeah, but exactly
who are these people?

56
00:03:20,992 --> 00:03:23,660
What are their credentials?
How are they qualified?

57
00:03:23,828 --> 00:03:26,246
What makes accidentally noticing
a hunk of rock...

...that's been traipsing around
the solar system for billions of years...

59
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:34,213
...more noteworthy than any other scientific
accomplishment by someone under 30?

60
00:03:34,672 --> 00:03:38,133

aren't giving her this kind of crap.

Oh, good,

We're gonna apologize to Raj
and invite him out to dinner.

69
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:37,734
Apologize? For what?

70
00:04:37,902 --> 00:04:42,114

good news and we weren't very supportive.

71

to tell me something.

I was by far the most supportive.

Really? Do tell.

00:04:57,755 --> 00:05:01,425
How will Raj ever reach true greatness
if his friends lower the bar for him?

77
00:05:01,884 --> 00:05:06,054
When I was 11, my sister bought our father
a "world's greatest dad" coffee mug.

78
00:05:06,222 --> 00:05:09,391
And frankly, the man coasted
until the day he died.

00:05:10,893 --> 00:05:12,394
Okay, let's try it this way.

80
00:05:12,562 --> 00:05:15,814

is the best Raj is going to achieve?

81
00:05:17,567 --> 00:05:20,527
- I had not considered that.
- Mm-hm. Come on.

- He can feel sadness?
- Not really.

85
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,163
It's what you and I call condescension.

00:05:32,957 --> 00:05:36,084
Now, when we go in there,
let's show Raj that we're happy for him.

that stupid little clump of cosmic schmutz.

- I'd rather have Fishbein's. It's bigger.
GABLEHAUSER: Done.

00:07:27,071 --> 00:07:29,072
Wait, I called dibs on Fishbein's office...

00:10:14,113 --> 00:10:18,241
...they kill him and drive away evil spirits
with a drum made of his skin.

166
00:10:18,409 --> 00:10:22,912
Superstitious nonsense, of course,
but one can see their point.

167
00:10:29,587 --> 00:10:32,505
Here you go, Raj.
You might wanna drink this one slowly.

168
00:10:32,673 --> 00:10:35,925
Okay. So Saturday night,
can I count on my posse?

169
00:10:36,093 --> 00:10:39,304
Gee, I'd love to, Raj, but I can't make it.

170
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:40,889
Oh, okay. Leonard?

171
00:10:41,599 --> 00:10:43,141
Well, uh...

172
00:10:43,726 --> 00:10:46,686
No, I could... No.

173
00:10:47,563 --> 00:10:50,940
- Sheldon?
- I can make it, but I won't.

174
00:10:51,609 --> 00:10:55,403
- What are you talking about?
- The reception for my article on Saturday.

175
00:10:55,571 --> 00:10:56,613
You guys aren't going?

176
00:10:57,782 --> 00:11:00,909
I can't believe you. Raj is celebrating
a tremendous accomplishment.

177
00:11:01,077 --> 00:11:02,577
You're not gonna be there?

178
00:11:02,745 --> 00:11:06,206
A tremendous accomplishment would be
if the planetary body he discovered...

179
00:11:06,374 --> 00:11:09,668
...were plummeting toward Earth
and he exploded it with his mind.

180
00:11:11,295 --> 00:11:14,130
That would be cool.
I'd go to that reception.

181
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:17,467
Come on, this is huge.
Raj is gonna be in People magazine...

182
00:11:17,635 --> 00:11:20,970
...and he didn't even have to knock up
one of the Spears sisters.

183
00:11:21,889 --> 00:11:23,932
Would you like to go with me?

184
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:26,184
Of course I would. I would be honored.

185
00:11:26,352 --> 00:11:27,727
Really? Cool.

186
00:11:27,895 --> 00:11:30,063
Shame on you guys.

187
00:11:32,817 --> 00:11:35,777
Look at that, I got a date with Penny.

188
00:11:36,237 --> 00:11:38,238
I can't believe it took you a whole year.

189
00:11:40,241 --> 00:11:41,825
- Now?
- Now.

190
00:11:47,289 --> 00:11:50,458
Hey, buddy.
I'm gonna be in People magazine.

191
00:11:50,626 --> 00:11:53,294
Yeah, call me when you're on the cover.

192
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:06,433
Oh, Raj, look at you.

193
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:11,146
I know. I'm resplendent
like the noonday sun, am I not?

194
00:12:12,148 --> 00:12:15,567
Um, yeah. Starting with the champagne
a little early, aren't you?

195
00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:18,570
It was in the limo.
They sent a limo. I have a limo.

196
00:12:18,738 --> 00:12:21,281
I just love saying "limo." Here.

197
00:12:21,699 --> 00:12:24,409
- Sip on this while you're getting ready.
- Oh, I'm ready.

198
00:12:25,119 --> 00:12:26,870
That's what you're wearing?

199
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:30,832
Um, yeah. Why? What's wrong with it?

200
00:12:31,208 --> 00:12:36,713
Nothing. I was just hoping for something
a little more, you know, ridonkulous.

201
00:12:42,845 --> 00:12:47,015
Yeah. Well, this is all the "donkulous"
you're gonna get tonight.

202
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:50,226
Okey-dokey. Let's roll.

203
00:12:50,394 --> 00:12:53,021
All right, it's time to raise the roof.
Ooh-ooh.

204
00:12:54,565 --> 00:12:55,690
Hey, Leonard.

205
00:12:55,858 --> 00:12:56,941
- Hey.
- Dude.

206
00:12:57,109 --> 00:13:00,695
- You look very nice.
BOTH: Thank you.

207
00:13:02,406 --> 00:13:04,365
- Come on. Good night, Leonard.
- Good night.

208
00:13:04,533 --> 00:13:08,203
- Leonard, did you see my limo downstairs?
- Yeah.

209
00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:10,955
It's bigger than the house
my grandfather grew up in.

210
00:13:11,123 --> 00:13:12,791
- Terrific.
- It has more food too.

211
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:15,376
All right. Come on, come on.

212
00:13:15,544 --> 00:13:17,378
RAJESH [SINGING]:
I'm coming up

213
00:13:17,546 --> 00:13:19,881
So you better get this party started

214
00:13:20,049 --> 00:13:22,717
I'm coming up
I'm coming up, yeah

215
00:13:22,885 --> 00:13:26,888
I'm coming up
So you better get this party started

216
00:13:27,056 --> 00:13:28,431
- Hey.
- Hey, good news.

217
00:13:28,599 --> 00:13:30,642
You don't have to sulk
about Penny anymore.

218
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:35,063
There are hundreds of Croatian women
just waiting for you to contact them.

219
00:13:35,439 --> 00:13:38,942
"Anything-for-a-Green-Card.com"?

220
00:13:40,569 --> 00:13:44,322
I'll lend you my username.
It's Wealthy Big Penis.

221
00:13:45,741 --> 00:13:48,243
- You're joking.
- You gotta make it easy for them.

222
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:50,578
They're just learning English.

223
00:13:51,413 --> 00:13:52,497
Pass.

224
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:54,833
You're just gonna
sit around here and mope...

225
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,753
...while Penny is out with Dr. Apu
from the Kwik-E-Mart?

226
00:13:59,171 --> 00:14:01,923
It's not a date and that's racist.

227
00:14:02,091 --> 00:14:06,427
It can't be racist.
He's a beloved character on The Simpsons.

228
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:09,138
Let's just eat so I can get to bed.

229
00:14:09,306 --> 00:14:13,184
With any luck, tonight will be the night
my sleep apnea kills me.

230
00:14:16,981 --> 00:14:19,440
Did you ask for the chicken to be diced,
not shredded?

231
00:14:19,608 --> 00:14:21,776
- Yes.
- Even though the menu specifies shredded?

232
00:14:21,944 --> 00:14:23,361
- Yes.
- Brown rice, not white?

233
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:25,864
- Yes.
- Did you stop and get the hot mustard?

234
00:14:26,031 --> 00:14:28,157
- Yes.
- Did you pick up the low-sodium soy sauce?

235
00:14:28,325 --> 00:14:29,742
- Yes.
- Thank you.

236
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:31,452
You're welcome.

237
00:14:32,288 --> 00:14:33,413
What took you so long?

238
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:38,293
- Just sit down and eat.
- Fine.

239
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:43,965
All right, it's shredded.
What do you want me to do?

240
00:14:44,133 --> 00:14:46,301
I want you to check
before you accept the order.

241
00:14:46,468 --> 00:14:48,094
Sorry.

242
00:14:48,971 --> 00:14:50,722
Were you distracted
by the possibility...

243
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:53,725
...that Koothrappali might have intercourse
with Penny tonight?

244
00:14:56,312 --> 00:14:58,396
He's not going to have intercourse
with Penny.

245
00:14:58,564 --> 00:15:00,481
Then there's no excuse for this chicken.

246
00:15:02,568 --> 00:15:07,572
You know, this situation with Koothrappali
brings to mind a story from my childhood.

247
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:10,658
Oh, goody,
more tales from the panhandle.

248
00:15:10,826 --> 00:15:13,953
That's Northwest Texas.
I'm from East Texas, the Gulf region...

249
00:15:14,121 --> 00:15:16,915
...home to many Vietnamese shrimpers.

250
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:19,584
Do the shrimpers feature in your story?

251
00:15:20,669 --> 00:15:22,086
No.

252
00:15:22,838 --> 00:15:25,214
Anyway, when I was 8...

253
00:15:25,382 --> 00:15:30,094
...a Montgomery Ward delivery van
ran over our family cat, Lucky.

254
00:15:31,555 --> 00:15:33,431
- "Lucky"?
- Yes, "Lucky."

255
00:15:33,599 --> 00:15:36,267
He's irony impaired. Just move on.

256
00:15:37,019 --> 00:15:39,854
Okay, dead cat named Lucky. Continue.

257
00:15:40,022 --> 00:15:41,689
While others mourned Lucky...

258
00:15:41,857 --> 00:15:46,152
...I realized his untimely demise provided
me with the opportunity to replace him...

259
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,613
...with something
more suited to my pet needs.

260
00:15:48,781 --> 00:15:51,449
A faithful companion
that I could snuggle with at night...

261
00:15:51,617 --> 00:15:55,536
...yet would be capable of killing
upon telepathic command.

262
00:15:57,414 --> 00:15:59,666
So not a puppy?

263
00:15:59,875 --> 00:16:01,668
Please. No, nothing so pedestrian.

264
00:16:01,835 --> 00:16:04,462
I wanted a griffin.

265
00:16:05,381 --> 00:16:09,133
- A griffin?
- Yes, half eagle, half lion.

266
00:16:09,927 --> 00:16:12,303
And mythological.

267
00:16:13,097 --> 00:16:14,472
Irrelevant.

268
00:16:15,307 --> 00:16:17,558
Yeah, I was studying
recombinant DNA technology...

269
00:16:17,726 --> 00:16:19,811
...and I was confidant
I could create one...

270
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:24,732
...but my parents were unwilling to secure
the necessary eagle eggs and lion semen.

271
00:16:26,735 --> 00:16:29,988
Of course, my sister got swimming lessons
when she wanted them.

272
00:16:32,408 --> 00:16:37,745
Sheldon, not that we don't all enjoy
a good lion-semen story...

273
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:39,414
...but what's your point?

274
00:16:39,581 --> 00:16:45,044
My point is, if Koothrappali is moving on
to a new life of shallow, undeserved fame...

275
00:16:45,212 --> 00:16:48,840
...then perhaps this is an opportunity
to create a better cohort.

276
00:16:49,299 --> 00:16:52,010
You wanna breed a new friend?

277
00:16:52,928 --> 00:16:55,096
That's one option, but who has the time?

278
00:16:55,764 --> 00:16:57,056
But consider this.

279
00:16:57,224 --> 00:17:00,768
The Japanese, they're doing some
wonderful work with artificial intelligence.

280
00:17:00,936 --> 00:17:05,148
Now, combine that with some animatronics
from the imagineers over at Disney.

281
00:17:05,315 --> 00:17:09,944
Next thing you know, we're playing "Halo"
with a multilingual Abraham Lincoln.

282
00:17:10,612 --> 00:17:14,198
Sheldon, don't take this the wrong way,
but you're insane.

283
00:17:15,117 --> 00:17:19,203
That may well be, but the fact is it
wouldn't kill us to meet some new people.

284
00:17:19,371 --> 00:17:22,290
For the record,
it could kill us to meet new people.

285
00:17:23,917 --> 00:17:27,920
They could be murderers
or the carriers of unusual pathogens.

286
00:17:28,422 --> 00:17:31,883
And I'm not insane.
My mother had me tested.

287
00:17:35,304 --> 00:17:38,139
If we do get a new friend,
he should be a guy you can trust.

288
00:17:38,307 --> 00:17:40,141
You know, a guy who has your back.

289
00:17:40,309 --> 00:17:43,978
He should have money and live in a cool
place by the beach where we throw parties.

290
00:17:44,146 --> 00:17:48,316
- He should share our love of technology.
- And he should know a lot of women.

291
00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:51,694
Okay, let's see, money, women, technology.
Okay, we're agreed.

292
00:17:51,862 --> 00:17:55,490
Our new friend is going to be Iron Man.

293
00:17:58,494 --> 00:18:00,536
RAJESH [SINGING]:
I can go all night

294
00:18:00,704 --> 00:18:03,164
If you know what I mean

295
00:18:03,332 --> 00:18:06,084
Welcome to the Raj Mahal.

296
00:18:06,585 --> 00:18:08,336
Yes, it's very nice. Good night, Raj.

297
00:18:08,504 --> 00:18:10,505
- Wait, the evening's not over.
- Yes, it is.

298
00:18:10,672 --> 00:18:14,342
No, it's time to put on some R. Kelly
and suck face.

299
00:18:15,511 --> 00:18:17,178
Oh, wow, is the evening over.

300
00:18:17,346 --> 00:18:18,471
[COMPUTER BEEPS]

301
00:18:18,639 --> 00:18:21,182
Wait, wait, wait. That's my mommy
and daddy calling from India.

302
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:22,850
I want you to meet my parents.

303
00:18:23,018 --> 00:18:24,477
Wait, meet them?

304
00:18:27,481 --> 00:18:31,984
Hello, Mommy, Daddy. Good to see you.
How are you? I'm not drunk.

305
00:18:32,528 --> 00:18:35,488
- Why would you say that?
- Just making conversation.

306
00:18:35,656 --> 00:18:38,783
Mommy, Daddy, I want you to meet
my new squeeze, Penny.

307
00:18:38,951 --> 00:18:41,869
I am not your squeeze.
There is no squeezing.

308
00:18:42,037 --> 00:18:44,539
I can't see her. Center her in the frame.

309
00:18:44,706 --> 00:18:46,958
Here you go. Cute, huh?

310
00:18:47,709 --> 00:18:49,627
She's not Indian.

311
00:18:49,795 --> 00:18:52,255
So she's not Indian.
The boy's sowing some wild oats.

312
00:18:52,422 --> 00:18:55,842
No, no, no, there's no sowing,
no squeezing and no sucking face.

313
00:18:57,052 --> 00:18:58,469
What if he gets her pregnant?

314
00:18:58,637 --> 00:19:02,181
Is this hotsy-totsy who you want
as the mother of your grandchildren?

315
00:19:02,724 --> 00:19:05,393
What right do you have
to pick whom I can have children with?

316
00:19:05,561 --> 00:19:07,812
Look, Rajesh, I understand,
you're in America...

317
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:10,356
...you want to try the "local cuisine."

318
00:19:10,524 --> 00:19:14,485
But trust me,
you don't want it for a steady diet.

319
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:19,407
Now, you listen to me. I am no longer
a child and I will not be spoken to like one.

320
00:19:19,575 --> 00:19:22,577
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have to go throw up.

321
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:27,081
- What's wrong with him?
PENNY: I don't know.

322
00:19:27,249 --> 00:19:29,834
Maybe it's the local cuisine.

323
00:19:33,755 --> 00:19:37,758
Okay, well, it's nice to meet you.

324
00:19:37,926 --> 00:19:40,428
Just gonna set you on down over here.

325
00:19:40,929 --> 00:19:44,348
And I'm gonna leave, so namaste.

326
00:19:47,436 --> 00:19:50,771
And FYI, you'd be lucky
to have me as a daughter-in-law.

327
00:19:53,025 --> 00:19:54,775
