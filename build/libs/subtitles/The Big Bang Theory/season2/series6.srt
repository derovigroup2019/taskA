1
00:00:00,689 --> 00:00:03,466
So, if any of you are considering
going into experimental physics,

2
00:00:03,586 --> 00:00:05,300
my door is always open.

3
00:00:05,707 --> 00:00:08,345
Once again, I'm sorry
the demonstration didn't quite work out,

4
00:00:08,505 --> 00:00:10,894
but now we know what happens
when you accidentally spill

5
00:00:11,014 --> 00:00:13,277
Peach Snapple
into a helium neon laser.

6
00:00:15,868 --> 00:00:17,931
Short answer is... don't.

7
00:00:22,711 --> 00:00:25,372
And now to tell you
about the theoretical physics department

8
00:00:25,492 --> 00:00:26,905
is Dr. Sheldon Cooper.

9
00:00:32,319 --> 00:00:33,303
Forget it.

10
00:00:35,478 --> 00:00:36,509
Excuse me.

11
00:00:38,053 --> 00:00:40,668
- Sheldon, we both agreed to do this.
- It's a waste of time.

12
00:00:40,788 --> 00:00:42,790
I might as well explain
the laws of thermodynamics

13
00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:44,621
to a bunch of labradoodles.

14
00:00:46,459 --> 00:00:47,640
If you don't do this,

15
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:49,951
I won't take you
to the comic book store.

16
00:00:59,150 --> 00:01:01,213
Nice work with the laser,
by the way.

17
00:01:04,268 --> 00:01:06,648
Looking out
at your fresh young faces,

18
00:01:06,768 --> 00:01:10,208
I remember when I too was
deciding my academic future

19
00:01:10,328 --> 00:01:12,057
as a lowly graduate student.

20
00:01:13,287 --> 00:01:14,735
Of course, I was 14.

21
00:01:15,947 --> 00:01:18,509
And I'd already achieved more
than most of you could ever hope to,

22
00:01:18,629 --> 00:01:20,235
despite my 9:00 bedtime.

23
00:01:22,239 --> 00:01:25,095
Now, there may be one or two
of you in this room

24
00:01:25,215 --> 00:01:28,646
who has what it takes to succeed
in theoretical physics.

25
00:01:28,766 --> 00:01:30,267
It's more likely that you'll spend

26
00:01:30,387 --> 00:01:32,338
your scientific careers teaching
5th graders

27
00:01:32,458 --> 00:01:35,181
how to make papier mache
volcanoes with baking soda lava.

28
00:01:37,510 --> 00:01:39,519
- Good God.
- In short...

29
00:01:39,951 --> 00:01:42,312
any one who told you
that you would someday be able

30
00:01:42,432 --> 00:01:44,374
to make any significant
contribution to physics,

31
00:01:44,494 --> 00:01:47,315
played a cruel trick on you,
a cruel trick indeed.

32
00:01:50,370 --> 00:01:51,448
Any questions?

33
00:01:54,610 --> 00:01:55,800
Of course not.

34
00:01:58,002 --> 00:01:59,727
I weep for the future of science.

35
00:01:59,847 --> 00:02:02,709
Now if you'll excuse me,
the latest issue of <i>Batman</i> is out.

36
00:02:03,786 --> 00:02:04,848
Come, Leonard.

37
00:02:08,874 --> 00:02:11,195
Laser demonstration's looking
pretty good now, huh?

38
00:02:32,899 --> 00:02:34,669
Subtitles: sub-way.fr

39
00:02:36,933 --> 00:02:38,362
I love this time
of the year.

40
00:02:38,482 --> 00:02:41,019
The leaves are turning,
there's a bracing chill in the air.

41
00:02:41,444 --> 00:02:43,919
Plus there's a whole new crop
of female grad students

42
00:02:44,039 --> 00:02:46,097
about to put on just enough
winter weight

43
00:02:46,217 --> 00:02:47,901
to make them needy
and vulnerable.

44
00:02:50,533 --> 00:02:52,444
That's right, honey,
have another calzone.

45
00:02:52,564 --> 00:02:53,736
Daddy can wait.

46
00:02:56,577 --> 00:02:59,246
Isn't there a university policy
against dating graduate students?

47
00:02:59,435 --> 00:03:01,845
No, if you can talk to them,
you can ask them out.

48
00:03:01,965 --> 00:03:03,417
Damn, there's always a catch.

49
00:03:04,982 --> 00:03:06,523
- Hey, guys.
- Hey, Leslie.

50
00:03:06,872 --> 00:03:10,215
So, dumbass, I heard you made
a grad student throw up last night.

51
00:03:11,245 --> 00:03:13,573
The truth can indeed
be a finger down the throat

52
00:03:13,693 --> 00:03:15,661
of those unprepared to hear it.

53
00:03:16,792 --> 00:03:19,176
But why should I cater
to second-rate minds?

54
00:03:19,296 --> 00:03:21,845
Because first-rate minds
call you "dumbass"?

55
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:25,804
Oh, yeah? Well...

56
00:03:26,462 --> 00:03:27,950
you're a mean person.

57
00:03:29,867 --> 00:03:31,198
Excuse me, Dr. Cooper,

58
00:03:31,318 --> 00:03:33,655
I'm Ramona Nowitzki.
I was at your talk last night.

59
00:03:34,217 --> 00:03:35,782
I think you're just brilliant.

60
00:03:35,979 --> 00:03:37,922
That is the prevailing opinion.

61
00:03:38,962 --> 00:03:40,570
Now I'm gonna
throw up.

62
00:03:41,738 --> 00:03:43,999
Howard Wolowitz,
department of engineering,

63
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:46,107
co-designer of the
International Space Station's

64
00:03:46,227 --> 00:03:48,027
Liquid Waste Disposal System.

65
00:03:56,086 --> 00:03:58,054
I've read
everything you've published.

66
00:03:58,313 --> 00:04:01,545
I liked your paper on grand unification
using string-network condensates

67
00:04:01,665 --> 00:04:04,299
and was wondering how you determined
that 3-dimensional string-nets

68
00:04:04,419 --> 00:04:07,130
provided a unified picture of ferrnions
and gauge bosons?

69
00:04:07,954 --> 00:04:10,533
Amazing,
an intelligent labradoodle.

70
00:04:16,212 --> 00:04:18,139
The fact is I'm quite
close to a breakthrough

71
00:04:18,259 --> 00:04:21,036
in showing how neutrinos emerge
from a string-net condensate.

72
00:04:21,227 --> 00:04:24,206
My God, that would change the way
we view the entire physical universe.

73
00:04:24,831 --> 00:04:26,027
It's what I do.

74
00:04:27,433 --> 00:04:30,670
You know, the Pishkin-Wolowitz
Liquid Waste Disposal System

75
00:04:30,790 --> 00:04:32,877
is turning a few heads as well.

76
00:04:37,062 --> 00:04:38,406
Again, ew.

77
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:44,309
I'd love to hear more
about how you intend to add neutrinos.

78
00:04:44,806 --> 00:04:46,714
Could we get
a cup of coffee sometime?

79
00:04:46,834 --> 00:04:48,021
I don't drink coffee.

80
00:04:48,181 --> 00:04:50,148
I do. I love me a cup of joe.

81
00:04:51,119 --> 00:04:53,183
It doesn't have to be coffee.
How about dinner?

82
00:04:53,303 --> 00:04:54,611
- I do eat dinner.
- Great.

83
00:04:54,771 --> 00:04:57,880
- I know a terrific Italian place.
- I never eat in strange restaurants.

84
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,492
One runs the risk
of non-standard cutlery.

85
00:05:01,650 --> 00:05:02,658
Excuse me?

86
00:05:02,778 --> 00:05:05,446
Sheldon lives in fear
of the three-tined fork.

87
00:05:06,865 --> 00:05:08,425
Three tines is not a fork.

88
00:05:08,545 --> 00:05:10,092
Three tines is a trident.

89
00:05:10,212 --> 00:05:13,481
Forks are for eating,
tridents are for ruling the seven seas.

90
00:05:15,674 --> 00:05:17,545
What if I brought food
to your place?

91
00:05:17,665 --> 00:05:19,090
That would be acceptable.

92
00:05:19,210 --> 00:05:20,690
On Mondays, I eat Thai food.

93
00:05:20,810 --> 00:05:22,142
Mee krob and chicken sate

94
00:05:22,262 --> 00:05:24,391
with extra peanut sauce
from Siam Palace.

95
00:05:24,711 --> 00:05:25,711
You got it.

96
00:05:25,967 --> 00:05:27,561
I already have your address.

97
00:05:31,074 --> 00:05:32,390
What a nice girl.

98
00:05:33,824 --> 00:05:36,402
Do you have any idea
what just happened?

99
00:05:36,928 --> 00:05:39,521
Yes. Apparently I'm getting
a free dinner.

100
00:05:44,991 --> 00:05:48,225
Oh, yeah, no, this thing's
majorly out of order.

101
00:05:48,412 --> 00:05:50,280
- See? Sorry.
- That's okay.

102
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:51,831
Guess I'm taking the stairs.

103
00:05:51,951 --> 00:05:53,596
- Where you going?
- 4- A.

104
00:05:53,716 --> 00:05:56,379
- You here to see Leonard?
- No, Dr. Cooper.

105
00:05:57,208 --> 00:05:58,788
Dr. Sheldon Cooper?

106
00:06:00,491 --> 00:06:01,907
We're having dinner.

107
00:06:02,516 --> 00:06:03,832
Sheldon Cooper?

108
00:06:06,187 --> 00:06:07,410
Tall, thin,

109
00:06:07,530 --> 00:06:10,026
looks a little like
a giant praying mantis?

110
00:06:12,528 --> 00:06:14,016
He is cute, isn't he?

111
00:06:22,517 --> 00:06:24,380
- Hi, Leonard.
- Hey, Ramona. Come on in.

112
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:27,512
- Thanks. Where should I put this?
- The kitchen's fine.

113
00:06:28,281 --> 00:06:30,992
- Hey, what are you doing?
- I need to see this.

114
00:06:33,095 --> 00:06:35,207
The viewing area's right over there.

115
00:06:37,832 --> 00:06:40,803
Sheldon, your girl... date... person...
Ramona's here.

116
00:06:42,837 --> 00:06:44,691
- Hello.
- Sorry I'm late.

117
00:06:44,811 --> 00:06:47,526
I just got so caught up reading
the draft of your latest paper.

118
00:06:47,646 --> 00:06:50,779
Did you enjoy the humorous footnote
where I illustrate mirror-symmetry

119
00:06:50,899 --> 00:06:53,199
by likening it to the Flash
playing tennis with himself?

120
00:06:53,319 --> 00:06:54,335
So funny.

121
00:06:55,825 --> 00:06:58,371
But the idea that you might be able
to incorporate gravity,

122
00:06:58,491 --> 00:07:01,499
I have to tell you,
I found it physically exhilarating.

123
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:06,534
My hypotheses tend
to have that effect.

124
00:07:08,678 --> 00:07:10,863
I'm sorry I didn't bring enough
for your friends.

125
00:07:10,983 --> 00:07:13,130
I assumed we were going to be alone.

126
00:07:17,182 --> 00:07:18,781
No, we were just going.

127
00:07:18,901 --> 00:07:20,265
To watch, right?

128
00:07:22,398 --> 00:07:24,094
No, come on, now,
we're going out.

129
00:07:24,254 --> 00:07:25,874
Come on, we'll be quiet.

130
00:07:27,410 --> 00:07:28,410
Let's go.

131
00:07:30,014 --> 00:07:31,263
Okay, you two.

132
00:07:32,174 --> 00:07:33,302
Have a nice...

133
00:07:33,770 --> 00:07:35,134
whatever this is.

134
00:07:39,273 --> 00:07:41,728
Okay, you guys, look,
I know this is none of my business,

135
00:07:41,848 --> 00:07:43,644
but I just... I have to ask.

136
00:07:44,028 --> 00:07:45,657
What's Sheldon's deal?

137
00:07:49,353 --> 00:07:52,404
- What do you mean "deal"?
- You know, like what's his deal?

138
00:07:52,666 --> 00:07:55,064
Is it girls...? Guys...?
Sock puppets...?

139
00:07:56,523 --> 00:07:58,705
Honestly, we've been operating
under the assumption

140
00:07:58,825 --> 00:08:00,311
that he has no deal.

141
00:08:01,317 --> 00:08:02,841
Come on, everybody has a deal.

142
00:08:03,001 --> 00:08:03,964
Not Sheldon.

143
00:08:04,084 --> 00:08:06,172
Over the years,
we've formulated many theories

144
00:08:06,292 --> 00:08:08,125
about how he might reproduce.

145
00:08:09,591 --> 00:08:11,379
I'm an advocate of mitosis.

146
00:08:13,541 --> 00:08:14,541
I'm sorry?

147
00:08:14,929 --> 00:08:18,599
I believe one day Sheldon will eat
an enormous amount of Thai food

148
00:08:18,719 --> 00:08:20,471
and split into two Sheldons.

149
00:08:22,946 --> 00:08:26,455
On the other hand, I think Sheldon
might be the larval form of his species,

150
00:08:26,575 --> 00:08:28,957
and someday he'll spin a cocoon
and emerge two months later

151
00:08:29,077 --> 00:08:30,949
with moth wings and an exoskeleton.

152
00:08:32,628 --> 00:08:34,900
Okay, well, thanks
for the nightmares.

153
00:08:36,939 --> 00:08:39,002
Hey, do you want to
hang out with us?

154
00:08:39,739 --> 00:08:41,481
What are you guys gonna do?

155
00:08:43,643 --> 00:08:45,785
My mom's making a brisket tonight.

156
00:08:47,307 --> 00:08:49,240
The one with the little onions?

157
00:08:53,169 --> 00:08:54,657
Yeah, I'm busy, so...

158
00:08:56,275 --> 00:08:57,275
Good night.

159
00:08:58,630 --> 00:08:59,970
Her loss. Let's go.

160
00:09:01,405 --> 00:09:02,606
Brisket party!

161
00:09:02,726 --> 00:09:04,478
B- to-the-R-to-the-I-S-K...

162
00:09:06,136 --> 00:09:07,550
To-the-E-to-the-T...

163
00:09:09,677 --> 00:09:10,697
Don't.

164
00:09:14,777 --> 00:09:16,309
Aren't you having breakfast?

165
00:09:16,587 --> 00:09:17,587
Yes.

166
00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:22,482
Are you experimenting with
nutritional suppositories again?

167
00:09:24,497 --> 00:09:25,837
Not in these pants.

168
00:09:27,549 --> 00:09:30,031
So... how'd it go
with Ramona last night?

169
00:09:31,109 --> 00:09:33,845
Great.
She's smart, insightful

170
00:09:33,965 --> 00:09:37,023
and she has a very unique way
of, you know, revering me.

171
00:09:40,019 --> 00:09:42,310
Here's your spinach mushroom omelet.

172
00:09:43,293 --> 00:09:44,321
Thank you.

173
00:09:45,477 --> 00:09:48,112
- Did anyone touch it?
- Gloves were worn by everyone involved.

174
00:09:48,232 --> 00:09:49,467
I was vigilant.

175
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:53,578
Ramona pointed out
that I've been wasting 20 minutes a day

176
00:09:53,698 --> 00:09:56,267
- standing on cafeteria lines.
- Time which would be better spent

177
00:09:56,387 --> 00:09:58,423
tackling the great physics
problems of our day.

178
00:09:58,543 --> 00:10:01,688
You don't tackle the big issues.
You fence with them.

179
00:10:02,094 --> 00:10:03,386
En garde. Riposte.

180
00:10:08,468 --> 00:10:09,468
Touche.

181
00:10:11,255 --> 00:10:12,935
- Morning.
- Hey, Lesly.

182
00:10:13,194 --> 00:10:15,176
So I see you're organizing
your papers

183
00:10:15,296 --> 00:10:17,677
for the Smithsonian Museum
of Dumbassery.

184
00:10:19,566 --> 00:10:21,312
There won't be any room
until they get rid

185
00:10:21,432 --> 00:10:23,414
of the permanent Leslie Winkle exhibit.

186
00:10:25,497 --> 00:10:26,497
Good one.

187
00:10:27,877 --> 00:10:30,317
I see you got a grad student
to fight your battles for you.

188
00:10:30,437 --> 00:10:32,389
I'll let you keep
your lunch money today.

189
00:10:33,638 --> 00:10:35,997
Dr. Cooper is on the verge
of a breakthrough.

190
00:10:36,117 --> 00:10:39,601
If you're going to stay,
you'll have to be respectful and quiet.

191
00:10:47,922 --> 00:10:48,934
Wait for me.

192
00:10:53,317 --> 00:10:55,033
Have you worked out
the neutrino issue?

193
00:10:55,660 --> 00:10:59,169
Well, to paraphrase Mozart,
all the subatomic particles are there.

194
00:10:59,289 --> 00:11:01,068
I just have to put them
in the right order.

195
00:11:01,188 --> 00:11:02,207
You're so witty.

196
00:11:03,176 --> 00:11:04,125
Aren't I?

197
00:11:09,245 --> 00:11:11,174
Hey, guys,
this package came for...

198
00:11:15,667 --> 00:11:17,115
Dr. Cooper is working.

199
00:11:17,235 --> 00:11:18,840
Yes, I'm close to a breakthrough.

200
00:11:19,336 --> 00:11:20,348
It tickles!

201
00:11:22,555 --> 00:11:23,555
Sorry.

202
00:11:28,446 --> 00:11:30,370
Holy crap on a cracker.

203
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:35,532
You probably don't want
to go in there.

204
00:11:35,913 --> 00:11:37,352
Why? What are they doing?

205
00:11:38,546 --> 00:11:42,121
The only way I could explain it would be
in a therapist's office with dolls.

206
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:52,880
Boy.

207
00:11:54,730 --> 00:11:56,136
Dr. Cooper's working.

208
00:11:56,495 --> 00:11:57,983
Yeah, I can see that.

209
00:11:58,921 --> 00:12:01,558
Sheldon, <i>Halo </i>night, Koothrappali's.
You coming?

210
00:12:01,719 --> 00:12:03,345
Yes, it's <i>Halo </i>night.

211
00:12:03,465 --> 00:12:05,127
Let me just dry my tootsies.

212
00:12:06,595 --> 00:12:09,268
- You're not going to <i>Halo </i>night.
- Yes, I am.

213
00:12:09,388 --> 00:12:11,450
It's Wednesday.
Wednesday's <i>Halo </i>night.

214
00:12:12,687 --> 00:12:15,809
Didn't a great man once say,
"Science demands nothing less

215
00:12:15,929 --> 00:12:17,952
"than the fervent and
unconditional dedication

216
00:12:18,072 --> 00:12:19,351
"of our entire lives"?

217
00:12:20,308 --> 00:12:22,787
- He did.
- And who was that great man?

218
00:12:23,687 --> 00:12:24,687
Me.

219
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,669
- Sorry, Leonard.
- Seriously? You're not coming?

220
00:12:29,829 --> 00:12:32,133
You heard her.
How can I argue with me?

221
00:12:34,226 --> 00:12:37,122
Okay, well, once again,
you guys have a good...

222
00:12:38,153 --> 00:12:39,443
whatever this is.

223
00:12:42,577 --> 00:12:45,977
Dr. Cooper, I have to tell you
your friends are holding you back.

224
00:12:46,346 --> 00:12:49,247
I prefer to think of it
as "I'm pulling them forward."

225
00:12:50,828 --> 00:12:51,816
<i>Halo</i> night?

226
00:12:51,936 --> 00:12:53,700
A man with your intellectual gifts

227
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:56,071
doesn't waste an evening
playing video games.

228
00:12:56,599 --> 00:12:58,087
He does on Wednesdays.

229
00:12:59,138 --> 00:13:00,892
Not if he wants a Nobel Prize.

230
00:13:01,648 --> 00:13:02,997
He does want that.

231
00:13:06,022 --> 00:13:08,800
Does a man with my intellectual gifts
play paintball on weekends?

232
00:13:09,831 --> 00:13:11,775
- What do you think?
- Drat.

233
00:13:14,228 --> 00:13:17,120
- Now shall we get back to work?
- I suppose.

234
00:13:21,087 --> 00:13:22,889
<i>Battlestar Galactica</i>
comes on tonight.

235
00:13:24,528 --> 00:13:25,934
I guess I can wait for the DVD.

236
00:13:27,859 --> 00:13:29,664
And then, never ever watch it.

237
00:14:32,871 --> 00:14:35,407
Sheldon, honey, I've told you,
it's a small apartment.

238
00:14:35,527 --> 00:14:37,088
You only have to knock one time.

239
00:14:37,248 --> 00:14:38,568
I don't have a lot of time.

240
00:14:38,688 --> 00:14:40,052
Ramona finally dozed off,

241
00:14:40,172 --> 00:14:42,194
and I need you to help me
get rid of her.

242
00:14:44,854 --> 00:14:46,361
Get rid of her how?

243
00:14:47,089 --> 00:14:48,141
I don't know,

244
00:14:48,301 --> 00:14:50,957
but apparently
I'm in some kind of relationship,

245
00:14:51,608 --> 00:14:54,105
and you seem to be an expert
at ending them.

246
00:14:58,232 --> 00:14:59,194
Excuse me?

247
00:14:59,562 --> 00:15:02,780
I see man after man
leaving this apartment never to return.

248
00:15:03,883 --> 00:15:06,652
Okay, first of all,
it is not man after man.

249
00:15:07,842 --> 00:15:08,842
Hide me.

250
00:15:10,528 --> 00:15:12,950
- Hide you?
- I formally request sanctuary.

251
00:15:15,015 --> 00:15:16,402
Why aren't you working?

252
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:19,839
She distracted me.

253
00:15:21,406 --> 00:15:23,826
I told you, Penny,
I don't have time for your nonsense.

254
00:15:23,946 --> 00:15:25,829
I have important things to do.

255
00:15:28,549 --> 00:15:29,549
Oh, man.

256
00:15:30,218 --> 00:15:32,099
- I know what's going on here.
- Really?

257
00:15:32,219 --> 00:15:33,822
Then will you explain it to me?

258
00:15:34,834 --> 00:15:36,731
You're in love with Dr. Cooper.

259
00:15:38,285 --> 00:15:39,852
Yeah, no, that's not it.

260
00:15:41,102 --> 00:15:42,550
Don't try to deny it.

261
00:15:42,967 --> 00:15:44,113
He's a remarkable man,

262
00:15:44,573 --> 00:15:46,458
but you have to let him go.

263
00:15:47,198 --> 00:15:48,428
Gee, okay.

264
00:15:49,905 --> 00:15:52,732
I know it's hard,
but he's a gift to the whole world,

265
00:15:52,852 --> 00:15:54,290
and we can't be selfish.

266
00:15:54,451 --> 00:15:56,002
Yeah, he's a gift all right.

267
00:15:58,283 --> 00:15:59,283
Sisters?

268
00:16:03,179 --> 00:16:04,032
Sure.

269
00:16:04,152 --> 00:16:05,152
Sisters.

270
00:16:10,283 --> 00:16:12,168
Holy crap on a cracker.

271
00:16:28,274 --> 00:16:29,682
What are you doing?!

272
00:16:30,039 --> 00:16:31,309
It's Morse code.

273
00:16:33,549 --> 00:16:34,539
Why?

274
00:16:34,699 --> 00:16:36,949
So we can communicate
through the wall.

275
00:16:38,294 --> 00:16:41,007
We are communicating
through the wall.

276
00:16:41,448 --> 00:16:44,007
Yes, but the communication
is not encrypted.

277
00:16:45,274 --> 00:16:47,013
I don't know Morse code.

278
00:16:47,211 --> 00:16:49,010
It's very simple. This is A...

279
00:16:49,605 --> 00:16:50,657
This is B...

280
00:16:51,549 --> 00:16:53,553
- This is C.
- I'm not going to learn Morse code

281
00:16:53,673 --> 00:16:55,000
at 3:00 in the morning!

282
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:56,120
All right.

283
00:16:57,807 --> 00:17:00,064
Don't come in here,
don't come in here...

284
00:17:05,387 --> 00:17:06,512
What's going on?

285
00:17:06,632 --> 00:17:08,448
Ramona's sleeping on the couch.

286
00:17:08,608 --> 00:17:10,408
I know.
When is she going home?

287
00:17:10,569 --> 00:17:12,174
Never. That's the problem.

288
00:17:13,243 --> 00:17:15,872
- I need your help.
- What are you talking about?

289
00:17:16,223 --> 00:17:19,436
I'm invoking the Skynet clause
of our friendship agreement.

290
00:17:20,078 --> 00:17:21,633
That only applies if you need me

291
00:17:21,753 --> 00:17:23,973
to help you destroy
an artificial intelligence

292
00:17:24,093 --> 00:17:26,466
you've created that's taking
over the Earth.

293
00:17:26,627 --> 00:17:28,174
Come on! Don't nitpick!

294
00:17:30,114 --> 00:17:31,114
Good night.

295
00:17:31,661 --> 00:17:32,661
All right.

296
00:17:34,227 --> 00:17:36,408
I'm invoking
our Body Snatchers clause.

297
00:17:37,499 --> 00:17:40,153
The Body Snatchers clause requires me
to help you destroy

298
00:17:40,273 --> 00:17:42,867
someone we know
who's been replaced with an alien pod.

299
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:45,337
She's in the living room.
Go. I'll wait here.

300
00:17:46,368 --> 00:17:48,279
Sheldon,
what are you doing out of bed?

301
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:49,612
Now! Do it!

302
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:55,804
You know you need your sleep
in order for your cognitive processing

303
00:17:55,924 --> 00:17:57,866
to perform at optimum levels.
Now come on.

304
00:17:57,986 --> 00:17:59,215
Godzilla clause?

305
00:18:00,086 --> 00:18:01,970
Not unless she destroys Tokyo.

306
00:18:03,204 --> 00:18:04,204
Rats.

307
00:18:06,290 --> 00:18:07,390
I've got it!

308
00:18:07,907 --> 00:18:10,551
I finally reconciled
the black hole information paradox

309
00:18:10,711 --> 00:18:12,887
with my theory
of string-network condensates!

310
00:18:13,593 --> 00:18:16,307
It's unbelievable!
It's paradigm-altering.

311
00:18:16,467 --> 00:18:18,142
I could not have done it
without you.

312
00:18:18,303 --> 00:18:20,311
Please, I just offered
a little encouragement.

313
00:18:20,674 --> 00:18:22,021
It was a lot more than that.

314
00:18:22,141 --> 00:18:24,402
You helped me work out
the masses of all the fermions

315
00:18:24,522 --> 00:18:26,150
and you pumiced my hammer toe.

316
00:18:28,104 --> 00:18:29,487
How can I ever repay you?

317
00:18:30,334 --> 00:18:33,050
Would you consider naming it
the Cooper-Nowitzki Theorem?

318
00:18:33,234 --> 00:18:34,400
Who's Nowitzki?

319
00:18:36,613 --> 00:18:37,578
I'm Nowitzki.

320
00:18:38,439 --> 00:18:39,914
You want me to share credit?

321
00:18:41,907 --> 00:18:42,907
Get out!

322
00:18:46,707 --> 00:18:47,707
Bite me!

323
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:51,600
Sisters?

324
00:18:55,835 --> 00:18:57,640
Excuse me, Dr. Cooper.

325
00:18:58,037 --> 00:19:00,793
I'm Kathy O'Brien.
I just finished reading your paper

326
00:19:00,913 --> 00:19:03,075
reconciling the black hole
information paradox

327
00:19:03,195 --> 00:19:05,329
with your theory
of string-network condensates,

328
00:19:05,449 --> 00:19:07,108
and it just took my breath away.

329
00:19:08,733 --> 00:19:11,470
Maybe when I publish it,
I'll include an inhaler.

330
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:17,910
Would you possibly have any time
for me to pick your brain?

331
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:20,219
Let's see. Today's Thursday.

332
00:19:20,339 --> 00:19:22,188
Thursday nights, I eat pizza
from Giacomo's.

333
00:19:22,308 --> 00:19:23,916
Sausage, mushrooms, light olives.

334
00:19:24,254 --> 00:19:26,079
Great.
I'll bring it to your place.

335
00:19:26,199 --> 00:19:27,503
I have the address.

336
00:19:31,251 --> 00:19:32,550
What a nice girl.

337
00:19:34,802 --> 00:19:36,888
Sheldon, do you see
what just happened here?

338
00:19:37,429 --> 00:19:39,413
Yes, I'm getting a free pizza.

339
00:19:42,636 --> 00:19:43,806
I'm on a roll.

340
00:19:49,165 --> 00:19:50,736
More pad Thai, please.

341
00:19:51,157 --> 00:19:53,071
Sheldon, you've already had
four servings.

342
00:19:53,231 --> 00:19:54,940
You might want
to slow down a bit.

343
00:19:56,241 --> 00:19:57,927
Just one more bite.

344
00:20:07,329 --> 00:20:08,462
Are you okay?

345
00:20:08,916 --> 00:20:10,067
I'm just so...

346
00:20:10,484 --> 00:20:11,484
full.

347
00:20:23,106 --> 00:20:24,792
That's it. No more Thai food.
