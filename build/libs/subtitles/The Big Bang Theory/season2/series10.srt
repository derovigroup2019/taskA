1
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:06,690
I don't see anything at all,Sheldon.

2
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:11,420
Well,you're the doctor, but I am
constantly hearing this annoying sound.

3
00:00:11,870 --> 00:00:14,280
Me,too.

4
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:16,120
Is it a high-frequency whistle?

5
00:00:16,130 --> 00:00:20,330
No,it's more of a relentless,
narcissistic drone.

6
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:23,990
Yup,there's no
inflammation at all,Sheldon.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,720
Then it must be a tumor.

8
00:00:27,550 --> 00:00:29,390
Seriously doubt it.

9
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:34,550
Maybe it's a lingering bacterial infection
from all those childhood toilet swirlies.

10
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:36,420
Is that possible?

11
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:38,900
I used to get those all the time.

12
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:41,460
Even in church.

13
00:00:41,470 --> 00:00:44,970
Well,if it is from a swirly,
there something I can do.

14
00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:50,730
Okay,circle, circle,dot,dot,
now you have a cootie shot!

15
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:55,580
- I'm going to bed.
- Okay,I'll be right in.

16
00:00:57,020 --> 00:01:01,590
It's not enough that she mocks me,but that isn't
even the correct procedure for a cootie shot.

17
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:06,340
Do you understand that Stephanie's not
here to treat your imaginary ailments?

18
00:01:06,350 --> 00:01:10,380
How is it imaginary that I keep
hearing an octave above Middle C?

19
00:01:12,070 --> 00:01:13,890
Is that imaginary?

20
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:17,540
I don't think so.

21
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:23,190
- Good night.
- Another thing.

22
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,350
Under Article One,Section
Three of our Roommate Agreement,

23
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:26,820
I'm calling an emergency meeting.

24
00:01:26,830 --> 00:01:27,850
No,you're not.

25
00:01:27,870 --> 00:01:30,190
Leonard moves the meeting
not occur. Is there a second?

26
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:32,960
None heard,the motion fails.

27
00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:38,770
I'd like to begin the meeting by congratulating you on
the progress in your relationship with Dr. Stephanie.

28
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:40,130
Thank you.

29
00:01:40,150 --> 00:01:44,640
That being said, we have to discuss the
implementation of the agreed upon "cohabitation" rider

30
00:01:44,650 --> 00:01:47,670
which has been activated now that
the two of you are living together.

31
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,180
We're not living together.

32
00:01:49,190 --> 00:01:51,340
I beg to disagree.

33
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:54,890
"A girlfriend shall be deemed
quote living with un-quote Leonard

34
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:57,200
when she has stayed over
for A:ten consecutive nights,

35
00:01:57,210 --> 00:01:59,670
or B: more than nine nights
in a three week period,

36
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:03,840
or C: all the weekends of a
given month plus three weeknights.

37
00:02:06,890 --> 00:02:08,920
That's absurd.

38
00:02:08,930 --> 00:02:12,130
You initialed it. See? L.H.,L.H.,L.H.

39
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:16,610
Wait,I only initialed it because
I never thought it would happen!

40
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:22,080
I initialed another clause naming you
my sidekick in case I get superpowers.

41
00:02:23,170 --> 00:02:25,000
Hmm,yes,you did.

42
00:02:25,010 --> 00:02:29,460
Now,to review,the following
provisions are hereby activated:

43
00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:33,350
In the refrigerator, as opposed to us having
two separate shelves and one communal shelf,

44
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:37,140
the three of us now get individual
shelves and the door becomes communal.

45
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:40,970
Next,apartment vacuuming shall be
increased from two to three times a week

46
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:43,920
to accommodate the increased
accumulation of dead skin cells.

47
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:45,610
Third,the bhroom schedule.

48
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:50,160
Now,I'm given to understand women have
different needs,so, we'll have to discuss that.

49
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:55,270
I'm going to bed.

50
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:57,160
At least take this with you.

51
00:02:57,170 --> 00:03:01,260
Look,and have Stephanie
initial here,here,here,here...

52
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:04,390
and... here.

53
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:09,770
This states that she does not now nor does she
intend to play a percussive or brass instrument.

54
00:03:25,450 --> 00:03:29,670
Sure sounds like a tumor
pressing on the auditory nerve.

58
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:55,500
No,absolutely not.

59
00:03:55,510 --> 00:03:58,900
It's not a big deal.
We have latex gloves.

60
00:03:59,450 --> 00:04:04,560
I don't care what the symptoms are, my girlfriend
is not going to give you a prostate exam.

61
00:04:06,410 --> 00:04:07,340
Hi,Sheldon.

62
00:04:07,350 --> 00:04:09,430
Good morning, Dr. Stephanie.

63
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:13,100
I ust Leonard satisfied
you sexually last night.

64
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:17,330
Sheldon,we don't ask
questions like that.

65
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:20,850
I heard you ask it over and over.

66
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:24,070
How is it inappropriate
for me to ask it once?

67
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,550
He did very nicely.

68
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:27,160
See? She's not offended.

69
00:04:27,170 --> 00:04:30,020
And now you finally have an answer.

70
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,150
Out of coffee. Need coffee.

71
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:35,550
Oh,hello.

72
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:37,810
Stephanie,right?

73
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:40,360
And-And-
And you are?

74
00:04:40,370 --> 00:04:42,530
Penny,I live across the hall.

75
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:44,320
I've heard a lot about you.

76
00:04:44,330 --> 00:04:45,690
Really?

77
00:04:45,710 --> 00:04:48,640
I haven't heard a thing about you.

78
00:04:56,220 --> 00:04:57,630
Leonard?

79
00:04:57,640 --> 00:05:01,070
Why haven't I heard a thing about
this woman who lives across the hall

80
00:05:01,090 --> 00:05:03,740
and comes into your
apartment in the morning...

81
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:06,950
in her underwear?

82
00:05:11,950 --> 00:05:15,520
She's heard about you because
we're,you know, involved

83
00:05:15,530 --> 00:05:18,990
and you haven't heard
about her because...

84
00:05:20,110 --> 00:05:23,130
I never slept with her,I swear!

85
00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:26,510
In Leonard's defense,it
wasn't for lack of trying.

86
00:05:28,150 --> 00:05:29,460
Thank you,Sheldon.

87
00:05:29,470 --> 00:05:31,660
You're welcome,Leonard.

88
00:05:31,670 --> 00:05:34,190
Look,I'm just saying,um...

89
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:39,010
Penny is one of our many neighbors,you
know, and in our building,

90
00:05:39,030 --> 00:05:43,450
neighbors come and go,it's
very casual,no dress code.

91
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:46,770
In fact,some mornings I'll just mosey
down to the third floor in my pajamas

92
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:49,470
and have cereal with Mrs.Vartabedian.

93
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:53,990
Really? I have never once been invited
to have cereal with Mrs. Vartabedian.

94
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,660
She doesn't like you.

95
00:05:56,670 --> 00:06:00,330
You have a gall bladder to remove
and I have to get in the shower

96
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:03,850
and Penny has clothes to put on,so...

97
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:05,500
Well,it was very nice meeting you.

98
00:06:05,530 --> 00:06:07,320
Nice to finally meet you,too.

99
00:06:07,330 --> 00:06:09,900
- And I'll see you
tonight? - Okay,bye-bye.

100
00:06:19,610 --> 00:06:23,260
What could I possibly have
done to offend Mrs. Vartabedian?

101
00:06:24,190 --> 00:06:28,040
So,that's Stephanie,huh?

102
00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:32,670
Why do I feel like I'm the one
that just got the prostate exam?

103
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:39,610
You know,she seems very nice.

104
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:41,320
Oh,she is. She's terrific.

105
00:06:41,330 --> 00:06:43,950
And she's proving to
be a valuable roommate.

106
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:46,160
Roommate? You guys are living together?

107
00:06:46,170 --> 00:06:48,400
Like hippies.

108
00:06:48,410 --> 00:06:49,980
We're not living together.

109
00:06:49,990 --> 00:06:52,880
Do I have to pull out
the paperwork again?

110
00:06:52,890 --> 00:06:54,430
We're not living together.

111
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:55,440
Are you sure?

112
00:06:55,450 --> 00:06:57,570
How could I not be sure?

113
00:06:57,580 --> 00:07:00,020
Well,let's find out.

114
00:07:00,030 --> 00:07:03,840
Don't you think if a woman was living with
me I'd be the first one to know about it?

115
00:07:03,850 --> 00:07:07,240
Oh,sweetie,you'd be the
last one to know about it.

116
00:07:10,270 --> 00:07:14,420
Hmm,cute dresses.

117
00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:17,230
I bet this looks great on you!

118
00:07:18,130 --> 00:07:19,920
We're not living together.

119
00:07:19,930 --> 00:07:21,510
Okay,hmm...

120
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:26,180
Scented candles, fuzzy
slippers, Floral bed sheets?

121
00:07:26,950 --> 00:07:28,430
We're not living together.

122
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:29,860
Okay,moving on.

123
00:07:29,870 --> 00:07:32,660
Now,who are these guys at Disney World?

124
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:36,090
Uh,the big dog is Goofy,

125
00:07:36,670 --> 00:07:41,060
but the older couple with
the mouse ears,I have no idea.

126
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:45,570
We're not living together!

127
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:48,210
You're going to go down swinging,huh?

128
00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:50,420
All right,well,we got your body lotion,

129
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:52,790
your InStyle Magazine,your jewelry box.

130
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,480
We're
not--

131
00:07:54,490 --> 00:07:57,440
Where's my Bat Signal?

132
00:07:57,450 --> 00:07:59,190
You have a Bat Signal?

133
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:01,390
I did.

134
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:04,110
It was right here.

135
00:08:04,130 --> 00:08:06,370
She
must've--

136
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:09,570
Oh,my God,we're living together.

137
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:13,280
Really? What was your first clue?

138
00:08:27,390 --> 00:08:29,280
New pants?

139
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:32,360
Yeah,Stephanie got them for me.

140
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:34,130
Nice. Cotton?

141
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:37,790
Actually,I think it's more
of a wool,fire ant blend.

142
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:40,710
So,the girlfriend's
buying clothes for you,huh?

143
00:08:40,730 --> 00:08:43,300
- Sounds serious.
- It is actually.

144
00:08:43,310 --> 00:08:49,660
In fact,I gave it a lot of thought and I
decided it was time for us to live together.

145
00:08:50,650 --> 00:08:53,120
Oh,Leonard,huge mistake.

146
00:08:53,130 --> 00:08:57,150
There's a whole buffet of women out there
and you're just standing in the corner

147
00:08:57,160 --> 00:09:01,170
eating the same deviled
egg over and over again.

148
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:04,670
At least I have an
egg. What do you have?

149
00:09:05,010 --> 00:09:09,440
A veritable smorgasbord of
potential sexual partners.

150
00:09:09,450 --> 00:09:12,350
See the blonde over there?

151
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:16,300
I can hit on her and you can't.

152
00:09:16,630 --> 00:09:19,930
So,go hit on her.

153
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,870
She's not my type.

154
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:27,900
Too bad,'cause she was
checking you out before.

155
00:09:27,910 --> 00:09:30,650
- She was?
- Of course not. Look at her.

156
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:34,580
I don't care what you guys think.

157
00:09:34,590 --> 00:09:37,410
Stephanie and I are very
happy living together.

158
00:09:37,430 --> 00:09:41,530
I will give either of you 20
dollars,right now to trade pants with me.

159
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:49,820
Sheldon,what are you doing here?

160
00:09:49,830 --> 00:09:51,790
Hang on.

161
00:09:52,070 --> 00:09:54,620
130 over 80.

162
00:09:54,630 --> 00:09:56,040
A little high.

163
00:09:56,060 --> 00:10:00,090
We can attribute that to the stress
of sneaking past the security desk.

164
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:02,810
Where did you get the stethoscope
and the blood pressure cuff?

165
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:06,970
My aunt Marion gave them
to me for my 12th birthday.

166
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:11,910
She thought if I failed at theoretical physics
that I should have a trade to fall back on.

167
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:17,150
And by the way,the blood pressure
cuff is called a sphygmomanometer.

168
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:17,790
I know.

169
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:20,900
Didn't they teach you
that in medical school?

170
00:10:21,610 --> 00:10:23,440
- I'm busy here,Sheldon.
- I understand.

171
00:10:23,450 --> 00:10:26,880
All I need is for you
to authorize these tests.

172
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:32,260
A cardiac stress test,a full body MRI,an
electromyogram,a CBC,baseline glucose.

173
00:10:32,270 --> 00:10:33,270
Upper GI?

174
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:35,320
Oh,and an exploratory laparoscopy.

175
00:10:35,330 --> 00:10:40,140
Last time I had hiccups,it felt like my
diaphragm was just going through the motions.

176
00:10:40,430 --> 00:10:42,380
Go home,Sheldon.

177
00:10:42,390 --> 00:10:45,000
Can I at least have the upper GI?

178
00:10:45,010 --> 00:10:47,620
I already drank the barium!

179
00:10:51,020 --> 00:10:53,060
Oh,good. Do you have
any fabric softener?

180
00:10:53,070 --> 00:10:55,210
Yeah,sure.

181
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:06,790
What are you washing? A crocodile?

182
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:09,970
No,the pants that Stephanie got me.

183
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:13,420
Oh,sweetie,you can't machine
wash these. They'll be ruined.

184
00:11:13,430 --> 00:11:16,240
- Are you sure?
- Absolutely.

185
00:11:19,060 --> 00:11:22,010
Oh,no. I wish you'd told me that sooner.

186
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:26,170
Are you guys having problems?

187
00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:27,780
No,everything's fine.

188
00:11:27,790 --> 00:11:29,020
Really?

189
00:11:29,030 --> 00:11:32,060
Yeah,it's wonderful.

190
00:11:32,070 --> 00:11:38,200
Okay,maybe this whole living together happened
kind of suddenly,but it's fine,it's great.

191
00:11:38,210 --> 00:11:41,660
Okay,Leonard,honey,you know,if you're
uncomfortable with the way things are going,

192
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:43,860
you're allowed to say something.

193
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:46,490
Are you sure? That doesn't sound right.

194
00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:50,510
Believe me,your feelings are
just as important as hers.

195
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:54,110
No,that doesn't sound right either.

196
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:59,820
Just tell her you need the relationship to move
at a pace that you both are comfortable with.

197
00:12:00,150 --> 00:12:03,600
Yeah,I could say
something like that to her.

198
00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:05,390
I'll go do that.

199
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:08,500
- Thank you.
- Sure.

200
00:12:12,930 --> 00:12:15,760
You ve a really good grasp on this.

201
00:12:15,770 --> 00:12:18,590
Maybe you could talk to her?

202
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:21,360
You're kidding,right?

203
00:12:21,370 --> 00:12:24,340
No,but that's okay.

204
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:28,980
I'll go talk to her.

205
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:32,290
Want to come with?

206
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:35,280
Go!

207
00:12:45,310 --> 00:12:48,130
- Oh,no.
- Whaa?

208
00:12:48,830 --> 00:12:51,880
You were right. ur larynx
is terribly inflamed.

209
00:12:51,890 --> 00:12:53,870
I mean,I've never seen anything like it.

210
00:12:53,890 --> 00:12:56,750
I knew it!

211
00:12:57,330 --> 00:13:00,150
What do I do?

212
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:03,880
You're going to need to
stop talking immediately.

213
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:06,770
- For how--
- Dut-dut-dut.

214
00:13:07,970 --> 00:13:10,620
Immediately.

215
00:13:12,350 --> 00:13:15,060
- Oh,hi,honey.
- Sheldon.

216
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:24,250
What's going on?

217
00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:27,700
I just performed a "Sheldonectomy."

218
00:13:28,510 --> 00:13:31,800
Careful,if you don't get it
all,it'll only come back woe.

219
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:34,110
Gotcha.

220
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:36,510
Listen,we need to talk.

221
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:40,720
Do we need to talk or
"do we need to talk"?

222
00:13:40,730 --> 00:13:43,030
I don't know what that means.

223
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:46,500
Okay,why don't you just tell me
what it is you have to tell me?

224
00:13:46,510 --> 00:13:50,890
Okay,um,well,look,it's just that...

225
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:55,240
things between you and me
have been going pretty quick.

226
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:57,030
And...

227
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:58,820
It's just a little scary.

228
00:13:58,830 --> 00:14:01,790
Well,yeah,but scary good,right?

229
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:04,430
Sure...

230
00:14:04,850 --> 00:14:08,020
When is scary not good?

231
00:14:08,490 --> 00:14:09,970
But...

232
00:14:09,990 --> 00:14:13,170
okay,um,I have feelings,right?

233
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:16,580
Okay,and it's perfectly okay
to express those feelings,right?

234
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:19,280
Of course,honey,why don't you
tell me what it is you're feeling?

235
00:14:19,290 --> 00:14:24,580
Okay,we,I ju...I think it's important
to remember that we move at a pace

236
00:14:24,590 --> 00:14:28,470
that is our
speed and--

237
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:32,040
Oh,shoot,I had it!

238
00:14:32,050 --> 00:14:35,950
Okay,how about this? How about
I tell you what I'm feeling?

239
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:38,360
What's that?

240
00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:43,080
Really? Right now?

241
00:14:43,090 --> 00:14:44,420
Why not?

242
00:14:44,430 --> 00:14:47,700
I just ate,aren't you
supposed to wait an hour?

243
00:14:50,170 --> 00:14:52,260
I think that's for swimming.

244
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:55,180
Oh,okay.

245
00:14:55,860 --> 00:14:58,650
I just hope I don't get cramps.

246
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:04,290
- Oh,I put your clothes in the dryer.
- Thank you.

247
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:06,740
- Your pants are ruined.
- Good.

248
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:11,060
So,how did the talk with Stephanie go?

249
00:15:11,070 --> 00:15:16,150
Well,um,on one level,really,really well.

250
00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:19,790
So,you told her you
wanted to slow things down?

251
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:24,120
Not specifically,but,uh,I did
tell her that I had feelings.

252
00:15:24,130 --> 00:15:26,470
Good,good.

253
00:15:26,490 --> 00:15:29,000
And then what?

254
00:15:29,010 --> 00:15:33,310
And then,uh,the subject
got changed somehow.

255
00:15:34,330 --> 00:15:37,300
You had sex,didn't you?

256
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:40,670
little bit.

257
00:15:42,890 --> 00:15:45,930
- What?
- Nothing.

258
00:15:49,650 --> 00:15:52,470
Okay,well,it sounds like
things are going to work out.

259
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:56,020
Yeah,it's all good.
Everything's going to work out.

260
00:15:56,030 --> 00:15:58,120
One way or another.

261
00:15:58,130 --> 00:16:03,890
God,come on,Leonard,You are entitled to try
and make things go the way you want them to.

262
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:05,500
- Really?
- Yes!

263
00:16:05,510 --> 00:16:08,960
You don't always have to go
along with what the woman wants.

264
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:13,320
- What?
- Nothing. Just...

265
00:16:13,330 --> 00:16:16,450
rethinking my whole life.

266
00:16:20,610 --> 00:16:23,670
Okay,here's the thing.

267
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:27,720
I'm afraid that if I ask her
to move out,she'll just dump me.

268
00:16:27,730 --> 00:16:30,070
Well,it's a chance you have to take.

269
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:33,530
I mean,look,if it's
meant to be,it'll be.

270
00:16:33,850 --> 00:16:36,550
Very comforting.

271
00:16:37,170 --> 00:16:40,930
Okay,so what do I say to her?

272
00:16:40,940 --> 00:16:41,800
I don't know.

273
00:16:41,810 --> 00:16:45,750
I mean,what have women said to you when
they wanted to slow a relationship down?

274
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:49,390
I really like you,but I want
to see how things go with Mark?

275
00:16:52,110 --> 00:16:55,410
Yeah,that'll slow it down.

276
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:05,160
I'm sorry,I totally inteupted
you. What we you sang?

277
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:09,490
Oh,right,yeah,um.

278
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:13,690
So,Stephanie,hereththing.

279
00:17:14,020 --> 00:17:15,410
I really like yo

280
00:17:15,420 --> 00:17:18,950
Oh,God,here comes the speech.

281
00:17:22,170 --> 00:17:24,530
What speech?

282
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:29,380
"I really like you but maybe we sh
spend a little less time together"

283
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:33,030
"'cause I need mspace but
I'll call you on Tuesday

284
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:35,260
and then you never
call me so I call you,"

285
00:17:35,270 --> 00:17:39,020
but you don't call me back and then
when I run into you at the coffee shop,

286
00:17:39,030 --> 00:17:41,510
you pretend like you've been
having problems with your voice mail

287
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:42,870
and I know that you're lying,

288
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:47,760
but I pretend like I don't care
even though I'm dying inside!

289
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:55,650
No!

290
00:17:55,660 --> 00:17:57,350
No,no!

291
00:17:57,370 --> 00:17:59,320
I wasn't going to say any of that.

292
00:17:59,330 --> 00:18:02,330
I was just going to say...

293
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:05,400
I really like you.

294
00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:08,930
Oh,good!

295
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:12,530
'Cause I really like you,too.

296
00:18:15,450 --> 00:18:18,000
Terrific.

297
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:30,010
Nice sweater.

298
00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:33,550
Yeah,Stephanie got it
for me. It's kind of fun.

299
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:36,810
It's got a big bird on it,dude.

300
00:18:37,370 --> 00:18:40,590
Yeah,yeah,that's the fun part.

301
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:43,700
We're also getting new curtains
for my bedroom,and a dust ruffle,

302
00:18:43,730 --> 00:18:46,270
and a duvet,and I don't
even know what a duvet is,

303
00:18:46,290 --> 00:18:48,190
but I'm pretty sure if I
did I wouldn't want one,

304
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:50,680
but every time I talk
to her about moving out,

305
00:18:50,690 --> 00:18:53,350
she cries and we have sex.

306
00:18:54,060 --> 00:18:57,500
You're lucky. With me,it's
usually the other way around.

307
00:18:58,850 --> 00:19:02,090
You know,if you can't talk to
her,why don't you just text her?

308
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:03,630
Isn't that kind of cowardly?

309
00:19:03,650 --> 00:19:06,140
Oh,yeah. It's beyond contemptible.

310
00:19:06,490 --> 00:19:10,150
It's true,but on the other hand
you are wearing a bird sweater.

311
00:19:14,370 --> 00:19:16,340
Sold.

312
00:19:18,420 --> 00:19:24,590
"I think it would be better for our
relationship if you moved back to your place."

313
00:19:26,150 --> 00:19:29,930
There. It's done.

314
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:31,420
Good for you.

315
00:19:31,430 --> 00:19:34,630
Yeah,good for me.

316
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:37,880
I'll never have sex again.

317
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:44,340
Hmm,I was wrong. See ya.

318
00:19:50,490 --> 00:19:52,220
Penny.

319
00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:54,850
Penny.

320
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:57,940
Penny.

321
00:20:02,410 --> 00:20:04,630
Sheldon?

322
00:20:06,210 --> 00:20:10,320
I have an inflamed larynx.

323
00:20:12,310 --> 00:20:14,330
Okay?

324
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:21,550
We're out of herbal
tea. Do you have any?

325
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:27,820
Okay,let me check.

326
00:20:29,810 --> 00:20:34,560
Some hiney would be nice,too.

327
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:37,370
Hiney?

328
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:41,530
Honey.
