1
00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:02,380
Penny, hello.

2
00:00:03,190 --> 00:00:03,940
Hey, sheldon.

3
00:00:04,270 --> 00:00:05,700
What is shaking?

4
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:10,040
I'm sorry?

5
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:13,610
It's colloquial, a conversation opener.

6
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:16,090
So, do you find the weather satisfying?

7
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:18,220
Are you currently sharing in the triumph

8
00:00:18,220 --> 00:00:19,730
of some local sports team?

9
00:00:21,410 --> 00:00:23,360
What's wrong with you? you're freaking me out.

10
00:00:24,370 --> 00:00:26,720
I'm striking up a casual conversation with you.

11
00:00:27,470 --> 00:00:28,280
S'up?

12
00:00:33,810 --> 00:00:35,030
Please don't do that.

13
00:00:36,070 --> 00:00:36,420
All right,

14
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:37,741
But I'm given to understand that

15
00:00:37,741 --> 00:00:39,063
when you have something awkward to discuss with someone,

16
00:00:39,063 --> 00:00:42,140
it's more palatable to preface it with banal chit chat.

17
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:46,240
So, this wasn't the awkward part?

18
00:00:48,350 --> 00:00:49,700
No.

19
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:54,420
Oh, all right.

20
00:00:55,030 --> 00:00:55,970
S'up?

21
00:00:58,260 --> 00:00:59,760
Oh, good, I used that right.

22
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:01,414
Anyway,

23
00:01:01,414 --> 00:01:03,977
You're aware that leonard has entered into a new

24
00:01:03,977 --> 00:01:07,020
Romantic relationship which includes a sexual component?

25
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:12,540
Okay, feeling the awkward now.

26
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:15,107
Her name is

27
00:01:15,107 --> 00:01:16,962
dr.Stephanie barnett and she is a highly

28
00:01:16,962 --> 00:01:19,670
Distinguished surgical resident at freemont memorial.

29
00:01:19,670 --> 00:01:21,090
Yeah, leonard told me. good.

30
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:22,880
What he may have left out is

31
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:24,670
how important this relationship is to me.

32
00:01:26,990 --> 00:01:28,230
To you?

33
00:01:28,230 --> 00:01:31,257
Yes, see, of the handful of women leonard's been involved with,

34
00:01:31,257 --> 00:01:33,650
She's the only one I have ever found tolerable.

35
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:40,790
Well, what about me?

36
00:01:41,890 --> 00:01:43,670
The statement stands for itself.

37
00:01:46,450 --> 00:01:47,470
Well, aren't you sweet?

38
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:50,276
Anyway, should you have any interaction with her,

39
00:01:50,276 --> 00:01:53,750
It would be most helpful that she not see you as a sexual rival.

40
00:01:56,150 --> 00:01:57,830
Yeah, I think she's pretty safe.

41
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:00,801
You say that now, but consider the following senario

42
00:02:00,801 --> 00:02:02,963
you're sitting in your apartment,

43
00:02:02,963 --> 00:02:04,640
It's late, you're alone.

44
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:08,294
Your hypothalamus is swimming in a soup of estrogen and

45
00:02:08,294 --> 00:02:10,313
Progesterone and suddenly even

46
00:02:10,313 --> 00:02:13,410
Leonard seems like a viable sexual candidate.

47
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:17,160
Or a, uh, "hookup"

48
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:19,170
As it's referred to by today's urban youth.

49
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,370
Really? yes.

50
00:02:21,370 --> 00:02:22,565
Now, should that happen,

51
00:02:22,565 --> 00:02:25,630
I would ask you to find some way to suppress your libido.

52
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,920
I could think about you.

53
00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:35,810
Fine, whatever works.

54
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:39,550
Always nice talking to you, sheldon.

55
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:41,510
Uh, peace out!

56
00:03:17,350 --> 00:03:19,570
Well, this is very pleasant.

57
00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:23,300
Glad you're enjoying yourself.

58
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:26,050
And you said there'd never be enough pasta for the three of us.

59
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:28,800
I stand corrected.

60
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:31,640
You know, italian housewives have a rule of thumb.

61
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:34,647
A handful of dry pasta about an inch in diameter is

62
00:03:34,647 --> 00:03:38,420
Sufficient for each person as it doubles in volume when cooked.

63
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:41,000
That's very interesting.

64
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:41,670
Thank you.

65
00:03:41,670 --> 00:03:43,590
She doesn't mean it. she's just being nice.

66
00:03:45,990 --> 00:03:46,839
Well, stephanie,

67
00:03:46,839 --> 00:03:50,188
Since leonard seems to be dropping the conversational ball,

68
00:03:50,188 --> 00:03:52,440
I guess I'll just have to pick it up.

69
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:02,420
Have you ever witnessed a violent crime?

70
00:04:05,450 --> 00:04:07,140
No. good.

71
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:08,850
What's your favorite fruit?

72
00:04:08,850 --> 00:04:11,620
Uh, strawberries.

73
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:13,750
Hmm, technically not a fruit, but all right.

74
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:18,120
Where did you do your medical internship?

75
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:20,440
Uh, lawrence memorial in galveston, texas.

76
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:22,650
Really? that's where I was born!

77
00:04:25,190 --> 00:04:26,420
You're kidding!

78
00:04:26,420 --> 00:04:28,990
I spent so much of my childhood at that hospital.

79
00:04:28,990 --> 00:04:32,150
When I was 12, I got to ride there in a helicopter.

80
00:04:33,330 --> 00:04:34,590
Why, w-w-what happened?

81
00:04:34,590 --> 00:04:35,800
Radiation burns.

82
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:39,430
A little mishap while I was building my own cat scanner.

83
00:04:40,450 --> 00:04:43,260
I'm sorry, you tried to build your own cat scanner?

84
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:44,930
No, I didn't try, I succeeded.

85
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:47,190
In fact, I was briefly able to see

86
00:04:47,190 --> 00:04:48,631
the inside of my sister's guinea pig,

87
00:04:48,631 --> 00:04:50,010
Snowball, before he caught fire.

88
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,305
It led to an interesting

89
00:04:54,305 --> 00:04:56,450
"not a snowball's chance in a cat scanner."

90
00:04:58,930 --> 00:05:00,200
Uh, sheldon?

91
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:02,800
Excuse me.

92
00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:05,290
When I come back,just for fun,

93
00:05:05,290 --> 00:05:07,030
the subject will be alternative history.

94
00:05:07,030 --> 00:05:07,638
Specifically,

95
00:05:07,638 --> 00:05:09,965
How would the civil war have gone differently

96
00:05:09,965 --> 00:05:12,550
If lincoln had been a robot sent from the future?

97
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:19,740
Look at that, there's even pasta left over.

98
00:05:20,970 --> 00:05:24,210
Do you understand that this was supposed to be a date?

99
00:05:24,210 --> 00:05:24,459
I do.

100
00:05:24,459 --> 00:05:26,664
Do you? because frankly,

101
00:05:26,664 --> 00:05:28,870
you've been in a foul mood since I sat down.

102
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:36,360
Okay, here's my question. why did you sit down?

103
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:38,630
To help.

104
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:40,759
Look, if you fail at this relationship,

105
00:05:40,759 --> 00:05:42,888
and history suggests you will,

106
00:05:42,888 --> 00:05:45,354
Then we risk losing the medical officer

107
00:05:45,354 --> 00:05:48,010
That our landing party has always needed.

108
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:53,340
What landing party?

109
00:05:54,650 --> 00:05:56,727
You're kirk, I'm spock, wolowitz is scotty,

110
00:05:56,727 --> 00:05:59,250
Koothrappali is the guy who always gets killed...

111
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:04,020
And now we've got mccoy.

112
00:06:12,150 --> 00:06:12,255
So,

113
00:06:12,255 --> 00:06:14,117
We're all standing around looking at the post-op x ray

114
00:06:14,117 --> 00:06:15,980
and there it is,

115
00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:18,640
Clear as day, right in the guy's chest cavity...

116
00:06:19,090 --> 00:06:20,540
One of my earrings.

117
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:24,540
Oh, my god, what did you do?

118
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:26,640
What do you think I did?

119
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:28,456
I discreetly slipped off the other earring,

120
00:06:28,456 --> 00:06:30,920
Put it in my pocket and then got the hell out of there!

121
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:34,870
I have a bone to pick with you, sir.

122
00:06:36,670 --> 00:06:37,470
Hi, sheldon.

123
00:06:37,470 --> 00:06:38,134
Hi, stephanie.

124
00:06:38,134 --> 00:06:39,077
I'm sorry I'm late,

125
00:06:39,077 --> 00:06:42,170
But yourompanion left the most indecipherable invitation.

126
00:06:43,310 --> 00:06:44,790
What invitation?

127
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:48,150
"we're going to the movies."

128
00:06:48,610 --> 00:06:50,970
What movie? what theater? what time?

129
00:06:52,970 --> 00:06:55,101
If you were trying to make it impossible to locate you,

130
00:06:55,101 --> 00:06:56,600
You couldn't have done a better job.

131
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:58,730
Oh, clearly I could have.

132
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:02,915
It took me nearly 20 minutes to go through the browser

133
00:07:02,915 --> 00:07:05,470
History on your computer to see what movie times you looked up.

134
00:07:06,970 --> 00:07:08,480
Wait here, I'll find us seats.

135
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:09,800
Uh, no, we have seats.

136
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:11,360
Not the right seats.

137
00:07:22,450 --> 00:07:23,620
What is he doing?

138
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:26,240
He's finding the acoustic sweet spot.

139
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:31,950
Does he always do this?

140
00:07:31,950 --> 00:07:34,960
Sometimes he brings a toy xylophone.

141
00:07:42,150 --> 00:07:44,440
I am really sorry about this.

142
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:46,940
No, it's fine. you know, he's sweet.

143
00:07:54,770 --> 00:07:57,070
My apologies, you've been sitting in it all along.

144
00:07:57,990 --> 00:07:59,380
Leonard, you want to slide over one?

145
00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:01,600
No, just sit here.

146
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:18,570
Oh, yeah, this is it.

147
00:08:21,530 --> 00:08:22,580
Leonard.

148
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:25,120
Leonard? leonard?!

149
00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:26,810
What, sheldon?

150
00:08:26,810 --> 00:08:28,880
What, sheldon?! what, sheldon?!

151
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:31,510
Tell me what you see here.

152
00:08:31,510 --> 00:08:34,670
The blunt instrument that will be the focus of my murder trial?

153
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:37,800
This is stephanie's facebook page.

154
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:40,940
Now, where it should say "in a relationship," what does it say?

155
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:42,760
"stephanie barnett is single."

156
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:44,693
Yeah, furthermore, earlier this evening,

157
00:08:44,693 --> 00:08:47,220
She threw a digital sheep at some guy named mike.

158
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,160
Who's mike?!

159
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:52,930
Why does he get a digital sheep and not you?

160
00:08:54,570 --> 00:08:57,500
It's just her facebook page and we've

161
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:58,480
Only been going out a couple of weeks.

162
00:08:58,480 --> 00:08:59,540
You don't see it, do you?

163
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:00,880
We're losing her.

164
00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:06,520
Okay, I'm going to make this very simple for you.

165
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:10,280
You are not in this relationship.

166
00:09:11,170 --> 00:09:13,020
I am.

167
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:16,435
Ergo, you have no say in anything

168
00:09:16,435 --> 00:09:19,850
that happens between me and stephanie.

169
00:09:21,670 --> 00:09:23,240
I'm afraid I can't allow that.

170
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:27,077
Pursuant to starfleet general order 104 section a,

171
00:09:27,077 --> 00:09:30,420
You are deemed unfit and I hereby relieve you of your command.

172
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:37,250
General order 104, section a does not apply in this situation.

173
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:38,850
Give me one good reason why not.

174
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:40,530
Because this is not startrek

175
00:09:47,330 --> 00:09:48,220
Penny?

176
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:50,860
Penny? penny?!

177
00:09:52,210 --> 00:09:52,950
What?

178
00:09:53,650 --> 00:09:55,140
This is banana bread.

179
00:09:57,660 --> 00:09:59,250
This is a door knob.

180
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:04,836
It's my understanding that an unsolicited gift of food can

181
00:10:04,836 --> 00:10:08,460
Be a precursor to an impromptu invitation to come in and chat.

182
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:12,920
Sheldon, would you like to come in?

183
00:10:13,290 --> 00:10:15,040
I suppose I could spare a few minutes.

184
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,120
Were you robbed?

185
00:10:22,570 --> 00:10:24,570
No.

186
00:10:25,450 --> 00:10:26,950
How can you be sure?

187
00:10:27,930 --> 00:10:29,430
Sheldon, what do you want?

188
00:10:29,430 --> 00:10:32,034
I'm certain this will come as no surprise to you,

189
00:10:32,034 --> 00:10:34,800
But leonard is failing in yet another relationship.

190
00:10:35,230 --> 00:10:36,520
He's having problems with stephanie?

191
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:39,980
She's sending virtual livestock to random men on the internet.

192
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:43,650
If I have any hope of keeping them together, I need data.

193
00:10:43,650 --> 00:10:44,255
Specifically,

194
00:10:44,255 --> 00:10:46,521
I need to know exactly what leonard did that

195
00:10:46,521 --> 00:10:49,200
Caused you to pop an emotional cap in his buttocks.

196
00:10:51,010 --> 00:10:53,030
What?

197
00:10:53,390 --> 00:10:54,790
Again, urban slang.

198
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:57,570
In which, I believe I'm gaining remarkable fluency.

199
00:10:58,890 --> 00:11:01,260
So, what is the "down" and the "low"?

200
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:03,482
And don't worry, this is all entirely confidential, so,

201
00:11:03,482 --> 00:11:04,861
You feel free to include

202
00:11:04,861 --> 00:11:06,240
any and all shortcomings in the bedroom.

203
00:11:08,390 --> 00:11:09,920
We never got to the bedroom.

204
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:12,700
Because?

205
00:11:14,550 --> 00:11:16,750
Oh, okay, all right, you know what?

206
00:11:17,270 --> 00:11:18,420
I'll tell you what happened.

207
00:11:20,170 --> 00:11:22,636
We were young, we were very much in love,

208
00:11:22,636 --> 00:11:25,100
But we could only communicate through a

209
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:27,690
Time-traveling mailbox at my lake house.

210
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:34,583
It's not enough that you made me watch that movie,

211
00:11:34,583 --> 00:11:35,810
But now you mock me with it?

212
00:11:39,970 --> 00:11:44,500
Gentlemen, I have a question about dating and relationships.

213
00:11:50,350 --> 00:11:52,800
You told me you were going to have the talk with him.

214
00:11:54,170 --> 00:11:56,310
I've been waiting for someone to have the talk with me.

215
00:11:57,610 --> 00:11:58,399
More to the point,

216
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:01,460
It's about finding a way to keep leonard and stephanie together.

217
00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:02,730
Oh, I don't think you can.

218
00:12:02,730 --> 00:12:03,960
Well, why not?

219
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:05,350
Look at leonard's record.

220
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:07,240
27 days with joyce kim.

221
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:09,250
During which she defected to north korea.

222
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:13,260
Two booty calls with leslie winkle.

223
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:15,820
For which she awarded him the nickname "speed of light leonard."

224
00:12:17,430 --> 00:12:19,470
And the three hour dinner with penny.

225
00:12:19,470 --> 00:12:20,733
Which would have been two and a half if

226
00:12:20,733 --> 00:12:22,190
They ordered the souffle when they sat down.

227
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:25,415
Based on the geometric progression,

228
00:12:25,415 --> 00:12:26,942
His relationship with stephanie

229
00:12:26,942 --> 00:12:28,470
should have ended after 20 minutes.

230
00:12:29,210 --> 00:12:30,560
Yes, I'm aware of the math.

231
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:32,930
Y equals 27 days over 12 to the nth.

232
00:12:32,930 --> 00:12:34,590
The issue remains.

233
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:38,190
How do we circumvent his inevitable rejection?

234
00:12:38,590 --> 00:12:40,927
Well, if you want to guarantee his appeal to stephanie,

235
00:12:40,927 --> 00:12:43,740
Your best bet would be to kill all the other men on the planet.

236
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:47,270
I'll tell you what you shouldn't do.

237
00:12:47,270 --> 00:12:49,085
Don't shpritz him with that body spray from the

238
00:12:49,085 --> 00:12:51,210
Commercial where the women undress when they smell it.

239
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:52,230
That doesn't work at all.

240
00:12:56,430 --> 00:12:58,220
No matter how much you put on.

241
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:00,860
So, that's all you've got?

242
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:03,520
Apocalyptic genocide and "go easy on the cologne"?

243
00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:07,310
Yeah. yes.

244
00:13:10,370 --> 00:13:11,090
Penny.

245
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:12,740
Penny?

246
00:13:13,330 --> 00:13:14,230
What?

247
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:20,670
Penny?

248
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:27,720
Zucchini bread.

249
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:30,200
Oh, thank you.

250
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:30,910
May I come in?

251
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:31,320
No.

252
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:33,560
I see.

253
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:34,612
Apparently,

254
00:13:34,612 --> 00:13:36,261
My earlier inquiry regarding

255
00:13:36,261 --> 00:13:37,910
you and leonard crossed some sort of line.

256
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,130
I apologize.

257
00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:42,190
Well, thank you.

258
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:44,590
So, have you and I returned to a social equilibrium?

259
00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:46,030
Yes. great.

260
00:13:46,030 --> 00:13:47,030
New topic.

261
00:13:47,030 --> 00:13:50,040
Where are you in your menstrual cycle?

262
00:13:53,390 --> 00:13:54,260
What?!

263
00:13:54,260 --> 00:13:56,290
I've been doing some research online,

264
00:13:56,290 --> 00:13:58,321
and apparently female primates,

265
00:13:58,321 --> 00:14:00,650
You know, uh, apes, chimpanzees, you.

266
00:14:02,350 --> 00:14:03,898
They find their mate more desirable

267
00:14:03,898 --> 00:14:05,800
When he's being courted by another female.

268
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:08,469
Now, This effect is intensified when the rival female

269
00:14:08,469 --> 00:14:11,350
Is secreting the pheromones associated with ovulation.

270
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:12,880
Which brings me back to my question.

271
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:14,540
Where are you in your--

272
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:19,840
Clearly, I'm 14 days too early.

273
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:25,396
All I'm saying is if they can cure yellow fever and malaria,

274
00:14:25,396 --> 00:14:28,220
Why can't they do something about lactose intolerance?

275
00:14:31,050 --> 00:14:32,920
Leonard, you're going to have to let this go.

276
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:34,890
You had a little cheese dip, you farted.

277
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:36,170
I thought it was cute.

278
00:14:38,950 --> 00:14:40,280
Oh, hi, stephanie.

279
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:43,160
Wanna more wine?

280
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:46,940
Yeah, I'm not driving anywhere tonight.

281
00:14:59,370 --> 00:15:00,590
What are you doing?

282
00:15:00,590 --> 00:15:02,711
I have a craving for white asparagus

283
00:15:02,711 --> 00:15:05,480
That apparently is destined to go unsatisfied.

284
00:15:11,230 --> 00:15:12,050
Excuse me.

285
00:15:15,210 --> 00:15:16,460
What the hell is wrong with you?

286
00:15:16,460 --> 00:15:17,680
I'm helping you with stephanie.

287
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:19,750
By making constipated moose sounds?

288
00:15:21,450 --> 00:15:23,580
When I fail to open this jar and you succeed,

289
00:15:23,580 --> 00:15:25,710
It will establish you as the "alpha" male.

290
00:15:25,710 --> 00:15:26,450
You see...

291
00:15:26,810 --> 00:15:29,791
When a female witnesses an exhibition of physical domination,

292
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:31,580
She produces the hormone oxytocin.

293
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:33,631
If the two of you then engage in intercourse,

294
00:15:33,631 --> 00:15:36,194
This will create the biochemical reaction in the brain

295
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:38,900
Which lay people naively interpret as "falling in love."

296
00:15:44,150 --> 00:15:46,140
Would it work if I just punched you in the face?

297
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:50,180
Yes, actually it would, but let's see how the lid goes.

298
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:55,110
I'm not strong enough, leonard, you'll have to do it.

299
00:15:56,230 --> 00:15:57,750
Oh, for god's sakes.

300
00:15:57,750 --> 00:15:59,130
Go ahead, it's pre-loosened.

301
00:16:13,770 --> 00:16:14,960
Do you want some help with that?

302
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:18,890
No, no, no, I got it.

303
00:16:18,890 --> 00:16:21,380
No, yeah, yeah, he's got it, and that's not surprising.

304
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:23,208
This is something I long ago came to

305
00:16:23,208 --> 00:16:25,240
Peace with in my role as the beta male.

306
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:29,240
Open it.

307
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:38,900
- Oh, my god, are you okay? - no, I'm not.

308
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:39,840
I'm bleeding.

309
00:16:39,850 --> 00:16:41,260
Like a gladiator!

310
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:44,420
Oh, honey, you're going to need stitches.

311
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:46,120
Stitches? with a needle?

312
00:16:46,790 --> 00:16:48,470
Well, yeah, I mean, just a few.

313
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:52,010
Oh, okay, yeah, hang on a sec.

314
00:17:02,570 --> 00:17:05,220
Fyi, I was defrosting a steak in there.

315
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:11,860
What a beautiful job stephanie did.

316
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:14,055
I might have gone with a mattress suture

317
00:17:14,055 --> 00:17:15,371
instead of a blanket stitch,

318
00:17:15,371 --> 00:17:16,880
But you can't argue with her results.

319
00:17:17,770 --> 00:17:19,440
It's a shame it won't scar.

320
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:22,770
The war wound is a time-honored badge of masculinity.

321
00:17:24,810 --> 00:17:27,950
I can't remember a time when you weren't talking.

322
00:17:29,290 --> 00:17:30,216
Just for the record,

323
00:17:30,216 --> 00:17:32,209
My efforts to establish you as the alpha

324
00:17:32,209 --> 00:17:34,600
Male were not aided by you bursting into tears.

325
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:37,970
I did not burst into tears, my eyes just got a little watery.

326
00:17:37,970 --> 00:17:39,080
Watery?

327
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:42,180
She stuck a needle into my hand!

328
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:45,600
Hey, how's my big cry baby?

329
00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:48,470
I didn't cry.

330
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:51,300
Okay, I'm just teasing you.

331
00:17:51,630 --> 00:17:52,900
But, yeah, you did.

332
00:17:54,260 --> 00:17:54,920
Okay, it's all good.

333
00:17:54,930 --> 00:17:56,830
What do you say we get you home and put you to bed?

334
00:17:56,830 --> 00:17:58,870
Oh, are you still going to spend the night?

335
00:17:59,230 --> 00:18:01,880
Uh, no, I think that you probably need to rest.

336
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:03,615
She's right. as long as you're vomiting,

337
00:18:03,615 --> 00:18:05,350
coitus is contra-indicated.

338
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,090
Thank you, dr. cooper.

339
00:18:09,090 --> 00:18:11,510
You're welcome, dr. hofstadter.

340
00:18:14,710 --> 00:18:17,000
Okay, I'm going to go get your discharge papers.

341
00:18:20,490 --> 00:18:21,530
What?

342
00:18:21,530 --> 00:18:24,260
Well, you seem like a perfectly pleasant person.

343
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:27,350
I can't understand why women have such a hard time loving you.

344
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:35,860
Hey, can you open this for me?

345
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,140
Can I see your stitches?

346
00:18:38,140 --> 00:18:38,650
Sure.

347
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:46,735
Answering the question once and for all

348
00:18:46,735 --> 00:18:48,560
Why wolowitz bailed out of medical school.

349
00:18:50,130 --> 00:18:51,840
Leonard, congratulations.

350
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:52,690
What for?

351
00:18:52,690 --> 00:18:54,670
Your facebook status update.

352
00:18:54,670 --> 00:18:57,920
Leonard hofstadter is "in a relationship."

353
00:18:57,920 --> 00:19:00,150
What? no. no, that's not right.

354
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:03,930
Oh, man, did you switch your status before she did?

355
00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:08,240
Speaking as an expert, way to look needy.

356
00:19:09,630 --> 00:19:10,440
Seriously?

357
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:12,070
You went first, after only two weeks?

358
00:19:12,070 --> 00:19:14,270
That's bold...

359
00:19:14,590 --> 00:19:16,450
It's not bold, it's a mistake.

360
00:19:16,450 --> 00:19:18,260
I didn't change my status.

361
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:19,750
Well, then who did?

362
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:27,290
I had no choice. he cried in front of her.

363
00:19:29,150 --> 00:19:31,590
You hacked my facebook account?

364
00:19:31,590 --> 00:19:33,625
Oh, it's hardly hacking

365
00:19:33,625 --> 00:19:35,661
when you use the same password for everything,

366
00:19:35,661 --> 00:19:36,310
"kal-el."

367
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:39,110
Are you insane?

368
00:19:39,110 --> 00:19:41,050
Now she's going to think I'm desperate.

369
00:19:41,050 --> 00:19:43,390
You've destroyed this relationship!

370
00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:45,330
And you want to know what the worst part is?

371
00:19:45,330 --> 00:19:48,081
You don't even understand what you did wrong because you

372
00:19:48,081 --> 00:19:50,980
Can't conceive of something that you are not an expert in!

373
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:53,010
In which I am not an expert.

374
00:19:53,010 --> 00:19:53,990
Don't even!

375
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:59,840
I don't want to hear another word out of you.

376
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:05,830
What's wrong, lassie? timmy fall down the well?

377
00:20:11,170 --> 00:20:13,320
She just updated her facebook status.

378
00:20:13,810 --> 00:20:15,800
"stephanie barnett is in a relationship

379
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:17,790
with leonard hofstadter."

380
00:20:19,170 --> 00:20:20,230
Really?

381
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:24,150
Oh, look at that.

382
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:25,820
I have a girlfriend.

383
00:20:27,190 --> 00:20:29,435
If I am permitted to speak again,

384
00:20:29,435 --> 00:20:31,680
dr. sheldon cooper for the win.
