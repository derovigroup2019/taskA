1
00:00:10,220 --> 00:00:12,540
Good morning, Leonard.

2
00:00:13,350 --> 00:00:15,610
Yeah. We're gonna have to stop by
Pottery Barn on the way to work.

3
00:00:15,620 --> 00:00:20,220
I bought these Star Wars sheets, but
they turned out to be much too stimulating

4
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:22,970
to be compatible with
a good night's sleep.

5
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:28,130
I don't like the way
Darth Vader stares at me.

6
00:00:28,990 --> 00:00:30,440
I'm not going to work.

7
00:00:30,470 --> 00:00:32,830
Oh, just because your career's
been stagnant for a few years,

8
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:35,070
that's no reason to give up.

9
00:00:35,510 --> 00:00:38,770
Sheldon, I was up all night
using the new free-electron laser

10
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:41,400
for my X-ray diffraction experiment.

11
00:00:41,410 --> 00:00:44,340
Did the laser accidentally
burn out your retinas?

12
00:00:44,350 --> 00:00:47,200
- No.
- Then you can drive. Let's go.

13
00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:53,540
Didn't I tell you I'd be working nights and
that you'd have to make other arrangements?

14
00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:55,160
- You did.
- And?

15
00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:57,230
I didn't.

16
00:00:57,860 --> 00:01:00,170
Let's go.

17
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:01,510
Good night, Sheldon.

18
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:03,120
But how am I going to get to work?

19
00:01:03,150 --> 00:01:05,470
- Take the bus.
- I can't take the bus anymore.

20
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:10,060
They don't have seat belts, and they won't let
you latch yourself to the seat with bungee cords.

21
00:01:10,690 --> 00:01:13,660
You tried to latch yourself
to the seat with bungee cords?

22
00:01:13,690 --> 00:01:16,240
I didn't try. I succeeded.

23
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:21,230
But for some reason, it alarmed the other
passengers and I was asked to de-bus.

24
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:23,920
Oh, you're a big boy.
You'll figure it out.

25
00:01:23,930 --> 00:01:26,100
Don't talk to me like I'm a child.

26
00:01:26,110 --> 00:01:29,200
Now, take me to return
my Star Wars sheets!

27
00:01:31,310 --> 00:01:35,060
Penny? Penny? Penny?

28
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:37,950
Sheldon. What is it?

29
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:40,190
Leonard's asleep.

30
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,770
- Thanks for the update.
- No. Wait.

31
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:47,740
You have to drive me to work.

32
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:50,500
Yeah, I really don't think I do.

33
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:53,260
But I don't drive, and
I can't take the bus.

34
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:56,050
Honey, you'll be fine as long as you
don't do that bungee cord thing, okay?

35
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:58,030
Penny.

36
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:03,040
Didn't you recently state
that you and I are friends?

37
00:02:03,050 --> 00:02:06,120
Yes, Sheldon. We are friends.

38
00:02:06,130 --> 00:02:11,960
Then I hereby invoke what I'm given to understand is
an integral part of the implied covenant of friendship.

39
00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:18,080
The favor.

40
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:21,230
Oh, dear God.

41
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:24,910
I'm sorry, I didn't realize I was
interrupting your morning prayers.

42
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:28,200
When you're done, we'll go.

43
00:02:29,410 --> 00:02:37,290

44
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:46,850

45
00:02:47,170 --> 00:02:52,420

46
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:56,570
Thank you for driving me to work.

47
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:58,400
You know this is my day off, Sheldon.

48
00:02:58,410 --> 00:03:01,030
Oh, good. I'm not
keeping you from anything.

49
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:07,200
Your "check engine" light is on.

50
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:12,220
Typically that's an indicator
to, you know, check your engine.

51
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:15,160
It's fine. It's been
on for, like, a month.

52
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:18,010
Well, actually, that would
be all the more reason to...

53
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:20,880
you know, check your engine.

54
00:03:20,890 --> 00:03:22,600
Sheldon, it's fine.

55
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:24,470
If it were fine, the
light wouldn't be on.

56
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:28,650
That's why the manufacturer installed
that light, to let you know it's not fine.

57
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:31,490
Maybe the light's broken.

58
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:34,550
Is there a "check the
'check engine light' light"?

59
00:03:37,530 --> 00:03:38,830
What?

60
00:03:38,850 --> 00:03:41,480
Studies have shown that
performing tasks such as eating,

61
00:03:41,510 --> 00:03:45,780
talking on a cell phone or drinking coffee
while driving reduces one's reaction time

62
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:48,240
by the same factor as
an ounce of alcohol.

63
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:49,990
Do you have any alcohol?

64
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:52,830
- Of course not.
- Too bad.

65
00:03:55,310 --> 00:03:57,780
You're going up Euclid Avenue?

66
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:00,490
Leonard takes Los Robles Avenue.

67
00:04:00,530 --> 00:04:02,360
Well, good for Leonard.

68
00:04:02,370 --> 00:04:06,120
Euclid Avenue is shorter as the
crow flies, but it has speed bumps,

69
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:11,220
which appreciably increase point-to-point
drive time, making it the less efficient choice.

70
00:04:12,090 --> 00:04:14,600
But you have the conn.

71
00:04:17,610 --> 00:04:19,380
Of course, if you're not going
to slow down fothe speed bumps,

72
00:04:19,410 --> 00:04:22,240
I withdraw my previous objection.

73
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:25,620
Here's a fun question.

74
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:28,290
Do you know what the most
common street name is?

75
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:30,610
- No.
- The answer's tricky.

76
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,180
It's Second Street.

77
00:04:33,210 --> 00:04:35,810
You see, you'd think it would be
First Street, but in most towns,

78
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:38,100
First Street eventually gets
renamed to something else.

79
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:41,830
You know, like Main
Street, Broad Street.

80
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:44,050
Michigan Avenue.

81
00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:49,010
See, Leonard and I often use our commute time to
exercise our minds with brain-teasers like that.

82
00:04:49,030 --> 00:04:51,960
We also play games.

83
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:55,020
- Would you like to play one?
- No.

84
00:04:55,030 --> 00:04:57,430
Oh, come on. It's fun.

85
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:59,890
Another bump.

86
00:05:01,030 --> 00:05:04,440
Okay. I'll say an element,
and, and you say an element

87
00:05:04,450 --> 00:05:08,160
whose name starts with the last
letter of the one I said, okay?

88
00:05:09,190 --> 00:05:11,320
I'll start.

89
00:05:11,850 --> 00:05:14,440
Helium.

90
00:05:16,770 --> 00:05:19,520
Now, you could say "mercury."

91
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:23,370
That would give me a "y." Very
clever. That's a tough one.

92
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:27,320
So I go with "ytterbium,"
which gets you back to "m."

93
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:31,520
So you go "molybdenum,"
and I say "magnesium."

94
00:05:31,570 --> 00:05:33,130
You say "manganese."

95
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:37,180
I say "europium," and, then, you're
left with "mendelevium," and...

96
00:05:37,210 --> 00:05:40,940
there are no more m's because I believe that
meitnerium should still be called ekairidium.

97
00:05:40,970 --> 00:05:43,630
So, congratulations. You win.

98
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:50,780
Do you wanna go again?

99
00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:53,680
Why don't we just have
a little quiet time now?

100
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:55,960
All right.

101
00:06:00,290 --> 00:06:01,080
I'm sorry.

102
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:06,170
I'm finding your reckless nonchalance regarding
the check-engine light to be very troubling.

103
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:11,700
Get out.

104
00:06:12,610 --> 00:06:13,720
Well, I have to tell you that

105
00:06:13,730 --> 00:06:17,650
while I do have a theoretical understanding of
the workings of an internal combustion engine,

106
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:20,890
I'm not sure I'm capable
of performing diagnostics.

107
00:06:20,910 --> 00:06:22,920
I said, "Get out."

108
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:25,740
Okay. I'll give it a shot.

109
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:41,190
Oh, Leonard. There you are.

110
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:43,650
I'm ready to go home.

111
00:06:44,530 --> 00:06:47,620
- I just got here.
- Good. Perfect timing.

112
00:06:48,370 --> 00:06:51,780
Sheldon, I told you, I only have access
to the free-electron laser at night.

113
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:53,490
I can't drive you for
the next few weeks.

114
00:06:53,510 --> 00:06:55,800
No, you said you
couldn't drive me to work.

115
00:06:55,810 --> 00:06:58,530
This is from work.

116
00:06:58,540 --> 00:07:00,300
Howard, help me out here.

117
00:07:00,310 --> 00:07:03,620
No, just for the fun of
it, I'm gonna take his side.

118
00:07:04,970 --> 00:07:07,520
Now, how do you propose I get home?

119
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:09,280
How did you get here in the first place?

120
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:10,610
Penny.

121
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:13,330
But I sense that's no longer an option.

122
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:16,110
Look, I need to get to the laser lab.

123
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:19,860
You're just gonna have to find
someone else to take you home.

124
00:07:25,790 --> 00:07:28,680
Ah, damn, I picked the wrong side.

125
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,490
Oh, God, not Euclid Avenue!

126
00:07:43,790 --> 00:07:47,070
Why did Howard leave you in
the middle of the road anyway?

127
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:50,070
We had a difference of opinion.

128
00:07:50,090 --> 00:07:51,720
Over what?

129
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:54,330
Whether or not he was trying to kill me.

130
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:57,570
For the record, I maintain he was.

131
00:07:58,680 --> 00:07:59,640
Where are you going?

132
00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:00,760
I'm taking you home.

133
00:08:00,790 --> 00:08:03,060
Oh, but I'm not going
home. It's Wednesday.

134
00:08:03,070 --> 00:08:04,450
Wednesday's new comic book day.

135
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:07,060
We have to go to the comic book store.

136
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:10,990
And then, we have to stop at Soup
Plantation; it's creamy tomato soup day.

137
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,250
And Radio Shack. There's a
sale on triple-A batteries.

138
00:08:14,530 --> 00:08:18,310
Plus, we have to go to Pottery
Barn and return my Star Wars sheets.

139
00:08:18,330 --> 00:08:20,660
I have a better idea.

140
00:08:20,690 --> 00:08:23,930
You want to go to Pottery Barn first?

141
00:08:34,410 --> 00:08:37,750
Can you drive me to Pottery Barn?

142
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:46,290
Maybe if I turn off the
night-light, I can keep the sheets.

143
00:08:58,070 --> 00:09:01,040
Good morning.

144
00:09:01,050 --> 00:09:03,280
Good morning.

145
00:09:03,290 --> 00:09:05,410
Sheldon, sit down.

146
00:09:05,430 --> 00:09:08,320
She's in my spot.

147
00:09:09,710 --> 00:09:12,690
Don't look at me like that.
Everybody knows that's my spot.

148
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:21,920
Sheldon, you know
that we care about you.

149
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:26,390
And it's because we care about you
that we've decided we have to speak up.

150
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:32,830
You're hurting the people
around you, sweetie.

151
00:09:32,850 --> 00:09:36,650
So we made you an appointment,
and we want you to keep it.

152
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:41,930
Department of Motor
Vehicles New Driver Handbook?

153
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:48,160
But I don't have a problem.

154
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:51,430
Sheldon, you need to learn how to drive.

155
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:54,460
This madness has to stop.

156
00:09:55,210 --> 00:09:57,750
Penny's taking you to
the DMV. I'm going to bed.

157
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:58,870
Why Penny?

158
00:09:58,890 --> 00:10:01,990
Because rock breaks
scissors. Good night.

159
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:04,590
All right, come on, Sheldon.

160
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:06,870
Hold on. I have one condition.

161
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:07,700
What?

162
00:10:07,710 --> 00:10:10,120
We have to stop at Pottery Barn.

163
00:10:10,550 --> 00:10:11,930
Okay.

164
00:10:11,950 --> 00:10:14,350
And Radio Shack.

165
00:10:14,370 --> 00:10:16,510
Fine.

166
00:10:16,530 --> 00:10:19,280
- And the comic book store.
- All right!

167
00:10:19,290 --> 00:10:22,460
Ooh, I want to go to
the comic book store.

168
00:10:41,190 --> 00:10:43,730
I like comic books.

169
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:50,390
I just don't see why I
need a driver's license.

170
00:10:50,410 --> 00:10:53,950
Albert Einstein never
had a driver's license.

171
00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:58,800
Yeah, but Albert Einstein didn't make
me wet myself at 40 miles an hour.

172
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:03,020
Yeah, and I never wanted to
kick Albert Einstein in the nuts.

173
00:11:06,190 --> 00:11:10,100
You know, I gotta ask, why didn't you just
get a license at 16 like everybody else?

174
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:13,520
I was otherwise engaged.

175
00:11:13,550 --> 00:11:15,060
Doing what?

176
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:18,630
Examining perturbative amplitudes
in N=4 supersymmetric theories

177
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:23,040
leading to a re-examination of the ultraviolet
properties of multi-loop N=8 supergravity

178
00:11:23,050 --> 00:11:25,820
using modern twistor theory.

179
00:11:28,730 --> 00:11:31,910
Well, how 'bout when you were 17?

180
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:34,880
Take this to the testing
area, put your name at the top,

181
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:38,480
sign the bottom, answer the
questions, bring it back. Next.

182
00:11:44,190 --> 00:11:46,170
Application?

183
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:49,360
I'm actually more of a theorist.

184
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:54,490
The application in your
hand. Give it to her.

185
00:11:58,250 --> 00:12:00,270
Take this to the testing
area, put your name at the top,

186
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:03,150
sign the bottom, answer the
questions, bring it back. Next!

187
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:07,470
Excuse me, but I have some
concerns about these questions.

188
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:10,090
Look at that sign up there.

189
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:11,040
Yes?

190
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:13,770
Does it say "I give a damn"?

191
00:12:15,730 --> 00:12:16,460
No.

192
00:12:16,470 --> 00:12:18,780
That's because I don't.

193
00:12:18,790 --> 00:12:21,760
Just look. See, this first
question makes no sense.

194
00:12:21,770 --> 00:12:25,570
"How many car lengths should you
leave in front of you when driving?"

195
00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:27,950
There's no possible way to answer that.

196
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:31,780
A "car length" is not a
standardized unit of measure.

197
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:34,670
Look at the sign.

198
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:36,440
Sheldon, it's "C." Just put down "C."

199
00:12:36,450 --> 00:12:37,780
I don't need your help, Penny.

200
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:40,490
Listen to that little
girl, honey. Put "C." Next!

201
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:42,970
No, wait! No, hang on.
Look at this next question.

202
00:12:42,980 --> 00:12:46,750
Sheldon, why are you
arguing with the DMV?

203
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:50,430
How else are they going to learn?

204
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:55,590
Look... question two: When
are roadways most slippery?

205
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:58,140
Now, okay, there are three
answers, none of which are correct.

206
00:12:58,180 --> 00:13:03,110
The correct answer is "when covered by "a film of liquid
sufficient to reduce the coefficient of static friction"

207
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:05,210
"between the tire and the
road to essentially zero,

208
00:13:05,230 --> 00:13:09,170
but not so deep as to introduce
a new source of friction."

209
00:13:12,990 --> 00:13:15,870
Here's your learner's permit. Go away.

210
00:13:16,690 --> 00:13:20,090
But I'm not done. I have many additional
concerns about these questions.

211
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:21,450
Don't make me climb over this counter.

212
00:13:21,470 --> 00:13:24,010
Come on. Let's go.

213
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:27,090
Next!

214
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:29,150
Aced it.

215
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:35,260
Okay, that's it. Let's boot it up.

216
00:13:35,270 --> 00:13:37,440
Booting.

217
00:13:37,450 --> 00:13:39,330
This is a
state-of-the-art simulator.

218
00:13:39,350 --> 00:13:42,250
I adapted it from something a
friend of mine designed for the army.

219
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:46,990
Is that why I appear to be in downtown Fallujah
behind the wheel of an up-armored Humvee?

220
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:50,210
I haven't configured it yet.

221
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:55,320
Let's see... Bradley tank...
transport truck... Batmobile...

222
00:13:55,330 --> 00:13:57,410
No.

223
00:13:57,710 --> 00:14:02,540
Here we go. Red 2006 Ford Taurus
on the streets of Pasadena.

224
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:05,010
What?

225
00:14:05,030 --> 00:14:09,080
Statistically, red cars are stopped by
police far more often than any other color.

226
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:12,450
I don't want any hassles with the fuzz.

227
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:14,920
Fine, what color do you want?

228
00:14:14,950 --> 00:14:18,970
You know the pale blue of
Luke Skywalker's lightsaber?

229
00:14:19,770 --> 00:14:23,880
Before it was digitally remastered?

230
00:14:24,830 --> 00:14:28,090
Black, it is.

231
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:32,350
Okay, now, what you want to do first is
turn on the ignition and shift into drive.

232
00:14:32,370 --> 00:14:35,660
I haven't fastened my seat belt yet.

233
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:40,110
Okay, fasten your seat belt.

234
00:14:45,710 --> 00:14:47,540
"Click".

235
00:14:49,130 --> 00:14:50,110
Now, are there air bags?

236
00:14:50,130 --> 00:14:51,420
You don't need air bags.

237
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:53,280
What if a simulated van rear-ends me?

238
00:14:53,290 --> 00:14:56,010
I'll hit you in the face with a pillow.

239
00:15:04,910 --> 00:15:07,300
Okay, now shift into drive.

240
00:15:07,330 --> 00:15:10,660
Pull out slowly into traffic.

241
00:15:11,850 --> 00:15:15,050
Watch out, watch, watch
out for the pedestrians!

242
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:19,470
Oh, God. Wait-- slow--
Hit the brakes! The brakes!

243
00:15:30,830 --> 00:15:33,070
Thank you.

244
00:15:35,730 --> 00:15:38,460
Sorry. Excuse me.

245
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:42,230
My bad.

246
00:15:44,010 --> 00:15:46,640
Student driver.

247
00:15:47,650 --> 00:15:51,870
How did you manage to get on the
second floor of the Glendale Galleria?

248
00:15:52,060 --> 00:15:54,750
I don't know. I was on
the Pasadena freeway.

249
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:59,420
I missed my exit, flew off the
overpass, and one thing led to another.

250
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:04,010
Maybe you want to give it a
rest and try again tomorrow.

251
00:16:04,030 --> 00:16:07,200
No. I quit.

252
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:16,920
Aw, the pet store.

253
00:16:18,380 --> 00:16:22,590
Remind me to compliment Wolowitz on
the software. It's amazingly detailed.

254
00:16:24,050 --> 00:16:26,210
So wait, you're just gonna give up?

255
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:29,910
No, I'm not giving up. I never give up.

256
00:16:30,510 --> 00:16:32,830
So, what is it you're doing?

257
00:16:32,850 --> 00:16:36,710
I'm... transcending the situation.

258
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:44,550
I'm clearly too evolved for driving.

259
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:48,680
What does that mean?

260
00:16:48,690 --> 00:16:53,450
Leonard, have you ever wondered why
my little toes and lateral incisors

261
00:16:53,460 --> 00:16:58,080
are significantly smaller than
the average for someone of my size?

262
00:16:59,290 --> 00:17:02,960
I wonder a lot of things about
you, Sheldon. But not-not that.

263
00:17:03,670 --> 00:17:08,840
Well, those are indicators that I'm farther along
the evolutionary scale than the average human.

264
00:17:08,860 --> 00:17:10,310
- No kidding.
- Well, no, no.

265
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:15,000
I'm not gonna go so far as to say that I
represent a distinct new stage in humankind--

266
00:17:15,020 --> 00:17:18,290
you know, a homo novus, if you will.

267
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:21,690
No, that's for
anthropologists to decide.

268
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:26,720
But I am convinced that the reason I
cannot master the plebeian task of driving

269
00:17:26,770 --> 00:17:28,950
is because I'm not meant to.

270
00:17:28,970 --> 00:17:31,130
Yes, you are. You're meant
to learn how to drive.

271
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:34,170
- Please learn how to drive!
- No, no.

272
00:17:34,180 --> 00:17:37,910
Leonard, I'm meant for greater things, like
unraveling the mysteries of the universe,

273
00:17:37,930 --> 00:17:43,230
not determining when it's safe to pass
a stopped school bus on a country road.

274
00:17:44,710 --> 00:17:47,580
- It's never safe.
- Yeah, well, I know that now.

275
00:17:49,390 --> 00:17:52,510
Fine. Assuming that
everything you say is true,

276
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:57,460
how does the biologically superior
homo novus get to work tomorrow morning?

277
00:17:57,850 --> 00:18:00,850
Homo novus doesn't know.

278
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:03,350
Well, hang in there.

279
00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:06,750
Maybe you'll evolve into
something with wings.

280
00:18:17,530 --> 00:18:19,140
Good morning, gentlemen.

281
00:18:19,150 --> 00:18:21,150
Good morning.

282
00:18:22,230 --> 00:18:25,850
Is there some new kind of
casual Friday I don't know about?

283
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:28,500
No, he lives here now.

284
00:18:28,530 --> 00:18:29,650
Really? Why?

285
00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:32,860
Well, since he won't take the
bus and he's too evolved to drive,

286
00:18:32,870 --> 00:18:34,950
he decided it would be easier
to just sleep in his office

287
00:18:34,990 --> 00:18:38,760
and shower in the radiation lab
until I'm finished with my experiment.

288
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:42,750
But you finished your
experiment a week ago.

289
00:18:46,010 --> 00:18:47,920
Yep.

290
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:58,460

291
00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:00,340

292
00:19:00,350 --> 00:19:02,760

293
00:19:02,770 --> 00:19:05,330

294
00:19:05,340 --> 00:19:08,490

295
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:20,310
You saw nothing!
