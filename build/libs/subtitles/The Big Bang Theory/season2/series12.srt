what bathtubs are capable of doing...

342
00:19:47,477 --> 00:19:49,437
...when you don't treat them
with respect.

343
00:19:49,938 --> 00:19:51,397
Yeah.

344
00:19:51,648 --> 00:19:54,609
They sucker-punch you
when your eyes are closed.

345
00:19:56,278 --> 00:19:58,112
So, what do you think, Howard?

346
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:00,323
It... It's not that bad, right?

347
00:20:00,866 --> 00:20:03,910
Yeah, no.
A little electrical tape, some solder...

348
00:20:04,077 --> 00:20:05,620
Are you insane?

349
00:20:05,787 --> 00:20:10,333
I've seen space probes that crashed into the
desert that were in better shape than this.

350
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:13,044
You're right.

351
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:14,629
Monte's gone.

352
00:20:14,796 --> 00:20:18,132
We'll bury him in the morning.
A simple ceremony. I'll speak.

353
00:20:18,717 --> 00:20:20,968
Leonard, you'll play your cello.

354
00:20:21,845 --> 00:20:26,098
Sheldon, honey, aren't you getting a little
carried away? I mean, it's just a toy robot.

355
00:20:28,477 --> 00:20:30,353
Just a toy robot?

356
00:20:36,401 --> 00:20:37,610
Penny.

357
00:20:37,778 --> 00:20:38,986
I know, I got it.

358
00:20:39,988 --> 00:20:43,449
Sheldon? I'm sorry.

359
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:46,994
Well, don't get the wrong idea.

360
00:20:47,162 --> 00:20:50,539
The way I see it,
I'm halfway to pity sex.

361
