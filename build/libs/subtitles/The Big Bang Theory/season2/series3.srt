1
00:00:01,030 --> 00:00:02,560
Fellow warriors,

2
00:00:02,630 --> 00:00:04,130
This is sheldor the conqueror.

3
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:06,300
We are about to enter axidus' fortress.

4
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:10,830
Now, this is a long run, so let's do another bladder check.

5
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:13,800
All right, barry, we'll wait for you again,

6
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:16,800
But you really  should see a doctor.

7
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:22,560
Sheldor is afk.

8
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:30,430
Penny, are you experiencing some sort of difficulty?

9
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:32,630
Yes. I can't get  my stupid door open.

10
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:34,230
You appear to have put  your car key

11
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:36,100
In the door lock-- are you aware of that?

12
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:39,160
Yeah.

13
00:00:39,230 --> 00:00:41,660
All right, then.

14
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:43,830
Damn it,

15
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:45,660
Damn it, damn it, damn it, damn it!

16
00:00:45,730 --> 00:00:49,030
Would it be possible for you to do this a little more quietly?

17
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:52,130
I can't get the damn key out.

18
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:54,630
Well, it's not surprising-- that baldwin lock on your door

19
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:56,260
Uses traditional edge-mounted cylinders,

20
00:00:56,330 --> 00:00:57,960
Whereas the key for your volkswagen

21
00:00:58,030 --> 00:01:00,800
Uses a center cylinder system.

22
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,860
Thank you, sheldon.

23
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:05,700
You're welcome.

24
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:08,800
Why did you put

25
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:10,600
Your car key in the door lock?

26
00:01:10,660 --> 00:01:12,630
Why? I'll tell you why-- because today I had an audition,

27
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:14,100
It took me two hours  to get there,

28
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:15,400
I waited an hour for my turn,

29
00:01:15,460 --> 00:01:16,560
And before I could even start,

30
00:01:16,630 --> 00:01:18,160
They told me  I looked too midwest

31
00:01:18,230 --> 00:01:19,660
For the part.

32
00:01:19,730 --> 00:01:21,660
Too midwest-- what the hell  does that even mean?

33
00:01:21,730 --> 00:01:23,630
Well, the american midwest was mostly settled

34
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:25,830
By scandinavian and germanic people.

35
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:28,560
They have a characteristic facial bone structure...

36
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:30,800
I know what it means, sheldon!

37
00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:33,700
God! you know, I have been in l.a. for almost two years now,

38
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:35,960
And I haven't gotten  a single acting job.

39
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:37,660
I've accomplished nothing, haven't gotten

40
00:01:37,730 --> 00:01:40,130
A raise at work, haven't   even had sex in six months,

41
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:42,500
And just now, when I was    walking up those stairs,

42
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:46,130
A fly flew in my mouth  and I ate it!

43
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:49,360
Well, actually, insects are a dietary staple in many cultures.

44
00:01:49,430 --> 00:01:50,930
They're almost pure protein.

45
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:54,760
Oh, son of a bitch!

46
00:01:54,830 --> 00:01:57,100
I believe the condensation on your frozen foods

47
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:59,760
Weakened the structural integrity of the bag.

48
00:02:04,130 --> 00:02:05,560
But returning to your key conundrum,

49
00:02:05,630 --> 00:02:07,100
Perhaps you should call a locksmith

50
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:09,600
And have him  open the door for you. I did.

51
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:11,860
He said he'll get here   when he gets here.

52
00:02:11,930 --> 00:02:13,900
And you're frustrated  because he phrased his reply

53
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:16,660
In the form of a meaningless tautology? no!

54
00:02:16,730 --> 00:02:19,930
I am frustrated because I am a failure at everything

55
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,260
And my breath smells like fly.

56
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,400
There, there.

57
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:38,560
Would you prefer to wait in our apartment?

58
00:02:38,630 --> 00:02:40,730
No, sheldon, I'd rather sit on this freezing-cold floor

59
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,200
Sobbing like a three-year-old.

60
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:44,100
All right, then.

61
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:47,260
For heaven's sake.

62
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:53,800
Just when I think I've gotten the hang of sarcasm.

63
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:21,400
Make yourself comfortable.

64
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:23,460
Not there.

65
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:55,060
Sheldor is back online.

66
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:57,930
Sheldor?

67
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,260
The conqueror.

68
00:04:00,330 --> 00:04:02,560
What are you doing?

69
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:05,230
Afk.

70
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:07,360
I'm playing

71
00:04:07,430 --> 00:04:09,230
Age of conan,   an online multiplayer game

72
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:11,400
Set in the universe of robert e. howard's

73
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:13,030
Conan the barbarian.

74
00:04:15,530 --> 00:04:18,700
Sheldor back online.

75
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:20,030
What's "afk"?

76
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:21,760
Afk.

77
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:26,500
Away from keyboard.

78
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,560
Oh, I see.

79
00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:32,260
What does that stand for?

80
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:38,560
Oh, I see.

81
00:04:38,630 --> 00:04:42,260
Yes, but what does it stand for?

82
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:58,460
Now, just click on the enchanted boots to put them on.

83
00:04:58,530 --> 00:05:02,030
Mm, I don't know-- can I see them in another color?

84
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:04,100
Just click on them.

85
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:06,260
Yeah, congratulations.

86
00:05:06,330 --> 00:05:07,760
You are now a level-three warrior.

87
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:10,100
What's going on? leonard,  guess what?

88
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:12,130
I'm a level-three warrior.

89
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:13,960
Great.

90
00:05:14,030 --> 00:05:16,030
Do you know there are groceries outside of your apartment?

91
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:18,100
Yeah, yeah, yeah. shh.

92
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:20,560
I only bring it up because your ice cream's melting

93
00:05:20,630 --> 00:05:22,760
And it's starting to attract wildlife.

94
00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:24,100
Uh-huh, yeah.

95
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,930
Do I stay in the jungle or go towards the beach?

96
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,200
It doesn't matter-- right now; you're looking for treasure.

97
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:32,460
Wait, wait, where are you going?

98
00:05:32,530 --> 00:05:34,200
No, no. you're okay.

99
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:36,260
If you run into crocodiles, just kick them with your boots.

100
00:05:39,730 --> 00:05:41,960
You want to catch me up?

101
00:05:42,030 --> 00:05:43,500
Well, let's see, uh,

102
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:46,330
She attempted to open her apartment with her car key

103
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:49,660
Because her face is overly midwestern, um...

104
00:05:49,730 --> 00:05:52,460
She hasn't had sex in six months...

105
00:05:52,530 --> 00:05:55,230
And she ate a fly.

106
00:05:58,730 --> 00:06:00,560
Seriously?  six months?

107
00:06:00,630 --> 00:06:01,900
Oh, my god!

108
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:03,500
A treasure chest! I'm rich!

109
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:07,360
Level three, and she thinks she's rich.

110
00:06:10,130 --> 00:06:12,560
What a newb.

111
00:06:13,930 --> 00:06:15,860
Okay...

112
00:06:15,930 --> 00:06:17,300
We're all set.

113
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:19,430
Let her rip.

114
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:33,930
Hi.

115
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,560
Check it out-- it's just   corn starch and water.

116
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:40,460
They make up

117
00:06:40,530 --> 00:06:42,600
A non-newtonian fluid, which is liquid,

118
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:46,030
But solid under the percussive action of the speaker.

119
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:49,100
That's what makes it get all funky.

120
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:52,530
Yeah. okay.

121
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:55,130
Uh, listen, I need to talk to sheldon.

122
00:06:59,430 --> 00:07:02,100
No, that's what she said-- sheldon.

123
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:04,130
Okay, I'm in the game,

124
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:06,200
And I've been exploring the island of tortage,

125
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:08,260
But I can't figure out how to get past the guard captain.

126
00:07:08,330 --> 00:07:09,600
Do you have the enchanted sword?

127
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:11,160
No, no, I have a bronze dagger.

128
00:07:11,230 --> 00:07:13,430
You can't slay the guard captain with a bronze dagger.

129
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:15,000
My lord, it's like the car key

130
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:16,560
In your apartment door all over again.

131
00:07:16,630 --> 00:07:17,960
All right, how do I get the sword?

132
00:07:18,030 --> 00:07:19,530
Well, have you been to the temple of mishra?

133
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:21,030
Is that the place on the hill with

134
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:22,960
-The weird priest in front of it? -no, no, no, it's...

135
00:07:23,030 --> 00:07:24,300
Oh, for god's sakes, gimme.

136
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:25,630
Thank you-- I really appreciate this.

137
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:27,000
You're gonna have to learn

138
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:28,230
To do these things for yourself, penny.

139
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:29,800
Don't patronize me-- just get the sword!

140
00:07:32,630 --> 00:07:34,830
What the frack?

141
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:36,660
Beats me.

142
00:07:36,730 --> 00:07:38,830
They were playing all last night, too.

143
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:42,000
It's like some kind of weird comic book crossover.

144
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:45,360
Like if hulk were dating peppermint patty.

145
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:48,000
I always thought peppermint patty was a lesbian.

146
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:50,000
No, that's marcie.

147
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:53,260
Peppermint patty's just athletic.

148
00:07:53,330 --> 00:07:54,930
There you go-- one enchanted sword.

149
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,260
All right, gimme, gimme, gimme.

150
00:07:56,330 --> 00:07:59,160
I want to kill the guard captain.

151
00:08:00,333 --> 00:08:05,260
That girl needs to get a life.

152
00:08:17,030 --> 00:08:18,800
Sheldon?

153
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:26,530
Sheldon...

154
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:29,160
Danger! danger!

155
00:08:29,230 --> 00:08:30,760
No danger--  it's just me, penny.

156
00:08:30,830 --> 00:08:31,530
Listen, I got to level 25

157
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:33,360
And reached purple lotus swamp, right?

158
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:35,630
You're in my bedroom.

159
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:38,060
Leonard gave me an emergency key.

160
00:08:38,130 --> 00:08:39,400
People can't be in my bedroom.

161
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:41,500
Well, can we go talk in the living room?

162
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:43,730
I'm not wearing pajama bottoms.

163
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:45,660
Why not?

164
00:08:45,730 --> 00:08:47,500
I spilled grape juice.

165
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:50,430
Well, wear different pajamas.

166
00:08:50,430 --> 00:08:53,500
I can't wear different pajamas--  these are my monday pajamas.

167
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:55,330
Penny, people cannot be in my bedroom.

168
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:57,160
Okay, fine, just tell me, is it too soon

169
00:08:57,230 --> 00:09:00,160
To join a quest to the black castle?

170
00:09:00,230 --> 00:09:01,630
-You were invited on a quest to the black castle? -yeah, yeah.

171
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:04,560
By some guys in budapest.

172
00:09:04,630 --> 00:09:06,530
I'm just not sure it's the right move for my character.

173
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:07,500
Of course it's not--   you're only

174
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:08,800
A level 25.

175
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:10,160
These hungarians,

176
00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:13,600
They're just using you for dragon fodder.

177
00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:15,260
Really? boy, you'd think you could trust

178
00:09:15,330 --> 00:09:18,560
A horde of hungarian barbarians.

179
00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:20,360
Please, penny, enough.

180
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:23,860
I have to sleep.

181
00:09:23,930 --> 00:09:25,730
Okay, well, you were great.

182
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:30,200
Thanks.

183
00:09:30,260 --> 00:09:31,330
Oh. hey, leonard. listen,  don't go in sheldon's room--

184
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:34,730
He's not wearing bottoms.

185
00:09:39,830 --> 00:09:43,260
Sheldon, you want  to catch me up again?

186
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:48,000
People, I am very busy today.

187
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:50,500
I realize that, dr. gablehauser,

188
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:52,460
But it is your job, as  head of the department,

189
00:09:52,530 --> 00:09:53,860
To mediate all interdepartmental disputes.

190
00:09:53,930 --> 00:09:55,200
University policy manual,

191
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:57,530
Chapter Four, Subsection Two:

192
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:00,030
"mediation of interdepartmental disputes."

193
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:02,060
Fine.

194
00:10:02,130 --> 00:10:04,230
Dr. winkle, what colorful name

195
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:06,650
Did you call dr. cooper this time?

196
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:09,400
Dr. dumb-ass.

197
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:12,430
Dr. cooper, dr. winkle apologizes.

198
00:10:12,430 --> 00:10:13,400
No, I don't. no, she doesn't.

199
00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:16,660
Here's the problem.

200
00:10:16,730 --> 00:10:18,530
I was clearly signed up

201
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:19,930
To use the mainframe in buckman 204,

202
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,630
And dr. winkle just wantonly

203
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:23,100
Ripped the sign-up sheet off the wall.

204
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:25,200
It wasn't even an official sign-up sheet.

205
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:26,900
He printed it himself, and he put his name down

206
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,430
On every slot for the next six months.

207
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:30,660
If it is a crime

208
00:10:30,730 --> 00:10:33,760
To ensure that the university's resources

209
00:10:33,830 --> 00:10:35,460
Are not being squandered chasing subatomic wild geese,

210
00:10:35,530 --> 00:10:38,630
Then I plead guilty.

211
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:41,400
Oh, penny!  do you need

212
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:43,560
To get that, dr. cooper?

213
00:10:43,630 --> 00:10:45,800
-God, no. -Well, don't turn it off,

214
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:47,260
You might miss your call from the nobel committee

215
00:10:47,330 --> 00:10:49,560
Letting you know you've been nominated

216
00:10:49,630 --> 00:10:51,860
As dumb-ass laureate of the year.

217
00:10:51,930 --> 00:10:54,160
Oh, yeah? well...

218
00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:56,900
You wouldn't even be nominated.

219
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:01,900
Dr. gablehauser,  I have a series

220
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:04,830
Of important calculations  and simulations to run.

221
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:06,430
All she's doing is reducing irrelevant data

222
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:07,700
And making a mock...

223
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:09,030
Excuse me.

224
00:11:09,030 --> 00:11:10,580
Gablehauser.

225
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:13,540
It's for you.

226
00:11:16,570 --> 00:11:17,960
Hello?

227
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:20,490
Penny, this is not a good time.

228
00:11:21,650 --> 00:11:22,560
No, I told you,

229
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:24,720
You're not prepared for the sanctum of burning souls.

230
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:28,960
You need to be in a group of at least five for that quest

231
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:30,620
And one should be a level 35 healer.

232
00:11:31,470 --> 00:11:33,070
Penny, I can't log on and help you.

233
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:35,810
We'll talk when I get home.

234
00:11:42,050 --> 00:11:44,300
I'm not getting the computing time, am i?

235
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:46,260
Dumb-ass.

236
00:11:50,490 --> 00:11:53,390
Leonard, you have to do something about penny.

237
00:11:53,390 --> 00:11:54,850
She is interfering with my sleep,

238
00:11:54,850 --> 00:11:56,260
She's interfering with my work,

239
00:11:56,260 --> 00:11:59,030
And if I had another significant aspect of my life,

240
00:11:59,030 --> 00:12:00,690
I'm sure she'd be interfering with that, too.

241
00:12:02,810 --> 00:12:04,510
Why should I do something?

242
00:12:04,510 --> 00:12:07,040
You're the one who introduced  her to online gaming. yes,

243
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:09,600
But you're the one who said hello to her when she moved in.

244
00:12:11,210 --> 00:12:12,540
If you'd simply restrained yourself,

245
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:13,760
None of this would be happening.

246
00:12:15,170 --> 00:12:16,690
Why don't you just tell her to leave you alone?

247
00:12:16,690 --> 00:12:18,420
I did, I told her,

248
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:21,050
I texted her, I sent out a very emphatic twitter.

249
00:12:21,050 --> 00:12:23,070
I even changed my facebook status to

250
00:12:23,070 --> 00:12:25,330
"sheldon cooper wishes penny would leave him alone."

251
00:12:25,330 --> 00:12:26,430
I don't know what else to do.

252
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:29,730
Well, what am I supposed to do?

253
00:12:29,730 --> 00:12:31,690
I don't know, but if you don't figure something out,

254
00:12:31,690 --> 00:12:34,840
I warn you, I shall become very difficult to live with.

255
00:12:36,650 --> 00:12:39,260
You mean up until now we've been experiencing

256
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:40,790
The happy, fun-time Sheldon?

257
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:43,710
Yes. I'll go talk to her.

258
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:47,540
No, fritz, I need you on my flank.

259
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,160
No, I don't know german.

260
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:51,530
Flankenzei, flankenzei.

261
00:12:55,030 --> 00:12:56,580
Hey, Penny.Busy.

262
00:12:57,670 --> 00:12:58,710
Yeah, I see that.

263
00:12:58,710 --> 00:13:00,130
Shouldn't you be at work?

264
00:13:00,130 --> 00:13:01,200
I don't work on mondays.

265
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:03,140
It's thursday.

266
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:07,150
Listen, Penny...

267
00:13:07,150 --> 00:13:08,260
Queen penelope, afk.

268
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:09,550
What...?

269
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:15,780
Here's the thing.

270
00:13:15,780 --> 00:13:18,980
Sometimes people, good people,

271
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:20,420
Yeah, they start playing these games

272
00:13:20,420 --> 00:13:21,100
And they find themselves--

273
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:22,910
Through no fault of their own--

274
00:13:22,910 --> 00:13:25,020
You know, kind of...addicted.

275
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:27,650
Yeah, get to the point.I'm about to level up here.

276
00:13:27,650 --> 00:13:29,550
It's just if a person doesn't have

277
00:13:29,550 --> 00:13:31,350
A sense of achievement in their real life,

278
00:13:31,350 --> 00:13:33,240
It's easy to lose themselves in a virtual world

279
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:35,380
Where they can get a false sense of accomplishment.

280
00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:36,820
Yeah, jabber, jabber, jabber.okay, boys,

281
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:38,110
Queen penelope's back online.

282
00:13:40,070 --> 00:13:42,320
Penny, you've got...

283
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:44,620
Cheetos in your hair.

284
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:47,030
Oh. thanks.

285
00:13:59,690 --> 00:14:01,980
Hey, Penny, it's me again, Leonard.

286
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:04,810
Leonard, I said not now.

287
00:14:04,810 --> 00:14:06,990
I know, I'm just a little concerned about you.

288
00:14:06,990 --> 00:14:08,270
I said not now!

289
00:14:08,270 --> 00:14:09,770
Okay, maybe later.

290
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:13,330
Hey, guys.

291
00:14:14,850 --> 00:14:15,650
Hey, what's with him?

292
00:14:15,650 --> 00:14:17,650
Penny's been keeping him up at night.

293
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:20,950
Me, too.

294
00:14:24,770 --> 00:14:27,230
But probably in a different way.

295
00:14:28,010 --> 00:14:29,840
She's gotten really hooked on age of conan.

296
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:31,070
She's playing nonstop.

297
00:14:31,070 --> 00:14:33,100
Ah, yes, online gaming addiction.

298
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:34,310
There's nothing worse than having

299
00:14:34,310 --> 00:14:37,030
That multi-player monkey on your back.

300
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:39,680
Sheldon, wake up!

301
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:41,140
Danger! danger!

302
00:14:42,990 --> 00:14:44,290
Afternoon, men.

303
00:14:44,290 --> 00:14:45,800
Sheldon.

304
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:48,160
Oh, yeah?

305
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:49,700
Well, your attempt at juvenilizing me

306
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:52,040
By excluding me from the set of adult males, just...

307
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:54,590
Oh, I'm too tired to do this.

308
00:14:56,060 --> 00:14:57,550
Right.I heard you've been pulling all-nighters

309
00:14:57,550 --> 00:14:58,550
With middle earth barbie.

310
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:01,550
She comes into my room.

311
00:15:01,550 --> 00:15:03,320
No one's supposed to be in my room.

312
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:07,430
I would postulate that she's escaping into the online world

313
00:15:07,430 --> 00:15:09,410
To compensate for her sexual frustration.

314
00:15:09,410 --> 00:15:10,490
I do that, too.

315
00:15:12,810 --> 00:15:15,280
But probably in a different way.

316
00:15:16,990 --> 00:15:18,940
That's not what she's doing, Leslie.

317
00:15:18,940 --> 00:15:21,110
She's just trying to shore up her self-esteem.

318
00:15:21,110 --> 00:15:22,340
It has nothing to do with sex.

319
00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:23,830
Everything has to do with sex.

320
00:15:23,830 --> 00:15:26,120
Mm, testify.

321
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:29,290
I'm not touching that.

322
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:34,230
Leslie, you are way off base here.

323
00:15:34,230 --> 00:15:35,190
Hang on, leonard.

324
00:15:35,190 --> 00:15:37,660
While I have no respect for Leslie as a scientist

325
00:15:37,660 --> 00:15:39,340
Or a human being,for that matter,

326
00:15:39,340 --> 00:15:41,410
We have to

327
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:45,430
Concede her undeniable expertise in the interrelated fields

328
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:47,360
Of promiscuity and general sluttiness.

329
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:51,300
Thank you.

330
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:53,000
My point is that tinker bell just needs to get her some.

331
00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:54,200
Some what?

332
00:15:54,260 --> 00:15:56,060
Oh, yes, some sexual intercourse.

333
00:15:58,830 --> 00:16:00,800
I'll take the bullet.

334
00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:04,860
Excuse me, this whole idea is insane.

335
00:16:04,930 --> 00:16:06,930
Enough debate, I'm going to take action.

336
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,400
Excuse me.

337
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:13,530
Are you currently involved in a sexual relationship?

338
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:14,900
No.

339
00:16:15,430 --> 00:16:17,700
Would you like to be?

340
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:21,700
Uh... sure, why not?

341
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:22,760
Sheldon...

342
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:25,730
Puh-puh-puh.

343
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:31,030
Can I have your phone number?

344
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:32,500
Uh... yeah.

345
00:16:43,130 --> 00:16:44,260
There. problem solved.

346
00:16:48,860 --> 00:16:50,600
Dumb-ass.

347
00:16:58,060 --> 00:16:59,100
Okay, I'm at the gate to the treasury of the ancients.

348
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:00,230
I'm going in.

349
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:01,900
Stay close to the wall.

350
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:04,600
Avoid the mummies. got it.

351
00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:07,530
I must say you're playing very well for a woman of 23.

352
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:08,630
Twenty-two.

353
00:17:08,730 --> 00:17:10,230
Right, 22.

355
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:14,930
Oh, here come the mummies.

356
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,300
Which spell do I use, the hateful strike

357
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:17,630
Or the frenzy stance?

358
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:19,460
What happened to the rest of your group?

359
00:17:19,530 --> 00:17:22,430
I dumped them, they're a bunch of wussies.

360
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:25,060
Frenzy stance.

361
00:17:25,123 --> 00:17:26,123
Frenzy, frenzy, frenzy, frenzy, frenzy.

362
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:30,900
So, listen, would you describe your ideal vacation

363
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:34,100
As a wild adventure to unknown lands

364
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:36,530
Or staying at home curled up with a good book?

365
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:38,200
What?

366
00:17:38,260 --> 00:17:40,960
These are market research questions.

367
00:17:41,030 --> 00:17:42,800
I'm filling out the online registration for your game.

368
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:44,900
Oh, okay, wild adventure.

369
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:46,860
Oh, frenzy stance isn't working.

370
00:17:46,930 --> 00:17:48,130
Die, you undead mummy, die!

371
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:49,300
Drink a healing potion.

372
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:51,130
Thank you. you're welcome.

373
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:56,630
Anyhow, on a scale of one to five,

374
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:59,230
With one being always initiated by him

375
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:02,730
And five being always initiated by you,

376
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:04,700
How do you prefer your sexual encounters to begin?

377
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:06,500
That's on the registration?

378
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:08,260
Oh, yes, it's quite extensive.

379
00:18:08,330 --> 00:18:09,600
But if we complete it,

380
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:11,460
You get a free expansion pack.

381
00:18:11,530 --> 00:18:13,260
75 additional quests.

382
00:18:13,330 --> 00:18:14,930
Ooh, awesome, okay, I totally like to initiate.

383
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,460
I'm a big ol' five.

384
00:18:16,530 --> 00:18:18,900
Good to know.

385
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,159
Big ol' five.

386
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:30,830
Hello.

387
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:32,110
Hi.

388
00:18:32,130 --> 00:18:34,200
Leonard, this is tom.

389
00:18:38,330 --> 00:18:39,900
Hi, tom.   sheldon...

390
00:18:43,460 --> 00:18:46,130
Didn't I explain to you

391
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:47,200
About your little mistake in the cafeteria?

392
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:48,260
Yes,

393
00:18:48,330 --> 00:18:50,060
You were very clear.

394
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:53,460
As was everyone else at the table.

395
00:18:53,530 --> 00:18:55,860
Tom, however, has been chosen by science

396
00:18:55,930 --> 00:18:57,400
As a suitable mate for penny.

397
00:18:57,460 --> 00:19:00,000
Chosen by science?

398
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:03,030
Well, what passes for science on dating sites.

399
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:05,630
They claim to use heuristic algorithms,

400
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:08,260
But it may well be hokum.

401
00:19:08,330 --> 00:19:09,660
You got penny to sign up for online dating?

402
00:19:09,730 --> 00:19:11,830
No, of course not.

403
00:19:12,030 --> 00:19:15,760
See, I used trickery and deceit.

404
00:19:15,830 --> 00:19:18,100
This is bad.

405
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:19,630
Tom is a paramedic with the fire department,

406
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:21,400
But he's going to med school at night.

407
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:24,600
He likes the outdoors

408
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:28,060
And, uh, strong women who initiate sex.

409
00:19:28,130 --> 00:19:30,630
Really, really bad.

410
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:33,100
I'm surprised you struck out with penny.

411
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:36,360
Apparently, she's a big ol' five.

412
00:19:36,430 --> 00:19:37,400
Sheldon, what do you want?

413
00:19:37,460 --> 00:19:38,430
Oh, good,

414
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:39,900
You got my note.

415
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:41,230
Penny, I'd like you to meet tom.

416
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:42,700
Penny, this is tom.

417
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:43,860
Tom, may I present penny.

418
00:19:43,930 --> 00:19:44,800
Hi, penny.

419
00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:46,200
Yeah, hey. listen...

420
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:47,430
As long as I'm here,

421
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:48,330
I'm on a quest with a bunch of newbs.

422
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:49,430
They don't know what they're doing.

423
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:50,530
We've got one assassin,

424
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:51,730
Three spell casters and no tank.

425
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:52,960
Can we talk about this later?

426
00:19:53,030 --> 00:19:55,300
No, no, no, no. I need you now.

427
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:56,360
Wouldn't you prefer to socialize with tom,

428
00:19:56,830 --> 00:19:59,230
Who is a sexually passive outdoorsman?

429
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:02,660
Whatever. I'll figure it out myself.

430
00:20:04,330 --> 00:20:07,300
Bye, penny.

431
00:20:07,330 --> 00:20:11,700
I'm sorry, dude, she didn't look anything like her picture.

432
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:13,060
They never do

433
00:20:19,730 --> 00:20:21,020
hello, fair penny.

434
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:22,300
Who are you?

435
00:20:22,530 --> 00:20:24,200
It is i, sir howard of wolowitz.

436
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:29,320
Can I interest you in an afternoon of spirited questing

437
00:20:29,630 --> 00:20:31,840
Followed by a flagon of ale at yon virtual tavern?

438
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:34,550
Yeah, sure, why not?

439
00:20:38,030 --> 00:20:38,990
Oh, my god, I need help.
