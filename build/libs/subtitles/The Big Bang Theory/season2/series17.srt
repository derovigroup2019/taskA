...hand me the number six

Stop.

00:00:10,026 --> 00:00:11,823
We can't do this. It's not right.

5
00:00:11,995 --> 00:00:13,622
Sheldon, you have got two choices.

6
00:00:13,797 --> 00:00:17,358
Put a bigger hard drive in the TiVo
or delete stuff before we go out of town.

7
00:00:17,534 --> 00:00:20,435
But once you open the box,
you've voided the warranty.

8
00:00:21,137 --> 00:00:25,039
The warranty is a sacred covenant
we've entered into with the manufacturer.

9
00:00:25,208 --> 00:00:26,869
He offers to stand by his equipment.

10
00:00:27,043 --> 00:00:30,604
We in return agree not to violate
the integrity of the internal hardware.

11
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:35,717
This little orange sticker is all that stands
between us and anarchy.

12
00:00:37,053 --> 00:00:38,918
Okay,
then we won't touch the hard drive.

13
00:00:39,089 --> 00:00:41,819
We'll just erase the first season
of <i>Battlestar.</i>

00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:45,552
There. We're outlaws.

15
00:00:47,464 --> 00:00:50,991
- Here you go, Leonard. Is this big enough?
- It's perfect.

16
00:00:53,336 --> 00:00:57,466
For taking daffodils to your unicorn.

17
00:00:57,841 --> 00:01:00,036
It's just for my notebooks.
Thanks, Penny.

18
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:02,804
I love San Francisco.
I wish I was going with you.

19
00:01:02,979 --> 00:01:04,173
I understand your envy.

20
00:01:04,347 --> 00:01:06,372
This is a can't-miss symposium.

21
00:01:06,549 --> 00:01:10,178
There are going to be discussions
on bioorganic cellular computer devices...

22
00:01:10,353 --> 00:01:12,787
...advancements
in multi-threaded task completion...

23
00:01:12,956 --> 00:01:16,585
...plus a round table on the non-equilibrium
Green's Function approach...

24
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:18,990
...to the photoionization process
in atoms.

25
00:01:20,096 --> 00:01:23,725
When I go, I usually just get hammered
and ride the cable cars.

26
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:25,761
This conference is a big thing.

27
00:01:25,935 --> 00:01:28,335
The keynote address
is delivered by George Smoot.

28
00:01:28,772 --> 00:01:30,672
Oh, my God. The George Smoot?

29
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:33,673
- You've heard of him?
- Of course I haven't.

30
00:01:34,878 --> 00:01:37,540
George Smoot
is a Nobel Prize-winning physicist...

31
00:01:37,714 --> 00:01:39,579
...one of the great minds of our time.

32
00:01:39,749 --> 00:01:41,273
His work in black body form...

33
00:01:41,451 --> 00:01:44,443
...and anisotropy of the cosmic
microwave background radiation...

34
00:01:44,621 --> 00:01:47,920
...cemented our understanding
of the origin of the universe.

35
00:01:48,091 --> 00:01:49,786
It's kind of a funny name though.

36
00:01:49,959 --> 00:01:51,950
Smoot.

37
00:01:54,798 --> 00:01:56,425
It's like talking to a chimp.

38
00:01:58,067 --> 00:02:01,195
Okay, now that I've been completely
insulted, have a good flight.

39
00:02:01,371 --> 00:02:04,465
- Yeah, I wish.
- We're not flying. We're taking the train.

40
00:02:04,641 --> 00:02:05,733
Oh, cool.

41
00:02:05,909 --> 00:02:10,608
Yeah, cool. Seven times as long as flying
and costs almost twice as much.

42
00:02:11,981 --> 00:02:14,449
- Well then why are you doing it?
- Well, we had a vote.

43
00:02:14,617 --> 00:02:17,051
Three voted for airplane,
Sheldon voted for train.

44
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:19,688
So we're taking the train.

45
00:02:20,490 --> 00:02:24,893
Don't say it like that, Leonard.
Say it like, "We're taking the train!"

52
00:03:01,598 --> 00:03:03,862
I'm simplifying the task of packing
for our trip.

00:03:04,033 --> 00:03:06,092
See, by attaching RFID tags
to my clothing...

54
00:03:06,269 --> 00:03:10,205
...it will enable my laptop to read
and identify the items with this wand.

55
00:03:10,373 --> 00:03:14,036
Then cross-reference them against
destination, anticipated activity spectrum...

56
00:03:14,210 --> 00:03:17,111
...weather conditions,
duration of trip, etc.

57
00:03:20,550 --> 00:03:22,575
Well, that does sound much simpler.

How long is this gonna take?

59
00:03:25,855 --> 00:03:28,517
Assuming I can keep up this pace,
three hours 11 minutes.

this fairly pointless conversation.

Wow.

62
00:03:34,964 --> 00:03:38,195
Teasing the guys at the Apple store
seems a little redundant now.

way to infiltrate and destroy mankind...

00:09:16,105 --> 00:09:18,938
It's brilliant. He needs to read it.

168
00:09:19,842 --> 00:09:21,935
So you'll send him an email
when we get back.

169
00:09:22,111 --> 00:09:25,205
Then I won't get to see
his face light up as he reads it.

170
00:09:25,381 --> 00:09:28,214
- Right. Of course.
- Oh, this is an unmitigated disaster.

171
00:09:28,384 --> 00:09:31,080
Well, there's nothing you can do about it,
so relax.

172
00:09:31,254 --> 00:09:35,623
Sit back, enjoy the clickety-clack
of the steel wheels on the polished rails.

It's hot in here. Must be Summer.

179
00:10:16,198 --> 00:10:19,224
So, where you gals headed?

180
00:10:19,769 --> 00:10:21,862
Okay, I've found the perfect solution.

181
00:10:22,038 --> 00:10:24,268
We get off the train at the next stop
in Oxnard.

182
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:27,773
We then take the 1:13 train
back to Union Station.

183
00:10:27,943 --> 00:10:30,036
We take a cab back,
get my flash drive...

184
00:10:30,212 --> 00:10:34,342
...and race to San Luis Obispo, assuming
the lights are with us, minimal traffic...

185
00:10:34,517 --> 00:10:35,882
...we'll meet the train.

186
00:10:36,052 --> 00:10:39,613
- I've got a better idea.
- Are you going to be sarcastic?

187
00:10:39,789 --> 00:10:42,883
Boy, you take all the fun out of it for me.

188
00:10:43,059 --> 00:10:44,151
But, look, Penny's home.

189
00:10:44,327 --> 00:10:48,127
Why don't we call her, have her get
your flash drive and e-mail you the paper?

190
00:10:48,297 --> 00:10:50,788
But the flash drive
is in a locked drawer in my desk.

191
00:10:50,966 --> 00:10:53,127
- So?
- The key is hidden in my room.

192
00:10:53,302 --> 00:10:55,167
- So?
- Penny'd have to go into my room.

193
00:10:55,338 --> 00:10:57,806
- So?
- People don't go in my room.

194
00:10:58,641 --> 00:11:00,575
I see. Well, it seems once again...

195
00:11:00,743 --> 00:11:04,076
...you're caught
between a rock and a crazy place.

196
00:11:05,848 --> 00:11:07,509
Oh, I hate when that happens.

It's hot in here. Must be summer.

It's hot in here. Must be Summer.

200
00:11:19,095 --> 00:11:21,723
- That's cute.
- Really? I just made it up.

201
00:11:23,666 --> 00:11:26,032
Have you seen <i>Slumdog Millionaire?</i>

202
00:11:26,736 --> 00:11:27,896
Oh yeah, I loved it.

203
00:11:28,070 --> 00:11:29,901
It's loosely based on my life.

204
00:11:33,476 --> 00:11:36,741
We're putting the play on for one night
in this little 99-seat theater.

205
00:11:36,912 --> 00:11:39,005
Can you come? Oh, great.

206
00:11:39,181 --> 00:11:42,309
Do you know 98 other people
that might wanna come?

207
00:11:42,718 --> 00:11:44,845
Oh, hang on. Hello?

208
00:11:45,020 --> 00:11:47,488
Listen. I'm about to give you
a set of instructions...

209
00:11:47,656 --> 00:11:49,556
...which you must follow to the letter.

210
00:11:49,725 --> 00:11:50,953
Just a sec.

211
00:11:51,127 --> 00:11:53,755
Theater's above a bowling alley
so it's a little noisy...

212
00:11:53,929 --> 00:11:57,831
...but it might be the only chance
I'll ever get to play Anne Frank.

213
00:11:58,634 --> 00:12:00,067
And the director is brilliant.

214
00:12:00,236 --> 00:12:03,637
He uses the bowling sounds
as, like, Nazi artillery.

215
00:12:03,806 --> 00:12:05,797
Okay, great, I'll see you then.

It's Sheldon.

PENNY: Oh, hey, Sheldon.
How's San Francisco?

221

I'm not in San Francisco. I'm on a tra--
Were you even listening to me?

- No, I was talking to my friend. What's up?
- What's up? I'll tell you what's up.

...I need you to marshal your powers

Hi, Penny, it's Leonard.

Hey, Leonard, what's going on
with Dr. Wackadoodle?

228
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:44,206
He's calling to ask you a favor.
You might be confused...

229
00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:48,248
...because he didn't use the words "Penny,"
"Sheldon," "please" or "favor."

230
00:12:48,417 --> 00:12:50,681
Okay. Enough chitchat.

231
00:12:51,153 --> 00:12:54,486
Okay, step one: Locate your emergency key
to our apartment.

robots cannot get here soon enough.

And that bright little star
peeking her head out early today...

238
00:13:17,112 --> 00:13:19,103
...that's Venus.

That is so cool.

00:13:21,383 --> 00:13:22,782
You know a lot about space.

241
00:13:23,219 --> 00:13:29,124
Come on. When you were on TV in <i>Firefly,</i>
you were actually in space.

242
00:13:29,758 --> 00:13:31,851
You're not one of those guys
who believe that?

243
00:13:32,495 --> 00:13:35,794
You mean one of the hopeless geeks?
No.

Now him, he's one of those geeks.

248
00:13:53,215 --> 00:13:55,775
All right, now before you enter
my bedroom unescorted...

249
00:13:55,951 --> 00:13:59,079
...I need you to understand
that this one time grant of access...

250
00:13:59,255 --> 00:14:02,383
...does not create a permanent easement.

251
00:14:03,092 --> 00:14:04,218
Easement.

252
00:14:05,761 --> 00:14:08,889
It's a legal right of access. Good grief.

Do you believe him?

255
00:14:17,606 --> 00:14:21,906
Normally around women,
he has the personality of a boiled potato.

256
00:14:22,077 --> 00:14:25,342
Put one beer in him,
and he's M. Knight Charmalarmalon.

257
00:14:28,984 --> 00:14:31,384
Is that what he's drinking?
It's not even real beer.

258
00:14:31,554 --> 00:14:32,748
- What?
- Look at it.

259
00:14:33,522 --> 00:14:35,820
Non-alcoholic beer.

- Then what's going on?
- I don't know.

261

Some sort of placebo effect, I guess.

Placebo, you say.

263
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,825

Yes, I'm still here.
Where am I going? I'm on a train.

00:14:49,772 --> 00:14:53,299
Now, what you'll be looking for
is a small wooden box...

266
00:14:53,475 --> 00:14:58,742
...located between a Hoberman Sphere
and a sample of quartz flecked with pyrite.

267
00:14:58,914 --> 00:15:00,506
Hoberman Sphere.

268
00:15:00,683 --> 00:15:04,175
It's a collapsible icosidodecahedron.

269
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:09,550
No, the thing with the time on it
is my alarm clock. <i>My God.</i>

Actually, in India,
the names of constellations are different.

Where you have the Big Dipper,
we have the Big Curry Pot.

00:15:19,969 --> 00:15:21,163
You're making that up.

273
00:15:21,770 --> 00:15:23,431
You got me.

274
00:15:23,606 --> 00:15:25,938

- Raj. Look.
- Yes?

276
00:15:32,314 --> 00:15:34,179
- What am I looking at?
- You tell me.

00:15:34,783 --> 00:15:37,411

Hi. I'm the small package
good things come in.

279
00:15:51,934 --> 00:15:55,597
Okay, I got a box, but there's no key
in here. Just letters.

280
00:15:55,771 --> 00:15:57,363
That's the wrong box. Put it back.

281
00:15:57,539 --> 00:16:00,303
Oh, Sheldon, are these letters
from your grandmother?

282

That is so cute.

Hey, Leonard. How's the train ride?

287
00:16:13,856 --> 00:16:17,314
Delightful. I don't know
what you're doing right now...

288
00:16:17,493 --> 00:16:20,894
...but there are little bubbles forming
in the corner of Sheldon's mouth.

289
00:16:21,063 --> 00:16:23,964
Okay. Yeah, I kind of crossed a line.
Put him back on.

00:16:24,133 --> 00:16:25,361
Thank you.

291
00:16:26,735 --> 00:16:29,465
- I'm back.
- What up, Moon Pie?

292
00:16:30,039 --> 00:16:33,406
No one calls me Moon Pie but Meemaw.

00:16:35,110 --> 00:16:37,374
Hey, Penny. Leonard again.

294
00:16:39,014 --> 00:16:42,472
So anyway, in the dream, you and I
were ice skating, just the two of us.

295
00:16:42,651 --> 00:16:44,846
And then I picked you up
by your ankles...

296
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:49,480
...and twirled you round and round
until your legs tore off.

297
00:16:51,427 --> 00:16:55,056
I mean, I tried to stick them back on,
but before I could...

298
00:16:55,230 --> 00:16:59,929
...you turned into a giant loaf
of pumpernickel bread.

299
00:17:00,102 --> 00:17:01,569
What do you think that means?

300
00:17:02,971 --> 00:17:05,235
I really don't know.

301
00:17:06,442 --> 00:17:07,807
I'll give you a little clue.

302
00:17:07,976 --> 00:17:11,412
My favorite sandwich?
Salami on pumpernickel.

303
00:17:12,314 --> 00:17:13,440
Is that so?

304
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:18,250
Did you know the word pumpernickel comes
from the German words <i>pumper</i> and <i>knickel.</i>

305
00:17:18,420 --> 00:17:20,752
Which loosely translates to fart goblin?

306
00:17:22,624 --> 00:17:25,559
No. I didn't.

307
00:17:28,430 --> 00:17:30,364
Okay, I found the box. Now what?

308
00:17:30,532 --> 00:17:36,027
You're holding a Japanese puzzle box,
which takes 10 precise moves to open.

309
00:17:36,205 --> 00:17:39,436
Okay, first locate the
panel with the diamond pattern...

310
00:17:39,608 --> 00:17:43,305
...and slide the center portion
1 millimeter to the left.

311
00:17:43,479 --> 00:17:45,572
Then, on the opposite end of the box...

312
00:17:45,748 --> 00:17:48,842
...slide the entire panel
down 2 millimeters.

313
00:17:49,017 --> 00:17:50,882
You'll hear a slight click.

314
00:17:51,053 --> 00:17:54,716
Hang on. Sheldon, do you have
any emotional attachment to this box?

315
00:17:54,890 --> 00:17:58,291
No. It's a novelty I ordered off the Internet.
Did you hear the click?

316
00:17:58,460 --> 00:18:00,087
Not yet.

317
00:18:03,398 --> 00:18:05,161
There it is.

318
00:18:08,637 --> 00:18:10,070
Okay, here's another one.

319
00:18:10,239 --> 00:18:14,266
If you married the famous rock guitarist
Johnny Winter...

320
00:18:14,443 --> 00:18:16,741
...you'd be Summer Winter.

321
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:20,573
- Uh-huh.
- Yep.

322
00:18:21,016 --> 00:18:25,715
Okay, I'm gonna just go for broke here
and say I like you.

Yeah?

324
00:18:27,956 --> 00:18:29,446
So here's my question:

325
00:18:29,625 --> 00:18:33,925
Do you see any conversational path that
would take us from where we are now...

326
00:18:34,096 --> 00:18:36,826
...to a place where I could ask you out
and you'd say yes?

327
00:18:38,567 --> 00:18:40,034
No.

328
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:44,202
Fair enough. I'll leave you in peace.

329
00:18:44,373 --> 00:18:46,000
Thank you.

330
00:18:48,310 --> 00:18:50,471
But before I go...

331
00:18:51,346 --> 00:18:55,942
...would you mind if I just take one picture
of us together for my Facebook page?

332
00:18:56,118 --> 00:18:57,551
Sure.

333
00:19:06,528 --> 00:19:08,291
Okay. Great.

334
00:19:08,463 --> 00:19:10,897
Can I take one
where it looks like we're making out?

335
00:19:12,467 --> 00:19:19,168
Okay, now you're going to insert
the flash drive into the USB port.

336
00:19:19,341 --> 00:19:20,672
[EXHALES SHARPLY]

337
00:19:22,077 --> 00:19:24,944
She calls me Moon Pie
because I'm nummy-nummy...

338
00:19:25,113 --> 00:19:27,741
...and she could just eat me up.

339
00:19:28,951 --> 00:19:33,513
Now please put the flash drive
in the USB port.

340
00:19:35,224 --> 00:19:38,057
The one that looks like
a little duck's mouth.

341
00:19:40,295 --> 00:19:43,423
- Hey, how'd it go?
- Terminator broke my phone.

342
00:19:49,504 --> 00:19:51,301
Excuse me.

343
00:19:52,808 --> 00:19:54,207
Okay, I'll be honest with you.

344
00:19:54,376 --> 00:19:57,641
I've spent the last two hours imagining
various scenarios in my head...

345
00:19:57,813 --> 00:20:00,338
...trying to come up with some line
to say to you...

346
00:20:00,515 --> 00:20:03,780
...but then I finally realized
you're a human being, I'm a human being.

347
00:20:03,952 --> 00:20:04,976
I could just say--

348
00:20:05,153 --> 00:20:06,177
CONDUCTOR [ON PA]:
<i>Next stop, Santa Barbara.</i>

349
00:20:06,355 --> 00:20:08,414
I'm sorry. This is me.

350
00:20:10,692 --> 00:20:12,990
"Hi, my name's Leonard."

351
00:20:17,666 --> 00:20:21,124
So I'm thinking you won the Nobel Prize,
what, three years ago...

352
00:20:21,303 --> 00:20:24,739
...so you must deal with a whole lot
of "What has Smoot done lately?"

353
00:20:26,475 --> 00:20:29,842
My thought is we continue my research
as a team, you know...

354
00:20:30,012 --> 00:20:31,673
...Cooper-Smoot, alphabetical...

355
00:20:31,847 --> 00:20:36,011
...and when we win the Nobel Prize,
you'll be back on top.

356
00:20:36,652 --> 00:20:39,314
With all due respect, Dr. Cooper,
are you on crack?

357
00:20:43,425 --> 00:20:45,689
Fine. Smoot-Cooper.

358
00:20:45,861 --> 00:20:48,523
Wow, what a diva.
