Fellas, please.

8
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:34,314
Penny, come on.
We were just finding our sound.

9
00:00:34,851 --> 00:00:39,311
You found it. It's the sound of a cat
being run over by a lawn mower.

10
00:00:41,057 --> 00:00:42,684
Well, I'm really very busy.

11
00:00:42,859 --> 00:00:46,158
Is there any way we can put this off
until I have more time to prepare?

12
00:00:46,896 --> 00:00:49,990
Of course,
but, uh, you understand my trepidation.

13
00:00:50,166 --> 00:00:51,724
- What's that about?
- Not a clue.

14
00:00:51,901 --> 00:00:54,369
Can't we just postpone it till the spring?

15
00:00:54,537 --> 00:00:56,061
Maybe next summer?

16
00:00:56,239 --> 00:00:58,002
This should be fairly easy to deduce.

17
00:00:58,174 --> 00:01:01,439
He's holding the phone to his left ear.
Ears do not cross hemispheres.

18
00:01:01,611 --> 00:01:04,808
He's using the analytical,
rather than emotional side of the brain...

19
00:01:04,981 --> 00:01:08,280
...suggesting that he has
no personal relationship with the caller.

20
00:01:08,518 --> 00:01:11,612
No, I didn't realize it had been so long.

21
00:01:11,921 --> 00:01:14,856
Sure. I guess there's no other choice
but to go ahead and do it.

22
00:01:15,024 --> 00:01:17,288
He's referring to an activity
he has done before.

23
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:19,519
It's unpleasant and needs to be repeated.

24
00:01:19,696 --> 00:01:25,100
This suggests some sort of invasive
medical test, like perhaps a colonoscopy.

25
00:01:25,268 --> 00:01:27,930
Aren't there any other options?
There's not a lot of room.

26
00:01:28,104 --> 00:01:30,538
- It's gonna be uncomfortable.
SHELDON: Yes, yes.

27
00:01:30,707 --> 00:01:33,676
I'm definitely going with colonoscopy.

28
00:01:33,843 --> 00:01:35,572
Okay, bye.

29
00:01:38,848 --> 00:01:41,146
My mother's coming to visit.

30
00:01:43,453 --> 00:01:45,785
How about that? You were right.

31
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:18,380
It's out of order.

32
00:02:18,555 --> 00:02:22,889
Yes, I can read the sign.
I'm just pondering the implications.

33
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:27,896
I think it implies
that the elevator doesn't work.

34
00:02:28,965 --> 00:02:30,899
Again, I can read the sign.

35
00:02:31,434 --> 00:02:34,801
But the sign and tape are covered
with a layer of dust which indicates...

36
00:02:34,971 --> 00:02:38,168
...the elevator has been nonfunctional
for an amount of time...

37
00:02:38,341 --> 00:02:41,469
...which suggests either a remarkable
passivity among the...

38
00:02:41,644 --> 00:02:44,807
...I assume 24 to 36 residents
of this building...

39
00:02:44,981 --> 00:02:48,883
...based on the number of mailboxes and
given typical urban population density...

40
00:02:49,052 --> 00:02:52,419
...or a shared delusion of functionality.

41
00:02:53,890 --> 00:02:56,256

00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:19,780
- Yeah, sure, I guess.
- All right, you start.

49
00:03:21,217 --> 00:03:24,414
I've always been curious.
What was Leonard like when he was little?

50
00:03:24,587 --> 00:03:27,954
BEVERLY: Oh, I think you mean young.
He's always been little.

51
00:03:28,391 --> 00:03:30,450
Right.
What was he like when he was young?

52
00:03:30,627 --> 00:03:32,424
You'll have to be more specific.

53
00:03:32,595 --> 00:03:35,826
Oh, um, okay, like five or six.

54
00:03:41,571 --> 00:03:43,801
- Five.
- Oh, well, at that age...

55
00:03:43,973 --> 00:03:48,034
...he was in what Freud would call the
phallic stage of psychosexual development.

56
00:03:48,211 --> 00:03:49,610
An outmoded theory, of course.

57

But the boy did spend most of his waking
hours with a tight grasp on his penis.

you were a psychiatrist.

many who go into the performing arts...

...suffer from an external locus
of identity.

Yeah, I don't know what that means.

Well, it means you value yourself
only as others value you...

68

of unmet childhood emotional needs.

Both selective mutism and an inability
to separate from one's mother...

165
00:10:15,598 --> 00:10:17,862
...can stem from a pathological fear
of women.
