1
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:03,880
That was close.

2
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:08,970
God, I love the smell of
paintballs in the morning.

3
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:12,350
Yeah, still funny, Raj.

4
00:00:14,430 --> 00:00:15,750
There's no way we can get to the ridge.

5
00:00:15,790 --> 00:00:17,900
The Chemistry Department
has us completely cut off.

6
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:19,380
But what about the creek bed?

7
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:24,590
The Pharmacology Department controls that, and
they're all hopped up on experimental steroids.

8
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:26,000
That's it then. We're doomed.

9
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:29,350
I think the time has come to acknowledge
that we are paying the price for some of us

10
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:32,940
failing to attend my Physics
Department paintball strategy meeting.

11
00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:35,640
I told you my mom has spider veins.

12
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:39,070
I had to take her to the laser clinic.

13
00:00:39,650 --> 00:00:43,660
And I told you I wante
to see a doctor's note.

14
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:45,530
We need a plan.

15
00:00:45,580 --> 00:00:47,270
How about Operation Hammer of the Gods?

16
00:00:47,290 --> 00:00:48,850
I forget. Which one
is Hammer of the Gods?

17
00:00:48,860 --> 00:00:53,180
We hide behind the Dumpsters in the parking
lot and ambush people when they come to pee.

18
00:00:54,110 --> 00:00:57,060
No go. The Dumpsters are deep in
Astronomy Department territory.

19
00:00:57,070 --> 00:00:59,020
That shouldn't be a problem.
Venus is up during the day.

20
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:01,550
They're probably just
all staring at the sky.

21
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:04,400
All right, what we need
now is a tactical retreat.

22
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:07,690
Did you see the episode of Stargate
where they found themselves on a planet

23
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:11,390
with a culture based loosely
on Earth's Athens and Sparta?

24
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:14,000
Not important.

25
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:16,620
Leonard, Raj and I are going to
burst out the door and run away.

26
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:18,180
Howard will cover us.

27
00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:20,060
Why don't I run away and you cover me?

28
00:01:20,090 --> 00:01:23,310
Because you chose your
mother's veins over victory.

29
00:01:23,740 --> 00:01:27,180
On three. One, two, three, go!

30
00:01:29,270 --> 00:01:33,450
I had to take her! It's
almost bathing suit weather!

31
00:01:38,810 --> 00:01:41,990
I surrender! Don't
shoot! They went that way!

32
00:01:42,290 --> 00:01:44,770
Howard, I'm on your team.

33
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:47,240
Oh, Leslie, thank God.

34
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:49,470
Where's the rest of your squad?

35
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:52,650
Ah, they left me here to die.

36
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:54,150
What about yours?

37
00:01:54,190 --> 00:01:55,980
Dead, all of them.

38
00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:57,150
Sorry.

39
00:01:57,190 --> 00:02:00,730
Don't be. It was friendly fire.

40
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:04,320
They just wouldn't listen.

41
00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:10,130
Well, we're surrounded, so I
guess there's nothing for us to do

42
00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:13,290
but wait to be captured or killed.

43
00:02:13,330 --> 00:02:17,350
Hmm, that's the worst part, the waiting.

44
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:22,430
All the while knowing that there's a
paint pellet out there with your namen it.

45
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:28,010
Yeah, the big wet ball of death.

46
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:34,950
Kind of makes you feel
more alive, doesn't it?

47
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:37,590
It kind of does.

48
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:41,350
I say we make every moment count.

49
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:44,020
I agree.

50
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:46,490
How exactly do we do that?

51
00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:54,190
Howard, why aren't you covering us?
We're getting slaughtered out here!

52
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:56,650
War is hell.

56
00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:22,900
Did you guys see the new budget
memo that went out this morning?

57
00:03:22,910 --> 00:03:24,580
Yeah, more cutbacks.

58
00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:28,830
Unacceptable.It baffles me why
they don't simply let some of you go

59
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:32,460
so that there's money
available for my research.

60
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:34,880
You know what baffles me, Sheldon?

61
00:03:34,910 --> 00:03:38,560
Based on your academic record,
any number of things, I imagine.

62
00:03:38,570 --> 00:03:40,300
- Hey, guys.
- Hey, Leslie.

63
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:43,230
Howard, I got the approval for
the rapid prototyper you wanted.

64
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:45,340
That's great, Leslie. Thanks.

65
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:48,510
You scratch my back, I scratch yours.

66
00:03:51,470 --> 00:03:53,210
What was all that about?

67
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:57,950
Oh, uh, no big deal. They gave Leslie
control of some unrestricted grant money.

68
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:02,620
Yeah, okay, but what's with the back
- scratching and the meow!

69
00:04:03,390 --> 00:04:07,610
I believe the back-scratching metaphor
generally describes a quid p quo situation

70
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:12,540
where one party provides goods or services to the
second party in compensation for a similar action.

71
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:13,830
Thank you.

72
00:04:13,850 --> 00:04:18,560
The meow, that sounded to
me like an African civet cat.

73
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:20,940
Are you done?

74
00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:22,560
No.

75
00:04:22,570 --> 00:04:28,900
Despite what the name suggests,
the civet cat is not a true cat.

76
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:33,640
Now I'm done.

77
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:34,990
You know what I'm thinking?

78
00:04:35,050 --> 00:04:37,650
I'm thinking Howard wasn't
making a back-scratching metaphor.

79
00:04:37,690 --> 00:04:41,690
I'm thinking there was some
actual scratching involved.

80
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:45,710
What about it, Howard?

81
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:50,360
Okay, I didn't want to say anything 'cause
I know you and Leslie have a little history.

82
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:51,400
I don't care about that.

83
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:54,010
Great, 'cause I've been
dying to say something.

84
00:04:54,470 --> 00:04:55,580
You and Leslie?

85
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:58,660
In the paintball shed! Twice!

86
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:03,820
Is that why you didn't cover our escape
and let us get cut down like animals?

87
00:05:03,850 --> 00:05:06,540
Oh, yeah, sorry about that.

88
00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:12,870
My good man, dereliction of duty in the
face of the enemy is a court-martial offense.

89
00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:18,600
Court-martial, schmort-martial, Leslie Winkle
is the fifth girl I've ever had sex with.

90
00:05:19,230 --> 00:05:22,080
I mean, for free.

91
00:05:22,650 --> 00:05:24,180
And plus, you got a rapid prototyper.

92
00:05:24,210 --> 00:05:26,220
That's an expensive
piece of equipment, dude.

93
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:29,540
And the rest of us have had
our budgets cut to the bone.

94
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:33,210
Okay, one way to look at this is
that I'm getting new equipment,

95
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:35,140
and you're not, and that's unfair.

96
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:40,960
But a better way to look at this is that I'm
getting sex and you're not, and that's delightful.

97
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:46,210
The whole thing froze. I
don't know what happened.

98
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:47,390
Calm down. We'll figure it out.

99
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:50,280
How can I calm down? I'm gonna
lose my whole shopping cart.

100
00:05:50,290 --> 00:05:54,030
That's three hours of picking
out shoes just shot to hell.

101
00:05:54,790 --> 00:05:56,400
- Hello, Penny.
- Hello, Sheldon.

102
00:05:56,410 --> 00:05:58,820
You're in my spot.

103
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:00,890
Are you planning on sitting here?

104
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:03,060
No, I'm going to the comic book store.

105
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:04,450
Then what difference does it make?

106
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:07,540
- What difference does it make?
- Here we go.

107
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:09,450
That is my spot.

108
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:12,970
In an ever-changing world, it
is a single point of consistency.

109
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:18,380
If my life were expressed as a function on a
four-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system,

110
00:06:18,430 --> 00:06:23,950
that spot at the moment I first sat
on it would be zero-zero-zero-zero.

111
00:06:27,170 --> 00:06:29,120
What?

112
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:32,300
Don't sit in his spot.

113
00:06:33,790 --> 00:06:36,780
Fine. Happy?

114
00:06:36,790 --> 00:06:39,120
I'm not unhappy.

115
00:06:42,370 --> 00:06:46,180
Boy, I love him, but he
is one serious waadoodle.

116
00:06:46,890 --> 00:06:48,160
Okay, that should do it.

117
00:06:48,190 --> 00:06:50,830
Oh, thank you. You are a lifesaver.

118
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:52,530
That's a lot of shoes you ordered.

119
00:06:52,570 --> 00:06:56,460
Yeah, you know the sad
thing is, it's really not.

120
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:00,740
Ooh, is thisne of those paintball guns?

121
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:02,710
Yeah. You ought to come
out with us sometime.

122
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,770
Oh, no, thanks. I'm from Nebraska.

123
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:09,130
When we shoot things, it's because we want to
eat them or make them leave our boyfriends alone.

124
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:17,074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

125
00:07:27,390 --> 00:07:31,230
Boy, your heart's racing. I
must've really gotten you going.

126
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:36,310
Well, it's partly you, partly
my transient idiopaic arrhythmia.

127
00:07:37,550 --> 00:07:39,940
Sexy.

128
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:45,060
Can I assume that you likewise
found the experience...

129
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:47,430
Satisfactory?

130
00:07:47,970 --> 00:07:52,350
That wasn't quite the word I was looking
for, but sure, I'll do this pass-fail.

131
00:07:54,130 --> 00:07:56,430
Hey, are you enjoying
that prototyper I got you?

132
00:07:56,460 --> 00:07:57,780
Oh, it's great.

133
00:07:57,820 --> 00:08:01,610
Everybody in the Engineering
Department is eating their hearts out.

134
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:05,510
Isn't it nice when your good
fortune makes others miserable?

135
00:08:07,170 --> 00:08:10,840
You know, most people don't get that.

136
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:14,930
Howard, I'm home!

137
00:08:15,490 --> 00:08:16,380
Oh, great.

138
00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:18,030
Book club was cancelled!

139
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:22,190
That thing on Phyllis's
neck opened up again!

140
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:25,200
I'm busy, Ma!

141
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:28,700
Too busy to help your
mother with her zipper?

142
00:08:28,710 --> 00:08:30,280
Don't come in, Ma!

143
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:31,700
Why not?

144
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:34,970
He's got company!

145
00:08:39,590 --> 00:08:41,720
Oh, there's the arrhythmia.

146
00:08:41,730 --> 00:08:45,050
Is she Jewish?

147
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:46,330
- Are you Jewish?
- No.

148
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:48,500
Yes!

149
00:08:49,290 --> 00:08:53,130
Okay, then you kids have fun!

150
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:57,780
Use protection!

151
00:09:05,850 --> 00:09:08,850
You think he'll notice?

152
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:11,780
There's a chance.

153
00:09:11,790 --> 00:09:13,860
Oh, what are we gonna do?

154
00:09:13,890 --> 00:09:15,810
We?

155
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:20,960
No, no, you had your chance to be
"we" for, like, a year and a half now.

156
00:09:23,050 --> 00:09:26,790
Right now, you are "you,"
and you are screwed.

157
00:09:27,810 --> 00:09:29,240
Why do we have to tell him I did it?

158
00:09:29,270 --> 00:09:31,240
Well, we're not gonna tell him I did it.

159
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:33,160
Okay, okay, how about this?

160
00:09:33,170 --> 00:09:37,510
We tell him somebody broke in.

161
00:09:39,530 --> 00:09:42,870
Just to shoot the couch
with a paintball gun?

162
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:46,190
I'm sorry, Iuy it. All
those people are on drugs.

163
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:51,060
We could him they wanted the couch
to stay away from their boyfriend.

164
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:55,170
Okay, fine. What if
we just flip it over?

165
00:09:57,510 --> 00:09:59,480
There. Looks fine, right?

166
00:09:59,490 --> 00:10:03,970
Mm, butt print. There's
no discernible butt print.

167
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:07,780
Oh, come on.

168
00:10:09,530 --> 00:10:11,510
There, butt print.

169
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:14,950
It's too small and too... perfect.

170
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:18,580
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

171
00:10:19,290 --> 00:10:21,050
Act normal.

172
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:23,360
Sheldon!

173
00:10:23,780 --> 00:10:25,300
How was the comic book store?

174
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:27,940
Fine. e new issue of Flash is out.

175
00:10:27,950 --> 00:10:31,960
Great, great. Did you walk the
whole way? It's a little chilly.

176
00:10:31,970 --> 00:10:33,500
Koothrappali picked me up.

177
00:10:33,530 --> 00:10:35,530
Isn't that terrific?

178
00:10:35,550 --> 00:10:37,280
He is such a good friend.

179
00:10:37,330 --> 00:10:40,220
You know what the best
thing about friends is?

180
00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:43,810
They don't talk incessantly
for no particular reason.

181
00:10:43,830 --> 00:10:47,160
No, no, friends forgive
the little things.

182
00:10:47,190 --> 00:10:48,590
You know, I gotta go
home and wash my hair.

183
00:10:48,610 --> 00:10:50,860
Don't you dare, missy.

184
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:55,910
Hello, fastest man alive.

185
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:59,130
Want to see me read
your entire comic book?

186
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:02,940
Want to see it again?

187
00:11:20,630 --> 00:11:23,230
Something's wrong.

188
00:11:24,110 --> 00:11:25,120
What do you mean?

189
00:11:25,150 --> 00:11:27,410
I'm not sure.

190
00:11:36,550 --> 00:11:39,460
It doesn't feel right.

191
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:43,090
I don't know what you're talking about.

192
00:11:48,970 --> 00:11:51,600
Oh, that. Penny did that.

193
00:12:11,830 --> 00:12:13,740
Excuse me.

194
00:12:32,340 --> 00:12:34,630
Why don't you just
eat in your desk chair?

195
00:12:34,660 --> 00:12:37,260
Why don't I just eat in my desk chair?

196
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:39,430
Here we go.

197
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:42,250
That is my desk chair.
That is where I work.

198
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:46,160
I don't eat in my desk chair
and I don't work in my spot.

199
00:12:46,210 --> 00:12:49,660
I work in my desk chair
and eat in my spot.

200
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:51,730
Wackadoodle.

201
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:55,800
You know, there's kind of an
obvious solution here. Get up.

202
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:03,180
There. Problem solved.

203
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:07,790
Nobody cares where you're
going to sit. You're not crazy.

204
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:12,610
Excuse me, but the
problem is not solved.

205
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:17,460
If your head had been accidentally amputated,
and we transplanted a dog's head in its place,

206
00:13:17,490 --> 00:13:19,950
would that be "problem solved"?

207
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:22,860
If it were your head, it would be.

208
00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:26,130
Sheldon, I am really, really
sorry, but it's only for a week.

209
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:29,220
Can't you be a little bit flexible?

210
00:13:31,510 --> 00:13:34,460
Yeah, sorry. I didn't
really think that through.

211
00:13:34,470 --> 00:13:37,900
You claimed it's going to be a week,
but I have no faith in your dry cleaner.

212
00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:38,570
Why not?

213
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:40,740
Did you notice the sign on his counter?

214
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:43,280
He's not a full-time dry cleaner.

215
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:45,960
He also makes keys.

216
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,400
Oh, for God's sake, Sheldon.

217
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:49,180
Focus is important.

218
00:13:49,210 --> 00:13:52,950
Was Michael DeBakey a wedding
planner in between heart transplants?

219
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:55,490
Did Alexander Fleming
moonlight as a hairdresser?

220
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:59,750
"Thanks for discovering penicillin.
Now how about we try a bouffant?"

221
00:14:03,650 --> 00:14:06,680
Ooh, looks like I'm
gonna have sex tonight.

222
00:14:07,170 --> 00:14:08,050
Hey, baby...

223
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:10,910
His right hand is calling him?

224
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:16,470
No, it's Leslie Winkle.
It's a long story.

225
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:22,910
I'll pick you up in ten minutes.

226
00:14:22,940 --> 00:14:24,730
Gentlemen, adieu.

227
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:26,630
I thought we were going
to play Halo tonight.

228
00:14:26,670 --> 00:14:28,400
What am I supposed to do, Leonard?

229
00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:31,520
There's a woman out there
anxious to have sex with me.

230
00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:34,520
You understand, right?

231
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:39,760
No. Not at all.

232
00:14:39,770 --> 00:14:41,600
Nevertheless, I must depart.

233
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:42,650
By the way, did I tell you?

234
00:14:42,690 --> 00:14:47,750
Leslie pulled some strings and got me on the research
trip to Geneva to check out the CERN Supercollider.

235
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:50,280
That's not fair. You're
not even a physicist.

236
00:14:50,290 --> 00:14:52,280
Okay, there are two ways
of looking at this...

237
00:14:52,330 --> 00:14:54,800
- Get out.
- Bye.

238
00:14:57,940 --> 00:14:59,850
You're improving.

239
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:05,990
Thank you. It helps when I get
to practice with a real woman.

240
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:10,050
Hey, listen. Saturday my
sister's getting married.

241
00:15:10,060 --> 00:15:12,910
I-I want you to come
with me. It's black tie.

242
00:15:13,350 --> 00:15:17,370
Yeah, gee, I'd really rather not.

243
00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:18,830
Why not?

244
00:15:18,870 --> 00:15:23,060
When I go to weddings, it's
to scam on chunky bridesmaids.

245
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:26,260
I don't know what I
would do with a date.

246
00:15:26,270 --> 00:15:29,130
Oh, all right. I understand.

247
00:15:29,540 --> 00:15:31,890
Thanks.

248
00:15:31,910 --> 00:15:34,880
Hey, I'm really sorry
about that Geneva trip.

249
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:36,810
What about it?

250
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:37,970
Oh, didn't you hear?

251
00:15:38,010 --> 00:15:41,680
I had to reduce the number of people
going, and you didn't make the cut.

252
00:15:42,610 --> 00:15:43,930
When did that haen?

253
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:46,460
About 12 seconds ago.

254
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:53,500
Well, hold on. Are you saying if I don't
go to the wedding, I can't go to Geneva?

255
00:15:53,510 --> 00:15:56,360
Actually, I'm trying not to say it.

256
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:59,870
Okay, I'm sorry, but that
makes me a little uncomfortable.

257
00:15:59,890 --> 00:16:00,620
How so?

258
00:16:00,650 --> 00:16:05,330
Because it's like you're controlling me
with new equipment and research trips.

259
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:09,550
Well, if I weren't controlling you with new equipment
and research trips, then I'd be uncomfortable.

260
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:10,510
How so?

261
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:14,740
'Cause then we'd be in, like, a real
relationship with feelings and all that crap.

262
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:22,620
So, bottom line, I'm just a
bought-and-paid-for sex toy.

263
00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:30,510
No. No, noat all. You're also arm candy.

264
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:34,760
So? What do you think?

265
00:16:34,770 --> 00:16:37,930
Hey, Ma, you got to rent me a tux!

266
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:40,500
Right now?

267
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:44,270
What kind of sex are
you having up there?

268
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:54,880
Why are you crouching there?

269
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:57,710
This is my spot.

270
00:16:57,720 --> 00:17:00,690
Where else am I supposed to crouch?

271
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:04,280
I don't know. Texas?

272
00:17:06,740 --> 00:17:08,740
Here you go. Fresh from
the cleaners, good as new.

273
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:11,280
Really? Great. Sheldon,
look. Good as new.

274
00:17:11,290 --> 00:17:14,740
From that key maker, I highly doubt it.

275
00:17:15,210 --> 00:17:18,480
Come on, Sheldon. Just give it a try.

276
00:17:19,670 --> 00:17:22,160
All right.

277
00:17:24,030 --> 00:17:27,930
There, nice and comfy
cozy. Zero, zero, zero.

278
00:17:28,230 --> 00:17:31,110
There's one more zero.

279
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:33,790
You forgot the time parameter.

280
00:17:33,810 --> 00:17:36,890
Sit on the damn couch.

281
00:17:58,970 --> 00:18:00,870
Nope.

282
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:04,430
What do you mean, "nope"?
What's wrong with it?

283
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:07,460
Nothing, it's what's wrong with him.

284
00:18:07,470 --> 00:18:10,630
- It's exactly the same...
- Penny, Penny,

285
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:12,940
I think I know what to do.

286
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:15,340
Sheldon, I have some bad news.

287
00:18:15,370 --> 00:18:17,480
More?

288
00:18:17,490 --> 00:18:18,830
I'm afraid so.

289
00:18:18,870 --> 00:18:21,350
You know the cashew chicken
I get you Monday nights?

290
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:24,050
Yes. From Szechuan Palace.

291
00:18:24,350 --> 00:18:28,000
Szechuan Palace closed two years ago.

292
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:33,760
What? Whe did my cashew
chicken come from?

293
00:18:33,770 --> 00:18:36,680
Golden Dragon.

294
00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:42,660
No.

295
00:18:44,260 --> 00:18:46,320
No, this isn't right.

296
00:18:46,340 --> 00:18:49,480
Our food always comes in
Szechuan Palace containers.

297
00:18:49,530 --> 00:18:55,150
Yeah, well, before they went out of
business, I bought 4,000 containers.

298
00:18:55,670 --> 00:18:58,660
I keep them in the trunk of my car.

299
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:04,380
But... Oh, this changes everything.

300
00:19:05,830 --> 00:19:08,800
I thought that might take
his mind off the cushion.

301
00:19:08,810 --> 00:19:12,680
What's real? What isn't? How can I know?

302
00:19:13,570 --> 00:19:14,940
You did make that up, right?

303
00:19:14,970 --> 00:19:17,750
Oh, God, I wish I had.

304
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:20,510
- Leonard?
- Yeah, buddy?

305
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:23,460
I still don't like this cushion.

306
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:28,200
ll, Penny, thank you for coming.

307
00:19:28,230 --> 00:19:30,820
Thanks for the shoes.

308
00:19:30,830 --> 00:19:34,180
Penny is an amazing shot. I think we
have a real chance to win this week.

309
00:19:34,190 --> 00:19:36,970
- What's the plan?
- Okay. Now, we all run out.

310
00:19:36,980 --> 00:19:39,610
Sheldon and I will cut to
the left behind these trees.

311
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:42,380
Raj, Howard and Leslie flank
to the right behind the rocks.

312
00:19:42,430 --> 00:19:46,950
Then we'll all have a great view as Penny
runs out and kills everyone else in sight.

313
00:19:47,740 --> 00:19:49,430
Just one thing before we start.

314
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:51,650
What is it, Sheldon?

315
00:19:54,130 --> 00:19:55,780
What the hell?

316
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:58,660
That was for my cushion.

317
00:19:58,670 --> 00:20:00,840
Sheldon, Penny was our only hope.

318
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:06,690
I'm sorry, Leonard. But revenge
is a dish best served cold.

319
00:20:07,670 --> 00:20:10,310
Screw that.

320
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:14,250
She can't shoot me. She's dead.

321
00:20:14,260 --> 00:20:16,690
He's right. You can't.

322
00:20:21,910 --> 00:20:25,560
Well, if we're going to
descend into anarchy...

323
00:20:30,140 --> 00:20:33,170
Okay, see you.

324
00:20:33,830 --> 00:20:35,420
Where are you going?

325
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:37,950
Surrender, then Denny's.

326
