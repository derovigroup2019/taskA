1
00:00:03,820 --> 00:00:05,981
Oh, boy.

2
00:00:07,190 --> 00:00:08,214
What?

3
00:00:08,391 --> 00:00:13,328
I can't comment without violating our
agreement that I not criticize your work.

4
00:00:13,496 --> 00:00:18,490
- Then what was "Oh, boy"?
- Great restraint on my part.

5
00:00:18,902 --> 00:00:21,097
There's nothing wrong
with the science here.

6
00:00:21,271 --> 00:00:25,833
Perhaps you mean a different thing
than I do when you say "science."

7
00:00:32,716 --> 00:00:33,944
Okay, how's that?

8
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:36,716
You actually had it right
in the first place.

9
00:00:38,121 --> 00:00:42,182
Once again, you've fallen
for one of my classic pranks.

10
00:00:42,358 --> 00:00:43,586
Buzzinga.

11
00:00:49,032 --> 00:00:51,159
Well, now, here's a peculiar e-mail.

12
00:00:51,334 --> 00:00:55,430
The president of the university wants me
to meet him at his office at 8 a.m.

13
00:00:55,605 --> 00:00:58,665
- Why?
- Doesn't say. Must be an emergency.

14
00:00:58,842 --> 00:01:01,504
Everyone at the university knows
I eat breakfast at 8...

15
00:01:01,678 --> 00:01:03,942
...and move my bowels at 8:20.

16
00:01:05,115 --> 00:01:08,175
Yes, how did we live before Twitter?

17
00:01:09,986 --> 00:01:12,386
I guess you'll find out what it is
in the morning.

18
00:01:12,555 --> 00:01:14,216
That's 14 hours away.

19
00:01:14,390 --> 00:01:18,349
For the next 840 minutes, I'm effectively
one of Heisenberg's particles.

20
00:01:18,528 --> 00:01:21,656
I know where I am or how fast I'm going,
but I can't know both.

21
00:01:21,831 --> 00:01:23,731
Yet how am I supposed to carry on...

22
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:26,801
...with this huge annoying thing
hovering over my head?

23
00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:28,669
Yeah, I know the feeling.

Leonard.

27
00:01:59,469 --> 00:02:01,494
Sheldon, it's 2:00 in the morning.

28
00:02:01,671 --> 00:02:05,038
Why does everybody keep telling me
what time it is?

29
00:02:05,208 --> 00:02:08,075
- Everybody?
- You, the president of the university...

30
00:02:08,244 --> 00:02:10,405
...his wife,
their sullen teenage daughter.

31
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:16,485
That entire family is fascinated by what
time it is and whether people know it.

32
00:02:16,686 --> 00:02:19,712
You went to President Seibert's house
in the middle of the night?

33
00:02:19,889 --> 00:02:22,824
He didn't respond to my e-mail,
his phone number is unlisted.

34
00:02:22,992 --> 00:02:25,392
Tell me what my other option was.

35
00:02:25,562 --> 00:02:27,860
You could have waited until morning.

36
00:02:28,031 --> 00:02:30,761
I know, look who I'm talking to.

37
00:02:32,001 --> 00:02:35,698
Remember the grant proposal I submitted
to the National Science Foundation...

38
00:02:35,872 --> 00:02:38,864
...to detect slow-moving monopoles
at the magnetic north pole?

39
00:02:39,042 --> 00:02:42,603
Hardly a day goes by
when I don't think about it.

40
00:02:42,846 --> 00:02:44,279
Oh, how nice.

41
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:46,846
Well, a space opened up
at the last minute...

42
00:02:47,016 --> 00:02:50,383
...on the NSF expedition
to the Arctic Circle.

43
00:02:50,553 --> 00:02:52,111
Wait a minute.

[TOILET FLUSHES]

45
00:02:55,225 --> 00:02:57,193
He offered to send you
to the North Pole?

46
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:00,022
Yes.
In fact, he was quite enthusiastic.

47
00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:03,988
He said, "Frankly,
if I could send you tonight, I would."

48
00:03:05,802 --> 00:03:07,861
Okay. Well, do you wanna go?

49
00:03:08,037 --> 00:03:10,767
Of course not.
I'm a theoretical physicist.

50
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:14,808
A career I chose in no small part
because it's indoors.

51
00:03:15,411 --> 00:03:18,938
But if I'm able to detect slow-moving
magnetic monopoles there...

52
00:03:19,115 --> 00:03:21,777
...I will be the scientist
who confirmed string theory.

53
00:03:21,951 --> 00:03:23,885
And people will write books about me.

54
00:03:24,053 --> 00:03:29,286
Third graders will create macaroni-art
dioramas depicting scenes from my life.

55
00:03:29,893 --> 00:03:33,954
Sure. Maybe a tableau of me
trying to pummel you to death.

56
00:03:34,764 --> 00:03:36,459
Sarcasm?

57
00:03:36,633 --> 00:03:38,328
Maybe.

58
00:03:39,235 --> 00:03:41,294
I am on the horns of a dilemma.

59
00:03:41,471 --> 00:03:45,464
Can you imagine me, Sheldon Cooper,
at the North Pole?

60
00:03:45,642 --> 00:03:47,610
Easy peasy. I'm doing it right now.

61
00:03:48,845 --> 00:03:50,813
I'm not good with cold, Leonard.

62
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:53,312
How often have we had to leave
a movie theater...

63
00:03:53,483 --> 00:03:56,850
...because I got a headache
from drinking the Icee too fast?

64
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:59,111
- I can't go.
- Then don't go.

65
00:03:59,289 --> 00:04:03,692
How can you say that? The scientific
opportunity of a lifetime presents itself...

66
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:06,021
...my best friend says, "Don't go."

67
00:04:06,195 --> 00:04:09,255
- All right, then go.
- Listen to you.

68
00:04:11,367 --> 00:04:13,358
How can I possibly go?

69
00:04:13,569 --> 00:04:15,298
What are the words I can say now...

70
00:04:15,471 --> 00:04:18,133
...to end this conversation
and let me go back to sleep?

71
00:04:18,641 --> 00:04:23,601
Odd. President Seibert posed
the exact same question.

72
00:04:24,948 --> 00:04:26,176
How was it resolved?

73
00:04:26,349 --> 00:04:30,809
It wasn't. His wife set their dogs on me
and rendered the question moot.

74
00:04:32,655 --> 00:04:34,885
Just imagine. If he says yes...

75
00:04:35,091 --> 00:04:38,652
...we'll have an entire summer
without Sheldon.

76
00:04:39,629 --> 00:04:41,995
We could play outside.

77
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:45,793
We could sit
on the left side of the couch.

78
00:04:45,969 --> 00:04:48,665
I could use the bathroom at 8:20.

79
00:04:52,608 --> 00:04:55,304
Our dreams are very small,
aren't they?

80
00:04:57,313 --> 00:05:00,840
Good news, gentlemen.
I have tentatively accepted--

81
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:02,915
ALL:
Yeah!

82
00:05:06,990 --> 00:05:09,891
--the invitation
to join the Arctic expedition.

83
00:05:10,326 --> 00:05:13,489
- It's not gonna be the same without you.
- We're gonna miss you.

84
00:05:13,663 --> 00:05:17,155
Thank you,
but your sentiments may be premature.

85
00:05:17,333 --> 00:05:19,733
Oh, I don't like where this is going.

86
00:05:19,902 --> 00:05:21,870
I would like to propose...

87
00:05:22,772 --> 00:05:25,172
...that the three of you
accompany me.

88
00:05:25,341 --> 00:05:28,936
- To the North Pole?
- Yes.

89
00:05:29,145 --> 00:05:32,273
Is this just so we won't touch your stuff
while you're away?

90
00:05:33,916 --> 00:05:36,248
I'll admit that was a concern.

91
00:05:36,419 --> 00:05:41,083
But the fact is, I'll need a support team
and the three of you are my first choice.

92
00:05:41,257 --> 00:05:43,885
- Really?
- Others might be more qualified...

93
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:47,188
...but the thought of interviewing them
gave me a stomachache.

94
00:05:48,031 --> 00:05:50,397
I know I'm proposing
an enormous undertaking...

95
00:05:50,566 --> 00:05:53,592
...so why don't you take a few moments
to discuss it?

96
00:05:55,538 --> 00:05:58,473
We're not really gonna go
to the North Pole with him, are we?

97
00:05:58,674 --> 00:06:01,108
SHELDON:
I'm still within earshot.

98
00:06:01,577 --> 00:06:04,546
You may wanna wait
for my door to close.

99
00:06:04,714 --> 00:06:05,738
[DOOR CLOSES]

100
00:06:05,948 --> 00:06:09,042
We're not really gonna go
to the North Pole with him, are we?

101
00:06:09,218 --> 00:06:13,120
Hang on, let's talk about it. This is a
National Science Foundation expedition.

102
00:06:13,289 --> 00:06:15,257
I don't know
how we can turn it down.

103
00:06:15,425 --> 00:06:19,418
Easy. Instead of saying, "No, we don't
wanna go on an NSF expedition," say:

104
00:06:19,595 --> 00:06:23,224
"No, we don't wanna spend three months
stuck in a cabin in the Arctic Circle...

105
00:06:23,399 --> 00:06:25,458
...with an anal nutbag."

106
00:06:26,102 --> 00:06:29,435
But if we were part of the team
that confirmed string theory...

107
00:06:29,605 --> 00:06:32,938
...we could drink for free in any bar,
in any college town...

108
00:06:33,109 --> 00:06:37,011
...with a university
that has a strong science program.

109
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:40,276
Howard, this is big science.
You could be the engineer...

110
00:06:40,450 --> 00:06:43,647
...who builds the equipment
that puts us on the cover of magazines.

111
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:48,848
I could also be the engineer who builds
the crossbow that kills Sheldon.

112
00:06:52,295 --> 00:06:54,991
You still might get on a magazine.

113
00:06:56,232 --> 00:06:59,793
- You guys are seriously considering this?
- Yes.

114
00:06:59,969 --> 00:07:03,962
- You think you can put up with Sheldon?
- Well, I'm a Hindu.

115
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:08,975
My religion teaches that if we suffer
in this life, we are rewarded in the next.

116
00:07:09,145 --> 00:07:11,773
Three months at the North Pole
with Sheldon...

117
00:07:11,948 --> 00:07:15,748
...and I'm reborn
as a well-hung billionaire with wings.

118
00:07:22,558 --> 00:07:25,254
Well, gentlemen,
have you reached a decision?

119
00:07:25,962 --> 00:07:29,056
- I'm in.
- Me too.

120
00:07:30,566 --> 00:07:32,363
Damn it. Peer pressure. Fine.

121
00:07:34,003 --> 00:07:37,632
Excellent. And just an FYI,
as I am the expedition's team leader...

122
00:07:37,807 --> 00:07:41,038
...protocol dictates that be phrased,
"Fine, sir."

123
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:44,338
But don't worry,
there will be a briefing.

...to the Cheesecake Factory's
walk-in freezer.

00:08:19,182 --> 00:08:20,615

...the hamburger meat is fresh
and stored at a safe temperature.

137
00:08:24,887 --> 00:08:30,086
No, this is to train for a three-month
expedition to the magnetic north pole.

138
00:08:30,626 --> 00:08:31,854
What?

139
00:08:32,028 --> 00:08:35,429
I don't know how that sentence
could possibly confuse you...

140
00:08:36,966 --> 00:08:39,594
...but to elaborate,
I am going to the Arctic Circle...

141
00:08:39,769 --> 00:08:41,862
...with Leonard, Wolowitz,
and Koothrappali.

142
00:08:42,038 --> 00:08:43,801
- You're all going?
- Yes.

143
00:08:43,973 --> 00:08:45,406
- For three months?
- Yes.

144
00:08:46,209 --> 00:08:48,143
Excuse me.

145
00:08:49,879 --> 00:08:51,904
Wait, is that a yes or a no
on the freezer?

146
00:08:52,081 --> 00:08:55,539
That woman has the attention span
of a gnat.

147
00:08:56,152 --> 00:08:59,451
Hey, Leonard. Sheldon says
you're going to the North Pole.

148
00:08:59,622 --> 00:09:00,919
Yeah. Pretty cool, huh?

149
00:09:01,090 --> 00:09:03,957
Yeah, I'm just a little surprised
you didn't tell me.

150
00:09:04,126 --> 00:09:05,787
Well, it all happened kind of fast.

151
00:09:05,962 --> 00:09:08,897
And we had to get physicals
and buy thermal underwear...

152
00:09:09,065 --> 00:09:11,863
...and study up on, you know,
snow and stuff.

153
00:09:13,436 --> 00:09:16,496
- Sorry, I was gonna tell you.
- No, you don't have to apologize.

154
00:09:16,672 --> 00:09:19,937
There's no reason you have to tell me.
I was just surprised.

155
00:09:20,109 --> 00:09:22,839
You were busy, you were surprised,
all very fascinating.

156
00:09:23,012 --> 00:09:24,809
Now, where do we stand
on the freezer?

00:09:25,915 --> 00:09:27,143
Is he serious?

158
00:09:27,516 --> 00:09:29,006
Actually, it would help.

159
00:09:29,752 --> 00:09:31,913
All right, I'll see what I can do.

160
00:09:32,088 --> 00:09:35,148
So, wow, three months
at the North Pole.

00:09:35,324 --> 00:09:38,782
- Wow, that is awesome.
- Yeah.

00:09:38,961 --> 00:09:43,955
Sorry but at what point do you put this
"see what you can do" plan into action?

163
00:09:45,201 --> 00:09:50,195
Just a warning, Sheldon.
The freezer locks from the outside.

00:09:54,644 --> 00:09:59,013

- No. Did she seem upset to you?
