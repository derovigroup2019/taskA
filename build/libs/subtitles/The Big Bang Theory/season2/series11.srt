1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,200
Your argument is lacking in all scientific merit.

2
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:04,730
It is well established

3
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:06,800
Superman cleans his uniform

4
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:08,530
by flying into Earth's yellow sun,

5
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:10,500
which incinerates any contaminate matter

6
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:11,600
and leaves the invulnerable

7
00:00:11,660 --> 00:00:15,060
Kryptonian fabric unharmed and daisy fresh.

8
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:18,360
What if he gets something Kryptonian on it?

9
00:00:18,430 --> 00:00:19,460
Like what?

10
00:00:19,530 --> 00:00:22,400
I don't know. Kryptonian mustard.

11
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:25,030
I think we can safely assume that all Kryptonian condiments

12
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:28,900
were destroyed when the planet Krypton exploded.

13
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:30,400
Or it turned into mustard Kryptonite,

14
00:00:30,460 --> 00:00:31,730
the only way to destroy

15
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:34,830
a rogue Kryptonian hotdog threatening Earth.

16
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:36,300
Raj, please,

17
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:38,500
let's stay serious here.

18
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:40,360
Superman's body is Kryptonian,

19
00:00:40,430 --> 00:00:42,100
therefore his sweat is Kryptonian.

20
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:44,760
Yeah, what about Kryptonian pit stains?

21
00:00:44,830 --> 00:00:46,700
Superman doesn't sweat on Earth.

22
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:48,130
Okay,

23
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:50,200
he's invited for dinner in the Bottle City of Kandor.

24
00:00:50,260 --> 00:00:51,660
He miniaturizes himself, enters the city

25
00:00:51,730 --> 00:00:53,200
where he loses his superpowers. Now,

26
00:00:53,260 --> 00:00:54,530
before dinner, his host says,

27
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:56,730
"Who's up for a little Kryptonian tetherball?"

28
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:58,730
Superman says "Sure," works up a sweat,

29
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:00,360
comes back to Earth, his uniform now stained

30
00:01:00,430 --> 00:01:02,860
with indestructible Kryptonian perspiration.

31
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:08,000
Boo ya.

32
00:01:09,730 --> 00:01:11,330
Superman would have taken his uniform

33
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:13,860
to a Kandorian dry cleaner before he left the Bottle.

34
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:17,030
"Kandorian dry cl..." I give up.

35
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:19,400
You can't have a rational argument with this man.

36
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:23,160
isn't that the guy who won

37
00:01:23,230 --> 00:01:24,800
the MacArthur genius grant last year?

38
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:27,730
No, not all at once.

39
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:29,230
Then how?

40
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:30,500
Leonard.

41
00:01:32,230 --> 00:01:33,400
Now, Raj.

42
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:36,730
Now, Sheldon.

43
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,630
I didn't get a good look. Can I go again?

44
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:42,130
No.

45
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:44,160
It's David Underhill. So what?

46
00:01:44,230 --> 00:01:45,300
So what?

47
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:47,500
His observation of high-energy positrons

48
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:49,200
has provided the first conclusive evidence

49
00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:51,230
for the existence of galactic dark matter.

50
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:52,430
I have two words for you.

51
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:53,830
The first is "big," the other's "whoop."

52
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:55,960
<i>It is a big whoop.</i>

53
00:01:56,030 --> 00:01:57,400
It made almost all the work

54
00:01:57,460 --> 00:01:59,200
you've done since you've been here completely useless.

55
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:00,360
Did not. Did, too.

56
00:02:00,430 --> 00:02:01,460
Did...

57
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:02,730
<i>Okay, maybe  some of it, but...</i>

58
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:06,260
Look, the guy was just in the right place,

59
00:02:06,330 --> 00:02:07,900
at the right time with the right paradigm-shifting

60
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:11,460
reinterpretation of the universe. He got lucky.

61
00:02:11,530 --> 00:02:12,800
In more ways than one.

62
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:16,130
He's a very handsome man.

63
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:18,600
Doesn't do anything for me. If I was gonna go that way,

64
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:21,900
I'm more of a Zac Ephron kinda guy.

65
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:26,230
Oh, yeah, like you have a shot with Zac Ephron.

66
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:28,530
Excuse me...

67
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:30,330
Are you Leonard Hofstadter?

68
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,760
Uh... yeah.

69
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:32,830
I'm David Underhill.

70
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:36,160
Uh... y-yeah.

71
00:02:36,230 --> 00:02:37,600
Yeah, Dr. Gablehauser said if I wanted

72
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:39,230
to set something up in the photomultiplier lab,

73
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:41,060
that you'd be able to give me a hand?

74
00:02:41,130 --> 00:02:43,000
<i>You want to work with me? Well,</i>

75
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:44,230
if you have a little time, yeah.

76
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:46,730
Wow.... Y-yeah, sure.

77
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,700
Yeah, no problem. Uh...

78
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:50,160
Here's my home number.

79
00:02:50,230 --> 00:02:51,160
Here's my cell.

80
00:02:51,230 --> 00:02:53,160
Here's my office.

81
00:02:53,230 --> 00:02:56,360
Here's my parents' number up in New Jersey.

82
00:02:56,430 --> 00:02:58,230
They always know how to reach me. So... Okay.

83
00:02:58,300 --> 00:03:01,230
Congratulations on the MacArthur Grant, by the way. Big fan.

84
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:03,360
Thanks. I'll call you.

85
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:05,130
Okay.

86
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:06,900
Bye-bye!

87
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:11,860
What are you looking at?

88
00:03:11,930 --> 00:03:13,360
You've never seen a hypocrite before?

89
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:41,100
Trailing badly, Wolowitz needs a strike

90
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:43,560
if he has any hopes of catching up with Sheldon Cooper,

91
00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:45,260
who is dominating in the ninth frame

92
00:03:45,330 --> 00:03:47,780
with a career-best 68.

93
00:03:57,300 --> 00:03:59,560
Hey, guys!

94
00:03:59,630 --> 00:04:00,700
That doesn't count.

95
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:02,200
Do over! Do over!

96
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:04,700
There are no do-overs in Wii bowling.

97
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:09,030
There are always do-overs when my people play sports.

98
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:11,230
Where were you that's more important

99
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:12,400
than Wii bowling night?

100
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:13,400
Actually, I was...

101
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:14,430
It's a rhetorical question.

102
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:15,560
<i>There is nothing more important</i>

103
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:17,200
than Wii bowling night.

104
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:19,430
Come on, it's just a video game.

105
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:20,460
And we suck at it.

106
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:24,800
Nice motivational speech from the team captain.

107
00:04:25,730 --> 00:04:26,760
<i>Where were you?</i>

108
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:28,400
I was working with Dave Underhill.

109
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:32,660
Ooh, "Dave." Sounds like Leonard's got a new BFF.

110
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:34,930
Actually, he's pretty cool.

111
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,260
I mean, not only is he a brilliant scientist,

112
00:04:37,330 --> 00:04:39,660
but it turns out he's a Black Diamond skier.

113
00:04:39,730 --> 00:04:42,930
He collects vintage motorcycles. He plays in a rock band.

114
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,800
So? We're in a rock band.

115
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:46,800
No...

116
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:50,230
We play Rock Band on our X-Box.

117
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:54,330
Nice motivational speech from our lead guitarist.

118
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:55,400
He's funny, too.

119
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:57,560
He does this hysterical impersonation

120
00:04:57,630 --> 00:04:59,860
of Stephen Hawking having phone sex.

121
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:03,800
What are you wearing?

122
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,530
That's not... He does it better.

123
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:09,230
Anyway, he said he was gonna take me to the gym tomorrow,

124
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:10,930
so I'm gonna go practice my situps.

125
00:05:11,930 --> 00:05:15,930
Whoa. Humongous man crush, dude.

126
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,660
Yeah. It's officially a bro-mance.

127
00:05:19,730 --> 00:05:21,560
Hey, Sheldon, are you and Leonard

128
00:05:21,630 --> 00:05:22,930
putting up a Christmas tree?

129
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,560
No, because we don't celebrate

130
00:05:24,630 --> 00:05:27,230
the ancient pagan festival of Saturnalia.

131
00:05:28,630 --> 00:05:29,800
Saturnalia?

132
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:31,130
Gather round, kids,

133
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:35,530
it's time for Sheldon's beloved Christmas special.

134
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:37,930
In the pre-Christian era,

135
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,460
as the winter solstice approached and the plants died,

136
00:05:40,530 --> 00:05:42,930
pagans brought evergreen boughs into their homes

137
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,960
as an act of sympathetic magic, intended

138
00:05:45,030 --> 00:05:47,860
to guard the life essences of the plants until spring.

139
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:49,600
This custom was later appropriated

140
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:51,600
by Northern Europeans and eventually it becomes

141
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:53,660
the so-called Christmas tree.

142
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:59,430
And that, Charlie Brown, is what boredom is all about.

143
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,100
Okay, well, thank you

144
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,700
for that, but I got you and Leonard

145
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:05,260
a few silly neighbor gifts, so I'll just

146
00:06:05,330 --> 00:06:06,260
<i>put them under my tree.</i>

147
00:06:06,330 --> 00:06:07,130
Wait!

148
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:09,160
You bought me a present?

149
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:12,330
Why would you do such a thing?

150
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:15,030
I don't know. 'Cause it's Christmas?

151
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:17,530
Oh, Penny. I know you think you're being generous,

152
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:20,430
but the foundation of gift-giving is reciprocity.

153
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:22,100
You haven't given me a gift.

154
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:24,630
You've given me an obligation.

155
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:28,900
Don't feel bad, Penny, it's a classic rookie mistake.

156
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,300
My first Hanukkah with Sheldon,

157
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:32,060
he yelled at me for eight nights.

158
00:06:34,330 --> 00:06:36,530
Now, hey, it's okay.You don't have to get me anything in return.

159
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,400
Of course I do. The essence of the custom

160
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:40,860
is that I now have to go out and purchase for you

161
00:06:40,930 --> 00:06:42,360
a gift of commensurate value

162
00:06:42,430 --> 00:06:44,600
and representing the same perceived level of friendship

163
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:47,800
as that represented by the gift you've given me.

164
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:51,100
It's no wonder suicide rates skyrocket this time of year.

165
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:52,830
Okay, you know what? Forget it.

166
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:54,100
I'm not giving you a present.

167
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:56,060
No, it's too late. I see it. That elf sticker

168
00:06:56,130 --> 00:06:57,230
says, "To Sheldon."

169
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:00,060
The die has been cast.

170
00:07:00,130 --> 00:07:01,530
[???·???????  ??????·??·???]

171
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:03,330
[???????????????????????????????]

172
00:07:05,330 --> 00:07:06,300
I know. It's funny

173
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:08,660
when it's not happening to us.

174
00:07:09,730 --> 00:07:13,330
Sheldon, I am very, very sorry.

175
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:15,030
No. No, I brought this on myself

176
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:18,560
by being such an endearing and important part of your life.

177
00:07:19,730 --> 00:07:22,130
I'm going to need a ride to the mall.

178
00:07:23,130 --> 00:07:25,430
It's happening to us.

179
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:30,760
Are you gonna make it?

180
00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:31,960
Yeah, I guess.

181
00:07:32,030 --> 00:07:33,160
All right.

182
00:07:33,230 --> 00:07:36,560
Thanks for letting me try out your motorcycle.

183
00:07:36,630 --> 00:07:39,100
No problem.

184
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:42,460
I had no idea it was so heavy.

185
00:07:42,530 --> 00:07:45,260
The thing just fell right over on me, didn't it?

186
00:07:45,330 --> 00:07:47,960
Yeah. Lucky for you it wasn't moving.

187
00:07:48,030 --> 00:07:50,930
-Oh, hey, Leonard. Ooh, are you okay? -Oh, yeah.

188
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,430
It's just a little motorcycle accident.

189
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:55,300
My God, how fast were you going?

190
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:57,860
I don't know. It's all such a blur.

191
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:01,430
Good one. He couldn't even get it started.

192
00:08:02,330 --> 00:08:03,930
Hi. Dave. Hi.

193
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,060
<i>Penny. So it's your motorcycle?</i>

194
00:08:06,930 --> 00:08:07,860
Is it okay?

195
00:08:07,930 --> 00:08:08,860
It's fine.

196
00:08:08,930 --> 00:08:10,530
Lucky for the bike

197
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:12,760
it landed on my leg.

198
00:08:12,830 --> 00:08:15,060
You mind giving me a hand with speed racer here?

199
00:08:15,130 --> 00:08:16,300
Oh, yeah. Yeah, sure.

200
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:18,900
So, um, Dave, how do you know Leonard?

201
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:20,100
I'm a physicist.

202
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:23,430
No, you're not.

203
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:25,230
Why is that so surprising?

204
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:27,760
Uh, well, it's just that the physicists I know

205
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:31,430
are indoorsy and pale.

206
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:32,760
I'm not indoorsy.

207
00:08:32,830 --> 00:08:34,430
I just wear the appropriate sun block

208
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:36,660
because I don't take melanoma lightly.

209
00:08:36,730 --> 00:08:37,900
So, are you

210
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:39,660
and Leonard working on an experiment together?

211
00:08:39,730 --> 00:08:40,900
Yeah, actually we are.

212
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:42,430
Yeah, we're examining the radiation levels

213
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:43,460
of photomultiplier tubes

214
00:08:43,530 --> 00:08:44,930
for a new dark matter detector.

215
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,030
Uh, sweetie, sweetie,

216
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:48,360
Dave was talking.

217
00:08:48,430 --> 00:08:50,600
You know, I love science.

218
00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:52,930
-Since when? -Since always.

219
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,260
Call me a geek, but I am just nuts

220
00:08:55,330 --> 00:08:57,730
for the whole subatomic- particle thing.

221
00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:00,460
The last thing I would ever call you is a geek.

222
00:09:00,530 --> 00:09:02,400
Ha. Well, that's what I am--

223
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:03,730
queen of the nerds.

224
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:05,760
Well, if you like,

225
00:09:05,830 --> 00:09:07,730
I could show you the lab we're working in.

226
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:10,200
We've got some cool toys, you know-- lasers and stuff.

227
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:13,660
You know, I have always wanted to see a big science lab.

228
00:09:13,730 --> 00:09:14,660
Since when?

229
00:09:14,730 --> 00:09:16,500
Since always.

230
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:18,200
Leonard, are you okay here? Uh...

231
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:20,430
-Yeah. I guess. -How 'bout we go see it now?

232
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:22,360
Maybe afterwards we take the bike up the coast,

233
00:09:22,430 --> 00:09:23,800
We grab a little bite to eat...

234
00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:25,500
Um... Yeah. Yeah, that sounds great.

235
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:26,760
Let me just get my jacket.

236
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:34,560
Boy, she'll do, huh?

237
00:09:34,630 --> 00:09:37,100
Yeah, if you like that type.

238
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:39,200
So, you and her...?

239
00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:40,260
No, just neighbors.

240
00:09:40,330 --> 00:09:41,530
Really.

241
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,600
I don't know how you live next door to that

242
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:45,700
without doing something about it.

243
00:09:46,830 --> 00:09:48,900
Actually...

244
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:50,600
science is my lady.

245
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:54,100
Okay. Let's go.

246
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:55,100
All right.

247
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:56,460
See you tomorrow, Leonard.

248
00:09:56,530 --> 00:09:58,460
See ya. 'Bye, Penny.

249
00:09:58,530 --> 00:10:00,100
Have fun.

250
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:05,860
Yes?

251
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:15,500
Did you forget your key?

252
00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:29,130
I don't see anything in here a woman would want.

253
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:32,680
You're kidding.

254
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:35,950
You've got lotions and bath oils and soaps.

255
00:10:36,020 --> 00:10:39,080
that's the estrogen hat trick.

256
00:10:39,150 --> 00:10:42,550
What it is is a cacophonous assault

257
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:45,280
of eucalyptus, bayberry, cinnamon and vanilla.

258
00:10:45,350 --> 00:10:49,680
It's as if my head were trapped in the pajamas of a sultan.

259
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:51,780
Sheldon, if you don't like this stuff,

260
00:10:51,850 --> 00:10:54,950
let's just go next door and build her a bear.

261
00:10:55,020 --> 00:10:58,720
I told you before, bears are terrifying.

262
00:10:58,780 --> 00:11:00,620
Come on,

263
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:02,550
bath stuff. It's perfect!

264
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:05,450
You got a scented candle, a cleansing buff,

265
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:08,150
spearmint and green tea scented bath oil, promotes relaxation.

266
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:09,920
That presupposes Penny is tense.

267
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:11,250
She knows you. She's tense.

268
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:12,950
We all are. Buy a basket!

269
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:14,450
Excuse me, we're ready.

270
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:15,980
No, we're not.

271
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:17,950
Let's say for a moment that I accept

272
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:19,750
the bath item gift hypothesis,

273
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:21,820
I now lay the following conundrum at your feet:

274
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:24,250
Which size?

275
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:26,180
This one. Let's go.

276
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:27,780
You put no thought into that.

277
00:11:27,850 --> 00:11:30,220
I'm sorry. Uh... this one.

278
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:32,120
Let's go!

279
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:35,120
I have insufficient data to proceed.

280
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:36,520
Excuse me, miss?

281
00:11:36,580 --> 00:11:37,750
Yes?

282
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:40,520
If I were to give you this gift basket,

283
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:43,050
based on that action alone and no other data,

284
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:45,620
infer and describe the hypothetical relationship

285
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:47,820
that exists between us.

286
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:50,650
Excuse me?

287
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:52,780
Here.

288
00:11:52,850 --> 00:11:55,020
Now, are we friends?

289
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:57,850
Colleagues? Lovers?

290
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:59,980
Are you my grandmother?

291
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:03,680
I don't understand what you're talking about

292
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:05,820
and you're making me a little uncomfortable.

293
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:08,620
See? Sounds just like you and Penny.

294
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:09,850
We'll take it.

295
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:15,920
Hey, Leonard. Come, join us.

296
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:17,720
Oh, hey, Dave.

297
00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:19,980
And Penny, what a surprise.

298
00:12:20,050 --> 00:12:21,350
Hey, Leonard.

299
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:22,580
Dave was just showing me around the university.

300
00:12:22,650 --> 00:12:23,920
You know, this place

301
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:25,080
is unbelievable!

302
00:12:25,150 --> 00:12:26,380
Yeah, I know. I've been offering

303
00:12:26,450 --> 00:12:28,920
to show you around for a year and a half.

304
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:30,750
You always said you had yoga.

305
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:32,480
I never said that.

306
00:12:32,550 --> 00:12:34,420
Maybe I heard you wrong.

307
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:36,920
A lot of words sound like "yoga."

308
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:39,250
This is an amazing woman, Leonard.

309
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:41,450
She has a curious and agile mind,

310
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:44,520
not to mention being curious and agile in other respects.

311
00:12:44,580 --> 00:12:46,520
Oh, shut up!

312
00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:49,180
Yes, please shut up.

313
00:12:49,250 --> 00:12:51,750
So, um, Dave,

314
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:54,120
don't you think you and I should get back to the lab?

315
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:56,520
You know, that dark matter isn't going to detect itself.

316
00:13:00,550 --> 00:13:02,650
Actually, I was thinking about taking the afternoon off

317
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,580
so I could work on another experiment with Penny.

318
00:13:04,650 --> 00:13:07,420
Really? We're going to do an experiment?

319
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:09,450
Uh-huh. We're going to explore the effects of tequila shots

320
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:11,950
on a gorgeous 22-year-old woman.

321
00:13:12,020 --> 00:13:13,280
It's not an experiment!

322
00:13:13,350 --> 00:13:15,280
You saw what happened last night.

323
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:18,680
You ready to go? Yeah.

324
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:19,920
Oh, can I drive the motorcycle?

325
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:21,180
Yeah, why not?

326
00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:23,350
You can't do any worse than Leonard.

327
00:13:23,420 --> 00:13:25,720
That's funny.

328
00:13:27,850 --> 00:13:29,680
By the way, my leg is killing me.

329
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:32,050
Thanks for asking.

330
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:56,420
Mmm, great news, Leonard.

331
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:58,680
I've solved my Penny gift dilemma.

332
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:00,980
Yippee.

333
00:14:01,050 --> 00:14:04,050
You see, the danger was that I might under or over-reciprocate,

334
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:06,050
but I have devised a foolproof plan.

335
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:08,980
See, I will open her gift to me first

336
00:14:09,050 --> 00:14:10,420
and then excuse myself,

337
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:13,250
feigning digestive distress.

338
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:15,250
Then I'll look up the price of her gift online,

339
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:17,350
choose the basket closest to that value,

340
00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:18,950
give it to her

341
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:22,750
and then I'll return the others for a full refund.

342
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:25,150
Brilliant.

343
00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:27,680
It is, isn't it?

344
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:30,320
Is it okay if I hide them in your room?

345
00:14:30,380 --> 00:14:33,320
The smell makes me nauseated.

346
00:14:33,380 --> 00:14:34,720
Do whatever you want.

347
00:14:34,780 --> 00:14:36,650
Thank you, that's very gracious.

348
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:39,450
Gentlemen.

349
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:45,950
Why couldn't you have just done what Leonard did

350
00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:48,950
and get Penny a new boyfriend?

351
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:53,680
My leg is killing me.

352
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:56,050
Thanks for asking.

353
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:08,920
Okay, I have just one question for you.

354
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:11,720
While I am perfectly happy with the way things are between us,

355
00:15:11,780 --> 00:15:13,120
you said that you didn't want

356
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:15,180
to go out with me because I was too smart for you!

357
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:17,480
Well, news flash, lady

358
00:15:17,550 --> 00:15:19,950
David Underhill is ten times smarter than me!

359
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:22,250
You'd have to drive a railroad spike into his brain

360
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:24,580
for me to beat him at checkers!

361
00:15:24,650 --> 00:15:25,850
Next to him,

362
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:27,980
I'm like one of those sign-language gorillas

363
00:15:28,050 --> 00:15:30,250
who knows how to ask for grapes!

364
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:33,280
So, my question is...

365
00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:36,320
What's up with that?!

366
00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:39,750
Why are you yelling at me?

367
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:41,850
Sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry!

368
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:44,480
Never mind, we're cool.

369
00:15:44,550 --> 00:15:45,950
Dave is not smarter than you.

370
00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:47,250
He's an idiot.

371
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:51,580
Really? Why would you say that?

372
00:15:51,650 --> 00:15:54,050
Because a smart guy takes the nude photos of his wife

373
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:56,480
off his cell phone before he tries to take nude photos

374
00:15:56,550 --> 00:15:59,320
of his girlfriend.

375
00:16:00,350 --> 00:16:01,880
He tried to take nude photos of you?

376
00:16:01,950 --> 00:16:05,820
That's what you took from that?!

377
00:16:07,050 --> 00:16:09,780
The guy is married!

378
00:16:09,850 --> 00:16:11,180
Oh, yeah.

379
00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:14,880
I'm so-- Oh, that's terrible.

380
00:16:14,950 --> 00:16:16,580
And you, if you are so okay

381
00:16:16,650 --> 00:16:17,750
with the way things are between us,

382
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:19,120
why are you so jealous?

383
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:20,450
Well, uh...

384
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:25,780
The important thing is he's married and that's terrible!

385
00:16:27,850 --> 00:16:30,350
Nice save, genius.

386
00:16:30,450 --> 00:16:31,820
Eggnog?

387
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:34,150
Lactose.

388
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:36,180
It's just rum.

389
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:39,620
It stopped being eggnog like half an hour ago.

390
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:46,320
Smooth.

391
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:49,720
Smoother than you.

392
00:16:49,780 --> 00:16:53,380
Come on, it's Christmas, just give me this one.

393
00:16:54,450 --> 00:16:58,280
Okay, Merry Christmas.

394
00:17:02,580 --> 00:17:04,580
By the way, my leg is killing me.

395
00:17:04,650 --> 00:17:07,620
Thanks for asking.

396
00:17:14,580 --> 00:17:16,220
- Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas.

397
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:17,320
How's your leg?

398
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:18,650
Very good, thanks for asking. Come on in.

399
00:17:20,650 --> 00:17:24,620
Ah, good, Penny, you're here to exchange gifts.

400
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:29,180
You'll be pleased to know

401
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:32,550
I'm prepared for whatever you have to offer.

402
00:17:32,620 --> 00:17:34,150
Okay, here.

403
00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:41,550
I should note I'm having some digestive distress,

404
00:17:43,350 --> 00:17:48,150
so, if I excuse myself abruptly, don't be alarmed.

405
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:58,620
Oh, a napkin.

406
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:01,550
Turn it over.

407
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:09,580
"To Sheldon,

408
00:18:09,650 --> 00:18:13,020
"live long and prosper.

409
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:16,320
Leonard Nimoy."

410
00:18:18,020 --> 00:18:20,280
Yeah, he came into the restaurant.

411
00:18:20,350 --> 00:18:22,420
Sorry the napkin's dirty. He wiped his mouth with it.

412
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:32,020
I possess the DNA of Leonard Nimoy?!

413
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:38,520
Well...

414
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:41,180
Yeah, yeah. I guess.

415
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:43,150
But look, he signed it.

416
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:46,080
Do you realize what this means?!

417
00:18:47,380 --> 00:18:49,920
All I need is a healthy ovum

418
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:54,250
and I can grow my own Leonard Nimoy!

419
00:18:57,320 --> 00:19:01,450
Okay, all I'm giving you is the napkin, Sheldon.

420
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:05,620
Be right back.

421
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:09,980
Here. Open it.

422
00:19:12,350 --> 00:19:17,450
Oh, a gift cerficate for motorcycle lessons.

423
00:19:19,350 --> 00:19:21,350
Very thoughtful.

424
00:19:21,420 --> 00:19:22,380
Yeah, and I checked.

425
00:19:22,450 --> 00:19:23,820
Not letting the bike fall on you

426
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:26,850
while standing still is lesson one.

427
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:30,320
Oh, then, I think you'll appreciate what I got you.

428
00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:32,380
Okay.

429
00:19:34,950 --> 00:19:38,920
"101 Totally Cool Science Experiments for Kids."

430
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:46,680
You know, 'cause you're so into science.

431
00:19:56,980 --> 00:19:59,820
Sheldon! What did you do?!

432
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:01,980
I know!

433
00:20:02,050 --> 00:20:04,850
It's not enough, is it?

434
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:09,020
Here.

435
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:25,580
Leonard, look! Sheldon's hugging me.

436
00:20:25,650 --> 00:20:29,050
It's a Saturnalia miracle.
