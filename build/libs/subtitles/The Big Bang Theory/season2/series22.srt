But I didn't spoil anything.

You told me it's mind-blowing,
so my mind is going into it pre-blown.

it cannot be re-blown.

- Sure. What's up?

Remember I went out with Penny
a couple weeks ago?

34
00:01:54,063 --> 00:01:56,725
- Yeah, vaguely.
- Sure, you remember. That was the night...

35
00:01:56,900 --> 00:02:01,030
...you went to the bar and made a fool of
yourself trying to pick up strange women.

00:02:05,875 --> 00:02:09,038
Well, the thing is,
the date didn't go that well.

00:02:09,212 --> 00:02:12,272
Oh. Too bad. You know--

39
00:02:12,482 --> 00:02:15,178
I guess the thing to do now is,
you know, pick yourself up.

40
00:02:15,351 --> 00:02:17,148
Dust yourself off, forget it. Move on.

- Why the hell not?

my last shot with Penny...

- Oh, nobody wants that.

So here's my question:

50
00:02:43,546 --> 00:02:49,178
It's the second date. You think
she'll be expecting things to get physical?

51

Oh, gee.

00:02:54,591 --> 00:02:56,821
Yeah, my initial reaction is no.

But, you know, let me about it
and get back to you, okay?

54
00:03:00,363 --> 00:03:01,990
Okay. So you'll give me a call?

- Yeah, or you call me.
- Great.

00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:36,390
And you know, treat her with, like,
cool detachment.

170
00:09:36,559 --> 00:09:39,960
And, you know, fear.

171
00:09:40,129 --> 00:09:41,460
- Fear?
LEONARD: Yeah.

172
00:09:41,631 --> 00:09:46,659
Like you're afraid
that if you touch her, she'll break.

173
00:09:46,836 --> 00:09:49,999
Well,
that plays right into my wheelhouse.

174
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:53,468
Good, good.
Well, you kids have fun tonight.

175
00:09:53,643 --> 00:09:55,110
Thanks, Leonard.

176
00:09:55,278 --> 00:09:56,870
What is that thing anyway?

177
00:09:58,014 --> 00:09:59,481
You don't know what this is?

178
00:09:59,649 --> 00:10:01,583
- No.
- Good, get out.

179
00:10:05,187 --> 00:10:08,816
Be afraid of Penny. Nice, very crafty.

180
00:10:08,991 --> 00:10:13,724
It wasn't bad advice.
It just wasn't particularly helpful.

181
00:10:14,230 --> 00:10:18,166
For what it's worth, my mother says
that when we deceive for personal gain...

182
00:10:18,334 --> 00:10:20,564
...we make Jesus cry.

183
00:10:27,977 --> 00:10:33,938
All right, what if we use this two-inch PVC
to reinforce the center cross-support?

184
00:10:34,116 --> 00:10:37,483
No good. I mean, it might work
for the Japanese and the Americans...

185
00:10:37,653 --> 00:10:40,679
...but have you seen the size
of the Russians they got up there?

186
00:10:43,259 --> 00:10:48,253
This thing has to hold up
against a hearty potato-based diet.

187
00:10:48,798 --> 00:10:50,493
I feel terrible.

188
00:10:50,666 --> 00:10:53,931
Maybe if you were helping,
you'd feel better about yourself.

189
00:10:54,470 --> 00:10:57,837
I deliberately tried to sabotage
Stuart's date with Penny.

190
00:10:58,007 --> 00:11:01,465
Of course you feel terrible. You completely
screwed up your karma, dude.

191
00:11:01,644 --> 00:11:04,112
You don't really believe in that superstition,
do you?

192
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:07,113
It's not superstition,
it's practically Newtonian.

193
00:11:07,683 --> 00:11:10,117
For every action,
there's an equal and opposite reaction.

194
00:11:10,286 --> 00:11:14,120
Leonard pretends to be a friend,
and acts like a two-faced bitch.

195
00:11:16,158 --> 00:11:19,150
Therefore, he is reborn as a banana slug.

196
00:11:21,630 --> 00:11:25,464
It's actually a very elegant system.
You know, what goes around comes around.

197
00:11:25,634 --> 00:11:28,569
Speaking of what goes around
comes around....

198
00:11:29,238 --> 00:11:30,330
Okay, look.

199
00:11:30,506 --> 00:11:33,270
Instead of trying to reinforce
this structure here...

200
00:11:33,442 --> 00:11:35,876
...what if we ran another line,
bypassed it entirely?

201
00:11:36,045 --> 00:11:38,639
Won't work.
The diameter of the tubing is insufficient.

202
00:11:38,814 --> 00:11:40,805
What if we reposition
the collection tank?

203
00:11:40,983 --> 00:11:42,575
It won't work. No way to mount it.

204
00:11:42,752 --> 00:11:44,845
Here's an idea.
What if I change my name...

205
00:11:45,020 --> 00:11:47,887
...and go live with my cousin
and her husband, Avi, in Israel?

206
00:11:50,126 --> 00:11:51,593
That could work.

207
00:11:57,666 --> 00:11:59,258
- Morning.
- Morning. What's up?

208
00:11:59,435 --> 00:12:04,429
Nothing. We just pulled an all-nighter
trying to fix a Zero-Gravity pasta maker.

209
00:12:06,809 --> 00:12:09,676
- I'm gonna make a coffee run. Want any?
- No. I have coffee.

210
00:12:09,845 --> 00:12:12,211
Great,
so how'd it go with Stuart last night?

211
00:12:14,216 --> 00:12:15,911
I really don't wanna talk about it.

212
00:12:16,085 --> 00:12:17,643
Yeah. Right. Sure.

213
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:20,380
But, you know, the thing is,
before you guys went out...

214
00:12:20,556 --> 00:12:23,354
- I spoke to him and l--
- I said I don't wanna talk about it.

215
00:12:23,526 --> 00:12:25,585
- Okay, I kind of feel res--
- Look, Leonard.

216
00:12:25,761 --> 00:12:29,060
What goes on is none of your business.
So just leave it alone, okay?

217
00:12:33,903 --> 00:12:38,363
If you really want to clean up your karma,
go get my freaking latte.

218
00:12:46,182 --> 00:12:48,514
Hang on, I think I've got this.

219
00:12:48,684 --> 00:12:51,881
Help me see if we can wedge
this piece of PVC behind the support rod.

220
00:12:52,054 --> 00:12:55,717
You're overestimating the strength
of the substructure you're building.

221
00:12:55,891 --> 00:12:59,019
- Sheldon, I know what I'm doing.
- lf you knew what you were doing...

222
00:12:59,195 --> 00:13:02,323
...there wouldn't be a space toilet
where my coffee table should be.

223
00:13:03,732 --> 00:13:05,290
Howard, wait.

224
00:13:05,468 --> 00:13:09,461
Why don't you use this instead of the PVC
to keep the filter assembly in place?

225
00:13:09,738 --> 00:13:12,468
Because this is not a spare part
from the space station.

226
00:13:12,641 --> 00:13:16,941
This is the thing from the pizza box
that keeps the lid from touching the cheese.

227
00:13:17,513 --> 00:13:20,949
Is that what that's for?
In India, the lid just touches the cheese.

228
00:13:21,116 --> 00:13:24,142
We also have rampant poverty
and periodic outbreaks of cholera...

229
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:26,845
...so a little cardboard in our cheese
is no biggie.

230
00:13:29,024 --> 00:13:30,855
- Where you going?
- Comic-book store.

231
00:13:31,026 --> 00:13:33,586
Oh, an excellent idea.
I could certainly use a break.

232
00:13:33,762 --> 00:13:35,923
- Me too.
- You can go to the comic book store...

233
00:13:36,098 --> 00:13:38,362
...when man can once again
safely poop in space.

234
00:13:39,268 --> 00:13:40,701
Why does Leonard get to go?

235
00:13:40,870 --> 00:13:43,134
Because he's upset
over his situation with Penny.

236
00:13:43,305 --> 00:13:47,071
And if I have to hear about it again,
I'm gonna kick him in his ovaries.

237
00:13:47,643 --> 00:13:50,612
- Thanks for understanding, Howard.
HOWARD: I got your back, sister.

238
00:13:51,881 --> 00:13:56,147
All right, I think we've got a prototype
ready to test. Hand me that Tupperware.

239
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:59,317
- That's heavy.
- Damn right, it's heavy.

240
00:13:59,488 --> 00:14:00,785
It's my mother's meatloaf.

241
00:14:02,124 --> 00:14:05,252
It's been testing toilets for generations.

242
00:14:05,995 --> 00:14:07,019
I must say, Howard...

243
00:14:07,196 --> 00:14:10,688
...I think a detailed letter to MIT
describing your current circumstances...

244
00:14:10,866 --> 00:14:14,029
...might entitle you to a refund
on your Master's degree.

245
00:14:15,170 --> 00:14:20,130
Okay, simulated zero-gravity human waste
disposal test with meatloaf analog.

246
00:14:21,510 --> 00:14:24,343
In three, two, one.

247
00:14:30,586 --> 00:14:32,918
Fascinating.

248
00:14:34,023 --> 00:14:36,014
What do you think the problem is?

249
00:14:36,191 --> 00:14:38,887
Not enough bread crumbs.

250
00:14:45,634 --> 00:14:48,364
- Hey, Stuart, I need to talk to you.
- Sure, what's up?

251
00:14:48,537 --> 00:14:51,836
I think I gave you some bad advice
about Penny and I want to apologize.

252
00:14:52,007 --> 00:14:53,235
No, your advice was great.

253
00:14:53,409 --> 00:14:55,843
- It was?
- Oh, yeah, going slow really worked.

254
00:14:56,345 --> 00:14:57,937
You're kidding.

255
00:14:58,447 --> 00:15:00,506
Never worked for me.

256
00:15:00,683 --> 00:15:03,015
Yeah, last night at dinner
I did what you told me.

257
00:15:03,185 --> 00:15:05,949
I went really slow, I kept my distance...

258
00:15:06,121 --> 00:15:08,112
...and two bottles of wine later,
we were making out in my car.

259
00:15:09,158 --> 00:15:12,685
Wine? I didn't say to give her wine.

260
00:15:13,228 --> 00:15:15,628
It doesn't matter.
That's where it all went to hell.

261
00:15:15,798 --> 00:15:17,060
During the kissing?

262
00:15:17,232 --> 00:15:21,168
What did you do, sneeze in her mouth?
I did that to a girl once.

263
00:15:22,404 --> 00:15:25,305
No, everything was good and really hot.

264
00:15:25,474 --> 00:15:28,443
And I said, oh, Penny...

265
00:15:28,611 --> 00:15:32,069
...and right where she was supposed
to say, "Oh, Stuart" she said...

266
00:15:33,382 --> 00:15:35,077
...your name.

267
00:15:39,888 --> 00:15:41,617
- Leonard?
- That is your name, right?

268
00:15:41,790 --> 00:15:44,156
Yeah. No, yeah, it is.

269
00:15:44,326 --> 00:15:45,918
Wow, I'm sorry.

270
00:15:46,095 --> 00:15:48,529
That must've been the last thing
you wanted to hear.

271
00:15:48,697 --> 00:15:52,997
Well, it beats,
"You know I'm a dude, right?"

272
00:15:55,170 --> 00:15:57,070
Yeah, it was pretty bad.

273
00:15:57,706 --> 00:15:59,674
No doubt, no doubt.

274
00:16:02,411 --> 00:16:03,776
Okay, well...

275
00:16:03,946 --> 00:16:06,847
- ...l'm sorry it didn't work out.
- Not your fault.

276
00:16:07,282 --> 00:16:08,977
Yeah, how about that?

277
00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:14,418
- See you soon.
- Yep, sure.

278
00:16:28,704 --> 00:16:31,605
Yes, I understand. Classified.
We'll keep it all classified.

279
00:16:31,774 --> 00:16:34,242
No one has to know anything about this
but you and me.

280
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:35,502
What's classified?

281
00:16:35,878 --> 00:16:38,779
Howard's space toilet. I'll tell you later.

282
00:16:39,982 --> 00:16:44,646
Well, they've deployed our solution.
Let's just all hope it works.

283
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:46,617
I don't see why I have to worry.

284
00:16:46,789 --> 00:16:50,088
My career's not hanging in the balance.

285
00:16:55,798 --> 00:16:57,732
That was a joke.

286
00:16:57,900 --> 00:17:01,631
It's funny because it's true.

287
00:17:05,307 --> 00:17:07,741
Leonard,
could you pass the soy sauce, please?

288
00:17:07,910 --> 00:17:11,038
- I'm sorry, were you talking to me?
- Yeah, I said Leonard.

289
00:17:12,047 --> 00:17:14,208
Yes, you did, didn't you?

290
00:17:21,023 --> 00:17:22,513
What the hell is that?

291
00:17:23,225 --> 00:17:24,817
Meatloaf.

292
00:17:25,994 --> 00:17:27,655
What was it doing on the ceiling?

293
00:17:28,497 --> 00:17:30,397
That's classified.
