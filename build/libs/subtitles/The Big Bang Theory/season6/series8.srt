1
00:00:03,642 --> 00:00:04,989
What are you drawing
over there?

2
00:00:04,990 --> 00:00:07,541
A hypothetical containment field

3
00:00:07,543 --> 00:00:09,593
for a Frisbee-sized wormhole

4
00:00:09,595 --> 00:00:12,663
that could serve as a portal
to a parallel universe.

5
00:00:12,665 --> 00:00:15,832
Oh, you silly doodlebug.

6
00:00:17,185 --> 00:00:18,685
You know,
a lot of scientists believe

7
00:00:18,687 --> 00:00:20,354
that making contact
with other life-forms

8
00:00:20,356 --> 00:00:22,306
would probably not
end well for us.

9
00:00:22,308 --> 00:00:24,691
It's a Frisbee-sized wormhole,
Leonard.

10
00:00:24,693 --> 00:00:26,276
You can block it with a Frisbee.

11
00:00:26,278 --> 00:00:27,528
Calm down.

12
00:00:30,732 --> 00:00:32,983
Do you expect me
to build this?

13
00:00:32,985 --> 00:00:35,619
I expect you to wipe the pudding
off your chin. Gentlemen.

14
00:00:38,123 --> 00:00:39,706
Have you guys ever noticed
that Sheldon

15
00:00:39,708 --> 00:00:42,376
always disappears every day
at 2:45?

16
00:00:42,378 --> 00:00:43,410
Really?

17
00:00:43,412 --> 00:00:44,745
He probably just goes
to the bathroom.

18
00:00:44,747 --> 00:00:46,196
Actually, no,
he goes to the bathroom

19
00:00:46,198 --> 00:00:47,915
at 8:00 a.m.
with optional follow-ups

20
00:00:47,917 --> 00:00:52,035
at 1:45 and 7:10
on high-fiber Fridays.

21
00:00:52,804 --> 00:00:54,671
It's sad that
you know that.

22
00:00:54,673 --> 00:00:57,841
Oh, that's just the tip
of the sadness iceberg.

23
00:00:58,726 --> 00:01:01,895
I'm looking
at his public calendar.

24
00:01:01,897 --> 00:01:05,098
2:45 to 3:05, nothing.

25
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:07,401
Yesterday, 2:45 to 3:05,
nothing.

26
00:01:07,403 --> 00:01:08,936
Last week, nothing.

27
00:01:08,938 --> 00:01:10,087
Last month, nothing.

28
00:01:10,089 --> 00:01:12,823
He never has anything booked
during that time.

29
00:01:12,825 --> 00:01:15,859
20 minutes a day,
completely unaccounted for.

30
00:01:15,861 --> 00:01:17,895
We should figure out
where he goes.

31
00:01:17,897 --> 00:01:19,896
Ooh, this is exciting.

32
00:01:20,765 --> 00:01:21,832
Like one of my classic

33
00:01:21,834 --> 00:01:23,617
murder mystery
dinner parties.

34
00:01:23,619 --> 00:01:25,619
Right, the case of
who murdered

35
00:01:25,621 --> 00:01:27,621
three Saturday nights
of my life?

36
00:01:28,957 --> 00:01:30,457
Colonel Koothrapali
in ten

37
00:01:30,459 --> 00:01:32,676
with the olive spread.

38
00:01:33,962 --> 00:01:37,297
It was tapenade
and you guys suck.

39
00:01:37,299 --> 00:01:40,951
? Our whole universe
was in a hot, dense state ?

40
00:01:40,953 --> 00:01:44,271
? Then nearly 14 billion years
ago expansion started... Wait! ?

41
00:01:44,273 --> 00:01:45,922
? The Earth began to cool

42
00:01:45,924 --> 00:01:48,458
? The autotrophs began to drool,
Neanderthals developed tools ?

43
00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:51,111
? We built the Wall
? <i>We built the pyramids</i> ?

44
00:01:51,113 --> 00:01:53,797
? Math, Science, History,
unraveling the mystery ?

45
00:01:53,799 --> 00:01:55,699
? That all started
with a big bang ?

46
00:01:55,701 --> 00:01:57,668
? <i>Bang!</i> ?

47
00:01:57,669 --> 00:02:01,669

49
00:02:06,663 --> 00:02:07,930
So, how was work today?

50
00:02:07,931 --> 00:02:09,797
Well, I spent most
of the afternoon growing

51
00:02:09,799 --> 00:02:12,800
isotopically pure crystals
for neutrino detection.

52
00:02:14,586 --> 00:02:17,455
That sounds like fun.

53
00:02:17,457 --> 00:02:18,856
Yeah, it was.

54
00:02:18,858 --> 00:02:20,858
Oh, good, I guessed right.

55
00:02:22,696 --> 00:02:24,345
Who you talking to?

56
00:02:24,347 --> 00:02:26,114
Oh, just this guy
I met at school.

57
00:02:26,116 --> 00:02:29,016
Oh, great.
We're still dating, right?

58
00:02:29,018 --> 00:02:31,736
Relax. He's just a friend.

59
00:02:31,738 --> 00:02:33,071
We're doing
an oral report together.

60
00:02:33,073 --> 00:02:34,288
He's really nice.

61
00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:35,206
I'm sorry, what was that?

62
00:02:35,208 --> 00:02:37,742
I had a little stroke
after "oral."

63
00:02:37,744 --> 00:02:39,744
Would you stop?

64
00:02:40,830 --> 00:02:42,547
Look, he just moved here
from London, okay?

65
00:02:42,549 --> 00:02:43,698
He doesn't really know anybody.

66
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:45,917
Oh, good, an English accent,

67
00:02:45,919 --> 00:02:47,368
the sexiest accent you can have.

68
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:48,586
No.

69
00:02:48,588 --> 00:02:49,870
That's not true.

70
00:02:49,872 --> 00:02:52,557
There's French, there's Italian.

71
00:02:52,559 --> 00:02:55,543
No, you're right, it's the best.

72
00:02:55,545 --> 00:02:57,178
Did you tell him
you have a boyfriend?

73
00:02:57,180 --> 00:02:58,429
It didn't come up.

74
00:02:58,431 --> 00:03:00,148
Well, maybe you should tell him.

75
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:01,933
What am I supposed to say?

76
00:03:01,935 --> 00:03:03,217
Say, "Can't talk right now.

77
00:03:03,219 --> 00:03:04,385
"Hanging with my boyfriend.

78
00:03:04,387 --> 00:03:06,721
England sucks, you suck,
USA number one."

79
00:03:10,693 --> 00:03:11,892
Fine.

80
00:03:11,894 --> 00:03:13,611
"Hanging with my boyfriend.

81
00:03:13,613 --> 00:03:15,530
Talk to you later."

82
00:03:15,532 --> 00:03:16,664
Happy?

83
00:03:16,666 --> 00:03:18,032
Yes. Thank you.
Mm-hmm.

84
00:03:24,373 --> 00:03:25,790
What did he say?

85
00:03:25,792 --> 00:03:27,241
Nothing.

86
00:03:27,243 --> 00:03:28,509
What?

87
00:03:28,511 --> 00:03:31,679
"Did your boyfriend make
you type that?"

88
00:03:38,721 --> 00:03:40,888
I hate this guy.

89
00:03:42,975 --> 00:03:46,093
Don't be like that.

90
00:03:46,095 --> 00:03:48,095
Come on, trust me,
he's hitting on you.

91
00:03:48,097 --> 00:03:49,363
No, he's not.
We're just friends.

92
00:03:49,365 --> 00:03:50,782
Look, is this gonna be
a problem?

93
00:03:50,784 --> 00:03:52,533
Because he's supposed
to come over tomorrow to work.

94
00:03:52,535 --> 00:03:54,368
Really? Here?

95
00:03:54,370 --> 00:03:56,437
If it makes you uncomfortable,
I'll switch partners,

96
00:03:56,439 --> 00:03:58,156
even though
the thing's due next week

97
00:03:58,158 --> 00:04:00,074
and everyone already
has a partner

98
00:04:00,076 --> 00:04:02,109
and I'll probably end up
failing the class.

99
00:04:02,111 --> 00:04:03,711
That'd be great. Thank you.

100
00:04:08,584 --> 00:04:10,468
2:44,
right on schedule.

101
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:11,669
Hey, Sheldon.

102
00:04:11,671 --> 00:04:13,287
Oh, hello.

103
00:04:13,289 --> 00:04:15,456
Raj and I
are heading over

104
00:04:15,458 --> 00:04:18,426
to the genetics lab to pet
the glow-in-the-dark bunny.

105
00:04:19,178 --> 00:04:21,062
Want to come with us?
No, thank you.

106
00:04:21,064 --> 00:04:22,597
Are you sure? They
turn off the lights,

107
00:04:22,599 --> 00:04:23,981
and it's like a cute
little laser show

108
00:04:23,983 --> 00:04:26,184
that poops all
over the place.

109
00:04:26,186 --> 00:04:28,603
I'm quite sure. Good day.

110
00:04:28,605 --> 00:04:30,104
Well, where
are you going?

111
00:04:30,106 --> 00:04:31,656
Where are you going?
We just told you.

112
00:04:31,658 --> 00:04:33,357
I just told you.
No, you didn't.

113
00:04:33,359 --> 00:04:35,860
Well, it's your word against
mine; see you in court.

114
00:04:38,497 --> 00:04:41,082
Should we follow him?

115
00:04:41,084 --> 00:04:42,200
I don't know, I'm torn.

116
00:04:42,202 --> 00:04:43,417
I want to know
where he's going,

117
00:04:43,419 --> 00:04:45,837
but now I kind of want
to play with the bunny.

118
00:04:46,672 --> 00:04:48,673
Hi, guys.

119
00:04:48,675 --> 00:04:50,842
Hey, Alex, do you know
where your boss just went?

120
00:04:50,844 --> 00:04:51,709
No.

121
00:04:51,711 --> 00:04:52,827
Don't you know
his schedule?

122
00:04:52,829 --> 00:04:55,429
All I know is corduroy
makes too much noise

123
00:04:55,431 --> 00:04:57,632
and I have to go find
"quieter pants."

124
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:03,437
Come on.

125
00:05:03,439 --> 00:05:05,306
Boy, what I wouldn't give

126
00:05:05,308 --> 00:05:07,892
to get her out of those pants...

127
00:05:07,894 --> 00:05:10,344
and into something
a little more stylish.

128
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:18,074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

129
00:05:24,910 --> 00:05:26,694
This is where
he goes?

130
00:05:26,696 --> 00:05:28,496
What's in there?

131
00:05:28,498 --> 00:05:30,081
I think it's
an old storage room.

132
00:05:30,083 --> 00:05:34,468
What could he be doing in there
every day for 20 minutes?

133
00:05:34,470 --> 00:05:36,420
Well, he's not doing
20-minute abs,

134
00:05:36,422 --> 00:05:39,640
because if he were,
he would have way better abs.

135
00:05:42,311 --> 00:05:44,395
Can you hear anything?

136
00:05:44,397 --> 00:05:46,848
Not yet.

137
00:05:58,327 --> 00:06:00,928
What are you doing?

138
00:06:00,930 --> 00:06:03,197
I'm listening.

139
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:06,534
Can't you face the
other way and listen?

140
00:06:06,536 --> 00:06:09,570
I can't do anything right
for you, can I?

141
00:06:09,572 --> 00:06:11,806
What the hell
is he up to?

142
00:06:11,808 --> 00:06:14,425
He is kind of a weirdo.

143
00:06:14,427 --> 00:06:17,044
Maybe he's got Leonard Nimoy
chained up in there.

144
00:06:17,046 --> 00:06:18,462
Or Bill Gates.

145
00:06:18,464 --> 00:06:20,598
Or Stephen Hawking.

146
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:24,802
Why would he chain
up Stephen Hawking?

147
00:06:24,804 --> 00:06:27,305
Howard, please, you can't treat
the man differently

148
00:06:27,307 --> 00:06:30,057
just because he's disabled.
That's not okay.

149
00:06:32,694 --> 00:06:35,262
If you're wondering why

150
00:06:35,264 --> 00:06:36,597
I've been staring
through the peephole,

151
00:06:36,599 --> 00:06:38,316
I'm trying to get a look
at this guy

152
00:06:38,318 --> 00:06:39,951
who's coming over to Penny's.

153
00:06:39,953 --> 00:06:44,038
To be honest,
I didn't know you were here.

154
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:46,274
It's not a big deal.

155
00:06:46,276 --> 00:06:47,541
He's just in her history class.

156
00:06:47,543 --> 00:06:49,076
They're working
on a project together.

157
00:06:49,078 --> 00:06:50,578
I don't even know why I care.

158
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:51,746
You know what, I don't care.

159
00:06:51,748 --> 00:06:54,348
You think <i>you</i> don't care.

160
00:06:54,350 --> 00:06:56,801
This is silly.

161
00:06:56,803 --> 00:06:59,003
I have nothing
to worry about.

162
00:06:59,005 --> 00:07:02,957
Oh, I don't know.

163
00:07:02,959 --> 00:07:04,225
Statistically speaking,

164
00:07:04,227 --> 00:07:06,410
I'm sure you have something
to worry about.

165
00:07:06,412 --> 00:07:08,128
What do you mean?

166
00:07:08,130 --> 00:07:12,099
Well, if we assume
your looks are average,

167
00:07:12,101 --> 00:07:13,801
right off the bat,

168
00:07:13,803 --> 00:07:16,938
50% of men on Earth
are more attractive than you.

169
00:07:19,074 --> 00:07:22,476
That's 1.5 billion
handsome lads standing by,

170
00:07:22,478 --> 00:07:24,912
waiting to rain on your parade.

171
00:07:24,914 --> 00:07:28,833
Well, yeah, but this
isn't just about looks.

172
00:07:28,835 --> 00:07:32,286
I'm way above average
in a lot of other things.

173
00:07:32,288 --> 00:07:34,288
Not height, vision, athleticism,

174
00:07:34,290 --> 00:07:37,825
or ability
to digest dairy products.

175
00:07:37,827 --> 00:07:40,160
I'm talking
about important things

176
00:07:40,162 --> 00:07:43,014
like emotional maturity.

177
00:07:43,016 --> 00:07:46,434
You were just spying on your
girlfriend through a peephole.

178
00:07:46,436 --> 00:07:49,503
I liked it better
when you thought I wasn't here.

179
00:07:49,505 --> 00:07:53,391
I'm not saying you don't
have attractive qualities.

180
00:07:53,393 --> 00:07:55,860
Your choice of friends
is impeccable,

181
00:07:55,862 --> 00:07:57,812
you're a good sleeper.

182
00:07:57,814 --> 00:07:59,814
And last but not least,

183
00:07:59,816 --> 00:08:03,401
you buy the grapes I like.

184
00:08:03,403 --> 00:08:05,703
You're a real catch

185
00:08:05,705 --> 00:08:07,488
compared to some snoring guy

186
00:08:07,490 --> 00:08:10,624
with a fridge full
of lousy grapes.

187
00:08:10,626 --> 00:08:12,793
None of this matters.

188
00:08:12,795 --> 00:08:14,545
I trust that Penny cares
about me,

189
00:08:14,547 --> 00:08:16,630
and nothing's gonna happen
with this guy.

190
00:08:16,632 --> 00:08:20,001
Well, unless of course
he's a skilled hypnotist.

191
00:08:20,003 --> 00:08:22,720
What?

192
00:08:22,722 --> 00:08:26,073
While unlikely, it's still
a statistical possibility.

193
00:08:26,075 --> 00:08:27,241
She might be performing

194
00:08:27,243 --> 00:08:31,262
sexual acts with him
and not even know it.

195
00:08:31,264 --> 00:08:34,381
Now you're just being
ridiculous.

196
00:08:34,383 --> 00:08:35,816
Am I?

197
00:08:35,818 --> 00:08:38,069
The mind's
a mysterious thing, Leonard.

198
00:08:38,071 --> 00:08:40,671
He could be having
the time of his life

199
00:08:40,673 --> 00:08:43,908
while she thinks she's
a chicken pecking for corn.

200
00:08:54,503 --> 00:08:57,571
Look at us, sneaking around
in the middle of the night

201
00:08:57,573 --> 00:09:01,292
like a couple
of cat burglars.

202
00:09:01,294 --> 00:09:03,177
I think we're more
like ninjas.

203
00:09:03,179 --> 00:09:06,413
I don't want to be a ninja;
I want to be a cat burglar.

204
00:09:06,415 --> 00:09:09,884
Fine, I'll be a ninja,
you be a cat burglar.

205
00:09:09,886 --> 00:09:12,019
No, we both have to
be the same thing.

206
00:09:14,089 --> 00:09:16,590
Okay, we're ninjas.

207
00:09:16,592 --> 00:09:18,142
Thank you.

208
00:09:18,144 --> 00:09:21,062
But next time, we'll
be cat burglars.

209
00:09:27,285 --> 00:09:29,320
It's locked.
Are you sure?

210
00:09:29,322 --> 00:09:31,822
Yes, I'm sure.

211
00:09:31,824 --> 00:09:33,774
Now, you stand guard,
I'm going to...

212
00:09:36,995 --> 00:09:40,164
It's locked.

213
00:09:40,166 --> 00:09:41,949
Just keep an eye out.

214
00:09:41,951 --> 00:09:43,801
I'll have this open
in a minute.

215
00:09:43,803 --> 00:09:45,970
When did you learn
how to pick locks?

216
00:09:45,972 --> 00:09:48,556
When I was starting to do magic
in junior high,

217
00:09:48,558 --> 00:09:51,592
I thought I could be
an escape artist

218
00:09:51,594 --> 00:09:53,394
like Harry Houdini.

219
00:09:53,396 --> 00:09:54,395
How did that work out?

220
00:09:54,397 --> 00:09:55,513
Pretty good.

221
00:09:55,515 --> 00:09:57,264
I managed to escape friends,
popularity,

222
00:09:57,266 --> 00:10:00,634
and every party thrown
in a 12-mile radius.

223
00:10:00,636 --> 00:10:02,736
There. Ready?

224
00:10:02,738 --> 00:10:04,522
Hold on, hold on.
What?

225
00:10:04,524 --> 00:10:06,690
Sheldon is a very smart man,

226
00:10:06,692 --> 00:10:08,943
and he obviously wants
to keep this a secret.

227
00:10:08,945 --> 00:10:10,027
Yeah, so?

228
00:10:10,029 --> 00:10:12,830
What if it's
booby-trapped?

229
00:10:12,832 --> 00:10:16,834
Don't worry, I'm one
step ahead of him.

230
00:10:16,836 --> 00:10:18,652
Great, what's your pl...

231
00:10:23,675 --> 00:10:25,176
Are we good?

232
00:10:25,178 --> 00:10:27,645
Yeah.

233
00:10:34,386 --> 00:10:36,003
Huh.

234
00:10:36,005 --> 00:10:37,721
Forty-three.

235
00:10:37,723 --> 00:10:40,674
What the hell
does that mean?

236
00:10:40,676 --> 00:10:42,026
I don't know.

237
00:10:42,028 --> 00:10:44,011
The solution to an equation?

238
00:10:44,013 --> 00:10:45,446
Maybe.

239
00:10:45,448 --> 00:10:46,981
It's a prime number.

240
00:10:46,983 --> 00:10:50,951
Encryption systems
are built on prime numbers.

241
00:10:50,953 --> 00:10:53,904
What kind of secret does
Sheldon have to encrypt?

242
00:10:53,906 --> 00:10:55,122
He's always been
very cagey

243
00:10:55,124 --> 00:10:57,158
about what he puts
in his egg salad

244
00:10:57,160 --> 00:11:00,327
to make it so tasty.

245
00:11:02,147 --> 00:11:05,499
It's paprika.

246
00:11:05,501 --> 00:11:06,917
Really?

247
00:11:06,919 --> 00:11:09,086
Well, okay, one mystery solved.

248
00:11:11,973 --> 00:11:13,657
Okay, good night.

249
00:11:13,659 --> 00:11:14,808
Thanks, Cole.

250
00:11:14,810 --> 00:11:15,809
See you at school.

251
00:11:15,811 --> 00:11:17,144
See you.

252
00:11:18,414 --> 00:11:20,814
I'll be right back.

253
00:11:20,816 --> 00:11:23,417
I thought you left
a long time ago.

254
00:11:33,111 --> 00:11:34,728
What's up?

255
00:11:34,730 --> 00:11:37,031
Hey.

256
00:11:37,033 --> 00:11:41,418
You moving into the apartment
on the fifth floor?

257
00:11:41,420 --> 00:11:44,071
No, I was just visiting
a friend.

258
00:11:44,073 --> 00:11:45,339
Oh, cool.

259
00:11:45,341 --> 00:11:46,707
That cute blonde on four?

260
00:11:46,709 --> 00:11:48,092
Yeah. You know her?

261
00:11:48,094 --> 00:11:49,960
I, well,
I see her around.

262
00:11:49,962 --> 00:11:52,096
I like to keep my distance

263
00:11:52,098 --> 00:11:55,766
because her boyfriend
is a pretty scary dude.

264
00:11:55,768 --> 00:11:57,301
Really?

265
00:11:57,303 --> 00:11:59,086
Yeah.

266
00:11:59,088 --> 00:12:02,256
He's ganged up.

267
00:12:02,258 --> 00:12:04,308
She told me
he's a scientist.

268
00:12:04,310 --> 00:12:07,695
That's the name of his gang.

269
00:12:08,546 --> 00:12:12,316
The Scientists.

270
00:12:12,318 --> 00:12:15,653
They are crazy.

271
00:12:15,655 --> 00:12:17,538
Well, thanks for the tip.

272
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:20,107
No problem, brother.
Stay frosty.

273
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:34,238
We're still dating, right?

274
00:12:47,091 --> 00:12:48,241
Oh, hello, Dr. Hofstadter.

275
00:12:48,243 --> 00:12:50,293
Hey, Alex,
and call me Leonard.

276
00:12:50,295 --> 00:12:51,812
Dr. Hofstadter is my father.

277
00:12:51,814 --> 00:12:53,330
And my mother.

278
00:12:54,348 --> 00:12:55,849
And my sister.

279
00:12:55,851 --> 00:12:58,685
And our cat.

280
00:12:59,887 --> 00:13:01,388
Although, I'm pretty sure

281
00:13:01,390 --> 00:13:04,808
Dr. Boots Hofstadter's degree
was honorary.

282
00:13:04,810 --> 00:13:07,427
May I join you, Leonard?

283
00:13:07,429 --> 00:13:09,279
Sure.
Thanks.

284
00:13:09,281 --> 00:13:11,698
Hey, Alex,
let me ask you something.

285
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:14,484
My girlfriend
knows this guy at school.

286
00:13:14,486 --> 00:13:16,486
He's got an English accent.

287
00:13:16,488 --> 00:13:18,455
Ooh, I love English accents.

288
00:13:18,457 --> 00:13:21,241
Yeah, you all do.

289
00:13:21,243 --> 00:13:24,044
Anyway, I feel like
he's hitting on her.

290
00:13:24,046 --> 00:13:27,113
She says he's just being nice
and that I should trust her.

291
00:13:27,115 --> 00:13:28,665
It's probably harmless.

292
00:13:28,667 --> 00:13:29,833
You know how it is.

293
00:13:29,835 --> 00:13:32,803
I'm sure you get hit on
all the time.

294
00:13:33,638 --> 00:13:36,356
Right.

295
00:13:36,358 --> 00:13:38,258
Because girls are always like,

296
00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:40,343
"Ooh, that guy owns
two Star Trek uniforms

297
00:13:40,345 --> 00:13:42,012
"and gets a lot
of ear infections.

298
00:13:42,014 --> 00:13:44,764
I got to get me some of that."

299
00:13:44,766 --> 00:13:46,933
I don't know,

300
00:13:46,935 --> 00:13:48,652
I bet it happens
more than you realize.

301
00:13:48,654 --> 00:13:50,070
Trust me, it doesn't.

302
00:13:50,072 --> 00:13:51,605
You sure?

303
00:13:51,607 --> 00:13:53,490
You're cute, you're funny.

304
00:13:53,492 --> 00:13:58,111
Maybe you're getting hit on,
and you don't even know it.

305
00:13:58,113 --> 00:13:59,579
Really?

306
00:13:59,581 --> 00:14:03,200
I'm pretty sure.

307
00:14:08,923 --> 00:14:10,173
Okay, I got to get back to work.

308
00:14:10,175 --> 00:14:12,726
Thanks for listening.

309
00:14:12,728 --> 00:14:14,094
No problem.

310
00:14:14,096 --> 00:14:16,996
Hope-hope no girls rip my
clothes off on the way.

311
00:14:20,384 --> 00:14:23,570
Come on,
we're smart guys.

312
00:14:23,572 --> 00:14:25,505
We can figure this out.
Forty-three.

313
00:14:25,507 --> 00:14:28,108
What is 43?

314
00:14:28,110 --> 00:14:32,028
Besides my mom's neck size.

315
00:14:33,948 --> 00:14:36,483
It's the atomic number
for technetium.

316
00:14:36,485 --> 00:14:38,685
That stuff's radioactive.

317
00:14:38,687 --> 00:14:41,071
Do you think
he's building a bomb?

318
00:14:41,073 --> 00:14:42,989
It took him two years
to put together

319
00:14:42,991 --> 00:14:44,624
that Lego Death Star;
I'm not worried.

320
00:14:46,377 --> 00:14:49,095
Ooh, this could be something.

321
00:14:49,097 --> 00:14:51,464
43 is the number of calories

322
00:14:51,466 --> 00:14:55,168
in half a cup
of fat-free yogurt.

323
00:14:55,170 --> 00:14:57,671
Why would you know that?

324
00:14:57,673 --> 00:14:59,038
I'm sorry.

325
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:02,609
We can't all eat whatever
we want and still stay thin.

326
00:15:06,214 --> 00:15:08,515
Wait, in the <i>Hitchhikers</i>
<i>Guide to the Galaxy,</i>

327
00:15:08,517 --> 00:15:10,350
isn't 43 the answer
to the question

328
00:15:10,352 --> 00:15:12,552
of life, the universe,
and everything?

329
00:15:12,554 --> 00:15:15,488
That's 42, dumb-ass.

330
00:15:15,490 --> 00:15:17,023
Hey, hey.

331
00:15:17,025 --> 00:15:19,276
Feelings.

332
00:15:19,278 --> 00:15:22,062
We should stop.

333
00:15:22,064 --> 00:15:24,030
I'm exhausted.
Yeah, me, too.

334
00:15:24,032 --> 00:15:25,599
We've got more
important things to do.

335
00:15:25,601 --> 00:15:27,400
Who cares what
stupid 43 means?

336
00:15:27,402 --> 00:15:29,569
Not me.
Let's go home.

337
00:15:31,372 --> 00:15:32,973
You want
to get something to eat?

338
00:15:32,975 --> 00:15:35,041
Sounds good.

339
00:15:36,910 --> 00:15:38,795
What the balls is 43?!

340
00:15:38,797 --> 00:15:40,931
I have to know!

341
00:15:45,269 --> 00:15:46,603
Hi.

342
00:15:46,605 --> 00:15:49,723
Hey, shouldn't you be out
with your gang,

343
00:15:49,725 --> 00:15:53,026
spray painting equations
on the side of buildings?

344
00:15:53,028 --> 00:15:55,862
Come on, I'm sorry.

345
00:15:55,864 --> 00:15:57,530
I just can't believe
you don't trust me.

346
00:15:57,532 --> 00:15:58,902
I do, of course I do.

347
00:15:58,927 --> 00:16:01,027
Then why did you embarrass me
in front of my friend,

348
00:16:01,069 --> 00:16:03,119
who, by the way,
knew exactly who you were?

349
00:16:03,121 --> 00:16:06,790
Really?
Your picture's on my refrigerator.

350
00:16:08,609 --> 00:16:10,126
Oh.

351
00:16:10,128 --> 00:16:13,330
You know, I'm really starting
to not like this guy.

352
00:16:13,332 --> 00:16:14,947
What is your problem?

353
00:16:14,949 --> 00:16:16,883
Do you use up
all your thinking at work

354
00:16:16,885 --> 00:16:19,002
and then have none left over
for when you get home?

355
00:16:19,004 --> 00:16:20,553
I don't know.

356
00:16:20,555 --> 00:16:23,122
It's hard sometimes.

357
00:16:23,124 --> 00:16:24,474
Everywhere you go,

358
00:16:24,476 --> 00:16:27,394
guys hit on you, even if
I'm standing right there.

359
00:16:27,396 --> 00:16:28,595
And they're all taller than me.

360
00:16:28,597 --> 00:16:31,181
Why is everyone taller
than me?

361
00:16:31,183 --> 00:16:33,099
You know what,

362
00:16:33,101 --> 00:16:34,684
this is all in my head.

363
00:16:34,686 --> 00:16:36,519
It's my problem, not yours.

364
00:16:36,521 --> 00:16:38,071
Leonard, why do you
always do this?

365
00:16:38,073 --> 00:16:39,823
Listen to me,
you're the one I'm with.

366
00:16:39,825 --> 00:16:42,158
You know I love you,
so will you please relax

367
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:43,994
because you're driving me crazy.

368
00:16:50,925 --> 00:16:53,894
You know that's the first time
you ever said that you love me.

369
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:57,881
Yeah.

370
00:17:00,885 --> 00:17:04,538
We're just supposed to
pretend it's not a big deal?

371
00:17:06,474 --> 00:17:09,076
That's...

372
00:17:09,078 --> 00:17:12,812
exactly what we're gonna do
because...

373
00:17:12,814 --> 00:17:15,115
you're about to make me cry,

374
00:17:15,117 --> 00:17:18,035
and we both know
if I start crying,

375
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:21,488
you're gonna start crying.

376
00:17:21,490 --> 00:17:23,924
You're right, you should go.

377
00:17:23,926 --> 00:17:26,043
All right.

378
00:17:32,717 --> 00:17:35,001
She loves me.

379
00:17:39,023 --> 00:17:40,941
"Hey, it's Alex.

380
00:17:40,943 --> 00:17:42,259
"Nice having coffee with you.

381
00:17:42,261 --> 00:17:44,161
"If you want to talk more,
I'm always available.

382
00:17:44,163 --> 00:17:46,146
Smiley face, smiley face."

383
00:17:46,148 --> 00:17:48,348
What a friendly girl.

384
00:17:53,054 --> 00:17:55,238
Okay, picture's up.

385
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:56,990
Looks like the camera's working.

386
00:17:56,992 --> 00:17:58,458
That's good quality video.

387
00:17:58,460 --> 00:18:01,778
It better be. It's the spare
camera for the Mars rover.

388
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:04,081
How did you get
your hands on that?

389
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:05,832
Million dollar camera--

390
00:18:05,834 --> 00:18:07,801
ten dollar lock.

391
00:18:08,753 --> 00:18:10,837
Oh, my God,
here he comes.

392
00:18:10,839 --> 00:18:12,723
This is it.

393
00:18:21,182 --> 00:18:22,816
What the hell
is that thing?

394
00:18:22,818 --> 00:18:24,000
I don't know.

395
00:18:24,002 --> 00:18:25,552
This is Dr. Sheldon Cooper.

396
00:18:25,554 --> 00:18:27,504
Experimental log.

397
00:18:27,506 --> 00:18:32,275
Wormhole generator test 44.

398
00:18:32,277 --> 00:18:35,278
Wormhole generator test?

399
00:18:38,332 --> 00:18:41,451
The first 43 parallel universes

400
00:18:41,453 --> 00:18:44,704
I've checked proved to be empty.

401
00:18:44,706 --> 00:18:46,373
I see no reason to suspect

402
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:49,626
universe number 44
will be any different.

403
00:18:55,266 --> 00:18:57,083
Oh, my God!

404
00:18:57,085 --> 00:18:59,919
Holy crap!

405
00:19:05,526 --> 00:19:08,311
Oh! It's eating my face!

406
00:19:08,313 --> 00:19:09,946
Aah! It's eating his face!

407
00:19:16,442 --> 00:19:18,794
I found your Webcam
and replaced the video feed.

408
00:19:18,796 --> 00:19:21,330
You two should be ashamed
of yourselves.

409
00:19:21,332 --> 00:19:23,015
Sheldon, we're really sorry.

410
00:19:23,017 --> 00:19:24,300
Yeah, really sorry.

411
00:19:24,302 --> 00:19:25,534
Sorry?

412
00:19:25,536 --> 00:19:26,919
You may not realize it,

413
00:19:26,921 --> 00:19:30,472
but I have difficulty navigating
certain aspects of daily life.

414
00:19:30,474 --> 00:19:33,258
You know,
understanding sarcasm,

415
00:19:33,260 --> 00:19:34,760
feigning interest in others,

416
00:19:34,762 --> 00:19:38,731
not talking about trains
as much as I want to.

417
00:19:38,733 --> 00:19:40,316
It's exhausting.

418
00:19:40,318 --> 00:19:42,901
Which is why,
for 20 minutes a day,

419
00:19:42,903 --> 00:19:44,687
I like to go down to that room,

420
00:19:44,689 --> 00:19:45,971
turn my mind off

421
00:19:45,973 --> 00:19:48,390
and do what I need to do
to recharge.

422
00:19:48,392 --> 00:19:51,476
But what are you doing in there?

423
00:19:51,478 --> 00:19:53,145
And what does 43 mean?

424
00:19:53,147 --> 00:19:54,546
You don't need to know,

425
00:19:54,548 --> 00:19:56,081
you don't deserve to know,

426
00:19:56,083 --> 00:19:58,250
and you will never know.

427
00:20:49,032 --> 00:20:52,334
One, two, three, four,

428
00:20:52,336 --> 00:20:56,222
five, six, seven, eight...

429
00:20:56,251 --> 00:20:59,219
Drat.

430
00:21:00,447 --> 00:21:02,664
I'm never going to get
to 43 again.

431
00:21:04,661 --> 00:21:06,969
One, two, three, four...

432
00:21:07,605 --> 00:21:08,897
Rats.
