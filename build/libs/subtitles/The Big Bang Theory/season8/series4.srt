1
00:00:02,528 --> 00:00:04,494
Have you guys heard
about this research team

2
00:00:04,496 --> 00:00:07,697
that's trying to transgenically
manipulate chicken DNA

3
00:00:07,699 --> 00:00:10,033
to create some sort
of chicken dinosaur?

4
00:00:10,035 --> 00:00:13,036
Oh, I think that
sounds wonderful.

5
00:00:14,373 --> 00:00:18,041
What? You're afraid
of both dinosaurs and chickens.

6
00:00:18,043 --> 00:00:19,043
Yes, but tell me

7
00:00:19,044 --> 00:00:21,244
a dinosaur
chicken salad sandwich

8
00:00:21,246 --> 00:00:22,946
wouldn't hit the Mesozoic spot.

9
00:00:26,385 --> 00:00:27,651
Hey, guys.
Hey. Hello.

10
00:00:27,653 --> 00:00:29,186
We still on for
tomorrow night?

11
00:00:29,188 --> 00:00:31,254
Yeah. I'm excited
to finally meet your girlfriend.

12
00:00:31,256 --> 00:00:33,390
Yeah, oh, and
speaking of which.

13
00:00:33,392 --> 00:00:36,159
According to a recent study
out of Oxford University,

14
00:00:36,161 --> 00:00:37,427
when someone takes on

15
00:00:37,429 --> 00:00:39,262
a new romantic
partner,

16
00:00:39,264 --> 00:00:42,132
that person loses one
or two close friends.

17
00:00:42,134 --> 00:00:44,901
Since when do you read
social science?

18
00:00:44,903 --> 00:00:47,871
I go to the bathroom
like everybody else.

19
00:00:47,873 --> 00:00:49,239
Why would I lose friends

20
00:00:49,241 --> 00:00:51,141
just because I
started dating someone?

21
00:00:51,143 --> 00:00:53,176
Yeah, you didn't lose anyone
when you met Amy.

22
00:00:53,178 --> 00:00:56,379
Yeah, well, no, the study
refers to<i> romantic</i> partners.

23
00:00:56,381 --> 00:00:59,616
Not the way I would
categorize the two of us.

24
00:00:59,618 --> 00:01:01,218
You guys kiss and hold hands.

25
00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:03,653
I've seen him do it.
It's not romantic.

26
00:01:03,655 --> 00:01:05,855
Look, I'm not the kind of guy

27
00:01:05,857 --> 00:01:08,658
who drops his friends just
because he's in a relationship.

28
00:01:08,660 --> 00:01:10,327
What happens
if she doesn't like us?

29
00:01:10,329 --> 00:01:11,695
Well, hey,
you're my dear friends.

30
00:01:11,697 --> 00:01:14,064
You'll get a Christmas card
for a couple of years,

31
00:01:14,066 --> 00:01:15,632
and then you're dead to me.

32
00:01:18,070 --> 00:01:21,705
? Our whole universe
was in a hot, dense state ?

33
00:01:21,707 --> 00:01:25,041
? Then nearly 14 billion years
ago expansion started... Wait! ?

34
00:01:25,043 --> 00:01:26,643
? The Earth began to cool ?

35
00:01:26,645 --> 00:01:29,212
? The autotrophs began to drool,
Neanderthals developed tools ?

36
00:01:29,214 --> 00:01:31,881
? We built the Wall ?
?<i> We built the pyramids</i> ?

37
00:01:31,883 --> 00:01:34,551
? Math, Science, History,
unraveling the mystery ?

38
00:01:34,553 --> 00:01:36,453
? That all started
with a big bang ?

39
00:01:36,455 --> 00:01:36,765
?<i> Bang!</i> ?

42
00:01:46,768 --> 00:01:50,036
So, Howard, is Stuart still
living with your mom?

43
00:01:50,038 --> 00:01:51,837
I don't want
to talk about it.

44
00:01:51,839 --> 00:01:54,240
But he's going to.
My mom got him cable!

45
00:01:54,242 --> 00:01:56,375
In my whole life,

46
00:01:56,377 --> 00:01:58,144
growing up
in that house-- no cable.

47
00:01:58,146 --> 00:01:59,579
Do you know how many HBOs

48
00:01:59,581 --> 00:02:01,581
that leech had my mother
get him? Seven.

49
00:02:01,583 --> 00:02:03,916
Seven HBOs. Seven!

50
00:02:03,918 --> 00:02:07,663
Long story short,
they have seven HBOs.

51
00:02:07,665 --> 00:02:08,964
Hey, guys.

52
00:02:08,966 --> 00:02:10,866
Hey.
Hello. Hey.

53
00:02:10,868 --> 00:02:12,901
Emily, you know almost everybody here.
Hi.

54
00:02:12,903 --> 00:02:14,703
This is Leonard,
this is Penny.

55
00:02:14,705 --> 00:02:16,038
Oh, it's so nice
to meet you.

56
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:17,773
Nice to finally meet you, too.
Hi.

57
00:02:17,775 --> 00:02:18,907
Hello.

58
00:02:18,909 --> 00:02:21,376
Well, Raj,
you were not lying about her.

59
00:02:21,378 --> 00:02:24,179
I told you
she exists.

60
00:02:24,181 --> 00:02:26,214
Hey, I hear you're
a dermatologist.

61
00:02:26,216 --> 00:02:29,217
Uh, yeah, I'm a resident
at Huntington Hospital.

62
00:02:29,219 --> 00:02:31,753
Oh, I like their
emergency room.

63
00:02:31,755 --> 00:02:34,623
Yeah, even if it turns out
you don't have Dengue fever,

64
00:02:34,625 --> 00:02:37,025
they still let you
take a lollipop.

65
00:02:38,095 --> 00:02:39,761
You know, Penny
just started training

66
00:02:39,763 --> 00:02:41,496
to be a pharmaceutical
sales rep.

67
00:02:41,498 --> 00:02:43,665
Maybe she can practice
on you some time.

68
00:02:43,667 --> 00:02:46,368
Oh, it would be great
to practice on a real doctor.

69
00:02:46,370 --> 00:02:48,537
Yeah. I'm sure that'd be fine.

70
00:02:48,539 --> 00:02:52,240
I have some odd
freckles on my buttocks.

71
00:02:54,044 --> 00:02:57,713
Can I make an appointment
for you to look at them?

72
00:02:57,715 --> 00:03:00,182
Um... okay, I guess.

73
00:03:00,184 --> 00:03:03,018
I'm with him three
years, nothing.

74
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:06,421
She's with two minutes, and
he's taking his pants off.

75
00:03:10,894 --> 00:03:13,495
Last night was fun.
What did you think of Emily?

76
00:03:13,497 --> 00:03:14,830
I don't know.

77
00:03:14,832 --> 00:03:16,999
I kind of got the sense
she didn't like me.

78
00:03:17,001 --> 00:03:18,767
Did she<i> say</i> she didn't like you?

79
00:03:18,769 --> 00:03:19,901
Of course not. No one ever says

80
00:03:19,903 --> 00:03:21,436
they don't like you
straight to your face.

81
00:03:21,438 --> 00:03:25,307
We have led different lives.

82
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:29,544
You guys just met.
Why would she feel that way?

83
00:03:29,546 --> 00:03:31,013
It's just this
vibe I got.

84
00:03:31,015 --> 00:03:32,995
I'm sure you're worried
about nothing.

85
00:03:32,996 --> 00:03:34,416
Yeah.
You're probably right.

86
00:03:34,418 --> 00:03:35,784
I used to think
my high school P.E. teacher

87
00:03:35,786 --> 00:03:37,019
didn't like me,
but it turned out,

88
00:03:37,021 --> 00:03:39,187
she liked me a little too much.

89
00:03:39,189 --> 00:03:40,455
Really?
Yeah.

90
00:03:40,457 --> 00:03:41,690
It was fine.

91
00:03:41,692 --> 00:03:43,558
We went to a Melissa Etheridge
concert, I got an A,

92
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:45,227
it all worked out.

93
00:03:45,229 --> 00:03:48,563
When you go to Emily's office to
practice, you'll see. It's fine.

94
00:03:48,565 --> 00:03:50,265
Yeah, I hope you're right.

95
00:03:50,267 --> 00:03:52,234
You really went your entire life

96
00:03:52,236 --> 00:03:55,871
without anyone saying
“I hate you” to your face?

97
00:03:55,873 --> 00:03:57,439
Yeah.

98
00:03:57,441 --> 00:04:01,443
I'd say it now,
but look at those cheekbones.

99
00:04:08,185 --> 00:04:10,185
I miss
Stuart's place.

100
00:04:10,187 --> 00:04:13,855
All this loud music
and exposed brick.

101
00:04:13,857 --> 00:04:16,124
What, is this
a comic book store,

102
00:04:16,126 --> 00:04:19,628
or a rave at the third
little pig's house?

103
00:04:20,698 --> 00:04:22,898
Yup, I wish
Stuart would reopen.

104
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:24,900
I hate this place, too.

105
00:04:24,902 --> 00:04:26,702
Okay, him I believe

106
00:04:26,704 --> 00:04:29,871
because he's an 80-year-old man
in a 15-year-old's T-shirt.

107
00:04:29,873 --> 00:04:31,640
But you're just upset

108
00:04:31,642 --> 00:04:35,043
about Stuart and your mom
and all their HBOs.

109
00:04:35,045 --> 00:04:38,547
Yes, I am. You know, I can't
even watch<i> Game of Thrones</i> now

110
00:04:38,549 --> 00:04:40,215
without thinking
of mother saying,

111
00:04:40,217 --> 00:04:43,385
“Stuart, which one is Thrones?”

112
00:04:44,221 --> 00:04:46,221
You know, he might not reopen.

113
00:04:46,223 --> 00:04:49,057
He didn't get a lot of money
from the insurance company.

114
00:04:49,059 --> 00:04:51,717
Oh, boy, if there is one thing
that gets my goat,

115
00:04:51,719 --> 00:04:55,020
those dad-gum
insurance companies.

116
00:04:55,022 --> 00:04:57,623
Why? Because they won't
get off your lawn?

117
00:05:00,828 --> 00:05:05,564
Oh, is Stuart trying to get a
loan, or-or find investors?

118
00:05:05,566 --> 00:05:07,599
All I know is,
he's got my mother

119
00:05:07,601 --> 00:05:10,669
buying four-ply toilet paper.
I mean, four-ply.

120
00:05:11,705 --> 00:05:13,105
If his butt is so delicate,

121
00:05:13,107 --> 00:05:15,474
why doesn't he just use
an angora rabbit?

122
00:05:16,477 --> 00:05:19,544
For starters,
they shed and bite.

123
00:05:20,347 --> 00:05:22,180
Hey,

124
00:05:22,182 --> 00:05:23,649
here's a thought.

125
00:05:23,651 --> 00:05:26,151
Why don't we put up the rest
of the money that Stuart needs?

126
00:05:27,221 --> 00:05:30,789
So, we'd be, like, owners
of a comic book store?

127
00:05:32,359 --> 00:05:34,192
It's kind of a
dream come true.

128
00:05:34,194 --> 00:05:35,694
That does sound fun.

129
00:05:35,696 --> 00:05:37,229
Ooh, maybe we could come up

130
00:05:37,231 --> 00:05:39,731
with a business plan
to compete with this place.

131
00:05:39,733 --> 00:05:41,600
I'll give you a plan right now.

132
00:05:41,602 --> 00:05:44,102
Step one:
open comic book store.

133
00:05:44,104 --> 00:05:45,570
Step two: start rumor

134
00:05:45,572 --> 00:05:48,874
this comic book store
gives you genital warts.

135
00:05:50,511 --> 00:05:54,680
Step three: buy a big bag
to put the money in.

136
00:05:56,850 --> 00:05:59,051
It's not that bad.

137
00:06:03,123 --> 00:06:06,425
Hey.
Hi.

138
00:06:06,427 --> 00:06:09,299
Thank you so much for letting me
practice my sales pitch on you.

139
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:10,300
I really appreciate it.

140
00:06:10,308 --> 00:06:11,121
Sure.

141
00:06:11,145 --> 00:06:12,273
Um, I brought coffee.

142
00:06:12,274 --> 00:06:13,807
I wasn't sure what you like,
so I got

143
00:06:13,809 --> 00:06:16,043
a regular, a cappuccino
and a Chai tea.

144
00:06:16,045 --> 00:06:19,179
Since you like Raj, I thought
you might be into that.

145
00:06:19,181 --> 00:06:22,482
Thanks. If we could get started.
I'm a little busy.

146
00:06:22,484 --> 00:06:25,252
Oh, yeah, sure. Let me
just get out my materials.

147
00:06:25,254 --> 00:06:26,753
Leonard gave me this briefcase.

148
00:06:26,755 --> 00:06:28,422
He used to carry it
around in high school.

149
00:06:28,424 --> 00:06:31,758
You can still see the dent
where they whacked him with it.

150
00:06:33,929 --> 00:06:36,029
Okay, I would like
to talk to you

151
00:06:36,031 --> 00:06:38,298
about our new
birth control pill, Femevra.

152
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:39,633
Great.

153
00:06:39,635 --> 00:06:41,668
So, Femevra's
triphasic design

154
00:06:41,670 --> 00:06:43,804
provides balanced
hormonal exposure.

155
00:06:43,806 --> 00:06:45,639
All right.

156
00:06:45,641 --> 00:06:48,408
It has also been shown to cause

157
00:06:48,410 --> 00:06:51,445
significantly fewer side effects
than other oral contraceptives.

158
00:06:51,447 --> 00:06:54,314
Although it can cause acne,
which, if you ask me, kind of

159
00:06:54,316 --> 00:06:57,084
increases its effectiveness
as a contraceptive.

160
00:07:00,990 --> 00:07:02,656
Funny.

161
00:07:04,159 --> 00:07:06,960
Okay, I'm sorry. Did we get off
on the wrong foot?

162
00:07:06,962 --> 00:07:08,829
Because since the other
night, I kind of feel like

163
00:07:08,831 --> 00:07:10,364
you might have a problem
with me.

164
00:07:10,366 --> 00:07:11,732
No, it's fine.

165
00:07:11,734 --> 00:07:14,301
Are you sure,
because it doesn't seem fine?

166
00:07:14,303 --> 00:07:16,536
Okay.

167
00:07:16,538 --> 00:07:18,338
If you really want
to talk about this,

168
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:19,640
I do have a problem.

169
00:07:19,642 --> 00:07:21,908
Oh, my God.
Tell me-- what did I do?

170
00:07:21,910 --> 00:07:23,276
Look, it's nothing. It's just...

171
00:07:23,278 --> 00:07:25,912
Raj told me that a while ago,
you two hooked up.

172
00:07:25,914 --> 00:07:30,183
What?! Oh, why
would he say that?

173
00:07:30,185 --> 00:07:31,685
Did it not happen?

174
00:07:31,687 --> 00:07:34,454
Well, I wouldn't exactly
call it a hook-up.

175
00:07:34,456 --> 00:07:35,555
Did you kiss?

176
00:07:35,557 --> 00:07:37,524
Yeah.

177
00:07:37,526 --> 00:07:38,526
Were you naked?

178
00:07:38,527 --> 00:07:40,927
Yeah.

179
00:07:40,929 --> 00:07:42,729
So, it<i> was</i> a hook-up.

180
00:07:42,731 --> 00:07:44,698
No.

181
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:46,900
Yeah.

182
00:07:49,004 --> 00:07:52,673
So, what are some ways we
could set our comic book store

183
00:07:52,675 --> 00:07:54,341
apart from the
competition?

184
00:07:54,343 --> 00:07:56,076
Oh, kids buy comic books.
It would be great

185
00:07:56,078 --> 00:07:58,178
to figure out a way
to get more kids in the store.

186
00:07:58,180 --> 00:08:00,180
You know, when I was a
kid, I loved going there,

187
00:08:00,182 --> 00:08:02,182
but I could
never get a ride.

188
00:08:02,184 --> 00:08:06,186
Ooh, what if we got a van and
drove around and picked kids up?

189
00:08:10,359 --> 00:08:12,392
Nice.

190
00:08:13,595 --> 00:08:16,830
You mean,
like at parks and schools?

191
00:08:17,499 --> 00:08:20,367
Toy stores,
puppet shows.

192
00:08:20,369 --> 00:08:24,504
Hold on. So, your idea is
to get a van

193
00:08:24,506 --> 00:08:27,941
and cruise the streets looking
for kids to pick up?

194
00:08:29,478 --> 00:08:31,845
Yes.

195
00:08:32,981 --> 00:08:36,717
And are you gonna use candy
to lure them in?

196
00:08:37,586 --> 00:08:40,120
We are now!

197
00:08:42,124 --> 00:08:44,391
You told Emily
we hooked up?!

198
00:08:44,393 --> 00:08:47,761
Um, well, in my defense,
I tell everybody.

199
00:08:47,763 --> 00:08:49,162
Why would you say that?!

200
00:08:49,164 --> 00:08:51,465
We were having a conversation
about past lovers.

201
00:08:51,467 --> 00:08:52,599
We weren't lovers! Come on.

202
00:08:52,601 --> 00:08:53,867
Everyone knows
we didn't sleep together.

203
00:08:53,869 --> 00:08:55,168
We got drunk
and fooled around.

204
00:08:55,170 --> 00:08:56,937
Why couldn't you just
leave me out of it?

205
00:08:56,939 --> 00:08:58,071
Well, we were being honest.

206
00:08:58,073 --> 00:08:59,840
You would leave me
out of the conversation

207
00:08:59,842 --> 00:09:01,708
with the next guy
if you dump Leonard?

208
00:09:01,710 --> 00:09:04,878
Why say it?
Yes!

209
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:07,247
Well, I would never
leave you off my list,

210
00:09:07,249 --> 00:09:08,882
and not just

211
00:09:08,884 --> 00:09:10,183
because, without you,

212
00:09:10,185 --> 00:09:12,619
we're playing fast and loose
with the word “list.”

213
00:09:12,621 --> 00:09:14,654
Well, good job.
Now she hates me.

214
00:09:14,656 --> 00:09:16,823
Oh.

215
00:09:16,825 --> 00:09:19,092
Great.

216
00:09:19,094 --> 00:09:21,595
On the bright side,
that Oxford study was right.

217
00:09:21,597 --> 00:09:23,663
One friend down.

218
00:09:24,867 --> 00:09:28,935
I wonder who you're going
to lose next.

219
00:09:28,937 --> 00:09:31,338
You, okay? It's you.
You're-you're next!

220
00:09:33,208 --> 00:09:36,109
No. You're crazy about me.

221
00:09:40,581 --> 00:09:42,682
I feel pretty....oh so pretty.

222
00:09:44,810 --> 00:09:47,044
I don't know what Emily's
so upset about anyway.

223
00:09:47,046 --> 00:09:49,980
Even if I had slept with him,
so what? Everyone has a past.

224
00:09:50,783 --> 00:09:53,450
Almost everyone has a past.

225
00:09:53,452 --> 00:09:54,885
Come on, look
how pretty you are.

226
00:09:54,887 --> 00:09:56,987
I'm sure this isn't
the first girl to hate you.

227
00:09:56,989 --> 00:09:59,590
It's not.

228
00:09:59,592 --> 00:10:02,226
And I'm sure
you can turn it around.

229
00:10:02,228 --> 00:10:04,528
How? You can't force someone
to like you.

230
00:10:04,530 --> 00:10:05,596
What if you just

231
00:10:05,598 --> 00:10:07,264
hang around and act
like her friend

232
00:10:07,266 --> 00:10:09,833
until you wear her down?
I mean, next thing you know,

233
00:10:09,835 --> 00:10:11,190
you're in her home,
you're eating her food,

234
00:10:11,214 --> 00:10:12,285
drinking her wine.

235
00:10:15,208 --> 00:10:16,807
No, that won't work.

236
00:10:16,809 --> 00:10:19,143
You're right. Cheers.

237
00:10:19,145 --> 00:10:20,411
Oh, I know.

238
00:10:20,413 --> 00:10:22,379
Why don't you use
your sales training

239
00:10:22,381 --> 00:10:24,615
to go back down there
and sell<i> yourself?</i>

240
00:10:24,617 --> 00:10:26,016
What?
Yeah.

241
00:10:26,018 --> 00:10:27,585
But instead of selling a drug,

242
00:10:27,587 --> 00:10:29,386
you'd be selling Penny--
it's cute.

243
00:10:29,388 --> 00:10:30,421
It's stupid.

244
00:10:30,423 --> 00:10:32,623
Well, maybe people
would like you more

245
00:10:32,625 --> 00:10:35,392
if you didn't crap
all over their ideas.

246
00:10:35,394 --> 00:10:37,995
I'm gonna go with
Penny on this one.

247
00:10:37,997 --> 00:10:41,632
Then again, why wouldn't I?
I mean, we go way back.

248
00:10:41,634 --> 00:10:44,668
Oh, my God.
I didn't used to like you.

249
00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:47,871
Shh. Amy's here now.

250
00:10:50,710 --> 00:10:53,210
You know, the more
I think about it,

251
00:10:53,212 --> 00:10:56,847
the more intrigued I am
about having our own store.

252
00:10:56,849 --> 00:10:58,849
We'll get to see
all the new stuff

253
00:10:58,851 --> 00:11:00,484
before it hits the shelves.

254
00:11:00,486 --> 00:11:02,386
And we'll get to have
fun interactions

255
00:11:02,388 --> 00:11:03,554
with our customers.

256
00:11:03,556 --> 00:11:07,191
“This isn't a library--
buy it or get out.”

257
00:11:07,193 --> 00:11:10,160
You say things like that
all the time.

258
00:11:10,162 --> 00:11:12,429
Yes, but as a store owner,
I'll finally have a good comeback

259
00:11:12,431 --> 00:11:14,898
to, “You don't work here--
shut up.”

260
00:11:16,235 --> 00:11:18,569
Uh, do you know how Penny
told Raj he should have

261
00:11:18,571 --> 00:11:20,404
left her off his list?
Yeah.

262
00:11:20,406 --> 00:11:22,906
Well, do you think when she
and I had that conversation,

263
00:11:22,908 --> 00:11:24,408
she left people off<i> her</i> list?

264
00:11:24,410 --> 00:11:25,743
I'm sure she did.

265
00:11:25,745 --> 00:11:27,778
Why?

266
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:29,513
Because if she hadn't,

267
00:11:29,515 --> 00:11:33,217
she'd still be wading
through the list.

268
00:11:33,219 --> 00:11:34,918
Will you stay out of this?

269
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:37,588
If only Penny
had said that once in a while.

270
00:11:39,692 --> 00:11:41,191
Hey, what difference
does it make?

271
00:11:41,193 --> 00:11:43,027
You're the one
she wants to marry.

272
00:11:43,029 --> 00:11:44,762
That's true.
Yeah, and I'm not sure

273
00:11:44,764 --> 00:11:47,731
that complete honesty
is always the best thing

274
00:11:47,733 --> 00:11:49,566
for a relationship.

275
00:11:49,568 --> 00:11:52,603
Yeah, he's right.
Once, in a moment of candor,

276
00:11:52,605 --> 00:11:55,439
I told Amy
that her hair reminded me

277
00:11:55,441 --> 00:11:58,609
of a duck caught
in an oil spill. Well...

278
00:11:58,611 --> 00:12:00,477
she stormed out.

279
00:12:00,479 --> 00:12:03,147
Which was sad, because
we were playing Scrabble,

280
00:12:03,149 --> 00:12:07,551
and I had all the letters
to spell “persimmon.”

281
00:12:10,690 --> 00:12:13,057
Why are you even part
of this conversation?

282
00:12:13,059 --> 00:12:14,925
You don't know
anything about women.

283
00:12:14,927 --> 00:12:17,628
I know that if I had
a wife or a fianc?e,

284
00:12:17,630 --> 00:12:19,697
I'd ask her first
before I invested money

285
00:12:19,699 --> 00:12:21,532
in a comic book store.

286
00:12:21,534 --> 00:12:23,267
He's right.

287
00:12:23,269 --> 00:12:24,335
Yeah, well,

288
00:12:24,337 --> 00:12:25,602
of course I am.

289
00:12:25,604 --> 00:12:27,037
I was also right about her hair.

290
00:12:27,039 --> 00:12:29,106
It did everything but quack.

291
00:12:32,278 --> 00:12:34,511
There's something
I wanted to run past you.

292
00:12:34,513 --> 00:12:36,680
What's up?
Mm, the guys and I

293
00:12:36,682 --> 00:12:39,450
were thinking about investing
in Stuart's comic book store.

294
00:12:39,452 --> 00:12:41,985
Is that okay?
Why are you asking me?

295
00:12:41,987 --> 00:12:43,821
Well, you know,
we're engaged,

296
00:12:43,823 --> 00:12:46,323
and it's kind of
a big deal financially.

297
00:12:46,325 --> 00:12:48,625
It seems like something
we should talk about.

298
00:12:48,627 --> 00:12:49,893
Oh.

299
00:12:49,895 --> 00:12:52,329
Well, would you consider
mounds of credit card debt

300
00:12:52,331 --> 00:12:54,865
kind of a big deal
financially?

301
00:12:56,836 --> 00:12:58,869
Yeah.

302
00:12:58,871 --> 00:13:00,471
Huh.

303
00:13:02,641 --> 00:13:05,743
Mm. So, me and the guys
were talking about

304
00:13:05,745 --> 00:13:07,711
this great
investment opportunity...

305
00:13:07,713 --> 00:13:09,713
Nope.

306
00:13:09,715 --> 00:13:12,449
But you didn't hear what it was.

307
00:13:12,451 --> 00:13:15,219
I know.

308
00:13:16,088 --> 00:13:17,988
Oh, come on.

309
00:13:17,990 --> 00:13:19,456
Fine. What is it?

310
00:13:19,458 --> 00:13:21,558
It's to help reopen
the comic book store.

311
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:23,327
Nope.

312
00:13:23,329 --> 00:13:25,429
Well, hear me out.

313
00:13:25,431 --> 00:13:27,631
Howard, you know
we're saving up for a house.

314
00:13:27,633 --> 00:13:29,967
I know, but all the guys
are doing it.

315
00:13:29,969 --> 00:13:32,870
We're splitting it four ways, so
it's really not that much money.

316
00:13:32,872 --> 00:13:35,639
It just seems
like a risky investment.

317
00:13:35,641 --> 00:13:38,342
I get that. I...

318
00:13:39,245 --> 00:13:41,845
Okay, look...

319
00:13:43,382 --> 00:13:48,218
The reason this is important
is...

320
00:13:49,321 --> 00:13:52,956
...before my dad left
me and my mom...

321
00:13:52,958 --> 00:13:56,660
he used to... take me
to the comic book store.

322
00:13:57,596 --> 00:14:01,098
It was one of the few things
we did together.

323
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:03,867
Oh. Howie, I had no idea.

324
00:14:03,869 --> 00:14:07,271
Well, I don't...
like to talk about it.

325
00:14:07,273 --> 00:14:09,973
Oh, baby.

326
00:14:09,975 --> 00:14:13,444
That story's made
up, isn't it?

327
00:14:14,647 --> 00:14:18,215
That's how much buying
a comic book store means to me.

328
00:14:21,187 --> 00:14:23,887
I'd like your honest
opinion on something.

329
00:14:23,889 --> 00:14:25,122
Of course.

330
00:14:25,124 --> 00:14:26,590
Now, before I start,

331
00:14:26,592 --> 00:14:30,594
I need you to know that
I'm very excited about this,

332
00:14:30,596 --> 00:14:32,696
and anything you say

333
00:14:32,698 --> 00:14:34,765
that isn't
enthusiastically supportive

334
00:14:34,767 --> 00:14:38,469
will throw our entire
relationship into question.

335
00:14:40,606 --> 00:14:42,306
So...

336
00:14:42,308 --> 00:14:45,075
keep an open mind.

337
00:14:45,077 --> 00:14:48,178
I'm feeling a little backed
into a corner, Sheldon.

338
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:50,214
Perfect. Now...

339
00:14:51,484 --> 00:14:53,951
...I'm considering investing

340
00:14:53,953 --> 00:14:56,653
in Stuart's comic book store.

341
00:14:57,523 --> 00:14:58,989
Interesting.

342
00:15:01,093 --> 00:15:03,827
Can you see how
a grown man,

343
00:15:03,829 --> 00:15:05,429
an accomplished scientist,

344
00:15:05,431 --> 00:15:07,965
who invests in a store

345
00:15:07,967 --> 00:15:09,833
that sells picture books

346
00:15:09,835 --> 00:15:13,237
about flying men in
colorful underwear...

347
00:15:14,507 --> 00:15:16,673
...might be wasting
both his financial

348
00:15:16,675 --> 00:15:18,742
and intellectual
resources?

349
00:15:25,384 --> 00:15:27,584
No.

350
00:15:29,121 --> 00:15:31,755
Then I think it's
a terrific idea.

351
00:15:31,757 --> 00:15:33,624
Great.

352
00:15:33,626 --> 00:15:37,761
Wait till you hear
about our van.

353
00:15:42,067 --> 00:15:44,001
Hey. Thanks for inviting us over.
Hey.

354
00:15:44,003 --> 00:15:45,435
Oh, thank you
for coming.

355
00:15:45,437 --> 00:15:47,971
Uh, listen, Penny,
before you start,

356
00:15:47,973 --> 00:15:49,940
I just want to apologize
for being so rude

357
00:15:49,942 --> 00:15:51,275
the other day
in my office.

358
00:15:51,277 --> 00:15:52,743
No, no. No need to apologize.

359
00:15:52,745 --> 00:15:54,444
Excuse me,
can I say something?

360
00:15:54,446 --> 00:15:56,580
I just love both you guys,

361
00:15:56,582 --> 00:15:58,549
and I want you
to get along.

362
00:15:58,551 --> 00:16:01,151
And when I say “love”"
I meant as a friend.

363
00:16:02,121 --> 00:16:04,888
And, uh, way
too soon, right?

364
00:16:06,225 --> 00:16:07,891
Okay, sit down.
Listen, Emily,

365
00:16:07,893 --> 00:16:09,459
what happened
between me and Raj

366
00:16:09,461 --> 00:16:10,961
was a long time ago.
It was,

367
00:16:10,963 --> 00:16:12,329
and I may have
made it seem

368
00:16:12,331 --> 00:16:14,031
like a bigger deal
than I should have.

369
00:16:14,033 --> 00:16:15,499
Yeah, and Leonard and I
are engaged now,

370
00:16:15,501 --> 00:16:17,901
and I'm just hoping we can put
this whole thing behind us.

371
00:16:17,903 --> 00:16:19,369
Mm. I'd like that, too.

372
00:16:19,371 --> 00:16:21,538
Yeah, I thought
I'd be okay with it,

373
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:23,774
but then I saw
how pretty you are.

374
00:16:23,776 --> 00:16:25,309
Oh, that's so sweet.

375
00:16:25,311 --> 00:16:27,444
I mean, look at you--
you are gorgeous.

376
00:16:27,446 --> 00:16:31,181
It's true--
you're both gorgeous.

377
00:16:31,183 --> 00:16:33,884
Kind of says something about
the man who could bed you both.

378
00:16:40,326 --> 00:16:44,661
You get why I've been alone
most of my adult life.

379
00:16:47,333 --> 00:16:50,067
So, what brings you by?
Well,

380
00:16:50,069 --> 00:16:52,836
I don't need a reason--
it's my house.

381
00:16:52,838 --> 00:16:55,172
Technically,
it's your mom's house, but...

382
00:16:55,174 --> 00:16:58,175
we certainly want you
to feel welcome.

383
00:16:58,177 --> 00:17:00,944
I'm always welcome.

384
00:17:00,946 --> 00:17:03,714
Mm, just... try and call first.

385
00:17:03,716 --> 00:17:06,984
Okay, let's get
down to business.

386
00:17:06,986 --> 00:17:09,353
Howie was thinking about
putting up some money

387
00:17:09,355 --> 00:17:12,322
to help you reopen the store,
but before that happens,

388
00:17:12,324 --> 00:17:14,391
I have a few questions.
Oh.

389
00:17:14,393 --> 00:17:15,759
I appreciate the offer,

390
00:17:15,761 --> 00:17:18,895
but actually your mother
already gave me the money.

391
00:17:20,566 --> 00:17:22,866
What?

392
00:17:22,868 --> 00:17:25,002
Yeah. I told her
it was too much,

393
00:17:25,004 --> 00:17:28,171
but she said she was happy
to help out her<i> bubala.</i>

394
00:17:29,441 --> 00:17:31,708
Excuse me.

395
00:17:32,678 --> 00:17:35,012
Ma, you are canceling
that check,

396
00:17:35,014 --> 00:17:37,781
and Stuart is not your<i> bubala;</i>
I'm your<i> bubala.</i>

397
00:17:37,783 --> 00:17:41,051
You can't have more
than one<i> bubala!</i>

398
00:17:41,053 --> 00:17:42,786
I don't know
who he's talking to.

399
00:17:42,788 --> 00:17:45,255
She's at Target,
buying me shirts.

400
00:17:48,293 --> 00:17:50,794
I'm so glad we
could work this all out.

401
00:17:50,796 --> 00:17:53,430
Yeah, me, too.
You know, we should have dinner

402
00:17:53,432 --> 00:17:54,798
one night with you and Leonard.

403
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:55,999
Oh, we would love that.

404
00:17:56,001 --> 00:17:56,733
Great!

405
00:17:57,970 --> 00:18:00,037
Okay, good night, guys.
All right, night.

406
00:18:00,039 --> 00:18:02,039
Bye.

407
00:18:02,041 --> 00:18:04,608
I hate her.
I hate her.

408

00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:15,106
I'm really disappointed
we're not gonna have

410
00:18:15,108 --> 00:18:16,808
our own comic book store.
I know.

411
00:18:16,810 --> 00:18:18,576
I was looking forward to it.
It would've been

412
00:18:18,578 --> 00:18:20,878
so nice to have a place
that was ours,

413
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:23,848
where we could just sit
and read comics in peace.

414
00:18:23,850 --> 00:18:25,316
With comfy seats.

415
00:18:25,318 --> 00:18:26,684
And snacks.

416
00:18:26,686 --> 00:18:28,786
Well, I guess
it was too good to be true.

417
00:18:28,788 --> 00:18:30,321
Yeah.
