1
00:00:02,107 --> 00:00:05,575
Oh, hey, we ran into your
mom at Benihana last night.

2
00:00:05,577 --> 00:00:07,276
Uh, yeah, she loves that place.

3
00:00:07,278 --> 00:00:09,178
Every time they flip
a shrimp in the air,

4
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:11,814
she practically leaps out
of her seat to catch it.

5
00:00:12,784 --> 00:00:15,084
That's why I don't take her
to SeaWorld.

6
00:00:16,321 --> 00:00:17,620
I know you-you don't
want to hear it,

7
00:00:17,622 --> 00:00:18,921
but she was there with Stuart.

8
00:00:18,923 --> 00:00:20,089
That's fine.

9
00:00:20,091 --> 00:00:21,324
I don't care.

10
00:00:21,326 --> 00:00:23,426
It doesn't bug you when
they go out on dates?

11
00:00:23,428 --> 00:00:24,694
They're not dating.

12
00:00:24,696 --> 00:00:27,530
They're just two friends
who went out to dinner.

13
00:00:27,532 --> 00:00:29,499
And then went back
to the home they share

14
00:00:29,501 --> 00:00:30,566
where they probably fell asleep

15
00:00:30,568 --> 00:00:32,135
in the matching pajamas
she got them

16
00:00:32,137 --> 00:00:35,071
because they both
just love penguins.

17
00:00:36,307 --> 00:00:39,041
Hey, lots of people
wear matching pajamas

18
00:00:39,043 --> 00:00:40,009
who aren't dating.

19
00:00:40,011 --> 00:00:43,079
Like who?
Like you and your dog.

20
00:00:44,649 --> 00:00:47,283
Don't rule out the dating.

21
00:00:47,285 --> 00:00:49,919
Fine, it bothers me.

22
00:00:49,921 --> 00:00:51,788
You happy?

23
00:00:51,790 --> 00:00:53,389
You think you've got problems.

24
00:00:53,391 --> 00:00:57,326
The gibbon is the only member
of the ape family not classified

25
00:00:57,328 --> 00:01:00,129
as a great ape.

26
00:01:00,131 --> 00:01:02,031
How is this helpful?

27
00:01:02,033 --> 00:01:04,567
All the non-human apes
are classified

28
00:01:04,569 --> 00:01:06,202
as great apes except one.

29
00:01:06,204 --> 00:01:09,438
That means taxonomists created
the entire category

30
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:12,441
of lesser ape just
to single out the poor gibbon

31
00:01:12,443 --> 00:01:15,144
as the weird kid
on the playground.

32
00:01:15,146 --> 00:01:19,315
Now there's a hairy little
fellow with a genuine beef.

33
00:01:19,317 --> 00:01:22,285
But the gibbon doesn't know
what it's categorized as.

34
00:01:22,287 --> 00:01:23,920
It doesn't even know
it's called a gibbon.

35
00:01:23,922 --> 00:01:25,888
True.

36
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:28,491
Sorry, kid, you've got it
worse than a gibbon.

37
00:01:30,228 --> 00:01:33,863
? Our whole universe
was in a hot, dense state ?

38
00:01:33,865 --> 00:01:37,200
? Then nearly 14 billion years
ago expansion started... Wait! ?

39
00:01:37,202 --> 00:01:38,835
? The Earth began to cool ?

40
00:01:38,837 --> 00:01:41,370
? The autotrophs began to drool,
Neanderthals developed tools ?

41
00:01:41,372 --> 00:01:44,040
? We built the Wall ?
?<i> We built the pyramids</i> ?

42
00:01:44,042 --> 00:01:46,709
? Math, Science, History,
unraveling the mystery ?

43
00:01:46,711 --> 00:01:48,611
? That all started
with a big bang ?

44
00:01:48,613 --> 00:01:49,684
?<i> Bang!</i> ?

45

47
00:01:59,187 --> 00:02:00,920
(knocking on door)
Hi.

48
00:02:00,922 --> 00:02:01,854
Hey.

49
00:02:01,856 --> 00:02:03,122
We brought snacks
for movie night.

50
00:02:03,124 --> 00:02:04,423
Oh, great.

51
00:02:04,425 --> 00:02:06,359
I don't suppose you also brought
napkins, clean bowls,

52
00:02:06,361 --> 00:02:08,227
utensils and a roll
of toilet paper.

53
00:02:08,229 --> 00:02:09,229
Right here.

54
00:02:09,230 --> 00:02:11,263
Ah!

55
00:02:11,265 --> 00:02:12,665
You guys are the best.

56
00:02:12,667 --> 00:02:13,733
What's with the clothes?

57
00:02:13,735 --> 00:02:15,701
Well, with all the new stuff
I bought for work,

58
00:02:15,703 --> 00:02:17,370
I needed to make room
in my closet.

59
00:02:17,372 --> 00:02:18,971
I meant why are they folded?

60
00:02:18,973 --> 00:02:21,240
But whatever.

61
00:02:21,242 --> 00:02:23,776
Ooh, what's this?

62
00:02:23,778 --> 00:02:26,679
That, believe it or not,
is my prom dress.

63
00:02:26,681 --> 00:02:28,981
Wow, you still have it?

64
00:02:28,983 --> 00:02:30,483
I just assumed
it was balled up

65
00:02:30,485 --> 00:02:34,086
in the corner
of a barn somewhere.

66
00:02:36,324 --> 00:02:38,657
What kind of teenager
did you think I was?

67
00:02:38,659 --> 00:02:40,760
Slutty.
Easy.

68
00:02:42,230 --> 00:02:44,964
The word is "popular."

69
00:02:45,967 --> 00:02:47,967
How was your prom?
Did you go?

70
00:02:47,969 --> 00:02:49,502
No, but I was
on clean-up crew.

71
00:02:49,504 --> 00:02:51,170
Aw, that's sad.

72
00:02:51,172 --> 00:02:52,805
No, it was okay.

73
00:02:52,807 --> 00:02:55,341
The DJ let me dance
one slow song with my mop

74
00:02:55,343 --> 00:02:57,743
before he shut down.

75
00:02:57,745 --> 00:03:00,046
Whenever I see
a bucket of dirty water,

76
00:03:00,048 --> 00:03:03,749
I still hear "Lady in Red."

77
00:03:05,386 --> 00:03:07,653
My prom was pretty
terrible, too.

78
00:03:07,655 --> 00:03:08,954
I was so excited
about my date,

79
00:03:08,956 --> 00:03:10,723
but it turned out
he only asked me

80
00:03:10,725 --> 00:03:11,791
'cause he liked my friend.

81
00:03:11,793 --> 00:03:13,859
He spent the whole night
talking about her.

82
00:03:13,861 --> 00:03:16,262
Okay, we get it, you had
a friend<i> and</i> a date.

83
00:03:16,264 --> 00:03:18,064
Stop bragging.

84
00:03:18,066 --> 00:03:19,632
Doesn't matter.

85
00:03:19,634 --> 00:03:20,699
Prom is silly anyways.

86
00:03:20,701 --> 00:03:22,368
Easy for you to say;
you probably went

87
00:03:22,370 --> 00:03:23,803
with the captain
of the football team.

88
00:03:23,805 --> 00:03:25,938
(scoffs)
No.

89
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:27,606
I just made out
with him a little

90
00:03:27,608 --> 00:03:29,475
while his date was puking.

91
00:03:29,477 --> 00:03:32,812
My date would've had
to clean that up.

92
00:03:34,182 --> 00:03:35,614
Ooh, I have an idea.

93
00:03:35,616 --> 00:03:38,651
Maybe we can have,
like, a prom do-over.

94
00:03:38,653 --> 00:03:40,586
Oh, that would be so much fun.

95
00:03:40,588 --> 00:03:43,456
We could decorate the roof
and make the guys wear tuxedos.

96
00:03:43,458 --> 00:03:45,357
Ooh, and get our hair done,
and slow-dance.

97
00:03:45,359 --> 00:03:46,625
Okay, guys, trust me,

98
00:03:46,627 --> 00:03:48,427
as someone who's been to,
like, seven proms,

99
00:03:48,429 --> 00:03:50,896
it is never as good
as you want it to be.

100
00:03:50,898 --> 00:03:53,599
You went to seven proms?

101
00:03:53,601 --> 00:03:54,800
Yeah, let's see.

102
00:03:54,802 --> 00:03:57,536
Uh, four "Under the Seas,"
two "Enchanted Evenings,"

103
00:03:57,538 --> 00:03:58,771
and one "Night to Remember"

104
00:03:58,773 --> 00:04:02,007
that... I cannot remember
for the life of me.

105
00:04:04,345 --> 00:04:05,711
Hey.

106
00:04:05,713 --> 00:04:07,413
Hey.
Hey, where's Bernadette?

107
00:04:07,415 --> 00:04:10,049
She and Amy are out dress
shopping for their prom thing.

108
00:04:10,051 --> 00:04:11,884
Oh, yeah,
I got that Evite.

109
00:04:11,886 --> 00:04:13,619
Ever since I saw<i> Pretty in Pink,</i>

110
00:04:13,621 --> 00:04:15,654
I've wanted to go
to an American prom.

111
00:04:17,191 --> 00:04:18,324
But then I saw<i> Carrie,</i>

112
00:04:18,326 --> 00:04:21,060
and I did not want to go
to an American prom.

113
00:04:21,062 --> 00:04:22,361
But then I saw
<i>Never Been Kissed,</i>

114
00:04:22,363 --> 00:04:23,929
and I'm back
on the prom bandwagon.

115
00:04:25,233 --> 00:04:28,234
This prom thing's been
a real roller coaster.

116
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:30,836
Bernie's really excited.

117
00:04:30,838 --> 00:04:33,072
I-I could tell because
her voice got so high,

118
00:04:33,074 --> 00:04:35,708
the beagle next door
started howling.

119
00:04:37,512 --> 00:04:38,711
Did you go to your prom?

120
00:04:38,713 --> 00:04:40,613
No.
(chuckles)

121
00:04:40,615 --> 00:04:43,182
I had a date
with a proper education.

122
00:04:44,719 --> 00:04:48,621
Instead of a tuxedo,
I dressed myself in good habits.

123
00:04:48,623 --> 00:04:49,755
Instead of spiked punch,

124
00:04:49,757 --> 00:04:52,291
I enjoyed the intoxicating
flavor of knowledge.

125
00:04:53,361 --> 00:04:54,827
Instead of
dancing in a gym,

126
00:04:54,829 --> 00:04:57,396
I shook my booty
to the seductive rhythms...

127
00:04:57,398 --> 00:04:59,064
Okay, okay.

128
00:04:59,066 --> 00:05:00,799
...of AP Calculus.

129
00:05:04,505 --> 00:05:05,838
How come you're not shopping
with Amy and Bernadette?

130
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:08,641
Let me guess, you think
the whole idea is lame?

131
00:05:08,643 --> 00:05:10,142
Well, who cares what I think?
What do you think?

132
00:05:10,144 --> 00:05:12,144
Hmm, to be honest,

133
00:05:12,146 --> 00:05:15,214
it's kind of a dream come true
to go to even a fake prom

134
00:05:15,216 --> 00:05:16,815
with a woman
as beautiful as you.

135
00:05:16,817 --> 00:05:19,485
Ugh, thanks a lot.

136
00:05:19,487 --> 00:05:21,287
What?

137
00:05:21,289 --> 00:05:25,424
Well, now I can't blow this
thing off without being a bitch.

138
00:05:25,426 --> 00:05:27,826
That sounds like a "yes"!

139
00:05:30,698 --> 00:05:34,066
Ooh, every single person
RSVP'd "yes."

140
00:05:34,068 --> 00:05:35,834
This is so exciting!

141
00:05:35,836 --> 00:05:38,170
(higher pitched):
Isn't this exciting?

142
00:05:38,172 --> 00:05:39,939
(dog howls)

143
00:05:41,275 --> 00:05:42,675
Yep.

144
00:05:42,677 --> 00:05:45,177
Look, even Stuart's
bringing a date.

145
00:05:45,179 --> 00:05:46,245
I wonder who it is.

146
00:05:46,247 --> 00:05:48,180
You know exactly
who it is.

147
00:05:48,182 --> 00:05:49,515
He's gonna bring my mom.

148
00:05:49,517 --> 00:05:51,050
Why did you even invite him?

149
00:05:51,052 --> 00:05:53,786
Because he's our friend,
and you two need to get along.

150
00:05:53,788 --> 00:05:55,221
And why can't
he take your mom?

151
00:05:55,223 --> 00:05:57,990
You took her
to your prom.

152
00:05:57,992 --> 00:06:01,894
I didn't "take" her;
she was a chaperone.

153
00:06:01,896 --> 00:06:05,030
I saw a picture of you two
dancing together.

154
00:06:05,032 --> 00:06:06,165
W-What was I gonna do?

155
00:06:06,167 --> 00:06:07,666
They were playing our song!

156
00:06:09,370 --> 00:06:11,670
I can't take
this anymore.

157
00:06:13,641 --> 00:06:15,374
(phone rings)

158
00:06:15,376 --> 00:06:16,342
Hello.

159
00:06:16,344 --> 00:06:17,610
WOLOWITZ:
Stuart, we have to talk.

160
00:06:17,612 --> 00:06:22,314
This thing with you and my mom,
I-I hate it.

161
00:06:22,316 --> 00:06:24,049
It's making me crazy.

162
00:06:24,051 --> 00:06:26,585
You and I were
friends for years,

163
00:06:26,587 --> 00:06:30,089
and now you're bringing my
mother to a party I'm going to?!

164
00:06:30,091 --> 00:06:31,557
What the hell?!

165
00:06:31,559 --> 00:06:34,126
I'm not bringing your mother,
I have a date.

166
00:06:34,128 --> 00:06:36,662
Oh, so now you're cheating
on my mother?

167
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:41,500
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

168
00:06:41,502 --> 00:06:42,968
Wha-What are you talking about?

169
00:06:42,970 --> 00:06:45,971
There's nothing weird going on
with me and your mother.

170
00:06:45,973 --> 00:06:48,841
MRS. WOLOWITZ: Stewie,
your bath is getting cold!

171
00:06:50,011 --> 00:06:52,211
I got to go, bye.

172
00:06:55,149 --> 00:06:56,615
(knocking on door)
SHELDON: Penny?

173
00:06:56,617 --> 00:06:57,850
(knocks)
Penny.

174
00:06:57,852 --> 00:06:59,084
(knocks)
Penny.

175
00:06:59,086 --> 00:07:00,452
(knocks)
Penny.

176
00:07:00,454 --> 00:07:02,187
(knocks)
Penny.

177
00:07:02,189 --> 00:07:04,523
You knocked more than usual.

178
00:07:04,525 --> 00:07:05,724
Next time I might be in a rush,

179
00:07:05,726 --> 00:07:07,293
it's good to have
a few in the bank.

180
00:07:07,295 --> 00:07:09,094
Okay, what's up?

181
00:07:09,096 --> 00:07:11,463
I'd like to discuss this party

182
00:07:11,465 --> 00:07:12,998
that Amy and Bernadette
are throwing.

183
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,168
Since you and I are both
reluctant to go,

184
00:07:16,170 --> 00:07:19,738
I think I've come up with a
perfect way for us to enjoy it.

185
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:21,140
Great, how?

186
00:07:21,142 --> 00:07:23,275
We pretend we're aliens.

187
00:07:26,514 --> 00:07:28,147
I'm not the best
at reading facial cues,

188
00:07:28,149 --> 00:07:31,016
but I'm gonna say that you love
it and want to hear more.

189
00:07:32,853 --> 00:07:34,586
Now,
in the beloved novel

190
00:07:34,588 --> 00:07:36,488
<i>Hitchhiker's Guide</i>
<i>to the Galaxy,</i>

191
00:07:36,490 --> 00:07:39,992
an alien named Ford Prefect
pretended to be human

192
00:07:39,994 --> 00:07:43,228
in order to blend in so that he
could write an entry about Earth

193
00:07:43,230 --> 00:07:45,397
for<i> The Hitchhiker's Guide</i>
<i>to the Galaxy,</i>

194
00:07:45,399 --> 00:07:48,000
which is a travel book
within the actual book,

195
00:07:48,002 --> 00:07:49,201
which is also called

196
00:07:49,203 --> 00:07:52,004
<i>The Hitchhiker's Guide</i>
<i>to the Galaxy.</i>

197
00:07:52,006 --> 00:07:54,840
Okay, just one question.

198
00:07:54,842 --> 00:07:56,108
What?

199
00:07:57,511 --> 00:08:00,312
My point is,
pretending to be an alien is

200
00:08:00,314 --> 00:08:02,681
a valuable coping mechanism
I've used many times.

201
00:08:02,683 --> 00:08:05,818
I did it the first time
I went to see you in a play.

202
00:08:07,621 --> 00:08:09,988
You had no idea
Commander Umfrumf

203
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:12,224
of Ceti Alpha Three
was in the audience.

204
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:16,128
Oh, d-don't worry,
he gave you seven thumbs up.

205
00:08:17,098 --> 00:08:18,931
Here's a question--

206
00:08:18,933 --> 00:08:22,134
as an alien pretending to be
human, are you planning

207
00:08:22,136 --> 00:08:26,939
to engage in any post-prom
mating rituals with Amy?

208
00:08:30,077 --> 00:08:33,812
There are post-prom
mating rituals?

209
00:08:33,814 --> 00:08:35,114
Not always.

210
00:08:35,116 --> 00:08:37,282
Unless your date drives
a van with an air mattress,

211
00:08:37,284 --> 00:08:39,151
then always.

212
00:08:41,021 --> 00:08:44,189
Well, if it's part of the prom
experience, then I'm open to it.

213
00:08:44,191 --> 00:08:46,925
You're kidding.

214
00:08:46,927 --> 00:08:49,862
I may be an alien,
but I have urges.

215
00:08:51,966 --> 00:08:54,900
If Amy wants to copulate
by firing her eggs into space,

216
00:08:54,902 --> 00:08:56,635
well, then,
I will happily catch them

217
00:08:56,637 --> 00:08:59,805
with the reproductive sac
on my upper flermin.

218
00:09:03,944 --> 00:09:06,311
I'm not the best
at reading facial cues,

219
00:09:06,313 --> 00:09:09,114
but I can see that
you're a little turned on.

220
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:14,887
You know, if you're not
gonna learn how to do this,

221
00:09:14,889 --> 00:09:16,555
they make some
pretty good clip-ons.

222
00:09:16,557 --> 00:09:19,958
Bruce Wayne doesn't
wear a clip-on.

223
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:24,329
Bruce Wayne doesn't make
his roommate tie it for him.

224
00:09:24,331 --> 00:09:27,199
His name is Alfred,
and, yes, he does.

225
00:09:29,703 --> 00:09:31,670
There, perfect.

226
00:09:31,672 --> 00:09:32,938
What, are you sure?

227
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:35,574
It's my first prom,
I want to do it correctly.

228
00:09:35,576 --> 00:09:37,810
I thought you were gonna
pretend to be an alien.

229
00:09:37,812 --> 00:09:40,279
I was, but Penny didn't want to.

230
00:09:40,281 --> 00:09:41,780
You didn't want to.

231
00:09:41,782 --> 00:09:45,684
Bernadette, Amy, Koothrappali
and Wolowitz didn't want to.

232
00:09:45,686 --> 00:09:48,954
And even I knew it was weird
to hire somebody.

233
00:09:53,661 --> 00:09:55,594
Was that a flask?

234
00:09:55,596 --> 00:09:56,995
Yes.

235
00:09:56,997 --> 00:09:59,031
I've decided to embrace
all of the traditions

236
00:09:59,033 --> 00:10:01,934
associated with prom,
including spiking the punch.

237
00:10:04,104 --> 00:10:06,371
You're gonna put alcohol
in the punch?

238
00:10:06,373 --> 00:10:09,074
Oh, no, this is
pomegranate juice.

239
00:10:09,076 --> 00:10:11,510
It's all the fun
of high school high jinks

240
00:10:11,512 --> 00:10:14,780
with the cell-protecting zip
of antioxidants.

241
00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:18,417
If you had ripped jeans
and a leather jacket,

242
00:10:18,419 --> 00:10:21,253
you'd be like the toughest kid
on the Disney Channel.

243
00:10:23,023 --> 00:10:25,991
So, anything else
planned for tonight?

244
00:10:25,993 --> 00:10:27,659
Oh, everything.

245
00:10:27,661 --> 00:10:30,395
Getting our picture taken,
slow-dancing,

246
00:10:30,397 --> 00:10:32,731
being elected prom king.

247
00:10:34,335 --> 00:10:36,802
Pointing out that
kings aren't elected.

248
00:10:38,772 --> 00:10:41,707
It's gonna be off the hook.

249
00:10:41,709 --> 00:10:44,276
And while you're at it,

250
00:10:44,278 --> 00:10:46,645
I know that at this age
your hormones are raging,

251
00:10:46,647 --> 00:10:48,614
but just because all
your friends are having sex

252
00:10:48,616 --> 00:10:49,915
doesn't mean you have to.

253
00:10:52,253 --> 00:10:53,785
Why would you say that?

254
00:10:53,787 --> 00:10:56,088
You know, 'cause...

255
00:10:56,090 --> 00:10:58,390
'cause a lot of people lose
their virginity on prom night.

256
00:10:58,392 --> 00:11:00,392
Penny implied the same thing.

257
00:11:00,394 --> 00:11:01,527
Is this true?

258
00:11:01,529 --> 00:11:03,462
Just relax, it's a joke.

259
00:11:03,464 --> 00:11:06,298
You don't have
hormones.

260
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:14,074
Advertise your product or brand here

261
00:11:19,786 --> 00:11:21,734
Wow, you look amazing.

262
00:11:21,870 --> 00:11:24,437
Thank you, so do you.

263
00:11:24,768 --> 00:11:26,701
Sheldon,
you look so handsome.

264
00:11:26,703 --> 00:11:28,970
Thank you.

265
00:11:30,173 --> 00:11:32,207
Sheldon, doesn't Amy look hot?

266
00:11:32,209 --> 00:11:35,410
That's got to put some starch
in the upper flermin.

267
00:11:37,481 --> 00:11:38,446
What's that?

268
00:11:38,448 --> 00:11:40,281
Oh, it's a scaly
genital organ

269
00:11:40,283 --> 00:11:41,983
that grows between
his shoulder blades.

270
00:11:41,985 --> 00:11:45,053
Try not to touch it
when you're dancing.

271
00:11:46,022 --> 00:11:47,255
Excuse me.

272
00:11:47,257 --> 00:11:48,556
Where are you going?

273
00:11:48,558 --> 00:11:49,824
I can't do this.

274
00:11:49,826 --> 00:11:51,326
And for your information,
Leonard,

275
00:11:51,328 --> 00:11:53,194
the upper flermin doesn't grow
between my shoulder blades,

276
00:11:53,196 --> 00:11:55,497
it grows out of the belly button
on my neck.

277
00:11:59,269 --> 00:12:02,404
He's right, I was thinking
of the lower flermin.

278
00:12:04,574 --> 00:12:08,309
Ooh, I'll, uh, text Stuart,
let him know we're close.

279
00:12:08,311 --> 00:12:09,911
That's a neat tattoo.

280
00:12:09,913 --> 00:12:13,314
Oh, thanks, it's Sally from
<i>Nightmare before Christmas.</i>

281
00:12:13,316 --> 00:12:14,549
Aw, that movie's
so cute.

282
00:12:14,551 --> 00:12:16,651
Do you like her because
you both have red hair?

283
00:12:16,653 --> 00:12:19,421
Uh, a little, but more
that she's covered in scars

284
00:12:19,423 --> 00:12:22,390
and can pull her own limbs off
and sew them back on.

285
00:12:24,194 --> 00:12:27,195
I like Cinderella.

286
00:12:28,632 --> 00:12:30,165
Did you know,
in the original book,

287
00:12:30,167 --> 00:12:32,200
the sisters cut off
their toes with knives

288
00:12:32,202 --> 00:12:34,102
in order to fit
in the glass slipper?

289
00:12:35,372 --> 00:12:38,239
I like "Bibbidi-Bobbidi-Boo."

290
00:12:39,609 --> 00:12:41,676
Hey, here comes
Stuart and his date.

291
00:12:41,678 --> 00:12:42,811
Oh, she's cute.

292
00:12:43,914 --> 00:12:45,647
Oh, my God.

293
00:12:45,649 --> 00:12:46,748
What?

294
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:47,682
That's Jeanie.

295
00:12:47,684 --> 00:12:48,650
That's Jeanie?!

296
00:12:48,652 --> 00:12:50,418
Who's Jeanie?
Don't say it.

297
00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:52,587
That's Howard's cousin
that he had sex with.

298
00:12:55,926 --> 00:12:57,892
She is my second cousin.

299
00:12:57,894 --> 00:13:00,562
We were 15... I just said,
"Don't say it."

300
00:13:00,564 --> 00:13:02,230
No, it's okay.

301
00:13:02,232 --> 00:13:04,098
He told me that story
a long time ago.

302
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:05,166
Raj!

303
00:13:05,168 --> 00:13:06,301
It was our first date,

304
00:13:06,303 --> 00:13:07,402
there was an
awkward silence.

305
00:13:07,404 --> 00:13:10,004
What was I
supposed to say?

306
00:13:14,244 --> 00:13:15,810
(gasps)

307
00:13:15,812 --> 00:13:17,979
Oh, it's beautiful.

308
00:13:17,981 --> 00:13:20,248
Oh, the girls really
did a nice job.

309
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:21,349
Aw...

310
00:13:21,351 --> 00:13:22,817
I know I wasn't
into this before,

311
00:13:22,819 --> 00:13:25,353
but I'm so glad I get
to take you to your first prom.

312
00:13:25,355 --> 00:13:27,355
What makes you think
I didn't go to my prom?

313
00:13:27,357 --> 00:13:29,357
I went.
Well, who'd you go with?

314
00:13:29,359 --> 00:13:33,328
I took a little lady
I like to call loneliness.

315
00:13:33,330 --> 00:13:34,496
Aw...

316
00:13:34,498 --> 00:13:35,864
Aw, it's all right.

317
00:13:35,866 --> 00:13:37,165
We ended up having a threesome

318
00:13:37,167 --> 00:13:39,133
with her friend humiliation,
so...

319
00:13:41,438 --> 00:13:43,738
Well, if I would have been
there and saw you alone,

320
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:45,006
I would've asked you
to dance.

321
00:13:45,008 --> 00:13:46,107
No, you wouldn't have.

322
00:13:46,109 --> 00:13:47,208
Well, you don't
know that.

323
00:13:47,210 --> 00:13:48,676
It was before
my growth spurt.

324
00:13:48,678 --> 00:13:49,811
What, that already happened?

325
00:13:49,813 --> 00:13:51,813
(imitates laughter)

326
00:13:51,815 --> 00:13:53,781
Very funny.

327
00:13:53,783 --> 00:13:55,350
Well, you wouldn't
have asked me either.

328
00:13:55,352 --> 00:13:56,584
I would have asked you.

329
00:13:56,586 --> 00:13:57,452
(scoffs)

330
00:13:57,454 --> 00:13:58,620
In my head.

331
00:13:58,622 --> 00:14:00,388
(chuckles)

332
00:14:00,390 --> 00:14:02,790
On the way home.

333
00:14:02,792 --> 00:14:05,059
While I was having a good cry.

334
00:14:09,399 --> 00:14:11,599
(knocking on door)

335
00:14:11,601 --> 00:14:12,867
Sheldon, can I come in?

336
00:14:12,869 --> 00:14:15,203
I don't think
that's a good idea.

337
00:14:15,205 --> 00:14:16,437
Why not?

338
00:14:16,439 --> 00:14:18,573
According to an online
message board,

339
00:14:18,575 --> 00:14:20,742
I may be having a panic attack.

340
00:14:20,744 --> 00:14:22,977
SoccerMom09 had
similar symptoms.

341
00:14:24,814 --> 00:14:29,117
But to be fair, the twins were
a real handful that day.

342
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:30,518
You're making me worry.

343
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:31,653
What's going on?

344
00:14:31,655 --> 00:14:35,557
What's going on is we're
about to go to a prom.

345
00:14:35,559 --> 00:14:36,691
And there's
a great deal of pressure

346
00:14:36,693 --> 00:14:38,660
on young couples
like us to engage in

347
00:14:38,662 --> 00:14:42,997
what Mr. Bob Eubanks
called making whoopee.

348
00:14:42,999 --> 00:14:44,632
What pressure?

349
00:14:44,634 --> 00:14:46,434
All I said was
you look handsome.

350
00:14:46,436 --> 00:14:49,170
Can you please
open the door?

351
00:14:49,172 --> 00:14:51,005
It's not just that.

352
00:14:51,007 --> 00:14:53,575
Leonard and Penny also
made comments about it.

353
00:14:53,577 --> 00:14:55,209
And I'm not blind.

354
00:14:55,211 --> 00:14:57,745
Even I looked twice
when I saw my posterior

355
00:14:57,747 --> 00:14:59,781
in these tuxedo pants.

356
00:15:01,952 --> 00:15:04,552
So, I met Jeanie
at your Aunt Gladys'.

357
00:15:04,554 --> 00:15:06,054
She passed me
the Manischewitz,

358
00:15:06,056 --> 00:15:07,755
I took one look
at this punim,

359
00:15:07,757 --> 00:15:10,925
and I almost plotzed
on the kugel.

360
00:15:12,729 --> 00:15:15,296
Is this what I sound like
when I talk about India?

361
00:15:18,168 --> 00:15:20,201
So, my mother's okay
with this?

362
00:15:20,203 --> 00:15:22,670
Why would your mother have
a problem with me and Stuart?

363
00:15:22,672 --> 00:15:25,773
'Cause they have a weird,
inappropriate relationship.

364
00:15:25,775 --> 00:15:29,210
Weirder than what you and I
did in my dad's Corolla?

365
00:15:32,182 --> 00:15:33,681
This is so messed up.

366
00:15:33,683 --> 00:15:36,784
I know, I'm having
the best time.

367
00:15:36,786 --> 00:15:39,621
Why would you even come to this?

368
00:15:39,623 --> 00:15:41,122
Didn't you know I'd be here?

369
00:15:41,124 --> 00:15:43,091
It was a long
time ago, Howard.

370
00:15:43,093 --> 00:15:45,259
And you're only second
cousins, who cares?

371
00:15:45,261 --> 00:15:47,729
So, you knew and you
brought her anyway?

372
00:15:47,731 --> 00:15:50,732
Oh, so she's good enough
for Howard, but not for me?!

373
00:15:50,734 --> 00:15:51,699
Yeah.

374
00:15:51,701 --> 00:15:52,700
Yeah, go have weird
relationships

375
00:15:52,702 --> 00:15:53,801
with your own
mother and cousin.

376
00:15:53,803 --> 00:15:54,803
This is his turf.

377
00:15:54,804 --> 00:15:56,004
Yeah.

378
00:15:59,476 --> 00:16:02,610
Well, I might not have
asked you to dance then,

379
00:16:02,612 --> 00:16:05,079
but I will ask you now.
There's no music.

380
00:16:05,081 --> 00:16:06,314
I don't care.

381
00:16:06,316 --> 00:16:07,515
We'll make
our own music.

382
00:16:07,517 --> 00:16:09,517
My God, who's the dork now?

383
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:10,685
(scoffs)

384
00:16:11,521 --> 00:16:13,721
(giggles)

385
00:16:17,460 --> 00:16:19,894
Thank you for
wearing your flats.

386
00:16:19,896 --> 00:16:22,096
Thank you for
wearing your heels.

387
00:16:24,501 --> 00:16:26,034
Mmm.

388
00:16:26,036 --> 00:16:27,368
Look at me.

389
00:16:27,370 --> 00:16:30,605
Dancing with the prettiest
girl at the prom.

390
00:16:30,607 --> 00:16:32,674
Want to take a picture
of us and send it

391
00:16:32,676 --> 00:16:35,410
to your old friends
in the chess club?

392
00:16:35,412 --> 00:16:38,312
I sent them a bikini shot
of you years ago.

393
00:16:41,484 --> 00:16:43,918
This is nice.

394
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:45,887
I kind of wish
no one else was coming.

395
00:16:45,889 --> 00:16:48,956
I know, me, too.

396
00:16:48,958 --> 00:16:52,794
But it will be fun to have a
prom without all the drama.

397
00:16:55,799 --> 00:16:57,265
Howie, get off of him!

398
00:16:57,267 --> 00:17:00,702
Not until he stops humping
his way up my family tree!

399
00:17:02,706 --> 00:17:05,306
Sheldon, this is silly.

400
00:17:05,308 --> 00:17:06,774
I'm not missing another prom.

401
00:17:06,776 --> 00:17:07,875
I'm going upstairs now.

402
00:17:07,877 --> 00:17:09,410
Good-bye.

403
00:17:09,412 --> 00:17:12,513
I really did think
you looked pretty.

404
00:17:12,515 --> 00:17:14,348
You did?

405
00:17:14,350 --> 00:17:16,684
Yes.

406
00:17:16,686 --> 00:17:19,087
So much so that
I started to panic.

407
00:17:19,089 --> 00:17:21,022
Well, you can relax.

408
00:17:21,991 --> 00:17:24,525
Just because you think
I look pretty

409
00:17:24,527 --> 00:17:26,961
doesn't mean we have
to spend the night together.

410
00:17:26,963 --> 00:17:30,598
Were you hoping we would
because it's prom?

411
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:32,934
I'm always hoping.

412
00:17:34,170 --> 00:17:38,506
But tonight I just wanted
to have a nice time with you.

413
00:17:38,508 --> 00:17:41,676
And maybe dance
with someone who has arms.

414
00:17:43,646 --> 00:17:45,413
Thank you for understanding.

415
00:17:45,415 --> 00:17:47,749
Of course I understand.

416
00:17:49,719 --> 00:17:52,286
Sheldon,

417
00:17:52,288 --> 00:17:54,288
there's something else
I've been wanting to say,

418
00:17:54,290 --> 00:17:56,257
but before I do,
I just...

419
00:17:56,259 --> 00:17:59,994
I want you to know that you
don't have to say it back.

420
00:17:59,996 --> 00:18:01,963
I know you're not ready,

421
00:18:01,965 --> 00:18:03,498
and I don't want you to say it

422
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:05,099
just because
social convention dictates...

423
00:18:05,101 --> 00:18:07,068
I love you, too.

424
00:18:10,573 --> 00:18:12,573
You said it.

425
00:18:12,575 --> 00:18:15,243
There's no denying
I have feelings for you

426
00:18:15,245 --> 00:18:17,612
that can't be explained
in any other way.

427
00:18:18,648 --> 00:18:22,650
I briefly considered
that I had a brain parasite.

428
00:18:25,121 --> 00:18:27,789
But that seems even
more farfetched.

429
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:32,794
The only conclusion was love.

430
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:38,432
I know what's happening.

431
00:18:39,769 --> 00:18:42,203
This is a panic attack.

432
00:18:42,205 --> 00:18:44,806
SoccerMom09 says to lie down
with your feet elevated.

433
00:18:44,808 --> 00:18:45,973
Okay.

434
00:18:45,975 --> 00:18:47,809
Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa.

435
00:18:47,811 --> 00:18:49,410
Just because I love you
doesn't mean

436
00:18:49,412 --> 00:18:51,345
girls are allowed in my room.

437
00:19:07,074 --> 00:19:08,974
Okay.

438
00:19:08,976 --> 00:19:10,676
Here we go...

439
00:19:10,678 --> 00:19:13,245
Say "Cheese"!

440
00:19:15,649 --> 00:19:18,150
Say "Cheese"!

441
00:19:20,654 --> 00:19:23,288
Say "Cousin"!

442
00:19:25,926 --> 00:19:27,626
Say...

443
00:19:27,628 --> 00:19:28,628
(cell phone rings)

444
00:19:28,629 --> 00:19:29,629
Oh, sorry.

445
00:19:29,630 --> 00:19:31,830
Hang on, sorry.

446
00:19:33,799 --> 00:19:35,567
Hey, Debbie.

447
00:19:35,569 --> 00:19:37,602
I... Yeah, yeah, I'm
here with Jeanie.

448
00:19:38,331 --> 00:19:40,473
Okay, but we're just friends.

449
00:19:40,682 --> 00:19:44,041
It's... Yeah. I got to go.
