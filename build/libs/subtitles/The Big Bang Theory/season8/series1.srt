1
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:11,320
Damn you,walletnook.Com!

2
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:13,650
Problem?

3
00:00:13,660 --> 00:00:16,100
The online description
was completely misleading.

4
00:00:16,110 --> 00:00:19,010
They said eight slots,plus removable id.

5
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:21,980
To any rational person,that
would mean room for nine cards,

6
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:25,350
but they don't tell you,the
removable id takes up one slot.

7
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:26,900
It's a nightmare!

8
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:32,490
Okay,now,do you really need the honorary
justice league of america membership card?

9
00:00:33,410 --> 00:00:36,510
It's been in every wallet
I've owned since I was five.

10
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:38,460
Why?

11
00:00:38,470 --> 00:00:40,720
It says "keep this on
your person at all times."

12
00:00:42,130 --> 00:00:44,600
it's right here under
batman's signature.

13
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:50,200
And this is leonard
and sheldon's apartment.

14
00:00:50,210 --> 00:00:53,020
Guess whose parents just got broadband.

15
00:00:53,030 --> 00:00:56,930
Leonard,may I present,live from new
delhi,dr.And mrs.V.M.Koothrappali.

16
00:00:56,940 --> 00:00:58,090
Hi!

17
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:01,100
Tilt up the camera up!
I'm looking at his crotch.

18
00:01:01,110 --> 00:01:02,120
Sorry,papa.

19
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:03,370
Oh,that's much better.

20
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:04,770
- Hi.
- Hi!

21
00:01:04,780 --> 00:01:07,390
And over here is sheldon.

22
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:08,530
Hi!

23
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:09,910
He lives with leonard.

24
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:11,380
Oh,that's nice.

25
00:01:11,390 --> 00:01:13,160
Like haroon and tanvir.

26
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:14,760
No,no. Not like haroon and tanvir.

27
00:01:14,770 --> 00:01:16,330
Such sweet young men.

28
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:19,820
They just adopted the
cutest little punjabi baby.

29
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:22,260
No,we're not like haroon and tanvir.

30
00:01:23,230 --> 00:01:25,370
So,are you boys academics like our son?

31
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:26,180
Yes.

32
00:01:26,190 --> 00:01:29,190
And your parents are comfortable
with your limited earning potential?

33
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:30,570
- Oh,yes.
- Not at all.

34
00:01:31,030 --> 00:01:32,520
Papa,please. Don't start.

35
00:01:32,530 --> 00:01:34,040
It was just a question.

36
00:01:34,050 --> 00:01:34,880
He's so sensitive.

37
00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:36,170
Okay,that's my life. That's my friends.

38
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:37,320
Good to see you. Say good-bye.

39
00:01:37,330 --> 00:01:38,530
- Bye.
- Bye.

40
00:01:38,540 --> 00:01:39,450
Wait! Wait!

41
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:43,630
Before you go,we have good news.

42
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:46,520
Put the computer down
and gather your friends.

43
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:52,260
- What is it,papa?
- friends.

44
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:58,660
Is it just me,or does web chatting with
your clothes on seem a little pointless?

45
00:01:58,670 --> 00:02:01,820
Rajesh,do you remember lalita gupta?

46
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:05,700
The little fat girl that used to kick me
in the samosas and call me untouchable?

47
00:02:05,710 --> 00:02:06,440
Yes.

48
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:09,000
Well,now she's a dental student at usc,

49
00:02:09,010 --> 00:02:11,910
so we gave her your contact information.

50
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:13,150
Why did you do that?

51
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:14,450
You're 26 years old,rajesh.

52
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:15,900
We want grandchildren.

53
00:02:15,910 --> 00:02:17,270
But,papa,I'm not supposed...

54
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,850
lalita's parents approved the match.

55
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:23,240
If you decide on a spring
wedding,we can avoid monsoon season.

56
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:24,420
A spring wedding?

57
00:02:24,430 --> 00:02:25,360
It's up to you,dear.

58
00:02:25,370 --> 00:02:26,600
We don't want to meddle.

59
00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:28,790
If you don't want to
meddle,then why are you meddling?

60
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:31,630
If I may,your parents probably
don't consider this meddling.

61
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:33,730
While arranged marriages
are no longer the norm,

62
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:38,050
indian parents continue to have a greater-than-average
involvement in their children's love lives.

63
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:40,680
Why are you telling me
about my own culture?

64
00:02:41,450 --> 00:02:43,360
You seemed confused.

65
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:46,240
Sorry,mumi,papa,but
with all due respect,

66
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:47,600
- I really don't want to...
- I'm sorry,darling.

67
00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:48,700
We have to go.

68
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:50,920
Doogie howser is on.

69
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:53,950
Grandma! It's doogie time!

70
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:55,760
- Bye-bye!
- Bye-bye!

71
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,420
I don't believe it.

72
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:01,610
Neither do I.

73
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:04,480
Doogie howser's been off
the air for like 20 years.

74
00:03:05,490 --> 00:03:09,020
Actually,I read somewhere that it's one
of the most popular programs in india.

75
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:13,350
It might speak to a cultural aspiration to have
one's children enter the medical profession.

76
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:14,610
I bet you're right.

77
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:15,980
I bet they love scrubs.

78
00:03:15,990 --> 00:03:17,210
What's not to love?

79
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:18,910
Excuse me! Hello?

80
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:21,040
My parents are trying to marry
me off to a total stranger.

81
00:03:21,050 --> 00:03:22,890
What am I going to do?

82
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:24,580
I suggest you go through with it.

83
00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:25,650
What?

84
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:30,150
Romantic love as the basis for marriage
has only existed since the 19th century.

85
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:34,330
Up until then,arranged marriages were
the norm,and it served society quite well.

86
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:36,100
It's the entire premise
of fiddler on the roof.

87
00:03:36,110 --> 00:03:39,310
I'm not a big fan of
musicals,but I love that show.

88
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:40,220
Me too.

89
00:03:40,230 --> 00:03:41,970
Of course,it speaks to me culturally.

90
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:46,550
Understandable,but there's a universality
to that story which transcends ethnicity.

91
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,520
Let's not forget it's got
some really catchy tunes.

92
00:03:48,530 --> 00:03:49,810
- oh,absolutely.
- Yeah!

93
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:51,890
Okay,I know what I'm going to do.

94
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:52,600
What?

95
00:03:52,610 --> 00:03:54,590
Find new friends.

96
00:04:00,090 --> 00:04:01,670
so who wants to rent fiddler?

97
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,910
No need,we have the special edition.

98
00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:08,610
Well,maybe we are
like haroon and tanvir.

this is dr.Sheldon cooper.

103
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:37,940
Yeah,I need to cancel my
membership to the planetarium.

104
00:04:40,210 --> 00:04:44,510
Well,I'm sorry,too,but there's
just no room for you in my wallet.

105
00:04:46,770 --> 00:04:50,590
I understand,but it was between you
and the museum of natural history,

106
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:53,380
and frankly,you don't have dinosaurs.

107
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:56,940
I'll miss you,too. Bye-bye.

108
00:04:58,060 --> 00:05:01,480
Okay,I know you're texting about
me and I'd really like you to stop.

109
00:05:03,950 --> 00:05:07,010
oh,dear,I am rightly and truly screwed.

110
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,330
Hey,I thought you were
finding new friends.

111
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:11,130
I've got some feelers out.

112
00:05:11,790 --> 00:05:13,790
In the meantime,listen to this.

113
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:16,140
Hi,rajesh. This is lalita gupta.

114
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:19,660
Uh,your mother gave my mother
your phone number to give to me.

115
00:05:19,670 --> 00:05:24,980
So,I'm calling you
and,uh,call me back. Bye.

116
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:28,810
Can you believe how pushy she is?

117
00:05:30,850 --> 00:05:32,370
So don't call her.

118
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:34,780
If I don't call her,I won't hear
the end of it from my parents.

119
00:05:34,790 --> 00:05:35,400
So call her.

120
00:05:35,410 --> 00:05:37,890
How can I call her? You
know I can't talk to women.

121
00:05:38,710 --> 00:05:40,380
I'm done. Anybody else?

122
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,280
- Give me the phone.
- Why?

123
00:05:42,290 --> 00:05:44,390
Just give it to me.

124
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:45,380
What are you doing?

125
00:05:45,390 --> 00:05:47,450
Don't worry. You'll thank me.

126
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:50,910
Hello,lalita?Raj koothrappali here.

127
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:56,600
Yes,it is good to talk to you,too.

128
00:05:58,570 --> 00:06:01,050
So what are you wearing?

129
00:06:03,550 --> 00:06:04,950
Oh,not important.

130
00:06:05,190 --> 00:06:08,400
Uh,so,anyhow,when
would you like to meet?

131
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,390
Friday works for me!

132
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:14,840
I'll call you with a time and place.

133
00:06:14,850 --> 00:06:17,970
But in the meantime,keep it real,babe.

134
00:06:24,170 --> 00:06:26,230
You may now thank me.

135
00:06:27,130 --> 00:06:29,940
For what? Making me sound
like a simpsons character?

136
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:32,130
Fine. Next time make your own date.

137
00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:33,510
I didn't want to make this one!

138
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:37,200
Look on the bright side,she might
turn out to be a nice,beautiful girl.

139
00:06:37,210 --> 00:06:38,530
Great,then we'll get married,

140
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:39,660
I won't be able to talk to her

141
00:06:39,670 --> 00:06:42,950
and we'll spend the rest of
our lives in total silence.

142
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,960
It worked for my parents.

143
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:47,690
- hi,guys.
- Oh,hey.

144
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:48,930
I need some guinea pigs.

145
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:53,660
Okay,there's a lab animal supply
company in reseda you could try.

146
00:06:53,670 --> 00:06:55,790
But if your research is going
to have human applications,

147
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:57,500
may I suggest white mice instead?

148
00:06:57,510 --> 00:07:00,650
Their brain chemistry
is far closer to ours.

149
00:07:02,010 --> 00:07:03,450
I swear to god,sheldon,one day,

150
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:05,820
I'm going to get the
hang of talking to you.

151
00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:09,400
His mom's been saying that for years.

152
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:12,220
What's up?

153
00:07:12,230 --> 00:07:15,320
Well,I finally convinced the restaurant
to give me a bartending shift,

154
00:07:15,330 --> 00:07:17,490
so I need to practice mixing drinks.

155
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:18,090
Oh,great.

156
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:21,550
Well,the key to acquiring
proficiency in any task is repetition.

157
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:24,220
With certain obvious exceptions.

158
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:26,960
Suicide,for example.

159
00:07:28,550 --> 00:07:30,390
So,leonard,how about it?

160
00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:33,450
You know,penny,we'd love to help you,

161
00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:35,870
but raj is going through
some stuff right now,

162
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:38,340
and besides,he doesn't drink,so...

163
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,570
really?

164
00:07:43,850 --> 00:07:48,090
Um,raj is going through some stuff right
now and he'd like to take up drinking.

165
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,080
Okay,here you go,leonard.

166
00:07:52,090 --> 00:07:53,920
One tequila sunrise.

167
00:07:53,930 --> 00:07:55,250
Thank you.

168
00:07:55,260 --> 00:07:57,020
You know,this drink is
a wonderful example of

169
00:07:57,030 --> 00:08:01,560
how liquids with different specific
gravities interact in a cylindrical container.

170
00:08:03,380 --> 00:08:04,700
Thank you.

171
00:08:05,690 --> 00:08:07,530
Okay,raj,what'll it be?

172
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:11,380
Whatever you recommend.

173
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:12,510
Uh,how about a grasshopper?

174
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:14,540
I make a mean grasshopper.

175
00:08:14,550 --> 00:08:16,030
Okay? Good.Coming up.

176
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:17,860
Sheldon,what are you going to have?

177
00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:20,090
I'll have a diet coke.

178
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:22,590
Okay,can you please order a cocktail?

179
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:24,520
I need to practice mixing drinks.

180
00:08:24,530 --> 00:08:25,170
Fine.

181
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:28,010
I'll have a virgin cuba libre.

182
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:32,400
That's,um,rum and coke without the rum.

183
00:08:32,410 --> 00:08:33,640
Yes.

184
00:08:35,230 --> 00:08:37,430
- So...coke.
- Yes.

185
00:08:38,810 --> 00:08:40,710
And would you make it diet?

186
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:47,710
There's a can in the fridge.

187
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:52,000
A cuba libre traditionally comes
in a tall glass with a lime wedge.

188
00:08:52,010 --> 00:08:54,140
Then swim to cuba.

189
00:08:56,070 --> 00:08:59,020
Bartenders are supposed
to have people skills.

190
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:01,480
Okay.

191
00:09:01,490 --> 00:09:03,280
Raj,here you go.

192
00:09:03,290 --> 00:09:04,800
All right. Who's next?

193
00:09:04,810 --> 00:09:07,360
I'd like to try a slippery nipple.

194
00:09:12,170 --> 00:09:14,160
Okay,you're cut off.

195
00:09:16,110 --> 00:09:18,020
Anybody need a refill?

196
00:09:18,030 --> 00:09:20,380
Where did my life go,penny?

197
00:09:22,310 --> 00:09:23,780
One day I'm a carefree bachelor,

198
00:09:23,790 --> 00:09:28,540
and the next I'm married and driving a minivan
to peewee cricket matches in suburban new delhi.

199
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:32,910
Are you talking to me?

200
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:35,360
Is there another penny here?

201
00:09:36,210 --> 00:09:37,620
I had such plans.

202
00:09:37,630 --> 00:09:38,900
I had dreams.

203
00:09:38,910 --> 00:09:42,530
I was going to be the indira
gandhi of particle astrophysics.

204
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:44,870
But with a penis,of course.

205
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:47,900
Amazing.

206
00:09:47,910 --> 00:09:49,130
Ever since I was a little boy,

207
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:52,210
my father wanted me to be
a gynecologist like him.

208
00:09:52,330 --> 00:09:53,790
How can I be a gynecologist?

209
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:56,700
I can barely look a woman in the eye!

210
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:00,920
You know what?

211
00:10:00,930 --> 00:10:03,450
I'm not going to let my parents
control my future any longer.

212
00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:05,250
It's time for a showdown.

213
00:10:05,260 --> 00:10:07,730
Somebody give me a
computer with a webcam!

214
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:11,730
Okay,sweetie,I think that's
the grasshopper talking.

215
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:13,000
And it's about to tell my parents that

216
00:10:13,010 --> 00:10:16,370
I'm not riding an elephant down
the aisle with lalita gupta.

217
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:18,480
Okay,calm down.

218
00:10:18,490 --> 00:10:21,550
Look,no one can make you get married.

219
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:23,840
Why don't you just meet this
girl and see what happens?

220
00:10:23,850 --> 00:10:24,870
Haven't you been listening to me?

221
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:26,440
I cannot talk to women.

222
00:10:26,450 --> 00:10:27,450
Um,raj...

223
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:29,770
no,no,let's see how long it takes him.

224
00:10:31,350 --> 00:10:34,260
Um,raj,honey,you say
you can't talk to women,

225
00:10:34,270 --> 00:10:36,290
but you've been talking to me.

226
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:38,560
And now we'll never know.

227
00:10:39,550 --> 00:10:41,560
You're right. I...

228
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:44,250
I am talking to you.

229
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:46,800
Hello,penny,how are you?

230
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:48,950
I'm fine.

231
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:53,030
Okay,now I just need to make sure I have
a lalita before I meet the grasshopper.

232
00:10:56,210 --> 00:10:59,200
It's a sweet,green miracle.

233
00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:01,300
Okay,if you're going
to drink on this date,

234
00:11:01,310 --> 00:11:03,310
just promise me you won't overdo it.

235
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:04,790
Overdo what?

236
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,310
Happiness?

237
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:08,420
Freedom?

238
00:11:08,430 --> 00:11:13,660
This warm glow inside of me that promises
everything's going to be all hunky-dunky?

239
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:15,890
Yeah,that.

240
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:17,090
Why don't you bring her to my restaurant

241
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:19,240
while I'm tending the bar
so I can keep an eye on you.

242
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:20,900
Okay.

243
00:11:21,850 --> 00:11:23,270
Wait a minute. What's the plan here?

244
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:25,090
Let's say he meets her,he
likes her,they get married.

245
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:28,280
What's he going to do,stay
drunk for the rest of his life?

246
00:11:28,290 --> 00:11:30,560
Worked for my parents.

247
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:38,074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

248
00:11:41,590 --> 00:11:45,150
I can't believe I'm sitting
here next to little lalita gupta.

249
00:11:46,370 --> 00:11:47,750
Well,you are.

250
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:50,070
Little lalita.

251
00:11:50,550 --> 00:11:52,200
That's fd of kinun to say.

252
00:11:52,210 --> 00:11:54,910
Little lalita,little
lalita,little lalita.

253
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:56,390
You should try it.

254
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:58,010
Oh,it's okay.

255
00:12:00,730 --> 00:12:03,380
You have lost so much weight.

256
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:07,720
That must have been difficult for
you because you were so,so fat.

257
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:10,720
Do you remember?

258
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:11,910
Yes,I do.

259
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:12,660
Of course you do.

260
00:12:12,670 --> 00:12:15,300
Who could forget being that fat?

261
00:12:16,790 --> 00:12:18,790
Well,I've been trying.

262
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:21,010
So you're a dental student.

263
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:27,210
Mm,are you aware that dentists
have an extremely high suicide rate?

264
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:30,150
Not as high as,say,air
traffic controllers,but,then,

265
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:32,270
there are far mo dreentists
than air traffic controllers,

266
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:34,880
so in pure numbers,you're still winning.

267
00:12:34,890 --> 00:12:36,550
Yay,me.

268
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:40,580
Do you have a drink that
will make him less obnoxious?

269
00:12:40,590 --> 00:12:42,980
Drinks do not work that way.

270
00:12:43,950 --> 00:12:45,520
I'd say he's doing fine. Look at her.

271
00:12:45,530 --> 00:12:49,600
The last girl my mom set me up with
had a mustache and a vestigial tail.

272
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:52,840
Sorry I'm late.

273
00:12:52,850 --> 00:12:53,790
What happened?

274
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:56,180
Nothing. I just really
didn't want to come.

275
00:12:58,140 --> 00:13:01,190
Virgin diet cuba libre,please.

276
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:02,190
Okay.

277
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:05,260
In a tall glass with a lime wedge.

278
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:08,070
Oh,I'll wedge it right in there.

279
00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:11,630
So how's koothrappali...

280
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:13,290
oh,my lord.

281
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:14,160
What?

282
00:13:14,170 --> 00:13:16,370
That's princess panchali.

283
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:18,160
I'm pretty sure her name's lalita.

284
00:13:18,170 --> 00:13:22,620
No,no,princess panchali,from
the monkey and the princess.

285
00:13:22,630 --> 00:13:23,620
Oh,yeah.

286
00:13:23,630 --> 00:13:27,030
I tried to watch that online,but
they wanted my credit card.

287
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:29,900
It's a children's story.

288
00:13:29,910 --> 00:13:31,900
Oh,no,it isn'T.

289
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:36,650
When I was a little boy and got sick,

290
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:39,510
which was most of the time,my
mother would read it to me.

291
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:42,790
It's about an indian princess
who befriends a monkey

292
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:46,050
who was mocked by all the other
monkeys because he was different.

293
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:48,870
For some reason,I related
to it quite strongly.

294
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:51,730
I know the reason.

295
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:54,340
We all know the reason.

296
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:57,100
Sheldon,what are you getting at?

297
00:13:57,110 --> 00:14:01,400
That woman looks exactly like the
pictures of princess panchali in the book.

298
00:14:01,410 --> 00:14:05,310
How often does one see a beloved
fictional character come to life?

299
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:07,680
Every year at comic-con.

300
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:09,570
Every day at disneyland.

301
00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:12,140
You can hire snow white
to come to your house.

302
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:15,130
Of course,they prefer
it if you have a kid.

303
00:14:15,870 --> 00:14:16,850
Hey,guys.

304
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:18,040
Isth is lalita gupta.

305
00:14:18,050 --> 00:14:21,530
Lalita,this is leonard and
sheldon and howard and penny.

306
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:24,250
Isn't it great? She isn't fat anymore.

307
00:14:25,090 --> 00:14:27,660
Forgive me,your highness,for
I am but a monkey,

308
00:14:27,670 --> 00:14:29,560
and it is in my nature to climb

309
00:14:29,570 --> 00:14:33,000
I did not mean to gaze upon
you as you comb your hair.

310
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:35,760
I'm sorry?

311
00:14:35,770 --> 00:14:39,460
You are the living embodiment of
the beautiful princess panchali.

312
00:14:39,470 --> 00:14:41,060
Oh,no kidding.

313
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:42,750
Who... who is that?

314
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:45,500
A beloved character
from an indian folktale.

315
00:14:47,340 --> 00:14:50,330
Us indian or "come
to our casino" indian?

316
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:53,070
You indian.

317
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:56,380
The resemblance is remarkable.

318
00:14:56,390 --> 00:15:00,370
I can practically smell the lotus
blossoms woven into your ebony hair.

319
00:15:00,380 --> 00:15:01,990
Well,thanks.

320
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,780
I imagine you smell very nice,too.

321
00:15:04,790 --> 00:15:08,470
I shower twice a day and wash
my hands as often as I can.

322
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:10,790
Really? So do I.

323
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:13,320
But you're a dentist. He's nuts.

324
00:15:14,950 --> 00:15:16,450
Don't be insulting,rajesh.

325
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:21,370
So,sheldon,tell me more about
this princess you say I look like.

326
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:25,480
It was said that the gods
fashioned her eyes out of the stars

327
00:15:25,490 --> 00:15:29,860
and that roses were ashamed to bloom
in the presence of her ruby lips.

328
00:15:30,260 --> 00:15:31,540
Oh,my.

329
00:15:31,550 --> 00:15:33,140
Back off,sheldon.

330
00:15:33,150 --> 00:15:33,740
What?

331
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:34,990
If you do not stop hitting on my lady,

332
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,710
you will feel the full
extent of my wrath.

333
00:15:38,950 --> 00:15:40,400
I'm not hitting on her.

334
00:15:40,410 --> 00:15:41,940
And I am not your lady.

335
00:15:41,950 --> 00:15:44,410
And you have no wrath.

336
00:15:45,950 --> 00:15:46,990
You are my lady.

337
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,160
Our parents said so.

338
00:15:48,170 --> 00:15:51,170
We are,for all intents and
purposes,100% hooked up.

339
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:52,780
Okay,let's get something straight here.

340
00:15:52,790 --> 00:15:55,950
The only reason I came tonight
was to get my parents off my case.

341
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:58,680
I certainly don't need to be
getting this old world crap from you.

342
00:15:58,690 --> 00:16:02,910
That's exactly the kind of spirit with which
princess panchali led the monkeys to freedom.

343
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:04,290
Screw princess panchali.

344
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:05,510
Hey,you can't talk to me like that.

345
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:07,240
But you're not princess panchali.

346
00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:09,810
Luckily for you-- she
could have you beheaded.

347
00:16:10,630 --> 00:16:11,930
Sheldon,are you hungry?

348
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:13,150
I could eat.

349
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:14,720
Let's go.

350
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:19,530
What just happened?

351
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:21,360
Beats the hell out of me.

352
00:16:21,370 --> 00:16:22,300
I'll tell you what happened.

353
00:16:22,310 --> 00:16:24,960
I just learned how to
pick up indian chicks.

354
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:30,280
What are we supposed to
say to lalita's parents?

355
00:16:30,290 --> 00:16:31,460
I play golf with her father.

356
00:16:31,470 --> 00:16:33,070
I won't be able to look at him.

357
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:35,740
Maybe you should keep
your eye on the ball,papa.

358
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:37,510
Oh,now you're a funny man.

359
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:39,990
This is not funny,mr.Funny man.

360
00:16:40,650 --> 00:16:42,770
Dr.And mrs.Koothrappali,in all fairness,

361
00:16:42,780 --> 00:16:44,840
it wasn't entirely raj's fault.

362
00:16:44,850 --> 00:16:46,470
This is a family matter,sheldon.

363
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:47,760
I'm leonard.

364
00:16:47,770 --> 00:16:50,650
Oh,sorry. You all look alike to us.

365
00:16:52,230 --> 00:16:53,040
But he's right,papa.

366
00:16:53,050 --> 00:16:54,770
Listen to him.

367
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:57,630
You! You are the one
who ruined everything.

368
00:16:57,640 --> 00:16:59,340
Who is it? We can't see.

369
00:16:59,350 --> 00:17:01,640
Turn us. Turn us.

370
00:17:04,010 --> 00:17:07,290
Go ahead,tell my parents why
they won't have any grandchildren.

371
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:08,210
How would I know?

372
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:10,340
Do you have a low sperm count?

373
00:17:11,930 --> 00:17:14,170
This has nothing to
do with my sperm count.

374
00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:17,190
You are wearing the boxers that
we sent you,aren't you,rajesh?

375
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:17,970
Yes,mumi.

376
00:17:17,980 --> 00:17:22,160
Because you know what happens to the
samosas when you wear tighty-whities.

377
00:17:22,850 --> 00:17:25,310
Can we please stop
talking about my testicles?

378
00:17:25,690 --> 00:17:27,280
Sheldon,tell them what you did.

379
00:17:27,290 --> 00:17:28,750
What did I do?

380
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:30,630
You left with his date.

381
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:32,970
Friends don't do that to each other.

382
00:17:34,830 --> 00:17:36,870
All right,noted.

383
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:39,490
Sorry.

384
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:41,250
Sorry? That's all you can say is sorry?

385
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:43,890
Take it,raj. It's more
than I've ever gotten.

386
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:46,420
And may I point out,she woavdn't
hule asked me to go with her

387
00:17:46,430 --> 00:17:48,180
if you hadn't been drunk and boring.

388
00:17:48,190 --> 00:17:48,900
Drunk?

389
00:17:48,910 --> 00:17:51,410
And boring--
her words.

390
00:17:51,630 --> 00:17:52,340
I knew it.

391
00:17:52,350 --> 00:17:54,470
He moves to america and
he becomes an alcoholic.

392
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:56,080
I'm not an alcoholic.

393
00:17:56,090 --> 00:17:57,600
Then why were you drunk?

394
00:17:57,610 --> 00:18:00,190
It was just this one time,papa,I swear.

395
00:18:00,210 --> 00:18:01,180
Are you in denial?

396
00:18:01,190 --> 00:18:03,320
Do we have to come over
and do an intervention?

397
00:18:03,330 --> 00:18:06,090
Don't embarrass him in
front of his friends.

398
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:07,140
All right.

399
00:18:07,150 --> 00:18:08,110
Carry us outside.

400
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:10,540
We want to talk to you in private.

401
00:18:11,030 --> 00:18:13,070
- But,papa,please...
- now,rajesh!

402
00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:18,670
I have to go.

403
00:18:20,570 --> 00:18:21,260
Now,listen to me...

404
00:18:21,270 --> 00:18:23,550
at least wait till I get into the hall.

405
00:18:27,410 --> 00:18:29,040
okay,well,good night.

406
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:30,830
Hold on.

407
00:18:31,270 --> 00:18:33,730
What happened with you and lalita?

408
00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:37,750
We ate,she lectured me on the link
between gum disease and heart attacks--

409
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:41,080
nothing I didn't already
know-- and I came home.

410
00:18:41,090 --> 00:18:43,530
So you're not going to see her again?

411
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:45,360
Why would I see her again?

412
00:18:45,370 --> 00:18:47,880
I already have a dentist.

413
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:56,280
I wonder who's going to tell his
parents they're not having grandchildren?

414
00:19:00,270 --> 00:19:03,070
To life,to life,l'chaim

415
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:06,080
l'chaim,l'chaim,to life

416
00:19:06,410 --> 00:19:10,960
life has a way of amusing us
blessing and bruising us drink,

417
00:19:10,970 --> 00:19:15,000
l'chaim,to li...fe.

418
00:19:17,610 --> 00:19:19,370
I don't believe it.
What's gotten into him?

419
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:25,010
maybe a couple virgin cuba libres
that turned out to be kind of slutty.

420
00:19:26,390 --> 00:19:27,440
You didn'T.

421
00:19:27,450 --> 00:19:30,000
Hey,you do your experiments. I do mine.
