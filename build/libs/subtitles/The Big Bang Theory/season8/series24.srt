1
00:00:06,605 --> 00:00:09,808
Can you believe it's been
five years since our first date?

2
00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:12,378
I know.

3
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:17,282
Do you think I should start
watching<i> The Flash</i> TV show?

4
00:00:20,387 --> 00:00:23,088
That's what
you're thinking about?

5
00:00:23,090 --> 00:00:25,024
Well, one of the things.

6
00:00:25,026 --> 00:00:28,494
Are any of them me?

7
00:00:28,496 --> 00:00:29,528
Yes.

8
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:31,263
I thought, "I can't decide

9
00:00:31,265 --> 00:00:33,165
"if I should watch
<i>The Flash</i> TV show.

10
00:00:33,167 --> 00:00:35,067
I know, I'll ask Amy."

11
00:00:36,336 --> 00:00:38,404
Anyway...

12
00:00:39,873 --> 00:00:41,673
What are you doing?

13
00:00:41,675 --> 00:00:44,510
You're right, you did
kind of kill the mood.

14
00:00:45,478 --> 00:00:46,879
I didn't kill anything.

15
00:00:46,881 --> 00:00:49,815
You did, talking about
your stupid TV show.

16
00:00:49,817 --> 00:00:51,517
Excuse me.

17
00:00:51,519 --> 00:00:54,553
Starting to watch a television
show that might run for years

18
00:00:54,555 --> 00:00:56,021
isn't a decision
to take lightly.

19
00:00:56,023 --> 00:00:57,623
I'm wrestling with

20
00:00:57,625 --> 00:00:59,458
a big commitment issue here.

21
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:00,893
Really?

22
00:01:00,895 --> 00:01:04,630
That's the commitment issue
you're wrestling with?

23
00:01:04,632 --> 00:01:05,898
Sheldon,

24
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:07,733
do you understand the irony

25
00:01:07,735 --> 00:01:10,135
of your fixation on a man
with super speed,

26
00:01:10,137 --> 00:01:12,871
while after five years
all I can get out of you

27
00:01:12,873 --> 00:01:15,441
is a distracted make-out session
on a couch?

28
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:19,311
Irony's not really
my strong suit.

29
00:01:20,447 --> 00:01:22,247
But I have been getting better
with sarcasm,

30
00:01:22,249 --> 00:01:24,616
if you want to give that a try.

31
00:01:24,618 --> 00:01:27,119
(sarcastically):
Oh, sure, I'd love to.

32
00:01:28,755 --> 00:01:30,856
Whenever you're ready.

33
00:01:32,292 --> 00:01:35,894
? Our whole universe
was in a hot, dense state ?

34
00:01:35,896 --> 00:01:39,198
? Then nearly 14 billion years
ago expansion started... Wait! ?

35
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,866
? The Earth began to cool ?

36
00:01:40,868 --> 00:01:43,569
? The autotrophs began to drool,
Neanderthals developed tools ?

37
00:01:43,571 --> 00:01:46,071
? We built the Wall ?
?<i> We built the pyramids</i> ?

38
00:01:46,073 --> 00:01:48,774
? Math, Science, History,
unraveling the mystery ?

39
00:01:48,776 --> 00:01:50,676
? That all started
with a big bang ?

40
00:01:50,678 --> 00:01:52,377
?<i> Bang!</i> ?

41
00:01:59,352 --> 00:02:00,953
I don't want to rush you,

42
00:02:00,955 --> 00:02:02,888
but I'm closing
a little early tonight.

43
00:02:02,890 --> 00:02:05,057
Ooh. Hot date?

44
00:02:05,059 --> 00:02:07,493
Uh, no. I overheard
Bernadette tell Howard

45
00:02:07,495 --> 00:02:09,061
she was making him a meat loaf,

46
00:02:09,063 --> 00:02:11,463
and you don't have
to not ask me twice.

47
00:02:13,066 --> 00:02:16,335
If I stick a lightbulb on this,
wouldn't it make a great lamp

48
00:02:16,337 --> 00:02:18,737
for my bedroom?

49
00:02:18,739 --> 00:02:21,507
You're kidding, right?

50
00:02:21,509 --> 00:02:23,542
Oh. Is this freaking you out?

51
00:02:23,544 --> 00:02:26,478
I guess I'm just more
of a Pottery Barn,

52
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,380
Crate and Barrel kind of guy.

53
00:02:29,749 --> 00:02:32,351
Maybe Pier 1
if I really want to cut loose.

54
00:02:32,353 --> 00:02:35,053
All right. Never mind.

55
00:02:35,055 --> 00:02:37,022
No, no, no.
Hey, you should totally get it.

56
00:02:37,024 --> 00:02:38,524
In fact, I'll buy it for you.

57
00:02:38,526 --> 00:02:39,825
Sold!

58
00:02:41,861 --> 00:02:43,896
Raj, you don't have to do that.

59
00:02:43,898 --> 00:02:45,664
Too late!
No returns!

60
00:02:48,067 --> 00:02:50,936
That was really intense.

61
00:02:50,938 --> 00:02:53,739
Well, now we know, next time
we go to the farmers' market,

62
00:02:53,741 --> 00:02:57,809
the order is petting zoo first,
then buy vegetables.

63
00:03:00,713 --> 00:03:02,381
Hey.

64
00:03:02,383 --> 00:03:05,050
Oh, good. You're here.
I need your assistance.

65
00:03:05,052 --> 00:03:07,653
Can it wait until I put
a Band-Aid on a goat bite?

66
00:03:09,289 --> 00:03:10,956
What happened?
Oh.

67
00:03:10,958 --> 00:03:13,392
Your buddy got mugged
by some baby farm animals.

68
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:16,395
Been there.
Mmm.

69
00:03:16,397 --> 00:03:18,330
So what do you need help with?

70
00:03:18,332 --> 00:03:21,500
Amy's mad at me,
and I'm not clear why.

71
00:03:21,502 --> 00:03:23,835
Okay. Were you talking
before she got upset?

72
00:03:23,837 --> 00:03:25,370
Yes.
That's probably it.

73
00:03:26,339 --> 00:03:28,473
What'd you say to her?

74
00:03:28,475 --> 00:03:30,642
Well, I just asked her
if I should start watching

75
00:03:30,644 --> 00:03:32,344
the new<i> Flash</i> TV series.

76
00:03:32,346 --> 00:03:33,845
And that made her angry?

77
00:03:33,847 --> 00:03:35,847
Baffling, right? We were necking

78
00:03:35,849 --> 00:03:38,684
like a couple of hooligans
under the school bleachers.

79
00:03:38,686 --> 00:03:41,320
I stopped so I could ask
the question.

80
00:03:41,322 --> 00:03:46,058
Next thing I know, good-bye,
kissy face. Hello, yelly face.

81
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:48,193
Well, Sheldon, when
you're kissing a girl,

82
00:03:48,195 --> 00:03:50,596
she expects the
attention to be on her.

83
00:03:50,598 --> 00:03:52,264
It was. I asked her

84
00:03:52,266 --> 00:03:54,933
if<i> she</i> thought
I should watch<i> The Flash.</i>

85
00:03:54,935 --> 00:03:58,170
Yeah. I'm tapping out.
Leonard?

86
00:03:58,172 --> 00:04:00,572
I'm gonna guess that your main
concern is the time commitment

87
00:04:00,574 --> 00:04:02,941
of watching an entire season
of a new show.

88
00:04:02,943 --> 00:04:04,276
Oh, no, not just a season.

89
00:04:04,278 --> 00:04:06,278
If I'm in,
I'm in for the whole run,

90
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:09,147
even if the quality declines.

91
00:04:09,149 --> 00:04:11,850
I get it.
<i>Smallville</i> almost wrecked you.

92
00:04:11,852 --> 00:04:14,586
Yeah. Exactly.

93
00:04:14,588 --> 00:04:15,921
You know, I waited ten years

94
00:04:15,923 --> 00:04:18,423
to see a guy
everyone knows can fly, fly.

95
00:04:18,425 --> 00:04:20,759
Wait, what is wrong
with you two?

96
00:04:20,761 --> 00:04:23,328
He was talking about television
during their date night.

97
00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:26,331
Oh, not just date night...
Our fifth anniversary.

98
00:04:26,333 --> 00:04:28,133
Okay, see, that's even dumber
than you wondering

99
00:04:28,135 --> 00:04:31,703
if being bitten by a goat would
give you the powers of a goat.

100
00:04:33,806 --> 00:04:36,141
If that happens,
don't make me wait ten years

101
00:04:36,143 --> 00:04:38,277
to watch you eat a tin can.

102
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:43,782
You guys ever notice that Emily
has a bit of a twisted side?

103
00:04:43,784 --> 00:04:45,684
You mean
'cause she has weird tattoos?

104
00:04:45,686 --> 00:04:48,654
No, because she wants to have
sex with me in a graveyard.

105
00:04:50,657 --> 00:04:53,625
One more time?

106
00:04:53,627 --> 00:04:55,627
She and I were supposed to watch

107
00:04:55,629 --> 00:04:57,696
the new<i> Avengers</i> movie tonight,
but it was sold out.

108
00:04:57,698 --> 00:04:59,865
So I said,
"What else do you want to do?"

109
00:04:59,867 --> 00:05:01,433
She said,
"Let's go to a cemetery

110
00:05:01,435 --> 00:05:03,969
and do it on somebody's grave."

111
00:05:03,971 --> 00:05:08,473
Like, a random person
or somebody she knew?

112
00:05:08,475 --> 00:05:11,343
What difference
does it make?

113
00:05:11,345 --> 00:05:12,944
Well, if it's

114
00:05:12,946 --> 00:05:14,746
her father's grave
and they didn't get along,

115
00:05:14,748 --> 00:05:16,982
then you know
she holds a grudge.

116
00:05:18,418 --> 00:05:20,852
The only issue is that everybody
has their own thing.

117
00:05:20,854 --> 00:05:22,487
And as long
as it's two consenting adults,

118
00:05:22,489 --> 00:05:24,356
I guess
I don't see the harm in it.

119
00:05:24,358 --> 00:05:25,957
Well, what if it's
one consenting adult

120
00:05:25,959 --> 00:05:27,592
and one adult who
pretends to consent

121
00:05:27,594 --> 00:05:29,261
because he's afraid
of being alone?

122
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:32,764
Well, then I guess
bring a blanket.

123
00:05:32,766 --> 00:05:34,633
The grass gets damp at night.

124
00:05:36,869 --> 00:05:38,303
I don't know, guys.

125
00:05:38,305 --> 00:05:40,272
Maybe this relationship
isn't for me.

126
00:05:40,274 --> 00:05:42,474
Maybe I should break up
with her.

127
00:05:42,476 --> 00:05:44,376
(chuckles) Right. You're gonna
break up with a girl

128
00:05:44,378 --> 00:05:46,945
who has sex with you.
Can you believe this guy?

129
00:05:46,947 --> 00:05:51,083
I think if Raj wants to break up
with a girl, he can do it.

130
00:05:51,085 --> 00:05:52,884
How are you saying that
with a straight face?

131
00:05:52,886 --> 00:05:54,920
(chuckling):
I don't know.

132
00:05:56,489 --> 00:05:58,090
You guys are being jerks.

133
00:05:58,092 --> 00:06:00,392
Buddy, other than Jenny Craig,

134
00:06:00,394 --> 00:06:03,061
you've never broken up
with a girl in your life.

135
00:06:03,063 --> 00:06:04,296
You're one
to talk.

136
00:06:04,298 --> 00:06:05,497
You've been complaining
about Stuart

137
00:06:05,499 --> 00:06:06,832
living here for the past year.

138
00:06:06,834 --> 00:06:08,467
I don't see you showing him
the door.

139
00:06:08,469 --> 00:06:09,701
That's not the
same thing.

140
00:06:09,703 --> 00:06:11,069
Emily's a person.

141
00:06:11,071 --> 00:06:12,738
Stuart's more like
an infestation,

142
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:14,106
something you spray for.

143
00:06:15,074 --> 00:06:17,075
Baloney, okay?
You two are

144
00:06:17,077 --> 00:06:19,878
as afraid of hurting
someone's feelings as I am.

145
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:22,247
That's not true. We were just
laughing right in your face.

146
00:06:25,418 --> 00:06:27,652
Thanks for cooking.
Mmm.
My pleasure.

147
00:06:27,654 --> 00:06:30,722
That carrot
was delicious.
Yeah.

148
00:06:30,724 --> 00:06:33,091
I wish I'd fought harder
for the rest of 'em.

149
00:06:36,996 --> 00:06:38,997
Still haven't heard
from her?

150
00:06:38,999 --> 00:06:41,533
No, and I'm confused.

151
00:06:41,535 --> 00:06:43,668
It's been nearly 24 hours.

152
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:47,305
Amy should have figured out
she's wrong by now.

153
00:06:48,641 --> 00:06:50,175
Hey, I don't think she's wrong

154
00:06:50,177 --> 00:06:52,377
about you going too slow
in the relationship.

155
00:06:52,379 --> 00:06:53,712
Too slow?

156
00:06:53,714 --> 00:06:54,880
Yeah, you've been
going out

157
00:06:54,882 --> 00:06:56,848
for years.
You haven't even slept together.

158
00:06:56,850 --> 00:07:00,018
That's right.
It's called foreplay.

159
00:07:01,754 --> 00:07:03,422
And I could make the case

160
00:07:03,424 --> 00:07:06,024
that you two aren't moving
forward in your relationship.

161
00:07:06,026 --> 00:07:07,125
(scoffs)
Uh,

162
00:07:07,127 --> 00:07:08,860
hello.

163
00:07:09,829 --> 00:07:11,396
Hello.

164
00:07:16,102 --> 00:07:18,437
No. Sheldon,
we're getting married.

165
00:07:18,439 --> 00:07:20,806
But you've been engaged
for over a year now,

166
00:07:20,808 --> 00:07:22,374
and you don't even have
a wedding date.

167
00:07:22,376 --> 00:07:24,443
Well, we will. We're
just not in a rush.

168
00:07:24,445 --> 00:07:26,378
Okay.

169
00:07:28,114 --> 00:07:30,115
We're gonna set a date.

170
00:07:30,117 --> 00:07:32,851
Okay. If you say so.

171
00:07:32,853 --> 00:07:34,586
Yeah, it's just, things
are good right now.
Really good.

172
00:07:34,588 --> 00:07:36,788
I'm focusing on my job.
And we've been busy
with our paper.

173
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:38,990
So busy.
Yeah, we'll pick a date
when we pick a date.

174
00:07:38,992 --> 00:07:40,058
Yeah.

175
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:43,228
Okay.

176
00:07:43,230 --> 00:07:45,297
You know, I can see
why Amy's mad at you.

177
00:07:45,299 --> 00:07:46,765
Yeah, shut up,
Sheldon!

178
00:07:49,502 --> 00:07:51,670
Did you eat
all my yogurt?

179
00:07:51,672 --> 00:07:53,805
You mean the one that
makes ladies do the thing

180
00:07:53,807 --> 00:07:55,207
that ladies pretend
they don't do

181
00:07:55,209 --> 00:07:57,876
even though they do?

182
00:07:59,879 --> 00:08:01,947
You know...

183
00:08:01,949 --> 00:08:04,583
which yogurt I mean.

184
00:08:04,585 --> 00:08:07,419
I didn't touch it.
Must have been Stuart.

185
00:08:07,421 --> 00:08:09,287
(sighs)
Maybe Raj is right.

186
00:08:09,289 --> 00:08:11,690
Maybe it's time we tell him
he needs to move out.

187
00:08:11,692 --> 00:08:13,558
We should have done
it months ago.

188
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:15,160
I know, but his store
was reopening,

189
00:08:15,162 --> 00:08:17,696
and then there were the
holidays, and then he was sick.

190
00:08:17,698 --> 00:08:19,130
(groans)
Yeah, right.

191
00:08:19,132 --> 00:08:21,333
Sick. He didn't have jaundice.

192
00:08:21,335 --> 00:08:23,602
He just looks like that.

193
00:08:28,741 --> 00:08:31,409
All right.
Tonight's the night.

194
00:08:31,411 --> 00:08:32,611
Agreed.

195
00:08:32,613 --> 00:08:35,113
When he gets home, I'm
dropping the hammer.

196
00:08:35,115 --> 00:08:37,115
Ooh, I like
when you take charge.

197
00:08:37,117 --> 00:08:39,351
Oh, I'm not taking charge...
You're the hammer.

198
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:48,193
So...

199
00:08:48,195 --> 00:08:50,495
why haven't we
picked a date?

200
00:08:50,497 --> 00:08:51,530
You know why.

201
00:08:51,532 --> 00:08:52,998
Well, of course I know why.

202
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,733
But just for fun... why?

203
00:08:56,168 --> 00:08:58,837
Not in a rush, busy with work...

204
00:08:58,839 --> 00:09:01,306
Things are good
right now.
Really good.

205
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:04,075
You still want
to get married, right?

206
00:09:04,077 --> 00:09:06,378
Oh, my God. Yes.
Why would you even ask that?

207
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:08,179
I don't know.
Because we don't have a date?

208
00:09:08,181 --> 00:09:10,448
Well, you want a date,
pick a date.

209
00:09:10,450 --> 00:09:11,716
It's not just the date.

210
00:09:11,718 --> 00:09:13,151
We haven't talked
about anything.

211
00:09:13,153 --> 00:09:15,020
Big wedding, small wedding,
indoor, outdoor...

212
00:09:15,022 --> 00:09:20,225
Outdoor? Oh.
I can RSVP no right now.

213
00:09:20,227 --> 00:09:22,460
Okay, indoor it is.
Big or small?

214
00:09:22,462 --> 00:09:24,195
Is your dad paying for it?
I doubt it.

215
00:09:24,197 --> 00:09:26,798
Okay, two friends each.

216
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:29,601
All right, well,
I want it in a church.

217
00:09:29,603 --> 00:09:30,936
Fine. I want black-tie.

218
00:09:30,938 --> 00:09:32,938
Fine.
I want to release butterflies.

219
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:35,307
Seriously? Airborne worms?

220
00:09:36,776 --> 00:09:38,777
Okay. Well, then it's settled:

221
00:09:38,779 --> 00:09:41,479
small indoor church wedding,
black-tie, no butterflies.

222
00:09:41,481 --> 00:09:42,747
Sounds perfect.
Great.

223
00:09:45,084 --> 00:09:46,418
You still
didn't pick a date.

224
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:48,253
Stay out of it!
Shut up!

225
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:55,961
Mmm. It's a beautiful night.

226
00:09:55,963 --> 00:09:57,829
Oh, yes, we've
got the moon

227
00:09:57,831 --> 00:09:59,598
and the trees and...

228
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,633
Elizabeth McNulty,

229
00:10:01,635 --> 00:10:04,769
who apparently died
when she was the same age I am.

230
00:10:07,373 --> 00:10:09,274
Makes you feel
alive, doesn't it?

231
00:10:09,276 --> 00:10:11,977
So does enjoying a meal
at a well-lit restaurant,

232
00:10:11,979 --> 00:10:14,479
but here we are.

233
00:10:15,915 --> 00:10:17,415
You aren't scared, are you?

234
00:10:17,417 --> 00:10:20,051
Of ghosts, no.

235
00:10:20,053 --> 00:10:22,487
Of you, little bit.

236
00:10:25,191 --> 00:10:27,325
I'm sorry I've
upset you.

237
00:10:27,327 --> 00:10:29,327
I shouldn't have asked
so many questions.

238
00:10:29,329 --> 00:10:30,562
No, it's okay.

239
00:10:30,564 --> 00:10:32,063
Yeah, maybe it's good
you got us

240
00:10:32,065 --> 00:10:33,999
talking about this stuff.

241
00:10:34,001 --> 00:10:35,667
Well, look at that...

242
00:10:35,669 --> 00:10:39,838
Even when I'm causing problems,
I make the world a better place.

243
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:43,041
Hey, next, why don't we tackle
your penchant for whining

244
00:10:43,043 --> 00:10:45,910
and Penny's love
of the ol' glug-glug?

245
00:10:49,415 --> 00:10:51,216
Uh, Sheldon, I think
we're good for now.

246
00:10:51,218 --> 00:10:52,584
Ah, well... very well.

247
00:10:52,586 --> 00:10:54,986
So does this mean you'll
finally pick a wedding date?

248
00:10:54,988 --> 00:10:56,988
(sighs)
Here we go again.

249
00:10:56,990 --> 00:10:59,758
Why is everyone so concerned
with us setting a date?

250
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,192
We're committed to
each other. We're happy.

251
00:11:01,194 --> 00:11:03,628
A ceremony isn't gonna
change anything.

252
00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:06,164
So you're never getting married?

253
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:08,867
It's his whining, isn't it?

254
00:11:08,869 --> 00:11:11,636
Sheldon, I'm not a whiner.

255
00:11:14,774 --> 00:11:17,008
It's amusing
that he doesn't hear it.

256
00:11:18,177 --> 00:11:21,312
Look, all she's saying
is we are in love

257
00:11:21,314 --> 00:11:22,781
so it doesn't matter
if we get married

258
00:11:22,783 --> 00:11:26,051
tomorrow or a year from now
or 50 years from now.

259
00:11:26,053 --> 00:11:28,753
Ew, 50?
We'll be old and gross.

260
00:11:28,755 --> 00:11:31,423
Yeah, but we'll be old
and gross together.

261
00:11:31,425 --> 00:11:32,824
SHELDON:
My aunt and uncle

262
00:11:32,826 --> 00:11:35,160
were married 63 years.

263
00:11:35,162 --> 00:11:38,129
Towards the end, it was
like watching cheese melt.

264
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:46,074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

265
00:11:49,008 --> 00:11:51,876
Um... I'm
free tonight.

266
00:11:57,616 --> 00:11:59,417
Are you saying
you want to get married?

267
00:11:59,419 --> 00:12:02,053
Vegas isn't
that far away.

268
00:12:03,022 --> 00:12:04,489
I'm in. Let's do it.

269
00:12:04,491 --> 00:12:06,091
(squeals quietly)

270
00:12:11,797 --> 00:12:13,932
After all these years.

271
00:12:15,034 --> 00:12:16,868
I'm really happy
for the two of you.

272
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:18,036
Oh, thank you.
Thanks.

273
00:12:18,038 --> 00:12:20,138
Now get out of my spot.

274
00:12:23,542 --> 00:12:26,311
Bernie, Stuart just pulled up.

275
00:12:27,113 --> 00:12:28,446
So remember,

276
00:12:28,448 --> 00:12:30,181
the key is to be firm.

277
00:12:30,183 --> 00:12:31,382
Show no weakness.

278
00:12:31,384 --> 00:12:33,885
Right.
Good luck.

279
00:12:33,887 --> 00:12:36,254
Howard Joel Wolowitz,
you get back here.

280
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:40,358
(mutters) Never should have
told you my middle name.

281
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:43,695
Hey, guys.
Hey, you got
a minute?

282
00:12:43,697 --> 00:12:46,698
Sure. Uh, let me just put
this stuff in the fridge.

283
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:48,967
I felt bad for finishing
your yogurt, so I bought more.

284
00:12:48,969 --> 00:12:51,169
And, Howard, your favorite
fruit is in season.

285
00:12:51,171 --> 00:12:52,837
Crunch Berries.

286
00:12:54,774 --> 00:12:56,741
Don't let that sway you.

287
00:12:56,743 --> 00:12:59,944
It's hard not to. They taste so
much better than real berries.

288
00:13:02,248 --> 00:13:03,548
What's up?

289
00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:06,050
So... we need to talk.

290
00:13:08,888 --> 00:13:11,122
You okay?

291
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:13,625
I think we should talk.

292
00:13:14,994 --> 00:13:16,694
Is everything okay?

293
00:13:17,763 --> 00:13:20,565
Well... you've been
living here a while now.

294
00:13:20,567 --> 00:13:22,901
I know.
I may sell comic books at work,

295
00:13:22,903 --> 00:13:24,636
but the real superheroes

296
00:13:24,638 --> 00:13:26,237
are sitting
right in front of me.

297
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:31,576
Yeah...

298
00:13:31,578 --> 00:13:34,746
His middle name is David. Go.

299
00:13:35,781 --> 00:13:38,650
Look, I care about you a lot,

300
00:13:38,652 --> 00:13:41,419
but we are very
different people.

301
00:13:41,421 --> 00:13:43,454
Are you breaking up with me?

302
00:13:44,857 --> 00:13:46,591
No, no, I'm just
pointing out that

303
00:13:46,593 --> 00:13:49,694
you're dark on the inside
and I'm dark on the outside.

304
00:13:51,263 --> 00:13:54,032
So, anyway,
what I'm trying to say is...

305
00:13:54,034 --> 00:13:55,266
(phone rings)

306
00:13:57,303 --> 00:13:58,469
You need to take that?

307
00:13:58,471 --> 00:13:59,737
It's just my dad,
probably calling

308
00:13:59,739 --> 00:14:01,906
to wish me a happy birthday.

309
00:14:03,008 --> 00:14:04,108
I'll call him back.

310
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:06,010
You were saying?

311
00:14:07,546 --> 00:14:10,849
Look, Raj, be honest with me.

312
00:14:10,851 --> 00:14:12,717
If you want to end things,
just do it.

313
00:14:12,719 --> 00:14:14,419
Don't expect me
to do it for you.

314
00:14:16,322 --> 00:14:20,124
End things? I'm trying to
tell you that I love you.

315
00:14:22,528 --> 00:14:28,266
BOTH:
? Happy birthday to you. ?

316
00:14:35,975 --> 00:14:37,942
Wow, there's
a Denny's in Vegas

317
00:14:37,944 --> 00:14:39,444
you can actually
get married in.

318
00:14:39,446 --> 00:14:41,880
(chuckles)
Doesn't sound
very romantic.

319
00:14:41,882 --> 00:14:44,249
Yeah, but we could get
heart-shaped pancakes.

320
00:14:44,251 --> 00:14:46,651
I'm sure we'll find
a decent chapel.

321
00:14:46,653 --> 00:14:48,553
Yeah.

322
00:14:48,555 --> 00:14:51,522
This is crazy!
I know!

323
00:14:51,524 --> 00:14:53,391
You think people
are gonna be mad?

324
00:14:53,393 --> 00:14:56,027
Maybe. But this isn't
about them; it's about us.

325
00:14:56,029 --> 00:14:59,163
It is.
It is about us.

326
00:14:59,165 --> 00:15:00,765
And you know what
the best part is?

327
00:15:00,767 --> 00:15:02,267
We took our time.

328
00:15:02,269 --> 00:15:05,036
I mean, we met, we were friends
for a couple years,

329
00:15:05,038 --> 00:15:08,439
then we got together,
and then we got untogether,

330
00:15:08,441 --> 00:15:10,174
then we worked out
all our problems,

331
00:15:10,176 --> 00:15:12,577
and now we know
everything about each other,

332
00:15:12,579 --> 00:15:16,581
we can just go forward with
no surprises and no regrets.

333
00:15:16,583 --> 00:15:18,650
Right.
No surprises.

334
00:15:20,052 --> 00:15:22,520
And no regrets.

335
00:15:27,526 --> 00:15:28,793
Uh,

336
00:15:28,795 --> 00:15:31,930
well, there-there's
one thing

337
00:15:31,932 --> 00:15:33,998
I feel I should tell you.

338
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,099
What?

339
00:15:35,101 --> 00:15:37,735
You know, so we
can go into this

340
00:15:37,737 --> 00:15:39,971
with no secrets
between us.

341
00:15:39,973 --> 00:15:41,039
What?

342
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:46,911
Remember, uh,
a couple years back

343
00:15:46,913 --> 00:15:49,881
when I was on that research ship
in the North Sea?

344
00:15:49,883 --> 00:15:51,482
Yeah.
Okay, well,

345
00:15:51,484 --> 00:15:53,818
there-there was a
lot of drinking

346
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:55,853
and craziness
going on...
No, you told me.

347
00:15:55,855 --> 00:15:57,488
Okay, um...

348
00:15:59,325 --> 00:16:01,793
Well, there was this girl.

349
00:16:03,195 --> 00:16:05,196
What did you do?
Nothing...

350
00:16:05,198 --> 00:16:06,731
really.

351
00:16:06,733 --> 00:16:08,399
It was just kissing.

352
00:16:08,401 --> 00:16:10,368
And then what?
And then nothing.

353
00:16:10,370 --> 00:16:12,904
I stopped it.

354
00:16:12,906 --> 00:16:16,674
But it still bothers me, and...

355
00:16:18,677 --> 00:16:20,411
I wanted you to know.

356
00:16:22,281 --> 00:16:23,881
(sighs)

357
00:16:23,883 --> 00:16:25,950
All right.

358
00:16:27,786 --> 00:16:30,154
Did you ever do anything
like this since we've been...?

359
00:16:30,156 --> 00:16:32,523
Nope, never.
Oh, that's too bad.

360
00:16:33,792 --> 00:16:36,928
You know,
can I ask you a question?
Hmm?

361
00:16:36,930 --> 00:16:38,396
Why are you
telling me this now?

362
00:16:38,398 --> 00:16:41,666
Well, like I said,
we're about to get married,

363
00:16:41,668 --> 00:16:44,235
and I-I want a clean slate.

364
00:16:44,237 --> 00:16:45,503
No secrets.

365
00:16:45,505 --> 00:16:46,871
Really?
Be-Because to me,

366
00:16:46,873 --> 00:16:48,606
it seems like
we're about to get married

367
00:16:48,608 --> 00:16:49,974
and you're trying
to sabotage it.

368
00:16:49,976 --> 00:16:52,310
W-Would you rather
I didn't tell you?

369
00:16:52,312 --> 00:16:55,146
No, I don't want there
to be secrets between us.
See, now I'm confused.

370
00:16:55,148 --> 00:16:56,614
I mean, what-what
am I supposed to do?

371
00:16:56,616 --> 00:16:59,384
Uh, keep your mouth
off other women.

372
00:16:59,386 --> 00:17:01,686
I can do that.

373
00:17:01,688 --> 00:17:03,321
Uh, uh, f-from now on,

374
00:17:03,323 --> 00:17:06,090
this mouth...
You and food, that's it.

375
00:17:06,092 --> 00:17:08,593
(sighs)

376
00:17:08,595 --> 00:17:10,661
Okay.

377
00:17:10,663 --> 00:17:12,630
Yeah?

378
00:17:14,733 --> 00:17:17,135
Look, I'm not happy
this happened,

379
00:17:17,137 --> 00:17:19,003
but I think
I can get past it.

380
00:17:19,005 --> 00:17:20,972
I mean, we weren't
engaged at the time,

381
00:17:20,974 --> 00:17:22,473
and it was just kissing.

382
00:17:22,475 --> 00:17:23,741
Right.

383
00:17:23,743 --> 00:17:26,210
Just kissing.

384
00:17:26,212 --> 00:17:28,246
It wasn't even very good.

385
00:17:28,248 --> 00:17:30,114
She was a smoker.
I'd just been seasick...

386
00:17:30,116 --> 00:17:31,436
Okay, that's enough.
Stop talking.

387
00:17:35,988 --> 00:17:38,856
So...

388
00:17:38,858 --> 00:17:41,759
we're still
getting married?

389
00:17:41,761 --> 00:17:43,327
Yes.

390
00:17:45,197 --> 00:17:46,697
Because we love each other.

391
00:17:46,699 --> 00:17:48,466
Yes.

392
00:17:48,468 --> 00:17:51,736
And it's the happiest day
of our lives.

393
00:17:51,738 --> 00:17:53,004
(short laugh)
Don't push it.

394
00:17:59,344 --> 00:18:02,013
(line ringing)

395
00:18:02,015 --> 00:18:03,147
Hello.

396
00:18:03,149 --> 00:18:04,348
SHELDON:
Hello.

397
00:18:04,350 --> 00:18:06,884
Listen, I've been
thinking a lot

398
00:18:06,886 --> 00:18:08,286
about relationships

399
00:18:08,288 --> 00:18:11,556
and how difficult they can be,
and I think...

400
00:18:11,558 --> 00:18:13,591
I've been thinking
about them, too, Sheldon.

401
00:18:15,294 --> 00:18:18,296
Being your girlfriend
is so challenging.

402
00:18:18,298 --> 00:18:19,697
Emotionally,

403
00:18:19,699 --> 00:18:21,866
physically.

404
00:18:21,868 --> 00:18:25,203
I've been incredibly patient
for years.

405
00:18:26,171 --> 00:18:27,872
Strongly disagree.

406
00:18:27,874 --> 00:18:29,640
Go on.

407
00:18:29,642 --> 00:18:33,044
Okay, well...

408
00:18:33,046 --> 00:18:37,081
this isn't easy to say,
because I love you,

409
00:18:37,083 --> 00:18:38,850
but...

410
00:18:38,852 --> 00:18:42,587
I need some time
to take a step back

411
00:18:42,589 --> 00:18:45,590
and reevaluate our situation.

412
00:18:47,259 --> 00:18:48,860
Oh.

413
00:18:48,862 --> 00:18:51,963
I hope you understand.

414
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,134
Okay.

415
00:18:57,503 --> 00:18:59,570
Bye, Sheldon.

416
00:19:17,923 --> 00:19:19,991
Well, Gollum...

417
00:19:21,927 --> 00:19:25,263
...you're an expert on rings.

418
00:19:25,265 --> 00:19:28,332
What do I do with this one?
