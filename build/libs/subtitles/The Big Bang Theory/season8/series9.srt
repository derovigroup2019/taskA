1
00:00:02,674 --> 00:00:05,908
This is an easy one.
You love this guy.

2
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:07,677
Me.

3
00:00:08,813 --> 00:00:12,215
Come on, he's an
underappreciated genius.

4
00:00:12,217 --> 00:00:14,684
Still think it's me.

5
00:00:14,686 --> 00:00:16,285
It's not you.

6
00:00:16,287 --> 00:00:18,988
Now think, there's
a car named after him.

7
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:20,223
Of course there is.

8
00:00:20,225 --> 00:00:22,325
The Mini Cooper,
'cause it's me.

9
00:00:24,562 --> 00:00:26,429
How about this:

10
00:00:26,431 --> 00:00:28,564
he's a poor man's
Sheldon Cooper.

11
00:00:28,566 --> 00:00:30,199
Oh, Tesla.

12
00:00:31,002 --> 00:00:32,068
- Hi.
- Hey! - Hello.

13
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:33,603
How'd it go?
Oh, not fun.

14
00:00:33,605 --> 00:00:36,772
The doctor shoved a camera
up into my sinuses.

15
00:00:36,774 --> 00:00:38,908
Yeah, I watched. It was like
the scary boat tunnel

16
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:41,010
in<i> Willy Wonka.</i>

17
00:00:42,313 --> 00:00:44,380
Did they figure out what's wrong?
Yeah.

18
00:00:44,382 --> 00:00:45,348
It's a deviated septum.

19
00:00:45,350 --> 00:00:46,482
The surgery
to correct it is simple.

20
00:00:46,484 --> 00:00:47,683
He's gonna do it next week.

21
00:00:47,685 --> 00:00:49,619
Why would you have surgery?

22
00:00:49,621 --> 00:00:51,320
Because I can't breathe.

23
00:00:51,322 --> 00:00:53,823
I snore, I get sinus
infections...

24
00:00:53,825 --> 00:00:56,325
Yeah, back off,
he's all mine.

25
00:00:56,327 --> 00:00:58,594
But you don't have
a life-threatening condition.

26
00:00:58,596 --> 00:01:00,496
Why would you
take the risk of surgery?

27
00:01:00,498 --> 00:01:02,298
Sheldon, it's a routine
procedure.

28
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:04,400
I've heard you complain
about his snoring.

29
00:01:04,402 --> 00:01:06,602
We... Yes, for the first
five or six years,

30
00:01:06,604 --> 00:01:08,504
but I've gotten used to it.

31
00:01:09,107 --> 00:01:10,506
It helps me sleep.

32
00:01:10,508 --> 00:01:13,176
He's like my mucus-powered
white noise machine.

33
00:01:14,412 --> 00:01:16,345
Sheldon, I'm gonna get
the surgery, it's no big deal.

34
00:01:16,347 --> 00:01:17,446
End of story.

35
00:01:17,448 --> 00:01:18,995
Very well.
I'm done talking about it.

36
00:01:18,995 --> 00:01:19,812
Thank you.

37
00:01:19,836 --> 00:01:21,451
I believe it was
your turn in the game.

38
00:01:21,452 --> 00:01:22,785
Okay.

39
00:01:24,589 --> 00:01:25,621
Let's see...

40
00:01:25,623 --> 00:01:28,391
Oh, this person is most famous

41
00:01:28,393 --> 00:01:29,559
for never having gotten

42
00:01:29,561 --> 00:01:32,495
his nose mutilated
with elective surgery

43
00:01:32,497 --> 00:01:34,997
and never living the rest
of his life in the shadows

44
00:01:34,999 --> 00:01:36,832
as a hideous, disfigured freak.

45
00:01:38,136 --> 00:01:40,436
I think you could
give a better clue.

46
00:01:40,438 --> 00:01:41,537
I don't.

47
00:01:41,539 --> 00:01:44,740
I'm not even sure if
that's a person or a typo.

48
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:49,078
? Our whole universe
was in a hot, dense state ?

49
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:52,748
? Then nearly 14 billion years
ago expansion started... Wait! ?

50
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:54,350
? The Earth began to cool ?

51
00:01:54,352 --> 00:01:56,886
? The autotrophs began to drool,
Neanderthals developed tools ?

52
00:01:56,888 --> 00:01:59,455
? We built the Wall ?
?<i> We built the pyramids</i> ?

53
00:01:59,457 --> 00:02:02,191
? Math, Science, History,
unraveling the mystery ?

54
00:02:02,193 --> 00:02:04,093
? That all started
with a big bang ?

55
00:02:04,095 --> 00:02:04,513
?<i> Bang!</i> ?

59
00:02:28,453 --> 00:02:31,654
Okay, why?

60
00:02:31,656 --> 00:02:33,756
I'm listening to you snore.

61
00:02:33,758 --> 00:02:36,959
I'm wondering how
I'll ever sleep without it.

62
00:02:36,961 --> 00:02:39,695
If it helps you sleep,

63
00:02:39,697 --> 00:02:41,631
then why are you sitting here
staring at me

64
00:02:41,633 --> 00:02:44,000
like the albino boogeyman?

65
00:02:45,470 --> 00:02:47,136
Really, Leonard-- insults?

66
00:02:47,138 --> 00:02:48,871
After I spent two hours
in your closet,

67
00:02:48,873 --> 00:02:50,306
waiting for you to fall asleep?

68
00:02:53,445 --> 00:02:54,710
What's your problem?

69
00:02:54,712 --> 00:02:58,781
If the surgery is successful,
the snoring is gone.

70
00:02:58,783 --> 00:03:01,317
And if you die during surgery...

71
00:03:02,053 --> 00:03:04,687
...the snoring is gone.

72
00:03:05,757 --> 00:03:09,092
It sounds like either way,
I finally get some rest.

73
00:03:09,094 --> 00:03:11,027
I have to be honest
with you Leonard,

74
00:03:11,029 --> 00:03:12,695
I'm truly worried.

75
00:03:12,697 --> 00:03:15,598
I-I told you, there's
nothing to worry about.

76
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:17,166
Well, I've been
doing some research

77
00:03:17,168 --> 00:03:19,702
and I've learned that
one in 700,000 people

78
00:03:19,704 --> 00:03:22,004
die from general anesthesia.

79
00:03:22,006 --> 00:03:24,707
Buddy, w... Do you realize that
that also means

80
00:03:24,709 --> 00:03:28,678
699,999 people don't die?

81
00:03:30,849 --> 00:03:32,415
I suppose that's true.

82
00:03:34,219 --> 00:03:36,619
You're such a glass
half-full kind of guy.

83
00:03:38,423 --> 00:03:40,990
I'm going to miss that.

84
00:03:43,328 --> 00:03:46,829
Oh, so, my, uh, parents'
40th anniversary's coming up

85
00:03:46,831 --> 00:03:49,031
and I can't think
of a thing to get them.

86
00:03:49,033 --> 00:03:50,466
Damn, can you imagine

87
00:03:50,468 --> 00:03:54,237
being married to someone
for 40 years?

88
00:03:57,008 --> 00:03:59,041
Not anymore.

89
00:04:03,181 --> 00:04:05,548
Anyway, any ideas on a gift?

90
00:04:05,550 --> 00:04:07,683
Well, what are some
of the things they like?

91
00:04:07,685 --> 00:04:10,086
They used to like
going to the Mumbai Symphony,

92
00:04:10,088 --> 00:04:12,388
but last year my mom thought
they were phoning it in.

93
00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:13,623
Then my dad said
based on their

94
00:04:13,625 --> 00:04:16,859
love life, she should know
about phoning it in.

95
00:04:17,807 --> 00:04:18,796
He said that to her?

96
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:20,364
Well, they weren't
speaking at the time,

97
00:04:20,365 --> 00:04:22,198
so he had a servant
say it to her.

98
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:25,334
Oh, maybe I could
make a gift for them.

99
00:04:25,336 --> 00:04:28,738
I know how much you guys love
the coasters I made for you.

100
00:04:31,109 --> 00:04:33,709
They're yours in the divorce.

101
00:04:38,049 --> 00:04:39,815
Hey. What're you working on?

102
00:04:39,817 --> 00:04:41,717
Remember when I said
if you went through

103
00:04:41,719 --> 00:04:45,321
with your surgery, there was a
one-in-700,000 chance of dying?

104
00:04:45,323 --> 00:04:47,523
Yeah...?

105
00:04:47,525 --> 00:04:49,225
Well, I've been
crunching the numbers,

106
00:04:49,227 --> 00:04:52,562
and so far, I've gotten
your probability of death

107
00:04:52,564 --> 00:04:54,230
all the way to a
sphincter-tightening

108
00:04:54,232 --> 00:04:56,799
one in 300.

109
00:04:58,336 --> 00:04:59,702
Great timing.

110
00:04:59,704 --> 00:05:02,572
My “check sphincter”
light just went on.

111
00:05:02,574 --> 00:05:05,374
Leonard, what if you have
an allergic reaction

112
00:05:05,376 --> 00:05:07,743
to the surgeon's latex gloves?
I'm not

113
00:05:07,745 --> 00:05:09,011
allergic to latex.

114
00:05:09,013 --> 00:05:10,646
Well, then why don't you
wear the rubber gloves

115
00:05:10,648 --> 00:05:12,281
I bought for you
to do the dishes?

116
00:05:12,283 --> 00:05:15,785
For the same reason I don't
wear the apron or the hair net.

117
00:05:15,787 --> 00:05:18,721
Fine. What about epilepsy?

118
00:05:18,723 --> 00:05:20,489
I don't have epilepsy, either.

119
00:05:20,491 --> 00:05:22,925
You don't,
but the surgeon might, hmm?

120
00:05:22,927 --> 00:05:26,429
And your carotid artery is just
one shaky scalpel away

121
00:05:26,431 --> 00:05:29,966
from becoming the dancing
fountain at Disneyland.

122
00:05:29,968 --> 00:05:33,336
Sheldon, do you realize that
driving is riskier than surgery?

123
00:05:33,338 --> 00:05:36,572
I do. I have the drive
to the hospital right here.

124
00:05:36,574 --> 00:05:37,907
That is if
you make it

125
00:05:37,909 --> 00:05:40,743
to the car without
falling down the stairs.

126
00:05:40,745 --> 00:05:43,779
And don't expect me to carry
you, I do that enough in life.

127
00:05:44,882 --> 00:05:46,716
Buddy, I-I get that
you're worried about me

128
00:05:46,718 --> 00:05:49,619
and I-I appreciate that,
but I'm not going to die.

129
00:05:49,621 --> 00:05:51,254
You don't know that.
Well...

130
00:05:51,256 --> 00:05:54,757
I do know that it won't
be from an asteroid strike.

131
00:05:55,994 --> 00:05:57,560
You know who else said that?

132
00:05:57,562 --> 00:05:59,562
Every cocky T. Rex
currently swimming around

133
00:05:59,564 --> 00:06:01,631
in the gas tank of your car.

134
00:06:02,467 --> 00:06:04,267
I-If there was
an asteroid strike,

135
00:06:04,269 --> 00:06:05,468
wouldn't you die, too?

136
00:06:05,470 --> 00:06:07,203
I don't know--
I'm smart and scrappy,

137
00:06:07,205 --> 00:06:09,538
I think I'd find a way.

138
00:06:11,242 --> 00:06:13,342
Tell you what--
the surgery's not for a week,

139
00:06:13,344 --> 00:06:14,577
I'll think about it.

140
00:06:14,579 --> 00:06:17,380
Thank you. And while
you're thinking about it,

141
00:06:17,382 --> 00:06:19,482
if you have the surgery
in Nicaragua during

142
00:06:19,484 --> 00:06:21,083
monsoon season,
I can practically

143
00:06:21,085 --> 00:06:22,485
guarantee your death.

144
00:06:27,458 --> 00:06:30,459
Yes. Okay.

145
00:06:30,461 --> 00:06:32,094
I-I understand.

146
00:06:32,096 --> 00:06:33,429
Of course, yes.

147
00:06:33,431 --> 00:06:35,464
I'll call you tomorrow.

148
00:06:35,466 --> 00:06:37,266
Bye.

149
00:06:37,268 --> 00:06:40,503
So I found this fencing school
in Burbank

150
00:06:40,505 --> 00:06:42,905
that has a Jedi class.

151
00:06:44,842 --> 00:06:46,609
And if you're cool
being the only adults there,

152
00:06:46,611 --> 00:06:48,878
they said they are.

153
00:06:49,814 --> 00:06:51,480
Dude, my parents just split up.

154
00:06:51,482 --> 00:06:54,350
What?!
Uh, that was my dad on the phone.

155
00:06:54,352 --> 00:06:56,285
He moved out.

156
00:06:56,287 --> 00:06:59,188
Oh, my God, I... I'm sorry.

157
00:06:59,190 --> 00:07:02,091
I mean, if you're not up to it,
we don't have to go out,

158
00:07:02,093 --> 00:07:04,060
we can just hang here.
No,

159
00:07:04,062 --> 00:07:06,228
it's fine.
It's not that big a deal.

160
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:08,531
As long as they're happy,
I'm happy.

161
00:07:08,533 --> 00:07:10,766
And when I get to see them
for the holidays,

162
00:07:10,768 --> 00:07:12,835
I'll get to celebrate
Diwali twice--

163
00:07:12,837 --> 00:07:14,437
one at each house.

164
00:07:16,774 --> 00:07:18,941
That's double the Diwali.

165
00:07:19,877 --> 00:07:21,177
You sure you're okay?

166
00:07:21,179 --> 00:07:22,278
I'm okay.

167
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:23,512
You don't look okay.

168
00:07:23,514 --> 00:07:26,015
How can I be okay?
I come from a broken home.

169
00:07:28,653 --> 00:07:31,087
The doctor said I should be
out of surgery by 10:00.

170
00:07:31,089 --> 00:07:32,555
Okay.

171
00:07:32,557 --> 00:07:36,325
And Sheldon really believes
we're at a public swimming pool?

172
00:07:37,462 --> 00:07:40,696
He was so busy figuring out
how many parts per million

173
00:07:40,698 --> 00:07:43,499
of urine we'd be floating around
in, he didn't even question it.

174
00:07:44,769 --> 00:07:48,070
18 parts per million.

175
00:07:49,307 --> 00:07:51,407
And he's still doing it.

176
00:07:51,409 --> 00:07:54,110
Don't worry about that.
I'm happy to take you to work.

177
00:07:54,112 --> 00:07:55,544
Well, thank you.

178
00:07:55,546 --> 00:07:58,981
And Leonard never lets me have
French toast sticks in the car.

179
00:07:58,983 --> 00:08:01,083
I can't have syrupy fingers,

180
00:08:01,085 --> 00:08:04,053
but he can do the backstroke
in a toilet bowl.

181
00:08:05,356 --> 00:08:07,790
It's nice they're
getting exercise.

182
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:11,060
Although now that
I think about it,

183
00:08:11,062 --> 00:08:13,229
Leonard would never
go swimming in public

184
00:08:13,231 --> 00:08:15,831
without his swim shirt.

185
00:08:16,868 --> 00:08:18,000
I'm sure he brought it.

186
00:08:18,002 --> 00:08:20,069
No, but last year,
at Magic Mountain,

187
00:08:20,071 --> 00:08:21,737
he got such a bad sunburn,

188
00:08:21,739 --> 00:08:24,507
we had to cut him out of it.

189
00:08:25,710 --> 00:08:27,743
He probably got a new one.
Finish your breakfast.

190
00:08:27,745 --> 00:08:29,645
Look, there's an entire
section of my dashboard

191
00:08:29,647 --> 00:08:31,447
that doesn't have
any syrup on it.

192
00:08:32,316 --> 00:08:35,251
You're acting odd. Why?

193
00:08:35,253 --> 00:08:38,387
I'm odd all the time,
everyone knows that.

194
00:08:38,389 --> 00:08:39,855
Just last night,

195
00:08:39,857 --> 00:08:42,992
I tried to see how many fava
beans I could fit in my mouth.

196
00:08:44,462 --> 00:08:45,661
Tell me the truth.

197
00:08:45,663 --> 00:08:48,264
28.
Come on.

198
00:08:48,266 --> 00:08:51,000
Fifty-six.

199
00:08:51,002 --> 00:08:52,234
Amy!

200
00:08:52,236 --> 00:08:54,703
What's going on?

201
00:08:54,705 --> 00:08:56,639
All right.

202
00:08:56,641 --> 00:08:57,807
Don't get upset, but...

203
00:08:57,809 --> 00:09:01,110
an earlier appointment
opened up for Leonard

204
00:09:01,112 --> 00:09:04,780
and he's getting
the surgery right now.

205
00:09:08,419 --> 00:09:10,619
I see.

206
00:09:15,693 --> 00:09:17,126
Take me to Leonard.

207
00:09:17,128 --> 00:09:19,228
Just go to work,
he'll be fine.

208
00:09:19,230 --> 00:09:22,064
Amy, he's my best friend,
and if you don't take me,

209
00:09:22,066 --> 00:09:23,632
I'm going there anyway.

210
00:09:23,634 --> 00:09:26,735
Fine.

211
00:09:26,737 --> 00:09:29,338
It's sweet that you
care about him so much.

212
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:30,573
I do.

213
00:09:30,575 --> 00:09:32,241
And I wouldn't
be able to forgive myself,

214
00:09:32,243 --> 00:09:34,543
if something happened to him
and I wasn't at his bedside

215
00:09:34,545 --> 00:09:36,812
to say, “I told you so.”

216
00:09:53,504 --> 00:09:54,770
Hello.

217
00:09:54,772 --> 00:09:56,538
We had a really nice swim.

218
00:09:56,540 --> 00:09:57,806
Oh, stop it.

219
00:09:57,808 --> 00:10:01,243
I assume this medical
center's already treated

220
00:10:01,245 --> 00:10:04,279
the burns on your bottom
from the recent pants fire.

221
00:10:05,516 --> 00:10:07,716
'Cause I'm a liar, liar?

222
00:10:07,718 --> 00:10:09,818
That's for the fire marshal
to determine.

223
00:10:11,822 --> 00:10:12,854
You had to tell him?

224
00:10:12,856 --> 00:10:14,389
He wore me down.

225
00:10:14,391 --> 00:10:15,724
And I was distracted.

226
00:10:15,726 --> 00:10:18,727
He has on
extra baby powder today.

227
00:10:18,729 --> 00:10:20,195
Is he okay?

228
00:10:20,197 --> 00:10:22,197
He's still in surgery.

229
00:10:23,534 --> 00:10:25,400
Very well.

230
00:10:25,402 --> 00:10:27,836
He's gonna be all right.

231
00:10:27,838 --> 00:10:30,005
That is sticky.

232
00:10:31,842 --> 00:10:33,508
Come on,
let's talk about something

233
00:10:33,510 --> 00:10:34,676
other than the surgery.

234
00:10:34,678 --> 00:10:36,278
That's a good idea.

235
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:40,649
Penny, did you and Leonard ever
discuss funeral arrangements?

236
00:10:41,885 --> 00:10:44,620
I think she meant
something a little happier.

237
00:10:44,622 --> 00:10:49,057
I suppose we could try
to make it a celebration,

238
00:10:49,059 --> 00:10:51,393
but he died so young.

239
00:10:55,132 --> 00:10:56,732
Knock, knock.
Hi.

240
00:10:56,734 --> 00:10:57,733
Hey.
What brings you by?

241
00:10:57,735 --> 00:10:59,401
Oh...

242
00:10:59,403 --> 00:11:02,237
muffin much.

243
00:11:03,073 --> 00:11:05,173
Told you-- not funny.

244
00:11:05,175 --> 00:11:07,175
He's just not laughing

245
00:11:07,177 --> 00:11:11,747
because he's feeling...
<i>blue</i> berry.

246
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:16,318
Tough crowd.

247
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,853
I'm sorry.

248
00:11:17,855 --> 00:11:19,588
This is very sweet. Thanks.

249
00:11:19,590 --> 00:11:20,722
So, how you doing?

250
00:11:20,724 --> 00:11:21,957
Better. I guess

251
00:11:21,959 --> 00:11:24,292
the news just hit me
a lot harder than I expected.

252
00:11:24,294 --> 00:11:25,661
Well, of course.

253
00:11:25,663 --> 00:11:28,096
I would be devastated
if my parents split up.

254
00:11:28,098 --> 00:11:31,533
Why? Your father barely
speaks to your mother.

255
00:11:31,535 --> 00:11:32,968
Well, at least
he stuck around,

256
00:11:32,970 --> 00:11:34,803
not like your dad,
who just took off.

257
00:11:34,805 --> 00:11:38,106
As you can see, we're
here to cheer you up.

258
00:11:39,176 --> 00:11:40,809
Sorry, Raj.

259
00:11:40,811 --> 00:11:42,511
Do you have any sense of
what happened with your folks?

260
00:11:42,513 --> 00:11:46,481
I think, over time, they started
to resent each other,

261
00:11:46,483 --> 00:11:47,983
and instead of talking
about the things

262
00:11:47,985 --> 00:11:49,951
that bothered them,
they kept it bottled up,

263
00:11:49,953 --> 00:11:51,953
and the hate just grew.

264
00:11:51,955 --> 00:11:54,790
It's a shame they spent
all that time unhappy.

265
00:11:54,792 --> 00:11:56,692
But sometimes,

266
00:11:56,694 --> 00:11:59,327
there's<i> muffin</i>
you can do about it.

267
00:12:01,131 --> 00:12:03,498
You get it, right?

268
00:12:07,237 --> 00:12:09,438
Oh, it's nice
you got him that.

269
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:11,206
Oh, this isn't
for Leonard, no.

270
00:12:11,208 --> 00:12:13,809
Amy bought it for me.

271
00:12:15,379 --> 00:12:18,947
Stubbed his toe on the
revolving door on the way in.

272
00:12:18,949 --> 00:12:21,717
You know those confounded
things make me dizzy.

273
00:12:21,719 --> 00:12:24,886
Who told you
to keep going around?

274
00:12:24,888 --> 00:12:26,855
There was a large
plant in the lobby.

275
00:12:26,857 --> 00:12:28,824
It kept looking
like the outside.

276
00:12:29,827 --> 00:12:31,493
Okay, listen,
when Leonard comes out,

277
00:12:31,495 --> 00:12:33,061
he is not gonna feel great,

278
00:12:33,063 --> 00:12:35,230
so, please don't
give him a hard time.

279
00:12:35,232 --> 00:12:36,431
Penny has a good point.

280
00:12:36,433 --> 00:12:38,467
This is like the man
in the supermarket

281
00:12:38,469 --> 00:12:40,135
with the goiter on his neck.

282
00:12:40,137 --> 00:12:43,038
Whatever you're thinking,
just keep it to yourself.

283
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:46,508
It was like a grapefruit.

284
00:12:46,510 --> 00:12:48,343
And I'm sure he knew that

285
00:12:48,345 --> 00:12:51,346
before you held
a grapefruit up next to it.

286
00:12:51,348 --> 00:12:53,115
Well, I'm not
making any promises.

287
00:12:53,117 --> 00:12:56,084
Not only did Leonard take what
I feel is an unnecessary risk,

288
00:12:56,086 --> 00:12:57,319
he deceived me.

289
00:12:57,321 --> 00:12:58,820
Okay, the reason
he deceived you is

290
00:12:58,822 --> 00:13:00,489
you were being
a pain in the ass.

291
00:13:00,491 --> 00:13:02,724
The reason I was being
a pain in the B is

292
00:13:02,726 --> 00:13:04,960
because I was worried about
him, and no one else was.

293
00:13:04,962 --> 00:13:06,728
Really? You won't
even say “A”?

294
00:13:06,730 --> 00:13:08,730
You bet your
sweet B I won't.

295
00:13:08,732 --> 00:13:10,499
Obviously, I care
about Leonard.

296
00:13:10,501 --> 00:13:13,034
I'm gonna spend the rest
of my life with him.

297
00:13:13,036 --> 00:13:14,736
And I'm not?

298
00:13:17,574 --> 00:13:19,040
It's an earthquake.

299
00:13:19,042 --> 00:13:20,275
I knew it.

300
00:13:20,277 --> 00:13:21,977
Sheldon, it was
just a little tremor.

301
00:13:21,979 --> 00:13:24,880
A little tremor that turns
routine sinus surgery

302
00:13:24,882 --> 00:13:27,816
into a frontal
lobotomy.

303
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:32,721
Oh, I don't care
for this at all.

304
00:13:32,723 --> 00:13:35,423
Oh, I need to
see he's okay.

305
00:13:35,425 --> 00:13:37,225
Sheldon, you can't
go back there.

306
00:13:37,227 --> 00:13:39,027
Try and stop me!

307
00:13:41,098 --> 00:13:42,964
Are you okay?

308
00:13:42,966 --> 00:13:45,100
Why didn't you stop me?!

309
00:13:47,638 --> 00:13:49,471
Can I tell you
something?

310
00:13:49,473 --> 00:13:51,807
This whole thing
with Raj's parents

311
00:13:51,809 --> 00:13:54,342
just got me
a little worried about us.

312
00:13:54,344 --> 00:13:56,945
What are you talking about?
We're fine.

313
00:13:56,947 --> 00:13:57,979
And Raj's parents

314
00:13:57,981 --> 00:14:00,949
probably split up
because of Raj.

315
00:14:00,951 --> 00:14:02,617
What?!

316
00:14:02,619 --> 00:14:05,320
They always say the children
aren't to blame, but...

317
00:14:05,322 --> 00:14:08,223
Come on.

318
00:14:10,661 --> 00:14:12,627
I'm not joking, Howie.

319
00:14:12,629 --> 00:14:14,262
You heard what he said
about his parents.

320
00:14:14,264 --> 00:14:16,464
It was the little things
they kept bottled up.

321
00:14:16,466 --> 00:14:18,934
I don't want that
to happen to us.

322
00:14:18,936 --> 00:14:21,069
How can I convince you it won't?

323
00:14:21,071 --> 00:14:24,673
Well, is there anything about me
you're keeping inside?

324
00:14:24,675 --> 00:14:26,575
I'm not answering that.

325
00:14:26,577 --> 00:14:29,644
It's a trap.

326
00:14:31,014 --> 00:14:33,114
So there<i> are</i> things
you don't like.

327
00:14:33,116 --> 00:14:36,117
And here I am in the trap.

328
00:14:37,621 --> 00:14:39,521
You just keep talking.

329
00:14:39,523 --> 00:14:42,023
I'm gonna chew my leg off.

330
00:14:42,025 --> 00:14:44,226
Just tell me one thing
that bothers you,

331
00:14:44,228 --> 00:14:45,794
and I promise I won't get mad.

332
00:14:45,796 --> 00:14:48,964
Okay. The truth is...

333
00:14:48,966 --> 00:14:51,099
sometimes... you're too...

334
00:14:51,101 --> 00:14:53,101
beautiful.

335
00:14:53,103 --> 00:14:54,703
Oh.

336
00:14:54,705 --> 00:14:57,138
Howie, be serious.

337
00:14:57,140 --> 00:14:59,107
Okay, okay.

338
00:14:59,109 --> 00:15:01,376
I really don't like

339
00:15:01,378 --> 00:15:03,612
how your wings poke me
when we sleep

340
00:15:03,614 --> 00:15:06,448
'cause you're an angel.

341
00:15:07,985 --> 00:15:10,118
Okay, fine,
maybe it was a bad idea.

342
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:12,854
I just don't think the secret
to a happy marriage

343
00:15:12,856 --> 00:15:15,390
is going out of our way
to criticize each other.

344
00:15:15,392 --> 00:15:18,693
Although, there are ways
to improve our communication.

345
00:15:18,695 --> 00:15:21,630
One thing I learned when
I was in couples therapy was...

346
00:15:21,632 --> 00:15:22,864
Who were you

347
00:15:22,866 --> 00:15:24,032
in couples therapy with?

348
00:15:24,034 --> 00:15:26,201
Not important.

349
00:15:26,203 --> 00:15:28,436
Was it your mom?

350
00:15:28,438 --> 00:15:30,038
Not important.

351
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:32,574
It was your mom.

352
00:15:32,576 --> 00:15:35,810
Anyway, the therapist had us
tell each other

353
00:15:35,812 --> 00:15:38,480
what we loved about one another.

354
00:15:38,482 --> 00:15:40,215
Oh, that's so sweet!

355
00:15:40,217 --> 00:15:41,883
I want to do that.

356
00:15:41,885 --> 00:15:43,218
All right.

357
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:45,153
Okay, um...

358
00:15:45,155 --> 00:15:48,156
I love that you make me laugh.

359
00:15:48,158 --> 00:15:49,891
Thank you.

360
00:15:49,893 --> 00:15:54,729
And I love that you're strong
and independent.

361
00:15:54,731 --> 00:15:57,799
And yet, I still love
when you hold a door for me.

362
00:15:57,801 --> 00:16:01,703
I love that I'm kind of a slob
around here, and...

363
00:16:01,705 --> 00:16:03,939
you're okay with that.

364
00:16:06,743 --> 00:16:08,944
Uh-huh.

365
00:16:10,213 --> 00:16:13,148
And I love that I work
and do all the cleaning,

366
00:16:13,150 --> 00:16:15,517
and you're okay with that.

367
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:17,986
See, I am.

368
00:16:17,988 --> 00:16:20,055
Isn't this great?

369
00:16:23,093 --> 00:16:24,426
Come on, smile.

370
00:16:24,428 --> 00:16:26,394
This is gonna be
my Christmas card.

371
00:16:31,301 --> 00:16:34,669
You know this is
all your fault.

372
00:16:34,671 --> 00:16:38,173
How is it my fault?

373
00:16:38,175 --> 00:16:40,108
I told you not to
get the surgery.

374
00:16:40,110 --> 00:16:43,545
Okay, first of all,
the surgery was a success,

375
00:16:43,547 --> 00:16:45,981
and secondly,
I didn't even want you there.

376
00:16:45,983 --> 00:16:49,684
Wow. I don't know
which hurts worse--

377
00:16:49,686 --> 00:16:51,853
my nose or my heart.

378
00:16:52,990 --> 00:16:54,356
Well, I'm done
speaking to you.

379
00:16:54,358 --> 00:16:55,490
Don't be like that.

380
00:16:55,492 --> 00:16:57,492
You two need to
talk this out.

381
00:16:57,494 --> 00:16:59,828
Yeah, 'cause
you sound really funny.

382
00:17:02,232 --> 00:17:04,899
Sheldon, I'm sorry I didn't
tell you about the surgery,

383
00:17:04,901 --> 00:17:06,935
but you were worried
about nothing.

384
00:17:06,937 --> 00:17:09,170
Oh, you're hardly
out of the woods, no.

385
00:17:09,172 --> 00:17:12,007
You still run the risk of
infection, a blood clot,

386
00:17:12,009 --> 00:17:14,376
the possibility that
an inattentive surgeon

387
00:17:14,378 --> 00:17:17,312
let a barn spider
lay eggs in your nose.

388
00:17:19,182 --> 00:17:21,950
The minute you sneeze web,
I'm moving out.

389
00:17:21,952 --> 00:17:24,452
I never thought
I'd say these words,

390
00:17:24,454 --> 00:17:26,654
but come on, nose spider!

391
00:17:28,358 --> 00:17:29,290
Who are you kidding?

392
00:17:29,292 --> 00:17:30,492
You were so panicked

393
00:17:30,494 --> 00:17:32,227
Leonard was gonna die,
you'll never leave him.

394
00:17:32,229 --> 00:17:34,262
Sheldon will move out
eventually.

395
00:17:34,264 --> 00:17:36,731
Yeah, once he figures out
how to work a door.

396
00:17:37,934 --> 00:17:41,770
I was not panicked, and I am
not overly attached to Leonard.

397
00:17:41,772 --> 00:17:43,938
You were so worried
that you smashed your face

398
00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:45,106
trying to check on me.

399
00:17:45,108 --> 00:17:46,574
You<i> love</i> me.

400
00:17:47,778 --> 00:17:49,077
Yeah. Tell me

401
00:17:49,079 --> 00:17:50,578
those aren't the
words of a man

402
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:52,614
with a spider eating its
way through his brain.

403
00:17:52,616 --> 00:17:55,417
Amy, you're a neuroscientist.

404
00:17:55,419 --> 00:17:58,086
Crack his skull open,
spray some Raid in there.

405
00:18:00,757 --> 00:18:03,024
I love that you take pride
in your looks,

406
00:18:03,026 --> 00:18:04,025
even when I have

407
00:18:04,027 --> 00:18:05,326
to pee in the morning,

408
00:18:05,328 --> 00:18:08,129
and you're in there
spending an hour on your hair.

409
00:18:08,131 --> 00:18:12,567
I love that you're too good
to pee in the kitchen sink.

410
00:18:12,569 --> 00:18:15,170
I love
that you have the confidence

411
00:18:15,172 --> 00:18:19,207
to speak, even without giving it
an ounce of thought.

412
00:18:20,177 --> 00:18:22,811
And I love how your hair
is always on the soap.

413
00:18:22,813 --> 00:18:25,380
It's like washing myself
with a hamster.

414
00:18:26,917 --> 00:18:29,918
Hey, guys.
Sorry I am so late.

415
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:32,954
I was on the phone
with my mother.

416
00:18:32,956 --> 00:18:33,988
Oh, how is she?

417
00:18:33,990 --> 00:18:35,123
Pretty good.

418
00:18:35,125 --> 00:18:37,158
She bought the book
<i>Eat, Pray, Love</i>

419
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:40,495
and used it to set my father's
Mercedes on fire.

420
00:18:42,165 --> 00:18:45,600
So, what's up with you guys?

421
00:18:45,602 --> 00:18:48,470
We're just saying all the things
we love about each other.

422
00:18:48,472 --> 00:18:51,406
Oh, like you and I
did at couples therapy.

423
00:19:04,016 --> 00:19:05,215
Ooh, what'd you get?

424
00:19:05,217 --> 00:19:07,450
Oh, I ordered it
before your surgery.

425
00:19:07,452 --> 00:19:11,087
It's the urn I was going
to put you in.

426
00:19:12,124 --> 00:19:13,423
Okay, that's morbid.

427
00:19:13,425 --> 00:19:14,691
Send it back.

428
00:19:14,693 --> 00:19:19,162
I can't send it back--
I had it engraved.

429
00:19:19,164 --> 00:19:22,766
“Here lie the ashes
of Leonard Hofstadter.

430
00:19:22,768 --> 00:19:27,203
He thought he was right,
but his roommate knew better."

431
00:19:28,973 --> 00:19:30,507
That's funny.

432
00:19:30,509 --> 00:19:32,509
Boy, I'm gonna miss
these painkillers.

433
00:19:33,911 --> 00:19:35,812
Hey, why did you get two?

434
00:19:35,814 --> 00:19:38,815
"I'm with stupid."
Oh, that one's mine.
