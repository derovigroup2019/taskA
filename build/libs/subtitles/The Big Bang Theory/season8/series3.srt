1
00:00:03,126 --> 00:00:04,619
So, how does this game work?

2
00:00:04,619 --> 00:00:06,252
I just throw it,
like a real ball?

3
00:00:06,254 --> 00:00:08,771
Yeah, just nice and easy,
right over the plate.

4
00:00:08,773 --> 00:00:10,673
All right.

5
00:00:10,675 --> 00:00:13,159
You suck, Wolowitz!

6
00:00:13,161 --> 00:00:15,028
What's that about?

7
00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:16,196
I'm heckling you.

8
00:00:16,198 --> 00:00:17,747
It's a beloved part
of baseball.

9
00:00:17,749 --> 00:00:19,532
He's right.

10
00:00:19,534 --> 00:00:20,950
And given that you're
probably still waiting

11
00:00:20,952 --> 00:00:22,902
to be picked for a game that
was played in fifth grade,

12
00:00:22,904 --> 00:00:24,988
I'm sure you do suck.

13
00:00:26,041 --> 00:00:27,490
Hi. What's going on?

14
00:00:27,492 --> 00:00:28,575
Baseball.

15
00:00:28,577 --> 00:00:30,577
Okay, this is not
what I meant when I said

16
00:00:30,579 --> 00:00:31,861
go outside and play.

17
00:00:31,863 --> 00:00:33,746
He's practicing.

18
00:00:33,748 --> 00:00:34,714
For what?

19
00:00:34,716 --> 00:00:37,083
The Angels wanted an astronaut

20
00:00:37,085 --> 00:00:38,635
to throw out the first pitch,

21
00:00:38,637 --> 00:00:40,420
so guess who they called?

22
00:00:40,422 --> 00:00:41,955
What, you? Really?!

23
00:00:41,957 --> 00:00:45,425
Well, a lot of people who
weren't available, but then me!

24
00:00:46,661 --> 00:00:47,677
That's so cool!

25
00:00:47,679 --> 00:00:48,845
Congratulations.

26
00:00:48,847 --> 00:00:50,980
I guess that makes you
the athlete of the group.

27
00:00:50,982 --> 00:00:52,932
Well, not just him!

28
00:00:52,934 --> 00:00:55,568
May I remind you that you're
talking to the seeker, beater,

29
00:00:55,570 --> 00:00:57,604
chaser and water boy

30
00:00:57,606 --> 00:01:00,773
of the third place
Griffith Park Quidditch team.

31
00:01:00,775 --> 00:01:01,941
I know.

32
00:01:01,943 --> 00:01:03,610
Watching your boyfriend
run around with a broomstick

33
00:01:03,612 --> 00:01:06,062
between his legs
isn't something you forget.

34
00:01:07,198 --> 00:01:08,331
C'mon now,
throw one.

35
00:01:08,333 --> 00:01:10,700
All right,
here we go.

36
00:01:10,702 --> 00:01:12,952
You look like a jackass!

37
00:01:12,954 --> 00:01:15,004
Cut it out!
You're hurting my feelings!

38
00:01:15,006 --> 00:01:17,874
Now you know why
we're not outside.

39
00:01:17,876 --> 00:01:21,511
? Our whole universe
was in a hot, dense state ?

40
00:01:21,513 --> 00:01:24,847
? Then nearly 14 billion years
ago expansion started... Wait! ?

41
00:01:24,849 --> 00:01:26,466
? The Earth began to cool ?

42
00:01:26,468 --> 00:01:29,018
? The autotrophs began to drool,
Neanderthals developed tools ?

43
00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:31,688
? We built the Wall ?
?<i> We built the pyramids</i> ?

44
00:01:31,690 --> 00:01:34,357
? Math, Science, History,
unraveling the mystery ?

45
00:01:34,359 --> 00:01:36,276
? That all started
with a big bang ?

46
00:01:36,278 --> 00:01:36,999
?<i> Bang!</i> ?

47

49
00:01:47,502 --> 00:01:49,567
Did you enjoy
my lecture?

50
00:01:49,568 --> 00:01:51,985
No, and neither did
our waiter.

51
00:01:53,656 --> 00:01:56,156
Well, if you're going to
serve Cornish game hen,

52
00:01:56,158 --> 00:01:58,742
you should either be familiar
with the history of Cornwall

53
00:01:58,744 --> 00:02:00,194
or be prepared
to learn it.

54
00:02:01,664 --> 00:02:02,946
It's hard to argue with that.

55
00:02:02,948 --> 00:02:05,749
And I know because I saw a
sad man with a pepper mill

56
00:02:05,751 --> 00:02:07,868
desperately try and fail.

57
00:02:12,875 --> 00:02:14,007
Hey, how was dinner?

58
00:02:14,009 --> 00:02:16,426
Good, I had Cornish game hen.

59
00:02:16,428 --> 00:02:19,012
Oh, that poor waiter.

60
00:02:20,633 --> 00:02:22,800
Sheldon, how about tomorrow
night we see a movie?

61
00:02:22,802 --> 00:02:24,635
You guys are going out
two nights in a row?

62
00:02:24,637 --> 00:02:28,605
I missed a number of date nights
while I was on my train trip,

63
00:02:28,607 --> 00:02:30,808
and I'm contractually
obligated to make them up

64
00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:33,277
under the terms of the
Relationship Agreement.

65
00:02:34,146 --> 00:02:36,346
That's so hot.

66
00:02:36,348 --> 00:02:39,566
It's better than hot,
it's binding.

67
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:43,287
If you're free
tomorrow night,

68
00:02:43,289 --> 00:02:45,572
I'd love to have you
join us on a double date.

69
00:02:45,574 --> 00:02:46,974
Aw...

70
00:02:46,976 --> 00:02:51,128
You are aware that a double date
doesn't count as two dates.

71
00:02:52,331 --> 00:02:54,131
Oh.

72
00:02:54,133 --> 00:02:55,382
Well, then come
or don't.

73
00:02:55,384 --> 00:02:56,583
I don't care.

74
00:03:00,389 --> 00:03:03,257
I can't believe you're sore.

75
00:03:03,259 --> 00:03:06,643
Hey, even professional pitchers
need a rubdown after the game.

76
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:09,897
But they throw
an actual ball.

77
00:03:09,899 --> 00:03:12,816
You were throwing
air at a TV.

78
00:03:14,270 --> 00:03:15,485
For your information,

79
00:03:15,487 --> 00:03:18,655
I also gave Leonard
one hell of a high five.

80
00:03:18,657 --> 00:03:20,858
I'm kind of surprised
you agreed to do this

81
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:22,743
in front of a stadium
full of people.

82
00:03:22,745 --> 00:03:25,245
They're doing Space Day
and NASA asked me.

83
00:03:25,247 --> 00:03:26,697
I felt like I couldn't say no.

84
00:03:26,699 --> 00:03:27,865
Okay.

85
00:03:27,867 --> 00:03:29,700
Well, if you want,
I could help you practice.

86
00:03:29,702 --> 00:03:31,368
I played a lot of softball
growing up.

87
00:03:31,370 --> 00:03:33,670
Thank you, that
would be great.

88
00:03:33,672 --> 00:03:34,955
Great.
And while we're at it,

89
00:03:34,957 --> 00:03:36,206
maybe we could butch up your run

90
00:03:36,208 --> 00:03:37,791
for when you head out
to the mound.

91
00:03:39,178 --> 00:03:41,094
What's wrong with the way I run?

92
00:03:41,096 --> 00:03:42,179
Oh, just kidding.

93
00:03:42,181 --> 00:03:43,380
Nothing.

94
00:03:51,557 --> 00:03:54,942
Sheldon, I'm surprised
you'd choose to go to a pub.

95
00:03:54,944 --> 00:03:56,643
At our committee meeting,

96
00:03:56,645 --> 00:03:59,196
Amy made a motion
for a picnic in a park,

97
00:03:59,198 --> 00:04:01,531
but I tacked so many amendments
on that thing

98
00:04:01,533 --> 00:04:03,867
it sank like a lead balloon.

99
00:04:03,869 --> 00:04:05,953
I then suggested a pub.

100
00:04:05,955 --> 00:04:08,238
Yeah, which I was
initially skeptical of until

101
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:11,291
I saw online that they serve
Yorkshire pudding.

102
00:04:11,293 --> 00:04:13,410
You don't even like
Yorkshire pudding.

103
00:04:13,412 --> 00:04:14,544
No, it's yucky,

104
00:04:14,546 --> 00:04:17,247
but informing people about
the history of Yorkshire

105
00:04:17,249 --> 00:04:19,216
is yummy, yum-yum.

106
00:04:19,218 --> 00:04:21,919
After a lively debate,

107
00:04:21,921 --> 00:04:25,005
that proposal passed
by a two-zero margin.

108
00:04:25,007 --> 00:04:27,224
Nice to see a busy couple

109
00:04:27,226 --> 00:04:28,425
keep the spark
of bureaucracy alive.

110
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:33,597
Ignore them, Amy.
They're just jealous

111
00:04:33,599 --> 00:04:36,767
because they'll never have
a relationship as good as ours.

112
00:04:38,187 --> 00:04:41,822
Isn't this when he says
“bazooka” or something?

113
00:04:41,824 --> 00:04:43,523
I wasn't
making a joke,

114
00:04:43,525 --> 00:04:45,492
I was merely
stating fact.

115
00:04:45,494 --> 00:04:49,363
Amy and I have a superior
relationship to yours.

116
00:04:49,365 --> 00:04:51,698
You don't honestly
think that, do you?

117
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:53,333
Y... Leonard,

118
00:04:53,335 --> 00:04:55,669
I assumed you knew.

119
00:04:56,672 --> 00:04:58,505
The ranking of
relationships in our circle

120
00:04:58,507 --> 00:05:00,841
by quality is:
me and Amy,

121
00:05:00,843 --> 00:05:03,677
Howard and Bernadette,
Raj and his girlfriend,

122
00:05:03,679 --> 00:05:06,513
Penny and Chardonnay,
Penny and you.

123
00:05:09,134 --> 00:05:11,101
There isn't any ranking.

124
00:05:11,103 --> 00:05:14,104
And if there were, we wouldn't
be at the bottom of it.

125
00:05:14,106 --> 00:05:16,940
Yeah, and actually,
I drink Sauvignon Blanc.

126
00:05:18,811 --> 00:05:20,811
That's the part
you have a problem with?

127
00:05:20,813 --> 00:05:22,729
Relax.

128
00:05:22,731 --> 00:05:25,649
There they go,
fighting again.

129
00:05:25,651 --> 00:05:28,485
You'd never hear her talk
that way to Sauvignon Blanc.

130
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:34,074
So you never played
baseball as a kid,

131
00:05:34,076 --> 00:05:35,909
not even
Little League?

132
00:05:35,911 --> 00:05:37,995
Well, I was going to,
but the day of tryouts

133
00:05:37,997 --> 00:05:40,330
I found my dad's
<i>Playboy</i> collection.

134
00:05:42,384 --> 00:05:44,584
Threw my arm out.

135
00:05:46,672 --> 00:05:48,505
All right, the pitcher's mound
in Major League Baseball

136
00:05:48,507 --> 00:05:50,924
is 60 feet, six inches
away from home plate.

137
00:05:50,926 --> 00:05:53,093
Great. You take this

138
00:05:53,095 --> 00:05:55,262
and say when to stop

139
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:02,402
How much further?

140
00:06:02,404 --> 00:06:04,404
Keep going.

141
00:06:06,108 --> 00:06:07,357
How about now?

142
00:06:07,359 --> 00:06:10,110
I'll let you know.

143
00:06:12,281 --> 00:06:15,449
Are you saying “stop” and we're
just too far away to hear you?

144
00:06:15,451 --> 00:06:17,534
Okay, stop.

145
00:06:21,390 --> 00:06:23,690
Are you kidding me?!

146
00:06:23,692 --> 00:06:25,142
That's 60 feet.

147
00:06:25,144 --> 00:06:27,778
There's no way
this is 60 feet.

148
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:30,213
I'm looking at it.

149
00:06:31,216 --> 00:06:32,883
You realize this isn't
one of those times

150
00:06:32,885 --> 00:06:35,969
I want you to exaggerate
how long something is.

151
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:43,310
Okay, I got to...
I-I just...

152
00:06:43,312 --> 00:06:45,395
I got to ask:

153
00:06:45,397 --> 00:06:47,364
what makes you think
that your relationship

154
00:06:47,366 --> 00:06:49,900
is so wonderful
and ours isn't?

155
00:06:49,902 --> 00:06:51,485
For starters,

156
00:06:51,487 --> 00:06:53,653
we enjoy spending time together.

157
00:06:57,626 --> 00:06:59,209
So do we.

158
00:06:59,211 --> 00:07:01,244
And I've seen you guys
ignore each other for hours

159
00:07:01,246 --> 00:07:03,130
doing totally
different things.

160
00:07:03,132 --> 00:07:06,633
It's called parallel play.

161
00:07:06,635 --> 00:07:08,335
Yeah, toddlers
do that.

162
00:07:08,337 --> 00:07:11,254
Not as well as we do.

163
00:07:12,508 --> 00:07:15,258
You believe this guy? He has to
be the best at everything.

164
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:17,477
So what?
Why do you even care?

165
00:07:17,479 --> 00:07:19,096
Oh, listen to them.

166
00:07:19,098 --> 00:07:22,182
Not even married
and the honeymoon's over.

167
00:07:22,184 --> 00:07:24,734
Whatever. You can't
even go on a date

168
00:07:24,736 --> 00:07:26,903
without checking your
relationship agreement.

169
00:07:26,905 --> 00:07:30,574
If you've got a problem basing
a relationship on a contract,

170
00:07:30,576 --> 00:07:33,777
I'd like to tell you
about 13 plucky colonies

171
00:07:33,779 --> 00:07:35,912
that entered
a “relationship agreement”

172
00:07:35,914 --> 00:07:38,532
called the U.S. Constitution.

173
00:07:38,534 --> 00:07:40,867
And it may not be cool
to say so,

174
00:07:40,869 --> 00:07:43,787
but I think that love affair
is still pretty hot today.

175
00:07:46,091 --> 00:07:48,091
It's a good thing I'm not
wearing flag underwear

176
00:07:48,093 --> 00:07:51,461
right now, 'cause there's
about to be a fire.

177
00:07:57,102 --> 00:07:59,302
Okay, it's not
that hard.

178
00:07:59,304 --> 00:08:00,971
You just look to where
you want to throw it,

179
00:08:00,973 --> 00:08:02,272
step towards where
you want to throw,

180
00:08:02,274 --> 00:08:03,640
and throw it.

181
00:08:06,562 --> 00:08:07,811
That's your help?

182
00:08:07,813 --> 00:08:11,148
That's like saying,
“Here's how you fly a plane:

183
00:08:11,150 --> 00:08:12,566
“get in the airplane,

184
00:08:12,568 --> 00:08:16,153
know where you want
to go and fly it.”

185
00:08:17,489 --> 00:08:19,990
Just throw the ball. Let's see what
we're working with.

186
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:27,074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

187
00:08:30,252 --> 00:08:32,002
Come on Howard, fire it in.

188
00:08:57,029 --> 00:08:59,196
Throw the damn ball!

189
00:09:08,669 --> 00:09:10,953
So when do you guys
plan on getting married?

190
00:09:10,955 --> 00:09:13,255
Uh, we're not sure.
But I want to wait long enough

191
00:09:13,257 --> 00:09:15,507
to prove to my mother
I'm not pregnant.

192
00:09:17,345 --> 00:09:19,094
May I have
one of your fries?

193
00:09:19,096 --> 00:09:20,763
Of course.

194
00:09:20,765 --> 00:09:22,631
Can I have a bite
of your burger?

195
00:09:22,633 --> 00:09:24,633
Absolutely not.

196
00:09:24,635 --> 00:09:26,969
Some perfect couple.

197
00:09:26,971 --> 00:09:28,637
He won't even share
his food with her.

198
00:09:28,639 --> 00:09:30,439
It has avocado on it.

199
00:09:30,441 --> 00:09:32,641
She's allergic
to avocado.

200
00:09:32,643 --> 00:09:35,060
Are you so jealous
of our relationship

201
00:09:35,062 --> 00:09:37,730
you want Amy to die?

202
00:09:37,732 --> 00:09:40,032
I'm not jealous.

203
00:09:40,034 --> 00:09:42,318
I just think it's silly for
you to compare relationships

204
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:44,870
like they're something
that can be quantified.

205
00:09:44,872 --> 00:09:46,705
Everything is quantifiable.

206
00:09:46,707 --> 00:09:49,575
That French fry? A seven.

207
00:09:49,577 --> 00:09:51,710
Spider-Man? A nine.

208
00:09:51,712 --> 00:09:55,047
The number nine--
oddly, only a four.

209
00:09:55,049 --> 00:09:56,999
How ridiculous is he?

210
00:09:57,001 --> 00:09:59,335
A hundred.

211
00:10:01,389 --> 00:10:03,555
Sheldon, you're just
assigning random numbers

212
00:10:03,557 --> 00:10:05,424
to things based on your opinion.

213
00:10:05,426 --> 00:10:06,809
No, I'm not.

214
00:10:06,811 --> 00:10:08,727
French fries have
three variables--

215
00:10:08,729 --> 00:10:10,729
crispiness, saltiness
and shape.

216
00:10:10,731 --> 00:10:12,097
Which is why a curly fry

217
00:10:12,099 --> 00:10:13,565
only gets a two.

218
00:10:13,567 --> 00:10:16,852
If I wanted curls for dinner,
I'd order a clown wig.

219
00:10:18,022 --> 00:10:21,740
Well, a relationship is more
complicated than a French fry.

220
00:10:21,742 --> 00:10:25,110
Not according to the work
of Berscheid, Snyder and Omoto.

221
00:10:25,112 --> 00:10:29,198
Oh, what did those
rascals do now?

222
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,700
They developed the Relationship
Closeness Inventory,

223
00:10:31,702 --> 00:10:34,586
which predicts the stability
of a couple based on behavior.

224
00:10:34,588 --> 00:10:35,954
Yeah, not to be confused

225
00:10:35,956 --> 00:10:37,873
with the French Fry
Goodness Inventory.

226
00:10:37,875 --> 00:10:40,459
That's pure Cooper.

227
00:10:40,461 --> 00:10:42,261
So, this is accurate?

228
00:10:42,263 --> 00:10:44,046
It's been around for 25 years,

229
00:10:44,048 --> 00:10:45,714
and has been extensively
corroborated

230
00:10:45,716 --> 00:10:47,016
by other researchers.

231
00:10:47,018 --> 00:10:49,535
Well, kind of takes the romance
out of relationships.

232
00:10:49,537 --> 00:10:52,554
Kind of? It does it perfectly.

233
00:10:53,274 --> 00:10:54,606
Sheldon and I got

234
00:10:54,608 --> 00:10:56,058
an eight-point-two
out of ten.

235
00:10:56,060 --> 00:10:58,894
Fine. We'll take it
right now.

236
00:10:58,896 --> 00:11:00,229
No, don't.
What?

237
00:11:00,231 --> 00:11:01,363
Just don't take it.

238
00:11:01,365 --> 00:11:02,398
Why not?
'Cause it's stupid.

239
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:04,066
Who cares what
number it is?

240
00:11:04,068 --> 00:11:06,402
Come on. It'll be fun.
I said I don't want you to.

241
00:11:06,404 --> 00:11:09,154
I'm getting
another drink.

242
00:11:10,991 --> 00:11:13,208
Sorry.

243
00:11:14,995 --> 00:11:17,946
I'm gonna let you
count this as two dates.

244
00:11:17,948 --> 00:11:20,115
They're a lot of work.

245
00:11:24,505 --> 00:11:26,939
Think he's getting
any better?

246
00:11:29,810 --> 00:11:32,010
Yup.

247
00:11:32,012 --> 00:11:34,279
That was a close one!

248
00:11:34,281 --> 00:11:36,899
Okay!

249
00:11:36,901 --> 00:11:39,101
Is it too late
for him to cancel?

250
00:11:39,103 --> 00:11:40,319
I think so.

251
00:11:44,475 --> 00:11:47,342
Heads up! Watch out!

252
00:11:54,502 --> 00:11:56,618
Are you mad at me?

253
00:11:56,620 --> 00:11:58,871
No, stop being stupid.

254
00:11:58,873 --> 00:12:02,207
Um... whew?

255
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:05,878
Is this about the test,
or is this about us?

256
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:07,796
Look, I don't need
a score on a test

257
00:12:07,798 --> 00:12:10,215
to make me worry about something
I'm already worried about.

258
00:12:10,217 --> 00:12:11,967
What are you worried about?

259
00:12:11,969 --> 00:12:14,970
That we're engaged and
have nothing in common,

260
00:12:14,972 --> 00:12:16,688
and it scares me.

261
00:12:16,690 --> 00:12:19,691
Yeah, that scares me, too.

262
00:12:19,693 --> 00:12:21,193
It does?

263
00:12:21,195 --> 00:12:22,694
Sometimes.

264
00:12:22,696 --> 00:12:25,364
Well, that's not good!

265
00:12:26,650 --> 00:12:29,151
You being blindly infatuated
with me was the rock

266
00:12:29,153 --> 00:12:32,237
we were building
this relationship on!

267
00:12:32,239 --> 00:12:35,824
Okay, well, this might
make you feel better.

268
00:12:35,826 --> 00:12:39,795
Uh, we're both scared that
our marriage will be a disaster,

269
00:12:39,797 --> 00:12:43,582
and so, that's something
that we have in common.

270
00:12:47,204 --> 00:12:50,055
Also, we both think
I'm not funny.

271
00:12:52,226 --> 00:12:55,010
Huh? See, you're not laughing.

272
00:12:59,450 --> 00:13:01,350
Hey, Froot Loops, what's up?

273
00:13:01,352 --> 00:13:03,869
Hey, Mike.

274
00:13:03,871 --> 00:13:06,038
Listen, NASA asked me to

275
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:08,774
throw out the first pitch
at an Angels game.

276
00:13:08,776 --> 00:13:10,843
You got any advice?

277
00:13:10,845 --> 00:13:12,845
Yeah. Don't do it.

278
00:13:14,381 --> 00:13:15,948
What else you up to?

279
00:13:15,950 --> 00:13:18,183
Why shouldn't I do it?

280
00:13:18,185 --> 00:13:19,551
There's no upside.

281
00:13:19,553 --> 00:13:21,587
If you do well, no one cares.

282
00:13:21,589 --> 00:13:23,188
And if you screw up,

283
00:13:23,190 --> 00:13:26,124
you're an idiot
on YouTube forever.

284
00:13:27,161 --> 00:13:29,211
But it's for a good cause.

285
00:13:29,213 --> 00:13:31,513
What about all the kids
that'll be there?

286
00:13:31,515 --> 00:13:32,965
That's what I'm telling you.

287
00:13:32,967 --> 00:13:34,766
Kids are the worst.

288
00:13:36,287 --> 00:13:39,888
My own daughter tweeted
I have a giant nose.

289
00:13:41,275 --> 00:13:43,025
Well, maybe I'll do a good job.

290
00:13:43,027 --> 00:13:44,226
I don't know.

291
00:13:44,228 --> 00:13:46,728
In space,
you couldn't even toss me a pen,

292
00:13:46,730 --> 00:13:49,314
and that was in zero gravity.

293
00:13:50,651 --> 00:13:52,751
Okay, thanks for the pep talk.

294
00:13:52,753 --> 00:13:54,136
Anytime, Froot Loops.

295
00:13:55,072 --> 00:13:56,788
Give your wife a hug for me.

296
00:13:56,790 --> 00:13:59,908
She's so much cuter than you, I
don't know how you ever got her.

297
00:14:01,979 --> 00:14:04,162
He's so nice.

298
00:14:08,002 --> 00:14:10,219
Hey, sorry about that.

299
00:14:10,221 --> 00:14:11,837
No, we're sorry.

300
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:13,755
We never should have been
comparing relationships

301
00:14:13,757 --> 00:14:15,173
in the first place.

302
00:14:15,175 --> 00:14:17,476
Why? We won.

303
00:14:18,646 --> 00:14:20,762
You know, I say, next, we take
on Koothrappali and his dog.

304
00:14:20,764 --> 00:14:23,932
Really give
ourselves a challenge.

305
00:14:23,934 --> 00:14:26,184
I just want to say
one more thing about this.

306
00:14:26,186 --> 00:14:28,270
Just because Penny
and I are very different people

307
00:14:28,272 --> 00:14:30,105
does not mean
that we're a bad couple.

308
00:14:30,107 --> 00:14:33,108
The answer is
one simple test away.

309
00:14:33,110 --> 00:14:34,409
Hmm? You know,
it's like

310
00:14:34,411 --> 00:14:36,778
when I thought there was
a possum in my closet.

311
00:14:36,780 --> 00:14:38,947
Did I sit around
wondering?

312
00:14:38,949 --> 00:14:42,784
No, I sent Leonard in with
a pointy stick and a bag.

313
00:14:42,786 --> 00:14:46,672
I killed
his Chewbacca slippers.

314
00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:50,175
Let's just
take the test.

315
00:14:50,177 --> 00:14:51,627
No, no, no,
I don't want to.

316
00:14:51,629 --> 00:14:53,345
Oh, well, 'cause you
know we're gonna do bad.

317
00:14:53,347 --> 00:14:54,680
Because it doesn't matter.

318
00:14:54,682 --> 00:14:57,466
I don't care
if we're a ten or a two.

319
00:14:57,468 --> 00:15:00,769
Or a one.
A one is possible.

320
00:15:00,771 --> 00:15:03,388
Marriage is scary.

321
00:15:03,390 --> 00:15:04,806
You're scared, I'm scared.

322
00:15:04,808 --> 00:15:07,476
But it doesn't make me
not want to do it.

323
00:15:07,478 --> 00:15:09,528
It-it just...

324
00:15:09,530 --> 00:15:12,898
makes me want to hold your hand
and do it with you.

325
00:15:14,335 --> 00:15:16,318
Leonard...

326
00:15:18,072 --> 00:15:21,490
It would make me so happy
if you said things like that.

327
00:15:21,492 --> 00:15:23,325
We got an
eight-point-two.

328
00:15:23,327 --> 00:15:25,494
Trust me, you're happy.

329
00:15:34,421 --> 00:15:37,806
Mm! I love how they put
a waterfall at center field.

330
00:15:37,808 --> 00:15:40,676
It really ties
the whole stadium together.

331
00:15:40,678 --> 00:15:42,978
Look at you, talking sports.

332
00:15:44,815 --> 00:15:46,098
This is fun, huh?

333
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:48,350
We get to see our friend
throw out the first pitch,

334
00:15:48,352 --> 00:15:49,901
have a hot dog,
watch the game.

335
00:15:49,903 --> 00:15:51,770
Whoa.

336
00:15:51,772 --> 00:15:54,072
Nobody said anything
about watching the game.

337
00:15:55,159 --> 00:15:57,442
Sheldon, what
did you expect?

338
00:15:57,444 --> 00:16:01,697
I expected to see Howard throw
the baseball, finish my hot dog,

339
00:16:01,699 --> 00:16:04,082
and hightail it across
the street to Disneyland

340
00:16:04,084 --> 00:16:07,536
just in time for Mickey's
Soundsational Parade.

341
00:16:07,538 --> 00:16:09,121
I'll tell you what.

342
00:16:09,123 --> 00:16:13,291
If we stay, I'll buy you
cotton candy and a bobblehead.

343
00:16:13,293 --> 00:16:15,043
Who's the bobblehead of?

344
00:16:15,045 --> 00:16:16,678
Does it matter?

345
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:19,548
No, as long as it bobbles.

346
00:16:20,884 --> 00:16:23,051
Howie, I am so proud of you.

347
00:16:23,053 --> 00:16:26,054
Thanks.
I'm proud of me, too.

348
00:16:26,056 --> 00:16:27,305
Mm-hmm.

349
00:16:27,307 --> 00:16:28,974
You ready?

350
00:16:28,976 --> 00:16:30,225
Let's do it.

351
00:16:30,227 --> 00:16:31,443
All right.

352
00:16:32,896 --> 00:16:34,946
Wish me luck.

353
00:16:34,948 --> 00:16:36,365
Go get 'em.

354
00:16:36,367 --> 00:16:37,783
Ladies and gentlemen,

355
00:16:37,785 --> 00:16:40,535
in honor of Space Day at
Angel Stadium, the first pitch

356
00:16:40,537 --> 00:16:45,240
will be thrown out by NASA
astronaut Howard Wolowitz.

357
00:16:48,162 --> 00:16:49,411
Thank you.

358
00:16:49,413 --> 00:16:51,329
Thank you.

359
00:16:51,331 --> 00:16:52,914
Can he really
throw a ball?

360
00:16:52,916 --> 00:16:57,085
On our Quidditch team, he...
Yeah, that's a “no.”

361
00:16:57,087 --> 00:17:01,890
I have a message
for the young people here today.

362
00:17:01,892 --> 00:17:04,676
When I was asked
to throw the first pitch,

363
00:17:04,678 --> 00:17:09,848
a little voice in my head said
I couldn't do it.

364
00:17:09,850 --> 00:17:13,101
So, I practiced and practiced,

365
00:17:13,103 --> 00:17:15,187
and you know what?

366
00:17:15,189 --> 00:17:17,606
That little voice...

367
00:17:17,608 --> 00:17:20,158
...was right, but...

368
00:17:21,662 --> 00:17:25,430
...then I remembered
that I'm not an athlete.

369
00:17:25,432 --> 00:17:27,716
I'm a scientist.

370
00:17:27,718 --> 00:17:29,117
So, today's

371
00:17:29,119 --> 00:17:31,453
first pitch will be delivered

372
00:17:31,455 --> 00:17:34,372
to home plate by science.

373
00:17:34,374 --> 00:17:35,874
Ladies and gentlemen,

374
00:17:35,876 --> 00:17:38,293
boys and girls, I present to you

375
00:17:38,295 --> 00:17:44,049
a working prototype
of the Mars Rover!

376
00:17:48,605 --> 00:17:51,223
And here's the wind-up...

377
00:17:51,225 --> 00:17:53,058
and the pitch!

378
00:18:04,655 --> 00:18:06,988
Why is it going so slow?!

379
00:18:06,990 --> 00:18:10,075
'Cause I'm an idiot
who didn't think this through!

380
00:18:10,994 --> 00:18:12,544
Okay, new plan.

381
00:18:12,546 --> 00:18:14,162
We go to Disneyland,

382
00:18:14,164 --> 00:18:16,581
play hide and seek
on Tom Sawyer's Island,

383
00:18:16,583 --> 00:18:20,001
and then come back
and see the end of the pitch.

384
00:18:29,346 --> 00:18:32,147
Okay, while we're waiting
for the ball to arrive,

385
00:18:32,149 --> 00:18:34,149
here's some fun facts
about Mars.

386
00:18:34,151 --> 00:18:37,519
You suck, Wolowitz!

387
00:18:38,739 --> 00:18:41,273
He makes a valid point!

388
00:19:01,162 --> 00:19:03,812
Okay, booing isn't gonna make it
go any faster!
