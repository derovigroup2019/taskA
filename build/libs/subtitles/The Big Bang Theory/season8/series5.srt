1
00:00:02,731 --> 00:00:05,815
Hey, I read
that someone invented a way

2
00:00:05,817 --> 00:00:08,234
to convert your footsteps
into electromagnetic energy

3
00:00:08,236 --> 00:00:10,153
so you can charge
your cell phone while walking.

4
00:00:10,155 --> 00:00:12,405
We had that idea years ago.

5
00:00:12,407 --> 00:00:14,273
How come we never
did anything with it?

6
00:00:14,275 --> 00:00:16,776
Probably because we left the
diagram of it in the restaurant,

7
00:00:16,778 --> 00:00:19,212
and none of us
wanted to walk back.

8
00:00:19,214 --> 00:00:23,082
I know the real reason you never
made progress with that idea.

9
00:00:23,084 --> 00:00:24,534
You thought of it

10
00:00:24,536 --> 00:00:26,586
September 22, 2007.

11
00:00:26,588 --> 00:00:28,955
Two days later, Penny moved in,

12
00:00:28,957 --> 00:00:31,124
and so much blood rushed
to your genitals,

13
00:00:31,126 --> 00:00:33,042
your brain became a ghost town.

14
00:00:34,763 --> 00:00:36,746
That's not what happened.

15
00:00:36,748 --> 00:00:38,464
I remember it distinctly

16
00:00:38,466 --> 00:00:40,767
because I had just
composed my annual poem

17
00:00:40,769 --> 00:00:43,720
commemorating the anniversary
of Dr. Seuss's death.

18
00:00:43,722 --> 00:00:44,971
No one wants
to hear it.

19
00:00:44,973 --> 00:00:46,472
Why, die.

20
00:00:46,474 --> 00:00:48,024
Why did he die?

21
00:00:48,026 --> 00:00:49,359
Old, told.

22
00:00:49,361 --> 00:00:51,310
I was told he was old.

23
00:00:51,312 --> 00:00:54,614
Penny is not the reason
I didn't pursue that idea.

24
00:00:54,616 --> 00:00:56,733
Oh, really?
Since meeting her,

25
00:00:56,735 --> 00:00:58,901
what have been
your greatest accomplishments?

26
00:00:58,903 --> 00:01:00,036
Easy.

27
00:01:00,038 --> 00:01:02,038
Sleeping with Penny.

28
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:04,824
Getting Penny to go back out
with him after she dumped him.

29
00:01:04,826 --> 00:01:07,160
Tricking Penny
into getting engaged.

30
00:01:07,162 --> 00:01:10,329
And a few weeks ago,
he almost did a pull-up.

31
00:01:11,416 --> 00:01:14,484
I think
someone owes me an apology.

32
00:01:14,486 --> 00:01:16,836
Well, don't feel bad.

33
00:01:16,838 --> 00:01:18,971
I think we've all
been distracted

34
00:01:18,973 --> 00:01:20,790
since the girls
entered our lives.

35
00:01:20,792 --> 00:01:22,592
You admit Amy's a distraction?

36
00:01:22,594 --> 00:01:25,178
Oh, very much so.
Listen to this.

37
00:01:25,180 --> 00:01:27,180
This is from two days ago.

38
00:01:27,182 --> 00:01:29,849
“Hi. Hope you're having
a good day.”

39
00:01:29,851 --> 00:01:32,385
Who has time
for this constant sexting?

40
00:01:33,188 --> 00:01:36,689
Well, maybe
we<i> have</i> lost our focus.

41
00:01:36,691 --> 00:01:40,326
It wouldn't kill us to get
together and brainstorm ideas.

42
00:01:40,328 --> 00:01:42,862
Ooh, we could have one
of those retreats.

43
00:01:42,864 --> 00:01:44,247
Like our own science retreat.

44
00:01:44,249 --> 00:01:46,499
My cousin has a cabin
out in the woods.

45
00:01:46,501 --> 00:01:48,868
I'm not going to a
cabin in the woods.

46
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:52,121
Did you see the movie
<i>Cabin in the Woods?</i>

47
00:01:52,123 --> 00:01:53,423
Then we'll go to a hotel.

48
00:01:53,425 --> 00:01:56,592
A hotel?
Did you see<i> The Shining?</i>

49
00:01:56,594 --> 00:01:58,511
We could go up

50
00:01:58,513 --> 00:02:00,763
to Big Bear
and get a house on the lake.

51
00:02:00,765 --> 00:02:03,382
Did you see
<i>The Lake House?</i>

52
00:02:03,384 --> 00:02:05,718
Nothing bad happens
in<i> The Lake House.</i>

53
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:09,088
Yeah, well, no,
not to them. To me.

54
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:10,223
Time traveling mailbox.

55
00:02:10,225 --> 00:02:11,441
The only time that traveled

56
00:02:11,443 --> 00:02:14,143
was an hour and half
of my life down the toilet.

57
00:02:14,145 --> 00:02:15,945
Fine. Then we'll just stay here
and do it.

58
00:02:15,947 --> 00:02:17,647
Well, you didn't suggest
a beach house.

59
00:02:17,649 --> 00:02:18,998
You would go to a beach house?

60
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,367
Well, good Lord, no--
have you seen<i> Jaws?</i>

61
00:02:22,737 --> 00:02:26,372
? Our whole universe
was in a hot, dense state ?

62
00:02:26,374 --> 00:02:29,709
? Then nearly 14 billion years
ago expansion started... Wait! ?

63
00:02:29,711 --> 00:02:31,294
? The Earth began to cool ?

64
00:02:31,296 --> 00:02:33,846
? The autotrophs began to drool,
Neanderthals developed tools ?

65
00:02:33,848 --> 00:02:36,499
? We built the Wall ?
?<i> We built the pyramids</i> ?

66
00:02:36,501 --> 00:02:39,135
? Math, Science, History,
unraveling the mystery ?

67
00:02:39,137 --> 00:02:41,087
? That all started
with a big bang ?

68
00:02:41,089 --> 00:02:42,109
?<i> Bang!</i> ?

69
00:02:42,110 --> 00:02:46,110

71
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:53,276
Hey.
Hey.

72
00:02:53,278 --> 00:02:54,911
So, the guys and
I are talking

73
00:02:54,913 --> 00:02:57,113
about having kind of a
science retreat this weekend.

74
00:02:57,115 --> 00:02:58,365
I just wanted to
know if that's okay.

75
00:02:58,367 --> 00:03:00,333
You and I had talked about
going to brunch on Sunday...

76
00:03:00,335 --> 00:03:01,785
Want to go to Vegas
this weekend?

77
00:03:01,787 --> 00:03:02,919
Of course I do.

78
00:03:02,921 --> 00:03:04,087
Bernadette?

79
00:03:04,089 --> 00:03:05,422
Girl's weekend.
Vegas. You in?

80
00:03:05,424 --> 00:03:07,007
Hell, yeah!
Yes!

81
00:03:07,009 --> 00:03:09,125
I'll check flights.
I'll check hotels.

82
00:03:09,127 --> 00:03:11,544
I'll check my underpants.
I'm so excited, I think I peed.

83

84
00:03:20,288 --> 00:03:22,472
They seem okay with it.

85
00:03:26,028 --> 00:03:28,194
Hey.

86
00:03:28,196 --> 00:03:30,113
Hey.
Hey. I didn't think you'd make it.

87
00:03:30,115 --> 00:03:31,614
Why not?
Well, 'cause you have

88
00:03:31,616 --> 00:03:33,149
a steady girlfriend now,
and we assumed

89
00:03:33,151 --> 00:03:36,369
you'd have to stay home to lower
the food down to her in the pit.

90
00:03:40,909 --> 00:03:44,160
For your information,
Emily is working tonight.

91
00:03:44,162 --> 00:03:46,446
Yeah, one would assume,
on getting out of the pit.

92
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:50,133
Okay, let's focus.

93
00:03:50,135 --> 00:03:52,052
The girls are gone,
we have 48 hours.

94
00:03:52,054 --> 00:03:54,387
There are no distractions.
Let's change the world.

95
00:03:54,389 --> 00:03:56,973
Thinking caps on.
Here we go.

96
00:03:56,975 --> 00:03:58,475
Ooh, this is exciting.
We're innovating.

97
00:03:58,477 --> 00:04:00,477
I feel like
we're in the Facebook movie.

98
00:04:00,479 --> 00:04:02,095
Oh. I never saw that.

99
00:04:02,097 --> 00:04:03,897
- Yeah. Really?
- Oh.

100
00:04:03,899 --> 00:04:06,015
It's wonderful, and I swear
I'm not saying that

101
00:04:06,017 --> 00:04:08,184
because Justin Timberlake
is in it.

102
00:04:09,354 --> 00:04:11,154
Yeah, I have it on Blu-ray.

103
00:04:11,156 --> 00:04:12,522
We should watch it.

104
00:04:12,524 --> 00:04:14,741
Cool. I'll make the popcorn.

105
00:04:15,577 --> 00:04:16,993
Guys...

106
00:04:16,995 --> 00:04:18,328
in 30 seconds, we went from

107
00:04:18,330 --> 00:04:20,713
“Let's change the world”
to “Let's watch TV.”

108
00:04:21,450 --> 00:04:24,317
I'm sorry. Is that a “no”?

109
00:04:24,319 --> 00:04:25,668
Okay. No.

110
00:04:25,670 --> 00:04:26,920
Leonard's right.
We're here to focus.

111
00:04:26,922 --> 00:04:29,005
Didn't we used
to have a list of all our ideas?

112
00:04:29,007 --> 00:04:30,707
I-I think I still have it.

113
00:04:30,709 --> 00:04:32,392
I did not get a clear answer.

114
00:04:32,394 --> 00:04:34,511
I'm gonna set this down now.

115
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:37,097
Ah, here it is.

116
00:04:37,099 --> 00:04:38,765
Whoa.

117
00:04:38,767 --> 00:04:40,550
I haven't looked
at these in years.

118
00:04:40,552 --> 00:04:42,218
“Robot girlfriend.”

119
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:44,521
Mm, that was mine.

120
00:04:44,523 --> 00:04:47,891
“Robot prostitute.”

121
00:04:47,893 --> 00:04:50,443
Also mine.

122
00:04:50,445 --> 00:04:51,711
Wait. I'm confused.

123
00:04:51,713 --> 00:04:53,663
Why would you need
both a robot girlfriend

124
00:04:53,665 --> 00:04:55,231
and a robot prostitute?

125
00:04:55,233 --> 00:04:56,900
There's just some things
you don't do

126
00:04:56,902 --> 00:04:58,518
with your robot girlfriend.

127
00:05:00,739 --> 00:05:02,405
Boy, when you met Bernadette,

128
00:05:02,407 --> 00:05:05,158
the field of robotics
really took a hit.

129
00:05:06,077 --> 00:05:07,293
Okay, let's just skip

130
00:05:07,295 --> 00:05:09,913
all the inventions
you can have sex with.

131
00:05:15,754 --> 00:05:17,887
All right, no-- here we go:

132
00:05:17,889 --> 00:05:19,722
“Ergonomic heated seat cushion”"

133
00:05:19,724 --> 00:05:21,257
No, it vibrates.
Keep going.

134
00:05:24,312 --> 00:05:26,729
You know, let's just come up
with something new.

135
00:05:26,731 --> 00:05:28,064
You know,

136
00:05:28,066 --> 00:05:30,266
a number of significant
innovations have been inspired

137
00:05:30,268 --> 00:05:31,768
by science fiction.

138
00:05:31,770 --> 00:05:34,437
The-the geosynchronous satellite
from Arthur C. Clarke.

139
00:05:34,439 --> 00:05:37,607
The Motorola flip phone--
that came from<i> Star Trek.</i>

140
00:05:37,609 --> 00:05:39,943
Yeah, and I've long suspected
that the idea

141
00:05:39,945 --> 00:05:42,045
of an African-American president
was stolen

142
00:05:42,047 --> 00:05:44,797
from the movie<i> Deep Impact.</i>

143
00:05:45,784 --> 00:05:47,417
Hey,

144
00:05:47,419 --> 00:05:49,936
the future they show
in<i> Back to the Future II</i>

145
00:05:49,938 --> 00:05:51,671
is only a year away.

146
00:05:51,673 --> 00:05:54,207
A lot of the things in that
movie haven't been invented yet.

147
00:05:54,209 --> 00:05:55,425
How cool would that be

148
00:05:55,427 --> 00:05:56,960
if we could make
one of those a reality?

149
00:05:56,962 --> 00:05:59,045
If we could figure out
the scientific basis

150
00:05:59,047 --> 00:06:00,296
for Marty's hover board,

151
00:06:00,298 --> 00:06:02,732
that would have
universal application.

152
00:06:02,734 --> 00:06:04,968
Well, it's-it's possible
at absolute zero,

153
00:06:04,970 --> 00:06:06,119
but we would
have to remove

154
00:06:06,121 --> 00:06:07,804
the temperature restrictions.

155
00:06:07,806 --> 00:06:09,088
Oh, I have an idea.

156
00:06:09,090 --> 00:06:10,356
I think I have the same one.

157
00:06:10,358 --> 00:06:12,492
We got to watch
<i>Back to the Future II!</i>

158
00:06:13,311 --> 00:06:16,529
I'll make the popcorn.

159
00:06:18,984 --> 00:06:20,533
So, where should
we go first?

160
00:06:20,535 --> 00:06:21,668
Ooh.

161
00:06:21,670 --> 00:06:23,319
There's a cover band
in the lounge.

162
00:06:23,321 --> 00:06:25,388
Nah.
But they play Barry Manilow.

163
00:06:25,390 --> 00:06:29,342
No.
But they're called “Fairly Manilow”"

164
00:06:30,245 --> 00:06:31,628
Oh. Okay.

165
00:06:31,630 --> 00:06:33,162
Great!
No!

166
00:06:34,082 --> 00:06:36,132
Well, what do you want
to do?

167
00:06:36,134 --> 00:06:37,467
Well, we're in Vegas.

168
00:06:37,469 --> 00:06:39,819
I want to go downstairs,
get a bucket of margaritas,

169
00:06:39,821 --> 00:06:42,005
dance until I vomit
all over a roulette wheel

170
00:06:42,007 --> 00:06:43,523
and watch it go everywhere.

171
00:06:44,843 --> 00:06:46,342
What if we don't want to vomit?

172
00:06:46,344 --> 00:06:49,262
Oh, you will. That's why
they give you the bucket.

173
00:06:50,432 --> 00:06:52,098
Uh-oh.
What?

174
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:53,600
It's my boss.

175
00:06:53,602 --> 00:06:55,685
They moved my field ride
up to Monday.

176
00:06:55,687 --> 00:06:56,819
What does that mean?

177
00:06:56,821 --> 00:06:58,938
It means instead
of having a week to study,

178
00:06:58,940 --> 00:07:00,189
I only have two days.

179
00:07:00,191 --> 00:07:01,324
That sucks.

180
00:07:01,326 --> 00:07:02,976
Can you start
in the morning?

181
00:07:02,978 --> 00:07:04,027
Uh, it's kind of a lot.

182
00:07:04,029 --> 00:07:05,695
You know,
let me do a little tonight,

183
00:07:05,697 --> 00:07:07,363
and I'll catch up
with you guys later.

184
00:07:07,365 --> 00:07:09,699
You sure?
Yeah, it's okay. Go ahead.

185
00:07:11,536 --> 00:07:13,503
So, um, now that
Penny's not coming...

186
00:07:13,505 --> 00:07:15,755
We're not seeing Fairly Manilow.
Okay.

187
00:07:23,298 --> 00:07:25,281
Hold on. Pause.

188
00:07:25,283 --> 00:07:27,467
Something doesn't make sense.
Look...

189
00:07:29,054 --> 00:07:31,688
In 2015, Biff steals
the sports almanac

190
00:07:31,690 --> 00:07:33,640
and takes the time machine

191
00:07:33,642 --> 00:07:37,477
back to 1955, to give it
to his younger self.

192
00:07:37,479 --> 00:07:40,647
But as soon as he does that,
he changes the future,

193
00:07:40,649 --> 00:07:42,982
so the 2015 he
returns to would be

194
00:07:42,984 --> 00:07:47,070
a different 2015, not the 2015
that Marty and Doc were in.

195
00:07:47,072 --> 00:07:50,089
This is<i> Hot Tub Time Machine</i>
all over again.

196
00:07:53,161 --> 00:07:55,411
If future Biff
goes back to 2015

197
00:07:55,413 --> 00:07:57,297
right after he gives
young Biff the almanac,

198
00:07:57,299 --> 00:08:00,416
he could get back to the 2015
with Marty and Doc in it.

199
00:08:00,418 --> 00:08:03,720
Because it wasn't until
his 21st birthday

200
00:08:03,722 --> 00:08:05,838
that 1955 Biff
placed his first bet.

201
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:06,973
Wait. Whoa, whoa.

202
00:08:06,975 --> 00:08:08,725
Is “placed” right?

203
00:08:08,727 --> 00:08:09,642
What do you mean?

204
00:08:09,644 --> 00:08:11,811
Is “placed” the right tense

205
00:08:11,813 --> 00:08:14,013
for something that would have
happened in the future

206
00:08:14,015 --> 00:08:17,100
of a past that was affected
by something from the future?

207
00:08:17,102 --> 00:08:21,070
Had will have placed?

208
00:08:21,072 --> 00:08:23,606
That's my boy.

209
00:08:24,776 --> 00:08:28,661
Okay, so, it wasn't until
his 21st birthday

210
00:08:28,663 --> 00:08:30,697
that Biff had will have
placed his first bet

211
00:08:30,699 --> 00:08:32,115
and made his millions.

212
00:08:32,117 --> 00:08:34,250
That's when
he altered the timeline.

213
00:08:34,252 --> 00:08:36,969
Yeah, but he had will
haven't placed it!

214
00:08:38,256 --> 00:08:41,457
What?!

215
00:08:41,459 --> 00:08:43,459
Unlike<i> Hot Tub Time Machine,</i>

216
00:08:43,461 --> 00:08:45,545
this couldn't be more simple.

217
00:08:45,547 --> 00:08:47,547
When Biff gets the almanac
in 1955,

218
00:08:47,549 --> 00:08:49,966
the alternate future
he creates isn't the one

219
00:08:49,968 --> 00:08:52,852
in which Marty and Doc Brown
ever use the time machine

220
00:08:52,854 --> 00:08:54,187
to travel to 2015.

221
00:08:54,189 --> 00:08:55,138
Therefore,

222
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:56,606
in the new timeline,

223
00:08:56,608 --> 00:08:58,608
Marty and Doc never brought
the time machine...

224
00:08:58,610 --> 00:08:59,692
W-Wait.

225
00:08:59,694 --> 00:09:01,277
Is “brought” right?

226
00:09:05,166 --> 00:09:09,635
Marty and Doc never
had have had brought?

227
00:09:10,488 --> 00:09:12,789
I don't know.
You did it to me.

228
00:09:12,791 --> 00:09:15,375
Oh, I'm going with it.

229
00:09:15,377 --> 00:09:18,161
Marty and Doc never
had have had brought

230
00:09:18,163 --> 00:09:20,463
the time machine to 2015.

231
00:09:20,465 --> 00:09:23,049
That means 2015 Biff could also

232
00:09:23,051 --> 00:09:27,003
not had have had brought
the almanac to 1955 Biff.

233
00:09:27,005 --> 00:09:31,674
Therefore, the timeline in which
1955 Biff gets the almanac

234
00:09:31,676 --> 00:09:33,176
is also the timeline

235
00:09:33,178 --> 00:09:36,012
in which 1955 Biff
<i>never</i> gets the almanac.

236
00:09:36,014 --> 00:09:37,847
And not just “never gets.”

237
00:09:37,849 --> 00:09:41,834
Never have, never hasn't,
never had have hasn't.

238
00:09:46,891 --> 00:09:48,124
He's right.

239
00:09:50,028 --> 00:09:52,912
Also, what kind of name is Biff?

240
00:09:52,914 --> 00:09:55,481
Sounds like when you pop open
a can of Pillsbury dough.

241
00:09:55,483 --> 00:09:58,084
Biff.

242
00:09:59,587 --> 00:10:02,672
Oh, that stuff is so good
wrapped around cocktail weenies.

243
00:10:02,674 --> 00:10:03,623
Guys...

244
00:10:03,625 --> 00:10:04,841
Do you know that
the word “wiener”

245
00:10:04,843 --> 00:10:06,042
comes from the German name

246
00:10:06,044 --> 00:10:07,376
of the Austrian capital
Vienna, or “Wien”?

247
00:10:07,378 --> 00:10:09,712
Do you know if you look
at Austria on a map

248
00:10:09,714 --> 00:10:11,130
it actually looks like a wiener?

249
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:13,800
Guys, what are
we doing?

250
00:10:13,802 --> 00:10:14,967
W-We sent the girls away

251
00:10:14,969 --> 00:10:16,185
so we could focus.

252
00:10:16,187 --> 00:10:19,305
I don't think it worked.

253
00:10:34,708 --> 00:10:38,944
Maybe after this, you'll be
in the mood for some Manilow.

254
00:10:38,946 --> 00:10:42,030
I think after this,
I'll be dead.

255
00:10:42,032 --> 00:10:44,065
Look at us out,

256
00:10:44,067 --> 00:10:45,951
while Penny's in
the room studying.

257
00:10:45,953 --> 00:10:47,202
I'm proud of her.

258
00:10:47,204 --> 00:10:48,336
This is a great opportunity.

259
00:10:48,338 --> 00:10:50,205
It's nice to see her take it
seriously.

260
00:10:50,207 --> 00:10:51,207
It is.

261
00:10:51,208 --> 00:10:52,208
But enough about Penny.

262
00:10:52,209 --> 00:10:54,009
Let's talk about us.

263
00:10:54,011 --> 00:10:56,344
We're looking good.

264
00:10:56,346 --> 00:10:58,430
We are...

265
00:10:58,432 --> 00:11:00,098
Better than good.

266
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:03,518
I mean, look at you.
Your body's bangin'!

267
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:05,303
Amy!

268
00:11:05,305 --> 00:11:06,638
Don't “Amy” me.

269
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:07,639
We're always talking
about how hot Penny is.

270
00:11:07,641 --> 00:11:09,975
Come on-- scientist
to scientist,

271
00:11:09,977 --> 00:11:13,645
how big are those
Hadron Colliders?

272
00:11:15,482 --> 00:11:17,899
You're embarrassing me.

273
00:11:17,901 --> 00:11:18,984
Oh, don't be embarrassed.

274
00:11:18,986 --> 00:11:21,319
I'll show you the divot
in my spine.

275
00:11:21,321 --> 00:11:21,930
What?

276
00:11:21,954 --> 00:11:23,873
No, no, it's okay.
I was born with it.

277
00:11:23,874 --> 00:11:26,074
If you put a double-A
battery in there,

278
00:11:26,076 --> 00:11:28,960
it makes my leg kick.

279
00:11:31,131 --> 00:11:32,163
All right.

280
00:11:32,165 --> 00:11:34,416
Oh, this is already better.
There are

281
00:11:34,418 --> 00:11:36,801
far fewer distractions in here.

282
00:11:36,803 --> 00:11:37,919
Plus, this is where our minds

283
00:11:37,921 --> 00:11:39,220
are conditioned
to focus on work.

284
00:11:39,222 --> 00:11:40,922
So, I've been thinking
about the hover boards,

285
00:11:40,924 --> 00:11:43,641
and maybe there's a way
we could use Maglev technology.

286
00:11:43,643 --> 00:11:46,344
Or if we could figure out a
way to supercool the materials,

287
00:11:46,346 --> 00:11:47,979
we could utilize
quantum coupling.

288
00:11:47,981 --> 00:11:50,148
Well, I wonder
if anyone's tried that.

289
00:11:50,150 --> 00:11:51,649
Go online and look it up.

290
00:11:51,651 --> 00:11:53,234
Oh, I can't argue with him.

291
00:11:53,236 --> 00:11:54,686
It's right there on the screen.

292
00:11:54,688 --> 00:11:58,239
Austria does look like a wiener.

293
00:11:59,276 --> 00:12:00,408
That's nothing, dude.

294
00:12:00,410 --> 00:12:02,560
Go check out
how hung Florida is.

295
00:12:04,664 --> 00:12:06,781
I'm sure Mrs. Florida's
walking funny.

296
00:12:06,783 --> 00:12:08,199
Can we get back to work?

297
00:12:09,453 --> 00:12:10,952
Yeah... he's right.

298
00:12:10,954 --> 00:12:13,171
Oh, here's a thought.

299
00:12:13,173 --> 00:12:16,624
What if we use some form of
operant conditioning techniques

300
00:12:16,626 --> 00:12:18,593
to keep us from
getting off topic?

301
00:12:18,595 --> 00:12:20,462
Like behavior modification?

302
00:12:20,464 --> 00:12:21,513
Yeah, exactly.

303
00:12:21,515 --> 00:12:22,781
Did you know

304
00:12:22,783 --> 00:12:25,216
those techniques were used
to actually teach pigeons

305
00:12:25,218 --> 00:12:26,768
to play ping-pong?

306
00:12:26,770 --> 00:12:28,803
That cannot be true.

307
00:12:38,648 --> 00:12:41,649
Hey, it was match point.

308
00:12:42,486 --> 00:12:44,202
Some psychologists

309
00:12:44,204 --> 00:12:46,154
perform operant conditioning
with punishment.

310
00:12:46,156 --> 00:12:47,622
Maybe we can come up
with a punishment

311
00:12:47,624 --> 00:12:49,491
for straying off topic.

312
00:12:49,493 --> 00:12:54,245
Not getting to see who wins at
pigeon ping-pong comes to mind.

313
00:12:54,247 --> 00:12:56,414
We could snap a rubber
band on our wrists

314
00:12:56,416 --> 00:12:58,383
every time we
get sidetracked.

315
00:12:58,385 --> 00:13:01,836
Mmm, not bad.
You know, in medieval times,

316
00:13:01,838 --> 00:13:04,005
idle chatter was punished
with a device called

317
00:13:04,007 --> 00:13:05,673
the scold's bridle.

318
00:13:05,675 --> 00:13:07,258
It's an iron cage

319
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:11,346
that's locked around the head
and pierces the tongue.

320
00:13:11,348 --> 00:13:14,549
If only we had one.

321
00:13:15,619 --> 00:13:17,819
Oh! I'll check Amazon.

322
00:13:23,143 --> 00:13:25,493
Housekeeping!

323
00:13:27,330 --> 00:13:28,947
We had a complaint

324
00:13:28,949 --> 00:13:32,467
about somebody pooping
on a party in there!

325
00:13:34,888 --> 00:13:37,539
It was us the whole time!

326
00:13:38,675 --> 00:13:40,542
Why'd you tell her?
It was working.

327
00:13:40,544 --> 00:13:42,010
Was it working?

328
00:13:42,012 --> 00:13:44,429
Yeah.

329
00:13:44,431 --> 00:13:47,182
Oh, I'm so sorry.

330
00:13:47,184 --> 00:13:50,051
You guys look
like you're having fun.

331
00:13:50,053 --> 00:13:51,553
We're having
the best time.

332
00:13:51,555 --> 00:13:56,057
Guess who won $100
playing craps.

333
00:13:56,059 --> 00:13:57,559
That's a dollar.

334
00:13:57,561 --> 00:14:01,146
Then guess who wildly overtipped
a cocktail waitress.

335
00:14:01,148 --> 00:14:03,615
Hey, Penny... hey, let's go.

336
00:14:03,617 --> 00:14:06,951
We found a place that has
Australian male strippers.

337
00:14:06,953 --> 00:14:08,069
We want to see

338
00:14:08,071 --> 00:14:10,405
if they twirl their junk
in the other direction.

339
00:14:20,834 --> 00:14:22,750
That sounds so great.

340
00:14:22,752 --> 00:14:25,253
But I have
a little more studying to do.

341
00:14:25,255 --> 00:14:28,056
Can you
believe this nerd?

342
00:14:29,092 --> 00:14:31,926
Come on, do you want to
sit here being a loser,

343
00:14:31,928 --> 00:14:33,094
or do you want to watch me climb

344
00:14:33,096 --> 00:14:34,596
into an Australian man's
G-string

345
00:14:34,598 --> 00:14:36,764
like a baby kangaroo?

346
00:14:42,105 --> 00:14:45,240
All right, guys, look,
I would love to go out,

347
00:14:45,242 --> 00:14:46,774
but I've got
to get this done, okay?

348
00:14:46,776 --> 00:14:48,943
So have fun at the club.
And if you get

349
00:14:48,945 --> 00:14:50,445
in trouble, find a policeman.

350
00:14:50,447 --> 00:14:52,280
And if he's taking off
his pants,

351
00:14:52,282 --> 00:14:54,666
he is not a real policeman.

352
00:14:54,668 --> 00:14:58,203
Okay, okay, this is obviously
very important to her.

353
00:14:58,205 --> 00:15:01,372
Let's just, we'll help her study
so she can get done quicker.

354
00:15:01,374 --> 00:15:03,091
Here...
here, I'm gonna quiz you.

355
00:15:03,093 --> 00:15:05,760
I'm gonna quiz you.

356
00:15:05,762 --> 00:15:08,129
I got your notes!

357
00:15:08,131 --> 00:15:09,347
I got your notes!

358
00:15:09,349 --> 00:15:11,266
I got your notes!
If you want these,

359
00:15:11,268 --> 00:15:14,369
they're gonna be
at the strip club!

360
00:15:15,855 --> 00:15:17,805
Aren't you gonna chase her?

361
00:15:17,807 --> 00:15:20,108
To the walk-in closet? Sure.

362
00:15:27,817 --> 00:15:29,150
Okay, so we agree,

363
00:15:29,152 --> 00:15:30,485
whenever someone
takes us off topic

364
00:15:30,487 --> 00:15:33,788
they get their arm
hair yanked off.

365
00:15:33,790 --> 00:15:34,906
And I really
can't let that happen

366
00:15:34,908 --> 00:15:36,291
or the girl who does
my eyebrows will think

367
00:15:36,293 --> 00:15:37,792
I've been cheating on her.

368
00:15:38,828 --> 00:15:42,330
All right, now, one benefit
of quantum coupling...

369
00:15:42,332 --> 00:15:43,715
Wait, no, question:

370
00:15:43,717 --> 00:15:45,750
who decides if someone's
gone off topic?

371
00:15:45,752 --> 00:15:48,336
I think it'll be pretty clear.
If not, we'll take a vote.

372
00:15:48,338 --> 00:15:50,054
Oh, and also...

373
00:15:50,056 --> 00:15:52,674
Ow!

374
00:15:52,676 --> 00:15:54,759
W-We didn't vote!

375
00:15:54,761 --> 00:15:56,928
We didn't have to--
that was clearly a tangent.

376
00:15:56,930 --> 00:15:58,596
Now come on.
Back to work.

377
00:15:58,598 --> 00:16:00,481
If we're leaning towards
quantum coupling...

378
00:16:00,483 --> 00:16:02,600
Aah! Why?

379
00:16:02,602 --> 00:16:04,319
You said
“quantum coupling.”

380
00:16:04,321 --> 00:16:06,521
That made me think
of the show<i> Quantum Leap.</i>

381
00:16:06,523 --> 00:16:08,213
That's a tangent
and it's your fault.

382
00:16:08,213 --> 00:16:09,602
That's ridiculous.

383
00:16:09,626 --> 00:16:11,626
Sheldon, I vote that
is not a tangent.

384
00:16:12,078 --> 00:16:13,695
Thank you.
And now I owe you one.

385
00:16:13,697 --> 00:16:15,780
Ow!

386
00:16:15,782 --> 00:16:17,532
That was your fault.

387
00:16:17,534 --> 00:16:19,083
Hey!

388
00:16:19,085 --> 00:16:21,336
Ooh, that is a lot of hair.

389
00:16:22,005 --> 00:16:23,588
Ow!

390
00:16:23,590 --> 00:16:27,008
And now I'm gonna hear it
from Jenny.

391
00:16:27,010 --> 00:16:29,010
Everyone stop.

392
00:16:29,012 --> 00:16:30,261
This was a stupid idea.

393
00:16:30,263 --> 00:16:32,547
Negative reinforcement
isn't working.

394
00:16:32,549 --> 00:16:34,382
I think you mean
positive punishment.

395
00:16:34,384 --> 00:16:37,835
Negative reinforcement is the
removal of a positive stimulus.

396
00:16:37,837 --> 00:16:39,220
It's a common mistake.

397
00:16:39,222 --> 00:16:41,472
Negative reinforcement
is really wrong?

398
00:16:41,474 --> 00:16:43,224
Oh, it's used incorrectly
all the time.

399
00:16:43,226 --> 00:16:45,026
Even Bill Murray
makes that mistake

400
00:16:45,028 --> 00:16:47,045
in the first scene
of<i> Ghostbusters.</i>

401
00:16:47,047 --> 00:16:50,682
No way. Not Bill Murray.

402
00:16:50,684 --> 00:16:53,234
I'm studying the effect
of negative reinforcement

403
00:16:53,236 --> 00:16:55,153
on ESP ability.

404
00:16:55,155 --> 00:16:56,237
Huh.

405
00:16:56,239 --> 00:16:59,407
Bill Murray did get it wrong.

406
00:16:59,409 --> 00:17:01,209
Jump ahead to the Stay Puft
Marshmallow Man.

407
00:17:01,211 --> 00:17:02,910
No!

408
00:17:02,912 --> 00:17:04,879
Leonard's right.

409
00:17:04,881 --> 00:17:06,414
We can't just jump ahead.

410
00:17:06,416 --> 00:17:09,083
We have to watch the whole movie.
Look.

411
00:17:09,085 --> 00:17:11,219
We keep procrastinating.

412
00:17:11,221 --> 00:17:13,054
We saw<i> Back to the Future II,</i>

413
00:17:13,056 --> 00:17:14,205
pigeons playing
ping-pong,

414
00:17:14,207 --> 00:17:15,757
a bunch of countries
that look like genitals

415
00:17:15,759 --> 00:17:18,760
and one guy whose genitals
look like Denmark!

416
00:17:19,929 --> 00:17:22,830
Yeah, sorry for
clicking on that.

417
00:17:24,651 --> 00:17:26,401
It's late.
We've wasted hours.

418
00:17:26,403 --> 00:17:28,186
Can we please find it
in ourselves

419
00:17:28,188 --> 00:17:29,987
to do any amount of work
tonight?

420
00:17:29,989 --> 00:17:33,574
But we didn't see them bust
one ghost.

421
00:17:35,078 --> 00:17:37,745
So y-you're saying
we should stand here

422
00:17:37,747 --> 00:17:39,580
in my lab on a
Saturday night

423
00:17:39,582 --> 00:17:40,782
and watch the rest
of<i> Ghostbusters</i>

424
00:17:40,784 --> 00:17:42,450
on a crappy laptop?

425
00:17:42,452 --> 00:17:43,918
No.

426
00:17:54,064 --> 00:17:56,431
It really does hold up.

427
00:18:05,225 --> 00:18:08,643
See? Isn't this better
than a hotel room?

428
00:18:08,645 --> 00:18:11,646
Yep. Shake that thing!

429
00:18:11,648 --> 00:18:15,933
Have you ever seen a body
so fine?

430
00:18:15,935 --> 00:18:18,619
We had some pretty hot corpses
in my anatomy class,

431
00:18:18,621 --> 00:18:21,122
but none of them
moved like that!

432
00:18:35,968 --> 00:18:38,505
Good morning.

433
00:18:38,506 --> 00:18:40,139
You want to go
to the pool?

434
00:18:42,510 --> 00:18:45,511
Come on...
you said it yourself.

435
00:18:45,513 --> 00:18:48,380
Only nerds and losers
stay in the room.

436
00:18:48,382 --> 00:18:51,633
Oh! Oh!
Oh!

437
00:18:51,635 --> 00:18:53,352
Wow, it's bright out.

438
00:18:53,354 --> 00:18:56,021
Isn't it bright? I should
probably close these curtains.

439
00:18:56,023 --> 00:18:57,639
Nah. Bye!

440
00:18:58,726 --> 00:19:01,593
Would you please close
the drapes?

441
00:19:01,595 --> 00:19:02,895
Okay.
