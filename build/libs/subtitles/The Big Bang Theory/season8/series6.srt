1
00:00:02,881 --> 00:00:04,147
I like your suit.

2
00:00:04,149 --> 00:00:06,700
Oh, thanks. Got a couple
new outfits for work.

3
00:00:06,702 --> 00:00:08,652
How does it feel knowing
your fianc?e's job

4
00:00:08,654 --> 00:00:10,787
is to go out
and flirt with doctors,

5
00:00:10,789 --> 00:00:13,490
looking like that,
while you sit here, you know...

6
00:00:13,492 --> 00:00:15,542
looking like this?

7
00:00:15,544 --> 00:00:18,161
She doesn't flirt
with doctors.

8
00:00:18,163 --> 00:00:20,297
Yeah. It's all
very professional.

9
00:00:20,299 --> 00:00:22,416
You know when you bend over,
I can see down your shirt?

10
00:00:22,418 --> 00:00:24,217
Okay, good.

11
00:00:24,219 --> 00:00:26,803
Speaking of new careers,
how are things going

12
00:00:26,805 --> 00:00:28,755
with dark matter,
Sheldon?

13
00:00:28,757 --> 00:00:31,425
Oh, yeah, I'd have to say
it's the most exiting time

14
00:00:31,427 --> 00:00:33,260
in the history of the field.
Oh.

15
00:00:33,262 --> 00:00:34,262
What's going on?

16
00:00:34,263 --> 00:00:36,813
I started doing it.

17
00:00:36,815 --> 00:00:38,015
You know, the government funded

18
00:00:38,017 --> 00:00:40,767
the biggest experiment yet
to detect dark matter.

19
00:00:40,769 --> 00:00:42,152
Oh, yeah,

20
00:00:42,154 --> 00:00:44,438
I've read about that--
they're sending research teams

21
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:46,940
down into abandoned salt mines.
You know, Sheldon,

22
00:00:46,942 --> 00:00:49,076
if we apply to be
one of those teams,

23
00:00:49,078 --> 00:00:51,578
we could be on the ground floor
of something big--

24
00:00:51,580 --> 00:00:54,197
not just for theoretical physics
but for astrophysics as well.

25
00:00:54,199 --> 00:00:57,250
Wait, hang on-- you guys
are gonna work in a mine?

26
00:00:57,252 --> 00:00:58,452
Why not?
You had

27
00:00:58,454 --> 00:01:01,338
a panic attack when
we went through the car wash.

28
00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:04,291
Perhaps the emotion
you're referring to was shock

29
00:01:04,293 --> 00:01:06,877
at you having something cleaned.

30
00:01:07,930 --> 00:01:10,163
I think what Penny meant is,
the thought of you two

31
00:01:10,165 --> 00:01:13,934
in a mine is kind of funny--
it's like a cat riding a Roomba.

32
00:01:15,003 --> 00:01:16,470
If they get scared,
they'll have those hats

33
00:01:16,472 --> 00:01:18,138
with the lights on them,
'cause down there

34
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:20,974
it's night-night all the time!

35
00:01:20,976 --> 00:01:22,075
Maybe they could

36
00:01:22,077 --> 00:01:24,111
ride around in one of
those mine carts that go,

37
00:01:24,113 --> 00:01:26,696
ee-oo-ee-oo-ee-oo.

38
00:01:26,698 --> 00:01:30,817
Yeah, it'll help them get away
when they see a gh-gh-ghost...!

39
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:34,237
Are they making fun of us?
Yup.

40
00:01:34,239 --> 00:01:37,157
I miss the old days
when I couldn't tell.

41
00:01:38,210 --> 00:01:41,628
? Our whole universe
was in a hot, dense state ?

42
00:01:41,630 --> 00:01:44,965
? Then nearly 14 billion years
ago expansion started... Wait! ?

43
00:01:44,967 --> 00:01:46,550
? The Earth began to cool ?

44
00:01:46,552 --> 00:01:49,102
? The autotrophs began to drool,
Neanderthals developed tools ?

45
00:01:49,104 --> 00:01:51,755
? We built the Wall ?
?<i> We built the pyramids</i> ?

46
00:01:51,757 --> 00:01:54,458
? Math, Science, History,
unraveling the mystery ?

47
00:01:54,460 --> 00:01:56,309
? That all started
with a big bang ?

48
00:01:56,311 --> 00:01:56,851
?<i> Bang!</i> ?

49
00:01:56,852 --> 00:02:00,852

51
00:02:06,854 --> 00:02:09,355
So, one of my favorite
video games of all time

52
00:02:09,357 --> 00:02:11,874
is called Shadow of the Colossus,
and it was only

53
00:02:11,876 --> 00:02:13,109
for PlayStation 2,

54
00:02:13,111 --> 00:02:15,027
but then they came out
with a new version

55
00:02:15,029 --> 00:02:16,329
for PS3 with better graphics.

56
00:02:16,331 --> 00:02:18,114
I finally got the chance
to play it,

57
00:02:18,116 --> 00:02:21,651
and for some reason, it just
wasn't as good as the first one.

58
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:28,708
Or something about yoga.

59
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:31,677
I'm sorry--
I was thinking about work.

60
00:02:31,679 --> 00:02:34,096
Well, I was just saying that
there was this video game...

61
00:02:34,098 --> 00:02:36,632
Yeah, that's when I started
thinking about work.

62
00:02:36,634 --> 00:02:39,101
Uh, listen, I've got
some good news.

63
00:02:39,103 --> 00:02:41,103
Hmm.

64
00:02:41,105 --> 00:02:42,722
This is for you.

65
00:02:42,724 --> 00:02:44,390
Huh.

66
00:02:47,061 --> 00:02:48,828
What is this?

67
00:02:48,830 --> 00:02:50,763
Well, you know how
they gave me the company car?

68
00:02:50,765 --> 00:02:53,065
Didn't make sense to have two,
so I sold the other one.

69
00:02:53,067 --> 00:02:54,817
The one I gave you?

70
00:02:54,819 --> 00:02:57,370
Yeah. And there's your money
back-- and now we're even.

71
00:02:57,372 --> 00:02:59,705
How great is that?

72
00:02:59,707 --> 00:03:01,907
Uh, yeah.

73
00:03:01,909 --> 00:03:03,709
What?

74
00:03:03,711 --> 00:03:05,711
Nothing.

75
00:03:05,713 --> 00:03:08,464
Oh, come on, Leonard, I know
the car was a thoughtful gesture

76
00:03:08,466 --> 00:03:09,715
and I really appreciate it,

77
00:03:09,717 --> 00:03:11,550
but it doesn't make sense
to have both.

78
00:03:11,552 --> 00:03:13,469
You're right.
What should I have done?

79
00:03:13,471 --> 00:03:16,922
Taken a picture of us in the car
and put it in a pink frame

80
00:03:16,924 --> 00:03:21,277
with puffy paint around it
that says “best fianc? ever”?

81
00:03:22,730 --> 00:03:24,930
Doesn't sound that bad.

82
00:03:24,932 --> 00:03:27,266
Well, good, because...
that's why I did!

83
00:03:27,268 --> 00:03:28,517
Aw...

84
00:03:29,854 --> 00:03:31,387
Oh...

85
00:03:31,389 --> 00:03:32,438
thank you.

86
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:33,989
That-that is so sweet.
No, it's not

87
00:03:33,991 --> 00:03:35,775
that sweet--
I paid for the frame

88
00:03:35,777 --> 00:03:38,027
with your money
and then got a massage.

89
00:03:38,029 --> 00:03:41,447
You know what, you don't
have to give me this.

90
00:03:41,449 --> 00:03:42,748
You keep it.

91
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:43,949
Why?
The car

92
00:03:43,951 --> 00:03:45,568
was a gift-- it was something
you needed.

93
00:03:45,570 --> 00:03:47,002
I was happy to
help you out.

94
00:03:47,004 --> 00:03:49,839
And I really appreciate it,
but now I<i> don't</i> need it,

95
00:03:49,841 --> 00:03:52,091
so... here you go.
Well,

96
00:03:52,093 --> 00:03:53,876
this is silly-- so you
don't need the car,

97
00:03:53,878 --> 00:03:55,761
but you could use it to buy
yourself something else,

98
00:03:55,763 --> 00:03:59,999
like a... new purse to
put all this money in.

99
00:04:00,001 --> 00:04:01,384
Sweetie, I can buy my own stuff.

100
00:04:01,386 --> 00:04:02,768
I have a good job now.

101
00:04:02,770 --> 00:04:04,236
I know, and I'm
proud of you,

102
00:04:04,238 --> 00:04:06,105
but that doesn't mean I
can't do something nice.

103
00:04:06,107 --> 00:04:09,108
Like this.

104
00:04:09,110 --> 00:04:11,143
Okay, I don't want this
to turn into a fight.

105
00:04:11,145 --> 00:04:12,278
I don't, either.
Great.

106
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:14,230
Thank you.

107
00:04:16,868 --> 00:04:18,984
Can you pass the salt, please?
Sure.

108
00:04:25,076 --> 00:04:28,110
In my mind, that broke
the tension with comedy

109
00:04:28,112 --> 00:04:30,079
and led to sex.

110
00:04:35,169 --> 00:04:37,286
Hey, Sheldon, you busy?

111
00:04:37,288 --> 00:04:39,171
I'm always busy.

112
00:04:39,173 --> 00:04:42,508
This mind is capable
of advanced multitasking.

113
00:04:42,510 --> 00:04:43,476
You know, currently,

114
00:04:43,478 --> 00:04:44,810
I'm attempting to solve

115
00:04:44,812 --> 00:04:46,011
the Penrose conjecture,

116
00:04:46,013 --> 00:04:48,647
I'm composing
my Nobel acceptance speech

117
00:04:48,649 --> 00:04:51,150
for when I've solved
the Penrose conjecture,

118
00:04:51,152 --> 00:04:54,370
and I'm wondering
how mermaids have babies.

119
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:58,357
Don't they lay eggs on a rock?

120
00:04:59,577 --> 00:05:01,994
Now I've got room
for another thing.

121
00:05:01,996 --> 00:05:03,446
What do you want?

122
00:05:03,448 --> 00:05:06,165
So, I did a little
research on what

123
00:05:06,167 --> 00:05:08,000
the conditions are like
in the mines,

124
00:05:08,002 --> 00:05:09,502
and the guys might be right--

125
00:05:09,504 --> 00:05:10,870
sounds pretty rough
down there.

126
00:05:10,872 --> 00:05:12,838
For starters, it's very humid,

127
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:14,623
and about a hundred degrees.

128
00:05:14,625 --> 00:05:17,460
Well, I'm from Texas
and you're from India--

129
00:05:17,462 --> 00:05:21,597
we're no strangers
to the fragrant armpit. Next.

130
00:05:21,599 --> 00:05:25,284
It's also a live mine, so
there'll be dynamite explosions

131
00:05:25,286 --> 00:05:27,553
going off in the distance.
Yeah, I have

132
00:05:27,555 --> 00:05:29,388
a lactose-intolerant roommate

133
00:05:29,390 --> 00:05:32,441
with a taste
for ice cream. Next.

134
00:05:32,443 --> 00:05:35,394
Oh, you have to be down there
for 12 hours at a time.

135
00:05:35,396 --> 00:05:38,147
Yeah? We have to be somewhere.

136
00:05:38,149 --> 00:05:39,315
Well, there's no toilets--

137
00:05:39,317 --> 00:05:41,066
we'll have to do our business
in a bucket.

138
00:05:41,068 --> 00:05:44,153
So it's settled--
we're not doing it.

139
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:48,374
Look, I get it, but...
before we pass up

140
00:05:48,376 --> 00:05:51,026
on an incredible opportunity,
I was thinking about

141
00:05:51,028 --> 00:05:53,212
when Howard was training
to go to space,

142
00:05:53,214 --> 00:05:55,164
they put him
in a simulated environment.

143
00:05:55,166 --> 00:05:58,467
Interesting. You're
suggesting that we recreate

144
00:05:58,469 --> 00:06:00,302
the conditions
of the mine

145
00:06:00,304 --> 00:06:02,721
to see if we can handle it.
Exactly.

146
00:06:02,723 --> 00:06:04,757
Very well.
So where should we do it?

147
00:06:04,759 --> 00:06:08,093
Well, I'll just Google
“hot, dark and moist,”

148
00:06:08,095 --> 00:06:11,263
see what comes up.

149
00:06:12,099 --> 00:06:13,482
Uh, Sheldon...

150
00:06:13,484 --> 00:06:16,452
Oh, there, well, look,
there's all kinds of videos.

151
00:06:20,074 --> 00:06:21,440
Hey, you got a sec?

152
00:06:21,442 --> 00:06:22,775
Hi. Sure.

153
00:06:22,777 --> 00:06:24,493
I was hoping we could talk
about the money again.

154
00:06:24,495 --> 00:06:27,279
Oh, sweetie, just forget about it.
No, no, no, no,

155
00:06:27,281 --> 00:06:29,949
hear me out. I know things
got a little weird last night.

156
00:06:29,951 --> 00:06:33,202
Well, leaving an envelope full
of cash on my dresser after sex

157
00:06:33,204 --> 00:06:35,838
would count as weird.

158
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:39,208
Well, I think I came up
with a pretty good solution.

159
00:06:39,210 --> 00:06:39,916
Mm.

160
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:42,070
Why don't we just put the money
in a joint account?

161
00:06:42,179 --> 00:06:43,846
It'll be our first
money together.

162
00:06:43,848 --> 00:06:46,098
We can use it for the wedding,
the honeymoon, whatever.

163
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:48,050
You know what, that's great.
I love that!

164
00:06:48,052 --> 00:06:51,937
Yeah, of course you do--
I'm not just a genius in bed.

165
00:06:59,146 --> 00:07:02,481
You sure are, baby.

166
00:07:03,317 --> 00:07:05,818
You two want to be alone?

167
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:08,704
I want you to know I get
why you don't want the money--

168
00:07:08,706 --> 00:07:10,406
you've got this new job,
you're excited

169
00:07:10,408 --> 00:07:12,074
about being financially
independent--

170
00:07:12,076 --> 00:07:14,126
and I am nothing
but proud of you.

171
00:07:14,128 --> 00:07:15,494
Oh, thank you so much.

172
00:07:15,496 --> 00:07:17,580
It feels so good
to hear you say that.

173
00:07:17,582 --> 00:07:18,797
And I want you
to know

174
00:07:18,799 --> 00:07:20,666
that I get this job
kind of changes

175
00:07:20,668 --> 00:07:22,167
the balance in our relationship,

176
00:07:22,169 --> 00:07:24,587
and... I'm trying
to be sensitive to that.

177
00:07:26,591 --> 00:07:29,008
What?

178
00:07:29,010 --> 00:07:31,510
Well, I just think that
maybe you're a little hung up

179
00:07:31,512 --> 00:07:34,063
on the money because
I'm less reliant on you now,

180
00:07:34,065 --> 00:07:35,514
and that's a little scary.

181
00:07:36,350 --> 00:07:38,684
Hmm.

182
00:07:38,686 --> 00:07:40,369
Maybe.

183
00:07:41,522 --> 00:07:44,690
<i>Or</i> maybe I tried
to do something nice

184
00:07:44,692 --> 00:07:47,159
and maybe you had
a problem with it

185
00:07:47,161 --> 00:07:49,878
because of your control issues.

186
00:07:51,382 --> 00:07:53,282
Control issues?

187
00:07:53,284 --> 00:07:56,035
Maybe.

188
00:07:56,037 --> 00:07:58,337
<i>Or...</i> maybe...

189
00:07:58,339 --> 00:08:00,539
now that I'm no longer
an out-of-work actress

190
00:08:00,541 --> 00:08:02,591
who can't pay
for her own dinner,

191
00:08:02,593 --> 00:08:04,710
that makes you
a little insecure.

192
00:08:04,712 --> 00:08:06,312
Well, I can't believe
you'd say that.

193
00:08:06,314 --> 00:08:10,065
You know how insecure I am
about my insecurities.

194
00:08:11,552 --> 00:08:13,135
You know what?
I'm sorry.

195
00:08:13,137 --> 00:08:14,970
It's stupid
to fight over money.

196
00:08:14,972 --> 00:08:17,039
Yeah, I'm sorry, too.
We're about to share

197
00:08:17,041 --> 00:08:18,474
the rest of our lives together.

198
00:08:18,476 --> 00:08:20,776
It's<i> our</i> money--
who cares who has it?

199
00:08:20,778 --> 00:08:23,646
Ugh! You're right--
who cares? Mm.

200
00:08:24,482 --> 00:08:26,615
Get that money
out of my back pocket

201
00:08:26,617 --> 00:08:28,984
or I will break your fingers.

202
00:08:31,072 --> 00:08:33,072
Huh. All this time
I never knew

203
00:08:33,074 --> 00:08:34,740
there were steam tunnels
down here.

204
00:08:34,742 --> 00:08:36,625
Most universities
have them.

205
00:08:36,627 --> 00:08:39,411
When I was an undergrad,
I spent three days in one

206
00:08:39,413 --> 00:08:40,829
pledging a sorority.

207
00:08:41,716 --> 00:08:43,732
Did you get in?

208
00:08:43,734 --> 00:08:45,250
No. They forgot I was there.

209
00:08:45,252 --> 00:08:47,720
But it really opened up
my pores.

210
00:08:49,006 --> 00:08:50,589
Well, according
to my research,

211
00:08:50,591 --> 00:08:53,559
the steam tunnels
below this access point

212
00:08:53,561 --> 00:08:56,812
should be the closest
analog to the mines.

213
00:08:56,814 --> 00:08:58,230
This is gonna be
so much more accurate

214
00:08:58,232 --> 00:08:59,348
than the steam room at the gym.

215
00:08:59,350 --> 00:09:00,599
Plus, there's almost no chance

216
00:09:00,601 --> 00:09:03,318
we'll see any
of our coworkers half naked.

217
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:06,572
Or totally naked.
I love Howard,

218
00:09:06,574 --> 00:09:08,691
but the dude needs
a little shame.

219
00:09:08,693 --> 00:09:12,111
All right, Amy, this
walkie-talkie is yours.

220
00:09:12,113 --> 00:09:14,613
If we run into any problems,
I'll contact you.

221
00:09:14,615 --> 00:09:16,782
And if anything bad happens,
what's the rule?

222
00:09:16,784 --> 00:09:20,369
Save you first; come back
for Raj only if there's time.

223
00:09:20,371 --> 00:09:22,955
We're going
to be fine.

224
00:09:22,957 --> 00:09:24,957
Sheldon, I'm really impressed

225
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:26,709
you're willing to try this.

226
00:09:26,711 --> 00:09:28,460
Well, admittedly,
this brushes up

227
00:09:28,462 --> 00:09:31,847
against my well-known aversions
to heat, small places,

228
00:09:31,849 --> 00:09:33,432
going below floor-level,

229
00:09:33,434 --> 00:09:35,801
dampness, hatches,
ladders,

230
00:09:35,803 --> 00:09:37,686
darkness, echoes,

231
00:09:37,688 --> 00:09:41,106
and eliminating in
Home Depot buckets.

232
00:09:41,108 --> 00:09:43,809
That last one is quite new,
but I have a feeling

233
00:09:43,811 --> 00:09:46,228
that's gonna rocket
to the top of the list.

234
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:54,074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

235
00:09:59,096 --> 00:10:03,015
I'm sweating already.

236
00:10:03,017 --> 00:10:08,103
Yeah, as the person beneath you,
allow me to say, I know.

237
00:10:11,142 --> 00:10:12,975
How hot is it?

238
00:10:12,977 --> 00:10:15,644
Uh, let's see.
704?

239
00:10:15,646 --> 00:10:18,063
No, wait, it's on “clock.”

240
00:10:18,065 --> 00:10:20,482
No, the real answer
isn't much better.

241
00:10:20,484 --> 00:10:22,651
102 degrees.

242
00:10:22,653 --> 00:10:23,986
Well, that's what we wanted.

243
00:10:23,988 --> 00:10:25,701
This is as hot
as the mines will be.

244
00:10:25,725 --> 00:10:26,741
True.

245
00:10:26,741 --> 00:10:31,827
Sheldon's Mine Simulation Log,
entry one.

246
00:10:31,829 --> 00:10:34,496
Koothrappali's restating
of the obvious

247
00:10:34,498 --> 00:10:37,249
is already getting on my nerves.

248
00:10:39,670 --> 00:10:41,303
Thanks again
for having us.

249
00:10:41,305 --> 00:10:43,973
Oh, of course. What did
you guys want to talk about?

250
00:10:43,975 --> 00:10:45,975
Well, you know, now
that we're engaged,

251
00:10:45,977 --> 00:10:49,478
we had some questions about how
you handle money as a couple.

252
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:53,015
I told you they weren't gonna
ask us to swing with them.

253
00:10:55,186 --> 00:10:56,518
I didn't think
they were going to.

254
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:58,103
I just wanted to have
a way to say no

255
00:10:58,105 --> 00:11:00,155
without hurting
Leonard's feelings.

256
00:11:01,192 --> 00:11:04,026
Well... nailed it.

257
00:11:04,028 --> 00:11:05,527
So what did you
want to know?

258
00:11:05,529 --> 00:11:08,580
Well, do you guys ever
fight over money?

259
00:11:08,582 --> 00:11:10,082
Sure, sometimes.

260
00:11:10,084 --> 00:11:11,250
I mean, it can be
a little awkward

261
00:11:11,252 --> 00:11:13,869
since I make so much more money
than Howie.

262
00:11:14,755 --> 00:11:17,956
You didn't have to say
“so much more.”

263
00:11:17,958 --> 00:11:19,541
Well, I didn't have to,
but for the sake of accuracy

264
00:11:19,543 --> 00:11:21,677
I felt that I should.

265
00:11:22,513 --> 00:11:24,179
I brought a lot of
significant assets

266
00:11:24,181 --> 00:11:25,748
into the
relationship, too.

267
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:29,885
Like what? Your incomplete set
of<i> Star Trek</i> collector plates?

268
00:11:30,988 --> 00:11:32,204
For your information,
I just bought the last one

269
00:11:32,206 --> 00:11:34,523
I needed on eBay.

270
00:11:34,525 --> 00:11:36,208
Without asking me?

271
00:11:36,210 --> 00:11:39,294
There were only three minutes
left in the auction

272
00:11:39,296 --> 00:11:43,649
and it was a mint condition
Scotty from a smoke-free home.

273
00:11:45,903 --> 00:11:46,869
How much, Howie?

274
00:11:46,871 --> 00:11:47,820
Not a lot.

275
00:11:47,822 --> 00:11:49,722
How much?

276
00:11:49,724 --> 00:11:52,908
Let's not talk about this
in front of our friends.

277
00:11:52,910 --> 00:11:56,412
Was it more or less
than falconry school?

278
00:11:58,165 --> 00:12:02,768
For the tenth time,
that was a Groupon.

279
00:12:03,587 --> 00:12:05,771
Like I would swing
with him.

280
00:12:10,261 --> 00:12:12,144
How you feeling?

281
00:12:12,146 --> 00:12:13,579
Good.

282
00:12:13,581 --> 00:12:16,432
Little claustrophobic.

283
00:12:16,434 --> 00:12:17,816
Let's set up
the equipment.

284
00:12:17,818 --> 00:12:20,102
It'll help take
your mind off of it.

285
00:12:20,104 --> 00:12:24,156
Miners often sang mining songs
to keep their spirits up.

286
00:12:24,158 --> 00:12:25,908
Do you know any
mining songs?

287
00:12:25,910 --> 00:12:27,943
Just the hits.

288
00:12:27,945 --> 00:12:31,613
? Where it's dark
as a dungeon ?

289
00:12:31,615 --> 00:12:34,032
? And it's damp
as the dew ?

290
00:12:34,034 --> 00:12:35,117
That's pretty.

291
00:12:35,119 --> 00:12:37,453
? Where the dangers
are double ?

292
00:12:37,455 --> 00:12:40,589
? And the pleasures
are few ?

293
00:12:40,591 --> 00:12:43,342
? Where the rain never falls ?

294
00:12:43,344 --> 00:12:46,044
? And the sun never shines ?

295
00:12:46,046 --> 00:12:48,964
? Yes, it's dark as a dungeon ?

296
00:12:48,966 --> 00:12:50,966
? Way down
in the mine ?

297
00:12:50,968 --> 00:12:53,135
It's a little more
bleak than I thought.

298
00:12:53,137 --> 00:12:55,721
? Well, I pray
when I dead ?

299
00:12:55,723 --> 00:12:58,524
? And the ages shall roll ?

300
00:12:58,526 --> 00:13:01,193
? That my body will blacken ?

301
00:13:01,195 --> 00:13:03,695
? And turn into coal ?

302
00:13:03,697 --> 00:13:07,032
Getting kind
of grim.

303
00:13:07,034 --> 00:13:09,535
? Then I'll look
from the door ?

304
00:13:09,537 --> 00:13:12,654
? Of my heavenly home ?

305
00:13:12,656 --> 00:13:15,040
? And pity the miner ?

306
00:13:15,042 --> 00:13:18,577
? That mines my poor bones. ?

307
00:13:20,331 --> 00:13:24,633
Okay. How 'bout
a little Miley Cyrus next?

308
00:13:24,635 --> 00:13:26,301
Who's he?

309
00:13:30,007 --> 00:13:32,224
Talk about wasted money.

310
00:13:32,226 --> 00:13:34,560
What about the late fees
on our credit card

311
00:13:34,562 --> 00:13:36,261
because somebody didn't pay
the bill on time?

312
00:13:36,263 --> 00:13:37,563
Well, maybe I would have paid it

313
00:13:37,565 --> 00:13:40,098
if I wasn't also doing
everything else around here.

314
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:42,317
Oh, you're saying I don't do
anything around here.

315
00:13:44,104 --> 00:13:47,406
Look at my chore chart.

316
00:13:47,408 --> 00:13:50,859
She made him a chore chart.
I see it.

317
00:13:50,861 --> 00:13:54,363
“Do the dishes.”
There's a star right there.

318
00:13:54,365 --> 00:13:57,366
That was a pity star. Putting
water in the roasting pan

319
00:13:57,368 --> 00:14:00,335
and leaving it in the sink
is not doing the dishes.

320
00:14:00,337 --> 00:14:04,540
That pan had to soak
and you know it.

321
00:14:04,542 --> 00:14:06,625
Well, don't come crying to me

322
00:14:06,627 --> 00:14:08,343
when you don't get
your allowance.

323
00:14:09,213 --> 00:14:10,262
It's not an allowance.

324
00:14:10,264 --> 00:14:11,547
It's a stipend!

325
00:14:11,549 --> 00:14:13,465
And we said we weren't gonna
call it an allowance

326
00:14:13,467 --> 00:14:14,800
in front of my friends.

327
00:14:18,889 --> 00:14:21,723
I usually don't like
lemon bars,

328
00:14:21,725 --> 00:14:24,226
but Th-these are really good.

329
00:14:26,363 --> 00:14:30,232
So, as Hannah
Montana, Miley

330
00:14:30,234 --> 00:14:31,817
was a world-famous pop star.

331
00:14:31,819 --> 00:14:33,819
But then she would take off
her wig and go to school

332
00:14:33,821 --> 00:14:35,037
like a
normal girl.

333
00:14:35,039 --> 00:14:36,071
Which, I don't have to tell you,

334
00:14:36,073 --> 00:14:39,074
at that age,
is its own headache.

335
00:14:39,076 --> 00:14:41,376
That's preposterous.

336
00:14:41,378 --> 00:14:44,496
How would she go unrecognized
just by wearing a wig?

337
00:14:44,498 --> 00:14:46,582
But you're okay with Superman
concealing his identity

338
00:14:46,584 --> 00:14:47,833
with a pair of glasses?

339
00:14:47,835 --> 00:14:49,751
He doesn't just put on a pair
of glasses.

340
00:14:49,753 --> 00:14:51,386
He combs back his curlicue

341
00:14:51,388 --> 00:14:54,556
and affects
a mild-mannered personality.

342
00:14:54,558 --> 00:14:56,925
You guys doing
okay down there?

343
00:14:56,927 --> 00:14:59,978
I told you to use
the walkie-talkie!

344
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:04,433
You guys doing okay down there?

345
00:15:04,435 --> 00:15:09,021
Please keep this channel clear
for emergencies. Thank you.

346
00:15:09,023 --> 00:15:12,741
I'm going to the vending
machine. Do you want anything?

347
00:15:12,743 --> 00:15:15,360
This is a simulation.
We have to survive

348
00:15:15,362 --> 00:15:16,695
on the supplies we brought.

349
00:15:16,697 --> 00:15:19,281
Okay, just checking.

350
00:15:19,283 --> 00:15:22,251
We should have asked her
to get some Funyuns.

351
00:15:22,253 --> 00:15:24,169
You're not going to have Funyuns

352
00:15:24,171 --> 00:15:26,505
when we're a mile
below the surface of the Earth.

353
00:15:26,507 --> 00:15:28,290
What if we brought them down
with us?

354
00:15:29,126 --> 00:15:31,793
We'll take some Funyuns.

355
00:15:31,795 --> 00:15:33,795
Anything else?

356
00:15:33,797 --> 00:15:36,465
Some York Peppermint Patties,

357
00:15:36,467 --> 00:15:38,133
a couple
of Dr. Peppers, and...

358
00:15:38,135 --> 00:15:40,886
run to Best Buy and see if
they have a portable DVD player

359
00:15:40,888 --> 00:15:44,523
and season one of a show
called<i> Hannah Montana.</i>

360
00:15:44,525 --> 00:15:46,892
Have her get season two.

361
00:15:46,894 --> 00:15:49,811
Season one,
it was still finding itself.

362
00:15:50,898 --> 00:15:53,315
Sorry you guys had to see that.
Oh,

363
00:15:53,317 --> 00:15:54,650
don't apologize.
Yeah.

364
00:15:54,652 --> 00:15:58,036
It just makes it a lot harder
to pretend it never happened.

365
00:15:58,038 --> 00:16:00,155
Money's a sensitive subject
for Howie

366
00:16:00,157 --> 00:16:02,124
because of the difference
in our income.

367
00:16:02,126 --> 00:16:03,375
It really bothers him?

368
00:16:03,377 --> 00:16:04,626
Well, sure.
There's still a lot of pressure

369
00:16:04,628 --> 00:16:05,994
on guys to be providers.

370
00:16:05,996 --> 00:16:07,963
So even though
he's happy for me,

371
00:16:07,965 --> 00:16:09,765
it's just a little tough on him.

372
00:16:09,767 --> 00:16:11,466
Uh-oh.
What?

373
00:16:11,468 --> 00:16:12,668
Well,

374
00:16:12,670 --> 00:16:13,835
if I do well in sales,

375
00:16:13,837 --> 00:16:15,671
I could end up making a
lot more money than you.

376
00:16:15,673 --> 00:16:17,673
Not a problem.
I grew up with a mother

377
00:16:17,675 --> 00:16:19,341
who emasculated
my father financially

378
00:16:19,343 --> 00:16:21,760
and in every other aspect
of his life, so...

379
00:16:23,030 --> 00:16:26,181
...really, it's what I think
love looks like.

380
00:16:27,618 --> 00:16:29,985
I'll be right back.
I'm gonna go check on him.

381
00:16:32,239 --> 00:16:33,893
Maybe it's a good
thing we came here.

382
00:16:33,894 --> 00:16:35,930
It's like a lesson
in what not to do.

383
00:16:35,931 --> 00:16:38,694
Yeah I don't want something dumb
like money to come between us.

384
00:16:38,696 --> 00:16:40,862
It won't. Let's just promise
to figure this kind of stuff out

385
00:16:40,864 --> 00:16:41,947
before we get married.

386
00:16:41,949 --> 00:16:44,333
Why are you
being so bossy?!

387
00:16:44,335 --> 00:16:46,234
Why are you
being a baby?

388
00:16:46,236 --> 00:16:48,837
I'm not a baby!
I'm a grown man,

389
00:16:48,839 --> 00:16:52,374
and I made the bed.
Now where's my star?

390
00:16:54,561 --> 00:16:56,595
Should we go?
Hang on.

391
00:16:56,597 --> 00:16:59,348
I want to see if
he gets the star.

392
00:17:01,518 --> 00:17:04,603
Oh, this heat is brutal.

393
00:17:04,605 --> 00:17:07,105
As someone from the tropical
subcontinent of India,

394
00:17:07,107 --> 00:17:09,608
you should know that fanning
yourself in a humid environment

395
00:17:09,610 --> 00:17:12,144
only raises
your body temperature.

396
00:17:12,146 --> 00:17:15,113
Huh. That does explain why
the servants used to look so hot

397
00:17:15,115 --> 00:17:16,865
while they were fanning me.

398
00:17:16,867 --> 00:17:20,619
Let's get our minds off
how uncomfortable we are.

399
00:17:20,621 --> 00:17:22,954
We could take some more
simulated instrument readings.

400
00:17:22,956 --> 00:17:24,239
My major focus

401
00:17:24,241 --> 00:17:26,958
at the moment is keeping
my claustrophobia at bay.

402
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:28,543
How's that going?
You tell me.

403
00:17:28,545 --> 00:17:30,412
I feel like I can't breathe,

404
00:17:30,414 --> 00:17:33,081
and I am tempted
to crack you open

405
00:17:33,083 --> 00:17:36,051
and suck the air
right out of your lungs.

406
00:17:36,970 --> 00:17:39,638
Sheldon, if this is
too much, we can stop.

407
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:40,722
We're not stopping.

408
00:17:40,724 --> 00:17:42,507
You don't have to
bite my head off.

409
00:17:42,509 --> 00:17:44,092
I apologize.

410
00:17:44,094 --> 00:17:45,477
I j...

411
00:17:45,479 --> 00:17:48,397
I'm plagued
by an internal struggle.

412
00:17:48,399 --> 00:17:50,098
If you would just use
the bucket,

413
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:52,567
you'd be
so much more comfortable.

414
00:17:52,569 --> 00:17:55,687
My struggle is emotional.

415
00:17:55,689 --> 00:17:57,439
Oh. Is it Amy?

416
00:17:57,441 --> 00:17:59,608
It's dark matter.

417
00:17:59,610 --> 00:18:01,843
When I entered
the field

418
00:18:01,845 --> 00:18:04,279
of string theory,
I was a prodigy.

419
00:18:04,281 --> 00:18:08,366
I rose to a position of respect,

420
00:18:08,368 --> 00:18:10,752
and I assumed
my career would continue

421
00:18:10,754 --> 00:18:12,821
on that upward trajectory.

422
00:18:12,823 --> 00:18:15,624
Now here I am in my 30s,

423
00:18:15,626 --> 00:18:18,627
I'm back at square one.

424
00:18:18,629 --> 00:18:22,147
And, frankly, it's frightening.

425
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:26,601
Sheldon, you know
what I think of when I'm scared?

426
00:18:26,603 --> 00:18:27,969
<i>Voyager.</i>

427
00:18:27,971 --> 00:18:30,188
<i>Voyager</i> the space probe

428
00:18:30,190 --> 00:18:33,975
or<i> Voyager</i>
the<i> Star Trek</i> TV show?

429
00:18:33,977 --> 00:18:35,444
The space probe.

430
00:18:35,446 --> 00:18:37,062
Good.
Because I am too hot and tired

431
00:18:37,064 --> 00:18:40,315
to go on about how much
I hate<i> Voyager</i> the TV show.

432
00:18:41,535 --> 00:18:43,318
By the time
I was born,

433
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:45,737
<i>Voyager 1's</i> mission
was supposed to be over.

434
00:18:45,739 --> 00:18:46,872
It had seen

435
00:18:46,874 --> 00:18:49,958
Jupiter and Saturn
and all their moons,

436
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:52,327
but it kept going.

437
00:18:53,497 --> 00:18:55,130
When I left India for America,

438
00:18:55,132 --> 00:18:57,799
I was never more scared
in my life.

439
00:18:57,801 --> 00:19:00,168
I had no idea
what lay ahead.

440
00:19:00,170 --> 00:19:02,938
Whenever I feel that way,
I think about how...

441
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:06,842
<i>Voyager</i> is still out there

442
00:19:06,844 --> 00:19:09,478
somewhere
beyond our solar system,

443
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:12,347
going further than anyone
ever thought it could.

444
00:19:15,652 --> 00:19:18,436
Don't leave!
You can do this!

445
00:19:20,274 --> 00:19:22,324
Sheldon,
is everything okay?

446
00:19:22,326 --> 00:19:23,859
It's too late for Koothrappali.

447
00:19:23,861 --> 00:19:24,876
Let's go!

448
00:19:27,331 --> 00:19:31,199
11 minutes.
That's longer than I thought.

449
00:19:32,035 --> 00:19:33,502
They're in my shirt!

450
00:19:44,484 --> 00:19:46,818
Okay, this is definitely
the most fun thing we can do

451
00:19:46,820 --> 00:19:47,986
with the money.

452
00:19:50,824 --> 00:19:54,943
I've never done it on
a big old pile of cash before.

453
00:19:56,947 --> 00:20:01,533
“Me neither, Leonard.
It's my first time, too.”

454
00:20:05,005 --> 00:20:08,123
I'm so sorry I made you feel bad
about the money stuff.

455
00:20:08,125 --> 00:20:11,309
It's okay.
No, it's not okay.

456
00:20:11,311 --> 00:20:13,628
I want us to be
partners, equals.

457
00:20:13,630 --> 00:20:16,381
Adults in a mature
relationship.

458
00:20:16,383 --> 00:20:18,550
I want that, too.

459
00:20:19,937 --> 00:20:22,137
Now, let's talk about
your birthday party.

460
00:20:22,139 --> 00:20:24,639
Ooh, laser tag, laser tag.
Oh!

461
00:20:26,693 --> 00:20:29,060
Do you really need me
to transcribe this?

462
00:20:29,062 --> 00:20:30,362
You're not doing it for me.

463
00:20:30,364 --> 00:20:32,364
You're doing it
for future generations

464
00:20:32,366 --> 00:20:35,033
who will benefit
from my struggle.

465
00:20:36,253 --> 00:20:38,737
Sheldon's Mine Simulation Log,

466
00:20:38,739 --> 00:20:41,239
entry four:

467
00:20:41,241 --> 00:20:45,076
my Kit Kat has melted.

468
00:20:45,078 --> 00:20:48,580
All is lost.

469
00:20:48,582 --> 00:20:51,132
You call yourself
a friend?!

470
00:20:51,134 --> 00:20:52,334
I was trying

471
00:20:52,336 --> 00:20:54,669
to help you!
And at the first sign of trouble

472
00:20:54,671 --> 00:20:59,841
you ran away, leaving me
to fend off a family of rats!

473
00:20:59,843 --> 00:21:02,077
You're a completely selfish
human being

474
00:21:02,079 --> 00:21:05,914
and a... and a physical
and a moral coward!

475
00:21:07,217 --> 00:21:09,317
His statements of the obvious
continue to annoy.
