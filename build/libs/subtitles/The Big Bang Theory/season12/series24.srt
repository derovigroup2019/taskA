1
00:00:01,586 --> 00:00:02,885
Carbon.

2
00:00:05,642 --> 00:00:06,942
Hydrogen.

3
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:10,733
Carbon.

4
00:00:13,115 --> 00:00:14,448
Carbon.

5
00:00:15,565 --> 00:00:16,965
And last but not least,

6
00:00:17,053 --> 00:00:18,253
carbon.

7
00:00:19,867 --> 00:00:21,700
This might be the glue talking,

8
00:00:21,816 --> 00:00:25,223
but that was a very pleasurable
139 and a half hours.

9
00:00:25,311 --> 00:00:26,512
Agreed.

10
00:00:26,801 --> 00:00:28,582
What kind of DNA
is this, anyway?

11
00:00:28,670 --> 00:00:30,697
I was trying to design
the genetic code

12
00:00:30,785 --> 00:00:32,387
of an advanced race
of human being.

13
00:00:32,475 --> 00:00:35,028
- One of my rare failures, actually.
- What went wrong?

14
00:00:35,116 --> 00:00:37,754
The balls kept
sticking to my pants.

15
00:00:38,965 --> 00:00:40,754
Let's just let it dry.

16
00:00:41,356 --> 00:00:42,840
- Hi. - Hello.
- Hey, babe.

17
00:00:42,928 --> 00:00:44,037
- Oh, don't slam the...
- Don't slam the...

18
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:50,371
That was exhilarating.

19
00:00:51,916 --> 00:00:53,606
- You pick up your dresses?
- Yep.

20
00:00:53,694 --> 00:00:55,965
The tailor had to take mine in
and let Penny's out.

21
00:00:56,053 --> 00:00:57,762
Best day of my life.

22
00:00:59,714 --> 00:01:01,678
What about the day
you met me?

23
00:01:01,821 --> 00:01:03,840
I stand by my statement.

24
00:01:04,670 --> 00:01:06,434
Well, thank you guys so much
for the clothes

25
00:01:06,522 --> 00:01:08,007
and the shoes,
the plane tickets.

26
00:01:08,095 --> 00:01:09,106
You've been so generous.

27
00:01:09,194 --> 00:01:10,802
Well, it's important
that all of our friends

28
00:01:10,889 --> 00:01:12,239
get to share
this moment with us.

29
00:01:12,327 --> 00:01:14,254
And then for years to come,
you can tell others

30
00:01:14,342 --> 00:01:15,955
you had a front-row
seat to history.

31
00:01:16,043 --> 00:01:17,048
Although, technically,
I think

32
00:01:17,135 --> 00:01:18,768
your seats are
in the second row.

33
00:01:19,681 --> 00:01:22,401
Do you want to go back to the
apartment and see me try on my dress?

34
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:24,901
Shouldn't I see it for the first
time at the Nobel ceremony?

35
00:01:24,989 --> 00:01:26,456
It's not a wedding.

36
00:01:26,549 --> 00:01:28,024
Okay. Well, give me
a minute to think

37
00:01:28,112 --> 00:01:29,831
of another reason I
don't want to see it.

38
00:01:30,818 --> 00:01:32,908
How about this... you can
practice your acceptance speech

39
00:01:32,995 --> 00:01:33,971
while I try on the dress.

40
00:01:34,059 --> 00:01:37,190
Ah, great. You can help me
whittle it down to 90 minutes.

41
00:01:42,696 --> 00:01:44,909
Was Amy suspicious when
they had to let your dress out?

42
00:01:44,997 --> 00:01:47,854
No. She was so happy,
she didn't even question it.

43
00:01:48,659 --> 00:01:49,891
Someone's gonna
figure it out.

44
00:01:49,979 --> 00:01:50,971
Why don't we just
tell people?

45
00:01:51,059 --> 00:01:52,353
No, it's too early.
I haven't even wrapped

46
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:53,542
- my head around it.
- I have.

47
00:01:53,629 --> 00:01:55,893
- My head is wrapped.
- Yeah, well...

48
00:01:55,981 --> 00:01:57,152
if something else
had been wrapped,

49
00:01:57,239 --> 00:01:58,930
we wouldn't be
in this situation.

50
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:02,133
Excuse me,
but if I recall,

51
00:02:02,221 --> 00:02:03,712
you're the one who went out
drinking with Sheldon,

52
00:02:03,799 --> 00:02:04,980
then came home
and attacked me.

53
00:02:05,067 --> 00:02:07,909
Attacked you?
I think, I said, "Do you wanna?"

54
00:02:08,055 --> 00:02:09,377
Yeah.

55
00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:11,690
- I was helpless.
- Uh-huh.

56
00:02:12,916 --> 00:02:13,916
So...

57
00:02:14,283 --> 00:02:15,822
Do you wanna?

58
00:02:17,142 --> 00:02:19,088
- Well, I can't get more pregnant.
- Mm-hmm.

59
00:02:19,198 --> 00:02:20,705
- We'll see about that.
- Mm-uh.

60
00:02:21,553 --> 00:02:25,213

was in a hot, dense state ?</i>

61
00:02:25,301 --> 00:02:29,047

62
00:02:29,135 --> 00:02:30,346

63
00:02:30,434 --> 00:02:33,352
<i>? The autotrophs began to drool,
Neanderthals developed tools ?</i>

64
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:35,440

- ? We built the pyramids ?</i>

65
00:02:35,635 --> 00:02:38,198
<i>? Math, Science, History,
unraveling the mystery ?</i>

66
00:02:38,286 --> 00:02:40,171
<i>? That all started
with a big bang ?</i>

67

Now, Michael,
Mommy and Daddy

70
00:02:47,692 --> 00:02:49,223
are going away
for a couple days,

71
00:02:49,311 --> 00:02:50,568
so if you're gonna say
your first words,

72
00:02:50,655 --> 00:02:53,262
you got to do it now
or wait till we get back.

73
00:02:56,574 --> 00:02:57,861
Somebody just peed

74
00:02:57,949 --> 00:02:59,113
in the big girl potty.

75
00:02:59,201 --> 00:03:01,371
Oh, I'm so proud!

76
00:03:01,459 --> 00:03:03,113
It was her, right?

77
00:03:03,427 --> 00:03:04,541
Yes.

78
00:03:05,238 --> 00:03:06,754
You still feel good
about leaving them

79
00:03:06,842 --> 00:03:09,387
with Stuart and Denise
for a couple days?

80
00:03:09,490 --> 00:03:12,827
I guess. I just hope we don't
miss Michael's first words.

81
00:03:12,915 --> 00:03:14,897
Or Stuart's last words.

82
00:03:15,923 --> 00:03:17,477
You realize it's been years

83
00:03:17,565 --> 00:03:19,448
since we've got away
just the two of us.

84
00:03:19,536 --> 00:03:21,588
I know. I can't wait.

85
00:03:21,704 --> 00:03:24,895
Fancy hotel room.
The big bed.

86
00:03:24,983 --> 00:03:29,106
Yeah. We're gonna
sleep our asses off.

87
00:03:31,949 --> 00:03:33,106
You really think walking her

88
00:03:33,194 --> 00:03:34,876
is gonna help me meet girls?

00:03:34,964 --> 00:03:36,979

00:03:37,290 --> 00:03:39,105
Good. 'Cause I'm not.

91
00:03:39,949 --> 00:03:41,103
Just remember,

92
00:03:41,191 --> 00:03:42,563
you're in charge.

93
00:03:42,650 --> 00:03:44,746
Don't let her pull<i> you.</i>

94
00:03:45,859 --> 00:03:49,043
That seems like
an unnecessary thing to say.

95
00:03:49,801 --> 00:03:52,658
And please, if you have
any problems, any questions,

96
00:03:52,746 --> 00:03:54,316
call me immediately, okay?

97
00:03:54,404 --> 00:03:55,934
She's my baby.

98
00:03:56,111 --> 00:03:58,168
It shouldn't come up,
but just in case:

99
00:03:58,258 --> 00:04:01,270
where could I buy a dog
that looks exactly like her?

100
00:04:03,304 --> 00:04:06,038
Kidding. If she dies,
I'll just tell you.

101
00:04:08,475 --> 00:04:09,656
Ready?

102
00:04:09,743 --> 00:04:11,109
Oh. Hang on.

103
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:15,598
Go.

Why are you talking so fast?

112
00:04:27,596 --> 00:04:30,071
I'm trying to get my speech
down to 90 minutes.

Nobody's gonna be able to
understand a word you're saying.

Welcome to my life.

115
00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:38,321
I think you need
to do some editing,

116
00:04:38,409 --> 00:04:40,774
like maybe cut out all
that stuff about your childhood.

117
00:04:40,862 --> 00:04:41,943
Are you kidding?

Growing up in the
backwoods of East Texas

119
00:04:44,111 --> 00:04:46,250
is what makes me warm
and relatable.

120
00:04:46,883 --> 00:04:48,727
Well, what about all these pages

121
00:04:48,815 --> 00:04:51,164
calling out everyone
who said you wouldn't succeed?

122
00:04:51,313 --> 00:04:53,436
I told them all
they would rue the day.

123
00:04:53,524 --> 00:04:55,906
How is it gonna make me look
if the day finally comes,

124
00:04:55,994 --> 00:04:57,789
and they're not filled
with rue?

125
00:04:58,383 --> 00:05:00,969
Sheldon, this isn't about ruing.

126
00:05:01,057 --> 00:05:02,308
This is about...

127
00:05:02,396 --> 00:05:04,578
humbly accepting
a great honor.

128
00:05:04,665 --> 00:05:07,772
Amy, we won the Nobel
Prize in Physics.

Humility is for people
who win the goofy Nobels

00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:12,836
like Literature,
Economics and Peace.

00:05:13,985 --> 00:05:16,071
Please tell me that's
not in your speech.

Oh. I can cut it,
but it's the only joke I have.

All right, bagels down.
Before we head to the airport,

134
00:05:25,604 --> 00:05:27,024
I'd like to go over
a few things.

135
00:05:29,071 --> 00:05:31,326
From the moment we
step off the plane,

136
00:05:31,414 --> 00:05:33,607

137
00:05:33,694 --> 00:05:35,024

138
00:05:35,112 --> 00:05:37,795
I told you
these tickets weren't free.

139
00:05:37,965 --> 00:05:41,321
As such, your behavior must
reflect the highest standards.

Uh, Raj. Bagel down.

00:05:44,405 --> 00:05:47,602
If my blood sugar drops
and I get bitchy, it's on you.

142
00:05:48,344 --> 00:05:49,836

kick us off.

175
00:07:07,034 --> 00:07:09,078
to the airport
six hours before boarding.

176
00:07:10,141 --> 00:07:11,891
Excuse me. Hello?
What did we

177
00:07:11,979 --> 00:07:14,327
just learn about the end
of business meetings?

178
00:07:14,415 --> 00:07:15,836
Oh, my God.

179
00:07:18,406 --> 00:07:20,839
Yeah, great.
Whatever. Uh-huh.

180
00:07:22,437 --> 00:07:23,749
Go on.

181
00:07:23,837 --> 00:07:25,437
You first. Go.

182
00:07:27,408 --> 00:07:28,522
Wait.

183
00:07:28,609 --> 00:07:29,790
Help me! Oh.

184
00:07:29,878 --> 00:07:32,261
- Help me!
- Oh, wait. Come here.

185
00:07:32,349 --> 00:07:33,493
- We got this.
- Yeah, get in, get in, get in.

186
00:07:35,783 --> 00:07:37,064
Hang on.

187
00:07:37,151 --> 00:07:38,865
I've-I've got an idea.

188
00:07:44,658 --> 00:07:46,967
Well done.
You know, you're proving to be

189
00:07:47,055 --> 00:07:49,770
an invaluable part
of my entourage.

190
00:07:50,167 --> 00:07:51,367
Cool.

191
00:08:03,545 --> 00:08:04,612
Yeah?

192
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:06,648
- How you doing?
- Fine. Why?

193
00:08:06,835 --> 00:08:09,885
Well, this is the furthest we've
ever been away from the kids.

194
00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:12,562
I was just checking to see
if you're okay.

195
00:08:12,688 --> 00:08:15,620
I'm on my second Jack Reacher.
I'm doing great.

196
00:08:15,798 --> 00:08:16,979
Good. Me, too.

197
00:08:17,067 --> 00:08:18,381
I was just looking
at the map.

198
00:08:18,469 --> 00:08:20,198
Couldn't help
thinking: we're here

199
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:22,753
and they're there, and
if anything happened,

200
00:08:22,841 --> 00:08:26,457
we'd have to go here to get
all the way back there.

201
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:28,144
Why are you trying
to freak me out?

202
00:08:28,281 --> 00:08:29,329
This is our vacation.

203
00:08:29,417 --> 00:08:32,448
I thought we should
do things together.

204
00:08:33,269 --> 00:08:34,800
Howard, the kids are okay.

205
00:08:34,888 --> 00:08:35,862
How do you know that?

206
00:08:35,950 --> 00:08:38,299
I just know.
A mother knows.

207
00:08:38,674 --> 00:08:40,916
So what,
now the Force is with you?

208
00:08:41,413 --> 00:08:42,727
Let's see.

209
00:08:43,157 --> 00:08:46,158
This is not the woman
you want to annoy.

210
00:08:48,255 --> 00:08:50,070
Howard. Howard. What?

211
00:08:50,346 --> 00:08:52,689
You see the woman
sitting next to me?

212
00:08:53,307 --> 00:08:54,611
What about her?

213
00:08:55,049 --> 00:08:56,583
Is this her?

214
00:08:58,057 --> 00:08:59,807
Buffy the Vampire Slayer?

215
00:08:59,907 --> 00:09:01,876
Shh! Be cool.

216
00:09:03,663 --> 00:09:05,811
No, that's not her.
Okay.

217
00:09:06,039 --> 00:09:07,571
How about now?

218
00:09:11,566 --> 00:09:13,232
Uh-oh.

219
00:09:18,907 --> 00:09:21,007
That's the fourth time
she's been to the bathroom

220
00:09:21,095 --> 00:09:22,502
in the last two hours.

221
00:09:23,001 --> 00:09:24,212
So?

222
00:09:24,424 --> 00:09:27,735
Her breakfast was binding.
I made sure of that.

223
00:09:28,853 --> 00:09:30,829
- So?
- So she clearly has

224
00:09:30,917 --> 00:09:32,235
some sort of
stomach distress.

225
00:09:32,323 --> 00:09:34,446
If it's viral, we're
all susceptible.

226
00:09:34,767 --> 00:09:36,483
She's probably just airsick.

227
00:09:36,579 --> 00:09:37,853
Yeah,
but what if she's not?

228
00:09:37,970 --> 00:09:39,351
What if we get
what she has?

229
00:09:39,439 --> 00:09:41,181
What if we infect
the King of Sweden?

230
00:09:41,269 --> 00:09:43,329
That's how wars start.

231
00:09:48,849 --> 00:09:51,696
All right, that's it, this is
<i>Outbreak </i>and she's the monkey.

232
00:09:53,387 --> 00:09:54,626
Wait. Stop.

233
00:09:54,714 --> 00:09:56,243
Be reasonable.

234
00:09:57,558 --> 00:09:59,204
Leonard...

235
00:09:59,337 --> 00:10:01,142
we need to do something
about your wife.

236
00:10:01,230 --> 00:10:02,713
What's the matter?
She is clearly sick,

237
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,307
and she's gonna take
us all down with her.

238
00:10:04,394 --> 00:10:05,741
She's not sick, Sheldon.

239
00:10:05,829 --> 00:10:07,548
She is,
and I'm gonna catch it,

240
00:10:07,636 --> 00:10:09,398
and it's gonna ruin
the greatest day of my life.

241
00:10:09,485 --> 00:10:11,907
I promise you're not going
to get what she has.

242
00:10:11,995 --> 00:10:13,206
What's going on?

243
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:15,084
Unclean! Unclean!

244
00:10:15,446 --> 00:10:16,823
What?

245
00:10:16,962 --> 00:10:18,391
He thinks you're sick.

246
00:10:18,478 --> 00:10:19,793
Oh.

247
00:10:20,267 --> 00:10:21,423
Should we tell him?

248
00:10:21,511 --> 00:10:22,907
Well, if we don't,
he might try

249
00:10:22,995 --> 00:10:24,221
- and jump out of the plane.
- Yeah.

250
00:10:24,308 --> 00:10:25,789
Doesn't answer my question.

251
00:10:26,383 --> 00:10:28,157
Tell me what?

252
00:10:28,436 --> 00:10:31,368
I'm pregnant, Sheldon.

253
00:10:31,915 --> 00:10:34,196
You're right,
I can't catch that.

254
00:10:38,610 --> 00:10:39,900
Good news, Amy.

255
00:10:40,209 --> 00:10:41,676
She's just pregnant.

256
00:10:47,501 --> 00:10:48,868
Are you kidding me?

257
00:10:48,956 --> 00:10:51,839
You just found out that a woman
who has loved and cared for you

258
00:10:51,927 --> 00:10:54,894
for 12 years is pregnant,
and all you can say is

259
00:10:54,982 --> 00:10:57,230
you're relieved that she's
not gonna get you sick?

260
00:10:57,735 --> 00:10:59,420
There's no need
for a recap.

261
00:10:59,508 --> 00:11:00,985
I was there.

262
00:11:02,563 --> 00:11:04,829
- Why didn't you tell me?
- I didn't tell anybody.

263
00:11:04,917 --> 00:11:07,024
I'm not anybody.
I'm your best friend.

264
00:11:07,112 --> 00:11:08,882
What's going on?
She's pregnant.

265
00:11:08,970 --> 00:11:10,852
That's fantastic!

266
00:11:11,016 --> 00:11:12,547
Why didn't you tell me?

267
00:11:13,563 --> 00:11:14,860
She didn't tell
me, either.

268
00:11:14,948 --> 00:11:16,610
But I'm her best friend.

269
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:19,094
We'll get
into that later.

270
00:11:20,165 --> 00:11:22,305
What happened to
"I'm never gonna have kids"?

271
00:11:22,393 --> 00:11:24,913
It was an accident.
I went out drinking with Sheldon.

272
00:11:25,803 --> 00:11:26,911
Oh, my gosh.

273
00:11:27,170 --> 00:11:28,829
We're sister wives?

274
00:11:29,353 --> 00:11:31,899
No. Then I went home
and slept with Leonard.

275
00:11:31,987 --> 00:11:34,196
- While fantasizing about...
- Leonard.

276
00:11:34,617 --> 00:11:36,001
And a little Idris Elba.

277
00:11:36,089 --> 00:11:37,836
- I mean, ah...
- Oh, yeah.

278
00:11:39,319 --> 00:11:40,800
What would you like me to say?

279
00:11:40,888 --> 00:11:42,788
How about congratulating us?

280
00:11:42,876 --> 00:11:44,602
Are congratulations
even in order?

281
00:11:44,690 --> 00:11:46,002
I didn't think
Penny wanted children.

282
00:11:46,089 --> 00:11:48,704
Well, she didn't, now she
does. And just so you know,

283
00:11:48,792 --> 00:11:49,841
we weren't gonna tell anybody

284
00:11:49,928 --> 00:11:51,657
so we wouldn't
upstage your big day.

285
00:11:51,745 --> 00:11:53,901
Oh, please,
you couldn't upstage us.

286
00:11:53,989 --> 00:11:55,204
We won a Nobel Prize.

287
00:11:55,292 --> 00:11:56,973
Any idiot can have a baby.

288
00:11:57,177 --> 00:11:58,625
Hey. What's going on?

289
00:11:58,821 --> 00:12:00,524
Case in point.

290
00:12:01,954 --> 00:12:04,102
You are a selfish jerk.

291
00:12:04,192 --> 00:12:06,290
To hell with you and
your Nobel Prize.

292
00:12:08,522 --> 00:12:10,303
I found her boarding pass
in her purse.

293
00:12:10,390 --> 00:12:11,829
It's totally her.

294
00:12:15,495 --> 00:12:17,086
Hi, Stuart, just checking in.

295
00:12:17,174 --> 00:12:18,395
Seeing if everything's okay.

296
00:12:18,483 --> 00:12:20,887
<i>Oh, yeah, we're having fun.</i>

297
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:24,817
<i>Me, Halley and Denise
played hide-and-seek all day.</i>

298
00:12:24,905 --> 00:12:27,133
- Oh, that's nice.
<i>- Yeah.</i>

299
00:12:27,374 --> 00:12:29,774
<i>I found Denise right away.</i>

300
00:12:31,297 --> 00:12:32,758
Where was Halley hiding?

301
00:12:32,846 --> 00:12:36,680
<i>Uh, the important thing
is she's not there now.</i>

302
00:12:37,359 --> 00:12:39,437
Okay, so, everyone's
happy and healthy?

303
00:12:39,525 --> 00:12:40,922
<i>Well, that depends.</i>

304
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:42,091
What's that mean?

305
00:12:42,239 --> 00:12:44,370
<i>Uh, how many teeth</i>

306
00:12:44,458 --> 00:12:46,062
<i>did Halley have when you left?</i>

307
00:12:46,906 --> 00:12:48,234
All of them.

308
00:12:48,322 --> 00:12:51,406
<i>Oh, yeah, that's-that's
what I was afraid of.</i>

309
00:12:52,652 --> 00:12:53,867
What happened?

310
00:12:53,955 --> 00:12:55,536
<i>Um, well, all right.</i>

311
00:12:55,624 --> 00:12:58,640
<i>Um, Michael had a little fever
last night.</i>

312
00:12:58,728 --> 00:12:59,750
Michael had a fever?

313
00:12:59,837 --> 00:13:01,685
<i>Do you want to hear about Halley
or not?</i>

314
00:13:02,275 --> 00:13:03,515
What happened, Stuart?

315
00:13:03,603 --> 00:13:06,458
<i>He was running a little fever,
nothing to worry about.</i>

316
00:13:06,546 --> 00:13:08,687
<i>And Halley, bless her heart,</i>

317
00:13:08,775 --> 00:13:10,557
<i>wanted to bring him
his boo-boo bear,</i>

318
00:13:10,645 --> 00:13:12,734
<i>so she climbed
over the safety rail</i>

319
00:13:12,822 --> 00:13:16,226
<i>and... took a little tumble
down the stairs.</i>

320
00:13:16,922 --> 00:13:18,625
She fell down the stairs?!

321
00:13:18,713 --> 00:13:21,507
<i>She rolled down the stairs,</i>

322
00:13:21,654 --> 00:13:23,875
<i>laughing the whole time.</i>

323
00:13:23,976 --> 00:13:25,445
<i>Anyway,
when she got to the bottom,</i>

324
00:13:25,625 --> 00:13:27,226
<i>there was a tooth missing.</i>

325
00:13:27,496 --> 00:13:28,966
Oh, Stuart!

326
00:13:29,054 --> 00:13:31,554
<i>She's fine!
She thought it was funny.</i>

327
00:13:32,472 --> 00:13:34,922
Did you at least save
it for the tooth fairy?

328
00:13:35,010 --> 00:13:36,925
<i>No, we couldn't find it.</i>

329
00:13:37,013 --> 00:13:38,265
<i>We have a theory</i>

330
00:13:38,353 --> 00:13:39,948
<i>about where it is,
but it'll take</i>

331
00:13:40,036 --> 00:13:42,772
six to eight hours to confirm.

332
00:13:44,367 --> 00:13:45,326
<i>Speaking of which,</i>

333
00:13:45,414 --> 00:13:48,265
<i>where do you keep
the spaghetti strainer?</i>

334
00:13:52,083 --> 00:13:53,897
Come on, you didn't
seriously expect him to react

335
00:13:53,984 --> 00:13:55,146
like a normal human being.

336
00:13:55,234 --> 00:13:56,951
No, but still,

337
00:13:57,039 --> 00:13:58,732
a-after all these years,

338
00:13:58,820 --> 00:14:00,411
after all the crap
I've put up with,

339
00:14:00,499 --> 00:14:01,947
you'd think just this once

340
00:14:02,035 --> 00:14:03,747
he'd care
about someone else's feelings.

341
00:14:03,835 --> 00:14:05,617
- Oh, my God!
- What?

342
00:14:05,705 --> 00:14:08,249
Pickled herring.
Who knew how good it was!

343
00:14:08,508 --> 00:14:09,717
Really?

344
00:14:09,805 --> 00:14:12,069
Sounds gross.
Looks gross. Smells gross.

345
00:14:12,553 --> 00:14:14,381
It's delicious!

346
00:14:16,336 --> 00:14:19,155
Ooh, that might
be my salted cod!

347
00:14:21,736 --> 00:14:22,850
What?

348
00:14:22,938 --> 00:14:25,124
Sheldon has something
he'd like to say.

349
00:14:25,213 --> 00:14:26,218
I'm sorry I didn't

350
00:14:26,305 --> 00:14:27,453
react appropriately.

351
00:14:27,541 --> 00:14:29,592
You and Penny are bringing
new life into the world.

352
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:31,695
Congratulations.
I can't wait to meet it.

353
00:14:31,938 --> 00:14:34,381
"It"?
That's a gender-neutral pronoun.

354
00:14:34,469 --> 00:14:36,741
If you're offended, take it
up with the English language.

355
00:14:37,885 --> 00:14:39,983
Oh, good, you're here.
Listen,

356
00:14:40,268 --> 00:14:43,551
we're thinking
maybe we should go back to L.A.

357
00:14:43,653 --> 00:14:45,061
Why?
We just can't

358
00:14:45,149 --> 00:14:46,525
be this far away from the kids.

359
00:14:46,613 --> 00:14:47,850
Bernie's having a meltdown,

360
00:14:47,938 --> 00:14:49,991
- and, frankly, so am I.
- Yeah, well,

361
00:14:50,079 --> 00:14:52,694
- pull it together.
- This is a big day for me.

362
00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:57,760
Yeah,
I wasn't sure what to do.

363
00:14:58,455 --> 00:15:00,182
Now I am.
We're going home.

364
00:15:00,270 --> 00:15:01,323
We'll join you.

365
00:15:01,411 --> 00:15:02,611
Oh, wait.
Do I get a vote in this?

366
00:15:02,698 --> 00:15:04,027
They'll have pickled
herring on the plane.

367
00:15:04,114 --> 00:15:05,416
Bye-bye.

368
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:09,807
Well, I hate to say it,

369
00:15:09,895 --> 00:15:12,760
but I think everyone
is being incredibly selfish.

370
00:15:13,377 --> 00:15:17,440
Well, you would be the authority
on the subject.

371
00:15:18,578 --> 00:15:19,885
What does that mean?

372
00:15:20,742 --> 00:15:23,625
Sheldon,
no one is happier than I am

373
00:15:23,759 --> 00:15:25,340
to win the Nobel.

374
00:15:25,596 --> 00:15:28,601
But it's not more important
than our friends.

375
00:15:29,135 --> 00:15:32,557
How can you call them friends
when they're abandoning us?

376
00:15:32,869 --> 00:15:34,174
They're abandoning us

377
00:15:34,262 --> 00:15:36,496
because you broke
their hearts.

378
00:15:39,622 --> 00:15:42,075
- I didn't mean to.
- I know!

379
00:15:42,637 --> 00:15:44,536
You never mean to.

380
00:15:45,745 --> 00:15:48,773
That's the only reason
people tolerate you!

381
00:15:50,619 --> 00:15:52,219
Does that include you?

382
00:15:54,746 --> 00:15:56,489
Sometimes, yeah.

383
00:16:07,075 --> 00:16:09,184
Okay, that's it for the fish.

384
00:16:09,368 --> 00:16:10,589
We'll be back
with the meatballs

385
00:16:10,676 --> 00:16:12,864
after a short word
from our sponsor.

386
00:16:14,083 --> 00:16:15,815
Oh, thank you.

387
00:16:18,566 --> 00:16:21,086
Leonard, I can't go home.

388
00:16:21,239 --> 00:16:23,656
- I have to be there for Amy.
- Yeah.

389
00:16:23,743 --> 00:16:25,558
I was thinking that, too.

390
00:16:25,645 --> 00:16:27,044
As angry as
I am at Sheldon,

391
00:16:27,132 --> 00:16:28,677
I still want to see him win
that medal.

392
00:16:29,226 --> 00:16:30,707
It's so strange.

393
00:16:31,014 --> 00:16:34,364
No matter how thoughtless
and selfish he is,

394
00:16:35,020 --> 00:16:36,661
I still love him.

395
00:16:36,861 --> 00:16:38,175
If you think about it,

396
00:16:38,270 --> 00:16:40,919
he has kind of been
our practice kid.

397
00:16:41,928 --> 00:16:43,591
Like when you make
pancakes

398
00:16:43,679 --> 00:16:46,333
and the first one
comes out a little wonky.

399
00:16:47,184 --> 00:16:49,755
The university prefers "quirky."

400
00:16:54,389 --> 00:16:55,604
Hello.

401
00:16:55,723 --> 00:16:56,922
Hey. It's Howard.

402
00:16:58,068 --> 00:16:59,473
Oh, us, too.

403
00:16:59,561 --> 00:17:01,677
Wait, what?
They're gonna stay.

404
00:17:01,765 --> 00:17:04,214
The kids are fine.
Bernie's parents took over.

405
00:17:04,684 --> 00:17:05,841
Really?

406
00:17:06,185 --> 00:17:08,122
Oh, poor little guy.

407
00:17:08,210 --> 00:17:09,231
Is Michael okay?

408
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:10,372
Yeah, it's Stuart.

409
00:17:10,460 --> 00:17:12,911
Bernie's dad gave him a hug,
cracked a rib.

410
00:17:14,933 --> 00:17:17,003
Yeah. Okay,
we'll meet you in the lobby.

411
00:17:21,173 --> 00:17:22,979
How long is it gonna take you
to get ready?

412
00:17:23,104 --> 00:17:25,370
Oh, I just need, like,
five or ten minutes.

413
00:17:25,458 --> 00:17:28,392
Really?
No. What is wrong with you?!

414
00:17:31,596 --> 00:17:33,479
And in the field of physics,

415
00:17:33,624 --> 00:17:35,906
Dr. Amy Farrah Fowler

416
00:17:36,001 --> 00:17:37,831
and Dr. Sheldon Cooper

417
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:40,868
for their discovery
of super-asymmetry.

418
00:17:52,966 --> 00:17:55,481
Just to be clear,
this isn't a date.

419
00:17:55,595 --> 00:17:56,915
Yeah, I know.

420
00:17:57,081 --> 00:17:59,159
Then why are you
holding my hand?

421
00:18:01,325 --> 00:18:02,964
Thank you, your majesties.

422
00:18:03,052 --> 00:18:05,362
Thank you
to the Nobel Committee.

423
00:18:06,146 --> 00:18:08,746
We are deeply honored.

424
00:18:09,634 --> 00:18:11,616
I would just like
to take this moment

425
00:18:11,883 --> 00:18:14,289
to say to all the young girls
out there

426
00:18:14,641 --> 00:18:17,636
who dream about science
as a profession:

427
00:18:18,070 --> 00:18:19,272
go for it.

428
00:18:19,867 --> 00:18:21,975
It is the greatest job

429
00:18:22,063 --> 00:18:23,523
in the world.

430
00:18:25,007 --> 00:18:28,239
And if anybody tells you
you can't, don't listen.

431
00:18:31,445 --> 00:18:32,797
And now,

432
00:18:33,117 --> 00:18:35,359
speaking of not listening,

433
00:18:36,209 --> 00:18:38,609
my husband,
Dr. Sheldon Cooper.

434
00:18:39,845 --> 00:18:41,145
Sheldon.

435
00:18:41,903 --> 00:18:44,303
What? Did you finish? Great job.

436
00:18:47,056 --> 00:18:48,989
Thank you, Dr. Fowler.

437
00:18:51,508 --> 00:18:53,306
I have a very long

438
00:18:53,393 --> 00:18:56,391
and somewhat self-centered
speech here.

439
00:18:58,282 --> 00:18:59,897
But I'd like to set it aside.

440
00:19:00,289 --> 00:19:01,448
- Yeah!
- Way to go!

441
00:19:06,206 --> 00:19:09,555
Because this honor
doesn't just belong to me.

442
00:19:11,312 --> 00:19:13,227
I wouldn't be up here
if it weren't

443
00:19:13,315 --> 00:19:16,141
for some very important people
in my life.

444
00:19:16,761 --> 00:19:21,180
Beginning with my mother,
father, meemaw,

445
00:19:21,851 --> 00:19:23,695
brother and sister.

446
00:19:26,508 --> 00:19:28,039
And my other family,

447
00:19:28,414 --> 00:19:30,883
who I'm so happy
to have here with us.

448
00:19:31,898 --> 00:19:34,365
Is that Buffy the
Vampire Slayer?

449
00:19:40,953 --> 00:19:43,086
I was under a misapprehension

450
00:19:43,174 --> 00:19:46,469
that my accomplishments
were mine alone.

451
00:19:48,699 --> 00:19:50,734
Nothing could be further
from the truth.

452
00:19:52,586 --> 00:19:53,867
I have been

453
00:19:53,955 --> 00:19:56,703
encouraged, sustained,

454
00:19:57,234 --> 00:20:00,573
inspired and tolerated

455
00:20:00,875 --> 00:20:02,992
not only by my wife,

456
00:20:03,930 --> 00:20:06,898
but by the greatest group
of friends anyone ever had.

457
00:20:10,156 --> 00:20:12,008
I'd like to ask them to stand.

458
00:20:14,174 --> 00:20:16,187
Dr. Rajesh Koothrappali.

459
00:20:20,213 --> 00:20:22,847
Dr. Bernadette
Rostenkowski Wolowitz.

460
00:20:26,786 --> 00:20:29,078
Astronaut Howard Wolowitz.

461
00:20:33,625 --> 00:20:36,219
And my two dearest friends
in the world,

462
00:20:38,039 --> 00:20:39,430
Penny Hofstadter...

463
00:20:44,773 --> 00:20:46,914
...and Dr. Leonard Hofstadter.

464
00:20:51,153 --> 00:20:53,875
I was there the moment
Leonard and Penny met.

465
00:20:54,601 --> 00:20:58,476
He said to me that their babies
would be smart<i> and</i> beautiful.

466
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:01,960
And now that they're expecting,

467
00:21:02,065 --> 00:21:04,247
I have no doubt that
that will be the case.

468
00:21:04,772 --> 00:21:07,773
Thanks, Sheldon. I-I haven't
told my parents yet, but thanks.

469
00:21:09,495 --> 00:21:12,496
Oh. I'm sorry.

470
00:21:13,373 --> 00:21:14,820
Don't tell anyone
that last thing.

471
00:21:14,908 --> 00:21:16,195
That's a secret.

472
00:21:17,898 --> 00:21:20,422
Howard, Bernadette,

473
00:21:21,359 --> 00:21:24,723
Raj, Penny, Leonard,

474
00:21:25,348 --> 00:21:28,434
I apologize if I haven't
been the friend you deserve.

475
00:21:30,614 --> 00:21:32,294
But I want you to know

476
00:21:33,208 --> 00:21:35,528
in my way,

477
00:21:36,949 --> 00:21:38,196
I love you all.

478
00:21:41,201 --> 00:21:42,567
And I love you.

479
00:21:46,538 --> 00:21:47,887
Thank you.

480
00:21:59,428 --> 00:22:03,979
<i>? Our whole universe
was in a hot, dense state ?</i>

481
00:22:04,067 --> 00:22:07,017
<i>? Then nearly
14 billion years ago ?</i>

482
00:22:07,118 --> 00:22:10,267
<i>? Expansion started... Wait ?</i>

483
00:22:10,551 --> 00:22:12,762
<i>? The Earth began to cool ?</i>

484
00:22:12,861 --> 00:22:17,475
<i>? The autotrophs began to drool,
Neanderthals developed tools ?</i>

485
00:22:17,563 --> 00:22:20,989
<i>? We built a Wall,
we built the pyramids ?</i>

486
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:23,749
<i>? Math, Science, History ?</i>

487
00:22:23,911 --> 00:22:26,886
<i>? Unraveling the mystery ?</i>

488
00:22:26,973 --> 00:22:32,489
<i>? That all started
with a big bang. ?</i>
