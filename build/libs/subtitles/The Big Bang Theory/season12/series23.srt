00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:01,956
<i>Previously,</i>
<i>on</i> The Big Bang Theory...

2
00:00:02,302 --> 00:00:04,079
Guess I'm your new neighbor.
Penny.

3
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:05,879
- Oh. Leonard. Sheldon.
- Hi.

4
00:00:05,948 --> 00:00:06,613
- Hi.
- Hi.

5
00:00:06,682 --> 00:00:08,449
- Hi.
- Hi.

6
00:00:08,517 --> 00:00:10,284
That's where <i>I</i> sit.

7
00:00:10,352 --> 00:00:11,251
Howard Wolowitz.

8
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:12,953
Caltech Department
of Applied Physics.

9
00:00:13,022 --> 00:00:13,954
Penny?

10
00:00:14,023 --> 00:00:15,089
Leonard.

11
00:00:15,157 --> 00:00:16,490
Raj?

12
00:00:16,559 --> 00:00:18,270
He speaks English--
he just can't speak to women.

13
00:00:18,294 --> 00:00:20,027
<i>Our babies will be</i>

14
00:00:20,096 --> 00:00:21,495
smart <i>and</i> beautiful.

15
00:00:21,564 --> 00:00:22,663
Finally caught a break.

16
00:00:22,732 --> 00:00:24,698
? Soft kitty... ?

17
00:00:24,767 --> 00:00:26,011
You know my girlfriend,
Bernadette.

18
00:00:26,035 --> 00:00:28,402
Howard, I'm hungry!

19
00:00:28,471 --> 00:00:30,471
? Warm kitty... ?

20
00:00:32,274 --> 00:00:34,975
? Little ball of fur... ?

21
00:00:35,044 --> 00:00:37,044
I'm Amy Farrah Fowler.
You're Sheldon Cooper.

22
00:00:39,381 --> 00:00:40,114
Bazinga.

23
00:00:45,621 --> 00:00:48,188
Welcome to the premiere episode
of <i>Sheldon Cooper Presents</i>

24
00:00:48,257 --> 00:00:49,656
<i>Fun with Flags.</i>

25
00:00:49,725 --> 00:00:51,725
I'm going up in space.
Technically,

26
00:00:51,794 --> 00:00:53,327
<i>I'm an astronaut.</i>

27
00:00:53,395 --> 00:00:55,596
<i>Oy vey!</i>

28
00:00:56,870 --> 00:00:58,218
You're talking to me.

29
00:00:58,219 --> 00:01:00,619
I am.

30
00:01:01,989 --> 00:01:05,891
Bernadette Maryann
Rostenkowski...

31
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:08,961
We now pronounce you
husband and wife.

32
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:10,229
Amy?

33
00:01:10,298 --> 00:01:11,464
Howard?

34
00:01:11,532 --> 00:01:12,998
Angry Amy?

35
00:01:13,067 --> 00:01:14,500
I don't want you to say it

36
00:01:14,569 --> 00:01:16,513
just because social convention
dictates that you...

37
00:01:16,537 --> 00:01:17,470
I love you, too.

38
00:01:17,538 --> 00:01:18,871
Will you marry me?

39
00:01:18,940 --> 00:01:20,172
Yes.

40
00:01:20,241 --> 00:01:21,340
We did it!

41
00:01:21,409 --> 00:01:23,743
Well, I enjoyed that
more than I thought I would.

42
00:01:25,413 --> 00:01:26,712
I wonder which one's Halley.

43
00:01:30,785 --> 00:01:31,817
Will you marry me?

44
00:01:31,886 --> 00:01:32,718
<i>That...</i>

45
00:01:32,787 --> 00:01:35,454
means... positive?

46
00:01:35,523 --> 00:01:38,190
Super asymmetry, that's it!

47
00:01:38,259 --> 00:01:39,825
<i>Our paper was right.</i>

48
00:01:39,894 --> 00:01:42,294
- We did it!
- We did it?

49
00:01:42,363 --> 00:01:43,596
We did it!

50
00:01:44,999 --> 00:01:46,532
? Six times ten
to the eighth atoms ?

51
00:01:46,601 --> 00:01:48,267
? Of a radium in a lead jar ?

52
00:01:48,336 --> 00:01:50,302
? Six times ten to the eighth
atoms of radium ?

53
00:01:50,371 --> 00:01:52,505
? If the half-life of radium
should happen to pass ?

54
00:01:52,573 --> 00:01:54,306
? Three times ten
to the eighth atoms ?

55
00:01:54,375 --> 00:01:55,908
? Of a radium in a lead jar... ?

56
00:01:55,977 --> 00:01:57,009
Really hope

57
00:01:57,078 --> 00:01:58,340
you're almost to zero.

58
00:01:58,341 --> 00:02:00,846
No, see,
that's the beauty of half-lives:

59
00:02:00,915 --> 00:02:03,182
it's impossible to determine
when you'll arrive at zero.

60
00:02:03,251 --> 00:02:04,583
It's like
"Wheels on the Bus"

61
00:02:04,652 --> 00:02:07,987
if the bus had
an unknowable number of parts.

62
00:02:09,123 --> 00:02:10,434
Yeah, we're gonna need
more coffee.

63
00:02:10,458 --> 00:02:13,225
Yep. I'm with you.
Leonard, coffee?

64
00:02:13,294 --> 00:02:15,928
Black and strong,
like Luke Cage.

65
00:02:15,997 --> 00:02:18,998
I'm too tired
to even be disturbed by that.

66
00:02:19,066 --> 00:02:20,166
Sheldon?

67
00:02:20,234 --> 00:02:21,567
Mm, absolutely not, no.

68
00:02:21,636 --> 00:02:24,403
The Nobel committee will be
making the calls to inform

69
00:02:24,472 --> 00:02:26,939
the winners at any minute,
so the only drug I need

70
00:02:27,008 --> 00:02:28,674
is the endorphins pumping
through my brain

71
00:02:28,743 --> 00:02:30,509
in anticipation of our victory.

72
00:02:30,578 --> 00:02:32,256
Well, technically, anticipation
wouldn't be mediated

73
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:34,847
by endorphins as much
as dopamine, but, you know,

74
00:02:34,916 --> 00:02:37,550
you've been up all night,
so I'll give you that one.

75
00:02:41,122 --> 00:02:44,089
Really? The second
he stops talking?

76
00:02:44,158 --> 00:02:46,525
Well... should we wake him up?

77
00:02:46,594 --> 00:02:48,661
Well, he did say
if he fell asleep,

78
00:02:48,729 --> 00:02:51,197
we were allowed
to slap him awake.

79
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:53,866
Oh, boy.

80
00:02:54,969 --> 00:02:56,936
Wait a minute.
Why do you get to do it?

81
00:02:57,004 --> 00:02:57,692
'Cause I called it.

82
00:02:57,716 --> 00:02:59,716
Well, you can't just call it.
You have to earn it.

83
00:02:59,974 --> 00:03:01,373
Oh, and you've earned it?

84
00:03:01,442 --> 00:03:04,777
No one has earned it
more than me.

85
00:03:08,816 --> 00:03:11,717
You have your whole life
to smack him around.

86
00:03:11,752 --> 00:03:13,118
This is my time.

87
00:03:14,222 --> 00:03:16,021
Fine. Don't miss.

88
00:03:16,090 --> 00:03:19,325
It's not a volleyball.
I can handle it.

89
00:03:19,393 --> 00:03:20,693
Oh, wait. Hang on.

90
00:03:20,761 --> 00:03:23,262
When you're old, you are
gonna want a record of this.

91
00:03:23,331 --> 00:03:24,396
Oh, oh, yeah.

92
00:03:24,465 --> 00:03:27,466
Do it in slo-mo.
I want to see his cheeks ripple.

93
00:03:29,136 --> 00:03:30,503
Ready... go.

94
00:03:30,571 --> 00:03:32,738
It's happening!

95
00:03:32,807 --> 00:03:34,773
Unknown caller.
It's got to be them.

96
00:03:34,842 --> 00:03:36,775
Okay, put it on speaker.

97
00:03:36,844 --> 00:03:38,210
- Hello?
- Hi.

98
00:03:38,279 --> 00:03:40,746
Hello. This is Sweden calling.

99
00:03:42,984 --> 00:03:45,284
Is this Dr. Cooper
and Dr. Fowler?

100
00:03:45,353 --> 00:03:46,519
- Yes.
- Yeah.

101
00:03:46,587 --> 00:03:48,354
Congratulations.

102
00:03:48,422 --> 00:03:51,757
It is my pleasure to inform you
that you've won the Nobel Prize

103
00:03:51,826 --> 00:03:53,993
in being suckers...!

104
00:03:57,732 --> 00:04:00,266
His Swedish accent
was very convincing.

105
00:04:02,069 --> 00:04:04,270
This is it!

106
00:04:04,338 --> 00:04:06,438
What do you want, Howard?

107
00:04:06,507 --> 00:04:08,440
We were just calling to see
if you'd heard yet.

108
00:04:08,509 --> 00:04:09,608
We haven't.

109
00:04:09,677 --> 00:04:10,797
But thank you for getting up

110
00:04:10,845 --> 00:04:11,777
so early to call.

111
00:04:11,846 --> 00:04:12,945
That was very thoughtful.

112
00:04:13,014 --> 00:04:14,414
Oh, please. We have
two little kids.

113
00:04:14,482 --> 00:04:16,549
We've been up for an hour.

114
00:04:16,617 --> 00:04:18,684
Did anyone get to slap Sheldon?

115
00:04:18,753 --> 00:04:20,452
No.

116
00:04:20,521 --> 00:04:22,054
Okay, well, call us
when you hear.

117
00:04:22,123 --> 00:04:24,523
All right,
now what?

118
00:04:24,592 --> 00:04:27,192
Oh, why don't we play a game
to pass the time?

119
00:04:27,261 --> 00:04:29,528
Here. Uh, I am thinking
of a number.

120
00:04:29,597 --> 00:04:33,098
Hint: it's a cube of a cube
of a prime.

121
00:04:33,167 --> 00:04:35,067
There's an infinite number
of possibilities.

122
00:04:35,136 --> 00:04:36,569
What, you got somewhere to be?

123
00:04:38,272 --> 00:04:40,806
Oh. That's me.

124
00:04:40,875 --> 00:04:42,241
Hello?

125
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:44,843
Yes, this is Dr. Fowler.

126
00:04:46,247 --> 00:04:47,279
I see.

127
00:04:48,816 --> 00:04:50,482
Okay, thank you.

128
00:04:53,955 --> 00:04:55,487
We won.

129
00:05:02,797 --> 00:05:04,830
Congratulations!

130
00:05:04,899 --> 00:05:06,365
Oh, my God!

131
00:05:06,434 --> 00:05:08,667
- We did it.
-I know.

132
00:05:08,736 --> 00:05:10,169
Can you believe it?

133
00:05:10,237 --> 00:05:12,671
That's a good point.
What if I'm dreaming?

134
00:05:19,814 --> 00:05:21,480
We won the Nobel Prize!

I think so.

149
00:06:00,187 --> 00:06:01,873
You would.
That makes sense.

Ooh.

one from my mom.

Boy, they don't tell you
when you win a Nobel

it chews up

159

Oh, that's me.

160
00:06:25,331 --> 00:06:28,199
It's CVS.
My prescription's ready.

00:06:28,267 --> 00:06:30,401
Oh, and also my dad.

162
00:06:30,469 --> 00:06:33,037

163
00:06:33,105 --> 00:06:34,238

Oh.

00:06:35,441 --> 00:06:37,675
Oh, it's your dad. I'm good.

166
00:06:37,743 --> 00:06:39,710
You know, when you
think about it,

167
00:06:39,779 --> 00:06:41,478
now that we're Nobel
Prize winners,

168
00:06:41,547 --> 00:06:43,303
our names will be linked
together forever.

169
00:06:43,327 --> 00:06:44,282
We're married.

170
00:06:44,283 --> 00:06:45,928
Our names are already
linked together forever.

171
00:06:45,952 --> 00:06:47,952
Oh, please. That's
just a piece of paper.

172
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:50,454
This is a piece of paper
and a medal.

173
00:06:51,490 --> 00:06:52,423
It's weird.

174
00:06:52,491 --> 00:06:54,225
I don't really
feel different,

175
00:06:54,293 --> 00:06:56,060
but I guess our lives
will never be the same.

176
00:06:56,128 --> 00:06:59,597
Oh, I don't know. We're
going to work like always.

177
00:06:59,665 --> 00:07:02,333
I still put my pants on
both legs at a time.

178
00:07:02,401 --> 00:07:05,769
One day that's
gonna end very badly.

179
00:07:11,844 --> 00:07:13,611
Congratulations.
How does it feel?

180
00:07:13,679 --> 00:07:16,146
Okay, w-we're happy
to answer your questions,

181
00:07:16,215 --> 00:07:17,815
Just, um,
one at a time, please?

182
00:07:17,883 --> 00:07:19,250
Dr. Cooper!

183
00:07:21,587 --> 00:07:22,786
Is Dr. Cooper coming back?

184
00:07:22,855 --> 00:07:25,055
No. Next question.

185
00:07:28,127 --> 00:07:30,928
Was it your left hand
or your right hand?

186
00:07:31,998 --> 00:07:33,464
Right.

187
00:07:33,532 --> 00:07:36,300
Spit actually flew
out of his mouth.

188
00:07:36,369 --> 00:07:38,369
Hey, fellas.

189
00:07:39,805 --> 00:07:41,372
Can you do me a favor?

190
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:42,539
Do we have a choice?

191
00:07:42,608 --> 00:07:43,608
Ha-ha!

192
00:07:43,643 --> 00:07:44,708
No.

193
00:07:44,777 --> 00:07:46,443
Sheldon and Amy

194
00:07:46,512 --> 00:07:48,223
are now officially superstars,
and the press

195
00:07:48,247 --> 00:07:50,914
will be reaching out to their
family and friends for comment.

196
00:07:50,983 --> 00:07:53,183
So that we're all
on the same page,

197
00:07:53,252 --> 00:07:56,453
the word we're gonna use
to describe them is "quirky."

198
00:07:56,522 --> 00:07:58,922
And not <i>quirky.</i>
More like <i>quirky.</i>

199
00:07:58,991 --> 00:08:00,924
So not Mr. and Mrs.
Wackadoodle?

200
00:08:00,993 --> 00:08:02,092
Ho-ho-ho!

201
00:08:02,161 --> 00:08:06,163
You bitter, envious little man.

202
00:08:10,870 --> 00:08:12,803
Thank you so much.

203
00:08:17,276 --> 00:08:18,876
And what do we call that?

204
00:08:18,944 --> 00:08:20,678
- Quirky. - Quirky.
- Quirky.

205
00:08:23,316 --> 00:08:26,150
Dr. Cooper, can I get
a minute of your time?

206
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:28,952
Hello?

207
00:08:29,021 --> 00:08:30,087
Hey.

208
00:08:30,122 --> 00:08:31,400
- Can I help you?
- Uh, yeah, actually.

209
00:08:31,424 --> 00:08:32,990
Um, I had an appointment

210
00:08:33,059 --> 00:08:35,225
to interview Dr. Cooper
about the Nobel.

211
00:08:35,261 --> 00:08:36,560
Hang on a second.

212
00:08:36,629 --> 00:08:37,629
Sheldon?

213
00:08:45,104 --> 00:08:47,237
Sorry, he's not here.

214
00:08:47,306 --> 00:08:49,440
Damn. I've got a deadline.

215
00:08:49,508 --> 00:08:52,009
I don't know
if it helps you at all,

216
00:08:52,078 --> 00:08:55,546
but I'm his best friend
in the whole world.

217
00:08:55,614 --> 00:08:56,914
Really?

218
00:08:56,982 --> 00:08:58,827
And an astronaut. Come on,
you can buy me a cup of coffee,

219
00:08:58,851 --> 00:09:01,318
and I'll tell
you about both.

220
00:09:09,528 --> 00:09:11,562
Everyone okay in there?

221
00:09:11,630 --> 00:09:12,996
Go away!

222
00:09:13,065 --> 00:09:14,798
Amy?

223
00:09:14,867 --> 00:09:17,401
Raj, please, not now.

224
00:09:17,470 --> 00:09:20,003
Hey, what's wrong?

225
00:09:20,072 --> 00:09:21,505
My picture's
all over the Internet,

226
00:09:21,574 --> 00:09:23,240
and I look terrible.

227
00:09:23,309 --> 00:09:24,908
No. Let me see.

228
00:09:24,977 --> 00:09:28,045
Well, that is
an unfortunate angle.

229
00:09:28,114 --> 00:09:30,147
But who cares?

230
00:09:30,216 --> 00:09:31,448
You just won the Nobel.

231
00:09:31,517 --> 00:09:33,550
You should be proud
of this moment.

232
00:09:33,619 --> 00:09:35,319
I know I shouldn't care
about how I look,

233
00:09:35,388 --> 00:09:36,820
and I never thought I did.

234
00:09:36,889 --> 00:09:40,190
It-It's stupid and shallow,
but I just can't help it.

235
00:09:40,259 --> 00:09:42,693
Am I really this frumpy?

236
00:09:42,762 --> 00:09:45,963
No. No, you are
a beautiful woman.

237
00:09:46,031 --> 00:09:47,831
By the way,
if you're not happy

238
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:49,967
with those pictures,
then make some changes.

239
00:09:50,035 --> 00:09:52,436
Get a haircut, new clothes,

240
00:09:52,505 --> 00:09:54,438
new glasses, big glasses...

241
00:09:54,507 --> 00:09:57,107
No glasses-- then you won't
be able to see those pictures.

242
00:09:58,210 --> 00:10:00,043
Sounds expensive.

243
00:10:00,112 --> 00:10:02,613
Excuse me,
i-if I'm not mistaken,

244
00:10:02,681 --> 00:10:05,416
the Nobel comes with
a substantial cash prize.

245
00:10:05,484 --> 00:10:07,117
What were you gonna
spend it on?

246
00:10:07,186 --> 00:10:09,453
Hadn't really
thought about it.

247
00:10:09,522 --> 00:10:13,290
Sheldon's got his eyes
on some new Dockers.

248
00:10:13,359 --> 00:10:16,627
Come on.
Do something for yourself.

249
00:10:16,695 --> 00:10:19,296
Well, I suppose
I could get a haircut.

250
00:10:19,365 --> 00:10:22,900
And some makeup
and a new wardrobe

251
00:10:22,968 --> 00:10:25,035
and a little thank you gift
for your shopping buddy

252
00:10:25,104 --> 00:10:26,804
if we see something
he likes. Come on.

253
00:10:26,872 --> 00:10:28,372
Where are we going?

254
00:10:28,441 --> 00:10:31,475
Beverly Hills,
where the things he likes are.

255
00:10:34,914 --> 00:10:36,180
Dinner ready?

256
00:10:36,248 --> 00:10:38,182
Not unless you cooked.

257
00:10:40,219 --> 00:10:43,587
Why is this article
about Sheldon all about you?

258
00:10:45,391 --> 00:10:46,323
Let me see.

259
00:10:46,392 --> 00:10:49,626
Oh, good, they used
my NASA picture.

260
00:10:49,695 --> 00:10:52,896
Why does it say that
you're his best friend?

261
00:10:52,965 --> 00:10:54,164
Leonard's his best friend.

262
00:10:54,233 --> 00:10:55,732
No. Leonard
has always been

263
00:10:55,801 --> 00:10:57,868
kind of a monkey butler.

264
00:10:57,937 --> 00:10:59,903
Whenever Sheldon
got into a scrape,

265
00:10:59,972 --> 00:11:01,839
I was his go-to guy.

266
00:11:03,242 --> 00:11:04,541
When did he get
into a scrape?

267
00:11:04,610 --> 00:11:06,410
You're kidding, right?

268
00:11:06,479 --> 00:11:07,923
W-- Remember
when he had a panic attack

269
00:11:07,947 --> 00:11:09,524
'cause his hand got stuck
in a jar of olives?

270
00:11:09,548 --> 00:11:13,217
I was the one who told him
to let go of the olives.

271
00:11:14,553 --> 00:11:17,688
Please, that doesn't
make you his best friend.

272
00:11:19,091 --> 00:11:21,091
You know,
that reporter asked me

273
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:23,427
if I could put him in touch
with...

274
00:11:23,496 --> 00:11:24,995
Amy's best friend.

275
00:11:25,064 --> 00:11:26,096
That's Penny.

276
00:11:26,165 --> 00:11:28,332
Doesn't have to be.

277
00:11:32,671 --> 00:11:34,304
Hmm.

278
00:11:34,373 --> 00:11:36,940
What kind of tea
is appropriate

279
00:11:37,009 --> 00:11:39,843
for winning a Nobel Prize
and now everything is changing

280
00:11:39,912 --> 00:11:43,413
and you feel unmoored
from reality?

281
00:11:43,482 --> 00:11:46,116
I don't know. Earl Grey?

282
00:11:46,185 --> 00:11:47,384
You know,

283
00:11:47,453 --> 00:11:49,453
this is something
I've wanted my whole life.

284
00:11:49,522 --> 00:11:50,921
But I guess I never considered

285
00:11:50,990 --> 00:11:52,456
how everything
would be different.

286
00:11:52,525 --> 00:11:55,058
Buddy, I-I know it all feels
overwhelming right now,

287
00:11:55,127 --> 00:11:57,060
but I promise you,
things will settle down.

288
00:11:57,129 --> 00:11:58,061
There's no Earl Grey!

289
00:11:58,130 --> 00:11:59,730
You filthy liar!

290
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:03,634
Hey, is Penny here?

291
00:12:03,702 --> 00:12:04,702
No. Why?

292
00:12:04,770 --> 00:12:05,903
I wanted to show her

293
00:12:05,971 --> 00:12:07,037
my latest creation.

294
00:12:07,106 --> 00:12:08,572
I give you...

295
00:12:08,641 --> 00:12:11,508
Dr. Amy Farrah Fowler.

296
00:12:18,517 --> 00:12:20,384
Wow. Amy, you
look amazing.

297
00:12:20,452 --> 00:12:21,752
Thank you.

298
00:12:21,787 --> 00:12:24,588
Sheldon, what do you think?

299
00:12:29,128 --> 00:12:31,461
I like you better
the way you were.

300
00:12:31,530 --> 00:12:34,665
But she looks
beautiful!

301
00:12:34,733 --> 00:12:36,667
Classic lines,

302
00:12:36,735 --> 00:12:38,046
colors that complement
her skin tone,

303
00:12:38,070 --> 00:12:42,005
and hair that goes from "office"
to "on the town" in minutes.

304
00:12:44,209 --> 00:12:46,577
I don't care.
Put it back.

305
00:12:46,645 --> 00:12:48,679
I like the way I look.

306
00:12:48,747 --> 00:12:51,081
Well, I don't!

307
00:12:52,484 --> 00:12:54,084
My fault.
I was out of Earl Grey.

308
00:12:57,489 --> 00:12:59,323
Sheldon, that was really rude.

309
00:12:59,391 --> 00:13:01,959
I'm sorry. Amy is
the one constant I can count on,

310
00:13:02,027 --> 00:13:03,594
and now she's changing.

311
00:13:03,662 --> 00:13:05,429
It's just a haircut
and some clothes.

312
00:13:05,497 --> 00:13:06,697
No, it's
the last straw!

313
00:13:06,765 --> 00:13:09,099
I can't take any more!

314
00:13:16,241 --> 00:13:17,507
Can you believe it?

315
00:13:17,576 --> 00:13:18,856
They finally fixed the elevator.

316
00:13:25,216 --> 00:13:27,249
This is
a nightmare.

317
00:13:27,627 --> 00:13:28,557
What's with him?

318
00:13:28,558 --> 00:13:30,791
He won a Nobel Prize,
and his wife looks amazing.

319
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:33,360
Oh. Yeah, got it.

320
00:13:53,282 --> 00:13:54,948
How did you get down here?

321
00:13:55,017 --> 00:13:56,683
The elevator. It's really fast.

322
00:13:58,521 --> 00:13:59,853
I-I need to be alone right now.

323
00:13:59,922 --> 00:14:00,854
Don't try to follow me.

324
00:14:00,923 --> 00:14:01,855
All right.
You need a ride?

325
00:14:01,924 --> 00:14:04,491
That'd be great.
Thank you.

326
00:14:05,928 --> 00:14:07,861
I should've seen this coming.

327
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:09,963
Oh, stop. You're allowed
to get a haircut.

328
00:14:10,032 --> 00:14:11,032
I know.

329
00:14:11,066 --> 00:14:13,000
But I should've done it
gradually.

330
00:14:13,068 --> 00:14:16,603
You know, like...

331
00:14:16,672 --> 00:14:20,774
maybe 300 tiny haircuts
over a ten-year period.

332
00:14:21,977 --> 00:14:24,645
Okay, you need to
focus on the positive.

333
00:14:24,713 --> 00:14:26,847
You won a Nobel Prize.

334
00:14:26,916 --> 00:14:28,048
I slapped Sheldon.

335
00:14:28,117 --> 00:14:30,851
A lot of dreams
came true today.

336
00:14:31,887 --> 00:14:34,021
You know, you're right.

337
00:14:34,089 --> 00:14:35,956
This is a huge day for me,

338
00:14:36,025 --> 00:14:37,558
and I'm allowed to enjoy it

339
00:14:37,626 --> 00:14:40,260
without worrying how
it's going to affect my husband.

340
00:14:40,329 --> 00:14:41,862
Is it me

341
00:14:41,931 --> 00:14:45,199
or did it just
get fierce in here?

342
00:14:48,437 --> 00:14:51,505
All this change
is just too much.

343
00:14:51,574 --> 00:14:53,607
The reporters,

344
00:14:53,676 --> 00:14:54,875
the attention at work,

345
00:14:54,944 --> 00:14:56,543
and now even Amy's changed.

346
00:14:56,612 --> 00:14:58,078
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

347
00:14:58,147 --> 00:14:59,913
- Slow down.
- I'm playing a drinking game.

348
00:14:59,982 --> 00:15:01,448
Every time you say
the word "change,"

349
00:15:01,517 --> 00:15:03,750
I take a slug.

350
00:15:03,819 --> 00:15:06,286
Are you gonna be able
to drive me home?

351
00:15:06,355 --> 00:15:08,288
Mm. Not unless you
change the subject.

352
00:15:08,357 --> 00:15:10,624
Huh. Now I said it.

353
00:15:10,693 --> 00:15:12,626
Meh. Hmm.

354
00:15:15,965 --> 00:15:17,742
You know, you're the
only person who could win

355
00:15:17,766 --> 00:15:20,567
the biggest prize in science
and still be upset about it.

356
00:15:20,636 --> 00:15:21,735
It's just...

357
00:15:21,804 --> 00:15:23,737
all the times
I thought about winning,

358
00:15:23,806 --> 00:15:25,372
I never thought
about how it would ch--

359
00:15:25,441 --> 00:15:28,208
affect my life.

360
00:15:29,645 --> 00:15:31,878
I'm sorry, I'm genuinely
concerned about your liver.

361
00:15:31,947 --> 00:15:33,080
Okay.

362
00:15:33,148 --> 00:15:35,882
Fine, I'll stop playing.

363
00:15:35,951 --> 00:15:38,263
You know, you go on and on about
wanting things to stay the same,

364
00:15:38,287 --> 00:15:40,487
but you've changed a
lot since I met you.

365
00:15:40,556 --> 00:15:43,423
Oh, you are a mean drunk.

366
00:15:43,492 --> 00:15:44,691
I'm serious.

367
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:46,426
You have a ton of friends,

368
00:15:46,495 --> 00:15:49,096
you got married, moved
into a new apartment,

369
00:15:49,164 --> 00:15:51,365
you wore a baseball
hat that one time.

370
00:15:51,433 --> 00:15:55,969
Heck, you've had sex almost as
many times as I have fingers.

371
00:15:57,306 --> 00:15:58,238
More.

372
00:15:58,307 --> 00:15:59,239
W...

373
00:15:59,308 --> 00:16:00,907
By this many.

374
00:16:00,976 --> 00:16:02,576
You dog!

375
00:16:02,645 --> 00:16:03,722
It was the <i>Avengers</i> trailer.

376
00:16:03,746 --> 00:16:04,678
Oh.

377
00:16:04,747 --> 00:16:06,079
Mm-hmm.

378
00:16:06,148 --> 00:16:07,726
You know, I've grown, too.
I used to be the bartender

379
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:09,316
back there.
- That's true.

380
00:16:09,385 --> 00:16:11,029
And now there is
a completely different woman

381
00:16:11,053 --> 00:16:12,719
who botched my drink order.

382
00:16:12,788 --> 00:16:15,589
How hard is 65% Coke,
35% Diet Coke?

383
00:16:16,692 --> 00:16:18,458
Well, judging
by the look on her face,

384
00:16:18,527 --> 00:16:20,794
it's at least
one percent saliva.

385
00:16:24,733 --> 00:16:26,066
I do take your point.

386
00:16:26,135 --> 00:16:27,467
You know,
you're also married,

387
00:16:27,536 --> 00:16:30,203
you have a successful career,
you no longer dress

388
00:16:30,272 --> 00:16:34,174
like you're trying
to attract sailors by the wharf.

389
00:16:34,243 --> 00:16:37,644
So, I guess the only thing
that actually stays the same

390
00:16:37,713 --> 00:16:39,780
is that things are
always changing.

391
00:16:40,883 --> 00:16:42,949
Interesting.

392
00:16:43,018 --> 00:16:46,553
So you're saying
the inevitability of change

393
00:16:46,622 --> 00:16:49,022
might be
a universal constant.

394
00:16:49,091 --> 00:16:52,859
Well, there's a little more to
it than that, but, yeah, sure.

395
00:16:52,928 --> 00:16:55,696
Oh. Hey, look,
that's Bernadette.

396
00:16:55,764 --> 00:16:59,900
I can't tell you how many times
Dr. Fowler was gonna give up

397
00:16:59,968 --> 00:17:00,968
and I would say to her,

398
00:17:01,036 --> 00:17:03,337
"Amy, as your best friend,

399
00:17:03,372 --> 00:17:05,372
I'm not gonna let you quit."

400
00:17:05,441 --> 00:17:07,841
Okay, I'm drinking again.

401
00:17:07,910 --> 00:17:09,142
I'll join you.
Waitress,

402
00:17:09,211 --> 00:17:11,912
uh, 95% Hawaiian Punch,
five percent vodka.

403
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:12,913
Let me tell you about the time

404
00:17:12,981 --> 00:17:14,981
Mr. Nobel Laureate
wanted olives...

405
00:17:15,050 --> 00:17:17,484
This is a good one.

406
00:17:17,553 --> 00:17:19,353
You know what, 90/10!

407
00:17:22,624 --> 00:17:25,359
You know, I like
the way my hair looks.

408
00:17:25,427 --> 00:17:27,394
I'm done tiptoeing
around him.

409
00:17:27,463 --> 00:17:28,729
We're all guilty of it.

410
00:17:28,797 --> 00:17:30,530
But why?

411
00:17:30,599 --> 00:17:31,998
'Cause we were afraid
to upset him.

412
00:17:32,067 --> 00:17:32,999
Which happens anyway.

413
00:17:33,068 --> 00:17:34,868
Well, that's over.

414
00:17:34,937 --> 00:17:36,837
I'm-I'm done enabling him.
Like,

415
00:17:36,905 --> 00:17:37,905
this is his spot

416
00:17:37,973 --> 00:17:40,741
and-and the thermostat
has to be set

417
00:17:40,809 --> 00:17:42,209
to <i>his</i> comfort level,

418
00:17:42,277 --> 00:17:43,621
even though he doesn't
even live here anymore

419
00:17:43,645 --> 00:17:46,513
and I'm always chilly.

420
00:17:47,616 --> 00:17:51,184
Is that why you wear
a hoodie all the time?

421
00:17:52,287 --> 00:17:54,788
Why would-- Yes!

422
00:17:54,857 --> 00:17:57,391
To accommodate
Sheldon!

423
00:17:57,459 --> 00:17:58,859
And what-what
about this-this thing?

424
00:17:58,894 --> 00:18:01,094
Why is it here?
I'll tell you why.

425
00:18:01,163 --> 00:18:02,474
Because it was here
when I moved in,

426
00:18:02,498 --> 00:18:04,097
and, for no earthly reason,

427
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:06,566
he forbade me to touch it.

428
00:18:06,635 --> 00:18:07,768
Well, if you don't like it,

429
00:18:07,836 --> 00:18:09,269
get rid of it.

430
00:18:09,338 --> 00:18:11,071
Put it in the closet.

431
00:18:11,140 --> 00:18:13,140
You know what,

432
00:18:13,208 --> 00:18:15,509
I will.

433
00:18:22,117 --> 00:18:25,018
I bet that's the reason.

434
00:18:31,393 --> 00:18:33,326
Hang on.

435
00:18:37,533 --> 00:18:38,465
What do you think?

436
00:18:38,534 --> 00:18:39,534
Want to give it a try?

437
00:18:53,482 --> 00:18:54,748
Well, you know,

438
00:18:54,817 --> 00:18:57,551
the elevator did work
when I moved into the building.

439
00:18:57,619 --> 00:19:00,554
So going up and down the stairs
was a change,

440
00:19:00,622 --> 00:19:03,957
which means this would actually
be a return to the status quo.

441
00:19:04,026 --> 00:19:05,546
- But, conversely, I think...
- Get in!

442
00:19:12,367 --> 00:19:14,768
This is wild.

This might be the glue talking,

451
00:19:42,786 --> 00:19:46,454
but that was a very pleasurable
139 and a half hours.

452
00:19:46,523 --> 00:19:47,523
Agreed.

453
00:19:47,557 --> 00:19:49,657
What kind of DNA
is this, anyway?

454
00:19:49,726 --> 00:19:51,659
I was trying to design
the genetic code

455
00:19:51,728 --> 00:19:53,661
of an advanced race
of human being.

456
00:19:53,730 --> 00:19:55,414
One of my rare failures,
actually.

457
00:19:55,438 --> 00:19:56,265
What went wrong?

458
00:19:56,266 --> 00:19:59,067
The balls kept
sticking to my pants.

459
00:19:59,136 --> 00:20:02,203
Let's just let it dry.

460
00:20:02,272 --> 00:20:03,671
- Hi. - Hello.
- Hey, babe.

461
00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:05,017
Oh, don't slam the...
Don't slam the...

462
00:20:09,312 --> 00:20:11,546
That was exhilarating.

463
00:20:12,949 --> 00:20:14,716
- You pick up your dresses?
- Yep.

464
00:20:14,785 --> 00:20:17,185
The tailor had to take mine in
and let Penny's out.

465
00:20:17,254 --> 00:20:19,220
Best day of my life.

466
00:20:20,590 --> 00:20:22,724
What about the day you met me?

467
00:20:22,793 --> 00:20:25,627
I stand by my statement.

468
00:20:25,695 --> 00:20:27,562
Well, thank you guys so much
for the clothes

469
00:20:27,631 --> 00:20:28,997
and the shoes,
the plane tickets.

470
00:20:29,065 --> 00:20:30,365
You've been so generous.

471
00:20:30,433 --> 00:20:32,044
Well, it's important
that all of our friends

472
00:20:32,068 --> 00:20:33,535
get to share
this moment with us.

473
00:20:33,603 --> 00:20:35,470
And then for years to come,
you can tell others

474
00:20:35,539 --> 00:20:36,883
you had a front-row
seat to history.

475
00:20:36,907 --> 00:20:37,972
Although, technically,

476
00:20:38,041 --> 00:20:41,075
I think your seats are
in the second row.

477
00:20:41,144 --> 00:20:43,878
Do you want to go back to the apartment
and see me try on my dress?

478
00:20:43,914 --> 00:20:46,192
Shouldn't I see it for the first
time at the Nobel ceremony?

479
00:20:46,216 --> 00:20:47,615
It's not a wedding.

480
00:20:47,684 --> 00:20:48,995
Okay. Well, give me
a minute to think

481
00:20:49,019 --> 00:20:50,619
of another reason I
don't want to see it.

482
00:20:51,788 --> 00:20:53,833
How about this-- you can
practice your acceptance speech

483
00:20:53,857 --> 00:20:55,223
while I try on the dress.

484
00:20:55,292 --> 00:20:58,793
Ah, great. You can help me
whittle it down to 90 minutes.

485
00:21:03,667 --> 00:21:06,201
Was Amy suspicious when
they had to let your dress out?

486
00:21:06,269 --> 00:21:09,904
No. She was so happy,
she didn't even question it.

487
00:21:09,973 --> 00:21:12,110
Someone's gonna figure it out.
Why don't we just tell people?

488
00:21:12,134 --> 00:21:13,008
No, it's too early.

489
00:21:13,009 --> 00:21:14,059
I haven't even wrapped
my head around it.

490
00:21:14,060 --> 00:21:17,212
- I have. My head is wrapped.
- Yeah, well...

491
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:20,782
if something else had been wrapped,
we wouldn't be in this situation.

492
00:21:20,851 --> 00:21:24,686
Excuse me, but if I recall, you're the one
who went out drinking with Sheldon,

493
00:21:24,754 --> 00:21:26,387
then came home and attacked me.

494
00:21:26,456 --> 00:21:28,957
Attacked you? I said,
"Do you wanna?"

495
00:21:29,025 --> 00:21:30,425
Yeah.

496
00:21:30,493 --> 00:21:33,194
- I was helpless.
-Uh-huh.

497
00:21:33,263 --> 00:21:34,963
So...

498
00:21:35,031 --> 00:21:38,166
do you wanna?

499
00:21:38,235 --> 00:21:40,568
- Well, I can't get more pregnant.
- Mm-hmm.

500
00:21:40,637 --> 00:21:41,204
We'll see about that.

are going away
for a couple days,

513
00:22:10,587 --> 00:22:12,131
so if you're gonna say

you got to do it now
or wait till we get back.

522
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:34,342
I guess. I just hope we don't
miss Michael's first words.

00:22:54,797 --> 00:22:56,497
is gonna help me meet girls?

531
00:22:56,566 --> 00:22:58,599
Cinnamon is chick bait.

532
00:22:58,668 --> 00:23:00,501
Good. 'Cause I'm not.

533
00:23:00,570 --> 00:23:01,903
Just remember,

534
00:23:01,971 --> 00:23:03,771
you're in charge.

535
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:05,473
Don't let her pull <i>you.</i>

536
00:23:07,310 --> 00:23:11,179
That seems like
an unnecessary thing to say.

537
00:23:11,247 --> 00:23:14,081
And please, if you have
any problems, any questions,

538
00:23:14,150 --> 00:23:15,650
call me immediately, okay?

539
00:23:15,718 --> 00:23:17,618
She's my baby.

540
00:23:17,687 --> 00:23:19,687
It shouldn't come up,
but just in case:

541
00:23:19,756 --> 00:23:22,890
where could I buy a dog
that looks exactly like her?

542
00:23:24,527 --> 00:23:27,261
Kidding. If she dies,
I'll just tell you.

543
00:23:29,699 --> 00:23:30,898
Ready?

544
00:23:30,967 --> 00:23:32,333
Oh. Hang on.

545
00:23:35,705 --> 00:23:37,305
Go.

546
00:23:37,373 --> 00:23:38,484
"Your majesties, members
of the Nobel Academy--

547
00:23:38,508 --> 00:23:40,186
"when I was a young boy
growing up in East Texas

548
00:23:40,210 --> 00:23:41,620
"I always knew
I'd wind up on this stage,

549
00:23:41,644 --> 00:23:42,922
"and everybody
who said I wouldn't looks

550
00:23:42,946 --> 00:23:44,657
"pretty darn foolish right now.
I'm talking about you,

551
00:23:44,681 --> 00:23:45,886
high school science teacher
Mr. Hubert Givens..."

552
00:23:45,887 --> 00:23:49,116
Sheldon, Sheldon.
Why are you talking so fast?

553
00:23:49,185 --> 00:23:51,953
I'm trying to get my speech
down to 90 minutes.

554
00:23:52,021 --> 00:23:54,855
Nobody's gonna be able to
understand a word you're saying.

555
00:23:54,924 --> 00:23:57,225
Welcome to my life.

556
00:23:57,293 --> 00:23:59,694
I think you need
to do some editing,

557
00:23:59,762 --> 00:24:02,330
like maybe cut out all
that stuff about your childhood.

558
00:24:02,398 --> 00:24:05,266
Are you kidding? Growing up
in the backwoods of East Texas

559
00:24:05,335 --> 00:24:08,836
is what makes me warm
and relatable.

560
00:24:08,905 --> 00:24:10,238
Well, what about all these pages

561
00:24:10,306 --> 00:24:12,406
calling out everyone
who said you wouldn't succeed?

562
00:24:12,475 --> 00:24:14,542
I told them all
they would rue the day.

563
00:24:14,611 --> 00:24:17,411
How is it gonna make me look
if the day finally comes,

564
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:19,080
and they're not filled with rue?

565
00:24:19,148 --> 00:24:21,816
Sheldon, this isn't about ruing.

566
00:24:21,884 --> 00:24:23,551
This is about...

567
00:24:23,620 --> 00:24:25,820
humbly accepting
a great honor.

568
00:24:25,888 --> 00:24:28,556
Amy, we won the Nobel
Prize in Physics.

569
00:24:28,625 --> 00:24:31,459
Humility is for people
who win the goofy Nobels

570
00:24:31,527 --> 00:24:34,729
like Literature,
Economics and Peace.

571
00:24:34,797 --> 00:24:37,331
Please tell me that's
not in your speech.

572
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:40,801
Oh. I can cut it,
but it's the only joke I have.

573
00:24:43,806 --> 00:24:46,907
All right, bagels down.
Before we head to the airport,

574
00:24:46,976 --> 00:24:48,309
I'd like to go over
a few things.

575
00:24:50,079 --> 00:24:52,380
From the moment we
step off the plane,

576
00:24:52,448 --> 00:24:54,849
each and every one of you
is an ambassador

577
00:24:54,917 --> 00:24:56,350
for Amy and myself.

578
00:24:56,419 --> 00:24:59,120
I told you
these tickets weren't free.

579
00:24:59,188 --> 00:25:02,690
As such, your behavior must
reflect the highest standards.

580
00:25:02,759 --> 00:25:05,559
Uh, Raj. Bagel down.

581
00:25:05,628 --> 00:25:09,397
If my blood sugar drops
and I get bitchy, it's on you.

582
00:25:09,465 --> 00:25:11,299
Amy, why don't you
kick us off.

583
00:25:11,367 --> 00:25:12,533
Thank you.

584
00:25:12,602 --> 00:25:14,902
"The challenging
climate of Scandinavia

585
00:25:14,971 --> 00:25:17,772
"has left its mark on
the Swedish character.

"These dour,
latter-day Vikings

00:25:20,877 --> 00:25:22,777

00:25:22,845 --> 00:25:24,812
"but if you follow

Yes, you're all encouraged
to pair off and practice this

00:25:46,536 --> 00:25:49,437
once we're in the air
and the seat belt sign is off.

600
00:25:49,505 --> 00:25:51,238
Yes, Penny?
Oh.

601
00:25:51,307 --> 00:25:53,040
Do we have to go?

602
00:25:54,944 --> 00:25:57,044
Yes. And a reminder, Penny,
there's free alcohol

603
00:25:57,113 --> 00:25:58,913
in business class--
don't abuse it.

604
00:25:58,981 --> 00:26:00,548
Relax. I'm not gonna drink.

605
00:26:00,616 --> 00:26:03,417
Why? You pregnant?
Wha...? No.

606
00:26:03,486 --> 00:26:04,719
No, I just, you know,

607
00:26:04,787 --> 00:26:07,088
I don't like to
drink when I fly.

608
00:26:07,156 --> 00:26:09,657
Please. I've seen you
drink in the shower.

609
00:26:12,428 --> 00:26:14,128
You guys have
showered together?

610
00:26:18,868 --> 00:26:20,701
Sometimes
you're just...

611
00:26:20,770 --> 00:26:22,436
ech.

612
00:26:23,539 --> 00:26:25,740
That wasn't a no.

613
00:26:25,808 --> 00:26:26,941
All right,

614
00:26:27,009 --> 00:26:28,849
well, we should head out now
if we're gonna get

615
00:26:28,878 --> 00:26:30,611
to the airport
six hours before boarding.

616
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:33,381
Excuse me. Hello?
What did we

617
00:26:33,449 --> 00:26:35,816
just learn about the end
of business meetings?

618
00:26:35,885 --> 00:26:37,284
Oh, my God.

619
00:26:39,622 --> 00:26:42,056
Yeah, great. Whatever. Uh-huh.

620
00:26:43,526 --> 00:26:44,992
Go on.

621
00:26:45,061 --> 00:26:46,660
You first. Go.

622
00:26:48,631 --> 00:26:49,764
Wait.

623
00:26:49,832 --> 00:26:51,031
Help me!
Oh.

624
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:53,401
Help me!
Oh, wait. Come here.

625
00:26:53,469 --> 00:26:54,780
- We got this.
- Yeah, get in, get in, get in.

626
00:26:57,006 --> 00:26:58,305
Hang on.

627
00:26:58,374 --> 00:27:00,107
I've-I've got an idea.

628
00:27:05,882 --> 00:27:08,582
Well done. You know,
you're proving to be

629
00:27:08,651 --> 00:27:11,385
an invaluable part
of my entourage.

630
00:27:11,454 --> 00:27:12,653
Cool.

631
00:27:24,934 --> 00:27:26,167
Yeah?

632
00:27:26,235 --> 00:27:28,202
- How you doing?
- Fine. Why?

633
00:27:28,271 --> 00:27:31,338
Well, this is the furthest we've
ever been away from the kids.

634
00:27:31,407 --> 00:27:34,008
I was just checking to see
if you're okay.

635
00:27:34,076 --> 00:27:37,344
I'm on my second Jack Reacher.
I'm doing great.

636
00:27:37,413 --> 00:27:38,612
Good. Me, too.

637
00:27:38,681 --> 00:27:40,014
I was just looking
at the map.

638
00:27:40,082 --> 00:27:41,482
Couldn't help
thinking: we're here

639
00:27:41,551 --> 00:27:44,185
and they're there, and
if anything happened,

640
00:27:44,253 --> 00:27:47,888
we'd have to go here to get
all the way back there.

641
00:27:47,957 --> 00:27:49,890
Why are you trying
to freak me out?

642
00:27:49,959 --> 00:27:51,025
This is our vacation.

643
00:27:51,093 --> 00:27:54,161
I thought we should
do things together.

644
00:27:54,230 --> 00:27:56,197
Howard, the kids are okay.

645
00:27:56,265 --> 00:27:57,198
How do you know that?

646
00:27:57,266 --> 00:27:59,633
I just know.
A mother knows.

647
00:27:59,702 --> 00:28:03,037
So what,
now the Force is with you?

648
00:28:03,105 --> 00:28:04,438
Let's see.

649
00:28:04,507 --> 00:28:07,608
This is not the woman
you want to annoy.

650
00:28:09,479 --> 00:28:11,312
- Howard. Howard.
- What?

651
00:28:11,380 --> 00:28:14,048
You see the woman
sitting next to me?

652
00:28:14,116 --> 00:28:15,549
What about her?

653
00:28:15,618 --> 00:28:17,151
Is this her?

654
00:28:18,788 --> 00:28:21,288
Buffy the Vampire Slayer?

655
00:28:21,357 --> 00:28:22,957
Shh! Be cool.

656
00:28:25,027 --> 00:28:27,194
- No, that's not her.
- Okay.

657
00:28:27,263 --> 00:28:29,196
How about now?

658
00:28:32,869 --> 00:28:34,535
Uh-oh.

659
00:28:39,742 --> 00:28:42,109
That's the fourth time
she's been to the bathroom

660
00:28:42,178 --> 00:28:43,744
in the last two hours.

661
00:28:43,813 --> 00:28:45,579
So?

662
00:28:45,648 --> 00:28:48,749
Her breakfast was binding.
I made sure of that.

663
00:28:49,819 --> 00:28:52,219
- So?
- So she clearly has

664
00:28:52,288 --> 00:28:53,721
some sort of
stomach distress.

665
00:28:53,789 --> 00:28:55,589
If it's viral, we're
all susceptible.

666
00:28:55,658 --> 00:28:57,491
She's probably just airsick.

667
00:28:57,560 --> 00:28:59,360
Yeah, but what
if she's not?

668
00:28:59,428 --> 00:29:00,828
What if we get
what she has?

669
00:29:00,897 --> 00:29:02,830
What if we infect
the King of Sweden?

670
00:29:02,899 --> 00:29:04,465
That's how wars start.

671
00:29:10,072 --> 00:29:13,307
All right, that's it, this is <i>Outbreak</i>
and she's the monkey.

672
00:29:14,610 --> 00:29:15,976
Wait. Stop.

673
00:29:16,045 --> 00:29:18,712
Be reasonable.

674
00:29:18,781 --> 00:29:20,247
Leonard...

675
00:29:20,316 --> 00:29:22,616
we need to do something
about your wife.

676
00:29:22,685 --> 00:29:24,229
- What's the matter?
- She is clearly sick,

677
00:29:24,253 --> 00:29:25,388
and she's gonna take us
all down with her.

678
00:29:25,412 --> 00:29:26,988
She's not sick, Sheldon.

679
00:29:26,989 --> 00:29:28,355
She is, and I'm
gonna catch it,

680
00:29:28,424 --> 00:29:30,457
and it's gonna ruin
the greatest day of my life.

681
00:29:30,526 --> 00:29:33,360
I promise you're not going
to get what she has.

682
00:29:33,429 --> 00:29:34,495
What's going on?

683
00:29:34,564 --> 00:29:36,530
Unclean! Unclean!

684
00:29:36,599 --> 00:29:38,065
What?

685
00:29:38,134 --> 00:29:39,633
He thinks you're sick.

686
00:29:39,702 --> 00:29:41,035
Oh.

687
00:29:41,103 --> 00:29:42,836
Should we tell him?

688
00:29:42,905 --> 00:29:44,371
Well, if we don't,
he might try

689
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:45,760
and jump out of the plane.
- Yeah.

690
00:29:45,808 --> 00:29:47,308
Doesn't answer my question.

691
00:29:47,376 --> 00:29:49,810
Tell me what?

692
00:29:49,879 --> 00:29:52,413
I'm pregnant, Sheldon.

693
00:29:52,481 --> 00:29:54,782
You're right,
I can't catch that.

694
00:29:59,722 --> 00:30:01,021
Good news, Amy.

695
00:30:01,090 --> 00:30:02,556
She's just pregnant.

696
00:30:08,904 --> 00:30:10,637
Are you kidding me?

697
00:30:10,705 --> 00:30:13,606
You just found out that a woman
who has loved and cared for you

698
00:30:13,675 --> 00:30:16,409
for 12 years is pregnant,
and all you can say is

699
00:30:16,478 --> 00:30:18,745
you're relieved that she's
not gonna get you sick?

700
00:30:18,814 --> 00:30:20,814
There's no need
for a recap.

701
00:30:20,882 --> 00:30:22,248
I was there.

702
00:30:23,985 --> 00:30:26,686
- Why didn't you tell me?
- I didn't tell anybody.

703
00:30:26,755 --> 00:30:28,621
I'm not anybody.
I'm your best friend.

704
00:30:28,690 --> 00:30:30,824
- What's going on?
- She's pregnant.

705
00:30:30,892 --> 00:30:32,125
That's fantastic!

706
00:30:32,194 --> 00:30:34,594
Why didn't you tell me?

707
00:30:34,663 --> 00:30:36,729
She didn't tell
me, either.

708
00:30:36,798 --> 00:30:38,231
But I'm her best friend.

709
00:30:38,300 --> 00:30:41,434
We'll get
into that later.

710
00:30:41,503 --> 00:30:44,103
What happened to "I'm
never gonna have kids"?

711
00:30:44,172 --> 00:30:46,506
It was an accident. I went out
drinking with Sheldon.

712
00:30:46,575 --> 00:30:48,708
Oh, my gosh.

713
00:30:48,777 --> 00:30:51,077
We're sister wives?

714
00:30:51,146 --> 00:30:53,580
No. Then I went home
and slept with Leonard.

715
00:30:53,648 --> 00:30:55,448
- While fantasizing about...
- Leonard.

716
00:30:55,517 --> 00:30:57,684
And a little Idris Elba.

717
00:30:57,752 --> 00:30:59,018
- I mean, ah...
- Oh, yeah.

718
00:31:01,089 --> 00:31:02,589
What would you like me to say?

719
00:31:02,657 --> 00:31:04,257
How about congratulating us?

720
00:31:04,326 --> 00:31:06,259
Are congratulations
even in order?

721
00:31:06,328 --> 00:31:08,228
I didn't think
Penny wanted children.

722
00:31:08,296 --> 00:31:10,374
Well, she didn't, now she
does. And just so you know,

723
00:31:10,398 --> 00:31:11,509
we weren't gonna tell anybody

724
00:31:11,533 --> 00:31:13,399
so we wouldn't
upstage your big day.

725
00:31:13,468 --> 00:31:15,535
Oh, please,
you couldn't upstage us.

726
00:31:15,604 --> 00:31:16,836
We won a Nobel Prize.

727
00:31:16,905 --> 00:31:18,605
Any idiot can have a baby.

728
00:31:18,673 --> 00:31:20,139
Hey. What's going on?

729
00:31:20,208 --> 00:31:21,708
Case in point.

730
00:31:23,778 --> 00:31:25,745
You are a selfish jerk.

731
00:31:25,814 --> 00:31:27,614
To hell with you and
your Nobel Prize.

732
00:31:30,018 --> 00:31:31,851
I found her boarding pass
in her purse.

733
00:31:31,887 --> 00:31:33,119
It's totally her.

734
00:31:36,992 --> 00:31:38,725
Hi, Stuart, just checking in.

735
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:40,360
Seeing if everything's okay.

736
00:31:40,395 --> 00:31:42,762
Oh, yeah, we're having fun.

737
00:31:42,831 --> 00:31:46,633
Me, Halley and Denise
played hide-and-seek all day.

738
00:31:46,701 --> 00:31:48,801
- Oh, that's nice.
- Yeah.

739
00:31:48,870 --> 00:31:51,271
I found Denise right away.

740
00:31:52,340 --> 00:31:54,574
Where was Halley hiding?

741
00:31:54,643 --> 00:31:58,678
Uh, the important thing
is she's not there now.

742
00:31:58,747 --> 00:32:01,114
Okay, so, everyone's
happy and healthy?

743
00:32:01,182 --> 00:32:02,749
Well, that depends.

744
00:32:02,817 --> 00:32:03,917
What's that mean?

745
00:32:03,985 --> 00:32:05,885
Uh, how many teeth

746
00:32:05,954 --> 00:32:08,121
did Halley have when you left?

747
00:32:08,189 --> 00:32:09,956
All of them.

748
00:32:10,025 --> 00:32:14,127
Oh, yeah, that's-that's
what I was afraid of.

749
00:32:14,195 --> 00:32:15,528
What happened?

750
00:32:15,597 --> 00:32:17,196
Um, well, all right.

751
00:32:17,265 --> 00:32:20,300
Um, Michael had a little fever
last night.

752
00:32:20,368 --> 00:32:21,768
Michael had a fever?

753
00:32:21,836 --> 00:32:23,703
Do you want to hear about Halley
or not?

754
00:32:23,772 --> 00:32:25,171
What happened, Stuart?

755
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:27,974
He was running a little fever,
nothing to worry about.

756
00:32:28,043 --> 00:32:30,343
And Halley, bless her heart,

757
00:32:30,412 --> 00:32:32,211
wanted to bring him
his boo-boo bear,

758
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:34,614
so she climbed
over the safety rail

759
00:32:34,683 --> 00:32:38,217
and took a little tumble
down the stairs.

760
00:32:38,286 --> 00:32:40,386
She fell down the stairs?!

761
00:32:40,455 --> 00:32:43,222
She rolled down the stairs,

762
00:32:43,291 --> 00:32:45,358
laughing the whole time.

763
00:32:45,427 --> 00:32:46,926
Anyway,
when she got to the bottom,

764
00:32:46,995 --> 00:32:49,228
there was a tooth missing.

765
00:32:49,297 --> 00:32:50,297
Oh, Stuart!

766
00:32:50,332 --> 00:32:51,531
She's fine!

767
00:32:51,599 --> 00:32:53,900
She thought it was funny.

768
00:32:53,969 --> 00:32:56,502
Did you at least save
it for the tooth fairy?

769
00:32:56,571 --> 00:32:58,504
No, we couldn't find it.

770
00:32:58,573 --> 00:33:00,173
We have a theory

771
00:33:00,241 --> 00:33:01,641
about where it is,
but it'll take

772
00:33:01,710 --> 00:33:04,677
six to eight hours to confirm.

773
00:33:04,746 --> 00:33:06,679
Speaking of which,

774
00:33:06,748 --> 00:33:09,849
where do you keep
the spaghetti strainer?

775
00:33:13,421 --> 00:33:15,621
Come on, you didn't
seriously expect him to react

776
00:33:15,690 --> 00:33:17,023
like a normal human being.

777
00:33:17,092 --> 00:33:18,591
No, but still,

778
00:33:18,660 --> 00:33:20,593
a-after all these years,

779
00:33:20,662 --> 00:33:22,062
after all the crap
I've put up with,

780
00:33:22,097 --> 00:33:23,563
you'd think just this once

781
00:33:23,631 --> 00:33:25,665
he'd care
about someone else's feelings.

782
00:33:25,734 --> 00:33:27,533
- Oh, my God!
- What?

783
00:33:27,602 --> 00:33:29,936
Pickled herring.
Who knew how good it was!

784
00:33:30,005 --> 00:33:31,537
Really?

785
00:33:31,606 --> 00:33:33,873
Sounds gross.
Looks gross. Smells gross.

786
00:33:33,942 --> 00:33:36,209
It's delicious!

787
00:33:37,512 --> 00:33:40,913
Ooh, that might
be my salted cod!

788
00:33:43,318 --> 00:33:44,450
What?

789
00:33:44,519 --> 00:33:46,853
Sheldon has something
he'd like to say.

790
00:33:46,921 --> 00:33:48,221
I'm sorry I didn't

791
00:33:48,289 --> 00:33:49,455
react appropriately.

792
00:33:49,524 --> 00:33:51,524
You and Penny are bringing
new life into the world.

793
00:33:51,559 --> 00:33:53,593
Congratulations. I
can't wait to meet it.

794
00:33:53,661 --> 00:33:55,962
- "It"?
- That's a gender-neutral pronoun.

795
00:33:56,031 --> 00:33:58,564
If you're offended, take it
up with the English language.

796
00:33:59,601 --> 00:34:02,101
Oh, good, you're here.
Listen,

797
00:34:02,170 --> 00:34:05,471
we're thinking
maybe we should go back to L.A.

798
00:34:05,540 --> 00:34:06,773
- Why?
- We just can't

799
00:34:06,841 --> 00:34:08,081
be this far away from the kids.

800
00:34:08,109 --> 00:34:10,109
Bernie's having a meltdown,

801
00:34:10,178 --> 00:34:11,944
- and, frankly, so am I.
- Yeah, well,

802
00:34:12,013 --> 00:34:14,013
pull it together. This
is a big day for me.

803
00:34:15,483 --> 00:34:19,018
Yeah,
I wasn't sure what to do.

804
00:34:19,087 --> 00:34:21,809
Now I am. We're going home.

805
00:34:21,810 --> 00:34:22,820
- We'll join you.
- Oh, wait.

806
00:34:22,821 --> 00:34:23,824
Do I get a vote in this?

807
00:34:23,848 --> 00:34:25,579
They'll have pickled herring
on the plane.

808
00:34:25,580 --> 00:34:26,712
Bye-bye.

809
00:34:29,417 --> 00:34:31,217
Well, I hate to say it,

810
00:34:31,286 --> 00:34:34,420
but I think everyone
is being incredibly selfish.

811
00:34:34,489 --> 00:34:38,724
Well, you would be the authority
on the subject.

812
00:34:39,828 --> 00:34:41,060
What does that mean?

813
00:34:42,163 --> 00:34:45,064
Sheldon,
no one is happier than I am

814
00:34:45,133 --> 00:34:46,732
to win the Nobel.

815
00:34:46,801 --> 00:34:49,869
But it's not more important
than our friends.

816
00:34:49,938 --> 00:34:53,940
How can you call them friends
when they're abandoning us?

817
00:34:54,008 --> 00:34:55,575
They're abandoning us

818
00:34:55,643 --> 00:34:57,877
because you broke
their hearts.

819
00:35:00,982 --> 00:35:03,082
- I didn't mean to.
- I know!

820
00:35:03,151 --> 00:35:05,985
You never mean to.

821
00:35:07,088 --> 00:35:08,254
That's the only reason

822
00:35:08,323 --> 00:35:10,022
people tolerate you!

823
00:35:12,126 --> 00:35:13,726
Does that include you?

824
00:35:15,797 --> 00:35:18,231
Sometimes, yeah.

825
00:35:27,942 --> 00:35:30,977
Okay, that's it for the fish.

826
00:35:31,079 --> 00:35:32,089
We'll be back with the meatballs

827
00:35:32,113 --> 00:35:34,480
after a short word
from our sponsor.

828
00:35:34,515 --> 00:35:37,083
Oh, thank you.

829
00:35:39,687 --> 00:35:42,355
Leonard, I can't go home.

830
00:35:42,423 --> 00:35:44,924
- I have to be there for Amy.
- Yeah.

831
00:35:44,993 --> 00:35:46,826
I was thinking that, too.

832
00:35:46,895 --> 00:35:48,494
As angry as I am at Sheldon,

833
00:35:48,563 --> 00:35:50,830
I still want to see him win
that medal.

834
00:35:50,899 --> 00:35:52,398
It's so strange.

835
00:35:52,467 --> 00:35:55,835
No matter how thoughtless
and selfish he is,

836
00:35:55,904 --> 00:35:58,237
I still love him.

837
00:35:58,306 --> 00:35:59,639
If you think about it,

838
00:35:59,707 --> 00:36:02,108
he has kind of been
our practice kid.

839
00:36:03,177 --> 00:36:05,077
Like when you make pancakes

840
00:36:05,146 --> 00:36:08,247
and the first one
comes out a little wonky.

841
00:36:08,316 --> 00:36:11,484
The university prefers "quirky."

842
00:36:15,757 --> 00:36:16,989
Hello.

843
00:36:17,058 --> 00:36:18,257
Hey. It's Howard.

844
00:36:19,427 --> 00:36:20,993
Oh, us, too.

845
00:36:21,062 --> 00:36:23,095
- Wait, what?
- They're gonna stay.

846
00:36:23,164 --> 00:36:25,631
The kids are fine.
Bernie's parents took over.

847
00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:27,366
Really?

848
00:36:27,435 --> 00:36:29,468
Oh, poor little guy.

849
00:36:29,537 --> 00:36:30,703
Is Michael okay?

850
00:36:30,772 --> 00:36:31,871
Yeah, it's Stuart.

851
00:36:31,940 --> 00:36:33,620
Bernie's dad gave him a hug,
cracked a rib.

852
00:36:36,511 --> 00:36:38,110
Yeah. Okay,
we'll meet you in the lobby.

853
00:36:42,617 --> 00:36:44,228
How long is it gonna take you
to get ready?

854
00:36:44,252 --> 00:36:46,852
Oh, I just need, like,
five or ten minutes.

855
00:36:46,921 --> 00:36:49,855
- Really?
- No. What is wrong with you?!

856
00:36:52,293 --> 00:36:54,961
And in the field of physics,

857
00:36:55,029 --> 00:36:57,330
Dr. Amy Farrah Fowler

858
00:36:57,398 --> 00:36:59,565
and Dr. Sheldon Cooper

859
00:36:59,634 --> 00:37:02,601
for their discovery
of super-asymmetry.

860
00:37:14,215 --> 00:37:16,749
Just to be clear,
this isn't a date.

861
00:37:16,818 --> 00:37:18,184
Yeah, I know.

862
00:37:18,252 --> 00:37:20,653
Then why are you
holding my hand?

863
00:37:22,724 --> 00:37:24,690
Thank you, your majesties.

864
00:37:24,759 --> 00:37:27,326
Thank you
to the Nobel Committee.

865
00:37:27,395 --> 00:37:29,996
We are deeply honored.

866
00:37:31,165 --> 00:37:33,165
I would just like
to take this moment

867
00:37:33,234 --> 00:37:35,434
to say to all the young girls
out there

868
00:37:35,503 --> 00:37:38,904
who dream about science
as a profession:

869
00:37:38,973 --> 00:37:40,539
go for it.

870
00:37:40,608 --> 00:37:43,242
It is the greatest job

871
00:37:43,311 --> 00:37:45,878
in the world.

872
00:37:45,947 --> 00:37:49,482
And if anybody tells you
you can't, don't listen.

873
00:37:52,286 --> 00:37:54,220
And now,

874
00:37:54,288 --> 00:37:57,390
speaking of not listening,

875
00:37:57,458 --> 00:37:59,859
my husband,
Dr. Sheldon Cooper.

876
00:38:00,962 --> 00:38:02,261
Sheldon.

877
00:38:03,364 --> 00:38:05,765
What? Did you finish? Great job.

878
00:38:08,469 --> 00:38:10,403
Thank you, Dr. Fowler.

879
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:14,573
I have a very long

880
00:38:14,642 --> 00:38:18,110
and somewhat self-centered
speech here.

881
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:21,313
But I'd like to set it aside.

882
00:38:21,382 --> 00:38:22,526
- Yeah!
- Way to go!

883
00:38:27,455 --> 00:38:31,390
Because this honor
doesn't just belong to me.

884
00:38:32,827 --> 00:38:34,760
I wouldn't be up here
if it weren't

885
00:38:34,829 --> 00:38:38,230
for some very important people
in my life.

886
00:38:38,299 --> 00:38:42,668
Beginning with my mother,
father, meemaw,

887
00:38:42,737 --> 00:38:45,171
brother and sister.

888
00:38:47,241 --> 00:38:49,575
And my other family,

889
00:38:49,644 --> 00:38:52,044
who I'm so happy
to have here with us.

890
00:38:53,147 --> 00:38:55,614
Is that Buffy the
Vampire Slayer?

891
00:39:02,090 --> 00:39:04,490
I was under a misapprehension

892
00:39:04,559 --> 00:39:08,227
that my accomplishments
were mine alone.

893
00:39:10,331 --> 00:39:12,264
Nothing could be further
from the truth.

894
00:39:13,367 --> 00:39:15,534
I have been

895
00:39:15,603 --> 00:39:18,204
encouraged, sustained,

896
00:39:18,272 --> 00:39:21,841
inspired and tolerated

897
00:39:21,909 --> 00:39:25,111
not only by my wife,

898
00:39:25,179 --> 00:39:28,147
but by the greatest group
of friends anyone ever had.

899
00:39:30,852 --> 00:39:33,619
I'd like to ask them to stand.

900
00:39:35,423 --> 00:39:37,456
Dr. Rajesh Koothrappali.

901
00:39:41,462 --> 00:39:44,096
Dr. Bernadette
Rostenkowski Wolowitz.

902
00:39:48,035 --> 00:39:50,469
Astronaut Howard Wolowitz.

903
00:39:54,442 --> 00:39:58,577
And my two dearest friends
in the world,

904
00:39:58,646 --> 00:40:00,679
Penny Hofstadter...

905
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:08,354
...and Dr. Leonard Hofstadter.

906
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:15,694
I was there the moment
Leonard and Penny met.

907
00:40:15,763 --> 00:40:19,899
He said to me that their babies
would be smart <i>and</i> beautiful.

908
00:40:21,969 --> 00:40:23,903
And now that they're expecting,

909
00:40:23,971 --> 00:40:26,172
I have no doubt that
that will be the case.

910
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:29,241
Thanks, Sheldon. I-I haven't
told my parents yet, but thanks.

911
00:40:30,745 --> 00:40:33,746
Oh. I'm sorry.

912
00:40:34,849 --> 00:40:36,315
Don't tell anyone
that last thing.

913
00:40:36,384 --> 00:40:38,250
That's a secret.

914
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:42,021
Howard, Bernadette,

915
00:40:42,089 --> 00:40:46,292
Raj, Penny, Leonard,

916
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:50,329
I apologize if I haven't
been the friend you deserve.

917
00:40:51,432 --> 00:40:53,265
But I want you to know

918
00:40:53,334 --> 00:40:56,869
in my way,

919
00:40:56,938 --> 00:40:59,438
I love you all.

920
00:41:02,810 --> 00:41:04,176
And I love you.

921
00:41:08,115 --> 00:41:09,648
Thank you.

922
00:41:22,608 --> 00:41:27,177
? Our whole universe
was in a hot, dense state ?

923
00:41:27,246 --> 00:41:30,214
? Then nearly
14 billion years ago ?

924
00:41:30,283 --> 00:41:33,450
? Expansion started... Wait ?

925
00:41:33,519 --> 00:41:36,020
? The Earth began to cool ?

926
00:41:36,088 --> 00:41:40,558
? The autotrophs began to drool,
Neanderthals developed tools ?

927
00:41:40,626 --> 00:41:44,194
? We built a Wall,
we built the pyramids ?

928
00:41:44,263 --> 00:41:46,830
? Math, Science, History ?

929
00:41:46,899 --> 00:41:49,967
? Unraveling the mystery ?

930
00:41:50,036 --> 00:41:54,972
? That all started
with a big bang. ?

931
00:41:57,176 --> 00:42:04,176
