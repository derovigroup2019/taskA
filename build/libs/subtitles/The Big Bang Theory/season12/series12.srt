<i>Previously on</i>
The Big Bang Theory...

2
00:00:01,884 --> 00:00:04,079
So I told my mom
she just needed to back off.

3
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:05,996
This is our wedding,
and if anyone's gonna

4
00:00:05,997 --> 00:00:09,432
design the floral arrangements,
it's going to be my man.

5
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:11,467
Thank you.

6
00:00:11,956 --> 00:00:14,189
I mean, I-I'm not trying
to be a Groomzilla,

7
00:00:14,258 --> 00:00:16,692
but... this is my specialty.

8
00:00:19,864 --> 00:00:21,278
Everything okay?

9
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:22,945
Yeah, it's just
Anu's doorbell camera.

10
00:00:23,014 --> 00:00:24,480
I helped her install it.

11
00:00:24,549 --> 00:00:26,282
You can't look at it.
That's spying.

12
00:00:26,351 --> 00:00:27,650
Who the hell is this guy?

13
00:00:27,719 --> 00:00:28,751
Ooh, let me see.

14
00:00:30,622 --> 00:00:32,588
So you're still talking
to your ex-boyfriend?

15
00:00:32,657 --> 00:00:34,490
Yes, and I'm not gonna
apologize for that.

16
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:36,826
And you need to delete
that app from your phone.

17
00:00:36,894 --> 00:00:38,461
Because you're hiding
something from me?

18
00:00:38,529 --> 00:00:39,996
No, because you
should trust me!

19
00:00:40,064 --> 00:00:43,099
How can I trust you?!
I barely even know you!

20
00:00:43,167 --> 00:00:44,834
Then what are we doing?

21
00:00:44,902 --> 00:00:46,469
I don't know.

22
00:00:48,806 --> 00:00:50,239
- Oh!
- Aah,

23
00:00:50,308 --> 00:00:52,041
sad man!

24
00:00:54,245 --> 00:00:55,711
This is so great.

25
00:00:55,780 --> 00:00:57,146
Why don't we do it
more often?

26
00:00:57,215 --> 00:00:58,981
Because you have two kids,

27
00:00:59,050 --> 00:01:00,249
I have Sheldon,

28
00:01:00,318 --> 00:01:02,184
and Penny's apparently
in the gym all the time,

29
00:01:02,253 --> 00:01:04,086
'cause damn, look at her!

30
00:01:05,323 --> 00:01:06,822
Yeah, so impressive
how you manage

31
00:01:06,891 --> 00:01:09,292
to bounce back
after having no babies.

32
00:01:10,662 --> 00:01:12,962
Ah, another reason why
we don't do this more often.

33
00:01:14,399 --> 00:01:16,599
You've come
to a giant metal door.

34
00:01:16,668 --> 00:01:20,102
I check the door
for traps.

35
00:01:20,171 --> 00:01:22,104
There are no traps.

36
00:01:22,173 --> 00:01:23,306
I use my wizard eye

37
00:01:23,374 --> 00:01:25,741
to see what's on the
other side of the door.

38
00:01:25,810 --> 00:01:28,344
Hey, that's sort of like how
you used a doorbell camera

39
00:01:28,413 --> 00:01:31,080
to spy on your fianc?e.

40
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:34,050
No, it's nothing like that.

41
00:01:34,118 --> 00:01:36,018
Your wizard eye
reveals a monster.

42
00:01:36,087 --> 00:01:38,554
- Oh. Is it alone and unloved?
- I guess.

43
00:01:38,623 --> 00:01:41,590
I open the door and say,
"Hey, Raj."

44
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:44,894
I have a bottle
of champagne for you.

45
00:01:44,962 --> 00:01:46,462
Oh, we didn't order this.

46
00:01:46,531 --> 00:01:48,931
It's from the gentleman
at the end of the bar.

47
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,534
Oh. Well, if we drink it,
does that mean

48
00:01:51,602 --> 00:01:53,102
we're making a promise?

49
00:01:53,171 --> 00:01:56,072
'Cause I am happily married,
although I will watch.

50
00:01:57,442 --> 00:01:59,575
We're not gonna do anything.

51
00:01:59,644 --> 00:02:02,278
Really?
So all that work's for Leonard?

52
00:02:04,349 --> 00:02:06,182
Why don't you just
call her? I'm sure

53
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:07,483
you guys can work this out.

54
00:02:07,552 --> 00:02:09,263
I don't want to talk about it.
Let's just play.

55
00:02:09,287 --> 00:02:10,486
Okay, the cyclops tells you

56
00:02:10,555 --> 00:02:12,254
that the enchantress
you seek is staying

57
00:02:12,323 --> 00:02:14,123
at the Inn of the Dwarven Lords.

58
00:02:14,192 --> 00:02:16,158
Really? An inn?

59
00:02:16,227 --> 00:02:17,993
Anu is a concierge at a hotel.

60
00:02:18,062 --> 00:02:19,106
That's a little insensitive,

61
00:02:19,130 --> 00:02:20,496
don't you think?

62
00:02:20,565 --> 00:02:23,032
I hadn't noticed that
before you mentioned it.

63
00:02:23,101 --> 00:02:24,808
Well, now that I've
mentioned it, how do you feel?

64
00:02:24,832 --> 00:02:25,402
Bad.

65
00:02:25,403 --> 00:02:27,069
Shame on you.

66
00:02:27,138 --> 00:02:29,238
- Hey, ladies.
- Zack!

67
00:02:29,307 --> 00:02:30,606
Hi. You guys
know Zack.

68
00:02:30,675 --> 00:02:31,841
- Yeah.
- Of course.

69
00:02:31,909 --> 00:02:33,342
Did-did you
send this over?

70
00:02:33,411 --> 00:02:36,011
I did. I asked for the
most expensive one they have.

71
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,513
They said it was $200,

72
00:02:37,582 --> 00:02:39,815
and I said
I want a <i>more</i> expensive one.

73
00:02:39,884 --> 00:02:43,219
And then, they said it was $300.

74
00:02:45,623 --> 00:02:47,223
But it-it was the same...

75
00:02:47,291 --> 00:02:49,358
Don't.

76
00:02:49,427 --> 00:02:51,887
Thank you, but you shouldn't
have spent so much.

77
00:02:51,911 --> 00:02:52,596
Nah.

78
00:02:52,597 --> 00:02:55,731
It's cool. I sold my company
for a boatload of money.

79
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,233
And then I bought a boat.

80
00:02:58,336 --> 00:02:59,802
Then I got married.

81
00:02:59,871 --> 00:03:01,270
Guess where.

82
00:03:01,339 --> 00:03:02,805
On your boat?

83
00:03:02,874 --> 00:03:05,941
No, but that would've
been awesome!

84
00:03:07,044 --> 00:03:09,545
Well, congratulations.

85
00:03:09,614 --> 00:03:11,213
Hey, you and Leonard

86
00:03:11,282 --> 00:03:13,816
should come over and have
dinner with us on our boat.

87
00:03:13,885 --> 00:03:16,485
Yeah, that would be so nice.

88
00:03:16,554 --> 00:03:19,355
Leonard was just saying
how he was hoping to have dinner

89
00:03:19,424 --> 00:03:22,158
with one of your ex-boyfriends
on his expensive boat.

90
00:03:24,162 --> 00:03:25,773
- Well, then this worked out perfect!
- Oh, yeah.

Hey. How was game night?

102
00:03:55,126 --> 00:03:56,893
Oh, off the charts.

103
00:03:56,962 --> 00:03:58,828
Literally.
Sheldon rolled a number so high,

104
00:03:58,897 --> 00:04:00,830
it wasn't on any
of these charts.

105
00:04:00,899 --> 00:04:02,465
That's funny.

106
00:04:02,534 --> 00:04:04,167
Wow. I should not have
driven home.

107
00:04:06,538 --> 00:04:07,837
How was ladies' night?

108
00:04:07,906 --> 00:04:10,373
It was fun. Amy got drunk
and kept telling us

109
00:04:10,442 --> 00:04:14,277
that Sheldon's chest is smooth
like a porpoise.

110
00:04:14,346 --> 00:04:17,246
Well, it does squeak
when you touch it.

111
00:04:17,315 --> 00:04:19,315
And we ran into Zack.

112
00:04:19,384 --> 00:04:21,384
Oh. Yeah? How's he doing?

113
00:04:21,453 --> 00:04:23,786
- He got married.
- Oh. Well, that's nice.

114
00:04:23,855 --> 00:04:27,023
Yeah, and he sold his company
for a fortune and retired.

115
00:04:27,092 --> 00:04:29,025
Huh.

116
00:04:30,762 --> 00:04:33,863
And you ended up with me,
so everybody wins.

117
00:04:33,932 --> 00:04:36,833
Wait. You're not
jealous of Zack, are you?

118
00:04:36,901 --> 00:04:38,801
What? Oh, absolutely not.

119
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:40,757
In fact, he should be jealous
of me because I have you.

120
00:04:40,781 --> 00:04:41,205
Oh.

121
00:04:41,206 --> 00:04:44,207
And a dungeon with over 30 rooms
left unexplored

122
00:04:44,275 --> 00:04:46,376
because no one thought
to search for secret doors

123
00:04:46,444 --> 00:04:48,478
under the wizard's throne.

124
00:04:48,546 --> 00:04:51,247
Oh. You know, I'd
like to go exploring.

125
00:04:51,316 --> 00:04:53,816
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

126
00:04:53,885 --> 00:04:55,418
Well, I'll get the dice
back out.

127
00:05:05,663 --> 00:05:08,297
Go away, Raj!

128
00:05:11,503 --> 00:05:13,636
What are you doing?

129
00:05:13,705 --> 00:05:16,439
I'm winning you back
<i>Love Actually</i> style.

130
00:05:22,313 --> 00:05:23,713
I don't know what that means.

131
00:05:23,782 --> 00:05:26,682
Really? You've never
seen <i>Love Actually?</i>

132
00:05:26,751 --> 00:05:30,053
If you want to watch it
right now, I'll just wait.

133
00:05:31,689 --> 00:05:33,656
I have nothing to say to you.

134
00:05:33,725 --> 00:05:35,591
Look, we both made mistakes.

135
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:38,561
I am so sorry that
I spied on you.

136
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:41,264
I didn't mean to, but
I know it was not okay.

137
00:05:42,934 --> 00:05:45,835
Now, do you want
to apologize to me?

138
00:05:45,904 --> 00:05:49,872
You also said you don't trust me
and that you barely know me.

139
00:05:49,941 --> 00:05:53,276
I really thought this would be
more of a back-and-forth thing.

140
00:05:53,344 --> 00:05:56,846
Honestly, Raj, why do you even
want to marry me?

141
00:05:56,915 --> 00:06:00,683
You know, family
and India and stuff.

142
00:06:00,752 --> 00:06:02,418
Here's what I think.

143
00:06:02,487 --> 00:06:04,087
All of your friends are married,

144
00:06:04,155 --> 00:06:06,122
and you don't want
to be left behind.

145
00:06:06,191 --> 00:06:08,758
And honestly, that's not
a good enough reason.

146
00:06:08,827 --> 00:06:12,528
Uh, okay, well, how
is that different

147
00:06:12,597 --> 00:06:14,530
than what you're doing? Hmm?

148
00:06:14,599 --> 00:06:15,865
Worried that you wasted

149
00:06:15,934 --> 00:06:18,668
so many years dating the
wrong people, and now,

150
00:06:18,736 --> 00:06:20,670
you're just looking
for a shortcut.

151
00:06:22,273 --> 00:06:24,240
You're right.
It's not different.

152
00:06:24,309 --> 00:06:25,441
Okay, so we agree.

153
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:27,510
- Yeah.
- Great.

154
00:06:27,579 --> 00:06:29,345
Wait. What did we
just agree on?

155
00:06:29,414 --> 00:06:33,049
That we shouldn't
see each other anymore.

156
00:06:33,118 --> 00:06:35,118
You know what?

157
00:06:35,186 --> 00:06:38,121
Why don't you shut the door,
and I'll just do the cards?

158
00:06:46,965 --> 00:06:49,732
Uh, do you remember
Penny's ex-boyfriend Zack?

159
00:06:49,801 --> 00:06:52,635
Leonard, I remember all
of Penny's ex-boyfriends.

160
00:06:52,704 --> 00:06:55,338
If you'd like, I could
list them alphabetically.

161
00:06:55,406 --> 00:06:56,906
No, thank you.

162
00:06:56,975 --> 00:06:58,141
Fun fact.
You would think

163
00:06:58,209 --> 00:07:00,276
Zack would be
the last one on the list,

164
00:07:00,345 --> 00:07:03,746
but she also dated two Zekes.

165
00:07:03,815 --> 00:07:06,182
Well, apparently,
Zack sold his company

166
00:07:06,251 --> 00:07:08,084
for a ton of money and retired.

167
00:07:08,153 --> 00:07:09,719
And that bothers you?

168
00:07:09,787 --> 00:07:12,188
I don't know. I mean...

169
00:07:12,257 --> 00:07:13,789
I guess so. Yeah.

170
00:07:13,858 --> 00:07:15,191
It doesn't seem fair.

171
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:17,193
I work hard.

172
00:07:19,998 --> 00:07:21,898
I'm really smart.

173
00:07:25,170 --> 00:07:27,837
I've made substantial
contributions to my field.

174
00:07:30,441 --> 00:07:32,441
But Zack gets to be rich,

175
00:07:32,510 --> 00:07:34,777
while I'm still working
for a paycheck?

176
00:07:34,846 --> 00:07:37,113
Well, a lot of people
you don't know are rich.

177
00:07:37,182 --> 00:07:39,582
That doesn't seem to bother you.
Mark Zuckerberg,

178
00:07:39,651 --> 00:07:41,617
Sultan of Brunei,
Gordon Letwin.

179
00:07:41,686 --> 00:07:42,729
Who's that?

180
00:07:42,753 --> 00:07:44,753
He's one of the first
11 employees of Microsoft.

181
00:07:44,756 --> 00:07:46,122
Yeah, well, I don't

182
00:07:46,191 --> 00:07:48,891
have to hang out with Gordon Letwin.
- Well, that's too bad.

183
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:51,494
He helped create
the HPFS file system.

184
00:07:51,563 --> 00:07:54,030
Oh, the stories he could tell.

185
00:07:54,098 --> 00:07:57,066
Penny told him we'd go have
dinner with him and his wife

186
00:07:57,135 --> 00:07:58,734
on their stupid boat.

187
00:07:58,803 --> 00:08:00,347
Well, just tell her
you don't want to go.

188
00:08:00,371 --> 00:08:03,706
Well, then, she'll think
I'm being jealous and petty.

189
00:08:03,775 --> 00:08:06,342
So you want to seem
mature and confident.

190
00:08:11,883 --> 00:08:15,284
I make one mistake, and she says
she doesn't want to marry me.

191
00:08:15,353 --> 00:08:17,653
- Like she never screwed up.
- Did she?

192
00:08:17,722 --> 00:08:20,756
Well, she agreed to marry me.

193
00:08:20,825 --> 00:08:22,558
Honestly,

194
00:08:22,627 --> 00:08:23,893
I think you dodged a bullet.

195
00:08:23,962 --> 00:08:25,661
I don't think
she was right for you.

196
00:08:25,730 --> 00:08:26,929
Howie, shh.

197
00:08:26,998 --> 00:08:28,030
What?

198
00:08:28,099 --> 00:08:29,265
You can't bad-mouth Anu.

199
00:08:29,334 --> 00:08:30,511
They're gonna
get back together,

200
00:08:30,535 --> 00:08:32,168
and you're gonna look
like a jerk.

201
00:08:32,237 --> 00:08:33,636
I mean, remember

202
00:08:33,705 --> 00:08:36,405
when we broke up, and Penny said
all those mean things about you?

203
00:08:39,644 --> 00:08:42,178
What did she say?

204
00:08:42,247 --> 00:08:43,512
I don't want to get into it.

205
00:08:43,581 --> 00:08:45,314
Some of it was hurtful,
most of it was true.

206
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:50,291
So I'm just supposed
to lie to my friend?

207
00:08:50,315 --> 00:08:52,256
I don't want you to lie to me.

208
00:08:52,257 --> 00:08:53,689
No one's gonna lie to you.

209
00:08:53,758 --> 00:08:55,791
Lie.

210
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:57,760
She says

211
00:08:57,829 --> 00:08:59,006
the only reason I'm marrying her

212
00:08:59,030 --> 00:09:00,207
is because
all my friends are married,

213
00:09:00,231 --> 00:09:01,551
and I don't want
to feel left out.

214
00:09:01,599 --> 00:09:03,745
Oh, that's nonsense.

215
00:09:03,751 --> 00:09:05,434
No.
She's right.

216
00:09:06,537 --> 00:09:08,170
Now what do I say?

217
00:09:10,642 --> 00:09:13,242
So, Marissa, how

218
00:09:13,311 --> 00:09:14,577
did you guys meet?

219
00:09:14,646 --> 00:09:16,712
Oh, it's a pretty
funny story.

220
00:09:16,781 --> 00:09:18,948
We met in a bookstore.

221
00:09:22,053 --> 00:09:23,986
That <i>is</i> funny.

222
00:09:25,223 --> 00:09:27,223
Yeah, I was just there
using the bathroom,

223
00:09:27,292 --> 00:09:30,059
but this one had a stack
of books, like, this tall.

224
00:09:30,128 --> 00:09:31,861
Oh. So, you really like to read?

225
00:09:31,929 --> 00:09:33,863
Oh, no. I work there.

226
00:09:35,099 --> 00:09:36,899
Yeah, she is super smart.

227
00:09:36,968 --> 00:09:39,068
Seriously, you name,
like, any book,

228
00:09:39,137 --> 00:09:40,970
she'll tell you if
she's heard of it.

229
00:09:41,039 --> 00:09:42,805
Go on, try her.

230
00:09:42,874 --> 00:09:43,874
Oh, uh, well, uh...

231
00:09:43,908 --> 00:09:45,041
<i>Catcher in the Rye.</i>

232
00:09:45,109 --> 00:09:46,008
Nope.

233
00:09:46,077 --> 00:09:48,277
Look at that, Penny.

234
00:09:48,346 --> 00:09:50,680
I guess we both like nerds.

235
00:09:51,783 --> 00:09:54,784
So, uh, we gonna
take this thing out?

236
00:09:54,852 --> 00:09:57,620
Nah. It's a little
choppy tonight.

237
00:09:57,689 --> 00:10:00,122
Yeah, that's okay-- this is
nice, sitting under the stars.

238
00:10:00,191 --> 00:10:01,957
It's actually kind of peaceful.

239
00:10:02,026 --> 00:10:04,160
Well, it's a beautiful boat.

240
00:10:04,228 --> 00:10:05,528
Thanks, man.

241
00:10:05,596 --> 00:10:06,796
We love it.

242
00:10:06,864 --> 00:10:08,831
Although, he's so tall
he bangs his head

243
00:10:08,933 --> 00:10:10,533
almost every time
he goes downstairs.

244
00:10:10,601 --> 00:10:13,302
After the first couple,
you don't even feel it.

245
00:10:13,371 --> 00:10:15,104
Where are our manners?

246
00:10:15,173 --> 00:10:17,006
Zack, let's get our guests
something to drink.

247
00:10:17,075 --> 00:10:18,741
Oh, you got it, babe.

248
00:10:18,810 --> 00:10:20,743
I can't believe
that guy's rich.

249
00:10:20,812 --> 00:10:21,977
Ooh, watch your head.

250
00:10:22,046 --> 00:10:23,379
That was a close one.

251
00:10:25,083 --> 00:10:26,181
Are you jealous?

252
00:10:26,205 --> 00:10:27,751
I know, I know,
I shouldn't be.

253
00:10:27,752 --> 00:10:29,885
He's super sweet.
I should be happy for them.

254
00:10:29,954 --> 00:10:31,654
Oh, it's driving
me crazy, too.

255
00:10:31,723 --> 00:10:33,689
- Really?
- Yes. I was trying to pretend

256
00:10:33,758 --> 00:10:35,502
like it wasn't so you
wouldn't think I was petty.

257
00:10:35,526 --> 00:10:38,027
Wha-- turns out
we're both petty.

258
00:10:38,096 --> 00:10:40,296
I love you so much.

259
00:10:40,365 --> 00:10:42,031
Aw.

260
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:43,466
Cheers, guys.

261
00:10:43,534 --> 00:10:45,034
- Aw, thanks.
- Thank you.

262
00:10:46,738 --> 00:10:49,905
So listen, I got
to be honest.

263
00:10:49,974 --> 00:10:53,776
We sort of have another reason
for asking you here.

264
00:10:54,979 --> 00:10:56,412
We want to have a baby,

265
00:10:56,481 --> 00:10:58,760
but we can't do it
on our own.

266
00:10:58,761 --> 00:11:01,717
It could be because of the game me
and my frat brothers used to play

267
00:11:01,786 --> 00:11:04,387
where we kicked each other
in the balls over and over.

268
00:11:05,890 --> 00:11:07,723
But the doc says
there's no telling.

269
00:11:09,227 --> 00:11:11,694
We just don't know.

270
00:11:11,763 --> 00:11:13,829
Huh.

271
00:11:13,898 --> 00:11:16,599
You went to college.

272
00:11:16,667 --> 00:11:19,135
And Zack's
always admired you

273
00:11:19,203 --> 00:11:21,670
because you're
the smartest person he knows.

274
00:11:21,739 --> 00:11:23,072
Okay, whoa, whoa.

275
00:11:23,141 --> 00:11:26,108
Whoa, whoa. You know, this
has been such a nice evening.

276
00:11:26,177 --> 00:11:28,978
Let's all just stop before
anyone says any more things.

277
00:11:29,046 --> 00:11:30,432
Leonard, would you be
the father of our baby?

278
00:11:30,456 --> 00:11:32,422
Aw, you said a thing.

279
00:11:38,279 --> 00:11:40,580
Wow, this is
really flattering.

280
00:11:40,648 --> 00:11:43,883
And also really weird, right?

281
00:11:43,952 --> 00:11:45,318
Oh, just to be clear,

282
00:11:45,386 --> 00:11:48,354
you don't get to...
you know.

283
00:11:48,423 --> 00:11:50,723
No, I...

284
00:11:50,792 --> 00:11:52,491
- I got it.
- Just because I slept

285
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:55,561
with your wife doesn't mean
you get to sleep with mine.

286
00:11:57,165 --> 00:11:58,898
We... we get it,

287
00:11:58,967 --> 00:12:02,501
but... thank you
for saying it out loud.

288
00:12:02,570 --> 00:12:03,936
You're welcome.

289
00:12:05,306 --> 00:12:08,407
I know it's a big ask,
but it would mean so much to us.

290
00:12:08,476 --> 00:12:09,476
Yeah, and we

291
00:12:09,544 --> 00:12:11,677
really don't want
a stranger's, you know...

292
00:12:11,746 --> 00:12:14,680
- I know.
- ...sperm.

293
00:12:14,749 --> 00:12:18,117
And Zack's always talked about
what a great guy Leonard is.

294
00:12:18,186 --> 00:12:19,986
I...

295
00:12:20,054 --> 00:12:22,588
I really
don't know what to say.

296
00:12:22,657 --> 00:12:24,757
Really? You don't know
what to say?

297
00:12:24,826 --> 00:12:27,627
You know, I-I think we
should talk about this.

298
00:12:27,695 --> 00:12:29,962
Oh, yeah. Definitely,
you guys should talk, yeah.

299
00:12:30,031 --> 00:12:31,964
Take your time.

300
00:12:35,370 --> 00:12:37,603
He means privately.

301
00:12:37,672 --> 00:12:38,749
- Right. Sorry.
- Sure. Yep.

302
00:12:38,773 --> 00:12:40,640
- Come on,Zack.
- Okay. Yeah.

303
00:12:40,708 --> 00:12:42,441
Okay.

304
00:12:42,510 --> 00:12:44,270
You really think
those two should be parents?

305
00:12:44,312 --> 00:12:45,978
There's nothing
wrong with them.

306
00:12:46,047 --> 00:12:48,047
Ow!

307
00:12:55,356 --> 00:12:57,290
Hello, Daddy.

308
00:12:57,358 --> 00:13:00,826
Did you install a camera
to spy on your fianc?e?

309
00:13:00,895 --> 00:13:02,028
What?!

310
00:13:02,096 --> 00:13:04,196
No!

311
00:13:04,265 --> 00:13:05,631
That's what her parents told me

312
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:07,700
when they said they
were calling off the wedding.

313
00:13:07,769 --> 00:13:10,770
But I told them you would never
do such a thing.

314
00:13:10,838 --> 00:13:11,838
Thank you.

315
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:14,240
I mean, I did install a camera

316
00:13:14,309 --> 00:13:18,177
and I did spy on her, but I did
not install it <i>to</i> spy on her.

317
00:13:18,246 --> 00:13:20,913
Well, that's not going
to be <i>our</i> story.

318
00:13:20,982 --> 00:13:23,316
Our story is that she's a liar.

319
00:13:23,384 --> 00:13:24,717
And-and old.

320
00:13:24,786 --> 00:13:27,520
An old, dirty liar.

321
00:13:27,588 --> 00:13:29,221
Oh, no.
She's-she's actually great.

322
00:13:29,290 --> 00:13:31,190
I'm the one who screwed up.

323
00:13:31,259 --> 00:13:32,959
Well, don't say that to <i>them.</i>

324
00:13:33,027 --> 00:13:34,660
She's bad. You're good.

325
00:13:34,729 --> 00:13:38,164
They have to pay me back
for my wedding deposits.

326
00:13:38,232 --> 00:13:39,765
This is all my fault.

327
00:13:39,834 --> 00:13:42,034
I should have...
I should have just trusted her.

328
00:13:42,103 --> 00:13:44,370
So you're saying
you still want to get married?

329
00:13:44,439 --> 00:13:46,372
Fine. Then I'll call her parents

330
00:13:46,441 --> 00:13:48,407
and we'll straighten
this whole thing out.

331
00:13:48,476 --> 00:13:50,276
I don't think
she wants to marry me.

332
00:13:50,345 --> 00:13:51,610
And honestly...

333
00:13:51,679 --> 00:13:54,080
she deserves someone better.

334
00:13:54,148 --> 00:13:57,616
Rajesh, you need to stop
being so hard on yourself.

335
00:13:57,685 --> 00:13:59,719
You're a good man.

336
00:13:59,787 --> 00:14:01,253
Wow.

337
00:14:01,322 --> 00:14:03,489
Y-You've never told me that.

338
00:14:03,558 --> 00:14:05,891
You're also a dope.

339
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:08,627
That you've said.

340
00:14:08,696 --> 00:14:10,830
But your heart's
in the right place,

341
00:14:10,898 --> 00:14:12,298
and you deserve happiness.

342
00:14:12,367 --> 00:14:15,167
So you just need to figure out
what you want,

343
00:14:15,236 --> 00:14:18,437
and if that means cancelling the
wedding, we cancel the wedding.

344
00:14:18,506 --> 00:14:20,139
Thank you.

345
00:14:20,208 --> 00:14:22,208
But figure it out quickly,
or I'll be celebrating

346
00:14:22,276 --> 00:14:24,210
my next birthday
with a lot more elephants

347
00:14:24,278 --> 00:14:26,445
and marigolds than I expected.

348
00:14:29,283 --> 00:14:32,284
And Leonard just stood
there with a big, dumb smile on his face,

349
00:14:32,353 --> 00:14:35,287
like he was watching a puppy
and a monkey make friends.

350
00:14:36,657 --> 00:14:39,525
Well, I can see how he'd
be flattered to be asked.

351
00:14:39,594 --> 00:14:40,926
It's not flattering.
It's creepy.

352
00:14:40,995 --> 00:14:43,963
Well, something can be both
flattering <i>and</i> creepy.

353
00:14:44,032 --> 00:14:46,432
You know, just the other night,
Sheldon said that my feet

354
00:14:46,501 --> 00:14:48,601
looked like
Richard Feynman's hands.

355
00:14:48,669 --> 00:14:50,336
Really? So
you'd be okay

356
00:14:50,405 --> 00:14:53,305
if someone wanted to use Sheldon
as their sperm donor?

357
00:14:53,374 --> 00:14:56,375
Oh, absolutely not. I am
the only handmaid in this tale.

358
00:14:59,147 --> 00:15:01,380
So Leonard's
really considering this?

359
00:15:01,449 --> 00:15:02,948
Yes. We got in a
huge fight about it.

360
00:15:03,017 --> 00:15:04,897
He said, well, if I
don't want to have his baby,

361
00:15:04,952 --> 00:15:07,472
then why shouldn't someone else
be able to? Do you believe that?

362
00:15:10,425 --> 00:15:11,891
What?

363
00:15:11,959 --> 00:15:14,727
Well, there is
a deep-seated biological drive

364
00:15:14,796 --> 00:15:16,395
to pass on your genes.

365
00:15:16,464 --> 00:15:18,097
It's only natural.

366
00:15:18,166 --> 00:15:19,665
So you're on his side?

367
00:15:19,734 --> 00:15:21,834
Well, viewing
Leonard as a mammal,

368
00:15:21,903 --> 00:15:23,803
it's perfectly
understandable.

369
00:15:24,939 --> 00:15:26,939
But viewing him
as your husband, he stinks.

370
00:15:27,008 --> 00:15:29,041
And we hate him.

371
00:15:31,546 --> 00:15:34,914
Really? Zack wanted you to donate

372
00:15:34,982 --> 00:15:37,183
your genetic material
for his baby?

373
00:15:37,251 --> 00:15:40,519
Yeah. So I'd be helping out a
couple who really want a baby,

374
00:15:40,588 --> 00:15:43,622
and they were gonna pay us,
and Penny freaked out about it.

375
00:15:43,691 --> 00:15:45,458
- That doesn't make any sense.
- I know.

376
00:15:45,526 --> 00:15:47,560
They wanted <i>you?</i>

377
00:15:49,464 --> 00:15:51,297
Yes, Sheldon,
they wanted me.

378
00:15:51,365 --> 00:15:53,966
I'm smart. I'm nice.
I'm smart. I'm nice.

379
00:15:54,035 --> 00:15:57,670
And I can eat cheese
without clearing out a room.

380
00:15:57,738 --> 00:16:00,039
Are you upset he
didn't ask you?

381
00:16:00,108 --> 00:16:02,208
Of course not. I just
think it's interesting

382
00:16:02,276 --> 00:16:05,311
that of all the people he knows,
he thinks you're the best choice.

383
00:16:05,379 --> 00:16:07,313
Well, he does.

384
00:16:07,381 --> 00:16:09,949
I don't see why Penny
is so against this.

385
00:16:10,017 --> 00:16:12,196
Well, perhaps Penny's worried
that you haven't considered

386
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:14,954
the emotional toll of knowing
there's a child out there

387
00:16:15,022 --> 00:16:17,256
who is biologically yours
but not actually yours.

388
00:16:19,794 --> 00:16:22,161
Wow, that's
really insightful.

389
00:16:22,230 --> 00:16:24,330
Yeah, I'm taller than you
and I don't have asthma.

390
00:16:24,398 --> 00:16:25,731
Those people are crazy.

391
00:16:33,141 --> 00:16:35,841
Come on, I know you're there,
and I know you know it's me.

392
00:16:41,015 --> 00:16:43,549
- You're just making this harder.
- Look...

393
00:16:43,618 --> 00:16:45,317
you were right.

394
00:16:45,386 --> 00:16:47,720
I was doing this for
the wrong reasons.

395
00:16:47,788 --> 00:16:50,556
You deserve to marry
someone who knows

396
00:16:50,625 --> 00:16:53,292
how amazing you are...
and who proposes

397
00:16:53,361 --> 00:16:56,962
because he doesn't want to spend
a single day without you.

398
00:16:57,031 --> 00:17:00,900
Not... not because he wants
to catch up to his friends.

399
00:17:00,968 --> 00:17:03,035
Thank you.

400
00:17:03,104 --> 00:17:07,540
And I want you to know, I
think I could be that man.

401
00:17:07,608 --> 00:17:10,242
Raj, I'm not gonna marry you.

402
00:17:10,311 --> 00:17:12,878
- I'm not asking you to.
- Then why are you here?

403
00:17:12,947 --> 00:17:14,079
Because I like you.

404
00:17:14,148 --> 00:17:15,614
Okay? I like you.

405
00:17:15,683 --> 00:17:17,883
I-I like you enough
to start this relationship

406
00:17:17,952 --> 00:17:20,853
at the beginning,
not in the middle.

407
00:17:20,922 --> 00:17:22,087
So...

408
00:17:22,156 --> 00:17:24,924
will you go out
on a date with me?

409
00:17:24,992 --> 00:17:27,293
I don't know.

410
00:17:32,533 --> 00:17:34,600
Okay.

411
00:17:34,669 --> 00:17:36,335
But I warn you,

412
00:17:36,404 --> 00:17:38,537
I just got out of
a weird relationship,

413
00:17:38,606 --> 00:17:41,207
and I might complain
about my ex a lot.

414
00:17:41,275 --> 00:17:45,144
Maybe he's being weird because he
doesn't know how to ask for his ring back.

415
00:17:53,621 --> 00:17:55,254
Hey.

416
00:17:55,322 --> 00:17:57,056
Hi.

417
00:17:57,124 --> 00:17:58,691
Where you been?

418
00:17:58,759 --> 00:18:00,626
Just out.

419
00:18:00,695 --> 00:18:02,227
All right, look, um...

420
00:18:02,296 --> 00:18:04,463
I'm sorry that we fought before.

421
00:18:04,532 --> 00:18:06,932
I know this is
a really unusual situation,

422
00:18:07,001 --> 00:18:09,935
and if you don't want me
to do it, I won't.

423
00:18:10,004 --> 00:18:11,737
Really?

424
00:18:11,806 --> 00:18:13,172
Yeah.

425
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:15,708
We're a team.
We're in this together.

426
00:18:17,411 --> 00:18:19,344
I'll be right back.

427
00:18:33,928 --> 00:18:35,494
What is that?

428
00:18:35,563 --> 00:18:37,763
It's a sample cup.

429
00:18:37,832 --> 00:18:42,134
Really? 'Cause it looks like
the top off the NyQuil bottle.

430
00:18:43,370 --> 00:18:45,370
It's the closest thing
I could find.

431
00:18:45,473 --> 00:18:48,040
- It's a gesture. Shut up.
- All right, sorry.

432
00:18:49,577 --> 00:18:52,444
So... are you saying
you're okay with this?

433
00:18:52,513 --> 00:18:54,046
I don't know,

434
00:18:54,115 --> 00:18:56,548
but... when I told you
I didn't want to have kids,

435
00:18:56,617 --> 00:18:59,151
you didn't have a say
in that, so...

436
00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:01,954
maybe I don't need
to have a say in this.

437
00:19:03,023 --> 00:19:04,456
Thank you.

438
00:19:04,525 --> 00:19:07,292
They couldn't have picked
a better person.

439
00:19:11,132 --> 00:19:13,065
Are you calling Zack?

440
00:19:13,134 --> 00:19:15,801
No, Sheldon. Would you say
that last part one more time?

441
00:19:17,334 --> 00:19:18,334
Oh, my...
