1
00:00:02,127 --> 00:00:03,238
Leonard, when are you leaving

2
00:00:03,262 --> 00:00:04,822
to pick your mother up
from the airport?

3
00:00:04,863 --> 00:00:07,464
Uh, well, let's see, her
plane gets in at 3:00,

4
00:00:07,532 --> 00:00:10,933
figure half hour to get
her luggage, so... never.

5
00:00:11,637 --> 00:00:13,270
Never?

6
00:00:13,338 --> 00:00:16,740
Isn't that usually
when you go to the gym?

7
00:00:16,808 --> 00:00:19,242
Are you really not gonna
pick up your mother?

8
00:00:19,311 --> 00:00:21,389
No-- it's fine, she likes
to take a cab or a shuttle.

9
00:00:21,413 --> 00:00:23,313
That way she can meet people.

10
00:00:23,382 --> 00:00:24,481
Well, that's kind of nice.

11
00:00:24,549 --> 00:00:26,316
Yeah, she always says
that a stranger is just

12
00:00:26,385 --> 00:00:30,120
a person whose emotional weak
point you haven't found yet.

13
00:00:31,189 --> 00:00:33,556
Your mom is the best.

14
00:00:33,625 --> 00:00:35,158
Oh, maybe I should pick her up.

15
00:00:35,227 --> 00:00:36,493
You don't drive.

16
00:00:36,561 --> 00:00:38,172
That's what makes you
and me a great team.

17
00:00:38,196 --> 00:00:39,229
Go get your keys.

18
00:00:40,699 --> 00:00:41,731
You can't pick her up.

19
00:00:41,833 --> 00:00:43,144
It'll make me
look like a bad son.

20
00:00:43,168 --> 00:00:44,501
I imagine that's
one of the things

21
00:00:44,569 --> 00:00:45,702
we'll talk about
on the ride.

22
00:00:46,772 --> 00:00:48,738
That and Amy's
recent reluctance

23
00:00:48,807 --> 00:00:49,973
to use turn signals.

24
00:00:50,042 --> 00:00:53,276
We were in a parking garage.

25
00:00:53,345 --> 00:00:54,778
Come on,
she gave birth to you.

26
00:00:54,846 --> 00:00:56,146
Fine, I'll pick her up.

27
00:00:56,214 --> 00:00:57,280
Good, I'll go with you.

28
00:00:57,349 --> 00:00:58,726
- I call back seat.
- Oh, I don't want to be

29
00:00:58,750 --> 00:01:00,417
the only one who doesn't go.

30
00:01:00,485 --> 00:01:02,697
I'll just sit here afraid that
you're all talking about me.

31
00:01:02,721 --> 00:01:03,921
We're not gonna
talk about you.

32
00:01:03,989 --> 00:01:06,289
Well, that's my other fear.

33
00:01:06,358 --> 00:01:09,426
This is crazy. I can
pick her up by myself.

34
00:01:12,464 --> 00:01:13,887
So it's just you?

45
00:01:43,022 --> 00:01:44,938
How was your flight?

46
00:01:45,007 --> 00:01:46,774
There were some parents
with a baby.

47
00:01:46,842 --> 00:01:48,142
A lot of crying.

48
00:01:48,210 --> 00:01:49,943
Well, babies do that.

49
00:01:50,012 --> 00:01:51,478
No, it was the parents.

50
00:01:53,315 --> 00:01:56,216
It seems they couldn't handle
some constructive criticism.

51
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:00,988
Hey, on a completely
unrelated note, um,

52
00:02:01,057 --> 00:02:02,890
you know, if you'd
rather stay at a hotel,

53
00:02:02,958 --> 00:02:04,425
we wouldn't be offended.

54
00:02:04,493 --> 00:02:07,628
Actually, I've been looking
forward to staying with you.

55
00:02:07,696 --> 00:02:11,098
Really? It's just, normally,
you stay at a hotel.

56
00:02:11,872 --> 00:02:13,561
Would you like me
to stay at a hotel?

57
00:02:13,585 --> 00:02:14,302
No, no, no.

58
00:02:14,303 --> 00:02:17,071
I-I invited you to stay with us.

59
00:02:17,139 --> 00:02:18,705
And I accepted,

60
00:02:18,774 --> 00:02:20,641
so everyone is happy.

61
00:02:20,709 --> 00:02:22,643
Yep.

62
00:02:22,711 --> 00:02:25,245
I'm happy, you're happy...

63
00:02:26,382 --> 00:02:29,683
...everyone's happy.

64
00:02:31,087 --> 00:02:33,554
How come we never eat
in the dining room?

65
00:02:33,622 --> 00:02:34,622
Oh, that's for company.

66
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:39,893
What am I?

67
00:02:39,962 --> 00:02:42,362
Apparently, a guy who wants
to have his feelings hurt.

68
00:02:43,999 --> 00:02:45,899
When does Anu
come back from London?

69
00:02:45,968 --> 00:02:48,001
Next week.
But it's been good, you know?

70
00:02:48,070 --> 00:02:51,138
Really given me a chance
to focus on myself.

71
00:02:51,207 --> 00:02:52,506
How's that going?

72
00:02:52,575 --> 00:02:55,175
I didn't like what I saw,
got in my car, drove over here.

73
00:02:56,278 --> 00:02:57,978
- Hey, guys.
- Hey. - Hey.

74
00:02:58,047 --> 00:02:59,491
I'm sorry,
I didn't know you had company.

75
00:02:59,515 --> 00:03:02,149
It's all right,
neither did they.

76
00:03:02,218 --> 00:03:03,750
Is Stuart home?

77
00:03:03,819 --> 00:03:05,085
No, he's at work.

78
00:03:05,154 --> 00:03:07,454
The last juice.
I'm gonna add it to the list.

79
00:03:15,931 --> 00:03:17,664
That's whose handwriting
that is.

80
00:03:19,034 --> 00:03:21,235
I've noticed she's been
over here a lot lately.

81
00:03:21,303 --> 00:03:22,447
You know how you noticed that?

82
00:03:22,471 --> 00:03:25,205
Because you're over
here a lot lately.

83
00:03:25,274 --> 00:03:27,608
She has slept over
every night this week.

84
00:03:27,676 --> 00:03:29,387
Uh, no, no,
she wasn't here Wednesday night.

85
00:03:29,411 --> 00:03:31,189
Yes, she was. You didn't notice
because you were in the hot tub

86
00:03:31,213 --> 00:03:33,147
in the backyard eating Oreos.

87
00:03:33,215 --> 00:03:35,949
That reminds me.

88
00:03:38,154 --> 00:03:40,220
Oreos.

89
00:03:41,690 --> 00:03:43,323
Really?

90
00:03:43,392 --> 00:03:45,259
A photon entanglement team.

91
00:03:45,327 --> 00:03:47,327
Yeah, I-I'm actually
the colead.

92
00:03:47,396 --> 00:03:49,474
Yeah, if you like photons
and how they get entangled,

93
00:03:49,498 --> 00:03:51,632
he's your co-guy.

94
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:54,134
I would enjoy
seeing your lab.

95
00:03:55,271 --> 00:03:57,204
Oh. Yeah, sure.

96
00:03:57,273 --> 00:03:59,173
Uh, if you want,
you can come tomorrow.

97
00:03:59,241 --> 00:04:00,707
I look forward to it.

98
00:04:00,743 --> 00:04:02,409
Well, I think
I'm going to turn in.

99
00:04:02,444 --> 00:04:03,544
Good night, Penny.

100
00:04:03,612 --> 00:04:04,945
Good night, dear.

101
00:04:05,014 --> 00:04:07,314
- Good night.
- Night, Beverly.

102
00:04:07,349 --> 00:04:10,250
Wow, she's being really nice.

103
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:12,052
Yeah, clearly,
one of us is dying.

104
00:04:14,089 --> 00:04:15,155
Come on, her.

105
00:04:16,292 --> 00:04:18,525
Or you accomplished
something great,

106
00:04:18,594 --> 00:04:20,027
and she's genuinely proud.

107
00:04:20,095 --> 00:04:22,329
Yeah, all right,
you've had enough.

108
00:04:24,733 --> 00:04:27,034
Hi.

109
00:04:27,102 --> 00:04:28,569
- Hey.
- Oh, it's so good

110
00:04:28,637 --> 00:04:30,237
to see your face.

111
00:04:30,306 --> 00:04:31,872
H-How's the concierge
conference?

112
00:04:31,941 --> 00:04:33,674
You guys just get
theater tickets

113
00:04:33,742 --> 00:04:34,942
for each other all day long?

114
00:04:35,010 --> 00:04:37,844
It's going great,

115
00:04:37,913 --> 00:04:40,314
and the company put me
in a nice place in Notting Hill.

116
00:04:40,382 --> 00:04:42,816
Notting Hill? Like the movie?

117
00:04:42,885 --> 00:04:46,753
Uh, "I'm just a boy standing
in front of a girl saying..."

118
00:04:46,822 --> 00:04:49,356
you better bring me home
a T-shirt.

119
00:04:50,459 --> 00:04:51,925
I can't wait for you
to come home.

120
00:04:51,994 --> 00:04:55,929
Actually, that's one
of the reasons I called.

121
00:04:55,998 --> 00:04:58,565
They offered me
a management position.

122
00:04:58,634 --> 00:05:01,134
That's amazing.
T-That's your dream.

123
00:05:01,203 --> 00:05:03,237
It's here in London.

124
00:05:03,305 --> 00:05:05,405
Oh.

125
00:05:05,474 --> 00:05:08,875
And they want me
to start right away.

126
00:05:08,944 --> 00:05:11,345
What does that mean for us?

127
00:05:11,413 --> 00:05:15,048
Well, how committed are you
to staying in California?

128
00:05:15,117 --> 00:05:18,785
This is where my work is,
this is where my friends are.

129
00:05:18,854 --> 00:05:20,254
But are you happy?

130
00:05:20,322 --> 00:05:22,589
Not for years.
What's your point?

131
00:05:25,227 --> 00:05:28,795
All right, I got to head
out to my drawing class.

132
00:05:28,864 --> 00:05:30,364
Fruit or naked dudes?

133
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:33,620
Actually, it doesn't matter,
I'm jealous of both.

134
00:05:34,737 --> 00:05:36,870
- I'll see you tonight?
- Yeah.

135
00:05:39,808 --> 00:05:41,408
So she's coming over again, huh?

136
00:05:41,477 --> 00:05:43,910
Yeah, we're gonna
do a movie night.

137
00:05:43,979 --> 00:05:47,648
It's my house. Don't you think
you should ask me?

138
00:05:47,716 --> 00:05:49,750
You're right, I'm sorry.

139
00:05:49,818 --> 00:05:53,253
Howard, would you like
to come to movie night?

140
00:05:54,523 --> 00:05:56,290
Doesn't she have her own place?

141
00:05:56,358 --> 00:05:57,858
Why don't you guys
hang out there?

142
00:05:57,926 --> 00:05:59,293
Oh, she has
a roommate,

143
00:05:59,361 --> 00:06:01,895
and he's kind of creepy.

144
00:06:01,964 --> 00:06:05,399
A-And that's coming from me.

145
00:06:05,467 --> 00:06:09,036
It just feels like Denise
is basically living with us.

146
00:06:09,104 --> 00:06:11,938
You know, maybe you can spend
half the time at her place.

147
00:06:12,007 --> 00:06:14,441
Hey, when I moved in, you
and Bernadette said it was okay

148
00:06:14,510 --> 00:06:16,109
if I brought girls over.

149
00:06:16,178 --> 00:06:19,112
Oh. We were making fun of you.

150
00:06:23,085 --> 00:06:26,453
And this is a high-pulse laser
with a BBO crystal.

151
00:06:26,522 --> 00:06:27,954
It's pretty cool.

152
00:06:28,023 --> 00:06:30,724
It emits photons
in discrete bursts.

153
00:06:30,793 --> 00:06:33,560
Huh. Very impressive.

154
00:06:33,629 --> 00:06:36,396
But...?

155
00:06:37,499 --> 00:06:38,865
But what, dear?

156
00:06:38,934 --> 00:06:40,367
Oh, I don't know.

157
00:06:40,436 --> 00:06:42,669
It's just,
usually there's a "but"

158
00:06:42,738 --> 00:06:46,773
followed by something
that makes me feel bad.

159
00:06:46,842 --> 00:06:48,241
Ah, Beverly, there you are.

160
00:06:48,310 --> 00:06:50,510
Sheldon, how nice to see you.

161
00:06:50,579 --> 00:06:52,746
Leonard was just
showing me his new lab.

162
00:06:52,815 --> 00:06:54,915
Oh, yes, experimental physics,

163
00:06:54,983 --> 00:06:57,517
the carpentry
of the science world. Well...

164
00:06:59,054 --> 00:07:01,455
I'm here to rescue you
from the boredom.

165
00:07:01,523 --> 00:07:04,157
Not necessary. This is
really quite interesting.

166
00:07:04,226 --> 00:07:06,827
But...?

167
00:07:06,895 --> 00:07:08,862
But nothing.

168
00:07:08,931 --> 00:07:12,199
Oh. Well, if you want to see
something really interesting,

169
00:07:12,267 --> 00:07:13,533
I could show you my work,

170
00:07:13,602 --> 00:07:15,836
which is being talked about
for a Nobel Prize.

171
00:07:15,904 --> 00:07:17,437
Oh, well,
I'd love to see it later,

172
00:07:17,506 --> 00:07:19,573
but right now,
I'm spending time with my son.

173
00:07:19,608 --> 00:07:22,275
Ha! I knew there was
a "but"-- wait, what?

174
00:07:24,713 --> 00:07:26,146
Ready?

175
00:07:26,215 --> 00:07:28,915
You sure I didn't need
to see <i>Paddington 1?</i>

176
00:07:28,984 --> 00:07:30,617
He's a bear, he talks,
no one knows why.

177
00:07:30,686 --> 00:07:31,918
You're all caught up.

178
00:07:31,987 --> 00:07:34,054
Push play.

179
00:07:34,123 --> 00:07:36,356
May I join you?

180
00:07:38,794 --> 00:07:42,195
Oh. Hey, Mitch,
I didn't see you there.

181
00:07:42,264 --> 00:07:46,299
Really? I've been standing here
the whole time.

182
00:07:47,403 --> 00:07:49,703
Well, sure. Yeah, join us.

183
00:08:00,582 --> 00:08:01,848
Movie's up there.

184
00:08:01,917 --> 00:08:03,216
I've seen it.

185
00:08:05,587 --> 00:08:07,521
It's wonderful.

186
00:08:12,661 --> 00:08:14,394
So she's staying in London?

187
00:08:14,463 --> 00:08:16,129
What does that mean
for your relationship?

188
00:08:16,198 --> 00:08:17,497
It's great.

189
00:08:17,566 --> 00:08:20,300
I can see why she would
say that, but why do you?

190
00:08:20,369 --> 00:08:22,636
Well, we got into this
because we both wanted

191
00:08:22,704 --> 00:08:25,238
to get married, and honestly,
we've been dragging our feet,

192
00:08:25,307 --> 00:08:28,074
and I think this
is the push that we need.

193
00:08:28,143 --> 00:08:30,777
Wait, so you're gonna
ask her to marry you?

194
00:08:30,846 --> 00:08:32,245
Why not?

195
00:08:32,314 --> 00:08:33,814
We like each
other, plus,

196
00:08:33,882 --> 00:08:35,415
we both want to start a family.

197
00:08:35,484 --> 00:08:36,961
Hey, I can work from anywhere,
I'm an astronomer.

198
00:08:36,985 --> 00:08:38,151
They have stars in London,

199
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:41,154
and I'm not just talking
about Dame Judi Dench.

200
00:08:41,223 --> 00:08:42,989
No one thought you were.

201
00:08:43,058 --> 00:08:44,424
I thought he was.

202
00:08:45,961 --> 00:08:48,895
So you're really gonna move
halfway across the world?

203
00:08:49,998 --> 00:08:52,098
If she says yes,

204
00:08:52,167 --> 00:08:56,169
and if that's what
she wants to do, then yeah.

205
00:08:56,238 --> 00:08:57,637
Wow.

206
00:08:57,706 --> 00:08:59,639
Yeah, I know.
I'm flying out tomorrow.

207
00:08:59,708 --> 00:09:01,408
I'm gonna surprise her
with a ring.

208
00:09:01,477 --> 00:09:02,198
You already have a ring?

209
00:09:02,222 --> 00:09:03,967
Well, it's the
same one as before.

210
00:09:05,144 --> 00:09:07,681
I thought you gave it to her
the first time you got engaged?

211
00:09:07,749 --> 00:09:08,815
I did, but I took it back.

212
00:09:10,953 --> 00:09:14,788
So, you're an Indian giver?

213
00:09:17,893 --> 00:09:18,751
Howie.

214
00:09:18,775 --> 00:09:19,894
What? If he's gonna
move to England,

215
00:09:19,895 --> 00:09:21,795
I need to get all
these out now.

216
00:09:24,566 --> 00:09:26,833
Here you go.
Light cream, no sugar.

217
00:09:26,902 --> 00:09:28,301
That's perfect, thank you.

218
00:09:28,370 --> 00:09:29,970
Beverly, I have to
say, it's so nice

219
00:09:30,038 --> 00:09:32,005
seeing the two of you get along.

220
00:09:32,074 --> 00:09:33,773
Oh, I've always
gotten along with Leonard.

221
00:09:33,842 --> 00:09:38,311
Of all of my children,
he's the most docile.

222
00:09:38,380 --> 00:09:40,480
She wrote that
in a birthday card once.

223
00:09:40,549 --> 00:09:42,883
I keep it in my nightstand.

224
00:09:42,951 --> 00:09:44,885
Still, it made him so happy

225
00:09:44,953 --> 00:09:47,387
showing you around
his lab yesterday.

226
00:09:47,456 --> 00:09:49,389
Interesting.

227
00:09:49,458 --> 00:09:51,691
Would you say that
that made him, uh,

228
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:53,326
much happier than usual,

229
00:09:53,395 --> 00:09:57,731
somewhat happier than usual
or as happy as usual?

230
00:09:57,799 --> 00:09:59,566
Hmm, multiple choice.

231
00:09:59,635 --> 00:10:03,837
Um, I'm-a go with D:
"that's a weird question."

232
00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:07,240
It made me
really happy.

233
00:10:07,309 --> 00:10:10,977
We haven't always had
the easiest relationship.

234
00:10:11,046 --> 00:10:12,879
But, well,
looking back,

235
00:10:12,948 --> 00:10:15,148
I guess you were
just trying to push me

236
00:10:15,217 --> 00:10:16,816
to be the best version
of myself.

237
00:10:16,885 --> 00:10:18,985
So you would say that
my parenting strategies,

238
00:10:19,054 --> 00:10:20,720
although difficult at times,

239
00:10:20,789 --> 00:10:23,723
directly contributed
to your current success?

240
00:10:23,792 --> 00:10:25,912
Well, I may have had a little
something to do with it.

241
00:10:25,961 --> 00:10:28,281
I mean, how often do you wear
your superhero underwear now?

242
00:10:30,165 --> 00:10:32,210
- Only Fridays and my birthday.
- Yeah, that was all me.

243
00:10:32,234 --> 00:10:33,533
That was me.

244
00:10:33,569 --> 00:10:35,001
Yeah, that's a fair point.

245
00:10:35,037 --> 00:10:37,203
I hadn't considered
your influence.

246
00:10:37,272 --> 00:10:40,173
Perhaps tomorrow I could observe
the two of you together?

247
00:10:40,242 --> 00:10:41,942
Uh, "observe"?

248
00:10:42,010 --> 00:10:43,810
What is going on?

249
00:10:43,879 --> 00:10:46,079
I'm just visiting with my son

250
00:10:46,148 --> 00:10:48,481
and doing research
for my book on how various

251
00:10:48,550 --> 00:10:52,252
parenting strategies affected
my children as adults.

252
00:10:53,388 --> 00:10:54,921
This has all
been work to you?

253
00:10:57,759 --> 00:11:01,227
Hanging out with me
and coming to my lab, I...

254
00:11:01,296 --> 00:11:03,563
I thought we were enjoying
each other's company,

255
00:11:03,632 --> 00:11:05,031
but it was just research.

256
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:07,367
I was enjoying it;
you know I love research.

257
00:11:09,471 --> 00:11:11,571
I can't believe this.

258
00:11:13,375 --> 00:11:16,242
- What? You seem angry.
- Of course I'm angry!

259
00:11:16,311 --> 00:11:19,479
Well, so would you say
that you're somewhat angry,

260
00:11:19,548 --> 00:11:21,548
very angry or extremely angry?

261
00:11:21,617 --> 00:11:23,083
Never mind.

262
00:11:23,151 --> 00:11:25,285
I can see it in your face, dear.

263
00:11:30,754 --> 00:11:33,054
I'm looking over my
text correspondence

264
00:11:33,123 --> 00:11:34,956
with Beverly and I
don't see anything

265
00:11:35,025 --> 00:11:36,491
that would have
given her offense.

266
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:38,059
Nothing's ambiguous,

267
00:11:38,128 --> 00:11:39,728
I spell everything out.

268
00:11:39,796 --> 00:11:43,198
Including "laugh out loud"
and "what's the fracas?"

269
00:11:43,266 --> 00:11:45,767
I'm sure she's not mad at you.

270
00:11:45,836 --> 00:11:48,303
Well, then why would she rather
spend the day with Leonard?

271
00:11:50,407 --> 00:11:52,440
Because he's her son?

272
00:11:52,509 --> 00:11:55,877
Amy, I just feel like
we're going in circles.

273
00:11:55,946 --> 00:11:57,378
You-- What?

274
00:11:57,447 --> 00:11:59,514
No knock? What's the fracas?

275
00:12:01,218 --> 00:12:02,917
I am so stupid.

276
00:12:02,986 --> 00:12:05,920
I-I actually thought my mom
was genuinely proud of me.

277
00:12:05,989 --> 00:12:08,890
It turns out, she's just using
me as research for her new book.

278
00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:10,391
Oh, what a relief.

279
00:12:10,460 --> 00:12:12,527
I thought Beverly was mad at me.
Thank you, Leonard.

280
00:12:15,031 --> 00:12:17,499
That is a weight
off my shoulders.

281
00:12:17,567 --> 00:12:20,001
If you like her so much you can
have her, 'cause I-I'm done.

282
00:12:20,070 --> 00:12:21,770
Oh, great.
Catch the two of you later.

283
00:12:21,838 --> 00:12:23,805
Sheldon, no.

284
00:12:23,874 --> 00:12:24,540
Why?

285
00:12:24,564 --> 00:12:26,876
Well, it's an
emotionally complex issue.

286
00:12:26,877 --> 00:12:28,676
I don't have time
to explain it right now.

287
00:12:28,745 --> 00:12:31,146
Okay, but that excuse
is running out of steam.

288
00:12:33,583 --> 00:12:36,785
Well, Raj is probably
on his way to the airport.

289
00:12:36,853 --> 00:12:38,222
Yeah.

290
00:12:38,246 --> 00:12:39,488
Guess he's finally getting

291
00:12:39,489 --> 00:12:41,823
his big romantic
movie moment.

292
00:12:41,892 --> 00:12:43,792
With a woman who
doesn't care about

293
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:45,126
big romantic
movie moments.

294
00:12:45,195 --> 00:12:47,362
Well, he'll have
the rest of his life

295
00:12:47,430 --> 00:12:49,297
to explain them to her.

296
00:12:49,366 --> 00:12:51,966
You can't really think
this is a good idea.

297
00:12:52,035 --> 00:12:54,602
Of course I don't.
What am I supposed to do?

298
00:12:54,671 --> 00:12:57,138
Go stop him. Get your
best friend back.

299
00:12:58,575 --> 00:13:00,353
- You're my best friend.
- We don't have time for this!

300
00:13:00,377 --> 00:13:01,609
Go!

301
00:13:04,047 --> 00:13:06,981
You know, Leonard
was really upset.

302
00:13:07,050 --> 00:13:08,650
Shouldn't you go talk to him?

303
00:13:08,718 --> 00:13:10,919
And send the message
that he can get what he wants

304
00:13:10,987 --> 00:13:14,455
by throwing a tantrum?
I don't think so.

305
00:13:14,524 --> 00:13:18,259
Beverly, put down your phone
and go apologize to your son.

306
00:13:22,199 --> 00:13:24,833
Oh, so now you're not
talking to me?

307
00:13:24,901 --> 00:13:27,468
When you're finished with
your tantrum, I'd be glad to.

308
00:13:28,972 --> 00:13:30,905
Just let me know
when you're done.

309
00:13:30,974 --> 00:13:33,274
Oh, my God.

310
00:13:33,343 --> 00:13:36,444
When am I gonna stop
trying to win her approval?

311
00:13:36,513 --> 00:13:37,745
E-Every time
I'm around her,

312
00:13:37,814 --> 00:13:41,583
I-I turn into this needy
little eight-year-old boy.

313
00:13:41,651 --> 00:13:45,019
You sound like that now
and she's not even here.

314
00:13:46,323 --> 00:13:47,922
If I could respond

315
00:13:47,991 --> 00:13:50,525
more compassionately
than Sheldon...

316
00:13:50,594 --> 00:13:54,095
and thank you
for making it so easy.

317
00:13:55,999 --> 00:13:57,966
The need for a
mother's approval

318
00:13:58,034 --> 00:14:00,201
is baked into
our biology.

319
00:14:00,270 --> 00:14:02,403
I know that, it's just...

320
00:14:02,472 --> 00:14:05,273
after all these years, you'd
think I would have learned.

321
00:14:05,342 --> 00:14:08,076
Hmm. It's too bad you didn't.

322
00:14:09,179 --> 00:14:10,511
Well, see?

323
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:12,413
Compassion.

324
00:14:17,254 --> 00:14:18,274
You okay?

325
00:14:18,298 --> 00:14:20,122
Oh, yeah.
My neck's a little stiff.

326
00:14:20,123 --> 00:14:22,056
Maybe because my boyfriend
made me sleep

327
00:14:22,125 --> 00:14:24,559
in a comic book store
last night.

328
00:14:24,628 --> 00:14:27,629
Bet your neck would hurt
if you slept in any store.

329
00:14:28,999 --> 00:14:32,267
Except maybe a mattress store.

330
00:14:32,335 --> 00:14:35,103
I-I'm sorry, but I couldn't
sleep at your place.

331
00:14:35,171 --> 00:14:36,871
Mitch was really
freaking me out.

332
00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:38,273
He was freaking me out, too,

333
00:14:38,341 --> 00:14:39,974
but there has to be
a better solution.

334
00:14:40,043 --> 00:14:41,445
Tonight we'll go
back to my place.

335
00:14:41,469 --> 00:14:43,060
And tomorrow?

336
00:14:43,847 --> 00:14:45,513
With my health being what it is,

337
00:14:45,582 --> 00:14:48,583
I try to live one day at a time.

338
00:14:48,652 --> 00:14:51,152
I don't want to blame you,
but if you'd moved in with me

339
00:14:51,221 --> 00:14:53,354
when I asked you to, we wouldn't
be in this situation.

340
00:14:55,392 --> 00:14:56,925
You're right.

341
00:14:56,993 --> 00:14:58,526
It's my fault.

342
00:15:00,597 --> 00:15:02,897
When I had the chance,
I was scared and...

343
00:15:02,966 --> 00:15:06,100
now that I want to,
you're stuck with Mitch.

344
00:15:06,169 --> 00:15:08,736
So you do want to
move in with me?

345
00:15:08,805 --> 00:15:13,975
More than Galactus
wants to devour worlds.

346
00:15:14,044 --> 00:15:16,644
Well, that's great 'cause
I want to move in with you

347
00:15:16,713 --> 00:15:20,014
more than the Thing
wants to clobber.

348
00:15:20,083 --> 00:15:23,418
More than Hulk
wants to smash?

349
00:15:23,486 --> 00:15:25,586
More than Batman
wants to ignore

350
00:15:25,655 --> 00:15:28,122
the due process of law.

351
00:15:29,693 --> 00:15:31,192
We are so weird.

352
00:15:34,597 --> 00:15:37,031
Raj! Stop!

353
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:39,200
What?

354
00:15:39,269 --> 00:15:41,536
What are you doing here?

355
00:15:41,604 --> 00:15:43,304
Look...

356
00:15:43,373 --> 00:15:44,872
if you're getting
on that plane

357
00:15:44,941 --> 00:15:47,675
because you love
Anu and you...

358
00:15:47,744 --> 00:15:49,644
can't stand the thought
of spending another day

359
00:15:49,713 --> 00:15:52,313
without her...
then go.

360
00:15:53,416 --> 00:15:55,016
If not...

361
00:15:55,085 --> 00:15:56,951
then stay here with...

362
00:15:57,020 --> 00:15:58,886
the people
who love you.

363
00:15:58,955 --> 00:16:02,857
But what if this is my last
chance at marriage and family?

364
00:16:02,926 --> 00:16:04,092
I promise you it's not.

365
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:06,060
Believe me,
somewhere out there

366
00:16:06,129 --> 00:16:09,297
is a woman who
loves cooking shows

367
00:16:09,366 --> 00:16:11,899
and sweater
vests and...

368
00:16:11,968 --> 00:16:15,003
all the other dumb
things you love.

369
00:16:15,071 --> 00:16:16,804
You really think so?

370
00:16:16,873 --> 00:16:18,539
Yes.

371
00:16:18,608 --> 00:16:20,208
And I don't
think she's...

372
00:16:20,276 --> 00:16:22,010
waiting for you
in England.

373
00:16:23,546 --> 00:16:26,147
When you propose to
someone in Notting Hill...

374
00:16:26,216 --> 00:16:29,350
it should be to someone who
knows what that movie is.

375
00:16:31,087 --> 00:16:32,754
Are you saying...

376
00:16:32,822 --> 00:16:35,823
you're just a boy...

377
00:16:35,892 --> 00:16:39,427
standing in front
of another boy...

378
00:16:39,496 --> 00:16:41,763
saying you don't
want him to leave?

379
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,200
Sure.

380
00:16:49,873 --> 00:16:51,406
I love you, buddy.

381
00:16:51,474 --> 00:16:53,408
I love you, too.

382
00:16:56,479 --> 00:16:57,912
No.

383
00:16:57,981 --> 00:17:00,448
No, no, that's not
what's happening here.

384
00:17:00,517 --> 00:17:02,450
Come on.

385
00:17:02,519 --> 00:17:03,951
How'd you get
past security?

386
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:06,521
I had to buy a ticket.
You owe me 1,300 bucks.

387
00:17:10,093 --> 00:17:11,392
Penny, can I have a moment alone

388
00:17:11,461 --> 00:17:12,827
with my...?
- Yep, bye.

389
00:17:16,366 --> 00:17:17,865
Have you calmed down?

390
00:17:17,934 --> 00:17:19,901
No, I'm not calm.
You really hurt me.

391
00:17:19,969 --> 00:17:22,303
- That wasn't my intention.
- It doesn't matter

392
00:17:22,372 --> 00:17:24,238
what you intended.

393
00:17:24,307 --> 00:17:26,307
What matters is the way
you made me feel.

394
00:17:26,376 --> 00:17:29,177
Actually, the way y-you've
always made me feel.

395
00:17:31,481 --> 00:17:32,980
I see, so...

396
00:17:33,049 --> 00:17:34,393
you're here to tell me
all the ways

397
00:17:34,417 --> 00:17:37,518
that I failed you as a mother.
- Yeah.

398
00:17:37,587 --> 00:17:41,189
And get comfortable,
'cause i-it's a long list.

399
00:17:45,328 --> 00:17:48,362
Is it happening soon?

400
00:17:52,068 --> 00:17:53,348
You know what?
It doesn't matter.

401
00:17:55,939 --> 00:17:57,972
Doesn't matter,
you're never gonna change.

402
00:17:59,976 --> 00:18:02,410
If I want you
to accept me for me,

403
00:18:02,479 --> 00:18:05,513
then I guess I'm gonna
have to accept you for you.

404
00:18:05,582 --> 00:18:06,848
So...

405
00:18:09,018 --> 00:18:10,351
I forgive you.

406
00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:13,154
- I didn't ask you to forgive me.
- Too bad.

407
00:18:13,223 --> 00:18:16,124
I forgive you anyway.

408
00:18:16,192 --> 00:18:19,494
And I forgive myself for
taking so long to do it.

409
00:18:20,597 --> 00:18:22,563
Oh, my God, that feels so good.

410
00:18:25,735 --> 00:18:29,370
I must admit, it...

411
00:18:29,439 --> 00:18:30,905
it does feel good.

412
00:18:33,343 --> 00:18:34,742
What does?

413
00:18:36,713 --> 00:18:38,646
You forgiving me.

414
00:18:41,951 --> 00:18:44,318
It means a lot.

415
00:18:45,421 --> 00:18:47,121
Thank you.

416
00:19:23,229 --> 00:19:26,655
Look, I was...
scared to move in,

417
00:19:26,656 --> 00:19:29,423
but that was a mistake
because she is amazing

418
00:19:29,492 --> 00:19:32,093
and I really want
to live with her.

419
00:19:32,161 --> 00:19:33,394
So...

420
00:19:33,463 --> 00:19:35,997
think you'd be willing
to find another place?

421
00:19:36,065 --> 00:19:37,398
Do you love her?

422
00:19:37,467 --> 00:19:38,677
Oh, we haven't
really said that yet.

423
00:19:38,701 --> 00:19:40,401
Yeah, I do.

424
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:42,503
Don't say it to me,
say it to her.

425
00:19:46,209 --> 00:19:47,908
I love you.

426
00:19:47,977 --> 00:19:49,977
I love you, too.

427
00:19:52,081 --> 00:19:54,815
Now both of you say it to me.

428
