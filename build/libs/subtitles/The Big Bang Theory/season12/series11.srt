1
00:00:01,660 --> 00:00:03,393
Champagne, a champagne,

2
00:00:03,462 --> 00:00:07,363
a champagne
with a packet of Splenda in it.

3
00:00:07,432 --> 00:00:10,366
- You know what I call this drink?
- A waste of champagne?

4
00:00:10,435 --> 00:00:12,869
No. A Dr. Cooper.

5
00:00:14,039 --> 00:00:15,238
Because...

6
00:00:15,307 --> 00:00:17,874
He's <i>also</i> sweet and bubbly.

7
00:00:19,177 --> 00:00:20,643
All right.

8
00:00:20,712 --> 00:00:23,246
A... a toast
to Sheldon and Amy

9
00:00:23,315 --> 00:00:25,482
and the publication
of your super-asymmetry paper.

10
00:00:25,550 --> 00:00:27,517
We are so proud of you guys.

11
00:00:27,586 --> 00:00:30,153
- Cheers. - Thanks.
- Yay. Boom.

12
00:00:31,556 --> 00:00:34,257
Ooh! That is PhD-licious.

13
00:00:35,794 --> 00:00:37,894
So, have you guys gotten
any feedback yet?

14
00:00:37,963 --> 00:00:39,496
Well, there are
some comments online,

15
00:00:39,564 --> 00:00:41,798
but we haven't read them.
We decided we don't care

16
00:00:41,867 --> 00:00:43,654
what people say
about our work.

17
00:00:43,678 --> 00:00:44,268
Good for you.

18
00:00:44,269 --> 00:00:46,102
People online
can be so mean.

19
00:00:46,171 --> 00:00:48,071
I posted a picture of myself
on Instagram,

20
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:51,141
and some jerk said I looked
so skinny I might disappear.

21
00:00:52,177 --> 00:00:54,344
And yet,
somehow she soldiers on.

22
00:00:54,412 --> 00:00:55,945
Mm.

23
00:00:56,014 --> 00:00:58,715
Although, Amy and I did
give the world a gift.

24
00:00:58,783 --> 00:01:01,751
It would be nice to read
some of the thank-you notes.

25
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:04,721
I'm surprised you're interested
in some stranger's opinion.

26
00:01:04,789 --> 00:01:07,290
Well, as I always say,
a stranger's just a friend

27
00:01:07,359 --> 00:01:08,925
who hasn't complimented me yet.

28
00:01:10,028 --> 00:01:11,261
Okay.

29
00:01:11,329 --> 00:01:12,829
- I'll read them.
- If any of them

30
00:01:12,898 --> 00:01:16,499
accuse you of being too pretty,
Penny can help you through it.

31
00:01:17,936 --> 00:01:22,505
Okay, here's one
from Dr. Saltzberg at UCLA.

32
00:01:22,574 --> 00:01:24,719
Wait, no, stop. I don't want to know.
What if he's mean?

33
00:01:24,743 --> 00:01:26,576
Well, what if
he's complimentary?

34
00:01:26,645 --> 00:01:28,545
I want to know.

35
00:01:28,613 --> 00:01:30,180
Okay. He says...

36
00:01:30,248 --> 00:01:32,048
- I don't want to know.
- All right, just...

37
00:01:32,117 --> 00:01:33,716
let me see it.

38
00:01:35,086 --> 00:01:37,253
Okay, this is...
this is really positive.

39
00:01:37,322 --> 00:01:38,855
Wow, it's,

40
00:01:38,924 --> 00:01:39,989
like, <i>really</i> positive.

41
00:01:40,058 --> 00:01:43,660
He says it might be
the discovery of the decade.

42
00:01:44,763 --> 00:01:46,529
He's right.
They love it!

43
00:01:46,598 --> 00:01:47,864
This is so exciting.

44
00:01:47,933 --> 00:01:49,933
Oh, this may be the
Dr. Cooper talking,

45
00:01:50,001 --> 00:01:51,363
but pour me
another Dr. Cooper.

00:02:18,314 --> 00:02:20,247
Hey, Penny and I
were thinking of getting

57
00:02:20,316 --> 00:02:21,649
a big paintball game together.

58
00:02:21,717 --> 00:02:23,517
Oh, Leonard,
why does she want

59
00:02:23,586 --> 00:02:25,719
to shoot you?

60
00:02:25,788 --> 00:02:27,121
She doesn't want to shoot me.

61
00:02:27,189 --> 00:02:28,634
- Who doesn't want to shoot you?
- Penny.

62
00:02:28,658 --> 00:02:30,190
No, that doesn't sound right.

63
00:02:31,894 --> 00:02:33,427
She just wants
to play paintball.

64
00:02:33,496 --> 00:02:35,129
It combines my love of whimsy

65
00:02:35,197 --> 00:02:37,831
with her love
of making grown men cry.

66
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:40,167
Sounds fun.
Bernadette and I are in.

67
00:02:40,236 --> 00:02:43,103
- You don't need to ask her?
- No. I've been pretty annoying lately.

68
00:02:43,172 --> 00:02:45,239
She's gonna want
to shoot me.

69
00:02:45,308 --> 00:02:46,573
Dr. Cooper.

70
00:02:46,642 --> 00:02:47,908
Ah, President Siebert.

71
00:02:47,977 --> 00:02:50,010
What are you doing
in the regular cafeteria?

72
00:02:50,079 --> 00:02:51,312
You're a superstar.

73
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:53,113
No offense, worker bees.

74
00:02:53,182 --> 00:02:55,227
You should join me
in my private dining room.

75
00:02:55,251 --> 00:02:57,318
Dr. Fowler is already there.

76
00:02:57,386 --> 00:02:58,819
Can I bring my friends?

77
00:02:58,888 --> 00:03:01,322
No.

78
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:03,157
- Can I bring my tater tots?
- Yes.

79
00:03:03,225 --> 00:03:05,459
All right, let's go.

80
00:03:06,862 --> 00:03:09,029
Welcome to
the inner sanctum.

81
00:03:09,098 --> 00:03:11,699
Oh, I do love
a good sanctum.

82
00:03:13,135 --> 00:03:15,436
Sheldon, look at my fruit plate.
It's got kiwi on it.

83
00:03:15,504 --> 00:03:16,904
Ugh. I don't like kiwi.

84
00:03:16,972 --> 00:03:20,274
Neither do I, but it's so fancy.

85
00:03:20,343 --> 00:03:21,542
Well, this is nice.

86
00:03:21,610 --> 00:03:23,811
Why have we waited
so long to do this?

87
00:03:23,879 --> 00:03:26,513
Because you
never invited us.

88
00:03:26,582 --> 00:03:28,982
Ha-ha-ha!

89
00:03:29,051 --> 00:03:31,985
Well, the important thing
is you're here now,

90
00:03:32,054 --> 00:03:33,787
and we're so excited
about your work.

91
00:03:33,856 --> 00:03:36,290
This paper's going to do
big things for all of us,

92
00:03:36,359 --> 00:03:37,869
so if there's anything
that you need...

93
00:03:37,893 --> 00:03:40,413
You know, actually, I could use
some barbecue sauce for my tots.

94
00:03:40,463 --> 00:03:42,062
Oh, wait. No. Ketchup.

95
00:03:42,131 --> 00:03:45,165
Can we have some barbecue
sauce and ketchup over here?

96
00:03:45,234 --> 00:03:47,167
Both?

97
00:03:48,337 --> 00:03:50,237
So this is how
the other half lives.

98
00:03:51,574 --> 00:03:54,375
I just want you to know
that you have our full support,

99
00:03:54,443 --> 00:03:56,377
and we're organizing
a big media push.

100
00:03:56,445 --> 00:03:57,945
Articles.
Interviews.

101
00:03:58,013 --> 00:04:00,080
Oh, you want us
to do interviews?

102
00:04:00,149 --> 00:04:02,850
Well, we're thinking
a divide-and-conquer approach here,

103
00:04:02,918 --> 00:04:04,451
where you do the interviews,

104
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:07,654
and Sheldon stays here
and holds down the fort.

105
00:04:07,723 --> 00:04:09,289
You know...

106
00:04:09,358 --> 00:04:10,518
in case there's an emergency.

107
00:04:10,559 --> 00:04:13,494
What kind of an emergency
would there be in physics?

108
00:04:13,562 --> 00:04:15,729
I don't know, maybe there's
an object in motion

109
00:04:15,798 --> 00:04:17,331
that won't stay in motion.

110
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:18,699
Or a reaction

111
00:04:18,768 --> 00:04:20,868
that's equal but not opposite.

112
00:04:20,936 --> 00:04:23,036
It sounds like

113
00:04:23,105 --> 00:04:25,939
you don't want Sheldon
to do the interviews.

114
00:04:26,008 --> 00:04:28,186
It's not that we don't want
<i>Sheldon</i> to do the interviews,

115
00:04:28,210 --> 00:04:30,370
it's just that we really
want <i>you</i> to do the interviews.

116
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:33,380
Without Sheldon.

117
00:04:33,449 --> 00:04:35,048
Now, wait, wait,

118
00:04:35,117 --> 00:04:36,683
are you trying
to exclude me?

119
00:04:36,752 --> 00:04:38,352
Look, Sheldon,
you're a brilliant man,

120
00:04:38,421 --> 00:04:39,920
but your people skills are...

121
00:04:39,989 --> 00:04:41,422
This is not barbecue sauce!

122
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:43,690
This is steak sauce!
What are you trying to pull?

123
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:45,159
Like that.

124
00:04:45,227 --> 00:04:46,493
This is ridiculous.

125
00:04:46,562 --> 00:04:48,962
It is my work, too,
and I am perfectly capable

126
00:04:49,031 --> 00:04:51,131
of keeping it together
for an interview.

127
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:54,201
Okay. Say somebody asks
if you feel your work

128
00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:58,038
is derivative of the work
of Professor Joseph Polchinski.

129
00:05:06,982 --> 00:05:10,350
Seriously, can we get
this man some barbecue sauce!?

130
00:05:13,456 --> 00:05:15,422
Would you mind stocking these?

131
00:05:15,491 --> 00:05:17,124
Actually, I'm not
on the clock today.

132
00:05:17,193 --> 00:05:19,026
I'm just hanging out
with my boyfriend.

133
00:05:19,094 --> 00:05:20,794
Ah, cool. Huh.

134
00:05:20,863 --> 00:05:22,563
That's me, right?

135
00:05:22,631 --> 00:05:24,131
Oh, I forgot to tell you--

136
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:26,366
I broke up with you,
and now I'm

137
00:05:26,435 --> 00:05:29,269
dating... that guy.

138
00:05:29,338 --> 00:05:30,704
I know you're joking,

139
00:05:30,773 --> 00:05:33,740
but my flight-or-flight
response doesn't.

140
00:05:33,809 --> 00:05:35,943
Isn't it fight-or-flight?

141
00:05:36,011 --> 00:05:38,479
Not for me.

142
00:05:38,547 --> 00:05:41,014
So I told my mom
she just needed to back off.

143
00:05:41,083 --> 00:05:42,349
This is our wedding,

144
00:05:42,418 --> 00:05:44,062
and if anyone's gonna design
the floral arrangements,

145
00:05:44,086 --> 00:05:47,120
it's going to be my man.

146
00:05:47,189 --> 00:05:48,589
Thank you.

147
00:05:48,657 --> 00:05:51,225
I mean, I-I'm not trying
to be a groomzilla,

148
00:05:51,293 --> 00:05:54,027
but... this is my specialty.

149
00:05:57,266 --> 00:05:58,599
Someone texting you?

150
00:05:58,667 --> 00:06:00,133
Uh, no. It's just my,

151
00:06:00,202 --> 00:06:02,135
uh, doorbell camera.

152
00:06:02,204 --> 00:06:04,938
Oh. I got one of those for my
place, but I never installed it.

153
00:06:05,007 --> 00:06:06,673
Oh, it's easy.
I can do it for you.

154
00:06:06,742 --> 00:06:08,475
You're gonna love it.
It's how I found out

155
00:06:08,544 --> 00:06:11,945
a raccoon was stealing my
cheese-of-the-month club.

156
00:06:12,014 --> 00:06:13,247
What did you do?

157
00:06:13,315 --> 00:06:15,048
Nothing. I didn't
want to piss it off.

158
00:06:15,117 --> 00:06:17,017
It was, like, huge from
eating all the cheese.

159
00:06:18,988 --> 00:06:21,088
Hey. We're doing a big
paintball game on Saturday

160
00:06:21,156 --> 00:06:22,589
if you two want to join.

161
00:06:22,658 --> 00:06:24,836
Oh, my roommate asked me to
help her move out on Saturday.

162
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:26,159
Ugh. That sucks.

163
00:06:26,228 --> 00:06:28,028
Sucks for her.
I'm playing paintball.

164
00:06:29,598 --> 00:06:31,798
I-I didn't know
your roommate was moving out.

165
00:06:31,867 --> 00:06:33,967
Yeah. I've been looking
for a new one,

166
00:06:34,036 --> 00:06:36,336
but... so far no luck.

167
00:06:36,405 --> 00:06:37,704
You hear that?

168
00:06:37,773 --> 00:06:40,340
She needs a roommate.

169
00:06:47,883 --> 00:06:49,816
What do you think, Stuart?

170
00:06:49,885 --> 00:06:52,019
Uh, i-i-it, uh...

171
00:06:52,087 --> 00:06:53,987
Flight.

172
00:06:54,056 --> 00:06:55,322
Flight.

173
00:07:00,129 --> 00:07:02,796
- That was hard to watch.
- Yeah.

174
00:07:06,635 --> 00:07:10,504
Okay, I need you to
be honest with me.

175
00:07:10,573 --> 00:07:12,506
How do I look?

176
00:07:15,344 --> 00:07:18,612
A little shorter, but as we age
that happens to all of us.

177
00:07:18,681 --> 00:07:20,480
Come on, help me out here.

178
00:07:20,549 --> 00:07:22,849
I've got a bunch
of interviews today.

179
00:07:22,918 --> 00:07:26,286
Well, no one'll notice.
They never met you before.

180
00:07:26,355 --> 00:07:28,088
Sheldon, I'm nervous,

181
00:07:28,157 --> 00:07:29,990
and I wish you were
coming with me.

182
00:07:30,059 --> 00:07:32,960
If it helps, I wrote up
some possible questions

183
00:07:33,028 --> 00:07:34,461
and answers for you.

184
00:07:35,564 --> 00:07:37,497
"Whom do you love more,

185
00:07:37,566 --> 00:07:41,034
"Sheldon the scientist
or Sheldon the man?

186
00:07:42,671 --> 00:07:44,371
"Answer: Sheldon
the scientist,

187
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:48,108
but by such a slim margin
that it's statistically insignificant."

188
00:07:49,478 --> 00:07:52,879
Well, you really managed
to capture my voice.

189
00:07:52,948 --> 00:07:55,015
Well, don't worry.
I'm sure you're gonna do great.

190
00:07:55,084 --> 00:07:56,483
Thank you.

191
00:07:56,552 --> 00:07:58,318
- Okay, bye.
- Wait-wait-wait.

192
00:07:58,387 --> 00:08:00,854
- You forgot the cards.
- Love you, too.

193
00:08:03,892 --> 00:08:06,193
Really? She asked you
to move in with her?

194
00:08:06,261 --> 00:08:07,461
Yeah, she was

195
00:08:07,529 --> 00:08:08,662
hinting around about it,

196
00:08:08,731 --> 00:08:11,064
but I think I handled it
pretty well.

197
00:08:12,134 --> 00:08:13,400
"Pretty well"?

198
00:08:13,469 --> 00:08:16,536
You ran out of there so fast,
if it was a cartoon,

199
00:08:16,605 --> 00:08:19,473
there would have been a
Stuart-shaped hole in the wall.

200
00:08:20,776 --> 00:08:21,776
Was she mad?

201
00:08:21,810 --> 00:08:23,443
Uh, no. I talked to her after.

202
00:08:23,512 --> 00:08:24,811
She said she's fine.

203
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:27,247
- Oh, no. - Yikes!
- You'll find someone new.

204
00:08:29,752 --> 00:08:31,018
Everything okay?

205
00:08:31,086 --> 00:08:32,753
Yeah, it's just
Anu's doorbell camera.

206
00:08:32,821 --> 00:08:34,287
I helped her install it.

207
00:08:34,356 --> 00:08:36,089
You can't look at it.
That's spying.

208
00:08:36,158 --> 00:08:37,457
Who the hell is this guy?

209
00:08:37,526 --> 00:08:38,526
Ooh, let me see.

210
00:08:40,996 --> 00:08:42,396
He's got... bags.

211
00:08:42,464 --> 00:08:44,064
He's probably
just delivering food.

212
00:08:45,934 --> 00:08:47,467
Why is she hugging him?

213
00:08:47,536 --> 00:08:49,503
Maybe she doesn't
have tip money?

214
00:08:51,206 --> 00:08:53,740
W-Wait, why is she
inviting him into the house?

215
00:08:53,809 --> 00:08:56,176
She's a good tipper?

216
00:08:58,647 --> 00:09:01,782
Do you ever feel guilty
that we get to eat

217
00:09:01,850 --> 00:09:04,851
in the fancy dining room while our
friends have to eat in the regular one?

218
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:08,789
Yes. Wait, did you say
"guilty" or "happy"?

219
00:09:08,857 --> 00:09:10,290
"Guilty."

220
00:09:10,359 --> 00:09:12,259
Oh, then no.

221
00:09:12,327 --> 00:09:16,229
In fact, take a picture of me
with the garlic knots to send them.

222
00:09:16,298 --> 00:09:18,098
There's my MVP--

223
00:09:18,167 --> 00:09:19,966
Most Valuable Physicist.

224
00:09:20,035 --> 00:09:21,401
Thank you.

225
00:09:21,470 --> 00:09:23,503
And my star
of NPR <i>Science Friday</i>

226
00:09:23,572 --> 00:09:26,606
and a potpourri
of popular podcasts.

227
00:09:26,675 --> 00:09:30,310
I don't know if I'd
use the word "star."

228
00:09:30,379 --> 00:09:33,613
I would. I got an early look at
the interview you did for <i>Wired,</i>

229
00:09:33,682 --> 00:09:35,816
and it is glowing.
They loved you.

230
00:09:35,884 --> 00:09:37,551
That's great.
Thanks for telling me.

231
00:09:37,619 --> 00:09:38,685
Congratulations, Amy.

232
00:09:38,754 --> 00:09:40,687
- I'm so proud of you.
- And that headline--

233
00:09:40,756 --> 00:09:43,657
"The Neurobiologist
Who Revolutionized Physics."

234
00:09:43,726 --> 00:09:46,927
I'm sorry.
The who who did what to-- huh?

235
00:09:52,963 --> 00:09:55,264
Oh, hey,
how did your interview go?

236
00:09:55,332 --> 00:09:57,132
Okay, I guess.

237
00:09:57,201 --> 00:09:58,600
You don't sound
very happy.

238
00:09:58,669 --> 00:09:59,968
Oh, why wouldn't
she be happy?

239
00:10:00,037 --> 00:10:02,504
She's the neurobiologist
who revolutionized physics.

240
00:10:02,573 --> 00:10:05,507
Sorry.

241
00:10:05,576 --> 00:10:09,011
This should be fun.
I've never played before.

242
00:10:09,079 --> 00:10:11,179
Oh, fair warning-- it can
get pretty ugly out there.

243
00:10:11,248 --> 00:10:13,582
Okay, well, remember,
I'm your fianc?e.

244
00:10:13,651 --> 00:10:16,118
Oh, I remember. Do you?

245
00:10:17,221 --> 00:10:19,087
All right, we need two teams.

246
00:10:19,156 --> 00:10:20,522
Who wants to be the captain?

247
00:10:20,591 --> 00:10:21,790
Oh, me.

248
00:10:21,859 --> 00:10:23,592
Uh, sure.
Why not?

249
00:10:23,661 --> 00:10:25,327
All right, why don't
you pick first?

250
00:10:25,396 --> 00:10:27,996
Okay, um... Leonard.

251
00:10:28,065 --> 00:10:30,632
Yeah?

252
00:10:30,701 --> 00:10:32,100
No, I'm picking you.

253
00:10:32,169 --> 00:10:34,536
First? For a team?

254
00:10:34,605 --> 00:10:37,873
What is happening?

255
00:10:37,942 --> 00:10:40,809
All right,
I take Bernadette.

256
00:10:40,878 --> 00:10:43,211
Really?
You're picking her over me?

257
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:46,281
Yeah, 'cause she's vicious
and can hide behind a mushroom.

258
00:10:47,418 --> 00:10:49,351
Um... Sheldon.

259
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:51,920
Raj.

260
00:10:51,989 --> 00:10:53,922
Amy.

261
00:10:53,991 --> 00:10:55,090
I'll take Anu.

262
00:11:00,097 --> 00:11:01,097
Howard.

263
00:11:02,433 --> 00:11:04,066
All rightie.

264
00:11:04,134 --> 00:11:07,636
Come on, pick me, pick me.

265
00:11:07,705 --> 00:11:09,972
I will take... Stuart!

266
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:11,440
Yes!

267
00:11:14,378 --> 00:11:15,677
Okay, guys, we
need some people

268
00:11:15,746 --> 00:11:17,312
to stay here and
guard the flag

269
00:11:17,381 --> 00:11:19,192
and some people to move out
and try to capture theirs.

270
00:11:19,216 --> 00:11:20,860
Okay. Sheldon,
do you want to stay here and...?

271
00:11:20,884 --> 00:11:22,429
What? Hold down the fort?
'Cause that's all I'm good for.

272
00:11:22,453 --> 00:11:23,563
Is that what you
were going to say?

273
00:11:23,587 --> 00:11:25,187
You know
that's not what he meant.

274
00:11:25,255 --> 00:11:26,455
Oh, why don't
you go out there?

275
00:11:26,490 --> 00:11:27,667
Maybe you'll be
the neurobiologist

276
00:11:27,691 --> 00:11:28,890
who revolutionizes
paintball.

277
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:31,360
Stop it.
You're being ridiculous.

278
00:11:31,428 --> 00:11:33,929
Am I? Maybe it's just
my poor people skills.

279
00:11:33,998 --> 00:11:37,399
Oh, it's definitely
your poor people skills.

280
00:11:37,468 --> 00:11:39,434
All right, the choices are--
get shot at

281
00:11:39,503 --> 00:11:40,914
or stay here
and listen to them fight.

282
00:11:40,938 --> 00:11:43,772
Shot at.

283
00:11:49,013 --> 00:11:51,780
This is pretty exciting,
sneaking around like this.

284
00:11:51,849 --> 00:11:55,517
Oh, so you like sneaking around.
Good to know.

285
00:11:55,586 --> 00:11:57,519
What's that
supposed to mean?

286
00:11:57,554 --> 00:11:59,321
Nothing. Never mind.

287
00:11:59,390 --> 00:12:01,556
Let me see
if the coast is clear.

288
00:12:04,877 --> 00:12:05,424
See anybody?

289
00:12:05,448 --> 00:12:08,158
Yes, I saw a strange man going
into your house the other night!

290
00:12:09,133 --> 00:12:10,899
What?

291
00:12:10,968 --> 00:12:13,068
But out there,
there's nobody.

292
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:25,280
Ow!

293
00:12:25,349 --> 00:12:27,149
I'm hit.

294
00:12:27,217 --> 00:12:29,217
Ow!

295
00:12:29,286 --> 00:12:31,319
I said I was hit!

296
00:12:31,388 --> 00:12:32,454
Sorry.

297
00:12:33,624 --> 00:12:36,124
Ow!

298
00:12:36,193 --> 00:12:37,993
Why do you keep shooting me?

299
00:12:38,062 --> 00:12:40,062
Why don't you want
to move in with me?

300
00:12:40,130 --> 00:12:42,931
I-I didn't say I didn't want to.

301
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,333
No, you just ran away.

302
00:12:45,402 --> 00:12:47,035
Stuart?

303
00:12:48,472 --> 00:12:50,238
Stuart?!

304
00:12:50,307 --> 00:12:52,174
Did you run away again?

305
00:12:52,242 --> 00:12:54,209
STUART
No!

306
00:12:55,245 --> 00:12:57,479
Bang, you're out.

307
00:12:57,548 --> 00:12:59,815
What?! I'm not out.

308
00:12:59,883 --> 00:13:01,016
You didn't even shoot me.

309
00:13:01,085 --> 00:13:02,529
I'm not gonna shoot you
from right here.

310
00:13:02,553 --> 00:13:03,697
It's too close.
It's gonna hurt.

311
00:13:03,721 --> 00:13:05,954
Oh, come on. It's not
gonna hurt that bad.

312
00:13:06,023 --> 00:13:08,523
I'm telling you, from
this distance it's gonna... Ow!

313
00:13:08,592 --> 00:13:10,926
See? That hurt!

314
00:13:10,994 --> 00:13:13,528
All right. Fine,
you can shoot me.

315
00:13:13,597 --> 00:13:15,430
- No, I'm not gonna shoot you.
- Ow!

316
00:13:17,234 --> 00:13:18,834
Ow! Ow!

317
00:13:18,902 --> 00:13:21,837
Aah, you were right.
We're way too close.

318
00:13:21,905 --> 00:13:23,638
See, I told you
it's gonna hurt...

319
00:13:23,707 --> 00:13:25,640
Ow!

320
00:13:25,709 --> 00:13:27,709
I can't believe
you're taking this out on me.

321
00:13:27,778 --> 00:13:30,345
I was just trying to get
publicity for <i>our</i> paper.

322
00:13:30,414 --> 00:13:32,314
By making it seem
like it was your idea?

323
00:13:32,382 --> 00:13:34,683
I didn't write the headline,
Sheldon.

324
00:13:34,752 --> 00:13:36,251
Did you even read the article?

325
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:38,453
Because I talk
about you continuously.

326
00:13:38,522 --> 00:13:41,656
I know, and it just made you
sound modest and charming.

327
00:13:44,061 --> 00:13:47,329
Why can't you just
be proud of me?

328
00:13:47,397 --> 00:13:49,564
I am proud of you.

329
00:13:49,633 --> 00:13:52,200
Really?
Because you sound jealous.

330
00:13:52,269 --> 00:13:54,302
Well, I'm that, too.
I've seen <i>Inside Out.</i>

331
00:13:54,371 --> 00:13:56,638
I know I can feel
two things at once.

332
00:13:58,442 --> 00:14:01,176
- Ow!
- Ow!

333
00:14:01,245 --> 00:14:04,179
Well, now I feel
three things.

334
00:14:07,217 --> 00:14:09,151
Hey.

335
00:14:09,219 --> 00:14:10,152
Who shot you?

336
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:12,420
Oh. Uh, oh...

337
00:14:12,489 --> 00:14:15,423
Denise, uh, Denise, Denise,
Denise, Denise,

338
00:14:15,492 --> 00:14:16,825
Denise, Denise, Denise,

339
00:14:16,894 --> 00:14:19,127
Denise, Denise,
Denise, Denise

340
00:14:19,196 --> 00:14:22,164
and me when I was running
from Denise.

341
00:14:22,232 --> 00:14:25,000
What is up with you two?

342
00:14:25,068 --> 00:14:27,235
Well, it's kind of
hard to explain. Uh,

343
00:14:27,304 --> 00:14:30,405
you know when things
are going great, but you worry

344
00:14:30,474 --> 00:14:32,507
that any minute
you might screw everything up?

345
00:14:32,576 --> 00:14:35,343
- No.
- Yes.

346
00:14:35,412 --> 00:14:38,547
If you really like her, you
can't let fear get in the way.

347
00:14:38,615 --> 00:14:40,215
You have to move forward.

348
00:14:40,284 --> 00:14:44,286
And at a certain point, the fear
of losing her goes away?

349
00:14:44,354 --> 00:14:45,987
I will let you know.

350
00:14:48,458 --> 00:14:50,592
- You were spying on me?
- That is not the point.

351
00:14:50,661 --> 00:14:52,694
The point is who was that man?

352
00:14:52,763 --> 00:14:54,796
Fine. That was
my ex-boyfriend.

353
00:14:54,865 --> 00:14:56,898
Some of his stuff
was still at my house,

354
00:14:56,967 --> 00:14:58,767
and he stopped by
to pick it up.

355
00:14:58,836 --> 00:15:02,537
And did you give it to him?
Did you give him his stuff?

356
00:15:02,606 --> 00:15:07,409
If "stuff" means
sex, then no.

357
00:15:07,477 --> 00:15:10,912
If "stuff" means his
Waterpik, then yes!

358
00:15:10,981 --> 00:15:12,080
I got the flag!

359
00:15:12,149 --> 00:15:14,649
I'm gonna make a run for it.
Cover me!

360
00:15:16,386 --> 00:15:19,721
So you're still talking
to your ex-boyfriend?

361
00:15:19,790 --> 00:15:21,923
Yes, and I'm not gonna
apologize for that.

362
00:15:21,992 --> 00:15:23,925
And you need to delete
that app from your phone.

363
00:15:23,994 --> 00:15:25,560
Because you're hiding
something from me?

364
00:15:25,629 --> 00:15:27,095
No, because you
should trust me!

365
00:15:27,164 --> 00:15:30,198
How can I trust you?!
I barely even know you!

366
00:15:32,736 --> 00:15:34,603
Then what are we doing?

367
00:15:34,671 --> 00:15:36,504
Why are we planning
a wedding?

368
00:15:36,573 --> 00:15:38,740
I don't know.

369
00:15:41,044 --> 00:15:42,477
Aah,

370
00:15:42,546 --> 00:15:44,312
sad man!

371
00:15:48,352 --> 00:15:49,517
Ow!

372
00:15:49,586 --> 00:15:52,487
Ha, ha! Oh. It's you.

373
00:15:52,556 --> 00:15:54,122
I can't believe you shot me!

374
00:15:54,191 --> 00:15:55,335
I can't believe I did, either.

375
00:15:55,359 --> 00:15:57,192
Right in the chest.

376
00:15:57,261 --> 00:15:59,494
Sorry. That's gonna
leave a bruise.

377
00:15:59,563 --> 00:16:01,796
Yeah, a big one.

378
00:16:01,865 --> 00:16:04,165
- Does it hurt?
- A little.

379
00:16:04,234 --> 00:16:07,535
Want to kiss it
and make it better?

380
00:16:07,604 --> 00:16:09,471
I do.

381
00:16:13,076 --> 00:16:14,409
Where are you going?

382
00:16:14,478 --> 00:16:15,944
Home.

383
00:16:16,013 --> 00:16:19,347
Don't worry. I'll wave to
the doorbell when I get there.

384
00:16:19,416 --> 00:16:20,916
Wait, wait, wait.

385
00:16:20,984 --> 00:16:22,384
At least let me drive you.

386
00:16:22,452 --> 00:16:23,985
That's okay. I'll Uber.

387
00:16:24,054 --> 00:16:25,620
We can take you.

388
00:16:25,689 --> 00:16:27,722
- Come on, Sheldon.
- Okay.

389
00:16:27,791 --> 00:16:30,158
But I should warn you,
we're in a bit of a spat.

390
00:16:30,227 --> 00:16:32,105
At least I think we are.
Amy, are we still in a spat?

391
00:16:32,129 --> 00:16:33,361
Are you ready to apologize?

392
00:16:33,430 --> 00:16:35,196
We are.

393
00:16:39,770 --> 00:16:41,002
- Aha!
- Hey!

394
00:16:41,071 --> 00:16:43,204
- Get out!
- Sorry. Sorry.

395
00:16:43,273 --> 00:16:44,639
I didn't see anything.

396
00:16:44,708 --> 00:16:45,941
Actually, could I...?

397
00:16:46,009 --> 00:16:47,175
Ooh, thank you!

398
00:16:53,265 --> 00:16:56,601
Hey.

399
00:16:56,602 --> 00:16:58,678
Wow. That's a lot of bruises.

400
00:16:58,679 --> 00:17:03,048
Yeah, well,
you shot me a lot of times.

401
00:17:04,818 --> 00:17:08,587
That's not even counting
the bruises on the inside.

402
00:17:08,655 --> 00:17:09,955
'Cause I hurt your feelings?

403
00:17:10,023 --> 00:17:13,725
Let's hope that's all it is.

404
00:17:13,794 --> 00:17:17,229
Ah, look, I'm sorry
that I freaked out.

405
00:17:17,297 --> 00:17:20,532
It's just that things are
going so good with us,

406
00:17:20,601 --> 00:17:24,369
and I'm afraid that if we go
too fast, I am gonna mess it up.

407
00:17:24,438 --> 00:17:27,772
I get that. I don't want
to mess things up, either.

408
00:17:29,710 --> 00:17:32,544
Um, I got you something.

409
00:17:32,613 --> 00:17:37,449
It's a key to my place
to show you that I'm serious.

410
00:17:37,518 --> 00:17:38,950
- Thank you.
- Mm.

411
00:17:39,019 --> 00:17:40,819
Well, isn't this technically

412
00:17:40,888 --> 00:17:44,289
a key to Howard
and Bernadette's place?

413
00:17:44,358 --> 00:17:47,792
Yes, so don't ever use it or
let them know that you have it.

414
00:17:47,861 --> 00:17:49,961
- Come here.
- Oh. Uh, no.

415
00:17:50,030 --> 00:17:54,599
I appreciate it, but
seriously, this is all bruise.

416
00:17:54,668 --> 00:17:56,401
Kiss?

417
00:17:56,470 --> 00:17:58,403
Gently.

418
00:18:00,674 --> 00:18:02,908
Ow.

419
00:18:04,311 --> 00:18:06,611
I'm about to start recording.
Are you guys ready?

420
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:08,647
Sheldon, are you ready?

421
00:18:08,715 --> 00:18:10,582
- Absolutely.
- Great.

422
00:18:10,651 --> 00:18:13,952
So, Dr. Cooper,
my first question is for you.

423
00:18:14,021 --> 00:18:16,354
Oh, goody.

424
00:18:16,423 --> 00:18:18,757
Would you say that your paper
is an extension

425
00:18:18,825 --> 00:18:21,293
of the work
of Professor Joseph Polchinski?

426
00:18:39,237 --> 00:18:40,870
I'll be in the car.
