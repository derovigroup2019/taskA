The Big Bang Theory...

2
00:00:01,939 --> 00:00:05,309
Uh, we sort of have another
reason for asking you here.

3
00:00:06,347 --> 00:00:08,046
We want to have a baby,

4
00:00:08,115 --> 00:00:10,015
but we can't do it
on our own.

5
00:00:10,084 --> 00:00:11,016
Okay, whoa, whoa.

6
00:00:11,085 --> 00:00:12,217
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

7
00:00:12,319 --> 00:00:14,052
Yeah, this has been
such a nice evening.

8
00:00:14,121 --> 00:00:16,955
Let's all just stop before
anyone says any more things.

9
00:00:17,024 --> 00:00:18,468
Leonard, would you be
the father of our baby?

10
00:00:18,492 --> 00:00:20,559
Oh, you said a thing.

11
00:00:22,596 --> 00:00:25,397
Thank you, guys, again
for agreeing to do this.

12
00:00:25,466 --> 00:00:27,666
Yeah, it means
so much to us.

13
00:00:27,735 --> 00:00:29,368
Ah, we're happy
we can help.

14
00:00:29,436 --> 00:00:32,037
Yeah, and we don't find it
weird at all.

15
00:00:32,106 --> 00:00:33,705
It's a little weird
for us, too.

16
00:00:33,774 --> 00:00:35,874
I mean, instead of our baby
looking like Zack,

17
00:00:35,943 --> 00:00:38,243
it's gonna look
like Leonard.

18
00:00:39,246 --> 00:00:41,446
Or Penny if it's a girl.

19
00:00:43,517 --> 00:00:45,083
No, no, it's not gonna look...

20
00:00:46,086 --> 00:00:48,153
Sure.

21
00:00:49,256 --> 00:00:50,489
But I promise,

22
00:00:50,558 --> 00:00:52,135
we're gonna be
really good parents.

23
00:00:52,159 --> 00:00:53,193
Mm-hmm.

24
00:00:53,194 --> 00:00:54,593
Oh, we know you will.

25
00:00:54,662 --> 00:00:56,261
- So, what is the next step?
- Yeah.

26
00:00:56,330 --> 00:00:58,664
Well, Leonard, we were hoping
you'd go in on Monday.

27
00:00:58,732 --> 00:00:59,732
Okay.

28
00:00:59,767 --> 00:01:01,133
And they say,
for the best results,

29
00:01:01,202 --> 00:01:02,846
between now and then,
you shouldn't have sex.

30
00:01:02,870 --> 00:01:04,102
Sorry, bro,

31
00:01:04,171 --> 00:01:06,672
I know it seems impossible
to go for five days without,

32
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:09,107
but I believe in you.

33
00:01:09,176 --> 00:01:12,277
Five days?
My record is 24 years.

34
00:01:13,948 --> 00:01:16,081
Uh, I think that also means
no flying solo.

35
00:01:16,150 --> 00:01:17,082
Oh.

36
00:01:17,151 --> 00:01:20,586
Then my record is 14 years.

37
00:01:20,654 --> 00:01:22,888
And, well, we're really
hoping for a son.

38
00:01:22,957 --> 00:01:25,224
So just, like, keep that in mind
when you're in there.

39
00:01:25,292 --> 00:01:29,228
Yeah, just think, "Little
boys, little boys."

40
00:01:31,498 --> 00:01:34,399
Still just
totally not weird.

41
00:01:34,468 --> 00:01:36,068
Hello.

42
00:01:36,136 --> 00:01:38,114
Oh, hey, Sheldon. We're kind of
in the middle of something.

43
00:01:38,138 --> 00:01:40,305
Oh, I won't be a moment.
I just need to grab a book

44
00:01:40,374 --> 00:01:41,873
off a high shelf, which I can do

45
00:01:41,942 --> 00:01:44,309
because I am both
tall and smart.

46
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:47,980
Sheldon, come home!

47
00:01:48,048 --> 00:01:50,616
They don't want
to have your baby!

48
00:01:50,684 --> 00:01:52,195
I don't know
what you're talking about.

49
00:01:52,219 --> 00:01:54,353
Oh-oh, dear, I think
I got something in my eye.

50
00:01:54,421 --> 00:01:56,755
My piercing, blue eye.

51
00:01:57,958 --> 00:02:00,259
- Sheldon!
- Fine.

52
00:02:00,327 --> 00:02:03,223
I've also never had a cavity
and I don't have asthma...

00:02:29,902 --> 00:02:33,804
So, this week
would have been my wedding

64
00:02:33,872 --> 00:02:37,074
if Anu and I hadn't decided
to slow things down.

65
00:02:37,142 --> 00:02:40,010
Oh, yeah, I would have
forgotten, except for those

66
00:02:40,079 --> 00:02:42,946
nonrefundable airline tickets
to India I bought.

67
00:02:43,015 --> 00:02:44,114
I'm sorry.

68
00:02:44,183 --> 00:02:47,951
No, no. What's $3,000
between friends?

69
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:49,453
Yeah, I probably
would've just

70
00:02:49,521 --> 00:02:52,055
thrown it away on health care
for my children.

71
00:02:53,292 --> 00:02:55,592
Uh, if you still want to go,
you can go to India

72
00:02:55,661 --> 00:02:58,395
and help my dad eat
all the nonrefundable sushi.

73
00:02:58,464 --> 00:03:00,564
Indian sushi?

74
00:03:00,632 --> 00:03:03,600
I need a change of underwear
just thinking about that.

75
00:03:03,669 --> 00:03:06,837
I really think
we made the right decision.

76
00:03:06,905 --> 00:03:08,972
Agreed, although
I did have

77
00:03:09,041 --> 00:03:11,775
a pretty awesome bachelor party
planned for this weekend.

78
00:03:11,844 --> 00:03:12,776
Really? What was it?

79
00:03:12,845 --> 00:03:14,125
Well, I used my NASA connections

80
00:03:14,179 --> 00:03:16,213
to get us four seats
on that plane

81
00:03:16,281 --> 00:03:18,615
that lets you experience
weightlessness.

82
00:03:18,684 --> 00:03:21,685
The Vomit Comet.
That is so cool.

83
00:03:21,754 --> 00:03:23,954
I've always wanted
to experience weightlessness.

84
00:03:24,022 --> 00:03:25,956
The closest I ever came
was that time

85
00:03:26,024 --> 00:03:28,492
I accidentally set my scale
to kilograms.

86
00:03:30,562 --> 00:03:33,330
I know, it would've
been fun, but, hey,

87
00:03:33,398 --> 00:03:37,067
the next time you decide to
marry a woman you barely know.

88
00:03:37,136 --> 00:03:38,502
We could still go.

89
00:03:38,570 --> 00:03:40,604
You know, make it
a guys' weekend.

90
00:03:40,672 --> 00:03:42,939
Yeah.
All right, let's do it.

91
00:03:43,008 --> 00:03:45,709
Great. It'll be like
the good old days.

92
00:03:45,778 --> 00:03:49,112
You mean when we were all sad,
desperate and horribly alone?

93
00:03:50,883 --> 00:03:52,949
I remember it more fondly.

94
00:03:55,521 --> 00:03:58,355
Leonard, if you had
food on your face,

95
00:03:58,423 --> 00:03:59,567
would you want me to tell you?

96
00:03:59,591 --> 00:04:02,692
Where? Did I get it?

97
00:04:02,761 --> 00:04:05,061
Oh, no, not now;
it was last week.

98
00:04:06,365 --> 00:04:07,909
I didn't know
whether or not to tell you,

99
00:04:07,933 --> 00:04:09,766
but everyone was staring.

100
00:04:09,835 --> 00:04:12,435
For the record,
it was right there.

101
00:04:12,504 --> 00:04:15,238
And it was Nutella.

102
00:04:15,307 --> 00:04:16,239
Thanks.

103
00:04:16,308 --> 00:04:18,275
You looked like
a hazelnut Hitler.

104
00:04:19,645 --> 00:04:22,212
Hey, who wants to hear
some exciting news?

105
00:04:22,281 --> 00:04:23,413
Oh, what's up?

106
00:04:23,482 --> 00:04:26,883
This weekend, I got us
four seats on the Vomit Comet.

107
00:04:26,952 --> 00:04:29,786
Oh, you lost me at "vomit,"
you lost me again at "comet,"

108
00:04:29,855 --> 00:04:32,522
and to be honest, I was
on the fence at "us."

109
00:04:34,092 --> 00:04:35,970
Yeah, I can't go either.
Penny's dad is visiting

110
00:04:35,994 --> 00:04:38,028
from Nebraska, and I haven't
seen him for a while.

111
00:04:38,096 --> 00:04:40,130
Oh, that's nice
you guys get along.

112
00:04:40,199 --> 00:04:42,766
I forget, Howard, does your
father-in-law still hate you?

113
00:04:45,003 --> 00:04:46,403
He doesn't hate me.

114
00:04:46,471 --> 00:04:48,004
He's just disappointed

115
00:04:48,073 --> 00:04:50,574
that I'm not
any other man on the planet.

116
00:04:51,944 --> 00:04:55,378
That's how I feel about
Ben Affleck as Batman.

117
00:04:56,582 --> 00:04:57,614
Well, these two are out.

118
00:04:57,683 --> 00:04:58,949
There goes
our guys' weekend.

119
00:04:59,017 --> 00:05:01,251
Okay, so let's make it
a couples' weekend.

120
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:02,786
I'll bring Anu,
you bring Bernadette.

121
00:05:02,855 --> 00:05:04,032
I'm not sure
Bernie would like it.

122
00:05:04,056 --> 00:05:05,989
Maybe I'll invite
Stuart or Bert.

123
00:05:06,058 --> 00:05:07,457
Oh, go with Bert!

124
00:05:07,526 --> 00:05:10,126
He's huge. It'd be fun to
watch him float around.

125
00:05:11,296 --> 00:05:12,996
Like that time the
Underdog balloon

126
00:05:13,065 --> 00:05:15,532
got away at the
Macy's Parade.

127
00:05:18,237 --> 00:05:20,070
Hey. What are those?

128
00:05:20,138 --> 00:05:21,404
Oh, vitamins.

129
00:05:21,473 --> 00:05:24,574
Zack wants me to take them
to increase my virility.

130
00:05:24,643 --> 00:05:27,010
Zack used the word "virility"?

131
00:05:29,081 --> 00:05:31,848
He may have said
"wiener power."

132
00:05:34,152 --> 00:05:35,418
Okay, that's my dad.

133
00:05:35,487 --> 00:05:37,888
Now, remember, do not bring up
any baby stuff, all right?

134
00:05:37,956 --> 00:05:39,615
Not me not wanting one,
not you having one with Zack.

135
00:05:39,616 --> 00:05:40,143
Got it.

136
00:05:40,167 --> 00:05:41,826
And if he brings it up,
change the subject

137
00:05:41,827 --> 00:05:43,393
to literally anything else.
- I got it.

138
00:05:43,462 --> 00:05:46,630
But not the Cornhuskers.
Do not discuss the Cornhuskers.

139
00:05:46,698 --> 00:05:49,532
Is that a sports team?

140
00:05:49,601 --> 00:05:51,134
Never mind, you're good.

141
00:05:52,704 --> 00:05:54,638
- Daddy! Hi.
- Hey, Slugger.

142
00:05:54,706 --> 00:05:56,306
Aw.

143
00:05:56,375 --> 00:05:58,975
- Hey, Wyatt.
- Leonard.

144
00:05:59,044 --> 00:06:00,944
Hey, that's a hell
of a handshake.

145
00:06:01,013 --> 00:06:03,780
Ah, well, you know,
I've been taking vitamins.

146
00:06:03,849 --> 00:06:06,449
Dad, uh, come on in,
sit down.

147
00:06:06,518 --> 00:06:08,618
Can I get you something
to drink? Maybe a beer?

148
00:06:08,687 --> 00:06:10,420
Sure, if you're having one.
Okay.

149
00:06:10,489 --> 00:06:12,389
And why wouldn't you,
since you're not pregnant?

150
00:06:14,493 --> 00:06:16,559
Um...

151
00:06:16,628 --> 00:06:19,162
Leonard wants to have a baby
with my ex-boyfriend Zack.

152
00:06:24,836 --> 00:06:27,570
How 'bout those Cornhuskers?

153
00:06:31,209 --> 00:06:35,512
Hey, would you mind if Raj
and I went away this weekend?

154
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:39,182
Well, it is important for you
two to keep the spark alive.

155
00:06:39,251 --> 00:06:42,419
No, just the bachelor party
I had planned.

156
00:06:42,487 --> 00:06:44,087
I thought we'd do it anyway.

157
00:06:44,156 --> 00:06:45,488
Oh, so a guys' weekend?

158
00:06:45,557 --> 00:06:47,597
Kinda. I mean, Sheldon
and Leonard couldn't make it,

159
00:06:47,659 --> 00:06:49,926
so Raj invited Anu
and I asked Stuart.

160
00:06:51,697 --> 00:06:54,297
Wait, you invited Stuart
before me?

161
00:06:54,366 --> 00:06:55,966
Actually, I invited Bert
before Stuart,

162
00:06:56,034 --> 00:06:58,601
but I don't know why
I just told you that.

163
00:06:58,670 --> 00:07:00,236
Why didn't you invite me?

164
00:07:00,305 --> 00:07:02,872
Because
I know you.

165
00:07:02,941 --> 00:07:06,343
You don't want to float
weightless in an airplane.

166
00:07:06,411 --> 00:07:07,610
What are you
talking about?

167
00:07:07,679 --> 00:07:09,179
I love doing crazy
stuff like that.

168
00:07:09,247 --> 00:07:12,983
Bernie, you got sick from
the teacup ride at Disneyland.

169
00:07:13,051 --> 00:07:14,751
Lots of people do.

170
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:17,320
We were still in line.

171
00:07:17,389 --> 00:07:18,989
So you don't want me to go?

172
00:07:19,057 --> 00:07:21,791
No, I want you to go
if you're gonna have fun.

173
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:24,227
I don't want you to go
if you're gonna be miserable

174
00:07:24,296 --> 00:07:26,229
and ruin it for everyone.

175
00:07:27,132 --> 00:07:28,999
Which is a long way of saying

176
00:07:29,067 --> 00:07:30,633
I want you to go!

177
00:07:33,238 --> 00:07:35,905
I think this is
going pretty good, huh?

178
00:07:38,910 --> 00:07:41,811
Maybe for you.
You threw me under the bus.

179
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:43,747
Oh, I'm sorry. I panicked.
He was judging me.

180
00:07:43,815 --> 00:07:45,515
Well, yeah, now he's judging me.

181
00:07:45,584 --> 00:07:46,883
I know. It worked.

182
00:07:48,453 --> 00:07:51,721
You two might want to talk
louder or quieter.

183
00:07:51,790 --> 00:07:54,424
In high school, he could
hear me open a can of beer

184
00:07:54,493 --> 00:07:55,792
in my closet
under a blanket.

185
00:07:59,364 --> 00:08:02,499
So let me get this
straight, Leonard.

186
00:08:02,567 --> 00:08:04,034
She doesn't want
to have your baby,

187
00:08:04,102 --> 00:08:07,070
but her dumbbell
ex-boyfriend does.

188
00:08:07,139 --> 00:08:10,373
Well, I... no, I wouldn't
say it like that.

189
00:08:10,442 --> 00:08:11,775
How would you say it?

190
00:08:13,412 --> 00:08:15,612
Uh, same words, just less angry.

191
00:08:16,815 --> 00:08:18,982
Well, I don't know
about Los Angeles,

192
00:08:19,051 --> 00:08:22,018
but in Nebraska,
that's kind of strange.

193
00:08:22,087 --> 00:08:25,488
It's strange here, too,
and we have a bakery for dogs.

194
00:08:25,557 --> 00:08:27,424
And you're okay with this?

195
00:08:27,492 --> 00:08:28,892
- I support my husband.
- Thank you.

196
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:30,204
But, you know,
if you think differently,

197
00:08:30,228 --> 00:08:31,428
you should feel free
to say so.

198
00:08:31,496 --> 00:08:34,931
You know, just like, "Ah!"
Make a scene.

199
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,635
Okay, look, they can't
have kids of their own,

200
00:08:38,703 --> 00:08:39,969
and they like
that I'm smart,

201
00:08:40,038 --> 00:08:41,871
and they want that
for their child.

202
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:42,705
No, I get it.

203
00:08:42,774 --> 00:08:43,606
You do?

204
00:08:43,675 --> 00:08:44,707
Sure.

205
00:08:44,776 --> 00:08:47,043
Back on the farm,
we had a prize stallion.

206
00:08:47,112 --> 00:08:51,214
We didn't let that just go to
waste; we put him out to stud.

207
00:08:52,984 --> 00:08:55,819
No, no, this is... this is
a little different than that...

208
00:08:55,887 --> 00:08:58,621
No, no, hey, hey,
hey, hey, hey, hey.

209
00:08:58,690 --> 00:09:01,024
Uh, you were comparing me
to a prize stud. Go on.

210
00:09:07,083 --> 00:09:09,229
You have fun with
your new best buddy?

211
00:09:09,346 --> 00:09:11,046
Hey, it's your fault
your dad likes me.

212
00:09:11,114 --> 00:09:13,081
You dated idiots
your whole life.

213
00:09:13,150 --> 00:09:15,684
Well, he was right
about one thing.

214
00:09:15,752 --> 00:09:18,920
I am married to a stud.

215
00:09:18,989 --> 00:09:20,956
Mm. Really?

216
00:09:21,024 --> 00:09:22,691
Yeah, I felt so bad
about selling you out,

217
00:09:22,759 --> 00:09:24,993
I thought I would
maybe make it up to you.

218
00:09:28,966 --> 00:09:30,632
Wait, wait. I can't.

219
00:09:30,701 --> 00:09:32,067
I mean, I want to,

220
00:09:32,135 --> 00:09:34,015
but I'm not supposed to
for the next three days.

221
00:09:34,071 --> 00:09:36,938
Oh. That's right.
I forgot.

222
00:09:37,007 --> 00:09:39,441
All right, well, guess
I'll just read a little

223
00:09:39,509 --> 00:09:41,443
and then... I don't
know... go to sleep.

224
00:09:45,749 --> 00:09:48,750
Really? That's what
you're sleeping in?

225
00:09:48,819 --> 00:09:49,996
Oh, you want me to take it off?

226
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:51,553
No.

227
00:09:51,621 --> 00:09:52,854
All right.

228
00:09:52,923 --> 00:09:55,323
Well, then pipe down
and let me read my comic book.

229
00:09:56,460 --> 00:09:58,760
Penny, I-I know
what you're doing.

230
00:09:58,829 --> 00:09:59,627
Just please stop.

231
00:09:59,696 --> 00:10:01,830
Ooh, listen to this.

232
00:10:01,898 --> 00:10:03,098
"Bam.

233
00:10:03,166 --> 00:10:04,265
"Pow.

234
00:10:04,334 --> 00:10:06,401
Take that, Batman."

235
00:10:09,639 --> 00:10:11,306
Thanks again for
doing this, guys.

236
00:10:11,375 --> 00:10:13,441
- Of course.
- So excited.

237
00:10:13,510 --> 00:10:15,176
I'm glad you came.

238
00:10:15,245 --> 00:10:17,423
Howard made it sound like
this wasn't your kind of thing.

239
00:10:17,447 --> 00:10:19,114
He did say that, but here I am.

240
00:10:19,182 --> 00:10:21,116
So what does he know?

241
00:10:21,184 --> 00:10:23,184
I'm sorry. I just...

242
00:10:23,253 --> 00:10:25,186
didn't think you'd enjoy
plummeting to the Earth

243
00:10:25,255 --> 00:10:26,521
at 400 miles an hour.

244
00:10:26,590 --> 00:10:28,256
I love going fast,

245
00:10:28,325 --> 00:10:29,591
unlike Grandma here,

246
00:10:29,659 --> 00:10:31,259
poking along
at 70 miles an hour.

247
00:10:31,328 --> 00:10:32,627
Am I right?

248
00:10:33,930 --> 00:10:36,131
I've always wanted
to do this.

249
00:10:36,199 --> 00:10:38,033
I'm an adrenaline junkie.

250
00:10:38,101 --> 00:10:39,501
Roller coasters, snowboarding,

251
00:10:39,569 --> 00:10:42,771
dating men
who bathe with their dogs.

252
00:10:42,839 --> 00:10:45,673
It was during a drought.

253
00:10:46,777 --> 00:10:48,476
I'm a thrill-seeker, too.

254
00:10:48,578 --> 00:10:50,545
I've had to pull back
since I became a mom,

255
00:10:50,614 --> 00:10:53,081
but I'll still jump on the back
of a grocery cart

256
00:10:53,150 --> 00:10:56,117
and just roll
through the meat section.

257
00:10:57,220 --> 00:10:58,420
And I'm married
to her,

258
00:10:58,488 --> 00:11:01,056
which is quite
the ride.

259
00:12:24,975 --> 00:12:27,242
Amy?

260
00:12:28,979 --> 00:12:32,180
There's something out here.

261
00:12:32,249 --> 00:12:33,982
Just trap it
under a cup,

262
00:12:34,050 --> 00:12:36,351
and I'll be there
in a minute.

263
00:12:36,419 --> 00:12:39,954
I'll try, but
it's Leonard.

264
00:12:40,023 --> 00:12:41,489
What?

265
00:12:44,194 --> 00:12:46,161
Well, what is
he doing here?

266
00:12:46,229 --> 00:12:47,740
I told you, if we left
pizza on the counter,

267
00:12:47,764 --> 00:12:49,731
we'd attract
something.

268
00:12:50,834 --> 00:12:52,300
Oh, hey, guys.

269
00:12:52,369 --> 00:12:53,701
Sorry. I used my key.

270
00:12:53,770 --> 00:12:55,570
I just needed
a place to crash.

271
00:12:55,639 --> 00:12:57,105
Is everything okay?

272
00:12:57,174 --> 00:12:58,439
Yeah, I...

273
00:12:58,508 --> 00:13:00,375
had to get out of the apartment.

274
00:13:00,443 --> 00:13:03,511
My wife kept trying
to have sex with me.

275
00:13:04,614 --> 00:13:05,747
Been there.

276
00:13:12,155 --> 00:13:14,689
Why are you trying
to avoid having sex?

277
00:13:14,758 --> 00:13:16,347
Well, we just did it
three weeks ago.

278
00:13:16,348 --> 00:13:18,092
I was talking
to Leonard!

279
00:13:20,564 --> 00:13:22,163
Well, I-I have to go
to the clinic

280
00:13:22,232 --> 00:13:23,698
for Zack and Marissa on Monday,

281
00:13:23,767 --> 00:13:26,501
and I'm supposed
to save myself until then.

282
00:13:26,570 --> 00:13:31,206
Sounds like maybe Penny's not
totally on board with that plan.

283
00:13:31,274 --> 00:13:33,341
Well, she said she was.

284
00:13:33,410 --> 00:13:37,312
But she also said
I looked dope.

285
00:13:38,782 --> 00:13:42,383
Honestly, I don't even
think I looked fly.

286
00:13:42,452 --> 00:13:43,930
So you're willing
to go through with this,

287
00:13:43,954 --> 00:13:46,020
even though
she clearly has reservations?

288
00:13:46,089 --> 00:13:47,288
If she has a problem,

289
00:13:47,357 --> 00:13:49,490
she should say something.

290
00:13:49,559 --> 00:13:50,491
She tried to seduce you.

291
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:51,492
If that's not a cry for help,

292
00:13:51,561 --> 00:13:53,127
I don't know what is.

293
00:13:54,598 --> 00:13:57,065
Penny doesn't want
to have kids.

294
00:13:57,133 --> 00:13:58,666
I respect that.

295
00:13:58,735 --> 00:14:02,170
But this is my chance to
leave a part of me behind.

296
00:14:02,239 --> 00:14:05,707
Okay, but this isn't
gonna make you a dad.

297
00:14:05,775 --> 00:14:08,176
It's gonna be
their baby, not yours.

298
00:14:08,245 --> 00:14:09,877
Although,
someday,

299
00:14:09,946 --> 00:14:11,879
if that kid wants
to know why he's short,

300
00:14:11,948 --> 00:14:14,349
nearsighted, and asthmatic...

301
00:14:15,652 --> 00:14:17,819
...he may hunt you down.

302
00:14:20,857 --> 00:14:24,792
Are you guys ready for the most
intense experience of your life?

303
00:14:24,861 --> 00:14:26,427
- Yes.
- Definitely.

304
00:14:26,496 --> 00:14:27,740
Not to brag, but
I'm an astronaut,

305
00:14:27,764 --> 00:14:29,530
so I've been
weightless before.

306
00:14:29,599 --> 00:14:31,599
Can be pretty scary.

307
00:14:32,702 --> 00:14:34,636
Please, I'm, like, 90 pounds.

308
00:14:34,704 --> 00:14:38,640
I'm weightless every time
I hold more than three balloons.

309
00:14:38,708 --> 00:14:41,309
Okay, I just need you guys
to sign these waivers,

310
00:14:41,378 --> 00:14:42,777
and then you
can go get changed.

311
00:14:42,846 --> 00:14:44,579
There are a lot
of pages here.

312
00:14:44,648 --> 00:14:47,348
Is this a waiver or a screenplay
you've been working on?

313
00:14:48,385 --> 00:14:50,285
I'm sure it's just
boilerplate.

314
00:14:50,353 --> 00:14:52,954
Absolutely. It's to protect us
in case of injury.

315
00:14:53,023 --> 00:14:55,657
It says, "Or death."

316
00:14:57,460 --> 00:15:00,061
Which is awesome.

317
00:15:01,364 --> 00:15:03,298
- Done.
- Where are the changing rooms?

318
00:15:03,366 --> 00:15:05,700
Dressing rooms
are in the back.

319
00:15:05,769 --> 00:15:07,702
No peeking.

320
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:11,739
Here you go.

321
00:15:11,808 --> 00:15:14,008
Okay. Should we go get changed?

322
00:15:14,077 --> 00:15:16,010
Yeah. Hang on a second.

323
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:17,445
What?

324
00:15:17,514 --> 00:15:19,247
Just...
I have two babies at home.

325
00:15:19,316 --> 00:15:20,648
What am I doing?

326
00:15:20,717 --> 00:15:22,317
If you don't want to do this,

327
00:15:22,385 --> 00:15:23,785
then why'd you come?

328
00:15:23,853 --> 00:15:25,498
To prove to Howard
that he doesn't know me as well

329
00:15:25,522 --> 00:15:27,789
as he thinks he does.

330
00:15:27,857 --> 00:15:29,624
Looks like he does.

331
00:15:29,693 --> 00:15:32,960
Unless I do it
and then he doesn't.

332
00:15:33,029 --> 00:15:36,164
Why not just be honest?

333
00:15:36,232 --> 00:15:37,832
You're right.

334
00:15:37,901 --> 00:15:39,834
I should be honest.

335
00:15:39,903 --> 00:15:44,038
You owe me $3,000 for those
plane tickets to India!

336
00:15:49,512 --> 00:15:51,312
Hey.

337
00:15:52,382 --> 00:15:53,781
That was a long run.

338
00:15:53,850 --> 00:15:55,717
Yeah. Well,
I was in the zone.

339
00:15:55,785 --> 00:15:57,452
You know,
and then in a diner

340
00:15:57,520 --> 00:16:02,290
and then in a massage chair
at the mall where I fell asleep.

341
00:16:02,359 --> 00:16:04,525
Are you avoiding me?

342
00:16:04,594 --> 00:16:06,694
Well, I took a nap
next to Hot Dog on a Stick.

343
00:16:06,763 --> 00:16:08,196
What do you think?

344
00:16:09,999 --> 00:16:13,267
I think you're mad at me
and Leonard,

345
00:16:13,336 --> 00:16:16,571
but maybe... you're really mad
at yourself.

346
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:18,673
Why would I be
mad at myself?

347
00:16:18,742 --> 00:16:22,310
'Cause you regret
this "no baby" plan of yours.

348
00:16:22,379 --> 00:16:23,489
You know, it's
pretty crappy of you

349
00:16:23,513 --> 00:16:24,746
to make me feel
bad about this.

350
00:16:24,814 --> 00:16:26,681
I'm not trying
to make you feel bad.

351
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:30,051
But... do you?

352
00:16:31,121 --> 00:16:32,253
Yes.

353
00:16:32,322 --> 00:16:34,122
I feel like I'm
letting everybody down.

354
00:16:34,190 --> 00:16:35,523
Hate disappointing Leonard,

355
00:16:35,592 --> 00:16:37,725
but I really hate
disappointing you.

356
00:16:37,794 --> 00:16:40,061
Oh, Slugger, you could
never disappoint me.

357
00:16:42,432 --> 00:16:46,000
Okay, your high school years
were a little rough.

358
00:16:47,070 --> 00:16:48,870
And I'm sorry about that.

359
00:16:48,938 --> 00:16:50,298
There was you
sneaking out at night

360
00:16:50,340 --> 00:16:52,220
and your boyfriends
sneaking out in the morning.

361
00:16:52,275 --> 00:16:54,008
I said sorry.

362
00:16:54,077 --> 00:16:56,077
That time you got drunk
and stole a horse.

363
00:16:56,146 --> 00:16:57,612
Yeah.

364
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:59,080
I was there.
I remember.

365
00:16:59,149 --> 00:17:00,915
Parts of it.

366
00:17:00,984 --> 00:17:03,317
But besides all that,

367
00:17:03,386 --> 00:17:06,254
being your dad is the best thing
ever happened to me.

368
00:17:07,357 --> 00:17:09,056
What about
Randall and Lisa?

369
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:12,593
They're okay.

370
00:17:12,662 --> 00:17:14,796
I just don't want you
to miss out.

371
00:17:14,864 --> 00:17:16,798
I know.

372
00:17:16,866 --> 00:17:19,133
But if this is
really what you want...

373
00:17:19,202 --> 00:17:20,968
or don't want...

374
00:17:21,037 --> 00:17:22,570
I'm on your side.

375
00:17:22,639 --> 00:17:24,572
Thanks.

376
00:17:27,277 --> 00:17:28,109
Hey.

377
00:17:28,178 --> 00:17:29,277
Hey.

378
00:17:29,345 --> 00:17:31,479
Uh, Wyatt, we need to talk.

379
00:17:31,548 --> 00:17:33,147
Sure. What's up?

380
00:17:33,216 --> 00:17:36,250
I want you to back off.

381
00:17:36,319 --> 00:17:39,654
You know? I-If Penny and I don't
have kids, that's between us.

382
00:17:39,722 --> 00:17:41,656
So you need
to stay out of it.

383
00:17:41,724 --> 00:17:43,524
Oh, Leonard, it's okay.
We talked. We're good.

384
00:17:44,527 --> 00:17:45,927
Oh.

385
00:17:49,165 --> 00:17:52,500
Okay, you could've
stopped me sooner.

386
00:17:52,569 --> 00:17:54,168
Could've let
you go longer.

387
00:17:54,237 --> 00:17:56,137
Uh-huh.

388
00:17:56,206 --> 00:17:58,072
You did great, Leonard.
Very forceful.

389
00:17:58,141 --> 00:17:59,740
Yeah?

390
00:17:59,809 --> 00:18:03,411
I-I-I felt like my voice
was a little shaky there.

391
00:18:05,181 --> 00:18:07,248
Um...

392
00:18:07,317 --> 00:18:09,851
Hey, I decided
to not go through

393
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:12,420
with this Zack
and Marissa thing.

394
00:18:12,489 --> 00:18:13,554
Really?

395
00:18:13,623 --> 00:18:15,490
- But you were so excited about it.
- I know.

396
00:18:15,558 --> 00:18:17,158
But, um...

397
00:18:17,227 --> 00:18:19,460
I think I was just
fooling myself.

398
00:18:19,529 --> 00:18:23,598
I-I would be heartbroken
if I had a kid out there

399
00:18:23,666 --> 00:18:25,666
and I wasn't his dad.

400
00:18:25,735 --> 00:18:27,535
I know you would.

401
00:18:27,604 --> 00:18:29,337
Yeah.

402
00:18:31,407 --> 00:18:33,674
So, that thing
you wanted to do last night,

403
00:18:33,743 --> 00:18:36,611
I'm available.

404
00:18:36,679 --> 00:18:38,846
I got real good hearing there,
stud.

405
00:18:41,651 --> 00:18:44,285
All right,
everyone's suited up.

406
00:18:44,354 --> 00:18:46,020
Let's head out
to the tarmac!

407
00:18:46,089 --> 00:18:47,955
Actually, one second.

408
00:18:48,024 --> 00:18:50,825
Howie, I don't think
I should do this.

409
00:18:50,894 --> 00:18:52,159
Really?

410
00:18:52,228 --> 00:18:55,463
Well, I did
not see that coming.

411
00:18:57,100 --> 00:18:58,432
Just... We have kids,

412
00:18:58,501 --> 00:19:01,035
and it's not smart to
put us both in danger.

413
00:19:01,104 --> 00:19:02,036
That's a good point.

414
00:19:02,105 --> 00:19:03,571
When I was little,
my parents

415
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:04,572
never flew together.

416
00:19:04,641 --> 00:19:06,051
We thought it was
because they loved us,

417
00:19:06,075 --> 00:19:08,809
but it turns out
they hated each other.

418
00:19:08,878 --> 00:19:10,711
See?

419
00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:12,680
I just think
I shouldn't go.

420
00:19:12,749 --> 00:19:14,460
Actually, this is much safer
than driving a car.

421
00:19:14,484 --> 00:19:16,284
Stay out of it, flyboy!

422
00:19:17,453 --> 00:19:19,587
You're right.

423
00:19:19,656 --> 00:19:21,589
But I've done this before.

424
00:19:21,658 --> 00:19:23,791
And since you really,
really want to go,

425
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:24,959
I'll stay here.

426
00:19:26,062 --> 00:19:27,562
Oh. Great.

427
00:19:27,630 --> 00:19:30,498
Unless you don't want to because
I was right and I do know you.

428
00:19:30,567 --> 00:19:33,167
Well, if you really know me,
then you know how far I'll go

429
00:19:33,236 --> 00:19:34,502
to prove a point.
- Apparently,

430
00:19:34,571 --> 00:19:36,248
34,000 feet that way,
then straight back down,

431
00:19:36,272 --> 00:19:37,316
up and down,
over and over again

432
00:19:37,340 --> 00:19:39,974
until you throw up food
you didn't even eat.

433
00:19:41,277 --> 00:19:44,011
They are definitely
your weirdest friends.

434
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:45,513
If only that were true.

435
00:19:49,819 --> 00:19:53,220
I hate this so much!

436
00:19:53,289 --> 00:19:55,856
Why am I doing this?!

437
00:19:55,925 --> 00:19:59,293
To prove a stupid point
to your husband!

438
00:19:59,362 --> 00:20:01,228
Oh, right. Worth it.

439
00:20:07,839 --> 00:20:09,572
Hey, Zack.

440
00:20:09,641 --> 00:20:13,175
Um, look, I-I know this
is gonna be disappointing,

441
00:20:13,244 --> 00:20:16,779
but, um, I-I can't do this.

442
00:20:16,848 --> 00:20:18,281
No, no, no, no.

443
00:20:18,349 --> 00:20:21,684
I-I, I know <i>how.</i> I just can't.

444
00:20:23,454 --> 00:20:24,787
But, hey, look,

445
00:20:24,856 --> 00:20:26,088
I-if you like,

446
00:20:26,157 --> 00:20:28,624
I-I know someone
who might be interested.

447
00:20:28,693 --> 00:20:31,560
No! Absolutely not!

448
00:20:33,665 --> 00:20:35,531
I'm sorry,
my wife says I'm not allowed.
