1
00:00:01,936 --> 00:00:03,336
<i>Previously on</i>
The Big Bang Theory...

2
00:00:03,337 --> 00:00:04,599
We conclusively proved
super-asymmetry,

3
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:06,968
and yet somehow we-we still
feel like imposters.

4
00:00:06,969 --> 00:00:08,904
Yeah, there should be
a term for that.

5
00:00:08,905 --> 00:00:11,907
Oh, for crying out loud,
there is a term for that!

6
00:00:11,908 --> 00:00:13,942
It's called
"imposter syndrome,"

7
00:00:13,943 --> 00:00:16,111
and you don't have it,
because you can't have it

8
00:00:16,112 --> 00:00:18,280
if you are imposters,
and you are!

9
00:00:18,281 --> 00:00:21,216
We're the ones
who discovered super-asymmetry,

10
00:00:21,217 --> 00:00:23,585
so if anyone's gonna feel like
they have imposter syndrome,

11
00:00:23,586 --> 00:00:27,355
it's us, because we're
not imposters, they are!

12
00:00:27,356 --> 00:00:30,291
You're imposters
and you're frauds!

13
00:00:36,199 --> 00:00:37,799
Is that what I
would've sounded like?

14
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:39,734
Yeah.
Yikes.

15
00:00:42,038 --> 00:00:43,572
Sheldon, look at this.

16
00:00:43,573 --> 00:00:45,073
(stammers)
Wait a minute.

17
00:00:45,074 --> 00:00:47,342
How do I know this isn't
one of those joke phones

18
00:00:47,343 --> 00:00:49,478
that squirts water in my face?

19
00:00:49,479 --> 00:00:52,113
Because that's
not even a thing. Look.

20
00:00:55,618 --> 00:00:58,553
You got called
into human resources?

21
00:00:58,554 --> 00:01:00,522
I'm sure it's because I insulted
Pemberton and Campbell

22
00:01:00,523 --> 00:01:02,290
in a room full
of Nobel Laureates.

23
00:01:02,291 --> 00:01:04,926
You did do that.

24
00:01:04,927 --> 00:01:08,530
It was awkward. People
didn't know where to look.

25
00:01:08,531 --> 00:01:09,998
This is a twist.

26
00:01:09,999 --> 00:01:11,867
Usually you're the one
getting called into H.R.

27
00:01:11,868 --> 00:01:13,135
KOOTHRAPPALI:
Yeah, now it's Amy.

28
00:01:13,136 --> 00:01:15,402
Who knew you were married
to such a bad girl.

29
00:01:16,606 --> 00:01:18,740
I suppose the signs
were always there.

30
00:01:18,741 --> 00:01:21,610
I mean, she did recently
go to that rave at the mall.

31
00:01:21,611 --> 00:01:24,679
It was a Spencer's Gifts.

32
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:26,281
There was music
and a strobe light.

33
00:01:26,282 --> 00:01:28,682
If that isn't a rave,
then I don't know what one is.

34
00:01:29,852 --> 00:01:31,887
You don't know
what one is.

35
00:01:31,888 --> 00:01:33,588
Guys, come on,
I think I'm in trouble.

36
00:01:33,589 --> 00:01:36,057
It's no big deal. I used
to get called into H.R.

37
00:01:36,058 --> 00:01:37,826
all the time.
Ms. Davis is great.

38
00:01:37,827 --> 00:01:40,462
Pro tip: if you find
strong women sexy,

39
00:01:40,463 --> 00:01:42,264
do not say it out loud.

40
00:01:42,265 --> 00:01:45,065
(phone chimes)

41
00:01:47,003 --> 00:01:49,204
Oh! She wants to see me, too.

42
00:01:49,205 --> 00:01:50,872
All right, let's get
our story straight:

43
00:01:50,873 --> 00:01:52,340
This is all your fault.

44
00:01:52,341 --> 00:01:53,708
Relax.

45
00:01:53,709 --> 00:01:55,777
You're probably just gonna
get a slap on the wrist.

46
00:01:55,778 --> 00:01:59,447
Maybe, but do not ask for that,
on the wrist or anywhere else.

47
00:01:59,448 --> 00:02:03,051
? Our whole universe
was in a hot, dense state ?

48
00:02:03,052 --> 00:02:06,354
? Then nearly 14 billion years
ago expansion started... Wait! ?

49
00:02:06,355 --> 00:02:07,989
? The Earth began to cool ?

50
00:02:07,990 --> 00:02:10,725
? The autotrophs began to drool,
Neanderthals developed tools ?

51
00:02:10,726 --> 00:02:13,228
? We built the Wall ?
? <i>We built the pyramids</i> ?

52
00:02:13,229 --> 00:02:15,931
? Math, Science, History,
unraveling the mystery ?

53
00:02:15,932 --> 00:02:17,833
? That all started
with a big bang ?

54
00:02:17,834 --> 00:02:19,400
? <i>Bang!</i> ?

55
00:02:23,698 --> 00:02:25,366
Thank you both for coming.

56
00:02:25,367 --> 00:02:28,502
President Siebert asked that
I be a part of this conversation

57
00:02:28,503 --> 00:02:31,472
to help us calmly
discuss what went wrong

58
00:02:31,473 --> 00:02:32,973
and how we can
better move forward.

59
00:02:32,974 --> 00:02:35,075
We are not here
to point fingers,

60
00:02:35,076 --> 00:02:37,443
so, Dr. Cooper,
please stop that.

61
00:02:41,983 --> 00:02:43,984
President Siebert,
would you like to start?

62
00:02:43,985 --> 00:02:46,487
(clears throat)
This is all my fault.

63
00:02:46,488 --> 00:02:48,989
I assumed you knew
the Nobel Prize was good

64
00:02:48,990 --> 00:02:52,091
and we wanted to win it,
so that's on me.

65
00:02:54,830 --> 00:02:56,729
Oh, so...
No.

66
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:01,569
I think what President Siebert
is trying to say is that

67
00:03:01,570 --> 00:03:04,738
this is a setback and we should
adopt a different strategy.

68
00:03:04,739 --> 00:03:06,740
Like maybe you two
keep your traps shut.

69
00:03:06,741 --> 00:03:10,711
"Traps." That's a fun old word.
Where's that been?

70
00:03:10,712 --> 00:03:13,781
I-I'm sorry.
I-I just-- I-I snapped.

71
00:03:13,782 --> 00:03:16,417
Oh, you're sorry!
It's all better then!

72
00:03:16,418 --> 00:03:19,220
Listen up, you have a shot
to win a Nobel Prize,

73
00:03:19,221 --> 00:03:20,588
and you're blowing it.

74
00:03:20,589 --> 00:03:22,857
I think what President Siebert
is trying to say

75
00:03:22,858 --> 00:03:25,359
is that you have a shot
to win a Nobel Prize

76
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:27,862
and you're blowing it.

77
00:03:27,863 --> 00:03:31,298
Uh, that's exactly
what he said.

78
00:03:31,299 --> 00:03:34,500
Yes, but I said it
in my calming H.R. voice.

79
00:03:35,971 --> 00:03:38,706
The science world is
a small community. People talk.

80
00:03:38,707 --> 00:03:41,876
I'm sure by now everyone knows
about your tantrum.

81
00:03:41,877 --> 00:03:44,078
All right, well,
what can we do?
Nothing.

82
00:03:44,079 --> 00:03:46,213
Let me make this
absolutely clear for you.

83
00:03:46,214 --> 00:03:47,715
You two are done talking.

84
00:03:47,716 --> 00:03:50,718
We're canceling your speaking
engagements and your interviews.

85
00:03:50,719 --> 00:03:53,821
You're gonna lie low
and let us do damage control.

86
00:03:53,822 --> 00:03:56,891
Well, if that's what you want,
that's what we'll do.

87
00:03:56,892 --> 00:03:59,727
You two winning the Nobel Prize
is very important to us,

88
00:03:59,728 --> 00:04:01,428
and not just
to the university.

89
00:04:01,429 --> 00:04:04,298
Dr. Fowler, you would be
only the fourth woman

90
00:04:04,299 --> 00:04:06,100
to win a Nobel Prize in physics.

91
00:04:06,101 --> 00:04:07,902
I don't need
to tell you

92
00:04:07,903 --> 00:04:09,236
just how inspirational
that would be

93
00:04:09,237 --> 00:04:10,905
to a generation of young women.

94
00:04:10,906 --> 00:04:13,139
Uh, yes, of-of course, I know.

95
00:04:14,276 --> 00:04:16,110
So, the next words
out of your mouth

96
00:04:16,111 --> 00:04:18,412
should be on a stage in
Stockholm when you're saying...

97
00:04:18,413 --> 00:04:20,147
(speaks Swedish)

98
00:04:20,148 --> 00:04:22,850
...which is Swedish for,
"Thank you for this honor."

99
00:04:22,851 --> 00:04:25,019
(speaks Swedish)

100
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:26,819
...which is Swedish for,
"I knew that."

101
00:04:28,723 --> 00:04:30,224
Dr. Cooper...

102
00:04:30,225 --> 00:04:31,925
You want me to shut my trap?
I do.

103
00:04:34,462 --> 00:04:36,363
Hey, check it out.

104
00:04:36,364 --> 00:04:39,266
That looks like the moped
you used to have.

105
00:04:39,267 --> 00:04:41,602
It wasn't a moped.
It was a scooter.

106
00:04:41,603 --> 00:04:43,771
How's that better?
(scoffs)

107
00:04:43,772 --> 00:04:45,839
You do not want to walk
into a scooter bar

108
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:47,875
and ask that question.

109
00:04:47,876 --> 00:04:50,311
Well, does
take me back.

110
00:04:50,312 --> 00:04:53,681
Yeah, the two of us, cruising
around town looking for women.

111
00:04:53,682 --> 00:04:54,848
Looking

112
00:04:54,849 --> 00:04:57,952
and looking and looking.

113
00:04:57,953 --> 00:05:00,587
Remember that time
one looked back and said hi?

114
00:05:00,588 --> 00:05:02,356
Oh, yeah.

115
00:05:02,357 --> 00:05:05,025
We drove away
so fast.

116
00:05:05,026 --> 00:05:08,329
Hey, I forget,
why did you sell the scooter?

117
00:05:08,330 --> 00:05:11,699
I finally got my woman.
(chuckles)

118
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:13,399
Then my woman made me sell it.

119
00:05:16,504 --> 00:05:18,639
So apparently,
if we win,

120
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:21,508
I'll be the fourth woman ever
to win a Nobel in physics.

121
00:05:21,509 --> 00:05:23,510
Wow, that's a big deal.

122
00:05:23,511 --> 00:05:25,112
Yeah, tell me about it.
This morning,

123
00:05:25,113 --> 00:05:28,414
I blew through my antiperspirant
in, like, an hour.

124
00:05:30,585 --> 00:05:33,187
Plus, Sheldon's freaking out
'cause we got in trouble.

125
00:05:33,188 --> 00:05:36,357
Well, I've got him
distracted for a while.

126
00:05:36,358 --> 00:05:38,092
Doesn't he know
how to solve those?

127
00:05:38,093 --> 00:05:42,896
Normally, yes, but I switched
the stickers around, so...

128
00:05:42,897 --> 00:05:45,165
I don't even think
it's possible to solve...

129
00:05:45,166 --> 00:05:46,165
Solved it.

130
00:05:47,969 --> 00:05:49,470
What? No, you didn't.

131
00:05:49,471 --> 00:05:52,639
Not the cube, but the puzzle of
why I couldn't solve the cube.

132
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:53,841
Solution:

133
00:05:53,842 --> 00:05:58,379
you switched stickers
two, nine, 32, and 51.

134
00:05:58,380 --> 00:06:00,214
Really? This thing has numbers?

135
00:06:00,215 --> 00:06:02,249
Anything has a number
if you assign it a number,

136
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:03,182
friend number four.

137
00:06:06,221 --> 00:06:07,488
Top five, not bad.

138
00:06:07,489 --> 00:06:09,123
This is so frustrating.

139
00:06:09,124 --> 00:06:10,657
I can't believe
the university expects us

140
00:06:10,658 --> 00:06:12,192
to just sit back and do nothing.

141
00:06:12,193 --> 00:06:15,229
Sweetie, you just need to relax.
You know what I like to do?

142
00:06:15,230 --> 00:06:17,297
Numb your brain with alcohol
and watch a reality show

143
00:06:17,298 --> 00:06:20,200
where wealthy people pick
fake arguments with each other?

144
00:06:20,201 --> 00:06:22,336
Hey, don't knock it
until you've wasted

145
00:06:22,337 --> 00:06:24,138
a couple hundred hours
of your life.

146
00:06:24,139 --> 00:06:27,508
I'm sorry, but this is,
it's hard for me.

147
00:06:27,509 --> 00:06:29,676
Usually I self-soothe
by doing science,

148
00:06:29,677 --> 00:06:32,346
but now science reminds me
of the Nobel Prize

149
00:06:32,347 --> 00:06:35,149
and the idea that we may not win
one, and that makes me angry,

150
00:06:35,150 --> 00:06:37,017
which makes me want to
self-soothe by doing science,

151
00:06:37,018 --> 00:06:39,853
and on and on and on.

152
00:06:39,854 --> 00:06:41,487
So that's been my today.

153
00:06:43,725 --> 00:06:44,958
Hey, how about a massage?

154
00:06:44,959 --> 00:06:47,127
No, the only person who
touches me is my wife.

155
00:06:47,128 --> 00:06:49,762
And even I have to let him
smell my hand first.

156
00:06:53,635 --> 00:06:55,436
Okay, well,
what about Reiki?

157
00:06:55,437 --> 00:06:57,237
It's like massage
but without touching.

158
00:06:57,238 --> 00:06:58,439
Then what is it?

159
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:00,541
Well, I place my hands
near your body

160
00:07:00,542 --> 00:07:02,776
and allow
the universal energy field

161
00:07:02,777 --> 00:07:04,244
to manifest
its healing powers.

162
00:07:04,245 --> 00:07:05,712
Okay, I know

163
00:07:05,713 --> 00:07:07,681
it sounds crazy, but it
really works; ask Leonard.

164
00:07:07,682 --> 00:07:09,416
(stammers)
It really does.
Yeah.

165
00:07:09,417 --> 00:07:11,150
(mouthing):
No.

166
00:07:13,021 --> 00:07:15,923
Oh, uh, how about a
sensory deprivation tank?

167
00:07:15,924 --> 00:07:18,092
Oh, that's interesting.

168
00:07:18,093 --> 00:07:19,460
It's supposed to be
very calming.

169
00:07:19,461 --> 00:07:21,628
Floating in a warm pool
of liquid

170
00:07:21,629 --> 00:07:23,397
in a dark, soundless space.

171
00:07:23,398 --> 00:07:24,798
Oh, I don't know
how I feel about

172
00:07:24,799 --> 00:07:26,200
being deprived of all my senses.

173
00:07:26,201 --> 00:07:28,669
What are you talking about?
All you ever do is complain

174
00:07:28,670 --> 00:07:30,370
about how things
smell, feel and sound.

175
00:07:30,371 --> 00:07:33,639
Oh, I'm right here.
Why are you shouting?

176
00:07:35,276 --> 00:07:37,744
What do you say?
We could both use a break.

177
00:07:37,745 --> 00:07:39,413
Come on,
I'll do it with you.

178
00:07:39,414 --> 00:07:40,948
Okay, but not
in the same tank.

179
00:07:40,949 --> 00:07:42,950
I already shared a uterus
with my twin sister.

180
00:07:42,951 --> 00:07:44,917
I don't need to go
through that again.

181
00:07:46,321 --> 00:07:48,889
Are your eyes closed?
Yes. What is it? Show me.

182
00:07:48,890 --> 00:07:50,323
Okay, open them.

183
00:07:51,593 --> 00:07:54,661
You bought me
a scooter?!

184
00:07:54,662 --> 00:07:57,664
No, I bought me a scooter!

185
00:07:57,665 --> 00:08:00,667
Then why did you make me
close my eyes?

186
00:08:00,668 --> 00:08:02,536
I wanted to see the expression
on your face

187
00:08:02,537 --> 00:08:04,138
when you saw how happy I was.

188
00:08:04,139 --> 00:08:06,507
Wait, one second.

189
00:08:06,508 --> 00:08:08,609
Won't Bernadette be mad
when she finds out?

190
00:08:08,610 --> 00:08:11,044
She's not gonna. I'm keeping it
here at the university.

191
00:08:11,045 --> 00:08:12,212
Ah.

192
00:08:12,213 --> 00:08:13,881
My dad kept a secret
at work, too,

193
00:08:13,882 --> 00:08:15,983
but it was his receptionist.

194
00:08:15,984 --> 00:08:18,452
Hey, would you mind
if I ride it sometimes?

195
00:08:18,453 --> 00:08:20,387
Yeah, whenever you want.

196
00:08:20,388 --> 00:08:21,388
(engine starts)

197
00:08:21,389 --> 00:08:22,856
(exhales)
Check it out.

198
00:08:22,857 --> 00:08:24,525
(engine revving)

199
00:08:24,526 --> 00:08:26,126
(chuckles) That there, son,

200
00:08:26,127 --> 00:08:29,096
is 12 horses
of "eye-talian" thunder.

201
00:08:29,097 --> 00:08:30,429
(engine revving)

202
00:08:31,833 --> 00:08:35,235
Have either of you done
sensory deprivation before?

203
00:08:35,236 --> 00:08:37,171
No.
Never.

204
00:08:37,172 --> 00:08:38,605
Okay, just a heads up.

205
00:08:38,606 --> 00:08:40,841
People have different
experiences in the tanks.

206
00:08:40,842 --> 00:08:43,076
Uh, some people experience
perfect calm.

207
00:08:43,077 --> 00:08:44,711
Some people sleep.

208
00:08:44,712 --> 00:08:46,180
Some people even reported
having visions.

209
00:08:46,181 --> 00:08:48,448
But if at any time
you feel uncomfortable,

210
00:08:48,449 --> 00:08:50,817
just press the panic button
and say, "Bebe."

211
00:08:50,818 --> 00:08:53,620
(laughs) That's a stupid word.

212
00:08:53,621 --> 00:08:55,154
That's my name.

213
00:08:56,991 --> 00:08:59,960
What do we push if
we feel uncomfortable?

214
00:08:59,961 --> 00:09:01,995
All right, are you ready?

215
00:09:01,996 --> 00:09:03,730
I'm not saying
this is why we came,

216
00:09:03,731 --> 00:09:06,366
but can I close
the lid on him?

217
00:09:06,367 --> 00:09:08,502
No.

218
00:09:08,503 --> 00:09:10,036
No.

219
00:09:12,173 --> 00:09:13,373
Shall we?

220
00:09:13,374 --> 00:09:14,875
(stammers) One second.

221
00:09:14,876 --> 00:09:17,511
Is the pH between
7.2 and 7.8?
Yes.

222
00:09:17,512 --> 00:09:19,746
Is the water drained
and replaced after each use?

223
00:09:19,747 --> 00:09:20,747
Yes.

224
00:09:20,748 --> 00:09:22,849
Is the saline level 30%?
Yes.

225
00:09:22,850 --> 00:09:24,518
Does your filtration system
use ultraviolet light

226
00:09:24,519 --> 00:09:26,386
to kill bacteria?
Yes.

227
00:09:26,387 --> 00:09:29,322
I don't need to get in.
I'm relaxed already.

228
00:09:35,964 --> 00:09:37,730
Bebe.

229
00:09:41,436 --> 00:09:42,936
What's wrong?

230
00:09:42,937 --> 00:09:45,339
Nothing. I just wanted
to make sure it worked.

231
00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:46,974
Also, I changed my mind.

232
00:09:46,975 --> 00:09:48,976
It's fun to say your name.

233
00:09:48,977 --> 00:09:50,577
Bebe. Bebe.

234
00:09:50,578 --> 00:09:53,146
Bebe. Bebe.

235
00:09:53,147 --> 00:09:54,881
Bebe. Bebe.

236
00:09:54,882 --> 00:09:56,183
<i>Bebe.</i>

237
00:09:56,184 --> 00:09:58,851
BERNADETTE:
Hey, what you got there?

238
00:10:01,856 --> 00:10:04,224
Oh. (stammers)

239
00:10:04,225 --> 00:10:07,727
Just tossing out this old
helmet I don't need.

240
00:10:10,465 --> 00:10:12,332
I thought you were at the park.

241
00:10:12,333 --> 00:10:13,567
We were. The kids
got sleepy.

242
00:10:13,568 --> 00:10:16,370
Great story.
I need to make a phone call.

243
00:10:16,371 --> 00:10:18,538
Howard, why do you
look all guilty?

244
00:10:18,539 --> 00:10:21,108
Like when I catch you deleting
your browser history?

245
00:10:21,109 --> 00:10:22,875
(horn honking)

246
00:10:30,551 --> 00:10:32,151
Never mind.

247
00:10:35,590 --> 00:10:38,525
SHELDON:
<i>Hmm, this is nice.</i>

248
00:10:38,526 --> 00:10:41,194
<i>It's sort of like</i>
<i>floating in space.</i>

249
00:10:41,195 --> 00:10:45,065
<i>But better because</i>
<i>my eyeballs haven't frozen.</i>

250
00:10:45,066 --> 00:10:47,334
<i>Ooh, colors.</i>
<i>(relaxing classical music</i>

251
00:10:47,335 --> 00:10:49,169
<i>(gasps)</i>
<i>It's infinite iterations</i>

252
00:10:49,170 --> 00:10:53,373
<i>of the "Nautilus" section</i>
<i>of the Mandelbrot set.</i>

253
00:10:53,374 --> 00:10:55,309
<i>(sighs)</i>

254
00:10:55,310 --> 00:10:58,044
<i>That's some good stuff.</i>
<i>(music stops)</i>

255
00:11:01,015 --> 00:11:04,518
AMY:
<i>Wow, this is really dark.</i>

256
00:11:04,519 --> 00:11:08,221
<i>There's no difference between</i>
<i>my eyes being open or closed.</i>

257
00:11:08,222 --> 00:11:10,390
<i>Open, closed.</i>

258
00:11:10,391 --> 00:11:12,792
<i>Open, clo--</i>
<i>nope, same thing.</i>

259
00:11:14,896 --> 00:11:16,930
<i>Ooh, pretty.</i>

260
00:11:16,931 --> 00:11:21,034
You winning a Nobel Prize would
be an inspiration to all women.

261
00:11:21,035 --> 00:11:24,604
All women, Amy,
and you're blowing it.

262
00:11:24,605 --> 00:11:27,974
I was gonna be a scientist,
but since you lost,

263
00:11:27,975 --> 00:11:30,910
I'm just gonna give
makeup tutorials on YouTube.

264
00:11:34,315 --> 00:11:36,817
<i>(relaxing classical music</i>
<i>playing)</i>

265
00:11:36,818 --> 00:11:39,953
SHELDON:
<i>Look all the infinite</i>
<i>Mandelbrot sets.</i>

266
00:11:39,954 --> 00:11:42,922
<i>Here a brot, there a brot,</i>
<i>everywhere a Mandelbrot.</i>

267
00:11:46,961 --> 00:11:48,762
Thanks for letting us down.

268
00:11:48,763 --> 00:11:51,498
I'm gonna marry a dope
and have his dopey children.

269
00:11:51,499 --> 00:11:53,600
You're such a disappointment.
I can't do science.

270
00:11:53,601 --> 00:11:55,535
Way to not go, girl.
Disappointing.

271
00:11:55,536 --> 00:11:58,705
Math is too hard.
I am woman, hear me bake.

272
00:11:58,706 --> 00:12:00,407
Disappointment.
You're letting us down.

273
00:12:00,408 --> 00:12:02,242
You're letting us down.
You're blowing it.

274
00:12:02,243 --> 00:12:03,844
Disappointment.
You're blowing it.

275
00:12:03,845 --> 00:12:05,978
Mm, mm, mm.

276
00:12:07,448 --> 00:12:10,383
Okay, hour's up.
Let's see how they're doing.

277
00:12:12,186 --> 00:12:14,321
Hey, buddy, how you feeling?

278
00:12:14,322 --> 00:12:15,489
(moans):
Aw.

279
00:12:15,490 --> 00:12:17,823
Five more minutes?

280
00:12:20,661 --> 00:12:22,662
Hey, Amy. Relaxed?

281
00:12:22,663 --> 00:12:25,598
I'm a failure! I can't do this!

282
00:12:27,235 --> 00:12:28,402
Can someone close her lid?

283
00:12:28,403 --> 00:12:29,902
She's kind of
harshing my mellow.

284
00:12:35,084 --> 00:12:37,085
That tank was amazing.

285
00:12:37,086 --> 00:12:40,822
It was like Disneyland, but
the rides were in 35 dimensions.

286
00:12:40,823 --> 00:12:42,824
And instead of Mickey,
I had my picture taken

287
00:12:42,825 --> 00:12:44,958
with the concept
that time is an illusion.

288
00:12:47,096 --> 00:12:49,998
That's great.
I'm so happy for you.

289
00:12:49,999 --> 00:12:52,300
Uh, yeah, a little
constructive criticism:

290
00:12:52,301 --> 00:12:56,304
You're saying you're happy, but
you're using your mean voice.

291
00:12:56,305 --> 00:12:58,106
Thanks for pointing that out.

292
00:12:58,107 --> 00:13:00,241
Now you got it.

293
00:13:00,242 --> 00:13:02,944
Sheldon, I'm freaking out.

294
00:13:02,945 --> 00:13:05,179
Well, is this still
about the Nobel Prize?

295
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:06,848
Yes, it's about the Nobel Prize!

296
00:13:06,849 --> 00:13:08,616
And back to the mean voice.

297
00:13:08,617 --> 00:13:12,120
It's just--
it's too much pressure.

298
00:13:12,121 --> 00:13:14,956
You know? It was bad enough
when I was letting us down.

299
00:13:14,957 --> 00:13:17,925
But now, if I don't win, it's
like I'm letting all women down.

300
00:13:17,926 --> 00:13:19,127
Hang on.

301
00:13:19,128 --> 00:13:20,628
What-what are you doing?

302
00:13:20,629 --> 00:13:23,164
I'm googling what to do
when someone's freaking out.

303
00:13:23,165 --> 00:13:25,366
Huh.

304
00:13:25,367 --> 00:13:27,035
Uh, whoa, it says here

305
00:13:27,036 --> 00:13:29,671
that a walk can be calming.

306
00:13:29,672 --> 00:13:31,538
Bye.

307
00:13:37,012 --> 00:13:39,180
Hey.

308
00:13:39,181 --> 00:13:40,682
You still mad?

309
00:13:40,683 --> 00:13:43,317
Are you still a jackass?

310
00:13:43,318 --> 00:13:45,586
Now, now, I asked you first.

311
00:13:45,587 --> 00:13:47,789
I can't believe you were

312
00:13:47,790 --> 00:13:49,724
sneaking around my back
like a child.

313
00:13:49,725 --> 00:13:52,126
(scoffs) I just didn't
want you to worry.

314
00:13:52,127 --> 00:13:54,362
No, you just didn't
want to get caught.

315
00:13:54,363 --> 00:13:56,898
I'm sorry, but you telling me
what I can and can't do

316
00:13:56,899 --> 00:13:58,499
is pretty damn emasculating.

317
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:00,001
Emasculating?

318
00:14:00,002 --> 00:14:04,071
You were about to ride bitch
on a moped with another man.

319
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:07,241
It's a scooter.

320
00:14:07,242 --> 00:14:10,711
It can go on some highways.

321
00:14:12,314 --> 00:14:13,748
What if you fell?

322
00:14:13,749 --> 00:14:15,249
What if you got hurt?

323
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:17,118
I don't want to raise
two small children

324
00:14:17,119 --> 00:14:20,088
and one large vegetable.

325
00:14:20,089 --> 00:14:22,256
I'm sorry, but I need to have
something in my life

326
00:14:22,257 --> 00:14:24,692
that reminds me I'm still a man.
You do.

327
00:14:24,693 --> 00:14:28,029
You have a wife and two children
who need their father.

328
00:14:28,030 --> 00:14:29,497
I know that.

329
00:14:29,498 --> 00:14:32,066
Uh, well, you don't act like it.

330
00:14:32,067 --> 00:14:34,902
Why do you want to ride
that stupid thing anyway?

331
00:14:34,903 --> 00:14:37,171
I don't know.

332
00:14:37,172 --> 00:14:41,776
Maybe I just miss the freedom
I had as a younger man.

333
00:14:41,777 --> 00:14:44,611
What freedom?
You lived with your mother.

334
00:14:46,014 --> 00:14:49,250
You had a curfew.

335
00:14:49,251 --> 00:14:51,753
It wasn't a curfew;
it was just a time of night

336
00:14:51,754 --> 00:14:55,256
where if I got home after that,
she would be mad.

337
00:14:55,257 --> 00:14:57,458
You know what?
I'm done talking about this.

338
00:14:57,459 --> 00:14:59,594
Do whatever you want.
I will!

339
00:14:59,595 --> 00:15:02,463
I just want you to ask yourself
if that tiny, ridiculous scooter

340
00:15:02,464 --> 00:15:05,198
is the hill you want to die on.

341
00:15:07,002 --> 00:15:09,270
(engine revving)

342
00:15:09,271 --> 00:15:12,874
Oh, yeah, this feels good.

343
00:15:12,875 --> 00:15:14,975
Born to ride, buddy.

344
00:15:16,245 --> 00:15:18,579
Yeah, watch out, ladies.

345
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:20,081
All right, well, wish me luck.

346
00:15:20,082 --> 00:15:21,816
You won't need luck.

347
00:15:21,817 --> 00:15:23,817
Yeah, only condoms.

348
00:15:27,990 --> 00:15:29,923
He sees that car, right?

349
00:15:32,728 --> 00:15:36,430
I tried to console her,
but nothing seemed to work.

350
00:15:36,431 --> 00:15:39,267
Okay, when you say
you consoled her,

351
00:15:39,268 --> 00:15:41,102
what exactly
does that mean?

352
00:15:41,103 --> 00:15:43,771
(sighs)
I took a walk, I came back,

353
00:15:43,772 --> 00:15:46,840
she was still upset,
so I came here.

354
00:15:48,477 --> 00:15:51,946
Well, I don't see
what else you could've done.

355
00:15:51,947 --> 00:15:55,583
You know, I know she's unhappy,
but I don't know how to help.

356
00:15:55,584 --> 00:15:56,751
LEONARD:
Maybe you can't.

357
00:15:56,752 --> 00:15:58,252
Sometimes people are upset,

358
00:15:58,253 --> 00:16:00,855
and all you can do
is be there for them.

359
00:16:00,856 --> 00:16:04,025
And while I'm there,
what do I do?

360
00:16:04,026 --> 00:16:05,760
Nothing.

361
00:16:05,761 --> 00:16:09,596
Oh, so like what you're doing
right now to help me.

362
00:16:10,766 --> 00:16:13,167
You're up.
(grunts)

363
00:16:13,168 --> 00:16:15,002
Sheldon, maybe you
don't know what to do

364
00:16:15,003 --> 00:16:17,772
because Amy's always
taking care of you.

365
00:16:17,773 --> 00:16:20,274
Of course.

366
00:16:20,275 --> 00:16:23,010
And by calming down,
I've taken away the one thing

367
00:16:23,011 --> 00:16:25,812
that gives her comfort:
caring for me.

368
00:16:27,883 --> 00:16:29,951
That's what you heard?

369
00:16:29,952 --> 00:16:32,053
Yes.

370
00:16:32,054 --> 00:16:33,321
No, I need to have

371
00:16:33,322 --> 00:16:35,122
an emotional meltdown
so she's forced

372
00:16:35,123 --> 00:16:37,491
to focus on me
and forget about herself.

373
00:16:37,492 --> 00:16:40,294
No. Th-That's not
even close to what--

374
00:16:40,295 --> 00:16:43,029
Uh, you know, actually, that
might be your best move. Yeah.

375
00:16:44,333 --> 00:16:47,335
Amy. Thank goodness
you're home.

376
00:16:47,336 --> 00:16:49,704
I don't know if you can tell,
but I am literally

377
00:16:49,705 --> 00:16:51,906
losing my mind.
You are?

378
00:16:51,907 --> 00:16:55,075
Isn't it obvious? I just used
"literally" figuratively.

379
00:16:56,411 --> 00:16:58,746
Like a crazy person.

380
00:16:58,747 --> 00:17:01,449
What is going on with you?
Are you okay?

381
00:17:01,450 --> 00:17:04,051
No, I am not okay, so I suggest
you start focusing on me

382
00:17:04,052 --> 00:17:05,586
to the exclusion of
your own feelings.

383
00:17:05,587 --> 00:17:08,089
Sheldon, whatever you're doing,

384
00:17:08,090 --> 00:17:10,056
I-I don't have time
for it right now.

385
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:13,094
I'm sorry.
I know you're upset,

386
00:17:13,095 --> 00:17:15,096
but I don't know
how to make it better.

387
00:17:15,097 --> 00:17:17,297
I don't know
how you can, either.

388
00:17:18,367 --> 00:17:20,167
I mean, I don't know
if anybody can.

389
00:17:20,168 --> 00:17:21,636
I just--

390
00:17:21,637 --> 00:17:24,471
I feel like I'm letting
everybody down.

391
00:17:33,181 --> 00:17:37,117
I'm about to hold you. Would you
like to smell my hand first?

392
00:17:40,822 --> 00:17:42,589
I'm fine.

393
00:17:48,196 --> 00:17:49,797
(sighs)

394
00:17:49,798 --> 00:17:51,731
Thank you.

395
00:17:54,536 --> 00:17:57,338
? Soft kitty, warm kitty ?

396
00:17:57,339 --> 00:17:59,740
? Little ball of fur ?

397
00:17:59,741 --> 00:18:02,443
? Happy kitty, sleepy kitty ?

398
00:18:02,444 --> 00:18:04,912
? Purr, purr, purr ?

399
00:18:04,913 --> 00:18:06,414
That helps.

400
00:18:06,415 --> 00:18:09,150
Shh, I'm singing.
Oh.

401
00:18:09,151 --> 00:18:11,452
? Soft kitty, warm kitty ?

402
00:18:11,453 --> 00:18:12,719
? Little ball of fur... ?

403
00:18:20,028 --> 00:18:22,662
Raj said you got $800.

404
00:18:25,067 --> 00:18:27,000
Jerk.

405
00:18:29,538 --> 00:18:32,306
On a positive note, the scooter
helped Bert meet a girl.

406
00:18:32,307 --> 00:18:34,709
Oh, that's nice.
What does she do?

407
00:18:34,710 --> 00:18:37,445
She's an E.R. nurse.

408
00:18:37,446 --> 00:18:39,680
Oh, no.
No.

409
00:18:39,681 --> 00:18:40,848
It was a real meet-cute.

410
00:18:40,849 --> 00:18:42,750
She popped his arm
back in the socket,

411
00:18:42,751 --> 00:18:45,953
and when he came to,
they exchanged phone numbers.

412
00:18:45,954 --> 00:18:47,387
Aw.

413
00:18:49,825 --> 00:18:50,992
(knock on door)

414
00:18:50,993 --> 00:18:51,993
Ms. Davis?

415
00:18:51,994 --> 00:18:54,161
Dr. Fowler, how can I help you?

416
00:18:54,162 --> 00:18:57,898
You were right about this Nobel
Prize being bigger than I am,

417
00:18:57,899 --> 00:18:59,133
and you were right

418
00:18:59,134 --> 00:19:01,402
that, like it or not,
I am a role model.

419
00:19:01,403 --> 00:19:04,071
But you are wrong
to keep me on the sidelines.

420
00:19:04,072 --> 00:19:07,742
I am smart, I'm capable,
and I can make a difference.

421
00:19:07,743 --> 00:19:11,212
Well said.
You make a strong case.

422
00:19:11,213 --> 00:19:12,947
Damn right,
'cause I'm a strong woman

423
00:19:12,948 --> 00:19:15,015
wearing
a strong man's deodorant!

424
00:19:17,085 --> 00:19:19,186
Well, how about have a seat?

425
00:19:19,187 --> 00:19:21,389
Maybe you'd like
a glass of water?

426
00:19:21,390 --> 00:19:24,158
You have anything with
a little more kick?

427
00:19:24,159 --> 00:19:27,528
Seriously, Dr. Fowler,
this is human resources.

428
00:19:27,529 --> 00:19:28,829
You're right.

429
00:19:28,836 --> 00:19:30,669
I-I don't know
what I was thinking.

430
00:19:30,671 --> 00:19:34,467

You want ice,
you're out of luck.
