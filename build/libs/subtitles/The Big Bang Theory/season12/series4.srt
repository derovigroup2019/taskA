1
00:00:01,698 --> 00:00:03,097
Hey, whatcha doing?

2
00:00:03,166 --> 00:00:05,099
Improving
our wedding photos.

3
00:00:05,168 --> 00:00:06,434
Oh, that's nice.

4
00:00:06,503 --> 00:00:09,003
Wait, I'm still in them, right?

5
00:00:09,072 --> 00:00:11,172
Of course.
And not only you.

6
00:00:11,241 --> 00:00:13,708
I've added some guests
who couldn't be there.

7
00:00:14,811 --> 00:00:16,778
Who's that next
to my father?

8
00:00:16,847 --> 00:00:18,847
The Wright brothers.

9
00:00:18,915 --> 00:00:20,915
And why are they at our wedding?

10
00:00:20,984 --> 00:00:22,750
Orville, because I admire him;

11
00:00:22,819 --> 00:00:24,786
Wilbur, because he was
Orville's plus-one.

12
00:00:26,189 --> 00:00:27,889
Oh.

13
00:00:27,958 --> 00:00:29,991
You got an e-mail
from someone named Tam.

14
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:31,893
Tam? What does <i>he</i> want?

15
00:00:31,962 --> 00:00:33,661
Uh...

16
00:00:33,730 --> 00:00:36,664
looks like he's coming to give
his son a tour of Caltech.

17
00:00:36,733 --> 00:00:38,433
He's hoping you guys
can meet up.

18
00:00:38,502 --> 00:00:40,301
He would like that, wouldn't he?

19
00:00:40,370 --> 00:00:42,971
Well, that is the gist
of the e-mail.

20
00:00:44,107 --> 00:00:45,107
Who's Tam?

21
00:00:45,141 --> 00:00:46,407
He was my best friend

22
00:00:46,476 --> 00:00:48,176
in the whole world growing up.

23
00:00:48,245 --> 00:00:50,879
Really? Why have I never
heard you mention him before?

24
00:00:50,947 --> 00:00:53,414
Oh, of course I have.
I'm sure I've mentioned him,

25
00:00:53,483 --> 00:00:54,916
like, five times this week.

26
00:00:54,985 --> 00:00:56,484
I don't think you have.

27
00:00:56,553 --> 00:00:59,087
Tam! Tam! Tam! Tam! Tam!
There, it's only Thursday.

28
00:01:02,158 --> 00:01:03,428
I didn't just drink the crazy
milk, I bought the crazy cow.

00:01:33,734 --> 00:01:36,368
So, are you actually engaged
to this woman you just met?

40
00:01:36,437 --> 00:01:37,437
Yeah.

41
00:01:37,504 --> 00:01:40,172
Tell us the truth.
Did she get you pregnant?

42
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:42,007
Very funny.

43
00:01:42,076 --> 00:01:43,909
Guys, I need your help, okay?
I'm trying

44
00:01:43,978 --> 00:01:45,077
to buy her
engagement ring.

45
00:01:45,145 --> 00:01:46,311
What do you
think of this?

46
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:47,746
Do you think she'll
like this one?

47
00:01:47,815 --> 00:01:50,215
Well, it's hard to say,
not knowing much about her.

48
00:01:50,284 --> 00:01:51,850
Does she have fingers?

49
00:01:52,853 --> 00:01:54,086
Yes, she has ten fingers

50
00:01:54,154 --> 00:01:56,021
and ten toes.
Probably.

51
00:01:56,090 --> 00:01:58,790
I'll get back to you
after I see her in sandals.

52
00:01:58,859 --> 00:02:01,293
Hey, did you guys know
that Sheldon had

53
00:02:01,362 --> 00:02:03,929
a best friend growing up
named Tam?

54
00:02:03,998 --> 00:02:06,832
Was that the imaginary
talking koala?

55
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:10,635
No. He's a real person
who apparently betrayed him.

56
00:02:10,704 --> 00:02:12,838
Yeah, so did the koala.

57
00:02:12,906 --> 00:02:14,773
I tried to ask him
about it,

58
00:02:14,842 --> 00:02:16,775
and he invoked section three,
article five

59
00:02:16,844 --> 00:02:20,012
of the marriage contract:
beeswax comma none of your.

60
00:02:21,181 --> 00:02:22,781
I can't pry.
I mean,

61
00:02:22,850 --> 00:02:24,216
I have to respect his wishes.

62
00:02:24,284 --> 00:02:26,785
Wow. I wonder
what that guy could've done

63
00:02:26,854 --> 00:02:29,755
to make Sheldon
not talk to him for 20 years.

64
00:02:29,823 --> 00:02:31,823
I wonder if it'd work
a second time.

65
00:02:36,463 --> 00:02:39,097
I'm pumping!

66
00:02:39,166 --> 00:02:40,499
It's Penny.

67
00:02:40,567 --> 00:02:41,833
Oh. Come in.

68
00:02:41,902 --> 00:02:44,136
I thought you were pumping.

69
00:02:44,204 --> 00:02:46,471
I thought you were my boss.

70
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:49,149
Okay, listen, I'm really worried
about this whole Raj thing.

71
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:51,943
I know, he's so desperate
to get married, which is weird,

72
00:02:52,012 --> 00:02:53,287
because I can't imagine
we make it look that great.

73
00:02:53,311 --> 00:02:55,073
I know, right? You know,

74
00:02:55,074 --> 00:02:56,715
if this woman's
gonna be around, I think

75
00:02:56,784 --> 00:02:57,927
we should check her out
a little.

76
00:02:57,951 --> 00:02:59,763
I looked online.
She doesn't have an Instagram,

77
00:02:59,787 --> 00:03:02,387
which means she's either 80
or something's wrong with her.

78
00:03:02,456 --> 00:03:04,589
Well, I could ask my dad.

79
00:03:04,658 --> 00:03:06,858
Maybe he can get some
of his old cop buddies

80
00:03:06,927 --> 00:03:08,560
to do a background
check on her.

81
00:03:08,629 --> 00:03:10,262
- Would he do that?
- Of course.

82
00:03:10,330 --> 00:03:13,031
He's a retired cop
who plays by his own rules.

83
00:03:14,868 --> 00:03:15,734
Hi, Daddy.

84
00:03:15,803 --> 00:03:16,735
No, everything's good.

85
00:03:16,804 --> 00:03:18,070
I just have a favor to ask.

86
00:03:18,138 --> 00:03:19,371
Yeah, so, my friend Raj

87
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:20,950
is marrying this woman
that he barely knows,

88
00:03:20,974 --> 00:03:23,075
and I wanted to see if you
could use your connections

89
00:03:23,143 --> 00:03:24,443
to dig up any dirt on her.

90
00:03:24,511 --> 00:03:25,911
Uh-huh.

91
00:03:25,979 --> 00:03:27,379
Sure.

92
00:03:27,448 --> 00:03:29,915
Okay. Love you.

93
00:03:29,983 --> 00:03:30,566
Is he in?

94
00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:32,671
Absolutely not. He won't do it.
It's totally illegal.

95
00:03:34,192 --> 00:03:36,755
I thought you said
he played by his own rules.

96
00:03:36,824 --> 00:03:38,568
He does, but apparently,
they're very similar

97
00:03:38,592 --> 00:03:40,158
to the actual rules.

98
00:03:42,529 --> 00:03:44,529
I still can't believe
Sheldon had a best friend

99
00:03:44,598 --> 00:03:45,764
we've never
heard about.

100
00:03:45,833 --> 00:03:49,101
Ooh, somebody's <i>jealous.</i>

101
00:03:49,169 --> 00:03:51,369
- I'm not jealous.
- Leonard,

102
00:03:51,438 --> 00:03:54,139
this is a safe space...
it's okay to be vulnerable.

103
00:03:54,208 --> 00:03:55,640
All I'm saying is

104
00:03:55,709 --> 00:03:58,076
you know the timing
of a fellow's bowel movements,

105
00:03:58,145 --> 00:04:01,079
you don't think there's
a lot left to discover.

106
00:04:02,483 --> 00:04:04,182
I wonder what Tam
could have done.

107
00:04:04,251 --> 00:04:06,291
Hmm. Well, if Sheldon doesn't
want to talk about it,

108
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:07,786
it's got to be
pretty upsetting.

109
00:04:07,855 --> 00:04:10,555
I have his brother George's
number... he might know.

110
00:04:10,624 --> 00:04:12,124
Really?
You have George's number?

111
00:04:12,192 --> 00:04:14,459
So so <i>jealous.</i>

112
00:04:17,464 --> 00:04:18,697
Yeah, sure, I remember Tam,

113
00:04:18,765 --> 00:04:21,800
Sheldon's little Vietnam buddy.

114
00:04:21,869 --> 00:04:24,302
The two of them were
always running around together.

115
00:04:24,371 --> 00:04:25,604
So, what happened?

116
00:04:25,672 --> 00:04:26,672
What do you mean?

117
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:28,540
Well, I mean, Sheldon
never talks about him.

118
00:04:28,609 --> 00:04:30,775
They haven't spoken in years.
He wasn't at the wedding.

119
00:04:30,844 --> 00:04:32,043
He wasn't?

120
00:04:32,112 --> 00:04:33,745
All right, well,
this is embarrassing,

121
00:04:33,814 --> 00:04:35,413
'cause I had a long conversation

122
00:04:35,482 --> 00:04:38,049
with someone
who I thought was Tam.

123
00:04:38,118 --> 00:04:41,419
Wait, wait, so you don't know
what their fight was about?

124
00:04:41,488 --> 00:04:42,954
I wish I could help you, boys.

125
00:04:43,023 --> 00:04:45,090
But, you know,
Sheldon used to keep

126
00:04:45,159 --> 00:04:47,359
an enemies list
when he was a kid.

127
00:04:47,427 --> 00:04:48,360
Oh, he still does.

128
00:04:48,428 --> 00:04:49,428
Really? I figured

129
00:04:49,463 --> 00:04:50,595
that went the same way

130
00:04:50,664 --> 00:04:51,997
as his bathroom schedule.

131
00:04:52,065 --> 00:04:55,400
If you mean digitized, annotated
and put online, it did.

132
00:04:55,469 --> 00:04:57,636
Maybe that'll tell you
something.

133
00:04:57,704 --> 00:05:00,639
Hey, while you're looking at it,
if I'm still on there

134
00:05:00,707 --> 00:05:02,340
for peeing
in his shampoo bottle...

135
00:05:02,409 --> 00:05:04,276
Eh, you know what,
just leave it.

136
00:05:04,344 --> 00:05:06,678
- See ya, boys.
- Bye.

137
00:05:06,747 --> 00:05:08,680
- Bye.
- All right, got his enemies list.

138
00:05:08,749 --> 00:05:10,282
Ooh, he updated
the interface.

139
00:05:10,350 --> 00:05:11,950
You can search
by first name,

140
00:05:12,019 --> 00:05:14,853
last name or length of grudge.

141
00:05:14,922 --> 00:05:16,454
Is Tam on it?

142
00:05:16,523 --> 00:05:17,989
Let's see.

143
00:05:18,058 --> 00:05:19,858
Yep. Right here.
Tam Nguyen.

144
00:05:19,927 --> 00:05:21,626
- Oh, great. What did he do?
- Hold on.

145
00:05:21,695 --> 00:05:24,062
I have to agree
to the terms of service.

146
00:05:25,465 --> 00:05:27,432
No, I'm not a robot.

147
00:05:28,468 --> 00:05:29,734
Okay.

148
00:05:29,803 --> 00:05:31,803
"Which of these are plants?"

149
00:05:31,872 --> 00:05:33,205
And we're in.

150
00:05:33,273 --> 00:05:35,207
Great. What-what
does it say?

151
00:05:35,275 --> 00:05:36,374
Well...

152
00:05:36,443 --> 00:05:38,109
"He knows what he did."

153
00:05:38,178 --> 00:05:39,878
Oh, come on.

154
00:05:39,947 --> 00:05:42,380
Wait. Wait, wait,
wait, if Tam knows

155
00:05:42,449 --> 00:05:44,349
what he did, we
can just ask him.

156
00:05:44,418 --> 00:05:46,751
He's gonna be on campus tomorrow
showing his son around.

157
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:48,053
Won't that make Sheldon mad?

158
00:05:48,121 --> 00:05:49,688
Everything makes
Sheldon mad.

159
00:05:49,756 --> 00:05:51,690
- Yeah.
- Look at his list.

160
00:05:51,758 --> 00:05:53,425
Jim Henson for, quote,

161
00:05:53,493 --> 00:05:56,328
"putting a terrifying,
giant yellow bird on television

162
00:05:56,396 --> 00:05:59,264
and in my nightmares."

163
00:06:03,170 --> 00:06:05,971
- Oh, this is so nice.
- Mm-hmm.

164
00:06:06,039 --> 00:06:08,440
Maybe instead of introducing
ourselves to Anu,

165
00:06:08,508 --> 00:06:10,375
we could just get a room,

166
00:06:10,444 --> 00:06:12,510
order some food and take a nap.

167
00:06:12,579 --> 00:06:14,579
Yeah, I've fallen
for that line before.

168
00:06:14,648 --> 00:06:16,615
It never leads
to napping.

169
00:06:16,683 --> 00:06:18,917
That must be her.

170
00:06:18,986 --> 00:06:21,319
Oh. She's cute.

171
00:06:21,388 --> 00:06:23,488
Okay, I got you two seats
to <i>Hamilton</i> tonight.

172
00:06:23,557 --> 00:06:25,690
Your tickets will be
at the concierge desk.

173
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:27,359
Of course.
My pleasure.

174
00:06:27,427 --> 00:06:28,893
May I help you?

175
00:06:28,962 --> 00:06:30,640
Yes, I'm here to pick up
our <i>Hamilton</i> tickets.

176
00:06:30,664 --> 00:06:32,764
Stop.

177
00:06:33,967 --> 00:06:34,967
Hi. We're Raj's friends.

178
00:06:35,002 --> 00:06:36,368
I'm Penny.
This is Bernadette.

179
00:06:36,436 --> 00:06:38,470
We just came by to
introduce ourselves.

180
00:06:38,538 --> 00:06:40,071
So you came to check me out?

181
00:06:40,173 --> 00:06:43,108
She's smart.
I like her.

182
00:06:43,176 --> 00:06:44,387
We just want to see
if we could take you

183
00:06:44,411 --> 00:06:45,688
to dinner
and get to know you a bit.

184
00:06:45,712 --> 00:06:48,013
That sounds nice.
How about tonight after work?

185
00:06:48,081 --> 00:06:49,714
Maybe we can go to Bavel.

186
00:06:49,783 --> 00:06:52,183
Oh, I wish. That place is
impossible to get into.

187
00:06:52,252 --> 00:06:54,185
Oh, please.
Getting into impossible places

188
00:06:54,254 --> 00:06:55,987
is my superpower.

189
00:06:56,056 --> 00:06:57,222
Me, too.

190
00:06:57,291 --> 00:07:00,825
I can fit my whole body
in our dryer.

191
00:07:00,894 --> 00:07:02,661
All set. 8:30.

192
00:07:02,729 --> 00:07:04,729
Wow. Okay, well,
we'll see you tonight.

193
00:07:04,798 --> 00:07:05,798
- See you then.
- Okay.

194
00:07:05,866 --> 00:07:07,065
Bye.

195
00:07:07,134 --> 00:07:09,234
She can get
into any restaurant,

196
00:07:09,303 --> 00:07:12,937
but the best husband
she can find is Raj?

197
00:07:16,043 --> 00:07:17,709
Not Tam.

198
00:07:18,812 --> 00:07:20,178
Not Tam.

199
00:07:21,281 --> 00:07:22,981
Not Tam.

200
00:07:23,050 --> 00:07:25,150
Got him.

201
00:07:25,218 --> 00:07:27,485
- Tam Nguyen?
- Yeah. Yes.

202
00:07:27,554 --> 00:07:29,754
Is my son done
with his tour?

203
00:07:29,823 --> 00:07:33,591
No idea. We're actually
friends of Sheldon Cooper.

204
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:35,460
Oh, I've been trying
to get in touch with him,

205
00:07:35,495 --> 00:07:36,995
but I never heard back.
Is he okay?

206
00:07:37,064 --> 00:07:39,030
Well, if you mean
physically, yes.

207
00:07:39,099 --> 00:07:41,866
If you mean
every other way, no.

208
00:07:41,935 --> 00:07:43,401
- So, is he here?
- Uh, no.

209
00:07:43,470 --> 00:07:44,703
He-he didn't come.

210
00:07:44,771 --> 00:07:45,837
He's, uh...

211
00:07:45,906 --> 00:07:48,840
he's still pretty
upset about...

212
00:07:48,909 --> 00:07:50,508
you know.

213
00:07:50,577 --> 00:07:52,010
I know what?

214
00:07:52,079 --> 00:07:53,611
Come on,

215
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:55,146
you-you must know.

216
00:07:55,215 --> 00:07:57,782
No, we haven't talked in,
like, 20 years.

217
00:07:57,851 --> 00:08:00,018
Right. Because...

218
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:01,853
you know.

219
00:08:02,889 --> 00:08:05,557
I don't think
he knows.

220
00:08:05,625 --> 00:08:06,905
What are you guys talking about?

221
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:09,394
Why did you and Sheldon
stop being friends?

222
00:08:09,463 --> 00:08:11,162
- What did you do?
- And don't worry,

223
00:08:11,231 --> 00:08:12,530
even though we
just met you,

224
00:08:12,599 --> 00:08:15,266
we think you're right
and he's wrong.

225
00:08:15,335 --> 00:08:17,001
I didn't do anything.

226
00:08:17,070 --> 00:08:19,637
He moved to California,
and we just drifted apart.

227
00:08:19,706 --> 00:08:22,040
Oh, come on, there's
got to be something...

228
00:08:22,109 --> 00:08:24,042
- Oh, hey, Sheldon.

229
00:08:24,111 --> 00:08:26,611
- We just met...
- Sheldon! So good to see you!

230
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:28,413
Tam.

231
00:08:29,516 --> 00:08:31,349
It's been a long time.

232
00:08:31,418 --> 00:08:33,918
Mm, not long enough
to erase the sting of betrayal.

233
00:08:33,987 --> 00:08:35,320
How did I betray you?

234
00:08:35,389 --> 00:08:37,222
You know what you did.

235
00:08:37,290 --> 00:08:39,190
Uh, let me
catch you up.

236
00:08:39,259 --> 00:08:40,759
He does not.

237
00:08:42,095 --> 00:08:44,562
When I moved to California,
what did you do?

238
00:08:44,631 --> 00:08:45,930
I stayed in Texas.

239
00:08:45,999 --> 00:08:47,632
Do you believe this guy?!

240
00:08:51,405 --> 00:08:54,406
So, he was your best friend
growing up?

241
00:08:54,474 --> 00:08:55,407
Yes.

242
00:08:55,475 --> 00:08:57,575
Were there no other kids
in Texas?

243
00:09:03,298 --> 00:09:05,832
Hey. What is
going on with you?

244
00:09:06,824 --> 00:09:07,956
I don't want to talk about it.

245
00:09:07,957 --> 00:09:11,026
Well, I'm sure you have
a perfectly stupid reason.

246
00:09:11,629 --> 00:09:14,463
I don't do anything
for a stupid reason.

247
00:09:14,531 --> 00:09:16,431
Except, perhaps,
Talk Like a Pirate Day,

248
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:18,381
and I'd argue that's
more whimsical than stupid.

249
00:09:18,556 --> 00:09:21,624
You know, I was curious to find
out what Tam had done wrong.

250
00:09:21,693 --> 00:09:23,893
Why am I not surprised
the answer is nothing?

251
00:09:23,962 --> 00:09:25,995
So you're taking his side.

252
00:09:26,064 --> 00:09:27,764
You scurvy dog.

253
00:09:29,401 --> 00:09:31,345
You watch yourself.
There is room on my enemies list

254
00:09:31,369 --> 00:09:32,947
now that the cafeteria ladies
finally told me

255
00:09:32,971 --> 00:09:34,304
what's in the chili.

256
00:09:35,407 --> 00:09:37,373
By the way, don't eat the chili.

257
00:09:37,442 --> 00:09:38,641
Wai-Wai-Wait, you know what?

258
00:09:38,710 --> 00:09:40,910
Do.

259
00:09:40,979 --> 00:09:42,679
Be careful, Sheldon.

260
00:09:42,747 --> 00:09:45,026
I don't think you can afford
to lose a second best friend.

261
00:09:45,050 --> 00:09:47,350
I don't see anyone lining up
to be your third.

262
00:09:47,419 --> 00:09:49,652
D... Wait.

263
00:09:49,721 --> 00:09:52,455
"Snarky comebacks..."

264
00:09:52,524 --> 00:09:54,257
Oh, here we go.

265
00:09:54,326 --> 00:09:56,492
"You have your entire life
to be a jerk,

266
00:09:56,561 --> 00:09:59,128
why not take today off?"

267
00:10:03,168 --> 00:10:06,669
That was harsh,
but he was asking for it.

268
00:10:08,106 --> 00:10:09,439
This place is amazing.

269
00:10:09,507 --> 00:10:10,973
I can't believe
you got us in here.

270
00:10:11,042 --> 00:10:12,475
Well, it's kind of my job.

271
00:10:12,544 --> 00:10:15,411
Usually I get tipped for it,
but I'll leave that up to you.

272
00:10:17,482 --> 00:10:19,015
Look, I think that's
LeBron over there.

273
00:10:19,084 --> 00:10:20,016
James?

274
00:10:20,085 --> 00:10:21,617
No, LeBron Kershenbaum.

275
00:10:23,455 --> 00:10:24,787
So, what do you want to know?

276
00:10:24,856 --> 00:10:27,924
Well, you seem like a
smart, successful woman,

277
00:10:27,992 --> 00:10:30,293
why would you want to marry
someone you just met?

278
00:10:30,362 --> 00:10:31,994
Fair question.

279
00:10:32,063 --> 00:10:34,330
In my 20s, I tried this
the normal way.

280
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:36,065
You know, met a guy,
fell in love,

281
00:10:36,134 --> 00:10:37,700
we moved in together.

282
00:10:37,769 --> 00:10:40,403
I put him through culinary
school, screenwriting classes,

283
00:10:40,472 --> 00:10:43,740
and finally dumped him when he
wanted to become a midwife.

284
00:10:43,808 --> 00:10:45,508
Then I realized,

285
00:10:45,577 --> 00:10:48,411
my parents are happy;
they had an arranged marriage.

286
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,213
Why am I fighting this?

287
00:10:50,281 --> 00:10:52,415
I dunno, I married for love

288
00:10:52,484 --> 00:10:56,419
and it turned out... fine.

289
00:10:58,356 --> 00:11:01,324
Oh, yeah, me, too.

290
00:11:03,895 --> 00:11:05,361
Hi.

291
00:11:05,430 --> 00:11:08,030
Howard, today
is your lucky day.

292
00:11:08,099 --> 00:11:09,932
Leonard's out, you're my new
best friend.

293
00:11:11,302 --> 00:11:12,546
Well, I'm not
thrilled about it either,

294
00:11:12,570 --> 00:11:13,936
but here we are.

295
00:11:14,005 --> 00:11:15,471
Okay, fine.

296
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:16,773
Is Bernadette there?

297
00:11:16,841 --> 00:11:17,974
Sh... No.

298
00:11:18,042 --> 00:11:19,442
Just Stuart?

299
00:11:19,511 --> 00:11:21,611
Let me call you back.

300
00:11:21,679 --> 00:11:22,845
Let me guess.

301
00:11:22,914 --> 00:11:24,514
This thing with Tam escalated,

302
00:11:24,582 --> 00:11:25,748
and now you're mad at Leonard

303
00:11:25,817 --> 00:11:27,350
and looking for
a new best friend?

304
00:11:27,419 --> 00:11:29,152
You know me so well.

305
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:31,421
It's too bad you can't be
my best friend.

306
00:11:31,489 --> 00:11:33,055
I can be.

307
00:11:33,124 --> 00:11:35,324
You can't be my wife
and my best friend.

308
00:11:35,393 --> 00:11:37,427
Who would I complain
about you to?

309
00:11:37,495 --> 00:11:39,862
Just tell me what happened.

310
00:11:39,931 --> 00:11:43,399
Leonard talked to Tam behind
my back and took his side.

311
00:11:43,468 --> 00:11:45,802
And after what he did to me.
Can you believe it?

312
00:11:45,870 --> 00:11:48,971
No. I'm-I'm shocked
and outraged.

313
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:51,641
Now, tell me why
I'm shocked and outraged.

314
00:11:51,709 --> 00:11:54,377
Fine.

315
00:11:54,446 --> 00:11:57,113
When I got accepted
to grad school at Caltech,

316
00:11:57,182 --> 00:11:59,449
I was afraid to move
so far away from home.

317
00:11:59,517 --> 00:12:01,651
So Tam said
he'd move out here with me

318
00:12:01,719 --> 00:12:03,419
and be my roommate.
Then,

319
00:12:03,488 --> 00:12:05,288
over the summer,
he got a girlfriend,

320
00:12:05,356 --> 00:12:06,889
even after reading
all the pamphlets

321
00:12:06,958 --> 00:12:09,959
I gave him
about social diseases.

322
00:12:10,028 --> 00:12:13,095
Aw, I remember when you
gave me those pamphlets.

323
00:12:13,164 --> 00:12:15,598
Anyway, Tam stayed
with her in Texas,

324
00:12:15,667 --> 00:12:18,334
and I had to move out here
all by myself.

325
00:12:18,403 --> 00:12:20,970
That must've been scary.

326
00:12:21,039 --> 00:12:22,738
It was.

327
00:12:22,807 --> 00:12:24,474
I was lonely, and I thought

328
00:12:24,542 --> 00:12:26,175
I'd never make a friend again.

329
00:12:26,244 --> 00:12:28,845
And for a long time, I didn't.

330
00:12:28,913 --> 00:12:29,913
But then you did.

331
00:12:29,981 --> 00:12:31,781
And great friends.

332
00:12:31,850 --> 00:12:35,051
If you think about it, if Tam
had moved out here with you,

333
00:12:35,119 --> 00:12:37,520
who knows what your life
would've been like.

334
00:12:44,062 --> 00:12:45,628
Yes.

335
00:12:45,697 --> 00:12:47,174
Uh, I'm Leonard Hofstadter.
I called you

336
00:12:47,198 --> 00:12:48,438
about the apartment.
You said...

337
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:50,600
Tell him to go away.
You already have a roommate.

338
00:12:53,605 --> 00:12:54,605
New neighbor?

339
00:12:55,507 --> 00:12:56,507
Oh, hi.

340
00:12:56,574 --> 00:12:57,607
- Hi.
- Hi.

341
00:12:57,675 --> 00:13:00,109
- Hi.
- Hi.

342
00:13:10,355 --> 00:13:11,287
Tam, look.

343
00:13:11,356 --> 00:13:13,956
Sheldon's hugging me.

344
00:13:14,025 --> 00:13:16,626
It's a Saturnalia miracle.

345
00:13:18,129 --> 00:13:19,862
Sheldon, come here.

346
00:13:19,931 --> 00:13:21,764
Bazinga.

347
00:13:23,268 --> 00:13:26,135
No, my life
would've still been great.

348
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:31,641
So what is the craziest
request anyone's ever made?

349
00:13:31,709 --> 00:13:34,343
Oh, you know,
I can't really say.

350
00:13:34,412 --> 00:13:36,379
Concierge-guest confidentiality.

351
00:13:36,447 --> 00:13:37,747
Really, that's a thing?

352
00:13:37,815 --> 00:13:39,515
No.

353
00:13:39,584 --> 00:13:43,152
This one time, I had to go
to Walmart at 3:00 a.m.

354
00:13:43,221 --> 00:13:45,988
because Britney Spears
needed to blow bubbles.

355
00:13:46,057 --> 00:13:49,058
- Oh.
- That is so cool.

356
00:13:49,127 --> 00:13:51,394
By the way, do not tell Raj
that you met Britney Spears,

357
00:13:51,462 --> 00:13:52,895
because he will literally die.

358
00:13:54,699 --> 00:13:57,166
We've been talking so much
about me,

359
00:13:57,235 --> 00:13:59,368
tell me about Raj.

360
00:13:59,437 --> 00:14:00,614
Okay, are you trying
to get us drunk

361
00:14:00,638 --> 00:14:02,171
so we'll dish on
our friend?

362
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:04,607
'Cause it's totally gonna work,
what do you want to know?

363
00:14:06,077 --> 00:14:07,276
What kind of guy is he?

364
00:14:07,345 --> 00:14:08,678
He is great.

365
00:14:08,746 --> 00:14:09,845
- So great.
- Mm-hmm.

366
00:14:09,914 --> 00:14:11,547
How come he's still single?

367
00:14:13,318 --> 00:14:15,785
- He's great.
- So great. Yeah.

368
00:14:15,853 --> 00:14:17,019
Come on.

369
00:14:17,088 --> 00:14:18,288
There's really nothing
to tell.

370
00:14:18,323 --> 00:14:19,723
Raj is so much fun
to hang out with.

371
00:14:19,791 --> 00:14:21,157
He's like one
of our girlfriends.

372
00:14:21,225 --> 00:14:22,758
And I mean that in a good way.

373
00:14:22,827 --> 00:14:24,794
But also a bad way.

374
00:14:24,862 --> 00:14:26,329
Anything else?

375
00:14:27,465 --> 00:14:29,632
- No.
- No.

376
00:14:29,701 --> 00:14:31,867
I mean, h-he
takes baths with his dog,

377
00:14:31,936 --> 00:14:34,236
but not in a weird way.

378
00:14:34,305 --> 00:14:36,939
Or a normal way;
they both wear swimsuits.

379
00:14:38,209 --> 00:14:41,410
He also cries every time
Hugh Jackman sings.

380
00:14:41,479 --> 00:14:44,880
But not cute sniffles--
full-on snot sobs.

381
00:14:46,184 --> 00:14:47,516
But he is great.

382
00:14:47,585 --> 00:14:49,118
- So great.
- Yeah.

383
00:14:53,391 --> 00:14:54,391
Hello, Sheldon.

384
00:14:54,425 --> 00:14:56,292
Hello Tam.
Thank you for coming.

385
00:14:56,361 --> 00:14:59,895
I just want you to know
that, um...

386
00:14:59,964 --> 00:15:02,064
I forgive you.

387
00:15:02,133 --> 00:15:03,133
I didn't do anything.

388
00:15:03,201 --> 00:15:04,300
And yet, here I am,

389
00:15:04,369 --> 00:15:06,769
still being the bigger man.

390
00:15:06,838 --> 00:15:09,171
Look, I was in love with Beth,

391
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:10,573
and she made me happy.

392
00:15:10,642 --> 00:15:11,907
Y... Really?

393
00:15:11,976 --> 00:15:13,643
Did <i>she</i> let you play
with her train set?

394
00:15:15,446 --> 00:15:17,647
In a manner of speaking.

395
00:15:20,084 --> 00:15:22,985
Sheldon, I needed
to stay in Texas.

396
00:15:23,054 --> 00:15:24,587
And you needed
to come here.

397
00:15:24,656 --> 00:15:26,555
I knew you were gonna
do amazing things,

398
00:15:26,624 --> 00:15:29,025
and meet amazing people
who were gonna respect you,

399
00:15:29,093 --> 00:15:31,293
because you're brilliant.
And because they never had to

400
00:15:31,362 --> 00:15:33,996
fish you out of a dumpster.

401
00:15:34,065 --> 00:15:35,242
Well, they have,
but it was during

402
00:15:35,266 --> 00:15:37,800
my short-lived parkour phase.

403
00:15:37,869 --> 00:15:40,770
I didn't mean to upset you.

404
00:15:40,838 --> 00:15:42,405
And I want you to know
I'm really proud

405
00:15:42,473 --> 00:15:44,073
of everything you've done.

406
00:15:44,142 --> 00:15:45,875
Thank you.

407
00:15:45,943 --> 00:15:48,210
It did work out for me.

408
00:15:48,279 --> 00:15:51,947
And I'm sorry that things
didn't work out for you.

409
00:15:52,016 --> 00:15:53,716
They did work out for me.

410
00:15:53,785 --> 00:15:57,019
Oh, Tam, you don't need
to be brave on my account.

411
00:15:57,088 --> 00:15:58,354
I'm not.

412
00:15:58,423 --> 00:16:01,123
I have a great wife
and amazing children.

413
00:16:01,192 --> 00:16:02,391
I'm very happy.

414
00:16:02,460 --> 00:16:04,293
Brave, brave Tam.

415
00:16:07,932 --> 00:16:09,999
Sounds like Penny and
Bernadette had fun last night.

416
00:16:10,068 --> 00:16:11,167
I know.

417
00:16:11,235 --> 00:16:12,668
Bernie came home pretty drunk.

418
00:16:12,737 --> 00:16:15,037
She tried to sleep in the dryer.

419
00:16:17,208 --> 00:16:20,810
Hello, you all remember Tam,
my best friend from high school.

420
00:16:20,878 --> 00:16:22,256
- Yeah. - Of course.
- How's it going?

421
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:24,747
Sheldon's been showing
me and my son around.

422
00:16:24,816 --> 00:16:26,322
Now we know where all
the clean bathrooms are.

423
00:16:26,346 --> 00:16:28,218
Yep.

424
00:16:28,219 --> 00:16:29,459
You just remember the mnemonic:

425
00:16:29,487 --> 00:16:31,087
if it's number one,
the library's fun,

426
00:16:31,155 --> 00:16:33,155
if it's number two,
the basement's for you.

427
00:16:34,826 --> 00:16:35,925
I'm glad you guys made up.

428
00:16:35,993 --> 00:16:38,327
Well, I realized my life
turned out great,

429
00:16:38,396 --> 00:16:40,162
and it's silly
to hold a grudge.

430
00:16:40,231 --> 00:16:42,298
And I had no idea we were
fighting, so it was easy.

431
00:16:43,501 --> 00:16:44,834
Uh, don't worry, Leonard,

432
00:16:44,902 --> 00:16:47,169
you're still
my California best friend.

433
00:16:49,173 --> 00:16:50,673
Cool.

434
00:16:50,742 --> 00:16:53,075
So, what do you want to do now?

435
00:16:53,144 --> 00:16:55,811
Go to the train store,
go to the comic book store?

436
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:57,958
Actually, I have to grab my
son and head to the airport.

437
00:16:57,982 --> 00:16:59,582
I was just about
to call a cab.

438
00:16:59,650 --> 00:17:01,684
Don't be silly,
you don't have to call a cab.

439
00:17:01,753 --> 00:17:03,018
You're my oldest friend.

440
00:17:03,087 --> 00:17:06,021
Leonard will take you.
Right, Leonard?

441
00:17:06,090 --> 00:17:08,524
Sure.

442
00:17:08,593 --> 00:17:09,725
Shall we?

443
00:17:09,794 --> 00:17:10,794
Eh, eh, eh, hold on.

444
00:17:10,828 --> 00:17:12,328
I haven't seen
Tam in 20 years,

445
00:17:12,396 --> 00:17:13,640
give me a chance
to say good-bye.

446
00:17:13,664 --> 00:17:15,498
Bye.

447
00:17:22,381 --> 00:17:24,214
Check it out--
LeBron James posted a picture

448
00:17:24,283 --> 00:17:25,482
of me and him
on Instagram.

449
00:17:25,551 --> 00:17:26,783
I don't see you.

450
00:17:26,852 --> 00:17:28,051
Look right behind him.

451
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:29,319
No.

452
00:17:29,388 --> 00:17:31,855
Okay. You see that table
just past his left shoulder?

453
00:17:31,924 --> 00:17:34,992
Now go back two more tables
and over to the right.

454
00:17:35,060 --> 00:17:37,494
All I see is
a yellow smudge.

455
00:17:37,563 --> 00:17:39,529
That's me!

456
00:17:41,567 --> 00:17:42,833
Oh, it's Raj.

457
00:17:42,902 --> 00:17:44,968
Hey Raj,
I'm here with Penny.

458
00:17:45,037 --> 00:17:47,938
What the hell did you two
say to Anu?

459
00:17:48,007 --> 00:17:49,306
Uh...

460
00:17:49,375 --> 00:17:51,608
whatever do you mean?

461
00:17:51,677 --> 00:17:53,977
Why, why would you tell her

462
00:17:54,046 --> 00:17:56,113
I wear ladies' deodorant?

463
00:17:56,181 --> 00:18:00,050
Uh, because you're a boy
and it's really funny.

464
00:18:00,119 --> 00:18:02,386
Oh, oh, okay. Pardon me

465
00:18:02,454 --> 00:18:05,122
for having the confidence
to smell daisy-fresh.

466
00:18:06,358 --> 00:18:08,725
Just do me a favor
and stay away from her.

467
00:18:10,429 --> 00:18:13,096
Ugh, God, now I feel bad.

468
00:18:13,165 --> 00:18:14,364
I know.

469
00:18:14,433 --> 00:18:15,799
Maybe we should
take her out again

470
00:18:15,868 --> 00:18:17,067
and do some damage control.

471
00:18:17,136 --> 00:18:19,102
You know, that's a good idea.

472
00:18:19,171 --> 00:18:21,171
Think she can
get us into SoHo House?

473
00:18:22,841 --> 00:18:24,709
I don't know, but we
owe it to Raj to try.

474
00:18:24,733 --> 00:18:25,733
Mm-hmm.
