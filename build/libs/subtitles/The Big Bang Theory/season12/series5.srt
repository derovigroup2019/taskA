1
00:00:01,759 --> 00:00:03,793
Recently, 12 new moons

2
00:00:03,862 --> 00:00:05,911
were discovered
orbiting Jupiter,

3
00:00:05,912 --> 00:00:08,712
bringing the total up to 79.

4
00:00:08,781 --> 00:00:11,215
As a middle child myself,
I'd like to extend

5
00:00:11,284 --> 00:00:14,551
my sympathies to moons
two through 78.

6
00:00:16,422 --> 00:00:18,555
Your grandpa
will never learn your name.

7
00:00:20,493 --> 00:00:23,460
I'd like to thank you for
joining me on this journey

8
00:00:23,529 --> 00:00:25,663
through the stars.

9
00:00:25,731 --> 00:00:26,997
If you enjoyed
this lecture,

10
00:00:27,066 --> 00:00:32,236
please come back Thursday
for the exact same one.

11
00:00:36,409 --> 00:00:38,049
Do I look like I just woke up?

12
00:00:38,050 --> 00:00:38,565
No.

13
00:00:38,589 --> 00:00:40,370
Great. I'm gonna
go say hey to Raj.

14
00:00:42,448 --> 00:00:43,759
What were you guys
giggling about?

15
00:00:43,783 --> 00:00:45,416
They were passing
notes to each other.

16
00:00:45,484 --> 00:00:47,718
Oh-ho, love notes?

17
00:00:47,787 --> 00:00:49,086
If you love math.

18
00:00:50,189 --> 00:00:52,256
And we do.

19
00:00:52,325 --> 00:00:54,058
It's for our
super-asymmetry theory.

20
00:00:54,126 --> 00:00:55,570
Yeah, Amy and I have
been having so much fun

21
00:00:55,594 --> 00:00:57,194
collaborating together.

22
00:00:57,263 --> 00:00:58,807
Well, you know what they
say, you never collaborate

23
00:00:58,831 --> 00:01:01,865
as much as your first
year of marriage.

24
00:01:01,934 --> 00:01:03,982
- Hey, great show.
- Thanks.

25
00:01:03,983 --> 00:01:05,121
Oh, Howard, uh,
this is Andrea.

26
00:01:05,122 --> 00:01:06,384
She's the director
of the planetarium.

27
00:01:06,408 --> 00:01:07,586
Hi.

28
00:01:07,587 --> 00:01:09,186
Nice to meet you.
I'm Howard Wolowitz.

29
00:01:09,255 --> 00:01:10,888
Engineer, husband, father...

30
00:01:10,957 --> 00:01:12,423
...astronaut.

31
00:01:13,426 --> 00:01:14,625
Really? You're an astronaut?

32
00:01:14,694 --> 00:01:16,393
Well, I don't like to brag.

33
00:01:16,462 --> 00:01:17,962
Hmm, yeah, but
somehow, you manage.

34
00:01:19,832 --> 00:01:21,977
Raj, you should have Howard
join you for one of your shows.

35
00:01:22,001 --> 00:01:23,767
Oh, that might be fun.

36
00:01:23,836 --> 00:01:25,681
But-- it might be, but with
two small children at home

37
00:01:25,705 --> 00:01:28,005
and a full-time job,
I'm sure you're too busy.

38
00:01:28,074 --> 00:01:29,506
No, I could find the time.

39
00:01:29,575 --> 00:01:30,364
Well, you don't have
to decide right now.

40
00:01:30,388 --> 00:01:31,209
It's okay, I...

41
00:01:31,210 --> 00:01:32,843
He can't do it.

42
00:01:32,912 --> 00:01:34,845
Hey, hurry up, guys.

43
00:01:34,914 --> 00:01:36,191
The gift shop's closing,
and Amy said

44
00:01:36,215 --> 00:01:37,117
I can get one big thing
or two little things.

45
00:01:37,118 --> 00:01:40,618

48
00:01:47,026 --> 00:01:48,626
? The Earth began to cool ?

49
00:01:48,694 --> 00:01:51,328
? The autotrophs began to drool,
Neanderthals developed tools ?

? We built the Wall ?

? Math, Science, History,
unraveling the mystery ?

52
00:01:56,602 --> 00:01:58,435
? That all started
with a big bang ?

00:01:58,504 --> 00:02:00,070

55
00:02:06,095 --> 00:02:08,235
So I'm gonna place the sensory
isolation helmet on you

56
00:02:08,236 --> 00:02:09,535
for about five minutes.

57
00:02:09,604 --> 00:02:10,769
All you need to do

58
00:02:10,838 --> 00:02:12,438
is sit still and relax.

59
00:02:12,506 --> 00:02:14,607
What do I do if I start
to get claustrophobic?

60
00:02:14,675 --> 00:02:17,145
Oh, the helmet will sense that
and stop the experiment.

61
00:02:17,146 --> 00:02:17,658
Really?

62
00:02:17,682 --> 00:02:19,682
No, but that would
be cool, wouldn't it?

63
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:24,483
Amy, are you busy?

64
00:02:24,552 --> 00:02:27,086
I've got a subject wired up
for a sensory study.

65
00:02:27,154 --> 00:02:29,054
So...

66
00:02:29,123 --> 00:02:31,257
Yes, I'm busy.

67
00:02:31,325 --> 00:02:32,625
Oh.

68
00:02:32,693 --> 00:02:33,971
I'm tracking a subject's
brain activity

69
00:02:33,995 --> 00:02:36,462
in real time as we
introduce olfactory stimuli.

70
00:02:36,530 --> 00:02:38,597
I'm smelling baby powder.

71
00:02:38,666 --> 00:02:42,067
That's just my husband.

72
00:02:42,136 --> 00:02:44,970
Well, I had a thought about
our super-asymmetry theory.

73
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:46,472
Let me show you this one thing.

74
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:47,840
Well, I-I want to see it,

75
00:02:47,908 --> 00:02:49,419
but not when I'm in the middle
of an experiment.

76
00:02:49,443 --> 00:02:52,344
Still baby powder!

77
00:02:52,413 --> 00:02:55,581
Boy, he is annoying. Do any
of those buttons shock him?

78
00:02:55,650 --> 00:02:59,585
Look, I'm really excited
about our paper, too,

79
00:02:59,654 --> 00:03:01,020
but I've got
a lot of my own work

80
00:03:01,088 --> 00:03:02,399
to catch up on,
so let's talk later.

81
00:03:02,423 --> 00:03:05,324
Okay, I'll just say one
more thing: lambda calculus.

82
00:03:05,393 --> 00:03:07,693
And if that wets your whistle,
you know where to find me.

83
00:03:07,762 --> 00:03:09,895
Boop.

84
00:03:14,068 --> 00:03:16,935
You okay? You seem distracted.

85
00:03:17,004 --> 00:03:19,938
I'm-I'm just thinking about Raj.

86
00:03:20,007 --> 00:03:21,767
I'm thinking about
Chris Hemsworth. Let's go.

87
00:03:24,445 --> 00:03:27,212
He sort of hurt my feelings.

88
00:03:27,281 --> 00:03:30,883
Biceps, hammer, abs.
Still in it.

89
00:03:30,951 --> 00:03:34,520
Why wouldn't he want me to be
in his planetarium show?

90
00:03:34,588 --> 00:03:36,855
And it's gone.

91
00:03:36,924 --> 00:03:39,191
Sorry, it's just the director
of the planetarium thought

92
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:41,527
it'd be fun for me to join Raj
for one of his shows,

93
00:03:41,595 --> 00:03:44,229
and he made it clear
that he didn't want me to.

94
00:03:44,298 --> 00:03:45,898
Of course he wouldn't
want you to.

95
00:03:45,966 --> 00:03:47,344
I mean, think about it.
If you were him,

96
00:03:47,368 --> 00:03:51,437
would you want to share the
stage with a sexy-ass astronaut?

97
00:03:51,505 --> 00:03:53,806
I don't know.
How sexy are we talking?

98
00:03:53,874 --> 00:03:58,744
Oh, you know, tight pants,
huge biceps, magic hammer.

99
00:03:58,813 --> 00:04:01,780
- Wait, w-who are we talk...
- Shh, I'm back in it.

100
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:04,828
The fundamental problem

101
00:04:04,852 --> 00:04:06,919
with elementary quantum
mechanical formalism

102
00:04:06,987 --> 00:04:08,587
is that the Fourier transform

103
00:04:08,656 --> 00:04:11,056
extends to minus infinity
in time.

104
00:04:11,125 --> 00:04:13,959
Hey, don't dumb this down
for me.

105
00:04:15,629 --> 00:04:17,296
Penny, I'm...

106
00:04:17,365 --> 00:04:18,442
Late for that thing. See you.

107
00:04:18,466 --> 00:04:19,264
Leonard!

108
00:04:19,333 --> 00:04:21,500
Oh, Sheldon.

109
00:04:21,569 --> 00:04:22,849
Didn't see you there. What's up?

110
00:04:22,903 --> 00:04:25,003
Well, uh, he was
excited to talk science

111
00:04:25,072 --> 00:04:26,572
with Amy,
but she was working late,

112
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:28,874
so he decided to come over
and share it with me.

113
00:04:28,943 --> 00:04:32,010
With me, Leonard.

114
00:04:32,079 --> 00:04:34,012
With me.

115
00:04:34,081 --> 00:04:36,849
Sheldon,
we've talked about this.

116
00:04:36,917 --> 00:04:39,651
You can't go around
boring other people's wives.

117
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:40,753
Yeah.

118
00:04:40,821 --> 00:04:43,522
I already got a man for that.

119
00:04:43,591 --> 00:04:46,291
- Yeah, you do.
- Yeah.

120
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:47,471
It's just, I've
just been enjoying

121
00:04:47,495 --> 00:04:48,861
my collaboration with Amy,

122
00:04:48,929 --> 00:04:50,440
but ever since we got back
from our honeymoon,

123
00:04:50,464 --> 00:04:51,930
she has so little time.

124
00:04:51,999 --> 00:04:53,399
Well, she does have her own job.

125
00:04:53,467 --> 00:04:55,100
Yeah, but it's so dull.

126
00:04:55,169 --> 00:04:57,236
Trying to understand
how the brain

127
00:04:57,304 --> 00:05:01,407
translates the five senses
into biochemical information.

128
00:05:01,475 --> 00:05:04,143
I'd rather wait in line
without my phone.

129
00:05:04,211 --> 00:05:07,479
Okay, well, Leonard's here now.
You can talk science with him.

130
00:05:07,548 --> 00:05:08,814
Where you going?

131
00:05:08,883 --> 00:05:10,315
Oh, that thing
you were late for.

132
00:05:10,384 --> 00:05:13,218
One of us should
really be there.

133
00:05:14,655 --> 00:05:17,122
Hey. Got a sec?

134
00:05:17,191 --> 00:05:18,123
Sure. What's up?

135
00:05:18,192 --> 00:05:20,325
I just want to let
you know I get

136
00:05:20,394 --> 00:05:23,061
why you don't want me to be
a part of the planetarium show.

137
00:05:23,130 --> 00:05:26,432
Oh, great.
Thanks for stopping by.

138
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:28,167
You don't want to talk
about the stars

139
00:05:28,235 --> 00:05:30,169
next to an actual astronaut.

140
00:05:30,237 --> 00:05:33,071
That would be like doing karaoke
with a rock star.

141
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:37,910
First of all, I've totally done
karaoke with a rock star.

142
00:05:37,978 --> 00:05:39,678
Or are you forgetting
when the Spin Doctors

143
00:05:39,747 --> 00:05:42,514
handed me the mic
at the Orange County Fair?

144
00:05:42,583 --> 00:05:45,617
Listen, I understand
you being intimidated,

145
00:05:45,686 --> 00:05:48,320
but I can't help that I'm proud
of being an astronaut.

146
00:05:48,389 --> 00:05:49,655
It's a big deal.

147
00:05:49,723 --> 00:05:51,824
Oh, it certainly is,
but I also happen to be

148
00:05:51,892 --> 00:05:54,259
very accomplished in my field.

149
00:05:54,328 --> 00:05:55,761
Great. So you have no reason

150
00:05:55,830 --> 00:05:58,096
to be scared
of sharing the spotlight.

151
00:05:58,165 --> 00:06:01,700
Please. I may be scared
of heights and spiders

152
00:06:01,769 --> 00:06:03,335
and showing up
at a costume party

153
00:06:03,404 --> 00:06:05,003
that turns out
to be a regular party,

154
00:06:05,072 --> 00:06:09,174
but I am not scared of sharing
the spotlight with you!

155
00:06:16,150 --> 00:06:17,716
What's happening?

156
00:06:17,785 --> 00:06:19,718
I just stormed out
for dramatic effect.

157
00:06:19,787 --> 00:06:22,821
I... Actually, I-I don't have
anywhere to go.

158
00:06:25,359 --> 00:06:28,293
President Siebert, how much
do you know about physics?

159
00:06:28,362 --> 00:06:29,895
I'm a physicist.

160
00:06:31,999 --> 00:06:34,399
Huh. I would not
have guessed that.

161
00:06:35,736 --> 00:06:37,380
I have a doctorate
from Indiana University.

162
00:06:37,404 --> 00:06:38,504
Oh, that makes more sense.

163
00:06:38,572 --> 00:06:40,305
Well, don't worry, I'll go slow.

164
00:06:40,374 --> 00:06:42,508
Thank you.

165
00:06:42,576 --> 00:06:45,611
Dr. Fowler and I have
been working on

166
00:06:45,679 --> 00:06:47,613
a theory of super-asymmetry

167
00:06:47,681 --> 00:06:50,716
that could reconcile the lack
of observation of supersymmetry

168
00:06:50,784 --> 00:06:52,362
in a world still governed
by string theory.

169
00:06:52,386 --> 00:06:56,788
Interesting. So you're taking
the paradigms of supersymmetry,

170
00:06:56,857 --> 00:07:00,726
but removing the limitations
of obeying the Poincar? algebra.

171
00:07:00,794 --> 00:07:02,961
Well, aren't you just
the pride of Bloomington?

172
00:07:03,030 --> 00:07:05,364
What do you want, Sheldon?

173
00:07:05,432 --> 00:07:07,132
Dr. Fowler has
found herself distracted

174
00:07:07,201 --> 00:07:09,134
by the commitments
in her own lab.

175
00:07:09,203 --> 00:07:10,769
It would be a great help
to both of us

176
00:07:10,838 --> 00:07:12,837
if you could free her up
from her other projects.

177
00:07:12,838 --> 00:07:13,683
I'm confused.

178
00:07:13,707 --> 00:07:15,649
Yeah, well, there's
that Indiana.

179
00:07:16,410 --> 00:07:19,478
This is physics research.
Dr. Fowler's a neuroscientist.

180
00:07:19,547 --> 00:07:20,812
Y-Yes,

181
00:07:20,881 --> 00:07:22,381
but her insights
into the very ways

182
00:07:22,449 --> 00:07:25,651
we conceptualize symmetry and
asymmetry have been invaluable.

183
00:07:25,719 --> 00:07:27,085
- Dr. Cooper...
- L-Look, I know

184
00:07:27,154 --> 00:07:28,598
what you're thinking,
that "they're newlyweds,

185
00:07:28,622 --> 00:07:30,600
how are they gonna keep
their hands off of each other?"

186
00:07:30,624 --> 00:07:34,059
Let me assure you, we will not
engage in workplace coitus.

187
00:07:35,329 --> 00:07:36,840
Okay, if I won't
put a bagel on my desk,

188
00:07:36,864 --> 00:07:39,932
I'm certainly not putting
Amy's bare bottom.

189
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,369
I-I must say,
I do not enjoy our talks.

190
00:07:49,009 --> 00:07:51,476
Dr. Park, may I help you?

191
00:07:51,545 --> 00:07:53,690
Actually, yes, do you have any
better notes on this project?

192
00:07:53,714 --> 00:07:55,747
I'm having a hard time
reading your handwriting.

193
00:07:55,816 --> 00:07:57,449
Oh, uh, allow me
to rephrase that.

194
00:07:57,518 --> 00:07:59,785
What the hell
are you doing in my lab?

195
00:07:59,853 --> 00:08:03,288
I'm sorry, I was reassigned
to this project.

196
00:08:03,357 --> 00:08:04,367
I was told you were taking

197
00:08:04,391 --> 00:08:05,324
a temporary sabbatical

198
00:08:05,392 --> 00:08:06,392
to focus on other work.

199
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:08,327
N-No, that-that's crazy.

200
00:08:08,395 --> 00:08:09,761
This is my research.

201
00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:12,965
- Oh, Amy, there you are.
- No, not...

202
00:08:13,033 --> 00:08:16,034
Not now, Sheldon, I'm dealing
with an epic screwup,

203
00:08:16,103 --> 00:08:17,180
and when I find out
who's responsible,

204
00:08:17,204 --> 00:08:18,403
they're gonna get an earful.

205
00:08:18,472 --> 00:08:19,749
All right, well,
when you're done, let me know,

206
00:08:19,773 --> 00:08:21,073
I've got some exciting news.

207
00:08:21,141 --> 00:08:22,981
I'm sorry, I'm confused.
President Siebert said

208
00:08:23,010 --> 00:08:24,977
you were focusing on
some important physics work

209
00:08:25,045 --> 00:08:27,145
and I should take over
your lab in the interim.

210
00:08:27,214 --> 00:08:29,214
Uh, hey, that was
my exciting news.

211
00:08:30,751 --> 00:08:31,761
All right, I'm gonna
tell you again.

212
00:08:31,785 --> 00:08:32,945
Pretend you haven't heard it.

213
00:08:37,392 --> 00:08:39,718
You got me removed
from my own project?

214
00:08:39,719 --> 00:08:40,885
Yeah, and it wasn't easy.

215
00:08:40,954 --> 00:08:42,954
Apparently, you're very
difficult to replace.

216
00:08:43,023 --> 00:08:45,123
Hey, just between you and me,

217
00:08:45,192 --> 00:08:48,460
they consider Dr. Park
quite the step down.

218
00:08:51,565 --> 00:08:55,033
I was trying to pick my moment
to leave. This seems like it.

219
00:08:55,101 --> 00:08:58,203
Wow. Banker's hours.

220
00:08:58,271 --> 00:09:01,105
No wonder you're not
on the tenure track.

221
00:09:01,174 --> 00:09:03,541
Sheldon, you had no right.

222
00:09:03,610 --> 00:09:05,388
What-- I thought you said
you were spread too thin.

223
00:09:05,412 --> 00:09:06,722
You said that you wished
you had more time to focus

224
00:09:06,746 --> 00:09:08,980
on our research.
I thought I was helping.

225
00:09:09,049 --> 00:09:10,081
Well, you're not.

226
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:12,550
I mean, I have years
invested in this work,

227
00:09:12,619 --> 00:09:15,053
and now someone's gonna
come in and take it over?

228
00:09:15,121 --> 00:09:17,201
I mean, how would you feel
if I let Leonard take over

229
00:09:17,257 --> 00:09:18,790
your super-asymmetry project?

230
00:09:18,859 --> 00:09:20,225
That's funny.

231
00:09:21,661 --> 00:09:25,029
Oh, he'd be like a puppy
with a microscope.

232
00:09:27,868 --> 00:09:32,537
If I had a nickel for every time
a charity sent me a nickel.

233
00:09:34,808 --> 00:09:37,575
Really? That's gonna be
our whole life, huh?

234
00:09:39,312 --> 00:09:41,012
If my father's any guide,
around 50,

235
00:09:41,081 --> 00:09:43,882
I start to lose my hearing
and get two new jokes.

236
00:09:44,951 --> 00:09:47,418
- Hey.
- Hey.

237
00:09:47,487 --> 00:09:48,920
I brought Chinese.

238
00:09:48,989 --> 00:09:51,189
Oh, that's a nice surprise.
What's the occasion?

239
00:09:51,258 --> 00:09:54,125
Please, I don't need a reason
to bring food to my friends.

240
00:09:54,194 --> 00:09:55,727
But you have one, don't you?

241
00:09:55,795 --> 00:09:57,362
Yeah, I need your help.

242
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:59,697
All right, lay it on us.

243
00:09:59,766 --> 00:10:02,033
So, I folded,

244
00:10:02,102 --> 00:10:03,479
and I told Howard
he could be a part

245
00:10:03,503 --> 00:10:05,169
of my planetarium show.

246
00:10:05,238 --> 00:10:06,415
And now I'm worried
he's just gonna

247
00:10:06,439 --> 00:10:08,306
make the whole thing
about himself.

248
00:10:08,375 --> 00:10:09,719
So just tell him
you changed your mind

249
00:10:09,743 --> 00:10:11,042
and you don't
want him to do it.

250
00:10:11,111 --> 00:10:12,588
No, no, then he's gonna think
I'm too insecure

251
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:13,756
to share the spotlight with him.

252
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:15,246
And he'd be right.

253
00:10:15,315 --> 00:10:17,382
I came here
for your support.

254
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:18,783
Well, then, you just walked up

255
00:10:18,852 --> 00:10:20,285
three flights of stairs
for nothing.

256
00:10:20,353 --> 00:10:22,754
Wait, don't you mean
four flights?

257
00:10:22,822 --> 00:10:24,088
No, it's actually three.

258
00:10:24,157 --> 00:10:26,190
But we're on the fourth floor.

259
00:10:26,259 --> 00:10:27,570
I mean, you have the lobby,
first floor,

260
00:10:27,594 --> 00:10:28,594
second, third, fourth.

261
00:10:28,662 --> 00:10:30,128
The lobby's the first floor,

262
00:10:30,196 --> 00:10:31,476
so lobby, second, third, fourth.

263
00:10:31,531 --> 00:10:33,231
That does not seem right.

264
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:35,500
Hello...

265
00:10:35,569 --> 00:10:38,703
Sorry, Raj, who cares if
Howard tries to steal the show?

266
00:10:38,772 --> 00:10:40,182
All right? You're great
at what you do.

267
00:10:40,206 --> 00:10:41,739
Just be the bigger man.

268
00:10:41,808 --> 00:10:43,252
And if it makes you feel better,
Penny and I will come

269
00:10:43,276 --> 00:10:45,221
so you'll have a couple of
friendly faces in the audience.

270
00:10:45,245 --> 00:10:46,644
Thank you.
That would be nice.

271
00:10:46,713 --> 00:10:48,479
Can you just...
Sorry, give me a minute?

272
00:10:56,523 --> 00:10:58,990
Hey, Raj, if I had a nickel
for every time

273
00:10:59,059 --> 00:11:01,259
a charity sent me a nickel...

274
00:11:02,829 --> 00:11:04,462
That's hilarious!

275
00:11:04,531 --> 00:11:05,697
I know.

276
00:11:11,404 --> 00:11:12,670
It's three, right?

277
00:11:12,739 --> 00:11:15,506
Just shut up.

278
00:11:16,943 --> 00:11:18,676
Oh, good,
we caught you.

279
00:11:18,745 --> 00:11:21,179
Yes, good.

280
00:11:21,247 --> 00:11:23,548
You had no right
to reassign my project.

281
00:11:23,617 --> 00:11:24,782
Yeah, no right at all.

282
00:11:24,851 --> 00:11:26,351
Dr. Fowler,
I don't understand.

283
00:11:26,419 --> 00:11:28,353
Dr. Cooper assured me
this is what you wanted.

284
00:11:28,421 --> 00:11:30,221
Oh-oh! Can you
believe this guy?

285
00:11:30,290 --> 00:11:31,556
Oh, sure,

286
00:11:31,625 --> 00:11:34,092
so a couple of men get together
behind closed doors

287
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:35,760
to decide the fate
of a woman's career.

288
00:11:35,829 --> 00:11:37,128
I thought we'd
moved past this.

289
00:11:37,197 --> 00:11:39,864
Sheldon, this is
your fault.

290
00:11:39,933 --> 00:11:41,232
Ooh, sounds like
the old lady's

291
00:11:41,301 --> 00:11:42,700
putting me in the
doghouse tonight.

292
00:11:42,769 --> 00:11:44,602
Dr. Fowler,

293
00:11:44,671 --> 00:11:46,215
you are very important
to this university

294
00:11:46,239 --> 00:11:48,272
and I would like
to sincerely apologize.

295
00:11:48,341 --> 00:11:50,408
So I can have
my project back?

296
00:11:50,477 --> 00:11:52,121
- I'm afraid it's not that simple.
- Why not?

297
00:11:52,145 --> 00:11:53,945
Well, in order
to free up personnel...

298
00:11:54,014 --> 00:11:57,415
Hey, hey, don't go
mansplaining things to her.

299
00:11:57,484 --> 00:11:59,484
I don't think that's
what he was doing.

300
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:00,963
Oh, then perhaps
you don't understand.

301
00:12:00,987 --> 00:12:02,954
See, mansplaining is when
a man explains things

302
00:12:03,023 --> 00:12:04,322
to a woman like
she's stupid.

303
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:08,893
Boop.

304
00:12:10,330 --> 00:12:12,230
So when was the last time

305
00:12:12,298 --> 00:12:14,565
you saw Howard in his
astronaut uniform?

306
00:12:14,634 --> 00:12:16,367
About a week ago.

307
00:12:16,436 --> 00:12:17,769
Really? What was
the occasion?

308
00:12:17,837 --> 00:12:19,404
Date night.

309
00:12:20,707 --> 00:12:22,073
We do a little role-playing.

310
00:12:22,142 --> 00:12:23,875
What role
do you play?

311
00:12:23,943 --> 00:12:27,945
I am Ykatarina Nazdorovya,

312
00:12:28,014 --> 00:12:30,915
lonely Russian cosmonaut
who is expert at physics

313
00:12:30,984 --> 00:12:32,917
and making love.

314
00:12:34,888 --> 00:12:38,790
Okay, that just made
the next hour really weird.

315
00:12:41,094 --> 00:12:43,928
Good evening,
I am Dr. Rajesh Koothrappali,

316
00:12:43,997 --> 00:12:46,864
and usually I take you on a trip
through the stars,

317
00:12:46,933 --> 00:12:49,033
but tonight,
we'll begin our journey

318
00:12:49,102 --> 00:12:52,170
much closer to home, 220 miles

319
00:12:52,238 --> 00:12:54,972
straight up to
the International Space Station,

320
00:12:55,041 --> 00:12:58,509
which is manned by a team
of brave men and women.

321
00:12:58,578 --> 00:13:00,845
Flexible men and women.

322
00:13:00,914 --> 00:13:02,680
Switch with me.

323
00:13:02,749 --> 00:13:05,483
And we are fortunate

324
00:13:05,552 --> 00:13:08,820
to have one of those men
here with us tonight.

325
00:13:08,888 --> 00:13:11,522
Please welcome to
the Griffith Observatory

326
00:13:11,591 --> 00:13:13,791
astronaut Howard Joel Wolowitz.

327
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:19,597
<i>Kak horosho.</i>

328
00:13:21,534 --> 00:13:24,469
- What is she ta...
- Don't ask.

329
00:13:24,537 --> 00:13:27,672
Thank you, Raj, that was
a really nice introduction.

330
00:13:27,741 --> 00:13:28,973
Well, it's from my heart.

331
00:13:29,042 --> 00:13:32,877
So, Howard, you are
in an elite group.

332
00:13:32,946 --> 00:13:36,180
Only 232 people
have ever been on

333
00:13:36,249 --> 00:13:38,683
the International Space
Station. How does that

334
00:13:38,752 --> 00:13:40,084
make you feel?

335
00:13:40,153 --> 00:13:42,620
Honestly, lucky.

336
00:13:42,689 --> 00:13:44,689
Most astronauts have to
train their whole lives.

337
00:13:44,758 --> 00:13:47,658
I was just in the right
place at the right time.

338
00:13:47,727 --> 00:13:50,228
Oh, please, luck had
nothing to do with it.

339
00:13:50,296 --> 00:13:52,764
You people need to know
how impressive

340
00:13:52,832 --> 00:13:54,532
this man is.
He was up there

341
00:13:54,601 --> 00:13:57,268
because he's the
only one qualified

342
00:13:57,337 --> 00:13:59,704
to install a piece of
equipment that he designed.

343
00:13:59,773 --> 00:14:01,939
Thanks, but if you want
to talk impressive,

344
00:14:02,008 --> 00:14:04,108
this guy right here
discovered a planetary object

345
00:14:04,177 --> 00:14:05,443
outside the
Kuiper belt.

346
00:14:05,512 --> 00:14:07,011
He worked on
the Mars rover.

347
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:09,180
He helped launch the
New Horizons space probe.

348
00:14:09,249 --> 00:14:12,750
He went to space
on a Russian rocket.

349
00:14:12,819 --> 00:14:15,186
And I was scared
the whole time.

350
00:14:15,255 --> 00:14:19,123
And I was scared for you,
but also proud.

351
00:14:19,192 --> 00:14:22,727
Wow.

352
00:14:22,796 --> 00:14:25,062
I don't think you've ever
said that to me before.

353
00:14:25,131 --> 00:14:26,964
I should have,

354
00:14:27,033 --> 00:14:29,400
and I'm gonna
say it again.

355
00:14:29,469 --> 00:14:30,802
I'm proud of you.

356
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:33,571
You're my best friend,
and I love you.

357
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:37,108
Aw, Raj,
I love you, too.

358
00:14:37,177 --> 00:14:40,545
What is happening?

359
00:14:40,613 --> 00:14:45,049
Bring it in, spaceman,
you've been cleared for landing.

360
00:14:48,454 --> 00:14:51,455
- Can you believe these two...
- - Are you crying?

361
00:15:01,513 --> 00:15:02,871
Hello, Sheldon.

362
00:15:02,872 --> 00:15:04,305
Hello, Arthur.

363
00:15:04,374 --> 00:15:07,542
Now, I'm confused, usually when
you appear to me in my dreams,

364
00:15:07,611 --> 00:15:09,110
we're on the planet Dagobah.

365
00:15:09,179 --> 00:15:11,179
This is Dagobah.

366
00:15:15,352 --> 00:15:17,885
I didn't know that Dagobah
had delicatessens.

367
00:15:17,954 --> 00:15:20,421
Not good ones.

368
00:15:21,458 --> 00:15:23,157
Whatever you do,

369
00:15:23,226 --> 00:15:26,194
don't order the Reuben.

370
00:15:26,262 --> 00:15:29,430
I'm having a problem
in my marriage.

371
00:15:29,499 --> 00:15:32,900
I've upset my wife and I don't
know how to make it right.

372
00:15:32,969 --> 00:15:36,738
And you're... and
you're coming to me for advice?

373
00:15:36,806 --> 00:15:41,242
I-I upset my wife every time
I woke up in the morning.

374
00:15:41,311 --> 00:15:44,078
I'm not coming to you,

375
00:15:44,147 --> 00:15:46,514
you're just a manifestation
of my subconscious.

376
00:15:46,583 --> 00:15:48,249
I mean,
I'm actually coming to me.

377
00:15:48,318 --> 00:15:51,819
So you know everything
I'm going to say.

378
00:15:51,888 --> 00:15:53,454
Yes, but it sounds
wiser from you

379
00:15:53,523 --> 00:15:55,757
because you're old and glowing.

380
00:15:55,825 --> 00:15:56,858
Fine.

381
00:15:56,926 --> 00:15:59,360
Rule number one
in a marriage:

382
00:15:59,429 --> 00:16:01,229
don't go to bed angry.

383
00:16:01,297 --> 00:16:03,765
That makes sense.

384
00:16:03,833 --> 00:16:06,367
Rule number two in a marriage:

385
00:16:06,436 --> 00:16:09,937
if you don't recognize
the shoes under your bed,

386
00:16:10,006 --> 00:16:12,373
they're not your shoes.

387
00:16:12,442 --> 00:16:15,877
Because they're her shoes?

388
00:16:15,945 --> 00:16:17,912
N-Never mind,

389
00:16:17,981 --> 00:16:20,948
just-just go with
rule number one.

390
00:16:21,017 --> 00:16:23,217
Thank you, Arthur.

391
00:16:23,286 --> 00:16:26,054
Uh, before you go,
can I ask you a question?

392
00:16:26,122 --> 00:16:27,188
Of course.

393
00:16:27,257 --> 00:16:30,358
Does this look lean to you?

394
00:16:31,428 --> 00:16:34,262
I ordered lean.

395
00:16:35,432 --> 00:16:37,498
Amy. Wake up. Amy.

396
00:16:37,567 --> 00:16:38,833
What? What's wrong?

397
00:16:38,902 --> 00:16:40,702
We can't go to sleep
angry with each other.

398
00:16:40,770 --> 00:16:41,770
Why not?

399
00:16:41,838 --> 00:16:43,337
It's rule number one.

400
00:16:43,406 --> 00:16:45,773
I'd tell you rule number two,
but it's confusing.

401
00:16:45,842 --> 00:16:47,975
Sheldon,
go to sleep.

402
00:16:48,044 --> 00:16:52,213
Amy. Amy. Amy.

403
00:16:52,282 --> 00:16:54,882
You cut that out!

404
00:16:54,951 --> 00:16:56,784
Oh, good, you're up.

405
00:16:56,853 --> 00:16:59,220
Sheldon...

406
00:16:59,289 --> 00:17:01,689
I just really don't want to talk
to you about this right now.

407
00:17:01,725 --> 00:17:02,657
That's fine.

408
00:17:02,692 --> 00:17:03,891
I just need
you to know

409
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:05,893
that I feel terrible
about what I did

410
00:17:05,962 --> 00:17:07,795
and I wasn't
being malicious.

411
00:17:07,864 --> 00:17:10,031
No, you were being selfish.

412
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:11,365
You're being selfish right now

413
00:17:11,434 --> 00:17:13,468
'cause it's really late
and I just want to sleep.

414
00:17:13,536 --> 00:17:15,803
No, Professor Proton
came to me in my dream

415
00:17:15,872 --> 00:17:17,438
and said we can't
go to sleep angry.

416
00:17:17,507 --> 00:17:19,173
Are you sure
that's what he said?

417
00:17:19,242 --> 00:17:20,408
Close your eyes,
double-check.

418
00:17:20,477 --> 00:17:25,213
Amy, this is
important.

419
00:17:25,281 --> 00:17:29,617
Okay, listen to me.

420
00:17:29,686 --> 00:17:33,287
I love working with you,

421
00:17:33,356 --> 00:17:36,424
but you have to understand
how scary this is for me.

422
00:17:36,493 --> 00:17:38,126
Why?

423
00:17:38,194 --> 00:17:42,830
Because I don't want to get lost
in this relationship.

424
00:17:42,899 --> 00:17:44,999
And when you pulled me
off my project,

425
00:17:45,068 --> 00:17:47,568
it seemed like my biggest
fear was coming true,

426
00:17:47,637 --> 00:17:50,905
the-the things that are mine
are getting subsumed

427
00:17:50,974 --> 00:17:52,940
into the things
that are ours.

428
00:17:53,009 --> 00:17:55,676
I wouldn't want that
to happen, either.

429
00:17:55,745 --> 00:17:58,112
Thank you for explaining

430
00:17:58,181 --> 00:17:59,514
and for using
the word "subsume,"

431
00:17:59,582 --> 00:18:01,048
that's one you
don't hear enough.

432
00:18:01,117 --> 00:18:04,652
You're welcome.

433
00:18:04,721 --> 00:18:06,521
- Good night.
- Good night.

434
00:18:11,294 --> 00:18:12,727
What are you
doing now?

435
00:18:12,796 --> 00:18:14,796
Looking for shoes.

436
00:18:14,864 --> 00:18:16,230
Why?

437
00:18:16,299 --> 00:18:18,900
When your favorite ghost tells
you to do something, you do it.
