00:00:00,068 --> 00:00:01,789
<i>Peviously, on</i>
"The Big Bang Theory"...

2
00:00:01,855 --> 00:00:03,549
We just published
a few months ago.

3
00:00:03,637 --> 00:00:05,939
How did you have time
to design an experiment?

4
00:00:06,027 --> 00:00:09,004
This whole thing is
actually a gigantic accident.

5
00:00:09,091 --> 00:00:11,845
You weren't even thinking
about super-asymmetry?

6
00:00:11,949 --> 00:00:13,627
Thinking about it?
(chuckles)

7
00:00:13,715 --> 00:00:16,230
- We don't even understand it.
- (both laugh)

8
00:00:16,636 --> 00:00:17,916
Uh, can you believe this?

9
00:00:18,004 --> 00:00:19,799
Doctors Pemberton and
Campbell have been doing

10
00:00:19,886 --> 00:00:22,564
a press tour trying to take
credit for super-asymmetry.

11
00:00:22,652 --> 00:00:24,650
So what? I mean, no one's
gonna give them credit

12
00:00:24,738 --> 00:00:26,629
for accidentally
discovering something.

13
00:00:26,717 --> 00:00:27,729
WOLOWITZ:
Yeah, who remembers the guy

14
00:00:27,816 --> 00:00:29,025
who was trying to find India

15
00:00:29,113 --> 00:00:30,564
and discovered America instead?

16
00:00:30,652 --> 00:00:32,302
What was his name again?
(chuckles)

17
00:00:32,707 --> 00:00:34,462
Now stop trying to steal
our Nobel Prize.

18
00:00:34,550 --> 00:00:36,242
You come up
with your own idea.

19
00:00:36,329 --> 00:00:38,129
Yeah, that's not gonna happen.

20
00:00:40,769 --> 00:00:42,729
ELLEN (over TV): <i>Have a seat,
thanks for being here.</i>

21
00:00:42,816 --> 00:00:44,452
<i>I feel the same way about you.</i>

22
00:00:44,539 --> 00:00:45,808
This is nice.

23
00:00:45,896 --> 00:00:48,715
All my friends hanging out,
watching<i> Ellen.</i>

24
00:00:48,886 --> 00:00:51,933
It's like, what am I gonna do
with my other two wishes?

25
00:00:52,756 --> 00:00:54,939
It's not nice.
She's having on the scientists

26
00:00:55,027 --> 00:00:57,189
who are trying to steal
our Nobel Prize.

27
00:00:57,277 --> 00:00:59,322
Although I will enjoy
watching her expose

28
00:00:59,410 --> 00:01:00,377
Pemberton and Campbell

29
00:01:00,465 --> 00:01:02,621
for the coattail-riding
frauds that they are.

30
00:01:02,709 --> 00:01:05,535
That is Ellen's brand,
gotcha journalism.

31
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:07,682
Yeah, you should've
seen her take down

32
00:01:07,769 --> 00:01:08,962
John Krasinski last week.

33
00:01:09,050 --> 00:01:12,222
Got him to admit he loved
his wife. It was brutal.

34
00:01:12,341 --> 00:01:14,119
(shushing)
All right, our next guests

35
00:01:14,207 --> 00:01:16,337
are a couple of physicists...
Don't turn the channel.

36
00:01:16,425 --> 00:01:18,470
They've been doing
some viral videos online

37
00:01:18,558 --> 00:01:21,322
about what it's like to be in
the running for a Nobel Prize.

38
00:01:21,410 --> 00:01:23,292
Please welcome
Doctors Greg Pemberton

39
00:01:23,379 --> 00:01:25,111
and Kevin Campbell.

40
00:01:25,261 --> 00:01:27,640
(cheering, applause)

41
00:01:28,815 --> 00:01:31,185
Why does she even want
to have scientists on?

42
00:01:31,319 --> 00:01:33,777
Uh, silly question.
Who else will give her audience

43
00:01:33,865 --> 00:01:36,193
causal explanations of
natural phenomena?

44
00:01:36,281 --> 00:01:38,943
I love you, honey, but think.

45
00:01:39,896 --> 00:01:40,865
So you guys

46
00:01:40,953 --> 00:01:43,581
have discovered something
pretty amazing in the universe.

47
00:01:43,669 --> 00:01:46,378
Obviously, I understand, uh,
high-level physics

48
00:01:46,466 --> 00:01:48,482
because I'm a comedian, but...
(laughter)

49
00:01:49,339 --> 00:01:51,458
...can you explain it
to the audience?

50
00:01:51,615 --> 00:01:53,677
Well, I don't know, I'm not
sure we're even smart enough

51
00:01:53,764 --> 00:01:55,064
to understand it.
(laughter)

52
00:01:56,943 --> 00:01:59,628
Look, look, the audience is
laughing at them. It's starting.

53
00:01:59,716 --> 00:02:03,013
I hate to say it, Sheldon, but
I think the audience likes them.

54
00:02:03,146 --> 00:02:05,550
Well, that will all change
when Ellen asks them

55
00:02:05,638 --> 00:02:08,691
how super-asymmetry explains the
cosmological excess of matter

56
00:02:08,779 --> 00:02:10,581
over anti-matter
and they panic,

57
00:02:10,669 --> 00:02:12,972
like Leonard trying
to do a pull-up.

58
00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:14,808
Hey, what'd I do?

59
00:02:14,896 --> 00:02:16,716
Not a pull-up.

60
00:02:17,331 --> 00:02:19,089
People have been
loving your videos,

61
00:02:19,177 --> 00:02:21,488
especially the-the songs
that you've been posting.

62
00:02:21,576 --> 00:02:22,394
- Oh, thanks.
- Thank you.

63
00:02:22,482 --> 00:02:24,952
Uh, this may be pushing
it, but I have to ask.

64
00:02:25,039 --> 00:02:27,855
Would you mind singing one
of those for us right now?

65
00:02:27,943 --> 00:02:29,922
- Oh, why not?
- All right.

66
00:02:30,009 --> 00:02:33,271
Come on, Ellen, they're right there.
Go for the jugular.

67
00:02:33,579 --> 00:02:36,956
? Let's get physicist,
physicist ?

68
00:02:37,044 --> 00:02:39,794
? I want to get physicist ?

69
00:02:39,912 --> 00:02:42,544
? Let's get into physicist ?

70
00:02:42,685 --> 00:02:44,982
? Let me hear your boson talk ?

71
00:02:45,070 --> 00:02:48,802
- Come on, Ellen.
- ? Let me hear your boson talk... ?

72
00:02:48,890 --> 00:02:52,357
<i>? Our whole universe
was in a hot, dense state ?</i>

73
00:02:52,445 --> 00:02:56,193
<i>? Then nearly 14 billion years
ago expansion started... Wait! ?</i>

74
00:02:56,294 --> 00:02:57,511
<i>? The Earth began to cool ?</i>

75
00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:00,511
<i>? The autotrophs began to drool,
Neanderthals developed tools ?</i>

76
00:03:00,599 --> 00:03:02,334
? We built the Wall ?
? We built the pyramids ?

77
00:03:02,421 --> 00:03:05,340
<i>? Math, Science, History,
unraveling the mystery ?</i>

78
00:03:05,449 --> 00:03:07,262
<i>? That all started
with a big bang ?</i>

79
00:03:07,350 --> 00:03:09,412
<i>? Bang! ?</i>

Doctors Pemberton and Campbell.

84
00:03:21,614 --> 00:03:22,451
Morning, buddy.

85
00:03:22,539 --> 00:03:23,810
I am not your buddy.

86
00:03:23,968 --> 00:03:25,990
- What's wrong?
- I'll tell you what's wrong.

87
00:03:26,078 --> 00:03:28,466
You went on TV
and were charming.

88
00:03:28,823 --> 00:03:31,318
Thanks, man.
That's what my mom said.

89
00:03:31,818 --> 00:03:32,842
PEMBERTON:
W-Why don't you come in

90
00:03:32,929 --> 00:03:34,263
- and have some parfait?
- Yeah,

91
00:03:34,351 --> 00:03:36,818
we ordered it from room service;
it cost, like, 12 bucks.

92
00:03:36,906 --> 00:03:39,359
It's just yogurt in a glass.

93
00:03:40,287 --> 00:03:41,716
I don't want your yogurt.

94
00:03:41,804 --> 00:03:42,842
Then what do you want?

95
00:03:42,945 --> 00:03:44,404
I want you to hold
a press conference

96
00:03:44,492 --> 00:03:47,175
where you admit that you blindly
stumbled into super-asymmetry

97
00:03:47,263 --> 00:03:48,958
and it was really
our discovery.

98
00:03:49,046 --> 00:03:51,927
Oh. No, thanks.

99
00:03:52,842 --> 00:03:55,107
You know, just because we proved
something by accident

100
00:03:55,195 --> 00:03:56,677
doesn't mean
we didn't prove it.

101
00:03:56,765 --> 00:03:58,099
PEMBERTON:
Yeah, I wasn't trying

102
00:03:58,194 --> 00:03:59,958
to prove that my wife
was cheating on me

103
00:04:00,046 --> 00:04:01,260
when I came home early
one Friday,

104
00:04:01,347 --> 00:04:03,904
but I'm still sleeping
on his couch.

105
00:04:04,452 --> 00:04:06,349
I told you,
you can do better than her.

106
00:04:06,552 --> 00:04:08,216
Thanks. It just hurts.

107
00:04:08,304 --> 00:04:10,852
And when you win that
Nobel Prize, she's gonna realize

108
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:12,802
that she was wrong,
you are not a fraud.

109
00:04:12,890 --> 00:04:14,779
She is not wrong.

110
00:04:15,855 --> 00:04:19,108
Wow, I can't believe
you're siding with Linda.

111
00:04:19,586 --> 00:04:21,076
Shame on you.

112
00:04:25,001 --> 00:04:26,910
Look at this.
They posted another video.

113
00:04:26,998 --> 00:04:28,255
It's not even about science.

114
00:04:28,343 --> 00:04:29,873
They're on a
celebrity bus tour.

115
00:04:29,961 --> 00:04:32,114
Those are fun.
I-I went on one

116
00:04:32,202 --> 00:04:34,162
and saw Tom Hanks talking
to his gardener.

117
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:37,592
He's even nice when you plant
the wrong color azaleas.

118
00:04:38,225 --> 00:04:40,740
Those guys are good at
self-promoting, so what?

119
00:04:40,828 --> 00:04:43,201
No one ever won a Nobel
for being nice.

120
00:04:43,289 --> 00:04:44,123
KOOTHRAPPALI:
Yeah, but if they did,

121
00:04:44,211 --> 00:04:45,374
do you know who would win one?

122
00:04:45,461 --> 00:04:47,310
Are you gonna say Tom Hanks?

123
00:04:47,717 --> 00:04:50,654
He picked up a shovel
and helped the guy replant.

124
00:04:52,303 --> 00:04:54,245
SIEBERT:
Dr. Cooper,

125
00:04:54,333 --> 00:04:55,574
there you are. I just wanted
to tell you not to worry

126
00:04:55,661 --> 00:04:58,044
about this Pemberton
and Campbell publicity blitz.

127
00:04:58,216 --> 00:04:59,329
Are you worried?

128
00:04:59,417 --> 00:05:00,682
Not at all.

129
00:05:00,770 --> 00:05:02,760
Not even a little bit.
(laughs)

130
00:05:03,456 --> 00:05:06,276
Look,
I-It doesn't matter

131
00:05:06,364 --> 00:05:08,057
if they have popular support,

132
00:05:08,145 --> 00:05:10,066
we're gonna get the scientific
community behind us.

133
00:05:10,153 --> 00:05:12,417
He's right, the Nobel Prize
is about the work,

134
00:05:12,505 --> 00:05:15,213
and as your fellow scientists,
we support you and Amy.

135
00:05:15,338 --> 00:05:17,314
That's great, Scooby Gang.

136
00:05:17,886 --> 00:05:20,363
Now, the university
is gonna host

137
00:05:20,451 --> 00:05:22,158
a reception for you
and Dr. Fowler

138
00:05:22,246 --> 00:05:25,502
where we invite as many
academic luminaries as we can,

139
00:05:25,590 --> 00:05:28,043
uh, give them a chance to meet
you, hear about your work.

140
00:05:28,131 --> 00:05:29,892
Uh, that's a great idea.
Uh, yeah.

141
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:32,306
Who needs to be likable
when you have Nobel Laureates

142
00:05:32,394 --> 00:05:33,431
campaigning for you?

143
00:05:33,519 --> 00:05:36,119
Oh, yeah... wait a minute.
Do you not think we're likable?

144
00:05:37,166 --> 00:05:38,658
That's what's great about you,

145
00:05:38,746 --> 00:05:41,666
you never stop asking
the tough questions.

146
00:05:47,451 --> 00:05:48,720
(door closes)

147
00:05:50,057 --> 00:05:51,595
Hey. Kids asleep?

148
00:05:51,683 --> 00:05:54,002
Nope. I've been trying
to get them down for hours.

149
00:05:54,090 --> 00:05:56,008
Apparently, Halley's afraid
of the dark now

150
00:05:56,096 --> 00:05:57,080
and I can't turn on
the night-light

151
00:05:57,167 --> 00:05:58,315
'cause it makes Michael cry.

152
00:05:58,403 --> 00:05:59,932
Why doesn't he like
the night-light?

153
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:01,698
Jot that down,
we can ask him

154
00:06:01,786 --> 00:06:03,698
as soon as he learns to speak.

155
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:08,275
We can also find out what's
so damn funny about birds.

156
00:06:09,229 --> 00:06:10,783
(Halley fusses)

157
00:06:10,871 --> 00:06:12,900
I'll go talk to her.

158
00:06:13,025 --> 00:06:16,002
I don't know why she's suddenly
so afraid of everything.

159
00:06:16,188 --> 00:06:19,127
Honey, remember,
she's my child, too.

160
00:06:23,753 --> 00:06:25,244
WOLOWITZ (over monitor):
Hey, sweetie,

161
00:06:25,378 --> 00:06:27,299
I heard you were afraid
of the dark.

162
00:06:27,497 --> 00:06:30,690
I know someone else
who was afraid of the dark once.

163
00:06:31,027 --> 00:06:33,410
Your daddy,
when he was in space.

164
00:06:33,497 --> 00:06:34,502
(Wolowitz chuckles)

165
00:06:34,590 --> 00:06:37,768
And just like you,
I was wearing a full diaper.

166
00:06:41,002 --> 00:06:42,220
Hey, good news.

167
00:06:42,307 --> 00:06:44,768
They're inviting several Nobel
Laureates to our reception.

168
00:06:44,856 --> 00:06:46,499
Oh, great, like who?

169
00:06:46,587 --> 00:06:48,740
Uh... Makoto Kobayashi.

170
00:06:48,828 --> 00:06:50,080
Da... ooh.

171
00:06:51,752 --> 00:06:52,900
What?

172
00:06:52,988 --> 00:06:54,899
Well, I may have been
less than kind to him

173
00:06:54,987 --> 00:06:57,119
about his Nobel Prize win.

174
00:06:57,629 --> 00:06:58,642
Why?

175
00:06:58,730 --> 00:07:00,783
I was jealous, angry
and new to Twitter.

176
00:07:00,903 --> 00:07:02,596
It was a dangerous combination.

177
00:07:03,275 --> 00:07:05,719
Okay, so scratch Kobayashi.

178
00:07:05,807 --> 00:07:07,479
Uh, George Smoot's on here.

179
00:07:07,567 --> 00:07:09,455
(hisses, groans)

180
00:07:10,274 --> 00:07:12,777
We have a history.

181
00:07:13,551 --> 00:07:14,707
Saul Perlmutter?

182
00:07:14,795 --> 00:07:16,418
(groans):
Oh!

183
00:07:17,902 --> 00:07:19,496
What about Kip Thorne?

184
00:07:19,584 --> 00:07:21,396
(stammers)
That was a misunderstanding.

185
00:07:21,484 --> 00:07:23,590
I didn't know
he was right behind me.

186
00:07:25,098 --> 00:07:28,169
So you've alienated everyone
we need to help us?

187
00:07:28,257 --> 00:07:30,588
Well, Amy, if I had known
that someday we'd need them,

188
00:07:30,676 --> 00:07:32,918
I would never
have insulted them.

189
00:07:33,543 --> 00:07:35,668
- Well, that doesn't make it better.
- Oh.

190
00:07:36,066 --> 00:07:38,027
Well, it's also not true.

191
00:07:42,758 --> 00:07:45,379
(door opens, closes)

192
00:07:48,004 --> 00:07:50,012
Hey.
Hey.

193
00:07:50,506 --> 00:07:52,402
Oh, that's cute.

194
00:07:52,699 --> 00:07:55,090
Did Halley draw that
at preschool?

195
00:07:57,142 --> 00:07:58,385
I drew it.

196
00:07:58,473 --> 00:07:59,957
Well, good night.

197
00:08:01,738 --> 00:08:03,683
It's supposed to be
an astronaut.

198
00:08:04,261 --> 00:08:07,260
And I'm supposed to be
living on my own at this age,

199
00:08:07,348 --> 00:08:10,441
but here we are.

200
00:08:11,238 --> 00:08:13,994
Halley was scared and Howard
told her the sweetest story

201
00:08:14,082 --> 00:08:16,572
about when he was in space
and I thought I could turn it

202
00:08:16,668 --> 00:08:18,020
into a book for her and Michael.

203
00:08:18,108 --> 00:08:20,689
Oh, well, I mean,
I am an artist.

204
00:08:20,777 --> 00:08:22,965
Uh, I-if you want,
I could do the drawings.

205
00:08:23,053 --> 00:08:24,918
- Really? That'd be amazing.
- Yeah,

206
00:08:25,006 --> 00:08:26,819
it'd be fun. And a,

207
00:08:26,907 --> 00:08:29,160
a nice change of pace
from what I usually draw.

208
00:08:29,248 --> 00:08:30,559
What do you usually draw?

209
00:08:30,686 --> 00:08:32,035
Well, good night.

210
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:37,512
(device chimes)

211
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,246
- Someone texting you?
- Uh, no,

212
00:08:39,334 --> 00:08:41,551
I just met my exercise
goal for the day.

213
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:46,910
By doing the dishes?

214
00:08:46,998 --> 00:08:49,793
Hey, you have your goals,
I have mine.

215
00:08:51,751 --> 00:08:53,769
- Hello.
- What are you two doing?

216
00:08:53,857 --> 00:08:56,035
Mm, just finishing a workout.

217
00:08:56,613 --> 00:08:57,696
What's up?

218
00:08:57,798 --> 00:08:59,281
Do you have any cookie dough?

219
00:08:59,517 --> 00:09:02,230
Uh, I think so.
Let me see.

220
00:09:02,707 --> 00:09:07,035
Yeah, we've got, uh, chocolate
chip and oatmeal raisin.

221
00:09:07,123 --> 00:09:08,476
Oatmeal raisin?

222
00:09:08,564 --> 00:09:11,176
I know at least two things wrong
with that cookie.

223
00:09:11,884 --> 00:09:13,683
It's for the Nobel Laureates.

224
00:09:13,779 --> 00:09:16,723
We need them on our side,
but unfortunately, Sheldon...

225
00:09:16,811 --> 00:09:19,824
No. "Unfortunately, Sheldon..."
that's all you got to say.

226
00:09:20,550 --> 00:09:22,697
Well, that's... so you need
these people's support

227
00:09:22,785 --> 00:09:24,361
and you're sending
them baked goods?

228
00:09:24,449 --> 00:09:25,535
Yeah, they're pretty smart.

229
00:09:25,623 --> 00:09:27,565
Don't you think they're gonna
realize it's just a bribe?

230
00:09:27,652 --> 00:09:29,689
No, you'd think,
but sometimes brilliant people

231
00:09:29,777 --> 00:09:32,824
can be painfully oblivious
to social cues.

232
00:09:35,874 --> 00:09:38,512
Thank you for pointing
that out, Sheldon.

233
00:09:39,771 --> 00:09:41,331
Anytime.

234
00:09:46,504 --> 00:09:48,634
"Sheldon Cooper"? Hmm.

235
00:09:53,442 --> 00:09:54,955
"Sheldon Cooper"?

236
00:09:55,149 --> 00:09:57,010
(scoffs)
Pass.

237
00:09:58,137 --> 00:10:00,949
"Sheldon Cooper." Aw.

238
00:10:02,535 --> 00:10:04,448
Ugh, oatmeal raisin?

239
00:10:04,536 --> 00:10:06,347
Ugh.

240
00:10:07,704 --> 00:10:08,777
(phone chimes)

241
00:10:09,753 --> 00:10:12,261
Oh, it's from Saul Perlmutter.

242
00:10:12,349 --> 00:10:14,017
(gasps)
He sent me a picture.

243
00:10:14,105 --> 00:10:15,300
Ooh, let me see.

244
00:10:15,387 --> 00:10:19,422
Oh, he arranged the cookies
to spell out "thank you."

245
00:10:20,902 --> 00:10:23,527
Sheldon, that word
isn't "thank."

246
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:32,386
Hi. I got you a surprise.

247
00:10:32,536 --> 00:10:35,081
What... Oh. (chuckles)
What's the occasion?

248
00:10:35,270 --> 00:10:37,540
I heard you tell Halley
that story the other night,

249
00:10:37,644 --> 00:10:39,212
and I thought
it was so sweet

250
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:42,410
that Stuart and I
turned it into a book.

251
00:10:43,182 --> 00:10:45,971
<i>The Frightened
Little Astronaut?</i>

252
00:10:47,824 --> 00:10:50,589
That looks
just like you.

253
00:10:51,121 --> 00:10:54,057
Look how tiny
and scared you look.

254
00:10:54,805 --> 00:10:56,959
And the best part is,
Stuart showed it

255
00:10:57,047 --> 00:10:58,285
to a publisher
friend of his,

256
00:10:58,373 --> 00:10:59,586
and they're interested in it.

257
00:10:59,747 --> 00:11:02,847
That is so cool.
Absolutely not.

258
00:11:03,614 --> 00:11:04,657
Why?

259
00:11:04,745 --> 00:11:07,261
Because I don't want
the whole world to know

260
00:11:07,349 --> 00:11:09,549
I was the frightened
little astronaut!

261
00:11:12,924 --> 00:11:16,557
Maybe you should've called it
<i>The Bitchy Little Astronaut.</i>

262
00:11:20,894 --> 00:11:22,917
You want to tell me
what's going on?

263
00:11:23,457 --> 00:11:25,323
Is my distress
that obvious?

264
00:11:25,437 --> 00:11:27,461
Sheldon, please don't
take this the wrong way,

265
00:11:27,549 --> 00:11:29,125
but when you're quiet
even for a second,

266
00:11:29,213 --> 00:11:30,628
something's wrong.

267
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:33,120
Well, it's true.

268
00:11:33,317 --> 00:11:35,706
The fact is, I feel
really bad for Amy.

269
00:11:35,794 --> 00:11:36,977
Well, we all do.

270
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:39,221
But just for fun,
why do<i> you?</i>

271
00:11:40,689 --> 00:11:42,377
Well, she didn't
do anything wrong,

272
00:11:42,465 --> 00:11:46,090
but she's paying for my mistakes.
Wow.

273
00:11:46,207 --> 00:11:47,285
What?

274
00:11:47,402 --> 00:11:50,010
No... I'm just
honestly impressed.

275
00:11:50,097 --> 00:11:53,080
When did you start caring
about other people's feelings?

276
00:11:53,167 --> 00:11:55,650
Well, I laughed when Amy
got a shock from

277
00:11:55,737 --> 00:11:58,457
the broken Christmas tree
lights, so it was after that.

278
00:12:00,807 --> 00:12:03,613
So none of them are
coming to the reception?

279
00:12:03,701 --> 00:12:05,154
I don't think so.

280
00:12:05,305 --> 00:12:08,660
Okay, what did he say that was
so insulting? (sighs) Well,

281
00:12:09,035 --> 00:12:10,930
he may have suggested there was

282
00:12:11,017 --> 00:12:14,707
an inelegance to the quadrupole
normalization of Smoot's data.

283
00:12:15,027 --> 00:12:16,879
Damn.

284
00:12:19,799 --> 00:12:22,252
See, sometimes I wish I could
invent a time machine,

285
00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:24,373
so I could go back
and prevent myself

286
00:12:24,461 --> 00:12:25,844
from acting so rashly.

287
00:12:25,932 --> 00:12:29,515
Or moving forward, you could
think before you speak.

288
00:12:30,285 --> 00:12:31,629
I suppose so.

289
00:12:31,717 --> 00:12:35,036
But the time machine thing
is probably more likely.

290
00:12:36,153 --> 00:12:38,659
My problem is that
I don't always know

291
00:12:38,747 --> 00:12:40,060
when I've gone too far.

292
00:12:40,223 --> 00:12:42,958
Well, uh, if you like,
I could try to help you out.

293
00:12:43,046 --> 00:12:46,403
You know, and maybe let you know
if you're crossing a line.

294
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:49,240
Oh, you mean, like,
with a code word? Sure.

295
00:12:49,489 --> 00:12:51,741
How's "shut up"?

296
00:12:53,165 --> 00:12:55,222
That's perfect.
People say it to me all the time,

297
00:12:55,310 --> 00:12:56,677
no one will suspect.

298
00:12:59,527 --> 00:13:02,661
- Hey, got a minute?
- Sure. What's up?

299
00:13:02,749 --> 00:13:04,606
Uh, Bernadette said

300
00:13:04,694 --> 00:13:06,307
you weren't crazy
about the book.

301
00:13:06,394 --> 00:13:07,841
No. (chuckles)
It's great.

302
00:13:07,929 --> 00:13:09,436
I just don't want anyone
to ever see it

303
00:13:09,523 --> 00:13:11,096
or read it or know it exists.

304
00:13:11,536 --> 00:13:13,708
But this could be
really good for me,

305
00:13:13,796 --> 00:13:16,278
you know? Finally get
my artwork published.

306
00:13:16,366 --> 00:13:18,747
And-and come on,
it's a, it's a cute story.

307
00:13:18,835 --> 00:13:20,349
Oh, easy for you
to say.

308
00:13:20,437 --> 00:13:22,396
No one's gonna think
you're a coward.

309
00:13:22,647 --> 00:13:24,396
Are you kidding?
The other day

310
00:13:24,484 --> 00:13:27,669
in the comic book store,
a balloon popped and I threw up.

311
00:13:30,576 --> 00:13:33,086
Can't you just
take my name off it?

312
00:13:33,189 --> 00:13:36,302
No, uh, the only reason
the publisher's interested

313
00:13:36,390 --> 00:13:38,543
is 'cause a real astronaut
wrote it.

314
00:13:38,631 --> 00:13:41,984
Well, look, what if
we made a few changes?

315
00:13:42,072 --> 00:13:43,609
Uh, sure, yes.

316
00:13:43,697 --> 00:13:46,359
- What-what do you have in mind?
- Well, nothing major.

317
00:13:46,447 --> 00:13:47,663
But see here on the
cover, where it says

318
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:49,712
"frightened little,"
what if, I don't know,

319
00:13:49,815 --> 00:13:51,734
it didn't say that?

320
00:13:53,171 --> 00:13:56,265
So, it would just be
<i>The Astronaut?</i>

321
00:13:56,433 --> 00:13:58,839
Yeah, you're right.
That doesn't quite pop.

322
00:13:58,927 --> 00:14:02,036
What about...
<i>The Brave Astronaut?</i>

323
00:14:02,124 --> 00:14:04,554
See, that's got
some zip to it!

324
00:14:05,996 --> 00:14:06,996
Okay.

325
00:14:07,084 --> 00:14:09,852
And here on this page,
where I'm crying.

326
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:12,653
What if, instead,
I'm... punching a meteor

327
00:14:12,756 --> 00:14:15,053
into the sun with
my bare fists?

328
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:17,951
So you have superpowers?

329
00:14:18,803 --> 00:14:20,639
I like the way
you're thinking.

330
00:14:24,388 --> 00:14:25,583
Professor Thorne?

331
00:14:25,671 --> 00:14:26,856
Dr. Hofstadter.

332
00:14:26,944 --> 00:14:28,692
Uh, you know
my wife, Penny.

333
00:14:28,780 --> 00:14:29,825
- Sure. Hi.
- PENNY: Hi.

334
00:14:29,913 --> 00:14:33,109
(laughs) Uh, we wanted to
talk to you about Dr. Cooper.

335
00:14:33,197 --> 00:14:34,161
Now, before you say no...

336
00:14:34,249 --> 00:14:35,536
No.

337
00:14:36,998 --> 00:14:38,808
Well, then, after you say no.

338
00:14:38,896 --> 00:14:40,239
No.

339
00:14:41,098 --> 00:14:43,099
Okay, look, Sheldon's
a pain in the ass.

340
00:14:43,187 --> 00:14:44,716
But Dr. Fowler's
really nice.

341
00:14:44,804 --> 00:14:47,919
So if you average
them out... math...

342
00:14:48,702 --> 00:14:50,763
...you got someone
who's okay.

343
00:14:51,017 --> 00:14:51,960
(stammers) But more

344
00:14:52,047 --> 00:14:54,505
than the person,
the Nobel is about the work.

345
00:14:54,593 --> 00:14:55,947
You should understand that
more than anyone.

346
00:14:56,034 --> 00:14:58,232
Yes, because of your work
on gravitational waves.

347
00:14:58,320 --> 00:14:59,463
You know my work?

348
00:14:59,752 --> 00:15:02,239
I do. But I'm-I'm really
hogging this conversation.

349
00:15:02,327 --> 00:15:03,528
Leonard?
(clears throat)

350
00:15:03,726 --> 00:15:05,346
Just give them a chance.

351
00:15:05,434 --> 00:15:07,942
Uh, science has a history
of difficult people.

352
00:15:08,030 --> 00:15:09,365
Look at, uh,
Newton, who was

353
00:15:09,453 --> 00:15:12,379
a jerk to Leibniz, and Leibniz,
who was a jerk to everyone.

354
00:15:12,467 --> 00:15:14,225
Yeah, you know, and I
don't need to tell you

355
00:15:14,313 --> 00:15:16,292
that gravitational waves
are disturbances

356
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:18,108
in the curvature
of space-time.

357
00:15:18,196 --> 00:15:21,381
Or that the... Hey, you worked
on the movie<i> Interstellar?</i>

358
00:15:27,119 --> 00:15:28,506
So what do you think?

359
00:15:29,310 --> 00:15:30,693
I think if you were in space

360
00:15:30,781 --> 00:15:33,412
without a shirt on, you'd die.

361
00:15:34,614 --> 00:15:35,685
Oh.

362
00:15:35,773 --> 00:15:37,342
No, I am wearing
a shirt.

363
00:15:37,430 --> 00:15:40,686
It's just skintight,
so you can see my pecs.

364
00:15:41,427 --> 00:15:43,147
When did you get pecs?

365
00:15:44,303 --> 00:15:46,811
Yesterday, when I made
Stuart add them.

366
00:15:47,767 --> 00:15:49,668
Howie, what I liked
about the other story

367
00:15:49,756 --> 00:15:50,850
was that it was real.

368
00:15:50,937 --> 00:15:53,460
I mean, nothing in this
actually happened to you.

369
00:15:53,547 --> 00:15:55,897
(chuckles):
So, it's a children's book.

370
00:15:55,985 --> 00:15:57,545
I mean, cats
don't wear hats.

371
00:15:57,633 --> 00:15:59,526
And if someone gives you
green eggs, it ends

372
00:15:59,614 --> 00:16:02,162
with you on the toilet
trying to make a deal with God.

373
00:16:04,075 --> 00:16:06,295
But the real story was so sweet.

374
00:16:06,383 --> 00:16:08,076
The little astronaut
was afraid,

375
00:16:08,164 --> 00:16:10,577
but he still went to space,
and that's what made him brave.

376
00:16:10,884 --> 00:16:14,477
(scoffs) But in space,
the other astronauts...

377
00:16:14,798 --> 00:16:17,397
made fun of him,
and that's a thing

378
00:16:17,485 --> 00:16:19,173
he doesn't want to relive.

379
00:16:19,985 --> 00:16:21,391
I get that.

380
00:16:23,033 --> 00:16:24,813
I guess it would
just take a really

381
00:16:24,901 --> 00:16:27,068
brave man to put an embarrassing
story like that

382
00:16:27,156 --> 00:16:29,384
out into the world,
just so it might help

383
00:16:29,472 --> 00:16:31,837
some frightened children
not feel so alone.

384
00:16:32,657 --> 00:16:35,805
Wow. That is
quite the guilt trip.

385
00:16:38,548 --> 00:16:40,462
Are you sure you're not Jewish?

386
00:16:44,039 --> 00:16:46,977
I'm just a wife that is
so proud of her husband,

387
00:16:47,065 --> 00:16:48,625
and doesn't think
that he has anything

388
00:16:48,713 --> 00:16:50,726
- to be embarrassed about.
- Oh.

389
00:16:51,478 --> 00:16:53,580
You're sounding
less and less Jewish.

390
00:16:56,177 --> 00:16:58,057
Hey, we just heard that
you're the ones

391
00:16:58,145 --> 00:16:59,928
who convinced
the Nobel Laureates to come.

392
00:17:00,027 --> 00:17:01,081
- Thank you.
- You are welcome.

393
00:17:01,168 --> 00:17:02,305
You guys deserve this.

394
00:17:02,393 --> 00:17:04,804
Yeah, now get out of here,
go talk to some smart people.

395
00:17:06,195 --> 00:17:08,660
- Wait a minute.
- Yeah, sorry. Sometimes I forget

396
00:17:08,721 --> 00:17:11,004
you're smart because
you're so sexy.

397
00:17:11,468 --> 00:17:13,351
I can see that.
Yeah.

398
00:17:14,379 --> 00:17:15,884
Dr. Cooper.
Dr. Fowler.

399
00:17:15,972 --> 00:17:18,320
I was just telling Professor
Arnold how you came up with

400
00:17:18,408 --> 00:17:20,151
super-asymmetry
at your wedding.

401
00:17:20,279 --> 00:17:21,953
It's a wonderful story.

402
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:23,351
Ha, it really is.

403
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:25,679
I wouldn't say it was the
highlight of the wedding,

404
00:17:25,767 --> 00:17:27,226
because I've been
told not to

405
00:17:27,314 --> 00:17:29,250
for reasons I don't
fully understand.

406
00:17:29,338 --> 00:17:32,086
Uh, but what he does understand
is how the universe works,

407
00:17:32,174 --> 00:17:33,265
and that's
what's important.

408
00:17:33,353 --> 00:17:35,578
Not what comes out
of his mouth. (laughs)

409
00:17:39,108 --> 00:17:40,218
Uh-oh.

410
00:17:40,758 --> 00:17:42,622
I haven't been to a lot of
parties like this,

411
00:17:42,710 --> 00:17:45,444
but what does a physics
rumble look like?

412
00:17:46,164 --> 00:17:48,504
- Kind of like angry chickens.
- Hmm.

413
00:17:48,592 --> 00:17:51,989
Or-or-or-or like, uh,
when-when puppets fight.

414
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:55,579
Dr. Cooper, Dr. Fowler,
good to see you.

415
00:17:55,667 --> 00:17:56,750
What are you doing here?

416
00:17:56,837 --> 00:17:57,918
Professor Smoot
invited us.

417
00:17:58,006 --> 00:18:00,325
- We're Facebook friends.
- Smooty!

418
00:18:02,107 --> 00:18:05,249
Well, this is our
reception, so go away.

419
00:18:05,337 --> 00:18:06,260
SHELDON:
Actually, Amy,

420
00:18:06,347 --> 00:18:07,793
I think we should
let them stay.

421
00:18:07,881 --> 00:18:09,394
Please, enjoy yourselves.

422
00:18:09,482 --> 00:18:11,059
Try some pigs
in blankets.

423
00:18:11,147 --> 00:18:13,100
And yes, that
is the plural.

424
00:18:13,351 --> 00:18:14,951
Great.
Thanks.

425
00:18:16,428 --> 00:18:17,751
What are you doing?

426
00:18:17,839 --> 00:18:19,292
If they stay,
everyone will see

427
00:18:19,427 --> 00:18:20,638
that their grasp
on super-asymmetry

428
00:18:20,725 --> 00:18:21,918
is tenuous at best.

429
00:18:22,286 --> 00:18:24,004
Oh. That's clever.

430
00:18:24,092 --> 00:18:26,801
Yeah, I don't just know
the plurals of things, Amy.

431
00:18:28,189 --> 00:18:29,379
Is this gonna be
a problem?

432
00:18:29,475 --> 00:18:31,356
Mm? No, no, no.
We have a plan.

433
00:18:31,444 --> 00:18:33,249
Uh, Dr. Campbell
and Pemberton,

434
00:18:33,337 --> 00:18:35,379
settle a bet for
Dr. Fowler and me?

435
00:18:35,467 --> 00:18:37,520
We were just discussing,
under what conditions

436
00:18:37,608 --> 00:18:39,848
the radiative corrections
to super-asymmetry

437
00:18:39,936 --> 00:18:42,049
could cause time
variation of alpha E.M.?

438
00:18:42,223 --> 00:18:45,960
AMY: I say active galactic
nuclei at cosmological distances

439
00:18:46,047 --> 00:18:47,430
show a part per
million deviation.

440
00:18:47,517 --> 00:18:48,543
Dr. Cooper says

441
00:18:48,631 --> 00:18:51,864
this has been disproven recently
with quasar observations.

442
00:18:52,014 --> 00:18:53,114
What do<i> you</i> think?

443
00:18:58,052 --> 00:18:59,522
I agree with<i> you.</i>

444
00:19:02,153 --> 00:19:03,423
Good answer.

445
00:19:03,886 --> 00:19:05,754
Hey, uh, if we haven't
said it before,

446
00:19:05,891 --> 00:19:09,034
we just want to say...
thank you.

447
00:19:09,136 --> 00:19:11,973
Yeah. We couldn't have proven
super-asymmetry without you.

448
00:19:12,061 --> 00:19:13,504
Wait-wait. You all
heard them say it.

449
00:19:13,592 --> 00:19:15,293
They didn't do anything.

450
00:19:16,317 --> 00:19:19,291
Sheldon. Shut up.
Yeah... Well, that's rude.

451
00:19:19,379 --> 00:19:20,161
No. Shut up.

452
00:19:20,249 --> 00:19:21,965
Oh, the code
word, thank you.

453
00:19:22,837 --> 00:19:24,289
You know, it's strange.
A few months ago,

454
00:19:24,376 --> 00:19:26,385
nobody paid any attention to us,
and now all of a sudden,

455
00:19:26,472 --> 00:19:27,915
we're getting all
these accolades.

456
00:19:28,003 --> 00:19:29,548
Yeah, have-have any
of you ever felt like

457
00:19:29,635 --> 00:19:30,948
maybe you didn't
deserve it?

458
00:19:31,036 --> 00:19:32,649
Leonard, there's
something I need to say.

459
00:19:32,737 --> 00:19:34,422
- Shut up.
- Okay.

460
00:19:35,627 --> 00:19:38,210
It's crazy. We conclusively
proved super-asymmetry,

461
00:19:38,297 --> 00:19:41,220
and yet somehow we,
we still feel like imposters.

462
00:19:41,307 --> 00:19:42,820
There should be
a term for that.

463
00:19:42,907 --> 00:19:45,520
Oh, for crying out loud,
there<i> is</i> a term for that!

464
00:19:45,607 --> 00:19:47,391
It's called
"imposter syndrome"

465
00:19:47,479 --> 00:19:48,539
and you don't have it!

466
00:19:48,627 --> 00:19:50,992
Because you can't have it
if you<i> are</i> imposters,

467
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:52,210
and you<i> are!</i>

468
00:19:52,298 --> 00:19:53,361
We're the ones

469
00:19:53,449 --> 00:19:54,953
who discovered super-asymmetry!

470
00:19:55,041 --> 00:19:56,210
So if anyone's
gonna feel like

471
00:19:56,298 --> 00:19:57,453
they have
imposter syndrome,

472
00:19:57,541 --> 00:20:00,906
it's us, because we're not
imposters!<i> They</i> are!

473
00:20:00,994 --> 00:20:04,070
You're imposters
and you're frauds!

474
00:20:09,872 --> 00:20:12,027
- Is that what I would've sounded like?
- Yeah.

475
00:20:12,115 --> 00:20:13,645
Yikes!

476
00:20:17,664 --> 00:20:20,260
A time,
there was a little astronaut

477
00:20:20,347 --> 00:20:21,688
<i>who was sitting in a rocket</i>

478
00:20:21,776 --> 00:20:24,982
- <i>waiting to go to space."</i>
- MAN (over radio): Three... two... one...

479
00:20:25,070 --> 00:20:26,730
WOLOWITZ: <i>And while all
the other astronauts</i>

480
00:20:26,791 --> 00:20:29,320
<i>laughed and joked,
he stayed quiet,</i>

481
00:20:29,408 --> 00:20:31,031
<i>because he had a secret.</i>

482
00:20:31,156 --> 00:20:34,797
<i>He was scared.
He had another secret, too.</i>

483
00:20:34,914 --> 00:20:37,617
<i>He was only pretending to be
scared to trick the alien king.</i>

484
00:20:38,367 --> 00:20:40,227
Ha-ha!

485
00:20:41,367 --> 00:20:42,687
BERNADETTE:
Howie.

486
00:20:43,585 --> 00:20:44,715
Fine.

487
00:20:44,803 --> 00:20:47,007
There was no alien.
(chuckles)

488
00:20:49,514 --> 00:20:51,980
There was a bossy wife, though.
We'll get to her later.
