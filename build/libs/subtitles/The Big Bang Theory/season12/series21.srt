1
00:00:00,355 --> 00:00:01,787
<i>Previously on</i>
The Big Bang Theory...

2
00:00:01,950 --> 00:00:04,258
We conclusively proved
super-asymmetry,

3
00:00:04,259 --> 00:00:07,406
and yet somehow
we-we still feel like imposters.

4
00:00:07,407 --> 00:00:09,173
Yeah, there should be
a term for that.

5
00:00:09,242 --> 00:00:11,909
Oh, for crying out loud,
there is a term for that!

6
00:00:11,978 --> 00:00:14,011
It's called
"imposter syndrome,"

7
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:16,080
and you don't have it,
because you can't have it

8
00:00:16,149 --> 00:00:18,349
if you are imposters,
and you are!

9
00:00:18,418 --> 00:00:21,285
We're the ones who discovered
super-asymmetry,

10
00:00:21,354 --> 00:00:23,674
so if anyone's gonna feel like
they have imposter syndrome,

11
00:00:23,723 --> 00:00:27,458
it's us because we're
not imposters, they are!

12
00:00:27,527 --> 00:00:30,461
You're imposters
and you're frauds!

13
00:00:33,466 --> 00:00:35,833
I think what President Siebert
is trying to say is that

14
00:00:35,902 --> 00:00:38,669
this is a setback and we should
adopt a different strategy.

15
00:00:38,738 --> 00:00:41,305
I-I'm sorry.
I-I just-- I-I snapped.

16
00:00:41,374 --> 00:00:43,941
Oh, you're sorry.
It's all better, then.

17
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:46,777
Listen up, you have shot
to win a Nobel Prize,

18
00:00:46,846 --> 00:00:48,179
and you're blowing it.

19
00:00:48,248 --> 00:00:50,381
I think what President Siebert
is trying to say

20
00:00:50,450 --> 00:00:52,817
is that you have a shot
to win a Nobel Prize,

21
00:00:52,886 --> 00:00:55,419
and you're blowing it.

22
00:00:55,488 --> 00:00:58,856
Uh, that's exactly
what he said.

23
00:00:58,925 --> 00:01:02,160
Yes, but I said it
in my calming HR voice.

24
00:01:05,137 --> 00:01:07,114
So, obviously,

25
00:01:07,115 --> 00:01:09,315
I'm really sorry
about my outburst.

26
00:01:09,384 --> 00:01:11,584
Calling you frauds
was unacceptable.

27
00:01:11,653 --> 00:01:13,286
I feel terrible
about it.

28
00:01:13,355 --> 00:01:15,221
It has caused her
a lot of stress.

29
00:01:15,290 --> 00:01:16,723
She chewed through
her night guard

30
00:01:16,792 --> 00:01:19,492
like it was a
piece of jerky.

31
00:01:19,561 --> 00:01:21,394
What you said was
really hurtful,

32
00:01:21,463 --> 00:01:23,329
especially because I
thought we were friends.

33
00:01:23,398 --> 00:01:25,532
Why would you think that?

34
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:28,535
Ouch.

35
00:01:28,603 --> 00:01:31,538
Ignore them;
they're just mean people.

36
00:01:31,606 --> 00:01:33,890
Uh, not mean, just sorry.

37
00:01:33,959 --> 00:01:37,210
Seem mean, are sorry.
Happens all the time.

38
00:01:37,279 --> 00:01:39,596
It's okay.
I talked to my therapist,

39
00:01:39,648 --> 00:01:41,581
and she made me realize
that what you said

40
00:01:41,650 --> 00:01:44,317
was really more about
your own insecurities.

41
00:01:46,254 --> 00:01:48,188
I'm sorry, what?

42
00:01:48,256 --> 00:01:50,623
There you go, she's sorry.
We all heard it. Moving on.

43
00:01:50,692 --> 00:01:52,625
Yes, obviously,

44
00:01:52,694 --> 00:01:54,627
you're angry at all
the attention we're getting

45
00:01:54,696 --> 00:01:56,629
for our discovery
and you're lashing out.

46
00:01:56,698 --> 00:01:59,499
Well, uh, technically,
<i>she</i> lashed out.

47
00:01:59,568 --> 00:02:01,801
<i>I</i> contained myself,
which I don't think

48
00:02:01,870 --> 00:02:04,070
I'm getting
enough credit for.

49
00:02:04,139 --> 00:02:06,439
The point is we should
take it as a compliment

50
00:02:06,508 --> 00:02:10,009
that even you guys think
we will win the Nobel Prize.

51
00:02:10,078 --> 00:02:13,279
Uh, no, we-we certainly
do not think that.

52
00:02:13,348 --> 00:02:14,814
The Nobel Committee
will realize

53
00:02:14,883 --> 00:02:16,416
that we came up
with this theory.

54
00:02:16,484 --> 00:02:17,484
But we proved it.

55
00:02:17,552 --> 00:02:18,651
By accident.

56
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:21,254
All breakthroughs
happen by accident.

57
00:02:21,323 --> 00:02:23,990
No, they don't!

58
00:02:25,727 --> 00:02:27,388
Look, the Nobel Committee
doesn't like infighting,

59
00:02:27,412 --> 00:02:29,540
so if the four of you don't stop
sniping at each other,

60
00:02:29,564 --> 00:02:31,364
the award's gonna go
to someone else entirely.

61
00:02:31,433 --> 00:02:33,683
He's right.

62
00:02:33,752 --> 00:02:35,952
You know, like it or not,
we can't avoid each other.

63
00:02:36,021 --> 00:02:38,521
Let's at least
try to be civil.

64
00:02:38,590 --> 00:02:39,590
Agreed.

65
00:02:39,641 --> 00:02:41,407
You know, when you
think about it,

66
00:02:41,476 --> 00:02:45,184
we're linked together the
same way that super-asymmetry

67
00:02:45,185 --> 00:02:47,042
links together every atom
in the universe.

68
00:02:47,043 --> 00:02:48,560
Hmm.

69
00:02:48,561 --> 00:02:51,582
That's not
what it does at all!

70
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:53,940
Well, that's the great thing
about science.

71
00:02:54,008 --> 00:02:56,609
We all get to have
our own opinions.

72
00:03:02,784 --> 00:03:04,149
I'm still not talking.
That's impressive, right?

We're the best team.

88
00:03:49,333 --> 00:03:52,267
Greg Pemberton,
you old so-and-so.

89
00:03:52,336 --> 00:03:53,902
Very good to see you.

90
00:03:53,971 --> 00:03:56,371
Uh, let me introduce you
to my colleague, Dr. Campbell.

91
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:58,685
Uh, Kevin, this is Barry Kripke.
We went to college together.

92
00:03:58,709 --> 00:04:01,376
Great to meet you.
Well, you have my number.

93
00:04:01,445 --> 00:04:03,445
We should hit up the
buffet at the strip club

94
00:04:03,513 --> 00:04:04,980
while you're in town.

95
00:04:05,048 --> 00:04:07,749
Nothing beats a lap dance
and a baked potato bar, huh?

96
00:04:09,086 --> 00:04:10,385
You can come, too.

97
00:04:10,454 --> 00:04:12,454
That's a hard pass.

98
00:04:12,522 --> 00:04:14,823
I'll walk you out.

99
00:04:14,891 --> 00:04:16,858
Good to see you, Barry.

100
00:04:16,927 --> 00:04:19,160
You're the best!

101
00:04:19,229 --> 00:04:20,679
Oh...

102
00:04:20,747 --> 00:04:23,114
God, I hate that guy.

103
00:04:23,183 --> 00:04:26,318
That's strange; you
seem quite fond of him.

104
00:04:26,386 --> 00:04:29,854
I was only being polite.
Pemberton is a grade A weasel.

105
00:04:29,923 --> 00:04:31,756
How do I know you're
not just being polite

106
00:04:31,825 --> 00:04:33,391
when you say it's
nice to see me?

107
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:36,761
I have literally
never said that to you.

108
00:04:38,031 --> 00:04:40,432
Why do you say he's a weasel?

109
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:42,634
Pemberton's whole M.O.

110
00:04:42,703 --> 00:04:45,503
was to take other people's ideas
and turn them in as his own.

111
00:04:45,572 --> 00:04:47,639
That's exactly what
he's doing to us.

112
00:04:47,708 --> 00:04:50,508
I'm not surprised. I heard the
only work he did on his thesis

113
00:04:50,577 --> 00:04:53,812
was googling,
"Where can I buy a thesis?"

114
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:57,916
Well, plagiarism is a pretty
serious charge. Are you sure?

115
00:04:57,985 --> 00:05:00,352
You want proof?
I can make some calls.

116
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:02,187
You'd do that for us?

117
00:05:02,255 --> 00:05:04,402
I really don't want to see
that guy win a Nobel.

118
00:05:04,403 --> 00:05:06,570
I also don't want
to see you win a Nobel.

119
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:08,405
Ooh, this is tricky.

120
00:05:10,242 --> 00:05:12,743
I don't know, Barry.
It sounds a little sleazy.

121
00:05:12,812 --> 00:05:15,746
Well, let me know
if you change your mind.

122
00:05:15,815 --> 00:05:18,582
Sleazy is where I thrive.

123
00:05:22,728 --> 00:05:24,762
So I was talking
to my mom

124
00:05:24,830 --> 00:05:26,286
about our Pemberton
and Campbell situation.

125
00:05:26,287 --> 00:05:27,238
Really? What'd she say?

126
00:05:27,262 --> 00:05:29,832
Apparently, Old Testament God
would bring down his wrath

127
00:05:29,833 --> 00:05:31,408
on them for being deceitful,

128
00:05:31,409 --> 00:05:33,647
but New Testament God
would forgive them.

129
00:05:36,067 --> 00:05:38,362
So couldn't we just
bring down our wrath

130
00:05:38,363 --> 00:05:40,584
and ask the New Testament God
to forgive us?

131
00:05:40,585 --> 00:05:42,637
You know, I asked her
that very question.

132
00:05:42,661 --> 00:05:43,182
And?

133
00:05:43,183 --> 00:05:46,200
She said I was full
of California sass.

134
00:05:47,036 --> 00:05:49,437
Oh, good, you're all here.
Uh, we're wrestling

135
00:05:49,506 --> 00:05:51,806
with an ethical question,
and perhaps you could help.

136
00:05:51,875 --> 00:05:53,441
- Sure, what's up? - Yeah.
- Fire away.

137
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:55,943
If we have damaging
and embarrassing information

138
00:05:56,012 --> 00:05:59,680
about someone, should we keep it
to ourselves or expose them?

139
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:05,972
Quick question: Does it happen
to do with online tastes

140
00:06:05,996 --> 00:06:08,156
that might or might not reflect
their real-life tastes?

141
00:06:10,344 --> 00:06:12,261
I know all about your
tall girl website.

142
00:06:12,262 --> 00:06:13,961
It goes on our
credit card.

143
00:06:16,282 --> 00:06:18,499
It's Dr. Pemberton.

144
00:06:18,568 --> 00:06:20,635
Kripke says
he plagiarized his thesis,

145
00:06:20,703 --> 00:06:22,220
and that he can prove it.

146
00:06:22,288 --> 00:06:25,640
Wow. Well, that's not gonna sit
well with the Nobel Committee.

147
00:06:25,708 --> 00:06:27,708
Hang on. I don't think
it's fair to use something

148
00:06:27,777 --> 00:06:30,211
someone did in school
against them.

149
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:33,381
Relax, he said
it's not you.

150
00:06:33,449 --> 00:06:35,349
I don't know.
If someone's a cheater,

151
00:06:35,418 --> 00:06:38,252
they should be held accountable
no matter how long ago it was.

152
00:06:38,321 --> 00:06:42,156
Okay, now
you just sound crazy.

153
00:06:42,225 --> 00:06:44,258
So you really think
they should do this?

154
00:06:44,327 --> 00:06:46,494
It wouldn't
just knock Pemberton

155
00:06:46,563 --> 00:06:49,497
out of Nobel contention, it
would blow up his whole career.

156
00:06:49,566 --> 00:06:51,899
To that, I say kaboom!

157
00:06:53,570 --> 00:06:56,170
No, I meant
it's a bad thing.

158
00:06:56,239 --> 00:06:57,605
No, no, I agree
with Bernadette.

159
00:06:57,674 --> 00:06:58,906
If Pemberton cheated,

160
00:06:58,975 --> 00:07:01,015
maybe he shouldn't have a career
in the first place.

161
00:07:01,044 --> 00:07:02,922
There's plenty of people
that didn't plagiarize.

162
00:07:02,946 --> 00:07:05,146
And a few of us who did,
but it's only 'cause

163
00:07:05,215 --> 00:07:07,148
<i>The Scarlet Letter</i>
was so boring.

164
00:07:09,085 --> 00:07:11,252
Aw, I love
<i>The Scarlet Letter.</i>

165
00:07:11,321 --> 00:07:14,021
Th-That's where I got
my taste for bad girls.

166
00:07:15,758 --> 00:07:20,328
Ugh, why is this
decision so hard?

167
00:07:20,396 --> 00:07:21,996
Maybe because
you want to win,

168
00:07:22,065 --> 00:07:24,732
but deep down you know it's not
the honorable way to do it.

169
00:07:24,801 --> 00:07:26,312
Otherwise, you would've
done it already.

170
00:07:26,336 --> 00:07:27,969
That's really wise.

171
00:07:28,037 --> 00:07:31,872
Yes, but it may just be
the Indian accent.

172
00:07:35,778 --> 00:07:38,212
Do you think
by not exposing Pemberton

173
00:07:38,248 --> 00:07:40,548
we're doing
the right thing?

174
00:07:40,617 --> 00:07:42,183
Of course.

175
00:07:42,252 --> 00:07:45,453
Unless you think we're not
doing the right thing.

176
00:07:45,521 --> 00:07:47,288
Why would you think
that I don't think

177
00:07:47,357 --> 00:07:48,623
we're doing the right thing?

178
00:07:48,691 --> 00:07:52,293
You might think that if
good people hold themselves

179
00:07:52,362 --> 00:07:54,295
to unrealistically high
ethical standards,

180
00:07:54,364 --> 00:07:57,365
then they might lose out to
their unscrupulous competitors.

181
00:07:57,433 --> 00:07:58,532
Is that what you think?

182
00:07:58,601 --> 00:07:59,800
No.

183
00:07:59,869 --> 00:08:01,636
No, I just thought
if you thought we weren't

184
00:08:01,704 --> 00:08:04,572
doing the right thing,
that's why you might think that.

185
00:08:04,641 --> 00:08:06,841
Well, if I did think that,

186
00:08:06,909 --> 00:08:09,176
you might point out
that people who claim

187
00:08:09,245 --> 00:08:11,612
it's okay to do
bad things to win

188
00:08:11,681 --> 00:08:14,248
are bad people no matter
what they tell themselves.

189
00:08:14,317 --> 00:08:15,983
And I'd be right

190
00:08:16,052 --> 00:08:17,251
to point that out.

191
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:18,986
Because you're a good person.

192
00:08:20,823 --> 00:08:23,391
I love talking
to you.

193
00:08:23,459 --> 00:08:25,926
It's like talking to me,
but with a girl voice.

194
00:08:29,365 --> 00:08:32,266
I'm just saying, Sheldon
and Amy deserve to win,

195
00:08:32,335 --> 00:08:34,502
and sometimes that means
doing what you got to do.

196
00:08:34,570 --> 00:08:37,204
Don't you think it's better
to take the high road?

197
00:08:37,273 --> 00:08:38,572
Yeah, and instead of guns,

198
00:08:38,641 --> 00:08:42,810
armies should carry
candy canes that shoot wishes.

199
00:08:42,879 --> 00:08:44,490
So what's the worst thing
you've ever done

200
00:08:44,514 --> 00:08:46,063
to get something
you wanted?

201
00:08:46,132 --> 00:08:47,665
I'm not gonna
tell you that.

202
00:08:47,734 --> 00:08:50,051
Oh, come on.
I'll tell you mine.

203
00:08:50,119 --> 00:08:52,820
Right,
'cause yours is gonna be

204
00:08:52,889 --> 00:08:55,423
as bad as mine. Okay.

205
00:08:55,491 --> 00:08:57,925
Come on, just tell me.

206
00:08:57,994 --> 00:08:59,860
Okay, fine.

207
00:08:59,929 --> 00:09:02,296
When we first met,
there was another waitress

208
00:09:02,365 --> 00:09:04,376
at The Cheesecake Factory
who thought you were cute,

209
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:09,170
so I told her you had all
the hepatitises, A through Z.

210
00:09:09,238 --> 00:09:11,806
There aren't
26 hepatitises.

211
00:09:11,874 --> 00:09:13,674
Well, if she was smart
enough to know that,

212
00:09:13,743 --> 00:09:16,077
she wouldn't still be working
at a Cheesecake Factory.

213
00:09:16,145 --> 00:09:17,878
Oh, she still works there?
Who was it?

214
00:09:17,947 --> 00:09:19,413
Why does it matter?

215
00:09:19,482 --> 00:09:23,417
You're right, it doesn't matter
'cause I got the best one.

216
00:09:25,288 --> 00:09:26,954
Was it Susan?

217
00:09:27,023 --> 00:09:28,389
Why? Because she's tall?

218
00:09:28,458 --> 00:09:30,591
Good night.

219
00:09:31,994 --> 00:09:34,128
Can't believe it.

220
00:09:34,197 --> 00:09:36,630
Sheldon loves telling on people
when they break the rules.

221
00:09:36,699 --> 00:09:38,733
Yeah, well, maybe he's changed.

222
00:09:38,801 --> 00:09:40,846
He hasn't changed. Last week,
when the vending machine

223
00:09:40,870 --> 00:09:43,971
gave me two bags of chips,
he called my mom.

224
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:45,873
Well, that didn't
ruin your life.

225
00:09:45,942 --> 00:09:47,141
Well, it ruined my day.

226
00:09:47,210 --> 00:09:49,944
I had to talk to my mom,
who, by the way,

227
00:09:50,012 --> 00:09:54,482
is-is polyamorous now,
so that's fun to think about.

228
00:09:54,550 --> 00:09:56,617
Look, I'm proud
of Sheldon and Amy.

229
00:09:56,686 --> 00:09:58,931
You know? They want to win
this thing on their own merits,

230
00:09:58,955 --> 00:10:00,988
not by knocking out
the competition.

231
00:10:01,057 --> 00:10:02,456
Yeah, but what if
they don't win?

232
00:10:02,525 --> 00:10:04,625
Uh, Pemberton and Campbell
have done an amazing job

233
00:10:04,694 --> 00:10:06,794
of associating their names
with super-asymmetry.

234
00:10:06,863 --> 00:10:08,896
They have all
the momentum right now.

235
00:10:08,965 --> 00:10:10,609
I don't like the idea
of them losing either,

236
00:10:10,633 --> 00:10:13,167
but this is their decision
to make, not ours.

237
00:10:14,670 --> 00:10:16,203
Maybe it is ours.

238
00:10:16,272 --> 00:10:17,705
What do you mean?

239
00:10:17,774 --> 00:10:20,875
Well, i-if Sheldon and Amy
don't want to expose Pemberton,

240
00:10:20,943 --> 00:10:23,411
that doesn't mean someone else
can't do it for them.

241
00:10:23,479 --> 00:10:25,146
They'd never have to know.

242
00:10:25,214 --> 00:10:27,014
Really? You'd do that?

243
00:10:27,083 --> 00:10:28,349
They deserve the Nobel.

244
00:10:28,418 --> 00:10:30,851
I'm not gonna let two frauds
steal it from them.

245
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:33,554
And if that means getting
my hands dirty, so be it.

246
00:10:33,623 --> 00:10:36,957
What's so funny?

247
00:10:37,026 --> 00:10:41,529
Just realized I've never
actually seen your hands dirty.

248
00:10:43,049 --> 00:10:45,983
All right, Hofstadter, here's
all the proof you need.

249
00:10:46,052 --> 00:10:47,818
- Great, thanks.
- Just remember,

250
00:10:47,887 --> 00:10:51,605
once you take this envelope,
there's no turning back.

251
00:10:51,674 --> 00:10:54,275
What if I look at it
and decide not to use it?

252
00:10:57,847 --> 00:10:59,780
I had not considered that.

253
00:11:00,883 --> 00:11:02,082
Got to hand it to you,

254
00:11:02,151 --> 00:11:03,962
you got a real talent
for making things boring.

255
00:11:03,986 --> 00:11:05,986
Thanks.

256
00:11:06,055 --> 00:11:08,189
Hey, look at that,
you did it again.

257
00:11:10,326 --> 00:11:11,459
Hi, Leonard.

258
00:11:11,527 --> 00:11:13,294
What? Nothing.

259
00:11:13,362 --> 00:11:15,196
You okay?

260
00:11:15,264 --> 00:11:16,564
Uh, no, you are.

261
00:11:22,994 --> 00:11:25,462
So guess what.
There was a waitress

262
00:11:25,463 --> 00:11:27,396
at The Cheesecake Factory
back in the day

263
00:11:27,465 --> 00:11:29,498
who kind of had a thing for me.

264
00:11:29,567 --> 00:11:33,135
Other than Bernadette?
That does not sound right.

265
00:11:33,204 --> 00:11:34,570
Honest to God.

266
00:11:34,639 --> 00:11:35,971
Oh, well, who was it?

267
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:37,518
It doesn't even matter.
I'm happily married.

268
00:11:37,542 --> 00:11:40,976
The point is women-- plural--
find me appealing.

269
00:11:41,045 --> 00:11:43,479
Okay. Okay, well,
well, let's see.

270
00:11:43,548 --> 00:11:45,648
Okay? We-we know
it wasn't Penny,

271
00:11:45,717 --> 00:11:47,983
we know it wasn't Susan...
- Wait.

272
00:11:48,052 --> 00:11:49,385
How do we know it wasn't Susan?

273
00:11:49,454 --> 00:11:51,153
Uh, because she had a type.

274
00:11:51,222 --> 00:11:52,421
What type?

275
00:11:52,490 --> 00:11:55,257
Don't make me say it.

276
00:11:55,326 --> 00:11:58,260
Are you saying
I'm not a handsome guy?

277
00:11:58,329 --> 00:12:01,030
See? It's mean, right?

278
00:12:03,401 --> 00:12:05,334
Hold on, as we've established,

279
00:12:05,403 --> 00:12:08,037
a minimum of two women
think I'm attractive.

280
00:12:08,106 --> 00:12:11,207
Uh, yeah, you're right,
it was totally Susan.

281
00:12:11,275 --> 00:12:14,076
I didn't say it was her.
I said it could've been.

282
00:12:14,145 --> 00:12:17,279
It could've been anybody.
Marta, Gina, Annalise...

283
00:12:17,348 --> 00:12:20,850
It's a little creepy that
you remember all their names.

284
00:12:20,918 --> 00:12:22,351
Not just their names.

285
00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:24,453
The cars they drove,
the color of their eyes,

286
00:12:24,522 --> 00:12:26,555
and whether or not
they had boyfriends.

287
00:12:29,293 --> 00:12:31,560
Your husband was acting
kind of weird today.

288
00:12:31,629 --> 00:12:34,930
You sure you're not thinking
about <i>your</i> husband?

289
00:12:34,966 --> 00:12:37,533
No. He was acting all sketchy.

290
00:12:37,602 --> 00:12:39,401
Almost like he was guilty
or something.

291
00:12:39,437 --> 00:12:40,877
Oh. Well,
that doesn't mean anything.

292
00:12:40,938 --> 00:12:43,873
I mean, Leonard has
resting guilt face.

293
00:12:43,941 --> 00:12:45,919
Yeah, it's-it's like, "What are
you guilty about, Leonard?"

294
00:12:45,943 --> 00:12:48,444
"Nothing." "Well, then,
tell it to your face."

295
00:12:48,513 --> 00:12:50,579
Are you okay?

296
00:12:50,648 --> 00:12:52,381
I'm so okay, yeah.

297
00:12:52,450 --> 00:12:54,617
Then why are <i>you</i>
acting guilty now?

298
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:57,520
Okay, look, Leonard knows

299
00:12:57,588 --> 00:12:59,989
that you and Sheldon
decided to take the high road,

300
00:13:00,057 --> 00:13:01,457
so he went to
Kripke for you.

301
00:13:01,526 --> 00:13:03,459
But that just means you
didn't do anything wrong,

302
00:13:03,528 --> 00:13:05,328
and now you don't risk
losing to those idiots.

303
00:13:05,396 --> 00:13:07,229
Why did you tell me?

304
00:13:07,298 --> 00:13:09,598
Now that I know, I'm implicated.

305
00:13:09,667 --> 00:13:10,833
But you wanted me to.

306
00:13:10,902 --> 00:13:13,002
I also wanted you
to be my jester

307
00:13:13,070 --> 00:13:15,471
at the Renaissance Fair,
but that didn't happen.

308
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:18,007
I wanted to be a princess.

309
00:13:18,075 --> 00:13:21,410
There was only one princess,
and it was me!

310
00:13:21,479 --> 00:13:24,580
Fine. I'm sorry I told you.

311
00:13:24,649 --> 00:13:26,549
And I forgive you.

312
00:13:26,617 --> 00:13:29,385
'Cause that's what
a princess would do.

313
00:13:30,822 --> 00:13:32,922
Kudos on the meatballs.

314
00:13:32,990 --> 00:13:34,924
They're nice and round.

315
00:13:36,727 --> 00:13:38,194
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

316
00:13:38,262 --> 00:13:40,196
They're much better
than those prolate spheroids

317
00:13:40,264 --> 00:13:42,698
you used to pass off as balls.

318
00:13:42,767 --> 00:13:44,433
Okay.

319
00:13:44,502 --> 00:13:47,303
Are you all right?
You seem distracted.

320
00:13:47,371 --> 00:13:50,940
Yeah, sorry. I'm just trying
to figure something out.

321
00:13:51,008 --> 00:13:52,808
Is it what to get me
for our anniversary?

322
00:13:52,877 --> 00:13:54,477
'Cause I'll give you
a hint: it's already

323
00:13:54,545 --> 00:13:57,980
in my Amazon basket.
Just click "buy now."

324
00:13:59,183 --> 00:14:00,549
I filled out
the gift card for you.

325
00:14:00,618 --> 00:14:03,786
Apparently,
I'm the light of your life.

326
00:14:03,855 --> 00:14:07,623
Sheldon, if someone
were gonna do something

327
00:14:07,692 --> 00:14:09,859
ethically murky on your behalf,

328
00:14:09,927 --> 00:14:11,694
would you rather
know about it

329
00:14:11,762 --> 00:14:14,997
or not know about it
to retain your innocence?

330
00:14:15,066 --> 00:14:19,134
Well, now that I know there's
a thing to know, I have to know.

331
00:14:19,203 --> 00:14:21,804
Can't help myself;
I'm a fact addict.

332
00:14:21,873 --> 00:14:23,539
That's not a real thing.

333
00:14:23,608 --> 00:14:25,774
And that's a fact.

334
00:14:27,144 --> 00:14:30,312
Leonard, I know
what you're planning to do,

335
00:14:30,381 --> 00:14:31,625
and I said
I didn't want to do it.

336
00:14:31,649 --> 00:14:32,815
What? You told him?

337
00:14:32,884 --> 00:14:34,250
Well, you told me.

338
00:14:34,318 --> 00:14:36,819
Yeah, that's-that's
probably where you heard it.

339
00:14:37,989 --> 00:14:39,588
You're not
doing anything wrong.

340
00:14:39,657 --> 00:14:41,357
That's the point.
I'm doing it.

341
00:14:41,425 --> 00:14:43,158
Yeah, but it's still wrong.

342
00:14:43,227 --> 00:14:44,894
Well, so is
you and Amy not getting

343
00:14:44,962 --> 00:14:46,328
the recognition
for your discovery.

344
00:14:46,397 --> 00:14:48,497
And if that means
I have to do something shady

345
00:14:48,566 --> 00:14:50,766
so you don't have to,
I'm okay with that.

346
00:14:50,835 --> 00:14:52,301
But we're not.

347
00:14:52,370 --> 00:14:55,204
I mean, it's sweet that you want
to help, but we don't want you

348
00:14:55,273 --> 00:14:57,373
compromising your integrity
for us.

349
00:14:57,441 --> 00:14:59,875
Wait, what-- really?

350
00:14:59,944 --> 00:15:02,211
I thought we were just
worried about looking bad.

351
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:04,346
It could be both.

352
00:15:04,415 --> 00:15:06,015
Okay.

353
00:15:06,083 --> 00:15:09,151
But I'm gonna go with my reason.
Yours is too complicated.

354
00:15:12,757 --> 00:15:14,223
Hey.

355
00:15:14,292 --> 00:15:15,524
Hey.

356
00:15:15,593 --> 00:15:19,128
Listen, I did something
kind of stupid today.

357
00:15:19,196 --> 00:15:21,397
Okay.

358
00:15:21,465 --> 00:15:23,065
I went to The Cheesecake Factory

359
00:15:23,134 --> 00:15:26,435
to try to figure out
who that waitress was.

360
00:15:26,504 --> 00:15:28,437
- Howie.
- Don't worry, I didn't find out,

361
00:15:28,506 --> 00:15:31,373
because I realized
I didn't even care.

362
00:15:31,442 --> 00:15:33,976
W-While I was there,
I started asking myself,

363
00:15:34,045 --> 00:15:35,878
"Why does this mean
anything to me?"

364
00:15:35,947 --> 00:15:41,617
And... I guess the truth is
it was all about my vanity.

365
00:15:41,686 --> 00:15:45,554
And why should I need to be
validated by another woman

366
00:15:45,623 --> 00:15:50,693
liking me when the best woman
in the world already loves me?

367
00:15:52,129 --> 00:15:54,630
And I just wanted
you to know that.

368
00:15:56,367 --> 00:15:57,847
The restaurant manager
already called.

369
00:15:57,902 --> 00:15:59,702
You really creeped
a lot of people out.

370
00:16:01,405 --> 00:16:04,940
And I regret that.

371
00:16:05,009 --> 00:16:07,710
Because the only woman
I want to creep out

372
00:16:07,778 --> 00:16:09,545
is the mother
of my children.

373
00:16:11,949 --> 00:16:14,583
Well, you're off
to a good start.

374
00:16:18,689 --> 00:16:20,522
Thank you for meeting us.

375
00:16:20,591 --> 00:16:21,690
No problem.

376
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:23,704
We never say no when someone
wants to buy us lunch.

377
00:16:23,728 --> 00:16:26,195
We didn't say we were
going to buy you lunch.

378
00:16:26,263 --> 00:16:28,197
Really? Apologies go down easier

379
00:16:28,265 --> 00:16:30,499
with free
turkey club sandwiches.

380
00:16:31,602 --> 00:16:34,470
This isn't another apology.

381
00:16:34,538 --> 00:16:35,983
There's something
we have to give you.

382
00:16:36,007 --> 00:16:37,606
Yes.

383
00:16:37,675 --> 00:16:41,977
Uh, we have proof that you
plagiarized your thesis.

384
00:16:42,046 --> 00:16:44,480
It's why we invited you
to this lunch.

385
00:16:44,548 --> 00:16:45,981
We invited them.

386
00:16:46,050 --> 00:16:49,551
That's the confusion
over who's paying.

387
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:51,520
Hold on, are you
blackmailing us?

388
00:16:51,589 --> 00:16:53,255
No, the opposite.

389
00:16:54,358 --> 00:16:56,358
We're blackmailing you?

390
00:16:59,530 --> 00:17:01,797
How are you
up for a Nobel?!

391
00:17:01,866 --> 00:17:03,665
We're giving you this

392
00:17:03,734 --> 00:17:05,834
so that no one can
use it against you,

393
00:17:05,903 --> 00:17:08,337
because we want to win
on our own merits,

394
00:17:08,406 --> 00:17:10,139
not by tearing you down.

395
00:17:10,207 --> 00:17:12,474
So it's true?
You really did this?

396
00:17:12,543 --> 00:17:13,854
It was years ago, and
I was going through

397
00:17:13,878 --> 00:17:15,811
a very hard time.
- What hard time?

398
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:18,847
I had to write a thesis, and
I wasn't smart enough to do it.

399
00:17:20,985 --> 00:17:23,285
You realize my name
is attached to yours.

400
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:25,254
If this gets out,
it ruins me, too.

401
00:17:25,322 --> 00:17:27,022
It's not gonna get out.

402
00:17:27,091 --> 00:17:28,435
You know what?
Linda was right.

403
00:17:28,459 --> 00:17:29,992
You're always
looking for shortcuts.

404
00:17:30,061 --> 00:17:33,028
When did you talk
to my ex-wife?

405
00:17:33,097 --> 00:17:34,097
She's not your ex-wife.

406
00:17:34,165 --> 00:17:35,442
You keep dragging your feet
on those papers.

407
00:17:35,466 --> 00:17:38,434
Well, I'm trying to
get the lake house.

408
00:17:38,502 --> 00:17:39,713
You're not getting
the lake house.

409
00:17:39,737 --> 00:17:41,670
You're never
getting the lake house.

410
00:17:41,739 --> 00:17:43,139
She picked it out,
she decorated it.

411
00:17:43,207 --> 00:17:44,740
The lake house is hers.

412
00:17:44,809 --> 00:17:46,508
What is going on here?

413
00:17:46,577 --> 00:17:48,877
I'm in love with Linda!

414
00:17:51,015 --> 00:17:53,549
You son of a bitch!

415
00:18:02,593 --> 00:18:05,027
That was my iced tea.

416
00:18:09,929 --> 00:18:11,729
Dr. Cooper, Dr. Fowler.

417
00:18:11,798 --> 00:18:13,798
Just the guy I want to see.

418
00:18:15,032 --> 00:18:16,389
Are you drunk?

419
00:18:16,390 --> 00:18:19,291
I was, and then I still was.

420
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:22,094
And now, I still was.

421
00:18:22,162 --> 00:18:24,830
Okay, can we help you?

422
00:18:24,898 --> 00:18:26,798
Pemberton is out.

423
00:18:26,867 --> 00:18:28,333
Someone published
all the information

424
00:18:28,402 --> 00:18:29,835
about his plagiarism.

425
00:18:29,903 --> 00:18:31,303
It was me.

426
00:18:32,911 --> 00:18:36,200
Someone else told Fermilab,
and he lost his job.

427
00:18:36,201 --> 00:18:37,634
Also me.

428
00:18:38,346 --> 00:18:39,243
And someone is

429
00:18:39,244 --> 00:18:43,212
sleeping with his ex-wife
and it's not me.

430
00:18:43,281 --> 00:18:45,481
I thought it was.

431
00:18:45,550 --> 00:18:48,017
Not anymore. Apparently,
just because I'm better

432
00:18:48,086 --> 00:18:51,153
than her husband doesn't mean
I'm as good as her contractor.

433
00:18:52,757 --> 00:18:55,024
Women, huh?

434
00:18:55,093 --> 00:18:56,492
I-I think you
need to go.

435
00:18:56,561 --> 00:18:58,561
No, wait.
Hear me out.

436
00:18:58,630 --> 00:19:00,229
Look, the three of us
could team up.

437
00:19:00,298 --> 00:19:01,364
There's one
small catch.

438
00:19:01,432 --> 00:19:03,132
Dr. Pemberton
has been saying

439
00:19:03,201 --> 00:19:04,934
a lot of bad stuff about me.

440
00:19:05,003 --> 00:19:07,470
But don't worry, I couldn't
possibly have done any of it,

441
00:19:07,505 --> 00:19:09,538
because I was with you guys
the whole time.

442
00:19:09,607 --> 00:19:10,873
I did it.

443
00:19:14,579 --> 00:19:16,278
Frankly,
I don't know what Linda

444
00:19:16,347 --> 00:19:17,813
ever saw in either of them.
