1
00:00:01,667 --> 00:00:03,600
Hello. I'm Dr. Sheldon Cooper.

2
00:00:03,669 --> 00:00:06,102
And I'm Dr. Amy Farrah Fowler.

3
00:00:06,171 --> 00:00:07,804
And this is:
Dr. Sheldon Cooper

4
00:00:07,873 --> 00:00:09,673
and Dr. Amy Farrah
Fowler present...

5
00:00:09,741 --> 00:00:14,010
<i>Dr. Sheldon Cooper's</i>
<i>Fun with Flags.</i>

6
00:00:14,079 --> 00:00:17,080
I'd like to start this episode
by apologizing on behalf

7
00:00:17,149 --> 00:00:19,549
of Dr. Fowler, who made
the wild claim last week

8
00:00:19,618 --> 00:00:21,418
that there was no national
tricolored flag

9
00:00:21,486 --> 00:00:23,486
with a purple stripe,
when, in fact,

10
00:00:23,555 --> 00:00:25,500
the Estonian governorate
inside the Russian Empire

11
00:00:25,524 --> 00:00:30,260
had a purple stripe on their
flag from 1721 to 1917.

12
00:00:32,297 --> 00:00:36,566
See? Right there
in the middle.

13
00:00:36,635 --> 00:00:39,603
And I'd like to apologize
on behalf of Dr. Cooper

14
00:00:39,671 --> 00:00:41,972
for having his zipper down
for the entire segment

15
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:45,542
on the flags of East Africa.

16
00:00:45,611 --> 00:00:49,346
Sorry, Tanzania,
you deserve better.

17
00:00:49,414 --> 00:00:51,414
All right, on today's episode,

18
00:00:51,483 --> 00:00:53,316
we're gonna start
with some viewer e-mails.

19
00:00:53,385 --> 00:00:55,151
Oh, take off your glasses
so people can't see

20
00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:56,553
your password in
the reflection.

21
00:00:56,622 --> 00:00:59,856
Oh, s-sure.

22
00:00:59,925 --> 00:01:03,560
Okay, our first e-mail
is-- mm-- from...

23
00:01:03,629 --> 00:01:06,129
uh, Brad or Brian?

24
00:01:06,198 --> 00:01:09,900
- I don't know, maybe it's Seth.
- All right, put them back on.

25
00:01:09,968 --> 00:01:14,938
Oh. Uh... oh, my gosh,
it's from Fermilab in Chicago.

26
00:01:15,007 --> 00:01:17,674
Ah. Not surprising,
the Windy City.

27
00:01:17,743 --> 00:01:20,243
Great flag town.

28
00:01:20,312 --> 00:01:22,245
No, no, it's about our paper.

29
00:01:22,314 --> 00:01:26,016
A team of physicists confirmed
super-asymmetry.

30
00:01:26,084 --> 00:01:28,418
Our paper was right.

31
00:01:28,487 --> 00:01:30,053
We did it.

32
00:01:30,122 --> 00:01:31,788
We did it?

33
00:01:31,857 --> 00:01:34,057
We did it.

34
00:01:34,126 --> 00:01:35,926
We did it.

35
00:01:35,994 --> 00:01:38,695
We did it!

36
00:01:38,764 --> 00:01:43,033
- We did it!
- We did it!

37
00:01:43,101 --> 00:01:45,643
Aw, remember when they only
did it on her birthday?

00:02:15,277 --> 00:02:18,946
So, my incredible wife
has some exciting news.

49
00:02:19,014 --> 00:02:20,948
Howie, stop.
I don't want to brag.

50
00:02:21,016 --> 00:02:23,250
Oh, okay, sorry.

51
00:02:30,426 --> 00:02:32,893
Really? No one's gonna ask?

52
00:02:32,962 --> 00:02:35,629
Sorry. What's your news?

53
00:02:35,698 --> 00:02:37,778
The drug I've been working on
for the past five years

54
00:02:37,833 --> 00:02:39,433
just got approved by the FDA.

55
00:02:39,501 --> 00:02:41,468
- Wow.
- Oh, congratulations.

56
00:02:41,537 --> 00:02:43,236
Was that the decongestant
you developed?

57
00:02:43,305 --> 00:02:46,573
No, we had to rebrand that as
a solvent for mining equipment.

58
00:02:48,444 --> 00:02:51,111
Is it that anti-itch cream you
were testing on grad students?

59
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:52,946
It's not, but that's
a really funny story

60
00:02:53,015 --> 00:02:55,482
which I'm legally prevented
from telling you.

61
00:02:56,719 --> 00:02:57,959
It's her
anti-inflammatory drug.

62
00:02:57,987 --> 00:02:59,252
Oh.

63
00:02:59,321 --> 00:03:01,366
Yep, three years of testing
and no reported side effects.

64
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:02,656
Ah, so it works.

65
00:03:02,725 --> 00:03:03,790
Eh.

66
00:03:05,894 --> 00:03:08,662
Well, congratulations.
I'm so happy for you.

67
00:03:08,731 --> 00:03:09,963
Yeah, well, I'm happy for you,

68
00:03:10,032 --> 00:03:11,765
because I want you
to head up my sales team.

69
00:03:11,834 --> 00:03:15,002
Really? Me? Don't you want
someone with more experience?

70
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:16,403
Nope. The job's all yours.

71
00:03:16,472 --> 00:03:17,704
Okay, well, thank you.

72
00:03:17,773 --> 00:03:19,413
Why don't we just chat
about this at work?

73
00:03:19,475 --> 00:03:22,476
We can chat about it all you
want, but you're doing it.

74
00:03:22,544 --> 00:03:25,045
We'll see.

75
00:03:25,114 --> 00:03:27,547
That's a yes.

76
00:03:27,616 --> 00:03:29,783
You guys will never believe
what just happened.

77
00:03:29,852 --> 00:03:31,118
Yeah, we heard.

78
00:03:31,186 --> 00:03:33,020
You did it.

79
00:03:33,088 --> 00:03:36,356
We did do it.

80
00:03:36,425 --> 00:03:39,359
And we didn't even
know we did it!

81
00:03:40,562 --> 00:03:42,496
Wait, what?

82
00:03:42,564 --> 00:03:46,366
Two physicists in Chicago
had to tell us.

83
00:03:47,736 --> 00:03:50,570
Wait, what?

84
00:03:50,639 --> 00:03:53,340
Their experiment on kaon decay
supported our predictions

85
00:03:53,409 --> 00:03:56,410
on the higher order corrections
pertaining to super-asymmetry.

86
00:03:56,478 --> 00:03:58,912
Wait, what?

87
00:04:00,315 --> 00:04:02,749
I am so proud of you.

88
00:04:02,818 --> 00:04:04,418
Well, I know how
to do the dishes.

89
00:04:04,486 --> 00:04:06,486
Just, sometimes
I'm tired.

90
00:04:09,258 --> 00:04:12,826
No, I-I mean, I'm proud of
how well you're doing at work.

91
00:04:12,895 --> 00:04:14,995
Are you even using soap?

92
00:04:15,064 --> 00:04:17,631
- Do you want to do this?
- Yeah, I really do.

93
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:19,633
You know, it was nice
of Bernadette to offer,

94
00:04:19,702 --> 00:04:22,002
but I'm not sure it's
the right move for me.

95
00:04:22,071 --> 00:04:23,314
Well, what are you
talking about?

96
00:04:23,338 --> 00:04:24,871
If you were in charge
of her project,

97
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:26,106
wouldn't that
be a promotion?

98
00:04:26,175 --> 00:04:28,135
Well, yeah, but it's not
the most important thing.

99
00:04:28,177 --> 00:04:29,854
Aren't you always saying
it's about the work,

100
00:04:29,878 --> 00:04:32,012
not more money
or a better title?

101
00:04:32,081 --> 00:04:35,482
All the smart things I say,
and you remember the dumb one.

102
00:04:35,551 --> 00:04:37,818
Plus, I'd be working
for Bernadette.

103
00:04:37,886 --> 00:04:39,453
I don't know
if that's a good idea.

104
00:04:39,521 --> 00:04:41,855
Look, I-I know she
can be difficult,

105
00:04:41,924 --> 00:04:43,557
but she's no match for you.

106
00:04:43,625 --> 00:04:46,493
Whatever she dishes out, you
can give it right back double.

107
00:04:46,562 --> 00:04:47,906
What the hell
is that supposed to mean?

108
00:04:47,930 --> 00:04:50,230
There you go.

109
00:04:53,068 --> 00:04:54,212
President Siebert,

110
00:04:54,236 --> 00:04:56,303
I have Dr. Cooper
and Dr. Fowler for you.

111
00:04:56,371 --> 00:04:58,138
Great.

112
00:04:58,207 --> 00:05:00,841
You two.

113
00:05:00,909 --> 00:05:03,510
Bring it in.

114
00:05:03,579 --> 00:05:05,345
What are
we bringing in?

115
00:05:05,414 --> 00:05:06,780
A hug.

116
00:05:06,849 --> 00:05:09,616
Oh. No, I don't want to.

117
00:05:09,685 --> 00:05:12,419
Well, what you don't want,
you don't get.

118
00:05:12,488 --> 00:05:14,955
Come on. Sit.

119
00:05:15,023 --> 00:05:17,491
I hope you know, with these
new data supporting your theory,

120
00:05:17,559 --> 00:05:20,227
we could be looking
at a Nobel-winning achievement.

121
00:05:20,295 --> 00:05:22,229
And by "we,"

122
00:05:22,297 --> 00:05:23,663
you mean "we,"

123
00:05:23,732 --> 00:05:25,866
not "we."

124
00:05:25,934 --> 00:05:28,335
"We," "we," whatever.

125
00:05:28,403 --> 00:05:29,703
Whee!

126
00:05:29,772 --> 00:05:32,072
Just a heads-up.

127
00:05:32,141 --> 00:05:36,910
Doctors Pemberton and Campbell
from Fermilab

128
00:05:36,979 --> 00:05:39,412
Confirming my theory,Angeles,
eager to meet me.

129
00:05:39,481 --> 00:05:41,915
They are checking
all my boxes.

130
00:05:41,984 --> 00:05:44,117
You know,
Caltech has 38 Nobel laureates.

131
00:05:44,186 --> 00:05:47,821
If you win, you and Amy
will be 39 and 40.

132
00:05:47,890 --> 00:05:50,590
Ooh! Dibs on 39.

133
00:05:50,659 --> 00:05:52,225
What's the difference?

134
00:05:52,294 --> 00:05:54,494
Wha... You are right,
there is no difference at all.

135
00:05:58,634 --> 00:06:01,201
Thank you. It is exciting.

136
00:06:01,270 --> 00:06:03,103
Oh, that's very sweet.

137
00:06:03,172 --> 00:06:04,571
I'm gonna remember
you said that.

138
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:06,940
Just like I remember how
you tried to take my office

139
00:06:07,009 --> 00:06:08,542
when I was on maternity leave.

140
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:12,479
Of course I'm not angry.

141
00:06:12,548 --> 00:06:14,481
Bye-bye.

142
00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:16,683
How can I be angry
at a dead man?

143
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:20,020
Hey, you got a sec?

144
00:06:20,088 --> 00:06:21,021
Sure. What's up?

145
00:06:21,089 --> 00:06:22,956
Uh, bad news.

146
00:06:23,025 --> 00:06:24,457
I spoke to my supervisor

147
00:06:24,526 --> 00:06:26,237
about heading up
your sales team, and she said

148
00:06:26,261 --> 00:06:27,661
she just can't
lose me right now.

149
00:06:27,729 --> 00:06:30,664
Do you want me to call her?
I could rip her a new one.

150
00:06:30,732 --> 00:06:32,532
No, no. No ripping.

151
00:06:32,601 --> 00:06:34,801
Um, anyway, I-I don't want
to leave her shorthanded,

152
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:35,969
so I'm sorry.

153
00:06:36,038 --> 00:06:37,871
I respect that.

154
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:39,573
That's what makes you
a good employee.

155
00:06:39,641 --> 00:06:40,674
Oh, thank you.

156
00:06:40,742 --> 00:06:42,142
It's just such a bummer.

157
00:06:42,211 --> 00:06:45,312
I know. Just, ugh!

158
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:47,581
You sure you don't want me
to call her?

159
00:06:47,649 --> 00:06:49,616
Oh, no, I'm sure, definitely
sure. Don't call her.

160
00:06:49,685 --> 00:06:52,352
But, you know, just, ugh, why?

161
00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:58,258
The last time we were in this
room, we were getting married.

162
00:06:58,327 --> 00:06:59,593
I remember.

163
00:06:59,661 --> 00:07:04,030
It's a lot less impressive
without Mark Hamill in it.

164
00:07:04,099 --> 00:07:05,832
That's what you said
about our honeymoon.

165
00:07:05,901 --> 00:07:08,134
And I stand by it.

166
00:07:08,203 --> 00:07:09,502
Doctors Cooper and Fowler,

167
00:07:09,571 --> 00:07:11,338
these are Doctors Pemberton
and Campbell,

168
00:07:11,406 --> 00:07:13,073
whose experiment
confirmed your work.

169
00:07:13,141 --> 00:07:15,475
- Hello. Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you. Hi.

170
00:07:18,981 --> 00:07:21,248
Okay, I'll leave you all to it.

171
00:07:21,316 --> 00:07:23,550
Remember about
the hugging.

172
00:07:25,587 --> 00:07:28,355
It is such a pleasure
to meet you.

173
00:07:28,423 --> 00:07:30,223
Oh, it's really nice
to meet you, too.

174
00:07:30,292 --> 00:07:32,192
I mean, we thought we'd
have to wait decades

175
00:07:32,261 --> 00:07:33,693
to get confirmation
for our theory.

176
00:07:33,762 --> 00:07:36,062
Yes, thanks to you,
I'll get to eat my Nobel dinner

177
00:07:36,131 --> 00:07:37,731
with my original teeth.

178
00:07:37,799 --> 00:07:40,734
Well, this certainly is a thrill
for us. Lunch with you two,

179
00:07:40,802 --> 00:07:43,303
and, uh, tomorrow, we're gonna
see a taping of <i>Ellen.</i>

180
00:07:44,339 --> 00:07:45,972
She's having John Stamos on.

181
00:07:46,041 --> 00:07:47,474
Uncle Jesse!

182
00:07:47,542 --> 00:07:50,110
Sounds fun.

183
00:07:50,178 --> 00:07:53,780
So, um, listen, we just
published a few months ago.

184
00:07:53,849 --> 00:07:56,283
How did you have time to
design an experiment?

185
00:07:56,351 --> 00:08:00,754
We didn't. This whole thing
is actually a gigantic accident.

186
00:08:00,822 --> 00:08:02,433
Yeah, we've been
working with kaons,

187
00:08:02,457 --> 00:08:04,557
and our data made
absolutely no sense.

188
00:08:04,626 --> 00:08:06,660
A few weeks ago, someone
told us about your paper,

189
00:08:06,728 --> 00:08:08,762
and we realized
that our failed experiment

190
00:08:08,830 --> 00:08:10,563
confirmed your theory.

191
00:08:10,632 --> 00:08:12,065
And now,
instead of losing our jobs,

192
00:08:12,134 --> 00:08:14,434
Fermilab flew us to L.A.
Economy Plus.

193
00:08:16,471 --> 00:08:18,438
Free headphones.

194
00:08:19,942 --> 00:08:22,442
Looks like my wife left me
a month too soon.

195
00:08:25,614 --> 00:08:29,482
So you weren't even
thinking about super-asymmetry?

196
00:08:29,551 --> 00:08:31,217
Thinking about it?

197
00:08:31,286 --> 00:08:33,253
We don't even
understand it.

198
00:08:33,322 --> 00:08:35,221
And now look at

199
00:08:35,290 --> 00:08:37,657
the four of us,
changing the face of physics!

200
00:08:37,726 --> 00:08:39,292
Ooh, I got to do it.

201
00:08:47,776 --> 00:08:51,377
Oh, man, that last episode of
<i>Star Trek: Discovery</i> was crazy.

202
00:08:51,446 --> 00:08:53,090
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
I-I'm actually one behind.

203
00:08:53,114 --> 00:08:54,781
I haven't started
the new season yet.

204
00:08:56,885 --> 00:08:58,296
Ooh, uh, how about
this week's <i>Walking Dead?</i>

205
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,419
Two behind.

206
00:08:59,487 --> 00:09:00,687
Three behind.

207
00:09:02,657 --> 00:09:04,123
- <i>Black Mirror?</i>
- No.

208
00:09:04,192 --> 00:09:05,792
No.

209
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:08,027
Come on, there must be
something we've all seen.

210
00:09:08,096 --> 00:09:10,363
Oh, how about that video
of my dog I sent you,

211
00:09:10,432 --> 00:09:13,266
where she's growling
at a pinecone?

212
00:09:13,335 --> 00:09:14,934
I actually hadn't
watched it yet,

213
00:09:15,003 --> 00:09:16,736
but thanks
for ruining the ending.

214
00:09:17,772 --> 00:09:19,339
Uh, can you believe this?

215
00:09:19,407 --> 00:09:22,041
Doctors Pemberton and Campbell
have been doing a press tour

216
00:09:22,110 --> 00:09:23,943
trying to take credit
for super-asymmetry.

217
00:09:24,012 --> 00:09:25,656
They didn't even know
what they were finding.

218
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:28,081
So what? I mean, no one's
gonna give them credit

219
00:09:28,149 --> 00:09:29,327
for accidentally
discovering something.

220
00:09:29,351 --> 00:09:31,417
Yeah, who remembers the guy

221
00:09:31,486 --> 00:09:34,253
who was trying to find India
and discovered America instead?

222
00:09:34,322 --> 00:09:35,955
What was his name again?

223
00:09:36,024 --> 00:09:38,891
But this is different.

224
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:41,060
Sheldon, super-asymmetry
is your paper.

225
00:09:41,129 --> 00:09:42,729
Everyone knows
you were there first.

226
00:09:42,797 --> 00:09:46,399
Mm, actually, the Nobel
Committee has sometimes favored

227
00:09:46,468 --> 00:09:49,702
experimentalists like them
over theoreticians like you.

228
00:09:49,771 --> 00:09:52,005
No, that's just
a scary campfire story

229
00:09:52,073 --> 00:09:53,606
like the guy with the hook.

230
00:09:55,710 --> 00:09:57,076
No, i-it's true.

231
00:09:57,145 --> 00:09:58,711
The scientists
that proved the big bang,

232
00:09:58,780 --> 00:10:01,481
they thought their sensors
needed cleaning

233
00:10:01,549 --> 00:10:03,783
until someone pointed out
that they were picking up

234
00:10:03,852 --> 00:10:06,452
cosmic background radiation
from the singularity.

235
00:10:06,521 --> 00:10:07,887
They won the Nobel.

236
00:10:07,956 --> 00:10:10,023
Not the scientists
that came up with the theory.

237
00:10:10,091 --> 00:10:12,925
So you're saying they could
steal our Nobel Prize?

238
00:10:12,994 --> 00:10:15,294
- Yes.
- That's terrible.

239
00:10:16,998 --> 00:10:18,097
Good news, though:

240
00:10:18,166 --> 00:10:20,066
Now we have something
we can talk about.

241
00:10:23,905 --> 00:10:25,271
Hey, you wanted
to see me?

242
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:27,206
- Yeah, come on in.
- Okay.

243
00:10:27,275 --> 00:10:28,941
Close the door.

244
00:10:29,010 --> 00:10:30,676
Okay.

245
00:10:33,648 --> 00:10:34,747
Have a seat.

246
00:10:34,816 --> 00:10:36,582
Do I have to?

247
00:10:36,651 --> 00:10:38,317
You really do.

248
00:10:41,122 --> 00:10:43,790
So, I talked
to your supervisor,

249
00:10:43,858 --> 00:10:46,125
and she said that she
never stopped you

250
00:10:46,194 --> 00:10:48,861
from working on my team,
because you never asked her.

251
00:10:48,930 --> 00:10:50,430
Really?

252
00:10:50,498 --> 00:10:51,931
Oh, you know, you should know,

253
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,766
she's been taking
our new antidepressant,

254
00:10:53,835 --> 00:10:57,003
and lying is one
of the main side effects.

255
00:10:57,072 --> 00:10:59,505
Why don't you want
to work with me?

256
00:10:59,574 --> 00:11:01,674
I know I can be tough,
but that's just 'cause

257
00:11:01,743 --> 00:11:04,143
I'm surrounded by
useless idiots.

258
00:11:04,212 --> 00:11:06,179
No, it's not that.

259
00:11:06,247 --> 00:11:07,513
Then why?

260
00:11:07,582 --> 00:11:10,183
Honestly, I don't know
if I'm up to it.

261
00:11:10,251 --> 00:11:12,018
You know,
the last project I managed

262
00:11:12,087 --> 00:11:14,187
was my high school yearbook.
- And?

263
00:11:14,255 --> 00:11:17,390
And that was the year
we didn't have one.

264
00:11:17,459 --> 00:11:19,003
Apparently, the printers
won't make them

265
00:11:19,027 --> 00:11:20,560
without getting paid.

266
00:11:20,628 --> 00:11:22,095
What happened to the money?

267
00:11:22,163 --> 00:11:24,964
Uh, if I didn't know then, I'm
not gonna magically know now.

268
00:11:25,033 --> 00:11:27,533
Plus, you know,
I didn't go to college.

269
00:11:27,602 --> 00:11:29,647
I'd be in charge of people
that are far more educated

270
00:11:29,671 --> 00:11:31,838
with more experience;
what if they don't listen to me?

271
00:11:31,906 --> 00:11:33,539
Then you be really mean to them.

272
00:11:33,608 --> 00:11:35,074
Have I taught you nothing?

273
00:11:36,344 --> 00:11:38,311
Penny, everybody
feels like you do.

274
00:11:38,379 --> 00:11:39,745
Like they're not good enough,

275
00:11:39,814 --> 00:11:41,614
not smart enough.
- What, even you?

276
00:11:41,683 --> 00:11:43,916
- Of course.
- Dr. Rostenkowski, you wanted me...

277
00:11:43,985 --> 00:11:46,452
Hey, did they not teach
knocking at Stanford? Get out!

278
00:11:49,357 --> 00:11:50,890
I love that kid.

279
00:11:55,430 --> 00:11:56,629
There you are.

280
00:11:56,698 --> 00:11:58,397
Dr. Cooper, hello.

281
00:11:58,466 --> 00:12:01,234
Hello to you, too. Now stop
trying to steal our Nobel Prize.

282
00:12:01,302 --> 00:12:02,668
You come up with your own idea.

283
00:12:02,737 --> 00:12:04,670
Yeah, that's not gonna happen.

284
00:12:05,807 --> 00:12:07,607
Wouldn't that
be something, though?

285
00:12:08,710 --> 00:12:09,738
Well, too bad.

286
00:12:09,739 --> 00:12:11,566
This discovery belongs
to Amy and me.

287
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:13,713
Look, Dr. Cooper,

288
00:12:13,781 --> 00:12:15,114
we all want a Nobel Prize.

289
00:12:15,183 --> 00:12:17,428
Super-asymmetry could be the
breakthrough that gets us there.

290
00:12:17,452 --> 00:12:20,153
But we can't fight over credit;
we have to work together.

291
00:12:20,221 --> 00:12:22,555
So...

292
00:12:22,624 --> 00:12:24,457
you're saying
that the four of us

293
00:12:24,526 --> 00:12:27,760
should just agree
to share this discovery?

294
00:12:27,829 --> 00:12:29,662
Well, no,
unfortunately,

295
00:12:29,731 --> 00:12:31,531
only three people
can share a Nobel.

296
00:12:31,599 --> 00:12:33,065
Oh, that's right.

297
00:12:35,370 --> 00:12:36,569
So he's out?

298
00:12:37,939 --> 00:12:39,972
No, I'm not out.

299
00:12:41,409 --> 00:12:43,809
So he's out?

300
00:12:43,878 --> 00:12:45,178
Neither of us is out.

301
00:12:45,246 --> 00:12:46,946
We think that
the three physicists

302
00:12:47,015 --> 00:12:49,682
should be the ones to win
the Nobel Prize for physics.

303
00:12:50,952 --> 00:12:52,785
Wait, so you want
to cut Amy out?

304
00:12:52,854 --> 00:12:54,353
No, of course not.

305
00:12:54,422 --> 00:12:56,489
We don't want to,
but we're going to.

306
00:12:57,759 --> 00:12:59,258
But she's my wife.

307
00:12:59,327 --> 00:13:01,060
Yes, exactly,
she's your wife.

308
00:13:01,129 --> 00:13:02,495
And she's a neuroscientist.

309
00:13:02,564 --> 00:13:05,198
It's like, what's she
even doing on this paper?

310
00:13:06,968 --> 00:13:10,036
It just raises questions.

311
00:13:10,104 --> 00:13:11,804
Look, Fermilab
is going to recommend

312
00:13:11,873 --> 00:13:13,439
the three of us
to the Nobel Committee.

313
00:13:13,508 --> 00:13:16,342
The best chance we have is if
your university does the same.

314
00:13:18,379 --> 00:13:20,379
I see.

315
00:13:21,883 --> 00:13:23,961
So you really think that
I'm the kind of man who would

316
00:13:23,985 --> 00:13:25,296
sell out his partner
for the chance

317
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:26,586
of winning a Nobel Prize?

318
00:13:26,654 --> 00:13:27,987
Are you?

319
00:13:29,023 --> 00:13:30,656
Boy, I hope not.

320
00:13:33,895 --> 00:13:35,461
I can't believe
Penny doesn't want

321
00:13:35,530 --> 00:13:37,797
to head up my sales team.
- That's too bad.

322
00:13:37,865 --> 00:13:40,099
But it's her decision,
not yours.

323
00:13:40,168 --> 00:13:42,368
Do you hear how dumb you sound?

324
00:13:43,538 --> 00:13:45,905
Why does this matter
to you so much?

325
00:13:45,974 --> 00:13:47,974
Because I believe in her,
and I make people better.

326
00:13:48,042 --> 00:13:49,175
It's what I do.

327
00:13:49,244 --> 00:13:50,509
Against their will?

328
00:13:50,578 --> 00:13:52,178
It's no fun if they want to.

329
00:13:52,247 --> 00:13:53,746
That's just called watching.

330
00:13:54,849 --> 00:13:56,249
Look at Howard.

331
00:13:56,317 --> 00:13:57,984
He was a disaster
when I met him.

332
00:13:58,052 --> 00:14:01,520
Now he's a foxy astronaut
with a hot wife.

333
00:14:01,589 --> 00:14:03,689
Wait, he always wanted
to be an astronaut.

334
00:14:03,758 --> 00:14:05,224
He thinks that, too.

335
00:14:05,293 --> 00:14:07,126
That's how good I am.

336
00:14:08,429 --> 00:14:09,795
Wait, so what
are you gonna do?

337
00:14:09,864 --> 00:14:11,297
Just badger her
until she says yes?

338
00:14:11,366 --> 00:14:14,700
Mm, that may have worked on you,
but she's too smart for that.

339
00:14:16,404 --> 00:14:18,315
Well, if you like fixing people,
I could use some help.

340
00:14:18,339 --> 00:14:19,872
Raj.

341
00:14:19,941 --> 00:14:22,275
Why do you think you stopped
wearing Crocs and socks?

342
00:14:22,343 --> 00:14:26,145
Uh, well, one day I just woke up
and realized they looked silly.

343
00:14:26,214 --> 00:14:28,614
Yes, you did.
All on your own.

344
00:14:30,251 --> 00:14:32,118
That's how good I am.

345
00:14:37,692 --> 00:14:39,492
What's wrong?

346
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:41,460
Why do you assume
something's wrong?

347
00:14:41,529 --> 00:14:43,396
Because you haven't
touched your dinner,

348
00:14:43,464 --> 00:14:47,199
and you're literally ticking
like a bomb about to go off.

349
00:14:47,268 --> 00:14:49,268
Oh, Amy.

350
00:14:49,337 --> 00:14:52,405
You see through me
like one of Penny's shirts.

351
00:14:53,975 --> 00:14:55,508
Just tell me.

352
00:14:57,912 --> 00:15:00,079
I talked to Doctors Pemberton
and Campbell today.

353
00:15:00,148 --> 00:15:03,849
They reminded me that only three
people can share a Nobel Prize.

354
00:15:03,918 --> 00:15:05,818
Their university
is recommending

355
00:15:05,887 --> 00:15:07,687
the two of them and me.

356
00:15:07,755 --> 00:15:09,755
And they want Caltech
to do the same.

357
00:15:12,393 --> 00:15:13,559
Oh.

358
00:15:13,628 --> 00:15:15,695
They say, if we present
a united front,

359
00:15:15,763 --> 00:15:17,830
we have a much better shot
at winning.

360
00:15:20,001 --> 00:15:21,667
Well, you know,

361
00:15:21,736 --> 00:15:23,035
that makes sense.

362
00:15:23,104 --> 00:15:25,338
Oh, but don't worry.
I won't do that to you.

363
00:15:29,143 --> 00:15:30,509
Maybe you should.

364
00:15:30,578 --> 00:15:32,111
What?

365
00:15:33,681 --> 00:15:35,881
This has been
your lifelong dream.

366
00:15:35,950 --> 00:15:38,751
And you may not get
another chance.

367
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:41,854
I don't want to be the reason
that you don't win a Nobel.

368
00:15:41,923 --> 00:15:45,291
You're the only
reason I deserve one.

369
00:15:48,763 --> 00:15:50,763
But if your best shot
is with them,

370
00:15:50,832 --> 00:15:52,331
I think you should take it.

371
00:15:54,135 --> 00:15:56,669
Is this really
what you want me to do?

372
00:15:57,972 --> 00:16:00,706
I just want you to be happy.

373
00:16:02,009 --> 00:16:03,209
Thank you.

374
00:16:13,154 --> 00:16:15,454
Hey. How long have you
been sitting there?

375
00:16:15,523 --> 00:16:16,963
Long enough for two
of your neighbors

376
00:16:17,024 --> 00:16:19,425
to ask if I was lost
and looking for my mother.

377
00:16:19,494 --> 00:16:21,927
I'm not changing my mind,
Bernie.

378
00:16:21,996 --> 00:16:23,562
That's okay. I'm sorry.

379
00:16:23,631 --> 00:16:26,198
It was wrong of me to badger you
into doing something

380
00:16:26,267 --> 00:16:27,600
that made you uncomfortable.

381
00:16:27,668 --> 00:16:28,601
Thank you.

382
00:16:28,669 --> 00:16:30,836
Mm, it's probably
for the best.

383
00:16:30,905 --> 00:16:32,638
I need someone
who's strong and confident

384
00:16:32,707 --> 00:16:35,408
to head up my sales team,
so I'm giving it to Karen.

385
00:16:35,476 --> 00:16:37,843
What... Karen?
Well, what's the job?

386
00:16:37,912 --> 00:16:41,347
Eating my yogurt and
then lying about it?

387
00:16:41,416 --> 00:16:42,848
I'm just saying.

388
00:16:42,917 --> 00:16:44,850
She went to college.
She's really smart.

389
00:16:44,919 --> 00:16:46,485
Well, I'm smarter than Karen.

390
00:16:46,554 --> 00:16:50,623
I can read the word "Penny"
on a cup of yogurt.

391
00:16:50,691 --> 00:16:51,957
Why are you getting so upset?

392
00:16:52,026 --> 00:16:53,959
I'm agreeing with you.
This is a big job,

393
00:16:54,028 --> 00:16:54,939
and I need someone
who's up to it.

394
00:16:54,940 --> 00:16:57,408
I am up to it.
I'm just nervous about it.

395
00:16:57,432 --> 00:16:58,832
I know.

396
00:16:58,833 --> 00:17:00,633
And that's why
I don't want to pressure you

397
00:17:00,701 --> 00:17:02,861
into doing something that you
clearly don't want to do.

398
00:17:02,904 --> 00:17:04,637
I know what you're up to.

399
00:17:04,705 --> 00:17:06,605
Is it working?

400
00:17:06,674 --> 00:17:08,407
Yes.

401
00:17:10,511 --> 00:17:14,180
- So I'll see you Monday morning?
-Yes.

402
00:17:14,248 --> 00:17:16,849
I bet I can make
that girl president.

403
00:17:20,755 --> 00:17:22,232
Uh, President Siebert,
Dr. Cooper is...

404
00:17:22,256 --> 00:17:24,190
I need to talk to
you about the paper

405
00:17:24,258 --> 00:17:26,492
that Dr. Fowler
and I published.

406
00:17:26,561 --> 00:17:28,494
Send him in.

407
00:17:28,563 --> 00:17:30,062
Amy and I did this together,

408
00:17:30,131 --> 00:17:32,031
and I will not
be part of an award

409
00:17:32,099 --> 00:17:34,077
that does not recognize
the value of her contributions.

410
00:17:34,101 --> 00:17:36,635
So you either include both of us
in the recommendation letter,

411
00:17:36,704 --> 00:17:38,170
or don't bother writing one.

412
00:17:38,239 --> 00:17:40,473
I hope you know
that's going to cause a fight

413
00:17:40,541 --> 00:17:42,341
between us
and the Fermilab team.

414
00:17:42,410 --> 00:17:44,743
If it's a fight that doesn't
involve any touching,

415
00:17:44,812 --> 00:17:46,979
risk of physical harm
or uncomfortable eye contact

416
00:17:47,048 --> 00:17:48,959
'cause it's happening online
or through intermediaries,

417
00:17:48,983 --> 00:17:50,749
I say bring it.

418
00:17:50,818 --> 00:17:53,185
All right.
I respect your decision.

419
00:17:53,254 --> 00:17:55,254
You do?

420
00:17:55,323 --> 00:17:57,890
Yes. You and Dr. Fowler
have my full support.

421
00:17:57,959 --> 00:18:00,025
Oh, okay.

422
00:18:00,094 --> 00:18:02,595
I anticipated
a little more pushback.

423
00:18:02,663 --> 00:18:04,997
Sorry, my job here
is to serve your needs,

424
00:18:05,066 --> 00:18:06,499
both academic and personal.

425
00:18:06,567 --> 00:18:09,134
Huh.

426
00:18:09,203 --> 00:18:11,114
Well, now I'm filled with
all this nervous energy.

427
00:18:11,138 --> 00:18:13,072
I don't know quite
what to do with it.

428
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:15,241
We have a fully equipped
gymnasium.

429
00:18:15,309 --> 00:18:16,976
Yeah... Really?

430
00:18:17,044 --> 00:18:19,078
Where's that?

431
00:18:19,146 --> 00:18:20,713
It's part of the new
sports complex.

432
00:18:20,781 --> 00:18:22,681
Oh.

433
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:24,450
And where is that?

434
00:18:24,519 --> 00:18:26,051
Come on, I'll show you.

435
00:18:28,589 --> 00:18:30,222
Are there monkey bars?

436
00:18:35,702 --> 00:18:37,301
All right, now,
I'm sure some of you

437
00:18:37,370 --> 00:18:38,681
are wondering,
"Who is this woman?

438
00:18:38,705 --> 00:18:41,439
"How did she get to be
in charge of the sales team?

439
00:18:41,507 --> 00:18:44,241
Is it because she's friends
with Dr. Rostenkowski?"

440
00:18:44,310 --> 00:18:46,644
Because she is.

441
00:18:46,713 --> 00:18:49,180
"Is it because she was
Miss Cornhusker 2001

442
00:18:49,248 --> 00:18:51,515
and still fits
in those very same jeans?"

443
00:18:51,584 --> 00:18:53,150
'Cause she was, and she does,

444
00:18:53,219 --> 00:18:54,752
and they're actually
a little baggy.

445
00:18:56,489 --> 00:18:58,956
Or is it because she's
the best damn salesperson here?

446
00:18:59,025 --> 00:19:00,324
Because I am.

447
00:19:00,393 --> 00:19:03,961
Now that we're clear on that,
here are the drug specs

448
00:19:04,030 --> 00:19:05,730
and marketing strategy
for Inflamminex.

449
00:19:05,798 --> 00:19:09,300
Which, now that I say it out
loud, might be a placeholder.

450
00:19:09,368 --> 00:19:11,969
By tomorrow, I want everyone to
have this committed to memory.

451
00:19:12,038 --> 00:19:13,971
Do you have it
committed to memory?

452
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:16,006
You want to have
a contest, Karen?

453
00:19:16,075 --> 00:19:18,075
Winner gets a yogurt.

454
00:19:19,345 --> 00:19:20,845
No, boss.

455
00:19:20,913 --> 00:19:23,214
All right, now we all know
what we need to do.

456
00:19:23,282 --> 00:19:24,448
Let's go do it.

457
00:19:25,518 --> 00:19:28,385
R-Right now.
Get out of here. Go.

458
00:19:30,423 --> 00:19:32,289
That was
really impressive.

459
00:19:32,358 --> 00:19:33,791
Damn right it
was impressive.

460
00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:36,460
- Okay, that tone doesn't work with me.
- Sorry, boss.
