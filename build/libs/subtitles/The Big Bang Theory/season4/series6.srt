1
00:00:05,706 --> 00:00:06,839
Problem?

2
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:09,241
This is the worst cobbler
I've ever eaten.

3
00:00:09,242 --> 00:00:13,412
It tastes like it's made of
actual ground-up shoemaker.

4
00:00:13,413 --> 00:00:16,983
Amusing. A play on the
two meanings of "cobbler."

5
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:22,221
Hey, guys. Guess who
I found at LAX?

6
00:00:22,222 --> 00:00:23,556
My baby sister Priya.

7
00:00:23,557 --> 00:00:25,725
Excuse me, I object.

8
00:00:25,726 --> 00:00:27,927
You propose a guessing game,

9
00:00:27,928 --> 00:00:29,895
yet you don't give me
enough time to guess.

10
00:00:29,896 --> 00:00:32,531
For the record,
I was going to say:

11
00:00:32,532 --> 00:00:33,799
"Your sister Priya."

12
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:37,370
Oh, Sheldon. You haven't
changed a bit, have you?

13
00:00:37,371 --> 00:00:39,472
Why would I change?

14
00:00:39,473 --> 00:00:40,639
The hope has been that

15
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:42,708
you'd eventually bend
to public opinion.

16
00:00:42,709 --> 00:00:45,845
So, Priya, what brings
you back to L.A.?

17
00:00:45,846 --> 00:00:47,980
I have a one-day layover
on my way to Toronto.

18
00:00:47,981 --> 00:00:49,382
Corporate merger.

19
00:00:49,383 --> 00:00:50,483
Can you believe it?

20
00:00:50,484 --> 00:00:51,851
Little Priya's one
of the lead attorneys

21
00:00:51,852 --> 00:00:53,285
for the biggest
car company in India.

22
00:00:53,286 --> 00:00:56,322
Given that when we met her,
she was finishing law school

23
00:00:56,323 --> 00:00:59,692
and planning an internship
at a large Indian car company,

24
00:00:59,693 --> 00:01:01,594
it's actually
extremely plausible.

25
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:05,064
And your poll numbers
just keep dropping.

26
00:01:05,832 --> 00:01:07,366
I want to catch up
with all of you,

27
00:01:07,367 --> 00:01:09,101
but first I really
must visit the loo.

28
00:01:09,102 --> 00:01:11,270
I'm going, too; I'll
show you where it is.

29
00:01:12,072 --> 00:01:13,539
All right, this goes
without saying,

30
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:15,241
but I'm just going
to say it anyway.

31
00:01:15,242 --> 00:01:17,510
Hands off my sister.

32
00:01:17,511 --> 00:01:21,347
Why would I touch her? She's
covered with airplane germs.

33
00:01:21,348 --> 00:01:24,984
I'm so not talking to you.
I'm talking to him.

34
00:01:24,985 --> 00:01:28,671
Hey. I've got a girlfriend now.
Oh, please.

35
00:01:28,672 --> 00:01:29,789
My sister's much hotter

36
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:31,757
than your girlfriend,
and you know it.

37
00:01:31,758 --> 00:01:33,492
Let's just agree
they're both hot.

38
00:01:33,493 --> 00:01:36,862
But dude, that's my sister
you're talking about!

39
00:01:36,863 --> 00:01:38,631
Okay, forget who's hotter.

40
00:01:38,632 --> 00:01:41,667
The first time Priya came to
L.A., Leonard and I made a pact

41
00:01:41,668 --> 00:01:44,370
out of respect to our
friendship and to you

42
00:01:44,371 --> 00:01:46,472
that neither of us
would hit on her.

43
00:01:46,473 --> 00:01:48,107
Did you pinky-swear?

44
00:01:50,811 --> 00:01:52,578
Yes.

45
00:01:53,647 --> 00:01:55,314
Okay, then.

46
00:01:55,315 --> 00:01:58,451
Cobbler. I'm still laughing.

47
00:01:59,486 --> 00:02:01,821
It's really nice
to see you again, Leonard.

48
00:02:01,822 --> 00:02:03,923
Yeah. It's good
to see you, too.

49
00:02:03,924 --> 00:02:04,924
Here you go.

50
00:02:04,925 --> 00:02:06,075
Thanks.

51
00:02:09,546 --> 00:02:10,963
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

52
00:02:13,233 --> 00:02:15,134
Okay.

53
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:18,754
? Our whole universe
was in a hot, dense state ?

54
00:02:18,755 --> 00:02:22,091
? Then nearly 14 billion years
ago expansion started... Wait! ?

55
00:02:22,092 --> 00:02:23,742
? The Earth began to cool ?

56
00:02:23,743 --> 00:02:26,262
? The autotrophs began to drool,
Neanderthals developed tools ?

57
00:02:26,263 --> 00:02:28,948
? We built the Wall ?
? <i>We built the pyramids</i> ?

58
00:02:28,949 --> 00:02:31,617
? Math, Science, History,
unraveling the mystery ?

59
00:02:31,618 --> 00:02:33,519
? That all started
with a big bang ?

60
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:34,389
? <i>Bang!</i> ?

61
00:02:34,589 --> 00:02:37,089

63
00:02:39,466 --> 00:02:41,985
So you got any special plans
with your sister?

64
00:02:42,025 --> 00:02:44,426
Oh, not really. Just hang out.

65
00:02:44,427 --> 00:02:47,095
I always tell people,
"If you have only one day

66
00:02:47,096 --> 00:02:50,666
in Los Angeles,
make it a train day."

67
00:02:50,667 --> 00:02:52,467
Train day?

68
00:02:52,468 --> 00:02:55,838
The fun starts with brunch
at Carney's in Studio City,

69
00:02:55,839 --> 00:02:58,974
a hotdog stand in a
converted railroad dining car.

70
00:02:58,975 --> 00:03:00,108
Next stop, Travel Town,

71
00:03:00,109 --> 00:03:04,413
an outdoor museum featuring
43 railroad engines,

72
00:03:04,414 --> 00:03:08,016
cars, and other rolling stock
from the 1880s to the 1930s.

73
00:03:08,017 --> 00:03:11,970
And, finally, we're off to the
glitz and glamour of Hollywood,

74
00:03:11,971 --> 00:03:15,891
for dinner at--that's right--
the Hollywood Carney's,

75
00:03:15,892 --> 00:03:20,762
a hotdog stand in a <i>different</i>
converted railroad dining car.

76
00:03:20,763 --> 00:03:23,866
I don't think
we're going to do that.

77
00:03:23,867 --> 00:03:27,302
Well, then apparently
you hate fun.

78
00:03:31,641 --> 00:03:33,742
Priya's not back yet?

79
00:03:33,743 --> 00:03:35,193
Well, I guess
that's not unusual.

80
00:03:35,194 --> 00:03:37,613
Women, men, the whole
sitting-standing deal.

81
00:03:37,614 --> 00:03:39,081
So what are we talking about?

82
00:03:39,082 --> 00:03:40,749
Uh, my plans
with Priya.

83
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:42,718
He rejected Train Day.

84
00:03:42,719 --> 00:03:45,287
Did you make it clear that
it's two different train cars

85
00:03:45,288 --> 00:03:47,155
turned into hotdog stands?

86
00:03:47,156 --> 00:03:48,891
Abundantly.

87
00:03:48,892 --> 00:03:50,792
I guess he just hates fun.

88
00:03:50,793 --> 00:03:54,229
That's what I said!

89
00:03:56,716 --> 00:03:59,034
Okay, so... what's
new with you guys?

90
00:03:59,035 --> 00:04:00,469
I have a girlfriend now.

91
00:04:00,470 --> 00:04:01,837
Hey, good for you!

92
00:04:01,838 --> 00:04:03,505
Yeah, I just want
to put it out there

93
00:04:03,506 --> 00:04:04,573
in case I inadvertently

94
00:04:04,574 --> 00:04:07,342
squirt any pheromones
in your direction.

95
00:04:08,111 --> 00:04:09,278
Happy?

96
00:04:11,447 --> 00:04:13,916
So, Priya, what are your
plans while you're here?

97
00:04:13,917 --> 00:04:15,918
I don't know. I just
have the one day.

98
00:04:15,919 --> 00:04:19,121
Do you like trains?

99
00:04:19,122 --> 00:04:20,589
Not particularly.

100
00:04:23,559 --> 00:04:27,746
You might as well just wait
at the airport for your flight.

101
00:04:28,915 --> 00:04:30,949
"You are in a forest.

102
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:32,618
"There is quicksand to the west,

103
00:04:32,619 --> 00:04:37,272
a path leads to the east."

104
00:04:37,273 --> 00:04:39,975
Go east.

105
00:04:39,976 --> 00:04:43,912
"An iron gate blocks your way."

106
00:04:43,913 --> 00:04:46,648
Open gate.

107
00:04:46,649 --> 00:04:48,150
"It's locked."

108
00:04:48,151 --> 00:04:50,319
Hmm.

109
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:52,487
Well, so much for that.

110
00:04:55,024 --> 00:04:56,892
It's getting pretty late.
How come you're still up?

111
00:04:56,893 --> 00:05:00,929
I found an emulator online that
lets you play classic text-based

112
00:05:00,930 --> 00:05:03,398
computer games from the 1980s.

113
00:05:03,399 --> 00:05:04,833
That's pretty cool.

114
00:05:04,834 --> 00:05:08,236
Oh, yes. It runs on the world's
most powerful graphics chip:

115
00:05:08,237 --> 00:05:10,505
imagination.

116
00:05:10,506 --> 00:05:13,308
You've really got
to get out more.

117
00:05:15,211 --> 00:05:17,346
Go north.

118
00:05:17,347 --> 00:05:19,514
"You can't go that way."

119
00:05:19,515 --> 00:05:21,249
Go west.

120
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:23,652
"A troll blocks your passage."

121
00:05:23,653 --> 00:05:25,954
Okay. Fasten your seatbelts.

122
00:05:27,357 --> 00:05:29,591
Kill troll.

123
00:05:29,592 --> 00:05:31,226
"With what?"

124
00:05:31,227 --> 00:05:33,328
With sword.

125
00:05:34,330 --> 00:05:35,897
"You don't have the sword."

126
00:05:35,898 --> 00:05:38,967
Good golly, it's as if
it's actually happening to me.

127
00:05:40,936 --> 00:05:42,571
Raj finally went to bed.

128
00:05:45,541 --> 00:05:47,976
Sheldon's still up.

129
00:05:47,977 --> 00:05:49,745
You said he goes
to bed at 9:00.

130
00:05:49,746 --> 00:05:52,447
Yeah, he does, but he got caught
up in a computer game and...

131
00:05:52,448 --> 00:05:55,183
Hit troll with axe!

132
00:05:55,184 --> 00:05:58,553
Hit troll with axe!

133
00:05:58,554 --> 00:06:01,223
Hit troll with axe!

134
00:06:01,224 --> 00:06:03,625
My, this is one tough troll.

135
00:06:03,626 --> 00:06:05,293
Can't you get rid of him?

136
00:06:05,294 --> 00:06:08,096
If the past is any
indication, no.

137
00:06:08,097 --> 00:06:10,265
Leonard, I'm trapped
in quicksand!

138
00:06:10,266 --> 00:06:13,101
The axe is dragging me down!

139
00:06:13,102 --> 00:06:14,202
Drop axe!

140
00:06:14,203 --> 00:06:16,738
Drop axe, brilliant!

141
00:06:17,673 --> 00:06:21,076
Give me a minute.

142
00:06:22,545 --> 00:06:23,528
Sheldon.

143
00:06:23,529 --> 00:06:24,579
Hold on.

144
00:06:24,580 --> 00:06:25,580
Trying to figure out

145
00:06:25,581 --> 00:06:26,581
how to get the bucket,

146
00:06:26,582 --> 00:06:29,051
so I can carry the mud
past the dragon.

147
00:06:29,052 --> 00:06:31,386
Sheldon, you need to
work in the morning.

148
00:06:31,387 --> 00:06:32,387
I know!

149
00:06:32,388 --> 00:06:33,388
Well, then bed, mister!

150
00:06:33,389 --> 00:06:35,724
Five more minutes!

151
00:06:35,725 --> 00:06:37,125
Really?

152
00:06:37,126 --> 00:06:39,361
You're going to risk getting
sleepy in the middle of your

153
00:06:39,362 --> 00:06:40,629
thermodynamic
fluctuations seminar?

154
00:06:40,630 --> 00:06:43,014
You know what happens
when you yawn in public.

155
00:06:46,736 --> 00:06:50,439
Everyone will see
my oddly shaped uvula.

156
00:06:51,974 --> 00:06:53,475
You don't want that, do you?

157
00:06:54,343 --> 00:06:56,695
No.

158
00:06:56,696 --> 00:07:01,550
But it's a shame our society
mocks the differently uvulated.

159
00:07:03,035 --> 00:07:04,086
Who was at the door?

160
00:07:04,087 --> 00:07:06,088
Uh, building manager.

161
00:07:06,089 --> 00:07:07,956
They have to fix a pipe,

162
00:07:07,957 --> 00:07:10,625
so the water'll be off
tomorrow from noon to 2:00.

163
00:07:10,626 --> 00:07:12,160
That's unacceptable.

164
00:07:12,161 --> 00:07:13,578
We're supposed to be
given written notice.

165
00:07:13,579 --> 00:07:15,380
Well, no, it doesn't matter--
we'll be at work.

166
00:07:15,381 --> 00:07:18,266
What if I spill tomato
soup on my shirt,

167
00:07:18,267 --> 00:07:19,634
and have to come home to change,

168
00:07:19,635 --> 00:07:22,003
only to find there's no water
for an enzyme soak?

169
00:07:22,004 --> 00:07:24,106
Bifurcated uvula, Sheldon!

170
00:07:24,107 --> 00:07:27,008
I'll have the chicken noodle.
Good night!

171
00:07:31,264 --> 00:07:33,565
We're going
to have to be very quiet.

172
00:07:38,154 --> 00:07:40,255
I know how to
get the bucket!

173
00:07:40,256 --> 00:07:42,223
I can turn the axe around

174
00:07:42,224 --> 00:07:44,743
and use the handle to reach it.

175
00:07:44,744 --> 00:07:46,728
Let's see.

176
00:07:46,729 --> 00:07:49,164
Go north.

177
00:07:49,165 --> 00:07:50,749
"You are in a forest."

178
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:52,467
Go north.

179
00:07:52,468 --> 00:07:53,902
"You are in a forest."

180
00:07:53,903 --> 00:07:55,337
Go north.

181
00:07:55,338 --> 00:07:58,006
"You are in a forest."
Oh dear, I believe I'm lost.

182
00:07:58,007 --> 00:08:00,074
Well, I'll just have to get
a fresh start tomorrow.

183
00:08:00,075 --> 00:08:01,960
No, no, no! You just
took a wrong turn.

184
00:08:01,961 --> 00:08:03,445
You just need to map it out.

185
00:08:03,446 --> 00:08:04,446
Come on, I'll help you.

186
00:08:04,447 --> 00:08:05,914
So you stopped at the stream,

187
00:08:05,915 --> 00:08:07,632
and you turned
north three times?

188
00:08:07,633 --> 00:08:08,783
Yes.

189
00:08:08,784 --> 00:08:10,385
You're right.
You're lost. Good luck.

190
00:08:16,993 --> 00:08:17,976
Oh!

191
00:08:17,977 --> 00:08:19,027
Leonard. Wake up.

192
00:08:19,028 --> 00:08:20,028
Huh? Wh-- Sorry.

193
00:08:20,029 --> 00:08:21,563
For what?

194
00:08:21,564 --> 00:08:23,999
I don't know. When I'm in bed
with a girl, it's just--

195
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,901
it's my go-to response.

196
00:08:25,902 --> 00:08:27,903
It's 6:00. I have
to get back to Raj's

197
00:08:27,904 --> 00:08:29,738
before he wakes up
and realizes I'm gone.

198
00:08:29,739 --> 00:08:32,090
Oh. Right. Sure.

199
00:08:32,091 --> 00:08:34,626
I wish you could stay
in L.A. a while longer.

200
00:08:34,627 --> 00:08:35,644
Mmm, me, too.

201
00:08:35,645 --> 00:08:37,162
You know, I was thinking:

202
00:08:37,163 --> 00:08:40,081
There are some great
research facilities in India.

203
00:08:40,082 --> 00:08:42,884
Where are you going
with this, Leonard?

204
00:08:42,885 --> 00:08:46,638
Well, I'm just saying, you know,
I don't have any real ties here,

205
00:08:46,639 --> 00:08:49,858
so if I were to move to New
Delhi, we could, you know--

206
00:08:49,859 --> 00:08:52,727
go out.

207
00:08:52,728 --> 00:08:56,364
Leonard, didn't we have this
conversation five years ago?

208
00:08:56,365 --> 00:08:57,332
Well, yes, but...

209
00:08:57,333 --> 00:08:58,567
things have changed.

210
00:08:58,568 --> 00:09:00,168
You know, you're older,
I'm older--

211
00:09:00,169 --> 00:09:02,354
Look, no more
superhero bed sheets.

212
00:09:02,355 --> 00:09:03,822
Sweetheart,

213
00:09:03,823 --> 00:09:06,825
just because we have fun when
I come to town doesn't mean

214
00:09:06,826 --> 00:09:09,444
I want to have a
serious relationship.

215
00:09:09,445 --> 00:09:10,412
It doesn't?

216
00:09:10,413 --> 00:09:11,813
Mm-mm.

217
00:09:11,814 --> 00:09:15,083
And besides, I could never bring
a white boy home to my parents.

218
00:09:15,985 --> 00:09:17,152
They'd have a cow.

219
00:09:17,153 --> 00:09:19,788
Which is a much
bigger deal in India.

220
00:09:19,789 --> 00:09:22,224
I'm not that white.

221
00:09:22,225 --> 00:09:24,292
My great-great-grandmother
was half Cherokee.

222
00:09:24,293 --> 00:09:27,362
I know that's not the right kind
of Indian, but it is something.

223
00:09:27,363 --> 00:09:29,064
You're funny.

224
00:09:29,065 --> 00:09:30,398
Leonard?

225
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:31,566
Leonard?

226
00:09:31,567 --> 00:09:33,051
Leonard?

227
00:09:33,936 --> 00:09:34,936
What?

228
00:09:34,937 --> 00:09:36,538
I heard a woman laughing.

229
00:09:36,539 --> 00:09:40,942
Oh, uh, yeah. I was trying to
see if I could laugh as a woman.

230
00:09:42,912 --> 00:09:45,580
Oh! Well, good job.
Quite convincing.

231
00:09:46,282 --> 00:09:48,049
I smell perfume.

232
00:09:48,050 --> 00:09:49,117
Air freshener.

233
00:09:49,118 --> 00:09:52,687
And is that lipstick
on your cheek and neck?

234
00:09:52,688 --> 00:09:54,022
Rash. That's a bad rash.

235
00:09:54,023 --> 00:09:55,624
My sympathies.

236
00:09:55,625 --> 00:09:59,127
I'm no stranger to the crimson
scourge that is dermatitis.

237
00:10:00,429 --> 00:10:03,131
Can I interest you
in a topical steroid

238
00:10:03,132 --> 00:10:05,100
from my lotion and
unguent collection?

239
00:10:05,101 --> 00:10:08,103
Uh, yeah, yeah,
that sounds great.

240
00:10:08,104 --> 00:10:10,272
Very well. I'm sure
I can find something

241
00:10:10,273 --> 00:10:12,007
that will help
you ditch that itch.

242
00:10:13,743 --> 00:10:16,144
Okay, he's in the
bathroom. Let's go.

243
00:10:19,148 --> 00:10:21,816
Do you prefer
ointment or cream?

244
00:10:24,153 --> 00:10:25,220
Cream.

245
00:10:25,221 --> 00:10:26,554
With or without a numbing agent?

246
00:10:26,555 --> 00:10:27,555
Without.

247
00:10:27,556 --> 00:10:28,957
Really, Leonard?

248
00:10:28,958 --> 00:10:31,626
There are no heroes when
it comes to dermatitis.

249
00:10:31,627 --> 00:10:33,728
Fine. With.

250
00:10:33,729 --> 00:10:35,563
Prescription or
non-prescription strength?

251
00:10:35,564 --> 00:10:36,998
Use your best judgment.

252
00:10:36,999 --> 00:10:41,770
Well, I think I have a
nice 2009 AnaMantle HC.

253
00:10:41,771 --> 00:10:45,173
It's usually indicated for
acutely inflamed hemorrhoids,

254
00:10:45,174 --> 00:10:49,544
but it also goes nicely
with non-mucosal body parts.

255
00:10:50,413 --> 00:10:51,579
Sounds great.

256
00:10:51,580 --> 00:10:53,214
Excellent choice.

257
00:10:54,934 --> 00:10:57,585
Okay, hurry, hurry, hurry.

258
00:10:58,454 --> 00:11:00,605
Come on, come on, come on.

259
00:11:01,524 --> 00:11:03,758
Priya?

260
00:11:04,527 --> 00:11:06,328
Good morning, Sheldon.

261
00:11:06,329 --> 00:11:10,832
For shame, Leonard, for shame.

262
00:11:10,833 --> 00:11:13,001
And to think,

263
00:11:13,002 --> 00:11:15,153
I was ready to waste

264
00:11:15,154 --> 00:11:19,174
the last of my good
hemorrhoid cream on you.

265
00:11:24,357 --> 00:11:27,076
Making pretty
good time, huh?

266
00:11:27,152 --> 00:11:30,588
Is that really what you want
to talk about, Leonard?

267
00:11:30,589 --> 00:11:32,040
No.

268
00:11:32,041 --> 00:11:33,458
What do you want to talk about?

269
00:11:33,459 --> 00:11:34,609
Please don't tell anyone

270
00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:36,077
I spent the night
with Raj's sister.

271
00:11:36,078 --> 00:11:38,079
There it is.

272
00:11:39,048 --> 00:11:40,948
What if someone asks?

273
00:11:40,949 --> 00:11:43,551
No one's going to ask if I spent
the night with Raj's sister.

274
00:11:43,552 --> 00:11:47,655
Perhaps, but they might ask me
something else.

275
00:11:47,656 --> 00:11:48,990
Like what?
Like

276
00:11:48,991 --> 00:11:53,511
"Has Leonard betrayed any
of his friends recently?"

277
00:11:53,512 --> 00:11:55,663
Priya and I are both adults.

278
00:11:55,664 --> 00:11:57,365
I didn't betray Raj.

279
00:11:57,366 --> 00:12:00,935
In fact, you did,
but I was referring to Howard.

280
00:12:00,936 --> 00:12:02,003
What are you talking about?

281
00:12:02,004 --> 00:12:03,988
April 12, 2005.

282
00:12:03,989 --> 00:12:06,074
Bob's Big Boy,
Toluca Lake.

283
00:12:06,075 --> 00:12:09,677
Raj had just introduced us
to Priya for the first time.

284
00:12:09,678 --> 00:12:12,814
She was enjoying the sweet taste
of Hindu rebellion

285
00:12:12,815 --> 00:12:15,583
in the form of a Bob's
Super Big Boy hamburger.

286
00:12:15,584 --> 00:12:16,851
In order
to preserve

287
00:12:16,852 --> 00:12:20,054
your friendship, you and Howard
made a pinky swear

288
00:12:20,055 --> 00:12:21,890
that neither of you
would attempt to woo her.

289
00:12:22,875 --> 00:12:25,593
I had a patty melt.

290
00:12:25,594 --> 00:12:27,462
Okay, fine, I betrayed Howard.

291
00:12:27,463 --> 00:12:29,397
And Raj.
All right, and Raj.

292
00:12:29,398 --> 00:12:31,049
And me.

293
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:32,800
You?

294
00:12:32,801 --> 00:12:34,385
Violation of the
Roommate Agreement's

295
00:12:34,386 --> 00:12:36,804
overnight guest
notification clause.

296
00:12:36,805 --> 00:12:39,674
Okay, fine,
I-I'm a horrible human being.

297
00:12:39,675 --> 00:12:41,776
I'm the Darth Vader of Pasadena.

298
00:12:41,777 --> 00:12:44,479
You're far too short
to be Darth Vader.

299
00:12:45,397 --> 00:12:48,316
At best you might be
a turncoat Ewok.

300
00:12:48,317 --> 00:12:51,719
My point is: Priya's gone
and it would be much better

301
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:54,405
if no one else found out
about us.

302
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:57,292
You mean you want me
to keep a secret?

303
00:12:57,293 --> 00:12:58,326
Yes.

304
00:12:58,327 --> 00:12:59,994
You know I can't
keep a secret.

305
00:12:59,995 --> 00:13:01,062
You can if you try.

306
00:13:01,063 --> 00:13:02,297
Think about
it this way:

307
00:13:02,298 --> 00:13:05,199
um, if I were Batman
and you were Alfred,

308
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:07,135
you'd keep that
secret, right?

309
00:13:07,136 --> 00:13:09,921
Why do you get
to be Batman?

310
00:13:09,922 --> 00:13:12,056
Because Batman has the secret.

311
00:13:12,057 --> 00:13:13,891
Alfred has secrets, too.

312
00:13:13,892 --> 00:13:15,476
Like what?
Alfred knows

313
00:13:15,477 --> 00:13:17,779
that Barbara Gordon
is Batgirl.

314
00:13:17,780 --> 00:13:19,263
Which I've now just
told to Batman.

315
00:13:19,264 --> 00:13:21,599
See, I cannot
keep a secret.

316
00:13:25,087 --> 00:13:26,821
Ta-dah!

317
00:13:26,822 --> 00:13:27,855
What?

318
00:13:27,856 --> 00:13:30,291
Ta-dah.

319
00:13:30,292 --> 00:13:31,225
It's short for...

320
00:13:31,226 --> 00:13:33,194
? Da-da-da-da! ?

321
00:13:33,195 --> 00:13:35,830
Kind of busy here, Sheldon.

322
00:13:35,831 --> 00:13:37,165
I know,
that's why I shortened it.

323
00:13:38,968 --> 00:13:40,702
What do you want?

324
00:13:40,703 --> 00:13:44,405
I came to go over your alibi
for last night.

325
00:13:44,406 --> 00:13:45,840
What alibi?

326
00:13:45,841 --> 00:13:46,774
You've asked me

327
00:13:46,775 --> 00:13:49,110
to lie on your behalf,
and as you know,

328
00:13:49,111 --> 00:13:52,113
I am deeply uncomfortable
with impromptu dishonesty,

329
00:13:52,114 --> 00:13:53,247
so I've provided you

330
00:13:53,248 --> 00:13:55,450
with an ironclad alibi.

331
00:13:55,451 --> 00:13:58,119
You couldn't have spent
last night with Priya

332
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:00,188
because you were
with another woman.

333
00:14:00,189 --> 00:14:02,423
Oh, I'm so sure
I'm gonna regret this,

334
00:14:02,424 --> 00:14:05,526
but who was I with?

335
00:14:05,527 --> 00:14:09,630
The fun-loving and morally loose
Miss Maggie McGarry.

336
00:14:09,631 --> 00:14:11,065
Oh, God.

337
00:14:11,066 --> 00:14:14,168
You met her at Pasadena's most
popular Irish watering hole,

338
00:14:14,169 --> 00:14:17,605
Lucky Baldwin's, where Maggie
spends her nights tending bar

339
00:14:17,606 --> 00:14:20,808
with a head full of curls
and a heart full of dreams.

340
00:14:20,809 --> 00:14:24,912
"Leonard, call me if you
are interested in coitus.

341
00:14:26,048 --> 00:14:28,549
Sincerely,
Maggie McGarry."

342
00:14:28,550 --> 00:14:29,834
And if anyone were

343
00:14:29,835 --> 00:14:34,756
to actually call that number,
they will hear this.

344
00:14:34,757 --> 00:14:36,858
FEMALE TEXT-TO-SPEECH VOICE:
Top of the morning to you.

345
00:14:36,859 --> 00:14:39,027
You've reached Maggie McGarry.

346
00:14:40,229 --> 00:14:44,399
Leave a message
after the wee little beep.

347
00:14:45,467 --> 00:14:46,801
It's pretty convincing, huh?

348
00:14:46,802 --> 00:14:48,069
That wasn't even
a real person.

349
00:14:48,070 --> 00:14:51,322
And here is
the clincher:

350
00:14:51,323 --> 00:14:55,977
a lock of Maggie's
flaming auburn hair.

351
00:14:55,978 --> 00:14:57,245
Where'd you get that?

352
00:14:57,246 --> 00:15:00,048
From an orangutan
in the primate lab.

353
00:15:00,049 --> 00:15:01,148
An orangutan?

354
00:15:01,149 --> 00:15:02,033
Well, no one's going

355
00:15:02,034 --> 00:15:04,252
to run a DNA test
on it, Leonard.

356
00:15:04,253 --> 00:15:06,320
Honestly, you overthink
everything.

357
00:15:06,321 --> 00:15:09,624
Sheldon, I don't need an alibi.

358
00:15:09,625 --> 00:15:11,392
Nobody's going to ask
about last night

359
00:15:11,393 --> 00:15:13,828
as long as you just
zip your lip.

360
00:15:17,132 --> 00:15:18,433
Thank you.

361
00:15:18,434 --> 00:15:20,768
Now, don't worry,
everything is going to be fine.

363
00:15:34,683 --> 00:15:35,683
Hey.

364
00:15:35,684 --> 00:15:36,951
Hey, Leonard, will you
please tell Howard

365
00:15:36,952 --> 00:15:39,087
my sister has never
been attracted to him?

366
00:15:39,755 --> 00:15:40,922
Come on, Raj,

367
00:15:40,923 --> 00:15:42,423
how am I supposed to know

368
00:15:42,424 --> 00:15:45,660
who she is attracted to
or was attracted to

369
00:15:45,661 --> 00:15:50,298
or who she might be
attracted to in the future?

370
00:15:50,299 --> 00:15:52,934
And I have nothing
to contribute

371
00:15:52,935 --> 00:15:55,803
to this conversation.

372
00:15:56,772 --> 00:15:58,806
Because I, too,
know absolutely nothing

373
00:15:58,807 --> 00:16:01,876
about Priya's preferences
in male companionship.

374
00:16:02,711 --> 00:16:05,379
And with that,
I will re-zip my lip.

375
00:16:06,214 --> 00:16:08,583
Hey, so what did
you guys think

376
00:16:08,584 --> 00:16:10,601
of the new episode
of <i>Caprica</i> last night?

377
00:16:10,602 --> 00:16:11,586
I didn't see it.

378
00:16:11,587 --> 00:16:12,520
Didn't see it?

379
00:16:12,521 --> 00:16:14,122
What were you doing?

380
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:19,060
Uh, I was out.

381
00:16:19,061 --> 00:16:20,862
What, on <i>Caprica</i> night?

382
00:16:20,863 --> 00:16:23,164
Yeah, I, uh, went
for a drink.

383
00:16:23,165 --> 00:16:24,398
Really, you?

384
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:27,168
Where, w-where'd
you go?

385
00:16:27,169 --> 00:16:29,403
To, uh...

386
00:16:34,877 --> 00:16:37,345
Lucky Baldwin's.

387
00:16:37,346 --> 00:16:41,249
Oh, I've heard
of that place.

388
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:44,986
Isn't that Pasadena's
favorite Irish watering hole?

389
00:16:44,987 --> 00:16:46,754
Yes.

390
00:16:46,755 --> 00:16:48,055
Did you meet

391
00:16:48,056 --> 00:16:49,323
anyone interesting there,

392
00:16:49,324 --> 00:16:53,561
perhaps a promiscuous,
redheaded barmaid?

393
00:16:53,562 --> 00:16:55,563
As a matter of fact...
I-I-I-I-I can't, I can't,

394
00:16:55,564 --> 00:16:56,998
I can't do it.

395
00:16:56,999 --> 00:16:59,567
Sure you can, you're doing
fine, it's very believable.

396
00:17:00,485 --> 00:17:03,037
I'm sorry, Raj,
but the truth is,

397
00:17:03,038 --> 00:17:04,906
I was with Priya
last night.

398
00:17:04,907 --> 00:17:06,107
Don't listen to him.

399
00:17:06,108 --> 00:17:07,875
He's still light-headed
from all the Irish whiskey

400
00:17:07,876 --> 00:17:09,744
and pickled eggs
in his system.

401
00:17:09,745 --> 00:17:11,679
What were you doing
with Priya?

402
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:12,713
I believe they engaged
in coitus,

403
00:17:12,714 --> 00:17:14,515
but more
importantly,

404
00:17:14,516 --> 00:17:16,284
if Leonard had not abandoned
his story,

405
00:17:16,285 --> 00:17:18,719
would you have found it
plausible?

406
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:20,254
You slept with my sister?!

407
00:17:20,255 --> 00:17:21,189
Yeah.

408
00:17:21,190 --> 00:17:23,424
How could you?
We had a pact.

409
00:17:23,425 --> 00:17:25,226
Excuse me, I think
"How could you? She's my sister"

410
00:17:25,227 --> 00:17:28,429
takes precedence over
a five-year-old pinky swear.

411
00:17:28,430 --> 00:17:29,847
May I point out,

412
00:17:29,848 --> 00:17:32,099
in a parallel universe,
your friends are saying

413
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:34,735
"Maggie McGarry--
she sounds lovely."

414
00:17:34,736 --> 00:17:38,206
Look, I-I admit it, I may
have crossed a line here,

415
00:17:38,207 --> 00:17:41,776
but come on, Raj, your
sister is a grown woman,

416
00:17:41,777 --> 00:17:44,679
and to her, I'm a forbidden
piece of white chocolate.

417
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:46,781
I don't believe it.

418
00:17:46,782 --> 00:17:48,165
This is a terrible
betrayal of my trust.

419
00:17:48,166 --> 00:17:50,835
No, w-w-would it
help if I told you

420
00:17:50,836 --> 00:17:54,789
that I offered her my heart,
and she kind of stomped on it?

421
00:17:54,790 --> 00:17:57,558
How hard did she stomp?

422
00:17:57,559 --> 00:17:59,560
Very hard.

423
00:17:59,561 --> 00:18:01,879
Okay, I'm good.

424
00:18:03,732 --> 00:18:05,933
Well, Raj,

425
00:18:05,934 --> 00:18:09,337
I just want to say that I'd
never betray your trust.

426
00:18:09,338 --> 00:18:11,889
Unlike Leonard,
I respect you.

427
00:18:11,890 --> 00:18:12,907
Really?

428
00:18:12,908 --> 00:18:15,559
Mm-hmm.

429
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:17,712
Was it out of respect
that you didn't tell Raj

430
00:18:17,713 --> 00:18:20,348
about the time you dropped
his iPhone in a urinal?

431
00:18:21,199 --> 00:18:24,485
Dude, I put that thing
on my face!

432
00:18:24,486 --> 00:18:27,355
I think a more amusing
violation of Raj's trust

433
00:18:27,356 --> 00:18:29,991
is when Howard convinced him
that foreigners give presents

434
00:18:29,992 --> 00:18:32,910
to Americans
on Thanksgiving.

435
00:18:33,795 --> 00:18:35,329
Hey, I didn't see
you giving back

436
00:18:35,330 --> 00:18:38,165
your Snoopy
snow cone maker.

437
00:18:38,166 --> 00:18:39,300
That was all a lie?

438
00:18:39,301 --> 00:18:41,435
This year's gifts
are already wrapped.

439
00:18:41,436 --> 00:18:44,171
And as long as we're talking
about betraying our friends,

440
00:18:44,172 --> 00:18:46,641
how about the month Sheldon
spent grinding up insects

441
00:18:46,642 --> 00:18:48,376
and mixing them
into Leonard's food?

442
00:18:48,377 --> 00:18:49,744
Well, excuse me.

443
00:18:49,745 --> 00:18:51,345
That was not a betrayal.

444
00:18:51,346 --> 00:18:53,481
That was an experiment
to determine

445
00:18:53,482 --> 00:18:57,685
at what concentration
food starts tasting "mothy."

446
00:18:57,686 --> 00:19:00,855
You put moths in my food?!

447
00:19:01,690 --> 00:19:04,725
For science.

448
00:19:04,726 --> 00:19:07,194
I can't believe you kissed
my sister with moth mouth.

449
00:19:07,195 --> 00:19:11,365
Well, I can't believe you
used Sheldon's toothbrush.

450
00:19:11,366 --> 00:19:13,668
You used my toothbrush?

451
00:19:13,669 --> 00:19:16,570
Not the brush part,
just the little rubber thing

452
00:19:16,571 --> 00:19:20,408
to pick food from my teeth
and massage my gums.

453
00:19:26,048 --> 00:19:29,083
Okay, I-I think
it's safe to say

454
00:19:29,084 --> 00:19:30,584
that we've all done
some things

455
00:19:30,585 --> 00:19:32,353
we're not
particularly proud of.

456
00:19:33,322 --> 00:19:34,522
But come on,
we're friends.

457
00:19:34,523 --> 00:19:38,492
Friends overlook
each other's minor lapses.

458
00:19:39,695 --> 00:19:42,496
For the record, Howard, I'm
sorry that I broke our pact.

459
00:19:42,497 --> 00:19:44,815
Thank you.

460
00:19:44,816 --> 00:19:47,651
And I'm sorry
about your phone

461
00:19:47,652 --> 00:19:49,470
and Thanksgiving.

462
00:19:49,471 --> 00:19:50,838
And while we're at it,

463
00:19:50,839 --> 00:19:53,274
you don't have to wash our
clothes on the Fourth of July.

464
00:19:54,743 --> 00:19:56,827
As long as we're apologizing,

465
00:19:56,828 --> 00:20:00,081
Sheldon, I'm, I'm sorry
I used your toothbrush.

466
00:20:00,082 --> 00:20:02,316
And I'm sorry...

467
00:20:02,317 --> 00:20:03,818
but that behavior
is beyond the pale

468
00:20:03,819 --> 00:20:05,486
and cannot be tolerated.

469
00:20:05,487 --> 00:20:07,621
We are no longer friends.

470
00:20:07,622 --> 00:20:11,659
I got you a talking Thomas the
Tank Engine for Thanksgiving.

471
00:20:11,660 --> 00:20:14,628
With real puffing smoke?

472
00:20:14,629 --> 00:20:15,863
Yes.

473
00:20:16,665 --> 00:20:18,182
All right.

474
00:20:20,485 --> 00:20:22,203
But I'm watching you.

475
00:20:33,638 --> 00:20:35,088
Hey, you've got Snoopy out.

476
00:20:35,089 --> 00:20:36,306
Can I have a snow cone?

477
00:20:36,307 --> 00:20:39,176
Well, sure.

478
00:20:41,112 --> 00:20:42,095
This is pretty good.

479
00:20:42,096 --> 00:20:43,380
What flavor is this?

480
00:20:43,381 --> 00:20:46,283
Guess.

481
00:20:46,284 --> 00:20:47,884
Papaya?
No.

482
00:20:47,885 --> 00:20:50,520
Guava?
You're so close.

483
00:20:50,521 --> 00:20:51,521
I give up.

484
00:20:51,522 --> 00:20:53,924
Mango caterpillar.

485
00:20:55,812 --> 00:20:57,079
What are
you doing?!

486
00:20:59,763 --> 00:21:01,146
You said you
liked it.
