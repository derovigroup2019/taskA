1
00:00:02,192 --> 00:00:06,512
Why hast thou forsaken me,
O deity whose existence I doubt?

2
00:00:07,847 --> 00:00:10,849
Here. Breathe
into this bag.

3
00:00:12,135 --> 00:00:13,335
What's going on?

4
00:00:13,336 --> 00:00:16,005
They stole everything, Leonard!

5
00:00:16,006 --> 00:00:17,439
Everything.

6
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:19,191
Are you the roommate?

7
00:00:19,192 --> 00:00:21,276
Yeah, Leonard Hofstadter.
What happened?

8
00:00:21,277 --> 00:00:23,512
Your friend here called 911
to report a robbery.

9
00:00:23,513 --> 00:00:25,447
Oh, my God, what did they get?

10
00:00:25,448 --> 00:00:26,732
What didn't they get?

11
00:00:26,733 --> 00:00:28,684
They got my enchanted weapons,

12
00:00:28,685 --> 00:00:30,653
my vicious gladiator armor,

13
00:00:30,654 --> 00:00:32,988
my wand of untainted power,

14
00:00:32,989 --> 00:00:35,958
and all my gold!

15
00:00:35,959 --> 00:00:37,760
You called the police

16
00:00:37,761 --> 00:00:40,529
because someone hacked your
World of Warcraft account?

17
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:42,965
What choice did I have?

18
00:00:42,966 --> 00:00:46,168
The mighty Sheldor,
level 85 blood elf,

19
00:00:46,169 --> 00:00:47,970
hero of the Eastern kingdoms,

20
00:00:47,971 --> 00:00:52,174
has been picked clean, like
a carcass in the desert sun.

21
00:00:53,443 --> 00:00:55,044
Plus, the FBI hung up on me.

22
00:00:56,780 --> 00:00:58,981
Into the bag.

23
00:00:59,649 --> 00:01:02,985
They took my battle ostrich!

24
00:01:02,986 --> 00:01:05,320
Oh, no, not Glenn!
Yes!

25
00:01:05,321 --> 00:01:06,655
Glenn!

26
00:01:06,656 --> 00:01:08,857
The only bird I ever loved.

27
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:12,161
Good luck, fellas.

28
00:01:12,162 --> 00:01:13,862
Oh. Well, thank you, officer.

29
00:01:13,863 --> 00:01:15,130
Wait a minute!

30
00:01:15,131 --> 00:01:16,632
You're not going to do anything?

31
00:01:16,633 --> 00:01:17,800
Mr. Cooper,
there's nothing...

32
00:01:17,801 --> 00:01:19,301
Dr. Cooper.

33
00:01:20,170 --> 00:01:21,870
Seriously?

34
00:01:22,972 --> 00:01:25,741
Not the kind with
access to drugs.

35
00:01:26,676 --> 00:01:28,711
Fine. Dr. Cooper.

36
00:01:28,712 --> 00:01:30,145
I'm sorry for your loss,

37
00:01:30,146 --> 00:01:31,680
but the Pasadena
Police Department

38
00:01:31,681 --> 00:01:33,916
doesn't have jurisdiction in...

39
00:01:33,917 --> 00:01:35,818
Pandora.

40
00:01:35,819 --> 00:01:38,487
<i>That's from Avatar!</i>

41
00:01:39,789 --> 00:01:41,824
World of Warcraft
takes place in Azeroth.

42
00:01:41,825 --> 00:01:44,693
Goodness gracious, how are you
allowed to carry a gun?

43
00:01:45,795 --> 00:01:49,832
Can you at least refer me
to a rogue ex-cop?

44
00:01:49,833 --> 00:01:51,166
What?

45
00:01:51,167 --> 00:01:53,969
Wh... you know, one who was
drummed off the force

46
00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:55,804
because he refused
to play by the rules,

47
00:01:55,805 --> 00:01:57,506
and now he hires himself out

48
00:01:57,507 --> 00:02:00,709
to impose his own brand
of rough justice?

49
00:02:01,578 --> 00:02:03,445
No.

50
00:02:04,831 --> 00:02:06,498
Thank you, officer.

51
00:02:07,383 --> 00:02:10,018
<i>It's all gone. All gone.</i>

52
00:02:10,019 --> 00:02:11,887
I'm really sorry, Sheldon.

53
00:02:11,888 --> 00:02:13,555
What kind of world
do we live in,

54
00:02:13,556 --> 00:02:17,493
where a man would take
another man's battle ostrich?

55
00:02:17,494 --> 00:02:19,394
I don't know.

56
00:02:20,196 --> 00:02:21,764
This act of aggression
must be met

57
00:02:21,765 --> 00:02:24,133
with swift and cruel ferocity.

58
00:02:24,134 --> 00:02:28,771
It is time to cry havoc,
and let slip the dogs of war.

59
00:02:28,772 --> 00:02:30,939
I'm on it.

60
00:02:34,177 --> 00:02:37,045
Hi, Mrs. Wolowitz.
Is, is Howard there?

61
00:02:38,348 --> 00:02:40,215
Okay, thanks.

62
00:02:40,216 --> 00:02:41,717
That particular dog of war

63
00:02:41,718 --> 00:02:43,819
will have to call you back
after his bath.

64
00:02:47,257 --> 00:02:49,558
See if Raj is done with Pilates.

Three thousand hours
clicking on that mouse,

69
00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:22,338
collecting weapons and gold.

70
00:03:22,339 --> 00:03:27,210
It's almost as if it was
a huge waste of time.

71
00:03:27,211 --> 00:03:28,845
Whoever did this
knew what they were doing.

72
00:03:28,846 --> 00:03:30,880
He got in and out
of your account in under

73
00:03:30,881 --> 00:03:33,382
15 minutes, transferred
all your stuff,

74
00:03:33,383 --> 00:03:34,617
and didn't leave
a digital fingerprint.

75
00:03:35,853 --> 00:03:38,421
There isn't enough
chamomile tea in the world

76
00:03:38,422 --> 00:03:41,324
to quell the rage in my heart.

77
00:03:42,459 --> 00:03:44,026
Hold on. I'm talking to an orc

78
00:03:44,027 --> 00:03:45,595
under the bridge
in Thunder Bluff

79
00:03:45,596 --> 00:03:48,431
who says if we pay him, he'll
help us track down your things.

80
00:03:48,432 --> 00:03:49,932
Can we trust him?

81
00:03:49,933 --> 00:03:52,235
I should say so;
He appears to be a member

82
00:03:52,236 --> 00:03:54,771
of the Nigerian royal family.

83
00:03:56,573 --> 00:03:59,642
Whoa! Somebody's auctioning off
a jeweled ostrich bridle!

84
00:03:59,643 --> 00:04:01,277
No. Glenn's was leather.

85
00:04:02,146 --> 00:04:04,313
He was a simple ostrich.

86
00:04:04,314 --> 00:04:07,316
Is! Is, I haven't given up hope.

87
00:04:08,552 --> 00:04:10,086
Hey.

88
00:04:10,087 --> 00:04:12,321
Hey, Penny. We're kind of in
the middle of a crisis, here.

89
00:04:12,322 --> 00:04:14,690
Oh, I know. Bernadette told me.

90
00:04:14,691 --> 00:04:18,027
Sorry, Sheldon. I know
that game meant a lot to you.

91
00:04:18,028 --> 00:04:20,096
What... "that game"?

92
00:04:21,198 --> 00:04:25,034
Excuse me, Penny, but
Doodle Jump is a game.

93
00:04:25,035 --> 00:04:27,703
Angry Birds is a game.

94
00:04:27,704 --> 00:04:29,172
World of Warcraft is a

95
00:04:29,173 --> 00:04:33,342
massively multi-player
online role-playing...

96
00:04:33,343 --> 00:04:35,278
all right,
technically it's a game.

97
00:04:36,613 --> 00:04:40,316
Bad news, the Nigerian prince
may be a fraud.

98
00:04:40,317 --> 00:04:42,551
Okay, well, anyways,
I brought you

99
00:04:42,552 --> 00:04:44,103
a day-old cheesecake
to cheer you up!

100
00:04:44,104 --> 00:04:46,689
Stale pastry is hollow succor

101
00:04:46,690 --> 00:04:49,158
to a man who is
bereft of ostrich.

102
00:04:50,027 --> 00:04:51,460
Just say "thank you."

103
00:04:51,461 --> 00:04:54,030
I thought I just did.

104
00:04:54,031 --> 00:04:57,867
All right. See you later.

105
00:04:57,868 --> 00:04:58,968
Oh! Hello.

106
00:04:58,969 --> 00:05:01,204
Oh, hi! I was just
dropping off a cheesecake

107
00:05:01,205 --> 00:05:04,373
to Sheldon. He was robbed
of a bunch of imaginary crap

108
00:05:04,374 --> 00:05:06,976
that's useful in
a make-believe place.

109
00:05:07,845 --> 00:05:09,312
I don't know what that means.

110
00:05:09,313 --> 00:05:12,148
Yeah, well, sadly, I do.

111
00:05:14,384 --> 00:05:16,352
Did you know last weekend
Priya took Leonard

112
00:05:16,353 --> 00:05:17,753
rollerblading at the beach?

113
00:05:17,754 --> 00:05:19,522
Can you believe that?

114
00:05:19,523 --> 00:05:22,475
I feel like I'm supposed
to say "that bitch,"

115
00:05:22,476 --> 00:05:25,027
but I don't have
enough information.

116
00:05:25,028 --> 00:05:27,396
I am the one who
spent two years

117
00:05:27,397 --> 00:05:28,598
trying to get him to even

118
00:05:28,599 --> 00:05:30,233
go to the beach
in the first place.

119
00:05:30,234 --> 00:05:32,285
And he was so phobic about
stepping on medical waste,

120
00:05:32,286 --> 00:05:34,203
I had to carry him
to the water.

121
00:05:34,204 --> 00:05:36,906
I took Howard to the beach once.

122
00:05:36,907 --> 00:05:39,976
He almost burst into flames
like a vampire.

123
00:05:41,044 --> 00:05:44,130
So what's the thanks
I get for turning Leonard

124
00:05:44,131 --> 00:05:45,831
into quality boyfriend material?

125
00:05:45,832 --> 00:05:48,017
I have to tiptoe around
his new girlfriend.

126
00:05:48,018 --> 00:05:50,670
I think you're on.
Oh.

127
00:05:50,671 --> 00:05:53,923
That bitch!

128
00:05:53,924 --> 00:05:56,692
Want some coffee liqueur
on your ice cream?

129
00:05:56,693 --> 00:05:59,595
Ah, here's the alcohol
and drug peer pressure

130
00:05:59,596 --> 00:06:01,097
Mother warned me about.

131
00:06:02,199 --> 00:06:04,934
I was starting to think
it was never going to happen.

132
00:06:04,935 --> 00:06:07,670
Yes, please.

133
00:06:07,671 --> 00:06:09,372
You guys should've seen Leonard
when I first met him.

134
00:06:09,373 --> 00:06:10,373
There was no eye contact.

135
00:06:10,374 --> 00:06:11,774
He was either looking
up at the ceiling,

136
00:06:11,775 --> 00:06:13,442
or down at his shoes.

137
00:06:13,443 --> 00:06:15,378
I'm drunk.

138
00:06:17,147 --> 00:06:19,165
You know, for the
first couple of months,

139
00:06:19,166 --> 00:06:20,983
whenever I would
take off my bra,

140
00:06:20,984 --> 00:06:25,821
he would giggle and say,
"Oh, boy, my breast friends!"

141
00:06:25,822 --> 00:06:28,057
Well, if it makes you
feel any better,

142
00:06:28,058 --> 00:06:30,026
I'm never speaking
to Priya again.

143
00:06:30,027 --> 00:06:31,093
No, don't do that.

144
00:06:31,094 --> 00:06:32,645
No reason to be mean to her.

145
00:06:32,646 --> 00:06:36,065
This may be the
alcohol talking...

146
00:06:36,066 --> 00:06:37,300
but I believe there is.

147
00:06:37,301 --> 00:06:39,468
Are you familiar
with the recent study

148
00:06:39,469 --> 00:06:41,904
of Tanzanian chimpanzees
by Nishida and Hosaka

149
00:06:41,905 --> 00:06:44,140
out of Kyoto University?

150
00:06:44,141 --> 00:06:47,376
No, but I can name
all the Kardashians.

151
00:06:47,377 --> 00:06:50,279
Primates, such as ourselves,
have a natural instinct

152
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:52,882
to ostracize ill-mannered
members of the troop.

153
00:06:52,883 --> 00:06:54,216
Bernadette's urge to

154
00:06:54,217 --> 00:06:57,053
shun, scowl or
fling her waste at Priya

155
00:06:57,054 --> 00:06:59,288
is hard-wired into her DNA.

156
00:06:59,289 --> 00:07:03,192
I don't have an urge
to fling my waste.

157
00:07:03,193 --> 00:07:05,528
Believe me, it's there,
we all have it.

158
00:07:05,529 --> 00:07:08,698
Hit me with some more booze,
and I'll show you.

159
00:07:10,884 --> 00:07:13,135
All right, here we are...
this is the tavern

160
00:07:13,136 --> 00:07:16,806
where all the black-market
weapon trades go down.

161
00:07:16,807 --> 00:07:19,608
I don't think my character
should be in a place like this.

162
00:07:19,609 --> 00:07:21,811
Everyone's undressing
her with their eyes.

163
00:07:21,812 --> 00:07:23,980
Maybe if you stop
dropping your sword

164
00:07:23,981 --> 00:07:26,215
and bending over to pick it up.

165
00:07:27,634 --> 00:07:29,268
Okay, what exactly
are we looking for?

166
00:07:29,269 --> 00:07:31,354
Redheaded troll,
goes by the name of Glumly.

167
00:07:31,355 --> 00:07:32,388
According to the
message boards,

168
00:07:32,389 --> 00:07:33,923
if you want to
move stolen goods

169
00:07:33,924 --> 00:07:36,058
and it's after school
hours, he's your guy.

170
00:07:36,059 --> 00:07:37,326
Leonard, is this going

171
00:07:37,327 --> 00:07:39,128
to take much longer?
I thought we were

172
00:07:39,129 --> 00:07:40,529
going to spend
some time together.

173
00:07:40,530 --> 00:07:41,964
Uh, we are.
In the meantime,

174
00:07:41,965 --> 00:07:44,767
you're welcome to whip up
a quick character and join us.

175
00:07:44,768 --> 00:07:46,335
Seriously?

176
00:07:46,336 --> 00:07:48,938
Well, you have to put
in a credit card number,

177
00:07:48,939 --> 00:07:50,906
but it's fun.

178
00:07:50,907 --> 00:07:52,675
Maybe I should just go home.

179
00:07:52,676 --> 00:07:54,176
Our troll just walked
in! I got him!

180
00:07:54,177 --> 00:07:56,012
We got him.
We're almost done.

181
00:07:56,013 --> 00:07:57,013
So, how do

182
00:07:57,014 --> 00:07:58,297
you guys want to play this?

183
00:07:58,298 --> 00:07:59,849
Be ruthless.
You tell him

184
00:07:59,850 --> 00:08:02,151
if he doesn't start talking,
we'll register a complaint

185
00:08:02,152 --> 00:08:05,054
with his Internet
service provider.

186
00:08:05,055 --> 00:08:08,524
<i>Sheldon, what if he gets his
Internet from his cable company?</i>

187
00:08:08,525 --> 00:08:13,462
He could lose his HBO and all their
delightful original programming.

188
00:08:13,463 --> 00:08:16,799
I don't care!
I'm losin' it, man!

189
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,267
Why don't we play this smart?

190
00:08:18,268 --> 00:08:20,569
Try a little
"good goblin, bad goblin."

191
00:08:20,570 --> 00:08:22,638
Oh, dear Lord.

192
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:24,907
Nah, I think we have
to be more subtle.

193
00:08:24,908 --> 00:08:27,877
Okay, I see where
this is going.

194
00:08:27,878 --> 00:08:30,446
Fine, I'll have sex with him.

195
00:08:32,349 --> 00:08:35,551
That's not where it was going.

196
00:08:35,552 --> 00:08:38,788
Good, because
I would hate that.

197
00:08:41,391 --> 00:08:43,759
Leonard, you're busy... let's
talk tomorrow. Oh, wait.

198
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:46,345
Hang on. Are you upset?
No, no, I think

199
00:08:46,346 --> 00:08:48,864
it's sexy to date a boy
trapped in a man's body.

200
00:08:49,866 --> 00:08:50,866
Good, good.

201
00:08:50,867 --> 00:08:53,569
I'll tell you what happens.

202
00:08:54,738 --> 00:08:57,473
<i>And people think I
don't get sarcasm.</i>

203
00:09:00,610 --> 00:09:03,612
Well, well, well.

204
00:09:04,915 --> 00:09:06,165
Look who it is.

205
00:09:06,166 --> 00:09:07,249
Okay, be nice.

206
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:08,451
Hello.

207
00:09:08,452 --> 00:09:10,369
Hi. We're just
heading out for a drink.

208
00:09:10,370 --> 00:09:13,389
Because I do that now.

209
00:09:14,324 --> 00:09:15,424
Count your blessings

210
00:09:15,425 --> 00:09:17,593
you're not a Tanzanian chimp.

211
00:09:18,728 --> 00:09:19,762
What?

212
00:09:19,763 --> 00:09:20,713
Don't listen to her...

213
00:09:20,714 --> 00:09:22,631
she's had a lot of ice cream.

214
00:09:23,333 --> 00:09:24,567
Do you want to join us?

215
00:09:24,568 --> 00:09:27,236
Oh, thank you,
but I have work to do.

216
00:09:29,339 --> 00:09:31,807
Four women walk
down the stairs...

217
00:09:31,808 --> 00:09:34,393
how many reach the lobby?

218
00:09:39,679 --> 00:09:42,314
Did your sister say anything
when you got home last night?

219
00:09:42,315 --> 00:09:44,666
Oh, no, don't put me
in the middle of this.

220
00:09:44,667 --> 00:09:46,334
I'm not going to
be your go-between.

221
00:09:46,335 --> 00:09:47,502
Come on, help me out.

222
00:09:47,503 --> 00:09:48,903
Am I in trouble?

223
00:09:48,904 --> 00:09:50,855
There's no reason to worry.

224
00:09:50,856 --> 00:09:52,007
That's a relief.

225
00:09:52,008 --> 00:09:53,208
I'm sure many women

226
00:09:53,209 --> 00:09:55,143
in happy relationships
spend their nights

227
00:09:55,144 --> 00:09:57,545
Skyping with their
ex-boyfriend Sanjay.

228
00:10:00,916 --> 00:10:03,118
Good news, gentlemen...
I found our hacker.

229
00:10:03,119 --> 00:10:04,452
What?
Really?

230
00:10:04,453 --> 00:10:06,320
Yeah. No one can hide from me,

231
00:10:06,321 --> 00:10:08,006
not Waldo, not Carmen San Diego,

232
00:10:08,007 --> 00:10:10,225
not even topless
Natalie Portman.

233
00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:13,061
I've never said
these words before,

234
00:10:13,062 --> 00:10:15,463
but good job, Howard!

235
00:10:16,532 --> 00:10:20,969
Thanks. Our culprit
is one Mr. Todd Zarnecki, 2711

236
00:10:20,970 --> 00:10:22,170
Ocean View Road,

237
00:10:22,171 --> 00:10:23,738
Carlsbad, California.

238
00:10:23,739 --> 00:10:26,741
The name and the address
drip with evil.

239
00:10:26,742 --> 00:10:28,076
What else do we know about him?

240
00:10:28,077 --> 00:10:29,894
Why, quite a bit, actually.

241
00:10:29,895 --> 00:10:33,114
I'll bet he's some loser
who lives with his parents.

242
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:40,288
Yes, he does live
with his parents.

243
00:10:40,289 --> 00:10:44,592
Here's a Google Earth
shot of their house.

244
00:10:44,593 --> 00:10:46,561
Excellent!
It's in a cul-de-sac.

245
00:10:46,562 --> 00:10:47,729
We can box him in.

246
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:50,632
Hold on, you're thinking
of going there?

247
00:10:50,633 --> 00:10:52,967
Carlsbad is only
a couple of hours away.

248
00:10:52,968 --> 00:10:54,085
Fine.

249
00:10:54,086 --> 00:10:56,037
You walk up to the house,
knock on the door

250
00:10:56,038 --> 00:10:58,039
and demand your stuff back.
What if he says no?

251
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:00,275
I don't know if you've been
following the news, Leonard,

252
00:11:00,276 --> 00:11:02,077
but there have been
some terrific advancements

253
00:11:02,078 --> 00:11:03,678
in the field of torture.

254
00:11:05,581 --> 00:11:07,148
No one's getting tortured.

255
00:11:07,149 --> 00:11:09,384
Fine, we'll abide by
the Geneva Convention.

256
00:11:09,385 --> 00:11:10,819
But ask yourself this,

257
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:12,854
in the course of our lives,

258
00:11:12,855 --> 00:11:15,190
how much lunch money
has been taken from us?

259
00:11:15,191 --> 00:11:16,941
How many kites?

260
00:11:16,942 --> 00:11:19,694
How many Scooby-Doo
Trapper Keepers?

261
00:11:20,362 --> 00:11:21,830
I totally had one of those.

262
00:11:21,831 --> 00:11:23,231
Of course you did.

263
00:11:23,232 --> 00:11:25,767
It was a fun and practical way
of organizing your school work.

264
00:11:25,768 --> 00:11:28,119
But the bullies
took it from us.

265
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:29,104
Well, no more.

266
00:11:29,105 --> 00:11:31,272
Tonight, we take back
our dignity,

267
00:11:31,273 --> 00:11:33,374
our birthright and our pride.

268
00:11:33,375 --> 00:11:34,542
What do you say?

269
00:11:34,543 --> 00:11:36,044
Who's with me?

270
00:11:40,149 --> 00:11:43,918
I have a hip-hop aerobics class
at 5:00; could we go after?

271
00:11:43,919 --> 00:11:45,887
Sure.

272
00:11:46,722 --> 00:11:47,755
Also, tonight's the Sabbath

273
00:11:47,756 --> 00:11:49,324
and my mother and I
have a tradition of

274
00:11:49,325 --> 00:11:51,526
<i>lighting the candles and
watching Wheel of Fortune, so...</i>

275
00:11:51,527 --> 00:11:52,560
If we could leave

276
00:11:52,561 --> 00:11:53,862
at 8:00, we'd still be able to

277
00:11:53,863 --> 00:11:55,463
regain our birthright
at 10:00, 10:30 latest.

278
00:11:55,464 --> 00:11:57,565
Fine.

279
00:11:57,566 --> 00:11:59,868
Leonard?

280
00:11:59,869 --> 00:12:02,537
Oh, geez, I-I don't know
if I can ditch Priya

281
00:12:02,538 --> 00:12:03,872
two nights in a row.

282
00:12:03,873 --> 00:12:05,039
Oh, come on, man.

283
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:07,709
Bros before...

284
00:12:11,046 --> 00:12:12,313
my sister.

285
00:12:13,282 --> 00:12:14,816
Aw, screw it.

286
00:12:14,817 --> 00:12:15,950
I'm in.
Me, too.

287
00:12:15,951 --> 00:12:17,819
And me.

288
00:12:18,637 --> 00:12:20,839
One moment.

289
00:12:24,293 --> 00:12:26,561
I'm hell-bent on catching
a cyber criminal,

290
00:12:26,562 --> 00:12:28,813
not the common cold.

291
00:12:33,002 --> 00:12:34,802
I'm sorry, I thought
this delay was

292
00:12:34,803 --> 00:12:37,405
<i>so you could watch Wheel of
Fortune with your mother.</i>

293
00:12:37,406 --> 00:12:38,640
I am.

294
00:12:38,641 --> 00:12:40,275
She's just bleaching
her mustache.

295
00:12:41,143 --> 00:12:42,477
Check it out.

296
00:12:42,478 --> 00:12:44,646
Hey, Ma!
"Before and After!"

297
00:12:44,647 --> 00:12:48,082
Four words, 17 letters,
two N's, one V!

298
00:12:48,083 --> 00:12:50,518
"Fanny pack of wolves!"

299
00:12:52,922 --> 00:12:53,988
That's incredible.

300
00:12:53,989 --> 00:12:55,657
<i>Yeah, she's kind of
a Wheel savant.</i>

301
00:12:56,992 --> 00:12:59,594
Uh-oh, that's Priya.

302
00:13:00,729 --> 00:13:04,265
Sitar music for her ringtone
is not cool, dude.

303
00:13:04,266 --> 00:13:05,934
Hit the...

304
00:13:06,936 --> 00:13:09,804
Hey, sweetie.

305
00:13:09,805 --> 00:13:11,072
Yeah, I'm sorry.

306
00:13:11,073 --> 00:13:12,974
I'm gonna be working late.

307
00:13:14,243 --> 00:13:16,277
Yeah, I-I miss you, too.

308
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:19,280
Okay, sure, I'll call you
when I get home.

309
00:13:19,281 --> 00:13:20,782
Okay, bye-bye.

310
00:13:20,783 --> 00:13:22,050
Very nice.

311
00:13:22,051 --> 00:13:23,851
You lie to my sister.

312
00:13:25,187 --> 00:13:27,455
That's the nicest thing
he does to your sister.

313
00:13:34,797 --> 00:13:36,297
Oh, guess who.

314
00:13:36,298 --> 00:13:37,832
Cover for me.

315
00:13:39,768 --> 00:13:41,169
Hello, Priya. What's up?

316
00:13:41,170 --> 00:13:43,538
How would I know
if Leonard's at work or not?

317
00:13:43,539 --> 00:13:46,074
Don't be suspicious.

318
00:13:46,075 --> 00:13:47,842
Look, if you want your
relationship with Leonard

319
00:13:47,843 --> 00:13:49,510
to continue,
you're going to have to believe

320
00:13:49,511 --> 00:13:51,279
whatever wild-eyed,
cockamamie excuse

321
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:53,514
the white devil
has the nerve to offer you.

322
00:13:55,317 --> 00:13:58,253
Okay? Yeah, bye-bye.

323
00:13:59,221 --> 00:14:01,089
You owe me.

324
00:14:01,890 --> 00:14:03,825
New puzzle, Ma!

325
00:14:03,826 --> 00:14:05,126
"Same name"!

326
00:14:05,127 --> 00:14:06,828
One N, two D's, three O's!

327
00:14:06,829 --> 00:14:09,530
Whoopi and Rube Goldberg!

328
00:14:09,531 --> 00:14:10,865
That's uncanny.

329
00:14:10,866 --> 00:14:12,700
I know.
It's her superpower.

330
00:14:12,701 --> 00:14:14,769
Well, that and jiggling
her arm fat.

331
00:14:17,539 --> 00:14:20,174
I can't believe we're going
all the way to San Diego

332
00:14:20,175 --> 00:14:21,943
to confront this guy.

333
00:14:21,944 --> 00:14:24,579
Yeah, we're kind of
bad-asses, aren't we?

334
00:14:24,580 --> 00:14:25,947
Totally.

335
00:14:25,948 --> 00:14:27,815
Hey, how about
we stay the night

336
00:14:27,816 --> 00:14:30,285
and hit Legoland
in the morning?

337
00:14:30,286 --> 00:14:31,886
Sea World is better.

338
00:14:31,887 --> 00:14:35,923
It has Shamu, who is
literally tons of fun.

339
00:14:35,924 --> 00:14:39,193
But for the moment, let's stay
focused on Todd Zarnecki.

340
00:14:39,194 --> 00:14:41,863
Yeah, we're coming for you,
Todd Zarnecki.

341
00:14:41,864 --> 00:14:45,366
And for the record, Legoland
is more interactive.

342
00:14:46,035 --> 00:14:47,435
I almost feel sorry

343
00:14:47,436 --> 00:14:51,039
for the poor fool, sitting in
his split-level suburban ranch,

344
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:52,373
unaware that

345
00:14:52,374 --> 00:14:56,077
a vengeful horde is barreling
down the San Diego Freeway

346
00:14:56,078 --> 00:14:58,313
at 71 miles an hour.

347
00:14:58,314 --> 00:14:59,780
Ease up there, lead foot.

348
00:14:59,781 --> 00:15:01,249
You trying to get us killed?

349
00:15:02,885 --> 00:15:05,486
I took the liberty
of burning us

350
00:15:05,487 --> 00:15:07,588
a mix of heroic questing music.

351
00:15:09,091 --> 00:15:12,860
This says "Beyonce
Bootylicious Dance Mix."

352
00:15:12,861 --> 00:15:14,529
It's a
re-writable CD.

353
00:15:14,530 --> 00:15:16,464
Just put it in.

354
00:15:16,465 --> 00:15:18,182
Beyonce? Really?

355
00:15:18,183 --> 00:15:20,034
She's curvy and she owns it.

356
00:15:20,035 --> 00:15:21,569
I like that.

357
00:15:29,361 --> 00:15:31,979
Oh, yeah, I'm feeling it.

358
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:34,815
We are winged fury!

359
00:15:34,816 --> 00:15:36,217
Which is still no excuse

360
00:15:36,218 --> 00:15:38,119
for going over
the posted speed limit.

361
00:15:43,392 --> 00:15:45,927
Next time we go to
kick someone's ass,

362
00:15:45,928 --> 00:15:47,528
we take the train.

363
00:15:47,529 --> 00:15:50,965
I always prefer the train.

364
00:15:52,184 --> 00:15:54,185
Sheldon, let's go.

365
00:15:55,170 --> 00:15:56,771
Coming.

366
00:15:59,875 --> 00:16:01,709
Why did you bring that?

367
00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:04,729
No weapon strikes more fear
into a man's heart

368
00:16:04,730 --> 00:16:06,748
than a Klingon bat'leth.

369
00:16:06,749 --> 00:16:09,901
Okay, let's get
clear on something.

370
00:16:09,902 --> 00:16:11,986
We're just going to tell
this guy to transfer all of

371
00:16:11,987 --> 00:16:14,789
your stuff back into your
account and then be on our way.

372
00:16:14,790 --> 00:16:17,325
No one's bat'lething anybody.

373
00:16:18,260 --> 00:16:21,195
So my blade shall not
taste blood tonight?

374
00:16:21,196 --> 00:16:23,731
No.

375
00:16:23,732 --> 00:16:27,335
Well, now I just feel silly
holding it.

376
00:16:27,336 --> 00:16:29,003
Come on.

377
00:16:29,004 --> 00:16:31,839
Can I at least
kick down the door?

378
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:34,308
You're welcome to try, but
the other day, it took you

379
00:16:34,309 --> 00:16:37,245
15 minutes to get
into a FedEx box.

380
00:16:40,616 --> 00:16:41,783
Who is it?

381
00:16:41,784 --> 00:16:43,584
Your doom!

382
00:16:43,585 --> 00:16:44,886
Don't say "your doom."

383
00:16:44,887 --> 00:16:47,288
Who opens the door
for their doom?

384
00:16:47,289 --> 00:16:48,656
Good point.

385
00:16:48,657 --> 00:16:50,658
Basket of puppies.

386
00:16:53,262 --> 00:16:54,395
What?

387
00:16:56,999 --> 00:16:58,933
Sheldon?

388
00:17:00,736 --> 00:17:03,104
Are you Todd Zarnecki?

389
00:17:03,105 --> 00:17:04,739
Yeah. Who are you?

390
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:06,941
I am Sheldor of Azeroth.

391
00:17:06,942 --> 00:17:08,576
I want my things back.

392
00:17:08,577 --> 00:17:09,710
I don't think so.

393
00:17:09,711 --> 00:17:10,912
Let me see that.

394
00:17:10,913 --> 00:17:12,213
Careful.
That's a collectible.

395
00:17:12,214 --> 00:17:13,297
I know.

396
00:17:13,298 --> 00:17:16,884
I've always wanted one.

397
00:17:23,976 --> 00:17:27,094
Well, he's even more cunning
than we thought.

398
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:33,367
You know, the joke's on him.

399
00:17:33,368 --> 00:17:35,703
Without the certificate of
authenticity,

400
00:17:35,704 --> 00:17:38,339
that bat'leth is worthless.

401
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:41,609
Yeah, he walked
right into our trap.

402
00:17:42,878 --> 00:17:46,581
Legoland seems like
a hollow dream now.

403
00:17:50,135 --> 00:17:51,836
What's the matter?
Something's wrong.

404
00:17:51,837 --> 00:17:53,488
I'm not getting any gas.

405
00:17:59,812 --> 00:18:02,964
Anybody know anything about
internal combustion engines?

406
00:18:02,965 --> 00:18:03,931
Of course.

407
00:18:03,932 --> 00:18:05,433
19th-century technology.
Very basic.

408
00:18:05,434 --> 00:18:07,802
Does anybody know how to fix
an internal combustion engine?

409
00:18:07,803 --> 00:18:10,238
No. No.
Not a clue.

410
00:18:10,239 --> 00:18:13,374
Well, we'd better call somebody
to come pick us up.

411
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:16,244
It'd be swell
if they had a train.

412
00:18:21,650 --> 00:18:23,451
Thank you, Penny.

413
00:18:23,452 --> 00:18:25,820
No problem.

414
00:18:25,821 --> 00:18:27,355
So, Leonard,

415
00:18:27,356 --> 00:18:29,423
I think it's interesting
you didn't call your girlfriend

416
00:18:29,424 --> 00:18:30,625
to come get you.

417
00:18:30,626 --> 00:18:33,094
Uh, I kind of
told her I was working.

418
00:18:33,095 --> 00:18:34,929
So you lied to her.

419
00:18:34,930 --> 00:18:36,797
Also interesting.

420
00:18:36,798 --> 00:18:38,549
Yeah, she doesn't really
understand

421
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:41,502
the whole Warcraft
adventure-role-playing thing.

422
00:18:41,503 --> 00:18:45,172
Well, doesn't matter if she gets
it, as long as she's pretty.

423
00:18:46,341 --> 00:18:48,843
This one's funny, Leonard.

424
00:18:48,844 --> 00:18:51,279
How come you couldn't
make it work with her?

425
00:18:52,447 --> 00:18:55,049
So did you at least get
Sheldon's fake stuff back?

426
00:18:55,050 --> 00:18:58,352
No. We failed
in our noble quest.

427
00:18:58,353 --> 00:18:59,403
How come?

428
00:18:59,404 --> 00:19:02,957
Todd Zarnecki was mean.

429
00:19:02,958 --> 00:19:04,492
All right. Hang on.

430
00:19:04,493 --> 00:19:05,927
What are you doing?

431
00:19:05,928 --> 00:19:08,963
I'm gonna show you how we
finish a quest in Nebraska.

432
00:19:10,699 --> 00:19:13,668
Oh. Beyonce.

433
00:19:20,676 --> 00:19:22,476
This ain't no Beyonce.

434
00:19:26,415 --> 00:19:28,482
Now what?

435
00:19:29,585 --> 00:19:31,285
Give my friend his stuff back.

436
00:19:31,286 --> 00:19:33,154
I don't know
what you're talking about.

437
00:19:33,155 --> 00:19:34,622
Well, then, good news.

438
00:19:34,623 --> 00:19:36,657
Today's the day a girl's
finally going to touch you

439
00:19:36,658 --> 00:19:38,058
in your little special place.

440
00:19:41,330 --> 00:19:43,831
Now give him his stuff back.

441
00:19:43,832 --> 00:19:45,366
Okay.

442
00:19:45,367 --> 00:19:46,834
We did it!

443
00:19:48,570 --> 00:19:51,255
I said, "we."

444
00:19:57,481 --> 00:19:59,649
Oh, hold the door.

445
00:19:59,650 --> 00:20:01,317
Oh, hi.
Hi.

446
00:20:02,486 --> 00:20:03,719
Going to see Leonard?

447
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:05,688
Yes.

448
00:20:05,689 --> 00:20:07,039
How have you been?

449
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:08,424
Fine. You?

450
00:20:08,425 --> 00:20:10,626
Very well, thank you.
