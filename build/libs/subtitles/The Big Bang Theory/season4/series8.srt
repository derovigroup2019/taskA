00:00:15,738 --> 00:00:17,205
Okay, help me out here.

3
00:00:17,206 --> 00:00:20,842
How does an archeology professor
get that good with a whip?

4
00:00:20,843 --> 00:00:23,411
Maybe he took a class
at the adult bookstore.

5
00:00:23,412 --> 00:00:25,046
That's how I learned.

6
00:00:25,047 --> 00:00:27,849
I can't believe you've never
seen <i>Raiders of the Lost Ark.</i>

7
00:00:27,850 --> 00:00:31,653
And I can't believe you've
never read <i>Eat, Pray, Love.</i>

8
00:00:31,654 --> 00:00:33,121
When she comes out with

9
00:00:33,122 --> 00:00:35,857
<i>Eat, Pray, Run Away From A</i>
<i>Giant Boulder,</i> I'll read it.

10
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:40,862
I don't care if <i>Eat, Pray, Love</i>
changed your life,

11
00:00:40,863 --> 00:00:43,798
I'm not reading it.

12
00:00:43,799 --> 00:00:46,067
You know, I could totally
rock a hat like that.

13
00:00:46,068 --> 00:00:48,803
That's the work of noted
Hollywood costume designer

14
00:00:48,804 --> 00:00:49,904
Deborah Nadoolman.

15
00:00:49,905 --> 00:00:51,239
She also designed

16
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:52,574
the iconic red and black jacket

17
00:00:52,575 --> 00:00:54,442
in Michael Jackson's
<i>Thriller</i> video,

18
00:00:54,443 --> 00:00:56,411
which I've never viewed
in its entirety,

19
00:00:56,412 --> 00:00:57,796
as I find zombies dancing

20
00:00:57,797 --> 00:00:59,981
in choreographed synchronicity
implausible.

21
00:01:01,217 --> 00:01:04,586
And also, it's really scary.

22
00:01:04,587 --> 00:01:07,722
Would someone please turn off
the Sheldon commentary track?

23
00:01:07,723 --> 00:01:11,659
There's no switch.
Just listen and learn.

24
00:01:12,461 --> 00:01:14,062
Penny, if you think
this is good,

25
00:01:14,063 --> 00:01:15,263
you should come with us Friday

26
00:01:15,264 --> 00:01:17,399
to see it on the big screen
at the Colonial.

27
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:18,466
Well, I'm watching it now.

28
00:01:18,467 --> 00:01:19,968
Why would I want to see it again
on Friday?

29
00:01:19,969 --> 00:01:21,903
Because the print
they're showing on Friday

30
00:01:21,904 --> 00:01:26,191
has an additional 21 seconds
of previously unseen footage.

31
00:01:26,192 --> 00:01:30,879
21 seconds? That'll be like
seeing a whole new movie!

32
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:32,113
Exactly.

33
00:01:32,114 --> 00:01:33,948
They say it finally solves
the submarine controversy.

34
00:01:33,949 --> 00:01:35,984
Did-- Leonard?

35
00:01:35,985 --> 00:01:37,585
I'm no expert, but I believe

36
00:01:37,586 --> 00:01:39,504
what we just heard from Penny
was sarcasm.

37
00:01:40,856 --> 00:01:42,757
Oh! Good.

38
00:01:42,758 --> 00:01:44,426
I'm eight for 26 this month.

39
00:01:45,995 --> 00:01:47,061
Yeah, I think I'll pass.

40
00:01:47,062 --> 00:01:49,931
But you guys enjoy
your extra 21 seconds.

41
00:01:49,932 --> 00:01:51,399
Bet if I could
make you understand

42
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:53,735
why this is such a cool thing,
we'd still be together.

43
00:01:53,736 --> 00:01:57,238
Mm, yeah, no,
we wouldn't.

44
00:01:57,239 --> 00:01:58,640
Uh-huh.

45
00:01:58,641 --> 00:02:02,744
I'm guessing 21 seconds had
something to do with that, too.

46
00:02:06,582 --> 00:02:10,201
? Our whole universe
was in a hot, dense state ?

47
00:02:10,202 --> 00:02:13,538
? Then nearly 14 billion years
ago expansion started... Wait! ?

48
00:02:13,539 --> 00:02:15,189
? The Earth began to cool ?

49
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:17,759
? The autotrophs began to drool,
Neanderthals developed tools ?

50
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:20,428
? We built the Wall ?
? <i>We built the pyramids</i> ?

51
00:02:20,429 --> 00:02:23,064
? Math, Science, History,
unraveling the mystery ?

52
00:02:23,065 --> 00:02:24,966
? That all started
with a big bang ?

53
00:02:24,967 --> 00:02:26,935
? <i>Bang!</i> ?

54
00:02:27,135 --> 00:02:30,435

56
00:02:33,461 --> 00:02:34,928
May I point out to you all

57
00:02:34,929 --> 00:02:37,297
that the screening is
"first come, first served"?

58
00:02:37,298 --> 00:02:40,867
Relax, it's 5:00. The movie
doesn't start till midnight.

59
00:02:40,868 --> 00:02:43,237
Another way of saying that is

60
00:02:43,238 --> 00:02:45,372
"the movie starts at midnight,
and it's already 5:00."

61
00:02:45,373 --> 00:02:46,640
Let's go.

62
00:02:46,641 --> 00:02:48,875
You know, if we miss it,
we'll have the fun of

63
00:02:48,876 --> 00:02:52,229
listening to Sheldon whine about
it for the rest of our lives.

64
00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:55,082
See? Howard's on my side.

65
00:02:55,083 --> 00:02:56,717
Actually, I'm not.

66
00:02:56,718 --> 00:02:58,719
I'm using sarcasm to mock you.

67
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:02,573
Drat. Now I'm 8 for 27.

68
00:03:02,574 --> 00:03:04,541
Don't worry, Sheldon.
We'll be fine.

69
00:03:04,542 --> 00:03:06,493
What happened to
the Leonard Hofstadter

70
00:03:06,494 --> 00:03:08,862
who waited in line
with me for 14 hours

71
00:03:08,863 --> 00:03:11,197
to see the midnight premiere
of <i>Star Trek: Nemesis?</i>

72
00:03:11,198 --> 00:03:13,967
Oh. Well, he waited
in line for 14 hours,

73
00:03:13,968 --> 00:03:15,569
while you napped
in a lawn chair,

74
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:17,237
he got in a fight
with a Klingon

75
00:03:17,238 --> 00:03:18,939
when he stepped
out of line to pee

76
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:20,707
and you wouldn't wake up
to vouch for him,

77
00:03:20,708 --> 00:03:24,144
and worst of all,
he saw <i>Star Trek: Nemesis.</i>

78
00:03:24,145 --> 00:03:26,280
But how were our seats?

79
00:03:26,281 --> 00:03:27,347
Excellent.

80
00:03:27,348 --> 00:03:28,982
I rest my case.

81
00:03:28,983 --> 00:03:32,252
Amy, don't you agree we should
leave now and get in line?

82
00:03:33,688 --> 00:03:36,156
Actually, as the newest member
of your social group,

83
00:03:36,157 --> 00:03:38,292
I believe I'll gain more
acceptance by arbitrarily

84
00:03:38,293 --> 00:03:40,661
siding with your friends
from time to time.

85
00:03:40,662 --> 00:03:43,664
Shrewd.

86
00:03:43,665 --> 00:03:46,133
Leonard, you're right.

87
00:03:46,134 --> 00:03:48,168
We should enjoy our meal,
arrive late,

88
00:03:48,169 --> 00:03:49,870
and risk winding up
with terrible seats,

89
00:03:49,871 --> 00:03:51,972
assuming we get in at all.

90
00:03:51,973 --> 00:03:53,674
Thank you, Amy.

91
00:03:53,675 --> 00:03:57,177
See? It's working.

92
00:03:57,178 --> 00:03:59,212
Knock-knock.

93
00:03:59,213 --> 00:04:00,263
Who's there?

94
00:04:00,264 --> 00:04:01,281
Olive.

95
00:04:01,282 --> 00:04:04,250
Olive you, too.

96
00:04:04,251 --> 00:04:06,653
Guys, that's really
starting to get old.

97
00:04:06,654 --> 00:04:07,771
Knock-knock.

98
00:04:07,772 --> 00:04:08,822
Who's there?

99
00:04:08,823 --> 00:04:11,658
I have a girlfriend
and you don't.

100
00:04:11,659 --> 00:04:13,777
Hysterical!

101
00:04:13,778 --> 00:04:15,896
Wait, now, we don't know
that yet. He isn't finished.

102
00:04:15,897 --> 00:04:18,765
I have a girlfriend
and you don't <i>who?</i>

103
00:04:18,766 --> 00:04:22,903
So. Are you sure you don't want
to come with us to <i>Raiders?</i>

104
00:04:22,904 --> 00:04:25,906
Oh, no. That movie
has melting faces.

105
00:04:25,907 --> 00:04:27,541
It reminds me
too much of the time

106
00:04:27,542 --> 00:04:29,643
I dropped that vial of
flesh-eating bacteria

107
00:04:29,644 --> 00:04:31,144
into the Rhesus monkey lab.

108
00:04:33,681 --> 00:04:35,982
Besides, Penny and I are having
a girls' night tonight.

109
00:04:35,983 --> 00:04:38,151
Girls' night?
What does that entail?

110
00:04:38,152 --> 00:04:39,786
Oh, you know, girls get
together,

111
00:04:39,787 --> 00:04:41,521
hang out, share girl talk.

112
00:04:42,357 --> 00:04:44,358
I'm a girl.

113
00:04:44,359 --> 00:04:48,895
Oh. Well, maybe you can join us.
I'll ask Penny.

114
00:04:48,896 --> 00:04:51,848
No need. Penny and I
are very close.

115
00:04:51,849 --> 00:04:53,500
You are?

116
00:04:53,501 --> 00:04:56,203
Yes. In fact,
our menses are synchronized.

117
00:05:01,442 --> 00:05:03,160
Penny.

118
00:05:03,161 --> 00:05:05,045
Bernadette tells me you're
planning a girls' night.

119
00:05:05,046 --> 00:05:06,079
Yeah?

120
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:08,949
I'm a girl.

121
00:05:08,950 --> 00:05:11,618
Oh. Um, it was-- it was just
going to be me and Bernadette.

122
00:05:11,619 --> 00:05:13,520
Besides, I thought you
were going to the movies

123
00:05:13,521 --> 00:05:14,621
with Sheldon and the guys.

124
00:05:14,622 --> 00:05:16,022
Yes, but they're not girls.

125
00:05:16,023 --> 00:05:18,058
I'm a girl.

126
00:05:18,059 --> 00:05:22,295
Yeah, no, no,
I-I-I got that.

127
00:05:22,296 --> 00:05:23,663
What's the dress code?

128
00:05:23,664 --> 00:05:25,665
Uh, just wear something
comfortable.

129
00:05:25,666 --> 00:05:29,636
All right.
I'll have to go shopping.

130
00:05:30,571 --> 00:05:32,472
Knock-knock.

131
00:05:32,473 --> 00:05:33,507
Who is there?

132
00:05:33,508 --> 00:05:35,075
Hugh.
Hugh who?

133
00:05:35,076 --> 00:05:38,044
Hugh people need to
listen to me.

134
00:05:42,116 --> 00:05:45,518
It's time to get
in line for the movie.

135
00:05:45,519 --> 00:05:47,370
And that's how you tell
a knock-knock joke.

136
00:05:50,908 --> 00:05:56,696
Under normal circumstances
I'd say, "I told you so."

137
00:05:56,697 --> 00:05:58,865
But as I have told you so

138
00:05:58,866 --> 00:06:00,634
with such vehemence
and frequency already,

139
00:06:00,635 --> 00:06:03,470
the phrase has lost all meaning.

140
00:06:03,471 --> 00:06:06,139
Therefore, I will be
replacing it with the phrase:

141
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:08,425
"I informed you thusly."

142
00:06:08,426 --> 00:06:11,311
Ooh. Can't wait
for that to start.

143
00:06:11,312 --> 00:06:13,563
I informed you thusly.

144
00:06:13,564 --> 00:06:17,150
Eight for 28.

145
00:06:17,151 --> 00:06:20,937
This is where we could have been
if we hadn't stopped for dinner.

146
00:06:20,938 --> 00:06:23,106
This is where we could have been

147
00:06:23,107 --> 00:06:25,425
if Koothrappali
hadn't ordered dessert.

148
00:06:25,426 --> 00:06:27,577
Well I earned it, dude,
I ate all my broccoli.

149
00:06:27,578 --> 00:06:32,749
And here's where we are.
The runts in a large litter.

150
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:34,367
unlikely to ever reach

151
00:06:34,368 --> 00:06:38,438
the nourishing teats
of Indiana Jones.

152
00:06:38,439 --> 00:06:41,541
So I guess it's a good thing
we stopped for dinner.

153
00:06:43,711 --> 00:06:46,296
You know, guys, when
facing disappointment,

154
00:06:46,297 --> 00:06:47,580
<i>Eat, Pray, Love</i>  teaches us--

155
00:06:47,581 --> 00:06:50,300
Oh, shut up.

156
00:06:51,486 --> 00:06:53,820
...so anyway, to make
a long story short,

157
00:06:53,821 --> 00:06:57,557
turns out I have
an unusually firm cervix.

158
00:06:59,594 --> 00:07:02,762
You--
Amy, when we say "girl talk,"

159
00:07:02,763 --> 00:07:06,600
it doesn't just have to
be about our lady parts.

160
00:07:06,601 --> 00:07:11,638
Shame. 'Cause I have a real
zinger about my titled uterus.

161
00:07:15,776 --> 00:07:18,612
Penny, your nails
look great.

162
00:07:18,613 --> 00:07:21,915
Oh, thanks. I found
this place in Alhambra.

163
00:07:21,916 --> 00:07:23,283
It's in a woman's basement.

164
00:07:23,284 --> 00:07:25,685
I think it's a front
for human trafficking,

165
00:07:25,686 --> 00:07:27,787
but they do a really good job.

166
00:07:29,190 --> 00:07:31,591
A colleague of mine did her
graduate thesis on the fungus

167
00:07:31,592 --> 00:07:34,227
that grows on improperly
sterilized manicure implements.

168
00:07:35,496 --> 00:07:38,365
Well don't tell me
that's not "girl talk."

169
00:07:38,366 --> 00:07:41,318
So where should
we go tonight?

170
00:07:41,319 --> 00:07:43,503
A bar? A club? A movie?

171
00:07:43,504 --> 00:07:45,171
Or we could just stay here.

172
00:07:45,172 --> 00:07:46,740
Yes, and continue to bond.

173
00:07:46,741 --> 00:07:48,475
I have a feeling
that after tonight,

174
00:07:48,476 --> 00:07:51,011
one of you will become
my best friend forever.

175
00:07:51,012 --> 00:07:54,014
Or "BFF," if you prefer.

176
00:07:54,015 --> 00:07:55,348
Which I don't.

177
00:07:55,349 --> 00:07:59,586
All right, time to open
Bachelor Number Two.

178
00:07:59,587 --> 00:08:01,955
Gee, I don't know
if I should drink more.

179
00:08:01,956 --> 00:08:04,124
I have to drive home,
and I've got enough trouble

180
00:08:04,125 --> 00:08:06,960
seeing over the dashboard
as it is.

181
00:08:06,961 --> 00:08:10,263
That's okay.
You can just sleep here.

182
00:08:10,264 --> 00:08:12,566
Oh, good, a slumber party!

183
00:08:12,567 --> 00:08:14,935
We'll do makeovers,
initiate phony phone calls,

184
00:08:14,936 --> 00:08:17,971
and have spirited pillow fights
in our frilly nighties!

185
00:08:17,972 --> 00:08:19,506
Oh, gosh, Amy.

186
00:08:19,507 --> 00:08:21,975
I don't know if I would call
this an actual slumber party.

187
00:08:21,976 --> 00:08:23,276
Well, that's disappointing.

188
00:08:23,277 --> 00:08:25,078
I've always wanted to be
invited to a slumber party.

189
00:08:25,079 --> 00:08:26,546
Oh, you never were?

190
00:08:26,547 --> 00:08:28,014
Not even when
you were a kid?

191
00:08:28,015 --> 00:08:30,550
Well, there was the time
I had my tonsils out,

192
00:08:30,551 --> 00:08:33,286
and I shared a room with
a little Vietnamese girl.

193
00:08:34,455 --> 00:08:35,822
She didn't make it
through the night,

194
00:08:35,823 --> 00:08:37,991
but up till then,
it was kind of fun.

195
00:08:40,628 --> 00:08:43,630
Okay. Well, I guess we're
having a slumber party.

196
00:08:43,631 --> 00:08:44,998
Oh!

197
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:48,902
Pillow fight!

198
00:08:51,572 --> 00:08:54,240
Oh, I hope they
let us in soon.

199
00:08:54,241 --> 00:08:56,676
I'm tired of running to the gas
station to use the bathroom.

200
00:08:56,677 --> 00:08:59,980
The guy makes me buy
a Gatorade every time.

201
00:08:59,981 --> 00:09:01,281
It's a vicious circle.

202
00:09:01,282 --> 00:09:05,352
Too bad you don't have
a stadium pal like me.

203
00:09:05,353 --> 00:09:06,720
What's a stadium pal?

204
00:09:06,721 --> 00:09:08,254
Let me put it this way:

205
00:09:08,255 --> 00:09:10,123
takes care of
the bathroom problem,

206
00:09:10,124 --> 00:09:11,858
and it keeps your calf warm.

207
00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:16,129
Hey, guys, bad news.
I just did a quick calculation.

208
00:09:16,130 --> 00:09:18,698
Given the size of the theater
and the length of this line,

209
00:09:18,699 --> 00:09:20,600
we might not get seats.

210
00:09:21,502 --> 00:09:23,737
What did he say?

211
00:09:23,738 --> 00:09:24,938
Nice going, Raj.

212
00:09:24,939 --> 00:09:26,940
Just got him down for his nap.

213
00:09:28,242 --> 00:09:30,243
We might not get seats?!

214
00:09:30,244 --> 00:09:31,577
It's fine, it's fine.
Go back to sleep.

215
00:09:31,578 --> 00:09:35,298
Oh, I informed you thusly!
I so informed you thusly.

216
00:09:35,299 --> 00:09:38,018
Howard, you talk to him.

217
00:09:38,019 --> 00:09:39,185
Howard?

218
00:09:41,389 --> 00:09:43,023
You're peeing,
aren't you?

219
00:09:44,992 --> 00:09:46,292
Hey, look who's here!

220
00:09:46,293 --> 00:09:48,061
Hey, buddies!

221
00:09:48,062 --> 00:09:49,479
Well, if it isn't Wil Wheaton,

222
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:53,600
the Jar Jar Binks
of the <i>Star Trek</i> universe.

223
00:09:53,601 --> 00:09:57,337
Mee-sa think that very funny!

224
00:09:57,338 --> 00:10:01,174
Well, you-sa can go think that
at the back of the line.

225
00:10:01,175 --> 00:10:03,743
No cuts, no buts, no coconuts.

226
00:10:04,779 --> 00:10:05,795
Wil Wheaton.

227
00:10:05,796 --> 00:10:06,830
Yeah.

228
00:10:06,831 --> 00:10:07,797
I'm a big fan.

229
00:10:07,798 --> 00:10:11,451
Of what? Poorly
executed beards?

230
00:10:11,452 --> 00:10:13,520
Do you think you could get me
and my friends into the movie?

231
00:10:13,521 --> 00:10:14,788
We got here
a little late.

232
00:10:14,789 --> 00:10:16,622
No problem. Come on,
I'll hook you up.

233
00:10:16,623 --> 00:10:17,807
Awesome.

234
00:10:19,126 --> 00:10:22,595
We-sa gonna go into
the movie now! Bye-bye!

235
00:10:24,648 --> 00:10:28,768
This is <i>Indiana</i> Jones,
not <i>Star Trek.</i>

236
00:10:28,769 --> 00:10:32,105
There should be no value
to his pseudo-celebrity here!

237
00:10:32,106 --> 00:10:33,873
And even at
Star Trek conventions,

238
00:10:33,874 --> 00:10:36,676
they only let him in
if he helps set up!

239
00:10:36,677 --> 00:10:38,344
Calm down, Sheldon.

240
00:10:38,345 --> 00:10:39,779
I will not calm down.

241
00:10:39,780 --> 00:10:42,782
This affront to justice and
decency cannot go unanswered.

242
00:10:42,783 --> 00:10:45,618
As Captain Jean-Luc Picard
once said,

243
00:10:45,619 --> 00:10:48,705
"The line must be drawn here!

244
00:10:48,706 --> 00:10:52,792
"This far, no farther!"

245
00:10:52,793 --> 00:10:56,429
Had to wake him up
from his nap, didn't you?

246
00:10:59,552 --> 00:11:01,653
You know what I really love
about Howard?

247
00:11:01,654 --> 00:11:03,638
His chest hair.

248
00:11:04,974 --> 00:11:07,108
Howard has a
hairy chest?

249
00:11:07,109 --> 00:11:09,311
No, just the one.

250
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:12,747
But it's really long.

251
00:11:14,534 --> 00:11:17,786
Okay, there you go--
Sultry Sunrise Red.

252
00:11:17,787 --> 00:11:19,387
What do you think?

253
00:11:19,388 --> 00:11:22,157
My nails have never
looked so pretty before.

254
00:11:22,158 --> 00:11:24,326
Get it off.

255
00:11:26,529 --> 00:11:28,146
Oh, oh, uh, looks like
they're getting ready

256
00:11:28,147 --> 00:11:29,381
to let people in.

257
00:11:29,382 --> 00:11:32,434
Listen to what Mr. Wil
Wheaton is tweeting.

258
00:11:32,435 --> 00:11:36,304
"Best seats in house
for <i>Raiders</i> screening.

259
00:11:36,305 --> 00:11:39,441
Suck on that, Sheldon Cooper."

260
00:11:39,442 --> 00:11:41,209
Why do you read
his Twitter feed?

261
00:11:41,210 --> 00:11:43,061
You know it's only
going to upset you.

262
00:11:43,062 --> 00:11:45,413
I believe in knowing
my enemy, Leonard.

263
00:11:45,414 --> 00:11:48,767
Had Twitter existed at the time,
would not General Custer

264
00:11:48,768 --> 00:11:51,052
have followed the tweets
of Sitting Bull?

265
00:11:51,053 --> 00:11:53,488
Would not Lee have
followed Grant?

266
00:11:53,489 --> 00:11:56,057
Would not Spy have followed Spy?

267
00:11:57,460 --> 00:11:59,728
I have more examples,
but excuse me.

268
00:11:59,729 --> 00:12:01,396
Hello.

269
00:12:01,397 --> 00:12:03,798
Well, this seems
like an odd time

270
00:12:03,799 --> 00:12:07,369
to test my cell phone quality,
but go on.

271
00:12:07,370 --> 00:12:09,804
Test phrases? All right.

272
00:12:10,606 --> 00:12:12,541
Imatote.

273
00:12:12,542 --> 00:12:14,576
Ulba.

274
00:12:14,577 --> 00:12:16,344
Twad.

275
00:12:17,213 --> 00:12:18,914
All together?

276
00:12:18,915 --> 00:12:21,383
I'm a total buttwad.

277
00:12:23,719 --> 00:12:25,887
Why are you laughing?

278
00:12:27,123 --> 00:12:29,157
Hello?

279
00:12:29,158 --> 00:12:32,027
And that, girls, is how you make
a phony phone call.

280
00:12:33,729 --> 00:12:34,963
I'm not sure I grasp

281
00:12:34,964 --> 00:12:37,566
the full entertainment value,
but all right.

282
00:12:38,701 --> 00:12:41,002
Next on Wikipedia's list
of slumber party activities:

283
00:12:41,003 --> 00:12:42,287
"Truth or Dare."

284
00:12:42,288 --> 00:12:43,939
Okay, it's your game.
You go first.

285
00:12:43,940 --> 00:12:47,409
Hang on. I'm familiarizing
myself with the rules.

286
00:12:47,410 --> 00:12:50,111
Seems fairly straightforward.

287
00:12:50,112 --> 00:12:52,380
Bernadette, truth or dare?

288
00:12:52,381 --> 00:12:53,949
Truth.
All right.

289
00:12:53,950 --> 00:12:56,451
To what temperature
must you heat beef

290
00:12:56,452 --> 00:12:58,053
in order to
kill the prion

291
00:12:58,054 --> 00:13:00,689
that causes bovine
spongiform encephalopathy?

292
00:13:00,690 --> 00:13:02,324
Um...

293
00:13:02,325 --> 00:13:05,026
Remember, you have
to answer honestly.

294
00:13:05,027 --> 00:13:07,295
Wait. No, Amy, you're
supposed to ask her

295
00:13:07,296 --> 00:13:08,697
something personal
or embarrassing.

296
00:13:08,698 --> 00:13:10,031
Oh.

297
00:13:10,032 --> 00:13:11,299
All right.

298
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:14,235
What is the circumference
of your areolas?

299
00:13:20,576 --> 00:13:23,578
"Munching on
complimentary popcorn.

300
00:13:23,579 --> 00:13:24,913
Woot, woot."

301
00:13:24,914 --> 00:13:26,247
Oh, the gall.

302
00:13:26,248 --> 00:13:30,168
I hope his next tweet is
"Popcorn lodged in trachea.

303
00:13:30,169 --> 00:13:32,220
"Choking to death.

304
00:13:32,221 --> 00:13:34,122
Woot, woot."

305
00:13:34,924 --> 00:13:37,325
Guys, I am sorry.
We are full up.

306
00:13:37,326 --> 00:13:38,727
No!

307
00:13:38,728 --> 00:13:39,994
We're full up.

308
00:13:39,995 --> 00:13:41,429
We really want
to see this.

309
00:13:41,430 --> 00:13:43,765
Isn't there anything
you can do?

310
00:13:43,766 --> 00:13:45,834
Sorry. Fire regulations.
Should've gotten here earlier.

311
00:13:45,835 --> 00:13:48,670
This is nothing but a
blatant abuse of power

312
00:13:48,671 --> 00:13:50,338
by a petty functionary.

313
00:13:50,339 --> 00:13:52,807
Explain to me why
Wil Wheaton and his lackeys

314
00:13:52,808 --> 00:13:54,509
get in and we don't.

315
00:13:54,510 --> 00:13:58,346
'Cause I'm the petty functionary
with a clipboard, bitch.

316
00:14:00,650 --> 00:14:02,350
I guess that's that.

317
00:14:03,219 --> 00:14:05,019
Let's go home.

318
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:06,037
You know what?

319
00:14:06,038 --> 00:14:07,656
I'm going back to
"I told you so."

320
00:14:07,657 --> 00:14:08,907
I told you so.

321
00:14:10,159 --> 00:14:11,543
We can still see something.

322
00:14:11,544 --> 00:14:14,245
Oh, the new Sandra Bullock movie
is playing two blocks away.

323
00:14:14,246 --> 00:14:16,765
You know Sandy B.
always brings it.

324
00:14:16,766 --> 00:14:19,200
Look-- a side door.

325
00:14:19,201 --> 00:14:20,769
Come on, Short Round.

326
00:14:21,971 --> 00:14:23,805
I guess we'd better
go after him.

327
00:14:23,806 --> 00:14:25,206
Short Round?

328
00:14:25,207 --> 00:14:26,925
Indy's young sidekick
from <i>Temple of Doom.</i>

329
00:14:26,926 --> 00:14:29,477
Yeah, I know who it
is, but why is it me?

330
00:14:29,478 --> 00:14:31,713
You're right. It should
be a cuddly Asian boy.

331
00:14:31,714 --> 00:14:33,881
Like me.

332
00:14:34,984 --> 00:14:37,419
"And Absolon hath
kist hir nether ye,

333
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:39,454
"and Nicholas is scalded
in the towte.

334
00:14:39,455 --> 00:14:43,425
This tale is doon,
and God save al the rowte."

335
00:14:47,730 --> 00:14:49,764
What the hell was that?

336
00:14:49,765 --> 00:14:52,634
Bernadette dared me to
tell a dirty story.

337
00:14:52,635 --> 00:14:56,137
"The Miller's Tale" by Chaucer
is the dirtiest story I know.

338
00:14:57,306 --> 00:14:59,007
It would have been hidden
in sock drawers

339
00:14:59,008 --> 00:15:02,644
if people in the 14th century
had worn socks.

340
00:15:02,645 --> 00:15:05,046
I thought it was pretty spicy.

341
00:15:05,047 --> 00:15:08,950
Especially the part
where he kisses her nether ye.

342
00:15:08,951 --> 00:15:10,618
You might not
like it as much

343
00:15:10,619 --> 00:15:12,253
if you knew what
"nether ye" meant.

344
00:15:12,254 --> 00:15:14,289
if one cares
about hygiene,

345
00:15:14,290 --> 00:15:16,825
one ought not be kissing it.

346
00:15:18,260 --> 00:15:19,794
Okay, my turn.

347
00:15:19,795 --> 00:15:21,396
Penny, truth or dare?

348
00:15:21,397 --> 00:15:22,614
Truth.

349
00:15:22,615 --> 00:15:24,966
Why are you still hanging out
with Leonard so much

350
00:15:24,967 --> 00:15:26,468
even though you broke up
with him?

351
00:15:26,469 --> 00:15:28,870
Oh, that's an
excellent question.

352
00:15:28,871 --> 00:15:31,239
For two people who claim to be
no longer pair-bonded,

353
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:33,675
you spend an inordinate amount
of time in each other's company.

354
00:15:33,676 --> 00:15:35,543
Yeah.

355
00:15:37,379 --> 00:15:39,614
Dare.

356
00:15:40,950 --> 00:15:42,150
I don't believe the rules allow

357
00:15:42,151 --> 00:15:44,052
for an ex post facto
option change.

358
00:15:44,053 --> 00:15:45,854
Yeah.

359
00:15:47,656 --> 00:15:50,391
Okay, look, just because we're
not seeing each other anymore

360
00:15:50,392 --> 00:15:52,060
doesn't mean
we can't be friends.

361
00:15:52,061 --> 00:15:53,862
I mean, Leonard's a great guy.

362
00:15:53,863 --> 00:15:56,064
Then, why did you terminate
your relationship with him?

363
00:15:56,065 --> 00:15:57,432
I don't know.

364
00:15:57,433 --> 00:16:00,301
He got really serious,
and I wasn't ready for it.

365
00:16:00,302 --> 00:16:01,636
Interesting.

366
00:16:01,637 --> 00:16:03,304
How will you react
if, in the future,

367
00:16:03,305 --> 00:16:05,406
you become ready for it,
and Leonard is unavailable,

368
00:16:05,407 --> 00:16:07,542
because another woman
has realized that he is--

369
00:16:07,543 --> 00:16:09,978
to use your words--
"a great guy"?

370
00:16:11,747 --> 00:16:14,282
You can only ask one question.

371
00:16:15,284 --> 00:16:17,552
That one.

372
00:16:18,788 --> 00:16:21,222
You know what,
I don't want to play anymore.

373
00:16:27,897 --> 00:16:29,831
Well, I'm not sure
how this is scored,

374
00:16:29,832 --> 00:16:32,467
but I believe
we may have won.

375
00:16:36,238 --> 00:16:38,106
Sheldon?

376
00:16:39,175 --> 00:16:40,608
Sheldon?

377
00:16:40,609 --> 00:16:42,009
Where did he go?

378
00:16:44,613 --> 00:16:48,183
We're looking for Sheldon,
not Marmaduke.

379
00:16:49,018 --> 00:16:52,186
You whistled?

380
00:16:52,187 --> 00:16:53,488
What is that?

381
00:16:53,489 --> 00:16:55,022
<i>Raiders of the Lost Ark</i>

382
00:16:55,023 --> 00:16:57,024
with 21 additional seconds.

383
00:16:58,527 --> 00:17:01,129
If I can't see it,
no one else can see it.

384
00:17:01,130 --> 00:17:02,964
Sheldon, this is crazy.

385
00:17:02,965 --> 00:17:06,668
No. Crazy was leaving
the projection booth unattended.

386
00:17:06,669 --> 00:17:07,919
Listen to me.

387
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:09,337
You are over-tired.
You're not thinking right.

388
00:17:09,338 --> 00:17:11,973
Put the movie back
before we get into trouble.

389
00:17:11,974 --> 00:17:14,042
Trouble is my middle name,
Leonard.

390
00:17:14,043 --> 00:17:16,845
Actually, it's Lee,
but I prefer Trouble.

391
00:17:16,846 --> 00:17:20,315
Oh, look who
they let in.

392
00:17:20,316 --> 00:17:24,218
Don't worry, Wil Wheaton.
I was just leaving.

393
00:17:28,290 --> 00:17:29,824
Come on, Short Round.

394
00:17:29,825 --> 00:17:31,659
Yeah.

395
00:17:34,964 --> 00:17:37,198
Come on, guys!
Hurry up! Hurry up!

396
00:17:37,199 --> 00:17:38,333
Let's see you run

397
00:17:38,334 --> 00:17:40,768
with a bag of urine
strapped to your leg.

398
00:17:40,769 --> 00:17:43,338
He's got the movie! Get him!

399
00:17:48,794 --> 00:17:52,814
Why is there never a pontoon
plane when you need one?

400
00:18:03,822 --> 00:18:05,823
She's been in there
a long time.

401
00:18:05,824 --> 00:18:08,725
Clearly, losing Truth or Dare
upset her.

402
00:18:08,726 --> 00:18:11,712
Perhaps we should try
to take her mind off it

403
00:18:11,713 --> 00:18:13,697
with another popular
slumber party activity.

404
00:18:13,698 --> 00:18:15,766
Ooh, like what?
Well, the Internet suggests

405
00:18:15,767 --> 00:18:18,135
that slumber party guests
often engage

406
00:18:18,136 --> 00:18:20,237
in harmless experimentation
with lesbianism.

407
00:18:23,107 --> 00:18:25,976
Where exactly on the Internet
have you been looking?

408
00:18:27,378 --> 00:18:29,546
Penny?
Oh, hey, Amy.

409
00:18:29,547 --> 00:18:31,715
Look, I'm sorry I got
so upset. I just...

410
00:18:31,716 --> 00:18:33,584
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

411
00:18:34,419 --> 00:18:36,086
What are you doing?

412
00:18:36,087 --> 00:18:38,455
Don't worry. I'll
avoid the nether ye.

413
00:18:39,524 --> 00:18:40,908
I might have gone
with eating raw cookie dough.
