1
00:00:02,141 --> 00:00:03,624
Ma, Ma, calm down.

2
00:00:03,817 --> 00:00:04,585
Listen to me.

3
00:00:04,652 --> 00:00:06,419
I know it says click
with the mouse,

4
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:09,089
but on a laptop,
the trackpad is the mouse.

5
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:11,624
Now, put your finger on it.

6
00:00:11,625 --> 00:00:14,260
Doesn't matter which finger.

7
00:00:14,261 --> 00:00:16,296
Good choice.

8
00:00:16,297 --> 00:00:20,200
Now move it down
to your e-mail icon.

9
00:00:20,201 --> 00:00:22,068
Yeah, the little envelope.

10
00:00:22,069 --> 00:00:24,504
What do you mean,
"What does it look like?"

11
00:00:24,505 --> 00:00:26,573
It looks like an envelope!

12
00:00:26,574 --> 00:00:28,241
Fine, you don't like
the computer,

13
00:00:28,242 --> 00:00:30,043
don't use it!

14
00:00:30,044 --> 00:00:33,580
Sure, we can exchange it
for a salad spinner. Good-bye!

15
00:00:36,083 --> 00:00:39,919
That's a Hanukkah present
you're regretting, huh?

16
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:42,489
I won't say that
all senior citizens

17
00:00:42,490 --> 00:00:46,159
who can't master technology
should be publicly flogged,

18
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:48,661
but if we made an
example of one or two,

19
00:00:48,662 --> 00:00:51,097
it might give the others
incentive to try harder.

20
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,134
I had a great idea.

21
00:00:54,135 --> 00:00:55,602
You know how
we're always having

22
00:00:55,603 --> 00:00:57,504
to stop and solve
differential equations,

23
00:00:57,505 --> 00:00:59,356
like when you're doing
Fourier analysis,

24
00:00:59,357 --> 00:01:01,674
or using the
Schrodinger equation?

25
00:01:01,675 --> 00:01:03,893
Howard doesn't.
He's only an engineer.

26
00:01:05,279 --> 00:01:08,381
I was thinking,
we could write a little app

27
00:01:08,382 --> 00:01:10,083
that would use
handwriting recognition,

28
00:01:10,084 --> 00:01:12,352
and then run it through a
symbolic evaluation engine.

29
00:01:12,353 --> 00:01:13,653
You just use your smartphone,

30
00:01:13,654 --> 00:01:16,823
take a picture
of the equation and bam!

31
00:01:16,824 --> 00:01:20,927
You know what's a great app?
The one that makes fart noises.

32
00:01:24,632 --> 00:01:26,733
You know, Leonard,

33
00:01:26,734 --> 00:01:28,501
that's actually
a valid idea.

34
00:01:28,502 --> 00:01:29,936
Very good.

35
00:01:29,937 --> 00:01:33,440
Can you say that and not
make it sound like I'm a cat

36
00:01:33,441 --> 00:01:36,176
who learned
how to use the toilet?

37
00:01:36,177 --> 00:01:38,044
No.

38
00:01:38,045 --> 00:01:40,013
The two achievements
are equally surprising

39
00:01:40,014 --> 00:01:41,481
and equally admirable,

40
00:01:41,482 --> 00:01:42,782
though if pressed,

41
00:01:42,783 --> 00:01:45,218
I'd have to give
a slight edge to the cat.

42
00:01:45,219 --> 00:01:47,020
I'll save you the pain
and nervousness

43
00:01:47,021 --> 00:01:48,388
of waiting for the answer.

44
00:01:48,389 --> 00:01:52,525
I agree to be part of
your project. Congratulations.

45
00:01:52,526 --> 00:01:54,594
Oh, yay for me.

46
00:01:54,595 --> 00:01:57,280
What about you guys?

47
00:01:57,281 --> 00:01:58,415
I can't promise anything,

48
00:01:58,416 --> 00:02:00,700
but people do make money
off stuff like this.

49
00:02:00,701 --> 00:02:02,118
A few extra bucks
would be nice.

50
00:02:02,119 --> 00:02:04,070
I could finally move out
of my mother's house.

51
00:02:04,071 --> 00:02:05,338
Where would you go?

52
00:02:05,339 --> 00:02:07,941
I always dreamed about building
a little place of my own

53
00:02:07,942 --> 00:02:09,809
over the garage.

54
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:13,313
You know, if I made more money,
I could take time off from work

55
00:02:13,314 --> 00:02:15,248
and give pretty girls
submarine rides.

56
00:02:15,249 --> 00:02:16,483
What's that?

57
00:02:16,484 --> 00:02:18,818
Some weird sex thing?

58
00:02:18,819 --> 00:02:20,320
No.

59
00:02:20,321 --> 00:02:21,988
You take pretty girls underwater

60
00:02:21,989 --> 00:02:24,257
in your private submarine,
and you show them fish.

61
00:02:24,258 --> 00:02:27,961
Why does everything
have to be dirty with you?

62
00:02:27,962 --> 00:02:30,363
I was thinking we could work
on this at night,

63
00:02:30,364 --> 00:02:32,332
and then maybe
in a couple of weeks,

64
00:02:32,333 --> 00:02:34,033
we'll have ourselves an app
to sell.

65
00:02:34,034 --> 00:02:35,301
Sounds like
we're in business.

66
00:02:35,302 --> 00:02:37,904
I think we should take a picture
to capture this moment.

67
00:02:37,905 --> 00:02:39,706
Yeah.
Oh!

68
00:02:43,944 --> 00:02:48,281
Was that the best 99 cents
I ever spent, or what?

69
00:02:48,282 --> 00:02:51,918
? Our whole universe
was in a hot, dense state ?

70
00:02:51,919 --> 00:02:55,255
? Then nearly 14 billion years
ago expansion started... Wait! ?

71
00:02:55,256 --> 00:02:56,973
? The Earth began to cool ?

72
00:02:56,974 --> 00:02:59,759
? The autotrophs began to drool,
Neanderthals developed tools ?

73
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:02,128
? We built the Wall ?
? <i>We built the pyramids</i> ?

74
00:03:02,129 --> 00:03:04,764
? Math, Science, History,
unraveling the mystery ?

75
00:03:04,765 --> 00:03:06,649
? That all started
with a big bang ?

76
00:03:06,650 --> 00:03:07,653
? <i>Bang!</i> ?

77
00:03:07,653 --> 00:03:11,153

79
00:03:14,505 --> 00:03:15,556
I checked the
App Store.

80
00:03:15,655 --> 00:03:16,888
No one is doing

81
00:03:16,889 --> 00:03:19,274
handwriting-recognition
differential equation solving.

82
00:03:19,275 --> 00:03:21,960
Oh, dear Lord, shush.

83
00:03:21,961 --> 00:03:23,762
What?

84
00:03:23,763 --> 00:03:26,331
You have so few good ideas,
Leonard.

85
00:03:26,332 --> 00:03:28,233
And you're just going
to spill the beans

86
00:03:28,234 --> 00:03:30,836
in front of an outsider?

87
00:03:35,908 --> 00:03:37,876
Who, me?

88
00:03:37,877 --> 00:03:40,095
Sheldon, I don't think
Penny cares

89
00:03:40,096 --> 00:03:42,080
about handwriting-recognition
based differential...

90
00:03:42,081 --> 00:03:44,966
? The stars at night
are big and bright ?

91
00:03:44,967 --> 00:03:47,786
? Deep in the heart
of Texas... ?

92
00:03:47,787 --> 00:03:50,155
She's not going
to steal our idea.

93
00:03:50,156 --> 00:03:52,057
What idea?
We're gonna write an application...

94
00:03:52,058 --> 00:03:54,109
? The prairie sky
is wide and high ?

95
00:03:54,110 --> 00:03:55,494
? Deep in the heart... ?

96
00:03:55,495 --> 00:03:56,611
Okay, stop, stop!

97
00:03:56,612 --> 00:03:59,281
? Of Texas. ?

98
00:03:59,282 --> 00:04:00,615
Whatever your secret is,

99
00:04:00,616 --> 00:04:02,717
I'm sure it's boring,
so I'm not interested.

100
00:04:02,718 --> 00:04:04,336
It's not boring at all.

101
00:04:04,337 --> 00:04:05,937
You see,
in higher order mathematics,

102
00:04:05,938 --> 00:04:07,139
there are certain sets

103
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:08,907
of equations that...
Bored.

104
00:04:08,908 --> 00:04:10,959
Satisfied?

105
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,277
Hardly.

106
00:04:12,278 --> 00:04:14,980
Consider this unlikely
but very plausible scenario.

107
00:04:14,981 --> 00:04:17,716
A young woman alone
in the big city.

108
00:04:17,717 --> 00:04:19,117
Her ridiculous dream

109
00:04:19,118 --> 00:04:21,920
of becoming an actress
lies shattered about her.

110
00:04:21,921 --> 00:04:23,488
Hey, wait a minute.

111
00:04:23,489 --> 00:04:25,457
Well, hang on. Let's
see where he's going.

112
00:04:25,458 --> 00:04:26,892
Then it hits her.

113
00:04:26,893 --> 00:04:28,660
How is she going to survive?

114
00:04:28,661 --> 00:04:32,180
I mean, she has no prospects,
no marketable skills.

115
00:04:32,181 --> 00:04:33,648
And then one day,

116
00:04:33,649 --> 00:04:35,767
she meets a group of geniuses

117
00:04:35,768 --> 00:04:37,702
and their friend Howard.

118
00:04:39,605 --> 00:04:41,573
Hey, I...

119
00:04:41,574 --> 00:04:43,542
Hang on.
Let's see where he's going.

120
00:04:45,144 --> 00:04:47,279
She befriends them,
and then lies in wait

121
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:49,915
until they reveal
a marketable idea,

122
00:04:49,916 --> 00:04:52,851
which she steals
and sells to the highest bidder.

123
00:04:52,852 --> 00:04:54,986
- That is ridiculous.
- Oh, is it?

124
00:04:54,987 --> 00:04:56,588
Let's see you come up
with an explanation

125
00:04:56,589 --> 00:04:59,291
as to why this woman hangs out
with us all the time.

126
00:05:03,563 --> 00:05:04,629
Oh, great. You know what?

127
00:05:04,630 --> 00:05:06,214
I've already mooched
dinner off you guys.

128
00:05:06,215 --> 00:05:07,566
I don't need to listen to this.

129
00:05:07,567 --> 00:05:10,168
There's your answer--
free food.

130
00:05:11,387 --> 00:05:12,971
All right,
I've taken the liberty

131
00:05:12,972 --> 00:05:14,906
of drafting
these workflow charts

132
00:05:14,907 --> 00:05:17,609
which outline our various duties
and the path we will follow

133
00:05:17,610 --> 00:05:19,945
as we develop
our ground-breaking new app.

134
00:05:21,547 --> 00:05:24,516
Hey, why am I in charge
of phone support?

135
00:05:25,618 --> 00:05:28,587
Seems a bit racist.

136
00:05:28,588 --> 00:05:30,355
A customer service
representative

137
00:05:30,356 --> 00:05:32,891
with an Indian accent
will create the impression

138
00:05:32,892 --> 00:05:35,493
we're a vast enterprise that
uses overseas call centers.

139
00:05:35,494 --> 00:05:37,128
Oh.

140
00:05:37,129 --> 00:05:38,463
Very clever.

141
00:05:38,464 --> 00:05:40,532
But still racist.

142
00:05:40,533 --> 00:05:44,569
Duly noted, Steve
from Wichita.

143
00:05:44,570 --> 00:05:48,206
Why am I listed as your
executive assistant?

144
00:05:48,207 --> 00:05:50,976
Because the word "secretary"
has fallen into disrepute.

145
00:05:50,977 --> 00:05:53,878
FYI, my mother's
birthday is coming up.

146
00:05:53,879 --> 00:05:56,681
I'm going to need you
to pick up a present.

147
00:05:57,783 --> 00:06:00,101
Okay, we need
to stop for a minute.

148
00:06:00,102 --> 00:06:01,653
Leonard, please,
we can talk during our break.

149
00:06:01,654 --> 00:06:03,121
We have one coming up
at midnight.

150
00:06:03,122 --> 00:06:05,290
We'll need snacks.

151
00:06:05,291 --> 00:06:06,591
Sheldon, you're not in charge.

152
00:06:06,592 --> 00:06:08,443
It's my idea.
I'm in charge.

153
00:06:08,444 --> 00:06:09,694
Oh, of course you are.

154
00:06:09,695 --> 00:06:11,029
Look at the organizational
chart.

155
00:06:11,030 --> 00:06:12,530
You're clearly listed
as founder.

156
00:06:12,531 --> 00:06:14,666
Well, yes, and you're listed

157
00:06:14,667 --> 00:06:16,701
as Chief Executive Officer,

158
00:06:16,702 --> 00:06:19,471
Chief Financial Officer
and Chief Operating Officer.

159
00:06:19,472 --> 00:06:21,089
You missed
Chief Science Officer,

160
00:06:21,090 --> 00:06:23,975
Chairman of the Board, and Head
of the Secret Santa Committee.

161
00:06:23,976 --> 00:06:26,011
Okay.

162
00:06:26,012 --> 00:06:28,763
You need to get clear
on this right now.

163
00:06:28,764 --> 00:06:30,815
I am in charge of this project.

164
00:06:30,816 --> 00:06:36,438
Ooh. Leonard's going all
alpha nerd on Sheldon's ass...

165
00:06:36,439 --> 00:06:38,923
All right. All right,
I'm not going to argue with you.

166
00:06:38,924 --> 00:06:41,109
Sheldon Cooper is nothing
if not a team player.

167
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:43,594
Dr. Hofstadter,
you have the conn.

168
00:06:45,498 --> 00:06:47,532
Thank you.

169
00:06:47,533 --> 00:06:48,800
I thought we might start

170
00:06:48,801 --> 00:06:50,485
by talking
about the user interface.

171
00:06:50,486 --> 00:06:52,037
Oh, dear Lord, we're doomed.

172
00:06:54,206 --> 00:06:56,474
So this button here

173
00:06:56,475 --> 00:06:58,776
will allow you
to scan a new equation,

174
00:06:58,777 --> 00:07:00,345
but over here,
you can press this,

175
00:07:00,346 --> 00:07:02,881
and just substitute new values
for the coefficients.

176
00:07:02,882 --> 00:07:05,634
Good one, boss.

177
00:07:08,387 --> 00:07:09,421
What?

178
00:07:09,422 --> 00:07:10,789
This diagram.

179
00:07:10,790 --> 00:07:13,258
I assume
you were opening with a joke.

180
00:07:13,259 --> 00:07:17,329
It certainly buoyed up
this employee's esprit de corps.

181
00:07:18,364 --> 00:07:20,565
It's not a joke.
It's the real design.

182
00:07:20,566 --> 00:07:23,634
In that case, may I offer
27 little tweaks

183
00:07:23,635 --> 00:07:25,937
to make it
slightly less embarrassing?

184
00:07:25,938 --> 00:07:27,972
Sheldon, I think
this will work.

185
00:07:27,973 --> 00:07:29,574
Let's just try it my way.

186
00:07:29,575 --> 00:07:31,076
Oh, I'm-I'm sorry.

187
00:07:31,077 --> 00:07:32,327
I assumed that you wanted

188
00:07:32,328 --> 00:07:34,412
candid truth-telling
from your employees,

189
00:07:34,413 --> 00:07:36,881
but I realize now,
you want the mindless nattering

190
00:07:36,882 --> 00:07:39,517
of complacent
yes-men.

191
00:07:39,518 --> 00:07:40,752
Are you done?

192
00:07:40,753 --> 00:07:42,687
If you say so, boss.

193
00:07:44,823 --> 00:07:46,725
So right now,
this button-press event

194
00:07:46,726 --> 00:07:48,693
is just triggering
a dummy procedure call...

195
00:07:48,694 --> 00:07:50,729
How about this
for the app name?

196
00:07:50,730 --> 00:07:53,531
The Surprisingly
Helpful Equation-Linked

197
00:07:53,532 --> 00:07:56,051
Differential
Optimized Numerator.

198
00:07:57,669 --> 00:08:00,605
So it spells "Sheldon."

199
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:02,724
Does it?

200
00:08:02,725 --> 00:08:04,809
A happy accident.

201
00:08:04,810 --> 00:08:08,546
We're not doing
names now. Howard?

202
00:08:08,547 --> 00:08:10,565
Like I was saying, right now
it's just a dummy procedure,

203
00:08:10,566 --> 00:08:11,883
but eventually,
it will drop us into...

204
00:08:11,884 --> 00:08:12,984
All right, fine.

205
00:08:12,985 --> 00:08:14,519
If we're not going
to give it a name,

206
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:16,687
can we at least give it
a secret code designation?

207
00:08:16,688 --> 00:08:18,690
- No.
- Hear me out.

208
00:08:18,691 --> 00:08:21,059
The atomic bomb
was The Manhattan Project.

209
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:23,912
Windows 95 was originally
Project Chicago.

210
00:08:23,913 --> 00:08:28,400
For our app, I would humbly
suggest Project Nodlehs.

211
00:08:28,401 --> 00:08:31,836
That's just
"Sheldon" backwards.

212
00:08:31,837 --> 00:08:33,838
Another happy accident.

213
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:37,575
We're not wasting time
with names right now.

214
00:08:37,576 --> 00:08:39,210
I see.

215
00:08:39,211 --> 00:08:40,879
Is that decision open
for discussion?

216
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,397
No.

217
00:08:42,398 --> 00:08:45,250
Is the decision to not
discuss it open for discussion?

218
00:08:45,251 --> 00:08:46,418
No.

219
00:08:46,419 --> 00:08:47,902
Again,

220
00:08:47,903 --> 00:08:49,821
right now it's just
a dummy procedure,

221
00:08:49,822 --> 00:08:52,257
but eventually,
it will drop us into...

222
00:08:52,258 --> 00:08:53,942
I call for a vote
of no confidence

223
00:08:53,943 --> 00:08:55,326
and an immediate change
in leadership.

224
00:08:55,327 --> 00:08:56,728
Sheldon, stop it.

225
00:08:56,729 --> 00:08:58,830
When in the course of human
events, it becomes necessary

226
00:08:58,831 --> 00:09:00,081
to dissolve the bonds

227
00:09:00,082 --> 00:09:01,833
that tie three competent
scientists together...

228
00:09:01,834 --> 00:09:03,734
That's enough, Sheldon.
All right, let's get right to the vote.

229
00:09:03,735 --> 00:09:05,620
Show of hands--
all those opposed

230
00:09:05,621 --> 00:09:07,439
to Leonard
and his reign of tyranny.

231
00:09:09,875 --> 00:09:11,376
Okay, that's it, you're fired.

232
00:09:11,377 --> 00:09:13,344
Really?

233
00:09:13,345 --> 00:09:15,313
Why?

234
00:09:16,248 --> 00:09:19,551
Because you're impossible
to work with.

235
00:09:19,552 --> 00:09:21,269
I see.

236
00:09:25,307 --> 00:09:27,358
And is that open
for discussion?

237
00:09:32,898 --> 00:09:34,032
What are you doing?

238
00:09:34,033 --> 00:09:37,001
Oh. Good morning, shoemaker.

239
00:09:38,137 --> 00:09:39,237
I think you'll be pleased

240
00:09:39,238 --> 00:09:41,206
with what the elves were up to
last night.

241
00:09:41,207 --> 00:09:43,107
I fired you.

242
00:09:43,108 --> 00:09:45,376
Oh, I know. I'm now
an independent contractor.

243
00:09:45,377 --> 00:09:48,797
No, you are
now nothing.

244
00:09:48,798 --> 00:09:51,749
You have no connection
to this project whatsoever.

245
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:54,185
But I made it better.

246
00:09:54,186 --> 00:09:56,421
I don't want it better.
I want it my way.

247
00:09:56,422 --> 00:09:59,858
Well, that speaks volumes,
doesn't it?

248
00:09:59,859 --> 00:10:03,761
All right, I suppose
I'll go put on my bus pants.

249
00:10:03,762 --> 00:10:06,014
What the hell are bus pants?

250
00:10:06,015 --> 00:10:08,466
They are pants one wears
over one's regular pants

251
00:10:08,467 --> 00:10:09,968
when one sits on bus seats

252
00:10:09,969 --> 00:10:12,337
that other people
have previously sat on.

253
00:10:13,989 --> 00:10:15,824
But perhaps
from your lofty heights

254
00:10:15,825 --> 00:10:17,742
atop the corporate ladder,
you've lost touch

255
00:10:17,743 --> 00:10:20,778
with the struggles
of the common man.

256
00:10:20,779 --> 00:10:23,648
Look, I'm still happy
to drive you to work.

257
00:10:23,649 --> 00:10:25,483
Nothing's changed
in that regard.

258
00:10:25,484 --> 00:10:28,453
We're still roommates,
we're still friends.

259
00:10:28,454 --> 00:10:30,889
Except you identified me,
your best friend,

260
00:10:30,890 --> 00:10:33,391
as a gangrenous limb
that needed to be severed

261
00:10:33,392 --> 00:10:35,009
from the organism
and tossed away.

262
00:10:35,010 --> 00:10:37,962
The desperate act
of a little man

263
00:10:37,963 --> 00:10:40,431
with a big Napoleon complex.

264
00:10:41,267 --> 00:10:43,268
You know what?

265
00:10:43,269 --> 00:10:45,570
Go put on your bus pants.

266
00:10:51,189 --> 00:10:53,124
Mm. Last night,
I had a dream

267
00:10:53,138 --> 00:10:54,738
we got so rich from the app,

268
00:10:54,739 --> 00:10:57,141
you and I bought matching
side-by-side mansions.

269
00:10:57,142 --> 00:10:58,943
But...

270
00:10:58,944 --> 00:11:00,394
there was a secret tunnel

271
00:11:00,395 --> 00:11:03,481
connecting your front yard
to my back yard.

272
00:11:08,353 --> 00:11:09,920
What do you think that means?

273
00:11:11,289 --> 00:11:15,042
It means after we play handball,
I'm showering at home.

274
00:11:18,130 --> 00:11:20,264
Good morning, Friend Howard.

275
00:11:20,265 --> 00:11:21,565
Friend Raj.

276
00:11:21,566 --> 00:11:24,101
I see you gentlemen
are enjoying beverages.

277
00:11:24,102 --> 00:11:27,505
Perhaps they would taste better
out of these.

278
00:11:28,907 --> 00:11:30,841
"World's Greatest
Astrophysicist"?

279
00:11:30,842 --> 00:11:33,410
Don't thank me. You earned it.

280
00:11:34,429 --> 00:11:37,848
"Howard Wolowitz."

281
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:41,919
Why not
"World's Greatest Engineer"?

282
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:43,020
I'm sorry.

283
00:11:43,021 --> 00:11:44,755
I typed that
into the label maker,

284
00:11:44,756 --> 00:11:46,090
but I just couldn't press enter.

285
00:11:46,091 --> 00:11:48,275
Now down to business.

286
00:11:48,276 --> 00:11:51,462
What would it take for you
to abandon Leonard

287
00:11:51,463 --> 00:11:52,997
and join me in a rival company?

288
00:11:52,998 --> 00:11:55,166
Unless, of course,
the mugs are sufficient,

289
00:11:55,167 --> 00:11:57,701
in which case, welcome aboard.

290
00:11:57,702 --> 00:11:59,870
We're not quitting on Leonard.

291
00:11:59,871 --> 00:12:02,706
I understand.
Your loyalty is admirable.

292
00:12:02,707 --> 00:12:06,343
But what if I were
to up the ante?

293
00:12:06,344 --> 00:12:08,512
What are you talking about?

294
00:12:08,513 --> 00:12:11,048
Monogrammed key chains

295
00:12:11,049 --> 00:12:13,851
with a built-in laser pointer.

296
00:12:16,454 --> 00:12:18,556
No?

297
00:12:19,608 --> 00:12:21,442
How about can cozies

298
00:12:21,443 --> 00:12:25,062
emblazoned
with our university mascot?

299
00:12:25,063 --> 00:12:27,865
Go, Beavers.

300
00:12:28,833 --> 00:12:30,901
I'll be back.

301
00:12:33,205 --> 00:12:35,739
Okay, let's try this one.

302
00:12:38,143 --> 00:12:39,977
"Spherical Hankel function."

303
00:12:39,978 --> 00:12:41,545
Hold on.

304
00:12:41,546 --> 00:12:42,713
That's it!

305
00:12:42,714 --> 00:12:43,914
Eureka!

306
00:12:43,915 --> 00:12:45,749
Hey, we agreed when
it was "Eureka" time,

307
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:47,751
we were all gonna
say it together.

308
00:12:47,752 --> 00:12:48,952
Fine.

309
00:12:48,953 --> 00:12:49,953
Let's say it together.

310
00:12:49,954 --> 00:12:51,989
No. The moment
has passed.

311
00:12:51,990 --> 00:12:54,692
Greetings, gentlemen.

312
00:12:54,693 --> 00:12:56,727
How goes your
little project?

313
00:12:56,728 --> 00:12:59,963
You mean,
"Project Lenwoloppali"?

314
00:12:59,964 --> 00:13:03,267
Ah, a combination
of all your names.

315
00:13:03,268 --> 00:13:04,351
Very clever.

316
00:13:04,352 --> 00:13:07,137
I assume "Koothranardowitz"
was taken?

317
00:13:08,707 --> 00:13:10,474
We're actually
scanning equations

318
00:13:10,475 --> 00:13:11,842
and getting good results.

319
00:13:11,843 --> 00:13:14,161
Oh, well then,
by all means, carry on.

320
00:13:14,162 --> 00:13:16,080
I wouldn't want
to impede your progress.

321
00:13:16,081 --> 00:13:18,582
Howard, did you solve
the install time problem yet?

322
00:13:18,583 --> 00:13:20,117
No. It's a little tricky.

323
00:13:20,118 --> 00:13:22,086
I'm gonna try having it pick up
the libraries dyn...

324
00:13:29,377 --> 00:13:30,961
What are you doing?!

325
00:13:30,962 --> 00:13:34,765
Playing the theremin.

326
00:13:36,301 --> 00:13:39,536
No. I mean, what are you
doing with a theremin?

327
00:13:39,537 --> 00:13:42,072
Playing it.

328
00:13:42,073 --> 00:13:45,309
I've loved the theremin
from the first moment

329
00:13:45,310 --> 00:13:47,444
I heard the original
<i>Star Trek</i> theme.

330
00:13:47,445 --> 00:13:48,912
And it's been killing me

331
00:13:48,913 --> 00:13:51,882
that it just sits in my closet,
gathering dust.

332
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:59,074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

333
00:14:05,864 --> 00:14:08,165
Sheldon!
We're working here!

334
00:14:08,166 --> 00:14:09,433
That's all right.

335
00:14:09,434 --> 00:14:13,304
I can barely hear you
over my theremin.

336
00:14:18,843 --> 00:14:21,612
Well, that was a
little uncalled for.

337
00:14:21,613 --> 00:14:23,580
No, that was
completely called for.

338
00:14:23,581 --> 00:14:24,932
We need quiet.

339
00:14:24,933 --> 00:14:27,284
So, your project is more
important than mine?

340
00:14:27,285 --> 00:14:31,522
Well, seeing as your project
is to sabotage my project, yes.

341
00:14:31,523 --> 00:14:33,090
Don't beat around the bush,
Leonard.

342
00:14:33,091 --> 00:14:34,124
If you don't want me here,

343
00:14:34,125 --> 00:14:36,059
just say the word,
and I'll leave.

344
00:14:40,899 --> 00:14:43,000
Could have beaten
around the bush a little.

345
00:14:45,470 --> 00:14:49,907
? Nobody knows ?

346
00:14:49,908 --> 00:14:52,876
? The trouble I've seen ?

347
00:14:52,877 --> 00:14:58,382
? Nobody knows my sorrow ?

348
00:14:58,383 --> 00:15:01,819
? Oh, oh, oh. ?

349
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:03,454
What you doing?

350
00:15:03,455 --> 00:15:05,789
Trying to contact
your home planet?

351
00:15:05,790 --> 00:15:08,359
I'm practicing my theremin.

352
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:10,227
Oh.

353
00:15:10,228 --> 00:15:12,796
? Nobody knows ?

354
00:15:12,797 --> 00:15:15,566
? The trouble I've seen ?

355
00:15:15,567 --> 00:15:19,903
? Glory, hallelujah. ?

356
00:15:21,642 --> 00:15:23,633
Something got you down,
there, Sheldon?

357
00:15:23,808 --> 00:15:26,276
Leonard kicked me out
of my own apartment.

358
00:15:26,277 --> 00:15:27,478
And his app team.

359
00:15:27,479 --> 00:15:29,613
Oh, honey, I'm sorry.

360
00:15:29,614 --> 00:15:31,498
He wouldn't drive me
to work today.

361
00:15:31,499 --> 00:15:33,667
I had to wear
my bus pants.

362
00:15:33,668 --> 00:15:35,586
- Is that so?
- Yes.

363
00:15:35,587 --> 00:15:36,987
And they're
still sticky.

364
00:15:36,988 --> 00:15:38,155
Aw...

365
00:15:38,156 --> 00:15:40,257
Probably going to have
to throw them away.

366
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:44,795
Hey, you don't need
Leonard and his app.

367
00:15:44,796 --> 00:15:46,063
You can make one with me.

368
00:15:46,064 --> 00:15:47,831
With you?

369
00:15:49,401 --> 00:15:51,902
Seriously,
I have a great idea for one.

370
00:15:51,903 --> 00:15:54,438
Is it better than your idea
to move to Los Angeles

371
00:15:54,439 --> 00:15:56,140
and become a famous actress?

372
00:15:58,685 --> 00:15:59,286
Okay, look...

373
00:15:59,330 --> 00:16:01,181
when you see someone
wearing shoes you like,

374
00:16:01,182 --> 00:16:02,566
you just snap a picture of them,

375
00:16:02,567 --> 00:16:04,101
and the app goes on the Internet

376
00:16:04,102 --> 00:16:05,635
to find out
where you can buy them.

377
00:16:05,636 --> 00:16:07,938
That's your app idea?

378
00:16:07,939 --> 00:16:08,872
Well, you don't like it?

379
00:16:08,873 --> 00:16:10,974
I didn't say that.
But no, I don't.

380
00:16:10,975 --> 00:16:13,510
Why not?

381
00:16:13,511 --> 00:16:15,012
Oh, Penny,
where do I begin?

382
00:16:15,013 --> 00:16:17,480
The simple-mindedness
of your idea

383
00:16:17,481 --> 00:16:21,084
is exceeded only by its
crass consumerism and banality.

384
00:16:21,085 --> 00:16:22,986
And Leonard didn't want
to work with you?

385
00:16:22,987 --> 00:16:24,621
Imagine that.

386
00:16:24,622 --> 00:16:26,423
I know, it's baffling.

387
00:16:28,209 --> 00:16:31,695
? Nobody knows ?

388
00:16:31,696 --> 00:16:34,398
? The trouble I've seen... ?

389
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:36,500
Sheldon, I'm gonna
make some cocoa.

390
00:16:36,501 --> 00:16:38,101
Do you want some?

391
00:16:38,102 --> 00:16:39,870
Do you make it
with milk or water?

392
00:16:39,871 --> 00:16:41,538
- Milk.
- Real cocoa?

393
00:16:41,539 --> 00:16:43,607
That's what it says
on the packet.

394
00:16:43,608 --> 00:16:45,809
Do you have
those little marshmallows?

395
00:16:45,810 --> 00:16:46,777
No, sorry.

396
00:16:46,778 --> 00:16:49,212
Well, I suppose
it's appropriate.

397
00:16:49,213 --> 00:16:50,314
What does that mean?

398
00:16:50,315 --> 00:16:54,117
A disappointing drink
for a disappointing day.

399
00:16:56,955 --> 00:16:58,221
Hey, look at this.

400
00:16:58,222 --> 00:17:00,257
20 people from the university
have already signed up

401
00:17:00,258 --> 00:17:01,758
for our private beta.

402
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:03,026
I'm telling you,

403
00:17:03,027 --> 00:17:05,095
the Lenwoloppali
Differential Equation Scanner

404
00:17:05,096 --> 00:17:07,965
meets a real need.
We've got a hit.

405
00:17:07,966 --> 00:17:09,433
What do you think we
should sell it for?

406
00:17:09,434 --> 00:17:12,035
Well, based on the fact
that our potential market

407
00:17:12,036 --> 00:17:14,071
is about 70 or 80 guys,

408
00:17:14,072 --> 00:17:15,205
and you want a submarine,

409
00:17:15,206 --> 00:17:17,040
I'd say about a
million dollars a pop.

410
00:17:17,041 --> 00:17:20,344
Well, what if we put out a lite
version for half a million?

411
00:17:20,345 --> 00:17:22,145
You know,
get the word of mouth going.

412
00:17:23,247 --> 00:17:25,349
Hi. I'm sorry
to bother you guys,

413
00:17:25,350 --> 00:17:27,150
but you've got to come
take your Sheldon back.

414
00:17:27,151 --> 00:17:28,952
What's he doing
in your apartment?

415
00:17:28,953 --> 00:17:31,388
Well, he was moping down in the
lobby, so I invited him over.

416
00:17:31,389 --> 00:17:32,656
Now I regret it.

417
00:17:32,657 --> 00:17:35,275
Why do you regret...
Uh, never mind, stupid question.

418
00:17:35,276 --> 00:17:37,661
Look, can't you just let him
play with you until bedtime?

419
00:17:37,662 --> 00:17:40,747
We're not playing.

420
00:17:40,748 --> 00:17:41,932
This is real work.

421
00:17:41,933 --> 00:17:44,101
We're going to
be hundred-aires.

422
00:17:44,902 --> 00:17:46,803
Okay. What if I got him
to apologize

423
00:17:46,804 --> 00:17:48,171
and promise to behave?

424
00:17:51,442 --> 00:17:54,244
Then I guess we would
let him back on the app team,

425
00:17:54,245 --> 00:17:56,546
and while we're doing that,
you could take an aerial tour

426
00:17:56,547 --> 00:17:59,716
of L.A. on your flying pig.

427
00:17:59,717 --> 00:18:01,852
Okay. Wait right here.

428
00:18:03,121 --> 00:18:05,555
I'll tell you one thing.
If I get rich enough,

429
00:18:05,556 --> 00:18:08,759
that's the kind of girl I want
to take on a submarine ride.

430
00:18:09,694 --> 00:18:12,863
And yes, that time,
I meant it to be dirty.

431
00:18:15,099 --> 00:18:16,600
Really?

432
00:18:16,601 --> 00:18:18,235
Leonard wants me back?

433
00:18:18,236 --> 00:18:21,371
Oh, yes. He says they
are lost without you.

434
00:18:21,372 --> 00:18:25,042
Well, we sure saw that coming.

435
00:18:25,043 --> 00:18:26,493
That's right.

436
00:18:26,494 --> 00:18:27,778
You know what
I'm going to do?

437
00:18:27,779 --> 00:18:31,281
I am going to sit here
and just let them stew.

438
00:18:35,253 --> 00:18:36,253
No, no, no. You know,

439
00:18:36,254 --> 00:18:37,888
they have
suffered enough.

440
00:18:37,889 --> 00:18:40,357
Everybody's
suffered enough.

441
00:18:40,358 --> 00:18:43,527
The thing is, you're going
to have to offer him

442
00:18:43,528 --> 00:18:45,562
a face-saving
way out of this.

443
00:18:45,563 --> 00:18:46,730
How?

444
00:18:46,731 --> 00:18:47,931
Say you're sorry.

445
00:18:47,932 --> 00:18:49,566
Oh, no.

446
00:18:49,567 --> 00:18:53,070
Mrs. Mary Cooper
didn't raise her no liars.

447
00:18:53,071 --> 00:18:56,173
Okay. Um...

448
00:18:56,174 --> 00:18:57,974
How about this? You know
how you're always trying

449
00:18:57,975 --> 00:18:59,176
to learn about sarcasm?

450
00:18:59,177 --> 00:19:00,944
No.
No?

451
00:19:00,945 --> 00:19:02,612
I was being sarcastic.

452
00:19:03,714 --> 00:19:05,949
Oh. Good for you.

453
00:19:05,950 --> 00:19:08,351
So all you have to do here
is say you're sorry to Leonard,

454
00:19:08,352 --> 00:19:10,087
but say it
sarcastically.

455
00:19:10,088 --> 00:19:12,289
Of course.

456
00:19:12,290 --> 00:19:15,225
He will hear it as an attempt
to mend fences,

457
00:19:15,226 --> 00:19:17,594
as opposed
to the withering condemnation

458
00:19:17,595 --> 00:19:19,362
you and I will know it to be.

459
00:19:19,363 --> 00:19:21,882
Yeah. Yeah, that
was my plan.

460
00:19:21,883 --> 00:19:23,133
All right.
Come on. Let's go.

461
00:19:23,134 --> 00:19:24,667
Oh, by the way,
thank you

462
00:19:24,668 --> 00:19:26,536
for the delicious cocoa.

463
00:19:26,537 --> 00:19:27,537
Oh, you're welcome.

464
00:19:27,538 --> 00:19:29,339
Boy, I'm getting
good at this.

465
00:19:32,610 --> 00:19:35,011
Okay, now that you're
back on the team,

466
00:19:35,012 --> 00:19:36,012
let's get you caught up.

467
00:19:36,013 --> 00:19:38,515
Before you begin,
let me say again

468
00:19:38,516 --> 00:19:41,585
how deeply sorry I am
for my earlier behavior

469
00:19:41,586 --> 00:19:45,822
and how much I respect
and admire your leadership.

470
00:19:45,823 --> 00:19:49,626
Thank you.

471
00:19:53,731 --> 00:19:55,098
So as you can see,

472
00:19:55,099 --> 00:19:57,934
not only can you store
your favorite equations,

473
00:19:57,935 --> 00:20:00,137
but you can forward them
to your friends

474
00:20:00,138 --> 00:20:03,440
or post them on Facebook
right from the app.

475
00:20:03,441 --> 00:20:05,509
Well, I must say,
I am impressed.

476
00:20:05,510 --> 00:20:06,593
Thanks.

477
00:20:06,594 --> 00:20:08,845
You all have clearly put
in a lot of hard work.

478
00:20:08,846 --> 00:20:10,013
We have.

479
00:20:10,014 --> 00:20:11,248
As a result,
you have taken

480
00:20:11,249 --> 00:20:13,383
the most important step
on the road to success:

481
00:20:13,384 --> 00:20:15,068
learning what not to do.

482
00:20:15,069 --> 00:20:16,886
Now, let's start fresh.

483
00:20:16,887 --> 00:20:19,489
Howard, we're going
to need some tea.

484
00:20:24,587 --> 00:20:27,222
Okay, these are Uggs.

485
00:20:27,223 --> 00:20:29,925
These are Crocs.

486
00:20:29,926 --> 00:20:32,294
These are knockoff
Manolo Blahniks.

487
00:20:32,295 --> 00:20:33,862
Bored.

488
00:20:33,863 --> 00:20:36,848
Look, you said it yourself,
we have to create a database

489
00:20:36,849 --> 00:20:38,967
before you can write
an alga-thingy.

490
00:20:38,968 --> 00:20:40,368
Algorithm.

491
00:20:40,369 --> 00:20:42,771
You see, Penny, Alan Turing
defined an algorithm...

492
00:20:42,772 --> 00:20:44,539
Bored.

493
00:20:44,540 --> 00:20:45,540
Okay.

494
00:20:45,541 --> 00:20:47,342
These are Steve Maddens.

495
00:20:47,343 --> 00:20:49,244
These are Nine West.

496
00:20:49,245 --> 00:20:52,748
These are Target. Oh, but don't
they look like Chanel?

497
00:20:52,749 --> 00:20:53,949
These are
Michael Kors...

498
00:20:53,950 --> 00:20:55,317
? Nobody knows... ?
