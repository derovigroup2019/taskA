1
00:00:04,846 --> 00:00:06,370
Leonard, are you in the shower?

2
00:00:06,548 --> 00:00:09,642
I can't hear you. I'm in the shower.

3
00:00:09,817 --> 00:00:13,719
I asked if you were in the shower,
but that's moot now.

4
00:00:13,888 --> 00:00:15,014
What?

5
00:00:15,189 --> 00:00:19,683
Moot.
Rendered unimportant by recent events.

6
00:00:19,861 --> 00:00:22,261
I can't hear you. I'm in the shower.

7
00:00:22,430 --> 00:00:24,227
I have to skip the chitchat.

8
00:00:24,399 --> 00:00:25,593
Emergency.

9
00:00:25,767 --> 00:00:28,463
- What kind of emergency?
- Mathematical.

10
00:00:28,636 --> 00:00:31,935
Thirty-two-ounce banana smoothie,
16 ounce bladder.

11
00:00:33,074 --> 00:00:34,473
You might not wanna do that.

12
00:00:34,642 --> 00:00:36,132
No, I assure you I do.

13
00:00:37,078 --> 00:00:38,773
Sheldon, I'm not alone in here.

14
00:00:38,947 --> 00:00:40,608
What?

15
00:00:41,916 --> 00:00:43,611
Hello, Sheldon.

16
00:00:43,785 --> 00:00:46,447
What are you doing in there?
She can't be in here.

17
00:00:46,621 --> 00:00:47,815
We were in here first.

18
00:00:47,989 --> 00:00:50,651
- You can't be here.
- According to the roommate agreement...

19
00:00:50,825 --> 00:00:53,953
The right to bathroom privacy...

20
00:00:54,128 --> 00:00:56,392
...is suspended
in the event of force majeure.

21
00:00:56,564 --> 00:01:00,796
And believe me,
I'm experiencing a very majeure force.

22
00:01:01,502 --> 00:01:03,629
Oh, come on,
you can't wait two minutes?

23
00:01:03,805 --> 00:01:06,069
Leonard, let the man pee.

24
00:01:11,679 --> 00:01:15,342
Penny. Penny. Penny.

25
00:01:16,117 --> 00:01:19,450
- What?
- Move, move, move.

26
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:27,074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

27
00:01:46,614 --> 00:01:47,945
You dance with me.

28
00:01:48,116 --> 00:01:51,279
Dr. Leonard Hofstadter,
you are officially charged...

29
00:01:51,452 --> 00:01:55,047
...with two violations
of the roommate agreement.

30
00:01:55,223 --> 00:01:57,851
- Do you waive reading of the charges?
- Yeah, fine.

31
00:01:58,026 --> 00:02:01,860
Hang on, no. My client does not waive
reading of the charges.

32
00:02:02,630 --> 00:02:03,858
Oh.

33
00:02:04,032 --> 00:02:05,932
Cool, I've got a lawyer.

34
00:02:08,269 --> 00:02:10,533
And I've seen her naked. Heh, heh.

35
00:02:11,706 --> 00:02:13,435
Proceed.

36
00:02:13,775 --> 00:02:15,572
Very well. Ahem.

37
00:02:15,743 --> 00:02:19,372
On or about the 28th day of April...

38
00:02:19,547 --> 00:02:22,448
...the accused did knowingly
and with malice aforethought...

39
00:02:22,617 --> 00:02:25,950
...deny access to the shared bathroom
in a time of emergency...

40
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:28,918
...to wit, my back teeth were floating.

41
00:02:29,757 --> 00:02:32,317
The accused exceeded...

42
00:02:32,493 --> 00:02:34,552
...the agreed upon occupancy
of the shower.

43
00:02:34,729 --> 00:02:35,787
To wit, one.

44
00:02:35,963 --> 00:02:38,796
Unless we are under attack
by water-soluble aliens.

45
00:02:41,602 --> 00:02:43,502
Can I see the roommate agreement?

46
00:02:43,671 --> 00:02:46,606
Um, it's fairly technical.

47
00:02:47,175 --> 00:02:48,403
I think I can handle it.

48
00:02:49,911 --> 00:02:52,345
Top of her class.
Cambridge University.

49
00:02:52,513 --> 00:02:56,313
Licensed to practice law
in three countries and your face.

50
00:03:01,956 --> 00:03:05,448
All right. Based on a cursory reading,
it doesn't look like...

51
00:03:05,626 --> 00:03:09,756
...you have much of a case, Sheldon.
- Do so, do so.

52
00:03:10,665 --> 00:03:11,859
Oh, I'm afraid not.

53
00:03:12,033 --> 00:03:13,261
Section seven here...

54
00:03:13,434 --> 00:03:15,994
...on the right to enter
in emergency situations...

55
00:03:16,170 --> 00:03:18,934
...is not specific
as to what constitutes an emergency.

56
00:03:19,107 --> 00:03:20,369
No, that's ridiculous.

57
00:03:20,541 --> 00:03:22,634
A bathroom emergency
is self-explanatory.

58
00:03:23,177 --> 00:03:25,543
Is it?
If Leonard forgot to trim his nose hair...

59
00:03:25,713 --> 00:03:28,113
...could he barge in
while you were showering?

60
00:03:28,282 --> 00:03:30,716
Irrelevant.
Leonard doesn't trim his nose hair.

61
00:03:30,918 --> 00:03:34,012
He thinks because he's short,
nobody can see up there.

62
00:03:37,792 --> 00:03:39,783
Point is, Sheldon, the legal principle...

63
00:03:39,961 --> 00:03:43,362
...is ambiguity in a contract
benefits the party that did not draft it.

64
00:03:43,531 --> 00:03:46,227
In this case, Leonard.
So much for count one.

65
00:03:46,434 --> 00:03:49,232
- But...
- No buts. That's how the law works.

66
00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:50,796
Schooled.

67
00:03:55,743 --> 00:03:59,144
As for the shower capacity issue,
I cite addendum J.

68
00:03:59,313 --> 00:04:02,476
"When Sheldon showers second,
all measures shall be taken...

69
00:04:02,650 --> 00:04:04,845
...to ensure an adequate supply
of hot water."

70
00:04:05,019 --> 00:04:07,749
I believe
this supersedes the occupancy issue.

71
00:04:07,922 --> 00:04:10,152
Superseded.

72
00:04:15,096 --> 00:04:16,256
This isn't over.

73
00:04:19,767 --> 00:04:21,928
No offense, but shower sex with you...

74
00:04:22,103 --> 00:04:25,197
...is now the second best thing
that's happened today.

75
00:04:27,809 --> 00:04:30,243
Hmm. Greek food on pizza night.

76
00:04:30,411 --> 00:04:34,108
This is the most cruel thing we've done to
Sheldon since we left that fake message...

77
00:04:34,282 --> 00:04:36,682
...from Stephen Hawking
on his voicemail.

78
00:04:38,052 --> 00:04:39,280
Seriously?

79
00:04:39,453 --> 00:04:41,284
I wish to discuss your theories...

80
00:04:41,455 --> 00:04:43,582
...on black holes.
- Ha-ha-ha.

81
00:04:44,358 --> 00:04:48,419
Meet me at the Randy's Donut
by the airport at 2 a.m.

82
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,095
What is that you're eating?

83
00:04:54,268 --> 00:04:55,599
Tonight is pizza night.

84
00:04:55,770 --> 00:04:58,739
I'd like to refer that to my attorney.

85
00:05:00,308 --> 00:05:03,937
According to what I see here, Thursday
nights are Franconi's Pizza night.

86
00:05:04,111 --> 00:05:06,602
Yes. And when Franconi's
went out of business...

87
00:05:06,781 --> 00:05:08,544
...we switched to Graziano's.

88
00:05:08,716 --> 00:05:13,050
That's interesting. Can you just
switch restaurants like that, Priya?

89
00:05:15,723 --> 00:05:17,748
Good question, Howard.

90
00:05:17,925 --> 00:05:19,324
Turns out you can't.

91
00:05:19,493 --> 00:05:23,725
According to the document you drew up,
the selection of a new takeout restaurant...

92
00:05:23,898 --> 00:05:27,334
...requires public hearings
and a 60-day comment period.

93
00:05:27,535 --> 00:05:28,934
Were those criteria met?

94
00:05:35,776 --> 00:05:37,573
No.

95
00:05:42,583 --> 00:05:44,414
Well, this is Greek food.

96
00:05:44,585 --> 00:05:46,177
Leonard, you hate Greek food.

97
00:05:46,354 --> 00:05:48,584
Not as much as you.

98
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:54,152
Fine.

99
00:05:54,328 --> 00:05:56,421
I'm nothing if not adaptable.

100
00:05:57,632 --> 00:06:00,829
I got you the lamb kabob.

101
00:06:01,002 --> 00:06:02,867
- Thank you.
- Mm.

102
00:06:24,025 --> 00:06:27,620
If you think about it, Greek food
isn't that far from Italian food.

103
00:06:27,795 --> 00:06:30,525
They share a spice palette.

104
00:06:35,636 --> 00:06:39,402
And what a civilization is the Greeks'.

105
00:06:43,311 --> 00:06:44,335
Mm.

106
00:06:44,512 --> 00:06:47,913
They gave us science, democracy...

107
00:06:48,115 --> 00:06:51,642
...and little cubes of charred meat
that taste like sweat.

108
00:06:55,623 --> 00:06:58,683
Penny. Penny. Penny.

109
00:07:00,194 --> 00:07:02,389
- Hey, what's up?
- The mean Indian lady...

110
00:07:02,563 --> 00:07:04,724
...tried to make me eat lamb.

111
00:07:07,768 --> 00:07:11,898
Congratulations, pizza night will now be
at your apartment. Order one.

112
00:07:12,573 --> 00:07:15,007
Sorry, I'm meeting Amy and Bernadette
for dinner.

113
00:07:15,176 --> 00:07:16,871
You're welcome to tag along.

114
00:07:17,044 --> 00:07:18,204
A girls' night?

115
00:07:18,379 --> 00:07:21,780
Oh, I don't know if I'm up for talking
about rainbows, unicorns...

116
00:07:21,949 --> 00:07:23,678
...and menstrual cramps.

117
00:07:24,352 --> 00:07:26,013
Okay, suit yourself.

118
00:07:26,454 --> 00:07:28,547
We'll probably
be trashing Priya a little.

119
00:07:28,723 --> 00:07:30,748
Shotgun.

120
00:07:32,593 --> 00:07:35,892
Okay, I'd like to propose a toast
to a wonderful girls' night out.

121
00:07:36,964 --> 00:07:40,525
Fair warning, we can get crazy.

122
00:07:40,701 --> 00:07:44,398
Yeah. Last week we smoked cigars
and pretended to be dragons.

123
00:07:46,107 --> 00:07:47,199
Really, Amy?

124
00:07:47,375 --> 00:07:51,573
Tobacco and alcohol? Need I remind you
not a lot of scientific discoveries...

125
00:07:51,746 --> 00:07:54,214
...were made
by people having a good time?

126
00:07:57,218 --> 00:07:59,709
Why did you bring him?
He's harshing my buzz.

127
00:08:00,755 --> 00:08:03,883
I felt sorry for him.
Priya's giving him a hard time.

128
00:08:04,058 --> 00:08:07,255
The Priya bashing's starting early.
Yay, heh.

129
00:08:08,929 --> 00:08:11,989
Okay, what's up with those pantsuits?

130
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,233
I need some context.

131
00:08:14,402 --> 00:08:15,630
Pantsuits suck.

132
00:08:15,803 --> 00:08:18,567
And that opens her up
to justifiable ridicule for wearing them.

133
00:08:18,739 --> 00:08:19,899
Good one, Bernadette.

134
00:08:21,742 --> 00:08:24,438
See? Crazy.

135
00:08:28,883 --> 00:08:30,908
Whee!

136
00:08:34,989 --> 00:08:37,082
You smell like baby powder.

137
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:39,421
It's talc.

138
00:08:39,593 --> 00:08:42,084
As that's the primary ingredient
of baby powder...

139
00:08:42,263 --> 00:08:44,527
...I understand your confusion.

140
00:08:44,698 --> 00:08:47,292
Oh, I'm not confused at all.

141
00:08:48,069 --> 00:08:50,503
You're like a sexy toddler.

142
00:08:52,573 --> 00:08:54,734
I don't know how to process that.

143
00:08:56,310 --> 00:08:58,403
I do.

144
00:08:58,579 --> 00:09:05,246
Amy and Sheldon sitting in a tree,
K-l-S-S-S-S-l-N-G.

145
00:09:06,087 --> 00:09:08,351
That's too many S's for kissing.

146
00:09:08,522 --> 00:09:10,547
Not if they're doing it for a long time.

147
00:09:13,494 --> 00:09:16,691
Sheldon, have you ever kissed a girl?

148
00:09:17,298 --> 00:09:20,426
Other than my mother,
my sister and my meemaw, no.

149
00:09:20,868 --> 00:09:24,201
But in the interest of full disclosure,
I was once on a bus...

150
00:09:24,371 --> 00:09:27,340
...and gave mouth-to-mouth
resuscitation to an elderly nun...

151
00:09:27,508 --> 00:09:29,476
...who passed out
from heat exhaustion.

152
00:09:30,778 --> 00:09:35,909
Yeah, every year I get a Christmas card
from her signed with too many X's and O's.

153
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:38,308
That doesn't count.

154
00:09:38,486 --> 00:09:40,215
Aren't you even a little curious?

155
00:09:40,387 --> 00:09:42,014
Yeah, you're a scientist.

156
00:09:42,189 --> 00:09:43,918
Where is the curiosity?

157
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:47,219
I'm available for experimentation.

158
00:09:50,498 --> 00:09:51,988
Thank you.

159
00:09:52,166 --> 00:09:55,567
Not necessary. We know everything
there is to know about kissing.

160
00:09:55,736 --> 00:09:59,365
It requires 34 facial muscles
and 112 postural muscles.

161
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:02,475
Oh, blah, blah, blah.
Give me some sugar, bestie.

162
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:11,208
I'm certainly glad no one said they were
curious about Aztec human sacrifice.

163
00:10:11,385 --> 00:10:14,183
Hey, I know.
Let's take Sheldon dancing.

164
00:10:14,355 --> 00:10:16,550
Oh, I totally wanna see Sheldon dance.

165
00:10:16,724 --> 00:10:19,386
I bet he looks like a spider
on a hot plate.

166
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:20,720
Ha, ha.

167
00:10:20,895 --> 00:10:24,126
No, thank you. But for the record,
I'm an excellent dancer.

168
00:10:24,298 --> 00:10:26,732
I'm proficient in the rumba, waltz
and cha-cha.

169
00:10:26,901 --> 00:10:29,563
- Really?
- I don't see why that's surprising.

170
00:10:29,737 --> 00:10:31,227
I excel at so many things.

171
00:10:31,405 --> 00:10:33,703
You've had my sourdough bread.

172
00:10:34,775 --> 00:10:36,174
Did you take dance lessons?

173
00:10:36,343 --> 00:10:37,571
Against my will.

174
00:10:37,745 --> 00:10:42,205
In the South, preadolescent children
are forced through cotillion...

175
00:10:42,383 --> 00:10:46,114
...which indoctrinates them with all
social graces and dance skills needed...

176
00:10:46,287 --> 00:10:49,347
...to function in 18th century Vienna.

177
00:10:50,624 --> 00:10:53,422
Oh, we are so taking you dancing.

178
00:10:53,594 --> 00:10:55,858
No, you most certainly are not.

179
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:59,261
What does your cotillion training say
is expected of a gentleman...

180
00:10:59,433 --> 00:11:02,561
...when three ladies ask him
to escort them to a dance soir?e?

181
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:07,805
I saved a nun's life.

182
00:11:07,975 --> 00:11:10,307
Why am I being punished?

183
00:11:14,615 --> 00:11:16,173
- Oh.
- Oof!

184
00:11:17,351 --> 00:11:19,251
Take us someplace we can waltz.

185
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:20,478
Where you can what?

186
00:11:20,654 --> 00:11:23,487
Waltz.
It's a social dance from Austria...

187
00:11:23,657 --> 00:11:25,852
...choreographed
to a three-four time signature.

188
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:42,409
Ah, waltz.

189
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:48,643
Here we go.

190
00:11:50,484 --> 00:11:54,284
I kissed a girl, and I liked it

191
00:11:56,290 --> 00:11:57,689
What happened to you?

192
00:12:17,811 --> 00:12:19,676
Shake it, baby, shake it.

193
00:12:19,847 --> 00:12:21,747
Muy caliente, Sheldon.

194
00:12:24,218 --> 00:12:27,847
- Care to dance?
- Oh, sorry, I'm engaged.

195
00:12:29,023 --> 00:12:30,684
How about you?

196
00:12:30,858 --> 00:12:33,122
Oh, what the hell. Ha-ha-ha.

197
00:12:33,794 --> 00:12:35,159
Oh.

198
00:12:52,246 --> 00:12:56,376
How come, if we're the smart people,
we don't do this every night?

199
00:12:56,550 --> 00:12:59,018
What's 16 times 14?

200
00:12:59,553 --> 00:13:02,317
My burps taste like cranberry juice.

201
00:13:05,092 --> 00:13:06,992
And there's your answer.

202
00:13:08,128 --> 00:13:09,857
You like to come in for a nightcap?

203
00:13:10,264 --> 00:13:13,131
If you're referring to the beverage,
you know I don't drink.

204
00:13:13,334 --> 00:13:15,768
If to the hat you don
while wearing a nightshirt...

205
00:13:15,936 --> 00:13:18,598
...and holding a candle, I have one.

206
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:21,337
I have Yoo-Hoo.

207
00:13:21,775 --> 00:13:23,743
It's hard to say no to Yoo-Hoo.

208
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:27,008
The name literally beckons.

209
00:13:30,651 --> 00:13:32,585
Make yourself comfortable.

210
00:13:32,753 --> 00:13:34,482
Thank you.

211
00:13:35,389 --> 00:13:37,016
Is someone smoking?

212
00:13:37,191 --> 00:13:38,852
Oh, that's just Ricky.

213
00:13:44,064 --> 00:13:47,090
- You own a smoking monkey?
- Don't be silly.

214
00:13:47,267 --> 00:13:51,169
He's one of the animals in my
department's nicotine addiction study.

215
00:13:52,473 --> 00:13:55,067
- What's he doing here?
- I'm giving him emphysema.

216
00:13:55,242 --> 00:13:58,040
The least I can do
is let him hang out and watch cable.

217
00:13:59,947 --> 00:14:01,312
Remarkable.

218
00:14:02,649 --> 00:14:05,584
- You worried about secondhand smoke?
- A little.

219
00:14:05,753 --> 00:14:09,416
The real danger is him biting my face off
while I'm sleeping.

220
00:14:12,693 --> 00:14:15,526
Is he deliberately blowing smoke
at me?

221
00:14:15,696 --> 00:14:18,756
Yeah. He's kind of an ass.

222
00:14:22,202 --> 00:14:24,227
Thank you.

223
00:14:24,405 --> 00:14:26,839
May I share something with you
that's troubling me?

224
00:14:27,007 --> 00:14:30,841
Of course. What's rattling around
in that big bulbous brain of yours?

225
00:14:32,012 --> 00:14:36,039
Priya has essentially nullified
my roommate agreement with Leonard...

226
00:14:36,216 --> 00:14:39,413
...making life in the apartment
very uncomfortable for me.

227
00:14:39,586 --> 00:14:42,419
And you want me to kill her? Done.

228
00:14:42,923 --> 00:14:44,185
No, of course not.

229
00:14:44,358 --> 00:14:47,088
I trained Ricky to smoke.
I can train him to shoot a dart.

230
00:14:47,261 --> 00:14:50,992
No jury would convict us
because people love monkeys.

231
00:14:52,633 --> 00:14:57,627
I understand the alcohol has stirred up
whatever it is that makes girls go wild.

232
00:14:58,238 --> 00:15:01,537
But I really need to talk
to smart Amy now.

233
00:15:03,744 --> 00:15:05,473
Excuse me.

234
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:10,742
Have you considered your intelligence
might be causing your dilemma?

235
00:15:16,890 --> 00:15:19,324
- No.
- What do you think Ricky would do...

236
00:15:19,493 --> 00:15:22,394
...if an interloper encroached
on his territory?

237
00:15:22,563 --> 00:15:26,363
Well, when challenged, monkeys
generally assert their dominance...

238
00:15:26,533 --> 00:15:31,664
...through chasing, assault
and a stylized penile display.

239
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:34,069
A little outside my comfort zone.

240
00:15:34,241 --> 00:15:35,572
You're being too literal.

241
00:15:35,742 --> 00:15:39,075
My point is, he would not
meekly surrender to the rules...

242
00:15:39,246 --> 00:15:40,645
...and neither should you.

243
00:15:41,548 --> 00:15:43,573
Are you suggesting I play dirty?

244
00:15:44,017 --> 00:15:45,917
Yes, dirty.

245
00:15:46,086 --> 00:15:50,580
Dirty, dirty, dirty.

246
00:15:53,527 --> 00:15:56,690
Which brings me
to our next order of business.

247
00:16:00,567 --> 00:16:02,159
Fascinating.

248
00:16:03,036 --> 00:16:07,302
I hope you don't take what I'm about
to do as a comment on what we just did.

249
00:16:20,754 --> 00:16:24,588
Who's to say
you shouldn't be dissecting our brains?

250
00:16:25,926 --> 00:16:28,417
You really are an ass.

251
00:16:32,099 --> 00:16:34,761
- Morning, Sheldon.
- Oh, good you're up.

252
00:16:34,935 --> 00:16:38,098
I've written a new and improved
roommate agreement...

253
00:16:38,272 --> 00:16:39,671
...that benefits me greatly.

254
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:41,637
I'd like you to sign it.

255
00:16:43,310 --> 00:16:44,800
Why would I wanna do that?

256
00:16:44,978 --> 00:16:46,468
Excellent question.

257
00:16:46,647 --> 00:16:49,514
Do you remember
what happened to the alien...

258
00:16:49,683 --> 00:16:52,174
...played by character-actor,
Frank Gorshin...

259
00:16:52,352 --> 00:16:56,311
...in the Star Trek episode,
"Let That Be Your Last Battlefield"?

260
00:16:57,224 --> 00:17:00,591
Uh, Captain Kirk
activated the self-destruct sequence...

261
00:17:00,761 --> 00:17:03,594
...and threatened
to blow up the Enterprise and kill them...

262
00:17:03,764 --> 00:17:05,925
...unless he gave in?
- Affirmative.

263
00:17:07,634 --> 00:17:09,932
Computer, this is Dr. Sheldon Cooper.

264
00:17:11,705 --> 00:17:15,607
Activate self-destruct sequence.
Code 1, 1A, 2B.

265
00:17:15,776 --> 00:17:18,574
Self-destruct sequence activated.

266
00:17:23,383 --> 00:17:26,250
What are you gonna do, Sheldon,
blow up the apartment?

267
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:27,785
That was my first thought.

268
00:17:27,955 --> 00:17:30,651
But all my cool stuff is here.

269
00:17:30,824 --> 00:17:33,258
So, what happens
when it counts down?

270
00:17:33,427 --> 00:17:35,793
Unless Leonard
signs the new agreement...

271
00:17:35,963 --> 00:17:37,453
...in the next 41 seconds...

272
00:17:37,631 --> 00:17:41,397
...this computer will send an e-mail
to your parents in India...

273
00:17:41,602 --> 00:17:43,900
...saying
that you're in a secret relationship...

274
00:17:44,104 --> 00:17:47,699
...with the whiter-than-marshmallow-fluff
Leonard Hofstadter.

275
00:17:49,509 --> 00:17:51,534
- Oh, my God.
- What's the big deal?

276
00:17:51,712 --> 00:17:54,977
- Trust me, it's a big deal.
- They're gonna find out eventually...

277
00:17:55,148 --> 00:17:56,809
...right?
- Yeah. Just not today.

278
00:17:56,984 --> 00:17:58,383
Twenty seconds.

279
00:17:58,552 --> 00:18:00,782
- Are you ashamed of me?
- Of course not.

280
00:18:00,954 --> 00:18:03,718
- Why can't we tell your parents?
- Please, don't push this.

281
00:18:03,890 --> 00:18:05,949
He does that all the time. Fifteen.

282
00:18:06,126 --> 00:18:09,118
- Okay, Sheldon, you win. Turn it off.
- No, he's bluffing.

283
00:18:09,296 --> 00:18:10,627
I never bluff. Ten.

284
00:18:10,797 --> 00:18:12,025
- It's blackmail.
- Nine.

285
00:18:12,199 --> 00:18:14,565
- We give up.
- This is ridiculous.

286
00:18:14,735 --> 00:18:17,795
It's a laptop with a full charge.
What do you see in him?

287
00:18:17,971 --> 00:18:20,735
- Give him what he wants or we're done.
- Really?

288
00:18:20,907 --> 00:18:22,340
- Two.
- Okay, I'll sign it.

289
00:18:23,210 --> 00:18:26,543
Self-destruct sequence aborted.

290
00:18:30,851 --> 00:18:33,911
You may have gone to Cambridge,
but I am an honorary graduate...

291
00:18:34,087 --> 00:18:36,021
...of Starfleet Academy.

292
00:18:48,969 --> 00:18:50,596
Good morning, Amy.

293
00:18:54,441 --> 00:18:56,932
It most assuredly is not.

294
00:18:57,511 --> 00:19:03,472
Are you experiencing dehydration,
headache, nausea and shame?

295
00:19:04,317 --> 00:19:05,409
Yes.

296
00:19:05,585 --> 00:19:09,988
I also found a Korean man's
business card tucked into my cleavage.

297
00:19:11,091 --> 00:19:12,319
What happened last night?

298
00:19:12,492 --> 00:19:14,426
Oh, memory impairment.

299
00:19:14,594 --> 00:19:18,621
The free prize at the bottom
of every vodka bottle.

300
00:19:19,166 --> 00:19:21,828
- Sheldon.
- All right.

301
00:19:22,169 --> 00:19:24,660
Last night,
you gave me some excellent advice...

302
00:19:24,838 --> 00:19:27,864
...regarding my problem here at home.
You kissed me...

303
00:19:28,041 --> 00:19:31,704
...and then vomited on and off
for 40 minutes...

304
00:19:31,912 --> 00:19:34,380
...following which
you passed out on your floor.

305
00:19:34,548 --> 00:19:37,381
I then folded a towel under your head
as a pillow...

306
00:19:37,551 --> 00:19:41,647
...set your oven clock to the correct time
because it was driving me crazy...

307
00:19:43,123 --> 00:19:44,317
...and I left.

308
00:19:45,192 --> 00:19:46,682
Okay.

309
00:19:48,295 --> 00:19:50,627
Don't really know
where we go from here.

310
00:19:52,032 --> 00:19:56,128
I suggest we treat our relationship
as if it were a crashed computer...

311
00:19:56,303 --> 00:19:59,500
...and restore it to the last point
we both agree it worked.

312
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:02,208
Terrific. Thank you.

313
00:20:03,844 --> 00:20:07,177
They were out of menthols.
Get off my back.

314
00:20:10,884 --> 00:20:13,375
Not easy living
with a temperamental little primate.

315
00:20:13,553 --> 00:20:15,748
Come on, Priya, just admit I embarrass you.

316
00:20:15,922 --> 00:20:18,516
You're preaching to the choir, sister.
