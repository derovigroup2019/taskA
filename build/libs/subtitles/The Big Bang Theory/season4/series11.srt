1
00:00:09,129 --> 00:00:11,154
Water Demon.

2
00:00:12,299 --> 00:00:13,357
Ice Dragon.

3
00:00:14,902 --> 00:00:17,700
Lesser Warlord of Ka'a.

4
00:00:17,871 --> 00:00:20,305
Not so fast.

5
00:00:20,807 --> 00:00:22,331
Infinite Sheldon.

6
00:00:24,478 --> 00:00:25,706
Infinite Sheldon?

7
00:00:25,879 --> 00:00:28,712
Yes. Infinite Sheldon defeats
all other cards...

8
00:00:28,882 --> 00:00:32,841
...and does not violate the rule against
homemade cards. I made it at work.

9
00:00:35,155 --> 00:00:37,680
You understand why people
don't wanna play with you?

10
00:00:37,858 --> 00:00:39,189
No.

11
00:00:39,359 --> 00:00:42,556
Although it's a question
I've been pondering since preschool.

12
00:00:44,164 --> 00:00:45,756
- Hey.
- Hey.

13
00:00:45,933 --> 00:00:47,662
Hey.

14
00:00:47,834 --> 00:00:50,530
Hey, your copy of Science magazine
was in my mailbox.

15
00:00:50,704 --> 00:00:51,932
- Oh, thanks.
- Check it out.

16
00:00:52,139 --> 00:00:53,538
All about planets this month.

17
00:00:54,374 --> 00:00:55,500
That's an atom.

18
00:00:57,177 --> 00:00:59,008
Agree to disagree.

19
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:04,141
There's no one right answer.

20
00:01:08,522 --> 00:01:12,856
- So you and Zack again, huh?
- Yeah, yeah, me and Zack again.

21
00:01:13,026 --> 00:01:14,220
Were we here earlier?

22
00:01:16,663 --> 00:01:18,290
- Okay, we should go.
- Not yet.

23
00:01:18,465 --> 00:01:20,729
I wanna talk science
with the science dudes.

24
00:01:20,901 --> 00:01:24,268
Oh, and the science dudes
wanna talk science with you.

25
00:01:26,039 --> 00:01:28,599
What do you wanna talk about?
Rocks? Dinosaurs?

26
00:01:28,775 --> 00:01:30,902
Our friend the beaver?

27
00:01:32,379 --> 00:01:34,711
I saw this great thing
on the Discovery Channel.

28
00:01:34,881 --> 00:01:38,408
Turns out that if you kill a starfish,
it'll just come back to life.

29
00:01:40,587 --> 00:01:42,384
Was the starfish wearing
boxer shorts?

30
00:01:42,556 --> 00:01:45,252
Because you might've been watching
Nickelodeon.

31
00:01:47,694 --> 00:01:51,494
No, I'm almost sure
that it was the Discovery Channel.

32
00:01:51,698 --> 00:01:55,259
It was a great show. They also said
dolphins might be smarter than people.

33
00:01:55,435 --> 00:01:57,767
They might be smarter
than some people.

34
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:02,672
Well, maybe we can do an experiment
to find out.

35
00:02:02,843 --> 00:02:04,105
That's easy enough.

36
00:02:04,277 --> 00:02:07,303
We'd need a large tank of water,
a hoop to jump through...

37
00:02:07,481 --> 00:02:11,815
...and a bucket of whatever
bite-size treats you find tasty.

38
00:02:18,225 --> 00:02:20,159
I don't get it.

39
00:02:20,327 --> 00:02:21,453
A dolphin might.

40
00:02:25,866 --> 00:02:28,334
Oh, I see.
You guys are inferring that I'm stupid.

41
00:02:28,502 --> 00:02:32,029
That's not correct.
We were implying it.

42
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:34,607
You then inferred it.

43
00:02:38,779 --> 00:02:40,508
Let's go.

44
00:02:42,749 --> 00:02:45,741
For a group of guys who claim
they spent most of their lives...

45
00:02:45,919 --> 00:02:49,650
...being bullied, you can be real jerks.
Shame on all of you.

46
00:02:52,659 --> 00:02:54,854
What the hell did I do?

47
00:02:55,696 --> 00:02:56,993
You laughed.

48
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:04,074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

49
00:03:23,924 --> 00:03:26,586
You think Penny's right?
Were we bullying Zack?

50
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:28,387
No. I know bullying.

51
00:03:28,562 --> 00:03:32,589
He left here unswirlied,
and his ass crack was underpants-free.

52
00:03:33,767 --> 00:03:35,632
And nobody drew a penis
on his forehead.

53
00:03:38,839 --> 00:03:39,931
That happened to you?

54
00:03:40,941 --> 00:03:42,704
First day of Cricket Camp.

55
00:03:42,876 --> 00:03:45,868
They drew it
so the testicles were my eyes.

56
00:03:49,549 --> 00:03:52,040
I don't know,
we might owe the guy an apology.

57
00:03:52,219 --> 00:03:53,709
So go apologize.

58
00:03:53,887 --> 00:03:57,653
- Why me?
- You started it. We just piled on.

59
00:03:58,391 --> 00:04:02,157
- What would I even say?
- "Zack, I'm sorry you're stupid.

60
00:04:04,998 --> 00:04:07,091
Have a Milk Dud."

61
00:04:08,268 --> 00:04:09,496
- A Milk Dud?
- Yeah.

62
00:04:09,669 --> 00:04:11,933
Milk Duds,
with their self-deprecating name...

63
00:04:12,105 --> 00:04:13,732
...and remarkably mild flavor...

64
00:04:13,907 --> 00:04:17,365
...are the most apologetic
of the boxed candies.

65
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:22,175
Well, I got a better idea.
We're all responsible. I say we all go.

66
00:04:24,918 --> 00:04:26,180
Come on, who's with me?

67
00:04:28,321 --> 00:04:31,290
Free comic books
to anyone who comes with me.

68
00:04:32,959 --> 00:04:35,621
I might get punched.
You really wanna miss that?

69
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:44,898
- Junior Mints are pretty apologetic.
- You're embarrassing yourself.

70
00:04:48,942 --> 00:04:50,432
Penny.

71
00:04:55,849 --> 00:04:58,147
- What?
- We came to talk to Zack. Hey, Zack.

72
00:04:58,985 --> 00:05:00,043
What do you want?

73
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:03,348
The stuff we were saying before,
we were just kidding around.

74
00:05:03,523 --> 00:05:05,991
No, you weren't.
You were making fun of me.

75
00:05:06,159 --> 00:05:09,925
Come on. That's what we do.
We give each other a hard time.

76
00:05:10,096 --> 00:05:12,997
Hey, Sheldon,
you look like a praying mantis.

77
00:05:15,502 --> 00:05:17,800
- That's very hurtful.
- See?

78
00:05:19,206 --> 00:05:21,197
I don't know. Still wasn't very nice.

79
00:05:21,975 --> 00:05:23,670
Milk Dud?

80
00:05:23,844 --> 00:05:25,311
Oh, I love Milk Duds.

81
00:05:27,147 --> 00:05:28,978
Okay, we're cool.

82
00:05:30,951 --> 00:05:33,351
Junior Mints.

83
00:05:33,987 --> 00:05:36,046
- You wanna have a beer?
- We're on our way...

84
00:05:36,223 --> 00:05:38,885
...to the comic-book store, so...
- Leonard's buying.

85
00:05:39,059 --> 00:05:42,688
Really? I haven't been to a comic-book
store in literally a million years.

86
00:05:43,463 --> 00:05:47,593
Literally? Literally a million years?

87
00:05:48,001 --> 00:05:49,332
Don't.

88
00:05:49,502 --> 00:05:50,833
- You wanna go with them?
- No.

89
00:05:51,004 --> 00:05:53,973
- Okay, see you later.
- What...? Wait, wait, wait.

90
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:56,768
You're ditching me
to go look at comic books?

91
00:05:56,977 --> 00:06:00,174
- Are you mad at me?
- I'm not happy.

92
00:06:02,215 --> 00:06:03,614
Milk Dud?

93
00:06:07,754 --> 00:06:09,551
Wow, this place is awesome.

94
00:06:10,023 --> 00:06:11,854
Where do they keep the Archies?

95
00:06:12,592 --> 00:06:16,221
In the bedrooms of 10-year-old girls,
where they belong.

96
00:06:16,396 --> 00:06:19,854
You're thinking old-school Archie.
It's much more sophisticated now.

97
00:06:20,033 --> 00:06:21,364
Like, there's two universes.

98
00:06:21,534 --> 00:06:24,367
Archie's married to Betty in one
and Veronica in the other.

99
00:06:24,537 --> 00:06:28,200
- Midge is even breaking up with Moose.
- No.

100
00:06:28,708 --> 00:06:29,868
About time, right?

101
00:06:30,911 --> 00:06:32,208
- Hey.
- Hey.

102
00:06:32,379 --> 00:06:34,711
You guys finally chip in
for a bodyguard?

103
00:06:36,583 --> 00:06:39,711
No. This is Zack.
He's a friend of ours.

104
00:06:39,886 --> 00:06:42,013
Zack, this is Stuart.
He owns the store.

105
00:06:42,188 --> 00:06:43,712
Wow, lucky you.

106
00:06:43,890 --> 00:06:49,294
Yeah. I work 70 hours a week
and average $1.65 an hour.

107
00:06:50,063 --> 00:06:51,462
Sweet.

108
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:54,765
Is that sarcasm?

109
00:06:54,935 --> 00:06:58,268
No, it's an indictment
of the American education system.

110
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:02,668
- The Archies are over here.
- Yippee.

111
00:07:04,911 --> 00:07:07,675
So are you guys coming
to my New Year's Eve costume party?

112
00:07:07,847 --> 00:07:10,941
Of course. We're coming
as the Justice League of America.

113
00:07:11,117 --> 00:07:15,645
Switching it up from last year when we
came as the Justice League of America.

114
00:07:15,822 --> 00:07:20,156
To that point, it occurs to me
that we might have an opportunity...

115
00:07:20,327 --> 00:07:22,591
...to finally snare
Best Group Costume...

116
00:07:22,762 --> 00:07:27,597
...if we shore up our weak link,
which is clearly Leonard as Superman.

117
00:07:29,069 --> 00:07:33,062
Hey, I got new boots this year.
Guaranteed to add 3 inches.

118
00:07:34,107 --> 00:07:35,768
That's sad.

119
00:07:37,277 --> 00:07:40,804
Let's ask ourselves,
is there anyone we know...

120
00:07:40,981 --> 00:07:45,611
...who would make a more manly
and convincing son of Krypton?

121
00:07:45,785 --> 00:07:47,685
Than Leonard in high-heeled boots?

122
00:07:49,456 --> 00:07:51,822
Howard's mother
in high-heeled boots?

123
00:07:54,828 --> 00:07:58,286
I was thinking specifically
of the gentleman over there...

124
00:07:58,465 --> 00:08:03,459
...moving his lips as he enjoys
the latest exploits of Betty and Veronica.

125
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:07,901
Zack?

126
00:08:08,108 --> 00:08:11,703
He's the only person we know
with actual muscles.

127
00:08:12,512 --> 00:08:14,639
You can't replace me with Zack.

128
00:08:14,814 --> 00:08:17,305
Why not? Penny did it.

129
00:08:18,118 --> 00:08:20,848
Yeah. She seems happier.
Why wouldn't we be?

130
00:08:21,821 --> 00:08:25,757
Score. I got an Archie,
Betty and Veronica, and a Jughead.

131
00:08:25,925 --> 00:08:28,519
All set for my weekend number twos.

132
00:08:30,030 --> 00:08:31,827
Congratulations.

133
00:08:31,998 --> 00:08:35,331
Zack, how would you like
to be Superman?

134
00:08:36,269 --> 00:08:39,568
I don't know.
Sounds like a lot of responsibility.

135
00:08:43,009 --> 00:08:45,910
Fine, if Zack's gonna be Superman,
I wanna be Green Lantern.

136
00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:48,343
- But I'm Green Lantern.
- You can be Aquaman.

137
00:08:48,515 --> 00:08:52,076
I don't wanna be Aquaman. He sucks.

138
00:08:52,952 --> 00:08:55,512
He sucks underwater.

139
00:08:56,356 --> 00:08:58,722
He sucks fish pee.

140
00:08:59,192 --> 00:09:03,754
Excuse me. I believe Aquaman
uses his telepathic powers...

141
00:09:03,930 --> 00:09:07,696
...to request the fish do their business
elsewhere.

142
00:09:08,401 --> 00:09:10,369
- Hey, babe.
- I'm still mad at you.

143
00:09:10,537 --> 00:09:12,471
You won't be
when you hear the great news.

144
00:09:12,672 --> 00:09:15,163
- What great news?
- We're going to a costume party...

145
00:09:15,341 --> 00:09:17,639
...at the comic-book store
on New Year's Eve...

146
00:09:17,811 --> 00:09:20,279
...and you get to be Wonder Woman.

147
00:09:21,881 --> 00:09:24,816
Complete with bulletproof bracelets
and Lasso of Truth.

148
00:09:25,718 --> 00:09:27,549
Invisible Plane sold separately.

149
00:09:28,922 --> 00:09:32,085
Okay, why me? Why can't your girlfriend
be Wonder Woman?

150
00:09:32,258 --> 00:09:34,818
Yeah, well, she and her lab team
are under quarantine.

151
00:09:34,994 --> 00:09:38,623
At the Christmas party, they were doing
Jell-O shots out of Petri dishes...

152
00:09:38,798 --> 00:09:41,062
...that used to contain yellow fever.

153
00:09:42,635 --> 00:09:45,297
Okay. Well, what about
your friend Amy?

154
00:09:45,472 --> 00:09:48,270
Amy Farrah Fowler doesn't believe
in wearing costumes.

155
00:09:48,441 --> 00:09:51,274
She isn't the free spirit I am.

156
00:09:54,447 --> 00:09:57,780
Forget it. I'm not spending my
New Year's Eve at a comic-book store...

157
00:09:57,951 --> 00:09:59,646
...wearing a Wonder Woman costume.

158
00:10:01,621 --> 00:10:04,784
He says he'll wear it
if you'll be Aquaman.

159
00:10:19,339 --> 00:10:21,204
What are you doing?

160
00:10:21,374 --> 00:10:25,140
We're going to be late.
I'm pacing nervously.

161
00:10:25,311 --> 00:10:29,645
- You're jogging.
- This is how the Flash paces.

162
00:10:30,383 --> 00:10:34,342
- Just chill out, Sheldon.
- I'm not Sheldon, I'm the Flash.

163
00:10:35,522 --> 00:10:38,980
And now I'm going to the Grand Canyon
to scream in frustration.

164
00:10:39,159 --> 00:10:40,319
I'm back.

165
00:10:43,796 --> 00:10:45,991
I'm Batman.

166
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,395
I hardly think so.
The real Caped Crusader...

167
00:10:49,602 --> 00:10:53,129
...calls his crime-fighting cohorts
when he's running late.

168
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:54,968
I had to walk.

169
00:10:55,141 --> 00:10:57,371
I couldn't get Raj
on the back of my scooter.

170
00:11:05,552 --> 00:11:09,716
Aquaman sucks.

171
00:11:09,889 --> 00:11:11,516
Look up in the sky.

172
00:11:11,691 --> 00:11:14,057
It's a bird. It's a plane!

173
00:11:15,395 --> 00:11:17,522
I forget the rest.

174
00:11:18,431 --> 00:11:20,831
All right, let's get this thing over with.

175
00:11:23,069 --> 00:11:27,233
I'm sorry, but in what universe
is Wonder Woman blond?

176
00:11:27,874 --> 00:11:31,173
Relax. No one's gonna be
looking at her hair.

177
00:11:33,146 --> 00:11:34,841
Ow!

178
00:11:36,416 --> 00:11:37,405
I mean:

179
00:11:37,584 --> 00:11:38,778
Ow.

180
00:11:40,687 --> 00:11:42,746
Costume came with a black wig.
Where is it?

181
00:11:42,922 --> 00:11:46,358
- I'm not wearing it. It looks stupid.
- We're trying to win a contest.

182
00:11:46,526 --> 00:11:51,657
- Forget it. I'm not wearing the wig.
- Penny, there's no I in "Justice League."

183
00:11:54,534 --> 00:11:58,800
- Well, actually...
- Don't. He's making our case.

184
00:11:59,772 --> 00:12:03,606
Okay, babe, you're kind of embarrassing
me in front of my friends.

185
00:12:04,544 --> 00:12:07,445
Okay, you know what?
I changed my mind. I'm not going.

186
00:12:09,882 --> 00:12:13,477
Looks like someone else
is gonna have to be Wonder Woman.

187
00:12:18,291 --> 00:12:21,283
- Babe, open up.
- I'm not talking to you.

188
00:12:22,061 --> 00:12:24,222
Then who are you talking to?

189
00:12:27,567 --> 00:12:29,194
Babe?

190
00:12:29,769 --> 00:12:32,738
Penny. Penny. Penny.

191
00:12:32,905 --> 00:12:35,396
Penny. Penny. Penny.

192
00:12:35,575 --> 00:12:37,805
Penny. Penny. Penny.

193
00:12:37,977 --> 00:12:40,639
What the hell is wrong with you?

194
00:12:41,014 --> 00:12:43,574
I'm the Flash.
I just knocked 30,000 times.

195
00:12:44,584 --> 00:12:48,520
- Okay, what do you want, Sheldon?
- I understand why you're upset.

196
00:12:49,222 --> 00:12:51,122
- Really?
- Yes.

197
00:12:51,291 --> 00:12:54,454
You're afraid that costume
makes you look fat.

198
00:12:56,963 --> 00:13:01,127
No. Wha...? Does it?

199
00:13:01,834 --> 00:13:05,167
Don't worry.
Wonder Woman was an Amazon.

200
00:13:05,338 --> 00:13:08,603
And Amazons
tend to be very beefy gals.

201
00:13:11,311 --> 00:13:13,506
Goodbye, Sheldon.

202
00:13:15,648 --> 00:13:18,674
But they're not blond,
so put on your wig.

203
00:13:22,288 --> 00:13:23,846
Hello?

204
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:36,900
Stupid Aquaman.

205
00:13:38,838 --> 00:13:41,466
If it makes you feel better,
when I was dating Penny...

206
00:13:41,641 --> 00:13:43,802
...she used to flip out on me
all the time.

207
00:13:43,976 --> 00:13:45,170
Whoa, you dated Penny?

208
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:48,706
She didn't tell you?

209
00:13:48,881 --> 00:13:50,872
She told me she dated a guy
named Leonard.

210
00:13:51,050 --> 00:13:53,041
Who would've thought it was you?

211
00:13:54,354 --> 00:13:55,719
Who else would it be?

212
00:13:56,222 --> 00:13:59,191
I don't know, somebody bigger and...

213
00:13:59,359 --> 00:14:01,850
Yeah, sure. Why not you?

214
00:14:04,997 --> 00:14:07,056
I may have failed.

215
00:14:07,233 --> 00:14:10,725
Okay. I guess we just go
without a Wonder Woman.

216
00:14:10,903 --> 00:14:13,667
- I don't wanna go without Penny.
- Oh, great.

217
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:15,671
No Superman, no Wonder Woman.

218
00:14:15,842 --> 00:14:18,743
All we've got is a skinny Flash,
an Indian Aquaman...

219
00:14:18,911 --> 00:14:23,405
...a nearsighted Green Lantern,
and a teeny-tiny Dark Knight.

220
00:14:25,418 --> 00:14:28,114
Well, obviously,
we're no longer a Justice League.

221
00:14:28,321 --> 00:14:32,417
We have no choice but to switch
to our Muppet Baby costumes.

222
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:38,458
- I call Kermit.
- I'm Kermit. You're Scooter.

223
00:14:38,631 --> 00:14:41,759
Oh, man, Scooter sucks.

224
00:14:42,335 --> 00:14:45,463
He's the Aquaman
of the Muppet Babies.

225
00:14:47,273 --> 00:14:50,936
No, we can still make this work.
Leonard, you talk to Penny.

226
00:14:51,110 --> 00:14:53,044
What makes you think
I can convince her?

227
00:14:53,212 --> 00:14:54,839
You got her to have sex with you.

228
00:14:55,014 --> 00:14:57,710
Obviously your superpower
is brainwashing.

229
00:15:00,853 --> 00:15:03,583
Okay, let me see if I understand this.

230
00:15:03,756 --> 00:15:07,453
You want me to convince my
ex-girlfriend to go to a costume party...

231
00:15:07,627 --> 00:15:10,790
...with her new boyfriend
just so we can win a stupid prize?

232
00:15:10,963 --> 00:15:13,431
Yes. And make her wear the black wig.
Good luck.

233
00:15:16,235 --> 00:15:18,760
- Go away, Sheldon.
- It's Leonard.

234
00:15:19,138 --> 00:15:22,107
Oh. Go away, Leonard.

235
00:15:22,809 --> 00:15:25,437
Come on, let me just talk to you.

236
00:15:25,611 --> 00:15:26,737
It's open.

237
00:15:28,181 --> 00:15:30,308
- Hey.
- I'm not going to that party, Leonard.

238
00:15:30,483 --> 00:15:32,951
Okay, listen,
you don't have to wear the wig.

239
00:15:33,119 --> 00:15:36,885
At this party, we're gonna win first prize
just by showing up with a girl.

240
00:15:38,491 --> 00:15:39,981
It's not the wig.

241
00:15:40,159 --> 00:15:43,492
Did I do something?
I mean, I tried to be friends with Zack...

242
00:15:43,663 --> 00:15:46,325
...like you said,
which, believe me, was difficult.

243
00:15:46,499 --> 00:15:49,161
Given how you and me used to be,
you know, you and me...

244
00:15:49,335 --> 00:15:52,463
...and now you and him
are you and him.

245
00:15:53,306 --> 00:15:55,604
Okay, look,
we're not really "me and him."

246
00:15:56,309 --> 00:15:59,403
- Then what are you?
- I don't know.

247
00:15:59,579 --> 00:16:04,209
I only started seeing Zack again so
I wouldn't be alone on New Year's Eve.

248
00:16:04,417 --> 00:16:05,679
How pathetic is that?

249
00:16:06,118 --> 00:16:08,177
Not as pathetic
as dressing up like this...

250
00:16:08,354 --> 00:16:11,323
...and going to a comic-book store
on New Year's Eve.

251
00:16:11,991 --> 00:16:13,822
You make a cute Green Arrow.

252
00:16:19,632 --> 00:16:20,997
Green Lantern.

253
00:16:22,168 --> 00:16:24,136
Like there's a difference.

254
00:16:24,704 --> 00:16:26,137
There's a big difference.

255
00:16:26,305 --> 00:16:28,034
Arrow.

256
00:16:28,207 --> 00:16:29,834
Lantern.

257
00:16:33,079 --> 00:16:37,175
If Zack and I had just gone to a regular
club or a party, it would've been fine.

258
00:16:37,350 --> 00:16:40,683
- But this, with the costumes and you...
- What about me?

259
00:16:44,657 --> 00:16:47,490
Nothing. Let's go to the party.

260
00:16:49,362 --> 00:16:51,353
How do I look?

261
00:16:55,668 --> 00:16:57,158
Um...

262
00:16:57,336 --> 00:16:59,566
I guarantee you'll be
the prettiest girl there.

263
00:17:01,741 --> 00:17:04,175
Okay, the good news is,
we have a Wonder Woman.

264
00:17:04,343 --> 00:17:06,334
- Yes.
- What's the bad news?

265
00:17:06,512 --> 00:17:09,413
Superman probably
isn't getting laid tonight.

266
00:17:11,584 --> 00:17:13,575
Oh, damn.

267
00:17:15,988 --> 00:17:20,049
And the award for Best Group Costume
goes to...

268
00:17:21,427 --> 00:17:23,054
...Justice League of America...

269
00:17:29,068 --> 00:17:30,899
...number three!

270
00:17:33,439 --> 00:17:36,408
Thank you! Thank you so much!

271
00:17:36,576 --> 00:17:39,238
Okay, okay. Ten seconds to midnight.

272
00:17:39,412 --> 00:17:43,109
- Ten. Nine. Eight. Seven.
- No, wait, I have a speech.

273
00:17:43,282 --> 00:17:45,750
- Six. Five. Four.
- Stop counting.

274
00:17:45,918 --> 00:17:48,751
- This is my moment, dagnabbit.
- Three. Two. One.

275
00:17:48,921 --> 00:17:51,617
Happy New Year!

276
00:18:04,036 --> 00:18:08,336
I'm not going to say another
word until you people settle down!

277
00:18:11,444 --> 00:18:13,309
I'm waiting.

278
00:18:16,816 --> 00:18:19,182
That was a great party.

279
00:18:19,352 --> 00:18:21,320
We should dress like this all the time.

280
00:18:22,555 --> 00:18:24,147
Are you high?

281
00:18:24,323 --> 00:18:26,814
You're being a bully.

282
00:18:29,996 --> 00:18:33,090
Whoa, check it out,
those guys are breaking into that car.

283
00:18:33,265 --> 00:18:34,857
What should we do?

284
00:18:35,067 --> 00:18:39,436
We're the Justice League of America.
There's only one thing we can do:

285
00:18:39,605 --> 00:18:41,698
Turn around and slowly walk away.

286
00:18:50,416 --> 00:18:52,043
Nah!

287
00:18:52,518 --> 00:18:54,145
Hold up.

288
00:19:00,026 --> 00:19:02,927
Look, I know our winter thermostat
setting is 72 degrees...

289
00:19:03,129 --> 00:19:05,927
...but I'm a little warm,
so I'm gonna turn it down.

290
00:19:30,189 --> 00:19:35,923
Good Lord, how you frustrate me,
Leonard Hofstadter!

291
00:19:53,612 --> 00:19:55,273
Fine.

292
