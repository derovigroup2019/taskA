1
00:00:02,775 --> 00:00:04,042
Whatcha doin' there?

2
00:00:04,048 --> 00:00:05,983
Working on a new plan
to catch the roadrunner?

3
00:00:05,984 --> 00:00:11,421
The humorous implication being
that I am Wile E. Coyote?

4
00:00:11,422 --> 00:00:14,074
Yes.

5
00:00:14,075 --> 00:00:16,660
And this is a schematic
for a bird-trapping device

6
00:00:16,661 --> 00:00:20,614
that will ultimately backfire
and cause me physical injury?

7
00:00:20,615 --> 00:00:22,899
Yes.

8
00:00:27,755 --> 00:00:29,039
What I'm doing here

9
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:31,925
is trying to determine
when I'm going to die.

10
00:00:31,926 --> 00:00:35,462
A lot of people are working
on that research.

11
00:00:35,463 --> 00:00:38,215
So what is all this?

12
00:00:38,216 --> 00:00:41,101
My family history
factoring in longevity,

13
00:00:41,102 --> 00:00:43,520
propensity for disease,
et cetera.

14
00:00:43,521 --> 00:00:44,588
Interesting.

15
00:00:44,589 --> 00:00:46,773
Cause of death for
Uncle Carl was KBB.

16
00:00:46,774 --> 00:00:47,808
What's "KBB"?

17
00:00:47,809 --> 00:00:51,145
"Killed by badger."

18
00:00:51,146 --> 00:00:52,880
How's that?

19
00:00:52,881 --> 00:00:54,948
It was Thanksgiving.

20
00:00:54,949 --> 00:00:56,950
Uncle Carl said, "I think

21
00:00:56,951 --> 00:00:59,586
"there's a badger living
in our chimney.

22
00:00:59,587 --> 00:01:01,488
Hand me that flashlight."

23
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:03,941
Those were the last words

24
00:01:03,942 --> 00:01:05,742
he ever spoke to us.

25
00:01:05,743 --> 00:01:07,127
I don't think you need

26
00:01:07,128 --> 00:01:10,130
to worry about death by badgers
being hereditary.

27
00:01:10,131 --> 00:01:11,598
Not true.

28
00:01:11,599 --> 00:01:14,301
The fight or flight instinct
is coded genetically.

29
00:01:14,302 --> 00:01:18,322
Instead of fleeing, he chose
to fight barehanded

30
00:01:18,323 --> 00:01:20,974
against a brawny member
of the weasel family.

31
00:01:20,975 --> 00:01:24,228
Who's to say that I don't share
that flawed DNA?

32
00:01:24,229 --> 00:01:26,796
You can always get a badger
and find out.

33
00:01:30,652 --> 00:01:32,402
But seriously,

34
00:01:32,403 --> 00:01:35,072
even if I disregard
the Uncle Carl factor,

35
00:01:35,073 --> 00:01:37,524
at best I have 60 years left.

36
00:01:37,525 --> 00:01:40,127
That long, huh?

37
00:01:40,128 --> 00:01:41,778
60 only takes me to here.

38
00:01:41,779 --> 00:01:43,980
I need to get to here.

39
00:01:43,981 --> 00:01:45,832
What's there?

40
00:01:45,833 --> 00:01:48,619
The earliest estimate
of the singularity,

41
00:01:48,620 --> 00:01:50,837
when man will be able
to transfer his consciousness

42
00:01:50,838 --> 00:01:53,557
into machines
and achieve immortality.

43
00:01:53,558 --> 00:01:56,977
So, you're upset
about missing out

44
00:01:56,978 --> 00:01:59,696
on becoming some sort of
freakish self-aware robot?

45
00:01:59,697 --> 00:02:02,716
By this much.

46
00:02:03,851 --> 00:02:04,885
Tough break.

47
00:02:04,886 --> 00:02:06,002
You want eggs?

48
00:02:06,003 --> 00:02:07,771
You don't get it, Leonard.

49
00:02:07,772 --> 00:02:10,357
I'm going to miss so much--

50
00:02:10,358 --> 00:02:15,896
the unified field theory,
cold fusion, the dogapus.

51
00:02:15,897 --> 00:02:17,514
What's a dogapus?

52
00:02:17,515 --> 00:02:20,701
The hybrid dog and octopus.

53
00:02:20,702 --> 00:02:22,669
Man's underwater best friend.

54
00:02:24,789 --> 00:02:26,240
Is somebody
working on that?

55
00:02:26,241 --> 00:02:27,524
I was going to.

56
00:02:27,525 --> 00:02:31,194
I planned on giving it to myself
on my 300th birthday.

57
00:02:31,195 --> 00:02:33,247
Wait a minute.
You hate dogs.

58
00:02:33,248 --> 00:02:36,583
A dogapus can play fetch
with eight balls.

59
00:02:36,584 --> 00:02:38,268
No one can hate that.

60
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:43,340
? Our whole universe
was in a hot, dense state ?

61
00:02:43,341 --> 00:02:46,810
? Then nearly 14 billion years
ago expansion started... Wait! ?

62
00:02:46,811 --> 00:02:48,528
? The Earth began to cool ?

63
00:02:48,529 --> 00:02:51,131
? The autotrophs began to drool,
Neanderthals developed tools ?

64
00:02:51,132 --> 00:02:53,767
? We built the Wall ?
? <i>We built the pyramids</i> ?

65
00:02:53,768 --> 00:02:56,153
? Math, Science, History,
unraveling the mystery ?

66
00:02:56,154 --> 00:02:58,054
? That all started
with a big bang ?

67
00:02:58,055 --> 00:02:58,607
? <i>Bang!</i> ?

70
00:03:08,398 --> 00:03:09,098
What do we owe you?

71
00:03:09,112 --> 00:03:11,197
It came to $28.17.

72
00:03:11,198 --> 00:03:12,331
Let's say six bucks apiece.

73
00:03:12,332 --> 00:03:14,083
Here you go.

74
00:03:14,084 --> 00:03:16,736
Thank you.

75
00:03:18,955 --> 00:03:21,457
What?

76
00:03:21,458 --> 00:03:22,758
Never mind. I got it.

77
00:03:22,759 --> 00:03:24,293
Oh, you wanted me to pay.

78
00:03:24,294 --> 00:03:26,545
It's no big deal.
No, no, no, no.
You're right.

79
00:03:26,546 --> 00:03:28,964
We're not going out anymore;
I should pay for myself.

80
00:03:31,268 --> 00:03:32,935
What?

81
00:03:32,936 --> 00:03:35,254
He said, "If he had
woman parts,

82
00:03:35,255 --> 00:03:38,841
he'd eat for free
the rest of his life""

83
00:03:38,842 --> 00:03:42,027
Yeah, but you wouldn't be able
to talk to yourself.

84
00:03:44,281 --> 00:03:46,665
I'm a little low on cash.

85
00:03:46,666 --> 00:03:48,751
How much you got?
Nothing.

86
00:03:48,752 --> 00:03:50,286
How can you walk
around with no money?

87
00:03:50,287 --> 00:03:51,937
I'm cute. I get by.

88
00:03:51,938 --> 00:03:53,706
It's okay,
you can owe me.

89
00:03:53,707 --> 00:03:54,940
Thank you.
Sheldon, six bucks.

90
00:03:54,941 --> 00:03:58,711
No, thank you.
I'm not eating pizza tonight.

91
00:03:58,712 --> 00:03:59,795
But it's Thursday.

92
00:03:59,796 --> 00:04:01,446
Thursday's pizza night.

93
00:04:01,447 --> 00:04:02,531
Not for me.

94
00:04:02,532 --> 00:04:05,617
Thursday is now Cruciferous
Vegetable Night.

95
00:04:05,618 --> 00:04:08,971
Tonight's selection:
Brussels sprouts.

96
00:04:08,972 --> 00:04:10,089
Really?

97
00:04:10,090 --> 00:04:12,808
You're changing the
Sheldonian calendar?

98
00:04:12,809 --> 00:04:15,928
It's a small price to pay.
For what?

99
00:04:15,929 --> 00:04:18,464
No, no, don't ask.
Sorry, sorry, sorry,
sorry, sorry.

100
00:04:18,465 --> 00:04:20,766
In order to live long enough
to fuse my consciousness

101
00:04:20,767 --> 00:04:23,402
with cybernetics,
I need to change my diet.

102
00:04:23,403 --> 00:04:25,654
Wait. Cybernetics is
robot stuff, right?

103
00:04:25,655 --> 00:04:26,638
Correct.

104
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:28,073
So you want to turn yourself

105
00:04:28,074 --> 00:04:29,141
into some sort of robot?

106
00:04:29,142 --> 00:04:31,343
Essentially, yes.

107
00:04:31,344 --> 00:04:32,611
Okay, here's my question.

108
00:04:32,612 --> 00:04:34,029
Didn't you already do that?

109
00:04:34,030 --> 00:04:35,331
No.

110
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:39,001
Flattering, but sadly, no.

111
00:04:39,002 --> 00:04:42,487
I'm also planning
to begin an exercise regimen

112
00:04:42,488 --> 00:04:44,924
designed to strengthen
my cardiovascular system.

113
00:04:44,925 --> 00:04:47,176
AKA jogging.

114
00:04:47,177 --> 00:04:48,761
Wait. Honey,
have you ever run before?

115
00:04:48,762 --> 00:04:50,029
Certainly.

116
00:04:50,030 --> 00:04:54,250
I've run from bullies, dogs,
angry chickens...

117
00:04:55,185 --> 00:04:57,887
and one particularly
persistent P.E. teacher

118
00:04:57,888 --> 00:05:01,173
determined to bend me over
and give me a scoliosis test.

119
00:05:04,861 --> 00:05:06,278
You're right.
Penny jogs.

120
00:05:06,279 --> 00:05:07,830
Maybe you guys
can run together.

121
00:05:07,831 --> 00:05:10,199
That's an excellent idea.

122
00:05:12,719 --> 00:05:13,953
Yeah, if we chat,

123
00:05:13,954 --> 00:05:16,188
it will create the illusion
of time going faster.

124
00:05:16,189 --> 00:05:18,190
No, it won't.

125
00:05:19,242 --> 00:05:21,377
Um, how does he know I jog?

126
00:05:21,378 --> 00:05:25,697
Oh, he watches you from his car
with high-powered binoculars.

127
00:05:25,698 --> 00:05:27,550
Oh, my God, that is so creepy!

128
00:05:27,551 --> 00:05:29,218
I know!

129
00:05:32,589 --> 00:05:34,924
And he says he's
not gonna stop.

130
00:05:37,811 --> 00:05:41,564
Then see a shrink
and figure out how
to talk to women.

132
00:05:52,609 --> 00:05:54,693
What the hell?

133
00:05:57,747 --> 00:05:59,031
What's the matter?

134
00:05:59,032 --> 00:06:02,067
I have pain radiating
from my navel

135
00:06:02,068 --> 00:06:03,886
to my lower right abdomen.

136
00:06:03,887 --> 00:06:05,955
I'm nauseated
and feverish.

137
00:06:05,956 --> 00:06:08,874
I believe I may have cholera.

138
00:06:08,875 --> 00:06:11,176
There's no cholera
in Pasadena.

139
00:06:11,177 --> 00:06:12,228
Just like last summer,

140
00:06:12,229 --> 00:06:14,296
when there
was no malaria
in Pasadena.

141
00:06:14,297 --> 00:06:15,681
Well, if it's not cholera,

142
00:06:15,682 --> 00:06:18,583
then based on a quick
Internet search,

143
00:06:18,584 --> 00:06:21,420
the other explanations in
decreasing order of likelihood

144
00:06:21,421 --> 00:06:25,307
are Hirschsprung's Disease,
botulism, a 30-foot tapeworm

145
00:06:25,308 --> 00:06:29,228
or accidental ingestion
of chrysanthemum blossoms.

146
00:06:29,229 --> 00:06:33,032
When would you have accidentally
eaten chrysanthemum blossoms?

147
00:06:33,033 --> 00:06:34,617
It's part of an
unlikely scenario

148
00:06:34,618 --> 00:06:37,269
that involves sleepwalking
and a 24-hour flower mart

149
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:39,488
with a less-than-
vigilant proprietor.

150
00:06:39,489 --> 00:06:41,940
Oh, Lord, my belly!

151
00:06:41,941 --> 00:06:43,792
Ever had your
appendix out?

152
00:06:43,793 --> 00:06:45,044
I haven't.

153
00:06:45,045 --> 00:06:47,496
I've been meaning to,
but who has the time?

154
00:06:47,497 --> 00:06:50,065
Let's get you
to the hospital.

155
00:06:50,066 --> 00:06:54,286
So this is how it ends...

156
00:06:54,287 --> 00:06:56,422
with cruel irony.

157
00:06:56,423 --> 00:06:58,707
Just as I make the commitment
to preserving my body,

158
00:06:58,708 --> 00:07:02,261
I am betrayed by my appendix,
a vestigial organ.

159
00:07:02,262 --> 00:07:03,629
Do you know

160
00:07:03,630 --> 00:07:05,731
the original purpose
of the appendix, Leonard?

161
00:07:05,732 --> 00:07:06,832
No.

162
00:07:06,833 --> 00:07:09,018
I do. And yet I'm doomed

163
00:07:09,019 --> 00:07:10,686
while you live on.

164
00:07:12,638 --> 00:07:14,857
Funny how things
work out, isn't it?

165
00:07:14,858 --> 00:07:18,560
Oh, Lord, I think
it's about to burst!

166
00:07:21,548 --> 00:07:23,648
On the other hand,

167
00:07:23,649 --> 00:07:26,368
it might have been
the Brussels sprouts.

168
00:07:27,754 --> 00:07:29,922
Good night.

169
00:07:29,923 --> 00:07:31,173
Good night.

170
00:07:31,174 --> 00:07:32,824
Appendicitis.

171
00:07:32,825 --> 00:07:35,511
What a nervous Nelly.

172
00:07:38,798 --> 00:07:40,132
Penny! Penny!

173
00:07:40,133 --> 00:07:41,884
Penny!

174
00:07:41,885 --> 00:07:44,803
Coming, coming.

175
00:07:44,804 --> 00:07:46,722
Hey, nice knees.

176
00:07:46,723 --> 00:07:47,806
Thank you.

177
00:07:47,807 --> 00:07:48,840
They're my mother's.

178
00:07:48,841 --> 00:07:51,360
Oh.
And the Flash
shirt is what?

179
00:07:51,361 --> 00:07:53,362
Because, what,
you're gonna run really fast?

180
00:07:53,363 --> 00:07:56,115
No, the Flash shirt is
because it's Friday,

181
00:07:56,116 --> 00:07:58,567
but it's nice when
things work out.

182
00:07:58,568 --> 00:08:00,652
Where's your
heart rate monitor?
I don't have one.

183
00:08:00,653 --> 00:08:02,454
What about your pedometer?
Don't have one.

184
00:08:02,455 --> 00:08:04,990
Do you have telematics
in your shoes connected
to an iPod?

185
00:08:04,991 --> 00:08:06,909
Uh, no.
What do you do,

186
00:08:06,910 --> 00:08:10,329
you just go out there
and gambol about
like a bunny?

187
00:08:10,330 --> 00:08:14,967
No. I just run till I'm hungry,
then I stop for a bear claw.

188
00:08:18,388 --> 00:08:19,704
Why are you doing that?

189
00:08:19,705 --> 00:08:22,341
It's good to stretch your
muscles before you run.

190
00:08:22,342 --> 00:08:23,592
All right.
All right,

191
00:08:23,593 --> 00:08:24,810
let's start with a toe touch.

192
00:08:32,268 --> 00:08:34,853
Okay, you do it.

193
00:08:34,854 --> 00:08:36,822
I <i>am</i> doing it.

194
00:08:37,890 --> 00:08:39,525
Oh. Wow. Good job.

195
00:08:39,526 --> 00:08:40,743
Okay, um,

196
00:08:40,744 --> 00:08:42,444
can you do this?

197
00:08:44,164 --> 00:08:46,231
We'll never know.

198
00:08:46,232 --> 00:08:48,534
Okay, let's just warm up
on the run.

199
00:08:48,535 --> 00:08:50,119
Okay.
Okay, let's go.

200
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:52,204
I've been reading up
on biomechanics.

201
00:08:52,205 --> 00:08:54,022
I think you'll be
surprised at my...

202
00:08:56,393 --> 00:08:58,560
Oh, my God,
are you okay?

203
00:08:58,561 --> 00:08:59,695
I think so.

204
00:08:59,696 --> 00:09:02,030
Oh, let me
help you up.
Thank you.

205
00:09:04,367 --> 00:09:06,802
Oh, Sheldon!

206
00:09:06,803 --> 00:09:08,804
If it makes you
feel any better,

207
00:09:08,805 --> 00:09:12,307
Thursday is no longer
Cruciferous Vegetable Night.

208
00:09:13,526 --> 00:09:15,944
Here's my chicken curry.

209
00:09:15,945 --> 00:09:17,362
Howard, your
shrimp biryani.

210
00:09:17,363 --> 00:09:19,448
Thank you, sir.
Palak paneer,
that's Penny.

211
00:09:19,449 --> 00:09:22,201
Thanks.
And for Rajesh
Koothrappali,

212
00:09:22,202 --> 00:09:24,369
from whose homeland
these tasty dishes originate,

213
00:09:24,370 --> 00:09:26,771
one large order of
chicken McNuggets.

214
00:09:29,793 --> 00:09:32,127
Hey, what's my share?
Uh... 12 bucks.

215
00:09:32,128 --> 00:09:34,663
Okay, can I get you after Friday
when I get paid?
Sure.

216
00:09:34,664 --> 00:09:36,415
What am I up to now?

217
00:09:36,416 --> 00:09:38,750
Well, okay, with
the Indian food, the pizza,

218
00:09:38,751 --> 00:09:40,785
the Thai food, the tank of gas,

219
00:09:40,786 --> 00:09:42,454
the frozen yogurt

220
00:09:42,455 --> 00:09:44,756
and your rent, uh...

221
00:09:44,757 --> 00:09:47,626
a little over $1,400.

222
00:09:50,513 --> 00:09:51,847
What now?

223
00:09:51,848 --> 00:09:53,816
He's just expressing
his admiration that

224
00:09:53,817 --> 00:09:57,636
you don't even have to
put out to get free stuff.

225
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:03,525
It's not free-- I'm
gonna pay him back.

226
00:10:04,761 --> 00:10:07,696
Shut up!

227
00:10:07,697 --> 00:10:10,098
Sheldon, are you gonna join us?

228
00:10:10,099 --> 00:10:11,667
Coming!

229
00:10:26,049 --> 00:10:28,267
Greetings, friends.

230
00:10:28,268 --> 00:10:31,303
Greetings, whatever
the hell you are.

231
00:10:31,304 --> 00:10:34,740
I am a mobile
virtual presence device.

232
00:10:34,741 --> 00:10:36,325
Recent events

233
00:10:36,326 --> 00:10:39,761
have demonstrated to me
that my body is too fragile

234
00:10:39,762 --> 00:10:42,264
to endure the vicissitudes
of the world.

235
00:10:42,265 --> 00:10:44,733
Until such time as I am able

236
00:10:44,734 --> 00:10:46,168
to transfer my consciousness,

237
00:10:46,169 --> 00:10:49,004
I shall remain
in a secure location

238
00:10:49,005 --> 00:10:52,357
and interact with the world
in this manner.

239
00:10:53,159 --> 00:10:54,543
Really? That's
your question--

240
00:10:54,544 --> 00:10:57,079
when did he
put a ramp in?

241
00:11:03,353 --> 00:11:05,370
You're in my spot.

242
00:11:17,744 --> 00:11:20,996
This may seem a little odd
at first,

243
00:11:20,997 --> 00:11:23,649
but over time,
you'll grow accustomed

244
00:11:23,650 --> 00:11:26,902
to dealing with me
in this configuration.

245
00:11:26,903 --> 00:11:29,838
Yeah, to be honest, I
don't see much difference.

246
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:31,039
Thank you.

247
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:33,258
That's what I was going for.

248
00:11:34,544 --> 00:11:37,963
Now, Leonard, tomorrow,
when we go to work,

249
00:11:37,964 --> 00:11:39,915
you'll need to allow
some extra time

250
00:11:39,916 --> 00:11:41,733
to get me down the stairs.

251
00:11:41,734 --> 00:11:46,355
For your convenience,
I disassemble into four pieces.

252
00:11:46,356 --> 00:11:47,439
This is ridiculous.

253
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:48,607
I'm coming to talk to you.

254
00:11:48,608 --> 00:11:50,909
You don't know where I am.

255
00:11:52,311 --> 00:11:54,947
My physical body
is safely ensconced

256
00:11:54,948 --> 00:11:57,649
in a secure,
undisclosed location.

257
00:11:57,650 --> 00:11:59,251
You're in your bedroom.

258
00:11:59,252 --> 00:12:00,836
No, I'm not.

259
00:12:00,837 --> 00:12:04,172
I can hear your voice
coming from your bedroom.

260
00:12:05,375 --> 00:12:07,509
No, you can't.

261
00:12:09,596 --> 00:12:10,846
Wait.

262
00:12:10,847 --> 00:12:12,214
Come back.

263
00:12:12,215 --> 00:12:13,498
Halt.

264
00:12:13,499 --> 00:12:16,885
Authorized personnel only!

265
00:12:18,004 --> 00:12:19,371
So, either one
of you weirdos

266
00:12:19,372 --> 00:12:22,374
want to buy my underwear?
Only 1,400 bucks.

267
00:12:26,696 --> 00:12:28,864
Sheldon,
this is ridiculous.

268
00:12:28,865 --> 00:12:30,432
I'm behind you.

269
00:12:30,433 --> 00:12:33,652
Please look at me when
you're talking to me.

270
00:12:33,653 --> 00:12:35,153
I am looking at you.

271
00:12:35,154 --> 00:12:36,438
No, you're not.

272
00:12:36,439 --> 00:12:38,907
Pay no attention to
that man in the bed.

273
00:12:38,908 --> 00:12:40,208
You cannot exist

274
00:12:40,209 --> 00:12:41,960
as a virtual presence.

275
00:12:41,961 --> 00:12:43,829
Not here
and certainly not at work.

276
00:12:43,830 --> 00:12:45,697
Oh, good God.

277
00:12:45,698 --> 00:12:47,265
At my age,
do you know

278
00:12:47,266 --> 00:12:50,118
how I'm statistically
most likely to die?

279
00:12:50,119 --> 00:12:52,404
At the hands of your roommate?

280
00:12:52,405 --> 00:12:53,972
An accident.

281
00:12:53,973 --> 00:12:56,441
That's how I'm going
to make it look.

282
00:12:56,442 --> 00:12:59,077
Until I can transfer
my intellect

283
00:12:59,078 --> 00:13:00,379
to a more durable container,

284
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:03,148
my body will remain
safely ensconced in my bed.

285
00:13:03,149 --> 00:13:05,200
Fine, but don't expect my help.

286
00:13:05,201 --> 00:13:07,769
You have to help--
it's in the roommate agreement.

287
00:13:07,770 --> 00:13:09,287
No, it's not.

288
00:13:11,557 --> 00:13:13,592
Section 74.C.

289
00:13:13,593 --> 00:13:16,111
The various obligations
and duties of the parties

290
00:13:16,112 --> 00:13:19,748
in the event one of
them becomes a robot.

291
00:13:20,616 --> 00:13:23,435
I'll be damned.

292
00:13:33,796 --> 00:13:35,597
This is delightful.

293
00:13:35,598 --> 00:13:37,599
Uh-huh.

294
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,885
It's much easier to enjoy

295
00:13:39,886 --> 00:13:41,887
the picturesque route
we travel to work

296
00:13:41,888 --> 00:13:45,107
when you remove the specter
of fiery vehicular death.

297
00:13:45,108 --> 00:13:46,391
Refresh my memory.

298
00:13:46,392 --> 00:13:48,944
Why didn't I just put you
in the trunk?

299
00:13:48,945 --> 00:13:51,947
Because I called shotgun.
Remember?

300
00:13:51,948 --> 00:13:54,616
Right.

301
00:13:58,270 --> 00:14:00,956
You seem tense.

302
00:14:00,957 --> 00:14:03,658
Perhaps this will relax you.

303
00:14:12,952 --> 00:14:14,803
I don't want to listen
to music, Sheldon.

304
00:14:17,056 --> 00:14:18,423
Very well.

305
00:14:18,424 --> 00:14:22,310
I don't understand
why you're not enjoying this.

306
00:14:22,311 --> 00:14:26,848
Together, in this car,
with my enhanced capabilities,

307
00:14:26,849 --> 00:14:29,351
we're like <i>Knight Rider.</i>

308
00:14:29,352 --> 00:14:33,188
Except in <i>Knight Rider,</i> the car
isn't a yammering sphincter.

309
00:14:34,306 --> 00:14:36,141
You mock the sphincter,

310
00:14:36,142 --> 00:14:38,910
but the sphincter
is a class of muscle

311
00:14:38,911 --> 00:14:41,363
without which human beings
couldn't survive.

312
00:14:44,450 --> 00:14:46,701
There are over 50
different sphincters

313
00:14:46,702 --> 00:14:48,370
in the human body.

314
00:14:48,371 --> 00:14:50,756
How many can you name?

315
00:14:51,824 --> 00:14:54,659
I was wrong-- this is exactly
like <i>Knight Rider.</i>

316
00:14:55,795 --> 00:14:57,796
Perhaps you'd be interested
in a different game.

317
00:14:57,797 --> 00:14:59,264
No.

318
00:14:59,265 --> 00:15:00,849
This is a photograph of the 1911

319
00:15:00,850 --> 00:15:04,269
Solvay Conference on the theory
of radiation and quanta.

320
00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:08,774
Using Photoshop, I've
introduced a few anachronisms.

321
00:15:08,775 --> 00:15:11,143
See if you can spot all 24.

322
00:15:11,144 --> 00:15:12,644
I'll give you the first one.

323
00:15:12,645 --> 00:15:16,948
Madame Curie should not
be wearing a digital watch.

324
00:15:16,949 --> 00:15:18,316
And go.

325
00:15:20,736 --> 00:15:22,353
That's it. Bye-bye.

326
00:15:26,209 --> 00:15:27,325
Bazinga.
Whoa!

327
00:15:29,412 --> 00:15:31,713
I have an override switch.

328
00:15:31,714 --> 00:15:33,331
I almost died!

329
00:15:33,332 --> 00:15:35,834
And I'm safe and sound in bed.

330
00:15:35,835 --> 00:15:38,003
Who's crazy now?

331
00:15:38,004 --> 00:15:40,705
I'm still going
to go with you.

332
00:15:46,562 --> 00:15:48,713
Hello, Professor Hoskins.

333
00:15:48,714 --> 00:15:51,433
Nice to see you, Mindy.

334
00:15:51,434 --> 00:15:54,236
And <i>konnichiwa, Dr. Nakamora.</i>

335
00:15:54,237 --> 00:15:57,889
Sorry the Swedes
disproved your theory.

336
00:16:04,914 --> 00:16:06,915
Leonard, my door.

337
00:16:06,916 --> 00:16:08,150
What about it?

338
00:16:08,151 --> 00:16:10,969
Be a lamb and open it for me.

339
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:12,921
Why? What's the problem?

340
00:16:18,811 --> 00:16:21,746
You think you have me stymied,
don't you?

341
00:16:21,747 --> 00:16:25,217
No, I think a doorknob
has you stymied.

342
00:16:26,719 --> 00:16:29,771
Oh, look, it's Leonard
and R2-D-Bag.

343
00:16:31,557 --> 00:16:33,275
That's my joke.
I told it last night.

344
00:16:33,276 --> 00:16:35,560
You can't just use it.

345
00:16:35,561 --> 00:16:38,947
Raj, be a lamb
and open the door for me.

346
00:16:38,948 --> 00:16:41,533
Oh, sure.

347
00:16:43,786 --> 00:16:45,320
He's a lamb.

348
00:16:45,321 --> 00:16:47,122
You're not.

349
00:16:49,542 --> 00:16:51,743
I'm a lamb.

350
00:16:53,946 --> 00:16:55,847
Isn't this nice?

351
00:16:55,848 --> 00:16:59,084
The pleasures of fellowship
and camaraderie

352
00:16:59,085 --> 00:17:03,255
without having to tolerate
your germy breath on my skin.

353
00:17:03,256 --> 00:17:05,340
I say we just take him
to Tatooine

354
00:17:05,341 --> 00:17:07,309
and sell him to some Jawas.

355
00:17:07,310 --> 00:17:08,977
That's two, dude.

356
00:17:08,978 --> 00:17:10,729
Write your own jokes.

357
00:17:11,931 --> 00:17:13,848
Oh, great.

358
00:17:15,634 --> 00:17:17,519
Hi, I'm Penny,
I'll be your waitress.

359
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:19,154
Why are you introducing
yourself?

360
00:17:19,155 --> 00:17:20,322
I'd rather people not know

361
00:17:20,323 --> 00:17:22,857
I have any prior connection
to you whatsoever.

362
00:17:23,743 --> 00:17:26,027
Can you tell me
the specials this evening?

363
00:17:26,028 --> 00:17:27,529
Sheldon, I'm not waiting on you.

364
00:17:27,530 --> 00:17:28,513
Obviously.

365
00:17:28,514 --> 00:17:30,732
I don't even have
water yet.

366
00:17:30,733 --> 00:17:32,284
Because you're not here.

367
00:17:32,285 --> 00:17:35,754
That's discrimination
against the otherwise located.

368
00:17:36,822 --> 00:17:38,673
I'm going to have
to go over your head.

369
00:17:40,843 --> 00:17:44,496
Manager... manager.

370
00:17:44,497 --> 00:17:48,216
Oh, Lord,
look who it is.

371
00:17:49,051 --> 00:17:51,386
Is that Steve Wozniak?

372
00:17:51,387 --> 00:17:52,270
I think it is.

373
00:17:52,271 --> 00:17:55,040
The Great and Powerful Woz.

374
00:17:55,858 --> 00:17:56,891
Penny,
Steve Wozniak was

375
00:17:56,892 --> 00:17:57,859
one of the cofounders

376
00:17:57,860 --> 00:17:59,060
of Apple Computer.

377
00:17:59,061 --> 00:18:00,478
He and Steve Jobs started it...
Yeah,

378
00:18:00,479 --> 00:18:02,647
I know who he is.
I watch <i>Dancing with the Stars.</i>

379
00:18:03,699 --> 00:18:05,700
I must speak to him.

380
00:18:05,701 --> 00:18:07,118
Of course you must.

381
00:18:09,622 --> 00:18:11,823
You know, there's an
Olive Garden down the street.

382
00:18:11,824 --> 00:18:14,376
You guys should try it sometime.

383
00:18:14,377 --> 00:18:17,362
Excuse me,
Mr. Wozniak?

384
00:18:17,363 --> 00:18:18,530
Oh, hey.

385
00:18:18,531 --> 00:18:20,432
Nice virtual presence device.

386
00:18:20,433 --> 00:18:21,416
Thank you.

387
00:18:21,417 --> 00:18:23,969
I just want to say
I'm a big fan.

388
00:18:23,970 --> 00:18:27,906
You're my 15th favorite
technological visionary.

389
00:18:27,907 --> 00:18:29,557
Only 15th?

390
00:18:29,558 --> 00:18:33,161
It's still six spots
above Steve Jobs.

391
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:35,513
I care neither for turtlenecks

392
00:18:35,514 --> 00:18:37,382
nor showmanship.

393
00:18:37,383 --> 00:18:40,752
Yeah, I never got
that turtleneck thing.

394
00:18:40,753 --> 00:18:44,689
One of my proudest possessions
is a vintage 1977 Apple Two.

395
00:18:44,690 --> 00:18:49,210
Despite the file system
limitations of Apple DOS 3.3,

396
00:18:49,211 --> 00:18:51,513
it was a pretty nifty
little achievement.

397
00:18:51,514 --> 00:18:53,798
Thanks, we were shooting
for "nifty."

398
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:55,650
You know, if you had it here,

399
00:18:55,651 --> 00:18:57,252
I'd autograph it for you.

400
00:18:58,104 --> 00:19:00,488
Don't move
for 15 to 30 minutes,

401
00:19:00,489 --> 00:19:03,191
depending on how
the buses are running.

402
00:19:04,994 --> 00:19:07,462
Nerds.

403
00:19:10,549 --> 00:19:12,867
I'm coming, Woz, I'm coming.

404
00:19:12,868 --> 00:19:13,835
Ow!

405
00:19:13,836 --> 00:19:15,186
Oh!

406
00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:20,392
Aw.

407
00:19:34,501 --> 00:19:39,471
Penny... Penny... Penny.

408
00:19:41,357 --> 00:19:43,475
What up, Shel-Bot?

409
00:19:43,476 --> 00:19:45,344
I can't get out of bed.

410
00:19:45,345 --> 00:19:46,729
I hurt my ankle.

411
00:19:46,730 --> 00:19:48,313
What do you want me to do?

412
00:19:48,314 --> 00:19:50,649
Sing me "Soft Kitty."

413
00:19:50,650 --> 00:19:53,352
Really, you want me
to sing "Soft Kitty"

414
00:19:53,353 --> 00:19:54,987
to a computer monitor?

415
00:19:54,988 --> 00:19:57,823
Would you rather come over
and sing it to me in person?

416
00:19:57,824 --> 00:20:01,110
? Soft kitty, warm kitty ?

417
00:20:01,111 --> 00:20:02,995
? Little ball of fur... ?

418
00:20:02,996 --> 00:20:05,614
Closer to the microphone.

419
00:20:05,615 --> 00:20:08,917
? Happy kitty,
sleepy... ?

420
00:20:08,918 --> 00:20:11,186
No.

421
00:20:11,187 --> 00:20:14,456
You have to start over.

422
00:20:14,457 --> 00:20:17,793
? Soft kitty,
warm kitty ?

423
00:20:17,794 --> 00:20:20,929
? Little ball of fur ?

424
00:20:20,930 --> 00:20:23,732
? Happy kitty,
sleepy kitty ?

425
00:20:23,733 --> 00:20:25,084
? Purr, purr, purr. ?
