2
00:00:12,434 --> 00:00:14,231
Clarify something for me.

3
00:00:14,402 --> 00:00:19,601
Isn't the point of a communal meal
the exchange of ideas and opinions...

4
00:00:19,774 --> 00:00:22,743
...an opportunity to consider
important issues of the day?

5
00:00:22,911 --> 00:00:25,937
It is. You just kind of put a damper
on things when you said:

6
00:00:26,114 --> 00:00:30,141
"The next person I see talking with
food in their mouth will be put to death."

7
00:00:30,919 --> 00:00:33,149
We could argue about
who said what all night...

8
00:00:33,321 --> 00:00:35,915
...but to set things back on course...

9
00:00:36,091 --> 00:00:38,616
...I will propose a new topic
of conversation.

10
00:00:38,793 --> 00:00:39,851
- Oh!
- Great.

11
00:00:40,028 --> 00:00:42,758
What is the best number?

12
00:00:42,931 --> 00:00:46,423
By the way,
there's only one correct answer.

13
00:00:47,802 --> 00:00:50,771
Five million, three hundred,
eighteen thousand and eight?

14
00:00:50,939 --> 00:00:55,399
Wrong. The best number is 73.

15
00:00:58,813 --> 00:01:00,007
You're probably wondering why.

16
00:01:00,181 --> 00:01:01,273
- No.
- No, we're good.

17
00:01:01,449 --> 00:01:03,610
Seventy three
is the 21st prime number.

18
00:01:03,785 --> 00:01:05,810
It's mirror, 37, is the 12th...

19
00:01:05,987 --> 00:01:10,481
...and its mirror, 21, is the product
of multiplying... Hang on to your hats.

20
00:01:10,659 --> 00:01:12,684
- Seven and three.

21
00:01:13,728 --> 00:01:16,925
Heh? Heh? Did I lie?

22
00:01:17,098 --> 00:01:20,761
We get it.
73 is the Chuck Norris of numbers.

23
00:01:21,503 --> 00:01:23,869
Chuck Norris wishes.

24
00:01:24,072 --> 00:01:26,302
In binary, 73 is a palindrome:

25
00:01:26,474 --> 00:01:27,702
One, zero, zero, one...

26
00:01:27,876 --> 00:01:29,036
...zero, zero, one.

27
00:01:29,210 --> 00:01:32,441
Which, backwards,
is one, zero, zero, one, zero, zero, one.

28
00:01:32,614 --> 00:01:33,774
Exactly the same.

29
00:01:33,948 --> 00:01:38,112
All Chuck Norris backwards
gets you is "sirron kcuhc."

30
00:01:38,987 --> 00:01:43,856
Just for the record, when you enter
5,318,008 in a calculator...

31
00:01:44,025 --> 00:01:46,459
...upside down, it spells "boobies."

32
00:01:50,398 --> 00:01:53,196
Remember wondering why
the girls didn't wanna eat with us?

33
00:01:53,368 --> 00:01:54,995
Yeah, I get it now.

34
00:01:57,172 --> 00:02:01,165
- I love your heart locket, Bernadette.
- Oh, thanks. Howard gave it to me.

35
00:02:01,342 --> 00:02:02,366
It's the cutest thing.

36
00:02:02,544 --> 00:02:06,310
Every time I have dinner with his mom,
the next day I get jewelry.

37
00:02:07,916 --> 00:02:11,682
Did you know the Valentine's heart
is not based on the shape of a heart...

38
00:02:11,853 --> 00:02:15,152
...but rather on the shape of
the buttocks of a female bending over?

39
00:02:18,193 --> 00:02:22,493
Oh. So I spent seventh grade
dotting my I's with little asses?

40
00:02:23,631 --> 00:02:24,825
Cool.

41
00:02:26,334 --> 00:02:29,201
- Hey, Penny, how's it going?
- Zack. What are you doing here?

42
00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:31,668
My dad's company prints menus
for this place.

43
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,603
Dropping off some new ones,
laminated.

44
00:02:33,775 --> 00:02:36,005
Easier to clean
if people throw up on them.

45
00:02:37,545 --> 00:02:40,343
- Guess how I got the idea.
- Yeah, I got it. I got it.

46
00:02:40,815 --> 00:02:43,943
Ahem. Uh, Zack, these are my friends
Bernadette and Amy.

47
00:02:44,152 --> 00:02:45,210
- Hi.
- Hey.

48
00:02:45,386 --> 00:02:47,581
Hoo.

49
00:02:49,924 --> 00:02:53,257
- Okay, well, it was good to see you.
- Yeah, you too.

50
00:02:53,428 --> 00:02:56,727
- He's really cute. How do you know him?
- Oh, we went out a couple times.

51
00:02:56,898 --> 00:02:58,695
I'm often flummoxed by current slang.

52
00:02:58,867 --> 00:03:01,461
Does "went out" mean
"had intercourse"?

53
00:03:02,036 --> 00:03:03,663
- Yes.
- No. No.

54
00:03:04,405 --> 00:03:06,168
But in this case, yes.

55
00:03:06,775 --> 00:03:09,869
- Interesting. And was it not satisfactory?
- No, it was great.

56
00:03:10,044 --> 00:03:13,411
He just didn't really challenge me
on an intellectual level.

57
00:03:13,581 --> 00:03:17,073
Couldn't you just fool around with him
and then listen to NPR?

58
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:21,487
Wouldn't help.
Zack can't even spell NPR.

59
00:03:22,223 --> 00:03:23,554
It's what I do with Howard.

60
00:03:23,725 --> 00:03:25,158
I'm much smarter than he is...

61
00:03:25,326 --> 00:03:27,726
...but it's important
to protect his manhood.

62
00:03:30,098 --> 00:03:31,622
Hoo.

63
00:03:33,001 --> 00:03:35,731
- What's the matter?
- I'm suddenly feeling flushed.

64
00:03:35,904 --> 00:03:40,238
My heart rate is elevated,
my palms are clammy, my mouth is dry.

65
00:03:40,408 --> 00:03:43,900
In addition,
I keep involuntarily saying "hoo."

66
00:03:45,013 --> 00:03:47,607
Oh, we know what's causing that,
don't we?

67
00:03:47,782 --> 00:03:48,840
It's no mystery.

68
00:03:49,017 --> 00:03:53,078
I obviously have the flu, coupled with
sudden-onset Tourette's syndrome.

69
00:04:21,783 --> 00:04:23,808
You hear about the accident
at the bio lab?

70
00:04:23,985 --> 00:04:25,213
- No.
- What happened?

71
00:04:25,386 --> 00:04:29,880
They were injecting rats with radioactive
isotopes and one of the techs got bit.

72
00:04:30,058 --> 00:04:32,253
Did he get super powers?

73
00:04:34,329 --> 00:04:37,924
No, he got five stitches
and a tetanus shot.

74
00:04:38,099 --> 00:04:39,123
Oh.

75
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:41,165
Well, that's disappointing.

76
00:04:41,336 --> 00:04:42,496
- Why?
- Oh.

77
00:04:42,670 --> 00:04:44,831
You get bit by radioactive animal
in a lab...

78
00:04:45,006 --> 00:04:47,065
...you kind of wanna
turn into a superhero.

79
00:04:47,775 --> 00:04:50,266
Yeah, but who'd wanna become
Rat Man?

80
00:04:51,145 --> 00:04:52,578
Who wouldn't?

81
00:04:54,015 --> 00:04:56,381
You could zip through a maze
in nothing flat...

82
00:04:56,551 --> 00:05:00,681
...squeeze through small holes and
shut down restaurants in a single bound.

83
00:05:00,855 --> 00:05:02,846
And the best part is,
if I were Rat Man...

84
00:05:03,024 --> 00:05:05,288
...you could be my sidekick,
Mouse Boy.

85
00:05:10,832 --> 00:05:12,163
Mouse Boy?

86
00:05:12,333 --> 00:05:15,825
You don't like Mouse Boy?
How about, uh, Kid Vermin?

87
00:05:16,004 --> 00:05:19,167
First of all, if we had super powers,
I wouldn't be the sidekick.

88
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:23,242
- You'd be the sidekick.
- Rat Man is nobody's sidekick.

89
00:05:23,811 --> 00:05:27,212
Leonard, settle this, of the two of us,
who's the obvious sidekick?

90
00:05:27,382 --> 00:05:28,406
Yeah, Leonard, who?

91
00:05:31,886 --> 00:05:34,946
Twelve years after high school
and I'm still at the nerd table.

92
00:05:39,327 --> 00:05:43,195
Aren't you slicing that man's brain
a little too thin?

93
00:05:47,568 --> 00:05:51,129
It's too thin if I were making a foot-long
brain sandwich at Quizno's.

94
00:05:52,607 --> 00:05:54,905
For examination
under a two photon microscope...

95
00:05:55,076 --> 00:05:57,237
...it's fine.

96
00:06:00,415 --> 00:06:01,882
Well, you're the expert.

97
00:06:02,050 --> 00:06:05,884
If the correct way to do it
is the wrong way, then I yield.

98
00:06:06,054 --> 00:06:08,784
Very well, if you die and donate
your body to science...

99
00:06:08,957 --> 00:06:11,391
...I promise to slice your brain
like Canadian bacon.

100
00:06:12,727 --> 00:06:14,422
Thank you.

101
00:06:14,595 --> 00:06:17,860
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have to take my temperature.

102
00:06:18,066 --> 00:06:20,159
Are you monitoring
your circadian rhythms...

103
00:06:20,368 --> 00:06:23,565
...in order to identify your periods
of maximum mental acuity?

104
00:06:23,738 --> 00:06:24,830
I did that one summer.

105
00:06:25,006 --> 00:06:27,236
Ah, youth.

106
00:06:28,142 --> 00:06:30,633
No, I experienced distressing symptoms
last night...

107
00:06:30,812 --> 00:06:32,973
...so I'm checking
my vital signs every hour.

108
00:06:33,648 --> 00:06:37,812
I'd be happy to create a chart and
participate in a differential diagnosis.

109
00:06:37,986 --> 00:06:39,647
Oh, that sounds like fun.

110
00:06:41,956 --> 00:06:44,322
All right. Ahem.

111
00:06:44,525 --> 00:06:46,083
What were the symptoms?

112
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:49,855
Elevated heart rate, moist palms,
dry mouth...

113
00:06:50,031 --> 00:06:52,898
...and localized vascular throbbing.

114
00:06:54,202 --> 00:06:57,103
Localized to what region?

115
00:06:58,539 --> 00:07:01,269
Ears and genitalia.

116
00:07:02,276 --> 00:07:03,300
Interesting.

117
00:07:03,478 --> 00:07:06,038
Not body parts that usually team up.

118
00:07:09,350 --> 00:07:13,184
What about environmental factors?
Describe the scene for me.

119
00:07:13,354 --> 00:07:16,050
I was in a restaurant with Penny
and Bernadette, drinking water.

120
00:07:16,224 --> 00:07:19,125
Carbonated, as it was
a special occasion.

121
00:07:19,293 --> 00:07:23,730
Penny's friend Zack stopped by
and said hello and I said "hoo."

122
00:07:24,365 --> 00:07:26,299
- Who?
- Zack.

123
00:07:27,001 --> 00:07:30,061
- Then why did you ask?
- Ask what?

124
00:07:30,238 --> 00:07:32,433
- "Who?"
- Zack.

125
00:07:33,541 --> 00:07:35,509
All right, let's start over.

126
00:07:35,676 --> 00:07:37,769
What did you say
when Zack walked in?

127
00:07:37,945 --> 00:07:40,413
- Hoo.
- Zack.

128
00:07:40,581 --> 00:07:43,812
- Why do you keep saying Zack?
- Because you keep saying, "Who?"

129
00:07:43,985 --> 00:07:46,545
I'm not saying "hoo" now,
I said "hoo" last night.

130
00:07:46,721 --> 00:07:48,848
And the answer was Zack, correct?

131
00:07:49,557 --> 00:07:52,321
There was no question,
I simply said, "Hoo."

132
00:07:54,595 --> 00:07:56,859
All right.
I think I have enough to go on.

133
00:07:58,599 --> 00:08:00,999
Possible explanations
for your symptoms are...

134
00:08:01,169 --> 00:08:03,034
...in descending order of likelihood...

135
00:08:03,204 --> 00:08:04,501
...hyperthyroidism...

136
00:08:04,672 --> 00:08:06,003
...premature menopause...

137
00:08:06,174 --> 00:08:08,506
...hosting an alien parasite...

138
00:08:08,676 --> 00:08:13,045
...or, and I only include it for the sake of
covering absolutely all bases...

139
00:08:13,214 --> 00:08:15,478
...sexual arousal.

140
00:08:17,685 --> 00:08:20,711
Where would I have picked up
an alien parasite?

141
00:08:23,591 --> 00:08:25,354
- There you are.
- Oh, hey.

142
00:08:25,526 --> 00:08:28,427
Let me ask you a question.
What are you most afraid of?

143
00:08:29,130 --> 00:08:30,222
I don't know. Uh...

144
00:08:30,398 --> 00:08:34,095
Nuclear war, being buried alive.
Any of those movies where you get...

145
00:08:34,268 --> 00:08:38,204
...that phone call that says
you're going to die, and then you do.

146
00:08:38,372 --> 00:08:41,068
No, something very specific
that we both know you...

147
00:08:41,242 --> 00:08:44,143
...Rajesh Koothrappalli,
are terrified of.

148
00:08:44,812 --> 00:08:47,110
Well, type two diabetes
runs in my family.

149
00:08:47,281 --> 00:08:51,149
- The thought of losing a toe...
- Spiders. You're afraid of spiders.

150
00:08:51,919 --> 00:08:55,082
- What the heck is this?
- A jar with a big spider in it, of course.

151
00:08:56,290 --> 00:09:00,420
Bravery test. First one to take
his hand out is the sidekick.

152
00:09:00,595 --> 00:09:01,960
Wha...?

153
00:09:02,763 --> 00:09:05,561
- Are you crazy?
- Perhaps.

154
00:09:07,268 --> 00:09:09,793
- Are you scared?
- No. But it's a stupid test.

155
00:09:09,971 --> 00:09:11,063
Oh, really?

156
00:09:11,239 --> 00:09:14,231
What if the Earth was in danger
and the only way to save it...

157
00:09:14,408 --> 00:09:17,502
...was to stick your hand in a jar
with a spider?

158
00:09:17,678 --> 00:09:21,114
Yeah? What if only way to save it
was to shower in the locker room...

159
00:09:21,282 --> 00:09:23,045
...and let other guys see you naked?

160
00:09:25,119 --> 00:09:27,587
Oh, come on.
That's never gonna happen.

161
00:09:28,656 --> 00:09:32,683
Now, put your hand in the jar
or forever be revealed as my sidekick.

162
00:09:33,828 --> 00:09:36,422
All right, I will.

163
00:09:37,598 --> 00:09:39,759
How did you get so brave
all of a sudden?

164
00:09:39,934 --> 00:09:42,368
It's easy.
The spider's crawling up your arm.

165
00:09:48,509 --> 00:09:50,443
Get it off me, get it off me.

166
00:09:50,611 --> 00:09:52,374
Please, Raj!

167
00:09:54,682 --> 00:09:56,513
Please!

168
00:10:01,155 --> 00:10:03,214
My blood work shows
thyroid function normal.

169
00:10:03,391 --> 00:10:04,619
Cortisol levels normal.

170
00:10:05,693 --> 00:10:08,457
How about your
follicle-stimulating hormone levels?

171
00:10:08,629 --> 00:10:11,154
Sheldon, I am not going
through menopause.

172
00:10:11,832 --> 00:10:16,735
Are you sure? You said that
with the testy bark of an old biddy.

173
00:10:17,972 --> 00:10:20,372
I think we need to face
the cold, hard truth.

174
00:10:20,541 --> 00:10:23,806
I was sexually aroused
by Penny's friend Zack.

175
00:10:23,978 --> 00:10:25,002
Hang on.

176
00:10:25,179 --> 00:10:29,809
I don't know that we've given the
alien parasite hypothesis a fair shake.

177
00:10:29,984 --> 00:10:33,010
Let's look at this logically.
I have a stomach, I get hungry.

178
00:10:33,187 --> 00:10:35,917
I have genitals, I have the potential
for sexual arousal.

179
00:10:37,024 --> 00:10:38,753
A cross we all must bear.

180
00:10:41,195 --> 00:10:44,323
You know,
in difficult moments like this...

181
00:10:44,498 --> 00:10:47,262
...I often turn to a force greater
than myself.

182
00:10:47,435 --> 00:10:49,130
- Religion?
- Star Trek.

183
00:10:50,571 --> 00:10:52,698
Did you see
The Motion Picture?

184
00:10:52,873 --> 00:10:54,204
- No.
- Don't. It's terrible.

185
00:10:54,375 --> 00:10:57,344
However, in it we learn that...

186
00:10:57,511 --> 00:11:00,275
...when Spock finds himself
drawn off the path of logic...

187
00:11:00,448 --> 00:11:02,939
...by feelings bubbling up
from his human half...

188
00:11:03,150 --> 00:11:07,018
...he suppresses them, using the
Vulcan mental discipline of Kolinahr.

189
00:11:07,221 --> 00:11:10,213
You suggesting we live our lives
guided by philosophies...

190
00:11:10,391 --> 00:11:14,384
...found in cheap science fiction?
- Cheap science fiction?

191
00:11:19,233 --> 00:11:20,257
What are you doing?

192
00:11:20,434 --> 00:11:26,031
Using Kolinahr to suppress my anger
at that last comment.

193
00:11:26,907 --> 00:11:28,966
Is it possible
that your concern for me...

194
00:11:29,176 --> 00:11:31,701
...is motivated by nothing more
than simple jealousy?

195
00:11:33,547 --> 00:11:37,779
I hadn't considered that.
Give me a moment.

196
00:11:40,187 --> 00:11:42,280
- All right. I've considered it.
- And?

197
00:11:42,456 --> 00:11:43,946
I reject it.

198
00:11:44,625 --> 00:11:46,923
You reject it
because you don't feel jealousy...

199
00:11:47,094 --> 00:11:49,961
...or because you are
suppressing jealousy?

200
00:11:50,931 --> 00:11:52,956
I think I'll eat my lunch at home.

201
00:11:55,403 --> 00:11:59,499
That's not your lunch, Sheldon.
Those are the cadaver brain specimens.

202
00:12:00,207 --> 00:12:01,299
Oh.

203
00:12:02,276 --> 00:12:03,937
As they were incorrectly sliced...

204
00:12:04,111 --> 00:12:07,740
...you can see how I could
mistake them for my sashimi.

205
00:12:15,456 --> 00:12:17,390
- Hello.
- Hey.

206
00:12:17,558 --> 00:12:19,822
Isn't tomorrow
your usual laundry night?

207
00:12:19,994 --> 00:12:22,986
The supermarket was out of
my regular fabric softener.

208
00:12:23,164 --> 00:12:28,466
If this one under or over-softens,
I'll need time to make things right.

209
00:12:28,669 --> 00:12:30,227
That's thinking ahead.

210
00:12:30,404 --> 00:12:33,271
The alternative would be
to think backwards...

211
00:12:33,474 --> 00:12:34,964
...and that's just remembering.

212
00:12:37,078 --> 00:12:40,411
- So how's Amy?
- Amy's changed.

213
00:12:40,581 --> 00:12:42,981
I might have to let her go.

214
00:12:43,184 --> 00:12:44,674
Oh, no. Why?

215
00:12:44,852 --> 00:12:49,585
I thought she was a highly evolved
creature of pure intellect, like me...

216
00:12:49,757 --> 00:12:53,693
...but recent events indicate that
she may be a slave to her baser urges.

217
00:12:53,894 --> 00:12:55,555
Like you.

218
00:12:57,398 --> 00:12:59,559
I'm just gonna skip over that insult.

219
00:13:00,501 --> 00:13:02,128
What insult?

220
00:13:02,303 --> 00:13:04,931
Yeah, that's why
I'm gonna skip over it.

221
00:13:05,439 --> 00:13:07,134
Are you saying that Amy is...

222
00:13:07,308 --> 00:13:09,299
...what's the scientific word...?

223
00:13:09,510 --> 00:13:12,604
Forget science. She's horny.

224
00:13:15,082 --> 00:13:16,879
Oh, okay. Wow!

225
00:13:17,051 --> 00:13:19,952
It's simple biology.
There's nothing I can do about it.

226
00:13:24,892 --> 00:13:26,291
Are you sure?

227
00:13:27,828 --> 00:13:29,022
What are you suggesting?

228
00:13:29,797 --> 00:13:32,994
I'm suggesting there might be
something you could do...

229
00:13:33,167 --> 00:13:35,829
...about Amy's urges.

230
00:13:39,807 --> 00:13:42,605
It's illegal to spay a human being.

231
00:13:45,446 --> 00:13:47,607
Yeah, that's not what I had in mind.

232
00:13:47,782 --> 00:13:49,044
Oh.

233
00:13:49,216 --> 00:13:50,706
Oh!

234
00:13:51,986 --> 00:13:56,355
- You mean something I could do.
- Exactly.

235
00:13:56,557 --> 00:13:59,754
Well, I was hoping to avoid this.

236
00:14:00,494 --> 00:14:03,190
But I might as well get it over with.

237
00:14:03,864 --> 00:14:05,422
Thank you, Penny.

238
00:14:05,599 --> 00:14:07,863
I'll let you know what happens.

239
00:14:10,638 --> 00:14:14,074
Oh, Amy, you lucky girl.

240
00:14:16,110 --> 00:14:18,510
Yes, this is Dr. Sheldon Cooper.

241
00:14:18,679 --> 00:14:23,776
Is this the Zack Johnson who used to
have coitus with my neighbor Penny?

242
00:14:25,319 --> 00:14:26,377
Sorry to bother you.

243
00:14:33,294 --> 00:14:36,024
Hello. I'm looking for a Zack Johnson...

244
00:14:36,197 --> 00:14:39,530
...who used to have coitus
with my neighbor Penny.

245
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:41,993
Coitus. It means intercourse.

246
00:14:42,169 --> 00:14:45,229
And I have a feeling
I'm speaking to the right Zack.

247
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:47,831
This is Sheldon Cooper.

248
00:14:48,008 --> 00:14:49,942
Fine, Shelly.

249
00:14:50,110 --> 00:14:52,908
Yes, that does sound like a girl's name.

250
00:14:53,113 --> 00:14:55,377
No, it doesn't bother me.

251
00:14:55,549 --> 00:14:59,417
Yes, Smelly Shelly does bother me.
Let me tell you why I'm calling.

252
00:14:59,620 --> 00:15:05,058
I'd like to know if you'd be interested
in having sex with Amy Farrah Fowler.

253
00:15:05,226 --> 00:15:07,524
Amy Farrah Fowler.

254
00:15:07,695 --> 00:15:10,220
Yes, that is a girl's name.

255
00:15:10,397 --> 00:15:13,560
Good grief,
it's like trying to talk to a dolphin.

256
00:15:15,436 --> 00:15:16,733
Really?

257
00:15:16,904 --> 00:15:21,136
This is gonna decide
who's the hero and who's the sidekick?

258
00:15:29,383 --> 00:15:33,911
- You got a better idea?
- Every idea is better than this idea.

259
00:15:35,022 --> 00:15:36,046
Ding!

260
00:15:36,223 --> 00:15:38,953
- Wait, what the hell is "ding"?
- It's a bell.

261
00:15:39,159 --> 00:15:42,390
- I don't think this wrestling has a bell.
- How do you wanna start?

262
00:15:42,563 --> 00:15:44,531
I say, how about one, two, three, go?

263
00:15:44,698 --> 00:15:47,030
One, two, three, go?
That's for babies.

264
00:15:47,668 --> 00:15:50,637
Okay. How about
"On your mark, get set, go."

265
00:15:50,804 --> 00:15:53,238
That's for a foot race.
We'd have to go outside.

266
00:15:53,407 --> 00:15:55,807
No, it's chilly outside.
I didn't bring my jacket.

267
00:15:57,678 --> 00:16:01,136
Oh, for crying out loud.
What kind of superhero needs a jacket?

268
00:16:01,315 --> 00:16:02,646
What kind of superhero says:

269
00:16:02,816 --> 00:16:05,182
"Dibs on the red tights,
dibs on the red tights"?

270
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:08,151
How about this?
Ready? Wrestle.

271
00:16:08,322 --> 00:16:09,380
Are we starting now...

272
00:16:09,557 --> 00:16:11,752
...or you're gonna say...?
- We're starting.

273
00:16:11,926 --> 00:16:14,190
Don't yell at me.

274
00:16:21,302 --> 00:16:24,965
I suppose there are worse ways
to spend a Friday night.

275
00:16:26,774 --> 00:16:28,503
None come to mind.

276
00:16:32,947 --> 00:16:34,437
Look at this stamp.

277
00:16:34,615 --> 00:16:39,643
On what authority are they permitted
to mutilate patrons as they enter?

278
00:16:40,354 --> 00:16:41,753
I'm sure it will wash off.

279
00:16:41,922 --> 00:16:45,255
Little comfort tonight.
I look like a Hell's Angel.

280
00:16:47,227 --> 00:16:48,854
There's Zack.

281
00:16:49,530 --> 00:16:51,589
Are you sure
this is what you want to do?

282
00:16:51,765 --> 00:16:56,225
It's not what I want to do,
it's what I have to do.

283
00:16:56,770 --> 00:16:59,102
Well, go, Amy Farrah Fowler.

284
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:01,733
Follow your endocrine system.

285
00:17:02,543 --> 00:17:05,535
- Thank you. You're a good friend.
- Please don't drag this out.

286
00:17:10,451 --> 00:17:13,284
This is never going to come off.

287
00:17:13,454 --> 00:17:15,388
Excuse me.

288
00:17:16,523 --> 00:17:19,458
Zack, I am Amy Farrah Fowler.
We met the other night.

289
00:17:19,627 --> 00:17:22,152
I have spent my life
in pursuit of pure knowledge.

290
00:17:22,329 --> 00:17:25,355
Until I met you, my decisions
were founded in logic and reason.

291
00:17:25,532 --> 00:17:28,831
And yet here I stand before you,
130 pounds of raging estrogen...

292
00:17:29,003 --> 00:17:31,369
...longing to grab hold of your
gluteus maximus...

293
00:17:31,538 --> 00:17:35,474
...and make Shakespeare's
metaphorical beast with two backs.

294
00:17:37,311 --> 00:17:39,404
My gluteus what?

295
00:17:40,814 --> 00:17:44,545
On the other hand, as I look at the blank,
ape-like expression on your face...

296
00:17:44,718 --> 00:17:48,085
...I have decided to adopt
the Vulcan practice of Kolinahr.

297
00:17:48,689 --> 00:17:50,987
- Goodbye, Zack.
- Bye.

298
00:17:51,358 --> 00:17:53,622
Oh, hoo!

299
00:17:57,297 --> 00:17:59,731
That should hold me for a while.

300
00:18:09,443 --> 00:18:14,847
I'm legally obligated to inform you
that I took a karate lesson when I was 11.

301
00:18:15,382 --> 00:18:16,906
I'd be a regular ninja by now...

302
00:18:17,084 --> 00:18:19,575
...if my mom
could have arranged a carpool.

303
00:18:19,753 --> 00:18:22,586
Well, I've been taking
a Pilates class at the rec center.

304
00:18:22,756 --> 00:18:24,917
My abs look like sections
of a Hershey bar.

305
00:18:26,226 --> 00:18:28,251
Oh, yeah? Won't matter,
you're going down.

306
00:18:28,429 --> 00:18:30,056
No, you're going down.

307
00:18:30,230 --> 00:18:32,027
If anybody's gonna go down,
it's you.

308
00:18:32,566 --> 00:18:36,593
Fellas, it's been 30 minutes
and nobody's touched each other.

309
00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:42,031
I'm glad you decided to reject
your animal hindbrain...

310
00:18:42,209 --> 00:18:44,404
...and return
to the realm of pure intellect.

311
00:18:44,578 --> 00:18:46,569
As am I.

312
00:18:49,216 --> 00:18:52,549
- What are you doing?
- An experiment.

313
00:18:54,054 --> 00:18:56,887
Nope, nothing. Never mind.

314
00:19:08,202 --> 00:19:09,635
You realize you can't win.

315
00:19:09,870 --> 00:19:11,770
I prefer to think that I can't lose.

316
00:19:16,009 --> 00:19:22,039
You're wrong. It's only a matter of time
before you fall into Rat Man's Rat Trap.

317
00:19:22,216 --> 00:19:26,516
You pathetic fool. If there were a
rat catcher, wouldn't it catch Rat Man?

318
00:19:27,087 --> 00:19:29,146
Just because
I didn't express myself well...

319
00:19:29,323 --> 00:19:33,020
...doesn't mean my underlying point
wasn't valid, you bloviating buffoon.

320
00:19:33,594 --> 00:19:35,562
You narcissistic nincompoop.

321
00:19:35,729 --> 00:19:37,321
You crimson coward!

322
00:19:37,531 --> 00:19:40,523
Leonard, wake up. You're missing
some excellent superhero quips.
