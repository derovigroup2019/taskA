1
00:00:02,863 --> 00:00:04,802
Hey, so I saw a movie trailer
the other day.

2
00:00:04,855 --> 00:00:07,213
How could Batman
possibly fight Superman?

3
00:00:07,214 --> 00:00:08,746
I mean, isn't that dumb?

4
00:00:08,748 --> 00:00:10,048
Maybe he uses Kryptonite.

5
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:12,050
Well, Batman's got
a lot of money.

6
00:00:12,052 --> 00:00:15,019
Maybe he builds a suit that can
do everything Superman can do.

7
00:00:15,021 --> 00:00:16,354
No, no, no, no, no.

8
00:00:16,356 --> 00:00:18,289
I've seen that movie.
It's called<i> Iron Man.</i>

9
00:00:25,732 --> 00:00:27,866
(quietly):
What is happening?

10
00:00:27,868 --> 00:00:30,368
I don't know.

11
00:00:30,370 --> 00:00:32,871
But it's beautiful.

12
00:00:34,407 --> 00:00:35,974
And now Ben Affleck
is Batman?

13
00:00:35,976 --> 00:00:38,176
Oh, he was great in
<i>Shakespeare in Love.</i>

14
00:00:38,178 --> 00:00:40,178
Ooh, we should watch that
next girls' night.

15
00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:41,379
We could do a double feature

16
00:00:41,381 --> 00:00:42,947
with the Leonardo DiCaprio
<i>Romeo + Juliet.</i>

17
00:00:42,949 --> 00:00:44,716
Oh, I love me some Leo.

18
00:00:44,718 --> 00:00:46,384
And it's gone.

19
00:00:47,454 --> 00:00:49,320
Oh, hello, everyone.

20
00:00:49,322 --> 00:00:52,257
I am happy to report
I'm feeling much better.

21
00:00:52,259 --> 00:00:53,658
Good for you.

22
00:00:53,660 --> 00:00:54,859
(muttering)

23
00:00:54,861 --> 00:00:57,662
My fever is gone,
my sinuses are pressure-free,

24
00:00:57,664 --> 00:01:01,165
and my mucus is as clear
as a Yosemite waterfall.

25
00:01:02,569 --> 00:01:04,669
Glad to hear it.

26
00:01:05,839 --> 00:01:08,540
I'll be able to return
to work tomorrow.

27
00:01:09,509 --> 00:01:11,943
Yay.

28
00:01:11,945 --> 00:01:14,412
Well, why isn't
everyone happy?

29
00:01:14,414 --> 00:01:18,149
Your little ray of sunshine
is ready to beam again.

30
00:01:18,985 --> 00:01:21,052
You really don't know why?
No.

31
00:01:21,054 --> 00:01:23,988
But I knew that his “yay”
was sarcastic.

32
00:01:23,990 --> 00:01:26,090
Not bad for a guy
whose last bowel movement

33
00:01:26,092 --> 00:01:28,259
sounded like rain on a roof.

34
00:01:30,297 --> 00:01:32,931
Let me refresh your memory.

35
00:01:33,833 --> 00:01:34,966
Penny,

36
00:01:34,968 --> 00:01:37,802
rub Vicks on my chest.

37
00:01:37,804 --> 00:01:40,605
Sheldon, I cooked you breakfast.

38
00:01:40,607 --> 00:01:42,040
I made your bed.

39
00:01:42,042 --> 00:01:43,942
I checked your mouth for thrush.

40
00:01:44,811 --> 00:01:46,878
You can rub your own chest.

41
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:49,480
Oh, sure, grope every other
male on the planet,

42
00:01:49,482 --> 00:01:51,082
but draw the line with me.

43
00:01:52,886 --> 00:01:55,420
I brought you a little
care package from work.

44
00:01:55,422 --> 00:01:56,621
It's our latest
antiviral

45
00:01:56,623 --> 00:01:58,590
and the best decongestant
we make.

46
00:01:58,592 --> 00:02:01,292
I hope laughter
is the best medicine,

47
00:02:01,294 --> 00:02:04,128
'cause this care package
is a joke.

48
00:02:04,965 --> 00:02:06,965
Hey, she came
all the way here...

49
00:02:06,967 --> 00:02:08,533
(sneezes)

50
00:02:12,505 --> 00:02:15,273
You're gonna want
to take these with food.

51
00:02:16,977 --> 00:02:19,577
Sheldon,
stop being a baby

52
00:02:19,579 --> 00:02:21,579
and let Emily
take a look at you.

53
00:02:21,581 --> 00:02:23,615
SHELDON: She's a
dermatologist.

54
00:02:23,617 --> 00:02:25,583
I went to medical school.

55
00:02:25,585 --> 00:02:27,485
Well, in that case,
try removing

56
00:02:27,487 --> 00:02:29,320
the irritating
patch of brown skin

57
00:02:29,322 --> 00:02:31,022
standing next to you.

58
00:02:33,727 --> 00:02:37,028
All right, here you go.

59
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:39,163
Leonard, I'm dying.

60
00:02:39,165 --> 00:02:41,666
You're not dying.
It's just the flu.

61
00:02:41,668 --> 00:02:43,001
I asked for chicken noodle.

62
00:02:43,003 --> 00:02:46,104
This is chicken and stars.
It's killing me.

63
00:02:49,342 --> 00:02:52,010
I never did get
that chicken noodle, did I?

64
00:02:53,079 --> 00:02:56,648
? Our whole universe
was in a hot, dense state ?

65
00:02:56,650 --> 00:02:59,984
? Then nearly 14 billion years
ago expansion started... Wait! ?

66
00:02:59,986 --> 00:03:01,619
? The Earth began to cool ?

67
00:03:01,621 --> 00:03:04,155
? The autotrophs began to drool,
Neanderthals developed tools ?

68
00:03:04,157 --> 00:03:06,824
? We built the Wall ?
?<i> We built the pyramids</i> ?

69
00:03:06,826 --> 00:03:09,494
? Math, Science, History,
unraveling the mystery ?

70
00:03:09,496 --> 00:03:11,396
? That all started
with a big bang ?

71
00:03:11,398 --> 00:03:13,364
?<i> Bang!</i> ?

72
00:03:13,367 --> 00:03:17,367

74
00:03:21,969 --> 00:03:23,435
(Skype ringing)

75
00:03:23,437 --> 00:03:24,736
Hi, Sheldon.

76
00:03:24,739 --> 00:03:25,738
Hello.

77
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:27,540
Are you feeling any better?

78
00:03:27,542 --> 00:03:29,709
Physically, yes, but I'm upset

79
00:03:29,711 --> 00:03:33,279
because everyone's mad at me
for no good reason.

80
00:03:34,149 --> 00:03:36,315
Why don't you tell me
what happened,

81
00:03:36,317 --> 00:03:38,151
and in a gentle, loving way,

82
00:03:38,153 --> 00:03:41,220
I'll explain to you
why you're wrong.

83
00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:43,723
You know how, when you're sick,

84
00:03:43,725 --> 00:03:46,826
you're allowed to be cranky
and say whatever you want

85
00:03:46,828 --> 00:03:49,829
and other people's feelings
don't matter?

86
00:03:50,865 --> 00:03:54,801
Ooh. Gentle and loving--
this is gonna be tricky.

87
00:03:54,803 --> 00:03:56,736
I had a 101 fever.

88
00:03:56,738 --> 00:04:01,073
If that's not a time to verbally
abuse my loved ones, when is?

89
00:04:01,075 --> 00:04:06,512
Sheldon, when you're sick,
you can be... unbearable.

90
00:04:06,514 --> 00:04:08,748
That's why your friends
have been known

91
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:12,485
to work late
or sneak out to the movies

92
00:04:12,487 --> 00:04:15,087
or stay at
a neurobiology conference

93
00:04:15,089 --> 00:04:17,690
three days after it's ended.

94
00:04:17,692 --> 00:04:21,360
You stayed in Michigan all week
to avoid being around me?

95
00:04:21,362 --> 00:04:23,196
No, no, not just that.

96
00:04:23,198 --> 00:04:24,497
I mean...

97
00:04:24,499 --> 00:04:27,400
Detroit is beautiful
when it's sleeting.

98
00:04:28,236 --> 00:04:30,102
You know, I'm not the only one

99
00:04:30,104 --> 00:04:31,637
who's unpleasant
when they're sick.

100
00:04:31,639 --> 00:04:34,340
When Penny got food poisoning,
she threw up so loudly

101
00:04:34,342 --> 00:04:37,076
I could barely hear
the television.

102
00:04:37,946 --> 00:04:39,479
Ooh, I just heard something.

103
00:04:39,481 --> 00:04:40,847
Might be hail, might be gunfire.

104
00:04:40,849 --> 00:04:43,616
Either way, I'm gonna go
take pictures. Bye.

105
00:04:45,787 --> 00:04:47,119
Hey, Stuart.

106
00:04:47,121 --> 00:04:49,055
Hey. Where's Sheldon?

107
00:04:49,057 --> 00:04:50,156
Still sick?
LEONARD: No, he's fine.

108
00:04:50,158 --> 00:04:52,625
We just needed
a little break.

109
00:04:52,627 --> 00:04:53,759
Yeah, I get that.

110
00:04:53,761 --> 00:04:55,628
When I brought him his comics
the other day,

111
00:04:55,630 --> 00:04:58,731
he said, “Oh, great,
Death is literally at my door.”

112
00:05:00,034 --> 00:05:01,868
He was being a jerk
to everyone.

113
00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:03,102
Don't take it personally.

114
00:05:03,104 --> 00:05:05,204
Oh, I'm on so many
antidepressants,

115
00:05:05,206 --> 00:05:07,473
I couldn't if I wanted to.

116
00:05:08,776 --> 00:05:11,944
I wish we could do more stuff
without Sheldon.

117
00:05:11,946 --> 00:05:14,580
I wish that all the time.

118
00:05:14,582 --> 00:05:18,951
Usually before I blow
out birthday candles.

119
00:05:18,953 --> 00:05:21,787
You know, Amy took
some time off from him.

120
00:05:21,789 --> 00:05:24,223
Really improved
their relationship.

121
00:05:24,225 --> 00:05:25,625
Huh. Okay.

122
00:05:25,627 --> 00:05:28,160
As long as it doesn't end
with us having coitus with him,

123
00:05:28,162 --> 00:05:29,495
I'm in.

124
00:05:30,565 --> 00:05:32,765
We should all take
a trip or something.

125
00:05:32,767 --> 00:05:34,467
You know, Penny and
I have been talking

126
00:05:34,469 --> 00:05:35,801
about taking a
weekend in Vegas.

127
00:05:35,803 --> 00:05:37,403
Maybe we should all go.

128
00:05:37,405 --> 00:05:39,138
Bernie would love that.

129
00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:40,373
Oh! Ooh! Maybe we could get

130
00:05:40,375 --> 00:05:42,341
one of those party buses
to take us there.

131
00:05:42,343 --> 00:05:43,643
That sounds really fun.

132
00:05:43,645 --> 00:05:44,710
Yeah, that sounds fun.

133
00:05:44,712 --> 00:05:46,312
A party-bus party don't stop.

134
00:05:46,314 --> 00:05:49,215
Ooh! When I say “party,”
you say “bus.”

135
00:05:49,217 --> 00:05:51,951
No. No.
(in rhythm): No. No!

136
00:05:54,188 --> 00:05:56,055
So, the guys and I
were talking about

137
00:05:56,057 --> 00:05:58,291
renting a party bus and
everyone going to Vegas.

138
00:05:58,293 --> 00:05:59,825
Oh, that could be fun.

139
00:05:59,827 --> 00:06:02,128
But just to be clear,
you mean a party bus

140
00:06:02,130 --> 00:06:03,462
with booze and music, right,

141
00:06:03,464 --> 00:06:05,898
not, like, juice boxes
and video games?

142
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:07,333
Yes.

143
00:06:07,335 --> 00:06:09,835
And Howard's birthday
was a drop-off party.

144
00:06:09,837 --> 00:06:12,471
You didn't have to stay.

145
00:06:12,473 --> 00:06:13,773
Well, I'm in.

146
00:06:13,775 --> 00:06:15,308
When are we going?
This weekend.

147
00:06:15,310 --> 00:06:17,343
Oh, where are we going?

148
00:06:18,179 --> 00:06:19,745
Well, Vegas, but...

149
00:06:19,747 --> 00:06:21,581
Ugh, Atlantic City
without the taffy?

150
00:06:21,583 --> 00:06:23,115
No, thank you.

151
00:06:24,285 --> 00:06:26,452
That's fine, 'cause actually
you're not invited.

152
00:06:26,454 --> 00:06:28,487
Well, now...
well, that's hurtful.

153
00:06:28,489 --> 00:06:30,623
Oh, Sheldon, you don't
even like it there.

154
00:06:30,625 --> 00:06:32,191
I can consider a place

155
00:06:32,193 --> 00:06:33,459
America's urinal cake

156
00:06:33,461 --> 00:06:36,195
and still enjoy
the occasional visit.

157
00:06:36,197 --> 00:06:37,964
Not this time.

158
00:06:37,966 --> 00:06:40,499
Oh, fine. Then I'll just
hang out with Wolowitz.

159
00:06:40,501 --> 00:06:43,102
He's coming, too.
Well, then Raj and I will...

160
00:06:43,104 --> 00:06:45,871
Nope.
Very well. Stuart.

161
00:06:45,873 --> 00:06:47,373
Oh, great. Do that.

162
00:06:48,876 --> 00:06:51,344
Ugh. Stuart.

163
00:06:52,547 --> 00:06:54,513
Hi, Sheldon. What's new?

164
00:06:54,515 --> 00:06:57,049
Our friends are jerks,
and I'm mad at all of them.

165
00:06:57,051 --> 00:06:59,919
I said, “What's new?” but sure.

166
00:07:00,722 --> 00:07:02,254
Can you believe
they planned a trip

167
00:07:02,256 --> 00:07:04,223
to Las Vegas
and didn't invite me?

168
00:07:04,225 --> 00:07:05,858
Did you refuse to apologize

169
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:08,260
and act like they were stupid
for being mad?

170
00:07:09,297 --> 00:07:11,330
You know, I liked it better
when there was still

171
00:07:11,332 --> 00:07:13,599
a little mystery left
in our relationship.

172
00:07:14,402 --> 00:07:16,435
Everyone tried
to take care of you,

173
00:07:16,437 --> 00:07:18,571
and you were nothing
but mean to them.

174
00:07:18,573 --> 00:07:20,406
I can't believe
you're not on my side.

175
00:07:20,408 --> 00:07:24,677
I was on your side when someone
stole your car radio.

176
00:07:25,813 --> 00:07:29,115
Who else's side
could you have been on?

177
00:07:29,117 --> 00:07:31,217
I don't know.

178
00:07:31,219 --> 00:07:34,420
A music-loving hobo
with a heart of gold?

179
00:07:35,723 --> 00:07:37,556
Sheldon, I understand
that you're upset

180
00:07:37,558 --> 00:07:39,225
because you feel left out,

181
00:07:39,227 --> 00:07:41,761
but I don't know why
we're even talking about this.

182
00:07:41,763 --> 00:07:43,496
Just apologize to them.

183
00:07:43,498 --> 00:07:47,099
Fine, if that's what it takes
to go on their dumb trip.

184
00:07:47,101 --> 00:07:50,269
Maybe you could try apologizing
because you actually feel bad.

185
00:07:50,271 --> 00:07:51,337
It's called empathy.

186
00:07:51,339 --> 00:07:53,773
It's something
you could work on.

187
00:07:53,775 --> 00:07:55,508
I have empathy.

188
00:07:55,510 --> 00:07:57,009
Watch.

189
00:07:57,011 --> 00:08:00,212
Leonard made me soup,
and I was mean to him.

190
00:08:03,484 --> 00:08:05,017
Great.

191
00:08:05,019 --> 00:08:08,954
Now try it as if this isn't
your first day as a person.

192
00:08:08,956 --> 00:08:11,023
Fine.

193
00:08:11,025 --> 00:08:14,627
Leonard made me soup,
and I was mean to him.

194
00:08:14,629 --> 00:08:16,796
Hey, I felt a little something.

195
00:08:16,798 --> 00:08:18,164
Let me try again.

196
00:08:18,166 --> 00:08:22,702
Leonard made me soup,
and I was mean to him.

197
00:08:22,704 --> 00:08:24,970
I was mean to him.

198
00:08:24,972 --> 00:08:27,373
He must have felt terrible.

199
00:08:27,375 --> 00:08:30,376
Oh, now I feel terrible.

200
00:08:30,378 --> 00:08:32,778
Neat!

201
00:08:33,614 --> 00:08:35,281
Glad I could help.

202
00:08:35,283 --> 00:08:37,349
Now let me see you
feel bad for lying

203
00:08:37,351 --> 00:08:39,952
and staying in Detroit
longer than you needed to.

204
00:08:39,954 --> 00:08:43,489
(flatly):
I feel so, so bad.

205
00:08:43,491 --> 00:08:46,459
Hey, we're both great at this.

206
00:08:50,198 --> 00:08:53,165
Leonard, get ready
for an apology.

207
00:08:53,167 --> 00:08:56,302
And with the added twist
of an M. Night Shyamalan movie,

208
00:08:56,304 --> 00:08:58,304
I'm going to mean it.

209
00:08:58,306 --> 00:08:59,972
Ah, so like every other

210
00:08:59,974 --> 00:09:01,540
M. Night Shyamalan movie
I've seen,

211
00:09:01,542 --> 00:09:04,243
you spoil it in advance.

212
00:09:04,245 --> 00:09:05,811
Hey, if you didn't know
Bruce Willis

213
00:09:05,813 --> 00:09:08,681
was dead the whole time,
that's not on me.

214
00:09:10,718 --> 00:09:12,284
Okay.

215
00:09:12,286 --> 00:09:13,753
Here it comes.

216
00:09:13,755 --> 00:09:15,087
You tried to take care of me

217
00:09:15,089 --> 00:09:17,356
when I was sick,
and I was mean to you.

218
00:09:17,358 --> 00:09:19,458
There's no excuse for that.

219
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:21,660
And I'm truly sorry.

220
00:09:21,662 --> 00:09:23,662
Thank you.

221
00:09:23,664 --> 00:09:24,997
I appreciate that.

222
00:09:24,999 --> 00:09:27,066
I want you to know
that that is sincere.

223
00:09:27,068 --> 00:09:28,334
I-I do feel bad.

224
00:09:28,336 --> 00:09:30,536
I'm not just saying it
to be included on your trip.

225
00:09:30,538 --> 00:09:32,738
Appreciate that, too.

226
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:34,140
Terrific.

227
00:09:34,142 --> 00:09:36,142
Now all that's left
is for you to invite me to come.

228
00:09:36,144 --> 00:09:37,409
Me to ask, “Are you sure?”

229
00:09:37,411 --> 00:09:38,577
You to say, “Absolutely.”

230
00:09:38,579 --> 00:09:39,678
And then me
to bring it home with,

231
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:42,414
“How could I say no
to that face?”

232
00:09:42,416 --> 00:09:45,050
You're still not coming.

233
00:09:45,052 --> 00:09:47,419
What? But I apologized
and I meant it.

234
00:09:47,421 --> 00:09:49,188
I know that we don't play
this game very often,

235
00:09:49,190 --> 00:09:51,257
but you're doing it wrong.

236
00:09:51,259 --> 00:09:54,026
Sheldon, I accept
your apology, but you upset

237
00:09:54,028 --> 00:09:55,327
a lot of people
while you were sick.

238
00:09:55,329 --> 00:09:57,463
I'm not in a position
to just say you can come.

239
00:09:57,465 --> 00:09:59,665
Well, all right.

240
00:09:59,667 --> 00:10:02,868
What if I apologize
to all of them?

241
00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:04,804
Fine, if you
apologize to everyone,

242
00:10:04,806 --> 00:10:07,006
they all say it's okay,
then yes, you can come.

243
00:10:07,008 --> 00:10:08,474
Challenge accepted!

244
00:10:08,476 --> 00:10:11,610
Sounds like it's time for
the Sheldon Cooper Apology Tour.

245
00:10:13,915 --> 00:10:15,214
Well, I hope
it's as much fun

246
00:10:15,216 --> 00:10:18,784
as the Sheldon Cooper
Spell-Checks Local Menus Tour.

247
00:10:18,786 --> 00:10:20,452
(laughing):
My goodness!

248
00:10:20,454 --> 00:10:23,722
Do you remember
“comes with apsparagus”?

249

Advertise your product or brand here

250
00:10:32,944 --> 00:10:34,844
Howard and Bernadette,

251
00:10:34,846 --> 00:10:36,846
you tried to comfort me
when I was ill,

252
00:10:36,848 --> 00:10:39,115
and I treated you terribly.

253
00:10:39,117 --> 00:10:40,717
I'm sorry.

254
00:10:40,719 --> 00:10:42,452
Wow.
(chuckles)

255
00:10:42,454 --> 00:10:43,686
I'm impressed.

256
00:10:43,688 --> 00:10:44,721
No, no, no, wait.

257
00:10:44,723 --> 00:10:45,789
I'm not done.

258
00:10:45,791 --> 00:10:47,924
Allow me to underscore
my sentiment

259
00:10:47,926 --> 00:10:49,692
with a haunting rendition

260
00:10:49,694 --> 00:10:51,528
of Brenda Lee's “I'm Sorry”

261
00:10:51,530 --> 00:10:53,696
played on the pan flute.

262
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:57,667
Apology accepted!
Forgiven, forgiven!

263
00:10:57,669 --> 00:11:01,070
All right, that's eight hours
of practice down the drain.

264
00:11:03,208 --> 00:11:05,708
And to memorialize
this occasion,

265
00:11:05,710 --> 00:11:08,611
here are your
commemorative T-shirts.

266
00:11:13,518 --> 00:11:16,719
“Sheldon Cooper
apologized to me”"

267
00:11:16,721 --> 00:11:19,789
“And he made it
all better.”

268
00:11:21,126 --> 00:11:22,792
(camera clicks)

269
00:11:24,930 --> 00:11:26,930
All you did was offer

270
00:11:26,932 --> 00:11:29,065
maternal care and affection,

271
00:11:29,067 --> 00:11:30,967
and all you received in return

272
00:11:30,969 --> 00:11:34,304
was rude and insensitive
behavior.

273
00:11:34,306 --> 00:11:36,406
Can this wait?

274
00:11:36,408 --> 00:11:37,874
I'm afraid it can't.

275
00:11:37,876 --> 00:11:39,042
The trip is tomorrow.

276
00:11:39,044 --> 00:11:40,844
And I have
more apologies to make.

277
00:11:40,846 --> 00:11:43,146
Okay, fine, I accept
your apology, now get out!

278
00:11:43,148 --> 00:11:45,081
Wonderful. would you mind
holding up this shirt

279
00:11:45,083 --> 00:11:47,317
while I take a quick...?
Leonard!

280
00:11:50,188 --> 00:11:53,623
You brought me my comic books
when I wasn't feeling well.

281
00:11:53,625 --> 00:11:55,625
That-that was
thoughtful.

282
00:11:55,627 --> 00:11:56,793
And I was insensitive.

283
00:11:56,795 --> 00:11:58,228
I'm sorry.

284
00:11:58,230 --> 00:11:59,829
Thank you, Sheldon.

285
00:11:59,831 --> 00:12:01,598
I appreciate that.

286
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:04,133
And I want you to know
that I mean it, you know?

287
00:12:04,135 --> 00:12:08,204
This isn't me just wanting to
go on the trip to Las Vegas.

288
00:12:11,042 --> 00:12:14,177
What trip to Las Vegas?

289
00:12:14,179 --> 00:12:16,145
The one everyone's taking

290
00:12:16,147 --> 00:12:18,648
this weekend on the party bus.

291
00:12:18,650 --> 00:12:21,084
Of course, I wasn't invited.

292
00:12:21,086 --> 00:12:24,988
That would be my understanding.

293
00:12:26,057 --> 00:12:27,924
On a less painful subject,

294
00:12:27,926 --> 00:12:29,959
what size T-shirt do you take?

295
00:12:33,098 --> 00:12:35,932
Raj, you were being
a good friend,

296
00:12:35,934 --> 00:12:39,602
and my illness was no
excuse for my behavior.

297
00:12:39,604 --> 00:12:42,739
I hope that you can
accept my apology.

298
00:12:42,741 --> 00:12:44,607
Of course I do.

299
00:12:44,609 --> 00:12:47,610
And, Emily, I'm sorry
for saying dermatologists

300
00:12:47,612 --> 00:12:49,546
aren't real doctors.

301
00:12:49,548 --> 00:12:52,916
And I'm sure you're
tired of hearing that.

302
00:12:55,053 --> 00:12:58,021
Do you honestly think
I hear that a lot?

303
00:12:58,023 --> 00:13:00,456
Well, I would imagine
when your job is popping zits

304
00:13:00,458 --> 00:13:02,792
and squirting Botox
into old lady faces...

305
00:13:02,794 --> 00:13:04,093
Okay!

306
00:13:04,095 --> 00:13:06,796
Okay, the point is

307
00:13:06,798 --> 00:13:09,032
that we accept
your apology.

308
00:13:09,034 --> 00:13:10,199
Uh, maybe you do.

309
00:13:10,201 --> 00:13:12,001
He just insulted me again.

310
00:13:12,003 --> 00:13:13,670
Yeah, but he
doesn't mean it.

311
00:13:13,672 --> 00:13:15,338
Why are you defending him?

312
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:16,573
(stammers) I believe
I can answer that.

313
00:13:16,575 --> 00:13:17,740
Uh, like me,

314
00:13:17,742 --> 00:13:19,742
Raj is demonstrating empathy.

315
00:13:19,744 --> 00:13:22,011
Now, why don't you
accept my apology,

316
00:13:22,013 --> 00:13:24,781
receive your free T-shirt, uh--

317
00:13:24,783 --> 00:13:26,783
I hope extra small is okay.

318
00:13:26,785 --> 00:13:29,719
For some reason
Wolowitz took a medium.

319
00:13:30,789 --> 00:13:33,389
Well, I don't
accept your apology.

320
00:13:33,391 --> 00:13:34,657
What are you doing?

321
00:13:34,659 --> 00:13:36,626
It's called standing
up for myself.

322
00:13:36,628 --> 00:13:37,760
You should try it some time.

323
00:13:37,762 --> 00:13:40,463
Fine, how about this?

324
00:13:40,465 --> 00:13:42,699
You're making me
uncomfortable by prolonging

325
00:13:42,701 --> 00:13:44,901
this ridiculous fight,
and I wish you'd stop.

326
00:13:44,903 --> 00:13:46,536
Oh, you want me to stop?

327
00:13:46,538 --> 00:13:47,570
No problem.

328
00:13:47,572 --> 00:13:49,038
No, come on,
please don't leave!

329
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:50,306
(Sheldon stammers)

330
00:13:50,308 --> 00:13:51,941
Point of clarification--
are you still going on the trip?

331
00:13:51,943 --> 00:13:53,109
Because if not...

332
00:13:53,111 --> 00:13:55,078
Don't worry, you're good.

333
00:13:57,515 --> 00:14:00,416
I caused that fight,
I feel terrible.

334
00:14:00,418 --> 00:14:03,486
(stammers)
Wait, I can do that better...

335
00:14:04,456 --> 00:14:06,756
I caused that fight.

336
00:14:06,758 --> 00:14:08,124
I feel terrible.

337
00:14:08,126 --> 00:14:11,561
Yeah, wow, I don't know
which one I like more.

338
00:14:12,664 --> 00:14:14,897
So, was the fight
really bad?

339
00:14:14,899 --> 00:14:16,132
(stammers)
No.

340
00:14:16,134 --> 00:14:17,834
As a fight, it was excellent.

341
00:14:17,836 --> 00:14:21,037
She used harsh language
and slammed the door.

342
00:14:21,039 --> 00:14:22,772
Although as I say this,

343
00:14:22,774 --> 00:14:25,108
that might not have been
what you were asking.

344
00:14:25,110 --> 00:14:27,844
You think they'll
still go on the trip?

345
00:14:27,846 --> 00:14:29,946
All I know is after the fight
I went to Emily's to smooth...

346
00:14:29,948 --> 00:14:32,915
They're not going on the trip.
No.

347
00:14:34,252 --> 00:14:36,452
What is wrong with you?

348
00:14:36,454 --> 00:14:39,756
Look at him, caring about
what's wrong with me.

349
00:14:39,758 --> 00:14:42,425
That is some top-shelf empathy.

350
00:14:44,262 --> 00:14:46,763
Hey, well,
we should start a club.

351
00:14:46,765 --> 00:14:49,432
You went to Emily's
to apologize.

352
00:14:49,434 --> 00:14:51,968
And when you left,
she was crying.

353
00:14:51,970 --> 00:14:53,336
That is true.

354
00:14:53,338 --> 00:14:56,072
Well, I suppose
I should apologize again.

355
00:14:56,074 --> 00:14:58,775
(all saying no)

356
00:14:58,777 --> 00:14:59,909
Is she okay?

357
00:14:59,911 --> 00:15:01,878
Yeah, I calmed her down.

358
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:04,213
But she's not going
to Vegas if he's going.

359
00:15:04,215 --> 00:15:06,149
Wait, that's an option?

360
00:15:06,151 --> 00:15:09,419
I didn't know that
was an option.

361
00:15:09,421 --> 00:15:10,753
Well, that is fine,
because I've decided

362
00:15:10,755 --> 00:15:12,188
that I won't be joining you.

363
00:15:12,190 --> 00:15:14,424
I've realized that
the most genuine way

364
00:15:14,426 --> 00:15:16,693
to demonstrate the remorse
I feel is to let you

365
00:15:16,695 --> 00:15:18,961
have this weekend
to yourselves.

366
00:15:19,764 --> 00:15:22,632
That's very mature of you.

367
00:15:22,634 --> 00:15:24,567
Well, I've been on a little
trip myself recently.

368
00:15:24,569 --> 00:15:28,237
Not to Sin City
but to Sincere City.

369
00:15:30,308 --> 00:15:31,974
Where instead of genital warts,
the only growth

370
00:15:31,976 --> 00:15:35,011
you'll come back with
is personal growth.

371
00:15:36,081 --> 00:15:38,848
And there's your next T-shirt.

372
00:15:41,786 --> 00:15:44,587
Ooh, check out
the stripper pole.

373
00:15:44,589 --> 00:15:45,988
You know what that means.

374
00:15:45,990 --> 00:15:48,958
That Raj'll be on it before
we make it to the freeway?

375
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:50,593
You know it!

376
00:15:50,595 --> 00:15:52,662
(whooping)

377
00:15:54,199 --> 00:15:55,565
This is so cool.

378
00:15:55,567 --> 00:15:56,966
Let's have champagne!

379
00:15:56,968 --> 00:15:58,701
Mm-hmm.

380
00:15:58,703 --> 00:16:01,370
Well, I would like
to propose a toast

381
00:16:01,372 --> 00:16:02,872
to a well-deserved weekend of...

382
00:16:02,874 --> 00:16:04,674
Aha!
(all scream)

383
00:16:06,878 --> 00:16:09,312
What are you doing?!

384
00:16:09,314 --> 00:16:11,948
My plan was to jump out
at the state line,

385
00:16:11,950 --> 00:16:15,485
but one of my nose plugs
fell into the toilet.

386
00:16:15,487 --> 00:16:19,088
You couldn't give us
just one weekend?

387
00:16:19,090 --> 00:16:21,624
I told him
this was a bad idea.

388
00:16:24,763 --> 00:16:26,395
What do we do--
kick them off?

389
00:16:26,397 --> 00:16:27,964
If we drop them off
at a fire station,

390
00:16:27,966 --> 00:16:30,900
they have to take them;
no questions asked.

391
00:16:30,902 --> 00:16:34,971
Before you do, please
give me one more chance

392
00:16:34,973 --> 00:16:36,973
to apologize to Emily.

393
00:16:36,975 --> 00:16:38,708
Oh, God.

394
00:16:38,710 --> 00:16:41,844
Emily, as I'm
sure you know,

395
00:16:41,846 --> 00:16:44,747
I'm considered
an odd fellow.

396
00:16:46,818 --> 00:16:48,618
But what you don't know
is that, while I often

397
00:16:48,620 --> 00:16:52,188
say the wrong thing,
in my heart I mean well.

398
00:16:52,190 --> 00:16:54,090
I think that you are

399
00:16:54,092 --> 00:16:57,093
a smart and wonderful
woman, you know?

400
00:16:57,095 --> 00:17:00,730
And we all think that you can
do better than Koothrappali.

401
00:17:01,766 --> 00:17:03,399
You know, Sheldon...

402
00:17:03,401 --> 00:17:06,202
Shh, let him finish.

403
00:17:06,204 --> 00:17:08,171
So, for all the times
I've offended you

404
00:17:08,173 --> 00:17:10,740
and all the times that
I'll offend you in the future,

405
00:17:10,742 --> 00:17:13,643
I'm sorry.

406
00:17:15,180 --> 00:17:16,479
Thank you.

407
00:17:16,481 --> 00:17:17,914
Good.

408
00:17:17,916 --> 00:17:20,016
Then I'll be leaving now.

409
00:17:20,018 --> 00:17:22,318
Oh, it's okay, Sheldon.

410
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:24,487
Come with us.

411
00:17:24,489 --> 00:17:26,789
Oh, that's very kind of you.

412
00:17:26,791 --> 00:17:29,325
But I'm sure you'll all have
a better time without me.

413
00:17:29,327 --> 00:17:30,827
Let's go, Stuart.

414
00:17:30,829 --> 00:17:32,328
But I want to stay.

415
00:17:32,330 --> 00:17:33,663
Stuart, now!

416
00:17:41,005 --> 00:17:42,471
You know,
I know he's a jerk,

417
00:17:42,473 --> 00:17:44,173
but I actually
feel bad for him.

418
00:17:44,175 --> 00:17:48,110
And now you see
the problem.

419
00:17:50,281 --> 00:17:53,683
Come on, you pain in the ass!

420
00:17:53,685 --> 00:17:55,051
That's me!

421
00:17:55,053 --> 00:17:56,519
Bye, Stuart.

422
00:17:56,521 --> 00:17:58,621
Wait!

423
00:17:58,623 --> 00:18:02,058
I'm a pain in the ass, too!

424
00:18:10,426 --> 00:18:12,627
Are you relieved
that you and Raj

425
00:18:12,629 --> 00:18:14,629
were able
to patch things up?

426
00:18:14,631 --> 00:18:16,163
At the moment?

427
00:18:16,165 --> 00:18:18,165
No, not really.

428
00:18:18,167 --> 00:18:19,600
? Burn, baby, burn... ?

429
00:18:19,602 --> 00:18:21,369
Shake it, baby!

430
00:18:21,371 --> 00:18:24,171
(whoops)
Work that thing!
