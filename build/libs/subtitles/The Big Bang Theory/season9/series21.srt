1
00:00:02,563 --> 00:00:05,398
I have a question
about Batman.

2
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:09,539
Batman is a man
who dresses up like a bat.

3
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:13,909
Man-bat is a part man,
part bat hybrid.

4
00:00:13,911 --> 00:00:15,343
Now,

5
00:00:15,345 --> 00:00:18,647
if Man-Bat dressed up as a man
to fight crime,

6
00:00:18,649 --> 00:00:21,983
would he be Man-Batman?

7
00:00:21,985 --> 00:00:25,087
No, he'd be Bat-Man-Bat.

8
00:00:26,123 --> 00:00:28,490
But wouldn't Man-Batman
just be a Batman

9
00:00:28,492 --> 00:00:31,126
that was bitten by
a radioactive man?

10
00:00:31,128 --> 00:00:33,095
But Batman is a man.

11
00:00:33,097 --> 00:00:36,131
You're talking about a man who
would have the powers of a man.

12
00:00:36,133 --> 00:00:39,134
That's just Man-Man.

13
00:00:39,136 --> 00:00:40,969
Well, isn't Man-Man just Man?

14
00:00:40,971 --> 00:00:42,938
But what if Man-Man
dressed as a bat?

15
00:00:42,940 --> 00:00:43,839
Well, that's just Batman.

16
00:00:43,841 --> 00:00:45,874
No, if a man dresses as a bat,

17
00:00:45,876 --> 00:00:48,043
that's Batman,
but if Man-Man dresses as a bat,

18
00:00:48,045 --> 00:00:49,845
that's Batman-Man.

19
00:00:49,847 --> 00:00:51,413
(cell phone chimes)

20
00:00:51,415 --> 00:00:52,948
So does that answer
your question?

21
00:00:52,950 --> 00:00:55,650
Oh, I haven't asked it yet.

22
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:58,019
Oh, that's Claire.
Got to run.

23
00:00:58,021 --> 00:01:00,055
I thought you were back
with Emily.

24
00:01:00,057 --> 00:01:02,757
Uh, actually I'm...
seeing both of them.

25
00:01:02,759 --> 00:01:06,461
You mean like through their
window from behind a bush?

26
00:01:07,931 --> 00:01:10,799
No, I'm actually dating
two women.

27
00:01:10,801 --> 00:01:13,502
Later.

28
00:01:13,504 --> 00:01:15,337
(chuckles)
Really?

29
00:01:15,339 --> 00:01:17,672
The guy who for years
couldn't even talk to women

30
00:01:17,674 --> 00:01:19,307
is suddenly going out
with two of them?

31
00:01:19,309 --> 00:01:21,176
How is that possible?
WOLOWITZ: I know.

32
00:01:21,178 --> 00:01:22,644
Scientists have tried
to reproduce it

33
00:01:22,646 --> 00:01:23,879
with computational models,

34
00:01:23,881 --> 00:01:27,015
but, in each case,
the world blows up.

35
00:01:32,256 --> 00:01:34,556
Seriously, that guy's
dating two women?

36
00:01:35,692 --> 00:01:39,327
? Our whole universe
was in a hot, dense state ?

37
00:01:39,329 --> 00:01:42,664
? Then nearly 14 billion years
ago expansion started... Wait! ?

38
00:01:42,666 --> 00:01:44,299
? The Earth began to cool ?

39
00:01:44,301 --> 00:01:46,835
? The autotrophs began to drool,
Neanderthals developed tools ?

40
00:01:46,837 --> 00:01:49,504
? We built the Wall ?
? <i>We built the pyramids</i> ?

41
00:01:49,506 --> 00:01:52,174
? Math, Science, History,
unraveling the mystery ?

42
00:01:52,176 --> 00:01:54,075
? That all started
with a big bang ?

43
00:01:54,077 --> 00:01:56,044
? <i>Bang!</i> ?

44
00:01:56,068 --> 00:02:00,068

<font color=#00FFFF>@elder_man</font>

46
00:02:07,572 --> 00:02:09,305
What, why did you get
a party sub?

47
00:02:09,307 --> 00:02:11,374
People are coming over;
it looked fun.

48
00:02:11,376 --> 00:02:14,511
Well, we're only watching
<i>Game of Thrones.</i>

49
00:02:14,513 --> 00:02:15,912
A party sub implies
it's a party.

50
00:02:15,914 --> 00:02:19,849
Your attendance implies
it's not.

51
00:02:19,851 --> 00:02:22,185
I like a party
as much as the next man,

52
00:02:22,187 --> 00:02:24,287
as long as the next man
doesn't like a party.

53
00:02:24,289 --> 00:02:27,490
Oh, by the way,
don't forget,

54
00:02:27,492 --> 00:02:29,893
tomorrow is our quarterly
Roommate Agreement meeting.

55
00:02:29,895 --> 00:02:31,327
Oh, Sheldon, we don't
need a meeting

56
00:02:31,329 --> 00:02:32,729
every three months.
Hmm?

57
00:02:32,731 --> 00:02:35,131
Well, it sounds like the kind of
thing one would bring up

58
00:02:35,133 --> 00:02:36,599
at a quarterly
Roommate Agreement meeting.

59
00:02:36,601 --> 00:02:39,002
Lucky for you it's tomorrow.

60
00:02:39,004 --> 00:02:40,537
Oh, you know what?

61
00:02:40,539 --> 00:02:41,738
I'm not going.

62
00:02:41,740 --> 00:02:43,273
Well, you have to go.

63
00:02:43,275 --> 00:02:46,376
It's Penny's first time leading
the Pledge of Allegiance.

64
00:02:46,378 --> 00:02:49,679
This meeting is a waste of time.

65
00:02:49,681 --> 00:02:50,947
Whether we make the switch

66
00:02:50,949 --> 00:02:52,882
from Post Raisin Bran
to Kellogg's Raisin Bran

67
00:02:52,884 --> 00:02:55,852
should not require
parliamentary procedure.

68
00:02:55,854 --> 00:02:59,722
You realize one of them
has sugar on the raisins.

69
00:02:59,724 --> 00:03:02,525
You're the only one
who eats them!

70
00:03:02,527 --> 00:03:04,160
And yet you get to weigh in.

71
00:03:04,162 --> 00:03:05,828
Democracy-- it's pretty cool,
isn't it?

72
00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:08,865
I'm not going;
you can't make me.

73
00:03:08,867 --> 00:03:10,533
Well, we'll just see about that.

74
00:03:10,535 --> 00:03:12,035
What is the problem?

75
00:03:12,037 --> 00:03:13,102
He says he's not coming

76
00:03:13,104 --> 00:03:14,237
to the Roommate Agreement
meeting tomorrow.

77
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:17,040
Well, why the hell did
I memorize the Pledge?

78
00:03:19,044 --> 00:03:20,877
You have fun.
I will not be attending.

79
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:22,278
Oh, fine.
We don't have to have

80
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:23,880
a Roommate Agreement meeting
if you don't want to.

81
00:03:23,882 --> 00:03:25,848
Thank you.
Of course, it will require a vote.

82
00:03:25,850 --> 00:03:28,885
Unfortunately, my official gavel
is in my bedroom,

83
00:03:28,887 --> 00:03:31,087
but luckily,
I have my travel gavel.

84
00:03:33,959 --> 00:03:36,092
You're being ridiculous.

85
00:03:36,094 --> 00:03:37,694
There's a motion on the floor,
"I'm ridiculous."

86
00:03:37,696 --> 00:03:38,795
Do we have a second?

87
00:03:38,797 --> 00:03:40,330
Hmm? Hmm?
There is no second.

88
00:03:40,332 --> 00:03:41,497
The motion is denied.

89
00:03:41,499 --> 00:03:43,533
Next time, make sure
you have the votes first.

90
00:03:43,535 --> 00:03:44,534
That was embarrassing.

91
00:03:44,536 --> 00:03:47,403
Can you please
talk to him?

92
00:03:47,405 --> 00:03:49,105
Well, why are you
fighting him on this?

93
00:03:49,107 --> 00:03:51,741
Because I am tired of him
always getting his way.

94
00:03:51,743 --> 00:03:52,909
We don't need a stupid meeting.

95
00:03:52,911 --> 00:03:54,177
We don't even need
a Roommate Agreement,

96
00:03:54,179 --> 00:03:56,613
and I hope that sandwich
<i>does</i> cause a party!

97
00:03:58,383 --> 00:04:00,683
Well, I will still
come to your meeting.

98
00:04:00,685 --> 00:04:02,525
Well, I should hope so.
Tomorrow's picture day.

99
00:04:04,189 --> 00:04:06,155
Why are you
taking his side?

100
00:04:06,157 --> 00:04:07,490
Because it's
important to him,

101
00:04:07,492 --> 00:04:09,225
and when we signed the Roommate
Agreement, we made a deal.

102
00:04:09,227 --> 00:04:12,362
Y-You keep talking like that,
you're gonna make color guard.

103
00:04:14,933 --> 00:04:16,633
(video game sound effects
over TV)

104
00:04:16,635 --> 00:04:18,668
Man, I'm worn out.
I know.

105
00:04:18,670 --> 00:04:21,638
Imagine if we were
actually moving.

106
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:26,109
No, it's just, ever since I
started dating Claire and Emily

107
00:04:26,111 --> 00:04:29,545
at the same time,
it's exhausting.

108
00:04:29,547 --> 00:04:31,080
You're exhausted?

109
00:04:31,082 --> 00:04:33,383
Try folding every five pages
in a pregnancy book

110
00:04:33,385 --> 00:04:35,718
so your wife thinks you read it.

111
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:38,421
But, dude, you're so lucky.

112
00:04:38,423 --> 00:04:41,057
Getting to stay home at night
with the woman you love.

113
00:04:41,059 --> 00:04:42,859
I guess I am lucky.

114
00:04:42,861 --> 00:04:46,262
You are, because
dating two women,

115
00:04:46,264 --> 00:04:48,865
I mean, I can't even remember

116
00:04:48,867 --> 00:04:52,468
the last time I slept
in my own apartment.

117
00:04:52,470 --> 00:04:55,838
I wake up and I'm like, "Am I at
Claire's or am I at Emily's?

118
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:58,107
Is there a third girl
I've forgotten about?"

119
00:04:58,109 --> 00:04:59,609
Like...

120
00:04:59,611 --> 00:05:02,111
"Where am I?"

121
00:05:02,113 --> 00:05:03,579
Hey, Raj.

122
00:05:03,581 --> 00:05:05,348
Hey, how's the mommy-to-be?

123
00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:06,749
Good. A little tired.

124
00:05:06,751 --> 00:05:10,019
I feel you. I've been
dating multiple women.

125
00:05:11,056 --> 00:05:12,121
You sure you don't
want to come

126
00:05:12,123 --> 00:05:13,423
watch <i>Game of</i>
<i>Thrones</i> with us?

127
00:05:13,425 --> 00:05:14,657
You guys have fun.

128
00:05:14,659 --> 00:05:16,159
I'm just gonna snuggle up
in bed with a book.

129
00:05:16,161 --> 00:05:19,629
Oh, that sounds great--
a bed to yourself.

130
00:05:19,631 --> 00:05:22,832
Can't even remember
what that's like.

131
00:05:25,170 --> 00:05:27,603
Are you up-to-date
on <i>Game of Thrones?</i>

132
00:05:27,605 --> 00:05:28,838
Mm, I think so.

133
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:33,776
Dragons, snow zombies,
and all the hot guys are dead.

134
00:05:33,778 --> 00:05:35,678
Oh, I don't know.

135
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:36,946
Theon Greyjoy
looks pretty good

136
00:05:36,948 --> 00:05:39,248
for a guy who had his
genitals cut off.

137
00:05:42,721 --> 00:05:44,954
(singsongy): Uh-oh,
somebody's still pouting.

138
00:05:44,956 --> 00:05:46,055
Leave me alone.

139
00:05:46,057 --> 00:05:47,690
If it's because
you lost a stick,

140
00:05:47,692 --> 00:05:49,625
I know where it went.

141
00:05:51,463 --> 00:05:52,662
Not funny.

142
00:05:52,664 --> 00:05:53,896
You know you're gonna
make up with him.

143
00:05:53,898 --> 00:05:55,264
Can we just skip to that part?

144
00:05:55,266 --> 00:05:57,600
Oh, of course, because
I'm the only adult around here.

145
00:05:57,602 --> 00:05:59,135
Really? The only adult?

146
00:05:59,137 --> 00:06:00,937
Yeah, that's right.
SHELDON: You know, excuse me.

147
00:06:00,939 --> 00:06:03,005
Tonight I'll be watching
a show rated M.A.,

148
00:06:03,007 --> 00:06:06,075
and that stands for
"Mature Audiences," buster.

149
00:06:06,077 --> 00:06:08,378
All right, you would
think "the only adult"

150
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:10,980
wouldn't let something silly
ruin our entire night.

151
00:06:10,982 --> 00:06:13,316
And I'd think you'd understand
why I'm annoyed.

152
00:06:13,318 --> 00:06:16,519
All this could be avoided if
you'd just come to the meeting.

153
00:06:16,521 --> 00:06:17,387
I don't want to.

154
00:06:17,389 --> 00:06:18,388
Oh, it's just a meeting.

155
00:06:18,390 --> 00:06:20,757
One simple meeting.
Stop saying "meeting"!

156
00:06:20,759 --> 00:06:21,924
? Meeting, meeting, bo-beeting ?

157
00:06:21,926 --> 00:06:23,493
? Banana-fana, fo-feeting ?

158
00:06:23,495 --> 00:06:24,660
? Fee-fi mo-meeting... ?

159
00:06:24,662 --> 00:06:26,295
I brought
my famous spinach dip.

160
00:06:26,297 --> 00:06:27,663
Yo, Amy, just one second.

161
00:06:27,665 --> 00:06:28,931
? Meeting. ?

162
00:06:31,703 --> 00:06:35,638
I'm not sure if I'm hoping
for a boy or a girl.

163
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:36,906
I mean, if it's a boy,

164
00:06:36,908 --> 00:06:38,975
I'm gonna have to teach him
to play catch.

165
00:06:38,977 --> 00:06:40,543
(chuckles) Which means
I'm gonna have to Google

166
00:06:40,545 --> 00:06:41,811
"How to play catch."

167
00:06:43,114 --> 00:06:46,416
If it's a girl, I mean...

168
00:06:46,418 --> 00:06:50,019
they're so innocent and...
you know how guys are.

169
00:06:50,021 --> 00:06:52,221
Totally, guys are the worst.

170
00:06:52,223 --> 00:06:55,491
I mean, look at me.

171
00:06:55,493 --> 00:06:58,194
I let Emily make me a frittata

172
00:06:58,196 --> 00:07:01,431
and I kept the leftovers
in Claire's fridge that night.

173
00:07:01,433 --> 00:07:03,599
I'm such a dog.

174
00:07:06,404 --> 00:07:07,837
There you go again.

175
00:07:07,839 --> 00:07:10,973
I'm sorry, have I been
complaining about it too much?

176
00:07:10,975 --> 00:07:13,342
Actually, what you're doing is
pretending to complain,

177
00:07:13,344 --> 00:07:14,744
but really trying to brag.

178
00:07:14,746 --> 00:07:16,412
How could you say that?

179
00:07:16,414 --> 00:07:18,714
(imitates Koothrappali): "Oh,
I wish could enjoy a cup of tea

180
00:07:18,716 --> 00:07:22,885
without a naked girl
bouncing up and down on me."

181
00:07:22,887 --> 00:07:25,655
I never said that.

182
00:07:25,657 --> 00:07:28,224
"Don't you hate it when you
can't remember whose bra it is

183
00:07:28,226 --> 00:07:30,793
you found wedged in your couch?"

184
00:07:32,664 --> 00:07:34,730
Okay, that I said.

185
00:07:34,732 --> 00:07:36,766
But that's a real problem!

186
00:07:36,768 --> 00:07:38,634
You give a girl
another woman's bra,

187
00:07:38,636 --> 00:07:41,103
and you will not be
having sex with her that night.

188
00:07:41,105 --> 00:07:42,972
Maybe the other girl,
but not her.

189
00:07:50,348 --> 00:07:51,881
What's going on with him?

190
00:07:51,883 --> 00:07:53,249
Oh, he's all
bent out of shape

191
00:07:53,251 --> 00:07:55,151
about having
a Roommate Agreement meeting.

192
00:07:55,153 --> 00:07:58,754
Apparently, perfect attendance
isn't cool anymore.

193
00:07:59,657 --> 00:08:01,357
Don't worry,
he'll come around.

194
00:08:01,359 --> 00:08:03,192
Well, I get why he's annoyed.

195
00:08:03,194 --> 00:08:05,895
Well, then you don't
understand what's happening.

196
00:08:05,897 --> 00:08:07,530
See...

197
00:08:07,532 --> 00:08:08,764
Leonard refused to participate

198
00:08:08,766 --> 00:08:11,133
in a mandatory quarterly
Roommate Agreement meeting.

199
00:08:11,135 --> 00:08:15,004
This is what a generation raised
on Bart Simpson looks like.

200
00:08:15,006 --> 00:08:16,772
You love <i>The Simpsons.</i>

201
00:08:16,774 --> 00:08:19,942
I love Lisa Simpson.

202
00:08:22,113 --> 00:08:23,946
Well, I know how he feels.

203
00:08:23,948 --> 00:08:26,215
I never enjoyed our
Relationship Agreement meetings.

204
00:08:26,217 --> 00:08:27,917
(gasps) Wait.

205
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:29,018
You were pretending?

206
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:31,354
Sorry.

207
00:08:31,356 --> 00:08:32,955
No!

208
00:08:32,957 --> 00:08:35,558
I don't believe you.
I could tell.

209
00:08:40,698 --> 00:08:41,998
"Oh, Sheldon,

210
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,232
"I never thought

211
00:08:43,234 --> 00:08:44,600
"re-filing a matter

212
00:08:44,602 --> 00:08:49,372
in a standing subcommittee
could be so fascinating."

213
00:08:51,209 --> 00:08:55,077
Hmm, what do you think?

214
00:08:55,079 --> 00:08:57,947
You don't know?

215
00:09:01,352 --> 00:09:03,819
Hey, did I say
something to upset you?

216
00:09:03,821 --> 00:09:05,254
No, I'm fine.

217
00:09:05,256 --> 00:09:07,089
Really? Because usually
we walk side by side,

218
00:09:07,091 --> 00:09:09,125
and I just went up
two flights of stairs

219
00:09:09,127 --> 00:09:12,094
staring at your bottom.

220
00:09:12,096 --> 00:09:14,230
Just drop it.

221
00:09:14,232 --> 00:09:16,499
Okay, I think I see
what's happening here.

222
00:09:16,501 --> 00:09:17,767
You're jealous of me.

223
00:09:17,769 --> 00:09:19,001
Oh, please.

224
00:09:19,003 --> 00:09:21,537
What could you possibly have
that I would be jealous of?

225
00:09:21,539 --> 00:09:25,274
It's not what I have, it's how
many people I'm having it with.

226
00:09:27,011 --> 00:09:28,945
Come on, Sheldon, we'll watch
<i>Game of Thrones</i> over here.

227
00:09:28,947 --> 00:09:30,746
Gladly.
LEONARD: Oh, good, go.

228
00:09:30,748 --> 00:09:31,847
You know, it'll be nice

229
00:09:31,849 --> 00:09:33,616
to watch an episode
without someone saying,

230
00:09:33,618 --> 00:09:34,784
"I read the books.

231
00:09:34,786 --> 00:09:37,420
Don't get too fond
of <i>this</i> character."

232
00:09:37,422 --> 00:09:39,655
It's not always
because they die.

233
00:09:39,657 --> 00:09:41,591
In one case, it's because
they've become involved

234
00:09:41,593 --> 00:09:43,492
with underground tree people
from the dawn of time.

235
00:09:43,494 --> 00:09:45,227
Yeah, but I won't
say who it is.

236
00:09:45,229 --> 00:09:46,362
It's Bran!

237
00:09:47,765 --> 00:09:49,732
Wait, what is going on?

238
00:09:49,734 --> 00:09:51,734
Leonard's being a jerk,
so we're gonna watch over here,

239
00:09:51,736 --> 00:09:53,269
Do you guys want
to watch with us?

240
00:09:53,271 --> 00:09:54,870
As long as I don't
have to watch with him.

241
00:09:54,872 --> 00:09:56,505
Fine, I don't want to
watch with you either.

242
00:09:56,507 --> 00:09:57,473
I'll go over here.

243
00:09:57,475 --> 00:09:58,741
Why do you get to pick?

244
00:09:58,743 --> 00:09:59,875
Okay, then you go there!

245
00:09:59,877 --> 00:10:02,244
Don't tell me where to go!

246
00:10:02,246 --> 00:10:03,713
Howard, just come in here.

247
00:10:03,715 --> 00:10:05,481
Yeah, come on, Raj.

248
00:10:05,483 --> 00:10:07,650
Wait, did Amy make
her spinach dip?

249
00:10:07,652 --> 00:10:08,651
She did.

250
00:10:08,653 --> 00:10:10,720
And I'm gonna eat it all!

251
00:10:10,722 --> 00:10:12,888
(door slams)

252
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:20,074
Advertise your product or brand here

253
00:10:21,231 --> 00:10:22,864
So what the hell happened?

254
00:10:22,866 --> 00:10:25,167
Oh, I just ran out of patience
with Sheldon's nonsense.

255
00:10:25,169 --> 00:10:27,869
Tell me about it.
I've had it with Raj, too.

256
00:10:27,871 --> 00:10:31,006
You know, like women, men have
a monthly hormone cycle.

257
00:10:31,008 --> 00:10:33,141
Dips in testosterone
can cause irritability.

258
00:10:33,143 --> 00:10:34,643
Interesting.

259
00:10:34,645 --> 00:10:39,414
Maybe my male cycle synced up
with Raj's actual period.

260
00:10:41,018 --> 00:10:44,553
If Sheldon's testosterone
dipped, he'd become a butterfly.

261
00:10:44,555 --> 00:10:45,320
(knocking on door)

262
00:10:45,322 --> 00:10:47,589
Oh.

263
00:10:47,591 --> 00:10:50,459
Maybe someone's here
to apologize.

264
00:10:51,295 --> 00:10:52,995
Hey, Leonard.

265
00:10:54,498 --> 00:10:55,998
Stuart.

266
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,066
Uh...

267
00:10:59,803 --> 00:11:02,571
Is this not a dress-up party?

268
00:11:02,573 --> 00:11:04,339
No.

269
00:11:07,011 --> 00:11:09,311
Was it ever a dress-up party?

270
00:11:09,313 --> 00:11:11,713
No.

271
00:11:11,715 --> 00:11:14,950
Howard, didn't you tell me
it was a dress-up party?

272
00:11:14,952 --> 00:11:17,486
Yeah. (chuckles)

273
00:11:20,024 --> 00:11:22,124
(knocking on door)

274
00:11:27,297 --> 00:11:30,999
I was told this is where to go
if I'm mad at Howard.

275
00:11:32,870 --> 00:11:36,571
May I take your cloak?

276
00:11:36,573 --> 00:11:38,206
Thanks.

277
00:11:38,208 --> 00:11:42,044
This thing kept getting caught
in the chain of my bike.

278
00:11:42,046 --> 00:11:44,379
Well, I'll catch you up.

279
00:11:44,381 --> 00:11:47,382
Uh, Penny is angry at Leonard,
Leonard's angry at me and Penny,

280
00:11:47,384 --> 00:11:49,051
I'm angry at Leonard and Amy,

281
00:11:49,053 --> 00:11:50,619
Raj is angry at Howard,

282
00:11:50,621 --> 00:11:52,821
and I'm angry
at George R.R. Martin

283
00:11:52,823 --> 00:11:55,624
'cause there are no new books
for me to spoil for Leonard.

284
00:11:55,626 --> 00:11:59,394
So what happened
with you and Howard?

285
00:11:59,396 --> 00:12:00,896
Says I was talking too much

286
00:12:00,898 --> 00:12:02,230
about dating Claire and Emily,

287
00:12:02,232 --> 00:12:04,666
and I accused him
of being jealous.

288
00:12:04,668 --> 00:12:06,134
I'm jealous.

289
00:12:06,136 --> 00:12:07,736
Closest I've come
to dating two women

290
00:12:07,738 --> 00:12:10,338
was that time I dated one woman.

291
00:12:14,211 --> 00:12:16,445
I don't know how
<i>you</i> put up with it.

292
00:12:16,447 --> 00:12:18,447
He's impossible.
I mean, holding a meeting

293
00:12:18,449 --> 00:12:21,283
to decide what
breakfast cereal we should buy.

294
00:12:21,285 --> 00:12:24,986
Yeah. Cap'n Crunch
with Crunch Berries, move on.

295
00:12:24,988 --> 00:12:28,890
Anyway, Amy, thank you
for sticking up for me.

296
00:12:28,892 --> 00:12:32,260
Oh, I honestly
couldn't care less.

297
00:12:32,262 --> 00:12:33,995
Sorry?

298
00:12:33,997 --> 00:12:36,298
Well, I just took your side
'cause sometimes I get annoyed

299
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:37,866
at how close Sheldon
and Penny are.

300
00:12:37,868 --> 00:12:40,869
Well, they argue all the time.

301
00:12:40,871 --> 00:12:42,104
They aren't that close.

302
00:12:42,106 --> 00:12:44,272
Who's always comforting
him when he's upset?

303
00:12:44,274 --> 00:12:46,441
Penny, but...
Who's the only one

304
00:12:46,443 --> 00:12:48,210
who can make him take his
medicine when he's sick?

305
00:12:48,212 --> 00:12:50,178
I try to hide it
in his peanut butter,

306
00:12:50,180 --> 00:12:52,047
but he spits it out.

307
00:12:53,851 --> 00:12:54,850
Okay.

308
00:12:54,852 --> 00:12:56,752
And did you know she
has him add things

309
00:12:56,754 --> 00:12:58,987
to the Roommate Agreement
so she can get her way

310
00:12:58,989 --> 00:13:00,989
and not fight
with you about it?

311
00:13:00,991 --> 00:13:03,258
Son of a bitch.

312
00:13:05,095 --> 00:13:07,229
(laughs)

313
00:13:07,231 --> 00:13:10,265
Why is that funny?

314
00:13:10,267 --> 00:13:12,300
I don't know.
I like the pain of others.

315
00:13:12,302 --> 00:13:14,069
(laughs)

316
00:13:14,071 --> 00:13:16,671
Oh, well,
then you'll enjoy this.

317
00:13:16,673 --> 00:13:19,608
Bernadette does the same thing
with you and Koothrappali.

318
00:13:19,610 --> 00:13:20,575
No, she doesn't.

319
00:13:20,577 --> 00:13:22,477
She defends him all the time.

320
00:13:22,479 --> 00:13:23,779
She does not.

321
00:13:23,781 --> 00:13:25,080
Who told you
to stop making

322
00:13:25,082 --> 00:13:27,215
all those Gandhi
jokes about him?

323
00:13:27,217 --> 00:13:29,885
Well, she did.

324
00:13:29,887 --> 00:13:32,454
And human resources.

325
00:13:34,291 --> 00:13:36,258
Who do you think
told Koothrappali

326
00:13:36,260 --> 00:13:38,126
to go to human resources?

327
00:13:39,029 --> 00:13:41,930
Son of a bitch.

328
00:13:41,932 --> 00:13:43,799
(laughs)

329
00:13:43,801 --> 00:13:46,668
You're right, it feels good.

330
00:13:48,372 --> 00:13:51,840
All right,
it's almost game time.

331
00:13:51,842 --> 00:13:52,808
Get it?

332
00:13:52,810 --> 00:13:55,610
<i>Game of Thrones,</i> game time?

333
00:13:57,447 --> 00:13:59,681
Two women, huh?

334
00:14:00,884 --> 00:14:03,218
<i>(Game of Thrones</i> theme
playing on TV, knocking on door)

335
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:05,153
Oh, perhaps it's Amy
coming to her senses.

336
00:14:05,155 --> 00:14:06,655
(music stops)

337
00:14:06,657 --> 00:14:08,557
What's up?
You know,

338
00:14:08,559 --> 00:14:10,592
you don't need to use Sheldon
to get your way with me

339
00:14:10,594 --> 00:14:11,827
in a dumb
Roommate Agreement.

340
00:14:11,829 --> 00:14:12,761
Where'd you get that from?

341
00:14:12,763 --> 00:14:13,695
From Amy.

342
00:14:13,697 --> 00:14:16,264
Ugh. Amy, why did you
tell him that?

343
00:14:16,266 --> 00:14:19,434
Because you were defending
Sheldon like you always do.

344
00:14:19,436 --> 00:14:20,769
I don't always
defend Sheldon.

345
00:14:20,771 --> 00:14:22,771
Oh, yes, you do.
You know you have a weird

346
00:14:22,773 --> 00:14:25,774
brother-sister-Elliott-E.T.
relationship with him.

347
00:14:25,776 --> 00:14:28,710
What about your weird
relationship with him?

348
00:14:28,712 --> 00:14:29,744
That's different.

349
00:14:29,746 --> 00:14:31,213
I'm like the little girl
in <i>Poltergeist</i>

350
00:14:31,215 --> 00:14:33,248
and he's the creepy thing
in the TV.

351
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:35,884
WOLOWITZ:
Um, guys?

352
00:14:35,886 --> 00:14:38,186
Were there any nuts
in that food?

353
00:14:38,188 --> 00:14:40,188
I don't think so. Why?
Well...

354
00:14:40,190 --> 00:14:42,991
just a feeling. (chuckles)

355
00:14:52,536 --> 00:14:54,436
It just said
"Italian sub."

356
00:14:54,438 --> 00:14:57,505
I had no idea mortadella
has pistachios in it.

357
00:14:57,507 --> 00:14:59,774
Interesting fact:

358
00:14:59,776 --> 00:15:04,246
In Italian, the "morta"
in "mortadella" means death.

359
00:15:05,849 --> 00:15:07,749
Sheldon.

360
00:15:07,751 --> 00:15:11,519
I didn't say "fun" fact.
I'm not a monster.

361
00:15:11,521 --> 00:15:13,488
He's gonna be okay.

362
00:15:13,490 --> 00:15:14,356
(all sighing)

363
00:15:14,358 --> 00:15:17,158
Now it's a fun fact.

364
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:20,595
Boy, stuff like this really
puts things in perspective.

365
00:15:20,597 --> 00:15:22,297
Why are you
dressed like that?

366
00:15:22,299 --> 00:15:25,200
Oh, uh, Howard thought
it'd be funny

367
00:15:25,202 --> 00:15:27,235
to tell me
it was a costume party.

368
00:15:27,237 --> 00:15:28,770
That wasn't nice.

369
00:15:28,772 --> 00:15:32,607
No, but he almost died,
so we're cool.

370
00:15:33,944 --> 00:15:37,178
You know, if you think about it,
tonight was kind of like

371
00:15:37,180 --> 00:15:39,281
a real-life
<i>Game of Thrones.</i>

372
00:15:39,283 --> 00:15:40,282
How?

373
00:15:40,284 --> 00:15:42,617
Well, Howard eating
that pistachio

374
00:15:42,619 --> 00:15:44,786
was like when King
Joffrey got poisoned.

375
00:15:44,788 --> 00:15:47,222
Okay, well, that was murder,
this was an accident.

376
00:15:47,224 --> 00:15:48,189
Okay.

377
00:15:48,191 --> 00:15:50,525
But you using Sheldon

378
00:15:50,527 --> 00:15:53,561
to do your dirty work
is like when Cersei

379
00:15:53,563 --> 00:15:55,297
used the King's Guard
to do her bidding.

380
00:15:55,299 --> 00:15:58,600
Cersei uses her body
to manipulate men.

381
00:15:58,602 --> 00:16:01,369
Penny just takes me
to The LEGO Store.

382
00:16:01,371 --> 00:16:04,806
Okay. Oh, how about this?

383
00:16:04,808 --> 00:16:07,642
Stuart's dressed like a
brother of the Night's Watch,

384
00:16:07,644 --> 00:16:09,477
and they don't have sex.

385
00:16:09,479 --> 00:16:10,478
There you go.
That's true.

386
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:11,713
Fair enough.

387
00:16:12,950 --> 00:16:14,110
Hey.

388
00:16:14,111 --> 00:16:15,315
Hey.
You all right?

389
00:16:15,316 --> 00:16:16,849
I'm fine.

390
00:16:16,851 --> 00:16:19,384
Just a little embarrassed I had
to be carried down the stairs

391
00:16:19,386 --> 00:16:20,452
like a baby.

392
00:16:20,454 --> 00:16:21,987
Thanks.

393
00:16:23,824 --> 00:16:25,624
Let's get out of here.

394
00:16:25,626 --> 00:16:27,159
That was scary.

395
00:16:27,161 --> 00:16:28,560
Well, the
important thing is

396
00:16:28,562 --> 00:16:30,596
I said that big sandwich
would ruin everything,

397
00:16:30,598 --> 00:16:32,431
and I was right.

398
00:16:35,269 --> 00:16:38,370
KOOTHRAPPALI:
Hey, Jon Snow!

399
00:16:38,372 --> 00:16:41,607
How come your horse
has a basket on it?

400
00:16:43,377 --> 00:16:46,845
How come your head
has your face on it?

401
00:16:48,916 --> 00:16:51,517
They don't wear bicycle helmets
in <i>Game of Thrones.</i>

402
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:53,585
You're thematically inaccurate,

403
00:16:53,587 --> 00:16:57,289
but I applaud
your commitment to safety.

404
00:16:57,291 --> 00:17:00,325
Don't you guys have anything
better to do?

405
00:17:00,327 --> 00:17:02,694
Better than watching
a guy in a fur cloak

406
00:17:02,696 --> 00:17:06,064
ride a girl's
bike? Nope.

407
00:17:06,066 --> 00:17:09,768
That's it, you just lost
bathroom privileges

408
00:17:09,770 --> 00:17:12,371
at the comic book store.

409
00:17:17,344 --> 00:17:19,411
(muttering): Horse has
a basket on it. Stupid...

410
00:17:20,247 --> 00:17:22,447
(screams, grunts)

411
00:17:32,279 --> 00:17:34,346
(knocks)
SHELDON: Leonard.

412
00:17:34,348 --> 00:17:37,482
(knocks) Leonard.
(knocks) Leonard.

413
00:17:37,484 --> 00:17:39,284
What?

414
00:17:39,286 --> 00:17:42,220
I never got to ask
my question about Batman.

415
00:17:44,991 --> 00:17:46,124
What is it?

416
00:17:46,126 --> 00:17:49,661
If Batman were bitten
by a radioactive Man-Bat,

417
00:17:49,663 --> 00:17:53,365
and then fought crime
disguised as Man-Bat,

418
00:17:53,367 --> 00:17:56,501
would he be
Man-Bat-Man-Bat-Man

419
00:17:56,503 --> 00:18:00,171
or simply
Man-Bat-Man-Bat-Batman?

420
00:18:02,576 --> 00:18:06,845
Is he still wearing the Batman
suit under the Man-Bat suit?

421
00:18:09,148 --> 00:18:10,814
I'll be back.
