00:00:00,473 --> 00:00:02,174
<i>Previously on</i>
The Big Bang Theory...

2
00:00:02,896 --> 00:00:04,830
Well, there was this girl.

3
00:00:05,198 --> 00:00:07,132
What did you do?

4
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:08,133
Nothing.

5
00:00:08,201 --> 00:00:11,102
Really, it was just kissing.

6
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:15,940
All right.

7
00:00:16,008 --> 00:00:18,243
So, we're still
getting married?

8
00:00:20,112 --> 00:00:21,279
Yes.

9
00:00:22,581 --> 00:00:24,549
Because we love each other.

10
00:00:24,616 --> 00:00:26,217
Yes.

11
00:00:26,285 --> 00:00:29,654
And it's the happiest day
of our life.

12
00:00:29,722 --> 00:00:31,022
Don't push it.

13
00:00:33,759 --> 00:00:35,927
I need some time
to take a step back

14
00:00:35,995 --> 00:00:39,164
and reevaluate our situation.

15
00:00:40,199 --> 00:00:41,800
Oh.

16
00:00:41,867 --> 00:00:43,902
Bye, Sheldon.

17
00:00:46,338 --> 00:00:48,339
Well, Gollum...

18
00:00:50,475 --> 00:00:53,677
...you're an expert on rings.

19
00:00:53,745 --> 00:00:56,046
What do I do with this one?

20
00:00:59,184 --> 00:01:01,251
So, what package
are you thinking?

21
00:01:01,319 --> 00:01:03,253
Mm, this one comes with
music and flowers.

22
00:01:03,321 --> 00:01:06,690
Oh, they even stream the whole
thing live on the Internet.

23
00:01:06,758 --> 00:01:08,125
Why would we want that?

24
00:01:08,193 --> 00:01:10,527
'Cause there's a lot
of gorgeous blondes out there

25
00:01:10,595 --> 00:01:13,296
who don't believe they can land
a short, nearsighted scientist.

26
00:01:13,364 --> 00:01:15,832
Let's give them hope.

27
00:01:15,899 --> 00:01:17,466
Whatever. Put us
on the Internet.

28
00:01:17,534 --> 00:01:20,369
I've always wanted a wedding
with a comment section.

29
00:01:20,437 --> 00:01:24,673
I-If you're not into this,
we can do it another time.

30
00:01:24,742 --> 00:01:26,042
No. No, I want to.

31
00:01:26,110 --> 00:01:28,211
Look, we've put this
off long enough.

32
00:01:28,278 --> 00:01:29,712
Let's do it.
Aw.

33
00:01:29,780 --> 00:01:32,915
That's exactly what you said the
first time we slept together.

34
00:01:34,484 --> 00:01:36,318
Oh, excuse me.

35
00:01:36,386 --> 00:01:37,553
Sheldon.

36
00:01:37,621 --> 00:01:38,754
Hey.

37
00:01:38,821 --> 00:01:40,688
Leonard, have you
gotten married yet?

38
00:01:40,757 --> 00:01:41,857
No. Why?

39
00:01:41,924 --> 00:01:43,591
Good. Don't do it!
Why not?

40
00:01:43,659 --> 00:01:45,927
Some important new information
has come to light.

41
00:01:45,995 --> 00:01:48,930
Women are the worst.

42
00:01:48,998 --> 00:01:50,832
I thought it was paper cuts,
but I was wrong.

43
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:53,701
No piece of paper
ever cut me this deep.

44
00:01:53,770 --> 00:01:55,470
What happened now?

45
00:01:55,537 --> 00:01:58,907
Amy has ended our relationship.

46
00:01:58,975 --> 00:02:00,242
Oh, no. Seriously?

47
00:02:00,309 --> 00:02:01,009
What's going on?

48
00:02:01,077 --> 00:02:02,510
Amy broke up with Sheldon.

49
00:02:02,578 --> 00:02:03,744
She did?

50
00:02:03,812 --> 00:02:06,213
Is Penny crying?

51
00:02:06,281 --> 00:02:07,281
No.

52
00:02:07,315 --> 00:02:08,082
No, of course not.

53
00:02:08,150 --> 00:02:10,751
They thrive on our suffering.

54
00:02:10,819 --> 00:02:12,552
Buddy, I-I'm so sorry.

55
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:14,554
Is there anything I can do?

56
00:02:14,622 --> 00:02:15,990
Yes. If I ever talk about

57
00:02:16,057 --> 00:02:18,259
going out with a girl again,
roll your eyes at me

58
00:02:18,326 --> 00:02:21,395
like I do to you
when you say dumb things.

59
00:02:21,462 --> 00:02:22,897
Sheldon, uh, o-okay,
just because

60
00:02:22,964 --> 00:02:24,364
you're going through this
with Amy

61
00:02:24,432 --> 00:02:26,400
doesn't mean
that all women are bad.

62
00:02:26,467 --> 00:02:28,769
Whatever.

63
00:02:28,836 --> 00:02:30,136
Hey, I just heard

64
00:02:30,204 --> 00:02:31,772
about you and Sheldon.
Are you okay?

65
00:02:31,839 --> 00:02:32,939
Not really.

66
00:02:33,007 --> 00:02:34,441
Can you come over?

67
00:02:34,509 --> 00:02:36,042
Uh, actually I'm in Vegas.

68
00:02:36,110 --> 00:02:38,244
Leonard and I
are about to get married.

69
00:02:38,313 --> 00:02:39,546
Hold on.

70
00:02:39,614 --> 00:02:42,015
You're getting married
and you didn't invite me?

71
00:02:42,082 --> 00:02:44,651
Well, it was kind of
a spur-of-the-moment thing.

72
00:02:44,719 --> 00:02:46,052
Wow.

73
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:49,856
Hope I can catch
the bouquet from here.

74
00:02:49,924 --> 00:02:51,725
Amy, don't be like that.

75
00:02:51,793 --> 00:02:53,727
Why did I just hear Amy's name?

76
00:02:53,795 --> 00:02:54,894
Penny's on the phone
with her.

77
00:02:54,962 --> 00:02:56,095
Did she say anything about me?

78
00:02:56,163 --> 00:02:57,630
Never mind. I don't care.

79
00:02:57,698 --> 00:02:59,498
Well, if you care,
you can find out and tell me.

80
00:02:59,566 --> 00:03:02,635
Just don't be shocked when
you find out that I don't care.

81
00:03:02,703 --> 00:03:03,769
Okay, will you relax?

82
00:03:03,838 --> 00:03:05,939
You're not missing
anything special.

83
00:03:06,807 --> 00:03:08,574
Hey.

84
00:03:08,642 --> 00:03:09,642
She's upset.

85
00:03:09,676 --> 00:03:11,077
Look, it's gonna be
a great wedding.

86
00:03:11,145 --> 00:03:13,947
Look at you in
your little suit.

87
00:03:14,014 --> 00:03:15,715
Amy's upset? Is it about me?

88
00:03:15,782 --> 00:03:17,250
No, I think it's because
we're eloping.

89
00:03:17,318 --> 00:03:19,552
Your marriage
is causing her pain?

90
00:03:19,619 --> 00:03:20,853
Yeah, great, I take it back.

91
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:23,356
Go ahead and do it.
Yay for love!

92
00:03:23,423 --> 00:03:26,892
? Our whole universe
was in a hot, dense state ?

93
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:30,262
? Then nearly 14 billion years
ago expansion started... Wait! ?

94
00:03:30,330 --> 00:03:31,831
? The Earth began to cool

95
00:03:31,898 --> 00:03:34,567
? The autotrophs began to drool,
Neanderthals developed tools ?

96
00:03:34,634 --> 00:03:37,202
? We built the Wall
? <i>We built the pyramids</i> ?

97
00:03:37,270 --> 00:03:39,937
? Math, Science, History,
unraveling the mystery ?

98
00:03:40,005 --> 00:03:41,840
? That all started
with a big bang ?

99
00:03:41,907 --> 00:03:43,308
? <i>Bang!</i> ?

102
00:03:53,913 --> 00:03:56,215
Hello.
Oh!

103
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:58,287
What are you doing here?

104
00:03:58,355 --> 00:04:01,657
When last we spoke,
you said you needed time.

105
00:04:01,725 --> 00:04:05,093
Well, it's only been 11 hours.

106
00:04:05,161 --> 00:04:07,730
<i>The Lord of the Rings</i> trilogy
was nearly 11 hours.

107
00:04:07,797 --> 00:04:10,266
I made you watch that,
you said it was an eternity.

108
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:14,536
Sheldon, when I'm ready to talk,
I'll let you know.

109
00:04:14,604 --> 00:04:16,004
Very well.

110
00:04:16,072 --> 00:04:17,839
You seem to be
headed somewhere.

111
00:04:17,907 --> 00:04:19,575
May I walk with you?

112
00:04:19,643 --> 00:04:21,644
Sure.

113
00:04:23,513 --> 00:04:26,148
Boy, I'm glad we're
going out again.

114
00:04:28,184 --> 00:04:29,385
We're not back together.

115
00:04:29,452 --> 00:04:30,452
Why?

116
00:04:30,487 --> 00:04:31,620
Is there someone else?

117
00:04:31,688 --> 00:04:32,988
Just couldn't wait
for that first notch

118
00:04:33,055 --> 00:04:34,689
on your bedpost, could you?

119
00:04:34,757 --> 00:04:36,691
If you must know,

120
00:04:36,759 --> 00:04:38,193
I'm going to Howard
and Bernadette's

121
00:04:38,261 --> 00:04:39,627
to watch the wedding.

122
00:04:39,695 --> 00:04:40,728
And who's this guy
you're taking?

123
00:04:40,797 --> 00:04:41,830
There's no guy!

124
00:04:41,898 --> 00:04:43,331
Oh, you're going
to a wedding alone?

125
00:04:43,399 --> 00:04:45,100
That's sad.

126
00:04:45,168 --> 00:04:46,334
I'm not gonna be alone.

127
00:04:46,402 --> 00:04:47,669
I'll be with my friends.

128
00:04:47,736 --> 00:04:48,870
<i>Your</i> friends?

129
00:04:48,938 --> 00:04:50,471
Well, I think you mean
<i>my</i> friends.

130
00:04:50,539 --> 00:04:52,207
And why wasn't
I invited to this?

131
00:04:52,275 --> 00:04:54,342
Maybe because the two of us
being there

132
00:04:54,410 --> 00:04:56,611
would make them feel awkward.

133
00:04:56,679 --> 00:04:58,513
We make everyone
feel awkward.

134
00:04:58,580 --> 00:05:00,849
That's our thing!

135
00:05:01,984 --> 00:05:03,351
They're running
a little behind.

136
00:05:03,419 --> 00:05:04,952
Should be pretty soon.
Okay.

137
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:07,622
Hey, if you're hungry,
there's a breakfast buffet

138
00:05:07,690 --> 00:05:09,824
at the strip club next door.

139
00:05:09,891 --> 00:05:14,128
Thanks, but I don't like glitter
on my scrambled eggs.

140
00:05:14,196 --> 00:05:18,199
I don't think the strippers
prepare the meal, but okay.

141
00:05:19,601 --> 00:05:22,837
Look, it-it's not
how I pictured it either,

142
00:05:22,904 --> 00:05:24,472
but I'm still glad
we're doing it.

143
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:26,374
Me, too.
You sure?

144
00:05:26,442 --> 00:05:27,842
Yes.
And you promise

145
00:05:27,909 --> 00:05:29,844
you're okay with
everything from the car?

146
00:05:29,911 --> 00:05:31,611
Oh, my God, would you stop
bringing it up?

147
00:05:31,679 --> 00:05:33,513
You're right.
I'm sorry.

148
00:05:33,581 --> 00:05:35,015
We have the rest of our lives

149
00:05:35,083 --> 00:05:38,319
to dredge stuff up from the past
and fight about it.

150
00:05:39,587 --> 00:05:40,687
So what do you think?

151
00:05:40,755 --> 00:05:42,589
Should we run next door
and grab a bite?

152
00:05:42,657 --> 00:05:44,124
What if they call our names?

153
00:05:44,192 --> 00:05:47,694
Oh, don't worry. They gave me
this vibrating coaster.

154
00:05:47,762 --> 00:05:51,130
Oh, and the fairy tale
continues.

155
00:05:53,601 --> 00:05:55,569
Thank you for doing this.

156
00:05:55,636 --> 00:05:56,737
Our pleasure.

157
00:05:56,804 --> 00:05:58,004
You feeling okay?

158
00:05:58,072 --> 00:06:00,073
We were together for so long,

159
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:02,509
I honestly don't know
what I'm feeling.

160
00:06:02,577 --> 00:06:04,644
Well, that's
understandable.

161
00:06:04,712 --> 00:06:07,180
You forgot.
It's called "happy."

162
00:06:07,248 --> 00:06:08,615
Howard.

163
00:06:08,683 --> 00:06:09,716
I'm not saying
anything bad.

164
00:06:09,784 --> 00:06:11,885
Just that she was in love
with her captor

165
00:06:11,952 --> 00:06:15,221
and somehow managed to escape
from his dark and crazy dungeon.

166
00:06:16,891 --> 00:06:18,057
I know
what you're going through.

167
00:06:18,125 --> 00:06:20,526
My-my last breakup
was pretty tough.

168
00:06:20,594 --> 00:06:22,795
Oh. What was her name?

169
00:06:22,863 --> 00:06:23,963
Hey, it's a true story.

170
00:06:24,031 --> 00:06:26,065
I don't need the third degree.

171
00:06:31,038 --> 00:06:33,839
For God's sake, Sheldon,
what are you doing?

172
00:06:33,908 --> 00:06:35,440
I didn't want
to come in.

173
00:06:35,508 --> 00:06:38,610
I was told it would make
everyone feel uncomfortable.

174
00:06:39,379 --> 00:06:40,578
So I'll just stay out here

175
00:06:40,646 --> 00:06:42,948
and pretend that I don't
have to go to the bathroom.

176
00:06:46,152 --> 00:06:47,886
Howard, do something.

177
00:06:47,954 --> 00:06:49,988
I'm on it.

178
00:06:56,963 --> 00:07:00,631
Sheldon, you being here might
not be making things better.

179
00:07:00,698 --> 00:07:02,599
I see.

180
00:07:02,667 --> 00:07:05,202
And is that why
everybody was invited but me?

181
00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:07,204
They didn't invite
everybody but you.

182
00:07:07,272 --> 00:07:08,772
Bernadette invited me,

183
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:10,074
and Stuart lives here.

184
00:07:10,142 --> 00:07:12,843
Who wants hot cinnamon rolls?

185
00:07:15,747 --> 00:07:18,649
So, when you hear the music,
that's your cue.

186
00:07:18,716 --> 00:07:19,951
Any questions?

187
00:07:20,018 --> 00:07:21,919
Oh, the package
that we paid for

188
00:07:21,986 --> 00:07:24,520
said the aisle was supposed
to be strewn with rose petals.

189
00:07:24,588 --> 00:07:25,888
Where are the rose petals?!

190
00:07:25,957 --> 00:07:27,991
We're out!
You know what?

191
00:07:28,059 --> 00:07:29,259
It's fine.

192
00:07:29,327 --> 00:07:31,727
We can use the
potpourri from the bathroom!

193
00:07:31,795 --> 00:07:33,430
Really, we're good.

194
00:07:33,497 --> 00:07:35,065
Yup, just want
to get married.

195
00:07:35,132 --> 00:07:36,266
Yeah.
Great.

196
00:07:36,334 --> 00:07:38,301
I'll see you two
up there.

197
00:07:40,804 --> 00:07:43,306
This is it.
I know.

198
00:07:43,374 --> 00:07:46,108
I love you.

199
00:07:46,176 --> 00:07:48,077
I love you, too.

200
00:07:48,144 --> 00:07:50,580
Was that a yes
or no on the potpourri?!

201
00:07:50,647 --> 00:07:52,715
No, thank you!
We're good!

202
00:07:55,853 --> 00:07:57,386
Raj, you're probably wondering

203
00:07:57,454 --> 00:08:00,957
why Amy and I aren't showing
any affection to one another.

204
00:08:01,024 --> 00:08:03,192
Didn't even crack the top ten.

205
00:08:05,261 --> 00:08:06,295
Well, you should know

206
00:08:06,363 --> 00:08:07,930
that she recently
broke up with me.

207
00:08:07,998 --> 00:08:10,799
I said I needed
time to think.

208
00:08:10,867 --> 00:08:13,135
I'm sure you guys
will figure something out.

209
00:08:13,203 --> 00:08:15,904
You hear that?
Raj is devastated.

210
00:08:15,972 --> 00:08:18,673
Sheldon, shh.
The wedding's starting.

211
00:08:18,741 --> 00:08:20,309
I see what's happening.

212
00:08:20,377 --> 00:08:21,643
Sides are forming.

213
00:08:21,711 --> 00:08:23,812
Well, if Bernadette's
on Amy's team, I pick Howard.

214
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:24,913
I'm not taking sides.

215
00:08:24,981 --> 00:08:26,382
Fine, I guess
I'm stuck with Raj.

216
00:08:26,449 --> 00:08:27,716
Really?

217
00:08:27,783 --> 00:08:30,519
At least you
got picked.

218
00:08:32,255 --> 00:08:33,322
Before I go any further,

219
00:08:33,390 --> 00:08:35,289
have either of you
prepared your own vows?

220
00:08:35,357 --> 00:08:36,790
Yes.
No.

221
00:08:37,493 --> 00:08:39,527
You wrote vows?

222
00:08:39,594 --> 00:08:40,594
Yeah.

223
00:08:40,629 --> 00:08:42,330
Well, I don't have any.

224
00:08:42,398 --> 00:08:45,066
You're kind of
making me look bad.

225
00:08:45,134 --> 00:08:47,601
It's okay. I-I don't
have to say them.

226
00:08:47,669 --> 00:08:48,969
No, no, no, go ahead.

227
00:08:49,038 --> 00:08:52,940
I'll come up with something
mushy, you'll cry, we got this.

228
00:08:53,008 --> 00:08:55,743
"Penny, we are
made of particles

229
00:08:55,810 --> 00:08:58,111
"that have existed since the
moment the universe began.

230
00:08:58,179 --> 00:09:00,947
"I like to think
those atoms traveled

231
00:09:01,015 --> 00:09:04,017
"14 billion years through
time and space to create us,

232
00:09:04,085 --> 00:09:08,021
so that we could be together
and make each other whole."

233
00:09:08,089 --> 00:09:10,524
Wow.

234
00:09:11,526 --> 00:09:13,260
Penny?

235
00:09:13,327 --> 00:09:17,030
Right. Um... okay.

236
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:22,936
Leonard, I mean, you're not
only the love of my life.

237
00:09:23,003 --> 00:09:25,204
I mean,
you're my best friend, and...

238
00:09:27,307 --> 00:09:30,242
...you've got a friend in me.

239
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:34,948
You got troubles.

240
00:09:35,015 --> 00:09:36,816
I got 'em, too.

241
00:09:38,251 --> 00:09:41,988
There isn't anything
I wouldn't do for you.

242
00:09:42,056 --> 00:09:45,558
We stick together,
and we can see it through,

243
00:09:45,625 --> 00:09:48,927
'cause... you've got
a friend in me.

244
00:09:50,930 --> 00:09:52,731
Is that the song
from <i>Toy Story?</i>

245
00:09:52,799 --> 00:09:53,799
He loves that movie.

246
00:09:53,866 --> 00:09:55,301
I do.

247
00:09:57,571 --> 00:10:00,272
Aw, that was beautiful.
Yeah.

248
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:02,208
I mean, not like our
wedding beautiful.

249
00:10:02,275 --> 00:10:04,910
No, we totally won.

250
00:10:04,978 --> 00:10:07,778
Amy, I don't understand,
are we broken up or not?

251
00:10:07,846 --> 00:10:09,380
It's like you can't
make up your mind.

252
00:10:09,448 --> 00:10:12,450
It's because you're not
giving me any space to think.

253
00:10:12,518 --> 00:10:13,751
Well, you should think fast,

254
00:10:13,819 --> 00:10:16,221
because men can sire offspring
their entire lives,

255
00:10:16,288 --> 00:10:19,357
but those eggs you're toting
around have a sell-by date.

256
00:10:23,129 --> 00:10:25,896
You know what, Sheldon,
you've made this really easy.

257
00:10:25,964 --> 00:10:29,267
You're immature, you're selfish,
you just insulted me to my face.

258
00:10:29,335 --> 00:10:31,636
I don't need any more time
to think. We're broken up.

259
00:10:31,703 --> 00:10:32,870
Amy...

260
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:36,741
Will someone take me home?

261
00:10:36,808 --> 00:10:37,842
Yeah. Come on,
I'll give you a ride.

262
00:10:37,909 --> 00:10:40,611
...symbolizes your eternal love.

263
00:10:40,679 --> 00:10:44,248
I now pronounce you
husband and wife.

264
00:10:46,217 --> 00:10:47,051
We did it!

265
00:10:47,119 --> 00:10:50,755
I'm so glad
you guys could watch!

266
00:10:50,822 --> 00:10:54,324
We'll say it was beautiful
in the comment section.

267
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:02,074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

268
00:11:04,923 --> 00:11:06,656
No, no, no. Hang on.

269
00:11:06,724 --> 00:11:09,926
I believe I'm supposed to
carry you across the threshold.

270
00:11:09,994 --> 00:11:12,461
Can you?

271
00:11:12,530 --> 00:11:14,230
Who do you think
carries Sheldon to bed

272
00:11:14,297 --> 00:11:16,765
when he falls asleep
in front of the TV?

273
00:11:16,833 --> 00:11:18,567
Okay, let's do it.

274
00:11:27,577 --> 00:11:29,778
You gonna make it?
I'm okay!

275
00:11:32,449 --> 00:11:34,550
Nicely done!

276
00:11:34,617 --> 00:11:35,951
Thank you.

277
00:11:36,019 --> 00:11:37,085
Finally, there's
a Mrs. Hofstadter

278
00:11:37,153 --> 00:11:39,654
who isn't disappointed in me.

279
00:11:39,721 --> 00:11:41,722
Well, the night is still young.

280
00:11:53,802 --> 00:11:55,603
Everything all right?

281
00:11:56,638 --> 00:11:58,906
Yeah. I guess.

282
00:11:58,974 --> 00:12:01,709
Just tell me.

283
00:12:02,678 --> 00:12:03,844
It's just, when we were kissing,

284
00:12:03,912 --> 00:12:06,280
I couldn't help but picture
you with that other girl.

285
00:12:06,347 --> 00:12:07,281
Oh, no.

286
00:12:07,348 --> 00:12:08,583
No, come on.

287
00:12:08,650 --> 00:12:09,884
I have a friend in you.

288
00:12:09,952 --> 00:12:12,119
You said so.

289
00:12:12,187 --> 00:12:13,854
You're right.
Just forget it.

290
00:12:13,922 --> 00:12:15,890
Yeah.

291
00:12:19,661 --> 00:12:22,096
Okay, listen. Uh...

292
00:12:22,163 --> 00:12:25,399
If you're imagining that
it was sexy, it wasn't.

293
00:12:25,467 --> 00:12:28,235
We-we were both drunk, and
she smelled like an ashtray.

294
00:12:28,303 --> 00:12:31,871
The boat was moving a lot,
so I chipped her tooth.

295
00:12:31,939 --> 00:12:33,974
Did you feel guilty?

296
00:12:34,041 --> 00:12:36,477
No, she had
dental insurance.

297
00:12:36,544 --> 00:12:40,714
Did you feel guilty
after kissing her?

298
00:12:40,781 --> 00:12:43,883
Yes. I felt guilty as
soon as it happened.

299
00:12:43,951 --> 00:12:47,020
I feel guilty
every time I see her.

300
00:12:47,088 --> 00:12:49,889
What do you mean,
every time you see her?

301
00:12:49,957 --> 00:12:51,891
What... do I mean?

302
00:12:51,959 --> 00:12:54,527
Boy, that's a toughie.

303
00:12:54,595 --> 00:12:57,130
You still see her?

304
00:12:57,197 --> 00:12:59,132
Well, no, not socially.

305
00:12:59,199 --> 00:13:00,366
But, you know,
just at work.

306
00:13:00,434 --> 00:13:02,869
You work with her?!

307
00:13:02,937 --> 00:13:04,437
How could you not tell me that?!

308
00:13:04,505 --> 00:13:06,973
I wanted to tell you in the car,
but you told me to stop talking!

309
00:13:07,041 --> 00:13:08,608
Oh, okay. So you're saying
this is my fault?

310
00:13:08,676 --> 00:13:10,110
No, of course not.

311
00:13:10,177 --> 00:13:11,745
Okay, l-look,

312
00:13:11,812 --> 00:13:13,146
instead of fighting,

313
00:13:13,213 --> 00:13:15,715
why don't we dim the lights,

314
00:13:15,783 --> 00:13:19,618
um, get naked and make a baby?

315
00:13:26,126 --> 00:13:28,994
I was trying
to lighten the mood.

316
00:13:29,062 --> 00:13:32,330
It's not easy. You try it.

317
00:13:33,599 --> 00:13:34,667
Hello, Mother.

318
00:13:34,734 --> 00:13:36,935
Shelly! How's my baby doing?

319
00:13:37,003 --> 00:13:38,403
I just wanted to let you know

320
00:13:38,471 --> 00:13:41,406
that you can remove Amy
from your nightly prayers.

321
00:13:41,474 --> 00:13:43,208
Unless you're open
to praying for

322
00:13:43,276 --> 00:13:45,510
a beehive to fall on her head.

323
00:13:45,578 --> 00:13:47,712
Oh, what's going on?

324
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:49,013
She broke up with me.

325
00:13:49,081 --> 00:13:50,481
Oh, Shelly.

326
00:13:50,549 --> 00:13:51,282
No, I'll be okay.

327
00:13:51,349 --> 00:13:53,217
But I think that I'd like

328
00:13:53,285 --> 00:13:55,953
to send the ring back to you.

329
00:13:56,021 --> 00:13:57,121
Well, let's not be hasty.

330
00:13:57,189 --> 00:13:58,923
Are you sure it's over for good?

331
00:13:58,991 --> 00:14:01,125
It's over for me.
I'm done with women.

332
00:14:01,193 --> 00:14:03,061
Like when I swore off Pop Rocks.

333
00:14:03,128 --> 00:14:06,330
They both hurt you on purpose.

334
00:14:06,398 --> 00:14:08,399
You want to tell me
what happened?

335
00:14:08,466 --> 00:14:10,701
Are you going to say
it's all part of God's plan?

336
00:14:10,768 --> 00:14:11,601
Good chance.

337
00:14:11,669 --> 00:14:13,804
Then no, thank you.

338
00:14:13,871 --> 00:14:15,605
Well, honey,
don't send it back yet.

339
00:14:15,673 --> 00:14:17,833
Your sister's married,
and I'm not letting your brother

340
00:14:17,875 --> 00:14:21,511
give my grandmother's ring
to that whore he's dating.

341
00:14:21,579 --> 00:14:25,348
Wasn't Mary Magdalene
a woman of ill repute?

342
00:14:25,416 --> 00:14:28,051
When your idiot brother
redeems mankind,

343
00:14:28,119 --> 00:14:31,221
he can date whoever he wants.

344
00:14:33,624 --> 00:14:35,726
I know it hurts now,
but it's gonna get better.

345
00:14:35,793 --> 00:14:36,726
Yeah.

346
00:14:36,793 --> 00:14:38,094
Everything's gonna be okay.

347
00:14:38,161 --> 00:14:40,996
You've got so
much to offer.

348
00:14:41,064 --> 00:14:42,264
Thank you.

349
00:14:42,332 --> 00:14:44,600
Any man would be
lucky to have you.

350
00:14:44,667 --> 00:14:46,202
That's true.

351
00:14:46,269 --> 00:14:48,570
I just hope
I did the right thing.

352
00:14:48,638 --> 00:14:49,972
I'm sure you did.

353
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:53,142
Maybe that's the problem--
you always do the right thing.

354
00:14:53,210 --> 00:14:56,612
Maybe it's time to
do the wrong thing.

355
00:15:03,285 --> 00:15:06,420
Like you're doing right now?

356
00:15:08,323 --> 00:15:10,925
Exactly.

357
00:15:14,329 --> 00:15:16,631
I asked you over and
over if you were okay.

358
00:15:16,698 --> 00:15:18,938
Why would you go through with
the wedding if you weren't?

359
00:15:19,001 --> 00:15:22,036
I thought I was okay,
but it turns out I'm not.

360
00:15:22,104 --> 00:15:24,773
Okay, listen, I may not
have been entirely faithful,

361
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:27,308
but you,
you are not easy to lift!

362
00:15:32,147 --> 00:15:33,147
Wow!

363
00:15:33,214 --> 00:15:35,182
Well, marriage must agree
with you.

364
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:38,352
Well, you are just glowing.

365
00:15:41,790 --> 00:15:43,691
I'm not glowing.

366
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:45,293
I'm upset.

367
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:48,462
Well, whatever it is,
it agrees with you.

368
00:15:57,438 --> 00:16:00,274
Knock, knock,
knock, Penny?

369
00:16:00,341 --> 00:16:03,576
Knock, knock, knock, Penny?
Knock, knock, knock, Penny?

370
00:16:05,914 --> 00:16:07,014
What's this?

371
00:16:07,081 --> 00:16:08,282
Leonard told me what happened,

372
00:16:08,349 --> 00:16:11,151
so I took it upon myself
to make you a hot beverage.

373
00:16:11,219 --> 00:16:12,820
Oh. That's so sweet of you.

374
00:16:12,887 --> 00:16:14,421
Yeah. I know.

375
00:16:15,522 --> 00:16:16,889
Turns out, being sweet

376
00:16:16,957 --> 00:16:19,425
isn't enough
to keep a girl these days.

377
00:16:19,492 --> 00:16:21,493
I blame Madonna.

378
00:16:21,561 --> 00:16:24,496
I'm sorry to hear
about you and Amy.

379
00:16:24,564 --> 00:16:25,965
Well, I'm sorry
about Leonard.

380
00:16:26,033 --> 00:16:27,513
Thought I raised him
better than that.

381
00:16:27,567 --> 00:16:30,636
You know, it's bad enough
what happened,

382
00:16:30,704 --> 00:16:33,239
but then he tried to hide
the fact that he sees her

383
00:16:33,307 --> 00:16:35,174
all the time
at the university.

384
00:16:35,242 --> 00:16:37,576
He does? Who is it?

385
00:16:37,644 --> 00:16:39,911
Some girl named Mandy.

386
00:16:40,747 --> 00:16:43,081
Mandy Chao?
Yeah.

387
00:16:43,149 --> 00:16:44,817
Oh, you don't need
to worry about her.

388
00:16:44,884 --> 00:16:46,017
She's brilliant and attractive.

389
00:16:46,085 --> 00:16:48,520
She can do way better
than Leonard.

390
00:16:53,025 --> 00:16:54,560
That's great.

391
00:16:55,895 --> 00:16:57,262
Wait a minute.

392
00:16:57,330 --> 00:16:59,264
I know this may
sound farfetched,

393
00:16:59,332 --> 00:17:00,999
but I'm on the market now.

394
00:17:01,067 --> 00:17:02,800
You know, if I dated Mandy,

395
00:17:02,869 --> 00:17:05,770
that would teach both
Leonard and Amy a lesson.

396
00:17:05,838 --> 00:17:07,339
That's ridiculous.

397
00:17:07,406 --> 00:17:09,540
Oh, you're right.
I could never be with a woman

398
00:17:09,608 --> 00:17:12,344
whose self-esteem was so low
she'd be with Leonard.

399
00:17:12,411 --> 00:17:15,080
I'm with Leonard.

400
00:17:15,147 --> 00:17:17,548
Yeah, I know. Forever.

401
00:17:19,651 --> 00:17:22,587
Who would have believed
these things would happen to us?

402
00:17:22,654 --> 00:17:24,122
Right?

403
00:17:24,190 --> 00:17:27,125
I can't believe Amy
actually went through with it.

404
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:29,460
Hang on.

405
00:17:29,528 --> 00:17:32,096
You knew that she was
going to end it with me?

406
00:17:32,163 --> 00:17:33,864
Did you try
and stop her?

407
00:17:33,932 --> 00:17:38,102
I told her to be true to herself
and do what makes her happy.

408
00:17:38,169 --> 00:17:39,336
Do what makes her happy?

409
00:17:39,404 --> 00:17:41,906
She plays the harp and
her car is paid for.

410
00:17:41,973 --> 00:17:44,041
How much happier can she be?

411
00:17:44,876 --> 00:17:46,643
Okay, look, it's not my fault

412
00:17:46,711 --> 00:17:49,313
that she thought
you were a bad boyfriend.

413
00:17:50,382 --> 00:17:52,216
I see.

414
00:17:52,284 --> 00:17:54,285
Well...

415
00:17:58,188 --> 00:18:00,056
I think I'll be going.

416
00:18:00,958 --> 00:18:02,725
Sheldon...
No, no, no, no.

417
00:18:02,793 --> 00:18:05,128
We are done here.

418
00:18:08,432 --> 00:18:10,333
Would you mind
opening the door

419
00:18:10,401 --> 00:18:13,569
and then angrily slamming it
behind me?

420
00:18:14,504 --> 00:18:16,005
Sure.

421
00:18:16,073 --> 00:18:17,974
Thank you.

422
00:18:18,042 --> 00:18:19,675
And slam it hard,

423
00:18:19,743 --> 00:18:21,444
because I am pretty steamed.

424
00:18:24,047 --> 00:18:25,815
All right, Leonard,
hang in there.

425
00:18:25,882 --> 00:18:28,083
Talk to you tomorrow.

426
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:31,787
What happened?
They just got married.

427
00:18:31,855 --> 00:18:33,255
I don't know.

428
00:18:33,323 --> 00:18:36,625
It's a mess.
They had a huge fight in Vegas.

429
00:18:36,693 --> 00:18:37,860
Think they'll break up?

430
00:18:37,928 --> 00:18:40,128
I don't know. Sounds pretty bad.

431
00:18:40,196 --> 00:18:42,931
Penny's back in her apartment
all by herself.

432
00:18:42,999 --> 00:18:45,367
Really?

433
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:58,268
Would you like to hear
another reason

434
00:18:58,336 --> 00:19:00,203
why men are
better than women?

435
00:19:00,270 --> 00:19:04,506
Sure, let's make it
an even hundred.

436
00:19:04,574 --> 00:19:07,176
You would never kiss me
and make me say "I love you"

437
00:19:07,244 --> 00:19:08,845
and then break up with me.

438
00:19:08,912 --> 00:19:11,780
I wouldn't.

439
00:19:11,849 --> 00:19:14,250
And you know why?

440
00:19:14,318 --> 00:19:15,784
'Cause you're a man.

441
00:19:15,853 --> 00:19:19,288
The champagne of genders.

442
00:19:19,356 --> 00:19:21,457
Well, I may be a man,

443
00:19:21,524 --> 00:19:24,360
but I think I'm the one
that screwed up on this one.

444
00:19:24,427 --> 00:19:27,996
Yeah, well, and you admit it,
like a man.

445
00:19:28,064 --> 00:19:29,464
All you hear
women say is,

446
00:19:29,531 --> 00:19:32,133
"I'll just have a salad."
You know?

447
00:19:32,201 --> 00:19:33,935
"Where's my lip gloss?"

448
00:19:34,003 --> 00:19:36,671
"I think this element
should be called radium."

449
00:19:38,474 --> 00:19:41,109
That last one was Madame Curie.

450
00:19:41,177 --> 00:19:43,811
I figured that out.

451
00:19:43,879 --> 00:19:46,247
You know what?
She was kind of an honorary man.

452
00:19:46,314 --> 00:19:49,684
She had a penis made of science.

453
00:19:53,054 --> 00:19:56,591
Can't believe I'm spending
my wedding night with you.

454
00:19:56,658 --> 00:19:57,992
Really?

455
00:19:58,059 --> 00:20:00,227
I never imagined it
any other way.
