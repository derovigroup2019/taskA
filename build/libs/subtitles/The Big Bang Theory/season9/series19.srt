00:00:03,522 --> 00:00:06,356
(through static):
I didn't understand your e-mail.

2
00:00:06,358 --> 00:00:09,426
Uh, can you repeat that?
You're breaking up.

3
00:00:09,428 --> 00:00:12,529
I didn't understand your e-mail.

4
00:00:12,531 --> 00:00:15,499
Ah. Yeah, I had to get
a little creative

5
00:00:15,501 --> 00:00:19,937
because the S, R and M keys
on my laptop stopped working.

6
00:00:19,939 --> 00:00:22,940
"Deaw Aby,

8
00:00:28,514 --> 00:00:31,515
So, is that a yes?

9
00:00:31,517 --> 00:00:34,051
Sheldon, why don't you get
a new computer?

10
00:00:34,053 --> 00:00:35,986
You know that one's out-of-date.

11
00:00:35,988 --> 00:00:38,222
Oh, but I like this computer.

12
00:00:38,224 --> 00:00:41,892
The video is failing,
and the sound is cutting out.

13
00:00:41,894 --> 00:00:44,294
I'm sorry, I didn't get that.

14
00:00:44,296 --> 00:00:46,530
(through static):
The video is failing,

15
00:00:46,532 --> 00:00:48,665
and the sound is cutting out.

16
00:00:48,667 --> 00:00:52,870
I'm sorry, one more time.
The sound is cutting out.

17
00:00:56,442 --> 00:00:57,775
I can't read that!

18
00:00:57,777 --> 00:00:59,910
The video is failing!

19
00:00:59,912 --> 00:01:03,147
(through static):
Get a new computer.

20
00:01:03,149 --> 00:01:04,314
What?

21
00:01:04,316 --> 00:01:06,416
(through static):
Get a new computer.

22
00:01:06,418 --> 00:01:08,152
What?!

23
00:01:08,154 --> 00:01:10,888
(phone rings)

24
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:11,889
Hello?

25
00:01:11,891 --> 00:01:14,057
Get a new computer!

26
00:01:14,059 --> 00:01:17,694
? Our whole universe
was in a hot, dense state ?

27
00:01:17,696 --> 00:01:21,031
? Then nearly 14 billion years
ago expansion started... Wait! ?

28
00:01:21,033 --> 00:01:22,666
? The Earth began to cool ?

29
00:01:22,668 --> 00:01:25,202
? The autotrophs began to drool,
Neanderthals developed tools ?

30
00:01:25,204 --> 00:01:27,871
? We built the Wall ?
? <i>We built the pyramids</i> ?

31
00:01:27,873 --> 00:01:30,541
? Math, Science, History,
unraveling the mystery ?

32
00:01:30,543 --> 00:01:32,442
? That all started
with a big bang ?

33
00:01:32,444 --> 00:01:34,411
? <i>Bang!</i> ?

36
00:01:42,966 --> 00:01:44,365
This is cool.

37
00:01:44,367 --> 00:01:46,434
When was the last time you
and I built something together?

38
00:01:46,436 --> 00:01:49,136
Scientifically?
A little over a year ago.

39
00:01:49,138 --> 00:01:51,439
LEGOs? Last week in my room.

40
00:01:51,441 --> 00:01:53,975
If there was a Nobrize
for Millennium Falcons

41
00:01:53,977 --> 00:01:56,944
that fall apart when
you pick them up, we'd be set.

42
00:01:56,946 --> 00:01:58,224
Hey, guys!

43
00:01:58,225 --> 00:01:58,745
BOTH: Hey.

44
00:01:58,881 --> 00:01:59,981
What are you doing here?

45
00:01:59,983 --> 00:02:01,616
We heard there were
some sexy scientists

46
00:02:01,618 --> 00:02:03,517
working hard all weekend.
Yeah,

47
00:02:03,519 --> 00:02:06,988
so we brought you some lunch and
we are gonna go look for 'em.

48
00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:09,023
Soup, sandwiches
and emasculation,

49
00:02:09,025 --> 00:02:11,259
just like my mom
used to make.

50
00:02:11,261 --> 00:02:12,493
So, how's it goin'?

51
00:02:12,495 --> 00:02:13,995
Good. Slow.

52
00:02:13,997 --> 00:02:15,730
There's a lot of tedious setup,
but once we get through that

53
00:02:15,732 --> 00:02:16,731
it should go quicker.

54
00:02:16,733 --> 00:02:18,466
Is there anything
we can do to help?

55
00:02:18,468 --> 00:02:20,601
You know what,
this part isn't that technical.

56
00:02:20,603 --> 00:02:21,702
You actually could.

57
00:02:21,704 --> 00:02:25,006
Wow, really? Called my bluff.
All righty then.

58
00:02:25,008 --> 00:02:27,008
Can we really help?

59
00:02:27,010 --> 00:02:28,509
While we finish soldering
these boards, it'd be great

60
00:02:28,511 --> 00:02:31,045
if you guys could wrap these
pipe fittings with Teflon tape.

61
00:02:31,047 --> 00:02:32,046
I'll show you
how to do one.

62
00:02:32,048 --> 00:02:33,681
Hey, w-wouldn't it be funny

63
00:02:33,683 --> 00:02:35,249
if after all your years
of hard work,

64
00:02:35,251 --> 00:02:38,286
I'm the one who makes
a scientific breakthrough?

65
00:02:41,624 --> 00:02:44,859
He doesn't think
that's funny.

66
00:02:46,095 --> 00:02:48,262
(static crackling)

67
00:02:49,232 --> 00:02:50,898
(gasps)

68
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:53,067
(sighs)

69
00:02:56,973 --> 00:02:58,639
(knocking)

70
00:02:58,641 --> 00:03:01,008
I got here
as quickly as I could.

71
00:03:01,010 --> 00:03:03,311
You're too late.

72
00:03:08,084 --> 00:03:10,718

00:03:22,165 --> 00:03:24,398
Sheldon, this is silly.

75
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:27,735
You got emotional
when that lab monkey died.

76
00:03:27,737 --> 00:03:31,672
That lab monkey told me
he loved me in sign language.

77
00:03:31,674 --> 00:03:33,941
? ?

78
00:03:40,583 --> 00:03:41,916
("Taps" ends)

79
00:03:41,918 --> 00:03:43,217
Great.

80
00:03:43,219 --> 00:03:46,554
Now I'm gonna have that song
in my head all day.

81
00:03:47,457 --> 00:03:48,856
Look, I'm-I'm sorry

82
00:03:48,858 --> 00:03:51,192
for your loss, but I think

83
00:03:51,194 --> 00:03:54,061
I have something
that might make you feel better.

84
00:03:54,063 --> 00:03:57,231
I got you a new computer!

85
00:03:58,968 --> 00:04:01,335
How could you do that?

86
00:04:01,337 --> 00:04:03,170
Do what?

87
00:04:03,172 --> 00:04:06,374
Choosing a new laptop is
an incredibly personal ritual.

88
00:04:06,376 --> 00:04:07,742
You have taken away

89
00:04:07,744 --> 00:04:10,611
weeks of agonizing thought,
tedious research,

90
00:04:10,613 --> 00:04:13,981
sleepless nights filled
with indecision. I j...

91
00:04:14,817 --> 00:04:16,984
Haven't I lost enough today?

92
00:04:18,287 --> 00:04:22,890
Well, the guy at the store said
this one is great.

93
00:04:22,892 --> 00:04:24,859
Oh! Oh, the guy!

94
00:04:24,861 --> 00:04:26,827
Oh, pardon me.

95
00:04:26,829 --> 00:04:28,462
I-I didn't realize
you'd spoken to the guy.

96
00:04:28,464 --> 00:04:30,030
Yeah, tell me,

97
00:04:30,032 --> 00:04:32,600
did the guy choose one
with a 4K display

98
00:04:32,602 --> 00:04:34,001
and a Thunderbolt port?

99
00:04:34,003 --> 00:04:35,202
Yes.
Yeah?

100
00:04:35,204 --> 00:04:36,370
D-Did the guy make sure

101
00:04:36,372 --> 00:04:39,140
that this has a one-terabyte
solid-state drive?

102
00:04:39,142 --> 00:04:40,674
Yes.
Yeah? Oh, well,

103
00:04:40,676 --> 00:04:43,878
was this guy Rick from
Computer Solutions on Colorado?

104
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:44,845
Yes.

105
00:04:44,847 --> 00:04:46,213
Yeah, well,
he does know his stuff.

106
00:04:49,252 --> 00:04:51,085
After you wrap the body
in reflective tape,

107
00:04:51,087 --> 00:04:53,254
the ends get Teflon tape
so we can get a tight seal.

108
00:04:53,256 --> 00:04:55,389
Like this? Oh.
Yeah, perfect.

109
00:04:55,391 --> 00:04:57,124
And it helps to have
small, delicate fingers.

110
00:04:57,126 --> 00:04:58,726
So don't be discouraged
if you can't do it as fast

111
00:04:58,728 --> 00:05:00,361
as me and Howard. (chuckles)

112
00:05:01,697 --> 00:05:03,063
I don't know
if we have enough solder

113
00:05:03,065 --> 00:05:04,298
to finish
these circuit boards.

114
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:05,529
We had a full spool yesterday.

115
00:05:05,530 --> 00:05:06,331
What can I say,

116
00:05:06,335 --> 00:05:08,936
I play hard,
I solder even harder.

117
00:05:10,506 --> 00:05:12,506
Sometimes he solders at home
with his shirt off.

118
00:05:12,508 --> 00:05:14,508
It's like a beer commercial.

119
00:05:14,510 --> 00:05:16,243
(blows, clicks tongue)

120
00:05:17,213 --> 00:05:19,213
Well, we got to make a run
to the hardware store.

121
00:05:19,215 --> 00:05:21,515
How can you call yourself a
scientist and run out of solder?

122
00:05:21,517 --> 00:05:24,318
Well, funny story.
So, we have plenty

123
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:26,253
of the 60/40
tin-to-lead ratio solder,

124
00:05:26,255 --> 00:05:28,915
but the spools look a lot
like the 63/37 tin-to...

125
00:05:28,916 --> 00:05:29,555
Honey, honey,

126
00:05:29,559 --> 00:05:32,960
honey, let me stop you.
That is-is not a funny story.

127
00:05:34,096 --> 00:05:35,830
You want to come with us?

128
00:05:35,832 --> 00:05:37,355
I'm kind of getting
into the groove here.

129
00:05:37,356 --> 00:05:37,976
Yeah, you guys run

130
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,821
to the store and let the women
handle the science for a change.

131
00:05:40,822 --> 00:05:41,500
LEONARD: Okay.

132
00:05:41,504 --> 00:05:43,537
We'll be back
as soon as we can.

133
00:05:43,539 --> 00:05:46,807
(clears throat)
Okay, so what...

134
00:05:46,809 --> 00:05:49,009
is solder?

135
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:54,148
I suppose I should
set this up.

136
00:05:54,150 --> 00:05:57,785
Or would you like
to rob me of that, too?

137
00:05:57,787 --> 00:06:00,754
Knock it off or I'll start
making W-H sounds

138
00:06:00,756 --> 00:06:03,791
for words
that just have a W.

139
00:06:03,793 --> 00:06:04,425
You wouldn't.

140
00:06:04,427 --> 00:06:07,761
"Hwatch" me.

141
00:06:08,664 --> 00:06:10,064
Fine. I'm sorry.

142
00:06:10,066 --> 00:06:11,932
Thank you for
the thoughtful gift.

143
00:06:11,934 --> 00:06:13,534
I really do appreciate it.

144
00:06:13,536 --> 00:06:17,938
As you know, I had become
attached to my old laptop.

145
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:19,473
But I'm sure, in time,
that this one will...

146
00:06:19,475 --> 00:06:21,408
(gasps)
Jeepers creepers,

147
00:06:21,410 --> 00:06:23,611
that started up fast!

148
00:06:23,613 --> 00:06:25,646
I thought you might
like it.

149
00:06:25,648 --> 00:06:27,848
Look at the 4K resolution.

150
00:06:27,850 --> 00:06:29,617
Next time we Skype,
I'm gonna count

151
00:06:29,619 --> 00:06:32,620
all those nostril hairs.

152
00:06:32,622 --> 00:06:35,256
Or you could just look
into my eyes.

153
00:06:35,258 --> 00:06:37,358
But you only have two eyes.

154
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:40,494
You got a lot of nostril hairs.

155
00:06:40,496 --> 00:06:42,987
Well, you know,
as long as you're happy.

156
00:06:43,011 --> 00:06:44,533
Oh.

157
00:06:44,534 --> 00:06:46,000
I am. (chuckles)

158
00:06:46,002 --> 00:06:48,636
And Rick said you could bring in
your old one to recycle it.

159
00:06:48,638 --> 00:06:51,539
Oh. Uh, no, no, no, thank you.

160
00:06:51,541 --> 00:06:53,140
Oh, but he said
you can get store credit.

161
00:06:53,142 --> 00:06:55,809
Well, no, I just...
I-I don't want to recycle it.

162
00:06:55,811 --> 00:06:57,411
And I don't want store credit.

163
00:06:57,413 --> 00:06:58,312
But why wouldn't...

164
00:06:58,314 --> 00:07:00,147
Can we please change
the subject?

165
00:07:00,149 --> 00:07:02,716
O-Okay.

166
00:07:02,718 --> 00:07:06,053
How 'bout we change it to why
you're being weird about this?

167
00:07:06,055 --> 00:07:07,154
I'm not being weird.

168
00:07:07,156 --> 00:07:09,390
I...

169
00:07:09,392 --> 00:07:11,392
It's hard to explain.

170
00:07:11,394 --> 00:07:15,296
Sheldon, just tell me.

171
00:07:16,165 --> 00:07:18,198
It might be easier to show you.

172
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:20,367
Okay.

173
00:07:21,237 --> 00:07:23,804
We'd have to take your car.

174
00:07:23,806 --> 00:07:25,973
All right.

175
00:07:28,344 --> 00:07:31,979
And I'm gonna need you to sign
a nondisclosure agreement.

176
00:07:32,949 --> 00:07:36,317
Well, I signed one
before we slept together.

177
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:38,485
Why not now?

178
00:07:42,525 --> 00:07:45,392
Penny says they're having fun
working on the prototype.

179
00:07:45,394 --> 00:07:49,063
Remember when her fun was
nightclubs and drinking games?

180
00:07:49,065 --> 00:07:51,699
I know. I'm lowering
the bar so slowly.

181
00:07:51,701 --> 00:07:54,835
This time next year
she'll have a coin collection.

182
00:07:54,837 --> 00:07:56,236
Excuse me.

183
00:07:56,238 --> 00:07:58,505
You guys interested in a free
screening of an upcoming movie?

184
00:07:58,507 --> 00:07:59,406
Oh. Sorry, we can't.

185
00:07:59,408 --> 00:08:01,375
Well, hang on.
What movie is it?

186
00:08:01,377 --> 00:08:04,178
Oh, I can't tell you.
But it does star Will Smith.

187
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:06,046
Wait.

188
00:08:06,048 --> 00:08:07,481
I bet it's <i>Suicide Squad.</i>

189
00:08:07,483 --> 00:08:09,283
Let's check it out.

190
00:08:09,285 --> 00:08:10,484
What about the girls?

191
00:08:10,486 --> 00:08:12,286
Penny just said
they're having fun.

192
00:08:12,288 --> 00:08:14,822
Honestly, you want to wrap tape
around a bunch of pipe fittings

193
00:08:14,824 --> 00:08:16,290
all afternoon?

194
00:08:17,259 --> 00:08:18,492
Okay, we'll take 'em.

195
00:08:18,494 --> 00:08:20,327
Okay.
But, I swear,

196
00:08:20,329 --> 00:08:22,329
if it's Will Smith
in <i>Shark Tale 2,</i>

197
00:08:22,331 --> 00:08:25,699
it better be at least as good
as the original.

198
00:08:26,936 --> 00:08:28,602
I mean, it's crazy,
isn't it?

199
00:08:28,604 --> 00:08:30,738
I moved here from Nebraska
to be an actress,

200
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:33,707
and now I'm sitting
in an engineering lab at Caltech

201
00:08:33,709 --> 00:08:37,911
helping to build a prototype
for a high-tech guidance system.

202
00:08:37,913 --> 00:08:39,913
It is crazy. It's also crazy

203
00:08:39,915 --> 00:08:43,417
that I've made 14 of these
and you've made three.

204
00:08:43,419 --> 00:08:45,452
(knocking)

205
00:08:46,355 --> 00:08:48,822
Hey. Where are the guys?

206
00:08:48,824 --> 00:08:50,224
Oh, they went to the store
to get solder,

207
00:08:50,226 --> 00:08:53,827
which is metal you melt
to make science things.

208
00:08:54,730 --> 00:08:56,330
Since when
do you work on weekends?

209
00:08:56,332 --> 00:08:57,831
I'm an astrophysicist.

210
00:08:57,833 --> 00:09:00,100
The stars don't take a day off.

211
00:09:00,102 --> 00:09:02,903
You were home alone
and had no one to play with?

212
00:09:02,905 --> 00:09:06,173
Well, the cleaning lady was
there, but she doesn't like me.

213
00:09:07,343 --> 00:09:08,709
You need any help?

214
00:09:08,711 --> 00:09:11,345
Not with
Lightning McQueen here.

215
00:09:11,347 --> 00:09:13,080
I think we're good.

216
00:09:13,082 --> 00:09:14,648
Okay. That's cool.

217
00:09:14,650 --> 00:09:16,984
I guess everybody's involved
in this project but me.

218
00:09:16,986 --> 00:09:19,753
So... see ya.

219
00:09:19,755 --> 00:09:22,423
(door shuts)

220
00:09:22,425 --> 00:09:23,457
I feel bad.

221
00:09:23,459 --> 00:09:24,525
Should we have asked him
to stay?

222
00:09:24,527 --> 00:09:26,694
KOOTHRAPPALI (high-pitched):
Yes.

223
00:09:29,865 --> 00:09:32,266
Will you please tell me
where we're going?

224
00:09:32,268 --> 00:09:35,936
Sorry, you're on
a need-to-know basis.

225
00:09:36,872 --> 00:09:38,172
I'm driving the car.

226
00:09:38,174 --> 00:09:40,541
I need to know.

227
00:09:40,543 --> 00:09:41,608
Right.

228
00:09:41,610 --> 00:09:43,310
So where are we going?

229
00:09:43,312 --> 00:09:46,814
No, I meant turn right,
and you missed it.

230
00:09:46,816 --> 00:09:49,483
Maybe you do need to know.

231
00:09:51,787 --> 00:09:53,821
(indistinct chatter)

232
00:09:53,823 --> 00:09:55,022
What are we gonna tell
the girls?

233
00:09:55,024 --> 00:09:56,190
It's not a problem.

234
00:09:56,192 --> 00:09:57,324
I mean without lying.

235
00:09:57,326 --> 00:09:59,693
And now you've made it
a problem.

236
00:09:59,695 --> 00:10:01,762
Come on. We're
a couple of smart guys.

237
00:10:01,764 --> 00:10:03,630
I'm sure we can come up
with a way to explain this

238
00:10:03,632 --> 00:10:05,299
that doesn't make us
look bad.

239
00:10:05,301 --> 00:10:07,167
(phone chimes)

240
00:10:07,169 --> 00:10:09,103
Oh!

241
00:10:09,105 --> 00:10:10,904
The boys had to drive
all the way to San Bernardino

242
00:10:10,906 --> 00:10:12,740
for the solder and got a flat.

243
00:10:14,810 --> 00:10:15,843
(phone chimes)

244
00:10:15,845 --> 00:10:18,245
They bought it.

245
00:10:18,247 --> 00:10:19,813
But we're gonna have to

246
00:10:19,815 --> 00:10:21,448
put the spare on
before we go back.

247
00:10:21,450 --> 00:10:23,150
Oh, you're good at this.

248
00:10:23,152 --> 00:10:25,486
Well, I lie a lot.

249
00:10:26,322 --> 00:10:27,988
MAN:
Hey, guys, thank you

250
00:10:27,990 --> 00:10:29,923
for being a part of our
test screening. You're about

251
00:10:29,925 --> 00:10:32,626
to be one of the first audiences
to see <i>Suicide Squad.</i>

252
00:10:32,628 --> 00:10:34,595
(applause and cheering)
Hey!

253
00:10:34,597 --> 00:10:35,863
(laughs)
You were right.

254
00:10:35,865 --> 00:10:36,997
Oh, I keep telling you--

255
00:10:36,999 --> 00:10:40,534
good things happen
to bad people.

256
00:10:40,536 --> 00:10:42,569
Uh, we're gonna get started
in a couple minutes. Enjoy.

257
00:10:42,571 --> 00:10:44,638
Who are you texting?

258
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:47,074
Raj. He really wants
to see this movie.

259
00:10:47,076 --> 00:10:49,042
Oh, he'll never
make it in time.

260
00:10:49,044 --> 00:10:51,912
I know.
I want to make him feel bad.

261
00:10:53,282 --> 00:10:56,750
"Ha, ha. Leonard and I are
about to see <i>Suicide Squad.</i>

262
00:10:56,752 --> 00:11:00,587
Spoiler alert: when I see you
I'm gonna spoil it."

263
00:11:00,589 --> 00:11:02,456
You're a good friend.

264
00:11:02,458 --> 00:11:04,124
(chuckles)

265
00:11:04,126 --> 00:11:06,393
(phone chimes)

266
00:11:10,099 --> 00:11:12,432
Okay. (clears throat)

267
00:11:13,569 --> 00:11:18,238
Would you ladies please
leave the room for a moment?

268
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:20,174
Why?

269
00:11:20,176 --> 00:11:24,144
I need to rub my genitals
on their prototype.

270
00:11:24,146 --> 00:11:26,446
What's going on?

271
00:11:26,448 --> 00:11:28,816
Leonard and Howard
don't have a flat.

272
00:11:28,818 --> 00:11:31,018
They went to the movies. Look.

273
00:11:31,954 --> 00:11:33,687
Son of a bitch.
Un-freakin' believable.

274
00:11:33,689 --> 00:11:35,956
Oh. You know what?
I'm gonna let them know

275
00:11:35,958 --> 00:11:38,258
that I'm here with you
and that they're busted.

276
00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:39,560
No. You know what? Don't. Don't.

277
00:11:39,562 --> 00:11:41,061
Let's let them think
they're getting away with it.

278
00:11:41,063 --> 00:11:44,131
Yeah, let's see how deep a hole
they can dig for themselves.

279
00:11:44,133 --> 00:11:45,599
Mm-hmm.
Interesting.

280
00:11:45,601 --> 00:11:47,734
I mean, it's not testicles
on a cryostat,

281
00:11:47,736 --> 00:11:49,937
but I like it.

282
00:11:58,121 --> 00:12:00,288
Why do you have
a storage unit?

283
00:12:00,290 --> 00:12:02,257
Just wait.

284
00:12:02,259 --> 00:12:04,359
How long have you had it?

285
00:12:05,996 --> 00:12:07,195
Just wait.

286
00:12:07,732 --> 00:12:09,932
Do you want me to hold
that computer?

287
00:12:09,934 --> 00:12:12,768
Just wai... You know what?
Actually, yes, thank you.

288
00:12:20,711 --> 00:12:24,013
Welcome to my Fortress of Shame.

289
00:12:29,053 --> 00:12:30,286
I'm sorry.

290
00:12:30,288 --> 00:12:32,588
What-what am I looking at?

291
00:12:32,590 --> 00:12:35,925
It's basically everything
I've ever owned.

292
00:12:35,927 --> 00:12:38,727
Um, every book,

293
00:12:38,729 --> 00:12:42,731
every T-shirt, every piece
of broken electronics.

294
00:12:42,733 --> 00:12:45,901
Just... all of it.

295
00:12:48,806 --> 00:12:51,407
All of it?

296
00:12:51,409 --> 00:12:53,309
I have a Ziploc bag

297
00:12:53,311 --> 00:12:56,479
filled with all
my old Ziploc bags.

298
00:13:02,453 --> 00:13:05,187
Okay.

299
00:13:05,189 --> 00:13:07,256
Well...

300
00:13:07,258 --> 00:13:09,325
I would like to tell you

301
00:13:09,327 --> 00:13:12,094
that there is

302
00:13:12,096 --> 00:13:16,065
nothing here to be ashamed of.

303
00:13:17,301 --> 00:13:19,468
So I'm gonna need a minute.

304
00:13:24,275 --> 00:13:27,176
All right, how are we gonna
play this when they return?

305
00:13:27,178 --> 00:13:28,644
I know.

306
00:13:28,646 --> 00:13:31,814
You guys should totally
be making out with me.

307
00:13:33,951 --> 00:13:36,352
Sweetie, I know you think
jokes like that are funny,

308
00:13:36,354 --> 00:13:38,087
but do you really think
you could handle

309
00:13:38,089 --> 00:13:39,522
making out with both of us?

310
00:13:41,192 --> 00:13:42,525
No, ma'am.

311
00:13:45,129 --> 00:13:47,530
Okay. Okay,
how about this?

312
00:13:47,532 --> 00:13:48,631
They don't know
you're here with us,

313
00:13:48,633 --> 00:13:50,866
so you hide in the closet.
When they show up,

314
00:13:50,868 --> 00:13:52,434
we'll hear
whatever their dumb story is

315
00:13:52,436 --> 00:13:54,270
about where they were,
we'll pretend to believe them,

316
00:13:54,272 --> 00:13:57,006
and just when they think they
got away with it, you jump out.

317
00:13:57,008 --> 00:13:58,908
Yeah, that's pretty good.
I love it!

318
00:13:58,910 --> 00:14:01,143
I'll be all like, "Busted!"

319
00:14:01,145 --> 00:14:02,611
And they'll be like, "What?!"

320
00:14:02,613 --> 00:14:05,648
And then we'll all be like,
"Oh, <i>yeah!"</i>

321
00:14:07,051 --> 00:14:08,384
Yeah, I-I get it.

322
00:14:08,386 --> 00:14:10,586
I wouldn't make out
with me, either.

323
00:14:12,924 --> 00:14:15,891
In here is every clock radio
I've ever owned.

324
00:14:15,893 --> 00:14:17,793
Calculators, VHS tapes.

325
00:14:17,795 --> 00:14:19,195
Yeah. Oh.

326
00:14:19,197 --> 00:14:21,397
Sporting equipment.

327
00:14:23,401 --> 00:14:25,634
Y-You have sporting equipment?

328
00:14:25,636 --> 00:14:27,970
Well, oh, it's just a...
it's a... a golf ball

329
00:14:27,972 --> 00:14:29,972
that my brother
threw at my head.

330
00:14:29,974 --> 00:14:32,741
You can still
feel the dent.

331
00:14:32,743 --> 00:14:36,011
It's right next to
the hockey puck dent.

332
00:14:38,382 --> 00:14:40,950
Okay, why do you have
a bin of pinecones?

333
00:14:40,952 --> 00:14:43,385
I used to collect
them as a child.

334
00:14:43,387 --> 00:14:45,688
The spiral of scales open in

335
00:14:45,690 --> 00:14:47,423
the Fibonacci sequence.

336
00:14:47,425 --> 00:14:49,325
A fact that,
when you tell your brother,

337
00:14:49,327 --> 00:14:52,261
gets a golf ball
thrown at your head.

338
00:14:54,565 --> 00:14:59,134
So, why do you feel
you need to save these things?

339
00:14:59,136 --> 00:15:01,370
I'd like to say it's nostalgia,

340
00:15:01,372 --> 00:15:04,440
but every time I think
of throwing anything away,

341
00:15:04,442 --> 00:15:06,008
my ears start to ring,

342
00:15:06,010 --> 00:15:08,210
and I get butterflies
in my stomach.

343
00:15:08,212 --> 00:15:09,678
And then it feels like

344
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:11,880
the butterflies
get eaten by rats,

345
00:15:11,882 --> 00:15:14,116
and then, the-the rats
get eaten by...

346
00:15:14,118 --> 00:15:15,084
Okay.

347
00:15:15,086 --> 00:15:16,719
I get it. I get it.

348
00:15:16,721 --> 00:15:19,622
It ends with dinosaurs.

349
00:15:21,659 --> 00:15:24,426
I'm sorry
if you think less of me.

350
00:15:25,329 --> 00:15:27,263
I don't.

351
00:15:27,265 --> 00:15:29,064
Really?

352
00:15:29,066 --> 00:15:31,066
'Cause every time
I come in here,

353
00:15:31,068 --> 00:15:32,968
I think less of me.

354
00:15:32,970 --> 00:15:34,336
Why?

355
00:15:34,338 --> 00:15:36,171
Because I'm a fraud.

356
00:15:36,173 --> 00:15:37,606
No. I purport

357
00:15:37,608 --> 00:15:39,441
to be a man of the mind.

358
00:15:39,443 --> 00:15:43,178
I've been such a-a vocal
champion of The Singularity,

359
00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:45,014
but how can I leave
my body behind

360
00:15:45,016 --> 00:15:47,283
and become one
with the Internet

361
00:15:47,285 --> 00:15:49,985
when I've never even thrown
a toothbrush away?

362
00:15:52,189 --> 00:15:53,989
It's okay, Sheldon.

363
00:15:53,991 --> 00:15:57,426
You know, I... I've saved
a lot of weird things, too.

364
00:15:57,428 --> 00:15:59,628
Like what?

365
00:15:59,630 --> 00:16:01,563
Well, um,

366
00:16:01,565 --> 00:16:04,967
did you know
I have a microscope slide

367
00:16:04,969 --> 00:16:06,402
with a little bit of tissue

368
00:16:06,404 --> 00:16:09,405
from the first brain
I ever dissected?

369
00:16:09,407 --> 00:16:11,607
I have an old teddy bear

370
00:16:11,609 --> 00:16:14,209
I secretly wiped my nose on
for years.

371
00:16:21,118 --> 00:16:23,686
It's not a contest.

372
00:16:25,956 --> 00:16:28,524
Okay, here they come.
Go hide.

373
00:16:28,526 --> 00:16:30,592
Oh, man, when I come out
of the closet,

374
00:16:30,594 --> 00:16:33,195
I'm gonna nail those guys!

375
00:16:35,299 --> 00:16:37,299
Yeah, I heard it. Shut up.

376
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:44,039
Hey.
Hi.

377
00:16:44,041 --> 00:16:46,075
Hey, what's this?

378
00:16:46,077 --> 00:16:48,010
Listen, we did a stupid thing.

379
00:16:48,012 --> 00:16:51,814
We went to a movie and
lied about it, but we feel bad

380
00:16:51,816 --> 00:16:53,515
and want to make it up
to you.

381
00:16:53,517 --> 00:16:55,284
So, these are for you,
and if you're not too mad,

382
00:16:55,286 --> 00:16:56,511
we'd love to take
you guys to dinner.

383
00:16:56,512 --> 00:16:57,040
WOLOWITZ: Yeah.

384
00:16:57,054 --> 00:16:59,455
Anywhere you want.
Oh. Well,

385
00:16:59,457 --> 00:17:01,557
thank you for being honest.
PENNY: Yeah. You know,

386
00:17:01,559 --> 00:17:03,025
I want to be upset, but we did

387
00:17:03,027 --> 00:17:04,493
kind of have fun
working on the prototype.

388
00:17:04,495 --> 00:17:06,662
KOOTHRAPPALI: Don't forgive them!
Stay mad at them!

389
00:17:08,065 --> 00:17:10,132
What is he doing
in there?

390
00:17:10,134 --> 00:17:13,268
Busting you!

391
00:17:14,538 --> 00:17:15,938
It's okay.
They apologized.

392
00:17:15,940 --> 00:17:17,106
Yeah, it's fine.

393
00:17:17,108 --> 00:17:21,243
Well this is kind
of anti-climactic.

394
00:17:22,246 --> 00:17:23,846
You know what
wasn't anti-climactic?

395
00:17:23,848 --> 00:17:25,547
The end of the movie. Get this.

396
00:17:25,549 --> 00:17:27,616
No spoilers! No spoilers!

397
00:17:28,486 --> 00:17:30,652
And he's back
in the closet.

398
00:17:32,022 --> 00:17:34,590
Ready for dinner?

399
00:17:34,592 --> 00:17:36,792
Yeah.

400
00:17:38,796 --> 00:17:40,529
Should we invite Raj?

401
00:17:40,531 --> 00:17:42,865
KOOTHRAPPALI (high-pitched):
Yes.

402
00:17:45,035 --> 00:17:47,302
So, no one else knows
about this?

403
00:17:47,304 --> 00:17:49,505
Only you.

404
00:17:51,108 --> 00:17:53,709
Thank you for trusting me.

405
00:17:53,711 --> 00:17:55,711
What good is having
a girlfriend

406
00:17:55,713 --> 00:17:58,447
if you can't unload your
psychological sewage on her?

407
00:17:59,850 --> 00:18:02,451
That's me,
your emotional outhouse.

408
00:18:04,188 --> 00:18:06,088
You know,

409
00:18:06,090 --> 00:18:09,758
if you ever decide you want
to do something about this,

410
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:11,427
I'm-I'm here for you.

411
00:18:11,429 --> 00:18:13,695
Thank you.

412
00:18:13,697 --> 00:18:15,998
I wouldn't even know
how to begin.

413
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,634
Baby steps, I guess.

414
00:18:18,636 --> 00:18:21,103
Mm.

415
00:18:27,578 --> 00:18:30,712
I suppose I could try
getting rid of the golf ball.

416
00:18:31,515 --> 00:18:33,449
Oh. Okay.

417
00:18:34,452 --> 00:18:37,286
I will always have the dent
to remember it by.

418
00:18:46,163 --> 00:18:49,331
(sighs heavily)

419
00:18:52,937 --> 00:18:54,636
You did it.

420
00:18:54,638 --> 00:18:56,839
Do you feel okay?

421
00:18:57,875 --> 00:19:00,042
Actually, yes.

422
00:19:01,245 --> 00:19:02,678
I do.

423
00:19:03,581 --> 00:19:05,380
Well, I'm proud of you.

424
00:19:05,382 --> 00:19:07,583
Oh. Thanks.

425
00:19:24,565 --> 00:19:28,300
I'm glad I told you
about the storage unit.

426
00:19:28,302 --> 00:19:30,202
Well, I feel closer to you now.

427
00:19:30,857 --> 00:19:33,024
Oh, I feel closer to you, too.

428
00:19:33,026 --> 00:19:34,292
You know,

429
00:19:34,294 --> 00:19:37,929
it's still a couple
of hours until my bedtime.

430
00:19:44,704 --> 00:19:47,338
What did you have in mind?

431
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:49,774
You look amazing.

432
00:19:53,246 --> 00:19:57,815
I mean,
this resolution is remarkable.

433
00:19:58,752 --> 00:20:02,287
I really had to go home
for this?

434
00:20:02,289 --> 00:20:06,624
Yes, but it's like
you're right here in the room.

435
00:20:06,626 --> 00:20:09,727
And yet, I'm not.

436
00:20:09,729 --> 00:20:13,298
But I feel like I could
reach out and touch you.

437
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:15,466
And yet, you can't.

438
00:20:17,270 --> 00:20:19,137
I know!
