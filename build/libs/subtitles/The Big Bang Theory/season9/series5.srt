1
00:00:03,313 --> 00:00:05,647
Hey, ready for lunch?
Oh, one sec.

2
00:00:05,649 --> 00:00:09,084
Is that the prototype drive
system for the high-G rover?

3
00:00:09,086 --> 00:00:11,453
No, Bernadette
got me a Fitbit

4
00:00:11,455 --> 00:00:14,490
so she can track
how much I'm exercising.

5
00:00:15,825 --> 00:00:19,094
That'll teach her to care
about your health.

6
00:00:19,096 --> 00:00:22,865
I can't wait to see the look
on her face when I die young.

7
00:00:23,967 --> 00:00:25,367
When was the last actual
exercise you got?

8
00:00:25,369 --> 00:00:26,735
The other day, when

9
00:00:26,737 --> 00:00:30,172
she tried to put that Fitbit
on me and I ran away from her.

10
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:32,641
According to a recent study,

11
00:00:32,643 --> 00:00:35,410
simply thinking about exercise,
even while sitting still,

12
00:00:35,412 --> 00:00:36,778
can have physical benefits.

13
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:39,381
For all you know,
I could be exercising right now.

14
00:00:39,383 --> 00:00:42,284
Are you?
Eh, I'll do it tomorrow.

15
00:00:43,186 --> 00:00:44,486
It wouldn't be the worst thing

16
00:00:44,488 --> 00:00:45,654
if we were more active.

17
00:00:45,656 --> 00:00:48,056
Oh. You make
an excellent point.

18
00:00:51,227 --> 00:00:53,929
Ooh, I think
I'm getting a runner's high!

19
00:00:53,931 --> 00:00:57,566
? Our whole universe
was in hot, dense state ?

20
00:00:57,568 --> 00:01:00,902
? Then nearly 14 billion years
ago expansion started... Wait! ?

21
00:01:00,904 --> 00:01:02,537
? The Earth began to cool ?

22
00:01:02,539 --> 00:01:05,073
? The autotrophs began to drool,
Neanderthals developed tools ?

23
00:01:05,075 --> 00:01:07,742
? We built the Wall ?
?<i> We built the pyramids</i> ?

24
00:01:07,744 --> 00:01:10,412
? Math, Science, History,
unraveling the mystery ?

25
00:01:10,414 --> 00:01:12,313
? That all started
with a big bang ?

26
00:01:12,315 --> 00:01:14,211
?<i> Bang!</i> ?

27
00:01:14,212 --> 00:01:18,212

29
00:01:23,914 --> 00:01:26,146
Look at all these activities
the university has.

30
00:01:26,147 --> 00:01:29,181
Rock climbing club,
archery, flag football.

31
00:01:29,183 --> 00:01:32,518
Had me at flag,
lost me at football.

32
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:35,154
Yeah, I think it's great you
guys want to get more exercise,

33
00:01:35,156 --> 00:01:38,090
but do you really think sports
is the right choice for you?

34
00:01:38,092 --> 00:01:40,058
What are you saying?
We're not coordinated enough

35
00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:41,159
to play sports?

36
00:01:41,161 --> 00:01:43,562
Okay, Leonard, sweetheart,

37
00:01:43,564 --> 00:01:46,865
you twisted your ankle
playing<i> Scrabble.</i>

38
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:49,701
I got a triple-word score

39
00:01:49,703 --> 00:01:51,370
with a double letter "Q."
If that's not a time

40
00:01:51,372 --> 00:01:54,272
to bust out the<i> Scrabble</i> dance,
what's the point of having one?

41
00:01:56,175 --> 00:02:00,011
Hey, Barry Kripke
started a fencing club.

42
00:02:00,013 --> 00:02:03,982
Interesting. Sword fighting does
hold a certain elegant appeal.

43
00:02:03,984 --> 00:02:05,817
And I would imagine
it meets many

44
00:02:05,819 --> 00:02:08,453
of our personal criteria
for a sport.

45
00:02:08,455 --> 00:02:10,789
It's indoors, so no sunscreen.

46
00:02:11,457 --> 00:02:12,457
No throwing, no catching,

47
00:02:12,459 --> 00:02:14,259
no running.

48
00:02:14,261 --> 00:02:17,229
No gym shorts
that can be yanked down.

49
00:02:18,397 --> 00:02:19,598
Or worse, up.

50
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:21,399
Preach.

51
00:02:21,401 --> 00:02:22,734
And as
an added bonus,

52
00:02:22,736 --> 00:02:24,469
the word "touch?" comes
from fencing.

53
00:02:24,471 --> 00:02:26,504
It would be our only opportunity
to use it

54
00:02:26,506 --> 00:02:29,240
in a non-metaphorical sense.

55
00:02:29,242 --> 00:02:31,409
What about a game of tag
on a French schoolyard?

56
00:02:31,411 --> 00:02:33,311
Ah, touch?.

57
00:02:36,048 --> 00:02:37,315
Thanks for coming by.

58
00:02:37,317 --> 00:02:39,017
Sure. So how can we help?

59
00:02:39,019 --> 00:02:41,186
Well, I know
more women are

60
00:02:41,188 --> 00:02:42,987
buying comics than ever,
but for some reason,

61
00:02:42,989 --> 00:02:44,856
I-I can't get
'em in here.

62
00:02:44,858 --> 00:02:46,891
All right, well,
what have you tried so far?

63
00:02:46,893 --> 00:02:50,495
Uh, I've-I've been stocking
more female-oriented titles.

64
00:02:50,497 --> 00:02:53,765
Uh, in the bathroom, I folded
the end of the toilet paper

65
00:02:53,767 --> 00:02:55,033
into a triangle.

66
00:02:55,035 --> 00:02:56,367
And,
uh,

67
00:02:56,369 --> 00:02:58,236
you are now sitting
in the official

68
00:02:58,238 --> 00:03:00,471
breastfeeding area.

69
00:03:02,741 --> 00:03:05,810
Really? In a comic book store?
Oh,

70
00:03:05,812 --> 00:03:08,079
don't worry. I-I've got
a camera right up here,

71
00:03:08,081 --> 00:03:10,648
so I could watch
from the counter

72
00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:14,151
and make sure guys
aren't being pervs.

73
00:03:18,624 --> 00:03:19,757
Anyway,

74
00:03:19,759 --> 00:03:21,592
so what do I got to do to-to

75
00:03:21,594 --> 00:03:22,827
get you in
the door?

76
00:03:22,829 --> 00:03:24,562
Well, for starters,

77
00:03:24,564 --> 00:03:26,864
you might want to rethink
some of this artwork.

78
00:03:26,866 --> 00:03:31,235
I mean, this woman's
actually on a leash like a dog.

79
00:03:31,237 --> 00:03:34,038
Well, you don't know
the backstory.

80
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:37,108
Maybe she kept jumping up
on the couch.

81
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:45,074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

82
00:03:50,055 --> 00:03:52,056
I feel cool.

83
00:03:52,058 --> 00:03:55,559
Like Puss in Boots.

84
00:03:55,561 --> 00:03:58,380
I always wanted to be
a swashbuckler when I was a kid.

85
00:03:58,404 --> 00:03:59,097
Technically,

86
00:03:59,098 --> 00:04:01,265
"swashbuckler" is a combination
of two terms.

87
00:04:01,267 --> 00:04:03,867
"Swash" referring to the sound
of the sword.

88
00:04:03,869 --> 00:04:05,903
Swash.

89
00:04:06,838 --> 00:04:08,272
And
then

90
00:04:08,274 --> 00:04:11,441
"buckler" meaning a small
shield, which you don't have.

91
00:04:11,443 --> 00:04:13,043
We can still be swashers.
Hmm.

92
00:04:13,045 --> 00:04:15,045
Well said, Puss.

93
00:04:16,347 --> 00:04:20,684
Gentlemen, welcome
to the fencing club.

94
00:04:20,686 --> 00:04:24,521
Before we start, I just want to
warn you, fencing isn't a joke.

95
00:04:24,523 --> 00:04:26,323
I hope you're not here because
you think it's going to be

96
00:04:26,325 --> 00:04:28,258
like<i> Star Wars.</i>

97
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:29,159
That's not why we're here.

98
00:04:29,161 --> 00:04:30,360
Yeah, I'm here
because I think

99
00:04:30,362 --> 00:04:32,195
it's gonna be like
<i>Game of Thrones.</i>

100
00:04:32,197 --> 00:04:34,564
And maybe
a little<i> Princess Bride.</i>

101
00:04:34,566 --> 00:04:36,366
Ooh, ooh! I forgot
about<i> Princess Bride!</i>

102
00:04:36,368 --> 00:04:38,902
That's my answer!

103
00:04:38,904 --> 00:04:43,139
Well, sorry to disappoint you,
but fencing is a serious sport.

104
00:04:43,141 --> 00:04:44,174
If you're not willing
to put in the effort,

105
00:04:44,176 --> 00:04:46,276
you might as well just leave
now.

106
00:04:46,278 --> 00:04:48,511
We're not afraid of physical activity.
Yeah.

107
00:04:48,513 --> 00:04:51,114
I already ran 18 miles today.

108
00:04:52,216 --> 00:04:54,818
All right. Let's begin
with some fundamentals.

109
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:57,153
This is the en
garde position.

110
00:04:57,155 --> 00:05:00,123
Feet are in an "L."
Heels in a straight line.

111
00:05:00,125 --> 00:05:01,091
Elbow is
about a fist

112
00:05:01,093 --> 00:05:02,692
from the rib cage.

113
00:05:02,694 --> 00:05:05,728
Notice my dominant
leg faces forward.

114
00:05:05,730 --> 00:05:06,763
Oh, dear.

115
00:05:06,765 --> 00:05:08,064
What's wrong, Cooper?

116
00:05:08,066 --> 00:05:11,468
Well, I'm not sure
I have a dominant leg.

117
00:05:11,470 --> 00:05:13,369
They're both pretty submissive.

118
00:05:15,773 --> 00:05:17,173
When you're in a
public restroom,

119
00:05:17,175 --> 00:05:19,576
which foot do you
flush the toilet with?

120
00:05:21,612 --> 00:05:23,947
Right. Always right.

121
00:05:23,949 --> 00:05:25,248
He's a righty.

122
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:27,817
Okay,

123
00:05:27,819 --> 00:05:28,918
show me en garde.

124
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:31,254
Good. Knees bent,

125
00:05:31,256 --> 00:05:32,922
slightly over the toe.

126
00:05:32,924 --> 00:05:35,625
Non-sword hand up for balance.

127
00:05:35,627 --> 00:05:39,595
(groans) I am going
to feel this tomorrow.

128
00:05:39,597 --> 00:05:42,799
The first move
is called an advance.

129
00:05:42,801 --> 00:05:45,268
You move your front foot
forward, heel to toe.

130
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:47,270
Back foot
follows.

131
00:05:47,272 --> 00:05:49,672
So front foot forward,
heel to toe.

132
00:05:49,674 --> 00:05:51,407
Back foot follows.

133
00:05:51,409 --> 00:05:54,076
Now you try. Advance.

134
00:05:54,078 --> 00:05:57,647
And advance.
And advance.

135
00:05:57,649 --> 00:06:01,017
This is easy.
I didn't need to wear a cup.

136
00:06:01,019 --> 00:06:02,051
KRIPKE:
Good.

137
00:06:02,053 --> 00:06:03,819
The next move is called
a retreat.

138
00:06:03,821 --> 00:06:04,920
Step back.

139
00:06:04,922 --> 00:06:06,922
Back foot first, toe to heel.

140
00:06:06,924 --> 00:06:08,591
Front foot follows.

141
00:06:08,593 --> 00:06:10,226
On three.

142
00:06:10,228 --> 00:06:11,460
Excuse me, Barry?
Yes.

143
00:06:11,462 --> 00:06:13,829
When can I stab
one of my friends?

144
00:06:14,965 --> 00:06:16,699
In fencing,
we don't call it a stab.

145
00:06:16,701 --> 00:06:18,467
We call it a touch.
Uh, yes, I'm aware.

146
00:06:18,469 --> 00:06:20,336
But if I say I want
to touch one of my friends,

147
00:06:20,338 --> 00:06:23,372
I'll get called
into Human Resources.

148
00:06:23,374 --> 00:06:24,840
Okay, on three,

149
00:06:24,842 --> 00:06:28,310
Cooper and Koothrappali advance,
the other two retreat.

150
00:06:28,312 --> 00:06:31,980
One, two, three.

151
00:06:31,982 --> 00:06:33,682
Very good. Switch it up.

152
00:06:33,684 --> 00:06:35,651
One, two, three.

153
00:06:35,653 --> 00:06:38,287
Switch again.
One, two, three.

154
00:06:38,289 --> 00:06:40,656
(phone rings)
(groans)

155
00:06:40,658 --> 00:06:42,324
Excuse me.

156
00:06:42,326 --> 00:06:44,092
Can I call you back?

157
00:06:44,094 --> 00:06:47,663
No, I'm teaching
a class.

158
00:06:47,665 --> 00:06:50,299
Sure.
Sure.

159
00:06:50,301 --> 00:06:52,534
An hour,
tops.

160
00:06:52,536 --> 00:06:53,969
Yeah. Okay.

161
00:06:53,971 --> 00:06:56,038
Okay.
Yeah.

162
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:58,006
Okay. Thanks.

163
00:06:58,008 --> 00:07:01,877
And one,
two, three.

164
00:07:03,046 --> 00:07:06,481
Have you thought about
advertising directly to females?

165
00:07:06,483 --> 00:07:08,483
Hmm, okay.

166
00:07:08,485 --> 00:07:10,218
Well... All right.

167
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:13,255
What if I put up a sign
in the window that said,

168
00:07:13,257 --> 00:07:16,091
"Women, come in.

169
00:07:16,093 --> 00:07:19,594
Don't be afraid."

170
00:07:22,198 --> 00:07:24,399
PENNY:
Hey.

171
00:07:24,401 --> 00:07:26,534
Uh, have you read the online
reviews for this place?

172
00:07:26,536 --> 00:07:27,569
Eh,

173
00:07:27,571 --> 00:07:28,536
the Internet's so negative.

174
00:07:28,538 --> 00:07:30,071
I try to avoid it.

175
00:07:30,073 --> 00:07:31,306
All right, well,
Heather H. says,

176
00:07:31,308 --> 00:07:33,208
"The owner stared at me
the whole time

177
00:07:33,210 --> 00:07:35,844
and didn't blink once."

178
00:07:44,253 --> 00:07:45,987
Kelly M. says,

179
00:07:45,989 --> 00:07:48,623
"The creepy guy who runs it
asked me out,

180
00:07:48,625 --> 00:07:52,193
then called himself stupid
before I could say no."

181
00:07:53,229 --> 00:07:56,130
Jessica K.
says,

182
00:07:56,132 --> 00:07:58,566
"I told the weird owner
that I liked his shirt.

183
00:07:58,568 --> 00:08:02,303
He took it off
and gave it to me."

184
00:08:02,305 --> 00:08:06,107
See? Negative.

185
00:08:08,410 --> 00:08:10,011
With your foil extended,

186
00:08:10,013 --> 00:08:13,114
kick your front leg up and
push off with your back leg.

187
00:08:13,116 --> 00:08:14,882
Now you try.

188
00:08:15,651 --> 00:08:18,319
And
again.

189
00:08:18,321 --> 00:08:21,222
And again.

190
00:08:21,224 --> 00:08:24,392
Look at us! We're
like the Rockettes!

191
00:08:25,193 --> 00:08:26,961
En garde,
Leonard.

192
00:08:26,963 --> 00:08:30,264
Prepare yourself
for a rigorous touching.

193
00:08:33,168 --> 00:08:35,036
(Spanish accent):
My name is Inigo Montoya.

194
00:08:35,038 --> 00:08:36,904
You killed my father.

195
00:08:36,906 --> 00:08:38,472
Prepare to die.

196
00:08:38,474 --> 00:08:40,141
(Spanish accent):
<i>My</i> name

197
00:08:40,143 --> 00:08:41,175
is Inigo Montoya.

198
00:08:41,177 --> 00:08:43,611
You killed<i> my</i>
father. Prepare

199
00:08:43,613 --> 00:08:45,212
to die.

200
00:08:45,214 --> 00:08:47,548
I thought
you were Puss in Boots.

201
00:08:47,550 --> 00:08:48,782
Oh, yeah, right. Sorry.

202
00:08:48,784 --> 00:08:50,918
(Spanish accent):
My name is Puss in Boots.

203
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:52,686
You killed my father.

204
00:08:52,688 --> 00:08:54,421
Prepare to die.

205
00:08:56,625 --> 00:08:59,660
I'm looking forward to him
teaching us glove-slapping.

206
00:08:59,662 --> 00:09:01,462
What?

207
00:09:01,464 --> 00:09:04,031
You know, when my
honor is insulted,

208
00:09:04,033 --> 00:09:06,166
and I need to challenge
someone to a duel

209
00:09:06,168 --> 00:09:10,003
by slapping them across
the face with my glove.

210
00:09:10,005 --> 00:09:11,371
When was your honor insulted?

211
00:09:11,373 --> 00:09:14,975
My last physical.

212
00:09:14,977 --> 00:09:17,311
Again, that doctor
didn't insult your honor.

213
00:09:17,313 --> 00:09:19,480
Just checked your prostate.

214
00:09:20,949 --> 00:09:24,084
My name is Little
Orphan Annie.

215
00:09:24,086 --> 00:09:25,953
You killed my father.

216
00:09:25,955 --> 00:09:28,322
Prepare to die.

217
00:09:30,425 --> 00:09:33,560
(with accent):
My name is Darth Vader.

218
00:09:33,562 --> 00:09:36,663
I<i> am</i> your father. Ah!

219
00:09:38,366 --> 00:09:40,667
This is fun.
Good.

220
00:09:40,669 --> 00:09:42,702
It's nice
to see your mind off Amy.

221
00:09:42,704 --> 00:09:44,137
What's going on with Amy?

222
00:09:44,139 --> 00:09:45,806
Not that it's any
of your business,

223
00:09:45,808 --> 00:09:47,207
but she broke up with me.

224
00:09:47,209 --> 00:09:48,708
Really?

225
00:09:48,710 --> 00:09:50,410
Good to know.

226
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:54,381
"Good to know"?

227
00:09:54,383 --> 00:09:56,216
What's that supposed to mean?
Oh.

228
00:09:56,218 --> 00:09:59,419
I hate to say it, but it sounds
like he's interested in her.

229
00:09:59,421 --> 00:10:02,455
Well, that's unacceptable.

230
00:10:02,457 --> 00:10:04,624
Oh, buddy, I get
that you don't like it,

231
00:10:04,626 --> 00:10:06,459
but it's not
really up to you.

232
00:10:06,461 --> 00:10:09,629
Yeah, but he's dumb,
and his face is dumb.

233
00:10:09,631 --> 00:10:12,899
Look, even if it's not him,

234
00:10:12,901 --> 00:10:16,402
Amy's probably going
to date someone at some point.

235
00:10:16,404 --> 00:10:18,037
You really think so?

236
00:10:18,039 --> 00:10:20,707
Of course.
She deserves to be happy.

237
00:10:20,709 --> 00:10:23,476
How dare you!

238
00:10:33,098 --> 00:10:34,732
Listen, I should warn you

239
00:10:34,734 --> 00:10:38,569
that maybe asking Amy out
isn't a good idea.

240
00:10:38,571 --> 00:10:39,970
Barry, a word?

241
00:10:39,972 --> 00:10:42,573
And now the crazy version
of what I just said.

242
00:10:44,276 --> 00:10:45,543
If you intend to pursue Amy,

243
00:10:45,545 --> 00:10:48,312
you leave me with no choice
but to put a stop to it.

244
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:51,048
And how are you gonna do that?

245
00:10:51,050 --> 00:10:52,750
By challenging you to a duel.

246
00:10:53,785 --> 00:10:56,854
You've had one lesson.
I'll destroy you.

247
00:10:56,856 --> 00:10:59,023
That is why
the duel will take place

248
00:10:59,025 --> 00:11:01,992
at high noon,
three years from today.

249
00:11:03,561 --> 00:11:05,396
If you're worth your salt
as an instructor,

250
00:11:05,398 --> 00:11:06,630
I should be ready by then.

251
00:11:06,632 --> 00:11:08,699
Yeah, and be warned.

252
00:11:08,701 --> 00:11:10,734
I'm going to touch you all over.

253
00:11:13,104 --> 00:11:18,408
Wow. That-that was crazier
than I thought.

254
00:11:19,544 --> 00:11:22,412
All right,
I'm not saying

255
00:11:22,414 --> 00:11:24,815
it's true, but let's-let's
consider for a moment

256
00:11:24,817 --> 00:11:27,284
that possibly I'm the problem.
Yeah.

257
00:11:27,286 --> 00:11:28,552
You are.
You can say it.

258
00:11:28,554 --> 00:11:30,120
Okay, fine. What...?

259
00:11:30,122 --> 00:11:31,655
I mean, what
can I do?

260
00:11:31,657 --> 00:11:33,457
I get so nervous
around women.

261
00:11:33,459 --> 00:11:34,925
Well, you're talking
to us now.

262
00:11:34,927 --> 00:11:36,360
I mean, you don't seem nervous.

263
00:11:36,362 --> 00:11:37,961
Well, that's
'cause I'm doing that trick

264
00:11:37,963 --> 00:11:40,597
where you imagine
the audience is naked.

265
00:11:42,667 --> 00:11:45,202
By the way, thumbs up, ladies.

266
00:11:46,270 --> 00:11:48,772
Do you not hear
how creepy that sounds?

267
00:11:48,774 --> 00:11:50,707
(laughing):
It was a joke.

268
00:11:50,709 --> 00:11:51,875
Was it?

269
00:11:51,877 --> 00:11:53,677
No, I'm still doing it.

270
00:11:53,679 --> 00:11:56,580
Okay.

271
00:11:56,582 --> 00:11:58,548
Don't be offended, but...

272
00:11:58,550 --> 00:12:00,884
what went wrong with you?

273
00:12:00,886 --> 00:12:05,422
I-I guess I assumed
at this point in my life,

274
00:12:05,424 --> 00:12:08,558
I would be married
or in a relationship,

275
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:09,993
or even have a pet

276
00:12:09,995 --> 00:12:12,695
that didn't run away
or kill itself.

277
00:12:13,564 --> 00:12:15,465
That really happened?

278
00:12:15,467 --> 00:12:17,801
I mean, I can't say for sure,
but I swear

279
00:12:17,803 --> 00:12:19,669
that rabbit looked me
right in the eye

280
00:12:19,671 --> 00:12:21,804
before it hopped
in front of that car.

281
00:12:21,806 --> 00:12:23,673
Anyway,

282
00:12:23,675 --> 00:12:25,909
the longer I'm alone,
the more desperate I get.

283
00:12:25,911 --> 00:12:31,347
Stuart, believe it or not,
I understand.

284
00:12:31,349 --> 00:12:32,882
You know, before I met Sheldon,

285
00:12:32,884 --> 00:12:35,518
I was alone
for a really long time.

286
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:37,420
I was so desperate

287
00:12:37,422 --> 00:12:39,789
for people to like me,
when I met these guys,

288
00:12:39,791 --> 00:12:43,059
it took everything in my power
to hide my insecurity.

289
00:12:46,063 --> 00:12:48,197
(laughing):
Okay, we're all feeling it.

290
00:12:48,199 --> 00:12:50,433
Yes, I'll go out with you.

291
00:12:53,704 --> 00:12:56,973
Suddenly, the rabbit thing
makes sense.

292
00:12:59,610 --> 00:13:02,511
I'm surprised you wanted to go
to a sports bar, Sheldon.

293
00:13:02,513 --> 00:13:04,981
Look at this blister.

294
00:13:04,983 --> 00:13:07,483
Like it or not,
we're athletes now.

295
00:13:07,485 --> 00:13:10,720
Besides, a bar is
where I belong.

296
00:13:10,722 --> 00:13:12,922
I'm having female problems.

297
00:13:12,924 --> 00:13:15,724
If you're cranky and retaining
water, I have a theory.

298
00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:19,929
Sheldon, instead of focusing
on Amy dating other guys,

299
00:13:19,931 --> 00:13:22,464
maybe you should start thinking
about dating another girl.

300
00:13:22,466 --> 00:13:24,633
That's ridiculous.

301
00:13:24,635 --> 00:13:25,935
KOOTHRAPPALI:
Why? You never thought

302
00:13:25,937 --> 00:13:27,202
you'd end up in a relationship,

303
00:13:27,204 --> 00:13:28,370
and then you met Amy.

304
00:13:28,372 --> 00:13:29,838
Maybe there's someone else
out there for you.

305
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:33,976
True, but Penny's married,
and so is Bernadette.

306
00:13:35,178 --> 00:13:37,379
And your girlfriend has
red hair and white skin,

307
00:13:37,381 --> 00:13:40,549
which really rubs up
against my clown phobia.

308
00:13:41,851 --> 00:13:43,452
Maybe you should consider women

309
00:13:43,454 --> 00:13:44,820
who aren't
in serious relationships

310
00:13:44,822 --> 00:13:46,388
with your closest friends?

311
00:13:46,390 --> 00:13:49,925
There's that prostate doctor,
but I'm still mad at her.

312
00:13:52,128 --> 00:13:53,729
Oh, there's a woman.

313
00:13:53,731 --> 00:13:55,130
Oh, I'll make her my girlfriend.

314
00:13:55,132 --> 00:13:57,799
Whoa, whoa.

315
00:13:57,801 --> 00:14:01,937
Walking up to a strange woman
in a bar usually doesn't work.

316
00:14:01,939 --> 00:14:03,839
You're forgetting something.

317
00:14:03,841 --> 00:14:05,407
Ladies love jocks.

318
00:14:06,309 --> 00:14:08,577
How many sips
of that beer did he have?

319
00:14:08,579 --> 00:14:10,445
Three.
Oh, boy.

320
00:14:12,081 --> 00:14:16,852
Excuse me. I'm recovering
from a recent breakup,

321
00:14:16,854 --> 00:14:20,655
and I'm told asking out another
woman might make me feel better.

322
00:14:20,657 --> 00:14:24,860
And as Ash Ketchum said
to Pikachu, "I choose you."

323
00:14:24,862 --> 00:14:26,828
What?

324
00:14:26,830 --> 00:14:28,997
It's a<i> Pok?mon</i> reference.

325
00:14:28,999 --> 00:14:30,699
I don't know what that means.

326
00:14:30,701 --> 00:14:32,834
Well, we gave it a shot.

327
00:14:33,502 --> 00:14:36,237
How about you?

328
00:14:36,239 --> 00:14:39,441
I'm married,
and I'm her grandmother.

329
00:14:39,443 --> 00:14:42,277
Ah, what might have been.

330
00:14:42,279 --> 00:14:46,347
And you, give my regards
to Barnum and Bailey.

331
00:14:49,485 --> 00:14:52,821
Stuart took that rejection
like a pro.

332
00:14:52,823 --> 00:14:55,690
Well, he knew
he was on the breast cam.

333
00:14:57,593 --> 00:15:00,328
I don't have much practice
turning men down.

334
00:15:00,330 --> 00:15:01,863
It wasn't so much fun.

335
00:15:01,865 --> 00:15:03,197
Oh, you get used to it.

336
00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:05,466
Some guys you have
to turn down over and over.

337
00:15:05,468 --> 00:15:08,169
And sometimes
we marry them anyway.

338
00:15:08,171 --> 00:15:10,171
(phone chimes)

339
00:15:10,173 --> 00:15:12,407
Huh.

340
00:15:12,409 --> 00:15:14,642
Well, this is weird.

341
00:15:14,644 --> 00:15:17,712
What?
Barry Kripke just asked me out.

342
00:15:17,714 --> 00:15:19,080
(gasps)
BERNADETTE: Oh.

343
00:15:19,082 --> 00:15:21,449
Look at you--
two guys in one day!

344
00:15:21,451 --> 00:15:25,186
I told you things would change
if you plucked your eyebrows!

345
00:15:26,622 --> 00:15:28,356
What did he say?

346
00:15:28,358 --> 00:15:30,825
"Hi, how are you?
I was wondering

347
00:15:30,827 --> 00:15:33,761
if you'd like to get a drink
after work sometime."

348
00:15:33,763 --> 00:15:35,396
Well, what are
you gonna do?

349
00:15:35,398 --> 00:15:37,298
I don't know.

350
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:40,368
I guess I assumed that I would
eventually date other people,

351
00:15:40,370 --> 00:15:42,603
but this is happening so fast.

352
00:15:42,605 --> 00:15:44,205
What can it hurt?

353
00:15:44,207 --> 00:15:46,207
Well, I was hoping the
next person I dated

354
00:15:46,209 --> 00:15:48,175
would be a little
less like Sheldon.

355
00:15:48,177 --> 00:15:49,877
You mean, not a scientist?

356
00:15:49,879 --> 00:15:51,946
I think she means not a weirdo.

357
00:15:53,181 --> 00:15:54,582
Are you attracted
to him?

358
00:15:54,584 --> 00:15:56,817
I don't know.

359
00:15:56,819 --> 00:15:59,620
All right, well, what happens
if you imagine him naked?

360
00:15:59,622 --> 00:16:00,821
Oh, I don't have to imagine it.

361
00:16:00,823 --> 00:16:03,223
(gasps)

362
00:16:08,463 --> 00:16:10,331
I smell funny.

363
00:16:12,167 --> 00:16:14,435
I taste salty.

364
00:16:14,437 --> 00:16:17,504
You're just sweaty
from exercise.

365
00:16:17,506 --> 00:16:19,006
And kind of delicious.

366
00:16:20,909 --> 00:16:24,444
I wonder how many licks it would
take to get to the center of me.

367
00:16:27,282 --> 00:16:29,750
I know it only takes
one doctor's finger.

368
00:16:32,687 --> 00:16:34,121
Hello.

369
00:16:34,123 --> 00:16:35,789
Hello.

370
00:16:35,791 --> 00:16:37,391
We should let
you guys talk.

371
00:16:37,393 --> 00:16:38,325
Yeah.

372
00:16:38,327 --> 00:16:39,626
You don't have to leave.

373
00:16:39,628 --> 00:16:41,461
Look at me go!

374
00:16:43,464 --> 00:16:44,765
Uh, Bernadette,
you're my ride.

375
00:16:44,767 --> 00:16:46,032
BERNADETTE:
Walk!

376
00:16:50,271 --> 00:16:52,672
How have you been?

377
00:16:52,674 --> 00:16:54,641
I'm doing all right.

378
00:16:54,643 --> 00:16:56,977
I tried fencing today.

379
00:16:56,979 --> 00:16:58,778
How'd that go?

380
00:16:58,780 --> 00:17:01,414
It was pretty easy.

381
00:17:01,416 --> 00:17:03,984
And I think my background
in "mathletics" helped.

382
00:17:05,653 --> 00:17:07,954
Barry Kripke was there.

383
00:17:07,956 --> 00:17:09,222
I should let you know

384
00:17:09,224 --> 00:17:12,158
that he expressed interest
in asking you out.

385
00:17:13,361 --> 00:17:15,061
Well, actually,
he-he already did.

386
00:17:15,063 --> 00:17:17,030
Okay.

387
00:17:17,032 --> 00:17:18,798
But don't get
too attached to him.

388
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:21,935
In two years, 364 days,
he's a dead man.

389
00:17:25,239 --> 00:17:26,573
I said no.

390
00:17:26,575 --> 00:17:28,174
Interesting.

391
00:17:28,176 --> 00:17:32,345
I asked two women out today,
and they both said no.

392
00:17:32,347 --> 00:17:35,748
I didn't know you
were interested in dating.

393
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:39,018
I've been told
it's a good way to move on.

394
00:17:39,020 --> 00:17:41,354
Oh.

395
00:17:41,356 --> 00:17:43,222
Okay.

396
00:17:45,693 --> 00:17:49,395
Anyway, um,
it's nice to see you.

397
00:17:49,397 --> 00:17:50,997
You look good.

398
00:17:50,999 --> 00:17:51,998
Mmm, thanks.

399
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,399
And I taste good too.

400
00:18:05,070 --> 00:18:07,305
Howie?

401
00:18:07,555 --> 00:18:09,122
What's up?

402
00:18:09,959 --> 00:18:12,760
Why does your Fitbit say
you ran 174 miles yesterday?

403
00:18:16,659 --> 00:18:23,159
