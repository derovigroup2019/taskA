1
00:00:02,383 --> 00:00:04,383
Did you hear about this study
that found people

2
00:00:04,385 --> 00:00:06,986
that were cool and popular
at 13

3
00:00:06,988 --> 00:00:08,721
have problems succeeding
later in life?

4
00:00:08,723 --> 00:00:11,157
Hmm. I'm doing okay,
and I was very popular at 13.

5
00:00:11,159 --> 00:00:12,291
In school?

6
00:00:12,293 --> 00:00:13,959
Oh, no. At home.

7
00:00:14,729 --> 00:00:15,928
The servants would sing to me,

8
00:00:15,930 --> 00:00:17,830
laugh at my jokes...

9
00:00:18,633 --> 00:00:22,134
I wish I knew their names.

10
00:00:22,136 --> 00:00:25,104
Does the study say what happens
to the unpopular kids?

11
00:00:25,106 --> 00:00:27,573
You tell me-- you woke up
in bed with one.

12
00:00:28,709 --> 00:00:30,543
Listen to this.

13
00:00:30,545 --> 00:00:33,245
I just received an e-mail
from Wil Wheaton.

14
00:00:33,247 --> 00:00:36,248
Leonard Nimoy's son is
working on a documentary

15
00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:38,517
that he started with his
father before he passed away.

16
00:00:38,519 --> 00:00:40,719
It's about Mr. Spock and
his impact on our culture.

17
00:00:40,721 --> 00:00:41,687
Hmm.

18
00:00:41,689 --> 00:00:42,922
Why is he writing to you?

19
00:00:42,924 --> 00:00:44,924
Well, they're looking
for fans to interview,

20
00:00:44,926 --> 00:00:46,692
and Wil thought
I'd be good for it.

21
00:00:46,694 --> 00:00:47,760
Oh. Hey, high five.

22
00:00:47,762 --> 00:00:49,161
Absolutely not.

23
00:00:50,798 --> 00:00:51,764
Yeah, Penny,

24
00:00:51,766 --> 00:00:52,932
you spent some time
in front

25
00:00:52,934 --> 00:00:55,267
of the camera.
Any words of advice?

26
00:00:55,269 --> 00:00:56,569
Yes. Don't take your shirt off

27
00:00:56,571 --> 00:00:58,971
just because the director
said so.

28
00:00:58,973 --> 00:01:01,207
This is a documentary
about Mr. Spock.

29
00:01:01,209 --> 00:01:04,677
I'm sure if there's nudity,
it will be tasteful.

30
00:01:05,746 --> 00:01:09,381
? Our whole universe
was in a hot, dense state ?

31
00:01:09,383 --> 00:01:12,718
? Then nearly 14 billion years
ago expansion started... Wait! ?

32
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:14,353
? The Earth began to cool ?

33
00:01:14,355 --> 00:01:16,889
? The autotrophs began to drool,
Neanderthals developed tools ?

34
00:01:16,891 --> 00:01:19,558
? We built the Wall ?
?<i> We built the pyramids</i> ?

35
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:22,228
? Math, Science, History,
unraveling the mystery ?

36
00:01:22,230 --> 00:01:24,129
? That all started
with a big bang ?

37
00:01:24,131 --> 00:01:26,098
?<i> Bang!</i> ?

(sword fight sound effects

41
00:01:38,867 --> 00:01:40,433
Hey. You got a minute?

42
00:01:40,435 --> 00:01:41,568
Not really.

43
00:01:41,570 --> 00:01:44,904
Visigoths are kind of up my butt
right now.

44
00:01:44,906 --> 00:01:46,840
Pause the game, Howard.

45
00:01:46,842 --> 00:01:48,408
“Howard”? Uh-oh.

46
00:01:48,410 --> 00:01:51,010
Make room, Visigoths.

47
00:01:51,546 --> 00:01:53,213
'Sup?

48
00:01:53,215 --> 00:01:55,455
We need to talk
about redecorating this place.

49
00:01:55,456 --> 00:01:58,385
Oh, no, not this again.
Look,

50
00:01:58,386 --> 00:02:01,387
I get that you grew up here
and you're attached to things

51
00:02:01,389 --> 00:02:02,722
looking
a certain way, but...

52
00:02:02,724 --> 00:02:05,363
I want this to feel
like my house, too.

53
00:02:05,364 --> 00:02:07,995
Oh, honey, of course
it's your house.

54
00:02:07,996 --> 00:02:11,197
Why else would you
be cleaning it all the time?

55
00:02:11,199 --> 00:02:13,366
(chuckles)

56
00:02:13,368 --> 00:02:15,268
All right.
Let's start over.

57
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:16,569
I'm redecorating.

58
00:02:16,571 --> 00:02:18,705
The furniture,
the carpeting, the walls.

59
00:02:18,707 --> 00:02:21,541
I'm changing everything that
depresses me when I look at it.

60
00:02:21,543 --> 00:02:23,610
Try not to be one
of those things.

61
00:02:24,479 --> 00:02:26,179
May I say something?

62
00:02:26,181 --> 00:02:28,214
Is it about how I can't have
new wallpaper

63
00:02:28,216 --> 00:02:30,617
'cause your dad left when you
were little and your mom died?

64
00:02:30,619 --> 00:02:32,385
Never mind.

65
00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:37,390
Hello, Amy. It's Sheldon.

66
00:02:37,392 --> 00:02:39,692
Yeah, I-I know
that we're broken up, but

67
00:02:39,694 --> 00:02:41,995
I'm leaving this message because
I thought perhaps you'd like

68
00:02:41,997 --> 00:02:45,665
to watch me be interviewed for
a documentary about Mr. Spock.

69
00:02:45,667 --> 00:02:49,435
Or as I like to call it,
a Spockumentary.

70
00:02:49,437 --> 00:02:50,803
Yeah, I'm going to use

71
00:02:50,805 --> 00:02:52,906
that joke in the interview,
so try to laugh

72
00:02:52,908 --> 00:02:55,174
like you're hearing it
for the first time.

73
00:02:55,176 --> 00:02:56,976
You know, hysterically, hmm?

74
00:02:56,978 --> 00:03:00,880
And with a tinge of sadness
that I'm no longer in your life.

75
00:03:00,882 --> 00:03:03,449
I'm the one who thought
of “Spockumentary”"

76
00:03:03,451 --> 00:03:05,919
And I'm laughing like I did
the first time I heard it.

77
00:03:05,921 --> 00:03:08,655
(knocking on door)

78
00:03:09,991 --> 00:03:10,990
Hello.

79
00:03:10,992 --> 00:03:12,058
Hey, Sheldon.

80
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:13,192
This is Adam Nimoy.

81
00:03:13,194 --> 00:03:15,628
Nice to meet you.
Oh, it's nice to meet you.

82
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:17,997
I admire your father's work
very much.

83
00:03:17,999 --> 00:03:20,800
It's not every day I get to meet
someone whose life's journey

84
00:03:20,802 --> 00:03:23,303
began in my hero's scrotum.

85
00:03:25,574 --> 00:03:28,508
I told you.
This guy is gold.

86
00:03:32,948 --> 00:03:34,347
Whatcha doing?
Oh!

87
00:03:34,349 --> 00:03:36,983
Making myself a bologna sandwich
like my mom used to make me

88
00:03:36,985 --> 00:03:39,586
after my dad left,
but before she died.

89
00:03:44,125 --> 00:03:45,224
Okay, listen, I'm thinking

90
00:03:45,226 --> 00:03:47,627
that maybe we can compromise
on the house.

91
00:03:47,629 --> 00:03:50,163
I'm listening.

92
00:03:50,165 --> 00:03:53,132
Let's just redo one room
and see how it goes.

93
00:03:53,134 --> 00:03:54,500
That is reasonable.

94
00:03:54,502 --> 00:03:56,402
But what room?

95
00:03:56,404 --> 00:03:58,004
How 'bout this one?

96
00:03:58,006 --> 00:04:02,709
No way. No, this is the room I
associate the most with my mom.

97
00:04:02,711 --> 00:04:04,644
Then how 'bout the bathroom?

98
00:04:04,646 --> 00:04:07,513
I want to change my answer.

99
00:04:07,515 --> 00:04:10,216
Fine. Then the dining room.

100
00:04:10,218 --> 00:04:12,852
I guess we didn't use it
very often.

101
00:04:12,854 --> 00:04:14,220
Unless we had company.

102
00:04:14,222 --> 00:04:16,756
Which didn't happen much
after my dad left and not at all

103
00:04:16,758 --> 00:04:17,470
after my mom...

104
00:04:17,494 --> 00:04:19,174
Great! I'm gonna go
pick out paint samples.

105
00:04:21,896 --> 00:04:24,030
All right, we're just gonna
have a conversation.

106
00:04:24,032 --> 00:04:26,366
Pretend the
camera's not here.

107
00:04:26,368 --> 00:04:28,501
All right.
But this better not be

108
00:04:28,503 --> 00:04:31,104
some elaborate scheme
to get me out of my shirt.

109
00:04:33,174 --> 00:04:34,540
How long have
you known Adam?

110
00:04:34,542 --> 00:04:35,975
A few years.
Mm-hmm.

111
00:04:35,977 --> 00:04:39,112
And what are you
getting him back for?

112
00:04:40,015 --> 00:04:41,748
Let's start with your
name and occupation.

113
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:45,785
Dr. Sheldon Cooper,
theoretical physicist, Caltech.

114
00:04:45,787 --> 00:04:49,656
And what is your earliest memory
of the character Spock?

115
00:04:49,658 --> 00:04:54,293
The first episode of<i> Star Trek:</i>
<i>The Original Series</i> I ever saw

116
00:04:54,295 --> 00:04:56,295
was “The<i> Galileo</i> Seven.”

117
00:04:56,297 --> 00:04:59,732
Uh, Spock had just landed
on the planet Taurus II.

118
00:04:59,734 --> 00:05:02,268
Then my brother came in,
sat on my head,

119
00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:04,971
and said, “Eat farts.”

120
00:05:06,241 --> 00:05:07,740
After that day, I was hooked.

121
00:05:07,742 --> 00:05:09,442
On<i> Star Trek,</i>

122
00:05:09,444 --> 00:05:12,478
not my brother's
sphincter-based cuisine.

123
00:05:14,015 --> 00:05:16,916
What was it about Spock
that appealed to you?

124
00:05:16,918 --> 00:05:19,986
I think the same thing that
appeals to people everywhere,

125
00:05:19,988 --> 00:05:22,955
the dream
of a cold, rational world

126
00:05:22,957 --> 00:05:25,091
entirely without human emotion.

127
00:05:25,093 --> 00:05:27,060
Spock came

128
00:05:27,062 --> 00:05:29,095
from a planet governed
only by logic.

129
00:05:29,097 --> 00:05:31,364
You know, on Vulcan,
when your brother asks,

130
00:05:31,366 --> 00:05:33,900
“Why are you hitting yourself?”
the answer is,

131
00:05:33,902 --> 00:05:35,268
“I'm not.

132
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:37,103
You're moving my arm.”

133
00:05:38,707 --> 00:05:39,639
To which he says,

134
00:05:39,641 --> 00:05:41,007
“Fascinating.”

135
00:05:41,009 --> 00:05:44,844
And then you both watch
educational television.

136
00:05:44,846 --> 00:05:46,646
(quietly): Aw. When he says
things like that,

137
00:05:46,648 --> 00:05:48,815
I just want to hug him
and make everything better.

138
00:05:48,817 --> 00:05:50,850
My brother was
mean to me, too.

139
00:05:50,852 --> 00:05:52,518
Yeah, you probably
had it coming.

140
00:05:54,723 --> 00:05:56,589
Do you have
any Spock collectibles?

141
00:05:56,591 --> 00:05:57,657
I have many.

142
00:05:57,659 --> 00:06:00,093
My most treasured
is an autographed napkin

143
00:06:00,095 --> 00:06:02,829
given to me by my
very thoughtful friend Penny.

144
00:06:02,831 --> 00:06:04,163
That's her over there.

145
00:06:06,401 --> 00:06:08,601
Hi!

146
00:06:09,304 --> 00:06:10,636
Look at that.

147
00:06:10,638 --> 00:06:14,273
I'm in a movie,
my shirt stayed on.

148
00:06:14,275 --> 00:06:16,008
Can we see the napkin?

149
00:06:16,010 --> 00:06:17,477
Of course. Excuse me.

150
00:06:17,479 --> 00:06:18,978
This will just take a moment.

152
00:06:30,525 --> 00:06:33,392
When did we get
a wall safe?

153
00:06:33,394 --> 00:06:37,730
When there was no more room
in the floor safe.

154
00:06:37,732 --> 00:06:40,533
When did we get
a floor safe?

155
00:06:40,535 --> 00:06:43,503
When we got the security camera.

156
00:06:43,505 --> 00:06:45,738
There's a
security camera?

157
00:06:46,708 --> 00:06:49,675
Aquaman, protecting your home
since 2012.

158
00:06:51,646 --> 00:06:54,680
Oh, my God.
We've done things on that couch.

159
00:06:54,682 --> 00:06:56,516
Yeah. You don't have to tell me.

160
00:06:59,154 --> 00:07:01,454
So, your father-in-law
is in there right now?

161
00:07:01,456 --> 00:07:02,688
Yes. So back me up.

162
00:07:02,690 --> 00:07:04,991
The house is good the way it is.
Oh, okay. Got it.

163
00:07:06,427 --> 00:07:07,760
Hey. What's going on?

164
00:07:07,762 --> 00:07:09,228
Hey.
Hey, Raj.

165
00:07:09,230 --> 00:07:11,764
Dad and I were just talking
about taking down this wall.

166
00:07:11,766 --> 00:07:16,536
You sure? It's a...
pretty great wall.

167
00:07:16,538 --> 00:07:18,271
What's so great about it?

168
00:07:19,307 --> 00:07:21,340
I'm sorry.
I did what I could.

169
00:07:22,710 --> 00:07:25,545
Seriously? You brought Raj over
to take your side?

170
00:07:25,547 --> 00:07:27,213
Your dad's on your side.

171
00:07:27,215 --> 00:07:29,682
He's not on my side. He's doing
all the work for free.

172
00:07:29,684 --> 00:07:32,585
That is so
generous of you.

173
00:07:32,587 --> 00:07:36,589
I'd like to switch sides.

174
00:07:36,591 --> 00:07:37,857
Look, uh...

175
00:07:37,859 --> 00:07:39,458
I don't even think
you can take this wall down

176
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:40,660
'cause it's load-bearing.

177
00:07:40,662 --> 00:07:41,928
Well, it's easy to find out.

178
00:07:41,930 --> 00:07:44,130
Just go into the crawlspace
under the house and check.

179
00:07:44,132 --> 00:07:46,866
When is your visa up?

180
00:07:49,637 --> 00:07:52,338
Not only is it signed to me

181
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:54,173
but this is where he wiped
his mouth.

182
00:07:54,175 --> 00:07:58,644
So we are currently in the
presence of Leonard Nimoy's DNA.

183
00:07:58,646 --> 00:08:02,114
Um, doesn't Adam count
as Leonard Nimoy's DNA?

184
00:08:02,116 --> 00:08:06,052
No offense, but this is
pure 100% Nimoy.

185
00:08:06,054 --> 00:08:08,855
Because of your mother,
you're only 50%.

186
00:08:08,857 --> 00:08:11,424
Which isn't bad,

187
00:08:11,426 --> 00:08:15,261
but anything that you wipe
your mouth on gets thrown away.

188
00:08:16,397 --> 00:08:17,597
Okay, enough
about the napkin.

189
00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:18,631
What else you
hiding in there?

190
00:08:18,633 --> 00:08:19,899
Wouldn't you like
to know?

191
00:08:19,901 --> 00:08:21,567
I would.
All right then.

192
00:08:22,437 --> 00:08:23,502
See? Just my valuables.

193
00:08:23,504 --> 00:08:27,273
My passport, uh, my will...
You have a will?

194
00:08:27,275 --> 00:08:29,909
Yeah-- my 1/18 scale
Wil Wheaton action figure.

195
00:08:31,479 --> 00:08:33,145
I also have the other kind
of will,

196
00:08:33,147 --> 00:08:37,350
and in it I will my Wil
back to Wil.

197
00:08:37,352 --> 00:08:38,317
Will Wil want it?

198
00:08:38,319 --> 00:08:39,752
Wil won't.

199
00:08:40,421 --> 00:08:42,121
What's that ring box?

200
00:08:42,123 --> 00:08:43,189
Oh. That is

201
00:08:43,191 --> 00:08:44,490
an engagement ring

202
00:08:44,492 --> 00:08:46,692
that I was going to give
my girlfriend Amy.

203
00:08:46,694 --> 00:08:48,494
What?!

204
00:08:49,998 --> 00:08:51,631
You bought her a ring?

205
00:08:51,633 --> 00:08:52,665
No, no, no. This has been
in my family

206
00:08:52,667 --> 00:08:55,668
for generations.
Except for a short time

207
00:08:55,670 --> 00:08:58,137
when Comanches cut off my
great-great-great-grandmother's

208
00:08:58,139 --> 00:09:00,306
finger and stole it.

209
00:09:00,722 --> 00:09:02,555
Sheldon, that's awful.
No.

210
00:09:02,557 --> 00:09:04,757
The Texas Rangers tracked them
down to their village

211
00:09:04,759 --> 00:09:06,426
and slaughtered
every last one of them, so...

212
00:09:06,428 --> 00:09:09,729
it was a happy ending.

213
00:09:09,731 --> 00:09:13,032
Well, for my nine-fingered Nana.

214
00:09:13,034 --> 00:09:15,868
Okay, back to the ring.
Does Amy even know about this?

215
00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:19,072
No. She broke up with me before
I could broach the subject.

216
00:09:19,074 --> 00:09:21,607
Oh, man, I'm sorry--
that must have been devastating for you.

217
00:09:21,609 --> 00:09:23,109
No, not at all.
No, I'm fine.

218
00:09:23,111 --> 00:09:25,378
You know, Amy had reservations
about our relationship,

219
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:27,046
so all worked out
for the best.

220
00:09:27,048 --> 00:09:30,216
PENNY: I know. It just...
SHELDON: I said I'm fine!

221
00:09:34,856 --> 00:09:37,757
We've gotten a little off-topic.

222
00:09:37,759 --> 00:09:40,093
Allow me to make things
entertaining again

223
00:09:40,095 --> 00:09:42,962
in this little Spockumentary.

224
00:09:46,893 --> 00:09:48,935
That was Leonard's joke.

225
00:09:59,114 --> 00:10:02,182
As a child,
when faced with a dilemma,

226
00:10:02,184 --> 00:10:05,618
my mother encouraged me to ask,
“What would Jesus do?”

227
00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:08,989
The answer to that was always,
“Love thy neighbor.”

228
00:10:08,991 --> 00:10:13,493
But<i> my</i> neighbor had
a dead tooth, so...

229
00:10:13,495 --> 00:10:15,662
that wasn't going to happen.

230
00:10:15,664 --> 00:10:17,497
But...

231
00:10:17,499 --> 00:10:21,634
that's why I changed it
to, “What would Spock do?”

232
00:10:21,636 --> 00:10:23,236
Did you find that helpful?

233
00:10:23,238 --> 00:10:26,039
Yes. Oh, for example,
three years ago

234
00:10:26,041 --> 00:10:28,808
when I discovered Penny
was eating all my Pop-Tarts,

235
00:10:28,810 --> 00:10:31,578
instead of getting angry
or vindictive,

236
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:34,214
you know, I got a floor safe.

237
00:10:34,216 --> 00:10:37,517
I knew I could smell 'em.

238
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:39,519
What about
from when you were a kid?

239
00:10:39,521 --> 00:10:42,122
Oh, certainly.
Uh, when I was eight years old,

240
00:10:42,124 --> 00:10:44,391
Billy Sparks cornered me
in the playground.

241
00:10:44,393 --> 00:10:46,826
I asked myself,
“What would Spock do?”

242
00:10:46,828 --> 00:10:49,362
Then I grabbed Billy
on his shoulder

243
00:10:49,364 --> 00:10:52,732
and performed
my first Vulcan nerve pinch.

244
00:10:54,136 --> 00:10:55,368
Did it work?

245
00:10:55,370 --> 00:10:57,670
Oh, no-- he broke my collarbone.

246
00:10:58,573 --> 00:11:02,108
I can still hear it click.

247
00:11:02,110 --> 00:11:03,558
That must have been
very upsetting for you.

248
00:11:03,582 --> 00:11:05,079
Oh, not at all.

249
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:07,947
As I said, the entire point
of emulating Spock

250
00:11:07,949 --> 00:11:10,350
was to rise above human emotion,

251
00:11:10,352 --> 00:11:12,552
which I've spent
a lifetime mastering.

252
00:11:12,554 --> 00:11:14,087
Oh... (sputters)

253
00:11:14,923 --> 00:11:16,990
Excuse me?

254
00:11:16,992 --> 00:11:19,125
I'm sorry.
I'm not here.

255
00:11:19,127 --> 00:11:21,594
No. You went (sputters).
What does (sputters) mean?

256
00:11:21,596 --> 00:11:22,962
Um...

257
00:11:22,964 --> 00:11:25,098
You did go (sputters).

258
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:27,267
All right, fine.
Well, Sheldon, I'm no expert,

259
00:11:27,269 --> 00:11:29,869
but aren't you completely
missing the point of Spock?

260
00:11:29,871 --> 00:11:31,171
I mean, he liked to act

261
00:11:31,173 --> 00:11:33,473
like he had no emotions,
but he was still half human.

262
00:11:33,475 --> 00:11:34,941
Just like you.

263
00:11:36,178 --> 00:11:37,577
I'm just saying,
you pretend you don't,

264
00:11:37,579 --> 00:11:39,312
but you have feelings
just like everybody else.

265
00:11:39,314 --> 00:11:41,781
Not true. No, look at me.

266
00:11:41,783 --> 00:11:44,050
I had an engagement
ring to give a girl,

267
00:11:44,052 --> 00:11:45,618
and instead,
she rejected me.

268
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:47,487
And am I emotional
about that? No.

269
00:11:47,489 --> 00:11:49,656
No, I am sitting here
on a couch,

270
00:11:49,658 --> 00:11:51,458
talking about my
favorite TV character

271
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:52,792
like nothing happened.

272
00:11:52,794 --> 00:11:55,361
'Cause I am just like him:
all logical, all the time.

273
00:11:55,363 --> 00:11:56,429
Sweetie, you're yelling.

274
00:11:56,431 --> 00:11:58,031
Because when I speak
at a regular volume,

275
00:11:58,033 --> 00:11:59,232
no one seems to believe me

276
00:11:59,234 --> 00:12:01,167
that I've put
this Amy nonsense behind me!

277
00:12:04,106 --> 00:12:05,305
(door slams)

278
00:12:06,608 --> 00:12:10,677
This documentary
is gonna be awesome.

279
00:12:13,215 --> 00:12:15,915
You gonna be okay down here?
Yeah. Yeah,

280
00:12:15,917 --> 00:12:17,383
I feel like
an archaeologist.

281
00:12:17,385 --> 00:12:20,854
<i>Indiana Jones and</i>
<i>the Single-Family Dwelling.</i>

282
00:12:21,723 --> 00:12:23,490
Hey. Look!

283
00:12:23,492 --> 00:12:25,391
Found a seashell.

284
00:12:25,393 --> 00:12:28,595
Yeah, that's a rat skull.
(shrieks)

285
00:12:28,597 --> 00:12:30,497
Relax.

286
00:12:30,499 --> 00:12:34,067
There's enough droppings down
here without you making more.

287
00:12:34,069 --> 00:12:37,570
Sorry. Do you have a...
sense of where we are?

288
00:12:37,572 --> 00:12:39,506
Yeah. I think that's the den.

289
00:12:39,508 --> 00:12:42,375
Oh. Okay, so we must be
under the dining room.

290
00:12:42,377 --> 00:12:43,776
Uh-huh. Yep.

291
00:12:43,778 --> 00:12:46,546
You know, I know you
don't want to hear this,

292
00:12:46,548 --> 00:12:49,282
but it wouldn't take that
much work to turn that den

293
00:12:49,284 --> 00:12:51,084
into a nursery.

294
00:12:51,086 --> 00:12:53,286
Why wouldn't I want to hear it?

295
00:12:53,288 --> 00:12:55,588
'Cause Bernie said
you didn't want kids.

296
00:12:55,590 --> 00:12:57,357
That's not true at all.

297
00:12:57,359 --> 00:12:58,791
I-I<i> wish</i>

298
00:12:58,793 --> 00:13:00,693
she'd get pregnant, believe me.

299
00:13:00,695 --> 00:13:04,497
I'm climbing on top of her
<i>every</i> chance I get.

300
00:13:04,499 --> 00:13:05,532
(sighs)

301
00:13:05,534 --> 00:13:08,935
In a... loving
and respectful manner.

302
00:13:08,937 --> 00:13:09,969
Oh.

303
00:13:09,971 --> 00:13:11,237
(clears throat softly)

304
00:13:11,239 --> 00:13:12,539
The point is,

305
00:13:12,541 --> 00:13:15,542
I really do want kids.

306
00:13:15,544 --> 00:13:17,076
Huh.

307
00:13:17,078 --> 00:13:19,712
I don't know why
she's lying to you.

308
00:13:19,714 --> 00:13:21,681
WOLOWITZ: She's the one
who doesn't want kids.

309
00:13:21,683 --> 00:13:23,383
In fact, every time I
bring up the subject...

310
00:13:23,385 --> 00:13:25,218
Earthquake!

311
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:27,287
(Bernadette's feet
stomping rapidly)

312
00:13:27,289 --> 00:13:29,589
Oh, my God,
we're gonna die!

313
00:13:29,591 --> 00:13:31,491
Earthquake!

314
00:13:32,127 --> 00:13:35,295
Aftershock...!

315
00:13:36,464 --> 00:13:39,199
I can't believe Sheldon was
gonna ask Amy to marry him.

316
00:13:39,201 --> 00:13:40,700
I know.
I also can't believe

317
00:13:40,702 --> 00:13:42,635
he watched what we did
on that couch

318
00:13:42,637 --> 00:13:44,871
and still sits on it.
Yeah.

319
00:13:46,474 --> 00:13:48,241
Hello.

320
00:13:48,243 --> 00:13:49,576
Hey, buddy.
How you doing?

321
00:13:49,578 --> 00:13:50,610
Better.

322
00:13:50,612 --> 00:13:52,612
Did Wil and Adam leave?
Yeah.

323
00:13:52,614 --> 00:13:54,981
Do you think they're
going to put my outburst

324
00:13:54,983 --> 00:13:56,316
in the documentary?

325
00:13:56,318 --> 00:13:58,418
Definitely.
Oh, yeah.

326
00:13:58,420 --> 00:14:01,921
Well, there's no point
in dwelling on it.

327
00:14:01,923 --> 00:14:03,489
As the Vulcans say,

328
00:14:03,491 --> 00:14:07,460
<i>“Kup-fun-tor</i>
<i>ha'kiv na'ish Du stau.”</i>

329
00:14:08,230 --> 00:14:10,630
Do you know what that means?
No.

330
00:14:10,632 --> 00:14:11,798
Are you telling the truth?

331
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:13,900
<i>Nirsh.</i>

332
00:14:15,203 --> 00:14:17,604
Well, this is ridiculous.
Being upset about Amy

333
00:14:17,606 --> 00:14:19,339
all the time
isn't accomplishing anything.

334
00:14:19,341 --> 00:14:21,074
If I want to resolve
this situation,

335
00:14:21,076 --> 00:14:22,709
then I need to take action.

336
00:14:22,711 --> 00:14:24,911
What are you gonna do?
I'm going to find her

337
00:14:24,913 --> 00:14:26,045
and ask her to marry me.

338
00:14:26,047 --> 00:14:28,481
And if she says yes,
we can put this behind us

339
00:14:28,483 --> 00:14:30,216
and resume our relationship.

340
00:14:30,218 --> 00:14:31,918
And if she says no...

341
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:35,355
well, then
she can just<i> ponfo miran.</i>

342
00:14:37,892 --> 00:14:40,059
He didn't meant that.

343
00:14:43,665 --> 00:14:48,001
So I should probably explain
why I kind of fibbed.

344
00:14:51,573 --> 00:14:53,806
That would be nice.

345
00:14:53,808 --> 00:14:56,142
I told my dad that
you were the one

346
00:14:56,144 --> 00:14:59,245
who didn't want kids because I
didn't want to disappoint him.

347
00:14:59,247 --> 00:15:01,881
But you were okay
throwing me under the bus?

348
00:15:01,883 --> 00:15:05,184
Turns out yeah,
I didn't think twice about it.

349
00:15:05,186 --> 00:15:08,655
Bernie, you don't need
to worry about me.

350
00:15:08,657 --> 00:15:11,224
But I don't want
to see you miss out.

351
00:15:11,226 --> 00:15:12,792
Raising children

352
00:15:12,794 --> 00:15:15,795
was the most rewarding
experience of my life.

353
00:15:15,797 --> 00:15:17,463
Oh,<i> please.</i>
Mom did everything.

354
00:15:17,465 --> 00:15:19,699
All you did was
come home from work,

355
00:15:19,701 --> 00:15:21,434
sit on the couch and drink beer.

356
00:15:21,436 --> 00:15:23,369
How is that raising kids?

357
00:15:23,371 --> 00:15:25,071
This is really

358
00:15:25,073 --> 00:15:27,106
a conversation
for husband and wife.

359
00:15:27,108 --> 00:15:30,209
(awkward chuckle) I'm gonna go clean up,
hit the road.

360
00:15:30,211 --> 00:15:33,279
If your mother asks,
I was here till 10:00.

361
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:38,718
It's interesting your father
didn't help around the house

362
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:40,720
and Howard doesn't help, either,

363
00:15:40,722 --> 00:15:42,188
so... in a way,

364
00:15:42,190 --> 00:15:44,557
Howard's not only
like your father,

365
00:15:44,559 --> 00:15:49,295
but he's also like the child
that you're afraid to have.

366
00:15:50,165 --> 00:15:52,298
Why are you still here?

367
00:15:54,369 --> 00:15:56,135
Fine, I'll leave.

368
00:15:56,137 --> 00:15:59,272
But it sounds like
<i>somebody</i> needs a fresh diaper.

369
00:16:04,346 --> 00:16:05,712
All right...

370
00:16:05,714 --> 00:16:08,781
I admit...
that I don't help out a lot.

371
00:16:08,783 --> 00:16:11,517
(chuckles softly)
And I need to work on that.

372
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:12,652
But...

373
00:16:12,654 --> 00:16:14,187
(sighs) if we had a kid,

374
00:16:14,189 --> 00:16:15,455
it would be different.

375
00:16:15,457 --> 00:16:17,090
Why?
Because...

376
00:16:17,092 --> 00:16:19,425
when my dad left,

377
00:16:19,427 --> 00:16:21,794
I promised myself that...

378
00:16:21,796 --> 00:16:26,232
if I ever had a chance
to be a father...

379
00:16:26,234 --> 00:16:28,634
I'd always be there.

380
00:16:30,171 --> 00:16:32,338
Okay, I'll think about it.

381
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:34,407
And this an actual
“I'll think about it,”

382
00:16:34,409 --> 00:16:36,442
not like the
“can we get a motorcycle

383
00:16:36,444 --> 00:16:38,978
with a sidecar
I'll think about it”?

384
00:16:40,048 --> 00:16:42,615
It's an actual
“I'll think about it.”

385
00:16:42,617 --> 00:16:46,519
I really believe
I'd be a great dad.

386
00:16:46,521 --> 00:16:48,988
I know you would.

387
00:16:48,990 --> 00:16:50,790
Speaking of...

388
00:16:50,792 --> 00:16:53,259
making babies,
what do you say I wash up

389
00:16:53,261 --> 00:16:55,895
and poke around<i> your</i> crawlspace?

390
00:17:06,741 --> 00:17:08,141
(no voice)

391
00:17:31,844 --> 00:17:33,744
Dr. Dana feels
he isn't that dangerous.

392
00:17:33,746 --> 00:17:36,246
What makes you right and
a trained psychiatrist wrong?

393
00:17:36,248 --> 00:17:38,515
Because she feels. I don't.

394
00:17:38,517 --> 00:17:40,050
All I know is logic.

395
00:17:40,052 --> 00:17:41,752
(scoffs):
Yeah, right.

396
00:17:41,754 --> 00:17:42,920
(turns off TV)

397
00:17:42,922 --> 00:17:44,722
You can just shut
your feelings off.

398
00:17:44,724 --> 00:17:47,091
There goes television,
lying to us again.

399
00:17:47,093 --> 00:17:48,292
We let you

400
00:17:48,294 --> 00:17:49,393
raise our children,

401
00:17:49,395 --> 00:17:51,428
and this is the thanks we get.

402
00:17:51,430 --> 00:17:53,897
Leonard, how could I
have been so foolish

403
00:17:53,899 --> 00:17:56,033
to try and follow
in the footsteps

404
00:17:56,035 --> 00:17:58,902
of a made-up alien race
with no emotions?

405
00:17:58,904 --> 00:18:00,471
(sighs):
Well...

406
00:18:00,473 --> 00:18:02,473
now instead of idolizing
fictional characters,

407
00:18:02,475 --> 00:18:06,443
you can focus on the real people
who are already in your life.

408
00:18:08,180 --> 00:18:10,280
Those are very wise words.

409
00:18:10,282 --> 00:18:11,482
Thank you.

410
00:18:11,484 --> 00:18:12,883
They'd just be
so much more comforting

411
00:18:12,885 --> 00:18:14,585
if they came
out of a television.
