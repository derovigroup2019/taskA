1
00:00:02,997 --> 00:00:04,598
Would you pass
the mustard?

2
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:05,699
Sure.

3
00:00:05,701 --> 00:00:07,534
Hey, want to hear
a fun fact about mustard?

4
00:00:07,536 --> 00:00:10,437
Is it that the glucosinolates
which give mustard its flavor

5
00:00:10,439 --> 00:00:11,805
were evolved
by the cabbage family

6
00:00:11,807 --> 00:00:14,441
as a chemical defense
against caterpillars?

7
00:00:14,443 --> 00:00:16,076
Yeah.

8
00:00:17,445 --> 00:00:19,246
Well, that was fun.

9
00:00:19,248 --> 00:00:21,381
Good for you, Leonard.

10
00:00:21,383 --> 00:00:22,916
Hey, there.

11
00:00:22,918 --> 00:00:23,917
Hey, you're early.

12
00:00:23,919 --> 00:00:25,652
The movie doesn't start
for an hour.

13
00:00:25,654 --> 00:00:27,287
Actually, we're not
going to the movies.

14
00:00:27,289 --> 00:00:29,956
We are here to kidnap you.

15
00:00:29,958 --> 00:00:31,291
What are you talking about?

16
00:00:31,293 --> 00:00:33,093
Well, you eloped and
we didn't get a chance

17
00:00:33,095 --> 00:00:34,527
to throw you
a bachelor party,

18
00:00:34,529 --> 00:00:36,062
so there's
a van downstairs

19
00:00:36,064 --> 00:00:37,697
and we're here
to take you

20
00:00:37,699 --> 00:00:39,699
to a surprise location
for the weekend.

21
00:00:39,701 --> 00:00:41,868
Well, I'd hardly
call this kidnapping.

22
00:00:41,870 --> 00:00:43,036
Where's the blindfold?

23
00:00:43,038 --> 00:00:44,271
Where's the duct tape?

24
00:00:44,273 --> 00:00:45,839
Where's the part

25
00:00:45,841 --> 00:00:47,574
where you call me
and demand ransom

26
00:00:47,576 --> 00:00:49,075
and I try to keep you
on the phone,

27
00:00:49,077 --> 00:00:51,344
but you hang up
seconds before I can trace it

28
00:00:51,346 --> 00:00:54,714
and then I say, "I'm getting
too old for this crud"?

29
00:00:56,884 --> 00:00:58,952
When do we leave?

30
00:00:58,954 --> 00:00:59,886
Right now.

31
00:00:59,888 --> 00:01:01,254
Yeah, Penny packed
you a bag.

32
00:01:01,256 --> 00:01:02,822
Wow, okay.

33
00:01:02,824 --> 00:01:04,724
You're seriously going to get
in a van and let these two

34
00:01:04,726 --> 00:01:05,992
take you
to an unknown destination

35
00:01:05,994 --> 00:01:07,460
for an entire weekend?

36
00:01:07,462 --> 00:01:09,362
Oh, not just him;
you're coming, too.

37
00:01:09,364 --> 00:01:11,998
Oh, and how do you think you're
going to get me to do that?

38
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,033
Unhand me!

39
00:01:13,035 --> 00:01:14,067
This is ridiculous!

40
00:01:14,069 --> 00:01:15,602
I told you to put tape
on his mouth!

41
00:01:15,604 --> 00:01:17,804
And I told you he bit me!

42
00:01:18,940 --> 00:01:22,575
?Our whole universe
was in a hot, dense state ?

43
00:01:22,577 --> 00:01:25,912
? Then nearly 14 billion years
ago expansion started... Wait! ?

44
00:01:25,914 --> 00:01:27,547
? The Earth began to cool ?

45
00:01:27,549 --> 00:01:30,083
? The autotrophs began to drool,
Neanderthals developed tools ?

46
00:01:30,085 --> 00:01:32,752
? We built the Wall ?
? <i>We built the pyramids</i> ?

47
00:01:32,754 --> 00:01:35,422
? Math, Science, History,
unraveling the mystery ?

48
00:01:35,424 --> 00:01:37,357
? That all started
with a big bang ?

49
00:01:37,359 --> 00:01:39,292
? <i>Bang!</i> ?

50
00:01:39,293 --> 00:01:43,293

52
00:01:48,304 --> 00:01:50,738
SHELDON:
<i>It's bad enough I'm being taken</i>

53
00:01:50,739 --> 00:01:51,883
against my will.

54
00:01:51,885 --> 00:01:53,285
I don't see why it has to be in

55
00:01:53,287 --> 00:01:55,187
some hippie's
mobile sex dungeon.

56
00:01:56,656 --> 00:01:58,624
Well, Sheldon,
there's something about this van

57
00:01:58,626 --> 00:02:00,726
that you're going to find
very interesting.

58
00:02:00,728 --> 00:02:03,528
It runs on syphilis?

59
00:02:05,064 --> 00:02:08,166
This van was owned
and driven by your personal

60
00:02:08,168 --> 00:02:09,501
physics hero...

61
00:02:09,503 --> 00:02:11,069
Richard Feynman.

62
00:02:11,071 --> 00:02:12,971
No.
Yeah!

63
00:02:12,973 --> 00:02:14,740
A buddy of mine
let me borrow it.

64
00:02:14,742 --> 00:02:16,508
This was Feynman's van?

65
00:02:16,510 --> 00:02:17,676
That's so cool.

66
00:02:17,678 --> 00:02:19,311
Yeah, nothing's been changed
since he drove it.

67
00:02:19,313 --> 00:02:22,014
I bet he picked up a lot of cute
grad students in this bad boy.

68
00:02:22,016 --> 00:02:24,049
Yeah, and talked about physics
with them!

69
00:02:24,051 --> 00:02:26,451
(gasps)

70
00:02:26,453 --> 00:02:28,453
So, are you gonna give us
a clue where we're headed?

71
00:02:28,455 --> 00:02:31,390
Uh, okay, let's see...

72
00:02:31,392 --> 00:02:33,058
They've got spicy food

73
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:36,061
and there's a chance
you'll get diarrhea.

74
00:02:36,063 --> 00:02:39,398
India.

75
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:41,533
We can drive there.

76
00:02:41,535 --> 00:02:43,368
Your house?

77
00:02:44,937 --> 00:02:47,539
We are going
to Meh-he-co!

78
00:02:47,541 --> 00:02:48,707
Fun, I've never been there!

79
00:02:48,709 --> 00:02:50,542
Leonard, don't be fooled!

80
00:02:50,544 --> 00:02:51,843
I'm from Texas--

81
00:02:51,845 --> 00:02:55,313
Meh-he-co is Spanish for Mexico.

82
00:02:55,315 --> 00:02:57,215
What's wrong with Mexico?

83
00:02:57,217 --> 00:02:59,885
Uh, mariachi bands, wild dogs,

84
00:02:59,887 --> 00:03:03,221
beans that jump around
'cause there's a worm inside.

85
00:03:03,223 --> 00:03:04,856
Okay, calm down.

86
00:03:04,858 --> 00:03:06,124
There's a theme
to this weekend.

87
00:03:06,126 --> 00:03:09,695
We are going to Mexico
in Feynman's van

88
00:03:09,697 --> 00:03:12,164
to stay at the vacation house
Feynman bought

89
00:03:12,166 --> 00:03:14,032
with the money
from his Nobel Prize.

90
00:03:14,034 --> 00:03:15,667
<i>Viva la Imodium!</i>

91
00:03:15,669 --> 00:03:17,202
<i>Ay-ay-ay!</i>

92
00:03:20,273 --> 00:03:22,708
Come on, Leonard's
doing bachelor stuff.

93
00:03:22,710 --> 00:03:24,443
You sure we can't take
you to a strip club?

94
00:03:24,445 --> 00:03:27,145
Nah, if I want to see
a naked dancing man,

95
00:03:27,147 --> 00:03:29,081
I just flush the toilet
while Leonard's in the shower.

96
00:03:29,083 --> 00:03:30,415
(giggles)

97
00:03:32,218 --> 00:03:34,653
Hi.
Hey.

98
00:03:34,655 --> 00:03:36,755
I know we're not making a fuss,

99
00:03:36,757 --> 00:03:39,691
but in the spirit
of bachelorette parties,

100
00:03:39,693 --> 00:03:43,061
I made cookies in the
shape of male genitals.

101
00:03:44,130 --> 00:03:46,031
You really
didn't have to...

102
00:03:46,033 --> 00:03:47,933
Whoa!

103
00:03:48,901 --> 00:03:51,269
That is anatomic.

104
00:03:51,271 --> 00:03:52,437
Thank you.

105
00:03:52,439 --> 00:03:54,406
The veins are gummy worms.

106
00:03:57,643 --> 00:03:59,277
Oh, look,

107
00:03:59,279 --> 00:04:01,980
Jewish and gentile.

108
00:04:02,815 --> 00:04:04,549
I had extra dough.

109
00:04:05,384 --> 00:04:07,519
(phone chimes)

110
00:04:07,521 --> 00:04:08,687
Oh, that's Leonard.

111
00:04:08,689 --> 00:04:10,088
He said they're about
to cross the border.

112
00:04:10,090 --> 00:04:12,657
I hope the boys don't get
too crazy in Mexico.

113
00:04:12,659 --> 00:04:14,559
Oh, yeah, right.
Lock up your daughters

114
00:04:14,561 --> 00:04:15,894
or Sheldon might
lecture them

115
00:04:15,896 --> 00:04:18,096
about the North American
Free Trade Agreement.

116
00:04:19,398 --> 00:04:22,667
Boy, that was
a long night for me.

117
00:04:24,670 --> 00:04:26,404
Uh-oh.

118
00:04:26,406 --> 00:04:28,807
According to this
Mexican Customs Web site,

119
00:04:28,809 --> 00:04:31,910
visitors may not bring
more than five laser discs,

120
00:04:31,912 --> 00:04:33,812
20 compact discs

121
00:04:33,814 --> 00:04:36,715
or 12 VHS tapes.

122
00:04:36,717 --> 00:04:39,518
We don't have
any of those.

123
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:41,086
How can you be sure?

124
00:04:41,088 --> 00:04:44,322
VHS was king
when Feynman drove this van.

125
00:04:44,324 --> 00:04:46,291
For all we know,
there are hidden compartments

126
00:04:46,293 --> 00:04:49,127
lousy with Jane Fonda
workout videos.

127
00:04:49,129 --> 00:04:51,329
If there was
a hidden compartment,

128
00:04:51,331 --> 00:04:54,166
don't you think you'd be
stuffed in it by now?

129
00:04:55,301 --> 00:04:58,804
Are we all up to date on our
yellow fever inoculations?

130
00:04:58,806 --> 00:05:02,307
You don't need a yellow fever
shot to go to Mexico.

131
00:05:02,309 --> 00:05:03,775
You can never be too careful.

132
00:05:03,777 --> 00:05:07,012
I got one last year
before I went to Epcot.

133
00:05:09,916 --> 00:05:11,416
So, Penny,
how's married life?

134
00:05:11,418 --> 00:05:12,517
Oh, it's good.

135
00:05:12,519 --> 00:05:14,152
I just wish Leonard
would work up the courage

136
00:05:14,154 --> 00:05:16,721
to tell Sheldon
he's moving in here.

137
00:05:16,723 --> 00:05:18,857
You guys still aren't
living together?

138
00:05:18,859 --> 00:05:20,826
We are. I mean, he sleeps here.

139
00:05:20,828 --> 00:05:22,260
But it's only a matter of time

140
00:05:22,262 --> 00:05:23,595
before Sheldon has a bad dream

141
00:05:23,597 --> 00:05:24,830
and tries to climb into bed

142
00:05:24,832 --> 00:05:27,499
with the Leonard-shaped
pile of pillows.

143
00:05:28,367 --> 00:05:30,135
Speaking of Sheldon,

144
00:05:30,137 --> 00:05:31,369
how's single life treating you?

145
00:05:31,371 --> 00:05:33,171
Fine, I guess.

146
00:05:33,173 --> 00:05:34,739
I've been focusing on me.

147
00:05:34,741 --> 00:05:36,708
I was thinking about
changing my wardrobe.

148
00:05:36,710 --> 00:05:38,810
Yes!
Good for you!

149
00:05:39,979 --> 00:05:42,480
But then I decided I don't want
to go changing who I am

150
00:05:42,482 --> 00:05:43,782
just because of some man.

151
00:05:43,784 --> 00:05:46,651
Yes.
Good for you.

152
00:05:47,954 --> 00:05:49,087
You know, it is normal

153
00:05:49,089 --> 00:05:50,789
to want to change your
look after a breakup.

154
00:05:50,791 --> 00:05:53,625
Actually, I was thinking
of making one small change.

155
00:05:53,627 --> 00:05:54,960
Your sweater?
Your glasses?

156
00:05:54,962 --> 00:05:56,528
Your hair?
Your shoes!

157
00:05:56,530 --> 00:05:58,630
Piercing my ears.

158
00:05:58,632 --> 00:06:00,298
Oh.
Oh.

159
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:01,766
You really never
had that done?

160
00:06:01,768 --> 00:06:03,235
My mom said pierced ears

161
00:06:03,237 --> 00:06:06,204
were for whores,
pirates and genies.

162
00:06:07,406 --> 00:06:09,875
Okay, well, you're
a grown woman now.

163
00:06:09,877 --> 00:06:12,544
I know, but Sheldon
had this clause

164
00:06:12,546 --> 00:06:13,879
in the Relationship Agreement

165
00:06:13,881 --> 00:06:15,247
forbidding cosmetic surgery

166
00:06:15,249 --> 00:06:17,616
unless it's to look
like a Klingon.

167
00:06:19,018 --> 00:06:20,719
We'll take you to the
mall to get it done.

168
00:06:20,721 --> 00:06:22,287
Why? I can do it
right here.

169
00:06:22,289 --> 00:06:23,321
Really?

170
00:06:23,323 --> 00:06:24,856
You have a piercing gun?
No.

171
00:06:24,858 --> 00:06:26,291
All you need is a needle
and an ice cube.

172
00:06:26,293 --> 00:06:27,626
I've done it, like,
a dozen times.

173
00:06:27,628 --> 00:06:29,194
Oh, I don't know.

174
00:06:29,196 --> 00:06:30,929
Oh, come on.
I'll be gentle.

175
00:06:30,931 --> 00:06:33,098
Let me take your ear virginity.

176
00:06:34,634 --> 00:06:37,469
This party's weird.

177
00:06:39,872 --> 00:06:41,439
Hey, watch your speed.

178
00:06:41,441 --> 00:06:42,974
I hear the Mexican police
target tourists.

179
00:06:42,976 --> 00:06:44,943
Oh, not a problem.

180
00:06:44,945 --> 00:06:46,111
If anything goes down,

181
00:06:46,113 --> 00:06:47,879
we just put Koothrappali
in the driver's seat

182
00:06:47,881 --> 00:06:50,882
and slap a sombrero
on his head.

183
00:06:50,884 --> 00:06:54,686
Dude, how many races can you
offend in a single breath?

184
00:06:54,688 --> 00:06:55,820
I don't know.

185
00:06:55,822 --> 00:06:58,056
Have you watched
the Olympics with me?

186
00:06:59,158 --> 00:07:01,359
Sheldon, can you believe
that we're driving in a van

187
00:07:01,361 --> 00:07:03,361
that was owned by one of
the greatest scientific minds

188
00:07:03,363 --> 00:07:05,096
of the 20th century?

189
00:07:05,098 --> 00:07:06,498
It's like the Batmobile.

190
00:07:07,233 --> 00:07:08,867
If Batman was real

191
00:07:08,869 --> 00:07:10,335
and a physicist

192
00:07:10,337 --> 00:07:13,071
and his car wasn't cool.

193
00:07:13,073 --> 00:07:14,940
It is extraordinary.

194
00:07:14,942 --> 00:07:17,943
Perhaps some of his mojo
will rub off on us.

195
00:07:17,945 --> 00:07:20,345
Maybe between this
and his beach house,

196
00:07:20,347 --> 00:07:22,447
we will be inspired
to greatness.

197
00:07:22,449 --> 00:07:25,583
I usually don't put too much
stock in charms and talismans.

198
00:07:25,585 --> 00:07:27,018
However, even I must admit

199
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:28,620
feeling Richard Feynman's

200
00:07:28,622 --> 00:07:32,223
butt dent cupping
my own bottom...

201
00:07:32,225 --> 00:07:35,060
that does get
the creative juices flowing.

202
00:07:36,429 --> 00:07:38,096
Hey, I have to return this van.

203
00:07:38,098 --> 00:07:40,532
Keep your creative juices
in your pants.

204
00:07:40,534 --> 00:07:42,233
(bang and hiss)

205
00:07:42,235 --> 00:07:43,301
What was that?

206
00:07:43,303 --> 00:07:44,936
I think it's a tire.

207
00:07:44,938 --> 00:07:47,439
What if it's banditos
shooting at us?

208
00:07:47,441 --> 00:07:48,807
What if we get kidnapped?

209
00:07:48,809 --> 00:07:51,476
What if we end up in a factory
making Bart Simpson pi?atas

210
00:07:51,478 --> 00:07:53,745
for the rest of our lives?!

211
00:07:53,747 --> 00:07:55,914
It's the tire.

212
00:07:56,782 --> 00:07:57,916
Leonard?

213
00:07:57,918 --> 00:07:58,950
What?

214
00:07:58,952 --> 00:08:01,519
I am getting too old
for this crud.

215
00:08:04,523 --> 00:08:07,092
Amy, I noticed
your status still says

216
00:08:07,094 --> 00:08:09,527
"in a relationship"
on Facebook.

217
00:08:09,529 --> 00:08:10,962
You're right.

218
00:08:10,964 --> 00:08:13,164
I should probably let
all of my Facebook friends know.

219
00:08:13,166 --> 00:08:16,935
Penny, I'm no longer
in a relationship.

220
00:08:18,471 --> 00:08:20,638
Did you change yours
to "married" yet?

221
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:22,073
Uh, no, not yet.

222
00:08:22,075 --> 00:08:24,109
There's still a few people
I haven't told personally.

223
00:08:24,111 --> 00:08:25,176
Who?

224
00:08:25,178 --> 00:08:26,678
Oh, just my parents

225
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:28,179
and my entire family.
(clears throat)

226
00:08:28,181 --> 00:08:29,948
What?

227
00:08:29,950 --> 00:08:31,016
Why?

228
00:08:31,018 --> 00:08:32,450
Well, I don't want
to hurt my dad.

229
00:08:32,452 --> 00:08:33,651
You know, he always wanted

230
00:08:33,653 --> 00:08:35,320
to dance with his daughter
at her wedding.

231
00:08:35,322 --> 00:08:36,855
What about
your sister's wedding?

232
00:08:36,857 --> 00:08:39,824
They started to,
then her water broke.

233
00:08:40,993 --> 00:08:42,894
You know, if he finds out
we eloped,

234
00:08:42,896 --> 00:08:44,062
it's gonna break his heart.

235
00:08:44,064 --> 00:08:45,897
How long do you think
you can keep it from him?

236
00:08:45,899 --> 00:08:48,733
Yeah, isn't it gonna get
worse the longer you wait?

237
00:08:48,735 --> 00:08:50,268
Well, not necessarily.

238
00:08:50,270 --> 00:08:52,103
You know,
Dad's not getting any younger,

239
00:08:52,105 --> 00:08:53,705
so if I wait long enough,

240
00:08:53,707 --> 00:08:55,473
I'll just tell him
he walked me down the aisle

241
00:08:55,475 --> 00:08:57,008
and it was magical.

242
00:09:02,148 --> 00:09:04,315
When did you learn
how to change a tire?

243
00:09:04,317 --> 00:09:06,684
Every self-respecting gentleman
should know how

244
00:09:06,686 --> 00:09:08,987
in case he comes across
a damsel in distress

245
00:09:08,989 --> 00:09:10,488
by the side of the road.

246
00:09:11,824 --> 00:09:12,991
If I see one scorpion,

247
00:09:12,993 --> 00:09:14,359
I am getting
on someone's shoulders

248
00:09:14,361 --> 00:09:16,394
and never coming down.

249
00:09:16,396 --> 00:09:18,630
And there's your damsel.

250
00:09:19,965 --> 00:09:22,333
Wow, this one's really stuck.

251
00:09:22,335 --> 00:09:23,968
Are you turning
it the right way?

252
00:09:23,970 --> 00:09:25,537
No.

253
00:09:25,539 --> 00:09:26,805
I took the other four off

254
00:09:26,807 --> 00:09:28,339
and when I got to this one,
I thought,

255
00:09:28,341 --> 00:09:30,208
"You know, I'm in a rut.
Let's shake things up."

256
00:09:30,210 --> 00:09:32,077
Here, let me try.

257
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:35,580
(grunting)

258
00:09:38,551 --> 00:09:41,319
You're right, it doesn't turn
the other way.

259
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:49,074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

260
00:09:52,259 --> 00:09:53,761
There you go.

261
00:09:53,762 --> 00:09:54,727
You're all done!

262
00:09:54,729 --> 00:09:56,162
That wasn't so bad.

263
00:09:56,164 --> 00:09:57,463
(inhales delightedly)

264
00:09:57,465 --> 00:09:59,065
Nice.

265
00:09:59,067 --> 00:10:01,067
Boy, if my mom could see me now,

266
00:10:01,069 --> 00:10:03,670
she'd lock me in the sin closet.

267
00:10:05,739 --> 00:10:07,173
That's a joke, right?

268
00:10:07,175 --> 00:10:08,875
Actually, the joke was on her.

269
00:10:08,877 --> 00:10:10,977
I could still see the TV
through the slats.

270
00:10:12,046 --> 00:10:13,546
I'm starting to see

271
00:10:13,548 --> 00:10:15,615
why you and your mom
aren't very close.

272
00:10:16,383 --> 00:10:17,517
Bet she'd still tell her

273
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:18,618
if she got married.

274
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:20,587
You're not gonna
let this go, are you?

275
00:10:20,589 --> 00:10:22,522
Well, it's kind of sad
that they don't know.

276
00:10:22,524 --> 00:10:24,157
I mean, they love Leonard.

277
00:10:24,159 --> 00:10:25,425
Fine, you want
me to call?

278
00:10:25,427 --> 00:10:26,559
I'll call.

279
00:10:26,561 --> 00:10:28,127
(exhales)

280
00:10:28,129 --> 00:10:29,696
Why am I so nervous?

281
00:10:29,698 --> 00:10:30,964
It's understandable.

282
00:10:30,966 --> 00:10:33,700
Amy was afraid to tell her mom
she broke up with Sheldon.

283
00:10:33,702 --> 00:10:34,868
Yeah?
How did it go?

284
00:10:34,870 --> 00:10:36,135
Did she make you crawl

285
00:10:36,137 --> 00:10:37,670
into the breaking-up drawer?

286
00:10:39,306 --> 00:10:40,907
Uh, well, actually,
to be honest...

287
00:10:40,909 --> 00:10:42,467
I-I haven't told her yet.

288
00:10:42,468 --> 00:10:44,235
You've been giving me
a hard time

289
00:10:44,236 --> 00:10:46,203
and you haven't even told
your mom about Sheldon?

290
00:10:46,573 --> 00:10:48,372
I'm feeling a little dizzy
from all the blood loss.

291
00:10:48,373 --> 00:10:50,006
I don't know
what you're talking about.

292
00:10:52,076 --> 00:10:53,810
Fine. I'm calling home,

293
00:10:53,812 --> 00:10:55,312
but when I'm done,
you're calling your mother.

294
00:10:55,314 --> 00:10:57,447
Easy for you to say.

295
00:10:57,449 --> 00:10:59,749
You never had to watch
<i>60 Minutes</i> like this.

296
00:11:02,353 --> 00:11:03,520
Hey, Daddy.

297
00:11:03,522 --> 00:11:04,788
Hey, slugger.

298
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:06,189
How's my girl?

299
00:11:06,191 --> 00:11:07,824
Uh, good. Is Mom around?

300
00:11:07,826 --> 00:11:09,926
Ah, she took your brother out
to celebrate.

301
00:11:09,928 --> 00:11:12,796
He just got his tenth
one-month sober chip.

302
00:11:13,998 --> 00:11:17,767
Yeah, she's gonna make him
a little necklace.

303
00:11:17,769 --> 00:11:19,236
Okay, I'll talk to her later.

304
00:11:19,238 --> 00:11:21,071
Uh, Dad, there's something
I need to tell you.

305
00:11:21,706 --> 00:11:24,207
Leonard and I got married.

306
00:11:24,209 --> 00:11:25,375
You did?

307
00:11:25,377 --> 00:11:26,710
When?

308
00:11:26,712 --> 00:11:28,378
Last week. I'm sorry,
I should've told you.

309
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:29,746
It was a spur
of the moment thing.

310
00:11:29,748 --> 00:11:30,981
I feel terrible.

311
00:11:30,983 --> 00:11:32,349
Please don't be
too disappointed.

312
00:11:32,351 --> 00:11:34,551
Are you happy?

313
00:11:34,553 --> 00:11:35,552
Very.

314
00:11:35,554 --> 00:11:36,853
Leonard is so great.

315
00:11:36,855 --> 00:11:38,688
Well, then I'm happy for you.

316
00:11:38,690 --> 00:11:40,890
Aw, thank you, Daddy.

317
00:11:40,892 --> 00:11:41,958
That means so much.

318
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:43,260
Well, I understand it's hard

319
00:11:43,262 --> 00:11:44,494
to tell someone something

320
00:11:44,496 --> 00:11:46,429
if you think
it's gonna upset 'em.

321
00:11:46,431 --> 00:11:47,664
It is.

322
00:11:47,666 --> 00:11:49,065
You're the best dad ever.

323
00:11:49,067 --> 00:11:52,569
Yeah. Uh, hold that thought.

324
00:11:52,571 --> 00:11:54,904
I've been sitting
on a little news myself.

325
00:11:54,906 --> 00:11:56,539
Well, what is it?

326
00:11:56,541 --> 00:11:59,709
You know that rototiller
I got for the tractor?

327
00:11:59,711 --> 00:12:00,777
No.

328
00:12:00,779 --> 00:12:01,811
Oh, you should see it.

329
00:12:01,813 --> 00:12:04,481
It is a beautiful
piece of machinery.

330
00:12:04,483 --> 00:12:07,217
Anyway, uh...

331
00:12:07,219 --> 00:12:10,186
I backed over
your pet pig with it.

332
00:12:10,188 --> 00:12:12,689
Moondance?

333
00:12:12,691 --> 00:12:15,925
Yeah, he's, uh,
not dancing anymore.

334
00:12:15,927 --> 00:12:17,894
You killed my pig?

335
00:12:18,929 --> 00:12:20,130
I did not kill him.

336
00:12:20,132 --> 00:12:22,465
The vet took care of that.

337
00:12:22,467 --> 00:12:24,200
When?

338
00:12:24,202 --> 00:12:27,270
Oh... ten, 12 months ago.

339
00:12:28,606 --> 00:12:29,973
You didn't tell me for a year?!

340
00:12:29,975 --> 00:12:32,442
Well, apple doesn't fall far
from the tree, does it?

341
00:12:33,477 --> 00:12:34,644
Love ya, slugger.

342
00:12:34,646 --> 00:12:36,313
Gotta go!

343
00:12:38,749 --> 00:12:40,950
Okay, Amy, your turn.

344
00:12:43,754 --> 00:12:45,455
(grunting)

345
00:12:45,457 --> 00:12:46,956
(breathing rhythmically)

346
00:12:50,494 --> 00:12:52,662
What are you doing?

347
00:12:52,664 --> 00:12:54,631
It's called Lamaze breathing.

348
00:12:54,633 --> 00:12:57,267
It helps you push.

349
00:12:58,102 --> 00:12:59,369
Great.

350
00:12:59,371 --> 00:13:00,770
He's pushing
with his uterus.

351
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:05,909
There's got to be a smarter way
of removing it.

352
00:13:05,911 --> 00:13:07,677
Yeah, this is nothing more
than a physics problem.

353
00:13:07,679 --> 00:13:08,945
Right.

354
00:13:08,947 --> 00:13:10,714
Archimedes once said,

355
00:13:10,716 --> 00:13:11,981
"Give me a 'leever' long enough

356
00:13:11,983 --> 00:13:13,483
"and a fulcrum
on which to place it,

357
00:13:13,485 --> 00:13:14,818
and I shall move the world."

358
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:16,519
Of course.

359
00:13:16,521 --> 00:13:18,221
All we need is to find stuff

360
00:13:18,223 --> 00:13:20,724
to make a "leever" big
enough to fix this.

361
00:13:20,726 --> 00:13:21,958
Exactly.

362
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:23,126
I'll bet there's
something around here

363
00:13:23,128 --> 00:13:24,728
that could
be a "lehver."

364
00:13:24,730 --> 00:13:27,163
Let's see, a "lehver,"
a "lehver"...

365
00:13:27,165 --> 00:13:28,565
Everybody hold on!

366
00:13:28,567 --> 00:13:30,300
Let's take this problem
one step at a time.

367
00:13:30,302 --> 00:13:31,968
First, we need to decide

368
00:13:31,970 --> 00:13:34,270
whether we're calling it
leever or lehver.

369
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:38,174
And the sooner
we decide it's leever,

370
00:13:38,176 --> 00:13:41,044
the sooner we can roll up
our sleeves-- not slehves--

371
00:13:41,046 --> 00:13:42,712
and get to work.

372
00:13:42,714 --> 00:13:44,614
We're gonna be here
"foreever."

373
00:13:48,285 --> 00:13:49,719
Thanks a lot, guys.

374
00:13:49,721 --> 00:13:50,787
What did we do?

375
00:13:50,789 --> 00:13:52,055
Before I made that call,

376
00:13:52,057 --> 00:13:53,356
my pig was alive and happy

377
00:13:53,358 --> 00:13:54,691
and rolling around in the mud.

378
00:13:54,693 --> 00:13:57,060
Now he's illegally buried
in our backyard

379
00:13:57,062 --> 00:13:59,362
next to my great-grandmother.

380
00:13:59,364 --> 00:14:01,598
Really?

381
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:04,501
They didn't eat him?

382
00:14:04,503 --> 00:14:06,369
No.

383
00:14:06,371 --> 00:14:09,038
He was a beloved member
of the family.

384
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:12,108
The breakfast meat family?

385
00:14:13,878 --> 00:14:15,311
It's not funny.

386
00:14:15,313 --> 00:14:16,780
You're up.
Call your mother.

387
00:14:16,782 --> 00:14:18,281
Oh, maybe later.

388
00:14:18,283 --> 00:14:21,017
Your pig dying
made me sad.

389
00:14:21,019 --> 00:14:23,019
And a little hungry.

390
00:14:23,021 --> 00:14:24,521
Phone, now.

391
00:14:24,523 --> 00:14:26,222
Okay. Okay.

392
00:14:26,224 --> 00:14:27,857
Fine.

393
00:14:30,628 --> 00:14:31,995
Hi, Mom.

394
00:14:31,997 --> 00:14:33,329
Try dialing.

395
00:14:35,032 --> 00:14:36,866
You saw that, huh?

396
00:14:40,771 --> 00:14:43,139
Hi, Mom. How are you doing?

397
00:14:44,375 --> 00:14:45,608
Oh, good.

398
00:14:45,610 --> 00:14:47,243
How's work?

399
00:14:47,245 --> 00:14:48,211
That's nice.

400
00:14:48,213 --> 00:14:49,612
I'm fine.

401
00:14:49,614 --> 00:14:51,748
Hey, listen,
I've been meaning to ask,

402
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:55,151
how come Aunt Doe and
Aunt Florence never got along?

403
00:14:55,153 --> 00:14:56,519
Okay, just...
give me that.

404
00:14:56,521 --> 00:14:58,021
Amy broke up with Sheldon,

405
00:14:58,023 --> 00:14:59,088
she got her ears pierced

406
00:14:59,090 --> 00:15:01,658
and she made us
eat penis cookies!

407
00:15:04,728 --> 00:15:05,962
Hang on.

408
00:15:05,964 --> 00:15:07,997
She wants to talk to you.

409
00:15:12,236 --> 00:15:14,137
I don't think
the lever's working.

410
00:15:14,139 --> 00:15:15,705
WOLOWITZ:
What makes you say that?

411
00:15:20,678 --> 00:15:23,413
There's gotta be
something else we could try.

412
00:15:23,415 --> 00:15:25,348
If this was <i>Star</i> <i>Trek,</i>

413
00:15:25,350 --> 00:15:27,517
we could use a phaser
to blast it off.

414
00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:29,385
No, it's too
broad of a beam.

415
00:15:29,387 --> 00:15:30,987
You'd need something
more precise,

416
00:15:30,989 --> 00:15:32,989
like Superman's heat vision.

417
00:15:32,991 --> 00:15:34,324
Ooh, the Green
Lantern's ring

418
00:15:34,326 --> 00:15:36,426
could make a big green
hand that unscrews it.

419
00:15:36,428 --> 00:15:37,961
If you need
a green hand,

420
00:15:37,963 --> 00:15:39,229
why not just
use the Hulk?

421
00:15:39,231 --> 00:15:40,797
Oh, please, the Hulk
would never get

422
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:42,999
across the border
with that temper.

423
00:15:43,001 --> 00:15:44,601
LEONARD:
Guys, excuse me,

424
00:15:44,603 --> 00:15:46,569
not that calling
one of the Avengers

425
00:15:46,571 --> 00:15:48,805
isn't a perfectly
reasonable choice,

426
00:15:48,807 --> 00:15:49,939
but we're
scientists.

427
00:15:49,941 --> 00:15:51,608
Don't you think we
can figure this out

428
00:15:51,610 --> 00:15:52,976
using actual science?

429
00:15:52,978 --> 00:15:55,011
Yes, we could
use science.

430
00:15:55,013 --> 00:15:56,279
But it's your
bachelor party.

431
00:15:56,281 --> 00:15:57,680
Lighten up.

432
00:16:00,184 --> 00:16:02,852
(slow, measured tapping)

433
00:16:12,029 --> 00:16:13,930
? We will ?

434
00:16:13,932 --> 00:16:17,066
? We will
percussive shock you ?

435
00:16:17,835 --> 00:16:19,702
? We will ?

436
00:16:19,704 --> 00:16:22,105
? We will
percussive shock you ?

437
00:16:23,774 --> 00:16:25,108
(falsetto):
? Buddy you're a boy ?

438
00:16:25,110 --> 00:16:26,576
? Make a big noise ?

439
00:16:26,578 --> 00:16:27,810
? Playin' in the street ?

440
00:16:27,812 --> 00:16:29,579
? Gonna be a big man someday ?

441
00:16:29,581 --> 00:16:32,382
? You got mud on your face,
you big disgrace ?

442
00:16:32,384 --> 00:16:35,318
? Kickin' your can
all over the place. ?

443
00:16:40,224 --> 00:16:41,724
I have an eidetic memory.

444
00:16:41,726 --> 00:16:43,192
Sometimes it's a curse.

445
00:16:44,395 --> 00:16:46,696
(match strikes)

446
00:16:48,198 --> 00:16:50,233
I had no idea

447
00:16:50,235 --> 00:16:51,935
tortilla chips were
such a good fuel source.

448
00:16:51,937 --> 00:16:55,838
They're basically pure
hydrocarbons soaked in fat.

449
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:57,807
Let's hope the lug nut expands.

450
00:16:57,809 --> 00:17:00,043
What if that burning
food attracts animals?

451
00:17:00,045 --> 00:17:02,178
We have plenty of food
for the animals.

452
00:17:02,180 --> 00:17:03,546
We do?
WOLOWITZ: Yep.

453
00:17:03,548 --> 00:17:06,249
A six-foot wiener
in a Flash T-shirt.

454
00:17:06,251 --> 00:17:08,685
That's not very nice.

455
00:17:08,687 --> 00:17:10,553
It's a bachelor party.
Lighten up.

456
00:17:12,456 --> 00:17:14,791
(electric crackling)

457
00:17:15,593 --> 00:17:18,595
What is that awful smell?

458
00:17:18,597 --> 00:17:19,829
It's burning salsa.

459
00:17:19,831 --> 00:17:21,564
I'm hoping the acidity
and salinity

460
00:17:21,566 --> 00:17:23,633
combined with electricity
will corrode the lug nut off.

461
00:17:23,635 --> 00:17:26,169
What an innovative solution.

462
00:17:26,171 --> 00:17:29,606
Perhaps I don't give your
MIT education enough credit.

463
00:17:29,608 --> 00:17:32,075
Yeah, I saw it on <i>Mythbusters.</i>

464
00:17:33,944 --> 00:17:36,145
(metal scraping metal)

465
00:17:37,314 --> 00:17:40,049
All right, this rust,

466
00:17:40,051 --> 00:17:42,852
combined with the aluminum
recovered from the van,

467
00:17:42,854 --> 00:17:44,454
is now thermite.

468
00:17:44,456 --> 00:17:45,455
Great.

469
00:17:45,457 --> 00:17:47,590
Couple pinches
ought to do the trick.

470
00:17:47,592 --> 00:17:49,559
Is that enough
to melt the lug nut?

471
00:17:49,561 --> 00:17:50,526
Well, let's start small.

472
00:17:50,528 --> 00:17:51,561
We can always add more.

473
00:17:51,563 --> 00:17:54,497
You put up a good fight,
lug nut,

474
00:17:54,499 --> 00:17:58,201
but you've met your match.

475
00:18:15,586 --> 00:18:16,819
Hey, look!

476
00:18:16,821 --> 00:18:19,522
The lug nut's off.

477
00:18:36,705 --> 00:18:38,172
What...

478
00:18:38,174 --> 00:18:40,307
What are you
doing back?

479
00:18:42,444 --> 00:18:43,844
We got a flat

480
00:18:43,846 --> 00:18:45,145
and couldn't get
the tire off.

481
00:18:45,147 --> 00:18:46,980
Oh, I'm sorry.

482
00:18:46,982 --> 00:18:48,315
Thank you.

483
00:18:48,317 --> 00:18:49,783
If it makes you feel any better,

484
00:18:49,785 --> 00:18:51,085
I pierced Amy's ears

485
00:18:51,087 --> 00:18:53,854
and her mom made her sit
in my closet.

486
00:18:58,159 --> 00:18:59,693
We blew up Feynman's van.

487
00:18:59,695 --> 00:19:02,262
My dad killed my pig
with his tractor.

488
00:19:02,264 --> 00:19:04,698
I spent the night
in Mexico with Sheldon.

489
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:06,033
You win.
