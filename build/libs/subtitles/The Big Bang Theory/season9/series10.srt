00:00:03,038 --> 00:00:05,831
Sheldon Cooper's
descent into madness...

2
00:00:05,847 --> 00:00:09,315
day two.

3
00:00:09,317 --> 00:00:10,850
It's 2:25 a.m.,

4
00:00:10,852 --> 00:00:14,787
and I feel the urge to urinate.

5
00:00:14,789 --> 00:00:18,090
My normal urination time
is 7:10 a.m.,

6
00:00:18,092 --> 00:00:21,027
but here I am,
in the middle of the night,

7
00:00:21,029 --> 00:00:23,195
struggling to keep my mind sharp

8
00:00:23,197 --> 00:00:26,999
and my pajamas dry.

9
00:00:27,001 --> 00:00:28,301
It's only a matter of time

10
00:00:28,303 --> 00:00:32,872
before my tenuous grasp
on reality fades.

11
00:00:32,874 --> 00:00:36,842
I suppose I should pee while
I still know what a toilet is.

13
00:00:51,292 --> 00:00:54,160
Since when do you hum songs?

14
00:00:54,162 --> 00:00:55,294
What are you talking
about?

15
00:00:55,296 --> 00:00:56,595
You were just humming.
Are you sure?

16
00:00:56,597 --> 00:00:59,565
Sometimes when my brain
really gets moving,

17
00:00:59,567 --> 00:01:02,134
it makes noise.

18
00:01:02,136 --> 00:01:04,437
How does your brain feel about
calculating the surface tension

19
00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:05,705
of the domain walls?

20
00:01:05,707 --> 00:01:08,007
Let's see.

21
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:12,311
Hey! I<i> was</i> humming.

22
00:01:12,313 --> 00:01:15,514
One point
for Hufflepuff.

23
00:01:18,453 --> 00:01:20,386
What song is that?

24
00:01:20,388 --> 00:01:23,222
Well... Hum it again.

25
00:01:25,126 --> 00:01:26,926
Is that the<i> SpongeBob</i> song?

26
00:01:26,928 --> 00:01:31,097
? Who lives
in a pineapple ? Nope.

27
00:01:31,099 --> 00:01:32,498
Whatever. Can we just
get back to this?

28
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:33,866
I feel like I know
what song that is,

29
00:01:33,868 --> 00:01:36,402
but I can't put
my finger on it.

30
00:01:36,404 --> 00:01:39,572
? My country, 'tis of thee ?
No.

31
00:01:39,574 --> 00:01:42,241
It's just an earworm.
It'll come to you.

32
00:01:42,243 --> 00:01:45,044
Okay.

33
00:01:46,981 --> 00:01:48,948
? R-E-S-P-E-C-T ?

34
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:50,383
No.

35
00:01:50,385 --> 00:01:52,585
Is this what we're doing
the rest of the night?

36
00:01:52,587 --> 00:01:55,721
? I'm surprised
you have to ask... ?

37
00:01:55,723 --> 00:01:59,191
? Our whole universe
was in a hot, dense state ?

38
00:01:59,193 --> 00:02:02,695
? Then nearly 14 billion years
ago expansion started... Wait! ?

39
00:02:02,697 --> 00:02:04,330
? The Earth began to cool ?

40
00:02:04,332 --> 00:02:06,866
? The autotrophs began to drool,
Neanderthals developed tools ?

41
00:02:06,868 --> 00:02:09,535
? We built the Wall ?
?<i> We built the pyramids</i> ?

42
00:02:09,537 --> 00:02:12,238
? Math, Science, History,
unraveling the mystery ?

43
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:14,106
? That all started
with a big bang ?

44
00:02:14,108 --> 00:02:15,875
?<i> Bang!</i> ?

47
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:27,159
Hello, yes, I was hoping
you could help me.

48
00:02:27,161 --> 00:02:31,731
What song is this?
? La, la, la, la, la, la, la. ?

49
00:02:31,733 --> 00:02:33,132
You don't know?

50
00:02:33,134 --> 00:02:34,600
Well, how dare you
call yourselves

51
00:02:34,602 --> 00:02:37,903
a Rock and Roll Hall of Fame?

52
00:02:37,905 --> 00:02:40,706
My goodness. Do you sing along
to the greatest hits

53
00:02:40,708 --> 00:02:43,009
of Elvis Presley
with that mouth?

54
00:02:43,011 --> 00:02:45,478
Well, they were no help at all.
Which is crazy,

55
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:49,515
since rock and roll is all
about good customer service.

56
00:02:49,517 --> 00:02:51,550
Yeah. So you have a song
stuck in your head.

57
00:02:51,552 --> 00:02:52,818
It happens to everybody.

58
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:54,887
Well, I'm not everybody.
I have an eidetic memory.

59
00:02:54,889 --> 00:02:57,089
I should be able to remember
what song this is,

60
00:02:57,091 --> 00:02:58,024
but I can't.

61
00:02:58,026 --> 00:02:59,892
Something's wrong with me.

62
00:02:59,894 --> 00:03:02,962
I told you if we were patient,
he'd figure it out for himself.

63
00:03:02,964 --> 00:03:05,698
Oh... I was always afraid
this day would come.

64
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:09,302
This might be the first step
of my descent into madness,

65
00:03:09,304 --> 00:03:12,938
where I gradually test
the limits of public nudity.

66
00:03:13,775 --> 00:03:14,740
Public nudity?

67
00:03:14,742 --> 00:03:17,977
Eh, that just means
going barefoot.

68
00:03:25,787 --> 00:03:27,887
Hello?
Hi, Dave.

69
00:03:27,889 --> 00:03:29,188
Uh, it's Amy.

70
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:31,791
Oh. How are you?
I'm fine. How are you?

71
00:03:31,793 --> 00:03:34,827
Terrific. And pleasantly
surprised to hear from you,

72
00:03:34,829 --> 00:03:37,363
given how I acted
on our last date.

73
00:03:37,365 --> 00:03:38,397
Yeah, well,

74
00:03:38,399 --> 00:03:39,832
we both made mistakes, you know.

75
00:03:39,834 --> 00:03:42,802
I took the last breadstick,
you gushed over my ex-boyfriend

76
00:03:42,804 --> 00:03:47,006
like he was Leonard Nimoy
and you were my ex-boyfriend.

77
00:03:47,008 --> 00:03:49,375
So, to what do I owe
the pleasure?

78
00:03:49,377 --> 00:03:51,310
Well, I was wondering

79
00:03:51,312 --> 00:03:54,046
if you'd like to get dinner
again sometime.

80
00:03:54,048 --> 00:03:55,681
Yes, please.

81
00:03:55,683 --> 00:03:58,551
Great.
Let me just check

82
00:03:58,553 --> 00:04:00,353
my schedule, he said,

83
00:04:00,355 --> 00:04:03,189
trying to seem like a man
with things on his schedule.

84
00:04:03,191 --> 00:04:05,491
How 'bout Saturday?

85
00:04:05,493 --> 00:04:06,859
Uh, hmm...

86
00:04:06,861 --> 00:04:08,361
Let me see. Uh, Friday,

87
00:04:08,363 --> 00:04:10,029
farmers' market with Jay Z.

88
00:04:10,031 --> 00:04:13,032
Sunday, piano shopping
with Elton John.

89
00:04:13,034 --> 00:04:14,700
Saturday works.

90
00:04:16,838 --> 00:04:20,339
Oh. Did you know,
at the United Nations,

91
00:04:20,341 --> 00:04:23,042
there's a Department
for Outer Space Affairs?

92
00:04:23,044 --> 00:04:24,643
Really? Why?

93
00:04:24,645 --> 00:04:26,379
They exist
in case we ever make contact

94
00:04:26,381 --> 00:04:27,780
with an alien civilization.

95
00:04:27,782 --> 00:04:31,317
Mm, boy, that's one of those
jobs that's boring, boring,

96
00:04:31,319 --> 00:04:33,119
boring, then, "Oh, God!

97
00:04:33,121 --> 00:04:36,389
Where's the memo
with what we do now?!"

98
00:04:37,425 --> 00:04:39,058
Oh, this is cool.

99
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:41,427
So, a few weeks ago,
I set up a fan page

100
00:04:41,429 --> 00:04:44,163
on Facebook for our band and...
Wait a second.

101
00:04:44,165 --> 00:04:47,600
How could you do that
without consulting me?

102
00:04:47,602 --> 00:04:48,634
It's not a big deal.

103
00:04:48,636 --> 00:04:49,902
It just took, like,
five minutes to set up.

104
00:04:49,904 --> 00:04:51,504
That's not the point.

105
00:04:51,506 --> 00:04:54,340
When we created
Footprints on the Moon,

106
00:04:54,342 --> 00:04:58,043
we agreed that every band
decision would be mutual.

107
00:04:58,045 --> 00:05:00,346
Now you're just trying to
take over the whole thing.

108
00:05:00,348 --> 00:05:03,783
You know,
maybe I should go solo.

109
00:05:03,785 --> 00:05:05,818
But someone joined
our page.

110
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:07,787
We have an actual fan.

111
00:05:07,789 --> 00:05:09,688
All right.

112
00:05:09,690 --> 00:05:12,024
This thing's bigger than you
and me-- band's back together.

113
00:05:14,162 --> 00:05:15,594
So, listen to what he wrote.

114
00:05:15,596 --> 00:05:18,397
Uh, "I saw you play
at the comic book store.

115
00:05:18,399 --> 00:05:19,732
You guys rock."

116
00:05:19,734 --> 00:05:22,034
And then there's
a animated smiley face

117
00:05:22,036 --> 00:05:24,236
raising the roof like this...

118
00:05:26,174 --> 00:05:27,740
We did raise the roof
that night.

119
00:05:27,742 --> 00:05:29,375
Yeah, we totally did.
Why do rock stars

120
00:05:29,377 --> 00:05:32,845
do drugs when this feels so great?

121
00:05:35,149 --> 00:05:38,784
? Why can't I recall
this song? ?

122
00:05:39,554 --> 00:05:44,023
? This is taking
far too long. ?

123
00:05:44,025 --> 00:05:46,425
? The urge to bang my
head against the wall ?

124
00:05:46,427 --> 00:05:49,595
? Again and again and again and
again and again is strong. ?

125
00:05:49,597 --> 00:05:52,064
Put on some headphones.
? No ?

126
00:05:52,066 --> 00:05:54,533
? They make my earlobes sweat. ?

127
00:05:54,535 --> 00:05:56,869
Uh, sweetie, why don't
you take a break

128
00:05:56,871 --> 00:05:58,537
and do something
else for a while?

129
00:05:58,539 --> 00:06:01,674
There was a project I've
been thinking about starting.

130
00:06:01,676 --> 00:06:02,908
Okay, great. What is it?

131
00:06:02,910 --> 00:06:05,077
I'll show you.

132
00:06:07,949 --> 00:06:10,683
Dear Crazy Future Sheldon,

133
00:06:10,685 --> 00:06:13,018
you were driven mad
by an earworm.

134
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:15,387
Your mind,
once your most trusted asset,

135
00:06:15,389 --> 00:06:18,357
is now a sack of parrots
and monkeys.

136
00:06:18,359 --> 00:06:19,959
So...

137
00:06:19,961 --> 00:06:21,794
I'm going to tell you
everything you need to know.

138
00:06:21,796 --> 00:06:24,096
Uh, first, music is dangerous.

139
00:06:24,098 --> 00:06:27,333
The movie<i> Footloose</i> tried to
warn us, but we wouldn't listen.

140
00:06:27,335 --> 00:06:30,803
Oh, wait.
? Everybody cut footloo... ?

141
00:06:30,805 --> 00:06:32,304
Nope.

142
00:06:32,306 --> 00:06:36,642
I'll pay $1,000 to watch you
cut footloose.

143
00:06:37,512 --> 00:06:39,678
This is Penny.

144
00:06:40,515 --> 00:06:43,282
She is your friend.

145
00:06:43,284 --> 00:06:45,751
If she offers you food,
it's safe to take it.

146
00:06:45,753 --> 00:06:48,554
You probably
paid for it, anyway.

147
00:06:50,725 --> 00:06:52,758
So, you're really going out
with Dave again?

148
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:53,993
Why not?

149
00:06:53,995 --> 00:06:55,327
He's actually a very nice guy.

150
00:06:55,329 --> 00:06:57,196
But he spent an entire date

151
00:06:57,198 --> 00:06:59,532
talking about how much
he loves Sheldon.

152
00:06:59,534 --> 00:07:01,667
That's nothing Sheldon
hasn't done before.

153
00:07:03,638 --> 00:07:05,404
Dave's just a big
fan of his work.

154
00:07:05,406 --> 00:07:08,173
Besides, he said he
wouldn't bring it up again.

155
00:07:08,175 --> 00:07:10,409
Okay. So where's he taking you?

156
00:07:10,411 --> 00:07:13,479
Oh, he's coming here.
I'm actually making dinner.

157
00:07:13,481 --> 00:07:15,548
Oh. That's a big step.

158
00:07:15,550 --> 00:07:16,882
It is?

159
00:07:16,884 --> 00:07:19,318
Yeah. You're inviting him
into your home.

160
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:20,619
It's intimate.

161
00:07:20,621 --> 00:07:23,556
It's where your underpants live.

162
00:07:23,558 --> 00:07:25,891
You know what? Good.

163
00:07:25,893 --> 00:07:29,428
I tried to get back together
with Sheldon; he shot me down;

164
00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:30,829
Dave likes me.

165
00:07:30,831 --> 00:07:33,966
Maybe intimate
is what I need.

166
00:07:33,968 --> 00:07:35,267
You sure?

167
00:07:35,269 --> 00:07:38,003
You've never really been
with a man.

168
00:07:38,005 --> 00:07:42,241
Do you really want to start
with one that's six-foot-seven?

169
00:07:42,243 --> 00:07:44,343
Why not?

170
00:07:44,345 --> 00:07:47,646
'Cause it's like taking
your driver's test in a bus.

171
00:07:51,352 --> 00:07:54,720
Maybe we should post a comment
back to our fan and thank him.

172
00:07:54,722 --> 00:07:56,188
What should we write?

173
00:07:56,190 --> 00:07:58,924
How 'bout, uh...
Oh, how 'bout,

174
00:07:58,926 --> 00:08:00,726
"We might be
Footprints on the Moon,

175
00:08:00,728 --> 00:08:05,297
but your kind words sent
us over the moon."

176
00:08:05,299 --> 00:08:08,867
Someday you're gonna make
an amazing grandma.

177
00:08:08,869 --> 00:08:10,502
What do you
want to write?

178
00:08:10,504 --> 00:08:13,539
Something bad-ass,
you know, like...

179
00:08:13,541 --> 00:08:15,574
"Thanks for diggin' our vibe.

180
00:08:15,576 --> 00:08:17,343
"We'll keep rockin'

181
00:08:17,345 --> 00:08:20,679
if you keep rollin'."

182
00:08:20,681 --> 00:08:22,181
Dude, if I was wearing a bra,

183
00:08:22,183 --> 00:08:24,984
I'd throw it at
your head right now.

184
00:08:24,986 --> 00:08:27,753
I'll keep rockin'.
You don't do that.

185
00:08:29,757 --> 00:08:31,991
Okay. I posted it.

186
00:08:31,993 --> 00:08:33,492
So, who is this guy?

187
00:08:33,494 --> 00:08:37,129
Let's see.
Uh, his name is Trent Monaco.

188
00:08:37,131 --> 00:08:39,298
Cool name.
Yeah.

189
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:41,934
He's 24. He's a deejay.

190
00:08:41,936 --> 00:08:44,136
He brews his own beer.
He's got

191
00:08:44,138 --> 00:08:47,906
awesome tattoos. Dude, he's
got a hot girlfriend, too.

192
00:08:47,908 --> 00:08:52,111
Damn. I don't know if he's
our biggest fan or I'm his.

193
00:08:53,714 --> 00:08:55,881
Hey, Trent just liked
our comment.

194
00:08:55,883 --> 00:08:58,050
He is so cool!

195
00:08:58,052 --> 00:08:59,385
No hard feelings,

196
00:08:59,387 --> 00:09:01,987
but I'm throwing my
hypothetical bra at him.

197
00:09:14,268 --> 00:09:17,569
Oh, my God, he won't stop.

198
00:09:17,571 --> 00:09:21,240
How does he keep coming up
with new ways to be annoying?

199
00:09:21,242 --> 00:09:24,643
Nobody knows.
That's why he's number one.

200
00:09:25,946 --> 00:09:28,047
Can you please go talk
to him?

201
00:09:28,049 --> 00:09:30,883
Come on. I take care of him all
day long. You do it for once.

202
00:09:30,885 --> 00:09:33,952
Once? Who got the gum
out of his hair?

203
00:09:33,954 --> 00:09:37,656
What do you want, a medal?
It was your gum.

204
00:09:37,658 --> 00:09:40,659
Fine.

205
00:09:40,661 --> 00:09:41,794
I love you.

206
00:09:41,796 --> 00:09:43,162
Who cares?

207
00:09:45,933 --> 00:09:47,900
What are you
doing in my room? I...

208
00:09:47,902 --> 00:09:50,769
Stop it! That's mine!

209
00:09:50,771 --> 00:09:53,672
Why are you so strong?!

210
00:09:56,310 --> 00:09:58,410
Problem solved.

211
00:10:09,356 --> 00:10:11,190
Oh, yeah,
he got a tuba.

212
00:10:20,562 --> 00:10:24,564
Dear Crazy Future Sheldon...

213
00:10:24,566 --> 00:10:26,566
this is a thermostat.

214
00:10:26,568 --> 00:10:29,803
It controls the temperature
of the apartment.

215
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:33,540
The ideal setting is 72 degrees.

216
00:10:33,542 --> 00:10:36,576
If you find this too cold,
then put on a jacket.

217
00:10:36,578 --> 00:10:40,413
A straitjacket, 'cause 72's
the best and you're crazy.

218
00:10:41,283 --> 00:10:43,449
Now... this...

219
00:10:43,451 --> 00:10:45,318
is your spot.

220
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:47,554
You're very protective of it.

221
00:10:47,556 --> 00:10:49,522
When anyone else tries
to sit here,

222
00:10:49,524 --> 00:10:51,457
you berate them relentlessly.

223
00:10:51,459 --> 00:10:55,161
It sounds mean, but
somehow you make it adorable.

224
00:10:56,898 --> 00:10:59,799
People are also delighted
by your love of pranks.

225
00:11:00,936 --> 00:11:03,436
For example, Leonard has no idea

226
00:11:03,438 --> 00:11:04,904
what I did to his coffee.

227
00:11:07,042 --> 00:11:09,175
It wasn't "replace it
with Folger's crystals,"

228
00:11:09,177 --> 00:11:11,211
I'll tell you that much.

229
00:11:11,213 --> 00:11:13,847
Hey, can we please
get back to work?

230
00:11:13,849 --> 00:11:15,548
This is Leonard.

231
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:17,383
He's your best friend
in the world.

232
00:11:17,385 --> 00:11:19,786
All right, just stop.
This is ridiculous.

233
00:11:21,356 --> 00:11:23,857
Sometimes he gets cranky,

234
00:11:23,859 --> 00:11:26,693
but you can trust him
with your life.

235
00:11:26,695 --> 00:11:30,063
And he does more things for you
than I can even begin to list.

236
00:11:30,065 --> 00:11:33,266
Thank you.

237
00:11:33,268 --> 00:11:35,501
Oh, no, he's drinking it.

238
00:11:39,741 --> 00:11:40,940
Look at this.

239
00:11:40,942 --> 00:11:43,776
Trent is rebuilding
a vintage motorcycle.

240
00:11:43,778 --> 00:11:46,512
Hmm.
That is so cool!

241
00:11:46,514 --> 00:11:48,481
Old broken things
are so much better

242
00:11:48,483 --> 00:11:51,584
than new things that work.

243
00:11:51,586 --> 00:11:53,052
Who's Trent?

244
00:11:53,054 --> 00:11:54,287
Oh, he's our fan.

245
00:11:54,289 --> 00:11:56,389
- Fan of what?
- Uh...

246
00:11:56,391 --> 00:11:59,893
Did you forget?
We're in a band.

247
00:11:59,895 --> 00:12:02,629
You mean because you played one
time in the comic book store?

248
00:12:02,631 --> 00:12:06,566
And at the children's hospital
until they asked us to leave.

249
00:12:06,568 --> 00:12:08,034
Hey,

250
00:12:08,036 --> 00:12:11,070
dude, Trent just checked in at
the coffee shop on Fair Oaks.

251
00:12:11,072 --> 00:12:14,040
Really? You want to go
down there and meet him?

252
00:12:14,042 --> 00:12:16,309
Are you stalking him?
That's creepy.

253
00:12:16,311 --> 00:12:17,677
It's not creepy.

254
00:12:17,679 --> 00:12:20,013
I built a Footprints on the Moon
fan page, Trent joined it.

255
00:12:20,015 --> 00:12:22,048
After that, all I did was
check out his profile,

256
00:12:22,050 --> 00:12:23,549
go back in the archive
of his feed

257
00:12:23,551 --> 00:12:24,984
until I found
his Twitter handle.

258
00:12:24,986 --> 00:12:27,253
From there, it was easy to find
him on Instagram, Snapchat

259
00:12:27,255 --> 00:12:28,788
and pretty much track
his every movement.

260
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:31,858
So if you think that's creepy,
you married the wrong guy.

261
00:12:32,694 --> 00:12:34,694
Maybe I should marry Trent.

262
00:12:34,696 --> 00:12:37,897
Yeah, like she
could get Trent.

263
00:12:40,735 --> 00:12:42,101
This is delicious.

264
00:12:42,103 --> 00:12:43,336
Thank you.

265
00:12:43,338 --> 00:12:45,939
Been a long time since
I had a home-cooked meal.

266
00:12:45,941 --> 00:12:48,141
When you were married,
did your wife cook?

267
00:12:48,143 --> 00:12:49,809
Not at first, no.

268
00:12:49,811 --> 00:12:52,412
But when she began cheating
on me with a French chef,

269
00:12:52,414 --> 00:12:54,714
she became quite the wiz
in t kitchen.

270
00:12:54,716 --> 00:12:56,282
So, a little silver lining.

271
00:12:56,284 --> 00:12:57,650
I suppose.

272
00:12:57,652 --> 00:13:00,653
Yeah. Nothing takes the sting
out of a shattered life

273
00:13:00,655 --> 00:13:04,157
like a properly-seasoned
bowl of onion soup.

274
00:13:04,159 --> 00:13:06,793
How long have you,
uh, lived here?

275
00:13:06,795 --> 00:13:08,795
About five years.

276
00:13:08,797 --> 00:13:11,097
I'm actually thinking
of moving to a better place

277
00:13:11,099 --> 00:13:13,466
now that I don't need
to be so close to...

278
00:13:13,468 --> 00:13:14,968
Well, you know.

279
00:13:14,970 --> 00:13:16,869
I do. The brilliant physicist

280
00:13:16,871 --> 00:13:20,139
that I now know lives
in the area, not that I care.

281
00:13:20,141 --> 00:13:22,775
Yeah. Anyway, he doesn't drive,

282
00:13:22,777 --> 00:13:25,278
so, I pretty much had
to take him everywhere.

283
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:27,046
<i>Had</i> to or<i> got</i> to?

284
00:13:27,048 --> 00:13:28,214
Sorry.

285
00:13:28,216 --> 00:13:30,717
My fault. I brought him up.
Yeah.

286
00:13:30,719 --> 00:13:32,051
Well, let's change the subject.

287
00:13:32,053 --> 00:13:34,020
No more mentions
of you-know-who.

288
00:13:34,022 --> 00:13:35,755
That's a cool train.

289
00:13:35,757 --> 00:13:37,924
Where did you get that?

290
00:13:39,027 --> 00:13:41,928
? Bah, bah, bum-bum,
bah, bum, bum. ?

291
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:53,673
This song

292
00:13:53,675 --> 00:13:54,874
is never going to stop.

293
00:13:54,876 --> 00:13:56,409
Have you ever dealt
with something

294
00:13:56,411 --> 00:13:59,012
so relentlessly irritating?

295
00:13:59,881 --> 00:14:03,449
That's a trick
question, right?

296
00:14:03,451 --> 00:14:04,984
Well, I shouldn't
be surprised.

297
00:14:04,986 --> 00:14:06,486
There's a rich history of

298
00:14:06,488 --> 00:14:08,154
brilliant minds
descending into madness.

299
00:14:08,156 --> 00:14:09,655
Come on, Sheldon.

300
00:14:09,657 --> 00:14:12,358
There are plenty of smart people
who don't have mental problems.

301
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:13,493
Yup, she's right.

302
00:14:13,495 --> 00:14:15,461
For every Newton who had
a psychological issue,

303
00:14:15,463 --> 00:14:17,363
there's an Edison
who was just a jerk.

304
00:14:17,365 --> 00:14:19,766
That could
totally be you.

305
00:14:19,768 --> 00:14:23,636
Empedocles thought he was a god
and jumped into a volcano.

306
00:14:23,638 --> 00:14:25,204
And Pythagoras had

307
00:14:25,206 --> 00:14:26,873
an irrational fear of beans.

308
00:14:26,875 --> 00:14:29,242
Tesla fell madly in love
with a pigeon

309
00:14:29,244 --> 00:14:32,378
who he claimed loved him back.

310
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:35,515
Maybe he just had bread
in his pocket.

311
00:14:36,851 --> 00:14:38,785
The list extends
outside of science.

312
00:14:38,787 --> 00:14:41,754
Painters like Van Gogh
and Pollock,

313
00:14:41,756 --> 00:14:43,623
chess champion Bobby Fischer,

314
00:14:43,625 --> 00:14:46,592
Brian Wilson of the Beach Boy...

315
00:14:50,065 --> 00:14:52,999
? ...Know if words could say ?

316
00:14:53,001 --> 00:14:57,503
? But darlin',
I'll find a way... ?

317
00:14:57,505 --> 00:14:59,038
I remember the song!

318
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:00,907
It's called
"Darlin'" by the Beach Boys!

319
00:15:00,909 --> 00:15:02,408
Oh, thank goodness!

320
00:15:02,410 --> 00:15:04,811
I'm not crazy!

321
00:15:04,813 --> 00:15:07,480
I don't have
to take a pigeon as my bride!

322
00:15:09,784 --> 00:15:13,052
There goes our shot at
him living on the roof.

323
00:15:15,256 --> 00:15:18,458
So, all right, there he is.

324
00:15:19,294 --> 00:15:21,461
So, should we
introduce ourselves?

325
00:15:21,463 --> 00:15:24,030
No! Let him spot us.

326
00:15:24,032 --> 00:15:25,565
I wonder

327
00:15:25,567 --> 00:15:28,034
if he's listening
to our music right now.

328
00:15:28,036 --> 00:15:29,335
Could you imagine?

329
00:15:29,337 --> 00:15:31,270
What a cool way
for us to meet.

330
00:15:31,272 --> 00:15:34,740
He's playing our song and
looks up, and there we are--

331
00:15:34,742 --> 00:15:38,945
his favorite two-piece acoustic
sci-fi novelty rock band.

332
00:15:38,947 --> 00:15:40,413
And he's, all, like,

333
00:15:40,415 --> 00:15:43,583
"Aren't you the guys from
Footprints on the Moo...?"

334
00:15:43,585 --> 00:15:45,451
Ooh, what is he doing?!

335
00:15:48,823 --> 00:15:50,089
I can't watch.

336
00:15:50,091 --> 00:15:51,691
I-I-It's okay.

337
00:15:51,693 --> 00:15:53,559
Oh, it's okay.
He's done.

338
00:15:53,561 --> 00:15:55,761
Why is he looking at it?!

339
00:15:56,831 --> 00:16:00,199
Eh, no, he's not going
to eat it, is he?

340
00:16:00,201 --> 00:16:01,834
Come on, Trent,
you're better than...

341
00:16:06,474 --> 00:16:09,175
Let's just go.

342
00:16:09,177 --> 00:16:12,211
Hey, aren't you
the guys...?

343
00:16:12,213 --> 00:16:15,281
Nope!
Never heard of 'em!

344
00:16:16,384 --> 00:16:19,385
? ...Know if words could say ?

345
00:16:19,387 --> 00:16:20,820
? But darlin',
I'll find a way... ?

346
00:16:20,822 --> 00:16:22,722
I wonder why it was
this particular song

347
00:16:22,724 --> 00:16:24,257
that was stuck
in my head.

348
00:16:24,259 --> 00:16:25,958
I don't know.
It's pretty catchy.

349
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:27,560
Do you even like the Beach Boys?

350
00:16:27,562 --> 00:16:29,529
They have "beach"
right in the name.

351
00:16:29,531 --> 00:16:31,898
What do you think?

352
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:34,233
Well, now that you can focus
again, what do you say

353
00:16:34,235 --> 00:16:36,169
we get back to surface tension
of domain walls?

354
00:16:36,171 --> 00:16:38,838
Of course. I'm already
seeing a more efficient way

355
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:41,174
of taming the ultravi...

356
00:16:41,176 --> 00:16:43,609
I know why
the song was in my head.

357
00:16:43,611 --> 00:16:46,179
Why?
It's about Amy.

358
00:16:46,181 --> 00:16:48,548
Okay, look, I know
Amy's like an old lady,

359
00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:50,716
but she's not old enough
to have a song

360
00:16:50,718 --> 00:16:52,818
from the '60s written about her.

361
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:54,854
It's about
how she made my life better.

362
00:16:54,856 --> 00:16:56,222
Consider the lyrics.

363
00:16:56,224 --> 00:16:58,391
"I was living like half a man.

364
00:16:58,393 --> 00:17:00,860
"Then I couldn't love,
but now I can.

365
00:17:00,862 --> 00:17:02,061
"More soul than

366
00:17:02,063 --> 00:17:03,062
"I ever had.

367
00:17:03,064 --> 00:17:05,631
I love the way
you soften my life."

368
00:17:05,633 --> 00:17:08,568
Well, she did soften your life,
didn't she?

369
00:17:08,570 --> 00:17:09,936
Yes!

370
00:17:09,938 --> 00:17:12,505
She's like
the dryer sheets of my heart!

371
00:17:14,909 --> 00:17:16,108
I have to go.

372
00:17:18,313 --> 00:17:20,246
Aw.

373
00:17:20,248 --> 00:17:22,882
Am I like the dryer
sheets of your heart?

374
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:27,553
Better. You're the
lint trap of my love.

375
00:17:27,555 --> 00:17:29,555
Aw.

376
00:17:38,066 --> 00:17:39,732
That's an interesting
tie clip.

377
00:17:39,734 --> 00:17:40,900
Oh, thanks.

378
00:17:40,902 --> 00:17:42,668
It's, uh, Avogadro's constant.

379
00:17:42,670 --> 00:17:45,571
It's useful for calculating the
number of atoms in a substance,

380
00:17:45,573 --> 00:17:49,475
or causing regret
in anyone who asks about it.

381
00:17:49,477 --> 00:17:50,977
Oh, I...

382
00:17:50,979 --> 00:17:53,646
I think it's neat.

383
00:17:53,648 --> 00:17:55,448
Oh!
Sorry. Sorry.

384
00:17:55,450 --> 00:17:57,416
No one's ever liked
the tie clip before,

385
00:17:57,418 --> 00:18:00,253
so I just lost
all control. I...

386
00:18:00,255 --> 00:18:02,855
No, it... it's okay,
and we are on a date.

387
00:18:02,857 --> 00:18:05,291
I'm... I'm just
a little nervous.

388
00:18:05,293 --> 00:18:08,427
Well, no need
to be nervous with me.

389
00:18:08,429 --> 00:18:11,464
I'm just a harmless giant
from a foreign land.

390
00:18:14,402 --> 00:18:16,636
You know, I'm just
being silly. I...

391
00:18:16,638 --> 00:18:19,372
I don't know what
I'm waiting for.

392
00:18:22,043 --> 00:18:22,942
Amy?

393
00:18:22,944 --> 00:18:24,510
Amy.

394
00:18:24,512 --> 00:18:25,778
Amy?

395
00:18:26,848 --> 00:18:28,881
That's Sheldon.

396
00:18:28,883 --> 00:18:30,983
You're kidding!
How's my hair?

397
00:18:36,791 --> 00:18:39,191
Sheldon, this-this isn't
a good time.

398
00:18:39,193 --> 00:18:40,760
I don't care.

399
00:18:40,762 --> 00:18:43,329
Amy, there was a song I
couldn't get out of my head.

400
00:18:43,331 --> 00:18:46,532
Eventually, I realized
the song was about you,

401
00:18:46,534 --> 00:18:51,237
and like that earworm, I can't
get you out of my heart.

402
00:18:51,239 --> 00:18:54,006
So, what I'm trying to say is,

403
00:18:54,008 --> 00:18:57,076
you're my heartworm.

404
00:18:58,246 --> 00:19:02,615
The metaphorical kind, not-not
the poodle-killing kind.

405
00:19:02,617 --> 00:19:04,817
W-W-W-What?

406
00:19:04,819 --> 00:19:06,886
If I may...

407
00:19:06,888 --> 00:19:09,021
I believe
what he's saying,

408
00:19:09,023 --> 00:19:10,790
in a charming
and delightful way,

409
00:19:10,792 --> 00:19:12,792
is that he loves you
and wants you back.

410
00:19:12,794 --> 00:19:14,327
Dave Gibbs,
huge fan of your work.

411
00:19:14,329 --> 00:19:16,162
Oh.
Don't mind me.

412
00:19:19,367 --> 00:19:22,501
I'm-I'm sorry; I didn't
realize you were on a date.

413
00:19:22,503 --> 00:19:25,237
No, it-it... it's okay.
Keep going?

414
00:19:25,239 --> 00:19:27,873
Amy, if you want to be
my girlfriend again,

415
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:30,242
I really want to
be your boyfriend.

416
00:19:30,244 --> 00:19:33,012
I really want that, too.

417
00:19:33,014 --> 00:19:36,682
Good. Because I love you.

418
00:19:37,552 --> 00:19:40,653
I love you, too.

419
00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:44,857
Kiss her,
you brilliant fool!

420
00:19:58,906 --> 00:20:01,307
Well...

421
00:20:01,309 --> 00:20:03,776
I'll let you get
back to your date.

422
00:20:03,778 --> 00:20:05,978
Get back here!

423
00:20:05,980 --> 00:20:08,814
? Oh, oh, oh, darlin' ?

424
00:20:08,816 --> 00:20:12,118
? I dream about you often,
my pretty darlin' ?

425
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:14,687
? I love the way
you soften my... ?

426
00:20:30,696 --> 00:20:32,228
Okay, then.

427
00:20:33,966 --> 00:20:36,533
I'll, uh, see myself out.

428
00:20:37,602 --> 00:20:39,169
Amy, thank you for dinner.

429
00:20:40,605 --> 00:20:43,573
Dr. Cooper, pleasure
to meet you, sir.

430
00:20:45,377 --> 00:20:48,378
Uh, if perhaps sometime
you have a spare moment,

431
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:51,014
I'd, uh, love-love
to discuss physics,

432
00:20:51,016 --> 00:20:53,383
or "shoot the breeze,"
as you Yanks say.

433
00:20:59,094 --> 00:21:01,223
Ah. What a lovely evening.
