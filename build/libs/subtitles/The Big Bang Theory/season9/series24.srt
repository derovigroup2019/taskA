1
00:00:03,456 --> 00:00:04,356
Hey.

2
00:00:04,357 --> 00:00:05,923
Hi, how was the screening?

3
00:00:05,925 --> 00:00:07,725
Oh, Sheldon invoked Rosa Parks

4
00:00:07,727 --> 00:00:10,227
to make somebody who
cut the line feel bad,

5
00:00:10,229 --> 00:00:14,632
but only the
white people felt bad.

6
00:00:14,634 --> 00:00:16,834
Ugh, I should've never bought
him that coloring book

7
00:00:16,836 --> 00:00:19,603
that explains
Black History Month.

8
00:00:19,605 --> 00:00:21,038
How'd it go with my mother?

9
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:23,073
Uh, you know,
it started a little rocky,

10
00:00:23,075 --> 00:00:24,975
but I think we got
to a good place.

11
00:00:24,977 --> 00:00:26,010
Wow.

12
00:00:26,012 --> 00:00:27,278
Well done.
(chuckles)

13
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:28,479
Yeah, and when I dropped her off
at the hotel,

14
00:00:28,481 --> 00:00:29,480
she even gave me a hug.

15
00:00:29,482 --> 00:00:32,983
Did she think
you were choking or...

16
00:00:32,985 --> 00:00:34,418
I'm sorry, that's great.

17
00:00:34,420 --> 00:00:36,153
Thank you for
spending time with her.

18
00:00:36,155 --> 00:00:37,621
No problem.

19
00:00:37,623 --> 00:00:39,089
Um, so listen,

20
00:00:39,091 --> 00:00:41,892
I don't know if you have
any plans next weekend,

21
00:00:41,894 --> 00:00:43,694
but I kind of promised your mom

22
00:00:43,696 --> 00:00:45,195
we'd have another
wedding ceremony

23
00:00:45,197 --> 00:00:47,298
so she could attend this time.

24
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:50,367
Wait, we're gonna
get married again?

25
00:00:50,369 --> 00:00:53,471
Yeah, kind of, but now we can
invite our friends and family.

26
00:00:53,472 --> 00:00:56,173
Seems like a lot
of trouble for a hug.

27
00:00:56,174 --> 00:00:57,373
Come on, it'll be fun,

28
00:00:57,375 --> 00:00:59,008
and, you know, your mom
was genuinely hurt

29
00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:00,676
we didn't invite her
to the first one.

30
00:01:00,678 --> 00:01:02,077
Look, in our defense,

31
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:04,246
it was kind of a spur
of the moment thing,

32
00:01:04,248 --> 00:01:06,382
and also, we don't like her.

33
00:01:06,384 --> 00:01:07,950
Leonard, come on,
she's your mom.

34
00:01:07,952 --> 00:01:09,985
If we can do something
to make her happy,

35
00:01:09,987 --> 00:01:10,886
why wouldn't we?

36
00:01:10,888 --> 00:01:12,154
I just said why--

37
00:01:12,156 --> 00:01:13,889
we don't like her.

38
00:01:13,891 --> 00:01:15,191
Hey, look,
then forget about her,

39
00:01:15,193 --> 00:01:16,358
let's do it for us.

40
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:17,693
We could keep it
small and informal.

41
00:01:17,695 --> 00:01:19,161
This time we can
invite our families.

42
00:01:19,163 --> 00:01:20,496
Is your brother out of prison?

43
00:01:20,498 --> 00:01:22,665
Thanks to overcrowding, yeah.

44
00:01:22,667 --> 00:01:25,768
I'd love it
if my dad could come.

45
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:27,136
Oh, you have to invite him.

46
00:01:27,138 --> 00:01:28,604
I haven't seen him
since the divorce.

47
00:01:28,606 --> 00:01:30,506
Oh, he's like a different man.

48
00:01:30,508 --> 00:01:32,107
Oh.
He stopped twitching,

49
00:01:32,109 --> 00:01:34,577
and I think he grew
an inch and a half.

50
00:01:34,579 --> 00:01:36,478
Well, then it's settled.

51
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:37,813
Yay.

52
00:01:37,815 --> 00:01:38,814
God.

53
00:01:38,816 --> 00:01:39,982
So funny.

54
00:01:39,984 --> 00:01:42,418
I never thought my second
marriage would be to you!

55
00:01:44,121 --> 00:01:47,756
? Our whole universe
was in a hot, dense state ?

56
00:01:47,758 --> 00:01:51,093
? Then nearly 14 billion years
ago expansion started... Wait! ?

57
00:01:51,095 --> 00:01:52,695
? The Earth began to cool ?

58
00:01:52,697 --> 00:01:55,264
? The autotrophs began to drool,
Neanderthals developed tools ?

59
00:01:55,266 --> 00:01:57,933
? We built the Wall ?
? <i>We built the pyramids</i> ?

60
00:01:57,935 --> 00:02:00,603
? Math, Science, History,
unraveling the mystery ?

61
00:02:00,605 --> 00:02:02,504
? That all started
with a big bang ?

62
00:02:02,506 --> 00:02:04,473
? <i>Bang!</i> ?

65
00:02:13,534 --> 00:02:15,200
Okay, so it's not
a legal ceremony,

66
00:02:15,202 --> 00:02:16,368
it's just a chance for us

67
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:18,970
to redo our vows
so everyone can be part of it.

68
00:02:18,972 --> 00:02:22,474
So there's no maid of honor?

69
00:02:22,476 --> 00:02:23,408
No.

70
00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:26,578
Huh.

71
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:29,881
But if I were to, say,
wear a purple satin dress

72
00:02:29,883 --> 00:02:32,217
with a sweetheart neckline
and stand near you,

73
00:02:32,219 --> 00:02:34,653
you wouldn't be able
to stop me, right?

74
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:37,656
I don't see how I could.

75
00:02:37,658 --> 00:02:38,657
(chuckles)

76
00:02:38,659 --> 00:02:41,493
Then I graciously accept.

77
00:02:41,495 --> 00:02:42,994
Who's going to officiate?

78
00:02:42,996 --> 00:02:44,696
I was kind of hoping you would.

79
00:02:44,698 --> 00:02:47,599
Wait, now I'm just some
lousy maid of honor?

80
00:02:49,002 --> 00:02:51,269
Hey, good news, I just got off
the phone with my mother.

81
00:02:51,271 --> 00:02:52,337
She is coming to the wedding.

82
00:02:52,339 --> 00:02:54,072
Okay, wait,

83
00:02:54,074 --> 00:02:55,841
you're inviting people
to <i>our</i> wedding?

84
00:02:55,843 --> 00:02:59,745
Yes, I'm inviting
people to <i>our</i> wedding.

85
00:02:59,747 --> 00:03:01,012
Yeah, I've already asked

86
00:03:01,014 --> 00:03:03,382
Stephen Hawking
and Robert Downey Jr.

87
00:03:03,384 --> 00:03:04,983
And now, don't get your hopes
up, 'cause he's pretty busy,

88
00:03:04,985 --> 00:03:07,352
but Erno Rubik.

89
00:03:07,354 --> 00:03:09,354
Who's Erno Rubik?

90
00:03:09,356 --> 00:03:11,857
Seriously?

91
00:03:11,859 --> 00:03:13,325
He invented the Rubik's Cube.

92
00:03:13,327 --> 00:03:15,460
Okay, fine,

93
00:03:15,462 --> 00:03:17,129
but why would you invite him
to our wedding?

94
00:03:17,131 --> 00:03:19,431
Because, despite his fame
and fortune,

95
00:03:19,433 --> 00:03:21,933
he strikes me as a lonely man.

96
00:03:21,935 --> 00:03:24,136
Well, it's very sweet

97
00:03:24,138 --> 00:03:26,338
of you to go to all this trouble
for Leonard's mother.

98
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:27,939
Yeah, I'm also doing it
for Leonard.

99
00:03:27,941 --> 00:03:29,975
I think this could really help
their relationship.

100
00:03:29,977 --> 00:03:33,145
How dare you invite your father
without consulting me!

101
00:03:35,849 --> 00:03:38,150
Sorry, but I don't think
I need your permission

102
00:03:38,152 --> 00:03:40,285
to have my father at my wedding.

103
00:03:40,287 --> 00:03:42,821
You do understand our marriage
ended because he had an affair.

104
00:03:42,823 --> 00:03:43,889
I know,

105
00:03:43,891 --> 00:03:45,957
and there's no excuse for that.

106
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:49,528
He claimed I was cold,
emasculating,

107
00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:52,364
and hadn't shown him any
physical affection for years.

108
00:03:52,366 --> 00:03:55,867
I was wrong, there's
three excuses for that.

Oh, my God.

111
00:04:08,549 --> 00:04:09,481
It's working.

112
00:04:09,483 --> 00:04:11,049
You sure?

113
00:04:11,051 --> 00:04:12,083
Look.

114
00:04:12,085 --> 00:04:13,785
The system is maintaining
its own stability,

115
00:04:13,787 --> 00:04:16,721
the quantum vortex apparatus is
now controlling the orientation.

116
00:04:16,723 --> 00:04:18,457
(inhales)

117
00:04:18,459 --> 00:04:20,592
You're right.

118
00:04:20,594 --> 00:04:21,927
You realize what this means?

119
00:04:21,929 --> 00:04:23,795
Yeah.

120
00:04:23,797 --> 00:04:25,564
I do.

121
00:04:25,566 --> 00:04:28,834
It's proof of concept.

122
00:04:28,836 --> 00:04:30,702
We've got a
workable guidance system.

123
00:04:30,704 --> 00:04:33,738
Congratulations.

124
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:37,442
Thanks!

126
00:04:38,812 --> 00:04:40,178
Hey,

127
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:43,548
I just got an e-mail
from the U.S. Air Force.

128
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:45,350
Open it.

129
00:04:45,352 --> 00:04:46,551
Hmm.

130
00:04:46,553 --> 00:04:48,487
"We request a meeting at your
earliest convenience

131
00:04:48,489 --> 00:04:50,288
"regarding your
quantum guidance system,

132
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:53,859
provisional patent 62/295118."

133
00:04:53,861 --> 00:04:57,028
That's weird.

134
00:04:57,030 --> 00:05:01,233
Is there a window around
here we don't know about?

135
00:05:01,235 --> 00:05:03,468
I'm sure
it's just a coincidence.

136
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:04,436
Yeah, of course.

137
00:05:04,438 --> 00:05:05,904
What else could it be?

138
00:05:05,906 --> 00:05:09,941
(raised voice):
Boy, do I love America.

139
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:14,145
Thank you for picking me up.

140
00:05:14,147 --> 00:05:16,615
Oh, you're welcome.

141
00:05:16,617 --> 00:05:18,984
I was speaking to
your young lady.

142
00:05:18,986 --> 00:05:20,685
My pleasure, Mrs. Cooper.

143
00:05:20,687 --> 00:05:21,953
Oh, please call me Mary.

144
00:05:21,955 --> 00:05:24,389
Okay, Mary.

145
00:05:25,626 --> 00:05:27,359
You know,
that doesn't work for me,

146
00:05:27,361 --> 00:05:29,594
let's stay with Mrs. Cooper.

147
00:05:29,596 --> 00:05:31,563
Sheldon, don't be silly.

148
00:05:31,565 --> 00:05:32,998
Wait, what?

149
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,160
That's what I called you
till I got to know you better.

150
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:39,771
It was so nice of Leonard
and Penny to invite me.

151
00:05:39,773 --> 00:05:42,641
Well, actually, I...
It sure was.

152
00:05:42,643 --> 00:05:45,644
I've always had a special place
in my heart for Leonard.

153
00:05:45,646 --> 00:05:47,279
Taking care of my baby
all these years.

154
00:05:47,281 --> 00:05:49,114
Excuse me,

155
00:05:49,116 --> 00:05:50,348
I take care of <i>him.</i>

156
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:52,317
Sure you do.

157
00:05:53,186 --> 00:05:55,887
So who else is coming
to this shindig?

158
00:05:55,889 --> 00:05:57,489
Oh, well, the usual gang.

159
00:05:57,491 --> 00:05:59,357
Penny's family
is coming tomorrow.

160
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:00,859
Yeah, and Leonard's mother's
already here.

161
00:06:00,861 --> 00:06:02,427
Oh, Beverly.

162
00:06:02,429 --> 00:06:03,828
How nice.

163
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:06,097
You've met her, right?

164
00:06:06,099 --> 00:06:08,867
Yes, I have.

165
00:06:10,704 --> 00:06:12,170
Mother, she's an atheist,

166
00:06:12,172 --> 00:06:14,806
not a vampire.

167
00:06:14,808 --> 00:06:18,810
Either way, let's stop
and get some garlic.

168
00:06:30,724 --> 00:06:33,124
So, Mary, how have you been?

169
00:06:33,126 --> 00:06:34,392
Well, thank you
so much for asking.

170
00:06:34,394 --> 00:06:35,427
I've been well, and you?

171
00:06:35,429 --> 00:06:38,763
Very good.
Good.

172
00:06:38,765 --> 00:06:40,465
I don't know what

173
00:06:40,467 --> 00:06:44,235
we were worried about;
they're getting along great.

174
00:06:44,237 --> 00:06:46,404
Sheldon tells me
your husband's coming.

175
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:47,439
My ex-husband.

176
00:06:47,441 --> 00:06:48,573
Oh, I'm so sorry.

177
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:49,341
Don't be.

178
00:06:49,343 --> 00:06:50,976
All right.

179
00:06:50,978 --> 00:06:53,278
Whew, chilly.

180
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,180
I think I can see my breath.

181
00:06:55,182 --> 00:06:56,081
We can hear you.

182
00:06:56,083 --> 00:06:58,216
Sorry.
Sorry.

183
00:06:59,453 --> 00:07:01,920
I can't believe I was so naive.

184
00:07:01,922 --> 00:07:04,089
The military is just gonna

185
00:07:04,091 --> 00:07:05,857
take over the whole project.

186
00:07:05,859 --> 00:07:08,660
And you know what happens
if we object?

187
00:07:08,662 --> 00:07:09,894
We disappear.

188
00:07:09,896 --> 00:07:11,062
(nervous chuckle)

189
00:07:11,064 --> 00:07:12,263
Like off the map.

190
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:14,699
Like every <i>American Idol</i> winner
since season four.

191
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:19,170
Come on, Howard,
you're overreacting.

192
00:07:19,172 --> 00:07:20,939
Am I?

193
00:07:20,941 --> 00:07:24,142
(whispers):
Am I?

194
00:07:24,144 --> 00:07:26,811
Wha-- what do you want to bet
some black ops guy

195
00:07:26,813 --> 00:07:28,813
is reprinting
my high school yearbook

196
00:07:28,815 --> 00:07:31,549
and I'm no longer in it?

197
00:07:31,551 --> 00:07:33,752
That chess club picture is now

198
00:07:33,754 --> 00:07:35,620
just David Zimmerman
and Elaine Cho.

199
00:07:35,622 --> 00:07:39,557
Okay, look,
I'm on the Air Force Web site,

200
00:07:39,559 --> 00:07:40,692
and the department
that e-mailed you

201
00:07:40,694 --> 00:07:41,793
is in charge of acquisitions.

202
00:07:41,795 --> 00:07:43,395
So maybe they just
want to give you

203
00:07:43,397 --> 00:07:44,896
a lot of money
for your invention.

204
00:07:44,898 --> 00:07:47,332
Oh, please, that's
not how it works.

205
00:07:47,334 --> 00:07:49,934
You saw <i>E.T., Avatar,</i>
<i>Jurassic World.</i>

206
00:07:49,936 --> 00:07:54,239
The military just shows up
and takes over.

207
00:07:54,241 --> 00:07:57,008
You do realize those weren't
documentaries, right?

208
00:07:57,010 --> 00:07:59,477
(chuckles)

209
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:01,212
I'm sorry, you find this funny?

210
00:08:01,214 --> 00:08:03,782
No, I was just thinking
about <i>Jurassic World.</i>

211
00:08:03,784 --> 00:08:05,784
Boy, that was terrible.

212
00:08:15,462 --> 00:08:16,695
Oh, we have to use the stairs.

213
00:08:16,697 --> 00:08:18,496
When are they gonna fix
your elevator?

214
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:20,331
Uh... I don't-- any day now.

215
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:24,102
Well, the stairs are fine.

216
00:08:24,104 --> 00:08:27,505
Besides, your
mother is up there.

217
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:30,341
Maybe I'll have a heart attack
and not have to see her.

218
00:08:33,013 --> 00:08:35,313
Hey, I, I know things
are a little rough

219
00:08:35,315 --> 00:08:36,681
with you and Mom,

220
00:08:36,683 --> 00:08:38,783
but I'm really
glad you're here.

221
00:08:38,785 --> 00:08:40,552
Me, too.
(chuckles)

222
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:47,192
I should have never had that
angioplasty because I feel fine.

223
00:08:50,464 --> 00:08:52,497
Penny's really looking
forward to seeing you.

224
00:08:52,499 --> 00:08:54,332
Ah, she's a sweetie.

225
00:08:54,334 --> 00:08:56,735
You got a good one there,
Leonard.

226
00:08:56,737 --> 00:08:59,437
Thanks, Dad.

227
00:08:59,439 --> 00:09:02,540
How the hell did you do that?

228
00:09:03,744 --> 00:09:05,677
(celery crunches loudly)

229
00:09:19,159 --> 00:09:20,658
(loud crunching)

230
00:09:26,066 --> 00:09:27,699
Isn't this nice?

231
00:09:27,701 --> 00:09:28,967
(door opens)

232
00:09:28,969 --> 00:09:30,368
Hey, we're here.

233
00:09:30,370 --> 00:09:31,569
Alfred!

234
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:33,271
Thank you for coming!
Oh.

235
00:09:33,273 --> 00:09:34,672
Well, happy to be here.

236
00:09:34,674 --> 00:09:36,508
And congratulations.
Thank you.

237
00:09:36,510 --> 00:09:37,909
Dad, you remember Sheldon.

238
00:09:37,911 --> 00:09:38,877
Dr. Hofstadter.

239
00:09:38,879 --> 00:09:40,345
Dr. Cooper.

240
00:09:40,347 --> 00:09:41,980
This is Sheldon's mother, Mary.
How do you do?

241
00:09:41,982 --> 00:09:43,181
Nice to meet you.

242
00:09:43,183 --> 00:09:44,349
And his girlfriend, Amy.

243
00:09:44,351 --> 00:09:45,950
A pleasure.
Hi.

244
00:09:45,952 --> 00:09:47,185
And, of course, Mom.

245
00:09:47,187 --> 00:09:49,387
Hello, my hateful shrew.

246
00:09:52,459 --> 00:09:55,994
Hello to you,
you wrinkled old bastard.

247
00:09:58,231 --> 00:10:01,866
All right, now I'm starting
to sense a little tension.

248
00:10:10,465 --> 00:10:12,265
All right, you two, don't start.

249
00:10:12,267 --> 00:10:15,434
Penny and I are throwing this
second wedding for your benefit.

250
00:10:15,436 --> 00:10:16,936
Can you please not ruin it?

251
00:10:16,938 --> 00:10:18,638
Of course. I'm sorry.

252
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:20,239
Oh, look at that--
you can apologize.

253
00:10:20,241 --> 00:10:22,241
Mom!
I'm sorry.

254
00:10:23,144 --> 00:10:24,343
You know, the Bible
says forgiveness...

255
00:10:24,345 --> 00:10:26,212
Mom!
I'm sorry.

256
00:10:27,782 --> 00:10:28,981
Uh, who's hungry?

257
00:10:28,983 --> 00:10:30,716
We have a reservation
at the best restaurant in town.

258
00:10:30,718 --> 00:10:32,552
It only got three-and-a-half
stars on Yelp.

259
00:10:32,554 --> 00:10:35,121
Sheldon!
I'm not sorry. That's true.

260
00:10:37,592 --> 00:10:38,758
I don't know what to do.

261
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:40,059
It's the Air Force.

262
00:10:40,061 --> 00:10:42,061
I mean, should I respond
to their e-mail?

263
00:10:42,063 --> 00:10:43,296
Ignore it?

264
00:10:43,298 --> 00:10:44,597
You can't ignore it.

265
00:10:44,599 --> 00:10:46,065
It's not that postcard
that says it's time

266
00:10:46,067 --> 00:10:47,800
to go back to the dentist.

267
00:10:49,170 --> 00:10:50,203
Guys, come on.

268
00:10:50,205 --> 00:10:51,304
We're meeting everyone
for dinner.

269
00:10:51,306 --> 00:10:52,438
One sec. I'm just afraid

270
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:54,473
if I respond,
then they'll know I got it.

271
00:10:54,475 --> 00:10:55,575
Oh, dude.

272
00:10:55,577 --> 00:10:56,876
The minute you opened
that e-mail,

273
00:10:56,878 --> 00:10:57,977
they knew you got it.

274
00:10:57,979 --> 00:10:59,111
I mean, they're probably
looking at you

275
00:10:59,113 --> 00:11:01,380
through the camera right now.
Oh, damn.

276
00:11:03,284 --> 00:11:04,951
I love America.

277
00:11:07,589 --> 00:11:09,021
Are you done with this nonsense?

278
00:11:09,023 --> 00:11:10,256
It's not nonsense.

279
00:11:10,258 --> 00:11:12,191
This is how the
U.S. military works.

280
00:11:12,193 --> 00:11:13,759
Oh, if it's even
the U.S. military.

281
00:11:13,761 --> 00:11:16,629
It could be foreign military
pretending to be American.

282
00:11:16,631 --> 00:11:19,031
You're right. We turn our
guidance system over to them,

283
00:11:19,033 --> 00:11:21,467
next thing we know,
they're using it against us.

284
00:11:23,238 --> 00:11:26,005
I also love the enemies
of America.

285
00:11:35,083 --> 00:11:38,117
Penny, I hope the example
of my failed marriage

286
00:11:38,119 --> 00:11:40,519
to Leonard's father
doesn't discourage you

287
00:11:40,521 --> 00:11:42,788
from the commitment
you've made to one another.

288
00:11:42,790 --> 00:11:45,958
Oh, of course not.

289
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:50,029
Although Alfred and I had a lot
more going for us than you two.

290
00:11:51,599 --> 00:11:55,001
Mom, please save something
for the toast.

291
00:11:59,140 --> 00:12:02,141
So, Alfred, what is it
that you do for a living?

292
00:12:02,143 --> 00:12:03,409
Oh, I'm an anthropologist.

293
00:12:03,411 --> 00:12:06,112
I study ancient peoples
and cultures.

294
00:12:06,114 --> 00:12:08,114
My goodness, so all the way
back to the Flood.

295
00:12:08,116 --> 00:12:10,983
(laughing)

296
00:12:10,985 --> 00:12:13,486
Don't laugh--
she wasn't joking.

297
00:12:13,488 --> 00:12:15,821
Play with your phone.

298
00:12:19,394 --> 00:12:21,093
Well, on that note,

299
00:12:21,095 --> 00:12:23,963
there are many cultures
that have an apocalyptic flood

300
00:12:23,965 --> 00:12:25,464
as part of their mythology.

301
00:12:25,466 --> 00:12:27,166
I don't have a mythology.

302
00:12:27,168 --> 00:12:28,901
I have the unerring Word of God.

303
00:12:28,903 --> 00:12:30,303
But that's very interesting.

304
00:12:30,305 --> 00:12:31,570
Oh.

305
00:12:31,572 --> 00:12:33,673
I-I didn't mean to
disparage your faith.

306
00:12:33,675 --> 00:12:35,441
Actually, I admire it.

307
00:12:35,443 --> 00:12:36,709
Really?
Yes.

308
00:12:36,711 --> 00:12:38,177
Yes, I'm an agnostic myself,

309
00:12:38,179 --> 00:12:40,479
but I have prayed,
many times, to God,

310
00:12:40,481 --> 00:12:44,016
to turn my wife
into a pillar of salt.

311
00:12:44,852 --> 00:12:46,152
Well, He came close.

312
00:12:46,154 --> 00:12:48,187
Turned her into
a giant block of ice.

313
00:12:48,189 --> 00:12:50,690
(both laughing)

314
00:12:53,194 --> 00:12:55,061
Howard, there must be someone
at the university

315
00:12:55,063 --> 00:12:56,329
you can go to for help.

316
00:12:56,331 --> 00:12:57,897
Are you kidding?

317
00:12:57,899 --> 00:12:59,465
They're probably the ones
who leaked it

318
00:12:59,467 --> 00:13:01,267
to the military
in the first place.

319
00:13:02,403 --> 00:13:05,271
What about the guy
on the Channel Four News?

320
00:13:05,273 --> 00:13:07,473
You know,
"Four on Your Side"?

321
00:13:07,475 --> 00:13:09,375
Maybe he can be on <i>your</i> side.

322
00:13:10,845 --> 00:13:13,145
I'm being harassed
by the government,

323
00:13:13,147 --> 00:13:16,749
not trying to get to the bottom
of a dog-walking scam.

324
00:13:18,052 --> 00:13:19,585
Oh, stop!

325
00:13:19,587 --> 00:13:21,153
You know what's
really happening?

326
00:13:21,155 --> 00:13:22,688
All the movies
you've watched,

327
00:13:22,690 --> 00:13:24,090
the TV shows, the comic books--

328
00:13:24,092 --> 00:13:25,791
they've completely twisted
your thinking.

329
00:13:25,793 --> 00:13:27,360
No one's after you,
no one's listening to you,

330
00:13:27,362 --> 00:13:29,395
no one cares about you.

331
00:13:31,199 --> 00:13:32,431
I'd like to think

332
00:13:32,433 --> 00:13:34,934
the "Four on Your Side" guy
cares about me.

333
00:13:37,905 --> 00:13:39,972
You know, Beverly,
I know you and Alfred

334
00:13:39,974 --> 00:13:42,675
have your differences,
but if you think about it,

335
00:13:42,677 --> 00:13:45,277
if you hadn't married him,
there'd be no Leonard.

336
00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:46,479
(chuckles)

337
00:13:46,481 --> 00:13:47,980
So that's good, right?

338
00:13:47,982 --> 00:13:49,014
Eh.

339
00:13:54,722 --> 00:13:57,189
Is that Howard
in front of us?

340
00:13:57,191 --> 00:13:58,758
Oh, maybe.

341
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:00,659
Get closer.

342
00:14:02,296 --> 00:14:03,963
Oh, God.

343
00:14:03,965 --> 00:14:06,766
I think someone's
following us.

344
00:14:06,768 --> 00:14:09,068
You're being ridiculous.

345
00:14:09,070 --> 00:14:11,837
I'm not being ridiculous--
he's right on my tail.

346
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:14,807
Uh, turn left here
and see if he turns with us.

347
00:14:15,877 --> 00:14:17,977
Well, why is
he turning here?

348
00:14:17,979 --> 00:14:19,845
The restaurant's the other way.
I don't know.

349
00:14:19,847 --> 00:14:22,214
He uses that traffic app.
Maybe there's an accident.

350
00:14:22,216 --> 00:14:23,716
Oh, so follow him.

351
00:14:26,254 --> 00:14:27,520
Oh, no!

352
00:14:29,690 --> 00:14:31,524
I told you!

353
00:14:31,526 --> 00:14:34,126
It's probably
just a coincidence.

354
00:14:34,128 --> 00:14:36,762
Speed up a little,
see if he stays with you.

355
00:14:36,764 --> 00:14:38,297
Well, go faster.

356
00:14:38,299 --> 00:14:39,665
You're losing him.
What is his hurry?

357
00:14:39,667 --> 00:14:40,966
You know what,
flash your lights.

358
00:14:40,968 --> 00:14:42,234
Let him know it's you.

359
00:14:43,070 --> 00:14:44,570
He's flashing his lights.

360
00:14:44,572 --> 00:14:46,005
What's that mean?

361
00:14:46,007 --> 00:14:47,807
I-I think he wants us
to pull over.

362
00:14:47,809 --> 00:14:49,341
Do not pull over!

363
00:14:49,343 --> 00:14:50,743
I'm not raising this baby alone!

364
00:14:52,780 --> 00:14:53,879
Hang on!

365
00:14:53,881 --> 00:14:56,148
(engine revving)

366
00:14:57,351 --> 00:15:00,352
So, after
your husband passed,

367
00:15:00,354 --> 00:15:02,021
you never remarried?

368
00:15:02,023 --> 00:15:04,557
No, just focused on work
and the church.

369
00:15:04,559 --> 00:15:05,825
Ah. And what do you do?

370
00:15:05,827 --> 00:15:08,027
I work at the church.

371
00:15:09,363 --> 00:15:11,330
Well, they're lucky
to have you.

372
00:15:11,332 --> 00:15:13,299
MARY:
Well, thank you.

373
00:15:13,301 --> 00:15:15,367
You're welcome.

374
00:15:15,369 --> 00:15:17,503
Do you realize
what's happening here?

375
00:15:17,505 --> 00:15:19,071
Yeah, I do.

376
00:15:19,073 --> 00:15:21,774
They're filling up on bread
and ruining their meal.

377
00:15:25,313 --> 00:15:26,345
Hey.
AMY: Hey.

378
00:15:26,347 --> 00:15:27,913
What took you guys so long?

379
00:15:27,915 --> 00:15:30,082
Oh, we were following Howard,
but for some reason,

380
00:15:30,084 --> 00:15:32,751
he turned off his headlights
and went up a one-way street.

381
00:15:34,322 --> 00:15:35,888
So, what did we miss?

382
00:15:35,890 --> 00:15:37,990
Oh, just Mary and I getting
to know each other a little.

383
00:15:37,992 --> 00:15:40,292
Leonard, your father
is just charming.

384
00:15:40,294 --> 00:15:41,327
He's also broke.

385
00:15:41,329 --> 00:15:42,761
Did he mention that?

386
00:15:44,999 --> 00:15:48,067
Okay, Mom,
you sit over there...

387
00:15:49,504 --> 00:15:51,871
And I'm gonna call Bernadette
and see what's keeping them.

388
00:15:53,274 --> 00:15:54,974
If I'd known you were broke,

389
00:15:54,976 --> 00:15:57,243
I wouldn't have made
a big deal about the bread.

390
00:16:02,316 --> 00:16:03,749
Hey, Penny.

391
00:16:04,752 --> 00:16:06,252
What are you talking about?

392
00:16:08,489 --> 00:16:10,589
Oh, that was you?

393
00:16:10,591 --> 00:16:12,091
(chuckles)

394
00:16:12,093 --> 00:16:13,592
Long story.

395
00:16:13,594 --> 00:16:15,127
Why don't you go ahead and eat.

396
00:16:15,129 --> 00:16:16,428
We're gonna be a while.

397
00:16:20,668 --> 00:16:22,935
I'm telling you,
I'm not on drugs.

398
00:16:22,937 --> 00:16:25,938
The government's out to get me!

399
00:16:28,676 --> 00:16:31,544
Now, one of the more exciting
things to be found recently

400
00:16:31,546 --> 00:16:33,078
is that Neanderthals

401
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:36,482
and Homo sapiens frequently
mated with each other.

402
00:16:36,484 --> 00:16:39,852
Well, that certainly explains
my marriage to Sheldon's father.

403
00:16:39,854 --> 00:16:41,620
(laughs)

404
00:16:42,857 --> 00:16:46,592
That's funny, because my father
was not a very clever man.

405
00:16:47,461 --> 00:16:49,261
I'd be lost without you.

406
00:16:51,499 --> 00:16:52,464
(utensil clinking on glass)

407
00:16:52,466 --> 00:16:54,667
Uh, I would like
to propose a toast

408
00:16:54,669 --> 00:16:56,569
to my wife and bride-to-be.

409
00:16:56,571 --> 00:16:57,836
See, that's funny because...

410
00:16:57,838 --> 00:16:59,004
Back to your phone.

411
00:17:01,842 --> 00:17:03,676
Penny...

412
00:17:03,678 --> 00:17:05,744
I've always known I loved you,

413
00:17:05,746 --> 00:17:08,247
but this last year has shown me

414
00:17:08,249 --> 00:17:10,482
that I also love
being married to you.

415
00:17:10,484 --> 00:17:12,985
Thank you
for saying yes.

416
00:17:12,987 --> 00:17:16,121
Oh, thanks for asking
until I did.

417
00:17:16,958 --> 00:17:18,157
Hear, hear.

418
00:17:18,159 --> 00:17:19,391
Cheers.

419
00:17:20,861 --> 00:17:23,395
I, uh, I would also like
to make a toast.

420
00:17:23,397 --> 00:17:24,363
Aw.

421
00:17:24,365 --> 00:17:26,265
(chuckles)
Leonard,

422
00:17:26,267 --> 00:17:28,534
I am so happy
that you have found a woman

423
00:17:28,536 --> 00:17:30,469
who loves and cares for you.

424
00:17:30,471 --> 00:17:32,638
What the hell is that
supposed to mean?

425
00:17:34,575 --> 00:17:36,408
Why don't you take a pill?

426
00:17:36,410 --> 00:17:38,110
Like you did before sex?

427
00:17:38,112 --> 00:17:39,845
What I really needed

428
00:17:39,847 --> 00:17:41,647
was a blindfold.

429
00:17:41,649 --> 00:17:43,215
All right, everyone...

430
00:17:43,217 --> 00:17:44,683
calm down.

431
00:17:44,685 --> 00:17:46,418
Let's all remember what
it says in the Bible:

432
00:17:46,420 --> 00:17:48,554
"He who is slow to anger

433
00:17:48,556 --> 00:17:50,789
is better than the mighty."

434
00:17:50,791 --> 00:17:53,993
Oh, dear woman, can you please
read another book?

435
00:17:55,029 --> 00:17:58,397
When God writes one, I will.

436
00:18:00,735 --> 00:18:02,001
(clears throat)

437
00:18:04,472 --> 00:18:07,840
Um, if-if we want to order
the souffl?,

438
00:18:07,842 --> 00:18:10,042
we might want to get on that.

439
00:18:14,015 --> 00:18:16,482
Leonard, if you don't mind,
I-I think I'm a little tired.

440
00:18:16,484 --> 00:18:17,683
I'm gonna call it a night.

441
00:18:17,685 --> 00:18:19,184
Sure, Dad.

442
00:18:19,186 --> 00:18:21,053
I'm a little
tuckered out myself,

443
00:18:21,055 --> 00:18:23,188
so I will see you all
in the morning.

444
00:18:24,225 --> 00:18:25,724
Would you like
to share a cab?

445
00:18:25,726 --> 00:18:26,925
That would be fine.

446
00:18:26,927 --> 00:18:28,560
Where are you staying?
I'm at the Westin.

447
00:18:28,562 --> 00:18:29,795
Oh, so am I.

448
00:18:29,797 --> 00:18:31,130
Can I interest you
in a nightcap?

449
00:18:31,132 --> 00:18:33,565
I think that you could.

450
00:18:38,305 --> 00:18:40,572
What is happening there?

451
00:18:40,574 --> 00:18:43,108
I think it's pretty obvious.

452
00:18:43,110 --> 00:18:45,444
They don't want dessert
'cause they filled up on bread.

453
00:18:56,612 --> 00:18:58,412
She's still not answering.

454
00:18:59,615 --> 00:19:02,616
My father's not texting me back.

455
00:19:04,453 --> 00:19:07,621
(singsongy): 'Cause they both
turned their phones off.

456
00:19:12,661 --> 00:19:15,796
I don't like this at all.

457
00:19:15,798 --> 00:19:17,431
I don't like it either.

458
00:19:17,433 --> 00:19:18,699
Really?

459
00:19:18,701 --> 00:19:20,768
(laughing):
'Cause I love it.
