00:00:02,147 --> 00:00:04,257
Oh, look at all
that chest hair.

3
00:00:04,358 --> 00:00:05,390
And overbite.

4
00:00:05,392 --> 00:00:07,225
Of course you're a Wolowitz.

5
00:00:09,029 --> 00:00:11,563
Son of a bitch, he bit me.

6
00:00:11,565 --> 00:00:15,000
Okay, I guess I'll just go to
the emergency room to be safe.

7
00:00:15,002 --> 00:00:17,769
Howie, this is just
your hypochondria.

8
00:00:17,771 --> 00:00:20,105
When I sat on the mute button
and thought I'd gone deaf,

9
00:00:20,107 --> 00:00:21,940
that was my hypochondria.

11
00:00:30,718 --> 00:00:34,219
We'll find another time
to tell him I'm pregnant.

12
00:00:38,158 --> 00:00:39,491
Morning.

13
00:00:39,493 --> 00:00:40,792
Morning.

14
00:00:40,794 --> 00:00:42,461
"We"?

15
00:00:42,463 --> 00:00:43,862
What is this?

16
00:00:43,864 --> 00:00:45,063
I don't know.

17
00:00:45,065 --> 00:00:46,665
Maybe it says
something on the back.

18
00:00:48,235 --> 00:00:51,203
"Continued on milk."

19
00:00:51,205 --> 00:00:53,271
If you're tricking me
into making my own breakfast,

20
00:00:53,273 --> 00:00:55,440
it didn't work for my mom,
and it won't work for you.

21
00:00:57,244 --> 00:00:58,243
"Are."

22
00:00:58,245 --> 00:01:00,912
"We are..."

23
00:01:00,914 --> 00:01:02,581
"See spoons for more."

24
00:01:03,917 --> 00:01:05,317
What could it be?

25
00:01:05,319 --> 00:01:06,651
"We are Groot"?

26
00:01:06,653 --> 00:01:08,320
"We are the champions"?

27
00:01:08,322 --> 00:01:09,988
"We are family"?

28
00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:11,823
"I got all my sisters with me."

29
00:01:16,163 --> 00:01:17,462
Are you serious?

30
00:01:17,464 --> 00:01:19,631
Yeah.

31
00:01:19,633 --> 00:01:22,934
Are you sure?

32
00:01:24,405 --> 00:01:26,705
Pretty positive.

33
00:01:26,707 --> 00:01:28,507
That's a joke, because
the pregnancy test says...

34
00:01:28,509 --> 00:01:30,041
Oh, my God.

35
00:01:32,846 --> 00:01:34,379
This is incredible.

36
00:01:34,381 --> 00:01:36,982
We're gonna be parents?

37
00:01:36,984 --> 00:01:40,452
We're gonna get
to board planes first.

38
00:01:41,588 --> 00:01:43,221
Finally gonna get to see

39
00:01:43,223 --> 00:01:46,725
what's in that family bathroom
at the mall.

40
00:01:46,727 --> 00:01:48,860
I know, it's crazy.

41
00:01:48,862 --> 00:01:50,962
It is crazy.

42
00:01:50,964 --> 00:01:52,264
Oh.

43
00:01:52,266 --> 00:01:56,001
I mean, how do you... prepare
for something like this?

44
00:01:56,003 --> 00:01:59,204
I'm not even sure
I've held a baby before.

45
00:01:59,206 --> 00:02:00,906
Oh, it's okay,
you'll figure it out.

46
00:02:00,908 --> 00:02:02,841
But how's this all gonna work?

47
00:02:02,843 --> 00:02:03,975
Do we get a nanny?

48
00:02:03,977 --> 00:02:05,210
I mean, can we
afford a nanny?

49
00:02:05,212 --> 00:02:07,012
And if we can,
we can't get a pretty one,

50
00:02:07,014 --> 00:02:08,980
'cause it'll wreck our marriage.

51
00:02:10,384 --> 00:02:13,485
We can't get an ugly one,
'cause it'll scare the kid.

52
00:02:15,355 --> 00:02:17,155
I-I don't know, Howie.

53
00:02:17,157 --> 00:02:18,623
Are we in a good
school district?

54
00:02:18,625 --> 00:02:19,858
You're Catholic, I'm Jewish.

55
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:21,893
What religion do
we raise it?

56
00:02:21,895 --> 00:02:23,395
And if it's a boy,
do we get him circumcised?

57
00:02:23,397 --> 00:02:24,596
People say it's barbaric,

58
00:02:24,598 --> 00:02:27,499
but if we don't, it looks like
a pig in a blanket.

59
00:02:30,637 --> 00:02:33,071
Calm down, it's
gonna be okay.

60
00:02:33,073 --> 00:02:34,639
How's it gonna be okay?

61
00:02:34,641 --> 00:02:38,076
Look at me, I'm a mess.

62
00:02:38,078 --> 00:02:39,744
And that means this baby's
gonna half a mess.

63
00:02:39,746 --> 00:02:41,012
And that's even
before we screw it up

64
00:02:41,014 --> 00:02:43,815
with our cut-rate
moderately attractive nanny.

65
00:02:45,018 --> 00:02:48,653
? Our whole universe
was in a hot, dense state ?

66
00:02:48,655 --> 00:02:51,990
? Then nearly 14 billion years
ago expansion started... Wait! ?

67
00:02:51,992 --> 00:02:53,592
? The Earth began to cool ?

68
00:02:53,594 --> 00:02:56,161
? The autotrophs began to drool,
Neanderthals developed tools ?

69
00:02:56,163 --> 00:02:58,830
? We built the Wall ?
? <i>We built the pyramids</i> ?

70
00:02:58,832 --> 00:03:01,500
? Math, Science, History,
unraveling the mystery ?

71
00:03:01,502 --> 00:03:03,368
? That all started
with a big bang ?

72
00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:05,200
? <i>Bang!</i> ?

75
00:03:14,251 --> 00:03:17,252
Hey, Raj, I read a couple
guys in your department

76
00:03:17,254 --> 00:03:19,354
may have discovered a new
planet in our solar system?

77
00:03:19,356 --> 00:03:21,089
Oh, I heard about that.

78
00:03:21,091 --> 00:03:22,624
Why didn't you
discover it?

79
00:03:22,626 --> 00:03:25,260
Because instead of being
in the telescope room,

80
00:03:25,262 --> 00:03:29,865
I was busy making you guys
homemade jam for the holidays.

81
00:03:29,867 --> 00:03:31,199
Well, you be sure
to let us know

82
00:03:31,201 --> 00:03:34,736
when you win the Nobel
Prize for boysenberry.

83
00:03:37,675 --> 00:03:39,207
Hey.

84
00:03:39,209 --> 00:03:40,275
Hello.
Hey, bud.

85
00:03:40,277 --> 00:03:41,777
Ready to play when you are.

86
00:03:41,779 --> 00:03:42,911
Yeah, um, in a minute.

87
00:03:42,913 --> 00:03:45,147
I actually need
to tell you guys something.

88
00:03:45,149 --> 00:03:46,648
If it's "thank you"
for the homemade jam

89
00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:48,483
you got in December,
congratulations,

90
00:03:48,485 --> 00:03:50,852
you're the
first one.

91
00:03:50,854 --> 00:03:53,188
What's going on?

92
00:03:54,792 --> 00:03:57,159
I'm, uh...

93
00:03:57,161 --> 00:03:59,127
uh, gonna be a father.

94
00:03:59,129 --> 00:04:01,163
That's so amazing.
What? Congratulations.

95
00:04:01,165 --> 00:04:03,498
Oh, no.

96
00:04:04,435 --> 00:04:06,134
Why "oh, no"?

97
00:04:06,136 --> 00:04:08,103
Because this changes everything.

98
00:04:08,105 --> 00:04:09,471
What about comic book night?

99
00:04:09,473 --> 00:04:11,473
Uh, what about playing
games together?

100
00:04:11,475 --> 00:04:13,141
What about our trips
to Disneyland?

101
00:04:13,143 --> 00:04:16,278
How can we do those things
with a child around?

102
00:04:17,448 --> 00:04:20,282
Relax, there's room
for two babies in this group.

103
00:04:20,284 --> 00:04:21,650
Oh, dear L...

104
00:04:21,652 --> 00:04:23,552
Penny's pregnant, too?

105
00:04:23,554 --> 00:04:25,721
You're the other baby.

106
00:04:25,723 --> 00:04:27,155
Oh, really?

107
00:04:27,157 --> 00:04:30,425
Okay, well, would a baby have
to shave once every 11 days?

108
00:04:32,463 --> 00:04:35,030
Would an adult refuse
to eat his graham crackers

109
00:04:35,032 --> 00:04:37,132
because one of them was broken?

110
00:04:37,134 --> 00:04:39,000
I guess we'll call this a draw.

111
00:04:41,772 --> 00:04:43,538
So, I'm glad
you guys are here.

112
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:45,140
There's something I want
to share with you.

113
00:04:45,142 --> 00:04:47,576
Howie and I are going to...

114
00:04:47,578 --> 00:04:49,211
Leonard says you're pregnant.

115
00:04:49,213 --> 00:04:50,479
What?

116
00:04:50,481 --> 00:04:51,380
"Don't say anything.

117
00:04:51,382 --> 00:04:53,281
Act surprised
when she tells you."

118
00:04:53,283 --> 00:04:55,183
All right,
how you want to do this?

119
00:04:56,620 --> 00:04:58,186
I'm pregnant.

120
00:04:58,188 --> 00:04:59,588
Oh, my God, I
can't believe it!

121
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:00,856
This is so exciting!

122
00:05:00,858 --> 00:05:03,525
Yeah, it's all real exciting.

123
00:05:03,527 --> 00:05:06,595
Are-are you not
happy about this?

124
00:05:06,597 --> 00:05:09,831
I am. Of-of course I am. I'm...

125
00:05:09,833 --> 00:05:11,366
I'm sure it's just the hormones.

126
00:05:12,603 --> 00:05:14,503
But it's weird-- Howie's the one
who's been talking about

127
00:05:14,505 --> 00:05:15,937
having kids for years, and I was

128
00:05:15,939 --> 00:05:18,373
all excited to tell him because
I thought he'd be thrilled,

129
00:05:18,375 --> 00:05:20,142
but then he started to flip out

130
00:05:20,144 --> 00:05:22,010
and now this
feels like a bad idea

131
00:05:22,012 --> 00:05:25,013
and I'm gonna get fat.

132
00:05:25,015 --> 00:05:26,748
No, no, come on. Come on,
you're not gonna get fat.

133
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:28,417
You're gonna be beautiful
and glowing

134
00:05:28,419 --> 00:05:30,819
and-and have the cutest
little baby bump ever.

135
00:05:30,821 --> 00:05:33,088
Easy for you to say,
skinny bitch.

136
00:05:34,925 --> 00:05:36,892
Sorry, hormones.

137
00:05:36,894 --> 00:05:38,960
Oh, that's all right.
All I heard was "skinny."

138
00:05:39,863 --> 00:05:42,264
I wouldn't make too much
out of Howard

139
00:05:42,266 --> 00:05:43,995
not reacting the way
you expected him to.

140
00:05:44,019 --> 00:05:45,034
Yeah, I'm sure

141
00:05:45,035 --> 00:05:46,635
it was just
the initial shock of it all.

142
00:05:46,637 --> 00:05:48,804
You're probably right.

143
00:05:48,806 --> 00:05:51,473
After we talked about it,
he started to calm down.

144
00:05:51,475 --> 00:05:53,208
I shouldn't be raising a kid.

145
00:05:53,210 --> 00:05:55,410
I don't even
eat my own vegetables.

146
00:05:56,613 --> 00:05:58,847
Buddy, I-I think
you might be overreacting.

147
00:05:58,849 --> 00:06:00,749
And then there's
this nose.

148
00:06:00,751 --> 00:06:03,819
I mean, what if he
looks like me?

149
00:06:05,088 --> 00:06:06,288
Or worse...

150
00:06:06,290 --> 00:06:08,790
what if <i>she</i> looks like me?

151
00:06:08,792 --> 00:06:10,292
Not to mention

152
00:06:10,294 --> 00:06:12,294
the impact on our social circle.

153
00:06:12,296 --> 00:06:13,562
Everything's going to change.

154
00:06:13,564 --> 00:06:15,397
Howard won't be able
to come over as much.

155
00:06:15,399 --> 00:06:17,599
Well, he could bring the baby here.
Oh, but then we'd have to

156
00:06:17,601 --> 00:06:20,368
baby-proof the apartment.
You know, my sister

157
00:06:20,370 --> 00:06:22,337
has one of those toilet locks
in her bathroom.

158
00:06:22,339 --> 00:06:25,207
I have two doctorates,
I still had to go in the sink.

159
00:06:27,144 --> 00:06:29,110
Oh, my God,
and do you have any idea

160
00:06:29,112 --> 00:06:32,247
how expensive having a kid is?

161
00:06:32,249 --> 00:06:34,683
I read that in Los Angeles,
raising a child through college

162
00:06:34,685 --> 00:06:36,651
can cost over a million dollars.

163
00:06:36,653 --> 00:06:38,720
A million dollars?

164
00:06:38,722 --> 00:06:42,424
God, it's like my nuts
just kicked me in the nuts.

165
00:06:43,694 --> 00:06:44,860
That's it-- I got to start

166
00:06:44,862 --> 00:06:46,962
earning more money right now.

167
00:06:46,964 --> 00:06:48,630
I know--
you could ask Bernadette

168
00:06:48,632 --> 00:06:51,032
for a raise in your allowance.

169
00:06:51,034 --> 00:06:52,801
This isn't a joke.

170
00:06:52,803 --> 00:06:54,636
I wasn't joking.

171
00:06:56,740 --> 00:06:57,939
It'll be fine.

172
00:06:57,941 --> 00:06:59,407
People have kids every day.

173
00:06:59,409 --> 00:07:00,775
You'll figure this out.
Yeah, come on,

174
00:07:00,777 --> 00:07:02,811
this is great news
and you know it.

175
00:07:02,813 --> 00:07:04,713
Oh... You're right, it is,

176
00:07:04,715 --> 00:07:08,350
I'm just...
a little overwhelmed right now.

177
00:07:08,352 --> 00:07:10,619
Hey, you know what we should do?

178
00:07:10,621 --> 00:07:13,488
All get vasectomies so this
doesn't happen to us?

179
00:07:15,993 --> 00:07:18,360
Go out and celebrate.

180
00:07:19,296 --> 00:07:21,463
But not your worst idea.

181
00:07:23,634 --> 00:07:26,768
Hey, let's go do something
to get your mind off this.

182
00:07:26,770 --> 00:07:29,037
Yeah, yeah, we should go out.
Where?

183
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:30,338
Uh, I don't know, a bar?

184
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:31,873
Can't drink.

185
00:07:31,875 --> 00:07:34,576
We can, but all right.

186
00:07:34,578 --> 00:07:36,912
Are you hungry? How about
that sushi place you love?

187
00:07:36,914 --> 00:07:39,915
Doctor said I can't have sushi.

188
00:07:39,917 --> 00:07:41,416
Okay, look, we don't
have to go anywhere.

189
00:07:41,418 --> 00:07:44,019
We can just, you know, stay here
and hang out in the hot tub.

190
00:07:44,021 --> 00:07:46,354
Doctor said I can't
go in the hot tub.

191
00:07:47,858 --> 00:07:49,658
Maybe you should
get a new doctor.

192
00:07:51,695 --> 00:07:55,263
What, he said
you can't laugh either?

193
00:07:56,466 --> 00:07:59,734
I'd like to propose a toast
to our friend, Howard--

194
00:07:59,736 --> 00:08:02,604
his, um, his big heart,
his beautiful soul...

195
00:08:02,606 --> 00:08:03,772
And his tight little pants

196
00:08:03,774 --> 00:08:06,074
that somehow
did not make him sterile.

197
00:08:06,076 --> 00:08:08,310
Cheers.

198
00:08:10,247 --> 00:08:12,113
Well, look at this.

199
00:08:12,115 --> 00:08:13,982
I bet whoever invented
tiny umbrellas

200
00:08:13,984 --> 00:08:15,817
doesn't have to worry
about money.

201
00:08:15,819 --> 00:08:18,219
He can have
all the kids he wants.

202
00:08:18,221 --> 00:08:21,556
And can keep a small portion
of their heads dry.

203
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:26,261
If I'm gonna have any chance
of raising this kid,

204
00:08:26,263 --> 00:08:29,431
I need to come up with
a big idea to make some money.

205
00:08:29,433 --> 00:08:31,266
There's no reason you can't.
That's easy for you to say.

206
00:08:31,268 --> 00:08:32,901
You and Sheldon
already came up with

207
00:08:32,903 --> 00:08:34,569
your superfluid helium model.

208
00:08:34,571 --> 00:08:35,971
That's just research.
We're never gonna

209
00:08:35,973 --> 00:08:37,472
make any money from it.

210
00:08:37,474 --> 00:08:39,174
Forget helium.
The real superfluid

211
00:08:39,176 --> 00:08:41,943
is the fruit punch in this mug.

212
00:08:41,945 --> 00:08:44,346
Reminds me of my daddy's secret

213
00:08:44,348 --> 00:08:46,581
"Don't Tell Mama" juice.

214
00:08:48,652 --> 00:08:50,885
Uh, these are strong,
you should slow down.

215
00:08:50,887 --> 00:08:53,321
Oh. I'll just take one last sip.

216
00:08:59,432 --> 00:09:00,432
Ah.

217
00:09:10,738 --> 00:09:13,739
Okay, how about this
for an invention--

218
00:09:13,741 --> 00:09:17,009
slightly... bigger
cocktail umbrellas.

219
00:09:18,312 --> 00:09:19,878
How is that a new invention?

220
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:22,281
I don't know, all Apple does
is change the size of things

221
00:09:22,283 --> 00:09:24,483
and we keep buying them.

222
00:09:24,485 --> 00:09:28,287
It's true. I like my giant iPad
and my little iPad

223
00:09:28,289 --> 00:09:31,757
almost as much
as my regular-sized iPad.

224
00:09:31,759 --> 00:09:33,992
This place is terrific.

225
00:09:33,994 --> 00:09:36,595
Why-why have
we never been here before?

226
00:09:36,597 --> 00:09:40,933
The same reason we don't do
a lot of fun stuff-- you.

227
00:09:40,935 --> 00:09:43,035
That's some smart talk
from a guy

228
00:09:43,037 --> 00:09:45,504
who can't even keep
his face in focus.

229
00:09:48,108 --> 00:09:50,342
Where's the bathroom?

230
00:09:50,344 --> 00:09:51,510
Uh, it's in the corner.

231
00:09:51,512 --> 00:09:53,712
Excuse me.

232
00:09:55,149 --> 00:09:57,950
Hey, how you doin'?

233
00:09:59,987 --> 00:10:01,887
I hope the bathroom
is clearly marked.

234
00:10:01,889 --> 00:10:03,021
Doesn't matter.

235
00:10:03,023 --> 00:10:05,324
He's headed
for the kitchen anyway.

236
00:10:06,226 --> 00:10:07,359
Maybe that's an idea--

237
00:10:07,361 --> 00:10:09,928
guidance systems
for drunk people.

238
00:10:09,930 --> 00:10:12,230
They have that.
It's called Uber.

239
00:10:12,232 --> 00:10:13,599
Hey.

240
00:10:13,601 --> 00:10:15,334
In your supercooled
helium experiments,

241
00:10:15,336 --> 00:10:17,803
did you create
quantum vortices?

242
00:10:17,805 --> 00:10:18,804
Yeah. Why?

243
00:10:18,806 --> 00:10:20,105
Well, if you made
a guidance system,

244
00:10:20,107 --> 00:10:22,541
couldn't you use those vortices
as a gyroscope?

245
00:10:22,543 --> 00:10:25,010
Wow. I've never thought
about that.

246
00:10:25,012 --> 00:10:26,612
And since
it's in a quantum state,

247
00:10:26,614 --> 00:10:28,413
it would maintain
an infinite persistence.

248
00:10:28,415 --> 00:10:31,049
Groundbreaking revelations,
tropical drinks.

249
00:10:31,051 --> 00:10:35,087
Tell me this isn't like the best
episode of <i>Sex and the City.</i>

250
00:10:37,124 --> 00:10:39,858
You may have actually
just come up with something.

251
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:41,560
You think so?
I really do.

252
00:10:41,562 --> 00:10:44,563
You guys, the bathroom
here is amazing.

253
00:10:44,565 --> 00:10:47,199
There's people
cooking in it.

254
00:10:49,937 --> 00:10:51,436
Think about all the fun
things you get to do

255
00:10:51,438 --> 00:10:52,804
when you have a baby.
Yeah!

256
00:10:52,806 --> 00:10:56,041
Yeah, you get to buy toys
and little clothes.

257
00:10:56,043 --> 00:10:59,044
I kind of already do that
for Howie.

258
00:10:59,046 --> 00:11:00,946
And-and whenever you're hungry,

259
00:11:00,948 --> 00:11:05,050
you'll be in a minivan with
Cheerios all over the floor.

260
00:11:05,052 --> 00:11:07,919
Oh, and I just found a
new travel cup for Sheldon.

261
00:11:07,921 --> 00:11:10,055
It only lets out
three at a time.

262
00:11:11,158 --> 00:11:13,859
So, when did you guys
decide to get pregnant?

263
00:11:13,861 --> 00:11:16,628
Well, we didn't exactly decide.

264
00:11:16,630 --> 00:11:17,896
We were talking about it,

265
00:11:17,898 --> 00:11:20,132
and then one night
we got a little reckless.

266
00:11:20,134 --> 00:11:22,134
Oh, tell us!
Yeah, tell us.

267
00:11:22,136 --> 00:11:23,368
No, I'm embarrassed.
Oh, come on,

268
00:11:23,370 --> 00:11:25,137
we're all grown-ups.
We've all done it.

269
00:11:25,139 --> 00:11:28,173
Me! Me-me, too!
I'm a grown-up and I've done it!

270
00:11:30,577 --> 00:11:32,577
Fine.

271
00:11:32,579 --> 00:11:34,112
We were out one night,

272
00:11:34,114 --> 00:11:37,683
and things got
a little spontaneous.

273
00:11:37,685 --> 00:11:39,618
Oh, that sounds juicy.

274
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:41,553
Well, Sheldon was going on
and on about time zones

275
00:11:41,555 --> 00:11:44,409
and railroad schedules,
and I went out...

276
00:11:44,410 --> 00:11:46,793
Wait, I remember that.
Hang on.

277
00:11:46,794 --> 00:11:50,429
You did it
at our place?

278
00:11:50,431 --> 00:11:53,632
Kind of on Sheldon's bed.

279
00:11:53,634 --> 00:11:56,234
What?!
No!

280
00:11:57,071 --> 00:11:59,037
I was headed to the bathroom,

281
00:11:59,039 --> 00:12:01,373
and I passed Howie
on his way out.

282
00:12:01,375 --> 00:12:05,243
Usually he says,
"Do not go in there,"

283
00:12:05,245 --> 00:12:10,182
but this time he said,
"Hey, let's go in here."

284
00:12:10,184 --> 00:12:11,717
How could you do that?
I'm sorry,

285
00:12:11,719 --> 00:12:13,952
but you know what it's like
when you're with your man

286
00:12:13,954 --> 00:12:15,620
and one thing leads to another.

287
00:12:15,622 --> 00:12:18,190
I do know what that's like.
I really do.

288
00:12:20,828 --> 00:12:22,394
I'm not seeing anyone

289
00:12:22,396 --> 00:12:24,496
using liquid helium
vortices like this.

290
00:12:24,498 --> 00:12:26,364
I'm not finding
anything either.

291
00:12:26,366 --> 00:12:27,599
That's a good sign.

292
00:12:27,601 --> 00:12:29,534
Oh, wait, I found something.

293
00:12:29,536 --> 00:12:30,902
Damn. What is it?

294
00:12:30,904 --> 00:12:33,772
This video.
The baby panda sneezes,

295
00:12:33,774 --> 00:12:36,742
and the mama panda
gets so scared.

296
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:41,980
Can you focus
on what we're talking about?

297
00:12:41,982 --> 00:12:43,415
All right.

298
00:12:43,417 --> 00:12:45,951
Look, now,
this may be the rum talking,

299
00:12:45,953 --> 00:12:48,887
but as long as the unpinning
rate of the vortices

300
00:12:48,889 --> 00:12:51,356
is kept within 1.1 and 1.3,

301
00:12:51,358 --> 00:12:54,726
the Magnus force issue
should be negligible.

302
00:12:56,196 --> 00:12:59,965
Even drunk, he's still smarter
than all of us.

303
00:12:59,967 --> 00:13:01,900
And stronger.

304
00:13:01,902 --> 00:13:05,370
Yeah. Who wants to see me
beat up the bartender?

305
00:13:06,206 --> 00:13:08,006
I'd enjoy that.

306
00:13:08,008 --> 00:13:10,475
Nah, she's a good kid.

307
00:13:12,346 --> 00:13:15,013
If this is a viable thing,
we could get a patent

308
00:13:15,015 --> 00:13:18,083
and license it to companies
that make guidance systems.

309
00:13:18,085 --> 00:13:20,552
Look at that. You've known
you're gonna be a father

310
00:13:20,554 --> 00:13:23,221
for less than a day
and you're already stepping up.

311
00:13:23,223 --> 00:13:24,456
I'm telling you,
you got this.

312
00:13:24,458 --> 00:13:25,724
Maybe you're right.

313
00:13:25,726 --> 00:13:27,192
Of course he's right.

314
00:13:27,194 --> 00:13:30,962
You and I both know how hard it
is growing up without a father.

315
00:13:30,964 --> 00:13:32,864
That's why I'm confident
you're gonna be

316
00:13:32,866 --> 00:13:34,599
the best dad you can be.

317
00:13:35,435 --> 00:13:37,502
Thank you, Sheldon.

318
00:13:37,504 --> 00:13:38,804
You're welcome.

319
00:13:38,806 --> 00:13:40,405
And if he has
twins, we can do

320
00:13:40,407 --> 00:13:43,875
all kinds
of neat experiments on them.

321
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:49,214
You guys can go in
if you want.

322
00:13:49,216 --> 00:13:50,515
No, we're a team.

323
00:13:50,517 --> 00:13:52,484
If you can't go in,
we're not going in.

324
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:55,620
Then why are we drinking?

325
00:13:55,622 --> 00:13:58,356
Okay, it's not like she's got
the Christ child in there,

326
00:13:58,358 --> 00:14:00,292
all right?

327
00:14:01,728 --> 00:14:03,261
Oh. It's Leonard.

328
00:14:03,263 --> 00:14:05,564
He says Sheldon's drunk
and they're gonna do karaoke

329
00:14:05,566 --> 00:14:06,698
if we want to join them.

330
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:08,633
That sounds fun.

331
00:14:08,635 --> 00:14:10,535
Oh, no.

332
00:14:10,537 --> 00:14:12,470
Sheldon's drunk
texting me.

333
00:14:12,472 --> 00:14:13,505
What's it say?

334
00:14:13,507 --> 00:14:16,241
"Would you like
to sing karaoke with us."

335
00:14:16,243 --> 00:14:17,676
How is that a drunk text?

336
00:14:17,678 --> 00:14:19,578
He used a period
instead of a question mark.

337
00:14:19,580 --> 00:14:22,047
He's so wasted.

338
00:14:24,351 --> 00:14:26,518
? Your movie's showing,
so you're going ?

339
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:28,386
? Could care less about the five
you're blowing ?

340
00:14:28,388 --> 00:14:30,455
? Theater gets dark
just to start the show ?

341
00:14:30,457 --> 00:14:31,857
? You spot a fine woman
sitting ?

342
00:14:31,859 --> 00:14:33,458
? In your row, she's
dressed in yellow ?

343
00:14:33,460 --> 00:14:34,693
? She says, "Hello" ?

344
00:14:34,695 --> 00:14:36,728
? "Come sit next to me,
you fine fellow" ?

345
00:14:36,730 --> 00:14:38,463
? You run over there
without a second to lose ?

346
00:14:38,465 --> 00:14:39,998
? And what comes next, hey ?

347
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,333
? Bust a move ?

348
00:14:41,335 --> 00:14:43,368
? You want it ?

349
00:14:43,370 --> 00:14:46,171
? You got it,
oh, you want it ?

350
00:14:46,173 --> 00:14:48,139
? Baby, you got it ?

351
00:14:48,141 --> 00:14:49,174
? Just bust a move ?

352
00:14:49,176 --> 00:14:50,976
? You want it ?

353
00:14:50,978 --> 00:14:53,545
? You got it, oh ?

354
00:14:53,547 --> 00:14:56,114
? You want it,
baby, you got it ?

355
00:14:56,116 --> 00:14:58,283
? Just bust a move ?

356
00:14:58,285 --> 00:15:00,619
? You want it, you got it ?

357
00:15:00,621 --> 00:15:02,487
? Oh, you
want it ?

358
00:15:02,489 --> 00:15:05,323
Hey, guys. Congratulations!

359
00:15:05,325 --> 00:15:06,291
Thank you.

360
00:15:06,293 --> 00:15:08,960
Hi. How are you doing?

361
00:15:08,962 --> 00:15:10,562
Oh, wonderful.

362
00:15:10,564 --> 00:15:13,932
I'm being musically
encouraged to bust a move.

363
00:15:13,934 --> 00:15:17,602
If I knew what that meant,
I might just do it.

364
00:15:17,604 --> 00:15:19,271
I'm really glad
you're here.

365
00:15:19,273 --> 00:15:21,373
Can we talk?
Sure.

366
00:15:22,576 --> 00:15:24,609
So, you gonna get
up there later?

367
00:15:24,611 --> 00:15:26,444
A microphone,
a room

368
00:15:26,446 --> 00:15:28,747
full of inaccurate depictions
of Polynesian religion,

369
00:15:28,749 --> 00:15:33,084
and a captive audience
to hear about it? You bet I am.

370
00:15:34,521 --> 00:15:37,222
I'm sorry I freaked out
this morning.

371
00:15:37,224 --> 00:15:38,657
I want you to know...

372
00:15:38,659 --> 00:15:40,825
I'm done being scared.

373
00:15:40,827 --> 00:15:43,628
It's okay to be nervous.
I am, too.

374
00:15:43,630 --> 00:15:45,330
Thank God, 'cause I was lying--
you might not have to wait

375
00:15:45,332 --> 00:15:48,500
nine months to see
someone soil their pants.

376
00:15:48,502 --> 00:15:52,504
But I'm also
really excited.

377
00:15:53,307 --> 00:15:54,706
I mean it.

378
00:15:54,708 --> 00:15:56,007
Me, too.

379
00:15:56,009 --> 00:15:57,609
I love you.

380
00:15:58,645 --> 00:16:00,345
Mmm.
And I'm not just saying that

381
00:16:00,347 --> 00:16:02,580
because your breasts
are gonna get bigger.

382
00:16:06,086 --> 00:16:09,521
? Are we an item?
Girl, quit playin' ?

383
00:16:09,523 --> 00:16:10,956
? We're just friends ?

384
00:16:10,958 --> 00:16:14,025
? What are you sayin'? ?

385
00:16:14,027 --> 00:16:17,295
? Say there's another
and look right in my eyes ?

386
00:16:17,297 --> 00:16:20,298
? My first love broke my heart
for the first time ?

387
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:21,766
? And I was like ?

388
00:16:21,768 --> 00:16:24,569
? Baby, baby, baby, ooh ?

389
00:16:24,571 --> 00:16:28,506
? Like, baby, baby, baby, no ?

390
00:16:28,508 --> 00:16:31,843
? Like, baby, baby, baby, ooh ?

391
00:16:31,845 --> 00:16:36,348
? I thought
you'd always be mine ?

392
00:16:36,350 --> 00:16:41,319
? Baby, I need your lovin',
<i>got</i> ?

393
00:16:41,321 --> 00:16:44,422
? To have all
your lovin' ?

394
00:16:44,424 --> 00:16:48,793
? Baby, I need your lovin' ?

395
00:16:48,795 --> 00:16:52,230
? <i>Got</i> to have
all your lovin' ?

396
00:16:52,232 --> 00:16:54,699
? ?

397
00:16:54,701 --> 00:16:56,501
? Ooh, baby, baby ?

398
00:16:56,503 --> 00:16:58,269
? Baby, baby ?

399
00:16:58,271 --> 00:16:59,604
? Ooh, baby, baby ?

400
00:16:59,606 --> 00:17:02,107
? Baby,
baby ?

401
00:17:02,109 --> 00:17:03,241
? Ah, push it ?

402
00:17:03,243 --> 00:17:04,542
I appreciate this,
but you really...

403
00:17:04,544 --> 00:17:07,579
? Push it real good ?

404
00:17:07,581 --> 00:17:12,317
? Land where my fathers died ?

405
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:16,855
? Land of the pilgrims' pride ?

406
00:17:16,857 --> 00:17:22,027
? From ev'ry mountainside ?

407
00:17:22,029 --> 00:17:26,264
? Let freedom ?

408
00:17:26,266 --> 00:17:31,403
? Ring... ?

409
00:17:32,572 --> 00:17:34,139
I'd like to dedicate

410
00:17:34,141 --> 00:17:37,842
my last song of the evening
to my wife,

411
00:17:37,844 --> 00:17:39,778
best friend,
and...

412
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:42,213
now the mother of our child.

413
00:17:43,216 --> 00:17:44,816
I love you, Bernie.

414
00:17:44,818 --> 00:17:46,885
? ?

415
00:17:46,887 --> 00:17:50,555
? Havin' my baby ?

416
00:17:50,557 --> 00:17:53,024
? What a lovely way
of sayin' ?

417
00:17:53,026 --> 00:17:56,561
? How much you love me ?

418
00:17:56,563 --> 00:17:59,864
? Havin' my baby ?

419
00:17:59,866 --> 00:18:01,900
? What a lovely way ?

420
00:18:01,902 --> 00:18:05,136
? Of sayin'
what you're thinkin' of me ?

421
00:18:05,138 --> 00:18:06,638
You're kidding!

422
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:10,809
What kind of maniacs have coitus
in someone else's bedroom?!

423
00:18:10,811 --> 00:18:13,611
? ?

424
00:18:13,613 --> 00:18:16,214
Thank you, Pasadena!
Good night!

425
00:18:25,730 --> 00:18:27,597
That was such
a fun night.

426
00:18:27,599 --> 00:18:29,299
Probably 'cause you got
to see your man

427
00:18:29,301 --> 00:18:32,402
up there rockin' the mic.

428
00:18:32,404 --> 00:18:34,037
Yeah, yeah.
I was a little surprised

429
00:18:34,039 --> 00:18:36,005
when you decided to beat-box.

430
00:18:36,007 --> 00:18:38,875
Oh. That was really
an asthma attack.

431
00:18:38,877 --> 00:18:41,344
I just sold it.

432
00:18:42,347 --> 00:18:44,314
Well, I am so happy for
Howard and Bernadette.

433
00:18:44,316 --> 00:18:45,848
Me, too.

434
00:18:46,718 --> 00:18:49,085
So, you ever think about it?

435
00:18:49,087 --> 00:18:50,453
Babies?
Mm-hmm.

436
00:18:50,455 --> 00:18:53,256
Well, I'm not in a rush
but someday, yeah, sure.

437
00:18:53,258 --> 00:18:54,791
What about you?

438
00:18:55,660 --> 00:18:58,961
I think we'd make
amazing parents.

439
00:18:58,963 --> 00:19:01,030
Will you guys keep it down?

440
00:19:05,603 --> 00:19:08,671
On the other hand, we might lack
a certain maturity.
