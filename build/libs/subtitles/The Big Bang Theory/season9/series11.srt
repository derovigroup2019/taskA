Guys, tickets already went on sale!
What?!

5
00:01:00,765 --> 00:01:02,565
They're not supposed
to be available yet.

00:01:02,567 --> 00:01:04,233
I don't know what to tell
you, but they're on sale!

00:01:04,235 --> 00:01:06,702
What? Wait. You're sure
they're<i> Star Wars</i> tickets?

WOLOWITZ: Same here!

11
00:01:14,846 --> 00:01:17,112
Guys, they're gonna sell out!
What are we gonna do?!

12
00:01:17,114 --> 00:01:19,348
All right, this goes
against everything I stand for,

13
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:21,684
but desperate times call
for desperate measures.

14
00:01:21,686 --> 00:01:23,385
Lord...

15
00:01:25,189 --> 00:01:27,189
This is Sheldon Cooper.

16
00:01:27,191 --> 00:01:29,859
You're good friends with my mom.

17
00:01:29,861 --> 00:01:33,495
I know I've spent my life
denying that you exist.

18
00:01:33,497 --> 00:01:35,898
Got 'em!
And I will continue to do so!

19
00:01:37,301 --> 00:01:40,903
? Our whole universe
was in a hot, dense state ?

20
00:01:40,905 --> 00:01:44,240
? Then nearly 14 billion years
ago expansion started... Wait! ?

21
00:01:44,242 --> 00:01:45,875
? The Earth began to cool ?

22
00:01:45,877 --> 00:01:48,410
? The autotrophs began to drool,
Neanderthals developed tools ?

23
00:01:48,412 --> 00:01:51,080
? We built the Wall ?
?<i> We built the pyramids</i> ?

24
00:01:51,082 --> 00:01:53,749
? Math, Science, History,

Oh, thank you.

31
00:02:10,188 --> 00:02:12,555
I'm also really happy, but
I can't pretend it's for you.

32
00:02:12,557 --> 00:02:14,657
New<i> Star Wars</i> in three days!

33
00:02:15,627 --> 00:02:17,627
Hey, Thursday can't
get here soon enough.

34
00:02:17,629 --> 00:02:20,130
I'm taking off work
to watch the original trilogy

35
00:02:20,132 --> 00:02:24,601
while I eat enough<i> Star Wars</i>
cereal to choke a Wookiee.

36
00:02:24,603 --> 00:02:28,104
Uh, sweetie, you do realize
Thursday is Amy's birthday.

37
00:02:28,106 --> 00:02:30,673
And you do realize
I bought my ticket

38
00:02:30,675 --> 00:02:32,475
when Amy and I were broken up?

39
00:02:33,945 --> 00:02:36,112
I hope you didn't need anything
in that case,

40
00:02:36,114 --> 00:02:37,547
'cause it's closed.

41
00:02:37,549 --> 00:02:39,916
You guys just got back together.

42
00:02:39,918 --> 00:02:42,085
You might not want
to ditch her on her birthday.

43
00:02:42,087 --> 00:02:44,354
I think Penny has a point.
You can see it another day.

44
00:02:44,356 --> 00:02:46,356
But someone might
spoil the movie.

45
00:02:46,358 --> 00:02:48,424
No one can spoil
Amy's birthday for me.

46
00:02:48,426 --> 00:02:49,726
Surprise! She's even older.

47
00:02:49,728 --> 00:02:52,028
Who saw that coming?

48
00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:53,830
Oh, that's nice.

49
00:02:53,832 --> 00:02:56,299
Put that on her cake.

50
00:02:58,570 --> 00:03:01,237
(whirring)

51
00:03:05,977 --> 00:03:08,912
Oh, great. This again.

52
00:03:08,914 --> 00:03:12,649
Arthur, what brings you back?

53
00:03:12,651 --> 00:03:14,884
Uh, beats me. I-I just...

54
00:03:14,886 --> 00:03:17,487
hope this isn't a-a sex dream.

55
00:03:19,324 --> 00:03:21,257
In the past, you've come to me

56
00:03:21,259 --> 00:03:23,092
when I'm struggling
with a dilemma.

57
00:03:23,094 --> 00:03:26,262
And-and the one time where...
where you were afraid,

58
00:03:26,264 --> 00:03:30,567
and you needed me for...
for a night light.

59
00:03:32,204 --> 00:03:34,070
What's-what's troubling you?

60
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:36,639
Well...

61
00:03:36,641 --> 00:03:38,608
my friends are telling me

62
00:03:38,610 --> 00:03:41,044
I shouldn't abandon
my girlfriend on her birthday

63
00:03:41,046 --> 00:03:43,846
to see the new<i> Star Wars</i> movie.

64
00:03:43,848 --> 00:03:46,249
Well, sounds right.

65
00:03:47,619 --> 00:03:50,086
Can... can I get out of this...

66
00:03:50,088 --> 00:03:52,989
muumuu now?

67
00:03:52,991 --> 00:03:55,058
Those are the robes of the Jedi,

68
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:57,994
the guardians of peace
and justice in the galaxy.

69
00:03:57,996 --> 00:04:02,198
And they... they-they don't wear
underwear.

70
00:04:07,138 --> 00:04:09,372
So, you agree with my friends

71
00:04:09,374 --> 00:04:11,574
that I should skip the premiere?

72
00:04:11,576 --> 00:04:15,211
Uh, do... do you
love this girl?

73
00:04:15,213 --> 00:04:17,146
Yes.

74
00:04:17,148 --> 00:04:20,416
But she knows how important
<i>Star Wars</i> is to me.

75
00:04:20,418 --> 00:04:22,719
Well, maybe
you should show her how...

76
00:04:22,721 --> 00:04:25,555
how important<i> she</i> is to you.

77
00:04:25,557 --> 00:04:29,325
By seeing the movie
she'd want me to see?

78
00:04:30,495 --> 00:04:33,730
Sheldon, you-you can see
this movie whenever you want.

79
00:04:34,633 --> 00:04:37,934
But you only have
a limited number of days

80
00:04:37,936 --> 00:04:41,070
that you-you can be
with this woman.

81
00:04:41,072 --> 00:04:42,905
Be with her.

82
00:04:44,743 --> 00:04:46,676
You're right.

83
00:04:46,678 --> 00:04:48,344
Great.

84
00:04:49,214 --> 00:04:51,180
Where are you going?

85
00:04:51,182 --> 00:04:56,085
I don't know, but hopefully,
somewhere I can wear pants.

86
00:04:58,690 --> 00:05:00,890
(cell phone ringtone playing)

87
00:05:05,330 --> 00:05:07,330
Sheldon, what's wrong?

88
00:05:07,332 --> 00:05:10,867
I wanted to let you know I'll be
spending your birthday with you.

89
00:05:11,736 --> 00:05:13,870
Okay.

90
00:05:13,872 --> 00:05:17,173
See, I-I had tickets to the
<i>Star Wars</i> premiere that night,

91
00:05:17,175 --> 00:05:19,609
but Professor Proton came to me
in a dream dressed as

92
00:05:19,611 --> 00:05:22,712
Obi-Wan Kenobi and convinced me
I should be with you.

93
00:05:23,548 --> 00:05:25,448
Obi-what?

94
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:28,384
I'll-I'll let you get back
to sleep now. Good night.

95
00:05:28,386 --> 00:05:29,852
Okay. Good night. Wait.

96
00:05:29,854 --> 00:05:31,287
Um, Sheldon,

97
00:05:31,289 --> 00:05:34,223
were you actually<i> not</i> gonna
spend my birthday with me?

98
00:05:36,061 --> 00:05:38,828
It's late. Got to go. Bye.

99
00:05:39,998 --> 00:05:41,297
Good for Sheldon deciding

100
00:05:41,299 --> 00:05:43,599
to stay with Amy on her birthday.
I know.

101
00:05:43,601 --> 00:05:45,568
It's still gonna be weird
to see the movie without him.

102
00:05:45,570 --> 00:05:49,539
Well, we could wait a
couple days and see it together.

103
00:05:50,608 --> 00:05:52,508
(loud laughter)

104
00:05:52,510 --> 00:05:54,844
Hello.

105
00:05:54,846 --> 00:05:56,746
Hey. We're going to the comic
book store. You want to come?

106
00:05:56,748 --> 00:05:58,181
No, I can't.

107
00:05:58,183 --> 00:06:00,316
I need to make preparations
for Amy's birthday.

108
00:06:00,318 --> 00:06:01,451
Which leads me

109
00:06:01,453 --> 00:06:03,586
to the following bit
of business.

110
00:06:03,588 --> 00:06:05,822
This is my ticket to<i> Star Wars.</i>

111
00:06:05,824 --> 00:06:08,358
I don't have to tell you
it is worth far more

112
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:11,994
than its face value
of $15.50.

113
00:06:11,996 --> 00:06:14,731
I trust you'll give it
to someone worthy.

114
00:06:14,733 --> 00:06:16,032
You got it.

115
00:06:16,034 --> 00:06:17,633
Well, Penny might
want to join us.

116
00:06:17,635 --> 00:06:21,070
This is my ticket
to<i> Star Wars.</i>

117
00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:23,439
(knocking)
SHELDON: Penny.

118
00:06:23,441 --> 00:06:24,607
Penny?
(knocking)

119
00:06:24,609 --> 00:06:25,742
(knocking)
Penny?

120
00:06:25,744 --> 00:06:28,111
What happens if
I say, “Come in”?

121
00:06:28,113 --> 00:06:29,779
Well, find out.

122
00:06:29,781 --> 00:06:31,114
Come in!

123
00:06:34,419 --> 00:06:36,386
(knocking)
Bernadette?

124
00:06:36,388 --> 00:06:38,388
(knocking) Bernadette?
Bernadette?

125
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:40,656
Come in!

126
00:06:40,658 --> 00:06:42,692
SHELDON:
Keep it up.

127
00:06:42,694 --> 00:06:44,727
I got nowhere else to be.

128
00:06:44,729 --> 00:06:46,696
Just come in.

129
00:06:47,832 --> 00:06:50,433
For future reference,
if I want to watch<i> Mean Girls,</i>

130
00:06:50,435 --> 00:06:52,902
I'll stream it on Netflix.

131
00:06:52,904 --> 00:06:55,037
We're sorry.
What do you need?

132
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:56,406
Well, as you know,

133
00:06:56,408 --> 00:06:58,408
I'll be celebrating
Amy's birthday with her,

134
00:06:58,410 --> 00:06:59,642
and I could use your assistance

135
00:06:59,644 --> 00:07:01,511
in helping me select
the perfect gift.

136
00:07:01,513 --> 00:07:03,045
Sure.
Well, so far,

137
00:07:03,047 --> 00:07:04,480
I've come up with three ideas.

138
00:07:04,482 --> 00:07:06,082
The first is a chance for her

139
00:07:06,084 --> 00:07:07,917
to play the harp
with the L.A. Philharmonic.

140
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:09,652
Wow. You can really
arrange that?

141
00:07:09,654 --> 00:07:11,187
Well, I said a chance,
you know.

142
00:07:11,189 --> 00:07:12,622
When you tell them
it's your birthday

143
00:07:12,624 --> 00:07:14,023
at Bennigan's,
they make a fuss.

144
00:07:14,025 --> 00:07:16,292
I don't see why the Philharmonic
would be any different.

145
00:07:17,195 --> 00:07:19,562
How about something
a little more realistic?

146
00:07:19,564 --> 00:07:22,165
Well, Amy enjoys
knitting her own sweaters,

147
00:07:22,167 --> 00:07:24,967
so I was thinking of getting her
an all-expense-paid trip

148
00:07:24,969 --> 00:07:27,804
to the Wisconsin Sheep
and Wool Festival.

149
00:07:30,542 --> 00:07:33,576
Sorry. I was waiting
for the bazinga.

150
00:07:34,279 --> 00:07:35,778
Hold on. It could be romantic.

151
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:37,213
The two of them away together,

152
00:07:37,215 --> 00:07:40,082
keeping each other warm
in snowy Wisconsin.

153
00:07:40,084 --> 00:07:41,617
No, no, no, no.
She'd be going alone.

154
00:07:41,619 --> 00:07:43,286
Well, if you think
I'm afraid of birds,

155
00:07:43,288 --> 00:07:44,587
you should see me around sheep.

156
00:07:44,589 --> 00:07:46,823
Okay, well,
what's the third option?

157
00:07:46,825 --> 00:07:48,291
That I have coitus with her.

158
00:07:48,293 --> 00:07:49,625
(glass shatters on floor)

159
00:07:56,701 --> 00:07:59,602
What do you think about giving
Sheldon's ticket to Stuart?

160
00:07:59,604 --> 00:08:01,137
I don't know.

161
00:08:01,139 --> 00:08:03,606
Have you ever seen a movie
with Stuart before?

162
00:08:03,608 --> 00:08:06,142
It's like going
with your grandpa.

163
00:08:06,144 --> 00:08:07,543
Instead of eating popcorn,

164
00:08:07,545 --> 00:08:09,779
he brings little pieces
of chicken in Tupperware

165
00:08:09,781 --> 00:08:12,181
and a thermos full of soup.

166
00:08:12,183 --> 00:08:14,217
He's not that bad.

167
00:08:14,219 --> 00:08:17,286
Hey, Stuart, got any plans
Thursday night?

168
00:08:17,288 --> 00:08:19,989
My, uh... my doctor's worried
about my circulation,

169
00:08:19,991 --> 00:08:22,859
so I was thinking about
walking around the mall.

170
00:08:22,861 --> 00:08:24,494
Why?

171
00:08:24,496 --> 00:08:26,662
Well...
Hey, you guys.

172
00:08:26,664 --> 00:08:28,297
Oh, make sure
to wear sensible shoes.

173
00:08:28,299 --> 00:08:30,533
Wil, want to go
to<i> Star Wars</i> Thursday?

174
00:08:30,535 --> 00:08:31,667
Absolutely.

175
00:08:31,669 --> 00:08:33,236
Fine, take Wil.

176
00:08:33,238 --> 00:08:35,505
See if<i> he</i> brings you
clam chowder.

177
00:08:37,675 --> 00:08:39,442
Okay, okay, okay,
okay, okay.

178
00:08:39,444 --> 00:08:41,410
Let's-let's... let's just
recap our options.

179
00:08:41,412 --> 00:08:44,614
All right, we've got
harp thing, sheep thing...

180
00:08:44,616 --> 00:08:46,415
Wild thang.

181
00:08:49,153 --> 00:08:50,987
Which do you think
she'd prefer?

182
00:08:50,989 --> 00:08:54,757
Because I checked the Sheep
and Wool Festival Web site,

183
00:08:54,759 --> 00:08:57,226
and there's only
8,000 tickets left.

184
00:08:59,163 --> 00:09:02,064
Sheldon, being physical with
Amy is a huge step for you.

185
00:09:02,066 --> 00:09:03,866
Yeah, are you ready
for this?

186
00:09:03,868 --> 00:09:07,136
Intimacy in any form
has been challenging for me,

187
00:09:07,138 --> 00:09:09,772
but I'd like to show her
how important she is,

188
00:09:09,774 --> 00:09:12,642
and it feels like
now might be the right time.

189
00:09:12,644 --> 00:09:14,410
Sheldon, that's
so beautiful.

190
00:09:14,412 --> 00:09:16,245
Then it's settled.

191
00:09:16,247 --> 00:09:18,915
Amy's birthday present
will be my genitals.

192
00:09:28,543 --> 00:09:29,942
Thanks for taking me out.

193
00:09:29,944 --> 00:09:32,011
Well, you're spending
your birthday with Sheldon.

194
00:09:32,013 --> 00:09:33,145
Why not celebrate early?

195
00:09:33,147 --> 00:09:34,947
So where do
you want to go?

196
00:09:34,949 --> 00:09:37,483
I heard that new Mexican place
on Green Street is good.

197
00:09:37,485 --> 00:09:41,821
Sure, sure. Or we could
take you to get a bikini wax.

198
00:09:43,424 --> 00:09:46,893
Why would I get a bikini
wax for my birthday?

199
00:09:46,895 --> 00:09:49,662
Uh, I don't know.
It was just a thought.

200
00:09:49,664 --> 00:09:51,731
I think I'll just
stick to Mexican.

201
00:09:51,733 --> 00:09:55,902
Great. And then maybe after,
we can watch a dirty movie,

202
00:09:55,904 --> 00:09:58,738
and if anybody has any questions
about what happened or how,

203
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:01,073
we can answer them.

204
00:10:01,976 --> 00:10:04,277
Okay, what
is going on?

205
00:10:04,279 --> 00:10:06,312
Oh, we just want you
to be prepared

206
00:10:06,314 --> 00:10:08,648
for any surprises
that might happen tomorrow.

207
00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:10,783
What surprises?

208
00:10:10,785 --> 00:10:12,718
Oh.

209
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,987
We don't want to
spoil anything,

210
00:10:14,989 --> 00:10:19,926
but you should know that Sheldon
said he's ready to be physical.

211
00:10:19,928 --> 00:10:22,428
You shut your damn mouth!

212
00:10:26,067 --> 00:10:28,801
You actually heard him say this?

213
00:10:28,803 --> 00:10:30,102
Yes. He said he wants
to do something

214
00:10:30,104 --> 00:10:31,537
to show you how much
you mean to him.

215
00:10:31,539 --> 00:10:36,108
(exhales)
I-I can't believe it. I...

216
00:10:37,512 --> 00:10:39,812
I don't know what to say.

217
00:10:39,814 --> 00:10:41,681
Well, we're really
happy for you,

218
00:10:41,683 --> 00:10:43,382
and we know how
much he cares...

219
00:10:43,384 --> 00:10:45,151
I do know what to say!
Let's get me waxed!

220
00:10:50,758 --> 00:10:52,959
(whirring)

221
00:10:54,595 --> 00:10:58,864
Why isn't it ever
Angie Dickinson's bedroom?

222
00:10:59,934 --> 00:11:01,600
You're back.

223
00:11:01,602 --> 00:11:05,805
It-it doesn't seem
like it's up to me.

224
00:11:05,807 --> 00:11:08,374
I suppose you're here because...

225
00:11:08,376 --> 00:11:11,610
I've decided to be physical
with my girlfriend,

226
00:11:11,612 --> 00:11:14,280
and I've never done that before.

227
00:11:14,282 --> 00:11:18,417
E-Excuse me for a moment.

228
00:11:24,292 --> 00:11:26,492
(lightsaber humming)

229
00:11:34,035 --> 00:11:36,869
Well, it was worth a shot.

230
00:11:38,706 --> 00:11:41,674
So, can you help me?

231
00:11:41,676 --> 00:11:44,210
Uh, all right. Um...

232
00:11:44,212 --> 00:11:47,680
once-once the man gets

233
00:11:47,682 --> 00:11:50,649
the-the woman out of her...
out of her bloomers...

234
00:11:50,651 --> 00:11:53,652
Oh, no.
Not that.

235
00:11:53,654 --> 00:11:56,155
I-I understand
the mechanics.

236
00:11:56,157 --> 00:11:58,457
Oh, good, good. 'Cause, uh,

237
00:11:58,459 --> 00:12:02,261
I have no idea
what kids these days are...

238
00:12:02,263 --> 00:12:05,698
calling their-their parts.

239
00:12:07,835 --> 00:12:10,503
I think they say “junk.”

240
00:12:11,873 --> 00:12:14,707
What is happening to this world?

241
00:12:15,943 --> 00:12:20,079
What-what do you
actually need to know?

242
00:12:21,516 --> 00:12:24,016
This is an important night
for us,

243
00:12:24,018 --> 00:12:26,785
and I'm worried
I might be overwhelmed

244
00:12:26,787 --> 00:12:29,121
and ruin everything.

245
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:33,893
Sheldon, if-if you're
with the right person,

246
00:12:33,895 --> 00:12:36,529
it-it'll be okay.

247
00:12:38,866 --> 00:12:41,133
Thank you, Arthur.

248
00:12:41,135 --> 00:12:44,303
You are the wisest of the wise.

249
00:12:44,305 --> 00:12:46,972
Well, that's-that's very nice
of you to say,

250
00:12:46,974 --> 00:12:49,575
but I think
I'm just an expression of...

251
00:12:49,577 --> 00:12:52,545
of your unconscious mind.

252
00:12:52,547 --> 00:12:55,114
Oh, sure. Yeah.

253
00:12:55,116 --> 00:12:59,218
Well, you're fun to look at.

254
00:13:02,790 --> 00:13:04,156
Tonight's the night!

255
00:13:04,158 --> 00:13:06,125
Yeah, the wait
is finally over!

256
00:13:06,127 --> 00:13:09,328
I know. Then you'll finally stop
talking about it!

257
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:11,330
Ready to go?
Let's do this.

258
00:13:11,332 --> 00:13:12,485
Have fun, guys!

259
00:13:12,486 --> 00:13:14,667
We will.
I can't believe Sheldon gave this up.

260
00:13:14,669 --> 00:13:15,358
I know.

261
00:13:15,382 --> 00:13:17,338
We're gonna have
so much more fun than him.

262
00:13:20,041 --> 00:13:22,608
(singsongy):
No, they're not.

263
00:13:22,610 --> 00:13:26,011
Knowing them, they will.

264
00:13:27,181 --> 00:13:29,381
(indistinct chatter)

265
00:13:30,218 --> 00:13:32,818
T minus 15 minutes!

266
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:34,119
Oh, did you hear
from Wil?

267
00:13:34,121 --> 00:13:36,488
Yeah, he's on his way.
Time for bladder check.

268
00:13:36,490 --> 00:13:37,890
Check.

269
00:13:37,892 --> 00:13:39,158
Check.

270
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:41,727
Check. Wait.

271
00:13:42,930 --> 00:13:44,897
Screw it. I'm holding it.

272
00:13:44,899 --> 00:13:46,232
(crowd booing)

273
00:13:46,234 --> 00:13:48,000
What is everyone
booing at?

274
00:13:48,002 --> 00:13:50,202
(booing continues)

275
00:13:54,609 --> 00:13:56,108
Hey, guys. What's up?

276
00:13:57,211 --> 00:13:59,445
Um, hey, Wil.
What you doin'?

277
00:13:59,447 --> 00:14:02,615
I was on<i> Star Trek.</i> I'm just
rooting for the home team.

278
00:14:02,617 --> 00:14:04,416
MAN:
<i>Star Trek</i> stinks!

279
00:14:04,418 --> 00:14:07,686
Yeah? Live long
and suck it!

280
00:14:10,091 --> 00:14:12,258
(romantic music playing)

281
00:14:14,295 --> 00:14:16,228
(knocking)
SHELDON: Birthday girl.

282
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:19,498
Birthday girl.
Birthday girl.

283
00:14:21,969 --> 00:14:23,535
Come in!

284
00:14:23,537 --> 00:14:26,305
Oh!

285
00:14:31,379 --> 00:14:32,411
Hi, Sheldon.

286
00:14:32,413 --> 00:14:33,879
Hello. Sorry I'm late.

287
00:14:33,881 --> 00:14:35,481
I also got you a balloon,

288
00:14:35,483 --> 00:14:38,183
but it floated away,
and I chased it for a while.

289
00:14:38,185 --> 00:14:40,786
That's okay. Come on in.

290
00:14:40,788 --> 00:14:42,087
Thank you.
Mm-hmm.

291
00:14:42,089 --> 00:14:44,990
Um, I'll... I'm gonna go put
these in water.

292
00:14:44,992 --> 00:14:46,659
Okay.

293
00:14:46,661 --> 00:14:49,295
Ooh, this is different, hmm?

294
00:14:49,297 --> 00:14:51,096
Candles and music.

295
00:14:51,098 --> 00:14:52,598
Do you like it?

296
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:54,833
It's kind of spooky.

297
00:14:54,835 --> 00:14:56,602
I can change it back.

298
00:14:56,604 --> 00:14:58,137
No, no, no. It's your birthday.

299
00:14:58,139 --> 00:15:01,840
As long as no one jumps out
in a hockey mask, I'll be fine.

300
00:15:02,677 --> 00:15:05,511
(panting)

301
00:15:05,513 --> 00:15:07,980
So...

302
00:15:09,283 --> 00:15:11,717
What'd you have in mind
for tonight?

303
00:15:11,719 --> 00:15:14,420
I thought I could take you out
to a nice birthday dinner.

304
00:15:14,422 --> 00:15:18,824
If we pick a place east of here,
we might find the balloon.

305
00:15:18,826 --> 00:15:21,860
Um, that sounds nice, but...

306
00:15:21,862 --> 00:15:24,830
I'm not really hungry right now.

307
00:15:24,832 --> 00:15:27,466
I thought maybe...

308
00:15:27,468 --> 00:15:31,103
we could do presents first.
Oh.

309
00:15:31,972 --> 00:15:33,605
All right.

310
00:15:33,607 --> 00:15:35,708
Um...

311
00:15:35,710 --> 00:15:39,511
I should probably tell you
something about this gift.

312
00:15:39,513 --> 00:15:43,515
You mean before you...

313
00:15:43,517 --> 00:15:46,719
(suggestively):
give it to me?

314
00:15:48,789 --> 00:15:51,090
Yes.

315
00:15:51,092 --> 00:15:54,960
May I ask you a question
before I...

316
00:15:54,962 --> 00:15:57,796
(suggestively):
give it to you?

317
00:15:57,798 --> 00:16:00,566
Of course.
Why are we saying

318
00:16:00,568 --> 00:16:03,202
“give it to you” like that?

319
00:16:03,204 --> 00:16:05,904
Sheldon,

320
00:16:05,906 --> 00:16:09,241
I know your present is...

321
00:16:09,243 --> 00:16:13,178
for us to be intimate tonight.

322
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:15,581
I see.

323
00:16:15,583 --> 00:16:17,316
Is that all right?

324
00:16:22,823 --> 00:16:25,190
I'm sorry,
but this is a litigious society.

325
00:16:25,192 --> 00:16:27,726
I'm gonna need verbal consent.

326
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:31,730
Yes.

327
00:16:33,067 --> 00:16:36,268
You know what, let me pull a
quick contract off the Internet.

328
00:16:41,242 --> 00:16:44,576
So, if you don't like<i> Star</i>
<i>Wars,</i> why are you here?

329
00:16:44,578 --> 00:16:45,711
Oh, I'm just having fun.

330
00:16:45,713 --> 00:16:47,546
Everyone takes<i> Star</i>
<i>Wars</i> so seriously.

331
00:16:47,548 --> 00:16:50,416
Like if the movie's bad,
it's gonna ruin their lives.

332
00:16:50,418 --> 00:16:52,151
Is it bad?
Did you hear something?

333
00:16:52,153 --> 00:16:55,521
Oh, my God. It's bad.
Somebody kill me.

334
00:16:55,523 --> 00:16:58,090
See? That's
what I mean.

335
00:16:58,092 --> 00:16:59,992
When you wake up in the
morning, whether this is

336
00:16:59,994 --> 00:17:02,127
the greatest movie ever
or a total piece of crap,

337
00:17:02,129 --> 00:17:03,729
your life isn't
gonna change at all.

338
00:17:04,598 --> 00:17:06,632
He's right.

339
00:17:06,634 --> 00:17:07,833
Yeah.

340
00:17:07,835 --> 00:17:09,401
No matter what happens,

341
00:17:09,403 --> 00:17:11,537
we're coming back tomorrow
to watch it again.

342
00:17:14,074 --> 00:17:16,442
Do you think Sheldon's actually
gonna go through with it?

343
00:17:16,444 --> 00:17:17,643
I don't know.

344
00:17:17,645 --> 00:17:20,045
He said he's ready.
Yeah, but he also swore

345
00:17:20,047 --> 00:17:22,614
this was the year he'd be able
to pull the guts out

346
00:17:22,616 --> 00:17:24,683
of a pumpkin.

347
00:17:24,685 --> 00:17:26,752
Well, I'm gonna stay positive.
I mean, we talked.

348
00:17:26,754 --> 00:17:29,221
I told him what women like,
and after he stopped giggling,

349
00:17:29,223 --> 00:17:31,623
he seemed pretty sure
of himself.

350
00:17:44,505 --> 00:17:45,904
Hi.

351
00:17:45,906 --> 00:17:48,106
Hello.

352
00:17:49,410 --> 00:17:52,478
So, um...

353
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:55,414
should I get under the covers
with you?

354
00:17:56,250 --> 00:17:58,517
All right.

355
00:18:01,322 --> 00:18:03,522
(clears throat)

356
00:18:18,639 --> 00:18:20,873
Hello.
Hi!

357
00:18:23,677 --> 00:18:26,645
Why are you shaking?
Are you cold?

358
00:18:26,647 --> 00:18:30,115
I'm just, um... really nervous.

359
00:18:30,117 --> 00:18:31,583
Why?

360
00:18:31,585 --> 00:18:34,219
Well...

361
00:18:34,221 --> 00:18:36,655
I've been waiting for this
for so long,

362
00:18:36,657 --> 00:18:40,325
I've just... built it up
in my head.

363
00:18:40,327 --> 00:18:43,228
I don't know
what to expect.

364
00:18:43,230 --> 00:18:46,265
Neither do I.

365
00:18:46,267 --> 00:18:50,903
But... we can find out
together.

366
00:18:52,706 --> 00:18:54,907
Okay.

367
00:19:01,649 --> 00:19:04,816
I'm really nervous.

368
00:19:05,686 --> 00:19:07,085
I know.

369
00:19:07,087 --> 00:19:10,289
We've been waiting so long
for this.

370
00:19:10,291 --> 00:19:14,459
And we've built it up
in our heads so much.

371
00:19:14,461 --> 00:19:17,396
Guys, it's
just a movie.

372
00:19:17,398 --> 00:19:18,897
That's true.

373
00:19:18,899 --> 00:19:20,566
He's right.
It is.

374
00:19:20,568 --> 00:19:24,703
Although, we all
remember Jar Jar.

375
00:19:24,705 --> 00:19:28,307
Leonard,
I-I'm scared again.

376
00:19:33,847 --> 00:19:37,916
Well, I enjoyed that
more than I thought I would.

377
00:19:44,725 --> 00:19:47,993
Me, too.

378
00:19:47,995 --> 00:19:53,198
I look forward to your next
birthday when we do it again.

379
00:19:54,635 --> 00:19:56,902
That works for me.

380
00:19:56,904 --> 00:20:00,539
I enjoyed that
more than I thought I would.

381
00:20:03,344 --> 00:20:07,546
I don't think
I can walk right now.

382
00:20:15,634 --> 00:20:18,302
ARTHUR:
Uh, Sheldon?

383
00:20:18,304 --> 00:20:20,337
Sheldon.

384
00:20:20,339 --> 00:20:21,605
Arthur.

385
00:20:21,607 --> 00:20:22,973
What are you
doing here?

386
00:20:22,975 --> 00:20:24,007
I-I don't think

387
00:20:24,009 --> 00:20:26,643
I need any more advice.

388
00:20:26,645 --> 00:20:29,246
I-I was just curious.

389
00:20:30,416 --> 00:20:33,884
How-How'd it go?

390
00:20:33,886 --> 00:20:35,652
Oh.

391
00:20:38,324 --> 00:20:39,990
It was amazing.

392
00:20:40,759 --> 00:20:42,292
I-I saw it a few days later.

393
00:20:42,294 --> 00:20:44,595
What a movie.

394
00:20:48,767 --> 00:20:51,668
But, uh, what-what about Amy?

395
00:20:51,670 --> 00:20:54,671
Oh. Uh, uh, she liked it fine.

396
00:20:54,673 --> 00:20:59,176
But she doesn't have the history
with the franchise I do.

397
00:21:00,012 --> 00:21:02,512
Okay.

398
00:21:02,514 --> 00:21:05,082
Good... good talk.
