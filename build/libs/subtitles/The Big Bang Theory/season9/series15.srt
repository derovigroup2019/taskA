00:00:02,450 --> 00:00:04,117
Hey, gentlemen.
Hey. - Hey.

2
00:00:04,119 --> 00:00:05,919
Hello.
If any of you are looking for

3
00:00:05,921 --> 00:00:08,821
something to do on Valentine's
Day, Amy and I'll be streaming

4
00:00:08,823 --> 00:00:12,058
our first-ever live episode
of<i> Fun With Flags.</i>

5
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:14,360
You're welcome to join us
as we celebrate the timeless

6
00:00:14,362 --> 00:00:18,331
love affair between
wind and flapping fabric.

7
00:00:18,333 --> 00:00:20,500
Penny and I have dinner
reservations that night,

8
00:00:20,502 --> 00:00:23,002
but any other time, no.

9
00:00:24,773 --> 00:00:25,838
Sorry, Bernie and I
are breaking in

10
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:27,874
the new hot tub,
if you know what I mean.

11
00:00:27,876 --> 00:00:29,909
Not a clue. Raj?

12
00:00:29,911 --> 00:00:32,579
Spending Valentine's Day
with Emily.

13
00:00:32,581 --> 00:00:33,813
You don't sound

14
00:00:33,815 --> 00:00:35,181
very excited about it.

15
00:00:35,183 --> 00:00:37,450
Oh, I am, I am.
I g... I guess

16
00:00:37,452 --> 00:00:39,819
I'm still wondering if Emily
and I are right for each other.

17
00:00:39,821 --> 00:00:42,989
Does this have to do with
that girl you had coffee with?

18
00:00:42,991 --> 00:00:46,159
You mean the strong, sexy angel
I can't stop thinking about?

19
00:00:46,161 --> 00:00:48,361
Who can say?

20
00:00:48,363 --> 00:00:51,197
You've been talking about
breaking up with Emily forever.

21
00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:52,999
Why don't you just do it already?
Yeah, just

22
00:00:53,001 --> 00:00:54,167
get it over with.
Well, you

23
00:00:54,169 --> 00:00:55,368
say it like it's easy.

24
00:00:55,370 --> 00:00:56,569
Have any one of you

25
00:00:56,571 --> 00:00:58,438
ever broken up with anyone?

26
00:01:02,077 --> 00:01:04,677
No.
Not really.

27
00:01:04,679 --> 00:01:08,381
You know, uh, once I ordered
an Uber by accident.

28
00:01:08,383 --> 00:01:11,751
I just got in
and went somewhere.

29
00:01:11,753 --> 00:01:15,255
? Our whole universe
was in a hot, dense state ?

30
00:01:15,257 --> 00:01:18,725
? Then nearly 14 billion years
ago expansion started... Wait! ?

31
00:01:18,727 --> 00:01:20,360
? The Earth began to cool ?

32
00:01:20,362 --> 00:01:22,895
? The autotrophs began to drool,
Neanderthals developed tools ?

33
00:01:22,897 --> 00:01:25,565
? We built the Wall ?
?<i> We built the pyramids</i> ?

34
00:01:25,567 --> 00:01:28,234
? Math, Science, History,
unraveling the mystery ?

35
00:01:28,236 --> 00:01:30,136
? That all started
with a big bang ?

36
00:01:30,138 --> 00:01:31,738
?<i> Bang!</i> ?

39
00:01:41,651 --> 00:01:44,419
So, you really
gonna break up with her?

40
00:01:44,421 --> 00:01:47,989
Yeah, I think so.
Do you have any advice?

41
00:01:47,991 --> 00:01:50,492
Well, I have broken up
with my fair share of guys.

42
00:01:50,494 --> 00:01:52,794
I mean, how many times
did I break up with Leonard?

43
00:01:52,796 --> 00:01:55,697
I stopped
counting at four.

44
00:01:55,699 --> 00:01:57,732
All right, my advice to you
is do it at her place

45
00:01:57,734 --> 00:01:59,567
so you can leave
when you need to,

46
00:01:59,569 --> 00:02:00,902
uh, tell the truth,
make it quick

47
00:02:00,904 --> 00:02:03,505
and be prepared for tears.

48
00:02:03,507 --> 00:02:05,173
Oh, I'm gonna do a pre-cry
before I go in there.

49
00:02:05,175 --> 00:02:07,742
Really dry myself out.

50
00:02:08,645 --> 00:02:10,278
She meant Emily.

51
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:13,648
No, I-I really didn't.

52
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:16,451
You're seriously
breaking up with me?

53
00:02:16,453 --> 00:02:17,719
Yeah.

54
00:02:17,721 --> 00:02:19,187
And you thought
right before Valentine's Day

55
00:02:19,189 --> 00:02:20,989
was a good time to do it?

56
00:02:22,325 --> 00:02:25,360
You're right--
let's talk again in a few days.

57
00:02:25,362 --> 00:02:29,130
Hey, Claire.
Hi. It's-it's Rajesh.

58
00:02:29,132 --> 00:02:31,766
I was-I was wondering if you're
free for Valentine's Day?

59
00:02:31,768 --> 00:02:34,269
Sorry, I just got back
with my boyfriend.

60
00:02:34,271 --> 00:02:36,438
But I just broke up
with my girlfriend.

61
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:38,406
Right before Valentine's Day?

62
00:02:38,408 --> 00:02:40,508
What an ass.

63
00:02:40,510 --> 00:02:42,844
Please take me back.
Our love was meant to be!

64
00:02:44,681 --> 00:02:48,116
I'm gonna all alone
on Valentine's Day.

65
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:53,354
Well, you were
right-- tears.

66
00:02:54,524 --> 00:02:58,259
Okay, and we are live
in 22 minutes.

67
00:02:58,261 --> 00:03:00,161
I'm nervous.
I hope people

68
00:03:00,163 --> 00:03:02,964
will be around to watch even
though it's Valentine's Day.

69
00:03:02,966 --> 00:03:06,201
People who are fans
of an Internet show about flags?

70
00:03:06,203 --> 00:03:08,369
Trust me, they're around.

71
00:03:08,371 --> 00:03:11,139
Oh, and speaking
of Valentine's Day, I haven't

72
00:03:11,141 --> 00:03:12,373
forgotten about you tonight.

73
00:03:12,375 --> 00:03:13,541
What do you mean?

74
00:03:13,543 --> 00:03:15,176
Well, you've become
such an integral

75
00:03:15,178 --> 00:03:17,712
part of my life
as well as this show,

76
00:03:17,714 --> 00:03:20,949
I felt it only right to include
your name in the title.

77
00:03:20,951 --> 00:03:23,017
Oh.

78
00:03:23,019 --> 00:03:24,486
That is so sweet.

79
00:03:24,488 --> 00:03:27,856
So from now on, this program
will be officially known as

80
00:03:27,858 --> 00:03:29,858
<i>Dr. Sheldon Cooper</i>

81
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:31,359

82
00:03:31,361 --> 00:03:34,362
<i>present Dr. Sheldon' Cooper's</i>
<i>Fun With Flags.</i>

83
00:03:37,701 --> 00:03:39,067
Catchy.

84
00:03:43,206 --> 00:03:47,075
I'm gonna
check the temp on the tub.

85
00:03:47,077 --> 00:03:48,309
Don't make it too hot.

86
00:03:48,311 --> 00:03:49,978
Sorry, but "too hot"

87
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:52,347
is the only temperature
I come in.

88
00:03:58,021 --> 00:03:59,220
Look at that--

89
00:03:59,222 --> 00:04:01,523
you shaved it all.

90
00:04:02,792 --> 00:04:04,192
You're welcome.

91
00:04:06,563 --> 00:04:09,364
Um, question--
this is my first hot tub--

92
00:04:09,366 --> 00:04:12,867
is it supposed to come with
a rat flopping around in it?

93
00:04:12,869 --> 00:04:16,671
Ew, really? Get it out.

94
00:04:16,673 --> 00:04:18,573
How?
Uh...

95
00:04:18,575 --> 00:04:19,774
wish we had a skimmer.

96
00:04:19,776 --> 00:04:20,975
Uh, you turn off the jets,

97
00:04:20,977 --> 00:04:23,645
I'll get a strainer
from the kitchen.

98
00:04:23,647 --> 00:04:25,313
I don't know how
to turn off the jets.

99
00:04:25,315 --> 00:04:28,416
Good, I don't know
where we keep the strainer.

100
00:04:29,996 --> 00:04:31,940
Excuse me.

101
00:04:31,941 --> 00:04:33,440
Uh, bad news.

102
00:04:33,442 --> 00:04:35,542
The ma?tre d' said
it's gonna be at least an hour.

103
00:04:35,544 --> 00:04:37,744
An hour? What? That's crazy.
We have a reservation.

104
00:04:37,746 --> 00:04:39,646
I know.
So what did you say?

105
00:04:39,648 --> 00:04:42,282
Thanks, sorry to bother you.

106
00:04:42,284 --> 00:04:46,253
But I said it like a badass.

107
00:04:47,423 --> 00:04:48,622
All right, well,
can't you, like,

108
00:04:48,624 --> 00:04:50,090
slip him some money
or something?

109
00:04:50,092 --> 00:04:52,159
Really? I've never done that
before. Does it work?

110
00:04:52,161 --> 00:04:54,895
Do people like money--
is that what you're asking?

111
00:04:54,897 --> 00:04:56,830
A... a lot of attitude
from the woman

112
00:04:56,832 --> 00:04:59,399
who thought MC squared
was a rapper.

113
00:04:59,401 --> 00:05:01,602
Now, is that a smart thing
to say on a holiday

114
00:05:01,604 --> 00:05:03,871
that's basically
national sex night?

115
00:05:03,873 --> 00:05:06,507
I'm sorry.
You're pretty, I'm stupid.

116
00:05:08,677 --> 00:05:10,477
Hello. Uh,

117
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:12,379
just checked again
for Hofstadter.

118
00:05:12,381 --> 00:05:13,380
Still gonna be an hour?

119
00:05:13,382 --> 00:05:14,815
(clicks tongue)
I'm afraid so.

120
00:05:14,817 --> 00:05:17,017
Okay. Thanks.

121
00:05:18,254 --> 00:05:19,720
Hey.

122
00:05:21,190 --> 00:05:22,356
I think

123
00:05:22,358 --> 00:05:25,058
you may have dropped this?

124
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:26,660
Oh.

125
00:05:26,662 --> 00:05:28,295
Did anybody lose a 20?

126
00:05:28,297 --> 00:05:30,497
I did.

, we are live

four, three...

131
00:05:49,752 --> 00:05:51,418
Oh, wait. Oh, shoot,
I already pushed the button.

132
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:52,486
Never mind, we're live.

133
00:05:52,488 --> 00:05:54,721
Uh, hello

134
00:05:54,723 --> 00:05:56,623

Consider tonight's episode

139
00:06:07,536 --> 00:06:10,704
a Valentine's Day gift
for you, our viewers.

140
00:06:11,807 --> 00:06:14,708
It's also my gift to you.
That was clear, right?

141
00:06:14,710 --> 00:06:16,270
'Cause you're not
getting anything else.

142
00:06:17,947 --> 00:06:19,446
Since we're live,

143
00:06:19,448 --> 00:06:21,281
you'll finally
be able to reach out to us

144
00:06:21,283 --> 00:06:24,218
with your flag thoughts
and flag questions.

145
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:27,621
Allow us to answer a few quick
ones that we get all the time.

146
00:06:27,623 --> 00:06:30,123
Uh, uh, yes, I
really am a doctor.

147
00:06:30,125 --> 00:06:33,193
Uh, yes, she really
is my girlfriend.

148
00:06:33,195 --> 00:06:36,029
No, I just blink a lot,

149
00:06:36,031 --> 00:06:38,265
it's not Morse code
for "rescue me."

150
00:06:43,105 --> 00:06:45,505
(ringing)

151
00:06:45,507 --> 00:06:47,140
Oh, uh, ok...

152
00:06:47,142 --> 00:06:50,210
Uh, here's our first call.

153
00:06:50,212 --> 00:06:52,679
Hello, and welcome
to<i> Fun With Flags.</i>

154
00:06:52,681 --> 00:06:54,314
What's your question?

155
00:06:54,316 --> 00:06:55,882
KOOTHRAPPALI:
What is wrong with me?

156
00:06:55,884 --> 00:06:58,085
Why am I so self-destructive?

157
00:07:00,089 --> 00:07:01,555
Rajesh?

158
00:07:01,557 --> 00:07:06,059
Yes.

159
00:07:06,061 --> 00:07:08,695
You two look happy--
how do you do it?

160
00:07:08,697 --> 00:07:09,636
I-I think it starts
with good communication.

161
00:07:09,637 --> 00:07:12,722
Yeah, wait, that's not a flag
question. Next caller.

162
00:07:15,304 --> 00:07:17,938
I hope you don't think
I'm just saying this

163
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:20,474
because it's
Valentine's Day, but...

164
00:07:20,476 --> 00:07:22,442
I love you so much.

165
00:07:22,444 --> 00:07:24,678
I'm gonna put this
down your robe.

166
00:07:27,449 --> 00:07:29,816
It's not moving,
but I think it's still alive.

167
00:07:29,818 --> 00:07:33,120
Well, should we put it back
in there a few minutes?

168
00:07:34,189 --> 00:07:35,789
No.

169
00:07:35,791 --> 00:07:38,625
No, and it's not a rat,
it's a rabbit.

170
00:07:38,627 --> 00:07:40,894
We need to save it.

171
00:07:40,896 --> 00:07:42,396
Well, how do we do that?

172
00:07:42,398 --> 00:07:44,398
Um, I don't know,
look it up on your phone.

173
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,466
I-I'm gonna wrap it in a towel.

174
00:07:46,468 --> 00:07:48,468
Um... "taking care

175
00:07:48,470 --> 00:07:50,604
of injured rabbit."

176
00:07:50,606 --> 00:07:51,938
Okay.

177
00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:54,274
Make sure
it's comfortable and warm.

178
00:07:54,276 --> 00:07:57,411
Well, it was just in a hot tub.
I'm gonna say "check."

179
00:07:57,413 --> 00:07:58,845
Anything else?

180
00:07:58,847 --> 00:08:00,147
To make sure it's
not dehydrated,

181
00:08:00,149 --> 00:08:01,515
feed him an
electrolyte solution.

182
00:08:01,517 --> 00:08:02,783
If it's not responding,

183
00:08:02,785 --> 00:08:06,153
use a warm cloth to wash
its face and genitals.

184
00:08:08,090 --> 00:08:10,290
Yeah.

185
00:08:13,329 --> 00:08:14,795
(sighs)
This is ridiculous.

186
00:08:14,797 --> 00:08:16,963
You know, I'm gonna
go talk to the ma?tre d'.

187
00:08:16,965 --> 00:08:18,432
What are you gonna say?

188
00:08:18,434 --> 00:08:21,134
I don't know.
I'm... I'm gonna flirt with him.

189
00:08:21,136 --> 00:08:23,437
I don't know
if I'm comfortable with that.

190
00:08:23,439 --> 00:08:25,138
I'm still
sleeping with you tonight.

191
00:08:25,140 --> 00:08:28,342
See if you can
get a table by the window.

192
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:34,314
Hi there.
What's your name?

193
00:08:34,316 --> 00:08:35,482
Glen.
Oh, boy,

194
00:08:35,484 --> 00:08:38,452
it is crazy in here
tonight, huh, Glen?

195
00:08:38,454 --> 00:08:41,221
Well, you know, Valentine's Day.
Yes. Oh,

196
00:08:41,223 --> 00:08:44,157
bet your girlfriend is super
bummed you had to work tonight.

197
00:08:45,094 --> 00:08:47,327
Anyway, look, we have been
waiting a while,

198
00:08:47,329 --> 00:08:48,762
and I just...
With all

199
00:08:48,764 --> 00:08:51,765
due respect, ma'am,
there's nothing I can do.

200
00:08:51,767 --> 00:08:54,835
(chuckles)
You don't have to call me ma'am.

201
00:08:54,837 --> 00:08:56,303
Okay.
I mean,

202
00:08:56,305 --> 00:08:57,537
we're basically the same age.

203
00:08:57,539 --> 00:08:59,373
(laughs):
Okay.

204
00:09:03,579 --> 00:09:04,778
How old are you?

205
00:09:04,780 --> 00:09:07,080
I'm 21. How old are you?

206
00:09:07,983 --> 00:09:09,449
Just shut up, Glen.

207
00:09:10,586 --> 00:09:12,119
Come on, let's get out of here.

208
00:09:12,121 --> 00:09:15,222
What? Why?
Because I'm young. Let's go.

209
00:09:16,425 --> 00:09:18,992
Rajesh,
it's perfectly normal

210
00:09:18,994 --> 00:09:21,428
to have doubts
after breaking up with someone.

211
00:09:21,430 --> 00:09:23,230
Well, you really think so?

212
00:09:23,232 --> 00:09:25,365
Yeah, you know
what's not normal?

213
00:09:25,367 --> 00:09:28,802
Blubbering about emotions
during a flag show.

214
00:09:28,804 --> 00:09:31,972
Unless that emotion is
excitement over New Zealand

215
00:09:31,974 --> 00:09:33,540
changing their flag.

216
00:09:33,542 --> 00:09:36,943
Yeah, good luck, you crazy
Kiwis, we're rooting for you.

217
00:09:36,945 --> 00:09:38,945
Your friend is hurting.

218
00:09:38,947 --> 00:09:40,313
No,

219
00:09:40,315 --> 00:09:41,548
Sheldon's right.

220
00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:42,783
Emily did say I always

221
00:09:42,785 --> 00:09:44,818
talk about my feelings too much.

222
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:46,686
I-I suppose that

223
00:09:46,688 --> 00:09:49,423
could be a legitimate
concern in a relationship.

224
00:09:49,425 --> 00:09:52,292
Uh, perhaps even
a-a red flag.

225
00:09:52,294 --> 00:09:54,528
And speaking
of red flags,

226
00:09:54,530 --> 00:09:57,864
check out this sexy number
from the former Soviet Union.

227
00:09:57,866 --> 00:09:59,666
Hubba, hubba.

228
00:10:00,803 --> 00:10:01,935
(phone ringing)

229
00:10:01,937 --> 00:10:05,005
Oh. Uh, we-we have
another caller.

230
00:10:05,007 --> 00:10:07,741
Hi. You're on
<i>Fun with Flags.</i>

231
00:10:07,743 --> 00:10:13,346
KRIPKE: Hello. I want to talk
about how lonely I am, too.

232
00:10:13,348 --> 00:10:15,415
Kripke? Is that you?

233
00:10:15,417 --> 00:10:17,918
Yeah, I'm just sitting here
all by myself

234
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:21,221
wondering if I'll ever find
someone to share my life with.

235
00:10:21,223 --> 00:10:23,857
Preferably Asian, 18-24,
no fatties.

236
00:10:26,495 --> 00:10:29,463
Please, all comments
and questions

237
00:10:29,465 --> 00:10:31,164
should be flag-related.

238
00:10:31,166 --> 00:10:35,101
All right. Is my pole
flag-related?

239
00:10:41,376 --> 00:10:44,644
I don't see why not.

240
00:10:52,497 --> 00:10:54,664
He's eating.
That's a good sign.

241
00:10:54,666 --> 00:10:56,533
You're gonna have
to wait one hour

242
00:10:56,535 --> 00:10:58,868
until you can go swimming again.

243
00:10:58,870 --> 00:11:00,337
(laughs)

244
00:11:00,339 --> 00:11:03,006
He's pretty cute.
He is.

245
00:11:03,008 --> 00:11:05,909
Should we... name him?

246
00:11:05,911 --> 00:11:07,978
It is Valentine's Day.

247
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:10,113
How about Valentino?

248
00:11:10,949 --> 00:11:14,084
Nice. A classic rabbit name.

249
00:11:14,086 --> 00:11:15,685
(both laugh)

250
00:11:15,687 --> 00:11:19,756
Peter Rabbit, Roger Rabbit.
Valentino Wolowitz Rabbit.

251
00:11:21,426 --> 00:11:24,160
Oh, look at all that
chest hair and overbite.

252
00:11:24,162 --> 00:11:25,929
Of course you're a Wolowitz.

253
00:11:25,931 --> 00:11:27,864
(both laugh)

254
00:11:27,866 --> 00:11:30,066
Son of a bitch! He bit me!

255
00:11:30,068 --> 00:11:31,968
Are you okay?

256
00:11:31,970 --> 00:11:33,336
No, I'm not okay!

257
00:11:33,338 --> 00:11:35,238
Wild rabbits
can have rabies!

258
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:38,074
Oh. Well, why did you put
your finger near its mouth?

259
00:11:38,076 --> 00:11:40,910
Poor judgment, obviously.

260
00:11:40,912 --> 00:11:44,514
He's so little. I'm sure it's fine.
How can it be fine?

261
00:11:44,516 --> 00:11:48,118
I just got attacked by a clearly
anti-Semitic wild animal.

262
00:11:50,389 --> 00:11:54,457
It's not what we planned,
but this isn't so bad, right?

263
00:11:54,459 --> 00:11:57,927
It is freaking amazing.

264
00:11:57,929 --> 00:12:00,463
Well, glad
you're feeling better.

265
00:12:00,465 --> 00:12:02,499
I was just hungry and cranky,

266
00:12:02,501 --> 00:12:05,001
and I've never been called
"ma'am" before.

267
00:12:05,003 --> 00:12:06,503
Is that a big deal?

268
00:12:06,505 --> 00:12:09,472
Kind of. When was the first time
someone called you "sir"?

269
00:12:09,474 --> 00:12:10,907
Sixth grade,

270
00:12:10,909 --> 00:12:13,843
but I wore a sport coat
and carried a briefcase, so...

271
00:12:14,679 --> 00:12:17,781
Can you believe
when I met you I was 22?

272
00:12:17,783 --> 00:12:19,682
(laughs)
I mean, it's crazy!

273
00:12:19,684 --> 00:12:21,384
Where did all that time go?

274
00:12:21,386 --> 00:12:25,388
Mm, you watched
<i>The Bachelor</i> a lot.

275
00:12:25,390 --> 00:12:27,223
Yeah, go ahead and make jokes,

276
00:12:27,225 --> 00:12:28,958
but your thirties
are almost over.

277
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:30,393
No, they're not.

278
00:12:30,395 --> 00:12:32,295
You're closer to 40
than you are 30.

279
00:12:32,297 --> 00:12:35,865
Ha, ha! You
married an old man.

280
00:12:35,867 --> 00:12:37,834
Tell you what.

281
00:12:37,836 --> 00:12:39,335
Let's do something
fun tonight.

282
00:12:39,337 --> 00:12:40,637
Won't make us any younger.

283
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:43,273
Well, maybe not, but some
day we actually will be old,

284
00:12:43,275 --> 00:12:45,108
and we'll look
back on this night

285
00:12:45,110 --> 00:12:47,243
and remember what
a good time we had.

286
00:12:47,245 --> 00:12:49,212
Okay, like what?

287
00:12:49,214 --> 00:12:52,315
I know. Food fight!

288
00:12:57,756 --> 00:13:00,356
I'll keep thinking.

289
00:13:02,694 --> 00:13:06,096
Look, I know you both feel bad
about being alone, but sometimes

290
00:13:06,098 --> 00:13:09,499
the best thing you can do is
take a little time for yourself,

291
00:13:09,501 --> 00:13:11,968
especially when you just
got out of a relationship.

292
00:13:11,970 --> 00:13:14,204
Speaking of ending
relationships,

293
00:13:14,206 --> 00:13:18,575
when British Honduras
became Belize,

294
00:13:18,577 --> 00:13:21,311
they designed a new
flag with a tree on it,

295
00:13:21,313 --> 00:13:25,348
and I would like to hang
myself from that tree.

296
00:13:29,688 --> 00:13:32,555
But, Amy,
when you and Sheldon split up,

297
00:13:32,557 --> 00:13:34,757
didn't you start dating someone
right away?

298
00:13:34,759 --> 00:13:37,293
Well, I... I wouldn't
say right away.

299
00:13:37,295 --> 00:13:40,263
And actually, it was
three different men.

300
00:13:40,265 --> 00:13:42,132
KRIPKE:
Three different men?!

301
00:13:42,134 --> 00:13:46,870
Damn, girl,
way to give the milk away?

302
00:13:46,872 --> 00:13:49,439
Oh, looks like
we just lost Kripke.

303
00:13:49,441 --> 00:13:52,642
Actually, I'm still here.

304
00:13:52,644 --> 00:13:54,677
Now?
Yup.

305
00:13:54,679 --> 00:13:56,513
Now?
Yup!

306
00:13:56,515 --> 00:13:58,515
Now?

307
00:13:58,517 --> 00:14:02,051
Oh, looks like
we just lost Kripke.

308
00:14:02,053 --> 00:14:04,020
Before Emily,
I was alone for so long.

309
00:14:04,022 --> 00:14:06,556
I just... I don't know
if I can do that again.

310
00:14:06,558 --> 00:14:08,091
Well, you know,
here is something

311
00:14:08,093 --> 00:14:09,425
that might cheer you up.

312
00:14:09,427 --> 00:14:13,396
The flag of the Isle of Man
is nothing but three legs

313
00:14:13,398 --> 00:14:16,733
sharing a weird pair
of underpants, so...

314
00:14:16,735 --> 00:14:19,002
you think you
got problems.

315
00:14:20,505 --> 00:14:22,505
I have an idea.

316
00:14:22,507 --> 00:14:24,140
Maybe someone in our audience

317
00:14:24,142 --> 00:14:26,075
would be interested
in meeting Rajesh.

318
00:14:26,077 --> 00:14:28,077
Ladies, I can attest

319
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:30,113
that he is a kind,
handsome, intelligent...

320
00:14:30,115 --> 00:14:32,916
KOOTHRAPPALI: Rich parents!
Don't forget, rich parents!

321
00:14:34,753 --> 00:14:37,187
...spoiled astrophysicist
who not only...

322
00:14:37,189 --> 00:14:38,755
(phone ringing)

323
00:14:38,757 --> 00:14:42,125
Oh. Well, that was quick.

324
00:14:42,127 --> 00:14:44,594
Hi. You're on
<i>Fun with Flags.</i>

325
00:14:44,596 --> 00:14:46,863
KRIPKE:
Hey, I think I got cut off.

326
00:14:49,401 --> 00:14:50,934
Hello, Kripke.

327
00:14:50,936 --> 00:14:53,136
I have a flag question.

328
00:14:53,138 --> 00:14:56,539
How many men
did you have sex with?

329
00:14:57,709 --> 00:15:00,877
Let's see. What's
young and fun?

330
00:15:00,879 --> 00:15:02,879
Uh, we could
go dancing.

331
00:15:02,881 --> 00:15:04,347
Are you actually
gonna dance?

332
00:15:04,349 --> 00:15:05,381
Of course.
Yeah.

333
00:15:05,383 --> 00:15:07,417
No one wants to see that.

334
00:15:07,419 --> 00:15:09,953
Hey, how about skinny dipping
at the beach?

335
00:15:09,955 --> 00:15:13,022
No, I don't need
any fish nibbling my business.

336
00:15:14,859 --> 00:15:16,859
Oh, there's a screening
of<i> Moulin Rouge!</i>

337
00:15:16,861 --> 00:15:18,628
I heard the crowd
sings along and stuff.

338
00:15:18,630 --> 00:15:20,330
That sounds fun.
When's it start?

339
00:15:20,332 --> 00:15:22,198
Midnight.

340
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:23,900
Midnight. Really?

341
00:15:23,902 --> 00:15:25,768
You know what? Let's do it.

342
00:15:25,770 --> 00:15:27,337
Okay, great!

343
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:30,840
Oh, wait. Uh, it's sold out.

344
00:15:30,842 --> 00:15:33,176
Oh, thank God.
Yes!

345
00:15:34,279 --> 00:15:36,579
It says, rabies
in rabbits is

346
00:15:36,581 --> 00:15:37,914
highly unlikely.

347
00:15:37,916 --> 00:15:39,849
Oh, terrific.
It's not terrific.

348
00:15:39,851 --> 00:15:41,618
Lots of highly unlikely things
happen.

349
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:45,421
You saw what's under this robe,
and you still married me.

350
00:15:45,423 --> 00:15:47,624
If you're really worried,
we'll take him to the vet

351
00:15:47,626 --> 00:15:48,825
and have him tested.
Good.

352
00:15:48,827 --> 00:15:51,194
Thank you. Oh, okay,
there is a test!

353
00:15:51,196 --> 00:15:53,196
All they have to do is...

354
00:15:53,198 --> 00:15:55,231
cut off his head
and check his brain.

355
00:15:55,233 --> 00:15:57,367
Oh, cut off his head?

356
00:15:57,369 --> 00:16:01,137
That's where
his little nose is.

357
00:16:01,139 --> 00:16:04,440
He's not showing
any symptoms.

358
00:16:04,442 --> 00:16:08,211
I guess I'll just go to the
emergency room to be safe.

359
00:16:08,213 --> 00:16:10,480
Howie, this is just
your hypochondria.

360
00:16:10,482 --> 00:16:12,482
No, when I sat
on the mute button

361
00:16:12,484 --> 00:16:15,051
and thought I'd gone deaf,
that was my hypochondria.

362
00:16:23,628 --> 00:16:26,796
We'll find another time
to tell him I'm pregnant.

363
00:16:33,338 --> 00:16:35,471
KOOTHRAPPALI:
I mean, this is the first time

364
00:16:35,473 --> 00:16:37,407
I've ever broken up
with someone.

365
00:16:37,409 --> 00:16:40,343
I just... I didn't realize
it was gonna hurt this much.

366
00:16:40,345 --> 00:16:42,312
It really can.

367
00:16:42,314 --> 00:16:44,514
All right.

368
00:16:45,817 --> 00:16:48,718
Nothing about
this is fun.

369
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:51,521
No one wants to
talk about flags,

370
00:16:51,523 --> 00:16:55,024
and I haven't spoken
in over ten minutes,

371
00:16:55,026 --> 00:16:58,294
so, enjoy your
new show, Internet.

372
00:16:58,296 --> 00:17:02,965
<i>Dr. Amy Farrah Flower</i>
<i>Present... With.</i>

373
00:17:05,470 --> 00:17:07,503
KOOTHRAPPALI:
I'm sorry for bothering you.

374
00:17:07,505 --> 00:17:08,938
I'll hang up now.

375
00:17:08,940 --> 00:17:10,473
No, hold on, Rajesh.

376
00:17:10,475 --> 00:17:12,375
You know, you're not being
very sympathetic.

377
00:17:12,377 --> 00:17:14,510
You know firsthand
that breakups are hard.

378
00:17:14,512 --> 00:17:16,946
Fine.

379
00:17:16,948 --> 00:17:19,615
If you insist on making
me a part of this,

380
00:17:19,617 --> 00:17:21,984
yes, I knowledge how
painful they can be.

381
00:17:21,986 --> 00:17:26,589
However, pain has an
evolutionary purpose.

382
00:17:26,591 --> 00:17:29,492
It provides information
from the environment

383
00:17:29,494 --> 00:17:32,061
that, uh, behavior
isn't good for us.

384
00:17:32,063 --> 00:17:34,530
KRIPKE: Like when I fell in love
with that stripper

385
00:17:34,532 --> 00:17:36,733
and bought her a Prius.

386
00:17:38,770 --> 00:17:41,137
I'm just gonna push
all the buttons.

387
00:17:43,041 --> 00:17:45,742
Raj, now, I'm sorry
you're suffering.

388
00:17:45,744 --> 00:17:48,945
When Amy and I were
broken up, I also suffered.

389
00:17:48,947 --> 00:17:51,314
And this may
sound surprising,

390
00:17:51,316 --> 00:17:53,683
but I'm grateful for
having gone through it.

391
00:17:53,685 --> 00:17:55,685
Really?

392
00:17:55,687 --> 00:17:57,720
Yes.

393
00:17:57,722 --> 00:18:02,091
I believe our relationship
now is stronger than ever.

394
00:18:02,093 --> 00:18:04,694
So do I.

395
00:18:04,696 --> 00:18:06,129
When-when we were apart,

396
00:18:06,131 --> 00:18:08,297
I learned how important
you are to me.

397
00:18:08,299 --> 00:18:10,466
And I realize

398
00:18:10,468 --> 00:18:13,069
that when two people are
in love, sometimes they...

399
00:18:13,071 --> 00:18:15,238
BOTH:
Happy Valentine's Day!

400
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:19,075
(whooping)

401
00:18:19,077 --> 00:18:21,477
We are young and fun!

402
00:18:21,479 --> 00:18:25,214
(horn honking)

403
00:18:26,785 --> 00:18:28,818
I stand corrected.

404
00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:31,320
<i>Fun.</i>

405
00:18:39,940 --> 00:18:43,075
Congratulations on a
successful live show.

406
00:18:43,077 --> 00:18:45,811
And a lovely
Valentine's Day.

407
00:18:47,848 --> 00:18:52,050
Cleaning up
is not young and fun.

408
00:18:52,052 --> 00:18:54,286
It can be.
Confetti fight!

409
00:18:59,427 --> 00:19:01,493
Maybe you should take a break.

410
00:19:01,495 --> 00:19:03,028
I got this.

411
00:19:05,633 --> 00:19:10,836
Did you know the singular
of confetti is "confetto"?

412
00:19:10,838 --> 00:19:14,673
Interesting, and when
would you use the singular?

413
00:19:14,675 --> 00:19:15,741
I'm glad you asked.

414
00:19:15,743 --> 00:19:18,811
Amy, you have a
confetto in your nose.

415
00:19:18,813 --> 00:19:22,018
No, no, no, no. Other
side. There you go.
