1
00:00:01,611 --> 00:00:02,890
Can we start the movie?

2
00:00:03,405 --> 00:00:05,138
Before Sheldon gets here?

3
00:00:05,140 --> 00:00:07,807
Last time we did that, he didn't
talk to us for a month.

4
00:00:07,809 --> 00:00:10,610
So do it!

5
00:00:10,612 --> 00:00:12,178
Hold on. Where is he?

6
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:15,381
Well, according to his text,
he was on the second floor,

7
00:00:15,383 --> 00:00:18,184
then he stopped
to tie his shoe.

8
00:00:20,121 --> 00:00:21,788
All tied, and...

9
00:00:21,790 --> 00:00:23,656
Hello!
Hi.

10
00:00:23,658 --> 00:00:25,091
Sorry we're late.

11
00:00:25,093 --> 00:00:28,561
Amy took forever
tying my shoe.

12
00:00:28,563 --> 00:00:29,829
All right!

13
00:00:29,831 --> 00:00:31,798
Who's excited
to see a documentary?

14
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:33,099
Oh, I know this one.

15
00:00:33,101 --> 00:00:34,300
Nobody ever.

16
00:00:34,302 --> 00:00:36,669
Hey! This one's
going to be great.

17
00:00:36,671 --> 00:00:37,871
This is about the rivalry

18
00:00:37,873 --> 00:00:40,406
between a cool renegade
scientist, Nikola Tesla,

19
00:00:40,408 --> 00:00:42,775
and his arch-nemesis,
Thomas Edison.

20
00:00:42,777 --> 00:00:44,777
It's the greatest
scientific feud of all time.

21
00:00:44,779 --> 00:00:47,647
I mean, you can forget
about Leibniz and Newton.

22
00:00:47,649 --> 00:00:49,015
Done.

23
00:00:49,017 --> 00:00:52,886
So, Tesla's the one
that invented the electric car?

24
00:00:54,289 --> 00:00:55,655
No, Penny.

25
00:00:55,657 --> 00:00:58,358
No, the car is just
named after him.

26
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:00,059
Okay, you don't have to be
so smug about it.

27
00:01:00,061 --> 00:01:01,694
You know, you went
to see that movie <i>It</i>

28
00:01:01,696 --> 00:01:04,330
because you thought
it was about scary I.T. guys.

29
00:01:06,601 --> 00:01:09,602
Tesla was a genius who
invented our electrical grid.

30
00:01:09,604 --> 00:01:11,738
Edison just wanted to
get rich and famous.

31
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:13,339
Didn't he invent the lightbulb?

32
00:01:13,341 --> 00:01:15,008
That's what
he wants you to think.

33
00:01:15,010 --> 00:01:17,143
But without the foundational
work of Ebenezer Kinnersley,

34
00:01:17,145 --> 00:01:19,545
Warren de la Rue
and James Bowman Lindsay,

35
00:01:19,547 --> 00:01:21,648
you wouldn't know Edison
any more than you know

36
00:01:21,650 --> 00:01:24,817
Ebenezer Kinnersley, Warren de
la Rue or James Bowman Lindsay.

37
00:01:25,687 --> 00:01:28,955
Isn't he sexy
all fired up?

38
00:01:28,957 --> 00:01:30,890
He really gets
my current alternating,

39
00:01:30,892 --> 00:01:33,526
if you know what I mean.

40
00:01:33,528 --> 00:01:36,529
Edison was kind of a
publicity hog and a bully.

41
00:01:36,531 --> 00:01:38,298
Yeah, he electrocuted
an elephant named Topsy

42
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:39,565
just to make himself famous.

43
00:01:39,567 --> 00:01:41,167
If I had an elephant
named Topsy,

44
00:01:41,169 --> 00:01:42,669
he would want for nothing.

45
00:01:43,838 --> 00:01:46,472
Also, he'd be named Jumbo.

46
00:01:46,474 --> 00:01:50,009
And worse than that, Edison
filmed the first on-screen kiss,

47
00:01:50,011 --> 00:01:53,346
so he's basically
a pornographer.

48
00:01:54,349 --> 00:01:56,082
Although every time
I put that in Wikipedia,

49
00:01:56,084 --> 00:01:59,185
someone takes it out.

50
00:01:59,187 --> 00:02:01,721
Is your current
still alternating?

51
00:02:01,723 --> 00:02:04,958
We're lucky there aren't
any elephants in here.

52
00:02:06,428 --> 00:02:10,063
? Our whole universe
was in a hot, dense state ?

53
00:02:10,065 --> 00:02:13,366
? Then nearly 14 billion years
ago expansion started... Wait! ?

54
00:02:13,368 --> 00:02:15,034
? The Earth began to cool ?

55
00:02:15,036 --> 00:02:17,537
? The autotrophs began to drool,
Neanderthals developed tools ?

56
00:02:17,539 --> 00:02:20,206
? We built the Wall ?
? <i>We built the pyramids</i> ?

57
00:02:20,208 --> 00:02:22,875
? Math, Science, History,
unraveling the mystery ?

58
00:02:22,877 --> 00:02:24,777
? That all started
with a big bang ?

59
00:02:24,779 --> 00:02:25,248
? <i>Bang!</i> ?

62
00:02:31,051 --> 00:02:32,918
You know, that documentary
last night was actually

63
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:34,090
better than I
thought it would be.

64
00:02:34,114 --> 00:02:35,221
Really?

65
00:02:35,222 --> 00:02:36,989
Should've been about
Samuel Morse

66
00:02:36,991 --> 00:02:39,792
the way they telegraphed
that ending.

67
00:02:39,794 --> 00:02:41,794
I already pretended to laugh
at that joke once.

68
00:02:41,796 --> 00:02:43,796
Do I have to do it again?

69
00:02:43,798 --> 00:02:46,265
Yeah, I'd appreciate it.

70
00:02:46,267 --> 00:02:49,968
Samuel Morse. You kill me.

71
00:02:52,106 --> 00:02:54,573
Leonard, can you
drive me to work?

72
00:02:54,575 --> 00:02:56,108
Yeah, sure.
Oh, hey, the guys and I

73
00:02:56,110 --> 00:02:57,810
were talking about
going to see the Tesla coil

74
00:02:57,812 --> 00:03:00,078
at the observatory later on,
if you want to join.

75
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:02,214
Oh, I'm sorry, I can't.
I'm busy.

76
00:03:02,216 --> 00:03:04,650
Why? What are you doing?
Leonard, what are <i>you</i> doing?

77
00:03:04,652 --> 00:03:07,452
He said he can't go.
Make a sad face, move on.

78
00:03:07,454 --> 00:03:09,421
It's fine.

79
00:03:09,423 --> 00:03:11,490
I couldn't tell you
even if I wanted to.

80
00:03:11,492 --> 00:03:12,958
What does that mean?
Leonard!

81
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:15,427
Sad face, sad face.

82
00:03:15,429 --> 00:03:18,397
I mean, I would like to,
but I just can't, you know,

83
00:03:18,399 --> 00:03:20,599
because it's classified
and top secret.

84
00:03:20,601 --> 00:03:23,435
Hold on, are you still
working for the military?

85
00:03:23,437 --> 00:03:24,736
I'm so glad
you figured that out!

86
00:03:24,738 --> 00:03:26,905
It was killing me
keeping it a secret!

87
00:03:26,907 --> 00:03:28,540
I thought they
fired you guys.

88
00:03:28,542 --> 00:03:30,676
They did,
but then they hired me back.

89
00:03:30,678 --> 00:03:32,544
Well, you better not be
working on our project,

90
00:03:32,546 --> 00:03:33,679
because we're a team.

91
00:03:33,681 --> 00:03:36,849
Leonard, there is
no "I" in team.

92
00:03:36,851 --> 00:03:38,250
However,
there is an "I" in

93
00:03:38,252 --> 00:03:41,887
"I'm working with the military
and you're not."

94
00:03:41,889 --> 00:03:44,089
There's five of them, in fact.

95
00:03:47,394 --> 00:03:49,228
Hey, hey.

96
00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:50,929
I got a big surprise for you.

97
00:03:50,931 --> 00:03:53,098
Is it pie and ice cream?

98
00:03:54,134 --> 00:03:55,901
Wow, did I oversell it.

99
00:03:55,903 --> 00:03:57,569
It's Raj and Ruchi!

100
00:03:57,571 --> 00:03:59,171
Hello.

101
00:03:59,173 --> 00:04:00,405
Hey. Hi.

102
00:04:00,407 --> 00:04:01,673
Hey, what are
you two doing here?

103
00:04:01,675 --> 00:04:02,708
We won't stay long.

104
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:04,376
I just wanted
to drop something off

105
00:04:04,378 --> 00:04:05,944
from me and the girls at work.

106
00:04:05,946 --> 00:04:08,981
None of the girls at work
like me enough to get me a gift.

107
00:04:08,983 --> 00:04:10,983
Okay, so you'll know
why everyone at the office

108
00:04:10,985 --> 00:04:12,651
has the same handwriting.

109
00:04:12,653 --> 00:04:15,153
I really appreciate
the thought,

110
00:04:15,155 --> 00:04:17,556
but it's not necessary.
I'll be back soon.

111
00:04:17,558 --> 00:04:20,325
Don't worry about work.
You take all the time you need.

112
00:04:20,327 --> 00:04:22,094
Yeah, just turn
off your brain

113
00:04:22,096 --> 00:04:24,463
and let your uterus
do its magic.

114
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,600
It's the star
of the show now.

115
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:32,671
Okay, wasn't sure how long
I should let you guys stay.

116
00:04:32,673 --> 00:04:35,240
Now I know!
Get out!

117
00:04:35,242 --> 00:04:37,309
Good to see you.
You look amazing.

118
00:04:37,311 --> 00:04:39,211
Thanks for coming!

119
00:04:40,214 --> 00:04:42,948
That bitch.

120
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:45,017
Oh, come on, he means well.

121
00:04:45,019 --> 00:04:48,020
He's just trying
to impress his girlfriend.

122
00:04:48,022 --> 00:04:50,055
I'm talking about Ruchi.

123
00:04:50,057 --> 00:04:51,556
She's after my job.

124
00:04:51,558 --> 00:04:54,493
Why do you think she said,
"Take all the time you need"?

125
00:04:54,495 --> 00:04:57,095
Because she was being nice?

126
00:04:57,097 --> 00:05:00,165
No, she's trying to steal
my projects while I'm at home

127
00:05:00,167 --> 00:05:03,936
taking care of this useless
plant and my dumb family.

128
00:05:03,938 --> 00:05:07,639
I'm only saying this
because I love you

129
00:05:07,641 --> 00:05:09,875
and because you can't
reach me from that bed,

130
00:05:09,877 --> 00:05:12,077
but you sound a little crazy.

131
00:05:12,079 --> 00:05:15,280
I love you, too, but I could
fling this card in your eye

132
00:05:15,282 --> 00:05:18,183
like a ninja throwing star.

133
00:05:18,185 --> 00:05:19,985
I don't believe you.

134
00:05:25,626 --> 00:05:28,260
Why would the military
want Sheldon?

135
00:05:28,262 --> 00:05:31,630
I don't know. Target practice?

136
00:05:31,632 --> 00:05:34,533
Well, he better not be
working on our guidance system.

137
00:05:34,535 --> 00:05:36,034
That was my idea.

138
00:05:36,036 --> 00:05:37,402
Why don't we call
Colonel Williams

139
00:05:37,404 --> 00:05:39,071
and find out
what's going on.

140
00:05:39,073 --> 00:05:42,107
Great. I want answers
and he'd better give them to us.

141
00:05:44,511 --> 00:05:45,644
Hello, gentlemen.

142
00:05:45,646 --> 00:05:48,747
Hi, sir.
Um, Leonard has a question.

143
00:05:50,784 --> 00:05:53,785
Hey, is Sheldon working on
our project again?

144
00:05:53,787 --> 00:05:55,287
Did he say that?

145
00:05:55,289 --> 00:05:56,555
No, he wouldn't tell us.

146
00:05:56,557 --> 00:06:01,259
Huh. So he <i>can</i>
keep his mouth shut.

147
00:06:01,261 --> 00:06:03,362
How do I get him to do that?

148
00:06:03,364 --> 00:06:07,032
Is he working on
our guidance system or not?

149
00:06:07,034 --> 00:06:10,168
Dr. Cooper contacted us
with an idea on how to modify

150
00:06:10,170 --> 00:06:12,704
your technology into
a communication system,

151
00:06:12,706 --> 00:06:14,106
and it seemed interesting.

152
00:06:14,108 --> 00:06:17,709
But our team developed
that technology.

153
00:06:17,711 --> 00:06:19,311
And he was your team leader.

154
00:06:19,313 --> 00:06:20,946
Well, who said
he was team leader?

155
00:06:20,948 --> 00:06:22,347
He did.

156
00:06:23,317 --> 00:06:25,951
And I like that kind of
"take charge" attitude.

157
00:06:25,953 --> 00:06:28,153
We can have "take
charge" attitudes.

158
00:06:28,155 --> 00:06:30,689
Then why didn't either of you
ask to be team leader?

159
00:06:30,691 --> 00:06:33,291
We didn't want to step
on anyone's toes.

160
00:06:33,293 --> 00:06:35,160
Yeah, so we were just

161
00:06:35,162 --> 00:06:39,264
waiting for you to tell us who
you thought-- Okay, I hear it.

162
00:06:41,068 --> 00:06:42,968
- Are we done?
- No, no.

163
00:06:42,970 --> 00:06:45,737
I am taking charge right
now and telling you

164
00:06:45,739 --> 00:06:47,205
that it is not okay
with us if...

165
00:06:47,207 --> 00:06:50,008
Okay, bye.

166
00:06:53,147 --> 00:06:55,547
Hey. I just got your text.
Everything okay?

167
00:06:55,549 --> 00:06:58,350
Yeah, there's just something
I need to ask you.

168
00:06:58,352 --> 00:07:01,119
Oh, Bernie,
I'd be thrilled.

169
00:07:01,121 --> 00:07:03,288
It's not be my birth coach.

170
00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:06,892
Okay, that hurts, but luckily I
know how to breathe through it.

171
00:07:10,931 --> 00:07:13,799
I need you to find out
if Ruchi's trying to steal

172
00:07:13,801 --> 00:07:15,934
my projects at work
while I'm on bed rest.

173
00:07:15,936 --> 00:07:18,637
She's not that
kind of a person.

174
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:21,440
She's-she's generous
and charitable.

175
00:07:21,442 --> 00:07:23,542
You're just saying that
'cause she's sleeping with you.

176
00:07:23,544 --> 00:07:26,078
Yes, that's my favorite charity.

177
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:31,016
I know I sound paranoid, but
I'm feeling really vulnerable.

178
00:07:31,018 --> 00:07:33,418
If there's anything you could
find out, it'd be great.

179
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:37,456
And if she is up to anything,
what are you gonna do?

180
00:07:37,458 --> 00:07:38,957
Nothing.

181
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:40,659
I'll just calmly
talk to her and explain

182
00:07:40,661 --> 00:07:43,161
there are certain boundaries
that need to be respected.

183
00:07:43,163 --> 00:07:47,165
It's really for the benefit
of everyone at the company.

184
00:07:49,002 --> 00:07:52,304
Uh, okay, what you're saying
sounds nice,

185
00:07:52,306 --> 00:07:53,905
but the way you're saying it

186
00:07:53,907 --> 00:07:57,642
is causing my testicles
to take cover in my abdomen.

187
00:08:00,013 --> 00:08:01,947
What do you want to watch?

188
00:08:01,949 --> 00:08:03,548
Oh, why don't you pick.

189
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:05,450
Okay, how about comedy?

190
00:08:05,452 --> 00:08:08,253
Eh, I already laughed today.

191
00:08:08,255 --> 00:08:12,390
I know. It was when
I stubbed my toe.

192
00:08:12,392 --> 00:08:14,292
Still funny.

193
00:08:14,294 --> 00:08:16,628
Drama?

194
00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:18,697
Nah, I've already
seen someone cry today.

195
00:08:18,699 --> 00:08:20,866
It really hurt, Sheldon!

196
00:08:22,035 --> 00:08:23,602
Hey.

197
00:08:23,604 --> 00:08:25,370
We talked to
Colonel Williams.

198
00:08:25,372 --> 00:08:26,638
He told us everything.

199
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:28,240
I'm sorry, can we do this
another time?

200
00:08:28,242 --> 00:08:32,377
Amy's just about to realize she
wants to watch a Hulk marathon.

201
00:08:32,379 --> 00:08:33,712
What's going on?

202
00:08:33,714 --> 00:08:36,681
Sheldon went to the Air
Force behind our backs.

203
00:08:36,683 --> 00:08:38,316
I did nothing of the sort.

204
00:08:38,318 --> 00:08:39,684
I had an idea

205
00:08:39,686 --> 00:08:41,419
for a neutrino-based
communication system,

206
00:08:41,421 --> 00:08:44,089
I presented it to them,
and they were interested.

207
00:08:44,091 --> 00:08:46,024
But y-your
communication system

208
00:08:46,026 --> 00:08:48,126
was based on our
guidance system.

209
00:08:48,128 --> 00:08:49,995
And sonar is based on bats.

210
00:08:49,997 --> 00:08:51,897
You don't see them
hanging upside down

211
00:08:51,899 --> 00:08:54,032
in a patent attorney's office.

212
00:08:54,034 --> 00:08:57,302
You know what, you like to think
that you're just like Tesla,

213
00:08:57,304 --> 00:08:59,671
but the truth is
you're exactly like Edison.

214
00:08:59,673 --> 00:09:01,106
You take that back.

215
00:09:01,108 --> 00:09:03,041
No, he's right.

216
00:09:03,043 --> 00:09:06,511
You are a bully, a credit
hog and a self-promoter.

217
00:09:06,513 --> 00:09:11,249
And if anyone around here
is like Tesla, it's us.

218
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:15,587
Yeah.

219
00:09:18,292 --> 00:09:21,092
Can you believe they said
I was just like Edison?

220
00:09:21,094 --> 00:09:24,029
Yeah, and in front of
a lady, no less.

221
00:09:24,031 --> 00:09:26,131
Well, you are
building on their work

222
00:09:26,133 --> 00:09:27,632
and taking the
credit for it.

223
00:09:27,634 --> 00:09:29,067
That's a classic
Edison move.

224
00:09:29,069 --> 00:09:30,835
Oh, yeah?

225
00:09:30,837 --> 00:09:32,871
Well, if I'm Edison
and you love me,

226
00:09:32,873 --> 00:09:34,806
then what does that say
about you?

227
00:09:34,808 --> 00:09:36,541
I honestly don't know.

228
00:09:36,543 --> 00:09:38,310
Okay.

229
00:09:38,312 --> 00:09:40,612
Well, I have to Google
some stuff about Mrs. Edison.

230
00:09:40,614 --> 00:09:42,781
I'll be right back.

231
00:09:46,149 --> 00:09:47,548
You know whose fault this is?

232
00:09:47,550 --> 00:09:48,516
I do.

233
00:09:48,518 --> 00:09:50,118
Yours.

234
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:52,320
No, my mother's.

235
00:09:52,322 --> 00:09:54,889
"Go make friends, Sheldon."

236
00:09:55,759 --> 00:09:56,858
What happens?

237
00:09:56,860 --> 00:09:58,860
20 years later,
they call me names.

238
00:09:58,862 --> 00:10:02,764
I don't think what they
called you is the point here.

239
00:10:02,766 --> 00:10:04,832
Oh, yeah?
How would you feel

240
00:10:04,834 --> 00:10:08,069
if I called you the name of a
neuroscientist you didn't like?

241
00:10:08,071 --> 00:10:10,405
Do you know the name
of any neuroscientist?

242
00:10:10,407 --> 00:10:11,873
Of course.

243
00:10:11,875 --> 00:10:13,207
Not me?

244
00:10:13,209 --> 00:10:16,611
Then no.

245
00:10:16,613 --> 00:10:19,414
Do you think they're right, Amy?

246
00:10:20,583 --> 00:10:23,284
Do you think I'm like Edison?

247
00:10:23,286 --> 00:10:27,221
Sheldon, I don't
think you're upset

248
00:10:27,223 --> 00:10:30,391
because of what kind of
scientist they said you're like.

249
00:10:30,393 --> 00:10:32,059
I think you're
upset because

250
00:10:32,061 --> 00:10:34,128
your friend''
feelings got hurt.

251
00:10:34,130 --> 00:10:37,298
You're right.

252
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:40,301
I care too much about
other people's feelings.

253
00:10:41,838 --> 00:10:44,605
It's always been my fatal flaw.

254
00:10:44,607 --> 00:10:47,241
Sheldon, I
don't think...

255
00:10:47,243 --> 00:10:50,044
No, no, not now, Amy.
I'm growing as a person.

256
00:10:52,415 --> 00:10:55,183
Ah, that was fun.

257
00:10:55,185 --> 00:10:57,852
Put her there, buddy.

258
00:10:57,854 --> 00:11:01,189
I am not fist bumping
you after we have sex.

259
00:11:01,191 --> 00:11:03,891
You're the one who wanted
to keep things casual.

260
00:11:03,893 --> 00:11:06,494
There's a difference
between casual and weird.

261
00:11:06,496 --> 00:11:08,796
Not the way I do it.

262
00:11:10,633 --> 00:11:14,302
So, um... how was,
how was your day?

263
00:11:14,304 --> 00:11:16,504
Like, how's-how's work?

264
00:11:16,506 --> 00:11:18,005
Oh, great.

265
00:11:18,007 --> 00:11:19,407
With Bernadette gone,

266
00:11:19,409 --> 00:11:21,742
I'm getting to handle
all her projects.

267
00:11:21,744 --> 00:11:23,411
Well, she's-she's not gone.

268
00:11:23,413 --> 00:11:24,879
She'll be back soon.

269
00:11:24,881 --> 00:11:28,015
Not too soon, let's hope.

270
00:11:29,385 --> 00:11:31,719
So it turns out Ruchi is totally

271
00:11:31,721 --> 00:11:33,454
trying to take over
Bernadette's projects.

272
00:11:33,456 --> 00:11:35,523
Wow, she just told you
that out of the blue?

273
00:11:35,525 --> 00:11:37,325
Yeah, yeah,
we had just made love.

274
00:11:37,327 --> 00:11:39,360
It was so beautiful.

275
00:11:40,330 --> 00:11:41,829
Our caramel-colored bodies

276
00:11:41,831 --> 00:11:44,265
were entwined like
erotic taffy...

277
00:11:44,267 --> 00:11:46,100
Get to the point!
Oh.

278
00:11:46,102 --> 00:11:47,735
Uh, sorry, uh, yeah.

279
00:11:47,737 --> 00:11:50,304
I-I asked her about work,
and she just admitted

280
00:11:50,306 --> 00:11:52,340
she has her eyes
on Bernadette's projects.

281
00:11:52,342 --> 00:11:53,508
Can't believe she
would take advantage

282
00:11:53,510 --> 00:11:54,775
of a pregnant
lady like that.

283
00:11:54,777 --> 00:11:55,877
So what did you do?

284
00:11:55,879 --> 00:11:57,345
What do you think I did?

285
00:11:57,347 --> 00:12:00,615
I made small talk for 20 minutes
and had sex again.

286
00:12:00,617 --> 00:12:03,150
You have to say
something to Bernie.

287
00:12:03,152 --> 00:12:05,486
I don't know. If I do that,
she's gonna confront Ruchi,

288
00:12:05,488 --> 00:12:07,855
and then Ruchi's gonna
stop sleeping with me.

289
00:12:07,857 --> 00:12:09,557
Raj, you can't go on
sleeping with a woman

290
00:12:09,559 --> 00:12:10,925
who's trying to screw
over your friend.

291
00:12:10,927 --> 00:12:14,195
Can't or must?

292
00:12:16,566 --> 00:12:18,633
You know, that guidance system
was my idea.

293
00:12:18,635 --> 00:12:19,934
You figured out
how to make it work.

294
00:12:19,936 --> 00:12:21,335
We didn't even need Sheldon.

295
00:12:21,337 --> 00:12:24,171
Let's not forget your idea
was based on my theory.

296
00:12:24,173 --> 00:12:27,808
Hey, we're bagging
on Sheldon here! Focus!

297
00:12:28,978 --> 00:12:31,946
I guess it was pretty smart
using our quantum technology

298
00:12:31,948 --> 00:12:33,948
as the basis for
a communication system.

299
00:12:33,950 --> 00:12:36,884
Be even better if he swapped out
the helium for xenon.

300
00:12:36,886 --> 00:12:40,588
Ooh. So instead of having to
keep it at negative 271 degrees,

301
00:12:40,590 --> 00:12:42,690
you'd only have to keep it
at negative 108.

302
00:12:42,692 --> 00:12:44,058
It would be way more efficient.

303
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:46,160
And xenon has a bigger nucleus,

304
00:12:46,162 --> 00:12:48,963
so coherence would make it
an easier signal to see.

305
00:12:48,965 --> 00:12:50,197
You're brilliant!

306
00:12:50,199 --> 00:12:51,232
We should tell Sheldon.

307
00:12:51,234 --> 00:12:52,833
You're an idiot!

308
00:12:53,803 --> 00:12:54,969
We don't tell Sheldon.

309
00:12:54,971 --> 00:12:56,537
We go to the military
behind his back

310
00:12:56,539 --> 00:12:58,573
and we screw him
like he screwed us.

311
00:12:58,575 --> 00:12:59,974
All right, you're right,
you're right, we don't need him.

312
00:12:59,976 --> 00:13:01,108
We can do this all on our own.

313
00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:02,066
Do you think
you can do the math?

314
00:13:02,090 --> 00:13:03,317
No.

315
00:13:05,415 --> 00:13:06,614
But if someone else does it,

316
00:13:06,616 --> 00:13:10,017
I can double check
the crap out of it.

317
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:14,288
I want you to know,
I did what you asked.

318
00:13:14,290 --> 00:13:17,224
I talked to Ruchi and found out
what's going on at work.

319
00:13:17,226 --> 00:13:19,260
So is she trying
to steal my projects?

320
00:13:19,262 --> 00:13:21,062
No, not trying to,
sounds like it's a done deal.

321
00:13:21,064 --> 00:13:22,229
Here, have a brownie.

322
00:13:22,231 --> 00:13:24,465
I'm gonna kill her.

323
00:13:24,467 --> 00:13:26,334
Okay, don't take this
out on Ruchi.

324
00:13:26,336 --> 00:13:28,436
Is she trying to
take your job? Yes.

325
00:13:28,438 --> 00:13:29,937
Is she parking
in your space? Yes.

326
00:13:29,939 --> 00:13:31,973
Did she get a laugh
at a meeting yesterday

327
00:13:31,975 --> 00:13:34,275
by calling you "Pregnadette"?
Big one.

328
00:13:35,645 --> 00:13:39,080
But you would've done the exact
same thing, and you know it.

329
00:13:39,082 --> 00:13:41,482
I never would've
undermined a coworker.

330
00:13:41,484 --> 00:13:43,684
What? Oh, please.
Wh-What about that guy Eric,

331
00:13:43,686 --> 00:13:46,354
who you told it was
"Bring Your Cat to Work Day"

332
00:13:46,356 --> 00:13:49,156
when you knew
your boss had asthma?

333
00:13:49,158 --> 00:13:51,459
That was just a hilarious prank

334
00:13:51,461 --> 00:13:54,962
that ended with me
getting a corner office.

335
00:13:54,964 --> 00:13:56,964
All I'm saying is

336
00:13:56,966 --> 00:13:58,566
before you attack Ruchi,
maybe you should

337
00:13:58,568 --> 00:14:00,501
take a long hard look
in the mirror,

338
00:14:00,503 --> 00:14:01,936
because you know
what you'll see--

339
00:14:01,938 --> 00:14:04,505
apart from radiant skin
and luxuriously thick hair?

340
00:14:04,507 --> 00:14:06,007
Hypocrisy!

341
00:14:11,614 --> 00:14:14,615
It is thick.

342
00:14:15,785 --> 00:14:18,052
So what do you think?
Can you make it work?

343
00:14:18,054 --> 00:14:20,221
Uh, I just need to
use the cross section

344
00:14:20,223 --> 00:14:22,890
to calculate the probability
of the interaction.

345
00:14:22,892 --> 00:14:24,291
Can we help?

346
00:14:24,293 --> 00:14:25,626
Yes.

347
00:14:25,628 --> 00:14:28,362
Why don't you run
get me a can of Pringles.

348
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:31,666
Leonard, I was--

349
00:14:31,668 --> 00:14:34,235
What's Kripke doing here?

350
00:14:34,237 --> 00:14:36,370
Oh, he's just helping us
develop a better, more efficient

351
00:14:36,372 --> 00:14:38,572
neutrino comm system that we're
gonna pitch to the military,

352
00:14:38,574 --> 00:14:39,740
making yours obsolete.

353
00:14:39,742 --> 00:14:40,841
Yeah,
Leonard thought of it.

354
00:14:40,843 --> 00:14:42,276
It's genius.
Oh, thanks.

355
00:14:42,278 --> 00:14:44,111
You see, instead of
using liquid helium...

356
00:14:44,113 --> 00:14:46,414
Good God, man, shut up!
Right, sorry.

357
00:14:46,416 --> 00:14:47,882
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

358
00:14:47,884 --> 00:14:50,051
You didn't tell me
we were doing this

359
00:14:50,053 --> 00:14:51,519
just to stick it to Sheldon.

360
00:14:51,521 --> 00:14:53,254
Oh, well...

361
00:14:53,256 --> 00:14:56,657
I messing with you. This sundae
just got a cherry on top!

362
00:14:57,994 --> 00:15:00,728
Fine. Good luck to you.

363
00:15:00,730 --> 00:15:02,797
The military is already
interested in my system,

364
00:15:02,799 --> 00:15:04,298
and my math is worked out.

365
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:06,000
His still has a big gap in it.

366
00:15:06,002 --> 00:15:07,334
Where?

367
00:15:08,171 --> 00:15:10,004
There.

368
00:15:13,376 --> 00:15:16,043
- - Can I ask you a question?
Mm?

369
00:15:16,045 --> 00:15:18,679
Does a drug still count
as an antidepressant

370
00:15:18,681 --> 00:15:22,883
if its number one side effect
is uncontrollable weeping?

371
00:15:22,885 --> 00:15:27,488
I don't know. I always feel
better after a good cry.

372
00:15:27,490 --> 00:15:28,989
I've been trying
to ask Bernadette,

373
00:15:28,991 --> 00:15:31,559
but she's not answering
any of my texts.

374
00:15:31,561 --> 00:15:33,661
Yeah, uh, listen,
I think she might be

375
00:15:33,663 --> 00:15:35,496
a little threatened
by you, you know,

376
00:15:35,498 --> 00:15:38,766
because you can tie your own
shoes and laugh without peeing.

377
00:15:38,768 --> 00:15:40,735
Did she say something to you?

378
00:15:40,737 --> 00:15:42,269
No.

379
00:15:42,271 --> 00:15:44,004
I mean, well, kind of.

380
00:15:44,006 --> 00:15:45,506
But it's okay.
She's just hormonal.

381
00:15:45,508 --> 00:15:47,575
And, you know, don't worry,
I stood up for you.

382
00:15:47,577 --> 00:15:50,144
I don't need you
to stand up for me.

383
00:15:50,146 --> 00:15:51,545
You're not my boyfriend.

384
00:15:51,547 --> 00:15:53,681
Look, I care about you,

385
00:15:53,683 --> 00:15:56,383
and you can say that
this doesn't mean anything,

386
00:15:56,385 --> 00:15:58,152
but the truth is we're in
a relationship, okay?

387
00:15:58,154 --> 00:16:00,821
And you're gonna have to figure
out some way to deal with it.

388
00:16:01,891 --> 00:16:05,826
I can't believe
she dumped me.

389
00:16:05,828 --> 00:16:08,395
This is tough for
me, 'cause I can.

390
00:16:13,336 --> 00:16:16,337
Sorry things worked
out like that.

391
00:16:16,339 --> 00:16:19,607
Because I'm in pain or because
you don't have a spy anymore?

392
00:16:19,609 --> 00:16:21,242
Let's just leave
it at "I'm sorry."

393
00:16:21,244 --> 00:16:24,178
You're already sad.

394
00:16:25,348 --> 00:16:27,448
Based on Kripke's
calculations,

395
00:16:27,450 --> 00:16:29,116
I think this
is gonna work.

396
00:16:29,118 --> 00:16:31,051
Maybe we should pitch it
to Colonel Williams today.

397
00:16:31,053 --> 00:16:33,120
Why limit ourselves
to the U.S. military?

398
00:16:33,122 --> 00:16:35,723
I bet there's a lot of
other places we could take this.

399
00:16:35,725 --> 00:16:38,092
Without committing
criminal espionage?

400
00:16:38,094 --> 00:16:40,995
You know, it's easy
to shoot an idea down, Leonard.

401
00:16:42,498 --> 00:16:45,466
Well, I suppose
congratulations are in order.

402
00:16:45,468 --> 00:16:48,469
You set out to destroy me,
and you achieved your goal.

403
00:16:48,471 --> 00:16:49,603
What are you talking about?

404
00:16:49,605 --> 00:16:51,372
The military
canceled my project,

405
00:16:51,374 --> 00:16:53,140
because they're
going with yours.

406
00:16:53,142 --> 00:16:56,443
That's impossible.
We haven't even pitched it yet.

407
00:16:56,445 --> 00:16:58,479
Well, Colonel Williams said
another team at Caltech

408
00:16:58,481 --> 00:17:00,948
came up with a more efficient
neutrino comm system.

409
00:17:00,950 --> 00:17:02,149
Damn it!

410
00:17:03,686 --> 00:17:05,753
Excuse us.

411
00:17:05,755 --> 00:17:07,421
Kripke.

412
00:17:07,423 --> 00:17:09,657
What's up, fellas?

413
00:17:09,659 --> 00:17:10,958
Did you screw us over?

414
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:12,693
Ooh, I can't tell you that.

415
00:17:12,695 --> 00:17:14,528
It's classified.

416
00:17:19,157 --> 00:17:21,690
Why did you tell
Barry Kripke your idea?

417
00:17:21,692 --> 00:17:23,058
This is all your fault.

418
00:17:23,060 --> 00:17:24,293
No, it's your fault.

419
00:17:24,295 --> 00:17:25,961
If you would've come to us
in the beginning,

420
00:17:25,963 --> 00:17:27,463
none of this would've happened.

421
00:17:27,465 --> 00:17:29,265
Well, if it helps,
you all behaved terribly

422
00:17:29,267 --> 00:17:31,200
and you deserve
what you got.

423
00:17:31,202 --> 00:17:33,936
Well, that doesn't help at all.

424
00:17:33,938 --> 00:17:37,173
You know, sometimes your
social skills are very poor.

425
00:17:38,242 --> 00:17:41,944
Can't believe we let
Kripke use us like that.

426
00:17:41,946 --> 00:17:43,979
You know, maybe you're all
more like the guy

427
00:17:43,981 --> 00:17:46,582
who didn't invent
the electric car

428
00:17:46,584 --> 00:17:51,387
and less like the guy
who didn't invent the lightbulb.

429
00:17:54,492 --> 00:17:58,761
She's right. Maybe we're all
a bunch of Teslas after all.

430
00:17:58,763 --> 00:18:02,131
Didn't Tesla die penniless,
forgotten and insane?

431
00:18:02,133 --> 00:18:05,501
You may have a point
about her social skills.

432
00:18:06,437 --> 00:18:07,803
He wasn't insane.

433
00:18:07,805 --> 00:18:10,206
He did fall in love
with a pigeon.

434
00:18:10,208 --> 00:18:11,707
Well, if we're gonna
call Tesla crazy

435
00:18:11,709 --> 00:18:13,475
for loving something
small and unappealing,

436
00:18:13,477 --> 00:18:15,744
might as well put Penny
in a padded cell right now.
