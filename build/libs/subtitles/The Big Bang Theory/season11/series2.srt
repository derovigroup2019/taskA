1
00:00:03,303 --> 00:00:06,771
Uh, One dumpling left.
Who wants it?

2
00:00:06,773 --> 00:00:09,874
Maybe you should offer it
to the pregnant lady.

3
00:00:09,876 --> 00:00:12,577
And that would be...

4
00:00:14,314 --> 00:00:15,814
Me, Sheldon.

5
00:00:15,816 --> 00:00:16,948
I'm obviously pregnant.

6
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:19,084
Well, you never
said it to my face.

7
00:00:19,086 --> 00:00:20,985
And the last time I assumed
a woman was pregnant,

8
00:00:20,987 --> 00:00:23,021
it did not go over well.

9
00:00:23,023 --> 00:00:25,824
Yeah, I'm still mad at you.
(clears throat)

10
00:00:25,826 --> 00:00:28,326
You were drinking water
instead of wine.

11
00:00:28,328 --> 00:00:29,661
What was I supposed
to think?

12
00:00:29,663 --> 00:00:31,596
KOOTHRAPPALI:
Sheldon's right.

13
00:00:31,598 --> 00:00:33,798
I would never ask a woman
if she was pregnant,

14
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:36,835
unless she tells me
or I see a human being

15
00:00:36,837 --> 00:00:38,770
wiggling out of her.

16
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:42,006
Well, Sheldon,
I'm pregnant.

17
00:00:42,008 --> 00:00:44,509
Congratulations.
How far along are you?

18
00:00:44,511 --> 00:00:45,677
About three months.

19
00:00:45,679 --> 00:00:47,846
Only three?

20
00:00:48,915 --> 00:00:52,117
Good gravy, how many
babies are in there?

21
00:00:53,286 --> 00:00:54,719
Okay, let's talk
about something

22
00:00:54,721 --> 00:00:58,490
that won't infuriate
my pregnant wife.

23
00:00:58,492 --> 00:01:00,525
I read an interesting fact
about elephants.

24
00:01:00,527 --> 00:01:03,595
Try again.

25
00:01:03,597 --> 00:01:04,796
Oh, I've got something.

26
00:01:04,798 --> 00:01:07,298
I'm being interviewed
on public radio this Friday.

27
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:08,466
Oh, cool. How come?

28
00:01:08,468 --> 00:01:10,235
Uh, the university is trying
to get more funding

29
00:01:10,237 --> 00:01:11,302
for the physics department,

30
00:01:11,304 --> 00:01:12,937
so they want me to
go out and talk it up.

31
00:01:12,939 --> 00:01:14,773
Really? You?

32
00:01:16,109 --> 00:01:17,876
(whispering indistinctly)

33
00:01:17,878 --> 00:01:21,246
Well, they picked the right
person for the job.

34
00:01:21,248 --> 00:01:22,347
Thank you.

35
00:01:22,349 --> 00:01:24,983
I think he bought it.

36
00:01:26,052 --> 00:01:29,654
? Our whole universe
was in a hot, dense state ?

37
00:01:29,656 --> 00:01:32,991
? Then nearly 14 billion years
ago expansion started... Wait! ?

38
00:01:32,993 --> 00:01:34,626
? The Earth began to cool ?

39
00:01:34,628 --> 00:01:37,162
? The autotrophs began to drool,
Neanderthals developed tools ?

40
00:01:37,164 --> 00:01:39,831
? We built the Wall ?
? <i>We built the pyramids</i> ?

41
00:01:39,833 --> 00:01:42,500
? Math, Science, History,
unraveling the mystery ?

42
00:01:42,502 --> 00:01:44,402
? That all started
with a big bang ?

43
00:01:44,404 --> 00:01:45,394
? <i>Bang!</i> ?

44
00:01:45,395 --> 00:01:49,395

46
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:57,954
Hi, I'm Ira Flatow,
and this is <i>Science Friday.</i>

47
00:01:57,956 --> 00:01:59,256
Joining me today

48
00:01:59,258 --> 00:02:00,891
is my guest physicist,
Dr. Leonard Hofstadter,

49
00:02:00,893 --> 00:02:02,492
to talk about

50
00:02:02,494 --> 00:02:05,562
all of the exciting research
they're doing at Cal Tech.

51
00:02:05,564 --> 00:02:08,031
Thank you for having me.
Whoa... (chuckles)

52
00:02:08,033 --> 00:02:10,267
Could never get used to
hearing myself in headphones.

53
00:02:10,269 --> 00:02:11,501
Is that really how I sound?

54
00:02:11,503 --> 00:02:14,037
(chuckles)
It is. It is.

55
00:02:14,039 --> 00:02:17,107
(deep voice):
That is good to know.

56
00:02:17,109 --> 00:02:19,042
I told him his voice
was annoying.

57
00:02:19,044 --> 00:02:21,111
He didn't want to listen.

58
00:02:21,113 --> 00:02:22,245
Hey...

59
00:02:22,247 --> 00:02:23,980
You're saying it's not?

60
00:02:23,982 --> 00:02:26,750
Just... hey.

61
00:02:26,752 --> 00:02:29,219
FLATOW:
So, it has been five years

62
00:02:29,221 --> 00:02:31,221
since the discovery
of the Higgs boson--

63
00:02:31,223 --> 00:02:33,557
what's the next big thing
gonna be?

64
00:02:33,559 --> 00:02:35,025
Wow, that's hard to say.

65
00:02:35,027 --> 00:02:36,226
There's so much going on.

66
00:02:36,228 --> 00:02:37,928
We've been collecting
tons of data

67
00:02:37,930 --> 00:02:40,797
that could revolutionize the way
we understand the universe.

68
00:02:40,799 --> 00:02:43,400
For instance, there's a particle
called a squark,

69
00:02:43,402 --> 00:02:45,368
which could prove supersymmetry.

70
00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:47,203
That is interesting.
Have you found it?

71
00:02:47,205 --> 00:02:48,672
- What, the squark?
- Yes.

72
00:02:48,674 --> 00:02:50,674
No, no.

73
00:02:51,410 --> 00:02:53,843
Wouldn't that be exciting?

74
00:02:53,845 --> 00:02:56,079
But we're also looking
for the selectron,

75
00:02:56,081 --> 00:02:57,514
the gluino and the neutralino.

76
00:02:57,516 --> 00:03:00,417
- Well, and have you found that?
- No.

77
00:03:00,419 --> 00:03:02,085
LEONARD:
Another fun sidenote--

78
00:03:02,087 --> 00:03:05,221
I went to high school with
a girl named Theresa Gluino,

79
00:03:05,223 --> 00:03:07,924
but it didn't cost $2 billion
to find her.

80
00:03:07,926 --> 00:03:10,727
She was smoking behind the gym.
(laughs)

81
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:13,663
So, what have you found?

82
00:03:13,665 --> 00:03:14,998
Uh, nothing, actually.

83
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,600
Should he be saying that?

84
00:03:16,602 --> 00:03:18,735
Uh, probably not.

85
00:03:18,737 --> 00:03:20,303
Yeah, this is public radio.

86
00:03:20,305 --> 00:03:23,473
Doesn't he realize that dozens
of people might hear him?

87
00:03:25,010 --> 00:03:27,010
But I remain confident.

88
00:03:27,012 --> 00:03:29,379
We've got the best equipment
and the best minds

89
00:03:29,381 --> 00:03:30,680
all working on it.

90
00:03:30,682 --> 00:03:32,716
Okay, sounds like
he's back on track.

91
00:03:32,718 --> 00:03:34,084
LEONARD:
Although, some days

92
00:03:34,086 --> 00:03:35,418
I'm, like, ugh...

93
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:37,053
we've spent so much <i>money.</i>

94
00:03:37,055 --> 00:03:40,890
Why haven't we found <i>anything?</i>
What are we <i>doing?</i>

95
00:03:43,395 --> 00:03:45,695
Oh, boy.

96
00:03:49,001 --> 00:03:50,834
There's Leonard.

97
00:03:50,836 --> 00:03:53,236
I'll bet he's having
a rough day. (chuckles)

98
00:03:53,238 --> 00:03:54,571
Let's just try to be supportive.

99
00:03:54,573 --> 00:03:55,939
Supportive?

100
00:03:55,941 --> 00:03:58,008
He publicly maligned
the love of my life,

101
00:03:58,010 --> 00:04:00,310
Lady Physics.

102
00:04:00,312 --> 00:04:03,780
You might not want to
mention that to Lady Fianc?e.

103
00:04:03,782 --> 00:04:05,715
Hey, guys.

104
00:04:05,717 --> 00:04:07,384
KOOTHRAPPALI:
Hey, how's it going?

105
00:04:07,386 --> 00:04:10,020
(scoffs)

106
00:04:10,022 --> 00:04:12,555
What?
You got something to say?

107
00:04:12,557 --> 00:04:15,892
I think I just said it.

108
00:04:15,894 --> 00:04:17,827
P-F-F.

109
00:04:18,730 --> 00:04:20,497
Pff!

110
00:04:23,001 --> 00:04:25,135
Look, I-I was just
speaking the truth.

111
00:04:25,137 --> 00:04:27,704
We're scientists-- isn't that
what we're supposed to do?

112
00:04:27,706 --> 00:04:29,139
Oh, what would you know
about the truth?

113
00:04:29,141 --> 00:04:32,676
You thought <i>Phantom Menace</i>
was "not half bad."

114
00:04:33,679 --> 00:04:35,979
I told you that in confidence!

115
00:04:35,981 --> 00:04:40,083
Okay, calm down.
Everybody just cool it.

116
00:04:40,085 --> 00:04:41,217
No, let 'em go.
If we get lucky,

117
00:04:41,219 --> 00:04:43,219
maybe one of them
will start crying.

118
00:04:43,221 --> 00:04:47,223
Uh, can we just drop this
and have lunch like adults?

119
00:04:47,225 --> 00:04:49,559
- Fine.
- Very well.

120
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:52,796
- Leonard?
- What?

121
00:04:52,798 --> 00:04:54,964
Pff!

122
00:04:56,134 --> 00:04:57,867
(knock on door)

123
00:04:57,869 --> 00:04:59,302
You ready for lunch?

124
00:04:59,304 --> 00:05:01,237
Oh, one second.

125
00:05:01,239 --> 00:05:04,174
Ooh, someone's got a lot
of fancy new lab equipment.

126
00:05:04,176 --> 00:05:07,577
I know. The university has been
throwing money at my study.

127
00:05:07,579 --> 00:05:09,212
With any luck,
there'll be a brain disease

128
00:05:09,214 --> 00:05:10,613
with my name on it.

129
00:05:10,615 --> 00:05:12,615
Fingers crossed.

130
00:05:12,617 --> 00:05:15,685
Which is ironic, because
if you had Fowler's palsy,

131
00:05:15,687 --> 00:05:17,554
you wouldn't be able
to cross your fingers.

132
00:05:19,591 --> 00:05:21,291
I'm surprised Sheldon's
not up here playing

133
00:05:21,293 --> 00:05:22,659
with all your new toys.

134
00:05:22,661 --> 00:05:24,561
Actually, I haven't
told him about it.

135
00:05:24,563 --> 00:05:26,763
We've been getting so much
more funding than physics,

136
00:05:26,765 --> 00:05:28,264
he's been a little sensitive.

137
00:05:28,266 --> 00:05:30,834
So you're just gonna hide
your success from him?

138
00:05:30,836 --> 00:05:32,168
I know.

139
00:05:32,170 --> 00:05:34,437
- Am I terrible?
- No.

140
00:05:34,439 --> 00:05:36,439
I do that, too.

141
00:05:37,476 --> 00:05:40,210
How he thought my company
retreat was in Boise?

142
00:05:40,212 --> 00:05:43,279
It was in Tahiti.

143
00:05:43,281 --> 00:05:44,981
That's such a relief.

144
00:05:44,983 --> 00:05:47,517
I mean, part of me was worried
I was being unfair to Sheldon.

145
00:05:47,519 --> 00:05:49,819
Take that part of yourself
and hide it away.

146
00:05:49,821 --> 00:05:51,821
Just like I did with
last year's bonus check

147
00:05:51,823 --> 00:05:53,356
that I "didn't get."

148
00:05:56,595 --> 00:05:58,361
(knock on door)

149
00:05:58,363 --> 00:05:59,896
Ms. Davis, you
wanted to see me?

150
00:05:59,898 --> 00:06:02,365
Yes, Dr. Hofstadter,
come on in.

151
00:06:02,367 --> 00:06:04,534
Should I sit or stand?

152
00:06:04,536 --> 00:06:06,669
I'm not used to being called
into the dean's office.

153
00:06:06,671 --> 00:06:08,271
Please, sit.

154
00:06:08,273 --> 00:06:10,940
I have to say
I'm a little nervous.

155
00:06:10,942 --> 00:06:12,675
You should be.

156
00:06:14,346 --> 00:06:15,712
Look, I know I screwed up,

157
00:06:15,714 --> 00:06:17,747
but it was only one interview.

158
00:06:17,749 --> 00:06:19,816
How much damage
could it have caused?

159
00:06:19,818 --> 00:06:21,918
Would you like for me
to read you the e-mails

160
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:24,587
from donors asking
why are they giving us money

161
00:06:24,589 --> 00:06:26,156
if physics is a dead end?

162
00:06:26,158 --> 00:06:28,191
I didn't say it
was a dead end.

163
00:06:28,193 --> 00:06:30,093
I just said that I was
worried it might be.

164
00:06:30,095 --> 00:06:32,762
So if I just said
I was worried

165
00:06:32,764 --> 00:06:34,564
you might not
have a job next week,

166
00:06:34,566 --> 00:06:37,100
how would you feel?

167
00:06:38,136 --> 00:06:40,970
Light-headed, and glad
you asked me to sit down.

168
00:06:40,972 --> 00:06:43,473
Okay, just tell me
what I can do.

169
00:06:43,475 --> 00:06:45,208
I'm gonna need you
to make a statement

170
00:06:45,210 --> 00:06:47,844
saying that you misspoke,
and that you're confident

171
00:06:47,846 --> 00:06:50,713
the physics community is
close to a major breakthrough.

172
00:06:50,715 --> 00:06:52,849
You want me to lie.

173
00:06:52,851 --> 00:06:57,353
Look, Dr. Hofstadter,
I'm counting on you.

174
00:06:57,355 --> 00:06:59,756
I think that you are
the smartest physicist

175
00:06:59,758 --> 00:07:01,591
at this university.

176
00:07:01,593 --> 00:07:03,226
Really?

177
00:07:03,228 --> 00:07:06,362
See? Lies.
They're not that hard.

178
00:07:10,368 --> 00:07:12,035
(door opens)

179
00:07:12,037 --> 00:07:15,171
- Hi.
- Hello.

180
00:07:15,173 --> 00:07:17,907
Huh. Looks like
you've been busy.

181
00:07:17,909 --> 00:07:19,509
Oh, I have.

182
00:07:19,511 --> 00:07:22,412
Uh, dark matter,
uh, reconciling gravity

183
00:07:22,414 --> 00:07:23,613
and quantum mechanics.

184
00:07:23,615 --> 00:07:24,948
Supersymmetry.

185
00:07:24,950 --> 00:07:28,017
I've figured out the biggest
problems in physics today.

186
00:07:28,019 --> 00:07:30,220
Wow, you solved them all?

187
00:07:30,222 --> 00:07:34,023
No, I just, I figured out that
they're the biggest problems.

188
00:07:35,227 --> 00:07:37,727
Is this about what
Leonard said on the radio?

189
00:07:37,729 --> 00:07:39,295
Absolutely not.

190
00:07:39,297 --> 00:07:41,197
And I do not want
to talk about Leonard.

191
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:43,032
Can we please just talk
about anything else?

192
00:07:43,034 --> 00:07:44,801
We could talk about my day.

193
00:07:44,803 --> 00:07:47,604
Walked right into
that one, didn't I?

194
00:07:47,606 --> 00:07:50,840
Well, since you sort of asked,

195
00:07:50,842 --> 00:07:52,242
I actually had a very good day.

196
00:07:52,244 --> 00:07:54,244
Got some new equipment
for my lab.

197
00:07:55,881 --> 00:07:58,047
Well, congratulations.

198
00:07:58,049 --> 00:08:00,783
I got some new equipment, too.

199
00:08:00,785 --> 00:08:04,120
I got these markers.

200
00:08:04,122 --> 00:08:05,488
They smell like fruit.

201
00:08:05,490 --> 00:08:06,456
Which I did not notice

202
00:08:06,458 --> 00:08:08,424
when I bought them.
(sniffs)

203
00:08:08,426 --> 00:08:09,792
Don't really care for it.

204
00:08:12,297 --> 00:08:14,530
Here, drink this.

205
00:08:14,532 --> 00:08:16,432
It might help.

206
00:08:16,434 --> 00:08:17,667
What if it doesn't?

207
00:08:17,669 --> 00:08:20,803
Well, that's why
I brought the bottle.

208
00:08:21,907 --> 00:08:23,640
No one would talk
to me in the halls.

209
00:08:23,642 --> 00:08:25,308
They just glared at me.

210
00:08:25,310 --> 00:08:27,577
It's like high school
all over again.

211
00:08:27,579 --> 00:08:31,047
Oh, I would totally do
high school all over again.

212
00:08:33,285 --> 00:08:35,652
But that doesn't help you.
No.

213
00:08:37,088 --> 00:08:40,156
I got called in
to the administration office.

214
00:08:40,158 --> 00:08:43,993
Ooh, look at my bad boy
getting called to the principal.

215
00:08:43,995 --> 00:08:45,929
We don't technically
have a principal.

216
00:08:45,931 --> 00:08:48,264
There's a standing committee
that oversees the budget.

217
00:08:48,266 --> 00:08:50,566
Ooh, look at my bad boy
answering questions

218
00:08:50,568 --> 00:08:52,402
nobody asked.

219
00:08:52,404 --> 00:08:54,637
Hey, come on, look,
you said a few dumb things

220
00:08:54,639 --> 00:08:57,040
on the radio-- what is
the worst that could happen?

221
00:08:57,042 --> 00:09:00,176
I may get fired.

222
00:09:00,178 --> 00:09:03,179
Okay, well, even if you did,
you could find another job.

223
00:09:03,181 --> 00:09:05,815
Yeah, who wouldn't want
to hire the physicist

224
00:09:05,817 --> 00:09:07,984
who publicly said
physics is dead?

225
00:09:07,986 --> 00:09:12,021
Well, I wouldn't put that
under "special skills."

226
00:09:12,023 --> 00:09:15,158
I can fix it, I just need
to write a retraction

227
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:18,328
I don't believe in-- basically
sell out to keep my job.

228
00:09:18,330 --> 00:09:20,229
Great, I'll leave you to it.

229
00:09:24,336 --> 00:09:26,536
Hmm.

230
00:09:33,078 --> 00:09:35,278
Hmm.

231
00:09:40,452 --> 00:09:43,086
Oy.

232
00:09:43,088 --> 00:09:44,253
(knocking on door)

233
00:09:44,255 --> 00:09:46,456
LEONARD:
Sheldon, it's me.

234
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:50,226
What?

235
00:09:50,228 --> 00:09:52,061
Look, I know you're mad,
but I have to write a statement

236
00:09:52,063 --> 00:09:54,497
that says the physics community
is close to a breakthrough,

237
00:09:54,499 --> 00:09:55,898
and since you actually
believe that,

238
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:57,700
I could really use your help.

239
00:09:57,702 --> 00:09:58,968
Sorry, I can't.

240
00:09:58,970 --> 00:10:00,570
Come on, don't be like that.

241
00:10:00,572 --> 00:10:03,006
I can't, because I think
you were right.

242
00:10:03,008 --> 00:10:04,574
What?

243
00:10:04,576 --> 00:10:06,275
Look.
(sighs)

244
00:10:06,277 --> 00:10:08,144
Not all science pans out.

245
00:10:08,146 --> 00:10:09,579
You know, we've
been hoping

246
00:10:09,581 --> 00:10:11,514
supersymmetry
was true for decades,

247
00:10:11,516 --> 00:10:14,250
and finally, we built
the Large Hadron Collider,

248
00:10:14,252 --> 00:10:16,886
which is supposed to prove it
by finding these new particles,

249
00:10:16,888 --> 00:10:18,121
and it-it hasn't.

250
00:10:18,123 --> 00:10:19,622
And maybe
supersymmetry,

251
00:10:19,624 --> 00:10:21,991
our last big idea,
is simply wrong.

252
00:10:23,428 --> 00:10:26,396
Well, that sounds awful.

253
00:10:26,398 --> 00:10:29,665
Now I get why everyone hates me.

254
00:10:29,667 --> 00:10:31,100
Well, on the bright side,

255
00:10:31,102 --> 00:10:33,002
after working together
for 15 years,

256
00:10:33,004 --> 00:10:36,005
you finally get to hear me say,
"You were right."

257
00:10:38,176 --> 00:10:41,144
Oh, yeah, you did.

258
00:10:41,146 --> 00:10:42,178
How's it feel?

259
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:43,980
Mm, given I might be unemployed,

260
00:10:43,982 --> 00:10:45,515
bittersweet.

261
00:10:54,934 --> 00:10:56,968
Read it back to me?
Oh, hang on.

262
00:10:56,970 --> 00:11:00,071
"Yes, one might question
the $20 billion

263
00:11:00,073 --> 00:11:02,139
"to build and run
the Large Hadron Collider,

264
00:11:02,141 --> 00:11:04,475
but on the other hand..."

265
00:11:09,148 --> 00:11:11,115
Okay. Um...

266
00:11:11,117 --> 00:11:13,918
Oh, oh! "On the other hand,
contrary to predictions,

267
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:17,555
"the collider didn't create
a small black hole

268
00:11:17,557 --> 00:11:19,623
"that devoured the Earth
and life as we know it.

269
00:11:19,625 --> 00:11:23,127
So, s-- money well spent."

270
00:11:24,964 --> 00:11:26,764
This is depressing.

271
00:11:26,766 --> 00:11:28,733
Do you have any alcohol
around here?

272
00:11:28,735 --> 00:11:30,901
Uh, not surprisingly,
when Penny moved out,

273
00:11:30,903 --> 00:11:33,170
she took every last drop. Um...

274
00:11:33,172 --> 00:11:36,407
Oh, but I do have several
bottles of Romulan ale

275
00:11:36,409 --> 00:11:39,677
that I bought at Comic-Con.

276
00:11:39,679 --> 00:11:43,447
Isn't that just vodka
with blue dye in it?

277
00:11:43,449 --> 00:11:45,416
You-- first, physics,
now Romulan ale.

278
00:11:45,418 --> 00:11:47,685
What else would you like
to defecate on?

279
00:11:49,255 --> 00:11:50,955
Hey. I thought you
were coming right back.

280
00:11:50,957 --> 00:11:52,056
I was,

281
00:11:52,058 --> 00:11:53,691
but we're both depressed,
and decided

282
00:11:53,693 --> 00:11:55,226
to drown our sorrows.

283
00:11:56,329 --> 00:11:57,995
In mouthwash?

284
00:11:59,665 --> 00:12:03,234
Man, that is so summer camp.

285
00:12:03,236 --> 00:12:06,303
I-It's Romulan ale,
from <i>Star Trek.</i>

286
00:12:06,305 --> 00:12:08,172
It was briefly legalized
during the alliance

287
00:12:08,174 --> 00:12:10,174
between the Romulan Empire
and the Federation

288
00:12:10,176 --> 00:12:12,043
at the time of the Dominion War.

289
00:12:12,045 --> 00:12:14,845
Aw, now <i>I'm</i> depressed.

290
00:12:17,116 --> 00:12:19,984
The more I told him about
my lab, the pissier he got.

291
00:12:19,986 --> 00:12:21,519
You know what
he said to me?

292
00:12:21,521 --> 00:12:23,287
He said, "I hope
all your correlations

293
00:12:23,289 --> 00:12:26,791
turn out to be specious."

294
00:12:26,793 --> 00:12:28,959
He said that to your face?

295
00:12:28,961 --> 00:12:30,461
What a dick.

296
00:12:33,599 --> 00:12:35,566
You know,
you're a successful woman.

297
00:12:35,568 --> 00:12:37,568
You should be able to brag
about your accomplishments

298
00:12:37,570 --> 00:12:38,702
once in a while.

299
00:12:38,704 --> 00:12:40,171
Well, so should you.

300
00:12:40,173 --> 00:12:42,173
I mean, the guys
are never shy about bragging.

301
00:12:42,175 --> 00:12:44,141
Tell me about it.
Howie texts me

302
00:12:44,143 --> 00:12:47,411
every time his dog levels up
in <i>Warcraft.</i>

303
00:12:47,413 --> 00:12:49,380
Has he ever called you

304
00:12:49,382 --> 00:12:51,549
to tell you he found three
peanuts in one shell?

305
00:12:51,551 --> 00:12:54,318
'Cause Sheldon has.

306
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:56,654
We should be able
to do that, too.

307
00:12:56,656 --> 00:12:59,223
I guess we can
brag to each other.

308
00:12:59,225 --> 00:13:00,991
That's a great idea.

309
00:13:00,993 --> 00:13:03,561
Damn right it is;
I came up with it.

310
00:13:03,563 --> 00:13:06,063
(chuckles)

311
00:13:06,065 --> 00:13:07,998
That felt good.

312
00:13:11,204 --> 00:13:13,304
You know, there's so much money
in pharmaceuticals,

313
00:13:13,306 --> 00:13:15,473
we don't even wash out
our test tubes.

314
00:13:15,475 --> 00:13:18,676
We just throw them out
and get new ones.

315
00:13:18,678 --> 00:13:22,913
I just got a brand-new,
state of the art fMRI machine.

316
00:13:22,915 --> 00:13:24,415
Whoa. Those things
are so expensive.

317
00:13:24,417 --> 00:13:25,716
I know.

318
00:13:25,718 --> 00:13:29,053
Sometimes, I just lie down
in there and take a nap.

319
00:13:29,055 --> 00:13:30,855
Oh.

320
00:13:30,857 --> 00:13:34,525
It's like a million
dollar bunk bed.

321
00:13:34,527 --> 00:13:36,961
At the office,
I have two assistants.

322
00:13:36,963 --> 00:13:38,095
I don't even
know their names,

323
00:13:38,097 --> 00:13:41,098
I just call them
Thing One and Thing Two.

324
00:13:42,268 --> 00:13:44,335
That's great. I-I
don't have assistants.

325
00:13:44,337 --> 00:13:46,337
Oh. I guess that's one of
the benefits

326
00:13:46,339 --> 00:13:48,239
of being in the private sector.

327
00:13:48,241 --> 00:13:50,407
That and all the money I make.

328
00:13:50,409 --> 00:13:53,210
Yeah, you've got that.

329
00:13:53,212 --> 00:13:54,645
I've got my integrity.

330
00:13:54,647 --> 00:13:57,681
Hard to say which is better
without making you feel bad.

331
00:14:00,453 --> 00:14:02,186
Okay. So you guys are upset

332
00:14:02,188 --> 00:14:05,356
because the collider thing
disproved your theories?

333
00:14:05,358 --> 00:14:07,024
I-It's worse than that.

334
00:14:07,026 --> 00:14:09,160
It hasn't found anything
in years, so we don't know

335
00:14:09,162 --> 00:14:10,694
if we're right,
we don't know if we're wrong.

336
00:14:10,696 --> 00:14:12,396
We don't know where to go next.

337
00:14:12,398 --> 00:14:17,635
All I know is it looks like
I tongue-kissed <i>Avatar.</i>

338
00:14:17,637 --> 00:14:18,836
PENNY:
Come on.

339
00:14:18,838 --> 00:14:20,371
You guys are physicists.

340
00:14:20,373 --> 00:14:22,506
Okay? You're always
gonna be physicists.

341
00:14:22,508 --> 00:14:25,209
And sure, sometimes,
the physics is hard,

342
00:14:25,211 --> 00:14:29,647
but isn't that
what makes it boring?

343
00:14:30,850 --> 00:14:32,183
- Hey.
- We're here.

344
00:14:32,185 --> 00:14:33,384
What's going on?

345
00:14:33,386 --> 00:14:35,920
Okay. As far as I can see,
science is dead,

346
00:14:35,922 --> 00:14:37,221
'cause Leonard killed it.

347
00:14:37,223 --> 00:14:38,389
And, uh,

348
00:14:38,391 --> 00:14:39,823
I don't know
who the Romulans are,

349
00:14:39,825 --> 00:14:42,193
but those guys
know how to party.

350
00:14:42,195 --> 00:14:44,094
So, what do you
want us to do?

351
00:14:44,096 --> 00:14:45,896
I don't know. You're scientists;
cheer them up.

352
00:14:45,898 --> 00:14:47,364
"Cheer them up"?

353
00:14:47,366 --> 00:14:49,700
Do you even know
what a scientist is?

354
00:14:50,937 --> 00:14:52,836
No, we don't need
to be cheered up.

355
00:14:52,838 --> 00:14:55,639
It just turns out that physics
is exactly like <i>Lost.</i>

356
00:14:55,641 --> 00:14:59,877
Started out great, and turns out
just a big old waste of time.

357
00:14:59,879 --> 00:15:02,012
Boo-hoo. You know
what you sound like?

358
00:15:02,014 --> 00:15:03,147
Babies.

359
00:15:03,149 --> 00:15:05,349
Two whiny babies.

360
00:15:05,351 --> 00:15:06,550
And there's nothing
worse than being stuck

361
00:15:06,552 --> 00:15:10,221
with two whiny babies!

362
00:15:10,223 --> 00:15:12,890
Oh.

363
00:15:24,036 --> 00:15:27,304
Oh, my God, I'm gonna
have two babies.

364
00:15:27,306 --> 00:15:28,806
No, no, no, no.
Babies are great.

365
00:15:28,808 --> 00:15:30,407
You're lucky to
have two babies.

366
00:15:30,409 --> 00:15:31,875
I mean, look at me,
uh, I'm all alone.

367
00:15:31,877 --> 00:15:33,377
I'm never gonna have babies,

368
00:15:33,379 --> 00:15:37,748
'cause you can't make a baby
watching Netflix with your dog.

369
00:15:42,655 --> 00:15:45,322
Thanks for coming.

370
00:15:47,593 --> 00:15:49,460
I may not make as
much money as you,

371
00:15:49,462 --> 00:15:50,995
but at least I know that
I'm actually doing something

372
00:15:50,997 --> 00:15:52,963
that makes people's
lives better.

373
00:15:52,965 --> 00:15:55,733
Hey, my work makes
people's lives better.

374
00:15:55,735 --> 00:15:58,502
Especially if you have
moderate to severe eczema

375
00:15:58,504 --> 00:16:00,971
and don't mind
if you lose teeth.

376
00:16:00,973 --> 00:16:03,173
You're right.

377
00:16:03,175 --> 00:16:05,009
We both do important work.

378
00:16:05,011 --> 00:16:06,877
I'm trying to map the
structures of the brain,

379
00:16:06,879 --> 00:16:08,212
and you're trying
to convince people

380
00:16:08,214 --> 00:16:11,448
that itchy hair
is a real thing.

381
00:16:11,450 --> 00:16:13,417
It is a real thing.

382
00:16:13,419 --> 00:16:18,522
It happens to be a side effect
of our cholesterol drug.

383
00:16:18,524 --> 00:16:20,624
I'm just saying
that my research

384
00:16:20,626 --> 00:16:23,661
may actually change
the world forever.

385
00:16:23,663 --> 00:16:25,029
I hope it does.

386
00:16:25,031 --> 00:16:27,197
'Cause I'm gonna see
that world from a yacht so big,

387
00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:30,434
you can land
a helicopter on it.

388
00:16:33,105 --> 00:16:35,839
(drink pouring)

389
00:16:35,841 --> 00:16:38,042
Physics is all
we're cut out for.

390
00:16:38,044 --> 00:16:41,912
I mean, if we weren't
physicists, w-what would we be?

391
00:16:41,914 --> 00:16:44,515
I don't know. Popular?
(chuckles)

392
00:16:44,517 --> 00:16:46,417
Mm-hmm.

393
00:16:46,419 --> 00:16:49,553
It's fine. I don't need
to be a theoretical physicist.

394
00:16:49,555 --> 00:16:52,122
There's lots of things
I could use this brain for.

395
00:16:52,124 --> 00:16:56,060
I could be an accountant
for the mob.

396
00:16:57,229 --> 00:17:01,131
I could guess
people's weight at the fair.

397
00:17:01,133 --> 00:17:03,534
Okay. This is getting silly.

398
00:17:03,536 --> 00:17:05,002
Is it?

399
00:17:05,004 --> 00:17:06,503
180.

400
00:17:09,175 --> 00:17:10,741
Okay.

401
00:17:10,743 --> 00:17:11,909
That is enough.

402
00:17:11,911 --> 00:17:13,577
Your lives are not wasted.

403
00:17:13,579 --> 00:17:15,779
Your careers are not
at a dead end.

404
00:17:15,781 --> 00:17:17,147
You just hit a
rough patch.

405
00:17:17,149 --> 00:17:18,716
Instead of feeling sorry
for yourselves,

406
00:17:18,718 --> 00:17:20,451
you need to get up
and get inspired.

407
00:17:20,453 --> 00:17:21,685
How?

408
00:17:21,687 --> 00:17:23,253
I don't know.
You know, when I'm feeling down,

409
00:17:23,255 --> 00:17:27,591
I go for a run, which is exactly
why I'm not 180 pounds, genius!

410
00:17:29,462 --> 00:17:31,395
I know where we need to go.

411
00:17:31,397 --> 00:17:32,730
Mm. Are we running there?
Because watching

412
00:17:32,732 --> 00:17:36,100
drunk Sheldon run would be
the highlight of my life.

413
00:17:36,102 --> 00:17:37,634
WOLOWITZ:
We're going to see

414
00:17:37,636 --> 00:17:38,869
Richard Feynman.

415
00:17:38,871 --> 00:17:41,605
Penny, Richard Feynman
is an iconic phys...

416
00:17:41,607 --> 00:17:43,407
I know who he is.
Leonard dressed as him

417
00:17:43,409 --> 00:17:45,209
for Halloween last year.

418
00:17:48,447 --> 00:17:51,882
PENNY: I had no idea
Richard Feynman was dead.

419
00:17:51,884 --> 00:17:55,352
Yep. Most people don't know
he's actually buried right here

420
00:17:55,354 --> 00:17:57,054
in Altadena.

421
00:17:57,056 --> 00:18:01,125
I'm sure they keep a lid on that
to avoid traffic jams.

422
00:18:02,395 --> 00:18:03,627
Well.
(chuckles)

423
00:18:03,629 --> 00:18:05,262
Here he is.

424
00:18:05,264 --> 00:18:07,598
Oh, wow.
He's buried with his wife.

425
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:09,333
We get it. A lady loved you.

426
00:18:09,335 --> 00:18:11,769
Quit bragging.

427
00:18:11,771 --> 00:18:14,638
Feynman was so cool.

428
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:17,040
When I was a kid, I'd
put on some headphones

429
00:18:17,042 --> 00:18:20,144
and crank up one of
his lectures and just...

430
00:18:20,146 --> 00:18:22,513
jam out to knowledge.

431
00:18:24,216 --> 00:18:25,516
This guy knew how to live.

432
00:18:25,518 --> 00:18:28,085
He taught himself
musical instruments.

433
00:18:28,087 --> 00:18:29,887
He studied Portuguese.

434
00:18:29,889 --> 00:18:32,055
Just to give a speech
in Brazil.

435
00:18:32,057 --> 00:18:35,959
The only part of me that's been
to Brazil is my bikini line.

436
00:18:35,961 --> 00:18:37,995
Okay.

437
00:18:39,999 --> 00:18:41,799
He did so much.

438
00:18:41,801 --> 00:18:45,102
And here we are, stuck
and letting him down.

439
00:18:45,104 --> 00:18:48,372
You know, Feynman used to
say he didn't do physics

440
00:18:48,374 --> 00:18:53,076
for the glory or the awards,
but just for the fun of it.

441
00:18:53,078 --> 00:18:55,879
He was right.

442
00:18:55,881 --> 00:18:59,683
Physics is only dead when we
stop being excited about it.

443
00:19:00,853 --> 00:19:03,987
Even beyond the grave,
he's imparting wisdom.

444
00:19:03,989 --> 00:19:07,124
Um, I'm the one
who remembered it.

445
00:19:08,127 --> 00:19:09,560
Give me the bottle.

446
00:19:09,562 --> 00:19:11,495
I mean, it might be
a little corny, but I say

447
00:19:11,497 --> 00:19:14,331
we pour one out
for all the science homies

448
00:19:14,333 --> 00:19:15,899
who came before us.

449
00:19:15,901 --> 00:19:17,668
I love that.
(Wolowitz chuckles)

450
00:19:18,904 --> 00:19:20,304
Mm-hmm.

451
00:19:20,306 --> 00:19:21,638
(chuckles softly)

452
00:19:22,575 --> 00:19:24,842
(gags)
Here comes some more.

453
00:19:27,070 --> 00:19:29,313
(Sheldon retching)

454
00:19:29,315 --> 00:19:31,648
Ah, we got to see him run.

455
00:19:40,622 --> 00:19:43,122
(knocks on door)
Oh, hi, you wanted to see me?

456
00:19:43,124 --> 00:19:45,291
Yes. I wanted to talk to you
about the e-mail

457
00:19:45,293 --> 00:19:46,592
you sent me last night.

458
00:19:46,594 --> 00:19:49,729
I sent you an e-mail?

459
00:19:49,731 --> 00:19:52,865
You bet you did.

460
00:19:52,867 --> 00:19:54,901
"Hello.

461
00:19:54,903 --> 00:19:58,738
Shalom and aloha from the grave
of Richard Feynman."

462
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:01,340
(groans):
Oh, it's coming back to me.

463
00:20:01,342 --> 00:20:03,910
"Please accept
the following retraction:

464
00:20:03,912 --> 00:20:06,045
"I know I said physics is dead,

465
00:20:06,047 --> 00:20:07,914
"but it is the opposite of dead.

466
00:20:07,916 --> 00:20:09,081
"If anything,

467
00:20:09,083 --> 00:20:11,784
"it is undead, like a zombie.

468
00:20:11,786 --> 00:20:13,953
"Speaking of which,

469
00:20:13,955 --> 00:20:15,988
"if Richard Feynman
came back as a zombie,

470
00:20:15,990 --> 00:20:19,725
I would totally
let him bite me."

471
00:20:20,595 --> 00:20:22,595
Any chance that's the end?

472
00:20:23,431 --> 00:20:25,598
"I got bit by a squirrel once.

473
00:20:26,701 --> 00:20:28,835
"I had to get rabies shots.

"I cried so much,
