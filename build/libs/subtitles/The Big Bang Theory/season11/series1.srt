<i>Previously on</i>
The Big Bang Theory...

2
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:06,071
I was offered a summer research
fellowship at Princeton.

3
00:00:06,073 --> 00:00:09,140
A fine institution.

4
00:00:09,142 --> 00:00:11,242
The place where
Albert Einstein taught,

5
00:00:11,244 --> 00:00:13,345
and where Leonard got his PhD,

6
00:00:13,347 --> 00:00:15,814
so it may have gone downhill.

7
00:00:15,816 --> 00:00:18,383
Gentlemen, you may
remember Dr. Nowitzki.

8
00:00:18,385 --> 00:00:20,785
She's back at Caltech
for her postdoc.

9
00:00:20,787 --> 00:00:22,087
- Hello.
- Hi.

10
00:00:23,557 --> 00:00:27,125
are you seeking a romantic
relationship with me?

11
00:00:27,127 --> 00:00:28,727
What if I were?

12
00:00:28,729 --> 00:00:32,197
Well, that would raise
a number of problems.

13
00:00:32,199 --> 00:00:34,933
We're colleagues, I'm
currently in a relation...

14
00:00:39,506 --> 00:00:41,673
Amy? Amy.

15
00:00:41,675 --> 00:00:43,541
Amy?

16
00:00:56,757 --> 00:00:57,956
Will you marry me?

17
00:01:01,294 --> 00:01:03,928
One moment, please.

18
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:06,331
Really, you're going to
answer that right now?

19
00:01:06,333 --> 00:01:07,532
It's Leonard.

20
00:01:07,534 --> 00:01:10,068
I don't want to be rude.

21
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:10,835
Hello?

22
00:01:10,837 --> 00:01:11,870
Oh, hey, where you been?

23
00:01:11,872 --> 00:01:13,204
We've been calling you
for hours.

24
00:01:13,206 --> 00:01:16,141
Oh, I'm sorry, my phone was
on "airplane" mode.

25
00:01:16,143 --> 00:01:17,108
Why?

26
00:01:17,110 --> 00:01:21,112
Because I was on an airplane.

27
00:01:21,114 --> 00:01:22,580
Hey, put him on speaker.

28
00:01:22,582 --> 00:01:24,349
- Yeah.
- Hey, where are you?

29
00:01:24,351 --> 00:01:26,951
I came to Princeton
to see Amy.

30
00:01:26,953 --> 00:01:28,553
It's a funny
story, actually.

31
00:01:28,555 --> 00:01:31,189
I was having lunch
with Dr. Nowitzki,

32
00:01:31,191 --> 00:01:32,557
and she kissed me.

33
00:01:32,559 --> 00:01:33,658
- Excuse me?
- What?

34
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:34,859
I'm sorry?

35
00:01:34,861 --> 00:01:37,996
And in that moment,
I realized

36
00:01:37,998 --> 00:01:41,366
that Amy was the only woman
I ever wanted to kiss

37
00:01:41,368 --> 00:01:43,168
for the rest of my life.

38
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:46,638
So I came to New Jersey
to ask her to marry me.

39
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,440
Oh, that's so sweet.

40
00:01:48,442 --> 00:01:50,742
- Sheldon...
- Yeah, although

41
00:01:50,744 --> 00:01:53,945
there was one man
whose blessing I needed first.

42
00:01:53,947 --> 00:01:57,816
I've thought about it,
and I really want to spend

43
00:01:57,818 --> 00:02:00,318
the rest of my life with Amy.

44
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:03,054
Do I have your blessing?

45
00:02:03,056 --> 00:02:05,323
Well, Sheldon...

46
00:02:06,593 --> 00:02:09,561
...I think you should make
her finger like Saturn

47
00:02:09,563 --> 00:02:12,497
and put a ring on it.

48
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:16,501
You asked Stephen Hawking
and not her father?

49
00:02:16,503 --> 00:02:17,969
Stephen Hawking's a genius.

50
00:02:17,971 --> 00:02:22,207
If he said no, I wasn't gonna
waste my time on her father.

51
00:02:23,043 --> 00:02:25,110
But you did ask my father?

52
00:02:25,112 --> 00:02:27,846
I did. He said yes.

53
00:02:27,848 --> 00:02:30,615
Although, not in a robot voice,
so it wasn't nearly as cool.

54
00:02:30,617 --> 00:02:32,951
Okay. Oh, my God, I can't
believe you guys are engaged.

55
00:02:32,953 --> 00:02:34,452
We're not engaged, yet.

56
00:02:34,454 --> 00:02:36,054
She's taking forever to answer.

57
00:02:36,056 --> 00:02:38,256
Because you're on the phone!

58
00:02:40,227 --> 00:02:42,026
We'll call you back.

59
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:48,133
She said yes.

60
00:02:48,135 --> 00:02:50,001
Yay!
Congratulations!

Mother, I have
some good news to share.

72
00:03:23,828 --> 00:03:25,695
We're engaged.

73
00:03:27,098 --> 00:03:30,166
I am so happy for you two,
but I'm not surprised.

74
00:03:30,168 --> 00:03:31,567
I've been praying for this.

75
00:03:31,569 --> 00:03:33,602
Well, God had nothing
to do with it.

76
00:03:33,604 --> 00:03:36,205
It happened because I was
kissing another woman,

77
00:03:36,207 --> 00:03:39,642
and it made me realize
I wanted to be with Amy.

78
00:03:39,644 --> 00:03:41,677
More than one woman
was interested in you?

79
00:03:41,679 --> 00:03:44,413
I might have prayed
a little too hard.

80
00:03:44,415 --> 00:03:46,048
Wait, oh, and I just...

81
00:03:46,050 --> 00:03:47,316
I want to let you know
right now

82
00:03:47,318 --> 00:03:49,485
that we are not
getting married in a church.

83
00:03:49,487 --> 00:03:50,419
That's all right, Sheldon.

84
00:03:50,421 --> 00:03:53,255
Anywhere Jesus is
is a church.

85
00:03:53,257 --> 00:03:54,824
Well, he won't be
at our wedding.

86
00:03:54,826 --> 00:03:56,792
He's in my heart,
so if I'm there,

87
00:03:56,794 --> 00:03:58,694
he'll be there.

88
00:03:58,696 --> 00:04:00,229
Okay, well, then,
he's your plus-one.

89
00:04:00,231 --> 00:04:01,797
You don't get to bring
anyone else.

90
00:04:01,799 --> 00:04:03,833
That's fine.
Love you.

91
00:04:03,835 --> 00:04:05,501
Love you, too.
Bye.

92
00:04:06,938 --> 00:04:09,138
Lord, thank you.

93
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:10,873
Even though you can do anything,

94
00:04:10,875 --> 00:04:14,577
that was mighty
impressive.

95
00:04:15,213 --> 00:04:16,846
We're engaged.

96
00:04:16,848 --> 00:04:18,748
Oh, my God, that's amazing!

97
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:20,416
Wait, uh, tell me everything.

98
00:04:20,418 --> 00:04:23,085
Well, Dr. Nowitzki was
kissing me...

99
00:04:23,087 --> 00:04:25,621
Okay, you can stop leading
with that part of the story.

100
00:04:26,624 --> 00:04:28,224
Well, congratulations.

101
00:04:28,226 --> 00:04:29,725
I'm so happy
for you two.

102
00:04:29,727 --> 00:04:31,527
Hold on, I have to
tell Bernadette.

103
00:04:31,529 --> 00:04:32,695
Hey, Bernie, guess what?

104
00:04:32,697 --> 00:04:35,464
Sheldon and Amy got engaged.
Can you believe it?

105
00:04:35,466 --> 00:04:40,169
Oh, my God.
I cannot believe it.

106
00:04:41,672 --> 00:04:44,607
She's so happy...
I think she's crying.

107
00:04:47,678 --> 00:04:49,078
Do you think
Sheldon's gonna want

108
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:52,181
some weird
<i>Star Trek</i> wedding?

109
00:04:52,183 --> 00:04:54,383
I don't know.

110
00:04:54,385 --> 00:04:56,619
Well, Leonard could barely
finish the words

111
00:04:56,621 --> 00:04:57,787
"Doctor Who wedding cake"

112
00:04:57,789 --> 00:05:00,890
before I shut that down hard.

113
00:05:00,892 --> 00:05:02,425
Mm-hmm.

114
00:05:02,427 --> 00:05:04,693
Are you listening to me?

115
00:05:04,695 --> 00:05:07,430
Yeah, you're mean
to Leonard. I heard you.

116
00:05:07,432 --> 00:05:09,832
Is everything okay?

117
00:05:09,834 --> 00:05:13,135
Look, I'm gonna
tell you something,

118
00:05:13,137 --> 00:05:14,103
but you can't freak out,

119
00:05:14,105 --> 00:05:15,071
because I'm already
freaking out.

120
00:05:15,073 --> 00:05:17,306
Oh, my God,
what is it?

121
00:05:17,308 --> 00:05:19,442
I'm pregnant again.

122
00:05:19,444 --> 00:05:21,677
Wha...

123
00:05:27,452 --> 00:05:30,419
Interesting.

124
00:05:32,056 --> 00:05:33,756
Howard's gonna lose his mind.

125
00:05:33,758 --> 00:05:35,157
Wait, you haven't
told him yet?

126
00:05:35,159 --> 00:05:36,092
No.

127
00:05:36,094 --> 00:05:39,628
You told me first?
Oh, Bernie!

128
00:05:40,798 --> 00:05:43,265
This wasn't supposed
to happen-- we were careful.

129
00:05:43,267 --> 00:05:44,233
Yeah, I didn't even think
you could get pregnant

130
00:05:44,235 --> 00:05:45,267
while you were
breastfeeding.

131
00:05:45,269 --> 00:05:47,903
Well, guess what?
You can.

132
00:05:47,905 --> 00:05:50,506
Okay, look, look,
this is a good thing.

133
00:05:50,508 --> 00:05:51,974
Halley's gonna have
a little brother

134
00:05:51,976 --> 00:05:53,375
or sister to play with.

135
00:05:53,377 --> 00:05:55,945
I guess that would be
pretty cute.

136
00:05:55,947 --> 00:05:57,713
And, you, know, I was
a surprise to my parents,

137
00:05:57,715 --> 00:05:59,148
and my dad said
it was the best thing

138
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:00,649
that ever happened to them.

139
00:06:00,651 --> 00:06:04,320
Okay. Maybe this baby
actually is a blessing.

140
00:06:04,322 --> 00:06:06,188
Oh, my God, honey,
of course it is.

141
00:06:08,359 --> 00:06:09,725
How am I pregnant again?

142
00:06:09,727 --> 00:06:12,128
Yeah, what were you thinking?

143
00:06:15,133 --> 00:06:18,300
All right, I'm all
checked in to my flight.

144
00:06:18,302 --> 00:06:20,002
Well, I'm sad
you're leaving.

145
00:06:20,004 --> 00:06:22,071
Why'd you only book
a flight for one day?

146
00:06:22,073 --> 00:06:24,773
I came here to propose.

147
00:06:24,775 --> 00:06:26,709
If you'd said no,
I wouldn't want to stick around

148
00:06:26,711 --> 00:06:28,978
looking at your stupid face.

149
00:06:30,314 --> 00:06:32,548
Now, mind you,
your face is only stupid

150
00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:34,550
in the "no" version
of the story.

151
00:06:34,552 --> 00:06:38,754
But I said yes, so I get
a lifetime of this.

152
00:06:38,756 --> 00:06:41,357
Yes, you do, smart face.

153
00:06:41,359 --> 00:06:44,326
Why don't you stay
a few extra days?

154
00:06:44,328 --> 00:06:46,695
Well, I don't have
any other clothes.

155
00:06:46,697 --> 00:06:47,830
We'll get you some.

156
00:06:47,832 --> 00:06:49,665
Oh, I don't know,
I'm pretty particular.

157
00:06:49,667 --> 00:06:52,668
Well, there's a comic book store
less than a mile from here.

158
00:06:52,670 --> 00:06:55,471
Perfect, let's go shopping.

159
00:06:55,473 --> 00:06:58,407
Oh, um, and I'm having dinner
with some colleagues tonight.

160
00:06:58,409 --> 00:07:00,075
I'm sure they'd
love to meet you.

161
00:07:01,245 --> 00:07:03,012
Come on, what do you say?

162
00:07:03,014 --> 00:07:06,849
Aw, you're nagging me.

163
00:07:06,851 --> 00:07:08,951
It's like
we're already married.

164
00:07:08,953 --> 00:07:10,186
Is that a yes or a no?

165
00:07:10,188 --> 00:07:13,389
Geez, save some
for the honeymoon.

166
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:17,927
Look at Nowitzki
over there.

167
00:07:17,929 --> 00:07:19,128
I can't believe
she tried to steal

168
00:07:19,130 --> 00:07:20,896
Sheldon from Amy.

169
00:07:20,898 --> 00:07:22,531
You know what?

170
00:07:22,533 --> 00:07:24,433
I'm gonna go there and tell her
that they're engaged now

171
00:07:24,435 --> 00:07:26,535
and that her little plan
didn't work.

172
00:07:26,537 --> 00:07:27,736
Because you're sticking up
for Sheldon,

173
00:07:27,738 --> 00:07:29,738
or because you're still mad
she rejected you?

174
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:31,507
Too far away, can't hear you.

175
00:07:32,743 --> 00:07:33,776
Hello, Ramona.

176
00:07:33,778 --> 00:07:35,444
Mm. Hello.

177
00:07:35,446 --> 00:07:38,547
Why are you
sitting by yourself?

178
00:07:38,549 --> 00:07:39,882
Oh, that's right,

179
00:07:39,884 --> 00:07:43,052
Sheldon's in New Jersey
being engaged to Amy.

180
00:07:44,055 --> 00:07:45,621
I heard.

181
00:07:45,623 --> 00:07:47,256
Now that Sheldon's
out of the picture,

182
00:07:47,258 --> 00:07:51,060
I could give you one more chance
to go out with me.

183
00:07:51,062 --> 00:07:53,262
Nope, I'm good.

184
00:07:55,466 --> 00:07:58,033
You sure?

185
00:07:58,035 --> 00:08:00,469
I will not ask again.

186
00:08:00,471 --> 00:08:03,038
I sincerely hope not.

187
00:08:03,874 --> 00:08:05,808
Very well.

188
00:08:05,810 --> 00:08:08,377
I'm going to leave
before this gets awkward.

189
00:08:11,682 --> 00:08:13,649
Hey.

190
00:08:13,651 --> 00:08:14,883
Want me to make dinner?

191
00:08:14,885 --> 00:08:17,052
Uh, sure, but first,
why don't you have a seat?

192
00:08:17,054 --> 00:08:18,787
There's something
I need to show you.

193
00:08:18,789 --> 00:08:22,558
Ooh, if it's how to make
dinner, that'd be great.

194
00:08:30,401 --> 00:08:33,502
Is this a... pregnancy test?

195
00:08:33,504 --> 00:08:35,604
Yes.

196
00:08:38,909 --> 00:08:42,878
That means... positive?

197
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:45,147
Yes.

198
00:08:46,083 --> 00:08:47,950
No.

199
00:08:51,088 --> 00:08:52,054
Yes.

200
00:08:52,056 --> 00:08:55,157
N-- No.

201
00:08:56,027 --> 00:08:58,227
Yes.

202
00:08:59,563 --> 00:09:01,864
No!

203
00:09:05,536 --> 00:09:07,303
How could this even happen?

204
00:09:07,305 --> 00:09:09,405
Uh, w--
we were careful.

205
00:09:09,407 --> 00:09:10,873
- Well, it did.
- No!

206
00:09:10,875 --> 00:09:12,241
- Yes! Yes!
- No! No!

207
00:09:12,243 --> 00:09:13,542
- No! No!
- Yes! Yes! Yes!

208
00:09:13,544 --> 00:09:14,710
Okay! Okay! Okay!

209
00:09:14,712 --> 00:09:16,312
Well, w-what are we gonna do?

210
00:09:16,314 --> 00:09:17,780
What do you mean
what are we gonna do?

211
00:09:17,782 --> 00:09:18,847
We're gonna have another baby.

212
00:09:18,849 --> 00:09:20,349
- No! No!
- Stop that!

213
00:09:20,351 --> 00:09:22,151
- Yes!
- I'm trying!

214
00:09:24,689 --> 00:09:27,289
Look, I know
it's scary, but...

215
00:09:27,291 --> 00:09:30,759
we're both responsible adults,
we can do this.

216
00:09:30,761 --> 00:09:32,361
You really think so?

217
00:09:33,130 --> 00:09:35,798
No!

218
00:09:39,670 --> 00:09:41,670
Hey, Stuart.
Oh, hey, Raj.

219
00:09:41,672 --> 00:09:42,738
What can I help you with?

220
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:44,873
I need to buy
an engagement gift.

221
00:09:44,875 --> 00:09:47,810
Well, you came
to the wrong place.

222
00:09:47,812 --> 00:09:49,845
It's for Sheldon and Amy.

223
00:09:49,847 --> 00:09:52,147
No way! They're engaged?
Yeah.

224
00:09:52,149 --> 00:09:54,316
Well, that's exciting news.

225
00:09:54,318 --> 00:09:56,085
Who would've thought Sheldon
and Amy would be the next two

226
00:09:56,087 --> 00:09:57,086
to tie the knot?

227
00:09:57,088 --> 00:09:58,721
Tell me about it. I'm the one

228
00:09:58,723 --> 00:10:01,790
who caught the bouquet at
Leonard and Penny's wedding.

229
00:10:01,792 --> 00:10:03,125
Okay.

230
00:10:03,127 --> 00:10:04,693
Uh... you know,

231
00:10:04,695 --> 00:10:07,162
they might like this.

232
00:10:08,866 --> 00:10:11,100
Superman and Wonder Woman,
it's kind of romantic.

233
00:10:11,102 --> 00:10:12,835
Hmm.

234
00:10:12,837 --> 00:10:14,169
You know what?

235
00:10:14,171 --> 00:10:16,004
Why am I buying them a gift?

236
00:10:16,006 --> 00:10:16,939
They have love.

237
00:10:16,941 --> 00:10:18,440
Screw them and
their happiness.

238
00:10:18,442 --> 00:10:20,776
What do you have for someone
who's bitter and alone?

239
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:26,014
Literally everything.

240
00:10:27,184 --> 00:10:29,451
Sheldon, these are the heads
of my research team.

241
00:10:29,453 --> 00:10:30,586
Oh, hello.

242
00:10:30,588 --> 00:10:31,920
Dr. Zane, Dr. Harris,

243
00:10:31,922 --> 00:10:33,655
this is my fianc?,
Dr. Sheldon Cooper.

244
00:10:33,657 --> 00:10:35,023
That's the first time
I've said that

245
00:10:35,025 --> 00:10:36,892
and it kind of gave me
the goose bumps.

246
00:10:36,894 --> 00:10:39,061
Dr. Cooper,

247
00:10:39,063 --> 00:10:41,296
- we are so excited to meet you.
- Oh.

248
00:10:41,298 --> 00:10:43,198
Well, that's very kind of you.

249
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:46,702
If you'd like, I could autograph
your menus after dinner, yeah?

250
00:10:46,704 --> 00:10:48,871
But I better not see those
on eBay.

251
00:10:50,141 --> 00:10:51,974
No, no, no, we're just
excited to meet the man

252
00:10:51,976 --> 00:10:53,809
who landed
this brilliant woman here.

253
00:10:53,811 --> 00:10:54,877
Oh!

254
00:10:54,879 --> 00:10:55,944
That wasn't hard,

255
00:10:55,946 --> 00:10:57,780
she threw herself at me.

256
00:10:59,784 --> 00:11:02,184
Now, getting the universe
to show me its naughty bits,

257
00:11:02,186 --> 00:11:04,853
that-that took some doing.

258
00:11:04,855 --> 00:11:07,089
Sheldon's a physicist.

259
00:11:07,091 --> 00:11:09,992
Oh.
Oh, that's nice.

260
00:11:13,164 --> 00:11:14,763
Amy, I recently read
your paper on lesions

261
00:11:14,765 --> 00:11:16,965
in the olfactory receptors
in the brain.

262
00:11:16,967 --> 00:11:18,700
It was inspired.

263
00:11:18,702 --> 00:11:21,036
Oh, well,
I guess it didn't stink.

264
00:11:21,038 --> 00:11:23,305
But if it did,
that rat wouldn't have known it.

265
00:11:23,307 --> 00:11:25,574
I'm sorry,

266
00:11:25,576 --> 00:11:26,708
I'm sure you don't
want to sit here

267
00:11:26,710 --> 00:11:28,410
and listen to
a bunch of work talk.

268
00:11:28,412 --> 00:11:29,711
Oh, no, I love it.

269
00:11:29,713 --> 00:11:30,779
No, but let's talk about work.

270
00:11:30,781 --> 00:11:32,481
Amy's work, my work.

271
00:11:32,483 --> 00:11:34,149
Yeah, why don't
we start with my work?

272
00:11:35,619 --> 00:11:37,052
Actually, I do have
a question for Dr. Cooper.

273
00:11:37,054 --> 00:11:39,054
When Amy first
told you about

274
00:11:39,056 --> 00:11:41,089
her approach to
synaptic tracing,

275
00:11:41,091 --> 00:11:43,592
did you think it was gonna
revolutionize the field?

276
00:11:43,594 --> 00:11:45,561
Really?

277
00:11:45,563 --> 00:11:47,496
That's your question?

278
00:11:47,498 --> 00:11:49,531
What are you,
<i>Entertainment Tonight?</i>

279
00:11:49,533 --> 00:11:51,467
You know what?

280
00:11:51,469 --> 00:11:53,101
Let me give you a
better question. Here,

281
00:11:53,103 --> 00:11:54,570
um, "Dr. Cooper,

282
00:11:54,572 --> 00:11:56,939
"I heard you were working on
a top-secret project

283
00:11:56,941 --> 00:11:58,273
"for the U.S. military.

284
00:11:58,275 --> 00:11:59,408
Why don't you tell us
about that?"

285
00:11:59,410 --> 00:12:01,677
See, that's a great question.

286
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:04,613
Okay, what was that like?

287
00:12:04,615 --> 00:12:08,050
Oh, I can't tell you that,
it's top-secret.

288
00:12:17,928 --> 00:12:20,929
Boy, that was exhausting.

289
00:12:20,931 --> 00:12:23,398
You know, no offense, but your
colleagues were pretty rude.

290
00:12:25,168 --> 00:12:26,935
Really,<i> they</i> were rude?

291
00:12:26,937 --> 00:12:27,936
Yes.

292
00:12:27,938 --> 00:12:29,304
They just kept talking about you

293
00:12:29,306 --> 00:12:31,006
and how great you are,

294
00:12:31,008 --> 00:12:33,608
no matter how many times
I brought me up.

295
00:12:33,610 --> 00:12:35,410
You know,
these are my colleagues

296
00:12:35,412 --> 00:12:36,945
and they want to talk
about my work.

297
00:12:36,947 --> 00:12:38,813
Why does that bother you
so much?

298
00:12:38,815 --> 00:12:41,049
Because I was there.

299
00:12:41,051 --> 00:12:43,084
It's like having
Optimus Prime over to dinner

300
00:12:43,086 --> 00:12:45,253
and not asking him
to turn into a truck.

301
00:12:46,089 --> 00:12:48,089
You know what, Sheldon?

302
00:12:48,091 --> 00:12:50,859
You're not always the smartest
person in every room.

303
00:12:50,861 --> 00:12:53,428
You may not even be the smartest
person in this room.

304
00:12:53,430 --> 00:12:55,196
Oh, I am sorry.

305
00:12:55,198 --> 00:12:58,533
What, is Neil deGrasse Tyson
hiding behind the couch?

306
00:12:58,535 --> 00:12:59,734
'Cause if he is,
he's not that smart,

307
00:12:59,736 --> 00:13:01,836
it's pretty dusty back there.

308
00:13:05,175 --> 00:13:06,141
Hey, where are you going?

309
00:13:06,143 --> 00:13:08,009
I'm storming off to my room.

310
00:13:08,011 --> 00:13:10,245
Well, then where am I
supposed to storm off to?

311
00:13:10,247 --> 00:13:12,414
Well, you're so smart,
why don't you figure it out?

312
00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:18,553
Is there another bedroom?

313
00:13:19,856 --> 00:13:21,990
Perhaps a-a den?

314
00:13:24,895 --> 00:13:28,363
So, how are you guys
doing with all the new

315
00:13:28,365 --> 00:13:31,633
events in your womb?

316
00:13:33,437 --> 00:13:35,604
Good, you know?

317
00:13:35,606 --> 00:13:37,706
Obviously,
it was a surprise.

318
00:13:37,708 --> 00:13:39,774
There was some crying

319
00:13:39,776 --> 00:13:41,076
and some yelling.
Some suggestion

320
00:13:41,078 --> 00:13:42,777
of make-up sex
that did not go over well,

321
00:13:42,779 --> 00:13:44,779
even though it's not like
we can get more pregnant.

322
00:13:47,851 --> 00:13:50,952
But then we realized that
it's a gift, in the sense

323
00:13:50,954 --> 00:13:52,687
that we didn't
ask for it,

324
00:13:52,689 --> 00:13:54,089
and we may not
have chosen it...

325
00:13:54,091 --> 00:13:58,059
And we already have one.

326
00:13:58,061 --> 00:14:00,261
You know, whenever
I find a top I like,

327
00:14:00,263 --> 00:14:04,165
I always go back and get a
second one in a different color.

328
00:14:06,737 --> 00:14:11,139
Which I hope is not the case
with your baby.

329
00:14:12,676 --> 00:14:16,044
I know you guys are freaked out,
but you're great parents,

330
00:14:16,046 --> 00:14:18,847
and if you ever need help,
we are here for you.

331
00:14:18,849 --> 00:14:20,615
Yeah, anything at all, just ask.

332
00:14:21,652 --> 00:14:23,385
Ooh, you know what you could do?

333
00:14:23,387 --> 00:14:26,187
You could have a baby, too.

334
00:14:28,892 --> 00:14:31,559
I'm sorry, what?

335
00:14:31,561 --> 00:14:34,562
No, that's a great idea,
we could go through it together.

336
00:14:34,564 --> 00:14:35,964
Wouldn't that be fun?

337
00:14:37,167 --> 00:14:38,366
You guys were just saying

338
00:14:38,368 --> 00:14:40,769
how freaked out
and miserable you are.

339
00:14:40,771 --> 00:14:42,904
I say lots of crazy things.

340
00:14:42,906 --> 00:14:45,807
I'm pregnant and hormonal.

341
00:14:45,809 --> 00:14:48,176
Do it! Have a baby, do it!

342
00:14:49,546 --> 00:14:52,047
Come on, it'd be so cute,
our kids playing together?

343
00:14:52,049 --> 00:14:53,882
What do you say, why don't
you two hit the old mattress

344
00:14:53,884 --> 00:14:55,784
and whip up a family?

345
00:14:55,786 --> 00:14:57,285
Okay, we're not
gonna have a baby

346
00:14:57,287 --> 00:14:59,054
just to make you
guys feel better.

347
00:14:59,056 --> 00:15:01,956
Yeah, if we're gonna have a baby
it's gonna be when we are ready,

348
00:15:01,958 --> 00:15:03,692
or when I'm certain
Penny is gonna leave me.

349
00:15:03,694 --> 00:15:06,194
Exactly.

350
00:15:08,899 --> 00:15:11,599
They're my friends,
and I should be happy for them.

351
00:15:11,601 --> 00:15:13,134
A-And I'm trying,

352
00:15:13,136 --> 00:15:17,405
but all I feel is this gnawing,
empty sensation in my gut.

353
00:15:17,407 --> 00:15:19,374
I had that once.

354
00:15:19,376 --> 00:15:22,143
Turned out it was a tapeworm.

355
00:15:24,648 --> 00:15:26,381
Cool. Uh...

356
00:15:27,451 --> 00:15:28,683
It's just...

357
00:15:28,685 --> 00:15:30,852
it's hard talking
to my other friends about this,

358
00:15:30,854 --> 00:15:32,120
but I knew you would understand.

359
00:15:32,122 --> 00:15:33,354
Why is that?

360
00:15:33,356 --> 00:15:34,989
Because you and I
are both alone,

361
00:15:34,991 --> 00:15:36,991
which is actually
kind of comforting,

362
00:15:36,993 --> 00:15:39,127
because at least
we can be alone together.

363
00:15:39,129 --> 00:15:41,496
Mm. This is-this is awkward.

364
00:15:41,498 --> 00:15:44,599
I, um, I was actually gonna
close up a little early tonight

365
00:15:44,601 --> 00:15:46,301
'cause I have a date.

366
00:15:46,303 --> 00:15:48,069
Really?

367
00:15:48,071 --> 00:15:49,871
Yeah.

368
00:15:51,174 --> 00:15:54,776
Forgive me if I'm having trouble
being happy for you.

369
00:15:54,778 --> 00:15:59,347
Don't be silly,
I'm loving your pain.

370
00:16:02,252 --> 00:16:04,519
Is this how our marriage
is going to be?

371
00:16:04,521 --> 00:16:06,121
Sometimes people
will be more interested

372
00:16:06,123 --> 00:16:08,289
in talking to her than to me?

373
00:16:08,291 --> 00:16:11,259
Are you sitting in a bathroom?

374
00:16:11,261 --> 00:16:13,328
Yes.

375
00:16:13,330 --> 00:16:14,929
I needed a place to storm off to

376
00:16:14,931 --> 00:16:17,398
and it was all
that was available.

377
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:18,666
Fine.

378
00:16:18,668 --> 00:16:22,971
But if I hear a flush,
this conversation is over.

379
00:16:22,973 --> 00:16:26,341
Those people were in the
presence of a world-class mind,

380
00:16:26,343 --> 00:16:30,011
and all they wanted to talk
about was their own nonsense.

381
00:16:30,013 --> 00:16:33,748
Can you see the irony
in that statement?

382
00:16:35,585 --> 00:16:37,786
How about now?

383
00:16:39,723 --> 00:16:41,923
How about now?

384
00:16:44,961 --> 00:16:46,327
I'll wait.

385
00:16:48,532 --> 00:16:49,798
Uh...

386
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:51,166
Surprise.

387
00:16:51,168 --> 00:16:53,902
Oh, crap, is it our anniversary?

388
00:16:53,904 --> 00:16:55,236
No.

389
00:16:55,238 --> 00:16:57,438
Wait.

390
00:16:59,576 --> 00:17:00,742
No.

391
00:17:00,744 --> 00:17:02,010
No.

392
00:17:02,012 --> 00:17:03,812
All right, so what
are we celebrating?

393
00:17:03,814 --> 00:17:06,381
Well, you know, Bernadette
and Howard are pregnant again,

394
00:17:06,383 --> 00:17:08,149
and Amy and Sheldon
are getting married.

395
00:17:08,151 --> 00:17:09,818
I didn't want you
to feel left out.

396
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:11,686
Ah. Left out?

397
00:17:11,688 --> 00:17:13,721
Well, Bernadette has to grow
a baby inside of her,

398
00:17:13,723 --> 00:17:15,023
and Amy has to marry one.

399
00:17:15,025 --> 00:17:16,958
My life is great.

400
00:17:18,528 --> 00:17:20,094
So do you not want the cake?

401
00:17:20,096 --> 00:17:22,931
Try and take it away,
see what happens.

402
00:17:24,901 --> 00:17:28,469
Oh, crap,
it is our anniversary.

403
00:17:28,471 --> 00:17:31,439
Happy anniversary!

404
00:17:33,743 --> 00:17:35,476
Amy.

405
00:17:35,478 --> 00:17:39,881
There's something
I need to say to you.

406
00:17:39,883 --> 00:17:41,049
I'm listening.

407
00:17:42,252 --> 00:17:45,486
I've been thinking
about the Avengers.

408
00:17:47,090 --> 00:17:49,457
I believe that.

409
00:17:49,459 --> 00:17:50,859
But I don't think
that's something

410
00:17:50,861 --> 00:17:52,193
you needed to say to me.

411
00:17:52,195 --> 00:17:57,065
I realized
that Iron Man is great.

412
00:17:57,067 --> 00:17:58,266
And also,

413
00:17:58,268 --> 00:18:00,168
that Captain America is great.

414
00:18:00,170 --> 00:18:04,038
And sometimes, Iron Man
is in a Captain America movie,

415
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:06,774
and he's not mad
it's not an Iron Man movie.

416
00:18:06,776 --> 00:18:09,711
You know, he can fly in,
give the audience a thrill,

417
00:18:09,713 --> 00:18:11,045
and then fly away.

418
00:18:11,047 --> 00:18:14,883
And that should've
been me tonight.

419
00:18:14,885 --> 00:18:19,053
I should've been the delightful
cameo in your movie.

420
00:18:19,055 --> 00:18:21,356
Thank you, Sheldon.

421
00:18:21,358 --> 00:18:23,658
Instead, I was like
the Hulk, and I...

422
00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:26,194
Okay, please stop talking
about the Avengers.

423
00:18:27,397 --> 00:18:29,297
Anyway.

424
00:18:29,299 --> 00:18:31,199
I'm proud of you.

425
00:18:31,201 --> 00:18:32,934
And I'm going to try
to do a better job

426
00:18:32,936 --> 00:18:37,405
of sharing the spotlight
because we're a team.

427
00:18:37,407 --> 00:18:42,844
You know?
Much like t-the Dodgers.

428
00:18:44,714 --> 00:18:49,350
If they had superpowers,
and fought crime.

429
00:18:49,352 --> 00:18:53,354
And Thor was in them.

430
00:18:53,356 --> 00:18:55,256
Sheldon, I know this isn't easy,

431
00:18:55,258 --> 00:18:59,327
but you'll have
a whole lifetime to practice.

432
00:18:59,329 --> 00:19:03,631
I-It could take that long,
I'm really bad at it.

433
00:19:05,969 --> 00:19:08,069
You know, maybe, um,

434
00:19:08,071 --> 00:19:11,706
I should start right now,
and go back to Pasadena

435
00:19:11,708 --> 00:19:14,409
and let you have
this experience to yourself.

436
00:19:14,411 --> 00:19:16,277
You just want to go back

437
00:19:16,279 --> 00:19:18,546
'cause that's where everybody
makes a fuss over you.

438
00:19:18,548 --> 00:19:21,883
You know, your colleagues
are right, you are brilliant.

439
00:19:32,706 --> 00:19:34,239
Hello.

440
00:19:34,241 --> 00:19:35,533
- Hey. - Hey.
- Amy, welcome back.

441
00:19:35,534 --> 00:19:37,709
Oh, l-let me see the ring.

442
00:19:37,711 --> 00:19:40,211
Ooh, nice.

443
00:19:40,213 --> 00:19:42,514
H-Hey, her eyes are up there.

444
00:19:44,751 --> 00:19:47,419
I-Is that the woman
who kissed Sheldon?

445
00:19:47,421 --> 00:19:49,220
Uh... Could be.

446
00:19:49,222 --> 00:19:51,723
Hard to say.
Tell us about Princeton.

447
00:19:51,725 --> 00:19:53,491
Excuse me for a minute.

448
00:19:53,493 --> 00:19:55,360
Not-- well, we'll
catch up later.

449
00:19:55,362 --> 00:19:57,829
This is going to be
the biggest smackdown

450
00:19:57,831 --> 00:19:59,831
since my Aunt Noopur showed up
at the family reunion

451
00:19:59,833 --> 00:20:02,600
wearing the same sari
as my cousin Sruti.

452
00:20:03,870 --> 00:20:06,838
Dr. Nowitzki?

453
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:08,606
Oh.

454
00:20:08,608 --> 00:20:12,477
Dr. Fowler. Um, hello.

455
00:20:13,313 --> 00:20:15,046
Thank you. Thank you so much.

456
