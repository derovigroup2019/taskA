1
00:00:01,597 --> 00:00:05,132
Why are they making
four more <i>Avatar</i> movies?

2
00:00:05,134 --> 00:00:07,535
It's not like the first one
is even that good.

3
00:00:07,537 --> 00:00:09,904
What are you talking about?
You love that movie.

4
00:00:09,906 --> 00:00:11,906
You even went as <i>Avatar</i>
for Halloween.

5
00:00:11,908 --> 00:00:16,043
I remember. That was
not a lot of clothes.

6
00:00:16,045 --> 00:00:18,045
Hey, guys.

7
00:00:18,047 --> 00:00:19,380
- Hey.
- Hey.

8
00:00:19,382 --> 00:00:22,416
I'm, uh, I'm running
a special today, uh,

9
00:00:22,418 --> 00:00:26,086
buy something, keep having
a comic book store to come to.

10
00:00:26,088 --> 00:00:28,055
This is awkward.

11
00:00:28,057 --> 00:00:29,890
I was actually gonna
return this.

12
00:00:29,892 --> 00:00:31,592
What's wrong with it?

13
00:00:31,594 --> 00:00:33,460
I-I finished it.

14
00:00:34,397 --> 00:00:37,865
Speaking of something
I find interesting,

15
00:00:37,867 --> 00:00:40,768
did anyone read that article
about Bitcoin I sent you?

16
00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:42,670
Yeah, I can't believe
a single Bitcoin

17
00:00:42,672 --> 00:00:45,072
is worth about $5,000 now.

18
00:00:45,074 --> 00:00:48,776
Wait, didn't we mine some
a few years ago?

19
00:00:48,778 --> 00:00:50,911
It was seven years ago.

20
00:00:50,913 --> 00:00:53,347
Oh, yeah, I remember that.

21
00:00:53,349 --> 00:00:55,316
Really? All I can remember
from seven years ago

22
00:00:55,318 --> 00:00:59,053
is I couldn't get Kesha's
"Tik Tok" out of my head.

23
00:00:59,055 --> 00:01:02,756
? Tik Tok, on the clock... ?
Whoa, welcome home, Kesha.

24
00:01:04,193 --> 00:01:05,693
No, we-we definitely mined some.

25
00:01:05,695 --> 00:01:08,329
I-I remember sitting in your
bedroom and writing the program.

26
00:01:08,331 --> 00:01:10,497
I think we ended up
with a bunch of it.

27
00:01:10,499 --> 00:01:13,834
Wow, and at, like,
$5,000 apiece, that's...

28
00:01:13,836 --> 00:01:17,304
Sounds like a lot of money,
which we agreed to share

29
00:01:17,306 --> 00:01:20,874
'cause I-I was totally there.
I remember now.

30
00:01:21,944 --> 00:01:24,144
I can't believe
we forgot about it.

31
00:01:24,146 --> 00:01:25,212
It's not that surprising.

32
00:01:25,214 --> 00:01:27,047
They were basically worthless
when we got them.

33
00:01:27,049 --> 00:01:29,316
I wish I knew
how much we had.

34
00:01:29,318 --> 00:01:30,918
Sheldon,
you must remember.

35
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:32,386
Of course I do.

36
00:01:32,388 --> 00:01:34,755
Oh, yeah, he and I
totally remember.

37
00:01:35,558 --> 00:01:38,058
You tell them, Sheldon.

38
00:01:39,295 --> 00:01:42,429
I can't believe you haven't
seen <i>Avatar</i> yet.

39
00:01:42,431 --> 00:01:43,764
What is wrong with you?

40
00:01:43,766 --> 00:01:45,299
Penny and I just started dating,

41
00:01:45,301 --> 00:01:47,201
and you know
I don't like big crowds.

42
00:01:47,203 --> 00:01:49,436
Because you're afraid Penny will
leave you for someone in them?

43
00:01:49,438 --> 00:01:50,971
Terrified.

44
00:01:52,074 --> 00:01:53,474
Yes, instead of going out,

45
00:01:53,476 --> 00:01:55,976
they just stay home
and have constant coitus.

46
00:01:55,978 --> 00:02:00,748
Well, I didn't want to say it,
but I-I do like to hear it.

47
00:02:01,584 --> 00:02:05,319
Yes, Ma, I'll be
home for dinner.

48
00:02:05,321 --> 00:02:09,156
No, I'm not ruining
my appetite with candy.

49
00:02:10,026 --> 00:02:11,925
Oh, we're having brisket?

50
00:02:11,927 --> 00:02:13,460
Be home at 6:00.

51
00:02:15,598 --> 00:02:16,864
Maybe we should double date.

52
00:02:16,866 --> 00:02:19,099
I'll bring Penny
and you can bring your mom.

53
00:02:20,136 --> 00:02:21,302
Oh, make your jokes,

54
00:02:21,304 --> 00:02:23,037
but my date started
a savings account for me.

55
00:02:23,039 --> 00:02:24,238
Did yours?

56
00:02:25,975 --> 00:02:27,474
- Hey, you guys.
- Hey.

57
00:02:27,476 --> 00:02:28,842
Oh, Stuart, good.
I was wondering,

58
00:02:28,844 --> 00:02:30,678
will you be accepting Bitcoin?

59
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:33,881
Well, I don't know what that is,
but it's got "coin" in it,

60
00:02:33,883 --> 00:02:38,952
and my cash register doesn't,
so... yeah.

61
00:02:39,689 --> 00:02:41,188
Wait, what's Bitcoin?

62
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:43,824
It's a new online currency
that's been developed.

63
00:02:43,826 --> 00:02:45,759
Uh, it's just like
actual money,

64
00:02:45,761 --> 00:02:49,229
except you can't see it, hold
it, or spend it on anything.

65
00:02:49,231 --> 00:02:52,599
Sounds like the kind of money
I'm familiar with.

66
00:02:54,670 --> 00:02:56,437
If it's not tangible,
how do you know

67
00:02:56,439 --> 00:02:58,539
it's not just gonna
vanish tomorrow?

68
00:02:58,541 --> 00:03:00,607
Really? You're dating Penny, and
you're gonna poke at something

69
00:03:00,609 --> 00:03:02,309
that could vanish tomorrow?

70
00:03:03,312 --> 00:03:04,812
I'll buy some Bitcoin.

71
00:03:04,814 --> 00:03:06,714
I just came into
a little extra money

72
00:03:06,716 --> 00:03:08,649
when my dad raised my allowance.

73
00:03:08,651 --> 00:03:11,819
You don't have
to buy Bitcoin.

74
00:03:11,821 --> 00:03:13,153
You can mine it.

75
00:03:13,155 --> 00:03:15,923
Mine it?
Like, mining gold?

76
00:03:15,925 --> 00:03:17,591
Sort of.
There's a limited amount,

77
00:03:17,593 --> 00:03:20,194
and we find it,
not by tunneling into the earth,

78
00:03:20,196 --> 00:03:23,597
but by using a computer to solve
complex mathematical problems.

79
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:24,732
So let me get this straight.

80
00:03:24,734 --> 00:03:26,533
We have to write
an elaborate program

81
00:03:26,535 --> 00:03:30,304
in order to find a fake coin
that we can't spend on anything?

82
00:03:30,306 --> 00:03:32,973
Yes.
That sounds fun.

83
00:03:32,975 --> 00:03:34,041
Yeah, I'm in.

84
00:03:34,043 --> 00:03:35,109
Staying up late,

85
00:03:35,111 --> 00:03:37,678
writing code,
it sounds like a party.

86
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,113
Hey, Stuart.

87
00:03:39,115 --> 00:03:40,614
You want to mine
some Bitcoin with us?

88
00:03:40,616 --> 00:03:42,015
We'll write the program,
you bring the snacks?

89
00:03:42,017 --> 00:03:44,651
Too rich for my blood.

90
00:03:44,653 --> 00:03:47,454
All right, so just
the four of us.

91
00:03:47,456 --> 00:03:48,689
Before we begin,

92
00:03:48,691 --> 00:03:52,559
this may have some
unprecedented tax implications.

93
00:03:52,561 --> 00:03:54,395
In fact, we should start
early 'cause we are gonna be

94
00:03:54,397 --> 00:03:56,230
on the phone with
the IRS for hours.

95
00:03:56,232 --> 00:03:58,832
Did anybody else
just get goose bumps?

96
00:03:59,502 --> 00:04:01,769
Great, so just the three of us.

97
00:04:03,139 --> 00:04:05,539
Oh, yeah.
We did it without you.

98
00:04:05,541 --> 00:04:08,041
And do you remember
what happened next?

99
00:04:08,043 --> 00:04:11,278
Your mom called my mom
and said we were being mean?

100
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,881
And after that?

101
00:04:14,850 --> 00:04:17,684
You said that someday
we'd regret this.

102
00:04:17,686 --> 00:04:19,219
And do you know

103
00:04:19,221 --> 00:04:20,587
what today is?

104
00:04:20,589 --> 00:04:23,724
The day we found out we're rich
and none of it is yours?

105
00:04:25,795 --> 00:04:29,930
Yeah, that's right!
Up top!

106
00:04:29,932 --> 00:04:33,567
? Our whole universe
was in a hot, dense state ?

107
00:04:33,569 --> 00:04:36,904
? Then nearly 14 billion years
ago expansion started... Wait! ?

108
00:04:36,906 --> 00:04:38,539
? The Earth began to cool ?

109
00:04:38,541 --> 00:04:41,074
? The autotrophs began to drool,
Neanderthals developed tools ?

110
00:04:41,076 --> 00:04:43,744
? We built the Wall ?
? <i>We built the pyramids</i> ?

111
00:04:43,746 --> 00:04:46,413
? Math, Science, History,
unraveling the mystery ?

112
00:04:46,415 --> 00:04:48,315
? That all started
with a big bang ?

113
00:04:48,317 --> 00:04:48,417
? <i>Bang!</i> ?

114
00:04:48,418 --> 00:04:52,418

116
00:04:54,332 --> 00:04:56,644
Okay, this is the laptop

117
00:04:56,645 --> 00:04:58,278
I was using in 2010.

118
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:00,146
The Bitcoin
must be on here.

119
00:05:00,148 --> 00:05:02,849
So what are you gonna do
with your share of the money?

120
00:05:02,851 --> 00:05:04,350
Uh, well,
as a responsible adult,

121
00:05:04,352 --> 00:05:06,986
I'll put that money into a CD,
wait for that CD to mature,

122
00:05:06,988 --> 00:05:09,389
and then buy a tiger.

123
00:05:15,464 --> 00:05:16,663
How about you?

124
00:05:16,665 --> 00:05:17,831
Oh, that depends on

125
00:05:17,833 --> 00:05:20,733
whether I tell
Bernadette or not.

126
00:05:20,735 --> 00:05:22,135
Howard, I can hear you.

127
00:05:22,137 --> 00:05:23,937
The baby monitor is on.

128
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:27,507
I know. I was joking.

129
00:05:27,509 --> 00:05:28,608
I'm gonna put it

130
00:05:28,610 --> 00:05:30,143
in a college fund.

131
00:05:34,950 --> 00:05:36,950
All right, all booted up.

132
00:05:36,952 --> 00:05:38,885
Wow, I-I knew you
were single back then,

133
00:05:38,887 --> 00:05:40,520
but that is
a lot of porn...

134
00:05:40,522 --> 00:05:42,956
Science!
A lot of science.

135
00:05:42,958 --> 00:05:46,893
Wow, you were really
into Asian science.

136
00:05:49,030 --> 00:05:50,763
I don't see the Bitcoin on here.

137
00:05:50,765 --> 00:05:52,465
Hey, maybe it's in
that folder marked

138
00:05:52,467 --> 00:05:53,800
"Private and Confidential."

139
00:05:53,802 --> 00:05:55,368
It's not!

140
00:05:57,372 --> 00:06:00,073
Okay, the program
is almost ready to run.

141
00:06:00,075 --> 00:06:02,976
Mining for coins
sounds so manly.

142
00:06:02,978 --> 00:06:05,979
Ooh, we should sing
a mining song.

143
00:06:05,981 --> 00:06:07,647
Do you know a mining song?

144
00:06:07,649 --> 00:06:08,715
I don't know.

145
00:06:08,717 --> 00:06:10,583
Does "Tik Tok"
by Kesha count?

146
00:06:10,585 --> 00:06:13,720
Because it has tunneled
its way into my heart.

147
00:06:14,923 --> 00:06:16,723
Howard, what's going on?!

148
00:06:16,725 --> 00:06:18,525
Are you boys roughhousing?!

149
00:06:18,527 --> 00:06:20,827
No, we're not roughhousing!

150
00:06:20,829 --> 00:06:24,564
We're scientists!
Scientists don't roughhouse!

151
00:06:24,566 --> 00:06:28,067
Excuse me, Mr. Grown-up.

152
00:06:29,638 --> 00:06:30,970
Aw, man,
what happened?

153
00:06:30,972 --> 00:06:32,238
It crashed.

154
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,840
It's been doing that lately.

155
00:06:33,842 --> 00:06:36,476
I think it's got a virus
from all the...

156
00:06:36,478 --> 00:06:39,178
music I've been downloading.

157
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:40,680
What kind of music?

158
00:06:40,682 --> 00:06:43,383
Mostly Asian.

159
00:06:45,787 --> 00:06:47,487
Some oldies.

160
00:06:47,489 --> 00:06:50,857
Well, we can
use my laptop.

161
00:06:50,859 --> 00:06:53,026
Howard, I made cookies

162
00:06:53,028 --> 00:06:55,361
for you and your little friends!

163
00:06:55,363 --> 00:06:58,331
They're not my little friends,
and we don't want cookies!

164
00:06:58,333 --> 00:06:59,365
Actually, a cookie sounds good.

165
00:06:59,367 --> 00:07:00,633
All right, we'll have cookies!

166
00:07:00,635 --> 00:07:02,235
Thank you very much!

167
00:07:03,305 --> 00:07:05,371
That's right.
It must be on my old laptop.

168
00:07:05,373 --> 00:07:06,639
Well, let's go.

169
00:07:06,641 --> 00:07:08,541
Hey, Bernie, you mind if
I run to Leonard's and...

170
00:07:08,543 --> 00:07:09,943
Get a laptop full of money?

171
00:07:09,945 --> 00:07:13,046
Why are you still here?!
Go, go, go!

172
00:07:15,383 --> 00:07:17,050
So, how's the wedding
planning going?

173
00:07:17,052 --> 00:07:18,518
Great.

174
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:21,054
Although, we're having trouble
agreeing on a location.

175
00:07:21,056 --> 00:07:22,889
I thought you were looking
at a cliff on the beach.

176
00:07:22,891 --> 00:07:25,858
We were, but Sheldon
didn't like any of them.

177
00:07:27,462 --> 00:07:32,131
Some were too beachy,
some were too cliffy.

178
00:07:32,133 --> 00:07:35,635
And all of them
were too outsidey.

179
00:07:36,705 --> 00:07:38,271
Well, weddings aren't
about the location.

180
00:07:38,273 --> 00:07:40,506
They're about standing up in
front of your family and friends

181
00:07:40,508 --> 00:07:43,710
and promising that Sheldon
will never move back in here.

182
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:47,614
- Hi.
- Hey.

183
00:07:47,616 --> 00:07:48,715
What are you guys doing?

184
00:07:48,717 --> 00:07:50,917
Uh, we have a bunch of Bitcoin
on an old laptop,

185
00:07:50,919 --> 00:07:52,885
and it could be worth,
like, a lot of money.

186
00:07:52,887 --> 00:07:53,920
What-- You're kidding.

187
00:07:53,922 --> 00:07:56,422
No. We-we could be
sitting on a fortune.

188
00:07:56,424 --> 00:07:58,625
Okay, let the record show,
I did not marry you for money,

189
00:07:58,627 --> 00:08:00,994
but you just got
way more attractive.

190
00:08:00,996 --> 00:08:03,997
Damn it,
it's not in here.

191
00:08:03,999 --> 00:08:07,400
If only you had someone around
with an eidetic memory.

192
00:08:09,070 --> 00:08:11,571
I bet they would know
what happened to it.

193
00:08:11,573 --> 00:08:13,339
If you know, just tell us.

194
00:08:13,341 --> 00:08:15,541
Excuse me, but if I recall
from seven years ago,

195
00:08:15,543 --> 00:08:17,910
you don't want me
to be a part of this.

196
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:20,446
Sheldon,
you can't still be mad.

197
00:08:20,448 --> 00:08:21,547
Oh, please.

198
00:08:21,549 --> 00:08:23,583
I have grudges that
go back to preschool.

199
00:08:24,986 --> 00:08:27,487
Someday, I'm gonna find
a grown-up Elaine Dwyer

200
00:08:27,489 --> 00:08:31,124
and eat her favorite crayon
while she watches.

201
00:08:31,126 --> 00:08:34,661
Is that why there's an
Elaine Dwyer on our guest list?

202
00:08:34,663 --> 00:08:36,095
Yes.

203
00:08:36,097 --> 00:08:38,231
That night, I'm going to have
the first dance

204
00:08:38,233 --> 00:08:41,200
and the last laugh.

205
00:08:41,202 --> 00:08:43,269
Sheldon, please.

206
00:08:43,271 --> 00:08:45,505
Should I be the bigger man?

207
00:08:45,507 --> 00:08:46,873
I think you should.

208
00:08:46,875 --> 00:08:48,841
Oh, why'd I ask you?

209
00:08:51,646 --> 00:08:54,313
Hey there, pretty lady.

210
00:08:54,315 --> 00:08:56,816
I'm not waiting
on your table for you.

211
00:08:56,818 --> 00:09:00,186
Come on,
this one is so annoying.

212
00:09:00,188 --> 00:09:02,055
Excuse me, waitress.

213
00:09:02,057 --> 00:09:04,590
You guys ready
to order?

214
00:09:04,592 --> 00:09:06,526
Can you take
our picture, please?

215
00:09:06,528 --> 00:09:07,927
Oh, sure.

216
00:09:07,929 --> 00:09:09,128
Smile!

217
00:09:13,268 --> 00:09:14,967
Perfect.

218
00:09:14,969 --> 00:09:16,969
Thank you.
You may go now.

219
00:09:16,971 --> 00:09:18,137
It was nice to meet you,

220
00:09:18,139 --> 00:09:21,708
and I mean that politely,
not sincerely.

221
00:09:22,744 --> 00:09:24,043
What was that?

222
00:09:24,045 --> 00:09:26,446
I need to prove to my mother
that I'm on a date.

223
00:09:26,448 --> 00:09:27,814
If she thinks
I faked the picture,

224
00:09:27,816 --> 00:09:29,649
I might need you as a witness.
What's your name?

225
00:09:29,651 --> 00:09:32,318
Bernadette.

226
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,320
Hey, sweetie.

227
00:09:34,322 --> 00:09:35,254
Hey.
Everybody good?

228
00:09:35,256 --> 00:09:36,989
- Yeah. - Fine.
- Sure.

229
00:09:39,027 --> 00:09:42,161
You don't have to whisper,
you can just nod your head.

230
00:09:44,132 --> 00:09:46,499
Or you could just speak.

231
00:09:48,336 --> 00:09:49,769
You having a good day?

232
00:09:49,771 --> 00:09:51,204
No, I missed an audition

233
00:09:51,206 --> 00:09:53,072
because my computer broke,
and I didn't get the e-mail.

234
00:09:53,074 --> 00:09:55,074
Would've been
a perfect part for me.

235
00:09:55,076 --> 00:09:56,876
Was it waitress
who ignores her customers?

236
00:09:56,878 --> 00:09:59,212
Because that's the role
you were born to play.

237
00:09:59,214 --> 00:10:01,881
Shut up and eat your burger.

238
00:10:01,883 --> 00:10:04,117
Actually, it's a turkey club.

239
00:10:04,119 --> 00:10:05,118
Didn't you order a burger?

240
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:07,386
I did, and yet here we are.

241
00:10:07,388 --> 00:10:10,223
You know what,
if you need a computer,

242
00:10:10,225 --> 00:10:11,891
you can use my laptop.

243
00:10:11,893 --> 00:10:14,093
Oh, that's sweet, but I'm not
gonna take your computer.

244
00:10:14,095 --> 00:10:15,728
Oh, it's fine.
I-I'm getting a new one anyway.

245
00:10:15,730 --> 00:10:17,363
- Are you sure?
- Don't be silly.

246
00:10:17,365 --> 00:10:19,198
He's desperate
to hold on to you.

247
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,033
You can get anything out of him.

248
00:10:21,035 --> 00:10:22,502
His car, his watch...

249
00:10:22,504 --> 00:10:24,637
Maybe a kidney.
You already have his testicles.

250
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:26,706
You can start a collection.

251
00:10:28,276 --> 00:10:30,810
Oh, my God, that's right.
You gave me your laptop.

252
00:10:30,812 --> 00:10:32,044
That was so sweet.

253
00:10:32,046 --> 00:10:33,579
So you know where it is?
Of course.

254
00:10:33,581 --> 00:10:34,914
- All right! - Yes!
- Great!

255
00:10:34,916 --> 00:10:36,182
I gave it to
my ex-boyfriend Zack.

256
00:10:36,184 --> 00:10:38,417
- Come on! - Why?!
- No!

257
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:43,085
Okay, Zack,
thank you so much.

258
00:10:43,087 --> 00:10:44,119
We'll be right over.

259
00:10:44,121 --> 00:10:45,754
He still has it.

260
00:10:45,756 --> 00:10:48,624
I can't believe you took
a gift from me

261
00:10:48,626 --> 00:10:50,159
and gave it to another man.

262
00:10:50,161 --> 00:10:51,694
Really?

263
00:10:51,696 --> 00:10:53,762
Of all the things she's given
to other men,

264
00:10:53,764 --> 00:10:55,264
that's what you're
concerned about?

265
00:10:57,235 --> 00:10:59,668
Please don't make
a big deal about this.

266
00:10:59,670 --> 00:11:02,238
It was a long time ago,
we were broken up.

267
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:03,405
Which breakup was that?

268
00:11:03,407 --> 00:11:05,774
Was that the Saint
Valentine's Day Massacre?

269
00:11:06,477 --> 00:11:07,843
No, no.

270
00:11:07,845 --> 00:11:10,312
This might've been during
the Comic-Con Dump-A-Thon.

271
00:11:11,215 --> 00:11:12,648
You have names for our breakups?

272
00:11:12,650 --> 00:11:15,417
Well, they would really
blur together if we didn't.

273
00:11:16,554 --> 00:11:18,287
The Comic-Con breakup's
easy to remember

274
00:11:18,289 --> 00:11:21,957
because Leonard
was the saddest Pikachu.

275
00:11:21,959 --> 00:11:24,360
Right, and he wiped his nose
on your cape,

276
00:11:24,362 --> 00:11:26,762
and then you were
the saddest Darth Vader.

277
00:11:28,666 --> 00:11:31,900
You know, Penny and I aren't
the only ones who've broken up.

278
00:11:31,902 --> 00:11:33,435
So did Howard and Bernadette.

279
00:11:33,437 --> 00:11:37,873
Uh, not to brag, but all
my breakups have lasted.

280
00:11:39,410 --> 00:11:41,744
I'm so sorry to hear
about you and Howard.

281
00:11:41,746 --> 00:11:43,979
Thanks. I just
didn't think he was

282
00:11:43,981 --> 00:11:46,649
the kind of guy who would be
doing weird stuff online.

283
00:11:46,651 --> 00:11:50,052
Really? Wow, I thought
it was so obvious, but okay.

284
00:11:51,289 --> 00:11:53,489
Look, I know it's hard,
but I think the best thing

285
00:11:53,491 --> 00:11:55,624
to do after a breakup
is to take some time

286
00:11:55,626 --> 00:11:56,659
and be by yourself.

287
00:11:56,661 --> 00:11:59,061
Yeah, that's healthy.

288
00:11:59,063 --> 00:12:00,229
Hey, babe,
ready to go?

289
00:12:00,231 --> 00:12:02,298
Do as I say, not as I do.

290
00:12:06,003 --> 00:12:08,671
I cannot believe you're mad.

291
00:12:08,673 --> 00:12:09,772
I'm not mad.

292
00:12:09,774 --> 00:12:12,074
Oh, really?
Tell that to your eyebrows.

293
00:12:12,076 --> 00:12:15,911
Bet I could place a
quarter between them,

294
00:12:15,913 --> 00:12:18,714
and it would
just stay there.

295
00:12:18,716 --> 00:12:20,883
Fine, I'm mad.

296
00:12:20,885 --> 00:12:23,485
I guess I was more upset
by our breakup than you.

297
00:12:23,487 --> 00:12:25,587
That is not true.
Of course I was upset.

298
00:12:25,589 --> 00:12:26,755
Didn't seem like it.

299
00:12:26,757 --> 00:12:28,157
You started dating the first

300
00:12:28,159 --> 00:12:30,359
tall, handsome hunk
you could find.

301
00:12:30,361 --> 00:12:31,660
I'm sorry,

302
00:12:31,662 --> 00:12:36,665
are you mad that I dated Zack
or that you didn't?

303
00:12:41,472 --> 00:12:43,372
- Hi. - Hi.
- Hey, Zack.

304
00:12:43,374 --> 00:12:45,741
So good to see you guys.

305
00:12:45,743 --> 00:12:48,644
Man, we should
do this more often.

306
00:12:48,646 --> 00:12:51,046
Come over to get laptops
back from you?

307
00:12:51,048 --> 00:12:52,414
Totally.

308
00:12:52,416 --> 00:12:55,084
So do you have it?

309
00:12:55,086 --> 00:12:57,186
Of course I do.
Penny gave it to me as a gift.

310
00:12:57,188 --> 00:12:59,021
You don't get rid
of something like that.

311
00:13:02,293 --> 00:13:04,626
Huh.

312
00:13:04,628 --> 00:13:06,862
All right, I'm sorry
I gave away your stupid laptop.

313
00:13:06,864 --> 00:13:09,732
You should be. We were broken
up for, like, five minutes.

314
00:13:09,734 --> 00:13:10,699
Are you guys fighting?

315
00:13:10,701 --> 00:13:11,867
Yeah.
No.

316
00:13:11,869 --> 00:13:13,035
Are you fighting about

317
00:13:13,037 --> 00:13:14,303
whether or not you're fighting?

318
00:13:14,305 --> 00:13:15,604
'Cause I've had
that fight before.

319
00:13:15,606 --> 00:13:18,240
Turns out we were,
and I lost.

320
00:13:18,242 --> 00:13:20,376
Leonard thinks when we broke up,
it didn't bother me.

321
00:13:20,378 --> 00:13:21,744
That's crazy.

322
00:13:21,746 --> 00:13:24,380
When we were going out, she used
to talk about you all the time.

323
00:13:24,382 --> 00:13:26,215
In fact, I think
she only dated me

324
00:13:26,217 --> 00:13:29,485
because I reminded her of you.

325
00:13:32,256 --> 00:13:35,057
Sure.

326
00:13:35,059 --> 00:13:37,092
Because we're both...

327
00:13:37,094 --> 00:13:39,128
people?

328
00:13:39,130 --> 00:13:41,096
Damn right we are.

329
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:45,434
Oh, also, there was that video
about how much she missed you.

330
00:13:45,436 --> 00:13:48,103
What video?
The one on the laptop.

331
00:13:48,105 --> 00:13:52,174
I didn't mean to invade your
privacy, but I am a huge snoop.

332
00:13:52,176 --> 00:13:54,109
Ask my neighbor.
She'll tell you.

333
00:13:54,111 --> 00:13:56,345
But not right now;
she's in the shower.

334
00:14:04,855 --> 00:14:06,989
Hello, Leonard.

335
00:14:06,991 --> 00:14:10,492
I was gonna write you an e-mail,
but I'm a little drunk,

336
00:14:10,494 --> 00:14:14,763
and spelling is
a sober person's game, so...

337
00:14:16,967 --> 00:14:20,102
I feel I owe you a 'splanation.

338
00:14:20,104 --> 00:14:22,771
I-- I'm sorry.

339
00:14:22,773 --> 00:14:24,873
A 'splanation.

340
00:14:26,177 --> 00:14:28,210
Penny. Penny.

341
00:14:28,212 --> 00:14:29,344
Penny.

342
00:14:29,346 --> 00:14:31,413
Sheldon, go away.
I'm making a video.

343
00:14:31,415 --> 00:14:32,581
Oh, I'm sorry.

344
00:14:32,583 --> 00:14:34,583
I'll come back
when you're alone.

345
00:14:34,585 --> 00:14:37,286
No, no, no.
I am alone.

346
00:14:37,288 --> 00:14:39,788
I'm just telling Leonard
why I broke up with him.

347
00:14:39,790 --> 00:14:41,356
Oh, he knows.

348
00:14:41,358 --> 00:14:42,791
The video I want to see

349
00:14:42,793 --> 00:14:45,260
is why you went out with him
in the first place.

350
00:14:45,262 --> 00:14:48,330
I went out with him
because he's great.

351
00:14:48,332 --> 00:14:50,399
And if I kept
going out with him,

352
00:14:50,401 --> 00:14:51,867
I probably would've married him,

353
00:14:51,869 --> 00:14:53,569
and that's
a little scary

354
00:14:53,571 --> 00:14:55,604
because I just don't think
I'm ready for that.

355
00:14:55,606 --> 00:15:00,609
You know, plus I have got to
learn how to spell Hofstadter.

356
00:15:00,611 --> 00:15:02,077
I-I know there's
a "D" in there,

357
00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:06,515
but it keeps moving
every time I try and write it.

358
00:15:06,517 --> 00:15:08,884
Sheldon, what do I do?

359
00:15:08,886 --> 00:15:12,654
Try to pass out facedown, so you
don't choke on your vomit.

360
00:15:13,557 --> 00:15:16,925
I am not
gonna pass out.

361
00:15:16,927 --> 00:15:20,062
But thank you anyway.

362
00:15:24,668 --> 00:15:26,902
Wow.
I know.

363
00:15:26,904 --> 00:15:29,905
There's, like, two more hours
of her just lying there.

364
00:15:32,476 --> 00:15:35,777
Aw, you love me
so much.

365
00:15:35,779 --> 00:15:38,046
I married you,
jackass.

366
00:15:38,048 --> 00:15:40,315
I... I know, and not
just out of pity

367
00:15:40,317 --> 00:15:43,519
like everyone said
in their wedding toast.

368
00:15:43,521 --> 00:15:45,454
You want to see the part
where she falls off the chair?

369
00:15:45,456 --> 00:15:47,155
No.
Totally.

370
00:15:58,736 --> 00:16:01,803
That's my wife.

371
00:16:01,805 --> 00:16:04,406
I got to see that again.

372
00:16:05,543 --> 00:16:09,044
Got the laptop.
Hand it here.

373
00:16:09,046 --> 00:16:10,946
Oh, this is
so exciting!

374
00:16:10,948 --> 00:16:13,482
Hey, when we sell the Bitcoin,
are you gonna pay your dad back

375
00:16:13,484 --> 00:16:15,284
all the money you took from him
over the years?

376
00:16:15,286 --> 00:16:18,620
Never even
crossed my mind.

377
00:16:18,622 --> 00:16:21,023
Okay, here's
the Bitcoin folder.

378
00:16:21,025 --> 00:16:22,724
Yeah, how much
is in there?

379
00:16:24,028 --> 00:16:25,994
It's empty.

380
00:16:25,996 --> 00:16:27,496
What?
Th-That's impossible.

381
00:16:27,498 --> 00:16:30,365
Do you think Zack stole it?

382
00:16:30,367 --> 00:16:32,634
No, he doesn't know
how to steal Bitcoin.

383
00:16:32,636 --> 00:16:34,836
I mean, he waves at trucks.

384
00:16:37,474 --> 00:16:40,609
Hmm...
who could it have been?

385
00:16:42,179 --> 00:16:44,680
Sheldon,
what did you do?

386
00:16:44,682 --> 00:16:46,248
I plotted my revenge.

387
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:50,218
If you get a dish,
I'll serve you some cold.

388
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:53,021
What, y-you stole
our Bitcoin?

389
00:16:53,023 --> 00:16:54,056
Oh, calm down.

390
00:16:54,058 --> 00:16:56,024
All I did was sneak
onto your computer

391
00:16:56,026 --> 00:16:58,794
and download your Bitcoin
onto a flash drive.

392
00:16:58,796 --> 00:17:00,228
What?

393
00:17:00,230 --> 00:17:01,196
I'm not keeping it.

394
00:17:01,198 --> 00:17:03,265
I just wanted
to watch you sweat.

395
00:17:03,267 --> 00:17:04,800
If you want to watch
him sweat,

396
00:17:04,802 --> 00:17:07,336
walk up a flight
of stairs with him.

397
00:17:09,139 --> 00:17:13,342
I've waited seven long years,
but it finally happened.

398
00:17:13,344 --> 00:17:14,710
Where's our money?

399
00:17:14,712 --> 00:17:16,144
That's the best part.

400
00:17:16,146 --> 00:17:19,915
It's on the Batman flash drive
on your key chain.

401
00:17:19,917 --> 00:17:22,117
You've had it
in your pocket all along.

402
00:17:25,255 --> 00:17:27,756
Sheldon...

403
00:17:27,758 --> 00:17:30,659
I lost that key chain years ago.

404
00:17:34,231 --> 00:17:37,099
Really?

405
00:17:37,101 --> 00:17:40,669
D-D-Did you look under things?

406
00:17:42,973 --> 00:17:46,174
Well, that is unfortunate.

407
00:17:46,176 --> 00:17:48,810
I guess we've all learned
a lesson today.

408
00:17:50,714 --> 00:17:52,180
What was the lesson?

409
00:17:52,182 --> 00:17:53,515
I don't know.

410
00:18:01,517 --> 00:18:04,851
<i>Huh. What's that?</i>

411
00:18:05,243 --> 00:18:09,913
<i>Ooh, Batman flash drive.</i>

412
00:18:09,915 --> 00:18:12,715
<i>Pretty cool.</i>

413
00:18:12,717 --> 00:18:14,617
<i>Huh, if I erase this,</i>

414
00:18:14,619 --> 00:18:18,688
<i>I could probably resell it</i>
<i>for, like, ten bucks.</i>

415
00:18:18,690 --> 00:18:20,723
<i>Things are finally</i>
<i>going my way.</i>
