1
00:00:04,657 --> 00:00:05,970
WOLOWITZ:
What are you doing?

2
00:00:05,971 --> 00:00:08,772
Pigeon check for Sheldon.

3
00:00:08,774 --> 00:00:10,807
North side's all clear!

4
00:00:10,809 --> 00:00:13,110
Great. Let's look
at some planets!

5
00:00:13,112 --> 00:00:16,113
Hey, why'd you lug your
telescope all the way over here?

6
00:00:16,115 --> 00:00:17,748
Leonard has one
in our apartment.

7
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:19,483
Yeah, I'm gonna
use Leonard's.

8
00:00:19,485 --> 00:00:23,020
Might as well hold my hand
up like this and squint.

9
00:00:23,022 --> 00:00:25,556
I don't know.
It seemed pretty good.

10
00:00:25,558 --> 00:00:27,524
You know, once
when the cable went out,

11
00:00:27,526 --> 00:00:29,326
I watched an entire episode
of <i>The Bachelor</i>

12
00:00:29,328 --> 00:00:32,162
on a TV across the street.

13
00:00:32,164 --> 00:00:34,398
This one's more
of a professional model.

14
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:36,033
So was the girl he picked!

15
00:00:36,035 --> 00:00:40,837
This baby's got a ten-inch
diameter with f/10 ACF optics.

16
00:00:40,839 --> 00:00:42,272
WOLOWITZ:
And tonight

17
00:00:42,274 --> 00:00:45,175
Mercury is
at its highest elongation.

18
00:00:45,177 --> 00:00:50,747
It makes far-away things seem
close, and Mercury is a planet.

19
00:00:50,749 --> 00:00:53,617
I know Mercury is a planet.

20
00:00:53,619 --> 00:00:56,019
But the-the other
thing was helpful.

21
00:00:56,021 --> 00:00:58,422
Oh. Look at that.

22
00:00:58,424 --> 00:01:01,024
- Neil Gaiman tweeted about my store!
- What did he say?

23
00:01:01,026 --> 00:01:02,659
Uh, "Next time
you're in Pasadena,

24
00:01:02,661 --> 00:01:04,228
"check out The Comic Center.

25
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:06,029
"Great vibe,
old school,

26
00:01:06,031 --> 00:01:08,065
the owner really knows
his stuff."

27
00:01:08,067 --> 00:01:09,933
Isn't that amazing?

28
00:01:09,935 --> 00:01:12,202
Well, uh, it's no <i>Sandman,</i>
but I guess we can't expect

29
00:01:12,204 --> 00:01:14,738
everything he writes
to be a masterpiece.

30
00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:16,340
When was he in your store?

31
00:01:16,342 --> 00:01:19,209
I have no idea.
I think I would remember that.

32
00:01:19,211 --> 00:01:22,646
Obviously, vibranium is the
most powerful metal in comics.

33
00:01:22,648 --> 00:01:24,681
What, more powerful
than adamantium?

34
00:01:24,683 --> 00:01:26,283
He's right.

35
00:01:26,285 --> 00:01:28,885
Wolverine's claws,
Ultron's outer shell.

36
00:01:28,887 --> 00:01:30,354
Need I go on?

37
00:01:30,356 --> 00:01:32,889
You don't need to,
but you probably will.

38
00:01:34,093 --> 00:01:36,860
What about Wonder
Woman's bracelets?

39
00:01:36,862 --> 00:01:38,161
Good point.

40
00:01:38,163 --> 00:01:41,865
Strong as a metal and
fierce as a fashion choice.

41
00:01:41,867 --> 00:01:43,200
GAIMAN:
You know,

42
00:01:43,202 --> 00:01:44,635
Thor's hammer's
pretty powerful,

43
00:01:44,637 --> 00:01:47,471
and in the comics,
it's made out of enchanted uru.

44
00:01:47,473 --> 00:01:49,706
Uh, yeah, I think
it's the enchantment

45
00:01:49,708 --> 00:01:51,708
that's powerful,
not the uru,

46
00:01:51,710 --> 00:01:54,745
but, uh, thanks for playing.

47
00:01:56,548 --> 00:01:58,915
Oh, man, I can't believe
Neil Gaiman came in,

48
00:01:58,917 --> 00:01:59,990
and we weren't even there.

59
00:02:27,104 --> 00:02:29,705
Can you see Mercury?
Can you see it?

60
00:02:29,707 --> 00:02:31,573
One second.

61
00:02:31,575 --> 00:02:34,376
You know, the Greek
version of Mercury, Hermes,

62
00:02:34,378 --> 00:02:36,145
was worshipped
in Athens

63
00:02:36,147 --> 00:02:38,981
by the carving of
giant wooden phalluses.

64
00:02:38,983 --> 00:02:40,616
Please, Amy,

65
00:02:40,618 --> 00:02:43,352
get your mind out
of the ancient Athenian gutter.

66
00:02:44,388 --> 00:02:48,223
Got another follower.
I'm blowing up.

67
00:02:48,225 --> 00:02:49,491
Great. How many does that make?

68
00:02:49,493 --> 00:02:50,526
High double digits.

69
00:02:50,528 --> 00:02:53,028
The nineties?
Mid double digits.

70
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:54,696
KOOTHRAPPALI:
Hey, uh,

71
00:02:54,698 --> 00:02:55,797
Penny, do you want
to check this out?

72
00:02:55,821 --> 00:02:57,133
Yeah, sure.

73
00:02:57,134 --> 00:02:58,534
All right, just, uh,
look through here,

74
00:02:58,536 --> 00:03:00,736
and if you want to take a
picture, just push that button.

75
00:03:00,738 --> 00:03:02,538
Okay.

76
00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:04,039
Oh, what is that?

77
00:03:04,041 --> 00:03:06,842
(gasps) Is it Mercury? I'm really
jonesing for Mercury.

78
00:03:07,945 --> 00:03:09,111
I think it's a
little early

79
00:03:09,113 --> 00:03:10,512
for Mercury to
be visible yet.

80
00:03:10,514 --> 00:03:12,047
Playing hard to get.

81
00:03:12,049 --> 00:03:13,749
I like that in a planet.

82
00:03:15,286 --> 00:03:17,553
No, there's something fuzzy.

83
00:03:17,555 --> 00:03:20,322
Is it your teen years?

84
00:03:20,324 --> 00:03:22,324
No.

85
00:03:22,326 --> 00:03:24,226
Yes. Shut up.

86
00:03:24,228 --> 00:03:26,628
Look. Look at that.
I think I see something.

87
00:03:26,630 --> 00:03:28,397
It could just be your eyelash.

88
00:03:28,399 --> 00:03:29,765
It's not an eyelash!

89
00:03:29,767 --> 00:03:31,633
Okay, well, uh,
take a picture. Let's see.

90
00:03:31,635 --> 00:03:34,403
Okay. Here.

91
00:03:37,274 --> 00:03:40,008
Hmm. I do see something.

92
00:03:40,010 --> 00:03:41,743
(gasps) Told you.
What is it?

93
00:03:41,745 --> 00:03:43,212
I don't know.

94
00:03:43,214 --> 00:03:45,113
Maybe it's a comet.

95
00:03:45,115 --> 00:03:46,348
That would be so cool.

96
00:03:46,350 --> 00:03:47,683
STUART:
You guys want

97
00:03:47,685 --> 00:03:49,751
to see a real star,
look over here.

98
00:03:49,753 --> 00:03:51,420
What?

99
00:03:51,422 --> 00:03:56,124
I just got retweeted...
by Patton Oswalt's brother.

100
00:03:58,896 --> 00:04:01,430
(crowd chatter)

101
00:04:01,432 --> 00:04:03,599
So, this is really
where Neil Gaiman shops?

102
00:04:03,601 --> 00:04:06,568
Neil Gaiman, Nicolas Cage,
Natalie Portman.

103
00:04:06,570 --> 00:04:08,604
The list goes on.

104
00:04:08,606 --> 00:04:09,605
They all come here?

105
00:04:09,607 --> 00:04:13,075
Unless I'm lying.

106
00:04:21,385 --> 00:04:24,086
Who are all these people?

107
00:04:24,088 --> 00:04:26,355
What? Is this
a flash mob?

108
00:04:27,524 --> 00:04:29,524
Are they dancing?

109
00:04:29,526 --> 00:04:33,061
I don't know what today's
dancing looks like.

110
00:04:33,063 --> 00:04:36,098
Hey, guys. That tweet
actually got people

111
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:37,566
to come in.
Isn't that great?

112
00:04:37,568 --> 00:04:40,469
No. I liked the way
the store was before.

113
00:04:40,471 --> 00:04:42,971
You mean empty and sad?

114
00:04:42,973 --> 00:04:45,674
Yes, it was perfect.

115
00:04:45,676 --> 00:04:50,579
Like a funeral home that
sells Pok?mon cards.

116
00:04:51,915 --> 00:04:53,248
What am I supposed to do now

117
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:55,317
if I want to hang out
and read a comic book?

118
00:04:55,319 --> 00:04:56,852
Go sit on the couch.

119
00:04:58,989 --> 00:05:01,290
Next to a stranger?

120
00:05:01,292 --> 00:05:03,859
If I'm going to sit, read,
and ignore a woman,

121
00:05:03,861 --> 00:05:06,528
it's going to be my fianc?e.

122
00:05:06,530 --> 00:05:08,430
Why are you being
such a baby about the crowds?

123
00:05:08,432 --> 00:05:09,831
You go to Comic-Con.

124
00:05:09,833 --> 00:05:10,899
You-- I'm sorry.

125
00:05:10,901 --> 00:05:13,402
You're comparing this
place to Comic-Con?

126
00:05:13,404 --> 00:05:16,305
Well, can I go to the bathroom
here next to a Wookiee

127
00:05:16,307 --> 00:05:18,573
who got his zipper
stuck in his fur?

128
00:05:18,575 --> 00:05:22,377
Wow. We go to Comic-Con
for different reasons.

129
00:05:22,379 --> 00:05:24,046
You know what?

130
00:05:24,048 --> 00:05:27,215
Just give me a copy
of <i>Action Comics</i> 1000,

131
00:05:27,217 --> 00:05:28,750
and I'll be on my way.

132
00:05:28,752 --> 00:05:30,018
Sorry. All out.

133
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:33,622
Now you just let people
come in and buy them?

134
00:05:33,624 --> 00:05:37,192
I didn't realize
your soul was also for sale.

135
00:05:37,194 --> 00:05:38,360
STUART:
Well,

136
00:05:38,362 --> 00:05:41,830
it wasn't,
but, uh, make me an offer.

137
00:05:44,101 --> 00:05:46,101
(phone chimes)
Who is that?

138
00:05:46,103 --> 00:05:48,036
Sheldon.
Who is he mad at?

139
00:05:48,038 --> 00:05:49,471
Neil Gaiman.
Who's that?

140
00:05:49,473 --> 00:05:51,707
Not us.
Great.

141
00:05:52,676 --> 00:05:54,476
(knocking)
Guys.

142
00:05:54,478 --> 00:05:55,777
Hi.
Hey.

143
00:05:55,779 --> 00:05:56,878
So, guess what.

144
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:00,549
That indeed was
a comet last night,

145
00:06:00,551 --> 00:06:02,684
and it turns out,
no one's seen it before.

146
00:06:02,686 --> 00:06:04,186
(laughing): Wow.
Really?

147
00:06:04,188 --> 00:06:07,022
Look at that!
I discovered a comet! Oh!

148
00:06:07,024 --> 00:06:09,157
What do you mean
<i>you</i> discovered it?

149
00:06:09,159 --> 00:06:10,726
Well, I'm the one who saw it.

150
00:06:10,728 --> 00:06:13,095
In my telescope
that I positioned.

151
00:06:13,097 --> 00:06:14,763
All you did was look into it.

152
00:06:14,765 --> 00:06:16,765
Well, you both discovered it.

153
00:06:16,767 --> 00:06:19,134
You can put both your names
on the registration form.

154
00:06:19,136 --> 00:06:21,203
Actually, we can't.
Why not?

155
00:06:21,205 --> 00:06:23,372
Because when I filled it out,
it asked for name of discoverer,

156
00:06:23,374 --> 00:06:26,274
and I put
"Rajesh Koothrappali" because...

157
00:06:26,276 --> 00:06:29,878
because that's who I am,
and that's what I did.

158
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:31,179
Are you kidding me?

159
00:06:31,181 --> 00:06:33,815
Well, he is the one
who knew it was a comet.

160
00:06:33,817 --> 00:06:36,118
No, he didn't.
He thought it was an eyelash!

161
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:38,286
And you thought
it was a fuzzy streak.

162
00:06:38,288 --> 00:06:40,756
I mean, do you even know
what a comet is?

163
00:06:40,758 --> 00:06:42,657
Yeah, the thing I saw first.

164
00:06:42,659 --> 00:06:46,495
I honestly don't think that
that qualifies as a discovery.

165
00:06:46,497 --> 00:06:47,696
But I took the picture.

166
00:06:47,698 --> 00:06:48,797
Because I told you to!

167
00:06:48,799 --> 00:06:50,532
Like, if a monkey
took the picture,

168
00:06:50,534 --> 00:06:51,700
did it discover the comet?

169
00:06:51,702 --> 00:06:55,570
Excuse me?!

170
00:06:55,572 --> 00:06:58,006
(stammering):
Uh, he didn't mean monkey.

171
00:06:58,008 --> 00:07:00,208
- Get the hell out of my apartment!
- And she didn't mean that.

172
00:07:00,210 --> 00:07:02,711
Actually, I think she did.
You should go.

173
00:07:05,249 --> 00:07:07,215
You look great.

174
00:07:07,217 --> 00:07:08,683
Oh, thanks.

175
00:07:08,685 --> 00:07:10,385
Would you believe
this is actually a dress

176
00:07:10,387 --> 00:07:11,586
from before I was pregnant?

177
00:07:11,588 --> 00:07:12,821
Well, it's not a competition,

178
00:07:12,823 --> 00:07:16,191
but I wore this suit
to my Bar Mitzvah.

179
00:07:16,193 --> 00:07:17,659
Where's Stuart?

180
00:07:17,661 --> 00:07:19,594
I told him
we had a 6:30 reservation.

181
00:07:19,596 --> 00:07:21,329
Well, I'll call him.

182
00:07:21,331 --> 00:07:23,732
(ringtone plays)

183
00:07:23,734 --> 00:07:27,102
Comic Center,
where the real superhero is you.

184
00:07:27,104 --> 00:07:28,837
Stuart, you're supposed
to be babysitting.

185
00:07:28,839 --> 00:07:30,071
Oh!

186
00:07:30,073 --> 00:07:32,140
Shoot. That was tonight.
I forgot.

187
00:07:32,142 --> 00:07:33,642
The store's been really busy.

188
00:07:33,644 --> 00:07:36,144
Well, when can you get here?

189
00:07:36,146 --> 00:07:38,180
Um, I don't think I can.
Listen to this.

190
00:07:38,182 --> 00:07:40,749
I-I was ringing up a customer,
and I heard someone say,

191
00:07:40,751 --> 00:07:43,819
"Hey, there's a line,"
and I looked, and there was.

192
00:07:44,655 --> 00:07:47,255
Come on. You can't
do this to us.

193
00:07:47,257 --> 00:07:49,591
I am really sorry. I
will make it up to you.

194
00:07:49,593 --> 00:07:52,294
But it won't be with
a Val Kilmer Batman figurine

195
00:07:52,296 --> 00:07:54,729
(laughing): because some sucker's
buying that right now.

196
00:07:54,731 --> 00:07:55,897
(laughs)

197
00:07:55,899 --> 00:07:58,667
Not you. This is great.

198
00:07:59,570 --> 00:08:01,736
He says he has to work.

199
00:08:01,738 --> 00:08:02,938
Oh, it's okay.

200
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:04,439
We can have date night
another night.

201
00:08:04,441 --> 00:08:06,174
But you got all dressed up.

202
00:08:06,176 --> 00:08:09,277
We were supposed to have
dinner and romance.

203
00:08:09,279 --> 00:08:11,279
We'll just have
to divide and conquer.

204
00:08:11,281 --> 00:08:12,481
I'll go to dinner,

205
00:08:12,483 --> 00:08:15,317
and you can stay home with
the Internet and have romance.

206
00:08:18,222 --> 00:08:19,921
Okay, look, I Googled it.

207
00:08:19,923 --> 00:08:22,157
I took the picture,
so it's my discovery. (scoffs)

208
00:08:22,159 --> 00:08:23,625
He stole my comet.

209
00:08:23,627 --> 00:08:26,127
I know, but on the other hand,
do you really care?

210
00:08:26,129 --> 00:08:28,463
Yes, I care.
This happens to me all the time.

211
00:08:28,465 --> 00:08:29,831
People take one look at me

212
00:08:29,833 --> 00:08:31,666
and assume I don't know
what I'm talking about.

213
00:08:31,668 --> 00:08:33,034
Oh, I'm sure that's not true.

214
00:08:33,036 --> 00:08:34,202
I'm sorry. Are you saying

215
00:08:34,204 --> 00:08:36,304
I don't know
what I'm talking about?

216
00:08:36,306 --> 00:08:39,674
No, I'm not saying anything...
ever again.

217
00:08:39,676 --> 00:08:41,643
Look, I'm serious.
The other day at work,

218
00:08:41,645 --> 00:08:44,546
I had this great idea, but
no one was listening to me.

219
00:08:44,548 --> 00:08:46,848
And then five minutes later,
Paul said the same thing,

220
00:08:46,850 --> 00:08:48,717
and they practically
carried him around the room.

221
00:08:48,719 --> 00:08:49,851
Oh, well, what was it?

222
00:08:49,853 --> 00:08:51,453
Well, CPK for lunch,

223
00:08:51,455 --> 00:08:53,889
but that's just one example.

224
00:08:53,891 --> 00:08:55,023
It also happens
with all

225
00:08:55,025 --> 00:08:56,324
the doctors I have to deal with.

226
00:08:56,326 --> 00:08:57,626
You know,
they're so condescending.

227
00:08:57,628 --> 00:08:59,261
I'm so sick
of letting this stuff slide.

228
00:08:59,263 --> 00:09:01,997
I found that comet. Why should
I let Raj say he found it?

229
00:09:01,999 --> 00:09:03,598
I know you're right,
but he is our friend,

230
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,433
and this could be good
for his career.

231
00:09:05,435 --> 00:09:08,336
Okay, so you agree with me,
but he still gets his way?

232
00:09:08,338 --> 00:09:10,639
Ah, there you go.
Everybody wins.

233
00:09:10,641 --> 00:09:12,874
My God, you're such
a people-pleaser.

234
00:09:12,876 --> 00:09:14,376
You can't stand
making anyone angry.

235
00:09:14,378 --> 00:09:16,378
Why would I want
to make anyone angry?

236
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:18,146
'Cause it would mean
you were on my side.

237
00:09:18,148 --> 00:09:20,549
Oh, I am on your side.
Hey, hey.

238
00:09:20,551 --> 00:09:24,119
Let's not forget who
you're really mad at here-- Raj.

239
00:09:24,121 --> 00:09:27,188
Oh, and Paul.
Paul sucks, right?

240
00:09:28,759 --> 00:09:31,493
But don't tell him I said that.

241
00:09:32,629 --> 00:09:35,997
Hey, Howard,
did you see that...?

242
00:09:35,999 --> 00:09:38,166
(shrieks)

243
00:09:42,606 --> 00:09:44,940
I'm over here, Sheldon.

244
00:09:46,710 --> 00:09:48,677
That was a close one.

245
00:09:48,679 --> 00:09:51,079
I almost went home
with that guy.

246
00:09:51,081 --> 00:09:54,149
You doing okay?
Do we need to go?

247
00:09:54,151 --> 00:09:56,017
No, I'm fine.

248
00:09:56,019 --> 00:09:59,054
I admit all these people did
take me by surprise at first,

249
00:09:59,056 --> 00:10:01,623
but I've learned
that I can accept change.

250
00:10:01,625 --> 00:10:03,792
S-Since when?

251
00:10:04,728 --> 00:10:06,795
I managed it when Amy
switched her shampoo

252
00:10:06,797 --> 00:10:09,264
from Prell
to Prell for oily hair. Hmm?

253
00:10:09,266 --> 00:10:10,865
Although I do miss the way

254
00:10:10,867 --> 00:10:13,702
her head used
to slide off the pillow.

255
00:10:18,942 --> 00:10:20,542
May I help you?

256
00:10:20,544 --> 00:10:21,943
Who are you?

257
00:10:21,945 --> 00:10:24,346
Oh, I'm Denise,
the new assistant manager.

258
00:10:24,348 --> 00:10:26,014
Nope.

259
00:10:31,651 --> 00:10:34,318
Can you believe it?
In the past decade,

260
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,587
I have spent thousands
of dollars in that store,

261
00:10:36,589 --> 00:10:38,322
and this is the thanks I get.

262
00:10:38,324 --> 00:10:41,826
You're right. I mean,
he could at least get you a mug.

263
00:10:42,662 --> 00:10:44,028
He gave me a mug.

264
00:10:44,030 --> 00:10:46,230
What do you think
I'm drinking out of?

265
00:10:46,866 --> 00:10:49,066
Do you even pay attention?

266
00:10:49,068 --> 00:10:51,369
Honestly, less and less.

267
00:10:52,605 --> 00:10:55,239
Amy, the comic
book store

268
00:10:55,241 --> 00:10:58,843
is like my version
of the country in <i>Black Panther.</i>

269
00:10:58,845 --> 00:11:01,445
Okay, I'm afraid this is
gonna get really offensive

270
00:11:01,447 --> 00:11:02,980
to certain groups.

271
00:11:05,418 --> 00:11:08,085
The nation of Wakanda
was a hidden gem,

272
00:11:08,087 --> 00:11:10,388
and they wanted to
keep it that way,

273
00:11:10,390 --> 00:11:13,524
because they knew if they
opened it up to the world,

274
00:11:13,526 --> 00:11:16,694
everything that was special
about it would get ruined.

275
00:11:16,696 --> 00:11:18,929
Are you done?
Yes.

276
00:11:18,931 --> 00:11:21,532
(relieved sigh):
Oh, okay.

277
00:11:21,534 --> 00:11:24,301
That both made sense
<i>and</i> wasn't offensive.

278
00:11:25,505 --> 00:11:28,539
And to make things worse,
Stuart hired some woman.

279
00:11:28,541 --> 00:11:31,108
There we go.
No...

280
00:11:31,110 --> 00:11:33,244
I'm not annoyed
that she's a woman.

281
00:11:33,246 --> 00:11:35,312
I'm annoyed, and
she's a woman.

282
00:11:35,314 --> 00:11:36,747
No, I get that.

283
00:11:36,749 --> 00:11:39,650
I'm annoyed and <i>I'm</i> a woman.

284
00:11:40,887 --> 00:11:43,020
It's just, Stuart knows
my likes and dislikes.

285
00:11:43,022 --> 00:11:45,189
And I can count
on his discretion

286
00:11:45,191 --> 00:11:47,224
if I pick up the
occasional back issue

287
00:11:47,226 --> 00:11:49,960
of <i>Superman's Pal</i>
<i>Jimmy Olsen.</i>

288
00:11:51,497 --> 00:11:54,031
Which I don't.

289
00:11:54,033 --> 00:11:57,034
Well, don't think of her
as a stranger.

290
00:11:57,036 --> 00:11:59,236
Just think of her as a...

291
00:11:59,238 --> 00:12:04,108
a friend you haven't berated,
lectured or condescended to yet.

292
00:12:04,110 --> 00:12:06,911
I hadn't thought
of it that way.

293
00:12:06,913 --> 00:12:08,345
Thank you.

294
00:12:08,347 --> 00:12:10,748
You're welcome.
You're wise,

295
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:12,716
and you smell like books.

296
00:12:14,987 --> 00:12:16,854
You really are
the whole package.

297
00:12:20,827 --> 00:12:22,493
Raj, just help me out.

298
00:12:22,495 --> 00:12:24,595
Penny's pretty mad
about this comet thing.

299
00:12:24,597 --> 00:12:26,197
Well, I'm sorry she's upset.

300
00:12:26,199 --> 00:12:28,432
But she didn't discover it.
Oh, come on,

301
00:12:28,434 --> 00:12:30,167
you know she was a part of it.

302
00:12:30,169 --> 00:12:31,869
Just add her name
to the registration.

303
00:12:31,871 --> 00:12:34,138
But I already told
everyone at work that I did it.

304
00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:35,272
My boss was so excited,

305
00:12:35,274 --> 00:12:36,874
he started calling me
Captain Comet.

306
00:12:36,876 --> 00:12:38,409
Which is better

307
00:12:38,411 --> 00:12:41,445
than his last nickname for me:
Dr. Doughnuts.

308
00:12:41,447 --> 00:12:43,781
Because one time
I had two doughnuts.

309
00:12:43,783 --> 00:12:46,417
And two times
I had three doughnuts.

310
00:12:47,787 --> 00:12:50,855
I guess you're just gonna
have to swallow your pride.

311
00:12:50,857 --> 00:12:52,923
I, I, I can't do that.

312
00:12:52,925 --> 00:12:56,827
Sure you can-- just pretend
it's two or three doughnuts.

313
00:12:56,829 --> 00:12:58,162
You don't understand.

314
00:12:58,164 --> 00:12:59,830
Leonard, I need this.

315
00:12:59,832 --> 00:13:01,098
My last big discovery was:

316
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:03,300
if you press
your upper lip hard enough,

317
00:13:03,302 --> 00:13:06,036
you can block a sneeze.

318
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:09,573
<i>I</i> told you that.

319
00:13:09,575 --> 00:13:11,742
(groans)
This is all my fault.

320
00:13:11,744 --> 00:13:14,144
I brought this
upon myself.

321
00:13:14,146 --> 00:13:16,447
(smacks lips)
I'm a bad scientist.

322
00:13:16,449 --> 00:13:18,549
I'm a selfish person.
No, no,

323
00:13:18,551 --> 00:13:19,617
don't get upset.

324
00:13:19,619 --> 00:13:20,918
You're not a bad person.

325
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:22,987
Just let me... talk to Penny.

326
00:13:22,989 --> 00:13:24,088
I'm-I'm sure I can

327
00:13:24,090 --> 00:13:25,656
make her understand.

328
00:13:25,658 --> 00:13:28,058
Thank you. You're
a good friend, Leonard.

329
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:31,629
I'm glad you think so,
'cause I may be living here soon.

330
00:13:39,105 --> 00:13:41,505
Just look at her
over there.

331
00:13:41,507 --> 00:13:43,107
She just started,

332
00:13:43,109 --> 00:13:44,775
and she gets to
put up "Staff Picks."

333
00:13:44,777 --> 00:13:46,310
I've been coming here
for ten years--

334
00:13:46,312 --> 00:13:48,979
I still can't put up
"Sheldon Dislikes."

335
00:13:48,981 --> 00:13:50,481
I talked to her yesterday.

336
00:13:50,483 --> 00:13:52,983
She really seems
to know her stuff.

337
00:13:53,819 --> 00:13:55,686
Challenge accepted.

338
00:13:55,688 --> 00:13:58,689
That is not what that was.

339
00:13:59,525 --> 00:14:01,325
Excuse me.

340
00:14:01,327 --> 00:14:02,993
I was wondering

341
00:14:02,995 --> 00:14:04,328
if you could recommend
something.

342
00:14:04,330 --> 00:14:06,163
Oh, sure. You want
to tell me what you like?

343
00:14:06,165 --> 00:14:07,965
I would not.

344
00:14:11,771 --> 00:14:15,472
All right, well, you're
wearing a Green Lantern shirt,

345
00:14:15,474 --> 00:14:17,107
so I'm guessing
you're a DC fan.

346
00:14:17,109 --> 00:14:18,876
Although that's from
the Alan Scott era,

347
00:14:18,878 --> 00:14:20,711
so you're probably not
super into the current run.

348
00:14:20,713 --> 00:14:23,013
How would you feel about
an alternate history

349
00:14:23,015 --> 00:14:26,016
where World War I was fought
with dragons and magic?

350
00:14:26,018 --> 00:14:27,618
That's what I wanted the theme

351
00:14:27,620 --> 00:14:29,720
of my tenth birthday party
to be!

352
00:14:29,722 --> 00:14:31,055
Here.

353
00:14:31,057 --> 00:14:32,957
Check this out.

354
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:35,559
It's by Kurt Busiek.
GAIMAN: You know, if you're interested

355
00:14:35,561 --> 00:14:36,994
in alternate histories,

356
00:14:36,996 --> 00:14:39,396
Neil Gaiman wrote one
called <i>1602.</i>

357
00:14:39,398 --> 00:14:42,533
I'm sorry, we're in the middle
of something here.

358
00:14:44,503 --> 00:14:45,703
It is pretty good, actually.

359
00:14:45,705 --> 00:14:46,937
He takes
the Marvel superheroes

360
00:14:46,939 --> 00:14:49,373
and he puts them
into Elizabethan England.

361
00:14:49,375 --> 00:14:53,777
Let me guess-- everyone thinks
the X-Men are witches.

362
00:14:54,614 --> 00:14:55,879
Yeah.

363
00:14:58,417 --> 00:15:01,218
Why don't you take this home,
and if you don't like it,

364
00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:03,187
return it and I'll give
you your money back.

365
00:15:03,189 --> 00:15:04,288
Just don't tell Stuart.

366
00:15:04,290 --> 00:15:06,657
Stuart who?

367
00:15:09,629 --> 00:15:10,761
Hey.

368
00:15:10,763 --> 00:15:14,231
Where have you been?
I went to yell at Raj.

369
00:15:14,233 --> 00:15:16,900
And? Is he gonna
give me back my comet?

370
00:15:16,902 --> 00:15:18,702
Interesting thing.

371
00:15:18,704 --> 00:15:20,504
Did you cave?

372
00:15:20,506 --> 00:15:21,939
Maybe I did, or...

373
00:15:21,941 --> 00:15:23,874
maybe I did.

374
00:15:25,444 --> 00:15:27,444
But I did realize something.

375
00:15:27,446 --> 00:15:30,481
I-I don't need
to fight your battles.

376
00:15:30,483 --> 00:15:31,782
You... you are

377
00:15:31,784 --> 00:15:33,317
a strong and independent woman.

378
00:15:33,319 --> 00:15:35,052
You have your own voice.

379
00:15:35,054 --> 00:15:36,920
And, to quote
another strong woman,

380
00:15:36,922 --> 00:15:39,823
Katy Perry,
it's time to hear you roar.

381
00:15:39,825 --> 00:15:43,260
Did you just think of that
on your way home?

382
00:15:43,262 --> 00:15:45,996
What do you want from me?
The song was on in the car.

383
00:15:45,998 --> 00:15:47,398
But it doesn't mean

384
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:49,199
that it's not true.

385
00:15:49,201 --> 00:15:50,868
Well, you make a good point.

386
00:15:50,870 --> 00:15:53,103
I'm gonna go talk to Raj myself.

387
00:15:54,006 --> 00:15:55,973
I know I don't say it enough,

388
00:15:55,975 --> 00:15:58,175
but you go, girl.

389
00:15:58,177 --> 00:16:01,111
That was enough.

390
00:16:03,449 --> 00:16:05,449
What's all this?

391
00:16:05,451 --> 00:16:07,618
Well, we missed
our date night,

392
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:09,987
and Stuart's working again,
so I thought we could have

393
00:16:09,989 --> 00:16:11,622
a date night here at home.

394
00:16:11,624 --> 00:16:13,457
(clicks tongue)
Aw, that's so sweet.

395
00:16:13,459 --> 00:16:16,126
Oh. So... is that
really what you're wearing

396
00:16:16,128 --> 00:16:18,162
to our date night?

397
00:16:18,164 --> 00:16:21,932
Well, Stuart's not here
and the kids are sleeping.

398
00:16:21,934 --> 00:16:23,901
I could wear nothing.

399
00:16:23,903 --> 00:16:25,969
You might want
to hold off on that--

400
00:16:25,971 --> 00:16:28,005
we're starting with soup.

401
00:16:28,007 --> 00:16:29,373
(laughs)

402
00:16:29,375 --> 00:16:31,108
Hey!

403
00:16:31,110 --> 00:16:33,410
Wha...? I thought you
were working late again.

404
00:16:33,412 --> 00:16:35,245
I was, but Denise
has got it covered.

405
00:16:35,247 --> 00:16:36,380
Oh.
Oh...

406
00:16:36,382 --> 00:16:37,848
the funniest thing
happened today.

407
00:16:37,850 --> 00:16:41,051
You know the, uh, receipt tape
in the cash register?

408
00:16:41,053 --> 00:16:42,252
It ran out.

409
00:16:42,254 --> 00:16:43,320
(chuckles)

410
00:16:43,322 --> 00:16:45,322
I didn't even know
it could do that.

411
00:16:46,692 --> 00:16:48,587
You know, we were just
sitting down to dinner.

412
00:16:48,611 --> 00:16:49,728
Oh. Perfect timing.

413
00:16:49,729 --> 00:16:51,195
I'll go wash up.

414
00:16:52,531 --> 00:16:54,465
There goes date night.

415
00:16:54,467 --> 00:16:56,633
Are you kidding?
Stuart's here! Get your purse.

416
00:16:56,635 --> 00:16:58,836
We're going out.
What about the dinner you made?

417
00:16:58,838 --> 00:17:00,671
Right. Hey, Stuart!

418
00:17:00,673 --> 00:17:03,841
That can of soup
sitting by the stove, that's for you!

419
00:17:03,843 --> 00:17:06,176
You made canned soup
for date night?

420
00:17:06,178 --> 00:17:07,845
And you wore sweatpants.
Let's go.

421
00:17:11,217 --> 00:17:14,785
Oh, <i>and</i> it turns out Denise
is also really excited

422
00:17:14,787 --> 00:17:16,620
for Dan Slott's run
on <i>Iron Man,</i>

423
00:17:16,622 --> 00:17:19,289
because he was her favorite
Spider-Man writer, too.

424
00:17:19,291 --> 00:17:21,892
How about that?

425
00:17:21,894 --> 00:17:26,130
Oh! And guess who goes to art school
right here in Pasadena.

426
00:17:26,132 --> 00:17:27,598
Hmm. I don't know.

427
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:29,800
Denise?

428
00:17:30,903 --> 00:17:33,103
You're a good guesser, Amy.

429
00:17:33,105 --> 00:17:35,472
Not as good
as Denise, though.

430
00:17:35,474 --> 00:17:37,641
She thought I would like
this comic, <i>Arrowsmith,</i>

431
00:17:37,643 --> 00:17:41,245
and she was right.
Well, was the store crowded?

432
00:17:41,247 --> 00:17:42,980
I bet it was.
I know you hate that.

433
00:17:42,982 --> 00:17:45,048
It was. But if it
weren't for the crowds,

434
00:17:45,050 --> 00:17:47,117
Stuart never would
have hired Denise,

435
00:17:47,119 --> 00:17:48,519
and she's the best.

436
00:17:53,359 --> 00:17:54,858
You must be Denise.

437
00:17:54,860 --> 00:17:56,727
Oh, yeah. How
can I help you?

438
00:17:56,729 --> 00:17:58,762
I'm Amy, Sheldon's fianc?e.

439
00:17:58,764 --> 00:18:00,597
Oh. I got to be honest,

440
00:18:00,599 --> 00:18:03,600
I wasn't a hundred percent
sure you were real.

441
00:18:05,271 --> 00:18:08,772
Oh, I am. And I heard you and
Sheldon had a great time today

442
00:18:08,774 --> 00:18:10,140
talking about comic books.

443
00:18:10,142 --> 00:18:11,475
We did.
Great.

444
00:18:11,477 --> 00:18:13,644
Here's what's gonna happen.

445
00:18:13,646 --> 00:18:15,312
You're gonna teach me
how to do that.

446
00:18:15,314 --> 00:18:16,446
Do what?

447
00:18:16,448 --> 00:18:18,315
Pretend to like comic books.

448
00:18:18,317 --> 00:18:20,751
Oh, no, I actually
like comic books.

449
00:18:20,753 --> 00:18:22,519
All right, let's not get
hung up on semantics.

450
00:18:22,521 --> 00:18:24,588
It's late, we got
a lot of work to do.

451
00:18:27,293 --> 00:18:30,494
(loud footsteps approaching)

452
00:18:32,131 --> 00:18:33,730
(knocking)

453
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:36,767
I'm sorry.

454
00:18:36,769 --> 00:18:38,435
I haven't even said
anything yet.

455
00:18:38,437 --> 00:18:40,771
I know, but I heard your
footsteps coming up the stairs,

456
00:18:40,773 --> 00:18:42,272
and they sounded angry.

457
00:18:42,274 --> 00:18:45,309
They are angry.
I'm mad at you.

458
00:18:45,311 --> 00:18:47,077
And you have every
right to be, okay?

459
00:18:47,079 --> 00:18:48,745
I was being...
I was being a jerk.

460
00:18:48,747 --> 00:18:52,416
We did this together, and
I hogged all of the credit.

461
00:18:52,418 --> 00:18:55,886
And after you've been such a good friend
to me over the years.

462
00:18:55,888 --> 00:18:59,256
Like, I wouldn't even be able to talk
to women if it wasn't for you, so...

463
00:18:59,258 --> 00:19:02,759
so I'm... I'm gonna make sure
that your name is on the comet.

464
00:19:02,761 --> 00:19:04,094
Thank you.

465
00:19:04,096 --> 00:19:06,964
Even if it's
professionally embarrassing.

466
00:19:06,966 --> 00:19:11,168
You know, or maybe put me
on thin ice at work.

467
00:19:11,170 --> 00:19:13,570
I may lose my funding.

468
00:19:13,572 --> 00:19:17,174
I still, uh...
still want to make this right.

469
00:19:17,176 --> 00:19:19,676
Good. Bye.

470
00:19:22,229 --> 00:19:25,796
That worked way better
with Leonard.

471
00:19:30,690 --> 00:19:32,824
(door opens)

472
00:19:32,826 --> 00:19:35,593
- Hello.
- Hi.

473
00:19:36,163 --> 00:19:38,630
Why are you reading
a comic book?

474
00:19:38,632 --> 00:19:40,666
Denise recommended it to me.

475
00:19:40,668 --> 00:19:42,301
It's the <i>Rebirth Omnibus.</i>

476
00:19:42,303 --> 00:19:45,070
She thought it would be
a good entry point for me

477
00:19:45,072 --> 00:19:47,139
into the DC Universe--
and I have to say,

478
00:19:47,141 --> 00:19:48,114
- I really do like...
- You know, Amy,

479
00:19:48,115 --> 00:19:50,345
Amy, I've talked a lot about
comic books lately,

480
00:19:50,369 --> 00:19:51,690
can we talk about something else?
