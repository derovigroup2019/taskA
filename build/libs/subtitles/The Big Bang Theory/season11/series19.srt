1
00:00:03,061 --> 00:00:04,728
Why are you wearing
a Band-Aid?

2
00:00:04,730 --> 00:00:05,995
Halley bit me.

3
00:00:05,997 --> 00:00:08,932
You got beaten up by a girl.

4
00:00:08,934 --> 00:00:11,101
Hey, that's sexist.

5
00:00:11,103 --> 00:00:12,268
You're right.

6
00:00:12,270 --> 00:00:15,138
You got beaten up by a <i>baby.</i>

7
00:00:16,108 --> 00:00:18,441
- Hi. - Hey.
- Hey.

8
00:00:18,443 --> 00:00:20,143
What you got there?
Oh, I grabbed a sandwich

9
00:00:20,145 --> 00:00:21,644
at the food truck
out front.

10
00:00:21,646 --> 00:00:23,513
Wait, n-now, hold on.

11
00:00:23,515 --> 00:00:24,748
Tonight is Friday,

12
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:26,316
and I believe you know
what that means.

13
00:00:26,318 --> 00:00:29,419
That my fun, young life took
a drastic turn somewhere?

14
00:00:30,288 --> 00:00:31,488
No.

15
00:00:31,490 --> 00:00:33,523
But yeah.

16
00:00:33,525 --> 00:00:36,493
No, that means it's
Chinese food night.

17
00:00:36,495 --> 00:00:38,661
Yeah, and you have Chinese food.
So eat it.

18
00:00:38,663 --> 00:00:41,598
But I can smell your pastrami.

19
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:42,799
And we can all hear
your complaining,

20
00:00:42,801 --> 00:00:43,967
so no one's happy.

21
00:00:45,070 --> 00:00:46,636
It does smell good.

22
00:00:46,638 --> 00:00:47,937
Oh, it is.
I had one the other day.

23
00:00:47,939 --> 00:00:49,539
What is happening?

24
00:00:49,541 --> 00:00:51,808
Everybody's supposed to be
eating Chinese food.

25
00:00:51,810 --> 00:00:53,510
Well, actually,
I believe the Chinese

26
00:00:53,512 --> 00:00:54,911
may have invented
the sandwich.

27
00:00:54,913 --> 00:00:57,180
Their dish “rou jia mo”
literally means

28
00:00:57,182 --> 00:00:58,982
“meat between bread.”

29
00:00:58,984 --> 00:01:00,750
So, it looks like all
of us, including Penny,

30
00:01:00,752 --> 00:01:02,318
are eating Chinese food.

31
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:05,121
Except for you, Sheldon.
You're eating crow.

32
00:01:06,458 --> 00:01:08,091
I'm sorry, I think
you're forgetting

33
00:01:08,093 --> 00:01:09,993
that the sandwich
was invented

34
00:01:09,995 --> 00:01:13,096
by John Montagu,
the Earl of Sandwich.

35
00:01:13,098 --> 00:01:15,331
Oh. The truck's called
“Pearl of Sandwich.”

36
00:01:15,333 --> 00:01:17,033
Now I get it.

37
00:01:17,035 --> 00:01:21,004
All right, that smells too good.
I got to get one of those.

38
00:01:21,006 --> 00:01:24,174
And I think you're forgetting
that there are written documents

39
00:01:24,176 --> 00:01:26,743
of meat between bread
being eaten in China

40
00:01:26,745 --> 00:01:28,578
during the Tang dynasty.

41
00:01:28,580 --> 00:01:29,846
You know what,
I'll go with you.

42
00:01:29,848 --> 00:01:32,015
And then maybe we just go home.

43
00:01:32,017 --> 00:01:35,485
I think you're defining
bread very loosely.

44
00:01:35,487 --> 00:01:37,153
If we go down that road,
where does it end?

45
00:01:37,155 --> 00:01:39,122
Well, I would say
when we go to bed,

46
00:01:39,124 --> 00:01:41,257
but you talk
in your sleep.

47
00:01:41,259 --> 00:01:43,092
I don't want to get into this
with you right now.

48
00:01:43,094 --> 00:01:45,528
We'll talk about this
when I'm asleep.

49
00:01:46,798 --> 00:01:49,265
I don't want to talk
about it when you're asleep.

50
00:01:49,267 --> 00:01:51,100
How come we can't
talk about it now?

51
00:01:51,102 --> 00:01:52,502
Well, because I'm eating now.

52
00:01:52,504 --> 00:01:54,971
Fine. How's your moo shu?

53
00:01:54,973 --> 00:01:57,240
You know what?
It's great.

54
00:01:57,242 --> 00:01:59,709
Wait, look at that.

55
00:01:59,711 --> 00:02:03,246
Hmm. Well, maybe the Chinese
did invent the sandwich.

56
00:02:05,050 --> 00:02:06,783
I guess you were right.

57
00:02:08,453 --> 00:02:10,887
Too bad no one's
around to hear it.

58
00:02:31,802 --> 00:02:35,802

60
00:02:37,904 --> 00:02:41,706
I can smell that food truck
from up here.

61
00:02:41,707 --> 00:02:44,074
Just close the window
if you don't like the smell.

62
00:02:44,076 --> 00:02:46,310
Of course I like the smell.

63
00:02:46,312 --> 00:02:48,078
It's salt and fat.

64
00:02:49,281 --> 00:02:51,682
My brain may be evolved,
but my tongue still wants

65
00:02:51,684 --> 00:02:55,052
to pick up a club and drag
that truck back to my cave.

66
00:02:55,054 --> 00:02:56,787
So, there's something
you like,

67
00:02:56,789 --> 00:03:00,090
but it's also
driving you crazy.

68
00:03:00,092 --> 00:03:01,792
Been there, doing it now.

69
00:03:03,395 --> 00:03:05,429
No, it-it's a distraction.

70
00:03:05,431 --> 00:03:06,830
How can I focus on my work

71
00:03:06,832 --> 00:03:09,099
when all I can think about is
how much I want that sandwich?

72
00:03:09,101 --> 00:03:10,567
So, go get one.

73
00:03:10,569 --> 00:03:12,102
I can't just give in
to every urge I have

74
00:03:12,104 --> 00:03:13,103
when I have it.

75
00:03:13,105 --> 00:03:15,172
That's why I have
a rigid schedule.

76
00:03:15,174 --> 00:03:16,807
It's bad enough I had to
give in to my urge

77
00:03:16,809 --> 00:03:19,276
to create a rigid schedule.

78
00:03:19,278 --> 00:03:22,045
You know, why don't I just
go down to the food truck

79
00:03:22,047 --> 00:03:24,181
and ask them to move?

80
00:03:24,183 --> 00:03:26,783
- Why are you taking cash?
- No reason.

81
00:03:31,290 --> 00:03:34,791
Oh, this is the life.

82
00:03:34,793 --> 00:03:36,159
What could be better than this?

83
00:03:36,161 --> 00:03:39,796
If you weren't wearing
one of my swimsuits.

84
00:03:39,798 --> 00:03:41,832
I'll give it back.

85
00:03:41,834 --> 00:03:43,633
You know the rule...

86
00:03:43,635 --> 00:03:48,105
once it touches hiney,
it's no longer miney.

87
00:03:48,107 --> 00:03:50,007
You're such a prude.

88
00:03:50,009 --> 00:03:52,309
Do you know all the things
this water's touching right now?

89
00:03:52,311 --> 00:03:54,277
Well, I'm relaxed enough.

90
00:03:57,649 --> 00:03:59,416
Hey, Howard, look.

91
00:03:59,418 --> 00:04:01,251
What's that?

92
00:04:01,253 --> 00:04:03,620
Huh.

93
00:04:03,622 --> 00:04:05,922
Looks like someone's drone.

94
00:04:05,924 --> 00:04:07,324
Oh, no.

95
00:04:07,326 --> 00:04:09,192
Do you think it was spying on us
in the hot tub?

96
00:04:09,194 --> 00:04:12,729
'Cause I'm only 40% of the way
to my beach bod.

97
00:04:12,731 --> 00:04:14,731
One of the propellers
is broken.

98
00:04:14,733 --> 00:04:16,299
It must have crashed.

99
00:04:16,301 --> 00:04:18,435
Oh. Do you think
you could fix it?

100
00:04:18,437 --> 00:04:21,605
Maybe. Should we try and
track down the owner first?

101
00:04:21,607 --> 00:04:24,341
Yeah, that's probably
a good idea.

102
00:04:24,343 --> 00:04:26,343
Anyone lose a drone?

103
00:04:28,147 --> 00:04:29,279
Looks like it's ours.

104
00:04:29,281 --> 00:04:31,181
Yay, we got a drone!
Shh.

105
00:04:31,183 --> 00:04:34,451
Oh.
Yay, we got a drone.

106
00:04:38,824 --> 00:04:41,792
The pastrami truck moved.

107
00:04:43,429 --> 00:04:47,364
That is the danger
of a restaurant on wheels.

108
00:04:47,366 --> 00:04:49,666
No, apparently someone
complained

109
00:04:49,668 --> 00:04:50,934
to the tenants association,

110
00:04:50,936 --> 00:04:52,636
and they're not allowed to park
on our street anymore.

111
00:04:52,638 --> 00:04:55,272
Who would complain about
something that everyone loves?

112
00:04:55,274 --> 00:04:57,140
Oh...

113
00:04:57,142 --> 00:04:59,443
Did you complain
to the tenants association

114
00:04:59,445 --> 00:05:00,444
about the food truck?

115
00:05:00,446 --> 00:05:02,479
Yes.

116
00:05:03,849 --> 00:05:05,982
And they actually
took you seriously?

117
00:05:05,984 --> 00:05:09,119
Oh, the tenants association
takes every complaint seriously.

118
00:05:09,121 --> 00:05:11,088
Oh, great, because I'm about
to send them an e-mail

119
00:05:11,090 --> 00:05:14,024
complaining about you.

120
00:05:16,095 --> 00:05:18,161
Excuse me.

121
00:05:22,935 --> 00:05:25,235
Wow.

122
00:05:25,237 --> 00:05:29,239
Someone should have
spell-checked.

123
00:05:29,241 --> 00:05:30,607
What is going on here?

124
00:05:30,609 --> 00:05:32,509
You're the tenants
association?

125
00:05:32,511 --> 00:05:35,045
You should see
the look on your face.

126
00:05:35,981 --> 00:05:37,414
You might want to
tell your wife

127
00:05:37,416 --> 00:05:40,417
that there's no “Y”
in “pastrami.”

128
00:05:43,655 --> 00:05:46,123
Okay, that ought
to do it.

129
00:05:46,125 --> 00:05:48,158
I've replaced the propeller

130
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:50,660
and reattached the
gimbal controller unit.

131
00:05:50,662 --> 00:05:54,664
Dude, you're like
<i>Grey's Anatomy</i> for robots.

132
00:05:55,634 --> 00:05:57,801
Also, why isn't that a show?

133
00:05:57,803 --> 00:06:00,403
I just need to see
if I can re-sync

134
00:06:00,405 --> 00:06:02,339
the controls to
this old remote.

135
00:06:02,341 --> 00:06:03,607
We should name it.

136
00:06:03,609 --> 00:06:06,376
The drone, or your
stupid robot show?

137
00:06:06,378 --> 00:06:08,512
The drone.

138
00:06:08,514 --> 00:06:10,280
The show's already got
a name--

139
00:06:10,282 --> 00:06:12,415
<i>General Bot-spital.</i>

140
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:17,888
I got it working!

141
00:06:17,890 --> 00:06:19,256
Oh, oh!

142
00:06:19,258 --> 00:06:20,390
Let's play William Tell.

143
00:06:20,392 --> 00:06:21,858
I'll put this bowl
on my head.

144
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:25,095
See if you can knock it off
without hitting me.

145
00:06:26,098 --> 00:06:28,965
You read my mind.

146
00:06:28,967 --> 00:06:30,700
What are you doing?

147
00:06:30,702 --> 00:06:35,105
Either breaking a bowl
or breaking Raj's head.

148
00:06:35,107 --> 00:06:37,707
Be careful, they don't
make that bowl anymore.

149
00:06:43,916 --> 00:06:46,183
It's a nice one.

150
00:06:46,185 --> 00:06:49,186
Yeah. We found it in the yard
and fixed it up.

151
00:06:49,188 --> 00:06:50,687
Aren't you worried there's
some kid out there

152
00:06:50,689 --> 00:06:52,122
missing his drone?

153
00:06:52,124 --> 00:06:53,256
Oh, please, Bernadette,

154
00:06:53,258 --> 00:06:54,758
this is not
a children's toy, okay?

155
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:56,593
This thing's got
an HD camera on it.

156
00:06:56,595 --> 00:06:58,128
Okay, then aren't you worried
there's some rich

157
00:06:58,130 --> 00:07:00,564
Peeping Tom out there
missing his drone?

158
00:07:00,566 --> 00:07:04,267
We asked around,
and no one claimed it.

159
00:07:04,269 --> 00:07:06,703
Ha. I think we've
done all we can do.

160
00:07:07,839 --> 00:07:09,339
Did you check the video card?

161
00:07:09,341 --> 00:07:11,107
Maybe you can see where
it started off from.

162
00:07:11,109 --> 00:07:14,277
What a great idea, honey.

163
00:07:16,715 --> 00:07:18,014
So, let me get
this straight.

164
00:07:18,016 --> 00:07:20,550
You are the president
of the tenants association?

165
00:07:20,552 --> 00:07:24,721
President, only member,
and harshest critic.

166
00:07:24,723 --> 00:07:27,724
I once gave myself
an official reprimand

167
00:07:27,726 --> 00:07:30,927
for conducting a meeting
in the shower.

168
00:07:30,929 --> 00:07:33,697
The steam warped my gavel.

169
00:07:33,699 --> 00:07:36,433
Okay, so when I got a fine
for leaving my clothes

170
00:07:36,435 --> 00:07:38,602
in the dryer for too long,
that was from you?

171
00:07:38,604 --> 00:07:40,670
$14.99.

172
00:07:40,672 --> 00:07:43,139
The exact price of a new gavel.

173
00:07:43,141 --> 00:07:45,842
And the noise complaint
we got

174
00:07:45,844 --> 00:07:47,944
for singing you
“Happy Birthday”?

175
00:07:47,946 --> 00:07:51,081
As a friend, I was touched.

176
00:07:51,083 --> 00:07:52,549
As a representative
of the building,

177
00:07:52,551 --> 00:07:55,919
I thought that you should
pick a key and stick with it.

178
00:07:57,322 --> 00:07:57,905
Hi.

179
00:07:57,929 --> 00:08:00,310
Do you know he is the entire
tenants association?

180
00:08:00,592 --> 00:08:02,859
No, but I'm not
surprised.

181
00:08:02,861 --> 00:08:06,062
He's also the pope of a planet
he invented in hyperspace.

182
00:08:07,933 --> 00:08:09,299
Why didn't you tell me?

183
00:08:09,301 --> 00:08:11,034
'Cause I wanted to make sure
that you loved the man,

184
00:08:11,036 --> 00:08:12,569
not the office.

185
00:08:12,571 --> 00:08:15,538
You can't just declare
yourself president.

186
00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:17,974
I didn't.
I called a meeting,

187
00:08:17,976 --> 00:08:19,542
I was the only one to attend.

188
00:08:19,544 --> 00:08:22,512
I nominated myself, and after
a pretty moving speech,

189
00:08:22,514 --> 00:08:24,848
I voted myself in.

190
00:08:24,850 --> 00:08:27,317
Well, if you can
vote yourself in,

191
00:08:27,319 --> 00:08:28,718
then we can vote you out.
Yeah.

192
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,317
Fine. Make a motion
at the next meeting.

193
00:08:30,341 --> 00:08:31,289
When is that?

194
00:08:31,290 --> 00:08:32,989
It's the first Saturday
of every month.

195
00:08:32,991 --> 00:08:34,924
Unless there's
an emergency meeting.

196
00:08:34,926 --> 00:08:36,426
Then we call
an emergency meeting.

197
00:08:36,428 --> 00:08:37,494
You really don't have to.

198
00:08:37,496 --> 00:08:39,362
This is the first Saturday
of the month.

199
00:08:39,364 --> 00:08:41,931
Okay, fine.
Then we vote you out.

200
00:08:41,933 --> 00:08:42,999
Uh, uh, hold on.

201
00:08:43,001 --> 00:08:44,534
Hold on. First,

202
00:08:44,536 --> 00:08:47,671
we have to read the minutes
from last month's meeting.

203
00:08:47,673 --> 00:08:50,473
Amy, would you do the honors?

204
00:08:50,475 --> 00:08:52,342
Why not?

205
00:08:52,344 --> 00:08:53,710
“Saturday, March 3rd.

206
00:08:53,712 --> 00:08:56,179
“7:05, meeting called to order.

207
00:08:56,181 --> 00:08:59,549
“7:06, president gets
shampoo in eye.

208
00:09:01,253 --> 00:09:02,986
7:07, meeting adjourned.”

209
00:09:02,988 --> 00:09:05,255
Okay, can we
vote you out now?

210
00:09:05,257 --> 00:09:08,024
Ah, very well. New business.

211
00:09:09,895 --> 00:09:11,728
I move for a vote
of no confidence

212
00:09:11,730 --> 00:09:13,430
in the president.
Yeah.

213
00:09:13,432 --> 00:09:14,831
Two to one, you lose.

214
00:09:14,833 --> 00:09:17,500
Not so fast. I believe
we have one tenant here

215
00:09:17,502 --> 00:09:20,003
who has not made
her voice heard.

216
00:09:22,374 --> 00:09:24,607
Oh...

217
00:09:24,609 --> 00:09:27,277
We're waiting, fianc?e.

218
00:09:28,513 --> 00:09:31,915
Yeah, we're waiting,
best friend.

219
00:09:31,917 --> 00:09:32,916
Yeah, we're waiting,

220
00:09:32,918 --> 00:09:35,452
neighbor who needed a battery

221
00:09:35,454 --> 00:09:39,289
and totally got one from me,
no strings attached.

222
00:09:39,291 --> 00:09:42,325
I don't want to be
in the middle of this.

223
00:09:42,327 --> 00:09:44,260
No matter which way I vote,
I'm either

224
00:09:44,262 --> 00:09:46,529
a bad friend,
a bad fianc?e,

225
00:09:46,531 --> 00:09:49,699
or an ungrateful recipient
of a battery.

226
00:09:49,701 --> 00:09:51,434
Next time I have a meeting
in the shower,

227
00:09:51,436 --> 00:09:52,569
you're welcome to attend.

228
00:09:52,571 --> 00:09:55,138
Sheldon. Sheldon for president.
I pick Sheldon!

229
00:09:59,246 --> 00:10:02,076
Ugh, I can't believe my best
friend sided with Sheldon.

230
00:10:02,077 --> 00:10:05,546
Can't believe my best friend
<i>is</i> Sheldon.

231
00:10:05,548 --> 00:10:07,848
Ah, I should've taken
that gavel

232
00:10:07,850 --> 00:10:09,950
and shoved it right down
 his throat.
- Ugh.

233
00:10:09,952 --> 00:10:10,951
I would've gone the other way,

234
00:10:10,953 --> 00:10:13,120
but it would've gotten
to his throat.

235
00:10:13,856 --> 00:10:15,355
What?

236
00:10:15,357 --> 00:10:16,623
Don't be mad at me.

237
00:10:16,625 --> 00:10:18,091
I mean, I can't vote
against him.

238
00:10:18,093 --> 00:10:19,526
Even when he's being crazy?

239
00:10:19,528 --> 00:10:21,528
Well, what other times
are there?!

240
00:10:21,530 --> 00:10:24,064
So you just let him get
away with anything?

241
00:10:24,066 --> 00:10:25,866
Well, not anything.

242
00:10:25,868 --> 00:10:27,668
But honestly,
pastrami sandwich

243
00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:29,636
is not the hill
I want to die on.

244
00:10:29,638 --> 00:10:31,471
It's not about
the sandwich.

245
00:10:31,473 --> 00:10:32,739
It's about
the principle.

246
00:10:32,741 --> 00:10:33,674
Yeah, principle.

247
00:10:33,676 --> 00:10:36,410
And a little bit sandwich.
Yeah.

248
00:10:36,412 --> 00:10:38,845
Look, there are a bunch of other
tenants in this building.

249
00:10:38,847 --> 00:10:41,248
All you need is for one of them
to vote your way,

250
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:43,216
and then Sheldon's out
and I didn't betray him.

251
00:10:43,218 --> 00:10:45,085
Hey, you know, that's
actually a good plan.

252
00:10:45,087 --> 00:10:48,355
That you came up with
all by yourself.

253
00:10:49,658 --> 00:10:52,025
Now, if you'll excuse me,

254
00:10:52,027 --> 00:10:53,727
told Sheldon
I was going to the market,

255
00:10:53,729 --> 00:10:56,964
so... I'm taking
some of your stuff.

256
00:11:05,941 --> 00:11:07,941
I was never here.

257
00:11:10,713 --> 00:11:13,113
Sometimes you don't see it
'cause she's next to Sheldon,

258
00:11:13,115 --> 00:11:15,082
but she's pretty weird.

259
00:11:17,152 --> 00:11:20,020
Okay. All hooked up.
Here we go.

260
00:11:20,022 --> 00:11:22,255
I hope there's nothing
disturbing on there.

261
00:11:22,257 --> 00:11:24,424
Like you two in a hot tub?

262
00:11:26,395 --> 00:11:28,762
Hold on.
Now I'm getting a picture.

263
00:11:33,002 --> 00:11:34,835
That's not very
much to go on.

264
00:11:34,837 --> 00:11:38,138
Oh, that's plenty to go on.

265
00:11:39,775 --> 00:11:41,008
We can't give up.

266
00:11:41,010 --> 00:11:43,577
We got to find her.

267
00:11:43,579 --> 00:11:46,146
You just want to find
her 'cause she's cute.

268
00:11:46,148 --> 00:11:48,281
Not just because she's cute.

269
00:11:48,283 --> 00:11:49,850
She also owns
a pretty expensive drone,

270
00:11:49,852 --> 00:11:51,952
which means she has money
and doesn't mind wasting it.

271
00:11:51,954 --> 00:11:54,921
And I... I like that in a woman.

272
00:11:56,125 --> 00:11:58,558
Do you see anything that could
help us locate her?

273
00:11:58,560 --> 00:11:59,893
Hmm, let me have a look.

274
00:11:59,895 --> 00:12:01,061
She's got eagle eyes,

275
00:12:01,063 --> 00:12:03,463
always spotting continuity
errors in movies.

276
00:12:03,465 --> 00:12:06,700
It's not annoying at all.

277
00:12:06,702 --> 00:12:08,568
Oh. There.

278
00:12:08,570 --> 00:12:09,836
Right there.

279
00:12:09,838 --> 00:12:11,405
Check out the pin
on her jacket.

280
00:12:11,407 --> 00:12:13,106
Isn't that from
the comic book store?

281
00:12:13,108 --> 00:12:14,241
Hmm, is it?

282
00:12:14,243 --> 00:12:16,209
Hey, Howard, zoom in.
Oh.

283
00:12:16,211 --> 00:12:19,713
Fine. Zooming in.

284
00:12:21,517 --> 00:12:23,216
Yeah, I know
you're being a jerk,

285
00:12:23,218 --> 00:12:25,619
but it's actually helpful.

286
00:12:27,790 --> 00:12:28,989
Hi.

287
00:12:28,991 --> 00:12:30,724
Hi. We're your neighbors
from downstairs.

288
00:12:30,726 --> 00:12:31,958
We've met.

289
00:12:32,961 --> 00:12:34,094
Remember?

290
00:12:34,096 --> 00:12:35,996
I invited you to my housewarming
when I moved in.

291
00:12:35,998 --> 00:12:37,597
Oh, yeah. Sorry.

292
00:12:37,599 --> 00:12:39,266
You know, it's been
a crazy couple months.

293
00:12:39,268 --> 00:12:41,034
That was two years ago.

294
00:12:42,871 --> 00:12:46,006
Welcome to the building.
Mm-hmm.

295
00:12:46,008 --> 00:12:49,209
So, I-I'm running for president
of the tenants association.

296
00:12:49,211 --> 00:12:50,577
I could really use your vote.

297
00:12:50,579 --> 00:12:52,279
You said you were gonna stop by.

298
00:12:52,281 --> 00:12:54,214
I bought a lot of food.

299
00:12:54,216 --> 00:12:56,950
Anyway, meeting's tomorrow.

300
00:12:56,952 --> 00:12:58,318
We really hope
you can make it.

301
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,153
I'll be there.
Oh, really?

302
00:13:00,155 --> 00:13:02,923
Yeah. You should buy
a lot of food.

303
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:07,761
So, I'm running for president
of the tenants association

304
00:13:07,763 --> 00:13:09,296
and I could really use
your vote.

305
00:13:09,298 --> 00:13:10,430
Uh, who's president now?

306
00:13:10,432 --> 00:13:11,765
Uh, Sheldon Cooper.

307
00:13:11,767 --> 00:13:13,200
You know, about yay tall

308
00:13:13,202 --> 00:13:15,001
and about yay annoying.

309
00:13:16,171 --> 00:13:18,371
So you want me to vote
against Sheldon Cooper?

310
00:13:18,373 --> 00:13:19,873
Yeah. You just need
to show up at a meeting...

311
00:13:19,875 --> 00:13:21,241
Oh, no, no. No can do.

312
00:13:21,243 --> 00:13:23,543
He's got a restraining order
against me.

313
00:13:23,545 --> 00:13:25,412
Really? Why?

314
00:13:25,414 --> 00:13:26,847
Uh, I locked him
on the roof once.

315
00:13:26,849 --> 00:13:29,082
Three times.

316
00:13:30,119 --> 00:13:32,018
So, Mrs. Petrescu,

317
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:33,653
we were hoping you would vote
for Leonard

318
00:13:33,655 --> 00:13:35,021
instead of voting for Sheldon.

319
00:13:35,023 --> 00:13:37,023
Vote Sheldon.

320
00:13:37,025 --> 00:13:39,626
No, no. Vote Leonard.

321
00:13:39,628 --> 00:13:42,162
No vote Leonard.

322
00:13:42,164 --> 00:13:46,399
No. Vote Leonard.

323
00:13:46,401 --> 00:13:48,769
Thank you.

324
00:13:52,007 --> 00:13:54,307
She's wearing a pin
from your store.

325
00:13:54,309 --> 00:13:55,642
Do you know who she is?

326
00:13:55,644 --> 00:13:56,977
Oh, sure, yeah.
That's Cynthia.

327
00:13:56,979 --> 00:13:59,079
Wha... s-so,
she's a customer?

328
00:13:59,081 --> 00:14:01,581
Yeah, yeah, but I-I haven't
seen her in a while.

329
00:14:01,583 --> 00:14:03,250
And before you say anything,

330
00:14:03,252 --> 00:14:05,585
there is a lot of reasons
women stop coming here.

331
00:14:05,587 --> 00:14:07,454
It's not just me.

332
00:14:07,456 --> 00:14:09,656
But this time...

333
00:14:09,658 --> 00:14:10,891
It was me. Yeah.

334
00:14:12,027 --> 00:14:15,729
I was trying out
a flirty new smile.

335
00:14:19,668 --> 00:14:22,736
Now, I don't use the word

336
00:14:22,738 --> 00:14:26,072
“ghoulish” a lot, but...

337
00:14:26,074 --> 00:14:29,075
I-I just can't think
of another word.

338
00:14:30,112 --> 00:14:32,646
Wait, do you know
how to find her?

339
00:14:32,648 --> 00:14:35,215
Yeah. I think I have her
address on my mailing list.

340
00:14:35,217 --> 00:14:37,551
Oh. Hey. Please, let me bring
the drone back to her.

341
00:14:37,553 --> 00:14:39,352
You think you've got a shot?

342
00:14:39,354 --> 00:14:41,354
What if she's married?
She's not.

343
00:14:41,356 --> 00:14:43,323
It's meant to be.

344
00:14:43,325 --> 00:14:44,624
A little tip.

345
00:14:44,626 --> 00:14:47,828
Uh, stick with the smiles
you know.

346
00:14:52,668 --> 00:14:54,401
Hi. What are you doing?

347
00:14:54,403 --> 00:14:57,270
Leonard and Penny are trying
to turn the tenants against me,

348
00:14:57,272 --> 00:14:59,739
so they are about to see
just what kind of power

349
00:14:59,741 --> 00:15:02,209
the president of
the tenants association wields.

350
00:15:03,512 --> 00:15:07,447
“You must be at least this tall
to use washing machine”?

351
00:15:07,449 --> 00:15:11,151
I'm gonna hang it up
higher than Leonard.

352
00:15:11,153 --> 00:15:14,054
And then his clothes
will smell.

353
00:15:14,056 --> 00:15:16,890
And nobody's voting for a man
with smelly clothes.

354
00:15:16,892 --> 00:15:18,892
No, not when there's
a perfectly unscented

355
00:15:18,894 --> 00:15:20,227
incumbent on the ballot.

356
00:15:20,229 --> 00:15:23,230
Sheldon, I have
an advanced degree

357
00:15:23,232 --> 00:15:24,698
in the study of
the human brain,

358
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:27,000
so if my fianc?
is a raving lunatic,

359
00:15:27,002 --> 00:15:29,035
it's kind of a ding
on my reputation.

360
00:15:29,037 --> 00:15:32,138
If leaders
just stepped aside

361
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:34,274
every time they didn't have
the consent of the governed,

362
00:15:34,276 --> 00:15:35,308
what would we have?

363
00:15:35,310 --> 00:15:38,078
Democracy.

364
00:15:38,947 --> 00:15:40,513
Not on my watch.

365
00:15:45,654 --> 00:15:47,020
Okay. Don't be weird.

366
00:15:47,022 --> 00:15:49,322
Don't be weird.
Don't be weird.

367
00:15:49,324 --> 00:15:51,591
Hello.

368
00:15:51,593 --> 00:15:54,027
Hey. You found my drone.

369
00:15:54,029 --> 00:15:55,128
Yeah, yeah. Yes.

370
00:15:55,130 --> 00:15:56,830
It took a while
to track you down,

371
00:15:56,832 --> 00:15:59,466
but to see the look on
your face, it was worth it.

372
00:15:59,468 --> 00:16:01,601
Aw, that's sweet.

373
00:16:01,603 --> 00:16:03,370
Rajesh.

374
00:16:03,372 --> 00:16:05,071
Cynthia.
Ah, pleasure to meet you.

375
00:16:05,073 --> 00:16:07,107
Likewise.

376
00:16:07,109 --> 00:16:09,809
I-I feel like I should give you
a reward or something.

377
00:16:09,811 --> 00:16:11,378
Oh, oh, no, you don't
have to do that.

378
00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:12,312
No, I insist.

379
00:16:12,314 --> 00:16:13,880
How about your
phone number?

380
00:16:13,882 --> 00:16:16,583
Give me your phone.

381
00:16:20,622 --> 00:16:24,157
Thanks. So, I'll-I'll
call you, Cynthia.

382
00:16:24,159 --> 00:16:26,092
Great, Rajesh.

383
00:16:26,094 --> 00:16:27,694
And thanks again.

384
00:16:27,696 --> 00:16:29,129
Uh, sure.

385
00:16:33,435 --> 00:16:35,902
Just checking.

386
00:16:39,942 --> 00:16:41,641
Hey, Sheldon.

387
00:16:41,643 --> 00:16:45,845
We found something
pretty interesting.

388
00:16:45,847 --> 00:16:49,449
Huh. Well, that is surprising.

389
00:16:49,451 --> 00:16:53,253
I, for one, have no idea
what they're talking about.

390
00:16:53,255 --> 00:16:55,889
Turns out, when Amy took over
Penny's apartment,

391
00:16:55,891 --> 00:16:58,591
she was put on the lease,
not you.

392
00:16:58,593 --> 00:17:00,260
Yeah, and when I
moved across the hall,

393
00:17:00,262 --> 00:17:02,595
you got taken off the
lease and I got added.

394
00:17:02,597 --> 00:17:04,664
Well, what are you saying?

395
00:17:04,666 --> 00:17:06,800
That Sheldon's not
technically a tenant at all

396
00:17:06,802 --> 00:17:09,869
and therefore,
has no standing to be president

397
00:17:09,871 --> 00:17:12,973
of the tenants association
no matter who votes for him?

398
00:17:13,909 --> 00:17:15,742
I don't know
how you found that out,

399
00:17:15,744 --> 00:17:18,111
but I am guessing
all on your own.

400
00:17:18,113 --> 00:17:20,647
So, looks like
we need to figure out

401
00:17:20,649 --> 00:17:22,148
who the new president
should be.

402
00:17:22,150 --> 00:17:23,750
I nominate myself.
I second it.

403
00:17:23,752 --> 00:17:25,785
Huh.

404
00:17:25,787 --> 00:17:28,989
Well, as a woman in love,
I want to stand by my man.

405
00:17:28,991 --> 00:17:32,292
Too bad that's been rendered
bureaucratically impossible.

406
00:17:34,162 --> 00:17:36,896
Well, this is hard for me

407
00:17:36,898 --> 00:17:39,566
because I do love
a legal technicality

408
00:17:39,568 --> 00:17:41,001
and this is a good one.

409
00:17:41,003 --> 00:17:44,938
Although, not quite as good as
the provision in California law,

410
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:47,674
which states a person
who occupies a dwelling

411
00:17:47,676 --> 00:17:51,978
for 30 consecutive days becomes
a tenant at will and as such...

412
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:54,547
I vote for Leonard!
You...

413
00:17:54,549 --> 00:17:55,882
What?

414
00:17:55,884 --> 00:17:57,917
I'm sorry, Sheldon.

415
00:17:57,919 --> 00:18:00,854
With minimal power comes
minimal responsibility,

416
00:18:00,856 --> 00:18:03,256
and you couldn't handle it.

417
00:18:03,258 --> 00:18:07,227
Don't you misquote <i>Spider-Man</i>
to me.

418
00:18:07,229 --> 00:18:08,194
It's not your fault.

419
00:18:08,196 --> 00:18:10,463
I mean, what man
wouldn't be seduced

420
00:18:10,465 --> 00:18:13,933
by the power to decide how late
the laundry room stays open?

421
00:18:13,935 --> 00:18:16,069
Wait, you're the reason
I had to come back

422
00:18:16,071 --> 00:18:17,904
and get my jeans
the next morning?

423
00:18:19,274 --> 00:18:21,808
I can't believe you expect
me to give that up.

424
00:18:23,345 --> 00:18:25,545
Sheldon,
it's the American way,

425
00:18:25,547 --> 00:18:27,313
the peaceful transfer
of power.

426
00:18:27,315 --> 00:18:28,748
I don't know.

427
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:30,617
Think about <i>Ant-Man.</i>

428
00:18:30,619 --> 00:18:34,187
I'm always thinking
about <i>Ant-Man.</i>

429
00:18:34,189 --> 00:18:35,588
Michael Douglas had the suit

430
00:18:35,590 --> 00:18:38,158
and then he passed it on
to Paul Rudd.

431
00:18:40,062 --> 00:18:41,895
Maybe you're right.

432
00:18:41,897 --> 00:18:43,363
Really?
The <i>Ant-Man</i> thing?

433
00:18:43,365 --> 00:18:45,432
That's what won you over?

434
00:18:45,434 --> 00:18:47,200
Yes. He got the details right.

435
00:18:47,202 --> 00:18:48,768
That's how you use
a superhero.

436
00:18:48,770 --> 00:18:50,437
Mm.

437
00:18:50,439 --> 00:18:53,440
I suppose it is time I
passed this on to Leonard.

438
00:18:53,442 --> 00:18:55,141
Thank you.
Yeah, thanks.

439
00:18:55,143 --> 00:18:57,010
I-I know that's hard for you.

440
00:18:57,012 --> 00:18:58,511
Well, it was.

441
00:18:58,513 --> 00:18:59,946
But you know what?

442
00:18:59,948 --> 00:19:01,781
Instead of being in charge,

443
00:19:01,783 --> 00:19:04,551
I can now be
the vocal opposition,

444
00:19:04,553 --> 00:19:08,021
criticizing and badgering
the president at every turn.

445
00:19:08,023 --> 00:19:11,424
I think you'll be
really good at that.

446
00:19:11,426 --> 00:19:13,426
Me, too.

447
00:19:13,428 --> 00:19:17,297
I think I've made
a huge mistake.

448
00:19:17,299 --> 00:19:19,365
Me, too.

449
00:19:24,124 --> 00:19:25,791
Can't believe you
got her number.

450
00:19:25,793 --> 00:19:27,592
I know, right?

451
00:19:27,594 --> 00:19:30,028
How amazing would it be
if this worked out

452
00:19:30,030 --> 00:19:31,763
and the story
of how I met my wife

453
00:19:31,765 --> 00:19:34,633
started with you and me
in the hot tub together.

454
00:19:36,403 --> 00:19:41,239
Well, do us both a favor
and start the story later.

455
00:19:41,241 --> 00:19:42,741
Whatever.

456
00:19:42,743 --> 00:19:44,643
I have a good feeling
about this girl.

457
00:19:44,645 --> 00:19:46,211
Like, we really hit it off.

458
00:19:46,213 --> 00:19:48,146
Stop flying it around.

459
00:19:48,148 --> 00:19:49,648
You're gonna break it.

460
00:19:49,650 --> 00:19:51,416
Why do you care?

461
00:19:51,418 --> 00:19:54,886
Because we have to give it back
to the beautiful mystery girl.

462
00:19:54,888 --> 00:19:56,154
Aw.

463
00:19:56,156 --> 00:19:57,856
I mean, did you see
how hot she was?

464
00:19:57,858 --> 00:20:00,792
I want to get all up on that
and start making babies!

465
00:20:00,794 --> 00:20:03,695
I know exactly what underwear

466
00:20:03,697 --> 00:20:06,398
I'm gonna wear
on our first date.

467
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:07,866
None!
