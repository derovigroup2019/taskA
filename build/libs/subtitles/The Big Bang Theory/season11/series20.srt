1
00:00:01,871 --> 00:00:04,322
If Bruce Banner's driving
a rental car

2
00:00:04,323 --> 00:00:07,157
and turns into the Hulk,
do you think he's covered,

3
00:00:07,159 --> 00:00:11,829
or does he need to add the Hulk
as an additional driver?

4
00:00:11,831 --> 00:00:14,431
You really need
a girlfriend.

5
00:00:15,768 --> 00:00:19,036
Mailman's here!

6
00:00:19,038 --> 00:00:23,207
Aw. Remember when he used to
get that excited to see us?

7
00:00:23,209 --> 00:00:25,342
Do you have any mail
for Dr. Sheldon Cooper?

8
00:00:25,344 --> 00:00:27,645
I do, but I can't hand it
right to you...

9
00:00:27,647 --> 00:00:29,480
I have to put it in the box.

10
00:00:29,482 --> 00:00:31,949
And that is what separates
the U.S. Postal Service

11
00:00:31,951 --> 00:00:34,285
from those hippies at FedEx.

12
00:00:35,955 --> 00:00:37,321
Oh, goody!

13
00:00:38,958 --> 00:00:40,658
What is so exciting?

14
00:00:40,660 --> 00:00:42,426
It's a letter from Dr. Wolcott.

15
00:00:42,428 --> 00:00:45,396
We've been corresponding
about my string theory research.

16
00:00:45,398 --> 00:00:49,466
Wait. Robert Wolcott?
Like Wolcott's Theorem Wolcott?

17
00:00:49,468 --> 00:00:50,934
The very same.

18
00:00:50,936 --> 00:00:52,169
Didn't he go crazy

19
00:00:52,171 --> 00:00:54,238
and cut off all
contact with people?

20
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:56,774
Yeah, he was driven mad
by a friend

21
00:00:56,776 --> 00:01:01,111
who kept wanting to talk
about the Hulk's car insurance!

22
00:01:01,113 --> 00:01:03,981
Oh. He's invited me to his cabin
for the weekend,

23
00:01:03,983 --> 00:01:06,317
to discuss
a breakthrough he's had.

24
00:01:06,319 --> 00:01:08,986
- His cabin?
- Yes. He lives off the grid,

25
00:01:08,988 --> 00:01:10,220
up in the mountains.

26
00:01:10,222 --> 00:01:12,222
So you're gonna go
to the middle of nowhere

27
00:01:12,224 --> 00:01:15,526
and spend the weekend with
a crazy man you've never met?

28
00:01:15,528 --> 00:01:17,394
Yes. Why?

29
00:01:18,397 --> 00:01:19,564
No reason. Have fun.

Oh, nice one.

44
00:02:01,249 --> 00:02:04,050
Hey, Penny, that's what you
sound like when you read.

45
00:02:05,153 --> 00:02:07,286
- Hey!
- What?

46
00:02:07,288 --> 00:02:09,489
<i>He</i> said it.

47
00:02:09,491 --> 00:02:10,823
Sheldon, what are you doing?

48
00:02:10,825 --> 00:02:12,825
I am decoding
Dr. Wolcott's letter

49
00:02:12,827 --> 00:02:14,527
using this book as the key.

50
00:02:14,529 --> 00:02:17,063
Aren't conversations more fun
when they're in code?

51
00:02:17,065 --> 00:02:21,367
Yes. But I'm using a code
where "yes" means "no."

52
00:02:21,369 --> 00:02:22,735
Oh. I got it!

53
00:02:22,737 --> 00:02:24,837
He's given me directions
to his cabin.

54
00:02:24,839 --> 00:02:26,472
He seems a little paranoid.

55
00:02:26,474 --> 00:02:28,675
He is not paranoid.

56
00:02:29,778 --> 00:02:32,645
- What are you doing?
- Following his instructions.

57
00:02:39,621 --> 00:02:42,388
Leonard, you are not letting
Sheldon go alone this weekend.

58
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:45,158
I am a grown man... I don't need
somebody to chaperone me.

59
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:47,794
I just need him
to drop me off, pick me up,

60
00:02:47,796 --> 00:02:49,262
and pack me a sack lunch.

61
00:02:49,264 --> 00:02:50,797
Don't look at me.

62
00:02:50,799 --> 00:02:54,767
When the music stopped,
you were holding Sheldon.

63
00:02:54,769 --> 00:02:57,637
Amy can't take him... it's her
bachelorette party this weekend.

64
00:02:57,639 --> 00:02:58,638
Yes, it is...

65
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:00,273
because I'm getting married!

66
00:03:00,275 --> 00:03:02,675
Are you gonna be doing that
all weekend?

67
00:03:02,677 --> 00:03:03,776
Yes. Do you know why?

68
00:03:03,778 --> 00:03:05,044
Because you're getting married!

69
00:03:06,114 --> 00:03:07,246
All right, Leonard,

70
00:03:07,248 --> 00:03:08,748
looks like you're driving me.

71
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:11,184
But maybe you could drop me
at the bottom of the mountain.

72
00:03:11,186 --> 00:03:12,685
I want him to think I'm cool.

73
00:03:12,687 --> 00:03:15,822
That's great,
everyone's got weekend plans.

74
00:03:15,824 --> 00:03:17,290
Amy has her
bachelorette party,

75
00:03:17,292 --> 00:03:20,193
and Sheldon's gonna go
to the woods and get hunted for sport.

76
00:03:20,195 --> 00:03:22,295
Yeah, as someone
who has to track him every time

77
00:03:22,297 --> 00:03:25,698
he gets lost in IKEA, I feel
like I'd be really good at that.

78
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:27,133
Leonard, you
cannot drop him off.

79
00:03:27,135 --> 00:03:29,469
You have to stay with him
and keep him safe.

80
00:03:29,471 --> 00:03:31,098
Howard, you have to go
and keep Leonard safe.

81
00:03:31,122 --> 00:03:32,206
Fine.

82
00:03:32,207 --> 00:03:35,374
I get it-- and you want me
to go and keep Howard safe.

83
00:03:35,376 --> 00:03:37,643
- Actually, I...
- Uh, just say yes, or he's gonna want

84
00:03:37,645 --> 00:03:39,378
to come to the
bachelorette party.

85
00:03:41,983 --> 00:03:44,383
Are you sure you're
gonna be okay this weekend?

86
00:03:44,385 --> 00:03:45,785
Of course.

87
00:03:45,787 --> 00:03:47,754
No, I'm much more concerned
about you.

88
00:03:47,756 --> 00:03:51,257
I know how you gals behave
when the men are away.

89
00:03:51,259 --> 00:03:53,192
You do?

90
00:03:53,194 --> 00:03:55,695
I've read <i>The Bacchae</i>
by Euripides.

91
00:03:55,697 --> 00:03:58,831
Drinking wine,
riding panthers...

92
00:03:59,934 --> 00:04:04,070
Proof that girls have gone wild
for over 2,500 years.

93
00:04:04,072 --> 00:04:06,706
Well, I wish I could say
none of that is gonna happen,

94
00:04:06,708 --> 00:04:08,908
but Penny is planning it,
and she is the reason

95
00:04:08,910 --> 00:04:11,778
I own those underwear
with writing across the butt.

96
00:04:12,781 --> 00:04:15,448
Well, just be careful,

97
00:04:15,450 --> 00:04:17,250
and use protection.

98
00:04:17,252 --> 00:04:20,520
What do you think
is gonna happen?

99
00:04:20,522 --> 00:04:22,789
I don't know.
But it's going to be sunny,

100
00:04:22,791 --> 00:04:25,224
and you burn easily.

101
00:04:25,226 --> 00:04:26,592
It'll be fine.

102
00:04:26,594 --> 00:04:28,795
I'm sure there'll be
some drinking and some dancing,

103
00:04:28,797 --> 00:04:31,097
and then a mailman'll
probably show up

104
00:04:31,099 --> 00:04:32,231
and take his clothes off...

105
00:04:32,233 --> 00:04:35,101
Nicholas is going to
take his clothes off?

106
00:04:35,103 --> 00:04:37,904
No, not <i>our</i> mailman.

107
00:04:37,906 --> 00:04:39,839
A dancer pretending
to be a mailman.

108
00:04:39,841 --> 00:04:42,008
Impersonating a
federal employee?

109
00:04:42,010 --> 00:04:44,544
Oh, where's the
after-party, prison?

110
00:04:46,414 --> 00:04:48,681
It's sweet that
you're worried about me.

111
00:04:48,683 --> 00:04:50,950
Well, of course
I'm worried about you--

112
00:04:50,952 --> 00:04:52,318
I want you to be safe.

113
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:53,753
And I want you to be safe.

114
00:04:53,755 --> 00:04:55,855
I will be. I'll have
my friends with me.

115
00:04:55,857 --> 00:04:59,258
If anything should go wrong,
I can use them as human shields.

116
00:05:02,564 --> 00:05:04,730
For most of human history,

117
00:05:04,732 --> 00:05:08,701
time was believed to be
an objective part of reality.

118
00:05:08,703 --> 00:05:12,939
But with the contributions
of Immanuel Kant,

119
00:05:12,941 --> 00:05:14,473
science and philosophy...

120
00:05:14,475 --> 00:05:17,510
When I said you should make
a playlist for the road trip,

121
00:05:17,512 --> 00:05:19,979
I meant music.

122
00:05:21,516 --> 00:05:23,015
This is better than music--

123
00:05:23,017 --> 00:05:25,451
this is a lecture
on nonlinear time.

124
00:05:25,453 --> 00:05:27,653
Sounds like it's
just on regular time.

125
00:05:27,655 --> 00:05:29,422
Yes. But I put it
on shuffle.

126
00:05:32,493 --> 00:05:33,759
This is nice.

127
00:05:33,761 --> 00:05:36,128
The four of us haven't
taken a trip like this

128
00:05:36,130 --> 00:05:37,730
since Leonard's
bachelor party.

129
00:05:37,732 --> 00:05:39,866
And now here we are
for Sheldon's.

130
00:05:39,868 --> 00:05:41,534
Yeah, uh,
Leonard...

131
00:05:41,536 --> 00:05:44,003
As Sheldon's best man,
I need to inform you

132
00:05:44,005 --> 00:05:46,372
that this is not
a bachelor party.

133
00:05:46,374 --> 00:05:48,140
And tell them why.
Because you're

134
00:05:48,142 --> 00:05:49,675
a tiresome scold.

135
00:05:50,945 --> 00:05:53,246
No. It's because
a bachelor party

136
00:05:53,248 --> 00:05:55,248
is typically
a hedonistic blowout

137
00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:57,516
where no pleasures
of the flesh are denied.

138
00:05:57,518 --> 00:05:58,951
I'm not interested in that.

139
00:05:58,953 --> 00:06:02,755
How is that not
exactly what I said?

140
00:06:05,593 --> 00:06:07,159
Okay, now, I promised Sheldon

141
00:06:07,161 --> 00:06:09,228
things weren't gonna get
too crazy tonight.

142
00:06:09,230 --> 00:06:10,596
Should I be worried?

143
00:06:10,598 --> 00:06:13,332
Oh, just about who
you're marrying.

144
00:06:16,738 --> 00:06:18,671
Just come on.

145
00:06:18,673 --> 00:06:21,774
Welcome to
your...

146
00:06:21,776 --> 00:06:24,443
bachelorette
party!

147
00:06:28,149 --> 00:06:30,349
Oh...

148
00:06:32,086 --> 00:06:33,419
It's a quilting bee!

149
00:06:33,421 --> 00:06:36,088
My bachelorette party's
a quilting bee!

150
00:06:36,090 --> 00:06:37,356
Isn't it perfect?

151
00:06:37,358 --> 00:06:40,026
Yeah, instead of oiled-up
strippers and sex toys,

152
00:06:40,028 --> 00:06:43,329
we thought: what
does Amy like?

153
00:06:45,633 --> 00:06:47,900
Amy likes the quilting bee!

154
00:06:50,838 --> 00:06:53,439
Well, this place
is creepy.

155
00:06:53,441 --> 00:06:54,674
Why?

156
00:06:54,676 --> 00:06:57,143
Well, did you see
his vegetable garden?

157
00:06:57,145 --> 00:06:59,211
Heirloom tomatoes in April.

158
00:06:59,213 --> 00:07:01,414
Creepy.

159
00:07:01,416 --> 00:07:02,748
Okay, listen.

160
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:05,518
Dr. Wolcott is
a brilliant topologist.

161
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:08,287
We need to set some ground rules
so that you don't embarrass me.

162
00:07:08,289 --> 00:07:10,523
No magic.
No whining.

163
00:07:10,525 --> 00:07:12,091
You-- just no.

164
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:14,160
Hey...

165
00:07:14,162 --> 00:07:17,663
Uh, how come
he gets to whine?

166
00:07:18,499 --> 00:07:19,966
Dr. Wolcott?

167
00:07:19,968 --> 00:07:22,802
Dr. Wolcott? Dr. Wolcott?

168
00:07:29,877 --> 00:07:31,444
That's a lot of locks.

169
00:07:31,446 --> 00:07:35,581
Mm. That was a lot of knocks--
they were made for each other.

170
00:07:38,186 --> 00:07:40,353
- Dr. Wolcott.
-Dr. Cooper.

171
00:07:40,355 --> 00:07:42,855
Uh, who are these people?

172
00:07:42,857 --> 00:07:45,458
Oh, these are my friends.
I wrote about them in my letter.

173
00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:47,960
Oh, letter?
I didn't get a letter.

174
00:07:47,962 --> 00:07:50,229
Well, that's because I just
sent it this morning, you know?

175
00:07:50,231 --> 00:07:53,065
So score one for linear time.

176
00:07:53,067 --> 00:07:56,802
Well, um, I don't normally
allow strangers into my house.

177
00:07:56,804 --> 00:08:00,973
But when you do, you-you
let them out, right?

178
00:08:00,975 --> 00:08:03,642
Dr. Cooper, if you
can promise me

179
00:08:03,644 --> 00:08:05,144
these men share
your intellect

180
00:08:05,146 --> 00:08:09,548
and academic rigor, yeah,
I suppose they can join us.

181
00:08:10,451 --> 00:08:13,152
You guys might need
to wait in the car.

182
00:08:17,096 --> 00:08:18,662
Well, let me
show you around.

183
00:08:18,664 --> 00:08:21,565
This is the chair where
I do most of my thinking,

184
00:08:21,567 --> 00:08:23,133
my thinking about work.

185
00:08:23,135 --> 00:08:26,303
Now, my thinking about people
who have <i>wronged</i> me,

186
00:08:26,305 --> 00:08:27,938
I do over there.

187
00:08:29,775 --> 00:08:32,109
I've always said that
<i>I</i> should get a grudge chair.

188
00:08:32,111 --> 00:08:33,252
Leonard, have I
not always said that?

189
00:08:33,276 --> 00:08:34,545
Mm, you have--

190
00:08:34,546 --> 00:08:36,544
but you were worried you'd
spend too much time in it.

191
00:08:36,568 --> 00:08:37,782
Yeah.

192
00:08:37,783 --> 00:08:40,917
That was a real concern.

193
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:43,987
Oh, my God,
this tomato is amazing!

194
00:08:43,989 --> 00:08:46,723
I can eat it like an apple.

195
00:08:46,725 --> 00:08:51,261
My secret is I fertilize it
with my own manure.

196
00:08:56,468 --> 00:08:58,935
The look on your face.

197
00:09:00,539 --> 00:09:04,341
It's a sort of grin.
You want to know what kind?

198
00:09:07,779 --> 00:09:09,613
So, Dr. Wolcott,

199
00:09:09,615 --> 00:09:12,349
in your letter, you said you had
a new mathematical approach

200
00:09:12,351 --> 00:09:15,452
that would help me conceptualize
the dimensions in string theory?

201
00:09:15,454 --> 00:09:18,722
Uh, yes, yes, yes, yes.
But before we get started,

202
00:09:18,724 --> 00:09:22,259
I am going to need to collect
everybody's phone. Yeah.

203
00:09:22,261 --> 00:09:24,294
- Oh.
- Why?

204
00:09:24,296 --> 00:09:26,630
Because they're little
listening devices, aren't they?

205
00:09:26,632 --> 00:09:30,567
Yes, for people to spy on you
and steal your work.

206
00:09:30,569 --> 00:09:32,235
Yeah, what happened
to the good old days

207
00:09:32,237 --> 00:09:34,004
where if someone wanted
to steal your work,

208
00:09:34,006 --> 00:09:37,607
they had to hire a
prostitute to seduce you?

209
00:09:37,609 --> 00:09:40,076
Who told you about that?

210
00:09:40,913 --> 00:09:42,946
Just making a joke.

211
00:09:42,948 --> 00:09:45,649
Yeah, it's not funny
when it happens.

212
00:09:45,651 --> 00:09:47,450
All right, now,

213
00:09:47,452 --> 00:09:51,788
you're probably going to want to
start with this notebook here.

214
00:09:51,790 --> 00:09:54,558
- Oh. Oh, my.
- Here we are.

215
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:56,059
Oh...

216
00:09:56,061 --> 00:09:57,794
Um...

217
00:09:57,796 --> 00:10:01,298
no offense, Dr. Wolcott, but I'm
not sure this makes any sense.

218
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:03,400
That's because I've
written it all backwards.

219
00:10:03,402 --> 00:10:05,468
You... Wow.

220
00:10:06,305 --> 00:10:08,972
That's "wow" backwards.

221
00:10:09,808 --> 00:10:11,274
Hmm. You know...

222
00:10:11,276 --> 00:10:13,191
I still don't get it.

223
00:10:13,215 --> 00:10:14,312
Well, plus the numbers
are letters

224
00:10:14,313 --> 00:10:15,657
and the letters are numbers.

225
00:10:15,681 --> 00:10:17,114
Oh.

226
00:10:17,115 --> 00:10:19,616
I love him.

227
00:10:30,996 --> 00:10:33,730
Are you having fun?

228
00:10:33,732 --> 00:10:35,498
Yeah.

229
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:39,369
I just, uh, finished sewing this
top to bottom.

230
00:10:39,371 --> 00:10:43,006
Now I'm gonna sew it
side to side.

231
00:10:43,008 --> 00:10:44,474
Pace yourself.

232
00:10:45,544 --> 00:10:46,576
Some more tea?

233
00:10:46,578 --> 00:10:48,645
Oh, lovely.

234
00:10:53,986 --> 00:10:54,951
Oh.

235
00:10:56,688 --> 00:10:58,922
Seriously? What the hell?

236
00:10:58,924 --> 00:11:00,457
- Huh?
- What?

237
00:11:00,459 --> 00:11:02,359
This is my bachelorette party,

238
00:11:02,361 --> 00:11:04,494
tea and quilts?
Well, you said

239
00:11:04,496 --> 00:11:06,630
you didn't want anything crazy.
- Yes,

240
00:11:06,632 --> 00:11:08,698
but I said it like, "I
don't want anything crazy."

241
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:11,701
Which clearly means
I wanted something crazy.

242
00:11:12,604 --> 00:11:14,904
I mean, is this how boring
you think I am?

243
00:11:14,906 --> 00:11:18,642
Penny, she asked
you a question.

244
00:11:19,411 --> 00:11:21,044
Of course not.

245
00:11:21,046 --> 00:11:23,213
So you thought that
I would like quilting?

246
00:11:23,215 --> 00:11:25,048
- Well, don't you?
- Of course I like quilting!

247
00:11:25,050 --> 00:11:27,651
It's the slowest way
to make a blanket!

248
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:30,387
But this is
my bachelorette party!

249
00:11:30,389 --> 00:11:34,090
It's supposed to be fun and wild
and full of bad decisions.

250
00:11:34,092 --> 00:11:36,459
- Hey, we can make bad decisions.
- Yeah.

251
00:11:36,461 --> 00:11:38,795
She had two kids back-to-back
and I thought you'd like this,

252
00:11:38,797 --> 00:11:40,897
so we're off
to a good start.

253
00:11:42,267 --> 00:11:44,200
Come on, let's go somewhere
we can do body shots

254
00:11:44,202 --> 00:11:45,835
off shirtless bartenders.
Yes.

255
00:11:45,837 --> 00:11:48,138
I don't know.
That might be too much.

256
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:50,073
All right, you know what,
why don't we stay home, have a little wine...

257
00:11:50,075 --> 00:11:52,409
What are you not
getting about this?!

258
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:58,581
Dr. Wolcott, your work
on time is revolutionary.

259
00:11:58,583 --> 00:12:00,250
I would say
thank you,

260
00:12:00,252 --> 00:12:01,484
but, in my theory of time,

261
00:12:01,486 --> 00:12:03,119
you've already called my work
revolutionary,

262
00:12:03,121 --> 00:12:04,354
I've already thanked you,

263
00:12:04,356 --> 00:12:05,855
and I hate repeating myself,

264
00:12:05,857 --> 00:12:07,824
so let's move on.

265
00:12:09,261 --> 00:12:11,294
Wait a minute,
are-are you saying that time

266
00:12:11,296 --> 00:12:13,863
has multiple dimensions,
the same as space?

267
00:12:13,865 --> 00:12:15,565
No. No, I'm
not saying it--

268
00:12:15,567 --> 00:12:17,067
the math is
saying it.

269
00:12:17,069 --> 00:12:19,002
Though it is the math
that I invented,

270
00:12:19,004 --> 00:12:21,338
so, yes, I guess I am saying it.

271
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:24,841
You understanding
any of this?

272
00:12:24,843 --> 00:12:29,612
I haven't understood
anything since poop tomato.

273
00:12:29,614 --> 00:12:31,147
My goodness,

274
00:12:31,149 --> 00:12:33,116
this is incredible.
See,

275
00:12:33,118 --> 00:12:35,251
I-I'm just not seeing
where string theory fits

276
00:12:35,253 --> 00:12:37,153
into all this, and that's
where I think that you and I

277
00:12:37,155 --> 00:12:38,621
could be of help to each other.

278
00:12:38,623 --> 00:12:40,190
Thank you. I'd be honored.

279
00:12:40,192 --> 00:12:43,126
All right. Allow me to show you
my most recent journal.

280
00:12:44,863 --> 00:12:46,996
Sheldon's right.

281
00:12:46,998 --> 00:12:49,165
This guy, this guy's brilliant.

282
00:12:49,167 --> 00:12:52,068
Yeah, I mean,
he's a little... kooky,

283
00:12:52,070 --> 00:12:54,237
but a mind
that can reconceptualize time

284
00:12:54,239 --> 00:12:55,905
probably has a reason
for keeping a jar

285
00:12:55,907 --> 00:12:58,375
of toenail clippings
that we just don't understand.

286
00:12:59,745 --> 00:13:02,645
I could spend months up here
just going through his math.

287
00:13:02,647 --> 00:13:03,780
I think Sheldon might.

288
00:13:03,782 --> 00:13:05,982
Great. Who's
gonna tell Amy

289
00:13:05,984 --> 00:13:09,319
we lost her fianc?
to a madman in the mountains?

290
00:13:10,722 --> 00:13:12,822
Hey, I drove.

291
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:17,093
This is so exciting.

292
00:13:17,095 --> 00:13:18,461
Can we do a body shot?

293
00:13:18,463 --> 00:13:20,330
I've always wanted
to do a body shot.

294
00:13:20,332 --> 00:13:22,932
Also, what's a body shot?

295
00:13:22,934 --> 00:13:25,329
It's when you take a drink out
of a stranger's belly button.

296
00:13:25,353 --> 00:13:25,970
Ew.

297
00:13:25,971 --> 00:13:26,970
No, thanks.

298
00:13:26,972 --> 00:13:28,304
What if they have an outie?

299
00:13:28,306 --> 00:13:30,340
Does it just spill everywhere?

300
00:13:30,342 --> 00:13:32,375
Okay, look,
we've got all night.

301
00:13:32,377 --> 00:13:34,077
Let's just take it easy.
We can...

302
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:35,378
I'm getting married!

303
00:13:37,716 --> 00:13:39,649
Here you go. First round
is on the house.

304
00:13:39,651 --> 00:13:41,217
- Ooh.
- Hey there.

305
00:13:41,219 --> 00:13:42,685
Do you do body shots?

306
00:13:42,687 --> 00:13:44,320
Oh, she said she
didn't want one.

307
00:13:44,322 --> 00:13:45,722
Mind your business.

308
00:13:45,724 --> 00:13:47,223
Cheers!

309
00:13:52,364 --> 00:13:54,364
Amy?

310
00:13:54,366 --> 00:13:56,533
Amy? Should we get her home?

311
00:13:56,535 --> 00:13:59,869
Why? She's sound asleep,
and we have sliders coming.

312
00:13:59,871 --> 00:14:01,871
One more round!

313
00:14:03,041 --> 00:14:05,041
So, how would this work

314
00:14:05,043 --> 00:14:06,810
in the context of
a singularity?

315
00:14:06,812 --> 00:14:09,312
Yes, that's-that's
a tricky bit to explain.

316
00:14:09,314 --> 00:14:12,248
I assume you're familiar
with non-abelian group theory.

317
00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:13,349
Oh, and how.

318
00:14:13,351 --> 00:14:15,251
You never forget your
first group theory.

319
00:14:15,253 --> 00:14:17,620
Listen, I'm gonna put on
a pot of coffee,

320
00:14:17,622 --> 00:14:19,789
because there is a lot
of math to go through.

321
00:14:19,791 --> 00:14:22,325
And he said he didn't want
a wild bachelor party.

322
00:14:22,327 --> 00:14:23,827
Excuse me?

323
00:14:23,829 --> 00:14:25,762
Oh, uh, Sheldon's
getting married in a month.

324
00:14:25,764 --> 00:14:26,863
Oh!

325
00:14:26,865 --> 00:14:28,398
Congratulations.

326
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:30,967
Yeah, I'm a
married man myself.

327
00:14:30,969 --> 00:14:31,968
Oh, really?
Is she here?

328
00:14:31,970 --> 00:14:34,270
And alive?

329
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:38,942
A-And can people other than you
see her?

330
00:14:40,645 --> 00:14:41,744
She lives in Munich.

331
00:14:41,746 --> 00:14:42,745
It's a perfect marriage.

332
00:14:42,747 --> 00:14:44,347
We focus
on our work

333
00:14:44,349 --> 00:14:46,883
and send each other cards
every year on our birthdays.

334
00:14:46,885 --> 00:14:49,486
Hey, wait,
what-what month is it?

335
00:14:49,488 --> 00:14:50,453
Uh, April.

336
00:14:50,455 --> 00:14:51,788
Most years.

337
00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:52,989
The point is

338
00:14:52,991 --> 00:14:54,190
we give each other space.

339
00:14:54,192 --> 00:14:56,593
I give her Europe,
she gives me South America.

340
00:14:56,595 --> 00:14:59,496
That's where she thinks
I'm living.

341
00:15:00,599 --> 00:15:04,434
I-I've never considered
a long-distance marriage.

342
00:15:04,436 --> 00:15:06,202
Well, listen, if you want
to be a great scientist,

343
00:15:06,204 --> 00:15:08,004
you can't afford
to be distracted.

344
00:15:08,006 --> 00:15:10,607
Hey, where are
my manners?

345
00:15:10,609 --> 00:15:12,375
You fellas
must be hungry.

346
00:15:12,377 --> 00:15:13,710
Do you like rabbit?

347
00:15:13,712 --> 00:15:15,311
- Yeah. - Sure.
- Sounds good.

348
00:15:15,313 --> 00:15:16,946
Okay.

349
00:15:16,948 --> 00:15:21,384
But can you tell the difference
between rabbit and squirrel?

350
00:15:21,386 --> 00:15:22,652
- No. - Don't think so.
- Probably not.

351
00:15:22,654 --> 00:15:24,988
Great!

352
00:15:24,990 --> 00:15:27,624
We're having rabbit.

353
00:15:29,461 --> 00:15:31,361
Be right back!

354
00:15:33,131 --> 00:15:35,999
It is amazing
how much he's accomplished

355
00:15:36,001 --> 00:15:39,802
by isolating himself from the
distractions of day-to-day life.

356
00:15:39,804 --> 00:15:42,372
Okay, please don't tell me
you want to live like this.

357
00:15:42,374 --> 00:15:44,574
See, that's
the strange thing.

358
00:15:44,576 --> 00:15:45,975
I don't.

359
00:15:45,977 --> 00:15:48,011
What is wrong with me?

360
00:15:48,013 --> 00:15:50,280
Why don't I want this?

361
00:15:50,282 --> 00:15:52,448
Look at how cool
it all is.

362
00:15:52,450 --> 00:15:55,585
Nothing is wrong with
you. You have friends,

363
00:15:55,587 --> 00:15:58,454
you have a fianc?e,
you have a full life.

364
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:01,891
You know what,

365
00:16:01,893 --> 00:16:03,660
you're right.

366
00:16:03,662 --> 00:16:07,697
Thank you
for bringing me up here.

367
00:16:07,699 --> 00:16:10,133
But I think
I'm ready to go home now.

368
00:16:10,135 --> 00:16:11,501
Really? You don't want
to stay for dinner

369
00:16:11,503 --> 00:16:12,869
and talk more science?

370
00:16:12,871 --> 00:16:14,203
No. No, we better go.

371
00:16:14,205 --> 00:16:15,805
I miss Amy.

372
00:16:15,807 --> 00:16:18,341
And my phone.

373
00:16:22,213 --> 00:16:24,547
Also, I'm from Texas,

374
00:16:24,549 --> 00:16:28,017
and I <i>can</i> taste the difference
between rabbit and squirrel.

375
00:16:35,794 --> 00:16:37,927
Oh, look who's back!

376
00:16:37,929 --> 00:16:39,596
There she is!

377
00:16:39,598 --> 00:16:42,432
What happened?
How did we get here?

378
00:16:42,434 --> 00:16:43,666
You don't remember anything?

379
00:16:43,668 --> 00:16:46,803
I remember taking some shots,
and then...

380
00:16:46,805 --> 00:16:48,371
that's it.

381
00:16:49,174 --> 00:16:51,207
Oh, my gosh, did I pass out?

382
00:16:51,209 --> 00:16:52,508
You kind of did.

383
00:16:52,510 --> 00:16:53,876
At my own bachelorette party?

384
00:16:53,878 --> 00:16:55,545
I'm so lame.

385
00:16:56,514 --> 00:16:58,781
Well, you didn't pass out
before you did

386
00:16:58,783 --> 00:17:00,383
all kinds of fun stuff.

387
00:17:00,385 --> 00:17:01,284
What did I do?

388
00:17:01,286 --> 00:17:03,953
What did you <i>do?</i>

389
00:17:03,955 --> 00:17:06,689
What'd she do?

390
00:17:06,691 --> 00:17:09,058
Um...

391
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:12,862
well, you don't remember
Riverdancing on top of the bar?

392
00:17:17,469 --> 00:17:18,968
I did that?

393
00:17:18,970 --> 00:17:20,003
Yeah, you did!

394
00:17:20,005 --> 00:17:21,938
Mm-hmm.

395
00:17:21,940 --> 00:17:24,674
But I don't know how
to Riverdance.

396
00:17:24,676 --> 00:17:28,411
Didn't stop you from teaching
all those shirtless firemen.

397
00:17:29,914 --> 00:17:32,482
I saw shirtless firemen?

398
00:17:32,484 --> 00:17:35,652
Saw, smelled,
slid down like a pole.

399
00:17:36,488 --> 00:17:38,588
Did I flash anybody?

400
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:41,324
How about <i>everybody?</i>

401
00:17:42,327 --> 00:17:44,394
I can't believe it.
I'm so embarrassed.

402
00:17:44,396 --> 00:17:47,463
You didn't take any pictures,
did you?

403
00:17:47,465 --> 00:17:49,032
Oh, no, we would
never do that to you.

404
00:17:49,034 --> 00:17:50,299
Yeah. But if there
were pictures,

405
00:17:50,301 --> 00:17:53,569
they would be <i>crazy.</i>

406
00:17:53,571 --> 00:17:56,139
- You guys are good friends.
- Mm.

407
00:18:08,053 --> 00:18:10,987
Dinner!

408
00:18:11,823 --> 00:18:14,023
Guys?

409
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:19,228
I can't believe they left
without saying good-bye.

410
00:18:19,230 --> 00:18:22,465
Wait a minute,
what if they stole my work?

411
00:18:22,467 --> 00:18:25,134
Wait a minute!

412
00:18:25,136 --> 00:18:27,503
What if they were never here
at all?

413
00:18:27,505 --> 00:18:29,072
Wait a minute!

414
00:18:29,074 --> 00:18:31,107
What if they haven't
gotten here yet

415
00:18:31,109 --> 00:18:33,910
but they're on their way?!

416
00:18:33,912 --> 00:18:36,379
I better tidy up.

417
00:18:45,552 --> 00:18:46,943
Hello.

418
00:18:46,944 --> 00:18:48,810
Welcome back. How'd it go?

419
00:18:48,812 --> 00:18:51,780
Well, Dr. Wolcott's theories
of time

420
00:18:51,782 --> 00:18:55,117
might save my new interpretation
of string theory.

421
00:18:55,119 --> 00:18:56,618
Oh, well, that's exciting.

422
00:18:56,620 --> 00:18:58,053
It is.

423
00:18:58,055 --> 00:19:00,055
How was your
bachelorette party?

424
00:19:00,057 --> 00:19:02,824
Well, I was in a bar,

425
00:19:02,826 --> 00:19:05,927
and I saw
some shirtless men.

426
00:19:05,929 --> 00:19:08,930
They were firemen,
and they fought over me.

427
00:19:10,234 --> 00:19:11,833
But Penny and Bernadette
got me out of there

428
00:19:11,835 --> 00:19:14,870
before the victor got my spoils.

429
00:19:16,206 --> 00:19:18,707
I see.

430
00:19:18,709 --> 00:19:20,142
What's the matter?

431
00:19:20,144 --> 00:19:22,444
You look glum.

432
00:19:22,446 --> 00:19:25,447
Amy, would you
still love me

433
00:19:25,449 --> 00:19:27,849
if I wasn't who
you thought I was?

434
00:19:27,851 --> 00:19:29,851
What are you talking about?

435
00:19:29,853 --> 00:19:32,187
Well, what if it turns out

436
00:19:32,189 --> 00:19:36,258
I'm not the single-minded,
science-obsessed recluse

437
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:39,194
who puts his work above
everything and everybody else

438
00:19:39,196 --> 00:19:40,662
that you fell in love with?

439
00:19:44,268 --> 00:19:46,535
What if I'm not
the straightlaced,

440
00:19:46,537 --> 00:19:49,237
buttoned-up, quilting queen
you thought I was?

441
00:19:50,140 --> 00:19:52,441
What if I'm a...

442
00:19:52,443 --> 00:19:55,911
Riverdancing wild woman?

443
00:20:01,385 --> 00:20:03,251
I'd still love you.

444
00:20:03,253 --> 00:20:05,487
I'd still love you, too.

445
00:20:06,924 --> 00:20:10,859
Do you really know
how to Riverdance?

446
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:18,033
You tell me.

447
00:20:29,613 --> 00:20:32,481
I'm the only man
you do that for.
