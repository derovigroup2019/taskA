1
00:00:01,872 --> 00:00:03,956
All right, Saturday
is the big day.

2
00:00:03,958 --> 00:00:05,924
A lot of people thought
this would never come.

3
00:00:05,926 --> 00:00:07,960
I may have been
one of those people.

4
00:00:08,763 --> 00:00:11,296
I may have been
one of those people.

5
00:00:11,298 --> 00:00:12,631
Wait, wait, are we talking
about the wedding?

6
00:00:12,633 --> 00:00:13,112
Yes.

7
00:00:13,136 --> 00:00:15,018
Oh, yeah, I was definitely
one of those people.

8
00:00:15,019 --> 00:00:16,435
And yet, here we are.

9
00:00:16,437 --> 00:00:18,604
Now, we got a lot of family
coming in tomorrow.

10
00:00:18,606 --> 00:00:19,888
I'm gonna need everyone's help.

11
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:21,974
Think of this as one of
your comic book movies.

12
00:00:21,976 --> 00:00:24,143
There's a bunch of superheroes,
each with a different task.

13
00:00:24,145 --> 00:00:25,644
Oh, like
the new Avengers.

14
00:00:25,646 --> 00:00:26,862
Which one was that?

15
00:00:26,864 --> 00:00:29,198
The one you slept through
last weekend.

16
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:31,984
Oh, that was
a good nap.

17
00:00:31,986 --> 00:00:35,654
I-I think it's more like, uh,
like Lord of the Rings,

18
00:00:35,656 --> 00:00:36,955
and you're the Fellowship.

19
00:00:36,957 --> 00:00:38,791
Uh, someone's
got to go to Gondor,

20
00:00:38,793 --> 00:00:40,209
someone's got to go to Mordor,

21
00:00:40,211 --> 00:00:42,745
someone's got to hold off
the demon of shadow and flame.

22
00:00:42,747 --> 00:00:44,129
You mean the Balrog?

23
00:00:44,131 --> 00:00:46,465
I mean my mother.

24
00:00:46,467 --> 00:00:48,000
That is a perfect
metaphor, Amy.

25
00:00:48,002 --> 00:00:49,384
Thank you.

26
00:00:49,386 --> 00:00:51,303
Because it also involves a ring

27
00:00:51,305 --> 00:00:54,256
that binds me
in servitude forever.

28
00:00:54,258 --> 00:00:55,443
Aw, he said forever.

00:01:23,199 --> 00:01:24,289
That was Wil Wheaton.

40
00:01:24,290 --> 00:01:26,424
He's really excited
about tomorrow.

41
00:01:26,426 --> 00:01:28,159
As am I.

42
00:01:28,161 --> 00:01:31,712
If you'd have told me as a child
that an actor from Star Trek

43
00:01:31,714 --> 00:01:34,432
would be officiating my wedding,
I would've said,

44
00:01:34,434 --> 00:01:36,851
"Ooh, William Shatner?"

45
00:01:37,871 --> 00:01:39,637
And if you'd have said,
"No, Wil Wheaton,"

46
00:01:39,639 --> 00:01:41,939
I'd have said, "Well, did you
even try William Shatner?"

47
00:01:41,941 --> 00:01:43,558
And if you'd have said,

48
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:45,643
"Yes, but he costs too much
money," I'd have said,

49
00:01:45,645 --> 00:01:47,645
"Ah, well,
Wil Wheaton's good, too."

50
00:01:47,647 --> 00:01:50,481
Why do you keep tying
and untying that bow tie?

51
00:01:50,483 --> 00:01:52,984
I can't seem to get it even.

52
00:01:52,986 --> 00:01:54,869
Well, I don't think
it's supposed to be even.

53
00:01:54,871 --> 00:01:56,787
Sometimes a little asymmetry
looks good.

54
00:01:56,789 --> 00:01:59,073
In the Renaissance,
they called it "sprezzatura."

55
00:01:59,075 --> 00:02:00,908
The Renaissance?

56
00:02:00,910 --> 00:02:04,128
Amy, you know I'm more
of an Enlightenment person.

57
00:02:04,130 --> 00:02:05,830
At some point, we have to decide

58
00:02:05,832 --> 00:02:07,999
how we want to raise
the children.

59
00:02:08,001 --> 00:02:11,135
So are you feeling okay?

60
00:02:11,137 --> 00:02:13,254
No wedding jitters?

61
00:02:13,256 --> 00:02:14,422
No.

62
00:02:14,424 --> 00:02:16,340
There is nothing
in the world

63
00:02:16,342 --> 00:02:18,142
that would stop me from
marrying you tomorrow,

64
00:02:18,144 --> 00:02:22,680
even me from the future coming
back to prevent the wedding

65
00:02:22,682 --> 00:02:26,567
and the subsequent birth of a
child who will destroy humanity.

66
00:02:26,569 --> 00:02:29,070
Because if you came
from the future,

67
00:02:29,072 --> 00:02:31,189
that would mean you already
went through with the wedding

68
00:02:31,191 --> 00:02:33,858
because you believe that
time travel is on a closed loop.

69
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:36,527
I love you
so damn much.

70
00:02:41,334 --> 00:02:43,034
Uh, Mr. Fowler,
are you okay back there?

71
00:02:43,036 --> 00:02:44,202
Do you need more air?

72
00:02:44,204 --> 00:02:46,671
He's fine.

73
00:02:47,707 --> 00:02:49,624
I'm surprised
Amy didn't pick us up.

74
00:02:49,626 --> 00:02:51,259
Oh, well, you know,

75
00:02:51,261 --> 00:02:53,377
she's pretty busy the
day before her wedding.

76
00:02:53,379 --> 00:02:56,847
Too busy for her mother?

77
00:02:56,849 --> 00:02:59,467
She used to be
such a devoted daughter.

78
00:02:59,469 --> 00:03:03,721
Now she's just waiting for me
to die so she can get my china.

79
00:03:07,977 --> 00:03:10,561
Thank you again
for picking us up.

80
00:03:10,563 --> 00:03:12,730
My pleasure, Mrs. Cooper.

81
00:03:12,732 --> 00:03:14,532
You know,
our driver to the airport

82
00:03:14,534 --> 00:03:16,867
was also a Indian fella.

83
00:03:16,869 --> 00:03:18,452
Mom...

84
00:03:18,454 --> 00:03:21,822
Oh, so now it's racist to notice
when somebody's Indian.

85
00:03:21,824 --> 00:03:26,294
I don't think it's racist.
I noticed you were both white.

86
00:03:26,296 --> 00:03:30,214
See? You'll have
to excuse her.

87
00:03:30,216 --> 00:03:32,133
She's just pregnant
and hormonal.

88
00:03:32,135 --> 00:03:35,553
Oh, yeah, congratulations
on baby number two.

89
00:03:35,555 --> 00:03:39,307
Yeah. Whoopie.

90
00:03:39,309 --> 00:03:41,092
Her husband would be here,

91
00:03:41,094 --> 00:03:43,594
but he stayed home
to watch their older son,

92
00:03:43,596 --> 00:03:47,014
so e-everything's fine!

93
00:03:47,016 --> 00:03:48,566
Stop it.

94
00:03:48,568 --> 00:03:51,485
We're separated.

95
00:03:51,487 --> 00:03:54,238
You don't say.

96
00:03:55,275 --> 00:03:57,942
So, you're Sheldon's
big brother.

97
00:03:57,944 --> 00:04:00,027
Uh, yeah.
He got the brains.

98
00:04:00,029 --> 00:04:02,663
I got the bod.

99
00:04:02,665 --> 00:04:04,949
And the face and the hair.

100
00:04:04,951 --> 00:04:06,951
I like your accent.

101
00:04:06,953 --> 00:04:09,370
Sheldon, did you
used to sound like that?

102
00:04:09,372 --> 00:04:11,005
Can you still?

103
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:17,795
I can. I will not.

104
00:04:17,797 --> 00:04:20,965
Amy, you said something
about my bow tie

105
00:04:20,967 --> 00:04:22,967
that I can't stop
thinking about.

106
00:04:22,969 --> 00:04:24,385
Don't you mean...

107
00:04:24,387 --> 00:04:27,188
"Y'all said
something 'bout my bow tie"?

108
00:04:29,142 --> 00:04:31,192
Go on, say it.

109
00:04:31,194 --> 00:04:33,194
Say it.

110
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:36,731
Hey, guys, look who I have.

111
00:04:36,733 --> 00:04:38,065
- Oh.
- Hey.

112
00:04:38,067 --> 00:04:39,483
Hey, Shelly.

113
00:04:39,485 --> 00:04:42,787
I'm so glad you made it, Missy.
This is my fianc?e, Amy.

114
00:04:42,789 --> 00:04:44,705
Amy, this is my sister.

115
00:04:44,707 --> 00:04:47,208
If I ever need a kidney,
this is where you get it.

116
00:04:48,494 --> 00:04:50,378
- It's so nice to meet you.
- ?Aw.

117
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:52,413
I've always wanted a sister.

118
00:04:52,415 --> 00:04:53,831
Really? Why?

119
00:04:53,833 --> 00:04:56,217
I love you, too, Sheldon.

120
00:04:56,219 --> 00:04:58,052
Really? Why?

121
00:04:59,172 --> 00:05:00,504
Where's Mom?

122
00:05:00,506 --> 00:05:03,224
Uh, she wanted to stop by
the hotel and freshen up,

123
00:05:03,226 --> 00:05:06,727
and then call her pastor
to pray for Missy's soul.

124
00:05:06,729 --> 00:05:08,896
Oh, my God.

125
00:05:11,684 --> 00:05:13,768
There's mama's girl.

126
00:05:13,770 --> 00:05:15,519
- Hi, Mom.
- ?Oh!

127
00:05:15,521 --> 00:05:18,823
Oh, Larry, look at her!

128
00:05:18,825 --> 00:05:22,360
Can you believe our little lamb
is finally getting married?

129
00:05:22,362 --> 00:05:25,329
He can't believe it.

130
00:05:25,331 --> 00:05:27,415
And neither can I.

131
00:05:27,417 --> 00:05:29,784
Hi, Dad. How you doing?

132
00:05:36,759 --> 00:05:38,843
What the hell is that?

133
00:05:38,845 --> 00:05:40,711
Come on, you know this one.

134
00:05:40,713 --> 00:05:43,264
It's a... dog.

135
00:05:43,883 --> 00:05:45,099
I found him in the backyard.

136
00:05:45,101 --> 00:05:46,884
And don't worry,
I already called the owner.

137
00:05:46,886 --> 00:05:48,719
Good, 'cause
we don't need a dog.

138
00:05:48,721 --> 00:05:51,555
We already have two babies,
you and Stuart.

139
00:05:53,559 --> 00:05:55,693
That's probably him.

140
00:05:59,482 --> 00:06:01,649
Hi.

141
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:06,203
I'm gonna need a minute.

142
00:06:09,876 --> 00:06:13,077
That's Mark Hamill!

143
00:06:20,753 --> 00:06:23,254
Hello.

144
00:06:23,256 --> 00:06:27,508
Thank you so much
for finding this guy.

145
00:06:27,510 --> 00:06:29,260
Oh, my goodness.

146
00:06:29,262 --> 00:06:31,762
Hey, Bark. How are you, buddy?

147
00:06:31,764 --> 00:06:34,932
Y-Your dog's name is Bark?

148
00:06:34,934 --> 00:06:36,183
Yeah.

149
00:06:36,185 --> 00:06:38,319
Bark Hamill?

150
00:06:38,321 --> 00:06:41,439
Yeah. Well, I let the fans
name him online.

151
00:06:41,441 --> 00:06:42,823
I got lucky, though.

152
00:06:42,825 --> 00:06:44,942
He was almost
Honey Baked Hamill.

153
00:06:45,828 --> 00:06:47,111
Anyway, thanks so much.

154
00:06:47,113 --> 00:06:49,280
I-I want to give you a reward
for finding him.

155
00:06:49,282 --> 00:06:51,665
Oh, no, I
couldn't take your money.

156
00:06:51,667 --> 00:06:53,534
It's just an honor
to meet you.

157
00:06:53,536 --> 00:06:57,171
No. No, please. You don't know
what this dog means to me,

158
00:06:57,173 --> 00:06:59,340
and I thought
he was gone for good.

159
00:06:59,342 --> 00:07:02,376
Please? There must be
something I can do for you.

160
00:07:02,378 --> 00:07:03,794
Anything.

161
00:07:03,796 --> 00:07:07,298
Oh, you're gonna regret
that.

162
00:07:09,969 --> 00:07:11,635
Hey, dude.

163
00:07:11,637 --> 00:07:12,803
Dude?

164
00:07:12,805 --> 00:07:15,222
Yeah, you know,
just want you to know

165
00:07:15,224 --> 00:07:17,141
that I don't think
of you as a woman.

166
00:07:17,143 --> 00:07:20,311
Oh, perfect. I don't
think of you as a man.

167
00:07:20,313 --> 00:07:21,529
Great.

168
00:07:21,531 --> 00:07:24,315
So, as two genderless blobs
of human flesh,

169
00:07:24,317 --> 00:07:25,983
how would you like to go

170
00:07:25,985 --> 00:07:27,735
to Sheldon and Amy's wedding
with me?

171
00:07:27,737 --> 00:07:29,487
Oh, Stuart.

172
00:07:29,489 --> 00:07:32,206
Look, I appreciate that,
but it just might be

173
00:07:32,208 --> 00:07:33,958
a little weird,
considering you're my boss.

174
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:36,243
Guess who's gonna officiate
Sheldon and Amy's wedding!

175
00:07:36,245 --> 00:07:38,579
Mark Hamill!

176
00:07:38,581 --> 00:07:40,965
Luke Skywalker
is gonna be at the wedding!

177
00:07:40,967 --> 00:07:43,167
You'll need to
buy me a dress.

178
00:07:45,338 --> 00:07:47,004
And did you know
that my Amy

179
00:07:47,006 --> 00:07:49,056
played Amelia Earhart
in the eighth grade?

180
00:07:49,058 --> 00:07:51,342
Amy, you never said you
were in a school play.

181
00:07:51,344 --> 00:07:52,560
Oh, no, no, at home.

182
00:07:52,562 --> 00:07:55,479
I'd never let her
do a school play.

183
00:07:55,481 --> 00:07:59,483
Those kids just take drugs
and have intercourse.

184
00:08:02,104 --> 00:08:05,105
You know, Amy still
does some performing.

185
00:08:05,107 --> 00:08:07,525
She and Sheldon do an
Internet show about flags.

186
00:08:07,527 --> 00:08:09,527
Amy?

187
00:08:09,529 --> 00:08:13,163
V-Videos on the Internet?

188
00:08:13,165 --> 00:08:16,617
You know what men
use those for.

189
00:08:16,619 --> 00:08:18,502
If you're talking about
Fun with Flags,

190
00:08:18,504 --> 00:08:21,255
I use it to go to sleep.

191
00:08:21,257 --> 00:08:23,040
Sheldon,
you're awfully quiet.

192
00:08:23,042 --> 00:08:24,375
Are you okay?

193
00:08:24,377 --> 00:08:26,126
Oh. Oh, I'm sorry.

194
00:08:26,128 --> 00:08:28,212
I was thinking about
string theory.

195
00:08:28,214 --> 00:08:31,048
But catch me up.
What'd I miss?

196
00:08:31,050 --> 00:08:33,050
Are you seeing
this, Larry?

197
00:08:33,052 --> 00:08:35,719
These are the people I'm
gonna have to live with

198
00:08:35,721 --> 00:08:37,555
after you're dead.

199
00:08:42,903 --> 00:08:45,036
Welcome, Bert.
Don't you look nice.

200
00:08:45,038 --> 00:08:48,456
Yeah. Like a geode,
I clean up good.

201
00:08:48,458 --> 00:08:51,543
Don't you crack a geode open?

202
00:08:51,545 --> 00:08:54,329
It's not a perfect metaphor.

203
00:08:55,248 --> 00:08:57,131
Oh, my God.

204
00:08:57,133 --> 00:08:58,500
- Is that Mark Hamill?
- ?Yeah.

205
00:08:58,502 --> 00:08:59,467
Oh, my God.

206
00:08:59,469 --> 00:09:02,053
- Is that...
- Bert, go find your seat!

207
00:09:03,473 --> 00:09:04,806
W-What is he doing here?

208
00:09:04,808 --> 00:09:06,090
I found his dog

209
00:09:06,092 --> 00:09:08,142
and guilted him into
officiating the wedding.

210
00:09:08,144 --> 00:09:09,894
Don't tell Sheldon.
It's a surprise.

211
00:09:09,896 --> 00:09:11,896
Wait, I-I thought
Wil was officiating the wedding.

212
00:09:11,898 --> 00:09:13,648
Yeah, so did he.

213
00:09:13,650 --> 00:09:15,266
How did he take the news?

214
00:09:15,268 --> 00:09:16,601
I'll let you know.

215
00:09:16,603 --> 00:09:18,820
Hey, Wil!

216
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:26,494
Are you having an allergic
reaction to my boutonniere?

217
00:09:26,496 --> 00:09:30,081
No. I'm just so
happy for you.

218
00:09:30,083 --> 00:09:31,950
And for me.

219
00:09:31,952 --> 00:09:33,952
After today, you
are officially--

220
00:09:33,954 --> 00:09:38,456
and, more important,
legally-- Amy's problem.

221
00:09:38,458 --> 00:09:40,959
Don't be silly, Leonard.

222
00:09:40,961 --> 00:09:44,262
I will always be your problem.

223
00:09:50,937 --> 00:09:52,720
Hey, baby.

224
00:09:52,722 --> 00:09:54,222
Hello, Mother.

225
00:09:54,224 --> 00:09:55,807
Leonard, could you
give us a moment?

226
00:09:55,809 --> 00:09:57,525
Oh, of course.

227
00:09:58,945 --> 00:10:01,479
Oh, Shelly.

228
00:10:04,085 --> 00:10:06,835
I wish your dad
could see you now.

229
00:10:06,837 --> 00:10:10,339
Me, too. I miss him.

230
00:10:10,341 --> 00:10:12,808
He would be so
proud of you.

231
00:10:12,810 --> 00:10:14,727
I know that I am.

232
00:10:14,729 --> 00:10:16,178
Thank you.

233
00:10:18,015 --> 00:10:19,848
I mean, for everything.

234
00:10:19,850 --> 00:10:21,817
My whole life.

235
00:10:24,021 --> 00:10:25,521
Oh.

236
00:10:27,658 --> 00:10:29,358
Let me
straighten your tie.

237
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:30,943
No, no, no, it's all right.

238
00:10:30,945 --> 00:10:33,412
It's supposed to be
a little asymmetrical.

239
00:10:33,414 --> 00:10:37,249
Apparently, a small flaw
somehow improves it.

240
00:10:37,251 --> 00:10:38,867
I can see that.

241
00:10:38,869 --> 00:10:42,788
Sometimes it's the...

242
00:10:42,790 --> 00:10:47,876
imperfect stuff that
makes things perfect.

243
00:10:49,930 --> 00:10:51,797
Excuse me.

244
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:59,722
Case in point.

245
00:11:00,975 --> 00:11:04,193
So, we finally meet.

246
00:11:04,195 --> 00:11:07,863
I'm sorry, who are you?

247
00:11:07,865 --> 00:11:10,399
I'm Wil Wheaton.

248
00:11:10,401 --> 00:11:12,868
I was supposed
to officiate this wedding.

249
00:11:12,870 --> 00:11:15,321
I was up all night
preparing these notes.

250
00:11:15,323 --> 00:11:19,241
Well, thanks so much.
It's gonna be a great help.

251
00:11:23,047 --> 00:11:24,079
Amy.

252
00:11:24,081 --> 00:11:25,414
Amy.

253
00:11:25,416 --> 00:11:27,466
Amy.

254
00:11:27,468 --> 00:11:29,251
Come in.

255
00:11:29,253 --> 00:11:31,420
There's something
I need to tell you.

256
00:11:31,422 --> 00:11:33,389
Wow, you look amazing!

257
00:11:33,391 --> 00:11:35,391
That's not what I need
to tell you.

258
00:11:35,393 --> 00:11:37,343
But you do!
What's wrong?

259
00:11:37,345 --> 00:11:39,061
Something incredible
just happened.

260
00:11:39,063 --> 00:11:41,146
Remember when you were
telling me about my bow tie

261
00:11:41,148 --> 00:11:43,899
and how a little asymmetry
is good?

262
00:11:43,901 --> 00:11:46,435
- Yeah?
- My equations have been trying

263
00:11:46,437 --> 00:11:48,070
to describe an imperfect world,

264
00:11:48,072 --> 00:11:50,773
and the only way to do that
is to introduce imperfection

265
00:11:50,775 --> 00:11:52,107
into the underlying theory.

266
00:11:52,109 --> 00:11:55,744
So, instead of supersymmetry,

267
00:11:55,746 --> 00:11:58,614
it would be super asymmetry?

268
00:11:58,616 --> 00:12:00,949
Super asymmetry.

269
00:12:00,951 --> 00:12:01,937
That's it!

270
00:12:03,411 --> 00:12:05,454
- Give me your lipstick.
- What?

271
00:12:04,935 --> 00:12:05,937
Just give it to me,
you beautiful thing!

272
00:12:05,937 --> 00:12:07,795
We have work to do!

273
00:12:10,177 --> 00:12:12,378
Hey, uh, the
bride and groom

274
00:12:12,380 --> 00:12:14,546
seem to be running
a little behind.

275
00:12:14,548 --> 00:12:16,131
Do you think
you could stall?

276
00:12:16,133 --> 00:12:18,967
Stall? How?

277
00:12:18,969 --> 00:12:20,803
Hey, everybody!

278
00:12:20,805 --> 00:12:22,721
Uh, it's gonna be a few
more minutes, but while we wait,

279
00:12:22,723 --> 00:12:25,941
does anyone have any
questions about Star Wars?

280
00:12:32,817 --> 00:12:34,700
You got this.

281
00:12:37,121 --> 00:12:39,872
So if I make
slightly asymmetric knots

282
00:12:39,874 --> 00:12:41,373
with sheets in four dimensions,

283
00:12:41,375 --> 00:12:43,492
I can bootstrap
the whole idea

284
00:12:43,494 --> 00:12:46,078
to a large asymmetry
in 11 dimensions.

285
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:48,464
Maybe even at
the initial moment of creation,

286
00:12:48,466 --> 00:12:50,416
the fundamental forces
lacked symmetry.

287
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:54,887
Everyone's waiting.
What are you guys doing?

288
00:12:54,889 --> 00:12:56,138
Super asymmetry.

289
00:12:56,140 --> 00:12:58,173
Super asymmetry?
Is that a thing?

290
00:12:58,175 --> 00:13:00,008
We're inventing
it right now.

291
00:13:00,010 --> 00:13:02,511
Don't you think
this can wait until...

292
00:13:02,513 --> 00:13:04,179
Hold on.

293
00:13:04,181 --> 00:13:07,149
This is interesting.

294
00:13:08,269 --> 00:13:10,018
So, yeah, Mr. Mark?

295
00:13:11,071 --> 00:13:13,655
When you were on the,
uh, Wookiee home planet,

296
00:13:13,657 --> 00:13:16,492
how did you even understand
what they were saying?

297
00:13:16,494 --> 00:13:20,078
I don't remember ever being
on a Wookiee home planet.

298
00:13:21,282 --> 00:13:23,866
Uh, actually, Luke was
on the Wookiee home planet,

299
00:13:23,868 --> 00:13:25,834
Kashyyyk, in the
Holiday Special

300
00:13:25,836 --> 00:13:29,288
when he helped Chewie
get home to his wife.

301
00:13:30,124 --> 00:13:32,207
Chewie had a wife?

302
00:13:32,209 --> 00:13:34,543
Her name's Malla.

303
00:13:34,545 --> 00:13:36,879
Wow, that's impressive.

304
00:13:36,881 --> 00:13:39,381
Yeah.

305
00:13:39,383 --> 00:13:41,633
Hey, uh, I got a question.

306
00:13:41,635 --> 00:13:45,721
Why aren't there tires on
any of those Star Wars vehicles?

307
00:13:47,224 --> 00:13:50,058
I'm sure some of them had tires.

308
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:51,810
Actually, they don't.

309
00:13:51,812 --> 00:13:55,781
I mean, the HAVw A5 turbo tank
has metal gripping wheels,

310
00:13:55,783 --> 00:13:58,784
but I wouldn't call them tires.

311
00:13:58,786 --> 00:14:02,821
You are so hot.

312
00:14:06,377 --> 00:14:09,578
This is taking too long.

313
00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:12,247
I bet that Sheldon
stood my baby up.

314
00:14:12,249 --> 00:14:13,916
Uh, excuse me.

315
00:14:13,918 --> 00:14:14,883
Where-where are you going?

316
00:14:14,885 --> 00:14:17,085
This whole thing
was a big mistake.

317
00:14:17,087 --> 00:14:18,253
I'm gonna find Amy

318
00:14:18,255 --> 00:14:20,672
and get her out of here.
- ?Sit down!

319
00:14:22,059 --> 00:14:24,059
Excuse me?

320
00:14:24,061 --> 00:14:25,644
Sheldon loves Amy,

321
00:14:25,646 --> 00:14:27,980
and he would never hurt her
on her wedding day

322
00:14:27,982 --> 00:14:30,098
or any other day, so park it.

323
00:14:36,991 --> 00:14:39,241
Oh, you sit down, too.

324
00:14:40,611 --> 00:14:43,111
Are you gonna let her
talk to me like that?

325
00:14:43,113 --> 00:14:45,113
Say something.

326
00:14:45,115 --> 00:14:47,533
Thank you.

327
00:14:50,204 --> 00:14:51,787
Uh, according
to Google, there are

328
00:14:51,789 --> 00:14:54,122
zero papers
that mention super asymmetry.

329
00:14:54,124 --> 00:14:56,291
This is brand-new.
No one's thought of it.

330
00:14:57,795 --> 00:15:00,095
What are you lunatics doing?!

331
00:15:00,097 --> 00:15:01,930
Sheldon had a breakthrough.

332
00:15:01,932 --> 00:15:04,299
Actually, Amy and I
had a breakthrough.

333
00:15:04,301 --> 00:15:06,552
Oh, science? Shocking!

334
00:15:07,721 --> 00:15:09,888
You don't understand.
This could be really big.

335
00:15:09,890 --> 00:15:11,807
No, Penny's right.

336
00:15:11,809 --> 00:15:15,143
We have our whole lives
to do science together.

337
00:15:16,981 --> 00:15:18,697
Let's get married.

338
00:15:18,699 --> 00:15:19,781
All right.

339
00:15:19,783 --> 00:15:21,149
It's go time!

340
00:15:21,151 --> 00:15:23,318
I am pumped!

341
00:15:27,206 --> 00:15:29,956
Okay, everyone. Here we go.

342
00:15:32,711 --> 00:15:34,377
Leonard.

343
00:15:34,379 --> 00:15:39,216
That's Mark Ha-Ha-Ha...

344
00:15:40,686 --> 00:15:43,720
It's-it's Mark Hami-Ha-Ha...

345
00:15:43,722 --> 00:15:47,224
Yep. Thank Wolowitz.
He set it up.

346
00:15:47,226 --> 00:15:49,359
Thank you.

347
00:15:50,812 --> 00:15:52,979
Congratulations
on your wedding.

348
00:15:52,981 --> 00:15:54,564
Thank you.

349
00:15:54,566 --> 00:15:58,068
When this is over, I have
4,000 things for you to sign.

350
00:16:16,237 --> 00:16:18,404
Thank you, Daddy.

351
00:16:23,828 --> 00:16:26,295
I-I thought Wil was marrying us.

352
00:16:26,297 --> 00:16:28,881
Wolowitz got us an upgrade.

353
00:16:30,168 --> 00:16:32,251
Another sci-fi
guy with a beard.

354
00:16:32,253 --> 00:16:35,254
Seems lateral, but okay.

355
00:16:35,256 --> 00:16:36,889
Welcome.

356
00:16:36,891 --> 00:16:38,891
We are gathered here today

357
00:16:38,893 --> 00:16:42,895
in the sight of family,
friends and Almighty God.

358
00:16:42,897 --> 00:16:44,680
That's too religious.

359
00:16:44,682 --> 00:16:47,066
That lady over there
made me say it.

360
00:16:47,068 --> 00:16:51,437
He heard you,
and he can't un-hear you.

361
00:16:54,409 --> 00:16:57,243
We're here
to celebrate the marriage

362
00:16:57,245 --> 00:16:59,245
of Sheldon Lee Cooper...

363
00:17:00,582 --> 00:17:02,114
...and Amy Farrah Fowler.

364
00:17:02,116 --> 00:17:03,783
I had more prepared,

365
00:17:03,785 --> 00:17:06,168
but I'm just gonna skip
to the rings and vows,

366
00:17:06,170 --> 00:17:09,705
since I've been answering
your questions for 45 minutes.

367
00:17:09,707 --> 00:17:13,459
Yeah, he answered 'em.

368
00:17:13,461 --> 00:17:16,629
Amy, you're up.

369
00:17:20,718 --> 00:17:24,887
Sheldon, when I
was a little girl,

370
00:17:24,889 --> 00:17:27,390
I used to dream
about my wedding.

371
00:17:27,392 --> 00:17:29,358
But, eventually,
I stopped,

372
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:32,945
because I thought that
day would never come.

373
00:17:32,947 --> 00:17:35,698
And then I met you.

374
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:38,150
From the first moment
in that coffee shop,

375
00:17:38,152 --> 00:17:41,537
I knew that there was
something special between us,

376
00:17:41,539 --> 00:17:43,623
even though I did
work on a study

377
00:17:43,625 --> 00:17:46,158
that disproved love
at first sight.

378
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:50,212
I loved that study
the moment I read it.

379
00:17:50,214 --> 00:17:51,797
Ironic, huh?

380
00:17:53,134 --> 00:17:56,252
Clearly, it was wrong.

381
00:17:56,254 --> 00:17:59,555
Because I felt
something that day,

382
00:17:59,557 --> 00:18:02,975
and those feelings have only
gotten stronger with time.

383
00:18:04,812 --> 00:18:08,597
I can't imagine loving you
more than I do right now.

384
00:18:08,599 --> 00:18:13,152
But I felt that way yesterday
and the day before yesterday

385
00:18:13,154 --> 00:18:15,855
and the day before that.

386
00:18:15,857 --> 00:18:19,325
Is that growth linear
or accelerating?

387
00:18:19,327 --> 00:18:19,957
Accelerating.

388
00:18:19,957 --> 00:18:21,957
Oh, maybe we could
graph it out.

389
00:18:23,533 --> 00:18:26,751
Save something
for the honeymoon.

390
00:18:26,753 --> 00:18:27,869
Smart.

391
00:18:29,923 --> 00:18:31,756
Sheldon,

392
00:18:31,758 --> 00:18:34,626
I don't know
what the future holds,

393
00:18:34,628 --> 00:18:38,046
but I know that I've never
been happier than I am

394
00:18:38,048 --> 00:18:41,466
in this moment marrying you.

395
00:18:43,386 --> 00:18:47,055
Well, that was
unexpectedly beautiful.

396
00:18:49,392 --> 00:18:51,559
I might need a minute.

397
00:18:58,318 --> 00:19:01,069
Amy...

398
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:07,659
...I usually know
exactly what to say.

399
00:19:07,661 --> 00:19:11,246
But in this moment...

400
00:19:11,248 --> 00:19:13,915
I have no words.

401
00:19:15,969 --> 00:19:18,887
I guess...

402
00:19:20,674 --> 00:19:23,007
I'm overwhelmed by you.

403
00:19:24,477 --> 00:19:26,427
In a good way.

404
00:19:26,429 --> 00:19:29,731
Not in the elevator
in the Haunted Mansion way.

405
00:19:30,684 --> 00:19:37,105
Even if I can't
tell you now how I feel,

406
00:19:37,107 --> 00:19:42,026
I will spend my life showing you
how much I love you.

407
00:19:46,917 --> 00:19:49,751
Do you...

408
00:19:51,838 --> 00:19:54,038
Do you...

409
00:19:55,425 --> 00:19:59,127
Hey, I'm just saying, I'm here
if you need me to step in.

410
00:19:59,129 --> 00:20:00,878
No, no, no.

411
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:02,797
I got this.

412
00:20:04,301 --> 00:20:08,636
Amy, do you take Sheldon
for your lawful wedded husband?

413
00:20:08,638 --> 00:20:10,805
I do.

414
00:20:10,807 --> 00:20:13,308
And, Sheldon, same thing.

415
00:20:16,479 --> 00:20:18,563
I do.

416
00:20:19,316 --> 00:20:21,366
Then by the power vested in me

417
00:20:21,368 --> 00:20:24,652
by
EvenYouCanPerformWeddings.com...

418
00:20:26,156 --> 00:20:29,073
...I now pronounce you
husband and wife.

419
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:31,993
You may kiss the bride.

420
00:20:41,171 --> 00:20:46,808
? At wast... ?

421
00:20:47,927 --> 00:20:52,146
? My wove has come awong ?

422
00:20:54,567 --> 00:20:58,736

00:21:01,691 --> 00:21:05,860
