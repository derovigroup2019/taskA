1
00:00:01,170 --> 00:00:03,830
you know,I've been thinking
about time travel again.

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:06,650
Why,did you hit a
roadblock with invisibility?

3
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:10,210
Put it on the back burner.

4
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:13,760
Anyway,it occurs to me if I
ever did perfect a time machine,

5
00:00:13,770 --> 00:00:15,980
I would just go into the
past and give it to myself,

6
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:19,640
thus eliminating the need for me
to invent it in the first place.

7
00:00:20,510 --> 00:00:21,350
Interesting.

8
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:23,540
Yeah,it really takes the pressure off.

9
00:00:24,530 --> 00:00:26,160
Sounds like a breakthrough.

10
00:00:26,170 --> 00:00:28,760
Should I call science magazine
and tell them to hold the cover?

11
00:00:28,770 --> 00:00:31,640
It's time travel,leonard,I
will have already done that.

12
00:00:33,020 --> 00:00:35,200
Then I guess
congratulations are in order.

13
00:00:35,210 --> 00:00:38,770
No,congratulations
will have been in order.

14
00:00:39,230 --> 00:00:41,310
You know,I am not going
to enjoy this party.

15
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:43,860
I know,I'm familiar with you.

16
00:00:43,870 --> 00:00:48,960
The last department party,professor finkleday
cornered me and talked about spelunking for 45 minutes.

17
00:00:48,970 --> 00:00:50,250
Yes,I was there.

18
00:00:50,260 --> 00:00:52,170
You know what's interesting
about caves,leonard?

19
00:00:52,180 --> 00:00:53,870
- What?
- Nothing.

20
00:00:55,470 --> 00:00:58,140
Well,then we'll avoid finkleday,we'll
meet the new department head,

21
00:00:58,150 --> 00:00:59,920
congratulate him,shake his hand and go.

22
00:00:59,930 --> 00:01:01,060
How's this?

23
00:01:01,070 --> 00:01:03,020
"Pleased to meet you,dr.Gablehauser.

24
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:05,990
"How fortunate for you that the
university's "chosen to hire you,

25
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,340
despite the fact "that you've done
no original research in 25 years,

26
00:01:09,350 --> 00:01:11,510
"and instead have written
a series of popular books "

27
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:14,450
that reduce the great concepts of
science "to a series of anecdotes,

28
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:19,630
"each one dumbed down to accommodate the
duration "of an average bowel movement.

29
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:22,320
Mahalo.

30
00:01:25,310 --> 00:01:27,660
" "Mahalo's" a nice touch.

31
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:30,700
You know there only eight
consonants in the hawaiian language?

32
00:01:30,710 --> 00:01:33,000
Interesting. You should lead with that.

33
00:01:35,010 --> 00:01:37,110
Oh,god,look at this buffet.

34
00:01:38,050 --> 00:01:39,780
I love america.

35
00:01:39,790 --> 00:01:41,440
You don't have buffets in india?

36
00:01:41,450 --> 00:01:43,820
Of course,but it's all indian food.

37
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:47,510
You can't find a bagel in
mumbai to save your life.

38
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,430
Shmear me.

39
00:01:50,830 --> 00:01:53,140
Well,here's an
interesting turn of events.

40
00:01:53,150 --> 00:01:54,800
What?

41
00:01:56,050 --> 00:01:57,520
Howard brought a date?

42
00:01:57,530 --> 00:02:02,470
A more plausible explanation is that his work
in robotics has made an amazing leap forward.

43
00:02:03,070 --> 00:02:06,260
Hey,what up,science bitches?

44
00:02:07,370 --> 00:02:10,590
May I introduce my
special lady friend summer?

45
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:12,380
Howard,I told you touching's extra.

46
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:14,510
Right. Sorry.

47
00:02:14,990 --> 00:02:17,750
Here comes our new boss. Be polite.

48
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,130
Hi,fellas.

49
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:21,170
- Eric gablehauser.
- Howard wolowitz.

50
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:24,410
Howard,nice to meet you. And you are?

51
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:28,250
An actual real scientist.

52
00:02:30,410 --> 00:02:32,240
How was that?

53
00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:35,860
I can't believe he fired me.

54
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:38,700
Well,you did call him a glorified
high school science teacher

55
00:02:38,710 --> 00:02:43,080
whose last successful experiment
was lighting his own farts.

56
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:47,130
In my defense,I prefaced that
by saying,"with all due respect."

00:03:13,970 --> 00:03:15,240
Morning.

61
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:16,760
Morning.

62
00:03:16,770 --> 00:03:18,900
You're making eggs for breakfast?

63
00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:21,590
This isn't breakfast,it's an experiment.

64
00:03:23,450 --> 00:03:25,800
'Cause it looks a lot like breakfast.

65
00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:29,580
I finally have time to test my hypothesis
about the separation of the water molecules

66
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:33,550
from the egg proteins and
its impact vis-a-vis taste.

67
00:03:34,670 --> 00:03:36,800
Sounds yummy.

68
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:39,250
I look forward to your work with bacon.

69
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:41,190
As do I.

70
00:03:42,110 --> 00:03:46,500
You know,I'm sure if you just apologize to
gablehauser,he would give you your job back.

71
00:03:46,510 --> 00:03:48,090
I don't want my job back.

72
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:52,080
I've spent the past three and a half years
staring at grease boards full of equations.

73
00:03:52,090 --> 00:03:54,650
Before that,I spent four
years working on my thesis.

74
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:58,770
Before that,I was in college,and
before that,I was in the fifth grade.

75
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:03,640
This is my first d oayff in
decades and I'm going to savor it.

76
00:04:03,650 --> 00:04:05,640
Okay.

77
00:04:05,650 --> 00:04:07,720
I'll let you get back
to fixing your eggs.

78
00:04:07,730 --> 00:04:11,370
Not just fixing my eggs,I'm
fixing everyone's eggs.

79
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:13,940
And we all thank you.

80
00:04:44,590 --> 00:04:47,460
use new eggs.

81
00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:52,120
hi. Hey,I'm running out to the market.

82
00:04:52,130 --> 00:04:53,540
Do you guys need anything?

83
00:04:53,550 --> 00:04:56,080
Oh,well,this would be one
of those circumstances that

84
00:04:56,090 --> 00:04:59,860
people unfamiliar with the law of
large numbers would call a coincidence.

85
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:00,890
I'm sorry?

86
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:01,870
I need eggs.

87
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:03,340
Four dozen should suffice.

88
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:04,100
Four dozen?

89
00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:06,430
Yes,and evenly distributed
amongst brown,white,

90
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:09,720
free-range,large,extra large and jumbo.

91
00:05:09,730 --> 00:05:11,100
Okay,one more time.

92
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:13,430
Never mind. You won't get it right.

93
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:15,590
I'd better come with you.

94
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:18,020
Oh,yay.

95
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:24,000
How come you didn't go into work today?

96
00:05:24,410 --> 00:05:28,880
I'm taking a sabbatical because
I won't kowtow to mediocre minds.

97
00:05:28,890 --> 00:05:31,000
So you got canned,huh?

98
00:05:31,010 --> 00:05:34,510
Theoretical physicists
do not get canned...

99
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:36,390
but yeah.

100
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:38,380
Well,maybe it's all for the best.

101
00:05:38,390 --> 00:05:41,990
You know,I always say when one
door closes,another one opens.

102
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,830
No,it doesn'T.

103
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:48,600
Not unless the two doors are connected by
relays or there are motion sensors involved.

104
00:05:48,610 --> 00:05:49,200
No,no,I meant...

105
00:05:49,210 --> 00:05:53,580
or if the first door closing creates a change
of air pressure that acts upon the second door.

106
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:56,190
Never mind.

107
00:05:56,990 --> 00:05:58,160
Slow down.

108
00:05:58,170 --> 00:06:00,100
Slow down. Please,slow down!

109
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:01,060
We're fine!

110
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:03,710
You're not leaving yourself
enough space between cars.

111
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:04,690
Oh,sure,I am.

112
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:06,530
No,no,let me do the math for you.

113
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:09,030
This car weighs,let's say 4,000 pounds.

114
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:11,430
Now add 140 for me,120 for you...

115
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:13,360
- 120?
- Oh,I'm sorry.

116
00:06:13,370 --> 00:06:14,550
Did I insult you?

117
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:17,610
Is your body mass somehow
tied into your self-worth?

118
00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:19,890
Well,yeah.

119
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:21,150
Interesting.

120
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:24,700
Anyway,that gives us a total
weight of,let's say 4,400 pounds.

121
00:06:24,710 --> 00:06:26,890
Let's say 4,390.

122
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:28,370
Fine.

123
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:32,330
We're traveling forward at--
good lord-- 51 miles an hour.

124
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:35,680
Now let's assume that your brakes
are new and the calipers are aligned.

125
00:06:35,690 --> 00:06:37,420
Still,by the time we come to a stop,

126
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:40,010
we'll be occupying the same space
as that buick in front of us,

127
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:43,950
an impossibility that nature will
quickly resolve into death,mutilation...

128
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:47,240
oh,look,they built a
new putt-putt course.

129
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,860
This is great.

130
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:53,010
Look at me.

131
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:59,020
I'm in the real world of ordinary people just
living their ordinary,colorless workaday lives.

132
00:06:59,490 --> 00:07:00,600
Thank you.

133
00:07:00,610 --> 00:07:02,550
No,thank you.

134
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:05,170
And thank you,ordinary person.

135
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:09,270
Hey,you want to hear an
interesting thing about tomatoes?

136
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:10,650
Uh,no,no,not really.

137
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:13,730
Listen,didn't you say
you needed some eggs?

138
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:17,110
Yes,but anyone who knows anything
about the dynamics of bacterial growth

139
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:20,510
knows to pick up their refrigerated
foods on the way out of the supermarket.

140
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:24,020
Oh,okay,well,then maybe you
should start heading on out then.

141
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:26,530
No,this is fun.

142
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:29,130
Oh,the thing about tomatoes-- and
I think you'll really enjoy this--

143
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:33,030
is they're shelved with the
vegetables,but they're technically a fruit.

144
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:34,580
- Oh,interesting.
- Isn't it?

145
00:07:34,590 --> 00:07:37,420
No,I mean what you find enjoyable.

146
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:43,110
Oh,boy.

147
00:07:44,250 --> 00:07:46,210
What now?

148
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:51,080
Well,there's some value to taking a multivitamin,but
the human body can only absorb so much.

149
00:07:51,090 --> 00:07:55,120
What you're buying here are the
ingredients for very expensive urine.

150
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:59,950
Well,maybe that's what I was going for.

151
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:03,070
Well,then you'll want some manganese.

152
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:10,070
Well,that was fun.

153
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:12,800
Maybe tomorrow we can go to one
of those big warehouse stores.

154
00:08:12,810 --> 00:08:13,960
Oh,I don't know,sheldon.

155
00:08:13,970 --> 00:08:17,790
It's going to take me a while to
recover from all the fun I had today.

156
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:19,710
Are you sure?

157
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:22,200
There are a lot of
advantages to buying in bulk.

158
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:27,330
For example,I noticed that you purchase
your tampons one-month supply at a time.

159
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:30,440
What?

160
00:08:30,450 --> 00:08:31,100
Think about it.

161
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:35,790
It's a product that doesn't spoil and you're going
to be needing them for at least the next 30 years.

162
00:08:36,660 --> 00:08:40,160
You want me to buy 30
years worth of tampons?

163
00:08:40,170 --> 00:08:41,290
Well,30,35.

164
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:44,060
- When did your mother go into menopause?
- Okay.

165
00:08:44,830 --> 00:08:46,830
I'm not talking about this with you.

166
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:51,920
Oh,penny,this is a natural human process,and we're
talking about statistically significant savings.

167
00:08:51,930 --> 00:08:55,970
Now,if you assume 15 tampons
per cycle and a 28-day cycle...

168
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:58,550
are you fairly regular?

169
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:06,620
Okay,no warehouse store,but we're
still on for putt-putt golf,right?

170
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:13,450
Hey,I just ran into penny.

171
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:15,520
She seemed upset about something.

172
00:09:15,530 --> 00:09:17,950
I think it's her time of the month.

173
00:09:19,830 --> 00:09:23,000
I marked the calendar
for future reference.

174
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:28,110
What's with the fish?

175
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:30,120
It's an experiment.

176
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:33,210
What happened to your
scrambled egg research?

177
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:34,560
Oh,that was a dead end.

178
00:09:34,570 --> 00:09:37,710
Scrambled eggs are as good
as they're ever going to be.

179
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:40,880
So... fish?

180
00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:46,670
I read an article about japanese scientists who
inserted dna from luminous jellyfish into other animals,

181
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:51,110
and I thought,"hey,fish nightlights.

182
00:09:53,310 --> 00:09:55,200
" Fish nightlights?

183
00:09:55,210 --> 00:09:56,820
It's a billion-dollar idea.

184
00:09:59,270 --> 00:10:01,100
Mum's the word.

185
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:06,250
Sheldon,are you sure you don't want to just
apologize to gablehauser and get your job back?

186
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:09,390
Oh,no,no,no,I have too much to do.

187
00:10:10,010 --> 00:10:11,400
Like luminous fish.

188
00:10:11,890 --> 00:10:13,760
I'm sorry. I didn'T...

189
00:10:15,550 --> 00:10:17,120
that's just the beginning.

190
00:10:17,130 --> 00:10:21,410
I also have an idea for a bulk
mail-order feminine hygiene company.

191
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:23,910
Oh,glow-in-the-dark
tampons!

192
00:10:26,650 --> 00:10:29,570
Leonard,we're gonna be rich.

193
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:34,890
Thanks for coming on such short notice.

194
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:36,200
Well,you did the right thing calling.

195
00:10:36,210 --> 00:10:37,340
I didn't know what else to do.

196
00:10:37,350 --> 00:10:38,650
He's lost all focus.

197
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:41,100
Every day he's got a new obsession.

198
00:10:47,590 --> 00:10:50,890
This is a particularly disturbing one.

199
00:10:53,050 --> 00:10:54,870
Mommy?

200
00:10:55,090 --> 00:10:57,740
Hi,baby!

201
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:11,320
Oh,you got yourself a loom? How nice!

202
00:11:11,330 --> 00:11:12,460
Thank you.

203
00:11:12,470 --> 00:11:14,880
Honey,why'd you get a loom?

204
00:11:15,690 --> 00:11:19,860
I was working with luminous
fish,and I thought,hey...

205
00:11:20,990 --> 00:11:23,090
"loom."

206
00:11:24,510 --> 00:11:26,890
Mom,what are you doing here?

207
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:28,560
Leonard called me.

208
00:11:28,570 --> 00:11:30,440
I know,but why?

209
00:11:30,450 --> 00:11:34,650
Because one of the great minds of the 21st
century is raising glow-in-the-dark fish

210
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:37,200
and weaving serapes.

211
00:11:37,210 --> 00:11:39,850
This is not a serape,this is a poncho.

212
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:42,060
A serape is open at the
sides; a poncho is closed.

213
00:11:42,070 --> 00:11:42,990
This is a poncho.

214
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,870
And neither is a reason
to call someone's mother.

215
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:50,800
Really? When was the last
time you left the house?

216
00:11:50,810 --> 00:11:52,500
I went to the market with penny.

217
00:11:52,510 --> 00:11:54,380
Yeah,that was three weeks ago.

218
00:11:54,390 --> 00:11:58,920
Well,then buckle up-- in the next four to
eight days she's going to get very crabby.

219
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:04,230
Sweetheart,your little
friend is concerned about you.

220
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:08,940
Yes,well,I'm not a child-- I'm a grown
man,capable of living my life as I see fit.

221
00:12:08,950 --> 00:12:12,870
And I certainly don't need
someone telling on me to my mother!

222
00:12:13,430 --> 00:12:14,830
Wait,where are you going?

223
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:17,720
To my room-- and
no one's allowed in!

224
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:22,350
oh,he gets his temper from his daddy.

225
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:25,070
- He's got my eyes.
- I see.

226
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:28,580
All that science
stuff,that comes from jesus.

227
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:33,430
Sheldon,your mom made dinner.

228
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:35,200
I'm not hungry!

229
00:12:35,430 --> 00:12:37,540
Oh,leonard,don't trouble
yourself. He's stubborn.

230
00:12:37,550 --> 00:12:39,990
He may stay in there till the rapture.

231
00:12:41,350 --> 00:12:43,730
We so sure that's a bad thing?

232
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:46,580
I tell you,I love the boy to
death,but he has been difficult

233
00:12:46,590 --> 00:12:49,150
since he fell out of me at the k-mart.

234
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:57,120
Excuse me for being so bold,but I now see
where sheldon gets his smoldering good looks.

235
00:12:58,540 --> 00:13:01,660
Honey,that ain't gonna
work,but you keep tryin'.

236
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:04,060
I made chicken.

237
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:09,170
I hope that isn't one of the animals
that you people think is magic.

238
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:16,910
You know,we have an indian
gentleman at our church,

239
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:19,460
a dr.Patel-- it's
a beautiful story.

240
00:13:19,470 --> 00:13:24,050
The lord spoke to him and moved him
to give us all 20% off on lasik--

241
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:26,500
you know,those that needed it.

242
00:13:26,510 --> 00:13:28,000
Leonard: That is a lovely story.

243
00:13:28,010 --> 00:13:30,310
Um,are we gonna do
anything about sheldon?

244
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:31,170
Oh,we will.

245
00:13:31,180 --> 00:13:33,270
You have to take your time with sheldon.

246
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:35,410
His father,god rest his
soul,used to always say to me,

247
00:13:35,420 --> 00:13:38,640
"mary,you have to take
your time with sheldon."

248
00:13:39,490 --> 00:13:40,960
Sounds like a wise man.

249
00:13:40,970 --> 00:13:42,530
Oh,not so wise.

250
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:45,840
He once tried to fight a
bobcat for some licorice.

251
00:13:46,490 --> 00:13:51,810
So,everybody grab a plate and a
pretty place mat that shelly wove.

252
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:54,360
Has shelly ever freaked
out like this before?

253
00:13:54,370 --> 00:13:55,950
Oh,all the time.

254
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:58,310
I remember one summer when he was 13,

255
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:01,650
he built a small nuclear
reactor in the shed

256
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:04,870
and told everybody he was gonna provide
free electricity for the whole town.

257
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:09,810
Well,the only problem was,he had no
what you call "fissionable" materials.

258
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:13,230
Anyway,when he went on
the internets to get some,

259
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:17,900
a man from the government came
by and sat him down real gentle,

260
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:22,400
and told him it's against the law to
have yellow-cake uranium in a shed.

261
00:14:23,010 --> 00:14:23,780
Well,what happened?

262
00:14:23,790 --> 00:14:25,320
Well,poor boy had a fit.

263
00:14:25,330 --> 00:14:29,510
Locked himself in his room
and built a sonic death ray.

264
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:30,480
A death ray?

265
00:14:30,490 --> 00:14:31,960
Well,that's what he called it.

266
00:14:31,970 --> 00:14:34,450
Didn't even slow down the neighbor kids.

267
00:14:35,310 --> 00:14:37,830
It pissed our dog off to no end.

268
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:42,570
You know,you two make a cute couple.

269
00:14:43,230 --> 00:14:44,670
uh,no. We're not...

270
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:46,160
we're not-not a couple. We're singles.

271
00:14:46,170 --> 00:14:46,980
- Two singles.
- Yeah.

272
00:14:46,990 --> 00:14:51,050
Like those... individually
wrapped slices of cheese that...

273
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:54,320
we're friends.

274
00:14:55,510 --> 00:14:56,630
Did I pluck a nerve there?

275
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:58,170
- Oh,yeah.
- Okay.

276
00:14:58,180 --> 00:15:00,560
All right,everybody,it's time to eat.

277
00:15:01,450 --> 00:15:06,330
Oh,lord,we thank you for this
meal and all of your bounty.

278
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:10,100
And we pray that you help
sheldon get back on his rocker.

279
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:15,540
Now,after a moment of silent meditation,I'm
gonna end with "in jesus' name,"

280
00:15:15,550 --> 00:15:18,830
but you two don't feel
any obligation to join in.

281
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:22,740
Unless,of course,the
holy spirit moves you.

282
00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:34,800
Oh,my god,this is the
best cobbler I've ever had.

283
00:15:34,810 --> 00:15:36,550
It was always sheldon's favorite.

284
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,930
You know w thathe secret ingredient is?

285
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:41,160
- Love?
- Lard.

286
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:46,790
Hey,look who's come...

287
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:49,170
You'll spook him.

288
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:53,910
He's like a baby deer-- you
got to let him come to you.

289
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:03,530
This is ridiculous.

290
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:05,720
Damn it,sheldon,snap out of it!

291
00:16:05,730 --> 00:16:10,340
You're a physicist-- you belong at the
university doing research,not hiding in your room!

292
00:16:17,070 --> 00:16:19,470
you don't hunt,do you?

293
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:27,360
good morning,snickerdoodle.

294
00:16:28,450 --> 00:16:29,370
Morning.

295
00:16:29,930 --> 00:16:32,690
Oh,well,that looks awful
fancy. What is that?

296
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:38,380
It's my idea of what dna would look
like in a silicon-based life-form.

297
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:43,550
But intelligently designed
by a creator,right?

298
00:16:45,930 --> 00:16:47,480
What do you want,mom?

299
00:16:47,490 --> 00:16:49,810
You know how your daddy used to say that

300
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:54,440
you can only fish for so long before you got
to throw a stick of dynamite in the water?

301
00:16:54,830 --> 00:16:55,540
Yeah.

302
00:16:55,550 --> 00:16:57,980
Well,I'm done fishing.

303
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:00,790
You put those on.

304
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:01,580
What for?

305
00:17:01,590 --> 00:17:03,670
Because you're gonna
go down to your office,

306
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:06,520
you're gonna apologize to your
boss and get your job back.

307
00:17:06,530 --> 00:17:07,380
No.

308
00:17:07,390 --> 00:17:11,920
I'm sorry,did I start that sentence with
the words,"if it please your highness"?

309
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:16,680
I'm not going to apologize-- I
didn't say anything that wasn't true.

310
00:17:16,690 --> 00:17:18,180
Now,you listen here.

311
00:17:18,190 --> 00:17:20,930
I have been telling you
since you were four years old,

312
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:24,920
it's okay to be smarter than everybody,but
you can't go around pointing it out.

313
00:17:24,930 --> 00:17:25,670
Why not?

314
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:28,210
Because people don't like it!

315
00:17:29,030 --> 00:17:32,850
Remember all the ass-kickings
you got from the neighbor kids?

316
00:17:35,010 --> 00:17:36,760
now,let's get crackin'.

317
00:17:36,770 --> 00:17:40,010
Shower,shirt,shoes,and let's shove off.

318
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:46,200
There wouldn't have been any ass-kickings
if that stupid death ray had worked.

319
00:17:51,010 --> 00:17:52,810
Problem solved.

320
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:54,210
Really?

321
00:17:54,220 --> 00:17:55,530
That's impressive.

322
00:17:55,540 --> 00:17:58,960
Leonard,the lord never gives
us more than we can handle.

323
00:17:58,970 --> 00:18:02,890
Thankfully,he blessed me with two
other children who are dumb as soup.

324
00:18:08,510 --> 00:18:10,780
Excuse me,dr.Gablehauser,are you busy?

325
00:18:10,790 --> 00:18:11,400
Well,actually...

326
00:18:11,410 --> 00:18:12,830
sheldon,he's just doodlin'.

327
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:14,300
Get in here.

328
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:18,660
Dr.Gablehauser.

329
00:18:18,670 --> 00:18:20,630
Dr.Cooper.

330
00:18:21,370 --> 00:18:23,920
Let's go,baby--
we're losing daylight.

331
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:32,460
as you know,several weeks
ago in our first encounter,

332
00:18:32,470 --> 00:18:36,920
we may have gotten off on the wrong
foot when I called you an idiot.

333
00:18:37,470 --> 00:18:40,270
And I just wanted to
say that I was wrong...

334
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:42,820
to point it out.

335
00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:47,330
I'm sorry,we haven't been introduced.

336
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:48,530
Dr.Eric gablehauser.

337
00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:50,510
Mary cooper,sheldon's mom.

338
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:52,000
Now,that's
impossible--

339
00:18:52,010 --> 00:18:54,030
you must have had him
when you were a teenager.

340
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:55,280
Oh,aren't you sweet.

341
00:18:55,290 --> 00:18:57,540
His father's dead.

342
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:01,330
- Recently?
- Long enough.

343
00:19:02,060 --> 00:19:03,370
Please.

344
00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:06,790
sheldon,shouldn't you be working?

345
00:19:10,850 --> 00:19:12,750
Okay.

346
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,940
Hey,how did it go?

347
00:19:18,950 --> 00:19:20,480
I got my job back.

348
00:19:20,490 --> 00:19:22,560
Really? What happened?

349
00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:24,850
I'm not quite sure.

350
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:29,510
It involves a part of the human
experience that has always eluded me.

351
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:32,740
Well,that narrows it down.

352
00:19:35,910 --> 00:19:37,670
I'm very proud of you,honey.

353
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:40,430
You showed a lot of courage today.

354
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:42,030
Thanks,mom.

355
00:19:45,740 --> 00:19:46,880
Mom?

356
00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:51,490
Is dr.Gablehauser going
to be my new daddy?

357
00:19:54,130 --> 00:19:55,830
We'll see.

358
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:56,930
Sleep tight.
