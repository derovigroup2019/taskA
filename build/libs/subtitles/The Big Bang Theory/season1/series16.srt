1
00:00:01,300 --> 00:00:02,680
- I got him!
- Take him down!

2
00:00:02,690 --> 00:00:04,490
- He's got you, sheldon.
- Look at this move!

3
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:06,210
He's completely schooling you.

4
00:00:06,220 --> 00:00:09,680
Hey, guys, guys, some of the other
waitresses wanted me to ask
you something.

5
00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:10,930
It's called tressling.

6
00:00:10,940 --> 00:00:14,660
It combines the physical strength of arm
wrestling with the mental agility
of tetris

7
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:16,810
into the ultimate sport.

8
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:20,480
Yeah, that's terrific, but what they
wanted me to ask you is to cut it the
hell out.

9
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:22,980
Great. Come here, guys.
Come on.

10
00:00:22,995 --> 00:00:26,730
Happy birthday to you

11
00:00:26,741 --> 00:00:28,852
we might as well stop.
It's a stalemate.

12
00:00:28,861 --> 00:00:33,064
You're beating me in tetris, but you've
got the upper body strength of a
keebler elf.

13
00:00:33,072 --> 00:00:36,273
Keebler elf?
I've got your keebler elf right here.

14
00:00:40,619 --> 00:00:42,843
Okay, it's a stalemate.

15
00:00:44,145 --> 00:00:48,032
So, leonard, will we be seeing you on
saturday for your free
birthday cheesecake?

16
00:00:48,046 --> 00:00:50,643
He can't eat cheesecake.
He's lactose intolerant.

17
00:00:50,657 --> 00:00:51,902
Okay, he can have carrot cake.

18
00:00:51,917 --> 00:00:53,191
What about the cream
cheese frosting?

19
00:00:53,225 --> 00:00:55,860
He can scrape it off.

20
00:00:56,247 --> 00:00:59,243
Forget about the cake. How do you
know that my birthday's saturday?

21
00:00:59,258 --> 00:01:00,562
I did your horoscope, remember?

22
00:01:00,576 --> 00:01:05,223
I was going to do everybody's, until
sheldon went on one of his typical
psychotic rants.

23
00:01:05,238 --> 00:01:07,252
For the record,
"that psychotic rant"

24
00:01:07,266 --> 00:01:10,343
was a concise summation of
the research of bertram forer,

25
00:01:10,356 --> 00:01:14,490
who, in 1948, proved conclusively
through meticulously
designed experiments

26
00:01:14,506 --> 00:01:17,232
that astrology is nothing
but pseudo-scientific hokum.

27
00:01:17,247 --> 00:01:19,882
Blah, blah, blah.
Typical taurus.

28
00:01:20,528 --> 00:01:22,162
So, seriously,
are we going to see you saturday?

29
00:01:22,197 --> 00:01:23,311
Uh, I don't think so.

30
00:01:23,328 --> 00:01:24,053
Why not?

31
00:01:24,077 --> 00:01:25,392
I don't celebrate my birthday.

32
00:01:25,406 --> 00:01:26,913
Shut up. Yeah, you do.

33
00:01:26,928 --> 00:01:29,322
It's no big deal;
it's just the way I was raised.

34
00:01:29,337 --> 00:01:31,670
My parents focused on
celebrating achievements,

35
00:01:31,685 --> 00:01:35,502
and being expelled from a birth
canal was not considered one of them.

36
00:01:36,255 --> 00:01:37,511
That's so silly.

37
00:01:37,526 --> 00:01:39,602
Sheldon: It's actually based
on very sound theories.

38
00:01:39,618 --> 00:01:41,473
His mother published
a paper on it.

39
00:01:41,488 --> 00:01:42,432
Well, what was it called?

40
00:01:42,467 --> 00:01:45,770
"I hate my son and that's
why he can't have cake"?

41
00:01:46,187 --> 00:01:47,531
Sheldon: It was
obviously effective.

42
00:01:47,567 --> 00:01:49,933
Leonard grew up to be an
experimental physicist.

43
00:01:49,946 --> 00:01:53,583
Perhaps if she'd also denied him
christmas, he'd be a little better
at it.

44
00:01:54,647 --> 00:01:56,433
Thank you.

45
00:01:56,448 --> 00:01:57,951
Well, I love birthdays.

46
00:01:57,968 --> 00:02:00,752
Waking up to mom's special
french toast breakfast,

47
00:02:00,766 --> 00:02:04,562
wearing the birthday king crown,
playing laser tag with all my friends...

48
00:02:04,576 --> 00:02:06,662
Yeah, see?
That's what kids should have.

49
00:02:06,675 --> 00:02:09,190
Actually, that was last year.

50
00:02:12,177 --> 00:02:15,641
So you really never
had a birthday party?

51
00:02:15,656 --> 00:02:17,392
No, but it was okay.

52
00:02:17,417 --> 00:02:18,361
I mean, when I was little,

53
00:02:18,397 --> 00:02:21,393
I'd think maybe my parents would change
their mind and surprise me with a party.

54
00:02:21,425 --> 00:02:24,271
Like this one birthday I came
home from my cello lesson

55
00:02:24,287 --> 00:02:26,683
and I saw a lot of strange
cars parked out front.

56
00:02:26,708 --> 00:02:28,541
When I got to the door,
I could hear people whispering

57
00:02:28,575 --> 00:02:32,761
and I could smell german chocolate cake,
which is my favorite.

58
00:02:33,136 --> 00:02:34,370
And?

59
00:02:34,397 --> 00:02:37,010
It turns out my
grandfather had died.

60
00:02:37,667 --> 00:02:39,923
Oh, my god. That's terrible.

61
00:02:39,935 --> 00:02:43,112
Well, it was kind of
like a birthday party.

62
00:02:43,126 --> 00:02:46,763
I got to see all my cousins,
and there was cake, so...

63
00:02:47,327 --> 00:02:49,530
That's the saddest
thing I've ever heard.

64
00:02:49,557 --> 00:02:50,471
You think?

65
00:02:50,487 --> 00:02:53,460
Go ahead,
tell her about your senior prom.

69
00:03:18,157 --> 00:03:20,213
********Remember-- no peanuts.

70
00:03:20,236 --> 00:03:23,722
Howard, every thai restaurant in
town knows you can't eat peanuts.

71
00:03:24,878 --> 00:03:27,960
When they see me coming,
they go, "ah, no-peanut boy! "

72
00:03:39,246 --> 00:03:41,212
Hello, penny.
Leonard just left.

73
00:03:41,227 --> 00:03:43,080
I know. I want to talk to you.

74
00:03:43,095 --> 00:03:45,173
What would we talk about?

75
00:03:45,185 --> 00:03:47,223
We have no overlapping areas
of interest I'm aware of.

76
00:03:47,258 --> 00:03:49,132
As you know,
I don't care for chitchat.

77
00:03:49,757 --> 00:03:50,750
Can you just let me in?

78
00:03:50,767 --> 00:03:53,840
Well, all right, but I don't see
this as a promising endeavor.

79
00:03:55,397 --> 00:03:56,342
Okay, here's the deal.

80
00:03:56,355 --> 00:03:59,502
We are going to throw leonard a kick-ass
surprise party for his birthday
on saturday.

81
00:03:59,536 --> 00:04:00,812
I hardly think so.

82
00:04:00,828 --> 00:04:02,970
Leonard made it very clear
he doesn't want a party.

83
00:04:02,985 --> 00:04:05,543
Did someone say... "party"?

84
00:04:06,916 --> 00:04:10,132
He just doesn't know he wants
one 'cause he's never had one.

85
00:04:10,148 --> 00:04:11,900
I suppose that's possible,
but for the record,

86
00:04:11,935 --> 00:04:14,933
I've never had a threesome and
yet I still know I want one.

87
00:04:17,608 --> 00:04:18,730
Howard, here's the difference--

88
00:04:18,766 --> 00:04:23,713
the possibility exists that leonard
could have a birthday party before hell
freezes over.

89
00:04:25,527 --> 00:04:28,872
Fine. If I do have a threesome,
you can't be part of it.

90
00:04:30,038 --> 00:04:32,402
I'm just kidding. Yes, you can.

91
00:04:33,115 --> 00:04:34,851
Can you bring a friend?

92
00:04:36,776 --> 00:04:39,252
I think a birthday
party's a terrible idea.

93
00:04:39,268 --> 00:04:42,142
I envy leonard for growing
up without that anguish.

94
00:04:42,155 --> 00:04:42,923
Anguish?

95
00:04:42,935 --> 00:04:46,580
Year after year,
I had to endure wearing comical hats

96
00:04:46,597 --> 00:04:50,162
while being forced into the crowded,
sweaty hell of bouncy castles.

97
00:04:50,177 --> 00:04:54,112
Not to mention being blindfolded and
being spun toward a grotesque
tailless donkey

98
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:57,603
as the other children
mocked my disorientation.

99
00:04:58,265 --> 00:05:02,880
Okay, sweetie, I understand you have
scars that no nonprofessional can heal,

100
00:05:02,898 --> 00:05:05,213
but, nevertheless, we're going to
throw leonard a birthday party.

101
00:05:05,245 --> 00:05:07,902
Have I pointed out that I'm
extremely uncomfortable with dancing,

102
00:05:07,928 --> 00:05:11,383
loud music and most other forms
of alcohol-induced frivolity?

103
00:05:12,817 --> 00:05:13,603
Nevertheless, we're...

104
00:05:13,638 --> 00:05:15,562
- in addition, I really don't think that leonard wants...
- okay, here's the deal:

105
00:05:15,596 --> 00:05:18,043
You either you help me throw leonard
a birthday party or, so help me god,

106
00:05:18,076 --> 00:05:21,792
I will go in youour droom and unbag all
of your most valuable, mint-condition
comic books.

107
00:05:21,808 --> 00:05:26,120
And on one of them-- t u won'yoknow
which-- I'll draw a tiny happy face
in ink.

108
00:05:28,228 --> 00:05:32,070
You can't do that. If you make a mark in
a mint comic book, it's no longer mint.

109
00:05:32,397 --> 00:05:34,741
Sheldon, do you understand
the concept of blackmail?

110
00:05:34,755 --> 00:05:37,131
Well, of course, I... oh.

111
00:05:38,957 --> 00:05:39,890
Yeah, I have an idea.

112
00:05:39,907 --> 00:05:43,243
Let's throw leonard a
kick-ass birthday party.

113
00:06:01,978 --> 00:06:04,410
That's not the secret knock.

114
00:06:05,128 --> 00:06:07,001
This is the secret knock.

115
00:06:10,905 --> 00:06:12,223
What difference does it make?

116
00:06:12,238 --> 00:06:15,443
The whole point of a secret knock
is to establish a non-verbal signal

117
00:06:15,468 --> 00:06:18,681
to verify the identity of
one's co-conspirators.

118
00:06:18,698 --> 00:06:19,680
Penny: Is that raj and howard?

119
00:06:19,718 --> 00:06:22,243
Possibly, but unverified.

120
00:06:22,258 --> 00:06:23,752
Will you just let us in.

121
00:06:23,787 --> 00:06:26,811
Luckily for you,
this is not a nuclear reactor.

122
00:06:27,198 --> 00:06:28,772
So what'd you get
the birthday boy?

123
00:06:28,806 --> 00:06:31,903
Well, raj got him an awesome,
limited edition dark knight sculpture

124
00:06:31,918 --> 00:06:33,901
based on alex ross's
definitive batman.

125
00:06:33,917 --> 00:06:38,202
And I got him this amazing autographed
copy of the feynman lectures on physics.

126
00:06:38,215 --> 00:06:41,362
Nice. I got him a sweater.

127
00:06:42,075 --> 00:06:45,860
Okay, well, he might like that.
I've seen him get chilly.

128
00:06:46,745 --> 00:06:48,341
Sheldon, I didn't
see your present.

129
00:06:48,358 --> 00:06:50,003
That's because I
didn't bring one.

130
00:06:50,026 --> 00:06:51,360
- Why not?
- Don't ask.

131
00:06:51,377 --> 00:06:54,541
The entire institution of
gift-giving makes no sense.

132
00:06:54,565 --> 00:06:55,090
Too late.

133
00:06:55,105 --> 00:06:58,030
Let's say I go out and
I spend $50 on you.

134
00:06:58,055 --> 00:07:01,423
It's a laborious activity because
I have to imagine what you need,

135
00:07:01,445 --> 00:07:02,853
whereas you know what you need.

136
00:07:02,887 --> 00:07:06,111
Now, I could simplify things--
just give you the $50 directly,

137
00:07:06,165 --> 00:07:08,671
and then you could give
me $50 on my birthday,

138
00:07:08,696 --> 00:07:13,323
and so on, until one of us dies, leaving
the other one old and $50 richer.

139
00:07:15,268 --> 00:07:18,013
And I ask you, is it worth it?

140
00:07:18,425 --> 00:07:20,480
Told you not to ask.

141
00:07:20,496 --> 00:07:22,341
Well, sheldon,
you're his friend.

142
00:07:22,357 --> 00:07:24,453
Friends give each
other presents.

143
00:07:24,468 --> 00:07:27,730
I accept your premise;
I reject your conclusion.

144
00:07:28,751 --> 00:07:32,712
Try telling him it's a
non-optional social convention.

145
00:07:32,741 --> 00:07:34,914
- What?
- Just do it.

146
00:07:36,922 --> 00:07:41,453
It's a non-optional...
social convention.

147
00:07:41,469 --> 00:07:43,672
Fair enough.

148
00:07:46,807 --> 00:07:49,362
He came with a manual.

149
00:07:49,835 --> 00:07:52,732
Question-- how am I going to get
leonard a present before the party?

150
00:07:52,757 --> 00:07:55,530
I don't drive and the only things
available within walking distaenc

151
00:07:55,546 --> 00:07:57,621
are a thai restaurant
and a gas station.

152
00:07:57,638 --> 00:08:02,080
I suppose I could wrap up an order of
mee krob and a coup e of
ttery scratchers.

153
00:08:02,096 --> 00:08:05,923
Okay let's do this--
I will drive sheldon to get a present.

154
00:08:05,948 --> 00:08:07,982
And howard, you need to get rid
of leonard for about two hours.

155
00:08:08,016 --> 00:08:08,572
No problem.

156
00:08:08,585 --> 00:08:12,051
And then, raj, you bring the stuff
across the hall and start setting up.

157
00:08:13,135 --> 00:08:15,010
What if guests show up?

158
00:08:15,027 --> 00:08:16,722
Entertain them.

159
00:08:16,907 --> 00:08:19,120
What if they're women?

160
00:08:19,868 --> 00:08:22,820
Stare at them and make
them feel uncomfortable.

161
00:08:35,435 --> 00:08:37,450
- How's it goin'?
- Fine.

162
00:08:38,227 --> 00:08:43,831
So listen, the nuart is showing the
revised, definitive cut of blade runner.

163
00:08:43,846 --> 00:08:44,641
Seen it.

164
00:08:44,658 --> 00:08:48,451
No, you've seen the 25th
anniversary final cut.

165
00:08:48,465 --> 00:08:51,532
This one has eight seconds of
previously unseen footage.

166
00:08:51,548 --> 00:08:54,461
They say it completely
changes the tone of the film.

167
00:08:55,138 --> 00:08:56,602
Pass.

168
00:08:56,615 --> 00:09:01,023
Come on. Afterwards, there's a q &
a with harrison ford's body double.

169
00:09:01,438 --> 00:09:04,060
Look, I'm in the halo
bale of my life here.

170
00:09:04,085 --> 00:09:06,523
There's this kid in copenhagen--
he has no immune system,

171
00:09:06,538 --> 00:09:10,513
so all he does is sit in his
bubble and play halo 24-seven.

172
00:09:10,528 --> 00:09:12,302
Can't you play him
some other time?

173
00:09:12,315 --> 00:09:15,053
Not if you believe his doctors.

174
00:09:18,328 --> 00:09:20,850
Oh, my god, do you smell gas?

175
00:09:21,696 --> 00:09:23,772
- No.
- Yeah, no.

176
00:09:28,457 --> 00:09:30,022
You know,
they have dvds over there.

177
00:09:30,038 --> 00:09:34,043
Yes, but they have
rndvd buers over here.

178
00:09:34,057 --> 00:09:36,641
Leonard needs a dvd burner.

179
00:09:37,075 --> 00:09:40,903
Sheldon, a gift shouldn't be something
someone needs, it should be
something fun.

180
00:09:40,917 --> 00:09:43,111
You know, something they
wouldn't buy for themself.

181
00:09:43,125 --> 00:09:46,033
You mean like a sweater?

182
00:09:47,767 --> 00:09:49,621
It's a fun sweater.

183
00:09:49,636 --> 00:09:52,153
It's got a bold
geometric print.

184
00:09:52,168 --> 00:09:55,130
- Is it the geometry that makes it fun?
- Okay...

185
00:09:55,626 --> 00:09:58,173
The point is one of the ways
we show we care about people

186
00:09:58,188 --> 00:10:01,920
is by putting thought and imagination
into the gifts we give them.

187
00:10:01,937 --> 00:10:05,560
Okay, I see.
So, not a dvd burner.

188
00:10:05,578 --> 00:10:06,483
Exactly.

189
00:10:06,496 --> 00:10:09,300
Something he wouldn't buy for himself.
Something fun.

190
00:10:09,318 --> 00:10:13,223
Something like...
an 802-11n wireless router!

191
00:10:17,065 --> 00:10:18,941
Here you go, copenhagen boy.

192
00:10:18,955 --> 00:10:22,361
How about a taste of hans
christian hand grenade?

193
00:10:23,758 --> 00:10:27,211
Oh, that could not feel good.

194
00:10:29,796 --> 00:10:32,343
Come on, come...
oh, you clever...

195
00:10:36,538 --> 00:10:40,380
Come on. Come on. Take that!

196
00:10:47,327 --> 00:10:49,540
- What's the matter?
- This granola bar, it has peanuts in it!

197
00:10:49,576 --> 00:10:51,460
Oh, my god. Why did you eat it?

198
00:10:51,478 --> 00:10:52,963
I don't know.
It was just there!

199
00:10:52,976 --> 00:10:56,953
If I had a gun there,
would you have shot yourself?

200
00:10:56,967 --> 00:10:59,850
Don't yell at me!
I've got to go to the emergency room!

201
00:10:59,865 --> 00:11:00,513
Now?

202
00:11:00,525 --> 00:11:04,530
No, after my tongue has swollen
to the size of a brisket!

203
00:11:04,547 --> 00:11:07,271
All right, uh,
just let me get my keys.

204
00:11:07,295 --> 00:11:10,753
Oh, god, oh, god, oh, god!

205
00:11:10,767 --> 00:11:13,942
The laundry is
out of the hamper.

206
00:11:16,487 --> 00:11:19,342
Okay, sheldon,
what was it supposed to be?

207
00:11:20,035 --> 00:11:22,891
Fine. It's out of the washer!

208
00:11:22,906 --> 00:11:25,552
I'll call you when
it's in the dryer.

209
00:11:25,915 --> 00:11:27,982
All right, let's go.

210
00:11:37,625 --> 00:11:39,030
What do you think?

211
00:11:39,045 --> 00:11:40,011
Um, that one.

212
00:11:40,027 --> 00:11:42,641
- Because of the two additional ethernet ports?
- Sure.

213
00:11:42,656 --> 00:11:45,613
He doesn't need them. He's already
got a six-port ethernet switch.

214
00:11:45,628 --> 00:11:47,610
- Oh, okay, then this one.
- Why?

215
00:11:47,627 --> 00:11:50,600
I don't know.
The man on the box looks so happy.

216
00:11:51,155 --> 00:11:54,663
Penny, if I'm going to buy leonard
a gift, I'm going to do it right.

217
00:11:54,675 --> 00:11:58,331
I refuse to let him experience
the same childhood trauma I did.

218
00:11:58,408 --> 00:12:02,041
I know I'm gonna regret this, but:
What trauma?

219
00:12:02,676 --> 00:12:06,932
On my 12th birthday, I really
wanted a titanium centrifuge so,

220
00:12:06,947 --> 00:12:09,620
you know,
I could separate radioactive isotopes.

221
00:12:09,635 --> 00:12:10,712
Of course.

222
00:12:10,748 --> 00:12:14,890
Instead of a titanium centrifuge,
my parents bought me...

223
00:12:14,915 --> 00:12:17,330
Wow, this is hard.

224
00:12:17,348 --> 00:12:21,171
They got me a
motorized dirt bike.

225
00:12:22,976 --> 00:12:24,571
No!

226
00:12:24,588 --> 00:12:28,150
What 12-year-old boy wants
a motorized dirt bike?

227
00:12:28,917 --> 00:12:30,502
All of them?

228
00:12:30,516 --> 00:12:32,991
- Really?
- Yeah.

229
00:12:35,506 --> 00:12:36,702
Okay, so we're
getting this one?

230
00:12:36,735 --> 00:12:39,081
- Yeah, I suppose.
- All right, let's go.

231
00:12:39,535 --> 00:12:40,732
Exexse me.

232
00:12:40,746 --> 00:12:42,532
Do you know anything
about this stuff?

233
00:12:42,545 --> 00:12:44,723
I know everything
about this stuff.

234
00:12:44,738 --> 00:12:47,490
Woman: Okay,
I have my own wholesale flower business

235
00:12:47,518 --> 00:12:51,570
and I want to hook up my computer in the
front entrance with the one in my
refrigerated warehouse.

236
00:12:51,586 --> 00:12:54,412
Here, buy this one: Look, it's the
one we're getting. See? Happy guy.

237
00:12:54,425 --> 00:12:55,722
No, no, no,
she doesn't want that.

238
00:12:55,757 --> 00:13:00,401
She needs a point-to-point peer
network with a range extender.

239
00:13:00,417 --> 00:13:01,213
Thank you.

240
00:13:01,228 --> 00:13:05,071
Which hard drive do I want--
firewire or usb?

241
00:13:05,095 --> 00:13:08,500
It depends on what buss
you have available.

242
00:13:10,998 --> 00:13:14,290
I drive a chevy cavalier.

243
00:13:14,987 --> 00:13:16,482
Oh, dear lord.

244
00:13:16,497 --> 00:13:19,271
- Sheldon, we have to go.
- Not now, penny. This poor man needs me.

245
00:13:19,287 --> 00:13:21,583
You, hold on.
I'll be right with you.

246
00:13:21,598 --> 00:13:23,320
What computer do you have?

247
00:13:23,336 --> 00:13:25,591
And please don't
say "a white one. "

248
00:13:31,175 --> 00:13:32,281
Excuse me.

249
00:13:32,296 --> 00:13:33,550
Fill this out. Have a seat.

250
00:13:33,568 --> 00:13:35,961
No, listen. See, we're throwing
my friend a surprise party

251
00:13:35,977 --> 00:13:38,851
and I'm supposed to keep him out
of his apartment for two hours.

252
00:13:38,866 --> 00:13:40,703
Fill this out and have a seat.

253
00:13:40,718 --> 00:13:43,631
No, see, the only way I could gehit m
to leave was to tell him I ate a peanut

254
00:13:43,666 --> 00:13:45,832
because I'm allergic
to peanuts.

255
00:13:45,846 --> 00:13:49,122
Well, in that case,
fill this out and have a seat.

256
00:13:49,788 --> 00:13:52,190
Look, all I need from you is to take
me in the back and give me a band-aid

257
00:13:52,225 --> 00:13:54,051
so I can pretend I had
a shot of epinephrine,

258
00:13:54,067 --> 00:13:57,243
and then you tell my friend you need to
keep me under observation for about an
hour, hour and a half.

259
00:13:57,276 --> 00:13:58,500
- Is that all you need?
- Yes.

260
00:13:58,516 --> 00:14:01,100
Get out of my er.

261
00:14:01,118 --> 00:14:02,191
No, you don't understand.

262
00:14:02,207 --> 00:14:06,860
Oh, I understand, but unfortunately,
this hospital is not equipped to
treat stupid.

263
00:14:08,368 --> 00:14:11,002
Okay, I get it.
I know how the world works.

264
00:14:11,016 --> 00:14:16,273
How about if I were to introduce to
you to the man who freed your people?

265
00:14:20,827 --> 00:14:24,531
Unless my people were freed by benjamin
franklin and his five twin brothers,

266
00:14:24,546 --> 00:14:26,941
you are wasting your time.

267
00:14:28,328 --> 00:14:31,103
Hey, sorry, I couldn't find a
parking spot. How are you doing?

268
00:14:31,118 --> 00:14:32,810
Bad, very bad.

269
00:14:32,826 --> 00:14:35,093
Really? You don't look like
you're swelling up at all.

270
00:14:35,108 --> 00:14:37,772
Maybe we should just pick up some
benadryl at the drugstore and go home.

271
00:14:37,808 --> 00:14:40,310
- We can't go home.
- Why not?

272
00:14:40,328 --> 00:14:42,192
Because...

273
00:14:42,208 --> 00:14:44,123
Because...

274
00:14:44,468 --> 00:14:47,332
Brisket! Brisket!

275
00:14:47,346 --> 00:14:48,780
Water! Need water!

276
00:14:48,798 --> 00:14:50,982
I'll be right back.

277
00:14:54,926 --> 00:14:56,531
Penny, listen,
I've got a problem.

278
00:14:56,546 --> 00:14:59,282
Yeah, well, so do I. Look,
you gotta stall leonard a little longer.

279
00:14:59,295 --> 00:15:00,390
I don't think I can.

280
00:15:00,406 --> 00:15:03,201
You have to. We all have to be there
at the same time to yell surprise.

281
00:15:03,205 --> 00:15:04,852
Okay, you have to
understand something.

282
00:15:04,868 --> 00:15:06,491
We're in a hospital right now.

283
00:15:06,517 --> 00:15:07,763
Why? Is leonard okay?

284
00:15:07,776 --> 00:15:09,620
Leonard's fine. I'm fine.

285
00:15:09,635 --> 00:15:11,890
Thanks for asking, by the way.

286
00:15:11,917 --> 00:15:13,030
Okay, I don't need
your attitude.

287
00:15:13,066 --> 00:15:15,170
Listen, just hold him
there a little longer.

288
00:15:15,185 --> 00:15:18,980
Look, I've done my best, but he wants to
go home and I don't know how to
stop him.

289
00:15:18,995 --> 00:15:20,332
Okay, how about this?

290
00:15:20,348 --> 00:15:22,311
You keep himhere a little longer,
and when you get to the party,

291
00:15:22,345 --> 00:15:25,611
I'll point out which of
my friends are easy?

292
00:15:34,346 --> 00:15:36,843
Don't toy with me, woman.

293
00:15:38,145 --> 00:15:40,131
I got a hot former fat
girl with no self-esteem,

294
00:15:40,145 --> 00:15:42,062
I got a girl who punishes
her father by sleeping around

295
00:15:42,095 --> 00:15:46,331
and alcoholic who's two tequila shots
away from letting you wear her like
a hat.

296
00:15:48,346 --> 00:15:50,831
Thy will be done.

297
00:16:00,257 --> 00:16:02,671
I'm doing this for you,
little buddy.

298
00:16:08,707 --> 00:16:11,581
Okay, we don't have
that in stock...

299
00:16:12,398 --> 00:16:15,422
But I can special-order
it for you.

300
00:16:15,437 --> 00:16:17,190
Him.

301
00:16:17,207 --> 00:16:20,272
Excuse me, sir.
You don't work here.

302
00:16:20,686 --> 00:16:23,413
Yes, well, apparently,
neither does anyone else.

303
00:16:24,367 --> 00:16:26,413
- Eldon, we have to go.
- Why?

304
00:16:26,425 --> 00:16:28,771
Well, for one thing,
we're late for leonard's birthday party,

305
00:16:28,805 --> 00:16:32,190
and for another,
I told him to call security.

306
00:16:32,677 --> 00:16:34,740
Good luck.

307
00:16:36,177 --> 00:16:38,892
By the way, a six-year-old
could hack your computer system.

308
00:16:38,906 --> 00:16:39,970
Keep walking.

309
00:16:39,988 --> 00:16:42,941
"1234" is not a
secure password.

310
00:16:45,366 --> 00:16:48,252
Excuse me-- my friend is having
an allergic reaction to peanuts.

311
00:16:48,265 --> 00:16:50,381
- No, he's not.
- Yes, he is.

312
00:16:50,396 --> 00:16:53,050
Look, sir,
we are very busy here, and I...

313
00:16:53,067 --> 00:16:56,020
Holy crap!

314
00:16:56,406 --> 00:16:58,743
Please help me!

315
00:16:59,088 --> 00:17:01,821
Code four! I need a gurney!

316
00:17:01,838 --> 00:17:04,213
- Right away! Right away!
- Thank you.

317
00:17:08,408 --> 00:17:10,681
Say what you will about the
healthcare system in this country,

318
00:17:10,715 --> 00:17:14,573
but when they're afraid
of lawsuits, *********

319
00:17:15,007 --> 00:17:18,660
I really don't think the
colonoscopy was necessary.

320
00:17:20,795 --> 00:17:22,241
You know,
before you got all swollen up,

321
00:17:22,276 --> 00:17:24,720
I actually thought you were trying
to keep me out of the apartment

322
00:17:24,756 --> 00:17:27,442
so you could throw
me a surprise party.

323
00:17:27,458 --> 00:17:29,361
Oh, right, it's your birthday.

324
00:17:29,377 --> 00:17:31,532
I had no idea it was your birthday.
I completely forgot.

325
00:17:31,567 --> 00:17:35,211
Wow, what a lousy way to spend a
birthday. Well, it's all over now.

326
00:17:38,778 --> 00:17:41,393
There is a party, isn't there?

327
00:17:41,406 --> 00:17:43,162
Maybe.

328
00:17:43,206 --> 00:17:45,591
Howard?

329
00:17:45,608 --> 00:17:46,833
Are you mad?

330
00:17:46,855 --> 00:17:49,021
How could I be mad?

331
00:17:49,037 --> 00:17:53,861
You actually risked your life
because you care about me.

332
00:17:53,876 --> 00:17:56,460
Yeah, that's why I did it.

333
00:17:58,867 --> 00:18:02,410
All right. Here we go.

334
00:18:02,747 --> 00:18:05,662

335
00:18:05,677 --> 00:18:09,340
* I see your true colors *

336
00:18:09,358 --> 00:18:12,520

337
00:18:14,728 --> 00:18:18,970

338
00:18:20,798 --> 00:18:23,222

339
00:18:26,427 --> 00:18:29,691

340
00:18:29,717 --> 00:18:33,803
I don't know where you are,
dude, but it's really kick-ass!

341
00:18:33,816 --> 00:18:36,750
Everyone is very,
very drunk and...

342
00:18:38,878 --> 00:18:42,220
Oh, and look,
there's a girl taking her shirt off!

343
00:18:43,447 --> 00:18:45,352
That's my friend carol.

344
00:18:45,366 --> 00:18:48,091

347
00:18:56,648 --> 00:18:59,403
Oh, it's okay.
