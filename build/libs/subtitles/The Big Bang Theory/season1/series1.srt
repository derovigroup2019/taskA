1
00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:03,780
so ***** with two slits in it
and either slit is observed,

2
00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:06,290
it will not go through both slits.

3
00:00:06,290 --> 00:00:07,550
If it's unobserved, it will.

4
00:00:07,550 --> 00:00:10,980
However,if it's observed after it's left
the plane but before it hits its target,

5
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:12,780
it will not have gone though both slits.

6
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:15,030
Agreed. What's your point?

7
00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:17,510
There's no point. I just think
it's a good idea for a t-shirt.

8
00:00:23,740 --> 00:00:24,770
Excuse me.

9
00:00:24,770 --> 00:00:26,550
Hang on.

10
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:31,440
Uh,one across is "aegean. "

11
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:35,590
Eight down is "nabokov. "
26 across is "mcm. "

12
00:00:35,590 --> 00:00:38,780
14 down is... move your finger...

13
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:41,830
"phylum" which makes 14
across "port-au-prince"

14
00:00:43,030 --> 00:00:46,700
see,"papa doc's capitol
idea," that's "port-au-prince. "

15
00:00:47,780 --> 00:00:49,690
Haiti.

16
00:00:50,290 --> 00:00:52,110
- Can I help you?
- Yes.

17
00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:58,240
Um... is this the high-iq sperm bank?

18
00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:02,400
If you have to ask, maybe
you shouldn't be here.

19
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:05,080
I think this is the place.

20
00:01:06,220 --> 00:01:08,090
- Fill these out.
- Thank you.

21
00:01:08,090 --> 00:01:09,250
We'll be right back.

22
00:01:09,250 --> 00:01:12,550
Oh,take your time. I'll just
finish my crossword puzzle.

23
00:01:13,670 --> 00:01:16,170
Oh,wait.

24
00:01:26,190 --> 00:01:27,870
Leonard,I don't think I can do this.

25
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:30,280
What,are you kidding?
You're a semi-pro.

26
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:34,280
No. We are committing genetic fraud.

27
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:38,590
There's no guarantee that our sperm is going
to generate high-iq offspring. Think about that.

28
00:01:38,590 --> 00:01:42,260
I have a sister with the same basic
dna mix who hostesses at fuddruckers.

29
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:45,550
Sheldon,this was your idea.

30
00:01:45,550 --> 00:01:48,810
A little extra money to get fractional
t-1 bandwith in the apartment.

31
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:51,930
I know, and I do yearn
for faster downloads.

32
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:56,050
But there's some poor woman who's
gonna pin her hopes on my sperm.

33
00:01:56,050 --> 00:01:59,670
What if she winds up with a toddler who doesn't
know if he should use an integral or a differential

34
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:02,210
to solve the area under a curve?

35
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:04,770
I'm sure she'll still love him.

36
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:06,360
I wouldn'T.

37
00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:09,440
Well,what do you want to do?

38
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:11,580
- I want to leave.
- Okay.

39
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:13,960
What's the protocol for leaving?

40
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:17,180
I don't know- I've never reneged
on a proffer of sperm before.

41
00:02:18,610 --> 00:02:20,550
Let's try just walking out.

42
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:22,750
Okay.

43
00:02:32,390 --> 00:02:34,680
- Bye.
- Bye. Nice meeting you.

44
00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:39,190
Are you still made about the sperm bank?

45
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:40,730
No.

46
00:02:41,770 --> 00:02:44,230
You want to hear an
interesting thing about stairs?

47
00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:46,710
Not really.

48
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:50,750
If the height of a single step

49
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:52,840
I don't care.

50
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:55,950
Two milli... that doesn't seem right.

51
00:02:55,950 --> 00:02:58,440
No,it's true. I did a series
of experiments when I was 12.

52
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:00,540
My father broke his clavicle.

53
00:03:01,310 --> 00:03:03,370
Is that why they sent
you to boarding school?

54
00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:06,350
No. That was a result of my
work with lasers.

55
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:14,770
- new neighbor?
- Evidently.

56
00:03:14,770 --> 00:03:17,730
Significant improvement
over the old neighbor.

57
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:22,420
200-pound transvestite with
a skin condition? Yes,she is.

58
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:25,540
- Oh,hi.
- Hi.

59
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:26,600
- Hi.
- Hi.

60
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:30,350
- Hi.
- Hi?

61
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:33,340
We don't mean to interrupt.
We live across the hall.

62
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:35,510
Oh,that's nice.

63
00:03:35,510 --> 00:03:37,720
Oh,no,uh,we don't live together.

64
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:41,640
I mean,we live together,
but in separate,

65
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:44,060
heterosexual bedrooms.

66
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:47,490
Oh. Okay,well,guess I'm
your new neighbor. Penny.

67
00:03:47,490 --> 00:03:48,880
Oh. Leonard. Sheldon.

68
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:49,910
- Hi.
- Hi.

69
00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:52,520
Hi. Hi. Hi.

70
00:03:54,140 --> 00:03:57,470
Well,uh... oh,uh,welcome
to the building.

71
00:03:57,470 --> 00:03:59,910
Oh,thank you. Maybe we
can have coffee sometime.

72
00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:01,130
- Oh,great.
- Great.

73
00:04:01,130 --> 00:04:03,040
- Great.
- Great.

74
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:06,630
- Well,uh,bye.
- Bye.

75
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:08,860
- Bye.
- Bye.

76
00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:12,830
Should we have invited her for lunch?

77
00:04:12,830 --> 00:04:15,660
No. We're gonna start season
two of battlestar galactica.

78
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:18,660
We already watched the season two dvds.

79
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:20,670
Not with commentary.

80
00:04:22,630 --> 00:04:26,500
I think we should be good neighbors and
invite her over, make her feel welcome.

81
00:04:27,010 --> 00:04:30,310
We never invited
louie-slash-louise over.

82
00:04:30,910 --> 00:04:32,600
Well... and that was wrong of us.

83
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:34,420
We need to widen our circle.

84
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:37,350
I have a very wide circle.

85
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:40,030
I have 212 friends on myspace.

86
00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:43,680
Yes,and you've never met one of them.

87
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:46,510
That's the beauty of it.

88
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:50,410
I'm gonna invite her over.

89
00:04:50,410 --> 00:04:53,020
We'll have a nice meal and... chat.

90
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:56,410
Chat? We don't chat.
At least not offline.

91
00:04:58,220 --> 00:05:01,340
Well,it's not difficult. You
just listen to what she says

92
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:04,140
and then you say something
appropriate in response.

93
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:07,140
To what end?

94
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:10,270
Hi. Again.

95
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:12,860
- Hi.
- Hi.

96
00:05:13,530 --> 00:05:16,870
Anyway,um... we brought
home indian food.

97
00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:18,970
And,um...

98
00:05:18,970 --> 00:05:21,440
I know that moving can be stressful,

99
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:23,510
and,and,I find that when
I'm undergoing stress,

100
00:05:23,510 --> 00:05:27,050
that good food and company
can have a comforting effect.

101
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,200
Also, curry is a natural laxative,
and I don't have to tell you,

102
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:36,180
that,you know,a clean colon is
just one less thing to worry about.

103
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:40,750
Leonard,I'm no expert here, but I believe
in the context of a luncheon invitation,

104
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:43,540
you might want to skip the
reference to bowel movements.

105
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:45,930
Oh,you're inviting me over to eat?

106
00:05:45,930 --> 00:05:47,960
Uh... yes.

107
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:50,050
Oh,that's so nice. I'd love to.

108
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:51,240
Great.

109
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:54,370
So,what do you guys
do for fun around here?

110
00:05:54,370 --> 00:05:57,110
Well,today we tried
masturbating for money.

111
00:06:00,690 --> 00:06:04,180
Our whole universe was
in a hot,dense state

112
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:08,190
then nearly 14 billion years
ago expansion started... wait!

113
00:06:08,190 --> 00:06:10,980
The earth began to cool the
autotrophs began to drool,

114
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:13,370
neanderthals developed
tools we built the wall

115
00:06:13,370 --> 00:06:15,520
we built the pyramids
math,science,history,

116
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:17,910
unraveling the mystery that all started

117
00:06:17,910 --> 00:06:19,030
with a big bang bang!

Season 01 Episode 01

121
00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:25,880
yourself at home.

122
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:27,550
Okay. Thank you.

123
00:06:27,550 --> 00:06:29,330
You're very welcome.

124
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:35,940
This looks like some serious
stuff. Leonard,did you do this?

125
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:38,110
Actually,that's my work.

126
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:39,890
Wow.

127
00:06:39,890 --> 00:06:44,760
Yeah. Well,it's just some quantum mechanics with
a little string theory doodling around the edges.

128
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:46,400
That part there, that's just a joke.

129
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:49,490
It's a spoof of the
born-oppenheimer approximation.

130
00:06:50,830 --> 00:06:54,380
So you're like one of those
beautiful mind genius guys.

131
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:56,760
Yeah.

132
00:06:57,890 --> 00:06:59,310
This is really impressive.

133
00:06:59,310 --> 00:07:01,880
I have a board. If you like
boards, this is my board.

134
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:04,720
Holy smokes.

135
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:08,330
If by "holy smokes" you mean a derivative
restatement of the kind of stuff

136
00:07:08,330 --> 00:07:11,730
you can find scribbled on the
wall of any men's room at mit,sure.

137
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:13,610
- What?
- Come on.

138
00:07:13,610 --> 00:07:16,970
Who hasn't seen this differential
below "here I sit, broken-hearted"?

139
00:07:17,710 --> 00:07:21,700
At least I didn't have to invent 26
dimensions just to make the mathouome ct.

140
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:23,370
I didn't invent them. They're there.

141
00:07:23,370 --> 00:07:24,370
In what universe?

142
00:07:24,370 --> 00:07:26,640
In all of them-
that is the point.

143
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:28,940
Uh... do you guys mind if I start?

144
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:31,250
Um... penny...

145
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:33,470
that's where i sit.

146
00:07:34,730 --> 00:07:36,630
So,sit next to me.

147
00:07:37,610 --> 00:07:39,920
No... I sit there.

148
00:07:40,730 --> 00:07:42,600
- What's the difference?
- What's the difference?

149
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:44,330
Here we go.

150
00:07:44,790 --> 00:07:47,770
In the winter,that seat is close
enough to the radiator to remain warm,

151
00:07:47,770 --> 00:07:50,810
and yet not so close as to
cause perspiration in the summer,

152
00:07:50,810 --> 00:07:54,640
it's directly in the path of a cross-breeze
created by opening windows there and there

153
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:57,480
it faces the television at an
angle that is neither direct,

154
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:59,000
thus discouraging conversation,

155
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,450
nor so far wide as to
create a parallax distortion.

156
00:08:01,450 --> 00:08:05,290
I could go on,but I
think I've made my point.

157
00:08:07,950 --> 00:08:09,380
Do you want me to move?

158
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:11,880
- Well...
- just sit somewhere else.

159
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:15,380
Fine.

160
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:35,090
Sheldon,sit!

161
00:08:36,330 --> 00:08:38,280
Ah.

162
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:41,080
Well,this is nice.

163
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:42,780
We don't have a lot of company over.

164
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:45,550
That's not true- koothrappali and
wolowitz come over all the time.

165
00:08:45,550 --> 00:08:46,610
Yes,I know,but...

166
00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:48,890
tuesday night we played klingon
boggle till 1:00 in the morning.

167
00:08:48,890 --> 00:08:50,080
Yeah,I remember.

168
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:51,570
I resent you saying
we don't have company.

169
00:08:51,570 --> 00:08:53,000
- I'm sorry.
- That has negative social implications.

170
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,940
I said I'm sorry!

171
00:08:56,180 --> 00:08:59,000
So... klingon boggle?

172
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,880
Yeah. It's like regular
boggle,but... in klingon.

173
00:09:06,050 --> 00:09:08,990
That's probably enough about
us. So,tell us about you.

174
00:09:08,990 --> 00:09:11,540
Um... me? Okay.

175
00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:15,410
I'm a sagittarius, which probably tells
you way more than you need to know.

176
00:09:15,410 --> 00:09:18,910
Yes. It tells us that you participate
in the mass cultural delusion

177
00:09:18,910 --> 00:09:23,010
that the sun's apparent position relative to arbitrarily
defined constellations at the time of your birth

178
00:09:23,010 --> 00:09:25,880
somehow affects your personality.

179
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:29,640
Participate in the what?

180
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:34,530
I think what sheldon's trying to say is that
sagittarius wouldn't have been our first guess.

181
00:09:34,530 --> 00:09:37,390
Oh,yeah. A lot of people
think I'm a water sign. Penny:

182
00:09:37,990 --> 00:09:39,860
Okay,let's see, what else.

183
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:41,980
Oh,I'm a vegetarian. Except for fish.

184
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:44,480
And the occasional steak. I love steak!

185
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:50,150
Well,that's interesting.
Leonard can't process corn.

186
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:56,580
Well,uh,do you have some sort of a job?

187
00:09:56,580 --> 00:09:59,400
Oh,yeah. I'm a waitress
at the cheesecake factory.

188
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:01,740
Oh... I love cheesecake.

189
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:02,880
You're lactose-intolerant.

190
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:05,230
I don't eat it- I just
think it's a good idea.

191
00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:08,880
Oh. Anyways,I'm also
writing a screenplay.

192
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:12,140
It's about this sensitive girl who
comes to L.A. From lincoln,nebraska,

193
00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:15,580
to be an actress and winds up a
waitress at the cheesecake factory.

194
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,120
So,it's based on your life.

195
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:21,030
No,I'm from omaha.

196
00:10:24,530 --> 00:10:26,660
Well,if that was movie,
I would go see it.

197
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:28,570
I know,right?

198
00:10:28,570 --> 00:10:31,360
Okay,let's see,what else... um...

199
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:33,590
guess that's about it.

200
00:10:33,590 --> 00:10:35,870
That's the story of penny.

201
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:38,230
Well,it sounds wonderful.

202
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:40,870
It was.

203
00:10:40,870 --> 00:10:43,930
Until I fell in love with
a jerk!

204
00:10:47,550 --> 00:10:49,140
What's happening?

205
00:10:51,290 --> 00:10:53,650
God,you know, four
years I lived with him.

206
00:10:53,650 --> 00:10:56,680
Four years- that's like
as long as high school.

207
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:59,050
It took you four years to
get through high school?

208
00:11:01,390 --> 00:11:04,470
It just... I can't
believe I trusted him.

209
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:11,700
Should I say something? I feel
like I should say something.

210
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:13,700
You? No,you'll only make it worse.

211
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:15,920
You want to know the most pathetic part?

212
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:19,170
Even though I hate his lying,
cheating guts...

213
00:11:19,690 --> 00:11:22,030
I still love him.

214
00:11:22,030 --> 00:11:23,420
Is that crazy?

215
00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:25,180
Yes.

216
00:11:26,770 --> 00:11:28,540
No,it's not crazy.

217
00:11:28,540 --> 00:11:31,770
It's uh... uh... it's a paradox.

218
00:11:31,770 --> 00:11:34,270
Paradoxes are part of nature.

219
00:11:34,270 --> 00:11:38,090
Think about light. If you look
at huygens, light is a wave,

220
00:11:38,090 --> 00:11:40,030
as confirmed by the double
- slit experiments,

221
00:11:40,030 --> 00:11:45,580
but then along comes albert einstein and
discovers that light behaves like particles,too.

222
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:50,570
Well,I didn't make it worse.

223
00:11:52,450 --> 00:11:54,840
I'm so sorry. I'm such a mess.

224
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:58,790
On top of everything else, I'm all gross from
moving and my stupid shower doesn't even work.

225
00:11:58,790 --> 00:12:00,830
Our shower works.

226
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:03,690
Really? Would it be
totally weird if I used it?

227
00:12:03,690 --> 00:12:04,490
Yes.

228
00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:05,470
- No.
- No?

229
00:12:05,470 --> 00:12:07,410
- No.
- No.

230
00:12:08,010 --> 00:12:09,410
It's right down the hall.

231
00:12:09,410 --> 00:12:12,890
Thanks. You guys are
really sweet.

232
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:21,730
well,this is an interesting development.

233
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:25,710
How so?

234
00:12:25,710 --> 00:12:29,870
It has been some time since we've had a
woman take her clothes off in our apartment.

235
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:35,030
That's not true. Remember at thanksgiving my
grandmother with alzheimer's had that episode?

236
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:40,560
Point taken. It has been some time since
we've had a woman take her clothes off,

237
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:42,960
after which we didn't
want to rip our eyes out.

238
00:12:44,450 --> 00:12:47,110
The worst part was watching
her carve that turkey.

239
00:12:48,190 --> 00:12:51,350
So what exactly are you
trying to accomplish here?

240
00:12:52,140 --> 00:12:53,450
Excuse me?

241
00:12:53,450 --> 00:12:55,650
That woman in there is not
going to have sex with you.

242
00:12:55,650 --> 00:12:58,210
Well,I'm not trying
to have sex with her.

243
00:12:58,210 --> 00:13:00,430
Oh,good. Then you won't be disappointed.

244
00:13:01,670 --> 00:13:03,660
What makes you think she
wouldn't have sex with me?

245
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:06,190
I'm a male and she's a female.

246
00:13:06,190 --> 00:13:09,060
Yes,but not of the same species.

247
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:11,590
I'm not going to engage
in hypotheticals here.

248
00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:13,610
I'm just trying to be a good neighbor.

249
00:13:13,610 --> 00:13:15,730
Oh,of course.

250
00:13:15,730 --> 00:13:20,600
That's not to say that if a carnal relationship
were to develop that I wouldn't participate.

251
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:24,660
However briefly.

252
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:27,740
Do you think this possibility
will be helped or hindered

253
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:31,100
when she discovers your luke
skywalker no-more-tears shampoo?

254
00:13:32,510 --> 00:13:34,490
It's darth vader shampoo.

255
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,150
luke skywalker's the conditioner.

256
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:41,560
Wait till you see this.

257
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:43,250
It's fantastic, unbelievable.

258
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:45,220
See what?

259
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:49,740
It's a stephen hawking
lecture from mit in 1974.

260
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:50,930
This isn't a good time.

261
00:13:50,930 --> 00:13:54,810
It's before he became a
creepy computer voice. Leonard:

262
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:58,900
That's great. You guys have to go.

263
00:13:58,900 --> 00:13:59,720
Why?

264
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:00,800
It's just not a good time.

265
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:03,010
Leonard has a lady over.

266
00:14:03,010 --> 00:14:05,670
Yeah,right- your
grandmother back in town?

267
00:14:07,770 --> 00:14:09,840
No. And she's not a lady.

268
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:11,670
She's just a new neighbor.

269
00:14:11,670 --> 00:14:14,480
Hang on,there really is a lady here?

270
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:15,240
Uh-huh.

271
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:18,060
And you want us out because
you're anticipating coitus?

272
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:20,540
I'm not anticipating coitus.

273
00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:21,810
So she's available for coitus?

274
00:14:21,810 --> 00:14:24,310
Can we please just stop saying "coitus"?

275
00:14:24,310 --> 00:14:27,020
Technically,that would
be "coitus interruptus. "

276
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:31,000
Hey,is there a trick to getting
it to switch from tub to shower...?

277
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,180
Oh,hi. Sorry. Hello.

278
00:14:35,690 --> 00:14:38,600
Enchant? mademoiselle.

279
00:14:39,530 --> 00:14:42,680
Howard wolowitz caltech
department of applied physics.

280
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:44,940
You may be familiar
with some of my work.

281
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:49,830
It's currently orbiting jupiter's largest moon
taking high-resolution digital photographs.

282
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:53,970
Penny. I work at the cheesecake factory.

283
00:14:53,970 --> 00:14:56,010
Come on,I'll show you
the trick with the shower.

284
00:14:56,530 --> 00:14:58,200
Bonne douche.

285
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:59,710
I'M... I'm sorry?

286
00:14:59,710 --> 00:15:01,730
It's french for "good shower. "

287
00:15:01,730 --> 00:15:04,550
It's a sentiment I can
express in six languages.

288
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:07,950
Save it for your blog,howard.

289
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:11,030
??????????

290
00:15:15,210 --> 00:15:17,710
all right, there it goes.
It sticks. I'm sorry.

291
00:15:17,710 --> 00:15:18,500
Okay,thanks.

292
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:21,430
Reyou' welcome. Oh,you're just
going to step right... okay,I'll...

293
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:24,760
- hey,leonard...
- the hair products are sheldon'S.

294
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:26,190
Okay.

295
00:15:26,190 --> 00:15:28,800
Um,can I ask you a favor?

296
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,420
A favor?

297
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:33,320
Sure,you can ask me a favor.
I would do you a favor for you.

298
00:15:34,470 --> 00:15:36,070
It's okay if you say no.

299
00:15:36,070 --> 00:15:38,330
Oh,I'll probably say yes.

300
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:42,160
It's just not the kind of thing
you ask a guy you just met.

301
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:44,630
Wow.

302
00:15:49,140 --> 00:15:52,060
I really think we should examine
the chain of causality here.

303
00:15:52,060 --> 00:15:52,890
Must we?

304
00:15:52,890 --> 00:15:55,760
Event a- a beautiful woman
stands naked in our shower.

305
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:59,480
Event b- we drive halfway across
town to retrieve a television set

306
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:01,350
from the aforementioned
woman's ex-boyfriend.

307
00:16:01,350 --> 00:16:06,650
Query- on what plane of existence is there
even a semi-rational link between these events?

308
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:10,450
She asked me to do her a favor,sheldon.

309
00:16:10,450 --> 00:16:13,160
Ah,yes. Well,that may be the
proximal cause of our journey,

310
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:17,760
but we both know it only exists in
contradistinction to the higher level distal cause.

311
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:18,690
Which is?

312
00:16:18,690 --> 00:16:20,740
You think with your penis.

313
00:16:21,410 --> 00:16:23,180
That's a biological impossibility.

314
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:24,530
And you didn't have to come.

315
00:16:24,530 --> 00:16:29,650
Oh,right,yes,I could have stayed behind and watch
wolowitz try to hit on penny in russian, arabic and farsi.

316
00:16:30,630 --> 00:16:32,520
Why can't she get her own tv?

317
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:34,430
Come on,you know how
it is with breakups.

318
00:16:34,430 --> 00:16:36,850
No,I don'T... and neither do you.

319
00:16:36,850 --> 00:16:39,420
I broke up with joyce kim.

320
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:43,010
You did not break up with joyce
kim. She defected to north korea.

321
00:16:43,010 --> 00:16:45,560
To mend her broken heart.

322
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:50,980
This situation is much less complicated.

323
00:16:50,980 --> 00:16:55,290
There's some kind of dispute between penny and
her ex-boyfriend as to who gets custody of the tv.

324
00:16:55,290 --> 00:16:57,660
She just wanted to avoid
having a scene with him.

325
00:16:57,660 --> 00:16:59,420
So we get to have a scene with him?

326
00:16:59,420 --> 00:17:02,020
No,sheldon,there's not
going to be a scene.

327
00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:03,950
There's two of us and one of him.

328
00:17:03,950 --> 00:17:06,410
Leonard,the two of us
can't even carry a tv.

329
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:11,770
So,you guys work with leonard
and sheldon at the university?

330
00:17:16,990 --> 00:17:20,020
Um,I'm sorry. Do you speak english?

331
00:17:20,020 --> 00:17:22,810
Oh,he speaks english.
Hecaust jn't speak to women.

332
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:25,520
Really? Why?

333
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:27,550
He's kind of a nerd.

334
00:17:29,930 --> 00:17:31,930
Juice box?

335
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:37,740
I'll do the talking. Man:

336
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:38,630
Yeah?

337
00:17:38,630 --> 00:17:40,680
Uh,hi,I'm leonard, this is sheldon.

338
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:42,310
- Hello.
- Let'S...

339
00:17:44,090 --> 00:17:46,630
uh,we're here to pick up penny's tv.

340
00:17:46,630 --> 00:17:47,590
Get lost.

341
00:17:47,590 --> 00:17:49,050
Okay,thanks for you time.

342
00:17:49,570 --> 00:17:51,290
We're not going to
give up just like that.

343
00:17:51,290 --> 00:17:52,760
Leonard,the tv's in the building.

344
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:55,760
We have been denied access to
the building- ergo,we are done.

345
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:57,190
Excuse me.

346
00:17:57,190 --> 00:18:01,060
If I were to give up on the first little hitch I
never would have been able to identify the fingerprints

347
00:18:01,060 --> 00:18:04,110
of string theory in the
aftermath of the big bang.

348
00:18:04,930 --> 00:18:07,480
My apologies. What's your plan?

349
00:18:21,090 --> 00:18:24,160
It's just a privilege to
watch your mind at work.

350
00:18:24,910 --> 00:18:27,830
Come on,we have a combined iq of 360.

351
00:18:27,830 --> 00:18:30,870
We should be able

352
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:36,290
what do you think their combined iq is?

353
00:18:36,290 --> 00:18:38,300
Just grab the door!

354
00:18:40,150 --> 00:18:41,860
This is it.

355
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:44,020
I'll do the talking.

356
00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:46,500
Good thinking. I'll just be the muscle.

357
00:18:53,930 --> 00:18:55,020
Yeah?

358
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:57,170
I'm leonard, this is sheldon.

359
00:18:57,170 --> 00:18:59,620
From the intercom.

360
00:19:00,230 --> 00:19:02,010
How the hell did you
get in the building?

361
00:19:02,010 --> 00:19:05,710
Uh... we're scientists.

362
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:09,630
Tell him about our iq.

363
00:19:21,650 --> 00:19:23,500
- Leonard...
- what?

364
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:24,700
My mom bought me those pants.

365
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:26,930
I'm sorry.

366
00:19:26,930 --> 00:19:28,890
You're going to have to call her.

367
00:19:31,630 --> 00:19:34,740
Sheldon,I am so sorry I
dragged you through this.

368
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:38,820
It's okay. It wasn't my first
pantsing and it won't be my last.

369
00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:40,930
And you were right about my motives.

370
00:19:40,930 --> 00:19:46,630
I was hoping to establish a relationship
with penny that might have someday led to sex.

371
00:19:47,770 --> 00:19:49,640
Well,you got me out of my pants.

372
00:19:51,730 --> 00:19:53,480
Anyway,I've learned my lesson.

373
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:55,430
She's out of my league,
I'm done with her.

374
00:19:55,430 --> 00:19:59,840
Got my work,one day I'll win the
nobel prize and then I'll die alone.

375
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:02,890
Don't think like that.
You're not going to die alone.

376
00:20:02,890 --> 00:20:05,560
Thank you,sheldon. You're a good friend.

377
00:20:07,150 --> 00:20:09,720
And you're certainly not
going to win a nobel prize.

378
00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:14,500
This is one of my favorite
places to kick back after a quest.

379
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:16,510
They have a great house ale.

380
00:20:16,510 --> 00:20:17,750
Wow,a cool tiger.

381
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:20,180
Yeah,I've had him since level ten.

382
00:20:20,950 --> 00:20:23,140
His name is buttons.

383
00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:27,990
Anyway,if you had your own game character
we could hang out, maybe go on a quest.

384
00:20:28,810 --> 00:20:30,930
Sounds interesting.

385
00:20:30,930 --> 00:20:32,200
So you'll think about it?

386
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:35,180
Oh,I don't think I'll be able
to stop thinking about it.

387
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:38,680
Smooth.

388
00:20:40,620 --> 00:20:41,360
We're home.

389
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:43,580
Oh,my god,what happened?

390
00:20:43,580 --> 00:20:49,240
Well,your ex-boyfriend sends his regards and
I think the rest is fairly self-explanatory.

391
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:50,840
I'm so sorry.

392
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:54,120
I really thought if you guys went
instead of me he wouldn't be such an ass.

393
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:56,170
No,it was a valid hypothesis.

394
00:20:56,170 --> 00:20:59,180
That was a valid...?
What is happening to you?

395
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:03,210
Really... thank you so
much for going and trying.

396
00:21:03,210 --> 00:21:06,020
You're so terrific.

397
00:21:06,670 --> 00:21:08,510
Really.

398
00:21:08,510 --> 00:21:12,210
Why don't you get some clothes on, I'll
get my purse, and dinner is on me,okay?

399
00:21:12,210 --> 00:21:13,830
- Really? Great.
- Thank you.

400
00:21:19,950 --> 00:21:22,150
You're not done with her,are you?

401
00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:26,120
Are babies will be smart and beautiful.

402
00:21:28,340 --> 00:21:31,000
Not to mention imaginary.

403
00:21:35,860 --> 00:21:38,030
- *with you,penny?
- Sure.

404
00:21:38,030 --> 00:21:40,100
We can't have thai food-
we had indian for lunch.

405
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:41,000
So?

406
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,590
They're both curry-based cuisines.

407
00:21:42,590 --> 00:21:43,510
So?

408
00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:45,560
It would be gastronomically redundant.

409
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:48,640
I can see we're going to have to
spell out everything for this girl.

410
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:51,960
Any ideas,raj?

411
00:21:53,410 --> 00:21:55,900
Uh,turn left on lake street
and head up to colorado.

412
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:58,720
I know a wonderful little
sushi bar that has karaoke.

413
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:00,750
That sounds like fun.

414
00:22:01,130 --> 00:22:06,110
Baby,baby,don't get hooked on me

415
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:12,530
oh,baby,baby,don't get hooked on me...

416
00:22:13,690 --> 00:22:15,610
I don't know what your odds
are in the world as a whole,

417
00:22:15,610 --> 00:22:17,800
but as far as the
population of this car goes,

418
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:19,870
you're a veritable mack daddy.
