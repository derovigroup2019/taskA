1
00:00:01,397 --> 00:00:03,252
Okay, if no one else was *

2
00:00:03,974 --> 00:00:05,749
We really suck at paintball.

3
00:00:07,408 --> 00:00:09,202
That was absolutely humiliating.

4
00:00:09,376 --> 00:00:12,000
Come on, some battles you win,
some battles you lose.

5
00:00:12,366 --> 00:00:16,944
Yes, but you don't have to lose
to Kyle Burnsteen Barmistva party.

6
00:00:18,413 --> 00:00:19,821
I think we have to acknolegde,

7
00:00:19,956 --> 00:00:23,226
Those was some fairly savage
* jews.

8
00:00:25,757 --> 00:00:28,188
No, we were annihilated
by our own incompetence

9
00:00:28,370 --> 00:00:30,666
and the inability
of some people to follow

10
00:00:30,994 --> 00:00:32,979
- the chain of command.
- Sheldon, let it go!

11
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:36,613
No, I want to talk about the fact
that Wolowitz shot me in the back.

12
00:00:38,119 --> 00:00:41,476
I shot you for good reason.
You were leading us into disaster.

13
00:00:42,578 --> 00:00:44,725
I was giving clear,
concise orders.

14
00:00:45,196 --> 00:00:48,592
You hid behind a tree yelling,
"Get the kid in the yarmulke!

15
00:00:49,535 --> 00:00:50,672
Oh, hey, guys.

16
00:00:51,607 --> 00:00:52,686
Morning, ma'am.

17
00:00:53,785 --> 00:00:55,695
So, how was paintball?
Did you have fun?

18
00:00:56,156 --> 00:00:59,146
Sure, if you consider being fragged
by your own troops fun.

19
00:01:00,651 --> 00:01:03,706
You clear space on your calendar-
there will be an inquiry.

20
00:01:05,305 --> 00:01:06,694
I'm having a party on Saturday,

21
00:01:06,849 --> 00:01:08,662
so if you are around,
you should come on by.

22
00:01:08,871 --> 00:01:09,952
A party?
Yeah.

23
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:12,136
A... "boy-girl" party?

24
00:01:14,467 --> 00:01:15,818
Well, there will be boys

25
00:01:16,011 --> 00:01:18,114
and there will be girls
and it is a party, so...

26
00:01:18,453 --> 00:01:21,367
It'll be a bunch of my friends.
We'll have some beer, a little dancing.

27
00:01:21,685 --> 00:01:23,759
- Dancing?
- Yeah, I don't know, Penny...

28
00:01:23,907 --> 00:01:26,582
- The thing is, we're not...
- No, we're really more of a...

29
00:01:28,445 --> 00:01:30,165
But thanks.
Thanks for thinking of us.

30
00:01:30,486 --> 00:01:32,164
Are you sure?
Come on, it's Halloween.

31
00:01:32,401 --> 00:01:33,603
A Halloween party?

32
00:01:33,893 --> 00:01:35,205
As in... costumes?

33
00:01:35,467 --> 00:01:36,702
Well, yeah.

34
00:01:45,659 --> 00:01:46,855
Is there a theme?

35
00:01:47,478 --> 00:01:48,732
Yeah, Halloween.

36
00:01:49,677 --> 00:01:52,339
Yes, but are the costumes
random, or genre-specific?

37
00:01:53,188 --> 00:01:55,291
As usual, I'm not following.

38
00:01:55,975 --> 00:01:59,670
He's asking if we can come as anyone
from science fiction, fantasy...

39
00:01:59,937 --> 00:02:01,211
- Sure.
- Comic books?

40
00:02:01,515 --> 00:02:02,443
Fine.
Anime?

41
00:02:02,655 --> 00:02:03,809
Of course.
TV, film,

42
00:02:03,986 --> 00:02:06,085
D- and-D, manga, Greek gods,
Roman gods, Norse gods-

43
00:02:06,395 --> 00:02:07,918
Anything you want!
Okay?

44
00:02:08,211 --> 00:02:10,025
Any costume you want.

45
00:02:11,407 --> 00:02:12,407
Bye.

46
00:02:14,701 --> 00:02:16,804
Gentlemen,
to the sewing machines.

47
00:02:38,809 --> 00:02:41,027
Synchro: Sixe

48
00:02:44,762 --> 00:02:45,821
I'll get it.

49
00:03:01,238 --> 00:03:02,452
Oh, no.

50
00:03:06,545 --> 00:03:09,111
Make way
for the fastest man alive!

51
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:14,150
See, this is why I wanted
to have a costume meeting.

52
00:03:14,439 --> 00:03:16,649
We all have other costumes:
We can change.

53
00:03:17,293 --> 00:03:19,836
Or we could walk right
behind each other all night

54
00:03:20,075 --> 00:03:22,390
and look like one person going
really fast.

55
00:03:29,968 --> 00:03:31,278
No, no, no.

56
00:03:31,415 --> 00:03:34,379
It's a boy-girl party,
this flash runs solo.

57
00:03:36,011 --> 00:03:39,634
How about this? Nobody gets
to be The Flash. We all change. Agreed?

58
00:03:41,230 --> 00:03:42,270
Agreed.

59
00:03:44,539 --> 00:03:45,539
I call Frodo!

60
00:03:45,887 --> 00:03:46,887
Damn!

61
00:03:57,763 --> 00:04:01,167
Sorry I'm late, but my hammer
got stuck in the door on the bus.

62
00:04:01,953 --> 00:04:03,033
You went with Thor?

63
00:04:03,235 --> 00:04:06,129
What, just because I'm Indian
I can't be a Norse god?

64
00:04:06,979 --> 00:04:09,553
"No, no,
Raj has to be an Indian god. "

65
00:04:10,088 --> 00:04:11,088
That's racism.

66
00:04:11,526 --> 00:04:12,741
I mean look at Wolowitz.

67
00:04:12,934 --> 00:04:15,096
He's not English,
but he's dressed like Peter Pan.

68
00:04:16,847 --> 00:04:18,454
Sheldon is neither
sound nor light,

69
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:20,464
but he's obviously
the Doppler effect.

70
00:04:25,184 --> 00:04:26,303
I'm not Peter Pan.

71
00:04:26,555 --> 00:04:27,769
I'm Robin Hood.

72
00:04:28,272 --> 00:04:30,159
Really?
Because I sawPeter Pan,

73
00:04:30,311 --> 00:04:32,337
and you're dressed
exactly like Cathy Rigby.

74
00:04:33,966 --> 00:04:36,725
She was a little bigger than you,
but it's basically the same look, man.

75
00:04:38,737 --> 00:04:41,633
There's something I want to talk
to you about before we go to the party.

76
00:04:41,787 --> 00:04:43,273
I don't care if anybody gets it.

77
00:04:43,524 --> 00:04:45,472
I'm going as the Doppler effect.

78
00:04:46,502 --> 00:04:48,991
- No, it's not that.
- If I have to, I can demonstrate.

79
00:04:53,818 --> 00:04:54,818
Terrific.

80
00:04:56,774 --> 00:04:59,741
This party is my first chance
for Penny to see me

81
00:05:00,034 --> 00:05:02,288
in the context of her social group,

82
00:05:02,674 --> 00:05:05,085
and I need you not
to embarrass me tonight.

83
00:05:06,536 --> 00:05:08,403
What exactly do you mean
by embarrass you?

84
00:05:09,471 --> 00:05:11,389
For example, tonight,

85
00:05:11,563 --> 00:05:14,360
no one needs to know
that my middle name is Leakey.

86
00:05:14,881 --> 00:05:16,862
But there's nothing
embarrassing about that.

87
00:05:17,055 --> 00:05:20,079
Your father worked with Louis Leakey,
a great anthropologist.

88
00:05:20,272 --> 00:05:22,140
It had nothing to do
with your bed-wetting.

89
00:05:24,461 --> 00:05:27,428
All I'm saying is that this party
is the perfect opportunity

90
00:05:27,621 --> 00:05:30,494
for Penny to see me
as a member of her peer group,

91
00:05:30,728 --> 00:05:33,807
a potential close friend,
and perhaps more,

92
00:05:35,434 --> 00:05:37,312
and I don't want to look like a dork.

93
00:05:48,218 --> 00:05:49,430
Just a heads up, fellas.

94
00:05:49,585 --> 00:05:52,112
If anyone gets lucky, I've got
a dozen condoms in my quiver.

95
00:05:55,275 --> 00:05:56,279
Hey, guys.

96
00:05:56,491 --> 00:05:57,677
Hey. Sorry we're late.

97
00:05:58,180 --> 00:05:59,993
Late?
It's 7:05.

98
00:06:00,284 --> 00:06:01,866
You said the party starts at 7:00.

99
00:06:02,718 --> 00:06:04,609
Yeah, I mean,
when you start a party at 7:00,

100
00:06:04,802 --> 00:06:07,014
no one shows up at,
you know, 7:00.

101
00:06:08,804 --> 00:06:09,941
It's 7:05.

102
00:06:11,558 --> 00:06:12,945
Yes. Yes, it is.

103
00:06:13,170 --> 00:06:15,292
Okay. Well, um, come on in.

104
00:06:23,479 --> 00:06:25,767
So, what, are all the girls
in the bathroom?

105
00:06:26,376 --> 00:06:28,541
Probably,
but in their own homes.

106
00:06:30,379 --> 00:06:32,829
So, what time does
the costume parade start?

107
00:06:33,688 --> 00:06:34,786
The parade?

108
00:06:35,109 --> 00:06:37,984
Yeah, so the judges can give out
the prizes for best costume.

109
00:06:38,153 --> 00:06:40,173
You know, most frightening,
most authentic,

110
00:06:40,559 --> 00:06:43,308
most accurate visualization
of a scientific principal.

111
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:47,127
Oh, Sheldon, I'm sorry,

112
00:06:47,339 --> 00:06:50,831
but there aren't going to be any parades
or judges or prizes.

113
00:06:52,425 --> 00:06:54,378
This party is just going to suck.

114
00:06:55,383 --> 00:06:57,047
No!
Come on, it's going to be fun,

115
00:06:57,211 --> 00:06:59,179
and you all look great.
I mean, look at you, Thor,

116
00:06:59,447 --> 00:07:00,354
and, oh,

117
00:07:00,604 --> 00:07:02,558
Peter Pan.
That's so cute.

118
00:07:03,445 --> 00:07:06,229
- Actually, he's Robin Hood.
- I'm Peter Pan.

119
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:10,313
And I got a handful of pixie dust
with your name on it.

120
00:07:12,410 --> 00:07:13,410
No, you don't.

121
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,546
What's Sheldon supposed to be?

122
00:07:18,150 --> 00:07:19,829
He's the Doppler effect.

123
00:07:20,093 --> 00:07:22,691
Yes. It's the apparent change
in the frequency of a wave

124
00:07:22,841 --> 00:07:26,704
caused by relative motion between
the source of the wave and the observer.

125
00:07:28,648 --> 00:07:31,683
Oh, sure, I see it now.
The Doppler effect.

126
00:07:32,317 --> 00:07:33,629
All right, I got to shower.

127
00:07:33,764 --> 00:07:35,819
You guys...
make yourselves comfortable.

128
00:07:39,236 --> 00:07:40,856
See?
People get it.

129
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:57,795
By Odin's beard,
this is good Chex mix.

130
00:07:58,992 --> 00:08:00,379
No, thanks. Peanuts.

131
00:08:00,573 --> 00:08:02,985
I can't afford to swell up
in these tights.

132
00:08:03,614 --> 00:08:04,866
I'm confused.

133
00:08:05,061 --> 00:08:07,742
If there's no costume parade,
what are we doing here?

134
00:08:08,663 --> 00:08:11,487
We're socializing,
meeting new people.

135
00:08:11,976 --> 00:08:13,286
Telepathically?

136
00:08:14,765 --> 00:08:16,752
Oh, hey, when
did you get here?

137
00:08:18,062 --> 00:08:21,126
Penny is wearing the worst
Catwoman costume I've ever seen.

138
00:08:21,408 --> 00:08:23,145
And that includes Halle Berry's.

139
00:08:23,423 --> 00:08:26,214
She's not Catwoman.
She's just a generic cat.

140
00:08:26,422 --> 00:08:28,307
And that's the kind of sloppy costuming

141
00:08:28,519 --> 00:08:31,189
which results from a lack
of rules and competion.

142
00:08:33,935 --> 00:08:35,523
Hey, guys, check out the sexy nurse.

143
00:08:36,469 --> 00:08:40,443
I believe it's time for me
to turn my head and cough.

144
00:08:42,541 --> 00:08:43,620
What is your move?

145
00:08:43,774 --> 00:08:45,757
I'm going to use
the mirror technique.

146
00:08:46,087 --> 00:08:48,055
She brushes her hair back,
I brush my hair back...

147
00:08:48,209 --> 00:08:50,235
She shrugs, I shrug.
Subconsciously she's thinking,

148
00:08:50,389 --> 00:08:51,952
"We're in sync.
We belong together. "

149
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:54,574
Where do you get this stuff?

150
00:08:55,159 --> 00:08:57,905
You know, psychology journals,
Internet research,

151
00:08:58,114 --> 00:09:01,502
and there's this great show on VH-1
about how to pick up girls.

152
00:09:04,566 --> 00:09:06,477
If only I had his confidence.

153
00:09:06,727 --> 00:09:08,840
I have such difficulty
speaking to women,

154
00:09:09,132 --> 00:09:10,463
or around women...

155
00:09:10,735 --> 00:09:12,918
or at times even effeminate men.

156
00:09:14,994 --> 00:09:16,537
If that's a working stethoscope,

157
00:09:16,846 --> 00:09:19,297
maybe you'd like to hear
my heart skip a beat?

158
00:09:20,352 --> 00:09:21,392
No, thanks.

159
00:09:21,711 --> 00:09:24,741
No, seriously, you can.
I have transient idiopathic arrhythmia.

160
00:09:31,922 --> 00:09:34,476
I want to get to know Penny's friends,
I just...

161
00:09:34,765 --> 00:09:37,196
I don't know
how to talk to these people.

162
00:09:37,423 --> 00:09:39,708
Well, I actually might
be able to help.

163
00:09:40,589 --> 00:09:41,593
How so?

164
00:09:41,792 --> 00:09:43,914
Like Jane Goodall
observing the apes,

165
00:09:44,290 --> 00:09:47,790
I initially saw their interactions
as confusing and unstructured.

166
00:09:48,151 --> 00:09:49,338
But patterns emerge.

167
00:09:49,484 --> 00:09:52,417
They have their own
language, if you will.

168
00:09:53,647 --> 00:09:54,687
Go on.

169
00:09:55,723 --> 00:09:58,708
It seems that the newcomer
approaches the existing group

170
00:09:58,862 --> 00:10:01,209
with the greeting,
"How wasted am I?"

171
00:10:01,537 --> 00:10:04,431
Which is met with an
approving chorus of "Dude. "

172
00:10:06,005 --> 00:10:07,064
Then what happens?

173
00:10:07,423 --> 00:10:08,813
That's as far as I've gotten.

174
00:10:10,422 --> 00:10:11,771
This is ridiculous.

175
00:10:11,929 --> 00:10:13,768
- I'm jumping in.
- Good luck.

176
00:10:14,174 --> 00:10:15,446
No, you're coming with me.

177
00:10:15,706 --> 00:10:17,269
Oh, I hardly think so.

178
00:10:17,827 --> 00:10:18,772
Come on.

179
00:10:19,412 --> 00:10:21,129
Aren't you afraid
I'll embarrass you?

180
00:10:21,283 --> 00:10:23,405
Yes; but I need a wing man.

181
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:26,788
All right, but if we're
going to use flight metaphors,

182
00:10:26,961 --> 00:10:30,601
I'm much more suited to being the guy
from the FAA analyzing wreckage.

183
00:10:36,768 --> 00:10:38,253
So what are you
supposed to be?

184
00:10:38,717 --> 00:10:41,378
Me?
I'll give you a hint.

185
00:10:45,324 --> 00:10:46,520
A choo-choo train?

186
00:10:47,031 --> 00:10:48,031
Close!

187
00:10:51,039 --> 00:10:52,817
A brain damaged choo-choo train?

188
00:10:55,540 --> 00:10:57,892
How wasted am I?

189
00:11:11,205 --> 00:11:12,342
I still don't get it.

190
00:11:12,690 --> 00:11:14,195
I'm the Doppler effect.

191
00:11:14,665 --> 00:11:16,595
If that's some sort
of learning disability,

192
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:18,158
I think it's very insensitive.

193
00:11:20,717 --> 00:11:22,987
Why don't you just tell people
you're a zebra?

194
00:11:24,024 --> 00:11:26,913
Why don't you just tell people
you're one of the seven dwarves?

195
00:11:27,202 --> 00:11:28,224
Because I'm Frodo.

196
00:11:28,484 --> 00:11:30,452
Yes, well,
I'm the Doppler effect.

197
00:11:32,482 --> 00:11:34,159
- Oh, no.
- What?

198
00:11:34,893 --> 00:11:36,437
That's Penny's ex-boyfriend.

199
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:38,454
What do you suppose
he's doing here?

200
00:11:38,742 --> 00:11:41,435
Besides disrupting the
local gravity field.

201
00:11:42,952 --> 00:11:45,476
If he were any bigger,
he'd have moons orbiting him.

202
00:11:45,901 --> 00:11:46,960
Oh, snap.

203
00:11:48,808 --> 00:11:50,741
So, I guess we'll be leaving now.

204
00:11:51,062 --> 00:11:52,430
Why should we leave?

205
00:11:52,912 --> 00:11:56,399
For all we know he crashed the party
and Penny doesn't even want him here.

206
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,077
You have a backup hypothesis?

207
00:12:00,872 --> 00:12:02,533
Maybe they want to be friends.

208
00:12:03,286 --> 00:12:04,888
Or maybe she wants
to be friends

209
00:12:05,138 --> 00:12:06,971
and he wants
something more.

210
00:12:07,356 --> 00:12:09,266
Then he and I are on equal ground.

211
00:12:09,525 --> 00:12:11,918
Yes, but you're much
closer to it than he is.

212
00:12:13,950 --> 00:12:16,328
Look, if this was 1, 500 years ago,

213
00:12:16,504 --> 00:12:18,188
by virtue of his size and strength,

214
00:12:18,373 --> 00:12:20,726
Kurt would be entitled to his
choice of female partners.

215
00:12:20,919 --> 00:12:24,194
And male partners, animal partners,
large primordial eggplants-

216
00:12:24,348 --> 00:12:26,702
pretty much whatever
tickled his fancy.

217
00:12:27,373 --> 00:12:30,149
Yes, but our society has
undergone a paradigm shift.

218
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:31,730
In the Information Age,

219
00:12:32,197 --> 00:12:34,242
you and I are the alpha males.

220
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:36,963
- We shouldn't have to back down.
- True.

221
00:12:37,334 --> 00:12:39,899
Why don't you text him that
and see if he backs down?

222
00:12:41,196 --> 00:12:42,196
5No.

223
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:46,379
I'm going to assert
my dominance face-to-face.

224
00:12:47,099 --> 00:12:49,339
Face-to-face? Are you going
to wait for him to sit down,

225
00:12:49,512 --> 00:12:51,576
or are you going to stand
on the coffee table?

226
00:12:53,557 --> 00:12:55,061
Hello, Penny.
Hello, Kurt.

227
00:12:55,414 --> 00:12:57,094
Hey, guys, are you
having a good time?

228
00:12:57,498 --> 00:12:59,022
Given the reaction to my costume,

229
00:12:59,177 --> 00:13:02,070
this party is a scathing indictment
of the American education system.

230
00:13:03,524 --> 00:13:04,952
What, you're a zebra, right?

231
00:13:06,231 --> 00:13:07,873
Yet another child left behind.

232
00:13:09,265 --> 00:13:10,828
What are you supposed to be, an elf?

233
00:13:11,534 --> 00:13:12,729
No, I'm a hobbit.

234
00:13:13,028 --> 00:13:14,166
What's the difference?

235
00:13:14,589 --> 00:13:17,553
A hobbit is a mortal halfling
inhabitant of Middle Earth,

236
00:13:17,746 --> 00:13:20,636
whereas an elf is an immortal,
tall warrior.

237
00:13:21,152 --> 00:13:23,596
So why the hell would you
want to be a hobbit?

238
00:13:24,302 --> 00:13:26,220
Because he's neither
tall nor immortal

239
00:13:26,374 --> 00:13:28,187
and none of us could be The Flash.

240
00:13:29,464 --> 00:13:32,246
Well, whatever.
Why don't you go hop off on a quest?

241
00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:33,712
I'm talking to Penny here.

242
00:13:33,859 --> 00:13:35,774
I think we're all
talking to Penny here.

243
00:13:35,986 --> 00:13:37,086
I'm not. No offense.

244
00:13:38,463 --> 00:13:39,968
Okay, maybe you didn't hear me.

245
00:13:40,174 --> 00:13:42,262
- Go away.
- All right, Kurt, be nice.

246
00:13:42,742 --> 00:13:44,168
Oh, I am being nice.

247
00:13:45,247 --> 00:13:46,501
Right, little buddy?

248
00:13:49,581 --> 00:13:53,150
I understand your impulse
to try to physically intimidate me.

249
00:13:53,445 --> 00:13:55,938
I mean, you can't compete
with me on an intellectual level

250
00:13:56,093 --> 00:13:58,446
so you're driven
to animalistic puffery.

251
00:13:58,967 --> 00:14:00,838
You calling me a puffy animal?

252
00:14:01,471 --> 00:14:03,357
Of course not.
No, he's not.

253
00:14:03,530 --> 00:14:04,823
You're not, right, Leonard?

254
00:14:05,824 --> 00:14:07,889
No, I said "animalistic. "

255
00:14:08,377 --> 00:14:10,132
Of course
we're all animals, but,

256
00:14:10,425 --> 00:14:13,384
some of us have climbed a little higher
on the evolutionary tree.

257
00:14:13,596 --> 00:14:15,506
If he understands that,
you're in trouble.

258
00:14:15,899 --> 00:14:17,539
So, what, I'm unevolved?

259
00:14:17,890 --> 00:14:19,028
You're in trouble.

260
00:14:20,115 --> 00:14:23,356
You use a lot of big words
for such a little dwarf.

261
00:14:23,559 --> 00:14:24,954
Okay, Kurt, please.

262
00:14:25,533 --> 00:14:27,366
It's okay.
I can handle this.

263
00:14:28,215 --> 00:14:29,410
I am not a dwarf,

264
00:14:29,867 --> 00:14:31,042
I'm a hobbit.

265
00:14:31,575 --> 00:14:32,559
A hobbit.

266
00:14:32,870 --> 00:14:35,282
Are misfiring neurons
in your hippocampus preventing

267
00:14:35,456 --> 00:14:37,732
the conversion from short-term
to long-term memory?

268
00:14:40,676 --> 00:14:42,519
Okay, now you're starting
to make me mad.

269
00:14:43,935 --> 00:14:46,812
A homo habilis discovering his
opposable thumbs says what?

270
00:14:48,646 --> 00:14:49,646
What?

271
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:55,870
I think I've made my point.

272
00:14:56,144 --> 00:14:59,096
Yeah? How about I make a point
out of your pointy little head?

273
00:14:59,508 --> 00:15:01,939
Let me remind you,
while my moral support is absolute,

274
00:15:02,108 --> 00:15:04,984
in a physical confrontation,
I will be less than useless.

275
00:15:05,266 --> 00:15:07,179
There's not going
to be a confrontation.

276
00:15:07,507 --> 00:15:10,999
In fact, I doubt if he can
even spell "confrontation. "

277
00:15:13,631 --> 00:15:15,115
C- O-N...

278
00:15:16,542 --> 00:15:17,738
frontation!

279
00:15:18,794 --> 00:15:20,588
Kurt, put him down this instant!

280
00:15:20,807 --> 00:15:21,805
He started it!

281
00:15:22,005 --> 00:15:23,840
I don't care. I'm finishing it.
Put him down!

282
00:15:25,014 --> 00:15:26,014
Fine.

283
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:30,035
You're one lucky little leprechaun.

284
00:15:32,070 --> 00:15:33,187
He's a hobbit!

285
00:15:33,925 --> 00:15:35,139
I got your back.

286
00:15:36,679 --> 00:15:37,679
Are you okay?

287
00:15:37,982 --> 00:15:39,101
Yeah, I'm fine.

288
00:15:42,598 --> 00:15:44,411
It's a good party,
thanks for having us.

289
00:15:44,563 --> 00:15:46,169
It's just getting a little late, so...

290
00:15:48,168 --> 00:15:49,789
All right, thank you for coming.

291
00:15:53,198 --> 00:15:54,277
Happy Halloween.

292
00:15:58,156 --> 00:15:59,372
If it's any consolation,

293
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:02,517
I thought that homo habilis line
really put him in his place.

294
00:16:12,103 --> 00:16:13,103
What's that?

295
00:16:13,491 --> 00:16:14,504
Tea.

296
00:16:15,439 --> 00:16:16,654
When people are upset,

297
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:19,683
the cultural convention is
to bring them hot beverages.

298
00:16:26,479 --> 00:16:27,479
There, there.

299
00:16:30,805 --> 00:16:32,078
You want to talk about it?

300
00:16:32,387 --> 00:16:33,506
- No.
- Good.

301
00:16:35,142 --> 00:16:37,193
"There, there"
was really all I had.

302
00:16:38,854 --> 00:16:41,232
- Good night, Sheldon.
- Good night, Leonard.

303
00:16:50,918 --> 00:16:52,711
I just wanted to make sure
you were okay.

304
00:16:52,905 --> 00:16:54,005
I'm fine.

305
00:16:56,078 --> 00:16:58,417
I am so sorry about
what happened.

306
00:16:58,677 --> 00:17:00,122
It's not your fault.

307
00:17:00,381 --> 00:17:01,381
Yes, it is.

308
00:17:01,535 --> 00:17:04,646
That's why I broke up with him.
He always does stuff like that.

309
00:17:06,263 --> 00:17:07,691
So why was he at your party?

310
00:17:11,669 --> 00:17:13,256
I ran into him last week

311
00:17:13,606 --> 00:17:16,898
and he was just all apologetic
about how he's changed.

312
00:17:17,218 --> 00:17:19,378
And he was just
going on and on and...

313
00:17:19,606 --> 00:17:22,860
I believed him and I'm an idiot
because I always believe guys like that.

314
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:26,674
I can't go back to my
party because he's there.

315
00:17:26,908 --> 00:17:28,641
You don't want to hear this
and I'm upset

316
00:17:28,796 --> 00:17:30,802
and I'm really drunk
and I just want to...

317
00:17:40,213 --> 00:17:41,350
There, there.

318
00:17:45,504 --> 00:17:47,028
God, what is wrong with me?

319
00:17:47,211 --> 00:17:48,946
Nothing, you're perfect.

320
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:51,469
- I'm not perfect.
- Yes, you are.

321
00:17:54,518 --> 00:17:56,315
You really think so, don't you?

322
00:18:14,208 --> 00:18:16,242
How much have you
had to drink tonight?

323
00:18:18,975 --> 00:18:20,943
Just... a lot.

324
00:18:22,918 --> 00:18:25,103
Are you sure that your being drunk

325
00:18:25,318 --> 00:18:26,939
and your being angry with Kurt

326
00:18:27,194 --> 00:18:29,567
doesn't have something to do
with what's going on here?

327
00:18:31,229 --> 00:18:32,443
It might.

328
00:18:35,742 --> 00:18:37,207
Boy, you're really smart.

329
00:18:37,658 --> 00:18:39,317
Yeah, I'm a frickin' genius.

330
00:18:44,798 --> 00:18:46,437
Leonard, you are so great.

331
00:18:46,906 --> 00:18:48,664
Why can't all guys be like you?

332
00:18:49,909 --> 00:18:53,403
Because if all guys were like me,
the human race couldn't survive.

333
00:18:58,189 --> 00:18:59,385
I should probably go.

334
00:18:59,805 --> 00:19:00,805
Probably.

335
00:19:10,283 --> 00:19:11,286
Thank you.

336
00:19:22,341 --> 00:19:24,411
That's right,
you saw what you saw.

337
00:19:26,698 --> 00:19:28,627
That's how we roll in the Shire.

338
00:19:37,843 --> 00:19:38,843
Coming.

339
00:19:44,196 --> 00:19:45,974
Hey, have you seen Koothrappali?

340
00:19:46,898 --> 00:19:48,228
He's not here.

341
00:19:48,606 --> 00:19:50,751
Maybe the Avengers summoned him.

342
00:19:52,409 --> 00:19:55,037
He's not the Marvel Comics Thor,
he's the original Norse god.

343
00:19:55,468 --> 00:19:57,343
Thank you for the clarification.

344
00:19:57,964 --> 00:20:00,735
- I'm supposed to give him a ride home.
- I'm sure he'll be fine.

345
00:20:00,923 --> 00:20:02,349
He has his hammer.

346
00:20:10,387 --> 00:20:13,443
I have to say,
you are an amazing man.

347
00:20:14,643 --> 00:20:17,134
You're gentle,
and passionate.

348
00:20:18,156 --> 00:20:19,351
And, my God,

349
00:20:19,804 --> 00:20:22,100
you are such a good listener.
