<i>Previously on</i>
The Big Bang Theory...

2
00:00:02,518 --> 00:00:06,103
I was offered a summer research
fellowship at Princeton.

3
00:00:07,773 --> 00:00:09,773
Princeton.

4
00:00:09,775 --> 00:00:11,725
A fine institution.

5
00:00:13,028 --> 00:00:15,229
The place where
Albert Einstein taught,

6
00:00:15,231 --> 00:00:17,314
and where Leonard got his PhD,

7
00:00:17,316 --> 00:00:19,967
so it may have gone downhill.

8
00:00:21,153 --> 00:00:23,320
And just remember,
I'm proud of you.

9
00:00:23,322 --> 00:00:25,322
And I support you
in all that you do.

10
00:00:25,324 --> 00:00:26,573
Thank you.

11
00:00:26,575 --> 00:00:27,825
That means a lot.

12
00:00:27,827 --> 00:00:29,076
Oh, and one last thing.

13
00:00:29,078 --> 00:00:31,879
If you find yourself
working with a male scientist,

14
00:00:31,881 --> 00:00:34,548
who's as smart as
me, as tall as me,

15
00:00:34,550 --> 00:00:36,166
and has hair like Thor,

16
00:00:36,168 --> 00:00:38,552
well, then, I want you to
step away from the situation

17
00:00:38,554 --> 00:00:40,721
and call me immediately.

18
00:00:43,008 --> 00:00:44,808
How are you settling in?

19
00:00:44,810 --> 00:00:46,310
Pretty well.

20
00:00:46,312 --> 00:00:48,428
Princeton has
a beautiful campus.

21
00:00:48,430 --> 00:00:50,180
Now, I've learned some fun facts
about New Jersey

22
00:00:50,182 --> 00:00:51,648
to help you make small talk.

23
00:00:51,650 --> 00:00:53,033
Would you like to know

24
00:00:53,035 --> 00:00:56,153
the state bird
or the murder rate?

25
00:00:56,939 --> 00:00:58,906
They're both shocking.

26
00:01:00,242 --> 00:01:02,242
Actually, I want to hear
about you.

27
00:01:02,244 --> 00:01:03,777
How are things at home?

28
00:01:03,779 --> 00:01:06,780
Well, I'm a lot less likely
to see an Eastern Goldfinch

29
00:01:06,782 --> 00:01:08,799
or be murdered,
I'll tell you that.

30
00:01:10,085 --> 00:01:11,535
I miss you.

31
00:01:11,537 --> 00:01:12,920
I miss you, too.

32
00:01:12,922 --> 00:01:14,838
It's so strange, earlier today
I ended a sentence

33
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:16,507
with a preposition

34
00:01:16,509 --> 00:01:19,459
and you weren't there
to correct my grammar.

35
00:01:19,461 --> 00:01:22,529
I'm sorry you had
to go through that.

36
00:01:22,531 --> 00:01:24,631
In fact,

37
00:01:24,633 --> 00:01:27,651
that's when
I started to really miss you.

38
00:01:28,954 --> 00:01:31,989
You know you just split
an infinitive.

39
00:01:31,991 --> 00:01:34,858
Did I?

40
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:37,561
Are you gonna teach me a lesson?

41
00:01:39,281 --> 00:01:40,981
I am.

42
00:01:42,301 --> 00:01:43,851
It is naughty to put an adverb

43
00:01:43,853 --> 00:01:47,454
between the word "to"
and the verb stem.

44
00:01:47,456 --> 00:01:49,857
What are you gonna do about it?

45
00:01:49,859 --> 00:01:53,043
I'm going to admonish you.

46
00:01:53,045 --> 00:01:55,662
Vigorously?

47
00:01:55,664 --> 00:01:59,366
That's the only kind
of admonishing I do.

48
00:02:00,636 --> 00:02:03,870
? Our whole universe
was in a hot, dense state ?

49
00:02:03,872 --> 00:02:07,407
? Then nearly 14 billion years
ago expansion started... Wait! ?

50
00:02:07,409 --> 00:02:09,176
? The Earth began to cool ?

51
00:02:09,178 --> 00:02:11,962
? The autotrophs began to drool,
Neanderthals developed tools ?

52
00:02:11,964 --> 00:02:13,864
? We built the Wall ?
? <i>We built the pyramids</i> ?

53
00:02:13,866 --> 00:02:16,700
? Math, Science, History,
unraveling the mystery ?

54
00:02:16,702 --> 00:02:18,885
? That all started
with a big bang ?

55
00:02:18,887 --> 00:02:19,346
? <i>Bang!</i> ?

How's Sheldon doing
with Amy gone?

59
00:02:26,817 --> 00:02:28,266
Well, the last three nights

60
00:02:28,268 --> 00:02:30,519
I've had to take him
to get a haircut,

61
00:02:30,521 --> 00:02:33,155
to the train store,
and to a Walgreens in Arcadia

62
00:02:33,157 --> 00:02:36,274
where they still have
the "good ibuprofen."

63
00:02:37,328 --> 00:02:39,845
Now ask me how I'm doing
with Amy gone.

64
00:02:39,847 --> 00:02:41,496
How are you doing with...
Shut up.

65
00:02:42,449 --> 00:02:45,534
If you'd like,
we can help you out.

66
00:02:45,536 --> 00:02:47,002
Oh, that would be great.

67
00:02:47,004 --> 00:02:48,503
I mean, not me,
I've got a wife and child,

68
00:02:48,505 --> 00:02:52,007
but this one posts video of
himself flossing on Instagram.

69
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:55,544
It was a tutorial.

70
00:02:56,930 --> 00:02:59,064
And yes, I'm happy to keep
Sheldon company.

71
00:02:59,066 --> 00:03:01,850
Great. Tonight he wants to
look at ladders at Home Depot.

72
00:03:01,852 --> 00:03:03,051
Oh, why does he need a ladder?

73
00:03:03,053 --> 00:03:04,603
He doesn't; he just
likes looking at them.

74
00:03:04,605 --> 00:03:06,388
Bring a book.

75
00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:07,856
Gentlemen.

76
00:03:07,858 --> 00:03:09,524
You may remember Dr. Nowitzki,

77
00:03:09,526 --> 00:03:11,843
She's back at Caltech
for her postdoc.

78
00:03:11,845 --> 00:03:13,111
- Hello.
- Hello. - Hi.

79
00:03:13,113 --> 00:03:14,396
Oh, let me bring
a chair for you.

80
00:03:14,398 --> 00:03:15,814
Oh, thanks.

81
00:03:15,816 --> 00:03:16,982
Dr. Nowitzki's
going to tell me

82
00:03:16,984 --> 00:03:18,650
about the work
she did at CERN.

83
00:03:18,652 --> 00:03:22,320
And she brought me this
duty-free Toblerone.

84
00:03:22,322 --> 00:03:24,122
Oh. I love those.

85
00:03:24,124 --> 00:03:26,408
Let's sit somewhere else.

86
00:03:30,581 --> 00:03:32,581
What just happened?

87
00:03:32,583 --> 00:03:36,918
A stranger just lured Sheldon
away with a candy bar.

88
00:03:39,139 --> 00:03:41,590
Wait, isn't she the grad student
that used to follow him around?

89
00:03:41,592 --> 00:03:43,425
Oh, yeah.

90
00:03:43,427 --> 00:03:47,562
Back before he hit puberty
and grew man parts.

91
00:03:47,564 --> 00:03:49,648
So what do you guys
think that's about?

92
00:03:49,650 --> 00:03:51,266
Knowing Sheldon, nothing.

93
00:03:51,268 --> 00:03:54,603
So, tell me about your
scalar dark energy experiment.

94
00:03:54,605 --> 00:03:56,071
Not 'til you tell me
about your latest paper

95
00:03:56,073 --> 00:03:57,355
on quantum loop theory.

96
00:03:57,357 --> 00:04:00,742
Oh. You must be one of those
dessert before dinner people.

97
00:04:02,913 --> 00:04:07,215
He just made her laugh,
something's wrong.

98
00:04:07,217 --> 00:04:09,584
Do you see the way
she's looking at him?

99
00:04:09,586 --> 00:04:12,838
Yeah. Like Bernadette
used to look at me.

100
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:15,791
I keep telling you,
close the bathroom door.

101
00:04:17,928 --> 00:04:19,344
Ah, did you see that?

102
00:04:19,346 --> 00:04:21,513
She just touched his hand
and he didn't swat it away.

103
00:04:21,515 --> 00:04:23,682
What is happening?

104
00:04:23,684 --> 00:04:27,602
Okay, the simplest explanation
is usually the right one.

105
00:04:27,604 --> 00:04:29,137
Which is?

106
00:04:29,139 --> 00:04:32,307
That ain't Sheldon.

107
00:04:34,645 --> 00:04:36,061
Not only did
they eat together,

108
00:04:36,063 --> 00:04:37,979
Leonard said he
made her laugh.

109
00:04:37,981 --> 00:04:39,131
That's nothing,

110
00:04:39,133 --> 00:04:41,583
Howie said
she touched his hand.

111
00:04:41,585 --> 00:04:42,818
Did he Purell?

112
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:45,454
No.

113
00:04:45,456 --> 00:04:47,055
I cannot believe Leonard

114
00:04:47,057 --> 00:04:50,542
mentioned the Toblerone
but left that part out.

115
00:04:50,544 --> 00:04:52,661
Should we call Amy?

116
00:04:52,663 --> 00:04:55,263
I don't know; we shouldn't worry
her if it's nothing.

117
00:04:55,265 --> 00:04:57,499
I guess we could wait till
we have more information

118
00:04:57,501 --> 00:04:59,000
about this girl.
Yeah.

119
00:04:59,002 --> 00:05:01,253
Do you think living with Amy

120
00:05:01,255 --> 00:05:03,839
has somehow stirred up
Sheldon's...

121
00:05:03,841 --> 00:05:06,308
sexual appetite?

122
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:09,611
Ugh.

123
00:05:11,365 --> 00:05:14,599
How can you think that?

124
00:05:16,153 --> 00:05:19,187
Why would you even
put those words together?

125
00:05:19,189 --> 00:05:20,405
All right,
then we agree.

126
00:05:20,407 --> 00:05:21,773
He's not making
any moves,

127
00:05:21,775 --> 00:05:23,542
it's this
Dr. Ramona chick.

128
00:05:23,544 --> 00:05:26,528
Nowitzki. I Googled her,
she's pretty cute.

129
00:05:26,530 --> 00:05:28,163
Really? All I
got from Leonard

130
00:05:28,165 --> 00:05:32,417
was the Toblerone bar had nuts.

131
00:05:33,537 --> 00:05:34,870
And get this,

132
00:05:34,872 --> 00:05:37,205
I saw an articulating ladder

133
00:05:37,207 --> 00:05:39,875
with dual-leg leveling,
which delivers stability

134
00:05:39,877 --> 00:05:42,494
and adaptability
to uneven terrain.

135
00:05:42,496 --> 00:05:46,047
Sounds like a big night.

136
00:05:46,049 --> 00:05:48,133
Yeah. Raj made the funniest
joke, he said,

137
00:05:48,135 --> 00:05:51,386
"Which is the best ladder to use
to hang myself?"

138
00:05:54,808 --> 00:05:57,609
So you're keeping busy?
You're not lonely?

139
00:05:57,611 --> 00:05:58,944
Oh, not at all.

140
00:05:58,946 --> 00:06:01,229
I've had outings with Leonard
and Raj in the evening,

141
00:06:01,231 --> 00:06:04,249
and-- oh, I had lunch
with Dr. Nowitzki.

142
00:06:04,251 --> 00:06:05,333
Who's he?

143
00:06:05,335 --> 00:06:06,985
Oh, Dr. Nowitzki is a woman.

144
00:06:06,987 --> 00:06:08,153
Oh. Really?

145
00:06:08,155 --> 00:06:09,487
Uh, when did you meet her?

146
00:06:09,489 --> 00:06:10,488
Many years ago.

147
00:06:10,490 --> 00:06:12,240
Back when she was
a grad student.

148
00:06:12,242 --> 00:06:14,075
She's always been
a huge fan of my work,

149
00:06:14,077 --> 00:06:16,461
and now she's doing
research at Caltech.

150
00:06:17,447 --> 00:06:20,432
Huge fan, you say?

151
00:06:20,434 --> 00:06:22,467
Yes. I think you'd like her.

152
00:06:22,469 --> 00:06:25,387
She's extremely intelligent,
just like you.

153
00:06:25,389 --> 00:06:27,722
Unlike you,
she's tall, blonde

154
00:06:27,724 --> 00:06:30,759
and used to be
an Olympic swimmer.

155
00:06:32,696 --> 00:06:35,096
That's terrific.
I'll call you right back.

156
00:06:37,651 --> 00:06:39,067
Oh, hey, Amy.

157
00:06:39,069 --> 00:06:42,153
I gave you one job!

158
00:06:43,173 --> 00:06:44,322
Keep an eye on him.

159
00:06:44,324 --> 00:06:46,274
How hard is that?

160
00:06:46,276 --> 00:06:47,909
We thought you meant

161
00:06:47,911 --> 00:06:50,695
not letting him
run out into traffic.

162
00:06:52,082 --> 00:06:54,115
Which he only did once.

163
00:06:54,117 --> 00:06:55,450
Yeah.

164
00:06:55,452 --> 00:06:57,869
Why didn't you tell me?

165
00:06:57,871 --> 00:06:59,554
We didn't want you to worry.

166
00:06:59,556 --> 00:07:01,172
Should I worry?

167
00:07:01,174 --> 00:07:02,540
No. Come on,
it's Sheldon.

168
00:07:02,542 --> 00:07:04,292
Nothing is gonna happen.

169
00:07:04,294 --> 00:07:05,877
That's what you said to me
when I started dating him.

170
00:07:05,879 --> 00:07:07,345
And then five years later,

171
00:07:07,347 --> 00:07:10,131
bingo-bango, something happened.

172
00:07:10,133 --> 00:07:12,767
Yeah, but you're gonna
be back in three months.

173
00:07:12,769 --> 00:07:14,135
You don't get it.

174
00:07:14,137 --> 00:07:16,605
I've been smacking that
ketchup bottle for a long time.

175
00:07:16,607 --> 00:07:18,340
All she's got to do
is tip it over

176
00:07:18,342 --> 00:07:21,192
and point it at her fries.

177
00:07:21,194 --> 00:07:23,311
Well, what do you
want us to do?

178
00:07:23,313 --> 00:07:24,646
I don't know.

179
00:07:24,648 --> 00:07:26,147
Might be the New Jersey talking,

180
00:07:26,149 --> 00:07:29,985
but this Nowitzki broad
needs to disappear.

181
00:07:29,987 --> 00:07:32,070
That's ridiculous.

182
00:07:32,072 --> 00:07:33,538
As far as we know,

183
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:36,374
all that happened is two
scientists had lunch.

184
00:07:36,376 --> 00:07:37,993
Yeah, but one of
those scientists

185
00:07:37,995 --> 00:07:40,328
is a tall,
blonde Olympic swimmer.

186
00:07:40,330 --> 00:07:43,014
Come on. Looks don't matter
to Sheldon.

187
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:47,419
Because he only
has eyes for you.

188
00:07:48,305 --> 00:07:49,671
Nice try.

189
00:07:49,673 --> 00:07:52,057
Thanks.
I was scrambling.

190
00:07:54,811 --> 00:07:56,227
It's unbelievable.

191
00:07:56,229 --> 00:07:58,063
Sheldon has lunch
with another woman

192
00:07:58,065 --> 00:08:00,682
and somehow my wife
yells at me.

193
00:08:00,684 --> 00:08:02,517
Penny laid into me, too.

194
00:08:02,519 --> 00:08:07,188
Apparently, I'm overly fixated
on premium Swiss chocolate bars.

195
00:08:07,190 --> 00:08:10,041
Can you even eat those things?

196
00:08:10,043 --> 00:08:11,860
If I take a Lactaid
a half-hour before

197
00:08:11,862 --> 00:08:13,995
and some Pepto right after.

198
00:08:13,997 --> 00:08:15,580
Sounds like a lot of work.

199
00:08:15,582 --> 00:08:17,866
Yeah. Eh, I'm worth it.

200
00:08:19,036 --> 00:08:20,502
Guys. Focus.

201
00:08:20,504 --> 00:08:22,203
Should we do something
about Nowitzki?

202
00:08:22,205 --> 00:08:24,506
Like what?

203
00:08:24,508 --> 00:08:26,041
Uh, well, she's single,

204
00:08:26,043 --> 00:08:28,677
so if somebody else asks her out
and she says yes,

205
00:08:28,679 --> 00:08:30,879
then we know
she's not into Sheldon.

206
00:08:30,881 --> 00:08:32,597
I'll do it.

207
00:08:36,353 --> 00:08:38,887
No offense, Stuart,

208
00:08:38,889 --> 00:08:41,022
but Th-Th-the
woman's a doctor.

209
00:08:41,024 --> 00:08:43,408
So? Doctors like me.

210
00:08:43,410 --> 00:08:45,443
Whenever I see mine he calls in

211
00:08:45,445 --> 00:08:48,563
a bunch of other
doctors to have a look.

212
00:08:50,450 --> 00:08:52,617
She's not that
kind of doctor.

213
00:08:52,619 --> 00:08:53,985
Oh.

214
00:08:53,987 --> 00:08:55,403
Well, her loss.

215
00:08:55,405 --> 00:08:59,574
I've been called
a genuine medical oddity.

216
00:09:04,898 --> 00:09:06,664
Actually, I was
going to suggest me.

217
00:09:06,666 --> 00:09:09,634
Great. Anybody's
better than, mmm.

218
00:09:10,971 --> 00:09:12,303
Excuse me.

219
00:09:12,305 --> 00:09:14,305
They took out my spleen
and gallbladder,

220
00:09:14,307 --> 00:09:16,508
not my feelings.

221
00:09:23,850 --> 00:09:25,183
Dr. Nowitzki.

222
00:09:25,185 --> 00:09:27,569
Good to see you.
Good to see you, too.

223
00:09:27,571 --> 00:09:28,903
May I join you?

224
00:09:28,905 --> 00:09:30,405
No.

225
00:09:32,676 --> 00:09:35,110
Good to see you.

226
00:09:38,048 --> 00:09:40,665
We should call Guinness,
that might be a record.

227
00:09:42,035 --> 00:09:44,035
She's clearly having
a working lunch

228
00:09:44,037 --> 00:09:46,371
and preferred to eat alone.

229
00:09:46,373 --> 00:09:48,840
Dr. Cooper, over here.

230
00:09:50,427 --> 00:09:53,962
I could have made her
very happy.

231
00:09:53,964 --> 00:09:56,681
You kept walking.
I think you did.

232
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:01,636
Do you really think
there's reason to worry?

233
00:10:01,638 --> 00:10:03,888
Yeah, she's definitely
going after Sheldon.

234
00:10:03,890 --> 00:10:05,974
I made a play for her
and she shot me down.

235
00:10:05,976 --> 00:10:08,076
All right, well,
that doesn't prove anything.

236
00:10:08,078 --> 00:10:11,813
Yeah, there's a million reasons
a woman would shoot Raj down.

237
00:10:13,316 --> 00:10:15,316
Like, really, a million?

238
00:10:15,318 --> 00:10:16,484
Fine, hundreds.

239
00:10:16,486 --> 00:10:17,786
Thank you.

240
00:10:17,788 --> 00:10:19,788
The point is
this could be nothing

241
00:10:19,790 --> 00:10:22,373
and we are all overreacting.

242
00:10:22,375 --> 00:10:23,958
Hey, everybody.

243
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:25,326
This is my friend,

244
00:10:25,328 --> 00:10:26,795
Dr. Nowitzki.
Hi.

245
00:10:26,797 --> 00:10:29,914
Hi.

246
00:10:29,916 --> 00:10:33,168
We just went swimming.

247
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:38,877
And you actually
got in a pool?

248
00:10:38,879 --> 00:10:40,462
I was scared,

249
00:10:40,464 --> 00:10:44,382
but I told myself it's
just a big bathtub.

250
00:10:45,469 --> 00:10:46,635
Then I got scared again
'cause there are

251
00:10:46,637 --> 00:10:48,553
all these strangers
in my bathtub.

252
00:10:49,489 --> 00:10:51,222
I was proud of him--
a lot of people

253
00:10:51,224 --> 00:10:53,058
don't put their face in
the water on the first day.

254
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:56,661
Well, I was hiding from a
bee, but it still counts.

255
00:10:58,448 --> 00:11:01,566
Can I just squeeze in here?

256
00:11:04,121 --> 00:11:06,655
So, Sheldon, have
you talked to Amy?

257
00:11:06,657 --> 00:11:08,289
Yes, we Skyped this morning

258
00:11:08,291 --> 00:11:09,908
and I'm sure I'll check in
with her before I go to sleep.

259
00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:11,242
Sheldon talks about her

260
00:11:11,244 --> 00:11:12,994
all the time.
I can't wait to meet her.

261
00:11:12,996 --> 00:11:14,329
That is true.

262
00:11:14,331 --> 00:11:17,782
She keeps asking how long
Amy's going to be gone.

263
00:11:19,386 --> 00:11:21,553
Uh, so, Ramona,
tell us about yourself.

264
00:11:21,555 --> 00:11:23,204
Do you, do you
have a boyfriend?

265
00:11:23,206 --> 00:11:25,757
Leonard, your wife
is sitting right here.

266
00:11:25,759 --> 00:11:27,676
What are you doing?

267
00:11:30,097 --> 00:11:32,681
No, my work doesn't leave me a
lot of time for relationships.

268
00:11:32,683 --> 00:11:34,933
I think you made that
very clear.

269
00:11:34,935 --> 00:11:38,520
She was part of the
American team at CERN.

270
00:11:38,522 --> 00:11:41,606
I had a front row seat when
they detected the Higgs boson.

271
00:11:41,608 --> 00:11:43,174
Do you know,

272
00:11:43,176 --> 00:11:45,026
I've corresponded
with Peter Higgs.

273
00:11:45,028 --> 00:11:46,611
Would you like to see
some of his letters?

274
00:11:46,613 --> 00:11:48,446
Absolutely.
I'll get them.

275
00:11:48,448 --> 00:11:50,699
Well, hang on,
I'll come with you.

276
00:11:50,701 --> 00:11:52,033
Oh, fun.

277
00:11:52,035 --> 00:11:54,202
Like a play date.

278
00:11:56,707 --> 00:11:58,373
Okay, correct me if I'm wrong,
but isn't that exactly

279
00:11:58,375 --> 00:12:00,992
what we were supposed to stop
from happening?

280
00:12:00,994 --> 00:12:03,128
I threw my body at them,

281
00:12:03,130 --> 00:12:05,764
what else did you want me to do?

282
00:12:06,566 --> 00:12:08,983
You think you should call Amy?

283
00:12:08,985 --> 00:12:11,269
You got fingers and a mouth,
you call her.

284
00:12:14,274 --> 00:12:15,890
Here you go.

285
00:12:15,892 --> 00:12:17,809
Are these all
from Peter Higgs?

286
00:12:17,811 --> 00:12:19,144
Hmm? Oh, no, no, no.

287
00:12:19,146 --> 00:12:20,528
They're from many
famous people.

288
00:12:20,530 --> 00:12:21,896
See? Oh, like this one.

289
00:12:21,898 --> 00:12:23,398
This is from
Patrick Stewart.

290
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:25,900
It says if I come
to his house again,

291
00:12:25,902 --> 00:12:28,236
I get to meet his dogs.

292
00:12:31,875 --> 00:12:33,908
Oh, excuse me.

293
00:12:35,462 --> 00:12:38,580
Hello, Sheldon.
Oh, hello, Amy.

294
00:12:39,716 --> 00:12:40,915
I was missing you again.

295
00:12:40,917 --> 00:12:42,600
I miss you, too.

296
00:12:42,602 --> 00:12:44,085
Hey, this is good timing.

297
00:12:44,087 --> 00:12:46,921
Remember that Dr. Nowitzki
I told you about?

298
00:12:46,923 --> 00:12:48,323
She's right here.

299
00:12:48,325 --> 00:12:51,493
Sh-she's what?

300
00:12:52,429 --> 00:12:54,312
Hello.

301
00:12:54,314 --> 00:12:56,848
Hi.

302
00:12:56,850 --> 00:12:58,349
So nice to meet you.

303
00:12:58,351 --> 00:13:00,285
Uh-huh.

304
00:13:02,405 --> 00:13:04,773
Hang on.

305
00:13:04,775 --> 00:13:06,908
Hello.

306
00:13:06,910 --> 00:13:09,778
A little late, Leonard.

307
00:13:09,780 --> 00:13:11,780
I'm sorry.

308
00:13:11,782 --> 00:13:14,032
What is Leonard doing
calling you at this hour?

309
00:13:14,034 --> 00:13:16,167
It's not important.

310
00:13:16,169 --> 00:13:19,287
I must tell you, that seems
a little inappropriate.

311
00:13:19,289 --> 00:13:20,672
Don't you agree?

312
00:13:20,674 --> 00:13:21,873
I do.

313
00:13:21,875 --> 00:13:23,625
See?

314
00:13:23,627 --> 00:13:25,794
We both think so.

315
00:13:28,165 --> 00:13:29,681
All right, this
is making me crazy.

316
00:13:29,683 --> 00:13:30,949
Somebody's got
to go over there.

317
00:13:30,951 --> 00:13:33,718
You got feet and legs,
you do it.

318
00:13:36,439 --> 00:13:37,522
Will you with me?

319
00:13:37,524 --> 00:13:40,692
To do what?
Shake a can of nickels at them?

320
00:13:41,812 --> 00:13:44,562
We're being ridiculous.

321
00:13:44,564 --> 00:13:45,980
There's no way a woman
that attractive

322
00:13:45,982 --> 00:13:49,651
is trying to seduce
Sheldon Cooper.

323
00:13:49,653 --> 00:13:52,821
You done trying to make
yourself feel better?

324
00:13:52,823 --> 00:13:56,207
No. I haven't played
the race card yet.

325
00:13:57,744 --> 00:14:00,829
Hey, I hate to
break up the party,

326
00:14:00,831 --> 00:14:04,499
but Amy says I'm tired
and have to go to bed.

327
00:14:05,685 --> 00:14:07,502
It was nice
seeing everybody.

328
00:14:07,504 --> 00:14:08,686
Thank you for dinner.

329
00:14:08,688 --> 00:14:10,021
Sure.
Our pleasure.

330
00:14:10,023 --> 00:14:12,390
Whatever.

331
00:14:12,392 --> 00:14:14,008
Walk me to my car?

332
00:14:14,010 --> 00:14:15,260
Of course.

333
00:14:15,262 --> 00:14:18,179
We'll all go.

334
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:26,074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

335
00:14:33,446 --> 00:14:35,096
Excuse me.

336
00:14:46,426 --> 00:14:48,593
Pardon. I just need to... yeah.

337
00:14:58,889 --> 00:15:00,221
That was fun.

338
00:15:00,223 --> 00:15:02,440
It was like Mario Kart.

339
00:15:05,445 --> 00:15:07,946
Bye.

340
00:15:07,948 --> 00:15:09,530
We need to talk.

341
00:15:09,532 --> 00:15:11,366
Wh-- Is this about
Leonard and Amy?

342
00:15:11,368 --> 00:15:13,117
I don't like it either.

343
00:15:16,706 --> 00:15:19,107
Okay, I know you don't have a
lot of experience with women,

344
00:15:19,109 --> 00:15:20,575
but Ramona seems to have

345
00:15:20,577 --> 00:15:22,627
a romantic interest in you.

346
00:15:22,629 --> 00:15:24,395
That doesn't make any sense.

347
00:15:24,397 --> 00:15:26,180
She knows I have a girlfriend.

348
00:15:26,182 --> 00:15:28,166
Well, sometimes women
don't care.

349
00:15:28,168 --> 00:15:30,251
Sometimes it makes them
want a guy even more.

350
00:15:30,253 --> 00:15:32,754
That may be true,

351
00:15:32,756 --> 00:15:35,173
but Dr. Nowitzki's
just a friend.

352
00:15:35,175 --> 00:15:37,592
In fact, I wouldn't have
even noticed she's a woman

353
00:15:37,594 --> 00:15:41,095
if she hadn't worn that bathing
suit that highlighted her bosom.

354
00:15:44,117 --> 00:15:46,150
Okay. Um...
...let's try this.

355
00:15:46,152 --> 00:15:48,152
Think of yourself
as one of those

356
00:15:48,154 --> 00:15:50,738
limited edition toys
people like to collect.

357
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:53,775
I already do.

358
00:15:54,861 --> 00:15:56,861
Well, then you get it.

359
00:15:56,863 --> 00:15:59,280
Because there's
only one of me,

360
00:15:59,282 --> 00:16:00,832
I'm more valuable.

361
00:16:00,834 --> 00:16:02,333
Right.

362
00:16:02,335 --> 00:16:04,369
Although, Amy's
already taken me

363
00:16:04,371 --> 00:16:07,538
out of my package
and played with me.

364
00:16:10,927 --> 00:16:12,944
Let's forget the toy thing,
okay?

365
00:16:12,946 --> 00:16:15,930
Um, maybe...
Penny, look. I appreciate your concern,

366
00:16:15,932 --> 00:16:18,299
but I don't think
that's what's happening.

367
00:16:18,301 --> 00:16:21,102
All right. What do
you think is happening?

368
00:16:21,104 --> 00:16:24,222
I think Dr. Nowitzki is
a friendly colleague.

369
00:16:24,224 --> 00:16:28,192
I think you and Leonard need
to see a marriage counselor.

370
00:16:29,529 --> 00:16:31,396
And I need to
update my r?sum?

371
00:16:31,398 --> 00:16:33,648
to include swimming
as a special skill.

372
00:16:41,541 --> 00:16:44,492
Don't look at me
like that, I tried.

373
00:16:49,736 --> 00:16:51,853
Hey, did you eat yet?

374
00:16:51,855 --> 00:16:53,805
Uh, breakfast yes, lunch no.

375
00:16:53,807 --> 00:16:55,490
I did have a cough drop,

376
00:16:55,492 --> 00:16:59,110
but that really rides the
line between sucking and eating.

377
00:16:59,946 --> 00:17:01,746
Well, perfect.
I made us sandwiches.

378
00:17:01,748 --> 00:17:03,531
How thoughtful.

379
00:17:03,533 --> 00:17:04,699
Thank you.

380
00:17:04,701 --> 00:17:05,833
Mmm. No big deal,

381
00:17:05,835 --> 00:17:07,619
I enjoy spending time with you.

382
00:17:07,621 --> 00:17:09,370
And I with you.

383
00:17:09,372 --> 00:17:11,623
Question:

384
00:17:11,625 --> 00:17:15,376
are you seeking a romantic
relationship with me?

385
00:17:16,263 --> 00:17:17,929
What if I were?

386
00:17:17,931 --> 00:17:21,349
Well, that would raise
a number of problems.

387
00:17:21,351 --> 00:17:22,550
We're colleagues.

388
00:17:22,552 --> 00:17:24,102
I'm currently
in a relation...

389
00:17:31,978 --> 00:17:34,612
Excuse me a moment.

390
00:18:33,957 --> 00:18:34,956
Amy.

391
00:18:34,958 --> 00:18:35,973
Amy.

392
00:18:35,975 --> 00:18:37,842
Amy.

393
00:18:55,224 --> 00:18:57,141
Will you marry me?
