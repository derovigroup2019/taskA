1
00:00:00,027 --> 00:00:01,544
<i>Previously on</i>
The Big Bang Theory...

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:04,165
What's this?
Oh, nothing,

3
00:00:04,167 --> 00:00:05,133
just some math we don't need.

4
00:00:05,135 --> 00:00:06,635
This is a different approach.

5
00:00:06,637 --> 00:00:09,537
You trying to get the
guidance system even smaller?

6
00:00:09,539 --> 00:00:11,439
It's just a... theory.

7
00:00:11,441 --> 00:00:13,141
Well, it's not even worked out.

8
00:00:13,143 --> 00:00:15,377
Oh.
(chuckles)

9
00:00:15,379 --> 00:00:17,145
I want this.

10
00:00:18,148 --> 00:00:21,082
Uh, but we've already met
the agreed upon specs.

11
00:00:21,084 --> 00:00:22,951
Going smaller
would require

12
00:00:22,953 --> 00:00:25,020
weeks' worth
of new computations.

13
00:00:25,022 --> 00:00:28,323
So get the kid
with the two shirts to do it.

14
00:00:29,726 --> 00:00:31,359
Sir, I mean, (stammers)
if I may,

15
00:00:31,361 --> 00:00:33,561
uh, we've put a lot
of thought and effort

16
00:00:33,563 --> 00:00:35,797
into this current prototype.

17
00:00:35,799 --> 00:00:36,865
It's a really
elegant solution,

18
00:00:36,867 --> 00:00:39,167
and most
importantly, it works.

19
00:00:39,169 --> 00:00:40,935
You both make excellent points.

20
00:00:40,937 --> 00:00:42,737
And thank you for presenting
it so articulately.

21
00:00:42,739 --> 00:00:44,939
(chuckles) Make this.

22
00:00:47,811 --> 00:00:49,277
Champagne,

23
00:00:49,279 --> 00:00:50,712
champagne,
Thank you.

24
00:00:50,714 --> 00:00:53,515
and for the world's tallest
second grader, apple juice.

25
00:00:54,918 --> 00:00:58,153
No bendy straw, some party.

26
00:00:59,222 --> 00:01:00,388
Hey, a-a toast.

27
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:01,756
Thank you all for
your support

28
00:01:01,758 --> 00:01:03,858
while we worked on our
Air Force project.

29
00:01:03,860 --> 00:01:04,826
And please know that

30
00:01:04,828 --> 00:01:06,094
we could not have
done it without you,

31
00:01:06,096 --> 00:01:06,995
so cheers.

32
00:01:06,997 --> 00:01:08,363
ALL: Cheers.
(whoops)

33
00:01:08,365 --> 00:01:09,964
You know, it's nice of
you to acknowledge us,

34
00:01:09,966 --> 00:01:11,733
but this is your
accomplishment.

35
00:01:11,735 --> 00:01:13,935
Yeah, you guys did
this all on your own.

36
00:01:13,937 --> 00:01:15,637
Without me.

37
00:01:17,307 --> 00:01:18,707
To success without Raj.

38
00:01:18,709 --> 00:01:19,941
(all cheer)

39
00:01:20,777 --> 00:01:21,910
So what happens next?

40
00:01:21,912 --> 00:01:22,944
Phase two,

41
00:01:22,946 --> 00:01:24,079
we test it,
perfect it,

42
00:01:24,081 --> 00:01:25,914
and hope to live long
enough to see the movie

43
00:01:25,916 --> 00:01:27,882
based on our lives starring
more attractive versions of us.

44
00:01:27,884 --> 00:01:29,150
(all chuckle)

45
00:01:29,152 --> 00:01:31,119
Yeah, I'll definitely
live long enough--

46
00:01:31,121 --> 00:01:32,454
vitamin C.

47
00:01:33,490 --> 00:01:35,390
First thing tomorrow
morning, we're back at it.

48
00:01:35,392 --> 00:01:37,492
Without me.

49
00:01:37,494 --> 00:01:39,594
I hope his character doesn't
make it into the movie;

50
00:01:39,596 --> 00:01:41,763
he's kind of a bummer.

51
00:01:44,067 --> 00:01:46,167

52
00:01:46,169 --> 00:01:47,802
Access granted.

53
00:01:47,804 --> 00:01:50,105
Hmm. I don't care if this
thing's burning out my retinas;

54
00:01:50,107 --> 00:01:51,773
it makes me feel special.

55
00:01:53,210 --> 00:01:55,210
Now, before we field test,
I think we...

56
00:01:58,081 --> 00:01:59,981
What the hell?

57
00:01:59,983 --> 00:02:00,949
Where is everything?

58
00:02:00,951 --> 00:02:02,951
Who else has access
to this room?

59
00:02:02,953 --> 00:02:05,253
It's a secure lab
in a classified facility;

60
00:02:05,255 --> 00:02:07,155
only the U.S. government and us.

61
00:02:07,157 --> 00:02:09,157
This is very disconcerting.

62
00:02:10,026 --> 00:02:12,761
But the movie did just get good.

63
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:17,398
? Our whole universe
was in a hot, dense state ?

64
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:20,735
? Then nearly 14 billion years
ago expansion started... Wait! ?

65
00:02:20,737 --> 00:02:22,370
? The Earth began to cool ?

66
00:02:22,372 --> 00:02:24,906
? The autotrophs began to drool,
Neanderthals developed tools ?

67
00:02:24,908 --> 00:02:27,575
? We built the Wall ?
? <i>We built the pyramids</i> ?

68
00:02:27,577 --> 00:02:30,245
? Math, Science, History,
unraveling the mystery ?

69
00:02:30,247 --> 00:02:32,147
? That all started
with a big bang ?

70
00:02:32,149 --> 00:02:32,649
? <i>Bang!</i> ?

Sir, I-I-I'm sorry
but I just don't get it.

74
00:02:41,468 --> 00:02:43,268
Y-You came into our lab

75
00:02:43,270 --> 00:02:45,337
in the middle of the night
and took our prototype

76
00:02:45,339 --> 00:02:47,372
and all of our research
and didn't even tell us?

77
00:02:47,374 --> 00:02:50,342
Sounds like you get it.

78
00:02:50,344 --> 00:02:53,478
Well, why would
you do that?

79
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:55,981
You guys completed phase one,
we'll take it from here.

80
00:02:55,983 --> 00:02:58,049
Where did
you move it?

81
00:02:58,051 --> 00:02:59,217
I can't tell you that.

82
00:02:59,219 --> 00:03:01,686
Are you implementing phase two?

83
00:03:01,688 --> 00:03:02,854
I can't tell you that.

84
00:03:02,856 --> 00:03:04,790
Wait, so you're just
going to take all the work

85
00:03:04,792 --> 00:03:07,759
we've done for the last
year and toss us aside?

86
00:03:07,761 --> 00:03:11,163
That one I can tell you, yes.

87
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,599
This is
all very upsetting.

88
00:03:14,601 --> 00:03:15,734
I'm sorry to hear that.

89
00:03:15,736 --> 00:03:17,169
As you know,

90
00:03:17,171 --> 00:03:19,304
the primary focus of
the United States military

91
00:03:19,306 --> 00:03:21,373
is people's feelings.

92
00:03:22,776 --> 00:03:26,211
If that's sarcasm,
please save it for our enemies.

93
00:03:28,882 --> 00:03:30,315
Well, I may be
moving out soon.

94
00:03:30,317 --> 00:03:31,983
I think I found
a place to live.

95
00:03:31,985 --> 00:03:33,618
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

96
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:34,686
Really?

97
00:03:34,688 --> 00:03:37,222
You kept sending me
apartment listings.

98
00:03:39,359 --> 00:03:41,193
Um... well, I...

99
00:03:41,195 --> 00:03:43,061
yeah, you got me.

100
00:03:44,131 --> 00:03:45,497
Where are you moving?

101
00:03:45,499 --> 00:03:47,866
And when? But a-also where?

102
00:03:47,868 --> 00:03:50,936
Bert has a room for rent.

103
00:03:50,938 --> 00:03:52,404
So you're gonna be
roommates with Bert?

104
00:03:52,406 --> 00:03:54,372
Uh, no, it's, uh,
pretty private, actually,

105
00:03:54,374 --> 00:03:55,740
it's over his garage.

106
00:03:55,742 --> 00:03:58,210
So the only time I'll see him
is when he pulls his car in,

107
00:03:58,212 --> 00:04:01,513
does his laundry or practices
drums in my dining room.

108
00:04:02,783 --> 00:04:03,915
Well, good for you.
Mm-hmm.

109
00:04:03,917 --> 00:04:05,851
I actually have
a little news myself.

110
00:04:05,853 --> 00:04:07,819
Okay, we're just gonna circle
back to when he's moving out?

111
00:04:07,821 --> 00:04:08,954
Okay, that's cool.

112
00:04:10,591 --> 00:04:12,157
I was, uh, asked to be
a visiting researcher

113
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:13,492
at Princeton.

114
00:04:13,494 --> 00:04:15,494
- Hey, that's amazing.
- Good for you. - Congratulations.

115
00:04:15,496 --> 00:04:17,395
Thanks, but the thing is
I'll be gone for a few months

116
00:04:17,397 --> 00:04:19,130
and I don't know how Sheldon's
gonna feel about that.

117
00:04:19,132 --> 00:04:21,566
Oh, come on, he's a grown man,
he can take care of himself.

118
00:04:21,568 --> 00:04:24,536
You really believe that?

119
00:04:25,405 --> 00:04:27,739
Once again, you got me.

120
00:04:30,544 --> 00:04:32,878
How can you work
on something for a year

121
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,279
and they just take it?

122
00:04:34,281 --> 00:04:36,748
I can't believe the Air Force
would treat us like that.

123
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:39,718
You know, I have a good mind
to stop paying my taxes.

124
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:43,488
It's too bad I enjoy
doing them so much.

125
00:04:47,561 --> 00:04:50,061
The Air Force did it again.

126
00:04:50,063 --> 00:04:52,631
They're erasing our lives!

127
00:04:54,067 --> 00:04:56,635
Third floor,
wrong apartment.

128
00:04:58,272 --> 00:05:00,138
Although, if anyone's gonna
clean out your apartment

129
00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:03,275
and disappear,
it'd be Penny.

130
00:05:03,277 --> 00:05:04,409
She might disappear,

131
00:05:04,411 --> 00:05:06,278
but she's definitely
not cleaning anything.

132
00:05:12,586 --> 00:05:14,119
It's okay, everything's here.

133
00:05:15,455 --> 00:05:16,555
Oh, hey,
what's going on?

134
00:05:16,557 --> 00:05:17,489
You won't believe it;

135
00:05:17,491 --> 00:05:19,724
the military
confiscated our project.

136
00:05:19,726 --> 00:05:20,859
What?
You're kidding.

137
00:05:20,861 --> 00:05:21,993
Why would they do that?

138
00:05:21,995 --> 00:05:23,962
They wouldn't say.

139
00:05:23,964 --> 00:05:25,397
I feel so betrayed.

140
00:05:25,399 --> 00:05:27,699
You know, all my life I thought
Uncle Sam was a friendly uncle

141
00:05:27,701 --> 00:05:28,867
who brought you presents.

142
00:05:28,869 --> 00:05:31,970
Turns out he's
the other kind.

143
00:05:33,273 --> 00:05:34,472
Sheldon, I'm so sorry.

144
00:05:34,474 --> 00:05:36,942
Thank you. Can we just
talk about something else?

145
00:05:36,944 --> 00:05:38,310
Yeah, what's going on
with you guys?

146
00:05:38,312 --> 00:05:39,945
Give us some good news.

147
00:05:39,947 --> 00:05:41,680
Amy's got some news.

148
00:05:45,819 --> 00:05:48,687
Yeah, um...

149
00:05:48,689 --> 00:05:50,889
Raj is moving out.

150
00:05:51,992 --> 00:05:53,391
Oh, no.

151
00:05:53,393 --> 00:05:55,527
(sternly):
When?

152
00:05:59,266 --> 00:06:00,365
You doing okay?

153
00:06:00,367 --> 00:06:01,866
Not really.
(chuckles)

154
00:06:01,868 --> 00:06:04,235
Want me to put on
some Neil Diamond?

155
00:06:04,237 --> 00:06:06,438
That always makes
you feel better.

156
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:07,806
No.

157
00:06:07,808 --> 00:06:11,009
Then you'll get all sexed up
and I'm not in the mood.

158
00:06:12,579 --> 00:06:14,846
I mean, an entire
year wasted.

159
00:06:14,848 --> 00:06:18,149
You might be forgetting another
accomplishment of the past year.

160
00:06:18,151 --> 00:06:21,853
Oh. Yeah, yeah, we brought
life into the world.

161
00:06:22,589 --> 00:06:23,989
Really?

162
00:06:23,991 --> 00:06:26,524
That's the importance
you put on us having a baby?

163
00:06:26,526 --> 00:06:28,793
I'm happy about it, but, I mean,
it's not like I did much.

164
00:06:28,795 --> 00:06:30,161
I mean, after
the first three minutes

165
00:06:30,163 --> 00:06:32,764
it was pretty much all you.

166
00:06:35,769 --> 00:06:38,103
So, did you tell him
about Princeton yet?

167
00:06:38,105 --> 00:06:40,171
No, I'm waiting till
he's in a good mood.

168
00:06:40,173 --> 00:06:43,675
Oh, sweetie,
you might not live that long.

169
00:06:44,878 --> 00:06:46,611
I don't know,
maybe I shouldn't go.

170
00:06:46,613 --> 00:06:48,480
Oh, stop it, he'll be fine.

171
00:06:48,482 --> 00:06:50,849
I guess. And he'll have you and
Leonard right across the hall

172
00:06:50,851 --> 00:06:52,183
the whole time.

173
00:06:52,185 --> 00:06:54,986
Oh, damn, wait, you know,
maybe you shouldn't go...

174
00:06:54,988 --> 00:06:56,421
Got to go.

175
00:06:57,057 --> 00:06:58,223
Morning.

176
00:06:59,393 --> 00:07:03,628
I apologize for exceeding
my allotted bathroom time.

177
00:07:03,630 --> 00:07:04,796
Are you feeling okay?

178
00:07:04,798 --> 00:07:06,197
Not really.

179
00:07:06,199 --> 00:07:10,635
Apparently grief can
make one less regular.

180
00:07:10,637 --> 00:07:13,238
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

181
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:16,608
No, I sat and I sat,
but to no avail.

182
00:07:17,511 --> 00:07:20,779
Oh, the-the more details,
the more sorry.

183
00:07:22,416 --> 00:07:24,115
Well, maybe this'll
cheer you up.

184
00:07:24,117 --> 00:07:26,051
I made your favorite oatmeal...

185
00:07:26,053 --> 00:07:28,453
plain.

186
00:07:29,356 --> 00:07:30,955
What's the occasion?

187
00:07:30,957 --> 00:07:34,759
No occasion, I just wanted
to do something nice for you.

188
00:07:34,761 --> 00:07:37,162
You're so kind.

189
00:07:37,164 --> 00:07:39,431
You know, I don't know how
I ever got by without you.

190
00:07:40,934 --> 00:07:42,367
Oh.

191
00:07:42,369 --> 00:07:45,270
That's sweet, but you...
you did just fine on your own.

192
00:07:46,073 --> 00:07:47,472
Well, I thought that, too,

193
00:07:47,474 --> 00:07:50,575
but I've come to realize, I am
completely dependent on you.

194
00:07:52,446 --> 00:07:54,713
Sheldon, you're,
you're being silly.

195
00:07:54,715 --> 00:07:58,349
No, to wake up every morning
and know you're there

196
00:07:58,351 --> 00:08:00,251
is a great comfort to me.

197
00:08:01,521 --> 00:08:05,223
Mmm, tasteless.

198
00:08:08,862 --> 00:08:11,196
How do you do it?

199
00:08:12,799 --> 00:08:14,332
You know, what you need to do is

200
00:08:14,334 --> 00:08:15,834
put this Air Force
project behind you

201
00:08:15,836 --> 00:08:17,335
and just dive
into something new.

202
00:08:17,337 --> 00:08:20,939
Well, there is our
quantum cognition experiment.

203
00:08:20,941 --> 00:08:23,475
You and I could spend
more time on that.

204
00:08:23,477 --> 00:08:25,510
Oh, I don't know,

205
00:08:25,512 --> 00:08:27,912
I mean, let's say
we succeed in proving

206
00:08:27,914 --> 00:08:29,314
that our consciousness
creates reality.

207
00:08:29,316 --> 00:08:30,982
I mean, what will we have
really accomplished?

208
00:08:30,984 --> 00:08:34,252
You know, a loaf of bread's
still three bucks.

209
00:08:35,122 --> 00:08:36,721
I'm confused.

210
00:08:36,723 --> 00:08:39,224
You're always saying that you
want to spend more time with me.

211
00:08:39,226 --> 00:08:41,593
That is true, I have said that.

212
00:08:41,595 --> 00:08:43,762
Well, a lot, it's very annoying.

213
00:08:45,165 --> 00:08:47,298
Has something changed?

214
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:49,768
Um, is there something
that you're not telling me?

215
00:08:53,073 --> 00:08:57,008
I was offered a summer research
fellowship at Princeton.

216
00:08:59,079 --> 00:09:00,612
Princeton?

217
00:09:00,614 --> 00:09:02,881
A fine institution.

218
00:09:04,184 --> 00:09:06,151
The place where
Albert Einstein taught.

219
00:09:06,153 --> 00:09:08,319
And where Leonard got his PhD,

220
00:09:08,321 --> 00:09:11,089
so it may have gone downhill.

221
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:14,993
Yeah, that's the one.

222
00:09:14,995 --> 00:09:17,762
Well, that's wonderful.

223
00:09:17,764 --> 00:09:19,130
Congratulations.

224
00:09:19,132 --> 00:09:20,598
Well, I-I haven't
accepted it yet.

225
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:22,433
I wanted to talk
to you first.

226
00:09:22,435 --> 00:09:23,601
Wh-What is there to talk about?

227
00:09:23,603 --> 00:09:25,236
You have to take it.
It's important.

228
00:09:25,238 --> 00:09:27,038
So are you.

229
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:28,239
Thank you, but I'll be fine.

230
00:09:28,241 --> 00:09:29,707
Are-are you sure?

231
00:09:29,709 --> 00:09:34,145
Yes. I may have lost my guidance
system and my girlfriend,

232
00:09:34,147 --> 00:09:36,314
but I still have a colon
full of yesterday's meals

233
00:09:36,316 --> 00:09:38,416
to keep me company.

234
00:09:41,454 --> 00:09:42,821
Although, thanks to your
high-fiber breakfast,

235
00:09:42,823 --> 00:09:44,223
I'm sure that'll be
leaving me, too.

236
00:09:48,907 --> 00:09:50,087
Really?

237
00:09:50,088 --> 00:09:51,954
He doesn't put raisins
or banana slices

238
00:09:51,956 --> 00:09:54,424
or anything in it?

239
00:09:54,942 --> 00:09:58,410
I don't think plain oatmeal
was the point of that story.

240
00:09:58,412 --> 00:09:59,911
I mean, I like a
little brown sugar...

241
00:09:59,913 --> 00:10:03,348
Guys.

242
00:10:03,350 --> 00:10:04,916
You're still
gonna go, right?

243
00:10:04,918 --> 00:10:05,884
I don't know.

244
00:10:05,886 --> 00:10:08,086
Sheldon's so vulnerable
right now.

245
00:10:08,088 --> 00:10:09,688
Oh, come on. Look,
if the roles were reversed,

246
00:10:09,690 --> 00:10:11,489
he'd be on the first train
to New Jersey,

247
00:10:11,491 --> 00:10:14,826
or the second train if there
were teenagers on the first one.

248
00:10:14,828 --> 00:10:17,796
Well, distance
might be nice.

249
00:10:17,798 --> 00:10:19,698
The last time a big project
ended for Howie,

250
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:21,566
he wouldn't stop
following me around.

251
00:10:21,568 --> 00:10:23,568
He even went with me
to get a mammogram.

252
00:10:23,570 --> 00:10:25,237
Well, what's wrong with that?

253
00:10:25,239 --> 00:10:26,972
No, he wanted
to get one with me,

254
00:10:26,974 --> 00:10:30,108
like some kind of weird
couple's massage.

255
00:10:30,110 --> 00:10:32,978
And yet you bore his child.
Neato.

256
00:10:34,982 --> 00:10:37,716
You're excited about
this opportunity, right?

257
00:10:37,718 --> 00:10:39,918
Of course. I get to be part
of the first team

258
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:42,454
to use radon markers
to map the structures that...

259
00:10:42,456 --> 00:10:45,223
Okay, a simple yes will do.

260
00:10:45,225 --> 00:10:46,558
You have to go.

261
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:48,927
I know, but what
if Sheldon...

262
00:10:48,929 --> 00:10:50,762
Okay, listen to me.
Your relationship can handle

263
00:10:50,764 --> 00:10:51,830
being long distance for a while.

264
00:10:51,832 --> 00:10:53,632
It's not like you two
are very physical.

265
00:10:53,634 --> 00:10:56,067
Hey, you don't know what
goes on behind closed doors.

266
00:10:56,069 --> 00:10:57,269
A lot of lectures?

267
00:10:57,271 --> 00:10:58,336
All right, so you know.

268
00:10:59,539 --> 00:11:01,573
I'm telling you,
if you don't go

269
00:11:01,575 --> 00:11:02,707
you'll end up
regretting it.

270
00:11:02,709 --> 00:11:03,708
WOLOWITZ:
Hey!

271
00:11:03,710 --> 00:11:06,144
Wait up!
Oh, great.

272
00:11:08,048 --> 00:11:10,181
You left something at home.

273
00:11:10,183 --> 00:11:11,216
A big hug!
Oh!

274
00:11:11,218 --> 00:11:13,485
(Wolowitz chuckles)

275
00:11:13,487 --> 00:11:15,720
I found it right next
to these kisses.

276
00:11:15,722 --> 00:11:17,355
(Wolowitz smooching)

277
00:11:17,357 --> 00:11:18,657
It's too late for me.

278
00:11:18,659 --> 00:11:20,325
Save yourself.

279
00:11:22,663 --> 00:11:25,430
So, are you excited to have
your own place again?

280
00:11:25,432 --> 00:11:27,899
I am, but I'll miss you guys.

281
00:11:27,901 --> 00:11:29,267
Ah, we'll miss you, too.

282
00:11:29,269 --> 00:11:32,904
Wha... you could try
saying that without smiling.

283
00:11:32,906 --> 00:11:36,374
I'm trying. This is
the best I can do.

284
00:11:36,376 --> 00:11:38,576
(harmonica playing)

285
00:11:45,886 --> 00:11:47,085
What are you doing?

286
00:11:47,087 --> 00:11:49,387
What does it look like?

287
00:11:49,389 --> 00:11:52,090
I'm playing sad harmonica...

288
00:11:52,092 --> 00:11:54,793
in an apartment
as empty as my heart.

289
00:11:54,795 --> 00:11:56,995
Why?

290
00:11:56,997 --> 00:11:59,597
I got the blues.

291
00:11:59,599 --> 00:12:01,733
My baby done left me.

292
00:12:01,735 --> 00:12:04,869
Come on, Sheldon.

293
00:12:04,871 --> 00:12:06,971
Amy's only gone
for a few months.

294
00:12:06,973 --> 00:12:09,507
And now that I'm moving out,
your old room is empty,

295
00:12:09,509 --> 00:12:10,975
so you can stay there
whenever you want.

296
00:12:10,977 --> 00:12:13,778
Uh, could I talk to you
in the hall for a sec?

297
00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:15,113
Yeah, sure.

298
00:12:21,355 --> 00:12:22,654
Sheldon, you're being silly.

299
00:12:22,656 --> 00:12:24,322
Am I?

300
00:12:24,324 --> 00:12:26,391
Yesterday
I had an Air Force project,

301
00:12:26,393 --> 00:12:27,692
a girlfriend who lived with me,

302
00:12:27,694 --> 00:12:30,929
and my good friend Raj
right across the hall.

303
00:12:30,931 --> 00:12:33,264
Do you really care
about that last one?

304
00:12:33,266 --> 00:12:36,601
No, but that list was sounding
a little thin.

305
00:12:36,603 --> 00:12:40,071
Instead of dwelling on the
negative, think about this.

306
00:12:40,073 --> 00:12:43,108
Your girlfriend was given
an amazing opportunity,

307
00:12:43,110 --> 00:12:44,976
which gives you
an opportunity

308
00:12:44,978 --> 00:12:48,279
to show her that you're a loving
and supportive boyfriend.

309
00:12:49,116 --> 00:12:52,250
So trick her.

310
00:12:53,086 --> 00:12:55,954
All right, let me start again.

311
00:12:55,956 --> 00:12:58,423
Uh... you and Amy...

312
00:12:58,425 --> 00:12:59,657
KOOTHRAPPALI:
Can I get my stuff?

313
00:12:59,659 --> 00:13:03,027
Sounds like it's
gonna be a while.

314
00:13:09,102 --> 00:13:11,569
I missed you.
(gasps)

315
00:13:11,571 --> 00:13:13,705
Come here, let's talk.

316
00:13:13,707 --> 00:13:15,974
Ooh. Sounds serious.

317
00:13:15,976 --> 00:13:17,409
Have I been a bad boy?

318
00:13:17,411 --> 00:13:18,443
Am I gonna get a spanking

319
00:13:18,445 --> 00:13:21,413
'cause you know I...
Just listen.

320
00:13:21,415 --> 00:13:23,415
I don't know if
you realize this,

321
00:13:23,417 --> 00:13:26,484
but whenever you're
between projects,

322
00:13:26,486 --> 00:13:28,953
you tend to get a
little insecure.

323
00:13:28,955 --> 00:13:30,522
Oh.
A little clingy.

324
00:13:30,524 --> 00:13:33,057
I know and I'm sorry.

325
00:13:33,059 --> 00:13:35,059
Oh, oh, oh, okay, stop.

326
00:13:35,061 --> 00:13:37,629
Stop.

327
00:13:37,631 --> 00:13:39,564
I love when you're
affectionate,

328
00:13:39,566 --> 00:13:42,000
but this is not coming
from a good place.

329
00:13:42,002 --> 00:13:43,902
(laughing):
Well, excuse me,

330
00:13:43,904 --> 00:13:46,271
but what did you do when you
worked on that allergy drug

331
00:13:46,273 --> 00:13:48,940
for two years and the FDA
shut down your project?

332
00:13:48,942 --> 00:13:53,378
I signed us up for
ballroom dance class.

333
00:13:54,214 --> 00:13:56,514
Okay, and what did you do

334
00:13:56,516 --> 00:13:59,350
when they took you
off the antifungal team?

335
00:13:59,352 --> 00:14:03,388
I made us have a baby.

336
00:14:03,390 --> 00:14:06,591
So?

337
00:14:06,593 --> 00:14:08,426
Bring it in.

338
00:14:08,428 --> 00:14:10,562
(both chuckle)

339
00:14:10,564 --> 00:14:14,566
And now the movie
just got rated "R."

340
00:14:18,104 --> 00:14:19,337
Hey.

341
00:14:19,339 --> 00:14:20,939
You going somewhere?

342
00:14:20,941 --> 00:14:26,277
No, but you are, so I got
you this as a present.

343
00:14:26,279 --> 00:14:28,580
Sheldon, that isn't necessary.

344
00:14:28,582 --> 00:14:29,881
No, it is.

345
00:14:29,883 --> 00:14:31,249
Leonard pointed out to me

346
00:14:31,251 --> 00:14:34,085
that I'm not always a loving
and supportive boyfriend,

347
00:14:34,087 --> 00:14:38,456
so here's some
quality luggage.

348
00:14:38,458 --> 00:14:40,558
Thank you.

349
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:43,361
The salesman said it could
survive a plane crash, so...

350
00:14:45,732 --> 00:14:48,633
Perhaps you should fly
inside it.

351
00:14:52,906 --> 00:14:55,273
Does this mean you're
okay with me going?

352
00:14:55,275 --> 00:14:57,308
Well, I'm not looking
forward to it,

353
00:14:57,310 --> 00:14:59,844
but it is a wonderful
opportunity

354
00:14:59,846 --> 00:15:01,679
and you need to take it.

355
00:15:01,681 --> 00:15:03,882
Besides, Princeton
is in New Jersey,

356
00:15:03,884 --> 00:15:07,318
so it's not like you're
gonna want to stay.

357
00:15:12,859 --> 00:15:15,827
Uh, I know it's
not your birthday,

358
00:15:15,829 --> 00:15:16,794
but if you're
interested...

359
00:15:16,796 --> 00:15:18,429
I am.
Okay.

360
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:22,467
Oh, and just to be clear,

361
00:15:22,469 --> 00:15:26,137
I'm not being intimate with you
in order to keep you from going.

362
00:15:26,139 --> 00:15:28,106
I wasn't thinking that.

363
00:15:28,108 --> 00:15:30,608
Well, no, it's just, I'm
just warning you, you know,

364
00:15:30,610 --> 00:15:33,011
if you find yourself
3,000 miles away

365
00:15:33,013 --> 00:15:35,780
and craving a-a hit
of this, you know...

366
00:15:37,017 --> 00:15:40,051
...I can't Skype it to you.

367
00:15:40,053 --> 00:15:44,455
That's a risk
I'm willing to take.

368
00:15:44,457 --> 00:15:45,990
All right, then.

369
00:15:45,992 --> 00:15:49,994
Let's go to the bedroom,
remove our clothes,

370
00:15:49,996 --> 00:15:51,329
fold them neatly...

371
00:15:52,966 --> 00:15:56,801
...and engage in
frenzied lovemaking.

372
00:15:59,506 --> 00:16:01,973
What if we don't fold
our clothes at all?

373
00:16:01,975 --> 00:16:04,509
I d... or...

374
00:16:04,511 --> 00:16:07,145
what if we fold them?

375
00:16:09,349 --> 00:16:10,648
Well, here's your key back.

376
00:16:10,650 --> 00:16:12,116
Thank you.

377
00:16:12,118 --> 00:16:13,985
As soon as I have the place set
up I'm gonna have you guys over.

378
00:16:13,987 --> 00:16:15,853
Oh, we would love that.

379
00:16:15,855 --> 00:16:17,221
I really can't thank you
enough for taking me in.

380
00:16:17,223 --> 00:16:20,558
You know, I was in a pretty
low place in my life, and...

381
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:24,495
SHELDON: Oh, Amy,
you naughty vixen.

382
00:16:28,501 --> 00:16:32,070
Anyway, uh,
as I was saying,

383
00:16:32,072 --> 00:16:34,839
I was at a pretty low place
in my life and, uh,

384
00:16:34,841 --> 00:16:36,374
if it wasn't for friends
like you...

385
00:16:36,376 --> 00:16:37,842
AMY: My goodness,
that form of stimulation

386
00:16:37,844 --> 00:16:39,043
is highly efficient.

387
00:16:43,583 --> 00:16:45,883
I can't compete
with that. Bye.

388
00:16:48,421 --> 00:16:50,188
Should we give them
their privacy?

389
00:16:50,190 --> 00:16:53,891
I want to,
but I don't think I can.

390
00:16:53,893 --> 00:16:55,860
SHELDON: Whoopee!
Okay, I'm good now.

391
00:17:02,325 --> 00:17:03,958
Okay, the car is waiting.

392
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:05,560
Do you want
to walk me downstairs?

393
00:17:05,562 --> 00:17:06,661
Of course.

394
00:17:06,663 --> 00:17:08,296
Here, here, let me.

395
00:17:08,298 --> 00:17:10,565
I've been doing a little
research on New Jersey,

396
00:17:10,567 --> 00:17:12,133
and I was delighted to learn

397
00:17:12,135 --> 00:17:14,369
that their chief
agricultural product

398
00:17:14,371 --> 00:17:16,204
is sod.

399
00:17:16,206 --> 00:17:18,706
- Is it?
- Hmm, yes.

400
00:17:18,708 --> 00:17:23,745
Yeah, perhaps I've been harder
on them than they deserve.

401
00:17:23,747 --> 00:17:25,780
Do you think it's possible

402
00:17:25,782 --> 00:17:29,050
you might enjoy being
on your own for a little while?

403
00:17:29,052 --> 00:17:30,785
It's hard to say.

404
00:17:30,787 --> 00:17:32,787
I've never really lived
by myself.

405
00:17:32,789 --> 00:17:36,257
What if I become
strange and eccentric?

406
00:17:40,897 --> 00:17:42,597
I'll love you no matter what.

407
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:48,002
Howard Hughes saved his
urine in milk bottles.

408
00:17:49,906 --> 00:17:53,307
We'll cross that bridge
when we come to it.

409
00:17:53,309 --> 00:17:56,004
And you'll text me when
you arrive at the airport?

410
00:17:56,028 --> 00:17:56,845
I will.

411
00:17:56,846 --> 00:17:58,579
- And when you're at the gate?
- Uh-huh.

412
00:17:58,581 --> 00:18:00,281
And if you see any actors
from <i>Game of Thrones</i>

413
00:18:00,283 --> 00:18:02,316
in first class?

414
00:18:02,318 --> 00:18:04,402
I don't know what they
look like, but sure.

415
00:18:04,426 --> 00:18:04,987
Oh.

416
00:18:04,988 --> 00:18:06,983
And don't forget to Skype
me when you arrive.

417
00:18:07,007 --> 00:18:07,623
I won't.

418
00:18:07,624 --> 00:18:09,023
- And every morning.
- Got it.

419
00:18:09,025 --> 00:18:11,259
Now of course, my
9:00 a.m. is your noon,

420
00:18:11,261 --> 00:18:12,827
so let's avoid the
whole "good morning,"

421
00:18:12,829 --> 00:18:13,928
"good afternoon" minefield,

422
00:18:13,930 --> 00:18:15,763
and let's just say,
"Hello."

423
00:18:15,765 --> 00:18:17,698
Good thinking.

424
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:19,767
And just remember,
I am proud of you

425
00:18:19,769 --> 00:18:22,870
and I support you
in all that you do.

426
00:18:22,872 --> 00:18:24,639
Thank you.
That means a lot.

427
00:18:24,641 --> 00:18:25,907
Oh, and one last thing.

428
00:18:25,909 --> 00:18:28,376
If you find yourself working
with a male scientist

429
00:18:28,378 --> 00:18:32,447
who's as smart as me, as tall
as me and has hair like Thor,

430
00:18:32,449 --> 00:18:35,016
well, then I want you to
step away from the situation

431
00:18:35,018 --> 00:18:36,018
and call me immediately.

432
00:18:37,852 --> 00:18:44,652
