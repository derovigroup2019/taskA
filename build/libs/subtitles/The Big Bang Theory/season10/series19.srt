1
00:00:03,164 --> 00:00:05,464
You know,
downward-facing dog

2
00:00:05,466 --> 00:00:09,669
comes from the Sanskrit phrase
<i>adho mukha shvanasana.</i>

3
00:00:09,671 --> 00:00:11,704
Oh, that's beautiful.
What does it mean?

4
00:00:11,706 --> 00:00:14,273
"Downward-facing dog."

5
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:16,909
Yeah, I guess they
don't have Sanskrit

6
00:00:16,911 --> 00:00:19,712
for "butts up and heads down."

7
00:00:19,714 --> 00:00:21,214
Hey, we wrote the <i>Kama Sutra.</i>

8
00:00:21,216 --> 00:00:23,783
If it involves butts,
there's a word for it.

9
00:00:24,819 --> 00:00:27,119
I thought we were getting
breakfast before work.

10
00:00:27,121 --> 00:00:28,654
Oh, right, sorry.

11
00:00:28,656 --> 00:00:30,656
It's my fault. I asked
Penny to do yoga with me.

12
00:00:30,658 --> 00:00:32,758
If you want, I can get
ready in five minutes.

13
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:34,861
(chuckles)
It's cute that you think that.

14
00:00:34,863 --> 00:00:37,163
Don't worry about it.

15
00:00:37,165 --> 00:00:38,164
Hey, can I ask you a favor?

16
00:00:38,166 --> 00:00:39,532
Would you mind taking
Cinnamon for a walk?

17
00:00:39,534 --> 00:00:41,400
Sure.
You're living here for free.

18
00:00:41,402 --> 00:00:42,668
I guess I owe you.

19
00:00:44,405 --> 00:00:46,372
Bye, Cinnamon.
Be a good girl.

20
00:00:46,374 --> 00:00:48,241
Yeah, bye, sweetie!
Bye!

21
00:00:48,243 --> 00:00:49,942
Yeah, yeah, bye, Leonard.
(chuckles)

22
00:00:51,145 --> 00:00:55,314
Okay, and tree pose.

23
00:00:57,085 --> 00:01:00,152
Well, she's done.

24
00:01:01,222 --> 00:01:04,824
? Our whole universe
was in a hot, dense state ?

25
00:01:04,826 --> 00:01:08,160
? Then nearly 14 billion years
ago expansion started... Wait! ?

26
00:01:08,162 --> 00:01:09,795
? The Earth began to cool ?

27
00:01:09,797 --> 00:01:12,331
? The autotrophs began to drool,
Neanderthals developed tools ?

28
00:01:12,333 --> 00:01:15,001
? We built the Wall ?
? <i>We built the pyramids</i> ?

29
00:01:15,003 --> 00:01:17,670
? Math, Science, History,
unraveling the mystery ?

30
00:01:17,672 --> 00:01:19,572
? That all started
with a big bang ?

31
00:01:19,574 --> 00:01:20,892
? <i>Bang!</i> ?

34
00:01:30,419 --> 00:01:32,385
Things have been going
really well

35
00:01:32,387 --> 00:01:34,588
with the infinite
resistance gyroscope.

36
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:36,523
That's great. How so?

37
00:01:36,525 --> 00:01:38,058
Oh, the project is classified.

38
00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:39,159
I can't tell you.

39
00:01:39,161 --> 00:01:43,330
Oh, I suppose I could redact
the classified parts.

40
00:01:43,332 --> 00:01:47,267
All right, um, I came up
with an elegant solution

41
00:01:47,269 --> 00:01:50,637
to the... (speaks indistinctly)
(horn honks)

42
00:01:50,639 --> 00:01:51,871
I used the...

43
00:01:51,873 --> 00:01:53,840
(speaks indistinctly)
(horn honks)

44
00:01:53,842 --> 00:01:57,110
And then I... (speaking indistinctly)
(horn honking)

45
00:02:00,015 --> 00:02:01,781
And that did it.

46
00:02:01,783 --> 00:02:04,184
(horn honking)

47
00:02:04,186 --> 00:02:06,686
Wow, I wonder
what they're redacting.

48
00:02:07,990 --> 00:02:10,223
Why don't you ask me
what I'm working on?

49
00:02:10,225 --> 00:02:13,360
Oh, very well.
What have you been working on?

50
00:02:13,362 --> 00:02:15,729
And feel free to honk
during the boring parts.

51
00:02:16,565 --> 00:02:18,298
I'm doing some experiments
to show

52
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:20,133
that the signal
to move a muscle occurs

53
00:02:20,135 --> 00:02:22,269
before you know
you even decided to move it.

54
00:02:22,271 --> 00:02:24,638
W... So you're attempting
to pinpoint

55
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:27,340
where consciousness resides
in the brain.

56
00:02:27,342 --> 00:02:29,676
Yes, I'm trying to figure out
the nanometer

57
00:02:29,678 --> 00:02:32,112
and the attosecond,
precisely where and when

58
00:02:32,114 --> 00:02:33,880
an event of awareness
takes place.

59
00:02:33,882 --> 00:02:36,416
Well, what do you know?

60
00:02:36,418 --> 00:02:38,918
Here I was, waiting
to be bored with biology,

61
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:41,788
and instead you tickle
my intellectual fancy.

62
00:02:41,790 --> 00:02:45,292
Which, unlike my body,
is an okay place to tickle.

63
00:02:46,762 --> 00:02:48,194
You know, when I was six,

64
00:02:48,196 --> 00:02:50,964
I wanted to marry the gorilla
from <i>Good Night, Gorilla.</i>

65
00:02:52,267 --> 00:02:53,867
Maybe I was onto something.

66
00:02:56,305 --> 00:02:59,339
Gentlemen,
the most interesting thing

67
00:02:59,341 --> 00:03:01,074
just happened with this spoon.

68
00:03:01,076 --> 00:03:03,977
Unless it was singing
"Be Our Guest," I doubt it.

69
00:03:06,048 --> 00:03:08,014
Yeah, I picked it up
without thinking about it.

70
00:03:08,016 --> 00:03:10,216
Which raises a
neuroscientific question,

71
00:03:10,218 --> 00:03:12,519
when did I decide
to pick it up?

72
00:03:12,521 --> 00:03:14,921
The bigger question is, what are
you gonna eat with that spoon?

73
00:03:14,923 --> 00:03:17,357
You didn't get any food.

74
00:03:18,193 --> 00:03:20,260
He does raise
an interesting point.

75
00:03:20,262 --> 00:03:23,830
Amy is studying the time lag
between intent and awareness,

76
00:03:23,832 --> 00:03:25,231
and I realized
that applies

77
00:03:25,233 --> 00:03:27,367
to the measurement problem
in quantum mechanics.

78
00:03:27,369 --> 00:03:29,769
Now, I recognize there
will be a time lag

79
00:03:29,771 --> 00:03:32,038
between me saying that and
you Googling what it means,

80
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:33,273
so I'll wait.

81
00:03:34,509 --> 00:03:36,376
I understand it, Sheldon.

82
00:03:36,378 --> 00:03:38,011
Yeah, me, too.

83
00:03:38,013 --> 00:03:39,145
I'm sorry, I spaced.

84
00:03:39,147 --> 00:03:41,614
Are we still talking
about the spoon?

85
00:03:42,551 --> 00:03:44,284
It's nice to see you
taking an interest

86
00:03:44,286 --> 00:03:45,352
in Amy's work.

87
00:03:45,354 --> 00:03:46,619
Well, don't get me wrong.

88
00:03:46,621 --> 00:03:48,555
Neurobiology's nothing more
than the science

89
00:03:48,557 --> 00:03:49,889
of gray squishy stuff.

90
00:03:49,891 --> 00:03:51,958
But, you know,
when it connects to physics,

91
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:54,627
gas up the Ford, Martha,
we're going for a drive.

92
00:03:58,166 --> 00:04:00,100
So did you
confront Jennifer?

93
00:04:00,102 --> 00:04:01,634
I was going to,
but she called in sick.

94
00:04:01,636 --> 00:04:03,303
And guess who else
called in sick.

95
00:04:03,305 --> 00:04:04,537
Paul.
Paul.

96
00:04:04,539 --> 00:04:06,272
Who's Paul?

97
00:04:06,274 --> 00:04:08,274
Oh, you met him at the
office Christmas party.

98
00:04:08,276 --> 00:04:09,142
He's married to Nancy.

99
00:04:09,144 --> 00:04:11,945
Oh, sure.
Wait, Nancy?

100
00:04:11,947 --> 00:04:13,947
I bet Jennifer gets
a promotion out of this,

101
00:04:13,949 --> 00:04:16,449
which is so unfair because I
work twice as hard as she does.

102
00:04:16,451 --> 00:04:18,118
Don't worry,
Jerry won't be fooled

103
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:20,353
by that type of behavior.

104
00:04:23,658 --> 00:04:25,892
Jerry?

105
00:04:25,894 --> 00:04:28,928
It didn't work for Randy,
it didn't work for Tina,

106
00:04:28,930 --> 00:04:30,830
it sure as hell isn't
gonna work for Jennifer.

107
00:04:30,832 --> 00:04:33,032
Well, I hope not.
I just hate when

108
00:04:33,034 --> 00:04:34,734
people play
those kinds of games.

109
00:04:36,004 --> 00:04:37,337
Tina?

110
00:04:37,339 --> 00:04:40,407
With your sales record,
you have nothing to worry about.

111
00:04:40,409 --> 00:04:42,108
Mm.

112
00:04:42,110 --> 00:04:45,879
I went to your office
Christmas party?

113
00:04:48,683 --> 00:04:51,518
You know, I like harp lessons,

114
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:54,954
but I'm thinking of switching
to elevator repair lessons.

115
00:04:56,691 --> 00:04:57,624
What are you working on?

116
00:04:57,626 --> 00:05:00,326
I was thinking about
your experiment

117
00:05:00,328 --> 00:05:02,262
on the neuroscience
of decision making,

118
00:05:02,264 --> 00:05:03,596
and I realized,

119
00:05:03,598 --> 00:05:05,632
if we connect it
to the measurement problem

120
00:05:05,634 --> 00:05:07,600
in quantum mechanics,
we have a chance

121
00:05:07,602 --> 00:05:09,235
to disprove the role
of consciousness

122
00:05:09,237 --> 00:05:11,171
in the Copenhagen
Interpretation.

123
00:05:11,173 --> 00:05:14,507
Wait, are you saying if
we combine my experiment

124
00:05:14,509 --> 00:05:15,708
with your calculations,

125
00:05:15,710 --> 00:05:17,777
we can determine
the precise moment in time

126
00:05:17,779 --> 00:05:19,646
when the wave function
collapses?

127
00:05:19,648 --> 00:05:21,481
It could be the most
inspired combination

128
00:05:21,483 --> 00:05:23,550
since I mixed red Icee
into my blue Icee.

129
00:05:26,621 --> 00:05:28,755
It was like drinking
2/7 of the rainbow.

130
00:05:30,725 --> 00:05:32,025
Sheldon, this is
really interesting.

131
00:05:32,027 --> 00:05:35,328
Yeah, and this one won't
stain my teeth purple.

132
00:05:35,330 --> 00:05:37,130
You know, we've never
collaborated

133
00:05:37,132 --> 00:05:38,598
professionally before.

134
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:40,600
Are you worried it might
affect our relationship?

135
00:05:40,602 --> 00:05:42,836
That is a valid point.

136
00:05:42,838 --> 00:05:45,371
Perhaps we should establish
some ground rules.

137
00:05:45,373 --> 00:05:46,840
Well, that would
make me feel better.

138
00:05:46,842 --> 00:05:47,941
All right, let's
start right now.

139
00:05:47,943 --> 00:05:50,710
Uh, rule number one,
no using sexuality

140
00:05:50,712 --> 00:05:52,579
to get your way.

141
00:05:53,648 --> 00:05:55,281
That's a ridiculous rule.

142
00:05:55,283 --> 00:05:57,083
Is it?

143
00:06:03,525 --> 00:06:06,259
Okay, how is that?

144
00:06:11,933 --> 00:06:13,600
I can actually feel the toxins

145
00:06:13,602 --> 00:06:16,302
being pulled out of my skin.

146
00:06:16,304 --> 00:06:19,138
Well, this is
a moisturizing mask.

147
00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:21,407
Oh, well, then I can
actually feel

148
00:06:21,409 --> 00:06:25,111
the moisture going into my skin.

149
00:06:25,113 --> 00:06:26,379
Hey, I hope you don't mind,
I used a little

150
00:06:26,381 --> 00:06:27,814
of your eye cream
last night.

151
00:06:27,816 --> 00:06:30,350
I thought someone looked
brighter and tighter.

152
00:06:36,258 --> 00:06:39,025
I'd still like to know
who Jerry is.

153
00:06:39,027 --> 00:06:40,693
Don't worry about it.
Hey, after this,

154
00:06:40,695 --> 00:06:42,395
how about we all go out
and do something together?

155
00:06:42,397 --> 00:06:44,764
That would be great.
Thank you.

156
00:06:44,766 --> 00:06:46,065
You want to go shopping?

157
00:06:46,067 --> 00:06:48,401
Ooh, yes. Fun.

158
00:06:48,403 --> 00:06:50,136
Or we could do something
we'll all enjoy,

159
00:06:50,138 --> 00:06:51,571
like play a board game.

160
00:06:55,510 --> 00:06:58,611
? Imagine me and you, I do ?

161
00:06:58,613 --> 00:07:01,748
? I think about you
day and night ?

162
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:05,184
? It's only right to think
about the one you love ?

163
00:07:05,186 --> 00:07:07,186
? And hold her tight ?

164
00:07:07,188 --> 00:07:10,189
? So happy together ?

165
00:07:11,359 --> 00:07:15,962
? I can't see me
lovin' nobody but you ?

166
00:07:15,964 --> 00:07:19,799
? For all my life ?

167
00:07:19,801 --> 00:07:21,834
? When you're with me ?

168
00:07:21,836 --> 00:07:25,071
? Baby, the skies will be blue ?

169
00:07:25,073 --> 00:07:28,274
? For all my life. ?

170
00:07:28,276 --> 00:07:30,710
I believe I've
made some progress

171
00:07:30,712 --> 00:07:32,879
on our ground rules.
Oh, good.

172
00:07:32,881 --> 00:07:34,514
What are they?
Okay, uh,

173
00:07:34,516 --> 00:07:36,416
number one:
in matters of physics,

174
00:07:36,418 --> 00:07:38,017
I have the final say.

175
00:07:38,019 --> 00:07:41,054
In matters of neuroscience,
you have the final say.

176
00:07:41,056 --> 00:07:42,322
Unless I disagree.

177
00:07:42,324 --> 00:07:44,524
Oh, here.

178
00:07:44,526 --> 00:07:47,627
Number two: when we publish,
my name goes first.

179
00:07:47,629 --> 00:07:50,697
Oh, subsequently, if we win any
awards, I speak first.

180
00:07:50,699 --> 00:07:53,299
I don't want to be talking when
the orchestra plays us off.

181
00:07:53,301 --> 00:07:55,568
Can I see that?

182
00:07:55,570 --> 00:07:57,070
Oh, of course.

183
00:08:02,744 --> 00:08:05,311
I'll get that back.

184
00:08:05,313 --> 00:08:06,946
Like all my underwear,
that notebook says

185
00:08:06,948 --> 00:08:09,048
"Property of Sheldon Cooper."

186
00:08:09,050 --> 00:08:11,784
Sheldon, if we're
gonna have ground rules,

187
00:08:11,786 --> 00:08:13,219
I'll tell you
the first ground rule--

188
00:08:13,221 --> 00:08:14,554
I make the ground rules.

189
00:08:14,556 --> 00:08:17,390
I'd write that down,
but I can't now, can I?

190
00:08:21,096 --> 00:08:23,296
I mean, they didn't
<i>say</i> anything,

191
00:08:23,298 --> 00:08:24,797
but I just kind of
felt like I was being

192
00:08:24,799 --> 00:08:26,265
a weird third wheel.

193
00:08:26,267 --> 00:08:29,869
Huh, so you <i>can</i> tell
what that feels like.

194
00:08:29,871 --> 00:08:31,371
Interesting.

195
00:08:32,641 --> 00:08:35,041
Anyway, I figured I can
hang out with my friends

196
00:08:35,043 --> 00:08:36,509
and have fun, too.

197
00:08:36,511 --> 00:08:39,212
Well, if your idea of fun
is riding in a minivan

198
00:08:39,214 --> 00:08:40,279
to Target for diapers,

199
00:08:40,281 --> 00:08:42,348
things are about
to get nuts.

200
00:08:43,685 --> 00:08:45,518
Oh, it's just nice
to be with people

201
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:47,086
who are happy to have me around.

202
00:08:47,088 --> 00:08:48,888
Isn't that right, Halley?

203
00:08:48,890 --> 00:08:51,190
(Halley crying)

204
00:08:52,227 --> 00:08:54,827
Well, at least someone had
the courage to say it.

205
00:08:57,265 --> 00:08:59,499
Thank you, you are
a good citizen.

206
00:08:59,501 --> 00:09:01,768
Told you.

207
00:09:02,904 --> 00:09:04,270
Go ahead, throw
my underwear out the window.

208
00:09:04,272 --> 00:09:05,438
Same thing's gonna happen.

209
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:07,840
Terrific.

210
00:09:07,842 --> 00:09:09,375
Do you want to hear our
new set of ground rules?

211
00:09:09,377 --> 00:09:10,643
Fire away.

212
00:09:10,645 --> 00:09:13,813
Number one:
we're on the same team,

213
00:09:13,815 --> 00:09:15,048
we're not in competition.

214
00:09:15,050 --> 00:09:18,985
That's smart, because
Sheldon: 1, Amy: 0.

215
00:09:20,155 --> 00:09:23,022
Number two: disagreements
can happen politely.

216
00:09:23,024 --> 00:09:25,625
There's no need
to call an idea stupid.

217
00:09:25,627 --> 00:09:29,095
Aw, someone drew
a penis in it.

218
00:09:30,198 --> 00:09:32,131
Are you listening?

219
00:09:32,133 --> 00:09:33,499
I'm sorry,
go ahead.

220
00:09:33,501 --> 00:09:34,701
Number three.

221
00:09:34,703 --> 00:09:37,336
To avoid getting frustrated,
we take built-in breaks

222
00:09:37,338 --> 00:09:39,672
and reward our successes
with a small treat.

223
00:09:39,674 --> 00:09:41,274
Ooh, that sounds fun.

224
00:09:41,276 --> 00:09:43,176
Now, we're talking about
real treats, right?

225
00:09:43,178 --> 00:09:46,546
Not Bible verses like my
mother used to give me.

226
00:09:46,548 --> 00:09:48,915
Whatever you want.

227
00:09:48,917 --> 00:09:51,350
So, shall we get to work?

228
00:09:51,352 --> 00:09:53,486
Biology and physics
coming together--

229
00:09:53,488 --> 00:09:56,355
this is like the peanut
butter cup of the mind.

230
00:09:56,357 --> 00:09:58,925
Oh, I know what I
want my treat to be!

231
00:10:00,862 --> 00:10:03,830
? Imagine me and you, I do ?

232
00:10:03,832 --> 00:10:06,999
? I think about you
day and night ?

233
00:10:07,001 --> 00:10:08,501
? It's only right ?

234
00:10:08,503 --> 00:10:10,603
? To think about
the girl you love ?

235
00:10:10,605 --> 00:10:11,871
? And hold her tight ?

236
00:10:11,873 --> 00:10:15,475
? So happy together ?

237
00:10:16,678 --> 00:10:19,912
? If I should call you up,
invest a dime ?

238
00:10:19,914 --> 00:10:21,748
? And you say you belong to me ?

239
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:24,650
? And ease my mind ?

240
00:10:24,652 --> 00:10:27,954
? Imagine how the world
could be, so very fine ?

241
00:10:27,956 --> 00:10:32,024
? So happy together ?

242
00:10:33,261 --> 00:10:35,161
? I can't see me ?

243
00:10:35,163 --> 00:10:37,964
? Lovin' nobody but you ?

244
00:10:37,966 --> 00:10:41,634
? For all my life... ?

245
00:10:43,271 --> 00:10:45,438
Wow.
Look at that.

246
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:48,141
Yes, this is remarkable.

247
00:10:48,143 --> 00:10:50,943
So we're agreed:
it's complete garbage.

248
00:10:53,848 --> 00:10:55,648
By the way,
your name can go first.

249
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:03,074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

250
00:11:05,688 --> 00:11:07,598
I mean, I'm glad
they're getting along,

251
00:11:07,599 --> 00:11:09,466
but it's starting to
make me uncomfortable.

252
00:11:09,468 --> 00:11:11,868
Well, are you worried he's
like another man in her life?

253
00:11:11,870 --> 00:11:14,838
A little, until I saw them
in matching tops, so...

254
00:11:16,341 --> 00:11:18,642
Nice. 174 diapers.

255
00:11:18,644 --> 00:11:20,844
That ought
to get us to Wednesday.

256
00:11:22,714 --> 00:11:24,481
Well, have you talked
to them about it?

257
00:11:24,483 --> 00:11:26,149
Well, what am I
supposed to say--

258
00:11:26,151 --> 00:11:27,717
"Stop having fun without me"?

259
00:11:27,719 --> 00:11:30,387
This one says that
every time I go out.

260
00:11:31,023 --> 00:11:33,023
See? I listen to you.

261
00:11:34,893 --> 00:11:37,494
Look, Raj just
gets along with women.

262
00:11:37,496 --> 00:11:38,695
I-I know,

263
00:11:38,697 --> 00:11:40,230
but he was my friend first.

264
00:11:40,232 --> 00:11:41,665
It's like she's stealing him

265
00:11:41,667 --> 00:11:43,300
and they're just
having the best time

266
00:11:43,302 --> 00:11:46,169
doing all their dumb
girly stuff together.

267
00:11:46,171 --> 00:11:47,337
You sure you don't fit in?

268
00:11:47,339 --> 00:11:49,573
You sound like
a catty bitch to me.

269
00:11:55,514 --> 00:11:57,180
I don't know where
we went wrong.

270
00:11:57,182 --> 00:11:59,649
Yeah, the math is so inelegant.

271
00:11:59,651 --> 00:12:02,752
I'm not even sure
it makes sense.

272
00:12:02,754 --> 00:12:05,322
Well, don't give up.
Maybe we can fix it.

273
00:12:11,063 --> 00:12:13,063
Can you stop breathing
so loud?

274
00:12:13,065 --> 00:12:16,199
I can hear your nose
whistling.

275
00:12:16,201 --> 00:12:19,336
I can hear your face
talking, so we're even.

276
00:12:24,576 --> 00:12:27,310
All right,
either blow your nose

277
00:12:27,312 --> 00:12:29,012
or teach it to play
"Camptown Races."

278
00:12:30,549 --> 00:12:32,782
Fine. Fine.
You want me to blow my nose?

279
00:12:32,784 --> 00:12:34,084
Here, I'll blow it.

280
00:12:34,086 --> 00:12:37,320
(nose blowing aggressively)

281
00:12:39,925 --> 00:12:41,291
Better?

282
00:12:41,293 --> 00:12:43,627
No, I can still hear it.

283
00:12:43,629 --> 00:12:46,463
Oh, wait, that's me.
Never mind, it's fine.

284
00:12:46,465 --> 00:12:47,697
You know, you're
exhausting.

285
00:12:47,699 --> 00:12:49,432
I knew working together
was a bad idea.

286
00:12:49,434 --> 00:12:51,168
Hold on.

287
00:12:51,170 --> 00:12:54,137
I see what's wrong here.
We did the propagation only to

288
00:12:54,139 --> 00:12:56,773
the occipital lobe, not
to the prefrontal cortex.

289
00:12:56,775 --> 00:13:00,310
That would mean that
this delayed parameter

290
00:13:00,312 --> 00:13:03,446
should be increased
250 milliseconds.

291
00:13:03,448 --> 00:13:05,982
Oh, that is much better.

292
00:13:05,984 --> 00:13:08,585
Yeah, boy, if good ideas
came out of your brain the way

293
00:13:08,587 --> 00:13:10,754
mucus comes out of your nose,
we'd be in good shape.

294
00:13:14,993 --> 00:13:17,794
Now, take a sip,

295
00:13:17,796 --> 00:13:19,663
swirl it around
your mouth,

296
00:13:19,665 --> 00:13:21,464
and try to notice
the flavors,

297
00:13:21,466 --> 00:13:24,801
the tannins,
the textures.

298
00:13:27,539 --> 00:13:28,538
Well?

299
00:13:28,540 --> 00:13:30,340
I probably should have

300
00:13:30,342 --> 00:13:32,576
spit out my gum first.

301
00:13:32,578 --> 00:13:36,746
(both laugh)

302
00:13:36,748 --> 00:13:39,115
Yeah. You know,

303
00:13:39,117 --> 00:13:40,951
the last couple of weeks
have been pretty rough,

304
00:13:40,953 --> 00:13:42,319
but, uh, staying
here with you guys

305
00:13:42,321 --> 00:13:43,927
has really helped take
my mind off of it.

306
00:13:43,951 --> 00:13:44,655
Mm. Well,

307
00:13:44,656 --> 00:13:46,790
we've loved having you around.
Right, sweetie?

308
00:13:49,261 --> 00:13:50,827
Leonard?

309
00:13:50,829 --> 00:13:52,629
Yeah, when
did he leave?

310
00:13:52,631 --> 00:13:54,998
Yeah, that's rude.

311
00:13:57,135 --> 00:13:59,502
You know, it's nice
to spend time with people

312
00:13:59,504 --> 00:14:03,106
who don't talk about work like
it's some kind of soap opera.

313
00:14:03,108 --> 00:14:06,042
Jennifer still trying
to sleep her way to the top?

314
00:14:07,913 --> 00:14:09,779
Yeah.

315
00:14:09,781 --> 00:14:13,116
You should be happy someone
wants to do the stuff with Penny

316
00:14:13,118 --> 00:14:14,351
you don't want to.

317
00:14:14,353 --> 00:14:16,080
Yeah, I wish I had that
with Howard.

318
00:14:16,104 --> 00:14:16,921
Wait.

319
00:14:16,922 --> 00:14:19,389
What? What do I make you do?

320
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:21,291
Let's see:
the magic store,

321
00:14:21,293 --> 00:14:22,826
the <i>Doctor Who</i>
convention,

322
00:14:22,828 --> 00:14:26,029
the National Belt Buckle
Collector's meet and greet.

323
00:14:26,031 --> 00:14:29,132
It said right there
on the invitation,

324
00:14:29,134 --> 00:14:30,233
"Buckle up for fun."

325
00:14:30,235 --> 00:14:31,935
It's not my fault
you didn't listen.

326
00:14:33,538 --> 00:14:35,872
I'm sure I'm overreacting.

327
00:14:35,874 --> 00:14:37,874
You're entitled
to feel how you feel.

328
00:14:37,876 --> 00:14:40,076
If you don't like it,
you should just talk to her.

329
00:14:40,078 --> 00:14:42,445
I don't want to sound
like a jealous baby.

330
00:14:42,447 --> 00:14:45,282
Oh, then maybe
you shouldn't talk to her.

331
00:14:47,552 --> 00:14:48,685
You know, I
had a feeling

332
00:14:48,687 --> 00:14:50,287
you were using the wrong
computational model,

333
00:14:50,289 --> 00:14:52,455
but I didn't say anything
'cause you're so sensitive.

334
00:14:52,457 --> 00:14:54,124
(grunts) Just because
I am easily bothered

335
00:14:54,126 --> 00:14:56,559
by light, heat, sound, smell
and the way birds look at me

336
00:14:56,561 --> 00:14:57,861
does not mean
I'm sensitive!

337
00:15:00,132 --> 00:15:01,598
Hey,

338
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:04,100
I wonder what kind of success
we'd have

339
00:15:04,102 --> 00:15:07,237
if we defined measurement
as the first moment

340
00:15:07,239 --> 00:15:09,973
that an action potential
is seen by the visual cortex.

341
00:15:09,975 --> 00:15:13,943
(gasps) That is a daring
and insightful solution.

342
00:15:13,945 --> 00:15:15,478
We're finally making progress.

343
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:17,314
I wish we could do it
without fighting.

344
00:15:17,316 --> 00:15:21,318
What if the fighting is the
reason we're making progress?

345
00:15:22,521 --> 00:15:25,422
I suppose it's conceivable
that the hormones associated

346
00:15:25,424 --> 00:15:27,324
with our fight-or-flight
response

347
00:15:27,326 --> 00:15:29,793
could be sharpening
our cognitive processes.

348
00:15:29,795 --> 00:15:31,861
Well, if that's the case,

349
00:15:31,863 --> 00:15:35,765
then your grandparents mumble
and have bad posture.

350
00:15:37,536 --> 00:15:39,669
How dare you speak that way
about my Grammy--

351
00:15:39,671 --> 00:15:41,304
hey, wait a second. Wait.

352
00:15:44,376 --> 00:15:48,478
Delta "T" could equal
alpha sub-zero.

353
00:15:49,247 --> 00:15:52,816
It seems we have
a choice to make.

354
00:15:52,818 --> 00:15:56,353
Abandon all ground rules
in the name of science,

355
00:15:56,355 --> 00:16:00,590
or... give up collaborating for
the sake of our relationship.

356
00:16:00,592 --> 00:16:03,860
There's only one
clear choice.

357
00:16:03,862 --> 00:16:06,663
Science it is.
No, you bonehead!

358
00:16:06,665 --> 00:16:09,132
Name-calling,
that is perfect.

359
00:16:09,134 --> 00:16:10,767
Now, when I get
to this equation here,

360
00:16:10,769 --> 00:16:12,102
really let me have it.
You know?

361
00:16:12,104 --> 00:16:14,104
I-If it helps,
I'm not the sharpest dresser.

362
00:16:17,609 --> 00:16:21,411
Anyway, I know it's silly,
but since Raj moved in,

363
00:16:21,413 --> 00:16:23,380
I've been feeling
a little left out.

364
00:16:26,218 --> 00:16:29,753
Well, sweetie,
that's crazy.

365
00:16:29,755 --> 00:16:31,921
No, no, Penny,
don't dismiss his feelings.

366
00:16:31,923 --> 00:16:32,856
Thank you. I just feel...

367
00:16:32,858 --> 00:16:34,657
Hang on,
I'm not saying

368
00:16:34,659 --> 00:16:36,326
that his feelings
aren't crazy.

369
00:16:36,328 --> 00:16:37,994
I just don't want him
to think that

370
00:16:37,996 --> 00:16:39,329
this isn't
a safe place.

371
00:16:39,331 --> 00:16:40,597
Well, to be truthful...

372
00:16:40,599 --> 00:16:41,965
PENNY: Well, why wouldn't
this be a safe place? I mean,

373
00:16:41,967 --> 00:16:44,100
he's surrounded by his wife
and one of his best friends.

374
00:16:44,102 --> 00:16:45,602
I don't want to
speak for Leonard.

375
00:16:45,604 --> 00:16:46,636
Thank you. I...

376
00:16:46,638 --> 00:16:47,637
But when
you're insecure,

377
00:16:47,639 --> 00:16:49,239
no amount
of external validation

378
00:16:49,241 --> 00:16:51,431
can ever make you
feel safe.

379
00:16:51,455 --> 00:16:53,209
Yeah, you're right. You know,
you're really sensitive

380
00:16:53,211 --> 00:16:54,811
about this
kind of stuff.

381
00:16:54,813 --> 00:16:57,747
I'm a good listener.
(chuckles) Yeah.

382
00:16:57,749 --> 00:16:59,516
Hey, Olsen twins...

383
00:17:01,353 --> 00:17:02,485
What?

384
00:17:02,487 --> 00:17:04,921
Well, I-I mean, I'm
sitting right here.

385
00:17:04,923 --> 00:17:06,289
You're talking about my feelings

386
00:17:06,291 --> 00:17:08,558
and somehow leaving me
out of the conversation.

387
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:10,927
I'm sorry.
What did you want to say?

388
00:17:10,929 --> 00:17:13,997
I don't know,
you pretty much covered it.

389
00:17:13,999 --> 00:17:17,267
? So happy together. ?

390
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:23,139
Various: (Shouting) Heigh!

391
00:17:24,913 --> 00:17:27,280
Can you
read them back?

392
00:17:27,282 --> 00:17:29,415
"Revised ground
rule number one:

393
00:17:29,417 --> 00:17:33,052
We are on the same team,
but it <i>is</i> a competition."

394
00:17:34,923 --> 00:17:36,222
Excellent. Excellent.

395
00:17:36,224 --> 00:17:38,892
And on a related point,
you're going down, punk.

396
00:17:38,894 --> 00:17:42,128
"Revised ground rule number two:

397
00:17:42,130 --> 00:17:44,898
"There are definitely
stupid questions.

398
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:46,799
"And those who ask them
can be told so

399
00:17:46,801 --> 00:17:49,669
right to their stupid face."

400
00:17:50,539 --> 00:17:53,006
I love that one.

401
00:17:53,008 --> 00:17:55,441
Thanks, babe.

402
00:17:55,443 --> 00:17:58,011
"Number three:

403
00:17:58,013 --> 00:18:00,246
"Fair topics for
insult include

404
00:18:00,248 --> 00:18:02,782
"educational pedigree,
scientific field,

405
00:18:02,784 --> 00:18:06,986
intellectual prowess,
and mamas."

406
00:18:06,988 --> 00:18:09,622
Yeah, that list is strong.

407
00:18:10,229 --> 00:18:13,297
Like your mother's urge
to be promiscuous with sailors.
