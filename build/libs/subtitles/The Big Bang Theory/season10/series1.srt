Dad,
this is Sheldon's mother, Mary.

00:00:04,268 --> 00:00:04,964
How do you do?

4
00:00:04,965 --> 00:00:06,181
Nice to meet you.

5
00:00:06,183 --> 00:00:07,215
And, of course, Mom.

6
00:00:07,217 --> 00:00:09,384
Hello, my hateful shrew.

7
00:00:09,386 --> 00:00:12,971
Hello to you,
you wrinkled old bastard.

00:00:15,142 --> 00:00:16,307
Hey.

10
00:00:16,309 --> 00:00:19,110
Just got an e-mail
from the U.S. Air Force.

11
00:00:19,112 --> 00:00:23,198
I'm just afraid if I respond,
then they'll know I got it.

12
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:25,700
Dude, the minute you opened that
e-mail, they knew you got it.

13
00:00:25,702 --> 00:00:26,618
I mean, they're probably
looking at you

14
00:00:26,620 --> 00:00:29,571
through the camera
right now.

15
00:00:29,573 --> 00:00:31,322
Oh, God.

16
00:00:31,324 --> 00:00:33,541
I think someone's
following us.

17
00:00:34,911 --> 00:00:37,212
Uh, turn left here
and see if he turns with us.

18
00:00:37,214 --> 00:00:39,247
Why is he turning here?
The restaurant's the other way.

19
00:00:39,249 --> 00:00:41,416
I don't know.
He uses that traffic app.

20
00:00:41,418 --> 00:00:42,750
Maybe there's an accident.

21
00:00:42,752 --> 00:00:44,335
Oh, so follow him.

22
00:00:44,337 --> 00:00:47,222
Oh, no!

23
00:00:48,058 --> 00:00:49,140
Leonard, if you don't mind,

24
00:00:49,142 --> 00:00:50,391
I think I'm a little tired.

25
00:00:50,393 --> 00:00:51,476
I'm gonna call it a night.

26
00:00:51,478 --> 00:00:52,677
Sure, Dad.

27
00:00:52,679 --> 00:00:54,429
I'm a little
tuckered out myself.

28
00:00:54,431 --> 00:00:57,649
Well, I will see you
all in the morning.

29
00:00:57,651 --> 00:00:59,100
Would you like to share a cab?

30
00:00:59,102 --> 00:01:00,185
That would be fine.

31
00:01:00,187 --> 00:01:01,936
Where are you staying?
I'm at the Westin.

32
00:01:01,938 --> 00:01:03,021
Well, so am I.

33
00:01:03,023 --> 00:01:04,405
Could I interest
you in a nightcap?

34
00:01:04,407 --> 00:01:06,274
I think that you could.

38
00:01:17,837 --> 00:01:21,172
You realize you and I
could become brothers.

39
00:01:22,042 --> 00:01:23,958
We're not gonna be brothers.

46
00:01:36,389 --> 00:01:38,556
Okay.

47
00:01:41,311 --> 00:01:43,228
Do you think your father's
doing unspeakable things

48
00:01:43,230 --> 00:01:45,980
to my mother?

49
00:01:45,982 --> 00:01:47,148
No.

50
00:01:47,150 --> 00:01:48,483
Are you saying that

51
00:01:48,485 --> 00:01:50,702
because the things
are unspeakable?

52
00:01:50,704 --> 00:01:51,903
Your parents are old.

53
00:01:51,905 --> 00:01:53,905
Anything unspeakable
was finished by 9:30.

54
00:01:53,907 --> 00:01:55,123
Go to sleep.

55
00:01:55,959 --> 00:01:58,159
Very well.

56
00:01:59,996 --> 00:02:03,715
I'm sorry if this stuff is gonna
make the ceremony awkward.

57
00:02:03,717 --> 00:02:05,466
God, I thought my brother
fresh out of jail

00:02:05,468 --> 00:02:07,228
was gonna make everyone
uncomfortable, but now this...

Neanderthals developed tools ?

00:06:59,501 --> 00:07:00,617
Yeah.

176
00:07:00,619 --> 00:07:02,786
I would not have
done that for you.

177
00:07:03,923 --> 00:07:06,757
Howard, please just call
the man, see what he wants.

178
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:08,675
All right, all right.

179
00:07:08,677 --> 00:07:10,127
Hey,

180
00:07:10,129 --> 00:07:12,179
make sure you tell him that
you weren't home when he came by

181
00:07:12,181 --> 00:07:14,181
and that your Indian friend
gave you the message

182
00:07:14,183 --> 00:07:16,850
the moment
you stepped through the door.

183
00:07:16,852 --> 00:07:20,470
Yes, hello.
<font color="#D900D9">(clears throat)</font> Uh,

184
00:07:20,472 --> 00:07:23,557
this is Howard Wolowitz
for Colonel Richard Williams.

185
00:07:23,559 --> 00:07:25,225
Oh, I take it back,
don't mention me.

186
00:07:25,227 --> 00:07:28,312
Hi, Colonel Williams,
how can I help you?

187
00:07:28,314 --> 00:07:31,615
What? Oh, uh, yes,
he is from India.

188
00:07:33,535 --> 00:07:36,653
No, I don't know
his immigration status.

189
00:07:39,491 --> 00:07:42,659
Relax, I'm still on hold!

190
00:07:44,163 --> 00:07:46,246
Speaking.

191
00:07:46,248 --> 00:07:50,417
Okay, sure,
I can meet with you on Thursday.

192
00:07:50,419 --> 00:07:52,002
Caltech is fine.

193
00:07:52,004 --> 00:07:54,171
Yeah, and may I ask
what this is about?

194
00:07:54,173 --> 00:07:55,555
<font color="#D900D9">(chuckles)</font>

195
00:07:55,557 --> 00:07:57,507
I may not?

196
00:07:57,509 --> 00:08:00,510
That's what he said to me.

197
00:08:01,647 --> 00:08:02,763
Here you are, Mother.

198
00:08:02,765 --> 00:08:04,398
Thank you.

199
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,066
I'm glad you decided to stay.

200
00:08:06,068 --> 00:08:09,519
It's gonna be special for Penny
and me to share this with you.

201
00:08:09,521 --> 00:08:13,240
I can't wait
for this day to be over.

202
00:08:14,076 --> 00:08:16,443
Yeah, special, like that.

203
00:08:17,279 --> 00:08:19,863
<font color="#0CEC0C">(knocking on door)</font>
That's them.

204
00:08:19,865 --> 00:08:20,864
Please don't make things

205
00:08:20,866 --> 00:08:22,833
any more awkward
than they already are.

206
00:08:22,835 --> 00:08:26,920
All right, so less
or equally awkward, got it.

207
00:08:28,424 --> 00:08:29,506
Hey, guys, come on in.

208
00:08:29,508 --> 00:08:31,174
Oh, thank you.
Good morning.

209
00:08:31,176 --> 00:08:32,092
Morning.
Hello.

210
00:08:32,094 --> 00:08:34,094
How is everyone today?

211
00:08:34,096 --> 00:08:35,095
Good, and you?

212
00:08:35,097 --> 00:08:37,180
Good, good.
Good.

213
00:08:37,182 --> 00:08:38,548
I'm good, too.

214
00:08:38,550 --> 00:08:40,434
Good.

215
00:08:43,222 --> 00:08:45,439
So, did you defile
my mother or not?

216
00:08:46,392 --> 00:08:48,942
Sheldon!

217
00:08:48,944 --> 00:08:51,028
You're being rude.

218
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:52,446
If I may, I can assure you,

219
00:08:52,448 --> 00:08:53,897
your mother and I
did nothing more

220
00:08:53,899 --> 00:08:56,116
than share a cab
and a conversation.

221
00:08:56,118 --> 00:08:58,285
Did that conversation
include the phrase

222
00:08:58,287 --> 00:09:00,454
"your genitals
are a joy to behold"?

223
00:09:00,456 --> 00:09:02,656
That's enough!

224
00:09:02,658 --> 00:09:07,627
Look, I promise you, neither I,
nor anyone, has ever said that.

225
00:09:07,629 --> 00:09:12,299
You don't know his girlfriend
very well.

226
00:09:12,301 --> 00:09:15,419
Or what a joy it is
to behold my genitals.

227
00:09:17,589 --> 00:09:20,090
All right, you guys, uh,
get settled in,

228
00:09:20,092 --> 00:09:22,342
then we'll go across the hall
and say hi to everyone.

229
00:09:22,344 --> 00:09:24,811
You know, It's hard to believe
I've never met Leonard.

230
00:09:24,813 --> 00:09:27,097
Well, he probably buys
his illegal drugs

231
00:09:27,099 --> 00:09:28,265
from a local vendor.

232
00:09:28,267 --> 00:09:29,683
<font color="#D900D9">(chuckles)</font>

233
00:09:29,685 --> 00:09:31,234
Not funny, Wyatt.

234
00:09:31,236 --> 00:09:33,770
I thought it was really funny.
Thanks.

235
00:09:33,772 --> 00:09:37,157
Well, fine, if everyone wants to
make jokes about our problems,

236
00:09:37,159 --> 00:09:38,108
then I can, too.

237
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:40,444
Knock, knock.
Who's there?

238
00:09:40,446 --> 00:09:43,163
Our family is an embarrassment.

239
00:09:43,165 --> 00:09:45,092
That's not much of a joke.

240
00:09:45,093 --> 00:09:45,747
<b><font color="#FF8000">PENNY:</font></b> Okay.

241
00:09:45,751 --> 00:09:48,118
Listen, Mom, I know you're
nervous, but I promise you,

242
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:50,454
no one is gonna judge you
or this family.

243
00:09:50,456 --> 00:09:51,955
Oh, I'm sorry.

244
00:09:51,957 --> 00:09:53,290
It's just we're meeting
Leonard's parents

245
00:09:53,292 --> 00:09:54,624
for the first time,

246
00:09:54,626 --> 00:09:57,794
and-and they're academics
and-and intellectuals,

247
00:09:57,796 --> 00:10:00,180
and I don't want them thinking
we're white trash.

248
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:04,601
Well, what color trash
do you think they'll believe?

249
00:10:07,139 --> 00:10:08,972
How could you think
that I would spend the night

250
00:10:08,974 --> 00:10:10,390
with a man I just met?

251
00:10:10,392 --> 00:10:13,810
A man named Jesus convinced you
to build a church in Africa.

252
00:10:13,812 --> 00:10:16,146
You're kind of a sucker.

253
00:10:16,148 --> 00:10:19,483
Well, nothing happened, right?

254
00:10:19,485 --> 00:10:20,367
I-It's over.

255
00:10:20,369 --> 00:10:21,651
Until we get married
a third time,

256
00:10:21,653 --> 00:10:24,571
you guys will never have
to see each other again.

257
00:10:24,573 --> 00:10:26,456
Well, you know, actually
that's not the case.

258
00:10:26,458 --> 00:10:28,742
Mary may visit me in New York.
<font color="#804040">MARY:</font> Mm-hmm.

259
00:10:28,744 --> 00:10:30,911
And he's never been to Texas.

260
00:10:30,913 --> 00:10:32,212
Maybe we meet halfway.

261
00:10:32,214 --> 00:10:36,917
What? In the Chattahoochee
National Forest in Georgia?

262
00:10:36,919 --> 00:10:41,888
I can't be the only one
that knows that's halfway.

263
00:10:41,890 --> 00:10:44,098
You're not seriously going
to visit each other.

264
00:10:44,122 --> 00:10:45,143
And why wouldn't we?

265
00:10:45,167 --> 00:10:47,231
Oh please, you're just saying
this to antagonize me.

266
00:10:47,524 --> 00:10:50,347
Oh, not at all. Mary happens
to be a wonderful woman.

267
00:10:50,349 --> 00:10:52,649
And if it antagonizes you,
that's just a bonus.

268
00:10:54,853 --> 00:10:57,070
Mary, I'm sorry you're
in the middle of this.

269
00:10:57,072 --> 00:10:59,105
No, no, nothing to be
sorry about.

270
00:10:59,107 --> 00:11:01,358
I genuinely like your father.

271
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:04,110
What? But he's a
mediocre academic.

272
00:11:04,112 --> 00:11:07,697
And according to Beverly,
his sexual prowess is subpar.

273
00:11:08,834 --> 00:11:12,118
He's basically Leonard
with a bigger prostate.

274
00:11:14,506 --> 00:11:17,724
Are you saying that my dad's
not good enough for your mom?

275
00:11:17,726 --> 00:11:20,043
Yes, while also getting in
a solid dig at you.

276
00:11:20,045 --> 00:11:21,628
Pretty efficient, huh?

277
00:11:22,881 --> 00:11:25,715
<font color="#D900D9">(stammers)</font> This is ridiculous.
I-I'm going across the hall.

278
00:11:25,717 --> 00:11:27,634
But why should you get to go
and leave me here

279
00:11:27,636 --> 00:11:28,635
with your bickering parents?

280
00:11:28,637 --> 00:11:29,886
Fine, then you go!

281
00:11:29,888 --> 00:11:32,022
Well, I don't want to stay
here with her. I'll go.

282
00:11:32,024 --> 00:11:32,939
I'll go with you.

283
00:11:32,941 --> 00:11:34,191
That still leaves me
here with him.

284
00:11:34,193 --> 00:11:35,725
Hang on, hang on!

285
00:11:35,727 --> 00:11:37,227
We're smart, we can
figure this out.

286
00:11:37,229 --> 00:11:40,697
Okay, so: Mary and Beverly
can't be together.

287
00:11:40,699 --> 00:11:43,867
Uh, Alfred and Beverly
can't be together.

288
00:11:43,869 --> 00:11:46,369
Leonard and I can't be together.

289
00:11:46,371 --> 00:11:49,122
Now, I could be with Alfred...

290
00:11:49,124 --> 00:11:50,740
but I don't like his face.

291
00:11:52,327 --> 00:11:53,743
Oh, here! I've got it!

292
00:11:53,745 --> 00:11:55,412
Who's ready for a wedding?

293
00:11:55,414 --> 00:11:57,747
Great, now I have
to start all over.

294
00:12:05,958 --> 00:12:08,125
So how's the world
of pharmaceuticals treating you?

295
00:12:08,127 --> 00:12:09,793
Pretty good. I actually
just got assigned

296
00:12:09,795 --> 00:12:11,178
a much better territory.

297
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:13,797
See what happens
when you work hard?

298
00:12:13,799 --> 00:12:17,184
Hey, she just sells drugs.
I had to make 'em.

299
00:12:18,103 --> 00:12:19,636
Okay, that's enough.

300
00:12:19,638 --> 00:12:22,389
No more drug talk
for the rest of this trip.

301
00:12:22,391 --> 00:12:24,808
I'll drink to that.

302
00:12:24,810 --> 00:12:25,726
Haven't you had enough?

303
00:12:25,728 --> 00:12:27,394
Penny drinks
more than I do.

304
00:12:27,396 --> 00:12:29,863
Well, I learned
from the best.

305
00:12:29,865 --> 00:12:31,698
Aw!
Aw!

306
00:12:32,735 --> 00:12:34,067
Very nice, Wyatt.

307
00:12:34,069 --> 00:12:36,703
And you wonder why this one
turned out the way he did.

308
00:12:36,705 --> 00:12:39,039
You see what I've gotta
put up with!

309
00:12:39,041 --> 00:12:41,041
What you've gotta put up with?

310
00:12:41,043 --> 00:12:42,743
Why did you have
to go to jail?

311
00:12:42,745 --> 00:12:45,963
It's called getting
caught, Mother!

312
00:12:45,965 --> 00:12:47,664
Hello!

313
00:12:47,666 --> 00:12:48,832
Hey, there he is!
Hey!

314
00:12:48,834 --> 00:12:51,752
Oh, Leonard! It's so
nice to see you again!

315
00:12:51,754 --> 00:12:52,836
Oh, you, too!

316
00:12:52,838 --> 00:12:55,305
Hey, everyone, this is
my mother, Beverly.

317
00:12:55,307 --> 00:12:56,423
Hello.
<font color="#804040">SUSAN:</font> Hi.

318
00:12:56,425 --> 00:12:59,643
We are not white trash!

319
00:13:03,899 --> 00:13:06,316
Are you excited to see your son
walk down the aisle?

320
00:13:06,318 --> 00:13:07,434
Yes, I am.

321
00:13:07,436 --> 00:13:08,652
I'm just feeling
a little guilty

322
00:13:08,654 --> 00:13:10,437
about all the trouble
I've caused.

323
00:13:10,439 --> 00:13:12,105
Oh, so am I.

324
00:13:12,107 --> 00:13:15,609
You made God sad today, Mom.

325
00:13:22,585 --> 00:13:24,251
Sheldon, they haven't done
anything wrong.

326
00:13:24,253 --> 00:13:26,787
I think it's nice
they're hitting it off.

327
00:13:26,789 --> 00:13:28,455
Well, that's still no reason
to rush into anything.

328
00:13:28,457 --> 00:13:29,539
<font color="#D900D9">(stammers)</font> Look at us.

329
00:13:29,541 --> 00:13:31,258
We took things
remarkably slow.

330
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:34,094
You and I, we didn't even
hold hands for two years.

331
00:13:35,264 --> 00:13:38,298
It was a lot hotter
than it sounds.

332
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:39,600
You're a patient
young lady.

333
00:13:39,602 --> 00:13:40,634
Hey, hey!

334
00:13:40,636 --> 00:13:42,803
She's mine! Take a cold shower,
grandpa!

335
00:13:46,942 --> 00:13:49,192
Why wouldn't that colonel say
what the meeting's about?

336
00:13:49,194 --> 00:13:50,727
It has to be bad news.

337
00:13:50,729 --> 00:13:52,980
Calm down, okay?
Try not to think about it.

338
00:13:52,982 --> 00:13:55,532
That's really stupid advice.

339
00:13:55,534 --> 00:13:57,367
You know that hurts
my feelings.

340
00:13:58,203 --> 00:14:00,537
Calm down, try not
to think about it.

341
00:14:01,573 --> 00:14:03,123
Okay.

342
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:06,326
Why do I bother
talking to you?

343
00:14:06,328 --> 00:14:08,996
Oh, come on. What's the worst
that could come of this meeting?

344
00:14:08,998 --> 00:14:11,131
I don't know. They take

Okay, that's not so bad.

347

You know what happened
to the scientists

348
00:14:15,587 --> 00:14:17,170
that worked
on the Manhattan Project?

349
00:14:17,172 --> 00:14:19,339
The government forced them
to move to the desert.

350
00:14:19,341 --> 00:14:22,509
They had to live in secret,
and when Oppenheimer objected

351
00:14:22,511 --> 00:14:23,677
to what they made him do,

352
00:14:23,679 --> 00:14:25,679
they destroyed his reputation.

353
00:14:26,765 --> 00:14:29,900
What's the point of that story?

354
00:14:31,186 --> 00:14:32,686
I just read a book
about Oppenheimer,

355
00:14:32,688 --> 00:14:35,989
