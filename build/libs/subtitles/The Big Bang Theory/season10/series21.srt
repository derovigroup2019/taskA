1
00:00:01,603 --> 00:00:03,186
All right, we're
about to go live.

2
00:00:03,188 --> 00:00:04,521
Everyone on
their A-game!

3
00:00:04,523 --> 00:00:06,456
Good energy!

4
00:00:06,458 --> 00:00:08,174
Hello.

5
00:00:09,978 --> 00:00:11,978
I'm Dr. Sheldon Cooper.

6
00:00:11,980 --> 00:00:13,980
And I'm
Dr. Amy Farrah Fowler.

7
00:00:13,982 --> 00:00:15,849
And welcome to a
special retrospective,

8
00:00:15,851 --> 00:00:17,817
where we will take a
look back at the history

9
00:00:17,819 --> 00:00:21,454
of <i>Fun with Flags</i> on an
episode we're calling...

10
00:00:21,456 --> 00:00:24,174
BOTH: “Fun with Flags:
Behind the Flags:

11
00:00:24,176 --> 00:00:27,544
A Retrospective.”

12
00:00:27,546 --> 00:00:29,212
(upbeat music playing)

13
00:00:29,214 --> 00:00:30,847
? Wondering how
it all began?

14
00:00:30,849 --> 00:00:32,715
? You'll need
a good attention span ?

15
00:00:32,717 --> 00:00:35,885
? For information
and entertainment ?

16
00:00:35,887 --> 00:00:38,805
? That's equally effective ?

17
00:00:38,807 --> 00:00:40,723
? It's fun with flags ?

18
00:00:40,725 --> 00:00:42,559
? Behind the flags ?

19
00:00:42,561 --> 00:00:45,528
? A retrospective ?

20
00:00:45,530 --> 00:00:47,447
? Flags. ?

21
00:00:51,069 --> 00:00:53,903
Mind you, when we say
“behind the flags”"

22
00:00:53,905 --> 00:00:56,239
we don't literally
mean these flags.

23
00:00:56,241 --> 00:00:59,275
That's just where
we have dinner.

24
00:00:59,277 --> 00:01:01,578
Now, I'm sure many of you
are wondering

25
00:01:01,580 --> 00:01:03,913
how <i>Fun with Flags</i> began.

26
00:01:03,915 --> 00:01:06,049
So let's hear from some
people who were there

27
00:01:06,051 --> 00:01:07,567
at the very start.

28
00:01:07,569 --> 00:01:09,669
H-Howard.
Flashback sounds.

29
00:01:09,671 --> 00:01:11,888
(piano playing arpeggios)

30
00:01:13,975 --> 00:01:15,258
Could have played
that on my harp.

31
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:17,660
Just roll the clip.

32
00:01:17,662 --> 00:01:19,846
SHELDON:
So tell us in your own words

33
00:01:19,848 --> 00:01:23,266
about that magical moment
when <i>Fun with Flags</i> was born.

34
00:01:23,268 --> 00:01:25,151
I honestly
don't remember.

35
00:01:26,938 --> 00:01:28,271
SHELDON:
Sure you do.

36
00:01:28,273 --> 00:01:29,906
I was telling you both
the story

37
00:01:29,908 --> 00:01:31,608
about how Haiti
and Lichtenstein

38
00:01:31,610 --> 00:01:33,409
discovered they had
the same flag.

39
00:01:33,411 --> 00:01:35,945
It was at
the Summer Olympics of 1936,

40
00:01:35,947 --> 00:01:37,280
and two plucky nations...

41
00:01:37,282 --> 00:01:38,615
Oh, wait. I remember.

42
00:01:38,617 --> 00:01:40,500
Oh, and do you remember
what you said?

43
00:01:40,502 --> 00:01:43,586
Yes. “Please find
someone who cares”"

44
00:01:45,123 --> 00:01:48,424
And that's exactly what I did.

45
00:01:48,426 --> 00:01:51,761
I found a lot
of someones.

46
00:01:51,763 --> 00:01:54,597
Almost 200.

47
00:01:54,599 --> 00:01:57,767
Many of them on purpose.

48
00:01:57,769 --> 00:02:00,803
And now we're going to turn
it over to you, the viewers,

49
00:02:00,805 --> 00:02:02,438
to call in and share

50
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:04,691
your favorite
<i>Fun with Flags</i> moments.

51
00:02:04,693 --> 00:02:07,477
And-and don't get discouraged
if the phone lines are jammed.

52
00:02:07,479 --> 00:02:09,646
Just keep trying.

00:02:30,802 --> 00:02:32,001
Oh, thank God!

56
00:02:32,003 --> 00:02:33,720
Welcome to <i>Fun with Flags!</i>

57
00:02:33,722 --> 00:02:35,054
BERT:
Hey, Sheldon.

58
00:02:35,056 --> 00:02:36,990
Hey, Amy. It's Bert.

59
00:02:36,992 --> 00:02:38,424
Hello, Bert.

60
00:02:38,426 --> 00:02:41,311
What is your flag-related
comment or query?

61
00:02:41,313 --> 00:02:43,630
I have a girlfriend.

62
00:02:45,467 --> 00:02:48,268
And what does that
have to do with flags?

63
00:02:48,270 --> 00:02:51,955
Nothing. I just wanted everyone
to know I have a girlfriend.

64
00:02:51,957 --> 00:02:54,190
Bert, you're
tying up the line.

65
00:02:54,192 --> 00:02:56,242
My apologies
to all of you

66
00:02:56,244 --> 00:02:58,828
trying to call in with
legitimate flag comments.

67
00:02:58,830 --> 00:03:00,196
Ooh, ooh. All right.

68
00:03:00,198 --> 00:03:01,831
W-We have our next caller.

69
00:03:01,833 --> 00:03:04,083
BERT:
Her name's Rebecca.

70
00:03:05,537 --> 00:03:09,505
? Our whole universe
was in a hot, dense state ?

71
00:03:09,507 --> 00:03:12,508
? Then nearly 14 billion years
ago expansion started... Wait! ?

72
00:03:12,510 --> 00:03:14,093
? The Earth began to cool ?

73
00:03:14,095 --> 00:03:17,030
? The autotrophs began to drool,
Neanderthals developed tools ?

74
00:03:17,032 --> 00:03:18,915
? We built the Wall ?
? <i>We built the pyramids</i> ?

75
00:03:18,917 --> 00:03:21,818
? Math, Science, History,
unraveling the mystery ?

76
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:23,820
? That all started
with a big bang ?

77
00:03:23,822 --> 00:03:24,853
? <i>Bang!</i> ?

78
00:03:24,854 --> 00:03:28,854

80
00:03:31,856 --> 00:03:35,158
Should we get lunch or
you want to eat at the zoo?

81
00:03:36,861 --> 00:03:38,861
(imitating Bernadette):
“Oh, Howie, I don't need food

82
00:03:38,863 --> 00:03:42,382
as long as I can
look at my phone”.

83
00:03:42,384 --> 00:03:44,701
I don't like
when you imitate me.

84
00:03:44,703 --> 00:03:46,369
You want to hear my Stuart?

85
00:03:46,371 --> 00:03:50,039
(imitating Stuart): “It's been a
while since I've gone on a date.

86
00:03:50,041 --> 00:03:53,927
You mind if we watch
the monkeys doing it?”

87
00:03:58,350 --> 00:04:01,217
I said that to you
in confidence.

88
00:04:02,721 --> 00:04:04,971
This is supposed to be
our family fun day.

89
00:04:04,973 --> 00:04:06,723
What's so important
on your phone?

90
00:04:06,725 --> 00:04:09,058
I'm on the day care's
Web site.

91
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:11,311
Stop looking at that.
The day care's great.

92
00:04:11,313 --> 00:04:12,562
It's on campus.

93
00:04:12,564 --> 00:04:13,896
My office is
two minutes away.

94
00:04:13,898 --> 00:04:15,348
There's nothing
to worry about.

95
00:04:15,350 --> 00:04:18,451
What if she likes the people
who work there more than us?

96
00:04:18,453 --> 00:04:21,537
She already likes soap bubbles
more than us.

97
00:04:21,539 --> 00:04:23,406
When I go back to work,

98
00:04:23,408 --> 00:04:25,074
we're gonna leave her
with these people.

99
00:04:25,076 --> 00:04:26,709
We don't know anything
about them.

100
00:04:26,711 --> 00:04:30,496
They're highly-trained educators
with background checks.

101
00:04:30,498 --> 00:04:33,967
They're even required to be
current on all vaccinations.

102
00:04:35,103 --> 00:04:37,420
You leave her with me,
and I'm not any of those things.

103
00:04:40,925 --> 00:04:42,258
Where's Howard?

104
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:44,427
He took the day off.

105
00:04:44,429 --> 00:04:46,763
Oh, let's take advantage
of his absence

106
00:04:46,765 --> 00:04:49,098
and tell the kinds of jokes
only physicists get.

107
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:51,150
I'll go first.

108
00:04:51,152 --> 00:04:54,737
Okay, here. Uh, Heisenberg is
pulled over by a police officer.

109
00:04:54,739 --> 00:04:56,239
And the policeman says,

110
00:04:56,241 --> 00:04:58,658
“Did you know you were going
85 miles per hour?”

111
00:04:58,660 --> 00:05:00,243
And Heisenberg says,

112
00:05:00,245 --> 00:05:02,945
“Darn it, now I don't know
where I am.”

113
00:05:05,283 --> 00:05:07,116
So Howard back Monday?
KOOTHRAPPALI: Yeah.

114
00:05:08,953 --> 00:05:09,952
Hey, guys.

115
00:05:09,954 --> 00:05:11,788
Oh, hello.
Hey. Want to join us?

116
00:05:11,790 --> 00:05:15,041
(stammers) But he's a geologist,
and I have more physics jokes.

117
00:05:15,043 --> 00:05:16,626
Oh, quick! Sit!

118
00:05:18,146 --> 00:05:21,180
So, Sheldon says
you have a new girlfriend.

119
00:05:21,182 --> 00:05:23,599
Yeah, which he rudely
announced on my flag show.

120
00:05:23,601 --> 00:05:25,268
People were so
upset about it

121
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:28,471
no one else called in
the rest of the night.

122
00:05:28,473 --> 00:05:30,773
Sorry. I couldn't help myself.

123
00:05:30,775 --> 00:05:32,975
I guess I just love love.

124
00:05:32,977 --> 00:05:35,028
Well, I'm very
happy for you.

125
00:05:35,030 --> 00:05:36,813
Hey, we're all having
dinner tonight.

126
00:05:36,815 --> 00:05:38,147
Why don't the two
of you join us?

127
00:05:38,149 --> 00:05:39,482
Yeah, wh-- Hold on.

128
00:05:39,484 --> 00:05:41,617
We don't know anything
about this woman.

129
00:05:41,619 --> 00:05:42,819
What do you want to know?

130
00:05:42,821 --> 00:05:44,570
Is she a geologist?

131
00:05:44,572 --> 00:05:46,823
No.
Oh, great. See you at 7:00.

132
00:05:49,527 --> 00:05:51,694
(birds chirping)

133
00:05:54,499 --> 00:05:57,199
How about after this
we go see the exotic bird show?

134
00:05:57,201 --> 00:05:58,317
Not a good idea.

135
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:02,455
My hair is a coveted
nesting material.

136
00:06:04,709 --> 00:06:06,709
Learning anything?

137
00:06:06,711 --> 00:06:09,211
Well, sloth babies cling
to their mothers' bodies

138
00:06:09,213 --> 00:06:10,713
for almost a year.

139
00:06:10,715 --> 00:06:12,715
I'm going back to work
after only four months,

140
00:06:12,717 --> 00:06:14,717
so I've learned I hate
myself, I hate sloths,

141
00:06:14,719 --> 00:06:17,903
and I hate you for
bringing me here.

142
00:06:17,905 --> 00:06:22,391
Me I get, but that sloth
is pretty cute.

143
00:06:23,578 --> 00:06:25,745
It's not just the sloth.

144
00:06:25,747 --> 00:06:28,648
Polar bears nurse their cubs
for almost eight months.

145
00:06:28,650 --> 00:06:31,651
The orangutan mother builds her
baby a new home every night.

146
00:06:31,653 --> 00:06:34,820
And what do I do? I choose
my career over my child!

147
00:06:37,692 --> 00:06:40,910
Told you we should
have gone to Legoland.

148
00:06:43,314 --> 00:06:46,349
Can't believe Bert has
a girlfriend and I don't.

149
00:06:46,351 --> 00:06:48,217
I thought you were
taking a break from women

150
00:06:48,219 --> 00:06:49,468
to focus on your career.

151
00:06:49,470 --> 00:06:50,886
Oh, grow up.

152
00:06:52,256 --> 00:06:54,056
(knocking on door)

153
00:06:54,058 --> 00:06:56,425
Don't you have
any friends he can date?

154
00:06:56,427 --> 00:06:58,427
Hey, I already set up
Howard and Bernadette.

155
00:06:58,429 --> 00:07:01,847
It's your turn to ruin
some poor girl's life.

156
00:07:01,849 --> 00:07:03,432
Oh, hey, guys. Come in.

157
00:07:03,434 --> 00:07:04,667
Thanks.

158
00:07:04,669 --> 00:07:05,935
Everyone,

159
00:07:05,937 --> 00:07:07,820
this is Rebecca.
Hi.

160
00:07:07,822 --> 00:07:09,155
AMY/LEONARD/PENNY:
Hey.

161
00:07:09,157 --> 00:07:12,608
She's younger and far more
attractive than he is.

162
00:07:14,128 --> 00:07:17,246
They're copying you two.

163
00:07:20,284 --> 00:07:22,118
What are you making?

164
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:23,452
Chicken.

165
00:07:23,454 --> 00:07:27,089
Birds mess with my hair,
I come back hard.

166
00:07:31,262 --> 00:07:32,762
Finally get Halley down?

167
00:07:32,764 --> 00:07:34,213
Yeah, eventually.

168
00:07:34,215 --> 00:07:36,132
She's still not happy about
taking a bottle, though.

169
00:07:36,134 --> 00:07:38,367
Look, if you're not
ready to go back to work,

170
00:07:38,369 --> 00:07:39,852
we'll figure
something out.

171
00:07:39,854 --> 00:07:41,103
No, I'll be fine.

172
00:07:41,105 --> 00:07:43,139
It might be
good for her.

173
00:07:43,141 --> 00:07:45,141
Howard's mother was around him
all the time,

174
00:07:45,143 --> 00:07:48,861
and he's a world-class
mama's boy.

175
00:07:48,863 --> 00:07:49,979
(scoffs)

176
00:07:49,981 --> 00:07:51,897
I mean, wh-why
would you say that?

177
00:07:51,899 --> 00:07:54,984
Go ahead, have a tantrum;
that'll prove me wrong.

178
00:07:57,572 --> 00:08:00,289
It would be nice to raise Halley
to be a little more independent

179
00:08:00,291 --> 00:08:01,490
than you were.

180
00:08:01,492 --> 00:08:03,075
I guess.

181
00:08:03,077 --> 00:08:05,244
It wasn't until college
that I learned

182
00:08:05,246 --> 00:08:08,130
you can put a thermometer
in your mouth.

183
00:08:11,703 --> 00:08:15,337
On that charming note,
dinner is served.

184
00:08:18,459 --> 00:08:20,926
So is this your first time
dating a scientist?

185
00:08:20,928 --> 00:08:23,312
'Cause I'm thinking of starting
a support group.

186
00:08:24,565 --> 00:08:26,098
Actually, I'm not new to this.

187
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:28,484
I was engaged
to a Scientologist.

188
00:08:33,024 --> 00:08:35,775
(clears throat)
Bert, Rebecca.

189
00:08:35,777 --> 00:08:38,778
I'd like to apologize for my
insensitive comment earlier.

190
00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:40,696
Don't worry about it.
It's fine.

191
00:08:40,698 --> 00:08:42,164
See? It was fine.

192
00:08:42,166 --> 00:08:44,083
I didn't need a time-out.

193
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:48,454
It wasn't a time-out.
Let's get some food.

194
00:08:48,456 --> 00:08:50,873
You made me sit on the stairs
and think about what I did.

195
00:08:50,875 --> 00:08:52,291
Get your food!

196
00:08:54,178 --> 00:08:57,913
So how did you two meet?

197
00:08:57,915 --> 00:08:59,381
Oh, it's such
a cute story.

198
00:08:59,383 --> 00:09:02,017
We met on
a dating Web site.

199
00:09:05,890 --> 00:09:07,790
Is that it?

200
00:09:07,792 --> 00:09:10,893
Oh, sorry. The end.

201
00:09:12,814 --> 00:09:14,063
That's nice.

202
00:09:14,065 --> 00:09:16,565
I haven't had much success
meeting people online.

203
00:09:16,567 --> 00:09:19,652
I didn't either, until
I revamped my profile.

204
00:09:19,654 --> 00:09:22,238
What'd you do,
delete your photo?

205
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:28,744
Go.
Fine.

206
00:09:31,516 --> 00:09:33,415
And don't you slam that door.

207
00:09:33,417 --> 00:09:35,134
Aw, man.

208
00:09:37,004 --> 00:09:38,921
Did I say something wrong?

209
00:09:38,923 --> 00:09:40,756
No, it's always him.

210
00:09:41,976 --> 00:09:45,811
So, Bert, you were telling us
how you updated your profile?

211
00:09:45,813 --> 00:09:48,898
Right. I wasn't getting any
responses, and then I added,

212
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:52,017
“Recent $625,000
MacArthur grant winner”,

213
00:09:52,019 --> 00:09:53,519
and five minutes later,

214
00:09:53,521 --> 00:09:55,905
I met my soul mate.

215
00:10:00,444 --> 00:10:02,945
I was wrong.
You can come back in.

216
00:10:08,178 --> 00:10:10,929
So, Rebecca, how did you become
a personal trainer?

217
00:10:10,931 --> 00:10:13,331
I came to Los Angeles
to be an actress,

218
00:10:13,333 --> 00:10:14,983
and things
didn't really work out.

219
00:10:14,985 --> 00:10:17,936
I'd say she's copying you
again, but...

220
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:22,908
...I'm getting tired
of sitting in the hall.

221
00:10:22,910 --> 00:10:24,860
I'd love a personal trainer.

222
00:10:24,862 --> 00:10:27,245
I haven't seen my abs
since they opened a Shake Shack

223
00:10:27,247 --> 00:10:29,281
on my drive home.

224
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:32,033
I could give you
some free sessions.

225
00:10:32,035 --> 00:10:33,535
Oh, is that offer
for everybody?

226
00:10:33,537 --> 00:10:34,753
(chuckles) Nice try.

227
00:10:34,755 --> 00:10:36,922
I'm not going.

228
00:10:38,926 --> 00:10:40,542
Where's your bathroom?

229
00:10:40,544 --> 00:10:43,495
Mm, just down there.

230
00:10:43,497 --> 00:10:45,881
She's so perfect, sometimes
I think she isn't real.

231
00:10:45,883 --> 00:10:49,184
And then she goes to
the bathroom, and I know she is.

232
00:10:51,054 --> 00:10:53,688
Aw, that's so weird.

233
00:10:53,690 --> 00:10:55,590
AMY:
I'm sorry, Bert,

234
00:10:55,592 --> 00:10:58,310
but aren't you worried she's
only with you for your money?

235
00:10:58,312 --> 00:10:59,945
She better be.
On our first date,

236
00:10:59,947 --> 00:11:02,697
I bought her
an 80-inch flat-screen.

237
00:11:04,234 --> 00:11:05,484
Your first date?

238
00:11:05,486 --> 00:11:07,786
Did you even
measure her walls?

239
00:11:13,744 --> 00:11:14,910
You know, on
our first date,

240
00:11:14,912 --> 00:11:18,413
Leonard used a coupon
to buy me a pretzel.

241
00:11:18,415 --> 00:11:22,083
And we lived
happily ever after.

242
00:11:22,085 --> 00:11:24,252
The end.

243
00:11:26,557 --> 00:11:29,090
Well, guess
I'm ready to go.

244
00:11:29,092 --> 00:11:30,642
Have a great first day back.

245
00:11:30,644 --> 00:11:32,561
You have everything
she needs for day care?

246
00:11:32,563 --> 00:11:34,095
Yep, all in the bag.

247
00:11:34,097 --> 00:11:35,263
Good.

248
00:11:35,265 --> 00:11:36,598
Okay, sweetie,

249
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:39,267
Mommy's gonna go to work now,
so you have fun today.

250
00:11:39,269 --> 00:11:41,069
I told her if day care
is anything like prison,

251
00:11:41,071 --> 00:11:43,839
find the biggest baby
and knock him out.

252
00:11:43,841 --> 00:11:46,741
Bye, cutie.

253
00:11:46,743 --> 00:11:48,944
I'm gonna miss you.

254
00:11:48,946 --> 00:11:51,780
(voice breaking): I'm gonna be
waiting right here tonight

255
00:11:51,782 --> 00:11:53,615
when you get home.

256
00:11:55,452 --> 00:11:58,203
Stop, you're gonna
make me cry.

257
00:11:58,205 --> 00:12:00,789
(voice breaking):
Great, now everybody's crying.

258
00:12:00,791 --> 00:12:02,040
(clears throat)

259
00:12:02,042 --> 00:12:03,458
At least Halley's not.

260
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:04,876
That's good. (chuckles)

261
00:12:04,878 --> 00:12:07,929
She's not gonna see us all day,
and she doesn't even care!

262
00:12:10,968 --> 00:12:13,134
Who's ready to laugh?
(groans)

263
00:12:13,136 --> 00:12:14,686
Okay. So...

264
00:12:14,688 --> 00:12:18,223
Feynman, Einstein
and Schrodinger walk into a bar.

265
00:12:18,225 --> 00:12:19,774
Feynman says,

266
00:12:19,776 --> 00:12:21,977
“It appears
we're inside a joke.”

267
00:12:21,979 --> 00:12:24,696
Einstein replies,
“But only to an observer

268
00:12:24,698 --> 00:12:26,681
who saw us walk in
simultaneously.”

269
00:12:26,683 --> 00:12:28,400
To which
Schrodinger says,

270
00:12:28,402 --> 00:12:31,653
“If someone's looking
in the window, I'm leaving.”

271
00:12:33,824 --> 00:12:36,908
(chuckles) That's
actually funny.

272
00:12:38,712 --> 00:12:41,663
You should send that
to Jimmy Fallon.

273
00:12:42,833 --> 00:12:43,915
Hey.

274
00:12:43,917 --> 00:12:45,834
Oh, hello. Join us.
Hey. Yeah.

275
00:12:45,836 --> 00:12:48,503
Hey, sorry if last night
was awkward.

276
00:12:48,505 --> 00:12:49,888
Actually, it got me thinking

277
00:12:49,890 --> 00:12:52,340
that I shouldn't flaunt my money
to find love.

278
00:12:52,342 --> 00:12:54,192
I might break up with Rebecca.

279
00:12:54,194 --> 00:12:56,011
Wow, that's a big step.

280
00:12:56,013 --> 00:12:57,979
I think it shows
a lot of character.

281
00:12:57,981 --> 00:13:00,098
I'm gonna hold out
and see if I can find

282
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:02,350
a hot young blonde
who likes me for me.

283
00:13:02,352 --> 00:13:04,853
(laughs):
That's a good one.

284
00:13:08,442 --> 00:13:10,692
Okay, now, Leonard,
you tell a joke.

285
00:13:14,748 --> 00:13:16,364
BERNADETTE:
How's she doing?

286
00:13:16,366 --> 00:13:18,333
She's great. Look.

287
00:13:18,335 --> 00:13:20,669
I see a wall...

288
00:13:20,671 --> 00:13:22,037
floor...

289
00:13:22,039 --> 00:13:24,039
some Asian baby...

290
00:13:24,041 --> 00:13:25,707
There she is.

291
00:13:25,709 --> 00:13:27,926
See? Nothing to worry about.

292
00:13:27,928 --> 00:13:29,461
Thank you.

293
00:13:29,463 --> 00:13:31,096
Okay, I'm gonna try
and get some work done.

294
00:13:31,098 --> 00:13:33,131
Yeah, me, too. Love you.

295
00:13:33,133 --> 00:13:35,016
Love you, too. Bye.

296
00:13:35,018 --> 00:13:36,885
(phone beeps)

297
00:13:37,788 --> 00:13:39,938
(sighs)

298
00:13:42,109 --> 00:13:43,858
STUART: How is she?
(screams)

299
00:13:48,148 --> 00:13:49,614
What are you doing here?

300
00:13:49,616 --> 00:13:52,200
Can't a guy hang out
at a college he doesn't go to

301
00:13:52,202 --> 00:13:54,452
and stare at a baby
that isn't his?

302
00:13:54,454 --> 00:13:57,288
I get it.

303
00:13:57,290 --> 00:14:00,492
I haven't even made
it to my office yet.

304
00:14:00,494 --> 00:14:03,411
(both chuckle)

305
00:14:03,413 --> 00:14:06,164
(both sigh)

306
00:14:06,166 --> 00:14:09,634
Is it weird if we just stand
here and watch her all day?

307
00:14:09,636 --> 00:14:11,836
Probably.

308
00:14:14,091 --> 00:14:15,724
We should go.

309
00:14:15,726 --> 00:14:16,808
Yeah.

310
00:14:16,810 --> 00:14:19,094
(exhales)

311
00:14:19,096 --> 00:14:21,596
Or we could take her
to the aquarium.

312
00:14:21,598 --> 00:14:23,732
I'll get her,
you grab her bag.

313
00:14:23,734 --> 00:14:27,402
Hang on, Halley,
we're busting you out of there!

314
00:14:29,606 --> 00:14:32,023
What are you looking at?

315
00:14:32,025 --> 00:14:34,159
Comments from our <i>Behind</i>
<i>the Flags</i> retrospective.

316
00:14:34,161 --> 00:14:35,860
Get this, people
are calling it

317
00:14:35,862 --> 00:14:39,197
“the longest one yet”"

318
00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:40,632
(knocking on door)

319
00:14:40,634 --> 00:14:42,517
BERT:
Hello? Anybody home?

320
00:14:42,519 --> 00:14:43,585
Is that Bert?

321
00:14:43,587 --> 00:14:44,652
BERT:
It's Bert.

322
00:14:44,654 --> 00:14:47,122
I think it's Bert.

323
00:14:48,008 --> 00:14:49,958
Hey, what's up?

324
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:51,760
I broke up with Rebecca.

325
00:14:51,762 --> 00:14:53,094
Oh.
AMY: Oh.

326
00:14:53,096 --> 00:14:54,679
You know, good for you.

327
00:14:54,681 --> 00:14:56,881
No, I miss her.

328
00:14:56,883 --> 00:14:58,917
I don't know why
I listened to you.

329
00:14:58,919 --> 00:15:01,136
He's not wrong.

330
00:15:02,856 --> 00:15:06,107
It was your crackpot idea
that he deserves love.

331
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:09,444
You know, you need to start
raising your hand

332
00:15:09,446 --> 00:15:10,612
before you speak.

333
00:15:12,833 --> 00:15:14,649
Yes, starting now.

334
00:15:16,403 --> 00:15:17,986
Bert, you're a good guy;
you deserve a woman

335
00:15:17,988 --> 00:15:19,988
who's interested in
more than just your money.

336
00:15:19,990 --> 00:15:21,990
She was also interested
in walking around my house

337
00:15:21,992 --> 00:15:23,124
in her underwear.

338
00:15:23,126 --> 00:15:26,478
Now the only one
doing that is me.

339
00:15:28,381 --> 00:15:31,666
If you're that upset,
go get her back.

340
00:15:31,668 --> 00:15:32,717
I tried.

341
00:15:32,719 --> 00:15:34,502
She's not answering my calls.

342
00:15:34,504 --> 00:15:37,922
Which really hurts
because I bought her that phone.

343
00:15:39,342 --> 00:15:41,559
I made a huge mistake.

344
00:15:41,561 --> 00:15:42,977
No, you didn't.

345
00:15:42,979 --> 00:15:45,313
Okay? Look, Bert,
when I had money,

346
00:15:45,315 --> 00:15:47,682
I dated lots of girls
who weren't right for me.

347
00:15:47,684 --> 00:15:49,234
And then I gave
up my money,

348
00:15:49,236 --> 00:15:51,352
and now I'm alone and
living with my friends,

349
00:15:51,354 --> 00:15:55,006
and somebody else should
probably talk now.

350
00:15:56,593 --> 00:15:58,359
Look, sweetie,

351
00:15:58,361 --> 00:16:00,078
relationships
aren't about money, okay?

352
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:02,163
It's about respect
and having things in common

353
00:16:02,165 --> 00:16:03,715
and...

354
00:16:03,717 --> 00:16:05,200
Yes, Sheldon?

355
00:16:05,202 --> 00:16:07,035
You and Leonard
don't have anything in common.

356
00:16:07,037 --> 00:16:09,120
Maybe you should break up.

357
00:16:10,674 --> 00:16:12,507
You called on him.

358
00:16:16,746 --> 00:16:19,214
(singsongy):
Guess who's home from day care?

359
00:16:20,884 --> 00:16:22,967
It's Halley.

360
00:16:22,969 --> 00:16:24,185
Unless somebody else put an “X”

361
00:16:24,187 --> 00:16:26,888
on the bottom
of their kid's foot.

362
00:16:26,890 --> 00:16:29,557
You realize they called
when you took her.

363
00:16:32,229 --> 00:16:36,064
(singsongy): Guess who's
home from the aquarium?

364
00:16:38,919 --> 00:16:40,785
BERT: Sorry again
for barging in.

365
00:16:40,787 --> 00:16:42,737
You don't have to go.
You're welcome to hang with us.

366
00:16:42,739 --> 00:16:45,740
Actually, our friendship
group is at capacity.

367
00:16:45,742 --> 00:16:49,577
But if anybody drops out,
you're at the top of the list.

368
00:16:51,131 --> 00:16:52,413
Unless it's Raj,

369
00:16:52,415 --> 00:16:55,567
in which case, we'll probably
get a person of color.

370
00:16:58,271 --> 00:17:00,471
You guys are nice,
but I'm just gonna

371
00:17:00,473 --> 00:17:04,425
buy Rebecca a Jet Ski
and see if that gets her back.

372
00:17:04,427 --> 00:17:07,562
I feel bad for Bert.

373
00:17:07,564 --> 00:17:09,981
So he's using his money
to attract a mate.

374
00:17:09,983 --> 00:17:12,100
Is that any different
than me using my intelligence

375
00:17:12,102 --> 00:17:13,318
to attract Amy?

376
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:16,604
Or Leonard using his power
of groveling to get Penny?

377
00:17:18,108 --> 00:17:19,324
It's totally different.

378
00:17:19,326 --> 00:17:20,575
Bert's money might run out,

379
00:17:20,577 --> 00:17:23,111
but I can beg
until the end of time.

380
00:17:24,865 --> 00:17:28,449
All that
<i>and</i> he's shorter than me.

381
00:17:30,754 --> 00:17:34,455
Sheldon, what did Amy have
that attracted you?

382
00:17:34,457 --> 00:17:36,307
Oh, so many things.

383
00:17:36,309 --> 00:17:38,877
Her mind, her kindness,

384
00:17:38,879 --> 00:17:41,713
and especially her body.

385
00:17:41,715 --> 00:17:42,797
Really?

386
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:44,832
Relax.
We're the same blood type.

387
00:17:44,834 --> 00:17:47,969
He knew he could
harvest an organ.

388
00:17:56,848 --> 00:17:58,598
She does look happy.

389
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:01,134
See? This is
the right thing for her.

390
00:18:01,136 --> 00:18:03,403
Let's all just
go to work.

391
00:18:03,405 --> 00:18:05,071
(sighs)

392
00:18:09,227 --> 00:18:11,277
Anytime.

393
00:18:11,279 --> 00:18:14,664
Let me just say good-bye.

394
00:18:15,534 --> 00:18:18,501
Halley. Look at Mommy.

395
00:18:19,338 --> 00:18:21,204
Over here, honey.

396
00:18:23,208 --> 00:18:24,958
Say good-bye to Mommy!

397
00:18:25,844 --> 00:18:27,293
Look at me!

398
00:18:27,295 --> 00:18:29,346
Look at your mother!

399
00:18:29,348 --> 00:18:32,432
(babies crying)

400
00:18:32,434 --> 00:18:34,551
All right, we can go.

401
00:18:37,806 --> 00:18:39,155
Hello.

402
00:18:39,157 --> 00:18:40,724
I'm Dr. Sheldon Cooper.

403
00:18:40,726 --> 00:18:42,659
And I'm
Dr. Amy Farrah Fowler.

404
00:18:42,661 --> 00:18:44,227
Based on the
glowing reception

405
00:18:44,229 --> 00:18:46,763
of our recent <i>Behind</i>
<i>the Flags</i> retrospective,

406
00:18:46,765 --> 00:18:49,666
we thought you might like to
see how it all came together.

407
00:18:49,668 --> 00:18:53,069
So welcome
to tonight's episode...

408
00:18:53,071 --> 00:18:54,471
BOTH:
<i>Fun with Flags:</i>

409
00:18:54,473 --> 00:18:56,456
<i>Behind the</i>
<i>Behind the Flags:</i>

410
00:18:56,458 --> 00:18:58,625
<i>A Retrospective Retrospective.</i>

411
00:19:00,729 --> 00:19:02,796
Ooh, we already have
our first call.

412
00:19:02,798 --> 00:19:04,330
Oh.

413
00:19:04,332 --> 00:19:07,000
Hello, you're on
<i>Fun with Flags.</i>

414
00:19:07,002 --> 00:19:08,952
BERT: The Jet Ski worked.
I got her back.
