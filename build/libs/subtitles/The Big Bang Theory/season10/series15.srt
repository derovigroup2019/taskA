1
00:00:03,217 --> 00:00:06,986
Okay, I'm zeroing out the
electro-osmotic flow rate

2
00:00:06,988 --> 00:00:09,255
in the micro-fluidic channel.

3
00:00:09,257 --> 00:00:11,323
Nicely done, Howard.

4
00:00:11,325 --> 00:00:13,893
Well, my wife is four-foot-ten
and sexually satisfied,

5
00:00:13,895 --> 00:00:16,829
so clearly I know my way
around tiny things.

6
00:00:16,831 --> 00:00:19,798
Good for you, on the cutting
edge of new technology

7
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:21,634
and still making
inappropriate comments

8
00:00:21,636 --> 00:00:23,969
about the mother of your child.

9
00:00:23,971 --> 00:00:27,773
Those are just the things
I say out loud.

10
00:00:27,775 --> 00:00:29,909
Gentlemen, we need to stop
immediately.

11
00:00:29,911 --> 00:00:30,976
What's wrong?

12
00:00:30,978 --> 00:00:32,111
I'm looking at the math,

13
00:00:32,113 --> 00:00:33,579
and I think we can
make the device

14
00:00:33,581 --> 00:00:36,682
between eight and
ten percent smaller.

15
00:00:36,684 --> 00:00:39,618
That's great, but the
Air Force approved the specs.

16
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:40,686
We're good to go.

17
00:00:40,688 --> 00:00:42,288
Yeah. It doesn't
need to be smaller.

18
00:00:42,290 --> 00:00:44,056
Shame on you.

19
00:00:45,226 --> 00:00:48,227
Where would we be if poodle
breeders had that attitude?

20
00:00:48,229 --> 00:00:50,095
I'll tell you.

21
00:00:50,097 --> 00:00:52,031
We would have the standard
and the miniature poodle,

22
00:00:52,033 --> 00:00:53,299
but no toy or teacup.

23
00:00:53,301 --> 00:00:54,733
Which by the way,

24
00:00:54,735 --> 00:00:56,902
is not an officially
recognized breed,

25
00:00:56,904 --> 00:00:58,671
but that's just poodle politics.

26
00:00:58,673 --> 00:01:01,573
Can we please stop
talking about poodles?

27
00:01:01,575 --> 00:01:04,109
Fine. Candy bars.

28
00:01:04,111 --> 00:01:06,879
Now, do you enjoy a fun size?
I know you do.

29
00:01:06,881 --> 00:01:09,315
Sheldon, we don't need
to make this smaller.

30
00:01:09,317 --> 00:01:10,983
Your work is done.
Go home.

31
00:01:10,985 --> 00:01:12,851
I don't want to go home.

32
00:01:12,853 --> 00:01:14,320
Fine, go for a little walk.

33
00:01:14,322 --> 00:01:15,487
Then what?

34
00:01:15,489 --> 00:01:17,323
Just keep walking.

35
00:01:18,392 --> 00:01:21,794
? Our whole universe
was in a hot, dense state ?

36
00:01:21,796 --> 00:01:25,164
? Then nearly 14 billion years
ago expansion started... Wait! ?

37
00:01:25,166 --> 00:01:26,966
? The Earth began to cool ?

38
00:01:26,968 --> 00:01:29,835
? The autotrophs began to drool,
Neanderthals developed tools ?

39
00:01:29,837 --> 00:01:31,704
? We built the Wall ?
? <i>We built the pyramids</i> ?

40
00:01:31,706 --> 00:01:34,740
? Math, Science, History,
unraveling the mystery ?

41
00:01:34,742 --> 00:01:36,575
? That all started
with a big bang ?

42
00:01:36,577 --> 00:01:37,352
? <i>Bang!</i> ?

43
00:01:37,353 --> 00:01:41,353

45
00:01:47,355 --> 00:01:51,057
At least it's quiet
when he takes bathroom breaks.

46
00:01:51,059 --> 00:01:52,625
I know.

47
00:01:52,627 --> 00:01:56,495
That's why I keep refilling
his water when he's not looking.

48
00:01:56,497 --> 00:01:58,564
You're kidding.

49
00:01:58,566 --> 00:02:00,933
I don't care if we're in
a drought, it's worth it.

50
00:02:02,737 --> 00:02:06,605
You know, I-I do have a way
to get him out of our hair.

51
00:02:06,607 --> 00:02:09,041
I've been holding onto this
for a few years,

52
00:02:09,043 --> 00:02:11,010
but maybe now's the time.

53
00:02:11,012 --> 00:02:14,980
W-We can just lock the door;
you don't have to kill him.

54
00:02:14,982 --> 00:02:19,151
You can't kill him; he'll just
respawn at the last save point.

55
00:02:20,288 --> 00:02:24,056
Oh, that was my sixth trip
to the bathroom.

56
00:02:24,058 --> 00:02:26,358
As long as that's not
a urinary tract infection,

57
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:28,894
that's a personal best.

58
00:02:28,896 --> 00:02:31,263
Hey, uh, buddy,
I got you a little present.

59
00:02:31,265 --> 00:02:32,631
Really?

60
00:02:32,633 --> 00:02:34,166
Yeah. Go ahead, open it.

61
00:02:37,004 --> 00:02:38,904
"Congratulations.

62
00:02:38,906 --> 00:02:41,841
"The bearer of this
certificate is entitled

63
00:02:41,843 --> 00:02:45,277
"to the ultimate
train experience

64
00:02:45,279 --> 00:02:47,947
"at The Nevada
Northern Railway.

65
00:02:47,949 --> 00:02:49,949
"You are at the throttle.

66
00:02:49,951 --> 00:02:52,785
"You are the engineer.

67
00:02:52,787 --> 00:02:55,287
You are running
the locomotive."

68
00:02:58,426 --> 00:03:00,693
This doesn't
happen very often,

69
00:03:00,695 --> 00:03:02,561
but here comes a hug.

70
00:03:06,501 --> 00:03:08,968
Oh, dear! I have
to tinkle again!

71
00:03:14,242 --> 00:03:17,009
Okay. Where were we?

72
00:03:18,279 --> 00:03:20,379
For Howie's occupation,

73
00:03:20,381 --> 00:03:22,548
should I include
that he was an astronaut?

74
00:03:22,550 --> 00:03:25,551
Well, he mentioned it in
his mother's eulogy, so why not?

75
00:03:26,454 --> 00:03:27,853
I can't believe you
have to fill out

76
00:03:27,855 --> 00:03:29,555
a preschool application
for an infant.

77
00:03:29,557 --> 00:03:31,790
Uh, the one at Caltech
has a crazy wait list.

78
00:03:31,792 --> 00:03:33,592
I warned you,
a lot of people apply

79
00:03:33,594 --> 00:03:35,394
when they're still pregnant.
Well, I didn't.

80
00:03:35,396 --> 00:03:39,732
I also skipped a birthing class
to see <i>Zootopia,</i> so back off.

81
00:03:39,734 --> 00:03:41,333
Whoa. Just trying to help.

82
00:03:41,335 --> 00:03:44,570
Sorry. Howie's back at work and
there's just so much going on.

83
00:03:44,572 --> 00:03:46,405
Is there anything
we can do?

84
00:03:46,407 --> 00:03:48,240
Sure. Open up a college fund,

85
00:03:48,242 --> 00:03:50,543
shop for life insurance,
and in the laundry room,

86
00:03:50,545 --> 00:03:52,311
there's a mountain
of dirty laundry.

87
00:03:52,313 --> 00:03:55,147
Wash it or burn in, your choice.

88
00:03:56,150 --> 00:03:58,184
(Halley crying over monitor)
Ugh, be right back.

89
00:03:58,186 --> 00:04:00,352
No, no. I will
take care of it.

90
00:04:00,354 --> 00:04:01,520
Oh, thank you.

91
00:04:01,522 --> 00:04:03,022
While I'm gone,
you can think about

92
00:04:03,024 --> 00:04:04,623
how mean you were to me.

93
00:04:04,625 --> 00:04:06,592
All right,
you know what you need?

94
00:04:06,594 --> 00:04:08,127
A night away from all of this.

95
00:04:08,129 --> 00:04:10,329
You know, where you can just
kind of relax and...

96
00:04:10,331 --> 00:04:11,797
(Halley continues crying
over monitor)

97
00:04:11,799 --> 00:04:14,433
I'm just gonna... turn this off.

98
00:04:14,435 --> 00:04:15,968
(Halley continues crying nearby)

99
00:04:18,372 --> 00:04:20,839
Much better. (clears throat)

100
00:04:21,742 --> 00:04:22,808
Seriously, let's plan a night,

101
00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:24,076
you know, give you a break.

102
00:04:24,078 --> 00:04:25,177
We could go dancing.

103
00:04:25,179 --> 00:04:27,613
That sounds really nice.
AMY: Oh.

104
00:04:27,615 --> 00:04:30,282
All this week, the Early
Music Society of Pasadena

105
00:04:30,284 --> 00:04:31,684
is doing a joint concert

106
00:04:31,686 --> 00:04:34,653
with the San Gabriel
Renaissance Choir.

107
00:04:35,623 --> 00:04:37,823
Okay, that's
the one to beat.

108
00:04:37,825 --> 00:04:39,692
Good luck.

109
00:04:39,694 --> 00:04:42,761
People have been saying that
for 600 years.

110
00:04:47,335 --> 00:04:48,534
Hey, you're home early.

111
00:04:48,536 --> 00:04:50,369
You'll never believe it.

112
00:04:50,371 --> 00:04:52,471
Leonard gave me
the most incredible gift,

113
00:04:52,473 --> 00:04:54,440
a trip to a historic railway,

114
00:04:54,442 --> 00:04:57,977
and I get to operate
an actual locomotive.

115
00:04:57,979 --> 00:05:00,779
Wow. He finally used it.

116
00:05:00,781 --> 00:05:03,249
What'd you do?

117
00:05:03,251 --> 00:05:04,617
No idea.

118
00:05:04,619 --> 00:05:07,052
All I know is I'm gonna be
working on the railroad

119
00:05:07,054 --> 00:05:09,021
all the livelong day.

120
00:05:09,023 --> 00:05:11,523
Well, I'm really happy for you.

121
00:05:11,525 --> 00:05:12,858
Oh, no. It's not just me. No.

122
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:15,661
The railway is four hours
from the nearest airport,

123
00:05:15,663 --> 00:05:17,162
and guess who gets to drive me.

124
00:05:17,164 --> 00:05:18,597
I give up.

125
00:05:18,599 --> 00:05:19,498
You!

126
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:21,433
No. I really give up.

127
00:05:21,435 --> 00:05:24,203
Oh, oh. And guess
where we get to sleep?

128
00:05:24,205 --> 00:05:25,971
Our choice of
a turn-of-the-century

129
00:05:25,973 --> 00:05:27,239
railway bunkhouse

130
00:05:27,241 --> 00:05:29,308
or a working caboose.

131
00:05:29,310 --> 00:05:31,810
Now, the problem with a caboose
is there's no bathroom,

132
00:05:31,812 --> 00:05:35,547
but the problem with the
bunkhouse is it's not a caboose.

133
00:05:36,350 --> 00:05:38,017
On the first day,

134
00:05:38,019 --> 00:05:40,085
I get to drive
a steam engine.

135
00:05:40,087 --> 00:05:42,521
Oh, and the second day,
a diesel engine.

136
00:05:42,523 --> 00:05:43,555
Oh, and

137
00:05:43,557 --> 00:05:45,491
if I volunteer to do
track maintenance

138
00:05:45,493 --> 00:05:48,360
and paperwork, they'll let me
stay as long as I want.

139
00:05:49,096 --> 00:05:50,329
So you might want to pack

140
00:05:50,331 --> 00:05:52,431
enough clothes
for the rest of our lives.

141
00:05:53,534 --> 00:05:56,368
Can I pee now?

142
00:05:56,370 --> 00:05:59,471
Oh, get this!

143
00:05:59,473 --> 00:06:04,109
I get to take a test
based on a 125-page manual.

144
00:06:04,111 --> 00:06:07,146
I get to learn things
like hand signals. Ooh.

145
00:06:07,148 --> 00:06:09,982
There's forward, uh, reverse,

146
00:06:09,984 --> 00:06:11,583
set the brakes.

147
00:06:11,585 --> 00:06:12,951
Are you done yet?

148
00:06:12,953 --> 00:06:15,888
You're missing
some great stuff out here.

149
00:06:15,890 --> 00:06:18,457
Oh, this is good.

150
00:06:19,727 --> 00:06:21,827
There are dozens of
railroad crossings

151
00:06:21,829 --> 00:06:23,796
you have to blow
the whistle for.

152
00:06:23,798 --> 00:06:26,231
But that is the figurative
you, not the literal you.

153
00:06:26,233 --> 00:06:28,100
I'll be blowing
the whistle.

154
00:06:29,036 --> 00:06:32,604
Amy, get up. It's
time to go to work.

155
00:06:32,606 --> 00:06:33,872
(groans)

156
00:06:35,042 --> 00:06:37,476
This train thing worked out
better than I thought.

157
00:06:37,478 --> 00:06:39,545
He's home studying
the engineer's manual.

158
00:06:39,547 --> 00:06:41,447
(sighs)

159
00:06:41,449 --> 00:06:43,349
It's so peaceful
without him here.

160
00:06:43,351 --> 00:06:45,417
Can I ask you
how much that cost?

161
00:06:45,419 --> 00:06:47,820
$4,000-- worth every penny.

162
00:06:47,822 --> 00:06:48,787
(knock on door)

163
00:06:48,789 --> 00:06:50,255
Gentlemen.

164
00:06:50,257 --> 00:06:51,323
Colonel Williams.
Sir.

165
00:06:51,325 --> 00:06:52,424
Just wanted to see how

166
00:06:52,426 --> 00:06:53,659
the guidance system's
coming along.

167
00:06:53,661 --> 00:06:54,960
Great. We found
a cooling solution

168
00:06:54,962 --> 00:06:57,196
that allowed us to get
the size of the prototype

169
00:06:57,198 --> 00:06:59,164
down to the target specs.

170
00:06:59,166 --> 00:07:01,633
As a cooling solution,
it's pretty cool.

171
00:07:01,635 --> 00:07:02,835
(chuckles)

172
00:07:02,837 --> 00:07:04,770
Don't do that.

173
00:07:07,141 --> 00:07:08,307
What's this?

174
00:07:08,309 --> 00:07:10,342
Oh, nothing.
Just some math we don't need.

175
00:07:10,344 --> 00:07:11,744
This is a different approach.

176
00:07:11,746 --> 00:07:14,747
Are you trying to get the
guidance system even smaller?

177
00:07:14,749 --> 00:07:16,782
It's just a theory.

178
00:07:16,784 --> 00:07:18,450
Uh, it's not even worked out.

179
00:07:18,452 --> 00:07:20,619
Oh. (chuckles)

180
00:07:20,621 --> 00:07:22,354
I want this.

181
00:07:23,324 --> 00:07:26,325
But we've already met
the agreed upon specs.

182
00:07:26,327 --> 00:07:28,794
Going smaller would
require weeks' worth

183
00:07:28,796 --> 00:07:30,262
of new computations.

184
00:07:30,264 --> 00:07:33,565
So get the kid with
the two shirts to do it.

185
00:07:34,969 --> 00:07:37,870
Sir, uh, i-if I may,
uh, we've put a lot

186
00:07:37,872 --> 00:07:41,039
of thought and effort into
this current prototype.

187
00:07:41,041 --> 00:07:42,908
It's a really
elegant solution,

188
00:07:42,910 --> 00:07:44,777
and most importantly,
it works.

189
00:07:45,579 --> 00:07:47,112
Yeah, I want this.

190
00:07:48,516 --> 00:07:49,848
But that's just a theory.

191
00:07:49,850 --> 00:07:51,350
It's not even a
complete thought.

192
00:07:51,352 --> 00:07:53,419
You both make excellent points.

193
00:07:53,421 --> 00:07:55,220
And thank you for
presenting it so articulately.

194
00:07:55,222 --> 00:07:57,456
(chuckles) Make this.

195
00:08:00,728 --> 00:08:02,561
(door closes)

196
00:08:02,563 --> 00:08:06,131
The kid with the two
shirts screwed us again.

197
00:08:07,234 --> 00:08:10,436
All right. You guys
ready to get crazy?

198
00:08:10,438 --> 00:08:13,305
Well, the bra
under here ain't beige.

199
00:08:13,307 --> 00:08:15,174
KOOTHRAPPALI:
Okay.

200
00:08:15,176 --> 00:08:17,309
You ladies
have fun tonight.

201
00:08:17,311 --> 00:08:19,745
Don't worry about Halley.
Uncle Stuart's on the job.

202
00:08:19,747 --> 00:08:22,781
Under the careful supervision
of her godfather.

203
00:08:22,783 --> 00:08:26,618
My apologies. I didn't mean
to offend you, Don Corleone.

204
00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:29,087
Like I said,
you ladies have fun.

205
00:08:29,089 --> 00:08:31,490
We will. Got my dancing shoes,
got my breast pump.

206
00:08:31,492 --> 00:08:33,091
Let's party.

207
00:08:33,093 --> 00:08:34,927
You know, if you
pump at the bar,

208
00:08:34,929 --> 00:08:37,095
I promise we'll
get free drinks.

209
00:08:37,097 --> 00:08:38,797
Call if there's any problems.

210
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:40,466
No. She's busy.
You call Howard.

211
00:08:40,468 --> 00:08:41,333
Got it.

212
00:08:41,335 --> 00:08:44,002
Call me. Don't call Howard.

213
00:08:44,004 --> 00:08:46,104
I would never call Howard.

214
00:08:48,008 --> 00:08:50,375
Okay, instead of
arguing all night,

215
00:08:50,377 --> 00:08:52,044
let's just split up
the baby chores.

216
00:08:52,046 --> 00:08:54,480
Yeah, great. Um, I'll put
food in her top half,

217
00:08:54,482 --> 00:08:56,815
you deal with whatever
comes out the bottom.

218
00:08:59,787 --> 00:09:02,187
I can't believe we
have to ask Sheldon

219
00:09:02,189 --> 00:09:03,755
to come back
and help us.

220
00:09:03,757 --> 00:09:04,756
Oh, boo-hoo.

221
00:09:04,758 --> 00:09:06,391
I spent four grand on a gift

222
00:09:06,393 --> 00:09:09,194
that only got rid of him
for an afternoon.

223
00:09:10,631 --> 00:09:12,831
(electrical crackling)

224
00:09:15,903 --> 00:09:17,436
What is that?

225
00:09:17,438 --> 00:09:19,171
I don't know,
but if he yells,

226
00:09:19,173 --> 00:09:22,040
"It's alive," we run.

227
00:09:28,649 --> 00:09:30,015
Oh, hey.

228
00:09:30,017 --> 00:09:31,783
If you knocked,
I couldn't hear you.

229
00:09:31,785 --> 00:09:33,719
I'm welding
this locomotive engine.

230
00:09:35,589 --> 00:09:38,590
And if you didn't knock,
how about some manners?

231
00:09:40,027 --> 00:09:42,394
How'd you even get
that up the stairs?

232
00:09:42,396 --> 00:09:45,564
I said to myself,
"I think I can, I think I can."

233
00:09:47,334 --> 00:09:49,902
And then I couldn't, so...

234
00:09:49,904 --> 00:09:53,872
I paid two men who promised
not to come rob us later.

235
00:09:53,874 --> 00:09:56,008
Okay, look, Sheldon,
the Colonel wants us

236
00:09:56,010 --> 00:09:57,643
to make the guidance system
smaller,

237
00:09:57,645 --> 00:09:59,444
and we can't
do it without you.

238
00:09:59,446 --> 00:10:01,246
Interesting.

239
00:10:01,248 --> 00:10:03,215
Well, so I was right.

240
00:10:03,217 --> 00:10:06,418
Open a window. It's about
to get smug in here.

241
00:10:07,922 --> 00:10:09,354
Well, I would love to help you,

242
00:10:09,356 --> 00:10:11,290
but since I discovered
the satisfaction

243
00:10:11,292 --> 00:10:13,792
of working with my hands
on a train engine,

244
00:10:13,794 --> 00:10:15,894
I don't think
I can go back to theory.

245
00:10:16,497 --> 00:10:18,697
I'm an engineer now.

246
00:10:19,533 --> 00:10:21,166
And, hey,
just to be clear,

247
00:10:21,168 --> 00:10:23,435
a train engineer.

248
00:10:24,738 --> 00:10:27,272
Not that goofy kind you are.

249
00:10:36,945 --> 00:10:39,379
Sheldon, you can still go
on the trip in a few weeks.

250
00:10:39,381 --> 00:10:40,580
Just help us out.

251
00:10:40,582 --> 00:10:42,382
Sorry. I need to work
on this engine

252
00:10:42,384 --> 00:10:45,685
so when I get to the train yard
I won't look foolish.

253
00:10:45,687 --> 00:10:46,819
(laughs)

254
00:10:46,821 --> 00:10:48,287
He's worried about
looking foolish.

255
00:10:48,289 --> 00:10:50,957
That's a heapin' helping
of irony right there.

256
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,293
Come on, you know
you're not leaving physics.

257
00:10:54,295 --> 00:10:55,428
Why are you doing this?

258
00:10:55,430 --> 00:10:59,766
Leonard, in the world
of theoretical physics,

259
00:10:59,768 --> 00:11:02,535
you never finish;
so much is unprovable.

260
00:11:02,537 --> 00:11:03,770
But when I was studying

261
00:11:03,772 --> 00:11:06,739
that railway guide,
it was so tangible

262
00:11:06,741 --> 00:11:10,443
and so satisfying
that something just clicked.

263
00:11:10,445 --> 00:11:12,478
Then it clacked.

264
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:13,813
Then it clicked,

265
00:11:13,815 --> 00:11:16,816
then it clacked, click-clack
clickety-clack, and here we are.

266
00:11:16,818 --> 00:11:19,519
(imitates train whistle):
Whoo-whoo!

267
00:11:22,157 --> 00:11:24,757
Did you hear anything back
from the Caltech preschool?

268
00:11:24,759 --> 00:11:27,427
Not yet, but we're gonna apply
to a bunch of others

269
00:11:27,429 --> 00:11:28,861
just to keep our options open.

270
00:11:28,863 --> 00:11:30,596
Okay, stop that!
No more preschool talk.

271
00:11:30,598 --> 00:11:31,931
Tonight is about
having fun.

272
00:11:31,933 --> 00:11:34,901
Nothing says fun
like being scolded.

273
00:11:34,903 --> 00:11:37,870
(ringtone playing)

274
00:11:37,872 --> 00:11:39,439
It's Raj.

275
00:11:39,441 --> 00:11:40,973
Everything okay?

276
00:11:40,975 --> 00:11:44,343
Don't worry. Everything's fine.

277
00:11:44,345 --> 00:11:46,846
Hang up!
We don't need help.

278
00:11:46,848 --> 00:11:49,215
I don't need your help
deciding when we need help!

279
00:11:51,086 --> 00:11:52,385
Raj, what's going on?

280
00:11:52,387 --> 00:11:53,653
Yes, so,

281
00:11:53,655 --> 00:11:56,289
I was just warming up
some milk for Halley,

282
00:11:56,291 --> 00:11:58,291
and I-I thought
it smelled a little funky,

283
00:11:58,293 --> 00:12:01,094
so I checked the date
that you wrote on the bottle,

284
00:12:01,096 --> 00:12:02,995
and it says "Flerbsday."

285
00:12:02,997 --> 00:12:05,431
It says "Tuesday."

286
00:12:05,433 --> 00:12:07,333
How is that a "T"?!

287
00:12:08,536 --> 00:12:10,903
I'm sure it's fine,
but if you're worried,

288
00:12:10,905 --> 00:12:12,371
there's extra milk
in the freezer.

289
00:12:12,373 --> 00:12:13,673
Okay, yes,

290
00:12:13,675 --> 00:12:15,742
I will err
on the side of caution

291
00:12:15,744 --> 00:12:17,877
and defrost a fresh batch.

292
00:12:17,879 --> 00:12:19,879
You're wasting
perfectly good milk.

293
00:12:19,881 --> 00:12:22,148
Fine, you drink it.
It's just milk.

294
00:12:22,150 --> 00:12:24,016
Stuart, don't you drink my milk!

295
00:12:25,653 --> 00:12:26,886
Okay, give--

296
00:12:26,888 --> 00:12:28,755
Can you guys
handle this or not?

297
00:12:28,757 --> 00:12:31,891
Oh, of course we can.
Uh, you girls have a good time.

298
00:12:31,893 --> 00:12:32,892
(chuckles)

299
00:12:32,894 --> 00:12:35,595
She said I was in charge.

300
00:12:36,464 --> 00:12:38,898
Hmm.

301
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:40,399
So we just
throw this away?

302
00:12:40,401 --> 00:12:42,068
What else are you
gonna do with it?

303
00:12:42,070 --> 00:12:43,136
Put it in your coffee?

304
00:12:43,138 --> 00:12:45,404
Well, I don't take it black.

305
00:12:48,710 --> 00:12:51,277
Okay. This is everything
he had on the board.

306
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:53,112
I'm sure we can
figure the rest out.

307
00:12:53,114 --> 00:12:54,847
All right.
(clears throat)

308
00:12:54,849 --> 00:12:57,016
Hmm.

309
00:12:58,953 --> 00:13:00,620
Feel free to jump in.

310
00:13:00,622 --> 00:13:03,689
"Hmm" is all I got.

311
00:13:03,691 --> 00:13:05,892
Oh, we can get this.

312
00:13:07,328 --> 00:13:09,762
Is there any chance
it's upside-down?

313
00:13:11,833 --> 00:13:12,965
Maybe we can find

314
00:13:12,967 --> 00:13:14,600
another theoretical
physicist to help us.

315
00:13:14,602 --> 00:13:17,537
It's classified. If we tell
anyone, we'd get in trouble.

316
00:13:17,539 --> 00:13:19,105
Hey, I came up with
that and "hmm."

317
00:13:19,107 --> 00:13:20,173
You haven't
pitched anything.

318
00:13:20,175 --> 00:13:22,241
Just keep thinking.

319
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:27,013
I got it.

320
00:13:29,951 --> 00:13:32,418
You really figured it out?

321
00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:36,622
No, but when we show
this nonsense to Sheldon,

322
00:13:36,624 --> 00:13:40,726
it will make him crazy,
and he'll have to fix it.

323
00:13:40,728 --> 00:13:42,395
Oh, you're a genius.

324
00:13:42,397 --> 00:13:44,096
Yeah, I know.

325
00:13:44,098 --> 00:13:45,498
That's not even a math symbol.

326
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:47,300
That's just
Charlie Brown's hair.

327
00:13:50,872 --> 00:13:52,171
Sorry, guys.

328
00:13:52,173 --> 00:13:53,439
This club was so great.

329
00:13:53,441 --> 00:13:55,441
How could they turn
it into a bookstore?

330
00:13:55,443 --> 00:13:58,277
I thought
we got rid of all those.

331
00:13:58,279 --> 00:14:01,781
Renaissance Choir's looking
pretty good right now, huh?

332
00:14:01,783 --> 00:14:03,683
(ringtone playing)

333
00:14:03,685 --> 00:14:06,018
Hello?

334
00:14:06,020 --> 00:14:08,020
(Halley crying)
Nothing to worry about.

335
00:14:08,022 --> 00:14:09,422
She's just been

336
00:14:09,424 --> 00:14:11,490
crying for a little while,
and I was wondering

337
00:14:11,492 --> 00:14:13,826
if you had any tricks
to get her to sleep.

338
00:14:13,828 --> 00:14:17,463
She was sleeping just fine
till you took a selfie with her!

339
00:14:17,465 --> 00:14:20,499
She was blowing a spit bubble.
It was adorable!

340
00:14:22,337 --> 00:14:24,570
You guys got this?
Do you need me to come home?

341
00:14:24,572 --> 00:14:26,539
(whispers):
Wait.

342
00:14:26,541 --> 00:14:28,074
She's settling down.
(Halley quiets)

343
00:14:28,076 --> 00:14:29,842
Oh, okay, false alarm.

344
00:14:29,844 --> 00:14:31,310
Little parenting tip:

345
00:14:31,312 --> 00:14:33,412
sleeping babies
hate flash photography.

346
00:14:34,816 --> 00:14:36,849
Is everything okay?

347
00:14:36,851 --> 00:14:37,950
Yeah.

348
00:14:37,952 --> 00:14:40,019
I may have just left
my infant daughter

349
00:14:40,021 --> 00:14:42,521
with Patrick and SpongeBob.

350
00:14:43,558 --> 00:14:46,058
Hey, there's another
dance club nearby.

351
00:14:46,060 --> 00:14:49,028
I mean, I don't know how
you feel about Latin music,

352
00:14:49,030 --> 00:14:53,132
but according to their <i>horas</i>
of <i>operaci?n,</i> they're open.

353
00:14:53,134 --> 00:14:55,201
Maybe we should just
call it a night.

354
00:14:55,203 --> 00:14:57,436
You sure?
They're open till <i>dos.</i>

355
00:14:57,438 --> 00:14:59,739
Yeah, we're all
dressed up.

356
00:14:59,741 --> 00:15:01,040
Why go home?

357
00:15:01,042 --> 00:15:03,276
I'm just not really
in the mood anymore.

358
00:15:03,278 --> 00:15:04,477
What's going on with you?

359
00:15:04,479 --> 00:15:06,379
I don't know.
This is all starting to feel

360
00:15:06,381 --> 00:15:08,514
like a sad attempt
to recapture our youth.

361
00:15:08,516 --> 00:15:09,949
I'm not sad.

362
00:15:09,951 --> 00:15:12,919
I just wanted to get drunk
and not wear sweatpants.

363
00:15:14,122 --> 00:15:15,154
I'm not sad.

364
00:15:15,156 --> 00:15:17,924
I mean, hello.

365
00:15:20,128 --> 00:15:21,594
Okay, maybe I'm the one
who's sad.

366
00:15:21,596 --> 00:15:23,329
What are you sad about?

367
00:15:23,331 --> 00:15:25,932
Maybe the fact that you
went and had a baby.

368
00:15:25,934 --> 00:15:27,700
You're upset I had a baby?

369
00:15:27,702 --> 00:15:29,235
No, of course not. I just...

370
00:15:29,237 --> 00:15:31,737
I didn't think it would make me
have all these feelings.

371
00:15:31,739 --> 00:15:33,406
What feelings?

372
00:15:33,408 --> 00:15:34,707
Pressure!

373
00:15:34,709 --> 00:15:36,108
I mean, she's looking
at preschools,

374
00:15:36,110 --> 00:15:37,944
she has a minivan,
she has a 401(k).

375
00:15:37,946 --> 00:15:41,580
Before she talked about it,
I just thought that was a race.

376
00:15:41,582 --> 00:15:43,649
You think that stuff is fun?

377
00:15:43,651 --> 00:15:45,484
Being a parent is terrifying.

378
00:15:45,486 --> 00:15:48,387
I'm constantly worried,
I'm always tired,

379
00:15:48,389 --> 00:15:50,656
and in a few minutes,
I'm gonna milk myself

380
00:15:50,658 --> 00:15:52,792
in a bookstore parking lot.

381
00:15:52,794 --> 00:15:54,260
I get that, okay?

382
00:15:54,262 --> 00:15:56,462
It's just, Leonard and I have
been married for two years,

383
00:15:56,464 --> 00:15:58,664
and we're no further along
than when we were dating.

384
00:15:58,666 --> 00:15:59,799
AMY:
Come on.

385
00:15:59,801 --> 00:16:01,634
You've got so much
to feel good about.

386
00:16:01,636 --> 00:16:03,069
You've got a
great job now.

387
00:16:03,071 --> 00:16:05,838
Yeah, I guess
I am making decent money.

388
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:07,640
You make more than I do.

389
00:16:07,642 --> 00:16:10,309
You may not have a house yet,
but your apartment's great.

390
00:16:10,311 --> 00:16:12,011
It's bigger than mine.

391
00:16:12,013 --> 00:16:14,513
And Leonard loves you so much,
he married you twice.

392
00:16:15,516 --> 00:16:17,516
I'm not even engaged once.

393
00:16:17,518 --> 00:16:20,086
I don't even know if Sheldon
thinks about marriage.

394
00:16:20,088 --> 00:16:21,387
I'm not getting any younger.

395
00:16:21,389 --> 00:16:23,556
Honestly,
I kind of thought by now,

396
00:16:23,558 --> 00:16:25,257
we might have had
some sort of...

397
00:16:25,259 --> 00:16:28,995
Careful. The sound of crying
can make me lactate.

398
00:16:28,997 --> 00:16:30,529
I'm sorry. I can't help it.

399
00:16:30,531 --> 00:16:31,530
(crying)

400
00:16:31,532 --> 00:16:33,666
Oh, that's gonna make me cry.

401
00:16:33,668 --> 00:16:34,834
(crying)

402
00:16:34,836 --> 00:16:37,636
And there they go.

403
00:16:39,273 --> 00:16:41,707
Ew.

404
00:16:45,546 --> 00:16:49,248
Well, Sheldon, turns out
we didn't need you after all.

405
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:52,685
That's right. We figured
it out all by ourselves.

406
00:16:52,687 --> 00:16:55,021
Wasn't even that hard.
No.

407
00:16:55,023 --> 00:16:56,822
Well, good for you guys.

408
00:16:56,824 --> 00:17:00,760
Look, I have a grease smudge on
my hand, and I'm okay with it.

409
00:17:00,762 --> 00:17:04,330
Aren't you gonna look at the
board to see how right we are?

410
00:17:04,332 --> 00:17:07,333
No, thanks. I'm busy trying
to fix this fuel pump.

411
00:17:07,335 --> 00:17:08,167
It's a manifold.

412
00:17:08,169 --> 00:17:10,236
Oh.

413
00:17:10,238 --> 00:17:12,004
Well, I guess it's fixed.

414
00:17:13,307 --> 00:17:15,341
Just look at
the board.

415
00:17:15,343 --> 00:17:16,175
That's wrong.

416
00:17:16,177 --> 00:17:18,978
Oh, no!

417
00:17:21,149 --> 00:17:24,216
What should we have
done differently?

418
00:17:24,218 --> 00:17:26,952
Well, first of all,
you can't use relativistic

419
00:17:26,954 --> 00:17:29,688
and non-relativistic vectors
in the same equation.

420
00:17:29,690 --> 00:17:31,524
Told ya. (scoffs)

421
00:17:32,727 --> 00:17:34,260
Can you fix it for us?

422
00:17:34,262 --> 00:17:35,728
(sighs)

423
00:17:35,730 --> 00:17:38,097
Okay, but this is
the last time.

424
00:17:54,515 --> 00:17:56,348
Nice try, blockheads.

425
00:17:58,119 --> 00:18:00,920
Come on, Sheldon. You can't
turn your back on physics.

426
00:18:00,922 --> 00:18:02,888
Besides, you have no idea what
you're doing with this stuff.

427
00:18:02,890 --> 00:18:05,124
But if you really want
to learn the mechanical side,

428
00:18:05,126 --> 00:18:06,892
I can teach you anything
you want to know.

429
00:18:06,894 --> 00:18:08,594
LEONARD: And instead of
standing around watching,

430
00:18:08,596 --> 00:18:11,263
you can help us build your
smaller guidance system.

431
00:18:11,265 --> 00:18:12,698
And with all these new skills,

432
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:14,533
you'd be able
to fix any model train.

433
00:18:14,535 --> 00:18:17,169
You'd be the king
of the train store!

434
00:18:17,171 --> 00:18:18,771
Excuse me. I have a girlfriend.

435
00:18:18,773 --> 00:18:21,240
I'm already king
of the train store.

436
00:18:22,977 --> 00:18:24,877
So, what do you say?

437
00:18:24,879 --> 00:18:27,480
Oh, what choice do I have?
You need me.

438
00:18:27,482 --> 00:18:30,216
I'm like the crankshaft
of this team.

439
00:18:30,218 --> 00:18:32,551
That's a turbo.

440
00:18:32,553 --> 00:18:33,786
Well, whatever it is,
it looks heavy.

441
00:18:33,788 --> 00:18:35,521
I'm gonna need you two
to get it downstairs

442
00:18:35,523 --> 00:18:36,722
before Amy comes home.

443
00:18:47,369 --> 00:18:49,602
(train chugging,
steam hissing)

444
00:18:49,604 --> 00:18:53,039
(train whistle blows)

445
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:02,282
I apologize
that it's so warm in here.

446
00:19:02,284 --> 00:19:04,851
It <i>is</i> warm in here.

447
00:19:10,993 --> 00:19:13,426
I've worked up a bit of a sweat.

448
00:19:13,428 --> 00:19:16,463
Me, too.

449
00:19:19,067 --> 00:19:21,401
May I borrow your water?

450
00:19:22,471 --> 00:19:25,638
("Rock You Like a Hurricane"
by Scorpions playing)

451
00:19:29,378 --> 00:19:32,178
? Here I am ?

452
00:19:32,180 --> 00:19:35,048
? Rock you like a hurricane ?

453
00:19:36,651 --> 00:19:39,886
? Here I am ?

454
00:19:39,888 --> 00:19:44,391
? Rock you like hurricane... ?

455
00:19:44,393 --> 00:19:46,292
SHELDON:
<i>The light's green.</i>

456
00:19:49,831 --> 00:19:51,865
Sorry.

457
00:19:51,867 --> 00:19:54,597
GPS says we'll be at the railway
in three hours.

458
00:19:54,598 --> 00:19:56,278
I can get us there in two.
