1
00:00:02,974 --> 00:00:05,041
If we're going to be staying
in this apartment,

2
00:00:05,043 --> 00:00:06,476
would you be interested
in doing a little

3
00:00:06,478 --> 00:00:07,877
redecorating?

4
00:00:08,713 --> 00:00:11,848
Oh, actually, I would.

5
00:00:11,850 --> 00:00:13,716
Great, what'd you have in mind?

6
00:00:13,718 --> 00:00:16,853
Let's take every single thing
from the other apartment

7
00:00:16,855 --> 00:00:18,955
and put it in here.

8
00:00:18,957 --> 00:00:21,457
Well, how about we start
a little smaller?

9
00:00:21,459 --> 00:00:23,893
Like moving
the furniture around.

10
00:00:23,895 --> 00:00:26,129
You know, I have always thought

11
00:00:26,131 --> 00:00:28,064
that this couch
would look fantastic

12
00:00:28,066 --> 00:00:30,700
on the curb
in front of the building.

13
00:00:30,702 --> 00:00:34,203
Look, we can't just
throw away Penny's stuff,

14
00:00:34,205 --> 00:00:37,773
but we can ask
if she wants any of it back.

15
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:40,643
You know, I wonder how
she feels about

16
00:00:40,645 --> 00:00:42,912
all this artwork.

17
00:00:42,914 --> 00:00:45,548
Well, I'm sure
she misses this one.

18
00:00:45,550 --> 00:00:48,918
I mean, it's the greatest gift
I've ever given anybody.

19
00:00:54,526 --> 00:00:59,328
It truly does capture the beauty
of your friendship with Penny.

20
00:01:01,266 --> 00:01:02,999
It may have appreciated
in value.

21
00:01:03,001 --> 00:01:06,169
The artist killed himself
shortly after painting that.

22
00:01:07,205 --> 00:01:10,873
Yeah, it seems only right
that she have it back.

23
00:01:10,875 --> 00:01:12,475
I can't wait to see
the look on her face

24
00:01:12,477 --> 00:01:15,077
when I give it to her again.

25
00:01:20,351 --> 00:01:23,920
Look, it's the same smile
she has in the painting.

26
00:01:24,989 --> 00:01:28,391
? Our whole universe
was in a hot, dense state ?

27
00:01:28,393 --> 00:01:31,727
? Then nearly 14 billion years
ago expansion started... Wait! ?

28
00:01:31,729 --> 00:01:33,296
? The Earth began to cool ?

29
00:01:33,298 --> 00:01:35,865
? The autotrophs began to drool,
Neanderthals developed tools ?

30
00:01:35,867 --> 00:01:38,501
? We built the Wall ?
? <i>We built the pyramids</i> ?

31
00:01:38,503 --> 00:01:41,170
? Math, Science, History,
unraveling the mystery ?

32
00:01:41,172 --> 00:01:43,072
? That all started
with a big bang ?

33
00:01:43,074 --> 00:01:43,574
? <i>Bang!</i> ?

34
00:01:43,575 --> 00:01:47,575

36
00:01:53,887 --> 00:01:56,888
Yeah-- there's hooks in the
closet, I can hang it right now.

37
00:01:56,890 --> 00:01:58,723
Oh, no, no,
Th-those hooks are gone.

38
00:01:58,725 --> 00:01:59,958
What happened to them?

39
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:01,993
Uh, we ran out of candy
on Halloween,

40
00:02:01,995 --> 00:02:04,696
I was just giving
everything away.

41
00:02:05,532 --> 00:02:07,199
Hey, guys, what are you...?

42
00:02:07,201 --> 00:02:09,434
Oh, that's here, cool.

43
00:02:09,436 --> 00:02:12,204
Amy wants me to have it.

44
00:02:12,206 --> 00:02:13,872
Well, it would be selfish
of me to keep it.

45
00:02:13,874 --> 00:02:15,707
B-But it's a picture of you.

46
00:02:15,709 --> 00:02:17,509
And you.

47
00:02:17,511 --> 00:02:19,611
But you commissioned it.

48
00:02:19,613 --> 00:02:21,780
To give to you.

49
00:02:21,782 --> 00:02:24,049
But you like it so much.

50
00:02:24,051 --> 00:02:26,017
So do you.

51
00:02:27,054 --> 00:02:28,720
I seem to be losing.

52
00:02:28,722 --> 00:02:31,356
Yes, you do.

53
00:02:31,358 --> 00:02:33,125
You know, Leonard,
the more I think about it,

54
00:02:33,127 --> 00:02:35,794
there are a number of mutually
owned items in this apartment

55
00:02:35,796 --> 00:02:37,262
that you and I
should go through.

56
00:02:37,264 --> 00:02:38,563
Uh, for example...

57
00:02:39,566 --> 00:02:41,900
who gets our beloved sword,
Longclaw?

58
00:02:41,902 --> 00:02:42,901
Why don't you keep it?

59
00:02:42,903 --> 00:02:44,169
That seems fair;
we did just give you

60
00:02:44,171 --> 00:02:46,037
the painting.

61
00:02:46,039 --> 00:02:47,405
Yeah, I don't need
anything around

62
00:02:47,407 --> 00:02:49,574
that I can stab myself with.

63
00:02:49,576 --> 00:02:51,009
Wonderful,

64
00:02:51,011 --> 00:02:52,244
Longclaw is mine.

65
00:02:52,246 --> 00:02:54,212
And how about you keep

66
00:02:54,214 --> 00:02:56,414
our... avocado plant?

67
00:03:00,387 --> 00:03:02,988
Sounds right--
a limited edition collectible

68
00:03:02,990 --> 00:03:04,356
worth hundreds of dollars

69
00:03:04,358 --> 00:03:05,590
and a thing

70
00:03:05,592 --> 00:03:08,627
that grew out of a thing
we fished from the trash.

71
00:03:08,629 --> 00:03:11,530
Although, Amy and I did
just move in together,

72
00:03:11,532 --> 00:03:14,166
and a plant is
a lovely housewarming gift.

73
00:03:14,168 --> 00:03:16,268
Fine, take the plant.

74
00:03:16,270 --> 00:03:17,769
Oh, we got a sword
and a plant;

75
00:03:17,771 --> 00:03:19,337
our apartment's
really shaping up.

76
00:03:22,843 --> 00:03:24,643
Stuart, you didn't have
to get us a baby gift.

77
00:03:24,645 --> 00:03:25,911
Oh.

78
00:03:25,913 --> 00:03:28,446
Just homemade coupons for things
you might need help with

79
00:03:28,448 --> 00:03:29,848
before the baby gets here.

80
00:03:29,850 --> 00:03:32,951
Going to the grocery store,
driving you to the doctor.

81
00:03:32,953 --> 00:03:36,254
If you're not in a hurry,
I can dig you a koi pond.

82
00:03:38,225 --> 00:03:40,125
A foot massage?

83
00:03:40,127 --> 00:03:43,461
And that's not me being creepy,
that's for either of you.

84
00:03:45,632 --> 00:03:48,767
This is very nice,
Stuart, thank you.

85
00:03:48,769 --> 00:03:51,903
How come this one's on
the back of an eviction notice?

86
00:03:51,905 --> 00:03:55,507
Oh, yeah.
Uh, now that you mention it...

87
00:03:55,509 --> 00:03:57,842
can I live here?

88
00:03:59,213 --> 00:04:01,680
Stuart, we'd love
to help you out,

89
00:04:01,682 --> 00:04:04,716
but this a bad time;
we're about to have a baby.

90
00:04:04,718 --> 00:04:06,451
Or is that why
this is a great time?

91
00:04:06,453 --> 00:04:08,453
Think about it--
when that baby comes,

92
00:04:08,455 --> 00:04:10,689
you're gonna need all the help
you can get.

93
00:04:10,691 --> 00:04:12,123
Thank you,

94
00:04:12,125 --> 00:04:14,092
but I'm not really sure.

95
00:04:15,028 --> 00:04:16,561
Hang on, maybe it's
not the worst idea.

96
00:04:16,563 --> 00:04:19,497
I mean, he did do a good job
taking care of my mother.

97
00:04:19,499 --> 00:04:23,768
That woman didn't get heat rash
once with me on powder patrol.

98
00:04:25,505 --> 00:04:26,838
Hey...

99
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:28,406
I guess you could stay
for a few days

100
00:04:28,408 --> 00:04:29,708
and we'll see how it goes.

101
00:04:29,710 --> 00:04:31,109
Thank you.

102
00:04:31,111 --> 00:04:32,911
And it's only temporary,

103
00:04:32,913 --> 00:04:35,080
just till I get back on my feet.

104
00:04:35,082 --> 00:04:37,882
or the baby goes off to college,
whichever happens first.

105
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:41,453
When would you move in?

106
00:04:41,455 --> 00:04:44,222
Well, uh, my car broke down
in your driveway,

107
00:04:44,224 --> 00:04:46,625
so I'm gonna say now.

108
00:04:47,728 --> 00:04:49,628
But I am ready to be helpful.

109
00:04:49,630 --> 00:04:51,496
In fact...

110
00:04:51,498 --> 00:04:52,464
I'm gonna go vacuum.

111
00:04:52,466 --> 00:04:56,101
Hmm. Actually I just
did that this morning.

112
00:04:56,103 --> 00:04:57,502
Okay.

113
00:04:57,504 --> 00:04:58,770
Then I'll dust.

114
00:04:58,772 --> 00:05:00,972
I did that, too.

115
00:05:00,974 --> 00:05:04,276
Then I'll check the batteries
in the smoke detectors.

116
00:05:04,278 --> 00:05:06,111
Howard just did that.

117
00:05:06,113 --> 00:05:09,180
Yeah, let him do it.

118
00:05:12,786 --> 00:05:14,386
Oh.

119
00:05:14,388 --> 00:05:15,754
Remember when we got this

120
00:05:15,756 --> 00:05:17,188
at Comic-Con?

121
00:05:17,190 --> 00:05:18,490
Oh, yeah.

122
00:05:18,492 --> 00:05:21,493
The Mr. Spock cuckoo clock.

123
00:05:21,495 --> 00:05:25,063
Live long and prosper.
Live long and prosper.

124
00:05:25,065 --> 00:05:26,831
Live long
and prosper.

125
00:05:26,833 --> 00:05:28,833
Live long and prosper.

126
00:05:28,835 --> 00:05:31,169
It's one of a kind.

127
00:05:31,171 --> 00:05:34,272
So if it breaks
there'd be none of it?

128
00:05:35,475 --> 00:05:36,608
Well, Leonard,

129
00:05:36,610 --> 00:05:38,443
you know, who should keep this?

130
00:05:38,445 --> 00:05:42,347
On the one hand, I love
Mr. Spock more than you do.

131
00:05:42,349 --> 00:05:45,617
On the other hand, I care more
about clocks than you do.

132
00:05:45,619 --> 00:05:47,152
So you think you should keep it?

133
00:05:47,154 --> 00:05:48,420
I'll be right across the hall.

134
00:05:48,422 --> 00:05:50,588
You'll probably be able
to hear it.

135
00:05:52,793 --> 00:05:54,059
Keep the clock, Sheldon.

136
00:05:54,061 --> 00:05:55,193
Thank you.

137
00:05:55,195 --> 00:05:57,796
Thank you.
Thank you?

138
00:05:58,665 --> 00:06:00,398
Oh, now...

139
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,334
what about

140
00:06:02,336 --> 00:06:03,802
our 3-D chess set?

141
00:06:03,804 --> 00:06:04,869
Let me guess, you want it.

142
00:06:04,871 --> 00:06:06,171
Well, no,

143
00:06:06,173 --> 00:06:07,839
I just didn't think you'd want
a physical reminder

144
00:06:07,841 --> 00:06:10,575
of a game you never
managed to win.

145
00:06:10,577 --> 00:06:13,011
As a kindness, I should probably
take all the games.

146
00:06:13,013 --> 00:06:15,413
You know what, Sheldon, take it.

147
00:06:15,415 --> 00:06:16,981
In fact, you can
have everything.

148
00:06:16,983 --> 00:06:18,416
I really don't care.

149
00:06:18,652 --> 00:06:20,419
Are you sure?

150
00:06:20,421 --> 00:06:23,255
These items represent
our shared times together.

151
00:06:23,257 --> 00:06:24,756
Well, now they're yours.
Leonard....

152
00:06:24,758 --> 00:06:26,091
Well, you know
what's gonna happen.

153
00:06:26,093 --> 00:06:27,359
He's just gonna come up
with some reason

154
00:06:27,361 --> 00:06:28,827
why everything should be his.

155
00:06:28,829 --> 00:06:30,696
For a man so good
at predicting my moves,

156
00:06:30,698 --> 00:06:32,731
how come you stink at 3-D chess?

157
00:06:33,834 --> 00:06:36,468
Sheldon, you're-you're being
a little selfish.

158
00:06:36,470 --> 00:06:38,737
Why don't you let Leonard
keep a few things?

159
00:06:38,739 --> 00:06:40,038
It's not my fault
I'm bad at sharing;

160
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,840
I skipped kindergarten.

161
00:06:41,842 --> 00:06:43,442
You know what?

162
00:06:43,444 --> 00:06:46,011
There is one thing I would like.

163
00:06:46,013 --> 00:06:48,380
Yeah, take whatever you want.

164
00:06:48,382 --> 00:06:50,549
I would like to keep...

165
00:06:50,551 --> 00:06:53,318
the official flag
of our apartment.

166
00:06:54,188 --> 00:06:56,521
But you don't even like flags.

167
00:06:56,523 --> 00:06:58,323
Yeah, I like this one.

168
00:07:00,361 --> 00:07:02,661
But I designed it.

169
00:07:02,663 --> 00:07:05,764
But you made me order it because
you were "too well-known"

170
00:07:05,766 --> 00:07:09,868
in the flag community
and they'd jack up the price.

171
00:07:09,870 --> 00:07:11,203
But you don't even understand

172
00:07:11,205 --> 00:07:13,538
its symbolism.
Oh, I do.

173
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:16,908
The-the field of blue
represents you being miserable,

174
00:07:16,910 --> 00:07:19,578
and the lion sticking
its tongue out means

175
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:21,446
I'm happy about it.

176
00:07:24,551 --> 00:07:26,985
Come along, Amy.

177
00:07:26,987 --> 00:07:29,254
I know when I'm not wanted.

178
00:07:30,157 --> 00:07:34,259
I don't think you do,
but all right.

179
00:07:36,563 --> 00:07:39,197
Stuart, you cooked?

180
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:40,832
How did you know it wasn't me?

181
00:07:40,834 --> 00:07:42,534
There's only three
people in this house,

182
00:07:42,536 --> 00:07:44,670
and you'd still be
my fifth guess.

183
00:07:46,674 --> 00:07:49,074
That's Raj.

184
00:07:49,076 --> 00:07:50,242
You guys relax,

185
00:07:50,244 --> 00:07:51,343
I'll get it.

186
00:07:51,345 --> 00:07:54,046
Have some bread
while it's still warm.

187
00:07:55,449 --> 00:07:56,815
It's like we have a butler.

188
00:07:56,817 --> 00:07:59,851
If I had a Batsuit
I'd be Bruce Wayne.

189
00:08:00,688 --> 00:08:03,855
You have a Batsuit.

190
00:08:03,857 --> 00:08:06,324
It's pajamas, there's no cape.

191
00:08:07,628 --> 00:08:09,261
Hey, Raj.

192
00:08:09,263 --> 00:08:10,495
Hey, Stuart.

193
00:08:10,497 --> 00:08:12,998
What are you doing here?
Oh, I'm living here again.

194
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,334
Do, uh, Howard
and Bernadette know?

195
00:08:16,336 --> 00:08:19,705
Or is it like a possum
in the walls kind of thing?

196
00:08:19,707 --> 00:08:23,508
No, I needed a place to stay

197
00:08:23,510 --> 00:08:24,676
and, with the baby coming,

198
00:08:24,678 --> 00:08:26,378
I figured they could
use some extra help.

199
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:28,914
Okay, cool.

200
00:08:28,916 --> 00:08:30,248
Anyway, come on in,
dinner's ready.

201
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:31,983
Oh, but I bought
Chinese takeout.

202
00:08:31,985 --> 00:08:34,186
Oh, okay.

203
00:08:34,188 --> 00:08:37,122
Well, if Bernadette wants her
ankles to swell up even more,

204
00:08:37,124 --> 00:08:38,323
she can have that.

205
00:08:42,463 --> 00:08:45,330
Is the Wi-Fi working for you?

206
00:08:45,332 --> 00:08:47,699
Uh, hang on.

207
00:08:47,701 --> 00:08:49,568
I don't think so,
I'm clicking on

208
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:50,869
"One weird trick
for a flat belly,"

209
00:08:50,871 --> 00:08:51,870
but I'm still seeing

210
00:08:51,872 --> 00:08:55,173
"Celebrities who look like
their pets."

211
00:08:55,175 --> 00:08:57,275
Oh, I knew it,

212
00:08:57,277 --> 00:08:58,910
Sheldon changed the password.

213
00:08:58,912 --> 00:08:59,911
Are you sure?

214
00:08:59,913 --> 00:09:01,413
Well, the new network name is,

215
00:09:01,415 --> 00:09:05,283
"Ha ha ha, now I've got you,"
so...

216
00:09:06,754 --> 00:09:09,955
It's either Sheldon
or Gargamel from <i>The Smurfs.</i>

217
00:09:09,957 --> 00:09:11,990
What a jerk.

218
00:09:11,992 --> 00:09:14,493
You're good at revenge;
how do we get him back?

219
00:09:14,495 --> 00:09:16,194
Well, my go-to move is usually

220
00:09:16,196 --> 00:09:17,696
sleep with the
person's boyfriend,

221
00:09:17,698 --> 00:09:21,299
but I kind of feel like
I'm already doing that.

222
00:09:27,941 --> 00:09:29,441
Sheldon, I know what you did,

223
00:09:29,443 --> 00:09:32,010
now change the password back.

224
00:09:32,012 --> 00:09:35,881
Well, powder me in sugar
and call me a donut,

225
00:09:35,883 --> 00:09:39,384
if it isn't Leonard Hofstadter.

226
00:09:39,386 --> 00:09:42,320
Sheldon, I'm warning you,
I can play this game, too.

227
00:09:42,322 --> 00:09:44,189
If it's like
your 3-D chess game,

228
00:09:44,191 --> 00:09:46,825
then you're out of your length,
width and depth.

229
00:09:47,728 --> 00:09:50,128
Amy, get the Neosporin,

230
00:09:50,130 --> 00:09:52,631
somebody just got burned.

231
00:09:53,433 --> 00:09:55,901
All right, I tried.

232
00:09:55,903 --> 00:09:58,136
"All right,
I tried."

233
00:09:58,138 --> 00:10:00,839
That should be the title
of your autobiography.

234
00:10:02,075 --> 00:10:05,177
Ooh, a second-degree burn.

235
00:10:06,113 --> 00:10:07,279
I've got the Neosporin.

236
00:10:07,281 --> 00:10:09,080
Who got hurt?

237
00:10:09,082 --> 00:10:10,448
It's a good thing you're cute.

238
00:10:18,892 --> 00:10:22,227
So, I was reading how it's
a good idea for new parents

239
00:10:22,229 --> 00:10:24,396
to take an
infant CPR class.

240
00:10:24,398 --> 00:10:26,865
Yeah, we've been
meaning to do that.

241
00:10:26,867 --> 00:10:29,634
Oh, I know a CPR instructor
who'll come to the house.

242
00:10:29,636 --> 00:10:31,570
- That'd be great.
- I'll give him a call.

243
00:10:31,572 --> 00:10:33,271
We met when I was sleeping
on the beach

244
00:10:33,273 --> 00:10:34,806
and he thought I was dead.

245
00:10:37,611 --> 00:10:39,044
Thank you again
for cooking.

246
00:10:39,046 --> 00:10:41,413
It's getting tough for me
to be on my feet all day.

247
00:10:41,415 --> 00:10:44,282
You just kick back and relax;
I've got it all under control.

248
00:10:45,152 --> 00:10:47,385
Although it was
already under control.

249
00:10:48,922 --> 00:10:51,156
I'm sorry,
you mumbled something?

250
00:10:52,025 --> 00:10:53,792
It's just that

251
00:10:53,794 --> 00:10:55,827
they've had plenty of help.

252
00:10:55,829 --> 00:10:58,096
Well, you know what they say--
it takes a village.

253
00:10:58,098 --> 00:11:00,565
Well, they already
had a village.

254
00:11:01,802 --> 00:11:03,602
I noticed the village
couldn't find time

255
00:11:03,604 --> 00:11:05,136
to put the crib together.

256
00:11:05,138 --> 00:11:06,371
Yeah, well, maybe

257
00:11:06,373 --> 00:11:08,139
the village was too busy
checking out

258
00:11:08,141 --> 00:11:09,908
the local Montessori school
for the new arrival.

259
00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:10,942
You mean the one

260
00:11:10,944 --> 00:11:12,878
with the empty beer bottles
in the sandbox?

261
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,579
We'll pass, thank you.

262
00:11:16,149 --> 00:11:19,050
Do something, Batman.

263
00:11:23,857 --> 00:11:26,057
Hey.

264
00:11:27,728 --> 00:11:29,561
What do you think you're doing?

265
00:11:29,563 --> 00:11:32,597
Separating my delicates.

266
00:11:33,901 --> 00:11:35,567
This is the level
you're stooping to.

267
00:11:35,569 --> 00:11:36,534
No.

268
00:11:36,536 --> 00:11:41,606
This is the level
I am stooping to.

269
00:11:45,045 --> 00:11:49,881
I believe that is flag
to crotch four, checkmate.

270
00:11:50,684 --> 00:11:53,818
Easy-peasy, ooh, so breezy.

271
00:11:55,000 --> 00:12:01,074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

272
00:12:06,971 --> 00:12:07,971
Hey, what's up?

273
00:12:08,039 --> 00:12:09,439
I'm here to put
the crib together.

274
00:12:09,441 --> 00:12:11,274
Ooh, sorry, I already did it.

275
00:12:11,276 --> 00:12:15,111
Oh, I don't know if you realize
this, but I bought that crib.

276
00:12:15,113 --> 00:12:19,515
Oh, yeah, I read about that
on WhoGivesACrap.com

277
00:12:21,319 --> 00:12:22,719
Why are you being like this?

278
00:12:23,788 --> 00:12:25,655
Because I love
Howard and Bernadette

279
00:12:25,657 --> 00:12:29,058
and if I want to keep mooching
off them, I need to be helpful.

280
00:12:29,928 --> 00:12:30,993
Hey, this pregnancy had

281
00:12:30,995 --> 00:12:32,028
an emotionally-needy third wheel

282
00:12:32,030 --> 00:12:34,163
way before you came along.

283
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:37,500
Why can't there be four wheels?

284
00:12:37,502 --> 00:12:40,069
Is this what you do
when I'm not here,

285
00:12:40,071 --> 00:12:42,305
make really good points?

286
00:12:42,307 --> 00:12:46,109
Look-Look, just come in and
help me build a baby swing.

287
00:12:46,111 --> 00:12:47,910
Thank you.

288
00:12:47,912 --> 00:12:51,114
If you're hungry you can eat
your takeout; nobody touched it.

289
00:12:53,284 --> 00:12:54,751
I think I'm gonna
go for a run.

290
00:12:54,753 --> 00:12:56,085
You want to come?

291
00:12:56,087 --> 00:12:58,988
No, last time that old lady
in the park kept screaming,

292
00:12:58,990 --> 00:13:01,591
"Watch out, he's
right behind you."

293
00:13:05,296 --> 00:13:06,829
Hello?

294
00:13:06,831 --> 00:13:10,166
Hey, how you doing?

295
00:13:11,002 --> 00:13:13,269
Uh, can I help you?

296
00:13:13,271 --> 00:13:16,939
I don't think so,
but you're sweet for asking.

297
00:13:17,776 --> 00:13:18,841
What-What are you doing

298
00:13:18,843 --> 00:13:20,343
in our apartment?

299
00:13:20,345 --> 00:13:24,714
Oh, I rented a room from
your neighbor, the tall guy...

300
00:13:24,716 --> 00:13:27,417
dressed like a little boy.

301
00:13:28,253 --> 00:13:29,786
Unbelievable.

302
00:13:29,788 --> 00:13:32,388
Okay, uh, I don't know
what he told you,

303
00:13:32,390 --> 00:13:34,090
but you can't stay here.

304
00:13:34,092 --> 00:13:36,526
So, there are fresh linens
on the bed and...

305
00:13:36,528 --> 00:13:37,493
Oh.

306
00:13:37,495 --> 00:13:39,395
Well, now, I see
you've met Theodore.

307
00:13:41,032 --> 00:13:43,866
Theodore, these
are your new roommates,

308
00:13:43,868 --> 00:13:45,201
Leonard and Penny.

309
00:13:45,203 --> 00:13:46,536
They're very honest,

310
00:13:46,538 --> 00:13:48,104
but I would not leave
cash lying around.

311
00:13:48,106 --> 00:13:50,173
Sheldon,

312
00:13:50,175 --> 00:13:51,574
what do you think
you're doing?

313
00:13:51,576 --> 00:13:53,910
My room is paid up
until the end of the month,

314
00:13:53,912 --> 00:13:55,311
so I can do
with it whatever

315
00:13:55,313 --> 00:13:56,579
I please, which includes

316
00:13:56,581 --> 00:13:59,148
renting it out
for a dollar a night.

317
00:13:59,150 --> 00:14:00,983
It's like the '40s again.

318
00:14:04,155 --> 00:14:06,856
Anyway, I'll leave you be.

319
00:14:06,858 --> 00:14:08,057
I have to... oh, oh!

320
00:14:08,059 --> 00:14:10,159
He's expecting a newspaper
in the morning.

321
00:14:10,161 --> 00:14:12,361
Apparently,
they still make them.

322
00:14:12,363 --> 00:14:15,097
All right, Sheldon,
this is over the line.

323
00:14:15,099 --> 00:14:16,065
That's true,

324
00:14:16,067 --> 00:14:18,167
but had I done
something under the line,

325
00:14:18,169 --> 00:14:19,669
there wouldn't be a man
in your kitchen

326
00:14:19,671 --> 00:14:21,938
who can't produce
a single form of ID.

327
00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:23,806
Oh, oh, I have a receipt
from a blood bank.

328
00:14:24,409 --> 00:14:26,876
I'm O-negative.

329
00:14:30,081 --> 00:14:32,815
And now you know as much
about him as I do.

330
00:14:36,187 --> 00:14:38,221
Oh, hey, Bernadette,

331
00:14:38,223 --> 00:14:40,256
the swing comes
with two different mobiles.

332
00:14:40,258 --> 00:14:44,126
The giraffes are pretty cute,
what do you think?

333
00:14:44,128 --> 00:14:45,862
Great, go with the giraffes.

334
00:14:45,864 --> 00:14:47,096
Although...

335
00:14:47,098 --> 00:14:49,432
the high contrast
of zebra stripes might provide

336
00:14:49,434 --> 00:14:51,534
better stimulus
for a developing baby.

337
00:14:52,604 --> 00:14:55,972
Yeah, you're probably right,
go with the zebras.

338
00:14:55,974 --> 00:14:57,773
Good choice, boss.

339
00:15:00,144 --> 00:15:02,812
At least my nose
is naturally brown.

340
00:15:06,584 --> 00:15:09,051
Hey, could you please go
to the market for me?

341
00:15:09,053 --> 00:15:10,920
Get Stuart or Raj to do it.

342
00:15:10,922 --> 00:15:13,656
Howie, they've been doing
everything for you.

343
00:15:13,658 --> 00:15:14,957
Mm, I know.

344
00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:17,493
It's really making me
lose respect for both of them.

345
00:15:18,296 --> 00:15:20,229
Please just go to the store.

346
00:15:20,231 --> 00:15:22,932
Fine.

347
00:15:22,934 --> 00:15:25,368
Who wants to drive me
to the store?

348
00:15:25,370 --> 00:15:26,903
- Me!
- I'll do it!

349
00:15:26,905 --> 00:15:27,970
Take Raj.

350
00:15:27,972 --> 00:15:31,407
Stuart is supposed
to paint my toenails.

351
00:15:42,186 --> 00:15:43,185
What do you think?

352
00:15:43,187 --> 00:15:44,520
Should we go to a hotel?

353
00:15:44,522 --> 00:15:46,522
And just leave
him here alone?

354
00:15:46,524 --> 00:15:47,990
Okay, I'll go to a hotel.

355
00:15:47,992 --> 00:15:50,459
Text me in the morning
if you're still alive.

356
00:15:53,097 --> 00:15:54,130
Uh, Theodore,

357
00:15:54,132 --> 00:15:55,364
how long

358
00:15:55,366 --> 00:15:57,833
are you planning
to stay exactly?

359
00:15:57,835 --> 00:16:00,336
Oh, thanks to the coins
I found in your couch,

360
00:16:00,338 --> 00:16:02,905
a day longer than I thought.

361
00:16:03,708 --> 00:16:05,541
This is ridiculous.

362
00:16:08,246 --> 00:16:10,346
I like the painting.

363
00:16:10,348 --> 00:16:12,448
Is that your mom?

364
00:16:17,055 --> 00:16:19,822
Sheldon, get out here!

365
00:16:20,625 --> 00:16:22,224
Will you keep it down?

366
00:16:22,226 --> 00:16:23,893
What kind of vengeful
bed and breakfast

367
00:16:23,895 --> 00:16:26,062
do you think I'm running?

368
00:16:26,064 --> 00:16:28,631
We lived together
13 years.

369
00:16:28,633 --> 00:16:29,932
How can you be so awful to me?

370
00:16:29,934 --> 00:16:31,367
I'm being awful?!

371
00:16:31,369 --> 00:16:33,436
You're the one who went
out of your way to hurt me.

372
00:16:33,438 --> 00:16:34,670
Because you were
being selfish.

373
00:16:34,672 --> 00:16:36,973
Dividing our belongings
is difficult.

374
00:16:36,975 --> 00:16:38,774
Why?
I said I didn't care!

375
00:16:38,776 --> 00:16:40,242
Excuse me.

376
00:16:40,244 --> 00:16:43,412
It's none of my business,
but it sounds like a lot

377
00:16:43,414 --> 00:16:47,583
of this anger
is coming from love.

378
00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:51,954
Yeah, thanks,
but nobody asked you.

379
00:16:51,956 --> 00:16:55,124
Well, I'm just gonna
keep on talking.

380
00:16:55,994 --> 00:16:57,259
Seems like, with Sheldon

381
00:16:57,261 --> 00:17:02,164
moving out, you're
in a new phase of your lives

382
00:17:02,166 --> 00:17:03,666
and it's easier

383
00:17:03,668 --> 00:17:06,669
to fight than
to face the feelings

384
00:17:06,671 --> 00:17:09,572
that you have for one another.

385
00:17:10,975 --> 00:17:13,376
I think he might be right.

386
00:17:13,378 --> 00:17:15,344
Also, who is that?

387
00:17:16,547 --> 00:17:19,415
I have to admit,

388
00:17:19,417 --> 00:17:21,050
leaving you to
move in with Amy

389
00:17:21,052 --> 00:17:23,486
has been harder than
I thought it would be.

390
00:17:23,488 --> 00:17:25,121
Well, for me, too.

391
00:17:25,123 --> 00:17:27,056
It's not the same
with you gone.

392
00:17:27,058 --> 00:17:28,758
If you're looking for a new guy
to live with...

393
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:30,526
-No!
- We're good. Thank you.

394
00:17:31,829 --> 00:17:34,497
So, no one's gonna
tell me? Okay.

395
00:17:34,499 --> 00:17:35,831
Leonard,

396
00:17:35,833 --> 00:17:37,233
I would like us
to stop fighting

397
00:17:37,235 --> 00:17:38,601
about our possessions.

398
00:17:38,603 --> 00:17:40,236
Well, I'd like that, too.

399
00:17:40,238 --> 00:17:43,572
In fact, I want you to
keep the apartment flag,

400
00:17:43,574 --> 00:17:44,874
and I'm not
just saying that

401
00:17:44,876 --> 00:17:47,410
because it touched
your genitals.

402
00:17:47,412 --> 00:17:48,811
You promise?

403
00:17:48,813 --> 00:17:50,012
I do.

404
00:17:50,014 --> 00:17:51,647
And to show you that there
are no hard feelings,

405
00:17:51,649 --> 00:17:55,518
I am willing to rub my
genitals on it as well.

406
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:56,919
Well...

407
00:17:56,921 --> 00:18:01,257
if we're rubbing genitals
on things, that's where I shine.

408
00:18:11,477 --> 00:18:14,111
Little lower to the left.

409
00:18:14,113 --> 00:18:16,981
A little more.

410
00:18:16,983 --> 00:18:18,416
Is it good?

411
00:18:18,418 --> 00:18:21,118
No, still hideous.

412
00:18:24,524 --> 00:18:27,057
Well, I'm sure
at some point,

413
00:18:27,059 --> 00:18:28,659
we won't even
notice it's there.

414
00:18:28,661 --> 00:18:29,627
Yeah, you'd think that,

415
00:18:29,629 --> 00:18:31,228
but after a while it starts

416
00:18:31,230 --> 00:18:33,731
showing up in your dreams.

417
00:18:34,567 --> 00:18:36,767
I think it brings
the room together.

418
00:18:39,439 --> 00:18:41,472
Hey, tomorrow who wants
to paint the nursery?

419
00:18:41,474 --> 00:18:42,339
I'll do it.

420
00:18:42,341 --> 00:18:43,474
Why do you get to do it?

421
00:18:43,476 --> 00:18:44,508
I'm the artist.

422
00:18:44,510 --> 00:18:45,609
Just because you're starving

423
00:18:45,611 --> 00:18:47,545
doesn't make you an artist.

424
00:18:47,547 --> 00:18:50,815
Just because I look sickly
doesn't mean I'm starving.

425
00:18:50,817 --> 00:18:52,783
Howard!

426
00:18:53,886 --> 00:18:56,654
Guys, you heard her,
go see what she wants.

427
00:18:58,524 --> 00:19:00,324
I think I'm in labor.

428
00:19:00,326 --> 00:19:01,659
Oh, oh, okay.

429
00:19:01,661 --> 00:19:04,361
Okay, uh, uh, uh,
I can do this.

430
00:19:04,363 --> 00:19:05,496
We have a plan.

431
00:19:05,498 --> 00:19:07,565
Somebody please
tell me the plan.

432
00:19:07,567 --> 00:19:09,800
I'll get the hospital bag.
I'll pull the van up.

433
00:19:09,802 --> 00:19:10,868
Meet you outside in 2 minutes.

434
00:19:10,870 --> 00:19:13,337
Team Baby, go!

435
00:19:15,508 --> 00:19:16,674
I love you.

436
00:19:16,676 --> 00:19:18,642
I love you, too.

437
00:19:19,564 --> 00:19:22,565
Are we hugging or having a baby?
Let's go!
