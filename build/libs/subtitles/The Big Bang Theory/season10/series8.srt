1
00:00:03,414 --> 00:00:05,614
How much will it hurt?

2
00:00:06,417 --> 00:00:07,683
It's just
a tiny skin sample.

3
00:00:07,685 --> 00:00:09,484
You saw me
do it to myself.

4
00:00:09,486 --> 00:00:12,421
On a scale of one to ten,
where one is a pebble

5
00:00:12,423 --> 00:00:15,324
in your shoe
and ten is the monkey

6
00:00:15,326 --> 00:00:18,126
you thought was your pet
biting your face off.

7
00:00:18,128 --> 00:00:19,828
A two.

8
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:22,331
Eating a whole Altoid?

9
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:24,266
Sheldon,

10
00:00:24,268 --> 00:00:25,968
if I'm gonna synthesize
a neural network

11
00:00:25,970 --> 00:00:27,903
from our skin cells,
I need to harvest them.

12
00:00:27,905 --> 00:00:30,472
Now, I've done this dozens
of times, but if you're

13
00:00:30,474 --> 00:00:32,007
too scared
you don't have to.

14
00:00:32,009 --> 00:00:33,875
No, this is for science.

15
00:00:33,877 --> 00:00:36,011
I can be brave
for science.

16
00:00:37,348 --> 00:00:39,314
Thank you.

17
00:00:39,316 --> 00:00:41,583
Oh, jiminy, that's cold!

18
00:00:41,585 --> 00:00:43,452
Just think how happy
you'll be in a few weeks

19
00:00:43,454 --> 00:00:44,820
when I've converted
our skin cells

20
00:00:44,822 --> 00:00:46,355
into functional
brain cells.

21
00:00:46,357 --> 00:00:50,058
All right, just warn me
before you do it.

22
00:00:50,060 --> 00:00:52,494
Okay.

23
00:00:52,496 --> 00:00:54,129
Three...

24
00:00:54,131 --> 00:00:55,797
two...
and we're done.

25
00:00:58,469 --> 00:01:00,302
You tricked me.

26
00:01:00,304 --> 00:01:01,903
You didn't say one.

27
00:01:01,905 --> 00:01:03,839
It didn't hurt, did it?
No...

28
00:01:03,841 --> 00:01:06,074
but “three, two and we're done”
is incomplete.

29
00:01:06,076 --> 00:01:08,010
You know those
things bother me.

30
00:01:08,012 --> 00:01:09,611
It's like hearing
“da-da-da-da-da-dah”

31
00:01:09,613 --> 00:01:10,646
without yelling...

32
00:01:10,648 --> 00:01:12,314
Okay, fine, one.

33
00:01:12,316 --> 00:01:13,982
Thank you.

34
00:01:13,984 --> 00:01:16,918
Now yell “Charge” and
we can get out of here.

35
00:01:17,207 --> 00:01:20,609
? Our whole universe
was in a hot, dense state ?

36
00:01:20,611 --> 00:01:24,279
? Then nearly 14 billion years
ago expansion started... Wait! ?

37
00:01:24,281 --> 00:01:25,814
? The Earth began to cool ?

38
00:01:25,816 --> 00:01:28,717
? The autotrophs began to drool,
Neanderthals developed tools ?

39
00:01:28,719 --> 00:01:30,552
? We built the Wall ?
? <i>We built the pyramids</i> ?

40
00:01:30,554 --> 00:01:33,588
? Math, Science, History,
unraveling the mystery ?

41
00:01:33,590 --> 00:01:35,524
? That all started
with a big bang ?

42
00:01:35,526 --> 00:01:37,259
? <i>Bang!</i> ?

00:01:51,091 --> 00:01:53,725
Fun onions...

47
00:01:53,727 --> 00:01:55,059
Funyuns.

48
00:01:55,061 --> 00:01:57,228
(laughs)

49
00:01:58,965 --> 00:02:00,698
Hold on.

50
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:01,733
Is that a wobble?

51
00:02:01,735 --> 00:02:03,267
Yes.

52
00:02:03,269 --> 00:02:05,837
That's definitely
a gravitational wobble.

53
00:02:05,839 --> 00:02:08,272
Uh, sorry,
I could come back.

54
00:02:08,274 --> 00:02:09,307
Oh, no, it's okay.

55
00:02:09,309 --> 00:02:10,374
I-I just found a wobble.

56
00:02:10,376 --> 00:02:12,777
Oh, do I need a mop?

57
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:15,546
It's a gravitational wobble.

58
00:02:15,548 --> 00:02:17,715
It could be a sign
of an extrasolar planet

59
00:02:17,717 --> 00:02:20,184
that may contain life
and someday be named after me.

60
00:02:20,186 --> 00:02:22,520
Oh... well, if it has life,

61
00:02:22,522 --> 00:02:24,555
maybe it already has a name,
huh?

62
00:02:24,557 --> 00:02:26,190
Yeah, but it's probably
difficult to pronounce.

63
00:02:26,192 --> 00:02:27,458
What is your name?

64
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:29,894
Rajesh Ramayan Koothrappali.

65
00:02:30,697 --> 00:02:32,063
You think it would be

66
00:02:32,065 --> 00:02:34,132
more difficult than that?

67
00:02:34,134 --> 00:02:36,000
Good point.

68
00:02:36,002 --> 00:02:37,001
And you are?

69
00:02:37,003 --> 00:02:39,604
Oh, uh, Issabella Maria
Concepcion.

70
00:02:39,606 --> 00:02:41,239
Oh, well, nice to meet you.

71
00:02:41,241 --> 00:02:42,440
Nice to meet you, too.

72
00:02:42,442 --> 00:02:44,041
You know, I have to say,

73
00:02:44,043 --> 00:02:45,510
based on the candy wrappers

74
00:02:45,512 --> 00:02:46,911
and the bags
of junk food I see

75
00:02:46,913 --> 00:02:48,379
in this trash,
I thought the person

76
00:02:48,381 --> 00:02:51,115
working here was ten years old.

77
00:02:51,117 --> 00:02:53,084
Oh, please, show me
a ten-year-old who knows

78
00:02:53,086 --> 00:02:55,586
to dip Tootsie Rolls in Nutella.

79
00:02:56,356 --> 00:02:57,889
<i>Bueno,</i> um, I'm just going

80
00:02:57,891 --> 00:02:58,956
to empty your waste paper basket

81
00:02:58,958 --> 00:03:00,158
and then I'll get
out of your way.

82
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:01,826
Oh, please, allow me.

83
00:03:04,097 --> 00:03:07,498
That's a lot of empty calories.

84
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:08,733
Thank you.

85
00:03:08,735 --> 00:03:10,067
You're welcome.

86
00:03:13,306 --> 00:03:15,506
Okay, uh, okay,

87
00:03:15,508 --> 00:03:16,874
I-I-I have to go.

88
00:03:16,876 --> 00:03:17,842
- Okay.
- Good luck

89
00:03:17,844 --> 00:03:20,678
with your, um,
space exploration.

90
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:21,679
Thank you.

91
00:03:21,681 --> 00:03:23,281
Good luck with your...

92
00:03:23,283 --> 00:03:26,450
future endeavors.

93
00:03:29,122 --> 00:03:30,188
Did it work?

94
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:32,023
Are they brain cells yet?

95
00:03:32,025 --> 00:03:33,624
If you'd give me a minute,
I'll tell you.

96
00:03:33,626 --> 00:03:35,760
Oh, just let me look.

97
00:03:35,762 --> 00:03:36,794
(gasps)

98
00:03:36,796 --> 00:03:38,196
Oh, my goodness!

99
00:03:38,198 --> 00:03:40,598
I see quivering black lines.

100
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:42,133
Those must be neurons.

101
00:03:42,135 --> 00:03:44,535
Oh, they're so thick
and beautiful.

102
00:03:44,537 --> 00:03:46,437
Those are your
eyelashes, move.

103
00:03:50,243 --> 00:03:51,943
Well, Sheldon...

104
00:03:51,945 --> 00:03:54,278
I see astrocytes.

105
00:03:54,981 --> 00:03:56,830
Our combined skin cells are now

106
00:03:56,831 --> 00:03:58,263
a primitive neural network.

107
00:04:00,434 --> 00:04:03,368
I have such a profound

108
00:04:03,370 --> 00:04:04,770
sense of creation.

109
00:04:04,772 --> 00:04:05,838
I ju... it's like

110
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,172
when I hatched Sea-Monkeys,

111
00:04:07,174 --> 00:04:09,575
except that this
is from my DNA,

112
00:04:09,577 --> 00:04:10,742
so this is like...

113
00:04:10,744 --> 00:04:12,644
Me-Monkeys.

114
00:04:14,115 --> 00:04:15,881
These cells come
from both of us.

115
00:04:15,883 --> 00:04:18,117
Yeah, but Us-Monkeys
doesn't pop.

116
00:04:18,119 --> 00:04:19,718
Oh, oh, oh, oh, wait!

117
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:21,587
We-Monkeys, there you go.

118
00:04:21,589 --> 00:04:22,921
Hey.

119
00:04:22,923 --> 00:04:24,256
When can we start
running tests on it?

120
00:04:24,258 --> 00:04:26,325
No reason we can't
start right now.

121
00:04:26,327 --> 00:04:28,694
What stimulus should we
introduce it to first?

122
00:04:28,696 --> 00:04:30,529
L-Light, sound, temperature...

123
00:04:30,531 --> 00:04:32,231
Oh! Oh! Let's
expose it to images

124
00:04:32,233 --> 00:04:35,334
of me and you and see
who it likes better.

125
00:04:35,336 --> 00:04:38,637
Sheldon, this is a rudimentary
collection of neurons.

126
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:39,671
I mean, it's remarkable,

127
00:04:39,673 --> 00:04:41,039
but it's still limited
in what it can do.

128
00:04:41,041 --> 00:04:42,274
I understand.

129
00:04:42,276 --> 00:04:44,676
She's the mean one,
I'm the fun one.

130
00:04:48,182 --> 00:04:51,617
Huh, they screwed up
and gave us steamed broccoli.

131
00:04:51,619 --> 00:04:52,417
Oh, no, that's mine.

132
00:04:52,419 --> 00:04:53,418
Really?

133
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:54,653
The last green thing

134
00:04:54,655 --> 00:04:56,588
I saw you eat was a Skittle.

135
00:04:57,424 --> 00:04:58,524
Well, I can't eat

136
00:04:58,526 --> 00:04:59,558
like a ten-year-old
all the time.

137
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:01,627
You're dating somebody,
who is it?

138
00:05:01,629 --> 00:05:02,694
What?

139
00:05:02,696 --> 00:05:04,329
What are you talking about?

140
00:05:04,331 --> 00:05:05,764
You only watch what you
eat when you're afraid

141
00:05:05,766 --> 00:05:07,499
you might have
to take your shirt off.

142
00:05:08,369 --> 00:05:09,868
No, she's right.

143
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:10,969
As long as I've known you,

144
00:05:10,971 --> 00:05:12,404
you've always been
self-conscious

145
00:05:12,406 --> 00:05:14,173
about your cleavage.

146
00:05:15,142 --> 00:05:16,308
It's because you keep trying

147
00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:17,776
to stick pencils in it.

148
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:21,847
All right, fine,
don't tell us.

149
00:05:21,849 --> 00:05:23,615
There's nothing to tell.

150
00:05:23,617 --> 00:05:25,817
All right.

151
00:05:29,657 --> 00:05:31,023
How's that broccoli?

152
00:05:31,025 --> 00:05:33,058
It's gross but I have to eat it
because I met somebody.

153
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:33,825
Bam.

154
00:05:33,827 --> 00:05:35,027
Thank you.

155
00:05:35,029 --> 00:05:35,827
What's her name?

156
00:05:35,829 --> 00:05:36,828
Issabella.

157
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:38,664
Oh, did you meet
her at work?

158
00:05:38,666 --> 00:05:41,533
Yes, in the telescope room.

159
00:05:41,535 --> 00:05:43,435
Oh, so she's an astronomer?

160
00:05:44,271 --> 00:05:46,138
Yes...

161
00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:48,473
which is why she was
in the telescope room.

162
00:05:48,475 --> 00:05:49,675
Yes, this is all making sense.

163
00:05:49,677 --> 00:05:50,943
Good.

164
00:05:50,945 --> 00:05:51,910
Well, that's great, Raj.

165
00:05:51,912 --> 00:05:53,212
You must have
so much in common.

166
00:05:53,214 --> 00:05:54,513
Mm-hmm.

167
00:05:54,515 --> 00:05:55,480
So, when do we meet her?

168
00:05:55,482 --> 00:05:57,282
No, no, this is brand-new.

169
00:05:57,284 --> 00:05:59,851
We haven't even been
on a proper date yet.

170
00:05:59,853 --> 00:06:02,454
Okay, well, good luck with it.
Thank you.

171
00:06:03,757 --> 00:06:05,857
How come you
never eat broccoli?

172
00:06:06,694 --> 00:06:07,726
I'm married,

173
00:06:07,728 --> 00:06:09,695
I don't have to be attractive.

174
00:06:13,767 --> 00:06:15,334
You know, most
people don't realize

175
00:06:15,336 --> 00:06:16,668
this technique has
actually been around

176
00:06:16,670 --> 00:06:18,370
for a few years.

177
00:06:18,372 --> 00:06:20,572
Still, I can't believe
you can turn ordinary skin cells

178
00:06:20,574 --> 00:06:22,207
into functioning brain cells.

179
00:06:22,209 --> 00:06:24,176
Well, I turned this one
into a functioning boyfriend,

180
00:06:24,178 --> 00:06:25,477
so sky's the limit.

181
00:06:27,581 --> 00:06:30,082
Look, look... here I am

182
00:06:30,084 --> 00:06:33,118
standing next
to the incubator.

183
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:37,222
Uh, here is a microscopic
view of the cells.

184
00:06:37,224 --> 00:06:41,193
Look at that, put them in a tiny
Flash T-shirt and it's you.

185
00:06:41,195 --> 00:06:43,996
Oh.
Yeah, this little guy

186
00:06:43,998 --> 00:06:45,364
can already recognize

187
00:06:45,366 --> 00:06:47,099
electronically
transmitted images

188
00:06:47,101 --> 00:06:50,402
20% faster than any other
sample in Amy's lab.

189
00:06:51,238 --> 00:06:53,272
I'm running out of ways
to act excited.

190
00:06:55,509 --> 00:06:58,610
So, enough about us,
how are things going with you?

191
00:06:58,612 --> 00:07:00,379
Great, the doctor
said the baby's head

192
00:07:00,381 --> 00:07:01,580
is facing down now.

193
00:07:01,582 --> 00:07:03,015
Good, you know,

194
00:07:03,017 --> 00:07:05,684
in case the exit
isn't clearly marked.

195
00:07:05,686 --> 00:07:09,121
Yeah, I have to say,
it is nice to share

196
00:07:09,123 --> 00:07:12,257
this experience with someone
who's on the same journey.

197
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:16,995
Although right now ours
is testing off the charts

198
00:07:16,997 --> 00:07:20,098
while yours is floating
around in its own waste.

199
00:07:21,535 --> 00:07:24,603
Are you actually comparing
my human baby

200
00:07:24,605 --> 00:07:27,105
to your brain in a bowl?

201
00:07:28,142 --> 00:07:29,474
Well, I didn't
make you waddle up

202
00:07:29,476 --> 00:07:31,810
four flights of stairs
for the heck of it.

203
00:07:32,980 --> 00:07:35,747
You do realize my baby
has functioning organs

204
00:07:35,749 --> 00:07:37,349
and can recognize voices.

205
00:07:37,351 --> 00:07:40,485
Yeah, but ours can recognize
a specific data stream

206
00:07:40,487 --> 00:07:42,387
among background noise.

207
00:07:43,157 --> 00:07:44,423
Mine has a fully developed

208
00:07:44,425 --> 00:07:45,490
immune system.

209
00:07:45,492 --> 00:07:46,558
Ours doesn't need

210
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,093
an immune system
because it lives

211
00:07:48,095 --> 00:07:50,062
in a state-of-the-art
German incubator.

212
00:07:51,065 --> 00:07:52,030
Sheldon, that's enough.

213
00:07:52,032 --> 00:07:53,432
Oh, yeah, no, fine.

214
00:07:53,434 --> 00:07:55,267
Let's just agree
that both creations

215
00:07:55,269 --> 00:07:56,935
are special in their own way

216
00:07:56,937 --> 00:07:59,371
and it is foolish
to try and compare them.

217
00:07:59,373 --> 00:08:01,073
Although, we didn't need
to have sex with Howard

218
00:08:01,075 --> 00:08:02,407
for ours, so we win.

219
00:08:06,046 --> 00:08:07,846
KOOTHRAPPALI:
This is fun.

220
00:08:10,884 --> 00:08:13,552
I have never cleaned
a toilet before.

221
00:08:13,554 --> 00:08:14,586
You're kidding.

222
00:08:14,588 --> 00:08:16,188
No, I grew up with a house
full of servants

223
00:08:16,190 --> 00:08:17,689
and now I have
a cleaning lady...

224
00:08:18,359 --> 00:08:19,758
...who is a lovely woman

225
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:21,660
who I have great respect for.

226
00:08:21,662 --> 00:08:25,464
It's okay, you're allowed
to have a cleaning lady.

227
00:08:25,466 --> 00:08:26,965
Oh, good, because
she also walks my dog,

228
00:08:26,967 --> 00:08:29,434
buys my groceries
and cuts my hair.

229
00:08:30,270 --> 00:08:32,270
I think that's called a mommy.

230
00:08:33,574 --> 00:08:34,973
Uh...

231
00:08:35,809 --> 00:08:37,242
So, forgive me...

232
00:08:37,244 --> 00:08:38,543
forgive me for being nosy,

233
00:08:38,545 --> 00:08:39,911
but is-is there a wedding ring

234
00:08:39,913 --> 00:08:41,880
under those pretty
rubber gloves?

235
00:08:43,317 --> 00:08:45,550
No, not for many years.

236
00:08:45,552 --> 00:08:48,186
Oh, so, you are unencumbered?

237
00:08:48,188 --> 00:08:49,221
Just me and my son.

238
00:08:49,223 --> 00:08:51,123
I love kids,
how old is he?

239
00:08:51,125 --> 00:08:53,291
Nineteen.

240
00:08:54,428 --> 00:08:57,329
That's a cute age.

241
00:08:57,331 --> 00:09:00,031
They can do so many things.

242
00:09:00,033 --> 00:09:01,733
He's studying to be

243
00:09:01,735 --> 00:09:03,468
a lawyer at UCLA.

244
00:09:03,470 --> 00:09:04,669
That's wonderful.

245
00:09:04,671 --> 00:09:06,838
A lawyer, my sister's a lawyer.

246
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:08,874
Look at that,
we have something in common.

247
00:09:08,876 --> 00:09:10,675
Yeah, I guess we do.

248
00:09:10,677 --> 00:09:13,845
Maybe there are other things
we have in common.

249
00:09:13,847 --> 00:09:17,783
C-Come dinnertime,
do you enjoy eating food?

250
00:09:17,785 --> 00:09:20,485
<i>Ay,</i> Rajesh,

251
00:09:20,487 --> 00:09:22,788
I think you're very sweet,
but (sighs)

252
00:09:22,790 --> 00:09:25,991
I work two jobs and I don't
have time for dating.

253
00:09:25,993 --> 00:09:27,826
Yeah, sure. I understand.

254
00:09:27,828 --> 00:09:29,394
Yeah, I'm very busy, too.

255
00:09:29,396 --> 00:09:31,163
Oh, please don't take it
personal,

256
00:09:31,165 --> 00:09:32,998
I think you're a very nice man.

257
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,767
I think you're very nice
as well.

258
00:09:35,769 --> 00:09:37,636
Thank you for helping me.

259
00:09:37,638 --> 00:09:39,237
Good night, Rajesh.

260
00:09:39,239 --> 00:09:41,239
Oh, yes. Oh, okay.

261
00:09:41,241 --> 00:09:42,974
Uh...

262
00:09:42,976 --> 00:09:44,443
Good night.

263
00:09:49,283 --> 00:09:50,449
I don't know,

264
00:09:50,451 --> 00:09:53,652
maybe it's the fumes
from the urinal cakes,

265
00:09:53,654 --> 00:09:56,555
but I feel like something
is happening between us.

266
00:09:56,557 --> 00:09:59,057
(chuckles)
Good night, Rajesh.

267
00:09:59,893 --> 00:10:01,626
Okay. I'll leave.

268
00:10:01,628 --> 00:10:03,962
But just know,
every time I come in here,

269
00:10:03,964 --> 00:10:05,464
I'll be thinking of you.

270
00:10:11,805 --> 00:10:13,205
Would you look at that?

271
00:10:13,207 --> 00:10:16,241
The image we gave it
was 45% white noise,

272
00:10:16,243 --> 00:10:18,143
and it still managed
to reconstruct it.

273
00:10:18,145 --> 00:10:20,078
I've never seen results
like this before.

274
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:21,947
Yeah, we need to stop for
magnets on the way home;

275
00:10:21,949 --> 00:10:24,416
this is going right
on the fridge.

276
00:10:24,418 --> 00:10:26,451
Aren't you glad you
participated in this?

277
00:10:26,453 --> 00:10:27,752
Oh, I am.

278
00:10:27,754 --> 00:10:29,855
And you realize
what the next step is?

279
00:10:29,857 --> 00:10:31,623
(sighs) Set up
a second culture

280
00:10:31,625 --> 00:10:33,625
and try to replicate
our results.

281
00:10:33,627 --> 00:10:35,460
Uh, no.

282
00:10:35,462 --> 00:10:37,062
We lock that door,

283
00:10:37,064 --> 00:10:39,798
lower our underpants
a little and make a baby.

284
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:47,074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

285
00:10:52,177 --> 00:10:55,111
Make a baby?
What are you talking about?

286
00:10:55,113 --> 00:10:58,615
Clearly the combination
of our DNA is exceptional.

287
00:10:58,617 --> 00:11:00,984
Eh... Our child could be
the next step

288
00:11:00,986 --> 00:11:02,686
in the evolution of mankind.

289
00:11:02,688 --> 00:11:05,622
We... we'll be able to get
into any preschool we want!

290
00:11:05,624 --> 00:11:08,325
Sh-Sheldon, I'm not ready
to have a baby.

291
00:11:08,327 --> 00:11:10,861
Oh, yes, you are!
I track your cycle.

292
00:11:11,997 --> 00:11:14,197
For the next 36 hours
you're as fertile

293
00:11:14,199 --> 00:11:17,267
as a manure-covered wheat field.

294
00:11:18,437 --> 00:11:20,770
Wow. I-I can actually feel

295
00:11:20,772 --> 00:11:23,740
the egg crawling its way
back up.

296
00:11:25,377 --> 00:11:26,877
I don't understand.

297
00:11:26,879 --> 00:11:29,346
I thought you'd be thrilled
to procreate with me.

298
00:11:29,348 --> 00:11:31,047
Not right now.
Oh,

299
00:11:31,049 --> 00:11:32,816
I see what's happening here.

300
00:11:32,818 --> 00:11:35,952
You're playing hard to get.

301
00:11:35,954 --> 00:11:38,288
I'm not playing anything.

302
00:11:38,290 --> 00:11:40,290
We're not making a baby today.

303
00:11:40,292 --> 00:11:42,492
Very well.

304
00:11:44,963 --> 00:11:46,963
Oops, how clumsy of me.

305
00:11:46,965 --> 00:11:49,366
You know what? Let me get that.

306
00:11:59,177 --> 00:12:00,477
Hey.

307
00:12:00,479 --> 00:12:01,711
Where are you going?

308
00:12:01,713 --> 00:12:03,346
I...

309
00:12:03,348 --> 00:12:06,049
Did you even look at my bottom?

310
00:12:10,289 --> 00:12:11,821
Welcome.

311
00:12:13,692 --> 00:12:15,825
- What is this?
- Oh, well,

312
00:12:15,827 --> 00:12:18,261
you said you didn't have time to
go out for dinner, so I thought

313
00:12:18,263 --> 00:12:19,796
we could have one right here.

314
00:12:19,798 --> 00:12:22,332
Oh, Rajesh...
Oh, come on!

315
00:12:22,334 --> 00:12:23,466
We're in the telescope room!

316
00:12:23,468 --> 00:12:26,002
It'll be like dining
under the stars.

317
00:12:26,004 --> 00:12:27,604
Y-You see this, uh, double zero?

318
00:12:27,606 --> 00:12:31,141
When it says “01,”
that means it's twinkling.

319
00:12:36,782 --> 00:12:39,816
Sometimes it takes a while.

320
00:12:40,886 --> 00:12:42,552
Rajesh, this is so sweet,

321
00:12:42,554 --> 00:12:44,487
but you... you know I'm working.

322
00:12:44,489 --> 00:12:45,989
That's why I already
cleaned up in here

323
00:12:45,991 --> 00:12:47,657
and all the other rooms
in the hall.

324
00:12:50,495 --> 00:12:53,029
Well, I suppose that gives me
a little time.

325
00:12:53,031 --> 00:12:54,564
Oh, please sit!
(chuckles)

326
00:12:54,566 --> 00:12:58,034
I tried to cook you
a meal from your homeland.

327
00:12:58,036 --> 00:12:59,169
Oh, really?

328
00:12:59,171 --> 00:13:01,204
You made Cuban food?

329
00:13:02,274 --> 00:13:06,209
That depends-- do they have
Mexican food in Cuba?

330
00:13:09,147 --> 00:13:11,548
Now, when he said “make a baby”"

331
00:13:11,550 --> 00:13:15,051
is it possible he
meant out of Legos?

332
00:13:16,154 --> 00:13:17,854
No. He was explicit.

333
00:13:17,856 --> 00:13:20,824
Needlessly
and freakishly explicit.

334
00:13:22,361 --> 00:13:23,994
LEONARD:
Why does he need a baby?

335
00:13:23,996 --> 00:13:27,063
He's already hairless
and smells like talcum powder.

336
00:13:28,033 --> 00:13:30,300
Could you two really
have some sort of

337
00:13:30,302 --> 00:13:32,068
super-intelligent child?

338
00:13:32,070 --> 00:13:33,703
Well, there is
a genetic component,

339
00:13:33,705 --> 00:13:35,438
but that doesn't
guarantee anything.

340
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:36,873
That's true.
Sheldon's father

341
00:13:36,875 --> 00:13:39,776
once picked a fight
with a cactus.

342
00:13:39,778 --> 00:13:41,778
Yeah, but that's
just his Earth parents.

343
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:44,881
We don't know anything about
the ones that sent him here.

344
00:13:46,551 --> 00:13:49,753
LEONARD: Well, we know they were
smart enough to send him away.

345
00:13:50,756 --> 00:13:53,223
Hey, you're talking
about the person I love

346
00:13:53,225 --> 00:13:57,027
and have been avoiding
for the past three hours.

347
00:13:57,029 --> 00:13:59,229
Aw, man.

348
00:14:00,198 --> 00:14:01,431
PENNY:
Ooh!

349
00:14:01,433 --> 00:14:03,700
Sheldon gonna get some.

350
00:14:05,170 --> 00:14:07,203
Well, have fun with
whatever nightmare's

351
00:14:07,205 --> 00:14:09,439
behind door number two.

352
00:14:09,441 --> 00:14:11,174
(Leonard chuckling)

353
00:14:15,113 --> 00:14:17,313
(jazz music playing)

354
00:14:26,958 --> 00:14:29,025
Well, hello.

355
00:14:29,861 --> 00:14:32,295
Hello.

356
00:14:32,297 --> 00:14:34,531
Would you care for a brandy?

357
00:14:34,533 --> 00:14:35,865
I don't think so.

358
00:14:35,867 --> 00:14:38,702
Good choice, it's disgusting.

359
00:14:39,538 --> 00:14:43,506
Sheldon, please stop
trying to seduce me.

360
00:14:43,508 --> 00:14:44,774
Who's trying to seduce you?

361
00:14:44,776 --> 00:14:47,377
After a long day I always
turn on smooth jazz

362
00:14:47,379 --> 00:14:51,915
and spray deer musk
on my inner thighs.

363
00:14:54,186 --> 00:14:57,520
I thought it smelled
like a petting zoo in here.

364
00:14:58,390 --> 00:15:00,290
Anything you'd like to pet?

365
00:15:00,292 --> 00:15:03,693
Not my hair. There's
a lot of goop in it.

366
00:15:04,529 --> 00:15:06,429
Okay, I've had enough.

367
00:15:06,431 --> 00:15:07,597
(stammers)

368
00:15:07,599 --> 00:15:08,932
Amy, come back.

369
00:15:08,934 --> 00:15:11,434
I don't know
how to open the oysters.

370
00:15:13,905 --> 00:15:16,506
So, um, what
surprised you the most

371
00:15:16,508 --> 00:15:18,208
when you first
came to America?

372
00:15:18,210 --> 00:15:21,578
Well, I suppose
how much people care

373
00:15:21,580 --> 00:15:24,380
about Oprah's favorite things.

374
00:15:24,382 --> 00:15:25,915
I thought that, too.

375
00:15:25,917 --> 00:15:27,550
But then I got
my first waffle maker

376
00:15:27,552 --> 00:15:29,385
and never questioned her again.

377
00:15:29,387 --> 00:15:31,020
You know,

378
00:15:31,022 --> 00:15:33,590
I do have some time off
this Sunday

379
00:15:33,592 --> 00:15:35,325
if you'd like to...
WOLOWITZ: Hey! I saw your car...

380
00:15:35,327 --> 00:15:38,161
Oh, sorry.
Am I interrupting?

381
00:15:38,163 --> 00:15:38,975
Uh...

382
00:15:38,999 --> 00:15:40,999
It's okay.
Uh, I should get back to work.

383
00:15:41,299 --> 00:15:42,799
Hi. Howard Wolowitz.

384
00:15:42,801 --> 00:15:44,267
Oh. Issabella Concepcion.

385
00:15:44,269 --> 00:15:46,269
Oh, yeah, the astronomer.

386
00:15:46,271 --> 00:15:47,904
Raj told us
about you.

387
00:15:47,906 --> 00:15:51,407
Hey! Free toilet paper!

388
00:15:53,411 --> 00:15:56,479
You told him
I was an astronomer?

389
00:15:56,481 --> 00:15:57,580
Uh...

390
00:15:57,582 --> 00:15:58,715
I understand.

391
00:15:58,717 --> 00:16:00,316
Time to go.
No, p-please don't.

392
00:16:00,318 --> 00:16:02,285
It's okay, Rajesh,
I'm a grown woman.

393
00:16:02,287 --> 00:16:03,586
I don't have to waste my time

394
00:16:03,588 --> 00:16:05,421
with someone
who's embarrassed by me.

395
00:16:09,494 --> 00:16:11,327
I can keep this, right?

396
00:16:11,329 --> 00:16:13,563
Issabella!

397
00:16:13,565 --> 00:16:15,064
Issabella, wait,
wait, let me explain.

398
00:16:15,066 --> 00:16:17,567
If you are embarrassed
by what I do,

399
00:16:17,569 --> 00:16:19,836
why did you pursue me?
I'm sorry.

400
00:16:19,838 --> 00:16:22,705
Honestly, I-I didn't think
your job would bother me,

401
00:16:22,707 --> 00:16:24,040
but I guess it did.

402
00:16:24,042 --> 00:16:25,742
And I hate myself for that.

403
00:16:25,744 --> 00:16:27,210
But there's
a lot of things

404
00:16:27,212 --> 00:16:29,279
about me that would
totally embarrass you.

405
00:16:29,281 --> 00:16:30,580
I doubt that.

406
00:16:30,582 --> 00:16:32,482
Well, prepare to be mortified.

407
00:16:33,418 --> 00:16:35,652
I let my dog eat food out
of my mouth,

408
00:16:35,654 --> 00:16:38,321
not because she likes it
but because I do.

409
00:16:38,323 --> 00:16:42,492
Also, I know they're pretty,
but I'm scared of butterflies.

410
00:16:42,494 --> 00:16:44,427
Sorry, just
passing through.

411
00:16:44,429 --> 00:16:46,596
I think this fell off your cart.

412
00:16:49,267 --> 00:16:50,867
Come on. What do you say?

413
00:16:50,869 --> 00:16:52,502
Let me make it up to you.

414
00:16:52,504 --> 00:16:54,804
You're very persistent.

415
00:16:54,806 --> 00:16:57,307
It's my one move.

416
00:16:57,309 --> 00:16:59,375
Okay.

417
00:17:00,345 --> 00:17:02,178
This Sunday night,
you may take me to dinner

418
00:17:02,180 --> 00:17:03,446
at a nice restaurant.

419
00:17:03,448 --> 00:17:05,949
Great.
Where would you like to go?

420
00:17:05,951 --> 00:17:07,150
Your choice.

421
00:17:07,152 --> 00:17:09,519
It can be Pakistani food,
if you like.

422
00:17:09,521 --> 00:17:11,154
Excuse me, but I'm Indian.

423
00:17:11,156 --> 00:17:13,323
And now you know how it feels.

424
00:17:23,549 --> 00:17:26,216
So, were you turned
on even a little bit?

425
00:17:26,218 --> 00:17:27,284
It was like

426
00:17:27,286 --> 00:17:30,654
being hit on
by Rat Pack Pee-wee Herman.

427
00:17:32,625 --> 00:17:34,324
I'm sorry, is that a yes?

428
00:17:34,326 --> 00:17:36,360
No!

429
00:17:36,362 --> 00:17:37,961
Amy,

430
00:17:37,963 --> 00:17:40,497
I didn't want it
to come to this.

431
00:17:40,499 --> 00:17:42,366
But you have left me no choice

432
00:17:42,368 --> 00:17:44,301
but to employ
the most passionate,

433
00:17:44,303 --> 00:17:46,870
seductive dance known to man.

434
00:17:46,872 --> 00:17:49,506
(Spanish music playing)

435
00:17:49,508 --> 00:17:52,242
The flamenco.

436
00:17:57,416 --> 00:18:00,317
(snapping, slapping continues)

437
00:18:07,693 --> 00:18:08,759
For God's sake,

438
00:18:08,761 --> 00:18:10,928
you're ridiculous.

439
00:18:14,153 --> 00:18:17,621
You guys are aroused, right?

440
00:18:19,525 --> 00:18:21,425
(pants)
That was a close one.
