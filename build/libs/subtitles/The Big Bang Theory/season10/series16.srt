1
00:00:04,569 --> 00:00:06,569
Go!
(inhales deeply)

2
00:00:06,571 --> 00:00:07,303
Come on, Raj!

3
00:00:07,305 --> 00:00:08,204
LEONARD:
You can do this!

4
00:00:08,206 --> 00:00:09,238
There's no way.

5
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:10,340
What is happening?

6
00:00:10,342 --> 00:00:11,341
This is an Euler's Disk.

7
00:00:11,343 --> 00:00:12,342
It's a physics toy

8
00:00:12,344 --> 00:00:13,810
that demonstrates
angular momentum,

9
00:00:13,812 --> 00:00:15,979
potential energy,
and kinetic energy.

10
00:00:15,981 --> 00:00:18,147
Aw, look at you
watching sports.

11
00:00:19,017 --> 00:00:20,316
We're betting to see
if Koothrappali

12
00:00:20,318 --> 00:00:21,250
can hold his breath

13
00:00:21,252 --> 00:00:22,685
longer than the
disk can spin.

14
00:00:22,687 --> 00:00:24,187
Its weight and smoothness,

15
00:00:24,189 --> 00:00:26,756
along with the slight concavity
of the mirror, means it can spin

16
00:00:26,758 --> 00:00:28,024
for a long time.

17
00:00:28,026 --> 00:00:29,492
But Raj is from India,
which means

18
00:00:29,494 --> 00:00:31,694
he's no slouch
at holding his breath.

19
00:00:32,831 --> 00:00:34,831
Okay, I want in. Ten bucks says
I'll lose interest

20
00:00:34,833 --> 00:00:37,867
before that thing
stops spinning.

21
00:00:39,037 --> 00:00:40,903
Hey, Sheldon, I found a great
restaurant for date night.

22
00:00:40,905 --> 00:00:42,205
Kind of busy right now.

23
00:00:42,207 --> 00:00:44,741
Oh, an Euler's Disk! Fun!
Yeah, we're seeing

24
00:00:44,743 --> 00:00:46,743
if Raj can hold his
breath longer than it.

25
00:00:46,745 --> 00:00:48,711
Oh. Immature.

26
00:00:49,681 --> 00:00:50,880
How ya doing?

27
00:00:50,882 --> 00:00:51,881
Mm.

28
00:00:51,883 --> 00:00:53,216
He's not gonna make it.

29
00:00:53,218 --> 00:00:54,884
Yes, he is!
You know,

30
00:00:54,886 --> 00:00:57,553
deep-sea divers holding
their breath for several minutes

31
00:00:57,555 --> 00:00:59,489
have shown elevated markers
of a protein

32
00:00:59,491 --> 00:01:01,424
that can signal brain damage.

33
00:01:01,426 --> 00:01:04,560
Yeah, see, what's happening here
signals brain damage.

34
00:01:05,263 --> 00:01:06,295
(muffled groaning)

35
00:01:06,297 --> 00:01:07,864
My God, how long does
this thing spin for?

36
00:01:07,866 --> 00:01:11,000
Ha! You're interested!
You're out ten bucks!

37
00:01:11,002 --> 00:01:13,102
It's slowing down!
Dig deep!

38
00:01:13,104 --> 00:01:16,005
Like when we bet you couldn't
fit into Howard's pants!

39
00:01:17,776 --> 00:01:18,508
(groaning)

40
00:01:18,510 --> 00:01:19,542
He's not gonna make it!

41
00:01:19,544 --> 00:01:20,343
Yes, he is!

42
00:01:20,345 --> 00:01:21,644
Come on, Raj!
It's like

43
00:01:21,646 --> 00:01:25,081
your favorite movie!
You're just <i>Waiting to Exhale!</i>

44
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:29,652
(exhales)

45
00:01:29,654 --> 00:01:31,821
Yeah! I knew you
could do it!

46
00:01:32,857 --> 00:01:34,924
(panting):
And j.. and just so you know,

47
00:01:34,926 --> 00:01:36,759
my favorite movie...

48
00:01:36,761 --> 00:01:39,128
is <i>Princess Bride.</i>

49
00:01:40,532 --> 00:01:44,133
? Our whole universe
was in a hot, dense state ?

50
00:01:44,135 --> 00:01:47,470
? Then nearly 14 billion years
ago expansion started... Wait! ?

51
00:01:47,472 --> 00:01:49,105
? The Earth began to cool ?

52
00:01:49,107 --> 00:01:51,641
? The autotrophs began to drool,
Neanderthals developed tools ?

53
00:01:51,643 --> 00:01:54,310
? We built the Wall ?
? <i>We built the pyramids</i> ?

54
00:01:54,312 --> 00:01:56,979
? Math, Science, History,
unraveling the mystery ?

55
00:01:56,981 --> 00:01:58,514
? That all started
with a big bang ?

56
00:01:58,516 --> 00:01:59,493
? <i>Bang!</i> ?

(line ringing)
(sighs)

60
00:02:12,365 --> 00:02:14,332
Hello, Rajesh.
How are things by you?

61
00:02:14,334 --> 00:02:15,433
Good, good.

62
00:02:15,435 --> 00:02:17,602
Uh, listen,
I just wanted to let you know

63
00:02:17,604 --> 00:02:19,103
when you get
my credit card bill,

64
00:02:19,105 --> 00:02:21,005
it might be a little high
this month.

65
00:02:21,007 --> 00:02:23,274
Well, you're a grown man
with a steady job.

66
00:02:23,276 --> 00:02:27,045
Why wouldn't you spend
all your father's money?

67
00:02:27,047 --> 00:02:31,382
(chuckling): Oh, Daddy,
you're so rich and funny.

68
00:02:31,384 --> 00:02:34,552
Yeah. So what else is going on
with your life?

69
00:02:34,554 --> 00:02:37,689
Uh, well, I was dating a woman
at the university,

70
00:02:37,691 --> 00:02:39,057
but we broke up.

71
00:02:39,059 --> 00:02:40,959
I'm sorry to hear that.

72
00:02:40,961 --> 00:02:44,028
I know you are. That's why
you just bought me a new iPad.

73
00:02:45,465 --> 00:02:46,764
And before you start,

74
00:02:46,766 --> 00:02:49,834
I am not interested in
you arranging a marriage for me.

75
00:02:49,836 --> 00:02:52,236
Oh, I gave up on that
a long time ago.

76
00:02:52,238 --> 00:02:53,304
You did?

77
00:02:53,306 --> 00:02:54,672
It's too much work.

78
00:02:54,674 --> 00:02:56,107
You're an adult who can't get by

79
00:02:56,109 --> 00:02:58,176
without an allowance
from his parents.

80
00:02:58,178 --> 00:02:59,844
Women don't want that.

81
00:02:59,846 --> 00:03:03,014
Wh-What are you saying,
that y-you're giving up on me?

82
00:03:03,016 --> 00:03:05,283
What kind of father gives up
on his son?

83
00:03:05,285 --> 00:03:06,584
I have six children,

84
00:03:06,586 --> 00:03:08,886
five of whom are married
and self-sufficient.

85
00:03:08,888 --> 00:03:12,323
I don't think I'm the problem.

86
00:03:13,193 --> 00:03:14,859
I can't believe
what I'm hearing.

87
00:03:14,861 --> 00:03:17,295
This is deeply hurtful.

88
00:03:17,297 --> 00:03:18,363
You're also too sensitive.

89
00:03:18,365 --> 00:03:21,132
Women don't want that either.

90
00:03:24,537 --> 00:03:26,270
The food here's
supposed to be great.

91
00:03:26,272 --> 00:03:27,638
Don't fill up
on chips.

92
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:29,374
Oh, I won't.
I have a trick.

93
00:03:29,376 --> 00:03:31,976
I only eat
equilateral triangles.

94
00:03:33,179 --> 00:03:35,880
Isosceles, isosceles,

95
00:03:35,882 --> 00:03:38,483
oh, scalene...

96
00:03:39,319 --> 00:03:41,519
You didn't see that.

97
00:03:42,722 --> 00:03:44,455
Oh, look.

98
00:03:44,457 --> 00:03:45,823
It's Bert, at the bar.

99
00:03:45,825 --> 00:03:47,325
We should
go say hi.

100
00:03:47,327 --> 00:03:49,794
Why?

101
00:03:49,796 --> 00:03:51,729
Because that's what you do

102
00:03:51,731 --> 00:03:54,632
when you see someone you know
in a public place.

103
00:03:54,634 --> 00:03:58,803
I have multiple restraining
orders that say otherwise.

104
00:04:00,473 --> 00:04:03,241
Sheldon, there's a difference
between greeting a friend

105
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:05,610
and following a celebrity
into a bathroom.

106
00:04:06,813 --> 00:04:08,613
If the judge
couldn't explain it to me,

107
00:04:08,615 --> 00:04:10,815
I don't see how you will.

108
00:04:12,852 --> 00:04:14,552
Hi, Bert.
Hello.

109
00:04:14,554 --> 00:04:16,020
Oh, hey, guys.

110
00:04:16,022 --> 00:04:17,088
What brings you here?

111
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:19,123
Oh, we're having date night.
Nice.

112
00:04:19,125 --> 00:04:20,525
I'm meeting someone, too.

113
00:04:20,527 --> 00:04:22,060
Oh, really. Anybody we know?

114
00:04:22,062 --> 00:04:25,096
I doubt it. I met
her on G-Harmony.

115
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:28,766
That's a Web site for
geologists to find love.

116
00:04:28,768 --> 00:04:30,501
That's a real thing?

117
00:04:30,503 --> 00:04:33,604
Yeah. Their slogan is
“We're all about dating

118
00:04:33,606 --> 00:04:36,107
and not the carbon-14 kind”"

119
00:04:37,911 --> 00:04:40,211
Well, have
a lovely evening.

120
00:04:40,213 --> 00:04:42,080
Thanks. You, too.

121
00:04:43,149 --> 00:04:44,615
If you think
that's more fun than talking

122
00:04:44,617 --> 00:04:47,051
to Zachary Quinto through
a stall door, you're crazy.

123
00:04:50,056 --> 00:04:51,355
You know, we could've come
to you guys.

124
00:04:51,357 --> 00:04:52,890
You didn't have to bring
the baby here.

125
00:04:52,892 --> 00:04:54,559
Oh, it's okay. It's good
to get out of the house.

126
00:04:54,561 --> 00:04:56,094
And the car ride
puts her to sleep.

127
00:04:56,096 --> 00:04:58,629
Aw, that used to work
with Sheldon.

128
00:04:58,631 --> 00:05:01,999
Yeah, until someone left him
in the drugstore parking lot

129
00:05:02,001 --> 00:05:03,367
and he freaked out.

130
00:05:03,369 --> 00:05:05,036
Who forgot to crack the window?

131
00:05:05,805 --> 00:05:07,071
Hello!

132
00:05:07,073 --> 00:05:08,372
LEONARD: Hey.
PENNY: Oh,

133
00:05:08,374 --> 00:05:09,874
someone's been shopping
at Gucci.

134
00:05:09,876 --> 00:05:12,743
Yeah, I saw something for Halley
and I couldn't resist.

135
00:05:12,745 --> 00:05:14,579
That's so
sweet of you.

136
00:05:14,581 --> 00:05:18,416
Yeah, it's a crushed velvet
baby cape.

137
00:05:19,486 --> 00:05:22,987
Oh, no, now we have two.

138
00:05:23,890 --> 00:05:26,124
That must've been expensive.
Yeah, it was.

139
00:05:26,126 --> 00:05:29,360
But it's my father's money
and I'm mad at him.

140
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:31,496
What's going on with your dad?

141
00:05:31,498 --> 00:05:32,697
And if you really want
to hurt him,

142
00:05:32,699 --> 00:05:34,432
I look great in Chanel.
(clears throat)

143
00:05:34,434 --> 00:05:38,069
It turns out he doesn't care
if I'm married or if I'm single.

144
00:05:38,071 --> 00:05:39,904
He's basically given up on me.

145
00:05:39,906 --> 00:05:41,973
Oh, I'm sure that's not true.

146
00:05:41,975 --> 00:05:44,876
It is. He stopped trying to find
Indian girls for me to marry.

147
00:05:44,878 --> 00:05:47,111
All you did was complain
when he did that.

148
00:05:47,113 --> 00:05:50,081
Leonard, he's hurting.
Let him feel how he feels.

149
00:05:50,083 --> 00:05:51,883
Thank you, Penny.
Yeah.

150
00:05:51,885 --> 00:05:54,018
Shoes, I'm a seven-and-a-half;
boots, I'm an eight.

151
00:05:56,856 --> 00:05:59,056
...MSN Search,

152
00:05:59,058 --> 00:06:01,058
AltaVista,

153
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:04,061
and... Ask Jeeves.

154
00:06:04,063 --> 00:06:05,396
You?

155
00:06:05,398 --> 00:06:06,998
Sorry, I don't have a list

156
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,667
of defunct search engines
that I miss.

157
00:06:11,604 --> 00:06:13,437
Hey. Looks like I got stood up,

158
00:06:13,439 --> 00:06:14,972
so I'm gonna head out.

159
00:06:14,974 --> 00:06:16,474
Oh, no. Are you sure
you don't want to give her

160
00:06:16,476 --> 00:06:17,542
a few more minutes?

161
00:06:17,544 --> 00:06:20,645
Nah, G-Harmony recommends
after two hours,

162
00:06:20,647 --> 00:06:23,681
it's time to cut bait.

163
00:06:25,585 --> 00:06:26,517
I'm so sorry.

164
00:06:26,519 --> 00:06:29,253
Bert, I insist
that you join us.

165
00:06:29,255 --> 00:06:31,122
You really wouldn't mind?

166
00:06:31,124 --> 00:06:32,690
Not at all. Amy?

167
00:06:32,692 --> 00:06:33,958
Fine with me.

168
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:36,460
Thanks. I'll go grab a chair.

169
00:06:36,462 --> 00:06:39,664
Sheldon, that was so sweet
of you.

170
00:06:39,666 --> 00:06:41,866
Well, I could deduce
by his facial expression

171
00:06:41,868 --> 00:06:44,068
and body language
that he was sad.

172
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:48,339
So the part where he got
stood up didn't clue you in?

173
00:06:48,341 --> 00:06:53,344
You want me to look at him
<i>and</i> listen to him?

174
00:06:54,547 --> 00:06:57,715
My father thinks the reason
I can't make a relationship work

175
00:06:57,717 --> 00:06:59,383
is because I'm spoiled.

176
00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:08,059
I'm sorry, is he waiting
for someone to disagree?

177
00:07:08,061 --> 00:07:09,994
Just because he helps me out

178
00:07:09,996 --> 00:07:12,730
doesn't automatically mean
that I'm spoiled.

179
00:07:12,732 --> 00:07:14,452
All right, how much exactly
does he pay for?

180
00:07:16,035 --> 00:07:18,035
Okay,
I'll tell you,

181
00:07:18,037 --> 00:07:19,503
but please don't judge me.

182
00:07:19,505 --> 00:07:23,474
He pays for my car, my rent,
and my credit cards.

183
00:07:25,778 --> 00:07:28,579
I'm trying, but I'm judging.

184
00:07:29,616 --> 00:07:32,083
Maybe your dad's right.

185
00:07:32,085 --> 00:07:34,418
Yeah, women do like a man
that can support himself.

186
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:36,020
But Bernadette makes
more money than Howard.

187
00:07:36,022 --> 00:07:39,156
She basically
supports him.

188
00:07:39,158 --> 00:07:41,759
Yeah, maybe your
dad's right.

189
00:07:44,631 --> 00:07:47,531
Good question. Let's see.

190
00:07:47,533 --> 00:07:49,400
Infoseek,

191
00:07:49,402 --> 00:07:51,269
WebCrawler,

192
00:07:51,271 --> 00:07:53,170
oh, HotBot.

193
00:07:53,172 --> 00:07:55,906
Okay, literally
any other topic.

194
00:07:56,676 --> 00:07:59,844
All right.
How did you guys meet?

195
00:07:59,846 --> 00:08:02,013
Actually, we met online.

196
00:08:02,015 --> 00:08:04,015
Our-our first date
was at a coffee shop.

197
00:08:04,017 --> 00:08:07,084
Although, unlike your date,
she actually showed up.

198
00:08:08,388 --> 00:08:10,454
Oh, he looks sad again.

199
00:08:11,324 --> 00:08:14,358
Well, I really envy
your relationship.

200
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:16,927
Other than you two only
having sex once a year,

201
00:08:16,929 --> 00:08:19,530
you're the perfect couple.

202
00:08:21,034 --> 00:08:22,967
You-you know about that?

203
00:08:22,969 --> 00:08:26,170
Uh, yeah, everyone at
the university does.

204
00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:28,306
Were you aware of this?

205
00:08:28,308 --> 00:08:32,343
No. No, I only told Leonard,
Howard, Raj,

206
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:35,613
Kripke, uh, Professor Wu,
Professor Klein,

207
00:08:35,615 --> 00:08:38,582
and a lunch lady
in the cafeteria.

208
00:08:38,584 --> 00:08:42,019
How everyone else found out
is a mystery to me.

209
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:50,074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

210
00:08:52,563 --> 00:08:54,630
Why aren't you
talking to me?

211
00:08:54,632 --> 00:08:56,632
- Because I'm mad at you.
- Oh.

212
00:08:56,634 --> 00:08:59,935
Well, now I'm sorry I asked.

213
00:08:59,937 --> 00:09:01,870
Sheldon, it's humiliating.

214
00:09:01,872 --> 00:09:05,040
Thanks to you, my colleagues are
gossiping about our sex life.

215
00:09:05,042 --> 00:09:06,542
What is there to gossip about?

216
00:09:06,544 --> 00:09:08,877
We barely have one.

217
00:09:09,714 --> 00:09:12,414
That's why they're doing it!

218
00:09:15,619 --> 00:09:19,455
Is it safe to assume
you're not speaking to me again?

219
00:09:20,725 --> 00:09:23,392
If you're not answering because
you're not speaking to me,

220
00:09:23,394 --> 00:09:25,294
perhaps we could come up
with a signal!

221
00:09:25,296 --> 00:09:27,496
(door slams)

222
00:09:30,267 --> 00:09:31,967
That works!

223
00:09:34,505 --> 00:09:36,004
You don't need your dad's money.

224
00:09:36,006 --> 00:09:38,307
You can get by on your salary.
LEONARD: Yeah.

225
00:09:38,309 --> 00:09:40,476
Well, we work at the
same place as you, and

226
00:09:40,478 --> 00:09:42,077
we've always been fine.
KOOTHRAPPALI: Oh, please.

227
00:09:42,079 --> 00:09:45,414
Look in the mirror. You both
look ten years older than I do.

228
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:48,016
PENNY:
All right.

229
00:09:48,018 --> 00:09:49,351
Hang on. We can
figure this out.

230
00:09:49,353 --> 00:09:52,020
Let's just go over your
expenses. How much is your rent?

231
00:09:52,022 --> 00:09:53,856
I don't want to say.

232
00:09:53,858 --> 00:09:56,058
Is it really
that high?

233
00:09:56,060 --> 00:09:59,361
I don't want to say because
I don't know how much it is.

234
00:09:59,363 --> 00:10:01,663
You don't how much
your rent is?

235
00:10:01,665 --> 00:10:03,557
My father pays for it! Do you
know how much your rent is?!

236
00:10:03,581 --> 00:10:04,534
Yeah.

237
00:10:04,535 --> 00:10:05,834
Well, then double it,

238
00:10:05,836 --> 00:10:07,870
because my building's
a lot nicer than this dump.

239
00:10:09,006 --> 00:10:12,007
Do you know how
much your car costs?

240
00:10:12,009 --> 00:10:13,075
Not really.

241
00:10:13,077 --> 00:10:15,110
Well, how much
do you spend on food?

242
00:10:15,112 --> 00:10:18,147
The housekeeper
does the shopping.

243
00:10:18,983 --> 00:10:21,717
Oh, my God, you
really are spoiled.

244
00:10:21,719 --> 00:10:23,018
<i>I'm</i> spoiled?!

245
00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:26,722
Your baby has a cape
that costs $300!

246
00:10:32,329 --> 00:10:33,428
I'm going to bed.

247
00:10:33,430 --> 00:10:34,930
Well, wait.

248
00:10:34,932 --> 00:10:38,767
This is our first fight as
a couple who live together.

249
00:10:38,769 --> 00:10:40,035
So?

250
00:10:40,037 --> 00:10:42,304
I'm not sure of the protocol.

251
00:10:42,306 --> 00:10:43,605
Television teaches us

252
00:10:43,607 --> 00:10:45,207
that the man's supposed
to sleep on the couch,

253
00:10:45,209 --> 00:10:48,844
but of the two of us,
you're clearly more sofa-sized.

254
00:10:48,846 --> 00:10:50,712
I'm not sleeping on the couch

255
00:10:50,714 --> 00:10:53,115
'cause you don't know
what's private and what's not.

256
00:10:53,117 --> 00:10:55,150
This isn't fair.

257
00:10:55,152 --> 00:10:56,518
You've discussed aspects

258
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:58,353
of our physical relationship
with Penny.

259
00:10:58,355 --> 00:10:59,788
That's different!

260
00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:02,357
She's a close friend,
not the lady in the cafeteria

261
00:11:02,359 --> 00:11:05,194
who cuts the crust off
your sandwiches!

262
00:11:05,196 --> 00:11:06,795
That lady has a name.

263
00:11:06,797 --> 00:11:08,330
I don't know what it is,

264
00:11:08,332 --> 00:11:10,732
but one time,
I accidentally called her “Mom”.

265
00:11:13,971 --> 00:11:16,371
Sounds like you're gonna
need a cheaper place to live.

266
00:11:16,373 --> 00:11:18,540
When you moved here,
you didn't have a lot of money.

267
00:11:18,542 --> 00:11:19,608
How'd you get by?

268
00:11:19,610 --> 00:11:21,743
Well, sometimes
you can get free food

269
00:11:21,745 --> 00:11:24,613
and Wi-Fi from the neighbors.

270
00:11:24,615 --> 00:11:26,081
Just know

271
00:11:26,083 --> 00:11:29,151
you might have
to marry one of 'em.

272
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:31,720
Hey, you guys let Stuart
live with you.

273
00:11:31,722 --> 00:11:32,888
Why not Raj, too?

274
00:11:32,890 --> 00:11:35,557
What-what are you doing? I...

275
00:11:37,094 --> 00:11:40,162
I-I-I schlepped the baby over,
I brought imported beer.

276
00:11:40,164 --> 00:11:42,064
Why don't you like me?

277
00:11:42,066 --> 00:11:43,165
KOOTHRAPPALI:
Well,

278
00:11:43,167 --> 00:11:44,486
I thought
we were best friends!

279
00:11:44,510 --> 00:11:45,501
We are!

280
00:11:45,502 --> 00:11:49,037
That's why I'm sad my best
friend's gonna be homeless.

281
00:11:51,175 --> 00:11:54,276
I'm sorry, Raj. We really
just don't have the space.

282
00:11:54,278 --> 00:11:55,677
What if he lives in your garage?

283
00:11:55,679 --> 00:11:58,013
What if you stop helping?!

284
00:11:59,383 --> 00:12:02,217
Guys, I'm not living
in a garage!

285
00:12:02,219 --> 00:12:04,353
Wait. Why are we talking
about our place

286
00:12:04,355 --> 00:12:08,123
when Sheldon's old room is
sitting there perfectly empty?

287
00:12:10,261 --> 00:12:12,027
That's a great idea.

288
00:12:12,029 --> 00:12:14,463
Raj,

289
00:12:14,465 --> 00:12:17,699
if you need a place to stay,
of course you are welcome here.

290
00:12:17,701 --> 00:12:21,870
Thank you, but if I'm gonna just
take advantage of my friends,

291
00:12:21,872 --> 00:12:24,706
I might as well keep on
relying on my father.

292
00:12:24,708 --> 00:12:26,108
Okay, only if you're sure.

293
00:12:26,110 --> 00:12:27,476
(quietly):
Whew.

294
00:12:27,478 --> 00:12:29,878
Yeah.

295
00:12:30,981 --> 00:12:32,981
(knocking)
SHELDON: Amy?

296
00:12:32,983 --> 00:12:34,249
(knocking)
Amy?

297
00:12:34,251 --> 00:12:36,585
(knocking) Amy?
Yeah?

298
00:12:37,621 --> 00:12:40,389
Not exactly the welcome wagon,
but I'll take it.

299
00:12:42,326 --> 00:12:44,459
What is this?

300
00:12:44,461 --> 00:12:47,296
I'm mapping basic topics
of conversation

301
00:12:47,298 --> 00:12:49,998
and with whom
they can be discussed.

302
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:54,369
I call these circles
“Zones of Privacy”"

303
00:12:54,371 --> 00:12:55,637
Don't Google that

304
00:12:55,639 --> 00:12:58,106
unless you want to see pictures
of people's genitals.

305
00:12:58,108 --> 00:13:01,843
This circle contains
only me and you.

306
00:13:01,845 --> 00:13:04,713
It represents subjects we
only share with each other...

307
00:13:04,715 --> 00:13:08,550
details of physical intimacy,
bathroom habits.

308
00:13:08,552 --> 00:13:10,385
Although, as I'm saying it,

309
00:13:10,387 --> 00:13:14,289
I may need
to add Dr. Fink in here.

310
00:13:14,291 --> 00:13:15,691
Are you really worried

311
00:13:15,693 --> 00:13:18,026
about revealing secrets
to Stephen Hawking?

312
00:13:18,028 --> 00:13:22,664
No, I was just excited
to list him as a friend.

313
00:13:22,666 --> 00:13:25,901
Well, I do appreciate
you working on this.

314
00:13:27,671 --> 00:13:29,571
I'm sorry you were embarrassed.

315
00:13:29,573 --> 00:13:31,440
And now I understand that

316
00:13:31,442 --> 00:13:33,775
some things are just
between you and me,

317
00:13:33,777 --> 00:13:38,280
and in the event of redness
and swelling, Dr. Fink.

318
00:13:40,584 --> 00:13:42,384
What's that little dot
in the middle?

319
00:13:42,386 --> 00:13:45,620
That's reserved for thoughts
I don't share with anyone.

320
00:13:45,622 --> 00:13:49,925
Interesting. You really
have secrets you don't tell me?

321
00:13:49,927 --> 00:13:51,493
Of course.

322
00:13:51,495 --> 00:13:53,195
Can I hear one?

323
00:13:53,197 --> 00:13:55,230
No, they're private.

324
00:13:55,232 --> 00:13:59,134
Why? Are they naughty?

325
00:13:59,970 --> 00:14:02,170
A little.

326
00:14:02,172 --> 00:14:03,839
Please?

327
00:14:03,841 --> 00:14:06,041
Fine.

328
00:14:07,211 --> 00:14:09,378
Two years ago...

329
00:14:10,581 --> 00:14:13,281
...I got my driver's license.

330
00:14:14,118 --> 00:14:16,551
What?!

331
00:14:17,821 --> 00:14:19,821
Why didn't
you say anything?!

332
00:14:19,823 --> 00:14:23,225
I like being
chauffeured around.

333
00:14:23,227 --> 00:14:25,827
It makes me feel important.

334
00:14:27,464 --> 00:14:30,532
So when I got up at 4:00 a.m.
to drive you across the desert

335
00:14:30,534 --> 00:14:33,468
to an antique train museum,
I didn't have to?

336
00:14:33,470 --> 00:14:34,736
No, you didn't.

337
00:14:34,738 --> 00:14:36,538
But keep in mind,

338
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:39,708
I felt extremely important.

339
00:14:42,012 --> 00:14:44,212
(line ringing)

340
00:14:44,214 --> 00:14:45,514
(beep)

341
00:14:45,516 --> 00:14:48,016
What?!

342
00:14:48,018 --> 00:14:49,251
Hello, Father.

343
00:14:49,253 --> 00:14:50,519
We need to talk.

344
00:14:50,521 --> 00:14:51,920
All right.

345
00:14:51,922 --> 00:14:53,655
I have come
to an important decision.

346
00:14:53,657 --> 00:14:55,490
I will not be accepting
your money anymore.

347
00:14:55,492 --> 00:14:58,226
I'm a man,
and I can take care of myself.

348
00:14:58,228 --> 00:14:59,895
That's wonderful!

349
00:14:59,897 --> 00:15:01,196
Yes, that is wonderful!

350
00:15:01,198 --> 00:15:03,398
You will no longer be able
to accuse me of being spoiled!

351
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:05,300
I am so proud of you.

352
00:15:05,302 --> 00:15:06,535
Dad, I'm trying to tell you off,

353
00:15:06,537 --> 00:15:09,438
and you're ruining it
with your delight and relief.

354
00:15:10,841 --> 00:15:12,274
Sorry.

355
00:15:12,276 --> 00:15:15,410
Oh, no, my grown son is going
to stop spending all my money.

356
00:15:15,412 --> 00:15:18,346
Where did I fail as a father?!

357
00:15:18,348 --> 00:15:20,382
Yeah, that's right.

358
00:15:20,384 --> 00:15:21,917
Keep asking yourself that!

359
00:15:23,153 --> 00:15:26,688
But I still love you very much,
so don't cut me out of the will.

360
00:15:35,163 --> 00:15:36,596
Oh, you brought
your own lunch.

361
00:15:36,598 --> 00:15:37,764
Good for you.

362
00:15:37,766 --> 00:15:39,899
Yeah, I'm making a bunch
of changes.

363
00:15:39,901 --> 00:15:42,068
This morning,
I fired my dog walker.

364
00:15:42,070 --> 00:15:44,471
Oh. How's the dog gonna go
to the bathroom?

365
00:15:44,473 --> 00:15:46,039
Uh, I gave her an Imodium.

366
00:15:46,041 --> 00:15:47,807
That's tomorrow's problem.

367
00:15:49,578 --> 00:15:52,712
Excuse me. May I have
your attention, please?

368
00:15:52,714 --> 00:15:54,247
I have recently

369
00:15:54,249 --> 00:15:57,017
been made aware
that my personal relationship

370
00:15:57,019 --> 00:16:00,220
with Amy Farrah Fowler has
become water cooler gossip.

371
00:16:00,222 --> 00:16:04,124
And I just want to say,
shame on all of you.

372
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:06,793
We're scientists.

373
00:16:06,795 --> 00:16:08,061
Our minds should be focused

374
00:16:08,063 --> 00:16:10,530
on the advancement
of human knowledge,

375
00:16:10,532 --> 00:16:13,033
not the intimate details
of other people's lives.

376
00:16:13,035 --> 00:16:15,568
He's right.

377
00:16:15,570 --> 00:16:18,138
And I'm sorry for the part
I played in this.

378
00:16:18,140 --> 00:16:19,839
Thank you, Bert.

379
00:16:19,841 --> 00:16:22,942
You're a good man. That
woman who stood you up

380
00:16:22,944 --> 00:16:25,512
and humiliated you last
night really missed out.

381
00:16:26,915 --> 00:16:30,183
That doesn't paint me
in the best light.

382
00:16:30,185 --> 00:16:32,285
Oh. Oh, I'm sorry.

383
00:16:32,287 --> 00:16:37,390
Correction: That woman not only
had vigorous coitus with Bert...

384
00:16:37,392 --> 00:16:41,528
she also tipped him a
dollar for a job well done.

385
00:16:44,266 --> 00:16:46,700
- That better?
- Not really.

386
00:16:48,303 --> 00:16:51,338
All right, well, to sum up...
focus on science,

387
00:16:51,340 --> 00:16:53,573
keep your nose out
of other people's business,

388
00:16:53,575 --> 00:16:56,343
and, uh, whoa,
for a good time, call Bert.

389
00:17:03,518 --> 00:17:05,552
What brought that on?

390
00:17:05,554 --> 00:17:07,954
(sighs)
Well, last night Amy was angry

391
00:17:07,956 --> 00:17:10,457
with me because I'd been
foolishly telling people

392
00:17:10,459 --> 00:17:12,325
about certain personal matters.

393
00:17:12,327 --> 00:17:14,094
That's understandable.

394
00:17:14,096 --> 00:17:15,562
Oh, I know that now.

395
00:17:15,564 --> 00:17:17,430
At first, I thought
she was cranky

396
00:17:17,432 --> 00:17:19,899
because of her horrific
menstrual cramps, but...

397
00:17:20,869 --> 00:17:23,570
...it turns out, no, she
was genuinely mortified.
