00:00:12,024 --> 00:00:13,647
Hello.

3
00:00:13,649 --> 00:00:16,275
I'm looking for Howard Wolowitz.

4
00:00:16,474 --> 00:00:18,507
May I ask what this is about?

5
00:00:18,509 --> 00:00:19,909
No, you may not.

6
00:00:19,911 --> 00:00:21,944
Very well.

7
00:00:24,082 --> 00:00:25,715
Hi... Colonel Williams.

8
00:00:25,717 --> 00:00:27,083
How can I help you?

9
00:00:27,085 --> 00:00:28,351
O-Okay.

10
00:00:28,353 --> 00:00:31,120
Sure, I can meet with you
on Thursday.

11
00:00:31,122 --> 00:00:32,521
Caltech is fine.

12
00:00:32,523 --> 00:00:34,991
Yeah, may I ask
what this is about?

13
00:00:34,993 --> 00:00:36,359
(brief chuckle)

14
00:00:36,361 --> 00:00:38,461
I may not?

15
00:00:38,463 --> 00:00:41,464
That's what he said to me.

16
00:00:42,633 --> 00:00:44,500
Look at this.

17
00:00:44,502 --> 00:00:47,603
Elon Musk has a theory
that we're all just characters

18
00:00:47,605 --> 00:00:50,740
in some advanced civilization's
video game.

19
00:00:50,742 --> 00:00:52,641
So some alien kid spent
his money

20
00:00:52,643 --> 00:00:56,012
on the asthma-and-glasses
upgrade for me?

21
00:00:57,248 --> 00:01:01,017
Well, he doesn't say
it's a good game.

22
00:01:01,886 --> 00:01:03,853
All right, we got a problem.

23
00:01:03,855 --> 00:01:04,675
What's up?

24
00:01:04,699 --> 00:01:07,254
The Air Force contacted me
about our quantum gyroscope.

25
00:01:07,354 --> 00:01:08,184
They want to have
a meeting.

26
00:01:08,208 --> 00:01:08,792
Really?

27
00:01:08,793 --> 00:01:10,926
Yeah. This military guy
showed up at Howard's door.

28
00:01:10,928 --> 00:01:12,428
He was terrifying.

29
00:01:12,430 --> 00:01:13,763
Oh, what did he say?

30
00:01:13,765 --> 00:01:15,031
He gave me his business card

31
00:01:15,033 --> 00:01:19,035
and asked me to please
pass it along to Howard.

32
00:01:19,037 --> 00:01:21,470
That doesn't sound terrifying.

33
00:01:21,472 --> 00:01:24,006
To a white guy born here, no.

34
00:01:25,910 --> 00:01:27,743
If you are a brown guy
whose name has

35
00:01:27,745 --> 00:01:30,713
a lot of syllables in it--
terrifying.

36
00:01:31,453 --> 00:01:34,087
You realize if the military declares our
research classified,

37
00:01:34,089 --> 00:01:36,422
they can take the whole
thing away from us.

38
00:01:36,424 --> 00:01:37,757
WOLOWITZ:
And if that happens,

39
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:39,192
we'll never be able
to sell it commercially.

40
00:01:39,194 --> 00:01:40,460
There goes our big payday.
I was counting

41
00:01:40,462 --> 00:01:42,829
on that money-- I need
to make as much as my wife

42
00:01:42,831 --> 00:01:45,431
so I don't have
to try so hard in bed.

43
00:01:45,433 --> 00:01:47,133
You do that, too?

44
00:01:47,135 --> 00:01:50,003
Oh, yeah. How do you think
I stay this thin?

45
00:01:50,005 --> 00:01:53,173
Gentlemen, I think we are
losing sight of the real issue.

46
00:01:53,175 --> 00:01:56,309
We are on the precipice
of becoming faceless cogs

47
00:01:56,311 --> 00:01:58,645
in the military-industrial
complex.

48
00:01:58,647 --> 00:02:01,347
Isn't that exciting?

49
00:02:01,349 --> 00:02:02,682
You're kidding, right?

50
00:02:02,684 --> 00:02:05,652
Not at all. In <i>Star Wars,</i>
when the stormtroopers

51
00:02:05,654 --> 00:02:07,754
would march
in perfect formation,

52
00:02:07,756 --> 00:02:10,056
harassing civilians,
didn't you ever think,

53
00:02:10,058 --> 00:02:12,225
"Hey, that could be me"?

54
00:02:12,227 --> 00:02:13,893
Sheldon,
we could be contributing

55
00:02:13,895 --> 00:02:16,529
to a weapons system
that oppresses mankind

56
00:02:16,531 --> 00:02:19,132
for the next thousand years.

57
00:02:19,134 --> 00:02:21,434
Okay, Howard's on board.
What do you think, Leonard?

58
00:02:22,504 --> 00:02:26,105
? Our whole universe
was in a hot, dense state ?

59
00:02:26,107 --> 00:02:29,442
? Then nearly 14 billion years
ago expansion started... Wait! ?

60
00:02:29,444 --> 00:02:31,077
? The Earth began to cool ?

61
00:02:31,079 --> 00:02:33,613
? The autotrophs began to drool,
Neanderthals developed tools ?

62
00:02:33,615 --> 00:02:36,282
? We built the Wall ?
? <i>We built the pyramids</i> ?

63
00:02:36,284 --> 00:02:38,952
? Math, Science, History,
unraveling the mystery ?

64
00:02:38,954 --> 00:02:40,854
? That all started
with a big bang ?

65
00:02:40,856 --> 00:02:41,870
? <i>Bang!</i> ?

68
00:02:50,873 --> 00:02:53,507
I'm worried about Howard.
Ever since that guy

69
00:02:53,508 --> 00:02:55,741
from the Air Force showed up,
he's been a nervous wreck.

70
00:02:55,743 --> 00:02:57,743
All right, we work at
a giant pharmaceutical company.

71
00:02:57,745 --> 00:02:59,478
Get him some anti-anxiety meds.

72
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:01,347
He won't take any pills
that aren't chewable

73
00:03:01,349 --> 00:03:03,416
and shaped like a Flintstone.

74
00:03:03,418 --> 00:03:05,785
You know, when Leonard's
feeling anxious

75
00:03:05,787 --> 00:03:07,219
I make him take a long walk.

76
00:03:07,221 --> 00:03:08,287
Does that help?

77
00:03:08,289 --> 00:03:11,223
Well, for a while.
Then he comes back.

78
00:03:12,393 --> 00:03:13,866
I don't believe this.

79
00:03:13,890 --> 00:03:14,561
What's wrong?

80
00:03:14,562 --> 00:03:16,929
This guy from the office
just congratulated me

81
00:03:16,931 --> 00:03:18,464
on being pregnant.

82
00:03:18,466 --> 00:03:20,633
You did already know, right?

83
00:03:21,469 --> 00:03:23,703
No one at the office did.

84
00:03:23,705 --> 00:03:24,838
Did you tell
anyone?

85
00:03:24,862 --> 00:03:26,374
No.
You told me not to.

86
00:03:26,375 --> 00:03:28,341
I bet it was Barbara Chen
in retrovirus.

87
00:03:28,342 --> 00:03:30,576
She might have heard me
throwing up one morning.

88
00:03:30,578 --> 00:03:31,811
Every since she got

89
00:03:31,813 --> 00:03:34,947
the hearing aid,
she thinks she's so great.

90
00:03:35,817 --> 00:03:38,284
Why don't you want
anyone to know?

91
00:03:38,286 --> 00:03:40,019
'Cause I'm up for a major
immunotherapy study,

92
00:03:40,021 --> 00:03:41,620
and if they find out
I'm pregnant

93
00:03:41,622 --> 00:03:43,322
they might give it
to someone else.

94
00:03:43,324 --> 00:03:44,657
Would they really do that?

95
00:03:44,659 --> 00:03:46,959
I know they would-- they did it
to Barbara Chen last year

96
00:03:46,961 --> 00:03:48,661
when I told everyone
she was pregnant.

97
00:03:52,133 --> 00:03:54,967
Wail till I Snapchat that
my friends might be working

98
00:03:54,969 --> 00:03:57,703
on a top secret
government project.

99
00:03:58,673 --> 00:03:59,872
Are you crazy?

100
00:03:59,874 --> 00:04:01,340
You can't put that on Snapchat.

101
00:04:01,342 --> 00:04:05,277
Fine, I'll put it on Facebook
like a caveman.

102
00:04:07,749 --> 00:04:09,181
You know,
maybe before our meeting

103
00:04:09,183 --> 00:04:10,549
we should talk to a lawyer.

104
00:04:10,551 --> 00:04:11,984
That's not a bad idea.

105
00:04:11,986 --> 00:04:14,086
Well, you must have someone
in your family that's a lawyer.

106
00:04:14,088 --> 00:04:15,688
Why? Because I'm Jewish?

107
00:04:15,690 --> 00:04:17,723
That's like me saying,
"Hey, you're Indian.

108
00:04:17,725 --> 00:04:20,760
Doesn't your cousin work
in a call center?"

109
00:04:21,929 --> 00:04:24,964
My cousin does work
in a call center.

110
00:04:25,967 --> 00:04:29,101
And my cousin's a lawyer.

111
00:04:30,404 --> 00:04:32,638
We don't need
Howard's cousin, no.

112
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:35,307
We have me.

113
00:04:35,309 --> 00:04:37,710
You're not a lawyer, Sheldon,
you're just a know-it-all.

114
00:04:37,712 --> 00:04:39,178
I am not a know-it-all.

115
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:41,213
I'm a person
who knows lots of things

116
00:04:41,215 --> 00:04:44,650
and likes to correct
other people when they're wrong.

117
00:04:44,652 --> 00:04:46,819
That's the definition
of being a know-it-all.

118
00:04:46,821 --> 00:04:50,356
Or in German, a <i>Besserwisser.</i>

119
00:04:53,161 --> 00:04:55,494
How did you think you were
gonna hide your pregnancy?

120
00:04:55,496 --> 00:04:58,097
I had a plan-- I kept leaving
Dove Bar wrappers around

121
00:04:58,099 --> 00:05:00,332
to explain any weight gain.

122
00:05:01,569 --> 00:05:04,103
Where did you get
empty Dove Bar wrappers?

123
00:05:04,105 --> 00:05:06,772
From all the Dove Bars
I ate! I'm pregnant!

124
00:05:06,774 --> 00:05:08,808
Try to keep up!

125
00:05:10,378 --> 00:05:12,478
I'm sorry.
I-I have to go find out

126
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:13,789
if my boss knows.

127
00:05:13,790 --> 00:05:15,953
Well, whatever happens,
we're here for you.

128
00:05:15,954 --> 00:05:17,144
Thanks.
You guys are the best.

129
00:05:17,145 --> 00:05:18,952
Yeah, drive safe. We love you.
And give us a call...

130
00:05:18,953 --> 00:05:20,252
Oh, my God,
it was me, it was me!

131
00:05:20,254 --> 00:05:21,520
I'm the one who blabbed
she was pregnant!

132
00:05:21,522 --> 00:05:22,629
What?!

133
00:05:22,653 --> 00:05:23,390
I didn't mean to.
It just slipped out

134
00:05:23,391 --> 00:05:25,212
in front of her assistant
one day. I...

135
00:05:25,236 --> 00:05:25,991
I forgot my coat.

136
00:05:25,993 --> 00:05:27,893
Oh! Here's your coat, honey.

137
00:05:27,895 --> 00:05:29,895
That's such a cute jacket.

138
00:05:29,897 --> 00:05:31,263
Oh...

139
00:05:31,265 --> 00:05:33,165
God, I feel so bad--
I just lied to her.

140
00:05:33,167 --> 00:05:35,100
Oh, but you did it so well.

141
00:05:35,102 --> 00:05:36,869
That's amazing!

142
00:05:38,005 --> 00:05:39,538
It's like watching a sculptor,

143
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:42,041
but your clay was lies.

144
00:05:42,043 --> 00:05:44,243
Is that really
what's important right now?

145
00:05:44,245 --> 00:05:47,179
I mean, seriously, you have got
to let me scan your brain

146
00:05:47,181 --> 00:05:50,549
when you're being dishonest
so I can see what lights up.

147
00:05:50,551 --> 00:05:51,851
That's super helpful, Amy.

148
00:05:51,853 --> 00:05:53,752
Thanks a lot.
I can't wait to do that.

149
00:05:53,754 --> 00:05:57,223
I can see a clump of bitch cells
lightin' up from here.

150
00:06:00,261 --> 00:06:03,863
Give me a second
to call my cousin.

151
00:06:03,865 --> 00:06:06,732
I don't see how a tax lawyer
from Fort Lauderdale

152
00:06:06,734 --> 00:06:09,635
could be helpful regarding
intellectual property.

153
00:06:09,637 --> 00:06:11,437
First of all,
he's in Boca Raton,

154
00:06:11,439 --> 00:06:13,739
which is better
than Fort Lauderdale.

155
00:06:13,741 --> 00:06:15,207
But more importantly,

156
00:06:15,209 --> 00:06:18,177
he lasted two days on <i>Jeopardy,</i>

157
00:06:18,179 --> 00:06:19,645
so he's clearly a smart guy.

158
00:06:20,915 --> 00:06:22,882
(Skype ringing)

159
00:06:23,718 --> 00:06:24,850
Hello.

160
00:06:24,852 --> 00:06:26,986
Hey, Marty.
Thanks for talking to us.

161
00:06:26,988 --> 00:06:28,387
Hey, no problem.

162
00:06:28,389 --> 00:06:30,556
Thanks for going to outer space
so no matter what I do

163
00:06:30,558 --> 00:06:32,791
my mom will be
disappointed in me.

164
00:06:33,961 --> 00:06:36,929
Well, I married a little
Catholic girl, so we're even.

165
00:06:36,931 --> 00:06:39,398
Anyway,
this is Leonard and Sheldon.

166
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:41,400
The three of us came up
with the guidance system.

167
00:06:41,402 --> 00:06:43,669
- Hi. - Hello.
And this is my friend, Raj.

168
00:06:43,671 --> 00:06:45,471
Oh, I'm not on the patent.
I'm just here

169
00:06:45,473 --> 00:06:48,540
because there's a bumblebee
in my office.

170
00:06:49,443 --> 00:06:51,677
I saw it. It's big.

171
00:06:52,647 --> 00:06:54,446
Anyway,
like I said in the e-mail,

172
00:06:54,448 --> 00:06:55,881
this meeting's on Thursday.

173
00:06:55,883 --> 00:06:57,816
Do you have any advice for us?

174
00:06:57,818 --> 00:06:59,718
Well, I don't know much
about patent law.

175
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:01,420
But, uh, my advice is:

176
00:07:01,422 --> 00:07:04,056
hear them out, offer as little
information as possible,

177
00:07:04,058 --> 00:07:06,458
and whatever you do,
don't sign anything.

178
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:09,094
"Don't sign anything"?
That's your advice?

179
00:07:09,096 --> 00:07:11,330
Okay, so, uh, if
during this meeting,

180
00:07:11,332 --> 00:07:14,400
one of us were to, say,
complete an oil painting,

181
00:07:14,402 --> 00:07:18,170
you'd recommend that
we leave that unsigned?

182
00:07:18,172 --> 00:07:19,538
That's not what I meant.

183
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:20,606
That's what you said.

184
00:07:20,608 --> 00:07:21,373
That's not what I meant.

185
00:07:21,375 --> 00:07:23,442
This must be how
you practice law

186
00:07:23,444 --> 00:07:25,678
in Boca Raton, by saying
things you don't mean

187
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,546
and meaning things
you don't say.

188
00:07:27,548 --> 00:07:30,282
Howard, why is he yelling at me?

189
00:07:30,284 --> 00:07:32,284
All right, you
were on <i>Jeopardy.</i>

190
00:07:32,286 --> 00:07:35,921
Allow me to Alex Trebek this and
put it in the form of a question:

191
00:07:35,923 --> 00:07:39,391
Who has been a complete
waste of our time?

192
00:07:40,695 --> 00:07:42,094
Marty, let me call you back.

193
00:07:42,096 --> 00:07:43,996
Someday, when I'm up
on murder charges,

194
00:07:43,998 --> 00:07:46,899
you'll be hearing from me.

195
00:07:46,901 --> 00:07:49,068
You don't need him.
I'll represent you.

196
00:07:52,473 --> 00:07:54,340
Hi.
Hey. What brings you by?

197
00:07:54,342 --> 00:07:57,409
Oh, had to go to a sales seminar
on our new sleeping pill.

198
00:07:57,411 --> 00:07:58,249
Oh. How was it?

199
00:07:58,273 --> 00:07:59,012
Great.

200
00:07:59,013 --> 00:07:59,811
Fell asleep?

201
00:07:59,835 --> 00:08:01,448
In, like, two minutes. Yeah.

202
00:08:01,449 --> 00:08:04,049
So, how is everything
going around here?

203
00:08:04,051 --> 00:08:06,652
Are you still upset about people
finding out you're pregnant?

204
00:08:06,654 --> 00:08:08,520
I'm furious.

205
00:08:08,522 --> 00:08:10,255
Sure, sure.

206
00:08:10,257 --> 00:08:12,691
Uh, did you ever figure out
who told?

207
00:08:12,693 --> 00:08:14,960
No. I confronted Barbara Chen,
but she claimed

208
00:08:14,962 --> 00:08:17,162
she didn't know
what I was talking about.

209
00:08:17,164 --> 00:08:19,865
Hmm. Well, I guess it's
just gonna remain a mystery,

210
00:08:19,867 --> 00:08:21,967
you know, like whatever happened
in that seminar

211
00:08:21,969 --> 00:08:24,536
after they dimmed the lights.
(laughs)

212
00:08:24,538 --> 00:08:26,105
It had to be Barbara.

213
00:08:26,107 --> 00:08:29,108
I've been trying to figure out
a way to get back at her.

214
00:08:29,110 --> 00:08:30,209
Do you think

215
00:08:30,211 --> 00:08:31,910
using her work computer
to Google

216
00:08:31,912 --> 00:08:35,214
"how to be a prostitute"
is over the line?

217
00:08:35,216 --> 00:08:36,648
Uh, you know, when I was

218
00:08:36,650 --> 00:08:39,151
in high school, there was this girl
who was talking about me

219
00:08:39,153 --> 00:08:41,053
behind my back, so me
and all my friends,

220
00:08:41,055 --> 00:08:44,790
we cornered her in the bathroom
and <i>forgave her.</i>

221
00:08:46,527 --> 00:08:48,160
What kind of revenge is that?

222
00:08:48,162 --> 00:08:50,929
This woman screwed with my job.
She's got to pay.

223
00:08:51,766 --> 00:08:53,866
Okay, all right, honey,
you know what?

224
00:08:53,868 --> 00:08:56,969
There was something I was too
scared to tell you yesterday,

225
00:08:56,971 --> 00:09:00,739
a-and now... I'm just balls-out
terrified to tell you, but...

226
00:09:00,741 --> 00:09:02,408
the truth is it...

227
00:09:02,410 --> 00:09:04,777
wasn't Barbara Chen, it was me.

228
00:09:04,779 --> 00:09:06,745
I'm the reason everyone knows.

229
00:09:06,747 --> 00:09:08,480
Why did you do that?

230
00:09:08,482 --> 00:09:11,383
Well, it was an accident.
I am so sorry I lied.

231
00:09:12,253 --> 00:09:13,685
Get out.

232
00:09:15,623 --> 00:09:17,523
(sighs)

233
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:22,694
Oh, you know, I also lied
about the girl in the bathroom.

234
00:09:22,696 --> 00:09:24,830
Yeah, we actually dumped
her retainer in the toilet

235
00:09:24,832 --> 00:09:27,533
and put it back in her mouth.

236
00:09:31,439 --> 00:09:35,040
I don't understand why
I can't talk at this meeting.

237
00:09:35,042 --> 00:09:37,810
'Cause when you talk,
it enrages people.

238
00:09:38,679 --> 00:09:40,546
Okay.

239
00:09:40,548 --> 00:09:41,947
Quick question.

240
00:09:41,949 --> 00:09:44,083
Am I allowed
to exchange pleasantries

241
00:09:44,085 --> 00:09:45,517
upon meeting this colonel?

242
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:46,685
Yes.

243
00:09:46,687 --> 00:09:48,187
Am I allowed to inform him

244
00:09:48,189 --> 00:09:52,057
that Colonel Sanders was never
actually in the military?

245
00:09:52,059 --> 00:09:53,725
I'm getting enraged.

246
00:09:53,727 --> 00:09:55,627
Fine.

247
00:09:55,629 --> 00:09:56,795
Ooh.

248
00:09:56,797 --> 00:09:58,764
Can I use text-to-speech
software?

249
00:09:58,766 --> 00:09:59,403
No!

250
00:09:59,427 --> 00:10:00,300
Don't speak.

251
00:10:00,301 --> 00:10:03,001
MALE ELECTRONIC VOICE:
Aw, nuts.

252
00:10:03,003 --> 00:10:04,470
MAN:
Gentlemen!

253
00:10:04,472 --> 00:10:06,138
I'm Colonel
Williams.

254
00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:07,606
Thank you for meeting with me.

255
00:10:07,608 --> 00:10:09,675
- Hi.
- Hello.

256
00:10:11,512 --> 00:10:14,980
So, which one of you is
the brains behind all this?

257
00:10:14,982 --> 00:10:16,815
It's a group effort,

258
00:10:16,817 --> 00:10:21,053
but I guess if we had to pick
a main brain, it would be me.

259
00:10:21,055 --> 00:10:23,322
(muffled whimper)

260
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:31,074
Advertise your product or brand here

261
00:10:32,004 --> 00:10:33,303
(machine whirring dies down)

262
00:10:33,305 --> 00:10:34,904
And because
of the quantum vortices,

263
00:10:34,906 --> 00:10:36,172
this can run perpetually?

264
00:10:36,174 --> 00:10:37,407
Exactly.

265
00:10:37,409 --> 00:10:39,275
Yeah, you have a good
grasp of the physics.

266
00:10:39,277 --> 00:10:41,371
Well, I'm a scientist
by training.

267
00:10:41,395 --> 00:10:42,246
WOLOWITZ:
Really?

268
00:10:42,247 --> 00:10:43,202
You're a physicist?

269
00:10:43,226 --> 00:10:45,010
Better. I'm an engineer.

270
00:10:50,022 --> 00:10:52,722
Where did you go to school?

271
00:10:52,724 --> 00:10:53,556
MIT.

272
00:10:53,558 --> 00:10:55,492
Oh.
Well, hey, me, too.

273
00:10:55,494 --> 00:10:56,593
I should have known.

274
00:10:56,595 --> 00:10:58,728
Behind every great invention
is an MIT mind.

275
00:11:02,134 --> 00:11:04,734
I'll cut to the chase.

276
00:11:04,736 --> 00:11:06,536
The Air Force
believes there's an application

277
00:11:06,538 --> 00:11:08,171
for this technology,

278
00:11:08,173 --> 00:11:10,306
and we're interested
in funding your research.

279
00:11:10,308 --> 00:11:13,243
Well, thanks,
but you should know

280
00:11:13,245 --> 00:11:16,746
we're a little concerned about
this being used in weapons.

281
00:11:16,748 --> 00:11:18,948
Oh, well,
let me put your mind at ease.

282
00:11:18,950 --> 00:11:21,651
What we use it for
is none of your business.

283
00:11:23,989 --> 00:11:26,890
I don't know how
I feel about this.

284
00:11:26,892 --> 00:11:29,259
Look, guys,
it's just a guidance system.

285
00:11:29,261 --> 00:11:30,894
It's not like
you're handing us

286
00:11:30,896 --> 00:11:32,729
the Death Star from <i>Star Trek.</i>

287
00:11:38,270 --> 00:11:39,703
All you need to
worry about is,

288
00:11:39,705 --> 00:11:42,272
right now, it's this big,

289
00:11:42,274 --> 00:11:46,209
and we need it to be...
this big.

290
00:11:46,211 --> 00:11:48,878
That's a
lot less big.

291
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:53,550
Yes, it's...
this much less big.

292
00:11:53,552 --> 00:11:56,019
I'm not even sure
that's possible.

293
00:11:56,021 --> 00:11:58,188
Well, I ran it
by some colleagues at MIT,

294
00:11:58,190 --> 00:12:00,857
and they thought they could
get it done in four months.

295
00:12:00,859 --> 00:12:01,970
Four months?

296
00:12:01,994 --> 00:12:03,861
Yeah, we'll do it
in two! (laughs)

297
00:12:03,862 --> 00:12:05,829
Hi. I'm Dr. Sheldon Cooper.

298
00:12:05,831 --> 00:12:07,897
I'm the actual brains
behind this project.

299
00:12:07,899 --> 00:12:09,899
Also, engineers aren't
real scientists,

300
00:12:09,901 --> 00:12:11,434
MIT's a trade school,

301
00:12:11,436 --> 00:12:14,704
and the Death Star is
from <i>Star Wars,</i> not <i>Star Trek!</i>

302
00:12:14,706 --> 00:12:16,840
But otherwise,

303
00:12:16,842 --> 00:12:19,743
thank you for your service.

304
00:12:22,581 --> 00:12:24,080
(knock at door)

305
00:12:24,082 --> 00:12:25,815
Hi.

306
00:12:25,817 --> 00:12:28,852
Howard told me you were working
late, so I brought dinner.

307
00:12:28,854 --> 00:12:31,654
Oh, thanks. You know, I just
wanted to get some work done

308
00:12:31,656 --> 00:12:32,822
without people
congratulating me

309
00:12:32,824 --> 00:12:34,224
about the baby
every five minutes.

310
00:12:34,226 --> 00:12:35,825
I spent my day
alone in the lab

311
00:12:35,827 --> 00:12:38,595
waiting for a rat
to die of anthrax.

312
00:12:38,597 --> 00:12:42,031
Did you come here
to bring me dinner or to gloat?

313
00:12:42,033 --> 00:12:45,368
Well, I came to see
how you were feeling,

314
00:12:45,370 --> 00:12:47,337
but I'm guessing
still angry?

315
00:12:47,339 --> 00:12:48,705
I'm sorry.

316
00:12:48,707 --> 00:12:51,107
My boss wants to meet with me,
and I'm stressing.

317
00:12:51,109 --> 00:12:53,676
You really think they're gonna
start treating you differently?

318
00:12:53,678 --> 00:12:55,145
Are you kidding?

319
00:12:55,147 --> 00:12:57,080
I've always been
treated differently!

320
00:12:57,082 --> 00:12:59,115
Look at me!
Listen to me!

321
00:12:59,117 --> 00:13:01,417
I mean, the first thought
when you see me isn't,

322
00:13:01,419 --> 00:13:03,119
"That's a scientist."

323
00:13:03,121 --> 00:13:06,156
It's, "I wonder if her mommy
knows where she is."

324
00:13:08,226 --> 00:13:12,262
I am really regretting
that I got you a Happy Meal.

325
00:13:14,599 --> 00:13:16,699
I've worked so hard
to get where I am,

326
00:13:16,701 --> 00:13:19,235
and I don't want
to get sent back to square one

327
00:13:19,237 --> 00:13:20,804
because I'm pregnant.

328
00:13:20,806 --> 00:13:22,338
I understand how you feel.

329
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:23,637
Thank you.

330
00:13:23,661 --> 00:13:24,675
I wish there were

331
00:13:24,676 --> 00:13:26,709
some way I could make it better.

332
00:13:26,711 --> 00:13:29,145
Well, you brought me
French fries. That's a start.

333
00:13:29,147 --> 00:13:33,817
Uh, actually, I got you apple
slices 'cause you're pregnant.

334
00:13:34,653 --> 00:13:36,653
Apple slices?

335
00:13:36,655 --> 00:13:40,123
What kind of lunatic goes
to McDonald's and gets fruit?!

336
00:13:40,125 --> 00:13:42,125
I'll be right back.

337
00:13:42,127 --> 00:13:44,160
And a chocolate shake!

338
00:13:47,699 --> 00:13:50,066
(door opens)

339
00:13:50,068 --> 00:13:51,701
- Hi.
- Hello.

340
00:13:51,703 --> 00:13:53,536
What are you doing?

341
00:13:53,538 --> 00:13:56,806
Oh, Leonard's mad at me,
so I'm making him lemon bars.

342
00:13:56,808 --> 00:14:00,043
Does he even
like lemon bars?

343
00:14:00,045 --> 00:14:02,178
Not really.

344
00:14:02,180 --> 00:14:05,448
But I'm mad at him, too,
so lemon bars it is.

345
00:14:06,284 --> 00:14:08,151
Something happen
at the meeting?

346
00:14:08,153 --> 00:14:10,486
They made me promise
I wouldn't talk.

347
00:14:10,488 --> 00:14:11,596
And you talked?

348
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:12,823
Well, now, see?

349
00:14:12,824 --> 00:14:15,124
You knew what was gonna
happen. Why didn't they?

350
00:14:15,126 --> 00:14:17,627
Anyway, now we're committed
to completing this project

351
00:14:17,629 --> 00:14:19,596
in a ridiculously
short time frame,

352
00:14:19,598 --> 00:14:21,231
and everyone's
upset with me.

353
00:14:21,233 --> 00:14:23,199
Well, if it makes you
feel any better,

354
00:14:23,201 --> 00:14:24,634
Bernadette's mad at me, too.

355
00:14:24,636 --> 00:14:26,736
Mm. If it makes <i>you</i>
feel any better,

356
00:14:26,738 --> 00:14:29,672
a parasitoid wasp known
as <i>Oobius depressus</i>

357
00:14:29,674 --> 00:14:32,108
has been rediscovered
after 101 years

358
00:14:32,110 --> 00:14:34,477
of presumed extinction.

359
00:14:35,313 --> 00:14:37,480
Why would that
make me feel better?

360
00:14:37,482 --> 00:14:41,317
Why would your Bernadette
thing make me feel better?

361
00:14:41,319 --> 00:14:42,886
At least mine
was educational.

362
00:14:42,888 --> 00:14:44,921
Okay. Never mind.

363
00:14:44,923 --> 00:14:46,456
Look, I'm sorry.

364
00:14:46,458 --> 00:14:49,058
Tell me why
Bernadette is upset with you.

365
00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:51,861
Well, I told people at work
that she's pregnant.

366
00:14:51,863 --> 00:14:53,930
She wasn't ready
for them to know.

367
00:14:53,932 --> 00:14:55,398
Why would you do that?

368
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:57,467
Well, it just slipped out.
I feel terrible.

369
00:14:57,469 --> 00:14:59,569
See, that's exactly
what happened to me,

370
00:14:59,571 --> 00:15:02,805
except that I said it on
purpose, and I have no regrets.

371
00:15:05,076 --> 00:15:07,477
Is it even possible
to get this done in two months?

372
00:15:07,479 --> 00:15:09,312
Well, maybe. I don't know.
We'll have to work

373
00:15:09,314 --> 00:15:11,447
12 hours a day,
seven days a week.

374
00:15:11,449 --> 00:15:14,250
Which means I won't be able to
make Penny breakfast every day,

375
00:15:14,252 --> 00:15:15,852
and she'll realize
my brioche French toast

376
00:15:15,854 --> 00:15:18,721
was the only thing
keeping her in the marriage.

377
00:15:18,723 --> 00:15:20,323
I love your
French toast.

378
00:15:20,325 --> 00:15:21,724
Oh, thanks, man.

379
00:15:21,726 --> 00:15:25,795
So, why did you guys
even agree to the deadline?

380
00:15:25,797 --> 00:15:27,363
We didn't. Sheldon did.

381
00:15:27,365 --> 00:15:28,496
And you just let him?

382
00:15:28,497 --> 00:15:31,335
Well, the colonel said it was
for the good of the country,

383
00:15:31,336 --> 00:15:32,468
and the funding
is substantial.

384
00:15:32,470 --> 00:15:34,170
No, but mostly, there
was an awkward pause,

385
00:15:34,172 --> 00:15:37,173
and I broke it
by saying, "Okay."

386
00:15:37,175 --> 00:15:41,311
So I guess I won't be
seeing you guys for a while.

387
00:15:41,313 --> 00:15:42,506
Oh, looks like it.

388
00:15:42,530 --> 00:15:43,480
Wow.

389
00:15:43,481 --> 00:15:46,249
You're going off to work with
the military, leaving me behind.

390
00:15:46,251 --> 00:15:49,419
Now I know how
all those army wives feel.

391
00:15:49,421 --> 00:15:51,821
Would you stop?

392
00:15:51,823 --> 00:15:53,957
We're just gonna be on
the other side of campus.

393
00:15:53,959 --> 00:15:56,592
And right here.

394
00:15:56,594 --> 00:16:00,964
You are a deeply silly man.

395
00:16:02,133 --> 00:16:04,667
He is so afraid of his feelings.

396
00:16:09,607 --> 00:16:10,965
Oh, hi.

397
00:16:10,988 --> 00:16:12,442
Got a minute?

398
00:16:12,444 --> 00:16:14,944
Yeah, come on in.

399
00:16:15,981 --> 00:16:18,081
I just wanted to apologize.

400
00:16:18,083 --> 00:16:20,483
I know what you did
was an accident.

401
00:16:20,485 --> 00:16:23,653
Oh, thank you,
and I'm sorry I lied about it.

402
00:16:23,655 --> 00:16:25,922
For what it's worth,
you're a great liar.

403
00:16:25,924 --> 00:16:27,991
Oh, that's what Amy said.

404
00:16:27,993 --> 00:16:30,626
So what's going on with
the research project?

405
00:16:30,628 --> 00:16:32,929
Are they gonna
let you run it?

406
00:16:32,931 --> 00:16:35,098
Well, my boss said
he hadn't decided yet,

407
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:37,967
so I gently reminded him
that he's an old rich white guy,

408
00:16:37,969 --> 00:16:39,635
and I'm a sweet
little pregnant lady

409
00:16:39,637 --> 00:16:42,538
who's not afraid to cry
in front of a jury.

410
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:45,274
You threatened to sue?

411
00:16:45,276 --> 00:16:48,244
Hey, I learned a long time ago,
when you're four feet eleven

412
00:16:48,246 --> 00:16:50,179
and eye level
with every guy's crotch,

413
00:16:50,181 --> 00:16:52,615
that's where you punch.

414
00:16:52,617 --> 00:16:54,350
That's funny.

415
00:16:54,352 --> 00:16:56,786
I learned something
totally different.

416
00:16:57,956 --> 00:16:59,989
Do you know what?

417
00:16:59,991 --> 00:17:01,924
It's just a research project.

418
00:17:01,926 --> 00:17:03,526
The most important job
in the world

419
00:17:03,528 --> 00:17:04,927
is gonna be raising this child.

420
00:17:04,929 --> 00:17:07,063
It's all I need
to give my life meaning.

421
00:17:07,065 --> 00:17:09,165
Oh, that's so beautiful.

422
00:17:09,167 --> 00:17:10,967
You believe me? Oh, good.

423
00:17:10,969 --> 00:17:12,168
11 more chumps like you,

424
00:17:12,170 --> 00:17:14,370
I'll have the jury
eating out of my hand.

425
00:17:16,808 --> 00:17:19,909
I never realized
this building was classified.

426
00:17:19,911 --> 00:17:22,879
Maybe that's because
it's classified.

427
00:17:24,482 --> 00:17:27,216
Wish we weren't so far
from my parking space.

428
00:17:27,218 --> 00:17:30,019
The way you put away
those lemon bars,

429
00:17:30,021 --> 00:17:32,021
perhaps that's a good thing.

430
00:17:32,023 --> 00:17:35,525
I'd like to reinstate
the you-not-talking rule.

431
00:17:35,527 --> 00:17:38,294
Why? It clearly doesn't work.

432
00:17:39,631 --> 00:17:42,265
I guess this is it. (laughs)

433
00:17:42,267 --> 00:17:43,966
LEONARD:
Is that a retinal scanner?

434
00:17:43,968 --> 00:17:45,802
Let's find out.

BOTH:

442
00:18:14,517 --> 00:18:16,584
Oh, oh, oh, oh, guys,
