1
00:00:03,473 --> 00:00:05,179
Hey, can you help me
put some of the food out?

2
00:00:05,180 --> 00:00:07,046
Yeah. Let me finish
packing this stuff up.

3
00:00:07,048 --> 00:00:09,315
You know how Sheldon is
if he sees Christmas stuff

4
00:00:09,317 --> 00:00:10,917
lying around after New Year's.

5
00:00:10,919 --> 00:00:13,319
Yeah, but he doesn't
live here anymore.

6
00:00:13,321 --> 00:00:15,054
Well, he doesn't live at
Walmart, but he still threw

7
00:00:15,056 --> 00:00:19,292
a tantrum when he saw
Marshmallow Peeps after Easter.

8
00:00:19,294 --> 00:00:20,960
And that's the same man
who complains

9
00:00:20,962 --> 00:00:24,397
you can't find Marshmallow Peeps
after Easter.

Oh. It's Bernadette.
She says they're running late.

12
00:00:28,236 --> 00:00:29,669
"The baby threw up on Howard,

13
00:00:29,671 --> 00:00:32,605
and then Howard threw up
on Howard."

14
00:00:32,607 --> 00:00:35,741
Well, he didn't throw up
on the baby. That's a win.

- Hello.
- Hi.

17
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:40,079
Hi! Welcome back. How was Texas?

18
00:00:40,081 --> 00:00:42,782
Oh, you know. The
Lone Star state. Hmm.

19
00:00:42,784 --> 00:00:44,517
That should be its Yelp rating.

20
00:00:44,519 --> 00:00:47,687
It was not a great trip.

21
00:00:47,689 --> 00:00:48,788
Well, you're home now.

22
00:00:48,790 --> 00:00:50,156
Yeah. It is good to be home.

23
00:00:50,158 --> 00:00:53,226
I... Oh, good Lord!
Is that mistletoe?

24
00:00:53,228 --> 00:00:55,995
Don't you maniacs
own a calendar?

25
00:00:55,997 --> 00:00:59,198
I told him to take it down.
He would not listen to me.

26
00:01:00,668 --> 00:01:04,237
? Our whole universe
was in a hot, dense state ?

27
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:07,573
? Then nearly 14 billion years
ago expansion started... Wait! ?

28
00:01:07,575 --> 00:01:09,242
? The Earth began to cool ?

29
00:01:09,244 --> 00:01:11,744
? The autotrophs began to drool,
Neanderthals developed tools ?

30
00:01:11,746 --> 00:01:14,213
? We built the Wall ?
? <i>We built the pyramids</i> ?

31
00:01:14,215 --> 00:01:17,083
? Math, Science, History,
unraveling the mystery ?

32
00:01:17,085 --> 00:01:18,985
? That all started
with a big bang ?

33
00:01:18,987 --> 00:01:19,953
? <i>Bang!</i> ?

Did you at least have
a good flight down there?

37
00:01:31,801 --> 00:01:33,100
It was fine.

38
00:01:33,102 --> 00:01:35,302
Other than the weird-tasting
juice Amy gave me.

39
00:01:35,304 --> 00:01:38,005
I slept the whole way.

40
00:01:38,007 --> 00:01:41,142
So, what happened in Texas
that was so bad?

41
00:01:41,144 --> 00:01:42,576
And before our next
drive to Comic-Con,

42
00:01:42,578 --> 00:01:44,712
I need the name of that juice.

43
00:01:44,714 --> 00:01:48,482
Well, we were on our way
to my mother's house...

44
00:01:50,653 --> 00:01:54,288
<font color="#D900D9">(gasps)</font>
How did we get in the car?

46
00:01:56,826 --> 00:01:58,526
How <i>did</i> you get him
in the car?

47
00:01:58,528 --> 00:02:00,161
I rented one of those carts,

48
00:02:00,163 --> 00:02:02,430
pushed him toward the open
door and just let inertia

49
00:02:02,432 --> 00:02:04,965
take care of the rest.

50
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:09,603
So, while we're at
your mother's house,

51
00:02:09,605 --> 00:02:13,407
it might be a good time to tell
her that we're living together.

52
00:02:13,409 --> 00:02:14,942
Do we have to?

53
00:02:14,944 --> 00:02:18,179
I really don't want
to hear the religious lecture.

54
00:02:18,181 --> 00:02:20,347
Maybe there won't be one.

55
00:02:20,349 --> 00:02:22,683
<font color="#D900D9">(scoffs)</font>
There's always one.

56
00:02:22,685 --> 00:02:25,286
She gave it to my sister
about her boyfriend,

57
00:02:25,288 --> 00:02:27,188
my brother about his girlfriend,

58
00:02:27,190 --> 00:02:29,356
my father about his girlfriend.

59
00:02:30,359 --> 00:02:34,095
That one had some
un-Christian words in it.

60
00:02:34,097 --> 00:02:36,530
Well, she likes me.

61
00:02:36,532 --> 00:02:39,033
You know, there's a chance
she might be okay with it.

62
00:02:39,035 --> 00:02:41,068
Eh, I don't know.

63
00:02:41,070 --> 00:02:43,170
I am her precious little boy.

64
00:02:43,172 --> 00:02:46,874
And you <i>did</i> take my flower.

65
00:02:48,845 --> 00:02:51,746
Do boys have flowers?

66
00:02:53,807 --> 00:02:55,617
Who knows what he has
down there.

67
00:02:55,641 --> 00:02:56,752
Mm.

68
00:02:56,753 --> 00:02:58,252
Anyway...

69
00:02:58,254 --> 00:03:00,788
Thank you, God, for the food
we are about to receive

70
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:02,857
and for the nourishment
of our bodies

71
00:03:02,859 --> 00:03:04,892
and bless the hands
that prepared it.

72
00:03:04,894 --> 00:03:06,927
Amen.

73
00:03:06,929 --> 00:03:09,530
Given that your
hands prepared it,

74
00:03:09,532 --> 00:03:11,766
isn't that a little
self-serving?

75
00:03:11,768 --> 00:03:14,401
You start changing
the words to the prayers,

76
00:03:14,403 --> 00:03:18,572
next thing you know, you're
in a church with a guitar.

77
00:03:19,542 --> 00:03:22,910
Thank you for cooking,
it looks delicious.

78
00:03:22,912 --> 00:03:24,678
Oh, it's my pleasure. Mm.

79
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:26,313
I'm so glad y'all could make it.

80
00:03:26,315 --> 00:03:27,748
So, tell me,
what's going on back home?

81
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:31,318
Well, uh, Howard and Bernadette
had their baby.

82
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:33,521
<font color="#D900D9">(gasps)</font>
Oh, that's wonderful!

83
00:03:33,523 --> 00:03:38,692
Now, have they decided
to raise it Jewish or regular?

84
00:03:42,698 --> 00:03:44,965
Welcome to Texas.

85
00:03:44,967 --> 00:03:48,235
They haven't said.

86
00:03:49,338 --> 00:03:50,638
Anyway, we, uh, we also have

87
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,373
some exciting news to share.

88
00:03:52,375 --> 00:03:54,875
<font color="#D900D9">(gasps)</font> Oh, wait, wait...
I... Shouldn't we just eat?

89
00:03:54,877 --> 00:03:57,678
You know, I mean, God did take
time out of his busy schedule

90
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:59,947
to bless these Sloppy Joes.

91
00:03:59,949 --> 00:04:02,149
Come on, Shelly,
tell me your news.

92
00:04:02,151 --> 00:04:04,885
All right. This is on you.
<font color="#D900D9">(clears throat)</font>

Amy and I are living together
in sin,

94

like a couple of New Yorkers.

95
00:04:12,562 --> 00:04:16,230
Now, while you scold us, I'm
going to get a knife and a fork.

96
00:04:16,232 --> 00:04:18,265
Joe may be sloppy,
but Sheldon's not.

97
00:04:20,570 --> 00:04:22,570
Well, thank you
for letting me know,

98
00:04:22,572 --> 00:04:25,806
and I, for one, am thrilled.

99
00:04:27,343 --> 00:04:28,976
What?

100
00:04:28,978 --> 00:04:31,846
What... Where's the judgment?

101
00:04:31,848 --> 00:04:34,481
W-Where's the fire
and brimstone?

102
00:04:34,483 --> 00:04:36,617
Where's the part where you tell
us we're going to Hell

103
00:04:36,619 --> 00:04:38,118
and I say have you seen
the size of the bugs outside?

104
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:39,286
We're already there!

105
00:04:40,590 --> 00:04:43,624
Obviously, I would prefer if you
weren't living out of wedlock,

106
00:04:43,626 --> 00:04:45,893
but given
your special circumstances,

107
00:04:45,895 --> 00:04:48,929
I'm very happy for you.

108
00:04:50,666 --> 00:04:55,102
And what "special circumstances"
are those?

109
00:04:55,104 --> 00:04:58,005
Oh, boy, I think it's
about to get bad.

110
00:04:59,208 --> 00:05:01,508
Shelly, how do I put this?

111
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:04,144
By your third birthday,
you had memorized

112
00:05:04,146 --> 00:05:07,181
over a thousand different kinds
of trains,

113
00:05:07,183 --> 00:05:09,450
and I never imagined

114
00:05:09,452 --> 00:05:13,854
a woman getting aboard
any of them.

115
00:05:16,726 --> 00:05:19,927
What, so... You thought
I was going to be alone

116
00:05:19,929 --> 00:05:21,729
for the rest of my life?

117
00:05:21,731 --> 00:05:23,898
No! Just for the middle part.

118
00:05:25,067 --> 00:05:27,501
'Cause at the end
I assumed there'd be nurses.

119
00:05:29,038 --> 00:05:31,472
Well, this is highly insulting.

120
00:05:31,474 --> 00:05:33,207
Sheldon, don't overreact.

121
00:05:33,209 --> 00:05:35,276
I'm the child
she was worried about?

122
00:05:35,278 --> 00:05:36,610

intellectual wattage

124
00:05:38,347 --> 00:05:40,581
couldn't power a potato clock,

125
00:05:40,583 --> 00:05:42,349
if I spotted them the potato.

Well, I was in my room,

130
00:05:52,995 --> 00:05:54,895
I couldn't hear
what they were saying.

131
00:05:56,866 --> 00:05:59,199

what are you doing?

always thought I was.

the tighty-whities on your head
ain't changing my mind.

143
00:06:49,385 --> 00:06:52,453
We're ignoring
the fins... Okay.

144
00:06:52,455 --> 00:06:55,189
Yeah. And I don't understand
why you're taking her side.

145
00:06:55,191 --> 00:06:58,192
By being my girlfriend, she's
saying you're a weirdo, too.

146
00:06:58,194 --> 00:07:00,361
I don't think that's
what she's saying.

And...?

148
00:07:01,764 --> 00:07:04,531
That's exactly
what she was saying.

149

150
00:07:08,204 --> 00:07:09,870

Well, after that,
Sheldon and I

154
00:07:16,323 --> 00:07:17,990
got out of the
house for a while.

155
00:07:17,992 --> 00:07:20,426
Well, first we buttered my feet
to get the swim fins off,

156
00:07:20,428 --> 00:07:21,760
and then we went out.

157

What about the woman who just
buttered your big flat feet?

165
00:07:45,152 --> 00:07:47,953
I was going chronologically.

166
00:07:47,955 --> 00:07:49,888
You're right between
Koothrappali's father

167
00:07:49,890 --> 00:07:52,925
and Omar, the one-eyed
Sparkletts guy.

Well, let's try to not let it
ruin the rest of our trip.

169

never mentioned

00:07:57,498 --> 00:08:00,265
us living together
in the first place.

171
00:08:00,267 --> 00:08:01,900
She was gonna find out
eventually.

172
00:08:01,902 --> 00:08:03,135
Disagree.

173
00:08:03,137 --> 00:08:05,404
We've known about evolution
since 1859.

174
00:08:05,406 --> 00:08:09,341
She still believes in Noah
and his amazing zoo boat.

175
00:08:10,377 --> 00:08:11,710
This could have all been avoided

176
00:08:11,712 --> 00:08:13,378
if you'd only listened to me.

177
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:16,048
Sheldon,

178
00:08:16,050 --> 00:08:18,196
I knew your mother was fine
with us living together

179
00:08:18,197 --> 00:08:20,130
because I already
told her we were.

180
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:23,575
Why would you do that?

181
00:08:23,773 --> 00:08:25,473
This was a potential issue,

182
00:08:25,475 --> 00:08:27,208
so I got out ahead of it

183
00:08:27,210 --> 00:08:29,978
and I managed
the situation for you.

184
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:33,548
You "managed the situation."

185
00:08:33,550 --> 00:08:34,749
That's right.

186
00:08:34,751 --> 00:08:37,685
So my mother thought I was
incapable of finding a mate,

187
00:08:37,687 --> 00:08:40,989
and my mate thinks I'm incapable
of running my own life.

188
00:08:40,991 --> 00:08:43,057
Not your whole life!

189
00:08:43,059 --> 00:08:44,892
I mean, science.
You got that.

190
00:08:44,894 --> 00:08:47,495
Organizing your sock drawer,
you're the king.

191
00:08:48,531 --> 00:08:51,332
But understanding
how other people are feeling,

192
00:08:51,334 --> 00:08:53,368
that's a weak spot for you.

193
00:08:53,370 --> 00:08:54,936
I have gotten
much better at that.

194
00:08:54,938 --> 00:08:58,373
Have you?
How am I feeling right now?

195
00:08:58,375 --> 00:09:00,541
What the... How should I know?

196
00:09:01,478 --> 00:09:04,846
Excited? Itchy?
Give me the first letter.

197
00:09:04,848 --> 00:09:07,915
You and I are in
a relationship.

198
00:09:07,917 --> 00:09:09,884
I help you with
your shortcomings,

199
00:09:09,886 --> 00:09:12,120
and you help me with mine.

200
00:09:12,122 --> 00:09:13,721
How would you feel
if I contacted

201
00:09:13,723 --> 00:09:15,390
your mother behind your back?

202
00:09:15,392 --> 00:09:19,260
Delighted that you showed any
interest in my family at all?

203
00:09:19,262 --> 00:09:20,695
"Delighted"?

204
00:09:20,697 --> 00:09:23,164
What... Not if I guessed
for a hundred years.

Hi.
Hey, guys.

207
00:09:27,804 --> 00:09:29,971
Hey.
Hi. There's the little family!

208
00:09:29,973 --> 00:09:32,206
Hello.
Hello.

209
00:09:33,643 --> 00:09:35,443
And their Sherpas.
Mm-hmm.

210
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:38,680
The baby's asleep,
can we put her in your room?

211
00:09:38,682 --> 00:09:40,315
Yeah. Go ahead.
Do you need help?

212
00:09:40,317 --> 00:09:42,183
No. I got it.

213
00:09:42,185 --> 00:09:44,452
Doubtfire, Poppins, follow me.

214
00:09:47,190 --> 00:09:48,623
Sorry we're late.

215
00:09:48,625 --> 00:09:50,858
Oh, it's no problem, Amy and
Sheldon were just telling us

216
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:52,126
about their trip to Texas.

217
00:09:52,128 --> 00:09:53,328
Yeah. Here.

218
00:09:53,330 --> 00:09:54,495
I'll catch you up.

219
00:09:54,497 --> 00:09:56,564
<font color="#D900D9">(gasps)</font>
How did we get in the car?

220
00:09:56,566 --> 00:09:57,598
Stop.

221
00:09:59,035 --> 00:10:01,636
Okay. They told Mary
they were living together,

222
00:10:01,638 --> 00:10:03,805
there was a fight, he
got his feelings hurt,

223
00:10:03,807 --> 00:10:04,819
then he put underwear
on his head...

224
00:10:04,843 --> 00:10:05,774
On purpose,

225
00:10:05,775 --> 00:10:08,409
not the way it used to
happen in high school.

226
00:10:08,411 --> 00:10:12,747
I was acting odd
intentionally.

227
00:10:12,749 --> 00:10:15,216
Really? So you can control it?

228
00:10:17,787 --> 00:10:19,220
Okay. Then what happened?

229
00:10:19,222 --> 00:10:21,422
Well, there's really
not much left to tell.

230
00:10:21,424 --> 00:10:23,991
I decided that my mother
views me as a child

231
00:10:23,993 --> 00:10:26,027
because I never went through
a rebellious phase,

232
00:10:26,029 --> 00:10:28,463
so, I got an earring.

233
00:10:28,465 --> 00:10:31,666
<font color="#0CEC0C">(click, then Sheldon screams)</font>

234
00:10:31,668 --> 00:10:34,202

take it out.

236
00:10:36,906 --> 00:10:39,574

<font color="#0CEC0C">(screams)</font>

238
00:10:42,278 --> 00:10:45,713
And here we are.

239
00:10:45,715 --> 00:10:47,048
What did we miss?

240
00:10:47,050 --> 00:10:49,784
I couldn't explain it
if I tried.

241
00:10:58,145 --> 00:11:01,713
So tell me, how did Sheldon
look with an earring?

242
00:11:01,715 --> 00:11:03,448
Like the pirate who helps
the other pirates

243
00:11:03,450 --> 00:11:07,052
connect to the Internet.

244
00:11:07,788 --> 00:11:09,154
So what did you
and Leonard do?

245
00:11:09,156 --> 00:11:11,623
Actually, we got in
a pretty nasty fight.

246
00:11:11,625 --> 00:11:13,425
It might've been
the worst one we've ever had.

247
00:11:13,427 --> 00:11:14,459
Oh, my God,
what happened?

248
00:11:14,461 --> 00:11:16,094
Well, we had started

249
00:11:16,096 --> 00:11:18,297
binge-watching
<i>Luke Cage</i> together,

250
00:11:18,299 --> 00:11:20,632
and it was kind of
our thing, and then,

251
00:11:20,634 --> 00:11:24,736
I find out that she watched
two episodes without me.

252
00:11:24,738 --> 00:11:29,508
It's like I was excited
for a present and got socks.

253
00:11:30,511 --> 00:11:32,144
I don't understand how
that turns into

254
00:11:32,146 --> 00:11:33,812
the worst fight of your life.

255
00:11:33,814 --> 00:11:36,114
I don't understand
what's wrong with socks.

256
00:11:36,116 --> 00:11:38,183
To be fair,
we may have been on edge

257
00:11:38,185 --> 00:11:39,918
because of the Christmas tree.

258
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:42,054
What happened
with the tree?

Oh, yeah?

262
00:11:50,197 --> 00:11:54,333
And you thought Spock ears
were only good for Comic-Con.

263
00:11:54,335 --> 00:11:55,934
Hey, hey, I just found a farm

264
00:11:55,936 --> 00:11:57,936
where they let you chop down
your own tree.

265
00:11:57,938 --> 00:12:03,575
Oh cool, I'll be like
a pointy-eared Paul Bunyan.

266
00:12:10,751 --> 00:12:13,318
Stupid idea.

267
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:15,620
No, what's stupid is a physicist

00:12:15,622 --> 00:12:17,622

when you swing an axe,

269
00:12:17,624 --> 00:12:20,692
you don't let go.

270
00:12:20,694 --> 00:12:23,829
For the tenth time,
my mittens were slippery!

271
00:12:23,831 --> 00:12:25,130
Ugh.

272
00:12:25,132 --> 00:12:28,567
It's 70 degrees,
you didn't need mittens.

273
00:12:28,569 --> 00:12:31,870
You know how easily I blister.

274
00:12:31,872 --> 00:12:33,872
Yes, yes,
you bruise, you peel.

275
00:12:33,874 --> 00:12:37,776
It's like I'm married
to an old piece of fruit.

276
00:12:37,778 --> 00:12:40,212
Look, we could keep fighting
and let it ruin our night,

277
00:12:40,214 --> 00:12:43,081
or-or we can stop
and try to salvage the evening.

278
00:12:43,083 --> 00:12:45,217

in asking for a break.

Not funny.

343
00:16:02,983 --> 00:16:06,084
She's tired, that was funny.

344
00:16:07,187 --> 00:16:10,322
Everyone's a better mom
than me.

345
00:16:10,324 --> 00:16:12,557
Oh, don't take it so personally,

346
00:16:12,559 --> 00:16:15,860
maybe your baby's just a jerk.

Wait, so how does
the story end?

349
00:16:22,703 --> 00:16:26,137
Is the baby a jerk
or is Bernadette a bad mother?

350
00:16:27,341 --> 00:16:28,840
Sheldon!

351
00:16:28,842 --> 00:16:30,075
W-What?

352
00:16:30,077 --> 00:16:31,176
Is there
another twist coming?

353
00:16:31,178 --> 00:16:33,144
Is the baby
not theirs at all?

354
00:16:34,781 --> 00:16:35,880
Ignore him.

355
00:16:35,882 --> 00:16:37,749
How did you get
the baby to stop crying?

356
00:16:37,751 --> 00:16:41,119
Oh, I just talked to her.

357
00:16:41,121 --> 00:16:46,057
I've been told the sound of
my voice puts people to sleep.

358
00:16:49,630 --> 00:16:51,730
You poor things,
you must be exhausted.

359
00:16:51,732 --> 00:16:55,900
It has been hard to sleep
with all the crying.

How can she hate me?

362
00:17:03,844 --> 00:17:06,945
I make her food
in my chest!

363
00:17:08,649 --> 00:17:13,318
It's like hating
a frozen yogurt machine.

364
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:16,354
She doesn't hate you,
stop saying that.

365
00:17:16,356 --> 00:17:19,891
Now you hate me too!

366
00:17:19,893 --> 00:17:22,394
Shh, I don't hate you.

371
00:17:35,575 --> 00:17:39,277
It says here that
up to 80% of new mothers

372
00:17:39,279 --> 00:17:40,945
experience baby blues.

373
00:17:40,947 --> 00:17:42,580
And that
the best thing to do

374
00:17:42,582 --> 00:17:45,250
is reassure them that
they're doing a good job.

375
00:17:45,252 --> 00:17:46,217
Bernadette,

376
00:17:46,219 --> 00:17:50,522
you are doing
a good job.

377
00:17:50,524 --> 00:17:53,858
Thank you, Sheldon,
I'm feeling better now.

378
00:17:53,860 --> 00:17:55,460
Thank you, Internet.

379
00:17:55,462 --> 00:17:57,162
I'm telling you,
with the right YouTube video,

380
00:17:57,164 --> 00:17:59,831
I can give Howard
a vasectomy.

381
00:18:02,402 --> 00:18:04,436
So things started
to turn around?

382
00:18:04,438 --> 00:18:07,839
Yeah, eventually I figured out
how to get the baby to sleep.

383
00:18:07,841 --> 00:18:11,509
Please tell me you didn't use
Amy's magic juice.

This is new.

391

I didn't know
what else to do.

392
00:18:45,378 --> 00:18:47,645
It worked.

393
00:18:47,647 --> 00:18:50,682
Well, I'd say that's
thinking outside the box,

It's fine.
<font color="#D900D9">(chuckles)</font>

401
00:19:09,102 --> 00:19:11,002
Is it okay if I get some sleep?

00:19:11,004 --> 00:19:12,837
Yeah, go ahead.

We love you, too.

I can't believe
you fit in the crib.

411
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:43,434
I could take a bath
in the sink.

412
00:19:44,638 --> 00:19:47,071
I don't, but I can.

413
00:19:48,108 --> 00:19:49,941
So how were your holidays?

Oh, thank you for asking.

went to visit my grandmother.

She's in Bakersfield.
