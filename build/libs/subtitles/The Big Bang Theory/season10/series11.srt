2
00:00:03,254 --> 00:00:04,114
Hey, Stuart.

3
00:00:04,115 --> 00:00:04,877
What are you doing here?

4
00:00:04,901 --> 00:00:06,583
Oh, I'm living here again.

5
00:00:06,584 --> 00:00:09,885
Do, uh, Howard
and Bernadette know?

6
00:00:09,887 --> 00:00:13,422
Or is like a possum
in the walls kind of thing?

7
00:00:14,258 --> 00:00:17,059
No. I needed
a place to stay,

8
00:00:17,061 --> 00:00:18,293
and with the baby coming,

9
00:00:18,295 --> 00:00:20,262
I figured they could
use some extra help.

10
00:00:20,264 --> 00:00:22,598
Hey, tomorrow, who wants
to paint the nursery?

11
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:23,628
I'll do it.

12
00:00:23,629 --> 00:00:25,433
Why do you get to do it?
I'm the artist.

13
00:00:25,703 --> 00:00:28,704
Just because you're starving
doesn't make you an artist.

14
00:00:28,706 --> 00:00:32,040
Just because I look sickly
doesn't mean I'm starving.

15
00:00:32,042 --> 00:00:34,176
BERNADETTE:
Howard?

16
00:00:34,178 --> 00:00:36,345
I think I'm in labor.

17
00:00:36,347 --> 00:00:38,313
Oh. Oh, okay. Okay.

18
00:00:38,315 --> 00:00:40,215
Uh, uh, uh,
I can do this.

19
00:00:40,217 --> 00:00:41,650
We have a plan.

20
00:00:41,652 --> 00:00:43,518
Somebody please
tell me the plan!

21
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:45,053
I'll get the
hospital bag.

22
00:00:45,055 --> 00:00:45,765
I'll pull the van up.

23
00:00:45,789 --> 00:00:46,890
Meet you outside
in two minutes.

24
00:00:46,891 --> 00:00:49,358
Team Baby, go!
(grunting)

25
00:00:52,263 --> 00:00:53,829
WOLOWITZ:
<i>Oh, man.</i>

26
00:00:53,831 --> 00:00:55,297
This is really
happening.

27
00:00:55,299 --> 00:00:56,999
You doin' okay?

28
00:00:57,001 --> 00:00:58,600
Here comes another contraction.

29
00:00:58,602 --> 00:00:59,968
Let's pick it up!

30
00:00:59,970 --> 00:01:01,436
All right, hold on.

31
00:01:01,438 --> 00:01:03,272
I'm gonna drive
like we do in India.

32
00:01:03,274 --> 00:01:07,943
(horn honking) Get out of my way,
you syphilitic dogs!

33
00:01:09,313 --> 00:01:11,040
Stop that!
This isn't India.

34
00:01:11,064 --> 00:01:11,981
Fine.

35
00:01:11,982 --> 00:01:16,885
What do one point three billion
people know about having babies?

36
00:01:16,887 --> 00:01:19,388
Sorry. I know you were just
trying to help.

37
00:01:20,090 --> 00:01:21,356
I love you.

38
00:01:21,358 --> 00:01:23,992
I love you, too.
We're good.

39
00:01:23,994 --> 00:01:27,629
? Our whole universe
was in a hot, dense state ?

40
00:01:27,631 --> 00:01:30,966
? Then nearly 14 billion years
ago expansion started... Wait! ?

41
00:01:30,968 --> 00:01:32,601
? The Earth began to cool ?

42
00:01:32,603 --> 00:01:35,170
? The autotrophs began to drool,
Neanderthals developed tools ?

43
00:01:35,172 --> 00:01:37,806
? We built the Wall ?
? <i>We built the pyramids</i> ?

44
00:01:37,808 --> 00:01:40,475
? Math, Science, History,
unraveling the mystery ?

45
00:01:40,477 --> 00:01:42,377
? That all started
with a big bang ?

46
00:01:42,379 --> 00:01:43,633
? <i>Bang!</i> ?

50

Wake up.

51
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:01,499
Wh... What's wrong?

52
00:02:01,501 --> 00:02:03,268
It's midnight.

53
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:04,769
Happy birthday.

(loud honking)

56
00:02:12,279 --> 00:02:17,182
Okay, you can have
this back in the morning.

57
00:02:17,184 --> 00:02:20,151
This is for you.

58
00:02:20,153 --> 00:02:21,519
I was going to wrap it,

59
00:02:21,521 --> 00:02:24,389
but touching Scotch tape
gives me the heebie-jeebies.

60
00:02:24,391 --> 00:02:27,859
I'll put in on the list
with peaches and felt.

61
00:02:29,529 --> 00:02:31,596
What is this?

62
00:02:31,598 --> 00:02:35,066
A functional MRI
of my brain.

63
00:02:35,068 --> 00:02:39,137
I did Sudoku before they
took it so I'd be ripped.

64
00:02:39,139 --> 00:02:42,173
I love it. Thank you.

65
00:02:42,175 --> 00:02:43,475
And it's not just an MRI.

66
00:02:43,477 --> 00:02:45,043
The orbitofrontal
cortex is lit up

67
00:02:45,045 --> 00:02:47,245
because I was
thinking of you.

68
00:02:47,247 --> 00:02:49,681
Sheldon!

69
00:02:53,253 --> 00:02:56,387
We seem to be moving on
to the annual coitus portion

70
00:02:56,389 --> 00:02:57,989
of your birthday
festivities.

71
00:02:57,991 --> 00:03:00,191
Is that okay?

72
00:03:00,193 --> 00:03:03,027
I didn't put on my come-hither
plaid PJ's for nothing.

73
00:03:05,031 --> 00:03:07,398
You hate Scotch tape,
but you love Scotch plaid.

74
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:09,767
You are a mystery.

PENNY: Guys, wake up!

76
00:03:18,778 --> 00:03:20,545
Bernadette's
having her baby!

77
00:03:20,547 --> 00:03:22,413
LEONARD: Come on, we're going
to the hospital!

78
00:03:22,415 --> 00:03:24,449
(quietly): I guess... I guess
we should stop.

79
00:03:24,451 --> 00:03:26,384
Yeah. I'm afraid so.

80
00:03:28,155 --> 00:03:30,555
Childbirth,
looming coitus?

81
00:03:30,557 --> 00:03:33,224
This is a banner night
for female genitals.

82
00:03:35,896 --> 00:03:37,862
Now I see
three of you.

83
00:03:37,864 --> 00:03:41,599
Do we know the father, or is
this some <i>Mamma Mia</i> nonsense?

84
00:03:41,601 --> 00:03:44,102
I'm the father.

85
00:03:44,104 --> 00:03:46,905
Okay, Dad, how far apart
are the contractions?

86
00:03:46,907 --> 00:03:49,774
No idea.
Ask him.

87
00:03:49,776 --> 00:03:51,476
12 minutes.

88
00:03:51,478 --> 00:03:53,711
12 minutes?
Why are you here?

89
00:03:53,713 --> 00:03:56,114
Aren't we supposed to get here
an hour and a half early?

90
00:03:56,116 --> 00:03:59,250
This is a hospital,
not the airport.

91
00:04:00,187 --> 00:04:02,387
I'm sorry.
It's our first time.

92
00:04:02,389 --> 00:04:03,521
It's okay.

93
00:04:03,523 --> 00:04:05,723
This little one will be
here before you know it.

94
00:04:05,725 --> 00:04:07,592
Do we know what
we're having?

95
00:04:07,594 --> 00:04:09,160
No, we're keeping it
a surprise.

96
00:04:09,162 --> 00:04:11,262
Old school. Nice.

97
00:04:11,264 --> 00:04:14,265
Not <i>that</i> old school.
He knows.

98
00:04:14,267 --> 00:04:18,136
(sing-songy): You see, I was
at the doctor's office,

99
00:04:18,138 --> 00:04:21,306
the folder was right there,
so I took a peek.

100
00:04:21,308 --> 00:04:23,541
(imitating Koothrappali):
And talking like this

101
00:04:23,543 --> 00:04:26,678
doesn't make it less creepy.

102
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:27,946
Sweetheart, go home.

103
00:04:27,948 --> 00:04:29,414
Come back when
the contractions

104
00:04:29,416 --> 00:04:31,115
are five minutes
apart for an hour.

105
00:04:31,117 --> 00:04:32,317
KOOTHRAPPALI:
I'm sorry.

106
00:04:32,319 --> 00:04:33,551
That's ambiguous.

107
00:04:33,553 --> 00:04:35,987
Is it five minutes apart
starting at the top of the hour,

108
00:04:35,989 --> 00:04:37,288
or five minutes apart starting

109
00:04:37,290 --> 00:04:41,392
with the first contraction, so
essentially, like, 65 minutes?

110
00:04:41,394 --> 00:04:44,329
I'm just throwing
this out there,

111
00:04:44,331 --> 00:04:47,732
but home births are
very popular these days.

112
00:04:50,637 --> 00:04:52,804
Sheldon, what took you so long?

113
00:04:52,806 --> 00:04:54,405
Wolowitz might
hand out cigars.

114
00:04:54,407 --> 00:04:56,074
I had to find my bubble gum

115
00:04:56,076 --> 00:04:59,544
cigar so I could join in
without looking foolish.

116
00:04:59,546 --> 00:05:01,713
Damn, I need my inhaler.

117
00:05:01,715 --> 00:05:02,880
Just don't smoke.

118
00:05:02,882 --> 00:05:04,782
No, I went down
the stairs too fast.

119
00:05:04,784 --> 00:05:06,251
(ringtone playing)

120
00:05:06,253 --> 00:05:07,685
Hey.

121
00:05:07,687 --> 00:05:09,754
Don't come to the hospital.
We're headed home.

122
00:05:09,756 --> 00:05:12,156
Oh, that was fast.
Did she sneeze the baby out?

123
00:05:12,158 --> 00:05:15,260
We showed up too early.
We'll keep you posted.

124
00:05:15,262 --> 00:05:16,861
Okay, well, we'll

125
00:05:16,863 --> 00:05:18,263
talk to you guys later. Bye.

126
00:05:18,265 --> 00:05:21,065
She said not to come.
It's gonna be a while.

127
00:05:21,067 --> 00:05:23,701
(sighs) Well, first deliveries
can be slow.

128
00:05:23,703 --> 00:05:27,338
I am starting to rethink the
Flash onesie I bought this kid.

129
00:05:28,008 --> 00:05:30,275
I found it,
but it's empty.

130
00:05:30,277 --> 00:05:32,277
Well, it doesn't matter. We're
not going to the hospital now.

131
00:05:32,279 --> 00:05:34,879
Are you sure?
I'd really like to.

132
00:05:35,715 --> 00:05:39,183
Well, should we,
uh, head back up?

133
00:05:39,185 --> 00:05:41,352
PENNY:
Come on, guys.

134
00:05:41,354 --> 00:05:43,554
We're all awake. Why don't we go
to a diner or something?

135
00:05:43,556 --> 00:05:45,189
Oh, uh, I don't know.

136
00:05:45,191 --> 00:05:48,760
Sheldon, you don't want
to do that, do you?

137
00:05:48,762 --> 00:05:50,094
It doesn't matter what I want.

138
00:05:50,096 --> 00:05:52,463
It's your birthday. You decide.
PENNY: Oh, my God!

139
00:05:52,465 --> 00:05:54,732
It's your birthday!
Let's do something fun.

140
00:05:54,734 --> 00:05:55,767
- Uh...
- Well,

141
00:05:55,769 --> 00:05:56,601
we could go to a bar.

142
00:05:56,603 --> 00:05:59,103
Well...

143
00:05:59,105 --> 00:06:01,873
Okay, I can breathe again.
Babe, they want to have sex.

144
00:06:01,875 --> 00:06:03,708
PENNY:
Oh, of course!

145
00:06:03,710 --> 00:06:07,745
The annual birthday
booty spectacular!

146
00:06:07,747 --> 00:06:09,580
That's a bit childish,
isn't it?

147
00:06:09,582 --> 00:06:12,684
I'm sorry, and what flavor is
your bubble gum cigar?

148
00:06:12,686 --> 00:06:17,722
Grape. I find it
the most mild.

149
00:06:17,724 --> 00:06:20,391
All right, well,
you two go have fun.

150
00:06:23,663 --> 00:06:27,231
If we find my backup inhaler,
maybe we can get frisky.

151
00:06:27,233 --> 00:06:30,968
Oh, you sexy,
wheezy little man.

152
00:06:33,573 --> 00:06:35,373
Do you really need
to record this?

153
00:06:35,375 --> 00:06:38,009
KOOTHRAPPALI:
You'll be happy I did.

154
00:06:38,011 --> 00:06:41,713
(sing-songy): Okay, little one,
here we are back at home

155
00:06:41,715 --> 00:06:43,848
because you weren't quite ready
to come out yet.

156
00:06:43,850 --> 00:06:47,085
You wanted to make an entrance.
I get it.

157
00:06:48,988 --> 00:06:52,190
And here's your daddy.

158
00:06:52,192 --> 00:06:54,892
When he tries to tell
you he used to be cool,

159
00:06:54,894 --> 00:06:57,462
you can see he wasn't.

160
00:06:59,833 --> 00:07:01,999
All right,
enough with the camera.

161
00:07:02,001 --> 00:07:04,135
Well, this is not for me.
This is for the baby.

162
00:07:04,137 --> 00:07:06,170
Some day she's gonna
want to see this.

163
00:07:06,172 --> 00:07:08,106
I'm sorry.

164
00:07:08,108 --> 00:07:10,441
<i>Who's</i> gonna want to see this?

165
00:07:11,478 --> 00:07:16,381
I... I said “she,”
but lots of things are she--

166
00:07:16,383 --> 00:07:17,615
boats

167
00:07:17,617 --> 00:07:18,783
and cars,

168
00:07:18,785 --> 00:07:21,652
whales.
Like, “Thar she blows.”

169
00:07:23,590 --> 00:07:25,189
You're doing great.

170
00:07:26,059 --> 00:07:27,925
Raj!

171
00:07:27,927 --> 00:07:29,494
Well, okay,
I'm gonna sign off now.

172
00:07:29,496 --> 00:07:31,963
This next part may contain
some adult language.

173
00:07:31,965 --> 00:07:33,331
How could you?!

174
00:07:33,333 --> 00:07:35,366
We made it this
far without knowing,

175
00:07:35,368 --> 00:07:37,034
and you ruined it!

176
00:07:37,036 --> 00:07:38,636
Well, you guys have no idea
how hard it is

177
00:07:38,638 --> 00:07:40,938
to know something like this
and not say it!

178
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:43,408
You told me it was a girl,
and I didn't say it.

179
00:07:43,410 --> 00:07:45,076
Raj!
You were supposed

180
00:07:45,078 --> 00:07:46,644
to keep that to yourself.

181
00:07:46,646 --> 00:07:51,015
Oh, yeah. I guess it is hard.

182
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:56,254
So... (laughs)

183
00:07:56,256 --> 00:07:57,955
...where were we?

184
00:07:57,957 --> 00:07:59,891
Well, I believe

185
00:07:59,893 --> 00:08:02,160
we were kissing like
randy teenagers,

186
00:08:02,162 --> 00:08:06,264
and your nose was
whistling ever so slightly.

187
00:08:06,266 --> 00:08:09,000
I'm sorry.

188
00:08:09,002 --> 00:08:10,234
Oh, don't be.

189
00:08:10,236 --> 00:08:12,437
You were like a
foxy tea kettle.

190
00:08:12,439 --> 00:08:14,705
(laughs)

191
00:08:14,707 --> 00:08:17,175
Well, shall we start over?

192
00:08:17,177 --> 00:08:18,976
Very well.

193
00:08:25,518 --> 00:08:27,084
What's wrong?

194
00:08:27,086 --> 00:08:29,086
I'm not sure.

195
00:08:29,088 --> 00:08:31,389
Earlier tonight, things
began organically,

196
00:08:31,391 --> 00:08:33,057
and now it's
feeling forced,

197
00:08:33,059 --> 00:08:37,061
like all the <i>Pirates</i>
<i>of the Caribbean</i> sequels.

198
00:08:38,898 --> 00:08:40,832
Okay, that makes sense.

199
00:08:40,834 --> 00:08:43,534
I mean, the mood's
a little different now.

200
00:08:43,536 --> 00:08:44,936
We-we don't have to rush.

201
00:08:44,938 --> 00:08:47,905
Oh, I know, but Leonard and
Penny think we're doing it,

202
00:08:47,907 --> 00:08:50,274
and I don't want
to disappoint them.

203
00:08:52,479 --> 00:08:55,546
And the mood continues
to change.

204
00:08:55,548 --> 00:08:57,782
No, and also, I don't
want to disappoint you. I...

205
00:08:57,784 --> 00:09:00,017
You know, come on.
It's your birthday.

206
00:09:00,019 --> 00:09:02,186
I can soldier through this.

207
00:09:03,323 --> 00:09:04,989
H-Hold on.

208
00:09:04,991 --> 00:09:07,492
I think I might have
a little surprise

209
00:09:07,494 --> 00:09:12,296
that might help get things
back on track.

210
00:09:12,298 --> 00:09:14,398
Intriguing.

211
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:16,234
Is “back on track” a hint

212
00:09:16,236 --> 00:09:18,202
that it has something
to do with trains?

213
00:09:20,473 --> 00:09:22,907
No.

214
00:09:22,909 --> 00:09:25,610
Because if it did have to do
with trains, and you were

215
00:09:25,612 --> 00:09:27,545
gonna give...
It's not about trains!

216
00:09:27,547 --> 00:09:29,881
Oh. Not even a cozy sleeper
car on the Orient Express?

217
00:09:29,883 --> 00:09:32,083
Stop talking
about trains!

218
00:09:33,386 --> 00:09:36,387
Who's killing the mood now?

219
00:09:38,424 --> 00:09:40,725
Found the backup inhaler.
Want to have sex?

220
00:09:42,729 --> 00:09:45,329
Well, I didn't
until I heard that.

221
00:09:45,331 --> 00:09:47,598
Hang on. I'm counting.

222
00:09:48,568 --> 00:09:50,434
It's okay.
Mm.

223
00:09:52,272 --> 00:09:53,905
(knocking)

224
00:09:53,907 --> 00:09:55,973
KOOTHRAPPALI (sing-songy):
Hello!

225
00:09:55,975 --> 00:09:57,375
Howard and Bernadette
kicked me out

226
00:09:57,377 --> 00:09:59,443
because I told them
they're having a girl!

227
00:10:00,246 --> 00:10:02,747
(sing-songy):
Oopsy, I did it again.

228
00:10:04,784 --> 00:10:07,118
Maybe if we're quiet,
he'll go away.

229
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:11,355
(sing-songy): You're gonna
have to be quieter than that.

230
00:10:12,559 --> 00:10:13,925
Can I look yet?

231
00:10:13,927 --> 00:10:15,860
One second.

232
00:10:15,862 --> 00:10:18,696
(chuckles) All right,
you can open your eyes.

233
00:10:24,637 --> 00:10:26,771
I thought I'd let Harry Potter

234
00:10:26,773 --> 00:10:30,174
make things hotter.
(giggles)

235
00:10:32,111 --> 00:10:33,811
Wowza.

236
00:10:35,848 --> 00:10:38,516
I got a Gryffindor robe
for you.

237
00:10:38,518 --> 00:10:39,617
(exhales):
Oh...

238
00:10:39,619 --> 00:10:42,653
A Gryffindor sleeping
with a Hufflepuff?

239
00:10:43,489 --> 00:10:45,456
How scandalous.

240
00:10:48,094 --> 00:10:51,362
You naughty girl.

241
00:10:51,364 --> 00:10:54,365
You went to the Wizarding World
theme park without me.

242
00:10:54,367 --> 00:10:56,701
I did.

243
00:10:56,703 --> 00:10:59,036
Am I in trouble?

244
00:11:00,106 --> 00:11:01,238
Yes, you're in trouble--

245
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:03,541
you went to Wizarding World
without me!

246
00:11:03,543 --> 00:11:05,543
Wait, what just happened?

247
00:11:05,545 --> 00:11:06,711
You know

248
00:11:06,713 --> 00:11:08,579
I've been wanting to go.

249
00:11:08,581 --> 00:11:10,815
(sighs) Sheldon, do you
really want to argue with me

250
00:11:10,817 --> 00:11:12,450
on my birthday?

251
00:11:12,452 --> 00:11:14,885
Oh, you're right.

252
00:11:14,887 --> 00:11:16,821
I'm sorry.

253
00:11:18,891 --> 00:11:21,559
Ooh. Happy birthday to me.

254
00:11:24,897 --> 00:11:26,063
(knocking)

255
00:11:26,065 --> 00:11:28,466
KOOTHRAPPALI (sing-songy):
Hello...

256
00:11:30,436 --> 00:11:33,104
Is this about the baby?

257
00:11:33,106 --> 00:11:36,073
No. People just keep
kicking me out everywhere I go.

258
00:11:36,075 --> 00:11:38,175
Good. Then you're used to this.

259
00:11:39,445 --> 00:11:40,511
Hey, Bernadette's water broke!

260
00:11:40,513 --> 00:11:42,146
Come on! Everyone
to the hospital!

261
00:11:42,148 --> 00:11:44,715
AMY:
You have got to be kidding me!

262
00:11:53,434 --> 00:11:55,834
Just try to relax.
We'll be there any minute.

263
00:11:56,243 --> 00:11:57,811
Stuart, stop driving
like an old man.

264
00:11:57,812 --> 00:11:59,311
Speed it up a little.

265
00:11:59,313 --> 00:12:01,047
I'm not an old man!

266
00:12:01,049 --> 00:12:03,215
I just can't see at night.

267
00:12:04,285 --> 00:12:05,951
(groaning):
Here comes another one.

268
00:12:05,953 --> 00:12:08,954
Hey, Squinty,
the gas pedal's on the right!

269
00:12:08,956 --> 00:12:10,856
All right, hang on.

270
00:12:10,858 --> 00:12:13,659
If you see any pedestrians,
just call 'em out.

271
00:12:13,661 --> 00:12:16,162
(engine roaring)

272
00:12:17,365 --> 00:12:20,032
Howard and Bernadette's kid
might be born on your birthday.

273
00:12:20,034 --> 00:12:21,367
How cool is that?

274
00:12:21,369 --> 00:12:23,536
Yeah, but I thought this
baby was supposed to ruin

275
00:12:23,538 --> 00:12:25,538
<i>their</i> sex life, not mine.

276
00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:27,239
KOOTHRAPPALI:
This is not how

277
00:12:27,241 --> 00:12:30,009
I imagined this day going--
I should be with them right now.

278
00:12:30,011 --> 00:12:32,111
Well, it <i>is</i>
their child.

279
00:12:32,113 --> 00:12:33,345
I know that.

280
00:12:33,347 --> 00:12:35,247
But to be fair,
I've spent nine months

281
00:12:35,249 --> 00:12:37,550
helping Bernadette
get ready for this baby.

282
00:12:37,552 --> 00:12:40,352
And Howard spent five minutes
conceiving it.

283
00:12:40,354 --> 00:12:42,588
And I'm being generous.

284
00:12:43,624 --> 00:12:45,357
Five minutes?

285
00:12:45,359 --> 00:12:48,394
We must be doing it wrong.
It took us hours.

286
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:53,899
KOOTHRAPPALI:
And-and the worst part is

287
00:12:53,901 --> 00:12:57,536
that they kicked <i>me</i> out
and let Stuart stay.

288
00:12:57,538 --> 00:13:00,172
I understand, but this is
a special day for them.

289
00:13:00,174 --> 00:13:02,308
Can you just try and let it go?

290
00:13:02,310 --> 00:13:03,642
SHELDON:
She's right.

291
00:13:03,644 --> 00:13:06,846
You know, I just learned Amy
went to a theme park without me,

292
00:13:06,848 --> 00:13:08,714
but I'm not going
to ruin her birthday.

293
00:13:08,716 --> 00:13:11,517
I'll wait, and ruin
24 individual hours

294
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:13,819
sprinkled
throughout the year.

295
00:13:15,957 --> 00:13:17,723
(high-pitched):
Boop.

296
00:13:19,894 --> 00:13:21,393
(groans)

297
00:13:21,395 --> 00:13:24,530
Deep breaths,
slow breaths.

298
00:13:24,532 --> 00:13:27,700
I'm so thirsty.
Give me more ice chips.

299
00:13:27,702 --> 00:13:29,502
(crunching)

300
00:13:32,807 --> 00:13:36,675
Sorry. I... thought
these were room ice chips.

301
00:13:37,912 --> 00:13:39,912
I'll go get some more.

302
00:13:39,914 --> 00:13:41,781
Uh, Stuart, while
you're out there,

303
00:13:41,783 --> 00:13:43,549
don't come back.

304
00:13:43,551 --> 00:13:45,384
Okay.

305
00:13:45,386 --> 00:13:46,786
(chuckles)

306
00:13:47,855 --> 00:13:51,724
So, what are we gonna
name this kid?

307
00:13:51,726 --> 00:13:53,592
Now that we know
she's a girl,

308
00:13:53,594 --> 00:13:57,096
it kind of ruins my plan
for Wally Wolowitz.

309
00:13:58,366 --> 00:14:00,499
Could name her
after your mom.

310
00:14:00,501 --> 00:14:01,634
Debbie?

311
00:14:01,636 --> 00:14:03,102
(chuckles) No.

312
00:14:03,104 --> 00:14:04,904
She hated that name.

313
00:14:04,906 --> 00:14:06,505
Did she have a middle name?

314
00:14:06,507 --> 00:14:08,174
Melvina.

315
00:14:09,477 --> 00:14:12,578
Let's keep thinking.

316
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:15,281
Mm.
Ah.

317
00:14:15,283 --> 00:14:17,817
It sucks that
she's not here.

318
00:14:17,819 --> 00:14:19,418
I know.

319
00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:20,719
Hm.

320
00:14:20,721 --> 00:14:23,956
She would've been
the best grandma.

321
00:14:23,958 --> 00:14:26,091
She did always have candy
in her pocket.

322
00:14:26,093 --> 00:14:27,893
(exhales) Yeah.

323
00:14:27,895 --> 00:14:30,563
I was 20 years old
before I figured out

324
00:14:30,565 --> 00:14:33,833
Tootsie Rolls weren't
naturally warm.

325
00:14:34,969 --> 00:14:37,536
I didn't know her
five minutes and she asked,

326
00:14:37,538 --> 00:14:41,674
(like Mrs. Wolowitz): “Are you a Milky Way
or a Snickers girl?”

327
00:14:41,676 --> 00:14:45,578
Thank God you answered right,
we wouldn't be here today.

328
00:14:48,015 --> 00:14:49,982
It's hard to believe
Howard's having a kid.

329
00:14:49,984 --> 00:14:51,317
Yeah.

330
00:14:51,319 --> 00:14:53,385
Penny, you're the one who
introduced him to Bernie.

331
00:14:53,387 --> 00:14:55,888
How many times do I have
to say I'm sorry?

332
00:14:57,091 --> 00:14:59,358
It's not just Howard
and Bernadette. I mean,

333
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:01,093
look how far
we've all come.

334
00:15:01,095 --> 00:15:02,027
Hmm.
Hmm.

335
00:15:02,029 --> 00:15:03,295
You two got married.

336
00:15:03,297 --> 00:15:05,831
Sheldon and I
are living together.

337
00:15:05,833 --> 00:15:08,400
But if my mom asks,
we have bunk beds.

338
00:15:10,171 --> 00:15:12,471
Penny was a struggling
actress when we met,

339
00:15:12,473 --> 00:15:14,707
and now she's a successful
pharmaceutical rep.

340
00:15:14,709 --> 00:15:17,309
Okay, you don't have to say
“struggling” every time.

341
00:15:17,311 --> 00:15:19,979
You can just say “actress.”

342
00:15:19,981 --> 00:15:21,881
Howard went to space.

343
00:15:21,883 --> 00:15:24,149
Bernadette got
her doctorate.

344
00:15:24,151 --> 00:15:26,352
Sheldon, Howard and I are
working with the government

345
00:15:26,354 --> 00:15:28,020
on our quantum gyroscope.

346
00:15:28,022 --> 00:15:30,289
We've all come a long way.

347
00:15:30,291 --> 00:15:31,824
There's a lot
to be proud of.

348
00:15:33,261 --> 00:15:36,929
For God's sake, just drive in
the knife, why don't you!

349
00:15:38,833 --> 00:15:40,900
What's your problem?
Well, you're all thinking

350
00:15:40,902 --> 00:15:44,270
that I'm the only one who
hasn't done anything worthwhile.

351
00:15:44,272 --> 00:15:45,738
I was not thinking it.

352
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:49,975
Although, now that
you point it out, it is undeniable.

353
00:15:49,977 --> 00:15:51,710
Raj, if it's
any consolation,

354
00:15:51,712 --> 00:15:54,747
I'm no better off than
I was ten years ago.

355
00:15:54,749 --> 00:15:57,283
Oh, yay!

356
00:15:57,285 --> 00:15:59,585
I have a doctorate
in astrophysics

357
00:15:59,587 --> 00:16:01,153
and I'm every bit as awesome

358
00:16:01,155 --> 00:16:03,822
as the pasty-faced owner
of a comic book store!

359
00:16:03,824 --> 00:16:06,392
Raj! Show some compassion.

360
00:16:06,394 --> 00:16:09,428
Those are things that
we think but don't say.

361
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:14,733
Excuse me.

362
00:16:16,470 --> 00:16:17,770
Sorry, Stuart.

363
00:16:17,772 --> 00:16:20,205
Hey, I'm in a hospital
and I'm not the patient.

364
00:16:20,207 --> 00:16:22,041
I'm fine.

365
00:16:23,177 --> 00:16:24,643
Come on, Bernie, breathe.

366
00:16:24,645 --> 00:16:26,712
Remember what you learned
in birthing class.

367
00:16:26,714 --> 00:16:28,747
I remember thinking,
“This is stupid”"

368
00:16:28,749 --> 00:16:31,550
and I was right!

369
00:16:31,552 --> 00:16:33,218
Do you want me
to get the nurse?

370
00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:36,088
No! If one more person puts
their fingers near my uterus,

371
00:16:36,090 --> 00:16:39,325
I'm gonna cross my legs
and snap 'em off!

372
00:16:43,597 --> 00:16:46,165
I've come to peace with my
relationship with my parents.

373
00:16:46,167 --> 00:16:48,534
That was a big milestone for me.

374
00:16:48,536 --> 00:16:50,436
Oh, speaking of personal growth,

375
00:16:50,438 --> 00:16:53,939
I recently tried eating
Swiss chard.

376
00:16:55,242 --> 00:16:59,845
You know, I didn't swallow it,
but Amy said it counted.

377
00:17:00,815 --> 00:17:03,582
Hey.
Hey.

378
00:17:07,521 --> 00:17:09,288
Still a loser or
did you turn things around

379
00:17:09,290 --> 00:17:11,457
while you were gone?

380
00:17:13,027 --> 00:17:14,259
You know, Raj, honey,

381
00:17:14,261 --> 00:17:16,028
you're being
too hard on yourself.

382
00:17:16,030 --> 00:17:18,030
When I first met you,
you couldn't even talk to women.

383
00:17:18,032 --> 00:17:19,932
I mean, you couldn't even talk
if one was in the room.

384
00:17:19,934 --> 00:17:21,333
Oh, great, now I can say

385
00:17:21,335 --> 00:17:24,069
things like “I can't believe
you're breaking up with me.”

386
00:17:24,071 --> 00:17:27,039
“Why are you breaking up
with me?”

387
00:17:27,041 --> 00:17:30,142
“Yes, I'll still help you move”"

388
00:17:30,144 --> 00:17:32,411
Anyone else want to try?

389
00:17:32,413 --> 00:17:34,947
Uh, yeah, I got something.

390
00:17:34,949 --> 00:17:36,215
Raj,

391
00:17:36,217 --> 00:17:39,318
not everybody
could be a dog owner.

392
00:17:40,421 --> 00:17:44,723
Oh, what? Did your doggie
break up with you too?

393
00:17:45,793 --> 00:17:48,660
Hey, I bought M&Ms
at the vending machine

394
00:17:48,662 --> 00:17:49,828
and two bags came out.

395
00:17:49,830 --> 00:17:51,630
I bought the first one,

396
00:17:51,632 --> 00:17:54,099
it didn't fall.

397
00:17:54,101 --> 00:17:57,002
Here.

398
00:17:59,073 --> 00:18:01,440
She's here, the baby's here!

399
00:18:01,442 --> 00:18:03,742
- Oh! Oh.
- Congratulations!

400
00:18:03,744 --> 00:18:05,077
How's Bernadette?

401
00:18:05,079 --> 00:18:06,512
Tired, but great.

402
00:18:06,514 --> 00:18:07,679
They're both great.

403
00:18:07,681 --> 00:18:09,014
Does the baby have a name yet?

404
00:18:09,016 --> 00:18:11,483
We have named her Halley.

405
00:18:11,485 --> 00:18:13,085
- Oh!
- Oh, like Halley's comet.

406
00:18:13,087 --> 00:18:14,119
HOWARD:
Exactly.

407
00:18:14,121 --> 00:18:15,754
Also like the comet,
Bernadette said

408
00:18:15,756 --> 00:18:19,625
she's not gonna have sex
with me for another 75 years.

409
00:18:19,627 --> 00:18:23,095
That's not a real thing,
he's just joking.

410
00:18:23,097 --> 00:18:24,530
I'm gonna get back.

411
00:18:24,532 --> 00:18:26,865
Thank you for staying up,
I can't wait for Halley to meet

412
00:18:26,867 --> 00:18:28,033
her new aunts and uncles

413
00:18:28,035 --> 00:18:30,335
and godfather.

414
00:18:30,337 --> 00:18:32,271
Really?

415
00:18:32,273 --> 00:18:34,406
Of course.

416
00:18:34,408 --> 00:18:35,707
You hear that, Stuart?!

417
00:18:35,709 --> 00:18:38,877
I've got a dog and a godchild,
you have nothing!

418
00:18:42,349 --> 00:18:45,417
(babies cooing)

419
00:18:45,419 --> 00:18:48,487
Oh, look at all the babies!

420
00:18:48,489 --> 00:18:50,789
Some will be successful,

421
00:18:50,791 --> 00:18:54,960
some may be homeless.

422
00:18:54,962 --> 00:18:57,830
It's fun to think about.

423
00:18:59,567 --> 00:19:01,333
I wonder which one's Halley.

424
00:19:01,335 --> 00:19:03,135
Kind of hard to see the names.

425
00:19:03,137 --> 00:19:05,571
Mm, that one kind of
looks like Bernadette.

426
00:19:05,573 --> 00:19:07,172
They all look the same to me.

427
00:19:07,174 --> 00:19:08,340
KOOTHRAPPALI:
Guys,

428
00:19:08,342 --> 00:19:09,675
she's my goddaughter,

429
00:19:09,677 --> 00:19:12,344
I think I'll know
when I see her.

430
00:19:12,346 --> 00:19:14,613
(baby cries loudly
like Mrs. Wolowitz)

431
00:19:22,679 --> 00:19:24,846
That one.

432
00:19:33,255 --> 00:19:35,156
Well, that was quite a day.

433
00:19:35,157 --> 00:19:37,223
It was.

434
00:19:37,225 --> 00:19:38,925
Bernadette had her baby,

435
00:19:38,927 --> 00:19:40,860
I made it to Wizarding World,

436
00:19:40,862 --> 00:19:42,629
and now it is time to complete

437
00:19:42,631 --> 00:19:44,864
your birthday celebration.

438
00:19:44,866 --> 00:19:46,032
<i>Hankius</i>

439
00:19:46,034 --> 00:19:49,703
<i>pankius.</i>

440
00:19:49,705 --> 00:19:52,305
I was afraid you'd be too tired.

441
00:19:52,307 --> 00:19:55,141
Amy, I just saw a magic train

442
00:19:55,143 --> 00:19:58,878
and reported somebody
for cutting the line.

443
00:20:00,048 --> 00:20:02,615
If that's not foreplay,
I don't know what is.

444
00:20:02,617 --> 00:20:03,883
(chuckles)
