1
00:00:03,511 --> 00:00:06,111
Aw, man, did you see
this post from Raj?

2
00:00:06,113 --> 00:00:08,580
What? Is it another
video of him and his dog

3
00:00:08,582 --> 00:00:11,917
Lady-and-the-Tramping
some spaghetti?

4
00:00:11,919 --> 00:00:14,186
No. He can't afford
his apartment,

5
00:00:14,188 --> 00:00:17,122
and he's asking if anyone knows
of a cheap place to live.

6
00:00:17,124 --> 00:00:20,559
I want to say "India,"
but it seems mean.

7
00:00:21,796 --> 00:00:23,228
(chuckling)

8
00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:24,730
What's so funny?

9
00:00:24,732 --> 00:00:27,166
Raj is looking for
a cheap place to live,

10
00:00:27,168 --> 00:00:29,668
and I wrote "India."

11
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:33,372
Don't post that;
be supportive.

12
00:00:33,374 --> 00:00:36,842
Maybe you should be supportive
of my hilarious jokes.

13
00:00:38,412 --> 00:00:40,646
Fine, what should we do?

14
00:00:40,648 --> 00:00:43,015
We're smart. I'm sure we
can think of something.

15
00:00:43,017 --> 00:00:44,550
You want to let him
live here?

16
00:00:44,552 --> 00:00:46,652
Oh, we're smarter
than that.

17
00:00:47,621 --> 00:00:49,922
I know our
apartment's small,

18
00:00:49,924 --> 00:00:51,890
but I think we
can make room.

19
00:00:51,892 --> 00:00:53,325
No, Sheldon.

20
00:00:53,327 --> 00:00:56,195
We are not getting
a life-size Spider-Man statue.

21
00:00:58,232 --> 00:01:00,866
We do have Sheldon's old room.

22
00:01:00,868 --> 00:01:02,334
If he really needs
a place to stay,

23
00:01:02,336 --> 00:01:03,936
I guess we should
offer it to him.

24
00:01:03,938 --> 00:01:05,237
You're a good friend.

25
00:01:05,239 --> 00:01:08,140
Am I still a good friend
if I wait and hope

26
00:01:08,142 --> 00:01:10,809
that Howard offers him
a place to live first?

27
00:01:10,811 --> 00:01:13,011
You're an even
better husband.

28
00:01:14,448 --> 00:01:16,715
I know if the roles
were reversed,

29
00:01:16,717 --> 00:01:18,617
he would do it for me.

30
00:01:18,619 --> 00:01:20,118
Where would he stay?

31
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:21,620
We already have Stuart.

32
00:01:21,622 --> 00:01:24,489
Well, we can make some space
in the garage.

33
00:01:24,491 --> 00:01:26,525
Maybe put a cot out there,

34
00:01:26,527 --> 00:01:28,827
get him a space heater,
maybe a hot plate.

35
00:01:28,829 --> 00:01:30,329
That sounds awful.

36
00:01:30,331 --> 00:01:33,232
Let's hope he thinks so, too.

37
00:01:33,234 --> 00:01:35,200
For the last time,

38
00:01:35,202 --> 00:01:39,404
no Hulk, no Batman,
no life-size statues.

39
00:01:39,406 --> 00:01:41,940
Wow. I'm starting to
think you didn't mean it

40
00:01:41,942 --> 00:01:44,610
when you said you wanted
to spruce up the place.

41
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:49,681
? Our whole universe
was in a hot, dense state ?

42
00:01:49,683 --> 00:01:53,252
? Then nearly 14 billion years
ago expansion started... Wait! ?

43
00:01:53,254 --> 00:01:54,786
? The Earth began to cool ?

44
00:01:54,788 --> 00:01:57,689
? The autotrophs began to drool,
Neanderthals developed tools ?

45
00:01:57,691 --> 00:01:59,892
? We built the Wall ?
? <i>We built the pyramids</i> ?

46
00:01:59,894 --> 00:02:02,561
? Math, Science, History,
unraveling the mystery ?

47
00:02:02,563 --> 00:02:04,396
? That all started
with a big bang ?

48
00:02:04,398 --> 00:02:04,978
? <i>Bang!</i> ?

51
00:02:15,381 --> 00:02:17,581
(ringtone playing)

52
00:02:18,684 --> 00:02:20,217
Hello.

53
00:02:20,219 --> 00:02:25,489
Hey, uh, so we've been talking,
and if you need a place to stay,

54
00:02:25,491 --> 00:02:28,325
we'd be happy to fix up
the garage for you.

55
00:02:28,327 --> 00:02:30,194
That would be amazing!

56
00:02:30,196 --> 00:02:32,463
I was literally just looking
at my moving boxes,

57
00:02:32,465 --> 00:02:35,199
trying to pick one to live in.

58
00:02:35,201 --> 00:02:37,034
I know it's not ideal,

59
00:02:37,036 --> 00:02:39,136
but you'd have plenty of space
for your furniture,

60
00:02:39,138 --> 00:02:40,638
and there's this cool button

61
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:43,841
that makes an entire wall
go up and down.

62
00:02:43,843 --> 00:02:46,076
I cannot thank you enough.

63
00:02:46,078 --> 00:02:48,078
It is our pleasure.
(line beeps)

64
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:49,914
Hey, can you hold on one sec?

65
00:02:49,916 --> 00:02:51,148
Hello?

66
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:53,784
Hey, buddy, you still
looking for a place to live?

67
00:02:53,786 --> 00:02:55,719
Uh... yeah.

68
00:02:55,721 --> 00:02:57,721
Why do you ask?

69
00:02:57,723 --> 00:02:59,423
You know, we have
the extra bedroom,

70
00:02:59,425 --> 00:03:01,058
and if you need it, it's yours.

71
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:03,594
Oh, my God, that's so generous!

72
00:03:03,596 --> 00:03:04,828
It's the least we can do.

73
00:03:04,830 --> 00:03:06,096
I-I really appreciate it.

74
00:03:06,098 --> 00:03:09,700
Uh, can you hold on one second?

75
00:03:09,702 --> 00:03:13,804
Hey, so, Howard, what's the
bathroom situation gonna be?

76
00:03:13,806 --> 00:03:16,740
Well, there's a sink out there--

77
00:03:16,742 --> 00:03:20,210
that takes care
of half your problems.

78
00:03:20,212 --> 00:03:22,446
But I can use
the downstairs bathroom, right?

79
00:03:22,448 --> 00:03:26,283
Yeah. We barely use it,
so it'll be like it's yours.

80
00:03:26,285 --> 00:03:27,384
Cool, cool, yeah.

81
00:03:27,386 --> 00:03:29,620
Yeah, hold on one second.
Wh...?

82
00:03:29,622 --> 00:03:32,690
Hey, what's it like
sharing a bathroom with Penny?

83
00:03:32,692 --> 00:03:34,425
Is there hair everywhere?

84
00:03:34,427 --> 00:03:37,461
Does she use your loofah?

85
00:03:37,463 --> 00:03:38,862
I don't have a loofah.

86
00:03:38,864 --> 00:03:40,397
Okay, well, if I move in,
you can't use mine.

87
00:03:40,399 --> 00:03:41,598
Hold on a second.

88
00:03:43,169 --> 00:03:47,404
Hey, Howard, uh,
how's the Wi-Fi in the garage?

89
00:03:47,406 --> 00:03:48,706
I don't know.

90
00:03:48,708 --> 00:03:50,841
Why are you asking
all these questions?

91
00:03:50,843 --> 00:03:53,010
Well, to be honest,
Leonard's on the other line,

92
00:03:53,012 --> 00:03:55,245
and he offered me
their spare bedroom.

93
00:03:55,247 --> 00:03:57,247
Great! Go live there.

94
00:03:57,249 --> 00:04:00,250
But you made the garage
sound so fun.

95
00:04:00,252 --> 00:04:02,353
I just didn't want you
to feel bad about it.

96
00:04:02,355 --> 00:04:04,121
Unless Leonard's apartment
also has a raccoon

97
00:04:04,123 --> 00:04:07,424
that chews its way in
on cold nights, go there!

98
00:04:07,426 --> 00:04:09,760
One second.
(clears throat)

99
00:04:09,762 --> 00:04:12,062
Okay, I think we're close.

100
00:04:12,064 --> 00:04:15,366
How do you feel about
a mini-fridge in my room?

101
00:04:15,368 --> 00:04:17,468
Hey, pal, you want
to live here or not?

102
00:04:17,470 --> 00:04:19,803
Oh, uh, hi, Penny. Yes, please.

103
00:04:21,941 --> 00:04:23,640
Hey.
Hi.

104
00:04:23,642 --> 00:04:26,276
Uh, Penny, this circular
is addressed to "occupant,"

105
00:04:26,278 --> 00:04:27,845
but with our
apartment switch,

106
00:04:27,847 --> 00:04:29,613
it's unclear whether
it's yours or mine.

107
00:04:29,615 --> 00:04:30,748
PENNY:
What's it for?

108
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:31,949
SHELDON:
Roofing.

109
00:04:31,951 --> 00:04:34,284
PENNY:
Yeah, it's yours.

110
00:04:34,286 --> 00:04:36,420
SHELDON:
Okay, thanks.

111
00:04:36,422 --> 00:04:38,455
"Just throw it out."

112
00:04:39,592 --> 00:04:42,493
Speaking of occupants,
I'm given to understand

113
00:04:42,495 --> 00:04:45,095
Raj will be moving
into my old room.

114
00:04:45,097 --> 00:04:46,397
Yeah, for a little while.

115
00:04:46,399 --> 00:04:47,831
What about his dog?

116
00:04:47,833 --> 00:04:49,967
She'll be in her crate;
it's not a big deal.

117
00:04:49,969 --> 00:04:51,368
I suppose that's
acceptable.

118
00:04:51,370 --> 00:04:53,170
Well, Sheldon's getting
a little better with dogs.

119
00:04:53,172 --> 00:04:57,174
He even took a picture
with Pluto at Disneyland.

120
00:04:57,176 --> 00:05:00,377
If real dogs gave me buttons,
I'd like them, too.

121
00:05:01,547 --> 00:05:03,414
Well, I think it's very nice

122
00:05:03,416 --> 00:05:05,315
that you're helping out
our friend.

123
00:05:05,317 --> 00:05:07,818
I think it's nice that you're
taking whatever medication

124
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:09,887
Amy's clearly giving you.

125
00:05:11,657 --> 00:05:13,090
And what is that
supposed to mean?

126
00:05:13,092 --> 00:05:14,425
PENNY: Well, it's like
that science thing.

127
00:05:14,427 --> 00:05:17,127
For every action,
you have a gigantic

128
00:05:17,129 --> 00:05:20,431
and annoying reaction.

129
00:05:20,433 --> 00:05:22,633
LEONARD: Just when I thought
you couldn't get any hotter.

130
00:05:22,635 --> 00:05:25,069
PENNY:
Mm-hmm.

131
00:05:25,071 --> 00:05:27,604
SHELDON: If you're implying
that I'd have some problem

132
00:05:27,606 --> 00:05:29,907
with him moving into my room,
you're wrong.

133
00:05:29,909 --> 00:05:32,609
Raj is in a difficult
financial situation,

134
00:05:32,611 --> 00:05:34,912
and I'm glad that he's
making changes to improve it.

135
00:05:34,914 --> 00:05:37,414
Do not adjust the dosage.
You nailed it.

136
00:05:40,653 --> 00:05:42,219
Don't listen to them.
(door closes)

137
00:05:42,221 --> 00:05:43,887
What's weird is
that Penny almost got

138
00:05:43,889 --> 00:05:46,990
a science fact right.

139
00:05:46,992 --> 00:05:49,293
I mean, it's unfair; people just
assume I'm going to be upset

140
00:05:49,295 --> 00:05:51,395
by Raj moving into my old room.

141
00:05:51,397 --> 00:05:53,263
But you are, aren't you?

142
00:05:53,265 --> 00:05:54,498
Oh, I'm outraged.

143
00:05:55,768 --> 00:05:58,035
Talk to me.
Tell me what's going on.

144
00:05:58,037 --> 00:06:01,672
Well, that's been my room
since before I met Leonard,

145
00:06:01,674 --> 00:06:02,973
and now someone else

146
00:06:02,975 --> 00:06:04,341
is going to be living in it.

147
00:06:04,343 --> 00:06:05,709
And that someone else is not me.

148
00:06:05,711 --> 00:06:08,078
And you know how I feel about
people who aren't me.

149
00:06:10,282 --> 00:06:12,983
There are a lot of memories
wrapped up in that room.

150
00:06:12,985 --> 00:06:14,284
For me, too.

151
00:06:14,286 --> 00:06:16,753
The first time you told me
you loved me was in that room.

152
00:06:16,755 --> 00:06:17,855
Wrong.

153
00:06:17,857 --> 00:06:20,624
We were standing outside
my room in the hallway.

154
00:06:20,626 --> 00:06:24,194
And there is the love
of which I speak.

155
00:06:24,196 --> 00:06:25,929
I realize it's irrational,

156
00:06:25,931 --> 00:06:29,233
but with Raj moving in there,
I'm feeling a bit replaced.

157
00:06:29,235 --> 00:06:32,202
Well, this isn't an
easy time for him.

158
00:06:32,204 --> 00:06:35,706
He's losing his
apartment, he's in debt,

159
00:06:35,708 --> 00:06:36,974
he's probably humiliated.

160
00:06:36,976 --> 00:06:38,942
Yes, probably.

161
00:06:38,944 --> 00:06:43,113
But until we know for sure,
how can I feel better?

162
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:46,583
Can I get anyone
anything at all?

163
00:06:46,585 --> 00:06:48,051
Raj, you don't
have to serve us.

164
00:06:48,053 --> 00:06:50,787
It's the least I can do for
helping me carry my stuff up.

165
00:06:50,789 --> 00:06:52,723
It was really no problem.

166
00:06:52,725 --> 00:06:55,492
Not for you,
Box of Towels.

167
00:06:57,062 --> 00:06:58,829
Anyway, thanks again.

168
00:06:58,831 --> 00:06:59,963
Hey, look at that.

169
00:06:59,965 --> 00:07:01,598
You've got a Raj,
we've got a Stuart.

170
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:03,600
Maybe we should take them
both to the park

171
00:07:03,602 --> 00:07:06,937
and let them
run around together.

172
00:07:06,939 --> 00:07:09,940
I don't know.
Yours looks like he has worms.

173
00:07:11,677 --> 00:07:12,910
You ready to go?

174
00:07:12,912 --> 00:07:14,144
All set.

175
00:07:14,146 --> 00:07:15,145
What's that?

176
00:07:15,147 --> 00:07:18,048
A housewarming gift for Raj.

177
00:07:18,050 --> 00:07:20,017
Well, a bunch of fake snakes
better not

178
00:07:20,019 --> 00:07:23,887
spring out of it, 'cause that
was a lousy anniversary present.

179
00:07:23,889 --> 00:07:25,722
It's nothing like that.

180
00:07:25,724 --> 00:07:27,291
I just, I thought
about Raj's situation,

181
00:07:27,293 --> 00:07:29,793
and I had a
change of heart.

182
00:07:29,795 --> 00:07:31,495
You know, and
regarding your gift,

183
00:07:31,497 --> 00:07:34,431
you said "surprise me,"
and, boy, did I.

184
00:07:37,002 --> 00:07:38,135
- Hello.
- Hey. - Hi.

185
00:07:38,137 --> 00:07:39,636
Perfect timing.
Food's ready.

186
00:07:39,638 --> 00:07:41,638
Uh, wait-- before we eat,
I have a little

187
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:43,807
"welcome to the building"
gift for Raj.

188
00:07:43,809 --> 00:07:45,242
Wait, is anything
gonna jump out...

189
00:07:45,244 --> 00:07:46,476
No. I already asked.

190
00:07:47,947 --> 00:07:50,547
Thank you, Sheldon.

191
00:07:50,549 --> 00:07:52,849
It's a...
blank notebook.

192
00:07:52,851 --> 00:07:55,419
Well, I had some of
my best ideas in that room,

193
00:07:55,421 --> 00:07:57,321
and I'm sure you will, too.

194
00:07:57,323 --> 00:07:58,889
He also never
had sex in that room.

195
00:07:58,891 --> 00:08:00,724
That's something else
to look forward to.

196
00:08:03,229 --> 00:08:04,561
This means a lot.

197
00:08:04,563 --> 00:08:06,863
Well, I know this is
a difficult time for you.

198
00:08:06,865 --> 00:08:09,499
Y-You're losing your apartment,
you're in debt,

199
00:08:09,501 --> 00:08:11,368
and you just--
you must be humiliated.

200
00:08:11,370 --> 00:08:12,169
Sheldon...

201
00:08:12,171 --> 00:08:13,604
Oh, good grief.

202
00:08:13,606 --> 00:08:15,706
She is such a stickler
for citing sources.

203
00:08:15,708 --> 00:08:17,574
Those were Amy's words.

204
00:08:17,576 --> 00:08:19,610
Sheldon...

205
00:08:19,612 --> 00:08:20,844
I know, I know!

206
00:08:20,846 --> 00:08:23,513
"Good grief" was originally said
by Charlie Brown, geez.

207
00:08:24,683 --> 00:08:26,650
You're right,
I am humiliated.

208
00:08:26,652 --> 00:08:28,118
Thanks for
pointing it out.

209
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:29,720
You're such a jerk.

210
00:08:30,289 --> 00:08:31,622
Can you believe this guy?

211
00:08:31,624 --> 00:08:34,157
ALL:
Yes.

212
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:37,127
I-I thought that was
gonna break the other way.

213
00:08:37,129 --> 00:08:38,362
AMY:
Come on, Sheldon.

214
00:08:38,364 --> 00:08:39,863
Maybe we should just
eat at our place.

215
00:08:39,865 --> 00:08:40,865
Fine.

216
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:42,766
You took my room.

217
00:08:42,768 --> 00:08:44,434
You turned my friends
against me.

218
00:08:44,436 --> 00:08:45,535
I hope you're happy.

219
00:08:45,537 --> 00:08:46,970
What do I have
to be happy about?

220
00:08:46,972 --> 00:08:47,971
My life's a wreck.

221
00:08:47,973 --> 00:08:49,906
How come he can say it
and I can't?

222
00:08:49,908 --> 00:08:51,875
Just keep walking.

223
00:08:59,602 --> 00:09:01,402
(Skype ringing)

224
00:09:01,404 --> 00:09:02,703
BEVERLY:
Hello, Sheldon.

225
00:09:02,705 --> 00:09:04,571
What a pleasant surprise.

226
00:09:04,573 --> 00:09:06,040
How are you?

227
00:09:06,042 --> 00:09:08,275
Honestly, I've been better.

228
00:09:08,277 --> 00:09:09,710
Do you have time?

229
00:09:09,712 --> 00:09:11,946
Leonard says you're very busy
these days.

230
00:09:11,948 --> 00:09:14,515
Oh, I just say that
because he prattles.

231
00:09:15,785 --> 00:09:17,484
What's going on?

232
00:09:17,486 --> 00:09:21,555
Well, our friend Raj
moved into my old room,

233
00:09:21,557 --> 00:09:25,159
and it's brought up a lot of
negative feelings for me.

234
00:09:25,161 --> 00:09:29,096
Mm. Well, what do you think the
loss of your room represents?

235
00:09:29,098 --> 00:09:31,332
Beverly, you know I
hold you in high esteem.

236
00:09:31,334 --> 00:09:34,601
Can we skip the part where you
pretend not to know the answer,

237
00:09:34,603 --> 00:09:37,104
and get to the part
where you tell me the answer?

238
00:09:37,106 --> 00:09:39,907
Very well, but, uh,
if you don't mind,

239
00:09:39,909 --> 00:09:41,976
I'd still like to pause
for effect.

240
00:09:41,978 --> 00:09:43,310
(clears throat)

241
00:09:43,312 --> 00:09:45,279
Now...

242
00:09:46,916 --> 00:09:50,317
You've recently moved in
with Dr. Fowler, yes?

243
00:09:50,319 --> 00:09:52,386
I have.

244
00:09:52,388 --> 00:09:55,522
Clearly, your old room
represents an escape hatch,

245
00:09:55,524 --> 00:09:57,591
and without it,
you're forced to confront

246
00:09:57,593 --> 00:09:59,827
the terrifying reality
of being trapped

247
00:09:59,829 --> 00:10:02,963
in a relationship
with Amy forever.

248
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:05,766
I hadn't thought about that.

249
00:10:05,768 --> 00:10:08,402
And don't start
thinking about it now!

250
00:10:08,404 --> 00:10:11,372
Hello, Amy.

251
00:10:11,374 --> 00:10:14,341
Your defensiveness may indicate
similar insecurities

252
00:10:14,343 --> 00:10:16,910
about your relationship
with Sheldon.

253
00:10:16,912 --> 00:10:17,911
That's not true!

254
00:10:17,913 --> 00:10:20,748
She said defensively.

255
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:23,784
This isn't about
me and Sheldon.

256
00:10:23,786 --> 00:10:27,054
This is about Rajesh moving in
with Leonard and Penny.

257
00:10:27,056 --> 00:10:29,223
Interesting.

258
00:10:29,225 --> 00:10:32,993
They've found a need
to take yet another roommate.

259
00:10:32,995 --> 00:10:36,697
Seems they're avoiding
some harsh realities themselves.

260
00:10:36,699 --> 00:10:38,632
I had no idea

261
00:10:38,634 --> 00:10:41,101
all our relationships
were such a disaster.

262
00:10:41,103 --> 00:10:42,736
Boy, you're good.

263
00:10:42,738 --> 00:10:45,105
That is the word
on the street, dear.

264
00:10:47,910 --> 00:10:50,744
Maybe moving in
was a bad idea.

265
00:10:50,746 --> 00:10:53,147
I haven't been here one day,
I'm already causing problems.

266
00:10:53,149 --> 00:10:55,182
You didn't do anything.
It's Sheldon.

267
00:10:55,184 --> 00:10:56,884
"You didn't do anything.
It's Sheldon."

268
00:10:56,886 --> 00:10:59,887
That'd make a nice
needlepoint pillow.

269
00:11:00,756 --> 00:11:02,956
So, relax.
We're happy to have you.

270
00:11:02,958 --> 00:11:04,358
Thank you, but how do I know

271
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:05,893
you're not saying that
just to be nice?

272
00:11:05,895 --> 00:11:07,661
Do you actually pay
for that haircut?

273
00:11:07,663 --> 00:11:09,063
That'll do it.

274
00:11:10,866 --> 00:11:13,567
Hey, Raj,
I owe you an apology.

275
00:11:13,569 --> 00:11:16,470
Look, could you please
put your dog on a leash?

276
00:11:16,472 --> 00:11:18,472
Sheldon, she's fine.

277
00:11:18,474 --> 00:11:20,107
Well, then at least
hold her still

278
00:11:20,109 --> 00:11:21,542
so I can pretend she's stuffed.

279
00:11:22,411 --> 00:11:26,046
Raj, I let my emotions
get the best of me,

280
00:11:26,048 --> 00:11:28,248
and I unfairly
took it out on you.

281
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:30,117
Thank you. I appreciate that.

282
00:11:30,119 --> 00:11:31,652
No, I can't take all the credit.

283
00:11:31,654 --> 00:11:34,288
I spoke with Leonard's mother,
and she made me feel better.

284
00:11:34,290 --> 00:11:38,158
I don't know who you talked to,
but that wasn't my mother.

285
00:11:39,995 --> 00:11:43,230
Beverly pointed out that
I'm experiencing insecurities

286
00:11:43,232 --> 00:11:44,898
in my relationship with Amy,

287
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:47,935
in the same way that Leonard and
Penny are in their relationship.

288
00:11:47,937 --> 00:11:51,305
What are you talking about?
We're fine.

289
00:11:51,307 --> 00:11:53,674
Yes, you're fine
as long as you have a buffer

290
00:11:53,676 --> 00:11:56,043
living with you to distract
from your marital problems.

291
00:11:56,045 --> 00:11:57,678
It used to be me.

292
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:00,447
Now it's Raj
and his attack Tribble.

293
00:12:01,617 --> 00:12:04,618
Anyway, I'm sorry
for everything.

294
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:07,121
Oh, and FYI-- if you cry
while they're fighting,

295
00:12:07,123 --> 00:12:08,589
they'll take you to McDonald's.

296
00:12:13,562 --> 00:12:15,829
(Skype ringing)

297
00:12:15,831 --> 00:12:17,097
Hello, Leonard.

298
00:12:17,099 --> 00:12:19,800
Why are you saying
we have marital problems?

299
00:12:19,802 --> 00:12:21,568
We don't have marital problems!

300
00:12:21,570 --> 00:12:25,472
I see. You must be yelling at me
out of wedded bliss.

301
00:12:28,577 --> 00:12:31,378
Look, just because we took
our friend in does not mean

302
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:33,480
that Penny and I are
afraid to be alone.

303
00:12:33,482 --> 00:12:36,583
Yeah, this is a
special circumstance.

304
00:12:36,585 --> 00:12:38,485
Sheldon mentioned
you tried to get your brother

305
00:12:38,487 --> 00:12:39,853
to live with you, as well.

306
00:12:39,855 --> 00:12:42,823
Yeah, well, a circumstance
can happen twice

307
00:12:42,825 --> 00:12:45,492
and still be special.

308
00:12:45,494 --> 00:12:46,927
Do you agree with that?

309
00:12:46,929 --> 00:12:49,329
Well, now that
you point it out...

310
00:12:49,331 --> 00:12:51,131
Are you kidding me?

311
00:12:51,133 --> 00:12:53,534
We do seem to keep
finding roommates.

312
00:12:53,536 --> 00:12:55,569
Now you're
taking her side?

313
00:12:55,571 --> 00:12:58,505
Dear, I would never come
between you and Leonard.

314
00:12:58,507 --> 00:13:02,075
That's for your parade
of roommates to do.

315
00:13:04,647 --> 00:13:08,382
KOOTHRAPPALI (whispering):
Howard?

316
00:13:08,384 --> 00:13:09,750
Howard!

317
00:13:09,752 --> 00:13:11,919
(Howard and Bernadette scream)

318
00:13:11,921 --> 00:13:13,854
It's me!
It's just me!

319
00:13:13,856 --> 00:13:16,223
What are you doing here?!

320
00:13:16,225 --> 00:13:18,659
Well, I texted you,
but you didn't respond.

321
00:13:18,661 --> 00:13:20,294
Leonard and Penny
were arguing...

322
00:13:20,296 --> 00:13:22,095
Not on my watch!

323
00:13:24,667 --> 00:13:26,500
It's fine.
It's just Raj.

324
00:13:26,502 --> 00:13:28,902
You can hit him with
the bat, but it's fine.

325
00:13:29,972 --> 00:13:32,906
And if my heart stops,
just let me go.

326
00:13:32,908 --> 00:13:34,308
I'm sorry, guys.

327
00:13:34,310 --> 00:13:37,077
Sheldon was upset,
Leonard and Penny were fighting.

328
00:13:37,079 --> 00:13:40,147
I just wanted to go someplace
where I wasn't causing problems.

329
00:13:40,149 --> 00:13:41,949
(sighs) I'll say it again.

330
00:13:41,951 --> 00:13:44,151
India.

331
00:13:46,755 --> 00:13:49,556
Can I just stay in the garage?

332
00:13:49,558 --> 00:13:51,525
Don't do that. We'll make
up the couch for you

333
00:13:51,527 --> 00:13:52,926
and figure out something
in the morning.

334
00:13:52,928 --> 00:13:54,027
Thank you.

335
00:13:54,029 --> 00:13:55,462
Come on,
I'll get you some sheets.

336
00:13:55,464 --> 00:13:57,631
Then we'll see
if I can beat my high score

337
00:13:57,633 --> 00:13:59,066
on the blood pressure machine.

338
00:14:03,138 --> 00:14:06,406
Never should've had all
these kids so close together.

339

340
00:14:17,686 --> 00:14:19,353
You okay?

341
00:14:19,355 --> 00:14:21,722
I can't sleep.

342
00:14:21,724 --> 00:14:24,124
What's wrong?

343
00:14:24,126 --> 00:14:26,093
Beverly believes

344
00:14:26,095 --> 00:14:30,163
I unconsciously consider
my old room an escape hatch.

345
00:14:30,165 --> 00:14:32,432
Is that bothering you?

346
00:14:32,434 --> 00:14:35,702
Yes. I don't care for
unconscious thoughts.

347
00:14:35,704 --> 00:14:37,371
My brain and I
are best friends.

348
00:14:37,373 --> 00:14:39,773
It should tell
me everything.

349
00:14:39,775 --> 00:14:42,909
I mean, how it relates
to our relationship,

350
00:14:42,911 --> 00:14:46,346
not the bromance
between you and your brain.

351
00:14:46,348 --> 00:14:49,283
What if she's correct?

352
00:14:49,285 --> 00:14:51,852
Doesn't that say something
troubling about us?

353
00:14:51,854 --> 00:14:53,587
I don't know.

354
00:14:53,589 --> 00:14:55,789
I just think
you're the kind of person

355
00:14:55,791 --> 00:14:58,191
who likes a contingency plan.

356
00:14:58,193 --> 00:15:00,761
That is true.

357
00:15:00,763 --> 00:15:02,929
Did you know
I figured out

358
00:15:02,931 --> 00:15:05,198
in which order I would
eat all my friends

359
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:07,567
in the event of
an apocalypse?

360
00:15:09,405 --> 00:15:12,506
You need to stop hanging out
with your brain so much.

361
00:15:12,508 --> 00:15:14,174
It's not a good influence.

362
00:15:18,247 --> 00:15:19,613
If you're looking
for spare change,

363
00:15:19,615 --> 00:15:21,381
I already cleaned it out.

364
00:15:23,485 --> 00:15:25,552
Well...
(clears throat)

365
00:15:25,554 --> 00:15:28,055
Didn't think this is
where my life would be.

366
00:15:28,057 --> 00:15:30,924
Me, either. I'm in a bedroom
and you're on a couch.

367
00:15:30,926 --> 00:15:33,960
I'm actually winning.

368
00:15:33,962 --> 00:15:35,462
You know, we're both
down on our luck.

369
00:15:35,464 --> 00:15:37,564
Maybe you and I should try
to get a place together.

370
00:15:37,566 --> 00:15:39,833
(chuckles):
Okay, listen to me.

371
00:15:43,505 --> 00:15:46,173
There is no reason
to leave here.

372
00:15:46,175 --> 00:15:48,108
This is great.
Everyone's nice.

373
00:15:48,110 --> 00:15:49,476
It's comfortable.

374
00:15:49,478 --> 00:15:53,213
If all goes according to plan,
this is my retirement home.

375
00:15:53,215 --> 00:15:54,815
Wouldn't you feel better
about yourself

376
00:15:54,817 --> 00:15:55,949
if you were more independent?

377
00:15:55,951 --> 00:15:58,051
Better than I feel
in their steam shower?

378
00:15:58,053 --> 00:16:00,220
I don't think so.

379
00:16:00,989 --> 00:16:04,024
Penny would be
the entree.

380
00:16:06,495 --> 00:16:09,763
Then Leonard's basically
a cheese course.

381
00:16:09,765 --> 00:16:13,367
And because I love
you, you're dessert.

382
00:16:13,369 --> 00:16:16,236
I want to say "aw,"

383
00:16:16,238 --> 00:16:18,438
but I'm gonna say "ew."

384
00:16:19,608 --> 00:16:21,708
No, you see,
I'm doing this

385
00:16:21,710 --> 00:16:24,177
so I can stop being
spoiled and, you know,

386
00:16:24,179 --> 00:16:26,580
grow as a person.

387
00:16:26,582 --> 00:16:28,115
Good for you.

388
00:16:28,117 --> 00:16:31,084
This sandwich has six dollars
worth of ham in it.

389
00:16:33,922 --> 00:16:37,491
Don't you even feel a little
bad sponging off your friends?

390
00:16:37,493 --> 00:16:40,060
Hey, look,
I went to art college,

391
00:16:40,062 --> 00:16:42,329
I tried to make it
as a graphic artist,

392
00:16:42,331 --> 00:16:43,897
a comic book artist,

393
00:16:43,899 --> 00:16:45,899
and you know what I got
for my efforts?

394
00:16:45,901 --> 00:16:47,601
A visible rib cage.

395
00:16:47,603 --> 00:16:49,903
I'm not kidding.

396
00:16:49,905 --> 00:16:52,305
You could see my heart beating.

397
00:16:52,307 --> 00:16:54,741
Well, no offense, but
I didn't go to art school.

398
00:16:54,743 --> 00:16:56,910
I have a PhD in
astrophysics.

399
00:16:56,912 --> 00:16:59,546
Oh, great, it'll be easier
for you to look up at the stars

400
00:16:59,548 --> 00:17:01,715
without a roof over your head.

401
00:17:04,420 --> 00:17:05,752
Morning.

402
00:17:05,754 --> 00:17:07,654
Did you know
Raj moved out last night?

403
00:17:07,656 --> 00:17:09,456
What? Why?

404
00:17:09,458 --> 00:17:12,058
"Leonard and Penny, I'm sorry
for all the trouble I've caused.

405
00:17:12,060 --> 00:17:13,527
"I went to stay at Howard's.

406
00:17:13,529 --> 00:17:15,395
"P.S., Cinnamon's with me,

407
00:17:15,397 --> 00:17:17,230
"but if you feel like
messing with Sheldon,

408
00:17:17,232 --> 00:17:19,833
tell him she's loose
in the building."

409
00:17:22,037 --> 00:17:23,703
I feel terrible.

410
00:17:23,705 --> 00:17:25,005
Should we go bring him back?

411
00:17:25,007 --> 00:17:26,239
Well, you're
the one worried

412
00:17:26,241 --> 00:17:28,508
having someone live with us
is a sign of problems.

413
00:17:28,510 --> 00:17:31,711
Oh, that was just because
my mother got in my head.

414
00:17:31,713 --> 00:17:35,015
It's like being possessed,
but instead of Satan, it's--

415
00:17:35,017 --> 00:17:37,451
Actually, it's the same thing.

416
00:17:38,454 --> 00:17:40,854
All right, so we'll
ask him to come back.

417
00:17:40,856 --> 00:17:42,956
Well, great.

418
00:17:42,958 --> 00:17:44,858
Don't you want
to get dressed first?

419
00:17:44,860 --> 00:17:46,460
Just one second.

420
00:17:52,201 --> 00:17:55,035
Help! Cinnamon's loose
in the building!

421
00:17:56,271 --> 00:17:58,472
SHELDON:
Amy, quick, lock the door!

422
00:18:02,678 --> 00:18:05,011
We're so sorry if we made you
feel uncomfortable.

423
00:18:05,013 --> 00:18:06,680
We really weren't
fighting about you.

424
00:18:06,682 --> 00:18:09,015
I just never want to be
a burden on my friends.

425
00:18:09,017 --> 00:18:10,951
Me, either.
Don't want to be a burden.

426
00:18:10,953 --> 00:18:13,220
Hey, is that the baby?
I'll go check.

427
00:18:13,222 --> 00:18:14,821
You are not a burden,

428
00:18:14,823 --> 00:18:17,624
and we want you to come
back and stay with us.

429
00:18:17,626 --> 00:18:19,025
But I also upset Sheldon,

430
00:18:19,027 --> 00:18:21,461
and he's not gonna want
to come over if I'm there.

431
00:18:21,463 --> 00:18:24,064
More reasons
for you to stay.

432
00:18:25,367 --> 00:18:27,300
Halley's fine.

433
00:18:27,302 --> 00:18:30,203
You know she's at
my parents' house, right?

434
00:18:32,007 --> 00:18:35,008
And she's having
the time of her life.

435
00:18:35,911 --> 00:18:38,378
If you ever want
to change things up,

436
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:40,280
you're always
welcome here.

437
00:18:40,282 --> 00:18:43,717
Just not in our bedroom,
you dumbass.

438
00:18:45,721 --> 00:18:48,355
I appreciate it, but I think

439
00:18:48,357 --> 00:18:51,258
staying with Leonard and Penny
makes more sense for everyone.

440
00:18:51,260 --> 00:18:53,126
Then it's settled.
And just so you know,

441
00:18:53,128 --> 00:18:54,160
it's only temporary.

442
00:18:54,162 --> 00:18:55,795
I'm not gonna get
too comfortable.

443
00:18:55,797 --> 00:18:57,030
Good.

444
00:18:57,032 --> 00:18:59,866
Nobody needs a mooch living
in their house forever.

445
00:18:59,868 --> 00:19:02,569
Hey, that's no way
to talk about your baby.

446
00:19:13,545 --> 00:19:16,079
You know what?
I'm proud of us.

447
00:19:16,081 --> 00:19:18,615
Yeah, with Penny and
Leonard taking in Raj,

448
00:19:18,617 --> 00:19:20,784
and Stuart living with
Howard and Bernadette,

449
00:19:20,786 --> 00:19:22,919
we're the only couple
of our social group

450
00:19:22,921 --> 00:19:24,754
who doesn't need
to fill the holes

451
00:19:24,756 --> 00:19:27,257
in their relationship
with a third party.

452
00:19:27,259 --> 00:19:28,825
Yup, we're killin' it.
