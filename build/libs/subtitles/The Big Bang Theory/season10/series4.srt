1
00:00:02,872 --> 00:00:04,529
There was water everywhere.

2
00:00:04,530 --> 00:00:05,897
It was such a mess.

3
00:00:05,965 --> 00:00:07,918
That stinks. How long are you
out of the apartment?

4
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:08,919
About five weeks.

5
00:00:08,987 --> 00:00:10,231
Ugh! Did you lose
anything valuable?

6
00:00:10,255 --> 00:00:11,722
Well, the pipe was
over my closet,

7
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:13,190
so all my
clothes are gone.

8
00:00:13,258 --> 00:00:15,693
Oh, so nothing. Great.

9
00:00:16,464 --> 00:00:18,169
Do they know why
the pipe burst?

10
00:00:18,235 --> 00:00:19,435
They didn't say.

11
00:00:19,503 --> 00:00:20,937
Buildings
that have a combination

12
00:00:21,004 --> 00:00:22,205
of copper and galvanized steel

13
00:00:22,272 --> 00:00:24,936
are susceptible to
pinholes and corrosion

14
00:00:25,036 --> 00:00:27,371
caused by the mobility
of ions in the water.

15
00:00:31,267 --> 00:00:34,136
Can't have your head shoved
in a toilet as much as I did

16
00:00:34,137 --> 00:00:37,940
and not pick up a few things
about plumbing.

17
00:00:38,008 --> 00:00:41,210
Well, if you need a place to
crash, you can stay with us.

18
00:00:41,278 --> 00:00:42,745
- Really?
- Of course.

19
00:00:42,813 --> 00:00:45,681
You can stay in Leonard's room,
and we'll stay at my place.

20
00:00:45,749 --> 00:00:47,349
You're sure
that's not an inconvenience?

21
00:00:47,417 --> 00:00:48,684
No, not at all.

22
00:00:48,752 --> 00:00:50,052
And we live with Sheldon,

23
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:52,421
so the word "inconvenience"
has really lost all meaning.

24
00:00:53,857 --> 00:00:57,393
So, technically, I'd be
moving in with my boyfriend?

25
00:00:57,461 --> 00:00:58,928
I guess so.

26
00:00:58,995 --> 00:01:01,444
I'd finally get to live
alone with my husband.

27
00:01:01,921 --> 00:01:04,083
Oh, my, this is
a big step.

28
00:01:04,084 --> 00:01:04,831
Mm-hmm.

29
00:01:04,832 --> 00:01:06,833
For two of us, it's in
the right direction.

30
00:01:12,005 --> 00:01:15,874
Why are you all smiling
like crazy people?

31
00:01:15,942 --> 00:01:19,378
? Our whole universe
was in a hot, dense state ?

32
00:01:19,445 --> 00:01:22,781
? Then nearly 14 billion years
ago expansion started... Wait! ?

33
00:01:22,849 --> 00:01:24,349
? The Earth began to cool

34
00:01:24,417 --> 00:01:26,897
? The autotrophs began to drool,
Neanderthals developed tools ?

35
00:01:26,953 --> 00:01:29,588
? We built the Wall
? <i>We built the pyramids</i> ?

36
00:01:29,656 --> 00:01:32,224
? Math, Science, History,
unraveling the mystery ?

37
00:01:32,292 --> 00:01:34,192
? That all started
with a big bang ?

38
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:34,684
? <i>Bang!</i> ?

Cohabitation
with my girlfriend?

42
00:01:47,324 --> 00:01:49,057
That's a great deal
to process.

43
00:01:49,081 --> 00:01:49,525
Mm.

44
00:01:49,526 --> 00:01:50,860
It's only for five weeks.

45
00:01:50,927 --> 00:01:52,862
Yeah, and we'll be
right across the hall.

46
00:01:52,929 --> 00:01:54,130
What do you think?

47
00:01:54,197 --> 00:01:55,631
I don't know.

48
00:01:55,699 --> 00:01:59,135
What if living together
kills the romance?

49
00:02:00,737 --> 00:02:03,472
Okay, you guys had sex
one whole time.

50
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:05,841
Nothing can put out
a fire like that.

51
00:02:05,909 --> 00:02:08,077
Yeah, but what happens

52
00:02:08,145 --> 00:02:10,246
when we each get a peek
behind the curtain?

53
00:02:10,313 --> 00:02:13,082
I mean, she's never even
seen me unshaven.

54
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:14,950
You just shaved yesterday.

55
00:02:15,018 --> 00:02:16,452
You're good for three months.

56
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:19,121
Sheldon, I understand
your apprehension,

57
00:02:19,189 --> 00:02:21,290
but let me appeal
to the scientist in you.

58
00:02:21,358 --> 00:02:23,359
Given the five-week end date,

59
00:02:23,427 --> 00:02:26,395
isn't it the perfect opportunity
to consider this an experiment

60
00:02:26,463 --> 00:02:28,431
and collect data
on our compatibility?

61
00:02:28,498 --> 00:02:31,734
Don't try luring me in
with sexy talk.

62
00:02:31,802 --> 00:02:33,202
Okay.

63
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:34,703
<i>The Original Series.</i>

64
00:02:34,771 --> 00:02:36,372
The <i>Enterprise</i> was
on a five-year mission

65
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:37,573
to explore new worlds.

66
00:02:37,641 --> 00:02:38,741
Think of this
as your

67
00:02:38,809 --> 00:02:41,110
personal five-week mission
to do the same.

68
00:02:41,178 --> 00:02:45,448
If you want to lure me in with
sexy talk, that's how you do it.

69
00:02:46,917 --> 00:02:49,118
Don't be proud of that.

70
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:52,121
So, is that a yes?

71
00:02:52,189 --> 00:02:53,456
Not yet. I...

72
00:02:53,523 --> 00:02:56,559
How will I learn if
I'm comfortable living with Amy

73
00:02:56,626 --> 00:02:58,794
or just comfortable because
I'm in my own apartment?

74
00:02:58,862 --> 00:03:01,197
Now, if this experiment
is going to be valid,

75
00:03:01,264 --> 00:03:03,065
I suggest a neutral environment.

76
00:03:03,133 --> 00:03:04,400
Well, where would you go?

77
00:03:04,468 --> 00:03:05,768
Well, ideally, an enclosed,

78
00:03:05,836 --> 00:03:09,738
self-sustaining biodome
in New Mexico.

79
00:03:09,806 --> 00:03:14,143
Where we would eat crops
fertilized with our own waste.

80
00:03:14,211 --> 00:03:17,379
And you were worried
about the romance.

81
00:03:17,447 --> 00:03:18,914
Wait.

82
00:03:18,982 --> 00:03:21,917
Why don't you guys stay across
the hall, and we will live here?

83
00:03:21,985 --> 00:03:23,652
Interesting.

84
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:26,121
If my official residence
were across the hall,

85
00:03:26,189 --> 00:03:30,359
I wonder if I'd need to knock
every time I came over here.

86
00:03:30,427 --> 00:03:32,027
That's a good question.

87
00:03:32,095 --> 00:03:34,163
Maybe just don't come over.

88
00:03:36,399 --> 00:03:39,235
Historically, I don't
do well with change.

89
00:03:39,302 --> 00:03:40,536
Okay, it won't
be that bad.

90
00:03:40,604 --> 00:03:42,114
We wouldn't even sit in
your spot while you're gone.

91
00:03:42,138 --> 00:03:43,706
You're darn right, you wouldn't.

92
00:03:43,773 --> 00:03:46,108
No matter where I am,
this will always be my spot.

93
00:03:46,176 --> 00:03:47,243
Like an embassy

94
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:48,511
in a foreign country,

95
00:03:48,578 --> 00:03:51,647
this seat is the sovereign
soil of my bottom.

96
00:03:51,715 --> 00:03:54,717
Just nod and smile.
He's almost gone.

97
00:03:56,386 --> 00:03:58,821
Sheldon, what do you think?

98
00:04:01,458 --> 00:04:02,992
Very well. I'm on board.

99
00:04:03,059 --> 00:04:04,426
- Seriously?
- Yes.

100
00:04:04,494 --> 00:04:05,861
I accept this
five-week mission

101
00:04:05,929 --> 00:04:07,997
to share a living space
with my girlfriend.

102
00:04:08,064 --> 00:04:09,465
Oh. This is so exciting.

103
00:04:09,533 --> 00:04:11,700
Well, now, don't be surprised
if, like <i>Star Trek,</i>

104
00:04:11,768 --> 00:04:14,603
it's canceled in three.

105
00:04:15,772 --> 00:04:19,441
I have to say, I am happy
with your ob-gyn.

106
00:04:20,777 --> 00:04:23,879
Cool. 'Cause she says
you're doing a great job as

107
00:04:23,947 --> 00:04:27,016
"weird friend who doesn't have
to be at every appointment."

108
00:04:27,083 --> 00:04:29,518
I'm the son of a gynecologist.
I could be helpful.

109
00:04:29,586 --> 00:04:30,819
It would help

110
00:04:30,887 --> 00:04:34,623
if you stopped telling me
I have a textbook cervix.

111
00:04:34,691 --> 00:04:37,693
The polite response is,
"Thank you for noticing."

112
00:04:40,931 --> 00:04:43,132
Let me see the sonogram again.

113
00:04:44,534 --> 00:04:47,536
Oh, yeah, that's a good-looking
baby for a little gray blob.

114
00:04:47,604 --> 00:04:50,272
Yeah, we could
name him Blobert.

115
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:51,941
What if it's a girl?

116
00:04:52,008 --> 00:04:53,742
Bloberta.

117
00:04:55,045 --> 00:04:56,478
Or Blobbi with an "I."

118
00:04:56,546 --> 00:05:00,115
Are we being silly
not finding out the sex?

119
00:05:00,183 --> 00:05:02,618
Yeah, I was just
thinking the same thing.

120
00:05:02,686 --> 00:05:04,553
If you want,
you can find out right now.

121
00:05:04,621 --> 00:05:05,955
- Mm.
- Hmm.

122
00:05:06,022 --> 00:05:08,062
The doctor's gone for the
day, so it doesn't matter.

123
00:05:08,091 --> 00:05:09,224
Well, somebody else knows

124
00:05:09,292 --> 00:05:10,993
because they saw it
in the folder.

125
00:05:11,061 --> 00:05:13,028
You looked in
our folder?!

126
00:05:13,096 --> 00:05:14,163
It was an accident.

127
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:16,231
The doctor left
the folder out on her desk.

128
00:05:16,299 --> 00:05:19,435
It's not my fault
I opened it and looked.

129
00:05:19,502 --> 00:05:23,138
So you know the sex
of our baby, and we don't?!

130
00:05:23,206 --> 00:05:26,141
Flip a coin.
You got a fifty-fifty shot.

131
00:05:26,209 --> 00:05:28,143
It's unbelievable.

132
00:05:28,211 --> 00:05:29,478
- God, Raj.
- What?

133
00:05:29,546 --> 00:05:30,980
This is not a problem, okay?

134
00:05:31,047 --> 00:05:33,182
If you don't want to know,
I don't have to tell you.

135
00:05:33,249 --> 00:05:35,217
We don't want <i>you</i> to know!

136
00:05:35,285 --> 00:05:37,753
Okay, well, that's a problem.

137
00:05:40,457 --> 00:05:43,692
You know, I'm very proud of you
for trying to live with Amy.

138
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:44,927
- Oh. Thank you.
- Mm.

139
00:05:44,995 --> 00:05:47,062
Of course, the ideal way
to conduct this experiment

140
00:05:47,130 --> 00:05:50,532
would be with four pairs of
identical Sheldons and Amys.

141
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:53,235
One pair that was neither
dating nor living together.

142
00:05:53,303 --> 00:05:55,437
One pair that was dating
but not living together.

143
00:05:55,505 --> 00:05:57,149
One pair that was living
together but not dating.

144
00:05:57,173 --> 00:05:58,293
And then, of
course, one pair

145
00:05:58,341 --> 00:06:00,242
that was living
together and dating.

146
00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:01,644
Although, with
that many Sheldons,

147
00:06:01,711 --> 00:06:04,279
it'd be such a party,
we'd never get anything done.

148
00:06:04,347 --> 00:06:06,682
That was a cute story.

149
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:08,550
So, um...

150
00:06:10,186 --> 00:06:11,487
What did you want to ask me?

151
00:06:11,554 --> 00:06:14,723
Well, you've lived with your
significant other for some time.

152
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:16,759
I would like this
experiment to go well.

153
00:06:16,826 --> 00:06:19,495
Are there any insights
you can share?

154
00:06:19,562 --> 00:06:22,965
Mm. Well, the biggie is,
if she has an insane roommate,

155
00:06:23,033 --> 00:06:24,833
kick him out
as soon as possible.

156
00:06:24,901 --> 00:06:27,803
You know, Leonard
and I were very happy

157
00:06:27,871 --> 00:06:29,605
before you came along.

158
00:06:31,207 --> 00:06:33,042
You've been roommates
with Sheldon forever.

159
00:06:33,109 --> 00:06:35,177
Do you have any advice?

160
00:06:35,245 --> 00:06:37,379
I'm trying to think of an answer

161
00:06:37,447 --> 00:06:39,615
that won't stop you
from doing this.

162
00:06:41,084 --> 00:06:42,384
I know it sounds
like a clich?,

163
00:06:42,452 --> 00:06:43,619
but compromise is key.

164
00:06:43,687 --> 00:06:45,421
Never leave a belt
on the floor.

165
00:06:45,488 --> 00:06:48,323
At night, they
look like snakes.

166
00:06:48,391 --> 00:06:50,893
Do little things, like bring her
a cup of coffee in bed.

167
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,394
Keep M&M'S in your pocket

168
00:06:52,462 --> 00:06:54,463
in case you have to
wait in a long line.

169
00:06:55,732 --> 00:06:57,566
You're gonna be seeing
each other a lot,

170
00:06:57,634 --> 00:06:59,702
so respect each other's
personal space.

171
00:06:59,769 --> 00:07:04,373
He startles easily, so,
please, no flash photography.

172
00:07:07,243 --> 00:07:10,879
How many pairs of underwear
did you pack for the move?

173
00:07:10,947 --> 00:07:13,282
I don't know. I didn't count.

174
00:07:13,349 --> 00:07:16,785
You truly are the Goofus
to my Gallant.

175
00:07:18,254 --> 00:07:20,222
That's me. Listen,

176
00:07:20,290 --> 00:07:24,593
you and I are gonna
be sharing a bed.

177
00:07:24,661 --> 00:07:27,896
You know, this is uncharted
territory for both of us.

178
00:07:27,964 --> 00:07:29,264
How are you feeling about that?

179
00:07:29,332 --> 00:07:32,735
Oh, excited, concerned,

180
00:07:32,802 --> 00:07:33,802
a little scared.

181
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:35,070
All the same emotions

182
00:07:35,138 --> 00:07:37,306
I feel
in line at Space Mountain.

183
00:07:39,709 --> 00:07:42,077
Well, if you're nervous
about the sleeping arrangements,

184
00:07:42,145 --> 00:07:43,812
maybe we should talk about it.

185
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:45,814
Okay.

186
00:07:48,585 --> 00:07:50,586
Talk.

187
00:07:50,653 --> 00:07:53,956
Well, I imagine
one of your concerns

188
00:07:54,023 --> 00:07:55,758
might be coital
expectations.

189
00:07:55,825 --> 00:07:58,660
Wow, no foreplay or anything,
just right to it.

190
00:08:00,029 --> 00:08:01,764
Look, I know
this experiment

191
00:08:01,831 --> 00:08:04,166
is a big step outside
of your comfort zone.

192
00:08:04,234 --> 00:08:07,636
So why don't we take being
physical off the table

193
00:08:07,704 --> 00:08:09,338
and maybe later on,

194
00:08:09,405 --> 00:08:12,307
once we're more settled in,
we can revisit it.

195
00:08:12,375 --> 00:08:15,144
You're really okay with that?

196
00:08:15,211 --> 00:08:16,779
I've never lived
with someone, either.

197
00:08:16,846 --> 00:08:18,614
This is a lot for me, too.

198
00:08:20,150 --> 00:08:21,350
This is such a relief.

199
00:08:21,417 --> 00:08:23,919
Honestly, if it didn't
get you all worked up,

200
00:08:23,987 --> 00:08:26,655
I'd kiss you right now.

201
00:08:26,723 --> 00:08:28,590
Good call.

202
00:08:28,658 --> 00:08:30,425
Seeing your
Teen Titans underwear

203
00:08:30,493 --> 00:08:32,761
really got my
motor running.

204
00:08:32,829 --> 00:08:35,731
I know. They probably shouldn't
sell those to children.

205
00:08:39,402 --> 00:08:40,869
Well, here's your key.

206
00:08:40,937 --> 00:08:42,237
Thank you.

207
00:08:42,305 --> 00:08:43,872
Enjoy having the place
to yourselves.

208
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:47,576
You enjoy your mission to boldly
go where no man has gone before.

209
00:08:50,013 --> 00:08:51,513
It's Penny's bedroom.

210
00:08:51,581 --> 00:08:53,448
Plenty of men have gone before.

211
00:08:56,519 --> 00:08:59,955
Now, now, there's no need
to make this emotional.

212
00:09:00,023 --> 00:09:02,858
Shall we?

213
00:09:02,926 --> 00:09:04,993
I guess this is it.

214
00:09:05,061 --> 00:09:05,861
You guys have fun.

215
00:09:05,929 --> 00:09:08,363
You, too.

216
00:09:09,232 --> 00:09:11,300
Oh, don't forget.

217
00:09:11,367 --> 00:09:13,802
Tuesday the air filters
need to be changed.

218
00:09:13,870 --> 00:09:15,537
Yeah, you wrote it on my hand.

219
00:09:15,605 --> 00:09:16,705
Oh.

220
00:09:18,274 --> 00:09:19,575
Oh, and every other day,

221
00:09:19,642 --> 00:09:22,010
check the water level
on the avocado pit.

222
00:09:22,078 --> 00:09:23,245
I'm on it.

223
00:09:23,313 --> 00:09:26,248
15 years from now, we'll
make guacamole together.

224
00:09:26,316 --> 00:09:28,317
Leonard, please, let me go.

225
00:09:33,690 --> 00:09:35,624
Come on, Sheldon.

226
00:09:35,692 --> 00:09:37,326
Oh. Bye.

227
00:09:37,393 --> 00:09:39,628
- Good night.
- Good night.

228
00:09:43,566 --> 00:09:45,100
Well, that's it.

229
00:09:45,168 --> 00:09:47,936
For the next five weeks, we are
officially living together.

230
00:09:48,004 --> 00:09:50,439
I guess the experiment begins.

231
00:09:50,506 --> 00:09:51,773
We did it!

232
00:09:51,841 --> 00:09:53,742
Yeah!

233
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:01,074
-= www.OpenSubtitles.org =-

234
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:05,041
Which side of the bed
would you prefer?

235
00:10:05,109 --> 00:10:06,710
Doesn't matter to me.
Your choice.

236
00:10:06,777 --> 00:10:09,713
No, no, we're living together
now-- everything's equal.

237
00:10:09,780 --> 00:10:12,148
You know? I know that I have
a tendency to be controlling,

238
00:10:12,216 --> 00:10:13,617
so I would rather
you choose.

239
00:10:13,684 --> 00:10:15,229
Well, Sheldon,
I really appreciate that,

240
00:10:15,253 --> 00:10:17,587
but these things mean more
to you than they do to me,

241
00:10:17,655 --> 00:10:18,889
so whatever you want.

242
00:10:18,956 --> 00:10:20,400
Well, clearly,
it's <i>not</i> whatever I want,

243
00:10:20,424 --> 00:10:22,926
because what I want is for you
to make this decision,

244
00:10:22,994 --> 00:10:24,661
and you refuse to do that.

245
00:10:24,729 --> 00:10:26,062
Well, I'm not refusing.

246
00:10:26,130 --> 00:10:27,898
I'm just trying
to be considerate.

247
00:10:27,965 --> 00:10:29,799
Like when you
let me get those shoes

248
00:10:29,867 --> 00:10:31,201
with the wheels on the bottom,

249
00:10:31,269 --> 00:10:32,946
and then watched me roll
right into traffic?

250
00:10:32,970 --> 00:10:34,298
Sheldon, will you please
just pick a side?

251
00:10:34,322 --> 00:10:35,390
Fine.

252
00:10:41,913 --> 00:10:44,214
Okay. Now, on this side,

253
00:10:44,282 --> 00:10:48,118
I am closer to the exit
in case of emergency.

254
00:10:48,185 --> 00:10:50,287
Great. That's your side.

255
00:10:50,354 --> 00:10:54,457
No, but I'm also closer to
the entrance in case of attack.

256
00:10:54,525 --> 00:10:57,093
Okay, <i>I'll</i> take that side.

257
00:10:57,161 --> 00:10:58,839
Ah, then again, what are
the odds of someone attacking me?

258
00:10:58,863 --> 00:11:00,330
Rising rapidly.

259
00:11:03,234 --> 00:11:06,903
Now, this side offers me
proximity to the bathroom,

260
00:11:06,971 --> 00:11:09,005
but I am closer to the window

261
00:11:09,073 --> 00:11:11,641
where perverts
can watch me sleep.

262
00:11:11,709 --> 00:11:13,610
Okay.

263
00:11:13,678 --> 00:11:16,279
What if we do this?

264
00:11:18,783 --> 00:11:19,783
I suppose that works.

265
00:11:19,850 --> 00:11:20,951
Great.

266
00:11:24,689 --> 00:11:26,189
Although now I'm kind of worried

267
00:11:26,257 --> 00:11:28,124
someone's hiding
behind those drapes.

268
00:11:31,896 --> 00:11:33,663
This is ridiculous.

269
00:11:33,731 --> 00:11:36,967
The doctor knows what the baby
is, the ultrasound tech knows,

270
00:11:37,034 --> 00:11:38,435
Raj knows,

271
00:11:38,502 --> 00:11:42,138
his <i>Grey's Anatomy</i> online
fan group probably knows.

272
00:11:43,341 --> 00:11:45,075
Is it weird we don't?

273
00:11:45,142 --> 00:11:46,443
I don't know.

274
00:11:46,510 --> 00:11:49,145
Maybe the surprise
will make it more fun.

275
00:11:49,213 --> 00:11:50,814
Like magic tricks.

276
00:11:50,881 --> 00:11:52,616
Remember how disappointed
you were

277
00:11:52,683 --> 00:11:55,251
when I explained
the never-ending hanky?

278
00:11:55,319 --> 00:11:57,487
I was disappointed to see
the man I was engaged to

279
00:11:57,555 --> 00:12:00,624
pulling rainbow scarves
out of his fly.

280
00:12:02,126 --> 00:12:05,328
<i>But</i> how delightful
was it when I pulled out

281
00:12:05,396 --> 00:12:07,897
a bouquet
at the end of those scarves?

282
00:12:07,965 --> 00:12:10,233
It'll be the same thing

283
00:12:10,301 --> 00:12:14,104
when the doctor pulls
a beautiful surprise out of you.

284
00:12:15,373 --> 00:12:18,575
Everyone said I could do better.

285
00:12:18,643 --> 00:12:21,745
But you didn't listen,
and presto change-o,

286
00:12:21,812 --> 00:12:24,114
my baby's inside you. Ta-da!

287
00:12:34,425 --> 00:12:36,092
Ugh. What is that?

288
00:12:45,269 --> 00:12:46,503
Why'd you switch sides?

289
00:12:46,570 --> 00:12:48,672
Be grateful
I'm still in the room.

290
00:12:55,579 --> 00:12:56,913
Comfy?

291
00:12:56,981 --> 00:12:58,882
Oh, I'm just happy
I don't know

292
00:12:58,949 --> 00:13:01,351
what this memory
foam remembers.

293
00:13:01,419 --> 00:13:02,786
Sheldon?

294
00:13:02,853 --> 00:13:05,321
I know we took coitus
off the table,

295
00:13:05,389 --> 00:13:08,591
but I was wondering how you feel
about <i>other</i> forms of intimacy,

296
00:13:08,659 --> 00:13:09,926
such as snuggling.

297
00:13:09,994 --> 00:13:11,661
Well, it's funny
you should ask,

298
00:13:11,729 --> 00:13:14,164
because I was wondering
how <i>you'd</i> feel

299
00:13:14,231 --> 00:13:17,967
about separating the two
of us with a pillow wall.

300
00:13:19,403 --> 00:13:22,672
Sheldon, I've made more than
enough accommodations for you.

301
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:24,774
We're both grown adults--

302
00:13:24,842 --> 00:13:26,362
we've been far more
intimate than this.

303
00:13:26,410 --> 00:13:28,144
If you don't want
to snuggle, fine--

304
00:13:28,212 --> 00:13:29,913
but we're not building
a pillow wall.

305
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:31,181
Okay, well, I am sorry.

306
00:13:31,248 --> 00:13:33,316
I'm just worried that my
sensitivity to temperature

307
00:13:33,384 --> 00:13:35,385
could make this
a rough night.

308
00:13:35,453 --> 00:13:37,587
And no offense, but your
bottom radiates enough heat,

309
00:13:37,655 --> 00:13:39,956
I'm surprised there aren't
iguanas lying on it.

310
00:13:44,528 --> 00:13:46,663
That's it. It's
Sheldon's bedtime.

311
00:13:46,731 --> 00:13:48,198
He is in for the night.

312
00:13:48,265 --> 00:13:51,735
Wow. I cannot believe we are
alone in our own apartment.

313
00:13:51,802 --> 00:13:53,069
It's weird.

314
00:13:53,137 --> 00:13:54,297
This must be how parents feel

315
00:13:54,338 --> 00:13:57,574
when their kid goes off
to college.

316
00:13:57,641 --> 00:14:01,678
Unless they feel sad--
then it's different.

317
00:14:01,746 --> 00:14:02,879
So, what do you want to do?

318
00:14:02,947 --> 00:14:06,616
I know exactly what
we are gonna do.

319
00:14:06,684 --> 00:14:07,817
Really? You're a genius,

320
00:14:07,885 --> 00:14:10,320
and that's the first thing
you come up with?

321
00:14:11,422 --> 00:14:13,156
Hey, Sheldon's
not here,

322
00:14:13,224 --> 00:14:15,225
so we are going
to put on music

323
00:14:15,292 --> 00:14:17,494
and dance in
our underwear.

324
00:14:18,763 --> 00:14:21,598
Ugh. Can we just have sex?

325
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:24,267
Oh, don't worry.

326
00:14:24,335 --> 00:14:27,270
Once you see my sweet moves,
sex is inevitable.

327
00:14:31,408 --> 00:14:33,376
? It was a teenage wedding

328
00:14:33,444 --> 00:14:35,612
? And the old folks
wished them well ?

329
00:14:38,215 --> 00:14:39,415
? You could see that Pierre

330
00:14:39,483 --> 00:14:43,553
? Did truly love
the mademoiselle ?

331
00:14:43,621 --> 00:14:45,755
? And now
the young monsieur... ?

332
00:14:45,823 --> 00:14:47,624
Inevitable, you say?

333
00:14:49,393 --> 00:14:51,594
I'll just let my hips
do the talkin'.

334
00:14:51,662 --> 00:14:54,063
? It goes to show
you never can tell... ?

335
00:14:57,334 --> 00:15:00,069
Screw it. I'm calling
and finding out.

336
00:15:00,137 --> 00:15:01,471
Good. Call him.

337
00:15:05,943 --> 00:15:07,263
Wait, I'm not sure
I want to know.

338
00:15:07,311 --> 00:15:08,878
But you just said
you wanted to know.

339
00:15:08,946 --> 00:15:11,181
Well, now I don't know
if I want to know!

340
00:15:11,982 --> 00:15:13,416
Hello?

341
00:15:13,484 --> 00:15:14,884
Call you back.

342
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:17,987
No, Dr. Feynman.

343
00:15:18,055 --> 00:15:21,191
If I solve it for you,
you'll never learn.

344
00:15:24,228 --> 00:15:26,229
? Tootsee Roll

345
00:15:26,297 --> 00:15:28,431
? Tootsee
Roll ?

346
00:15:28,499 --> 00:15:32,235
? Tootsee Roll,
Tootsee Roll... ?

347
00:15:32,303 --> 00:15:34,337
Wow! Where did you
learn these moves?

348
00:15:34,405 --> 00:15:36,873
The world may have forgotten

349
00:15:36,941 --> 00:15:38,408
but not this smooth criminal.

350
00:15:38,475 --> 00:15:40,109
? To the left, to the left

351
00:15:40,177 --> 00:15:42,378
? To the right, to the right,
to the front. ?

352
00:15:42,446 --> 00:15:44,681
Okay, you're positive
you want to know?

353
00:15:44,748 --> 00:15:47,016
- Yes.
- Okay. Here we go.

354
00:15:47,084 --> 00:15:48,651
It's ringing.

355
00:15:52,056 --> 00:15:53,623
Hello?

356
00:15:53,691 --> 00:15:56,326
- Wait.
- Wrong number.

357
00:16:34,498 --> 00:16:37,767
I told you
not to do the worm.

358
00:16:37,835 --> 00:16:40,503
You were right.

359
00:16:44,909 --> 00:16:46,109
Hello.

360
00:16:46,176 --> 00:16:49,212
I changed my mind!
Hang up! Hang up!

361
00:16:57,755 --> 00:16:59,055
Oh.

362
00:17:05,496 --> 00:17:06,596
Oh.

363
00:17:10,935 --> 00:17:12,468
Oh, gee-- oh!

364
00:17:16,941 --> 00:17:18,741
What are you doing down there?

365
00:17:18,809 --> 00:17:19,809
Hang on.

366
00:17:19,877 --> 00:17:20,944
Who are you calling?

367
00:17:34,451 --> 00:17:36,085
I'm so sore.
I don't think

368
00:17:36,153 --> 00:17:38,221
I slept two minutes last night.

369
00:17:43,994 --> 00:17:45,995
Yeah, get it, girl.

370
00:17:47,064 --> 00:17:49,899
It's not what you think.

371
00:17:49,967 --> 00:17:51,934
I feel like
I pulled something.

372
00:17:52,002 --> 00:17:54,103
Why didn't you tell me to stop?

373
00:17:55,305 --> 00:17:57,740
Even more not
what you think.

374
00:17:58,675 --> 00:18:00,510
I don't know
if I can make it

375
00:18:00,577 --> 00:18:02,345
through five weeks
living with him.

376
00:18:02,413 --> 00:18:04,628
If you ever need a break,
the owner of the train store

377
00:18:04,629 --> 00:18:06,308
will let you leave him there
while you get a coffee.

378
00:18:06,332 --> 00:18:07,793
Yeah.

379
00:18:08,852 --> 00:18:10,153
Good morning.

380
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:12,321
See? I didn't knock,
but it's fine.

381
00:18:12,389 --> 00:18:15,291
I didn't knock, but it's fine.
I didn't knock, but it's fine.

382
00:18:15,359 --> 00:18:17,960
So, how is everyone?

383
00:18:18,028 --> 00:18:20,229
Miserable and exhausted.

384
00:18:20,297 --> 00:18:21,831
Really? I slept great.

385
00:18:21,899 --> 00:18:24,934
Well, I didn't,
and it's your fault.

386
00:18:25,002 --> 00:18:27,837
How? You had the whole floor
to yourself.

387
00:18:30,107 --> 00:18:33,476
Sheldon, maybe living together
is a bad idea.

388
00:18:33,544 --> 00:18:36,112
Well... Yeah, but what kind
of scientists would we be,

389
00:18:36,180 --> 00:18:39,282
drawing a conclusion
after only 12 hours of data?

390
00:18:39,349 --> 00:18:42,718
The kind who almost put a pillow
over your face last night.

391
00:18:44,354 --> 00:18:45,655
Wow.

392
00:18:45,722 --> 00:18:47,623
I anticipated
we'd have problems,

393
00:18:47,691 --> 00:18:51,227
but I never thought your
scientific rigor would be one of them.

394
00:18:51,295 --> 00:18:54,797
I'm sorry, are you questioning
my integrity as a scientist?

395
00:18:54,865 --> 00:18:57,834
If the lab room
disposable shoe cover fits.

396
00:18:59,002 --> 00:19:00,670
Was that a science diss?

397
00:19:00,737 --> 00:19:01,904
- Yeah.
- Was it a good one?

398
00:19:01,972 --> 00:19:03,673
- Eh.
- Ah.

399
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:05,274
What would a
theoretical physicist

400
00:19:05,342 --> 00:19:07,143
understand about an
experiment anyway?

401
00:19:07,211 --> 00:19:09,091
I mean, you wouldn't know
a confounding variable

402
00:19:09,146 --> 00:19:12,281
if two of them hit you in
the face at the same time!

403
00:19:13,851 --> 00:19:15,384
And you don't even
get that joke,

404
00:19:15,452 --> 00:19:18,688
'cause you don't even work
with confounding variables!

405
00:19:19,556 --> 00:19:21,190
How dare you?

406
00:19:21,258 --> 00:19:23,392
Oh, you heard me.
Your experimental bona fides

407
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:24,694
are laughable.

408
00:19:24,761 --> 00:19:27,430
Whoa, whoa! Now you're
making fun of my bona fides?

409
00:19:27,498 --> 00:19:30,233
Can't make fun of something
that's a null set.

410
00:19:31,368 --> 00:19:32,869
I feel like

411
00:19:32,936 --> 00:19:34,337
I should say "damn."
- Do it.

412
00:19:34,404 --> 00:19:36,038
Damn!

413
00:19:36,106 --> 00:19:39,339
Well, if you are so protective
of the scientific method,

414
00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:41,066
perhaps we should use
the next five weeks

415
00:19:41,090 --> 00:19:42,912
to finish what we started.

416
00:19:42,913 --> 00:19:44,914
Well, for science, maybe I will!

417
00:19:44,982 --> 00:19:46,482
For science, maybe you should!

418
00:19:46,550 --> 00:19:47,250
- Fine!
- Fine!

419
00:19:47,317 --> 00:19:48,851
- Good.
- Great.

420
00:19:48,919 --> 00:19:50,987
Do you want to go to our place
and make out?

421
00:19:51,054 --> 00:19:52,855
Does Stephen Hawking roll
through the quad?

422
00:19:59,963 --> 00:20:02,665
The new neighbors
are weird.
