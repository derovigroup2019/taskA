00:00:01,149 --> 00:00:02,549
<i>Previously on</i>
The Big Bang Theory...

2
00:00:03,266 --> 00:00:04,866
Sheldon, did you just figure out

3
00:00:04,868 --> 00:00:08,136
a method for synthesizing a new
stable super-heavy element?

4
00:00:08,257 --> 00:00:09,940
Did I?!

5
00:00:09,942 --> 00:00:11,208
Well, that can't be right.

6
00:00:11,210 --> 00:00:12,909
No one's ever done that before.

7
00:00:12,911 --> 00:00:14,377
Except me because I just did it!

8
00:00:14,379 --> 00:00:16,546
? Sheldon and his brain, yeah

9
00:00:16,548 --> 00:00:18,582
? Sheldon and his brain,
yeah! ?

10
00:00:18,584 --> 00:00:20,950
I've made a horrible mistake.

11
00:00:20,952 --> 00:00:22,052
What are you talking about?

12
00:00:22,054 --> 00:00:24,787
This table,
it's in square centimeters

13
00:00:24,789 --> 00:00:26,806
I read it as square meters.

14
00:00:26,808 --> 00:00:28,258
You know what that means?

15
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:30,844
That Americans can't handle
the metric system?

16
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:36,266
Amy, I was off
by a factor of 10,000.

17
00:00:36,268 --> 00:00:38,685
But the Chinese team
found the element.

18
00:00:38,687 --> 00:00:39,653
Yeah, well, they shouldn't have.

19
00:00:39,655 --> 00:00:41,605
My calculations were wrong.

20
00:00:41,607 --> 00:00:43,573
The greatest scientific
achievement of my life

21
00:00:43,575 --> 00:00:45,308
is based on a blunder.

22
00:00:45,310 --> 00:00:46,610
I'm not a genius.

23
00:00:46,612 --> 00:00:47,944
I'm a fraud.

24
00:00:47,946 --> 00:00:50,113
You know, Sheldon,
in neuroscience,

25
00:00:50,115 --> 00:00:52,815
we're forever finding something
in one part of the brain

26
00:00:52,817 --> 00:00:54,284
that we thought was
someplace else.

27
00:00:54,286 --> 00:00:56,986
Oh, great, now I'm
worse than a fraud.

28
00:00:56,988 --> 00:00:59,155
I'm practically a biologist.
someplace else.

29
00:01:01,759 --> 00:01:04,261
This is <i>Science Friday.</i>
I'm Ira Flatow.

30
00:01:04,263 --> 00:01:07,597
My guest today is responsible
for the discovery of the first

31
00:01:07,599 --> 00:01:10,166
stable super-heavy element.

32
00:01:10,168 --> 00:01:11,685
Welcome, Dr. Sheldon Cooper.

33
00:01:11,687 --> 00:01:13,436
Thank you.

34
00:01:13,438 --> 00:01:15,021
Uh, the university
made me come here.

35
00:01:15,023 --> 00:01:16,506
I didn't want to.

36
00:01:17,325 --> 00:01:20,360
Uh, big fan of the show.

37
00:01:20,362 --> 00:01:23,346
So, I understand
that you actually discovered

38
00:01:23,348 --> 00:01:25,532
this element by mistake.

39
00:01:27,486 --> 00:01:29,319
Yes.

40
00:01:29,321 --> 00:01:32,372
And some people in the science
community are calling it

41
00:01:32,374 --> 00:01:34,357
"The Wonder Blunder."

42
00:01:34,359 --> 00:01:36,025
Who? Give me their names.

43
00:01:36,027 --> 00:01:37,911
I bet it's Wolowitz.

44
00:01:37,913 --> 00:01:40,297
It's just such
a fascinating story.

45
00:01:40,299 --> 00:01:41,831
Your calculations are way off,

46
00:01:41,833 --> 00:01:44,200
but they find
the element anyway.

47
00:01:44,202 --> 00:01:46,503
It's like misreading
a treasure map

48
00:01:46,505 --> 00:01:48,922
and still finding the treasure.

49
00:01:48,924 --> 00:01:50,924
Can we talk
about something else?

50
00:01:50,926 --> 00:01:53,510
Do you know that I yodel?

51
00:01:55,846 --> 00:01:57,230
That's interesting,
but this could be taking you

52
00:01:57,232 --> 00:01:59,983
down the path
toward a Nobel Prize.

53
00:01:59,985 --> 00:02:01,351
And in chemistry, no less.

54
00:02:01,353 --> 00:02:03,503
And wouldn't
that be unusual?

55
00:02:03,505 --> 00:02:05,855
Because you're a physicist.

56
00:02:05,857 --> 00:02:08,158
Yes, yes, I'd be a physicist
with a Nobel in chemistry.

57
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:10,360
Everyone laugh
at the circus freak.

58
00:02:11,612 --> 00:02:14,164
You know, I don't need to sit
here and take this, Flatow.

59
00:02:14,166 --> 00:02:16,499
It is because of bullies
like you,

60
00:02:16,501 --> 00:02:18,201
every day
more and more Americans

61
00:02:18,203 --> 00:02:20,704
are making the switch
to television.

62
00:02:21,789 --> 00:02:25,425
? Our whole universe
was in a hot, dense state ?

63
00:02:25,427 --> 00:02:28,762
? Then nearly 14 billion years
ago expansion started... Wait! ?

64
00:02:28,764 --> 00:02:30,397
? The Earth ban to cool

65
00:02:30,399 --> 00:02:32,932
? The autotrophs began to drool,
Neanderthals developed tools ?

66
00:02:32,934 --> 00:02:35,602
? We built the Wall
? <i>We built the pyramids</i> ?

67
00:02:35,604 --> 00:02:38,271
? Math, Science, History,
unraveling the mystery ?

68
00:02:38,273 --> 00:02:40,190
? That all started
with a big bang ?

69
00:02:40,192 --> 00:02:42,142
? <i>Bang!</i> ?

00:02:51,176 --> 00:02:53,811
President Seibert, I don't
know why you're yelling.

73
00:02:53,813 --> 00:02:56,180
You're the one who made me
go on the radio.

74
00:02:56,182 --> 00:02:59,017
I was expecting a professional
science interview,

75
00:02:59,019 --> 00:03:02,837
not an attack
by some morning zoo shock jock.

76
00:03:04,306 --> 00:03:06,240
Well, if the university
needs money so badly,

77
00:03:06,242 --> 00:03:09,027
perhaps you should start
a swear jar.

78
00:03:10,329 --> 00:03:13,364
Whoa! That one's worth a dollar.

79
00:03:14,666 --> 00:03:16,034
I know you don't like it,

80
00:03:16,036 --> 00:03:17,368
but every time
you do an interview,

81
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:19,403
it raises the profile
of the university.

82
00:03:19,405 --> 00:03:21,072
That translates to funding.

83
00:03:21,074 --> 00:03:22,090
Yeah, well, I'm not just

84
00:03:22,092 --> 00:03:25,910
some trained monkey
dancing for coins.

85
00:03:25,912 --> 00:03:27,011
Of course you're not.

86
00:03:27,013 --> 00:03:29,047
People love trained monkeys.

87
00:03:31,266 --> 00:03:32,300
How can you not be happy?

88
00:03:32,302 --> 00:03:34,018
You're tall, thin and famous.

89
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:37,138
Oh, my God,
I'm jealous of Sheldon.

90
00:03:38,390 --> 00:03:39,974
Look, you're gonna be doing
this stuff for a while.

91
00:03:39,976 --> 00:03:42,360
You're just gonna have to find
a way to get used to it.

92
00:03:42,362 --> 00:03:44,261
But none of you know
what this is like.

93
00:03:44,263 --> 00:03:47,431
Being celebrated for something
you wish you never did.

94
00:03:47,433 --> 00:03:50,651
Mmm... you clearly haven't been
with me at Mardi Gras.

95
00:03:54,123 --> 00:03:56,290
Want to pause the video game
and help me clean up?

96
00:03:56,292 --> 00:03:57,458
I am cleaning up.

97
00:03:57,460 --> 00:03:59,877
Look at the mess the Joker made
of Gotham City.

98
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:03,915
Come on, it's your friend
who's coming to stay here.

99
00:04:03,917 --> 00:04:05,299
Raj grew up in India.

100
00:04:05,301 --> 00:04:07,635
Trust me, he's seen worse.

101
00:04:08,303 --> 00:04:09,453
Howie.

102
00:04:09,455 --> 00:04:10,638
I promise I'll help out

103
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:11,672
the rest of the week.

104
00:04:11,674 --> 00:04:12,807
The rest of the week?

105
00:04:12,809 --> 00:04:14,625
You said it was just gonna be
a night or two.

106
00:04:14,627 --> 00:04:15,676
Yeah, but if I told you a week,

107
00:04:15,678 --> 00:04:16,594
would you have said yes?

108
00:04:16,596 --> 00:04:20,348
No!
Then you left me no choice.

109
00:04:20,350 --> 00:04:24,018
I love Raj, but that's
a long time for a house guest.

110
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:25,686
I know, but they're
tenting his building.

111
00:04:25,688 --> 00:04:28,072
He can't find a hotel
he likes that allows dogs.

112
00:04:28,074 --> 00:04:29,640
He's bringing Cinnamon?

113
00:04:29,642 --> 00:04:30,641
For a whole week!

114
00:04:30,643 --> 00:04:32,660
The nerve of some people.

115
00:04:35,197 --> 00:04:39,117
Here comes
the Embarrassment Express.

116
00:04:39,985 --> 00:04:42,587
With stops at Fraudville...

117
00:04:42,589 --> 00:04:45,089
WonderBlunderberg...

118
00:04:45,091 --> 00:04:48,042
and Kansas City.

119
00:04:48,044 --> 00:04:49,310
Because it's a hub.

120
00:04:51,815 --> 00:04:53,281
Sheldon, can I come in?

121
00:04:53,283 --> 00:04:54,932
Do you have cookies?
No.

122
00:04:54,934 --> 00:04:56,884
Good. I don't deserve cookies.
Come in.

123
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:00,171
Wil...?

124
00:05:00,173 --> 00:05:01,105
Hey, Sheldon.

125
00:05:01,107 --> 00:05:02,023
It's been a while.

126
00:05:02,025 --> 00:05:03,524
Why are you here?

127
00:05:03,526 --> 00:05:04,559
Amy said you were
having a rough time,

128
00:05:04,561 --> 00:05:06,144
and I thought maybe
we could talk.

129
00:05:06,146 --> 00:05:07,011
Is that okay?

130
00:05:07,013 --> 00:05:08,646
Certainly.

131
00:05:08,648 --> 00:05:09,680
Although...

132
00:05:09,682 --> 00:05:11,232
right now,
I'm having a rough time

133
00:05:11,234 --> 00:05:12,900
because there's
three people in my room,

134
00:05:12,902 --> 00:05:15,920
and it's starting to feel
like a discotheque.

135
00:05:17,372 --> 00:05:19,574
Sheldon, you said you were
unhappy getting attention

136
00:05:19,576 --> 00:05:21,859
for something you wished
you never did.

137
00:05:21,861 --> 00:05:23,694
Yeah, I know a little
something about that.

138
00:05:23,696 --> 00:05:25,746
Oh, nonsense, Wil.

139
00:05:25,748 --> 00:05:29,300
Your endless tweets are
not that bad.

140
00:05:29,302 --> 00:05:31,719
I remember why
it's been a while.

141
00:05:31,721 --> 00:05:34,172
Sheldon, I was actually talking

142
00:05:34,174 --> 00:05:35,873
about when I was a kid
on <i>Star Trek.</i>

143
00:05:35,875 --> 00:05:38,392
How could you not
like getting attention

144
00:05:38,394 --> 00:05:39,877
for playing Wesley Crusher?

145
00:05:39,879 --> 00:05:41,996
You were wonderful.

146
00:05:41,998 --> 00:05:44,732
A know-it-all boy genius
with an eidetic memory.

147
00:05:44,734 --> 00:05:47,568
Who couldn't relate to that?

148
00:05:48,437 --> 00:05:50,238
Well, not everybody
felt that way.

149
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,989
A lot of people
really hated the character,

150
00:05:51,991 --> 00:05:54,242
and some of them
hated me because of it.

151
00:05:54,244 --> 00:05:55,226
I would do interviews,

152
00:05:55,228 --> 00:05:56,894
and people would be mean to me.

153
00:05:56,896 --> 00:05:59,163
That just happened to me.

154
00:05:59,165 --> 00:06:00,915
Next time you're stuck
for a tweet,

155
00:06:00,917 --> 00:06:04,202
feel free to say
what a jerk Ira Flatow is.

156
00:06:04,204 --> 00:06:07,288
Sheldon, the point is
Wil learned to embrace

157
00:06:07,290 --> 00:06:10,574
that part of his life and moved
on to bigger and better things.

158
00:06:10,576 --> 00:06:12,076
Yeah, I'm an author now,

159
00:06:12,078 --> 00:06:13,628
I do public speaking,

160
00:06:13,630 --> 00:06:15,796
and I have my own Web series
about board games.

161
00:06:15,798 --> 00:06:17,181
Uh...

162
00:06:17,183 --> 00:06:19,050
We're trying
to cheer him up, so...

163
00:06:24,056 --> 00:06:26,023
I'm just saying
that there was a time

164
00:06:26,025 --> 00:06:28,526
when I thought I would never get
out of Wesley Crusher's shadow.

165
00:06:28,528 --> 00:06:29,860
But now,

166
00:06:29,862 --> 00:06:32,313
it's just one small part
of a pretty great life,

167
00:06:32,315 --> 00:06:34,431
and it's a part
that I'm happy is there.

168
00:06:34,433 --> 00:06:36,734
I do see what you're saying.

169
00:06:36,736 --> 00:06:38,236
That helps.

170
00:06:38,238 --> 00:06:39,370
Good.

171
00:06:39,372 --> 00:06:40,605
Would you two like to stay

172
00:06:40,607 --> 00:06:41,639
and play trains with me?

173
00:06:41,641 --> 00:06:42,707
Sure.
Okay.

174
00:06:42,709 --> 00:06:43,774
Oh, great!

175
00:06:43,776 --> 00:06:47,111
Now...

176
00:06:47,113 --> 00:06:48,112
I work the controls.

177
00:06:48,114 --> 00:06:49,297
I say "All aboard""

178
00:06:49,299 --> 00:06:52,283
You sit quietly and watch.

179
00:06:52,285 --> 00:06:54,385
Can I blow the whistle?

180
00:06:55,754 --> 00:06:57,755
You should probably go.

181
00:07:05,314 --> 00:07:07,415
You're gonna brush
your teeth on my couch?

182
00:07:07,417 --> 00:07:10,568
No, I'm gonna brush
Cinnamon's teeth.

183
00:07:10,570 --> 00:07:11,686
Why bother?

184
00:07:11,688 --> 00:07:12,820
She spends half the time

185
00:07:12,822 --> 00:07:14,322
licking her butt.

186
00:07:15,274 --> 00:07:16,741
And the other half
licking my face.

187
00:07:16,743 --> 00:07:18,809
That's why I'm brushing
her teeth.

188
00:07:20,645 --> 00:07:22,646
Hey, guys.
Sorry I'm so late.

189
00:07:22,648 --> 00:07:23,647
Did you already have dinner?

190
00:07:23,649 --> 00:07:25,249
No, we were waiting for you.

191
00:07:25,251 --> 00:07:26,500
Aw, that's so sweet.

192
00:07:26,502 --> 00:07:28,753
Yeah. So what do you
feel like making?

193
00:07:30,322 --> 00:07:31,505
Howard, the poor thing

194
00:07:31,507 --> 00:07:32,506
just got home from work.

195
00:07:32,508 --> 00:07:34,658
Let me get you a glass of wine.

196
00:07:34,660 --> 00:07:36,177
I'll cook dinner.

197
00:07:36,179 --> 00:07:38,129
- Oh, Raj, you're our guest.
- Don't be silly.

198
00:07:38,131 --> 00:07:40,164
Sit. You look
like you've had a long day.

199
00:07:40,166 --> 00:07:43,150
No, she always
looks like that.

200
00:07:45,554 --> 00:07:48,939
Because she married an idiot.

201
00:07:49,691 --> 00:07:51,592
Thank you, Raj.

202
00:07:51,594 --> 00:07:52,810
Please, this is

203
00:07:52,812 --> 00:07:54,528
my way of thanking you

204
00:07:54,530 --> 00:07:56,364
for letting me stay here.

205
00:07:56,366 --> 00:07:59,317
Now, tell us all about your day.

206
00:07:59,319 --> 00:08:01,319
Okay, um, well, first,

207
00:08:01,321 --> 00:08:03,287
I was late to a meeting
'cause I was stuck in traffic.

208
00:08:03,289 --> 00:08:06,290
Well, I keep telling you to put
that traffic app on your phone.

209
00:08:06,292 --> 00:08:08,192
Hey, when you got home today
complaining that you felt sick

210
00:08:08,194 --> 00:08:09,526
from eating
too many jelly beans,

211
00:08:09,528 --> 00:08:10,661
did I tell you how to fix it?

212
00:08:10,663 --> 00:08:11,862
No.

213
00:08:13,548 --> 00:08:17,534
I said, "Aw, that must hurt,"
and I rubbed your belly.

214
00:08:20,872 --> 00:08:23,090
I thought of you
the whole time.

215
00:08:26,228 --> 00:08:28,179
All I'm saying is there's
a time to just listen.

216
00:08:28,181 --> 00:08:29,513
Thank you.

217
00:08:29,515 --> 00:08:30,598
There's also a time to stop

218
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:31,682
eating too many jelly beans.

219
00:08:31,684 --> 00:08:33,851
And it's when you're ten.

220
00:08:36,655 --> 00:08:38,255
Hello, President Siebert.

221
00:08:38,257 --> 00:08:39,774
Thank you for taking my call.

222
00:08:39,776 --> 00:08:42,576
I just wanted you to know
that you can now expect

223
00:08:42,578 --> 00:08:46,414
enthusiastic participation
from me regarding my discovery.

224
00:08:46,416 --> 00:08:47,698
Oh, no, no, no, no.

225
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:48,999
No need to thank me.

226
00:08:49,001 --> 00:08:51,786
Thank my friend, Wil Wheaton.

227
00:08:51,788 --> 00:08:55,005
For your information,
I have nine friends, hmm?

228
00:08:56,208 --> 00:08:59,410
Ten if we include you.

229
00:08:59,412 --> 00:09:01,595
Nine it is.

230
00:09:04,182 --> 00:09:06,183
Ah, it's ten.

231
00:09:06,185 --> 00:09:08,018
I'll count Wolowitz.

232
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:10,771
Hello, friend Leonard.

233
00:09:10,773 --> 00:09:12,056
Hey, you're in a good mood.

234
00:09:12,058 --> 00:09:14,024
I'm in a great mood.

235
00:09:14,026 --> 00:09:15,893
Well, you're about to be
in an even better one.

236
00:09:15,895 --> 00:09:17,261
I didn't want
to say anything

237
00:09:17,263 --> 00:09:18,646
until I knew for sure, but...

238
00:09:18,648 --> 00:09:21,365
I've been re-running the tests
on your element in my lab

239
00:09:21,367 --> 00:09:22,900
and I disproved it.

240
00:09:22,902 --> 00:09:24,702
Your element does not exist!

241
00:09:25,737 --> 00:09:27,471
Yeah, but what about
the Chinese research team?

242
00:09:27,473 --> 00:09:28,572
They found it.

243
00:09:28,574 --> 00:09:29,957
Yeah, it turns out someone added

244
00:09:29,959 --> 00:09:32,443
simulated signals
to the data files.

245
00:09:32,445 --> 00:09:34,128
They faked the results.

246
00:09:34,130 --> 00:09:35,129
Really?

247
00:09:35,131 --> 00:09:36,864
Yes! Do you know
what that means?

248
00:09:36,866 --> 00:09:39,884
That means all of this attention
that you hate goes away.

249
00:09:39,886 --> 00:09:41,118
So no more interviews?

250
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:42,119
No, it's all over.

251
00:09:42,121 --> 00:09:43,220
I can't believe it.

252
00:09:43,222 --> 00:09:44,121
Well, you're welcome.

253
00:09:44,123 --> 00:09:45,122
You robbed me

254
00:09:45,124 --> 00:09:47,057
of my greatest achievement!

255
00:09:48,043 --> 00:09:49,009
What?!

256
00:09:49,011 --> 00:09:51,812
I'm back down
to nine friends!

257
00:09:51,814 --> 00:09:55,232
Make it eight--
I'm sick of Wolowitz, too!

258
00:09:55,234 --> 00:09:57,735
I-I don't understand.

259
00:09:57,737 --> 00:09:59,353
All you've done
since you discovered

260
00:09:59,355 --> 00:10:00,771
this stupid element
was complain.

261
00:10:00,773 --> 00:10:02,106
I was trying to make you happy!

262
00:10:02,108 --> 00:10:04,742
By taking away
my only claim to fame?

263
00:10:04,744 --> 00:10:06,410
Well, if you wanted
to make me happy,

264
00:10:06,412 --> 00:10:07,828
you could have told me a joke.

265
00:10:07,830 --> 00:10:09,113
Or shown me a cute video

266
00:10:09,115 --> 00:10:11,148
of a koala and an otter

267
00:10:11,150 --> 00:10:12,649
becoming unlikely friends.

268
00:10:12,651 --> 00:10:16,036
Oh, there is
no winning with you.

269
00:10:16,038 --> 00:10:18,422
And koalas and otters don't
even live near each other!

270
00:10:18,424 --> 00:10:21,425
That's what makes
their friendship unlikely!

271
00:10:21,427 --> 00:10:23,043
Hey!

272
00:10:23,045 --> 00:10:24,345
What's with all the yelling?

273
00:10:24,347 --> 00:10:26,430
Leonard disproved my element.

274
00:10:26,432 --> 00:10:28,766
Now all the attention
is going to go away.

275
00:10:28,768 --> 00:10:30,267
Oh, that's great.
You must be thrilled!

276
00:10:30,269 --> 00:10:33,687
That's it!
I'm down to seven friends.

277
00:10:33,689 --> 00:10:37,391
He's counting hobbits
and superheroes, right?

278
00:10:37,393 --> 00:10:40,644
When I thought the element
was real, I didn't want it.

279
00:10:40,646 --> 00:10:42,480
But now that Leonard
made it not exist,

280
00:10:42,482 --> 00:10:44,982
I want it more
than anything in the world.

281
00:10:44,984 --> 00:10:46,567
The-the element never existed.

282
00:10:46,569 --> 00:10:48,352
I didn't take it away,
science took it away.

283
00:10:48,354 --> 00:10:49,453
Be mad at science.

284
00:10:49,455 --> 00:10:52,456
Don't you dare use
science against me.

285
00:10:52,458 --> 00:10:54,992
Science is my best friend!

286
00:10:54,994 --> 00:10:56,460
Oh, good,
I'm back up to eight.

287
00:10:57,829 --> 00:11:00,047
Will you tell him
he's out of his mind.

288
00:11:00,049 --> 00:11:01,348
Actually, I get
what he's saying.

289
00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:02,716
Oh, yes! Nine!

290
00:11:02,718 --> 00:11:03,717
Welcome back, buddy.

291
00:11:06,004 --> 00:11:08,038
It's like if you're dating
someone you're not that into,

292
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:09,306
and then they break up with you

293
00:11:09,308 --> 00:11:10,724
and then you want them
more than ever.

294
00:11:10,726 --> 00:11:12,426
I have no idea what
she's talking about.

295
00:11:12,428 --> 00:11:15,813
but we're ganged up
on you so I agree.

296
00:11:16,714 --> 00:11:18,882
Okay, Sheldon, what do you
want me to do,

297
00:11:18,884 --> 00:11:20,484
hide the information?

298
00:11:20,486 --> 00:11:21,852
If I don't publish it,

299
00:11:21,854 --> 00:11:23,237
it's just a matter of time
before someone else does.

300
00:11:23,239 --> 00:11:25,022
No, no, of course
you have to publish.

301
00:11:25,024 --> 00:11:26,957
That's your responsibility
as a scientist.

302
00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:28,609
Doing otherwise
would be unethical.

303
00:11:28,611 --> 00:11:29,893
You have no choice.

304
00:11:29,895 --> 00:11:31,662
Fine, I'll publish.

305
00:11:31,664 --> 00:11:33,364
Can you believe this guy?

306
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:41,074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

307
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:45,481
Aw! Raj did the dishes.

308
00:11:45,483 --> 00:11:47,033
How do you know
I didn't do them?

309
00:11:47,035 --> 00:11:48,768
Because once, when all
the knives were dirty,

310
00:11:48,770 --> 00:11:51,604
you cut a bagel with your keys.

311
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:54,874
Good morning, everybody.

312
00:11:54,876 --> 00:11:57,009
I picked up coffee
while I was out.

313
00:11:57,011 --> 00:11:59,629
Bernadette, here's
your soy peppermint mocha.

314
00:11:59,631 --> 00:12:01,798
Aw, you didn't have to do that.

315
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:02,932
Oh, my pleasure, and don't worry

316
00:12:02,934 --> 00:12:04,000
about your presentation today.

317
00:12:04,002 --> 00:12:05,218
You're gonna be great.

318
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:07,420
Yeah, you're gonna
knock it out of the park.

319
00:12:07,422 --> 00:12:09,622
What presentation
do I have today?

320
00:12:11,058 --> 00:12:12,675
Just go.

321
00:12:16,013 --> 00:12:18,181
He loves you.

322
00:12:18,183 --> 00:12:19,148
What are you doing?

323
00:12:19,150 --> 00:12:20,600
Are you trying
to make me look bad?

324
00:12:20,602 --> 00:12:22,134
I'm just being
a good house guest.

325
00:12:22,136 --> 00:12:23,603
No, you're being
a better husband than I am.

326
00:12:23,605 --> 00:12:25,354
Doing the dishes,
getting coffee,

327
00:12:25,356 --> 00:12:26,572
knowing about her life--

328
00:12:26,574 --> 00:12:28,474
who does that?

329
00:12:28,476 --> 00:12:31,110
Oh, come on,
I brought you one, too.

330
00:12:31,112 --> 00:12:32,795
I don't want coffee.

331
00:12:32,797 --> 00:12:34,247
That's why I got you
hot chocolate.

332
00:12:34,249 --> 00:12:36,332
Give me that.

333
00:12:36,334 --> 00:12:39,035
Just stop showing me up.

334
00:12:39,037 --> 00:12:40,586
Howard, listen to me.

335
00:12:40,588 --> 00:12:41,987
You're a great husband.

336
00:12:41,989 --> 00:12:44,590
Yes, your listening skills
could use some work.

337
00:12:44,592 --> 00:12:47,794
But it's amazing how far
you've come given that you're

338
00:12:47,796 --> 00:12:51,264
an only child raised
by an over-protective mom.

339
00:12:51,266 --> 00:12:53,883
Um, is this getting weird?

340
00:12:53,885 --> 00:12:54,934
Hang on.

341
00:12:59,389 --> 00:13:02,225
So, yes.

342
00:13:03,393 --> 00:13:05,595
Hey.

343
00:13:05,597 --> 00:13:07,947
I just wanted to let you know
that I-I posted my findings.

344
00:13:07,949 --> 00:13:09,181
I saw.

345
00:13:09,183 --> 00:13:10,533
And I just

346
00:13:10,535 --> 00:13:12,618
posted a retraction of my paper.

347
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:15,621
Now the whole scientific
community knows I was wrong.

348
00:13:15,623 --> 00:13:18,291
These things happen
all the time, Sheldon.

349
00:13:18,293 --> 00:13:19,458
Not to me.

350
00:13:19,460 --> 00:13:21,544
The only other retraction
I ever had to issue

351
00:13:21,546 --> 00:13:24,213
was when I was seven
and I conceded that my brother

352
00:13:24,215 --> 00:13:26,916
was the greatest ninja
in East Texas.

353
00:13:28,168 --> 00:13:30,449
But that was just a ploy to get
my face out of his armpit.

354
00:13:31,722 --> 00:13:34,056
There he is!

355
00:13:35,208 --> 00:13:36,809
It's my favorite superhero--

356
00:13:36,811 --> 00:13:39,595
the Retractor!

357
00:13:40,731 --> 00:13:43,399
Come on, don't give him
a hard time.

358
00:13:43,401 --> 00:13:44,684
I'm sorry, Cooper.

359
00:13:44,686 --> 00:13:46,886
I retract it.

360
00:13:47,821 --> 00:13:49,655
By the way, Hofstadter,

361
00:13:49,657 --> 00:13:52,191
nice job disproving
the Chinese team.

362
00:13:52,193 --> 00:13:53,276
It's not a big deal.

363
00:13:53,278 --> 00:13:54,911
It's a huge deal.

364
00:13:54,913 --> 00:13:57,897
Cooper, maybe physics
just isn't your thing.

365
00:13:58,899 --> 00:14:00,750
Have you ever considered
a career in retail?

366
00:14:00,752 --> 00:14:04,003
That way you could take
things back for a living.

367
00:14:05,455 --> 00:14:06,505
Okay, Barry, that's enough.

368
00:14:06,507 --> 00:14:07,907
Oh, no, that's okay.

369
00:14:07,909 --> 00:14:09,876
I can fight my own battles.

370
00:14:09,878 --> 00:14:12,962
Isn't that right, "Bawwy."

371
00:14:14,581 --> 00:14:16,432
Is...?

372
00:14:16,434 --> 00:14:19,018
Is that a reference
to my speech impediment?

373
00:14:20,470 --> 00:14:23,055
That's pretty hurtful.

374
00:14:23,057 --> 00:14:24,473
I...

375
00:14:24,475 --> 00:14:26,475
I can't control it.

376
00:14:27,945 --> 00:14:29,028
You're right,

377
00:14:29,030 --> 00:14:31,063
That was uncalled for.

378
00:14:31,065 --> 00:14:32,481
I take it back.

379
00:14:32,483 --> 00:14:33,449
Of course you do.

380
00:14:33,451 --> 00:14:35,451
Because you're the Retractor!

381
00:14:39,823 --> 00:14:41,991
Raj, this dinner was amazing.

382
00:14:41,993 --> 00:14:43,108
If you're here much longer,

383
00:14:43,110 --> 00:14:45,127
I'm gonna have
to buy bigger clothes.

384
00:14:45,129 --> 00:14:46,111
Nonsense.

385
00:14:46,113 --> 00:14:47,296
You need
a little fattening up.

386
00:14:47,298 --> 00:14:49,281
You've been looking
too skinny lately.

387
00:14:49,283 --> 00:14:50,616
Aw.

388
00:14:50,618 --> 00:14:53,135
Howie, how come you never
say anything sweet like that?

389
00:14:53,137 --> 00:14:54,119
What are you talking about?

390
00:14:54,121 --> 00:14:55,338
Remember last week,
when I asked you

391
00:14:55,340 --> 00:14:56,722
if you were wearing Spanx
and you weren't?

392
00:14:56,724 --> 00:14:59,008
How's that different?

393
00:15:00,510 --> 00:15:02,011
Maybe you could try being
more thoughtful,

394
00:15:02,013 --> 00:15:03,629
like your friend Raj.

395
00:15:03,631 --> 00:15:06,148
Yeah, well, maybe you could
try being more like Raj.

396
00:15:06,150 --> 00:15:07,233
Oh, really?

397
00:15:07,235 --> 00:15:08,150
Yeah, yeah.

398
00:15:08,152 --> 00:15:09,568
He packed me
a lunch this morning.

399
00:15:09,570 --> 00:15:12,772
And there was a note inside
that said, "Go get 'em""

400
00:15:12,774 --> 00:15:15,358
Like I don't do enough
around here.

401
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:16,659
Now I need
to pack your lunch?

402
00:15:16,661 --> 00:15:18,310
And by the way, why do you need
a note telling you

403
00:15:18,312 --> 00:15:19,745
to "go get 'em"?
You're a grown man!

404
00:15:19,747 --> 00:15:21,080
You should know to "go get 'em"!

405
00:15:21,982 --> 00:15:23,366
I do know to "go get 'em""

406
00:15:23,368 --> 00:15:25,051
but sometimes it's nice
to have emotional support

407
00:15:25,053 --> 00:15:27,486
when I'm going and getting them!

408
00:15:27,488 --> 00:15:29,922
Hey, hey, do you
hear yourselves?

409
00:15:29,924 --> 00:15:33,209
Let's just, you know, all calm
down and take a step back.

410
00:15:33,211 --> 00:15:35,311
This is stupid.

411
00:15:35,313 --> 00:15:36,512
Why are we fighting?

412
00:15:36,514 --> 00:15:37,546
I don't know.

413
00:15:37,548 --> 00:15:38,998
I guess I was just feeling

414
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,833
like I'm a lousy husband.

415
00:15:40,835 --> 00:15:42,351
You're not a lousy husband.

416
00:15:42,353 --> 00:15:43,636
You're a great husband.

417
00:15:43,638 --> 00:15:45,888
I was the one feeling
like a lousy wife.

418
00:15:45,890 --> 00:15:48,140
Are you kidding?
You're the best.

419
00:15:48,142 --> 00:15:49,692
I know what the problem is.

420
00:15:49,694 --> 00:15:51,377
It's him!

421
00:15:52,195 --> 00:15:54,313
Oh, what did I do?

422
00:15:54,315 --> 00:15:56,682
You made us feel like we're
not trying hard enough.

423
00:15:56,684 --> 00:15:58,350
Yeah, we were totally fine
half-assing our marriage

424
00:15:58,352 --> 00:16:00,252
till you showed up.

425
00:16:00,254 --> 00:16:02,955
Look, I'm sorry
you're upset with me,

426
00:16:02,957 --> 00:16:04,657
but I just have to say
it's nice to see

427
00:16:04,659 --> 00:16:06,191
the two of you on the same page.

428
00:16:06,193 --> 00:16:07,860
Oh, it does feel good

429
00:16:07,862 --> 00:16:09,462
to have you backing
me up for once.

430
00:16:09,464 --> 00:16:11,779
I back you up all the time!
That is not...

431
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:14,147
He's doing it again!
What is wrong with you?!

432
00:16:15,719 --> 00:16:17,420
I can't believe
they kicked you out.

433
00:16:17,422 --> 00:16:21,057
I can't believe
they're still married.

434
00:16:21,059 --> 00:16:24,560
Oh, no, I forgot Cinnamon's
toothbrush at Howard's.

435
00:16:24,562 --> 00:16:27,313
I guess you're sharing
with Daddy again.

436
00:16:32,352 --> 00:16:34,737
Bark once if you need me
to call PETA.

437
00:16:37,607 --> 00:16:40,326
What's that animal doing
in our apartment?

438
00:16:40,328 --> 00:16:42,611
Oh, relax, she's in her crate.
She can't get out.

439
00:16:42,613 --> 00:16:44,330
I have two words for you:

440
00:16:44,332 --> 00:16:46,365
<i>Jurassic Park.</i>

441
00:16:46,367 --> 00:16:49,585
This day just keeps
getting worse and worse.

442
00:16:49,587 --> 00:16:51,120
You know, if it makes
you feel any better...

443
00:16:51,122 --> 00:16:52,088
It probably won't.

444
00:16:52,090 --> 00:16:53,205
You're probably right.

445
00:16:53,207 --> 00:16:56,258
Sheldon, it's a beautiful night.

446
00:16:56,260 --> 00:16:58,878
Why don't you and I
go for a nice walk together?

447
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:01,430
Oh, everything is just sex
with you isn't it?

448
00:17:02,916 --> 00:17:05,518
Sheldon, I think
you might find the support

449
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:07,086
you're looking for,
if you realize

450
00:17:07,088 --> 00:17:09,305
that relationships
are a give and take.

451
00:17:09,307 --> 00:17:10,756
She can only be there for you

452
00:17:10,758 --> 00:17:12,641
as much as you are for her.

453
00:17:12,643 --> 00:17:14,443
Thank you, Rajesh.

454
00:17:14,445 --> 00:17:16,762
And, Amy, you need
to be patient with Sheldon,

455
00:17:16,764 --> 00:17:20,483
instead of pressuring him to
accept intimacy on your terms.

456
00:17:21,434 --> 00:17:23,769
You should probably go.

457
00:17:33,391 --> 00:17:36,093
I'm Ira Flatow,
and this is <i>Science Friday.</i>

458
00:17:36,095 --> 00:17:38,195
I'd like to welcome back
Dr. Sheldon Cooper,

459
00:17:38,197 --> 00:17:40,281
who thought
he had discovered

460
00:17:40,283 --> 00:17:43,033
a new super-heavy element
only to have it disproved

461
00:17:43,035 --> 00:17:45,486
by my next guest,
Dr. Leonard Hofstadter.

462
00:17:45,488 --> 00:17:46,620
Welcome to <i>Science</i> Friday,
gentlemen.

463
00:17:46,622 --> 00:17:48,072
Thanks.
Thank you.

464
00:17:48,074 --> 00:17:50,708
Ira, if I may,
I'd like to apologize

465
00:17:50,710 --> 00:17:52,743
for my behavior last week.

466
00:17:52,745 --> 00:17:54,328
It's all right.

467
00:17:54,330 --> 00:17:57,715
Now, isn't there something
you'd like to say to me?

468
00:17:58,633 --> 00:18:00,668
No.

469
00:18:01,303 --> 00:18:03,170
Now, Dr. Hofstadter.

470
00:18:03,172 --> 00:18:04,555
Can you walk us
through the process

471
00:18:04,557 --> 00:18:06,423
you used to disprove his theory?

472
00:18:06,425 --> 00:18:09,143
Well...
I believe I can answer that.

473
00:18:09,145 --> 00:18:11,095
He asked me.

474
00:18:11,097 --> 00:18:12,313
Fine.

475
00:18:12,315 --> 00:18:13,347
As I was saying...

476
00:18:13,349 --> 00:18:14,815
You're telling it wrong.
Ira...

477
00:18:14,817 --> 00:18:16,817
to really understand
the story here,

478
00:18:16,819 --> 00:18:18,402
you have to start
at the very beginning:

479
00:18:18,404 --> 00:18:21,438
A small town in East Texas,
where a young genius named...

480
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:23,307
Sheldon...
That's right, Sheldon Cooper.

481
00:18:23,309 --> 00:18:26,577
He was bitten
by his neighbor's dog,

482
00:18:26,579 --> 00:18:28,495
leading to his first
scientific breakthrough--

483
00:18:28,497 --> 00:18:30,748
the doggie death-ray.

484
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:33,117
Which, sadly, he couldn't build

485
00:18:33,119 --> 00:18:35,986
because Santa wouldn't bring him
enriched uranium.

486
00:18:35,988 --> 00:18:38,756
I mean, I'd really like
to hear it from Dr. Hofstadter,

487
00:18:38,758 --> 00:18:40,040
if it's okay with you.

488
00:18:40,042 --> 00:18:41,992
What a surprise.

489
00:18:41,994 --> 00:18:44,678
Did-did you invite me back
just so you could ignore me?

490
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:46,513
Actually, I didn't invite you.

491
00:18:46,515 --> 00:18:47,998
You came in, you took a seat,

492
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,018
and I'm not comfortable
with confrontation.

493
00:18:52,637 --> 00:18:55,122
Sheldon, this interview
is supposed to be about me.

494
00:18:55,124 --> 00:18:57,324
Well, that seems like a snooze.

495
00:18:57,326 --> 00:19:00,094
Even for public radio.

496
00:19:00,096 --> 00:19:01,929
You know, if we did
a shot every time

497
00:19:01,931 --> 00:19:03,130
they said something
embarrassing,

498
00:19:03,132 --> 00:19:05,282
this would be one hell
of a drinking game.

499
00:19:05,284 --> 00:19:07,468
A little early
for alcohol, isn't it?

500
00:19:07,470 --> 00:19:09,353
You know, I don't just say smart
things about science.

501
00:19:09,355 --> 00:19:10,854
I also yodel.

502
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:16,827
I'll get the vodka.
