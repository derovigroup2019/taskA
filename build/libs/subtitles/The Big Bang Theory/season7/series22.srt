1
00:00:02,151 --> 00:00:05,786
Gentlemen, <i>Star Wars</i> day
is rapidly approaching.

2
00:00:05,788 --> 00:00:07,538
We should finalize our plans.

3
00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:09,606
What? That's a real thing?

4
00:00:10,358 --> 00:00:12,776
What is it, <i>Star Wars</i> Christmas?

5
00:00:12,778 --> 00:00:15,379
No. Don't be ridiculous.

6
00:00:15,381 --> 00:00:17,331
That's Wookiee Life Day.

7
00:00:17,333 --> 00:00:19,917
So, when is it?

8
00:00:19,919 --> 00:00:22,636
Uh, well, it's not
May the fifth...

9
00:00:22,638 --> 00:00:25,556
and it's not
May the third...

10
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:31,979
It's May the fourth.

11
00:00:33,331 --> 00:00:35,482
Get it?

12
00:00:35,484 --> 00:00:38,519
May the fourth
be with you?

13
00:00:39,404 --> 00:00:41,805
"May the force be with you."
Get it?

14
00:00:41,807 --> 00:00:44,575
Oh, no. This face
wasn't because I didn't get it.

15
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:49,246
? Our whole universe
was in a hot, dense state ?

16
00:00:49,248 --> 00:00:52,583
? Then nearly 14 billion years
ago expansion started... Wait! ?

17
00:00:52,585 --> 00:00:54,251
? The Earth began to cool

18
00:00:54,253 --> 00:00:57,288
? The autotrophs began to drool,
Neanderthals developed tools ?

19
00:00:57,290 --> 00:00:59,323
? We built the Wall
? <i>We built the pyramids</i> ?

20
00:00:59,325 --> 00:01:02,142
? Math, Science, History,
unraveling the mystery ?

21
00:01:02,144 --> 00:01:03,927
? That all started
with a big bang ?

22
00:01:03,929 --> 00:01:05,606
? <i>Bang!</i> ?

23
00:01:05,607 --> 00:01:09,607

25
00:01:15,653 --> 00:01:16,752
Come in.

26
00:01:18,621 --> 00:01:20,589
Hey, you got a second?

27
00:01:20,591 --> 00:01:21,740
Yes.

28
00:01:21,742 --> 00:01:23,075
Actually, I'm glad you're here.

29
00:01:23,077 --> 00:01:26,662
I-I'm working on the
<i>Star Wars</i> Day schedule.

30
00:01:26,664 --> 00:01:30,065
Now, I have a window built in
after <i>Phantom Menace,</i>

31
00:01:30,067 --> 00:01:32,017
for complaining, but...

32
00:01:33,970 --> 00:01:37,106
...I'm worried an hour
won't be enough time.

33
00:01:39,592 --> 00:01:42,861
Sheldon, I-I've got
some bad news.

34
00:01:42,863 --> 00:01:43,979
What is it

35
00:01:43,981 --> 00:01:46,782
I just read online

36
00:01:46,784 --> 00:01:49,434
that Arthur Jeffries
passed away.

37
00:01:51,271 --> 00:01:53,305
Professor Proton is dead?

38
00:01:54,157 --> 00:01:56,158
Sorry, buddy.

39
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:04,074

40
00:02:06,336 --> 00:02:08,554
What are you doing?

41
00:02:08,556 --> 00:02:11,773
Comforting you?

42
00:02:11,775 --> 00:02:14,092
Y-Your heart might be
in the right place,

43
00:02:14,094 --> 00:02:16,345
but your head, chest and
arms certainly aren't.

44
00:02:18,765 --> 00:02:20,732
Anyway, the-the
funeral's on Sunday.

45
00:02:20,734 --> 00:02:23,352
But, that's
<i>Star Wars</i> Day.

46
00:02:23,354 --> 00:02:25,470
Yeah... um...

47
00:02:25,472 --> 00:02:27,940
of all the things about this
that are sad,

48
00:02:27,942 --> 00:02:30,809
that might not be number one.

49
00:02:32,245 --> 00:02:34,446
You okay?
I know he meant a lot to you.

50
00:02:34,448 --> 00:02:36,481
I'm fine.

51
00:02:36,483 --> 00:02:39,317
Okay.

52
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:44,590
Yet he cried when they changed
the Raisin Bran box.

53
00:02:46,593 --> 00:02:48,577
This, uh,
this is something interesting

54
00:02:48,579 --> 00:02:50,045
boys and girls.

55
00:02:50,047 --> 00:02:53,749
After an owl eats,
he spits up part of his meal,

56
00:02:53,751 --> 00:02:57,452
that he can't digest,
in the form of a pellet.

57
00:03:00,156 --> 00:03:01,757
Is-Isn't that a hoot?

58
00:03:06,429 --> 00:03:10,866
We'll be right back
after I fire my writers.

59
00:03:11,969 --> 00:03:14,803
Oh, shut up.

60
00:03:14,805 --> 00:03:17,039
Watching your
old friend?

61
00:03:17,041 --> 00:03:19,074
Hmm. Yes.

62
00:03:19,076 --> 00:03:20,325
Look at him, Amy.

63
00:03:20,327 --> 00:03:21,843
It's such a shame.

64
00:03:21,845 --> 00:03:24,546
Struck down
in the prime of my life.

65
00:03:26,365 --> 00:03:29,534
Do you want me to go to
the funeral with you?

66
00:03:29,536 --> 00:03:31,386
Oh, I'm not going
to the funeral.

67
00:03:31,388 --> 00:03:32,804
Why not?

68
00:03:32,806 --> 00:03:35,040
All those people
blowing their noses.

69
00:03:35,042 --> 00:03:39,061
You can't tell the sick
from the sad. Mm.

70
00:03:39,063 --> 00:03:43,181
I'll be at home celebrating
<i>Star Wars</i> Day, as planned.

71
00:03:43,183 --> 00:03:45,400
Are you sure you don't
want to go say good-bye?

72
00:03:45,402 --> 00:03:51,089
Amy, mourning the inevitable
is a complete waste of time.

73
00:03:51,091 --> 00:03:53,742
And watching a bunch
of goofy space movies

74
00:03:53,744 --> 00:03:55,994
you've seen hundreds
of times isn't?

75
00:03:55,996 --> 00:03:58,597
If we were in
a physical relationship,

76
00:03:58,599 --> 00:04:00,282
you just lost sex tonight.

77
00:04:03,536 --> 00:04:05,003
Hey, guys.

78
00:04:05,005 --> 00:04:08,123
Hey, Penny.
Happy <i>Star Wars</i> Day.

79
00:04:09,592 --> 00:04:11,593
Okay.

80
00:04:11,595 --> 00:04:13,578
Can I make you
breakfast?

81
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:17,766
Admiral Ackbar's Snack Bar
is open for business.

82
00:04:17,768 --> 00:04:20,085
No, thanks. Leonard and I
are just going to the funeral.

83
00:04:20,087 --> 00:04:22,253
You sure. Not even coffee?

84
00:04:22,255 --> 00:04:24,422
We have R2-Decaf.

85
00:04:25,108 --> 00:04:28,310
Maybe a nice Cafe Au Leia?

86
00:04:29,445 --> 00:04:31,096
And if you're not
in the mood for coffee,

87
00:04:31,098 --> 00:04:33,649
I can always make you
a Chai Tea-3PO.

88
00:04:33,651 --> 00:04:37,602
Oh, I get it-- like C-3PO.

89
00:04:37,604 --> 00:04:39,571
What happened to me?

90
00:04:39,573 --> 00:04:42,440
Hey, uh, Sheldon,
you want anything?

91
00:04:42,442 --> 00:04:43,992
Uh, no, thank you.

92
00:04:43,994 --> 00:04:45,443
You're being so quiet.

93
00:04:45,445 --> 00:04:49,197
Are you upset
or are you just rebooting?

94
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:50,966
I'm fine.

95
00:04:50,968 --> 00:04:52,334
Sweetie, are you sure

96
00:04:52,336 --> 00:04:54,619
you don't want to
come with us to the funeral?

97
00:04:54,621 --> 00:04:56,838
Oh, I appreciate the
offer, but Arthur is gone

98
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:59,091
and there's nothing
I can do about it.

99
00:04:59,093 --> 00:05:01,643
When Darth Vader
struck down Obi-Wan,

100
00:05:01,645 --> 00:05:04,346
did Luke cry like a baby
and go to his funeral?

101
00:05:04,348 --> 00:05:05,347
No.

102
00:05:05,349 --> 00:05:06,565
He blew up the Death Star.

103
00:05:06,567 --> 00:05:08,317
Why do I know this?!

104
00:05:09,736 --> 00:05:11,803
Arthur Jeffries
was a scientist.

105
00:05:11,805 --> 00:05:13,271
I'm sure he didn't care about

106
00:05:13,273 --> 00:05:15,640
silly superstitions
like funerals.

107
00:05:15,642 --> 00:05:18,076
You know, if he were here,
I think he'd say,

108
00:05:18,078 --> 00:05:19,945
"Enjoy <i>Star Wars</i> Day."

109
00:05:19,947 --> 00:05:23,081
He was 84;
he'd say, "Where's my pudding?"

110
00:05:24,667 --> 00:05:27,069
Before you go, at least
let me pack you some

111
00:05:27,071 --> 00:05:30,088
Attack of the Scones
for the road.

112
00:05:30,090 --> 00:05:32,758
Oh, like <i>Attack</i>
<i>of the Clones.</i>

113
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:34,926
We are leaving
right now.

114
00:05:36,796 --> 00:05:39,197
Arthur passing away
was harder on Sheldon

115
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:40,849
than he's ready to admit.

116
00:05:40,851 --> 00:05:42,517
Really hoping
this will cheer him up.

117
00:05:42,519 --> 00:05:43,685
Me, too.

118
00:05:43,687 --> 00:05:45,053
Although, it
might've been

119
00:05:45,055 --> 00:05:47,439
thoughtless of us to
bake a Death Star cake.

120
00:05:48,641 --> 00:05:51,176
No, it combines two of
Sheldon's favorite things:

121
00:05:51,178 --> 00:05:52,644
chocolate chips

122
00:05:52,646 --> 00:05:56,114
and the ability to destroy a
planet at the push of a button.

123
00:05:56,116 --> 00:05:59,151
Well, anyway, it'll be a
nice surprise for the boys.

124
00:05:59,153 --> 00:06:01,570
And Howie doesn't think I
take his interests seriously,

125
00:06:01,572 --> 00:06:04,289
so hopefully this will keep
him fooled for a while.

126
00:06:04,291 --> 00:06:08,326
Okay, let's get the fondant
and start decorating.

127
00:06:08,328 --> 00:06:09,795
This is pretty cool.

128
00:06:09,797 --> 00:06:12,381
You don't see too many
spherical cakes.

129
00:06:15,118 --> 00:06:17,819
I wonder why that is.

130
00:06:24,093 --> 00:06:26,211
I have a confession to make.
Hmm?

131
00:06:26,213 --> 00:06:28,313
I've never been
to a funeral before.

132
00:06:28,315 --> 00:06:29,314
Really?

133
00:06:29,316 --> 00:06:31,216
I just never knew
anyone that died.

134
00:06:31,218 --> 00:06:33,652
I had a pet pig
when I was a kid.

135
00:06:33,654 --> 00:06:36,104
I mean, when he died,
we didn't have a funeral,

136
00:06:36,106 --> 00:06:38,190
we had a barbecue.

137
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:43,662
Yeah, we won't be
eating Arthur tonight.

138
00:06:46,565 --> 00:06:50,401
I didn't know him very well,
but I still really liked him.

139
00:06:50,403 --> 00:06:53,538
It's weird that he's...
just gone.

140
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:55,090
I know.

141
00:06:55,092 --> 00:06:57,592
I feel like I want to cry.

142
00:06:57,594 --> 00:06:59,577
Oh... that's-that's fine.

143
00:06:59,579 --> 00:07:01,096
Go ahead.

144
00:07:06,219 --> 00:07:07,719
I can't do it
with you staring at me.

145
00:07:07,721 --> 00:07:09,554
Sorry.

146
00:07:13,059 --> 00:07:15,093
No, I'm dry.

147
00:07:15,095 --> 00:07:17,646
You're a big crybaby--
you start, I'll join in.

148
00:07:18,731 --> 00:07:20,649
I am not a crybaby.

149
00:07:20,651 --> 00:07:21,933
<i>Toy Story 3?</i>

150
00:07:21,935 --> 00:07:25,237
The toys were holding hands
in a furnace!

151
00:07:30,159 --> 00:07:32,944
Look, A-Arthur lived
a full life.

152
00:07:32,946 --> 00:07:36,298
And he inspired
a lot of people.

153
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:39,251
Sure, he-he was
my childhood hero,

154
00:07:39,253 --> 00:07:42,804
but... the fact that
I got to work with him,

155
00:07:42,806 --> 00:07:45,590
side by side,
before he...

156
00:07:45,592 --> 00:07:48,459
died was...

157
00:07:48,461 --> 00:07:51,596
it was... it was a gift.

158
00:07:51,598 --> 00:07:54,149
It was a gift.

159
00:07:54,151 --> 00:07:56,485
Thank you for being
the emotional one

160
00:07:56,487 --> 00:07:58,520
in this relationship.

161
00:07:58,522 --> 00:08:01,139
I got your back.

162
00:08:01,141 --> 00:08:02,607
Yeah.

163
00:08:04,777 --> 00:08:06,945
Okay, here we go.

164
00:08:06,947 --> 00:08:09,247
<i>Episode I--</i>
<i>The Phantom Menace.</i>

165
00:08:10,417 --> 00:08:11,816
Let's get this over with.

166
00:08:11,818 --> 00:08:13,952
Since we all agree
<i>Episode I</i> isn't our favorite,

167
00:08:13,954 --> 00:08:15,370
maybe we just skip it this time.

168
00:08:15,372 --> 00:08:17,455
Yeah, Howard,
I think you of all people

169
00:08:17,457 --> 00:08:18,823
should avoid espousing
the principle

170
00:08:18,825 --> 00:08:20,625
that if something
is not our favorite

171
00:08:20,627 --> 00:08:22,511
we should just get rid of it.

172
00:08:25,431 --> 00:08:28,333
You know, I heard this way
of watching the movies

173
00:08:28,335 --> 00:08:31,636
called the Machete Order, where
you watch <i>Episodes IV</i> and <i>V,</i>

174
00:08:31,638 --> 00:08:33,388
then skip <i>Episode I,</i>

175
00:08:33,390 --> 00:08:35,774
watch <i>II</i> and <i>III</i>
as a flashback,

176
00:08:35,776 --> 00:08:37,309
and then finish with <i>VI.</i>

177
00:08:37,311 --> 00:08:39,444
Okay, so you'd lose
most of Jar Jar,

178
00:08:39,446 --> 00:08:42,280
all the trade route talk,
and the boring senate hearings,

179
00:08:42,282 --> 00:08:45,567
which are like watching C-SPAN
with monsters.

180
00:08:46,452 --> 00:08:48,169
Get rid of the
trade route part?

181
00:08:48,171 --> 00:08:50,405
Then how would Palpatine
get Chancellor Valorum

182
00:08:50,407 --> 00:08:51,806
kicked out of office?

183
00:08:51,808 --> 00:08:52,857
Eh.

184
00:08:52,859 --> 00:08:54,910
How would he get
himself elected? How?

185
00:08:54,912 --> 00:08:56,645
Can we get through one holiday

186
00:08:56,647 --> 00:08:59,831
without you saying
something ridiculous?

187
00:08:59,833 --> 00:09:01,132
It was just a suggestion.

188
00:09:01,134 --> 00:09:03,418
Well, you know what else
was just a suggestion?

189
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:05,420
"Why don't we change
the Raisin Bran box?"

190
00:09:05,422 --> 00:09:08,340
Hmm? And you know
who got hurt by that?

191
00:09:08,342 --> 00:09:10,258
Every single person
who eats breakfast!

192
00:09:13,613 --> 00:09:15,013
Wow.

193
00:09:15,015 --> 00:09:16,064
I think he's taking

194
00:09:16,066 --> 00:09:18,099
this Professor Proton thing
pretty hard.

195
00:09:18,101 --> 00:09:21,486
Should we try to console him?

196
00:09:21,488 --> 00:09:24,773
Or... should we
respect his privacy

197
00:09:24,775 --> 00:09:27,058
in this moment of grief?

198
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:29,744
By staying here
and watching the movie.

199
00:09:29,746 --> 00:09:32,247
That's what
good friends would do!

200
00:09:42,263 --> 00:09:43,679
Well, at least
without Sheldon here,

201
00:09:43,681 --> 00:09:46,049
we got to start
with <i>Episode IV.</i>

202
00:09:46,051 --> 00:09:47,433
Mm, true.

203
00:09:50,372 --> 00:09:51,871
I do feel guilty about him.

204
00:09:51,873 --> 00:09:52,922
Me, too.

205
00:09:52,924 --> 00:09:53,973
Maybe we should see
how he's doing.

206
00:09:53,975 --> 00:09:55,007
Yeah.

207
00:09:55,009 --> 00:09:56,676
But after the cantina scene.
Obviously.

208
00:10:03,567 --> 00:10:05,501
Look at Arthur...

209
00:10:05,503 --> 00:10:08,604
cracking up at a joke
I told him.

210
00:10:11,408 --> 00:10:14,077
I'll never hear
that laugh again.

211
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:16,712
You never
heard it <i>that</i> time.

212
00:10:21,301 --> 00:10:22,635
Arthur!

213
00:10:22,637 --> 00:10:24,804
I thought you were dead.

214
00:10:24,806 --> 00:10:26,255
I am.

215
00:10:26,257 --> 00:10:29,458
Oh, it-it's fantastic.

216
00:10:30,227 --> 00:10:32,311
I mean, this is the longest

217
00:10:32,313 --> 00:10:36,632
that I've gone without
running into a men's room

218
00:10:36,634 --> 00:10:39,602
in-in years.

219
00:10:40,437 --> 00:10:42,438
Why are you here?

220
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:44,690
I-I don't know.
I was...

221
00:10:44,692 --> 00:10:49,061
I was hoping I was going
to haunt my ex-wife.

222
00:10:49,863 --> 00:10:52,748
I know why.

223
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:54,984
You've come
to me because

224
00:10:54,986 --> 00:10:58,504
you're my Obi-Wan.

225
00:10:58,506 --> 00:11:01,340
I'm-I'm not...
I'm not familiar with that.

226
00:11:01,342 --> 00:11:04,460
Is... is-is that an...

227
00:11:04,462 --> 00:11:07,280
an Internet?

228
00:11:09,116 --> 00:11:10,600
Wow.

229
00:11:10,602 --> 00:11:13,603
Uh, you're dead,
so I'm going to let that slide.

230
00:11:14,838 --> 00:11:18,357
Obi-Wan Kenobi is a character
from <i>Star Wars.</i>

231
00:11:18,359 --> 00:11:19,725
After his
physical demise,

232
00:11:19,727 --> 00:11:24,297
he comes to Luke Skywalker
as his mentor in spirit form.

233
00:11:24,299 --> 00:11:27,283
Well, that...
that clears that up.

234
00:11:27,285 --> 00:11:29,485
Yeah.

235
00:11:30,270 --> 00:11:32,972
You must be here
to give me advice.

236
00:11:38,295 --> 00:11:41,447
Well, this... this is weird.

237
00:11:42,199 --> 00:11:44,700
Most-most of my robes open in...

238
00:11:44,702 --> 00:11:46,869
in the back.

239
00:11:49,139 --> 00:11:51,707
Those are your Jedi robes.

240
00:11:52,576 --> 00:11:55,428
Oh, wait. What...?

241
00:11:55,430 --> 00:11:58,047
What-what... what is this?

242
00:11:58,983 --> 00:12:00,433
Oh! Be careful
with that!

243
00:12:00,435 --> 00:12:02,852
Whoa!

244
00:12:09,893 --> 00:12:11,577
Whoa!

245
00:12:13,231 --> 00:12:16,082
Oh, neato.

246
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:24,790
I'm, uh... I'm going
to need a Band-Aid.

247
00:12:27,577 --> 00:12:30,246
So...

248
00:12:30,248 --> 00:12:32,131
what did you think
of your first funeral?

249
00:12:32,133 --> 00:12:36,585
Well, I don't want to be a jerk,
but it was kind of a bummer.

250
00:12:36,587 --> 00:12:39,939
Yeah, well, when I die,
you can rent a bounce house.

251
00:12:39,941 --> 00:12:42,225
You think about dying?

252
00:12:42,227 --> 00:12:46,262
Mm. Well, I think more about
if I'd have any regrets.

253
00:12:46,264 --> 00:12:47,647
What would you regret?

254
00:12:47,649 --> 00:12:50,700
Mm, you know,
that I didn't travel more,

255
00:12:50,702 --> 00:12:53,452
take more risks,
learn another language.

256
00:12:53,454 --> 00:12:56,072
You know Klingon.

257
00:12:56,074 --> 00:12:57,623
That's true.

258
00:12:57,625 --> 00:12:59,792
No, I meant that
as a regret.

259
00:13:03,947 --> 00:13:05,550
I just thought of one more.

260
00:13:05,551 --> 00:13:07,384
What's that?

261
00:13:07,386 --> 00:13:10,804
I regret not saying "yes"
when you asked me to marry you.

262
00:13:12,674 --> 00:13:14,892
Well, it just wasn't
the right time.

263
00:13:14,894 --> 00:13:16,844
Yeah.

264
00:13:16,846 --> 00:13:18,679
And this is also
not the right time.

265
00:13:18,681 --> 00:13:20,564
Do not propose.

266
00:13:20,566 --> 00:13:22,349
What?

267
00:13:22,351 --> 00:13:24,735
I know that face.
That's your propose face.

268
00:13:24,737 --> 00:13:26,767
I was not gonna propose.
It's already two to one.

269
00:13:26,768 --> 00:13:27,818
What's two to one?

270
00:13:27,843 --> 00:13:29,569
I proposed twice,
you proposed once. Two to one.

271
00:13:29,570 --> 00:13:31,403
Oh, my... It's
not a contest.

272
00:13:31,405 --> 00:13:32,788
I don't know what
you're upset about.

273
00:13:32,790 --> 00:13:35,106
I'm the one who's losing.
Okay.

274
00:13:35,108 --> 00:13:36,941
Fine. Would you feel
better if I propose

275
00:13:36,943 --> 00:13:38,660
so you could turn
me down again?

276
00:13:38,662 --> 00:13:40,045
Yeah, I think I would.

277
00:13:40,047 --> 00:13:42,047
Okay. Leonard,
will you marry me?

278
00:13:42,049 --> 00:13:44,666
Hmm.

279
00:13:44,668 --> 00:13:45,967
No, don't you dare.

280
00:13:45,969 --> 00:13:48,470
You reject me right
now and tie things up.

281
00:13:50,423 --> 00:13:52,557
It's just such a big decision.

282
00:13:52,559 --> 00:13:54,676
I don't want
to have any regrets.

283
00:13:57,263 --> 00:13:59,931
Did you ever watch
Professor Proton

284
00:13:59,933 --> 00:14:01,149
when you were a kid?

285
00:14:01,151 --> 00:14:02,467
No.

286
00:14:02,469 --> 00:14:03,802
My dad controlled the TV,

287
00:14:03,804 --> 00:14:05,637
so unless someone
was a Texas Ranger,

288
00:14:05,639 --> 00:14:07,939
Jake or the Fatman,
we didn't see it.

289
00:14:09,158 --> 00:14:11,777
I never watched him, either,
but he seems to be the reason

290
00:14:11,779 --> 00:14:13,445
that Sheldon got interested
in science.

291
00:14:13,447 --> 00:14:14,946
Not me. I got
into science

292
00:14:14,948 --> 00:14:17,148
'cause I was always the
smallest kid in school,

293
00:14:17,150 --> 00:14:19,167
so I thought if I
became a scientist,

294
00:14:19,169 --> 00:14:21,920
I could invent a formula
that made me taller.

295
00:14:21,922 --> 00:14:23,672
That's cute.

296
00:14:23,674 --> 00:14:25,957
Yeah, I thought it was
working for a while,

297
00:14:25,959 --> 00:14:27,325
but then I found out

298
00:14:27,327 --> 00:14:31,129
my brother was just lowering the
pencil marks on the door frame.

299
00:14:31,131 --> 00:14:32,214
How about you?

300
00:14:32,216 --> 00:14:34,316
Oh, I guess
it must have been

301
00:14:34,318 --> 00:14:37,269
back when I was
in the Girl Sprouts.

302
00:14:37,271 --> 00:14:39,671
Girl <i>Sprouts?</i>

303
00:14:39,673 --> 00:14:42,474
My mom made it up as an
alternative to the Girl Scouts.

304
00:14:42,476 --> 00:14:44,559
She didn't want me
selling cookies

305
00:14:44,561 --> 00:14:47,112
on some street corner
"like a whore."

306
00:14:51,016 --> 00:14:53,318
How did that get
you into science?

307
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:54,953
Oh, I went to the library

308
00:14:54,955 --> 00:14:58,206
and took out a book on biology
to see what whores did.

309
00:15:01,544 --> 00:15:05,029
On the one hand,
if I say yes...

310
00:15:05,031 --> 00:15:07,048
This isn't funny anymore.

311
00:15:07,050 --> 00:15:08,717
Just say no
so we're done with this.

312
00:15:08,719 --> 00:15:10,535
Will you marry me or not?

313
00:15:10,537 --> 00:15:14,105
Ooh, interesting. Did you just
propose to me again?

314
00:15:14,107 --> 00:15:16,374
No.
Really?

315
00:15:16,376 --> 00:15:18,310
Because I just heard,
"Will you marry me?"

316
00:15:18,312 --> 00:15:21,479
That's two
proposals, one day.

317
00:15:21,481 --> 00:15:24,048
Sounds like someone wants
to spend the rest of her life

318
00:15:24,050 --> 00:15:26,885
telling people how to spell
the name Hofstadter.

319
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:30,939
You know what? Fine.
Do whatever you want.

320
00:15:30,941 --> 00:15:32,774
Hey.

321
00:15:32,776 --> 00:15:34,910
Penny, don't get upset.

322
00:15:34,912 --> 00:15:37,112
Here.

323
00:15:37,114 --> 00:15:41,082
I love you, but, no,
I will not marry you.

324
00:15:41,084 --> 00:15:42,701
Thank you.

325
00:15:42,703 --> 00:15:44,068
Now, about that
second proposal.

326
00:15:44,070 --> 00:15:46,788
On the one hand...

327
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:00,018
Where... where... where are we?

328
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:04,189
This is the
swampland of Dagobah.

329
00:16:04,191 --> 00:16:07,058
It's where Luke was trained
in the ways of the Jedi.

330
00:16:07,060 --> 00:16:08,310
Oh.

331
00:16:08,312 --> 00:16:11,563
Too bad.
I thought it was Florida.

332
00:16:18,036 --> 00:16:22,240
When Obi-Wan came to Luke
on this very spot,

333
00:16:22,242 --> 00:16:25,609
he gave him all sorts
of helpful advice.

334
00:16:25,611 --> 00:16:28,112
So, um...

335
00:16:28,114 --> 00:16:31,032
what do you got for me?

336
00:16:31,034 --> 00:16:34,252
Um...

337
00:16:34,254 --> 00:16:36,454
always...

338
00:16:36,456 --> 00:16:38,740
get... get a prenup.

339
00:16:42,794 --> 00:16:44,729
That's it?

340
00:16:44,731 --> 00:16:48,483
I thought there'd be more
of a reason why you're here.

341
00:16:48,485 --> 00:16:52,019
Well, why-why do <i>you</i> think
I'm here?

342
00:16:52,021 --> 00:16:55,606
I suppose it has something to do
with your recent passing.

343
00:16:55,608 --> 00:16:58,576
Is-is this the...
the first time

344
00:16:58,578 --> 00:17:01,145
you've lost, you know,
someone close to you?

345
00:17:01,147 --> 00:17:03,281
Oh, no. No.

346
00:17:03,283 --> 00:17:06,701
I've already had to say good-bye
to 11 Dr. Whos.

347
00:17:10,005 --> 00:17:13,040
Yeah, I've-I've outlived
a few of my doctors, too.

348
00:17:15,794 --> 00:17:19,013
Of course, my grandfather
died when I was five.

349
00:17:19,015 --> 00:17:21,832
My father died when I was 14.

350
00:17:21,834 --> 00:17:24,552
I'm... I'm sorry about that.

351
00:17:24,554 --> 00:17:26,721
And now you're gone, too.

352
00:17:28,123 --> 00:17:31,359
It's like all the men I've
looked up to have gone away.

353
00:17:32,311 --> 00:17:34,395
Well, you know, it's...

354
00:17:34,397 --> 00:17:37,899
it's okay to...
to be sad about them.

355
00:17:37,901 --> 00:17:42,737
Just... just make sure,
you know, you appreciate

356
00:17:42,739 --> 00:17:45,706
those who... who are
still there for you.

357
00:17:45,708 --> 00:17:49,577
But I do appreciate them.

358
00:17:49,579 --> 00:17:52,580
Well, then,

359
00:17:52,582 --> 00:17:55,550
what am I doing in a swamp...

360
00:18:00,422 --> 00:18:03,391
...dressed like Friar Tuck?

361
00:18:08,931 --> 00:18:11,582
Appreciate them, Sheldon.

362
00:18:14,387 --> 00:18:16,220
Hey, buddy.

363
00:18:16,222 --> 00:18:18,322
Heard you're having a rough day.
You all right?

364
00:18:18,324 --> 00:18:20,074
I'm okay.

365
00:18:20,943 --> 00:18:23,227
How was the funeral?

366
00:18:24,062 --> 00:18:26,914
It was nice, you know.

367
00:18:26,916 --> 00:18:29,083
A lot of people showed up,

368
00:18:29,085 --> 00:18:32,069
told some great stories
about him.

369
00:18:32,071 --> 00:18:35,423
Did you know that Arthur's son
is a high school sci...?

370
00:18:51,256 --> 00:18:53,774
Hey, the guys are about
to start <i>Jedi.</i>

371
00:18:53,776 --> 00:18:55,109
You want to go watch?

372
00:18:55,111 --> 00:18:56,760
I do.

373
00:18:58,113 --> 00:19:01,649
After I make them go back and
watch one through five first.

374
00:19:04,202 --> 00:19:06,804
Sheldon, that-that'll
take us all night.

375
00:19:06,806 --> 00:19:08,239
That's true.

376
00:19:08,241 --> 00:19:10,625
Oh, it's a good thing
I had a nap.

377
00:19:16,983 --> 00:19:18,883
Boy, some of the
physical comedy

378
00:19:18,885 --> 00:19:21,886
with Jar Jar is a
little tough to watch.

379
00:19:23,672 --> 00:19:26,991
At least they toned him down
in the second one.

380
00:19:26,993 --> 00:19:29,510
Yeah, he is
pretty stupid.

381
00:19:32,281 --> 00:19:34,815
Hey, we can say it.
You can't.

382
00:19:36,151 --> 00:19:37,685
Hey, guys.

383
00:19:37,687 --> 00:19:39,236
Happy <i>Star Wars</i> Day!

384
00:19:39,238 --> 00:19:41,072
Wow!

385
00:19:41,074 --> 00:19:43,441
- A Death Star cake!
- Yeah.

386
00:19:43,443 --> 00:19:44,742
We were hoping
it might cheer you up.

387
00:19:44,744 --> 00:19:45,660
And even though

388
00:19:45,662 --> 00:19:46,944
it meant we had to
miss the movies,

389
00:19:46,946 --> 00:19:48,195
we could still be
part of the fun.

390
00:19:48,197 --> 00:19:49,196
Well, you didn't
miss anything.

391
00:19:49,198 --> 00:19:50,314
We just started over.

392
00:19:50,316 --> 00:19:52,500
Son of a bitch.

393
00:20:11,654 --> 00:20:13,171
You're back.

394
00:20:13,172 --> 00:20:15,339
Yeah, apparently, um,

395
00:20:15,341 --> 00:20:18,142
I'm here whenever...
when-whenever you need me.

396
00:20:18,144 --> 00:20:19,977
That's nice.

397
00:20:19,979 --> 00:20:22,897
May-Maybe for you.

398
00:20:25,150 --> 00:20:27,702
Why do I need you now?

399
00:20:27,704 --> 00:20:30,154
Well, as near as I could tell,

400
00:20:30,156 --> 00:20:33,541
you-you fell asleep
watching <i>Star Wars,</i>

401
00:20:33,543 --> 00:20:37,244
and now you're-you're dreaming
you're watching <i>Star Wars.</i>

402
00:20:37,246 --> 00:20:39,013
So?

403
00:20:39,015 --> 00:20:42,032
I mean, don't-don't you see
a problem there?

404
00:20:42,034 --> 00:20:43,367
I mean, how-how

405
00:20:43,369 --> 00:20:46,704
you're spending
your limited time on Earth?

406
00:20:48,451 --> 00:20:50,617
Not at all.

407
00:20:50,619 --> 00:20:53,054
Okay, good luck to you.
