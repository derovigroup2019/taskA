1
00:00:02,443 --> 00:00:04,582
I got to tell you, the more
I read about the primordial

2
00:00:04,583 --> 00:00:07,584
gravity wave discovery,
the more excited I get.

3
00:00:07,586 --> 00:00:09,719
I know. Being an
astrophysicist right now

4
00:00:09,721 --> 00:00:11,221
is like being a rock star.

5
00:00:11,223 --> 00:00:13,423
Only without the sex.

6
00:00:13,425 --> 00:00:16,392
Yeah, literally, none of it.

7
00:00:17,228 --> 00:00:19,462
What do you think
about it, Sheldon?

8
00:00:19,464 --> 00:00:21,097
Meh.

9
00:00:21,099 --> 00:00:23,032
Are you kidding me?

10
00:00:23,034 --> 00:00:25,301
This may be the biggest
scientific breakthrough

11
00:00:25,303 --> 00:00:27,070
of our lifetime. How can you,

12
00:00:27,072 --> 00:00:28,905
as a theoretical
physicist,

13
00:00:28,907 --> 00:00:30,206
not care about this?

14
00:00:30,208 --> 00:00:32,142
Maybe it's because
I'm not an elitist.

15
00:00:32,144 --> 00:00:33,376
What I'd like to know is:

16
00:00:33,378 --> 00:00:35,245
How does this gravity wave
breakthrough

17
00:00:35,247 --> 00:00:36,813
help the man on the street?

18
00:00:36,815 --> 00:00:38,281
You know?
Wh-Who's looking out

19
00:00:38,283 --> 00:00:41,885
for Joe Six-Pack and all
his quantum physics concerns?

20
00:00:41,887 --> 00:00:44,687
Oh, my God,
you're jealous.

21
00:00:44,689 --> 00:00:46,756
Why would I be jealous?

22
00:00:46,758 --> 00:00:49,125
Oh, I don't know. Maybe because
the origin of the universe

23
00:00:49,127 --> 00:00:50,360
just got proven,

24
00:00:50,362 --> 00:00:52,028
the Higgs field
just got proven

25
00:00:52,030 --> 00:00:53,429
and you've been working
on string theory

26
00:00:53,431 --> 00:01:01,304
for the last 20 years and
you're no closer to proving it

27
00:01:01,306 --> 00:01:04,207
We happen to live
in a golden age of television.

28
00:01:05,309 --> 00:01:06,476
Excuse me,
fellas.

29
00:01:07,813 --> 00:01:09,779
Sorry for eavesdropping,
but there actually was

30
00:01:09,781 --> 00:01:11,381
some big string theory news
today

31
00:01:11,383 --> 00:01:12,916
out of the Hadron Collider.

32
00:01:12,918 --> 00:01:15,785
Really? Did they find evidence
to support extra dimensions

33
00:01:15,787 --> 00:01:17,287
or supersymmetry?

34
00:01:17,289 --> 00:01:20,290
No, but they did find evidence
that you'll believe anything.

35
00:01:22,359 --> 00:01:24,661
Why would you do that?

36
00:01:24,663 --> 00:01:26,663
You're a string theorist
as well.

37
00:01:26,665 --> 00:01:29,399
Incorrect.
I am a string pragmatist.

38
00:01:29,401 --> 00:01:32,035
I say I'm gonna prove something
that cannot be proved,

39
00:01:32,037 --> 00:01:33,469
I apply for grant money,

40
00:01:33,471 --> 00:01:36,072
and then I spend it
on liquor and broads.

41
00:01:37,007 --> 00:01:38,875
Later.

42
00:01:40,778 --> 00:01:43,012
Do you think he's right?

43
00:01:43,014 --> 00:01:47,483
Am I wasting my life on a theory
that can never be proven?

44
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:53,857
Maybe. But how great
is <i>Game of Thrones?</i>

45
00:01:53,859 --> 00:01:57,493
? Our whole universe
was in a hot, dense state ?

46
00:01:57,495 --> 00:02:00,830
? Then nearly 14 billion years
ago expansion started... Wait! ?

47
00:02:00,832 --> 00:02:02,398
? The Earth began to cool

48
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:04,934
? The autotrophs began to drool,
Neanderthals developed tools ?

49
00:02:04,936 --> 00:02:07,604
? We built the Wall
? <i>We built the pyramids</i> ?

50
00:02:07,606 --> 00:02:10,273
? Math, Science, History,
unraveling the mystery ?

51
00:02:10,275 --> 00:02:12,175
? That all started
with a big bang ?

52
00:02:12,177 --> 00:02:14,143
? <i>Bang!</i> ?

53
00:02:14,144 --> 00:02:18,144

55
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:26,381
Hey, you're up early.

56
00:02:26,383 --> 00:02:28,650
I couldn't sleep.

57
00:02:28,652 --> 00:02:32,720
I told you those <i>Walking Dead</i>
pillowcases were a bad idea.

58
00:02:32,722 --> 00:02:34,789
No, that's not it.

59
00:02:34,791 --> 00:02:36,391
Is something bothering you?

60
00:02:36,393 --> 00:02:39,327
Yes, but you wouldn't
understand.

61
00:02:39,329 --> 00:02:41,696
Oh, come on, try me.

62
00:02:42,564 --> 00:02:44,365
All right.

63
00:02:45,501 --> 00:02:49,170
I've devoted the prime
of my life to string theory

64
00:02:49,172 --> 00:02:51,205
and its quest
for the compactification

65
00:02:51,207 --> 00:02:52,840
of extra dimensions.

66
00:02:52,842 --> 00:02:56,611
I've got nothing to show for it,
and I feel like a fool.

67
00:02:57,479 --> 00:02:59,080
Okay. I get it.

68
00:02:59,082 --> 00:03:01,849
I mean, not all the jibberjabber
in the middle, but...

69
00:03:02,851 --> 00:03:04,218
I know what it's like

70
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:05,787
to put your heart and soul
into something

71
00:03:05,789 --> 00:03:07,322
and get nothing out of it.

72
00:03:07,324 --> 00:03:09,657
You mean your acting career?

73
00:03:10,492 --> 00:03:12,393
No.

74
00:03:12,395 --> 00:03:14,462
Your relationship with Leonard?

75
00:03:15,297 --> 00:03:16,931
No.

76
00:03:16,933 --> 00:03:18,566
Your failed attempt
to go back to college?

77
00:03:18,568 --> 00:03:20,068
No!

78
00:03:20,070 --> 00:03:21,135
I'm saying you

79
00:03:21,137 --> 00:03:22,770
and string theory sound
like a relationship,

80
00:03:22,772 --> 00:03:24,872
and I know what it's like
to be in one

81
00:03:24,874 --> 00:03:27,342
and realize it's never gonna
turn out the way you want.

82
00:03:28,277 --> 00:03:30,478
I said Leonard; you said no.

83
00:03:31,347 --> 00:03:33,548
I'm talking about other guys.

84
00:03:33,550 --> 00:03:34,916
Okay.

85
00:03:34,918 --> 00:03:37,518
Well, what do you do?

86
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:39,854
You have to have the courage
to end the relationship.

87
00:03:39,856 --> 00:03:43,091
You know? Break it off,
shake hands, walk away.

88
00:03:44,828 --> 00:03:47,095
I don't know if I can do that.

89
00:03:47,097 --> 00:03:48,629
I know it's hard, honey,
but in the end,

90
00:03:48,631 --> 00:03:49,664
that's how you grow.

91
00:03:54,370 --> 00:03:57,105
Penny, have you seen
my good inhaler?

92
00:03:59,208 --> 00:04:02,176
Break it off,
shake hands, walk away.

93
00:04:06,915 --> 00:04:09,784
Hey, how's dating
two women going?

94
00:04:09,786 --> 00:04:11,786
Um, kind of hit a bump.

95
00:04:11,788 --> 00:04:14,889
When I was honest and told Emily
she wasn't the only person

96
00:04:14,891 --> 00:04:16,224
I was seeing, it went great.

97
00:04:16,226 --> 00:04:18,393
So I tried the same thing
with Lucy.

98
00:04:18,395 --> 00:04:19,627
And?

99
00:04:19,629 --> 00:04:22,597
She had mixed feelings.

100
00:04:22,599 --> 00:04:24,999
But when I said,
"Emily was cool with it.

101
00:04:25,001 --> 00:04:27,402
Emily's the best. Why can't you
be more like Emily?"...

102
00:04:29,238 --> 00:04:32,740
...those feelings
became less mixed.

103
00:04:33,942 --> 00:04:37,645
Women. Who knows
what'll set 'em off?

104
00:04:37,647 --> 00:04:41,582
At least now I can focus all
my energies on just one girl.

105
00:04:41,584 --> 00:04:43,584
I hope I get to meet her
as soon as possible.

106
00:04:43,586 --> 00:04:45,286
Why the rush?
She isn't going anywhere.

107
00:04:45,288 --> 00:04:47,922
She is. But I like
that attitude.

108
00:04:49,591 --> 00:04:53,461
Gentlemen, is anybody interested
in my old string theory books?

109
00:04:53,463 --> 00:04:55,196
You're really
going to do this?

110
00:04:55,198 --> 00:04:58,733
I am. Yeah, Penny pointed out
that what I'm going through

111
00:04:58,735 --> 00:04:59,934
is essentially a breakup.

112
00:04:59,936 --> 00:05:02,703
And according
to <i>Cosmopolitan</i> magazine,

113
00:05:02,705 --> 00:05:05,339
one of the most effective
techniques for moving on

114
00:05:05,341 --> 00:05:08,376
is to get rid of all reminders
of the relationship.

115
00:05:08,378 --> 00:05:10,378
You're reading <i>Cosmo?</i>
Yes.

116
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:12,914
as it turns out,
there's an article,

117
00:05:12,916 --> 00:05:15,983
on how to get over a breakup
in literally every issue.

118
00:05:16,819 --> 00:05:18,219
Anyway,

119
00:05:18,221 --> 00:05:20,354
it suggests that I
set these on fire,

120
00:05:20,356 --> 00:05:22,457
but the smell of burning books

121
00:05:22,459 --> 00:05:25,660
reminds me of church picnics
in East Texas.

122
00:05:27,162 --> 00:05:29,163
What's this?
Oh,

123
00:05:29,165 --> 00:05:32,934
that's just a doodle of
a hyperelliptic Riemann surface.

124
00:05:32,936 --> 00:05:36,137
Oh, yeah. Wasn't that the basis
of your postdoc fellowship?

125
00:05:36,139 --> 00:05:37,371
It was.

126
00:05:37,373 --> 00:05:39,474
This seemed so elegant
at the time,

127
00:05:39,476 --> 00:05:40,641
but...

128
00:05:40,643 --> 00:05:43,344
now I realize I was just
a simple country boy

129
00:05:43,346 --> 00:05:45,847
seduced by a big city theory

130
00:05:45,849 --> 00:05:48,683
with variables
in all the right places.

131
00:05:50,152 --> 00:05:52,453
It's going to be okay.
I know.

132
00:05:52,455 --> 00:05:54,689
As hard as this is,
I have to move on.

133
00:05:54,691 --> 00:05:57,525
I can't keep postulating
multidimensional entities

134
00:05:57,527 --> 00:05:59,327
and get nothing in return.

135
00:05:59,329 --> 00:06:01,095
I have needs, too.

136
00:06:07,070 --> 00:06:08,769
So, you and Emily
still together?

137
00:06:16,045 --> 00:06:18,479
I spoke to Bernadette.
She's free tomorrow night.

138
00:06:18,481 --> 00:06:19,914
Oh, okay, great.

139
00:06:19,916 --> 00:06:22,183
But if we're really gonna do
a double date,

140
00:06:22,185 --> 00:06:24,619
then we have to go over
some ground rules about Emily.

141
00:06:24,621 --> 00:06:26,921
Like when it turns out
she's made of rubber,

142
00:06:26,923 --> 00:06:28,556
I don't say anything?

143
00:06:30,092 --> 00:06:32,026
She's very real.

144
00:06:32,028 --> 00:06:34,529
Oh, that's what it says
on the box.

145
00:06:35,697 --> 00:06:38,666
Right next to "dishwasher safe."

146
00:06:39,501 --> 00:06:40,501
See?

147
00:06:40,503 --> 00:06:41,836
This is exactly
the kind of thing

148
00:06:41,838 --> 00:06:43,571
I'm worried about you
saying in front of her.

149
00:06:43,573 --> 00:06:45,840
I promise I'll be
on my best behavior.

150
00:06:45,842 --> 00:06:49,377
You better be. No jokes about
how close I am with my dog.

151
00:06:49,379 --> 00:06:53,214
Or the truth about how close
I am with my dog.

152
00:06:53,216 --> 00:06:54,615
You got it.

153
00:06:54,617 --> 00:06:56,684
No jokes about the
year I took ballet.

154
00:06:56,686 --> 00:06:58,386
You took ballet?

155
00:06:59,221 --> 00:07:01,389
God, you never listen.

156
00:07:04,192 --> 00:07:06,360
Are you sure you
want to do this?

157
00:07:06,362 --> 00:07:08,829
The magazine articles suggest
that one of the ways

158
00:07:08,831 --> 00:07:11,432
to get over a breakup
is a new look.

159
00:07:11,434 --> 00:07:12,867
Mmm. What about your old look,

160
00:07:12,869 --> 00:07:15,603
well-groomed ventriloquist doll?

161
00:07:17,205 --> 00:07:20,441
"Oh, my God, I do look like that."
Stop it!

162
00:07:21,877 --> 00:07:25,046
So, how do you want me to cut it?
Oh,

163
00:07:25,048 --> 00:07:29,450
how about Bill Gates
meets Nikola Tesla?

164
00:07:30,252 --> 00:07:31,719
So, business in the front,

165
00:07:31,721 --> 00:07:33,621
science in the back.

166
00:07:33,623 --> 00:07:35,222
Or I don't cut it

167
00:07:35,224 --> 00:07:36,891
and maybe just style it
a little.

168
00:07:36,893 --> 00:07:38,559
Oh, I'm in
your hands.

169
00:07:38,561 --> 00:07:41,929
Do a good job and I'll tell you
<i>Cosmo's</i> ten dynamite tips

170
00:07:41,931 --> 00:07:44,265
to enjoy your PMS.

171
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,267
Can you keep him quiet?

172
00:07:46,269 --> 00:07:47,835
Maybe jangle some keys
in front of him?

173
00:07:47,837 --> 00:07:49,036
That doesn't
work anymore.

174
00:07:49,038 --> 00:07:51,806
He just thinks I'm taking him
to the doctor.

175
00:07:53,008 --> 00:07:54,976
So, now that you're
no longer invested

176
00:07:54,978 --> 00:07:57,612
in string theory,
what are you gonna pursue?

177
00:07:57,614 --> 00:07:59,614
Oh, there are so
many exciting areas:

178
00:07:59,616 --> 00:08:02,650
black holes, dark matter...
Oh,

179
00:08:02,652 --> 00:08:04,118
Leonard was telling me
about dark matter,

180
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:05,686
but I didn't
really understand it.

181
00:08:05,688 --> 00:08:08,756
Don't feel bad.
Neither does he.

182
00:08:12,127 --> 00:08:14,161
Okay...

183
00:08:14,163 --> 00:08:16,330
what do you think?

184
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:21,268
Have you ever even seen
a picture of Tesla?

185
00:08:22,037 --> 00:08:23,804
It actually
looks good, Sheldon.

186
00:08:23,806 --> 00:08:26,007
Doesn't it?
Yeah.

187
00:08:26,009 --> 00:08:31,112
I suppose I could see myself
in a scientific boy band.

188
00:08:31,114 --> 00:08:33,514
Of course, I'd be the dreamy one
and the smart one.

189
00:08:35,385 --> 00:08:36,951
Sorry I'm late.

190
00:08:37,719 --> 00:08:39,453
What did you do?

191
00:08:39,455 --> 00:08:41,722
I gave him a new look.
It's cute, huh?

192
00:08:41,724 --> 00:08:44,525
Yeah, it's cute.
That's the problem.

193
00:08:44,527 --> 00:08:46,827
I don't need other girls
to see him walking around

194
00:08:46,829 --> 00:08:48,963
like sex on a stick.

195
00:08:50,499 --> 00:08:53,634
She's right.
I'm too hot.

196
00:08:58,273 --> 00:08:59,874
I'm excited
to meet Emily.

197
00:08:59,876 --> 00:09:02,810
Me, too. I just hope
he doesn't blow it.

198
00:09:02,812 --> 00:09:04,745
Why would you
say that?

199
00:09:04,747 --> 00:09:08,516
Because he's Raj--
that's his thing.

200
00:09:08,518 --> 00:09:11,719
Beckham can bend it, Ralph
can wreck it, Raj can blow it.

201
00:09:13,055 --> 00:09:15,089
Look, I don't want it
to happen,

202
00:09:15,091 --> 00:09:17,825
but odds are he's gonna
find a way to...

203
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:20,661
Oh, crap,
I know that girl.

204
00:09:20,663 --> 00:09:21,696
How?

205
00:09:21,698 --> 00:09:24,131
In a bad way, very bad.

206
00:09:24,133 --> 00:09:25,399
Hey, guys.

207
00:09:25,401 --> 00:09:27,001
Whatever you hear tonight,
just remember I love you.

208
00:09:27,003 --> 00:09:28,402
Hey!

209
00:09:36,788 --> 00:09:39,890
Emily, these are my good
friends, Howard and Bernadette.

210
00:09:39,892 --> 00:09:41,992
Guys, this is Emily.
Nice to meet you.

211
00:09:41,994 --> 00:09:43,193
Hi.
Hello.

212
00:09:43,195 --> 00:09:45,228
Have we met before?

213
00:09:45,997 --> 00:09:49,332
Uh... no.

214
00:09:49,334 --> 00:09:50,133
I-I don't...

215
00:09:50,135 --> 00:09:51,868
I don't... think so.

216
00:09:51,870 --> 00:09:53,503
You sure? You look familiar.

217
00:09:53,505 --> 00:09:55,839
Well, you sure don't.

218
00:09:55,841 --> 00:09:57,741
You I know,
you I know, you?

219
00:09:57,743 --> 00:10:00,710
Total stranger.

220
00:10:00,712 --> 00:10:04,915
Even if you had yummy candy,
I would not get in your van.

221
00:10:04,917 --> 00:10:07,951
Did you go to that spin class
on Green Street?

222
00:10:07,953 --> 00:10:09,786
That must be it.

223
00:10:09,788 --> 00:10:12,122
Since when do you go
to spin class?

224
00:10:12,124 --> 00:10:14,457
Wow. Now who doesn't listen?

225
00:10:16,994 --> 00:10:18,495
Sheldon,
your food's getting cold.

226
00:10:18,497 --> 00:10:20,697
What are you doing?
Oh, looking through

227
00:10:20,699 --> 00:10:23,967
my textbooks
for a new field of inquiry.

228
00:10:23,969 --> 00:10:26,970
Why do we have a geology book?

229
00:10:26,972 --> 00:10:29,306
Leonard, did you throw

230
00:10:29,308 --> 00:10:31,808
a children's party
while I was in Texas?

231
00:10:32,910 --> 00:10:34,678
Wait. What's wrong with geology?

232
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:37,213
Let me put this in a way
you'll understand, Penny.

233
00:10:37,215 --> 00:10:39,082
You remember
how you explained to me

234
00:10:39,084 --> 00:10:41,518
that the Kardashians
aren't real celebrities?

235
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:43,153
Well, geology

236
00:10:43,155 --> 00:10:45,488
is the Kardashians of science.

237
00:10:46,490 --> 00:10:48,091
Have you considered

238
00:10:48,093 --> 00:10:50,260
studying standard model physics?

239
00:10:50,262 --> 00:10:52,262
You want me
to give up string theory

240
00:10:52,264 --> 00:10:53,830
for something
that's less advanced?

241
00:10:53,832 --> 00:10:55,999
You know, why don't you break up
with Penny

242
00:10:56,001 --> 00:10:58,201
and start dating a brown bear?

243
00:10:59,470 --> 00:11:02,706
Like you could
get a brown bear.

244
00:11:02,708 --> 00:11:04,174
Hey, I've got a good job.

245
00:11:04,176 --> 00:11:06,376
I could buy salmon.
You don't know.

246
00:11:07,645 --> 00:11:09,612
Maybe you could make
your new field of study

247
00:11:09,614 --> 00:11:11,514
the calculation
of nuclear matrix elements.

248
00:11:11,516 --> 00:11:13,016
Oh, please.

249
00:11:13,018 --> 00:11:16,653
If I wanted to take up a fad,
I'd get a tramp stamp.

250
00:11:19,757 --> 00:11:21,891
What about loop quantum gravity?

251
00:11:21,893 --> 00:11:24,194
Oh, Duchess, look at me.

252
00:11:24,196 --> 00:11:27,030
My quantum gravity's
positively loopy.

253
00:11:28,432 --> 00:11:30,166
Who's the duchess?

254
00:11:30,168 --> 00:11:33,336
One of the people
that lives in his head.

255
00:11:33,338 --> 00:11:36,272
I hope he's this distraught
if he ever breaks up with me.

256
00:11:36,274 --> 00:11:39,042
Well, if he does, I'll see
if my bear has a friend.

257
00:11:41,278 --> 00:11:42,479
Sheldon, have you
ever considered

258
00:11:42,481 --> 00:11:43,546
not rushing into something new?

259
00:11:43,548 --> 00:11:45,181
I mean, why don't you
take your time,

260
00:11:45,183 --> 00:11:46,783
enjoy your freedom?

261
00:11:46,785 --> 00:11:50,186
Maybe something new
to study will find you.

262
00:11:51,288 --> 00:11:53,189
That's actually not bad advice.

263
00:11:53,191 --> 00:11:55,358
You know, I didn't seek out
string theory.

264
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:57,961
It just hit me
over the head one day.

265
00:11:57,963 --> 00:11:59,662
How does that happen?

266
00:11:59,664 --> 00:12:01,765
A bully chased me through
the school library

267
00:12:01,767 --> 00:12:05,101
and hit me over the head with
the biggest book he could find.

268
00:12:06,837 --> 00:12:08,838
Okay, how about we toast
your newfound freedom?

269
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:12,409
Ah, normally
I refrain from alcohol,

270
00:12:12,411 --> 00:12:15,678
but since my cerebral cortex is
twiddling its proverbial thumbs,

271
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:17,480
why not soak it in grape juice

272
00:12:17,482 --> 00:12:19,949
that's been predigested
by a fungus?

273
00:12:21,152 --> 00:12:24,020
And you wonder why other
children beat you with books.

274
00:12:24,022 --> 00:12:25,522
Cheers!

275
00:12:28,059 --> 00:12:30,160
Emily, what
do you do?

276
00:12:30,162 --> 00:12:32,729
I'm a dermatology resident
at Huntington Hospital.

277
00:12:32,731 --> 00:12:34,597
Mmm, and you know
what that means.

278
00:12:34,599 --> 00:12:38,435
Someone's skin's about
to be softer than ever.

279
00:12:39,403 --> 00:12:40,837
This is making
me crazy.

280
00:12:40,839 --> 00:12:42,672
I know I know you
from somewhere.

281
00:12:42,674 --> 00:12:44,607
Oh, uh, Howard
was an astronaut.

282
00:12:44,609 --> 00:12:46,609
Maybe that's where you saw him.
Wow!

283
00:12:46,611 --> 00:12:48,078
That's amazing.

284
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:49,379
What was that like?

285
00:12:49,381 --> 00:12:52,382
It was the most incredible
experience of my life.

286
00:12:52,384 --> 00:12:55,318
Up there
in the space station, you're...

287
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:57,454
Oh, my God, I remember.

288
00:12:57,456 --> 00:13:00,490
Can I finish my astronaut story?

289
00:13:00,492 --> 00:13:01,991
It was four years ago.

290
00:13:01,993 --> 00:13:04,127
Please don't say it.
We were set up on a blind date.

291
00:13:04,129 --> 00:13:05,862
Please don't say it.
You came to my apartment.

292
00:13:05,864 --> 00:13:07,997
You're saying it.

293
00:13:07,999 --> 00:13:09,666
Well, wh-what happened?

294
00:13:09,668 --> 00:13:11,501
Yeah, what happened?
Okay, I'll say it.

295
00:13:12,704 --> 00:13:16,072
I was on the way to pick her up.

296
00:13:16,074 --> 00:13:18,274
My stomach felt a little funny.

297
00:13:18,276 --> 00:13:21,644
When I got there, I asked
if I could use her bathroom.

298
00:13:21,646 --> 00:13:23,646
Please don't say it.

299
00:13:26,117 --> 00:13:28,685
One roll of toilet paper
and 20 minutes later,

300
00:13:28,687 --> 00:13:31,020
I was so humiliated,

301
00:13:31,022 --> 00:13:34,023
I snuck out the window
and never saw her again.

302
00:13:34,025 --> 00:13:35,992
You know what else
I never saw again--

303
00:13:35,994 --> 00:13:37,994
my security deposit.

304
00:13:37,996 --> 00:13:39,596
I'm sorry.

305
00:13:39,598 --> 00:13:42,765
I tried to unclog it,
but you didn't have a plunger,

306
00:13:42,767 --> 00:13:44,434
and water was
spilling out everywhere.

307
00:13:44,436 --> 00:13:46,369
Right, just water.

308
00:13:48,105 --> 00:13:50,540
Look, I have felt terrible
about this for years,

309
00:13:50,542 --> 00:13:52,275
and I'm glad
I have the opportunity

310
00:13:52,277 --> 00:13:54,911
to tell you
just how sorry I am.

311
00:13:54,913 --> 00:13:56,279
It's fine.

312
00:13:56,947 --> 00:13:58,548
All my friends love this story.

313
00:13:58,550 --> 00:14:00,783
They call you Clogzilla.

314
00:14:00,785 --> 00:14:02,652
Get it?

315
00:14:02,654 --> 00:14:04,254
Because you clogged up
her bathroom

316
00:14:04,256 --> 00:14:05,822
like a radioactive monster!

317
00:14:07,125 --> 00:14:08,525
Yeah, yeah, I get it.

318
00:14:08,527 --> 00:14:09,692
Howie.

319
00:14:09,694 --> 00:14:11,161
Well, hey, it's not like
cotton candy

320
00:14:11,163 --> 00:14:12,529
comes out of you.

321
00:14:15,266 --> 00:14:16,633
Come on, let's
get you to bed.

322
00:14:16,635 --> 00:14:17,834
You've had a lot
to drink.

323
00:14:17,836 --> 00:14:19,302
No more than Penny.

324
00:14:19,304 --> 00:14:21,304
That's what I'm saying.

325
00:14:21,306 --> 00:14:23,573
Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait.

326
00:14:24,708 --> 00:14:26,609
Empty room.

327
00:14:26,611 --> 00:14:28,278
Empty room.

328
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:30,914
Empty room.

329
00:14:30,916 --> 00:14:33,316
If somebody says "Come in,"
I'm gonna freak out.

330
00:14:38,489 --> 00:14:40,023
So, Emily, why did you

331
00:14:40,025 --> 00:14:41,858
decide to specialize
in dermatology?

332
00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:43,960
I like cutting
people with knives,

333
00:14:43,962 --> 00:14:47,997
and all the other jobs where
you get to do that are illegal.

334
00:14:48,866 --> 00:14:50,266
You're kidding, right?

335
00:14:54,805 --> 00:14:56,539
She's scary,
but it's a cute scary.

336
00:14:57,709 --> 00:14:59,976
Can I say just one more thing?

337
00:14:59,978 --> 00:15:02,946
I had some kind
of food poisoning that day.

338
00:15:02,948 --> 00:15:05,748
Sure, in retrospect,
gas station sushi--

339
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:07,217
maybe not the best choice.

340
00:15:07,219 --> 00:15:09,118
Nor was climbing out

341
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:10,186
your window and running away.

342
00:15:10,188 --> 00:15:11,654
But I think
we can all understand

343
00:15:11,656 --> 00:15:13,089
how humiliating that was,
and I'd really

344
00:15:13,091 --> 00:15:14,524
appreciate it
if we could move on.

345
00:15:14,526 --> 00:15:16,559
Howie, we moved on
a long time ago.

346
00:15:16,561 --> 00:15:18,962
I'm just saying...
We moved on.

347
00:15:20,364 --> 00:15:23,299
Okay. Fine.

348
00:15:25,703 --> 00:15:26,903
How's your soup?

349
00:15:26,905 --> 00:15:28,104
Ah, it's all right.

350
00:15:28,106 --> 00:15:30,106
They could've filled
the bowl a little more.

351
00:15:34,078 --> 00:15:35,478
Excuse me.

352
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:36,813
Where are you going?

353
00:15:36,815 --> 00:15:38,081
I need some fresh air.

354
00:15:38,083 --> 00:15:39,949
Been there.

356
00:16:00,671 --> 00:16:02,905
Oh, no.

357
00:16:02,907 --> 00:16:05,108
What have I done?

358
00:16:28,832 --> 00:16:30,600
How you feeling?

359
00:16:31,435 --> 00:16:33,336
Not so good.

360
00:16:35,105 --> 00:16:38,374
Are you gonna introduce me
to your friend?

361
00:16:39,476 --> 00:16:41,177
It's not my friend.

362
00:16:41,179 --> 00:16:43,379
Nothing happened.

363
00:16:43,381 --> 00:16:44,514
I don't know.

364
00:16:44,516 --> 00:16:48,117
I heard you reading pretty loud
last night.

365
00:16:48,952 --> 00:16:50,920
Oh, dear Lord.

366
00:16:50,922 --> 00:16:52,922
Where's Amy?

367
00:16:52,924 --> 00:16:55,058
After she put you to bed,
she went home.

368
00:16:55,060 --> 00:16:56,893
Oh.

369
00:16:56,895 --> 00:17:00,163
I should call her and apologize.

370
00:17:00,165 --> 00:17:02,365
Oh.

371
00:17:02,367 --> 00:17:05,301
Oh, no.
What?

372
00:17:05,303 --> 00:17:09,339
Apparently, I called
Stephen Hawking last night.

373
00:17:09,341 --> 00:17:11,641
First new message.

374
00:17:11,643 --> 00:17:14,677
Hawkman!

375
00:17:14,679 --> 00:17:18,314
It's your old buddy
Sheldonoscopy!

376
00:17:19,983 --> 00:17:22,418
How come you didn't
pick up the phone?!

377
00:17:22,420 --> 00:17:24,687
Oh, right. My bad.

378
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:32,095
You're awful quiet.
Everything okay?

379
00:17:32,930 --> 00:17:34,630
Not really.

380
00:17:34,632 --> 00:17:37,834
I had a bit
of an embarrassing evening.

381
00:17:37,836 --> 00:17:40,403
Ugh. Me, too.
What happened?

382
00:17:40,405 --> 00:17:42,171
I drank alcohol

383
00:17:42,173 --> 00:17:47,310
and may have left an unfortunate
voice mail for Stephen Hawking.

384
00:17:47,312 --> 00:17:49,712
I wouldn't worry about it.

385
00:17:49,714 --> 00:17:51,881
He's got a pretty good
sense of humor.

386
00:17:51,883 --> 00:17:54,650
Oh, I hope so.

387
00:17:54,652 --> 00:17:56,886
What happened to you
last night?

388
00:17:56,888 --> 00:17:58,888
Oh, well, turns out

389
00:17:58,890 --> 00:18:01,591
I'd already met the girl
Raj is seeing

390
00:18:01,593 --> 00:18:04,927
when I did a number
on her bathroom.

391
00:18:08,298 --> 00:18:10,500
And that number was two.

392
00:18:12,836 --> 00:18:15,872
Well, you know,
I've always been a fan

393
00:18:15,874 --> 00:18:18,875
of a story told
by Attar of Nishapur,

394
00:18:18,877 --> 00:18:20,009
about a king

395
00:18:20,011 --> 00:18:22,979
who assembled a group
of wise men

396
00:18:22,981 --> 00:18:26,749
to create a ring that would
make him happy when he was sad.

397
00:18:26,751 --> 00:18:28,551
And that ring

398
00:18:28,553 --> 00:18:32,622
was inscribed with the phrase,
"This too shall pass."

399
00:18:34,224 --> 00:18:36,659
Hey, Cooper!
Oh, my God.

400
00:18:36,661 --> 00:18:40,263
I heard you drunk-dialed
Stephen Hawking last night?

401
00:18:40,265 --> 00:18:42,331
Classic!

402
00:18:42,333 --> 00:18:43,433
Get out of here, Barry.

403
00:18:43,435 --> 00:18:45,435
Whatever you say...

404
00:18:45,437 --> 00:18:47,637
Clogzilla.

405
00:18:51,208 --> 00:18:53,342
Clogzilla. That's pretty funny.

406
00:18:54,578 --> 00:18:57,814
I don't think
that's gonna pass.

407
00:19:06,224 --> 00:19:08,192
Next message.

408
00:19:08,194 --> 00:19:10,027
It's me again!

409
00:19:10,029 --> 00:19:12,429
I gave up string theory.

410
00:19:12,431 --> 00:19:14,298
You should give up black holes,

411
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:17,100
and we can totally
solve crimes together!

412
00:19:18,703 --> 00:19:20,504
Next message.

413
00:19:20,506 --> 00:19:22,039
Do you know what's great?!

414
00:19:22,041 --> 00:19:25,476
Geology. Oh!

415
00:19:25,478 --> 00:19:28,378
Look at this geode!

416
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:30,714
That's fun to say!

417
00:19:30,716 --> 00:19:35,018
Gee... ode! Gee... ode!

418
00:19:35,020 --> 00:19:36,854
Next message.

419
00:19:36,856 --> 00:19:39,456
Gee... ode!

420
00:19:39,458 --> 00:19:41,959
Gee... ode!

421
00:19:41,961 --> 00:19:44,194
I kiss girls now.

422
00:19:45,897 --> 00:19:47,764
Next message.

423
00:19:47,766 --> 00:19:49,466
Hey, guess who I am!

424
00:19:49,468 --> 00:19:50,834
Beep bop boop bop!

425
00:19:50,836 --> 00:19:53,170
I'm you! Get it?!

426
00:19:54,372 --> 00:19:56,240
Next message.

427
00:19:56,242 --> 00:19:58,475
Are you mad at me?

428
00:19:59,344 --> 00:20:02,412
Oh, no, you're mad at me.

429
00:20:02,414 --> 00:20:04,648
I'm so sorry!

430
00:20:04,650 --> 00:20:07,017
Beep bop boop bop.

431
00:20:07,785 --> 00:20:09,319
Next message.

432
00:20:09,321 --> 00:20:14,324
Thiospinel sulfide.
Thiospinel sulfide.

433
00:20:14,326 --> 00:20:17,794
That's even more fun
than "gee... ode."

434
00:20:18,846 --> 00:20:21,213
Hey, did you see
<i>The Lego Movie?</i>

435
00:20:24,605 --> 00:20:26,138
What a jackass.
