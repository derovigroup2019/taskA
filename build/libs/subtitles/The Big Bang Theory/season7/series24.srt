1
00:00:03,864 --> 00:00:05,965
How's your mom
holding up?

2
00:00:05,967 --> 00:00:09,135
She's doing okay, but we just
lost another nurse.

3
00:00:09,137 --> 00:00:10,370
How many is that now?

4
00:00:10,372 --> 00:00:12,038
Two, and I know what
you're thinking--

5
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:14,207
she's eating them.

6
00:00:16,277 --> 00:00:18,544
She's just so impossible,
they keep quitting.

7
00:00:18,546 --> 00:00:20,146
So, who's
watching her now?

8
00:00:20,148 --> 00:00:23,750
A bowl full of M&M's with
a few Ambien tossed in.

9
00:00:23,752 --> 00:00:25,318
What up, guys?

10
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:26,586
Hello. - Hey.  -Hello.

11
00:00:26,588 --> 00:00:28,621
Okay.

12
00:00:28,623 --> 00:00:30,123
Well, now that
everyone's here,

13
00:00:30,125 --> 00:00:32,759
Penny and I have
some big news.

14
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:34,560
We're engaged!

15
00:00:41,035 --> 00:00:43,236
And I thought me having sex with
Emily was gonna be the big news.

16
00:00:47,108 --> 00:00:48,775
Hey! Hey!

17
00:00:49,943 --> 00:00:51,978
What the hell!

18
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:53,780
You guys propose all the time.

19
00:00:53,782 --> 00:00:56,082
This never happens.

20
00:00:56,084 --> 00:00:57,550
You're right!

21
00:01:00,155 --> 00:01:03,790
? Our whole universe
was in a hot, dense state ?

22
00:01:03,792 --> 00:01:07,126
? Then nearly 14 billion years
ago expansion started... Wait! ?

23
00:01:07,128 --> 00:01:08,728
? The Earth began to cool

24
00:01:08,730 --> 00:01:11,297
? The autotrophs began to drool,
Neanderthals developed tools ?

25
00:01:11,299 --> 00:01:13,966
? We built the Wall
? <i>We built the pyramids</i> ?

26
00:01:13,968 --> 00:01:16,636
? Math, Science, History,
unraveling the mystery ?

27
00:01:16,638 --> 00:01:18,504
? That all started
with a big bang ?

28
00:01:18,506 --> 00:01:20,506
? <i>Bang!</i> ?

29
00:01:20,536 --> 00:01:24,536

31
00:01:29,588 --> 00:01:32,490
Boy, I'm so
hungry today.

32
00:01:32,492 --> 00:01:35,259
I wonder why?

33
00:01:36,629 --> 00:01:38,496
Because you had sex
the other night?

34
00:01:38,698 --> 00:01:40,665
You know what?

35
00:01:40,667 --> 00:01:43,368
That may be it.

36
00:01:44,770 --> 00:01:46,938
By the way,
it isn't like riding a bike.

37
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:49,107
Like, I fell off a few times.

38
00:01:51,310 --> 00:01:52,276
Hey, buddy.

39
00:01:52,278 --> 00:01:54,112
Hello.

40
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:55,380
You okay?

41
00:01:55,382 --> 00:01:57,148
I just got called

42
00:01:57,150 --> 00:01:59,517
into President Siebert's office.

43
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:01,052
The university

44
00:02:01,054 --> 00:02:04,922
won't let me switch my field of
study to inflationary cosmology.

45
00:02:04,924 --> 00:02:08,059
They're forcing me
to continue with string theory.

46
00:02:08,061 --> 00:02:09,694
Why?

47
00:02:09,696 --> 00:02:11,162
He said it's why they hired me,

48
00:02:11,164 --> 00:02:13,398
it's-it's what my grant
was designated for,

49
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:16,968
and that everybody has to do
things they don't want to do.

50
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:19,303
He then gave an example
of something he had to do,

51
00:02:19,305 --> 00:02:20,438
even though he didn't want to,

52
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:23,508
which was look
at my stupid face.

53
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:25,676
That's a rude thing to say.

54
00:02:25,678 --> 00:02:28,045
Out loud.

55
00:02:30,282 --> 00:02:31,716
It's an outrage.

56
00:02:31,718 --> 00:02:34,051
Honestly, I'm tempted
to leave the university.

57
00:02:34,053 --> 00:02:36,120
You know, if you're really
serious about that,

58
00:02:36,122 --> 00:02:38,523
I hear there are
some exciting opportunities

59
00:02:38,525 --> 00:02:41,859
in home care
for the old and fat.

60
00:02:41,861 --> 00:02:45,296
Whatever you do, just don't
make any rash decisions.

61
00:02:45,298 --> 00:02:46,531
I don't know.

62
00:02:46,533 --> 00:02:48,266
I am really aggravated.

63
00:02:49,568 --> 00:02:52,136
When I'm feeling low,
I have sex with a girl.

64
00:02:53,405 --> 00:02:55,706
But that's just me.

65
00:02:58,277 --> 00:03:01,345
Oh, come on, give her a chance.
No.

66
00:03:01,347 --> 00:03:03,080
Life, it is too short.

67
00:03:03,082 --> 00:03:06,184
I know you've only been
here a day and a half,

68
00:03:06,186 --> 00:03:07,819
but you're like
part of the family!

69
00:03:09,956 --> 00:03:13,591
I don't think the service is
gonna send any more people.

70
00:03:13,593 --> 00:03:18,863
Yeah, maybe it's time we just
release Ma back into the sea.

71
00:03:20,999 --> 00:03:22,767
That's not helpful.

72
00:03:22,769 --> 00:03:25,703
Well, then, we may need
to get used to the idea

73
00:03:25,705 --> 00:03:29,207
that we're gonna be living
here the next few months.

74
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:30,475
But we have jobs.

75
00:03:30,477 --> 00:03:32,610
We can't baby-sit her
24 hours a day.

76
00:03:32,612 --> 00:03:35,413
Well, what if we use
our vacation time?

77
00:03:35,415 --> 00:03:39,350
I wanted to go to Hawaii,
not Hell.

78
00:03:39,352 --> 00:03:41,419
I don't know
what else we can do.

79
00:03:41,421 --> 00:03:44,989
Howie, I love you,

80
00:03:44,991 --> 00:03:47,124
and as your wife, your
mother is every bit

81
00:03:47,126 --> 00:03:50,094
as much my problem as
she is yours, so...

82
00:03:50,096 --> 00:03:53,498
I want a divorce.

83
00:03:56,869 --> 00:03:58,469
Hello, Leonard.

84
00:03:58,471 --> 00:03:59,937
Hi, Mom.

85
00:03:59,939 --> 00:04:02,006
I have some exciting news.

86
00:04:02,008 --> 00:04:04,775
I'm listening.

87
00:04:04,777 --> 00:04:07,578
Before I tell you,
will you promise to try

88
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:11,582
and be happy for me and keep any
concerns you have to yourself?

89
00:04:11,584 --> 00:04:13,618
No.

90
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:18,856
Let me save you
all of your hemming and hawing.

91
00:04:18,858 --> 00:04:22,293
Sheldon already told me
that you and Penny are engaged.

92
00:04:22,295 --> 00:04:26,564
I-I hate that you talk to him
more than you talk to me.

93
00:04:26,566 --> 00:04:29,433
Would you <i>like</i> for you and me
to talk more?

94
00:04:31,470 --> 00:04:33,804
You know what?
It's probably fine.

95
00:04:33,806 --> 00:04:37,842
In any event, while I've had
my misgivings about...

96
00:04:37,844 --> 00:04:40,044
Penny...

97
00:04:41,313 --> 00:04:43,381
...Sheldon spoke
very fondly of her,

98
00:04:43,383 --> 00:04:45,616
and if she is good enough
for him,

99
00:04:45,618 --> 00:04:47,885
then she's good enough for me.

100
00:04:49,755 --> 00:04:51,222
I'm your son.

101
00:04:51,224 --> 00:04:54,191
What about the fact
that she's good enough for me?

102
00:04:55,761 --> 00:04:57,662
Sure.

103
00:04:57,664 --> 00:04:59,664
Thanks, Mom.

104
00:04:59,666 --> 00:05:01,666
Leonard,
would it make you feel better

105
00:05:01,668 --> 00:05:06,504
to hear that your mother
approved of your life choices?

106
00:05:06,506 --> 00:05:09,473
Yes, it would.

107
00:05:09,475 --> 00:05:13,177
Yeah. Well,
you should work on that.

108
00:05:16,782 --> 00:05:18,649
No, Mom, it's the same guy

109
00:05:18,651 --> 00:05:21,385
I've been going out with
for the past two years.

110
00:05:21,387 --> 00:05:23,454
Yeah, the scientist.

111
00:05:23,456 --> 00:05:24,822
Well, it's complicated.

112
00:05:24,824 --> 00:05:28,326
I mean, he works with lasers
and atomic magnets.

113
00:05:30,262 --> 00:05:33,197
No, I did not see it coming.

114
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:37,401
No, we did not set a date.

115
00:05:38,670 --> 00:05:40,705
Yeah, this is a first
for our family.

116
00:05:40,707 --> 00:05:42,573
All right, tell Dad I love him.

117
00:05:42,575 --> 00:05:43,608
I gotta go.

118
00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:44,709
All right, bye.

119
00:05:44,711 --> 00:05:45,810
Atomic magnets?

120
00:05:45,812 --> 00:05:46,944
Shut up.

121
00:05:48,247 --> 00:05:50,081
Sorry I'm late.

122
00:05:50,083 --> 00:05:53,884
The leaf blower broke, so I had
to hand-dry my mother-in-law.

123
00:05:53,886 --> 00:05:56,387
You want some wine?

124
00:05:56,389 --> 00:05:57,321
Thanks.

125
00:05:57,323 --> 00:05:59,090
Little warning
before you jump into

126
00:05:59,092 --> 00:06:00,091
this marriage business:

127
00:06:00,093 --> 00:06:01,392
You're not just marrying him,

128
00:06:01,394 --> 00:06:02,660
you're marrying his family.

129
00:06:02,662 --> 00:06:05,062
I think Leonard's mom's okay
with me.

130
00:06:05,064 --> 00:06:06,397
It doesn't matter
if she's okay with you.

131
00:06:06,399 --> 00:06:08,833
The question is: Can she go
to the bathroom by herself?

132
00:06:13,538 --> 00:06:16,140
Hit me again.

133
00:06:17,576 --> 00:06:20,544
So, what are the living
arrangements gonna be?

134
00:06:20,546 --> 00:06:22,747
Well, haven't really talked
about it yet, but I figure,

135
00:06:22,749 --> 00:06:25,416
at some point, I'll move in with
him, or he'll move in with me.

136
00:06:25,418 --> 00:06:28,152
Well, with you not working,
that makes financial sense.

137
00:06:28,154 --> 00:06:29,487
You're not working!

138
00:06:29,489 --> 00:06:32,056
How would you like a job
in home health care?

139
00:06:32,058 --> 00:06:34,158
Not a chance.

140
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:35,860
Please. I'm desperate.
No.

141
00:06:35,862 --> 00:06:38,295
I'll pay you anything you want.
Okay, then, yeah.

142
00:06:39,264 --> 00:06:41,999
No! Keep your money!

143
00:06:45,837 --> 00:06:48,973
I could've ridden a bull
longer than that.

144
00:06:51,376 --> 00:06:53,844
What you working on?

145
00:06:53,846 --> 00:06:55,846
I'm writing an appeal

146
00:06:55,848 --> 00:06:57,081
to the Faculty Senate,

147
00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:59,050
so that I can move on
from string theory.

148
00:06:59,052 --> 00:07:00,518
Oh. How's it going?

149
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:02,987
You tell me.

150
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:05,890
"Dear Esteemed Colleagues,

151
00:07:05,892 --> 00:07:07,658
"As you may know,
I have requested

152
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:09,293
"to change my field of study.

153
00:07:09,295 --> 00:07:10,795
"My decision
to do so

154
00:07:10,797 --> 00:07:13,130
"is, I believe,
in the best interest of science.

155
00:07:13,132 --> 00:07:16,200
"At your convenience, I'd be
happy to explain it to you

156
00:07:16,202 --> 00:07:19,036
in words you'll understand."

157
00:07:20,072 --> 00:07:23,107
It's nice
that you called them "esteemed."

158
00:07:23,109 --> 00:07:25,743
You're right.
I'll take that out.

159
00:07:27,212 --> 00:07:30,648
So, listen, there was something
I was hoping to float past you.

160
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:32,349
Mm.
Now that Penny and I are engaged,

161
00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:35,619
I thought we might want to talk
about our living arrangements.

162
00:07:35,621 --> 00:07:37,655
Of course.

163
00:07:37,657 --> 00:07:40,424
She's spent many nights here,
and you're worried

164
00:07:40,426 --> 00:07:45,029
about preserving the myth of her
virginity before the wedding.

165
00:07:46,898 --> 00:07:48,799
I'm not.

166
00:07:48,801 --> 00:07:50,735
Good, because not only has
that ship sailed,

167
00:07:50,737 --> 00:07:54,271
if it hit an iceberg,
countless men would perish.

168
00:07:54,273 --> 00:07:58,175
Actually, this is about where
she and I are going to live.

169
00:07:58,177 --> 00:07:59,677
What do you mean?

170
00:07:59,679 --> 00:08:02,747
Well... well, we might want
to live together.

171
00:08:02,749 --> 00:08:06,150
Oh, yeah, well, I've already
given this some thought,

172
00:08:06,152 --> 00:08:07,318
and...

173
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:10,387
I'm willing
to let Penny live with us

174
00:08:10,389 --> 00:08:13,524
one day a week
for a trial period.

175
00:08:15,127 --> 00:08:18,129
Now, obviously,
not when she's made cranky

176
00:08:18,131 --> 00:08:21,332
by the shedding
of her uterine lining.

177
00:08:23,001 --> 00:08:24,368
That's very sweet.

178
00:08:25,937 --> 00:08:30,307
But we were thinking more of us
maybe living together with...

179
00:08:30,309 --> 00:08:32,510
not you.

180
00:08:35,213 --> 00:08:37,381
I don't understand.

181
00:08:38,550 --> 00:08:41,819
How could we all live together
if I'm not there?

182
00:08:42,721 --> 00:08:44,889
Look, I-I know
this is... this is change,

183
00:08:44,891 --> 00:08:46,891
and that sounds scary, but...

184
00:08:46,893 --> 00:08:48,526
Where are you going to go?

185
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:50,094
I don't know.

186
00:08:50,096 --> 00:08:51,962
We just started
to think about this.

187
00:08:51,964 --> 00:08:53,497
Maybe I'll move
in with Penny,

188
00:08:53,499 --> 00:08:55,599
or maybe she and
I'll take this place,

189
00:08:55,601 --> 00:08:56,901
and you can move
across the hall.

190
00:08:56,903 --> 00:08:59,236
Move across the hall?!

191
00:08:59,838 --> 00:09:02,706
Did you take a marijuana?!

192
00:09:04,943 --> 00:09:06,911
No, I did not.

193
00:09:06,913 --> 00:09:09,647
Did you get hit
on the head with a coconut?

194
00:09:09,649 --> 00:09:11,482
No.
Well, then,

195
00:09:11,484 --> 00:09:12,917
I'm all out of guesses.

196
00:09:12,919 --> 00:09:14,285
What? Me move across the hall--

197
00:09:14,287 --> 00:09:16,420
Why would you even suggest
such a thing?

198
00:09:16,422 --> 00:09:17,788
Because I love Penny,

199
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:20,224
and want to give her
the life she deserves.

200
00:09:20,226 --> 00:09:22,193
I see.

201
00:09:22,195 --> 00:09:25,462
You're putting your future
bride's happiness above mine.

202
00:09:27,365 --> 00:09:30,201
Well, yeah.

203
00:09:30,203 --> 00:09:32,636
Wow.

204
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:40,074
Advertise your product or brand here

205
00:09:42,137 --> 00:09:46,040
How dare the university force me
to go back to string theory!

206
00:09:46,042 --> 00:09:47,775
They just don't appreciate you.

207
00:09:47,777 --> 00:09:50,245
Yeah, and on top of that,
Leonard has the audacity

208
00:09:50,247 --> 00:09:52,747
to suggest that now
that he and Penny are engaged,

209
00:09:52,749 --> 00:09:54,883
he may not want
to live with me anymore.

210
00:09:54,885 --> 00:09:57,051
Here, I made you some
Strawberry Quik.

211
00:09:57,053 --> 00:09:58,887
I have real problems here, Amy.

212
00:09:58,889 --> 00:10:01,756
I can't be mollified with a
beverage designed for children.

213
00:10:02,726 --> 00:10:04,225
Mmm! Yummy.

214
00:10:05,594 --> 00:10:07,996
You know, this might
work out for the best.

215
00:10:07,998 --> 00:10:09,564
I mean, you're
always complaining

216
00:10:09,566 --> 00:10:11,499
about what a terrible
roommate Leonard is.

217
00:10:11,501 --> 00:10:12,800
Like how he turns up

218
00:10:12,802 --> 00:10:14,202
the thermostat when
you're not there.

219
00:10:14,204 --> 00:10:17,372
Ugh! It's like walking
into the Amazon.

220
00:10:17,374 --> 00:10:19,874
And not the good Amazon
with one-day shipping.

221
00:10:19,876 --> 00:10:23,144
The awful one
with birds and snakes.

222
00:10:23,146 --> 00:10:26,180
You hate the sound of all
those keys on his key chain.

223
00:10:26,182 --> 00:10:28,216
Four keys!

224
00:10:28,218 --> 00:10:30,351
Who does he think
he is, a warden?

225
00:10:31,453 --> 00:10:34,322
See? Maybe you'll
love living alone.

226
00:10:34,324 --> 00:10:37,025
I don't know. Perhaps.

227
00:10:37,027 --> 00:10:39,494
And if it turns
out you don't...

228
00:10:39,496 --> 00:10:41,396
you and I could
live together.

229
00:10:41,398 --> 00:10:43,831
You and... Oh, sure.

230
00:10:43,833 --> 00:10:45,266
And while we're at it,

231
00:10:45,268 --> 00:10:46,768
why don't we get engaged, too?

232
00:10:46,770 --> 00:10:49,003
Why don't we get a little house,
start a family?

233
00:10:49,005 --> 00:10:50,438
Enjoy our sunset years together?

234
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:53,341
Do you hear yourself, woman?!

235
00:10:53,343 --> 00:10:56,177
Sheldon, it was just a thought.
No.

236
00:10:56,179 --> 00:10:57,178
Here's a thought.

237
00:10:57,180 --> 00:10:58,246
You're not moving in,

238
00:10:58,248 --> 00:10:59,347
Leonard's not moving out,

239
00:10:59,349 --> 00:11:05,186
everything stays
exactly the way it is.

240
00:11:05,188 --> 00:11:06,821
and you're supposed
to use the powder!

241
00:11:07,790 --> 00:11:09,190
It tastes the same.

242
00:11:09,192 --> 00:11:11,693
No. The syrup tastes better
and I don't like it.

243
00:11:15,264 --> 00:11:16,898
This is so sweet!

244
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:18,666
You never cook for me.
Well...

245
00:11:18,668 --> 00:11:21,636
you cook for me
all the time and...

246
00:11:21,638 --> 00:11:24,172
Ugh.

247
00:11:24,174 --> 00:11:25,673
If you don't like my cooking,

248
00:11:25,675 --> 00:11:27,075
why haven't you ever
said anything?

249
00:11:27,077 --> 00:11:31,112
It's hard to talk with
so much heavy chewing to do.

250
00:11:31,114 --> 00:11:33,214
Sorry. I'll get better.

251
00:11:33,216 --> 00:11:37,018
I know you'll try.

252
00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:39,954
So, should we talk
about setting a date?

253
00:11:39,956 --> 00:11:41,623
Well, I'd like
to pick one that works

254
00:11:41,625 --> 00:11:42,690
with my brother's schedule.

255
00:11:42,692 --> 00:11:44,325
Okay.
And when would that be?

256
00:11:44,327 --> 00:11:47,729
Uh, 12 to 18 months from now,
depending on good behavior.

257
00:11:49,566 --> 00:11:51,766
Hi, is Sheldon here?

258
00:11:51,768 --> 00:11:53,134
No, I thought he was with you.

259
00:11:53,136 --> 00:11:55,036
He was, but he stormed off

260
00:11:55,038 --> 00:11:57,472
and now he isn't answering his phone.
What happened?

261
00:11:57,474 --> 00:11:59,674
He was really angry
that you suggested he move out.

262
00:11:59,676 --> 00:12:01,075
Oh.

263
00:12:01,077 --> 00:12:02,644
I also mentioned that he and I
could live together

264
00:12:02,646 --> 00:12:04,178
but he was too mad at you
to realize

265
00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:06,080
what a great idea that is.

266
00:12:07,683 --> 00:12:10,485
Well, he's been having
a couple of tough days.

267
00:12:10,487 --> 00:12:11,686
I'm sure he's fine.
He probably just

268
00:12:11,688 --> 00:12:13,488
needs a little alone
time to decompress.

269
00:12:13,490 --> 00:12:15,490
You're probably right.

270
00:12:16,558 --> 00:12:18,092
So, what are you guys doing?

271
00:12:20,162 --> 00:12:22,897
Well, Leonard cooked for me
and now we're just having

272
00:12:22,899 --> 00:12:27,035
a nice dinner, you know,
as a newly engaged couple.

273
00:12:27,037 --> 00:12:29,437
That's nice.

274
00:12:34,209 --> 00:12:35,977
Anyway, as I was saying,

275
00:12:35,979 --> 00:12:39,280
Sheldon probably just needs
a little alone time.

276
00:12:40,315 --> 00:12:41,275
'Cause that's important.

277
00:12:45,487 --> 00:12:48,456
Not just for him, but for...

278
00:12:48,458 --> 00:12:50,725
most anybody, really.

279
00:12:50,727 --> 00:12:52,560
Don't I know it.

280
00:12:52,562 --> 00:12:53,695
What is that, polenta?

281
00:12:53,697 --> 00:12:55,329
Amy, get out.
Right.

282
00:13:01,437 --> 00:13:02,837
No.

283
00:13:05,808 --> 00:13:07,809
Hey, Sheldon.

284
00:13:07,811 --> 00:13:09,477
What happened?

285
00:13:09,479 --> 00:13:11,345
I was cooking
in the back room last night

286
00:13:11,347 --> 00:13:12,980
and the hot plate
caught on fire.

287
00:13:12,982 --> 00:13:15,683
And you couldn't put it out?

288
00:13:15,685 --> 00:13:16,918
I was across the street

289
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:19,620
at the do-it-yourself car wash,
taking a shower.

290
00:13:22,991 --> 00:13:24,726
So when will you reopen?

291
00:13:24,728 --> 00:13:26,060
Um, I don't know.

292
00:13:26,062 --> 00:13:29,497
I'm waiting to hear back
from the insurance company.

293
00:13:29,499 --> 00:13:32,066
So, tomorrow?

294
00:13:32,068 --> 00:13:35,203
I don't mean to be rude,
Sheldon, but, uh,

295
00:13:35,205 --> 00:13:37,105
my life is kind of
falling apart right now.

296
00:13:37,107 --> 00:13:39,006
<i>Your</i> life?

297
00:13:39,008 --> 00:13:41,542
The university is making
me do string theory

298
00:13:41,544 --> 00:13:45,246
and my girlfriend loves me so
much she wants to live with me.

299
00:13:45,248 --> 00:13:46,948
And now,

300
00:13:46,950 --> 00:13:51,085
the place I need to go when I'm
sad is damp and smells funny.

301
00:13:52,755 --> 00:13:54,789
Well, sorry I let you down.

302
00:13:54,791 --> 00:13:56,090
No.

303
00:13:56,092 --> 00:13:57,525
I do not accept this.

304
00:13:57,527 --> 00:13:59,794
Everything is changing
and I hate it.

305
00:13:59,796 --> 00:14:01,028
It stops now.

306
00:14:01,030 --> 00:14:02,930
I'm helping you
get back on your feet.

307
00:14:04,967 --> 00:14:08,703
I would like to purchase
this comic book, please.

308
00:14:09,705 --> 00:14:11,072
That'll be $2.99.

309
00:14:11,074 --> 00:14:13,775
Really? It's soaking wet.

310
00:14:13,777 --> 00:14:15,977
Fine, a dollar.

311
00:14:19,181 --> 00:14:20,314
Can you break a 20?

312
00:14:20,316 --> 00:14:22,383
No, I only have hundreds.

313
00:14:23,852 --> 00:14:25,653
You know what?

314
00:14:25,655 --> 00:14:28,189
I don't always recognize
sarcasm, but I do right now,

315
00:14:28,191 --> 00:14:30,358
and I don't appreciate it.

316
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:31,793
I'm sorry for your loss.

317
00:14:31,795 --> 00:14:34,562
But you're not the only one
whose day has been a disaster.

318
00:14:41,970 --> 00:14:44,872
That could have killed me.

319
00:14:44,874 --> 00:14:48,109
I can't catch a break.

320
00:14:50,379 --> 00:14:51,946
I haven't heard
from Sheldon in a while.

321
00:14:51,948 --> 00:14:53,147
You think he's okay?

322
00:14:53,149 --> 00:14:54,482
Oh, I'm sure he's fine.

323
00:14:54,484 --> 00:14:56,417
I'm gonna see where he is.

324
00:14:56,419 --> 00:14:58,519
How?

325
00:14:58,521 --> 00:15:00,922
Oh, I know his password,
so I can track his phone.

326
00:15:00,924 --> 00:15:02,523
You do that?

327
00:15:02,525 --> 00:15:05,493
Not always, but ever since he
wandered off at the swap meet

328
00:15:05,495 --> 00:15:08,830
chasing a balloon,
I get worried.

329
00:15:08,832 --> 00:15:10,331
He can take care of himself.

330
00:15:10,333 --> 00:15:11,799
Look, we went over
stranger danger

331
00:15:11,801 --> 00:15:14,335
and gave him that whistle.

332
00:15:14,337 --> 00:15:16,470
That's weird.

333
00:15:16,472 --> 00:15:19,040
What?
He's at the train station.

334
00:15:19,042 --> 00:15:20,608
So? He loves trains.

335
00:15:20,610 --> 00:15:22,610
It's dark out and he's
alone, I don't like it.

336
00:15:22,612 --> 00:15:23,845
Let's go get him.

337
00:15:23,847 --> 00:15:26,013
Oh, it's sweet how you
look out for him.

338
00:15:26,015 --> 00:15:27,181
You're a good guy.

339
00:15:27,183 --> 00:15:28,449
It's not just that.

340
00:15:28,451 --> 00:15:31,152
My mother would kill me if I let
something happen to him.

341
00:15:35,390 --> 00:15:38,459
Dude, I'm so sorry.

342
00:15:38,461 --> 00:15:39,760
Don't take this
the wrong way,

343
00:15:39,762 --> 00:15:42,530
but did you do this
for the insurance money?

344
00:15:42,532 --> 00:15:45,867
No. God, you sound like
the police, the firemen,

345
00:15:45,869 --> 00:15:48,970
my parents, my therapist
and the insurance company.

346
00:15:50,372 --> 00:15:52,607
We're here for you, man.
Whatever you need, okay?

347
00:15:52,609 --> 00:15:53,908
Uh, actually, I was
wondering if I could

348
00:15:53,910 --> 00:15:55,610
crash at your place
for a few nights.

349
00:15:55,612 --> 00:15:57,044
Sure, of course.

350
00:15:57,046 --> 00:15:58,779
Oh, actually, Emily was
gonna spend the night.

351
00:15:58,781 --> 00:16:01,716
You slept with her? Nice.

352
00:16:01,718 --> 00:16:03,484
Well, I can't take
all the credit.

353
00:16:03,486 --> 00:16:05,653
She let me do it
to her, but...

354
00:16:06,922 --> 00:16:10,191
Uh, but I can always
call her and cancel.

355
00:16:10,193 --> 00:16:12,627
Hang on. I know
a place you can stay

356
00:16:12,629 --> 00:16:14,795
and earn some money
at the same time.

357
00:16:14,797 --> 00:16:16,898
Great.
I just have to warn you,

358
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:21,068
it'll involve humiliation,
degradation and verbal abuse.

359
00:16:22,037 --> 00:16:24,438
So what's the catch?

360
00:16:30,012 --> 00:16:32,179
Sheldon.

361
00:16:32,181 --> 00:16:34,015
You tracked my phone?

362
00:16:34,017 --> 00:16:35,349
Yeah.

363
00:16:35,351 --> 00:16:39,353
Boy, you chase one balloon
for three miles.

364
00:16:41,356 --> 00:16:43,424
We were worried
about you.

365
00:16:43,426 --> 00:16:45,459
Don't be melodramatic.

366
00:16:45,461 --> 00:16:48,763
I'm just getting on a train
and leaving forever.

367
00:16:48,765 --> 00:16:50,765
Seriously?

368
00:16:50,767 --> 00:16:52,166
You don't even have
a change of clothes

369
00:16:52,168 --> 00:16:53,534
or a toothbrush.

370
00:16:53,536 --> 00:16:56,504
My plan is to stop at malls
and buy what I need.

371
00:16:56,506 --> 00:16:58,673
It's called
living off the land.

372
00:16:58,675 --> 00:17:01,042
Okay, I know you're upset

373
00:17:01,044 --> 00:17:03,010
and there's a lot
of stuff going on,

374
00:17:03,012 --> 00:17:04,645
but it's nothing
we can't work out.

375
00:17:04,647 --> 00:17:06,113
Come on, let's get you home.

376
00:17:06,115 --> 00:17:08,149
No. I've reached
my breaking point.

377
00:17:08,151 --> 00:17:10,117
I need to leave. Now.

378
00:17:10,119 --> 00:17:11,519
And go where?

379
00:17:11,521 --> 00:17:12,887
It doesn't matter.

380
00:17:12,889 --> 00:17:16,123
So a few things
don't go your way

381
00:17:16,125 --> 00:17:20,261
and your best decision is to
ride the rails like a hobo?

382
00:17:21,863 --> 00:17:23,798
I suppose it is.

383
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:25,866
Except I have a credit card.

384
00:17:25,868 --> 00:17:29,337
And I refuse to carry
my laptop at the end of a stick.

385
00:17:31,239 --> 00:17:35,142
And I'd sooner die
than eat beans out of a can.

386
00:17:35,144 --> 00:17:37,611
Come on, come home with us

387
00:17:37,613 --> 00:17:39,347
and tomorrow I'll-I'll
take you to Legoland.

388
00:17:39,349 --> 00:17:42,350
Legoland is not
the solution to everything.

389
00:17:43,151 --> 00:17:44,552
And it's too much of a scene

390
00:17:44,554 --> 00:17:46,754
since that movie came out.

391
00:17:47,756 --> 00:17:49,790
Then what can I do?

392
00:17:49,792 --> 00:17:52,126
Leonard, I am overwhelmed.

393
00:17:52,128 --> 00:17:55,896
Everything is changing
and it's simply too much.

394
00:17:55,898 --> 00:17:57,498
I need to get away and think.

395
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:59,433
Oh, c-come on, you know
you're overreacting.

396
00:17:59,435 --> 00:18:00,935
Leonard, hang on.

397
00:18:00,937 --> 00:18:04,105
Just... come here
for a second.

398
00:18:05,807 --> 00:18:07,341
Maybe we need to let him go.

399
00:18:07,343 --> 00:18:09,143
What?! Why?

400
00:18:09,145 --> 00:18:10,411
It might be good for him.

401
00:18:10,413 --> 00:18:11,345
Y-You know he can't

402
00:18:11,347 --> 00:18:13,347
take a trip like this
by himself.

403
00:18:13,349 --> 00:18:14,648
He's a grown man.

404
00:18:14,650 --> 00:18:17,218
No, he <i>looks</i> like a grown man.

405
00:18:18,887 --> 00:18:20,554
You've seen
<i>Freaky Friday,</i> sometimes

406
00:18:20,556 --> 00:18:23,657
little kids end up
in big person bodies.

407
00:18:24,726 --> 00:18:26,761
Leonard, we can't
protect him forever.

408
00:18:26,763 --> 00:18:28,262
I know, but...

409
00:18:28,264 --> 00:18:29,830
He'll be okay.

410
00:18:29,832 --> 00:18:31,198
You taught him
well, Padawan.

411
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,900
Good Lord!

412
00:18:32,902 --> 00:18:36,637
Padawan's the student,
not the teacher.

413
00:18:38,206 --> 00:18:40,207
Seriously, let him go.

414
00:18:45,347 --> 00:18:47,648
Sheldon, if you really
need to do this,

415
00:18:47,650 --> 00:18:49,183
I'm not gonna
stand in your way.

416
00:18:49,185 --> 00:18:51,552
I do.

417
00:18:51,554 --> 00:18:54,255
Okay.

418
00:18:54,257 --> 00:18:55,856
Good luck.

419
00:18:59,895 --> 00:19:02,897
Be safe and call us.

420
00:19:05,067 --> 00:19:06,534
I will.

421
00:19:07,836 --> 00:19:10,004
Bye, buddy.

422
00:19:14,209 --> 00:19:15,443
Sheldon...

423
00:19:15,445 --> 00:19:17,511
Yes?

424
00:19:17,513 --> 00:19:20,181
I'm gonna miss you.

425
00:19:21,416 --> 00:19:23,717
Of course you are.

426
00:19:25,754 --> 00:19:28,689
He just made that easier.
Mm.

427
00:19:39,287 --> 00:19:41,453
Hey!

428
00:19:43,056 --> 00:19:45,324
What are you guys
still doing here?

429
00:19:45,326 --> 00:19:46,992
I got this, go. Go home.

430
00:19:48,562 --> 00:19:50,729
You sure?

431
00:19:51,765 --> 00:19:53,232
Yeah, she's fed,
she took her pills,

432
00:19:53,234 --> 00:19:54,634
she's all tucked in
and watching TV.

433
00:19:54,635 --> 00:19:56,869
So, she's not
too much for you?

434
00:19:56,871 --> 00:19:59,805
Are you kidding?
I love her, she's great.

435
00:19:59,807 --> 00:20:02,374
Stewie, you gonna watch

436
00:20:02,376 --> 00:20:04,043
<i>Wheel of Fortune</i> with me?

437
00:20:04,045 --> 00:20:06,312
Coming, Debbie.

438
00:20:07,781 --> 00:20:09,415
You call her Debbie?

439
00:20:09,417 --> 00:20:10,849
She insisted.

440
00:20:10,851 --> 00:20:13,485
So, hey, guys,
thank you so much.

441
00:20:13,487 --> 00:20:15,688
This job is a dream come true.

442
00:20:22,128 --> 00:20:24,196
Was that a little weird?

443
00:20:24,198 --> 00:20:26,065
Yeah. I don't know why,

444
00:20:26,067 --> 00:20:28,901
but something
about it feels...

445
00:20:28,903 --> 00:20:32,838
unnatural.

446
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:35,975
Okay, let's go.
Yep.

447
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:39,645
Okay, Sheldon,
thanks for checking in.

448
00:20:39,647 --> 00:20:41,580
Talk to you tomorrow?

449
00:20:41,582 --> 00:20:44,283
O-Okay, bye.

450
00:20:44,285 --> 00:20:45,818
He's okay?

451
00:20:45,820 --> 00:20:47,820
Actually sounds like
he's doing pretty well.

452
00:20:47,822 --> 00:20:50,322
I really think
this is gonna be for the best.

453
00:20:50,324 --> 00:20:51,757
Me, too.

454
00:20:51,759 --> 00:20:53,792
And he was able
to take a sabbatical from...

455
00:20:53,794 --> 00:20:55,698
How could you let him go?!
