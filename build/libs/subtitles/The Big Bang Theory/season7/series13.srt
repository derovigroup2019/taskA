<i>Previously on</i>
The Big Bang Theory:

2
00:00:03,030 --> 00:00:04,979
This is just a minor setback.

3
00:00:05,030 --> 00:00:06,146
No, it's not, okay?

4
00:00:06,148 --> 00:00:07,714
I've been out here
for, like, ten years.

5
00:00:07,716 --> 00:00:09,283
I have nothing to show for it.

6
00:00:09,285 --> 00:00:11,201
Well, you have me.

7
00:00:12,036 --> 00:00:14,404
I do have you.

8
00:00:19,527 --> 00:00:22,112
Leonard Hofstadter,

9
00:00:22,114 --> 00:00:24,715
will you marry me?

10
00:00:29,003 --> 00:00:32,389
Did you seriously
just say, "Um..."?

11
00:00:33,675 --> 00:00:35,342
It's an outrage.
I know.

12
00:00:35,344 --> 00:00:37,895
The university-- they think
they can do whatever they want.

13
00:00:37,897 --> 00:00:40,147
We just have to sit
there and take it.

14
00:00:40,149 --> 00:00:41,849
You need to let it go, Sheldon.

15
00:00:41,851 --> 00:00:44,601
You work tirelessly for someone,
and this is what you get.

16
00:00:44,603 --> 00:00:45,853
Oh, my God!

17
00:00:45,855 --> 00:00:48,355
They're just making you
use your vacation days!

18
00:00:48,357 --> 00:00:50,357
But I don't want
a vacation.

19
00:00:50,359 --> 00:00:53,093
Okay, listen,
I don't mean to diminish

20
00:00:53,095 --> 00:00:54,828
what you're going through,

21
00:00:54,830 --> 00:00:56,530
but I'm a little
distracted right now.

22
00:00:56,532 --> 00:00:58,315
Oh, this again? So,

23
00:00:58,317 --> 00:00:59,833
Penny proposed,
you didn't say yes,

24
00:00:59,835 --> 00:01:02,452
and now you think you may have
lost her love forever.

25
00:01:02,454 --> 00:01:04,487
How does this compare
to me being forced

26
00:01:04,489 --> 00:01:06,540
to relax for a few days?

27
00:01:08,459 --> 00:01:10,677
It doesn't!
Thank you!

28
00:01:12,764 --> 00:01:14,348
I'm gonna go
talk to Penny.

29
00:01:14,350 --> 00:01:17,217
I'm going to go inside,
put on my coziest pajamas,

30
00:01:17,219 --> 00:01:18,752
curl up with a good book

31
00:01:18,754 --> 00:01:21,805
and wait for this nightmare
to be over.

32
00:01:25,310 --> 00:01:28,111
Penny.

33
00:01:32,033 --> 00:01:34,234
Sorry.

34
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:37,512
Hi.
Hey.

35
00:01:37,513 --> 00:01:39,563
Look, I'm sorry
I didn't text you back.

36
00:01:39,041 --> 00:01:40,490
I just needed
some time to think.

37
00:01:40,492 --> 00:01:42,543
Okay.
Here. Come in.

38
00:01:42,545 --> 00:01:44,411
Look, if you want
to break up, just say it.

39
00:01:44,413 --> 00:01:46,213
Leonard...
No, no, no, no. I take it back.

40
00:01:46,215 --> 00:01:48,582
Don't say it. Just-just hate me,
but stay with me.

41
00:01:48,584 --> 00:01:50,133
It worked for my parents.

42
00:01:51,803 --> 00:01:54,788
Listen, I don't want
to break up with you.

43
00:01:54,790 --> 00:01:56,840
Oh. O-Okay.

44
00:01:56,842 --> 00:01:58,342
Good, good.

45
00:01:59,361 --> 00:02:01,595
So, it's cool if I cry a little?

46
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:04,481
Yeah, I probably wouldn't.

47
00:02:04,483 --> 00:02:07,034
Yeah.

48
00:02:08,137 --> 00:02:10,270
Look, you did the
right thing last night.

49
00:02:10,272 --> 00:02:11,672
I was a mess.

50
00:02:11,674 --> 00:02:14,424
I was just frustrated because
my career is going nowhere.

51
00:02:14,426 --> 00:02:16,559
Look, I get it,
and I want you to know

52
00:02:16,561 --> 00:02:18,695
that I support whatever
you want to do.

53
00:02:18,697 --> 00:02:19,997
Great, because
I've been thinking,

54
00:02:19,999 --> 00:02:21,949
if I really want this
acting thing to work,

55
00:02:21,951 --> 00:02:23,850
I need to focus all
my energy on it.

56
00:02:23,852 --> 00:02:25,152
And to do that,

57
00:02:25,154 --> 00:02:26,620
I should quit waitressing

58
00:02:26,622 --> 00:02:28,238
at The Cheesecake Factory.

59
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:29,957
Wow!

60
00:02:29,959 --> 00:02:31,625
That-That's a big step.

61
00:02:31,627 --> 00:02:33,327
I know.
So, you know,

62
00:02:33,329 --> 00:02:34,511
before making any rash...

63
00:02:34,513 --> 00:02:36,697
I already quit.
And I support you!

64
00:02:38,299 --> 00:02:41,935
? Our whole universe
was in a hot, dense state ?

65
00:02:41,937 --> 00:02:45,272
? Then nearly 14 billion years
ago expansion started... Wait! ?

66
00:02:45,274 --> 00:02:46,857
? The Earth began to cool

67
00:02:46,859 --> 00:02:49,443
? The autotrophs began to drool,
Neanderthals developed tools ?

68
00:02:49,445 --> 00:02:52,079
? We built the Wall
? <i>We built the pyramids</i> ?

69
00:02:52,081 --> 00:02:54,748
? Math, Science, History,
unraveling the mystery ?

70
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:56,599
? That all started
with a big bang ?

71
00:02:56,601 --> 00:02:58,652
? <i>Bang!</i> ?

Come on, take me
to work with you.

75
00:03:09,956 --> 00:03:11,689
No. You're on vacation.

76
00:03:11,691 --> 00:03:14,225
Please. What if there's a big
breakthrough in science today

77
00:03:14,227 --> 00:03:15,927
and I'm not
there to see it?

78
00:03:15,929 --> 00:03:17,462
Do you really think
there's gonna be a breakthrough

79
00:03:17,464 --> 00:03:18,663
without you there to do it?

80
00:03:18,665 --> 00:03:20,815
No. I was just tricking you.

81
00:03:20,817 --> 00:03:23,684
Bye.

82
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:26,437
Leonard, wait!

83
00:03:26,439 --> 00:03:28,088
Take me with you.

84
00:03:28,090 --> 00:03:29,724
No!

85
00:03:29,726 --> 00:03:31,091
Please.
No!

86
00:03:31,093 --> 00:03:32,426
Too bad. I'm coming with you.

87
00:03:32,428 --> 00:03:33,945
Oh, Sheldon, stay!
But...

88
00:03:33,947 --> 00:03:36,114
I said stay!

89
00:03:41,954 --> 00:03:43,955
I'm going to work.

90
00:03:43,957 --> 00:03:46,157
Do not follow me.

00:04:04,827 --> 00:04:06,677
Hey, Stuart.

93
00:04:07,696 --> 00:04:10,314
Hey.
Sorry. Did I startle you?

94
00:04:10,316 --> 00:04:13,851
Yes, but at this point,
pretty much any customer does.

95
00:04:13,853 --> 00:04:15,553
What can I do for you?

96
00:04:15,555 --> 00:04:17,304
Well, I need a little help.

97
00:04:17,306 --> 00:04:18,806
I accidentally destroyed
one of Howard's

98
00:04:18,808 --> 00:04:19,991
comic books this morning,

99
00:04:19,993 --> 00:04:21,475
and was hoping
I could replace it.

100
00:04:21,477 --> 00:04:22,894
Wow. What happened?

101
00:04:22,896 --> 00:04:26,447
Batman got his ass kicked
by my curling iron.

102
00:04:26,449 --> 00:04:30,017
Well, don't let
The Riddler know that.

103
00:04:30,686 --> 00:04:33,855
It's a comic book joke.

104
00:04:34,523 --> 00:04:36,757
Or maybe it's not.

105
00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:39,010
Do you have this one?

106
00:04:39,012 --> 00:04:40,795
Uh, well, it's-it's
pretty rare.

107
00:04:40,797 --> 00:04:43,047
Can you give me a few
days to track it down?

108
00:04:43,049 --> 00:04:44,966
Ooh, I was kind of
hoping to get it

109
00:04:44,968 --> 00:04:47,268
before Howie comes home from work.
Oh. What's the hurry?

110
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:48,553
Well, he's always saying

111
00:04:48,555 --> 00:04:50,438
I should be more careful
with my curling iron,

112
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:51,889
and it seems like
a dangerous precedent

113
00:04:51,891 --> 00:04:54,058
to let him think
he can be right.

114
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:56,394
Well, I'll do what I can,

115
00:04:56,396 --> 00:04:58,546
but I can't make
any promises.

116
00:04:58,548 --> 00:05:02,400
You know, I do work
at a pharmaceutical company.

117
00:05:02,402 --> 00:05:04,619
If you can make this
happen today,

118
00:05:04,621 --> 00:05:07,872
I can hook you up with anxiety
medication, antidepressants.

119
00:05:07,874 --> 00:05:09,707
Really?

120
00:05:11,326 --> 00:05:13,711
Do you have
any of these?

121
00:05:17,966 --> 00:05:20,534
Hello, Mr. Rat Brain.

122
00:05:21,553 --> 00:05:24,005
Not so bitey
without the rest of the rat

123
00:05:24,007 --> 00:05:25,673
to back us up now, are we?

124
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:28,208
Anybody home?

125
00:05:28,210 --> 00:05:29,227
Hey, what brings
you guys here?

126
00:05:29,229 --> 00:05:30,328
Well, we were
just on our way

127
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:31,345
to lunch and wanted to see

128
00:05:31,347 --> 00:05:32,430
if you'd like to join.

129
00:05:32,432 --> 00:05:33,564
Why?

130
00:05:33,566 --> 00:05:34,882
Because Sheldon's
not here this week,

131
00:05:34,884 --> 00:05:36,517
and you don't think
I have any other options?

132
00:05:36,519 --> 00:05:38,686
I'm just kidding.
I'll get my purse.

133
00:05:38,688 --> 00:05:41,239
Hi, Amy. I... Oh.

134
00:05:41,241 --> 00:05:43,257
I'm soy. I didn't know
you had any company.

135
00:05:43,259 --> 00:05:44,358
That's okay.

136
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:45,726
Uh, Bert,
this is Howard and Rajesh.

137
00:05:45,728 --> 00:05:46,978
Guys, this is Bert.

138
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:48,162
Hey. Good to see you.
Hey.

139
00:05:48,164 --> 00:05:49,664
Anyway, I wanted to show you

140
00:05:49,666 --> 00:05:52,083
this tourmalinated quartz
that we got in the lab.

141
00:05:52,085 --> 00:05:53,868
This is so pretty.

142
00:05:53,870 --> 00:05:55,753
Bert works for the
geology department.

143
00:05:55,755 --> 00:05:57,838
Yeah. You know what,
uh, geologists

144
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,590
and Bon Jovi have in common?

145
00:05:59,592 --> 00:06:01,909
You're both
into rock?

146
00:06:03,712 --> 00:06:06,113
Yeah.

147
00:06:07,599 --> 00:06:09,934
Well, see ya.

148
00:06:09,936 --> 00:06:11,102
Oh, you forgot your quartz.

149
00:06:11,104 --> 00:06:12,803
Oh, it's okay.

150
00:06:12,805 --> 00:06:14,639
I want you to have it.

151
00:06:15,607 --> 00:06:17,008
Bye.

152
00:06:17,010 --> 00:06:18,392
He's nice.

153
00:06:18,394 --> 00:06:21,846
Yeah, he's nice
because he likes you.

154
00:06:21,848 --> 00:06:24,398
What?! No, he doesn't.

155
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,117
He brought you
a pretty rock.

156
00:06:26,119 --> 00:06:27,818
So? He does that every day...

157
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:29,487
Oh.

158
00:06:29,489 --> 00:06:31,822
You know, if you'd
rather skip lunch

159
00:06:31,824 --> 00:06:34,525
and hang out with your boyfriend
Bert, it's totally okay.

160
00:06:34,527 --> 00:06:36,160
He's not my boyfriend.

161
00:06:36,162 --> 00:06:38,245
Are you sure? He's tall,
pale and awkward.

162
00:06:38,247 --> 00:06:40,331
That sounds like your type.

163
00:06:40,333 --> 00:06:43,734
Should someone as lonely as you
really be making fun of me?

164
00:06:43,736 --> 00:06:45,553
Yeah, grow up, Howard. God.

165
00:06:47,172 --> 00:06:49,957
What do I do? I don't want
to hurt his feelings.

166
00:06:49,959 --> 00:06:52,393
Maybe the problem is
he thinks you're available.

167
00:06:52,395 --> 00:06:54,095
Does he know
you're dating Sheldon?

168
00:06:54,097 --> 00:06:56,430
I guess it hasn't come up.

169
00:06:56,432 --> 00:06:58,482
There you go.

170
00:06:58,484 --> 00:07:01,152
And does Sheldon know
you're dating Sheldon?

171
00:07:03,021 --> 00:07:06,040
I'm sorry. Who are <i>you</i> dating?

172
00:07:06,042 --> 00:07:08,242
Yeah, knock it off, Howard!

173
00:07:17,670 --> 00:07:19,370
Oh. Hey, Sheldon.

174
00:07:19,372 --> 00:07:21,038
Hello.

175
00:07:26,595 --> 00:07:28,629
You okay?

176
00:07:28,631 --> 00:07:30,715
I'm on vacation.

177
00:07:30,717 --> 00:07:32,967
What do you think?

178
00:07:32,969 --> 00:07:35,502
Why are you sitting
in the stairwell?

179
00:07:36,504 --> 00:07:38,672
Leonard told me to stay.

180
00:07:39,758 --> 00:07:43,177
Oh. Well, good boy.

181
00:07:43,179 --> 00:07:45,345
Where are you going?

182
00:07:45,347 --> 00:07:46,697
Oh, I have a ton
of errands to run.

183
00:07:46,699 --> 00:07:48,015
I need to make copies
of my headshot,

184
00:07:48,017 --> 00:07:49,150
send them off to agents

185
00:07:49,152 --> 00:07:50,735
and sign up
for a new acting class and...

186
00:07:50,737 --> 00:07:52,536
Well, have fun.

187
00:07:52,538 --> 00:07:54,522
Okay.

188
00:07:59,077 --> 00:08:01,112
You want to come with me?

189
00:08:01,114 --> 00:08:03,530
Really?

190
00:08:03,532 --> 00:08:06,250
Come on, boy. Come on.
Let's go. Let's go.

191
00:08:06,252 --> 00:08:09,303
Get in the car. Come on.

192
00:08:10,505 --> 00:08:13,090
All right, thanks a lot.

193
00:08:13,092 --> 00:08:14,842
They have one at
Capital Comics.

194
00:08:14,844 --> 00:08:16,794
Oh, that's great.
No, it's not.

195
00:08:16,796 --> 00:08:18,378
I hate that place.

196
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:20,431
Guy who owns it is a jerk.

197
00:08:20,433 --> 00:08:22,750
He's always making me
feel bad about myself.

198
00:08:22,752 --> 00:08:25,152
Oh, that's terrible.

199
00:08:25,154 --> 00:08:27,054
What's the address?

200
00:08:27,056 --> 00:08:29,056
You know, why don't
I just take you there?

201
00:08:29,058 --> 00:08:31,559
That way, I can make sure
he doesn't rip you off.

202
00:08:31,561 --> 00:08:33,244
Oh, thanks, but I don't
want you to close up.

203
00:08:33,246 --> 00:08:34,578
I mean, won't you lose business?

204
00:08:37,432 --> 00:08:39,750
Sorry. That was mean.

205
00:08:43,705 --> 00:08:45,773
Penny really quit
The Cheesecake Factory?

206
00:08:45,798 --> 00:08:46,258
Yeah.

207
00:08:46,259 --> 00:08:48,575
So, what is she doing today?
I don't know.

208
00:08:48,577 --> 00:08:50,044
She already thinks
I don't support this,

209
00:08:50,046 --> 00:08:52,680
so if I call, it might look like
I'm checking up on her.

210
00:08:52,682 --> 00:08:53,831
Well, do you support this?

211
00:08:53,833 --> 00:08:55,299
Of course I do.

212
00:08:55,301 --> 00:08:56,550
She's a great actress.

213
00:08:56,552 --> 00:08:58,252
I'm proud she's
taking this risk.

214
00:08:58,254 --> 00:08:59,770
That's nice.

215
00:08:59,772 --> 00:09:01,939
You bought that? Great!

216
00:09:04,576 --> 00:09:07,895
I got to call her before
I forget how I said it.

217
00:09:07,897 --> 00:09:09,847
Hey.

218
00:09:09,849 --> 00:09:10,865
Hi. What's up?

219
00:09:10,867 --> 00:09:11,849
Oh, how's it going?

220
00:09:11,851 --> 00:09:13,234
You taking Hollywood by storm?

221
00:09:13,236 --> 00:09:15,102
Actually,
I'm at The Cheesecake Factory.

222
00:09:15,104 --> 00:09:17,288
You got your job back.
That is great news.

223
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:19,073
I didn't want
to say anything,

224
00:09:19,075 --> 00:09:20,574
but you are making
the right choice.

225
00:09:20,576 --> 00:09:21,625
To plunge yourself into debt

226
00:09:21,627 --> 00:09:22,943
right now would be
literally insane.

227
00:09:22,945 --> 00:09:24,128
Yeah.

228
00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:26,831
I'm just returning my uniform.

229
00:09:29,151 --> 00:09:31,669
And I support you.

230
00:09:40,330 --> 00:09:42,964
Before we begin
your guided meditation,

231
00:09:42,966 --> 00:09:44,332
close your eyes

232
00:09:44,334 --> 00:09:47,135
and picture yourself
in a peaceful environment.

233
00:09:47,137 --> 00:09:49,404
Okay.

234
00:09:50,773 --> 00:09:54,609
I'm inside
the CERN super collider.

235
00:09:55,411 --> 00:09:57,545
Now, take a deep,
relaxing breath

236
00:09:57,547 --> 00:09:59,114
in through your nose.

237
00:10:01,184 --> 00:10:03,134
And let it out.

238
00:10:03,136 --> 00:10:05,437
Wow. Didn't see that coming.

239
00:10:06,805 --> 00:10:08,273
In.

240
00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:11,642
Let me guess.

241
00:10:11,644 --> 00:10:13,361
And out.

242
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:17,332
What was I gonna do?
Two "ins" in a row?

243
00:10:21,470 --> 00:10:23,304
Where's my lemonade?

244
00:10:23,306 --> 00:10:24,873
I didn't get it.

245
00:10:24,875 --> 00:10:27,876
A fitting swan song
to your career as a waitress

246
00:10:27,878 --> 00:10:30,795
to forget my order
one last time.

247
00:10:36,002 --> 00:10:39,354
Do you think quitting
my job was a mistake?

248
00:10:39,356 --> 00:10:42,474
Do you see me drinking lemonade?

249
00:10:43,342 --> 00:10:45,727
No. I'm serious.

250
00:10:45,729 --> 00:10:47,312
Why do you ask?

251
00:10:47,314 --> 00:10:49,514
Because Leonard
just pissed me off.

252
00:10:49,516 --> 00:10:51,682
Am I being an idiot or not?

253
00:10:51,684 --> 00:10:54,152
No, I don't think you are.

254
00:10:54,154 --> 00:10:55,520
Really?

255
00:10:55,522 --> 00:10:58,456
The best way to achieve a goal
is to devote 100%

256
00:10:58,458 --> 00:11:00,458
of your time and energy to it.

257
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:02,794
When I decided I was going
to be a physicist,

258
00:11:02,796 --> 00:11:04,195
I didn't take
some other job

259
00:11:04,197 --> 00:11:06,331
in case it didn't work out.

260
00:11:06,333 --> 00:11:08,533
Which wasn't easy because
there was a lot of pressure

261
00:11:08,535 --> 00:11:11,536
from Ms. Pierson for me
to be chalk monitor that year.

262
00:11:12,304 --> 00:11:15,507
Thank you.
I needed to hear that.

263
00:11:15,509 --> 00:11:17,708
Why can't Leonard understand it?

264
00:11:18,978 --> 00:11:21,262
Because he's not
like us, Penny.

265
00:11:21,264 --> 00:11:23,548
We're dreamers.

266
00:11:25,484 --> 00:11:27,268
Yeah, I need to start
cracking the window

267
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:29,220
when I leave you in the car.

268
00:11:35,494 --> 00:11:37,512
Hey.

269
00:11:37,514 --> 00:11:38,830
Hello, Bert.

270
00:11:38,832 --> 00:11:40,782
So, anyway,
there's this big, uh,

271
00:11:40,784 --> 00:11:42,700
rock and mineral show next week

272
00:11:42,702 --> 00:11:44,402
in Santa Monica and...
Listen,

273
00:11:44,404 --> 00:11:47,805
um, Bert, before you say
anything else, I...

274
00:11:47,807 --> 00:11:49,824
I have a boyfriend.

275
00:11:49,826 --> 00:11:52,210
Oh. This is awkward.

276
00:11:52,212 --> 00:11:54,679
You thought I was gonna ask you
to go with me

277
00:11:54,681 --> 00:11:55,930
to the mineral show.

278
00:11:55,932 --> 00:11:57,448
Weren't you?

279
00:11:58,284 --> 00:12:01,553
Yeah.

280
00:12:01,555 --> 00:12:04,272
That's very nice
of you, but...

281
00:12:04,274 --> 00:12:06,574
I do have a boyfriend.

282
00:12:06,576 --> 00:12:07,809
That's what you all say.

283
00:12:07,811 --> 00:12:09,694
You just don't want
to go out with me

284
00:12:09,696 --> 00:12:11,279
because I have
an off-putting personality.

285
00:12:11,281 --> 00:12:13,114
No, that's not true.

286
00:12:13,116 --> 00:12:15,450
My boyfriend has
an off-putting personality, too.

287
00:12:15,452 --> 00:12:17,785
Like, way worse than you.

288
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:20,538
Don't worry.

289
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:21,772
I'm used to it.

290
00:12:21,774 --> 00:12:24,993
I mean, I'm big and weird
and funny-looking

291
00:12:24,995 --> 00:12:27,879
and no one ever wants
to do anything with me.

292
00:12:27,881 --> 00:12:30,114
Don't say that.

293
00:12:30,116 --> 00:12:32,467
It's okay.

294
00:12:32,469 --> 00:12:34,235
I know I'm a monster.

295
00:12:34,237 --> 00:12:35,786
No, Bert, come on.

296
00:12:35,788 --> 00:12:38,790
I'd love to go
to the mineral show with you.

297
00:12:38,792 --> 00:12:40,291
Sweet.

298
00:12:40,293 --> 00:12:42,260
It's a date.

299
00:12:44,563 --> 00:12:45,930
No, it's not.

300
00:12:45,932 --> 00:12:47,432
Too late!

301
00:12:55,457 --> 00:12:57,659
Wow.

302
00:12:58,827 --> 00:13:01,496
Yeah. Haven't seen
this many people in my store

303
00:13:01,498 --> 00:13:05,516
since that Korean church bus
crashed through my front window.

304
00:13:05,518 --> 00:13:07,869
Hey! Stuart!

305
00:13:07,871 --> 00:13:08,937
Jesse.

306
00:13:08,939 --> 00:13:10,672
Haven't seen
you in forever.

307
00:13:10,674 --> 00:13:12,173
Look how gray you've gotten.

308
00:13:12,175 --> 00:13:14,642
My hair's exactly
the same color as always.

309
00:13:14,644 --> 00:13:17,111
No, I was talking
about your skin.

310
00:13:17,113 --> 00:13:20,582
Look, uh, my friend here needs
a comic book...

311
00:13:20,584 --> 00:13:22,717
Ooh! And she went
into your store by mistake.

312
00:13:22,719 --> 00:13:25,303
Good thing there was no one
there to see you.

313
00:13:26,272 --> 00:13:28,273
What do you need?

314
00:13:28,275 --> 00:13:29,524
Oh, yeah, yeah. I got this.

315
00:13:29,526 --> 00:13:30,692
Right over here.

316
00:13:33,679 --> 00:13:35,630
Even you, Sweatpants?

317
00:13:35,632 --> 00:13:37,949
Free popcorn.

318
00:13:39,051 --> 00:13:40,918
Can I offer you
a coffee?

319
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:42,287
Espresso? Latte?

320
00:13:42,289 --> 00:13:43,321
No, thanks.

321
00:13:43,323 --> 00:13:45,523
How about you, Stu?
Mocha? Scone?

322
00:13:45,525 --> 00:13:48,126
Directions
to the nearest soup kitchen?

323
00:13:48,128 --> 00:13:49,460
Hey.

324
00:13:49,462 --> 00:13:50,495
I'm just kidding.

325
00:13:50,497 --> 00:13:52,830
He knows
where the soup kitchen is.

326
00:13:54,633 --> 00:13:56,668
It's on Merton Avenue.

327
00:13:58,304 --> 00:14:00,722
I don't think I like the way
you're treating my friend.

328
00:14:00,724 --> 00:14:01,889
Sorry.

329
00:14:01,891 --> 00:14:03,625
You want the book or not?

330
00:14:03,627 --> 00:14:04,642
Not from you.

331
00:14:04,644 --> 00:14:06,761
Let's go, Stuart.

332
00:14:09,982 --> 00:14:11,549
You know something, Jesse?

333
00:14:11,551 --> 00:14:13,851
You may have
a successful business

334
00:14:13,853 --> 00:14:15,687
a-and the kind
of pink complexion

335
00:14:15,689 --> 00:14:18,039
that comes
with good nutrition...

336
00:14:19,008 --> 00:14:21,159
...but I have something
more important.

337
00:14:21,161 --> 00:14:22,393
What's that?

338
00:14:22,395 --> 00:14:24,579
Friendship.

339
00:14:26,949 --> 00:14:30,752
Which I would trade
in a heartbeat for all of this.

340
00:14:33,439 --> 00:14:35,957
The mineral and rock show?

341
00:14:35,959 --> 00:14:39,927
That would be awful
even without Bert.

342
00:14:39,929 --> 00:14:41,879
So what am I supposed to do now?

343
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:45,082
Prepare your uterus
for his gigantic offspring?

344
00:14:47,536 --> 00:14:49,053
This isn't funny.

345
00:14:49,055 --> 00:14:50,755
I'm gonna have
to tell him the truth:

346
00:14:50,757 --> 00:14:52,473
that even if I didn't have
a boyfriend,

347
00:14:52,475 --> 00:14:53,775
I wouldn't be interested in him.

348
00:14:53,777 --> 00:14:55,926
I've heard those words
so many times.

349
00:14:55,928 --> 00:14:58,446
From Linda Nosenchuck,
Tammy Rosenworcel...

350
00:14:58,448 --> 00:14:59,981
Padma Kapur, Neha Chowdury...

351
00:14:59,983 --> 00:15:02,033
...Marci Grossman,
Lisa Mazzarino...

352
00:15:02,035 --> 00:15:03,651
...Megan Pincus...
...Tammy Cho...

353
00:15:03,653 --> 00:15:05,186
Oh, who was that girl
from our Starbucks?

354
00:15:05,188 --> 00:15:07,572
Arlene Russel!
Yes! Arlene!

355
00:15:07,574 --> 00:15:13,211
She wrote "no way"
on both our cappuccinos.

356
00:15:13,213 --> 00:15:14,629
Poor Bert.

357
00:15:14,631 --> 00:15:16,831
That guy's got a rough
afternoon ahead of him.

358
00:15:16,833 --> 00:15:18,916
Well, how would
you want a girl

359
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:20,768
to tell you she
wasn't interested?

360
00:15:20,770 --> 00:15:23,638
I guess, uh, I'd like her
to sit me down,

361
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:25,640
look me in the eye and say,

362
00:15:25,642 --> 00:15:28,760
"I was wrong. I love you."

363
00:15:28,762 --> 00:15:29,744
And then maybe

364
00:15:29,746 --> 00:15:32,397
she could touch me
in a special way.

365
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:36,467
That's how you
reject a guy.

366
00:15:36,469 --> 00:15:37,902
Okay, I don't have time
for this.

367
00:15:37,904 --> 00:15:40,438
I'm just gonna go find him
and be brutally honest.

368
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:41,789
No, don't.
He'll be so upset.

369
00:15:41,791 --> 00:15:43,641
He'll probably climb up
the Empire State Building

370
00:15:43,643 --> 00:15:46,110
and start swatting
at planes.

371
00:15:50,382 --> 00:15:52,216
You want us to
talk to him?

372
00:15:52,218 --> 00:15:53,234
Really?

373
00:15:53,236 --> 00:15:54,569
You would do that?

374
00:15:54,571 --> 00:15:56,087
Sure. We've both been
in his shoes.

375
00:15:56,089 --> 00:15:58,740
We'll let him down
with compassion and respect.

376
00:15:58,742 --> 00:16:00,525
Thank you.

377
00:16:00,527 --> 00:16:02,510
Let's go.

378
00:16:03,662 --> 00:16:05,663
So we tell him
she's a lesbian, right?

379
00:16:05,665 --> 00:16:08,616
Of course we tell
him she's a lesbian.

380
00:16:15,657 --> 00:16:18,059
And hold three...

381
00:16:18,061 --> 00:16:20,561
two... one.

382
00:16:20,563 --> 00:16:22,096
Very good.

383
00:16:22,098 --> 00:16:26,317
Now let's try
Warrior II.

384
00:16:27,152 --> 00:16:29,303
And hold.

385
00:16:32,090 --> 00:16:35,192
I've read that there are great
yogis who have such mastery

386
00:16:35,194 --> 00:16:40,081
over their bodies they can draw
water in through their genitals.

387
00:16:47,723 --> 00:16:51,926
Yeah, well, I don't think we're
gonna get to do that today.

388
00:16:51,928 --> 00:16:54,228
Too bad.

389
00:16:54,230 --> 00:16:56,564
It seems like a good way
to drink a milk shake

390
00:16:56,566 --> 00:16:59,317
without getting
brain freeze.

391
00:17:00,936 --> 00:17:02,687
Oh, hey.

392
00:17:02,689 --> 00:17:04,238
And now we go
to Reverse Warrior.

393
00:17:09,361 --> 00:17:11,579
How did she get you to do yoga?

394
00:17:11,581 --> 00:17:16,233
Well, to be honest,
I thought she said "Yoda."

395
00:17:18,420 --> 00:17:22,707
I'm helping him relax because,
unlike you, he supports me.

396
00:17:22,709 --> 00:17:25,176
Oh, how many times
do I have to say it?

397
00:17:25,178 --> 00:17:26,544
I support you.

398
00:17:26,546 --> 00:17:28,078
Sheldon, take a break.

399
00:17:28,881 --> 00:17:30,381
<i>Namaste.</i>

400
00:17:32,367 --> 00:17:35,052
Okay, if you support me,
what was with that phone call?

401
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:37,471
Fine. I'm not sure
you should have quit.

402
00:17:37,473 --> 00:17:39,390
But if you care so much
what I think,

403
00:17:39,392 --> 00:17:41,309
why didn't you ask me
before you did it?

404
00:17:41,311 --> 00:17:42,727
Oh, so now I need
your permission?

405
00:17:42,729 --> 00:17:44,679
Would you have asked me
before you quit your job?

406
00:17:44,681 --> 00:17:47,565
Yes. I thought we were
in the kind of relationship

407
00:17:47,567 --> 00:17:48,900
where we make
decisions together.

408
00:17:48,902 --> 00:17:51,035
If I'm wrong,
then maybe we need to talk

409
00:17:51,037 --> 00:17:53,154
about the kind of relationship
we're actually in.

410
00:17:53,156 --> 00:17:54,255
Yeah, well, maybe we do.

411
00:17:54,257 --> 00:17:56,908
I'm willing to if you guys are.

412
00:17:57,743 --> 00:17:59,427
Can we please
have some privacy?

413
00:17:59,429 --> 00:18:00,711
Y... No.

414
00:18:00,713 --> 00:18:02,830
I'm as much a part
of this relationship as you two,

415
00:18:02,832 --> 00:18:05,449
and I think it's high time we
put all our cards on the table.

416
00:18:05,451 --> 00:18:07,802
Yeah. For example,
where is this going?

417
00:18:07,804 --> 00:18:10,021
Are you two ever
getting married?

418
00:18:10,023 --> 00:18:12,256
And, if so,
where will we all live?

419
00:18:12,258 --> 00:18:14,308
Have you thought about that?

420
00:18:14,310 --> 00:18:16,377
No.
Penny?

421
00:18:16,379 --> 00:18:17,645
Okay, wait. What
are we doing?

422
00:18:17,647 --> 00:18:19,129
For some reason,

423
00:18:19,131 --> 00:18:22,149
we're planning a future where we
both live with Sheldon forever.

424
00:18:22,151 --> 00:18:24,151
Good.
Now we're getting somewhere.

425
00:18:24,153 --> 00:18:26,454
Look, I know you think

426
00:18:26,456 --> 00:18:28,239
I'm being reckless,
and you might be right,

427
00:18:28,241 --> 00:18:29,907
but I need to take this shot.

428
00:18:29,909 --> 00:18:30,858
Yeah, no kidding.

429
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:32,526
Despite what it says
on her r?sum?,

430
00:18:32,528 --> 00:18:34,144
she is no longer 22.

431
00:18:37,432 --> 00:18:40,468
I swear, I am on your side.

432
00:18:40,470 --> 00:18:42,152
You keep saying
you’re on my side,

433
00:18:42,154 --> 00:18:43,621
but you don't act like it.

434
00:18:43,623 --> 00:18:44,922
He does that to me, too.

435
00:18:44,924 --> 00:18:46,674
Why do we put up with it?

436
00:18:47,759 --> 00:18:50,845
Listen, I could never do
what you're doing, okay?

437
00:18:50,847 --> 00:18:52,413
I would be terrified.

438
00:18:52,415 --> 00:18:54,215
Well, it's scary for me, too.

439
00:18:54,217 --> 00:18:56,333
I'm fine with it.

440
00:18:57,986 --> 00:19:00,137
My point is, just because
I couldn't do it

441
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:01,472
doesn't mean you shouldn't.

442
00:19:01,474 --> 00:19:04,058
And I'm proud of you.

443
00:19:05,728 --> 00:19:08,029
Okay. Thank you.

444
00:19:09,131 --> 00:19:10,998
Well, to celebrate
this reconciliation,

445
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,700
let's all share a milk shake.

446
00:19:12,702 --> 00:19:15,569
Uh, Penny, you'll need a straw.

447
00:19:21,043 --> 00:19:22,026
You're back.

448
00:19:22,028 --> 00:19:23,294
Yes, I am!

449
00:19:23,296 --> 00:19:25,379
There's a few more things
I want to say to you.

450
00:19:25,381 --> 00:19:26,631
Stuart's store is just fine,

451
00:19:26,633 --> 00:19:28,249
and he's a much nicer person
than you are,

452
00:19:28,251 --> 00:19:29,717
and if you still have
that comic,

453
00:19:29,719 --> 00:19:32,336
I'd like to buy it right now!

454
00:19:32,338 --> 00:19:33,554
No problem.

455
00:19:33,556 --> 00:19:36,190
Oh, you want a latte
while you wait?

456
00:19:36,192 --> 00:19:38,009
No, I don't want a latte!

457
00:19:38,011 --> 00:19:40,945
I want a cappuccino
and a blueberry scone!

458
00:19:40,947 --> 00:19:43,080
I only have chocolate chip.

459
00:19:43,082 --> 00:19:46,350
Well, that sounds even better!

460
00:19:54,807 --> 00:19:57,976
Thanks for coming to the mineral
and rock show with me.

461
00:20:00,964 --> 00:20:04,199
We're sorry Amy
didn't want to go.

462
00:20:04,201 --> 00:20:08,087
Really, <i>really</i> sorry.

463
00:20:08,089 --> 00:20:09,321
Eh.

464
00:20:09,323 --> 00:20:11,340
Who needs her when
I have you guys?

465
00:20:11,342 --> 00:20:13,075
Rock show!

466
00:20:13,077 --> 00:20:15,044
Rock show!
Rock show!

467
00:20:15,046 --> 00:20:17,429
Rock show! Rock show!

468
00:20:17,431 --> 00:20:20,866
Rock show!
Rock show...!
