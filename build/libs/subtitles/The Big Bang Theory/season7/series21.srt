1
00:00:02,084 --> 00:00:03,885
So, we're about to shoot
this scene in the movie

2
00:00:03,887 --> 00:00:07,155
where the killer ape DNA
is slowly taking over my body.

3
00:00:07,157 --> 00:00:08,456
Okay.

4
00:00:08,458 --> 00:00:11,059
But I realize
they're gluing fur everywhere,

5
00:00:11,061 --> 00:00:12,193
except my cleavage.

6
00:00:12,195 --> 00:00:14,095
So, I asked
the director why

7
00:00:14,097 --> 00:00:16,364
and he says, it's important
to the story that my boobs

8
00:00:16,366 --> 00:00:18,833
be the last things to turn ape.

9
00:00:21,504 --> 00:00:24,506
It's sweet that he thinks
there's a story.

10
00:00:24,508 --> 00:00:27,141
Oh, and there's not even
a bathroom on set.

11
00:00:27,143 --> 00:00:29,410
I have to go to the gas station
across the street.

12
00:00:29,412 --> 00:00:31,346
I mean, I was dressed like
half an ape

13
00:00:31,348 --> 00:00:34,408
and still not even close to the
most disgusting person in there.

14
00:00:35,505 --> 00:00:37,163
Leonard, I could use
your assistance.

15
00:00:37,188 --> 00:00:38,387
Sure. What's up?

16
00:00:38,388 --> 00:00:39,988
Well, now that I've given up
string theory,

17
00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:42,323
I'm struggling to find
my next area of focus.

18
00:00:42,325 --> 00:00:44,459
So, in your
professional opinion,

19
00:00:44,461 --> 00:00:46,327
which of these areas
do you think

20
00:00:46,329 --> 00:00:47,428
is the most promising?

21
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:49,697
Huh, well, I-I think
there's some

22
00:00:49,699 --> 00:00:52,133
really innovative stuff
going on in dark matter.

23
00:00:52,135 --> 00:00:53,801
That's helpful.

24
00:00:56,639 --> 00:00:58,540
Okay. Of these four areas...

25
00:00:58,542 --> 00:00:59,674
PENNY:
Sheldon!

26
00:00:59,676 --> 00:01:01,376
What did we say about
being a nicer friend?

27
00:01:01,378 --> 00:01:02,777
Thank you.

28
00:01:02,779 --> 00:01:05,880
Leonard, what did we say about
being a gullible weenie?

29
00:01:07,182 --> 00:01:09,017
It is just so frustrating.
PENNY: 'Cause you're

30
00:01:09,019 --> 00:01:10,618
trying too hard.
You need to do something else.

31
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:11,920
Get your mind off it.

32
00:01:11,922 --> 00:01:15,390
Hey. How about we bring back
Anything Can Happen Thursdays?

33
00:01:15,392 --> 00:01:17,025
Hey, that's good.
Why'd you guys stop doing that?

34
00:01:17,027 --> 00:01:19,260
You made fun of us.
Said it was stupid.

35
00:01:20,229 --> 00:01:21,696
Yeah. Sounds like me.

36
00:01:22,665 --> 00:01:23,932
Come on, Sheldon.
What do you say?

37
00:01:23,934 --> 00:01:26,834
All right.
I officially reinstate

38
00:01:26,836 --> 00:01:28,169
Anything Can Happen Thursday.

39
00:01:28,171 --> 00:01:30,138
Great! What do,
what do you want to do?

40
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:31,472
(Sheldon and Penny sigh)

41
00:01:31,474 --> 00:01:32,840
I don't know.

42
00:01:32,842 --> 00:01:34,042
What do you want to do?

43
00:01:34,044 --> 00:01:36,144
I don't know.
What do you want to do?

44
00:01:36,146 --> 00:01:38,713
I'm starting to remember
the problem with

45
00:01:38,715 --> 00:01:40,248
Anything Can Happen Thursdays.

46
00:01:41,317 --> 00:01:44,452
? Our whole universe
was in a hot, dense state ?

47
00:01:44,454 --> 00:01:47,989
? Then nearly 14 billion years
ago expansion started... Wait! ?

48
00:01:47,991 --> 00:01:49,624
? The Earth began to cool

49
00:01:49,626 --> 00:01:52,527
? The autotrophs began to drool,
Neanderthals developed tools ?

50
00:01:52,529 --> 00:01:54,696
? We built the Wall
? <i>We built the pyramids</i> ?

51
00:01:54,698 --> 00:01:57,465
? Math, Science, History,
unraveling the mystery ?

52
00:01:57,467 --> 00:01:59,400
? That all started
with a big bang ?

53
00:01:59,402 --> 00:02:01,369
? <i>Bang!</i> ?

00:02:10,453 --> 00:02:12,187
Hmm...

57
00:02:12,189 --> 00:02:14,689
what could we do that's fun?

58
00:02:14,691 --> 00:02:16,558
What could we do
that's different?

59
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:19,928
What could we do that's free?

60
00:02:21,130 --> 00:02:22,431
(gasps) Got it!

61
00:02:22,433 --> 00:02:24,499
We order a pizza.

62
00:02:24,501 --> 00:02:26,334
Are you kidding?
That's what you always do.

63
00:02:26,336 --> 00:02:27,302
Think harder.

64
00:02:27,304 --> 00:02:29,304
You're right.
You're right.

65
00:02:29,306 --> 00:02:30,439
(gasps) Got it!

66
00:02:30,441 --> 00:02:33,075
We order calzones,
cut them open,

67
00:02:33,077 --> 00:02:35,143
eat them like pizza.

68
00:02:36,245 --> 00:02:37,679
All right! All right!
I'll shake the brain bush

69
00:02:37,681 --> 00:02:39,414
one more time,
see what falls out.

70
00:02:40,483 --> 00:02:41,650
(gasps) Got it!

71
00:02:41,652 --> 00:02:44,286
There's a live-action
role-playing group

72
00:02:44,288 --> 00:02:46,021
that meets every Thursday night
in Griffith Park

73
00:02:46,023 --> 00:02:49,257
and reenacts battles from
<i>Lord of the Rings.</i>

74
00:02:49,259 --> 00:02:52,894
Uh, tell me more
about this calzone idea.

75
00:02:54,063 --> 00:02:55,163
You know what?

76
00:02:55,165 --> 00:02:56,498
Why don't we just
ease into this.

77
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:57,999
Let-Let's go for a walk

78
00:02:58,001 --> 00:03:00,635
and-and-and see if
we find a new restaurant.

79
00:03:00,637 --> 00:03:04,106
Any chance that restaurant
is near Griffith Park?

80
00:03:06,676 --> 00:03:07,843
LEONARD:
No.

81
00:03:07,845 --> 00:03:10,378
All right.

82
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:12,447
Raj and Howard
are at Howard's mom's,

83
00:03:12,449 --> 00:03:14,282
but should we call the girls
and see if they want to come?

84
00:03:14,284 --> 00:03:15,650
No. Bernadette's
working late.

85
00:03:15,652 --> 00:03:16,818
Amy's sick.

86
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:17,886
Aw. What's wrong with her?

87
00:03:17,888 --> 00:03:19,454
Well, she talks a lot.

88
00:03:19,456 --> 00:03:21,356
She always wants to hold hands.

89
00:03:21,358 --> 00:03:23,058
That's not what I meant.

90
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:24,926
Well, if you were
referring to her illness

91
00:03:24,928 --> 00:03:26,928
your question should have been,
"What ails her?"

92
00:03:28,498 --> 00:03:29,464
"What ails her?"

93
00:03:29,466 --> 00:03:31,399
Oh. Who knows?

94
00:03:33,102 --> 00:03:34,402
Come on,
anything can happen.

95
00:03:34,404 --> 00:03:36,338
We can push him
down the stairs!

96
00:03:38,808 --> 00:03:40,909
Hey. Thanks for
coming to hang out.

97
00:03:40,911 --> 00:03:42,911
No problem.
How's your mom feeling?

98
00:03:42,913 --> 00:03:46,448
Okay, but she'd feel better
if she took her medicine.

99
00:03:46,450 --> 00:03:48,450
You know, when Cinnamon
won't take her medicine,

100
00:03:48,452 --> 00:03:50,152
I hide it in a piece of cheese.

101
00:03:50,154 --> 00:03:51,987
Good idea.
We can wrap the pill in cheese,

102
00:03:51,989 --> 00:03:53,021
feed it to Cinnamon,

103
00:03:53,023 --> 00:03:54,689
and then my mom
can eat Cinnamon.

104
00:03:57,827 --> 00:03:59,027
What do you feel like doing?

105
00:03:59,029 --> 00:04:01,029
I was thinking
we could watch a DVD.

106
00:04:01,031 --> 00:04:02,230
Well, (sighs)

107
00:04:02,232 --> 00:04:04,766
my mom doesn't have
a lot to choose from.

108
00:04:04,768 --> 00:04:08,236
Unless you want to watch
the video of her colonoscopy.

109
00:04:10,006 --> 00:04:11,306
Spoiler alert:
20 minutes in,

110
00:04:11,308 --> 00:04:12,674
they find a prune pit.

111
00:04:12,676 --> 00:04:18,980
Actually, how do you feel about
watching <i>House of 1000 Corpses?</i>

112
00:04:18,982 --> 00:04:21,483
(scoffs)
A straight-up gore-fest?

113
00:04:21,485 --> 00:04:22,517
You hate this stuff.

114
00:04:22,519 --> 00:04:24,452
I do, but for some reason,
Emily loves it

115
00:04:24,454 --> 00:04:26,354
and wants to watch it
with me tomorrow, so...

116
00:04:26,356 --> 00:04:27,556
I thought if
I start with you first,

117
00:04:27,558 --> 00:04:30,258
then I could act cool
about it with her.

118
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:32,427
That's actually
not a bad plan.

119
00:04:32,429 --> 00:04:34,029
I can sit through
the colonoscopy now,

120
00:04:34,031 --> 00:04:35,497
but that first time
I was like,

121
00:04:35,499 --> 00:04:38,033
"Oh, My God, a prune pit!"

122
00:04:42,772 --> 00:04:44,206
Uh, so... you'd watch it?

123
00:04:44,208 --> 00:04:45,373
Sure.
(sighs)

124
00:04:45,375 --> 00:04:46,841
You're a good friend.
I owe you one.

125
00:04:46,843 --> 00:04:48,310
MRS. WOLOWITZ:
Howard!

126
00:04:48,312 --> 00:04:50,212
Help me get out of the tub!

127
00:04:54,417 --> 00:04:56,084
Not that one.

128
00:04:59,622 --> 00:05:02,090
So, we're just randomly
choosing a restaurant

129
00:05:02,092 --> 00:05:03,525
without researching it online?

130
00:05:03,527 --> 00:05:04,359
Yep.

131
00:05:04,361 --> 00:05:05,927
Great.

132
00:05:05,929 --> 00:05:08,430
You know, this is how Anything
Can Happen Thursday turns into

133
00:05:08,432 --> 00:05:10,165
It Won't Stop Coming Up Friday.

134
00:05:11,968 --> 00:05:15,570
Hey, how about
that Asian fusion place?

135
00:05:15,572 --> 00:05:18,173
Fusion and Asians?

136
00:05:18,175 --> 00:05:21,443
I'm trying not to
think about science.

137
00:05:21,445 --> 00:05:23,545
What the hell?

138
00:05:25,114 --> 00:05:26,047
What...?

139
00:05:26,049 --> 00:05:27,382
She's not working late!

140
00:05:28,317 --> 00:05:30,685
And Amy doesn't
look sick.

141
00:05:30,687 --> 00:05:32,153
Why would they
lie to us?

142
00:05:32,155 --> 00:05:33,455
That's a good question.

143
00:05:33,457 --> 00:05:34,556
(knocking)

144
00:05:34,558 --> 00:05:35,423
Amy and Bernadette.

145
00:05:35,425 --> 00:05:36,324
(knocking)

146
00:05:36,326 --> 00:05:37,726
Amy and Bernadette.
(knocking)

147
00:05:37,728 --> 00:05:39,060
Amy and Bernadette.

148
00:05:39,062 --> 00:05:41,696
Why did you lie to us?!

149
00:05:44,333 --> 00:05:47,135
Hey. Listen to this:

150
00:05:47,137 --> 00:05:49,738
"Murder... cannibalism

151
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:51,273
"and satanic rituals

152
00:05:51,275 --> 00:05:52,407
"are just a few

153
00:05:52,409 --> 00:05:55,076
of the thousand plus
horrors that await."

154
00:05:55,078 --> 00:05:57,145
I just helped my mom
out of the tub,

155
00:05:57,147 --> 00:05:59,848
so, I'm one slippery horror
ahead of you.

156
00:05:59,850 --> 00:06:01,049
You're a good son.

157
00:06:01,051 --> 00:06:03,285
I don't know how you do it.

158
00:06:03,287 --> 00:06:05,020
Beach blankets,
my friend.

159
00:06:05,022 --> 00:06:06,721
It's all about
beach blankets.

160
00:06:06,723 --> 00:06:10,158
All right,
let's get this over with.

161
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:13,595
Ew, it's got
someone's hair on it!

162
00:06:13,597 --> 00:06:15,330
Oh, yeah, you're gonna
do great with this movie.

163
00:06:15,332 --> 00:06:16,731
(blows)

164
00:06:19,969 --> 00:06:22,671
You're not working late.
Why did you lie to me?

165
00:06:22,673 --> 00:06:24,939
And Amy, you told me
you were sick,

166
00:06:24,941 --> 00:06:27,842
but you look just as pale
and tired as always.

167
00:06:29,412 --> 00:06:31,179
I'm sorry.
I just needed a break

168
00:06:31,181 --> 00:06:34,182
from hearing you obsess about
what to do after string theory.

169
00:06:34,184 --> 00:06:36,351
And we kind of just
wanted one night

170
00:06:36,353 --> 00:06:38,720
where we didn't have to hear
about how miserable you are

171
00:06:38,722 --> 00:06:40,455
making this movie.

172
00:06:40,457 --> 00:06:42,557
But none of that means
we don't love you.

173
00:06:42,559 --> 00:06:45,193
I haven't been complaining
that much about the movie.

174
00:06:45,195 --> 00:06:47,762
Have I?

175
00:06:48,664 --> 00:06:50,031
I also love you.

176
00:06:53,436 --> 00:06:54,736
You know what?

177
00:06:54,738 --> 00:06:56,538
Maybe I need a break from
all of you.

178
00:06:56,540 --> 00:06:58,773
Come on, Sheldon.

179
00:06:58,775 --> 00:06:59,614
Where are we going?

180
00:06:59,639 --> 00:07:01,577
We're gonna have Anything Can
Happen Thursday, you're gonna

181
00:07:01,578 --> 00:07:03,545
tell me all about your science
stuff and I'm gonna complain

182
00:07:03,547 --> 00:07:05,280
about my movie, and we're gonna
support each other because

183
00:07:05,282 --> 00:07:06,448
that's what friends do.

184
00:07:06,450 --> 00:07:07,716
Okay.

185
00:07:07,718 --> 00:07:09,751
'Cause if I
had to pick now,

186
00:07:09,753 --> 00:07:10,681
I'd probably go with
dark matter because...

187
00:07:10,706 --> 00:07:12,706
PENNY: Shut up.

188

189
00:07:26,398 --> 00:07:28,766
(moans)

190
00:07:29,634 --> 00:07:30,768
What's wrong?

191
00:07:30,770 --> 00:07:33,637
I don't understand my food.

192
00:07:34,939 --> 00:07:39,009
Chinese noodles with
Korean barbecue...

193
00:07:39,011 --> 00:07:41,445
in a taco.

194
00:07:43,248 --> 00:07:45,115
It's fusion.

195
00:07:45,117 --> 00:07:47,618
Well, my mother would
lock her car doors

196
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:51,522
if she had to drive through
this hodgepodge of ethnicity.

197
00:07:54,759 --> 00:07:56,994
Think I've been complaining
too much about the movie?

198
00:07:56,996 --> 00:07:58,796
Not at all.

199
00:07:58,798 --> 00:08:00,230
Thank you.

200
00:08:00,232 --> 00:08:02,399
But to be fair, when you talk,
most of what you say

201
00:08:02,401 --> 00:08:06,170
sounds like, "Wah,
wah, wah, clothes".

202
00:08:09,741 --> 00:08:12,042
Hey, I don't understand
why you're not upset with Amy.

203
00:08:12,044 --> 00:08:14,611
I am. So much so that
I'm gonna bring her here

204
00:08:14,613 --> 00:08:16,847
for dinner on our
next date night.

205
00:08:19,784 --> 00:08:21,985
(heavy metal soundtrack
plays on movie)

206
00:08:27,158 --> 00:08:29,159
Okay.

207
00:08:29,161 --> 00:08:31,862
So, in the last 20 minutes,

208
00:08:31,864 --> 00:08:34,665
we've seen a crazy woman
kissing a fetus in a jar.

209
00:08:36,067 --> 00:08:39,603
We've seen a guy
cut in half and sewn to a fish.

210
00:08:40,972 --> 00:08:43,807
And the brutal dismemberment
of a rotisserie chicken

211
00:08:43,809 --> 00:08:46,009
by my mother.

212
00:08:47,245 --> 00:08:51,582
On the bright side, she didn't
even notice the pill.

213
00:08:53,785 --> 00:08:56,453
Why does Emily like this stuff?

214
00:08:56,455 --> 00:08:58,655
Do you think there's something
psychologically wrong with her?

215
00:08:58,657 --> 00:09:01,125
What difference does it make?
What do you mean?

216
00:09:01,127 --> 00:09:02,759
Oh, come on-- she could
have a freezer full of

217
00:09:02,761 --> 00:09:05,596
ex-boyfriend's body parts and
you'd still go out with her.

218
00:09:06,764 --> 00:09:08,398
I do like that
the ex-boyfriend's

219
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:09,833
out of the picture.

220
00:09:13,938 --> 00:09:16,039
I feel so bad about
lying to Sheldon.

221
00:09:16,041 --> 00:09:17,808
How am I gonna
make it up to him?

222
00:09:17,810 --> 00:09:19,476
I'd tell you
what I do with Howard,

223
00:09:19,478 --> 00:09:21,778
but I don't think dressing up
like a Catholic schoolgirl

224
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:24,848
is gonna work with Sheldon.

225
00:09:27,385 --> 00:09:29,486
He'd probably give you homework.

226
00:09:33,725 --> 00:09:35,926
Did you lie to Howard
about tonight?

227
00:09:35,928 --> 00:09:36,960
Of course.

228
00:09:36,962 --> 00:09:38,595
And you don't feel
guilty about it?

229
00:09:38,597 --> 00:09:39,863
Between Penny's gorilla movie

230
00:09:39,865 --> 00:09:43,367
and Howard's gorilla mother,
I had no choice.

231
00:09:44,435 --> 00:09:45,869
Thankfully Penny and I have

232
00:09:45,871 --> 00:09:47,304
a relationship based on honesty.

233
00:09:47,306 --> 00:09:48,805
(snorts)

234
00:09:48,807 --> 00:09:50,440
What?

235
00:09:50,442 --> 00:09:51,775
I don't lie to her.

236
00:09:51,777 --> 00:09:54,378
Oh, we know
<i>you</i> don't lie to <i>her.</i>

237
00:10:00,585 --> 00:10:02,085
Thank you.

238
00:10:02,087 --> 00:10:03,320
Hey, maybe the answer

239
00:10:03,322 --> 00:10:05,889
to your career question is
in one of these.

240
00:10:05,891 --> 00:10:08,659
Penny,
there's only one cookie

241
00:10:08,661 --> 00:10:11,094
with something in the middle
that solves life's problems,

242
00:10:11,096 --> 00:10:13,163
and that's an Oreo.

243
00:10:14,365 --> 00:10:18,335
Or a Nutter Butter,
if you're in a pinch.

244
00:10:18,337 --> 00:10:21,138
Come on, open it.
I bet it says something great.

245
00:10:21,140 --> 00:10:22,940
This is Asian fusion.

246
00:10:22,942 --> 00:10:27,144
For all you know, there's
a tiny Chihuahua in here.

247
00:10:27,146 --> 00:10:29,112
Fine, I'll go.

248
00:10:29,114 --> 00:10:31,014
Hmm.

249
00:10:31,016 --> 00:10:33,917
"People turn to you
for guidance and wisdom."

250
00:10:33,919 --> 00:10:35,219
Yeah, that's a good one.

251
00:10:35,221 --> 00:10:37,321
No, it's not.

252
00:10:37,323 --> 00:10:38,755
How is that not good?

253
00:10:38,757 --> 00:10:40,991
"Turn to you for wisdom"?

254
00:10:40,993 --> 00:10:43,694
Clearly,
that cookie is mocking you.

255
00:10:44,696 --> 00:10:46,296
You'd never hear
that kind of sass

256
00:10:46,298 --> 00:10:48,298
from a Nutter Butter.

257
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:50,701
Uh, since you're paying for
dinner, I'll let that slide.

258
00:10:50,703 --> 00:10:52,135
Open yours.

259
00:10:53,771 --> 00:10:55,772
Have you ever paid for a meal?

260
00:10:55,774 --> 00:10:57,341
Not with money. Read.

261
00:11:00,278 --> 00:11:04,414
"Your warm and fun-loving nature
delights those around you."

262
00:11:04,416 --> 00:11:06,450
Oh, try again.
(clears her throat)

263
00:11:08,987 --> 00:11:11,455
(loud thudding on TV)

264
00:11:11,457 --> 00:11:13,857
(creaking on TV)

265
00:11:13,859 --> 00:11:15,125
(movie stops)

266
00:11:15,127 --> 00:11:16,493
(clears his throat)

267
00:11:17,328 --> 00:11:19,596
Let me get this straight.

268
00:11:19,598 --> 00:11:22,232
So, he kills this girl's father,

269
00:11:22,234 --> 00:11:24,434
cuts off the guy's face,

270
00:11:24,436 --> 00:11:26,536
and is wearing it as a mask

271
00:11:26,538 --> 00:11:29,406
while he makes out with her.

272
00:11:29,408 --> 00:11:31,308
I'm just gonna say it.

273
00:11:31,310 --> 00:11:34,044
That's not okay.

274
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:37,781
Why can't I be in a relationship

275
00:11:37,783 --> 00:11:40,684
with a girl
who likes <i>The Sound of Music?</i>

276
00:11:40,686 --> 00:11:44,121
Raj, you <i>are</i> the girl
in the relationship

277
00:11:44,123 --> 00:11:46,323
who likes <i>The Sound of Music.</i>

278
00:11:47,158 --> 00:11:49,359
(ringtone playing)

279
00:11:50,561 --> 00:11:52,996
Hey, Penny. What's up?

280
00:11:54,065 --> 00:11:56,233
No, Bernie's working late.

281
00:11:58,069 --> 00:12:00,470
Really?

282
00:12:00,472 --> 00:12:02,205
Thanks for telling me.

283
00:12:02,207 --> 00:12:04,975
What?

284
00:12:04,977 --> 00:12:08,111
I'm having sex with a Catholic
schoolgirl tonight.

285
00:12:08,113 --> 00:12:10,280
(laughs)

286
00:12:12,383 --> 00:12:14,017
(Penny gasps)

287
00:12:14,019 --> 00:12:16,453
Oh, I think I see
our next stop.

288
00:12:16,455 --> 00:12:18,121
(shrieks happily)

289
00:12:18,123 --> 00:12:20,724
You can't be serious.

290
00:12:20,726 --> 00:12:22,492
If I wanted to waste my time
on nonsense,

291
00:12:22,494 --> 00:12:24,961
I'd follow Leonard
on Instagram.

292
00:12:25,997 --> 00:12:29,199
No, come on-- tonight,
we are trying new things.

293
00:12:29,201 --> 00:12:30,967
(groans)

294
00:12:30,969 --> 00:12:33,437
Oh! That's a lot of incense.

295
00:12:33,439 --> 00:12:36,139
Or someone set a hippie on fire.

296
00:12:39,811 --> 00:12:41,978
Yeah, honey,
I'm still stuck at work.

297
00:12:43,247 --> 00:12:44,614
Really?

298
00:12:44,616 --> 00:12:45,849
Penny said that?

299
00:12:47,952 --> 00:12:50,854
Okay, it's true. I'm sorry.

300
00:12:50,856 --> 00:12:53,123
I'll see you at home.

301
00:12:53,125 --> 00:12:55,492
Yeah, yeah, I'll put it on.

302
00:12:56,828 --> 00:12:59,229
You and I never just
hang out like this.

303
00:12:59,231 --> 00:13:00,397
Why is that?

304
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:02,199
I know, it's weird, right?
Yeah.

305
00:13:02,201 --> 00:13:03,367
We should do it more often.

306
00:13:03,369 --> 00:13:05,969
Oh, no. I mean, this
is weird right now.

307
00:13:05,971 --> 00:13:07,337
(phone chimes)

308
00:13:07,339 --> 00:13:09,005
Oh.

309
00:13:09,007 --> 00:13:10,507
Ah, it's Penny.

310
00:13:10,509 --> 00:13:11,842
Is she still mad?

311
00:13:11,844 --> 00:13:12,976
Oh, doesn't seem like it.

312
00:13:12,978 --> 00:13:15,679
She got Sheldon to go
to a psychic with her.

313
00:13:15,681 --> 00:13:16,980
A psychic?

314
00:13:16,982 --> 00:13:19,383
He considers them
not just mumbo jumbo,

315
00:13:19,385 --> 00:13:22,452
but extra-jumbo
mumbo jumbo.

316
00:13:22,454 --> 00:13:24,888
Well, Penny can be
pretty persuasive.

317
00:13:24,890 --> 00:13:27,924
She's gotten me to do a lot of
things I wouldn't normally do.

318
00:13:27,926 --> 00:13:29,860
Because she has
sex with you.

319
00:13:29,862 --> 00:13:32,896
Yeah, she does.

320
00:13:32,898 --> 00:13:35,265
Can I confess something?

321
00:13:35,267 --> 00:13:37,167
Once in a while,
I get a little jealous

322
00:13:37,169 --> 00:13:38,602
of how close Penny
and Sheldon are.

323
00:13:38,604 --> 00:13:39,668
Really?

324
00:13:39,693 --> 00:13:41,272
I mean, not in
a romantic way.

325
00:13:41,273 --> 00:13:44,741
It's just, she really has some
sort of connection with him.

326
00:13:44,743 --> 00:13:47,477
Well... Well, they've known
each other a long time,

327
00:13:47,479 --> 00:13:49,846
and Penny grew up around horses,

328
00:13:49,848 --> 00:13:53,650
so she knows how to approach him
without making him skittish.

329
00:13:53,652 --> 00:13:55,886
Don't get me wrong.
I'm glad they're friends.

330
00:13:55,888 --> 00:13:58,355
I just wish he'd be that
comfortable around me already.

331
00:13:58,357 --> 00:14:02,726
Well, it took him a long time to
get comfortable around me, too.

332
00:14:02,728 --> 00:14:05,028
Really? What did you do?

333
00:14:05,030 --> 00:14:08,498
Something terrible in a former life?
I don't know.

334
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:11,034
I gotta go.

335
00:14:11,036 --> 00:14:12,636
Penny ratted me out.

336
00:14:12,638 --> 00:14:14,404
FYI, she's getting you
a watch for your birthday

337
00:14:14,406 --> 00:14:16,206
with money she took
out of your wallet.

338
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:25,949
I don't mean to be
rude or discourteous,

339
00:14:25,951 --> 00:14:27,784
but before we begin,
I'd just like to say

340
00:14:27,786 --> 00:14:30,353
there is absolutely
no scientific evidence

341
00:14:30,355 --> 00:14:32,689
to support clairvoyance
of any kind.

342
00:14:32,691 --> 00:14:34,591
Which means--

343
00:14:34,593 --> 00:14:38,862
and again, no insult intended--
but you're a fraud...

344
00:14:39,697 --> 00:14:41,832
...your profession
is a swindle,

345
00:14:41,834 --> 00:14:43,366
and, uh, your livelihood
is dependent

346
00:14:43,368 --> 00:14:46,236
on the gullibility
of stupid people.

347
00:14:47,572 --> 00:14:50,640
Again, no offense.

348
00:14:50,642 --> 00:14:52,409
All right, Sheldon,
just ask your question.

349
00:14:52,411 --> 00:14:55,612
(clears his throat)

350
00:14:55,614 --> 00:14:58,248
Okay, I just did.
What was it?

351
00:14:59,183 --> 00:15:00,517
Oh, for God's sake.

352
00:15:00,519 --> 00:15:01,818
Look, he's a physicist
who's trying to figure out

353
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:03,119
what his next field
of study should be.

354
00:15:03,121 --> 00:15:04,321
For your information,

355
00:15:04,323 --> 00:15:07,290
I was asking her
about the next <i>Star Trek</i> movie.

356
00:15:07,292 --> 00:15:11,094
Okay, I can answer that one:
I'll be bored.

357
00:15:11,096 --> 00:15:13,363
All right, why don't we begin?

358
00:15:13,365 --> 00:15:15,632
(sighs)

359
00:15:15,634 --> 00:15:17,801
(exhales deeply)

360
00:15:21,138 --> 00:15:23,073
Your spirit guides
are telling me

361
00:15:23,075 --> 00:15:25,175
that there's a woman
in your life

362
00:15:25,177 --> 00:15:27,177
you're having problems with.

363
00:15:27,179 --> 00:15:29,346
That's an easy guess.

364
00:15:29,348 --> 00:15:31,047
I'm clearly an annoying person

365
00:15:31,049 --> 00:15:33,550
and have problems
with both genders.

366
00:15:33,552 --> 00:15:36,753
Yes, you clearly are.

367
00:15:38,055 --> 00:15:39,356
But I'm seeing

368
00:15:39,358 --> 00:15:40,957
a specific woman

369
00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:43,593
that you're in a romantic
relationship with.

370
00:15:43,595 --> 00:15:45,929
Oh, oh, here we go.

371
00:15:46,998 --> 00:15:48,064
Does she have dark hair?

372
00:15:48,066 --> 00:15:52,068
Yes! Yes! Your spirit guides
are on fire!

373
00:15:52,070 --> 00:15:54,271
The majority
of people have dark hair.

374
00:15:54,273 --> 00:15:56,773
Even you, at one time.

375
00:15:57,942 --> 00:15:59,809
Does she work
in a similar field to you?

376
00:15:59,811 --> 00:16:01,411
Ha! The opposite.

377
00:16:01,413 --> 00:16:04,581
She's a neurobiologist, and
I'm a theoretical physicist.

378
00:16:04,583 --> 00:16:06,816
My spirit guides
can go suck an egg.

379
00:16:08,052 --> 00:16:09,352
They're telling me

380
00:16:09,354 --> 00:16:11,788
that you have difficulty
being close with her.

381
00:16:11,790 --> 00:16:14,324
Oh, he does. He <i>so</i> does.
What should he do?

382
00:16:14,326 --> 00:16:16,526
(exhales)

383
00:16:18,362 --> 00:16:20,864
He should give himself
to this relationship.

384
00:16:20,866 --> 00:16:22,933
Once he does, all his

385
00:16:22,935 --> 00:16:25,168
other pursuits will come
into focus.

386
00:16:25,170 --> 00:16:26,469
Sheldon, do you hear that?

387
00:16:26,471 --> 00:16:28,805
I mean, Amy is the key
to your happiness.

388
00:16:28,807 --> 00:16:30,006
Exactly.

389
00:16:30,008 --> 00:16:31,841
Personally and professionally.

390
00:16:31,843 --> 00:16:36,046
Everything will fall into place
once you commit to her.

391
00:16:41,185 --> 00:16:43,286
You know what this is?

392
00:16:43,288 --> 00:16:46,289
Yeah, and I reserve this word
for those rare instances

393
00:16:46,291 --> 00:16:47,991
when it's truly deserved.

394
00:16:47,993 --> 00:16:50,293
This is malarkey!

395
00:16:54,865 --> 00:16:56,533
Wow, you really struck a nerve.

396
00:16:56,535 --> 00:16:59,469
I've never heard him use
the "M" word before.

397
00:17:08,253 --> 00:17:09,754
Here we go:

398
00:17:09,756 --> 00:17:11,756
<i>House of a 1,000 Corpses.</i>

399
00:17:11,758 --> 00:17:13,558
Now, just so you know,

400
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:16,294
I was a nanny for three years,
so if you get scared,

401
00:17:16,296 --> 00:17:18,529
I can totally change
your diaper.

402
00:17:18,531 --> 00:17:22,099
Actually, I have to
tell you something.

403
00:17:22,101 --> 00:17:25,369
These kind of movies
really aren't my thing,

404
00:17:25,371 --> 00:17:27,305
so, last night,
I watched it

405
00:17:27,327 --> 00:17:28,766
just to see what I was
getting myself into.

406
00:17:28,791 --> 00:17:30,375
Okay.

407
00:17:30,376 --> 00:17:32,476
And I have to be honest--
I thought it was

408
00:17:32,478 --> 00:17:35,379
disturbing and weird,
and it made me wonder

409
00:17:35,381 --> 00:17:37,582
what it says about
someone who enjoys it.

410
00:17:37,584 --> 00:17:39,750
I wonder that, too.

411
00:17:39,752 --> 00:17:41,752
Then, why do you
watch these things?

412
00:17:41,754 --> 00:17:44,488
Can I tell you something
without you judging me?

413
00:17:44,490 --> 00:17:46,457
Sure.

414
00:17:46,459 --> 00:17:48,459
They kind of turn me on.

415
00:17:48,461 --> 00:17:51,095
And play.

416
00:17:51,097 --> 00:17:53,331
(eerie sound effects,
heavy metal soundtrack playing)

417
00:17:56,435 --> 00:17:58,102
MAN (in distorted voice):
Attention...

418
00:17:59,237 --> 00:18:01,439
(knocking)

419
00:18:03,208 --> 00:18:05,176
Hello.

420
00:18:05,178 --> 00:18:06,844
I didn't expect you
this evening.

421
00:18:06,846 --> 00:18:08,813
Well, I was just feeling so bad

422
00:18:08,815 --> 00:18:10,514
about lying to you
the other night,

423
00:18:10,516 --> 00:18:13,217
I wanted to make it up to you.

424
00:18:13,219 --> 00:18:15,553
And how do you propose
to do that?

425
00:18:26,982 --> 00:18:29,318
Unless you have <i>Gravity</i>
on Blu-ray under that skirt,

426
00:18:29,319 --> 00:18:30,851
I don't know
where you're going with this.
