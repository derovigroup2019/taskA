1
00:00:02,703 --> 00:00:05,105
Almost there.
You're doing great.

2
00:00:05,107 --> 00:00:06,873
Thanks for lifting my spirits.

3
00:00:06,875 --> 00:00:08,775
Next time, try lifting the box.

4
00:00:09,644 --> 00:00:11,578
Please hurry.

5
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:13,180
I don't need
a treadmill!

6
00:00:13,182 --> 00:00:15,882
The doctor says
you need to get exercise!

7
00:00:15,884 --> 00:00:18,084
I get plenty
of exercise!

8
00:00:18,086 --> 00:00:21,888
Crushing my will to live
isn't exercise!

9
00:00:21,890 --> 00:00:25,325
If she isn't gonna use it,
then why are we doing this?

10
00:00:25,327 --> 00:00:27,494
She'll use it.
All I need is to rig it

11
00:00:27,496 --> 00:00:30,664
with a fishing pole
and a HoneyBaked Ham.

12
00:00:30,666 --> 00:00:31,898
All right.

13
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:33,033
Now what?

14
00:00:33,035 --> 00:00:35,168
We set it up
in Howie's old room.

15
00:00:35,170 --> 00:00:36,203
Do you know how to set it up?

16
00:00:36,205 --> 00:00:38,238
Please,
I'm an MIT-trained engineer.

17
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:39,739
I think I can handle...

18
00:00:39,741 --> 00:00:41,141
Ma, look out!

19
00:00:43,712 --> 00:00:47,881
I told you this
thing would kill me!

20
00:00:47,883 --> 00:00:51,518
? Our whole universe
was in a hot, dense state ?

21
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:54,854
? Then nearly 14 billion years
ago expansion started... Wait! ?

22
00:00:54,856 --> 00:00:56,489
? The Earth began to cool

23
00:00:56,491 --> 00:00:59,025
? The autotrophs began to drool,
Neanderthals developed tools ?

24
00:00:59,027 --> 00:01:01,695
? We built the Wall
? <i>We built the pyramids</i> ?

25
00:01:01,697 --> 00:01:04,364
? Math, Science, History,
unraveling the mystery ?

26
00:01:04,366 --> 00:01:06,266
? That all started
with a big bang ?

27
00:01:06,268 --> 00:01:08,082
? <i>Bang!</i> ?

28
00:01:08,083 --> 00:01:12,083

30
00:01:17,110 --> 00:01:21,279
So she's gonna be laid up
for at least six weeks.

31
00:01:21,281 --> 00:01:22,681
Poor Mrs. Wolowitz.

32
00:01:22,683 --> 00:01:24,282
Should we do something
for her?

33
00:01:24,284 --> 00:01:27,853
I know. Let's go see
the new Spider-Man movie.

34
00:01:28,955 --> 00:01:31,523
Sheldon, we're talking
about your friend's mother.

35
00:01:31,525 --> 00:01:32,591
She got hurt.

36
00:01:32,593 --> 00:01:34,693
I thought that subject
had run its course,

37
00:01:34,695 --> 00:01:36,328
so I changed it.

38
00:01:36,330 --> 00:01:39,831
It's called reading
the room, Amy.

39
00:01:39,833 --> 00:01:41,400
Hi.

40
00:01:41,402 --> 00:01:42,634
Hey, how were things on the set?

41
00:01:42,636 --> 00:01:44,036
Uh, pretty good, actually.

42
00:01:44,038 --> 00:01:45,837
So the movie's not
as bad as you thought?

43
00:01:45,839 --> 00:01:47,305
Oh, no, it is,

44
00:01:47,307 --> 00:01:48,874
but I decided,
instead of complaining about it,

45
00:01:48,876 --> 00:01:51,176
I'm just gonna go in every day
and give it my all.

46
00:01:51,178 --> 00:01:52,411
Good for you.
Thanks.

47
00:01:52,413 --> 00:01:54,079
There's no reason why
I shouldn't be

48
00:01:54,081 --> 00:01:56,682
the best bisexual go-go dancer
slowly transforming

49
00:01:56,684 --> 00:02:00,085
into a killer gorilla
anyone's ever seen.

50
00:02:00,087 --> 00:02:01,720
I don't know.

51
00:02:01,722 --> 00:02:04,256
The bisexual gorilla
go-go dancer in <i>Schindler's List</i>

52
00:02:04,258 --> 00:02:05,590
is tough to beat.

53
00:02:05,592 --> 00:02:07,559
Ah, very good.

54
00:02:07,561 --> 00:02:10,762
Because a gorilla go-go dancer
of any sexual preference

55
00:02:10,764 --> 00:02:13,498
would be out of place in a film
about the Holocaust.

56
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:17,135
It only gets funnier
when you explain it, Sheldon.

57
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:20,172
I know.

58
00:02:23,009 --> 00:02:26,511
Okay, she's all settled
in the guest room.

59
00:02:26,513 --> 00:02:28,246
Maybe we should get
one of those machines

60
00:02:28,248 --> 00:02:30,115
to help her up the stairs.

61
00:02:30,117 --> 00:02:32,017
You mean a forklift?

62
00:02:32,785 --> 00:02:34,786
Howie...
I'm sorry.

63
00:02:34,788 --> 00:02:36,955
I just can't deal
with this right now.

64
00:02:36,957 --> 00:02:39,024
Taking care of your own mother?
How can you say that?

65
00:02:39,026 --> 00:02:41,893
Bernie, she's gonna be off
her feet for six to eight weeks.

66
00:02:41,895 --> 00:02:44,062
Are you prepared
to feed her, wash her

67
00:02:44,064 --> 00:02:45,864
and take her to the toilet?

68
00:02:45,866 --> 00:02:48,567
I would do it for my mother.
Yeah, of course

69
00:02:48,569 --> 00:02:51,069
you would--
you're a loving person.

70
00:02:51,071 --> 00:02:55,707
I'm what my people
would call a <i>putz.</i>

71
00:02:55,709 --> 00:02:58,210
Look, I'm not crazy
about the idea,

72
00:02:58,212 --> 00:03:00,112
but what other
choice do we have?

73
00:03:00,114 --> 00:03:01,146
We get a nurse.

74
00:03:01,148 --> 00:03:03,014
Preferably someone
from a Third World country

75
00:03:03,016 --> 00:03:06,651
who's used to suffering
and unpleasant smells.

76
00:03:08,054 --> 00:03:09,488
You'd hire a
total stranger

77
00:03:09,490 --> 00:03:11,857
to take care of the
woman who raised you?

78
00:03:11,859 --> 00:03:12,958
That's so cruel.

79
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:15,360
Not if we pay them well

80
00:03:15,362 --> 00:03:18,396
and let them listen
to the music of their homeland.

81
00:03:20,099 --> 00:03:22,501
I need to tinkle!

82
00:03:22,503 --> 00:03:25,103
Sounds like a job
for a loving person.

83
00:03:26,873 --> 00:03:28,473
Would you like me
to play some Polish music

84
00:03:28,475 --> 00:03:29,975
while you carry her
to the toilet?

85
00:03:31,477 --> 00:03:33,245
You are a <i>putz.</i>

86
00:03:34,547 --> 00:03:36,915
As advertised.

87
00:03:40,887 --> 00:03:42,120
Thanks for coming
with me.

88
00:03:42,122 --> 00:03:45,157
Thanks for inviting me
after everyone else said no.

89
00:03:47,093 --> 00:03:48,860
Aren't you gonna get
3-D glasses?

90
00:03:48,862 --> 00:03:50,529
I brought my own.

91
00:03:50,531 --> 00:03:54,866
No sense in risking
bridge-of-nose herpes.

92
00:03:55,735 --> 00:03:57,002
Is that a real thing?

93
00:03:57,004 --> 00:03:59,838
Well, until they invent
nose condoms,

94
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:02,007
I'm not finding out.

95
00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:06,111
Emily! Hey!

96
00:04:06,113 --> 00:04:07,579
Oh, hey, Raj.

97
00:04:07,581 --> 00:04:09,047
Uh, this is my friend, Sheldon.

98
00:04:09,049 --> 00:04:10,482
Sheldon, this is Emily.

99
00:04:11,284 --> 00:04:13,385
Oh, yes, you're
the dermatologist.

100
00:04:13,387 --> 00:04:17,189
I went for a walk yesterday
without sunscreen.

101
00:04:17,191 --> 00:04:20,992
Do you see anything
on my forehead

102
00:04:20,994 --> 00:04:23,995
that I should be
concerned about?

103
00:04:23,997 --> 00:04:27,065
Um, you know what?
I better go.

104
00:04:27,067 --> 00:04:28,333
My movie's about
to start.

105
00:04:28,335 --> 00:04:29,601
Are you here alone?

106
00:04:29,603 --> 00:04:30,602
No, not really.

107
00:04:30,604 --> 00:04:32,137
What do you mean,
"not really"?

108
00:04:32,139 --> 00:04:33,438
Hey, should we get
our seats?

109
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:34,873
Yeah.

110
00:04:34,875 --> 00:04:37,175
It was nice seeing you.
Um, I'll call you later.

111
00:04:37,177 --> 00:04:38,343
Yeah, okay.

112
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:43,849
That was awkward, right?

113
00:04:45,585 --> 00:04:46,985
Uh-huh.

114
00:04:46,987 --> 00:04:48,386
Is it because
she's dating you

115
00:04:48,388 --> 00:04:49,842
but was out with
that other fellow?

116
00:04:49,867 --> 00:04:50,756
Yes.

117
00:04:50,757 --> 00:04:53,325
Good. I thought she saw
something on my forehead.

118
00:04:56,429 --> 00:04:58,563
And... action.

119
00:04:58,565 --> 00:05:00,699
Please don't shut me out.

120
00:05:00,701 --> 00:05:01,666
Go away.

121
00:05:01,668 --> 00:05:04,669
Just go away.

122
00:05:04,671 --> 00:05:07,873
I swear, I will find a way
to turn you back.

123
00:05:07,875 --> 00:05:09,241
What gave you
the right

124
00:05:09,243 --> 00:05:12,944
to mix my DNA with that
of a killer gorilla?

125
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:16,514
I was trying
to save your life.

126
00:05:16,516 --> 00:05:19,050
Life? What life?
Look at me! I'm a monster!

127
00:05:19,052 --> 00:05:22,520
And now I have blood on my
hands, or paws. I don't know.

128
00:05:26,125 --> 00:05:29,628
You can't give up.
I love you.

129
00:05:31,731 --> 00:05:33,598
I love you, too.

130
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,401
But I'm afraid
I love killing more.

131
00:05:36,403 --> 00:05:39,271
Like, one day, I might
actually try and kill you!

132
00:05:41,942 --> 00:05:45,076
And... cut.
All right.

133
00:05:47,847 --> 00:05:49,581
All right, let's set up
for the next scene.

134
00:05:49,583 --> 00:05:53,118
Actually, you know what?
Can we do one more?

135
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,185
I think I could do it better.

136
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:56,354
Let's just move on.
No one cares.

137
00:05:56,356 --> 00:05:57,889
Well,  I care.
I mean, look,

138
00:05:57,891 --> 00:06:00,158
if we're gonna do this,
why not try and make it

139
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,493
something
we're actually proud of?

140
00:06:04,764 --> 00:06:05,730
Look, sweetie,

141
00:06:05,732 --> 00:06:06,965
this movie is garbage,

142
00:06:06,967 --> 00:06:08,500
but you should be happy
about that,

143
00:06:08,502 --> 00:06:11,469
'cause if it was a good movie,
you wouldn't be in it.

144
00:06:12,972 --> 00:06:13,972
Whoa, whoa, hang on.

145
00:06:13,974 --> 00:06:15,273
There's no need
to insult her.

146
00:06:15,275 --> 00:06:16,041
And who are you?

147
00:06:16,043 --> 00:06:17,175
I'm her boyfriend.

148
00:06:17,177 --> 00:06:18,376
Isn't she too hot for you?

149
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:20,645
A little, yeah.

150
00:06:20,647 --> 00:06:22,580
Well, boyfriend, get off my set.

151
00:06:22,582 --> 00:06:24,182
You can't do that.
He's with me.

152
00:06:24,184 --> 00:06:26,651
You know what? You can get off
my set, too. You're fired.

153
00:06:26,653 --> 00:06:28,586
What? You can't fire me.
I'm the star.

154
00:06:28,588 --> 00:06:32,157
I'm the girl that goes bananas.
It says so on the poster.

155
00:06:32,159 --> 00:06:34,926
Yeah, but we just shot the last
scene where we see your face.

156
00:06:34,928 --> 00:06:40,265
So from now own, the star of
the movie is whoever wears this.

157
00:06:41,367 --> 00:06:43,268
Hey, if you're
gonna fire her,

158
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:45,170
then you have to
fire me, too.

159
00:06:45,172 --> 00:06:49,274
Wow, that fell apart
really fast.

160
00:06:57,775 --> 00:06:59,609
Thanks for skipping
the movie.

161
00:06:59,611 --> 00:07:01,944
I couldn't sit in that theater
for two hours

162
00:07:01,946 --> 00:07:03,846
wondering about Emily
and that guy.

163
00:07:03,848 --> 00:07:05,648
Oh, quite all right.

164
00:07:05,650 --> 00:07:07,483
After my forehead
melanoma scare,

165
00:07:07,485 --> 00:07:09,652
I've learned not to sweat
the small stuff.

166
00:07:12,256 --> 00:07:13,656
Well, sorry,

167
00:07:13,658 --> 00:07:16,292
I don't have all the ingredients
to make chai tea.

168
00:07:16,294 --> 00:07:17,727
You don't have
to make me anything.

169
00:07:17,729 --> 00:07:20,163
No, I do.
You're upset about Emily

170
00:07:20,165 --> 00:07:21,097
and you're Indian.

171
00:07:21,099 --> 00:07:22,965
I need to make you
chai tea.

172
00:07:22,967 --> 00:07:28,704
Now, I have all the ingredients
except cardamom seeds.

173
00:07:28,706 --> 00:07:31,307
Do you happen
to have any on you?

174
00:07:31,309 --> 00:07:34,577
Sorry, I left them in my turban.

175
00:07:37,181 --> 00:07:39,682
Oh, I'll make
English breakfast tea.

176
00:07:39,684 --> 00:07:41,084
They destroyed
your culture.

177
00:07:41,086 --> 00:07:42,618
That's close enough.

178
00:07:45,756 --> 00:07:47,957
You know, I'm curious,

179
00:07:47,959 --> 00:07:51,627
why are you so upset about
seeing Emily with another man?

180
00:07:51,629 --> 00:07:54,797
Wouldn't you be upset if you saw
Amy out with someone else?

181
00:07:54,799 --> 00:07:55,965
Can't happen.

182
00:07:55,967 --> 00:07:58,167
We have an ironclad
relationship agreement

183
00:07:58,169 --> 00:08:00,470
which precludes her
from physical contact

184
00:08:00,472 --> 00:08:02,905
with anyone other than me.

185
00:08:02,907 --> 00:08:05,508
But you don't have sex
with her, either.

186
00:08:05,510 --> 00:08:08,044
Slick, huh?

187
00:08:08,046 --> 00:08:11,314
To be truthful, Emily and I
haven't dated that long,

188
00:08:11,316 --> 00:08:13,816
and we never agreed to be
exclusive to each other.

189
00:08:13,818 --> 00:08:15,251
Have you had intercourse?

190
00:08:15,253 --> 00:08:16,385
No.

191
00:08:16,387 --> 00:08:17,687
Well, stick to your guns.

192
00:08:17,689 --> 00:08:19,322
There will be a lot of pressure.

193
00:08:25,162 --> 00:08:27,563
I'm hungry again!

194
00:08:29,666 --> 00:08:32,835
It's like the world's
fattest cuckoo clock.

195
00:08:36,773 --> 00:08:38,474
You know, you're
always talking about

196
00:08:38,476 --> 00:08:39,575
having a baby someday.

197
00:08:39,577 --> 00:08:41,611
This is exactly what
it's gonna be like.

198
00:08:41,613 --> 00:08:43,112
No, it's not.

199
00:08:43,114 --> 00:08:46,315
Come on. The constant
fussing, eating, pooping,

200
00:08:46,317 --> 00:08:47,316
burping, drooling.

201
00:08:47,318 --> 00:08:48,985
We're even waiting
for the day

202
00:08:48,987 --> 00:08:51,287
when she can finally
walk on her own.

203
00:08:52,422 --> 00:08:53,656
Maybe you're right.

204
00:08:53,658 --> 00:08:56,893
Anything she finds on the floor
goes right in her mouth.

205
00:09:01,932 --> 00:09:04,433
I'm just telling you now,
if we do have kids,

206
00:09:04,435 --> 00:09:06,636
don't expect me
to do all the work.

207
00:09:06,638 --> 00:09:09,505
Hey, I'm a very paternal person.

208
00:09:09,507 --> 00:09:12,575
I'd be excellent
at taking care of a baby.

209
00:09:12,577 --> 00:09:15,011
I'm still hungry!

210
00:09:15,013 --> 00:09:16,946
I'm coming, you big baby!

211
00:09:20,918 --> 00:09:23,686
You know, the only thing worse
than doing a movie

212
00:09:23,688 --> 00:09:26,722
where they glue monkey hair
to your ass

213
00:09:26,724 --> 00:09:28,090
is getting fired from a movie

214
00:09:28,092 --> 00:09:30,693
where they glue monkey hair
to your ass.

215
00:09:31,695 --> 00:09:34,363
Forget it, man,
it's crap.

216
00:09:34,365 --> 00:09:36,032
You just move on
to the next thing.

217
00:09:36,034 --> 00:09:37,767
Yeah, well, it's easy
for you to say.

218
00:09:37,769 --> 00:09:39,802
You used to be famous.

219
00:09:39,804 --> 00:09:42,872
Hey. I just lost
a job for you.

220
00:09:42,874 --> 00:09:45,708
You're right, I'm sorry,
you're famous.

221
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:47,910
Penny, it's not
about being famous.

222
00:09:47,912 --> 00:09:49,946
It's about the art.

223
00:09:49,948 --> 00:09:51,981
It's about the passion
we have for our craft.

224
00:09:53,918 --> 00:09:56,219
I have an audition
for <i>Sharknado 2!</i>

225
00:09:56,221 --> 00:09:58,054
If I book this,
I am totally gonna

226
00:09:58,056 --> 00:09:59,589
pay you back
for this beer.

227
00:10:02,726 --> 00:10:06,329
God, what am I
doing with my life?

228
00:10:06,331 --> 00:10:08,064
You having second thoughts
about acting?

229
00:10:08,066 --> 00:10:09,999
You were on set, you
saw what it was like.

230
00:10:10,001 --> 00:10:12,368
Yeah, but it's not
always that bad.

231
00:10:12,370 --> 00:10:13,502
Oh, really?

232
00:10:13,504 --> 00:10:15,137
What about when you did, uh,

233
00:10:15,139 --> 00:10:16,872
Anne Frank at that
cute little theater?

234
00:10:16,874 --> 00:10:19,308
It was over a bowling alley.

235
00:10:20,410 --> 00:10:22,211
Yeah, but...

236
00:10:22,213 --> 00:10:25,781
there was ample parking.

237
00:10:25,783 --> 00:10:27,049
Are you done?

238
00:10:27,051 --> 00:10:29,151
And you were so good
in the TV commercial.

239
00:10:29,153 --> 00:10:32,154
It was for hemorrhoid cream.

240
00:10:32,156 --> 00:10:34,190
And I got itchy and swollen

241
00:10:34,192 --> 00:10:36,325
just watching you.

242
00:10:39,529 --> 00:10:41,664
Leonard, you are really
not cheering me up.

243
00:10:41,666 --> 00:10:42,798
Come on.

244
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,734
How can you be sad
when you're going home

245
00:10:44,736 --> 00:10:47,503
with all five-foot-six of this?

246
00:10:47,505 --> 00:10:50,573
Hmm. You think you're
five-foot-six, that's funny.

247
00:10:53,910 --> 00:10:55,878
I don't understand it.

248
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:56,912
I'm a nice guy,

249
00:10:56,914 --> 00:10:58,447
I have a great job,

250
00:10:58,449 --> 00:10:59,649
I'm well-educated,

251
00:10:59,651 --> 00:11:01,517
come from a good family...

252
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:03,586
Why don't women
want to be with me?

253
00:11:04,522 --> 00:11:06,789
An interesting
question.

254
00:11:08,191 --> 00:11:09,625
Well...

255
00:11:09,627 --> 00:11:11,761
good night.

256
00:11:11,763 --> 00:11:13,229
What?

257
00:11:13,231 --> 00:11:14,530
Don't send me home.

258
00:11:14,532 --> 00:11:15,931
I can't be alone
right now.

259
00:11:15,933 --> 00:11:17,800
That's your problem.

260
00:11:17,802 --> 00:11:19,001
You can't be alone.

261
00:11:19,003 --> 00:11:20,603
What do you mean?

262
00:11:22,606 --> 00:11:25,041
How many women have
you had dates with?

263
00:11:26,476 --> 00:11:27,443
Eleven.

264
00:11:27,445 --> 00:11:29,345
How many of
those women

265
00:11:29,347 --> 00:11:31,881
did you think would become
your perfect companion?

266
00:11:33,016 --> 00:11:34,183
Eleven.

267
00:11:35,252 --> 00:11:36,285
Wait.

268
00:11:36,287 --> 00:11:38,220
Do I count the 200-pound
Sailor Moon girl

269
00:11:38,222 --> 00:11:41,023
that Howard and I had
a threesome with at Comic Con?

270
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:45,695
Sure.

271
00:11:46,530 --> 00:11:47,663
I'll stick with 11.

272
00:11:47,665 --> 00:11:50,032
She liked Howard better.

273
00:11:51,902 --> 00:11:54,236
Well, now do you
see the problem?

274
00:11:55,505 --> 00:11:56,772
Maybe.

275
00:11:56,774 --> 00:11:58,407
I... I don't know.

276
00:11:58,409 --> 00:11:59,642
You... It's late,
I-I should...

277
00:11:59,644 --> 00:12:01,844
I should go.

278
00:12:05,416 --> 00:12:06,382
Look,

279
00:12:06,384 --> 00:12:08,184
I-I do get what you're saying.

280
00:12:08,186 --> 00:12:09,318
Instead of desperately clinging

281
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:11,187
to any woman
who will go out with me,

282
00:12:11,189 --> 00:12:13,789
I need to work on
my fear of being alone.

283
00:12:14,958 --> 00:12:17,593
I was trying to suggest
chemical castration, but...

284
00:12:19,830 --> 00:12:21,097
...it's my bedtime,

285
00:12:21,099 --> 00:12:22,465
so whatever gets you
out the door.

286
00:12:22,467 --> 00:12:24,667
Good night.

287
00:12:27,637 --> 00:12:29,739
Howie, I'm back!

288
00:12:29,741 --> 00:12:32,074
Shh-shh-shh,
I just got her to sleep.

289
00:12:32,076 --> 00:12:33,342
Sorry.

290
00:12:33,344 --> 00:12:34,410
What took you so long?

291
00:12:34,412 --> 00:12:36,011
The grocery store
is a few blocks away.

292
00:12:36,013 --> 00:12:37,346
They only had
regular yogurt.

293
00:12:37,348 --> 00:12:39,115
I had to go to
a different store

294
00:12:39,117 --> 00:12:41,317
to get the extra-fat
kind your mom likes.

295
00:12:42,219 --> 00:12:44,353
Then why do I smell coffee
on your breath?

296
00:12:44,355 --> 00:12:45,554
So what?

297
00:12:45,556 --> 00:12:47,156
After two days of
taking care of her,

298
00:12:47,158 --> 00:12:49,058
excuse me for stopping
to get a mocha.

299
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:50,326
A mocha?

300
00:12:50,328 --> 00:12:53,195
Well, it must be nice
to be queen.

301
00:12:53,197 --> 00:12:54,697
Queen?

302
00:12:54,699 --> 00:12:56,665
I've been killing
myself here!

303
00:12:56,667 --> 00:12:57,733
Well, whose fault is that?

304
00:12:57,735 --> 00:12:59,402
I wanted to get a nurse,
but you were all,

305
00:12:59,404 --> 00:13:01,924
"I'm nice.
I want to take care of people."

306
00:13:03,707 --> 00:13:05,441
I'm glad I got that mocha.

307
00:13:05,443 --> 00:13:07,243
And you know what
else I'm glad about?

308
00:13:07,245 --> 00:13:11,447
I bought you a brownie
and I ate it in the car!

309
00:13:13,950 --> 00:13:15,851
Howard!

310
00:13:15,853 --> 00:13:17,386
Thanks a lot.

311
00:13:17,388 --> 00:13:19,488
Now I have to go
rub her belly again.

312
00:13:27,531 --> 00:13:28,564
Hey.

313
00:13:28,566 --> 00:13:30,199
Thanks for letting me come over.

314
00:13:30,201 --> 00:13:31,434
Of course.

315
00:13:31,436 --> 00:13:33,602
Please, come in.

316
00:13:34,938 --> 00:13:36,172
I just wanted to say

317
00:13:36,174 --> 00:13:38,774
how sorry I am about tonight,
and...

318
00:13:38,776 --> 00:13:40,743
I want to make sure
that we're okay.

319
00:13:40,745 --> 00:13:42,912
Uh, look, you and I haven't made

320
00:13:42,914 --> 00:13:44,814
any commitments to each other.
I know.

321
00:13:44,816 --> 00:13:46,916
I just felt like
I needed to explain.

322
00:13:46,918 --> 00:13:48,818
The guy I was with
did my last tattoo,

323
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:50,252
and he's been asking
me out for months.

324
00:13:50,254 --> 00:13:52,721
I finally said yes
just to get it over with.

325
00:13:52,723 --> 00:13:54,390
It's okay.

326
00:13:54,392 --> 00:13:55,691
Really?

327
00:13:55,693 --> 00:13:58,427
Well, I mean, yeah,
it freaked me out a little,

328
00:13:58,429 --> 00:14:01,030
but that's my issue, not yours.

329
00:14:01,032 --> 00:14:02,965
Wow.

330
00:14:02,967 --> 00:14:04,800
If I saw you out
with another woman,

331
00:14:04,802 --> 00:14:06,502
I'd be pretty upset.

332
00:14:06,504 --> 00:14:09,438
Thank you.

333
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:11,774
Not just for being upset,

334
00:14:11,776 --> 00:14:14,043
but for believing
that could happen.

335
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:19,949
Just so you know,
I'm not seeing anyone else.

336
00:14:19,951 --> 00:14:22,117
Well, me, neither.

337
00:14:22,119 --> 00:14:23,219
Okay.

338
00:14:23,221 --> 00:14:25,221
Okay.

339
00:14:25,223 --> 00:14:26,722
Please.

340
00:14:26,724 --> 00:14:29,291
So, uh... you...
you have tattoos?

341
00:14:29,293 --> 00:14:30,259
Yeah.

342
00:14:30,261 --> 00:14:32,595
I don't.

343
00:14:32,597 --> 00:14:34,230
I have a hole
in my belly button

344
00:14:34,232 --> 00:14:37,266
that may or may not
have been a piercing.

345
00:14:37,268 --> 00:14:38,501
That's cool.

346
00:14:38,503 --> 00:14:40,569
It's a piercing.

347
00:14:41,805 --> 00:14:42,771
So, uh...

348
00:14:42,773 --> 00:14:44,139
how many tattoos?

349
00:14:44,141 --> 00:14:46,408
One on my shoulder,

350
00:14:46,410 --> 00:14:48,377
one not on my shoulder

351
00:14:48,379 --> 00:14:51,881
and one <i>really</i> not
on my shoulder.

352
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:54,783
It's, uh...

353
00:14:54,785 --> 00:14:57,052
been a long time since
I've seen a girl's...

354
00:14:57,054 --> 00:14:58,954
really not her shoulder.

355
00:15:00,291 --> 00:15:03,125
Well...

356
00:15:03,127 --> 00:15:05,160
how about you show
me your piercing

357
00:15:05,162 --> 00:15:07,396
and I show you
my tattoos?

358
00:15:13,937 --> 00:15:15,604
But, uh, before
I take my shirt off,

359
00:15:15,606 --> 00:15:18,140
I just need like ten minutes
to do some crunches.

360
00:15:24,381 --> 00:15:26,382
Oh, my God.

361
00:15:26,384 --> 00:15:29,184
What a day.

362
00:15:29,186 --> 00:15:30,452
Can I get you anything?

363
00:15:30,454 --> 00:15:33,255
No.

364
00:15:33,257 --> 00:15:35,925
I need to start making
some smart decisions.

365
00:15:35,927 --> 00:15:37,426
With your career?

366
00:15:37,428 --> 00:15:38,994
With my life.

367
00:15:38,996 --> 00:15:40,996
Like what?

368
00:15:40,998 --> 00:15:43,198
I don't know.

369
00:15:44,301 --> 00:15:46,001
We could get married.

370
00:15:46,003 --> 00:15:47,770
Come on, be serious.

371
00:15:47,772 --> 00:15:48,938
I am.

372
00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:50,539
Why?

373
00:15:50,541 --> 00:15:53,442
Because I'm
a-a "smart decision"?

374
00:15:53,444 --> 00:15:54,677
Well, yeah.

375
00:15:55,512 --> 00:15:58,047
So I'm like a bran muffin.

376
00:15:59,583 --> 00:16:00,683
What...

377
00:16:00,685 --> 00:16:01,817
No, that's not what I'm saying.

378
00:16:01,819 --> 00:16:03,085
No, it's exactly
what you're saying.

379
00:16:03,087 --> 00:16:04,620
I'm the boring thing
you're choosing

380
00:16:04,622 --> 00:16:06,055
because I'm good for you.

381
00:16:06,057 --> 00:16:07,156
What does it matter?

382
00:16:07,158 --> 00:16:08,490
The point is, I'm choosing you.

383
00:16:08,492 --> 00:16:09,525
Well, it matters a lot!

384
00:16:09,527 --> 00:16:11,093
I don't want to be
a bran muffin.

385
00:16:11,095 --> 00:16:12,661
I-I want to be

386
00:16:12,663 --> 00:16:15,197
a... Cinnabon, you know?

387
00:16:16,032 --> 00:16:18,567
A strawberry Pop-Tart.

388
00:16:19,469 --> 00:16:20,703
Something you're excited about

389
00:16:20,705 --> 00:16:23,305
even though it could
give you diabetes.

390
00:16:24,207 --> 00:16:26,709
Sweetie, you can be
any pastry you want.

391
00:16:26,711 --> 00:16:28,444
No, no. No, it's too late.

392
00:16:28,446 --> 00:16:30,479
I-I'm your
bran muffin.

393
00:16:30,481 --> 00:16:34,016
Probably fat-free
and good for your colon.

394
00:16:34,018 --> 00:16:35,117
You know what? Forget it.

395
00:16:35,119 --> 00:16:36,151
I never should've brought it up.

396
00:16:36,153 --> 00:16:38,854
You know I want to marry you,

397
00:16:38,856 --> 00:16:40,089
but you're
only doing this

398
00:16:40,091 --> 00:16:41,190
because you got fired

399
00:16:41,192 --> 00:16:42,391
and you're feeling
sorry for yourself.

400
00:16:42,393 --> 00:16:44,360
Okay, it may look that way,
but getting fired

401
00:16:44,362 --> 00:16:46,261
from that movie was the best
thing that could have happened

402
00:16:46,263 --> 00:16:47,663
to me, okay?
I finally realize

403
00:16:47,665 --> 00:16:49,064
I don't need to be famous

404
00:16:49,066 --> 00:16:50,699
or have some big career
to be happy.

405
00:16:50,701 --> 00:16:51,834
Then what <i>do</i> you need?

406
00:16:51,836 --> 00:16:54,737
You, you stupid Pop-Tart!

407
00:16:59,709 --> 00:17:01,577
Oh.

408
00:17:02,746 --> 00:17:05,681
Then I guess I'm in.

409
00:17:06,549 --> 00:17:07,449
Really?

410
00:17:07,451 --> 00:17:08,784
You "guess you're in"?

411
00:17:10,186 --> 00:17:11,754
Not like, "I guess I'm in."

412
00:17:11,756 --> 00:17:14,423
Like "I guess... I'm in!"

413
00:17:15,725 --> 00:17:16,925
Okay.

414
00:17:16,927 --> 00:17:18,961
Cool.

415
00:17:22,332 --> 00:17:23,899
So is that it?

416
00:17:23,901 --> 00:17:25,134
Are... are we engaged?

417
00:17:26,102 --> 00:17:27,803
Yeah, I think so.

418
00:17:29,606 --> 00:17:31,106
All right.

419
00:17:33,243 --> 00:17:34,810
What's wrong?

420
00:17:34,812 --> 00:17:36,478
I'm not sure.

421
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:40,149
Just... feels
a little anticlimactic.

422
00:17:41,484 --> 00:17:43,686
Yeah, it kind of does, huh?

423
00:17:44,954 --> 00:17:46,922
Oh, I know.

424
00:17:48,725 --> 00:17:50,893
This might help.

425
00:17:54,698 --> 00:17:56,999
Where did you get a ring?

426
00:17:57,001 --> 00:17:58,634
I've...

427
00:17:58,636 --> 00:18:00,836
had it for a couple years,
not important.

428
00:18:06,209 --> 00:18:07,743
Penny...

429
00:18:07,745 --> 00:18:09,278
will you marry me?

430
00:18:10,847 --> 00:18:12,481
Oh, my God, yes.

431
00:18:16,754 --> 00:18:18,420
This would have been
so much more romantic

432
00:18:18,422 --> 00:18:20,589
if you didn't have
monkey hair on your finger.

434
00:18:33,935 --> 00:18:35,402
How you feeling?

435
00:18:35,404 --> 00:18:37,238
Last night was
a little rough,

436
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:39,807
but I think we're
gonna get through this.

437
00:18:39,809 --> 00:18:41,108
I'm proud of us.

438
00:18:41,110 --> 00:18:42,977
Me, too.

439
00:18:42,979 --> 00:18:45,212
Where's my pancakes?!

440
00:18:45,214 --> 00:18:47,781
Coming, Mrs. Wolowitz!

441
00:18:53,455 --> 00:18:54,555
You were right.

442
00:18:54,557 --> 00:18:56,156
