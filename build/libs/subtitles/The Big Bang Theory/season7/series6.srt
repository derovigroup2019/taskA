1
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:04,200
What are you
working on?

2
00:00:04,202 --> 00:00:06,486
Can't talk.
In the zone.

3
00:00:06,488 --> 00:00:07,487
Do you know
what he's doing?

4
00:00:07,489 --> 00:00:09,122
Could be anything.

5
00:00:09,124 --> 00:00:10,623
Last time he was like this,
he figured out

6
00:00:10,625 --> 00:00:12,274
electron transport in graphene.

7
00:00:12,276 --> 00:00:14,110
The time before that,
he was making a list

8
00:00:14,112 --> 00:00:17,580
of who's allowed in his
tree fort if fe ever gets one.

9
00:00:17,582 --> 00:00:19,999
Still can't believe
I didn't make the cut.

10
00:00:20,884 --> 00:00:22,668
Uh, Sheldon,
you want to take a break?

11
00:00:22,670 --> 00:00:23,636
Your food's ready.

12
00:00:23,638 --> 00:00:25,004
No, no,
what are you doing?

13
00:00:25,006 --> 00:00:27,423
He's both happy and quiet.

14
00:00:27,425 --> 00:00:30,760
It's like seeing a unicorn
and Bigfoot at the same time.

15
00:00:31,595 --> 00:00:33,763
Sorry we're so late.

16
00:00:33,765 --> 00:00:35,014
Bernadette got
stuck at work.

17
00:00:35,016 --> 00:00:36,182
Great news!

18
00:00:36,184 --> 00:00:38,851
A raccoon virus just
crossed the species barrier

19
00:00:38,853 --> 00:00:41,637
and now can infect humans!

20
00:00:42,406 --> 00:00:44,273
Why is that great news?

21
00:00:44,275 --> 00:00:45,992
In the pharmaceutical business,
we have a saying:

22
00:00:45,994 --> 00:00:47,577
"Mo' infections, mo' money."

23
00:00:49,029 --> 00:00:50,312
Wait!

24
00:00:50,314 --> 00:00:51,447
Maybe you want to wash

25
00:00:51,449 --> 00:00:53,116
your little raccoon
hands first.

26
00:00:53,118 --> 00:00:54,150
Oh, calm down.

27
00:00:54,152 --> 00:00:56,035
If I had it,
I'd be dead already.

28
00:00:58,422 --> 00:01:00,006
Guys, listen up.

29
00:01:00,008 --> 00:01:01,374
Can't listen, zone.

30
00:01:02,325 --> 00:01:03,993
Also don't care.

31
00:01:03,995 --> 00:01:05,795
Next week is the anniversary

32
00:01:05,797 --> 00:01:07,346
of my first date
with Bernadette.

33
00:01:07,348 --> 00:01:09,599
Really don't care.

34
00:01:09,601 --> 00:01:10,683
I want to do something special,

35
00:01:10,685 --> 00:01:12,835
and I was hoping
you guys could be a part of it.

36
00:01:12,837 --> 00:01:14,003
Aw, what horrible thing

37
00:01:14,005 --> 00:01:15,888
are you trying
to make up for?

38
00:01:15,890 --> 00:01:17,440
Just putting something
in the bank

39
00:01:17,442 --> 00:01:19,108
for what horrible thing
I do next.

40
00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:21,144
Ah.

41
00:01:21,146 --> 00:01:23,179
Look, she's gonna be back
any second, so here's the deal:

42
00:01:23,181 --> 00:01:24,614
I'm writing a song,
and I was hoping

43
00:01:24,616 --> 00:01:26,315
we could all play it
for her together.

44
00:01:26,317 --> 00:01:27,617
Aw...
Oh, I love that.

45
00:01:27,619 --> 00:01:28,651
That is so beautiful.

46
00:01:28,653 --> 00:01:30,269
Sheldon?

47
00:01:31,188 --> 00:01:33,689
When did we get to
The Cheesecake Factory?

48
00:01:34,741 --> 00:01:38,360
? Our whole universe
was in a hot, dense state ?

49
00:01:38,362 --> 00:01:41,697
? Then nearly 14 billion years
ago expansion started... Wait! ?

50
00:01:41,699 --> 00:01:43,332
? The Earth began to cool

51
00:01:43,334 --> 00:01:45,868
? The autotrophs began to drool,
Neanderthals developed tools ?

52
00:01:45,870 --> 00:01:48,537
? We built the Wall
? <i>We built the pyramids</i> ?

53
00:01:48,539 --> 00:01:51,190
? Math, Science, History,
unraveling the mystery ?

54
00:01:51,192 --> 00:01:53,092
? That all started
with a big bang ?

55
00:01:53,094 --> 00:01:53,601
? <i>Bang!</i> ?

56
00:01:55,129 --> 00:01:59,129

58
00:02:04,181 --> 00:02:06,549
It's really sweet what Howard
wants to do for Bernadette.

59
00:02:06,551 --> 00:02:07,767
Yeah.

60
00:02:07,769 --> 00:02:09,435
Hey, how come you've never
done anything romantic

61
00:02:09,437 --> 00:02:11,604
to celebrate
our first date?

62
00:02:11,606 --> 00:02:14,190
Well, for starters, you've
broken up with me so many times,

63
00:02:14,192 --> 00:02:17,543
which first date
are we talking about?

64
00:02:17,545 --> 00:02:19,812
Ooh, somebody call
the burn ward.

65
00:02:21,698 --> 00:02:23,899
And back to the zone.

66
00:02:24,985 --> 00:02:27,770
And besides, I do romantic
things for you all the time.

67
00:02:27,772 --> 00:02:28,904
Can you even name

68
00:02:28,906 --> 00:02:30,706
one romantic thing
you've done for me?

69
00:02:30,708 --> 00:02:31,657
I can name tons.

70
00:02:31,659 --> 00:02:34,210
Sex doesn't count.
Oh.

71
00:02:34,212 --> 00:02:36,329
I know, what about
that bed-and-breakfast?

72
00:02:36,331 --> 00:02:37,546
Well, I took you there.

73
00:02:37,548 --> 00:02:38,497
All you did was...

74
00:02:38,499 --> 00:02:41,000
I know what I did.

75
00:02:41,002 --> 00:02:43,919
I bet they had to throw
out that rocking chair.

76
00:02:45,789 --> 00:02:48,290
You know, I can be
romantic if I want to.

77
00:02:48,292 --> 00:02:49,592
It's fine.

78
00:02:49,594 --> 00:02:52,511
And also not true.

79
00:02:52,513 --> 00:02:54,397
Okay, just you
wait and see.

80
00:02:54,399 --> 00:02:56,565
I'm gonna romance
your freakin' ass off.

81
00:02:57,901 --> 00:02:59,151
That's beautiful.

82
00:02:59,153 --> 00:03:00,152
Is that Shakespeare?

83
00:03:00,154 --> 00:03:01,970
Sheldon?

84
00:03:01,972 --> 00:03:03,906
Zone.

85
00:03:05,075 --> 00:03:08,310
He'll figure it out when
he falls off the roof.

86
00:03:09,496 --> 00:03:12,031
Sheldon, I know
you're in the zone,

87
00:03:12,033 --> 00:03:13,916
but do you
want some tea?

88
00:03:18,071 --> 00:03:20,172
All right, I can't believe
I'm gonna say this,

89
00:03:20,174 --> 00:03:21,674
but you haven't
spoken in hours

90
00:03:21,676 --> 00:03:23,158
and I'm starting
to get worried.

91
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:24,159
Please say something.

92
00:03:24,161 --> 00:03:26,262
Leonard, prepare
to be humbled

93
00:03:26,264 --> 00:03:29,548
and weep at the glory
of my genius.

94
00:03:30,767 --> 00:03:32,768
Nope, it was better before.

95
00:03:34,104 --> 00:03:35,438
Look at it.

96
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:39,275
I feel like my mind
just made a baby.

97
00:03:39,277 --> 00:03:41,560
And it's beautiful.

98
00:03:41,562 --> 00:03:43,011
It's not like human babies,

99
00:03:43,013 --> 00:03:44,964
which are loud
and covered in goop.

100
00:03:46,349 --> 00:03:48,016
Holy crap, Sheldon,

101
00:03:48,018 --> 00:03:49,668
did you just
figure out a method

102
00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:52,488
for synthesizing a new stable
super-heavy element?

103
00:03:52,490 --> 00:03:54,540
Did I?

104
00:03:54,542 --> 00:03:56,092
Well, that can't
be right.

105
00:03:56,094 --> 00:03:57,460
No one's ever done that before.

106
00:03:57,462 --> 00:03:59,128
Except me,
because I just did it!

107
00:03:59,130 --> 00:04:01,530
? Sheldon and
his brain-- yeah! ?

108
00:04:01,532 --> 00:04:03,249
? Sheldon and his brain--
yeah! ?

109
00:04:03,251 --> 00:04:04,884
? Sheldon and
his brain-- yeah! ?

110
00:04:04,886 --> 00:04:06,402
? Sheldon and
his brain-- yeah! ?

111
00:04:06,404 --> 00:04:07,803
? Sheldon
and his brain... ?

112
00:04:07,805 --> 00:04:09,839
Yeah, definitely better before.

113
00:04:11,058 --> 00:04:13,676
So I'm almost done writing
the song for Bernadette.

114
00:04:13,678 --> 00:04:15,043
Are you cool
playing the cello?

115
00:04:15,045 --> 00:04:17,897
If by "cool" you mean
"willing to," yes.

116
00:04:17,899 --> 00:04:19,849
If by "cool"
you mean "cool,"

117
00:04:19,851 --> 00:04:21,884
clearly you've never
seen me play the cello.

118
00:04:22,569 --> 00:04:24,520
Great.
Will you play the ukulele?

119
00:04:24,522 --> 00:04:27,406
Of course. I'd be happy
to shred it on my ax.

120
00:04:28,942 --> 00:04:31,861
Or you could just play
your tiny, ridiculous guitar.

121
00:04:34,698 --> 00:04:37,666
Fine. I will
melt her heart.

122
00:04:37,668 --> 00:04:40,068
And her face!

123
00:04:41,171 --> 00:04:43,038
Gentlemen.

124
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:45,424
Uh, no doubt you heard about
my little breakthrough.

125
00:04:45,426 --> 00:04:47,343
Now, if your plan

126
00:04:47,345 --> 00:04:48,961
is to hoist me
on your shoulders

127
00:04:48,963 --> 00:04:51,246
and carry me around the
cafeteria, please refrain.

128
00:04:51,248 --> 00:04:52,548
I don't care
for heights,

129
00:04:52,550 --> 00:04:53,799
motion sickness

130
00:04:53,801 --> 00:04:56,552
or the thought of your necks
touching my buttocks.

131
00:04:58,021 --> 00:05:00,473
Seriously,
congratulations, Sheldon.

132
00:05:00,475 --> 00:05:02,024
Yeah, I read
your paper online.

133
00:05:02,026 --> 00:05:04,310
That technique for creating
a new heavy element is inspired.

134
00:05:04,312 --> 00:05:05,311
Oh, well, thank you.

135
00:05:05,313 --> 00:05:06,445
Believe it or not,

136
00:05:06,447 --> 00:05:08,531
I just learned
a Chinese research team

137
00:05:08,533 --> 00:05:10,282
at the Hubei Institute
for Nuclear Physics

138
00:05:10,284 --> 00:05:12,151
ran a test on a cyclotron,

139
00:05:12,153 --> 00:05:14,153
and the results were
extremely promising.

140
00:05:14,155 --> 00:05:16,122
Sheldon,
that's incredible.

141
00:05:16,124 --> 00:05:18,273
Yeah, I know! They called it
the greatest thing

142
00:05:18,275 --> 00:05:20,209
since the Communist party.

143
00:05:21,211 --> 00:05:22,294
Although I'm pretty sure that

144
00:05:22,296 --> 00:05:24,046
the Communist party
made them say that.

145
00:05:25,281 --> 00:05:26,916
I like China.

146
00:05:26,918 --> 00:05:29,284
See, they know how to keep
people in line.

147
00:05:30,670 --> 00:05:32,120
So, what happens next?

148
00:05:32,122 --> 00:05:35,090
Oh, more testing,
more success, more fame.

149
00:05:35,092 --> 00:05:36,142
But don't worry,

150
00:05:36,144 --> 00:05:39,094
I will remain the same
down-to-earth humble Joe

151
00:05:39,096 --> 00:05:41,180
I've always been.

152
00:05:41,182 --> 00:05:42,297
- Good to know.
- Yeah.

153
00:05:42,299 --> 00:05:43,399
Now give me
that cookie;

154
00:05:43,401 --> 00:05:46,352
I discovered an element.

155
00:05:47,521 --> 00:05:49,722
Thank you so much
for coming.

156
00:05:49,724 --> 00:05:51,490
You called the right person.

157
00:05:51,492 --> 00:05:52,942
I believe I have
the perfect romantic evening

158
00:05:52,944 --> 00:05:53,993
for you to give Leonard.

159
00:05:53,995 --> 00:05:55,077
Okay, good,
'cause I've been

160
00:05:55,079 --> 00:05:56,695
really struggling
with this.

161
00:05:56,697 --> 00:05:57,947
As I'm sure you're aware,

162
00:05:57,949 --> 00:06:00,616
the quickest way to a man's
heart is through his...

163
00:06:00,618 --> 00:06:03,619
Pants, but Leonard says
sex doesn't count.

164
00:06:04,454 --> 00:06:05,754
Oh. You poor thing.

165
00:06:05,756 --> 00:06:07,489
You have one arrow
in your quiver,

166
00:06:07,491 --> 00:06:09,074
and you just can't use it.

167
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:13,161
Fortunately, another
pathway to a man's heart

168
00:06:13,163 --> 00:06:15,764
is through his stomach.

169
00:06:15,766 --> 00:06:17,266
I don't know if
I want to cook for him;

170
00:06:17,268 --> 00:06:18,267
he's kind of a picky eater.

171
00:06:18,269 --> 00:06:19,685
I mean,
"It's too salty.

172
00:06:19,687 --> 00:06:21,053
"It's too dry.

173
00:06:21,055 --> 00:06:24,006
It's too burnt and frozen
at the same time."

174
00:06:24,975 --> 00:06:25,975
Wait, come on,

175
00:06:25,977 --> 00:06:27,393
what else would
sweep you off your feet?

176
00:06:27,395 --> 00:06:29,645
Well, I've always had
this fantasy

177
00:06:29,647 --> 00:06:30,946
that involves dancing.

178
00:06:30,948 --> 00:06:33,515
The sexual chemistry

179
00:06:33,517 --> 00:06:36,285
between my partner and me
is electric.

180
00:06:36,287 --> 00:06:37,636
But boy, oh, boy,

181
00:06:37,638 --> 00:06:38,921
does my father not approve

182
00:06:38,923 --> 00:06:41,857
until he sees us
in the big dance competition.

183
00:06:42,926 --> 00:06:44,994
Okay, that's just
the plot for <i>Dirty Dancing.</i>

184
00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:48,214
What else would you love?

185
00:06:48,216 --> 00:06:51,000
Other than being lifted over
Patrick Swayze's head.

186
00:06:51,002 --> 00:06:54,036
Oh! Oh, uh, you could, uh,
stand outside his window

187
00:06:54,038 --> 00:06:56,989
with a boom box in the air.

188
00:06:59,109 --> 00:07:01,210
That's from <i>Say Anything.</i>

189
00:07:01,212 --> 00:07:04,847
Look, I'm a lonely guy;
I watch a lot of movies.

190
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:09,001
Look, Penny, if you truly
want to be romantic,

191
00:07:09,003 --> 00:07:10,569
it needs to come
from you.

192
00:07:10,571 --> 00:07:12,771
I get that,
but why is this so hard?

193
00:07:12,773 --> 00:07:14,773
Well, you've probably
never had to do this stuff

194
00:07:14,775 --> 00:07:15,908
'cause you're
young and beautiful

195
00:07:15,910 --> 00:07:17,776
and men have always thrown
themselves at you.

196
00:07:17,778 --> 00:07:19,778
Hmm.

197
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:21,714
Yeah, I'm trying
to be sad about that.

198
00:07:21,716 --> 00:07:23,115
I can't.

199
00:07:27,454 --> 00:07:29,538
Let's see,
what's next?

200
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:30,506
Okay! Here.

201
00:07:30,508 --> 00:07:32,424
This is
the Magic Marker

202
00:07:32,426 --> 00:07:34,677
I was using when
I made the discovery.

203
00:07:36,245 --> 00:07:38,847
I don't think the Smithsonian's
gonna want your marker.

204
00:07:38,849 --> 00:07:42,468
And that's why you're not
on a list for my tree fort.

205
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:48,140
Ooh, guess who's
getting an article

206
00:07:48,142 --> 00:07:49,925
written about him
in <i>Physics Today?</i>

207
00:07:49,927 --> 00:07:51,477
I'll give you a hint.

208
00:07:51,479 --> 00:07:54,730
You measured the diameter of
his suspicious mole yesterday.

209
00:07:56,616 --> 00:07:58,417
Sheldon, I'm so proud of you.

210
00:07:58,419 --> 00:07:59,434
Well, you should be.

211
00:07:59,436 --> 00:08:01,487
My discovery is
spreading like wildfire.

212
00:08:01,489 --> 00:08:03,238
Unlike my mole,
which is holding steady

213
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:05,207
at the size of
a navy bean.

214
00:08:06,876 --> 00:08:08,127
What's next?

215
00:08:08,129 --> 00:08:09,995
This is
the very copy

216
00:08:09,997 --> 00:08:11,830
of <i>The Handbook of</i>
<i>Chemistry and Physics</i>

217
00:08:11,832 --> 00:08:13,832
in which I looked up
the reaction rates

218
00:08:13,834 --> 00:08:16,051
of mendelevium and...

219
00:08:17,737 --> 00:08:19,688
And what?
No.

220
00:08:20,757 --> 00:08:22,658
No, no, no, no.

221
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:23,676
What's wrong?

222
00:08:25,929 --> 00:08:27,680
I've made a horrible mistake.

223
00:08:27,682 --> 00:08:28,847
What are you talking about?

224
00:08:28,849 --> 00:08:31,633
This table--
it's in square centimeters.

225
00:08:31,635 --> 00:08:33,519
I read it as square meters.

226
00:08:33,521 --> 00:08:35,070
You know what that means?

227
00:08:35,072 --> 00:08:37,639
That Americans can't handle
the metric system?

228
00:08:39,192 --> 00:08:43,028
Amy, I was off by
a factor of 10,000.

229
00:08:43,030 --> 00:08:45,914
But the Chinese team
found the element.

230
00:08:45,916 --> 00:08:46,999
Yeah, well, they shouldn't have.

231
00:08:47,001 --> 00:08:48,450
My calculations were wrong.

232
00:08:48,452 --> 00:08:49,985
There must be some resonance

233
00:08:49,987 --> 00:08:51,704
between the elements
I didn't know about.

234
00:08:51,706 --> 00:08:53,372
So you just got lucky?

235
00:08:53,374 --> 00:08:55,657
Sheldon Cooper
does not get lucky!

236
00:08:57,961 --> 00:09:00,295
You and me both, brother.

237
00:09:01,214 --> 00:09:02,464
It doesn't matter.

238
00:09:02,466 --> 00:09:04,499
The element was found
because of you,

239
00:09:04,501 --> 00:09:05,634
and that's groundbreaking.

240
00:09:05,636 --> 00:09:06,719
What matters is

241
00:09:06,721 --> 00:09:08,187
the greatest
scientific achievement

242
00:09:08,189 --> 00:09:10,338
of my life is
based on a blunder.

243
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:13,275
I'm not a genius,
I'm a fraud.

244
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:15,644
You know, Sheldon,
in neuroscience,

245
00:09:15,646 --> 00:09:17,946
we're forever finding something
in one part of the brain

246
00:09:17,948 --> 00:09:19,481
that we thought was
someplace else.

247
00:09:19,483 --> 00:09:20,783
Oh, great.

248
00:09:20,785 --> 00:09:22,534
Now I'm worse
than a fraud.

249
00:09:22,536 --> 00:09:24,286
I'm practically
a biologist.

250
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:32,074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

251
00:09:34,135 --> 00:09:36,303
You got to stop beating
yourself up over this.

252
00:09:36,305 --> 00:09:39,223
I mean, you made a mistake,
but it was a happy mistake.

253
00:09:39,225 --> 00:09:40,925
There's nothing happy about it.

254
00:09:40,927 --> 00:09:43,861
I'm being given credit
that I don't deserve.

255
00:09:43,863 --> 00:09:46,831
Oh, people get things
they don't deserve all the time.

256
00:09:46,833 --> 00:09:49,433
Look at me with you.

257
00:09:49,435 --> 00:09:51,151
No, Leonard,
this is going to haunt me

258
00:09:51,153 --> 00:09:52,386
for the rest of my life.

259
00:09:52,388 --> 00:09:54,071
Every science classroom,

260
00:09:54,073 --> 00:09:56,740
every periodic table,
every textbook--

261
00:09:56,742 --> 00:09:59,577
this mistake will be
staring back at me

262
00:09:59,579 --> 00:10:03,447
Like that time you let
Koothrappali wax your eyebrows.

263
00:10:04,666 --> 00:10:07,618
I've got to find a way
to stop this thing.

264
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:09,236
Buddy, I don't
think you can.

265
00:10:09,238 --> 00:10:11,288
I mean, once it's out there,
it's out there.

266
00:10:11,290 --> 00:10:15,509
This thing is like the science
equivalent of a sex tape.

267
00:10:15,511 --> 00:10:18,012
You know, frankly,
I'd prefer a sex tape.

268
00:10:18,014 --> 00:10:19,847
You don't know
what a sex tape is, do you?

269
00:10:19,849 --> 00:10:21,248
No.

270
00:10:23,685 --> 00:10:25,636
Make sure you guys get
to the restaurant by 8:00.

271
00:10:25,638 --> 00:10:27,087
Bernadette's meeting
me there at 8:30

272
00:10:27,089 --> 00:10:29,189
and I don't want to blow the surprise.
We'll be there.

273
00:10:29,191 --> 00:10:30,391
Got it.

274
00:10:30,393 --> 00:10:32,693
Now, uh, I have a question
about the song.

275
00:10:32,695 --> 00:10:34,144
I was thinking
at some point

276
00:10:34,146 --> 00:10:36,597
I could bust out
a little rap.

277
00:10:37,449 --> 00:10:40,434
N-N-N-No...

278
00:10:43,738 --> 00:10:46,273
Come on, come on, you
haven't even heard it yet.

279
00:10:46,275 --> 00:10:47,825
Leonard,
give me a beat.

280
00:10:47,827 --> 00:10:49,627
I will not.

281
00:10:50,945 --> 00:10:52,079
Please?

282
00:10:52,081 --> 00:10:53,914
No, I want this
to be romantic.

283
00:10:53,916 --> 00:10:54,948
It will be!

284
00:10:54,950 --> 00:10:56,467
I don't call
anyone a ho,

285
00:10:56,469 --> 00:10:58,802
and the only time I use
the phrase "my bitch,"

286
00:10:58,804 --> 00:11:01,672
I'm referring to you.

287
00:11:01,674 --> 00:11:03,591
There he is!

288
00:11:06,227 --> 00:11:07,461
Stop it.

289
00:11:07,463 --> 00:11:08,962
Stop celebrating me!

290
00:11:08,964 --> 00:11:10,681
Woo!

291
00:11:10,683 --> 00:11:12,566
And no woos!

292
00:11:12,568 --> 00:11:14,635
Oh, not you, Dr. Woo.
You're fine.

293
00:11:17,939 --> 00:11:19,740
I want you all to know

294
00:11:19,742 --> 00:11:22,109
that you have no reason
to applaud me.

295
00:11:22,111 --> 00:11:24,361
My so-called
breakthrough

296
00:11:24,363 --> 00:11:25,913
wasn't the result of my genius.

297
00:11:25,915 --> 00:11:28,332
It was nothing more than
a boneheaded mistake.

298
00:11:28,334 --> 00:11:30,150
So please refrain

299
00:11:30,152 --> 00:11:32,169
from praising me for it
in the future.

300
00:11:32,171 --> 00:11:33,287
Wh... I don't understand.

301
00:11:33,289 --> 00:11:34,505
They didn't find the element?

302
00:11:34,507 --> 00:11:36,657
Oh, no, they found the element.

303
00:11:36,659 --> 00:11:39,159
No, no, stop it!

304
00:11:39,161 --> 00:11:40,327
I don't need
to take this admiration

305
00:11:40,329 --> 00:11:42,346
from the likes
of you people!

306
00:11:42,348 --> 00:11:44,965
How do I make them
stop loving me?

307
00:11:44,967 --> 00:11:47,217
Invite them
to live with us.

308
00:11:51,223 --> 00:11:53,173
Boy, Bernadette is
gonna love this.

309
00:11:53,175 --> 00:11:55,059
Yeah. It must be nice
to have someone

310
00:11:55,061 --> 00:11:57,277
do something
so romantic.

311
00:11:57,279 --> 00:11:59,513
Okay, you know
what's not romantic?

312
00:11:59,515 --> 00:12:01,181
Rubbing it in someone's face.

313
00:12:01,183 --> 00:12:02,282
Actually, it can be,

314
00:12:02,284 --> 00:12:04,652
but I told you
sex doesn't count.

315
00:12:06,321 --> 00:12:08,789
I'm getting worried
about Bernadette.

316
00:12:08,791 --> 00:12:11,358
I'm gonna call
and check on her.

317
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:13,043
The National Science Foundation

318
00:12:13,045 --> 00:12:14,912
wants to give me
a substantial grant.

319
00:12:14,914 --> 00:12:16,363
Oh, that's a big deal.

320
00:12:16,365 --> 00:12:17,381
I know.

321
00:12:17,383 --> 00:12:20,334
When will this
nightmare end?

322
00:12:20,336 --> 00:12:22,553
Hey, I get that you feel bad
about all the attention,

323
00:12:22,555 --> 00:12:24,388
but still,
what you did is amazing.

324
00:12:24,390 --> 00:12:25,756
We're really proud of you.

325
00:12:25,758 --> 00:12:26,807
I'm not.

326
00:12:27,676 --> 00:12:28,875
You're not?

327
00:12:28,877 --> 00:12:31,562
Sheldon, I've been
thinking about it,

328
00:12:31,564 --> 00:12:32,879
and you're right.

329
00:12:32,881 --> 00:12:34,348
You don't deserve
any credit.

330
00:12:34,350 --> 00:12:37,551
All you did was misread
some numbers on a table.

331
00:12:37,553 --> 00:12:39,386
A very easy table, too.

332
00:12:39,388 --> 00:12:42,773
Honestly, I'm
embarrassed for you.

333
00:12:44,859 --> 00:12:47,227
That's the most romantic thing
I've ever heard.

334
00:12:48,863 --> 00:12:52,299
Damn it, everyone's better
at this than me.

335
00:12:52,301 --> 00:12:54,334
Congratulations,
Dr. Fowler.

336
00:12:54,336 --> 00:12:56,020
You just made the fort.

337
00:12:58,206 --> 00:13:01,508
Guys, there w-was
an accident at Bernie's lab.

338
00:13:01,510 --> 00:13:03,293
Oh, my God,
is she okay?

339
00:13:03,295 --> 00:13:05,546
Yeah, but she's at
the hospital in quarantine.

340
00:13:05,548 --> 00:13:06,597
What?
Poor Bernadette.

341
00:13:06,599 --> 00:13:07,881
Oh, no.

342
00:13:07,883 --> 00:13:11,051
I hate to pile on the bad news,
but I just got a raise.

343
00:13:19,477 --> 00:13:22,362
Oh, my God, Bernie,
what happened?

344
00:13:22,364 --> 00:13:24,598
Well, let's just say
the next time you move

345
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:29,036
a dozen vials of raccoon virus
to the fridge, make two trips.

346
00:13:29,954 --> 00:13:31,555
You're sure you're okay?

347
00:13:31,557 --> 00:13:32,956
Yeah, it's just a precaution.

348
00:13:32,958 --> 00:13:34,241
If there was a problem,

349
00:13:34,243 --> 00:13:36,994
I'd be throwing up
out of my eyeballs by now.

350
00:13:38,279 --> 00:13:39,663
Sorry I messed up our date.

351
00:13:39,665 --> 00:13:40,831
, don't worry
about it.

352
00:13:40,833 --> 00:13:42,750
I brought the
date here.

353
00:13:42,752 --> 00:13:45,552
Guys, come on in.

354
00:13:45,554 --> 00:13:46,637
What's all this?

355
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:50,290
Well, tonight is the anniversary
of our first date,

356
00:13:50,292 --> 00:13:54,011
and I wanted to celebrate it
by writing a song for you.

357
00:13:54,013 --> 00:13:55,229
Howie.

358
00:13:55,231 --> 00:13:57,264
Sheldon,
get over here!

359
00:13:57,266 --> 00:13:59,900
She might be contagious.

360
00:14:01,069 --> 00:14:03,320
Don't you think I'm having
a rough enough day?

361
00:14:03,322 --> 00:14:05,105
Sheldon!

362
00:14:16,285 --> 00:14:18,085
? If I didn't have you ?

363
00:14:18,087 --> 00:14:19,753
? Life would be blue

364
00:14:19,755 --> 00:14:23,173
? I'd be Dr. Who
without the TARDIS ?

365
00:14:23,175 --> 00:14:26,493
Is it me, or does she not look so good?
Shh!

366
00:14:26,495 --> 00:14:27,828
? A candle without a wick

367
00:14:27,830 --> 00:14:29,179
? A Watson without a Crick

368
00:14:29,181 --> 00:14:32,299
? I'd be one of my outfits
without a dick-ie ?

369
00:14:32,301 --> 00:14:34,268
? I'd be cheese
without the mac ?

370
00:14:34,270 --> 00:14:36,386
? Jobs without the Wozniak

371
00:14:36,388 --> 00:14:37,938
? I'd be solving
exponential equations ?

372
00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:40,057
? That use bases
not found on your calculator ?

373
00:14:40,059 --> 00:14:42,643
? Making it
much harder to crack ?

374
00:14:42,645 --> 00:14:44,895
? I'd be an atom
without a bomb ?

375
00:14:44,897 --> 00:14:46,480
? A dot without the com

376
00:14:46,482 --> 00:14:50,016
? And I'd probably
still live with my mom ?

377
00:14:50,018 --> 00:14:53,320
? And he'd probably
still live with his mom ?

378
00:14:53,322 --> 00:14:56,523
? Ever since I met you,
you turned my world around ?

379
00:14:56,525 --> 00:14:59,793
? You supported all my dreams
and all my hopes ?

380
00:14:59,795 --> 00:15:02,880
? You're like uranium-235
and I'm uranium-238 ?

381
00:15:02,882 --> 00:15:08,034
? Almost inseparable isotopes

382
00:15:09,504 --> 00:15:12,923
? I couldn't have imagined ?

383
00:15:12,925 --> 00:15:15,809
? How good my life would get

384
00:15:15,811 --> 00:15:17,594
? From the moment

385
00:15:17,596 --> 00:15:19,263
? That I met you

386
00:15:19,265 --> 00:15:20,397
? Bernadette

387
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:22,048
Oh, Howie.

388
00:15:22,050 --> 00:15:24,484
? If I didn't have you ?

389
00:15:24,486 --> 00:15:26,436
? Life would be dreary

390
00:15:26,438 --> 00:15:28,605
? I'd be string theory
without any string ?

391
00:15:28,607 --> 00:15:30,324
? I'd be binary code
without a one ?

392
00:15:30,326 --> 00:15:32,276
? A cathode ray tube
without an electron gun ?

393
00:15:32,278 --> 00:15:34,862
? I'd be <i>Firefly, Buffy</i> and
<i>Avengers</i> without Joss Whedon ?

394
00:15:34,864 --> 00:15:37,247
? I'd speak a lot more Klingon ?

395
00:15:37,249 --> 00:15:40,667
? <i>Heghlu'meH QaQ jajvam</i> ?

396
00:15:40,669 --> 00:15:46,456
? And he'd definitely
still live with his mom ?

397
00:15:46,458 --> 00:15:48,008
? You turned my world around

398
00:15:48,010 --> 00:15:50,577
? You're my best friend
and my lover ?

399
00:15:50,579 --> 00:15:54,932
? We're like changing
electric and magnetic fields ?

400
00:15:54,934 --> 00:15:58,051
? You can't have one ?

401
00:15:58,053 --> 00:16:01,521
? Without the other

402
00:16:03,090 --> 00:16:05,475
? I couldn't have imagined ?

403
00:16:05,477 --> 00:16:08,478
? good my life would get

404
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:11,899
? From the moment
that I met you ?

405
00:16:11,901 --> 00:16:14,067
? Bernadette

406
00:16:15,737 --> 00:16:18,789
? Oh, we couldn't
have imagined ?

407
00:16:18,791 --> 00:16:22,292
? How good our lives would get

408
00:16:22,294 --> 00:16:25,746
? From the moment
that we met you ?

409
00:16:25,748 --> 00:16:29,049
? Bernadette.

410
00:16:35,306 --> 00:16:37,758
Howie, that was amazing!

411
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:39,426
Look, I'm shaking.

412
00:16:39,428 --> 00:16:41,595
She's sick,
I knew it. Bye!

413
00:16:45,767 --> 00:16:47,467
I have to say,

414
00:16:47,469 --> 00:16:50,988
this is the best Top Ramen
you've ever made.

415
00:16:50,990 --> 00:16:52,823
I discovered
a secret ingredient:

416
00:16:52,825 --> 00:16:54,741
the flavor packet.

417
00:16:55,326 --> 00:16:58,278
That sucker is well named.

418
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:01,665
All right, lover boy.

419
00:17:01,667 --> 00:17:04,167
Get ready, 'cause there is
a crap storm of romance

420
00:17:04,169 --> 00:17:06,086
coming your way.

421
00:17:06,088 --> 00:17:08,488
Stop it,
you're gonna make me cry.

422
00:17:11,293 --> 00:17:13,260
All right. You seem
pretty confident.

423
00:17:13,262 --> 00:17:14,661
Oh, I am.

424
00:17:14,663 --> 00:17:18,298
Maybe if you follow this trail,

425
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:20,183
you'll see why.

426
00:17:20,185 --> 00:17:21,818
Oh, rose petals.

427
00:17:21,820 --> 00:17:22,786
Yes.

428
00:17:22,788 --> 00:17:24,054
The most beautiful

429
00:17:24,056 --> 00:17:26,339
and shockingly expensive
of all the flowers.

430
00:17:29,343 --> 00:17:30,560
You made the bed?

431
00:17:30,562 --> 00:17:33,530
You really are pulling
out all the stops.

432
00:17:33,532 --> 00:17:36,033
Okay, I gave this
a lot of thought,

433
00:17:36,035 --> 00:17:38,402
and I finally found
something to show you

434
00:17:38,404 --> 00:17:40,370
how much I love you.

435
00:17:44,792 --> 00:17:46,877
Oh, wow.

436
00:17:46,879 --> 00:17:48,128
It's a first edition of

437
00:17:48,130 --> 00:17:49,880
<i>Hitchhiker's Guide</i>
<i>to the Galaxy.</i>

438
00:17:49,882 --> 00:17:53,050
I remember it was
your favorite book growing up.

439
00:17:53,885 --> 00:17:55,135
This is great.

440
00:17:55,137 --> 00:17:56,503
It... thank you.

441
00:17:56,505 --> 00:17:58,055
It's... so much.

442
00:17:58,057 --> 00:18:00,807
What?

443
00:18:00,809 --> 00:18:02,926
Nothing. I love it.
No.

444
00:18:02,928 --> 00:18:04,261
Something's going on.
What's wrong with it?

445
00:18:04,263 --> 00:18:06,146
I remember you saying
how great it would be

446
00:18:06,148 --> 00:18:07,264
to have a first edition.

447
00:18:07,266 --> 00:18:09,149
It's true, I-I did.

448
00:18:09,151 --> 00:18:10,484
I did say that...

449
00:18:10,486 --> 00:18:13,153
when we were at the used
bookstore together

450
00:18:13,155 --> 00:18:16,656
and I saw the first
edition and I bought it.

451
00:18:17,825 --> 00:18:21,194
Oh, my God,
I am the worst!

452
00:18:21,196 --> 00:18:22,913
No, no, it's okay.
It's really thoughtful.

453
00:18:22,915 --> 00:18:25,565
No, it's not! I mean...

454
00:18:25,567 --> 00:18:28,401
What's thoughtful
is everything you do.

455
00:18:29,754 --> 00:18:32,039
Here, you know what?
Look at this.

456
00:18:34,709 --> 00:18:36,510
Look, here's the...
the plane ticket you bought me

457
00:18:36,512 --> 00:18:38,712
when I was too poor
to go home for the holidays.

458
00:18:38,714 --> 00:18:41,431
And the rose you left
on my windshield...

459
00:18:41,433 --> 00:18:43,633
just because.

460
00:18:43,635 --> 00:18:45,552
Here's the-the thank-you
letter you wrote me

461
00:18:45,554 --> 00:18:47,554
after the first time
I slept with you.

462
00:18:48,923 --> 00:18:51,892
All 11 pages of it.

463
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:55,896
Can't believe
you saved all this stuff.

464
00:18:56,764 --> 00:18:58,281
Of course I did.

465
00:18:58,283 --> 00:18:59,783
It's you.

466
00:19:00,618 --> 00:19:02,569
Come here.

467
00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:06,239
Oh.

468
00:19:07,992 --> 00:19:10,460
Is that
a pregnancy test?

469
00:19:10,462 --> 00:19:11,828
Oh, yeah,
just the first one.

470
00:19:11,830 --> 00:19:13,296
I didn't save them all.

471
00:19:21,979 --> 00:19:25,615
I can't believe I read
this table wrong.

472
00:19:25,617 --> 00:19:28,468
I blame you.

473
00:19:28,470 --> 00:19:30,753
Me? What did I do?

474
00:19:30,755 --> 00:19:32,205
You distract me.

475
00:19:32,207 --> 00:19:35,041
I've been distracted since
the moment I met you.

476
00:19:35,876 --> 00:19:37,627
Sorry.

477
00:19:37,629 --> 00:19:38,795
Well, you should be.

478
00:19:38,797 --> 00:19:40,430
Because all I
can think about

479
00:19:40,432 --> 00:19:43,099
is how much I want
to kiss you.

480
00:19:45,436 --> 00:19:48,554
And not just on the cheek,
but on the mouth.

481
00:19:51,892 --> 00:19:54,110
Like mommies
and daddies do.

482
00:19:57,448 --> 00:19:59,699
Oh, Sheldon.

483
00:20:02,903 --> 00:20:05,121
<i>Amy?</i>

484
00:20:07,574 --> 00:20:10,126
Amy.

485
00:20:10,128 --> 00:20:11,944
Did you hear
what I said?

486
00:20:11,946 --> 00:20:13,346
Can't talk, in the zone.
