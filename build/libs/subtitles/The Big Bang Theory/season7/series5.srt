1
00:00:05,533 --> 00:00:07,401
Awkward silence.

2
00:00:07,403 --> 00:00:08,685
Sheldon on his phone.

3
00:00:08,687 --> 00:00:09,720
No touching.

4
00:00:09,722 --> 00:00:13,123
Somebody's having date night.

5
00:00:13,125 --> 00:00:15,209
It's actually steamier
than it looks.

6
00:00:15,211 --> 00:00:18,078
Sheldon's looking up the phallic
symbolism of root vegetables

7
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:19,797
in Renaissance paintings.

8
00:00:19,799 --> 00:00:21,448
Oh, no, I got bored
with that.

9
00:00:21,450 --> 00:00:25,419
I'm just browsing
cuticle scissors on Amazon.

10
00:00:26,371 --> 00:00:28,005
How do you
not tear off his clothes

11
00:00:28,007 --> 00:00:30,557
and take him right here
on this table?

12
00:00:30,559 --> 00:00:33,260
If you do that, I'll scream.

13
00:00:36,431 --> 00:00:38,632
Sheldon, I have some
exciting news to tell you.

14
00:00:38,634 --> 00:00:39,783
That makes two of us.

15
00:00:39,785 --> 00:00:41,268
My new cuticle scissors
will be here

16
00:00:41,270 --> 00:00:43,153
in one to two business days.

17
00:00:43,155 --> 00:00:45,722
Come on, one.

18
00:00:45,724 --> 00:00:47,825
I've been invited to
consult on an experiment

19
00:00:47,827 --> 00:00:50,194
at your university
for a few months.

20
00:00:50,196 --> 00:00:51,328
Isn't that great?

21
00:00:51,330 --> 00:00:52,913
We could have lunch together.

22
00:00:52,915 --> 00:00:54,315
We could carpool.

23
00:00:54,317 --> 00:00:56,467
You know, riding with Leonard

24
00:00:56,469 --> 00:00:58,736
has gotten
a little tedious lately.

25
00:00:58,738 --> 00:01:02,206
Th-The only car game he ever
wants to play is the Quiet Game.

26
00:01:02,208 --> 00:01:03,307
And he's terrible at it.

27
00:01:03,309 --> 00:01:05,459
I always win.

28
00:01:06,845 --> 00:01:08,729
So, you're okay with this?

29
00:01:08,731 --> 00:01:10,397
Well, why wouldn't I be?

30
00:01:10,399 --> 00:01:12,433
Well, this project
would have us working

31
00:01:12,435 --> 00:01:14,468
in close proximity
to one another.

32
00:01:14,470 --> 00:01:15,969
And there's the vulgar adage

33
00:01:15,971 --> 00:01:19,640
that one should not
defecate where one eats.

34
00:01:19,642 --> 00:01:21,975
My father used to say
that all the time.

35
00:01:21,977 --> 00:01:25,162
That and, um, "Who does one
have to orally gratify

36
00:01:25,164 --> 00:01:27,881
to get a drink around here?"

37
00:01:29,234 --> 00:01:31,719
But what does that have to do

38
00:01:31,721 --> 00:01:33,637
with you working
at the university?

39
00:01:33,639 --> 00:01:36,240
Sheldon, "Don't defecate
where you eat,"

40
00:01:36,242 --> 00:01:38,275
means don't have a
romantic relationship

41
00:01:38,277 --> 00:01:39,877
in the workplace.

42
00:01:41,079 --> 00:01:43,063
Really?

43
00:01:45,767 --> 00:01:47,384
Yes.

44
00:01:47,386 --> 00:01:48,469
Huh.

45
00:01:48,471 --> 00:01:50,788
Yeah, I always
took it literally.

46
00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:53,623
That's why I have never
once moved my bowels

47
00:01:53,625 --> 00:01:55,993
in this or any restaurant.

48
00:01:55,995 --> 00:01:57,945
Hmm.

49
00:01:57,947 --> 00:01:59,980
I'm relieved that you
don't have a problem

50
00:01:59,982 --> 00:02:01,265
with us working together.

51
00:02:01,267 --> 00:02:03,517
Not as relieved
as I'm about to be.

52
00:02:04,519 --> 00:02:06,754
It's a brave new world,
little lady.

53
00:02:09,190 --> 00:02:12,826
? Our whole universe
was in a hot, dense state ?

54
00:02:12,828 --> 00:02:16,163
? Then nearly 14 billion years
ago expansion started... Wait! ?

55
00:02:16,165 --> 00:02:17,814
? The Earth began to cool

56
00:02:17,816 --> 00:02:20,334
? The autotrophs began to drool,
Neanderthals developed tools ?

57
00:02:20,336 --> 00:02:23,003
? We built the Wall
? <i>We built the pyramids</i> ?

58
00:02:23,005 --> 00:02:25,689
? Math, Science, History,
unraveling the mystery ?

59
00:02:25,691 --> 00:02:27,574
? That all started
with a big bang ?

60
00:02:27,576 --> 00:02:28,342
? <i>Bang!</i> ?

61
00:02:28,343 --> 00:02:32,343

63
00:02:37,819 --> 00:02:39,386
Are you crazy?

64
00:02:39,388 --> 00:02:40,437
You don't want

65
00:02:40,439 --> 00:02:42,306
your girlfriend
at work with you.

66
00:02:42,308 --> 00:02:45,008
Hell Clam.

67
00:02:45,010 --> 00:02:46,527
Why not?

68
00:02:46,529 --> 00:02:49,113
Hairy Fairy.

69
00:02:49,115 --> 00:02:50,681
I think it could be romantic.

70
00:02:50,683 --> 00:02:52,650
You know, my parents met
at his place of work.

71
00:02:52,652 --> 00:02:55,686
Your father's a gynecologist.

72
00:02:55,688 --> 00:02:56,870
I know.

73
00:02:56,872 --> 00:02:59,823
What started as a pap smear
turned into a date.

74
00:03:01,293 --> 00:03:02,676
Which turned
into her working there,

75
00:03:02,678 --> 00:03:04,645
which turned into marriage,
which then turned into hatred,

76
00:03:04,647 --> 00:03:07,197
which continues to this day.

77
00:03:07,299 --> 00:03:10,067
Two-Eyed Cyclops.

78
00:03:10,069 --> 00:03:12,903
Would you please tell him
this isn't a good idea?

79
00:03:12,905 --> 00:03:14,271
No, no, I think it'll be great.

80
00:03:14,273 --> 00:03:15,889
Maybe next time he gets
conjunctivitis at work,

81
00:03:15,891 --> 00:03:19,943
she can hold his head and try
to put the drops in his eyes.

82
00:03:19,945 --> 00:03:22,429
Giant baby.

83
00:03:22,431 --> 00:03:24,281
That's a Raging Ogre.

84
00:03:24,283 --> 00:03:26,517
Yeah, I know.

85
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:30,687
I'm just saying, I'd never want
to work with Bernadette.

86
00:03:30,689 --> 00:03:32,656
Can you imagine seeing
someone all day long

87
00:03:32,658 --> 00:03:34,124
and then you're
supposed to hang out

88
00:03:34,126 --> 00:03:35,826
with them after work, too?

89
00:03:35,828 --> 00:03:37,494
Hold on. We do
that all the time.

90
00:03:37,496 --> 00:03:39,229
You and I work together
and play together.

91
00:03:39,231 --> 00:03:42,883
Yeah, I know, and it drove me
into the arms of another woman.

92
00:03:44,702 --> 00:03:46,720
Bipolar Bear.

93
00:03:46,722 --> 00:03:49,606
Well, I appreciate your concern,

94
00:03:49,608 --> 00:03:52,810
but I won't be seeing any more
of Amy than I already do.

95
00:03:52,812 --> 00:03:55,095
I assume we'll deduct
any extra time we spend together

96
00:03:55,097 --> 00:03:57,965
at work from our weekly quota.

97
00:03:59,884 --> 00:04:02,553
Please let me be there
when you tell her that.

98
00:04:03,521 --> 00:04:05,689
Why? So you can see the
look on Amy's face

99
00:04:05,691 --> 00:04:07,991
when she hears
my top-notch idea?

100
00:04:07,993 --> 00:04:10,577
Please, oh, please,
just let me be there.

101
00:04:12,547 --> 00:04:15,682
So, Amy, what are you gonna
be working on at Caltech?

102
00:04:15,684 --> 00:04:17,468
I'm leading a study to see

103
00:04:17,470 --> 00:04:19,369
if deficiency of the
monoamine oxidase enzyme

104
00:04:19,371 --> 00:04:21,445
leads to paralyzing
fear in monkeys.

105
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:22,340
Oh.

106
00:04:22,341 --> 00:04:25,159
If they're anything like humans,
the answer's yes.

107
00:04:25,161 --> 00:04:27,578
Wait, you've-you've done
this experiment on humans?

108
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:30,264
You mean like death row inmates
with nothing to lose?

109
00:04:30,366 --> 00:04:33,083
No, that would be unethical.

110
00:04:34,619 --> 00:04:36,587
You know,
not a lot of people know this,

111
00:04:36,589 --> 00:04:37,838
but the monoamine oxidase enzyme

112
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:39,790
was discovered by a woman,
Mary Bernheim.

113
00:04:42,277 --> 00:04:43,543
That's right.

114
00:04:43,545 --> 00:04:46,546
My phone is just
as smart as you guys.

115
00:04:48,317 --> 00:04:49,449
Amy, Bernadette, Penny.

116
00:04:49,451 --> 00:04:51,151
Amy, Bernadette,
Penny.

117
00:04:51,153 --> 00:04:53,537
Amy, Bernadette, Penny.

118
00:04:53,539 --> 00:04:56,306
He's never gonna
stop doing that, is he?

119
00:04:56,308 --> 00:04:57,441
I don't mind.

120
00:04:57,443 --> 00:04:59,109
I'm hoping to put
his love of repetition

121
00:04:59,111 --> 00:05:00,861
to good use someday.

122
00:05:03,247 --> 00:05:05,232
Hi. Um...

123
00:05:05,234 --> 00:05:06,400
I've reconsidered.

124
00:05:06,402 --> 00:05:07,901
Uh, you can't work
where I work.

125
00:05:07,903 --> 00:05:09,269
Enjoy the rest
of your evening.

126
00:05:09,271 --> 00:05:10,904
Sheldon.

127
00:05:10,906 --> 00:05:13,123
I-I already signed
the contract.

128
00:05:13,125 --> 00:05:14,524
I cashed a check.

129
00:05:14,526 --> 00:05:16,576
Mmm... you are not going

130
00:05:16,578 --> 00:05:18,428
to come out of
this looking good.

131
00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:19,663
Sheldon,
I don't understand.

132
00:05:19,665 --> 00:05:21,581
I thought you said
you were fine with it.

133
00:05:21,583 --> 00:05:22,699
Well, I was.

134
00:05:22,701 --> 00:05:24,334
But that was before
Howard explained to me

135
00:05:24,336 --> 00:05:26,470
how awful it would be
if he had to work

136
00:05:26,472 --> 00:05:28,138
with his significant other.

137
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:30,724
He said what?

138
00:05:30,726 --> 00:05:32,676
Now, don't be insulted.

139
00:05:32,678 --> 00:05:36,897
He just thinks too much of you
would be mind-numbingly tedious.

140
00:05:36,899 --> 00:05:40,067
Excuse me, I need to have
a chat with my husband.

141
00:05:40,069 --> 00:05:41,902
Yeah, well, now,
well... keep it short.

142
00:05:41,904 --> 00:05:45,439
Fr-From what I gather,
brevity is your friend.

143
00:05:46,574 --> 00:05:48,742
So, are we good here?

144
00:05:48,744 --> 00:05:50,327
No, we're not good here.

145
00:05:50,329 --> 00:05:51,828
I am working on this project.

146
00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:54,081
Yeah, and you can't tell her
what she can and cannot do.

147
00:05:54,083 --> 00:05:56,099
Last week, you told Leonard
he couldn't wear

148
00:05:56,101 --> 00:05:58,301
his Wookiee jacket
out in public.

149
00:05:58,303 --> 00:05:59,519
That's different.

150
00:05:59,521 --> 00:06:01,455
I'm not going to the mall
with someone dressed

151
00:06:01,457 --> 00:06:03,540
dumb space bear.

152
00:06:05,576 --> 00:06:07,627
Sheldon, you don't have to worry
about me bothering you.

153
00:06:07,629 --> 00:06:08,879
I'll be in a different building.

154
00:06:08,881 --> 00:06:10,747
And we don't even have
to have lunch together.

155
00:06:10,749 --> 00:06:11,865
Really?

156
00:06:11,867 --> 00:06:14,518
Yes. Before all things,
I'm a scientist.

157
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:16,970
I'm just there to do my work
and, with a little luck,

158
00:06:16,972 --> 00:06:19,606
scare the living crap
out of some monkeys.

159
00:06:19,608 --> 00:06:23,143
Hmm.

160
00:06:23,145 --> 00:06:25,812
You sure your mothlike
personality won't be drawn

161
00:06:25,814 --> 00:06:28,565
to this blazing fire
that is myself?

162
00:06:31,536 --> 00:06:33,787
More and more sure.

163
00:06:33,789 --> 00:06:36,873
Well, then, you
have my permission.

164
00:06:36,875 --> 00:06:37,958
I didn't ask
for your permission.

165
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:39,159
Too late. No backsies.

166
00:06:41,612 --> 00:06:44,414
No, no, listen to me.
Sheldon misunderstood.

167
00:06:44,416 --> 00:06:45,382
What I meant was,

168
00:06:45,384 --> 00:06:46,449
if we worked together,

169
00:06:46,451 --> 00:06:48,118
there'd be too much
of me for you,

170
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:50,253
not the other way around.

171
00:06:50,255 --> 00:06:52,723
Howard, if you're going
to lie to your wife,

172
00:06:52,725 --> 00:06:55,325
don't start the sentence
with "Sheldon misunderstood."

173
00:06:56,878 --> 00:06:58,011
That's a dead giveaway.

174
00:06:58,013 --> 00:06:59,930
Well?

175
00:06:59,932 --> 00:07:01,131
Okay, fine.

176
00:07:01,133 --> 00:07:02,899
I did say that,
and I think it's true.

177
00:07:02,901 --> 00:07:05,018
I think if we worked together
and lived together,

178
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:06,520
we'd get sick of each other.

179
00:07:06,522 --> 00:07:08,105
Yeah, but to be fair,
he only said the part

180
00:07:08,107 --> 00:07:09,189
about him
getting sick of you.

181
00:07:09,191 --> 00:07:11,024
For the love of God, why?!

182
00:07:15,213 --> 00:07:17,864
What exactly do you
think you'd get sick of?

183
00:07:17,866 --> 00:07:20,016
His only options here
are to fake a heart attack

184
00:07:20,018 --> 00:07:22,385
or have a real one.

185
00:07:22,387 --> 00:07:25,655
It-it's nothing
in particular. I...

186
00:07:25,657 --> 00:07:27,824
Is it my voice?
Am I too bossy?

187
00:07:27,826 --> 00:07:28,959
What...?

188
00:07:28,961 --> 00:07:31,878
My arm is feeling numb.

189
00:07:32,797 --> 00:07:35,782
Nailed it.

190
00:07:35,784 --> 00:07:39,386
That's the wrong arm for
a heart attack, doofus.

191
00:07:41,222 --> 00:07:44,357
My point is, I'm sure
there are things about me

192
00:07:44,359 --> 00:07:46,643
that would drive you crazy
if you had to deal

193
00:07:46,645 --> 00:07:48,395
with them all day long.

194
00:07:48,397 --> 00:07:50,597
Like looking me in the
eye and lying to me?

195
00:07:50,599 --> 00:07:52,149
Oh, well, come on, I just...

196
00:07:52,151 --> 00:07:55,402
Where am I supposed to
look when I lie to you?

197
00:07:55,404 --> 00:07:57,754
Find somewhere else
to sleep tonight.

198
00:07:57,756 --> 00:07:59,906
Oh, Bernie...

199
00:08:06,864 --> 00:08:10,467
If it makes you feel any better,
Amy and I are fine.

200
00:08:13,070 --> 00:08:15,238
I mean, really good.

201
00:08:17,475 --> 00:08:19,843
So, boys, how was
the pajama party?

202
00:08:19,845 --> 00:08:23,730
You guys jump on the bed
and sing into hair brushes?

203
00:08:23,732 --> 00:08:25,932
It wasn't a pajama party.

204
00:08:25,934 --> 00:08:28,435
It was just a couple of bros
hanging out, giggling,

205
00:08:28,437 --> 00:08:31,521
eating cookie dough
and watching <i>Princess Bride.</i>

206
00:08:33,074 --> 00:08:34,608
Please, stop talking.

207
00:08:36,244 --> 00:08:38,862
As you wish.

208
00:08:42,667 --> 00:08:44,734
I mean, you know, Sheldon,
none of this would've happened

209
00:08:44,736 --> 00:08:46,203
if I hadn't tried
to help you.

210
00:08:46,205 --> 00:08:48,788
Uh, it also wouldn't
have happened

211
00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:50,290
if, in the early universe,

212
00:08:50,292 --> 00:08:53,793
hydrogen was a little more
common or a little less common.

213
00:08:53,795 --> 00:08:56,279
This is fun. Your turn.

214
00:08:57,265 --> 00:08:58,598
Gentlemen.
Hey, Amy.

215
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:00,283
Hello.

216
00:09:00,285 --> 00:09:01,685
That was kind of icy.

217
00:09:01,687 --> 00:09:03,336
You two okay?

218
00:09:03,338 --> 00:09:04,354
Oh, we're fine.

219
00:09:04,356 --> 00:09:05,772
As Howard advised,

220
00:09:05,774 --> 00:09:07,974
she's merely respecting our
professional boundaries.

221
00:09:07,976 --> 00:09:08,942
Smart.

222
00:09:08,944 --> 00:09:10,544
Take relationship advice
from a man

223
00:09:10,546 --> 00:09:12,963
who spent last night
braiding Raj's hair.

224
00:09:15,432 --> 00:09:18,451
Yeah, you make
a good point.

225
00:09:18,453 --> 00:09:20,654
It would appear
I was worried for nothing.

226
00:09:20,656 --> 00:09:22,205
Look at her, desperately wishing

227
00:09:22,207 --> 00:09:24,157
she was over here
at the cool table.

228
00:09:26,577 --> 00:09:28,328
Don't worry, little moth.

229
00:09:28,330 --> 00:09:30,630
The flame will come to you.

230
00:09:32,833 --> 00:09:34,568
Oh, uh...

231
00:09:34,570 --> 00:09:36,386
on the off chance that
Bernadette doesn't call back

232
00:09:36,388 --> 00:09:37,771
and apologize,
how do you feel

233
00:09:37,773 --> 00:09:39,673
about Mexican food
for dinner tonight?

234
00:09:39,675 --> 00:09:41,841
I-I don't know.
Sounds kind of heavy.

235
00:09:41,843 --> 00:09:44,811
That's 'cause you always
fill up on chips.

236
00:09:44,813 --> 00:09:47,480
And this is Dr. Gunderson
from Stockholm.

237
00:09:47,482 --> 00:09:49,032
Ah, Sweden.

238
00:09:49,034 --> 00:09:50,734
Yeah, home of my favorite Muppet

239
00:09:50,736 --> 00:09:53,720
and, uh,
second favorite meatball.

240
00:09:57,141 --> 00:10:01,344
Okay, the Nordic reputation for
lack of humor is well-founded.

241
00:10:02,813 --> 00:10:05,582
Boy, is his name Gunderson
or No-Funderson?

242
00:10:06,834 --> 00:10:09,069
Where are we going
with this, Dr. Cooper?

243
00:10:09,071 --> 00:10:11,104
Oh, please, I'm your boyfriend.

244
00:10:11,106 --> 00:10:13,556
You call me Sheldon.

245
00:10:13,558 --> 00:10:16,159
That's right,
I am in a boy-girl relationship

246
00:10:16,161 --> 00:10:18,929
with this cute little
lump of wool.

247
00:10:18,931 --> 00:10:20,046
Sheldon...

248
00:10:20,048 --> 00:10:21,765
It's a physical
relationship, too.

249
00:10:21,767 --> 00:10:25,518
Hand-holding, hugging...
even on hot days.

250
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:27,387
Ow.

251
00:10:28,172 --> 00:10:29,539
Okay, here's a new one.

252
00:10:29,541 --> 00:10:31,141
Apparently now
we kick each other

253
00:10:31,143 --> 00:10:32,776
in the shin under the table.

254
00:10:34,478 --> 00:10:37,013
How do you like it
when I do it to you?

255
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:41,067
Not so much, huh?

256
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:49,074
Advertise your product or brand here

257
00:10:53,499 --> 00:10:55,884
Test subject D7,

258
00:10:55,886 --> 00:10:58,536
aka Betsy, fear response study.

259
00:10:58,538 --> 00:11:02,390
Image number one: Frenchman
on bicycle carrying baguettes.

260
00:11:05,394 --> 00:11:08,396
No visible reaction.

261
00:11:08,398 --> 00:11:10,765
Image number two: sousaphone.

262
00:11:13,235 --> 00:11:14,736
Still no reaction.

263
00:11:14,738 --> 00:11:15,737
Okay.

264
00:11:15,739 --> 00:11:17,372
Let's kick things up a notch.

265
00:11:17,374 --> 00:11:20,091
Image number three: crocodile
with a mouthful of monkeys.

266
00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:27,132
Okay, now we're talking.

267
00:11:27,134 --> 00:11:29,067
Dr. Fowler?

268
00:11:29,069 --> 00:11:31,136
What do you want, Sheldon?

269
00:11:31,138 --> 00:11:33,221
Well, I'm done
with work, so...

270
00:11:34,424 --> 00:11:36,358
Oh, sorry, sorry, sorry.

271
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:39,093
Sorry. Uh...

272
00:11:39,095 --> 00:11:40,528
Better?

273
00:11:40,530 --> 00:11:41,696
Oh, baguettes.

274
00:11:41,698 --> 00:11:43,898
Yes, I like baguettes.

275
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:46,100
What exactly
are you doing?

276
00:11:46,102 --> 00:11:48,536
Determining baseline fear levels
in capuchin monkeys

277
00:11:48,538 --> 00:11:50,872
by measuring their response
to visual stimuli.

278
00:11:50,874 --> 00:11:52,340
So, goofing off.

279
00:11:54,910 --> 00:11:57,579
As I was saying, I'm done
with work and Leonard's not.

280
00:11:57,581 --> 00:12:00,215
So good news,
you get to take me home.

281
00:12:00,217 --> 00:12:01,249
Play your cards right,

282
00:12:01,251 --> 00:12:02,751
I'll let you drive me

283
00:12:02,753 --> 00:12:05,837
past the lot
where the buses park at night.

284
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:07,639
I can't leave now, Sheldon.

285
00:12:07,641 --> 00:12:08,757
I'm very busy.

286
00:12:08,759 --> 00:12:10,558
Besides, why would I want
to do you a favor

287
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:12,577
after the way you treated
me in the cafeteria?

288
00:12:12,579 --> 00:12:15,129
Image number four:
boa constrictor.

289
00:12:18,968 --> 00:12:21,936
What on earth
are you talking about?

290
00:12:21,938 --> 00:12:23,488
My behavior
in the cafeteria

291
00:12:23,490 --> 00:12:25,306
was delightful.

292
00:12:25,308 --> 00:12:27,492
Maybe your friend
Gunderson needs

293
00:12:27,494 --> 00:12:29,444
to head over
to IKEA and assemble

294
00:12:29,446 --> 00:12:32,380
a sense of humor.

295
00:12:32,382 --> 00:12:34,365
You embarrassed me
in front of my colleagues

296
00:12:34,367 --> 00:12:35,983
on my first day here.

297
00:12:36,685 --> 00:12:37,786
Image number five:

298
00:12:37,788 --> 00:12:39,187
kitten in a teacup.

299
00:12:39,189 --> 00:12:41,389
Oh.

300
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:47,529
Oh... embarrassed you?
You know what?

301
00:12:47,531 --> 00:12:50,432
I don't have time for this.
Find another way home.

302
00:12:50,434 --> 00:12:53,451
I'm starting to get the sense
that you're angry with me.

303
00:12:53,453 --> 00:12:55,002
Really?
What tipped you off?

304
00:12:55,004 --> 00:12:56,054
Couple things, actually.

305
00:12:56,056 --> 00:12:57,171
Your tone of voice,
your body language...

306
00:12:57,173 --> 00:12:58,807
Get out.
Well, now, that.

307
00:13:00,676 --> 00:13:03,311
Image number six:
woman giving birth.

308
00:13:12,571 --> 00:13:14,188
It's 9:00.
Where you been?

309
00:13:14,190 --> 00:13:17,308
Oh, I had to take
the bus home.

310
00:13:17,310 --> 00:13:20,845
Fell asleep and missed my stop.

311
00:13:20,847 --> 00:13:22,647
Oh, no.

312
00:13:22,649 --> 00:13:26,634
Did you know that Los Angeles
has a Little Sri Lanka?

313
00:13:26,636 --> 00:13:28,987
I did not.

314
00:13:28,989 --> 00:13:31,005
Well, I do... now.

315
00:13:31,007 --> 00:13:33,708
They're a lovely people.

316
00:13:33,710 --> 00:13:37,378
Although terrifying when you
wake up face-to-face with them.

317
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:39,647
If you're hungry, I brought home

318
00:13:39,649 --> 00:13:41,633
some mutton and coconut milk.

319
00:13:41,635 --> 00:13:43,618
Why'd you get that?
You hate lamb.

320
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:45,687
I was asking for directions.

321
00:13:45,689 --> 00:13:49,207
Apparently, there was
a communication problem.

322
00:13:49,209 --> 00:13:52,327
I thought Amy was gonna
drive you home.

323
00:13:52,329 --> 00:13:53,611
Yeah, I thought so, too,

324
00:13:53,613 --> 00:13:55,780
but she's acting very strangely.

325
00:13:55,782 --> 00:13:58,783
I was discussing it with
a Sri Lankan fellow on the bus,

326
00:13:58,785 --> 00:14:01,870
and he hypothesized
that a tiger may have

327
00:14:01,872 --> 00:14:04,055
recently run across her shadow.

328
00:14:05,908 --> 00:14:08,343
Although he may have just been
trying to drum up business

329
00:14:08,345 --> 00:14:11,346
for his brother-in-law's
witch doctor practice.

330
00:14:14,266 --> 00:14:16,835
Okay, Sheldon, what happened
between you and Amy?

331
00:14:16,837 --> 00:14:20,572
Well, can you believe
she said I embarrassed her?

332
00:14:20,574 --> 00:14:22,657
Yeah.

333
00:14:22,659 --> 00:14:25,443
But you didn't
even hear the details.

334
00:14:25,445 --> 00:14:27,478
Sheldon...

335
00:14:29,248 --> 00:14:31,866
I've known you
a long time,

336
00:14:31,868 --> 00:14:33,284
and I'm going
to tell you this

337
00:14:33,286 --> 00:14:37,155
with all the love
I can possibly muster.

338
00:14:37,157 --> 00:14:38,156
Amy's right.

339
00:14:38,158 --> 00:14:39,607
You're wrong.

340
00:14:40,459 --> 00:14:41,659
But you don't even know...

341
00:14:41,661 --> 00:14:43,077
Doesn't matter.

342
00:14:43,079 --> 00:14:45,697
But, now, but in my defense...
Doesn't matter.

343
00:14:45,699 --> 00:14:47,932
You're not listening
to my side of it.

344
00:14:47,934 --> 00:14:50,268
Okay, fine, Sheldon.
What is your side?

345
00:14:50,270 --> 00:14:52,286
Well...

346
00:14:52,288 --> 00:14:54,789
Nope, got to go with
Amy on this one.

347
00:15:00,630 --> 00:15:01,679
Shrimp was spicy.

348
00:15:01,681 --> 00:15:03,114
You want a TUMS?

349
00:15:03,116 --> 00:15:04,432
You got
the tropical fruit kind?

350
00:15:04,434 --> 00:15:06,951
No, if I buy those, I just
go through them like candy.

351
00:15:06,953 --> 00:15:08,386
Tell me about it.

352
00:15:08,388 --> 00:15:11,105
One time, I swear
I pooped out a stick of chalk.

353
00:15:13,142 --> 00:15:15,360
I'll get it.
Thanks.

354
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:18,363
Hi.

355
00:15:18,365 --> 00:15:19,530
Oh, hi.

356
00:15:19,532 --> 00:15:21,699
I may have overreacted.

357
00:15:21,701 --> 00:15:25,620
Yeah, well, I didn't
handle it so great, either.

358
00:15:25,622 --> 00:15:28,039
It's just sometimes I feel
like you enjoy spending time

359
00:15:28,041 --> 00:15:30,091
with your friends
more than with me.

360
00:15:30,093 --> 00:15:31,910
That's not true.
It's not?

361
00:15:31,912 --> 00:15:33,595
You spend all day
together at work,

362
00:15:33,597 --> 00:15:35,713
and then you all hang out
at night playing games,

363
00:15:35,715 --> 00:15:37,231
going to the comic book store.

364
00:15:37,233 --> 00:15:39,851
Last week, you two got
a couples massage.

365
00:15:42,488 --> 00:15:45,056
So, when you said you wouldn't
want to spend that much time

366
00:15:45,058 --> 00:15:48,026
with me, it really
hurt my feelings.

367
00:15:48,028 --> 00:15:49,644
Oh, wow.

368
00:15:49,646 --> 00:15:50,979
Yeah, no, I get that.

369
00:15:50,981 --> 00:15:52,113
I'm so sorry.

370
00:15:52,115 --> 00:15:54,866
Starting tomorrow, I am
turning over a new leaf.

371
00:15:54,868 --> 00:15:57,986
Time with you is my
number one priority.

372
00:15:59,990 --> 00:16:01,689
Why tomorrow?

373
00:16:03,191 --> 00:16:05,510
Well, we're real close
to finishing off

374
00:16:05,512 --> 00:16:07,378
the new Batman game.

375
00:16:08,514 --> 00:16:11,666
It is awesome.

376
00:16:13,969 --> 00:16:16,004
Uh, you should probably
go after her.

377
00:16:16,006 --> 00:16:17,755
Should I go after you?

378
00:16:17,757 --> 00:16:19,924
No!

379
00:16:21,593 --> 00:16:24,095
Thanks for getting me
in trouble.

380
00:16:26,899 --> 00:16:28,266
Amy.

381
00:16:29,068 --> 00:16:30,284
Amy.

382
00:16:31,070 --> 00:16:33,104
Amy.

383
00:16:34,723 --> 00:16:37,325
Sheldon, what are you
doing here so late?

384
00:16:37,327 --> 00:16:39,193
I couldn't sleep
because I kept thinking

385
00:16:39,195 --> 00:16:41,446
about what happened
earlier between us.

386
00:16:42,247 --> 00:16:45,616
Also, I had one heck
of a bus nap.

387
00:16:46,752 --> 00:16:47,902
Oh, speaking of which,

388
00:16:47,904 --> 00:16:50,788
do you want some mutton
and coconut milk?

389
00:16:50,790 --> 00:16:51,856
No.

390
00:16:51,858 --> 00:16:54,625
Well, I cannot give
this stuff away.

391
00:16:54,627 --> 00:16:57,078
What do you want?

392
00:16:57,080 --> 00:17:00,648
Amy, this isn't easy to say.

393
00:17:01,767 --> 00:17:04,752
All relationships are difficult,

394
00:17:04,754 --> 00:17:07,689
but even more so
when you're in one

395
00:17:07,691 --> 00:17:09,524
with a person who struggles

396
00:17:09,526 --> 00:17:11,859
with everyday
social interactions.

397
00:17:11,861 --> 00:17:13,528
And frankly...

398
00:17:13,530 --> 00:17:15,146
who can strike some people

399
00:17:15,148 --> 00:17:17,665
as being kind of a weirdo.

400
00:17:17,667 --> 00:17:19,650
Sheldon...

401
00:17:19,652 --> 00:17:21,652
you're not a weirdo.

402
00:17:21,654 --> 00:17:24,272
I wasn't speaking about me.

403
00:17:26,308 --> 00:17:28,442
I mean, honestly,
there's no telling

404
00:17:28,444 --> 00:17:30,078
what will set you off.

405
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:32,296
You know, introducing
myself as your boyfriend.

406
00:17:32,298 --> 00:17:35,550
Giving you the opportunity
to drive me home.

407
00:17:35,552 --> 00:17:37,618
Breaking the ice
with your colleagues

408
00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:40,788
using ethnic humor,
the funniest kind of humor.

409
00:17:42,558 --> 00:17:44,225
What's your point?

410
00:17:44,227 --> 00:17:46,627
My point is, we're a couple.

411
00:17:46,629 --> 00:17:48,362
And...

412
00:17:48,364 --> 00:17:50,481
I like you for who you are.

413
00:17:50,483 --> 00:17:52,366
Quirks and all.

414
00:17:54,103 --> 00:17:55,653
I like you, too.

415
00:17:55,655 --> 00:17:58,189
Well, I should hope so.

416
00:17:58,191 --> 00:18:00,324
I don't see anyone else
banging on this door

417
00:18:00,326 --> 00:18:02,827
to put up with your nonsense.

418
00:18:06,982 --> 00:18:09,584
Not even a good-bye?

419
00:18:09,586 --> 00:18:11,085
You see,
that's the kind of thing

420
00:18:11,087 --> 00:18:13,621
that makes people
think you're weird.

421
00:18:13,623 --> 00:18:15,423
Poor kid.

422
00:18:15,425 --> 00:18:17,508
She just doesn't see it.

423
00:18:27,609 --> 00:18:28,692
I'm not apologizing
to Howard.

424
00:18:28,694 --> 00:18:30,343
He can come beg me
on his knees.

425
00:18:30,345 --> 00:18:31,695
Sheldon, too.

426
00:18:31,697 --> 00:18:34,197
If I see him at work,
I'm just going to ignore him.

427
00:18:34,199 --> 00:18:36,033
All right, don't worry.
I talked to Leonard.

428
00:18:36,035 --> 00:18:38,802
He is gonna sit the guys down
and set them straight.

429
00:18:38,804 --> 00:18:40,821
Laser's warmed up.

430
00:18:40,897 --> 00:18:41,929
Pull!
