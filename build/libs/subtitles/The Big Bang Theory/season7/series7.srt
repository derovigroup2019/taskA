1
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:10,601
I've never seen him
this happy before.

2
00:00:10,603 --> 00:00:11,752
That's because
you've never seen him

3
00:00:11,754 --> 00:00:14,105
on "Restock
the Medicine Cabinet Day."

4
00:00:14,107 --> 00:00:15,422
Look!

5
00:00:15,424 --> 00:00:17,892
A new topical antihistamine
with lidocaine.

6
00:00:17,894 --> 00:00:19,126
Wow!

7
00:00:19,128 --> 00:00:21,946
I can't wait until I get a rash.

8
00:00:21,948 --> 00:00:26,400
Oh, Gas-X has
a new ultra strength.

9
00:00:26,402 --> 00:00:30,488
I guess they really do
read their mail.

10
00:00:30,490 --> 00:00:33,124
Hey, isn't that
Professor Proton?

11
00:00:33,126 --> 00:00:34,775
Oh, yeah.

12
00:00:38,446 --> 00:00:41,399
Look at him,
just standing in line

13
00:00:41,401 --> 00:00:45,136
like he wasn't moderately
famous 30 years ago.

14
00:00:45,138 --> 00:00:46,671
Let's go say hello.

15
00:00:46,673 --> 00:00:48,956
Oh, maybe we shouldn't
bother him.

16
00:00:48,958 --> 00:00:51,125
I'm not going to bother him,
I'm going to talk to him.

17
00:00:51,127 --> 00:00:54,812
He thinks there's
a difference.

18
00:00:54,814 --> 00:00:56,063
Arthur?

19
00:00:56,065 --> 00:00:57,815
Arthur, it's me--

20
00:00:57,817 --> 00:00:59,150
Sheldon Cooper.

21
00:00:59,152 --> 00:01:02,770
You may not remember because
of your advanced age.

22
00:01:02,772 --> 00:01:06,440
Trust me, I... I remember.

23
00:01:06,442 --> 00:01:08,492
This is my girlfriend, Amy.

24
00:01:08,494 --> 00:01:10,861
Amy, this is television legend
Arthur Jeffries.

25
00:01:10,863 --> 00:01:14,982
His science show inspired
millions of children.

26
00:01:14,984 --> 00:01:16,483
Hold-Hold-Hold on.

27
00:01:16,485 --> 00:01:20,371
You... You have a girlfriend?

28
00:01:20,373 --> 00:01:23,040
Yes, and I've heard
so much about you.

29
00:01:23,042 --> 00:01:26,293
Hey look-- we're wearing
the same orthopedic shoes.

30
00:01:26,295 --> 00:01:30,330
I can't believe
I dress like a celebrity.

31
00:01:31,750 --> 00:01:35,770
O-Okay, I get it now.

32
00:01:35,772 --> 00:01:38,789
Dr. Jeffries, hello again.
Leonard Hofstadter.

33
00:01:38,791 --> 00:01:42,276
Oh, oh, right, I remember
your-your girlfriend.

34
00:01:44,012 --> 00:01:47,364
Is-Is she... is she here?

35
00:01:47,366 --> 00:01:49,150
No, she's not.

36
00:01:49,421 --> 00:01:51,459
So, what prescription
are you getting filled?

37
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:52,158
Sheldon.

38
00:01:52,183 --> 00:01:54,183
No. Wait, I want to guess.
Don't tell me.

39
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:58,042
I wasn't going to tell you.

40
00:01:58,044 --> 00:01:59,359
Sheldon, come on.

41
00:01:59,361 --> 00:02:01,195
No, no, no.
I'm really good at this.

42
00:02:01,197 --> 00:02:02,997
All right, give me a hint.

43
00:02:02,999 --> 00:02:06,533
Does it involve difficulty
initiating a stream of anything?

44
00:02:06,535 --> 00:02:12,273
Well, given my age, that's more
than just a lucky guess.

45
00:02:12,275 --> 00:02:13,891
Hey, Sheldon, let's go
mock the people

46
00:02:13,893 --> 00:02:17,044
buying homeopathic medicine--
you love that.

47
00:02:17,046 --> 00:02:18,429
But I'm hanging out
with my friend,

48
00:02:18,431 --> 00:02:19,379
and we're having fun.

49
00:02:19,381 --> 00:02:21,515
Look how happy he is.

50
00:02:24,686 --> 00:02:28,055
? Our whole universe
was in a hot, dense state ?

51
00:02:28,057 --> 00:02:31,859
? Then nearly 14 billion years
ago expansion started... Wait! ?

52
00:02:31,861 --> 00:02:33,393
? The Earth began to cool

53
00:02:33,395 --> 00:02:36,297
? The autotrophs began to drool,
Neanderthals developed tools ?

54
00:02:36,299 --> 00:02:38,249
? We built the Wall
? <i>We built the pyramids</i> ?

55
00:02:38,251 --> 00:02:40,968
? Math, Science, History,
unraveling the mystery ?

56
00:02:40,970 --> 00:02:42,953
? That all started
with a big bang ?

57
00:02:42,955 --> 00:02:44,910
? <i>Bang!</i> ?

58
00:02:44,912 --> 00:02:48,912

60
00:02:53,939 --> 00:02:57,491
Bernie's having a girls' night
on Friday at our place.

61
00:02:57,493 --> 00:02:58,742
You want to do
something?

62
00:02:58,744 --> 00:03:01,712
Actually, I'm busy.
Doing what?

63
00:03:01,714 --> 00:03:04,248
There's a new sports bar
over on Colorado Ave...

64
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:06,817
You're going to girls' night.
Yeah.

65
00:03:06,819 --> 00:03:10,120
You know they're making
jewelry right?

66
00:03:10,122 --> 00:03:12,573
You think <i>they</i>
came up with that?

67
00:03:12,575 --> 00:03:16,293
They were going to drink beer
and play darts.

68
00:03:16,295 --> 00:03:17,294
What's up?

69
00:03:17,296 --> 00:03:19,597
Not his
testosterone levels.

70
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:21,348
Excuse me.

71
00:03:21,350 --> 00:03:23,884
I happen to be very comfortable
with my masculinity.

72
00:03:23,886 --> 00:03:27,104
How is that possible?

73
00:03:28,808 --> 00:03:33,894
Hey, I got an email
from Professor Proton.

74
00:03:33,896 --> 00:03:35,779
Goody!
What's it say?

75
00:03:35,781 --> 00:03:38,065
He's working on a paper
about nano vacuum tubes,

76
00:03:38,067 --> 00:03:40,767
and wants to know if I'd
take a look at it.

77
00:03:40,769 --> 00:03:42,769
That's strange.

78
00:03:42,771 --> 00:03:45,623
That he would come to you
for that and not me.

79
00:03:46,608 --> 00:03:48,942
Oh, I got two emails from him.

80
00:03:50,161 --> 00:03:55,115
"Do you have Leonard's
email address?"

81
00:03:55,117 --> 00:03:56,700
And...

82
00:03:56,702 --> 00:03:59,286
"Never mind, I found it."

83
00:04:00,288 --> 00:04:03,173
I can't believe
he picked you over me.

84
00:04:03,175 --> 00:04:05,809
You don't want to read a paper
by some old has-been

85
00:04:05,811 --> 00:04:09,480
who hasn't done any real
science in decades.

86
00:04:09,482 --> 00:04:11,115
Yeah, it's nothing
to cry about.

87
00:04:11,117 --> 00:04:13,851
Sheldon Cooper does not cry.

88
00:04:13,853 --> 00:04:16,970
It's true, you'd rust.

89
00:04:20,392 --> 00:04:23,827
And to think I idolized
that man.

90
00:04:23,829 --> 00:04:25,496
And why?

91
00:04:25,498 --> 00:04:29,283
At the end of the day he's just
another Hollywood phony.

92
00:04:29,285 --> 00:04:31,335
Is it really worth
getting upset about?

93
00:04:31,337 --> 00:04:33,087
They say don't meet your heroes.

94
00:04:33,089 --> 00:04:34,705
Don't peek behind

95
00:04:34,707 --> 00:04:36,590
that curtain of fame
and celebrity,

96
00:04:36,592 --> 00:04:39,043
because if you do, you'll see
them as they really are--

97
00:04:39,045 --> 00:04:43,047
degenerate carnival folk.

98
00:04:43,049 --> 00:04:45,766
Come on, he's a retired
kids show host.

99
00:04:45,768 --> 00:04:46,717
That's even worse.

100
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:48,886
Using the sweet
candy of science

101
00:04:48,888 --> 00:04:51,305
to trick children
into loving him.

102
00:04:51,307 --> 00:04:53,507
Pervert.

103
00:04:55,226 --> 00:04:57,478
Have you ever thought about

104
00:04:57,480 --> 00:05:00,347
why Arthur didn't want you
to read his paper?

105
00:05:00,349 --> 00:05:01,815
Yes, I have.

106
00:05:01,817 --> 00:05:03,233
And my only conclusion

107
00:05:03,235 --> 00:05:05,486
is the prescription he was
picking up the other day

108
00:05:05,488 --> 00:05:08,021
was for cuckoo pills.

109
00:05:08,023 --> 00:05:11,408
Maybe he found you,
um, a bit much.

110
00:05:11,410 --> 00:05:13,877
That's kind of a stretch.

111
00:05:13,879 --> 00:05:15,529
Look, when it comes

112
00:05:15,531 --> 00:05:17,965
to social skills, I've
mastered the big three.

113
00:05:17,967 --> 00:05:19,833
There's the coy smile.

114
00:05:22,036 --> 00:05:23,470
There's the friendly
chuckle.

115
00:05:25,341 --> 00:05:28,892
There's the vocalization
of sympathy.

116
00:05:28,894 --> 00:05:30,728
Aw...

117
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:35,382
That last one's tricky,
I'm still working on it.

118
00:05:35,384 --> 00:05:37,318
From what I saw the other day,

119
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:39,937
I could understand
why he and...

120
00:05:39,939 --> 00:05:42,723
some people
might find you...

121
00:05:44,326 --> 00:05:46,060
What?

122
00:05:47,996 --> 00:05:48,996
Doesn't matter.

123
00:05:48,998 --> 00:05:52,065
No, go ahead, say it.

124
00:05:52,067 --> 00:05:54,001
I know what it is.

125
00:05:54,003 --> 00:05:55,502
I've heard it my whole life.

126
00:05:55,504 --> 00:05:56,587
The word's "annoying".

127
00:05:56,589 --> 00:05:57,755
Go ahead, say it.

128
00:05:57,757 --> 00:05:59,573
Say it.
Say I'm annoying.

129
00:05:59,575 --> 00:06:00,758
Sheldon...

130
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:02,376
Oh, it won't hurt my feelings.

131
00:06:02,378 --> 00:06:03,761
Go ahead, Amy, say I'm annoying.

132
00:06:03,763 --> 00:06:06,263
I'm annoying.
I'm annoying.

133
00:06:06,265 --> 00:06:07,865
I'm annoying.
Yeah, now, uh...

134
00:06:07,867 --> 00:06:09,133
Now where
are you going?

135
00:06:09,135 --> 00:06:11,251
Look, you know
you want to say it-- say it.

136
00:06:11,253 --> 00:06:13,637
Say I'm annoying.
Go ahead, say it.

137
00:06:13,639 --> 00:06:17,341
Say it. Say it.
Amy, say it.

138
00:06:20,111 --> 00:06:22,730
Well, she can't stand it
when I'm right.

139
00:06:23,898 --> 00:06:25,616
This is fun.

140
00:06:25,618 --> 00:06:27,901
I'm going to feel like
such a vixen wearing jewelry

141
00:06:27,903 --> 00:06:31,121
that doesn't have a list
of medications I'm allergic to.

142
00:06:31,123 --> 00:06:33,073
Penny, how's it
going over there?

143
00:06:33,075 --> 00:06:36,627
Good-- I'm just having
little trouble with the glue.

144
00:06:37,612 --> 00:06:39,213
How do you not know
how to use glue?

145
00:06:39,215 --> 00:06:41,365
Did you ditch pre-school?

146
00:06:41,367 --> 00:06:44,968
Yeah, but only because I was
dating a second grader.

147
00:06:47,255 --> 00:06:48,789
Hello, everyone.

148
00:06:48,791 --> 00:06:50,724
Okay, let me have it.

149
00:06:50,726 --> 00:06:53,460
Let's hear all
the "Raj is a girl" jokes.

150
00:06:53,462 --> 00:06:54,812
Nope.

151
00:06:54,814 --> 00:06:57,631
Bernadette told me it isn't
nice and I'm not allowed.

152
00:06:57,633 --> 00:06:58,649
Thank you.

153
00:06:58,651 --> 00:07:00,067
So I won't be making
fun of you,

154
00:07:00,069 --> 00:07:01,268
or the things you like,

155
00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:03,737
or the fact that you
just want to have fun.

156
00:07:05,774 --> 00:07:08,192
Howie, stop.

157
00:07:08,194 --> 00:07:10,360
Come on,
look at what I'm making.

158
00:07:10,362 --> 00:07:13,197
Oh, that's actually pretty nice.

159
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:14,314
I'm making a bracelet.

160
00:07:14,316 --> 00:07:16,116
Yeah, I'm just making a mess.

161
00:07:17,669 --> 00:07:21,388
You know, instead of
beads and glue,

162
00:07:21,390 --> 00:07:22,923
you guys can use
my soldering iron.

163
00:07:22,925 --> 00:07:24,591
You'd be able to make
much cooler stuff.

164
00:07:24,593 --> 00:07:28,161
Oh, I think we're doing
just fine, thank you.

165
00:07:28,163 --> 00:07:30,297
Actually, I'd kind of like to try that.
Me, too.

166
00:07:30,299 --> 00:07:31,432
Be right back.

167
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,686
When did I have pistachios?

168
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:41,842
Arthur.

169
00:07:41,844 --> 00:07:43,343
Arthur.

170
00:07:44,814 --> 00:07:46,480
Arthur.

171
00:07:46,482 --> 00:07:48,982
Door knocker.

172
00:07:48,984 --> 00:07:50,868
That's TV money.

173
00:07:53,288 --> 00:07:55,739
Sheldon,
what are you doing here?

174
00:07:55,741 --> 00:07:58,492
I'm sorry, did I wake you?

175
00:07:58,494 --> 00:08:01,295
Of course you woke me,
it's 7:30.

176
00:08:01,297 --> 00:08:04,364
Well, I would
have been here sooner,

177
00:08:04,366 --> 00:08:06,199
but for some reason your home

178
00:08:06,201 --> 00:08:09,503
isn't on this map
of Hollywood stars.

179
00:08:09,505 --> 00:08:11,505
What do you want, Sheldon?

180
00:08:11,507 --> 00:08:14,207
It's been pointed out
by my girlfriend

181
00:08:14,209 --> 00:08:17,478
that I may have been
annoying to you.

182
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:20,047
She sounds like a keeper.

183
00:08:20,049 --> 00:08:22,816
Anyway, I wanted to apologize.

184
00:08:22,818 --> 00:08:24,985
I am truly sorry.

185
00:08:24,987 --> 00:08:27,154
All right, apology accepted.
Have a nice night.

186
00:08:27,156 --> 00:08:30,491
No, no, now that...
we've cleared the air,

187
00:08:30,493 --> 00:08:33,243
I wanted to discuss another
matter with you.

188
00:08:33,245 --> 00:08:35,245
Sheldon, in a couple hours,
I have to get up,

189
00:08:35,247 --> 00:08:39,833
pee and then wander
around the house.

190
00:08:44,238 --> 00:08:46,540
Well, then,
I'll make this quick.

191
00:08:46,542 --> 00:08:49,910
Um, I want to talk about
the paper you sent Leonard.

192
00:08:49,912 --> 00:08:51,845
Now, I know he said
it's promising

193
00:08:51,847 --> 00:08:53,597
and he's going
to collaborate on it,

194
00:08:53,599 --> 00:08:56,049
but now that you and I
are friends again,

195
00:08:56,051 --> 00:08:57,518
I am at your disposal.

196
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:59,353
Frankly,
lending my name

197
00:08:59,355 --> 00:09:02,105
and reputation to it will help,
because a lot of people think

198
00:09:02,107 --> 00:09:04,474
that you're a washed-up
has-been.

199
00:09:04,476 --> 00:09:07,260
Or dead.

200
00:09:07,262 --> 00:09:10,898
I should be so lucky.

201
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:13,099
So, uh, what do you say?

202
00:09:13,101 --> 00:09:15,202
You know, if it's
all the same with you,

203
00:09:15,204 --> 00:09:17,237
I think I'll stick with Leonard.

204
00:09:17,239 --> 00:09:19,373
It's because
I'm annoying, right?

205
00:09:19,375 --> 00:09:21,241
I know it is.
Say it.

206
00:09:21,243 --> 00:09:22,943
Say it.
Say I'm annoying.

207
00:09:22,945 --> 00:09:24,294
Good night.
Say it.

208
00:09:24,296 --> 00:09:26,446
Arthur, say it.
Say I'm annoying.

209
00:09:26,448 --> 00:09:28,114
Say it. Say it.

210
00:09:28,116 --> 00:09:30,467
I'm annoying.
Say it.

211
00:09:30,469 --> 00:09:33,053
You're annoying!

212
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:41,074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

213
00:09:46,642 --> 00:09:48,692
If you would have told me
when I was a kid

214
00:09:48,694 --> 00:09:50,528
that someday I would
be doing science

215
00:09:50,530 --> 00:09:53,864
next to Professor Proton,
I would not have believed you.

216
00:09:53,866 --> 00:09:55,332
If someone had told me

217
00:09:55,334 --> 00:09:57,618
that people would still
call me Professor Proton

218
00:09:57,620 --> 00:09:59,453
when I was 83 years old,

219
00:09:59,455 --> 00:10:02,189
I never would have
quit smoking.

220
00:10:04,743 --> 00:10:07,378
I'm sorry, Dr. Jeffries,
I'm just excited.

221
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:10,748
This nano vacuum tube idea of
yours is really interesting.

222
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:11,749
Hello, Leonard.

223
00:10:11,751 --> 00:10:13,467
Oh, hello, Arthur.

224
00:10:13,469 --> 00:10:16,036
What an odd coincidence
that you're both here.

225
00:10:16,038 --> 00:10:17,388
Why is it odd?

226
00:10:17,390 --> 00:10:20,374
Because as it just so happens,
I'm also spending the day

227
00:10:20,376 --> 00:10:23,377
with a beloved children's
television science personality.

228
00:10:23,379 --> 00:10:25,596
Isn't that right,
new friend and colleague,

229
00:10:25,598 --> 00:10:27,731
Bill Nye the Science Guy.

230
00:10:32,387 --> 00:10:35,656
Sorry, I replaced you
with a newer model.

231
00:10:36,658 --> 00:10:38,275
Wow, Arthur Jeffries.

232
00:10:38,277 --> 00:10:39,559
It's an honor
to meet you.

233
00:10:39,561 --> 00:10:41,779
My show never would have
happened without yours.

234
00:10:41,781 --> 00:10:43,998
That's what
I told my lawyers.

235
00:10:45,566 --> 00:10:47,334
Mr. Nye, hello.

236
00:10:47,336 --> 00:10:50,087
I'm sorry he got you
involved in this nonsense.

237
00:10:50,089 --> 00:10:53,090
He said I'd be
speaking to a class.

238
00:10:53,092 --> 00:10:55,426
No, I said you were
teaching someone a lesson.

239
00:10:55,428 --> 00:10:56,627
Now let's go.

240
00:10:58,296 --> 00:10:59,763
What are you guys
working on?

241
00:10:59,765 --> 00:11:01,799
Oh, uh, we're making
nano vacuum tubes.

242
00:11:01,801 --> 00:11:03,050
Oh...

243
00:11:03,052 --> 00:11:04,584
That's interesting.

244
00:11:04,586 --> 00:11:06,303
Haven't you stolen
enough from me?

245
00:11:06,305 --> 00:11:08,806
Back off, bow tie!

246
00:11:13,895 --> 00:11:15,312
Hey, guys...

247
00:11:15,314 --> 00:11:16,947
What do you think?

248
00:11:16,949 --> 00:11:19,233
Wow, Penny,
good job.

249
00:11:19,235 --> 00:11:21,118
Thanks.
Target, $4.99.

250
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:22,286
I'm getting a drink.

251
00:11:23,855 --> 00:11:24,922
What are you working on?

252
00:11:24,924 --> 00:11:26,824
Oh, I'm making
a necklace for my mom.

253
00:11:26,826 --> 00:11:27,908
That's sweet.

254
00:11:27,910 --> 00:11:29,109
Yeah, she and
my dad are

255
00:11:29,111 --> 00:11:30,577
going through a bit
of a rough patch,

256
00:11:30,579 --> 00:11:31,629
so I wanted to do
something to let her know

257
00:11:31,631 --> 00:11:32,796
I was thinking
about her.

258
00:11:32,798 --> 00:11:34,081
What's going on
with them?

259
00:11:34,083 --> 00:11:35,015
They're just having

260
00:11:35,017 --> 00:11:36,550
a little trouble
communicating.

261
00:11:36,552 --> 00:11:38,719
My dad says it's because
the sound of my mom's voice

262
00:11:38,721 --> 00:11:40,054
makes him want
to tear his ears off

263
00:11:40,056 --> 00:11:41,121
and sew them
over his eyes

264
00:11:41,123 --> 00:11:42,640
so he never has
to look at her again.

265
00:11:44,810 --> 00:11:45,959
Hi.

266
00:11:45,961 --> 00:11:47,011
Hey, guys.
Hello.

267
00:11:47,013 --> 00:11:48,278
Look who's here to put

268
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:51,565
the "Jew" in "Jewelry Night"!

269
00:11:53,902 --> 00:11:56,186
Oh, sure, so it's fine
when you say it.

270
00:11:57,272 --> 00:11:58,238
Sorry we're late.

271
00:11:58,240 --> 00:11:59,606
I wanted to swing by the lab

272
00:11:59,608 --> 00:12:02,259
and pick up some even
cooler tools for us to use.

273
00:12:02,261 --> 00:12:04,161
- I didn't know you were coming again.
- Well, last week

274
00:12:04,163 --> 00:12:05,362
was a blast.

275
00:12:05,364 --> 00:12:08,582
Plus, I thought you might like
having a guy here.

276
00:12:10,869 --> 00:12:13,420
It was not funny.

277
00:12:14,205 --> 00:12:16,090
So, what tools did you bring?

278
00:12:16,092 --> 00:12:17,591
Everything we need
to make jewelry molds.

279
00:12:17,593 --> 00:12:19,360
Here's some silver,
a crucible

280
00:12:19,362 --> 00:12:21,378
and an acetylene torch
to melt it down.

281
00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:23,330
Ooh, that looks like fun.

282
00:12:23,332 --> 00:12:24,831
Maybe you should
master glue

283
00:12:24,833 --> 00:12:27,801
before you move
on to fire.

284
00:12:27,803 --> 00:12:29,219
Okay, who's up first?

285
00:12:29,221 --> 00:12:31,438
Rajesh, do you want to make
a bracelet for your mom

286
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:32,556
to go with the necklace?

287
00:12:32,558 --> 00:12:34,058
No, thanks.

288
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:35,693
I was gonna make
a necklace for my mom,

289
00:12:35,695 --> 00:12:38,112
but unfortunately,
she doesn't have a neck.

290
00:12:39,781 --> 00:12:43,016
She's just chins
and fat and feet.

291
00:12:47,489 --> 00:12:49,206
Okay, we're almost ready to go.

292
00:12:49,208 --> 00:12:51,542
Once we bond the wires,
we can test the tubes.

293
00:12:51,544 --> 00:12:54,828
This is so exciting,
I-I feel...

294
00:12:54,830 --> 00:12:57,581
like I'm 75 again.

295
00:13:01,019 --> 00:13:02,702
Oh, God.

296
00:13:02,704 --> 00:13:04,054
What... what is it?

297
00:13:04,056 --> 00:13:05,222
Sheldon just sent me a picture

298
00:13:05,224 --> 00:13:07,191
of him and Bill Nye
getting smoothies.

299
00:13:10,228 --> 00:13:12,379
Can-can I ask you
a question?

300
00:13:12,381 --> 00:13:13,480
Yeah, sure.

301
00:13:13,482 --> 00:13:16,166
W-Why do you put up
with Sheldon?

302
00:13:16,168 --> 00:13:20,070
Oh, uh, you know,
because we're friends.

303
00:13:21,489 --> 00:13:24,274
Why?

304
00:13:25,443 --> 00:13:27,277
Wow, you ask really
hard questions.

305
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:28,562
Yeah.

306
00:13:28,564 --> 00:13:31,115
Look, I-I know
he can be aggravating,

307
00:13:31,117 --> 00:13:32,699
but what you have
to remember is that

308
00:13:32,701 --> 00:13:34,168
he's not doing it
on purpose.

309
00:13:34,170 --> 00:13:35,536
It's just how he is.

310
00:13:35,538 --> 00:13:38,722
But he's also loyal
and trustworthy

311
00:13:38,724 --> 00:13:40,257
and we have fun together...

312
00:13:40,259 --> 00:13:43,794
You... you know
you're describing a dog.

313
00:13:45,263 --> 00:13:47,097
He did bite me once.

314
00:13:48,516 --> 00:13:49,967
But in his defense,

315
00:13:49,969 --> 00:13:52,302
I came up behind him
while he was eating, so...

316
00:13:52,304 --> 00:13:54,521
Yeah, they-they hate that.

317
00:13:56,775 --> 00:14:00,394
You know what, Sheldon is the
smartest person I have ever met.

318
00:14:00,396 --> 00:14:03,647
And he's a little broken
and he needs me.

319
00:14:04,949 --> 00:14:07,117
I guess I need him, too.

320
00:14:07,119 --> 00:14:08,702
Why-why is that?

321
00:14:08,704 --> 00:14:11,455
Boy, you will not
let this go, will you?

322
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:15,609
Oh, geez.

323
00:14:15,611 --> 00:14:17,327
Another photo from Sheldon?

324
00:14:17,329 --> 00:14:19,046
No, I have to go
pick him up.

325
00:14:19,048 --> 00:14:22,216
Bill Nye ditched him
at the smoothie place.

326
00:14:23,251 --> 00:14:26,286
He probably stole
his wallet, too.

327
00:14:30,175 --> 00:14:31,642
You know, if you guys
are interested,

328
00:14:31,644 --> 00:14:33,777
there's a technique where
I can take a lock of your hair,

329
00:14:33,779 --> 00:14:35,562
refine it into carbon dust,

330
00:14:35,564 --> 00:14:37,097
and use the hydraulic
press at work

331
00:14:37,099 --> 00:14:38,849
to turn it into
a tiny little diamond

332
00:14:38,851 --> 00:14:40,434
with your
DNA in it.

333
00:14:40,436 --> 00:14:42,136
Oh, that's amazing!

334
00:14:42,138 --> 00:14:43,654
Yeah. See Bernie's
engagement ring?

335
00:14:43,656 --> 00:14:46,156
That came right off
my mom's back.

336
00:14:46,158 --> 00:14:48,008
He's kidding.

337
00:14:48,010 --> 00:14:50,911
If that were true,
it'd be so much bigger.

338
00:14:53,181 --> 00:14:54,248
"My name is Howard.

339
00:14:54,250 --> 00:14:55,482
"I can make your hair
into diamonds.

340
00:14:55,484 --> 00:14:57,084
"My mom is morbidly obese.

341
00:14:57,086 --> 00:14:59,419
Everybody love me."

342
00:14:59,421 --> 00:15:02,222
Whoa, where is that coming from?

343
00:15:02,224 --> 00:15:03,624
I'll tell you
where it's coming from.

344
00:15:03,626 --> 00:15:06,260
All you do is make fun of me
for coming to girls' night

345
00:15:06,262 --> 00:15:08,045
and now you're here
ruining it for everyone.

346
00:15:08,047 --> 00:15:09,329
Raj, cool it...

347
00:15:09,331 --> 00:15:12,049
he's gonna make us
hair diamonds.

348
00:15:13,051 --> 00:15:14,384
How am I ruining anything?

349
00:15:14,386 --> 00:15:16,153
I'm just trying to help you
make better jewelry.

350
00:15:16,155 --> 00:15:18,305
But this isn't
about the jewelry.

351
00:15:18,307 --> 00:15:19,690
This is about me having a place

352
00:15:19,692 --> 00:15:21,725
where I can open up
about my feelings.

353
00:15:21,727 --> 00:15:25,062
Since when can't you
open up with me?

354
00:15:25,064 --> 00:15:26,613
There are just some things

355
00:15:26,615 --> 00:15:28,732
that I feel more comfortable
sharing with the girls,

356
00:15:28,734 --> 00:15:30,300
because they won't
make fun of me

357
00:15:30,302 --> 00:15:32,119
or and call me names,
or ask me if my

358
00:15:32,121 --> 00:15:34,571
"Koothrapanties are in a bunch."

359
00:15:37,041 --> 00:15:40,677
Buddy, I was just
joking around.

360
00:15:40,679 --> 00:15:42,579
Yeah, well, sometimes
your jokes hurt.

361
00:15:43,866 --> 00:15:45,215
Well, you're right.

362
00:15:45,217 --> 00:15:46,466
I didn't realize

363
00:15:46,468 --> 00:15:48,135
I was making you
feel that way.

364
00:15:49,504 --> 00:15:51,355
It was very brave
of you to tell me.

365
00:15:51,357 --> 00:15:53,307
Thank you.

366
00:15:53,309 --> 00:15:54,808
It wasn't easy.

367
00:15:57,078 --> 00:15:58,378
They're gonna
have sex

368
00:15:58,380 --> 00:16:01,081
before Sheldon and
I do, I know it.

369
00:16:05,570 --> 00:16:06,737
Arthur.

370
00:16:06,739 --> 00:16:08,054
Hi, Sheldon.

371
00:16:08,056 --> 00:16:09,907
I'm surprised
to see you here.

372
00:16:09,909 --> 00:16:11,658
Yeah, me, too.

373
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:13,744
Somewhere around
the third floor,

374
00:16:13,746 --> 00:16:17,230
I began to see
a white light.

375
00:16:19,450 --> 00:16:20,500
I'll get Leonard.

376
00:16:20,502 --> 00:16:22,219
No, no,
no, I'm...

377
00:16:22,221 --> 00:16:24,121
I'm here...
I'm here to see you.

378
00:16:24,123 --> 00:16:26,256
If you're hoping to get
in touch with Bill Nye,

379
00:16:26,258 --> 00:16:28,208
I can't help you.

380
00:16:28,210 --> 00:16:29,509
I've been informed
that he's now

381
00:16:29,511 --> 00:16:32,746
Bill Nye
the Restraining Order Guy.

382
00:16:33,932 --> 00:16:35,215
No, I'm...

383
00:16:35,217 --> 00:16:38,218
I-I was thinking,
if it isn't too much trouble,

384
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:41,471
I'd like to get your opinion
about my-my paper.

385
00:16:41,473 --> 00:16:43,440
Thank you.

386
00:16:43,442 --> 00:16:44,691
It would be an honor.

387
00:16:44,693 --> 00:16:46,476
Oh. Uh, great.

388
00:16:46,478 --> 00:16:48,145
Well, actually,
I don't need that.

389
00:16:48,147 --> 00:16:50,731
I hacked into your e-mail
account and read it.

390
00:16:51,699 --> 00:16:54,568
And... what did you think?

391
00:16:54,570 --> 00:16:57,120
Well, first,
I think the fact that

392
00:16:57,122 --> 00:16:59,323
you use your birthday
as a password

393
00:16:59,325 --> 00:17:01,742
is embarrassing.

394
00:17:01,744 --> 00:17:03,910
Mmm. Thank you.

395
00:17:05,296 --> 00:17:07,414
Second, um...

396
00:17:07,416 --> 00:17:09,967
I thought your
paper was inspired.

397
00:17:09,969 --> 00:17:13,453
Oh, well, that...
that means a lot to me.

398
00:17:13,455 --> 00:17:15,639
Can I invite you
in for tea?

399
00:17:15,641 --> 00:17:17,641
Uh, no, no.
I-I really...

400
00:17:17,643 --> 00:17:19,125
I have...
I have to run.

401
00:17:19,127 --> 00:17:20,477
Hey, Arthur.
How are you?

402
00:17:20,479 --> 00:17:22,629
Well, I guess one cup
wouldn't hurt.

403
00:17:30,304 --> 00:17:32,572
Oh, hey, buddy,
what's up?

404
00:17:32,574 --> 00:17:33,973
Well, I was
feeling bad

405
00:17:33,975 --> 00:17:35,676
about how I acted
the other night

406
00:17:35,678 --> 00:17:37,644
so I made you
a little something.

407
00:17:37,646 --> 00:17:39,363
You didn't have
to do that.

408
00:17:39,365 --> 00:17:40,330
Well, it was fun.

409
00:17:40,332 --> 00:17:41,665
I used some of
the jewelry techniques

410
00:17:41,667 --> 00:17:42,833
you taught us.

411
00:17:45,670 --> 00:17:48,588
It's a lightsaber
belt buckle.

412
00:17:48,590 --> 00:17:50,990
Wow, this
is so cool,

413
00:17:50,992 --> 00:17:53,677
Thanks.
Oh gets better.

414
00:17:56,348 --> 00:17:58,348
Wow!

415
00:17:58,350 --> 00:17:59,666
And that's not even
the best part.

416
00:17:59,668 --> 00:18:01,167
See?

417
00:18:01,169 --> 00:18:03,553
I have one, too.

418
00:18:05,106 --> 00:18:06,506
Check it out.

419
00:18:06,508 --> 00:18:08,809
You can wear yours
and we can have little sword fights

420
00:18:08,811 --> 00:18:10,677
whenever we want.

421
00:18:27,068 --> 00:18:30,537
Yeah, and my eighth favorite
episode of <i>Professor Proton</i>

422
00:18:30,539 --> 00:18:31,872
was "Alka-Seltzer Rocket."

423
00:18:31,874 --> 00:18:33,156
You said,
"Plop, plop,

424
00:18:33,158 --> 00:18:34,741
"fizz, fizz,

425
00:18:34,743 --> 00:18:37,044
oh, what a blast-off it is."

426
00:18:38,246 --> 00:18:39,296
Remember? Remember that?

427
00:18:39,298 --> 00:18:40,497
Remember?

428
00:18:41,883 --> 00:18:43,000
He can't help it.
He can't.

429
00:18:43,002 --> 00:18:44,334
He really can't.
Oh!

430
00:18:44,336 --> 00:18:45,719
Wait here.

431
00:18:45,721 --> 00:18:46,670
I'll get some Alka-Seltzer,

432
00:18:46,672 --> 00:18:47,838
we can build that rocket,

433
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:49,723
and we can shoot it
at Bill Nye's house.

434
00:18:51,059 --> 00:18:53,310
As long as I'm not within
500 feet of it.

435
00:18:58,466 --> 00:18:59,900
So, you, uh...

436
00:18:59,902 --> 00:19:02,569
you have...
you have any...

437
00:19:02,571 --> 00:19:04,655
single grandmothers?

438
00:19:06,674 --> 00:19:08,242
Sorry, they're both married.

439
00:19:08,244 --> 00:19:12,229
Good.
Mmm.

440
00:19:12,231 --> 00:19:14,364
H-Happily?

441
