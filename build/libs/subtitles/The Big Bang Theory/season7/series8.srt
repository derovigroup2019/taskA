1
00:00:02,075 --> 00:00:04,343
Hey, can I ask you a question?
Sure.

2
00:00:04,345 --> 00:00:05,411
You've had this dart board
since I've known you,

3
00:00:05,413 --> 00:00:06,829
but I've never seen you play.

4
00:00:06,831 --> 00:00:08,781
Oh, uh, we played... once.

5
00:00:08,783 --> 00:00:11,250
I broke a window.

6
00:00:11,252 --> 00:00:12,451
What window?

7
00:00:12,453 --> 00:00:14,369
That one over there.

8
00:00:15,371 --> 00:00:17,756
Leonard, where are
the Skee-Ball tickets?

9
00:00:17,758 --> 00:00:19,057
Skee-Ball tickets?

10
00:00:19,059 --> 00:00:21,210
Yeah, from when we went
to the arcade three years ago?

11
00:00:21,212 --> 00:00:23,545
I finally decided
what prize I want.

12
00:00:24,714 --> 00:00:26,682
Hurry up.

13
00:00:26,684 --> 00:00:29,301
Uh, if I still have them,

14
00:00:29,303 --> 00:00:31,386
they're probably
in the junk box.

15
00:00:31,388 --> 00:00:32,688
Ooh, what are you gonna get?

16
00:00:32,690 --> 00:00:33,856
None of your business.

17
00:00:33,858 --> 00:00:36,308
But when you see me
wearing a flower

18
00:00:36,310 --> 00:00:37,526
in my lapel later,

19
00:00:37,528 --> 00:00:39,862
you are most welcome
to sniff it.

20
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:42,981
Yup, oh... here you go.

21
00:00:42,983 --> 00:00:44,316
Oh, thank you.

22
00:00:44,318 --> 00:00:47,319
Here, get yourself an eraser
for your troubles.

23
00:00:47,321 --> 00:00:49,371
Oh.

24
00:00:49,373 --> 00:00:50,789
Oh-ho.

25
00:00:50,791 --> 00:00:51,957
I forgot about this.

26
00:00:51,959 --> 00:00:55,327
My aunt made it for me
when I started college.

27
00:00:58,047 --> 00:01:00,799
Aw, did she hate you?

28
00:01:00,801 --> 00:01:03,669
Why? Because I got an
ugly, itchy sweater,

29
00:01:03,671 --> 00:01:06,755
and my brother got a car?
No, I was her favorite.

30
00:01:07,623 --> 00:01:09,007
Yeah, I seem to be
a few tickets short.

31
00:01:09,009 --> 00:01:10,509
Are there more in the box?

32
00:01:10,511 --> 00:01:12,127
Hmm, I think I got them all.

33
00:01:12,129 --> 00:01:14,563
Nope, they're not in there.

34
00:01:14,565 --> 00:01:16,631
Well, you barely looked.
Let me see.

35
00:01:16,633 --> 00:01:18,300
No, no, no, I-I looked, and...

36
00:01:18,302 --> 00:01:20,452
No more tickets.

37
00:01:20,454 --> 00:01:21,653
Leonard, let me
look in the box.

38
00:01:21,655 --> 00:01:23,739
Okay, okay!

39
00:01:23,741 --> 00:01:25,140
I'm gonna show you
what's in the box.

40
00:01:25,142 --> 00:01:27,943
but just...
promise not to flip out.

41
00:01:27,945 --> 00:01:29,661
Why would I flip out?

42
00:01:29,663 --> 00:01:30,946
Is it a spider?

43
00:01:30,948 --> 00:01:33,365
It's a spider!

44
00:01:34,450 --> 00:01:36,018
No, if it was a spider,

45
00:01:36,020 --> 00:01:38,537
Lenny would've flipped out.

46
00:01:38,539 --> 00:01:39,621
Okay, Sheldon,

47
00:01:39,623 --> 00:01:41,006
I know I was supposed to return

48
00:01:41,008 --> 00:01:42,657
this DVD a long time ago,

49
00:01:42,659 --> 00:01:43,709
and I know we rented it

50
00:01:43,711 --> 00:01:44,826
on your card.

51
00:01:44,828 --> 00:01:46,795
But it's been, like, seven years

52
00:01:46,797 --> 00:01:47,930
and clearly nothing
bad has happened.

53
00:01:47,932 --> 00:01:50,265
So in-in-in-instead of being

54
00:01:50,267 --> 00:01:52,968
a giant pain in the ass
like you always are,

55
00:01:52,970 --> 00:01:54,019
what if

56
00:01:54,021 --> 00:01:57,389
this one time
you just tried staying calm?

57
00:02:02,011 --> 00:02:04,947
That seems
like a reasonable request.

58
00:02:06,533 --> 00:02:07,682
Although so did,
"Hey, Leonard, would you mind

59
00:02:07,684 --> 00:02:09,818
returning that DVD?"

60
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:13,539
I'm sorry.
I'll-Ill take care of it.

61
00:02:13,541 --> 00:02:16,041
Okay.

62
00:02:16,043 --> 00:02:18,076
I mean it, I'm going to.

63
00:02:19,212 --> 00:02:21,797
I believe you.

64
00:02:21,799 --> 00:02:25,083
And you're going to stay calm?

65
00:02:25,085 --> 00:02:27,419
I said I would.

66
00:02:31,257 --> 00:02:33,675
How about that?

67
00:02:34,694 --> 00:02:37,763
Sheldon's being reasonable.

68
00:02:37,765 --> 00:02:38,814
Yeah, it's freaking me out.

69
00:02:38,816 --> 00:02:40,098
I'm gonna go.

70
00:02:41,684 --> 00:02:45,320
? Our whole universe
was in a hot, dense state ?

71
00:02:45,322 --> 00:02:48,657
? Then nearly 14 billion years
ago expansion started... Wait! ?

72
00:02:48,659 --> 00:02:50,275
? The Earth began to cool

73
00:02:50,277 --> 00:02:52,811
? The autotrophs began to drool,
Neanderthals developed tools ?

74
00:02:52,813 --> 00:02:55,480
? We built the Wall
? <i>We built the pyramids</i> ?

75
00:02:55,482 --> 00:02:58,150
? Math, Science, History,
unraveling the mystery ?

76
00:02:58,152 --> 00:03:00,068
? That all started
with a big bang ?

77
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:01,898
? <i>Bang!</i> ?

78
00:03:01,899 --> 00:03:05,899

80
00:03:10,907 --> 00:03:13,692
So... when you say

81
00:03:13,694 --> 00:03:15,711
you're not going to freak
out about the DVD,

82
00:03:15,713 --> 00:03:19,314
here's what that means.

83
00:03:19,316 --> 00:03:20,615
Don't fixate on it.

84
00:03:20,617 --> 00:03:22,734
Don't wake me up
in the middle of the night.

85
00:03:22,736 --> 00:03:24,603
Or nag me through the door

86
00:03:24,605 --> 00:03:26,972
while I'm on the toilet.

87
00:03:26,974 --> 00:03:29,641
Okay, first, talking to you
while you're on the toilet

88
00:03:29,643 --> 00:03:32,644
isn't exactly a picnic
for me either, okay?

89
00:03:32,646 --> 00:03:33,878
Remember...

90
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:36,515
when you can hear me,
I can hear you.

91
00:03:36,517 --> 00:03:38,850
And second...

92
00:03:38,852 --> 00:03:40,218
you completely disregard

93
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:43,605
how uncomfortable
unresolved issues are for me.

94
00:03:43,607 --> 00:03:44,606
It's-it's like, a...

95
00:03:44,608 --> 00:03:47,159
an itch in my brain
I can't scratch.

96
00:03:47,161 --> 00:03:48,944
When I broke my arm I used

97
00:03:48,946 --> 00:03:51,747
to stick
a coat hanger down there.

98
00:03:52,782 --> 00:03:56,702
You ever try that?
Maybe go in through the ear?

99
00:03:56,704 --> 00:03:59,287
You wouldn't make jokes if you
could feel the way I feel.

100
00:03:59,289 --> 00:04:01,673
Well, I don't know
how to do that.

101
00:04:02,992 --> 00:04:04,793
How about this?

102
00:04:04,795 --> 00:04:07,629
I promise I won't pester you
about the DVD.

103
00:04:07,631 --> 00:04:10,766
You can defecate in peace.

104
00:04:10,768 --> 00:04:12,417
That's a win for both of us.

105
00:04:12,419 --> 00:04:13,852
But...

106
00:04:13,854 --> 00:04:16,338
until this matter is resolved,

107
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:17,889
I would like you

108
00:04:17,891 --> 00:04:21,059
to wear this sweater.

109
00:04:22,278 --> 00:04:25,714
With nothing underneath it.

110
00:04:25,716 --> 00:04:27,032
That's stupid.

111
00:04:27,034 --> 00:04:28,200
Why?

112
00:04:28,202 --> 00:04:30,368
You say it's itchy
and uncomfortable.

113
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:34,206
I say situations like this
make me feel the same way.

114
00:04:34,208 --> 00:04:36,992
I'm telling you, try the hanger.

115
00:04:36,994 --> 00:04:39,110
Put it on.

116
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:41,463
Let's share the experience.

117
00:04:42,548 --> 00:04:44,633
You got it.

118
00:04:44,635 --> 00:04:46,117
If this sweater
shuts you up,

119
00:04:46,119 --> 00:04:47,419
I'm gonna make a fortune

120
00:04:47,421 --> 00:04:49,504
selling them
to everyone we know.

121
00:04:50,389 --> 00:04:51,506
Now...

122
00:04:51,508 --> 00:04:52,791
all I need to do

123
00:04:52,793 --> 00:04:54,476
is head down to the video store

124
00:04:54,478 --> 00:04:57,512
and return the DVD.

125
00:05:01,067 --> 00:05:03,685
Oh, did I forget to tell you?

126
00:05:03,687 --> 00:05:07,405
That store went
out of business years ago.

127
00:05:09,358 --> 00:05:12,577
Really?

128
00:05:13,379 --> 00:05:15,263
How those nipples feeling,
chief?

129
00:05:18,401 --> 00:05:20,985
Penny, can we please
get our drinks?

130
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:22,337
Yeah, hang on, just give me sec.

131
00:05:22,339 --> 00:05:25,707
At work today, I did an
in vivo stereotaxic surgery.

132
00:05:25,709 --> 00:05:26,925
Cool. At my lab,

133
00:05:26,927 --> 00:05:29,795
I performed ten laser
capture micro-dissections.

134
00:05:29,797 --> 00:05:33,098
I scraped gum off the
bottom of that table.

135
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:36,167
Only 'cause my manager
saw me put it there.

136
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:38,002
Oh, my gosh.

137
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:40,105
That's the girl that
broke Rajesh's heart.

138
00:05:40,107 --> 00:05:41,439
That's Lucy?

139
00:05:41,441 --> 00:05:44,342
I don't know why but I always
pictured her as Indian.

140
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:46,144
I think that reason's
called racism.

141
00:05:46,146 --> 00:05:48,980
I'm gonna go talk to her.

142
00:05:48,982 --> 00:05:50,782
Why? What are you gonna say?

143
00:05:50,784 --> 00:05:51,950
I'm not gonna
say anything.

144
00:05:51,952 --> 00:05:53,235
I just want
to check her out.

145
00:05:53,237 --> 00:05:54,319
Because she hurt my friend.

146
00:05:54,321 --> 00:05:56,905
My Indian friend.

147
00:05:56,907 --> 00:05:58,456
Who's racist now?

148
00:05:58,458 --> 00:06:00,408
You because you just called him

149
00:06:00,410 --> 00:06:03,528
your "Indian friend."

150
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:06,131
Yeah, well, you're short.

151
00:06:08,434 --> 00:06:10,168
We're never getting
our drinks.

152
00:06:10,170 --> 00:06:13,171
No, but we knew that.

153
00:06:13,173 --> 00:06:15,473
Hey, can I start you off
with something to drink?

154
00:06:15,475 --> 00:06:16,875
Oh, water would be great.

155
00:06:16,877 --> 00:06:17,893
Okay.

156
00:06:17,895 --> 00:06:20,178
Um, you're Lucy, right?

157
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:21,880
I'm a friend
of Raj Koothrappali's.

158
00:06:21,882 --> 00:06:23,598
Actually Amy recognized you.

159
00:06:29,856 --> 00:06:31,907
Wow.

160
00:06:31,909 --> 00:06:33,408
How's he doing?

161
00:06:33,410 --> 00:06:34,860
Oh, you know, he's good.

162
00:06:34,862 --> 00:06:36,027
Great.

163
00:06:36,029 --> 00:06:38,079
Yeah, this is none
of my business.

164
00:06:38,081 --> 00:06:41,449
But why did you break up
with him in an e-mail?

165
00:06:41,451 --> 00:06:43,067
Oh, I don't know.

166
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:45,837
I guess I thought
it would be easier.

167
00:06:45,839 --> 00:06:47,539
Yeah, I get that.

168
00:06:47,541 --> 00:06:49,007
I'll go get you your water.

169
00:06:51,294 --> 00:06:54,346
When you say "easier,"

170
00:06:54,348 --> 00:06:56,014
you mean easier for you, right?

171
00:06:56,016 --> 00:06:58,266
'Cause it certainly didn't
make it easier for him.

172
00:06:58,268 --> 00:07:00,018
Any chance I can get

173
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:02,554
a different waitress?

174
00:07:02,556 --> 00:07:03,638
I-I'm sorry, this is rude of me.

175
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:04,856
I will go get that water.

176
00:07:06,425 --> 00:07:08,693
See, see, see, see.

177
00:07:08,695 --> 00:07:11,046
Just now you expressed
your feelings to my face.

178
00:07:11,048 --> 00:07:12,898
How come you could do that
with me, but not Raj?

179
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:15,450
I don't know your e-mail.

180
00:07:16,752 --> 00:07:17,869
You know what the worst part is?

181
00:07:17,871 --> 00:07:19,204
You're sitting here,
perfectly happy

182
00:07:19,206 --> 00:07:21,156
and he's at home,
a blubbering mess.

183
00:07:21,158 --> 00:07:22,741
Oh, I thought you said
he was okay.

184
00:07:22,743 --> 00:07:23,959
Well, I also said
I was getting you water,

185
00:07:23,961 --> 00:07:25,877
but look at me
still standing here.

186
00:07:27,663 --> 00:07:28,747
You know, I may be
a bad waitress,

187
00:07:28,749 --> 00:07:30,448
but you are a bad person.

188
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:33,919
Now, you want
to hear the specials?

189
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:41,074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

190
00:07:52,071 --> 00:07:55,190
So, you can never take it off?

191
00:07:55,192 --> 00:07:56,908
No.

192
00:07:56,910 --> 00:07:58,193
Not even to sleep?

193
00:07:58,195 --> 00:07:59,577
No.

194
00:07:59,579 --> 00:08:01,613
So, you're just an idiot?

195
00:08:01,615 --> 00:08:04,816
It's called proving a point.

196
00:08:04,818 --> 00:08:07,018
Is the point you're an idiot?

197
00:08:07,954 --> 00:08:09,621
Gentlemen, please.

198
00:08:09,623 --> 00:08:13,491
Leonard is trying to walk a mile
in my metaphorical shoes.

199
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:15,627
He can't walk
in my actual shoes.

200
00:08:15,629 --> 00:08:17,846
He has the feet of a toddler.

201
00:08:19,632 --> 00:08:21,499
So, how are you gonna
return the DVD

202
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:22,834
if the store went
out of business?

203
00:08:22,836 --> 00:08:24,953
Monday morning I'll go downtown

204
00:08:24,955 --> 00:08:27,188
look up the owner's information.

205
00:08:27,190 --> 00:08:31,026
And send him the DVD.

206
00:08:32,011 --> 00:08:34,446
Pay the late fee.

207
00:08:34,448 --> 00:08:36,247
And prove to Sheldon

208
00:08:36,249 --> 00:08:37,482
that you can have
a problem and solve it...

209
00:08:39,369 --> 00:08:42,020
...without acting
like a complete lunatic.

210
00:08:42,022 --> 00:08:44,305
Ah!

211
00:08:44,307 --> 00:08:46,992
And the man impersonating
a bear would like everyone

212
00:08:46,994 --> 00:08:50,245
to know that "Only you can
prevent forest fires."

213
00:08:52,197 --> 00:08:54,049
I don't get it.

214
00:08:54,051 --> 00:08:55,917
You didn't have
Smokey the Bear in India?

215
00:08:55,919 --> 00:08:59,337
No. Oh, is he anything
like, uh, Mun-Mun the Mongoose?

216
00:09:00,639 --> 00:09:03,591
He taught us not
to play with cobras.

217
00:09:03,593 --> 00:09:07,429
You had to be taught
not to play with cobras?

218
00:09:08,330 --> 00:09:09,597
You had to be taught

219
00:09:09,599 --> 00:09:11,766
not to burn down the forest?

220
00:09:21,027 --> 00:09:22,560
Hey, if you guys were hungry,
why didn't you order

221
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:23,912
something at the restaurant?

222
00:09:23,914 --> 00:09:25,947
We did, you never brought it.

223
00:09:27,366 --> 00:09:29,567
Oh, that's right.

224
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:31,619
Nachos and a turkey club.

225
00:09:31,621 --> 00:09:34,238
Not even close.

226
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,007
Well, I was too busy standing up

227
00:09:36,009 --> 00:09:38,710
for my friend to worry
about your...

228
00:09:38,712 --> 00:09:39,911
I want to say

229
00:09:39,913 --> 00:09:41,129
salmon.

230
00:09:41,131 --> 00:09:43,798
You want to say sorry.

231
00:09:47,887 --> 00:09:51,189
So, how are you gonna
tell Raj abut what you did?

232
00:09:51,191 --> 00:09:52,891
What do you mean "how"?
What's the big deal?

233
00:09:52,893 --> 00:09:54,976
You told Lucy
he was a pathetic mess.

234
00:09:54,978 --> 00:09:57,195
Then you made her cry and leave.

235
00:09:57,197 --> 00:09:59,030
Okay, you guys are overreacting.

236
00:09:59,032 --> 00:10:01,483
Raj is gonna appreciate
how I had his back.

237
00:10:01,485 --> 00:10:03,985
What is wrong
with you, Penny?!

238
00:10:03,987 --> 00:10:05,653
You ruined
any chance I had

239
00:10:05,655 --> 00:10:07,238
of getting back
with Lucy!

240
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:09,457
Now she knows
I'm a desperate mess

241
00:10:09,459 --> 00:10:11,960
instead of just
being pretty sure!

242
00:10:14,063 --> 00:10:15,613
It's Lucy.

243
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:17,499
She wants to meet
for coffee.

244
00:10:17,501 --> 00:10:19,717
I love you, Penny!

245
00:10:24,690 --> 00:10:26,558
Hey, what're you working on?

246
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:28,760
I'm thinking about

247
00:10:28,762 --> 00:10:30,562
how one could use the fact

248
00:10:30,564 --> 00:10:32,347
that a rapidly
rotating mirror

249
00:10:32,349 --> 00:10:34,566
turns virtual photons
into real ones

250
00:10:34,568 --> 00:10:37,569
as a method of
observing dark energy.

251
00:10:37,571 --> 00:10:39,237
That's a pretty cool idea.

252
00:10:39,239 --> 00:10:41,272
Yeah.
It's great you're here.

253
00:10:41,274 --> 00:10:42,891
I'd love to get
an engineer's opinion.

254
00:10:42,893 --> 00:10:44,159
Sure.

255
00:10:44,161 --> 00:10:46,661
This chair is squeaky.

256
00:10:49,331 --> 00:10:52,617
Now, do I fix it
or get a new one?

257
00:10:53,886 --> 00:10:56,437
Well, Sheldon,
it took me all morning,

258
00:10:56,439 --> 00:10:58,873
but I found the owner
of the video store.

259
00:10:58,875 --> 00:11:01,659
And I am happy to report that
he died peacefully in his sleep,

260
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:03,795
drunk at the bottom of a pool.

261
00:11:05,598 --> 00:11:08,049
Anyway, there is no one
to return the DVD to,

262
00:11:08,051 --> 00:11:11,803
so this issue is resolved.

263
00:11:11,805 --> 00:11:14,055
Ah...

264
00:11:15,007 --> 00:11:16,858
And I'd just like
to point out that

265
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:18,359
even though the sweater
was uncomfortable,

266
00:11:18,361 --> 00:11:19,861
I didn't use it as an excuse

267
00:11:19,863 --> 00:11:22,480
to antagonize
everyone around me.

268
00:11:22,482 --> 00:11:24,315
You know,
you could reimburse

269
00:11:24,317 --> 00:11:25,900
the video store owner's
next of kin.

270
00:11:25,902 --> 00:11:28,570
Or it's resolved!

271
00:11:30,322 --> 00:11:32,657
Hey, that next of kin thing
sounds pretty good.

272
00:11:34,026 --> 00:11:36,027
I believe
this is yours.

273
00:11:45,119 --> 00:11:47,337
Can I ask you guys
a question?

274
00:11:47,339 --> 00:11:49,289
So, I'm seeing Lucy
tomorrow night,

275
00:11:49,291 --> 00:11:51,090
and I've never hung out with
someone who broke up with me.

276
00:11:51,092 --> 00:11:52,375
How do you do it?

277
00:11:52,377 --> 00:11:53,860
You can't let her
know you're hurting.

278
00:11:53,862 --> 00:11:55,361
You know, the key
is confidence.

279
00:11:55,363 --> 00:11:57,797
Why is the key
always confidence?

280
00:11:57,799 --> 00:12:01,384
How come it's never
love handles and flop sweat?

281
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:04,804
If this girl hurt you so much,

282
00:12:04,806 --> 00:12:06,272
are you sure you want
to see her again?

283
00:12:06,274 --> 00:12:07,640
Well, if I may...

284
00:12:07,642 --> 00:12:09,192
he has so little
self-respect

285
00:12:09,194 --> 00:12:11,778
and is so desperate

286
00:12:11,780 --> 00:12:13,646
she could literally sleep
with his own father

287
00:12:13,648 --> 00:12:15,732
in his own bed
and post the video to YouTube,

288
00:12:15,734 --> 00:12:17,033
and he'd still
buy her flowers

289
00:12:17,035 --> 00:12:19,152
and ask her
to be his bride.

290
00:12:22,072 --> 00:12:23,456
He's right.

291
00:12:25,993 --> 00:12:27,961
But in my defense,
if we could survive that,

292
00:12:27,963 --> 00:12:30,046
we could survive anything.

293
00:12:31,715 --> 00:12:33,082
Well, if you're sure
you want to do this,

294
00:12:33,084 --> 00:12:33,967
it's only coffee...

295
00:12:33,969 --> 00:12:36,169
just relax
and see what happens.

296
00:12:36,171 --> 00:12:38,254
Well, can I say
she looks nice?

297
00:12:38,256 --> 00:12:39,088
Sure.

298
00:12:39,090 --> 00:12:40,723
Can I tell her I miss her?

299
00:12:40,725 --> 00:12:42,642
Maybe, if she asks.

300
00:12:42,644 --> 00:12:44,477
Oh, can I show her
an oil painting I made

301
00:12:44,479 --> 00:12:47,347
of us surrounded by our
children and grandchildren?

302
00:12:48,465 --> 00:12:51,267
I'd save that
for the second date.

303
00:12:52,202 --> 00:12:53,519
Good, good.

304
00:12:53,521 --> 00:12:55,137
'Cause no matter how hard I try,

305
00:12:55,139 --> 00:12:57,824
I cannot get the twins
to look alike.

306
00:13:03,247 --> 00:13:05,198
What are you doing?

307
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:08,084
Oh, I'm just trying to find
the stupid next of kin

308
00:13:08,086 --> 00:13:10,153
to this stupid video store owner

309
00:13:10,155 --> 00:13:11,854
so I can return the DVD

310
00:13:11,856 --> 00:13:14,424
and see the look
on Sheldon's stupid face

311
00:13:14,426 --> 00:13:16,459
when he sees that
I didn't let this get to me.

312
00:13:19,046 --> 00:13:20,096
Sheldon's not here.

313
00:13:20,098 --> 00:13:21,381
Why don't you take
the sweater off?

314
00:13:21,383 --> 00:13:23,165
Th-Th-There's a principle
at stake!

315
00:13:23,167 --> 00:13:24,634
Which is?
Oh, I don't know.

316
00:13:24,636 --> 00:13:26,936
Who cares? Look at me!

317
00:13:26,938 --> 00:13:28,471
Oh, my God!

318
00:13:28,473 --> 00:13:30,223
Is that sweater made of bees?

319
00:13:31,191 --> 00:13:33,192
Come on, take it off.
I won't tell.

320
00:13:33,194 --> 00:13:35,478
No, no, honey,
if I take it off, Sheldon wins.

321
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:36,696
Sweetie...

322
00:13:36,698 --> 00:13:38,698
every night you don't
kill him in his sleep,

323
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:40,616
he wins.

324
00:13:41,618 --> 00:13:43,703
Nah, i-it's... it's almost done.

325
00:13:43,705 --> 00:13:45,271
I just, I have to find...

326
00:13:45,273 --> 00:13:47,407
the next of kin,
and send 'em the DVD

327
00:13:47,409 --> 00:13:49,575
and then just wait for someone
with my complexion to die

328
00:13:49,577 --> 00:13:52,495
so I can get a skin graft.

329
00:13:52,497 --> 00:13:53,880
Smile.

330
00:13:53,882 --> 00:13:55,131
What-what is that?

331
00:13:55,133 --> 00:13:56,149
What is that for?

332
00:13:56,151 --> 00:13:57,667
So you can send it to Princeton

333
00:13:57,669 --> 00:13:59,419
and get your money back.

334
00:14:02,756 --> 00:14:04,724
must say, Sheldon,

335
00:14:04,726 --> 00:14:06,459
you're handling
this DVD business

336
00:14:06,461 --> 00:14:08,127
with an impressive
amount of maturity.

337
00:14:08,129 --> 00:14:10,630
I don't know why
that surprises you.

338
00:14:10,632 --> 00:14:11,664
I'm a grown man.

339
00:14:11,666 --> 00:14:14,033
As should be evident
by this sport coat

340
00:14:14,035 --> 00:14:17,670
and very real flower
in my lapel.

341
00:14:17,672 --> 00:14:21,024
Is there some kind of new coping
mechanism you're employing?

342
00:14:21,026 --> 00:14:24,327
The more interesting question
you should be asking is,

343
00:14:24,329 --> 00:14:27,280
"What does this
flower smell like?"

344
00:14:28,532 --> 00:14:30,183
I'm gonna go with sad.

345
00:14:31,118 --> 00:14:32,602
So what's the story

346
00:14:32,604 --> 00:14:34,037
with you and this DVD?

347
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:35,571
There's nothing to tell.

348
00:14:35,573 --> 00:14:37,573
Maybe I purchased
a book entitled,

349
00:14:37,575 --> 00:14:39,175
<i>Don't Sweat</i>
<i>the Small Stuff</i>

350
00:14:39,177 --> 00:14:41,911
and I followed
its wise suggestions,

351
00:14:41,913 --> 00:14:43,179
one of which was:

352
00:14:43,181 --> 00:14:45,348
stop and smell the flowers.

353
00:14:46,633 --> 00:14:48,101
Seriously?

354
00:14:48,103 --> 00:14:50,269
Please.

355
00:14:55,610 --> 00:14:57,610
Ha-ha!

356
00:14:57,612 --> 00:14:59,529
Oh.

357
00:15:06,103 --> 00:15:07,787
Hi.
Hello.

358
00:15:07,789 --> 00:15:09,772
Oh, it's so good
to see you.

359
00:15:09,774 --> 00:15:10,957
You, too.

360
00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:11,941
Please, sit.

361
00:15:11,943 --> 00:15:14,577
I, uh, I got you
a cappuccino.

362
00:15:14,579 --> 00:15:15,795
I remembered
it was your favorite.

363
00:15:15,797 --> 00:15:17,580
Oh.
I also got crumb cake,

364
00:15:17,582 --> 00:15:20,083
but I remembered it was
my favorite and I ate it.

365
00:15:21,718 --> 00:15:23,953
Anyway, uh,
how are you?

366
00:15:23,955 --> 00:15:25,755
I'm pretty good.

367
00:15:25,757 --> 00:15:28,257
Listen, I just wanted
to apologize

368
00:15:28,259 --> 00:15:30,593
for breaking up
with you in an e-mail.

369
00:15:30,595 --> 00:15:31,761
Well, and I ate all the
crumb cake.

370
00:15:31,763 --> 00:15:33,513
we both made
mistakes.

371
00:15:33,515 --> 00:15:35,464
Okay.

372
00:15:35,466 --> 00:15:37,517
I'm so happy
you asked me here,

373
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:39,352
and I hope we can
hang out again sometime.

374
00:15:39,354 --> 00:15:40,803
You know,
as friends,

375
00:15:40,805 --> 00:15:43,773
lovemaking partners,
whatever.

376
00:15:44,641 --> 00:15:46,826
Oh, uh...

377
00:15:46,828 --> 00:15:49,278
I'm kind of
seeing someone.

378
00:15:50,864 --> 00:15:52,782
I think I know
the answer to this,

379
00:15:52,784 --> 00:15:55,334
but just to be clear,
it's not me, right?

380
00:15:57,004 --> 00:15:58,921
This is all
your fault!

381
00:16:00,090 --> 00:16:01,323
I should've
listened to Mun-Mun

382
00:16:01,325 --> 00:16:02,842
because I've been
playing with a cobra

383
00:16:02,844 --> 00:16:04,544
and her name is Penny!

384
00:16:04,546 --> 00:16:06,429
Why are you so cruel?

385
00:16:06,431 --> 00:16:08,131
Do you enjoy my pain?

386
00:16:08,133 --> 00:16:10,266
There's a girl at the Cheesecake
Factory I can set you up with.

387
00:16:10,268 --> 00:16:12,468
I love you, Penny!

388
00:16:15,505 --> 00:16:18,474
How is it I can
conceptualize a methodology

389
00:16:18,476 --> 00:16:20,977
of examining dark matter
in the universe

390
00:16:20,979 --> 00:16:23,446
but can't figure out how
to fix a novelty squirt flower?

391
00:16:24,898 --> 00:16:26,349
I think the real
question is,

392
00:16:26,351 --> 00:16:29,735
why do you waste your time with cheap,
childish pranks?

393
00:16:29,737 --> 00:16:31,954
There's probably a deep reason.

394
00:16:31,956 --> 00:16:34,323
Which I'd be happy
to discuss with you

395
00:16:34,325 --> 00:16:36,542
over some peanut brittle
in a can.

396
00:16:37,928 --> 00:16:40,329
Okay, Sheldon,
I am out of options!

397
00:16:41,365 --> 00:16:43,299
Video store owner,
Nursis Manookian,

398
00:16:43,301 --> 00:16:44,867
has no next of kin!

399
00:16:44,869 --> 00:16:47,920
Well, you seem hot
under the collar...

400
00:16:47,922 --> 00:16:50,039
or is that the sweater?

401
00:16:50,041 --> 00:16:51,424
Oh, oh, no, no.

402
00:16:51,426 --> 00:16:53,509
I-It's because
I spent all afternoon

403
00:16:53,511 --> 00:16:55,878
at the Armenian church where
his funeral mass was held.

404
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:57,880
According to
Father Solakian,

405
00:16:57,882 --> 00:16:59,265
no one attended.

406
00:16:59,267 --> 00:17:01,234
Luckily, my trip
wasn't a complete waste.

407
00:17:01,236 --> 00:17:02,852
I lit a candle and
prayed for your death.

408
00:17:02,854 --> 00:17:05,521
But I'm not Armenian,
so it probably won't work!

409
00:17:06,823 --> 00:17:09,358
This is over, right?

410
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:11,277
Oh, not necessarily.

411
00:17:11,279 --> 00:17:13,029
I suggest

412
00:17:13,031 --> 00:17:14,997
you look for long-lost relatives

413
00:17:14,999 --> 00:17:18,367
either in Armenia or Lebanon.

414
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:21,921
Listen to me, Sheldon.

415
00:17:21,923 --> 00:17:24,006
I am not going to Lebanon

416
00:17:24,008 --> 00:17:27,910
to return <i>Super Mario Bros.</i>
the movie!

417
00:17:28,879 --> 00:17:31,430
You know, it might be fun.

418
00:17:31,432 --> 00:17:33,015
You love hummus.

419
00:17:34,751 --> 00:17:36,418
Why isn't this
bothering you?

420
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:38,804
I-Isn't your brain
getting itchy?

421
00:17:38,806 --> 00:17:41,224
This is
on your card.

422
00:17:41,226 --> 00:17:43,592
This could be ruining
your credit score!

423
00:17:43,594 --> 00:17:46,279
Why isn't this
making you crazy?

424
00:17:47,531 --> 00:17:51,150
Leonard...

425
00:17:51,152 --> 00:17:53,435
I have something
to tell you,

426
00:17:53,437 --> 00:17:56,438
but I want you to promise
not to flip out.

427
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:58,874
What?

428
00:17:58,876 --> 00:18:01,110
Seven years ago,

429
00:18:01,112 --> 00:18:03,079
I found out
the DVD was late

430
00:18:03,081 --> 00:18:04,413
and I paid for it.

431
00:18:12,506 --> 00:18:15,308
What?

432
00:18:15,310 --> 00:18:17,226
I was going to mention
it at the time,

433
00:18:17,228 --> 00:18:20,429
but then I thought,
some day,

434
00:18:20,431 --> 00:18:23,582
this might be
a teachable moment.

435
00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:38,781
Hah...

436
00:18:46,573 --> 00:18:48,207
I... You...

437
00:18:48,209 --> 00:18:49,625
How can...

438
00:18:49,627 --> 00:18:51,827
What?!

439
00:18:55,849 --> 00:18:57,717
Sheldon...

440
00:18:57,719 --> 00:19:00,303
that was diabolical.

441
00:19:00,305 --> 00:19:01,637
I know.

442
00:19:02,873 --> 00:19:04,357
And it wasn't easy.

443
00:19:04,359 --> 00:19:06,108
Do you have any idea
what it's like

444
00:19:06,110 --> 00:19:08,344
to wait for years and never know

445
00:19:08,346 --> 00:19:11,314
if you're going to finally
get satisfaction?

446
00:19:21,402 --> 00:19:22,852
Wow.

447
00:19:22,854 --> 00:19:24,720
You're even prettier
than Penny said.

448
00:19:24,722 --> 00:19:25,989
I can't believe

449
00:19:25,991 --> 00:19:27,574
a girl like you
doesn't have a boyfriend.

450
00:19:27,576 --> 00:19:28,825
Well, I don't.

451
00:19:28,827 --> 00:19:31,010
I don't believe you,
you're lying to me!

452
00:19:31,895 --> 00:19:33,062
What?

453
00:19:33,064 --> 00:19:34,364
Oh, it's okay.

454
00:19:34,366 --> 00:19:36,082
I have no morals and
I'm desperately lonely.

455
00:19:36,084 --> 00:19:37,283
I'll be the other man

456
00:19:37,285 --> 00:19:40,119
if you want a little
something-something on the side.

457
00:19:40,121 --> 00:19:42,005
What is wrong
with you?!

458
00:19:42,007 --> 00:19:43,673
What is wrong with you?!

459
00:19:43,675 --> 00:19:45,341
What is wrong with you?!
