1
00:00:02,117 --> 00:00:04,285
Advantage left-side competitor.

2
00:00:06,872 --> 00:00:08,406
Wow, you're really
good at this.

3
00:00:08,408 --> 00:00:11,576
Well, I have an extremely
low center of gravity.

4
00:00:11,578 --> 00:00:14,796
I'm like a pyramid.

5
00:00:17,249 --> 00:00:18,499
How you doing over there?

6
00:00:18,501 --> 00:00:22,003
Oh, I hope it's just a sprain.

7
00:00:22,671 --> 00:00:24,255
I cannot walk into that E.R.

8
00:00:24,257 --> 00:00:27,441
with another video game injury.

9
00:00:27,443 --> 00:00:29,760
Hey, Sheldon,
you want to play next?

10
00:00:29,762 --> 00:00:32,146
Oh, I would, but
I'm on my way out.

11
00:00:32,148 --> 00:00:35,382
Where?
Texas.

12
00:00:35,384 --> 00:00:37,351
Right now?

13
00:00:37,353 --> 00:00:38,436
Why?

14
00:00:38,438 --> 00:00:39,921
Is someone sick?
Yes.

15
00:00:39,923 --> 00:00:43,524
My sister's uterus came
down with a baby.

16
00:00:44,626 --> 00:00:46,360
Oh, she's pregnant?
That's great.

17
00:00:46,362 --> 00:00:48,329
You're gone an uncle--
Uncle Sheldon.

18
00:00:48,331 --> 00:00:51,065
No, I will be
Uncle Dr. Cooper.

19
00:00:51,950 --> 00:00:54,035
How come you never said
she was pregnant?

20
00:00:54,037 --> 00:00:56,037
Well, I never told you
about my brother's kidney stone.

21
00:00:56,039 --> 00:00:57,288
You want to hear
about everything

22
00:00:57,290 --> 00:00:59,373
that comes out
of my family's genitals?

23
00:01:00,342 --> 00:01:01,909
Well, congrats, and it's nice

24
00:01:01,911 --> 00:01:03,340
you're gonna be there
for your sister.

25
00:01:03,341 --> 00:01:04,070
Yes.

26
00:01:04,130 --> 00:01:06,080
I'm filling in for her husband
who's recovering

27
00:01:06,082 --> 00:01:08,382
from a horrible
motorcycle accident.

28
00:01:08,384 --> 00:01:10,601
Lucky duck.

29
00:01:10,603 --> 00:01:13,420
Wow, so, how long
will you be gone?

30
00:01:13,422 --> 00:01:15,223
Well, she's due tomorrow.

31
00:01:15,225 --> 00:01:17,308
Although it did take her six
years to finish high school,

32
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:18,759
so who knows?

33
00:01:18,761 --> 00:01:20,978
Can I give you a ride
to the airport?

34
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:23,597
Oh, no, thank you, I don't want
to be an inconvenience.

35
00:01:23,599 --> 00:01:24,899
Chop-chop, Leonard.

36
00:01:24,901 --> 00:01:26,901
We leave in ten minutes.

37
00:01:28,603 --> 00:01:32,240
? Our whole universe
was in a hot, dense state ?

38
00:01:32,242 --> 00:01:35,576
? Then nearly 14 billion years
ago expansion started... Wait! ?

39
00:01:35,578 --> 00:01:37,195
? The Earth began to cool

40
00:01:37,197 --> 00:01:39,747
? The autotrophs began to drool,
Neanderthals developed tools ?

41
00:01:39,749 --> 00:01:42,416
? We built the Wall
? <i>We built the pyramids</i> ?

42
00:01:42,418 --> 00:01:45,069
? Math, Science, History,
unveiling the mystery ?

43
00:01:45,071 --> 00:01:46,971
? That all started
with a big bang ?

44
00:01:46,973 --> 00:01:48,554
? <i>Bang!</i> ?

45
00:01:48,555 --> 00:01:52,555

00:01:57,607 --> 00:01:59,658
All right, here's the deal.

48
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:01,877
Sheldon is gone,
so the tree decorating rules

49
00:02:01,879 --> 00:02:02,911
are out the window.

50
00:02:02,913 --> 00:02:03,929
Yeah, which means

51
00:02:03,931 --> 00:02:05,431
we don't have to use
his ridiculous

52
00:02:05,433 --> 00:02:08,333
ornament-spacing template.

53
00:02:08,335 --> 00:02:10,519
And I'm happy to report
its kickstarter campaign

54
00:02:10,521 --> 00:02:13,388
is holding strong at zero dollars.
Ah.

55
00:02:13,390 --> 00:02:16,308
Wait, so <i>Star Wars</i>
and <i>Star Trek</i> characters

56
00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:18,593
can go on the same branch?

57
00:02:18,595 --> 00:02:19,895
I know, it's crazy.

58
00:02:19,897 --> 00:02:21,930
Welcome to the Thunderdome,
people!

59
00:02:23,734 --> 00:02:25,100
I've never done this before.

60
00:02:25,102 --> 00:02:26,401
It's kind of fun.

61
00:02:26,403 --> 00:02:27,435
Yeah, if your mom could see

62
00:02:27,437 --> 00:02:28,754
her little Bar Mitzvah boy
right now,

63
00:02:28,756 --> 00:02:29,872
she'd have a heart attack.

64
00:02:29,874 --> 00:02:32,374
Good idea, I'll take a picture.

65
00:02:36,445 --> 00:02:38,330
Honey, I'm a little strapped
for cash this year,

66
00:02:38,332 --> 00:02:41,633
so for Christmas I was
thinking of giving you...

67
00:02:41,635 --> 00:02:44,503
this.

68
00:02:44,505 --> 00:02:45,838
I love it.

69
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,172
Okay.

70
00:02:47,174 --> 00:02:49,141
But it is what you got me
last year.

71
00:02:49,143 --> 00:02:51,176
Yeah.
And last night.

72
00:02:53,264 --> 00:02:54,813
Hello.

73
00:02:54,815 --> 00:02:56,181
Hi, Stuart.

74
00:02:56,183 --> 00:02:57,232
Oh, good, I'm glad you guys

75
00:02:57,234 --> 00:02:58,567
didn't wait for me to start.

76
00:02:58,569 --> 00:02:59,801
Although you said 7:00

77
00:02:59,803 --> 00:03:02,688
and it's-it's 7:00,
but that's fine.

78
00:03:04,992 --> 00:03:08,443
Oh, it's probably Sheldon.

79
00:03:08,445 --> 00:03:09,561
Hi, Sheldon.

80
00:03:09,563 --> 00:03:11,830
Everybody's here, say hi.

81
00:03:11,832 --> 00:03:12,981
Hey. - Hey.
Hey, buddy.

82
00:03:12,983 --> 00:03:14,482
Howdy.
Hi.

83
00:03:14,484 --> 00:03:16,251
Hello.

84
00:03:18,171 --> 00:03:19,338
The second I go out of town

85
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:21,656
you throw a Christmas party
without me?

86
00:03:21,658 --> 00:03:23,292
Yeah, kind of.

87
00:03:23,294 --> 00:03:24,960
That's so thoughtful.

88
00:03:24,962 --> 00:03:26,795
You guys are the best.

89
00:03:26,797 --> 00:03:29,515
Hey, how's your sister?

90
00:03:29,517 --> 00:03:32,050
She went into labor an hour ago.

91
00:03:32,052 --> 00:03:34,502
That's wonderful.
So you're at the hospital?

92
00:03:34,504 --> 00:03:37,272
No, she chose to have a home
birth... because she wants

93
00:03:37,274 --> 00:03:41,176
to live in the Stone Age
and a cave wasn't available.

94
00:03:41,178 --> 00:03:44,363
You know, many
people believe

95
00:03:44,365 --> 00:03:46,365
that home births are
better because the mother

96
00:03:46,367 --> 00:03:47,866
is in a warm,
comfortable environment

97
00:03:47,868 --> 00:03:49,952
where she can be nurtured
by loved ones.

98
00:03:49,954 --> 00:03:51,703
And turn the bedroom floor

99
00:03:51,705 --> 00:03:54,689
into an amniotic Slip 'n Slide.

100
00:03:55,491 --> 00:03:57,409
Shelly, come on!

101
00:03:57,411 --> 00:03:59,711
Your sister's fully dilated

102
00:03:59,713 --> 00:04:01,997
and she wants
a nice family picture

103
00:04:01,999 --> 00:04:05,083
before there's blood everywhere!

104
00:04:05,085 --> 00:04:06,701
Oh, boy.

105
00:04:06,703 --> 00:04:10,372
I picked the wrong day
to wear my good robot T-shirt.

106
00:04:12,592 --> 00:04:14,343
If you were having
Sheldon's baby

107
00:04:14,345 --> 00:04:16,311
would you really want
him in the room?

108
00:04:16,313 --> 00:04:18,213
Yeah, if he's in the room
when they're making the baby,

109
00:04:18,215 --> 00:04:20,766
I'll give you ten dollars.

110
00:04:21,734 --> 00:04:23,101
Hey, I brought over
<i>It's a Wonderful Life</i>

111
00:04:23,103 --> 00:04:24,820
if you guys want
to watch it later.

112
00:04:24,822 --> 00:04:26,054
Oh, I love that movie.

113
00:04:26,056 --> 00:04:27,022
I've never seen it.

114
00:04:27,024 --> 00:04:28,924
- Me neither.
- It's great.

115
00:04:28,926 --> 00:04:31,777
It's Christmastime and
Jimmy Stewart's really depressed

116
00:04:31,779 --> 00:04:34,329
and he's gonna jump off a bridge
and kill himself...

117
00:04:34,331 --> 00:04:36,548
Don't need to see it.
Living it.

118
00:04:37,533 --> 00:04:38,667
But then he gets to see
what the world

119
00:04:38,669 --> 00:04:41,069
would be like
if he'd never been born.

120
00:04:41,071 --> 00:04:42,454
Hey, you ever imagine
what that would be like?

121
00:04:42,456 --> 00:04:43,839
Not being born?

122
00:04:43,841 --> 00:04:45,573
What do you think?

123
00:04:45,575 --> 00:04:47,009
What do you think?

124
00:04:47,011 --> 00:04:49,177
What do you think?

125
00:04:51,047 --> 00:04:53,015
You make jokes about Sheldon,

126
00:04:53,017 --> 00:04:54,349
but if it weren't
for him,

127
00:04:54,351 --> 00:04:55,701
I don't think
any of us

128
00:04:55,703 --> 00:04:57,636
would be sitting
in this room right now.

129
00:04:57,638 --> 00:04:59,221
Really? Sheldon not being here

130
00:04:59,223 --> 00:05:02,057
is the main reason
I'm in this room.

131
00:05:03,626 --> 00:05:04,926
It's true.

132
00:05:04,928 --> 00:05:06,645
None of you would know me.

133
00:05:06,647 --> 00:05:08,397
You wouldn't
know Bernadette.

134
00:05:08,399 --> 00:05:10,816
You wouldn't be dating Penny.
You don't know that.

135
00:05:10,818 --> 00:05:12,618
I've been going to the
Cheesecake Factory for years.

136
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:13,735
I could have picked her up.

137
00:05:17,574 --> 00:05:20,442
Oh, you weren't joking.

138
00:05:20,444 --> 00:05:21,376
No.

139
00:05:21,378 --> 00:05:22,911
Okay, sweetie,
let me tell you

140
00:05:22,913 --> 00:05:24,997
exactly how that
would have gone down.

141
00:05:27,834 --> 00:05:29,668
I'm gonna do it.
I'm gonna ask her out.

142
00:05:29,670 --> 00:05:34,172
I'm gonna squirt chocolate milk
out of my nipples.

143
00:05:34,174 --> 00:05:36,291
Sorry, I thought
we're saying things

144
00:05:36,293 --> 00:05:38,010
that are never
gonna happen.

145
00:05:38,012 --> 00:05:40,395
Maybe this time
he's going to do it.

146
00:05:40,397 --> 00:05:42,347
Hope you're thirsty,
here it comes.

147
00:05:45,018 --> 00:05:46,401
Watch me.

148
00:05:46,403 --> 00:05:49,771
Hey, you guys ready to order
or you need a few minutes?

149
00:05:49,773 --> 00:05:51,056
I, uh, ah, um, I...

150
00:05:51,058 --> 00:05:52,607
A few minutes it is.

151
00:05:53,976 --> 00:05:56,912
You didn't ask her out,
but that was a lot of sounds.

152
00:05:58,614 --> 00:06:00,365
You guys are
making me nervous.

153
00:06:00,367 --> 00:06:02,084
Fine, then go talk
to her on your own.

154
00:06:02,086 --> 00:06:04,119
I will.

155
00:06:11,177 --> 00:06:12,377
Excuse me.

156
00:06:12,379 --> 00:06:13,628
Yeah?

157
00:06:13,630 --> 00:06:16,831
Hi, uh, um, I'm Leonard?

158
00:06:16,833 --> 00:06:19,834
Really? You don't
sound so sure.

159
00:06:19,836 --> 00:06:22,804
No, I am he.

160
00:06:25,191 --> 00:06:27,175
Uh, any-anyway, um,

161
00:06:27,177 --> 00:06:29,311
there's been something
I've wanted to ask you

162
00:06:29,313 --> 00:06:31,446
for a long time. Um...

163
00:06:31,448 --> 00:06:33,281
What's that?
Eh, uh, well,

164
00:06:33,283 --> 00:06:35,683
I was wondering--
if you're not too busy--

165
00:06:35,685 --> 00:06:37,102
um, uh, if,

166
00:06:37,104 --> 00:06:39,788
if you'd be interested in...

167
00:06:40,573 --> 00:06:44,076
...telling me where
the restroom is?

168
00:06:47,630 --> 00:06:49,247
I think you're too late.

169
00:06:49,249 --> 00:06:53,969
Come on, I would not
have peed my pants.

170
00:06:53,971 --> 00:06:55,870
She nailed it.
Sounds about right.

171
00:06:56,889 --> 00:06:59,508
But, you forget, I did
ask you out in real life.

172
00:06:59,510 --> 00:07:01,977
Which couldn't have happened if
you didn't live across the hall

173
00:07:01,979 --> 00:07:04,312
from her, which couldn't have
happened without Sheldon.

174
00:07:04,314 --> 00:07:05,814
Same goes
with you guys.

175
00:07:05,816 --> 00:07:07,182
If Leonard wasn't with Penny,

176
00:07:07,184 --> 00:07:08,683
she never would
have set you up.

177
00:07:08,685 --> 00:07:10,552
Doesn't matter. Bernadette
still would've been working

178
00:07:10,554 --> 00:07:11,853
at The Cheesecake Factory,

179
00:07:11,855 --> 00:07:14,889
and I still would've been
working this beefcake factory.

180
00:07:16,526 --> 00:07:18,994
You would've been all over me.

181
00:07:18,996 --> 00:07:20,695
Well...

182
00:07:23,116 --> 00:07:25,000
Hey, Penny, can
I take that table?

183
00:07:25,002 --> 00:07:26,118
Sure, why?

184
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:28,253
The one in the turtleneck
is cute.

185
00:07:28,255 --> 00:07:29,737
Open wide,

186
00:07:29,739 --> 00:07:32,290
here comes the happy train.

187
00:07:33,843 --> 00:07:37,579
Mm-hmm, chug-a
chug-a, yum, yum.

188
00:07:38,914 --> 00:07:40,966
Oh.

189
00:07:40,968 --> 00:07:42,750
Hang on.

190
00:07:43,686 --> 00:07:46,188
You got a... you got
a little something.

191
00:07:49,475 --> 00:07:51,092
Never mind.

192
00:07:52,779 --> 00:07:54,646
Oh, man,

193
00:07:54,648 --> 00:07:57,098
that is so us.

194
00:08:01,154 --> 00:08:03,121
You know, maybe you and
I wouldn't be together,

195
00:08:03,123 --> 00:08:04,939
but you wouldn't have
done so great yourself.

196
00:08:04,941 --> 00:08:06,441
Why?
Because I know exactly

197
00:08:06,443 --> 00:08:08,610
the kind of guy you
would've ended up with.

198
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:13,381
Hey, babe.

199
00:08:13,383 --> 00:08:15,050
Hey. Did you remember
to pay the rent?

200
00:08:15,052 --> 00:08:17,836
Better. I used the money
to buy these magic beans.

201
00:08:19,005 --> 00:08:21,089
Hey, he may be
an idiot, but at least

202
00:08:21,091 --> 00:08:22,841
he didn't pee himself.

203
00:08:24,627 --> 00:08:26,845
Oh, hold on.

204
00:08:27,814 --> 00:08:29,797
Aw, babe, I peed myself.

205
00:08:31,567 --> 00:08:33,819
Me, too.

206
00:08:40,076 --> 00:08:43,445
The end.

207
00:08:47,450 --> 00:08:48,867
Hi, Sheldon.

208
00:08:48,869 --> 00:08:50,151
Everything okay?

209
00:08:50,153 --> 00:08:52,871
No, it's not.

210
00:08:52,873 --> 00:08:54,708
I've seen things.

211
00:08:55,889 --> 00:09:00,161
Lady things.

212
00:09:00,162 --> 00:09:01,829
Listen to me.

213
00:09:01,831 --> 00:09:04,666
That is not the way
they usually look.

214
00:09:07,487 --> 00:09:09,104
Doesn't matter.

215
00:09:09,106 --> 00:09:11,773
This is no way
to make new humans.

216
00:09:11,775 --> 00:09:14,059
People coming out of people.

217
00:09:15,561 --> 00:09:17,896
It's some kind
of dirty magic show.

218
00:09:17,898 --> 00:09:20,565
Sheldon Lee Cooper.

219
00:09:20,567 --> 00:09:23,401
You get back
in this room right now.

220
00:09:23,403 --> 00:09:25,687
Bring a mop.

221
00:09:25,689 --> 00:09:27,021
Did you hear that?

222
00:09:27,023 --> 00:09:28,690
A mop.

223
00:09:28,692 --> 00:09:31,159
I have two PhDs yet somehow
I'm the janitor

224
00:09:31,161 --> 00:09:33,128
of my sister's birth canal.

225
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:41,074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

226
00:09:42,674 --> 00:09:44,759
Hey, Sheldon sent us all

227
00:09:44,761 --> 00:09:45,959
an e-mail.

228
00:09:45,961 --> 00:09:47,895
"Happy holidays from Texas."
Aw.

229
00:09:47,897 --> 00:09:49,096
And there's pictures.

230
00:09:49,098 --> 00:09:50,164
Aah!

231
00:09:50,166 --> 00:09:52,233
Don't open them.
Do <i>not</i> open them.

232
00:09:52,235 --> 00:09:54,185
Oh, come on.

233
00:09:54,187 --> 00:09:56,153
Childbirth is a
natural, beautiful...

234
00:09:56,155 --> 00:09:59,190
Oh, it's like someone
sawed a cow in half.

235
00:10:02,077 --> 00:10:05,863
My father's a gynecologist,
I think I can handle it.

236
00:10:06,498 --> 00:10:09,050
And, now, I'm gay.

237
00:10:11,370 --> 00:10:13,153
You know, I was thinking.
Without Sheldon,

238
00:10:13,155 --> 00:10:14,505
most of us would have never met,

239
00:10:14,507 --> 00:10:16,590
but Penny would still
live across from him.

240
00:10:16,592 --> 00:10:19,493
And with Leonard
out of the picture,

241
00:10:19,495 --> 00:10:21,095
we all know what
that would mean.

242
00:10:21,097 --> 00:10:22,730
We do?

243
00:10:25,984 --> 00:10:27,601
Hey, Sheldon.

244
00:10:27,603 --> 00:10:29,770
Hello.

245
00:10:30,672 --> 00:10:32,807
Doing laundry?

246
00:10:36,812 --> 00:10:38,979
Of course
I'm doing laundry.

247
00:10:38,981 --> 00:10:40,698
Saturday night is laundry night,

248
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:43,183
and I'm in a laundry room, so...

249
00:10:43,185 --> 00:10:45,069
I believe your inference
is justified.

250
00:10:45,071 --> 00:10:47,621
Oh, my
inference is justified.

251
00:10:47,623 --> 00:10:50,157
Sheldon, you
are so funny.

252
00:10:52,911 --> 00:10:55,463
Anyway, I need to
do my laundry, too,

253
00:10:55,465 --> 00:10:58,866
because these
clothes are so dirty.

254
00:10:58,868 --> 00:11:02,670
Almost as dirty as the dirty
girl who's wearing them.

255
00:11:05,206 --> 00:11:06,140
Okay, that's enough.

256
00:11:06,142 --> 00:11:08,693
Disagree.
Keep going. - More.

257
00:11:10,379 --> 00:11:13,180
So, what do you think?

258
00:11:13,182 --> 00:11:18,319
A tad asymmetrical, but nothing
to be concerned about.

259
00:11:19,654 --> 00:11:21,689
Please, Sheldon. I need you.

260
00:11:21,691 --> 00:11:25,059
To... what?

261
00:11:25,061 --> 00:11:27,161
To take me.

262
00:11:27,163 --> 00:11:30,698
I'm not taking you anywhere
till you put on a shirt.

263
00:11:31,867 --> 00:11:35,235
Come on, Sheldon.
You and me right here.

264
00:11:35,237 --> 00:11:37,922
Penny, for the thousandth time,

265
00:11:37,924 --> 00:11:41,074
I'm saving myself
for someone special.

266
00:11:41,076 --> 00:11:44,044
Perhaps a cute
bespectacled neuroscientist

267
00:11:44,046 --> 00:11:48,549
with hair
the color of mud.

268
00:11:48,551 --> 00:11:51,185
I think I know how
to change your mind.

269
00:11:52,754 --> 00:11:54,305
That's enough.
Ew...

270
00:11:55,190 --> 00:11:57,558
I was okay with it.

271
00:12:01,864 --> 00:12:04,064
How's it going, Sheldon?

272
00:12:04,066 --> 00:12:05,483
Actually, much better.

273
00:12:05,485 --> 00:12:06,984
Oh, good.
Is the baby born yet?

274
00:12:06,986 --> 00:12:09,136
I don't know. I just got back.

275
00:12:09,138 --> 00:12:10,204
Where'd you go?

276
00:12:10,206 --> 00:12:13,207
My mother asked me
to get some towels.

277
00:12:13,209 --> 00:12:15,442
I took advantage
of the vague request

278
00:12:15,444 --> 00:12:18,012
and went to Bed,
Bath & Beyond.

279
00:12:20,950 --> 00:12:23,951
Excuse me! I'm on the phone!

280
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:28,355
So rude.

281
00:12:29,457 --> 00:12:31,709
Here's another one.
Penny,

282
00:12:31,711 --> 00:12:33,093
if it weren't for Sheldon,

283
00:12:33,095 --> 00:12:37,681
you never would have met
comic book legend Stan Lee.

284
00:12:38,817 --> 00:12:41,068
Great.

285
00:12:42,020 --> 00:12:43,137
At least Leonard,

286
00:12:43,139 --> 00:12:46,173
Howard and I would have
always been friends.

287
00:12:46,175 --> 00:12:48,909
Hey, how come you three never
got an apartment together?

288
00:12:48,911 --> 00:12:51,144
We talked about it,
but Howard was in

289
00:12:51,146 --> 00:12:54,331
a pretty serious
relationship with his mom.

290
00:12:54,333 --> 00:12:57,001
I lived with her to save money.

291
00:12:57,003 --> 00:12:58,385
Yeah, you didn't have
to buy groceries

292
00:12:58,387 --> 00:12:59,420
'cause you were breast-feeding.

293
00:13:00,456 --> 00:13:03,757
Aw, so I guess
if it weren't for me,

294
00:13:03,759 --> 00:13:05,509
you'd still be living
with her, huh?

295
00:13:05,511 --> 00:13:07,511
Not exactly.

296
00:13:07,513 --> 00:13:08,762
What do you mean, "not exactly"?

297
00:13:08,764 --> 00:13:11,999
Well, things would be
a little different.

298
00:13:12,001 --> 00:13:15,002
Howard, where's my lunch?!

299
00:13:15,004 --> 00:13:18,138
I'm starving!

300
00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:19,607
I know you're starving.

301
00:13:19,609 --> 00:13:21,392
The neighbors know
you're starving.

302
00:13:21,394 --> 00:13:24,678
There's starving people in
Africa who know you're starving!

303
00:13:26,565 --> 00:13:29,250
That's it?!
There's not enough food!

304
00:13:29,252 --> 00:13:33,554
Well, you cleaned out Earth!
I don't know what else to do!

305
00:13:34,139 --> 00:13:36,807
How is this
any different?

306
00:13:36,809 --> 00:13:39,293
You didn't let me finish.

307
00:13:39,295 --> 00:13:41,795
Here you go, Mother.

308
00:13:41,797 --> 00:13:44,298
You're a good boy, Howard!

309
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:48,085
Such a good boy!

310
00:13:52,874 --> 00:13:55,242
Wait-- did she die
or did you kill her?

311
00:13:57,379 --> 00:14:01,015
Eh, tomato, tomahto. The
important thing is she's dead.

312
00:14:02,684 --> 00:14:05,769
Hey, so how come you two
didn't move in together?

313
00:14:05,771 --> 00:14:07,521
This guy wanted
a place of his own

314
00:14:07,523 --> 00:14:09,823
because he was sure he was
gonna be a ladies' man.

315
00:14:11,726 --> 00:14:13,444
Yeah, I was wrong.

316
00:14:14,529 --> 00:14:17,364
But I do think you and I
would have had a great time.

317
00:14:17,366 --> 00:14:20,251
Come on, Leonard, dinner.

318
00:14:20,253 --> 00:14:22,186
Coming.

319
00:14:30,962 --> 00:14:32,162
<i>Hang on.</i>

320
00:14:32,164 --> 00:14:33,847
Why would I be fat?

321
00:14:34,933 --> 00:14:37,301
You'd have no girlfriend
to see you naked,

322
00:14:37,303 --> 00:14:40,054
you'd try to fill the void
with food,

323
00:14:40,056 --> 00:14:43,256
and I'm an enabler who once
deep-fried a pancake.

324
00:14:43,858 --> 00:14:45,976
Why can't you be fat, too?

325
00:14:47,562 --> 00:14:50,281
What do you want
to do for dessert?

326
00:14:52,317 --> 00:14:55,419
I think there's still
half a cake from breakfast.

327
00:14:57,205 --> 00:14:59,373
No, there's not.

328
00:15:04,129 --> 00:15:07,081
Hey, guys.

329
00:15:07,083 --> 00:15:08,999
Stuart.
Stuart.

330
00:15:09,001 --> 00:15:11,001
What are you doing?

331
00:15:11,003 --> 00:15:12,886
I...

332
00:15:12,888 --> 00:15:18,342
just wanted to be
in anyone's story.

333
00:15:18,344 --> 00:15:20,711
Yeah, but why are you fat?

334
00:15:22,764 --> 00:15:25,265
'Cause Leonard was fat.

335
00:15:27,102 --> 00:15:28,736
Amy, what about you?

336
00:15:28,738 --> 00:15:30,938
What do you think you'd be doing
if you never met Sheldon?

337
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:33,073
It's hard to say,

338
00:15:33,075 --> 00:15:35,326
my life would be
so... different.

339
00:15:35,328 --> 00:15:38,979
You can say "better."
Sheldon can't hear you.

340
00:15:40,248 --> 00:15:41,649
I don't know.

341
00:15:42,817 --> 00:15:46,887
? Happy birthday to me

342
00:15:47,656 --> 00:15:51,692
? Happy birthday
to me ?

343
00:15:53,094 --> 00:15:57,297
? There's tears
in the frosting ?

344
00:16:03,905 --> 00:16:08,042
? Happy birthday to me.

345
00:16:17,485 --> 00:16:19,153
I'll stop now.

346
00:16:22,657 --> 00:16:24,241
How's it going, Sheldon?

347
00:16:24,243 --> 00:16:25,692
That's it.

348
00:16:25,694 --> 00:16:27,461
The baby's here.

349
00:16:27,463 --> 00:16:28,528
It's a boy.

350
00:16:28,530 --> 00:16:30,330
Congrats.
Aw. - Yay.

351
00:16:30,332 --> 00:16:32,049
Oh, thank you.

352
00:16:32,051 --> 00:16:34,367
I wasn't sure I was
gonna to make it.

353
00:16:36,004 --> 00:16:39,056
But my mother
gave me some ice chips,

354
00:16:39,058 --> 00:16:41,091
my sister told me to breathe.

355
00:16:41,093 --> 00:16:43,043
And I just thought
to myself, "Sheldon,

356
00:16:43,045 --> 00:16:45,229
"if you can make it through
the <i>Green Lantern</i> movie,

357
00:16:45,231 --> 00:16:47,380
you can make it through this."

358
00:16:47,382 --> 00:16:49,750
Well, good
for you, buddy.

359
00:16:49,752 --> 00:16:51,201
We'll let you
get back in there.

360
00:16:51,203 --> 00:16:53,153
Oh no, no, I'm not
going back in there.

361
00:16:53,155 --> 00:16:55,889
That baby is so irritating.

362
00:16:55,891 --> 00:16:59,159
He has literally been
crying his entire life.

363
00:17:00,361 --> 00:17:03,297
Aw, he's already taking
after Uncle Shelly.

364
00:17:04,499 --> 00:17:06,417
Come on, Sheldon, you should go.

365
00:17:06,419 --> 00:17:07,584
Why?

366
00:17:07,586 --> 00:17:09,520
Well, you always
complain that you never

367
00:17:09,522 --> 00:17:11,588
had an intelligent
role model growing up,

368
00:17:11,590 --> 00:17:13,824
and now you can
be one for your nephew.

369
00:17:16,077 --> 00:17:18,045
Ugh, all right, I'll go.

370
00:17:18,997 --> 00:17:21,014
But from what I've seen,
his attention span

371
00:17:21,016 --> 00:17:23,467
is as limited
as his bladder control.

372
00:17:24,803 --> 00:17:26,720
You actually
got him to do it.

373
00:17:26,722 --> 00:17:27,921
Yeah, you keep saying

374
00:17:27,923 --> 00:17:29,640
how much Sheldon has
affected all of us,

375
00:17:29,642 --> 00:17:32,025
but you've clearly
had an impact on him.

376
00:17:32,027 --> 00:17:33,644
If that were true,

377
00:17:33,646 --> 00:17:35,612
I wouldn't still
be living alone.

378
00:17:35,614 --> 00:17:36,930
Well, not exactly alone.

379
00:17:36,932 --> 00:17:39,199
I do have a 50 pound
sack of rice

380
00:17:39,201 --> 00:17:42,069
with one of Sheldon's
T-shirts on it.

381
00:17:44,672 --> 00:17:47,875
I'm telling you, Sheldon cares
for you more than you think.

382
00:17:47,877 --> 00:17:50,443
I wish I could believe you.

383
00:17:50,445 --> 00:17:53,147
I also wish there wasn't a mouse
living in Rice Sheldon.

384
00:17:56,284 --> 00:17:58,001
Hang on, I'm gonna
give you a little

385
00:17:58,003 --> 00:18:00,287
early Christmas
present.

386
00:18:00,289 --> 00:18:02,840
I'm gonna show you something,
but if you ever told Sheldon

387
00:18:02,842 --> 00:18:04,758
he'd probably never
speak to me again.

388
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:07,344
So, if you want to
tell him, that's fine.

389
00:18:07,346 --> 00:18:09,429
Look.

390
00:18:12,183 --> 00:18:14,568
I don't understand.

391
00:18:14,570 --> 00:18:16,987
He made you
his screensaver.

392
00:18:18,139 --> 00:18:19,940
Oh.

393
00:18:19,942 --> 00:18:21,074
Wow.

394
00:18:21,076 --> 00:18:24,278
I had no idea.

395
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:26,914
He is so into me.

396
00:18:28,783 --> 00:18:30,267
Wait, wait,

397
00:18:30,269 --> 00:18:31,318
where'd I go?

398
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:33,670
Oh, well, it's
you, Swamp Thing,

399
00:18:33,672 --> 00:18:34,705
Stephen Hawking,
Spider-Man...

400
00:18:34,707 --> 00:18:37,174
but, look, you're
in the mix.

401
00:18:37,176 --> 00:18:39,492
I <i>am</i> in the mix.

402
00:18:39,494 --> 00:18:41,461
And I'm the hottest one.

403
00:18:41,463 --> 00:18:42,713
Who's that?

404
00:18:42,715 --> 00:18:44,464
Oh, Madame C.

405
00:18:44,466 --> 00:18:46,633
That's fine, she's dead.

406
00:18:59,113 --> 00:19:00,814
You okay?

407
00:19:01,733 --> 00:19:04,017
Just really glad
you're back.

408
00:19:04,019 --> 00:19:05,652
Me, too.

409
00:19:06,739 --> 00:19:09,356
I got a lot of TV
to catch up on.

410
00:19:15,213 --> 00:19:17,297
I missed you.

411
00:19:17,299 --> 00:19:20,834
To quote Han Solo,
"I know""

412
00:19:24,538 --> 00:19:26,473
Did you miss me?

413
00:19:26,475 --> 00:19:29,059
I would've preferred
to have you there with me.

414
00:19:29,061 --> 00:19:30,761
Oh.

415
00:19:30,763 --> 00:19:32,596
Or instead of me.

416
00:19:35,883 --> 00:19:37,267
Did you hold the baby?

417
00:19:37,269 --> 00:19:38,852
I did.

418
00:19:38,854 --> 00:19:40,354
And?

419
00:19:40,356 --> 00:19:42,739
How did it make you feel?

420
00:19:42,741 --> 00:19:45,025
Looking into the
blank, innocent eyes

421
00:19:45,027 --> 00:19:47,194
of a creature that
couldn't begin to comprehend

422
00:19:47,196 --> 00:19:48,895
anything I was saying?

423
00:19:48,897 --> 00:19:51,748
Basically just
another day at the office.

424
00:20:00,426 --> 00:20:02,127
I'm gonna do it.

425
00:20:02,129 --> 00:20:03,762
I'm gonna ask her out.

426
00:20:06,015 --> 00:20:09,501
Yeah, and chocolate milk is
gonna squirt out of my nipples.

427
00:20:10,470 --> 00:20:13,171
Put up or shut up.
You make it, I'll drink it.

428
00:20:18,311 --> 00:20:19,695
You guys need anything else?
Uh,

429
00:20:19,697 --> 00:20:22,147
your phone number
and one more cheesecake.

430
00:20:24,817 --> 00:20:26,451
I'm sorry, I have a boyfriend.

431
00:20:26,453 --> 00:20:29,288
In fact, there
he is now.

432
00:20:38,222 --> 00:20:39,609
Ready to go, sweetheart?

433
00:20:39,610 --> 00:20:41,860
Not until I get
my kiss.
