1
00:00:02,392 --> 00:00:04,142
So...

2
00:00:04,144 --> 00:00:07,045
couldn't help but notice
none of you RSVP'd

3
00:00:07,047 --> 00:00:08,880
to my murder mystery
dinner party.

4
00:00:08,882 --> 00:00:10,165
Oh, yeah.

5
00:00:10,167 --> 00:00:12,317
We were meaning
to do that.

6
00:00:12,319 --> 00:00:13,785
No, you weren't
because it was a week ago

7
00:00:13,787 --> 00:00:15,737
and nobody came!

8
00:00:16,823 --> 00:00:18,707
So, if you want to solve
the mystery of who stabbed

9
00:00:18,709 --> 00:00:20,608
Koothrappali in the back
with the weapon of indifference,

10
00:00:20,610 --> 00:00:22,828
it was all of you.

11
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:25,113
I don't think that
qualifies as a mystery.

12
00:00:25,115 --> 00:00:27,349
We all knew what
we were doing.

13
00:00:28,384 --> 00:00:30,752
We're sorry, Rajesh.

14
00:00:30,754 --> 00:00:32,337
Maybe we can do it next week.

15
00:00:32,339 --> 00:00:34,473
Whoa, whoa, we're
not that sorry.

16
00:00:34,475 --> 00:00:36,408
Don't worry, I can take a hint.

17
00:00:36,410 --> 00:00:38,460
No more murder mystery parties.

18
00:00:38,462 --> 00:00:39,945
Great. Thank you.
Hallelujah.

19
00:00:39,947 --> 00:00:41,813
Because I've got something
even better planned.

20
00:00:41,815 --> 00:00:43,565
Aw! Why?
Come on.

21
00:00:43,567 --> 00:00:45,016
Just hear me out.

22
00:00:45,018 --> 00:00:46,251
I'm going to make you guys

23
00:00:46,253 --> 00:00:48,804
a scavenger hunt
like they have at M.I.T.

24
00:00:48,806 --> 00:00:50,322
Oh...

25
00:00:50,324 --> 00:00:51,323
I loved those.

26
00:00:51,325 --> 00:00:52,758
I did them every year there.

27
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:53,875
We did them at Princeton, too.

28
00:00:53,877 --> 00:00:54,826
Oh, that's cute.

29
00:00:54,828 --> 00:00:56,495
Like it's a real college.

30
00:00:57,830 --> 00:01:00,048
That's amusing-- I was going
to say that about M.I.T.,

31
00:01:00,050 --> 00:01:02,451
but it works for Princeton, too.

32
00:01:03,986 --> 00:01:05,771
Scavenger hunts at Harvard
were really tough.

33
00:01:05,773 --> 00:01:07,773
I always got stuck on
the first challenge--

34
00:01:07,775 --> 00:01:09,558
trying to find someone
to be on a team with me.

35
00:01:11,845 --> 00:01:14,863
I guess that story's
more sad than funny.

36
00:01:16,916 --> 00:01:17,966
I love scavenger hunts.

37
00:01:17,968 --> 00:01:19,267
My friends and I had them
all the time.

38
00:01:19,269 --> 00:01:20,668
Oh, these are a
little different.

39
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:22,971
There's a tradition
at elite universities.

40
00:01:22,973 --> 00:01:24,523
And Princeton.

41
00:01:24,525 --> 00:01:26,842
A tradition of hunts

42
00:01:26,844 --> 00:01:28,894
full of puzzles
that rely on logic

43
00:01:28,896 --> 00:01:31,679
and obscure knowledge, science.

44
00:01:31,681 --> 00:01:33,815
Oh, in ours we would just run
around town looking for a store

45
00:01:33,817 --> 00:01:36,151
that would sell us beer.

46
00:01:37,453 --> 00:01:38,370
So, uh, who's in?

47
00:01:38,372 --> 00:01:40,639
I think it sounds fun.
Yeah, me, too.

48
00:01:40,641 --> 00:01:41,873
I'm in.
Let's do it.

49
00:01:42,742 --> 00:01:44,209
I'm sorry.
Are we really doing this

50
00:01:44,211 --> 00:01:45,994
or are we tricking
Koothrappali again

51
00:01:45,996 --> 00:01:47,996
like with the dinner party?

52
00:01:49,048 --> 00:01:52,551
? Our whole universe
was in a hot, dense state ?

53
00:01:52,553 --> 00:01:55,887
? Then nearly 14 billion years
ago expansion started... Wait! ?

54
00:01:55,889 --> 00:01:57,539
? The Earth began to cool

55
00:01:57,541 --> 00:02:00,058
? The autotrophs began to drool,
Neanderthals developed tools ?

56
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:02,727
? We built the Wall
? <i>We built the pyramids</i> ?

57
00:02:02,729 --> 00:02:05,397
? Math, Science, History,
unraveling the mystery ?

58
00:02:05,399 --> 00:02:07,315
? That all started
with a big bang ?

59
00:02:07,317 --> 00:02:08,222
? <i>Bang!</i> ?

What's all this?

63
00:02:19,331 --> 00:02:21,631
Oh, everything
I could possibly need

64
00:02:21,633 --> 00:02:24,384
to win the scavenger hunt.

65
00:02:24,386 --> 00:02:26,219
You really think he's gonna
send us to a bowling alley?

66
00:02:26,221 --> 00:02:28,488
Well, if he does,

67
00:02:28,490 --> 00:02:30,724
do you know how filthy
those rental balls are?

68
00:02:31,943 --> 00:02:33,260
They might as well
stand on the corner

69
00:02:33,262 --> 00:02:35,479
and give away free rectal exams.

70
00:02:39,351 --> 00:02:40,934
Okay, everybody.

71
00:02:40,936 --> 00:02:43,236
Who's ready for a...

72
00:02:44,539 --> 00:02:47,274
...scavenger
hunt?

74
00:03:04,243 --> 00:03:06,159
Somewhere...

75
00:03:06,161 --> 00:03:08,295
in the city of Pasadena,

76
00:03:08,297 --> 00:03:09,513
I've hidden

77
00:03:09,515 --> 00:03:12,632
a golden coin.

78
00:03:12,634 --> 00:03:13,867
Oh!

79
00:03:13,869 --> 00:03:16,636
You will be faced with a total

80
00:03:16,638 --> 00:03:19,222
of ten puzzles!

81
00:03:21,042 --> 00:03:22,943
Each p...

82
00:03:24,613 --> 00:03:26,630
Each...

83
00:03:26,632 --> 00:03:28,365
each puzzle will lead you

84
00:03:28,367 --> 00:03:30,784
to the location of the next.

85
00:03:30,786 --> 00:03:32,269
The last of which

86
00:03:32,271 --> 00:03:35,822
will lead you to the coin.

87
00:03:36,908 --> 00:03:38,325
The first team that finds it...

88
00:03:38,327 --> 00:03:42,245
wins!

89
00:03:43,331 --> 00:03:45,165
He is a born showman.

90
00:03:47,051 --> 00:03:49,636
Any questions?

91
00:03:50,838 --> 00:03:52,239
Yes, to be fair, do people

92
00:03:52,241 --> 00:03:54,958
who went to Princeton
get a head start?

93
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,476
That's not funny.

94
00:03:56,478 --> 00:03:59,613
Oh, it actually is
if you get the joke.

95
00:03:59,615 --> 00:04:00,814
It's based on the premise

96
00:04:00,816 --> 00:04:03,400
that Princeton isn't
a very good school.

97
00:04:03,402 --> 00:04:04,701
Ha-ha.

98
00:04:04,703 --> 00:04:07,320
Oh, see? Now he gets it.

99
00:04:07,322 --> 00:04:09,322
Okay, guys, go ahead

100
00:04:09,324 --> 00:04:11,324
and divide yourselves
into teams of two.

101
00:04:11,326 --> 00:04:13,093
Should we just do couples?

102
00:04:13,095 --> 00:04:14,110
Couples sounds great.

103
00:04:14,112 --> 00:04:15,745
Or we could mix things up.

104
00:04:15,747 --> 00:04:17,197
Maybe pick names out of a hat.

105
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:18,398
Whatever.

106
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:19,366
Whoa, whoa...

107
00:04:19,368 --> 00:04:21,618
whoa.

108
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:22,752
Why don't you just admit

109
00:04:22,754 --> 00:04:24,621
you don't want to be
on a team with me.

110
00:04:24,623 --> 00:04:26,773
I just said,
"Couples sound great."

111
00:04:26,775 --> 00:04:28,575
Mm-hmm, yeah, you don't
think I'm smart enough.

112
00:04:28,577 --> 00:04:30,427
You think I'm gonna
be a liability.

113
00:04:30,429 --> 00:04:31,761
Even though I
totally just used

114
00:04:31,763 --> 00:04:33,079
the word "liability"
correctly

115
00:04:33,081 --> 00:04:36,016
in a sentence.

116
00:04:36,018 --> 00:04:38,552
Yeah.

117
00:04:38,554 --> 00:04:39,886
All right,
let's-let's do couples.

118
00:04:39,888 --> 00:04:40,971
I want to.

119
00:04:40,973 --> 00:04:42,022
No, no.

120
00:04:42,024 --> 00:04:43,390
Let's mix things up.

121
00:04:43,392 --> 00:04:45,625
I choose Sheldon,
and we're gonna kick your ass!

122
00:04:45,627 --> 00:04:47,727
Yeah... really?

123
00:04:47,729 --> 00:04:49,563
The only time I'm ever
picked first for a team

124
00:04:49,565 --> 00:04:52,032
and I'm stuck
with the liability?

125
00:04:53,618 --> 00:04:55,768
Stop that.
Penny is not a liability.

126
00:04:55,770 --> 00:04:57,737
Thank you. Do you want
to be on my team?

127
00:04:57,739 --> 00:05:00,824
Maybe we pick names
out of a hat.

128
00:05:01,942 --> 00:05:03,710
All right, hurry up
and close the door

129
00:05:03,712 --> 00:05:04,878
so they can't hear us.

130
00:05:10,034 --> 00:05:11,635
Would you stop pouting?

131
00:05:11,637 --> 00:05:12,786
So, you picked my name.

132
00:05:12,788 --> 00:05:14,104
Get over it.

133
00:05:14,106 --> 00:05:17,007
Yes, and do you know
what the odds are

134
00:05:17,009 --> 00:05:18,592
I'd pick your name?

135
00:05:18,594 --> 00:05:19,643
No.

136
00:05:19,645 --> 00:05:21,561
It's not hard-- one in five.

137
00:05:21,563 --> 00:05:23,813
Now you know why I'm pouting.

138
00:05:24,999 --> 00:05:26,466
All right, teams.

139
00:05:26,468 --> 00:05:28,885
Get ready to open
your first puzzle.

140
00:05:28,887 --> 00:05:31,087
Go!

141
00:05:32,189 --> 00:05:34,057
Do you see what I did?

142
00:05:34,059 --> 00:05:36,576
The first puzzle is a puzzle!

143
00:05:36,578 --> 00:05:39,029
Oh, my God,
how adorable is that?

144
00:05:40,581 --> 00:05:42,782
I wish I had a friend like me.

145
00:05:43,918 --> 00:05:45,318
What are you doing?

146
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:46,786
You have to start
with the edges.

147
00:05:46,788 --> 00:05:47,987
Well, there's
no right way, Sheldon.

148
00:05:47,989 --> 00:05:49,506
I already found
a few pieces that fit.

149
00:05:49,508 --> 00:05:53,176
Yeah, well, take them apart
and start with the edges.

150
00:05:54,428 --> 00:05:56,263
And stop wasting time.

151
00:05:57,331 --> 00:06:00,016
Wow, you're really
good at puzzles.

152
00:06:00,018 --> 00:06:01,768
I did them all
the time as a kid.

153
00:06:01,770 --> 00:06:03,053
As my mom used to say,

154
00:06:03,055 --> 00:06:04,170
"When you're doing a puzzle,

155
00:06:04,172 --> 00:06:07,540
it's like having a
thousand friends."

156
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:11,611
She was full of fun
lies like that.

157
00:06:11,613 --> 00:06:13,113
If it makes you feel
any better,

158
00:06:13,115 --> 00:06:15,949
my mom's just full
of pound cake.

159
00:06:15,951 --> 00:06:17,984
I'm sorry you got
stuck with me.

160
00:06:17,986 --> 00:06:19,819
I bet you wanted to
be with Bernadette.

161
00:06:19,821 --> 00:06:21,488
Have you ever played
a game with Bernadette?

162
00:06:21,490 --> 00:06:23,423
No.

163
00:06:23,425 --> 00:06:24,391
Have you ever gone

164
00:06:24,393 --> 00:06:26,893
into a steel cage
with a wolverine?

165
00:06:27,762 --> 00:06:29,079
Faster, faster, faster!

166
00:06:29,081 --> 00:06:30,213
Do you not know that word?

167
00:06:30,215 --> 00:06:31,982
It means "more fast"!

168
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:34,334
Stop yelling at me.

169
00:06:34,336 --> 00:06:35,502
Hey!

170
00:06:35,504 --> 00:06:38,705
You'll know when
I'm yelling at you.

171
00:06:38,707 --> 00:06:40,090
Ooh, ooh, it's
the comic book store!

172
00:06:40,092 --> 00:06:41,091
All right, come on.

173
00:06:41,093 --> 00:06:42,542
That's where we have to go.

174
00:06:42,544 --> 00:06:44,127
But we haven't
finished the puzzle.

175
00:06:44,129 --> 00:06:46,313
Well, it-it doesn't matter!

176
00:06:46,315 --> 00:06:47,564
We know the answer!

177
00:06:47,566 --> 00:06:49,866
Come on.
You think you know the answer.

178
00:06:49,868 --> 00:06:51,518
But it could be a trick.

179
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:53,219
What if when
the puzzle's complete,

180
00:06:53,221 --> 00:06:55,105
there's a sign
in the window that says,

181
00:06:55,107 --> 00:06:57,073
"Go to the train store"?

182
00:06:57,075 --> 00:06:59,092
Okay, it's not gonna say that.

183
00:06:59,094 --> 00:07:00,727
Well, I hope you're wrong.

184
00:07:00,729 --> 00:07:03,363
I really want to go
to the train store.

185
00:07:04,382 --> 00:07:05,682
It's the comic book store.

186
00:07:05,684 --> 00:07:07,701
Let's go!

187
00:07:07,703 --> 00:07:09,953
Come on, numb nuts,
it's the comic book store!

188
00:07:17,095 --> 00:07:19,129
It's the comic book store,
it's the comic book store,

189
00:07:19,131 --> 00:07:20,964
it's the comic book store!

190
00:07:30,358 --> 00:07:32,442
It's the comic book store.

191
00:07:39,266 --> 00:07:40,867
Do you think
Penny's mad at me?

192
00:07:40,869 --> 00:07:42,285
Because you're
in the right lane

193
00:07:42,287 --> 00:07:43,703
behind a bus
and you won't go around it?

194
00:07:43,705 --> 00:07:46,539
I'm sure
she finds it charming.

195
00:07:46,541 --> 00:07:49,442
No, because I didn't
want her on my team.

196
00:07:49,444 --> 00:07:51,378
I'm starting to think
she dodged a bullet.

197
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:54,080
The slowest bullet in the world.

198
00:07:55,633 --> 00:07:58,084
Geez, I never realized
you were so competitive.

199
00:07:58,086 --> 00:08:00,053
Yeah, I know.

200
00:08:00,055 --> 00:08:01,638
It's-it's probably
because I grew up

201
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:02,955
with five brothers and sisters

202
00:08:02,957 --> 00:08:04,257
so I had to fight for every...

203
00:08:04,259 --> 00:08:06,926
Oh, my God, you did not
just slow down for a bird!

204
00:08:06,928 --> 00:08:08,895
You know they fly, right?!

205
00:08:14,151 --> 00:08:15,802
I think this is
the first time we've ever

206
00:08:15,804 --> 00:08:17,353
actually been alone together.

207
00:08:17,355 --> 00:08:19,773
Huh, I guess
you're right.

208
00:08:19,775 --> 00:08:21,524
Wonder why that is?

209
00:08:21,526 --> 00:08:24,444
Well, off the top of my head,
I'd say we don't have a lot

210
00:08:24,446 --> 00:08:26,486
in common except for the people
we're involved with.

211
00:08:27,498 --> 00:08:29,032
Plus, when we first met,
Penny warned me never

212
00:08:29,034 --> 00:08:31,835
to get into a car
alone with you.

213
00:08:31,837 --> 00:08:34,037
Yeah.

214
00:08:36,173 --> 00:08:39,759
You know, I bet you and I have
more in common than we think.

215
00:08:39,761 --> 00:08:41,394
Such as?

216
00:08:41,396 --> 00:08:42,879
I don't know.

217
00:08:42,881 --> 00:08:44,631
Tell me some things you like.

218
00:08:44,633 --> 00:08:45,715
Uh, let's see.

219
00:08:45,717 --> 00:08:48,668
I like harps,
<i>Little House on the Prairie,</i>

220
00:08:48,670 --> 00:08:51,471
medieval poetry,
medieval literature...

221
00:08:51,473 --> 00:08:53,339
Hey, how about some music?

222
00:08:53,341 --> 00:08:55,708
Great.

223
00:08:55,710 --> 00:08:57,343
Sheldon never lets me
listen to music in the car.

224
00:08:57,345 --> 00:09:00,480
He doesn't want to be mistaken
for a gang member.

225
00:09:01,065 --> 00:09:03,199
Find something you like.

226
00:09:03,201 --> 00:09:05,034
Beatles, boring.

227
00:09:05,036 --> 00:09:07,454
Eminem, scary.

228
00:09:07,456 --> 00:09:08,738
Weird Al?

229
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:11,774
How old are you?

230
00:09:11,776 --> 00:09:13,576
Neil Diamond?

231
00:09:13,578 --> 00:09:16,045
Yeah, I love Neil Diamond.

232
00:09:16,047 --> 00:09:17,914
I love Neil Diamond.

233
00:09:21,469 --> 00:09:24,203
? Sweet Caroline

234
00:09:24,205 --> 00:09:26,139
? Bum-ba-da

235
00:09:26,141 --> 00:09:29,092
? Good times
never seemed so good ?

236
00:09:29,094 --> 00:09:31,811
? So good, so good, so good ?

237
00:09:31,813 --> 00:09:34,097
? I've been... ?

238
00:09:40,955 --> 00:09:42,571
Oh, hey, thanks
for letting me use

239
00:09:42,573 --> 00:09:44,256
the comic book store
as part of the scavenger hunt.

240
00:09:44,258 --> 00:09:45,474
Oh, my pleasure.

241
00:09:45,476 --> 00:09:47,175
Always happy to help out
with fun things

242
00:09:47,177 --> 00:09:50,045
that I wasn't invited
to be a part of.

243
00:09:50,047 --> 00:09:52,614
Oh, congratulations.

244
00:09:52,616 --> 00:09:54,049
You're the first team
to arrive.

245
00:09:54,051 --> 00:09:56,101
Yes! It's not a ruse
to make fun of me.

246
00:09:56,103 --> 00:10:00,188
It's a real game
and I'm winning it!

247
00:10:00,974 --> 00:10:04,242
Your next puzzle is a riddle.

248
00:10:04,244 --> 00:10:05,994
And who better
to give it to you

249
00:10:05,996 --> 00:10:09,781
than The Riddler?

250
00:10:09,783 --> 00:10:11,783
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go,

251
00:10:11,785 --> 00:10:13,919
go, go, go, go,
go, go, go!

252
00:10:13,921 --> 00:10:15,737
How am I faster than you?

253
00:10:15,739 --> 00:10:19,007
I'm wearing heels and I stopped
to take a phone call.

254
00:10:19,009 --> 00:10:20,959
I have asthma.

255
00:10:20,961 --> 00:10:23,478
Back off!

256
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:24,830
"Riddle me this.

257
00:10:24,832 --> 00:10:27,683
"Arrah, Arrah, and gather round,

258
00:10:27,685 --> 00:10:30,469
"the work of this hero
is legion-bound.

259
00:10:30,471 --> 00:10:32,888
"He multiplies N
by the number of He,

260
00:10:32,890 --> 00:10:36,858
and in this room
the thing you'll see."

261
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:38,310
Good riddle, huh?
Yeah.

262
00:10:38,312 --> 00:10:40,062
So when you guys
plan fun activities,

263
00:10:40,064 --> 00:10:41,647
does my name even...

264
00:10:41,649 --> 00:10:44,199
come up, or...?

265
00:10:45,735 --> 00:10:47,536
I invited you to my
murder mystery party.

266
00:10:47,538 --> 00:10:50,072
No, you didn't.

267
00:10:51,174 --> 00:10:53,158
Oh.

268
00:10:55,229 --> 00:10:56,528
We're the last ones here,
hurry up!

269
00:10:56,530 --> 00:10:58,830
It is a marathon,
not a sprint.

270
00:10:58,832 --> 00:10:59,998
People run
in a marathon!

271
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,034
Not with a bowling ball
on their back.

272
00:11:02,036 --> 00:11:04,603
Hey, Penny, I just
wanted to say good luck,

273
00:11:04,605 --> 00:11:05,954
and I hope there's
no hard feelings.

274
00:11:05,956 --> 00:11:07,222
Hey, Romeo!

275
00:11:07,224 --> 00:11:09,725
Repair your relationship
on your own time.

276
00:11:10,893 --> 00:11:12,928
Relax, it's
a hard puzzle.

277
00:11:12,930 --> 00:11:14,296
It's gonna take
a while to solve.

278
00:11:14,298 --> 00:11:16,114
"Riddle me this..."
Got it.

279
00:11:17,550 --> 00:11:19,017
Hey, Princeton,
look at that,

280
00:11:19,019 --> 00:11:21,302
Team Community College
Night School is in the lead.

281
00:11:22,321 --> 00:11:25,907
I thought we were
the Lightning Sharks.

282
00:11:27,226 --> 00:11:29,444
Hey, you know what
this could mean...

283
00:11:29,446 --> 00:11:31,913
Oh, oh, that's good.

284
00:11:31,915 --> 00:11:34,082
Then this
would be...

285
00:11:34,084 --> 00:11:34,900
That's it.

286
00:11:34,902 --> 00:11:36,585
To the Neil Mobile!

287
00:11:38,237 --> 00:11:40,338
I knew it,
we're gonna lose!

288
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:42,007
Wait, I got it.
I got it!

289
00:11:42,009 --> 00:11:44,793
Congratulations,
you got it last.

290
00:11:50,516 --> 00:11:52,667
You're really mean,
you know that?

291
00:12:00,376 --> 00:12:03,211
So no one's gonna buy anything.

292
00:12:05,615 --> 00:12:07,065
Aha!

293
00:12:07,067 --> 00:12:08,617
Okay...

294
00:12:08,619 --> 00:12:10,235
Let's see.

295
00:12:10,237 --> 00:12:11,453
"To continue
on your quest,

296
00:12:11,455 --> 00:12:12,904
leave no stone unturned."

297
00:12:12,906 --> 00:12:13,955
Ooh.

298
00:12:13,957 --> 00:12:15,240
The next clue
must be hidden

299
00:12:15,242 --> 00:12:16,374
under one of
these rocks.

300
00:12:16,376 --> 00:12:18,543
Oh. Okay.

301
00:12:18,545 --> 00:12:19,778
Sheldon,
I-I've got to ask.

302
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:22,514
How did you figure out
that it was the geology lab?

303
00:12:22,516 --> 00:12:26,501
Oh, simple.

304
00:12:26,503 --> 00:12:28,336
a member of
the Legion of Superheroes,

305
00:12:28,338 --> 00:12:29,321
known as Element Lad.

306
00:12:29,323 --> 00:12:30,972
And then
the word "He,"

307
00:12:30,974 --> 00:12:32,641
it wasn't
the masculine pronoun,

308
00:12:32,643 --> 00:12:34,142
but rather, "H-E,"

309
00:12:34,144 --> 00:12:35,543
the abbreviation for helium.

310
00:12:35,545 --> 00:12:37,545
See where I'm going with this?

311
00:12:39,015 --> 00:12:40,749
Yes.

312
00:12:40,751 --> 00:12:42,417
Nice try.

313
00:12:42,419 --> 00:12:44,736
Now, Element
Lad's ability

314
00:12:44,738 --> 00:12:46,855
is the power to transmute
chemical elements.

315
00:12:46,857 --> 00:12:49,474
Helium has
an atomic number of two.

316
00:12:49,476 --> 00:12:52,077
If you multiply that
by the atomic number of "N"--

317
00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:53,495
nitrogen--

318
00:12:53,497 --> 00:12:57,983
you get 14, which is
the atomic number of...?

319
00:12:59,252 --> 00:13:01,153
I'm just funnin' you,
silicon.

320
00:13:01,155 --> 00:13:03,555
And that is
the most common element

321
00:13:03,557 --> 00:13:04,723
in the Earth's
surface.

322
00:13:04,725 --> 00:13:05,757
So that narrowed it down

323
00:13:05,759 --> 00:13:07,909
to the geology lab
or the chemistry lab.

324
00:13:07,911 --> 00:13:10,128
Wow.

325
00:13:10,130 --> 00:13:13,014
I can drink a beer underwater.

326
00:13:13,016 --> 00:13:15,767
And I'm sure
your parents are proud.

327
00:13:15,769 --> 00:13:17,335
Now, finally,

328
00:13:17,337 --> 00:13:20,188
the line "in this room
the thing you'll see"

329
00:13:20,190 --> 00:13:21,589
was an obvious reference

330
00:13:21,591 --> 00:13:23,558
to Fantastic Four member
The Thing,

331
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:24,743
who's made entirely of...

332
00:13:24,745 --> 00:13:26,278
Shut up.

333
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:27,595
I solved it.

334
00:13:31,935 --> 00:13:33,618
Those are map
coordinates.

335
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:34,953
Got 'em.
Let's go.

336
00:13:36,038 --> 00:13:37,289
Well, wait.

337
00:13:37,291 --> 00:13:39,074
D-Don't you want to know
how I figured it out?

338
00:13:39,076 --> 00:13:40,942
No one likes
a know-it-all, Penny.

339
00:13:45,164 --> 00:13:49,167
? On the boats
and on the planes ?

340
00:13:49,169 --> 00:13:52,921
? They're coming to America ?

341
00:13:52,923 --> 00:13:56,708
? Never looking back again

342
00:13:56,710 --> 00:13:59,561
? They're coming to America... ?

343
00:14:05,017 --> 00:14:07,969
Um, I'm okay with you
driving my car.

344
00:14:07,971 --> 00:14:10,989
I'm not okay
with you flying my car.

345
00:14:10,991 --> 00:14:13,108
Don't sweat it, my dad's a cop.
He can fix things.

346
00:14:14,278 --> 00:14:15,243
Uh-huh.

347
00:14:15,245 --> 00:14:17,112
Like death?

348
00:14:17,114 --> 00:14:19,414
Your kid may be
an honor student

349
00:14:19,416 --> 00:14:20,949
but you're a moron!

350
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:25,620
Penny's not answering my texts.

351
00:14:25,622 --> 00:14:27,589
Who cares?
Focus on the game.

352
00:14:27,591 --> 00:14:30,158
This stupid game is why
she's mad in the first place.

353
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:31,259
I'm telling her I'm quitting.

354
00:14:31,261 --> 00:14:32,210
No!

355
00:14:32,212 --> 00:14:33,428
Quitting would be
the worst thing

356
00:14:33,430 --> 00:14:34,596
for your relationship.

357
00:14:34,598 --> 00:14:35,663
Why?

358
00:14:35,665 --> 00:14:37,098
Because it would
make you seem like

359
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:39,000
something she already
thinks you are.

360
00:14:39,002 --> 00:14:41,002
What does she think I am?

361
00:14:41,004 --> 00:14:43,221
How do I put this?

362
00:14:43,223 --> 00:14:45,807
She's been known
to call you a name

363
00:14:45,809 --> 00:14:48,977
that usually applies
to a lady part.

364
00:14:50,479 --> 00:14:52,013
Or a cat.

365
00:14:53,783 --> 00:14:56,201
Or a willow.

366
00:14:59,071 --> 00:15:01,473
I can't believe
she would say that about me.

367
00:15:01,475 --> 00:15:02,824
If you're gonna
cry about it

368
00:15:02,826 --> 00:15:04,976
there's tissues
in my purse.

369
00:15:04,978 --> 00:15:06,912
Unless you got some in yours.

370
00:15:06,914 --> 00:15:08,463
Big willow.

371
00:15:10,933 --> 00:15:14,669
? They're coming to America ?

372
00:15:14,671 --> 00:15:17,639
? They're coming
to America ?

373
00:15:17,641 --> 00:15:19,257
? Today

374
00:15:20,810 --> 00:15:22,978
? Today

375
00:15:25,481 --> 00:15:26,932
? Today

376
00:15:29,185 --> 00:15:32,020
? Today!

377
00:15:33,172 --> 00:15:37,192
Okay...
another 30 feet.

378
00:15:37,194 --> 00:15:38,526
Okay.

379
00:15:38,528 --> 00:15:39,661
Oh.

380
00:15:39,663 --> 00:15:41,997
It's a bowling
alley.

381
00:15:41,999 --> 00:15:43,114
Yes.

382
00:15:43,116 --> 00:15:44,232
Yes!

383
00:15:44,234 --> 00:15:48,420
My brain is better
than everybody's!

384
00:15:52,174 --> 00:15:55,360
? Love on the rocks

385
00:15:55,362 --> 00:15:57,578
? Ain't no big surprise ?

386
00:15:57,580 --> 00:16:00,181
? Just pour me a drink

387
00:16:00,183 --> 00:16:03,668
? And I'll tell you
some lies... ?

388
00:16:04,854 --> 00:16:06,754
Call me a lady part.

389
00:16:06,756 --> 00:16:08,923
We'll see about that.

390
00:16:11,444 --> 00:16:13,061
Can you reach the clue?

391
00:16:13,063 --> 00:16:13,828
Almost.

392
00:16:13,830 --> 00:16:15,447
Hurry, Sheldon and Penny

393
00:16:15,449 --> 00:16:17,282
were right behind us
in the bowling alley.

394
00:16:17,284 --> 00:16:18,867
Got it!

395
00:16:18,869 --> 00:16:20,118
Great,
climb back up.

396
00:16:21,971 --> 00:16:24,155
Come on!

397
00:16:26,575 --> 00:16:29,878
Yeah, Penny might
be onto something.

398
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:32,797
To the planetarium!

399
00:16:32,799 --> 00:16:33,798
Let's go!

400
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:35,083
To the tar pits!

401
00:16:35,085 --> 00:16:36,167
Let's go!

402
00:16:36,169 --> 00:16:37,969
There's a Neil Diamond
concert next month!

403
00:16:37,971 --> 00:16:40,055
Let's go!

404
00:16:42,258 --> 00:16:44,259
Three bags,
no one's opened 'em.

405
00:16:44,261 --> 00:16:45,393
We're the first ones here!

406
00:16:46,663 --> 00:16:48,629
It's dirty laundry. You're up.
What? You...

407
00:16:48,631 --> 00:16:49,597
Why me?

408
00:16:49,599 --> 00:16:50,899
Because you've
been training

409
00:16:50,901 --> 00:16:52,017
for this
your whole life.

410
00:16:52,019 --> 00:16:54,486
You live in a pile
of dirty laundry.

411
00:16:57,023 --> 00:16:58,273
They're here first.

412
00:16:58,275 --> 00:17:00,892
This is because you made me slow
down for that blind guy.

413
00:17:00,894 --> 00:17:03,161
Okay, the clue
must be in the bag.

414
00:17:03,163 --> 00:17:05,413
The clue must be
in the bag.

415
00:17:05,415 --> 00:17:06,448
What's... it's just
a bunch of pants.

416
00:17:06,450 --> 00:17:07,499
It's just
a bunch of pants.

417
00:17:07,501 --> 00:17:09,000
You know,
I'm surprised

418
00:17:09,002 --> 00:17:10,368
you want to copy
my answers

419
00:17:10,370 --> 00:17:12,170
since I'm not even smart
enough to be on your team.

420
00:17:12,172 --> 00:17:14,822
Well, why would you want to be
on someone's team

421
00:17:14,824 --> 00:17:16,157
who you like
to call a...

422
00:17:16,159 --> 00:17:18,159
I can't even say it
in front of Sheldon.

423
00:17:18,161 --> 00:17:20,495
What are you talking about?

424
00:17:20,497 --> 00:17:22,480
You know exactly what
I'm talking about.

425
00:17:22,482 --> 00:17:23,381
No, she doesn't.

426
00:17:23,383 --> 00:17:24,883
I just made
that up.

427
00:17:24,885 --> 00:17:27,168
Why would you do that?

428
00:17:27,170 --> 00:17:28,770
Because you were about
to quit like a big--

429
00:17:28,772 --> 00:17:30,138
Sheldon, cover your ears.

430
00:17:31,524 --> 00:17:33,441
I'm not a child.

431
00:17:33,443 --> 00:17:35,610
I know the word "ninny."

432
00:17:35,612 --> 00:17:36,795
Yeah, well, you
should have quit

433
00:17:36,797 --> 00:17:38,113
'cause I'm still
gonna beat your ass.

434
00:17:38,115 --> 00:17:40,315
Wish I had a man
like her on my team.

435
00:17:41,450 --> 00:17:42,617
Hey, I-I am every bit

436
00:17:42,619 --> 00:17:44,536
as much of
a man as Penny.

437
00:17:44,538 --> 00:17:46,621
Now, let's do this!

438
00:17:46,623 --> 00:17:49,457
Wait, it's not all pants,
there's one shirt.

439
00:17:49,459 --> 00:17:50,458
Oh.

440
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:52,210
Hey, that's my shirt.

441
00:17:52,212 --> 00:17:53,945
This one is, too.
No, no, that's not mine.

442
00:17:53,947 --> 00:17:54,963
That has a big
spot on it.

443
00:17:54,965 --> 00:17:55,964
But wait.

444
00:17:55,966 --> 00:17:56,998
So does this one.

445
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,967
Maybe the spot's
the clue.

446
00:18:03,872 --> 00:18:04,839
"Sheldon's spot."

447
00:18:04,841 --> 00:18:07,392
The coin is in your spot!

448
00:18:07,394 --> 00:18:09,594
Oh, that's clever.

449
00:18:09,596 --> 00:18:10,845
Hurry!

450
00:18:10,847 --> 00:18:12,313
Be there in a minute.

451
00:18:12,315 --> 00:18:13,848
I just have to pre-soak these!

452
00:18:19,722 --> 00:18:22,307
Stop her, Leonard!
Stop her!

453
00:18:30,116 --> 00:18:31,749
Well, where the
hell's the coin?

454
00:18:31,751 --> 00:18:33,168
Wasn't the answer
Sheldon's spot?

455
00:18:33,170 --> 00:18:35,670
Oh, yes, Leonard.

456
00:18:35,672 --> 00:18:37,872
Yes, it was.

457
00:18:38,791 --> 00:18:40,525
Then where's the coin?

458
00:18:40,527 --> 00:18:42,293
Yes, exactly.

459
00:18:42,295 --> 00:18:43,678
Where is the coin?

460
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:47,382
Why don't you look
in your pockets?

461
00:18:51,554 --> 00:18:54,556
I slipped them in there
earlier today.

462
00:18:55,841 --> 00:18:57,475
I don't get it.

463
00:18:57,477 --> 00:18:59,444
Don't you see?

464
00:18:59,446 --> 00:19:01,196
When we're all
having fun together,

465
00:19:01,198 --> 00:19:03,281
we're already winners.

466
00:19:03,283 --> 00:19:04,449
Oh, look.

467
00:19:04,451 --> 00:19:05,766
See?

468
00:19:05,768 --> 00:19:08,236
Even I'm a winner.

469
00:19:09,071 --> 00:19:11,272
Are you
kidding me?

470
00:19:12,408 --> 00:19:15,243
That is the stupidest
thing I've ever heard.

471
00:19:16,228 --> 00:19:20,398
You suck so hard.

472
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,667
Well, I thought...

473
00:19:22,669 --> 00:19:24,452
Come on,
I didn't want anyone

474
00:19:24,454 --> 00:19:26,137
to feel bad at the end
of the game.

475
00:19:26,139 --> 00:19:28,590
And some of those puzzles
were really hard

476
00:19:28,592 --> 00:19:30,425
and I didn't know
who was gonna get Penny.

477
00:19:36,682 --> 00:19:38,383
Run.

478
00:19:38,385 --> 00:19:40,635
Okay, okay,
that-that came out wrong,

479
00:19:40,637 --> 00:19:41,969
but you have to admit,

480
00:19:41,971 --> 00:19:44,289
you all had a wonderful time.

481
00:19:45,341 --> 00:19:48,276
Run to India.

482
00:19:48,278 --> 00:19:51,312
I just wanted to do
something beautiful!

483
00:19:55,451 --> 00:19:56,451
Hey, look.

484
00:19:56,453 --> 00:19:58,620
I won.

485
00:20:08,730 --> 00:20:11,114
? Hey, she got
the way to move me ?

486
00:20:11,116 --> 00:20:12,165
? Cherry

487
00:20:12,167 --> 00:20:13,917
? She got the way to groove me

488
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:15,485
? Cherry, baby

489
00:20:15,487 --> 00:20:17,937
? She got the way to move me

490
00:20:17,939 --> 00:20:20,156
? She got the way to groove me

491
00:20:23,277 --> 00:20:25,128
? She got the way to move me

492
00:20:25,130 --> 00:20:26,129
? Cherry
