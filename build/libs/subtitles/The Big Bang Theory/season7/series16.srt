1
00:00:02,752 --> 00:00:05,253
I'm thinking
about growing a goatee.

2
00:00:05,255 --> 00:00:06,871
Oh, actually that's a Van Dyke.

3
00:00:06,873 --> 00:00:08,706
A goatee is
just hair on the chin.

4
00:00:08,708 --> 00:00:11,776
Oh. Wait, then what is it
if you just have hair up here?

5
00:00:11,778 --> 00:00:12,761
You mean a moustache?

6
00:00:12,763 --> 00:00:15,013
Moo-stache!
He said it!

7
00:00:15,015 --> 00:00:17,315
Ha-ha, very funny.
Make fun of the foreign guy.

8
00:00:17,317 --> 00:00:19,267
For your information, there
are four times as many

9
00:00:19,269 --> 00:00:22,020
Indians as there are Americans,
so the way we say it is right.

10
00:00:22,022 --> 00:00:23,271
Say what?
Moo-stache.

11
00:00:23,273 --> 00:00:24,623
Moo-stache!
He said "moo-stache".

12
00:00:26,025 --> 00:00:27,892
Guys, you're
being childish.

13
00:00:27,894 --> 00:00:29,727
Yeah, she's right.
You're grown men,

14
00:00:29,729 --> 00:00:31,229
the kind who are
perfectly capable

15
00:00:31,231 --> 00:00:33,731
of growing your
own moo-staches.

16
00:00:34,834 --> 00:00:38,670
Hey, you were funny
on purpose-- good job.

17
00:00:38,672 --> 00:00:41,089
Hi. Sorry I'm late--
I was at an audition.

18
00:00:41,091 --> 00:00:43,675
Oh, I'm sorry.
You'll get 'em next time.

19
00:00:45,077 --> 00:00:48,780
How about instead of assuming I
failed, you ask me how it went?

20
00:00:48,782 --> 00:00:50,432
Sorry. How did it go?

21
00:00:50,434 --> 00:00:52,350
Just shut up.

22
00:00:52,352 --> 00:00:53,835
Here, you can
have your seat.

23
00:00:53,837 --> 00:00:56,421
No, no, no, stay there.
I'm fine on the floor.

24
00:00:56,423 --> 00:00:58,940
Have you guys ever thought about
getting a dining room table?

25
00:00:58,942 --> 00:01:01,359
Yeah. You actually do have
room for one up there.

26
00:01:01,361 --> 00:01:04,479
Oh, sure, I sit on the floor
for years, no one cares.

27
00:01:04,481 --> 00:01:06,031
The pretty white girl's
there ten seconds,

28
00:01:06,033 --> 00:01:08,400
and suddenly we're
all running to IKEA.

29
00:01:09,869 --> 00:01:11,319
No one is
running anywhere.

30
00:01:11,321 --> 00:01:13,238
We're not getting
a dining room table.

31
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:14,956
I know you don't
like change,

32
00:01:14,958 --> 00:01:16,374
but it's not a terrible idea.

33
00:01:16,376 --> 00:01:18,159
Yeah, you guys never use
that space up there.

34
00:01:18,161 --> 00:01:19,311
Why not get a table?

35
00:01:19,313 --> 00:01:21,229
Do you want the long answer
or the short answer?

36
00:01:21,231 --> 00:01:23,781
Hey, how come <i>we</i> never
get that option?

37
00:01:24,967 --> 00:01:28,086
Chaos theory suggests that
even in a deterministic system,

38
00:01:28,088 --> 00:01:31,139
if the equations describing
its behavior are nonlinear,

39
00:01:31,141 --> 00:01:33,642
a tiny change
in the initial conditions

40
00:01:33,644 --> 00:01:37,128
can lead to a cataclysmic
and unpredictable result.

41
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:38,647
Translation?

42
00:01:38,649 --> 00:01:41,900
Waah. I don't want a table!

43
00:01:44,770 --> 00:01:48,406
? Our whole universe
was in a hot, dense state ?

44
00:01:48,408 --> 00:01:51,743
? Then nearly 14 billion years
ago expansion started... Wait! ?

45
00:01:51,745 --> 00:01:53,328
? The Earth began to cool

46
00:01:53,330 --> 00:01:55,880
? The autotrophs began to drool,
Neanderthals developed tools ?

47
00:01:55,882 --> 00:01:58,583
? We built the Wall
? <i>We built the pyramids</i> ?

48
00:01:58,585 --> 00:02:01,219
? Math, Science, History,
unraveling the mystery ?

49
00:02:01,221 --> 00:02:03,038
? That all started
with a big bang ?

50
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,614
? <i>Bang!</i> ?

53
00:02:13,642 --> 00:02:16,393
Hey, Penny and I are gonna go
shop for a dining room table.

54
00:02:16,395 --> 00:02:17,728
You want to come with us?

55
00:02:17,730 --> 00:02:19,346
You know, I'd love to,

56
00:02:19,348 --> 00:02:21,031
but, um,
I'm too busy

57
00:02:21,033 --> 00:02:25,136
falling back in love
with Windows 98.

58
00:02:26,238 --> 00:02:28,372
Seriously? You haven't used
this desk in years.

59
00:02:28,374 --> 00:02:31,759
The second I want to get rid
of it, you're up here working?

60
00:02:31,761 --> 00:02:32,943
I can't talk right now--

61
00:02:32,945 --> 00:02:36,063
I have several thousand updates
to install.

62
00:02:36,065 --> 00:02:37,982
Are you really
gonna sit here all day?

63
00:02:37,984 --> 00:02:40,234
Think of me as Arthur Dent

64
00:02:40,236 --> 00:02:42,569
in <i>Hitchhiker's Guide</i>
<i>to the Galaxy,</i>

65
00:02:42,571 --> 00:02:45,906
lying in front of the bulldozers
to protect his home.

66
00:02:45,908 --> 00:02:47,258
If you'll recall,
the Vogon fleet

67
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:49,326
blew up the Earth anyway.
It's a made-up story,

68
00:02:49,328 --> 00:02:53,047
Leonard-- I don't even know
why you're talking about it.

69
00:02:53,049 --> 00:02:54,598
I'm putting all this
stuff in storage.

70
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:56,083
We don't need
any of it.

71
00:02:56,085 --> 00:02:57,935
You... How can you say that?

72
00:02:57,937 --> 00:03:01,105
You show me one thing
in here we can live without.

73
00:03:01,107 --> 00:03:03,357
Oh, hang on.

74
00:03:06,094 --> 00:03:08,362
Check your in-box.

75
00:03:09,931 --> 00:03:12,533
Wait. Is this
really worth it?

76
00:03:12,535 --> 00:03:14,301
We've lived together

77
00:03:14,303 --> 00:03:16,487
for years with nary an argument.

78
00:03:16,489 --> 00:03:17,905
Huh?

79
00:03:17,907 --> 00:03:19,740
But we start talking
about a table,

80
00:03:19,742 --> 00:03:22,376
and suddenly we're
at each other's throats.

81
00:03:23,128 --> 00:03:25,663
"Nary an argument"?

82
00:03:26,865 --> 00:03:29,083
"Nary"?!

83
00:03:29,085 --> 00:03:32,503
Well, that means "not
one," or "not any".

84
00:03:33,638 --> 00:03:36,173
Maybe instead of a table,
you should buy a dictionary.

85
00:03:37,926 --> 00:03:40,511
Well, I don't know
if I won that,

86
00:03:40,513 --> 00:03:42,897
but at least he's upset.

87
00:03:44,065 --> 00:03:45,599
Check it out.

88
00:03:47,970 --> 00:03:49,853
Magic wand TV remote!

89
00:03:49,855 --> 00:03:52,656
Yeah, I can
control all sorts of stuff.

90
00:03:52,658 --> 00:03:54,358
Did Bernadette
think it was cool?

91
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:57,811
Not when I said "mute"
and pointed it at her face.

92
00:03:57,813 --> 00:03:59,480
Oh, uh, let me try.

93
00:03:59,482 --> 00:04:01,165
Uh...

94
00:04:01,167 --> 00:04:03,150
channelis changeroni!

95
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:08,422
This might be my second
favorite brown magic wand.

96
00:04:12,761 --> 00:04:16,864
Well, that's the last
time I play with <i>that.</i>

97
00:04:19,468 --> 00:04:21,368
I have to take this.

98
00:04:21,370 --> 00:04:23,137
Hello?

99
00:04:23,139 --> 00:04:24,138
Uh...

100
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:25,839
off.

101
00:04:25,841 --> 00:04:27,558
And on.

102
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:29,376
And the Oprah Network.

103
00:04:29,378 --> 00:04:34,315
This is so much better than
watching TV like a muggle.

104
00:04:34,317 --> 00:04:36,283
Okay. Thank you.

105
00:04:36,285 --> 00:04:38,185
We'll be in touch.

106
00:04:39,989 --> 00:04:42,189
You're not gonna
believe this.

107
00:04:42,191 --> 00:04:43,958
What's going on?

108
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:46,710
Oh. Wait.

109
00:04:46,712 --> 00:04:48,512
On!

110
00:04:48,514 --> 00:04:50,998
And off!

111
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,133
What's going on?

112
00:04:55,971 --> 00:04:58,038
That was NASA.

113
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:02,009
They want me to go
back up to the space station.

114
00:05:02,011 --> 00:05:04,561
Wow. What did
you tell them?

115
00:05:04,563 --> 00:05:06,230
I told them
I'd be honored.

116
00:05:06,232 --> 00:05:09,566
A second trip to space--
I'll miss you.

117
00:05:09,568 --> 00:05:11,585
And I'm gonna
miss you, too.

118
00:05:11,587 --> 00:05:13,037
I just want you
to know, I'm happy

119
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:14,505
to look in on Bernadette
while you're gone.

120
00:05:14,507 --> 00:05:16,140
Thank you.
And if anything were to happen

121
00:05:16,142 --> 00:05:19,226
to you, we will name
our firstborn son Howard.

122
00:05:20,228 --> 00:05:22,162
I'm just kidding.

123
00:05:22,164 --> 00:05:24,498
We'll name him Dalib,
after my grandfather.

124
00:05:26,951 --> 00:05:29,003
Ooh, this one looks nice.

125
00:05:29,005 --> 00:05:30,504
No. Sheldon doesn't like

126
00:05:30,506 --> 00:05:33,123
reclaimed wood.

127
00:05:33,125 --> 00:05:34,408
Why not?

128
00:05:34,410 --> 00:05:38,095
He's afraid the original owners
will come back.

129
00:05:38,097 --> 00:05:40,848
Yeah. Well, Sheldon's not here.

130
00:05:40,850 --> 00:05:42,766
Well, he is <i>here.</i>

131
00:05:42,768 --> 00:05:44,418
So unless you want
to dig him out

132
00:05:44,420 --> 00:05:45,969
with a bone saw
and a melon baller,

133
00:05:45,971 --> 00:05:47,855
there's nothing
I can do about it.

134
00:05:47,857 --> 00:05:49,773
All right, sweetie,
you're paying for this table,

135
00:05:49,775 --> 00:05:52,259
and it's your apartment, too.
I know, but...

136
00:05:52,261 --> 00:05:55,596
No buts. You got to stop
letting him boss you around.

137
00:05:55,598 --> 00:05:58,949
You're right. I mean, h-he
decides what TV shows we watch,

138
00:05:58,951 --> 00:06:01,402
what food we eat,
who my favorite hobbit is--

139
00:06:01,404 --> 00:06:03,770
I wanted Frodo, but we
can't <i>both</i> have Frodo,

140
00:06:03,772 --> 00:06:06,957
so guess who's stuck
with Samwise Gamgee.

141
00:06:06,959 --> 00:06:09,043
See? Right there.
You're a grown man,

142
00:06:09,045 --> 00:06:11,945
you should be able to pick
whichever hobbit you want.

143
00:06:13,281 --> 00:06:16,417
Wish you wouldn't, but
one problem at a time.

144
00:06:16,419 --> 00:06:20,054
Y-You make a lot of sense.

145
00:06:20,056 --> 00:06:22,956
I like this table,
and I'm getting it.

146
00:06:22,958 --> 00:06:25,225
Really? This one?

147
00:06:27,011 --> 00:06:28,545
That one?

148
00:06:28,547 --> 00:06:30,264
Damn right
I like that one.

149
00:06:34,487 --> 00:06:36,437
Hey.
Good news.

150
00:06:36,439 --> 00:06:40,324
Someone in this room
gets to take a ride on a rocket.

151
00:06:40,326 --> 00:06:43,560
Fine. Can I at least
shower first?

152
00:06:43,562 --> 00:06:45,079
No, not that.

153
00:06:45,081 --> 00:06:47,614
Although you already agreed
to it, so no take-backs.

154
00:06:47,616 --> 00:06:49,216
What are you
talking about?

155
00:06:49,218 --> 00:06:51,218
Sit down.

156
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:53,370
NASA called.

157
00:06:53,372 --> 00:06:56,823
The telescope mount I
installed on the space station

158
00:06:56,825 --> 00:06:58,459
got damaged,

159
00:06:58,461 --> 00:07:01,245
and they want me to go
back up and fix it.

160
00:07:02,163 --> 00:07:03,547
Wow.

161
00:07:03,549 --> 00:07:05,716
Well, what did you say?

162
00:07:05,718 --> 00:07:08,435
What do you think
I...? I said yes!

163
00:07:08,437 --> 00:07:09,586
Why do you look
surprised?

164
00:07:09,588 --> 00:07:11,271
Well, it's just,
after last time,

165
00:07:11,273 --> 00:07:13,340
I didn't think you'd
ever want to go back.

166
00:07:13,342 --> 00:07:14,391
Are you kidding?

167
00:07:14,393 --> 00:07:16,510
It was the greatest
experience of my life.

168
00:07:16,512 --> 00:07:19,730
Really? 'Cause I kind of
remember a lot of complaining

169
00:07:19,732 --> 00:07:22,116
and wishing for it
to be over.

170
00:07:22,118 --> 00:07:24,184
I think you have
me confused

171
00:07:24,186 --> 00:07:27,354
with what's gonna happen when
you get out of that shower.

172
00:07:31,376 --> 00:07:34,161
Hey, all set.
What do you think?

173
00:07:34,163 --> 00:07:35,562
There's plenty of room
for everybody,

174
00:07:35,564 --> 00:07:36,797
a view out the window.

175
00:07:36,799 --> 00:07:39,216
My spot on the couch has
a great view of a window.

176
00:07:39,218 --> 00:07:40,534
Sometimes I can see

177
00:07:40,536 --> 00:07:41,935
space battles through it.

178
00:07:41,937 --> 00:07:43,504
It's called a TV.

179
00:07:44,906 --> 00:07:47,975
Give it a chance, Sheldon;
you might actually like it.

180
00:07:48,876 --> 00:07:50,677
You're absolutely right.

181
00:07:52,814 --> 00:07:54,214
Nope.

182
00:07:56,401 --> 00:07:59,386
Well, you can't say he
didn't give it a fair shot.

183
00:07:59,388 --> 00:08:00,721
So,
when can we get rid of it?

184
00:08:01,223 --> 00:08:02,189
We're not.

185
00:08:02,191 --> 00:08:04,158
What about
the roommate agreement?

186
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,409
It specifically
states

187
00:08:05,411 --> 00:08:06,910
that any changes in furnishing

188
00:08:06,912 --> 00:08:09,279
have to be approved
by the Furnishing Committee.

189
00:08:09,281 --> 00:08:11,582
Which only sits
on alternate years.

190
00:08:11,584 --> 00:08:13,066
Yeah, and
by the way,

191
00:08:13,068 --> 00:08:14,901
it sits over there.

192
00:08:14,903 --> 00:08:16,703
Come on,
that is ridiculous.

193
00:08:16,705 --> 00:08:18,539
She's right--
a committee that important

194
00:08:18,541 --> 00:08:20,741
should meet more often.

195
00:08:20,743 --> 00:08:22,142
That's not what I'm saying.

196
00:08:22,144 --> 00:08:24,845
Oh. This is the thing
about me standing up to him

197
00:08:24,847 --> 00:08:26,580
and not letting him
run my life?

198
00:08:26,582 --> 00:08:27,798
Yes.

199
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:29,550
That.

200
00:08:29,552 --> 00:08:32,686
Okay. I think we've
found the problem here.

201
00:08:32,688 --> 00:08:34,588
It's not the table at all.

202
00:08:34,590 --> 00:08:36,006
It's you.

203
00:08:36,008 --> 00:08:37,257
Me?

204
00:08:37,259 --> 00:08:39,593
Well, it's always me--
take one for the team.

205
00:08:39,595 --> 00:08:41,328
I have
spent years

206
00:08:41,330 --> 00:08:43,614
turning this lump of clay
into an acceptable conduit

207
00:08:43,616 --> 00:08:45,082
for my will,

208
00:08:45,084 --> 00:08:47,568
and then you came along
and reshaped him,

209
00:08:47,570 --> 00:08:50,988
with your newfangled ideas
and your fancy genitals.

210
00:08:50,990 --> 00:08:54,208
Are you gonna let him
talk to me like this?

211
00:08:54,210 --> 00:08:56,493
"Fancy" sounds
like a compliment.

212
00:08:56,495 --> 00:08:58,829
Okay, I have not tried
to change Leonard.

213
00:08:58,831 --> 00:09:00,581
That's just what happens
in relationships.

214
00:09:00,583 --> 00:09:02,633
Look how much
Amy's changed you.

215
00:09:02,635 --> 00:09:04,518
That's not true.
Oh, please.

216
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:06,553
When I first met you,
you were incapable

217
00:09:06,555 --> 00:09:08,088
of touching another human being.

218
00:09:08,090 --> 00:09:09,840
Now you're holding
hands, you're going

219
00:09:09,842 --> 00:09:12,759
on dates, you even
made out with her on a train.

220
00:09:12,761 --> 00:09:14,645
She told you?!

221
00:09:14,647 --> 00:09:16,680
Of course she told me-- it's
the most interesting thing

222
00:09:16,682 --> 00:09:18,815
that's ever happened to
her in her entire life!

223
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:21,151
You're too close to it,

224
00:09:21,153 --> 00:09:23,803
but Amy has had
a huge impact on you.

225
00:09:24,656 --> 00:09:26,173
You're right.

226
00:09:26,175 --> 00:09:28,992
Without realizing it,
I've allowed that woman

227
00:09:28,994 --> 00:09:30,978
to alter my personality.

228
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:32,979
Mm, Sheldon, you didn't
have a personality;

229
00:09:32,981 --> 00:09:36,984
you just had some shows
you liked.

230
00:09:36,986 --> 00:09:38,552
No.

231
00:09:38,554 --> 00:09:40,254
No, I've changed.

232
00:09:40,256 --> 00:09:42,873
Like the frog who's put
in a pot of water

233
00:09:42,875 --> 00:09:44,491
that's heated so gradually

234
00:09:44,493 --> 00:09:46,043
he doesn't realize
he's boiling to death.

235
00:09:46,045 --> 00:09:48,662
Or you're the frog who's
been kissed by a princess

236
00:09:48,664 --> 00:09:50,264
and turned into
a prince.

237
00:09:50,266 --> 00:09:53,133
Or you're just
a tall, annoying frog.

238
00:09:53,135 --> 00:09:54,718
Excuse me.

239
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:57,371
I have to break up
with my girlfriend.

240
00:09:57,373 --> 00:09:59,189
Oh, Sheldon, wait.
No.

241
00:09:59,191 --> 00:10:01,608
You've opened my eyes
to the truth.

242
00:10:01,610 --> 00:10:04,344
Amy has made me
a more affectionate,

243
00:10:04,346 --> 00:10:06,113
open-minded person.

244
00:10:06,115 --> 00:10:08,448
And that stops now.

245
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:14,187
Well, we should call her.
Yeah, mm-hmm.

246
00:10:15,708 --> 00:10:17,207
Amy, it's Penny. Hey.

247
00:10:17,209 --> 00:10:18,575
Just a little heads-up.

248
00:10:18,577 --> 00:10:21,211
Leonard bought a
dining room table.

249
00:10:21,213 --> 00:10:23,630
Yeah. Sheldon's
breaking up with you.

250
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:31,074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

251
00:10:32,179 --> 00:10:35,365
Amy? Amy?

252
00:10:35,367 --> 00:10:36,983
Amy?

253
00:10:36,985 --> 00:10:39,018
I'll get right
to the point.

254
00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:40,286
I think we need

255
00:10:40,288 --> 00:10:42,605
to end this
relationship-- so...

256
00:10:42,607 --> 00:10:43,873
just sign this

257
00:10:43,875 --> 00:10:45,308
with your finger, and, uh,

258
00:10:45,310 --> 00:10:47,360
please don't cry on my iPad--

259
00:10:47,362 --> 00:10:49,746
I didn't get AppleCare.

260
00:10:49,748 --> 00:10:52,632
I'm not surprised you want
to end the relationship.

261
00:10:52,634 --> 00:10:55,802
I'm a little surprised
you didn't get AppleCare.

262
00:10:57,037 --> 00:10:59,455
Anyway, enjoy your life.
Where do I sign?

263
00:10:59,457 --> 00:11:00,924
At the bottom.
I must say,

264
00:11:00,926 --> 00:11:03,409
I'm relieved you're not making
more of a scene out of this.

265
00:11:03,411 --> 00:11:05,311
Oh, I've already moved on.

266
00:11:05,313 --> 00:11:07,497
Besides, this breakup has
nothing to do with me.

267
00:11:07,499 --> 00:11:09,515
Wh... It doesn't?

268
00:11:09,517 --> 00:11:11,434
Of course not.
This is just Leonard

269
00:11:11,436 --> 00:11:14,270
trying to take the focus
off that dreadful table

270
00:11:14,272 --> 00:11:16,055
by sowing discord
in our relationship.

271
00:11:16,057 --> 00:11:18,608
He's manipulating you
like he always does.

272
00:11:18,610 --> 00:11:21,661
Wait-wait, now, hang on.

273
00:11:21,663 --> 00:11:24,030
You think he manipulates me?

274
00:11:24,032 --> 00:11:25,315
All the time.

275
00:11:25,317 --> 00:11:26,916
And he knew that,

276
00:11:26,918 --> 00:11:29,235
as your girlfriend,
I wasn't gonna stand by

277
00:11:29,237 --> 00:11:31,921
and let him bring a table
into your apartment.

278
00:11:31,923 --> 00:11:34,340
I mean, a table?
Come on!

279
00:11:35,793 --> 00:11:39,262
It is hideous.

280
00:11:39,264 --> 00:11:40,763
Well, thankfully,
I won't have to see it,

281
00:11:40,765 --> 00:11:42,405
'cause I won't be your
girlfriend anymore.

282
00:11:43,884 --> 00:11:45,351
Amy Farrah Fowler.

283
00:11:45,353 --> 00:11:48,638
Why, yes, I <i>would</i> like
to take a survey.

284
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:50,356
Wait.

285
00:11:51,558 --> 00:11:53,059
You were really
gonna stand by me

286
00:11:53,061 --> 00:11:54,477
against the dining room table?

287
00:11:55,396 --> 00:11:57,613
Of course I was.

288
00:11:57,615 --> 00:11:59,265
Yeah, wait.

289
00:11:59,267 --> 00:12:03,136
How do I know that <i>you're</i>
not manipulating me right now?

290
00:12:03,138 --> 00:12:05,938
I think if I were
manipulating you,

291
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:08,992
you'd be smart
enough to see it.

292
00:12:08,994 --> 00:12:11,127
How do I know
you're not saying <i>that</i>

293
00:12:11,129 --> 00:12:13,830
as part of the manipulation?

294
00:12:13,832 --> 00:12:17,333
I think you'd be smart
enough to see that, too.

295
00:12:18,702 --> 00:12:20,169
Okay.

296
00:12:21,455 --> 00:12:24,924
I'm sorry I gave you such a hard time--
I just had to be sure.

297
00:12:27,411 --> 00:12:28,628
It's pretty exciting

298
00:12:28,630 --> 00:12:30,963
that NASA wants
to send Howard back up.

299
00:12:30,965 --> 00:12:32,899
Yeah, exciting.

300
00:12:32,901 --> 00:12:35,018
Can I ask you something?

301
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:36,269
Course.

302
00:12:36,271 --> 00:12:38,104
He hated that
entire experience.

303
00:12:38,106 --> 00:12:39,689
Does it make me
an awful wife

304
00:12:39,691 --> 00:12:41,824
if I don't think he
should do it again?

305
00:12:41,826 --> 00:12:42,975
Not at all.

306
00:12:42,977 --> 00:12:44,911
He's forgotten
how miserable he was

307
00:12:44,913 --> 00:12:46,662
the entire time he was up there.

308
00:12:46,664 --> 00:12:48,247
It's like me

309
00:12:48,249 --> 00:12:50,566
in those moments
when I miss India.

310
00:12:50,568 --> 00:12:52,418
So you'll talk to him?

311
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:53,423
Why me?

312
00:12:53,448 --> 00:12:55,586
Well, I'm his wife;
I don't want to ruin it for him.

313
00:12:55,623 --> 00:12:58,758
That's the dynamic-- I'm the
fun one, you're the buzzkill.

314
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:00,960
Since when am I the buzzkill?

315
00:13:00,962 --> 00:13:02,712
Do you think this is cool?

316
00:13:02,714 --> 00:13:04,547
No, I think it's stupid.
Aha!

317
00:13:06,483 --> 00:13:08,818
You're right, it's great.

318
00:13:13,024 --> 00:13:14,540
Hello.
Oh, hey.

319
00:13:14,542 --> 00:13:16,159
You guys didn't break up.

320
00:13:16,161 --> 00:13:18,277
No. Sorry to disappoint you,

321
00:13:18,279 --> 00:13:20,029
but Amy pointed out that

322
00:13:20,031 --> 00:13:21,981
you we only trying
to manipulate me.

323
00:13:21,983 --> 00:13:23,232
Which you also
figured out by yourself.

324
00:13:23,234 --> 00:13:25,684
Which I also
figured out by myself.

325
00:13:26,570 --> 00:13:28,704
Well, I'm glad
you're still together.

326
00:13:28,706 --> 00:13:30,189
Yeah, okay,
you can stop trying

327
00:13:30,191 --> 00:13:31,574
to make this about
our relationship.

328
00:13:31,576 --> 00:13:34,460
Which is stronger than ever.
Which is stronger than ever.

329
00:13:35,195 --> 00:13:36,329
This is about <i>you</i>

330
00:13:36,331 --> 00:13:38,047
trying to change
my environment,

331
00:13:38,049 --> 00:13:40,133
which was perfect
the way it was.

332
00:13:40,135 --> 00:13:42,802
But it got the way it was
through change.

333
00:13:42,804 --> 00:13:44,670
The-the spot
that you love to sit in,

334
00:13:44,672 --> 00:13:47,974
that no one else can sit in,
only exists because--

335
00:13:47,976 --> 00:13:51,177
despite your objections--
I bought this couch.

336
00:13:51,179 --> 00:13:52,311
Me.

337
00:13:52,313 --> 00:13:54,313
So explain
why that change was bad

338
00:13:54,315 --> 00:13:56,182
and this change was good.

339
00:13:57,985 --> 00:13:59,852
Um...

340
00:13:59,854 --> 00:14:02,188
You don't need to
explain yourself to him.

341
00:14:02,190 --> 00:14:05,324
I don't need to explain
myself to you!

342
00:14:05,326 --> 00:14:08,027
You're sick of his nonsense
and ready to move in with me.

343
00:14:08,029 --> 00:14:10,113
Keep the table!
We don't use that space!

344
00:14:16,069 --> 00:14:18,287
Damn it, I got cocky.

345
00:14:20,674 --> 00:14:23,359
Hey, Bernie.
I'm home... Hello.

346
00:14:23,361 --> 00:14:24,743
Hi, honey.

347
00:14:24,745 --> 00:14:26,078
What's going on?

348
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:28,331
Maybe you should
have a seat.

349
00:14:28,333 --> 00:14:30,249
Um... okay.

350
00:14:30,251 --> 00:14:33,302
I know my mom's not dead;
there'd be balloons.

351
00:14:34,388 --> 00:14:35,921
Um... okay. First off,

352
00:14:35,923 --> 00:14:39,142
know that we all love you
and cherish you.

353
00:14:39,144 --> 00:14:41,494
Well, I wouldn't...
Daddy.

354
00:14:41,496 --> 00:14:43,980
You're great.

355
00:14:44,948 --> 00:14:48,117
Can I say something?
Oh, of course.

356
00:14:50,020 --> 00:14:51,787
Hey, Fruit Loops.

357
00:14:51,789 --> 00:14:54,490
Massimino?
Why are <i>you</i> here?

358
00:14:54,492 --> 00:14:55,725
Well, I heard you were thinking

359
00:14:55,727 --> 00:14:57,460
about going back up
to the space station,

360
00:14:57,462 --> 00:14:59,629
and as someone
who's been there with you...

361
00:14:59,631 --> 00:15:02,498
well, you know how astronauts
need to have the "right stuff"?

362
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:03,583
Sure.

363
00:15:03,585 --> 00:15:06,085
The stuff you have is wrong.

364
00:15:09,072 --> 00:15:12,108
You don't think
I did a good job up there?

365
00:15:12,110 --> 00:15:13,559
You did a fine job.

366
00:15:13,561 --> 00:15:16,412
It's just, you were scared
and miserable the whole time.

367
00:15:16,414 --> 00:15:17,713
I think what

368
00:15:17,715 --> 00:15:19,899
we're all trying to say
is, you don't seem

369
00:15:19,901 --> 00:15:22,552
to be remembering how traumatic
the experience was for you.

370
00:15:22,554 --> 00:15:25,905
Like how women often forget
the pain of childbirth.

371
00:15:25,907 --> 00:15:28,641
Like a woman.
Great analogy.

372
00:15:29,443 --> 00:15:32,445
Fine, maybe I was
a little scared.

373
00:15:32,447 --> 00:15:35,031
You peed in your space suit.

374
00:15:35,033 --> 00:15:36,766
You're supposed to do that.

375
00:15:36,768 --> 00:15:38,935
Not during the fitting.

376
00:15:40,070 --> 00:15:43,172
Son, do I need to remind you
what you asked me to do

377
00:15:43,174 --> 00:15:44,840
before you went
up last time?

378
00:15:44,842 --> 00:15:48,010
Hang on. That was
just me joking around.

379
00:15:48,012 --> 00:15:51,080
You wanted me to shoot you
in the foot.

380
00:15:51,082 --> 00:15:54,350
Come on, how is that not a joke?
"You got to get me out of this.

381
00:15:54,352 --> 00:15:56,385
Shoot me in the foot."

382
00:15:57,804 --> 00:16:00,590
Don't forget all the other
astronauts picking on you.

383
00:16:00,592 --> 00:16:02,391
And how you threw up
in zero gravity,

384
00:16:02,393 --> 00:16:04,610
and it floated
back in your mouth.

385
00:16:05,512 --> 00:16:06,896
And you threw up again.

386
00:16:06,898 --> 00:16:08,664
And so on and so on.

387
00:16:11,001 --> 00:16:13,035
That was funny.

388
00:16:13,037 --> 00:16:14,186
Okay, so I wasn't

389
00:16:14,188 --> 00:16:17,123
exactly John Glenn up there,

390
00:16:17,125 --> 00:16:19,825
but I've changed;
I'm a different man now.

391
00:16:19,827 --> 00:16:21,193
Yeah, and I'm
a little

392
00:16:21,195 --> 00:16:24,580
insulted that you guys
don't think I can handle it.

393
00:16:24,582 --> 00:16:27,216
You know you're gonna have to go
through survival training again.

394
00:16:27,218 --> 00:16:28,534
Really?

395
00:16:28,536 --> 00:16:30,920
You've got to get me
out of this!

396
00:16:30,922 --> 00:16:33,422
What do you want me to do?
You're perfectly healthy.

397
00:16:33,424 --> 00:16:35,224
Check my blood pressure again!

398
00:16:35,226 --> 00:16:38,728
I can get it higher;
just give me a second.

399
00:16:39,763 --> 00:16:42,381
Hello?
Hi, Ma. How are you?

400
00:16:43,216 --> 00:16:44,717
How I am is not dead!

401
00:16:44,719 --> 00:16:47,403
But you wouldn't know that,
because you don't love me enough

402
00:16:47,405 --> 00:16:48,738
to pick up the phone!

403
00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:51,223
Go, go, go!

404
00:16:51,225 --> 00:16:55,027
For all you know, I could have
slipped in the tub and drowned!

405
00:16:55,029 --> 00:16:57,563
That's what happened
to your Aunt Ida!

406
00:16:58,415 --> 00:17:00,232
Wow.

407
00:17:09,290 --> 00:17:11,925
Howard, I'm so sorry your
blood pressure was off the charts.

408
00:17:11,927 --> 00:17:14,427
Oh, me, too.
I mean, the doctor was willing

409
00:17:14,429 --> 00:17:16,129
to fudge the results, but...

410
00:17:16,131 --> 00:17:19,065
it just seemed
so darned dishonest.

411
00:17:21,519 --> 00:17:23,570
But the mission wouldn't be
for at least a year.

412
00:17:23,572 --> 00:17:25,605
Isn't that enough time to get
your blood pressure under...

413
00:17:25,607 --> 00:17:28,191
Look, my blood pressure's
too high, okay? Drop it.

414
00:17:29,176 --> 00:17:30,510
You know, my aunt

415
00:17:30,512 --> 00:17:32,329
changed her diet,
and in a few months, she...

416
00:17:32,331 --> 00:17:33,480
Went to space?

417
00:17:33,482 --> 00:17:35,282
I don't think so.
Now, pass the soy sauce.

418
00:17:35,284 --> 00:17:37,150
Hey, not the green one;
the red one.

419
00:17:38,119 --> 00:17:41,187
Sheldon, Amy, will you
please come join us?

420
00:17:41,189 --> 00:17:42,973
Yeah, it's
fun up here.

421
00:17:42,975 --> 00:17:45,392
So why are you
trying to ruin it?

422
00:17:45,394 --> 00:17:47,410
No, thanks.

423
00:17:47,412 --> 00:17:49,429
We're fine.
I mean, if you people

424
00:17:49,431 --> 00:17:52,766
want to eat at the table,
then that's what you should do.

425
00:17:52,768 --> 00:17:54,284
I like eating down here

426
00:17:54,286 --> 00:17:56,753
because this is how
we've always done things.

427
00:17:56,755 --> 00:17:59,139
But if those days are
gone, they're gone.

428
00:17:59,141 --> 00:18:02,359
It just...
makes me sad.

429
00:18:03,778 --> 00:18:05,328
Now I feel bad.

430
00:18:05,330 --> 00:18:07,781
Oh, don't anthropomorphize him;
he's got big eyes,

431
00:18:07,783 --> 00:18:11,484
but his feelings
are not like ours.

432
00:18:12,570 --> 00:18:15,755
No, it just seems silly
for us to sit in two groups.

433
00:18:15,757 --> 00:18:17,791
Well, it's not silly
if you think of that group

434
00:18:17,793 --> 00:18:20,377
as being led
by a big, evil baby.

435
00:18:24,882 --> 00:18:26,966
Look at Amy
down there.

436
00:18:26,968 --> 00:18:29,019
Should we go?

437
00:18:29,021 --> 00:18:30,737
Yeah, let's go.

438
00:18:30,739 --> 00:18:32,972
But... Penny,
this was your idea.

439
00:18:32,974 --> 00:18:34,774
You said that I should
stand up to him.

440
00:18:34,776 --> 00:18:36,059
Forget it, Leonard.

441
00:18:36,061 --> 00:18:37,894
It's over.

442
00:18:38,763 --> 00:18:40,213
Fine.

443
00:18:45,719 --> 00:18:47,187
Rajesh?

444
00:18:47,189 --> 00:18:50,156
Screw that! I sat
on the floor for seven years.

445
00:18:50,158 --> 00:18:52,308
I'm staying right here!

446
00:18:52,310 --> 00:18:55,195
Come on, Raj, it's
not the same without you.

447
00:18:56,398 --> 00:18:58,865
Fine.

448
00:18:58,867 --> 00:19:01,901
But no more making fun
of how I say tings.

449
00:19:01,903 --> 00:19:05,372
You mean "tings"
like "moo-stache"?

450
00:19:11,128 --> 00:19:13,746
Well, isn't this nice.

451
00:19:15,387 --> 00:19:16,945
Sometimes the baby wins.

452
