1
00:00:01,394 --> 00:00:03,295
The math is all there.

2
00:00:03,297 --> 00:00:05,313
It's not real.
Yes, it is.

3
00:00:05,315 --> 00:00:08,550
Yeah... uh, look.
It is scientifically impossible

4
00:00:08,552 --> 00:00:10,735
for a person to tip a cow.

5
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:13,355
Even you, with your stocky build

6
00:00:13,357 --> 00:00:15,557
and lumberjack shoulders,
you couldn't do it.

7
00:00:16,725 --> 00:00:18,226
It's horrible. Why would
you push a cow over?

8
00:00:18,228 --> 00:00:19,194
They're sacred.

9
00:00:19,196 --> 00:00:20,445
Oh, stop it.

10
00:00:20,447 --> 00:00:22,414
I've seen you eat,
like, a million hamburgers.

11
00:00:22,416 --> 00:00:25,500
Hey, an animal can be both
sacred and delicious.

12
00:00:26,586 --> 00:00:28,169
Look, I'm telling you
I've done it, okay?

13
00:00:28,171 --> 00:00:29,904
I clearly remember
the cow standing up

14
00:00:29,906 --> 00:00:31,456
and then the cow on its side.

15
00:00:31,458 --> 00:00:33,375
Were you drunk?

16
00:00:33,377 --> 00:00:36,911
I was 16 in Nebraska.
What do you think?

17
00:00:36,913 --> 00:00:39,848
I think <i>you're</i> the one
who fell over.

18
00:00:39,850 --> 00:00:44,469
That would explain why the sky
was also on its side.

19
00:00:44,471 --> 00:00:45,637
Hey.

20
00:00:45,639 --> 00:00:48,089
Howard. Cow tipping:
real or not?

21
00:00:48,091 --> 00:00:50,475
Mmm. I'm gonna say... not.

22
00:00:50,477 --> 00:00:52,561
That's just based on me
trying to roll

23
00:00:52,563 --> 00:00:54,696
my mom over
when she's snoring.

24
00:00:55,898 --> 00:00:58,900
Speaking of that big
side of beef,

25
00:00:58,902 --> 00:01:02,203
uh, she's invited all of you
to Thanksgiving at her house.

26
00:01:02,205 --> 00:01:03,271
Aw.

27
00:01:03,273 --> 00:01:05,206
Mmm.

28
00:01:05,208 --> 00:01:07,125
You know, I've been told
that a bald refusal

29
00:01:07,127 --> 00:01:09,461
of an invitation is rude
and one must instead

30
00:01:09,463 --> 00:01:11,246
offer up a polite excuse, so...

31
00:01:11,248 --> 00:01:13,715
I'd love to go,
but, unfortunately,

32
00:01:13,717 --> 00:01:15,584
that sounds awful.

33
00:01:19,071 --> 00:01:21,039
Come on, it'll be fun.

34
00:01:21,041 --> 00:01:22,390
Uh, we were actually
gonna do it here.

35
00:01:22,392 --> 00:01:24,142
Please? Bernadette's
bringing her dad

36
00:01:24,144 --> 00:01:25,260
'cause her mom's out of town,

37
00:01:25,262 --> 00:01:27,395
and I never have anything
to say to that guy.

38
00:01:27,397 --> 00:01:29,797
Oh, since you put it that way,
I'd love to go,

39
00:01:29,799 --> 00:01:31,483
but that sounds even more awful.

40
00:01:32,468 --> 00:01:33,969
It'd actually be nice
to not hear

41
00:01:33,971 --> 00:01:35,737
Sheldon complain
about <i>my</i> cooking all day.

42
00:01:35,739 --> 00:01:37,155
Yo... uh,
excuse me,

43
00:01:37,157 --> 00:01:40,025
but every year
you prepare a terrible meal

44
00:01:40,027 --> 00:01:42,160
and every year I criticize it.

45
00:01:42,162 --> 00:01:44,479
Do our traditions
mean nothing to you?

46
00:01:46,649 --> 00:01:48,199
I want to go.
Yeah, me, too.

47
00:01:48,201 --> 00:01:49,584
I'm in.
Sheldon.

48
00:01:49,586 --> 00:01:52,037
Ugh, fine,
I'll go.

49
00:01:52,039 --> 00:01:54,489
But if her food is delicious,
Thanksgiving is ruined,

50
00:01:54,491 --> 00:01:55,657
and it's on you.

51
00:01:57,376 --> 00:02:01,012
? Our whole universe
was in a hot, dense state ?

52
00:02:01,014 --> 00:02:04,349
? Then nearly 14 billion years
ago expansion started... Wait! ?

53
00:02:04,351 --> 00:02:06,000
? The Earth began to cool

54
00:02:06,002 --> 00:02:08,536
? The autotrophs began to drool,
Neanderthals developed tools ?

55
00:02:08,538 --> 00:02:11,189
? We built the Wall
? <i>We built the pyramids</i> ?

56
00:02:11,191 --> 00:02:13,875
? Math, Science, History,
unraveling the mystery ?

57
00:02:13,877 --> 00:02:15,777
? That all started
with a big bang ?

58
00:02:15,779 --> 00:02:17,746
? <i>Bang!</i> ?

61
00:02:27,158 --> 00:02:29,613
Do we really have to go
to Mrs. Wolowitz's house?

62
00:02:30,161 --> 00:02:31,495
We do.

63
00:02:31,497 --> 00:02:34,314
And I expect you
to be on your best behavior.

64
00:02:34,316 --> 00:02:37,534
Now I know how the
African slaves felt.

65
00:02:39,137 --> 00:02:40,721
Being dragged
from their homes

66
00:02:40,723 --> 00:02:44,124
to labor under the
yoke of the white man.

67
00:02:44,126 --> 00:02:47,294
Are you honestly comparing
Thanksgiving dinner

68
00:02:47,296 --> 00:02:50,047
at Wolowitz's mom's with
one of the greatest tragedies

69
00:02:50,049 --> 00:02:51,765
in the history of mankind?

70
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:54,835
Yes.

71
00:02:54,837 --> 00:02:56,887
Sheldon, you can have
a nice Thanksgiving anywhere.

72
00:02:56,889 --> 00:02:58,355
I spent one in Vegas.

73
00:02:58,357 --> 00:02:59,339
You did?

74
00:02:59,341 --> 00:03:01,341
Yeah, back when
I was dating Zack.

75
00:03:01,343 --> 00:03:02,976
It was actually more fun
than I thought.

76
00:03:02,978 --> 00:03:05,529
We gambled, we went to one
of those cheesy wedding chapels,

77
00:03:05,531 --> 00:03:07,147
we had a really good
turkey dinner.

78
00:03:07,149 --> 00:03:10,350
Which was surprising,
since we were at a strip club.

79
00:03:11,686 --> 00:03:13,203
Wait, you went
to a chapel?

80
00:03:13,205 --> 00:03:14,571
Yeah.
Why?

81
00:03:14,573 --> 00:03:17,524
We had one of those
silly fake weddings.

82
00:03:21,279 --> 00:03:22,512
Penny...

83
00:03:22,514 --> 00:03:24,731
you know those are real, right?

84
00:03:24,733 --> 00:03:27,217
No, they're not.

85
00:03:28,169 --> 00:03:29,369
Yeah, they are.

86
00:03:30,905 --> 00:03:32,422
No, they're not.

87
00:03:32,424 --> 00:03:34,040
Yeah, they are.

88
00:03:34,042 --> 00:03:35,709
He's right.
They're real.

89
00:03:37,228 --> 00:03:40,314
But it... didn't seem real.

90
00:03:41,265 --> 00:03:42,649
Let me ask you
a question.

91
00:03:42,651 --> 00:03:47,988
At any point, was
Las Vegas on its side?

92
00:03:51,009 --> 00:03:52,693
Hi, Dad.

93
00:03:52,695 --> 00:03:54,027
Hi, honey.

94
00:03:55,363 --> 00:03:57,331
Oh, you brought beer
for everybody.

95
00:03:57,333 --> 00:04:00,834
Uh, okay, yeah,
it's for everybody.

96
00:04:03,788 --> 00:04:06,490
I really just wanted to have
a nice, quiet day at home

97
00:04:06,492 --> 00:04:07,858
and watch the game.

98
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:10,293
You can have a quiet day
and watch the game here.

99
00:04:10,295 --> 00:04:13,797
Howard,
the medicine's not working!

100
00:04:14,882 --> 00:04:16,867
You just took it.

101
00:04:16,869 --> 00:04:19,369
At least let it
reach your first stomach!

102
00:04:23,591 --> 00:04:25,192
Hey, Mike.

103
00:04:25,194 --> 00:04:26,393
Let me help you out, there.

104
00:04:26,395 --> 00:04:28,528
Thanks. What's wrong
with your mom?

105
00:04:28,530 --> 00:04:29,896
Oh, her gout's flaring up.

106
00:04:29,898 --> 00:04:33,033
Turns out an apple pie a day
does not keep the doctor away.

107
00:04:34,569 --> 00:04:36,703
How can one little toe
hurt so bad?

108
00:04:38,106 --> 00:04:42,959
Maybe because that little piggy
is being crushed by the barn!

109
00:04:44,128 --> 00:04:46,213
She should
quiet down soon.

110
00:04:46,215 --> 00:04:49,216
I gave her enough pain meds
to choke a... well, her.

111
00:04:51,719 --> 00:04:53,704
I guess we're gonna
have to do all the cooking.

112
00:04:53,706 --> 00:04:54,888
I have a better idea.

113
00:04:54,890 --> 00:04:56,223
If you think you're
gonna make me

114
00:04:56,225 --> 00:04:57,641
do all this by myself,
you're crazy.

115
00:04:57,643 --> 00:04:59,509
I was gonna make Raj
do it all by himself.

116
00:04:59,511 --> 00:05:00,960
Oh, well, that's
a great idea.

117
00:05:03,815 --> 00:05:05,982
No traffic,
we're sailing.

118
00:05:05,984 --> 00:05:07,100
Yes.

119
00:05:07,102 --> 00:05:08,935
Like we're on a ship.

120
00:05:10,238 --> 00:05:12,656
Coming from Africa to America.

121
00:05:14,942 --> 00:05:17,611
Sheldon, that's
completely inappropriate.

122
00:05:17,613 --> 00:05:20,480
You can't keep comparing
yourself to a slave.

123
00:05:21,666 --> 00:05:23,166
Yes, Miss Amy.

124
00:05:26,287 --> 00:05:28,171
I can't believe you're
married to that idiot.

125
00:05:28,173 --> 00:05:30,657
Ugh, would you stop?
We just did it as a goof.

126
00:05:30,659 --> 00:05:32,209
Well, a goof or not,
you're actually married.

127
00:05:32,211 --> 00:05:34,010
You need to get
this taken care of.

128
00:05:34,012 --> 00:05:36,463
I will. Why are you
making this such a big deal?

129
00:05:36,465 --> 00:05:38,598
Oh, oh, oh, I have a reason.

130
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:41,518
It could be because
you said yes to marrying Zack,

131
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,136
but every time
Leonard's proposed,

132
00:05:43,138 --> 00:05:44,638
he's gotten a resounding no.

133
00:05:46,691 --> 00:05:49,810
Yeah, that's just
off the top of my head.

134
00:05:49,812 --> 00:05:51,645
So how do I undo this?

135
00:05:51,647 --> 00:05:53,146
I'm hoping you can
get an annulment.

136
00:05:53,148 --> 00:05:54,698
It's just like
it never happened.

137
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:56,399
Great, well, what
do I have to do?

138
00:05:56,401 --> 00:05:58,068
It says here you can
get an annulment

139
00:05:58,070 --> 00:05:59,870
if any of the following
conditions are met.

140
00:05:59,872 --> 00:06:01,872
"Were you unable
to consummate the marriage?"

141
00:06:01,874 --> 00:06:03,824
Penny? Next.

142
00:06:05,693 --> 00:06:08,328
"Is there any evidence
of fraud, bigamy,

143
00:06:08,330 --> 00:06:09,913
want of understanding?"

144
00:06:09,915 --> 00:06:10,964
"Want of understanding?"

145
00:06:10,966 --> 00:06:11,998
What does that even mean?

146
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,034
Ding, ding, ding.
We have a winner.

147
00:06:16,203 --> 00:06:17,754
Thanks for saving the day.

148
00:06:17,756 --> 00:06:18,872
Ah, no problem.

149
00:06:18,874 --> 00:06:20,039
It wouldn't be Thanksgiving

150
00:06:20,041 --> 00:06:23,209
without an Indian
providing the food.

151
00:06:24,846 --> 00:06:27,213
Uh, now, where does your mom
keep the Crisco?

152
00:06:27,215 --> 00:06:28,348
Um, I don't know.

153
00:06:28,350 --> 00:06:30,183
Probably in a wad in her cheek.

154
00:06:31,853 --> 00:06:34,604
I'll help Raj in here. Why don't
you go keep my dad company?

155
00:06:34,606 --> 00:06:37,073
Oh, he doesn't want me in there.
I'm the creepy little guy

156
00:06:37,075 --> 00:06:39,392
who has sex with his daughter.

157
00:06:41,546 --> 00:06:43,997
Don't be silly, he loves you.
Does he?

158
00:06:43,999 --> 00:06:46,533
Okay, he cares about you a lot.
Really?

159
00:06:46,535 --> 00:06:49,619
I do crap for you
all the time. Get out there.

160
00:06:55,243 --> 00:06:59,045
So your wife's in Arizona
with the grandkids?

161
00:06:59,047 --> 00:07:00,714
Uh-huh.

162
00:07:02,967 --> 00:07:05,251
- You know, my mom's been to...
-  Arizona.

163
00:07:05,253 --> 00:07:07,938
She rode one of those mules
down in the Grand Canyon.

164
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:10,607
Long story short,
they had to shoot it.

165
00:07:15,196 --> 00:07:17,096
'Cause she's so fat.

166
00:07:21,570 --> 00:07:24,037
I'll get the door
while you finish laughing.

167
00:07:27,325 --> 00:07:28,825
Hey, guys.

168
00:07:28,827 --> 00:07:29,826
Happy Thanksgiving.

169
00:07:29,828 --> 00:07:31,411
It smells wonderful.

170
00:07:31,413 --> 00:07:33,663
Is anyone slaving away
in the kitchen?

171
00:07:33,665 --> 00:07:35,114
Because I, too, know...
Sheldon.

172
00:07:37,418 --> 00:07:39,252
Here. Thank you for having us.

173
00:07:39,254 --> 00:07:40,286
What's with you?

174
00:07:40,288 --> 00:07:41,471
Oh, she's mad at <i>me</i>

175
00:07:41,473 --> 00:07:43,840
because she just found out
she's married to Zack.

176
00:07:43,842 --> 00:07:44,841
Really?

177
00:07:44,843 --> 00:07:46,810
That dumb-ass
she used to date?

178
00:07:46,812 --> 00:07:49,429
That's hysterical.

179
00:07:49,431 --> 00:07:52,933
I can't believe I felt bad
for opening this in the car.

180
00:07:58,189 --> 00:07:59,940
You need any help?

181
00:07:59,942 --> 00:08:02,609
Uh, yeah, can you, uh, reach
that, uh, gravy boat up there?

182
00:08:02,611 --> 00:08:03,977
Uh, sure.
Great.

183
00:08:03,979 --> 00:08:06,246
That makes one of you.

184
00:08:07,698 --> 00:08:10,984
Okay, we have a lot to do
and not much time to do it.

185
00:08:10,986 --> 00:08:13,587
Bernadette, you're on corn,
gravy and yam detail.

186
00:08:13,589 --> 00:08:14,988
Amy, you're on
rolls, cranberries

187
00:08:14,990 --> 00:08:17,350
and making sure Bernadette stays
away from the marshmallows.

188
00:08:18,542 --> 00:08:20,961
That's right, I see you.

189
00:08:22,179 --> 00:08:23,780
Okay, if you have
any questions,

190
00:08:23,782 --> 00:08:25,482
I'll be over here
basting my ass off.

191
00:08:25,484 --> 00:08:27,550
Focus is key.

192
00:08:27,552 --> 00:08:30,220
Did you guys know Penny
married Zack three years ago?

193
00:08:30,222 --> 00:08:32,022
What?
Wha...?

194
00:08:37,511 --> 00:08:39,012
You ever play football?

195
00:08:39,014 --> 00:08:40,614
A little in college.

196
00:08:40,616 --> 00:08:41,648
You?

197
00:08:41,650 --> 00:08:42,782
No.

198
00:08:42,784 --> 00:08:45,452
But I did get tackled
in the hallway once.

199
00:08:47,289 --> 00:08:50,156
The whole school cheered.

200
00:08:52,827 --> 00:08:54,210
Hey, I found the,
uh, court papers

201
00:08:54,212 --> 00:08:55,695
that you and Zack
need to fill out.

202
00:08:55,697 --> 00:08:57,414
I'll print them when we get home.
Fine.

203
00:08:57,416 --> 00:08:59,699
And we can just put this
whole thing behind us.

204
00:08:59,701 --> 00:09:00,667
Are you done?

205
00:09:00,669 --> 00:09:02,469
What?
Look, I get it, I screwed up.

206
00:09:02,471 --> 00:09:04,170
Is this all we're gonna talk
about the rest of the day?

207
00:09:04,172 --> 00:09:05,422
Why are you mad at me?

208
00:09:05,424 --> 00:09:07,090
You're the one that
did the stupid thing.

209
00:09:07,092 --> 00:09:08,725
I'm just trying to fix it.
Ugh!

210
00:09:08,727 --> 00:09:10,126
I need some air.

211
00:09:10,128 --> 00:09:11,678
Well... Penny.

212
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:13,546
Now, I don't know the
first thing about women,

213
00:09:13,548 --> 00:09:15,382
but I would not follow her.

214
00:09:18,352 --> 00:09:20,570
Listen to Stretch.

215
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:28,074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

216
00:09:29,631 --> 00:09:31,716
How am I
the bad guy?

217
00:09:31,718 --> 00:09:34,485
She's the one who married
someone else. I'm the victim.

218
00:09:34,487 --> 00:09:38,239
Sounds like Zack's the victim.
You're sleeping with his wife.

219
00:09:40,192 --> 00:09:43,327
I've kept my marriage
together for 35 years.

220
00:09:43,329 --> 00:09:44,812
Can I weigh in here?

221
00:09:44,814 --> 00:09:45,913
Sure.

222
00:09:45,915 --> 00:09:47,981
I'm trying to watch the game.
Shut up.

223
00:09:49,484 --> 00:09:51,018
Oh!

224
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:54,021
How do you not make
a first down there?

225
00:09:54,023 --> 00:09:55,790
They passed against
a nickel defense.

226
00:09:55,792 --> 00:09:57,558
They should have run it
off-tackle.

227
00:10:00,295 --> 00:10:02,196
How the hell
do you know that?

228
00:10:02,198 --> 00:10:03,831
My father loved football.

229
00:10:03,833 --> 00:10:05,549
He always made me watch it

230
00:10:05,551 --> 00:10:08,319
before I was allowed
to do my homework.

231
00:10:08,321 --> 00:10:09,336
Well, you'll
be happy

232
00:10:09,338 --> 00:10:10,838
to know I just
spoke to Zack

233
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:12,523
and he's willing to
sign the court papers.

234
00:10:12,525 --> 00:10:13,841
He's on his way here now.

235
00:10:13,843 --> 00:10:16,677
Wait, you invited him here?
Yeah.

236
00:10:16,679 --> 00:10:18,512
I'm getting ready
to weigh in again.

237
00:10:18,514 --> 00:10:20,180
Come on.

238
00:10:21,116 --> 00:10:23,868
What do you think
they ought to do now?

239
00:10:23,870 --> 00:10:26,186
I would throw a quick slant
to a wideout,

240
00:10:26,188 --> 00:10:28,656
given that the defense
is showing blitz.

241
00:10:28,658 --> 00:10:31,792
Oh, I love a good blitz,
especially with sour cream.

242
00:10:34,379 --> 00:10:36,130
Get it?

243
00:10:36,132 --> 00:10:38,499
'Cause it sounds like "blintz."

244
00:10:39,384 --> 00:10:41,752
Did someone say "blintz"?!

245
00:10:42,921 --> 00:10:44,037
I just don't
understand

246
00:10:44,039 --> 00:10:45,539
why you invited
him here today.

247
00:10:45,541 --> 00:10:46,640
Because you wouldn't
shut up about it.

248
00:10:46,642 --> 00:10:48,142
When I called him,
he had nothing to do,

249
00:10:48,144 --> 00:10:49,176
so I just thought it would...

250
00:10:49,178 --> 00:10:50,978
Hey, guys, I'm trying
to cook in here.

251
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:52,313
Oh, sorry.
We'll keep it down.

252
00:10:52,315 --> 00:10:55,065
No, no, speak up.

253
00:10:55,067 --> 00:10:56,517
I'm about to use the blender,

254
00:10:56,519 --> 00:10:58,319
and I don't want
to miss anything.

255
00:10:59,154 --> 00:11:01,221
Well, you might have
to cook for one more

256
00:11:01,223 --> 00:11:02,406
because she
invited Zack.

257
00:11:02,408 --> 00:11:04,241
- What?
- Ooh!

258
00:11:05,410 --> 00:11:07,227
My, my.

259
00:11:07,229 --> 00:11:10,831
The plot, like my gravy,
thickens.

260
00:11:15,187 --> 00:11:17,421
I don't care for your
mother's bathroom.

261
00:11:17,423 --> 00:11:19,623
There's not an angle
to do one's business

262
00:11:19,625 --> 00:11:22,242
without a clown figurine
staring at you.

263
00:11:23,628 --> 00:11:26,013
That's why I sit.

264
00:11:26,015 --> 00:11:28,432
Yeah, that's why.

265
00:11:30,585 --> 00:11:32,770
You remember
the Thanksgiving game

266
00:11:32,772 --> 00:11:34,755
when it snowed
in Dallas?

267
00:11:34,757 --> 00:11:38,392
1993-- Leon Lett blew the game
in the final seconds

268
00:11:38,394 --> 00:11:40,361
and the Dolphins
emerged victorious.

269
00:11:40,363 --> 00:11:43,364
Then I finally got to do
my calculus.

270
00:11:43,366 --> 00:11:46,817
I was so pissed,
I wanted to shoot my TV.

271
00:11:46,819 --> 00:11:48,736
So was my dad.

272
00:11:48,738 --> 00:11:51,038
And then he did.

273
00:11:51,957 --> 00:11:53,874
Anyone need a beer?
Yeah.

274
00:11:53,876 --> 00:11:56,276
Thank God.

275
00:11:56,278 --> 00:11:59,213
So, does your dad
still live in Texas?

276
00:11:59,215 --> 00:12:01,832
No. He died when I was 14.

277
00:12:03,018 --> 00:12:05,002
I'm sorry to hear that.

278
00:12:05,004 --> 00:12:07,721
So was the man who owned
the local liquor store.

279
00:12:09,007 --> 00:12:12,193
He cried and cried.

280
00:12:12,195 --> 00:12:13,894
Here you go.

281
00:12:13,896 --> 00:12:15,930
Oh, thanks.

282
00:12:15,932 --> 00:12:18,732
So, if your dad died
when you were 14,

283
00:12:18,734 --> 00:12:21,902
you were never old enough
to have a beer with the man.

284
00:12:21,904 --> 00:12:23,187
No, sir.

285
00:12:23,189 --> 00:12:26,156
He did try to give me one
for my high school graduation,

286
00:12:26,158 --> 00:12:29,493
but I was 11 and my mom said no.

287
00:12:33,632 --> 00:12:36,000
Well, you're having one with me.

288
00:12:40,755 --> 00:12:42,373
All right.

289
00:12:44,009 --> 00:12:45,676
To your dad.

290
00:12:49,464 --> 00:12:53,217
I never had a beer
with my dad, either.

291
00:12:56,504 --> 00:12:59,223
Do you mind?
We're having a moment here.

292
00:13:06,982 --> 00:13:09,233
I can't believe Penny's
married to Zack.

293
00:13:09,235 --> 00:13:10,935
Wonder what she saw
in that guy.

294
00:13:10,937 --> 00:13:12,436
I don't know.

295
00:13:12,438 --> 00:13:14,455
He's sweet, he's tall, handsome.

296
00:13:14,457 --> 00:13:16,373
Broad shoulders, good hair.

297
00:13:16,375 --> 00:13:18,909
Hmm. Wonder what she
sees in Leonard.

298
00:13:22,013 --> 00:13:23,497
How's it going out there?

299
00:13:23,499 --> 00:13:27,217
Sheldon and your dad are bonding
and completely ignoring me.

300
00:13:27,219 --> 00:13:29,303
I know how you feel.

301
00:13:29,305 --> 00:13:33,140
Sheldon ignored me for a week
when he got that Roomba vacuum.

302
00:13:34,542 --> 00:13:36,877
I kick it when he's not looking.

303
00:13:38,930 --> 00:13:40,230
What are they doing?

304
00:13:40,232 --> 00:13:44,685
They're drinking beer
and watching football.

305
00:13:44,687 --> 00:13:46,053
They don't want me.

306
00:13:46,055 --> 00:13:47,154
What do you mean?

307
00:13:47,156 --> 00:13:48,639
Well, Sheldon
started talking

308
00:13:48,641 --> 00:13:50,941
about how his dad
isn't alive anymore,

309
00:13:50,943 --> 00:13:52,392
and they were toasting,
and I tried

310
00:13:52,394 --> 00:13:53,861
to tell them about how sad I was

311
00:13:53,863 --> 00:13:54,995
when my dad abandoned...

312
00:13:54,997 --> 00:13:56,847
Zack's here!

313
00:13:56,849 --> 00:13:59,116
Stir the gravy.

314
00:14:01,369 --> 00:14:03,537
Sorry. I really want
to hear how sad you are.

315
00:14:03,539 --> 00:14:05,956
I'll be back in like five,
ten minutes.

316
00:14:10,011 --> 00:14:12,546
Sorry she made you come
over here on a holiday.

317
00:14:12,548 --> 00:14:14,598
It's all right.
I didn't have anything going on.

318
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:16,216
Plus, Penny told me
we're married,

319
00:14:16,218 --> 00:14:18,836
and Thanksgiving's a time
to be with family.

320
00:14:19,721 --> 00:14:20,688
Yeah, okay, great.

321
00:14:20,690 --> 00:14:21,890
Can we just get
this over with?

322
00:14:21,891 --> 00:14:24,808
Yeah, uh, you guys
have to sign here and here.

323
00:14:24,810 --> 00:14:26,610
On Monday, we'll file
for the annulment,

324
00:14:26,612 --> 00:14:28,445
and this "marriage"
will be over.

325
00:14:28,447 --> 00:14:29,780
Okay.

326
00:14:29,782 --> 00:14:32,232
I don't know
if I want to sign it.

327
00:14:32,234 --> 00:14:34,451
Ooh. Ooh.
Ooh.

328
00:14:36,454 --> 00:14:37,871
Why won't you sign it?

329
00:14:37,873 --> 00:14:41,608
I just think splitting up
can be rough on kids.

330
00:14:42,494 --> 00:14:43,744
We don't have any kids.

331
00:14:43,746 --> 00:14:45,379
Are you sure?
'Cause you didn't know

332
00:14:45,381 --> 00:14:47,131
we were married
until this morning.

333
00:14:49,384 --> 00:14:50,834
Okay, look, Zack, come on.

334
00:14:50,836 --> 00:14:53,003
You know neither of us
thought this was real.

335
00:14:53,005 --> 00:14:55,973
I mean, we were married
by an Elvis impersonator.

336
00:14:55,975 --> 00:14:57,457
Of course it was
an impersonator.

337
00:14:57,459 --> 00:15:00,144
We could never afford
a real Elvis.

338
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:04,848
You married him
instead of me?

339
00:15:04,850 --> 00:15:06,650
Good call.

340
00:15:06,652 --> 00:15:08,235
Sign the papers.

341
00:15:08,237 --> 00:15:09,520
Hang on.
You know what?

342
00:15:09,522 --> 00:15:11,405
You have been a jerk
about this all day.

343
00:15:11,407 --> 00:15:12,906
You always do this--
whenever I mess up,

344
00:15:12,908 --> 00:15:14,908
you're right there to make me
feel even worse about it.

345
00:15:14,910 --> 00:15:15,976
That is not true.

346
00:15:15,978 --> 00:15:17,144
Yeah, we could've
waited till Monday,

347
00:15:17,146 --> 00:15:18,696
signed the papers,
this all would have been over.

348
00:15:18,698 --> 00:15:20,280
You're the one who
invited him here.

349
00:15:20,282 --> 00:15:21,865
Oh, there you go again--
just another mistake

350
00:15:21,867 --> 00:15:22,916
you're throwing in my face.

351
00:15:22,918 --> 00:15:24,651
Not cool, bro.

352
00:15:26,454 --> 00:15:27,921
I'm starting to think

353
00:15:27,923 --> 00:15:30,541
you're not the kind of guy
I want dating my wife.

354
00:15:32,377 --> 00:15:34,327
Yeah, well,

355
00:15:34,329 --> 00:15:35,929
she's not gonna be
your wife for long.

356
00:15:35,931 --> 00:15:38,832
Oh, no. Are you dying?

357
00:15:39,684 --> 00:15:41,885
I'm about to. Sign the paper.

358
00:15:43,671 --> 00:15:47,608
Know what they say:
"Happy wife, happy life."

359
00:15:48,810 --> 00:15:50,360
Let's eat.

360
00:15:53,782 --> 00:15:58,652
Two, three,
eight, four, six.

361
00:16:01,456 --> 00:16:03,490
That's all I can do
without throwing up.

362
00:16:05,077 --> 00:16:06,693
That is not what I expected

363
00:16:06,695 --> 00:16:09,663
when you said you
were gonna burp "pie."

364
00:16:11,049 --> 00:16:13,584
Did somebody say "pie"?!

365
00:16:14,586 --> 00:16:16,170
I don't know what's scarier:

366
00:16:16,172 --> 00:16:17,671
the bathroom clowns

367
00:16:17,673 --> 00:16:20,474
or the woman
that put them there.

368
00:16:21,542 --> 00:16:25,212
All I know is you can only fit
one of her in a car.

369
00:16:28,349 --> 00:16:30,067
And there's the clown
that came out of her.

370
00:16:35,056 --> 00:16:37,524
I really didn't want
to come here,

371
00:16:37,526 --> 00:16:39,443
but this is shaping up to be

372
00:16:39,445 --> 00:16:41,995
one of the best Thanksgivings
I've had in a long time.

373
00:16:41,997 --> 00:16:44,231
Me, too.

374
00:16:44,233 --> 00:16:47,234
Hey. Howie says you've been
making fun of him all day!

375
00:16:47,236 --> 00:16:48,418
Now, both of you
apologize

376
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:50,087
right now!

377
00:16:50,955 --> 00:16:53,123
She's so tiny.

378
00:16:56,711 --> 00:16:59,179
It's funny when she's mad.

379
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:03,967
All right, mister,
I think you owe

380
00:17:03,969 --> 00:17:06,804
Howard and Bernadette
an apology.

381
00:17:08,089 --> 00:17:11,942
Perhaps you're right.

382
00:17:11,944 --> 00:17:13,426
I'm sorry for my behavior.

383
00:17:13,428 --> 00:17:15,612
I've had alcohol,
and it's caused me

384
00:17:15,614 --> 00:17:16,814
to be inappropriate.

385
00:17:16,816 --> 00:17:18,816
It's okay.
Don't worry about it.

386
00:17:18,818 --> 00:17:20,734
Thank you.

387
00:17:20,736 --> 00:17:22,236
Ain't she great?

388
00:17:22,238 --> 00:17:23,320
Mmm.

389
00:17:23,322 --> 00:17:24,655
Sheldon.

390
00:17:24,657 --> 00:17:26,606
Now, how's about you get us
a couple of beers?

391
00:17:43,827 --> 00:17:45,144
Thanks again
for cooking.

392
00:17:45,146 --> 00:17:46,662
Yeah, everything
was delicious.

393
00:17:46,664 --> 00:17:47,663
Well, I couldn't

394
00:17:47,665 --> 00:17:50,133
have done it without
my two favorite girls.

395
00:17:50,135 --> 00:17:51,150
Aw.

396
00:17:51,152 --> 00:17:53,369
Martha Stewart and Rachael Ray.

397
00:17:57,174 --> 00:17:59,842
Hey, Sheldon, what do you say
we go outside

398
00:17:59,844 --> 00:18:01,928
and throw around
the old pigskin?

399
00:18:02,796 --> 00:18:04,764
This is a Jewish house.

400
00:18:04,766 --> 00:18:06,516
I don't think they have pigskin.

401
00:18:08,986 --> 00:18:11,938
Did so!

402
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:15,391
Hey, honey, I'm
sorry about today.

403
00:18:15,393 --> 00:18:17,510
And I promise, next
time I get married,

404
00:18:17,512 --> 00:18:19,061
it won't be a joke.

405
00:18:19,063 --> 00:18:20,679
It'll be for love.

406
00:18:20,681 --> 00:18:22,815
Or money.

407
00:18:25,769 --> 00:18:27,120
I'm sorry, too.

408
00:18:27,122 --> 00:18:28,654
Don't be.

409
00:18:28,656 --> 00:18:29,655
It's my fault.

410
00:18:29,657 --> 00:18:31,073
I was a terrible husband.

411
00:18:32,709 --> 00:18:35,378
I was never around.

412
00:18:37,197 --> 00:18:39,215
I know I'm hard on you,

413
00:18:39,217 --> 00:18:42,001
but you're not the worst
son-in-law in the world.

414
00:18:42,003 --> 00:18:44,921
Mike, that's the nicest thing
you've ever said to me.

415
00:18:44,923 --> 00:18:47,723
Well, I'm drunk.

416
00:18:50,994 --> 00:18:53,229
I just vomited
on a lot of clowns.
