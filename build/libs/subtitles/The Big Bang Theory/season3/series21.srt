1
00:00:02,790 --> 00:00:04,357
Hold.

2
00:00:04,358 --> 00:00:05,325
What?

3
00:00:05,326 --> 00:00:06,959
Explain your sneeze.

4
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:08,661
I'm sorry?

5
00:00:08,662 --> 00:00:10,396
Do you have allergies?
No.

6
00:00:10,397 --> 00:00:11,930
Is there too much pepper
on your salad?

7
00:00:11,931 --> 00:00:13,065
I don't put pepper on salads.

8
00:00:13,066 --> 00:00:14,266
I've heard enough.
Sit over there.

9
00:00:14,267 --> 00:00:16,768
Oh, come on.

10
00:00:16,769 --> 00:00:17,969
I don't want to sit by myself.

11
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:19,139
That's what Typhoid Mary said,

12
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:21,082
and clearly,
her friends buckled.

13
00:00:21,083 --> 00:00:22,827
Guys, help me.

14
00:00:22,828 --> 00:00:24,028
Sheldon, come on.

15
00:00:24,029 --> 00:00:26,053
Yeah, it's just
one sneeze.
(sneezes)

16
00:00:26,054 --> 00:00:27,604
You're on your own.
See you, buddy.

17
00:00:29,617 --> 00:00:31,404
Oh, Leonard,
I have something for you.

18
00:00:31,405 --> 00:00:33,862
Per our roommate agreement,
this is

19
00:00:33,863 --> 00:00:36,062
your 24-hour notice
that I will be having

20
00:00:36,063 --> 00:00:39,446
a non-related female spending
two nights in our apartment.

21
00:00:41,219 --> 00:00:42,775
When you say
"non-related female,"

22
00:00:42,776 --> 00:00:45,535
you still mean
human, right?

23
00:00:45,536 --> 00:00:46,823
Of course.

24
00:00:46,824 --> 00:00:48,842
Pets are banned under
the roommate agreement,

25
00:00:48,843 --> 00:00:51,969
with the exception of service
animals, such as seeing eye dogs

26
00:00:51,970 --> 00:00:55,164
and, one day, cybernetically-
enhanced helper monkeys.

27
00:00:55,165 --> 00:00:59,429
Are you planning on
kidnapping a woman?

28
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:00,770
Sarcasm?

29
00:01:00,771 --> 00:01:04,462
Yes, but mixed with
genuine concern.

30
00:01:04,463 --> 00:01:07,682
For your information,
I'll be playing host

31
00:01:07,683 --> 00:01:09,227
to Dr. Elizabeth Plimpton.

32
00:01:10,367 --> 00:01:11,874
The cosmological physicist
from Princeton?

33
00:01:11,875 --> 00:01:12,881
Yes.

34
00:01:12,882 --> 00:01:15,167
And until you acquire
a surgical mask,

35
00:01:15,168 --> 00:01:17,513
please address your comments
to me through a napkin.

36
00:01:18,854 --> 00:01:20,598
We've been corresponding
for years about

37
00:01:20,599 --> 00:01:21,870
our mutual interest in

38
00:01:21,871 --> 00:01:23,347
gravitational wave signatures

39
00:01:23,348 --> 00:01:25,358
of inflatons
in the early universe.

40
00:01:25,359 --> 00:01:27,169
And now she's
under consideration

41
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:29,013
for a position
at our university.

42
00:01:29,014 --> 00:01:31,724
Why didn't you tell me
you knew Elizabeth Plimpton?

43
00:01:31,725 --> 00:01:33,969
I am a huge fan of hers!

44
00:01:33,970 --> 00:01:36,316
I didn't realize I was obligated
to share my connection

45
00:01:36,317 --> 00:01:38,425
with things you're a fan of,
but very well.

46
00:01:38,426 --> 00:01:40,030
You enjoy Canadian bacon.

47
00:01:40,031 --> 00:01:41,806
I've been to Toronto.

48
00:01:41,807 --> 00:01:42,978
Okay, fine.

49
00:01:42,979 --> 00:01:44,320
Where is she going to sleep?

50
00:01:44,321 --> 00:01:46,462
My room, of course.

51
00:01:46,463 --> 00:01:47,633
Holy crap!

52
00:01:50,381 --> 00:01:52,721
Holy crap!

53
00:01:52,722 --> 00:01:55,097
Yeah, um, I have
a two-part question.

54
00:01:55,098 --> 00:01:56,101
Go ahead.

55
00:01:56,102 --> 00:01:57,606
A) Are you kidding me?

56
00:01:57,607 --> 00:02:01,011
And B) seriously,
are you freaking kidding me?

57
00:02:01,012 --> 00:02:03,243
A) I rarely kid.

58
00:02:03,244 --> 00:02:05,409
And B) when I do kid,
you will know it

59
00:02:05,410 --> 00:02:08,042
by my use of
the word "bazinga."

60
00:02:08,043 --> 00:02:10,007
So you're saying the two of you

61
00:02:10,008 --> 00:02:12,483
are going to be sleeping
in the same bed?

62
00:02:12,484 --> 00:02:14,123
Yes.

63
00:02:14,124 --> 00:02:15,326
Bazinga.

64
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:20,709
Leonard?

65
00:02:21,513 --> 00:02:23,452
Thank you.

66
00:02:23,453 --> 00:02:25,391
Why is a world-
renowned scientist

67
00:02:25,392 --> 00:02:27,397
staying in our apartment
instead of a hotel?

68
00:02:27,398 --> 00:02:29,001
Well, she doesn't care
for hotels.

69
00:02:29,002 --> 00:02:30,306
And who can blame her?

70
00:02:30,307 --> 00:02:31,376
Windows that don't open,

71
00:02:31,377 --> 00:02:32,912
multi-user linens,

72
00:02:32,913 --> 00:02:35,621
keys shaped like credit cards--
as if one walks around

73
00:02:35,622 --> 00:02:37,827
with unassigned slots
in one's wallet.

74
00:02:37,828 --> 00:02:39,199
All right,
I believe I have time

75
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,238
for one more question.

76
00:02:41,239 --> 00:02:42,375
(clears throat)

77
00:02:42,376 --> 00:02:43,978
Yes, Raj?

78
00:02:43,979 --> 00:02:45,917
When can I sit
with you again?

79
00:02:45,918 --> 00:02:46,953
When I've seen

80
00:02:46,954 --> 00:02:48,592
two consecutive
negative throat cultures

81
00:02:48,593 --> 00:02:50,497
spaced 12 hours apart.
You know the drill.

82
00:02:50,498 --> 00:02:52,202
All right,

83
00:02:52,203 --> 00:02:54,241
if you'll excuse me,
I am off to start

84
00:02:54,242 --> 00:02:57,014
a prophylactic course
of antibiotics.

85
00:02:58,953 --> 00:03:01,893
I can't believe he's friends
with Elizabeth Plimpton.

86
00:03:01,894 --> 00:03:04,601
I can't believe
they let him into Canada.

87
00:03:04,602 --> 00:03:06,171
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
You heard the man.

88
00:03:06,172 --> 00:03:07,709
Where's your throat cultures?

89
00:03:08,679 --> 00:03:10,717
Kidding. Sit down.
(chuckles)

90
00:03:11,587 --> 00:03:12,755
(sneezes)

91
00:03:18,771 --> 00:03:22,413
? Our whole universe
was in a hot, dense state ?

92
00:03:22,414 --> 00:03:25,755
? Then nearly 14 billion years
ago expansion started... Wait! ?

93
00:03:25,756 --> 00:03:27,392
? The Earth began to cool ?

94
00:03:27,393 --> 00:03:29,931
? The autotrophs began to drool,
Neanderthals developed tools ?

95
00:03:29,932 --> 00:03:32,638
? We built the Wall ?
? <i>We built the pyramids</i> ?

96
00:03:32,639 --> 00:03:35,281
? Math, Science, History,
unraveling the mystery ?

97
00:03:35,282 --> 00:03:37,185
? That all started
with a big bang ?

98
00:03:37,186 --> 00:03:39,157
? <i>Bang!</i> ?

101
00:03:47,061 --> 00:03:47,661
Hey, Sheldon.

102
00:03:47,764 --> 00:03:49,532
Oh, Penny, excellent.

103
00:03:49,533 --> 00:03:52,801
I have a question
about these maxi pads.

104
00:03:52,802 --> 00:03:55,403
Are the wings truly functional

105
00:03:55,404 --> 00:03:58,072
or have I fallen victim
to marketing hype?

106
00:03:58,073 --> 00:03:59,206
What?

107
00:03:59,207 --> 00:04:01,842
Why are you doing
with-- what?

108
00:04:01,843 --> 00:04:03,543
The stock boy at Walgreens

109
00:04:03,544 --> 00:04:05,645
was frustratingly uninformed
on the subject.

110
00:04:05,646 --> 00:04:08,514
Sheldon, what are you
doing with maxi pads?

111
00:04:08,515 --> 00:04:10,048
I have a lady friend

112
00:04:10,049 --> 00:04:12,217
who will be staying
with me for a few days.

113
00:04:12,218 --> 00:04:13,551
Oh.

114
00:04:13,552 --> 00:04:14,485
What?

115
00:04:14,486 --> 00:04:16,220
I want her to
feel at home.

116
00:04:16,221 --> 00:04:20,323
I also bought scented
soaps, pantyhose, Midol,

117
00:04:20,324 --> 00:04:23,693
calcium chews and what
is apparently a yogurt

118
00:04:23,694 --> 00:04:26,929
specifically designed to
regulate the female bowel.

119
00:04:28,931 --> 00:04:30,365
Wait, wait, hold
on, back up.

120
00:04:30,366 --> 00:04:32,333
You're having a
woman stay with you?

121
00:04:32,334 --> 00:04:33,367
Yes.

122
00:04:33,368 --> 00:04:35,369
Why does that seem
to flabbergast everybody?

123
00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:37,104
Oh... no,
no, no, no.

124
00:04:37,105 --> 00:04:38,338
I'm not flabbergasted.

125
00:04:38,339 --> 00:04:39,939
I'm... puzzled.

126
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:42,908
Yeah, let's go
with puzzled.

127
00:04:42,909 --> 00:04:43,943
A word of warning.

128
00:04:43,944 --> 00:04:45,911
My guest is a
noted physicist

129
00:04:45,912 --> 00:04:48,046
and the leading expert
on quantum cosmology,

130
00:04:48,047 --> 00:04:50,047
so please try to avoid
wasting her time

131
00:04:50,048 --> 00:04:53,416
with female
jibber jabber.

132
00:04:53,417 --> 00:04:55,051
Female jibber jabber?

133
00:04:55,052 --> 00:04:56,385
Shoe sales,
hair styles,

134
00:04:56,386 --> 00:05:00,521
mud masks, gossip about
your friends Brad and Angelina.

135
00:05:02,723 --> 00:05:04,089
Oh, they're not
my friends.

136
00:05:04,090 --> 00:05:05,589
I'm not surprised,
considering the way

137
00:05:05,590 --> 00:05:07,560
you talk about them
behind their backs.

138
00:05:10,701 --> 00:05:11,967
(knocking)

139
00:05:11,968 --> 00:05:12,902
She's here, she's here.

140
00:05:12,903 --> 00:05:15,103
How do I look?
Do I look smart?

141
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:17,939
Oh, good grief.

142
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:19,374
This isn't about you.

143
00:05:19,375 --> 00:05:20,408
Coming!

144
00:05:20,409 --> 00:05:21,475
Now, listen.

145
00:05:21,476 --> 00:05:22,576
One of the great minds

146
00:05:22,577 --> 00:05:25,045
of the 21st century
is about to play host

147
00:05:25,046 --> 00:05:28,214
to one of the other great
minds of the 21st century.

148
00:05:28,215 --> 00:05:30,048
So pay attention.

149
00:05:30,049 --> 00:05:31,216
Years from now,

150
00:05:31,217 --> 00:05:34,652
my biographer might ask
you about this event.

151
00:05:34,653 --> 00:05:38,488
Oh, I have so many things
to tell your biographer.

152
00:05:38,489 --> 00:05:39,722
(sighs)

153
00:05:39,723 --> 00:05:41,023
Dr. Cooper, thank goodness.

154
00:05:41,024 --> 00:05:42,924
I completely
forgot your address.

155
00:05:42,925 --> 00:05:45,559
But then I remembered that
I'd written it on my hand.

156
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:46,827
Lucky for me,

157
00:05:46,828 --> 00:05:48,395
I didn't confuse it
with what I'd written

158
00:05:48,396 --> 00:05:49,963
on my other hand,
which are the coordinates

159
00:05:49,964 --> 00:05:52,066
for a newly discovered
neutron star.

160
00:05:52,067 --> 00:05:54,968
'Cause if I tried to go there,
I'd be crushed by hypergravity.

161
00:05:56,103 --> 00:05:58,304
Anyway, hello.
Hello.

162
00:05:58,305 --> 00:06:00,205
Nice to finally
meet you in person.

163
00:06:00,206 --> 00:06:01,740
I would imagine it is.

164
00:06:04,377 --> 00:06:07,078
This is my friend and roommate,
Dr. Leonard Hofstadter.

165
00:06:07,079 --> 00:06:09,013
Hi-lo.

166
00:06:09,014 --> 00:06:10,181
(chuckles)
Oops.

167
00:06:10,182 --> 00:06:11,651
I-I started to say "hi,"

168
00:06:11,652 --> 00:06:13,953
and then I switched to "hello"
in the middle.

169
00:06:13,954 --> 00:06:15,921
It came out "hi-lo."

170
00:06:16,689 --> 00:06:18,322
Duh.
(chuckles)

171
00:06:18,323 --> 00:06:20,889
Uh, it's nice
to meet you.

172
00:06:20,890 --> 00:06:23,325
I-I've read both your books
and most of your papers.

173
00:06:23,326 --> 00:06:27,129
I-I'm Leonard, I live
here, you're brilliant.

174
00:06:27,130 --> 00:06:28,197
I apologize.

175
00:06:28,198 --> 00:06:30,665
He's only
an experimental physicist.

176
00:06:30,666 --> 00:06:32,200
No need to apologize.

177
00:06:32,201 --> 00:06:34,902
Some of my best friends
are experimental physicists.

178
00:06:34,903 --> 00:06:35,903
Well, not

179
00:06:35,904 --> 00:06:37,905
my best friends,
but I know them.

180
00:06:38,907 --> 00:06:39,840
My best friend is

181
00:06:39,841 --> 00:06:41,541
a molecular chemist
named Wendy.

182
00:06:41,542 --> 00:06:43,543
I'm sorry, I'm rambling.

183
00:06:43,544 --> 00:06:44,543
Hi-lo.

184
00:06:44,544 --> 00:06:46,178
(chuckles)

185
00:06:46,179 --> 00:06:47,146
Are you hungry,
thirsty?

186
00:06:47,147 --> 00:06:48,311
Can I offer
you anything?

187
00:06:48,312 --> 00:06:49,778
No, she's my guest.
If anyone should

188
00:06:49,779 --> 00:06:51,311
offer her anything,
it should be me.

189
00:06:51,312 --> 00:06:53,247
Elizabeth, can I
get you something?

190
00:06:53,248 --> 00:06:54,782
Perhaps a feminine
hygiene product

191
00:06:54,783 --> 00:06:57,450
or a bowel-regulating yogurt?

192
00:06:57,451 --> 00:06:59,218
Interesting choices.

193
00:06:59,219 --> 00:07:02,087
Based on my current needs,
I guess I'd pick the yogurt.

194
00:07:02,088 --> 00:07:03,088
Excellent.

195
00:07:03,089 --> 00:07:04,422
If the yogurt works,

196
00:07:04,423 --> 00:07:07,224
I bought some delightful
scented candles.

197
00:07:12,562 --> 00:07:14,029
Look, it's you.

198
00:07:16,565 --> 00:07:19,500
Thank you so much
for opening up your home to me.

199
00:07:19,501 --> 00:07:22,569
Well, who wants
to stay in a hotel?

200
00:07:22,570 --> 00:07:26,306
Windows that don't open,
those crazy card-shaped keys.

201
00:07:26,307 --> 00:07:27,742
I'm so glad you understand.

202
00:07:27,743 --> 00:07:30,144
No, he doesn't understand.

203
00:07:30,145 --> 00:07:31,178
I understand.

204
00:07:31,179 --> 00:07:32,380
Well, I understand, too.

205
00:07:32,381 --> 00:07:34,982
You're just misappropriating
my understanding.

206
00:07:34,983 --> 00:07:36,250
Oh...
(blows raspberries)

207
00:07:37,218 --> 00:07:39,752
I think any university
would want you.

208
00:07:39,753 --> 00:07:40,853
Except, of course,

209
00:07:40,854 --> 00:07:42,589
any university
that had already had you.

210
00:07:42,590 --> 00:07:44,390
Because they would've
already wanted you

211
00:07:44,391 --> 00:07:46,525
before they,
you know, got you.

212
00:07:47,827 --> 00:07:50,961
From the mind that
brought you "hi-lo."

213
00:07:52,363 --> 00:07:54,531
Let me show you to your room.

214
00:07:54,532 --> 00:07:55,632
All right.

215
00:07:55,633 --> 00:07:57,534
I guess I am tired.
Good night, Leonard.

216
00:07:57,535 --> 00:07:59,302
Uh, sleep night.

217
00:07:59,303 --> 00:08:00,904
I mean, obously, good night.

218
00:08:00,905 --> 00:08:02,204
I started to say "sleep tight,"

219
00:08:02,205 --> 00:08:04,137
then I changed my mind
in the middle.

220
00:08:04,138 --> 00:08:06,404
I swear to God, I'm smart.

221
00:08:09,241 --> 00:08:10,875
Get it together, man.

222
00:08:13,344 --> 00:08:16,112
All right, let
me show you

223
00:08:16,113 --> 00:08:18,281
some of the features
of the room.

224
00:08:18,282 --> 00:08:19,882
First, windows.

225
00:08:19,883 --> 00:08:20,883
Conventional.

226
00:08:20,884 --> 00:08:22,518
Open, closed.

227
00:08:22,519 --> 00:08:23,819
Open, closed.

228
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:25,253
Halfway open.

229
00:08:25,254 --> 00:08:27,989
Or halfway closed, depending on
your philosophical bent.

230
00:08:29,124 --> 00:08:31,058
Over here is
my comic book collection.

231
00:08:31,059 --> 00:08:32,292
Feel free to browse.

232
00:08:32,293 --> 00:08:34,394
There's a box of
disposable reading gloves

233
00:08:34,395 --> 00:08:36,863
on the night stand.

234
00:08:36,864 --> 00:08:38,364
Good to know.

235
00:08:38,365 --> 00:08:39,698
In here, you'll find

236
00:08:39,699 --> 00:08:41,800
emergency provisions.

237
00:08:41,801 --> 00:08:44,836
An eight-day supply
of food and water, a crossbow,

238
00:08:44,837 --> 00:08:47,638
season two of <i>Star Trek:</i>
<i>The Original Series</i>

239
00:08:47,639 --> 00:08:49,440
on a high-density flash drive.

240
00:08:50,175 --> 00:08:51,441
What if there's
a disaster

241
00:08:51,442 --> 00:08:53,309
that destroys all
the USB ports?

242
00:08:53,310 --> 00:08:56,212
Then there's really
no reason to live, is there?

243
00:08:56,213 --> 00:08:59,047
Can I ask a question
about your roommate?

244
00:08:59,048 --> 00:09:01,783
He's an odd duck, isn't he?

245
00:09:01,784 --> 00:09:03,951
What's his relationship status?

246
00:09:03,952 --> 00:09:06,887
Well, there was
a misbegotten adventure

247
00:09:06,888 --> 00:09:09,123
with a waitress
who lives across the hall.

248
00:09:09,124 --> 00:09:11,391
It ended as inexplicably
as it began.

249
00:09:11,392 --> 00:09:13,126
They had
very little in common,

250
00:09:13,127 --> 00:09:14,927
except for carnal activity.

251
00:09:14,928 --> 00:09:15,995
That's why I acquired

252
00:09:15,996 --> 00:09:18,464
these noise-canceling
headphones.

253
00:09:18,465 --> 00:09:20,299
If you decide
to use them,

254
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:22,067
please clean the ear
pieces afterwards

255
00:09:22,068 --> 00:09:24,202
with the Wet Wipes you'll
find in the bathroom.

256
00:09:24,203 --> 00:09:26,671
They're in the drawer
labeled "Wet Wipes."

257
00:09:26,672 --> 00:09:28,039
Okay.

258
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:28,939
Good. I'll leave you

259
00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:30,941
to your nighttime
ablutions.

260
00:09:30,942 --> 00:09:33,176
I've e-mailed you the
morning bathroom schedule.

261
00:09:33,177 --> 00:09:36,913
You'll also find a laminated
copy in your welcome packet.

262
00:09:38,482 --> 00:09:41,251
It's on the back of the
emergency escape route diagram.

263
00:09:41,252 --> 00:09:42,285
How thoughtful.

264
00:09:42,286 --> 00:09:44,487
Sleep well,
my friend.
You, too.

265
00:09:45,322 --> 00:09:48,724
Oh, let me just
get one thing.

266
00:09:48,725 --> 00:09:51,226
It's my backup
emergency supply kit.

267
00:09:51,227 --> 00:09:54,529
The living room escape route
doesn't pass through here.

268
00:09:54,530 --> 00:09:55,764
Now, good night.

269
00:09:55,765 --> 00:09:58,232
And if there's an apocalypse,
good luck.

270
00:10:00,935 --> 00:10:03,836
(knocking)

271
00:10:03,837 --> 00:10:05,303
Yes?

272
00:10:05,304 --> 00:10:08,205
I saw your light on.

273
00:10:08,206 --> 00:10:09,473
Is everything all right?

274
00:10:09,474 --> 00:10:11,341
Yeah, I just couldn't sleep.

275
00:10:11,342 --> 00:10:13,176
Me neither.

276
00:10:13,177 --> 00:10:14,877
Oh, look what I'm reading.

277
00:10:14,878 --> 00:10:16,612
It's you.

278
00:10:16,613 --> 00:10:18,247
I thought you already read it.

279
00:10:18,248 --> 00:10:19,648
I did, but it's been a while,

280
00:10:19,649 --> 00:10:23,218
and I wanted to sound smart
over breakfast.

281
00:10:23,219 --> 00:10:25,219
Aw, you're smart.

282
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:26,286
Oh, good.

283
00:10:26,287 --> 00:10:27,854
Wasn't sure
it was coming across.

284
00:10:27,855 --> 00:10:30,190
What chapter are you on?

285
00:10:30,191 --> 00:10:31,724
Uh, six.

286
00:10:31,725 --> 00:10:35,726
Oh, the extragalactic
distance ladder.

287
00:10:35,727 --> 00:10:37,327
Want to know
a little secret?

288
00:10:37,328 --> 00:10:39,062
Sure.

289
00:10:39,063 --> 00:10:40,964
I wrote the section
on the Wilson-Bappu Effect

290
00:10:40,965 --> 00:10:42,631
completely naked.

291
00:10:45,468 --> 00:10:47,570
Really?

292
00:10:47,571 --> 00:10:49,807
Uh, sure doesn't
read that way.

293
00:10:49,808 --> 00:10:51,777
Here, let me show yo

294
00:10:51,778 --> 00:10:53,880
(clears throat)

295
00:10:53,881 --> 00:10:56,349
When we consider the brightness
of pulsating variable stars,

296
00:10:56,350 --> 00:10:57,516
we start to see

297
00:10:57,517 --> 00:11:00,319
a possible explanation
for some of the discrepancies

298
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:03,288
found in Hubble's constant.

299
00:11:03,289 --> 00:11:06,557
Wow.

300
00:11:06,558 --> 00:11:09,626
You really make
science come alive.

301
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:17,074

302
00:11:20,987 --> 00:11:23,888
(alarm buzzing)

303
00:11:23,889 --> 00:11:25,423
(buzzing stops)

304
00:11:31,098 --> 00:11:33,300
Vocal test.
Morning vocal test.

305
00:11:33,313 --> 00:11:34,580
(clearing throat)

306
00:11:34,581 --> 00:11:35,748
Second vocal test.

307
00:11:35,749 --> 00:11:37,483
(deep voice):
Second morning vocal test.

308
00:11:37,484 --> 00:11:38,985
Morning, Sheldon.

309
00:11:38,986 --> 00:11:40,019
Morning.

310
00:11:40,020 --> 00:11:41,053
Morning, Sheldon.

311
00:11:41,054 --> 00:11:41,987
Morning.

312
00:11:41,988 --> 00:11:43,488
I trust
you had a pleasant night.

313
00:11:43,489 --> 00:11:44,622
More than pleasant.

314
00:11:44,623 --> 00:11:46,357
(both giggling)

315
00:11:47,192 --> 00:11:49,993
(giggling)

316
00:11:49,994 --> 00:11:53,231
Excuse me, I'm going
to relieve myself.

317
00:11:54,433 --> 00:11:55,900
How do you take your coffee?

318
00:11:55,901 --> 00:11:57,935
Black.
Okeydoke.

319
00:11:57,936 --> 00:12:00,271
(urinating in bathroom)

320
00:12:00,272 --> 00:12:02,439
SHELDON:
Pee for Houston, pee for Austin,

321
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:05,609
pee for the state
my heart got lost in.

322
00:12:08,345 --> 00:12:11,246
And shake twice
for Texas.

323
00:12:15,551 --> 00:12:18,719
Something his
mother taught him.

324
00:12:19,821 --> 00:12:21,388
All right, Elizabeth,

325
00:12:21,389 --> 00:12:22,955
the bathroom is yours.

326
00:12:22,956 --> 00:12:26,258
The seat is down, and has been
sanitized for your protection.

327
00:12:26,259 --> 00:12:29,227
That's very thoughtful,
but I think I'll finish
my coffee first.

328
00:12:29,228 --> 00:12:30,394
(knocking)

329
00:12:30,395 --> 00:12:33,363
Ah, so the yogurt didn't work.

330
00:12:33,364 --> 00:12:34,931
I'll fire off

331
00:12:34,932 --> 00:12:37,733
a critical e-mail
to the manufacturer.

332
00:12:37,734 --> 00:12:38,800
Oh, good, you're up.

333
00:12:38,801 --> 00:12:40,168
Look, my car won't start.

334
00:12:40,169 --> 00:12:41,402
I need a ride to work.

335
00:12:41,403 --> 00:12:43,770
Did you once again ignore
your "check engine" light?

336
00:12:43,771 --> 00:12:45,372
No, Mr. smarty-pants.

337
00:12:45,373 --> 00:12:48,107
I ignored the
"fill gas tank" light.

338
00:12:48,108 --> 00:12:51,643
Leonard, Penny wants
to exploit any residual
feelings you have for her

339
00:12:51,644 --> 00:12:53,579
in order to get
a ride to work.

340
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:56,615
Oh, yeah, sure, let me just
put this in a travel mug.

341
00:12:56,616 --> 00:12:58,149
Hello.

342
00:12:58,150 --> 00:12:59,417
Hi.

343
00:12:59,418 --> 00:13:01,919
Oh, Penny, this
is Dr. Plimpton--

344
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:04,687
a leading expert
on quantum cosmology.

345
00:13:04,688 --> 00:13:06,555
Dr. Plimpton, Penny
is a waitress

346
00:13:06,556 --> 00:13:08,757
who doesn't understand
the role gasoline plays

347
00:13:08,758 --> 00:13:10,858
in the internal
combustion engine.

348
00:13:10,859 --> 00:13:12,994
Nice to meet you.

349
00:13:12,995 --> 00:13:13,995
Nice to meet you, too.

350
00:13:13,996 --> 00:13:15,129
Are you enjoying your stay?

351
00:13:15,130 --> 00:13:16,797
Yes, very much.

352
00:13:19,667 --> 00:13:21,968
Good.

353
00:13:21,969 --> 00:13:25,105
Wonderful. Meaningless
pleasantries accomplished.

354
00:13:25,106 --> 00:13:26,807
Elizabeth, Leonard's
bathroom time is coming up,

355
00:13:26,808 --> 00:13:29,209
and believe me, you do
not want to follow him.

356
00:13:29,210 --> 00:13:31,745
Excuse me.

357
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:35,081
Okay, well, I guess
I should get dressed

358
00:13:35,082 --> 00:13:36,681
so I can take everyone to work.

359
00:13:36,682 --> 00:13:37,882
You and Sheldon

360
00:13:37,883 --> 00:13:38,983
and Sheldon's friend,

361
00:13:38,984 --> 00:13:40,717
Dr. Plimpton, who
you just met.

362
00:13:40,718 --> 00:13:42,385
Gonna be fun.

363
00:13:42,386 --> 00:13:44,553
Like a clown car.

364
00:13:44,554 --> 00:13:45,587
Hang on.
Hmm?

365
00:13:45,588 --> 00:13:47,255
Yeah? What? Huh?

366
00:13:47,256 --> 00:13:48,923
We just broke up.

367
00:13:48,924 --> 00:13:50,124
Wha-- uh, you and me?
Yeah, we did.

368
00:13:50,125 --> 00:13:51,092
Not too long ago.

369
00:13:51,093 --> 00:13:52,893
How are you
doing with it?

370
00:13:52,894 --> 00:13:55,061
Not as good as you
apparently.

371
00:13:55,062 --> 00:13:56,563
I, um, I don't follow.

372
00:13:56,564 --> 00:13:58,199
You know what?
It's, it's none of my business.

373
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:00,168
If you want to sleep
with Sheldon's doctor buddy

374
00:14:00,169 --> 00:14:02,470
right after we stopped
seeing each other, go for it.

375
00:14:02,471 --> 00:14:04,305
Well, now...
SHELDON:
Excuse me.

376
00:14:04,306 --> 00:14:07,107
I'm uncomfortable
with you recommending

377
00:14:07,108 --> 00:14:09,609
that Leonard pursue having
intercourse with Dr. Plimpton,

378
00:14:09,610 --> 00:14:13,179
who I assure you has
better things to do.

379
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:14,314
I'm not recommending it.

380
00:14:14,315 --> 00:14:16,249
I'm saying it
already happened.

381
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:17,716
That's preposterous.

382
00:14:17,717 --> 00:14:19,718
Tell her, Leonard.

383
00:14:19,719 --> 00:14:22,586
Well...

384
00:14:24,589 --> 00:14:26,523
No.

385
00:14:26,524 --> 00:14:28,525
Come on. It wasn't my fault.

386
00:14:28,526 --> 00:14:31,228
The implication being
that you sow tripped

387
00:14:31,229 --> 00:14:35,097
and fell into her lady parts?

388
00:14:35,098 --> 00:14:36,398
You know what?

389
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:38,033
I'm just gonna take the bus
to work.

390
00:14:38,034 --> 00:14:39,334
Penny, I can still drive you.

391
00:14:39,335 --> 00:14:40,402
Oh, no, no,
it's okay.

392
00:14:40,403 --> 00:14:42,036
You might slip on a banana peel

393
00:14:42,037 --> 00:14:43,771
and get me pregnant.

394
00:14:44,606 --> 00:14:46,307
I must say,

395
00:14:46,308 --> 00:14:48,442
I'm ocked by
this betrayal.

396
00:14:48,443 --> 00:14:49,976
I didn't betray Penny.

397
00:14:49,977 --> 00:14:52,411
Not Penny, me!

398
00:14:52,412 --> 00:14:54,079
How am I betraying you?

399
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:57,249
izabeth's my friend,
and you're playingith her!

400
00:15:00,786 --> 00:15:03,988
Yeah, I guess I did.

401
00:15:10,361 --> 00:15:11,795
What the hell
are you doing?

402
00:15:11,796 --> 00:15:14,396
Relax, it's Nyquil.

403
00:15:14,397 --> 00:15:16,264
You still have a cold?

404
00:15:16,265 --> 00:15:17,999
Maybe, but I don't care.

405
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,133
That's the great thing

406
00:15:19,134 --> 00:15:22,069
about Nyquil,
it's like ten-percent booze.

407
00:15:22,070 --> 00:15:24,738
I call it the nighttime
sniffling, sneezing, coughing

408
00:15:24,739 --> 00:15:27,874
so you can talk to girls
medicine.

409
00:15:27,875 --> 00:15:29,542
Are you having trouble sleeping?

410
00:15:29,543 --> 00:15:32,277
'Cause, boy, I was up all night.

411
00:15:32,278 --> 00:15:33,845
Did you get a cold, too?

412
00:15:33,846 --> 00:15:37,582
No, but I was awake all night.

413
00:15:39,351 --> 00:15:40,918
If you want,

414
00:15:40,919 --> 00:15:44,955
I can give you some of
my mom's sleeping pills.

415
00:15:44,956 --> 00:15:45,955
She won't notice
they're missing?

416
00:15:45,956 --> 00:15:48,024
She doesn't kn
she takes them.

417
00:15:49,193 --> 00:15:50,293
No, that's okay.

418
00:15:50,294 --> 00:15:53,261
It was something else
keeping me up last night.

419
00:15:53,262 --> 00:15:55,196
And again this morning.

420
00:15:55,197 --> 00:15:58,031
And... I didn't mind.

421
00:16:01,468 --> 00:16:03,469
I was up last night.

422
00:16:03,470 --> 00:16:05,370
I was up this morning.

423
00:16:05,371 --> 00:16:07,339
I didn't mind.

424
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:09,541
Those are your clues.

425
00:16:12,411 --> 00:16:14,044
Ooh, ooh.

426
00:16:14,045 --> 00:16:17,047
Did the pigeon on your
windowsill have more babies?

427
00:16:17,048 --> 00:16:18,781
No.

428
00:16:18,782 --> 00:16:21,450
Were you up mang another
stop-motion Legoovie?

429
00:16:21,451 --> 00:16:22,918
No.

430
00:16:22,919 --> 00:16:24,219
'Cause let me tell you,

431
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:25,754
it's not enough
to make the Legos move,

432
00:16:25,755 --> 00:16:27,956
they also have to capture
your heart.

433
00:16:27,957 --> 00:16:29,991
Okay, I'll give you
one more clue.

434
00:16:29,992 --> 00:16:32,426
It involved another person.

435
00:16:32,427 --> 00:16:35,662
did you get a Japanese
love pillow?

436
00:16:36,798 --> 00:16:39,899
How is a Japanese love
pillow another person?

437
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:43,569
It is if you love her
and give her a name.

438
00:16:43,570 --> 00:16:47,105
Dr. Plimpton, I'd like you
to meet my colleagues--

439
00:16:47,106 --> 00:16:48,773
Dr. Rajesh Koothrappali

440
00:16:48,774 --> 00:16:50,842
Hi.
and not-a-doctor
Howard Wolowitz.

441
00:16:50,843 --> 00:16:51,976
Hi.

442
00:16:51,977 --> 00:16:54,678
I'm a big fan of your work.
Thank you.

443
00:16:54,679 --> 00:16:56,280
And of course, you've already
introduced yourself

444
00:16:56,281 --> 00:16:58,883
to Dr. Hofstadter.

445
00:16:58,884 --> 00:17:00,284
Hey, you.

446
00:17:00,285 --> 00:17:01,418
Hey, you.

447
00:17:01,419 --> 00:17:04,187
Boy, I'm kind of
tuckered out.

448
00:17:04,188 --> 00:17:05,956
How are you feeling,
Elizabeth?

449
00:17:05,957 --> 00:17:07,190
You know what?

450
00:17:07,191 --> 00:17:08,592
I am a little tired.

451
00:17:08,593 --> 00:17:11,161
Would you be a dear and
get me a cup of coffee?

452
00:17:11,162 --> 00:17:12,663
Sure.

453
00:17:12,664 --> 00:17:13,998
Black, right?

454
00:17:13,999 --> 00:17:17,134
Actually, now I think I want it
hot, brown and sweet.

455
00:17:18,002 --> 00:17:19,202
Coming right up.

456
00:17:24,609 --> 00:17:26,538
What?

457
00:17:26,539 --> 00:17:28,471
What do you mean "what?"
It's Halo night.

458
00:17:28,472 --> 00:17:30,104
I can't. I'm too sick.

459
00:17:30,105 --> 00:17:31,336
(coughs) Go away.

460
00:17:31,337 --> 00:17:34,839
That's why we moved
Halo night here.

461
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:36,473
Look, I brought
my mom's chicken soup.

462
00:17:36,474 --> 00:17:37,608
I'm not hungry.

463
00:17:37,609 --> 00:17:38,909
ELIZABETH:
Don't send him away.

464
00:17:38,910 --> 00:17:40,410
Let him in.
Who's that

465
00:17:40,411 --> 00:17:42,612
I bought a parrot.

466
00:17:44,948 --> 00:17:47,049
Yeah, right.

467
00:17:48,584 --> 00:17:50,051
Dr. Plimpton?

468
00:17:50,052 --> 00:17:51,586
Hi. Howard, right?

469
00:17:51,587 --> 00:17:53,254
Uh, yeah.

470
00:17:53,255 --> 00:17:55,255
Can I ask you a question,
Howard?

471
00:17:55,256 --> 00:17:57,557
Do you like role-playing games?

472
00:17:58,425 --> 00:18:01,194
Yeah, sure.

473
00:18:01,195 --> 00:18:04,296
In fact,
I'm a dungeon master.

474
00:18:04,297 --> 00:18:05,564
Not tonight.

475
00:18:05,565 --> 00:18:08,632
Tonight you are a delivery man.

476
00:18:08,633 --> 00:18:10,000
You brought soup,

477
00:18:10,001 --> 00:18:12,602
but uh-oh, Raj and I don't have
enough money to pay you.

478
00:18:12,603 --> 00:18:16,172
So we'll have to come to some
other kind of arrangement.

479
00:18:20,510 --> 00:18:22,544
Beg your pardon?

480
00:18:22,545 --> 00:18:24,312
You two figure out the details,

481
00:18:24,313 --> 00:18:25,780
I'm going to go change
into something

482
00:18:25,781 --> 00:18:29,016
I don't mind getting ripped
off my milky flesh.

483
00:18:29,851 --> 00:18:31,084
(door closes)

484
00:18:31,085 --> 00:18:33,286
What the frak?

485
00:18:33,287 --> 00:18:34,787
Go away.

486
00:18:34,788 --> 00:18:37,556
She wants New Delhi,
not Kosher deli.

487
00:18:37,557 --> 00:18:39,957
Besides, you have
a girlfriend.

488
00:18:39,958 --> 00:18:41,593
We broke up weeks ago.

489
00:18:41,594 --> 00:18:43,594
Why didn't you
say anything?

490
00:18:43,595 --> 00:18:45,062
I was waiting
for the right time.

491
00:18:45,063 --> 00:18:46,463
This is the right time.

492
00:18:47,431 --> 00:18:49,199
Hey, who's ready
for Halo?

493
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,666
Oh, this is like
a nightmare.

494
00:18:50,667 --> 00:18:52,969
Get lost!

495
00:18:52,970 --> 00:18:55,304
He's right. The numbers are
shaky enough as it is.

496
00:18:55,305 --> 00:18:56,772
I don't understand.

497
00:18:56,773 --> 00:18:58,074
(gasps)
Oh, good.

498
00:18:58,075 --> 00:18:59,642
Leonard's here.

499
00:18:59,643 --> 00:19:01,210
Good?!

500
00:19:01,211 --> 00:19:02,377
Elizabeth?

501
00:19:02,378 --> 00:19:03,712
What's going on?

502
00:19:03,713 --> 00:19:07,048
What's going on is you
and Howard are my moving men

503
00:19:07,049 --> 00:19:08,682
and Raj is my new landlord

504
00:19:08,683 --> 00:19:11,517
and I don't have enough money
to pay any of you.

505
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:16,856
Is she suggesting
what I think she's suggesting?

506
00:19:16,857 --> 00:19:17,790
Yep.

507
00:19:17,791 --> 00:19:20,493
Welcome to the
<i>Penthouse Forum.</i>

508
00:19:20,494 --> 00:19:22,527
Okay, show of hands.
Who's up for this?

509
00:19:23,529 --> 00:19:25,931
We'll all be naked
in front of each other.

510
00:19:25,932 --> 00:19:28,666
I'm out.

511
00:19:28,667 --> 00:19:30,301
Everybody ready?

512
00:19:31,403 --> 00:19:32,870
(whispering): Follow my lead.

513
00:19:32,871 --> 00:19:34,672
Almost.

514
00:19:34,673 --> 00:19:35,640
We're, we're going
to go out

515
00:19:35,641 --> 00:19:36,841
into the hallway and, uh,

516
00:19:36,842 --> 00:19:38,208
make a dramatic entrance.

517
00:19:38,209 --> 00:19:41,008
Oh, good. It's so much better
when everyone commits.

518
00:19:41,009 --> 00:19:42,974
Run. Run, run, run.
Don't look back.

519
00:19:42,975 --> 00:19:45,175
I thought we had
something special.

520
00:19:50,247 --> 00:19:52,648
So, you say
you can't pay your rent...

521
00:20:01,584 --> 00:20:02,317
Oh, Leonard?

522
00:20:02,374 --> 00:20:02,874
Hey.

523
00:20:02,959 --> 00:20:04,292
I found these in the dryer.

524
00:20:04,293 --> 00:20:06,627
I'm assuming
they belong to Sheldon.

525
00:20:06,628 --> 00:20:08,095
Thanks.

526
00:20:08,096 --> 00:20:11,164
It's really hard to find these
in his size.

527
00:20:12,033 --> 00:20:13,500
So, listen.

528
00:20:13,501 --> 00:20:16,435
I've been meaning to talk to you
about the other morning.

529
00:20:16,436 --> 00:20:19,538
You mean you and
Dr. Slutbunny?

530
00:20:19,539 --> 00:20:21,806
Yeah, I wanted
to explain

531
00:20:21,807 --> 00:20:23,841
Well, you don't owe me
an explanation.

532
00:20:23,842 --> 00:20:24,876
I don't?

533
00:20:24,877 --> 00:20:26,110
No, you don't.

534
00:20:26,111 --> 00:20:27,878
So you're not
judging me?

535
00:20:27,879 --> 00:20:29,880
Oh, I'm judging you
nine ways to Sunday,

536
00:20:29,881 --> 00:20:33,149
but you don't owe me
an explanation.

537
00:20:33,150 --> 00:20:35,551
