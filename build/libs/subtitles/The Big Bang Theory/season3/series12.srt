1
00:00:04,462 --> 00:00:08,007
Look at us, getting ready
for a double date with actual women...

2
00:00:08,174 --> 00:00:11,510
...who publicly acknowledge
they're our girlfriends.

3
00:00:11,678 --> 00:00:15,180
Yes. I mean,
actual women are the best.

4
00:00:15,348 --> 00:00:18,767
I don't understand.
What other kind of women are there?

5
00:00:18,935 --> 00:00:22,604
Artificial women are your department.
You wanna take this?

6
00:00:24,232 --> 00:00:26,692
No, it would just freak him out.

7
00:00:28,111 --> 00:00:30,529
Listen, before we leave,
I should warn you...

8
00:00:30,697 --> 00:00:32,197
...I'm a passionate man...

9
00:00:32,365 --> 00:00:35,743
...and I tend towards
public displays of affection.

10
00:00:36,661 --> 00:00:39,246
What are you trying to tell me, Howard?

11
00:00:39,789 --> 00:00:42,332
There might be making out
in the car or restaurant.

12
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:44,793
I don't want Bernadette
to feel uncomfortable...

13
00:00:44,961 --> 00:00:48,088
...so it would help
if you and Penny made out too.

14
00:00:49,215 --> 00:00:52,968
Don't worry, we're planning to have sex
right on the salad bar.

15
00:00:54,596 --> 00:00:56,472
Namaste, white people.

16
00:00:57,849 --> 00:00:59,558
Good news. I've rented us...

17
00:00:59,726 --> 00:01:02,227
-...the four-hour edition of Watchmen.
-Got it.

18
00:01:02,395 --> 00:01:05,647
-Seen it.
-Detailed analysis posted online.

19
00:01:06,357 --> 00:01:08,025
Then what are we gonna do tonight?

20
00:01:08,193 --> 00:01:11,111
Sorry. Howard and I are going out
with Penny and Bernadette.

21
00:01:11,279 --> 00:01:14,323
Yeah, no more carefree bachelor nights
for me and Leonard.

22
00:01:14,491 --> 00:01:17,076
These broncos have been saddled.

23
00:01:17,243 --> 00:01:19,912
[IMITATES HORSE WHINNYING]

24
00:01:22,248 --> 00:01:23,957
How did we get actual women?

25
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:27,836
Great. They get girlfriends
and they just abandon us?

26
00:01:28,004 --> 00:01:29,797
It is great, isn't it?

27
00:01:30,632 --> 00:01:32,508
We have a wonderful evening
ahead of us.

28
00:01:32,675 --> 00:01:34,009
-We do?
-Oh, yes.

29
00:01:34,177 --> 00:01:37,888
I discovered I don't have enough room
on my hard drive for a LINUX partition.

30
00:01:38,056 --> 00:01:40,849
You and I are gonna perform
a full backup, reinitialize...

31
00:01:41,017 --> 00:01:43,393
...and then reinstall
all my operating systems.

32
00:01:44,187 --> 00:01:46,897
-I don't wanna do that.
-All right.

33
00:01:47,065 --> 00:01:49,775
Well, I'm going to perform
a full backup, reinitialize...

34
00:01:49,943 --> 00:01:52,694
...and then reinstall
all my operating systems.

35
00:01:52,862 --> 00:01:54,613
Well, what about me?

36
00:01:54,781 --> 00:01:58,742
Well, I understand there are
several types of artificial women.

37
00:02:00,662 --> 00:02:02,204
Maybe you should look into that.

39
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:32,484
Dude, there are so many cool things
we could be doing tonight. Look.

40
00:02:32,694 --> 00:02:36,071
At the Glendale Galleria:
"Put on your best zoot suit.

41
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:37,739
It's a salute to swing music...

42
00:02:37,907 --> 00:02:40,409
...in the center court near Macy's,
5 p.m. to 9 p.m."

43
00:02:40,577 --> 00:02:42,494
Huh? Huh?

44
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:44,746
A salute to zoot.

45
00:02:45,206 --> 00:02:47,833
-Sounds like a hoot.
-I'm sorry, Raj.

46
00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:51,003
I have no desire
to salute any article of clothing tonight...

47
00:02:51,212 --> 00:02:54,840
...much less one that's linked
to race riots in the 1940s.

48
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:56,508
Race riots?

49
00:02:56,676 --> 00:02:58,302
The Zoot Suit Riots.

50
00:02:58,887 --> 00:03:00,846
Oh.

51
00:03:01,014 --> 00:03:05,142
I always thought that was
some sort of after-Christmas sale.

52
00:03:06,728 --> 00:03:09,104
Why don't we go to the galleria
and walk around?

53
00:03:09,272 --> 00:03:12,774
I don't need anything at the galleria.
You need anything at the galleria?

54
00:03:12,942 --> 00:03:15,694
No, we would just walk around
and see what's what.

55
00:03:16,863 --> 00:03:20,115
That's a semantically null sentence.

56
00:03:20,283 --> 00:03:24,119
Okay, well, how about this?
From the university website:

57
00:03:24,287 --> 00:03:27,539
"Seven p.m. to 10 p.m.,
Norton Hall Multipurpose Room...

58
00:03:27,707 --> 00:03:29,958
...mixer for grad students
and faculty...

59
00:03:30,126 --> 00:03:32,461
...of the Science
and Humanities Departments.

60
00:03:32,629 --> 00:03:37,549
Whether you split atoms or infinitives,
this is the place to be."

61
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:40,552
Well, that's certainly amusing...

62
00:03:41,387 --> 00:03:42,846
...but I have no interest.

63
00:03:43,264 --> 00:03:44,306
Come on, Sheldon.

64
00:03:44,474 --> 00:03:46,975
The world is filled with people
doing things outside.

65
00:03:47,143 --> 00:03:49,811
Let's go outside. Outside is good.

66
00:03:49,979 --> 00:03:51,521
If outside is so good...

67
00:03:51,689 --> 00:03:55,400
...why has mankind spent thousands
of years trying to perfect inside?

68
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:58,570
I don't know. It's a marketing scheme.

69
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:02,407
Please, Sheldon, I'm a young,
virile visitor from a foreign land...

70
00:04:02,575 --> 00:04:05,911
...and I need to strut my stuff.

71
00:04:06,371 --> 00:04:08,163
Let me offer you a compromise.

72
00:04:08,331 --> 00:04:12,042
Sometimes when I feel stifled
and want a change of scenery...

73
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:14,836
...I use my imagination.

74
00:04:15,004 --> 00:04:16,046
Oh, boy.

75
00:04:16,214 --> 00:04:19,591
One of my favorite places to visit
is the two-dimensional world...

76
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:23,553
...described in Edwin Abbott's
mathematical fantasy Flatland.

77
00:04:24,347 --> 00:04:26,181
I don't wanna go to Flatland.

78
00:04:26,349 --> 00:04:29,518
You're only saying that
because you haven't been there.

79
00:04:31,312 --> 00:04:34,856
I am now a hexagon
in two-dimensional space...

80
00:04:35,024 --> 00:04:38,193
...and can only perceive the edges
of other objects.

81
00:04:38,403 --> 00:04:39,903
Oy.

82
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:44,700
Is that you, Raj?
I don't recognize your edge.

83
00:04:45,535 --> 00:04:46,785
Sheldon, I'm begging you.

84
00:04:46,953 --> 00:04:49,913
I want to go to this mixer,
and I don't want to go alone.

85
00:04:50,081 --> 00:04:54,835
Well, you're in luck.
There's a mixer here in Flatland.

86
00:04:56,546 --> 00:04:57,587
Oh, look.

87
00:04:57,755 --> 00:05:01,591
There's a sexually attractive
line segment.

88
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:02,926
-Chat her up.
-What?

89
00:05:03,094 --> 00:05:07,055
Tell her you're a circle.
Flatland gals are all hot for circles.

90
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:13,061
I hope you're hungry.
We're going to a terrific restaurant.

91
00:05:13,229 --> 00:05:16,148
Oh, yeah, I'm starved.
When you spend all day in a bio lab...

92
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:18,984
...watching flesh-eating bacteria
skeletonize rodents...

93
00:05:19,152 --> 00:05:21,737
...it really works up an appetite.

94
00:05:22,572 --> 00:05:25,741
Flesh-eating bacteria
and yet I still wanna kiss this woman.

95
00:05:25,908 --> 00:05:27,075
What does that tell you?

96
00:05:27,243 --> 00:05:32,122
You'd be willing to die a horrible death on
the off chance you'd get to second base.

97
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:35,292
We're way past second base.
Right, Howard?

98
00:05:35,877 --> 00:05:40,172
Well, we kind of disagree
about what the bases are.

99
00:05:41,257 --> 00:05:43,842
How's your work going, Penny?
Any acting jobs?

100
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:46,261
The last big thing I did
was this production...

101
00:05:46,429 --> 00:05:49,139
...of Diary of Anne Frank
above a bowling alley.

102
00:05:49,307 --> 00:05:52,184
But I think things
might be turning around pretty soon.

103
00:05:52,352 --> 00:05:54,269
Well, great. How come?

104
00:05:54,437 --> 00:05:56,480
Well, promise you won't
make fun of me?

105
00:05:56,647 --> 00:05:58,940
Of course.
I would never make fun of you.

106
00:05:59,942 --> 00:06:03,362
Okay, well, I went to this psychic
who told me that if I cut my hair...

107
00:06:03,529 --> 00:06:05,530
...I'm gonna get
a national commercial.

110
00:06:09,035 --> 00:06:11,703
You're getting career advice
from a psychic?

111
00:06:11,871 --> 00:06:15,290
Good job not making fun of her.

112
00:06:15,458 --> 00:06:19,169
She's not one of those phonies, okay?
She wrote a book, has her own website.

113
00:06:19,337 --> 00:06:20,837
Oh, gee, why didn't you say so?

114
00:06:21,005 --> 00:06:23,632
They don't just let anyone
have a website.

115
00:06:24,133 --> 00:06:27,010
-Why are you being such a jerk?
-You're surprised?

116
00:06:27,178 --> 00:06:29,721
Your psychic didn't tell you
I was going to be a jerk?

117
00:06:30,264 --> 00:06:31,973
Heh, heh. Bite me.

118
00:06:33,643 --> 00:06:36,228
-Come on, Penny.
-Why don't you kids go ahead and chat?

119
00:06:36,437 --> 00:06:39,022
We're gonna make out back here.

120
00:06:42,068 --> 00:06:44,319
I'm sliding into third.

121
00:06:48,574 --> 00:06:49,866
Thanks for coming with me.

122
00:06:50,034 --> 00:06:53,412
Thanks for giving me your limited edition
Green Lantern lantern.

123
00:06:54,038 --> 00:06:55,997
Did you really have to bring it
with you?

124
00:06:56,165 --> 00:06:59,960
What if evil strikes
and my power ring runs low?

125
00:07:03,589 --> 00:07:05,674
-Come on, let's get a drink.
-I don't drink.

126
00:07:05,842 --> 00:07:06,883
Well, I do.

127
00:07:07,051 --> 00:07:11,596
And when my wingman is carrying
a Green Lantern lantern, I drink a lot.

128
00:07:11,764 --> 00:07:15,434
I'll have a screwdriver, please.
And don't be chintzy with the screw.

129
00:07:16,227 --> 00:07:18,103
I would like a root-beer float.

130
00:07:19,355 --> 00:07:22,774
-Sheldon, they don't have ice cream.
-They don't?

131
00:07:22,984 --> 00:07:26,862
Well, apparently these people and I
differ greatly on the definition of "party."

132
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:31,700
-He'll have a Shirley Temple.
-And don't be chintzy with the Shirley.

133
00:07:34,787 --> 00:07:39,291
-Okay, let's check out the females.
-All right.

134
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:41,376
There's a female.

135
00:07:41,544 --> 00:07:44,212
That's Professor Wilkinson's wife.
She's like 80.

136
00:07:44,797 --> 00:07:47,549
But she's female. Isn't that the game?

137
00:07:47,717 --> 00:07:50,635
-No. I'm looking for a hookup.
-Oh, yes.

138
00:07:50,803 --> 00:07:55,140
So the point of this exercise is for you
to find someone to copulate with?

139
00:07:55,308 --> 00:07:58,977
Not so loud. But ideally, yes.

140
00:08:00,563 --> 00:08:03,398
-Thanks.
-Thank you.

141
00:08:03,566 --> 00:08:05,734
And what is my function as wingman?

142
00:08:06,152 --> 00:08:08,403
-You help me run my game.
-Okay.

143
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:11,948
And what is your game?

00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:16,161
When I lie through my teeth to a woman,
you nod and agree.

Hey, that's pretty cool. What is it?

146
00:08:20,082 --> 00:08:22,918
It's a limited edition
Green Lantern lantern.

My friend is looking for someone
to copulate with.

Call me Raj.

00:08:35,431 --> 00:08:38,934
-Hey, Raj. Where are you from?
-The mysterious subcontinent of India.

00:08:39,101 --> 00:08:40,977
-Ooh. India.
-You know India?

153
00:08:41,145 --> 00:08:46,441
-I saw Slumdog Millionaire.
-Well, I'm a slumdog astrophysicist.

00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,444
I thought your father
was a gynecologist.

155
00:08:51,072 --> 00:08:52,864
I'm sorry.

156
00:08:55,701 --> 00:08:58,203

-Hello.
-Hello.

00:09:01,082 --> 00:09:04,376
Is that the limited edition

In brightest day, in darkest night,

00:09:12,843 --> 00:09:15,512
Oh, that is so awesome.

162
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:16,805
Thank you.

163
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:19,182
Have you chosen one
to copulate with?

164
00:09:31,988 --> 00:09:35,407
So, what should we talk about?

165
00:09:36,742 --> 00:09:38,410
Well, we could always learn more...

166
00:09:38,619 --> 00:09:42,247
...about why people who believe
in psychics are idiots. Leonard?

167
00:09:45,918 --> 00:09:47,919
We don't need
