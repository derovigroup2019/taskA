1
00:00:02,070 --> 00:00:02,762
Kites, ho!

2
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:06,102
ALL:
Kites, ho!

3
00:00:07,279 --> 00:00:08,262
Excuse me.

4
00:00:08,349 --> 00:00:10,096
You're misusing the word "ho."

5
00:00:11,486 --> 00:00:13,296
It's an interjection used
to call attention

6
00:00:13,375 --> 00:00:16,520
To a destination, not an object,
as in, uh, "Land, ho!"

7
00:00:16,601 --> 00:00:18,167
Or, uh, "Westward, ho!"

8
00:00:21,507 --> 00:00:22,500
ALL:
Kites, ho!

9
00:00:24,357 --> 00:00:25,943
Hey, guys.
Whatcha doin'?

10
00:00:26,455 --> 00:00:27,836
Going out to discover
electricity?

11
00:00:29,802 --> 00:00:31,501
If you're referring to the work
of Benjamin Franklin,

12
00:00:31,557 --> 00:00:33,448
He did not
"discover electricity,"

13
00:00:33,546 --> 00:00:35,060
He merely used a kite
to determine

14
00:00:35,166 --> 00:00:37,109
That lightning "consists"
of electricity.

15
00:00:37,665 --> 00:00:39,098
Also invented
the Franklin stove,

16
00:00:39,177 --> 00:00:41,387
Bifocals and the flexie
urinary catheter.

17
00:00:45,339 --> 00:00:46,152
Kites, ho.

18
00:00:47,846 --> 00:00:49,219
We're heading out
for some kite fighting.

19
00:00:49,322 --> 00:00:50,845
"Kite ghting"?
Oh, yeah.

20
00:00:50,941 --> 00:00:53,377
It's an extremely competitive,
cutthrt sport.

21
00:00:54,698 --> 00:00:57,533
Well, actually, the risk of
throat cutting is very low.

22
00:00:58,497 --> 00:01:00,496
On the other hand,
severe string burn is a real

23
00:01:00,596 --> 00:01:01,936
And ever-Present danger.

24
00:01:03,606 --> 00:01:04,879
You want to come watch?

25
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:06,706
, gee...

26
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:08,288
Sounds amazing.

27
00:01:08,368 --> 00:01:10,543
But, um, I've got some
friends coming over.

28
00:01:10,629 --> 00:01:11,783
Not a big thing--
We're just

29
00:01:11,838 --> 00:01:12,982
Gonna watch the Nebraska game.

30
00:01:13,047 --> 00:01:14,914
Oh. Football, sure.

31
00:01:15,256 --> 00:01:16,334
(Sotto ve):
Good guess.

32
00:01:19,152 --> 00:01:21,118
I would've invited you, but I
know you're not a footbl fan.

33
00:01:21,194 --> 00:01:23,672
, no, I'm not, so... great.

34
00:01:24,401 --> 00:01:25,169
You've got plans

35
00:01:25,259 --> 00:01:27,114
Doing something you like,
I've got plans

36
00:01:27,193 --> 00:01:28,855
Doing something I like,
so 's good.

37
00:01:28,942 --> 00:01:30,448
Well, maybe we'll hang out
later--

38
00:01:30,527 --> 00:01:31,572
You know,
after everybody's gone.

39
00:01:31,653 --> 00:01:32,480
Yeah, great.

40
00:01:33,212 --> 00:01:34,217
See ya.

41
00:01:38,575 --> 00:01:39,474
Well, this sucks.

42
00:01:41,410 --> 00:01:43,375
I'm sorry, I got bored
and drifted off.

43
00:01:46,075 --> 00:01:48,418
Where exactly in the interaction
did the sucking lie?

44
00:01:50,074 --> 00:01:52,224
Leonard just realized that
Penny's been hiding him

45
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:53,884
From her friends
because he's a tiny, little man

46
00:01:53,953 --> 00:01:55,065
Who flies kites.

47
00:01:57,264 --> 00:01:58,611
Oh, that certainly would suck.

48
00:02:00,736 --> 00:02:03,756
* Our whole universe
was in a hot, dense state *

56
00:02:28,502 --> 00:02:30,047
Wolowitz is trying
to outflank us.

57
00:02:30,113 --> 00:02:32,130
Let out some string,
add altitude

58
00:02:32,204 --> 00:02:33,607
And I'll go under
and cut his line.

59
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:36,397
Why wouldn't Penny want
her friends to meet me?

60
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,175
Focus, Leonard, focus!

61
00:02:38,252 --> 00:02:39,683
The heat of battle is upon us.

62
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:41,181
The dogs of war are unleashed.

63
00:02:42,403 --> 00:02:43,735
Maybe Koothrappali's right.

64
00:02:43,801 --> 00:02:45,008
Maybe I embarrass her.

65
00:02:45,063 --> 00:02:46,566
You're embarrassing me
right now.

66
00:02:46,652 --> 00:02:49,200
A grown man woying
about such nonsense

67
00:02:49,275 --> 00:02:50,464
When in the middle
of flying kites.

68
00:02:53,143 --> 00:02:53,793
Sorry.

69
00:02:53,882 --> 00:02:55,328
Sorry won't bring
their kites down.

70
00:02:56,151 --> 00:02:56,800
Ow!

71
00:02:56,860 --> 00:02:57,998
String burn!
String burn!

72
00:03:00,658 --> 00:03:02,559
Oh, they thinkwe're flanking

73
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,459
They're playing
righ into our hands.

74
00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:07,084
On the count of three,
we execute the flying scissor.

75
00:03:07,148 --> 00:03:08,854
One, two...

76
00:03:08,928 --> 00:03:09,967
Whoa!

77
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:11,873
Did you see that?
See what?

78
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:13,787
That chick--
She smiled at me.

79
00:03:13,956 --> 00:03:15,128
No, she didn't.
Yes, she did.

80
00:03:15,206 --> 00:03:16,490
Come on,
scissors, scissors!

81
00:03:16,557 --> 00:03:18,109
Hold my line.
Wait.

82
00:03:18,174 --> 00:03:18,895
What are you doing?

83
00:03:18,952 --> 00:03:20,201
I can't scissors by myself!
Howard!

84
00:03:20,257 --> 00:03:21,404
Come back!

85
00:03:22,390 --> 00:03:23,818
SHELDON:
Victory!

86
00:03:24,791 --> 00:03:26,446
Son of a bitch.

87
00:03:29,907 --> 00:03:31,492
You're a sucky friend,
you know that?

88
00:03:32,514 --> 00:03:33,876
<i>A sucky, sucky friend.</i>

89
00:03:34,852 --> 00:03:36,242
What was supposed to do?

90
00:03:36,316 --> 00:03:38,328
She gave me that
"come-Hither" look.

91
00:03:39,102 --> 00:03:41,291
If she gave you
any look at l. It
was a "you suck" look.

92
00:03:43,881 --> 00:03:46,649
I would've caught up to her
if I hadn't pulled a hammy.

93
00:03:46,717 --> 00:03:48,344
Oh, please,
you weh 80 pounds.

94
00:03:48,421 --> 00:03:49,592
You don't have a hammy.

95
00:03:50,995 --> 00:03:52,736
So, Penny doesn't want
around her friends.

96
00:03:52,801 --> 00:03:54,310
I embarrass her.
Whatlse could it be?

97
00:03:54,912 --> 00:03:56,825
Well, her actions

98
00:03:56,905 --> 00:03:58,638
Could be out of concernfor your feelings

99
00:03:59,235 --> 00:04:01,336
Perhaps she's excluded you
from these gatherings

100
00:04:01,425 --> 00:04:03,181
Because she's scouting
for a new mate

101
00:04:03,273 --> 00:04:04,732
And don't want to do it
in front of you.

102
00:04:06,387 --> 00:04:08,704
Oh... how kind of her.

103
00:04:09,492 --> 00:04:10,351
Agreed.

104
00:04:10,426 --> 00:04:12,576
Most primates don't show
that sort of discretion.

105
00:04:12,690 --> 00:04:16,704
A female bonobo will
copulate with a new male
front of the old one

106
00:04:16,774 --> 00:04:18,374
Without so much
as a "hodo you do?"

107
00:04:19,655 --> 00:04:20,939
You always do this,
you know?

108
00:04:21,029 --> 00:04:23,060
You ditch me for a woman
u don't have a shot with.

109
00:04:23,124 --> 00:04:25,066
I totally had a shot.
With a woman

110
00:04:25,148 --> 00:04:26,329
You were chasi
through a park--

111
00:04:26,396 --> 00:04:27,914
That's not a shot,
that's a felony.

112
00:04:30,314 --> 00:04:36,112
What's worse, it cost me
my prized Patang fighting kite.
Sheldon, I don't suppose

113
00:04:36,172 --> 00:04:38,021
There's any chance you
could give me my kite back?

114
00:04:38,078 --> 00:04:41,074
I'm sorry, Raj, but
the rules of aerial warfare

115
00:04:41,154 --> 00:04:43,568
Dictate at the fallen
kite go to the victor.

116
00:04:43,633 --> 00:04:46,142
And without rules,
the competition has no meaning.

117
00:04:46,234 --> 00:04:47,501
And without meaning,

118
00:04:47,587 --> 00:04:49,250
The following would
be an empty gesture.

119
00:04:49,859 --> 00:04:52,864
(Tauing):
I have your kite.
I have your kite.

120
00:05:00,557 --> 00:05:01,755
(Knocking at door)

121
00:05:02,433 --> 00:05:03,457
Hey.
Hi.

122
00:05:03,539 --> 00:05:04,978
How was your football party?

123
00:05:05,061 --> 00:05:06,926
It was prettgood.
We won.
Oh, wow.

124
00:05:06,987 --> 00:05:08,056
That's excellent.

125
00:05:08,589 --> 00:05:10,455
It's a weird figure of speech,
isn't it

126
00:05:10,558 --> 00:05:12,356
"We won" when you weren't
actually playing.

127
00:05:14,332 --> 00:05:15,389
<i>When we watch Star Wars,</i>

128
00:05:15,477 --> 00:05:17,128
We don't say,
"We defeated the Empire."

129
00:05:19,411 --> 00:05:22,194
I'm glad to hear it.
Yeah.

130
00:05:22,311 --> 00:05:23,793
Oh, hey, on a related subject,

131
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:25,586
Are you embarrassed
to have me around your friends?

132
00:05:27,772 --> 00:05:29,010
Oh, my god, no.

133
00:05:29,534 --> 00:05:30,658
Why would you ask that?

134
00:05:30,735 --> 00:05:32,476
Well, you know, I just noticed

135
00:05:32,532 --> 00:05:34,930
Sure you have.N't really
met any of them.Well...

136
00:05:35,550 --> 00:05:38,338
Yeah, no, I met
the huge ex-Boyfriend

137
00:05:38,421 --> 00:05:45,281
And the smBy the way,till larger
were they here today?

138
00:05:45,865 --> 00:05:46,923
Of course not.
Of course not.

139
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,276
Why would they be?
Whwould I ask?

140
00:05:48,364 --> 00:05:49,917
Why am I rambling?
Why don't you stop me?

141
00:05:51,528 --> 00:05:52,475
Leonard, look,

142
00:05:52,535 --> 00:05:54,433
If you want to meet my friends,
that would be great.

143
00:05:54,523 --> 00:05:56,918
I just, you know, I didn't
want you to be bored.

144
00:05:57,850 --> 00:05:58,762
I wouldn't be bored.

145
00:05:58,852 --> 00:06:00,515
Why would I be bored?
Well,

146
00:06:00,635 --> 00:06:02,300
'Cause they're
not genius scientists.

147
00:06:03,216 --> 00:06:05,085
Penny, I like all
sorts of people.

148
00:06:05,164 --> 00:06:07,172
In fact, some ofmy best friends
aren't geniuses.

149
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:10,584
Like who?

150
00:06:14,065 --> 00:06:16,601
Okay, some of my Facebook
friends aren't geniuses.

151
00:06:17,691 --> 00:06:20,117
My point is, if we're
going to be a couple,

152
00:06:20,204 --> 00:06:22,110
I should be friends
with your friends.

153
00:06:22,190 --> 00:06:24,130
Okay, great.
Well, then why don't you

154
00:06:24,184 --> 00:06:25,839
Come over next Saturday
and watch the game with us.

155
00:06:26,470 --> 00:06:27,777
Another football game?

156
00:06:28,816 --> 00:06:30,538
They have them every week.

157
00:06:31,029 --> 00:06:31,916
Did not know that.

158
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:35,495
You wanted to meet my friends.
Sure.

159
00:06:35,561 --> 00:06:37,580
Su, just I don't know
much about football.

160
00:06:37,649 --> 00:06:39,051
Oh, that's okay--
A lot of the guys'

161
00:06:39,121 --> 00:06:40,315
Girlfries don't know football.

162
00:06:40,373 --> 00:06:42,090
They just kind of drink
and talk in the kitchen.

163
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:45,480
Great.

164
00:06:48,515 --> 00:06:50,698
(Football game playing on TV)

165
00:06:50,763 --> 00:06:52,485
Okay, a completepass.

166
00:06:53,797 --> 00:06:55,190
First down, New England.

167
00:06:57,665 --> 00:06:59,083
I think I'm starting
to get this.

168
00:06:59,707 --> 00:07:00,583
Really?

169
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:02,161
The only thing I've learned
in the last two hours

170
00:07:02,239 --> 00:07:03,819
Is that American men
love drinking beer,

171
00:07:03,883 --> 00:07:06,283
Pee too often and have
trouble getting erections.

172
00:07:11,204 --> 00:07:13,279
Focus on the game,
not the commercials, Raj.

173
00:07:14,534 --> 00:07:16,512
I'm just saying,
maybe if you people
cut back on the beer,

174
00:07:16,617 --> 00:07:20,305
You could get out of the
bathroom and satisfy your women
without pharmaceutical hp.

175
00:07:23,299 --> 00:07:24,927
J, what are you
doing here?

176
00:07:24,994 --> 00:07:26,513
You were supposed to help me
pimp outy Vespa.

177
00:07:28,381 --> 00:07:30,729
I'm sorry, are you
under the impreson
that we're still friends?

178
00:07:30,819 --> 00:07:33,359
(Groans):
Ohcome on.

179
00:07:33,939 --> 00:07:36,230
Y're not still grinding
on the kite thing, are you?

180
00:07:36,337 --> 00:07:38,005
It's not just the kite thing.

181
00:07:38,111 --> 00:07:40,364
Every time we go some place,
you think you can just dump me

182
00:07:40,434 --> 00:07:41,665
Whenever someone prettier
comes along,

183
00:07:41,752 --> 00:07:43,186
Even though you don't have
a shot with them.

184
00:07:43,337 --> 00:07:45,408
I had a shot with that jogger.

185
00:07:45,510 --> 00:07:48,819
Fine. Paint green flames
on your little scooter with her.

186
00:07:50,649 --> 00:07:52,273
It's not a little scooter.

187
00:07:52,335 --> 00:07:54,331
It's the second biggest
Vespa they make!

188
00:07:54,411 --> 00:07:55,579
(Door closes)

189
00:07:57,771 --> 00:07:59,339
Are you watching football?

190
00:07:59,923 --> 00:08:01,247
There's no fooling you.

191
00:08:03,265 --> 00:08:06,588
Now, what is this sacks
statistic they put up there?

192
00:08:06,674 --> 00:08:09,271
All I know about Saks is,
my mother shops there.

193
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:15,252
Sacks, sacks...

194
00:08:15,348 --> 00:08:16,760
SHELDON:It's football nom

195
00:08:16,815 --> 00:08:18,517
For when a quarterback
is taced

196
00:08:18,587 --> 00:08:20,012
Behind the line of scrimmage.

197
00:08:20,142 --> 00:08:21,315
Huh...

198
00:08:23,937 --> 00:08:25,040
Scrimmage.

199
00:08:27,242 --> 00:08:28,165
SHELDON:
The line of scrimmage

200
00:08:28,269 --> 00:08:30,012
Is the imaginary transverse line

201
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:31,951
Separating the offense
from the defense.

202
00:08:33,105 --> 00:08:33,912
Oh.

203
00:08:35,318 --> 00:08:37,266
Sheln knows football?

204
00:08:37,898 --> 00:08:39,055
Apparently.

205
00:08:39,181 --> 00:08:41,920
I mean, Quidditch, sure.
But football?

206
00:08:45,206 --> 00:08:46,578
Sheldon, how do you
know this stuff?

207
00:08:46,665 --> 00:08:48,022
I grew up in Texas.

208
00:08:48,142 --> 00:08:49,809
Football is ubiquitous in Texas:

209
00:08:50,497 --> 00:08:52,103
Pro football,
college football,

210
00:08:52,186 --> 00:08:54,097
High school football,
peewee football...

211
00:08:54,189 --> 00:08:56,807
In fact, every form of football
except the original--

212
00:08:56,872 --> 00:08:58,506
Europeanootball.

213
00:08:59,533 --> 00:09:01,474
Which most Texans believe
to be a Commie plot.

214
00:09:04,155 --> 00:09:05,016
Unbeliable.

215
00:09:05,118 --> 00:09:07,321
If you're interested, Ilso
know all about frying meat

216
00:09:07,427 --> 00:09:09,274
That isn't icken
as if it were chicken.

217
00:09:13,527 --> 00:09:15,186
So you could teach me?

218
00:09:16,148 --> 00:09:18,189
Football or chicken-Fried meats?

219
00:09:20,154 --> 00:09:21,036
Football.

220
00:09:21,109 --> 00:09:23,288
I'm going to Penny's on Saturday
to watch a game with her friends

221
00:09:23,376 --> 00:09:25,698
And I don't want to look lik
an idiot. I want to blend in.

222
00:09:25,762 --> 00:09:27,538
If you want to blend in
with Penny's friends,

223
00:09:27,637 --> 00:09:29,799
I'd think looking ke an idiot
would be the perfect camouflage.

224
00:09:31,611 --> 00:09:33,892
Come on, Sheldon, please teach
me about football. It'll be fun.

225
00:09:34,010 --> 00:09:36,387
That's exactly
what my father said.

226
00:09:37,297 --> 00:09:39,128
"Come to the games.
watch the games."

227
00:09:39,224 --> 00:09:41,112
Week in and week out
from the time

228
00:09:41,176 --> 00:09:42,795
I was five
until I went off to college.

229
00:09:43,495 --> 00:09:45,156
Longesseven years of my life.

230
00:09:47,092 --> 00:09:48,728
Please, I'm asking you
as a friend.

231
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:53,548
Are you making this a tier one
friendship request?

232
00:09:57,571 --> 00:09:58,622
(Sighs):
Fine.

233
00:09:59,158 --> 00:10:01,232
I really appreciate this.
Yeah, yeah.

234
00:10:01,335 --> 00:10:03,510
All right, Poindexter,
sit wn, shut up and listen.

235
00:10:06,257 --> 00:10:06,993
I'm sorry?

236
00:10:07,093 --> 00:10:08,597
That's how my father
always began

237
00:10:08,665 --> 00:10:10,036
Our football conversations.

238
00:10:11,081 --> 00:10:11,887
And if you'd like,

239
00:10:11,965 --> 00:10:12,959
After the game,

240
00:10:40,623 --> 00:10:42,764
When are you going to stop
making Con toast?

241
00:10:44,402 --> 00:10:46,615
When I have enough to destroy
all the human toast

242
00:10:46,668 --> 00:10:48,617
On the battlestar
known asGalactica.

243
00:10:51,712 --> 00:10:53,327
Is that what you're wearing
to watch football at Penny's?

244
00:10:54,235 --> 00:10:55,714
What's wrong
with a football jersey?

245
00:10:55,823 --> 00:10:59,100
Nothing. That, however, appears
to be a football cocktail dress.

246
00:11:03,010 --> 00:11:04,611
I's the smallest size they had,

247
00:11:05,199 --> 00:11:06,347
Except the one for dogs.

248
00:11:08,258 --> 00:11:09,803
I can't believe
they had one for dogs.

249
00:11:10,747 --> 00:11:11,451
Oh, yes.

250
00:11:11,545 --> 00:11:13,956
Canine football fans
are a common sight in Texas.

251
00:11:14,507 --> 00:11:16,986
Cats, however, refuse
to wear sporting apparel.

252
00:11:18,704 --> 00:11:20,528
My sister found that out
the hard way.

253
00:11:22,089 --> 00:11:23,195
Anyway, wish me luck.

254
00:11:23,282 --> 00:11:24,350
Leonard, wait.

255
00:11:24,442 --> 00:11:28,265
Am I correct in assuminghat
your attempt to be accepted

256
00:11:31,699 --> 00:11:34,101
To ensure your continuing
mating privileges with her?

257
00:11:36,516 --> 00:11:38,399
Well, I wouldn't put it
exactly that way

258
00:11:39,130 --> 00:11:40,405
How would you put it?

259
00:11:41,724 --> 00:11:42,911
Yeah, okay, like you said.

260
00:11:45,504 --> 00:11:47,056
Huh. Seems like an awful
lot of trouble

261
00:11:47,127 --> 00:11:48,512
To go through for intercourse.

262
00:11:50,383 --> 00:11:52,879
Don't you have access to women
who will do it for money?

263
00:11:58,272 --> 00:12:00,381
Another accepted usage
for the term "ho."

264
00:12:03,463 --> 00:12:04,588
Good-Bye, Sheldon.

265
00:12:06,097 --> 00:12:07,123
Hold on

266
00:12:07,182 --> 00:12:08,433
I believe that
social convention

267
00:12:08,504 --> 00:12:10,278
Dictate you not arrive
empty-Handed.

268
00:12:10,209 --> 00:12:12,207
Would you like to bring
some Cylon toast?

269
00:12:13,816 --> 00:12:16,320
Yeah, no, I'm trying to fit in,
not get laughed at.

270
00:12:19,345 --> 00:12:20,222
(Door closes)

271
00:12:21,122 --> 00:12:22,735
What's funny about Cylon toast?

272
00:12:28,288 --> 00:12:29,125
It's open.

273
00:12:30,729 --> 00:12:32,027
Hey, pal.

274
00:12:34,721 --> 00:12:35,859
What do you want?
(TV clicks off)

275
00:12:35,928 --> 00:12:37,707
I brought you
a little gift.

276
00:12:38,430 --> 00:12:39,855
New kite.

277
00:12:42,383 --> 00:12:44,834
The kite you made me lose
was an authentic Patang,

278
00:12:45,414 --> 00:12:46,414
Indian fighting kite

279
00:12:46,486 --> 00:12:47,866
That my brother sent to me
from New Delhi.

280
00:12:47,926 --> 00:12:50,155
It took me a day to put together
and two days to paint.

281
00:12:50,767 --> 00:12:52,577
This is Hello Kitty.

282
00:12:55,972 --> 00:12:58,448
Yeah, but it comes
with a little coin purse.

283
00:12:59,404 --> 00:13:00,955
Does a Patang?

284
00:13:02,365 --> 00:13:04,267
Wow, you just don't
get it, do you?

285
00:13:04,423 --> 00:13:06,176
Buying me something
pretty isn't going

286
00:13:06,252 --> 00:13:07,790
To make our problem
just go away.

287
00:13:09,490 --> 00:13:11,924
Look, I admit
I haven't always been

288
00:13:12,009 --> 00:13:13,474
The best friend I could be.

289
00:13:13,582 --> 00:13:15,947
<i>Y've been a sucky friend,
a sucky, sucky friend.</i>

290
00:13:17,085 --> 00:13:18,523
Stipulated.

291
00:13:18,635 --> 00:13:19,842
And you do it
all the time.

292
00:13:19,923 --> 00:13:21,669
Last week in the mall at
Radio Shack, we were looking

293
00:13:21,751 --> 00:13:23,652
For a phone with giant
numbers for your mother,

294
00:13:24,368 --> 00:13:26,554
And I suddenly realize
you're not even there.

295
00:13:26,653 --> 00:13:33,028
I know, I know...
Getting shot down by the girl
at Hot Dog on a Stick. Were you?

296
00:13:33,087 --> 00:13:34,732
But in my defense,
she was gorgeous!

297
00:13:34,819 --> 00:13:36,929
And working that squeezer
to make the lemonade,

298
00:13:37,028 --> 00:13:39,489
Going  and down
and up and down.

299
00:13:40,885 --> 00:13:42,252
It was like
a free pole dance

300
00:13:42,302 --> 00:13:43,916
Right in the middle
of the food court.

301
00:13:45,632 --> 00:13:46,670
You're impossible.

302
00:13:47,210 --> 00:13:49,240
Hey, at least I can
talk to women

303
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:50,556
Without being drunk.

304
00:13:50,886 --> 00:13:52,934
Excuse me,
I have selective mutism,

305
00:13:52,996 --> 00:13:54,619
A recognized medical disorder.

306
00:13:55,165 --> 00:13:56,413
You're just a douche.

307
00:13:58,707 --> 00:13:59,691
No. You know what?

308
00:13:59,763 --> 00:14:01,958
Maybe that's what
this whole thing's about.

309
00:14:02,019 --> 00:14:02,995
You're not mad at me,

310
00:14:03,057 --> 00:14:04,410
You're mad at yourself.

311
00:14:04,479 --> 00:14:05,558
No, I'm mad at you.

312
00:14:05,657 --> 00:14:07,456
I hate myself,
but I'm mad at you.

313
00:14:08,856 --> 00:14:10,218
Fine. You're mad at me.
I get it.

314
00:14:10,799 --> 00:14:13,389
How about we go
spend the day together?

315
00:14:15,193 --> 00:14:16,401
Just the two of us.

316
00:14:16,456 --> 00:14:17,785
We'll go anywhere you want.

317
00:14:19,478 --> 00:14:20,633
I don't know.

318
00:14:21,297 --> 00:14:22,249
Come on.

319
00:14:23,536 --> 00:14:24,887
Let me take you someplace nice.

320
00:14:30,331 --> 00:14:32,643
I-I do enjoy
the La Brea Tar Pits.

321
00:14:34,708 --> 00:14:37,512
Really, now? With the traffic
and the parking?

322
00:14:38,048 --> 00:14:39,049
Okay, fine.

323
00:14:39,876 --> 00:14:41,022
The Tar Pits.
Let's go.

324
00:14:46,859 --> 00:14:48,611
Oh, why can't I stay mad at you?

325
00:14:48,697 --> 00:14:49,988
(Exclaims)

326
00:14:53,277 --> 00:14:56,048
Go! Go! Go!

327
00:14:56,127 --> 00:14:57,398
Go-Go-Go-Go! Yes!

328
00:14:57,491 --> 00:14:59,035
Are you people watching this?

329
00:14:59,099 --> 00:15:00,328
Is this amazing or what?

330
00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:02,344
Sweetie, that's a highlight

331
00:15:02,426 --> 00:15:04,024
From the '98
championship game.

332
00:15:05,149 --> 00:15:07,234
Oh. Did not know that.

333
00:15:08,546 --> 00:15:10,472
How much beer have you had?
None, why?

334
00:15:10,546 --> 00:15:13,073
Oh. I was just kind of
hoping you were drunk.

335
00:15:14,794 --> 00:15:16,286
Now we're back live.
Okay, yeah.

336
00:15:16,385 --> 00:15:17,728
I can see the difference.

337
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:21,804
Oh, where's the flag?
That's intentional grounding.

338
00:15:21,877 --> 00:15:23,804
Totally.
That completely was

339
00:15:23,859 --> 00:15:26,556
A forward pass, which they
threw intentionally incomplete

340
00:15:26,628 --> 00:15:29,070
To avoid loss of yardage
or to conserve time

341
00:15:31,137 --> 00:15:32,085
I can't believe they're not

342
00:15:32,151 --> 00:15:33,971
Being penalized
with the loss of a down

343
00:15:34,025 --> 00:15:35,923
And by having to move the line
of scrimmage

344
00:15:35,992 --> 00:15:37,526
Back to the spot of the foul.

345
00:15:41,350 --> 00:15:43,147
Here, have some pizza, sweetie.

346
00:15:43,233 --> 00:15:45,254
Penny, you know
I'm lactose intolerant.

347
00:15:45,575 --> 00:15:47,034
I know. I just need you
stop talking.

348
00:15:49,094 --> 00:15:50,024
(Knocking)
SHELDON:
Penny.

349
00:15:50,084 --> 00:15:52,032
Penny. Penny.

350
00:15:53,771 --> 00:15:55,748
Sheldon, come in.
Thank you.

351
00:15:55,834 --> 00:15:58,263
I'd like to make a sandwich,
but I'm out of bread.

352
00:16:00,699 --> 00:16:02,008
There's some
in the fridge.

353
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:04,505
You shouldn't keep your bread
in the refrigerator.

354
00:16:04,593 --> 00:16:06,208
Staleness is caused
by crystallization

355
00:16:06,266 --> 00:16:08,162
Of the starch molecules,
which occurs faster

356
00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:10,448
At cool temperatures.
On Earth,

357
00:16:10,517 --> 00:16:11,643
We say "thank you."

358
00:16:13,234 --> 00:16:15,873
So Leonard,
how goes the mimesis?

359
00:16:16,472 --> 00:16:17,505
"Mimesis"?

360
00:16:17,579 --> 00:16:20,175
You know. Mimesis.

361
00:16:21,417 --> 00:16:24,368
An action in which the mimic
takes on the properties

362
00:16:24,454 --> 00:16:27,083
Of a specific object
or organism.

363
00:16:27,186 --> 00:16:28,525
Mimesis.

364
00:16:31,138 --> 00:16:32,358
What the hell
are you talking about?

365
00:16:34,128 --> 00:16:35,819
I'm attempting
to communicate with you

366
00:16:35,891 --> 00:16:38,937
Without my meaning becoming
apparent to those around you.

367
00:16:39,593 --> 00:16:41,059
Let me try again.

368
00:16:42,484 --> 00:16:45,007
Have the indigenous fauna

369
00:16:45,078 --> 00:16:47,018
Accepted you as oneof their own?

370
00:16:48,893 --> 00:16:50,524
Nudge, nudge, wink, wink.

371
00:16:52,451 --> 00:16:53,451
Oh, I guess so.

372
00:16:53,530 --> 00:16:55,618
Good. Oh, FYI.

373
00:16:55,679 --> 00:16:58,277
After I eat my sandwich,
I'm taking Koothrappali's

374
00:16:58,334 --> 00:17:00,155
Patang kite
out for a test run.

375
00:17:00,247 --> 00:17:02,856
Would you like to get your
delta-Wing raptor and join me?

376
00:17:02,953 --> 00:17:04,769
I don't want to fly kites,
Sheldon.

377
00:17:04,821 --> 00:17:06,136
We're watching football here.

378
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:08,001
I can see that.

379
00:17:08,081 --> 00:17:09,905
I was providing you
with an alternative.

380
00:17:10,925 --> 00:17:14,561
A courtesy I was never offered
in similar circumstances.

381
00:17:16,737 --> 00:17:17,629
(Whistle blows on TV)

382
00:17:17,704 --> 00:17:18,702
Oh, look at that.

383
00:17:18,804 --> 00:17:22,531
Indicating he's challenging
the ruling on the field.

384
00:17:23,722 --> 00:17:25,100
I hope he's right, 'cause if
he'not, it'll cost him

385
00:17:25,183 --> 00:17:26,448
One of his three time-Outs.

386
00:17:33,019 --> 00:17:33,992
You know, Leonard, honey,

387
00:17:34,587 --> 00:17:38,356
I wouldn't mind if you wanted
to go fly kites with Sheldon.

388
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:40,219
No, I'll watch the
end of the game.

389
00:17:40,272 --> 00:17:41,505
Besides, there's only
three minutes left.

390
00:17:41,569 --> 00:17:43,186
Until halftime.

391
00:17:43,263 --> 00:17:44,694
This is just half?

392
00:17:46,113 --> 00:17:47,369
We've been here for hours.

393
00:17:47,465 --> 00:17:49,189
And you're gonna be here
for a couple more.

394
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:50,589
Oh, you're kidding me.
No.

395
00:17:50,660 --> 00:17:51,935
Nice meeting all of you.

396
00:17:55,272 --> 00:17:57,590
So, yeah, anyway,
that's my boyfriend.

397
00:18:10,392 --> 00:18:11,982
I really like my
saber-Toothed cat.

398
00:18:12,038 --> 00:18:12,944
Thank you.

399
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:14,510
My pleasure.

400
00:18:15,093 --> 00:18:17,290
Maybe after lunch,
we can go to Marie Callender's

401
00:18:17,367 --> 00:18:18,738
And have some pie.

402
00:18:19,642 --> 00:18:20,211
I'd like that.

403
00:18:21,776 --> 00:18:23,338
(Takes deep breath)

404
00:18:23,421 --> 00:18:25,180
This is turning out
to be a perfect Saturday.

405
00:18:25,730 --> 00:18:27,053
Good. I'm glad.

406
00:18:30,291 --> 00:18:32,305
Oh, man. Did you see
the way she smiled at me?

407
00:18:34,517 --> 00:18:35,612
Fine. Go ahead.

408
00:18:36,185 --> 00:18:38,071
No. This is our day.

409
00:18:38,119 --> 00:18:39,495
If you want
to chase after her,

410
00:18:39,563 --> 00:18:40,652
Chase after her.

411
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:45,374
Ah, who am I kidding?
I wouldn't have a shot
with a girl like that.

412
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:46,662
Don't put yourself down.

413
00:18:46,714 --> 00:18:48,013
You're a very attractive man.

414
00:18:48,489 --> 00:18:49,946
You think so?
Yeah.

415
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,451
Absolutely.
It wouldn't kill you

416
00:18:51,513 --> 00:18:53,185
To take a Pilates clas
with me now and then,

417
00:18:53,268 --> 00:18:54,589
But you have acertain

418
00:18:56,557 --> 00:18:58,002
Yeah, well,
it doesn't matter

419
00:18:58,060 --> 00:18:59,893
'Cause she wasn't
really smiling at me.

420
00:19:00,451 --> 00:19:01,955
Actually, in this case,
I think she was.

421
00:19:02,532 --> 00:19:03,398
Really?

422
00:19:03,454 --> 00:19:04,895
Yeah.
Bye.

423
00:19:07,349 --> 00:19:08,672
What a douche.
