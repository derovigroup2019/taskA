1
00:00:03,234 --> 00:00:04,134
Seems like forever,

2
00:00:04,135 --> 00:00:06,436
since the four of us have
been out to eat, you know?

3
00:00:06,504 --> 00:00:07,937
Just the guys.

4
00:00:08,005 --> 00:00:09,272
Oh, God! Yes, we get it.

5
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:12,175
You have a girlfriend now.

6
00:00:12,242 --> 00:00:13,710
A little jealous, are we?

7
00:00:13,777 --> 00:00:15,030
No, I'm not jealous.

8
00:00:18,126 --> 00:00:20,637
All right, I'd kill a hobo
if it'll get me laid.

9
00:00:20,705 --> 00:00:22,106
Now, can we order?

10
00:00:22,173 --> 00:00:25,708
Oh, dear Lord,
they re-did the menu.

11
00:00:25,776 --> 00:00:27,575
So what?
It's the same food.

12
00:00:27,643 --> 00:00:29,482
Oh, is it?
Look at this.

13
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:30,719
General Tso's Chicken

14
00:00:30,787 --> 00:00:32,487
is no longer listed
under "specialties."

15
00:00:32,555 --> 00:00:34,589
It's now under "chicken."

16
00:00:34,656 --> 00:00:35,893
So?

17
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:38,596
Yes, General Tso.

18
00:00:39,698 --> 00:00:42,499
Not "Tso," the chicken,
"so" the question.

19
00:00:43,501 --> 00:00:44,567
So?

20
00:00:44,635 --> 00:00:47,268
So, why is it no longer
a specialty?

21
00:00:48,303 --> 00:00:49,569
Did the chef
lose confidence

22
00:00:49,636 --> 00:00:51,770
in the dish or himself?

23
00:00:51,838 --> 00:00:53,338
And look over here.

24
00:00:53,406 --> 00:00:57,175
"Shrimp in mobster sauce."

25
00:00:57,243 --> 00:00:59,677
What is "mobster sauce"?

26
00:00:59,745 --> 00:01:01,412
It's obviously a typo.

27
00:01:01,481 --> 00:01:03,683
Perhaps. Or perhaps
this restaurant's

28
00:01:03,751 --> 00:01:06,588
now a front for
organized crime.

29
00:01:06,656 --> 00:01:08,090
For all we know,
the mobster sauce

30
00:01:08,158 --> 00:01:11,294
contains actual chunks
of deceased mobsters.

31
00:01:11,362 --> 00:01:13,132
No, no, no, no--
I think it just means

32
00:01:13,199 --> 00:01:15,034
it's the kind of sauce
that mobsters like.

33
00:01:15,102 --> 00:01:17,270
It doesn't mean any of that!

34
00:01:17,338 --> 00:01:18,538
It's a typo.

35
00:01:18,606 --> 00:01:19,773
You know what?
Let's just get a pizza.

36
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:21,842
Good idea.
We'll go to Corleone's.

37
00:01:23,077 --> 00:01:24,911
Sure, no mobsters there.

38
00:01:27,283 --> 00:01:29,418
You know, the more
I think about it,

39
00:01:29,486 --> 00:01:31,987
the mobster sauce
couldn't possibly contain

40
00:01:32,055 --> 00:01:34,057
chunks of mobster.

41
00:01:35,492 --> 00:01:36,593
And why is that?

42
00:01:36,661 --> 00:01:38,328
It was listed
under "seafood."

43
00:01:40,767 --> 00:01:43,435
What if they were mobsters
who slept with the fishes?

44
00:01:43,503 --> 00:01:45,504
(laughing)

45
00:01:48,141 --> 00:01:50,743
Leonard, are we having a serious
conversation or not?

46
00:01:52,947 --> 00:01:54,380
LEONARD:
What the...?

47
00:02:00,521 --> 00:02:01,621
The TV is gone.

48
00:02:01,689 --> 00:02:03,423
So are our laptops.

49
00:02:03,491 --> 00:02:05,692
Oh, God.

50
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:07,527
Oh, God.

51
00:02:07,595 --> 00:02:09,596
Oh, God!

52
00:02:12,199 --> 00:02:13,399
It's all right.

53
00:02:14,701 --> 00:02:17,236
They didn't take my comic books.

54
00:02:17,304 --> 00:02:20,839
? Our whole universe
was in a hot, dense state ?

55
00:02:20,907 --> 00:02:24,143
? Then nearly 14 billion years
ago expansion started... Wait! ?

56
00:02:24,211 --> 00:02:25,812
? The Earth began to cool ?

57
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:28,515
? The autotrophs began to drool,
Neanderthals developed tools ?

58
00:02:28,582 --> 00:02:31,017
<i>? We built the Wall ?
? We built the pyramids ?</i>

59
00:02:31,085 --> 00:02:33,719
? Math, Science, History,
unraveling the mystery ?

60
00:02:33,787 --> 00:02:35,621
? That all started
with a big bang ?

00:02:44,144 --> 00:02:45,078
two laptops,

65
00:02:45,145 --> 00:02:46,212
four external hard-drives,

00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:47,780

our classic Nintendo,

00:02:50,718 --> 00:02:53,887
our Super Nintendo,
our Nintendo 64 and our Wii.

70
00:02:54,889 --> 00:02:56,223
We like games.

00:02:57,259 --> 00:02:58,926

00:02:58,994 --> 00:03:00,962

81

Assorted video games.

82
00:03:22,915 --> 00:03:25,650
When does the CSI
team get here?

83
00:03:25,718 --> 00:03:27,652
What?

84
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:29,721
In anticipation
of their arrival,

85
00:03:29,789 --> 00:03:31,656
I've bagged some evidence.

86
00:03:31,724 --> 00:03:33,458
One of the thieves
had the audacity

87
00:03:33,525 --> 00:03:35,726
to quench his thirst
while ransacking our home.

88
00:03:35,794 --> 00:03:37,895
You should be able to pull
some good prints off this.

89
00:03:37,963 --> 00:03:39,330
And now,
here are my prints

90
00:03:39,397 --> 00:03:41,932
so you can rule me out
as a suspect.

91
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,433
What about me?

92
00:03:43,501 --> 00:03:45,568
I'm sorry, Leonard.
It's too early to discount

93
00:03:45,636 --> 00:03:48,104
the possibility of this
being an inside job.

94
00:03:48,172 --> 00:03:51,608
Would I be completely
out of line to ask you
to shoot him?

95
00:03:52,943 --> 00:03:54,911
I'd be happy to put him
under a 72-hour

96
00:03:54,978 --> 00:03:56,312
psychiatric hold.

97
00:03:57,347 --> 00:03:58,847
I'm not crazy.

98
00:03:58,915 --> 00:04:01,016
My mother had me tested.

99
00:04:01,084 --> 00:04:02,417
We're done here.

100
00:04:02,485 --> 00:04:04,886
Call this number, and we'll fax
you a copy of the report

101
00:04:04,953 --> 00:04:06,354
so you can submit it
to your insurance company.

102
00:04:06,421 --> 00:04:07,855
I-I'm sorry.

103
00:04:07,923 --> 00:04:09,424
That's the end
of your inquiry?

104
00:04:09,492 --> 00:04:13,562
Do you have any more information
that might be relevant?

105
00:04:13,629 --> 00:04:15,630
Oh, my goodness.
Where do I begin? For instance--

106
00:04:15,698 --> 00:04:17,199
my laptop contained

107
00:04:17,267 --> 00:04:19,068
four out of the five
gedankenexperiments

108
00:04:19,136 --> 00:04:20,603
necessary for a cogent
restatement

109
00:04:20,671 --> 00:04:22,038
of the quantum
measurement problem.

110
00:04:22,106 --> 00:04:24,040
How is that going to help them?

111
00:04:24,108 --> 00:04:26,209
Well, they could monitor
scientific publications

112
00:04:26,277 --> 00:04:28,879
and see if anyone posts such
a cogent restatement in the next

113
00:04:28,947 --> 00:04:30,047
couple of months. If so,

114
00:04:30,114 --> 00:04:31,214
the authors are most likely

115
00:04:31,282 --> 00:04:32,916
in possession
of my stolen laptop.

116
00:04:34,452 --> 00:04:35,786
Good night, fellas.

117
00:04:37,122 --> 00:04:39,857
Come on, Bochco.

118
00:04:41,727 --> 00:04:43,095
(groans)

119
00:04:49,468 --> 00:04:52,436
What are we
supposed to do now?

120
00:04:52,504 --> 00:04:54,539
<i>The only thing we can do.</i>

121
00:04:54,606 --> 00:04:57,041
Watch TV on our phones
until the criminals return

122
00:04:57,109 --> 00:04:59,411
and bludgeon us
to death in our sleep.

123
00:04:59,478 --> 00:05:02,580
Does that mean you've ruled
me out as a suspect?

124
00:05:02,648 --> 00:05:04,382
Oh, how I wish I could.

125
00:05:11,390 --> 00:05:14,125

I do not have to urinate.

I am the master
of my own bladder.

134
00:06:08,048 --> 00:06:09,715
Drat.

135
00:06:13,252 --> 00:06:15,020
I can't believe it.

136
00:06:15,087 --> 00:06:16,788
If I hadn't been
working the dinner shift,

137
00:06:16,856 --> 00:06:18,657
I would've run
right into the robbers.

138
00:06:18,724 --> 00:06:21,026
Hey, there's no reason
for you to be scared.

139
00:06:21,094 --> 00:06:22,260
I'm not scared.

140
00:06:22,328 --> 00:06:24,496
I would've gone all Nebraska
on their asses.

SHELDON:
Leonard and Penny.

00:06:28,801 --> 00:06:29,901

Leonard and Penny.

144
00:06:29,969 --> 00:06:31,102
Hand me the bat.

145
00:06:35,374 --> 00:06:37,474
We just had a major crime
in the building,

146
00:06:37,542 --> 00:06:39,409
and you open the door
without asking who it is?

147
00:06:41,179 --> 00:06:42,712
It won't happen again.
What's up?

148
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:44,880
Nothing.

149
00:06:44,948 --> 00:06:47,082
I just wanted to see
if you were both okay.

150
00:06:47,150 --> 00:06:48,317
We're fine, Sheldon.

151
00:06:49,953 --> 00:06:51,720
All right, then.

152
00:06:51,788 --> 00:06:54,056
Good night.
Good night.

153
00:06:56,092 --> 00:06:58,426
That was weird,
even for him.
Mm-hmm.

154
00:06:58,494 --> 00:06:59,928

Leonard and Penny.

Who is it?

158
00:07:07,503 --> 00:07:09,237
Sheldon.
Sheldon Cooper.

159
00:07:10,472 --> 00:07:11,706
Yes?

160
00:07:11,774 --> 00:07:13,241
May I come in?

161
00:07:15,177 --> 00:07:17,178
Yeah.

162
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:26,821
I see you're drinking wine.

163
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:29,723
Yes, we are.

164
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:31,158
And we're about to go to bed.

165
00:07:31,226 --> 00:07:33,194
Uh-huh.

166
00:07:34,363 --> 00:07:36,330
Sheldon, do you want
to sleep here tonight?

167
00:07:36,398 --> 00:07:38,900
Oh, as small as Leonard is,

168
00:07:38,968 --> 00:07:41,536
I don't think the two of you'd
be comfortable on the couch.

169
00:07:43,373 --> 00:07:44,740
<i>What do you want?</i>

170
00:07:44,808 --> 00:07:47,776
It's not what I want,
it's what evolution wants.

171
00:07:47,845 --> 00:07:49,045
Human beings are primates.

172
00:07:49,112 --> 00:07:50,779
Primates have evolved
to live in groups,

173
00:07:50,847 --> 00:07:53,182
both for protection
and support.

174
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:55,652
But you don't like other people.

175
00:07:56,954 --> 00:07:59,656
I do tonight.

176
00:07:59,724 --> 00:08:02,259
It's scary over there.

177
00:08:02,327 --> 00:08:04,529
It's getting scary here, too.

178
00:08:12,337 --> 00:08:15,072
Um... three little kittens?

179
00:08:17,676 --> 00:08:18,742
Three little pigs?

180
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,614
(groans)

181
00:08:23,682 --> 00:08:25,348
God, I don't know.

182
00:08:25,416 --> 00:08:26,950
<i>Star Wars?</i>

183
00:08:27,017 --> 00:08:28,451
(timer dings)

184
00:08:28,519 --> 00:08:30,820
Did we win?
Can we go to bed?

185
00:08:30,887 --> 00:08:33,255
Good Lord-- I could not
have made this easier.

186
00:08:33,322 --> 00:08:35,523
Hydrogen atom, H,

187
00:08:35,591 --> 00:08:38,826
plus pigs minus pea-- Higgs.

188
00:08:38,894 --> 00:08:42,829
Bow, General Zod trapped
in the Phantom Zone.

189
00:08:43,964 --> 00:08:45,865
Bow-zone.

190
00:08:45,932 --> 00:08:48,033
Pear. Tickle.

191
00:08:48,101 --> 00:08:49,735
Pear-tickle.

192
00:08:52,139 --> 00:08:53,973
Higgs Boson Particle.

193
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:55,975
How could you not get that?

194
00:08:56,042 --> 00:08:58,477
He's right, Penny.
It's all there.

195
00:09:00,713 --> 00:09:03,315
Sheldon, sweetie, I know
you're feeling insecure,

196
00:09:03,383 --> 00:09:05,083
but we've really
got to go to sleep.

197
00:09:05,151 --> 00:09:07,920
All right.
I'll take the first watch

198
00:09:07,988 --> 00:09:09,388
and wake you at 0400.

199
00:09:09,456 --> 00:09:10,823
Great. Good night.

200
00:09:10,891 --> 00:09:12,458
Wait, wait--
what's 0400?

201
00:09:12,526 --> 00:09:14,727
4:00 a.m.
That's, like,
in 45 minutes.

202
00:09:14,795 --> 00:09:16,096
Just keep walking.

203
00:09:35,584 --> 00:09:37,018
WOMAN (on TV):
It's quiet out there.

204
00:09:37,086 --> 00:09:39,187
MAN (on TV):
Maybe a little too quiet.

205
00:09:39,255 --> 00:09:40,521
Where are you going?

206
00:09:40,589 --> 00:09:42,356
Just gonna take a look
around outside.

207
00:09:42,424 --> 00:09:44,425
Bad idea.

208
00:09:46,762 --> 00:09:48,529
No, Jim,
don't open the door!

209
00:09:48,597 --> 00:09:50,932
Listen to her, Jim.

210
00:09:52,434 --> 00:09:53,701
(door opening)

211
00:09:53,768 --> 00:09:54,868
Don't worry.

212
00:09:54,936 --> 00:09:56,202
There's no one out there.
(door slamming)

213
00:09:56,270 --> 00:09:58,104
(woman screaming)

214
00:10:05,778 --> 00:10:07,479
(three knocks)
SHELDON:
Leonard and Penny!

215
00:10:07,546 --> 00:10:08,813
(three knocks)
Leonard and Penny!

216
00:10:08,881 --> 00:10:10,215
(three knocks)
Leonard
and Penny!

217
00:10:11,718 --> 00:10:14,119
LEONARD (singsongy):
Who is it?

218
00:10:18,414 --> 00:10:21,015
All right, we've got
a titanium dead bolt

219
00:10:21,083 --> 00:10:22,449
and a reinforced jamb

220
00:10:22,517 --> 00:10:25,186
controlled by a state-of-the-art
electronic access system.

221
00:10:25,254 --> 00:10:26,421
What if they cut the power?

222
00:10:26,488 --> 00:10:28,122
There's a 200-watt
uninterruptible

223
00:10:28,190 --> 00:10:29,424
backup power supply.

224
00:10:29,492 --> 00:10:31,193
What if someone steals my keys?
There are

225
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:33,962
independent voice
and fingerprint scanners.

226
00:10:34,030 --> 00:10:36,231
What if someone kidnaps me,
forces me to record my voice,

227
00:10:36,299 --> 00:10:38,667
and then cuts off my thumb?

228
00:10:38,735 --> 00:10:41,370
I'll send them a
basket of muffins.

229
00:10:43,106 --> 00:10:46,274
Now, inside, we've got
motion detectors,

230
00:10:46,342 --> 00:10:50,578
infrared sensors, and cameras
connected to a server

231
00:10:50,646 --> 00:10:53,548
running state-of-the-art
facial recognition software.

232
00:10:53,615 --> 00:10:55,449
Where did you get
all this stuff?

233
00:10:55,517 --> 00:10:58,285
Eh, I got a buddy over
at the Department of Defense.

234
00:10:58,353 --> 00:10:59,653
He just gave it to you?

235
00:10:59,721 --> 00:11:02,222
I'm sure he would have
if I had asked.

236
00:11:03,024 --> 00:11:03,957
Ironically, their security

237
00:11:04,025 --> 00:11:06,293
isn't all that good.

238
00:11:06,361 --> 00:11:08,728
Raj, your car is blocking me...
(alarm blaring)

239
00:11:08,796 --> 00:11:11,298
COMPUTER VOICE:
Intruder alert, intruder alert.
(screams)

240
00:11:11,366 --> 00:11:12,533
Intruder alert.
What the hell?

241
00:11:12,601 --> 00:11:14,035
Intruder alert.
Sorry, let me help you.

242
00:11:15,103 --> 00:11:16,637
Wonderful
security system

243
00:11:16,705 --> 00:11:19,607
if we're attacked
by a school of tuna.

244
00:11:19,675 --> 00:11:21,877
Don't worry, the net's
going to be electrified.

245
00:11:21,945 --> 00:11:25,848
You picture her on the floor,
spasming uncontrollably.

246
00:11:26,783 --> 00:11:29,619
Better.

247
00:11:30,988 --> 00:11:33,255
<i>SHELDON:
Sheldon's journal.</i>

248
00:11:33,323 --> 00:11:35,257
<i>Security system in place.</i>

249
00:11:35,325 --> 00:11:38,060
<i>However, sleep continues
to elude me.</i>

250
00:11:38,128 --> 00:11:42,231
<i>I've seen the underbelly

251
00:11:42,299 --> 00:11:47,203
<i>this so-called City of Roses,

252
00:11:47,271 --> 00:11:50,407
<i>Ah, the injustice.</i>

253
00:11:50,474 --> 00:11:53,143
<i>I lie here awake, tormented,</i>

254
00:11:53,211 --> 00:11:56,013
<i>while out there evil lurks,</i>

255
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:59,350
<i>probably playing Donkey Kong
on my classic Nintendo.</i>

256
00:12:01,887 --> 00:12:03,888

257
00:12:19,638 --> 00:12:21,872
(whimpers)

258
00:12:31,282 --> 00:12:33,551
Oh, dear.

259
00:12:33,619 --> 00:12:35,653
(gasps)

260
00:12:35,721 --> 00:12:39,190
I am the master
of my own bladder.

261
00:12:43,162 --> 00:12:45,164
(passing car horn honks)

262
00:12:54,374 --> 00:12:56,075
(three knocks)
Leonard and Penny.

263
00:12:56,143 --> 00:12:57,143
(three knocks)
Leonard
and Penny.

264
00:12:57,210 --> 00:12:58,177
(three knocks)
Leonard and Penny.

265
00:12:58,245 --> 00:12:59,178
Oh, my...

266
00:12:59,246 --> 00:13:02,816
God, Sheldon.

267
00:13:04,819 --> 00:13:08,221
What the hell are you
doing out there?

268
00:13:10,791 --> 00:13:12,792
I heard a noise.

269
00:13:13,894 --> 00:13:15,228
It was us.

270
00:13:15,296 --> 00:13:16,830
We knocked over a lamp.

271
00:13:16,898 --> 00:13:18,798
Why would you
knock over a lamp?

272
00:13:18,866 --> 00:13:20,767
We were going to have...
He doesn't need

273
00:13:20,835 --> 00:13:23,069
to know what we were doing,
Leonard.

274
00:13:24,104 --> 00:13:27,206
Oh.

275
00:13:27,274 --> 00:13:29,675
No, she's right, I don't need
to know what you were doing.

276
00:13:29,743 --> 00:13:31,743
Carry on.

277
00:13:31,811 --> 00:13:32,744
What are you doing?

278
00:13:32,812 --> 00:13:35,380
Use the door.

279
00:13:35,448 --> 00:13:36,815
Good thinking.

280
00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:39,817
Perhaps I'll check
the perimeter

281
00:13:39,885 --> 00:13:41,118
and make
some warm milk.

282
00:13:41,186 --> 00:13:43,688
Great, you do that.

283
00:13:43,755 --> 00:13:46,891
Would you like me to bring you
some warm milk?

284
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:48,726
I'm lactose intolerant.

285
00:13:48,794 --> 00:13:51,196
And you don't wish to alarm me
with any more loud noises.

286
00:13:51,263 --> 00:13:52,497
Very thoughtful.

287
00:13:53,799 --> 00:13:55,200
Warm milk, Penny?

288
00:13:55,267 --> 00:13:56,667
No, thanks.

289
00:13:56,735 --> 00:13:58,369
Fine.

290
00:13:58,437 --> 00:13:59,671
Good night to you, sir.

291
00:14:00,205 --> 00:14:01,973
Miss.

292
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:04,042
(door closes, Leonard groans)

293
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:05,176
Sorry about that.

294
00:14:05,244 --> 00:14:07,044
Ugh, what can you do?

295
00:14:07,112 --> 00:14:08,779
Here.

296
00:14:08,847 --> 00:14:11,648
Intruder alert, intruder alert.
(alarm blaring)

297
00:14:11,716 --> 00:14:13,716
Intruder alert, intruder alert.
(electricity arcing,
Sheldon screaming)

298
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:19,655
(alarm blaring)

299
00:14:19,723 --> 00:14:23,725
(electricity buzzing)

300
00:14:25,161 --> 00:14:27,662
Looks like Wolowitz got
the net electrified.

301
00:14:27,730 --> 00:14:30,298
Sheldon, are
you okay?

302
00:14:30,365 --> 00:14:31,733
I-I'm fine...

303
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:36,270
although I'm no longer
the master of my own bladder.

304
00:14:39,675 --> 00:14:41,442
My new computer came

305
00:14:41,510 --> 00:14:44,746
with Windows 7.

306
00:14:44,813 --> 00:14:48,282
Windows 7 is much more user-
friendly than Windows Vista.

307
00:14:49,418 --> 00:14:51,419
I don't like that.

308
00:14:54,422 --> 00:14:56,691
Don't you think looking
for a new city to live in

309
00:14:56,758 --> 00:14:59,126
is a bit of an overreaction?

310
00:14:59,194 --> 00:15:00,995
Our apartment
was broken into,

311
00:15:01,062 --> 00:15:02,863
our security system
tried to kill me,

312
00:15:02,931 --> 00:15:05,832
and as a result,
I'm leaving Pasadena forever.

313
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:08,402
Tell me how that's overreacting.

314
00:15:08,469 --> 00:15:10,437
Come on, Sheldon,
you can't move.

315
00:15:10,505 --> 00:15:12,072
Don't you need
to stay in one place

316
00:15:12,139 --> 00:15:13,507
so the mother ship can find you

317
00:15:13,574 --> 00:15:16,409
when it returns?
(laughing)

318
00:15:16,477 --> 00:15:19,245
Oh, if that were only true.

319
00:15:19,313 --> 00:15:22,382
Unfortunately, as I'm earthbound
for the foreseeable future,

320
00:15:22,449 --> 00:15:24,917
I need to find a location
that's more hospitable

321
00:15:24,985 --> 00:15:28,320
than the mean streets
of Pasadena, like...

322
00:15:28,388 --> 00:15:30,055
Enid, Oklahoma.

323
00:15:30,123 --> 00:15:31,590
Low crime rate

324
00:15:31,658 --> 00:15:34,793
and high-speed
Internet connectivity...

325
00:15:34,861 --> 00:15:37,395
but no model train shops.

326
00:15:39,098 --> 00:15:41,899
Sorry, Enid.

327
00:15:43,902 --> 00:15:46,169
Is he quitting his job
at the university?

328
00:15:46,237 --> 00:15:48,405
Oh, no, he's going
to telecommute.

329
00:15:48,473 --> 00:15:51,008
Everybody's really
excited about it.

330
00:15:51,076 --> 00:15:52,242
All right.

331
00:15:52,310 --> 00:15:55,278
Boone, North Carolina.

332
00:15:55,346 --> 00:15:57,580
"Every summer since 1952,

333
00:15:57,648 --> 00:16:00,683
"Boone has hosted an outdoor
amphitheater portrayal

334
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:04,920
of the life and times
of its namesake, Dan'l Boone."

335
00:16:06,189 --> 00:16:08,691
Sounds like something that would
attract the wrong crowd.

336
00:16:11,862 --> 00:16:13,596
Penny, you're from Nebraska,
correct?

337
00:16:13,664 --> 00:16:14,798
Born and raised.

338
00:16:20,905 --> 00:16:23,741
It will take me a few
days to get settled.

339
00:16:23,809 --> 00:16:27,044
After I do, I will e-mail
you detailed PDFs

340
00:16:27,112 --> 00:16:29,013
containing diagrams
and instructions

341
00:16:29,081 --> 00:16:30,815
that will guide you through
packing and shipping

342
00:16:30,883 --> 00:16:33,350
the rest of my possessions
to Bozeman, Montana.

343
00:16:34,519 --> 00:16:36,353
In the meantime,
please forward my mail.

344
00:16:37,388 --> 00:16:38,555
Any place specific

345
00:16:38,622 --> 00:16:41,124
or just the Bozeman,
Montana Loony Bin?

346
00:16:42,593 --> 00:16:44,527
I sense you're making a joke,

347
00:16:44,594 --> 00:16:47,529
but Bozeman does have a comedy
club called The Loony Bin,

348
00:16:47,597 --> 00:16:49,798
so do not forward
my mail there.

349
00:16:49,866 --> 00:16:51,565
Oh, come on.

350
00:16:51,633 --> 00:16:53,467
So you were the victim
of a crime.

351
00:16:53,535 --> 00:16:55,168
That's part of life.

352
00:16:55,236 --> 00:16:57,404
When my great-grandfather
first came to this country,

353
00:16:57,472 --> 00:17:00,239
he put all his
hopes and dreams

354
00:17:00,307 --> 00:17:01,841
into this little
butcher shop he ran

355
00:17:01,908 --> 00:17:03,475
on the Lower East Side
of New York.

356
00:17:03,543 --> 00:17:04,843
You know what happened?

357
00:17:04,911 --> 00:17:07,779
Every customer who walked
into that butcher shop

358
00:17:07,847 --> 00:17:09,248
and asked
for a pound of liver,

359
00:17:09,315 --> 00:17:11,216
(fingers snap)
got ripped off.

360
00:17:12,919 --> 00:17:14,153
But...

361
00:17:14,221 --> 00:17:17,822
those people moved on,
and so should you.

362
00:17:17,890 --> 00:17:19,524
<i>I am moving on.</i>

363
00:17:19,592 --> 00:17:21,659
I'm going to be a Bozite.

364
00:17:21,727 --> 00:17:23,695
They call themselves "Bozites"?

365
00:17:23,763 --> 00:17:25,096
They should. It's one
of the first things

366
00:17:25,164 --> 00:17:26,531
I plan to bring up
upon arrival.

367
00:17:28,501 --> 00:17:30,669
Sheldon, I can't
believe I'm saying this,

368
00:17:30,737 --> 00:17:32,571
but I'm going to miss you.
Please,

369
00:17:32,639 --> 00:17:34,874
Penny, as you know,
I'm not comfortable

370
00:17:34,941 --> 00:17:38,244
with prolonged good-byes
and maudlin displays of emotion,

371
00:17:38,312 --> 00:17:40,313
so I prepared
a short video.

372
00:17:43,251 --> 00:17:44,852
SHELDON (on laptop):
Greetings.

373
00:17:44,919 --> 00:17:48,656
As you know, I'm not comfortable
with prolonged good-byes

374
00:17:48,723 --> 00:17:50,857
and maudlin
displays of emotion,

375
00:17:50,925 --> 00:17:52,693
so I prepared
this short video.

376
00:17:52,761 --> 00:17:56,330
The four of you are three
of my closest friends

377
00:17:56,398 --> 00:17:58,399
and one treasured acquaintance.

378
00:18:02,937 --> 00:18:05,039
Though I cannot state
categorically that my life

379
00:18:05,106 --> 00:18:07,941
will be diminished
by not having you in it,

380
00:18:08,009 --> 00:18:10,177
I am comfortable
if you choose to believe that.

381
00:18:12,347 --> 00:18:13,747
Since you intend to remain

382
00:18:13,815 --> 00:18:16,583
in this lawless
metropolitan area,

383
00:18:16,651 --> 00:18:19,253
statistics suggest that
you will succumb to tragic

384
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:21,722
and gruesome ends
before we meet again.

385
00:18:21,790 --> 00:18:24,458
Live long and prosper.

386
00:18:26,494 --> 00:18:27,928
Sheldon, that's so...

387
00:18:30,498 --> 00:18:32,999
You might want to lock
the door behind me.

388
00:18:34,268 --> 00:18:35,835
This isn't Bozeman.

389
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:41,541
How the hell do I know
who's the friend

390
00:18:41,609 --> 00:18:43,277
and who's the acquaintance?

391
00:18:46,782 --> 00:18:48,716
(wind whistling outside)

392
00:18:48,783 --> 00:18:50,918
That is a bracing cold,

393
00:18:50,986 --> 00:18:52,453
an invigorating cold.

394
00:18:52,521 --> 00:18:54,622
Lord, is it cold!

395
00:18:56,558 --> 00:18:58,760
Help you with
your bags, sir?

396
00:18:58,828 --> 00:19:01,496
Thank you, fellow Bozite.

397
00:19:01,564 --> 00:19:04,566
And may I say, you are
the living embodiment of all

398
00:19:04,634 --> 00:19:08,203
the promises made by our lovely
town's Chamber of Commerce.

399
00:19:12,175 --> 00:19:14,176
Wait!

400
00:19:15,311 --> 00:19:17,512
Wait!

401
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:19,581
Excuse me!

402
00:19:23,552 --> 00:19:25,352
(wind howling)

403
00:19:29,224 --> 00:19:31,859
One ticket to Pasadena,
California, please.

404
00:19:38,191 --> 00:19:39,492
(door unlocking, opening).

405
00:19:40,345 --> 00:19:42,212
Hey, look who's back!

406
00:19:42,980 --> 00:19:44,381
Interesting.

407
00:19:44,449 --> 00:19:46,417
The acquaintance
is the first to greet me.
