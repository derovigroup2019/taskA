1
00:00:04,324 --> 00:00:06,844
This movie baffles me
every time we watch it.

2
00:00:07,381 --> 00:00:08,356
What do you mean?

3
00:00:08,408 --> 00:00:10,010
The instructions are very clear:

4
00:00:10,124 --> 00:00:11,867
"don't feed the gremlins
after midnight."

5
00:00:13,594 --> 00:00:15,419
"don't get the gremlins wet."

6
00:00:18,195 --> 00:00:19,441
How hard is that?

7
00:00:20,267 --> 00:00:21,820
(door opening)

8
00:00:22,054 --> 00:00:23,114
Hi, guys.

9
00:00:23,236 --> 00:00:24,186
Hi, honey.

10
00:00:24,278 --> 00:00:25,081
Hey.

11
00:00:25,157 --> 00:00:26,422
Ooh, we're "hoy" now, are we?

12
00:00:26,516 --> 00:00:29,133
Yes. Since their relationship
became carnal,

13
00:00:29,185 --> 00:00:31,656
Penny has upgraded his
designated term of endearment,

14
00:00:31,752 --> 00:00:34,471
Thus distinguishing him
from those she calls "sweetie,"

15
00:00:34,523 --> 00:00:37,230
Usually in an attempt to soften
a thinly-veiled insult.

16
00:00:38,735 --> 00:00:40,597
You're boring people
sweetie.

17
00:00:42,347 --> 00:00:44,754
Although, sometimes,
she omits the veil entirely.

18
00:00:45,875 --> 00:00:47,522
So, what are
you guys doing?

19
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:49,227
Celebrating
columbus day.

20
00:00:49,298 --> 00:00:51,592
<i>We're watching goonies, gremlins
and young sherlock holmes.</i>

21
00:00:52,533 --> 00:00:54,796
They're all written
by chris cumbus.

22
00:00:56,653 --> 00:00:57,710
Okay.

23
00:00:57,769 --> 00:00:59,638
What do you watch
on thanksgiving?

24
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:01,059
The parade.

25
00:01:02,925 --> 00:01:04,262
Oh, you know,
that reminds me--

26
00:01:04,321 --> 00:01:05,989
I usually go back to
nebraska for thanksgiving,

27
00:01:06,062 --> 00:01:07,301
But this year they're
calling it off

28
00:01:07,343 --> 00:01:08,972
On account of my
brother's trial.

29
00:01:09,072 --> 00:01:11,087
What's he on trial for?

30
00:01:11,167 --> 00:01:12,968
Oh, just a big
misunderstanding.

31
00:01:13,037 --> 00:01:14,597
You know, you'd actually
li my brother.

32
00:01:14,642 --> 00:01:16,014
He's kind of
a chemist.

33
00:01:19,579 --> 00:01:21,047
Anyway, I was thinking
I'd have thanksgiving he,

34
00:01:21,107 --> 00:01:22,506
And you are all invited.

35
00:01:22,595 --> 00:01:23,870
Oh. I'll be there.

36
00:01:23,938 --> 00:01:25,654
Will you be serving
cranberry jelly

37
00:01:25,706 --> 00:01:27,217
Or cranberry sauce?

38
00:01:28,072 --> 00:01:29,693
I guess I could
serve both.

39
00:01:29,787 --> 00:01:32,564
You guess? I don't seem to
have much of a handle on this.

40
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:37,301
Yeah, I really wish I could,
penny, but every year,

41
00:01:37,337 --> 00:01:39,846
Mother has all the
relatives over and cooks up

42
00:01:39,885 --> 00:01:41,558
Her famous tur-briska-fil.

43
00:01:43,109 --> 00:01:44,498
Tur-briska-fil?

44
00:01:44,574 --> 00:01:47,306
Turkey stuffed with a brisket
stuffed with gefilte fish.

45
00:01:49,993 --> 00:01:51,555
It's not as good as it sounds.

46
00:01:53,462 --> 00:01:54,576
Raj, what about you?

47
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:56,753
Oh, he usually comes
to my house. Right, pal?

48
00:02:01,661 --> 00:02:02,916
All right, this year,
you don't have to

49
00:02:02,977 --> 00:02:04,713
Eat the
tur-briska-fil.

50
00:02:05,802 --> 00:02:06,621
(chuckles)

51
00:02:06,709 --> 00:02:07,780
I don't even chew it.

52
00:02:07,858 --> 00:02:09,141
I swallow it like pills.

53
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:17,074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

54
00:02:36,332 --> 00:02:37,553
So, what's going on
with raj?

55
00:02:38,069 --> 00:02:39,515
Well, the good news is,

56
00:02:39,635 --> 00:02:41,978
He has no problem
with my mother's tur-brka-fil.

57
00:02:43,458 --> 00:02:44,734
Hard to believe,
but go on.

58
00:02:46,099 --> 00:02:48,746
The bad news is,
he says he'getting deported.

59
00:02:49,038 --> 00:02:49,884
Leonard:
What do you mean,

60
00:02:49,955 --> 00:02:50,914
He's getting deported?

61
00:02:50,985 --> 00:02:52,246
I believe it means
that the u.S. Government

62
00:02:52,281 --> 00:02:53,928
Is going to expel him
from the country.

63
00:02:54,979 --> 00:02:56,421
He could then either return
to his native india,

64
00:02:56,493 --> 00:02:58,833
Emigrate to another country
that's willing to accept him

65
00:02:58,929 --> 00:03:01,485
Or wander the high seas
as a stateless pirate.

66
00:03:05,442 --> 00:03:06,655
Personally, I'd choose pirate.

67
00:03:08,897 --> 00:03:10,035
Penny, would you mind
stepping outside

68
00:03:10,092 --> 00:03:11,354
So we can speak to him?

69
00:03:11,425 --> 00:03:13,172
(groans)
fine.

70
00:03:13,218 --> 00:03:15,904
But the man really needs to work
on his girl issues.

71
00:03:16,005 --> 00:03:18,228
Another reason to consider
life of piracy.

72
00:03:18,404 --> 00:03:20,658
Even today, I understand
that's an all-male profession.

73
00:03:24,067 --> 00:03:24,898
Okay, she's go.

74
00:03:29,782 --> 00:03:31,975
Sorry.
I lost my cool.

75
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:35,285
So, what's going on?

76
00:03:35,358 --> 00:03:36,975
Okay, here's the deal:

77
00:03:37,082 --> 00:03:39,080
Six months ago, my
research testing

78
00:03:39,155 --> 00:03:41,684
The predicted composition
of trans-neptunian objects

79
00:03:41,724 --> 00:03:43,329
Ran into a dead end.

80
00:03:43,382 --> 00:03:45,400
So?
So, my visa's only good

81
00:03:45,469 --> 00:03:48,625
Aand when they find out
at I've got squat,

82
00:03:48,671 --> 00:03:49,829
They're going to cut me off.

83
00:03:50,622 --> 00:03:52,973
By the way, when I say squat,
I mean diddly-squat.

84
00:03:54,567 --> 00:03:56,441
I wish I had squat.

85
00:03:58,050 --> 00:04:00,582
So, wait, what have you been
doing for the past six months?

86
00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:02,525
You know, checking e-mail,

87
00:04:03,624 --> 00:04:04,908
Updating my facebook status,

88
00:04:05,726 --> 00:04:07,514
Messing up wikipedia entries.

89
00:04:09,845 --> 00:04:11,125
Hey, did you know netflix

90
00:04:11,186 --> 00:04:12,664
Lets you stream movies
on your computer now?

91
00:04:13,906 --> 00:04:15,881
And you've continued
to take the universit's money

92
00:04:15,972 --> 00:04:17,490
Under false pretenses?

93
00:04:17,568 --> 00:04:19,657
Highly unethical
for an astrophysicist.

94
00:04:20,532 --> 00:04:22,054
Although pctically mandatory
for a pirate.

95
00:04:24,726 --> 00:04:25,962
I don't want to go back
to india.

96
00:04:26,055 --> 00:04:29,596
It's hot and loud,
and there's so many people.

97
00:04:31,498 --> 00:04:33,526
You have no idea--
they're everywhere.

98
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:36,862
Okay, guys, think.

99
00:04:36,946 --> 00:04:38,440
How do we keep raj
in the country?

100
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:45,660
Penny: Why doesn't
he just get another job?

101
00:04:51,930 --> 00:04:53,164
What are you
asking me for?

102
00:04:53,216 --> 00:04:55,349
I don't know if you
can talk now or not.

103
00:05:01,162 --> 00:05:01,957
Oh, beef...

104
00:05:02,093 --> 00:05:03,854
I'm going to miss
you so much.

105
00:05:05,913 --> 00:05:07,096
Do you know,
at the mumbai mcdonald's,

106
00:05:07,183 --> 00:05:08,578
You can't get a big mac?

107
00:05:08,682 --> 00:05:10,847
All you can get
is a chicken maharaja mac.

108
00:05:11,836 --> 00:05:13,053
And the special sauce--

109
00:05:13,170 --> 00:05:15,248
Curry-- which, in india,
believe you me,

110
00:05:15,312 --> 00:05:16,604
Is really not that special.

111
00:05:18,356 --> 00:05:20,295
Don't worry,
you'll find another job.

112
00:05:20,369 --> 00:05:22,140
Yeah let me start
practicing for it.

113
00:05:22,098 --> 00:05:24,021
"do you want fries with
that maharaja mac?"

114
00:05:25,844 --> 00:05:27,055
Sheldon:
Hi, leonard.

115
00:05:27,130 --> 00:05:28,157
Hello, raj.

116
00:05:28,266 --> 00:05:29,619
Hello sheldon.

117
00:05:30,505 --> 00:05:33,561
Forgive me, as you know, I'm no
adept at reading facial cues,

118
00:05:33,622 --> 00:05:35,039
But I'm going
to take a stab here:

119
00:05:35,152 --> 00:05:37,619
You're either sad or nauseated.

120
00:05:38,698 --> 00:05:40,043
I'm sad.

121
00:05:40,102 --> 00:05:41,158
I was going to say sad.

122
00:05:41,226 --> 00:05:42,534
I don't know why I hedged.

123
00:05:44,677 --> 00:05:45,513
What are you eating?

124
00:05:45,583 --> 00:05:48,611
Elbow macaroni with ground
hamburger and tomato sauce.

125
00:05:48,724 --> 00:05:50,562
Oh, beefaroni.

126
00:05:50,869 --> 00:05:52,865
I think I'll miss you
most of all.

127
00:05:54,292 --> 00:05:55,843
I've always been
a little confused about this.

128
00:05:55,919 --> 00:05:57,529
Why don't hindus eat beef?

129
00:05:57,580 --> 00:05:58,971
We believe cows are gods.

130
00:05:58,956 --> 00:05:59,938
Not technically.

131
00:06:00,057 --> 00:06:02,376
<i>In hinduism, cattle are
thought to be like god.</i>

132
00:06:02,566 --> 00:06:04,713
Do not tell me about
my own culture, sheldon!

133
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:06,955
In the mood I'm in, I'll take
you out-- I swear to cow!

134
00:06:09,866 --> 00:06:11,128
I'm sorry.

135
00:06:11,254 --> 00:06:12,539
Me, too.

136
00:06:12,636 --> 00:06:13,995
I'm st...
I'm a little on edge.

137
00:06:13,970 --> 00:06:14,780
Understandable.

138
00:06:15,294 --> 00:06:17,053
Your entire life seems
to be crumbling around you,

139
00:06:17,150 --> 00:06:18,707
And your future
appears bleak at bt.

140
00:06:18,769 --> 00:06:21,401
Thank you.

141
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:23,076
And you're wrong
about hinduism and cows.

142
00:06:24,654 --> 00:06:26,339
Hey, raj, guess what.

143
00:06:26,423 --> 00:06:27,860
Professor laughlin
is looking for someone to join

144
00:06:27,928 --> 00:06:29,556
The stellar evolution
research team.

145
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:34,073
You-you're kidding!
That's fantastic!
What are you waiting for? Call
him and set up an interview.

146
00:06:34,130 --> 00:06:34,999
I'm on it.

147
00:06:35,485 --> 00:06:36,608
That's happy, right?

148
00:06:36,704 --> 00:06:37,660
Yeah.
Nailed it.

149
00:06:40,292 --> 00:06:41,961
Dr. Koothrappali, come on in.

150
00:06:42,029 --> 00:06:43,762
I was surprised to here
you were interested

151
00:06:43,832 --> 00:06:45,192
In joining our little team.

152
00:06:45,517 --> 00:06:47,809
Giving up on those
trans-neptunian objects, are we?

153
00:06:47,898 --> 00:06:49,773
No, no; it's a very
promising area.

154
00:06:49,850 --> 00:06:52,359
I'd spend several
more years on it.Ld,

155
00:06:52,446 --> 00:06:54,040
But I just couldn'pass up
the opportunity

156
00:06:54,135 --> 00:06:56,271
To work wi you
on your tremendously exciting

157
00:06:56,346 --> 00:06:58,904
And not yet conclusively
disproved hypothesis.

158
00:06:59,834 --> 00:07:00,670
Splendid.

159
00:07:00,739 --> 00:07:02,086
Uh, please sit down.

160
00:07:02,173 --> 00:07:03,744
Can I offer you
a sherry?

161
00:07:03,811 --> 00:07:05,409
It's a little
early, isn't it?

162
00:07:05,465 --> 00:07:07,249
Not on proxima centauri.

163
00:07:07,297 --> 00:07:08,364
(chuckles)

164
00:07:08,412 --> 00:07:09,567
(laughing):
That's very good.

165
00:07:09,673 --> 00:07:11,781
Jolly amusing,
but if you don't mind,

166
00:07:11,874 --> 00:07:14,062
I'll hold off
until sunset on titan.

167
00:07:15,259 --> 00:07:15,992
(laughs)
well done.

168
00:07:16,038 --> 00:07:17,304
I have a fling you're going

169
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:18,955
To fit in just fine,
dr. Koothrappali.

170
00:07:19,049 --> 00:07:20,107
Thank you, sir.

171
00:07:20,186 --> 00:07:21,302
(knock at door)

172
00:07:22,099 --> 00:07:22,841
I'm sorry.

173
00:07:22,931 --> 00:07:24,041
Am I late?

174
00:07:24,096 --> 00:07:25,180
No, no, no.
Right on time.

175
00:07:25,258 --> 00:07:26,897
Dr. Koothrappali,
may I present

176
00:07:26,941 --> 00:07:28,787
Dr. Millstone from MIT.

177
00:07:28,864 --> 00:07:31,025
She'll be heading up
our data analysis team.

178
00:07:31,128 --> 00:07:33,154
It's nice to meet you,
dr. Koothrappali.

179
00:07:34,545 --> 00:07:37,495
I read your paper on kuiper belt
object size distribution.

180
00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:39,464
I really enjoy it.

181
00:07:43,628 --> 00:07:45,944
How did you correct
for the selection bias?

182
00:07:46,055 --> 00:07:49,638
Well, I ran a simulation
that allowed me

183
00:07:49,702 --> 00:07:51,868
To correct for the
observational efficiency.

184
00:07:51,942 --> 00:07:53,910
That's just fascinating.

185
00:07:54,235 --> 00:07:55,085
Thank you.

186
00:07:56,913 --> 00:07:59,814
Would you like to hear
more about it in my hot tub?

187
00:08:04,408 --> 00:08:05,638
So, when do I start?

188
00:08:09,890 --> 00:08:11,342
What do you mean you
didn't get the job?

189
00:08:11,412 --> 00:08:12,492
How could you
not get it?

190
00:08:13,367 --> 00:08:16,629
U know... He's british;
I'm indian.

191
00:08:17,459 --> 00:08:19,845
Ever since gandhi,
they haven't liked us very much.

192
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:23,617
Wait, are you saying that
he discriminated against you?

193
00:08:23,692 --> 00:08:25,068
Because we should
file a complaint.

194
00:08:25,177 --> 00:08:26,137
That's okay.

195
00:08:26,232 --> 00:08:27,726
A complaint ha's been filed.

196
00:08:30,221 --> 00:08:30,912
So, that's it.

197
00:08:31,036 --> 00:08:32,597
That was my last hope.

198
00:08:32,677 --> 00:08:34,111
I'm going
to be deported,

199
00:08:34,778 --> 00:08:35,813
Sent home in disgrace,

200
00:08:35,877 --> 00:08:39,053
Exposed to the sardonic barb
of my cousin sanjay.

201
00:08:39,112 --> 00:08:41,614
Or, as you may know him,
dave from at&t customer service.

202
00:08:48,949 --> 00:08:49,892
I'm really going
to miss you.

203
00:08:49,964 --> 00:08:51,724
Will you come visit me
in India?

204
00:08:53,086 --> 00:08:54,948
Gee, that's, like,
a 17-hour flight.

205
00:08:55,953 --> 00:08:57,445
How about I meet
you halfway?

206
00:08:57,559 --> 00:08:59,701
Halfway is 600 miles
off the coast of japan.

207
00:09:00,456 --> 00:09:02,252
Tell you what,
we'll skype.

208
00:09:06,306 --> 00:09:07,206
Gentlemen.

209
00:09:07,274 --> 00:09:08,469
Leonard:
Hey.
Raj,

210
00:09:08,535 --> 00:09:10,431
Did you get the job
with professor laughlin?

211
00:09:10,497 --> 00:09:12,358
No.
I assumed as much.

212
00:09:12,452 --> 00:09:13,440
But never fear.

213
00:09:13,548 --> 00:09:15,070
Like the subordinate
male protagonist

214
00:09:15,148 --> 00:09:16,537
In countless action movies

215
00:09:16,591 --> 00:09:18,719
Who disappears half way
through the second reel,

216
00:09:18,787 --> 00:09:20,702
I have returned to save the day.

217
00:09:24,348 --> 00:09:25,421
Odd.

218
00:09:25,481 --> 00:09:26,919
Usually, he's met by cheers.

219
00:09:27,876 --> 00:09:28,665
Anyway,

220
00:09:28,712 --> 00:09:29,859
I was thinking about exploring

221
00:09:29,954 --> 00:09:31,283
The string theory implications

222
00:09:31,353 --> 00:09:33,854
Of gamma rays from
dark matter annihilations,

223
00:09:33,923 --> 00:09:35,352
And it occurred to me
that I could benefit--

224
00:09:35,416 --> 00:09:36,278
Excuse me, sheldon.

225
00:09:36,351 --> 00:09:38,038
How many reels before
the subordine male protagonist

226
00:09:38,093 --> 00:09:39,584
Gets to his point?

227
00:09:39,658 --> 00:09:41,536
I'm sorry-- if you didn't
cheer at my entrance,

228
00:09:41,626 --> 00:09:42,972
It's too late
to buy into the premise.

229
00:09:46,202 --> 00:09:48,002
Anyway, I got
some extra money

230
00:09:48,097 --> 00:09:49,436
From the head of
the department,

231
00:09:49,512 --> 00:09:51,756
And raj can come
work for me.

232
00:09:53,106 --> 00:09:54,185
<i>You want me
to work with you?</i>

233
00:09:55,077 --> 00:09:56,296
<i>For me.</i>

234
00:09:57,153 --> 00:09:58,327
You're going to
have to listen

235
00:09:58,408 --> 00:09:59,883
More careful when
you're on the job.

236
00:10:01,101 --> 00:10:03,359
Ay, uh, please don't take this
the wrong way,

237
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:06,436
But I'd rather swim buck-naked
across the ganges

238
00:10:06,555 --> 00:10:08,036
With a paper cut on my nipple

239
00:10:08,788 --> 00:10:10,750
And die a slow,
agonizing death

240
00:10:10,812 --> 00:10:13,199
From a viral infection
than work with you.

241
00:10:15,201 --> 00:10:16,395
<i>For me.</i>

242
00:10:24,384 --> 00:10:25,230
(knock at door)

243
00:10:26,794 --> 00:10:27,858
Sheldon, are you busy?

244
00:10:27,937 --> 00:10:29,912
Of course I'm busy.

245
00:10:30,899 --> 00:10:32,188
Shall I wait?

246
00:10:46,457 --> 00:10:47,670
How may I help you?

247
00:10:49,446 --> 00:10:52,105
I've reconsider your offer
to let me work with you.

248
00:10:52,202 --> 00:10:53,832
<i>For me</i>

249
00:10:54,993 --> 00:10:56,427
<i>Yes, for you.</i>

250
00:10:56,526 --> 00:10:58,706
I do, however, have
a few conditions.

251
00:10:58,785 --> 00:11:00,294
First, at all times,

252
00:11:00,398 --> 00:11:02,421
I am to be treated
as a colleague and an equal.

253
00:11:02,503 --> 00:11:04,368
Second, my contributions
shall be noted

254
00:11:04,436 --> 00:11:05,575
In all published material.

255
00:11:05,631 --> 00:11:07,751
And third, you are never allowed
to lecture me

256
00:11:07,822 --> 00:11:09,682
On hinduism
or my indian culture.

257
00:11:11,563 --> 00:11:12,925
I'm impressed, raj.

258
00:11:13,315 --> 00:11:15,368
Those are very cogent
and reasonable conditions.

259
00:11:15,712 --> 00:11:16,609
Thank you.

260
00:11:19,219 --> 00:11:20,582
Then you leave me no choice.

261
00:11:20,694 --> 00:11:22,222
I accept the job.

262
00:11:24,047 --> 00:11:26,463
I'm sorry, I believe
you've misunderstood.

263
00:11:26,530 --> 00:11:28,236
I'm not giving you the job.

264
00:11:28,321 --> 00:11:31,433
I'm simply affording you
the opportunity to apply for it.

265
00:11:33,903 --> 00:11:35,627
Have a seat; we'll get started
with the interview.

266
00:11:35,729 --> 00:11:37,906
Wha... You're kidding!

267
00:11:38,717 --> 00:11:39,581
Please.

268
00:11:41,527 --> 00:11:42,468
(sighs)
all right.

269
00:11:42,597 --> 00:11:44,840
(annoyed sigh)

270
00:11:44,931 --> 00:11:46,589
So... (sighs)

271
00:11:49,054 --> 00:11:51,554
That's what you wear
to an interview?

272
00:11:53,217 --> 00:11:55,150
Come on, dude,
we've been friends for years.

273
00:11:55,222 --> 00:11:57,367
Oh, pulling strings, are we?

274
00:11:58,913 --> 00:12:01,648
Sheldon, for god's sakes,
don't make me beg.

275
00:12:02,305 --> 00:12:03,785
Bazinga!

276
00:12:04,821 --> 00:12:06,122
You've fallen victim

277
00:12:06,197 --> 00:12:08,454
To another one
of my classic practical jokes.

278
00:12:10,841 --> 00:12:13,322
I'm your boss now.
You may want to laugh at that.

279
00:12:17,661 --> 00:12:20,556
Ah, nice having the
place to ourselves, isn't it?

280
00:12:20,892 --> 00:12:21,683
Uh-huh.

281
00:12:22,016 --> 00:12:23,351
Now that raj is
working for sheldon,

282
00:12:23,444 --> 00:12:25,072
I don't have to chauffeur
him around anymore.

283
00:12:25,195 --> 00:12:27,182
Plus, yeah, with them
working late so much,

284
00:12:27,242 --> 00:12:28,641
We get some privacy.

285
00:12:28,717 --> 00:12:29,769
Mm-hmm.

286
00:12:31,457 --> 00:12:34,439
Hey, want to get a little crazy?

287
00:12:35,224 --> 00:12:36,392
What are you thinking?

288
00:12:36,470 --> 00:12:39,185
Let's slide over to
sheldon's spot a make out.

289
00:12:42,481 --> 00:12:44,309
You are a dirty girl.

290
00:12:46,828 --> 00:12:47,851
(knocking on door)

291
00:12:47,929 --> 00:12:49,326
Oh, god, how did he know?

292
00:12:50,321 --> 00:12:51,510
Hello.

293
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:53,731
Hi, howard.
(wry laugh)

294
00:12:53,819 --> 00:12:55,127
Am I interrupting?

295
00:12:55,238 --> 00:12:56,719
Little bit, yeah.

296
00:12:56,875 --> 00:12:58,393
Guess I should have called.

297
00:12:58,522 --> 00:12:59,758
Yeah, maybe.

298
00:12:59,870 --> 00:13:01,078
(sighs)

299
00:13:01,207 --> 00:13:03,076
(clicking tongue)

300
00:13:07,989 --> 00:13:10,300
Tonight's the night
I usually go line dancing

301
00:13:10,412 --> 00:13:12,023
With raj at the palomino.

302
00:13:13,269 --> 00:13:14,699
Uh-huh.

303
00:13:15,462 --> 00:13:16,911
But he's working with sheldon.

304
00:13:17,002 --> 00:13:18,203
Yes, we know.

305
00:13:19,154 --> 00:13:20,487
Want me to leave?

306
00:13:21,450 --> 00:13:22,703
You know, whatever.

307
00:13:23,646 --> 00:13:25,442
Okay, I guess I can hang
for a little while.

308
00:13:27,526 --> 00:13:29,381
So what are we watching?

309
00:13:30,154 --> 00:13:31,923
<i>Sex and the city.
Yikes.</i>

310
00:13:32,055 --> 00:13:34,914
Hey, I happen
to love this movie.

311
00:13:34,881 --> 00:13:36,327
Fine, let's watch it.

312
00:13:36,809 --> 00:13:39,644
Maybe all our periods
will synchronize.

313
00:13:44,272 --> 00:13:46,386
All right, we're going to
be designing an experiment

314
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:48,251
To look
for the nihilation spectrum

315
00:13:48,354 --> 00:13:50,484
Resulting from dark matter
collisions in space.

316
00:13:51,214 --> 00:13:52,771
Ooh, dark matter.

317
00:13:52,855 --> 00:13:54,392
We better bring
a flashlight.

318
00:13:54,469 --> 00:13:56,015
(chuckles)

319
00:13:57,727 --> 00:13:58,969
I was making a joke.

320
00:13:59,015 --> 00:14:00,160
I'm the boss.

321
00:14:00,219 --> 00:14:01,508
I make the jokes.

322
00:14:03,645 --> 00:14:05,323
Sorry
go ahead and make your joke.

323
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:06,939
This is not the
time for joking.

324
00:14:08,443 --> 00:14:09,765
We're doing
serious research,

325
00:14:09,864 --> 00:14:11,629
Which requires complete
and utter focus.

326
00:14:11,742 --> 00:14:13,951
All right,
let's buckle down and work.

327
00:14:14,587 --> 00:14:16,475
("eye of the tiger"
by survivor playing)

328
00:14:44,698 --> 00:14:46,019
Sheldon.
What?

329
00:14:46,077 --> 00:14:47,142
I need an aspirin.

330
00:14:47,229 --> 00:14:48,259
Top desk drawer.

331
00:14:55,713 --> 00:14:56,824
Thank you.
Alright?

332
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:57,941
Yes.
Good.

333
00:14:57,966 --> 00:15:00,360
("eye of the tiger" resumes)

334
00:15:06,763 --> 00:15:07,974
That was fun.

335
00:15:08,661 --> 00:15:09,648
Thank you.

336
00:15:09,745 --> 00:15:11,562
Leonard, honey, you don't
have to say thank you

337
00:15:11,630 --> 00:15:12,954
Every time we have sex.

338
00:15:13,033 --> 00:15:14,478
Oh. Okay.

339
00:15:15,315 --> 00:15:17,491
Tomorrow you're going to
get a card in the mail.

340
00:15:17,542 --> 00:15:18,810
Just throw it away.

341
00:15:18,908 --> 00:15:20,721
(clattering)

342
00:15:22,259 --> 00:15:24,249
(in irish brogue):
Top o' the mornin'o ya!

343
00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:28,731
What are you doing here?

344
00:15:28,836 --> 00:15:31,271
Well, usually, on Sundays,
I go with raj

345
00:15:31,349 --> 00:15:33,666
To scam on hippie chicks
at the farmers market,

346
00:15:33,770 --> 00:15:36,646
But he's still working
with sheldon,

347
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:37,926
So I thought I'd come over here

348
00:15:38,037 --> 00:15:39,713
And make you guys
scrambled eggs and salami.

349
00:15:40,492 --> 00:15:44,868
<i>It's the perfect meal
for apr??s l'amour.</i>

350
00:15:45,877 --> 00:15:48,360
Oh, kill me.

351
00:15:48,427 --> 00:15:51,218
By the way, I couldn't help
overhearing your big finish.

352
00:15:51,272 --> 00:15:52,794
Bravo, leonard.

353
00:15:56,066 --> 00:15:58,062
See, if you had killed me
when I said "kill me,"

354
00:15:58,132 --> 00:15:59,359
I wouldn't have had
to hear that.
(stammers)

355
00:16:00,343 --> 00:16:01,499
What do you guys think?

356
00:16:01,569 --> 00:16:02,689
Want to take
in a matinee,

357
00:16:02,753 --> 00:16:03,997
Maybe go
rollerblading,

358
00:16:04,055 --> 00:16:05,107
Catch a step class?

359
00:16:06,259 --> 00:16:07,828
Do something.

360
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:08,950
Okay.

361
00:16:09,003 --> 00:16:11,391
Um, howard, we
need to talk.

362
00:16:11,473 --> 00:16:13,191
Sure. 'sup, holmes?

363
00:16:14,439 --> 00:16:16,587
Uh... Please understand

364
00:16:16,687 --> 00:16:18,820
That it's not that we
don't want you around,

365
00:16:18,903 --> 00:16:21,289
But Penny and I
occasionally need some...

366
00:16:22,654 --> 00:16:23,579
Alone time.

367
00:16:25,227 --> 00:16:25,993
Oh.

368
00:16:27,567 --> 00:16:30,404
I-I get it, I'm the third wheel.

369
00:16:30,475 --> 00:16:31,395
(chuckles)

370
00:16:31,484 --> 00:16:32,895
Sorry, i should have seen that.

371
00:16:32,977 --> 00:16:34,288
I'll get out
of your way.

372
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:37,928
Uh, you're gonna want

373
00:16:38,004 --> 00:16:39,647
To eat those eggs
while they're still hot.

374
00:16:39,736 --> 00:16:40,856
Thank you.

375
00:16:42,388 --> 00:16:45,471
There's loand cream cheese
in the fridge.

376
00:16:45,544 --> 00:16:46,785
The bagels are in the oven.

377
00:16:50,085 --> 00:16:52,869
That's great.

378
00:16:52,997 --> 00:16:55,121
I'm just going to hang out
with my mom

379
00:16:55,167 --> 00:16:56,450
That's always fun

380
00:16:58,106 --> 00:16:59,260
Good.

381
00:17:06,556 --> 00:17:07,999
Are we terrible people?

382
00:17:08,063 --> 00:17:08,990
I don't know.

383
00:17:09,768 --> 00:17:10,732
What do you
want me to do?

384
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:12,292
(stammers)

385
00:17:12,403 --> 00:17:14,330
G-get him;
bring him back.

386
00:17:14,374 --> 00:17:15,996
Are you sure?

387
00:17:16,084 --> 00:17:18,760
Yeah.     Okay.

388
00:17:19,115 --> 00:17:20,029
Howard come back.

389
00:17:20,101 --> 00:17:21,918
Oh, you guys had me scared
for a minute.

390
00:17:25,995 --> 00:17:27,022
No, no, no, no!

391
00:17:27,082 --> 00:17:28,178
That rate is much too low

392
00:17:28,249 --> 00:17:29,676
From what we'd expect
from this collision.

393
00:17:29,752 --> 00:17:30,598
Do you understand

394
00:17:30,693 --> 00:17:31,650
We're talking
about dark matter

395
00:17:31,736 --> 00:17:33,422
Colliding in outer space?

396
00:17:33,490 --> 00:17:34,813
Of course I understand.

397
00:17:34,905 --> 00:17:37,038
<i>And who are you to tell me
about outer space?</i>

398
00:17:37,086 --> 00:17:38,489
I'm the astrophysicist.

399
00:17:38,683 --> 00:17:39,908
"astro" means "space."

400
00:17:41,238 --> 00:17:42,565
"astor" means "star."

401
00:17:43,991 --> 00:17:45,348
Okay, well, let
me just tell you,

402
00:17:45,436 --> 00:17:46,641
If we we having
this argument

403
00:17:46,703 --> 00:17:48,652
In my native language,
I'd be kicking your butt.

404
00:17:50,350 --> 00:17:51,958
<i>English is
your native language.</i>

405
00:17:54,558 --> 00:17:56,610
Okay, you got me there, but
you're wrong about this!

406
00:17:57,780 --> 00:18:00,100
There is a fine line
between wrong and visionary.

407
00:18:00,185 --> 00:18:02,131
Unfortunately you have to be
a visionary to see it.

408
00:18:03,805 --> 00:18:05,949
My god, you think
that every thought

409
00:18:06,055 --> 00:18:07,844
That comes out of your
head is pure gold.

410
00:18:07,929 --> 00:18:09,021
Well, let me tell
you something.

411
00:18:09,097 --> 00:18:10,707
Some of those thoughts
are pure caca.

412
00:18:10,793 --> 00:18:11,772
Caca

413
00:18:12,609 --> 00:18:13,655
It means "doo-doo."

414
00:18:13,731 --> 00:18:15,000
All right!

415
00:18:15,644 --> 00:18:17,026
First of all,
dr. Koothrappali,

416
00:18:17,111 --> 00:18:18,821
When I first proposed
that you work with me..

417
00:18:18,893 --> 00:18:20,740
Aha! So I am
working with you.

418
00:18:20,821 --> 00:18:23,123
In this context,
"with me" means for me."

419
00:18:24,015 --> 00:18:25,078
Ah, well, in
this context...

420
00:18:25,192 --> 00:18:27,304
Oh!

421
00:18:28,202 --> 00:18:29,946
If I'm wrong,
prove it.

422
00:18:30,044 --> 00:18:31,135
Okay.

423
00:18:31,254 --> 00:18:34,942
Here's where we derivthe mass
of the dark matter particle.

424
00:18:35,565 --> 00:18:37,058
You've misstated the
atomic weight of the target.

425
00:18:37,162 --> 00:18:38,552
Let me finish.
You're defacing  work.

426
00:18:38,638 --> 00:18:40,292
I'm not defacing it,
I'm fixing it.

427
00:18:40,404 --> 00:18:42,048
Give me the eraser.
No.

428
00:18:42,139 --> 00:18:43,605
I said give it to me.

429
00:18:43,682 --> 00:18:45,291
Come and get it.

430
00:18:46,758 --> 00:18:48,025
Fine.

431
00:18:51,569 --> 00:18:52,742
Oh, lord.

432
00:18:55,015 --> 00:18:56,224
Dr. Koothrappali,

433
00:18:56,297 --> 00:18:58,857
As your superior, I forbid you
from writing on my board!

434
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:00,316
You are not my superior.

435
00:19:00,406 --> 00:19:01,796
I am in every way.

436
00:19:01,851 --> 00:19:02,792
Oh, yeah?

437
00:19:02,875 --> 00:19:03,994
Can you do this?

438
00:19:09,049 --> 00:19:10,268
Nice working with you.

439
00:19:13,316 --> 00:19:15,450
<i>I'm sorry-- for you.</i>

440
00:19:36,582 --> 00:19:37,271
Raj...

441
00:19:37,550 --> 00:19:39,882
Raj... Raj...

442
00:19:42,507 --> 00:19:43,334
I'm busy.

443
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:44,497
Doing what?

444
00:19:48,172 --> 00:19:49,532
All right,
you've made your point.

445
00:19:49,596 --> 00:19:50,720
What do you want, sheldon?

446
00:19:50,818 --> 00:19:52,078
I looked overr the board

447
00:19:52,158 --> 00:19:53,614
And it turns out
you were right.

448
00:19:54,371 --> 00:19:55,873
So you were wrong.
I didn't say that.

449
00:19:55,955 --> 00:19:57,203
That's the only
logical inference.

450
00:19:57,295 --> 00:19:58,641
Nevertheless,
I didn't say it.

451
00:20:00,244 --> 00:20:02,997
Anyway, I would like you to come
back and work for me.

452
00:20:03,113 --> 00:20:05,128
<i>For you or with you?</i>

453
00:20:06,156 --> 00:20:09,224
In this context "for me"
could mean "with me."

454
00:20:09,713 --> 00:20:10,855
All right, but I have
some conditions.

455
00:20:10,913 --> 00:20:12,299
I reject them all.
I'll take the job.

456
00:20:14,248 --> 00:20:15,473
See you Monday.

457
00:20:15,589 --> 00:20:18,171
Wait, you have
to drive me home.

458
00:20:18,257 --> 00:20:19,668
How did you get here?
I walked.

459
00:20:19,799 --> 00:20:20,904
So walk home.
I can't.

460
00:20:20,980 --> 00:20:22,606
There's a big dog outside.

461
00:20:27,867 --> 00:20:29,638
On the way home,
we can start thinking

462
00:20:29,702 --> 00:20:31,402
About methods
of optimizing the detector

463
00:20:31,486 --> 00:20:33,455
For 500 gev particles.

464
00:20:33,502 --> 00:20:34,632
All right.

465
00:20:34,713 --> 00:20:37,837
