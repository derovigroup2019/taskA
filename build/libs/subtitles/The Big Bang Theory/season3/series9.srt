1
00:00:01,567 --> 00:00:03,900
So two years later,
there's a knock on the door.

2
00:00:03,967 --> 00:00:06,034
Guy opens it, and there on his porch
 is the snail

3
00:00:06,101 --> 00:00:08,067
who says, "What the heck
was all that about?"

4
00:00:08,134 --> 00:00:10,134
(both laughing)

5
00:00:11,434 --> 00:00:13,301
I don't really get it.

6
00:00:13,368 --> 00:00:16,567
Well, see, it took two
years for the snail ...

7
00:00:20,368 --> 00:00:22,767
Not important.

8
00:00:22,767 --> 00:00:25,401
Can I ask you a question?
Sure.

9
00:00:25,401 --> 00:00:27,234
Where do you think
this is going?

10
00:00:28,667 --> 00:00:31,567
To be honest, I was hoping
at least second base.

11
00:00:32,934 --> 00:00:34,533
You're so funny.

12
00:00:35,234 --> 00:00:37,900
You're like
a stand-up comedian.

13
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:40,867
A Jewish stand-up comedian,
that'd be new.

14
00:00:41,767 --> 00:00:45,867
Actually, I think a lot
of them are Jewish.

15
00:00:45,867 --> 00:00:49,800
No, I was just...
Never mind.

16
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:54,567
Look, Howard, this is our third date.
We both know what that means.

17
00:00:54,567 --> 00:00:57,500
We do?
Sex.

18
00:00:59,667 --> 00:01:01,600
You're kidding.

19
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:04,267
But I need to know
whether you're looking

20
00:01:04,267 --> 00:01:07,067
for a relationship
or a one-night stand.

21
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:08,867
Okay, just to be clear:

22
00:01:08,867 --> 00:01:11,834
there's only one
correct answer, right?

23
00:01:11,834 --> 00:01:14,567
It's not like "chicken
or fish" on an airplane?

24
00:01:14,567 --> 00:01:16,800
Maybe you need to think
about it a little.

25
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:18,900
You know,
it's not unheard of

26
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:21,967
for a one-night stand to turn
into a relationship.

27
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:27,201
Call me when you figure it out.

28
00:01:29,434 --> 00:01:32,900
Three dates means sex?

29
00:01:36,567 --> 00:01:38,934
Who knew?

30
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:44,334
Greetings, homies.

31
00:01:45,534 --> 00:01:46,833
Homette.

32
00:01:47,233 --> 00:01:49,701
Why are you back from
your date so early?

33
00:01:49,701 --> 00:01:52,500
In romance,
as in show business,

34
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:54,967
always leave them wanting more.

35
00:01:56,267 --> 00:01:58,600
What exactly
does that mean?

36
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:00,600
He struck out.

37
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:04,168
* Our whole universe
was in a hot, dense state *

38
00:02:04,168 --> 00:02:07,434
* Then nearly 14 billion years
ago expansion started... Wait! *

39
00:02:07,434 --> 00:02:09,068
* The Ear began to cool

40
00:02:09,068 --> 00:02:11,534
* The autotrophs began to drool,
Neanderthals developed tools *

41
00:02:11,534 --> 00:02:14,168
<i>* We built the Wall
We built the pyramids *</i>

42
00:02:14,168 --> 00:02:16,801
* Math, Science, History,
unraveling the mystery *

43
00:02:16,801 --> 00:02:18,667
* That all started
with a big bang *

44
00:02:18,667 --> 00:02:20,600
<i>* Bang! *</i>

46
00:02:27,067 --> 00:02:28,867
Hey, did either
of you guys know

47
00:02:28,867 --> 00:02:30,434
that three dates
with the same woman

48
00:02:30,434 --> 00:02:32,301
is the threshold for sex?

49
00:02:32,301 --> 00:02:35,334
Actually, I've never had three dates with
the same woman.

50
00:02:36,167 --> 00:02:38,833
With Penny and me,
it took two years.

51
00:02:38,833 --> 00:02:42,634
Now that I think about it,
that was three dates.

52
00:02:42,634 --> 00:02:45,367
Okay, well, before you
and Penny hooked up,

53
00:02:45,367 --> 00:02:47,800
did she ask for any
kind of commitment?

54
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,900
No, she was pretty clear about

55
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:52,668
wanting to keep
her options open.

56
00:02:52,668 --> 00:02:54,934
I have something to announce,

57
00:02:54,934 --> 00:02:57,367
but out of respect for convention,
 I will wait for you

58
00:02:57,367 --> 00:02:59,134
To finish your
current conversation.

59
00:02:59,134 --> 00:03:00,767
What are you
talking about?

60
00:03:00,767 --> 00:03:02,934
The cultural paradigm
in which people have sex

61
00:03:02,934 --> 00:03:04,234
after three dates.

62
00:03:04,234 --> 00:03:05,534
I see.

63
00:03:05,534 --> 00:03:07,700
Now, are we talking "date,"
the social interaction,

64
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:10,134
or "date,"
the dried fruit?

65
00:03:12,267 --> 00:03:14,800
Never mind,
what's your announcement?

66
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:17,234
Oh, good, my turn.
Well, this is very exciting

67
00:03:17,234 --> 00:03:19,767
and I wanted you to be
among the first to know...

68
00:03:19,767 --> 00:03:21,767
Hey, Cooper. I hear you’re going
To be on the radio

69
00:03:21,767 --> 00:03:23,367
<i>with Ira Flatow
from Science Friday next week.</i>

70
00:03:23,367 --> 00:03:26,934
Thank you, Kripke, for depriving
me of the opportunity

71
00:03:26,934 --> 00:03:29,134
<i>to share my news
with my friends.</i>

72
00:03:29,134 --> 00:03:31,034
My pleasure.

73
00:03:31,034 --> 00:03:32,833
My "thank you"
was not sincere.

74
00:03:32,833 --> 00:03:35,201
But "my pleasure" is.

75
00:03:35,201 --> 00:03:36,867
Let me ask you

76
00:03:36,867 --> 00:03:40,167
a question:  at what point
did National Public Radio

77
00:03:40,167 --> 00:03:42,067
have to start scraping
the bottom of the barrel

78
00:03:42,067 --> 00:03:43,733
for its guests

79
00:03:43,733 --> 00:03:46,501
Don't answer.
It's rhetorical.

80
00:03:46,501 --> 00:03:49,601
Why are you such a stupid head?

81
00:03:50,334 --> 00:03:53,267
That is also rhetorical.

82
00:03:54,267 --> 00:03:56,668
I'm sorry you had to hear that.

83
00:03:58,168 --> 00:04:00,233
Are you really
going to be on NPR?

84
00:04:00,233 --> 00:04:03,134
Yes, they're interviewing me
by phone from my office,

85
00:04:03,134 --> 00:04:05,134
regarding the recent so-called
"discovery"

86
00:04:05,134 --> 00:04:07,434
of magnetic monopoles
in spin-ices.

87
00:04:07,434 --> 00:04:10,134
It's pledge week and they're
trying to goose the ratings

88
00:04:10,134 --> 00:04:11,901
with a little controversy.

89
00:04:12,701 --> 00:04:14,300
Very cool,
congratulations.

90
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:16,500
Thank you.
My mother is very excited.

91
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:19,333
<i>She's convening her Bible study
group to listen in,</i>

92
00:04:19,333 --> 00:04:21,767
and then pray for my soul.

93
00:04:22,701 --> 00:04:24,068
I was on the radio once.

94
00:04:24,068 --> 00:04:26,333
I called in
to Fever 104 FM New Delhi

95
00:04:26,333 --> 00:04:28,734
and was the fourth person
to say the phrase that pays:

96
00:04:28,734 --> 00:04:32,367
<i>"Fever 104, aajke naye
acchha sangeetka ghar."</i>

97
00:04:33,967 --> 00:04:36,701
That means: "Fever 104,

98
00:04:36,701 --> 00:04:39,200
home of the really
good current music."

99
00:04:41,834 --> 00:04:43,467
It's much catchier
in Hindi.

100
00:04:46,634 --> 00:04:50,001
All right. These are
the talking points

101
00:04:50,001 --> 00:04:52,600
for  NPR
interview tomorrow.

102
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:54,567
I need to make sure
that they're simple enough

103
00:04:54,567 --> 00:04:57,734
for the less educated in
the audience to understand.

104
00:04:57,734 --> 00:05:00,867
Howard, look this over
and tell me what’s unclear to you.

105
00:05:01,868 --> 00:05:03,867
Excuse me, I have a master's degree
 in engineering

106
00:05:03,867 --> 00:05:05,934
from the Massachusetts Institute
of Technology.

107
00:05:05,934 --> 00:05:08,600
It required the completion
of 144 units of grad work

108
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:10,001
<i>and an original thesis.</i>

109
00:05:10,001 --> 00:05:12,567
Yes.

110
00:05:12,567 --> 00:05:15,068
Look this over and tell me what's
unclear to you.

111
00:05:16,934 --> 00:05:18,701
You know, when Sheldon
gives you homework,

112
00:05:18,701 --> 00:05:20,567
you don't have to do it.

113
00:05:20,567 --> 00:05:22,233
In fact, it's better
if you don't,

114
00:05:22,233 --> 00:05:24,434
otherwise it makes
the rest of us look bad.

115
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,967
Hi, guys.
Hey. Hello.

116
00:05:27,967 --> 00:05:29,434
Yo, Raj, talk to me.

117
00:05:37,467 --> 00:05:39,300
I'm sorry,
just screwing with you.

118
00:05:42,134 --> 00:05:44,734
Hey, Howard, why haven't
you called Bernadette?

119
00:05:44,734 --> 00:05:46,201
Did she say something?

120
00:05:46,201 --> 00:05:47,867
Yeah, she said she hasn't
heard from you in a week.

121
00:05:47,867 --> 00:05:49,001
I thought you liked her?

122
00:05:49,001 --> 00:05:51,368
I do, but she wants a commitment

123
00:05:51,368 --> 00:05:53,767
and I'm not sure she's my type.

124
00:05:53,767 --> 00:05:55,368
She agreed to go out
with you for free.

125
00:05:55,368 --> 00:05:57,001
What more do you need?

126
00:05:57,001 --> 00:05:59,368
Look, Bernadette is really nice.

127
00:05:59,368 --> 00:06:01,600
I just always thought
when I finally settle down

128
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,734
into a relationship,
it would be with someone,

129
00:06:03,734 --> 00:06:05,467
you know, different.

130
00:06:05,467 --> 00:06:06,934
Different how?

131
00:06:06,934 --> 00:06:11,034
<i>Well, you know, more like
Men Fox from Transformers.</i>

132
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:13,567
Or Katee Sackhoff

133
00:06:13,567 --> 00:06:15,467
<i>from Battlestar Galactica.</i>

134
00:06:15,467 --> 00:06:17,834
Are you high?

135
00:06:18,801 --> 00:06:20,367
You'd have a better shot
with the three-breasted

136
00:06:20,367 --> 00:06:22,768
<i>Martian hooker
from Total Recall.</i>

137
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,667
Okay, now you're just
being unrealistic.

138
00:06:27,567 --> 00:06:29,167
Anyway, that movie
was like 20 years ago.

139
00:06:29,167 --> 00:06:31,801
Imagine how saggy
those things would be.

140
00:06:36,067 --> 00:06:39,167
Howard, you're going
to throw ay a great girl like Bernadette

141
00:06:39,167 --> 00:06:41,768
because you're holding out
for some ridiculous fantasy?

142
00:06:41,768 --> 00:06:45,634
Hey, just because you settled
doesn't mean I have to.

143
00:06:47,033 --> 00:06:49,401
Excuse me,
I'm sitting here.

144
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:52,434
Hey, I did not
settle for Leonard.

145
00:06:52,434 --> 00:06:56,534
I mean, obviously, he isn't the kind of guy
I usually go out with...

146
00:06:56,534 --> 00:06:58,900
You know, physically.

147
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:01,167
Again, I'm right here.

148
00:07:02,134 --> 00:07:04,234
My point is, I do not
judge a book by its cover.

149
00:07:04,234 --> 00:07:05,868
I am interested
in the person underneath.

150
00:07:05,868 --> 00:07:08,234
I am here, right?
You see me.

151
00:07:13,334 --> 00:07:17,434
Hey, I'm interested
in what's inside people, too,

152
00:07:17,434 --> 00:07:20,634
but why is it wrong to want
those insides wrapped up in,

153
00:07:20,634 --> 00:07:24,234
say, the delicious caramel
that is Halle Berry?

154
00:07:25,367 --> 00:07:28,567
Yes, you're delicious
caramel, too.

155
00:07:33,768 --> 00:07:35,067
All right, you know what,
I will tell you

156
00:07:35,067 --> 00:07:36,667
why it's wrong...
Excuse me, may I interject?

157
00:07:37,167 --> 00:07:38,167
What?

158
00:07:38,167 --> 00:07:40,001
Biologically speaking,

159
00:07:40,001 --> 00:07:42,967
Howard is perfectly justified
in seeking out the optimum mate

160
00:07:42,967 --> 00:07:45,600
for the propagation
of his genetic line.

161
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:47,767
Thank you, Sheldon.
Now, whether that

162
00:07:47,767 --> 00:07:49,901
propagation is in the interest
of humanity is, of course,

163
00:07:49,901 --> 00:07:51,700
an entirely different question.

164
00:07:54,867 --> 00:07:57,167
This is Ira Flatow
and you're listening

00:07:57,167 --> 00:08:00,034
<i>to NPR's Science Friday.</i>

168
00:08:03,901 --> 00:08:05,901

169
00:08:05,901 --> 00:08:08,634
Oh, this is going to be a riot.

170

FLATOW:
Thanks for being

171

My pleasure, Ira.

172
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:18,634
Now, let's talk about
magnetic monopoles.

173
00:08:18,634 --> 00:08:22,600
Can you explain to our audience
just what a monopole is?

174
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:23,734
Of course.

175
00:08:23,734 --> 00:08:28,067
First, consider an ordinary
magnet which has,

176
00:08:28,067 --> 00:08:29,667
(pitch raises):
as even the most uneducated

177
00:08:29,667 --> 00:08:32,400
in your audience
must know, two poles.

178
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:34,301
(clears throat)

179
00:08:34,301 --> 00:08:37,368
(pitch raises):
A north and south pole.

180
00:08:37,368 --> 00:08:40,834
If you cut that in half,
you have two smaller magnets,

181
00:08:40,834 --> 00:08:43,533
each with its own
north and south pole.

182
00:08:43,533 --> 00:08:46,500
Uh, Dr. Cooper,
I think there might be

183
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:47,967
something wrong
with our connection.

184
00:08:47,967 --> 00:08:51,268
(higher pitch):
No, I hear you fine.

185
00:08:51,268 --> 00:08:55,334
As I was saying, an ordinary
magnet has two poles.

186
00:08:55,334 --> 00:08:57,867
The primary characteristic
of a monopole

187
00:08:57,867 --> 00:09:01,368
is that it has only one pole,
hence, monopole.

188
00:09:02,867 --> 00:09:04,934
SHELDON (over radio):
A requirement for string theory,

189
00:09:04,934 --> 00:09:06,834
or M-they, if you will,

190
00:09:06,834 --> 00:09:09,567
is the existence
of such monopoles.

191
00:09:09,567 --> 00:09:11,767
I, myself, led an expedition

192
00:09:11,767 --> 00:09:13,834
to the Arctic Circle
in search of said particles.

193
00:09:13,834 --> 00:09:16,467
Kripke, I found the nozzle!
I'm going to kill you!

194
00:09:24,267 --> 00:09:26,334
So nice you could
join me this evening.

195
00:09:26,334 --> 00:09:28,501
You're looking lovely as always.

196
00:09:29,967 --> 00:09:31,200
Thanks, Howard.

197
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,967
Always nice to be part
of your masturbatory fantasies.

198
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,234
Come on, Katee

199
00:09:37,234 --> 00:09:38,900
Don't make it sound so cheap.

200
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:41,300
I'm sorry, fiddling
with yourself in the bathtub

201
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:43,100
is a real class act.

202
00:09:45,167 --> 00:09:46,734
Thank you.

203
00:09:46,734 --> 00:09:49,567
So, shall we get started?

204
00:09:50,634 --> 00:09:52,467
Sure.

205
00:09:52,467 --> 00:09:54,334
But can I ask you
a question first?

206
00:09:54,334 --> 00:09:56,734
Do you want to play
Cylon and colonist?

207
00:09:56,734 --> 00:09:58,067
No.

208
00:09:58,067 --> 00:09:59,868
I want to know why you're
playing make-believe with me

209
00:09:59,868 --> 00:10:01,734
when you could be out
with a real woman tonight.

210
00:10:02,234 --> 00:10:04,301
You mean, Bernadette?

211
00:10:04,301 --> 00:10:06,467
No, I mean Princess Leia.

212
00:10:06,467 --> 00:10:08,067
Of course
I mean Bernadette.

213
00:10:08,067 --> 00:10:11,201
She's a wonderful girl
and she really likes you.

214
00:10:11,201 --> 00:10:13,934
I know, but she's not you.

215
00:10:13,934 --> 00:10:16,167
I'm not me.

216
00:10:17,101 --> 00:10:18,167
The real me is in Beverly Hills

217
00:10:18,167 --> 00:10:19,834
going out with a tall,
handsome, rich guy.

218
00:10:19,834 --> 00:10:21,101
Really? Tall?

219
00:10:21,101 --> 00:10:22,501
Six-four.
Ouch.

220
00:10:24,302 --> 00:10:26,301
But come on, you got a wonderful
girl in your life

221
00:10:26,301 --> 00:10:28,234
and you're ignoring her
in order to spend your nights

222
00:10:28,234 --> 00:10:31,400
in the bathtub with mental
image and a wash cloth.

223
00:10:34,234 --> 00:10:35,900
MRS. WOLOWITZ: Howard!

224
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:38,067
What are you
doing in there?

225
00:10:38,067 --> 00:10:40,000
I'm taking a bath!

226
00:10:40,001 --> 00:10:42,000
I hope that's all you're doing.

227
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,100
We share that tub!

228
00:10:46,401 --> 00:10:48,567
Don't remind me!

229
00:10:51,167 --> 00:10:52,834
Oh, man.

230
00:10:52,834 --> 00:10:56,501
All soaped up
and no place to go.

231
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:02,167
(knocking at door)

232
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:05,734
How ya doin', buddy?

233
00:11:05,734 --> 00:11:08,234
I was humiliated
on national radio.

234
00:11:08,234 --> 00:11:09,400
How do you think I'm doing?

235
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:11,167
Come on, it wasn't
that bad.

236
00:11:11,167 --> 00:11:12,867
(sighs):
What do you want?

237
00:11:12,867 --> 00:11:15,001
We represent
the Lollipop Guild,

238
00:11:15,001 --> 00:11:17,134
and we want you.

239
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:24,734
Okay, so Kripke
played a joke on you.

240
00:11:24,734 --> 00:11:26,001
It wasn't funny.

241
00:11:26,001 --> 00:11:28,034
I thought it was funny.
Raj.

242
00:11:28,034 --> 00:11:29,368
You laughed.

243
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,134
Did you laugh?

244
00:11:33,533 --> 00:11:35,533
I fell on the floor.

245
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:38,933
All right, he got you.

246
00:11:38,933 --> 00:11:40,300
You can get him back.

247
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:42,501
I refuse to sink to his level.

248
00:11:42,501 --> 00:11:44,634
You can't sink. 
With all that helium in you

249
00:11:44,634 --> 00:11:46,801
you're lucky you don't
(high pitched): float away.

250
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:53,300
Are you really admitting defeat?
I’m never admitting defeat.

251
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:54,434
Good.

252
00:11:54,434 --> 00:11:55,667
However, on an unrelated topic,

253
00:11:55,667 --> 00:11:58,501
I am never getting out
of this bed again.

254
00:11:58,501 --> 00:12:00,567
What if you could
make Kripke

255
00:12:00,567 --> 00:12:02,434
look even sillier
than he made you look?

256
00:12:02,434 --> 00:12:03,601
I don't think
that's possible, dude.

257
00:12:03,601 --> 00:12:05,000
You're not helping.

258
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,000
I didn't come to help,
I came to mock.

259
00:12:09,267 --> 00:12:11,567
Sheldon, what you need to do
is figure out a way

260
00:12:12,067 --> 00:12:14,867
to exact vengeance on Kripke,
like, uh

261
00:12:14,867 --> 00:12:18,268
like, how the Joker got back
at Batman for putting him

262
00:12:18,268 --> 00:12:21,234
in the Arkham Asylum for the Criminally Insane.
That's true.

263
00:12:21,234 --> 00:12:22,901
He didn't just stay there
and talk about his feelings

264
00:12:22,901 --> 00:12:24,268
with the other
psychotic villains.

265
00:12:24,268 --> 00:12:27,667
He, he broke out and poisoned
Gotham's water supply.

266
00:12:29,667 --> 00:12:31,433
Well...

267
00:12:31,433 --> 00:12:33,567
I suppose I could poison Kripke.
No!

268
00:12:33,567 --> 00:12:35,001
No.
It's a simple matter.

269
00:12:35,001 --> 00:12:36,500
There are several toxic
chemicals

270
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:39,467
that'd be untraceable
in an autopsy.

271
00:12:40,433 --> 00:12:42,834
Okay, uh, that's the spirit,

272
00:12:42,834 --> 00:12:45,167
but, um, let's dial it back

273
00:12:45,167 --> 00:12:48,234
to a non-lethal form
of vengeance.

274
00:12:49,234 --> 00:12:50,567
Oh!

275
00:12:51,567 --> 00:12:54,600
How about we whoopee cushion
on his office chair?

276
00:12:55,734 --> 00:12:56,934
He'll sit down,
it'll sound like

277
00:12:56,934 --> 00:12:59,368
he's flatulent,
even though he's not.

278
00:13:01,167 --> 00:13:02,767
Let's keep thinking.

279
00:13:07,134 --> 00:13:08,934
Oh, gee,
you're too late.

280
00:13:08,934 --> 00:13:11,268
Scarlett Johansson and
Wonder Woman were just in here

281
00:13:11,268 --> 00:13:14,067
trolling around for
neurotic, little weasels.

282
00:13:14,567 --> 00:13:17,401
I came to talk to Bernadette.
She's working today, right?

283
00:13:17,401 --> 00:13:19,900
Yes, but I don't think
she wants to see you.

284
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:20,900
Why not?

285
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:22,567
Come on, Howard.
You hurt her feelings

286
00:13:22,567 --> 00:13:24,000
by not calling her all week.

287
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,334
Plus, I've kind of been
talkin' some smack about ya.

288
00:13:28,167 --> 00:13:29,300
Hello, Howard.

289
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:31,401
Wait, Bernadette,
I need to talk to you.

290
00:13:31,401 --> 00:13:32,501
I can't now, I'm working.

291
00:13:32,501 --> 00:13:34,033
This will only take a second.

292
00:13:34,033 --> 00:13:35,768
You asked me
to think about where

293
00:13:35,768 --> 00:13:38,634
our relationship
was going, and I did.

294
00:13:39,567 --> 00:13:41,367
Bernadette?

295
00:13:45,134 --> 00:13:47,567
Will you marry me?

296
00:13:49,234 --> 00:13:52,534
Is this more comedy
that I don't understand?

297
00:13:52,534 --> 00:13:55,467
No. I'm serious.

298
00:13:55,467 --> 00:13:58,000
I'm never going to find
another girl like you

299
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,834
who likes me and is,
you know, real.

300
00:14:03,834 --> 00:14:05,234
So, this isn't a joke?

301
00:14:05,234 --> 00:14:07,900
No.
Then you're insane.

302
00:14:09,067 --> 00:14:12,467
I prefer to think
of myself as quirky.

303
00:14:12,467 --> 00:14:14,801
Howard, we've only
been on three dates.

304
00:14:14,801 --> 00:14:16,868
We haven't even had sex yet.

305
00:14:16,868 --> 00:14:18,033
Fair enough.

306
00:14:18,033 --> 00:14:20,100
When's your break?

307
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:22,234
Wow.

308
00:14:24,634 --> 00:14:27,967
Don't you just hate
when this happens?

309
00:14:27,967 --> 00:14:30,401
Wow.

310
00:14:34,167 --> 00:14:38,234
All right,
how's this for revenge?

311
00:14:38,234 --> 00:14:40,634
A solution of
hydrogen peroxide,

312
00:14:40,634 --> 00:14:44,000
and one of saturated
potassium iodide.

313
00:14:44,201 --> 00:14:45,201
What's this?

314
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:47,467
Mountain Dew.

315
00:14:49,601 --> 00:14:51,667
Ahh, refreshing.

316
00:14:51,667 --> 00:14:53,734
Now, we're going to
combine these chemicals

317
00:14:53,734 --> 00:14:55,067
with ordinary dish soap,

318
00:14:55,067 --> 00:14:59,534
<i>creating a little exothermic
release of oxygen.</i>

319
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:05,033
(all exclaiming)

320
00:15:11,201 --> 00:15:12,667
Foamy vengeance.

321
00:15:12,667 --> 00:15:13,901
Yes, exactly.

322
00:15:13,901 --> 00:15:16,001
This is brilliant, Sheldon.

323
00:15:16,001 --> 00:15:18,001
How are we going to deploy it
in Kripke's office?

324
00:15:18,001 --> 00:15:19,834
Already taken care of.

325
00:15:19,834 --> 00:15:22,134
Observe.
(typing)

326
00:15:22,835 --> 00:15:25,335
This is a live shot of Kripke's lab

327
00:15:25,335 --> 00:15:28,500
via a mini webcam I was able to install,
thanks to a dollar bill

328
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:31,267
discreetly placed in the night
janitor's shirt pocket.

329
00:15:31,267 --> 00:15:32,601
At the same time,

330
00:15:32,601 --> 00:15:34,667
I also secured large quantities

331
00:15:34,667 --> 00:15:37,701
of these chemicals above
the tiles in the drop ceiling.

332
00:15:37,701 --> 00:15:39,300
Oh, Sheldon,

333
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:41,100
you remind me
of a young Lex Luthor.

334
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:42,434
(chuckles)

335
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:45,367
You flatter me, sir.

336
00:15:46,868 --> 00:15:46,367
- Let me guess. Motion sensors?
- Yes.

337
00:15:48,367 --> 00:15:50,200
The reaction will be triggered

338
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:52,267
when Kripke reaches
the center of the room.

339
00:15:52,267 --> 00:15:54,434
Mwa, ha, ha.

340
00:15:56,933 --> 00:15:59,667
I gotta say,
I am really impressed.

341
00:15:59,667 --> 00:16:02,467
This is truly the Sheldon Cooper
way to get even.

342
00:16:02,467 --> 00:16:04,601
(whoopee cushion expels)

343
00:16:08,368 --> 00:16:10,400
It may be low-tech

344
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:13,101
but I still maintain the whoopee
cushion has comic validity.

345
00:16:14,734 --> 00:16:16,234
Here comes Kripke!

346
00:16:16,234 --> 00:16:17,934
LEONARD:
Who is that with him?

347
00:16:17,934 --> 00:16:20,734
KOOTHRAPPALI:
I believe that's
the president of the university.

348
00:16:20,734 --> 00:16:22,467
And the board of directors.
Abort! Abort!

349
00:16:22,467 --> 00:16:23,600
There is no "abort."

350
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,134
How could you not put in
an "abort?"

351
00:16:25,134 --> 00:16:27,500
I made a boo-boo, all right?

352
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:29,334
KRIPKE:
I think the board
will really appreciate

353
00:16:29,334 --> 00:16:32,201
how well we're using that
NSA grant, President Seibert.

354
00:16:32,201 --> 00:16:34,433
Right here we have
a micro-controlled plasma...

355
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:44,667
Wow. Looks like the
Ganges on laundry day.

356
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,768
At least they don't know
it was you.

357
00:16:49,768 --> 00:16:51,234
(chiming)

358
00:16:51,234 --> 00:16:52,768
SHELDON (on computer):
Hello, Kripke.

359
00:16:52,768 --> 00:16:55,100
This classic prank
comes to you

360
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:58,734
from the malevolent mind
of Sheldon Cooper.

361
00:16:58,734 --> 00:17:00,501
If you'd like to see the look

362
00:17:00,501 --> 00:17:03,100
on your stupid face,
this video is being

363
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:05,601
instantly uploaded to YouTube.

364
00:17:05,601 --> 00:17:08,367
Oh, and a hat tip
to Leonard Hofstadter

365
00:17:08,367 --> 00:17:11,534
And Raj Koothrappali
for their support

366
00:17:12,034 --> 00:17:14,900
and encouragement
in this enterprise.

367
00:17:17,467 --> 00:17:18,768
Well, I'm going back to India.

368
00:17:18,769 --> 00:17:19,769
What's your plan?

369
00:17:26,201 --> 00:17:27,800
Hey, he's your tip
from table seven.

370
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:29,134
Oh, thanks
Mm-hmm.

371
00:17:29,134 --> 00:17:30,301
WOLOWITZ:
Testing. Check.

372
00:17:30,301 --> 00:17:31,600
Check two.

373
00:17:32,767 --> 00:17:34,301
Oh, now what?

374
00:17:34,301 --> 00:17:36,001
You want me
to throw him out?

375
00:17:36,001 --> 00:17:37,167
No, that's okay.

376
00:17:37,167 --> 00:17:39,600
Are you sure? He's small.

377
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:42,101
I bet I can get a nice,
tight spiral on him.

378
00:17:43,433 --> 00:17:45,368
I want to dedicate this number

379
00:17:45,368 --> 00:17:48,201
to a great gal
who I've done wrong.

380
00:17:50,001 --> 00:17:53,368
(plays The Four Tops "Bernadette")
* Bernadette

381
00:17:53,368 --> 00:17:56,201
* I am so sorry for

382
00:17:56,201 --> 00:17:58,567
* Trying to propose to you

383
00:17:59,567 --> 00:18:01,767
* Bernadette

384
00:18:01,767 --> 00:18:04,101
* You found it creepy

385
00:18:04,101 --> 00:18:07,967
* But that's just
the kind of thing I  do*

386
00:18:07,967 --> 00:18:10,101
* Ahh...

387
00:18:10,101 --> 00:18:14,001
* I know now it was too soon
to talk of love *

388
00:18:14,001 --> 00:18:18,201
* It was just a crazy idea that
came to me in my tub *

389
00:18:18,201 --> 00:18:21,134
* But, Bernadette,
give me one more chance *

390
00:18:21,134 --> 00:18:22,400
(falsetto):
* Sweet Bernadette

391
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:24,101
* I'll get the hang
of this thing *

392
00:18:24,101 --> 00:18:26,134
* They call romance, Sweet Bernadette,

393
00:18:26,134 --> 00:18:28,234
I dream to once again *

394
00:18:28,234 --> 00:18:30,901
* Kiss your lips,
Sweet Bernadette *

395
00:18:30,901 --> 00:18:32,533
* Sincerely yours

396
00:18:32,533 --> 00:18:34,734
* Howard Wolowitz

397
00:18:34,734 --> 00:18:36,101
* Bernadette...

398
00:18:36,101 --> 00:18:40,034
Oh, I am so sorry.
Are you kidding?

399
00:18:40,034 --> 00:18:43,201
That's the most romantic thing
anyone's ever done for me.

400
00:18:43,201 --> 00:18:45,934
* Bernadette!
Thank you, Cheesecake Factory!
