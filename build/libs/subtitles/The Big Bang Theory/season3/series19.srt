Hey, Leonard,
where do you come down on giant ants?

30
00:02:09,337 --> 00:02:12,339
Sheldon says impossible,
Howard and I say not only possible...

31
00:02:12,507 --> 00:02:15,968
...but as a mode of transportation,
way cooler than the Batmobile.

32
00:02:16,845 --> 00:02:18,887
You are ignoring the square-cube law.

33
00:02:19,055 --> 00:02:22,391
The giant ant would be crushed
under the weight of its exoskeleton.

34
00:02:22,559 --> 00:02:26,061
For the record, the appropriate ranking
of cool modes of transportation...

35
00:02:26,229 --> 00:02:31,191
...is jetpack, hover board, transporter,
Batmobile and then giant ant.

36
00:02:32,485 --> 00:02:35,279
Seriously, you have nothing better
to do than sit around...

37
00:02:35,488 --> 00:02:38,907
...and discuss the possibility
of giant ants?

38
00:02:39,742 --> 00:02:42,369
-What's with him?
-Perhaps he's at a sensitive point...

39
00:02:42,537 --> 00:02:44,079
...in his monthly cycle.

40
00:02:46,374 --> 00:02:50,085
Are you saying he's man-struating?

41
00:02:51,087 --> 00:02:53,213
Not literally.

42
00:02:53,381 --> 00:02:55,424

43

...scientists observed a 33-day

to say something, but they never do.

Rabbits do have a respiratory system
that would support great size.

52
00:03:28,291 --> 00:03:30,792
On a side note,
they are one of the few mammals...

is in front of the penis.

to life as we know it on this planet?

171
00:10:56,489 --> 00:11:00,283
When she's upset,
she says "ack" and eats ice cream.

172
00:11:03,412 --> 00:11:05,205
Um....

173
00:11:05,373 --> 00:11:06,539
Ack.

174
00:11:08,584 --> 00:11:11,711
And if you were a cat,
I would have brought you a lasagna.

175
00:11:13,506 --> 00:11:15,382
Did Leonard send you over here?

176
00:11:15,591 --> 00:11:19,094
No. We haven't spoken
since your abrupt departure last night...

177
00:11:19,261 --> 00:11:22,806
...caused us to forfeit to Stuart
and his dastardly ringer, Wil Wheaton.

178
00:11:23,641 --> 00:11:24,933
Yeah, I'm sorry about that.

179
00:11:25,142 --> 00:11:28,395
Not too proud to admit
that I cried myself to sleep.

180
00:11:29,271 --> 00:11:31,064
-Again, I'm sorry.
-Let me tell you...

181
00:11:31,232 --> 00:11:32,732
...sleep did not come easily...

182
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:36,695
...with Leonard in the next room
singing along with Alanis Morissette.

183
00:11:38,698 --> 00:11:39,948
-You're kidding.
-No.

184
00:11:40,157 --> 00:11:42,534
Clearly another woman
in dire need of ice cream.

185
00:11:44,286 --> 00:11:46,913
What part of this is supposed
to make me feel better?

186
00:11:47,123 --> 00:11:50,291
The part where I tell you
I've engineered a rematch...

187
00:11:50,459 --> 00:11:52,168
...with Stuart's team for tonight.

188
00:11:52,378 --> 00:11:56,089
Oh, honey, I don't know. Things
are a little weird with Leonard right now.

189
00:11:56,590 --> 00:12:00,009
You want me to remove him from the team?
I'm the captain, I can do that.

190
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:05,265
No, no, that's okay. Just let me
talk to him and I'll get back to you.

191
00:12:06,392 --> 00:12:10,311
-When are you going to talk to him?
-I don't know.

192
00:12:10,521 --> 00:12:13,565
He's in the laundry room now.
Now would be a good time.

193
00:12:13,816 --> 00:12:15,775
You're not gonna leave me
until I do it?

194
00:12:15,985 --> 00:12:18,945
Oh, I think we both know
the answer to that question.

195
00:12:25,369 --> 00:12:29,247
-I think we should talk now.
-What? No, it's okay.

196
00:12:29,415 --> 00:12:32,292
We don't have to talk because
there's nothing to talk about.

197
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:34,836
-Everything's good.
-Really?

198
00:12:35,004 --> 00:12:36,337
So you didn't get snarky...

199
00:12:36,505 --> 00:12:39,549
...because I said something nice
to a bowl of chili fries?

200
00:12:40,843 --> 00:12:43,136
All right, maybe I overreacted.

201
00:12:43,304 --> 00:12:46,139
So we're in two different places,
emotionally. So what?

202
00:12:46,474 --> 00:12:49,184
And maybe I'm a little ahead of you,
and that's fine.

203
00:12:49,393 --> 00:12:51,728
In fact, it makes sense,
because let's face it...

204
00:12:51,896 --> 00:12:54,731
...I've been in this relationship
two years longer than you.

205
00:12:57,234 --> 00:13:00,320
Look, Leonard, you have to know
how much I care about you.

206
00:13:00,488 --> 00:13:03,406
It's just that I've said the L word
too soon before...

207
00:13:03,574 --> 00:13:05,283
...and it didn't work out very well.

208
00:13:05,701 --> 00:13:08,495
Really?
I wouldn't know what that's like.

209
00:13:09,205 --> 00:13:10,413
I'm sorry.

210
00:13:10,581 --> 00:13:12,791
-You know what I'm talking about.
-Yeah, I do.

211
00:13:14,251 --> 00:13:17,212
-So we're good?
-Yes, that's what I'm telling you.

212
00:13:17,379 --> 00:13:19,088
We are good. We are great.

213
00:13:19,256 --> 00:13:22,550
All right. Fence mended,
problem swept under the rug.

214
00:13:22,718 --> 00:13:24,135
Time to bowl.

215
00:13:26,055 --> 00:13:28,348
Yes, I was eavesdropping.
There's a lot at stake.

216
00:13:31,602 --> 00:13:33,311
Attention, all bowlers...

217
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:38,316
...I've taken the liberty
of having these made for our rematch.

218
00:13:39,109 --> 00:13:41,694
-The Wesley Crushers?
-No, not the Wesley Crushers.

219
00:13:41,862 --> 00:13:44,030
The Wesley "Crushers."

220
00:13:44,448 --> 00:13:46,533
-I don't get it.
-Wesley Crusher...

221
00:13:46,742 --> 00:13:48,993
...was Wil Wheaton's character
on Star Trek.

222
00:13:49,161 --> 00:13:50,620
Still don't get it.

223
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:52,872
It's a blindingly clever play on words.

224
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:55,959
By appropriating his character's
name and adding the S...

225
00:13:56,126 --> 00:14:00,088
...we imply that we will be
the crushers of Wesley.

226
00:14:01,507 --> 00:14:03,466
I'm sorry, but the Wesley Crushers...

227
00:14:03,634 --> 00:14:05,927
...sounds like people
who like Wesley Crusher.

228
00:14:06,136 --> 00:14:08,179
No, again,
it's not the Wesley Crushers.

229
00:14:08,347 --> 00:14:10,515
It's the Wesley "Crushers."

230
00:14:12,434 --> 00:14:15,395
No, if you want it to mean
you're crushing Wesley...

231
00:14:15,563 --> 00:14:17,522
...it'd be the "Wesley" Crushers.

232
00:14:17,731 --> 00:14:20,817
Do you people even hear yourselves?
It's not the Wesley Crushers.

233
00:14:20,985 --> 00:14:25,029
It's not the "Wesley" Crushers,
it's Wesley "Crushers."

234
00:14:25,197 --> 00:14:27,740
Hey, look.
They named their team after me.

235
00:14:29,159 --> 00:14:31,953
No, it's not-- Never mind.

236
00:14:34,415 --> 00:14:37,750
So we're all clear on the bet
and the stakes?

237
00:14:37,918 --> 00:14:39,002
Oh, yes.

238
00:14:39,169 --> 00:14:43,339
The losers will be publicly humiliated
in a fashion to be chosen by the victor.

239
00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:47,260
FYI, I plan on having you
publish a scientific paper...

240
00:14:47,428 --> 00:14:50,638
...expounding the discredited
Belakovsky hypotheses.

241
00:14:52,474 --> 00:14:53,975
Ouch again.

242
00:14:56,186 --> 00:14:57,937
Hey, Sheldon.

243
00:14:58,314 --> 00:15:01,608
I wanted you to know I'm looking forward
to wiping the floor with you.

244
00:15:01,817 --> 00:15:05,820
Oh, yes? Well, before I respond,
let me ask you a question.

245
00:15:06,822 --> 00:15:09,949
Is your mother a good or poor bowler?

246
00:15:16,373 --> 00:15:19,083
-After you.
-No, after you.

247
00:15:19,251 --> 00:15:23,671
As we are currently crushing you,
Wesley.

248
00:15:25,799 --> 00:15:29,135
It's customary for the player
on the right-hand lane to bowl first.

249
00:15:31,305 --> 00:15:32,847
All right.

250
00:15:41,023 --> 00:15:42,565
It's a custom, not a rule.

251
00:15:43,817 --> 00:15:45,944
I so loathe you.

252
00:15:46,987 --> 00:15:50,156
That's right, Sheldon.
Embrace the dark side.

253
00:15:52,785 --> 00:15:55,995
That's not even from your franchise.

254
00:15:57,206 --> 00:16:01,834
I, um-- I want you to know that
even though we're on opposite sides...

255
00:16:02,002 --> 00:16:03,836
...I bear you no ill will.

256
00:16:05,047 --> 00:16:07,674
-Thank you, Stuart. It's nice to know.
-Mm-hm.

257
00:16:07,883 --> 00:16:10,843
People from opposite sides
often have good relationships.

258
00:16:11,053 --> 00:16:12,595
You know, Romeo and Juliet...

259
00:16:12,805 --> 00:16:16,140
...Tony and Maria from West Side Story.

260
00:16:16,725 --> 00:16:19,894
What's-his-name
and the big, blue chick in Avatar.

261
00:16:22,398 --> 00:16:24,399
I'm gonna bowl now.

262
00:16:26,819 --> 00:16:28,277
Be the ball, Howard.

263
00:16:28,821 --> 00:16:30,697
Leave me alone, Sheldon.

264
00:16:39,373 --> 00:16:40,748
You weren't the ball.

265
00:16:43,877 --> 00:16:45,461
Hey, thanks.

266
00:16:45,629 --> 00:16:47,380
-This is fun, huh?
-Yeah.

267
00:16:47,548 --> 00:16:49,382
It's good we got out
and did something physical.

268
00:16:49,591 --> 00:16:52,051
-Mm-hm.
-Gets us out of our heads.

269
00:16:52,219 --> 00:16:53,261
You get in your head...

270
00:16:53,429 --> 00:16:56,431
...you start to over-think, over-analyze,
obsess, you worry.

271
00:16:56,598 --> 00:17:00,018
That's not what we're doing tonight.
We're throwing a ball at some pins.

272
00:17:00,227 --> 00:17:01,436
-Yeah, that's right.
-Mm-hm.

273
00:17:01,645 --> 00:17:04,689
And someday, we don't know when,
maybe you'll love me back.

274
00:17:07,609 --> 00:17:09,402
Ooh. I'm up.

275
00:17:11,321 --> 00:17:14,657
ALL [CHANTING]:
Sheldon. Sheldon. Sheldon.

276
00:17:14,825 --> 00:17:15,950
Excuse me.

277
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:20,079
I don't know who you're chanting for,
as I am currently the ball.

278
00:17:22,332 --> 00:17:28,337
ALL [CHANTING]:
The ball. The ball. The ball.

279
00:17:31,216 --> 00:17:32,258
Thank you, Jesus!

280
00:17:35,137 --> 00:17:36,387
As my mother would say.

281
00:17:42,019 --> 00:17:44,645
I'm glad you patched things up
with your boyfriend.

282
00:17:44,813 --> 00:17:46,689
Yeah, me too.

283
00:17:46,857 --> 00:17:49,901
It's tough when the L bomb
gets dropped and you're not ready.

284
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:51,402
Tell me about it.

285
00:17:52,988 --> 00:17:56,074
I dated this one girl,
and I told her that I loved her...

286
00:17:56,533 --> 00:17:58,451
...and she said she wasn't sure.

287
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:02,580
And she strung me along
for almost two years. It was brutal.

288
00:18:03,123 --> 00:18:05,833
-Oh, I'm sorry.
-Thanks.

289
00:18:06,376 --> 00:18:08,753
I wish she had just broken up with me
right there.

290
00:18:09,421 --> 00:18:11,255
Put me out of my misery.

291
00:18:11,423 --> 00:18:13,549
-Really?
-Yeah. Would have been kinder.

292
00:18:14,009 --> 00:18:16,302
-Wil, you're up.
-Oh, that's me.

293
00:18:21,767 --> 00:18:23,726
Did you let Wil Wheaton
get in your head?

294
00:18:23,936 --> 00:18:26,104
-What are you talking about?
-He's evil.

295
00:18:26,271 --> 00:18:28,231
He plays evil mind games.

296
00:18:28,398 --> 00:18:30,733
-Did he tell you his grandmother died?
-No.

297
00:18:30,943 --> 00:18:34,987
If he does, don't believe it. He's not above
playing the dead meemaw card.

298
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:39,784
Yes!

299
00:18:40,953 --> 00:18:43,121
Enjoy the accolades now,
Wil Wheaton.

300
00:18:43,288 --> 00:18:45,748
But like your time on
Star Trek: Next Generation...

301
00:18:45,916 --> 00:18:48,501
...your smug self-satisfaction
will be short-lived.

302
00:18:50,379 --> 00:18:52,547
-Penny, you're up.
-All right, remember...

303
00:18:52,714 --> 00:18:56,300
-...his meemaw's alive and be the ball.
-Yeah. I got it.

304
00:18:56,468 --> 00:18:59,011
-Oh, we really need a strike here.
-I know.

305
00:18:59,221 --> 00:19:02,265
-Take your time and concentrate.
-Leonard, stop pressuring me.

306
00:19:02,432 --> 00:19:04,725
-I'm not pressuring you.
-You are. Just back off.

307
00:19:05,686 --> 00:19:07,520
Okay. I'm sorry. I'll shut up.

308
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:11,274
I didn't mean shut up.

309
00:19:11,608 --> 00:19:12,775
Fine.

310
00:19:12,943 --> 00:19:15,236
Just tell me what to do and I'll do it.

311
00:19:16,488 --> 00:19:17,530
[SIGHS]

312
00:19:17,698 --> 00:19:20,741
No. This isn't fair to you, Leonard.
I'm sorry.

313
00:19:22,452 --> 00:19:24,871
Wait, where are you going?
Penny, come back.

314
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:26,247
I'll get you ice cream.

315
00:19:26,957 --> 00:19:29,959
-No, let her go.
-Are you insane?

316
00:19:30,127 --> 00:19:31,961
If she leaves, it's over.

317
00:19:32,546 --> 00:19:35,214
Pretty sure it's already over.

318
00:19:36,258 --> 00:19:37,842
WIL:
Tough luck, Sheldon.

319
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:41,888
You did this, didn't you?

320
00:19:42,097 --> 00:19:45,391
Do you think I would break up a couple
just to win a bowling match?

321
00:19:46,476 --> 00:19:49,729
-No, I suppose not.
-Good. Keep thinking that.

322
00:19:53,650 --> 00:19:56,944
Wheaton....

323
00:20:00,324 --> 00:20:01,991
Mm-hm. Mm-hm. Yep.

324
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:06,621
I'm telling you, the Match.com chicks
are much looser than on eHarmony.

325
00:20:08,624 --> 00:20:14,045
Oh. You know, I gotta call you back.
I won a bet and it's time to collect.

326
00:20:27,976 --> 00:20:31,812
I don't know about you,
but I feel empowered.
