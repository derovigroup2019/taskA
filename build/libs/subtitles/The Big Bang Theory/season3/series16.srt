Totally."

164

your Juicy pants again.

Sheldon Cooper.

167
00:10:28,878 --> 00:10:30,378
Good morning, Your Honor.

168
00:10:30,546 --> 00:10:35,884
Dr. Sheldon Cooper appearing in pro se.
That is to say, representing himself.

169
00:10:36,052 --> 00:10:38,678
I know what it means.
I went to law school.

170
00:10:39,847 --> 00:10:42,349
And yet you wound up in traffic court.

171
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:47,145
If it would please the court,
I'd like to begin with an opening statement.

172
00:10:47,313 --> 00:10:49,314
The court would advise you
to make it quick.

173
00:10:49,482 --> 00:10:53,985
The court had a dicey-looking
breakfast burrito and just took an Imodium.

174
00:10:55,237 --> 00:10:58,698
Very well. A quick opening statement.

175
00:10:58,866 --> 00:11:03,036
Like a milking stool,
my case rests on three legs.

176
00:11:03,204 --> 00:11:06,623
I will demonstrate that
I was improperly instructed in driving...

177
00:11:06,832 --> 00:11:10,543
...by a woman whose lack of respect
for society borders on the sociopathic.

178
00:11:11,754 --> 00:11:14,631
I will argue that the emergency
met the legal doctrine...

179
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:19,219
...of quod est necessarium est licitum,
that which is necessary is legal.

180
00:11:19,387 --> 00:11:22,555
But first,
I will raise a Sixth Amendment issue.

181
00:11:22,723 --> 00:11:27,977
I am unable to confront my accuser,
a non-human entity, to wit, a camera.

182
00:11:28,145 --> 00:11:30,438
So to sum up, improper instruction...

183
00:11:30,606 --> 00:11:33,274
...quod est necessarium est licitum,
Sixth Amendment.

00:11:35,903 --> 00:11:37,612
-Impressive.
-Thank you.

186
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:40,782
Guilty. Pay the cashier.

187
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:43,743
I object.
You're completely ignoring the law.

188
00:11:43,911 --> 00:11:47,247
No, I'm following the law.
I'm ignoring you.

189
00:11:47,623 --> 00:11:51,501
Really? I would point out that I am
at the top of my profession...

190
00:11:51,669 --> 00:11:54,754
...while you preside
over the kiddie table of yours.

191
00:11:56,132 --> 00:11:59,467
Dr. Cooper, before I find you in contempt
and throw you in jail...

192
00:11:59,635 --> 00:12:02,971
...I'm gonna give you a chance
to apologize for that last remark.

193
00:12:03,431 --> 00:12:06,891
I'm a scientist.
I never apologize for the truth.

194
00:12:14,108 --> 00:12:15,984
That's my spot.

195
00:12:23,492 --> 00:12:26,995
I can't wait to ask Stan Lee
why he insists on giving his characters...

196
00:12:27,163 --> 00:12:30,165
...first and last names
that start with the same letter.

197
00:12:30,332 --> 00:12:32,500
Oh, come on. Why would you do that?

198
00:12:32,668 --> 00:12:36,254
Bruce Banner, Reed Richards,
Sue Storm, Stephen Strange...

199
00:12:36,422 --> 00:12:38,882
...Otto Octavius, Silver Surfer,
Peter Parker.

201
00:12:45,639 --> 00:12:46,681
Okay, I'm cutting.

202
00:12:46,849 --> 00:12:50,477
I'm not gonna talk to Stan Lee
after you cheese him off.

207
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:07,535
For doing the same crap he always does,

-He has to stay there until he apologizes.
-So tell him to apologize.

Oh, gee, thanks, Leonard.
That didn't occur to me.

Okay, that's enough, Howard.
