1
00:00:03,147 --> 00:00:05,893
So, I got the craziest
e-mail this morning.

2
00:00:05,894 --> 00:00:07,593
I don't mean to burst
your bubble, dude,

3
00:00:07,595 --> 00:00:10,947
but those penile enlargement
pills do not work.

4
00:00:10,949 --> 00:00:14,400
Believe me, I know.

5
00:00:15,319 --> 00:00:16,385
The e-mail I got was

6
00:00:16,387 --> 00:00:18,321
from the office of
Stephen Hawking.

7
00:00:18,323 --> 00:00:19,889
- You're kidding.
- Why?

8
00:00:19,891 --> 00:00:22,241
He's coming to the university
for a couple weeks to lecture,

9
00:00:22,243 --> 00:00:24,527
and he's looking for an
engineer to help maintain

10
00:00:24,529 --> 00:00:26,462
the equipment on his wheelchair.

11
00:00:26,464 --> 00:00:27,497
That's amazing.

12
00:00:27,499 --> 00:00:30,082
You'll be like his pit crew.

13
00:00:31,335 --> 00:00:33,953
A word of caution:
I would not do

14
00:00:33,955 --> 00:00:36,122
your Stephen Hawking
impression in front of him.

15
00:00:37,591 --> 00:00:39,592
(in Stephen Hawking's voice):
You're right.

16
00:00:40,744 --> 00:00:45,414
I suppose that could be
considered offensive.

17
00:00:45,416 --> 00:00:48,467
Boy, Sheldon's going
to freak out.

18
00:00:48,469 --> 00:00:50,419
Yeah, he worships Hawking.

19
00:00:50,421 --> 00:00:52,054
I was actually thinking
about bringing him along

20
00:00:52,056 --> 00:00:54,624
when I go over there so
he can meet the great man.

21
00:00:54,626 --> 00:00:55,808
That's really nice
of you, Howard.

22
00:00:55,810 --> 00:00:57,393
It's no big deal.

23
00:00:57,395 --> 00:00:59,979
Boy, a restraining order
from Stephen Hawking.

24
00:00:59,981 --> 00:01:03,599
It'll look so nice next to
the ones he's already got

25
00:01:03,601 --> 00:01:06,619
from Leonard Nimoy,
Carl Sagan and Stan Lee.

26
00:01:07,621 --> 00:01:09,488
Leonard, do you recall

27
00:01:09,490 --> 00:01:11,073
when I said that I was going

28
00:01:11,075 --> 00:01:13,042
to revolutionize
humanity's understanding

29
00:01:13,044 --> 00:01:15,328
of the Higgs boson particle,
and you said,

30
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:17,997
"Sheldon, it's 2:00 a.m.,
get out of my bedroom"?

31
00:01:17,999 --> 00:01:19,949
Like it was ten hours ago.

32
00:01:19,951 --> 00:01:21,634
What about it?

33
00:01:21,636 --> 00:01:23,002
Well, I believe I've done it.

34
00:01:23,004 --> 00:01:24,787
And I'm only saying "believe"
to sound modest,

35
00:01:24,789 --> 00:01:27,306
because, sweet Sam Houston,
I did it.

36
00:01:27,308 --> 00:01:29,508
Really?
That's incredible. Oh, here.

37
00:01:29,510 --> 00:01:30,476
Break out the math.

38
00:01:30,478 --> 00:01:32,061
Oh, okay, let me see this.

39
00:01:32,063 --> 00:01:34,597
All right, so
this particle here

40
00:01:34,599 --> 00:01:37,350
is the boson moving
forward in time.

41
00:01:37,352 --> 00:01:39,518
Now, I was thinking...
Howard, you go ahead and eat.

42
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:41,354
This isn't going to make
any sense to you.

43
00:01:43,507 --> 00:01:46,909
Sheldon, I have a working
understanding of physics.

44
00:01:46,911 --> 00:01:50,145
Yeah, good for you,
and don't stop working on it.

45
00:01:50,147 --> 00:01:52,582
Are you still
going to tell him

46
00:01:52,584 --> 00:01:54,667
about you-know-who?
Yep.

47
00:01:54,669 --> 00:01:55,952
Are you still going
to introduce him?

48
00:01:55,954 --> 00:01:57,587
Not on your life.

49
00:01:58,655 --> 00:02:02,208
? Our whole universe was
in a hot, dense state ?

50
00:02:02,210 --> 00:02:05,544
? Then nearly 14 billion years
ago expansion started... Wait! ?

51
00:02:05,546 --> 00:02:07,179
? The Earth began to cool ?

52
00:02:07,181 --> 00:02:09,715
? The autotrophs began to drool,
Neanderthals developed tools ?

53
00:02:09,717 --> 00:02:12,385
? We built the Wall ?
? <i>We built the pyramids</i> ?

54
00:02:12,387 --> 00:02:15,054
? Math, Science, History,
unraveling the mystery ?

55
00:02:15,056 --> 00:02:16,973
? That all started
with a big bang ?

56
00:02:16,975 --> 00:02:18,941
? <i>Bang!</i> ?

00:02:28,017 --> 00:02:30,435
Please, please, please

60
00:02:30,437 --> 00:02:32,304
let me meet Hawking.

61
00:02:32,306 --> 00:02:33,472
I told you, no.

62
00:02:33,474 --> 00:02:35,307
But I said I'm sorry.

63
00:02:35,309 --> 00:02:38,227
No, you said, "Would it help
if I said I'm sorry?"

64
00:02:38,229 --> 00:02:41,196
And you never answered me.

65
00:02:41,198 --> 00:02:43,515
So who owes whom an apology now?

66
00:02:43,517 --> 00:02:46,151
Sheldon,
you're a condescending jerk.

67
00:02:46,153 --> 00:02:48,704
Why on earth would I want
to do something nice for you?

68
00:02:48,706 --> 00:02:49,905
Um...

69
00:02:49,907 --> 00:02:51,990
to go to Jewish heaven?

70
00:02:51,992 --> 00:02:55,377
Jews don't have heaven.

71
00:02:55,379 --> 00:02:57,429
Then to avoid Jewish hell?

72
00:02:57,431 --> 00:02:58,547
Have you met my mother?

73
00:02:58,549 --> 00:02:59,798
I live in Jewish hell.

74
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:02,217
Howard, please.

75
00:03:02,219 --> 00:03:03,852
This is Stephen Hawking.

76
00:03:03,854 --> 00:03:06,171
Perhaps my only
intellectual equal.

77
00:03:06,173 --> 00:03:08,957
(chuckling)
Oh, you can't be serious.

78
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:11,510
Try to put yourself
in my place.

79
00:03:11,512 --> 00:03:14,045
Imagine you're the
sole human being

80
00:03:14,047 --> 00:03:16,982
living on a planet populated
with nothing but dogs.

81
00:03:16,984 --> 00:03:18,901
And then it turns out

82
00:03:18,903 --> 00:03:21,820
there's another human being.

83
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:24,990
Hang on.

84
00:03:24,992 --> 00:03:28,193
Are you saying
the rest of us are dogs?

85
00:03:28,195 --> 00:03:30,779
Okay, I can see you're going
to take this the wrong way.

86
00:03:30,781 --> 00:03:32,030
Let me try again.

87
00:03:32,032 --> 00:03:33,282
Imagine you're the
sole human being

88
00:03:33,284 --> 00:03:38,070
living on a planet populated
with nothing but chimps.

89
00:03:38,072 --> 00:03:39,905
Get out of my lab.

90
00:03:39,907 --> 00:03:41,506
Oh, now they're so much smarter
than dogs.

91
00:03:41,508 --> 00:03:43,275
Have you seen them
on those little bicycles?

92
00:03:43,277 --> 00:03:45,460
Get out.

93
00:03:46,579 --> 00:03:48,180
How about dolphins?

94
00:03:48,182 --> 00:03:48,931
Out!

95
00:03:51,768 --> 00:03:54,303
So, come on, how was
the first day with Hawking?

96
00:03:54,305 --> 00:03:55,470
It was great.

97
00:03:55,472 --> 00:03:56,939
We talked about movies...

98
00:03:56,941 --> 00:03:58,857
(groans): Oh...

99
00:03:58,859 --> 00:04:00,309
I showed him some card tricks...

100
00:04:00,311 --> 00:04:02,060
Oh!

101
00:04:02,062 --> 00:04:04,529
He even let me read a couple
pages from his new book.

102
00:04:04,531 --> 00:04:07,266
(groans): Oh!

103
00:04:07,268 --> 00:04:10,935
Something got
you down there, bunky?

104
00:04:10,937 --> 00:04:14,122
Howard, please,
I'm begging you.

105
00:04:14,124 --> 00:04:15,824
Raj,
you're our group historian.

106
00:04:15,826 --> 00:04:17,492
Has Sheldon ever begged before?

107
00:04:17,494 --> 00:04:18,877
Three times.

108
00:04:18,879 --> 00:04:22,331
He begged the Fox network
not to cancel <i>Firefly.</i>

109
00:04:22,333 --> 00:04:23,632
He begged

110
00:04:23,634 --> 00:04:27,035
the TNT network
to cancel <i>Babylon 5.</i>

111
00:04:28,454 --> 00:04:31,223
And when he got food poisoning
at the Rose Bowl Parade,

112
00:04:31,225 --> 00:04:33,091
he begged a deity
he doesn't believe in

113
00:04:33,093 --> 00:04:34,793
to end his life quickly.

114
00:04:36,312 --> 00:04:39,431
Do you understand how
important Hawking is to me?

115
00:04:39,433 --> 00:04:41,266
When I was six years old,

116
00:04:41,268 --> 00:04:44,486
I dressed up as
him for Halloween.

117
00:04:45,705 --> 00:04:47,105
You're kidding.

118
00:04:47,107 --> 00:04:49,808
No, sir, no, I took
my dad's desk chair,

119
00:04:49,810 --> 00:04:51,360
attached a Speak
& Spell to it

120
00:04:51,362 --> 00:04:53,779
and made my sister push
me up and down the block

121
00:04:53,781 --> 00:04:55,297
to trick or treat.

122
00:04:56,833 --> 00:04:58,583
Granted most people
thought I was R2-D2,

123
00:04:58,585 --> 00:05:01,370
but still, I got a lot of candy.

124
00:05:01,372 --> 00:05:03,255
You don't seem
to be understanding

125
00:05:03,257 --> 00:05:04,790
the English word "no."

126
00:05:04,792 --> 00:05:07,009
Maybe a different language
will help.

127
00:05:07,011 --> 00:05:08,210
Russian: <i>nyet.</i>

128
00:05:08,212 --> 00:05:10,462
Chinese: <i>bu.</i>

129
00:05:10,464 --> 00:05:11,847
Japanese: <i>iie.</i>

130
00:05:11,849 --> 00:05:14,332
Klingon: <i>qo'.</i>

131
00:05:14,334 --> 00:05:19,304
Binary coded Ascii:
0110111001101111.

132
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:23,075
It's actually 01100111.

133
00:05:23,077 --> 00:05:23,942
No!

134
00:05:23,944 --> 00:05:27,195
I'm not asking for me,

135
00:05:27,197 --> 00:05:30,799
I'm asking for Hawking.

136
00:05:30,801 --> 00:05:35,320
Let me try gansta:
Hells naw.

137
00:05:38,691 --> 00:05:40,358
Okay, look, how about this?

138
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:43,027
Just give him my paper
on the Higgs boson.

139
00:05:43,029 --> 00:05:44,329
If he sees the
incredible breakthrough

140
00:05:44,331 --> 00:05:46,248
I've made, he'll
reach out to me.

141
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:47,215
What if he doesn't?

142
00:05:47,217 --> 00:05:49,184
He will; he's really smart.

143
00:05:51,571 --> 00:05:52,971
That's an interesting idea.

144
00:05:52,973 --> 00:05:54,222
Why don't you give me

145
00:05:54,224 --> 00:05:56,641
a minute to talk it over
with my friends?

146
00:05:56,643 --> 00:05:58,009
- How do I do that?
- You walk away.

147
00:05:58,011 --> 00:06:00,211
Walking away.

148
00:06:08,488 --> 00:06:11,606
You do realize
you own his ass right now.

149
00:06:11,608 --> 00:06:13,725
I do.

150
00:06:13,727 --> 00:06:15,744
You can make him
do anything you want.

151
00:06:15,746 --> 00:06:17,696
Yeah, I know, I'm just trying
to figure out

152
00:06:17,698 --> 00:06:19,664
how much I want to punish him.

153
00:06:19,666 --> 00:06:20,949
Well, don't be too mean.

154
00:06:20,951 --> 00:06:22,167
SHELDON:
Hey, fellas,

155
00:06:22,169 --> 00:06:23,401
I'm thinking about making some

156
00:06:23,403 --> 00:06:25,704
freshly brewed iced tea
if anyone would like some.

157
00:06:25,706 --> 00:06:26,872
I wouldn't mind a glass.

158
00:06:26,874 --> 00:06:28,223
I wasn't talking to you.

159
00:06:30,093 --> 00:06:33,195
Bring him to his bony knees.

160
00:06:36,716 --> 00:06:38,266
Sheldon, come on back.

161
00:06:38,268 --> 00:06:41,470
Yes, yes.

162
00:06:44,474 --> 00:06:46,057
What did you decide?

163
00:06:46,059 --> 00:06:48,927
I'll give your paper
to Professor Hawking.

164
00:06:48,929 --> 00:06:50,395
Great, thank you!

165
00:06:50,397 --> 00:06:52,230
Oh, that's terrific!

166
00:06:52,232 --> 00:06:56,485
But in exchange, I'd like you
to do a few things for me.

167
00:06:56,487 --> 00:06:58,320
What kinds of things?

168
00:06:58,322 --> 00:07:03,241
Are you familiar
with the 12 labors of Hercules?

169
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:06,378
Of course.

170
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:08,947
You should be so lucky.

171
00:07:11,501 --> 00:07:13,335
All right.

172
00:07:13,337 --> 00:07:14,970
What would you like me
to do first?

173
00:07:14,972 --> 00:07:16,955
Well, I thought
I'd start you off

174
00:07:16,957 --> 00:07:19,007
by polishing my belt buckles.

175
00:07:19,009 --> 00:07:20,124
Oh.

176
00:07:20,126 --> 00:07:21,560
By all means.

177
00:07:21,562 --> 00:07:24,629
When I was a boy, I would
polish my Mee-Maw's silver.

178
00:07:24,631 --> 00:07:26,798
And she would entertain me
with stories

179
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,350
about growing up in Oklahoma.

180
00:07:28,352 --> 00:07:29,601
Interesting woman.

181
00:07:29,603 --> 00:07:34,072
She once killed a prairie dog
with a gravy boat.

182
00:07:34,074 --> 00:07:36,992
That's nice.

183
00:07:42,982 --> 00:07:45,217
(exhales)

184
00:07:46,569 --> 00:07:49,070
That's a lot of belt buckles.

185
00:07:49,072 --> 00:07:52,841
Funny thing is,
I only have one belt.

186
00:07:53,876 --> 00:07:55,927
Anyway, I'll let
you get started.

187
00:07:55,929 --> 00:07:57,295
Oh, by the way,

188
00:07:57,297 --> 00:07:59,998
the little marks, uh,
that look like water spots--

189
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,285
I tend to stand too close
to the urinal, so...

190
00:08:04,854 --> 00:08:08,190
...what you're seeing there
is splash back.

191
00:08:10,510 --> 00:08:12,844
You make sissy
on your belt buckles?

192
00:08:15,765 --> 00:08:18,683
Mee-Maw's forks never had that.

193
00:08:18,685 --> 00:08:21,786
Here is a black light
to check them.

194
00:08:21,788 --> 00:08:23,321
And for your own peace of mind,

195
00:08:23,323 --> 00:08:26,208
you might not want to shine that
around the rest of the room.

196
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:34,074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

197
00:08:35,701 --> 00:08:38,053
Sheldon, these look great.

198
00:08:38,055 --> 00:08:40,555
They're like
magnificent little crowns

199
00:08:40,557 --> 00:08:44,009
to hang over
my magnificent little jewels.

200
00:08:46,095 --> 00:08:47,395
How'd you get them so shiny?

201
00:08:47,397 --> 00:08:49,931
Oh, I-I buffed them
with Turtle Wax.

202
00:08:49,933 --> 00:08:52,383
The man down at Pep Boys
says from now on,

203
00:08:52,385 --> 00:08:55,403
the urine should just bead up
and roll right off.

204
00:08:55,405 --> 00:08:57,388
Way to go the extra mile.

205
00:08:57,390 --> 00:08:59,074
Your Mee-Maw would be proud.

206
00:08:59,076 --> 00:09:01,526
My Mee-Maw
must never know of this.

207
00:09:01,528 --> 00:09:04,746
Now will you give
Professor Hawking my paper?

208
00:09:04,748 --> 00:09:06,064
Oh, my dear boy, no.

209
00:09:06,066 --> 00:09:07,165
Okay.

210
00:09:07,167 --> 00:09:09,000
Next,

211
00:09:09,002 --> 00:09:12,754
this is
a sexy French maid costume

212
00:09:12,756 --> 00:09:14,089
I bought for Bernadette.

213
00:09:14,091 --> 00:09:15,707
I thought it might
spice things up

214
00:09:15,709 --> 00:09:18,009
and get her to dust
my room at the same time,

215
00:09:18,011 --> 00:09:21,913
but I was wrong
and really wrong.

216
00:09:21,915 --> 00:09:24,049
And you want me to
return it for you?

217
00:09:24,051 --> 00:09:27,519
<i>No, no, no, mon petit cherie.</i>

218
00:09:41,651 --> 00:09:43,535
What are you all staring at?

219
00:09:43,537 --> 00:09:45,904
You ever seen a man try
to get a meeting

220
00:09:45,906 --> 00:09:47,772
with Stephen Hawking before?

221
00:09:49,292 --> 00:09:51,159
(laughter)

222
00:10:01,926 --> 00:10:03,063
Hey.

223
00:10:03,064 --> 00:10:04,680
Hello.

224
00:10:04,682 --> 00:10:05,615
It's not Saturday night.

225
00:10:05,617 --> 00:10:07,516
Why are you doing
your laundry?

226
00:10:07,518 --> 00:10:11,070
This is not
my laundry.

227
00:10:11,072 --> 00:10:12,054
Wow, are these Amy's?

228
00:10:12,056 --> 00:10:15,625
Kind of trashy-- good for her.

229
00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:17,493
Those are Howard's.

230
00:10:17,495 --> 00:10:19,579
Ugh...

231
00:10:20,547 --> 00:10:22,165
Why are you washing

232
00:10:22,167 --> 00:10:25,501
Howard's man panties?

233
00:10:25,503 --> 00:10:26,752
Because if I don't,

234
00:10:26,754 --> 00:10:29,639
he won't give my paper
to Stephen Hawking.

235
00:10:29,641 --> 00:10:31,340
- He's a famous physicist.
- Yeah, yeah,

236
00:10:31,342 --> 00:10:35,761
I know, he's the wheelchair dude
who invented time.

237
00:10:37,681 --> 00:10:40,016
That's close enough.

238
00:10:40,018 --> 00:10:41,400
I don't understand,
why doesn't Howard

239
00:10:41,402 --> 00:10:43,052
just introduce you to the guy?

240
00:10:43,054 --> 00:10:47,290
Because he's punishing me for
being a "condescending jerk."

241
00:10:47,292 --> 00:10:49,892
You don't think
I'm condescending, do you?

242
00:10:49,894 --> 00:10:51,694
Well, kind of...

243
00:10:51,696 --> 00:10:54,163
Oh, I'm sorry,
condescending means...

244
00:10:54,165 --> 00:10:55,414
I know what it means.

245
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,783
And yes,
you love correcting people

246
00:10:57,785 --> 00:10:58,951
and putting them down.

247
00:10:58,953 --> 00:11:00,369
<i>Au contraire.</i>

248
00:11:00,371 --> 00:11:03,506
When I correct people
I am raising them up.

249
00:11:05,459 --> 00:11:08,211
You should know, I do it
for you more than anyone.

250
00:11:10,130 --> 00:11:12,381
Come on, you do it
to feel superior.

251
00:11:12,383 --> 00:11:13,549
I see that twinkle in your eye

252
00:11:13,551 --> 00:11:15,885
when someone says "who"
instead of "whom"

253
00:11:15,887 --> 00:11:18,938
or thinks the moon is a planet.

254
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:22,959
Or <i>Don Quixote</i> is a book
about a donkey named Hotay.

255
00:11:22,961 --> 00:11:24,994
See,

256
00:11:24,996 --> 00:11:26,229
there it is,
there's that twinkle.

257
00:11:26,231 --> 00:11:27,396
Well, I can't help it.

258
00:11:27,398 --> 00:11:29,649
That's an involuntary twinkle.

259
00:11:30,534 --> 00:11:32,735
What do you want me
to tell you, Sheldon?

260
00:11:32,737 --> 00:11:34,153
I want you to tell me

261
00:11:34,155 --> 00:11:36,622
that Howard is being mean to me
for no reason.

262
00:11:36,624 --> 00:11:39,992
Fine, Howard is being mean
to you for no reason.

263
00:11:39,994 --> 00:11:41,827
I knew it.

264
00:11:44,831 --> 00:11:46,465
(groans)

265
00:11:46,467 --> 00:11:47,700
What's the matter?

266
00:11:47,702 --> 00:11:49,285
Every time I spend the night,

267
00:11:49,287 --> 00:11:53,539
your mom slaps me on the behind
and says, "Go get 'em."

268
00:11:53,541 --> 00:11:55,675
It's not her fault.

269
00:11:55,677 --> 00:11:58,761
She's getting
hormone replacement therapy.

270
00:12:01,064 --> 00:12:04,100
Makes her crazy horny.

271
00:12:04,818 --> 00:12:06,352
Check this out,
I got Sheldon

272
00:12:06,354 --> 00:12:08,738
to wear the French
maid's costume.

273
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:10,606
Oh, my God,
that's terrible.

274
00:12:10,608 --> 00:12:13,726
Hey, I gave you
first crack at it.

275
00:12:13,728 --> 00:12:15,444
Why are you doing that?

276
00:12:15,446 --> 00:12:16,896
You're being mean to him.

277
00:12:16,898 --> 00:12:18,314
He's mean to me all the time.

278
00:12:18,316 --> 00:12:20,700
You've heard him tease me
about not having a doctorate.

279
00:12:20,702 --> 00:12:22,501
If you don't want
to get teased about that,

280
00:12:22,503 --> 00:12:23,669
get a doctorate.

281
00:12:26,656 --> 00:12:28,925
I have one; they're great.

282
00:12:29,843 --> 00:12:32,728
Oh, come on, the
man torments me.

283
00:12:32,730 --> 00:12:33,662
I'm just letting him have

284
00:12:33,664 --> 00:12:35,648
a little taste
of his own medicine.

285
00:12:35,650 --> 00:12:37,166
It's not the same thing.

286
00:12:37,168 --> 00:12:38,718
Sheldon doesn't know
when he's being mean

287
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:40,553
because the part of his brain
that should know

288
00:12:40,555 --> 00:12:43,472
is getting a wedgie
from the rest of his brain.

289
00:12:46,193 --> 00:12:48,361
Fine, I'll just make him do
a couple more things,

290
00:12:48,363 --> 00:12:49,312
then I'll stop.

291
00:12:49,314 --> 00:12:51,180
No, you have to stop now.

292
00:12:51,182 --> 00:12:54,216
MRS. WOLOWITZ:
Bernadette, I want to remind you,

293
00:12:54,218 --> 00:12:58,487
you promised to take me
dress shopping tomorrow!

294
00:12:58,489 --> 00:13:01,874
Oh, damn.

295
00:13:01,876 --> 00:13:05,294
I'm sorry,
I can't make it,

296
00:13:05,296 --> 00:13:09,165
but Sheldon's going
to go with you!

297
00:13:14,921 --> 00:13:18,090
And that's the last thing
you do to him.

298
00:13:21,345 --> 00:13:25,514
MRS. WOLOWITZ:
Sheldon!

299
00:13:25,516 --> 00:13:28,784
I need your help!

300
00:13:28,786 --> 00:13:31,454
What is it now, Mrs. Wolowitz?

301
00:13:31,456 --> 00:13:32,822
It's this dress!

302
00:13:32,824 --> 00:13:37,476
When I put my front in,
my back pops out!

303
00:13:39,579 --> 00:13:44,583
When I put my back in,
my front pops out!

304
00:13:44,585 --> 00:13:48,371
It's like trying to keep
two dogs in a bathtub!

305
00:13:50,207 --> 00:13:52,291
What do you want me to do?

306
00:13:52,293 --> 00:13:54,794
We're gonna have
to work as a team!

307
00:13:54,796 --> 00:13:59,365
Get in here, grab a handful,
and start stuffing!

308
00:14:05,756 --> 00:14:08,708
SHELDON:
I'm not sure how to do this.

309
00:14:08,710 --> 00:14:13,429
It's easy, just pretend you're
putting away a sleeping bag.

310
00:14:14,948 --> 00:14:19,768
Sleeping bags don't usually
sweat this much, but okay.

311
00:14:19,770 --> 00:14:21,704
Now zip me up.

312
00:14:21,706 --> 00:14:23,456
Oh, if we squeeze
you any tighter,

313
00:14:23,458 --> 00:14:25,991
you may turn
into a diamond.

314
00:14:28,261 --> 00:14:31,881
You're right,
who am I kidding?

315
00:14:31,883 --> 00:14:34,950
You should have seen me
when I was young, Sheldon.

316
00:14:34,952 --> 00:14:39,839
The fellas used to line up
and bring me boxes of candy.

317
00:14:40,724 --> 00:14:43,109
Why did I eat it all?!

318
00:14:46,396 --> 00:14:47,980
Would you hold me?

319
00:14:47,982 --> 00:14:51,350
Oh... no, you know, I'm not
really the holding kind of...

320
00:14:51,352 --> 00:14:53,936
Oh!

321
00:14:56,189 --> 00:14:58,157
Oh, guys, I just remembered.

322
00:14:58,159 --> 00:15:01,643
I got you
some Hawking souvenirs.

323
00:15:01,645 --> 00:15:02,811
What are these?

324
00:15:02,813 --> 00:15:04,980
Gears and springs
from his wheelchair.

325
00:15:04,982 --> 00:15:06,449
Pretty cool, huh?

326
00:15:07,317 --> 00:15:10,035
Wow, that's amazing.

327
00:15:10,037 --> 00:15:12,204
I made an adjustment
on the motor drive

328
00:15:12,206 --> 00:15:14,423
and when I was putting it
back together

329
00:15:14,425 --> 00:15:17,927
I could not for the life of me
figure out where they went.

330
00:15:19,996 --> 00:15:22,264
(sighs)
I did it.

331
00:15:22,266 --> 00:15:24,600
Had to go
to three clothing stores,

332
00:15:24,602 --> 00:15:29,472
but we finally found a dress
that could envelop your mother.

333
00:15:30,557 --> 00:15:31,673
I should have sent you

334
00:15:31,675 --> 00:15:34,059
to the custom car cover place
in Altadena.

335
00:15:34,061 --> 00:15:35,978
They have her pattern on file.

336
00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:37,279
(laughs)

337
00:15:37,281 --> 00:15:38,481
Humorous.

338
00:15:39,116 --> 00:15:41,350
Now will you
please present

339
00:15:41,352 --> 00:15:43,569
my paper
to Professor Hawking?

340
00:15:43,571 --> 00:15:44,653
I don't know.

341
00:15:44,655 --> 00:15:45,955
Oh, for heaven's sake.

342
00:15:45,957 --> 00:15:49,291
I did your laundry, I pee-pee-
proofed your belt buckles,

343
00:15:49,293 --> 00:15:50,409
I, I even sprained

344
00:15:50,411 --> 00:15:54,046
my wrist helping
your mother lift her bosom.

345
00:15:57,434 --> 00:15:59,552
All right, Sheldon,

346
00:15:59,554 --> 00:16:02,505
there's only one thing left
I want you to do.

347
00:16:02,507 --> 00:16:04,140
Don't worry, it's an easy one.

348
00:16:04,142 --> 00:16:05,458
Okay.

349
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:07,309
Give me a compliment.

350
00:16:07,311 --> 00:16:09,595
Fine.

351
00:16:09,597 --> 00:16:11,397
You have very tiny hands.

352
00:16:14,234 --> 00:16:16,986
No... about my job.

353
00:16:16,988 --> 00:16:20,639
I want you to tell me
I'm good at what I do.

354
00:16:20,641 --> 00:16:23,209
You're obviously good
at what you do.

355
00:16:23,211 --> 00:16:26,428
Well, then why are you
always ripping on me?

356
00:16:26,430 --> 00:16:28,581
Oh, I understand
the confusion.

357
00:16:28,583 --> 00:16:31,750
I have never said that you are
not good at what you do.

358
00:16:31,752 --> 00:16:36,121
It's just that what you do
is not worth doing.

359
00:16:40,844 --> 00:16:42,878
It's nicer than anything
he's ever said to me.

360
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:45,014
I'd take it and run.

361
00:16:46,349 --> 00:16:48,334
Thank you, Sheldon.

362
00:16:48,336 --> 00:16:50,236
Now will you give
my paper to Hawking?

363
00:16:50,238 --> 00:16:51,504
Sorry, I can't.

364
00:16:51,506 --> 00:16:52,705
What, why not?

365
00:16:52,707 --> 00:16:54,807
I gave it to him three days ago.

366
00:16:54,809 --> 00:16:57,309
He was really
impressed.

367
00:16:57,311 --> 00:16:58,744
He wants to meet you.

368
00:17:00,580 --> 00:17:02,748
All right, then.

369
00:17:03,550 --> 00:17:05,100
Thank you, Howard.

370
00:17:05,102 --> 00:17:07,736
Please let
Professor Hawking know

371
00:17:07,738 --> 00:17:11,440
that I'm available
at his earliest convenience.

372
00:17:11,442 --> 00:17:14,193
I thought he might be
a little more excited.

373
00:17:14,195 --> 00:17:15,194
Give it a second.

374
00:17:15,196 --> 00:17:17,546
(Sheldon whooping wildly)

375
00:17:27,752 --> 00:17:29,558
Professor Hawking,

376
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:32,912
it's an honor and a privilege
to meet you, sir.

377
00:17:32,914 --> 00:17:35,698
(beeping)

378
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:37,950
I know.

379
00:17:38,952 --> 00:17:42,571
I want to thank you for
taking time to see me.

380
00:17:42,573 --> 00:17:43,522
(beeps)

381
00:17:43,524 --> 00:17:44,607
My pleasure.

382
00:17:44,609 --> 00:17:48,294
I enjoyed reading
your paper very much.

383
00:17:48,296 --> 00:17:50,863
You clearly have
a brilliant mind.

384
00:17:50,865 --> 00:17:54,400
I know.
(beeping)

385
00:17:54,402 --> 00:17:58,537
Your thesis that the Higgs boson
is a black hole

386
00:17:58,539 --> 00:18:02,341
accelerating backwards
through time is fascinating.

387
00:18:02,343 --> 00:18:04,426
Thank you.

388
00:18:04,428 --> 00:18:08,280
It just-- it came to me
one morning in the shower.

389
00:18:08,282 --> 00:18:10,833
(beeps)

390
00:18:10,835 --> 00:18:12,134
That's nice.

391
00:18:12,136 --> 00:18:15,154
Too bad it's wrong.

392
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:20,442
What do you mean wrong?

393
00:18:20,444 --> 00:18:21,577
(beeps)

394
00:18:21,579 --> 00:18:24,930
You made an arithmetic mistake
on page two.

395
00:18:24,932 --> 00:18:27,216
(beeping)

396
00:18:27,218 --> 00:18:30,686
It was quite the boner.

397
00:18:32,472 --> 00:18:36,008
No, no... that
can't be right.

398
00:18:36,010 --> 00:18:38,878
I-I don't make
arithmetic mistakes.

399
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,913
Are you saying I do?

400
00:18:40,915 --> 00:18:41,881
Oh, no,

401
00:18:41,883 --> 00:18:43,315
no, no, of course not.

402
00:18:43,317 --> 00:18:44,600
It's just, I
was thinking...

403
00:18:44,602 --> 00:18:47,186
Oh, gosh, golly,
I made a boo-boo,

404
00:18:47,188 --> 00:18:50,272
and I gave it to
Stephen Hawking.

405
00:18:55,547 --> 00:18:57,882
Great, another fainter.
