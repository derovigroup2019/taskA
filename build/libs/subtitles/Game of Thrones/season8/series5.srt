1
00:00:03,411 --> 00:00:05,161
We have won the Great War.

2
00:00:06,286 --> 00:00:07,744
Now we will win the last war.

3
00:00:08,120 --> 00:00:10,303
The objective
here is to remove Cersei

4
00:00:10,327 --> 00:00:12,202
without destroying
King's Landing.

5
00:00:14,536 --> 00:00:16,176
You heading to King's Landing?

6
00:00:16,369 --> 00:00:18,202
There's some
unfinished business.

7
00:00:18,494 --> 00:00:19,494
Me too.

8
00:00:19,661 --> 00:00:21,494
I don't plan on coming back.

9
00:00:22,327 --> 00:00:23,661
Neither do I.

10
00:00:25,286 --> 00:00:28,536
I always wanted to be there
when they execute your sister.

11
00:00:29,494 --> 00:00:31,161
Seems like
I won't get the chance.

12
00:00:32,411 --> 00:00:34,091
Stay with me.

13
00:00:35,161 --> 00:00:36,327
Please.

14
00:00:36,744 --> 00:00:38,161
Cersei's hateful...

15
00:00:40,661 --> 00:00:41,703
And so am I.

16
00:00:50,578 --> 00:00:52,036
I need to tell you something.

17
00:00:54,536 --> 00:00:57,494
But you have to swear
you'll never tell another soul.

18
00:00:57,578 --> 00:01:00,661
What if there's someone else?
Someone better.

19
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:03,870
At a certain point, you choose
a person you believe in,

20
00:01:03,953 --> 00:01:05,286
and you fight for that person.

21
00:01:05,369 --> 00:01:07,578
Even if you know
it's a mistake?

22
00:01:10,369 --> 00:01:11,870
He has the better claim
to the throne.

23
00:01:11,953 --> 00:01:13,554
Every time
a Targaryen is born,

24
00:01:13,578 --> 00:01:14,578
the gods flip a coin.

25
00:01:14,995 --> 00:01:16,637
The Mad King
gave his enemies the justice

26
00:01:16,661 --> 00:01:17,703
he thought they deserved.

27
00:01:17,786 --> 00:01:19,306
Children are not their fathers.

28
00:01:19,578 --> 00:01:21,178
- Be a dragon.
- You have a gentle heart.

29
00:01:21,202 --> 00:01:23,619
A Targaryen
alone in the world

30
00:01:23,703 --> 00:01:24,911
is a terrible thing.

31
00:01:25,244 --> 00:01:27,303
You don't want to awake the dragon, do you?

32
00:03:56,536 --> 00:03:57,452
Come in.

33
00:04:01,452 --> 00:04:02,578
And?

34
00:04:04,369 --> 00:04:05,911
Nothing?

35
00:04:05,995 --> 00:04:07,619
She won't eat.

36
00:04:12,494 --> 00:04:14,703
We'll try again at supper.

37
00:04:16,953 --> 00:04:18,619
I think they're watching me.

38
00:04:19,619 --> 00:04:23,536
- Who?
- Her soldiers.

39
00:04:23,619 --> 00:04:27,578
Of course they are.
That's their job.

40
00:04:37,744 --> 00:04:39,536
What have I told you, Martha?

41
00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:44,078
The greater the risk,
the greater the reward.

42
00:04:45,411 --> 00:04:48,286
Go on. They'll be missing you
in the kitchen.

43
00:05:11,828 --> 00:05:13,452
The Northern armies?

44
00:05:13,536 --> 00:05:15,036
Just crossed the Trident.

45
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:17,995
They'll be at the walls
of King's Landing in two days.

46
00:05:19,161 --> 00:05:20,661
How is she?

47
00:05:20,744 --> 00:05:23,369
She hasn't seen anyone
since we returned.

48
00:05:23,452 --> 00:05:26,786
Hasn't left her chambers,
hasn't accepted any food.

49
00:05:27,953 --> 00:05:29,703
She shouldn't be alone.

50
00:05:29,786 --> 00:05:32,870
You're worried for her.
I admire your empathy.

51
00:05:32,953 --> 00:05:34,828
Aren't you worried for her?

52
00:05:34,911 --> 00:05:37,036
I'm worried for all of us.

53
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:39,286
They say every time
a Targaryen is born,

54
00:05:39,369 --> 00:05:42,578
the gods toss a coin
and the world holds its breath.

55
00:05:42,661 --> 00:05:45,411
We're not much for riddles
where I'm from.

56
00:05:45,494 --> 00:05:48,327
We both know
what she's about to do.

57
00:05:54,202 --> 00:05:56,327
That's her decision to make.
She is our queen.

58
00:05:56,411 --> 00:06:00,536
Men decide where power resides,
whether or not they know it.

59
00:06:03,078 --> 00:06:04,870
What do you want?

60
00:06:04,953 --> 00:06:06,703
All I've ever wanted.

61
00:06:06,786 --> 00:06:09,703
The right ruler
on the Iron Throne.

62
00:06:11,244 --> 00:06:14,078
I still don't know
how her coin has landed.

63
00:06:14,161 --> 00:06:17,494
But I'm quite certain
about yours.

64
00:06:25,536 --> 00:06:27,452
I don't want it.

65
00:06:27,536 --> 00:06:28,870
I never have.

66
00:06:31,327 --> 00:06:35,036
I have known more kings
and queens than any man living.

67
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,786
I've heard
what they say to crowds,

68
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:38,703
and seen what they do
in the shadows.

69
00:06:38,786 --> 00:06:42,161
I have furthered their designs,
however horrible.

70
00:06:42,244 --> 00:06:44,953
But what I tell you now
is true:

71
00:06:45,036 --> 00:06:48,244
You will rule wisely and well,
while she...

72
00:06:48,327 --> 00:06:50,120
She...

73
00:06:50,202 --> 00:06:51,286
is my queen.

74
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,578
Your Grace?

75
00:07:39,786 --> 00:07:42,244
There's something
you need to know.

76
00:07:43,536 --> 00:07:45,786
Someone has betrayed me.

77
00:07:51,953 --> 00:07:53,327
Yes.

78
00:07:57,286 --> 00:07:59,078
Jon Snow.

79
00:08:04,953 --> 00:08:05,953
Varys.

80
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:10,244
He knows the truth about Jon.

81
00:08:11,536 --> 00:08:13,078
He does.

82
00:08:17,828 --> 00:08:20,161
Because you told him.

83
00:08:22,452 --> 00:08:24,202
You learned from Sansa.

84
00:08:25,161 --> 00:08:26,828
And she learned from Jon,

85
00:08:26,911 --> 00:08:29,494
though I begged him
not to tell her.

86
00:08:30,870 --> 00:08:32,703
As I said...

87
00:08:33,452 --> 00:08:34,536
he betrayed me.

88
00:08:34,619 --> 00:08:36,452
I'm glad Sansa told me.

89
00:08:36,536 --> 00:08:38,078
I am your Hand.

90
00:08:38,161 --> 00:08:40,661
I need to be aware
of any threats you're facing.

91
00:08:42,161 --> 00:08:43,452
And Varys?

92
00:08:43,536 --> 00:08:46,661
Your Master of Whisperers
needs to be aware too.

93
00:08:47,494 --> 00:08:49,911
You spoke to him first.

94
00:08:49,995 --> 00:08:51,244
Without coming to me.

95
00:08:51,327 --> 00:08:53,786
Without asking my permission.

96
00:08:55,411 --> 00:08:58,036
It was a mistake.

97
00:09:00,036 --> 00:09:02,828
Why do you think
Sansa told you?

98
00:09:02,911 --> 00:09:04,619
What do you think
she hoped to gain?

99
00:09:04,703 --> 00:09:08,327
- She trusts me.
- Yes, she trusts you.

100
00:09:09,452 --> 00:09:13,536
She trusted you
to spread secrets

101
00:09:13,619 --> 00:09:16,703
that could destroy
your own queen.

102
00:09:18,703 --> 00:09:20,995
And you did not let her down.

103
00:09:24,661 --> 00:09:28,202
If I have failed you, my queen,
forgive me.

104
00:09:30,078 --> 00:09:32,369
Our intentions were good.

105
00:09:33,786 --> 00:09:37,369
We wanted what you want.
A better world, all of us.

106
00:09:38,619 --> 00:09:41,452
Varys as much as anyone.

107
00:09:50,161 --> 00:09:52,286
But it doesn't matter now.

108
00:09:54,452 --> 00:09:55,452
No.

109
00:09:56,744 --> 00:09:58,411
It doesn't matter now.

110
00:11:58,870 --> 00:12:00,828
It was me.

111
00:12:06,202 --> 00:12:07,828
I hope I deserve this.

112
00:12:07,911 --> 00:12:09,578
Truly, I do.

113
00:12:09,661 --> 00:12:11,744
I hope I'm wrong.

114
00:12:19,286 --> 00:12:20,369
Goodbye, old friend.

115
00:13:01,870 --> 00:13:02,953
Lord Varys.

116
00:13:04,703 --> 00:13:06,870
I, Daenerys of House Targaryen,

117
00:13:06,953 --> 00:13:08,786
First of My Name,

118
00:13:08,870 --> 00:13:12,120
Breaker of Chains
and Mother of Dragons...

119
00:13:13,953 --> 00:13:15,995
sentence you to die.

120
00:13:26,494 --> 00:13:27,619
Dracarys.

121
00:14:18,786 --> 00:14:20,369
This was all
she brought with her

122
00:14:20,452 --> 00:14:22,369
when we crossed the Narrow Sea.

123
00:14:23,452 --> 00:14:25,494
Her only possession.

124
00:15:41,202 --> 00:15:43,828
What did I say would
happen if you told your sister?

125
00:15:43,911 --> 00:15:47,202
I don't want it,
and that's what I told him.

126
00:15:48,494 --> 00:15:50,703
She betrayed your trust.

127
00:15:50,786 --> 00:15:52,536
She killed Varys
as much as I did.

128
00:15:54,161 --> 00:15:56,619
This was a victory for her.

129
00:15:58,120 --> 00:15:59,327
Now she knows what happens

130
00:15:59,411 --> 00:16:01,327
when people
hear the truth about you.

131
00:16:03,953 --> 00:16:07,953
Far more people in Westeros
love you than love me.

132
00:16:10,452 --> 00:16:12,828
I don't have love here.

133
00:16:14,286 --> 00:16:16,327
I only have fear.

134
00:16:19,244 --> 00:16:21,120
I love you.

135
00:16:23,661 --> 00:16:26,452
And you will always be my queen.

136
00:16:33,286 --> 00:16:35,286
Is that all I am to you?

137
00:16:37,036 --> 00:16:38,995
Your queen?

138
00:17:15,870 --> 00:17:17,828
All right, then.

139
00:17:25,202 --> 00:17:27,036
Let it be fear.

140
00:17:31,036 --> 00:17:34,286
The people who live there,
they're not your enemies.

141
00:17:34,369 --> 00:17:37,120
They're innocents, like the ones
you liberated in Meereen.

142
00:17:37,202 --> 00:17:39,178
In Meereen,
the slaves turned on the masters

143
00:17:39,202 --> 00:17:42,286
and liberated the city
themselves the moment I arrived.

144
00:17:42,369 --> 00:17:43,578
They're afraid.

145
00:17:43,661 --> 00:17:44,911
Anyone who resists Cersei

146
00:17:44,995 --> 00:17:47,120
will see his family butchered.

147
00:17:47,202 --> 00:17:49,411
You can't expect them
to be heroes.

148
00:17:49,494 --> 00:17:51,619
- They're hostages.
- They are.

149
00:17:51,703 --> 00:17:55,036
In a tyrant's grip.
Whose fault is that? Mine?

150
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:57,744
What does it matter
whose fault it is?

151
00:17:57,828 --> 00:18:00,703
Thousands of children will die
if the city burns.

152
00:18:00,786 --> 00:18:02,036
Your sister knows how to use

153
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:04,161
her enemies' weaknesses
against them.

154
00:18:04,244 --> 00:18:06,661
That's what she thinks
our mercy is:

155
00:18:06,744 --> 00:18:07,911
weakness.

156
00:18:07,995 --> 00:18:10,078
- I beg you, my queen...
- But she's wrong.

157
00:18:10,953 --> 00:18:12,744
Mercy is our strength.

158
00:18:13,995 --> 00:18:16,369
Our mercy
towards future generations

159
00:18:16,452 --> 00:18:19,036
who will never again
be held hostage by a tyrant.

160
00:18:24,995 --> 00:18:26,619
Ready the Unsullied.

161
00:18:26,703 --> 00:18:28,244
Tonight you sail
for King's Landing

162
00:18:28,327 --> 00:18:30,220
- to join the Northern armies.
- Cersei's followers

163
00:18:30,244 --> 00:18:32,120
will abandon her
if they know the war is lost.

164
00:18:32,202 --> 00:18:33,369
Give them that chance.

165
00:18:33,452 --> 00:18:35,744
If the city surrenders,

166
00:18:35,828 --> 00:18:37,870
they will ring the bells
and raise the gates.

167
00:18:37,953 --> 00:18:41,619
Please, if you hear them ringing
the bells, call off the attack.

168
00:18:49,786 --> 00:18:51,786
Wait for me outside the city.

169
00:18:52,870 --> 00:18:54,578
You'll know when it's time.

170
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:27,995
Your brother was stopped
trying to get past our lines.

171
00:19:32,327 --> 00:19:35,828
It seems he hasn't abandoned
your sister after all.

172
00:19:41,536 --> 00:19:43,161
The next time you fail me...

173
00:19:44,536 --> 00:19:46,995
will be the last time
you fail me.

174
00:20:03,786 --> 00:20:05,786
Let them pass.

175
00:20:17,202 --> 00:20:18,786
Through the gate.

176
00:20:18,870 --> 00:20:20,202
Get going.

177
00:21:01,786 --> 00:21:04,703
The rearguard should be here by daybreak.

178
00:21:04,786 --> 00:21:07,244
She wants to attack now.

179
00:21:08,452 --> 00:21:09,911
Daybreak at the earliest.

180
00:21:11,411 --> 00:21:14,578
- Careful with that.
- My lord.

181
00:21:17,036 --> 00:21:18,244
Davos.

182
00:21:20,828 --> 00:21:23,120
I need to ask you a favor.

183
00:21:25,244 --> 00:21:27,744
You're the greatest smuggler
alive, aren't you?

184
00:21:29,286 --> 00:21:32,661
I'm not gonna like this favor,
am I?

185
00:21:32,744 --> 00:21:35,202
He's always better
when he's got some food in him.

186
00:21:35,286 --> 00:21:38,452
Problem is when he's got drink in him.

187
00:21:38,536 --> 00:21:39,995
See what he did the other week?

188
00:21:40,078 --> 00:21:41,661
Aye. Fighting as well.

189
00:21:41,744 --> 00:21:43,120
Commander nearly caught him.

190
00:21:43,202 --> 00:21:46,078
Ay up. Where you going?

191
00:21:47,494 --> 00:21:49,494
I'm Arya Stark.

192
00:21:49,578 --> 00:21:52,120
I'm going to kill Queen Cersei.

193
00:21:56,619 --> 00:21:57,619
Think about it.

194
00:21:57,703 --> 00:22:00,327
She kills Cersei,
the war's over.

195
00:22:00,411 --> 00:22:03,786
There won't be a siege.
You might not even die tomorrow.

196
00:22:07,078 --> 00:22:08,911
I need to go talk to my captain.

197
00:22:08,995 --> 00:22:10,995
Go ahead, talk to him.

198
00:22:13,744 --> 00:22:15,452
Where's he going?

199
00:22:45,578 --> 00:22:47,161
We speak the common tongue.

200
00:22:48,161 --> 00:22:50,078
Ah. Good.

201
00:22:50,161 --> 00:22:51,911
I want to be alone
with the prisoner.

202
00:22:51,995 --> 00:22:54,161
Get some rest.
Tomorrow will be a long day.

203
00:22:54,244 --> 00:22:56,619
We have orders to guard the prisoner.

204
00:22:56,703 --> 00:22:58,494
Ordered by whom?
The queen herself?

205
00:22:59,703 --> 00:23:01,661
- No.
- Well, in that case,

206
00:23:01,744 --> 00:23:04,703
as Hand of the Queen, I outrank
whomever gave your order.

207
00:23:04,786 --> 00:23:06,327
Probably by quite a lot.

208
00:23:30,036 --> 00:23:32,036
How did they find you?

209
00:23:40,202 --> 00:23:42,619
Did you consider taking it off?

210
00:23:44,078 --> 00:23:47,536
Cersei once called me
"the stupidest Lannister."

211
00:23:49,036 --> 00:23:52,286
And you're going back to her,
to die with her.

212
00:23:53,452 --> 00:23:55,078
You've underestimated her
before.

213
00:23:55,161 --> 00:23:56,536
She's going to die.

214
00:23:57,703 --> 00:23:59,120
Unless you can convince her

215
00:23:59,202 --> 00:24:00,828
to change her course of action.

216
00:24:00,911 --> 00:24:02,911
Difficult to do from here.

217
00:24:08,536 --> 00:24:11,661
When have I ever been able
to convince Cersei of anything?

218
00:24:11,744 --> 00:24:13,327
Try.

219
00:24:13,411 --> 00:24:15,369
If not for yourself,
if not for her,

220
00:24:15,452 --> 00:24:18,202
then for every one of the
million people in that city,

221
00:24:18,286 --> 00:24:19,619
innocent or otherwise.

222
00:24:19,703 --> 00:24:22,703
To be honest, I never really
cared much for them.

223
00:24:22,786 --> 00:24:24,452
Innocent or otherwise.

224
00:24:25,786 --> 00:24:27,911
You do care for one innocent.

225
00:24:28,828 --> 00:24:30,327
I know you do.

226
00:24:30,411 --> 00:24:32,161
And so does Cersei.

227
00:24:33,452 --> 00:24:35,161
She has a reason now.

228
00:24:36,619 --> 00:24:40,369
The child is the reason
she'll never give an inch.

229
00:24:40,452 --> 00:24:42,244
All the worst things
she's ever done,

230
00:24:42,327 --> 00:24:44,703
she's done for her children.

231
00:24:44,786 --> 00:24:46,953
It's not impossible
that she'll win.

232
00:24:47,036 --> 00:24:48,244
She won't.

233
00:24:48,327 --> 00:24:50,202
Her enemy's forces
have been depleted,

234
00:24:50,286 --> 00:24:51,661
as she said they would be.

235
00:24:51,744 --> 00:24:53,995
Two of the three dragons
are dead.

236
00:24:54,078 --> 00:24:56,619
- She's evened the odds.
- The city will fall tomorrow.

237
00:24:56,703 --> 00:24:58,679
She has the Lannister army,
she has the Golden Company...

238
00:24:58,703 --> 00:25:00,470
I defended the city
last time it was attacked.

239
00:25:00,494 --> 00:25:03,078
I know it better than anyone.
It will fall tomorrow.

240
00:25:03,161 --> 00:25:05,411
Then I suppose I'll die
tomorrow, if not before.

241
00:25:05,494 --> 00:25:07,161
Why?

242
00:25:13,369 --> 00:25:14,870
Escape.

243
00:25:14,953 --> 00:25:16,953
The two of you, together.

244
00:25:17,036 --> 00:25:18,286
Remember where we met,

245
00:25:18,369 --> 00:25:20,036
where they keep
the dragon skulls,

246
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:21,161
beneath the Red Keep?

247
00:25:22,828 --> 00:25:24,120
Take her down there.

248
00:25:24,202 --> 00:25:25,870
Keep following
the stairways down,

249
00:25:25,953 --> 00:25:27,327
down as far as they'll go.

250
00:25:27,411 --> 00:25:29,744
You'll come out onto a beach
at the foot of the keep.

251
00:25:29,828 --> 00:25:31,786
A dinghy will be waiting
for you.

252
00:25:32,995 --> 00:25:34,369
Sail out of the bay.

253
00:25:34,452 --> 00:25:37,161
If the winds are kind,
you'll make it to Pentos.

254
00:25:38,327 --> 00:25:40,744
Start a new life.

255
00:25:44,078 --> 00:25:47,411
Sail right past the Iron Fleet
and into a new life?

256
00:25:47,494 --> 00:25:50,161
Sounds a lot less likely
than Cersei winning this war...

257
00:25:50,244 --> 00:25:52,870
There won't be an Iron Fleet
for much longer.

258
00:25:54,078 --> 00:25:55,327
Do it.

259
00:25:55,411 --> 00:25:58,536
If you don't,
you'll never see Cersei again.

260
00:26:04,411 --> 00:26:06,202
Swear to me.

261
00:26:09,494 --> 00:26:11,411
You have my word.

262
00:26:16,036 --> 00:26:17,452
If it works,

263
00:26:17,536 --> 00:26:19,202
give the order
to ring all the bells

264
00:26:19,286 --> 00:26:21,036
in King's Landing
and open the gates.

265
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:23,911
That will be our signal
that the city has surrendered.

266
00:26:23,995 --> 00:26:25,452
I'll try.

267
00:26:26,870 --> 00:26:29,244
I never thought
I'd get to repay the favor.

268
00:26:29,327 --> 00:26:32,036
Remember, ring the bells
and open the gates.

269
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:34,661
Your queen
will execute you for this.

270
00:26:34,744 --> 00:26:36,494
If Daenerys can make it
to the throne

271
00:26:36,578 --> 00:26:38,578
without wading through
a river of blood,

272
00:26:38,661 --> 00:26:39,786
maybe she'll show mercy

273
00:26:39,870 --> 00:26:42,078
to the person
who made that possible.

274
00:26:47,828 --> 00:26:50,578
Tens of thousands
of innocent lives...

275
00:26:51,870 --> 00:26:55,078
one not particularly
innocent dwarf...

276
00:26:56,494 --> 00:26:59,078
it seems like a fair trade.

277
00:27:05,619 --> 00:27:07,619
If it weren't for you,

278
00:27:07,703 --> 00:27:09,870
I never would've survived
my childhood.

279
00:27:11,995 --> 00:27:13,828
You would have.

280
00:27:21,452 --> 00:27:22,995
You were the only one

281
00:27:24,202 --> 00:27:27,120
who didn't treat me
like a monster.

282
00:27:29,703 --> 00:27:31,953
You were all I had.

283
00:28:42,828 --> 00:28:45,244
Eyes on the horizon!

284
00:28:46,536 --> 00:28:48,536
Load the scorpion!

285
00:29:01,786 --> 00:29:03,202
Archers, close up!

286
00:29:03,286 --> 00:29:04,661
Come on!

287
00:29:04,744 --> 00:29:06,744
Up to the espringal!

288
00:29:06,828 --> 00:29:09,036
To the back of it!

289
00:29:20,995 --> 00:29:22,703
Archers, line up!

290
00:29:30,744 --> 00:29:32,244
This way! Come on!

291
00:29:32,327 --> 00:29:33,911
Clear the streets now!

292
00:29:33,995 --> 00:29:36,244
- No!
- In, now.

293
00:29:36,327 --> 00:29:38,995
- And you, come on.
- Inside, now!

294
00:29:39,078 --> 00:29:40,494
Quickly.

295
00:29:40,578 --> 00:29:41,661
Yes. Follow down there.

296
00:29:41,744 --> 00:29:43,536
They're here.
Get to the Red Keep.

297
00:29:45,244 --> 00:29:47,202
- My son!
- Get inside!

298
00:29:51,536 --> 00:29:53,452
Just ahead of you,
I can see it!

299
00:29:53,536 --> 00:29:54,870
All right, move it!

300
00:29:54,953 --> 00:29:56,786
- Come on!
- Keep moving!

301
00:29:56,870 --> 00:29:58,595
- Keep going!
- Keep moving!

302
00:29:58,619 --> 00:30:00,369
- Quickly!
- All the way!

303
00:30:00,452 --> 00:30:02,369
- Come on!
- Come on!

304
00:30:02,452 --> 00:30:04,578
Hold your mother's hand!

305
00:30:17,327 --> 00:30:21,244
Make way for the Golden Company!

306
00:30:30,286 --> 00:30:31,536
Close the gate!

307
00:31:35,995 --> 00:31:39,036
If you hear the bells ring,
they've surrendered.

308
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:41,036
Call off your men.

309
00:31:53,369 --> 00:31:55,619
Move along now, lads.

310
00:32:24,369 --> 00:32:26,953
- That's it.
- Go on, move it.

311
00:32:30,202 --> 00:32:33,452
Come on, move, move.
Faster, faster. Come on, move it.

312
00:32:33,536 --> 00:32:35,369
- Keep going.
- Keep moving.

313
00:32:39,202 --> 00:32:41,578
- Move.
- Stay with him.

314
00:32:42,786 --> 00:32:44,369
- Hold on.
- Hold my hand.

315
00:32:44,452 --> 00:32:45,661
Get behind there.

316
00:32:45,744 --> 00:32:47,870
Close the gate!

317
00:32:47,953 --> 00:32:49,578
No more through.

318
00:32:52,452 --> 00:32:54,995
- No.
- No. Mommy.

319
00:32:55,078 --> 00:32:57,870
- Vicky! Please!
- No, please, sir!

320
00:32:57,953 --> 00:33:00,327
- Open the gate!
- Close the gate!

321
00:33:00,411 --> 00:33:02,244
- Open it!
- Open the gate!

322
00:33:02,327 --> 00:33:06,120
- Get back.
- Look, try that one. Go. Go.

323
00:33:11,953 --> 00:33:14,036
The gates are locked now!

324
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:15,452
Open!

325
00:33:15,536 --> 00:33:17,703
- Get back!
- Open the gate!

326
00:33:17,786 --> 00:33:20,494
Soldier! Soldier!

327
00:33:20,578 --> 00:33:23,578
- Please open the gate!
- Go back to your homes!

328
00:33:23,661 --> 00:33:25,161
Stay back! It's closed!

329
00:33:25,244 --> 00:33:26,661
Soldier!

330
00:33:28,161 --> 00:33:29,452
Move away! Stop!

331
00:33:29,536 --> 00:33:32,202
Let us in!

332
00:33:34,661 --> 00:33:36,828
We're not leaving!

333
00:34:45,286 --> 00:34:46,578
Turn!

334
00:35:05,744 --> 00:35:09,578
- Turn it around!
- Turn it around!

335
00:35:12,411 --> 00:35:14,411
Get back! Back!

336
00:35:18,995 --> 00:35:20,369
Fire!

337
00:35:40,619 --> 00:35:42,911
I can see her!

338
00:35:42,995 --> 00:35:44,161
Ready!

339
00:35:44,244 --> 00:35:45,578
Move!

340
00:35:47,786 --> 00:35:48,911
Fire!

341
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:55,078
- Reload!
- Reload!

342
00:35:55,161 --> 00:35:56,828
Faster!

343
00:35:56,911 --> 00:35:58,120
Hurry!

344
00:36:07,411 --> 00:36:08,452
Fire!

345
00:39:29,870 --> 00:39:31,536
Go!

346
00:39:34,786 --> 00:39:36,703
Run!

347
00:39:49,078 --> 00:39:50,161
Your Grace.

348
00:39:51,161 --> 00:39:53,494
All we need is one good shot.

349
00:39:53,578 --> 00:39:57,369
The scorpions have
all been destroyed, Your Grace.

350
00:39:59,202 --> 00:40:01,995
The Iron Fleet
hold Blackwater Bay.

351
00:40:03,411 --> 00:40:05,286
Euron killed one of her dragons.

352
00:40:05,369 --> 00:40:06,786
He can kill another.

353
00:40:06,870 --> 00:40:10,036
Your Grace,
the Iron Fleet is burning.

354
00:40:10,120 --> 00:40:12,286
The gates have been breached.

355
00:40:12,369 --> 00:40:13,828
The Golden Company...

356
00:40:13,911 --> 00:40:17,369
Our men will fight harder
than sellswords ever could.

357
00:40:19,036 --> 00:40:21,120
They will defend their queen
to the last man.

358
00:40:21,202 --> 00:40:24,411
- Yes, Your Grace.
- The Red Keep has never fallen.

359
00:40:24,494 --> 00:40:26,452
It won't fall today.

360
00:40:55,369 --> 00:40:56,953
No, no, no!

361
00:41:00,161 --> 00:41:02,120
Move, move!

362
00:42:03,744 --> 00:42:05,161
Run.

363
00:42:05,244 --> 00:42:06,744
Run!

364
00:42:06,828 --> 00:42:07,995
Come on!

365
00:42:59,619 --> 00:43:03,078
- Ring the bells!
- Ring the bells!

366
00:43:03,953 --> 00:43:05,286
The bells!

367
00:43:05,369 --> 00:43:08,452
- Ring the bells!
- Ring the bells!

368
00:43:08,536 --> 00:43:10,661
Ring the bloody bells!

369
00:43:10,744 --> 00:43:13,411
- Ring the bells!
- Ring the bells!

370
00:43:14,828 --> 00:43:16,703
Tell the queen to ring the bells.

371
00:43:16,786 --> 00:43:19,202
Ring the bells!
Ring the bell!

372
00:43:27,411 --> 00:43:28,744
This way.

373
00:43:33,995 --> 00:43:35,452
Ring the bell!

374
00:43:36,452 --> 00:43:38,161
Ring the bell!

375
00:43:38,244 --> 00:43:39,578
Ring them!

376
00:43:42,870 --> 00:43:44,953
Ring the bells!

377
00:43:48,327 --> 00:43:50,828
Ring the bells!

378
00:43:50,911 --> 00:43:54,369
- Ring the bells!
- Help us!

379
00:43:54,452 --> 00:43:55,744
In the name of the...

380
00:43:57,286 --> 00:43:59,244
Queen! We're surrounded!

381
00:44:06,452 --> 00:44:08,953
- Ring the bells!
- Now! Come on!

382
00:44:16,078 --> 00:44:17,120
Hurry up!

383
00:44:26,953 --> 00:44:28,202
Ring the bells!

384
00:46:53,120 --> 00:46:54,286
No!

385
00:46:54,369 --> 00:46:55,494
Get back!

386
00:46:55,578 --> 00:46:56,619
Get back!

387
00:46:58,120 --> 00:47:00,161
Stay! Stay!

388
00:48:22,953 --> 00:48:24,703
No, no, no, no, no.

389
00:48:33,786 --> 00:48:35,911
Quickly. Quickly.

390
00:48:37,953 --> 00:48:39,411
Stop!

391
00:49:02,744 --> 00:49:05,578
- Get off me! Get off, bitch!
- No, get off! Help! Help!

392
00:49:06,619 --> 00:49:07,703
No!

393
00:49:37,703 --> 00:49:38,911
Go!

394
00:49:40,286 --> 00:49:41,411
Go!

395
00:50:19,078 --> 00:50:20,953
Find somewhere to hide.

396
00:50:45,452 --> 00:50:46,703
My God!

397
00:51:05,661 --> 00:51:07,536
The Kingslayer.

398
00:51:10,036 --> 00:51:12,953
We need to get the
queen out of King's Landing.

399
00:51:13,036 --> 00:51:14,661
Listen.

400
00:51:14,744 --> 00:51:18,202
That's the sound
of a city dying.

401
00:51:20,161 --> 00:51:21,327
It's over.

402
00:51:21,411 --> 00:51:23,244
Well, maybe for you.

403
00:51:24,536 --> 00:51:27,578
If you kill another king
before you die...

404
00:51:28,786 --> 00:51:30,536
they'll sing about you forever.

405
00:51:31,578 --> 00:51:33,244
You're no king.

406
00:51:33,327 --> 00:51:34,744
Oh, but I am.

407
00:51:36,536 --> 00:51:38,244
And I fucked the queen.

408
00:51:41,911 --> 00:51:42,953
If I win...

409
00:51:44,202 --> 00:51:45,661
I'll bring your head to Cersei

410
00:51:45,744 --> 00:51:48,828
so you can kiss her
one last time.

411
00:53:32,494 --> 00:53:34,661
Your Grace, it isn't safe here
any longer.

412
00:53:34,744 --> 00:53:36,786
The Red Keep is the safest place
in the city.

413
00:53:36,870 --> 00:53:40,244
The Unsullied have breached
the gates of the Red Keep.

414
00:53:48,786 --> 00:53:51,953
Maegor's Holdfast
would be a better place

415
00:53:52,036 --> 00:53:53,411
to wait out the storm.

416
00:54:30,786 --> 00:54:32,744
You fought well...

417
00:54:33,744 --> 00:54:35,120
for a cripple.

418
00:55:19,452 --> 00:55:20,786
Another king for you.

419
00:55:36,036 --> 00:55:37,036
But I got you!

420
00:55:40,286 --> 00:55:41,327
I got you!

421
00:55:47,828 --> 00:55:50,661
I'm the man
who killed Jaime Lannister.

422
00:56:15,120 --> 00:56:16,202
Go home, girl.

423
00:56:17,327 --> 00:56:18,911
The fire will get her,

424
00:56:18,995 --> 00:56:20,744
or one of the Dothraki.

425
00:56:21,995 --> 00:56:24,703
Or maybe that dragon
will eat her.

426
00:56:24,786 --> 00:56:26,786
It doesn't matter. She's dead.

427
00:56:26,870 --> 00:56:29,661
And you'll be dead too
if you don't get out of here.

428
00:56:30,703 --> 00:56:32,078
I'm going to kill her.

429
00:56:33,619 --> 00:56:36,452
You think you wanted revenge
a long time?

430
00:56:36,536 --> 00:56:38,161
I've been after it all my life.

431
00:56:38,244 --> 00:56:40,411
It's all I care about.

432
00:56:40,494 --> 00:56:42,870
And look at me. Look at me!

433
00:56:44,870 --> 00:56:47,202
You wanna be like me?

434
00:56:54,036 --> 00:56:58,244
You come with me, you die here.

435
00:57:11,619 --> 00:57:13,036
Sandor.

436
00:57:19,911 --> 00:57:21,578
Thank you.

437
00:58:23,870 --> 00:58:25,619
Your Grace.

438
00:58:42,327 --> 00:58:44,661
Hello, big brother.

439
00:58:50,578 --> 00:58:53,161
Ser Gregor, stay by my side.

440
00:59:03,078 --> 00:59:04,452
Ser Gregor, I command you.

441
00:59:04,536 --> 00:59:06,078
Obey your queen, Ser Gregor.

442
01:00:03,411 --> 01:00:06,120
Yeah, that's you.

443
01:00:08,369 --> 01:00:10,244
That's what you've always been.

444
01:01:45,036 --> 01:01:46,327
You're hurt.

445
01:01:48,202 --> 01:01:49,536
It doesn't matter.

446
01:01:57,202 --> 01:01:59,036
You're bleeding.

447
01:03:41,578 --> 01:03:43,536
Alanna!

448
01:03:43,619 --> 01:03:46,036
Alanna! Have you seen my wife?

449
01:03:46,120 --> 01:03:47,911
Have you seen my wife?

450
01:03:47,995 --> 01:03:49,619
- Let go.
- Have you seen my wife?

451
01:04:05,536 --> 01:04:06,995
Out of the way!

452
01:04:34,578 --> 01:04:35,870
No!

453
01:05:06,744 --> 01:05:08,202
Oh.

454
01:05:37,494 --> 01:05:38,995
Take my hand.

455
01:05:39,078 --> 01:05:40,995
Take my hand.

456
01:05:41,078 --> 01:05:42,536
Get up. Get up.

457
01:05:51,911 --> 01:05:54,327
- No. No.
- Wait! Wait!

458
01:05:54,411 --> 01:05:55,411
No!

459
01:06:39,953 --> 01:06:41,494
Fucking die!

460
01:08:15,078 --> 01:08:17,452
We need to fall back!

461
01:08:17,536 --> 01:08:20,411
Fall back behind the wall!

462
01:08:21,578 --> 01:08:23,161
- Fall back!
- Fall back!

463
01:08:23,244 --> 01:08:24,744
Get out of the city!

464
01:08:26,244 --> 01:08:27,536
Fall back!

465
01:08:31,244 --> 01:08:32,619
Fall back!

466
01:08:32,703 --> 01:08:34,369
- Fall back!
- Fall back!

467
01:10:30,536 --> 01:10:32,911
You can't stay here.

468
01:10:32,995 --> 01:10:34,619
You have to keep moving.

469
01:10:34,703 --> 01:10:36,286
We can't go out there.

470
01:10:36,369 --> 01:10:37,369
You have to.

471
01:10:38,578 --> 01:10:40,411
Everyone out there is dead.

472
01:10:41,703 --> 01:10:43,870
If you stay here, you'll die.

473
01:10:45,494 --> 01:10:46,494
Follow me.

474
01:10:48,369 --> 01:10:49,411
Follow me!

475
01:10:52,953 --> 01:10:54,703
Come on, quickly. Come to me.

476
01:10:54,786 --> 01:10:56,578
Lean him up there.

477
01:10:56,661 --> 01:10:58,578
Come on, quickly. All of you!

478
01:11:02,578 --> 01:11:03,578
Run!

479
01:11:09,411 --> 01:11:10,411
Run!

480
01:11:15,244 --> 01:11:17,244
Mama!

481
01:11:17,327 --> 01:11:18,619
Mama!

482
01:11:18,703 --> 01:11:20,661
Mama! No.

483
01:11:20,744 --> 01:11:22,619
Mama! Mama!

484
01:11:23,953 --> 01:11:24,953
Mama!

485
01:11:29,744 --> 01:11:31,536
Get up.

486
01:11:31,619 --> 01:11:33,036
Get up!

487
01:11:36,953 --> 01:11:38,161
We have to keep moving.

488
01:11:39,703 --> 01:11:41,202
Take her.

489
01:11:41,286 --> 01:11:43,161
Take her!

490
01:11:43,244 --> 01:11:45,744
- Take her.
- Come on!

491
01:11:45,828 --> 01:11:46,828
Come on!

492
01:12:07,452 --> 01:12:08,452
This way.

493
01:12:58,828 --> 01:13:01,327
I want our baby to live.

494
01:13:04,161 --> 01:13:06,536
I want our baby to live.

495
01:13:09,120 --> 01:13:10,870
I want our baby to live.

496
01:13:12,536 --> 01:13:15,078
Don't let me die, Jaime.
Please don't let me die.

497
01:13:15,161 --> 01:13:16,286
It's all right.

498
01:13:16,369 --> 01:13:18,202
- Please don't let me die.
- It's all right.

499
01:13:18,286 --> 01:13:19,286
I don't want to die.

500
01:13:22,036 --> 01:13:23,786
Just look... Look at me.

501
01:13:23,870 --> 01:13:25,911
- Look at me.
- Not like this.

502
01:13:25,995 --> 01:13:27,452
Not like this. Not like this.

503
01:13:27,536 --> 01:13:29,286
Look... Look...
Look me in the eye.

504
01:13:29,369 --> 01:13:30,828
Don't look away. Don't look...

505
01:13:30,911 --> 01:13:33,161
Look at me! Just look at me.

506
01:13:37,703 --> 01:13:39,911
Nothing else matters.

507
01:13:42,452 --> 01:13:44,494
Nothing else matters.

508
01:13:44,578 --> 01:13:46,452
Only us.

509
01:19:58,452 --> 01:20:00,532
There's
something you need to know.

510
01:20:00,911 --> 01:20:02,828
Someone has betrayed me.

511
01:20:03,703 --> 01:20:04,703
Varys.

512
01:20:07,036 --> 01:20:08,619
He knows the truth about Jon?

513
01:20:09,120 --> 01:20:10,327
He does.

514
01:20:13,786 --> 01:20:15,786
Dany
is an incredibly strong person.

515
01:20:15,828 --> 01:20:18,911
She's also someone who has had
really close friendships

516
01:20:18,995 --> 01:20:21,995
and close advisors for her
entire run of the show.

517
01:20:22,078 --> 01:20:24,327
You look at those people
who have been closest to her

518
01:20:24,411 --> 01:20:25,536
for such a long time,

519
01:20:25,619 --> 01:20:27,578
and almost all of them
have either turned on her

520
01:20:27,661 --> 01:20:29,953
or died,
and she's very much alone.

521
01:20:30,036 --> 01:20:31,595
And that's a dangerous thing
for someone

522
01:20:31,619 --> 01:20:34,078
who's got so much power,
to feel that isolated.

523
01:20:34,161 --> 01:20:36,661
So at the very time
when she needs guidance

524
01:20:36,744 --> 01:20:39,703
and those kind of close
friendships and advice the most,

525
01:20:40,078 --> 01:20:41,078
everyone's gone.

526
01:20:46,244 --> 01:20:49,161
I think that Varys knew
that it was unlikely

527
01:20:49,244 --> 01:20:51,244
that he would survive
the attempt

528
01:20:51,327 --> 01:20:53,995
to overthrow Dany
in favor of Jon.

529
01:20:55,828 --> 01:20:58,120
And he also knew that he
ethically, in his mind,

530
01:20:58,202 --> 01:20:59,953
had no choice but to...

531
01:21:00,452 --> 01:21:01,995
try to do that anyway.

532
01:21:04,411 --> 01:21:05,661
It was me.

533
01:21:08,995 --> 01:21:09,995
Goodbye, old friend.

534
01:21:17,536 --> 01:21:19,744
I think that Tyrion
is saying goodbye

535
01:21:19,828 --> 01:21:23,036
to his best friend in the world
outside of his brother.

536
01:21:23,953 --> 01:21:24,953
Dracarys.

537
01:21:31,327 --> 01:21:34,327
And the amount of guilt
that he feels over being

538
01:21:34,411 --> 01:21:37,911
the cause for his best friend's
imminent death,

539
01:21:37,995 --> 01:21:40,036
it's hard to really
get your head around.

540
01:21:40,953 --> 01:21:42,411
I don't have love here.

541
01:21:44,578 --> 01:21:45,828
I only have fear.

542
01:21:46,619 --> 01:21:48,411
You will always be my queen.

543
01:21:48,703 --> 01:21:50,804
Jon Snow is someone
that she's fallen in love with.

544
01:21:50,828 --> 01:21:53,286
And as far as she's concerned,
by this point,

545
01:21:53,369 --> 01:21:56,619
Jon has betrayed her by telling
people about his true identity,

546
01:21:56,703 --> 01:21:58,995
and also the fact he's unable
to return her affections

547
01:21:59,078 --> 01:21:59,911
at this point.

548
01:21:59,995 --> 01:22:00,995
All right then.

549
01:22:09,078 --> 01:22:10,078
Let it be fear.

550
01:22:10,244 --> 01:22:12,202
I think that when she says,
"Let it be fear,"

551
01:22:12,286 --> 01:22:13,703
she's resigning herself

552
01:22:13,911 --> 01:22:15,953
to the fact that
she may have to

553
01:22:16,244 --> 01:22:18,995
get things done in a way
that isn't pleasant.

554
01:22:19,078 --> 01:22:22,452
And she may have to get things
done in a way that is horrible

555
01:22:22,744 --> 01:22:23,995
for lots of people.

556
01:22:24,078 --> 01:22:25,786
Mercy is our strength.

557
01:22:26,870 --> 01:22:29,244
Our mercy towards
future generations,

558
01:22:29,452 --> 01:22:32,036
he will never again be held
hostage by a tyrant.

559
01:22:32,911 --> 01:22:33,991
She chose violence.

560
01:22:34,327 --> 01:22:37,078
A Targaryen choosing violence
is a pretty terrifying thing.

561
01:22:43,619 --> 01:22:44,971
Even when you look back
to season one,

562
01:22:44,995 --> 01:22:47,202
when Khal Drogo gives
the golden crown to Viserys,

563
01:22:47,286 --> 01:22:50,870
and her reaction of watching
her brother's head melted off...

564
01:22:50,953 --> 01:22:51,953
He was no dragon.

565
01:22:52,244 --> 01:22:53,554
...and he was
a terrible brother, you know,

566
01:22:53,578 --> 01:22:55,202
so I don't think anyone
out there was...

567
01:22:55,286 --> 01:22:56,870
was crying when Viserys died,
but...

568
01:22:56,953 --> 01:22:58,953
there is something kind of
chilling about the way

569
01:22:59,036 --> 01:23:01,828
that Dany has responded
to the death of her enemies.

570
01:23:01,911 --> 01:23:03,995
And if circumstances
had been different,

571
01:23:04,078 --> 01:23:05,762
I don't think this side of Dany
ever would've come out.

572
01:23:05,786 --> 01:23:07,661
If Cersei hadn't betrayed her,

573
01:23:07,744 --> 01:23:09,452
if Cersei hadn't executed
Missandei,

574
01:23:09,536 --> 01:23:11,244
if Jon hadn't told her
the truth.

575
01:23:11,327 --> 01:23:14,244
Like, if all of these things had
happened in any different way,

576
01:23:14,536 --> 01:23:16,452
then I don't think
we'd be seeing this side of

577
01:23:16,536 --> 01:23:17,536
Daenerys Targaryen.

578
01:23:17,703 --> 01:23:20,078
I don't think she decided
ahead of time

579
01:23:20,411 --> 01:23:23,494
that she was...
going to do what she did.

580
01:23:23,578 --> 01:23:26,661
And then she sees the Red Keep,
which is, to her,

581
01:23:26,744 --> 01:23:28,744
the home that her family built

582
01:23:28,828 --> 01:23:32,036
when they first came over
to this country 300 years ago.

583
01:23:32,661 --> 01:23:35,536
It's in that moment,
on the walls of King's Landing,

584
01:23:35,619 --> 01:23:37,078
where she's looking
at that symbol

585
01:23:37,161 --> 01:23:38,953
of everything that was taken
from her,

586
01:23:39,369 --> 01:23:43,786
when she makes the decision to...
to make this personal.

587
01:23:58,327 --> 01:24:00,619
We wanted her to be
just death from above,

588
01:24:00,703 --> 01:24:02,619
as seen from the perspective
of the people

589
01:24:02,703 --> 01:24:05,578
who are on the business end
of that dragon.

590
01:24:05,828 --> 01:24:08,120
In most large stories like this,

591
01:24:08,202 --> 01:24:12,786
it seems like there's a tendency
to focus on the heroic figures

592
01:24:12,870 --> 01:24:16,661
and not pay much attention
to the people who may be

593
01:24:16,870 --> 01:24:19,327
suffering the repercussions
of the decisions made

594
01:24:19,411 --> 01:24:20,828
by those heroic people,
and we...

595
01:24:21,036 --> 01:24:23,870
we really wanted to keep
our perspective and our...

596
01:24:23,953 --> 01:24:25,995
our sympathies on the ground
at this moment

597
01:24:26,078 --> 01:24:29,619
'cause those are the people
who are really paying the price

598
01:24:29,703 --> 01:24:31,244
for the decisions
that she's making.

599
01:24:37,995 --> 01:24:40,953
I think that Jon is also
in a kind of denial.

600
01:24:41,036 --> 01:24:45,078
At first, the siege is a war,
soldiers killing soldiers.

601
01:24:45,578 --> 01:24:46,703
That's what war is.

602
01:24:47,036 --> 01:24:49,436
I think Jon is someone who's
always been a very good soldier,

603
01:24:49,494 --> 01:24:51,327
who has never enjoyed
being a soldier.

604
01:24:51,411 --> 01:24:52,786
He's been trained as a fighter

605
01:24:52,870 --> 01:24:55,327
from the time
he was a little boy,

606
01:24:55,411 --> 01:24:56,536
and he's quite good at it,

607
01:24:56,619 --> 01:24:58,220
he's quite good at leading men
into battle,

608
01:24:58,244 --> 01:24:59,244
and he also hates it.

609
01:24:59,536 --> 01:25:01,578
I think, for him,
it all starts out

610
01:25:01,661 --> 01:25:03,494
seeming like
it's gonna work out,

611
01:25:03,578 --> 01:25:04,929
and then it turns into
a nightmare.

612
01:25:04,953 --> 01:25:07,828
When she takes off
and starts burning the city,

613
01:25:07,911 --> 01:25:10,619
the Unsullied on the ground
and the Northmen on the ground,

614
01:25:10,703 --> 01:25:11,911
take that as their cue

615
01:25:11,995 --> 01:25:13,995
that it's a moral free-for-all.

616
01:25:15,286 --> 01:25:17,911
The good guys are behaving
like the bad guys,

617
01:25:18,161 --> 01:25:21,036
and the bad guys in this shot
are the ones who are doing

618
01:25:21,120 --> 01:25:24,744
all of these horrific things
around him, who are his own men.

619
01:25:24,828 --> 01:25:27,703
The moral lines that he's drawn,

620
01:25:28,120 --> 01:25:30,244
for himself, in his own life,

621
01:25:30,786 --> 01:25:34,744
can't be maintained for everyone
in all situations.

622
01:25:44,786 --> 01:25:45,786
Go home, girl.

623
01:25:46,078 --> 01:25:47,929
It's a small scene,
but it's also, for us,

624
01:25:47,953 --> 01:25:50,452
one of the most important scenes
in the whole episode because

625
01:25:50,870 --> 01:25:53,452
it's the culmination
of their story together.

626
01:25:53,536 --> 01:25:55,786
And you'll be dead too
if you don't get out of here.

627
01:25:56,870 --> 01:25:57,911
I'm going to kill her.

628
01:25:58,286 --> 01:26:01,244
The road to vengeance
always ends in one place.

629
01:26:01,327 --> 01:26:03,127
Which is what the Hound
is saying to her here.

630
01:26:03,202 --> 01:26:04,911
"I've made my choice
a long time ago,

631
01:26:04,995 --> 01:26:07,703
and this can only end
in one possible way for me.

632
01:26:07,786 --> 01:26:10,036
But for you,
you have so many other options."

633
01:26:10,120 --> 01:26:11,120
Look at me!

634
01:26:11,953 --> 01:26:13,202
You want to be like me?

635
01:26:14,786 --> 01:26:16,369
The Hound has genuinely come

636
01:26:16,452 --> 01:26:17,911
to have affection for Arya.

637
01:26:17,995 --> 01:26:18,995
I think he loves her

638
01:26:19,161 --> 01:26:20,428
as much as he's capable
of loving someone.

639
01:26:20,452 --> 01:26:22,578
And he knows that if she comes
with him at this point,

640
01:26:22,661 --> 01:26:24,101
she's not gonna make it
out of there.

641
01:26:25,120 --> 01:26:26,120
Sandor...

642
01:26:28,327 --> 01:26:29,327
Thank you.

643
01:26:35,995 --> 01:26:37,720
Hello, big brother.

644
01:26:43,995 --> 01:26:46,411
We've always wanted
to see these two face off again,

645
01:26:46,494 --> 01:26:47,661
and they finally did.

646
01:26:48,078 --> 01:26:50,369
It struck us that it would be
kind of

647
01:26:50,452 --> 01:26:51,452
apocalyptically beautiful

648
01:26:51,619 --> 01:26:53,953
to see them fighting
on this stairway to nowhere,

649
01:26:54,202 --> 01:26:57,995
with the sky in the background
and the dragon flying by

650
01:26:58,078 --> 01:26:59,327
and the flames everywhere.

651
01:27:00,369 --> 01:27:03,870
We knew that these two
were going to die together,

652
01:27:04,369 --> 01:27:05,369
at each other's hands,

653
01:27:05,744 --> 01:27:08,911
and we knew the Hound's death
had to be a death by fire.

654
01:27:09,244 --> 01:27:11,327
So the one thing stronger
in the Hound

655
01:27:11,411 --> 01:27:13,786
than his fear of fire
is his hatred of the person

656
01:27:13,870 --> 01:27:15,828
who put that fear there
in the first place.

657
01:27:24,286 --> 01:27:26,036
Feels like you needed
a perspective

658
01:27:26,244 --> 01:27:28,995
to carry you through
this horror.

659
01:27:29,078 --> 01:27:31,619
Like you need a Virgil
to take you through the hell

660
01:27:31,703 --> 01:27:32,703
that Dany's building.

661
01:27:32,911 --> 01:27:34,671
The reason we decided
to follow Arya

662
01:27:34,703 --> 01:27:36,369
out of King's Landing
and to see

663
01:27:36,452 --> 01:27:38,786
the fall of King's Landing
through her eyes is...

664
01:27:38,995 --> 01:27:40,887
something that we talked about
with an earlier episode.

665
01:27:40,911 --> 01:27:42,161
You just care a lot more

666
01:27:42,244 --> 01:27:43,887
when you're with a character
that you care about.

667
01:27:43,911 --> 01:27:46,744
So if we saw a lot of extras
running around on fire

668
01:27:46,828 --> 01:27:47,995
and buildings falling apart,

669
01:27:48,327 --> 01:27:49,911
it might've been
visually interesting,

670
01:27:49,995 --> 01:27:52,120
but it wouldn't have had
much of an emotional impact.

671
01:27:52,202 --> 01:27:54,036
But when you're there
on the ground with Arya,

672
01:27:54,120 --> 01:27:56,120
who's one of the people
we care the most about,

673
01:27:56,202 --> 01:27:58,494
then everything takes on
that much more of an edge.

674
01:27:58,786 --> 01:28:00,327
We knew
that the Hound would be

675
01:28:00,411 --> 01:28:02,703
convincing her to part ways
with him

676
01:28:02,786 --> 01:28:04,327
and to not go to her death.

677
01:28:04,411 --> 01:28:06,703
And once she decides she needs
to get out of the city,

678
01:28:06,786 --> 01:28:07,786
well, she's in...

679
01:28:08,078 --> 01:28:10,036
she's in the worst possible
place you can be.

680
01:28:10,120 --> 01:28:11,953
So she's gotta get from that
central point

681
01:28:12,036 --> 01:28:15,161
all the way outside
the walls of the city.

682
01:28:15,244 --> 01:28:16,870
It's the longest,
hardest journey

683
01:28:16,953 --> 01:28:19,452
anybody has to make
in the entire episode.

684
01:28:36,786 --> 01:28:38,096
You know,
there's a scene,

685
01:28:38,120 --> 01:28:39,286
several years ago,
where...

686
01:28:39,369 --> 01:28:41,786
Jaime and Bronn are talking
about how they wanna go,

687
01:28:41,870 --> 01:28:42,953
and Jaime's talking about

688
01:28:43,036 --> 01:28:44,744
dying in the arms
of the woman he loves.

689
01:28:44,828 --> 01:28:46,120
And this is it.

690
01:28:46,828 --> 01:28:48,870
I think he knows
that they belong together,

691
01:28:48,953 --> 01:28:50,428
that they came into this world
together,

692
01:28:50,452 --> 01:28:52,536
that they need to go
out of this world together.

693
01:29:00,452 --> 01:29:02,911
Once he goes through
the various exits,

694
01:29:02,995 --> 01:29:04,387
and they're all clogged up
with rubble,

695
01:29:04,411 --> 01:29:06,345
and there's no way out,
and he knows there's no way out,

696
01:29:06,369 --> 01:29:09,411
he's just trying to calm down
the woman he loves

697
01:29:09,494 --> 01:29:10,703
because he knows this is it.

698
01:29:10,786 --> 01:29:12,870
Look at me!
Just look at me.

699
01:29:17,286 --> 01:29:19,452
Nothing else matters.

700
01:29:22,120 --> 01:29:23,494
Nothing else matters.

701
01:29:24,494 --> 01:29:25,494
Only us.

702
01:29:26,036 --> 01:29:28,744
I think Jaime,
by the end of episode five,

703
01:29:28,828 --> 01:29:30,744
has come to terms
with who he really is.

704
01:29:31,120 --> 01:29:33,036
And he may not be happy
with who he really is,

705
01:29:33,120 --> 01:29:35,911
but he knows he's not,
he knows what matters to him,

706
01:29:35,995 --> 01:29:37,327
and Cersei's what matters
to him.
