1
00:00:06,466 --> 00:00:08,233
What if the Seven Kingdoms

2
00:00:08,257 --> 00:00:10,965
were ruled by a just woman
and an honorable man?

3
00:00:11,633 --> 00:00:13,424
You're Aegon Targaryen...

4
00:00:14,466 --> 00:00:16,090
true heir to the Iron Throne.

5
00:00:17,382 --> 00:00:18,591
You've always been.

6
00:00:20,424 --> 00:00:22,716
She doesn't
need to be my friend.

7
00:00:24,049 --> 00:00:25,174
But I am her queen.

8
00:00:25,716 --> 00:00:27,556
We must fight together now...

9
00:00:29,341 --> 00:00:30,341
or die.

10
00:00:30,841 --> 00:00:33,257
The things I do for love.

11
00:02:33,965 --> 00:02:37,841
When I was a child,
my brother would tell me a bedtime story...

12
00:02:39,257 --> 00:02:42,049
about the man
who murdered our father.

13
00:02:43,633 --> 00:02:46,965
Who stabbed him in the back
and cut his throat.

14
00:02:47,049 --> 00:02:49,965
Who sat down on the Iron Throne
and watched

15
00:02:50,049 --> 00:02:52,716
as his blood
poured onto the floor.

16
00:02:54,174 --> 00:02:56,674
He told me
other stories as well.

17
00:02:56,758 --> 00:03:00,049
About all the things
we would do to that man...

18
00:03:01,424 --> 00:03:03,257
once we took back
the Seven Kingdoms

19
00:03:03,341 --> 00:03:04,799
and had him in our grasp.

20
00:03:06,799 --> 00:03:10,174
Your sister pledged
to send her army north.

21
00:03:10,257 --> 00:03:11,341
She did.

22
00:03:11,424 --> 00:03:13,507
I don't see an army.

23
00:03:13,591 --> 00:03:17,299
I see one man, with one hand.

24
00:03:17,382 --> 00:03:19,132
It appears
your sister lied to me.

25
00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:24,257
She lied to me as well.

26
00:03:25,758 --> 00:03:28,466
She never had any intention
of sending her army north.

27
00:03:28,549 --> 00:03:33,466
She has Euron Greyjoy's fleet
and 20,000 fresh troops.

28
00:03:34,507 --> 00:03:36,382
The Golden Company from Essos,

29
00:03:36,466 --> 00:03:38,007
bought and paid for.

30
00:03:38,090 --> 00:03:39,883
Even if we defeat the dead,

31
00:03:39,965 --> 00:03:42,090
she'll have more than enough
to destroy the survivors.

32
00:03:42,174 --> 00:03:43,633
"We"?

33
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:46,633
I promised to fight
for the living.

34
00:03:46,716 --> 00:03:49,090
I intend to keep that promise.

35
00:03:51,007 --> 00:03:54,466
- Your Grace, I know my brother...
- Like you knew your sister?

36
00:03:56,299 --> 00:03:59,591
He came here alone, knowing
full well how he'd be received.

37
00:03:59,674 --> 00:04:03,132
Why would he do that
if he weren't telling the truth?

38
00:04:03,215 --> 00:04:06,132
Perhaps he trusts his
little brother to defend him,

39
00:04:06,215 --> 00:04:09,591
right up to the moment
he slits my throat.

40
00:04:09,674 --> 00:04:11,799
You're right.
We can't trust him.

41
00:04:12,965 --> 00:04:14,799
He attacked my father
in the streets.

42
00:04:14,883 --> 00:04:17,299
He tried to destroy
my house and my family,

43
00:04:17,382 --> 00:04:18,591
the same as he did yours.

44
00:04:18,674 --> 00:04:20,591
Do you want me to apologize?

45
00:04:20,674 --> 00:04:21,674
I won't.

46
00:04:22,674 --> 00:04:24,007
We were at war.

47
00:04:24,090 --> 00:04:26,758
Everything I did, I did
for my house and my family.

48
00:04:26,841 --> 00:04:27,841
I'd do it all again.

49
00:04:29,174 --> 00:04:31,341
The things we do for love.

50
00:04:37,883 --> 00:04:41,132
So why have you abandoned
your house and family now?

51
00:04:43,132 --> 00:04:45,174
Because this goes beyond loyalty.

52
00:04:48,633 --> 00:04:50,299
This is about survival.

53
00:04:57,299 --> 00:05:00,049
You don't know me well,
Your Grace.

54
00:05:01,716 --> 00:05:03,799
But I know Ser Jaime.

55
00:05:03,883 --> 00:05:05,507
He is a man of honor.

56
00:05:06,507 --> 00:05:08,424
I was his captor once.

57
00:05:08,507 --> 00:05:10,090
But when we were
both taken prisoner

58
00:05:10,174 --> 00:05:13,132
and the men holding us
tried to force themselves on me,

59
00:05:13,215 --> 00:05:14,716
Ser Jaime defended me.

60
00:05:15,883 --> 00:05:18,382
And lost his hand
because of it.

61
00:05:21,132 --> 00:05:25,716
Without him, my lady,
you would not be alive.

62
00:05:25,799 --> 00:05:28,424
He armed me, armored me,

63
00:05:28,507 --> 00:05:30,674
and sent me to find you
and bring you home

64
00:05:30,758 --> 00:05:34,382
because he'd sworn an oath
to your mother.

65
00:05:40,382 --> 00:05:41,924
You vouch for him?

66
00:05:44,883 --> 00:05:45,965
I do.

67
00:05:50,883 --> 00:05:52,924
You would fight beside him?

68
00:05:56,633 --> 00:05:57,924
I would.

69
00:06:02,382 --> 00:06:04,215
I trust you with my life.

70
00:06:05,633 --> 00:06:07,466
If you trust him with yours,

71
00:06:07,549 --> 00:06:09,758
we should let him stay.

72
00:06:15,090 --> 00:06:17,924
What does the Warden
of the North say about it?

73
00:06:23,549 --> 00:06:25,591
We need every man we can get.

74
00:06:35,299 --> 00:06:36,215
Very well.

75
00:06:57,799 --> 00:06:59,299
Thank you, Your Grace.

76
00:07:37,549 --> 00:07:40,716
Either you knew Cersei was lying
and let me believe otherwise,

77
00:07:40,799 --> 00:07:42,049
or you didn't know at all.

78
00:07:42,132 --> 00:07:44,215
Which makes you
either a traitor or a fool.

79
00:07:44,299 --> 00:07:46,549
- I was a fool.
- Not for the first time.

80
00:07:47,591 --> 00:07:49,633
Cersei still sits on the throne.

81
00:07:49,716 --> 00:07:51,424
If you can't help me
take it back,

82
00:07:51,507 --> 00:07:53,466
I'll find another Hand who can.

83
00:07:58,466 --> 00:08:00,758
I suspect one of you
will be wearing this

84
00:08:00,841 --> 00:08:02,924
before it's all over.

85
00:08:09,090 --> 00:08:10,215
Coming through.

86
00:08:56,424 --> 00:08:58,299
Don't you have something better
to do?

87
00:08:58,382 --> 00:09:00,674
You make my weapon yet?

88
00:09:00,758 --> 00:09:04,758
Just as soon as I'm done
making a few thousand of these.

89
00:09:04,841 --> 00:09:06,382
You should make mine first.

90
00:09:06,466 --> 00:09:08,507
And make sure
it's stronger than this.

91
00:09:09,965 --> 00:09:11,466
It's strong enough.

92
00:09:15,507 --> 00:09:18,507
It's going to be safer
down in the crypt, you know.

93
00:09:19,799 --> 00:09:21,883
Are you going to be
down in the crypt?

94
00:09:21,965 --> 00:09:24,090
- No, but...
- But you're a fighter.

95
00:09:25,299 --> 00:09:26,424
I've done my share.

96
00:09:28,466 --> 00:09:30,007
You've fought them?

97
00:09:30,090 --> 00:09:32,174
I did. Some of them.

98
00:09:33,299 --> 00:09:34,591
How many?

99
00:09:34,674 --> 00:09:35,674
A few.

100
00:09:37,132 --> 00:09:38,341
That was enough.

101
00:09:41,132 --> 00:09:42,758
What are they like?

102
00:09:43,799 --> 00:09:44,799
Bad.

103
00:09:46,507 --> 00:09:47,424
Really bad.

104
00:09:47,507 --> 00:09:49,132
"Really bad"?

105
00:09:51,841 --> 00:09:55,507
Even a smith's apprentice
can do better than "really bad."

106
00:09:55,591 --> 00:09:57,883
What do they look like?
What do they smell like?

107
00:09:57,965 --> 00:10:00,090
How do they move?
How hard are they to kill?

108
00:10:00,174 --> 00:10:01,758
Look,
I know you want to fight.

109
00:10:01,841 --> 00:10:05,174
And I know you're not scared
of rapers or murderers or...

110
00:10:05,257 --> 00:10:07,007
This is different. This is...

111
00:10:08,007 --> 00:10:09,382
This is death.

112
00:10:09,466 --> 00:10:11,549
You want to know
what they're like? Death.

113
00:10:11,633 --> 00:10:13,466
That's what they're like.

114
00:10:21,341 --> 00:10:22,633
I know Death.

115
00:10:25,424 --> 00:10:26,507
He's got many faces.

116
00:10:29,841 --> 00:10:31,965
I look forward
to seeing this one.

117
00:10:39,549 --> 00:10:42,215
- My weapon?
- I'll get right on it.

118
00:11:16,341 --> 00:11:18,591
I'm sorry
for what I did to you.

119
00:11:21,924 --> 00:11:23,965
You weren't sorry then.

120
00:11:25,174 --> 00:11:27,716
You were protecting
your family.

121
00:11:29,049 --> 00:11:31,174
I'm not that person anymore.

122
00:11:31,257 --> 00:11:32,507
You still would be,

123
00:11:32,591 --> 00:11:35,466
if you hadn't pushed me
out of that window.

124
00:11:35,549 --> 00:11:38,215
And I would still be
Brandon Stark.

125
00:11:39,215 --> 00:11:41,965
- You're not?
- No.

126
00:11:42,049 --> 00:11:44,299
I'm something else now.

127
00:11:45,591 --> 00:11:47,257
You're not angry at me.

128
00:11:48,382 --> 00:11:49,841
I'm not angry at anyone.

129
00:11:49,924 --> 00:11:51,924
Why didn't you tell them?

130
00:11:52,007 --> 00:11:54,591
You won't be able to help us
in this fight

131
00:11:54,674 --> 00:11:56,257
if I let them murder you first.

132
00:12:01,174 --> 00:12:03,007
What about afterwards?

133
00:12:03,090 --> 00:12:06,174
How do you know
there is an afterwards?

134
00:12:16,799 --> 00:12:17,965
Next up.

135
00:12:23,924 --> 00:12:26,299
Put a marker in the ground!

136
00:12:27,633 --> 00:12:29,924
Bring it up to the wall!

137
00:12:30,007 --> 00:12:31,841
Up to the wall. All right.

138
00:12:31,924 --> 00:12:34,132
- All right.
- All right.

139
00:12:35,549 --> 00:12:38,341
Well, here we are.

140
00:12:38,424 --> 00:12:39,924
Yes, here we are.

141
00:12:40,007 --> 00:12:41,424
Together again.

142
00:12:45,007 --> 00:12:46,965
And the masses rejoice.

143
00:12:48,674 --> 00:12:50,883
How do they feel
about their new queen?

144
00:12:50,965 --> 00:12:52,507
She's your new queen too.

145
00:12:54,799 --> 00:12:56,090
They remember what happened

146
00:12:56,174 --> 00:12:58,633
the last time Targaryens
brought dragons north.

147
00:12:59,466 --> 00:13:00,591
They'll come around

148
00:13:00,674 --> 00:13:02,424
once they see
Daenerys is different.

149
00:13:02,507 --> 00:13:04,883
And she is? Different?

150
00:13:04,965 --> 00:13:06,257
She is.

151
00:13:06,341 --> 00:13:08,507
- You're sure about her?
- I am.

152
00:13:08,591 --> 00:13:11,090
She didn't seem sure about you.

153
00:13:11,174 --> 00:13:13,090
It's hard to blame her.

154
00:13:13,174 --> 00:13:15,132
I made a mistake
common to clever people.

155
00:13:15,215 --> 00:13:18,174
- I underestimated my opponents.
- Hmm.

156
00:13:18,257 --> 00:13:21,507
Cersei told me the pregnancy
had changed her.

157
00:13:21,591 --> 00:13:23,466
A chance for you both
to start again.

158
00:13:23,549 --> 00:13:24,841
And I believed her.

159
00:13:24,924 --> 00:13:26,591
That stuff can go on the end.

160
00:13:26,674 --> 00:13:29,341
Was she lying
about the baby too?

161
00:13:31,007 --> 00:13:33,007
No, that part is real.

162
00:13:36,466 --> 00:13:40,007
She's always been good
at using the truth to tell lies.

163
00:13:40,090 --> 00:13:41,924
I wouldn't be
too hard on yourself.

164
00:13:42,007 --> 00:13:43,633
She's fooled me
more than anybody.

165
00:13:43,716 --> 00:13:45,883
No, he's right there.

166
00:13:45,965 --> 00:13:47,633
What?

167
00:13:47,716 --> 00:13:50,132
She never fooled you.

168
00:13:50,215 --> 00:13:52,883
You always knew
exactly what she was,

169
00:13:52,965 --> 00:13:54,382
and you loved her anyway.

170
00:14:05,883 --> 00:14:06,924
So...

171
00:14:08,257 --> 00:14:11,591
...we're going to die
at Winterfell.

172
00:14:13,090 --> 00:14:15,591
Not the death
I would've chosen.

173
00:14:16,758 --> 00:14:18,299
I always pictured myself

174
00:14:18,382 --> 00:14:20,257
dying in my own bed,

175
00:14:20,341 --> 00:14:21,716
the age of 80,

176
00:14:21,799 --> 00:14:24,424
with a belly full of wine and
- ...a girl's mouth

177
00:14:24,507 --> 00:14:26,758
- around your cock.
- around my cock.

178
00:14:31,257 --> 00:14:33,090
At least Cersei
won't get to murder me.

179
00:14:33,174 --> 00:14:35,716
I'm sure I'll feel
some satisfaction

180
00:14:35,799 --> 00:14:37,257
denying her that pleasure

181
00:14:37,341 --> 00:14:40,341
while I'm being ripped apart
by dead men.

182
00:14:43,591 --> 00:14:45,424
Maybe after I'm dead...

183
00:14:46,549 --> 00:14:48,257
I'll march down
to King's Landing

184
00:14:48,341 --> 00:14:49,633
and rip her apart.

185
00:14:49,716 --> 00:14:51,633
You will see the Army of the Dead.

186
00:15:03,007 --> 00:15:04,007
Good.

187
00:15:21,341 --> 00:15:23,507
Good. Yes, aim.

188
00:15:26,883 --> 00:15:28,090
Don't rush.

189
00:15:28,174 --> 00:15:29,174
Come forward.

190
00:15:31,090 --> 00:15:32,924
- Come on.
- Ser Jaime.

191
00:15:33,007 --> 00:15:34,674
Lady Brienne.

192
00:15:42,174 --> 00:15:45,424
- He's come a long way.
- He's all right.

193
00:15:45,507 --> 00:15:47,049
One more time. Come on.

194
00:15:47,132 --> 00:15:50,424
- Still has a lot to learn.
- I'm sure you'll teach him.

195
00:15:50,507 --> 00:15:51,716
Better, better.

196
00:15:51,799 --> 00:15:54,257
I've been told you're commanding
the left flank.

197
00:15:54,341 --> 00:15:55,674
I am.

198
00:15:55,758 --> 00:15:58,507
It's, uh... It's good ground.

199
00:15:58,591 --> 00:16:00,215
It is.

200
00:16:00,299 --> 00:16:03,090
The rise, it should give us
some advantage.

201
00:16:03,174 --> 00:16:04,716
If we can keep
a tight formation,

202
00:16:04,799 --> 00:16:06,799
we might be able
to beat them back.

203
00:16:06,924 --> 00:16:09,132
Yes, I think you're right.

204
00:16:09,215 --> 00:16:10,965
- What are you doing?
- What?

205
00:16:11,049 --> 00:16:13,716
- I think you know.
- I truly don't.

206
00:16:13,799 --> 00:16:16,049
We have never had a conversation
last this long

207
00:16:16,132 --> 00:16:17,841
without you insulting me.
Not once.

208
00:16:17,924 --> 00:16:19,007
You want me to insult you?

209
00:16:19,090 --> 00:16:20,215
- No!
- Good.

210
00:16:27,049 --> 00:16:29,215
I came to Winterfell because...

211
00:16:34,257 --> 00:16:36,382
I'm not the fighter
I used to be.

212
00:16:38,257 --> 00:16:40,799
But I'd be honored
to serve under your command,

213
00:16:40,883 --> 00:16:42,257
if you'll have me.

214
00:16:51,507 --> 00:16:53,049
I better get back.

215
00:17:14,090 --> 00:17:15,591
Forgive me, khaleesi.

216
00:17:17,965 --> 00:17:20,341
Have you done something
to offend me?

217
00:17:20,424 --> 00:17:21,549
Many things.

218
00:17:21,633 --> 00:17:23,924
Long ago and long forgiven.

219
00:17:24,007 --> 00:17:25,549
But you did forgive,

220
00:17:26,549 --> 00:17:28,090
despite my failures.

221
00:17:30,633 --> 00:17:34,007
When I heard you'd named Tyrion
your Hand,

222
00:17:35,299 --> 00:17:37,215
it broke my heart.

223
00:17:37,299 --> 00:17:38,965
When I named him Hand,

224
00:17:39,049 --> 00:17:41,883
I didn't know
if I'd ever see you again.

225
00:17:41,965 --> 00:17:43,841
You made the right choice.

226
00:17:43,924 --> 00:17:46,716
I wasn't under the impression
you liked him very much.

227
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:48,049
I didn't.

228
00:17:48,132 --> 00:17:49,591
His mouth
hardly stopped moving

229
00:17:49,674 --> 00:17:51,132
between Volantis
and Meereen.

230
00:17:51,215 --> 00:17:53,841
It was all I could do
not to throw him in the sea.

231
00:17:57,591 --> 00:18:00,507
But the mind behind
all those words...

232
00:18:02,716 --> 00:18:04,716
He's made mistakes.

233
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:06,257
Serious mistakes.

234
00:18:08,132 --> 00:18:09,299
As have we all.

235
00:18:11,007 --> 00:18:12,382
He owns his

236
00:18:13,466 --> 00:18:14,716
and learns from them.

237
00:18:16,007 --> 00:18:17,841
You're advising me
to forgive the man

238
00:18:17,924 --> 00:18:19,174
who stole your position?

239
00:18:20,758 --> 00:18:21,841
I am.

240
00:18:23,215 --> 00:18:25,007
And one other suggestion,

241
00:18:25,090 --> 00:18:27,424
if you'll allow me.

242
00:18:27,507 --> 00:18:29,965
The moment we can get the last infantryman

243
00:18:30,049 --> 00:18:32,507
out onto the field,
we should shut the gates.

244
00:18:32,591 --> 00:18:34,674
Keep them open for as long as you can.

245
00:18:34,758 --> 00:18:37,674
There are still people coming in
from the countryside.

246
00:18:43,341 --> 00:18:45,965
Lady Sansa, I was hoping
we could speak alone.

247
00:19:04,007 --> 00:19:05,174
I thought you and I

248
00:19:05,257 --> 00:19:07,174
were on the verge
of agreement before.

249
00:19:07,257 --> 00:19:08,257
About Ser Jaime.

250
00:19:10,299 --> 00:19:13,799
Brienne has been
loyal to me, always.

251
00:19:13,883 --> 00:19:16,132
I trust her more than anyone.

252
00:19:16,215 --> 00:19:19,215
I wish I could have that kind
of faith in my advisors.

253
00:19:20,257 --> 00:19:22,466
Tyrion is a good man.

254
00:19:22,549 --> 00:19:25,215
He was never anything
but decent towards me.

255
00:19:25,299 --> 00:19:29,341
I didn't ask him to be my Hand
simply because he was good.

256
00:19:29,424 --> 00:19:31,299
I asked him to be my Hand

257
00:19:31,382 --> 00:19:34,299
because he was good,
and intelligent,

258
00:19:34,382 --> 00:19:36,758
and ruthless when he had to be.

259
00:19:38,215 --> 00:19:40,090
He never should have
trusted Cersei.

260
00:19:41,174 --> 00:19:43,257
You never should have either.

261
00:19:46,758 --> 00:19:48,466
I thought he knew his sister.

262
00:19:50,299 --> 00:19:52,090
Families are complicated.

263
00:19:53,466 --> 00:19:55,382
Ours certainly have been.

264
00:19:57,341 --> 00:19:59,633
A sad thing to have in common.

265
00:20:01,633 --> 00:20:03,674
We have other things in common.

266
00:20:03,758 --> 00:20:05,841
We've both known what it means
to lead people

267
00:20:05,924 --> 00:20:09,299
who aren't inclined
to accept a woman's rule.

268
00:20:09,382 --> 00:20:11,507
And we've both done
a damn good job of it,

269
00:20:11,591 --> 00:20:13,299
from what I can tell.

270
00:20:15,507 --> 00:20:20,591
And yet, I can't help but feel
we're at odds with one another.

271
00:20:21,758 --> 00:20:22,841
Why is that?

272
00:20:27,299 --> 00:20:28,299
Your brother.

273
00:20:31,633 --> 00:20:33,424
He loves you, you know that.

274
00:20:35,090 --> 00:20:36,257
That bothers you.

275
00:20:36,341 --> 00:20:39,883
Men do stupid things for women.

276
00:20:39,965 --> 00:20:42,007
They're easily manipulated.

277
00:20:45,299 --> 00:20:47,883
All my life,
I've known one goal:

278
00:20:47,965 --> 00:20:49,424
the Iron Throne.

279
00:20:50,424 --> 00:20:51,883
Taking it back from the people

280
00:20:51,965 --> 00:20:55,007
who destroyed my family,
and almost destroyed yours.

281
00:20:55,090 --> 00:20:57,633
My war was against them.

282
00:20:59,841 --> 00:21:01,299
Until I met Jon.

283
00:21:03,466 --> 00:21:06,049
Now I'm here,
half a world away,

284
00:21:06,132 --> 00:21:08,591
fighting Jon's war
alongside him.

285
00:21:08,674 --> 00:21:11,841
Tell me, who manipulated whom?

286
00:21:19,549 --> 00:21:23,633
I should have thanked you
the moment you arrived.

287
00:21:24,965 --> 00:21:26,341
That was a mistake.

288
00:21:29,174 --> 00:21:31,299
I'm here because
I love your brother...

289
00:21:32,965 --> 00:21:35,007
and I trust him...

290
00:21:35,090 --> 00:21:38,299
and I know
he's true to his word.

291
00:21:38,382 --> 00:21:40,090
He's only the second man
in my life

292
00:21:40,174 --> 00:21:41,758
I can say that about.

293
00:21:43,549 --> 00:21:44,799
Who was the first?

294
00:21:44,883 --> 00:21:46,633
Someone taller.

295
00:21:51,883 --> 00:21:54,174
And what happens afterwards?

296
00:21:55,674 --> 00:21:59,090
We defeat the dead,
we destroy Cersei.

297
00:22:00,299 --> 00:22:01,716
What happens then?

298
00:22:03,299 --> 00:22:04,883
I take the Iron Throne.

299
00:22:07,841 --> 00:22:09,090
What about the North?

300
00:22:10,382 --> 00:22:12,299
It was taken from us,

301
00:22:12,382 --> 00:22:14,090
and we took it back.

302
00:22:14,174 --> 00:22:17,799
And we said we'd never bow
to anyone else again.

303
00:22:17,883 --> 00:22:19,424
What about the North?

304
00:22:26,758 --> 00:22:29,674
Apologies, my lady.
Your Grace...

305
00:22:29,758 --> 00:22:31,424
What is it?

306
00:22:53,174 --> 00:22:54,883
My queen.

307
00:22:54,965 --> 00:22:56,299
Your sister?

308
00:22:56,382 --> 00:22:58,341
She only has a few ships,

309
00:22:58,424 --> 00:22:59,883
and she couldn't
sail them here.

310
00:22:59,965 --> 00:23:03,007
So she's sailing
to the Iron Islands instead,

311
00:23:03,090 --> 00:23:04,924
to take them back in your name.

312
00:23:05,007 --> 00:23:06,466
But why aren't you with her?

313
00:23:12,924 --> 00:23:15,591
I want to fight for Winterfell,
Lady Sansa...

314
00:23:17,591 --> 00:23:19,341
if you'll have me.

315
00:23:49,633 --> 00:23:51,132
Milord, we're not soldiers.

316
00:23:51,215 --> 00:23:52,507
You are now.

317
00:23:56,841 --> 00:23:59,424
Look, I made it through
most of my years

318
00:23:59,507 --> 00:24:01,341
without ever
getting near a fight,

319
00:24:01,424 --> 00:24:03,799
but then I survived
the Battle of the Bastards.

320
00:24:03,883 --> 00:24:05,382
Right outside these walls.

321
00:24:05,466 --> 00:24:08,883
If I can live through that,
you can live through this.

322
00:24:10,424 --> 00:24:13,257
They'll outfit you with weapons
at the forge.

323
00:24:13,341 --> 00:24:14,341
Right that way.

324
00:24:16,174 --> 00:24:17,382
Thank you.

325
00:24:19,132 --> 00:24:21,674
When the time comes,
you'll be down in the crypts.

326
00:24:21,758 --> 00:24:23,257
They're the safest place to be.

327
00:24:23,341 --> 00:24:25,341
Through that archway
right over there.

328
00:24:26,174 --> 00:24:27,174
Thank you.

329
00:24:29,841 --> 00:24:32,257
Hey, hey, who's next, lads?

330
00:24:32,341 --> 00:24:35,507
Thank you, sir.
Come back!

331
00:24:35,591 --> 00:24:37,382
Which way should I go?

332
00:24:42,341 --> 00:24:44,466
Which way do you want to go?

333
00:24:44,549 --> 00:24:46,799
All the children
will be going below

334
00:24:46,883 --> 00:24:49,132
when the time comes.

335
00:24:49,215 --> 00:24:51,716
But both me brothers
were soldiers.

336
00:24:53,674 --> 00:24:55,883
I want to fight too.

337
00:25:00,382 --> 00:25:02,299
That's good to hear.

338
00:25:02,382 --> 00:25:04,299
I'm going to be in the crypt
with my son,

339
00:25:04,382 --> 00:25:06,507
and I'd feel a lot better
with you down there

340
00:25:06,591 --> 00:25:09,965
- to protect us.
- I'm sure a lot of people would.

341
00:25:15,633 --> 00:25:18,090
All right.
I'll defend the crypt, then.

342
00:25:29,424 --> 00:25:31,049
Riders coming in!

343
00:25:54,215 --> 00:25:56,215
My little crow.

344
00:25:56,299 --> 00:25:57,507
I thought we'd lost you.

345
00:25:58,549 --> 00:25:59,965
Almost.

346
00:26:04,965 --> 00:26:06,799
Put them in the stables.

347
00:26:10,049 --> 00:26:11,549
How did you find each other?

348
00:26:11,633 --> 00:26:13,591
We met up at the Last Hearth.

349
00:26:13,674 --> 00:26:15,507
The dead got there first.

350
00:26:19,758 --> 00:26:20,883
The Umbers?

351
00:26:20,965 --> 00:26:22,965
Fighting for
the Night King now.

352
00:26:24,299 --> 00:26:26,716
We had to travel around them
to get here.

353
00:26:26,799 --> 00:26:29,382
Whoever's not here now

354
00:26:29,466 --> 00:26:30,674
is with them.

355
00:26:30,758 --> 00:26:33,591
How long do we have?

356
00:26:33,674 --> 00:26:36,382
Before the sun
comes up tomorrow.

357
00:26:42,466 --> 00:26:44,507
The big woman still here?

358
00:26:47,674 --> 00:26:49,758
They're coming.

359
00:26:49,841 --> 00:26:50,841
Next.

360
00:26:50,924 --> 00:26:52,924
We have dragonglass

361
00:26:53,007 --> 00:26:55,132
and Valyrian steel.

362
00:26:59,341 --> 00:27:01,215
But there are too many of them.

363
00:27:02,424 --> 00:27:03,591
Far too many.

364
00:27:05,674 --> 00:27:07,507
Our enemy doesn't tire.

365
00:27:09,758 --> 00:27:10,841
Doesn't stop.

366
00:27:12,549 --> 00:27:13,549
Doesn't feel.

367
00:27:14,965 --> 00:27:18,049
We can't beat them
in a straight fight.

368
00:27:18,132 --> 00:27:19,674
So, what can we do?

369
00:27:21,382 --> 00:27:24,591
The Night King made them all.
They follow his command.

370
00:27:25,633 --> 00:27:26,758
If he falls...

371
00:27:28,382 --> 00:27:30,174
Getting to him
may be our best chance.

372
00:27:30,257 --> 00:27:32,883
If that's true,
he'll never expose himself.

373
00:27:33,841 --> 00:27:34,924
Yes, he will.

374
00:27:36,215 --> 00:27:37,758
He'll come for me.

375
00:27:39,424 --> 00:27:43,215
He's tried before, many times,
with many Three-Eyed Ravens.

376
00:27:44,299 --> 00:27:45,299
Why?

377
00:27:46,507 --> 00:27:47,549
What does he want?

378
00:27:47,633 --> 00:27:49,215
An endless night.

379
00:27:50,841 --> 00:27:54,799
He wants to erase this world,
and I am its memory.

380
00:27:54,883 --> 00:27:57,090
That's what death is,
isn't it?

381
00:27:59,132 --> 00:28:00,257
Forgetting.

382
00:28:02,965 --> 00:28:04,215
Being forgotten.

383
00:28:05,257 --> 00:28:06,758
If we forget where we've been

384
00:28:06,841 --> 00:28:07,883
and what we've done,

385
00:28:07,965 --> 00:28:09,633
we're not men anymore.

386
00:28:10,674 --> 00:28:12,507
Just animals.

387
00:28:12,591 --> 00:28:14,424
Your memories
don't come from books.

388
00:28:15,591 --> 00:28:17,591
Your stories
aren't just stories.

389
00:28:17,674 --> 00:28:20,174
If I wanted
to erase the world of men,

390
00:28:20,257 --> 00:28:21,382
I'd start with you.

391
00:28:22,424 --> 00:28:23,466
How will he find you?

392
00:28:23,549 --> 00:28:25,424
His mark is on me.

393
00:28:26,965 --> 00:28:28,965
He always knows where I am.

394
00:28:29,049 --> 00:28:30,549
We'll put you in the crypt,

395
00:28:30,633 --> 00:28:32,883
- where it's safest.
- No.

396
00:28:32,965 --> 00:28:34,549
We need to lure him
into the open

397
00:28:34,633 --> 00:28:36,382
before his army
destroys us all.

398
00:28:36,466 --> 00:28:38,382
I'll wait for him
in the Godswood.

399
00:28:38,466 --> 00:28:40,341
You want us to use you as bait?

400
00:28:40,424 --> 00:28:42,215
We're not leaving you alone
out there.

401
00:28:42,299 --> 00:28:44,007
He won't be.
I'll stay with him.

402
00:28:45,174 --> 00:28:46,633
With the Ironborn.

403
00:28:49,507 --> 00:28:51,924
I took this castle from you.

404
00:28:52,007 --> 00:28:53,633
Let me defend you now.

405
00:29:02,215 --> 00:29:05,215
We'll hold off the rest of them
for as long as we can.

406
00:29:05,299 --> 00:29:06,549
When the time comes,

407
00:29:06,633 --> 00:29:08,382
Ser Davos and I
will be on the walls,

408
00:29:08,466 --> 00:29:10,424
to give you the signal
to light the trench.

409
00:29:10,507 --> 00:29:14,049
Ser Davos is perfectly capable
of waving a torch on his own.

410
00:29:14,132 --> 00:29:16,341
You'll be in the crypt.

411
00:29:16,424 --> 00:29:18,257
Your Grace,
I have fought before,

412
00:29:18,341 --> 00:29:19,424
I can do it again.

413
00:29:19,507 --> 00:29:21,007
Alongside the men and women

414
00:29:21,090 --> 00:29:22,090
risking their lives.

415
00:29:22,132 --> 00:29:23,758
There are thousands of them

416
00:29:23,841 --> 00:29:25,424
and only one of you.

417
00:29:25,507 --> 00:29:27,132
You can't fight
as well as they can,

418
00:29:27,215 --> 00:29:29,758
but you can think
better than any of them.

419
00:29:29,841 --> 00:29:32,257
You're here
because of your mind.

420
00:29:32,341 --> 00:29:34,132
If we survive, I'll need it.

421
00:29:37,257 --> 00:29:39,924
The dragons should give us
an edge in the field.

422
00:29:40,007 --> 00:29:43,549
If they're in the field,
they're not protecting Bran.

423
00:29:43,633 --> 00:29:45,090
We need to be near him.

424
00:29:45,174 --> 00:29:46,049
Not too near,

425
00:29:46,132 --> 00:29:47,424
or the Night King won't come.

426
00:29:47,507 --> 00:29:49,716
But close enough to pursue him
when he does.

427
00:29:49,799 --> 00:29:51,758
Dragonfire will stop him?

428
00:29:51,841 --> 00:29:53,549
I don't know.

429
00:29:53,633 --> 00:29:55,215
No one's ever tried.

430
00:30:01,716 --> 00:30:03,549
We're all going to die.

431
00:30:05,883 --> 00:30:08,341
But at least we die together.

432
00:30:12,049 --> 00:30:13,716
Let's get some rest.

433
00:30:22,507 --> 00:30:23,507
Your Grace.

434
00:30:38,716 --> 00:30:40,674
Do you need help?

435
00:30:40,758 --> 00:30:42,049
No.

436
00:30:43,090 --> 00:30:45,257
You've had a strange journey.

437
00:30:45,341 --> 00:30:46,716
Stranger than most.

438
00:30:48,883 --> 00:30:50,924
I'd like to hear about it.

439
00:30:53,549 --> 00:30:55,507
It's a long story.

440
00:30:55,591 --> 00:30:57,591
If only we were trapped
in a castle...

441
00:30:58,924 --> 00:31:02,424
in the middle of winter,
with nowhere to go.

442
00:31:24,299 --> 00:31:25,424
Hello.

443
00:31:45,466 --> 00:31:48,049
When Daenerys takes her throne...

444
00:31:48,132 --> 00:31:50,132
there will be
no place for us here.

445
00:31:51,299 --> 00:31:53,674
I am loyal to my queen.

446
00:31:53,758 --> 00:31:56,799
I will fight for her
until her enemies are defeated,

447
00:31:56,883 --> 00:32:00,633
but when the war is over
and she has won...

448
00:32:03,633 --> 00:32:06,466
...do you want
to grow old in this place?

449
00:32:08,924 --> 00:32:11,591
Is there nothing
else you want to do,

450
00:32:11,674 --> 00:32:13,799
nothing else you want to see?

451
00:32:15,883 --> 00:32:17,007
Naath.

452
00:32:18,299 --> 00:32:20,841
I'd like to see
the beaches again.

453
00:32:23,174 --> 00:32:25,215
Then I will take you there.

454
00:32:25,299 --> 00:32:27,049
My people are peaceful.

455
00:32:28,215 --> 00:32:30,716
We cannot protect ourselves.

456
00:32:30,799 --> 00:32:32,883
My people are not peaceful.

457
00:32:33,799 --> 00:32:35,341
We will protect you.

458
00:32:47,007 --> 00:32:48,716
Yes, sir.

459
00:32:52,007 --> 00:32:53,883
Have you told her yet?

460
00:32:57,049 --> 00:32:58,049
No.

461
00:32:59,382 --> 00:33:00,549
Mm-hmm.

462
00:33:01,758 --> 00:33:02,924
Being careful.

463
00:33:06,215 --> 00:33:07,549
Biding your time.

464
00:33:09,466 --> 00:33:11,549
Waiting for the perfect...

465
00:33:23,507 --> 00:33:25,549
And now our watch begins.

466
00:33:30,215 --> 00:33:31,965
Gilly? Little Sam?

467
00:33:33,841 --> 00:33:36,591
They'll be safe
down in the crypt.

468
00:33:38,299 --> 00:33:39,758
If you want to join them...

469
00:33:44,716 --> 00:33:45,883
To protect them.

470
00:33:45,965 --> 00:33:47,549
Everyone seems to forget
that I was

471
00:33:47,633 --> 00:33:49,066
the first man
to kill a White Walker.

472
00:33:49,090 --> 00:33:51,174
- I've killed Thenns.
- Thenn.

473
00:33:51,257 --> 00:33:52,716
I've saved Gilly
more than once.

474
00:33:52,799 --> 00:33:54,674
I stole a considerable
number of books

475
00:33:54,758 --> 00:33:55,924
from the Citadel library,

476
00:33:56,007 --> 00:33:58,466
survived
the Fist of the First Men.

477
00:33:58,549 --> 00:34:00,716
You need me out there.

478
00:34:00,799 --> 00:34:02,341
Well,
if that's what it's come to,

479
00:34:02,424 --> 00:34:04,924
- we really are fucked.
- Well, calling you "fucked"

480
00:34:05,007 --> 00:34:06,591
wouldn't be strictly accurate.

481
00:34:10,424 --> 00:34:12,049
Samwell Tarly.

482
00:34:12,132 --> 00:34:14,716
Slayer of White Walkers.

483
00:34:14,799 --> 00:34:16,466
Lover of Ladies.

484
00:34:17,924 --> 00:34:19,507
As if we needed any more signs

485
00:34:19,591 --> 00:34:20,674
the world was ending.

486
00:34:22,924 --> 00:34:24,591
Think back to where we started.

487
00:34:27,132 --> 00:34:30,591
Us, Grenn, Pyp.

488
00:34:32,132 --> 00:34:34,507
Now it's just us three.

489
00:34:34,591 --> 00:34:38,257
Last man left,
burn the rest of us.

490
00:34:53,674 --> 00:34:55,299
I wish Father were here.

491
00:34:57,924 --> 00:34:59,883
I would love to see
the look on his face

492
00:34:59,965 --> 00:35:01,591
when he realizes his two sons

493
00:35:01,674 --> 00:35:04,007
are about to die
defending Winterfell.

494
00:35:08,716 --> 00:35:10,633
That would be something to see.

495
00:35:16,841 --> 00:35:20,007
I remember the first time we were here,

496
00:35:20,090 --> 00:35:21,924
the first time
I saw this hall.

497
00:35:22,007 --> 00:35:22,924
Mm.

498
00:35:23,007 --> 00:35:24,549
You were a golden lion.

499
00:35:25,716 --> 00:35:28,424
I was a drunken whoremonger.

500
00:35:28,507 --> 00:35:29,799
It was all so simple.

501
00:35:31,007 --> 00:35:33,215
It wasn't so simple.

502
00:35:33,299 --> 00:35:34,758
I was sleeping with my sister

503
00:35:34,841 --> 00:35:37,466
and you had one friend
in the world

504
00:35:37,549 --> 00:35:39,049
who was sleeping
with his sister.

505
00:35:39,132 --> 00:35:41,382
I was speaking
in relative terms.

506
00:35:43,174 --> 00:35:45,841
- Do you miss it?
- Of course I miss it.

507
00:35:47,382 --> 00:35:49,466
Well,
my golden-lion days are done,

508
00:35:49,549 --> 00:35:52,215
but whoremongering
is still an option for you.

509
00:35:53,341 --> 00:35:54,382
It's not.

510
00:35:55,883 --> 00:35:58,758
Things would be easier
if it were.

511
00:36:01,633 --> 00:36:03,549
The perils of self-betterment.

512
00:36:09,049 --> 00:36:10,965
Oh!

513
00:36:11,049 --> 00:36:12,549
My lady.

514
00:36:12,633 --> 00:36:14,507
Oh, we didn't mean to interrupt.

515
00:36:14,591 --> 00:36:16,674
We were just looking for
somewhere warm to...

516
00:36:16,758 --> 00:36:18,549
To contemplate
your imminent death.

517
00:36:18,633 --> 00:36:20,466
You've come to the right place.

518
00:36:20,549 --> 00:36:22,965
You want some of this piss?
It's not bad.

519
00:36:23,049 --> 00:36:25,341
- It's not good either.
- Thank you, milord.

520
00:36:25,424 --> 00:36:27,341
I don't think that's wise.

521
00:36:27,424 --> 00:36:29,924
The battle
might start at any moment.

522
00:36:32,674 --> 00:36:33,799
Half cup.

523
00:36:35,883 --> 00:36:37,841
- And you?
- No, thank you.

524
00:36:37,924 --> 00:36:39,424
I should try
and get some sleep.

525
00:36:39,507 --> 00:36:41,090
You really think any of us

526
00:36:41,174 --> 00:36:42,591
are going to sleep tonight?

527
00:36:43,841 --> 00:36:45,049
Join us.

528
00:36:46,924 --> 00:36:48,174
All right.

529
00:36:48,257 --> 00:36:49,591
Just a bit.

530
00:36:56,049 --> 00:36:57,674
Well, what do we have here?

531
00:36:57,758 --> 00:36:59,049
Ser Davos, join us.

532
00:36:59,132 --> 00:37:00,215
No, none for me, thanks.

533
00:37:00,299 --> 00:37:01,674
Came here for this.

534
00:37:01,758 --> 00:37:04,132
I figured I could wait to die

535
00:37:04,215 --> 00:37:07,132
freezing my balls off
out there

536
00:37:07,215 --> 00:37:10,007
or wait to die
nice and warm in here.

537
00:37:12,965 --> 00:37:16,257
It could be our last night
in this world, you know.

538
00:37:17,466 --> 00:37:20,549
Yes, well,
I'm glad you're here.

539
00:37:20,633 --> 00:37:22,382
Here fighting with us.

540
00:37:22,466 --> 00:37:24,466
Glad you survived Eastwatch.

541
00:37:24,549 --> 00:37:26,174
Would you like a drink?

542
00:37:27,132 --> 00:37:28,174
Brought my own.

543
00:37:35,341 --> 00:37:37,341
They call you "King Killer."

544
00:37:38,341 --> 00:37:40,215
I'm sure someone does.

545
00:37:41,257 --> 00:37:43,341
They call me "Giantsbane."

546
00:37:44,674 --> 00:37:45,799
Want to know why?

547
00:37:56,341 --> 00:37:59,466
I killed a giant
when I was 10.

548
00:38:01,174 --> 00:38:04,841
Then I climbed right into bed
with his wife.

549
00:38:06,132 --> 00:38:09,633
When she woke up,
you know what she did?

550
00:38:12,924 --> 00:38:17,424
Suckled me at her teat
for three months.

551
00:38:17,507 --> 00:38:19,341
Thought I was her baby.

552
00:38:20,299 --> 00:38:22,549
That's how I got so strong.

553
00:38:24,215 --> 00:38:25,716
Giant's milk.

554
00:38:40,049 --> 00:38:41,215
Mm.

555
00:38:44,049 --> 00:38:45,633
Maybe I will have that drink.

556
00:39:24,591 --> 00:39:25,841
You never used to shut up.

557
00:39:25,924 --> 00:39:28,382
Now you're just sitting there
like a mute.

558
00:39:31,674 --> 00:39:32,965
Guess I've changed.

559
00:39:41,466 --> 00:39:43,758
What are you doing up here?

560
00:39:43,841 --> 00:39:45,716
What's it look like?

561
00:39:45,799 --> 00:39:48,633
No, I mean,
what are you doing up here?

562
00:39:51,132 --> 00:39:52,674
You joined the Brotherhood.

563
00:39:52,758 --> 00:39:54,382
You went beyond the Wall
with Jon.

564
00:39:54,466 --> 00:39:55,965
You're here now. Why?

565
00:39:57,924 --> 00:39:59,049
When was the last time

566
00:39:59,132 --> 00:40:01,341
you fought for anyone
but yourself?

567
00:40:04,049 --> 00:40:06,132
I fought for you, didn't I?

568
00:40:16,299 --> 00:40:18,382
Oh, for fuck's sake.

569
00:40:18,466 --> 00:40:20,299
May as well be
at a bloody wedding.

570
00:40:23,215 --> 00:40:24,674
My lady.

571
00:40:24,758 --> 00:40:26,841
It's good to see you again.

572
00:40:26,965 --> 00:40:29,299
I'm sorry we parted
the way we did.

573
00:40:30,507 --> 00:40:32,049
Was he on your list?

574
00:40:33,132 --> 00:40:34,341
For a little while.

575
00:40:35,424 --> 00:40:36,674
That's all right.

576
00:40:38,507 --> 00:40:41,466
The Lord of Light has brought us
together all the same.

577
00:40:43,591 --> 00:40:45,549
This is his moment.

578
00:40:45,633 --> 00:40:47,674
- When light...
- Thoros isn't here anymore,

579
00:40:47,758 --> 00:40:50,591
so I hope you're not
about to give a sermon.

580
00:40:50,674 --> 00:40:52,132
Because if you are,

581
00:40:52,215 --> 00:40:55,424
the Lord of Light's gonna wonder
why he brought you back 19 times

582
00:40:55,507 --> 00:40:57,007
just to watch you die
when I chuck you

583
00:40:57,090 --> 00:40:59,341
over this fucking wall.

584
00:41:12,716 --> 00:41:13,883
Where are you going?

585
00:41:15,424 --> 00:41:17,090
I'm not spending my final hours

586
00:41:17,174 --> 00:41:19,215
with you two
miserable old shits.

587
00:41:43,466 --> 00:41:45,049
That for me?

588
00:41:59,132 --> 00:42:00,758
This'll work.

589
00:42:04,132 --> 00:42:05,341
Last time you saw me,

590
00:42:05,424 --> 00:42:07,257
you wanted me
to come to Winterfell.

591
00:42:08,341 --> 00:42:09,716
Took the long road, but...

592
00:42:11,466 --> 00:42:13,549
What did the Red Woman
want with you?

593
00:42:18,007 --> 00:42:21,507
She wanted my blood
for some kind of spell.

594
00:42:21,591 --> 00:42:23,090
Why your blood?

595
00:42:24,716 --> 00:42:26,382
I'm Robert Baratheon's bastard.

596
00:42:28,007 --> 00:42:30,090
I didn't know
until she told me.

597
00:42:30,174 --> 00:42:32,382
Then she tied me up,
stripped me down,

598
00:42:32,466 --> 00:42:33,841
put leeches all over me.

599
00:42:37,215 --> 00:42:39,174
Was that your first time?

600
00:42:39,257 --> 00:42:41,965
No, yeah, I've never had leeches
put all over my cock.

601
00:42:42,049 --> 00:42:44,007
Your first time with a woman.

602
00:42:44,090 --> 00:42:45,883
What?

603
00:42:45,965 --> 00:42:48,424
I... I didn't...
I wasn't with her.

604
00:42:48,507 --> 00:42:51,883
Were you with other girls
before that in King's Landing?

605
00:42:51,965 --> 00:42:53,633
Or after?

606
00:42:57,758 --> 00:42:59,591
You don't remember?

607
00:43:01,299 --> 00:43:03,257
- Yes, I was.
- One?

608
00:43:04,466 --> 00:43:05,716
Two?

609
00:43:05,799 --> 00:43:08,341
- Twenty?
- Well, I didn't keep count.

610
00:43:10,299 --> 00:43:11,299
Yes, you did.

611
00:43:14,633 --> 00:43:16,174
Three.

612
00:43:21,841 --> 00:43:24,341
We're probably
going to die soon.

613
00:43:26,965 --> 00:43:29,674
I want to know what it's like
before that happens.

614
00:43:35,965 --> 00:43:37,382
Arya, I...

615
00:44:13,507 --> 00:44:15,674
I'm not the Red Woman.

616
00:44:15,758 --> 00:44:17,424
Take your own bloody pants off.

617
00:44:42,215 --> 00:44:44,424
It's strange, isn't it?

618
00:44:46,924 --> 00:44:50,132
Almost everyone here's
fought the Starks

619
00:44:50,215 --> 00:44:52,341
at one time or another.

620
00:44:52,424 --> 00:44:56,965
And here we are in their castle,
ready to defend it.

621
00:44:57,049 --> 00:44:58,257
Together.

622
00:45:01,090 --> 00:45:03,090
At least we'll die with honor.

623
00:45:08,924 --> 00:45:10,507
I think we might live.

624
00:45:14,174 --> 00:45:15,758
I... I do.

625
00:45:17,382 --> 00:45:20,132
How many battles
have we survived between us?

626
00:45:21,466 --> 00:45:22,799
Ser Davos Seaworth.

627
00:45:23,758 --> 00:45:25,799
Survivor of both the Blackwater

628
00:45:25,883 --> 00:45:27,965
and the Battle of the Bastards.

629
00:45:28,049 --> 00:45:29,174
All without a shred

630
00:45:29,257 --> 00:45:31,090
- of combat ability.
- Mm.

631
00:45:31,174 --> 00:45:35,132
Ser Jaime Lannister, fabled hero
of the Siege of Pyke.

632
00:45:35,215 --> 00:45:37,883
Fabled loser of the Battle
of Whispering Wood.

633
00:45:37,965 --> 00:45:38,965
Hear, hear!

634
00:45:40,341 --> 00:45:41,965
Ser Brienne of Tarth.

635
00:45:42,049 --> 00:45:44,174
Defeated the Hound in...

636
00:45:45,132 --> 00:45:47,382
Pardon me, Lady Brienne.

637
00:45:47,466 --> 00:45:49,507
She's not a ser?

638
00:45:49,591 --> 00:45:50,674
You're not a knight?

639
00:45:52,132 --> 00:45:53,507
Women can't be knights.

640
00:45:53,591 --> 00:45:55,591
- Why not?
- Tradition.

641
00:45:55,674 --> 00:45:56,758
Fuck tradition.

642
00:45:58,007 --> 00:46:00,633
I don't even want
to be a knight.

643
00:46:04,257 --> 00:46:05,341
I'm no king.

644
00:46:05,424 --> 00:46:07,716
But if I were,

645
00:46:07,799 --> 00:46:10,549
I'd knight you 10 times over.

646
00:46:12,549 --> 00:46:14,174
You don't need a king.

647
00:46:15,341 --> 00:46:18,299
Any knight
can make another knight.

648
00:46:23,257 --> 00:46:24,299
I'll prove it.

649
00:46:27,466 --> 00:46:30,007
Kneel, Lady Brienne.

650
00:46:33,883 --> 00:46:36,007
Do you want to be a knight or not?

651
00:46:40,799 --> 00:46:41,799
Kneel.

652
00:47:35,466 --> 00:47:37,090
In the name of the Warrior,

653
00:47:38,049 --> 00:47:39,758
I charge you to be brave.

654
00:47:42,049 --> 00:47:44,090
In the name of the Father,

655
00:47:45,549 --> 00:47:47,382
I charge you to be just.

656
00:47:50,466 --> 00:47:52,257
In the name of the Mother,

657
00:47:52,341 --> 00:47:55,591
I charge you
to defend the innocent.

658
00:48:04,466 --> 00:48:06,841
Arise, Brienne of Tarth...

659
00:48:08,299 --> 00:48:10,758
a knight of the Seven Kingdoms.

660
00:48:27,965 --> 00:48:29,758
Ser Brienne of Tarth!

661
00:48:31,132 --> 00:48:32,965
Knight of the Seven Kingdoms!

662
00:48:42,883 --> 00:48:44,883
We have all we need to win this war.

663
00:48:44,965 --> 00:48:47,466
I have trained my men,
women and children.

664
00:48:47,549 --> 00:48:49,424
I have fought before.
I can fight again.

665
00:48:49,507 --> 00:48:52,674
Please, listen to me.
You're the future of our house.

666
00:48:52,758 --> 00:48:54,674
I don't need you to remind me of that.

667
00:48:54,758 --> 00:48:57,758
You'll be safer in the crypt.
These things we're fighting...

668
00:48:57,841 --> 00:48:59,382
I will not hide underground.

669
00:48:59,466 --> 00:49:01,257
I pledged to fight
for the North,

670
00:49:01,341 --> 00:49:03,924
- and I will fight.
- I'm meant to relieve you.

671
00:49:04,007 --> 00:49:05,883
- You got it?
- Yeah, I got it.

672
00:49:08,633 --> 00:49:10,965
Oh, I'm sorry,
I didn't mean to...

673
00:49:11,049 --> 00:49:12,132
It's all right.

674
00:49:13,466 --> 00:49:14,716
We're done here.

675
00:49:20,758 --> 00:49:22,674
I wish you good fortune, cousin.

676
00:49:24,591 --> 00:49:25,883
Thank you, my lady.

677
00:49:27,132 --> 00:49:28,424
- My lady.
- My lady.

678
00:49:33,299 --> 00:49:34,549
What have you got there?

679
00:49:36,215 --> 00:49:37,549
It's called Heartsbane.

680
00:49:38,883 --> 00:49:40,965
It's my family sword.

681
00:49:41,049 --> 00:49:42,549
You still have a family.

682
00:49:43,799 --> 00:49:46,549
Yes. And I'd love
to defend them with it.

683
00:49:48,591 --> 00:49:50,758
But I can't really
hold it upright.

684
00:49:53,215 --> 00:49:56,507
Your father,
he taught me how to be a man.

685
00:49:58,007 --> 00:49:59,507
How to do what's right.

686
00:50:01,716 --> 00:50:03,007
This is right.

687
00:50:07,215 --> 00:50:09,382
It's Valyrian steel.

688
00:50:11,049 --> 00:50:12,965
I'd be honored
if you'd take it.

689
00:50:26,215 --> 00:50:27,924
I'll wield it in his memory...

690
00:50:32,299 --> 00:50:34,591
to guard the realms of men.

691
00:50:37,257 --> 00:50:39,466
I'll see you when it's through.

692
00:50:51,299 --> 00:50:53,174
I hope we win.

693
00:51:01,841 --> 00:51:04,799
- We'd better get some rest.
- No, let's stay a bit longer.

694
00:51:04,883 --> 00:51:06,090
We're out of wine.

695
00:51:12,466 --> 00:51:13,799
How about a song?

696
00:51:15,341 --> 00:51:17,007
One of you must know one.

697
00:51:17,924 --> 00:51:19,215
Ser Davos?

698
00:51:19,299 --> 00:51:21,799
You'll pray for a quick death.

699
00:51:24,841 --> 00:51:26,132
Ser Brienne?

700
00:51:32,132 --> 00:51:33,132
Mm-mm.

701
00:51:33,174 --> 00:51:34,674
Mmm...

702
00:51:36,758 --> 00:51:41,883
? High in the halls
Of the kings who are gone ?

703
00:51:41,965 --> 00:51:46,424
? Jenny would dance
With her ghosts ?

704
00:51:46,507 --> 00:51:52,883
? The ones she had lost
And the ones she had found ?

705
00:51:52,965 --> 00:51:57,174
? And the ones
Who had loved her the most ?

706
00:51:58,424 --> 00:52:00,507
? The ones who'd been gone ?

707
00:52:00,591 --> 00:52:03,758
? For so very long ?

708
00:52:03,841 --> 00:52:08,215
? She couldn't remember
Their names ?

709
00:52:09,257 --> 00:52:11,257
? They spun her around ?

710
00:52:11,341 --> 00:52:14,591
? On the damp old stones ?

711
00:52:14,674 --> 00:52:19,716
? Spun away all her sorrow
And pain ?

712
00:52:19,799 --> 00:52:25,257
? And she never wanted
To leave ?

713
00:52:26,382 --> 00:52:31,466
? Never wanted to leave ?

714
00:52:31,549 --> 00:52:36,507
? Never wanted to leave ?

715
00:52:36,591 --> 00:52:41,090
? Never wanted to leave ?

716
00:52:42,341 --> 00:52:47,549
? Never wanted to leave ?

717
00:52:47,633 --> 00:52:53,507
? Never wanted to leave ?

718
00:53:36,758 --> 00:53:38,090
Who's that?

719
00:53:41,965 --> 00:53:43,299
Lyanna Stark.

720
00:53:51,507 --> 00:53:53,257
My brother Rhaegar...

721
00:53:56,382 --> 00:54:00,299
everyone told me
he was decent and kind.

722
00:54:00,382 --> 00:54:01,633
He liked to sing.

723
00:54:02,799 --> 00:54:04,924
Gave money to poor children.

724
00:54:07,758 --> 00:54:09,090
And he raped her.

725
00:54:10,633 --> 00:54:11,674
He didn't.

726
00:54:16,299 --> 00:54:17,299
He loved her.

727
00:54:23,841 --> 00:54:26,132
They were married in secret.

728
00:54:27,716 --> 00:54:29,424
After Rhaegar fell
on the Trident,

729
00:54:29,507 --> 00:54:30,507
she had a son.

730
00:54:32,549 --> 00:54:34,090
Robert would have murdered
the baby

731
00:54:34,174 --> 00:54:36,382
if he ever found out,
and Lyanna knew it.

732
00:54:38,132 --> 00:54:39,674
So the last thing she did...

733
00:54:41,174 --> 00:54:43,257
as she bled to death
on her birthing bed

734
00:54:43,341 --> 00:54:45,299
was give the boy
to her brother...

735
00:54:46,799 --> 00:54:48,174
Ned Stark...

736
00:54:50,007 --> 00:54:51,841
to raise as his bastard.

737
00:54:55,507 --> 00:54:56,716
My name...

738
00:54:59,132 --> 00:55:00,507
my real name...

739
00:55:03,883 --> 00:55:05,424
is Aegon Targaryen.

740
00:55:08,299 --> 00:55:10,424
- That's impossible.
- I wish it were.

741
00:55:12,174 --> 00:55:13,341
Who told you this?

742
00:55:14,424 --> 00:55:15,424
Bran.

743
00:55:16,549 --> 00:55:18,549
- He saw it.
- He saw it?

744
00:55:18,633 --> 00:55:21,215
And Samwell confirmed it.

745
00:55:21,299 --> 00:55:23,424
He read about their marriage
at the Citadel

746
00:55:23,507 --> 00:55:25,382
without even knowing
what it meant.

747
00:55:26,549 --> 00:55:29,257
A secret no one
in the world knew...

748
00:55:29,341 --> 00:55:32,424
except your brother
and your best friend.

749
00:55:33,716 --> 00:55:35,174
Doesn't seem strange to you?

750
00:55:37,883 --> 00:55:39,382
It's true, Dany.

751
00:55:41,049 --> 00:55:42,257
I know it is.

752
00:55:46,965 --> 00:55:49,007
If it were true,

753
00:55:49,090 --> 00:55:53,132
it would make you the last
male heir of House Targaryen.

754
00:55:58,257 --> 00:56:00,257
You'd have a claim
to the Iron Throne.

755
00:56:10,716 --> 00:56:11,799
Form up!

756
00:56:14,924 --> 00:56:16,883
Get yourselves back!

757
00:57:16,257 --> 00:57:22,257
? High in the halls
Of the kings who are gone ?

758
00:57:22,341 --> 00:57:27,716
? Jenny would dance
With her ghosts ?

759
00:57:27,799 --> 00:57:30,758
? The ones she had lost ?

760
00:57:30,841 --> 00:57:34,924
? And the ones she had found ?

761
00:57:35,007 --> 00:57:41,174
? And the ones
Who had loved her the most ?

762
00:57:43,049 --> 00:57:48,758
? The ones who'd been gone
For so very long ?

763
00:57:48,841 --> 00:57:53,924
? She couldn't remember
Their names ?

764
00:57:54,007 --> 00:58:00,466
? They spun her around
On the damp old stones ?

765
00:58:00,549 --> 00:58:05,674
? Spun away all her sorrow
And pain ?

766
00:58:05,758 --> 00:58:11,758
? And she never wanted
To leave ?

767
00:58:11,841 --> 00:58:17,549
? Never wanted to leave ?

768
00:58:17,633 --> 00:58:23,382
? Never wanted to leave ?

769
00:58:23,466 --> 00:58:28,215
? Never wanted to leave ?

770
00:58:37,591 --> 00:58:39,758
The most
heroic thing we can do now

771
00:58:40,466 --> 00:58:42,257
is look the truth in the face.

772
00:58:50,924 --> 00:58:52,382
The Night King is coming.

773
00:58:58,257 --> 00:58:59,633
The dead are already here.

774
00:59:01,466 --> 00:59:03,215
Stand your ground!

775
00:59:10,424 --> 00:59:12,007
When I was a child,

776
00:59:12,090 --> 00:59:14,007
my brother would tell me
a bedtime story

777
00:59:14,090 --> 00:59:16,215
about the man
who murdered our father

778
00:59:16,299 --> 00:59:19,215
and watched as his blood
poured onto the floor.

779
00:59:19,424 --> 00:59:21,382
He told me other stories
about all the things

780
00:59:21,466 --> 00:59:22,883
we would do to that man

781
00:59:23,299 --> 00:59:25,341
once we took back
the Seven Kingdoms.

782
00:59:30,382 --> 00:59:32,257
When Jaime
shows up to Winterfell,

783
00:59:32,341 --> 00:59:35,174
it's very difficult
for almost anybody

784
00:59:35,257 --> 00:59:36,965
to know how to feel about it.

785
00:59:37,049 --> 00:59:38,965
On the one hand,
Dany looks at him

786
00:59:39,049 --> 00:59:41,174
as the person
who murdered her father,

787
00:59:41,257 --> 00:59:42,758
and even if
she has come to terms

788
00:59:42,841 --> 00:59:45,716
with who her father was
and what her father really was,

789
00:59:46,090 --> 00:59:49,132
it probably
doesn't entirely erase the sting

790
00:59:49,215 --> 00:59:52,716
of her father's murderer
showing up on her doorstep.

791
00:59:53,007 --> 00:59:55,549
Your sister pledged
to send her army north.

792
00:59:56,090 --> 00:59:57,341
I don't see an army.

793
00:59:58,424 --> 01:00:01,049
She never had any intention
of sending her army north.

794
01:00:02,174 --> 01:00:04,507
Tyrion has made
a number of mistakes now,

795
01:00:04,591 --> 01:00:06,674
and Dany's really
at the end of her patience.

796
01:00:06,758 --> 01:00:10,174
Because she has a lot of
fondness and respect for Tyrion,

797
01:00:10,257 --> 01:00:13,132
but many of his plans
have really gone awry.

798
01:00:13,549 --> 01:00:16,507
And now Jaime Lannister's here,
but not with the Lannister army.

799
01:00:16,883 --> 01:00:19,382
- Your Grace, I know my brother...
- Like you knew your sister?

800
01:00:20,049 --> 01:00:23,382
Tyrion can't really fight back
because he knows she's right.

801
01:00:23,466 --> 01:00:25,924
I mean, he really did
make a grievous mistake.

802
01:00:26,007 --> 01:00:28,174
If Tyrion has a flaw,

803
01:00:28,716 --> 01:00:31,424
he's a very clever man,
but sometimes clever people

804
01:00:32,090 --> 01:00:33,841
overestimate
their own cleverness.

805
01:00:35,299 --> 01:00:37,191
You don't
know me well, Your Grace.

806
01:00:37,215 --> 01:00:38,382
But I know Ser Jaime.

807
01:00:39,299 --> 01:00:40,341
He is a man of honor.

808
01:00:40,716 --> 01:00:44,132
For Brienne, I think
she's in love with someone

809
01:00:44,215 --> 01:00:45,799
who doesn't realize that she is

810
01:00:45,883 --> 01:00:49,215
because that kind of experience
hasn't been a part of her life.

811
01:00:49,591 --> 01:00:53,174
She's feeling things that
she can't really process

812
01:00:53,257 --> 01:00:54,657
because she never grew up
in a world

813
01:00:54,716 --> 01:00:56,299
where those things
were an option.

814
01:00:56,382 --> 01:00:58,299
She's so used
to Jaime taunting her

815
01:00:58,382 --> 01:01:01,299
and being the kind of
nasty Jaime Lannister of old

816
01:01:01,382 --> 01:01:03,299
that she is just
suspicious at first

817
01:01:03,382 --> 01:01:04,466
that he's playing her,

818
01:01:04,549 --> 01:01:06,716
and that he's gonna reveal
his true intent.

819
01:01:07,049 --> 01:01:08,674
I'm not the fighter
I used to be,

820
01:01:08,965 --> 01:01:11,633
but I'd be honored
to serve under your command,

821
01:01:11,716 --> 01:01:12,716
if you'll have me.

822
01:01:12,799 --> 01:01:15,215
He really believes in her
as a soldier,

823
01:01:15,299 --> 01:01:16,734
and he wants to
be there next to her.

824
01:01:16,758 --> 01:01:20,090
So I think she's really shocked
by his sincerity.

825
01:01:24,466 --> 01:01:26,924
Lady Sansa, I was hoping
we could speak alone.

826
01:01:29,591 --> 01:01:32,758
Dany comes to Sansa
with a bit of an olive branch,

827
01:01:32,841 --> 01:01:36,007
trying to find a way inside
that kind of cool exterior

828
01:01:36,090 --> 01:01:37,090
that Sansa presents.

829
01:01:37,382 --> 01:01:39,758
And one commonality between them
is they both love Jon.

830
01:01:39,841 --> 01:01:42,549
Dany's his lover
and Sansa's his sister.

831
01:01:42,633 --> 01:01:44,716
It's very much coming at it
from the point of view

832
01:01:44,799 --> 01:01:47,633
of a monarch trying
to make peace with her subject,

833
01:01:47,716 --> 01:01:49,299
and Sansa's not quite willing

834
01:01:49,382 --> 01:01:51,215
to accept Dany
as her monarch yet.

835
01:01:51,299 --> 01:01:53,341
She's suspicious of people
for a reason.

836
01:01:53,424 --> 01:01:54,633
What about the North?

837
01:01:55,090 --> 01:01:56,758
It was taken from us.

838
01:01:57,132 --> 01:01:58,341
We took it back.

839
01:01:58,591 --> 01:02:01,507
And we said we'd never bow
to anyone else again.

840
01:02:02,215 --> 01:02:03,299
What about the North?

841
01:02:03,799 --> 01:02:05,883
She's had
too many hard experiences

842
01:02:05,965 --> 01:02:07,549
not to be suspicious of people.

843
01:02:07,965 --> 01:02:10,507
And she sees Dany
as possibly a tyrant,

844
01:02:10,591 --> 01:02:12,633
as somebody who
has a lot of power

845
01:02:12,716 --> 01:02:14,799
and is seeking to get even more.

846
01:02:18,174 --> 01:02:19,174
They're coming.

847
01:02:19,549 --> 01:02:21,799
You can't beat them
in a straight fight.

848
01:02:22,507 --> 01:02:23,787
So what can we do?

849
01:02:23,841 --> 01:02:25,859
In the war castle scene,
there's a lot going on

850
01:02:25,883 --> 01:02:26,716
under the surface.

851
01:02:26,799 --> 01:02:28,799
The most important thing
about that scene

852
01:02:28,883 --> 01:02:31,466
is understanding
the lay of the land

853
01:02:31,549 --> 01:02:34,215
and understanding
what their intentions are,

854
01:02:34,299 --> 01:02:36,132
what their plans are,

855
01:02:36,341 --> 01:02:38,132
what their expectations are,

856
01:02:38,215 --> 01:02:40,090
so we know
what we're looking at.

857
01:02:40,174 --> 01:02:42,841
The Night King made them all.
They follow his command.

858
01:02:44,341 --> 01:02:45,507
If he falls...

859
01:02:47,466 --> 01:02:49,007
getting to him
may be our best chance.

860
01:02:49,090 --> 01:02:52,257
Things may not go
entirely according to plan,

861
01:02:52,341 --> 01:02:53,924
so we thought
it was very important

862
01:02:54,007 --> 01:02:57,799
for people to know what everyone
in the room expected to happen,

863
01:02:57,883 --> 01:03:00,257
was worried would happen,
hoped would happen.

864
01:03:00,591 --> 01:03:03,341
In addition to that, there are
a lot of human moments.

865
01:03:03,507 --> 01:03:05,382
We'll put you in the crypt,
where it's safest.

866
01:03:05,466 --> 01:03:07,426
No. I'll wait
for him in the Godswood.

867
01:03:07,507 --> 01:03:09,090
We're not leaving you alone
out there.

868
01:03:09,174 --> 01:03:10,674
He won't be. I'll stay with him.

869
01:03:10,841 --> 01:03:14,591
One thing that was definitely
going on was how Theon felt

870
01:03:14,674 --> 01:03:18,549
after returning to Winterfell
and how he's using this battle

871
01:03:18,633 --> 01:03:20,841
as an attempt to try
to make good

872
01:03:20,924 --> 01:03:22,507
to the extent
that that's possible

873
01:03:22,591 --> 01:03:24,758
on the horrible mistakes
that he made.

874
01:03:25,215 --> 01:03:29,507
I took this castle from you.
Let me defend you now.

875
01:03:35,841 --> 01:03:37,233
You're not a knight?

876
01:03:37,257 --> 01:03:38,424
Women can't be knights.

877
01:03:38,507 --> 01:03:40,257
- Why not?
- Tradition.

878
01:03:40,716 --> 01:03:43,424
Any knight can make
another knight.

879
01:03:45,174 --> 01:03:47,549
Kneel, Lady Brienne.

880
01:03:47,758 --> 01:03:51,257
Brienne has been more knightly
than any of the knights

881
01:03:51,341 --> 01:03:52,341
I think we've seen.

882
01:03:52,507 --> 01:03:55,132
I mean, she's a paragon
of strength and honor

883
01:03:55,341 --> 01:03:57,174
and being true to your word.

884
01:03:57,382 --> 01:04:00,716
When Jaime knights her, it's
a general kind of validation

885
01:04:00,799 --> 01:04:02,965
she's wanted her whole life,
but even more importantly,

886
01:04:03,049 --> 01:04:05,591
it's the acceptance
and validation of Jaime,

887
01:04:05,799 --> 01:04:09,591
who she obviously
has feelings towards

888
01:04:09,674 --> 01:04:12,382
that she's never really
come to terms with

889
01:04:12,466 --> 01:04:13,924
or even allowed to bubble

890
01:04:14,007 --> 01:04:15,674
to the surface
of her consciousness,

891
01:04:15,758 --> 01:04:16,998
but they're there all the same,

892
01:04:17,049 --> 01:04:19,507
and we can see all
of those things swirling.

893
01:04:19,591 --> 01:04:22,341
Ser Brienne of Tarth.

894
01:04:22,424 --> 01:04:24,049
Knight of the Seven Kingdoms.

895
01:04:33,049 --> 01:04:34,859
For us, what was interesting
about this episode

896
01:04:34,883 --> 01:04:36,758
was always that it's
our last night together,

897
01:04:36,841 --> 01:04:39,341
and everyone I think, would face
the end in different ways.

898
01:04:39,674 --> 01:04:41,424
We're probably
going to die soon.

899
01:04:41,924 --> 01:04:44,549
I want to know what it's like
before that happens.

900
01:04:46,090 --> 01:04:48,883
Some characters want
to make love for the first time

901
01:04:48,965 --> 01:04:50,549
because they've never done it
before.

902
01:04:50,799 --> 01:04:52,108
There are other characters
who are getting drunk

903
01:04:52,132 --> 01:04:54,883
and singing songs, and then
there are characters who are

904
01:04:55,132 --> 01:04:58,215
just trying to find some kind
of human solace together,

905
01:04:58,299 --> 01:04:59,633
like Sansa and Theon.

906
01:04:59,716 --> 01:05:01,674
Everyone faces it
in different ways,

907
01:05:01,758 --> 01:05:03,883
but they're all facing it,
and that's why this episode

908
01:05:03,965 --> 01:05:06,507
was so important to us because
it's all these characters

909
01:05:06,591 --> 01:05:07,859
that we've been following
for so long,

910
01:05:07,883 --> 01:05:09,799
and now they're all
facing a common enemy.

911
01:05:11,466 --> 01:05:12,799
How about a song?

912
01:05:14,466 --> 01:05:16,090
One of you must know one.

913
01:05:17,174 --> 01:05:19,549
? High in the halls ?

914
01:05:19,633 --> 01:05:22,215
? Of the kings who are gone ?

915
01:05:22,799 --> 01:05:26,215
? Jenny would dance
With her ghosts... ?

916
01:05:27,132 --> 01:05:29,257
Daniel's got
a really lovely voice,

917
01:05:29,965 --> 01:05:32,758
and we knew we wanted a song
in this episode.

918
01:05:32,841 --> 01:05:34,521
We've had a song in several
of the seasons.

919
01:05:34,549 --> 01:05:36,029
We haven't had an original
in a while,

920
01:05:36,090 --> 01:05:37,716
so this felt like the place
for it,

921
01:05:37,799 --> 01:05:38,941
and Daniel felt like the singer.

922
01:05:38,965 --> 01:05:41,132
? The ones who'd been gone ?

923
01:05:41,215 --> 01:05:43,965
? For so very long ?

924
01:05:44,549 --> 01:05:48,674
? She couldn't remember
The names ?

925
01:05:49,674 --> 01:05:54,549
? They spun her around
On the damp old stone ?

926
01:05:55,257 --> 01:05:59,341
? Spun away
All her sorrow and pain... ?

927
01:05:59,591 --> 01:06:02,841
The song, I believe,
is in George's books,

928
01:06:02,924 --> 01:06:04,965
um, at least the first verse
is in the books,

929
01:06:05,049 --> 01:06:06,549
and then,
we added some lyrics

930
01:06:06,633 --> 01:06:08,108
and Ramin came up
with the music for it.

931
01:06:08,132 --> 01:06:11,007
?...never wanted to leave ?

932
01:06:13,257 --> 01:06:17,674
? Never wanted to leave ?

933
01:06:18,382 --> 01:06:23,924
? Never wanted to leave ?
