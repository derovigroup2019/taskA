1
00:00:08,801 --> 00:00:10,217
Who would you say is the father?

2
00:00:10,635 --> 00:00:11,718
You.

3
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:15,259
I'm going to put a prince
in your belly.

4
00:00:17,551 --> 00:00:21,009
Our queen has a keen sense
of poetic justice.

5
00:00:21,092 --> 00:00:22,509
What would she do for the man

6
00:00:22,593 --> 00:00:24,718
who rids her
of her treasonous brothers?

7
00:00:25,593 --> 00:00:28,092
My name...
my real name...

8
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:30,217
is Aegon Targaryen.

9
00:00:30,885 --> 00:00:31,967
It's true, Dany.

10
00:00:32,468 --> 00:00:33,635
If it were true...

11
00:00:34,259 --> 00:00:35,739
you'd have a claim
to the Iron Throne.

12
00:00:36,426 --> 00:00:38,426
She doesn't like
your queen, does she?

13
00:00:38,843 --> 00:00:40,468
She's defending our family.

14
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:42,134
I'm her family, too.

15
00:00:43,676 --> 00:00:44,885
Don't forget that.

16
00:05:26,967 --> 00:05:30,217
We're here to say goodbye
to our brothers and sisters.

17
00:05:31,217 --> 00:05:33,551
To our fathers and mothers.

18
00:05:35,384 --> 00:05:36,509
To our friends.

19
00:05:38,134 --> 00:05:39,967
Our fellow men and women

20
00:05:40,051 --> 00:05:42,676
who set aside
their differences...

21
00:05:44,092 --> 00:05:45,593
to fight together...

22
00:05:47,259 --> 00:05:49,760
and die together

23
00:05:49,843 --> 00:05:51,801
so that others might live.

24
00:05:54,384 --> 00:05:56,718
Everyone in this world

25
00:05:56,801 --> 00:05:59,593
owes them a debt
that can never be repaid.

26
00:06:01,051 --> 00:06:03,967
It is our duty and our honor

27
00:06:04,051 --> 00:06:07,259
to keep them alive in memory...

28
00:06:08,426 --> 00:06:10,134
for those who come after us...

29
00:06:11,343 --> 00:06:13,259
and those
who come after them...

30
00:06:15,134 --> 00:06:18,134
for as long as men draw breath.

31
00:06:20,051 --> 00:06:23,551
They were the shields
that guarded the realms of men.

32
00:06:24,926 --> 00:06:27,760
And we shall never see
their like again.

33
00:08:59,259 --> 00:09:00,885
To your health.

34
00:09:27,885 --> 00:09:29,343
Have you seen Arya?

35
00:09:30,885 --> 00:09:32,718
You can still smell
the burning bodies,

36
00:09:32,801 --> 00:09:34,301
and that's
where your head is at.

37
00:09:34,384 --> 00:09:37,384
- I just want to thank her for...
- I'm sure you do.

38
00:09:37,468 --> 00:09:38,718
Look, it's not about that.

39
00:09:38,801 --> 00:09:40,551
Of course it's about that,
you twat.

40
00:09:40,635 --> 00:09:41,718
Why shouldn't it be?

41
00:09:41,801 --> 00:09:45,009
The dead are dead. You're not.

42
00:09:58,343 --> 00:09:59,843
Gendry.

43
00:10:02,259 --> 00:10:03,676
That's right, isn't it?

44
00:10:10,176 --> 00:10:11,259
Yes, Your Grace.

45
00:10:11,343 --> 00:10:13,551
You're Robert Baratheon's son.

46
00:10:19,926 --> 00:10:21,885
You are aware
he took my family's throne

47
00:10:21,967 --> 00:10:24,301
and tried to have me murdered?

48
00:10:24,384 --> 00:10:27,926
I didn't even know he was my
father until after he was dead.

49
00:10:28,009 --> 00:10:31,217
Yes, he's dead.

50
00:10:31,301 --> 00:10:32,885
His brothers are too.

51
00:10:34,343 --> 00:10:37,009
So who's Lord
of Storm's End now?

52
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:40,009
I don't know, Your Grace.

53
00:10:40,092 --> 00:10:41,926
Does anyone?

54
00:10:52,217 --> 00:10:54,593
I think you should be
Lord of Storm's End.

55
00:11:00,301 --> 00:11:01,551
I can't be. I'm a bastard.

56
00:11:01,635 --> 00:11:06,134
No, you are Lord
Gendry Baratheon of Storm's End,

57
00:11:06,217 --> 00:11:09,384
the lawful son
of Robert Baratheon.

58
00:11:09,468 --> 00:11:12,217
Because that
is what I have made you.

59
00:11:21,259 --> 00:11:25,176
To Lord Gendry Baratheon
of Storm's End.

60
00:11:25,259 --> 00:11:27,468
To Gendry!

61
00:11:27,551 --> 00:11:29,760
Lord Gendry!

62
00:11:29,843 --> 00:11:31,760
Gendry!

63
00:11:31,843 --> 00:11:34,259
- Gendry!
- Gendry!

64
00:11:36,176 --> 00:11:37,926
Lord Gendry!

65
00:11:39,259 --> 00:11:40,259
Gendry!

66
00:11:43,426 --> 00:11:45,217
That's easy, isn't it?

67
00:11:47,551 --> 00:11:50,676
- A fitting reward for a hero.
- Uh, hold on.

68
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:54,551
And a Lord of Storm's End
who will be forever loyal to you.

69
00:11:54,635 --> 00:11:56,468
- Come, my lord.
- See?

70
00:11:56,551 --> 00:11:58,926
You're not the only one
who's clever.

71
00:12:08,635 --> 00:12:11,593
I have to go down and get another barrel.

72
00:12:14,926 --> 00:12:17,801
We fought dead things
and lived to talk about it.

73
00:12:17,885 --> 00:12:21,092
If this isn't the time to drink,
when is?

74
00:12:31,384 --> 00:12:32,926
The last time I saw her,

75
00:12:33,009 --> 00:12:36,301
I told her I'd kill her
if I ever saw her again.

76
00:12:36,384 --> 00:12:39,134
- I'm sure you had your reasons.
- I did.

77
00:12:39,217 --> 00:12:41,676
- I do.
- So did you?

78
00:12:43,843 --> 00:12:45,760
Never got the chance.

79
00:12:45,843 --> 00:12:47,343
She did it to herself.

80
00:12:49,593 --> 00:12:51,509
Or her god did it to her.

81
00:12:54,051 --> 00:12:55,718
Lord of Light.

82
00:12:55,801 --> 00:13:00,092
We play his game for him,
we fight his war and win,

83
00:13:00,176 --> 00:13:01,801
and then

84
00:13:01,885 --> 00:13:03,176
he fucks off.

85
00:13:03,259 --> 00:13:06,635
No signs, no blessings.
Who knows what he wants?

86
00:13:08,134 --> 00:13:10,217
I don't imagine
thinking about that subject

87
00:13:10,301 --> 00:13:12,092
will leave you
any happier than before.

88
00:13:12,176 --> 00:13:14,343
And what if
I'm not trying to be happy?

89
00:13:16,676 --> 00:13:17,801
Then you're in luck.

90
00:13:20,301 --> 00:13:22,718
We may have defeated them,

91
00:13:22,801 --> 00:13:25,718
but we still have us
to contend with.

92
00:13:30,676 --> 00:13:32,760
Thank you. I feel much better.

93
00:13:46,384 --> 00:13:47,426
More ale!

94
00:13:50,009 --> 00:13:51,343
This is clever.

95
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:55,217
Even better than the saddle
I designed for you.

96
00:13:56,551 --> 00:13:58,843
It's the same as the one
Daeron Targaryen built

97
00:13:58,926 --> 00:14:02,593
for his crippled nephew
120 years ago.

98
00:14:02,676 --> 00:14:04,509
I liked that one.

99
00:14:04,593 --> 00:14:07,760
You know our history
better than anyone.

100
00:14:07,843 --> 00:14:10,967
That will be useful
as Lord of Winterfell.

101
00:14:11,051 --> 00:14:13,009
I'm not Lord of Winterfell.

102
00:14:13,092 --> 00:14:16,092
You're the only surviving
trueborn son of Ned Stark.

103
00:14:20,967 --> 00:14:22,551
You don't want it.

104
00:14:22,635 --> 00:14:25,051
I don't really want anymore.

105
00:14:27,092 --> 00:14:28,426
I envy you.

106
00:14:31,426 --> 00:14:33,259
You shouldn't envy me.

107
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:36,760
Mostly I live in the past.

108
00:14:42,134 --> 00:14:43,551
- All of it.
- Go on.

109
00:14:43,635 --> 00:14:46,217
- No, not in one go.
- Go on. I believe in you.

110
00:14:46,301 --> 00:14:48,343
We have to celebrate our victory.

111
00:14:48,426 --> 00:14:50,718
Vomiting is not celebrating.

112
00:14:50,801 --> 00:14:52,593
Yes, it is.

113
00:14:52,676 --> 00:14:53,967
Ah!

114
00:14:54,051 --> 00:14:55,551
To the Dragon Queen!

115
00:14:57,967 --> 00:15:01,092
To Arya Stark,
the hero of Winterfell!

116
00:15:04,676 --> 00:15:06,885
- Rah! Rah! Rah! Rah!
- Drink!

117
00:15:19,635 --> 00:15:21,468
I'm fine!

118
00:15:34,843 --> 00:15:35,843
Your turn.

119
00:15:35,926 --> 00:15:37,509
Um...

120
00:15:38,384 --> 00:15:41,509
You are an only child.

121
00:15:42,635 --> 00:15:44,259
- I told you I was.
- You didn't.

122
00:15:44,343 --> 00:15:47,176
- I did.
- I surmised it.

123
00:15:47,259 --> 00:15:48,801
Drink.

124
00:15:49,801 --> 00:15:51,051
Go again.

125
00:15:51,134 --> 00:15:52,468
Why does he get to go again?

126
00:15:52,551 --> 00:15:54,426
Because it's my game.

127
00:15:54,509 --> 00:15:58,134
You have danced
with Renly Baratheon.

128
00:16:00,176 --> 00:16:01,009
No.

129
00:16:01,092 --> 00:16:02,468
Drink.

130
00:16:03,593 --> 00:16:05,384
The other way around!

131
00:16:05,468 --> 00:16:07,676
I saw him riding that thing.

132
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:10,509
- We all did.
- No. No.

133
00:16:10,593 --> 00:16:13,843
I saw him riding that thing.

134
00:16:13,926 --> 00:16:15,926
- That's right, you did.
- I did.

135
00:16:16,009 --> 00:16:19,760
That's why we all agreed
to follow him.

136
00:16:19,843 --> 00:16:22,051
That's the kind of man he is.

137
00:16:23,801 --> 00:16:25,217
He's little...

138
00:16:26,217 --> 00:16:27,801
...but he's strong.

139
00:16:27,885 --> 00:16:30,760
Strong enough
to befriend an enemy

140
00:16:30,843 --> 00:16:32,092
and get murdered for it!

141
00:16:33,176 --> 00:16:35,468
Most people get bloody murdered,

142
00:16:35,551 --> 00:16:36,760
they stay that way.

143
00:16:36,843 --> 00:16:38,468
Not this one.

144
00:16:40,051 --> 00:16:42,259
Yeah,
I didn't have much say in that.

145
00:16:42,343 --> 00:16:45,384
Ah! He comes back
and keeps fighting.

146
00:16:45,468 --> 00:16:48,967
Here, north of the Wall,
and then back here again.

147
00:16:49,051 --> 00:16:52,509
He keeps fighting.
He keeps fighting.

148
00:16:52,593 --> 00:16:55,509
He climbed on a fucking dragon
and fought.

149
00:16:55,593 --> 00:16:58,176
What kind of person
climbs on a fucking dragon?

150
00:16:58,259 --> 00:17:01,509
A madman or a king!

151
00:17:16,092 --> 00:17:18,843
- Drink.
- Drink.

152
00:17:18,926 --> 00:17:19,926
Drink.

153
00:17:50,593 --> 00:17:51,676
Wrong!

154
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:53,843
Wrong, wrong, wrong! Drink!

155
00:17:55,967 --> 00:17:57,134
Mm!

156
00:17:57,217 --> 00:18:00,468
You were married. Before Sansa.

157
00:18:01,343 --> 00:18:02,635
Drink.

158
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:09,885
You're drinking wine,
but you prefer ale!

159
00:18:09,967 --> 00:18:10,967
No!

160
00:18:24,801 --> 00:18:25,843
You're a virgin.

161
00:18:31,384 --> 00:18:33,092
That's a statement
about the present.

162
00:18:33,176 --> 00:18:36,092
At no point in the past,
up until this very moment,

163
00:18:36,176 --> 00:18:38,176
have you slept with a man.

164
00:18:39,801 --> 00:18:40,843
Or a woman.

165
00:18:47,217 --> 00:18:49,009
I have to piss.

166
00:18:49,092 --> 00:18:53,092
We did it!
We faced those icy fucks.

167
00:18:53,176 --> 00:18:55,760
Looked right
into their blue eyes,

168
00:18:55,843 --> 00:18:57,217
and here we are.

169
00:18:58,676 --> 00:19:02,134
Now, which one of you cowards
shit in my pants?

170
00:19:05,801 --> 00:19:07,967
Please pardon me for a moment.

171
00:19:27,593 --> 00:19:29,009
Drink it!

172
00:19:50,426 --> 00:19:52,593
And after all that,

173
00:19:52,676 --> 00:19:56,217
this fucker comes north
and takes her from me.

174
00:19:56,301 --> 00:19:58,217
Just takes her, like that.

175
00:20:00,217 --> 00:20:01,843
I mean it, Clegane.

176
00:20:01,926 --> 00:20:03,509
My heart is broken.

177
00:20:03,593 --> 00:20:04,843
Don't touch me.

178
00:20:04,926 --> 00:20:06,259
You can touch me.

179
00:20:07,551 --> 00:20:09,593
I'm not afraid of wildlings.

180
00:20:09,676 --> 00:20:11,426
Maybe you should be.

181
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:17,051
Well, Clegane...

182
00:20:18,176 --> 00:20:20,676
it's time to drown our sorrows.

183
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:22,426
I'm not done with my drink.

184
00:20:23,551 --> 00:20:25,426
You saved the day.

185
00:20:25,509 --> 00:20:26,885
You owe me one.

186
00:20:26,967 --> 00:20:30,468
- Don't forget that.
- For the rest of my days.

187
00:20:31,885 --> 00:20:33,051
Are you ready now?

188
00:20:33,134 --> 00:20:35,259
This is my drink.

189
00:20:40,801 --> 00:20:42,509
All right!

190
00:20:50,259 --> 00:20:53,301
She could have made you happy,
for a little while.

191
00:20:56,259 --> 00:20:58,801
There's only one thing
that'll make me happy.

192
00:20:59,801 --> 00:21:00,718
And what's that?

193
00:21:00,801 --> 00:21:03,176
That's my fucking business.

194
00:21:07,885 --> 00:21:10,718
Used to be
you couldn't look at me.

195
00:21:10,801 --> 00:21:13,051
That was a long time ago.

196
00:21:13,134 --> 00:21:15,843
I've seen much worse than you
since then.

197
00:21:15,926 --> 00:21:17,885
Yes, I've heard.

198
00:21:17,967 --> 00:21:19,718
Heard you were broken in.

199
00:21:20,718 --> 00:21:22,343
Heard you were broken in rough.

200
00:21:23,468 --> 00:21:25,801
And he got what he deserved.

201
00:21:25,885 --> 00:21:27,217
I gave it to him.

202
00:21:28,593 --> 00:21:29,635
How?

203
00:21:30,926 --> 00:21:32,051
Hounds.

204
00:21:35,885 --> 00:21:37,551
You've changed, Little Bird.

205
00:21:44,009 --> 00:21:45,384
None of it would have happened

206
00:21:45,468 --> 00:21:47,301
if you'd left King's Landing
with me.

207
00:21:47,384 --> 00:21:50,384
No Littlefinger, no Ramsay...

208
00:21:52,009 --> 00:21:53,259
none of it.

209
00:22:01,635 --> 00:22:04,176
Without Littlefinger,
and Ramsay and the rest,

210
00:22:04,259 --> 00:22:06,760
I would have stayed
a Little Bird all my life.

211
00:22:28,259 --> 00:22:31,384
- Hey!
- Pour another one.

212
00:22:43,801 --> 00:22:44,967
Don't shoot.

213
00:22:48,009 --> 00:22:50,885
It's nighttime, it's freezing,
and everyone's celebrating.

214
00:22:50,967 --> 00:22:53,468
You should be celebrating
with them.

215
00:22:53,551 --> 00:22:54,926
I am celebrating.

216
00:22:56,801 --> 00:22:58,760
Yeah, I am too.

217
00:23:01,009 --> 00:23:02,926
I'm not Gendry Rivers anymore.

218
00:23:03,009 --> 00:23:06,384
I'm Gendry Baratheon,
Lord of Storm's End.

219
00:23:06,468 --> 00:23:08,801
By order of the queen.

220
00:23:10,509 --> 00:23:11,801
Congratulations.

221
00:23:15,092 --> 00:23:17,051
I don't know how to be
lord of anything.

222
00:23:17,134 --> 00:23:18,760
I hardly know
how to use a fork.

223
00:23:18,843 --> 00:23:20,760
All I know
is that you're beautiful,

224
00:23:20,843 --> 00:23:21,967
and I love you,

225
00:23:22,051 --> 00:23:23,885
and none of it
will be worth anything

226
00:23:23,967 --> 00:23:25,134
if you're not with me.

227
00:23:26,468 --> 00:23:27,468
So be with me.

228
00:23:31,967 --> 00:23:35,593
Be my wife.
Be the Lady of Storm's End.

229
00:23:57,676 --> 00:24:00,092
You'll be a wonderful lord,

230
00:24:00,176 --> 00:24:03,217
and any lady
would be lucky to have you.

231
00:24:04,593 --> 00:24:06,051
But I'm not a lady.

232
00:24:07,468 --> 00:24:08,843
I never have been.

233
00:24:11,176 --> 00:24:12,176
That's not me.

234
00:24:38,343 --> 00:24:39,718
You didn't drink.

235
00:24:42,551 --> 00:24:45,593
- I didn't drink?
- In the game.

236
00:24:45,676 --> 00:24:48,843
- I drank.
- In the game. This is Dornish.

237
00:24:51,718 --> 00:24:55,259
This is not the game.
This is only drinking.

238
00:24:56,301 --> 00:24:57,426
Suit yourself.

239
00:25:08,384 --> 00:25:10,760
You keep it
warm enough in here.

240
00:25:14,134 --> 00:25:17,134
It's the first thing I learnt
when I came to the North.

241
00:25:17,217 --> 00:25:18,593
Keep your fire going.

242
00:25:18,676 --> 00:25:21,009
Every time you leave the room,
put more wood on.

243
00:25:21,092 --> 00:25:23,718
That's very diligent.
Very responsible.

244
00:25:23,801 --> 00:25:25,676
- Piss off.
- You know the first thing

245
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:27,551
I learned in the North?

246
00:25:27,635 --> 00:25:29,718
I hate the fucking North.

247
00:25:30,885 --> 00:25:32,092
It grows on you.

248
00:25:33,801 --> 00:25:36,426
I don't want things
growing on me.

249
00:25:37,676 --> 00:25:41,009
How about Tormund Giantsbane?

250
00:25:41,092 --> 00:25:42,593
Has he grown on you?

251
00:25:44,259 --> 00:25:46,259
He was very sad when you left.

252
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:49,593
You sound quite jealous.

253
00:25:52,426 --> 00:25:53,926
I do, don't I?

254
00:25:58,967 --> 00:26:00,801
It's bloody hot in here.

255
00:26:10,593 --> 00:26:11,967
Oh, move aside.

256
00:26:17,635 --> 00:26:18,676
What are you doing?

257
00:26:19,676 --> 00:26:21,134
I'm taking your shirt off.

258
00:27:08,009 --> 00:27:10,343
I've never slept with
a knight before.

259
00:27:11,593 --> 00:27:14,301
I've never slept
with anyone before.

260
00:27:16,217 --> 00:27:18,926
Then you have to drink.
Those are the rules.

261
00:27:20,009 --> 00:27:21,384
I told you...

262
00:27:36,885 --> 00:27:38,384
Are you drunk?

263
00:27:43,051 --> 00:27:44,051
No.

264
00:27:49,051 --> 00:27:50,343
Only a little.

265
00:28:00,509 --> 00:28:02,217
I didn't know Ser Jorah well...

266
00:28:03,635 --> 00:28:04,885
but I know this.

267
00:28:06,593 --> 00:28:08,509
If he could have chosen
a way to die,

268
00:28:08,593 --> 00:28:10,593
it would have been
protecting you.

269
00:28:11,635 --> 00:28:12,635
He loved me.

270
00:28:15,593 --> 00:28:17,718
And I couldn't love him back.

271
00:28:19,801 --> 00:28:21,551
Not the way he wanted.

272
00:28:25,009 --> 00:28:26,635
Not the way I love you.

273
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:31,217
Is that all right?

274
00:29:10,509 --> 00:29:12,593
I wish you'd never told me.

275
00:29:13,843 --> 00:29:16,635
If I didn't know,
I'd be happy right now.

276
00:29:18,092 --> 00:29:19,301
I try to forget.

277
00:29:20,967 --> 00:29:22,343
Tonight I did for a while,

278
00:29:22,426 --> 00:29:25,217
and then I saw them
gathered around you.

279
00:29:26,509 --> 00:29:29,051
I saw the way
they looked at you.

280
00:29:30,134 --> 00:29:31,509
I know that look.

281
00:29:33,176 --> 00:29:36,676
So many people have looked at me
that way, but never here.

282
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:38,343
Never on this side of the sea.

283
00:29:39,801 --> 00:29:41,092
I told you I don't want it.

284
00:29:41,176 --> 00:29:43,718
It doesn't matter what you want.

285
00:29:43,801 --> 00:29:45,593
You didn't want to be
King in the North.

286
00:29:45,676 --> 00:29:48,259
What happens when they demand
you press your claim,

287
00:29:48,343 --> 00:29:49,843
and take what is mine?

288
00:29:53,301 --> 00:29:55,134
I'll refuse.

289
00:29:55,217 --> 00:29:57,760
You are my queen. I don't know
what else I can say.

290
00:29:57,843 --> 00:30:00,051
You can say nothing.

291
00:30:00,134 --> 00:30:01,593
To anyone, ever.

292
00:30:01,676 --> 00:30:03,676
Never tell them
who you really are.

293
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:06,176
Swear your brother
and Samwell Tarly to secrecy,

294
00:30:06,259 --> 00:30:07,468
and tell no one else.

295
00:30:07,551 --> 00:30:09,176
Or it will take on
a life of its own

296
00:30:09,259 --> 00:30:10,967
and you won't be able
to control it

297
00:30:11,051 --> 00:30:12,259
or what it does to people.

298
00:30:12,343 --> 00:30:14,843
No matter how many times
you bend the knee,

299
00:30:14,926 --> 00:30:16,885
no matter what you swear.

300
00:30:22,051 --> 00:30:25,509
I want it to be the way it was
between us.

301
00:30:34,718 --> 00:30:36,509
I have to tell Sansa and Arya.

302
00:30:36,593 --> 00:30:42,967
Sansa will want to see me gone
and you on the Iron Throne.

303
00:30:43,051 --> 00:30:44,718
She won't.

304
00:30:44,801 --> 00:30:47,843
She's not the girl
you grew up with.

305
00:30:47,926 --> 00:30:50,217
Not after what she's seen,

306
00:30:50,301 --> 00:30:52,926
not after
what they've done to her.

307
00:30:56,301 --> 00:30:58,176
I owe them the truth.

308
00:30:58,259 --> 00:31:01,134
Even if the truth destroys us?

309
00:31:01,217 --> 00:31:02,926
- It won't.
- It will.

310
00:31:05,468 --> 00:31:07,259
I've never begged
for anything...

311
00:31:08,509 --> 00:31:10,676
but I'm begging you.

312
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:13,760
Don't do this. Please.

313
00:31:20,384 --> 00:31:21,760
You are my queen.

314
00:31:23,343 --> 00:31:25,217
Nothing will change that.

315
00:31:28,134 --> 00:31:29,843
And they are my family.

316
00:31:31,801 --> 00:31:33,468
We can live together.

317
00:31:39,384 --> 00:31:40,384
We can.

318
00:31:42,551 --> 00:31:44,301
I've just told you how.

319
00:32:20,426 --> 00:32:22,301
Half are gone.

320
00:32:26,134 --> 00:32:27,635
The Northmen as well.

321
00:32:34,009 --> 00:32:37,176
And the Golden Company
has arrived in King's Landing,

322
00:32:37,259 --> 00:32:39,259
courtesy of the Greyjoy fleet.

323
00:32:39,343 --> 00:32:43,051
The balance has grown
distressingly even.

324
00:32:43,134 --> 00:32:45,926
When the people find out
what we have done for them,

325
00:32:46,009 --> 00:32:47,259
that we saved them...

326
00:32:47,343 --> 00:32:49,676
Cersei will make sure
they don't believe it.

327
00:32:51,676 --> 00:32:53,301
We will hit her hard.

328
00:32:53,384 --> 00:32:55,593
We will rip her out
root and stem.

329
00:32:57,051 --> 00:32:59,676
The objective here
is to remove Cersei

330
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:02,426
without destroying
King's Landing.

331
00:33:05,551 --> 00:33:09,384
Thankfully,
she's losing allies by the day.

332
00:33:09,468 --> 00:33:12,301
Yara Greyjoy has retaken
the Iron Islands

333
00:33:12,384 --> 00:33:13,676
in her queen's name.

334
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:16,426
The new Prince of Dorne
pledges his support.

335
00:33:16,509 --> 00:33:18,551
No matter how many lords
turn against her,

336
00:33:18,635 --> 00:33:20,426
as long as she sits
on the Iron Throne,

337
00:33:20,509 --> 00:33:23,217
she can call herself
Queen of the Seven Kingdoms.

338
00:33:25,551 --> 00:33:27,301
We need the capital.

339
00:33:27,384 --> 00:33:29,134
I watched the people
of King's Landing

340
00:33:29,217 --> 00:33:31,509
rebel against their king
when they were hungry,

341
00:33:31,593 --> 00:33:33,801
and that was before
winter began.

342
00:33:33,885 --> 00:33:37,426
Give them the opportunity
and they will cast Cersei aside.

343
00:33:39,134 --> 00:33:41,509
We'll surround the city.

344
00:33:41,593 --> 00:33:43,843
If the Iron Fleet
tries to ferry in more food,

345
00:33:43,926 --> 00:33:46,009
the dragons will destroy them.

346
00:33:46,092 --> 00:33:48,509
If the Lannisters
and the Golden Company attack,

347
00:33:48,593 --> 00:33:50,259
we'll defeat them in the field.

348
00:33:50,343 --> 00:33:54,009
Once the people see
that Cersei is our only enemy,

349
00:33:54,092 --> 00:33:56,092
her reign is over.

350
00:34:01,259 --> 00:34:02,718
All right.

351
00:34:02,801 --> 00:34:05,926
The men we have left are exhausted.

352
00:34:06,009 --> 00:34:07,217
Many of them are wounded.

353
00:34:07,301 --> 00:34:09,176
They'll fight better
if they have time

354
00:34:09,259 --> 00:34:10,635
to rest and recuperate.

355
00:34:11,926 --> 00:34:13,134
How long do you suggest?

356
00:34:14,301 --> 00:34:15,801
I can't say for certain,

357
00:34:15,885 --> 00:34:17,926
not without
talking to the officers.

358
00:34:21,301 --> 00:34:24,176
I came north
to fight alongside you

359
00:34:24,259 --> 00:34:26,801
at great cost
to my armies and myself.

360
00:34:28,051 --> 00:34:30,885
Now that the time has come
to reciprocate,

361
00:34:30,967 --> 00:34:32,760
you want to postpone.

362
00:34:32,843 --> 00:34:35,718
It's not just our people.
It's yours.

363
00:34:35,801 --> 00:34:37,426
You want to throw them
into a war

364
00:34:37,509 --> 00:34:39,051
they're not ready to fight?

365
00:34:39,134 --> 00:34:40,843
The longer I leave
my enemies alone,

366
00:34:40,926 --> 00:34:42,426
the stronger they become.

367
00:34:45,967 --> 00:34:49,509
The Northern forces
will honor their promises

368
00:34:49,593 --> 00:34:50,885
and their allegiance

369
00:34:50,967 --> 00:34:53,468
to the Queen
of the Seven Kingdoms.

370
00:34:58,843 --> 00:35:00,676
What you command, we will obey.

371
00:35:05,426 --> 00:35:07,009
So...

372
00:35:07,092 --> 00:35:10,009
if all are in agreement...

373
00:35:10,092 --> 00:35:12,926
Jon and Ser Davos
will ride down the Kingsroad

374
00:35:13,009 --> 00:35:14,384
with the Northern troops

375
00:35:14,468 --> 00:35:17,009
and the bulk of the remaining
Dothraki and Unsullied.

376
00:35:17,092 --> 00:35:19,426
A smaller group of us
will ride to White Harbor,

377
00:35:19,509 --> 00:35:21,426
and sail from there
to Dragonstone

378
00:35:21,509 --> 00:35:25,217
with our queen and her dragons
accompanying us from above.

379
00:35:25,301 --> 00:35:27,967
Ser Jaime has chosen
to remain here,

380
00:35:28,051 --> 00:35:30,343
as a guest
of the Lady of Winterfell.

381
00:35:33,384 --> 00:35:35,301
We have won the Great War.

382
00:35:36,301 --> 00:35:38,051
Now we will win the Last War.

383
00:35:39,343 --> 00:35:41,343
In all Seven Kingdoms,

384
00:35:41,426 --> 00:35:44,217
men will live
without fear and cruelty

385
00:35:45,301 --> 00:35:46,718
under their rightful queen.

386
00:36:00,176 --> 00:36:01,343
We need a word.

387
00:36:05,468 --> 00:36:08,426
You understand we'd all be dead
if not for her.

388
00:36:08,509 --> 00:36:10,801
We'd be corpses
marching down to King's Landing.

389
00:36:10,885 --> 00:36:12,360
Arya's the one
that killed the Night King.

390
00:36:12,384 --> 00:36:14,468
Her men gave their lives
defending Winterfell...

391
00:36:14,551 --> 00:36:16,134
And we will never forget them.

392
00:36:16,217 --> 00:36:18,152
That doesn't mean that I want
to kneel to someone who...

393
00:36:18,176 --> 00:36:20,843
I swore myself and the North
to her cause.

394
00:36:20,926 --> 00:36:22,468
I respect that.

395
00:36:25,092 --> 00:36:26,760
You respect it?

396
00:36:27,468 --> 00:36:29,217
We needed her.

397
00:36:30,593 --> 00:36:33,217
We needed her army, her dragons.

398
00:36:35,009 --> 00:36:36,801
You did the right thing.

399
00:36:36,885 --> 00:36:39,301
And we're doing the right thing
telling you

400
00:36:39,384 --> 00:36:40,926
we don't trust your queen.

401
00:36:42,843 --> 00:36:45,134
- You don't know her yet.
- I'll never know her.

402
00:36:45,217 --> 00:36:46,509
She's not one of us.

403
00:36:46,593 --> 00:36:48,509
If you only trust the people
you grew up with,

404
00:36:48,593 --> 00:36:49,926
you won't make many allies.

405
00:36:50,009 --> 00:36:51,551
That's all right.

406
00:36:51,635 --> 00:36:53,760
I don't need many allies.

407
00:36:53,843 --> 00:36:56,092
- Arya...
- We're family.

408
00:36:57,426 --> 00:36:58,635
The four of us.

409
00:36:59,718 --> 00:37:01,426
The last of the Starks.

410
00:37:05,468 --> 00:37:06,926
I've never been a Stark.

411
00:37:08,092 --> 00:37:09,676
You are.

412
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:12,760
You're just as much
Ned Stark's child as any of us.

413
00:37:12,843 --> 00:37:14,718
You're my brother.

414
00:37:14,801 --> 00:37:17,301
Not my half-brother
or my bastard brother.

415
00:37:18,134 --> 00:37:19,676
My brother.

416
00:37:27,217 --> 00:37:28,967
It's your choice.

417
00:37:36,134 --> 00:37:38,343
I need to tell you something.

418
00:37:39,843 --> 00:37:43,343
But you have to swear
you'll never tell another soul.

419
00:37:46,635 --> 00:37:47,967
What is it?

420
00:37:49,259 --> 00:37:52,301
You have to swear it,
before I tell you.

421
00:37:52,384 --> 00:37:53,967
How can I promise
to keep a secret

422
00:37:54,051 --> 00:37:55,593
if I don't even
know what it is?

423
00:37:55,676 --> 00:37:57,343
Because we're family.

424
00:38:02,426 --> 00:38:03,426
Swear it.

425
00:38:04,718 --> 00:38:06,134
I swear it.

426
00:38:10,801 --> 00:38:11,801
I swear it.

427
00:38:19,843 --> 00:38:21,134
Tell them.

428
00:38:31,676 --> 00:38:34,217
So she's going to stay here with you?

429
00:38:36,676 --> 00:38:39,885
She's sworn to protect
the Stark girls, so...

430
00:38:43,217 --> 00:38:44,676
Say something snide.

431
00:38:45,885 --> 00:38:46,885
I'm happy.

432
00:38:46,967 --> 00:38:48,718
I'm happy that you're happy.

433
00:38:51,635 --> 00:38:55,009
I'm happy that you'll finally
have to climb for it.

434
00:38:57,051 --> 00:39:00,343
Do you know how long I've waited
to tell tall-person jokes?

435
00:39:01,551 --> 00:39:03,843
To climbing mountains.

436
00:39:03,926 --> 00:39:05,384
To climbing mountains.

437
00:39:07,967 --> 00:39:10,967
- What's she like down there?
- What?

438
00:39:11,051 --> 00:39:13,009
That's not your concern.

439
00:39:13,092 --> 00:39:15,635
I haven't been with a woman
for years.

440
00:39:15,718 --> 00:39:17,217
- Give me a morsel.
- You're a dog.

441
00:39:17,301 --> 00:39:19,176
I am the Imp,
and I demand to know.

442
00:39:19,259 --> 00:39:21,051
I knew you were fucking her.

443
00:39:22,967 --> 00:39:24,885
A pair of tall, blond toffs.

444
00:39:24,967 --> 00:39:26,635
Must be like
looking in the mirror.

445
00:39:26,718 --> 00:39:28,551
Ser Bronn of the Blackwater.

446
00:39:30,176 --> 00:39:31,926
Where's your drink?

447
00:39:32,009 --> 00:39:34,134
What are you...
What are you doing up North?

448
00:39:34,217 --> 00:39:35,676
What are you doing with that?

449
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:37,301
Oh, this?

450
00:39:37,384 --> 00:39:38,426
This is for you.

451
00:39:39,926 --> 00:39:41,009
For both of you.

452
00:39:41,092 --> 00:39:43,176
You're supposed to be south.

453
00:39:43,259 --> 00:39:45,176
You boys are a pair
of gold-plated cunts.

454
00:39:45,259 --> 00:39:46,819
- Do you know that?
- That's a bit rude.

455
00:39:46,843 --> 00:39:49,051
Year after year,
I've shoveled Lannister shit,

456
00:39:49,134 --> 00:39:52,051
- and what do I have to show?
- You're a knight, thanks to me.

457
00:39:52,134 --> 00:39:53,777
Thanks to me.
And that title's worth as much

458
00:39:53,801 --> 00:39:56,009
as a blond hair
from your brother's ballsack.

459
00:39:56,092 --> 00:39:57,676
Power resides
where men believe...

460
00:39:57,760 --> 00:39:59,718
Shut your mouth.

461
00:39:59,801 --> 00:40:02,134
- I'm just trying...
- I've never hit a dwarf before,

462
00:40:02,217 --> 00:40:04,092
but say another word
and I will belt you.

463
00:40:04,176 --> 00:40:06,718
See, I don't believe
you'd do that, after all...

464
00:40:06,801 --> 00:40:08,551
You couldn't do it
on your best day,

465
00:40:08,635 --> 00:40:09,718
you one-handed fuck.

466
00:40:09,801 --> 00:40:11,384
And your best days
are long gone.

467
00:40:11,468 --> 00:40:12,967
You broke my nose!

468
00:40:13,051 --> 00:40:14,819
- I did not break your nose.
- How do you know?

469
00:40:14,843 --> 00:40:17,134
Because I've been breaking noses
since I was your size,

470
00:40:17,217 --> 00:40:20,134
and I know what it sounds like.
Now listen.

471
00:40:20,217 --> 00:40:22,801
Your sister
offered me Riverrun.

472
00:40:22,885 --> 00:40:24,384
Nice big castle, good lands,

473
00:40:24,468 --> 00:40:26,509
plenty of peasants
who do what they're told.

474
00:40:26,593 --> 00:40:29,259
- And you trust Cersei...
- I knew your sister was dead

475
00:40:29,343 --> 00:40:31,134
the second I saw those dragons.

476
00:40:31,217 --> 00:40:32,801
Now,
your army may be torn to shit,

477
00:40:32,885 --> 00:40:35,092
but I'd still bet
on your Dragon Queen to win.

478
00:40:35,176 --> 00:40:37,676
And it just so happens
I'm a betting man.

479
00:40:38,926 --> 00:40:41,843
If Cersei's dead,
she can't pay up.

480
00:40:44,176 --> 00:40:46,343
Mmm, that's good.
Of course, the odds change

481
00:40:46,426 --> 00:40:48,426
if the Dragon Queen's Hand
turns up dead.

482
00:40:48,509 --> 00:40:51,384
Maybe a few of her top generals
get picked off one by one.

483
00:40:51,468 --> 00:40:53,384
- All of a sudden...
- May I speak?

484
00:40:53,468 --> 00:40:56,134
Why not?
Only death will shut you up.

485
00:40:59,509 --> 00:41:02,343
We made a deal long ago.
Do you remember?

486
00:41:02,426 --> 00:41:03,593
If anyone offered me money

487
00:41:03,676 --> 00:41:05,926
to kill you,
you'd pay me double.

488
00:41:06,009 --> 00:41:07,468
What's double Riverrun?

489
00:41:08,509 --> 00:41:09,509
Highgarden.

490
00:41:11,676 --> 00:41:13,176
You could be Lord of the Reach.

491
00:41:13,259 --> 00:41:16,092
- Highgarden? Are you mad?
- It's better than being dead.

492
00:41:16,176 --> 00:41:17,384
He's not going to kill us.

493
00:41:17,468 --> 00:41:19,217
He wouldn't be
talking to us if...

494
00:41:22,217 --> 00:41:23,468
The way I see it,

495
00:41:23,551 --> 00:41:26,217
I only need one
of the Lannister brothers alive.

496
00:41:26,301 --> 00:41:28,426
Highgarden will never belong
to a cutthroat.

497
00:41:28,509 --> 00:41:30,635
No? Who were your ancestors,

498
00:41:30,718 --> 00:41:32,885
the ones
who made your family rich?

499
00:41:32,967 --> 00:41:34,551
Fancy lads in silk?

500
00:41:34,635 --> 00:41:36,301
They were fucking cutthroats.

501
00:41:36,384 --> 00:41:38,801
That's how all the great houses
started, isn't it?

502
00:41:38,885 --> 00:41:41,301
With a hard bastard
who was good at killing people.

503
00:41:41,384 --> 00:41:43,718
Kill a few hundred people,
they make you a lord.

504
00:41:43,801 --> 00:41:45,801
Kill a few thousand,
they make you king.

505
00:41:45,885 --> 00:41:50,301
And then all your cocksucking
grandsons can ruin the family

506
00:41:50,384 --> 00:41:51,926
with their cocksucking ways.

507
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:56,760
Highgarden.

508
00:41:58,551 --> 00:42:00,092
Give me your word.

509
00:42:01,843 --> 00:42:03,301
You have my word.

510
00:42:05,176 --> 00:42:08,551
None of this means a thing
until we take King's Landing.

511
00:42:09,676 --> 00:42:12,092
We ride south in the morning.

512
00:42:12,176 --> 00:42:13,343
We could use an officer

513
00:42:13,426 --> 00:42:15,676
with knowledge
of the city's defenses.

514
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:17,009
Oh, no.

515
00:42:17,092 --> 00:42:19,676
No, my fighting days are done.

516
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:22,801
But I still got a few
killing days left, you hear me?

517
00:42:22,885 --> 00:42:25,509
I'll come find you
when the war is done.

518
00:42:25,593 --> 00:42:27,885
Till then, don't die.

519
00:42:52,676 --> 00:42:54,801
For fuck's sake.

520
00:42:56,343 --> 00:42:57,426
On your own?

521
00:42:58,635 --> 00:43:00,134
Not anymore.

522
00:43:01,635 --> 00:43:03,259
I don't like crowds.

523
00:43:04,926 --> 00:43:05,967
Me neither.

524
00:43:07,176 --> 00:43:09,343
Why not? They all love you now.

525
00:43:09,426 --> 00:43:11,009
You're the big hero.

526
00:43:12,176 --> 00:43:13,760
Don't like heroes.

527
00:43:15,718 --> 00:43:19,176
It must have felt good sticking
a knife in that horned fucker.

528
00:43:20,468 --> 00:43:22,176
Felt better than dying.

529
00:43:25,635 --> 00:43:27,343
You're heading
to King's Landing?

530
00:43:28,635 --> 00:43:31,051
I have some
unfinished business.

531
00:43:32,384 --> 00:43:33,801
Me too.

532
00:43:39,885 --> 00:43:42,009
I don't plan on coming back.

533
00:43:44,384 --> 00:43:46,009
Neither do I.

534
00:43:47,635 --> 00:43:50,009
Gonna leave me to die again
if I get hurt?

535
00:43:52,343 --> 00:43:53,343
Probably.

536
00:44:37,551 --> 00:44:38,551
My lady.

537
00:44:42,801 --> 00:44:45,551
"My lord"
is the standard response.

538
00:44:47,967 --> 00:44:49,384
Why her?

539
00:44:53,426 --> 00:44:55,426
You know she loves your brother.

540
00:44:55,509 --> 00:44:57,635
That doesn't mean
she'll be a good queen.

541
00:44:58,843 --> 00:45:01,551
You seem determined
to dislike her.

542
00:45:03,009 --> 00:45:04,176
A good relationship

543
00:45:04,259 --> 00:45:05,652
between the Iron Throne
and the North

544
00:45:05,676 --> 00:45:07,426
has been the core
of every peaceful,

545
00:45:07,509 --> 00:45:09,092
prosperous reign
we've ever known.

546
00:45:09,176 --> 00:45:10,676
Jon will be
Warden of the North,

547
00:45:10,760 --> 00:45:12,760
so a good relationship
seems likely.

548
00:45:14,468 --> 00:45:17,676
I don't expect him to spend
much time here going forward.

549
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:19,760
Well,
I suppose that's up to him.

550
00:45:24,092 --> 00:45:25,468
Sansa, look at me.

551
00:45:31,217 --> 00:45:33,384
With Jon in the capital,

552
00:45:33,468 --> 00:45:36,134
you'll be the true power
in the North.

553
00:45:36,217 --> 00:45:38,009
I'd feel much better
about the future

554
00:45:38,092 --> 00:45:39,426
if I left here today believing

555
00:45:39,509 --> 00:45:41,092
that you and Daenerys
were allies.

556
00:45:41,176 --> 00:45:44,926
What are you worried about?
Jon's taking our army with him.

557
00:45:45,009 --> 00:45:46,676
Your queen
still has her dragons...

558
00:45:46,760 --> 00:45:47,926
She's your queen too.

559
00:45:54,967 --> 00:45:57,217
You don't have to be her friend.

560
00:45:57,301 --> 00:45:59,217
But why provoke her?

561
00:45:59,301 --> 00:46:01,551
How is that in the best interest
of your family,

562
00:46:01,635 --> 00:46:04,051
- or the North, or...?
- You're afraid of her.

563
00:46:06,509 --> 00:46:10,843
Every good ruler
needs to inspire a bit of fear.

564
00:46:13,426 --> 00:46:15,718
I don't want Jon
to go down there.

565
00:46:15,801 --> 00:46:19,468
The men in my family
don't do well in the capital.

566
00:46:19,551 --> 00:46:22,259
No, but as your brother
once told me,

567
00:46:22,343 --> 00:46:23,718
he's not a Stark.

568
00:46:29,301 --> 00:46:30,676
Are you all right?

569
00:46:37,176 --> 00:46:39,760
Her people love her,
you've seen that.

570
00:46:39,843 --> 00:46:42,176
You've seen
how they fight for her.

571
00:46:42,259 --> 00:46:45,426
She wants to make the world
a better place.

572
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:49,843
I believe in her.

573
00:47:04,718 --> 00:47:06,051
Tyrion.

574
00:47:08,885 --> 00:47:11,468
What if there's someone else?

575
00:47:11,551 --> 00:47:13,176
Someone better?

576
00:47:21,509 --> 00:47:23,551
You're not gonna
ride the dragon south?

577
00:47:27,259 --> 00:47:28,426
Just a horse.

578
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:30,926
Rhaegal needs to heal.

579
00:47:31,009 --> 00:47:32,718
He doesn't need me
weighing him down.

580
00:47:32,801 --> 00:47:36,134
You weigh as much
as two fleas fucking.

581
00:47:37,426 --> 00:47:39,092
I'm taking the Free Folk home.

582
00:47:40,092 --> 00:47:42,843
We've had enough of the south.

583
00:47:42,926 --> 00:47:44,967
The women down here
don't like me.

584
00:47:47,051 --> 00:47:49,217
This is the North, you know.

585
00:47:50,468 --> 00:47:52,885
And the Free Folk
are welcome to stay.

586
00:47:54,426 --> 00:47:56,092
It isn't home.

587
00:47:56,176 --> 00:47:57,635
We need room to wander.

588
00:47:57,718 --> 00:47:59,801
I'll take them
back through Castle Black

589
00:47:59,885 --> 00:48:02,343
as soon as
the winter storms pass.

590
00:48:02,426 --> 00:48:04,092
Back where we belong.

591
00:48:08,051 --> 00:48:10,384
It's where he belongs too.

592
00:48:10,468 --> 00:48:13,176
A direwolf has no place
in the south.

593
00:48:14,426 --> 00:48:16,801
Will you take him with you?

594
00:48:18,051 --> 00:48:20,009
He'll be happier up there.

595
00:48:21,051 --> 00:48:22,343
So would you.

596
00:48:24,343 --> 00:48:26,760
I wish I was going with you.

597
00:48:31,134 --> 00:48:32,426
This is farewell, then.

598
00:48:34,009 --> 00:48:35,676
You never know.

599
00:48:41,885 --> 00:48:44,134
You've got the North in you.

600
00:48:45,635 --> 00:48:47,092
The real North.

601
00:49:19,593 --> 00:49:22,760
Yes, well, the nights
have been getting longer

602
00:49:22,843 --> 00:49:25,426
and there wasn't that much
to do in Oldtown.

603
00:49:25,509 --> 00:49:28,134
There's only so many books
a person can read, so we...

604
00:49:28,217 --> 00:49:30,926
I'm sure he knows
how it happens, Sam.

605
00:49:34,217 --> 00:49:36,885
If it's a boy,
we want to name him Jon.

606
00:49:40,217 --> 00:49:41,718
I hope it's a girl.

607
00:50:00,551 --> 00:50:02,676
You're the best friend
I ever had.

608
00:50:05,134 --> 00:50:07,176
You too, Sam.

609
00:51:07,718 --> 00:51:10,009
Think of the past 20 years.

610
00:51:11,009 --> 00:51:13,926
The war, the murder, the misery.

611
00:51:14,009 --> 00:51:16,426
All of it because
Robert Baratheon loved someone

612
00:51:16,509 --> 00:51:18,426
who didn't love him back.

613
00:51:20,509 --> 00:51:21,676
How many others know?

614
00:51:23,468 --> 00:51:26,092
Including us? Eight.

615
00:51:26,176 --> 00:51:28,259
Well, then
it's not a secret anymore.

616
00:51:28,343 --> 00:51:30,134
It's information.

617
00:51:30,217 --> 00:51:33,551
If a handful of people know now,
hundreds will know soon.

618
00:51:33,635 --> 00:51:35,051
Then what happens?

619
00:51:35,134 --> 00:51:36,718
She loses the North.

620
00:51:36,801 --> 00:51:39,593
She loses the Vale,
Sansa will make sure of that.

621
00:51:39,676 --> 00:51:41,092
No, it's worse than that.

622
00:51:41,176 --> 00:51:43,926
He has the better claim
to the throne.

623
00:51:44,009 --> 00:51:46,217
He doesn't want the throne.

624
00:51:46,301 --> 00:51:48,718
I'm not sure it matters
what he wants.

625
00:51:49,926 --> 00:51:53,176
The fact is,
people are drawn to him.

626
00:51:53,259 --> 00:51:54,967
Wildlings, Northmen.

627
00:51:56,967 --> 00:51:58,217
He's a war hero.

628
00:52:02,676 --> 00:52:04,843
He loves our queen.

629
00:52:06,384 --> 00:52:07,676
And she loves him.

630
00:52:09,885 --> 00:52:12,301
If we marry them,
they could rule together.

631
00:52:13,343 --> 00:52:14,509
She's his aunt.

632
00:52:14,593 --> 00:52:15,985
That never stopped
a Targaryen before.

633
00:52:16,009 --> 00:52:17,718
No, but Jon grew up
in Winterfell.

634
00:52:17,801 --> 00:52:20,051
Is marrying your aunt
common in the North?

635
00:52:22,801 --> 00:52:24,468
You know our queen
better than I do.

636
00:52:24,551 --> 00:52:27,259
Do you think
she wants to share the throne?

637
00:52:27,343 --> 00:52:29,885
She does not like to have
her authority questioned.

638
00:52:29,967 --> 00:52:31,217
Something she has in common

639
00:52:31,301 --> 00:52:33,885
with every monarch
who ever lived.

640
00:52:33,967 --> 00:52:35,760
I worry about her state of mind.

641
00:52:35,843 --> 00:52:37,967
We are advisors to the queen.

642
00:52:38,051 --> 00:52:41,384
Worrying about her state of mind
is our job.

643
00:52:49,343 --> 00:52:51,384
We still have to take
King's Landing.

644
00:52:52,551 --> 00:52:55,134
Maybe Cersei will win
and kill us all.

645
00:52:55,217 --> 00:52:57,509
That would solve our problems.

646
00:55:01,051 --> 00:55:03,509
Get to the skiff. Now!

647
00:55:05,593 --> 00:55:07,051
Spears!

648
00:55:07,134 --> 00:55:09,092
They're coming round again!

649
00:55:17,718 --> 00:55:19,176
Go!

650
00:55:19,259 --> 00:55:20,468
Clear!

651
00:55:20,551 --> 00:55:22,426
Man your stations!

652
00:55:22,509 --> 00:55:24,176
No!

653
00:55:42,092 --> 00:55:44,676
- Go! Go!
- Clear!

654
00:56:20,384 --> 00:56:21,468
Missandei?

655
00:56:23,051 --> 00:56:24,301
Missandei!

656
00:56:30,384 --> 00:56:31,801
Missandei!

657
00:56:36,718 --> 00:56:38,718
Our message was well-received, then?

658
00:56:38,801 --> 00:56:42,092
Your people have
heard the Usurper is coming.

659
00:56:42,176 --> 00:56:44,676
They are grateful
for your protection

660
00:56:44,760 --> 00:56:47,134
within the walls
of the Red Keep.

661
00:56:49,384 --> 00:56:51,343
You're certain about the dragon?

662
00:56:51,426 --> 00:56:53,676
I saw it sink beneath the waves.

663
00:56:53,760 --> 00:56:56,009
That must have been glorious.

664
00:56:58,217 --> 00:57:00,343
The glory is yours, my queen.

665
00:57:01,843 --> 00:57:04,343
When the war is won,
the Lion shall rule the land,

666
00:57:04,426 --> 00:57:06,092
the Kraken shall rule the sea...

667
00:57:07,468 --> 00:57:10,676
and our child
shall one day rule them all.

668
00:57:27,509 --> 00:57:29,217
She's coming for you.

669
00:57:30,343 --> 00:57:31,551
Of course she is.

670
00:57:34,343 --> 00:57:36,051
Keep the gates open.

671
00:57:36,134 --> 00:57:38,760
If she wants to take the castle,
she'll have to murder

672
00:57:38,843 --> 00:57:41,343
thousands
of innocent people first.

673
00:57:47,426 --> 00:57:49,926
So much for
"the Breaker of Chains."

674
00:58:03,468 --> 00:58:05,926
We will storm the city, my queen.

675
00:58:06,009 --> 00:58:09,217
We will kill your enemies.
All of them.

676
00:58:09,301 --> 00:58:10,384
Your Grace.

677
00:58:11,967 --> 00:58:15,635
I promised you I would look you
in the eye and speak directly

678
00:58:15,718 --> 00:58:18,051
if I ever thought
you were making a mistake.

679
00:58:21,593 --> 00:58:24,343
This is a mistake.

680
00:58:26,885 --> 00:58:29,426
You saw my child
fall from the sky.

681
00:58:31,051 --> 00:58:33,051
They took Missandei.

682
00:58:33,134 --> 00:58:35,134
Cersei needs to be destroyed,

683
00:58:35,217 --> 00:58:39,426
but if we attack King's Landing
with Drogon and the Unsullied

684
00:58:39,509 --> 00:58:40,718
and the Dothraki,

685
00:58:40,801 --> 00:58:42,967
tens of thousands
of innocents will die.

686
00:58:43,051 --> 00:58:47,760
That is why Cersei is bringing
them into the Red Keep.

687
00:58:47,843 --> 00:58:51,509
These are the people
you came here to protect.

688
00:58:51,593 --> 00:58:53,217
I beg you, Your Grace.

689
00:58:53,301 --> 00:58:57,009
Do not destroy the city
you came to save.

690
00:58:57,092 --> 00:59:00,926
Do not become what you
have always struggled to defeat.

691
00:59:05,760 --> 00:59:08,801
Do you believe we're here
for a reason, Lord Varys?

692
00:59:12,259 --> 00:59:15,343
I'm here to free the world
from tyrants.

693
00:59:16,509 --> 00:59:17,967
That is my destiny...

694
00:59:19,301 --> 00:59:22,259
and I will serve it,
no matter the cost.

695
00:59:29,217 --> 00:59:32,051
It could be a fortnight before
Jon and the allied armies

696
00:59:32,134 --> 00:59:34,134
make it to King's Landing.

697
00:59:34,217 --> 00:59:37,051
In the meantime,
demand Cersei surrender.

698
00:59:37,134 --> 00:59:40,468
Offer her her life
in exchange for the throne.

699
00:59:42,009 --> 00:59:44,509
If there's a chance
to avoid the coming slaughter,

700
00:59:44,593 --> 00:59:47,009
we should make the effort.

701
00:59:47,092 --> 00:59:49,967
Speaking to Cersei
will not prevent a slaughter.

702
00:59:52,217 --> 00:59:53,801
But perhaps it's good
the people see

703
00:59:53,885 --> 00:59:57,885
that Daenerys Stormborn made
every effort to avoid bloodshed,

704
00:59:57,967 --> 01:00:00,301
and Cersei Lannister refused.

705
01:00:02,009 --> 01:00:03,426
They should know whom to blame

706
01:00:03,509 --> 01:00:05,635
when the sky
falls down upon them.

707
01:00:19,801 --> 01:00:22,384
I've served tyrants
most of my life.

708
01:00:23,384 --> 01:00:26,593
They all talk about destiny.

709
01:00:26,676 --> 01:00:29,926
She's a girl who walked
into a fire with three stones

710
01:00:30,009 --> 01:00:32,676
and walked out
with three dragons.

711
01:00:32,760 --> 01:00:35,509
How could she not
believe in destiny?

712
01:00:35,593 --> 01:00:37,468
Perhaps that's the problem.

713
01:00:37,551 --> 01:00:38,760
Her life has convinced her

714
01:00:38,843 --> 01:00:40,718
that she was sent here
to save us all.

715
01:00:40,801 --> 01:00:42,718
And how do you know she wasn't?

716
01:00:44,967 --> 01:00:46,885
Then there's the problem
of Jon Snow.

717
01:00:53,384 --> 01:00:56,176
Perhaps
it's actually a solution.

718
01:00:57,718 --> 01:00:59,134
You know them both.

719
01:00:59,217 --> 01:01:02,343
Tell me, who do you think
would make a better ruler?

720
01:01:07,635 --> 01:01:09,384
He doesn't want the throne.

721
01:01:09,468 --> 01:01:11,926
That's why he bent the knee.

722
01:01:12,009 --> 01:01:14,092
Have you considered
the best ruler

723
01:01:14,176 --> 01:01:16,593
might be someone
who doesn't want to rule?

724
01:01:16,676 --> 01:01:18,967
We're discussing treason.

725
01:01:19,051 --> 01:01:21,718
Don't pretend
you haven't thought about it.

726
01:01:21,801 --> 01:01:25,134
Of course I've thought about it.
Thoughts aren't treason.

727
01:01:27,217 --> 01:01:31,259
He's temperate and measured.
He's a man,

728
01:01:31,343 --> 01:01:34,092
which makes him more appealing
to the lords of Westeros,

729
01:01:34,176 --> 01:01:36,426
whose support
we are going to need.

730
01:01:36,509 --> 01:01:37,926
Joffrey was a man.

731
01:01:38,009 --> 01:01:40,259
I don't think a cock
is a true qualification,

732
01:01:40,343 --> 01:01:41,468
as I'm sure you'd agree.

733
01:01:41,551 --> 01:01:43,509
And he's the heir to the throne.

734
01:01:43,593 --> 01:01:47,593
Yes, because he's a man.
Cocks are important, I'm afraid.

735
01:01:50,468 --> 01:01:53,509
What about my earlier proposal?

736
01:01:53,593 --> 01:01:55,801
They could rule together
as king and queen.

737
01:01:57,426 --> 01:01:59,760
She's too strong for him.

738
01:01:59,843 --> 01:02:03,384
She'd bend him to her will,
as she already has.

739
01:02:03,468 --> 01:02:06,551
He could temper
her worst impulses.

740
01:02:06,635 --> 01:02:08,593
As you have?

741
01:02:11,676 --> 01:02:13,843
You're drinking quite a lot.

742
01:02:16,259 --> 01:02:19,885
A Targaryen father
and a Stark mother.

743
01:02:19,967 --> 01:02:22,885
Jon's the one man alive
who might actually be able

744
01:02:22,967 --> 01:02:24,843
to keep the North
in the Seven Kingdoms.

745
01:02:24,926 --> 01:02:26,566
How many kings and queens
have you served?

746
01:02:26,593 --> 01:02:27,967
Five? Six? I've lost count.

747
01:02:28,051 --> 01:02:29,902
- You've always known my reasons.
- At a certain point,

748
01:02:29,926 --> 01:02:31,551
you choose a person
you believe in,

749
01:02:31,635 --> 01:02:33,134
and you fight for that person.

750
01:02:33,217 --> 01:02:35,301
Even if you know it's a mistake?

751
01:02:37,134 --> 01:02:38,843
I believe in our queen.

752
01:02:41,384 --> 01:02:43,593
She'll make the right choice.

753
01:02:45,176 --> 01:02:48,051
With the help
of her loyal advisors.

754
01:02:51,801 --> 01:02:54,176
You know
where my loyalty stands.

755
01:02:54,259 --> 01:02:56,551
You know I will never
betray the realm.

756
01:02:56,635 --> 01:02:57,926
What is the realm?

757
01:02:58,009 --> 01:03:00,134
A vast continent,
home to millions of people,

758
01:03:00,217 --> 01:03:02,235
most of whom don't care
who sits on the Iron Throne.

759
01:03:02,259 --> 01:03:04,217
Millions of people,
many of whom will die

760
01:03:04,301 --> 01:03:06,967
if the wrong person
sits on that throne.

761
01:03:07,051 --> 01:03:08,259
We don't know their names,

762
01:03:08,343 --> 01:03:10,217
but they're just as real
as you and I.

763
01:03:10,301 --> 01:03:11,509
They deserve to live.

764
01:03:11,593 --> 01:03:13,509
They deserve
food for their children.

765
01:03:17,259 --> 01:03:21,551
I will act in their interest,
no matter the personal cost.

766
01:03:23,676 --> 01:03:26,343
So, what happens to her?

767
01:03:34,301 --> 01:03:35,509
Please.

768
01:03:37,801 --> 01:03:38,885
Don't.

769
01:03:43,551 --> 01:03:46,051
I've spoken
as honestly as I can.

770
01:03:47,551 --> 01:03:50,259
Each of us has a choice to make.

771
01:03:51,301 --> 01:03:54,259
I pray we choose wisely.

772
01:04:05,176 --> 01:04:07,009
I'm just about to start it.

773
01:04:07,092 --> 01:04:08,509
Good luck.

774
01:04:08,593 --> 01:04:10,509
Protect shell right up to the wall.

775
01:04:10,593 --> 01:04:12,235
All right,
I'll put another one on it.

776
01:04:12,259 --> 01:04:14,092
He's headed down to the cellar.

777
01:04:14,176 --> 01:04:16,217
I'll need a cart over here.

778
01:04:16,301 --> 01:04:17,509
That's it, thanks.

779
01:04:17,593 --> 01:04:19,176
Thank you.

780
01:04:19,259 --> 01:04:20,652
It's really heavy, mind you.

781
01:04:20,676 --> 01:04:21,926
We need some more water.

782
01:04:22,009 --> 01:04:23,593
Take it down there!

783
01:04:28,509 --> 01:04:30,926
...as are the rest
of her advisors.

784
01:04:33,259 --> 01:04:34,301
What happened?

785
01:04:39,926 --> 01:04:44,301
Euron Greyjoy ambushed
Queen Daenerys and her fleet.

786
01:04:44,384 --> 01:04:47,343
One of the dragons was killed,
several ships destroyed,

787
01:04:47,426 --> 01:04:49,593
Missandei captured.

788
01:04:51,468 --> 01:04:55,635
I always wanted to be there
when they execute your sister.

789
01:04:55,718 --> 01:04:58,426
Seems like
I won't get the chance.

790
01:06:05,176 --> 01:06:07,801
They're going to destroy
that city.

791
01:06:08,843 --> 01:06:10,343
You know they will.

792
01:06:10,426 --> 01:06:12,718
Have you ever run away from a fight?

793
01:06:14,676 --> 01:06:17,092
You're not like your sister.
You're not.

794
01:06:17,176 --> 01:06:19,301
You're better than she is.

795
01:06:19,384 --> 01:06:21,926
You're a good man
and you can't save her.

796
01:06:22,009 --> 01:06:23,926
You don't need to die with her.

797
01:06:24,009 --> 01:06:25,551
Stay here.

798
01:06:27,426 --> 01:06:28,760
Stay with me.

799
01:06:30,468 --> 01:06:32,426
Please.

800
01:06:33,509 --> 01:06:34,509
Stay.

801
01:06:41,176 --> 01:06:43,009
You think I'm a good man?

802
01:06:47,760 --> 01:06:50,468
I pushed a boy
out a tower window,

803
01:06:50,551 --> 01:06:52,635
crippled him for life

804
01:06:52,718 --> 01:06:53,718
for Cersei.

805
01:06:56,801 --> 01:06:59,760
I strangled my cousin
with my own hands

806
01:07:00,760 --> 01:07:02,885
just to get back to Cersei.

807
01:07:05,885 --> 01:07:07,217
I would have murdered

808
01:07:07,301 --> 01:07:11,509
every man, woman and child
in Riverrun

809
01:07:11,593 --> 01:07:12,718
for Cersei.

810
01:07:21,593 --> 01:07:23,426
She's hateful.

811
01:07:25,301 --> 01:07:26,551
And so am I.

812
01:10:01,635 --> 01:10:02,635
My lord.

813
01:10:05,926 --> 01:10:08,967
Queen Daenerys demands Cersei's
unconditional surrender

814
01:10:09,051 --> 01:10:11,760
and the immediate release
of Missandei of Naath.

815
01:10:13,426 --> 01:10:17,843
Queen Cersei demands Daenerys's
unconditional surrender.

816
01:10:17,926 --> 01:10:21,967
If she refuses, Missandei
of Naath will die here and now.

817
01:10:23,635 --> 01:10:24,635
Qyburn...

818
01:10:26,092 --> 01:10:27,885
you're a rational man.

819
01:10:27,967 --> 01:10:30,926
Or so I flatter myself,
my lord.

820
01:10:31,009 --> 01:10:32,468
We have a chance here,

821
01:10:33,718 --> 01:10:37,217
perhaps our last chance,
to avoid carnage.

822
01:10:37,301 --> 01:10:38,301
Yes.

823
01:10:40,051 --> 01:10:41,051
Help me.

824
01:10:42,217 --> 01:10:45,092
I don't want to see
this city burn.

825
01:10:45,176 --> 01:10:48,468
I don't want to hear the screams
of children burning alive.

826
01:10:50,468 --> 01:10:53,426
No, it is not a pleasant sound.

827
01:10:55,635 --> 01:10:57,801
I... I don't want to hear it.

828
01:10:58,801 --> 01:11:00,301
Help me save this city.

829
01:11:02,259 --> 01:11:04,926
My lord, I am only a mouthpiece
for our queen.

830
01:11:05,009 --> 01:11:06,718
Your queen.

831
01:11:06,801 --> 01:11:08,926
Cersei is
Queen of the Seven Kingdoms.

832
01:11:09,009 --> 01:11:10,134
You are her subject.

833
01:11:10,217 --> 01:11:12,259
Her reign is over.

834
01:11:12,343 --> 01:11:14,885
You understand this.
Help her understand it.

835
01:11:14,967 --> 01:11:17,509
We understand
nothing of the sort.

836
01:11:18,843 --> 01:11:21,384
Your queen's last dragon
is vulnerable.

837
01:11:21,468 --> 01:11:24,384
Your armies
are battle-weary and depleted,

838
01:11:24,468 --> 01:11:27,760
while ours have been reinforced
with the Golden Compan...

839
01:11:45,635 --> 01:11:47,801
Ready!

840
01:11:47,885 --> 01:11:48,926
Nock!

841
01:11:51,801 --> 01:11:53,009
Draw!

842
01:12:59,301 --> 01:13:02,134
I know you don't care
about your people.

843
01:13:04,092 --> 01:13:05,885
Why should you?

844
01:13:07,384 --> 01:13:10,967
They hate you and you hate them.

845
01:13:16,468 --> 01:13:18,926
But you're not a monster.

846
01:13:20,967 --> 01:13:22,176
I know this.

847
01:13:24,301 --> 01:13:27,134
I know this
because I've seen it.

848
01:13:31,009 --> 01:13:33,468
You've always
loved your children.

849
01:13:35,468 --> 01:13:36,967
More than yourself,

850
01:13:37,967 --> 01:13:39,426
more than Jaime...

851
01:13:42,217 --> 01:13:43,676
more than anything.

852
01:13:46,635 --> 01:13:48,301
I beg you.

853
01:13:50,509 --> 01:13:53,967
If not for yourself,
then for your child.

854
01:13:57,509 --> 01:14:00,051
Your reign is over,

855
01:14:00,134 --> 01:14:03,134
but that doesn't mean
your life has to end.

856
01:14:06,009 --> 01:14:08,885
It doesn't mean
your baby has to die.

857
01:14:56,718 --> 01:15:00,384
If you have any last words,
now is the time.

858
01:15:25,134 --> 01:15:26,426
Dracarys.

859
01:15:35,635 --> 01:15:37,259
No.
