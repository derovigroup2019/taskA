1
00:00:02,434 --> 00:00:03,993
Cersei's
followers will abandon her

2
00:00:04,017 --> 00:00:05,309
if they know the war is lost.

3
00:00:05,518 --> 00:00:06,726
Give them that chance.

4
00:00:07,934 --> 00:00:09,100
If the city surrenders,

5
00:00:09,184 --> 00:00:10,944
they will ring the bells
and raise the gates.

6
00:04:46,351 --> 00:04:47,892
I'll find you later.

7
00:04:50,601 --> 00:04:51,643
It's not safe.

8
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:56,809
Let me send some men with you.

9
00:05:00,809 --> 00:05:02,142
I'm going alone.

10
00:05:48,017 --> 00:05:50,059
In the name
of the one true queen,

11
00:05:50,142 --> 00:05:51,434
Daenerys Targaryen,

12
00:05:52,559 --> 00:05:54,226
I sentence you to die.

13
00:05:55,226 --> 00:05:56,559
Grey Worm!

14
00:06:03,601 --> 00:06:05,309
It's over.

15
00:06:05,392 --> 00:06:06,768
These men are prisoners.

16
00:06:06,850 --> 00:06:09,476
It is not over until the queen's
enemies are defeated.

17
00:06:09,559 --> 00:06:11,726
How much more defeated
do you want them to be?

18
00:06:11,809 --> 00:06:13,892
- They're on their knees.
- They are breathing.

19
00:06:15,059 --> 00:06:17,017
Look around you, friend. We won.

20
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:19,434
I obey my queen's commands,
not yours.

21
00:06:19,518 --> 00:06:21,809
And what are the queen's commands?

22
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:26,267
"Kill all who follow
Cersei Lannister."

23
00:06:27,184 --> 00:06:28,559
These are free men.

24
00:06:29,518 --> 00:06:31,601
They chose to fight for her.

25
00:06:34,267 --> 00:06:36,768
Easy, men. Easy! Easy.

26
00:06:46,726 --> 00:06:47,726
Jon.

27
00:06:50,392 --> 00:06:52,601
We should speak with the queen.

28
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:08,100
Hyah!

29
00:15:23,768 --> 00:15:24,850
Torgo Nudho.

30
00:18:06,768 --> 00:18:08,601
You freed your brother.

31
00:18:10,017 --> 00:18:11,768
You committed treason.

32
00:18:13,267 --> 00:18:15,601
I freed my brother.

33
00:18:18,351 --> 00:18:20,850
And you slaughtered a city.

34
00:20:14,892 --> 00:20:16,892
What are you doing here?

35
00:20:19,601 --> 00:20:22,476
Hey, what happened?

36
00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:24,309
I came to kill Cersei.

37
00:20:25,726 --> 00:20:27,434
Your queen got there first.

38
00:20:31,934 --> 00:20:33,975
She's everyone's queen now.

39
00:20:34,059 --> 00:20:36,601
Try telling Sansa.

40
00:20:43,434 --> 00:20:45,100
Wait for me
outside the city gates.

41
00:20:45,184 --> 00:20:46,934
- I'll come find you.
- Jon.

42
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:50,476
She knows who you are.

43
00:20:51,768 --> 00:20:53,100
Who you really are.

44
00:20:53,184 --> 00:20:55,601
You'll always
be a threat to her.

45
00:20:58,142 --> 00:21:00,684
And I know a killer
when I see one.

46
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:34,850
Did you bring any wine?

47
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:37,142
No.

48
00:21:38,768 --> 00:21:40,267
Ah...

49
00:21:40,351 --> 00:21:41,351
Well...

50
00:21:43,267 --> 00:21:45,476
thank you for coming
to see me.

51
00:21:46,768 --> 00:21:49,809
Our queen doesn't keep prisoners
for long.

52
00:21:51,309 --> 00:21:54,392
I suppose there's
a crude kind of justice.

53
00:21:56,184 --> 00:22:00,059
I betrayed my closest friend
and watched him burn.

54
00:22:00,142 --> 00:22:03,267
Now Varys's ashes
can tell my ashes:

55
00:22:03,351 --> 00:22:05,850
"See, I told you."

56
00:22:10,518 --> 00:22:12,476
It just occurred to me.

57
00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:14,184
I'm talking
to the only man alive

58
00:22:14,267 --> 00:22:16,226
who knows where I'm going.

59
00:22:17,726 --> 00:22:20,017
So is there life after death?

60
00:22:23,351 --> 00:22:24,850
Not that I've seen.

61
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:28,392
I should be thankful.

62
00:22:28,476 --> 00:22:31,351
Oblivion is the best
I could hope for.

63
00:22:32,684 --> 00:22:34,768
I strangled my lover.

64
00:22:34,850 --> 00:22:37,100
I shot my own father
with a crossbow.

65
00:22:37,184 --> 00:22:38,309
I betrayed my queen.

66
00:22:38,392 --> 00:22:39,892
- You didn't.
- I did.

67
00:22:41,726 --> 00:22:42,768
And I'd do it again,

68
00:22:42,850 --> 00:22:45,059
now that I've seen
what I've seen.

69
00:22:46,392 --> 00:22:48,392
I chose my fate.

70
00:22:48,476 --> 00:22:51,267
The people
of King's Landing did not.

71
00:22:53,559 --> 00:22:55,768
I can't justify what happened.

72
00:22:57,476 --> 00:22:58,559
I won't try.

73
00:23:01,850 --> 00:23:04,643
- But the war is over now.
- Is it?

74
00:23:06,975 --> 00:23:09,934
When you heard her
talking to her soldiers,

75
00:23:10,017 --> 00:23:13,142
did she sound like someone
who's done fighting?

76
00:23:21,434 --> 00:23:24,267
She liberated the people
of Slaver's Bay.

77
00:23:24,351 --> 00:23:27,476
She liberated the people
of King's Landing.

78
00:23:27,559 --> 00:23:29,351
And she'll go on liberating

79
00:23:29,434 --> 00:23:32,518
until the people of the world
are free...

80
00:23:32,601 --> 00:23:33,934
and she rules them all.

81
00:23:34,017 --> 00:23:37,351
And you've been by her side,
counseling her.

82
00:23:37,434 --> 00:23:38,809
Until today.

83
00:23:40,351 --> 00:23:41,601
Until today.

84
00:23:45,267 --> 00:23:47,184
Varys was right.

85
00:23:47,267 --> 00:23:49,142
I was wrong.

86
00:23:49,226 --> 00:23:52,059
It was vanity
to think I could guide her.

87
00:23:52,142 --> 00:23:54,392
Our queen's nature
is fire and blood.

88
00:23:54,476 --> 00:23:57,059
You think our house words
are stamped on our bodies

89
00:23:57,142 --> 00:23:59,226
when we're born
and that's who we are?

90
00:23:59,309 --> 00:24:01,643
Then I'd be fire and blood too.

91
00:24:03,226 --> 00:24:04,351
She's not her father,

92
00:24:04,434 --> 00:24:05,975
no more than
you're Tywin Lannister.

93
00:24:06,059 --> 00:24:11,392
My father was an evil man.
My sister was an evil woman.

94
00:24:11,476 --> 00:24:12,768
Pile up all the bodies

95
00:24:12,850 --> 00:24:14,850
of all the people
they ever killed,

96
00:24:14,934 --> 00:24:16,392
there still won't be
half as many

97
00:24:16,476 --> 00:24:19,226
as our beautiful queen
slaughtered in a single day.

98
00:24:19,309 --> 00:24:20,559
Cersei left her no choice.

99
00:24:20,643 --> 00:24:22,017
The moment the gates fell,

100
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:23,142
the battle was over.

101
00:24:23,226 --> 00:24:25,226
She saw her friend beheaded.

102
00:24:25,309 --> 00:24:27,142
She saw her dragon
shot out of the sky.

103
00:24:27,226 --> 00:24:29,059
And she burned down
a city for it.

104
00:24:29,142 --> 00:24:31,643
Ah, it's easy to judge
when you're standing

105
00:24:31,726 --> 00:24:32,892
far from the battlefield.

106
00:24:32,975 --> 00:24:34,643
Would you have done it?

107
00:24:36,226 --> 00:24:37,476
What?

108
00:24:38,975 --> 00:24:41,643
You've been up there,
on a dragon's back.

109
00:24:41,726 --> 00:24:43,017
You've had that power.

110
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:44,934
Would you have burned
the city down?

111
00:24:48,850 --> 00:24:50,934
I don't know.

112
00:24:51,017 --> 00:24:52,434
Yes, you do.

113
00:24:54,476 --> 00:24:57,518
You won't say because
you don't want to betray her...

114
00:24:59,392 --> 00:25:00,726
but you know.

115
00:25:09,059 --> 00:25:11,267
What's it matter what I'd do?

116
00:25:11,351 --> 00:25:14,518
It matters more than anything.

117
00:25:18,809 --> 00:25:21,559
When she murdered
the slavers of Astapor,

118
00:25:22,892 --> 00:25:25,142
I'm sure no one
but the slavers complained.

119
00:25:25,226 --> 00:25:27,100
After all, they were evil men.

120
00:25:28,809 --> 00:25:32,643
When she crucified hundreds
of Meereenese nobles,

121
00:25:32,726 --> 00:25:33,726
who could argue?

122
00:25:33,768 --> 00:25:35,267
They were evil men.

123
00:25:36,518 --> 00:25:40,100
The Dothraki khals
she burned alive?

124
00:25:40,184 --> 00:25:42,768
They would have
done worse to her.

125
00:25:44,226 --> 00:25:48,434
Everywhere she goes,
evil men die

126
00:25:48,518 --> 00:25:50,643
and we cheer her for it.

127
00:25:52,017 --> 00:25:53,351
And she grows more powerful

128
00:25:53,434 --> 00:25:56,975
and more sure
that she is good and right.

129
00:26:02,392 --> 00:26:03,684
She believes her destiny

130
00:26:03,768 --> 00:26:07,059
is to build a better world
for everyone.

131
00:26:07,142 --> 00:26:08,601
If you believed that...

132
00:26:10,226 --> 00:26:11,434
if you truly believed it,

133
00:26:11,518 --> 00:26:12,684
wouldn't you kill

134
00:26:12,768 --> 00:26:15,518
whoever stood between
you and paradise?

135
00:26:46,975 --> 00:26:49,142
I know you love her.

136
00:26:54,392 --> 00:26:56,309
I love her too.

137
00:26:59,975 --> 00:27:03,643
Not as successfully as you.

138
00:27:06,309 --> 00:27:10,809
But I believed in her
with all my heart.

139
00:27:18,559 --> 00:27:21,975
Love is more powerful
than reason.

140
00:27:24,643 --> 00:27:26,726
We all know that.

141
00:27:26,809 --> 00:27:28,518
Look at my brother.

142
00:27:33,601 --> 00:27:35,892
"Love is the death of duty."

143
00:27:41,601 --> 00:27:43,684
You just came up with that?

144
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:52,518
Maester Aemon said it
a long time ago.

145
00:27:57,601 --> 00:28:02,100
Sometimes
duty is the death of love.

146
00:28:07,518 --> 00:28:11,643
You are the shield
that guards the realms of men.

147
00:28:11,726 --> 00:28:14,142
And you've always tried
to do the right thing.

148
00:28:14,226 --> 00:28:15,892
No matter the cost,

149
00:28:16,892 --> 00:28:19,226
you've tried to protect people.

150
00:28:21,392 --> 00:28:24,559
Who is the greatest threat
to the people now?

151
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:34,726
It's a terrible thing
I'm asking.

152
00:28:36,100 --> 00:28:38,142
It's also the right thing.

153
00:28:40,434 --> 00:28:43,892
Do you think I'm the last man
she'll execute?

154
00:28:45,892 --> 00:28:47,142
Who is more dangerous

155
00:28:47,226 --> 00:28:50,601
than the rightful heir
to the Iron Throne?

156
00:29:03,601 --> 00:29:06,434
That's her decision.
She is the queen.

157
00:29:15,184 --> 00:29:17,142
I'm sorry it came to this.

158
00:29:29,017 --> 00:29:30,809
And your sisters?

159
00:29:32,809 --> 00:29:35,684
Do you see them
bending the knee?

160
00:29:39,309 --> 00:29:41,059
My sisters will be loyal
to the throne.

161
00:29:41,142 --> 00:29:44,892
Why do you think Sansa
told me the truth about you?

162
00:29:44,975 --> 00:29:47,059
Because she doesn't want Dany
to be queen.

163
00:29:47,142 --> 00:29:50,059
- She doesn't get to choose.
- No.

164
00:29:50,142 --> 00:29:51,476
But you do.

165
00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:54,975
And you have to choose now.

166
00:33:55,267 --> 00:33:57,809
When I was a girl,
my brother told me it was made

167
00:33:57,892 --> 00:34:01,392
with 1000 swords
from Aegon's fallen enemies.

168
00:34:04,267 --> 00:34:06,100
What do 1000 swords look like

169
00:34:06,184 --> 00:34:08,934
in the mind of a little girl
who can't count to 20?

170
00:34:10,351 --> 00:34:14,184
I imagined a mountain of swords
too high to climb.

171
00:34:14,267 --> 00:34:15,684
So many fallen enemies,

172
00:34:15,768 --> 00:34:17,975
you could only see
the soles of Aegon's feet.

173
00:34:18,059 --> 00:34:19,226
I saw them executing

174
00:34:19,309 --> 00:34:21,226
Lannister prisoners
in the street.

175
00:34:22,518 --> 00:34:24,850
They said they were acting
on your orders.

176
00:34:24,934 --> 00:34:28,142
- It was necessary.
- Necessary?

177
00:34:28,226 --> 00:34:30,017
Have you been down there?

178
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:31,351
Have you seen?

179
00:34:31,434 --> 00:34:34,184
Children,
little children, burned!

180
00:34:36,975 --> 00:34:39,601
I tried to make peace
with Cersei.

181
00:34:40,934 --> 00:34:44,476
She used their innocence
as a weapon against me.

182
00:34:44,559 --> 00:34:46,351
She thought
it would cripple me.

183
00:34:46,434 --> 00:34:48,100
And Tyrion?

184
00:34:51,434 --> 00:34:55,059
He conspired behind my back
with my enemies.

185
00:34:55,142 --> 00:34:57,975
How have you treated people
who've done the same to you,

186
00:34:58,059 --> 00:35:00,601
even when it broke your heart?

187
00:35:03,100 --> 00:35:04,643
Forgive him.

188
00:35:06,975 --> 00:35:08,684
- I can't.
- You can.

189
00:35:10,309 --> 00:35:11,601
You can forgive all of them,

190
00:35:11,684 --> 00:35:14,392
make them see
they made a mistake.

191
00:35:14,476 --> 00:35:16,309
Make them understand.

192
00:35:20,975 --> 00:35:22,975
Please, Dany.

193
00:35:26,184 --> 00:35:28,809
We can't hide behind
small mercies.

194
00:35:30,142 --> 00:35:32,184
The world we need

195
00:35:32,267 --> 00:35:35,017
won't be built by men
loyal to the world we have.

196
00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:39,100
The world we need is a world
of mercy. It has to be.

197
00:35:39,184 --> 00:35:40,726
And it will be.

198
00:35:43,559 --> 00:35:48,518
It's not easy to see something
that's never been before.

199
00:35:51,059 --> 00:35:52,850
A good world.

200
00:35:53,850 --> 00:35:55,518
How do you know?

201
00:35:57,392 --> 00:35:59,601
How do you know it'll be good?

202
00:35:59,684 --> 00:36:01,434
Because I know what is good.

203
00:36:02,809 --> 00:36:04,017
And so do you.

204
00:36:04,100 --> 00:36:06,434
- I don't.
- You do.

205
00:36:06,518 --> 00:36:09,184
You do. You've always known.

206
00:36:12,017 --> 00:36:13,850
What about everyone else?

207
00:36:15,684 --> 00:36:19,017
All the other people
who think they know what's good.

208
00:36:21,184 --> 00:36:23,351
They don't get to choose.

209
00:36:29,142 --> 00:36:30,309
Be with me.

210
00:36:31,892 --> 00:36:34,017
Build the new world with me.

211
00:36:34,100 --> 00:36:36,476
This is our reason.

212
00:36:36,559 --> 00:36:38,059
It has been
from the beginning,

213
00:36:38,142 --> 00:36:41,309
since you were a little boy
with a bastard's name

214
00:36:41,392 --> 00:36:44,892
and I was a little girl
who couldn't count to 20.

215
00:36:45,726 --> 00:36:47,559
We do it together.

216
00:36:49,684 --> 00:36:52,809
We break the wheel together.

217
00:36:55,726 --> 00:36:57,392
You are my queen.

218
00:36:58,768 --> 00:37:01,643
Now, and always.

219
00:44:23,892 --> 00:44:25,351
Where's Jon?

220
00:44:25,434 --> 00:44:28,518
- He is our prisoner.
- So is Lord Tyrion.

221
00:44:28,601 --> 00:44:30,850
They were both to be brought
to this gathering.

222
00:44:30,934 --> 00:44:33,643
We will decide what we do
with our prisoners.

223
00:44:33,726 --> 00:44:35,100
This is our city now.

224
00:44:35,184 --> 00:44:37,601
If you look outside the walls
of your city,

225
00:44:37,684 --> 00:44:39,267
you'll find thousands
of Northmen

226
00:44:39,351 --> 00:44:41,975
who will explain to you
why harming Jon Snow

227
00:44:42,059 --> 00:44:43,726
is not in your interest.

228
00:44:43,809 --> 00:44:45,768
And you will find
thousands of Unsullied

229
00:44:45,850 --> 00:44:47,017
who believe that it is.

230
00:44:47,100 --> 00:44:49,809
Some of you may be
quick to forgive.

231
00:44:49,892 --> 00:44:51,975
The Ironborn are not.

232
00:44:52,059 --> 00:44:53,975
I swore to follow
Daenerys Targaryen.

233
00:44:54,059 --> 00:44:55,809
You swore to follow a tyrant.

234
00:44:55,892 --> 00:44:57,684
She freed us from a tyrant.

235
00:44:57,768 --> 00:44:59,226
Cersei is gone because of her,

236
00:44:59,309 --> 00:45:01,643
and Jon Snow put a knife
in her heart.

237
00:45:01,726 --> 00:45:03,975
Let the Unsullied give him
what he deserves.

238
00:45:04,059 --> 00:45:06,017
Say another word
about killing my brother

239
00:45:06,100 --> 00:45:07,392
and I'll cut your throat.

240
00:45:07,476 --> 00:45:08,892
Friends, please.

241
00:45:10,892 --> 00:45:14,100
We've been cutting each other's
throats long enough.

242
00:45:14,184 --> 00:45:16,975
Torgo Nudho.
Am I saying that properly?

243
00:45:20,518 --> 00:45:22,142
If it weren't for you
and your men,

244
00:45:22,226 --> 00:45:24,643
we would've lost the war
with the dead.

245
00:45:24,726 --> 00:45:27,309
This country owes you
a debt it can never repay,

246
00:45:27,392 --> 00:45:29,017
but let us try.

247
00:45:29,100 --> 00:45:31,142
There is land in the Reach.

248
00:45:31,226 --> 00:45:32,476
Good land.

249
00:45:32,559 --> 00:45:35,100
The people that used to live
there are gone.

250
00:45:35,184 --> 00:45:37,184
Make it your own.
Start your own house

251
00:45:37,267 --> 00:45:39,726
with the Unsullied
as your bannermen.

252
00:45:39,809 --> 00:45:41,684
We've had enough war.

253
00:45:41,768 --> 00:45:44,017
Thousands of you,
thousands of them.

254
00:45:44,100 --> 00:45:46,017
You know how it ends.

255
00:45:46,100 --> 00:45:47,809
We need to find a better way.

256
00:45:47,892 --> 00:45:50,351
We do not need payment.

257
00:45:50,434 --> 00:45:51,934
We need justice.

258
00:45:53,142 --> 00:45:54,934
Jon Snow cannot go free.

259
00:45:58,184 --> 00:45:59,850
It's not for you to decide.

260
00:45:59,934 --> 00:46:01,434
You are not here to speak!

261
00:46:02,684 --> 00:46:05,017
Everyone has heard enough words
from you.

262
00:46:07,100 --> 00:46:08,934
You're right.

263
00:46:09,017 --> 00:46:11,643
And no one's any better for it.

264
00:46:12,975 --> 00:46:15,142
But it's not for you to decide.

265
00:46:16,809 --> 00:46:19,059
Jon committed his crime here.

266
00:46:19,142 --> 00:46:22,643
His fate
is for our king to decide.

267
00:46:22,726 --> 00:46:24,017
Or our queen.

268
00:46:24,100 --> 00:46:26,309
We don't have a king or queen.

269
00:46:27,643 --> 00:46:30,643
You're the most powerful people
in Westeros.

270
00:46:33,017 --> 00:46:34,643
Choose one.

271
00:46:44,267 --> 00:46:45,809
Make your choice, then.

272
00:47:08,518 --> 00:47:10,100
My lords and ladies...

273
00:47:13,518 --> 00:47:18,100
I suppose this is the most
important moment of our lives.

274
00:47:18,184 --> 00:47:20,434
What we decide today
will reverberate

275
00:47:20,518 --> 00:47:22,226
through the annals of history.

276
00:47:22,309 --> 00:47:24,267
I stand before you

277
00:47:24,351 --> 00:47:27,351
as one of the senior lords
in the country.

278
00:47:28,226 --> 00:47:30,017
A veteran of two wars.

279
00:47:31,184 --> 00:47:32,726
And I like to think
my experience

280
00:47:32,809 --> 00:47:36,643
has led to some small skill
in statecraft

281
00:47:36,726 --> 00:47:38,142
- and underst...
- Uncle?

282
00:47:41,059 --> 00:47:42,059
Please sit.

283
00:48:14,017 --> 00:48:16,434
Well, we have to choose someone.

284
00:48:16,518 --> 00:48:17,768
Um, ahem...

285
00:48:17,850 --> 00:48:19,643
Why just us?

286
00:48:23,768 --> 00:48:24,934
Um...

287
00:48:26,684 --> 00:48:29,017
We represent
all the great houses,

288
00:48:29,100 --> 00:48:30,392
but whomever we choose,

289
00:48:30,476 --> 00:48:33,768
they won't just rule over
lords and ladies.

290
00:48:33,850 --> 00:48:37,184
Maybe the decision about
what's best for everyone

291
00:48:37,267 --> 00:48:38,434
should be left to...

292
00:48:39,601 --> 00:48:42,309
well, everyone.

293
00:48:55,809 --> 00:48:58,726
Maybe we should give the dogs
a vote as well.

294
00:48:58,809 --> 00:49:00,309
I'll ask my horse.

295
00:49:09,476 --> 00:49:12,059
I suppose you want the crown.

296
00:49:12,142 --> 00:49:13,559
Me?

297
00:49:14,142 --> 00:49:15,643
The Imp?

298
00:49:17,267 --> 00:49:19,643
Half the people hate me
for serving Daenerys,

299
00:49:19,726 --> 00:49:21,850
the other half hate me
for betraying her.

300
00:49:23,809 --> 00:49:27,309
- Can't think of a worse choice.
- Who, then?

301
00:49:33,809 --> 00:49:38,017
I've had nothing to do but think
these past few weeks.

302
00:49:39,726 --> 00:49:42,100
About our bloody history.

303
00:49:43,518 --> 00:49:45,726
About the mistakes we've made.

304
00:49:56,684 --> 00:49:59,017
What unites people?

305
00:50:01,392 --> 00:50:02,850
Armies?

306
00:50:04,392 --> 00:50:05,768
Gold?

307
00:50:08,059 --> 00:50:09,850
Flags?

308
00:50:16,559 --> 00:50:18,184
Stories.

309
00:50:20,059 --> 00:50:22,267
There's nothing in the world
more powerful

310
00:50:22,351 --> 00:50:23,559
than a good story.

311
00:50:25,892 --> 00:50:27,559
Nothing can stop it.

312
00:50:28,892 --> 00:50:30,768
No enemy can defeat it.

313
00:50:32,518 --> 00:50:34,142
And who has a better story...

314
00:50:35,434 --> 00:50:37,100
than Bran the Broken?

315
00:50:40,975 --> 00:50:44,226
The boy who fell
from a high tower and lived.

316
00:50:45,726 --> 00:50:49,809
He knew he'd never walk again,
so he learned to fly.

317
00:50:50,975 --> 00:50:53,392
He crossed beyond the Wall,

318
00:50:53,476 --> 00:50:54,975
a crippled boy,

319
00:50:55,059 --> 00:50:57,768
and became the Three-Eyed Raven.

320
00:51:00,142 --> 00:51:02,142
He is our memory,

321
00:51:02,226 --> 00:51:04,892
the keeper of all our stories.

322
00:51:04,975 --> 00:51:09,434
The wars, weddings, births,
massacres, famines.

323
00:51:09,518 --> 00:51:11,434
Our triumphs,

324
00:51:11,518 --> 00:51:14,059
mm, our defeats,

325
00:51:14,142 --> 00:51:15,267
our past.

326
00:51:17,142 --> 00:51:19,934
Who better to lead us
into the future?

327
00:51:22,934 --> 00:51:26,726
Bran has no interest in ruling
and he can't father children.

328
00:51:26,809 --> 00:51:28,017
Good.

329
00:51:28,100 --> 00:51:30,601
Sons of kings
can be cruel and stupid,

330
00:51:30,684 --> 00:51:32,100
as you well know.

331
00:51:33,142 --> 00:51:35,100
His will never torment us.

332
00:51:39,184 --> 00:51:42,476
That is the wheel
our queen wanted to break.

333
00:51:49,643 --> 00:51:52,726
From now on,
rulers will not be born.

334
00:51:52,809 --> 00:51:55,643
They will be chosen
on this spot

335
00:51:55,726 --> 00:51:58,726
by the lords and ladies
of Westeros...

336
00:51:58,809 --> 00:52:00,975
to serve the realm.

337
00:52:09,017 --> 00:52:11,017
I know you don't want it.

338
00:52:12,226 --> 00:52:15,809
I know you don't care
about power.

339
00:52:17,892 --> 00:52:21,850
But I ask you now,
if we choose you...

340
00:52:23,434 --> 00:52:24,892
will you wear the crown?

341
00:52:26,559 --> 00:52:29,643
Will you lead the Seven Kingdoms
to the best of your abilities

342
00:52:29,726 --> 00:52:32,518
from this day
until your last day?

343
00:52:38,184 --> 00:52:41,100
Why do you think
I came all this way?

344
00:52:47,684 --> 00:52:49,850
To Brandon of House Stark...

345
00:52:51,309 --> 00:52:52,518
I say aye.

346
00:53:04,142 --> 00:53:05,184
Aye.

347
00:53:11,892 --> 00:53:12,892
Aye.

348
00:53:14,184 --> 00:53:15,184
Aye.

349
00:53:18,226 --> 00:53:19,309
Aye.

350
00:53:22,184 --> 00:53:23,184
Aye.

351
00:53:27,768 --> 00:53:29,476
Aye.

352
00:53:29,559 --> 00:53:31,142
Aye.

353
00:53:31,226 --> 00:53:32,476
Aye.

354
00:53:32,559 --> 00:53:34,601
- Aye.
- Aye.

355
00:53:34,684 --> 00:53:35,684
Aye.

356
00:53:37,559 --> 00:53:40,226
I'm not sure I get a vote,
but aye.

357
00:53:42,351 --> 00:53:43,351
Aye.

358
00:53:54,476 --> 00:53:56,768
I love you, little brother.
I always will.

359
00:53:56,850 --> 00:53:58,601
You'll be a good king.

360
00:53:59,850 --> 00:54:02,142
But tens of thousands
of Northmen

361
00:54:02,226 --> 00:54:05,017
fell in the Great War
defending all of Westeros.

362
00:54:05,100 --> 00:54:07,100
And those who survived
have seen too much

363
00:54:07,184 --> 00:54:10,100
and fought too hard
ever to kneel again.

364
00:54:12,809 --> 00:54:16,309
The North will remain
an independent kingdom,

365
00:54:16,392 --> 00:54:18,434
as it was
for thousands of years.

366
00:54:43,559 --> 00:54:46,392
All hail Bran the Broken,

367
00:54:46,476 --> 00:54:47,601
First of His Name,

368
00:54:47,684 --> 00:54:50,892
King of the Andals
and the First Men,

369
00:54:50,975 --> 00:54:55,684
Lord of the Six Kingdoms
and Protector of the Realm.

370
00:54:58,476 --> 00:55:01,476
All hail Bran the Broken!

371
00:55:13,309 --> 00:55:15,100
Lord Tyrion...

372
00:55:16,518 --> 00:55:18,309
you will be my Hand.

373
00:55:18,392 --> 00:55:20,100
N...

374
00:55:20,184 --> 00:55:23,434
No, Your Grace,
I don't want it.

375
00:55:23,518 --> 00:55:25,601
And I don't want to be king.

376
00:55:27,684 --> 00:55:29,975
I don't deserve it.

377
00:55:30,059 --> 00:55:32,934
I thought I was wise,
but I wasn't.

378
00:55:33,017 --> 00:55:37,100
I thought I knew what was right,
but I didn't.

379
00:55:39,434 --> 00:55:40,934
Choose Ser Davos.

380
00:55:41,017 --> 00:55:42,392
Choose anyone else.

381
00:55:42,476 --> 00:55:44,768
- I choose you.
- You cannot.

382
00:55:44,850 --> 00:55:46,601
Yes, I can.

383
00:55:46,684 --> 00:55:49,100
- I'm king.
- This man is a criminal.

384
00:55:49,184 --> 00:55:52,476
- He deserves justice.
- He just got it.

385
00:55:52,559 --> 00:55:55,017
He's made many
terrible mistakes.

386
00:55:55,100 --> 00:55:58,559
He's going to spend the rest
of his life fixing them.

387
00:56:03,309 --> 00:56:04,975
It is not enough.

388
00:56:13,017 --> 00:56:15,809
Giving you to the
Unsullied would start a war.

389
00:56:17,226 --> 00:56:19,392
Letting you walk free
would start a war.

390
00:56:20,559 --> 00:56:21,975
So our new king has chosen

391
00:56:22,059 --> 00:56:23,809
to send you
to the Night's Watch.

392
00:56:25,892 --> 00:56:27,476
There's still a Night's Watch?

393
00:56:29,726 --> 00:56:31,309
The world will always
need a home

394
00:56:31,392 --> 00:56:32,809
for bastards and broken men.

395
00:56:37,892 --> 00:56:40,017
You shall take no wife,

396
00:56:40,100 --> 00:56:42,184
hold no lands,

397
00:56:42,267 --> 00:56:43,809
father no children.

398
00:56:46,934 --> 00:56:49,768
The Unsullied wanted your head
of course,

399
00:56:49,850 --> 00:56:53,184
but Grey Worm has accepted
the justice of a life sentence.

400
00:56:54,850 --> 00:56:58,017
Sansa and Arya wanted you freed,

401
00:56:58,100 --> 00:57:02,100
but they understand our new king
needs to make peace.

402
00:57:02,184 --> 00:57:03,643
No one is very happy.

403
00:57:04,809 --> 00:57:06,684
Which means
it's a good compromise,

404
00:57:06,768 --> 00:57:07,768
I suppose.

405
00:57:09,643 --> 00:57:11,351
Was it right?

406
00:57:14,434 --> 00:57:15,934
What I did?

407
00:57:18,809 --> 00:57:20,559
What we did.

408
00:57:24,226 --> 00:57:26,184
It doesn't feel right.

409
00:57:32,809 --> 00:57:35,309
Ask me again in 10 years.

410
00:57:57,809 --> 00:58:01,267
I don't expect
we'll ever see each other again.

411
00:58:05,267 --> 00:58:06,684
I wouldn't be so sure.

412
00:58:07,934 --> 00:58:09,434
A few years as Hand of the King

413
00:58:09,518 --> 00:58:12,518
would make anyone want to
piss off the edge of the world.

414
01:00:31,309 --> 01:00:33,975
I wish there had been another way.

415
01:00:35,476 --> 01:00:36,975
Can you forgive me?

416
01:00:49,226 --> 01:00:51,726
The North is free,
thanks to you.

417
01:00:53,768 --> 01:00:55,892
But they lost their king.

418
01:00:57,184 --> 01:01:00,017
Ned Stark's daughter
will speak for them.

419
01:01:02,100 --> 01:01:04,518
She's the best
they could ask for.

420
01:01:24,476 --> 01:01:27,518
You can come see me, you know,
at Castle Black.

421
01:01:28,726 --> 01:01:30,309
I can't.

422
01:01:30,392 --> 01:01:33,975
You think anyone will dare
tell you women aren't allowed?

423
01:01:39,684 --> 01:01:41,142
I'm not going back north.

424
01:01:43,184 --> 01:01:44,643
Where are you going?

425
01:01:46,726 --> 01:01:48,892
What's west of Westeros?

426
01:01:51,351 --> 01:01:52,850
I don't know.

427
01:01:52,934 --> 01:01:54,226
No one knows.

428
01:01:55,434 --> 01:01:57,643
It's where all the maps stop.

429
01:01:59,726 --> 01:02:01,434
That's where I'm going.

430
01:02:10,351 --> 01:02:11,601
You have your Needle?

431
01:02:12,934 --> 01:02:13,934
Right here.

432
01:02:36,017 --> 01:02:37,684
Your Grace.

433
01:02:46,559 --> 01:02:49,267
I'm sorry I wasn't there
when you needed me.

434
01:02:51,309 --> 01:02:54,226
You were exactly where
you were supposed to be.

435
01:07:07,892 --> 01:07:09,559
That's not... Uh...

436
01:07:15,059 --> 01:07:16,142
What's this?

437
01:07:16,226 --> 01:07:18,809
A Song of Ice and Fire.

438
01:07:18,892 --> 01:07:20,809
Archmaester Ebrose's history
of the wars

439
01:07:20,892 --> 01:07:23,142
following the death
of King Robert.

440
01:07:23,226 --> 01:07:25,434
I helped him with the title.

441
01:07:28,184 --> 01:07:30,850
I suppose I come in
for some heavy criticism.

442
01:07:30,934 --> 01:07:33,309
Oh, I wouldn't say that.

443
01:07:33,392 --> 01:07:36,100
Oh, he's kind to me.
Never would've guessed.

444
01:07:40,351 --> 01:07:41,809
He's not kind?

445
01:07:42,809 --> 01:07:44,267
- He...
- He what?

446
01:07:45,392 --> 01:07:47,476
What does he say about me?

447
01:07:52,809 --> 01:07:56,434
I don't believe
you're mentioned, ahem.

448
01:08:18,017 --> 01:08:19,184
- Your Grace.
- Your Grace.

449
01:08:19,267 --> 01:08:20,476
- Your Grace.
- Your Grace.

450
01:08:39,309 --> 01:08:42,392
We appear to be missing
a Master of Whisperers.

451
01:08:42,476 --> 01:08:44,059
And a Master of Laws.

452
01:08:44,142 --> 01:08:46,476
- And a Master of War.
- Yes, Your Grace.

453
01:08:46,559 --> 01:08:48,518
Suitable prospects
will be brought to you

454
01:08:48,601 --> 01:08:50,518
for an audience
in the coming weeks.

455
01:08:51,809 --> 01:08:54,351
And Drogon? Any word?

456
01:08:54,434 --> 01:08:56,392
He was last spotted flying east,
toward...

457
01:08:56,476 --> 01:08:58,184
The farther away, the better.

458
01:08:59,934 --> 01:09:01,184
Perhaps I can find him.

459
01:09:02,351 --> 01:09:03,850
Do carry on with the rest.

460
01:09:05,017 --> 01:09:06,892
As you wish, Your Grace.

461
01:09:09,059 --> 01:09:10,559
Ser Podrick.

462
01:09:19,184 --> 01:09:21,850
We serve at your pleasure,
King Bran the Broken,

463
01:09:21,934 --> 01:09:25,518
ruler of the Six Kingdoms
and Protector of the Realm.

464
01:09:25,601 --> 01:09:27,684
- Long may he reign.
- Long may he reign.

465
01:09:27,768 --> 01:09:29,726
- Long may he reign.
- Long may he reign.

466
01:09:29,809 --> 01:09:31,184
Long may he reign.

467
01:09:32,684 --> 01:09:33,850
That will improve.

468
01:09:35,017 --> 01:09:36,351
I'm sure it will.

469
01:09:43,850 --> 01:09:46,059
Ser Bronn of the Blackwater,

470
01:09:46,142 --> 01:09:47,267
Lord of Highgarden,

471
01:09:47,351 --> 01:09:48,975
Lord Paramount of the Reach

472
01:09:49,059 --> 01:09:50,476
and Master of Coin,

473
01:09:50,559 --> 01:09:54,142
would you say the crown's debt
to you has been paid?

474
01:09:54,226 --> 01:09:56,017
In full, my lord Hand.

475
01:09:56,100 --> 01:09:57,142
Good.

476
01:09:57,226 --> 01:09:59,476
Time to start incurring
a new one.

477
01:09:59,559 --> 01:10:00,934
We have hungry people to feed.

478
01:10:01,017 --> 01:10:02,809
Can we expect some assistance
in this regard?

479
01:10:02,892 --> 01:10:04,476
Indeed we can.

480
01:10:04,559 --> 01:10:08,100
Lord Davos, we have an armada
to rebuild and ports to repair.

481
01:10:08,184 --> 01:10:10,267
We have. These projects
will begin as soon as

482
01:10:10,351 --> 01:10:13,643
the Master of Coin and Lord of
Lofty Titles provides funding.

483
01:10:13,726 --> 01:10:16,975
The Master of Coin looks forward
to helping the Master of Ships,

484
01:10:17,059 --> 01:10:19,768
but first he has to ensure
we're not wasting coin,

485
01:10:19,850 --> 01:10:21,684
or soon there won't be
no more coin.

486
01:10:21,768 --> 01:10:22,934
"Any more."

487
01:10:23,017 --> 01:10:24,476
You Master of Grammar now too?

488
01:10:24,559 --> 01:10:26,351
Grandmaester, ahem,

489
01:10:26,434 --> 01:10:28,643
it is my theory,
based on my years of work

490
01:10:28,726 --> 01:10:29,975
on the Casterly Rock sewers,

491
01:10:30,059 --> 01:10:32,100
that clean water
leads to a healthier population.

492
01:10:32,184 --> 01:10:34,934
The Archmaester has done
some research on this subject

493
01:10:35,017 --> 01:10:36,059
and it turns out...

494
01:10:36,142 --> 01:10:38,392
The strong live
and the weak don't.

495
01:10:38,476 --> 01:10:40,392
Find the best builders
and set them to the task.

496
01:10:40,476 --> 01:10:43,975
Oh, speaking of builders,
all the best brothels burned down.

497
01:10:44,059 --> 01:10:46,809
The Master of Coin is willing
to fund reconstruction.

498
01:10:46,892 --> 01:10:49,850
Uh...
the Archmaester is less than enthusiastic

499
01:10:49,934 --> 01:10:52,184
about the salutary effects
of brothels.

500
01:10:52,267 --> 01:10:54,726
Well,
I imagine he isn't using them properly.

501
01:10:54,809 --> 01:10:56,975
I think we can all agree that ships

502
01:10:57,059 --> 01:10:58,601
take precedence over brothels.

503
01:10:58,684 --> 01:11:01,351
I think that's a very presumptuous statement.

504
01:11:02,768 --> 01:11:04,309
I once brought a jackass

505
01:11:04,392 --> 01:11:06,643
and a honeycomb into a brothel.

506
01:15:26,142 --> 01:15:27,975
The Queen in the North!

507
01:15:28,059 --> 01:15:29,975
The Queen in the North!

508
01:15:30,059 --> 01:15:31,768
The Queen in the North!

509
01:15:31,850 --> 01:15:33,434
The Queen in the North!

510
01:15:33,518 --> 01:15:34,934
The Queen in the North!

511
01:15:35,017 --> 01:15:36,726
The Queen in the North!
