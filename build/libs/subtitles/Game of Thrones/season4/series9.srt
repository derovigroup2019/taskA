5
00:02:25,072 --> 00:02:27,307
What was she like?

6
00:02:29,743 --> 00:02:31,644
She...

7
00:02:33,481 --> 00:02:35,949
she had red hair.

8
00:02:37,585 --> 00:02:39,619
Oh?

9
00:02:39,653 --> 00:02:42,088
- How big were her feet?
- What do you want me to say?

10
00:02:42,123 --> 00:02:45,458
I want you to tell me what
it was like to have someone.

11
00:02:45,493 --> 00:02:47,460
To be with someone.

12
00:02:47,495 --> 00:02:49,295
To love someone and have
them love you back.

13
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:56,736
We're all gonna die a lot
sooner than I'd planned.

14
00:02:56,770 --> 00:03:00,406
You're the closest
I'll ever get to knowing.

15
00:03:03,944 --> 00:03:05,545
So you and Gilly never?

16
00:03:05,579 --> 00:03:06,880
No.

17
00:03:06,914 --> 00:03:09,182
She just had a baby.

18
00:03:11,919 --> 00:03:13,386
And she never offered.

19
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:15,855
But if she had,

20
00:03:15,890 --> 00:03:18,558
you would have?

21
00:03:18,592 --> 00:03:21,361
You'd have broken
your vows?

22
00:03:25,266 --> 00:03:27,333
The interesting
thing is,

23
00:03:27,368 --> 00:03:30,436
our vows never
specifically forbid

24
00:03:30,471 --> 00:03:32,472
intimate relations
with women.

25
00:03:32,506 --> 00:03:34,140
What?

26
00:03:34,175 --> 00:03:35,367
"I shall take no wife,"

27
00:03:35,392 --> 00:03:37,193
yes, that's in there.
There's no denying that.

28
00:03:37,611 --> 00:03:40,046
"I shall father no children."
It's very specific.

29
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:42,849
But what do our vows
have to say about other...

30
00:03:42,883 --> 00:03:46,052
activities is open
to interpretation.

31
00:03:48,022 --> 00:03:51,524
I don't think Ser Alliser
cares much for interpretation.

32
00:03:55,829 --> 00:03:58,998
Anyway, there's nothing
for him to interpret.

33
00:03:59,033 --> 00:04:01,034
We didn't.

34
00:04:04,438 --> 00:04:06,406
So what's it like?

35
00:04:08,142 --> 00:04:09,976
It's...

36
00:04:11,278 --> 00:04:15,014
there's this person,
this whole other person.

37
00:04:15,049 --> 00:04:18,451
And you're wrapped up in them
and they're wrapped up in you.

38
00:04:18,485 --> 00:04:20,653
And you--

39
00:04:20,688 --> 00:04:22,689
for a little--

40
00:04:22,723 --> 00:04:25,024
for a little while,
you're more than just you.

41
00:04:25,059 --> 00:04:28,294
You're-- I don't know.
I'm not a bleeding poet.

42
00:04:28,329 --> 00:04:30,230
No, you're really not.

43
00:04:30,264 --> 00:04:32,131
What did I get for it?

44
00:04:32,166 --> 00:04:35,101
An arrow six inches
from my heart.

45
00:04:36,604 --> 00:04:39,205
There'll be arrows for all
of us soon, I imagine.

46
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:40,840
There will.

47
00:04:40,874 --> 00:04:44,177
They've already done the worst thing
to me they could ever do.

48
00:04:47,014 --> 00:04:49,048
Go get some sleep, Sam.

49
00:04:49,083 --> 00:04:51,317
I'll take this watch.

50
00:05:33,927 --> 00:05:36,963
Did I ever
tell you about her?

51
00:05:36,997 --> 00:05:40,066
- My Sheila?
- Yes.

52
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:42,435
That was a night
to remember.

53
00:05:42,469 --> 00:05:45,905
Of course, I'd had
a good bit to drink.

54
00:05:47,675 --> 00:05:49,142
Her fangs were sharp,

55
00:05:49,176 --> 00:05:51,377
but she knew
how to use them.

56
00:05:51,412 --> 00:05:55,181
And she was nice
and soft down below.

57
00:05:55,215 --> 00:05:57,817
No, she was no
ordinary beast.

58
00:05:57,851 --> 00:05:59,719
Many is the man who--

59
00:05:59,753 --> 00:06:01,854
I know you never
fucked a bear.

60
00:06:01,889 --> 00:06:04,657
You know you never
fucked a bear.

61
00:06:04,692 --> 00:06:07,960
Right now I don't want to think
about the bear you never fucked.

62
00:06:07,995 --> 00:06:11,097
Right now all I want
to think about

63
00:06:11,131 --> 00:06:13,900
is each one of these arrows finding
its way into a crow's heart.

64
00:06:15,436 --> 00:06:17,503
We could be waiting
here a while.

65
00:06:17,538 --> 00:06:18,871
Good.

66
00:06:18,906 --> 00:06:20,907
The longer we wait,
the more arrows I'll have.

67
00:06:25,312 --> 00:06:28,514
They came up here
to our land

68
00:06:28,549 --> 00:06:31,084
and put up a big wall
and said it was theirs.

69
00:06:31,118 --> 00:06:33,519
Then they started
hunting us down.

70
00:06:35,289 --> 00:06:38,858
This time, we're the ones
doing the hunting.

71
00:06:40,561 --> 00:06:43,363
You've got a lot
to say about killing.

72
00:06:43,397 --> 00:06:45,465
Even more words
than arrows.

73
00:06:47,134 --> 00:06:49,969
Back in those villages, I killed
just as many of them as you did.

74
00:06:50,003 --> 00:06:52,004
More, I reckon.

75
00:06:52,039 --> 00:06:56,109
Yes, but none of those
were your crow lover.

76
00:06:56,143 --> 00:06:57,910
I probably killed
him already.

77
00:06:57,945 --> 00:06:59,379
<i>So you've said.</i>

78
00:06:59,413 --> 00:07:01,581
And if not,

79
00:07:01,615 --> 00:07:05,284
the only thing left of him is gonna be
his fun bits hanging around my neck.

80
00:07:05,319 --> 00:07:07,153
<i>More words.</i>

81
00:07:07,187 --> 00:07:09,522
Know what I think
you do when you see him?

82
00:07:09,556 --> 00:07:13,393
Serve him up a nice juicy
slice of ginger minge.

83
00:07:16,397 --> 00:07:19,766
You been thinking
about that ginger minge?

84
00:07:21,301 --> 00:07:23,636
Wondering what
it tastes like?

85
00:07:26,039 --> 00:07:28,608
Maybe I have.

86
00:07:28,642 --> 00:07:31,144
Jon Snow is mine.

87
00:07:32,980 --> 00:07:35,081
Anyone else
tries to kill him,

88
00:07:35,115 --> 00:07:37,884
I'll have
an arrow for them.

89
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:44,323
And not one of your bald friends is
fast enough to stop me.

90
00:08:05,446 --> 00:08:10,316
And what is it that couldn't wait
until morning, Tarly?

91
00:08:10,350 --> 00:08:12,485
Maester Aemon.

92
00:08:12,519 --> 00:08:15,054
- How did you know--
- That it was you?

93
00:08:15,088 --> 00:08:17,657
Who else
but Samwell Tarly

94
00:08:17,691 --> 00:08:19,592
would be wasting candles

95
00:08:19,626 --> 00:08:22,261
to read in the middle
of the night?

96
00:08:25,833 --> 00:08:28,367
- Let me help you.
- Oh, no need.

97
00:08:29,670 --> 00:08:31,771
I know my way
around this library

98
00:08:31,805 --> 00:08:34,373
better than any other
place in Castle Black.

99
00:08:34,408 --> 00:08:36,709
Thousands of books

100
00:08:36,743 --> 00:08:39,045
and no eyes to read them.

101
00:08:39,079 --> 00:08:43,115
Old age is a wonderful
source of ironies

102
00:08:43,150 --> 00:08:45,318
if nothing else.

103
00:08:45,352 --> 00:08:47,854
But you didn't
answer my question.

104
00:08:47,888 --> 00:08:49,489
What are you reading?

105
00:08:49,523 --> 00:08:51,891
Maester Faull.

106
00:08:51,925 --> 00:08:54,894
Ah, the wildlings.

107
00:08:54,928 --> 00:08:58,498
I can assure you that
the closest Maester Faull

108
00:08:58,532 --> 00:09:01,901
ever got to a wildling
was this very library.

109
00:09:01,935 --> 00:09:04,871
But what he says
about what they do,

110
00:09:04,905 --> 00:09:06,372
it's all true.

111
00:09:06,406 --> 00:09:10,109
It's exactly what the survivors
of their raids report.

112
00:09:10,143 --> 00:09:14,981
Yes, imagine the stories
wildlings tell about us.

113
00:09:16,517 --> 00:09:19,418
Love is the death
of duty.

114
00:09:20,687 --> 00:09:23,189
I told that to your friend
Jon Snow once.

115
00:09:23,223 --> 00:09:27,460
He didn't listen
and neither did you.

116
00:09:27,494 --> 00:09:31,464
Which is why you've abandoned
your watch atop the Wall

117
00:09:31,498 --> 00:09:35,434
to come here and read
about the terrible things

118
00:09:35,469 --> 00:09:39,605
that may have happened
to the girl you love.

119
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:42,642
I don't love her.

120
00:09:42,676 --> 00:09:44,610
- Yes, you do.
- No.

121
00:09:44,645 --> 00:09:46,345
Yes, you do.

122
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:50,550
Heard it in your voice
when you first brought her to me.

123
00:09:50,584 --> 00:09:52,818
I remember how it sounds.

124
00:09:52,853 --> 00:09:54,820
I was in love once.

125
00:09:54,855 --> 00:09:56,122
You were?

126
00:09:56,156 --> 00:10:00,459
You can imagine
all manner of horrors

127
00:10:00,494 --> 00:10:03,162
befalling that poor
girl and her child.

128
00:10:03,196 --> 00:10:05,932
Is it so difficult
to imagine

129
00:10:05,966 --> 00:10:07,867
that an old person
was once,

130
00:10:07,901 --> 00:10:10,069
more or less,
like you?

131
00:10:10,103 --> 00:10:12,738
I'm sorry, Maester.

132
00:10:12,773 --> 00:10:14,507
I didn't mean it
like that.

133
00:10:14,541 --> 00:10:18,411
Do you know who I was
before I came here?

134
00:10:18,445 --> 00:10:22,481
What I could have been
if I'd only said the word?

135
00:10:24,017 --> 00:10:25,818
Of course you do.

136
00:10:25,852 --> 00:10:29,589
I met many girls
when I was Aemon Targaryen.

137
00:10:29,623 --> 00:10:33,492
A future king
always does.

138
00:10:34,528 --> 00:10:37,129
Some of them
were quite forward

139
00:10:37,164 --> 00:10:39,865
in their attempts
to win my affections.

140
00:10:41,034 --> 00:10:43,302
One of them succeeded.

141
00:10:44,304 --> 00:10:46,238
I was very young.

142
00:10:46,273 --> 00:10:48,874
Who was she?

143
00:10:48,909 --> 00:10:50,843
Ah.

144
00:10:50,877 --> 00:10:53,446
I could tell you
everything about her.

145
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:55,348
Who she was,

146
00:10:55,382 --> 00:10:57,149
how we met,

147
00:10:57,184 --> 00:10:59,318
the color of her eyes,

148
00:10:59,353 --> 00:11:02,088
and the shape
of her nose.

149
00:11:03,991 --> 00:11:06,158
I can see her

150
00:11:06,193 --> 00:11:09,028
right in front of me.

151
00:11:10,897 --> 00:11:14,467
She's more real
than you are.

152
00:11:17,571 --> 00:11:21,907
We could spend all night
trading tales of lost loves.

153
00:11:21,942 --> 00:11:24,744
Nothing makes the past
a sweeter place to visit

154
00:11:24,778 --> 00:11:27,913
than the prospect
of imminent death.

155
00:11:27,948 --> 00:11:30,282
Go to bed, Tarly.

156
00:11:36,289 --> 00:11:38,858
<i>Sorry, I can't open the gate</i>
<i>for anybody. Orders.</i>

157
00:11:38,892 --> 00:11:41,160
<i>You don't understand.</i>
<i>They killed everyone.</i>

158
00:11:41,194 --> 00:11:43,262
<i>Everyone but me</i>
<i>and my baby.</i>

159
00:11:43,296 --> 00:11:45,665
<i>They're out there.</i>
<i>I saw them on my way here.</i>

160
00:11:45,699 --> 00:11:47,940
<i>They may have seen me.</i>
<i>They may have followed me. Please.</i>

161
00:11:47,968 --> 00:11:49,368
<i>I'm sorry, I can't.</i>

162
00:11:49,403 --> 00:11:50,770
<i>If they find us out here,</i>
<i>you don't know...</i>

163
00:11:50,804 --> 00:11:52,605
Pyp!
Open the gate.

164
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:55,341
- I can't.
- Sam, is that you?

165
00:11:55,375 --> 00:11:57,510
Yes.

166
00:11:57,544 --> 00:11:59,578
Thorne gave me strict
orders to not open the gate.

167
00:11:59,613 --> 00:12:02,214
Oh, Pyp,
open the fucking gate!

168
00:12:03,684 --> 00:12:05,284
I never heard you
curse before.

169
00:12:05,318 --> 00:12:07,386
Yes, well,
best get used to it.

170
00:12:13,427 --> 00:12:15,327
Are you all right?

171
00:12:17,297 --> 00:12:19,865
Shh, you're all right.

172
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:23,803
Of course you are,
my brave little fella.

173
00:12:23,837 --> 00:12:26,505
- It was horrible.
- I'm so, so sorry.

174
00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:28,340
I didn't know
until I got back.

175
00:12:28,375 --> 00:12:29,842
Don't let them
send me away, Sam.

176
00:12:29,876 --> 00:12:31,744
- Never.
- I know there's no women allowed.

177
00:12:31,778 --> 00:12:35,247
Anyone who tries to throw you out
will be having words with me.

178
00:12:35,282 --> 00:12:38,284
From now on,
wherever you go,

179
00:12:38,318 --> 00:12:40,820
I go, too.

180
00:12:50,897 --> 00:12:52,732
<i>Get ready!</i>

181
00:12:52,766 --> 00:12:54,934
- <i>Man the gate!</i>
- <i>Ready yourselves!</i>

182
00:12:54,968 --> 00:12:57,036
<i>Make haste!</i>

183
00:12:57,070 --> 00:12:59,171
- <i>Prepare!</i>
- <i>Up on the Wall!</i>

184
00:12:59,206 --> 00:13:00,740
<i>Quickly!</i>
<i>Up! Up!</i>

185
00:13:00,774 --> 00:13:03,976
<i>How many? How many are there?</i>

186
00:13:06,313 --> 00:13:08,180
Beyond the trees!

187
00:13:12,018 --> 00:13:14,120
It's time.

188
00:14:01,368 --> 00:14:03,803
Light them up!
Light them all!

189
00:14:13,446 --> 00:14:15,247
Move!

190
00:14:17,884 --> 00:14:19,218
Pick up the pace!

191
00:14:19,252 --> 00:14:21,287
<i>Come on, come on.</i>

192
00:14:27,961 --> 00:14:30,529
Here we go, boys,
there's one.

193
00:14:30,564 --> 00:14:33,732
Let's go.
There's two.

194
00:14:36,837 --> 00:14:38,838
Let's get the next load.

195
00:14:41,741 --> 00:14:44,276
That's the last
of the oil, Ser Alliser.

196
00:14:45,579 --> 00:14:48,380
100,000 you say?

197
00:14:48,415 --> 00:14:50,583
Yes, Ser.

198
00:14:50,617 --> 00:14:52,918
You can say it
if you like.

199
00:14:52,953 --> 00:14:56,822
We should have sealed
the tunnel while we had the chance,

200
00:14:56,857 --> 00:15:00,226
like you suggested.

201
00:15:00,260 --> 00:15:03,495
It was a difficult
decision either way, Ser.

202
00:15:05,665 --> 00:15:09,301
Do you know what leadership
means, Lord Snow?

203
00:15:09,336 --> 00:15:12,404
It means that the person in
charge gets second-guessed

204
00:15:12,439 --> 00:15:15,040
by every clever little
twat with a mouth.

205
00:15:15,075 --> 00:15:17,443
But if he starts
second-guessing himself,

206
00:15:17,477 --> 00:15:19,278
that's the end--

207
00:15:19,312 --> 00:15:22,748
for him, for the clever
little twats,

208
00:15:22,782 --> 00:15:24,483
for everyone.

209
00:15:24,517 --> 00:15:27,486
This is not the end.
Not for us.

210
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:29,655
Not if you lot
do your duty

211
00:15:29,689 --> 00:15:32,224
for however long it takes
to beat them back.

212
00:15:33,693 --> 00:15:36,929
And then you get
to go on hating me

213
00:15:36,963 --> 00:15:38,597
and I get
to go on wishing

214
00:15:38,632 --> 00:15:41,100
your wildling whore
had finished the job.

215
00:16:04,324 --> 00:16:05,925
<i>You'll be safe</i>
<i>down here.</i>

216
00:16:05,959 --> 00:16:07,860
I'll check on you
as soon as I can.

217
00:16:07,894 --> 00:16:10,829
You're leaving me again?

218
00:16:11,898 --> 00:16:13,532
I'm not leaving you.

219
00:16:13,566 --> 00:16:16,335
You're going up there and we're
staying down here. That's leaving.

220
00:16:16,369 --> 00:16:18,737
You said from now on
we'd stay together.

221
00:16:18,772 --> 00:16:21,774
I didn't mean
in the same room.

222
00:16:21,808 --> 00:16:23,108
What are you going
to do out there?

223
00:16:23,143 --> 00:16:24,510
- Help my brothers.
- How?

224
00:16:25,979 --> 00:16:28,180
You're going to fight the free folk
when they come?

225
00:16:28,214 --> 00:16:31,050
They'll kill you.
In Mole's Town, they killed everyone.

226
00:16:31,084 --> 00:16:34,687
I can't just hide here with you
while they're fighting out there.

227
00:16:34,721 --> 00:16:37,556
Why not?
You won't matter up there.

228
00:16:37,590 --> 00:16:39,224
You will down here.

229
00:16:40,493 --> 00:16:43,495
I am a man of
the Night's Watch, Gilly.

230
00:16:43,530 --> 00:16:45,798
I made a promise
to defend the Wall

231
00:16:45,832 --> 00:16:47,666
and I have to keep it

232
00:16:47,701 --> 00:16:50,269
because that's
what men do.

233
00:17:02,449 --> 00:17:05,117
Promise me
you won't die.

234
00:17:07,754 --> 00:17:11,323
I promise you
I won't die.

235
00:17:45,225 --> 00:17:48,527
There's a lot more wildlings on the
other side of the Wall than this side.

236
00:17:48,561 --> 00:17:51,663
We've got loads
of weapons and things.

237
00:17:51,698 --> 00:17:53,599
It's the perfect place
for us to be.

238
00:17:53,633 --> 00:17:55,834
I've never thrown
a spear before.

239
00:17:55,869 --> 00:17:58,737
I've never held a sword
with a proper edge.

240
00:17:58,772 --> 00:18:01,440
This is no place
for me to be.

241
00:18:03,376 --> 00:18:04,810
You're not afraid?

242
00:18:04,844 --> 00:18:07,312
Of course I'm afraid.

243
00:18:07,347 --> 00:18:09,848
There's a band of wildlings
coming to kill us.

244
00:18:09,883 --> 00:18:11,316
If you're afraid
of a band of wildlings,

245
00:18:11,351 --> 00:18:14,620
how in seven hells did you
manage to kill a white walker?

246
00:18:20,093 --> 00:18:22,761
I didn't know
I was going to kill it.

247
00:18:22,796 --> 00:18:25,531
But I had to do something.
I didn't have any choice.

248
00:18:25,565 --> 00:18:27,566
It was going to kill Gilly
and take the baby.

249
00:18:29,569 --> 00:18:32,838
If someone had asked
me my name right then,

250
00:18:32,872 --> 00:18:34,573
I wouldn't have known.

251
00:18:36,309 --> 00:18:39,278
I wasn't
Samwell Tarly anymore.

252
00:18:39,312 --> 00:18:42,047
I wasn't a steward
in the Night's Watch

253
00:18:42,082 --> 00:18:44,817
or son of Randyll Tarly
or any of that.

254
00:18:46,052 --> 00:18:48,153
I was nothing at all.

255
00:18:50,023 --> 00:18:51,990
And when you're
nothing at all,

256
00:18:52,025 --> 00:18:54,660
there's no more reason
to be afraid.

257
00:18:56,463 --> 00:18:58,464
But you're afraid now?

258
00:18:59,332 --> 00:19:00,966
Yes, well...

259
00:19:02,836 --> 00:19:04,937
I'm not nothing anymore.

260
00:19:24,190 --> 00:19:25,591
Most of their men
are up top.

261
00:19:25,625 --> 00:19:27,605
Didn't count more
than 20 down here.

262
00:19:27,630 --> 00:19:28,994
Leftovers.

263
00:19:28,995 --> 00:19:31,063
They got a big fat one and
a little bony one manning the front.

264
00:19:31,097 --> 00:19:32,598
How high are the walls?

265
00:19:32,632 --> 00:19:34,992
Well, we'll be up and over before they
know what's happened.

266
00:19:36,636 --> 00:19:39,371
Let's kill some crows!

267
00:19:41,374 --> 00:19:43,742
Come on!

268
00:20:00,293 --> 00:20:02,895
<i>Come on, brothers!</i>

269
00:21:18,171 --> 00:21:19,671
Archers nock.

270
00:21:19,706 --> 00:21:21,907
Everyone else hold.

271
00:21:21,941 --> 00:21:24,409
Grenn, no!

272
00:21:27,313 --> 00:21:30,249
I said nock and hold,
you cunts!

273
00:21:30,283 --> 00:21:33,318
- Does nock mean draw?
- No, Ser!

274
00:21:33,353 --> 00:21:36,622
- Does fucking hold mean fucking drop?
- No, Ser!

275
00:21:36,656 --> 00:21:39,858
- You all plan to die here tonight?
- No, Ser!

276
00:21:39,892 --> 00:21:42,361
That's very good to hear.
Draw!

277
00:21:46,633 --> 00:21:48,667
No, down below!

278
00:21:58,344 --> 00:22:00,812
Draw!
Light them up.

279
00:22:15,261 --> 00:22:17,963
Come on, get up!

280
00:22:17,997 --> 00:22:19,831
They're attacking
the southern gate!

281
00:22:19,866 --> 00:22:22,000
<i>- Now?</i>
- Now.

282
00:22:25,338 --> 00:22:29,074
I'm going down there.
Brother Slynt, you have the Wall.

283
00:22:29,108 --> 00:22:31,643
What?

284
00:22:31,678 --> 00:22:34,880
What are you fucking waiting for?
Loose!

285
00:22:34,914 --> 00:22:38,383
You heard the man.
Loose!

286
00:23:15,521 --> 00:23:17,055
You, over there.

287
00:23:21,961 --> 00:23:24,096
- Did you get one?
- No.

288
00:23:25,598 --> 00:23:27,766
Ah, shit, Pyp!
Shit.

289
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:29,434
- Sam.
- Yeah?

290
00:23:29,469 --> 00:23:31,269
I think we're gonna die.

291
00:23:31,304 --> 00:23:33,338
If you keep
missing, we will.

292
00:23:43,182 --> 00:23:45,283
Come on!
Come on!

293
00:23:49,956 --> 00:23:51,656
Brothers!

294
00:23:51,691 --> 00:23:55,260
100 generations
have defended this castle.

295
00:23:55,294 --> 00:23:58,063
She's never fallen before.

296
00:23:58,097 --> 00:23:59,531
She will not fall tonight.

297
00:23:59,565 --> 00:24:02,701
Those are Thenns
at our walls.

298
00:24:02,735 --> 00:24:05,036
They eat the flesh
of the men they kill.

299
00:24:05,071 --> 00:24:08,240
Do you want to fill
the belly of a Thenn tonight?

300
00:24:08,274 --> 00:24:09,574
No!

301
00:24:09,609 --> 00:24:11,109
Tonight we fight.

302
00:24:11,144 --> 00:24:13,545
<i>And when the sun rises,</i>
<i>I promise you,</i>

303
00:24:13,579 --> 00:24:15,480
Castle Black will stand!

304
00:24:16,616 --> 00:24:18,817
The Night's Watch
will stand.

305
00:24:22,155 --> 00:24:25,624
With me now!
Now with me!

306
00:25:21,681 --> 00:25:24,316
No discipline.
No training.

307
00:25:24,350 --> 00:25:27,152
Gang of thieves,
that's all this is.

308
00:25:27,186 --> 00:25:29,955
<i>I commanded the City Watch</i>
<i>of King's Landing.</i>

309
00:25:29,989 --> 00:25:31,857
<i>Those men obeyed orders.</i>

310
00:25:31,891 --> 00:25:33,692
We can't just let
them attack the gate!

311
00:25:33,726 --> 00:25:37,062
The bars of those gates
are four inches of cold-rolled steel.

312
00:25:37,096 --> 00:25:39,564
Those are giants riding
mammoths down there!

313
00:25:39,599 --> 00:25:42,067
Do you think your cold-rolled steel
is gonna stop them?

314
00:25:42,101 --> 00:25:43,368
No such thing
as giants.

315
00:25:43,402 --> 00:25:46,104
<i>A story</i>
<i>for the children.</i>

316
00:25:48,007 --> 00:25:49,875
Brother Slynt.

317
00:25:49,909 --> 00:25:52,711
We just got word
that Ser Alliser needs you below.

318
00:25:54,580 --> 00:25:57,749
You're the most experienced man
he's got, Ser, and he needs you.

319
00:25:58,684 --> 00:26:00,452
Needed below?

320
00:26:00,486 --> 00:26:02,654
Yes. Yes.

321
00:26:11,831 --> 00:26:15,333
Archers, nock your arrows!

322
00:26:15,368 --> 00:26:17,869
<i>Nock arrows!</i>

323
00:26:17,904 --> 00:26:19,604
Draw!

324
00:26:21,073 --> 00:26:23,241
Loose!

325
00:26:37,123 --> 00:26:39,324
They won't summit
before dawn.

326
00:26:39,358 --> 00:26:40,392
How do you know that?

327
00:26:40,426 --> 00:26:42,494
Because I've made
that climb.

328
00:26:42,528 --> 00:26:45,630
I think they're in a bigger
hurry than you were.

329
00:26:48,367 --> 00:26:50,235
<i>Hold the bridge!</i>

330
00:26:50,269 --> 00:26:52,404
<i>Hold, wait for it!</i>

331
00:26:52,438 --> 00:26:55,273
<i>Come on with the rocks!</i>

332
00:27:00,913 --> 00:27:02,380
Nock!

333
00:27:04,283 --> 00:27:05,750
Draw!

334
00:27:09,422 --> 00:27:10,722
Loose!

335
00:27:29,675 --> 00:27:31,710
Down!

336
00:28:05,811 --> 00:28:08,313
No! No!

337
00:28:27,333 --> 00:28:28,933
To the gate.
Come on, let's move.

338
00:28:32,972 --> 00:28:34,272
It's gonna open.

339
00:29:39,038 --> 00:29:41,406
I got one right through the heart.
He's dead.

340
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:43,842
- Oh, is it over?
- No.

341
00:29:43,876 --> 00:29:45,744
Well, then...

342
00:29:53,252 --> 00:29:56,321
You're all right.
You're all right.

343
00:29:58,624 --> 00:30:00,792
I'll get help.

344
00:30:00,826 --> 00:30:02,560
Shh. Shh.

345
00:30:02,595 --> 00:30:04,896
Maester Aemon is coming.

346
00:30:04,930 --> 00:30:06,865
He's gonna make
it all right.

347
00:30:06,899 --> 00:30:10,201
Shh. Shh.

348
00:30:18,344 --> 00:30:20,979
- Now.
- Now!

349
00:31:54,006 --> 00:31:55,740
The outer gate
won't hold.

350
00:31:55,774 --> 00:31:58,710
Take five men,
hold the inner gate.

351
00:31:58,744 --> 00:32:00,144
Aye.

352
00:32:02,648 --> 00:32:04,482
Hold the gate.

353
00:32:04,516 --> 00:32:06,818
If they make it through...

354
00:32:09,088 --> 00:32:10,989
They won't.

355
00:32:13,025 --> 00:32:15,693
Come on, Hill.
And you, Cooper.

356
00:32:15,728 --> 00:32:18,897
You three, on me.

357
00:32:18,931 --> 00:32:21,232
Come on,
you lazy bastards.

358
00:32:25,104 --> 00:32:27,105
Oil.

359
00:32:28,107 --> 00:32:30,241
Oil on the ramp!

360
00:32:39,385 --> 00:32:41,653
Protect the gate!

361
00:33:14,687 --> 00:33:16,554
Get him inside.

362
00:33:20,659 --> 00:33:22,760
Hold the fucking gate!

363
00:33:22,795 --> 00:33:24,929
Hold it!

364
00:34:23,422 --> 00:34:24,922
We need more men
down here.

365
00:34:24,957 --> 00:34:27,458
- We have to hold the gate.
- But we need men here.

366
00:34:27,493 --> 00:34:29,761
Tell Jon.
He's in command.

367
00:34:29,795 --> 00:34:32,196
Let's go.

368
00:34:39,838 --> 00:34:43,007
Get me to the top!
You hear me?!

369
00:34:47,513 --> 00:34:49,914
Your name's Olly, right?

370
00:34:49,948 --> 00:34:53,184
Listen to me, Olly.
Get me to the top.

371
00:34:53,218 --> 00:34:56,220
And when we give the signal,
bring us back down.

372
00:34:57,389 --> 00:34:58,990
You hear me?

373
00:35:03,562 --> 00:35:06,230
Find a weapon, Olly.
Fight them.

374
00:35:39,031 --> 00:35:41,165
Clear the way!
Let's go!

375
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:43,334
- Out of the way!
- Get out of here!

376
00:36:00,752 --> 00:36:03,187
Cut the rope!

377
00:36:09,328 --> 00:36:11,863
Wait! No!

378
00:36:25,878 --> 00:36:27,912
- <i>We need more archers.</i>
- <i>Here I am.</i>

379
00:36:27,946 --> 00:36:30,281
- <i>Come on.</i>
- <i>Quickly.</i>

380
00:36:32,484 --> 00:36:34,418
What are you
doing up here?

381
00:36:34,453 --> 00:36:36,954
The wildlings
are over the walls.

382
00:36:36,989 --> 00:36:38,789
Ser Alliser's fallen.

383
00:36:38,824 --> 00:36:41,492
The castle won't stand
much longer.

384
00:36:43,195 --> 00:36:46,164
Edd, you have the Wall.

385
00:36:48,433 --> 00:36:50,902
If they try the mammoths
again, drop fire on them.

386
00:36:50,936 --> 00:36:53,704
If the climbers get too high,
drop the scythe on them.

387
00:36:59,211 --> 00:37:02,413
Come, brothers.
Now fight with me!

388
00:37:02,447 --> 00:37:06,284
Might as well enjoy
our last night, right, boys?

389
00:37:06,351 --> 00:37:08,286
Light the fuckers up!

390
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:11,455
<i>Nock! Draw!</i>

391
00:37:12,391 --> 00:37:14,625
Loose!

392
00:37:23,235 --> 00:37:24,368
How are we
gonna stop that?

393
00:37:24,403 --> 00:37:25,703
Shot 20 arrows
in him already.

394
00:37:25,737 --> 00:37:27,171
You heard Jon.
We hold the gate.

395
00:37:27,206 --> 00:37:28,639
Jon Snow's not
Lord Commander.

396
00:37:28,674 --> 00:37:30,341
We hold the gate!

397
00:37:39,218 --> 00:37:41,719
Mother, save me.
Father, save me.

398
00:37:41,753 --> 00:37:42,954
The gods aren't down here.

399
00:37:42,988 --> 00:37:44,622
It's the six of us.
You hear me?

400
00:37:50,562 --> 00:37:53,264
Night gathers
and now my watch begins.

401
00:37:53,298 --> 00:37:55,700
<i>It shall not end</i>
<i>until my death.</i>

402
00:37:55,734 --> 00:37:58,202
I shall take no wife,
hold no lands,

403
00:37:58,237 --> 00:37:59,837
<i>father no children.</i>

404
00:37:59,871 --> 00:38:02,406
I shall wear no crown
and win no glory.

405
00:38:02,441 --> 00:38:04,642
I shall live and die
at my post.

406
00:38:04,676 --> 00:38:06,544
I am the sword
in the darkness.

407
00:38:06,578 --> 00:38:08,379
I am the watcher
on the walls.

408
00:38:08,413 --> 00:38:11,382
I am the shield that guards
the realms of men.

409
00:38:11,416 --> 00:38:15,453
I pledge my life and honor
to the Night's Watch

410
00:38:15,487 --> 00:38:18,155
for this night
and all the nights to come!

411
00:38:23,929 --> 00:38:25,363
I don't want you
out there.

412
00:38:25,397 --> 00:38:27,632
You can't
protect me forever.

413
00:38:27,666 --> 00:38:30,268
There won't be anywhere
to hide if the castle falls.

414
00:38:33,071 --> 00:38:35,640
I need him
more than I need you.

415
00:39:49,114 --> 00:39:51,682
We need you, boy.

416
00:40:13,772 --> 00:40:15,473
Ha!

417
00:42:10,522 --> 00:42:12,056
Jon Snow.

418
00:42:12,090 --> 00:42:15,359
Hush.
Don't talk.

419
00:42:19,464 --> 00:42:21,932
Do you remember the cave?

420
00:42:26,371 --> 00:42:29,173
We should have
stayed in the cave.

421
00:42:33,144 --> 00:42:35,145
We'll go back there.

422
00:42:41,219 --> 00:42:44,555
You know nothing,
Jon Snow.

423
00:43:19,791 --> 00:43:22,226
Drop the scythe, boys!

424
00:43:44,382 --> 00:43:46,884
- Hoist her up.
<i>- Hoist her up!</i>

425
00:43:52,791 --> 00:43:54,892
They've had enough
for one night.

426
00:43:59,030 --> 00:44:01,398
Don't cheer too loud.

427
00:44:02,767 --> 00:44:05,803
They still outnumber us
1,000 to one.

428
00:44:14,112 --> 00:44:15,846
Tormund.

429
00:44:15,880 --> 00:44:18,449
It's over.

430
00:44:18,483 --> 00:44:19,817
Let it end.

431
00:44:19,851 --> 00:44:22,152
This is how a man ends.

432
00:44:30,128 --> 00:44:31,662
Put him in chains.

433
00:44:32,764 --> 00:44:34,598
We'll question him later.

434
00:44:37,302 --> 00:44:39,703
I should have
thrown you

435
00:44:39,738 --> 00:44:42,740
from the top
of the Wall, boy!

436
00:44:42,774 --> 00:44:44,808
Aye.

437
00:44:44,843 --> 00:44:46,877
You should have.

438
00:44:54,019 --> 00:44:56,687
Whoa, it's me.
It's me.

439
00:45:00,525 --> 00:45:02,359
I promised you,
didn't I?

440
00:45:17,342 --> 00:45:19,043
We held them off.

441
00:45:19,077 --> 00:45:21,045
For one night.

442
00:45:21,079 --> 00:45:23,414
This is a great
victory.

443
00:45:23,448 --> 00:45:25,616
A great victory?

444
00:45:27,185 --> 00:45:29,420
Mance was testing
our defenses.

445
00:45:29,454 --> 00:45:31,055
He almost
made it through.

446
00:45:31,089 --> 00:45:33,891
And he has more giants.
He has more mammoths.

447
00:45:33,925 --> 00:45:36,660
He has 1,000 times
as many men.

448
00:45:39,998 --> 00:45:42,566
They'll hit us
again tonight.

449
00:45:42,600 --> 00:45:45,035
Maybe we can hold them
off for a day or two,

450
00:45:45,070 --> 00:45:46,837
but we'll never
beat them.

451
00:45:48,039 --> 00:45:49,406
Where are we going?

452
00:45:49,441 --> 00:45:51,108
Going to find Mance.

453
00:45:51,142 --> 00:45:53,844
To fi---
you can't do that.

454
00:45:53,878 --> 00:45:55,746
<i>No one gave you</i>
<i>any orders.</i>

455
00:45:57,482 --> 00:45:59,883
Who's left
to give orders?

456
00:45:59,918 --> 00:46:02,653
The wildling army's only
an army because of Mance.

457
00:46:02,687 --> 00:46:05,422
He united
100 warring tribes.

458
00:46:05,457 --> 00:46:07,491
Without Mance,
they lose their leader.

459
00:46:07,525 --> 00:46:10,227
They lose their purpose.
They go back to fighting each other.

460
00:46:10,261 --> 00:46:12,062
Scatter back
to their homes.

461
00:46:12,097 --> 00:46:14,264
Without Mance?

462
00:46:14,299 --> 00:46:15,733
You're going to kill him?

463
00:46:15,767 --> 00:46:17,067
I'm gonna try.

464
00:46:17,102 --> 00:46:18,936
They'll never let you
within 100 yards of him.

465
00:46:18,970 --> 00:46:21,171
And even if they did,
even if you managed to kill him--

466
00:46:21,206 --> 00:46:23,774
They'll kill me?
If I don't go, they'll kill me anyway.

467
00:46:23,808 --> 00:46:25,242
They'll kill
the rest of us, too.

468
00:46:25,276 --> 00:46:27,811
<i>They won't just kill you.</i>

469
00:46:27,846 --> 00:46:29,713
They'll boil you.
They'll flay you.

470
00:46:29,748 --> 00:46:31,248
They'll make it last days.

471
00:46:34,052 --> 00:46:37,588
You're right.
It's a bad plan.

472
00:46:39,591 --> 00:46:41,625
What's your plan?

473
00:47:24,869 --> 00:47:27,070
They held the gate.

474
00:47:36,281 --> 00:47:38,849
Get some brothers
down here to help you.

475
00:47:40,985 --> 00:47:43,287
We need to burn
the bodies.

476
00:48:04,108 --> 00:48:07,110
Raise the outer gate.

477
00:48:07,145 --> 00:48:09,680
Then lower it again
as soon as I'm out.

478
00:48:21,092 --> 00:48:22,593
What are you doing?

479
00:48:22,627 --> 00:48:25,329
I promised Mormont
I'd never lose it again.

480
00:48:29,667 --> 00:48:31,835
In case I don't come back.

481
00:48:39,644 --> 00:48:41,678
Jon.

482
00:48:46,351 --> 00:48:48,118
Come back.
