00:02:14,403 --> 00:02:16,437
Here we are.

6
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:26,381
Ready?

7
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:33,555
"The Rains of Castamere."

8
00:02:33,589 --> 00:02:35,657
You fucking deaf?

9
00:02:35,691 --> 00:02:37,959
Same wrong guess
every fucking time.

10
00:02:37,993 --> 00:02:39,394
Listen, you cunt.

11
00:02:39,428 --> 00:02:41,596
Oh!

12
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,534
"The Bear
and the Maiden Fair."

13
00:02:48,504 --> 00:02:50,238
There's a man
with an ear.

14
00:02:50,272 --> 00:02:52,674
Too bad you got
a hangnail for a cock.

15
00:02:54,643 --> 00:02:56,611
First time I saw you
with your breeches down,

16
00:02:56,645 --> 00:02:58,313
I thought you were
a eunuch.

17
00:02:58,347 --> 00:03:00,882
You've seen it, girls.

18
00:03:00,916 --> 00:03:03,852
Like a baby snail
peeking out of his shell.

19
00:03:17,933 --> 00:03:20,235
Your baby was crying
this morning.

20
00:03:25,741 --> 00:03:28,176
Woke me up.

21
00:03:28,210 --> 00:03:29,878
You hear me?

22
00:03:29,912 --> 00:03:31,379
Yes.

23
00:03:31,413 --> 00:03:33,815
Well, got
anything to say?

24
00:03:33,849 --> 00:03:35,850
I'm sorry
he woke you up.

25
00:03:35,885 --> 00:03:39,053
I don't care if you're sorry.

26
00:03:39,088 --> 00:03:41,823
Keep that baby quiet

27
00:03:41,857 --> 00:03:43,625
or I will.

28
00:03:43,659 --> 00:03:45,226
Don't you
ever touch him.

29
00:03:47,196 --> 00:03:49,530
Little wildling bitch.

30
00:03:49,565 --> 00:03:52,600
<i>You should have stayed</i>
<i>with your own kind.</i>

31
00:03:54,603 --> 00:03:56,404
<i>You listening to me?</i>

32
00:03:56,438 --> 00:03:58,439
- Shut your mouth.
- What?

33
00:04:00,809 --> 00:04:03,311
It's just an owl,
you dumb bitch.

34
00:04:03,345 --> 00:04:05,613
No, it's not.

35
00:05:42,811 --> 00:05:45,780
Shh.

36
00:05:53,588 --> 00:05:55,756
I should never
have left her there.

37
00:05:55,791 --> 00:05:59,393
- You couldn't have known.
- Of course I could've known.

38
00:05:59,428 --> 00:06:01,962
They've been raiding
the villages close by.

39
00:06:01,997 --> 00:06:04,799
And we just cower in here
while they slaughter our brothers.

40
00:06:04,833 --> 00:06:06,634
Our brothers had orders
to stay at Castle Black.

41
00:06:06,668 --> 00:06:09,236
So it's all right, then?
Black Jack and Kegs

42
00:06:09,271 --> 00:06:11,138
and Mully chopped to pieces
'cause they broke the rules?

43
00:06:11,173 --> 00:06:12,673
<i>I didn't say it</i>
<i>was all right.</i>

44
00:06:12,708 --> 00:06:14,375
I'm saying they shouldn't
have been there.

45
00:06:14,409 --> 00:06:16,911
We're pledged to guard
the realms of men.

46
00:06:16,945 --> 00:06:18,412
She's dead because of me.

47
00:06:18,447 --> 00:06:19,980
We can't even guard
Mole's Town.

48
00:06:20,015 --> 00:06:21,582
We can't go after them.
You know that.

49
00:06:21,616 --> 00:06:23,050
It's what they want.

50
00:06:23,085 --> 00:06:25,419
And little Sam.

51
00:06:25,454 --> 00:06:28,456
As if I cut
their throats myself.

52
00:06:28,490 --> 00:06:29,824
Maybe she managed
to hide herself.

53
00:06:29,858 --> 00:06:31,759
<i>I thought</i>
<i>all of you was dead.</i>

54
00:06:31,793 --> 00:06:34,061
You went north with Mormont
and no one came back.

55
00:06:34,096 --> 00:06:36,130
Not for ages.

56
00:06:36,164 --> 00:06:38,032
But then you did.

57
00:06:39,735 --> 00:06:41,435
She survived Craster

58
00:06:41,470 --> 00:06:44,004
and he was the worst
shit I've ever met.

59
00:06:44,039 --> 00:06:45,706
She survived the long march
to the Wall.

60
00:06:45,741 --> 00:06:49,577
<i>She survived a white walker,</i>
<i>for fuck's sake.</i>

61
00:06:50,912 --> 00:06:52,279
She might have got out.

62
00:06:54,683 --> 00:06:57,017
She might have.

63
00:06:58,353 --> 00:07:00,721
If they hit Mole's Town,

64
00:07:00,756 --> 00:07:02,823
then we're next.

65
00:07:05,827 --> 00:07:07,828
Mance and his army
must be close.

66
00:07:07,863 --> 00:07:09,530
<i>100,000 of them.</i>

67
00:07:09,564 --> 00:07:12,066
And there's what,
105 of us left?

68
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:14,769
You counting Black Jack,
Kegs, and Mully?

69
00:07:16,638 --> 00:07:17,905
102.

70
00:07:17,939 --> 00:07:21,041
How do 102 men
stop 100,0?

71
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:27,548
Whoever dies last,
be a good lad

72
00:07:27,582 --> 00:07:30,017
<i>and burn the rest of us.</i>

73
00:07:30,051 --> 00:07:32,653
Once I'm done
with this world,

74
00:07:32,687 --> 00:07:35,156
I don't want
to come back.

75
00:08:35,650 --> 00:08:37,918
<i>You think he was</i>
<i>spying on you?</i>

76
00:08:37,953 --> 00:08:39,553
<i>No, not spying.</i>

77
00:08:39,588 --> 00:08:41,856
<i>The Dothraki think</i>
<i>outsiders are ridiculous</i>

78
00:08:41,890 --> 00:08:43,357
taking shame
in the naked body.

79
00:08:43,391 --> 00:08:46,727
They make love under the stars
for the whole khalasar to see.

80
00:08:48,263 --> 00:08:50,431
Yes, Your Grace.

81
00:08:50,465 --> 00:08:52,766
But you are not
Dothraki.

82
00:08:52,801 --> 00:08:54,768
No.

83
00:08:56,271 --> 00:08:58,138
Well, I don't see
why it matters.

84
00:08:58,173 --> 00:08:59,406
Grey Worm
isn't interested.

85
00:08:59,441 --> 00:09:01,909
None of the Unsullied care
what's under our clothes.

86
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:07,281
He was interested.

87
00:09:07,315 --> 00:09:09,884
What?

88
00:09:11,186 --> 00:09:14,388
I believe he was
interested.

89
00:09:16,191 --> 00:09:18,259
When the slavers
castrate the boys,

90
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:20,027
do they take all of it?

91
00:09:20,061 --> 00:09:22,129
All of it?

92
00:09:22,163 --> 00:09:24,098
The--

93
00:09:24,132 --> 00:09:26,901
the pillar
and the stones.

94
00:09:29,538 --> 00:09:31,639
I don't know,
Your Grace.

95
00:09:31,673 --> 00:09:34,408
Haven't you
ever wondered?

96
00:09:37,646 --> 00:09:40,247
Yes, Your Grace.

97
00:09:57,599 --> 00:09:59,600
<i>Missandei.</i>

98
00:10:15,584 --> 00:10:18,052
The lessons you give I
in common tongue...

99
00:10:20,755 --> 00:10:22,923
these are precious to I.

100
00:10:22,958 --> 00:10:25,192
- To me.
- To me.

101
00:10:25,226 --> 00:10:28,395
I don't remember teaching
you the word precious.

102
00:10:28,430 --> 00:10:31,498
Jorah the Andal,
he teaches I--

103
00:10:31,533 --> 00:10:34,335
he teaches me
this word.

104
00:10:35,704 --> 00:10:38,038
Do you remember the name
you were given at birth?

105
00:10:38,073 --> 00:10:40,874
I remember nothing.

106
00:10:40,909 --> 00:10:42,776
Only Unsullied.

107
00:10:42,811 --> 00:10:44,812
When they cut you,

108
00:10:44,846 --> 00:10:47,281
do you remember that?

109
00:10:49,484 --> 00:10:51,685
I'm sorry.

110
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:53,954
I'm sorry they did
that to you.

111
00:10:53,989 --> 00:10:56,690
Why?
Why sorry?

112
00:10:56,725 --> 00:10:59,426
It's a terrible thing
to do to a boy.

113
00:11:04,499 --> 00:11:07,001
If the masters
never cut me,

114
00:11:07,035 --> 00:11:09,136
I never am Unsullied.

115
00:11:09,170 --> 00:11:12,306
I never stand in
the Plaza of Pride

116
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:14,908
when Daenerys Stormborn
orders us

117
00:11:14,943 --> 00:11:16,844
to kill the masters.

118
00:11:16,878 --> 00:11:20,648
I never am chosen
to lead the Unsullied.

119
00:11:20,682 --> 00:11:22,950
I never meet Missandei

120
00:11:22,984 --> 00:11:25,285
from the island of Naath.

121
00:11:41,770 --> 00:11:44,238
I am sorry I--

122
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,775
for today.

123
00:11:47,809 --> 00:11:49,943
I am sorry.

124
00:12:35,323 --> 00:12:37,958
Kraken. Mmm.

125
00:12:37,992 --> 00:12:40,627
Strong as long
as they're in the sea.

126
00:12:40,662 --> 00:12:43,363
When you take them
out of the water,

127
00:12:43,398 --> 00:12:44,698
no bones.

128
00:12:44,733 --> 00:12:46,934
They collapse
under their proud weight

129
00:12:46,968 --> 00:12:49,336
and slump into
a heap of nothing.

130
00:12:49,370 --> 00:12:51,605
You'd think
they know that.

131
00:12:51,639 --> 00:12:54,241
Unfortunately,
they're not very bright.

132
00:12:55,810 --> 00:12:57,745
What do you tell them?

133
00:12:57,779 --> 00:13:00,013
I'm Theon Greyjoy,

134
00:13:00,048 --> 00:13:02,816
son of Balon,
heir to the Iron Islands.

135
00:13:02,851 --> 00:13:06,053
- And what are you really?
- I'm Reek.

136
00:13:06,087 --> 00:13:08,088
Are you sure?

137
00:13:09,491 --> 00:13:11,992
You do look very much
like a lord.

138
00:13:12,026 --> 00:13:15,295
Formidable, proud.

139
00:13:16,464 --> 00:13:17,898
I'm Reek.

140
00:13:17,966 --> 00:13:19,767
Until when?

141
00:13:19,801 --> 00:13:21,835
Always.

142
00:13:21,870 --> 00:13:24,104
- Forever.
- That's right.

143
00:13:24,139 --> 00:13:27,508
Until you're rotting
in the ground.

144
00:13:30,245 --> 00:13:34,148
Remember what you are
and what you're not.

145
00:13:34,182 --> 00:13:36,617
Bring me Moat Cailin.

146
00:14:06,681 --> 00:14:08,682
No closer.

147
00:14:11,119 --> 00:14:13,353
Who are you?

148
00:14:51,593 --> 00:14:53,994
I'm Kenning,

149
00:14:54,028 --> 00:14:56,230
commander of
this garrison.

150
00:14:57,999 --> 00:15:00,033
And you say
you're Theon Greyjoy?

151
00:15:00,068 --> 00:15:01,969
Yes.

152
00:15:02,003 --> 00:15:05,072
And why should
I believe that?

153
00:15:05,106 --> 00:15:08,108
I was born on Pyke
to Balon Greyjoy.

154
00:15:08,142 --> 00:15:10,878
His third
and last living son.

155
00:15:10,912 --> 00:15:12,613
I am your prince.

156
00:15:12,647 --> 00:15:14,882
I swear it
by the Drowned God.

157
00:15:14,916 --> 00:15:17,251
What is dead
may never die.

158
00:15:17,285 --> 00:15:19,319
What is dead
may never die.

159
00:15:19,354 --> 00:15:21,622
And if you were
my prince,

160
00:15:21,656 --> 00:15:23,957
why are you marching
with a Bolton army?

161
00:15:23,992 --> 00:15:26,560
Lord Bolton took me
captive after Winterfell.

162
00:15:26,594 --> 00:15:29,563
He sent me to treat
with you in good faith

163
00:15:29,597 --> 00:15:30,998
as your fellow ironborn.

164
00:15:31,032 --> 00:15:32,900
And what does
Lord Bolton want?

165
00:15:35,637 --> 00:15:37,905
You are fading
from sickness,

166
00:15:37,939 --> 00:15:39,406
you are badly outnumbered,

167
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:41,742
and you're hundreds
of miles from the sea.

168
00:15:41,776 --> 00:15:43,677
Lord Bolton implores you
to protect your men

169
00:15:43,711 --> 00:15:47,247
and abandon this fortress
you can no longer hold.

170
00:15:47,282 --> 00:15:50,717
Do this, and he will be
just and fair with you

171
00:15:50,752 --> 00:15:52,653
as he has been with me.

172
00:15:54,589 --> 00:15:57,624
The Boltons will give you safe
passage to the Stony Shore.

173
00:15:57,659 --> 00:15:59,860
He wants us
to surrender?

174
00:15:59,894 --> 00:16:02,629
My own father,
your king,

175
00:16:02,664 --> 00:16:05,966
surrendered years ago
to Robert Baratheon.

176
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,268
I watched him
bend the knee.

177
00:16:08,303 --> 00:16:09,870
There was no shame there.

178
00:16:09,904 --> 00:16:12,606
He fought with honor,
as did you.

179
00:16:16,644 --> 00:16:18,946
"No shame."
"Fought with honor."

180
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:20,847
I'm sorry,
I didn't hear.

181
00:16:23,318 --> 00:16:25,786
"No shame."
"Fought with honor."

182
00:16:29,157 --> 00:16:32,059
Only a whipped dog
would speak this way.

183
00:16:34,362 --> 00:16:35,829
Or a woman.

184
00:16:37,265 --> 00:16:39,066
Are you a woman, boy?

185
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:40,567
You don't know--

186
00:16:40,601 --> 00:16:42,903
The ironborn
will not surrender.

187
00:16:42,937 --> 00:16:44,638
Reek. My name is Reek...

188
00:16:44,672 --> 00:16:46,940
You go tell
your master that,

189
00:16:46,975 --> 00:16:49,242
Theon Greyjoy,

190
00:16:49,277 --> 00:16:51,278
or whoever the fuck
you are.

191
00:16:51,312 --> 00:16:52,980
My name is Reek.

192
00:16:53,014 --> 00:16:54,648
What in the hell
are you muttering?

193
00:16:54,682 --> 00:16:56,550
I'm Reek.

194
00:16:57,852 --> 00:16:59,486
Reek.

195
00:17:06,427 --> 00:17:08,161
If we yield, we live?

196
00:17:08,196 --> 00:17:10,163
Is that what it says
on this paper here?

197
00:17:10,198 --> 00:17:14,468
Yes. Have your men raise the
white flag and open the gates.

198
00:17:14,502 --> 00:17:16,903
You're going home.

199
00:17:23,745 --> 00:17:26,146
<i>You didn't really think</i>
<i>I'd let them go, did you?</i>

200
00:17:26,180 --> 00:17:29,916
It's fallen out
of fashion, flaying.

201
00:17:29,951 --> 00:17:32,185
Sad, but true.

202
00:17:32,253 --> 00:17:34,221
Traditions
are important.

203
00:17:34,255 --> 00:17:36,556
Where are we
without our history?

204
00:17:36,591 --> 00:17:39,059
- Eh?
- Yes, my lord.

205
00:17:39,093 --> 00:17:41,661
Will we go home now?

206
00:17:42,997 --> 00:17:44,798
I believe we will.

207
00:17:44,832 --> 00:17:46,800
To our new home.

208
00:17:57,011 --> 00:17:59,946
<i>You have foreign blood,</i>
<i>don't you, Baelish?</i>

209
00:17:59,981 --> 00:18:03,483
A great-grandfather
from Braavos, yes.

210
00:18:03,518 --> 00:18:06,086
I suppose
all of our ancestors

211
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:08,055
came from somewhere
else originally.

212
00:18:08,089 --> 00:18:10,290
<i>Our forebearers</i>
<i>settled the Vale</i>

213
00:18:10,324 --> 00:18:11,758
<i>thousands of years ago.</i>

214
00:18:11,793 --> 00:18:14,294
<i>We've fought off invaders</i>
<i>ever since.</i>

215
00:18:14,328 --> 00:18:15,829
The beauty of the Vale
is matched only

216
00:18:15,863 --> 00:18:18,231
by the nobility
of its great families.

217
00:18:18,266 --> 00:18:20,367
Lady Arryn often told me

218
00:18:20,401 --> 00:18:23,003
that you were her rock,
Lord Royce.

219
00:18:23,037 --> 00:18:25,839
She told me nothing
about you, Baelish.

220
00:18:25,873 --> 00:18:28,608
But I didn't need
to hear from her.

221
00:18:28,643 --> 00:18:30,777
Moneylender.
Whoremonger.

222
00:18:30,845 --> 00:18:33,814
You've been licking Tywin
Lannister's boots so long,

223
00:18:33,848 --> 00:18:35,782
- it's a wonder your tongue's not black.
- My lord--

224
00:18:35,817 --> 00:18:39,619
And when Jon Arryn named you
Master of Coin, no one cared.

225
00:18:39,654 --> 00:18:41,555
Always been a grubby job.

226
00:18:41,589 --> 00:18:43,790
Why not let
a grubby man do it?

227
00:18:43,825 --> 00:18:46,393
<i>But when I heard</i>
<i>you were lurking here,</i>

228
00:18:46,427 --> 00:18:48,261
fawning over
the Lady Arryn--

229
00:18:48,296 --> 00:18:50,397
Lady Arryn
invited me.

230
00:18:50,431 --> 00:18:53,166
She and I have been
close since childhood.

231
00:18:53,201 --> 00:18:55,769
Yes, we all know
how close you were.

232
00:18:55,803 --> 00:18:58,605
<i>Lady Arryn's predilections</i>
<i>were her own affair.</i>

233
00:18:58,639 --> 00:19:00,273
Her death is our affair.

234
00:19:00,308 --> 00:19:03,076
Of course.
Her suicide shattered us all.

235
00:19:03,111 --> 00:19:05,479
She was an odd fish.

236
00:19:05,513 --> 00:19:08,248
Everyone knew that.
But suicide?

237
00:19:08,282 --> 00:19:11,751
<i>She adored</i>
<i>that boy of hers.</i>

238
00:19:11,786 --> 00:19:14,154
I don't see her abandoning him.
Not by choice.

239
00:19:14,188 --> 00:19:17,324
<i>Strange that within days</i>
<i>of your arrival,</i>

240
00:19:17,358 --> 00:19:21,695
you've married Lady Arryn
and she's fallen through the Moon Door.

241
00:19:21,729 --> 00:19:23,797
She was always prone
to melancholy.

242
00:19:23,831 --> 00:19:27,334
My lady wasn't meant
for a world as brutal as ours.

243
00:19:27,368 --> 00:19:29,436
We were told there was a witness.
A girl.

244
00:19:29,470 --> 00:19:31,805
A niece of yours,
I believe.

245
00:19:33,441 --> 00:19:36,243
A girl with no learning
and scattered wits.

246
00:19:36,277 --> 00:19:37,577
I assure you,
she would be of no help.

247
00:19:37,612 --> 00:19:39,713
We'd like
to speak with her.

248
00:19:41,682 --> 00:19:44,117
- Let me fetch her.
<i>- No need.</i>

249
00:19:44,152 --> 00:19:48,421
We prefer to hear her
testimony unadulterated.

250
00:19:58,332 --> 00:20:00,000
<i>Come closer, child.</i>

251
00:20:00,034 --> 00:20:03,436
You have nothing
to fear from us or him.

252
00:20:03,471 --> 00:20:06,973
<i>Lord Baelish here</i>
<i>is your uncle?</i>

253
00:20:07,942 --> 00:20:09,376
<i>Your name is Alayne?</i>

254
00:20:11,145 --> 00:20:14,281
<i>Perhaps you would feel more comfortable</i>
<i>if Lord Baelish left the room.</i>

255
00:20:14,315 --> 00:20:16,082
- My lady--
- I wasn't asking you.

256
00:20:16,117 --> 00:20:17,027
He can stay.

257
00:20:17,052 --> 00:20:19,257
Speak up, girl, you're not
a damn kitchen mouse.

258
00:20:19,353 --> 00:20:21,421
Tell us what you saw.

259
00:20:24,425 --> 00:20:26,826
I'm sorry, Lord Baelish.

260
00:20:26,861 --> 00:20:28,728
I have to tell the truth.

261
00:20:33,701 --> 00:20:35,702
I'll tell you
everything.

262
00:20:35,736 --> 00:20:40,173
Please, Alayne,
leave nothing out.

263
00:20:41,876 --> 00:20:44,277
My name is not Alayne.

264
00:20:44,312 --> 00:20:46,780
It's Sansa Stark,

265
00:20:46,814 --> 00:20:49,449
eldest daughter
of Lord Eddard Stark.

266
00:20:49,483 --> 00:20:52,152
Lord Royce, we met when
you came to Winterfell.

267
00:20:52,186 --> 00:20:54,988
You were escorting your son
Ser Waymar to the Wall.

268
00:20:55,022 --> 00:20:58,225
Sansa Stark?

269
00:20:58,259 --> 00:21:01,461
You tell lies right to my face,
you little worm?

270
00:21:01,495 --> 00:21:04,698
Lord Baelish
has told many lies.

271
00:21:07,101 --> 00:21:09,469
All to protect me.

272
00:21:10,605 --> 00:21:12,772
<i>Since my father</i>
<i>was executed,</i>

273
00:21:12,807 --> 00:21:15,709
I have been a hostage
in King's Landing.

274
00:21:15,743 --> 00:21:18,545
A plaything for Joffrey
to torture

275
00:21:18,579 --> 00:21:20,747
or Queen Cersei
to torment.

276
00:21:20,781 --> 00:21:23,416
They beat me,
they humiliated me,

277
00:21:23,451 --> 00:21:26,319
they married me
to the Imp.

278
00:21:26,354 --> 00:21:29,222
I had no friends
in King's Landing...

279
00:21:31,492 --> 00:21:33,093
except one.

280
00:21:38,766 --> 00:21:41,368
He saved me.

281
00:21:41,402 --> 00:21:44,771
Smuggled me away
when he had the chance.

282
00:21:46,073 --> 00:21:48,742
He knew I'd be safe
here in the Eyrie

283
00:21:48,776 --> 00:21:51,411
with my own blood,
my Aunt Lysa.

284
00:21:53,114 --> 00:21:55,982
The Lannisters have
friends everywhere.

285
00:21:56,017 --> 00:21:57,284
<i>Even the Vale.</i>

286
00:21:57,318 --> 00:22:00,520
<i>He made me swear</i>
<i>not to tell anyone my true name.</i>

287
00:22:00,554 --> 00:22:03,356
Your secret is safe
with us, my lady.

288
00:22:03,391 --> 00:22:05,992
<i>Your father grew up</i>
<i>right here in these halls.</i>

289
00:22:06,027 --> 00:22:08,228
We hunted together
many times.

290
00:22:08,262 --> 00:22:09,729
He was a fine man.

291
00:22:09,797 --> 00:22:14,434
Tell us what happened
to your aunt, Sansa.

292
00:22:16,370 --> 00:22:19,439
You knew her well,
my lords, my lady.

293
00:22:19,473 --> 00:22:21,808
You knew she was
a troubled woman.

294
00:22:21,842 --> 00:22:24,644
She always loved
Lord Baelish.

295
00:22:24,679 --> 00:22:26,413
She told me herself.

296
00:22:26,447 --> 00:22:28,948
From the moment he arrived
at the gates of Riverrun,

297
00:22:28,983 --> 00:22:33,687
a boy of eight carrying
everything he owned in a little sack.

298
00:22:33,721 --> 00:22:38,191
<i>She confessed to me</i>
<i>she never loved Lord Arryn.</i>

299
00:22:38,225 --> 00:22:41,728
She did as her father commanded,
as so many of us have.

300
00:22:41,762 --> 00:22:45,765
<i>When the gods finally allowed</i>
<i>her to be with Lord Baelish,</i>

301
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:47,467
she was so happy.

302
00:22:47,501 --> 00:22:48,935
For a time.

303
00:22:50,104 --> 00:22:53,106
My aunt
was a jealous lady.

304
00:22:54,475 --> 00:22:57,877
She was terrified
that Lord Baelish

305
00:22:57,912 --> 00:22:59,179
didn't love her
anymore.

306
00:22:59,213 --> 00:23:01,781
That he would abandon
her for a younger woman.

307
00:23:05,186 --> 00:23:07,220
And then...

308
00:23:07,254 --> 00:23:10,590
one day she saw
him kiss me.

309
00:23:10,624 --> 00:23:12,292
Lady Sansa.

310
00:23:12,326 --> 00:23:15,428
It was a peck on the cheek,
Lord Royce, nothing more.

311
00:23:15,463 --> 00:23:19,065
Lord Baelish is my uncle now,
in truth, by marriage.

312
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:22,068
He's always been
so kind to me.

313
00:23:22,103 --> 00:23:24,971
I was so happy to be here,
to be free.

314
00:23:25,005 --> 00:23:27,140
All because of him.

315
00:23:27,174 --> 00:23:29,409
But my aunt
turned on me.

316
00:23:29,443 --> 00:23:32,812
She cursed me.
Called me a whore.

317
00:23:32,847 --> 00:23:35,548
Promised to throw me
through the Moon Door.

318
00:23:35,583 --> 00:23:38,017
When Lord Baelish tried
to calm her,

319
00:23:38,052 --> 00:23:39,886
she struck him.

320
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:41,621
She said she didn't want
to live anymore.

321
00:23:41,655 --> 00:23:43,757
<i>She stood on the edge</i>
<i>of that Moon Door.</i>

322
00:23:43,791 --> 00:23:45,558
He tried
to reason with her.

323
00:23:45,593 --> 00:23:48,094
Promised her she was the only one
he had ever loved,

324
00:23:48,129 --> 00:23:52,766
but she stepped through
those doors and she was--

325
00:23:55,136 --> 00:23:57,137
Shh.

326
00:23:57,171 --> 00:24:01,007
Shh, it's not your fault,
sweet girl.

327
00:24:05,279 --> 00:24:08,581
It's not
your fault.

328
00:24:23,764 --> 00:24:26,166
You could see it in the way she
raised that boy.

329
00:24:26,233 --> 00:24:29,135
Feeding him from her own teats
when he was 10 years old.

330
00:24:29,170 --> 00:24:32,238
Lord Royce!
This is hardly the time.

331
00:24:32,273 --> 00:24:34,007
Apologies, my lady.

332
00:24:34,041 --> 00:24:35,842
And to you
as well, Baelish.

333
00:24:35,876 --> 00:24:37,744
We treated you
/Ca bit harshly.

334
00:24:37,778 --> 00:24:39,579
You want justice,
Lord Royce.

335
00:24:39,613 --> 00:24:41,114
I can hardly
complain about that.

336
00:24:41,148 --> 00:24:42,949
I want the same.

337
00:24:42,983 --> 00:24:47,620
Not much justice to be meted
out in suicide, is there?

338
00:24:47,655 --> 00:24:49,956
For Lysa, no.
But for her son?

339
00:24:49,990 --> 00:24:52,125
Only 20 years ago,
the knights of the Vale

340
00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:55,428
rode behind Jon Arryn,
Ned Stark, Robert Baratheon.

341
00:24:55,463 --> 00:24:59,132
They fought together
to overcome the Mad King.

342
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:01,034
And since then,
Arryn and Royce,

343
00:25:01,068 --> 00:25:02,669
Corbray, Waynwood,

344
00:25:02,703 --> 00:25:05,905
all the great houses
of the Vale watched from the corner.

345
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:07,740
A timid boy
at a tavern brawl.

346
00:25:07,775 --> 00:25:10,276
Are you questioning
our courage?

347
00:25:10,311 --> 00:25:13,213
I want to know
which side you're on.

348
00:25:13,247 --> 00:25:14,747
Do you support
the Lannisters,

349
00:25:14,782 --> 00:25:16,883
the house that executed
your friend Ned Stark?

350
00:25:16,917 --> 00:25:19,185
Of course we don't
support the damn Lannisters.

351
00:25:19,220 --> 00:25:23,156
No? Catelyn Stark begged
her sister for support and Lysa refused.

352
00:25:23,190 --> 00:25:26,159
By staying out of the fray,
you've allowed Tywin Lannister

353
00:25:26,193 --> 00:25:28,728
to destroy his rivals
on every compass point.

354
00:25:28,762 --> 00:25:30,196
Who stands
against him now?

355
00:25:30,231 --> 00:25:32,899
Who would you have
us back, Lord Baelish?

356
00:25:32,933 --> 00:25:34,667
Robb Stark is dead.

357
00:25:34,702 --> 00:25:37,303
I'd have you back
Robin Arryn,

358
00:25:37,338 --> 00:25:39,005
Lord of the Vale.

359
00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:41,007
Robin Arryn is
a sickly little boy.

360
00:25:41,041 --> 00:25:44,477
And sickly little boys
sometimes become powerful men.

361
00:25:44,512 --> 00:25:46,579
More often
they die young.

362
00:25:46,614 --> 00:25:49,148
I adored Lysa
with all my heart.

363
00:25:49,183 --> 00:25:53,119
But she loved her son so much,
she became overprotective.

364
00:25:53,153 --> 00:25:55,889
He needs to learn
how to swing a sword.

365
00:25:55,923 --> 00:25:57,290
How to ride a horse.

366
00:25:57,324 --> 00:26:00,159
- Aye, it's time.
- Yes, it's time.

367
00:26:00,194 --> 00:26:02,061
Time for him
to tour the Vale,

368
00:26:02,096 --> 00:26:04,597
to visit all the castles
in his domain.

369
00:26:04,632 --> 00:26:08,001
Time for Robin
to leave the nest.

370
00:26:27,454 --> 00:26:29,722
<i>Ser Barristan.</i>

371
00:26:29,757 --> 00:26:31,591
Yes?

372
00:26:32,893 --> 00:26:34,661
Who sent you?

373
00:27:10,431 --> 00:27:12,565
- Ser Barristan.
- Ser Jorah.

374
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:15,401
Have I forgotten
a council meeting?

375
00:27:15,436 --> 00:27:17,704
No.

376
00:27:26,313 --> 00:27:28,247
What's this?

377
00:27:28,282 --> 00:27:29,782
A royal pardon

378
00:27:29,817 --> 00:27:32,418
signed by
Robert Baratheon.

379
00:27:45,933 --> 00:27:48,201
You spied on her.

380
00:27:50,437 --> 00:27:51,738
Who gave you this?

381
00:27:51,772 --> 00:27:54,173
Does it matter?

382
00:28:02,950 --> 00:28:04,384
Have you told her?

383
00:28:04,418 --> 00:28:06,719
I wanted to tell you first,
man-to-man

384
00:28:06,754 --> 00:28:09,722
rather than go
behind your back.

385
00:28:13,127 --> 00:28:14,994
Let me speak
with her in private.

386
00:28:15,029 --> 00:28:17,330
You'll never be alone
with her again.

387
00:28:53,767 --> 00:28:56,602
Why did the usurper
pardon you?

388
00:28:59,306 --> 00:29:01,274
If we could
speak alone.

389
00:29:01,308 --> 00:29:03,710
No, speak to me here.

390
00:29:03,744 --> 00:29:06,245
Explain it to me.

391
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:08,381
Who do you think
sent this to Meereen?

392
00:29:08,415 --> 00:29:10,216
Who profits?

393
00:29:10,250 --> 00:29:12,385
This is the work
of Tywin Lannister.

394
00:29:12,419 --> 00:29:14,220
He wants to divide us.

395
00:29:14,254 --> 00:29:16,923
If we're fighting each other,
we're not fighting him.

396
00:29:16,957 --> 00:29:19,926
The pardon was signed
the year we met.

397
00:29:21,729 --> 00:29:23,329
Why were you pardoned?

398
00:29:23,363 --> 00:29:25,732
Unless you're saying
this document was forged.

399
00:29:28,268 --> 00:29:30,136
It is not forged.

400
00:29:30,204 --> 00:29:32,171
Why, then?

401
00:29:32,206 --> 00:29:33,940
I sent letters to Varys,

402
00:29:33,974 --> 00:29:36,175
the spymaster
of King's Landing.

403
00:29:36,210 --> 00:29:38,644
What was the content
of these letters?

404
00:29:38,679 --> 00:29:41,080
- Information.
- What information?

405
00:29:41,115 --> 00:29:44,050
When you and Viserys
arrived in Pentos.

406
00:29:44,084 --> 00:29:46,552
His plan to marry you
to Khal Drogo.

407
00:29:46,587 --> 00:29:48,855
<i>When you were married.</i>

408
00:29:48,889 --> 00:29:50,623
When your brother died.

409
00:29:50,657 --> 00:29:53,126
You told him I was
carrying Drogo's child?

410
00:29:53,193 --> 00:29:54,761
- I--
- Yes or no?

411
00:29:54,795 --> 00:29:56,095
- Khaleesi.
- <i>Don't call me that.</i>

412
00:29:56,130 --> 00:29:59,432
Did you tell him I was
carrying Drogo's child?

413
00:30:01,735 --> 00:30:03,569
Yes.

414
00:30:06,273 --> 00:30:08,407
That wine merchant
tried to poison me

415
00:30:08,442 --> 00:30:10,009
because of
your information.

416
00:30:10,043 --> 00:30:11,844
I stopped you
from drinking his wine.

417
00:30:11,879 --> 00:30:13,813
Because you knew
it was poisoned.

418
00:30:13,847 --> 00:30:16,182
I suspected.

419
00:30:16,216 --> 00:30:18,618
You betrayed me

420
00:30:18,652 --> 00:30:20,820
from the first.

421
00:30:20,854 --> 00:30:23,689
Forgive me.

422
00:30:23,724 --> 00:30:25,925
I never meant--

423
00:30:25,959 --> 00:30:28,261
please, Khaleesi,
forgive me.

424
00:30:28,295 --> 00:30:30,997
You sold my secrets to
the man who killed my father

425
00:30:31,031 --> 00:30:32,999
- and stole my brother's throne...
- I have protected you.

426
00:30:33,033 --> 00:30:34,400
Fought for you.
Killed for you.

427
00:30:34,434 --> 00:30:36,002
...and you want me
to forgive you?

428
00:30:38,105 --> 00:30:39,939
I have loved you.

429
00:30:39,973 --> 00:30:41,908
Love?

430
00:30:41,942 --> 00:30:44,744
Love? How can you
say that to me?

431
00:30:44,778 --> 00:30:47,780
<i>Any other man, and I would</i>
<i>have you executed.</i>

432
00:30:47,815 --> 00:30:51,050
But you, I do not want you
in my city dead or alive.

433
00:30:51,084 --> 00:30:54,487
Go back to your masters
in King's Landing.

434
00:30:54,521 --> 00:30:57,056
Collect your pardon
if you can.

435
00:31:00,427 --> 00:31:01,794
Daenerys, please.

436
00:31:01,829 --> 00:31:05,364
Don't ever presume
to touch me again

437
00:31:05,399 --> 00:31:06,799
or speak my name.

438
00:31:06,834 --> 00:31:08,568
You have until dusk
to collect your things

439
00:31:08,602 --> 00:31:09,969
and leave this city.

440
00:31:10,003 --> 00:31:12,939
<i>If you're found in Meereen</i>
<i>past break of day,</i>

441
00:31:12,973 --> 00:31:15,608
I'll have your head
thrown into Slaver's Bay.

442
00:31:18,111 --> 00:31:19,779
Go.

443
00:31:21,481 --> 00:31:23,182
Now.

444
00:32:18,338 --> 00:32:21,240
Moat Cailin
is yours, Father.

445
00:32:27,915 --> 00:32:30,383
Walk with me.

446
00:32:30,417 --> 00:32:31,951
Has there been
any word from Locke?

447
00:32:31,985 --> 00:32:34,086
No.

448
00:32:34,121 --> 00:32:35,388
Unimportant.

449
00:32:35,422 --> 00:32:37,423
A cripple,
a young boy.

450
00:32:37,457 --> 00:32:40,493
None of the northern
lords have seen them.

451
00:32:40,527 --> 00:32:43,496
Dead most likely.

452
00:32:45,499 --> 00:32:48,234
Most of the ironborn
have fled the North.

453
00:32:48,268 --> 00:32:52,238
Now more will follow,
thanks to you.

454
00:32:54,641 --> 00:32:56,876
Tell me what you see.

455
00:32:59,379 --> 00:33:03,916
Moors, fields, hills.

456
00:33:03,951 --> 00:33:06,886
Tell me what you see.

457
00:33:11,158 --> 00:33:13,326
Nothing.

458
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:14,894
Not nothing.

459
00:33:14,928 --> 00:33:17,330
The North.

460
00:33:17,364 --> 00:33:20,132
Ride 700 miles that way,
you're still in the North.

461
00:33:20,167 --> 00:33:23,002
400 miles that way.

462
00:33:23,036 --> 00:33:25,071
300 miles that way.

463
00:33:25,105 --> 00:33:29,008
The North is larger
than the other six kingdoms combined.

464
00:33:29,042 --> 00:33:30,876
And I am the Warden
of the North.

465
00:33:30,911 --> 00:33:33,446
The North is mine.

466
00:33:35,215 --> 00:33:37,683
Now tell me,
what is your name?

467
00:33:41,254 --> 00:33:43,622
Ramsay Snow.

468
00:33:43,657 --> 00:33:45,791
No, not Ramsay Snow.

469
00:33:46,994 --> 00:33:48,761
Open it.

470
00:33:49,930 --> 00:33:51,931
From this day
until your last day,

471
00:33:51,965 --> 00:33:53,666
you are Ramsay Bolton,

472
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:56,602
son of Roose Bolton,
Warden of the North.

473
00:34:02,876 --> 00:34:05,011
You honor me.

474
00:34:05,045 --> 00:34:08,047
I swear I will
uphold your name

475
00:34:08,081 --> 00:34:10,049
and your tradition.

476
00:34:10,083 --> 00:34:12,451
I will be worthy
of you, Father,

477
00:34:12,486 --> 00:34:14,887
I promise.

478
00:34:33,173 --> 00:34:36,976
Come, Reek,
I'll be needing a bath.

479
00:35:05,772 --> 00:35:07,606
Yes?

480
00:35:20,821 --> 00:35:23,422
<i>First time I saw you,</i>
<i>you were just a child.</i>

481
00:35:23,457 --> 00:35:26,692
<i>A girl from the North</i>
<i>come to the capital for the first time.</i>

482
00:35:26,726 --> 00:35:29,428
Not a child any longer.

483
00:35:32,833 --> 00:35:34,934
Why did you help me?

484
00:35:34,968 --> 00:35:37,336
They would have thrown you
through the Moon Door

485
00:35:37,370 --> 00:35:39,038
if they found
you guilty.

486
00:35:39,072 --> 00:35:41,607
<i>That's not an answer.</i>

487
00:35:44,611 --> 00:35:46,345
If they'd have
executed you,

488
00:35:46,379 --> 00:35:47,847
what would they
have done with me?

489
00:35:48,849 --> 00:35:51,217
I don't know.

490
00:35:51,251 --> 00:35:53,719
Neither do I.

491
00:35:54,888 --> 00:35:56,889
Better to gamble
on the man you know

492
00:35:56,923 --> 00:35:58,657
than the strangers
you don't?

493
00:36:00,660 --> 00:36:02,695
And you think
you know me?

494
00:36:04,331 --> 00:36:06,098
I know what you want.

495
00:36:06,133 --> 00:36:08,000
<i>Do you?</i>

496
00:36:23,617 --> 00:36:25,151
I thought
it'd make me happy,

497
00:36:25,185 --> 00:36:27,153
but it doesn't.
Not really.

498
00:36:27,187 --> 00:36:29,221
Nothing makes
you happy.

499
00:36:29,256 --> 00:36:30,856
- Lots of things
make me happy.- Like what?

500
00:36:30,891 --> 00:36:32,925
Killing Polliver,
killing Rorge.

501
00:36:32,959 --> 00:36:36,162
So you're sad because
you didn't get to kill Joffrey yourself.

502
00:36:36,196 --> 00:36:37,463
Is that it?

503
00:36:37,497 --> 00:36:39,064
At least I could
have been there to watch.

504
00:36:39,099 --> 00:36:42,101
I wanted to see the look in his eyes
when he knew it was over.

505
00:36:42,135 --> 00:36:45,504
Aye, nothing in the world
beats that look.

506
00:36:45,539 --> 00:36:48,073
You protected him
for most of his life.

507
00:36:48,108 --> 00:36:49,475
You think you
could have saved him?

508
00:36:49,509 --> 00:36:52,545
I wasn't the damn
wine taster.

509
00:36:54,648 --> 00:36:58,851
Little shit deserved
to die, but poison--

510
00:36:58,885 --> 00:37:01,720
poison's a woman's weapon.

511
00:37:01,755 --> 00:37:03,622
Men kill with steel.

512
00:37:03,657 --> 00:37:05,124
That's your stupid
pride talking.

513
00:37:05,158 --> 00:37:07,493
It's why you'll never
be a great killer.

514
00:37:07,527 --> 00:37:10,329
I'd have killed Joffrey with
a chicken bone if I had to.

515
00:37:11,831 --> 00:37:14,867
I'd pay good money
to see that.

516
00:37:17,537 --> 00:37:20,639
You should have
let me burn it.

517
00:37:20,707 --> 00:37:23,175
It's a fleabite.

518
00:37:23,210 --> 00:37:26,645
That fleabite's got you walking
a lot slower than you used to.

519
00:37:26,713 --> 00:37:29,982
Well, we won't
have to walk too much further.

520
00:37:30,016 --> 00:37:31,951
You really think my aunt
will pay for me?

521
00:37:31,985 --> 00:37:33,552
Aye, she'll pay.

522
00:37:33,587 --> 00:37:34,954
I've never even
met her.

523
00:37:34,988 --> 00:37:38,390
Doesn't matter.
You're her blood.

524
00:37:39,593 --> 00:37:43,028
Family, honor,
all that horseshit.

525
00:37:43,063 --> 00:37:45,631
It's all you lords
and ladies ever talk about.

526
00:37:45,665 --> 00:37:47,833
I'm not a lady.

527
00:37:49,336 --> 00:37:51,103
Who would pass
the Bloody Gate?

528
00:37:51,137 --> 00:37:54,473
The bloody Hound,
Sandor Clegane.

529
00:37:54,507 --> 00:37:56,775
And his...

530
00:37:56,810 --> 00:37:59,812
traveling companion
Arya Stark,

531
00:37:59,846 --> 00:38:02,815
<i>niece of your lady</i>
<i>Lysa Arryn.</i>

532
00:38:02,849 --> 00:38:05,718
Then I offer
my condolences.

533
00:38:05,752 --> 00:38:08,053
Lady Arryn died.

534
00:38:11,391 --> 00:38:13,325
Three days ago.

535
00:38:31,344 --> 00:38:33,479
I've never left home
before, Uncle Petyr.

536
00:38:33,513 --> 00:38:35,648
- I'm afraid to leave.
- You shouldn't be.

537
00:38:35,682 --> 00:38:38,751
The Lord of the Vale
belongs in the Eyrie, Mother said.

538
00:38:38,785 --> 00:38:41,287
She said it's not
safe outside.

539
00:38:41,321 --> 00:38:43,055
It wasn't safe
for her inside.

540
00:38:43,089 --> 00:38:46,859
People die
at their dinner tables.

541
00:38:46,893 --> 00:38:48,994
They die in their beds.

542
00:38:49,029 --> 00:38:52,431
They die squatting
over their chamber pots.

543
00:38:52,465 --> 00:38:54,867
Everybody dies
sooner or later.

544
00:38:54,901 --> 00:38:56,735
Don't worry
about your death.

545
00:38:56,770 --> 00:38:59,471
Worry about your life.

546
00:38:59,506 --> 00:39:01,874
Take charge of your life

547
00:39:01,908 --> 00:39:04,343
for as long as it lasts.

548
00:39:04,377 --> 00:39:07,313
That is what it means
to be Lord of the Vale.

549
00:39:31,338 --> 00:39:33,339
Shall we go?

550
00:39:40,714 --> 00:39:43,015
Wine always helps.

551
00:39:44,651 --> 00:39:47,119
I thank you
for it.

552
00:39:48,621 --> 00:39:50,489
Trial by combat.

553
00:39:51,891 --> 00:39:54,960
Deciding a man's guilt
or innocence

554
00:39:54,994 --> 00:39:57,196
in the eyes of the gods

555
00:39:57,230 --> 00:39:59,832
by having two other men
hack each other to pieces.

556
00:39:59,866 --> 00:40:02,634
Tells you something
about the gods.

557
00:40:05,004 --> 00:40:06,705
How much longer?

558
00:40:06,740 --> 00:40:09,041
Soon.

559
00:40:12,078 --> 00:40:14,213
Do you think
Oberyn has a chance?

560
00:40:17,050 --> 00:40:19,184
The Red Viper of Dorne.

561
00:40:19,219 --> 00:40:21,420
You don't get a name
like that unless you're deadly, right?

562
00:40:21,454 --> 00:40:22,855
<i>I've never</i>
<i>seen him fight.</i>

563
00:40:22,922 --> 00:40:25,624
Oh, he's going to die.
I'm going to die.

564
00:40:25,658 --> 00:40:26,959
Oberyn believes in himself.

565
00:40:26,993 --> 00:40:29,061
That's putting it mildly.

566
00:40:30,296 --> 00:40:32,264
What's the punishment
for regicide?

567
00:40:32,298 --> 00:40:35,100
Drawing and quartering?
Hanging?

568
00:40:35,135 --> 00:40:37,469
- <i>Breaking at the wheel?</i>
- Beheading.

569
00:40:37,504 --> 00:40:39,238
<i>Seems rather</i>
<i>ordinary.</i>

570
00:40:39,272 --> 00:40:41,774
<i>And he was my nephew</i>
<i>as well, so what is that?</i>

571
00:40:41,808 --> 00:40:43,342
Fratricide is brothers.

572
00:40:43,376 --> 00:40:45,544
Filicide is sons.

573
00:40:46,579 --> 00:40:49,114
Nepoticide.
That's the one.

574
00:40:51,751 --> 00:40:54,253
Matricide, patricide,

575
00:40:54,287 --> 00:40:57,156
infanticide, suicide.

576
00:40:58,691 --> 00:41:01,126
There's no kind of killing that
doesn't have its own word.

577
00:41:01,161 --> 00:41:03,028
Cousins.

578
00:41:03,062 --> 00:41:05,130
<i>Cousins, you're right.</i>

579
00:41:05,165 --> 00:41:06,899
There is no word
for cousin killing.

580
00:41:06,933 --> 00:41:08,734
Well done.

581
00:41:08,768 --> 00:41:11,804
Do you remember cousin Orson?
Orson Lannister?

582
00:41:11,838 --> 00:41:12,473
Of course.

583
00:41:12,498 --> 00:41:14,173
Wet-nurse dropped
him on his head.

584
00:41:14,174 --> 00:41:16,775
- Left him simple.
- <i>Simple?</i>

585
00:41:16,810 --> 00:41:18,844
Used to sit all day
in the garden.

586
00:41:18,878 --> 00:41:20,646
Crushing beetles
with a rock.

587
00:41:24,384 --> 00:41:26,585
Nothing made him happier.

588
00:41:26,619 --> 00:41:27,953
Nothing made you happier.

589
00:41:27,987 --> 00:41:29,855
You'd think being
tormented from birth

590
00:41:29,889 --> 00:41:32,057
would have given you some
affinity for the afflicted.

591
00:41:32,091 --> 00:41:33,027
On the contrary.

592
00:41:33,052 --> 00:41:35,259
Laughing at another
person's misery

593
00:41:35,328 --> 00:41:37,296
was the only thing that made me
feel like everyone else.

594
00:41:37,330 --> 00:41:39,198
The joke wore thin, though.

595
00:41:39,232 --> 00:41:41,133
<i>For you.</i>
<i>You drifted away.</i>

596
00:41:41,167 --> 00:41:42,835
I had other interests.

597
00:41:42,869 --> 00:41:44,870
Yes, other interests.

598
00:41:47,073 --> 00:41:48,774
But I stayed with Orson.

599
00:41:48,808 --> 00:41:50,742
<i>Why?</i>

600
00:41:50,777 --> 00:41:52,211
I was curious.

601
00:41:52,245 --> 00:41:54,613
Why was he smashing
all those beetles?

602
00:41:54,647 --> 00:41:56,181
What did he
get out of it?

603
00:41:56,216 --> 00:41:58,317
<i>First thing I did</i>
<i>was ask him.</i>

604
00:41:58,351 --> 00:42:02,087
"Orson, why are you smashing
all those beetles?"

605
00:42:02,121 --> 00:42:05,157
He gave me an answer.
"Smash the beetles.

606
00:42:05,191 --> 00:42:08,126
Smash 'em."

607
00:42:09,229 --> 00:42:10,896
<i>I wasn't deterred.</i>

608
00:42:10,930 --> 00:42:12,631
I was the smartest
person I knew.

609
00:42:12,665 --> 00:42:15,200
Certainly I had the wherewithal to
unravel the mysteries

610
00:42:15,235 --> 00:42:16,902
that lay at the heart
of a moron.

611
00:42:16,936 --> 00:42:20,506
So I went to
Maester Volarik's library.

612
00:42:20,540 --> 00:42:22,708
Volarik.
Tried to touch me once.

613
00:42:22,742 --> 00:42:25,244
Turns out, far too much has been
written about great men

614
00:42:25,278 --> 00:42:27,446
and not nearly enough
about morons.

615
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:29,781
Doesn't seem right.

616
00:42:29,816 --> 00:42:31,750
In any case,
I found nothing

617
00:42:31,784 --> 00:42:33,785
that illuminated the nature
of Orson's affliction

618
00:42:33,820 --> 00:42:36,622
or the reason behind his
relentless beetle slaughter.

619
00:42:36,656 --> 00:42:38,991
<i>So I went back</i>
<i>to the source.</i>

620
00:42:39,025 --> 00:42:41,193
<i>I may not have been able</i>
<i>to speak with Orson,</i>

621
00:42:41,227 --> 00:42:43,862
but I could observe him,
watch him

622
00:42:43,897 --> 00:42:46,131
the way men
watch animals

623
00:42:46,165 --> 00:42:49,034
to come to a deeper understanding
of their behavior.

624
00:42:51,871 --> 00:42:53,238
And as I watched,

625
00:42:53,273 --> 00:42:55,774
I became more and more
sure of it.

626
00:42:55,808 --> 00:42:58,443
There was something
happening there.

627
00:42:58,478 --> 00:43:01,713
His face was like
the page of a book

628
00:43:01,748 --> 00:43:03,682
written in a language
I didn't understand.

629
00:43:03,716 --> 00:43:06,552
But he wasn't mindless.
He had his reasons.

630
00:43:06,586 --> 00:43:09,855
<i>And I became possessed</i>
<i>with knowing what they were.</i>

631
00:43:09,889 --> 00:43:13,425
I began to spend inordinate
amounts of time watching him.

632
00:43:13,459 --> 00:43:16,094
I would eat my lunch
in the garden,

633
00:43:16,129 --> 00:43:18,230
chewing my mutton
to the music of...

634
00:43:19,966 --> 00:43:22,834
And when I wasn't watching him,
I was thinking about him.

635
00:43:22,869 --> 00:43:25,637
Father droned on about
the family legacy

636
00:43:25,672 --> 00:43:27,406
<i>and I thought about</i>
<i>Orson's beetles.</i>

637
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:30,309
I read the histories
of Targaryen conquests.

638
00:43:30,343 --> 00:43:32,544
Did I hear dragon wings?
No.

639
00:43:32,579 --> 00:43:35,547
I heard...

640
00:43:35,582 --> 00:43:39,318
<i>And I still couldn't figure</i>
<i>out why he was doing it.</i>

641
00:43:39,352 --> 00:43:41,653
And I had to know,
because it was horrible

642
00:43:41,688 --> 00:43:45,057
that all these beetles
should be dying for no reason.

643
00:43:45,091 --> 00:43:46,625
Every day around the world,

644
00:43:46,659 --> 00:43:50,062
men, women, and children
are murdered by the score.

645
00:43:50,096 --> 00:43:52,898
Who gives a dusty fuck
about a bunch of beetles?

646
00:43:52,932 --> 00:43:55,734
I know, I know.
But still, it filled me with dread.

647
00:43:55,768 --> 00:43:59,304
Piles and piles of them,
years and years of them.

648
00:43:59,339 --> 00:44:01,173
How many countless living
crawling things

649
00:44:01,207 --> 00:44:04,176
smashed and dried out
and returned to the dirt?

650
00:44:04,210 --> 00:44:06,612
In my dreams I found myself

651
00:44:06,646 --> 00:44:09,114
standing on a beach
made of beetle husks

652
00:44:09,148 --> 00:44:11,183
stretching as far
as the eye could see.

653
00:44:11,217 --> 00:44:13,385
I woke up crying,

654
00:44:13,419 --> 00:44:15,787
weeping for their
shattered little bodies.

655
00:44:15,822 --> 00:44:18,156
I tried to stop
Orson once.

656
00:44:18,191 --> 00:44:19,591
He was twice your size.

657
00:44:19,626 --> 00:44:21,360
He just pushed me
aside with a "kuuh"

658
00:44:21,394 --> 00:44:23,962
and kept on smashing.

659
00:44:23,997 --> 00:44:26,498
Every day until
that mule

660
00:44:26,532 --> 00:44:28,533
kicked him in the chest
and killed him.

661
00:44:39,345 --> 00:44:41,780
So what do you think?

662
00:44:41,814 --> 00:44:44,249
Why did he do it?

663
00:44:44,283 --> 00:44:46,618
What was it all about?

664
00:44:50,289 --> 00:44:52,391
I don't know.

665
00:45:10,943 --> 00:45:12,844
Good luck today.

666
00:45:45,378 --> 00:45:47,345
Looks like
very light armor.

667
00:45:47,380 --> 00:45:48,747
I like to move around.

668
00:45:48,781 --> 00:45:50,682
You could at least
wear a helmet.

669
00:45:52,785 --> 00:45:54,486
You shouldn't drink
before a fight.

670
00:45:54,520 --> 00:45:56,722
You learn this during your years
in the fighting pits?

671
00:45:56,756 --> 00:45:59,057
I always drink
before a fight.

672
00:45:59,092 --> 00:46:01,526
It could get you killed.
It could get me killed.

673
00:46:01,561 --> 00:46:04,529
Today is not
the day I die.

674
00:46:11,938 --> 00:46:13,538
You're going
to fight that?

675
00:46:13,573 --> 00:46:16,108
I'm going
to kill that.

676
00:46:20,446 --> 00:46:22,147
He is the biggest man
I've ever seen.

677
00:46:22,181 --> 00:46:24,916
Size does not matter
when you are flat on your back.

678
00:46:24,984 --> 00:46:26,251
Thank the gods.

679
00:46:28,788 --> 00:46:31,923
In the sight of gods
and men,

680
00:46:31,958 --> 00:46:34,159
we gather to ascertain

681
00:46:34,193 --> 00:46:36,962
the guilt or innocence
of this...

682
00:46:38,598 --> 00:46:41,133
<i>man Tyrion Lannister.</i>

683
00:46:41,167 --> 00:46:43,335
<i>May the Mother grant</i>
<i>them mercy.</i>

684
00:46:43,369 --> 00:46:47,539
May the Father give them
such justice as they deserve.

685
00:46:47,573 --> 00:46:50,275
And may the Warrior
guide the hand...

686
00:46:50,309 --> 00:46:53,445
...of our champion--

687
00:47:01,320 --> 00:47:03,588
Don't leave me
alone in this world.

688
00:47:03,623 --> 00:47:05,524
Never.

689
00:47:25,945 --> 00:47:27,646
Have they told you
who I am?

690
00:47:27,680 --> 00:47:29,347
Some dead man.

691
00:47:34,320 --> 00:47:37,055
I am the brother
of Elia Martell.

692
00:47:37,089 --> 00:47:40,158
Do you know why I have come
all the way to this stinking

693
00:47:40,193 --> 00:47:42,427
shit-pile of a city?

694
00:47:42,461 --> 00:47:44,296
For you.

695
00:47:48,801 --> 00:47:51,770
I'm going to hear you
confess before you die.

696
00:47:51,804 --> 00:47:53,805
You raped my sister.

697
00:47:53,840 --> 00:47:55,240
You murdered her.

698
00:47:55,274 --> 00:47:57,042
You killed her children.

699
00:47:57,076 --> 00:47:59,811
Say it now and we can
make this quick.

700
00:48:07,887 --> 00:48:10,956
Say it.
You raped her.

701
00:48:12,158 --> 00:48:14,759
