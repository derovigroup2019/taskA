3
00:02:13,606 --> 00:02:15,473
Welcome, Lord Stark.

4
00:02:15,508 --> 00:02:18,342
Grand Maester Pycelle has called
a meeting of the Small Council.

5
00:02:18,377 --> 00:02:20,477
The honor of your presence
is requested.

6
00:02:21,979 --> 00:02:25,082
Get the girls settled in.
I'll be back in time for supper.

7
00:02:25,116 --> 00:02:27,751
- And, Jory, you go with them.
- Yes, my Lord.

8
00:02:27,786 --> 00:02:31,522
If you'd like to change into
something more appropriate...

9
00:03:07,693 --> 00:03:10,028
Thank the gods
you're here, Stark.

10
00:03:11,184 --> 00:03:14,206
About time we had some
stern, northern leadership.

11
00:03:15,434 --> 00:03:17,135
About glad to see you're
protecting the throne.

12
00:03:17,169 --> 00:03:19,203
Sturdy old thing.

13
00:03:19,238 --> 00:03:21,706
How many Kings' asses
have polished it, I wonder?

14
00:03:21,741 --> 00:03:23,741
Um, what's the line?

15
00:03:23,776 --> 00:03:26,879
The King shits
and The Hand wipes.

16
00:03:26,913 --> 00:03:30,383
Very handsome armor.

17
00:03:30,417 --> 00:03:32,819
- Not a scratch on it.
- I know.

18
00:03:32,853 --> 00:03:36,390
People have been swinging at me for years,
but they always seem to miss.

19
00:03:36,424 --> 00:03:39,293
You've chosen your opponents
wisely then.

20
00:03:40,529 --> 00:03:42,564
I have a knack for it.

21
00:03:45,701 --> 00:03:48,836
It must be strange for you
coming into this room.

22
00:03:51,106 --> 00:03:54,075
I was standing right here
when it happened.

23
00:03:55,077 --> 00:03:57,144
He was very brave,
your brother.

24
00:03:57,179 --> 00:03:58,980
Your father too.

25
00:03:59,014 --> 00:04:01,148
They didn't deserve
to die like that.

26
00:04:01,183 --> 00:04:04,051
Nobody deserves
to die like that.

27
00:04:04,086 --> 00:04:05,953
But you just stood there
and watched.

28
00:04:05,988 --> 00:04:08,957
500 men just stood there
and watched.

29
00:04:08,991 --> 00:04:11,760
All the great knights
of the Seven Kingdoms--

30
00:04:11,794 --> 00:04:14,195
you think anyone said a word,
lifted a finger?

31
00:04:14,230 --> 00:04:16,831
No, Lord Stark.

32
00:04:16,866 --> 00:04:21,469
500 men and this room
was silent as a crypt.

33
00:04:23,138 --> 00:04:25,607
Except for the screams,
of course,

34
00:04:25,641 --> 00:04:28,476
and the Mad King
laughing.

35
00:04:28,511 --> 00:04:31,246
And later...

36
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:33,914
when I watched
the Mad King die,

37
00:04:33,948 --> 00:04:37,317
I remembered him laughing
as your father burned...

38
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:40,287
It felt like justice.

39
00:04:43,291 --> 00:04:45,959
Is that what you
tell yourself at night?

40
00:04:47,028 --> 00:04:49,764
You're a servant
of justice?

41
00:04:49,798 --> 00:04:51,866
That you were avenging
my father when you

42
00:04:51,901 --> 00:04:54,470
shoved your sword in
Aerys Targaryen's back?

43
00:04:54,504 --> 00:04:56,272
Tell me--

44
00:04:56,307 --> 00:04:59,342
if I'd stabbed the Mad King
in the belly instead of the back,

45
00:04:59,377 --> 00:05:01,946
would you admire me more?

46
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:04,515
You served him well

47
00:05:04,549 --> 00:05:07,485
when serving was safe.

48
00:05:19,332 --> 00:05:21,567
Lord Stark.

49
00:05:24,003 --> 00:05:25,804
Lord Varys.

50
00:05:25,839 --> 00:05:29,207
I was grievously sorry to hear of
your troubles on the Kingsroad.

51
00:05:29,242 --> 00:05:32,877
We are all praying for
Prince Joffrey's full recovery.

52
00:05:32,912 --> 00:05:36,347
A shame you didn't say
a prayer for the butcher's son.

53
00:05:37,482 --> 00:05:40,784
Renly!
You're looking well.

54
00:05:40,818 --> 00:05:42,586
And you look
tired from the road.

55
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:44,788
I told them this meeting could
wait another day, but--

56
00:05:44,822 --> 00:05:47,591
<i>But we have a Kingdom</i>
<i>to look after.</i>

57
00:05:47,625 --> 00:05:50,894
I've hoped to meet you
for some time, Lord Stark.

58
00:05:50,928 --> 00:05:52,682
No doubt Lady Catelyn
has mentioned me.

59
00:05:52,707 --> 00:05:54,333
She has, Lord Baelish.

60
00:05:54,565 --> 00:05:57,634
I understand you knew
my brother Brandon as well.

61
00:05:57,668 --> 00:06:00,904
All too well.
I still carry a token of his esteem

62
00:06:00,938 --> 00:06:02,907
from navel to collarbone.

63
00:06:02,941 --> 00:06:05,009
Perhaps you chose
the wrong man to duel with.

64
00:06:05,043 --> 00:06:07,011
It wasn't the <i>man</i>
that I chose, my Lord.

65
00:06:07,045 --> 00:06:09,414
It was Catelyn Tully.

66
00:06:09,449 --> 00:06:12,785
A woman worth fighting for,
I'm sure you'll agree.

67
00:06:12,819 --> 00:06:15,488
I humbly beg your pardon,
my Lord Stark.

68
00:06:15,522 --> 00:06:18,158
Grand Maester.

69
00:06:18,192 --> 00:06:20,394
How many years has it been?

70
00:06:20,429 --> 00:06:24,098
- <i>You were a young man.</i>
- And you served another King.

71
00:06:25,901 --> 00:06:28,669
Oh, how forgetful of me.

72
00:06:30,239 --> 00:06:32,539
This belongs to you, now.

73
00:06:35,177 --> 00:06:36,911
<i>Should we begin?</i>

74
00:06:38,113 --> 00:06:39,981
- Without the King?
- Winter may be coming,

75
00:06:40,015 --> 00:06:43,318
but I'm afraid the same cannot
be said for my brother.

76
00:06:43,352 --> 00:06:45,419
His Grace has many cares.

77
00:06:45,454 --> 00:06:48,455
He entrusts some
small matters to us

78
00:06:48,489 --> 00:06:50,290
that we might
lighten the load.

79
00:06:50,325 --> 00:06:53,226
We are the Lords
of Small Matters here.

80
00:06:58,198 --> 00:07:00,666
<i>My brother instructs us</i>
<i>to stage a tournament</i>

81
00:07:00,701 --> 00:07:03,536
in honor of Lord Stark's appointment
as Hand of the King.

82
00:07:03,570 --> 00:07:04,840
Mmm, how much?

83
00:07:04,865 --> 00:07:07,041
40,000 gold dragons
to the champion,

84
00:07:07,274 --> 00:07:08,975
<i>20,000 to the runner-up,</i>

85
00:07:09,010 --> 00:07:12,145
20,000 to
the winning archer.

86
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:14,482
Can the treasury bear
such expense?

87
00:07:14,812 --> 00:07:15,705
I'll have to borrow it.

88
00:07:15,730 --> 00:07:16,930
The Lannisters will
accommodate, I expect.

89
00:07:17,486 --> 00:07:19,545
We already owe Lord Tywin
three million gold.

90
00:07:19,570 --> 00:07:20,655
What's another 80,000?

91
00:07:20,727 --> 00:07:22,561
Are you telling me the crown
is three million in debt?

92
00:07:22,625 --> 00:07:24,692
I'm telling you the crown
is <i>six</i> million in debt.

93
00:07:24,726 --> 00:07:26,627
How could you
let this happen?

94
00:07:26,661 --> 00:07:28,428
The Master of Coin
finds the money.

95
00:07:28,463 --> 00:07:30,897
The King
and The Hand spend it.

96
00:07:30,932 --> 00:07:32,666
I will not believe
Jon Arryn

97
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:34,501
allowed Robert
to bankrupt the realm.

98
00:07:34,535 --> 00:07:37,504
Lord Arryn gave wise
and prudent advice,

99
00:07:37,538 --> 00:07:39,806
but I fear his Grace

100
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:43,743
- doesn't always listen.
- "Counting coppers," he calls it.

101
00:07:43,777 --> 00:07:46,145
I'll speak to him
tomorrow.

102
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:49,048
This tournament is an
extravagance we cannot afford.

103
00:07:49,082 --> 00:07:51,450
As you will. But still,
we'd best make our plans.

104
00:07:51,484 --> 00:07:53,618
There will be no plans

105
00:07:53,652 --> 00:07:55,987
until I speak to Robert.

106
00:07:59,524 --> 00:08:01,525
Forgive me, my Lords.
I'm--

107
00:08:01,559 --> 00:08:05,229
- <i>I had a long ride.</i>
- You are The King's Hand,

108
00:08:05,264 --> 00:08:08,833
Lord Stark, we serve
at your pleasure.

109
00:08:15,476 --> 00:08:17,944
- Ow!
- Please, it's nearly healed.

110
00:08:20,381 --> 00:08:23,784
- It's ugly.
- A King should have scars

111
00:08:23,818 --> 00:08:27,621
you fought off a direwolf.
You're a warrior like your father.

112
00:08:27,655 --> 00:08:29,957
I'm not like him.
I didn't fight off anything.

113
00:08:29,991 --> 00:08:31,993
It bit me and all
I did was scream.

114
00:08:32,027 --> 00:08:34,295
And the two Stark girls
saw it, both of them.

115
00:08:34,329 --> 00:08:37,399
That's not true.
You killed the beast.

116
00:08:37,433 --> 00:08:40,635
You only spared the girl because
of the love your father bears her father.

117
00:08:40,669 --> 00:08:41,480
I didn't, I--

118
00:08:41,505 --> 00:08:43,510
When Aerys Targaryen
sat on the Iron Throne,

119
00:08:43,806 --> 00:08:46,274
your father was a rebel
and a traitor.

120
00:08:46,308 --> 00:08:50,678
Someday you'll sit on the throne
and the truth will be what you make it.

121
00:08:54,281 --> 00:08:56,148
Do I have
to marry her?

122
00:08:56,183 --> 00:08:57,983
Yes.

123
00:08:59,285 --> 00:09:01,386
She's very beautiful
and young.

124
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:04,656
If you don't like her, you only
need to see her on formal occasions

125
00:09:04,691 --> 00:09:08,593
and when the time comes,
to make little princes and princesses.

126
00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:13,766
And if you'd rather fuck painted whores,
you'll fuck painted whores.

127
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:16,902
And if you'd rather lie
with noble virgins, so be it.

128
00:09:16,936 --> 00:09:18,970
You are my darling boy
and the world will be

129
00:09:19,005 --> 00:09:21,239
exactly as you
want it to be.

130
00:09:24,411 --> 00:09:26,712
Do something nice
for the Stark girl.

131
00:09:26,746 --> 00:09:29,015
- I don't want to.
- No, but you will.

132
00:09:29,049 --> 00:09:33,119
The occasional kindness will spare
you all sorts of trouble down the road.

133
00:09:34,255 --> 00:09:36,189
We allow the Northerners
too much power.

134
00:09:36,224 --> 00:09:38,592
They consider themselves
our equals.

135
00:09:38,626 --> 00:09:40,761
How would you handle them?

136
00:09:40,795 --> 00:09:42,963
I'd double their taxes

137
00:09:42,997 --> 00:09:46,499
and command them to supply
10,000 men to the Royal Army.

138
00:09:46,533 --> 00:09:48,015
A Royal Army?

139
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:49,816
Why should every lord
command his own men?

140
00:09:49,836 --> 00:09:52,170
It's primitive,
no better than the hill tribes.

141
00:09:52,205 --> 00:09:55,140
We should have a standing army
of men loyal to the crown,

142
00:09:55,174 --> 00:09:57,008
trained by
experienced soldiers--

143
00:09:57,043 --> 00:10:00,645
instead of a mob of peasants
who've never held pikes in their lives.

144
00:10:00,679 --> 00:10:03,247
And if
the Northerners rebel?

145
00:10:03,281 --> 00:10:04,916
I'd crush them.

146
00:10:04,950 --> 00:10:07,652
Seize Winterfell and install
someone loyal to the realm

147
00:10:07,686 --> 00:10:10,621
as warden of the North.
Uncle Kevan, maybe.

148
00:10:10,656 --> 00:10:14,325
And these 10,000 Northern troops,
would they fight for you or their lord?

149
00:10:14,359 --> 00:10:16,794
- For me. I'm their King.
- <i>Mm-hmm.</i>

150
00:10:16,828 --> 00:10:18,929
But you've just
invaded their homeland,

151
00:10:18,963 --> 00:10:21,731
- asked them to kill their brothers.
- I'm not asking.

152
00:10:21,766 --> 00:10:24,768
The North cannot be held--
not by an outsider.

153
00:10:24,802 --> 00:10:27,437
It's too big and too wild.
And when the winter comes,

154
00:10:27,471 --> 00:10:30,807
the Seven Gods together couldn't
save you and your royal army.

155
00:10:30,841 --> 00:10:33,809
A good King knows
when to save his strength...

156
00:10:35,312 --> 00:10:37,646
And when to destroy
his enemies.

157
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:40,415
So you agree...

158
00:10:40,449 --> 00:10:42,851
The Starks are enemies?

159
00:10:44,854 --> 00:10:47,589
Everyone who isn't us

160
00:10:47,624 --> 00:10:49,625
is an enemy.

161
00:10:51,895 --> 00:10:54,497
Enough of that, young lady.
Eat your food.

162
00:10:54,532 --> 00:10:56,433
- I'm practicing.
- Practicing for what?

163
00:10:56,468 --> 00:10:58,535
- The Prince.
- <i>Arya, stop!</i>

164
00:10:58,570 --> 00:11:01,739
He's a liar and a coward
and he killed my friend.

165
00:11:01,773 --> 00:11:03,277
The Hound killed your friend.

166
00:11:03,302 --> 00:11:05,632
The Hound does whatever
the Prince tells him to do.

167
00:11:05,744 --> 00:11:06,625
You're an idiot.

168
00:11:06,650 --> 00:11:08,285
You're a liar, and if
you told the truth

169
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:11,082
- Mycah would be alive.
- Enough!

170
00:11:12,684 --> 00:11:14,385
What's happening here?

171
00:11:14,419 --> 00:11:17,721
Arya would rather act
like a beast than a lady.

172
00:11:19,390 --> 00:11:21,725
Go to your room.
We'll speak later.

173
00:11:29,569 --> 00:11:32,537
That's for you, love.

174
00:11:40,848 --> 00:11:43,783
<i>The same dollmaker makes all</i>
<i>of Princess Myrcella's toys.</i>

175
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:48,622
Don't you like it?

176
00:11:48,656 --> 00:11:51,559
I haven't played with dolls
since I was eight.

177
00:11:52,995 --> 00:11:55,730
- May I be excused?
- You've barely eaten a thing.

178
00:11:56,933 --> 00:11:59,435
It's all right.
Go on.

179
00:12:08,644 --> 00:12:11,078
War was easier
than daughters.

180
00:12:15,182 --> 00:12:17,783
Go away!

181
00:12:17,818 --> 00:12:20,385
<i>Arya, open the door.</i>

182
00:12:30,329 --> 00:12:32,630
May I come in?

183
00:12:39,037 --> 00:12:41,772
- Whose sword is that?
- Mine.

184
00:12:41,807 --> 00:12:43,641
Give it to me.

185
00:12:50,316 --> 00:12:53,252
I know this maker's mark.
This is Mikken's work.

186
00:12:55,356 --> 00:12:57,190
Where did you get this?

187
00:13:01,096 --> 00:13:03,330
This is no toy.

188
00:13:05,199 --> 00:13:06,630
Little ladies shouldn't
play with swords.

189
00:13:06,655 --> 00:13:07,855
I wasn't playing.

190
00:13:08,168 --> 00:13:10,102
And I don't want
to be a lady.

191
00:13:10,136 --> 00:13:12,537
Come here.

192
00:13:17,777 --> 00:13:20,111
Now what do you want
with this?

193
00:13:20,145 --> 00:13:22,046
It's called Needle.

194
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:24,716
Oh, a blade with a name.

195
00:13:25,951 --> 00:13:28,653
And who were you hoping
to skewer with Needle?

196
00:13:28,687 --> 00:13:30,422
Your sister?

197
00:13:30,456 --> 00:13:32,824
Do you know the first thing
about sword fighting?

198
00:13:32,858 --> 00:13:34,626
Stick 'em
with the pointy end.

199
00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:37,662
That's the essence of it.

200
00:13:40,299 --> 00:13:42,534
I was trying
to learn.

201
00:13:44,270 --> 00:13:47,139
I asked Mycah
to practice with me.

202
00:13:48,809 --> 00:13:50,611
I asked him.

203
00:13:51,813 --> 00:13:54,515
- It was my fault.
- No, sweet girl.

204
00:13:54,549 --> 00:13:58,052
No no, you didn't kill
the butcher's boy.

205
00:13:59,254 --> 00:14:02,490
I hate them!
I hate all of them.

206
00:14:02,524 --> 00:14:05,126
The Hound, the Queen
and the King

207
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:06,608
and Joffrey and Sansa.

208
00:14:06,609 --> 00:14:09,043
Sansa was dragged before
the King and Queen...

209
00:14:10,433 --> 00:14:13,067
And asked to call
the Prince a liar.

210
00:14:13,102 --> 00:14:15,603
So was I!
He <i>is</i> a liar.

211
00:14:15,638 --> 00:14:17,739
Shh, darling,
listen to me.

212
00:14:19,208 --> 00:14:22,244
Sansa will be married
to Joffrey's someday.

213
00:14:22,278 --> 00:14:24,580
She cannot betray him.

214
00:14:24,614 --> 00:14:27,450
She must take his side
even when he's wrong.

215
00:14:28,719 --> 00:14:31,388
But how you can let her
marry someone like that?

216
00:14:33,291 --> 00:14:35,192
Well.

217
00:14:36,795 --> 00:14:39,297
Look me.

218
00:14:39,331 --> 00:14:42,600
You're a Stark of Winterfell.
You know our words.

219
00:14:44,736 --> 00:14:46,170
Winter is coming.

220
00:14:47,471 --> 00:14:49,873
You were born
in the long summer.

221
00:14:49,907 --> 00:14:52,008
You've never known
anything else.

222
00:14:52,042 --> 00:14:54,076
But now winter
is truly coming.

223
00:14:54,111 --> 00:14:57,012
And in the winter,
we must protect ourselves,

224
00:14:57,046 --> 00:15:01,483
look after one another.
Sansa is your sister.

225
00:15:02,718 --> 00:15:05,087
I don't hate her.

226
00:15:05,121 --> 00:15:07,289
Not really.

227
00:15:08,557 --> 00:15:10,525
I don't want
to frighten you,

228
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:12,394
but I won't lie
to you either.

229
00:15:12,428 --> 00:15:14,830
We've come
to a dangerous place.

230
00:15:14,864 --> 00:15:18,501
We cannot fight a war
amongst ourselves.

231
00:15:19,403 --> 00:15:21,404
All right?

232
00:15:21,438 --> 00:15:25,374
Go on.
It's yours.

233
00:15:27,878 --> 00:15:29,778
I can keep it?

234
00:15:29,812 --> 00:15:32,981
Try not to stab
your sister with it.

235
00:15:41,555 --> 00:15:43,923
If you're going
to own a sword,

236
00:15:43,958 --> 00:15:45,825
you'd better
know how to use it.

237
00:15:53,632 --> 00:15:57,267
Don't listen to it.
Crows are all liars.

238
00:15:59,504 --> 00:16:03,106
- I know a story about a crow.
- I hate your stories.

239
00:16:03,141 --> 00:16:06,978
I know a story about a boy
who hated stories.

240
00:16:07,012 --> 00:16:10,382
I could tell you about
Ser Duncan the tall.

241
00:16:10,416 --> 00:16:12,384
Those were always
your favorites.

242
00:16:12,419 --> 00:16:14,787
Those weren't
my favorites.

243
00:16:14,821 --> 00:16:17,457
My favorites were
the scary ones.

244
00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:23,063
Oh, my sweet summer child.
What do you know about fear?

245
00:16:24,532 --> 00:16:26,333
Fear is for the winter,

246
00:16:26,368 --> 00:16:29,337
when the snows fall
a hundred feet deep.

247
00:16:29,371 --> 00:16:31,473
Fear is for the long night,

248
00:16:31,507 --> 00:16:34,476
when the Sun
hides for years

249
00:16:34,510 --> 00:16:37,246
and children are born
and live and die

250
00:16:37,281 --> 00:16:39,982
all in darkness.

251
00:16:40,017 --> 00:16:43,052
That is the time for fear,
my little lord,

252
00:16:43,087 --> 00:16:46,422
when the White Walkers
move through the woods.

253
00:16:47,791 --> 00:16:50,960
Thousands of years ago
there came a night

254
00:16:50,995 --> 00:16:53,096
that lasted a generation.

255
00:16:53,130 --> 00:16:56,066
Kings froze to death
in their castles,

256
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:58,334
same as the Shepherds
in their huts.

257
00:16:58,369 --> 00:17:01,238
And women smothered
their babies

258
00:17:01,272 --> 00:17:03,407
<i>rather than see them starve,</i>

259
00:17:03,441 --> 00:17:07,444
and wept and felt the tears
freeze on their cheeks.

260
00:17:07,479 --> 00:17:11,182
So is this the sort
of story that you like?

261
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:16,321
In that darkness,

262
00:17:16,356 --> 00:17:18,858
the White Walkers
came for the first time.

263
00:17:18,892 --> 00:17:22,027
<i>They swept through cities</i>
<i>and Kingdoms,</i>

264
00:17:22,062 --> 00:17:24,229
<i>riding their dead horses,</i>

265
00:17:24,263 --> 00:17:28,199
hunting with their packs of pale spiders
big as Hounds--

266
00:17:34,539 --> 00:17:36,973
Only what what the little lord
telling wants to hear.

267
00:17:37,008 --> 00:17:39,476
Get your supper.
I want some time with him.

268
00:17:50,254 --> 00:17:52,656
One time she told me

269
00:17:52,690 --> 00:17:54,959
the sky is blue because
we live inside the eye

270
00:17:54,993 --> 00:17:57,828
of a blue-eyed giant
named Macomber.

271
00:17:57,863 --> 00:18:00,097
Maybe we do.

272
00:18:02,433 --> 00:18:04,768
How do you feel?

273
00:18:08,138 --> 00:18:10,272
You still don't
remember anything?

274
00:18:12,209 --> 00:18:14,210
Bran,

275
00:18:14,244 --> 00:18:16,411
I've seen you climb
a thousand times.

276
00:18:16,446 --> 00:18:18,313
In the wind, in the rain--

277
00:18:18,348 --> 00:18:20,448
a thousand times.

278
00:18:20,482 --> 00:18:22,850
- You never fall.
- I did though.

279
00:18:25,821 --> 00:18:28,088
It's true, isn't it,

280
00:18:28,123 --> 00:18:31,459
what Maester Luwin
says about my legs?

281
00:18:38,934 --> 00:18:40,969
I'd rather be dead.

282
00:18:42,271 --> 00:18:45,475
- Don't ever say that.
- I'd rather be dead.

283
00:18:57,122 --> 00:18:59,758
Fewer eyes
back here, my Lady.

284
00:18:59,792 --> 00:19:01,793
But still too many.

285
00:19:01,827 --> 00:19:04,462
It's nine years since I've
set foot in the capital.

286
00:19:04,496 --> 00:19:07,865
And no one knew who I was
the last time I came either.

287
00:19:11,402 --> 00:19:13,903
My Lady.

288
00:19:13,938 --> 00:19:17,206
Welcome to King's Landing, Lady Stark.
Would you mind following us?

289
00:19:17,241 --> 00:19:19,107
I would.
We've done nothing wrong.

290
00:19:19,142 --> 00:19:21,443
We've been instructed
to escort you into the city.

291
00:19:21,478 --> 00:19:23,278
Instructed?

292
00:19:23,313 --> 00:19:26,015
I don't know who's providing
your instructions, but--

293
00:19:26,049 --> 00:19:27,783
follow me, Lady Stark.

294
00:19:38,696 --> 00:19:41,499
Cat!
Go on.

295
00:19:41,533 --> 00:19:43,367
Go upstairs.

296
00:19:45,571 --> 00:19:48,272
You little worm!

297
00:19:48,307 --> 00:19:51,075
You take me for some
back-alley Sally

298
00:19:51,110 --> 00:19:52,543
you can drag into a--

299
00:19:54,447 --> 00:19:56,047
pssst!

300
00:19:58,083 --> 00:20:00,118
I meant no disrespect

301
00:20:00,152 --> 00:20:02,520
to you of all people.

302
00:20:02,554 --> 00:20:04,688
How dare you
bring me here!

303
00:20:04,723 --> 00:20:06,523
Have you
lost your mind?

304
00:20:06,558 --> 00:20:09,193
No one will come looking for you here.
Isn't that what you wanted?

305
00:20:09,227 --> 00:20:12,763
I'm truly sorry
about the locale.

306
00:20:12,797 --> 00:20:15,266
How did you know I was
coming to King's Landing?

307
00:20:16,368 --> 00:20:18,369
A dear friend told me.

308
00:20:20,004 --> 00:20:22,839
- Lady Stark.
- Lord Varys.

309
00:20:22,874 --> 00:20:26,876
To see you again after so
many years is a blessing.

310
00:20:26,911 --> 00:20:28,411
Your poor hands.

311
00:20:30,847 --> 00:20:32,448
How did you know
I was coming?

312
00:20:32,482 --> 00:20:34,950
Knowledge is
my trade, my Lady.

313
00:20:36,752 --> 00:20:39,287
Did you bring the dagger with you,
by any chance?

314
00:20:40,889 --> 00:20:43,290
My little birds
are everywhere...

315
00:20:43,324 --> 00:20:45,559
Even in the North.

316
00:20:45,593 --> 00:20:49,129
They whisper to me
the strangest stories.

317
00:20:54,535 --> 00:20:56,603
Valyrian steel.

318
00:20:56,637 --> 00:20:59,406
Do you know whose dagger
this is?

319
00:21:00,608 --> 00:21:02,843
I must admit
I do not.

320
00:21:02,877 --> 00:21:06,746
Well well, this is
an historic day.

321
00:21:06,781 --> 00:21:08,882
Something you don't know

322
00:21:08,916 --> 00:21:11,384
<i>that I do.</i>

323
00:21:13,353 --> 00:21:17,223
There's only one dagger like this
in all of the Seven Kingdoms.

324
00:21:18,659 --> 00:21:21,227
- It's mine.
- Yours?

325
00:21:21,261 --> 00:21:25,831
At least it was, until the tournament on
Prince Joffrey's last Nameday.

326
00:21:25,866 --> 00:21:28,701
I bet on Ser Jaime
in the jousting,

327
00:21:28,735 --> 00:21:30,537
as any sane man would.

328
00:21:30,571 --> 00:21:33,072
When the Knight of the Flowers
unseated him,

329
00:21:33,107 --> 00:21:35,676
I lost this dagger.

330
00:21:35,710 --> 00:21:37,878
To whom?

331
00:21:37,912 --> 00:21:39,780
Tyrion Lannister.

332
00:21:39,815 --> 00:21:41,983
The imp.

333
00:21:42,017 --> 00:21:44,819
<i>Grenn, show him what</i>
<i>you farm boys are made of.</i>

334
00:21:50,192 --> 00:21:53,160
If that were a real sword,
you'd be dead.

335
00:21:53,195 --> 00:21:56,463
Lord Snow here
grew up in a castle

336
00:21:56,498 --> 00:21:58,799
spitting down
on the likes of you.

337
00:21:58,833 --> 00:22:00,935
Pyp.

338
00:22:00,969 --> 00:22:02,971
Do you think
Ned Stark's bastard

339
00:22:03,005 --> 00:22:05,040
bleeds
like the rest of us?

340
00:22:12,314 --> 00:22:13,982
Next!

341
00:22:24,595 --> 00:22:26,195
<i>Next!</i>

342
00:22:39,808 --> 00:22:41,509
Well, Lord Snow,

343
00:22:41,543 --> 00:22:44,044
<i>it appears you're</i>
<i>the least useless person here.</i>

344
00:22:45,246 --> 00:22:46,680
Go clean yourselves up.

345
00:22:46,714 --> 00:22:49,617
<i>There's only so much</i>
<i>I can stomach in a day.</i>

346
00:22:49,651 --> 00:22:52,620
A charming man.

347
00:22:52,654 --> 00:22:54,755
<i>I don't need him</i>
<i>to be charming.</i>

348
00:22:54,789 --> 00:22:57,458
I need him to turn this bunch
of thieves and runaways

349
00:22:57,493 --> 00:22:59,327
into men
of The Night's Watch.

350
00:22:59,361 --> 00:23:02,163
And how's that going,
commander Mormont?

351
00:23:02,198 --> 00:23:04,566
Slowly.

352
00:23:06,836 --> 00:23:08,470
A raven came

353
00:23:08,505 --> 00:23:10,406
for Ned Stark's son.

354
00:23:13,978 --> 00:23:16,480
Good news or bad?

355
00:23:16,514 --> 00:23:18,215
Both.

356
00:23:19,484 --> 00:23:22,652
Maester Pycelle:
<i>Lord Stark.</i>

357
00:23:22,687 --> 00:23:25,689
I meant to give you this earlier.

358
00:23:27,825 --> 00:23:30,027
So forgetful
these days.

359
00:23:31,862 --> 00:23:34,631
A raven from Winterfell
this morning.

360
00:23:45,341 --> 00:23:47,609
Good news?

361
00:23:50,980 --> 00:23:53,582
Perhaps you'd like to share it
with your wife?

362
00:23:56,119 --> 00:23:58,721
- My wife is in Winterfell.
- Is she?

363
00:24:06,730 --> 00:24:08,998
<i>Yes, I'm looking at you.</i>

364
00:24:12,302 --> 00:24:14,303
I thought that she'd
be safest in here.

365
00:24:14,338 --> 00:24:17,239
One of several such
establishments I own.

366
00:24:19,476 --> 00:24:20,944
You're a funny man.

367
00:24:20,978 --> 00:24:23,580
Huh?
A very funny man.

368
00:24:24,849 --> 00:24:26,149
Ned!

369
00:24:33,759 --> 00:24:35,560
Ah, the Starks--

370
00:24:35,595 --> 00:24:38,831
quick tempers,
slow minds.

371
00:24:43,604 --> 00:24:46,306
You broke
my nose, bastard!

372
00:24:53,547 --> 00:24:55,615
It's an improvement.

373
00:24:58,785 --> 00:25:01,954
If we threw you over The Wall,
I wonder how long it would take you to hit.

374
00:25:01,988 --> 00:25:04,023
I wonder if they'd find you
before the wolves did.

375
00:25:08,729 --> 00:25:10,830
What're you looking at,
half man?

376
00:25:10,864 --> 00:25:13,399
I'm looking
at you.

377
00:25:13,433 --> 00:25:15,701
<i>Yes.</i>

378
00:25:15,736 --> 00:25:18,804
<i>You've got</i>
<i>an interesting face.</i>

379
00:25:19,806 --> 00:25:23,009
Hmm, very
distinctive faces.

380
00:25:23,043 --> 00:25:24,677
All of you.

381
00:25:24,711 --> 00:25:26,913
And what do you care
about our faces?

382
00:25:26,947 --> 00:25:30,149
It's just I think
they would look marvelous

383
00:25:30,184 --> 00:25:32,819
decorating spikes
in King's Landing.

384
00:25:32,853 --> 00:25:35,988
Perhaps I'll write my sister,
the Queen, about it.

385
00:25:38,225 --> 00:25:40,560
We'll talk later,
Lord Snow.

386
00:25:46,233 --> 00:25:48,834
Everybody knew
what this place was

387
00:25:48,869 --> 00:25:50,837
and no one told me.

388
00:25:50,871 --> 00:25:53,273
No one but you.

389
00:25:53,307 --> 00:25:55,141
My father knew

390
00:25:55,176 --> 00:25:57,444
and he left me to rot
at The Wall all the same.

391
00:25:57,478 --> 00:25:59,112
Grenn's father
left him too...

392
00:25:59,147 --> 00:26:02,483
Outside a farmhouse
when he was three.

393
00:26:02,517 --> 00:26:06,387
<i>Pyp was caught stealing</i>
<i>a wheel of cheese.</i>

394
00:26:06,421 --> 00:26:09,824
His little sister hadn't
eaten in three days.

395
00:26:09,858 --> 00:26:13,595
He was given a choice:
His right hand or The Wall.

396
00:26:13,629 --> 00:26:16,163
I've been asking
the lord commander about them.

397
00:26:16,198 --> 00:26:17,551
Fascinating stories.

398
00:26:17,576 --> 00:26:19,300
They hate me because
I'm better than they are.

399
00:26:19,301 --> 00:26:21,336
It's a lucky thing
none of them were trained

400
00:26:21,370 --> 00:26:23,905
by a Master-at-Arms
like your Ser Rodrik.

401
00:26:23,939 --> 00:26:26,774
I don't imagine any of them
have ever held a real sword

402
00:26:26,808 --> 00:26:28,910
before they came here.

403
00:26:32,114 --> 00:26:34,081
Oh...

404
00:26:34,116 --> 00:26:37,151
Your brother Bran.

405
00:26:37,186 --> 00:26:39,487
He's woken up.

406
00:26:40,756 --> 00:26:42,857
The mere suggestion
that the queen's brother

407
00:26:42,891 --> 00:26:45,192
tried to kill your boy
would be considered treason.

408
00:26:45,227 --> 00:26:47,462
We have proof.
We have the blade.

409
00:26:47,496 --> 00:26:49,630
Which Lord Tyrion will say
was stolen from him.

410
00:26:49,665 --> 00:26:52,233
The only man who could say
otherwise has no throat,

411
00:26:52,267 --> 00:26:54,501
thanks to your boy's
wolf.

412
00:26:54,536 --> 00:26:57,504
Petyr has promised
to help us find the truth.

413
00:26:58,740 --> 00:27:00,641
He's like a little brother
to me, Ned.

414
00:27:00,676 --> 00:27:02,910
He would never
betray my trust.

415
00:27:02,944 --> 00:27:05,545
I'll try to keep you
alive, for her sake.

416
00:27:05,580 --> 00:27:07,214
A fool's task, admittedly,

417
00:27:07,248 --> 00:27:10,016
<i>but I've never been able</i>
<i>to refuse your wife anything.</i>

418
00:27:10,050 --> 00:27:12,184
I won't forget this.

419
00:27:12,219 --> 00:27:14,286
You're a true friend.

420
00:27:14,321 --> 00:27:17,589
Don't tell anyone.
I have a reputation to maintain.

421
00:27:21,761 --> 00:27:24,263
- How could you be so stupid?
- Calm down.

422
00:27:24,297 --> 00:27:26,131
He's a child--
10 years old.

423
00:27:26,165 --> 00:27:28,567
- What were you thinking?
- I was thinking of us.

424
00:27:28,601 --> 00:27:31,203
You're a bit late to start
complaining about it now.

425
00:27:31,237 --> 00:27:33,105
- What has the boy told them?
- Nothing.

426
00:27:33,139 --> 00:27:35,107
He's said nothing.
He remembers nothing.

427
00:27:35,141 --> 00:27:37,276
Then what are you
raving about?

428
00:27:37,310 --> 00:27:38,944
What if it
comes back to him?

429
00:27:38,979 --> 00:27:40,780
If he tells his father
what he saw--

430
00:27:40,814 --> 00:27:43,249
we'll say he was lying.
We'll say he was dreaming.

431
00:27:43,284 --> 00:27:44,818
We'll say
whatever we like.

432
00:27:44,852 --> 00:27:47,120
I think we can outfox
a 10-year-old.

433
00:27:47,155 --> 00:27:50,390
- And my husband?
- I'll go to war with him if I have to.

434
00:27:50,425 --> 00:27:53,194
They can write
a ballad about us:

435
00:27:53,228 --> 00:27:55,529
"The War
for Cersei's Cunt."

436
00:28:00,435 --> 00:28:02,437
- Let me go.
- Never.

437
00:28:02,471 --> 00:28:05,105
- Let me go.
- The boy

438
00:28:05,140 --> 00:28:07,407
won't talk.

439
00:28:07,442 --> 00:28:09,443
And if he does,
I'll kill him.

440
00:28:09,478 --> 00:28:12,913
Him, Ned Stark, the king-
the whole bloody lot of them,

441
00:28:12,947 --> 00:28:15,782
until you and I are
the only people

442
00:28:15,816 --> 00:28:18,017
left in this world.

443
00:28:28,428 --> 00:28:30,462
I wish I could
see the girls.

444
00:28:30,497 --> 00:28:33,732
- It's too dangerous.
- Just for a moment.

445
00:28:33,766 --> 00:28:36,034
Until we know
who our enemies are--

446
00:28:36,069 --> 00:28:38,270
I know they did it, Ned.
The Lannisters.

447
00:28:38,304 --> 00:28:40,305
In my bones,
I know it.

448
00:28:40,339 --> 00:28:42,340
Littlefinger's right.

449
00:28:43,943 --> 00:28:46,245
I can't do anything
without proof.

450
00:28:46,279 --> 00:28:48,814
And if you find the proof?

451
00:28:48,848 --> 00:28:51,049
Then I bring it to Robert...

452
00:28:51,084 --> 00:28:53,853
And hope he's still
the man I once knew.

453
00:28:55,622 --> 00:28:57,623
You watch yourself
on the road, huh?

454
00:28:57,658 --> 00:29:01,094
That temper of yours
is a dangerous thing.

455
00:29:01,128 --> 00:29:03,964
My temper?
Gods be good,

456
00:29:03,999 --> 00:29:06,767
you nearly killed
poor Littlefinger yesterday.

457
00:29:11,573 --> 00:29:13,274
He still loves you.

458
00:29:13,308 --> 00:29:16,344
Does he?

459
00:29:33,728 --> 00:29:35,562
Off with you.

460
00:30:07,359 --> 00:30:10,828
Yes, it's been a long time.

461
00:30:10,863 --> 00:30:14,598
But I still remember
every face.

462
00:30:16,167 --> 00:30:18,301
You remember
your first?

463
00:30:20,705 --> 00:30:22,873
Of course,
Your Grace.

464
00:30:22,907 --> 00:30:24,942
Who was it?

465
00:30:24,976 --> 00:30:27,111
A Tyroshi.

466
00:30:27,145 --> 00:30:29,413
- Never learned the name.
- Hmm.

467
00:30:29,447 --> 00:30:31,749
How'd you do it?

468
00:30:31,784 --> 00:30:33,851
Lance through
the heart.

469
00:30:33,886 --> 00:30:35,721
<i>Quick one.</i>

470
00:30:37,090 --> 00:30:39,458
Lucky for you.

471
00:30:39,492 --> 00:30:43,363
Mine was some Tarly boy
at the Battle of Summerhall.

472
00:30:44,832 --> 00:30:47,366
<i>My horse took an arrow</i>
<i>so I was on foot,</i>

473
00:30:47,401 --> 00:30:49,402
<i>slogging</i>
<i>through the mud.</i>

474
00:30:50,704 --> 00:30:56,042
He came running at me,
this dumb high-born lad,

475
00:30:56,076 --> 00:30:58,245
thinking he could end
the rebellion

476
00:30:58,279 --> 00:31:00,813
<i>with single swing</i>
<i>of his sword.</i>

477
00:31:02,149 --> 00:31:04,150
<i>I knocked him down</i>
<i>with the hammer.</i>

478
00:31:04,185 --> 00:31:06,553
<i>Gods, I was strong then.</i>

479
00:31:06,587 --> 00:31:09,423
Caved in his breastplate.

480
00:31:09,457 --> 00:31:12,626
Probably shattered
every rib he had.

481
00:31:12,661 --> 00:31:16,498
<i>Stood over him,</i>
<i>hammer in the air.</i>

482
00:31:16,532 --> 00:31:20,869
Right before I brought it down
he shouted, "wait!

483
00:31:20,904 --> 00:31:23,939
Wait."

484
00:31:28,277 --> 00:31:31,980
They never tell you
how they all shit themselves.

485
00:31:32,014 --> 00:31:36,550
They don't put that part
in the songs.

486
00:31:39,086 --> 00:31:41,588
Stupid boy.

487
00:31:42,690 --> 00:31:45,292
<i>Now the Tarlys</i>
<i>bend the knee</i>

488
00:31:45,326 --> 00:31:47,728
<i>like everyone else.</i>

489
00:31:47,762 --> 00:31:49,897
He could have lingered

490
00:31:49,931 --> 00:31:52,600
on the edge of the battle
with the smart boys

491
00:31:52,634 --> 00:31:56,237
and today his wife would
be making him miserable,

492
00:31:56,272 --> 00:31:59,241
<i>his sons would be ingrates,</i>

493
00:31:59,275 --> 00:32:02,311
and he'd be waking
three times in the night

494
00:32:02,345 --> 00:32:05,247
to piss into a bowl.
Wine!

495
00:32:08,250 --> 00:32:12,854
Lancel.
Gods, what a stupid name.

496
00:32:13,822 --> 00:32:17,425
Lancel Lannister.

497
00:32:17,459 --> 00:32:21,629
Who named you?
Some halfwit with a stutter?

498
00:32:24,032 --> 00:32:26,868
What are you doing?

499
00:32:28,270 --> 00:32:30,805
- It's empty, Your Grace.
- What do you mean it's empty?

500
00:32:30,839 --> 00:32:33,674
- There's no more wine.
- Is that what empty means?

501
00:32:35,744 --> 00:32:38,112
So get more.

502
00:32:41,783 --> 00:32:44,017
Tell your cousin
to get in here.

503
00:32:44,051 --> 00:32:45,452
Kingslayer!

504
00:32:45,486 --> 00:32:47,521
Get in here.

505
00:32:54,961 --> 00:32:58,163
<i>Surrounded</i>
<i>by Lannisters.</i>

506
00:32:58,197 --> 00:33:02,434
Every time I close my eyes
I see their blond hair

507
00:33:02,468 --> 00:33:05,737
and their smug,
satisfied faces.

508
00:33:05,771 --> 00:33:08,539
It must wound
your pride, huh?

509
00:33:08,574 --> 00:33:11,542
Standing out there
like a glorified sentry.

510
00:33:12,978 --> 00:33:16,848
Jaime Lannister,
son of the mighty Tywin...

511
00:33:18,117 --> 00:33:20,553
Forced to mind the door
while your King

512
00:33:20,587 --> 00:33:23,556
eats and drinks
and shits and fucks.

513
00:33:25,459 --> 00:33:27,059
So come on.

514
00:33:27,094 --> 00:33:29,194
We're telling war stories.

515
00:33:30,430 --> 00:33:34,066
Who was your first kill,
not counting old men?

516
00:33:35,301 --> 00:33:37,936
One of the outlaws
in the Brotherhood.

517
00:33:37,971 --> 00:33:40,539
I was there that day.

518
00:33:40,573 --> 00:33:43,742
You were only a squire,
16 years old.

519
00:33:43,776 --> 00:33:46,678
You killed Simon Toyne
with a counter riposte.

520
00:33:46,712 --> 00:33:48,980
Best move I ever saw.

521
00:33:49,014 --> 00:33:53,251
A good fighter, Toyne,
but he lacked stamina.

522
00:33:53,285 --> 00:33:55,420
<i>Your outlaw...</i>

523
00:33:55,455 --> 00:33:58,023
Any last words?

524
00:33:58,057 --> 00:34:00,892
- I cut his head off, so no.
- Hmmm.

525
00:34:00,927 --> 00:34:03,863
What about
Aerys Targaryen?

526
00:34:03,897 --> 00:34:07,833
What did the Mad King say
when you stabbed him in the back?

527
00:34:07,868 --> 00:34:09,936
I never asked.

528
00:34:09,970 --> 00:34:13,006
Did he call you
a traitor?

529
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:16,210
Did he plead
for a reprieve?

530
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:20,714
He said the same thing
he'd been saying for hours...

531
00:34:22,384 --> 00:34:24,584
"Burn them all."

532
00:34:29,356 --> 00:34:31,290
If that's all,
Your Grace...

533
00:35:03,554 --> 00:35:05,989
Do the Dothraki buy
their slaves?

534
00:35:06,023 --> 00:35:08,158
The Dothraki don't
believe in money.

535
00:35:08,192 --> 00:35:10,493
Most of their slaves were
given to them as gifts.

536
00:35:10,527 --> 00:35:12,762
- From whom?
- If you rule a city

537
00:35:12,796 --> 00:35:15,731
and you see the horde approaching,
you have two choices:

538
00:35:15,765 --> 00:35:17,599
Pay tribute or fight.

539
00:35:17,634 --> 00:35:19,334
An easy choice
for most.

540
00:35:19,368 --> 00:35:22,871
Of course, sometimes
it's not enough.

541
00:35:22,905 --> 00:35:26,341
Sometimes a Khal feels insulted
by the number of slaves he's given.

542
00:35:26,376 --> 00:35:28,944
<i>He might think the men too weak</i>
<i>or the women too ugly.</i>

543
00:35:28,979 --> 00:35:32,515
Sometimes a Khal decides his riders
haven't had a good fight in months

544
00:35:32,549 --> 00:35:35,852
- <i>and need the practice.</i>
- <i>Kash qoy qoyi thira disse.</i>

545
00:35:38,223 --> 00:35:40,991
Tell them all to stop.

546
00:35:41,026 --> 00:35:43,160
You want the entire
horde to stop?

547
00:35:43,194 --> 00:35:45,529
For how long?

548
00:35:45,563 --> 00:35:48,598
Until I command them
otherwise.

549
00:35:48,632 --> 00:35:51,000
You're learning
to talk like a Queen.

550
00:35:51,035 --> 00:35:53,102
Not a Queen.

551
00:35:53,137 --> 00:35:55,038
A Khaleesi.

552
00:36:05,282 --> 00:36:07,818
Annakhas dozgosores.

553
00:36:31,911 --> 00:36:34,012
You dare!

554
00:36:34,047 --> 00:36:37,517
You give commands to me?
To <i>me?</i>

555
00:36:39,353 --> 00:36:43,056
You do not command the Dragon.
I am Lord of the Seven Kingdoms.

556
00:36:43,090 --> 00:36:45,459
I don't take orders
from savages

557
00:36:45,493 --> 00:36:47,994
or their sluts.
Do you hear me?

558
00:36:50,698 --> 00:36:53,200
<i>Hash shafka zali nharees,</i>
<i>zhey Khaleesi?</i>

559
00:36:54,288 --> 00:36:55,887
Rakharo ask if you want
him dead, Khaleesi.

560
00:36:56,071 --> 00:36:57,539
No.

561
00:36:57,573 --> 00:36:59,574
<i>Ishish chare acharoe</i>
<i>hash me nem ?jervae</i>

562
00:36:59,609 --> 00:37:02,677
- <i>nharesoon.</i>
- Rakharo say you should take ear,

563
00:37:02,712 --> 00:37:06,381
- to teach respect.
- Please please, don't hurt him.

564
00:37:10,386 --> 00:37:14,121
Tell him I don't want
my brother harmed.

565
00:37:14,155 --> 00:37:17,023
<i>Khaleesi vos zalo</i>
<i>meme nem azisa.</i>

566
00:37:17,058 --> 00:37:19,459
Huh?

567
00:37:20,527 --> 00:37:23,195
<i>Shafki.</i>

568
00:37:26,934 --> 00:37:30,638
Mormont!
Kill these Dothraki dogs!

569
00:37:35,878 --> 00:37:37,746
I am your King!

570
00:37:39,783 --> 00:37:42,852
Shall we return
to the Khalasar, Khaleesi?

571
00:38:02,671 --> 00:38:05,005
Uh uh uh uh uh.

572
00:38:05,039 --> 00:38:08,142
You walk.

573
00:40:38,336 --> 00:40:42,805
I wanted to be here when you
saw it for the first time.

574
00:40:50,848 --> 00:40:54,250
- I'm leaving this morning.
- You're leaving?

575
00:40:55,319 --> 00:40:57,553
I'm the First Ranger.

576
00:40:57,588 --> 00:40:59,856
My job is out there.

577
00:40:59,890 --> 00:41:03,226
- There have been disturbing reports.
- What kind of reports?

578
00:41:03,260 --> 00:41:05,161
The kind I don't
want to believe.

579
00:41:06,797 --> 00:41:09,299
I'm ready.
I won't let you down.

580
00:41:09,333 --> 00:41:11,868
You're not going.

581
00:41:14,338 --> 00:41:16,106
You're no Ranger, Jon.

582
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:18,875
- But I'm better than every--
- Better than no one!

583
00:41:24,048 --> 00:41:25,915
Here...

584
00:41:25,949 --> 00:41:28,284
A man gets what he earns,

585
00:41:28,318 --> 00:41:30,486
when he earns it.

586
00:41:34,425 --> 00:41:36,659
We'll speak when I return.

587
00:41:52,108 --> 00:41:55,311
- A bear's balls.
- Tyrion: Oh, you're joking?

588
00:41:55,345 --> 00:41:58,882
And his brains and his guts,
his lungs and his heart

589
00:41:58,916 --> 00:42:01,418
all fried in his own fat.

590
00:42:01,452 --> 00:42:04,054
When you're a hundred miles
North of The Wall

591
00:42:04,089 --> 00:42:07,590
and you ate your last meal a week ago,
you leave nothing for the wolves.

592
00:42:07,625 --> 00:42:10,894
And how do
a bear's balls taste?

593
00:42:10,929 --> 00:42:13,230
A bit chewy.

594
00:42:15,333 --> 00:42:18,869
And what about you, my Lord?
What's the strangest thing you've eaten?

595
00:42:18,903 --> 00:42:21,271
Do Dornish girls count?

596
00:42:25,242 --> 00:42:28,377
So you roam
the Seven Kingdoms,

597
00:42:28,411 --> 00:42:30,612
collaring pickpockets
and horse thieves

598
00:42:30,646 --> 00:42:32,747
and bringing them here
as eager recruits?

599
00:42:32,782 --> 00:42:34,582
Aye.

600
00:42:34,617 --> 00:42:37,618
But it's not all of 'em's
done bad things.

601
00:42:37,653 --> 00:42:40,654
Some of 'em's just poor lads
looking for steady feed.

602
00:42:40,689 --> 00:42:43,390
Some of 'em's high-born lads
looking for glory.

603
00:42:43,424 --> 00:42:45,609
They have a better chance
finding feed than glory.

604
00:42:46,994 --> 00:42:50,530
The Night's Watch is
a joke to you, is it?

605
00:42:50,564 --> 00:42:53,100
Is that what we are,
Lannister?

606
00:42:53,134 --> 00:42:55,969
An army of jesters
in black?

607
00:42:56,003 --> 00:42:58,138
You don't have enough men
to be an army

608
00:42:58,172 --> 00:43:01,808
and aside from Yoren here,
none of you are particularly funny.

609
00:43:01,843 --> 00:43:04,578
<i>I hope we've provided you</i>
<i>with some good stories to tell</i>

610
00:43:04,613 --> 00:43:06,547
<i>when you're back</i>
<i>in King's Landing.</i>

611
00:43:06,582 --> 00:43:08,116
But something to think about

612
00:43:08,150 --> 00:43:10,251
while you're drinking
your wine down there,

613
00:43:10,286 --> 00:43:12,220
enjoying your brothels--

614
00:43:12,255 --> 00:43:16,592
half the boys you've seen training
will die North of The Wall.

615
00:43:16,627 --> 00:43:20,096
<i>Might be a Wilding's axe</i>
<i>that gets them,</i>

616
00:43:20,130 --> 00:43:22,798
<i>might be sickness,</i>

617
00:43:22,833 --> 00:43:25,667
might just be the cold.

618
00:43:25,702 --> 00:43:28,403
They die in pain.

619
00:43:28,437 --> 00:43:31,973
And they do it so plump
little lords like you

620
00:43:32,007 --> 00:43:35,476
can enjoy their summer afternoons
in peace and comfort.

621
00:43:37,478 --> 00:43:39,479
Do you think
I'm plump?

622
00:43:43,217 --> 00:43:45,618
Listen, Benjen--
may I call you Benjen?

623
00:43:45,653 --> 00:43:46,639
<i>Call me what you like.</i>

624
00:43:46,664 --> 00:43:48,850
<i>I'm not sure what I've</i>
<i>done to offend you.</i>

625
00:43:49,390 --> 00:43:51,558
I have great admiration
for The Night's Watch.

626
00:43:51,592 --> 00:43:54,161
I've great admiration
for you as First Ranger.

627
00:43:54,195 --> 00:43:56,229
You know, my brother
once told me

628
00:43:56,264 --> 00:43:58,866
that nothing someone says
before the word "but"

629
00:43:58,900 --> 00:44:00,800
really counts.

630
00:44:00,835 --> 00:44:03,337
But...

631
00:44:03,371 --> 00:44:06,606
I don't believe that Giants and Ghouls
and White Walkers

632
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:08,441
are lurking
beyond The Wall.

633
00:44:08,475 --> 00:44:10,843
I believe that
the only difference

634
00:44:10,878 --> 00:44:13,145
between us and
the Wildlings is that

635
00:44:13,179 --> 00:44:15,514
when The Wall went up,
our ancestors happened

636
00:44:15,549 --> 00:44:17,782
to live on
the right side of it.

637
00:44:17,817 --> 00:44:19,717
You're right.

638
00:44:21,320 --> 00:44:23,421
The Wildlings are
no different from us.

639
00:44:23,455 --> 00:44:26,324
A little rougher maybe.

640
00:44:26,358 --> 00:44:29,127
But they're made
of meat and bone.

641
00:44:29,162 --> 00:44:31,764
I know how to track them
and I know how to kill them.

642
00:44:31,798 --> 00:44:35,735
It's not the Wildlings
giving me sleepless nights.

643
00:44:36,871 --> 00:44:39,039
You've never been
North of The Wall,

644
00:44:39,073 --> 00:44:41,475
so don't tell me
what's out there.

645
00:44:44,980 --> 00:44:47,014
Are you going below?

646
00:44:48,516 --> 00:44:51,885
- Keep well, keep warm.
- Enjoy the capital, brother.

647
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:54,421
Oh, I always do.

648
00:45:02,764 --> 00:45:05,032
I think he's starting
to like me.

649
00:45:07,770 --> 00:45:11,239
- "Going below"?
- Aye.

650
00:45:11,274 --> 00:45:12,908
Into the tunnel

651
00:45:12,942 --> 00:45:15,078
and out the other side.

652
00:45:15,112 --> 00:45:17,848
He'll be North of The Wall
for a month or two.

653
00:45:19,984 --> 00:45:23,153
So you're heading down
to King's Landing too.

654
00:45:23,188 --> 00:45:25,756
Aye, day after tomorrow.

655
00:45:25,791 --> 00:45:29,594
I get about half of my recruits
from their dungeons.

656
00:45:29,628 --> 00:45:33,898
Let's share the road.
I could use some decent company.

657
00:45:33,933 --> 00:45:38,971
I... I travel a bit
on the grubby side, my Lord.

658
00:45:39,005 --> 00:45:40,359
Not this time.

659
00:45:40,384 --> 00:45:42,412
We'll be staying at
the finest castles and inns.

660
00:45:43,043 --> 00:45:45,778
No one turns away
a Lannister.

661
00:45:51,284 --> 00:45:53,551
At Jakar?

662
00:45:53,586 --> 00:45:55,386
<i>Athjahakar.</i>

663
00:45:55,420 --> 00:45:57,655
Ath ja haker.

664
00:45:57,689 --> 00:45:59,623
<i>Athjahakar.</i>

665
00:45:59,657 --> 00:46:01,525
<i>Athjahakar.</i>

666
00:46:01,559 --> 00:46:03,326
Yes, Khaleesi.

667
00:46:05,096 --> 00:46:07,330
Oh, what are you doing?

668
00:46:07,365 --> 00:46:09,966
When was last time
you bleed, Khaleesi?

669
00:46:12,403 --> 00:46:14,437
You change, Khaleesi.

670
00:46:23,482 --> 00:46:26,351
For a man on horseback,
the curved blade

671
00:46:26,385 --> 00:46:28,887
is a good thing,
easier to handle.

672
00:46:28,921 --> 00:46:32,391
It's a good weapon
for a Dothrakan.

673
00:46:32,425 --> 00:46:35,194
But a man in full plate--

674
00:46:35,228 --> 00:46:37,029
<i>shori tawakof</i>

675
00:46:37,064 --> 00:46:40,032
the <i>arakh</i> won't get
through the steel.

676
00:46:41,268 --> 00:46:43,369
That's where the broadsword
has the advantage.

677
00:46:43,404 --> 00:46:46,406
Designed for piercing plate.

678
00:46:50,577 --> 00:46:53,812
- Armor.
- Armor.

679
00:46:53,846 --> 00:46:56,481
Armor make a man...

680
00:46:56,515 --> 00:46:58,649
- <i>Vroz?</i>
- Slow.

681
00:46:58,683 --> 00:47:00,617
- Slow.
- It's true,

682
00:47:00,652 --> 00:47:03,953
but it also keeps
a man alive.

683
00:47:21,874 --> 00:47:24,375
He still is.

684
00:47:24,410 --> 00:47:26,878
A man of great honor

685
00:47:26,912 --> 00:47:28,880
and I betrayed him.

686
00:47:52,505 --> 00:47:54,973
I don't think
she wants to eat dog.

687
00:47:58,244 --> 00:48:01,012
The Khaleesi
have baby inside her.

688
00:48:02,548 --> 00:48:05,718
<i>It is true.</i>
<i>She does not bleed for two moons.</i>

689
00:48:05,752 --> 00:48:08,287
<i>Her belly start</i>
<i>to swell.</i>

690
00:48:10,224 --> 00:48:14,127
<i>She does not want to eat horse.</i>

691
00:48:15,530 --> 00:48:18,433
I'll have the boys
butcher a goat for supper.

692
00:48:23,606 --> 00:48:26,274
I need to ride to Qohor.

693
00:48:29,211 --> 00:48:33,214
Uh, we ride
for Vaes Dothrak.

694
00:48:33,249 --> 00:48:35,583
Don't worry.
I'll catch you.

695
00:48:35,617 --> 00:48:38,052
The horde's easy to find.

696
00:48:48,530 --> 00:48:50,431
Don't stand so still.

697
00:48:50,465 --> 00:48:54,001
It's harder to hit
a moving target.

698
00:48:58,173 --> 00:49:01,008
Except for you.
You move too much.

699
00:49:01,042 --> 00:49:03,744
I could just hold my sword out
and let you do the work for me.

700
00:49:08,916 --> 00:49:11,884
Maester Aemon:
<i>How many winters have</i>
<i>you seen, Lord Tyrion?</i>

701
00:49:11,919 --> 00:49:14,553
Eight-- no, nine.

702
00:49:14,587 --> 00:49:17,122
All of them brief?

703
00:49:17,156 --> 00:49:20,391
They say the winter of my birth
was three years long, Maester Aemon.

704
00:49:20,426 --> 00:49:23,461
This summer
has lasted nine.

705
00:49:23,495 --> 00:49:27,831
But reports from the Citadel
tell us the days grow shorter.

706
00:49:27,865 --> 00:49:30,300
The Starks are always
right eventually:

707
00:49:30,334 --> 00:49:33,303
Winter is coming.

708
00:49:33,337 --> 00:49:36,138
This one will be long

709
00:49:36,172 --> 00:49:38,874
and dark things
will come with it.

710
00:49:38,908 --> 00:49:41,977
We've been
capturing Wildlings,

711
00:49:42,011 --> 00:49:45,046
more every month.
They're fleeing south.

712
00:49:45,081 --> 00:49:49,318
<i>The ones who flee say they've seen</i>
<i>the White Walkers.</i>

713
00:49:49,352 --> 00:49:52,756
Yes, and the fishermen of Lannisport
say they see mermaids.

714
00:49:52,790 --> 00:49:56,193
One of our own Rangers swore
he saw them kill his companions.

715
00:49:56,227 --> 00:49:58,295
He swore it right up
to the moment

716
00:49:58,330 --> 00:50:00,231
Ned Stark
chopped his head off.

717
00:50:00,265 --> 00:50:02,901
<i>The Night's Watch</i>
<i>is the only thing</i>

718
00:50:02,935 --> 00:50:04,969
standing between the realm

719
00:50:05,004 --> 00:50:07,271
and what lies beyond.

720
00:50:07,306 --> 00:50:09,507
<i>And it has has</i>
<i>become an army</i>

721
00:50:09,541 --> 00:50:13,143
of undisciplined boys
and tired old men.

722
00:50:13,178 --> 00:50:16,712
There are less than
a thousand of us now.

723
00:50:16,747 --> 00:50:19,582
We can't man the other
castles on The Wall.

724
00:50:19,616 --> 00:50:22,718
<i>We can't properly</i>
<i>patrol the wilderness.</i>

725
00:50:22,752 --> 00:50:26,421
We've barely enough resources
to keep our lads armed

726
00:50:26,456 --> 00:50:29,091
- and fed.
- Your sister

727
00:50:29,125 --> 00:50:31,927
sits by the side the King.

728
00:50:31,962 --> 00:50:34,830
Tell her we need help.

729
00:50:34,865 --> 00:50:37,200
<i>When winter does come,</i>

730
00:50:37,234 --> 00:50:40,670
gods help us all
if we're not ready.

731
00:51:47,407 --> 00:51:49,842
I'm sorry to see
you leave, Lannister.

732
00:51:51,578 --> 00:51:53,513
It's either me
or this cold.

733
00:51:53,547 --> 00:51:55,915
And <i>it</i> doesn't appear
to be going anywhere.

734
00:51:55,949 --> 00:51:58,918
Will you stop at Winterfell
on your way south?

735
00:51:58,953 --> 00:52:00,186
I expect I will.

736
00:52:00,220 --> 00:52:02,255
Gods know there aren't
many feather beds

737
00:52:02,289 --> 00:52:04,423
between here
and King's Landing.

738
00:52:04,458 --> 00:52:06,592
If you see
my brother Bran,

739
00:52:06,627 --> 00:52:09,162
tell him I miss him.

740
00:52:09,196 --> 00:52:11,230
Tell him I'd visit
if I could.

741
00:52:11,264 --> 00:52:12,832
Of course.

742
00:52:12,866 --> 00:52:15,435
He'll never walk again.

743
00:52:15,469 --> 00:52:17,136
If you're going to be
a cripple,

744
00:52:17,170 --> 00:52:19,405
it's better to be
a rich cripple.

745
00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:21,908
You take care, Snow.

746
00:52:21,942 --> 00:52:23,943
Farewell, my Lord.

747
00:52:35,688 --> 00:52:38,257
You are late, boy.

748
00:52:40,126 --> 00:52:42,627
<i>Tomorrow you will</i>
<i>be here at midday.</i>

749
00:52:42,661 --> 00:52:44,895
Who are you?

750
00:52:44,930 --> 00:52:47,398
Your dancing master,

751
00:52:47,432 --> 00:52:49,000
<i>Syrio Forel.</i>

752
00:52:53,105 --> 00:52:54,605
Tomorrow
you will catch it.

753
00:52:54,640 --> 00:52:56,641
Now pick it up.

754
00:52:58,944 --> 00:53:01,246
That is not
the way, boy.

755
00:53:01,280 --> 00:53:05,451
This is not a greatsword that is
needing two hands to swing it.

756
00:53:05,485 --> 00:53:09,622
- It's too heavy.
- It is heavy as it needs to be

757
00:53:09,657 --> 00:53:11,525
to make you strong.

758
00:53:12,427 --> 00:53:13,961
Just so.

759
00:53:13,995 --> 00:53:16,430
One hand is all
that is needed.

760
00:53:17,666 --> 00:53:19,801
Now you are standing
all wrong.

761
00:53:19,835 --> 00:53:22,204
Turn your body sideface.

762
00:53:22,238 --> 00:53:24,673
Yes.

763
00:53:24,707 --> 00:53:26,876
So.

764
00:53:26,910 --> 00:53:29,244
You are skinny.
That is good.

765
00:53:29,279 --> 00:53:32,281
The target is smaller.

766
00:53:32,315 --> 00:53:34,383
Now the grip--
let me see.

767
00:53:34,417 --> 00:53:37,185
Yes.

768
00:53:37,220 --> 00:53:40,055
The grip must be
delicate.

769
00:53:41,023 --> 00:53:42,924
What if I drop it?

770
00:53:42,959 --> 00:53:45,293
The steel must be
part of your arm.

771
00:53:45,327 --> 00:53:48,063
Can you drop
part of your arm? No.

772
00:53:48,097 --> 00:53:52,333
Nine years Syrio Forel was first sword
to the Sealord of Braavos.

773
00:53:52,368 --> 00:53:55,136
He knows these things.
You must listen to me, boy.

774
00:53:55,170 --> 00:53:56,938
I'm a girl.

775
00:53:56,972 --> 00:54:00,542
Boy, girl--
you are a sword,

776
00:54:00,576 --> 00:54:03,478
that is all.

777
00:54:03,512 --> 00:54:05,914
That is the grip.

778
00:54:05,949 --> 00:54:08,117
You are not holding
a battle-axe.

779
00:54:08,151 --> 00:54:10,486
- You are holding--
- A Needle.

780
00:54:10,521 --> 00:54:11,521
Ahhh.

781
00:54:13,190 --> 00:54:15,792
Just so.

782
00:54:15,827 --> 00:54:18,662
Now we will begin the dance.

783
00:54:18,697 --> 00:54:20,164
Remember, child,

784
00:54:20,198 --> 00:54:23,167
this is not the dance of the Westeros
we are learning--

785
00:54:23,201 --> 00:54:25,336
the Knight's Dance,

786
00:54:25,370 --> 00:54:27,771
hacking and hammering.

787
00:54:27,806 --> 00:54:30,941
This is the Bravo's Dance...

788
00:54:32,444 --> 00:54:34,411
The Water Dance.

789
00:54:34,445 --> 00:54:36,680
It is swift

790
00:54:36,714 --> 00:54:38,982
and sudden.

791
00:54:40,451 --> 00:54:42,752
All men are made of water,

792
00:54:42,787 --> 00:54:44,521
do you know this?

793
00:54:44,555 --> 00:54:46,857
If you pierce them,

794
00:54:46,891 --> 00:54:50,660
the water leaks out
and they die.

795
00:54:51,828 --> 00:54:55,164
Now you will try
to strike me.

796
00:54:58,201 --> 00:55:00,001
Ha!

797
00:55:11,715 --> 00:55:13,215
Up!

798
00:55:16,586 --> 00:55:17,686
Ha!

799
00:55:28,931 --> 00:55:30,298
Ah.

800
00:55:32,735 --> 00:55:34,302
Dead.

801
00:55:34,336 --> 00:55:35,436
Oh!

802
00:55:35,471 --> 00:55:37,071
Dead.

803
00:55:37,106 --> 00:55:39,140
<i><i>Hup!</i>

804
00:55:41,710 --> 00:55:43,711
Very dead.

805
00:55:43,745 --> 00:55:46,280
Come.

806
00:55:46,314 --> 00:55:48,182
Ah ah ah!

807
00:55:48,216 --> 00:55:51,185
<i>Hup!</i>

808
00:55:51,219 --> 00:55:53,220
Again, faster.

809
00:55:58,259 --> 00:56:00,160
Ah.
