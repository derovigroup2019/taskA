1
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:06,339
Clegane, look into the flames.

2
00:00:06,589 --> 00:00:07,880
What do you see?

3
00:00:07,881 --> 00:00:09,672
A wall of ice.

4
00:00:10,756 --> 00:00:12,088
The Wall.

5
00:00:13,714 --> 00:00:15,379
The only thing standing
between us

6
00:00:15,380 --> 00:00:17,046
and the army of the dead
is the Wall,

7
00:00:17,047 --> 00:00:19,839
and the Wall hasn't been
properly manned in centuries.

8
00:00:20,172 --> 00:00:21,630
Last time we saw
The Night King,

9
00:00:21,631 --> 00:00:22,672
it was at Hardhome.

10
00:00:23,088 --> 00:00:25,921
Closest castle to Hardhome
is Eastwatch by the sea.

11
00:00:25,922 --> 00:00:27,682
And that's where I'll go.

12
00:00:27,963 --> 00:00:30,505
Looks like we're
the Nightswatch now.

13
00:00:34,047 --> 00:00:36,881
This suits you, Lady Stark.

14
00:00:37,839 --> 00:00:40,297
- Jon left you in charge?
- He did.

15
00:00:50,464 --> 00:00:53,339
- Lord Tarly.
- I believe you know my son.

16
00:00:53,547 --> 00:00:55,005
Do you fight with us...

17
00:00:55,797 --> 00:00:57,963
or with the fallen savages
and eunuchs?

18
00:00:59,589 --> 00:01:01,338
What do you think I should do?

19
00:01:01,339 --> 00:01:04,088
If you use them to melt castles
and burn cities,

20
00:01:04,422 --> 00:01:05,505
you're not different.

21
00:01:05,922 --> 00:01:07,589
You're just more of the same.

22
00:01:09,422 --> 00:01:10,756
Listen.

23
00:03:47,922 --> 00:03:49,130
You could've killed me.

24
00:03:57,589 --> 00:03:59,588
The fuck were you doing
back there?

25
00:03:59,589 --> 00:04:01,880
Ending the war.

26
00:04:01,881 --> 00:04:04,087
Killing her.

27
00:04:04,088 --> 00:04:06,505
You saw the dragon
between you and her?

28
00:04:09,631 --> 00:04:12,505
And?

29
00:04:19,255 --> 00:04:21,087
Listen to me, cunt.

30
00:04:21,088 --> 00:04:22,630
Till I get
what I'm owed,

31
00:04:22,631 --> 00:04:24,463
a dragon doesn't
get to kill you,

32
00:04:24,464 --> 00:04:26,338
you don't
get to kill you,

33
00:04:26,339 --> 00:04:27,797
only I get
to kill you.

34
00:04:30,922 --> 00:04:33,796
That was only
one of them.

35
00:04:33,797 --> 00:04:36,630
She has two more.

36
00:04:36,631 --> 00:04:39,713
If she decides to use them,
to really use them...

37
00:04:39,714 --> 00:04:42,338
- You're fucked.
- Don't you mean we're fucked?

38
00:04:42,339 --> 00:04:44,338
No, I do not.

39
00:04:44,339 --> 00:04:47,504
Dragons are where
our partnership ends.

40
00:04:47,505 --> 00:04:49,129
I'm not gonna be around
when those things

41
00:04:49,130 --> 00:04:50,881
start spitting fire
on King's Landing.

42
00:04:52,922 --> 00:04:54,380
I have to tell
Cersei.

43
00:04:57,213 --> 00:04:59,172
May as well jump
back in that river.

44
00:06:13,547 --> 00:06:16,504
I know what Cersei
has told you.

45
00:06:16,505 --> 00:06:21,254
That I've come
to destroy your cities,

46
00:06:21,255 --> 00:06:22,504
burn down your homes,

47
00:06:22,505 --> 00:06:24,255
murder you,
and orphan your children.

48
00:06:27,088 --> 00:06:30,880
That's Cersei Lannister,
not me.

49
00:06:30,881 --> 00:06:33,087
I'm not here
to murder,

50
00:06:33,088 --> 00:06:34,838
and all I want
to destroy

51
00:06:34,839 --> 00:06:37,921
is the wheel that has
rolled over rich and poor

52
00:06:37,922 --> 00:06:42,130
to the benefit of no one but the
Cersei Lannisters of the world.

53
00:06:43,339 --> 00:06:45,588
I offer you a choice...

54
00:06:45,589 --> 00:06:47,921
bend the knee
and join me.

55
00:06:47,922 --> 00:06:52,087
Together, we will leave the world
a better place than we found it.

56
00:06:52,088 --> 00:06:55,087
Or refuse...

57
00:06:55,088 --> 00:06:56,589
and die.

58
00:07:25,589 --> 00:07:27,130
Step forward,
my lord.

59
00:07:36,297 --> 00:07:38,254
You will not kneel?

60
00:07:38,255 --> 00:07:39,631
I already have
a queen.

61
00:07:40,839 --> 00:07:42,338
My sister.

62
00:07:42,339 --> 00:07:43,546
She wasn't your queen

63
00:07:43,547 --> 00:07:45,588
until recently,
though, was she?

64
00:07:45,589 --> 00:07:47,921
When she murdered
your rightful queen

65
00:07:47,922 --> 00:07:50,546
and destroyed House Tyrell
for all time.

66
00:07:50,547 --> 00:07:53,839
So it appears your allegiances
are somewhat flexible.

67
00:07:54,963 --> 00:07:57,880
There are
no easy choices in war.

68
00:07:57,881 --> 00:08:00,254
Say what you will
about your sister,

69
00:08:00,255 --> 00:08:02,755
she was born
in Westeros.

70
00:08:02,756 --> 00:08:05,005
She's lived here
all her life.

71
00:08:07,005 --> 00:08:09,838
You, on the other hand,

72
00:08:09,839 --> 00:08:12,588
murdered your own father

73
00:08:12,589 --> 00:08:15,713
and chose to support
a foreign invader.

74
00:08:15,714 --> 00:08:18,547
One with no ties
to this land...

75
00:08:20,172 --> 00:08:22,547
with an army of savages
at her back.

76
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:26,213
You will not trade
your honor for your life.

77
00:08:28,213 --> 00:08:29,671
I respect that.

78
00:08:29,672 --> 00:08:32,713
Perhaps he could take
the Black, Your Grace.

79
00:08:32,714 --> 00:08:35,129
Whatever else he is,
he is a true soldier.

80
00:08:35,130 --> 00:08:37,379
He'd be invaluable
at the Wall.

81
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:39,714
You cannot send me
to the Wall.

82
00:08:41,088 --> 00:08:42,714
You are not my queen.

83
00:08:56,172 --> 00:08:57,504
You will have
to kill me, too.

84
00:08:57,505 --> 00:08:59,380
Step back
and shut your mouth.

85
00:09:00,922 --> 00:09:02,338
Who are you?

86
00:09:02,339 --> 00:09:03,589
A stupid boy.

87
00:09:04,714 --> 00:09:06,921
I am Dickon Tarly,

88
00:09:06,922 --> 00:09:08,338
son of Randyll Tarly.

89
00:09:08,339 --> 00:09:10,546
You are the future
of your house.

90
00:09:10,547 --> 00:09:13,921
This war has already wiped one
great house from the world.

91
00:09:13,922 --> 00:09:15,797
Don't let it happen again.
Bend the knee.

92
00:09:23,464 --> 00:09:24,922
I will not.

93
00:09:29,255 --> 00:09:32,962
Your Grace, nothing scrubs
bold notions from a man's head

94
00:09:32,963 --> 00:09:34,546
like a few weeks
in a dark cell.

95
00:09:34,547 --> 00:09:37,212
I meant what I said.

96
00:09:37,213 --> 00:09:38,755
I'm not here
to put men in chains.

97
00:09:38,756 --> 00:09:41,087
If that becomes an option,
many will take it.

98
00:09:41,088 --> 00:09:42,464
I gave them a choice.

99
00:09:43,963 --> 00:09:45,296
They made it.

100
00:09:45,297 --> 00:09:48,463
Your Grace, if you start
beheading entire families...

101
00:09:48,464 --> 00:09:50,631
I'm not beheading
anyone.

102
00:09:56,005 --> 00:09:57,464
Your Grace.

103
00:10:21,797 --> 00:10:25,338
Lord Randyll Tarly,
Dickon Tarly,

104
00:10:25,339 --> 00:10:28,004
I, Daenerys of House
Targaryen, First of My Name,

105
00:10:28,005 --> 00:10:31,129
Breaker of Chains,
and Mother of Dragons,

106
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:32,963
sentence you to die.

107
00:10:36,547 --> 00:10:37,714
Dracarys.

108
00:11:25,714 --> 00:11:27,255
My... my lord...

109
00:11:37,172 --> 00:11:38,756
How many men
did we lose?

110
00:11:41,339 --> 00:11:43,380
We haven't done
a full accounting.

111
00:11:45,088 --> 00:11:48,546
It's not only armies
that win wars.

112
00:11:48,547 --> 00:11:51,046
We have the Tyrell gold,
we have the Iron Bank behind us.

113
00:11:51,047 --> 00:11:52,714
We can buy
mercenaries.

114
00:11:54,631 --> 00:11:56,504
Not the same as our men,
but they'll fight

115
00:11:56,505 --> 00:11:58,713
if they're well paid,
which they will be.

116
00:11:58,714 --> 00:12:02,171
I just saw
the Dothraki fight.

117
00:12:02,172 --> 00:12:03,796
They'll beat
any mercenary army.

118
00:12:03,797 --> 00:12:05,880
They'll beat any army
I've ever seen.

119
00:12:05,881 --> 00:12:08,755
Killing our men wasn't war
for them, it was sport.

120
00:12:08,756 --> 00:12:10,962
Her dragon burnt
a thousand wagons.

121
00:12:10,963 --> 00:12:13,212
Qyburn's scorpion fired
bolts bigger than you.

122
00:12:13,213 --> 00:12:15,756
They couldn't stop it.
And she has three of them.

123
00:12:17,797 --> 00:12:19,713
This isn't a war
we can win.

124
00:12:19,714 --> 00:12:21,088
So, what do we do?

125
00:12:22,505 --> 00:12:23,756
Sue for peace?

126
00:12:25,088 --> 00:12:26,671
I sit on
her father's throne,

127
00:12:26,672 --> 00:12:29,338
the father you betrayed
and murdered.

128
00:12:29,339 --> 00:12:32,171
And in her mind,
she's winning.

129
00:12:32,172 --> 00:12:34,255
What sort of offer
do you think she'd make?

130
00:12:36,714 --> 00:12:40,129
Maybe we can count on Tyrion
to intercede on our behalf

131
00:12:40,130 --> 00:12:42,505
by way of apology for
murdering our father and son.

132
00:12:44,255 --> 00:12:45,755
He didn't.

133
00:12:45,756 --> 00:12:47,755
You saw the crossbow,
you saw his body.

134
00:12:47,756 --> 00:12:49,630
I'm not talking
about Father.

135
00:12:49,631 --> 00:12:53,171
Tyrion didn't kill Joffrey.
He had nothing to do with it.

136
00:12:53,172 --> 00:12:56,464
- After all this time, it still amazes me that you...
- It was Olenna.

137
00:12:58,839 --> 00:13:01,172
She confessed
before she died.

138
00:13:03,464 --> 00:13:05,713
And this was
before or after

139
00:13:05,714 --> 00:13:08,796
she drank the poison
you so kindly provided her?

140
00:13:08,797 --> 00:13:10,421
After.

141
00:13:10,422 --> 00:13:11,921
And you believed her?

142
00:13:11,922 --> 00:13:14,671
If you were Olenna,
would you rather have seen

143
00:13:14,672 --> 00:13:17,339
your granddaughter married
to Joffrey or Tommen?

144
00:13:19,714 --> 00:13:22,087
Which one would Margaery have
been better able to control?

145
00:13:22,088 --> 00:13:23,630
Which one would have
made Olenna

146
00:13:23,631 --> 00:13:26,338
the true ruler
of the Seven Kingdoms?

147
00:13:26,339 --> 00:13:28,213
She was telling
the truth.

148
00:13:35,589 --> 00:13:37,797
I shouldn't have
listened to you.

149
00:13:39,589 --> 00:13:41,379
She should have
died screaming.

150
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:42,671
She's dead,
like her son,

151
00:13:42,672 --> 00:13:44,755
her grandchildren,
her whole house.

152
00:13:44,756 --> 00:13:48,338
And if we don't find a way out
of this war, we'll follow them.

153
00:13:48,339 --> 00:13:50,880
So we fight and die
or we submit and die.

154
00:13:50,881 --> 00:13:53,046
I know my choice.

155
00:13:53,047 --> 00:13:55,547
A soldier
should know his.

156
00:16:02,672 --> 00:16:04,838
They're beautiful,
aren't they?

157
00:16:04,839 --> 00:16:07,631
It wasn't the word
I was thinking of, but...

158
00:16:08,881 --> 00:16:11,630
but, yes, they are.

159
00:16:11,631 --> 00:16:13,129
Gorgeous beasts.

160
00:16:13,130 --> 00:16:15,046
They're not
beasts to me.

161
00:16:15,047 --> 00:16:16,880
No matter
how big they get

162
00:16:16,881 --> 00:16:19,046
or how terrifying
to everyone else,

163
00:16:19,047 --> 00:16:20,672
they're my children.

164
00:16:26,339 --> 00:16:27,671
You weren't gone long.

165
00:16:27,672 --> 00:16:29,838
No.

166
00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:31,838
And?

167
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:34,547
And I have fewer enemies
today than I did yesterday.

168
00:16:37,213 --> 00:16:39,296
You're not sure
how you feel about that.

169
00:16:39,297 --> 00:16:41,005
No, I'm not.

170
00:16:42,922 --> 00:16:44,379
How many men
did your army kill

171
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:46,380
taking Winterfell back
from the Boltons?

172
00:16:47,547 --> 00:16:48,921
Thousands.

173
00:16:48,922 --> 00:16:51,046
We both want
to help people.

174
00:16:51,047 --> 00:16:54,755
We can only help them
from a position of strength.

175
00:16:54,756 --> 00:16:56,839
Sometimes
strength is terrible.

176
00:17:00,047 --> 00:17:02,713
When you first
came here,

177
00:17:02,714 --> 00:17:06,463
Ser Davos said you took a knife
in the heart for your people.

178
00:17:06,464 --> 00:17:08,088
Ser Davos
gets carried away.

179
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:11,546
So, it was
a figure of speech?

180
00:17:32,088 --> 00:17:33,088
Your Grace.

181
00:17:39,130 --> 00:17:42,504
Jon Snow, this is
Ser Jorah Mormont,

182
00:17:42,505 --> 00:17:44,755
an old friend.

183
00:17:44,756 --> 00:17:46,254
I served
with your father.

184
00:17:46,255 --> 00:17:48,422
He was a great man.

185
00:17:49,963 --> 00:17:51,631
You look strong.

186
00:17:53,464 --> 00:17:54,796
You found a cure?

187
00:17:54,797 --> 00:17:56,755
I wouldn't be here
if I hadn't.

188
00:17:56,756 --> 00:18:01,254
I return to your
service, my queen,

189
00:18:01,255 --> 00:18:03,046
if you'll have me.

190
00:18:03,047 --> 00:18:05,422
It would be my honor.

191
00:19:44,881 --> 00:19:46,338
Ravens.

192
00:19:46,339 --> 00:19:48,172
We need to send ravens.

193
00:19:50,631 --> 00:19:53,379
I put very little stock
in it myself.

194
00:19:53,380 --> 00:19:55,838
Prophecies of doom
are never in short supply,

195
00:19:55,839 --> 00:19:58,046
especially
when winter comes.

196
00:19:58,047 --> 00:20:00,379
I remember Wolkan.

197
00:20:00,380 --> 00:20:02,755
A little timid,
but a sharp mind.

198
00:20:02,756 --> 00:20:06,254
Eh, the North has dulled
many good maesters' wits.

199
00:20:06,255 --> 00:20:08,463
Hard to say whether
it's the cold, the drink,

200
00:20:08,464 --> 00:20:10,254
or the company.

201
00:20:10,255 --> 00:20:12,421
A crippled boy
claims to have seen

202
00:20:12,422 --> 00:20:14,546
dead men on the march
beyond the Wall,

203
00:20:14,547 --> 00:20:17,713
thanks to the magical help
of a raven with three eyes?

204
00:20:17,714 --> 00:20:19,379
Yes, it is a bit much.

205
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:22,088
- Still, we ought to write back...
- Brandon Stark.

206
00:20:25,589 --> 00:20:28,756
- The crippled boy.
- Do you know him?

207
00:20:29,922 --> 00:20:32,087
I led him through
the Wall years ago.

208
00:20:32,088 --> 00:20:35,254
I saw him go
beyond the Wall.

209
00:20:35,255 --> 00:20:36,838
And?

210
00:20:36,839 --> 00:20:39,755
Somehow,
a crippled boy

211
00:20:39,756 --> 00:20:41,838
survived for years beyond the
Wall when no one else could.

212
00:20:41,839 --> 00:20:45,589
Not the Night's Watch,
not the wildlings, no one.

213
00:20:47,213 --> 00:20:49,296
Perhaps we ought to listen
to what he has to say.

214
00:20:49,297 --> 00:20:52,421
Perhaps you need more scribing
work to discipline your mind.

215
00:20:52,422 --> 00:20:55,839
I sense a more detailed
proposal is forthcoming?

216
00:21:06,464 --> 00:21:10,463
Everyone in Westeros
trusts and respects you.

217
00:21:10,464 --> 00:21:14,630
If you tell people the threat
is real, they'll believe it.

218
00:21:14,631 --> 00:21:17,004
If you advise all the lords
to send their men north

219
00:21:17,005 --> 00:21:18,962
to hold the Wall,
they'll do it.

220
00:21:18,963 --> 00:21:22,463
And if you tell every
maester in the Citadel

221
00:21:22,464 --> 00:21:24,796
to search every word
of every faded scroll

222
00:21:24,797 --> 00:21:26,588
about the Long Night,

223
00:21:26,589 --> 00:21:28,421
they may find something
that lets us defeat

224
00:21:28,422 --> 00:21:30,339
the Army of the Dead
for good.

225
00:21:35,422 --> 00:21:36,631
It could be done.

226
00:21:38,047 --> 00:21:40,838
And this news
could be authentic.

227
00:21:40,839 --> 00:21:42,505
It's possible.

228
00:21:45,005 --> 00:21:47,338
It's also possible
that this message

229
00:21:47,339 --> 00:21:49,630
is part of a ploy
by the Dragon Queen

230
00:21:49,631 --> 00:21:52,588
to lure southern armies away from the
lands they are currently defending

231
00:21:52,589 --> 00:21:54,630
to open those lands
to easy conquest.

232
00:21:54,631 --> 00:21:56,338
That does
seem far more likely

233
00:21:56,339 --> 00:21:58,296
than magic birds
talking to cripples.

234
00:21:58,297 --> 00:22:00,838
Archmaester, please.

235
00:22:00,839 --> 00:22:02,005
It's real.

236
00:22:03,922 --> 00:22:05,005
I've seen it.

237
00:22:07,839 --> 00:22:09,338
We will write
to Maester Wolkan

238
00:22:09,339 --> 00:22:11,713
at Winterfell
for clarification.

239
00:22:11,714 --> 00:22:14,588
I promise you we will get to the
truth of it one way or another.

240
00:22:14,589 --> 00:22:17,296
- Archmaester, please...
- That will be all, Tarly.

241
00:22:17,297 --> 00:22:19,796
It brings to mind the
work of Jenny of Oldstones,

242
00:22:19,797 --> 00:22:22,421
the charlatan who claimed descent
from the children of the forest.

243
00:22:22,422 --> 00:22:25,212
Don't forget the prophet Lodos,

244
00:22:25,213 --> 00:22:28,880
who promised that the Drowned God would
rise up and destroy Aegon the Conqueror.

245
00:22:28,881 --> 00:22:31,172
Ah, Lodos.

246
00:22:34,464 --> 00:22:39,004
Is he the one whose father and
brother were just burnt alive?

247
00:22:39,005 --> 00:22:40,962
I'm afraid so.

248
00:22:40,963 --> 00:22:42,212
Horrible business.

249
00:22:42,213 --> 00:22:44,838
I haven't had the heart
to tell him yet.

250
00:22:44,839 --> 00:22:46,880
He's a good lad.

251
00:22:46,881 --> 00:22:48,630
Right.

252
00:22:48,631 --> 00:22:51,546
The ravenry was falling apart
the last time I checked.

253
00:22:56,756 --> 00:22:59,379
All rulers demand
that people bend the knee.

254
00:22:59,380 --> 00:23:00,589
That's why
they're rulers.

255
00:23:03,714 --> 00:23:05,713
She gave Tarly
a choice,

256
00:23:05,714 --> 00:23:08,546
a man who had taken up
arms against her.

257
00:23:08,547 --> 00:23:10,296
What else
could she do?

258
00:23:10,297 --> 00:23:13,421
Not burn him alive
alongside his son?

259
00:23:13,422 --> 00:23:15,755
I am her Hand, not her head.

260
00:23:15,756 --> 00:23:18,004
I can't make
her decisions for her.

261
00:23:18,005 --> 00:23:21,296
That's what I used to tell
myself about her father.

262
00:23:21,297 --> 00:23:25,671
I found the traitors, but I wasn't
the one burning them alive.

263
00:23:25,672 --> 00:23:28,422
I was only a purveyor
of information.

264
00:23:33,589 --> 00:23:37,630
It's what I told myself when I
watched them beg for mercy...

265
00:23:37,631 --> 00:23:40,212
I'm not the one
doing it.

266
00:23:40,213 --> 00:23:42,671
When the pitch of their
screams rose higher...

267
00:23:42,672 --> 00:23:44,713
I'm not the one
doing it.

268
00:23:44,714 --> 00:23:46,296
When their hair
caught fire

269
00:23:46,297 --> 00:23:49,171
and the smell of their burning
flesh filled the throne room...

270
00:23:49,172 --> 00:23:50,797
I'm not the one
doing it.

271
00:23:59,464 --> 00:24:01,671
Daenerys is not
her father.

272
00:24:01,672 --> 00:24:04,087
And she never will be

273
00:24:04,088 --> 00:24:06,130
with the right counsel.

274
00:24:09,380 --> 00:24:11,797
You need to find a way
to make her listen.

275
00:24:14,255 --> 00:24:17,630
- Who's that for?
- Jon Snow.

276
00:24:17,631 --> 00:24:19,171
Did you read it?

277
00:24:19,172 --> 00:24:22,213
It's a sealed scroll
for the King in the North.

278
00:24:28,339 --> 00:24:29,797
What's it say?

279
00:24:30,881 --> 00:24:32,464
Nothing good.

280
00:24:38,963 --> 00:24:42,338
I thought
Arya was dead.

281
00:24:42,339 --> 00:24:45,421
I thought Bran
was dead.

282
00:24:45,422 --> 00:24:46,839
I'm happy for you.

283
00:24:49,213 --> 00:24:50,630
You don't look happy.

284
00:24:50,631 --> 00:24:53,004
Bran saw the Night King
and his army

285
00:24:53,005 --> 00:24:55,005
marching towards
Eastwatch.

286
00:24:56,589 --> 00:24:58,588
If they make it
past the Wall...

287
00:24:58,589 --> 00:25:01,296
The Wall has kept them out for
thousands of years, presumably.

288
00:25:01,297 --> 00:25:02,962
I need to go home.

289
00:25:02,963 --> 00:25:04,671
You said you don't
have enough men.

290
00:25:04,672 --> 00:25:07,254
We'll fight
with the men we have.

291
00:25:07,255 --> 00:25:08,880
Unless you'll join us.

292
00:25:08,881 --> 00:25:11,046
And give the country
to Cersei?

293
00:25:11,047 --> 00:25:14,880
As soon as I march away,
she marches in.

294
00:25:14,881 --> 00:25:17,212
Perhaps not.

295
00:25:17,213 --> 00:25:20,630
Cersei thinks the Army of the
Dead is nothing but a story

296
00:25:20,631 --> 00:25:23,880
made up by wet nurses
to frighten children.

297
00:25:23,881 --> 00:25:25,630
What if we
prove her wrong?

298
00:25:25,631 --> 00:25:29,047
I don't think she'll come see
the dead at my invitation.

299
00:25:30,339 --> 00:25:32,380
So bring
the dead to her.

300
00:25:33,839 --> 00:25:35,713
I thought that was what
we were trying to avoid.

301
00:25:35,714 --> 00:25:38,087
We don't have to
bring the whole army.

302
00:25:38,088 --> 00:25:40,129
Only one soldier.

303
00:25:40,130 --> 00:25:42,047
Is that possible?

304
00:25:45,881 --> 00:25:47,588
The first wight
I ever saw

305
00:25:47,589 --> 00:25:50,421
was brought into Castle
Black from beyond the Wall.

306
00:25:50,422 --> 00:25:52,755
Bring one of these things
down to King's Landing

307
00:25:52,756 --> 00:25:55,046
and show her the truth.

308
00:25:55,047 --> 00:25:57,087
Anything you bring back
will be useless

309
00:25:57,088 --> 00:25:58,921
unless Cersei
grants us an audience

310
00:25:58,922 --> 00:26:01,463
and is somehow convinced
not to murder us

311
00:26:01,464 --> 00:26:03,713
the moment we set foot
in the capital.

312
00:26:03,714 --> 00:26:07,296
The only person
she listens to is Jaime.

313
00:26:07,297 --> 00:26:09,130
He might listen to me.

314
00:26:13,130 --> 00:26:14,963
And how would you get
into King's Landing?

315
00:26:21,130 --> 00:26:22,962
I can smuggle you in,

316
00:26:22,963 --> 00:26:25,588
but if the gold cloaks
were to recognize you,

317
00:26:25,589 --> 00:26:28,796
I'm warning you,
I'm not a fighter.

318
00:26:28,797 --> 00:26:30,212
Well, it will all
be for nothing

319
00:26:30,213 --> 00:26:32,004
if we don't have
one of these dead men.

320
00:26:32,005 --> 00:26:33,379
Fair point.

321
00:26:33,380 --> 00:26:34,672
How do you propose
to find one?

322
00:26:38,088 --> 00:26:41,297
With the queen's permission,
I'll go north and take one.

323
00:26:43,005 --> 00:26:46,338
You asked me to find a
cure so I could serve you.

324
00:26:46,339 --> 00:26:47,963
Allow me
to serve you.

325
00:26:51,963 --> 00:26:53,463
The Free Folk
will help us.

326
00:26:53,464 --> 00:26:56,212
They know the real north
better than anyone.

327
00:26:56,213 --> 00:26:57,755
They won't follow
Ser Jorah.

328
00:26:57,756 --> 00:26:58,963
They won't have to.

329
00:27:06,005 --> 00:27:08,421
You can't lead a raid
beyond the Wall.

330
00:27:08,422 --> 00:27:11,046
You're not in the Night's Watch
anymore, you're King in the North.

331
00:27:11,047 --> 00:27:13,630
I'm the only one here
who's fought them.

332
00:27:13,631 --> 00:27:16,005
I'm the only one here
who knows them.

333
00:27:17,380 --> 00:27:19,380
I haven't given you
permission to leave.

334
00:27:22,213 --> 00:27:25,588
With respect, Your Grace,
I don't need your permission.

335
00:27:25,589 --> 00:27:26,797
I am a king.

336
00:27:28,422 --> 00:27:29,838
And I came here

337
00:27:29,839 --> 00:27:31,671
knowing that you could
have your men behead me

338
00:27:31,672 --> 00:27:34,880
or your dragons
burn me alive.

339
00:27:34,881 --> 00:27:39,296
I put my trust
in you, a stranger,

340
00:27:39,297 --> 00:27:42,296
because I knew it was the
best chance for my people,

341
00:27:42,297 --> 00:27:44,464
for all our people.

342
00:27:46,005 --> 00:27:50,339
Now I'm asking you
to trust in a stranger...

343
00:27:52,047 --> 00:27:54,547
because it's
our best chance.

344
00:28:12,547 --> 00:28:16,881
The King in the North
should stay in the North.

345
00:28:19,422 --> 00:28:23,796
We did not choose you
to rule us, my lady.

346
00:28:23,797 --> 00:28:26,631
But perhaps we should have.

347
00:28:29,130 --> 00:28:33,921
The Knights of the Vale came
here for you, Lady Stark.

348
00:28:33,922 --> 00:28:35,380
Aye.

349
00:28:39,839 --> 00:28:43,254
You are very kind,
my lords.

350
00:28:43,255 --> 00:28:45,296
But Jon is our king.

351
00:28:45,297 --> 00:28:47,838
He is doing what
he thinks is best.

352
00:28:57,756 --> 00:28:59,796
I warned Jon
this would happen.

353
00:28:59,797 --> 00:29:01,463
That he couldn't
leave the North

354
00:29:01,464 --> 00:29:04,296
and expect it to just sit
and wait for him like Ghost.

355
00:29:04,297 --> 00:29:06,671
He didn't. He trusted
you to hold it for him.

356
00:29:06,672 --> 00:29:09,464
Well, he's not making it easy.
The Northern lords are proud.

357
00:29:14,130 --> 00:29:16,421
These are Mother
and Father's chambers.

358
00:29:16,422 --> 00:29:17,963
And?

359
00:29:20,672 --> 00:29:23,004
Nothing.

360
00:29:23,005 --> 00:29:25,796
Don't do that.

361
00:29:25,797 --> 00:29:28,297
- What?
- Say what you mean.

362
00:29:29,963 --> 00:29:32,422
You always liked
nice things.

363
00:29:33,797 --> 00:29:36,130
They made you feel
better than everyone.

364
00:29:41,047 --> 00:29:42,630
Are you angry with me?

365
00:29:42,631 --> 00:29:44,962
They were insulting Jon,

366
00:29:44,963 --> 00:29:46,338
and you sat there
and listened.

367
00:29:46,339 --> 00:29:47,838
I listened
to their complaints,

368
00:29:47,839 --> 00:29:50,880
which is my responsibility
as Lady of Winterfell.

369
00:29:50,881 --> 00:29:53,838
Their opinions
are important to you.

370
00:29:53,839 --> 00:29:56,546
Glover has 500 men,
Royce has 2,000.

371
00:29:56,547 --> 00:29:59,504
Offend them
and Jon loses his army.

372
00:29:59,505 --> 00:30:01,505
Not if they lose
their heads first.

373
00:30:04,963 --> 00:30:08,129
Winterfell didn't just
fall into our hands.

374
00:30:08,130 --> 00:30:10,004
We took it back,

375
00:30:10,005 --> 00:30:11,962
and the Mormonts
and the Hornwoods

376
00:30:11,963 --> 00:30:13,421
and the wildlings
and the Vale.

377
00:30:13,422 --> 00:30:14,962
All of us,
working together.

378
00:30:14,963 --> 00:30:19,296
Now, I'm sure cutting off
heads is very satisfying,

379
00:30:19,297 --> 00:30:22,839
but that's not the way you
get people to work together.

380
00:30:26,005 --> 00:30:28,296
And if Jon
doesn't come back,

381
00:30:28,297 --> 00:30:30,254
you'll need
their support...

382
00:30:30,255 --> 00:30:32,379
so you can
work together

383
00:30:32,380 --> 00:30:34,338
to give you
what you really want.

384
00:30:34,339 --> 00:30:36,922
How can you even think
such a horrible thing?

385
00:30:39,631 --> 00:30:41,672
You're thinking it
right now.

386
00:30:43,672 --> 00:30:46,630
You don't want to be,

387
00:30:46,631 --> 00:30:48,922
but the thought
just won't go away.

388
00:30:54,839 --> 00:30:56,714
I have work to do.

389
00:31:00,380 --> 00:31:01,672
My lady.

390
00:31:13,714 --> 00:31:16,962
Last time I was here, I killed
my father with a crossbow.

391
00:31:16,963 --> 00:31:19,922
Last time I was here, you
killed my son with wildfire.

392
00:31:23,088 --> 00:31:25,921
There's a path to the left
that hugs the cliff.

393
00:31:25,922 --> 00:31:28,588
The guards
hardly ever patrol it.

394
00:31:28,589 --> 00:31:29,963
Too many steps.

395
00:31:34,839 --> 00:31:36,129
You're not
staying here?

396
00:31:36,130 --> 00:31:39,630
I've got my own business
in Flea Bottom.

397
00:31:39,631 --> 00:31:41,463
What if someone
takes the boat?

398
00:31:41,464 --> 00:31:43,756
Then we're fucked.
Best hurry.

399
00:31:49,172 --> 00:31:50,588
We don't have time
for this.

400
00:31:50,589 --> 00:31:52,755
We should be preparing
the city for a siege.

401
00:31:52,756 --> 00:31:53,921
The Dothraki
are coming.

402
00:31:53,922 --> 00:31:56,046
All the more reason
for you to train.

403
00:31:56,047 --> 00:31:58,046
Unless you plan on fighting
Dothraki 12-year-olds.

404
00:31:58,047 --> 00:32:00,588
Well, I seem to recall them giving
you a bit of trouble as well.

405
00:32:00,589 --> 00:32:02,588
And here I am,
ready to train.

406
00:32:02,589 --> 00:32:04,546
Why down here?

407
00:32:04,547 --> 00:32:06,379
I don't think
you want people to see

408
00:32:06,380 --> 00:32:09,296
how you look swinging
that thing yet.

409
00:32:09,297 --> 00:32:12,087
Today might be the day
I kill you by accident.

410
00:32:12,088 --> 00:32:14,631
Oh, you won't be
swinging it at me.

411
00:32:22,839 --> 00:32:24,505
I'll leave you
to it.

412
00:32:28,297 --> 00:32:29,631
I needed to see you.

413
00:32:31,088 --> 00:32:32,922
And I knew you'd
never agree to meet.

414
00:32:36,464 --> 00:32:39,421
You made me look
like a complete fool.

415
00:32:39,422 --> 00:32:41,713
I thought I'd surprise you
by hitting Casterly Rock,

416
00:32:41,714 --> 00:32:44,671
but you were
three steps ahead of me.

417
00:32:44,672 --> 00:32:47,254
Abandoned the family home,
completely unsentimental.

418
00:32:47,255 --> 00:32:48,755
Father would have
been proud.

419
00:32:48,756 --> 00:32:50,504
- Don't talk about Father.
- Listen to me...

420
00:32:50,505 --> 00:32:52,004
I once told Bronn

421
00:32:52,005 --> 00:32:54,839
that if I ever saw you
again, I'd cut you in half.

422
00:32:57,839 --> 00:33:00,339
It'll take you a while
with a sparring sword.

423
00:33:09,505 --> 00:33:11,421
He was going to execute me.

424
00:33:11,422 --> 00:33:14,129
He knew
I was innocent.

425
00:33:14,130 --> 00:33:16,463
He didn't hate me
because of anything I did,

426
00:33:16,464 --> 00:33:18,838
he hated me
because of what I am.

427
00:33:18,839 --> 00:33:22,005
A little monster
sent to punish him.

428
00:33:23,881 --> 00:33:26,087
Did he...
did he think...

429
00:33:26,088 --> 00:33:27,880
did he think I wanted
to be born this way?

430
00:33:27,881 --> 00:33:29,801
- Did he think I chose it...
- What do you want?!

431
00:33:36,297 --> 00:33:37,839
Daenerys will
win this war.

432
00:33:40,213 --> 00:33:41,630
You're
a military man.

433
00:33:41,631 --> 00:33:44,380
You must know there's
no way around that.

434
00:33:46,422 --> 00:33:48,004
Daenerys
is not her father.

435
00:33:48,005 --> 00:33:50,880
She's even willing
to suspend the hostilities

436
00:33:50,881 --> 00:33:53,380
if Cersei agrees
to certain terms.

437
00:33:54,547 --> 00:33:55,921
If you want Cersei
to bend the knee,

438
00:33:55,922 --> 00:33:57,379
you can ask her
yourself.

439
00:33:57,380 --> 00:33:59,756
I... I don't.
And Daenerys doesn't.

440
00:34:01,172 --> 00:34:02,881
Not right now,
anyway.

441
00:34:05,047 --> 00:34:07,297
She has a more
important request.

442
00:34:46,797 --> 00:34:49,005
I wasn't sure
I'd find you.

443
00:34:56,297 --> 00:34:58,296
Thought you might
still be rowing.

444
00:35:01,922 --> 00:35:05,004
I looked in shops,
taverns, brothels.

445
00:35:05,005 --> 00:35:08,296
Should have known to come
straight to the Street of Steel.

446
00:35:08,297 --> 00:35:10,796
Aren't you worried
about the gold cloaks?

447
00:35:10,797 --> 00:35:12,212
Haven't been here
in years.

448
00:35:12,213 --> 00:35:14,630
Why should
they recognize me?

449
00:35:14,631 --> 00:35:17,297
Sometimes I hardly do.

450
00:35:18,963 --> 00:35:21,130
Nothing fucks you
harder than time.

451
00:35:25,922 --> 00:35:28,004
Anybody give you
any trouble?

452
00:35:28,005 --> 00:35:30,463
Here I am,
arming Lannisters,

453
00:35:30,464 --> 00:35:32,338
and I never get
a second look.

454
00:35:32,339 --> 00:35:33,838
But you were right.

455
00:35:33,839 --> 00:35:36,379
Safest place for me was
right under the queen's nose.

456
00:35:36,380 --> 00:35:37,880
Don't be so sure.

457
00:35:37,881 --> 00:35:40,797
Safety is never a permanent
state of affairs.

458
00:35:43,005 --> 00:35:44,547
Bad things are coming.

459
00:35:47,047 --> 00:35:50,004
You came to get me.
You want me to come with you.

460
00:35:50,005 --> 00:35:52,129
- Well, the thing you need to understand is...
- I'm ready.

461
00:35:52,130 --> 00:35:53,588
- You...
- Let's go.

462
00:35:53,589 --> 00:35:55,504
You should know
what you're heading into.

463
00:35:55,505 --> 00:35:57,504
What do you think
I've been thinking about

464
00:35:57,505 --> 00:35:58,880
with every swing
of the hammer?

465
00:35:58,881 --> 00:36:01,338
How happy I am
making weapons

466
00:36:01,339 --> 00:36:03,796
for the family
that killed my father?

467
00:36:03,797 --> 00:36:05,504
The family that
tried to kill me?

468
00:36:07,631 --> 00:36:09,880
I've been getting ready.

469
00:36:09,881 --> 00:36:11,338
I never knew what for,

470
00:36:11,339 --> 00:36:13,881
but I've always known
I'd know it when it comes.

471
00:36:15,547 --> 00:36:18,630
You might want to bring
one of those swords.

472
00:36:18,631 --> 00:36:20,547
I don't know much
about swinging swords.

473
00:36:22,047 --> 00:36:23,380
But this...

474
00:36:25,213 --> 00:36:26,547
this I know.

475
00:36:35,631 --> 00:36:37,046
Keep your father's name
to yourself.

476
00:36:37,047 --> 00:36:39,839
Situation's complicated
enough already.

477
00:36:41,213 --> 00:36:42,881
Well, who should
I say I am?

478
00:36:46,714 --> 00:36:49,129
I told you, Clovis, if we
don't get out of here soon,

479
00:36:49,130 --> 00:36:51,010
- someone's going to...
- You there!

480
00:36:53,255 --> 00:36:55,589
No weapons, friends.
I promise.

481
00:36:56,797 --> 00:36:58,254
What can I do
for you?

482
00:36:58,255 --> 00:37:00,755
- Is that your boat?
- It is.

483
00:37:00,756 --> 00:37:03,171
- The docks are that way.
- That they are.

484
00:37:03,172 --> 00:37:04,671
I try to stay
away from them

485
00:37:04,672 --> 00:37:06,922
to avoid good men
such as yourselves.

486
00:37:09,547 --> 00:37:12,921
- Still five gold dragons?
- Are you joking?

487
00:37:12,922 --> 00:37:15,171
You must be even older
than you look.

488
00:37:15,172 --> 00:37:17,087
- 15.
- 15?!

489
00:37:17,088 --> 00:37:18,213
Apiece.

490
00:37:26,631 --> 00:37:28,756
I can't say it was a pleasure
doing business with you.

491
00:37:31,255 --> 00:37:32,631
What's in the boat?

492
00:37:38,172 --> 00:37:39,338
Not more gold.

493
00:37:39,339 --> 00:37:41,087
- Wine?
- Mm.

494
00:37:41,088 --> 00:37:43,088
- I like wine.
- Or hams.

495
00:37:45,005 --> 00:37:46,130
Come have a look.

496
00:37:54,672 --> 00:37:56,588
- Fermented crab.
- What?

497
00:37:56,589 --> 00:37:58,463
Fermented crab.

498
00:37:58,464 --> 00:38:01,463
One bucket of this triples a
brothel's earnings for the week.

499
00:38:01,464 --> 00:38:03,421
A man thinks he's done.

500
00:38:03,422 --> 00:38:06,004
He's ready to go back
to his loving family.

501
00:38:06,005 --> 00:38:07,921
But before he gets
his breeches up,

502
00:38:07,922 --> 00:38:11,296
his lady of the hour pops a tiny
spoon of that into his mouth.

503
00:38:11,297 --> 00:38:14,838
Five minutes later,
he's back in the race.

504
00:38:14,839 --> 00:38:17,339
Here, have a taste.

505
00:38:30,005 --> 00:38:31,880
I'd hurry to your
favorite establishment,

506
00:38:31,881 --> 00:38:34,379
or you'll put a hole
in that chainmail.

507
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:03,380
Oi, dwarf!

508
00:39:04,714 --> 00:39:06,254
I really wouldn't
try any more

509
00:39:06,255 --> 00:39:08,296
until you see how
the first bite hits you.

510
00:39:08,297 --> 00:39:10,171
That dwarf...

511
00:39:10,172 --> 00:39:11,796
Where'd you get
that scar?

512
00:39:11,797 --> 00:39:14,338
Fish hook. Some men
you just can't teach.

513
00:39:14,339 --> 00:39:17,421
We was looking for a dwarf with
a scar like that a while back.

514
00:39:17,422 --> 00:39:19,463
Perhaps there's
some arrangement?

515
00:39:21,881 --> 00:39:23,838
Arrangement?

516
00:39:23,839 --> 00:39:27,046
You gonna arrange to pay us
more than Queen Cersei...

517
00:39:34,881 --> 00:39:36,588
This is Gendry.

518
00:39:36,589 --> 00:39:38,088
He'll do.

519
00:39:40,797 --> 00:39:41,797
Go, go, go.

520
00:39:44,589 --> 00:39:46,087
I could give you something.

521
00:39:46,088 --> 00:39:47,589
That won't
be necessary.

522
00:39:56,255 --> 00:39:57,255
Ser Jaime.

523
00:40:00,088 --> 00:40:02,756
Why was Qyburn here?

524
00:40:04,172 --> 00:40:06,422
He's the Hand of the Queen.
Why are you here?

525
00:40:11,088 --> 00:40:13,631
I met with Tyrion.

526
00:40:21,505 --> 00:40:24,255
What did our brother
have to say?

527
00:40:26,839 --> 00:40:29,296
Daenerys
wants to meet.

528
00:40:29,297 --> 00:40:31,921
To discuss
her surrender?

529
00:40:31,922 --> 00:40:33,755
To discuss
an armistice.

530
00:40:33,756 --> 00:40:36,546
She's just won a great victory.
Why would she want a truce now?

531
00:40:36,547 --> 00:40:38,296
Because an army
of dead men

532
00:40:38,297 --> 00:40:40,839
is marching
on the Seven Kingdoms.

533
00:40:43,339 --> 00:40:45,171
Tyrion claims
he'll have proof.

534
00:40:49,047 --> 00:40:51,421
- Are you going to punish him?
- Tyrion?

535
00:40:51,422 --> 00:40:52,922
Bronn.

536
00:40:55,464 --> 00:40:57,838
He betrayed you.

537
00:40:57,839 --> 00:41:00,213
He set up a meeting without
your knowledge or consent.

538
00:41:04,047 --> 00:41:05,338
Do you think
anything of importance

539
00:41:05,339 --> 00:41:07,838
happens in this city
without me knowing?

540
00:41:07,839 --> 00:41:11,087
You let it happen.
Why?

541
00:41:11,088 --> 00:41:13,755
I've come
to believe that

542
00:41:13,756 --> 00:41:16,463
an accommodation
with the Dragon Queen

543
00:41:16,464 --> 00:41:19,004
could be in our
immediate interest.

544
00:41:19,005 --> 00:41:22,338
She has the numbers. If we want to
beat her, we have to be clever.

545
00:41:22,339 --> 00:41:24,505
We have to fight her
like Father would have.

546
00:41:27,963 --> 00:41:31,130
Dead men, dragons,
and Dragon Queens...

547
00:41:33,172 --> 00:41:36,171
Whatever stands
in our way,

548
00:41:36,172 --> 00:41:37,921
we will defeat it.

549
00:41:37,922 --> 00:41:40,713
For ourselves,
for our house,

550
00:41:40,714 --> 00:41:42,714
for this.

551
00:41:55,339 --> 00:41:56,921
Who will you say
is the father?

552
00:41:56,922 --> 00:41:58,213
You.

553
00:42:04,130 --> 00:42:05,380
People won't like that.

554
00:42:09,005 --> 00:42:13,421
Do you remember what Father
used to say about people?

555
00:42:13,422 --> 00:42:17,380
The lion does not concern himself
with the opinions of the sheep.

556
00:42:31,297 --> 00:42:33,255
Never betray me again.

557
00:42:38,339 --> 00:42:40,254
We're leaving today.

558
00:42:40,255 --> 00:42:43,838
- The king's got a lot on his mind.
- I understand.

559
00:42:43,839 --> 00:42:46,421
He doesn't need to be thinking about
harboring the bastard of a dead king.

560
00:42:46,422 --> 00:42:48,880
- You don't have to worry.
- You're just Clovis,

561
00:42:48,881 --> 00:42:51,212
a smith who's come
to pay his respects

562
00:42:51,213 --> 00:42:54,212
before he heads off to work
at the Winterfell forges.

563
00:42:54,213 --> 00:42:56,212
Understood.

564
00:42:57,672 --> 00:42:59,838
Begging your pardon,
Your Grace.

565
00:42:59,839 --> 00:43:01,296
You survived King's Landing.

566
00:43:01,297 --> 00:43:04,296
Yet again.
Your Grace, this is Clo...

567
00:43:04,297 --> 00:43:06,713
Name's Gendry,
Your Grace.

568
00:43:06,714 --> 00:43:08,296
I'm Robert Baratheon's son.

569
00:43:08,297 --> 00:43:09,422
Bastard son.

570
00:43:12,505 --> 00:43:14,962
He was meant
to keep that to himself.

571
00:43:14,963 --> 00:43:16,796
Our fathers
trusted each other.

572
00:43:16,797 --> 00:43:18,130
Why shouldn't we?

573
00:43:20,422 --> 00:43:22,921
I saw your father once
at Winterfell.

574
00:43:22,922 --> 00:43:26,130
I met yours
in my shop.

575
00:43:27,839 --> 00:43:30,172
- You're a lot leaner.
- And you're a lot shorter.

576
00:43:40,255 --> 00:43:44,046
I grew up on
stories about them.

577
00:43:44,047 --> 00:43:47,047
All I ever knew is that
they fought together and won.

578
00:43:48,797 --> 00:43:51,588
Ser Davos told me where you're
going, Your Grace, and why.

579
00:43:51,589 --> 00:43:53,379
Let me come
with you.

580
00:43:53,380 --> 00:43:55,254
Don't be a fool.
You're not a soldier.

581
00:43:55,255 --> 00:43:57,087
No,
but I'm a fighter.

582
00:43:57,088 --> 00:44:00,172
And he won't be needing a
smith with a sword like that.

583
00:44:02,589 --> 00:44:04,087
You know
how to use one?

584
00:44:04,088 --> 00:44:06,463
Well,
that's a problem.

585
00:44:06,464 --> 00:44:08,005
I prefer a hammer.

586
00:44:11,005 --> 00:44:12,714
He can handle himself.

587
00:44:14,505 --> 00:44:16,588
We could use the help.

588
00:44:16,589 --> 00:44:18,463
As my father
used to say,

589
00:44:18,464 --> 00:44:20,546
"It's better to be
a coward for a minute,

590
00:44:20,547 --> 00:44:22,796
than dead for
the rest of your life."

591
00:44:22,797 --> 00:44:25,212
I owe you my life.

592
00:44:25,213 --> 00:44:27,004
Twice over.

593
00:44:27,005 --> 00:44:30,254
But if what you said is true
about what's up there,

594
00:44:30,255 --> 00:44:32,714
I can't wait out
this war.

595
00:44:36,505 --> 00:44:38,421
Yeah, nobody mind me.

596
00:44:38,422 --> 00:44:42,463
All I've ever done
is live to a ripe old age.

597
00:44:42,464 --> 00:44:44,379
All right, come on.

598
00:44:53,963 --> 00:44:56,212
You may not believe it,

599
00:44:56,213 --> 00:44:58,921
but I've missed you,
Mormont.

600
00:44:58,922 --> 00:45:02,046
Nobody glowers
quite like you.

601
00:45:02,047 --> 00:45:03,339
Not even Grey Worm.

602
00:45:09,130 --> 00:45:11,087
This is the coin
the slaver gave me

603
00:45:11,088 --> 00:45:14,087
when I suggested he free us
and pay us, remember?

604
00:45:14,088 --> 00:45:17,922
It was supposed to last us
the rest of our lives.

605
00:45:22,380 --> 00:45:23,756
Take it with you.

606
00:45:26,422 --> 00:45:27,921
But bring it back.

607
00:45:27,922 --> 00:45:29,088
Our queen needs you.

608
00:45:38,464 --> 00:45:40,922
We should be better
at saying farewell by now.

609
00:45:42,589 --> 00:45:44,088
Your Grace, I...

610
00:46:01,505 --> 00:46:03,755
If I don't return, at least
you won't have to deal

611
00:46:03,756 --> 00:46:05,116
with the King
in the North anymore.

612
00:46:07,422 --> 00:46:09,297
I've grown used to him.

613
00:46:11,380 --> 00:46:14,005
I wish you good fortune in the
wars to come, Your Grace.

614
00:46:23,088 --> 00:46:24,756
Heave!

615
00:46:47,881 --> 00:46:52,338
Do you know how many
steps there are in the Citadel?

616
00:46:52,339 --> 00:46:53,546
No.

617
00:46:53,547 --> 00:46:56,505
15,782.

618
00:47:01,088 --> 00:47:04,505
Guess how many windows are
in the Great Sept of Baelor.

619
00:47:06,631 --> 00:47:09,171
None anymore.

620
00:47:09,172 --> 00:47:10,838
That's true.

621
00:47:10,839 --> 00:47:15,171
This High Septon Maynard,
he recorded everything.

622
00:47:15,172 --> 00:47:17,380
He even recorded
his own bowel movements.

623
00:47:20,922 --> 00:47:24,129
What does
"annulment" mean?

624
00:47:24,130 --> 00:47:28,004
It's when a man
sets aside his lawful wife.

625
00:47:28,005 --> 00:47:33,379
Maynard says here that he issued
an annulment for a Prince "Ragger"

626
00:47:33,380 --> 00:47:36,880
and remarried him to someone
else at the same time

627
00:47:36,881 --> 00:47:39,421
in a secret ceremony
in Dorne.

628
00:47:39,422 --> 00:47:41,338
Is that a common thing
in the south or...?

629
00:47:41,339 --> 00:47:42,714
These maesters...

630
00:47:44,589 --> 00:47:48,171
they set me to the task of preserving
that man's window counting

631
00:47:48,172 --> 00:47:50,463
and annulments and bowel
movements for all eternity,

632
00:47:50,464 --> 00:47:52,254
while the secret to
defeating the Night King's

633
00:47:52,255 --> 00:47:54,921
probably sitting on some dusty shelf
somewhere, completely ignored.

634
00:47:54,922 --> 00:47:56,838
But that's all right,
isn't it?

635
00:47:56,839 --> 00:48:00,921
We can all become slavering, murderous
imbeciles in thrall to evil incarnate

636
00:48:00,922 --> 00:48:02,546
as long as we can have access
to the full records

637
00:48:02,547 --> 00:48:06,589
of High Septon Maynard's
15,782 shits!

638
00:48:08,922 --> 00:48:10,547
Steps.

639
00:48:13,589 --> 00:48:15,714
That number
was the steps.

640
00:49:37,672 --> 00:49:40,254
Are you sure
you want to do this?

641
00:49:40,255 --> 00:49:42,672
You always wanted
to be a maester.

642
00:49:44,297 --> 00:49:48,464
I'm tired of reading about
the achievements of better men.

643
00:51:17,547 --> 00:51:19,422
I found it, my lord.

644
00:51:23,130 --> 00:51:24,838
It, uh, took
some searching.

645
00:51:24,839 --> 00:51:26,922
Maester Luwin's archives
are very thorough.

646
00:51:31,631 --> 00:51:34,254
You're sure this is the
only copy in Winterfell?

647
00:51:34,255 --> 00:51:36,130
Uh, yes, my lord.

648
00:51:40,922 --> 00:51:42,839
Lady Stark thanks you
for your service.

649
00:54:14,963 --> 00:54:16,838
Isn't it your
job to talk him out

650
00:54:16,839 --> 00:54:18,838
of stupid fucking
ideas like this?

651
00:54:18,839 --> 00:54:21,631
I've been failing
at that job of late.

652
00:54:23,255 --> 00:54:25,296
How many queens
are there now?

653
00:54:25,297 --> 00:54:26,630
Two.

654
00:54:26,631 --> 00:54:29,796
And you need to convince
the one with the dragons

655
00:54:29,797 --> 00:54:31,630
or the one who
fucks her brother?

656
00:54:33,464 --> 00:54:34,464
Both.

657
00:54:34,465 --> 00:54:36,505
How many men
did you bring?

658
00:54:39,589 --> 00:54:41,129
Not enough.

659
00:54:41,130 --> 00:54:42,756
The big woman?

660
00:54:46,088 --> 00:54:48,880
We were hoping some of
your men could help.

661
00:54:48,881 --> 00:54:51,713
- Hmm.
- I'll be staying behind.

662
00:54:51,714 --> 00:54:54,838
I'm a liability out there,
as you well know.

663
00:54:54,839 --> 00:54:55,839
You are.

664
00:54:58,631 --> 00:55:01,839
You really want to go out there?
Again?

665
00:55:08,130 --> 00:55:09,881
You're not
the only ones.

666
00:55:13,505 --> 00:55:17,004
My scouts found them
a mile south of the Wall.

667
00:55:17,005 --> 00:55:18,881
Said they were
on their way here.

668
00:55:25,714 --> 00:55:27,172
You're the Hound.

669
00:55:29,172 --> 00:55:31,005
I saw you once
at Winterfell.

670
00:55:36,714 --> 00:55:38,880
They want to go
beyond the Wall, too.

671
00:55:38,881 --> 00:55:42,171
We don't want to go beyond
the Wall, we have to.

672
00:55:42,172 --> 00:55:44,338
Our Lord told us that
the Great War is coming...

673
00:55:44,339 --> 00:55:46,546
Don't trust him.

674
00:55:46,547 --> 00:55:48,505
Don't trust
any of them.

675
00:55:54,130 --> 00:55:55,755
They're the Brotherhood.

676
00:55:55,756 --> 00:55:58,338
And the last thing
their lord told them to do

677
00:55:58,339 --> 00:56:00,713
was sell me to a red witch
to be murdered.

678
00:56:00,714 --> 00:56:02,422
Thoros?

679
00:56:07,464 --> 00:56:09,546
I hardly
recognized you.

680
00:56:09,547 --> 00:56:11,755
Ser Jorah Mormont.

681
00:56:11,756 --> 00:56:14,713
They won't give me anything
to drink down here.

682
00:56:14,714 --> 00:56:17,755
I haven't been feeling
like myself.

683
00:56:17,756 --> 00:56:20,588
You're a fucking Mormont?

684
00:56:20,589 --> 00:56:22,713
Like the last
Lord Commander?

685
00:56:22,714 --> 00:56:24,921
He was my father.

686
00:56:24,922 --> 00:56:27,921
He hunted us
like animals.

687
00:56:27,922 --> 00:56:30,962
You returned the favor,
as I recall.

688
00:56:32,631 --> 00:56:35,254
Here we all are

689
00:56:35,255 --> 00:56:36,838
at the edge
of the world

690
00:56:36,839 --> 00:56:38,421
at the same moment,

691
00:56:38,422 --> 00:56:40,922
heading in the same direction
for the same reason.

692
00:56:42,756 --> 00:56:45,004
Our reasons
aren't your reasons.

693
00:56:45,005 --> 00:56:47,380
It doesn't matter
what we think our reasons are.

694
00:56:49,589 --> 00:56:51,379
There's a greater
purpose at work.

695
00:56:51,380 --> 00:56:54,671
And we serve it
together,

696
00:56:54,672 --> 00:56:56,962
whether we
know it or not.

697
00:56:56,963 --> 00:56:59,880
We may take the steps,
but the Lord of Light...

698
00:56:59,881 --> 00:57:03,254
For fuck's sake,
will you shut your hole?

699
00:57:03,255 --> 00:57:06,046
Are we coming
with you or not?

700
00:57:06,047 --> 00:57:08,254
Don't you want to know
what we're doing?

701
00:57:08,255 --> 00:57:12,671
Is it worse than sitting in a
freezing cell, waiting to die?

702
00:57:12,672 --> 00:57:14,671
He's right.

703
00:57:14,672 --> 00:57:16,672
We're all
on the same side.

704
00:57:19,172 --> 00:57:20,297
How can we be?

705
00:57:21,922 --> 00:57:24,005
We're all breathing.

706
00:59:56,797 --> 00:59:58,505
Death is the enemy.

707
01:00:03,589 --> 01:00:05,922
The first enemy and the last.

708
01:00:10,130 --> 01:00:11,714
The enemy always wins.

709
01:00:14,756 --> 01:00:16,172
And we still need to fight him.

710
01:00:19,963 --> 01:00:21,797
You're scared, aren't you?

711
01:00:24,088 --> 01:00:25,631
What are you scared of?
