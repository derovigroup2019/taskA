1
00:00:08,875 --> 00:00:11,207
I wish you all
the happiness in the world.

2
00:00:14,166 --> 00:00:16,833
-JAIME LANNISTER: Myrcella?
-(PANTING)

3
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:19,000
Myrcella?

4
00:00:29,791 --> 00:00:31,291
(SCREAMS)

5
00:00:32,082 --> 00:00:33,207
Kill us!

6
00:00:42,124 --> 00:00:44,166
I may have found a way
to treat Ser Jorah.

7
00:00:44,166 --> 00:00:45,875
Please try not to scream.

8
00:00:46,207 --> 00:00:48,207
(GRUNTING)

9
00:00:49,541 --> 00:00:51,374
MEERA REED:
This is Brandon Stark.

10
00:00:52,041 --> 00:00:53,374
Son of Ned Stark.

11
00:00:53,708 --> 00:00:55,207
Let's get them inside.

12
00:00:56,416 --> 00:00:57,875
TYRION LANNISTER: For decades,
House Lannister

13
00:00:57,875 --> 00:00:59,583
has been
the true power in Westeros,

14
00:00:59,875 --> 00:01:02,624
and the feat of that power
is Casterly Rock.

15
00:01:02,624 --> 00:01:05,041
Grey Worm and the Unsullied
will sail for the Rock,

16
00:01:05,041 --> 00:01:06,082
and take it.

17
00:01:06,374 --> 00:01:07,583
Summon Jon Snow.

18
00:01:07,875 --> 00:01:09,374
TYRION: He would make
a valuable ally.

19
00:01:09,958 --> 00:01:12,082
MELISANDRE: Let him stand before
you and tell you the things

20
00:01:12,082 --> 00:01:13,124
that have happened to him.

21
00:01:13,541 --> 00:01:16,374
Dragonstone sits
on a mountain of dragonglass.

22
00:01:16,708 --> 00:01:20,207
We can never hope to defeat
the army of the dead alone.

23
00:01:20,416 --> 00:01:21,374
We need allies.

24
00:01:22,082 --> 00:01:25,249
You're abandoning your people!
You're abandoning your home.

25
00:01:25,249 --> 00:01:27,916
Until I return,
the North is yours.

26
00:01:39,082 --> 00:01:41,916
( theme music playing )

27
00:04:02,374 --> 00:04:04,249
The bastard
of Winterfell.

28
00:04:05,458 --> 00:04:07,666
The dwarf
of Casterly Rock.

29
00:04:12,916 --> 00:04:15,041
I believe we last saw
each other atop the Wall.

30
00:04:15,041 --> 00:04:18,958
You were pissing off the edge
if I remember right.

31
00:04:18,958 --> 00:04:21,416
Picked up some scars
along the road.

32
00:04:21,416 --> 00:04:25,916
It's been a long road,
but we're both still here.

33
00:04:27,916 --> 00:04:29,416
I'm Tyrion Lannister.

34
00:04:29,416 --> 00:04:33,249
- Davos Seaworth.
- Ah, the Onion Knight.

35
00:04:33,249 --> 00:04:36,332
We fought on opposite sides at
the Battle of Blackwater Bay.

36
00:04:36,332 --> 00:04:38,916
Unluckily for me.

37
00:04:38,916 --> 00:04:41,958
Missandei is the queen's
most trusted advisor.

38
00:04:43,624 --> 00:04:45,332
Welcome to Dragonstone.

39
00:04:45,332 --> 00:04:47,166
Our queen knows
it is a long journey.

40
00:04:47,166 --> 00:04:50,541
She appreciates the efforts
you have made on her behalf.

41
00:04:50,541 --> 00:04:53,291
If you wouldn't mind
handing over your weapons.

42
00:04:58,916 --> 00:05:00,291
Of course.

43
00:05:17,791 --> 00:05:20,583
( men murmuring )

44
00:05:24,916 --> 00:05:26,458
Please, this way.

45
00:05:31,166 --> 00:05:32,791
Where are you from?

46
00:05:32,791 --> 00:05:35,082
I can't place
the accent.

47
00:05:35,082 --> 00:05:36,916
I was born on
the Island of Naath.

48
00:05:36,916 --> 00:05:40,000
Ah. I hear it's
beautiful down there.

49
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,082
Palm trees
and butterflies.

50
00:05:42,082 --> 00:05:43,499
Haven't been, myself.

51
00:05:47,666 --> 00:05:49,458
This place has changed.

52
00:05:55,833 --> 00:05:58,958
Tyrion: And Sansa? I hear
she's alive and well.

53
00:05:58,958 --> 00:06:01,458
- Jon: She is.
- Does she miss me terribly?

54
00:06:04,624 --> 00:06:07,041
A sham marriage.
And unconsummated.

55
00:06:07,041 --> 00:06:10,207
- I didn't ask.
- Well, it was. Wasn't.

56
00:06:10,207 --> 00:06:12,124
Anyway...

57
00:06:12,124 --> 00:06:14,958
she's much smarter
than she lets on.

58
00:06:14,958 --> 00:06:17,332
She's starting
to let on.

59
00:06:17,332 --> 00:06:18,249
Good.

60
00:06:18,249 --> 00:06:20,291
Tyrion:
At some point,

61
00:06:20,291 --> 00:06:24,249
I want to hear how a Night's Watch
recruit became King in the North.

62
00:06:24,249 --> 00:06:26,041
As long as you tell me
how a Lannister

63
00:06:26,041 --> 00:06:28,833
became Hand
to Daenerys Targaryen.

64
00:06:28,833 --> 00:06:30,958
A long
and bloody tale.

65
00:06:30,958 --> 00:06:33,708
To be honest,
I was drunk for most of it.

66
00:06:36,332 --> 00:06:38,875
My bannermen think
I'm a fool for coming here.

67
00:06:38,875 --> 00:06:40,291
Of course they do.

68
00:06:40,291 --> 00:06:43,000
If I was your Hand, I would
have advised against it.

69
00:06:45,624 --> 00:06:47,541
General rule of thumb--

70
00:06:47,541 --> 00:06:50,666
Stark men don't fare well
when they travel south.

71
00:06:50,666 --> 00:06:52,416
True...

72
00:06:52,416 --> 00:06:54,541
but I'm not a Stark.

73
00:06:54,541 --> 00:06:57,875
( screeching )

74
00:07:01,332 --> 00:07:02,416
( panting )

75
00:07:08,791 --> 00:07:10,041
I'd say you get
used to them...

76
00:07:12,791 --> 00:07:14,249
but you never
really do.

77
00:07:17,791 --> 00:07:21,041
Come, their mother
is waiting for you.

78
00:07:33,416 --> 00:07:37,000
I wondered why you weren't
there to meet our guests.

79
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
You begged us to summon
the King in the North.

80
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,458
Don't you want
to see him again?

81
00:07:42,458 --> 00:07:45,082
I've done my part.

82
00:07:45,082 --> 00:07:47,499
I've brought
ice and fire together.

83
00:07:47,499 --> 00:07:49,791
Strange.

84
00:07:49,791 --> 00:07:52,291
You spoke so highly
of Jon Snow,

85
00:07:52,291 --> 00:07:55,958
but when he arrives,
you hide on a cliff.

86
00:07:55,958 --> 00:07:58,332
I didn't take you
for a bashful girl.

87
00:07:58,332 --> 00:08:02,541
My time whispering in the ears
of kings has come to an end.

88
00:08:02,541 --> 00:08:04,958
Oh, I doubt that.

89
00:08:04,958 --> 00:08:07,583
Give us common folk
one taste of power,

90
00:08:07,583 --> 00:08:10,416
we're like the lion
who tasted man.

91
00:08:10,416 --> 00:08:13,666
Nothing is ever
so sweet again.

92
00:08:13,666 --> 00:08:16,916
Neither of us
is common folk anymore.

93
00:08:19,041 --> 00:08:20,833
I did not part
on good terms

94
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:23,833
with the King in the North
or his advisor.

95
00:08:23,833 --> 00:08:24,666
Why?

96
00:08:26,499 --> 00:08:28,541
Because of
mistakes I made.

97
00:08:30,666 --> 00:08:32,541
Terrible mistakes.

98
00:08:34,374 --> 00:08:37,499
I would only be
a distraction if I stayed.

99
00:08:37,499 --> 00:08:39,708
- So, where will you go?
- Volantis.

100
00:08:39,708 --> 00:08:41,708
Good.

101
00:08:41,708 --> 00:08:43,958
If you don't mind
my saying,

102
00:08:43,958 --> 00:08:47,708
I don't think you should
return to Westeros.

103
00:08:47,708 --> 00:08:50,166
I'm not sure
you'd be safe here.

104
00:08:52,082 --> 00:08:55,291
Oh, I will return,
dear Spider.

105
00:08:55,291 --> 00:08:57,082
- One last time.
- My lady--

106
00:08:57,082 --> 00:09:00,666
I have to die
in this strange country.

107
00:09:00,666 --> 00:09:02,499
Just like you.

108
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:46,374
Missandei:
You stand in the presence

109
00:09:46,374 --> 00:09:49,166
of Daenerys Stormborn
of House Targaryen,

110
00:09:49,166 --> 00:09:51,374
rightful heir
to the Iron Throne,

111
00:09:51,374 --> 00:09:54,332
rightful Queen of the Andals
and the First Men,

112
00:09:54,332 --> 00:09:56,750
Protector
of the Seven Kingdoms,

113
00:09:56,750 --> 00:09:58,458
the Mother of Dragons,

114
00:09:58,458 --> 00:10:00,666
the Khaleesi
of the Great Grass Sea,

115
00:10:00,666 --> 00:10:04,458
the Unburnt,
the Breaker of Chains.

116
00:10:09,583 --> 00:10:11,249
This is Jon Snow.

117
00:10:15,249 --> 00:10:17,041
He's King
in the North.

118
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:21,916
Thank you for traveling
so far, my lord.

119
00:10:21,916 --> 00:10:24,166
I hope the seas
weren't too rough.

120
00:10:24,166 --> 00:10:25,750
The winds were kind,
Your Grace.

121
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:29,750
Apologies, I have a Flea
Bottom accent, I know,

122
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:32,624
but Jon Snow is King in
the North, Your Grace.

123
00:10:32,624 --> 00:10:34,458
- He's not a lord.
- Forgive me--

124
00:10:34,458 --> 00:10:36,708
Your Grace, this is
Ser Davos Seaworth.

125
00:10:36,708 --> 00:10:38,624
Forgive me,
Ser Davos.

126
00:10:38,624 --> 00:10:41,249
I never did receive
a formal education,

127
00:10:41,249 --> 00:10:42,583
but I could have
sworn I read

128
00:10:42,583 --> 00:10:45,875
the last King in the
North was Torrhen Stark,

129
00:10:45,875 --> 00:10:49,041
who bent the knee to my
ancestor, Aegon Targaryen.

130
00:10:49,041 --> 00:10:52,249
In exchange for his life
and the lives of the Northmen,

131
00:10:52,249 --> 00:10:57,291
Torrhen Stark swore fealty to
House Targaryen in perpetuity.

132
00:10:57,291 --> 00:10:58,791
Or do I have
my facts wrong?

133
00:10:58,791 --> 00:11:01,124
I wasn't there,
Your Grace.

134
00:11:01,124 --> 00:11:03,541
No, of course not.

135
00:11:03,541 --> 00:11:06,124
But still,
an oath is an oath.

136
00:11:06,124 --> 00:11:08,541
And perpetuity means--

137
00:11:08,541 --> 00:11:11,000
what does perpetuity mean,
Lord Tyrion?

138
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,499
Forever.

139
00:11:12,499 --> 00:11:14,583
Forever.

140
00:11:14,583 --> 00:11:17,416
- So I assume, my lord...
- ( sighs )

141
00:11:17,416 --> 00:11:19,624
...you're here
to bend the knee.

142
00:11:22,166 --> 00:11:23,708
I am not.

143
00:11:25,332 --> 00:11:26,833
Oh.

144
00:11:26,833 --> 00:11:28,666
Well, that is
unfortunate.

145
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,666
You've traveled
all this way

146
00:11:31,666 --> 00:11:33,833
to break faith
with House Targaryen?

147
00:11:33,833 --> 00:11:36,332
Break faith?

148
00:11:36,332 --> 00:11:38,666
Your father burned
my grandfather alive.

149
00:11:38,666 --> 00:11:40,374
He burned
my uncle alive.

150
00:11:40,374 --> 00:11:41,708
He would have burned
the Seven Kingdoms--

151
00:11:41,708 --> 00:11:44,791
My father...
was an evil man.

152
00:11:46,624 --> 00:11:48,833
On behalf
of House Targaryen...

153
00:11:50,082 --> 00:11:51,708
I ask your forgiveness

154
00:11:51,708 --> 00:11:54,666
for the crimes he committed
against your family.

155
00:11:54,666 --> 00:11:57,541
And I ask you
not to judge a daughter

156
00:11:57,541 --> 00:11:59,916
by the sins
of her father.

157
00:12:01,374 --> 00:12:04,875
Our two houses
were allies for centuries,

158
00:12:04,875 --> 00:12:06,750
and those were
the best centuries

159
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:08,875
the Seven Kingdoms
have ever known.

160
00:12:08,875 --> 00:12:11,374
Centuries of peace
and prosperity

161
00:12:11,374 --> 00:12:14,207
with a Targaryen
sitting on the Iron Throne

162
00:12:14,207 --> 00:12:18,207
and a Stark serving
as Warden of the North.

163
00:12:18,207 --> 00:12:21,958
I am the last Targaryen,
Jon Snow.

164
00:12:21,958 --> 00:12:24,374
Honor the pledge
your ancestor made to mine.

165
00:12:24,374 --> 00:12:28,041
Bend the knee and I will name
you Warden of the North.

166
00:12:28,041 --> 00:12:30,249
Together, we will
save this country

167
00:12:30,249 --> 00:12:32,875
from those
who would destroy it.

168
00:12:42,708 --> 00:12:44,750
You're right.

169
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:47,249
You're not guilty
of your father's crimes.

170
00:12:47,249 --> 00:12:52,082
And I'm not beholden
to my ancestor's vows.

171
00:12:52,082 --> 00:12:54,082
Then why are you here?

172
00:12:54,082 --> 00:12:56,916
Because I need your help,
and you need mine.

173
00:13:00,124 --> 00:13:02,082
Did you see
three dragons

174
00:13:02,082 --> 00:13:04,041
flying overhead
when you arrived?

175
00:13:04,041 --> 00:13:05,124
I did.

176
00:13:05,124 --> 00:13:07,416
And did you see
the Dothraki,

177
00:13:07,416 --> 00:13:09,624
all of whom have sworn
to kill for me?

178
00:13:09,624 --> 00:13:11,583
They're hard to miss.

179
00:13:11,583 --> 00:13:15,624
- But still, I need your help?
- Davos: Not to defeat Cersei.

180
00:13:15,624 --> 00:13:18,958
You could storm King's Landing
tomorrow and the city would fall.

181
00:13:18,958 --> 00:13:21,207
Hell, we almost took it and
we didn't even have dragons.

182
00:13:21,207 --> 00:13:25,332
- Almost.
- But you haven't stormed King's Landing.

183
00:13:25,332 --> 00:13:26,958
Why not?

184
00:13:26,958 --> 00:13:28,666
The only reason
I can see

185
00:13:28,666 --> 00:13:30,916
is you don't want to kill
thousands of innocent people.

186
00:13:30,916 --> 00:13:32,958
It's the fastest way
to win the war,

187
00:13:32,958 --> 00:13:34,791
but you won't do it,

188
00:13:34,791 --> 00:13:38,000
which means,
at the very least,

189
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,458
you're better
than Cersei.

190
00:13:40,958 --> 00:13:44,332
Still, that doesn't explain
why I need your help.

191
00:13:46,207 --> 00:13:50,833
Because right now, you and I
and Cersei and everyone else,

192
00:13:50,833 --> 00:13:52,458
we're children
playing at a game,

193
00:13:52,458 --> 00:13:54,541
screaming that
the rules aren't fair.

194
00:13:54,541 --> 00:13:56,666
- You told me you liked this man.
- I do.

195
00:13:56,666 --> 00:14:00,166
In the time since he's met me,
he's refused to call me queen,

196
00:14:00,166 --> 00:14:03,041
he's refused to bow, and now
he's calling me a child.

197
00:14:03,041 --> 00:14:06,833
I believe he's calling all of us children.
Figure of speech.

198
00:14:06,833 --> 00:14:10,166
Your Grace, everyone you know
will die before winter's over

199
00:14:10,166 --> 00:14:12,332
if we don't defeat
the enemy to the north.

200
00:14:12,332 --> 00:14:15,000
As far as I can see, you are
the enemy to the north.

201
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,666
I am not your enemy.

202
00:14:18,082 --> 00:14:20,000
The dead
are the enemy.

203
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,541
The dead?

204
00:14:22,833 --> 00:14:24,416
Is that another
figure of speech?

205
00:14:24,416 --> 00:14:26,041
The Army of the Dead
is on the march.

206
00:14:26,041 --> 00:14:28,124
The Army of the Dead?

207
00:14:28,124 --> 00:14:30,291
You don't know me well, my lord,

208
00:14:30,291 --> 00:14:33,624
but do you think
I'm a liar or a madman?

209
00:14:33,624 --> 00:14:36,166
No, I don't think
you're either of those things.

210
00:14:36,166 --> 00:14:38,291
The Army of the Dead
is real.

211
00:14:38,291 --> 00:14:39,750
The white walkers
are real.

212
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:42,666
The Night King is real.
I've seen them.

213
00:14:42,666 --> 00:14:44,207
If they get
past the Wall

214
00:14:44,207 --> 00:14:46,708
and we're squabbling
amongst ourselves...

215
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:51,332
we're finished.

216
00:14:56,916 --> 00:14:59,207
I was born
at Dragonstone.

217
00:15:00,833 --> 00:15:03,541
Not that I can
remember it.

218
00:15:03,541 --> 00:15:07,000
We fled before Robert's
assassins could find us.

219
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,207
Robert was your father's
best friend, no?

220
00:15:10,207 --> 00:15:14,041
I wonder if your father knew
his best friend sent assassins

221
00:15:14,041 --> 00:15:16,583
to murder a baby girl
in her crib.

222
00:15:18,041 --> 00:15:19,958
Not that it matters now,
of course.

223
00:15:21,499 --> 00:15:25,041
I spent my life
in foreign lands.

224
00:15:25,041 --> 00:15:27,416
So many men
have tried to kill me,

225
00:15:27,416 --> 00:15:30,916
I don't remember
all their names.

226
00:15:30,916 --> 00:15:35,000
I have been sold
like a broodmare.

227
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,541
I've been chained
and betrayed,

228
00:15:38,541 --> 00:15:41,332
raped and defiled.

229
00:15:41,332 --> 00:15:43,583
Do you know
what kept me standing

230
00:15:43,583 --> 00:15:46,541
through all those years
in exile?

231
00:15:46,541 --> 00:15:49,499
Faith.

232
00:15:49,499 --> 00:15:51,750
Not in any gods,

233
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:55,291
not in myths
and legends.

234
00:15:55,291 --> 00:15:57,916
In myself.

235
00:15:57,916 --> 00:16:01,082
In Daenerys Targaryen.

236
00:16:01,082 --> 00:16:04,624
The world hadn't seen
a dragon in centuries

237
00:16:04,624 --> 00:16:07,000
until my children
were born.

238
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:11,791
The Dothraki hadn't
crossed the sea, any sea.

239
00:16:11,791 --> 00:16:14,166
They did for me.

240
00:16:14,166 --> 00:16:18,624
I was born to rule
the Seven Kingdoms,

241
00:16:18,624 --> 00:16:20,750
and I will.

242
00:16:23,082 --> 00:16:25,624
You'll be ruling
over a graveyard

243
00:16:25,624 --> 00:16:27,958
if we don't defeat
the Night King.

244
00:16:29,374 --> 00:16:32,583
The war against my sister
has already begun.

245
00:16:32,583 --> 00:16:34,958
You can't expect us
to halt hostilities

246
00:16:34,958 --> 00:16:36,791
and join you
in fighting

247
00:16:36,791 --> 00:16:38,291
whatever you saw
beyond the Wall.

248
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:42,708
You don't believe him.

249
00:16:42,708 --> 00:16:45,624
I understand that.
It sounds like nonsense.

250
00:16:45,624 --> 00:16:49,416
But if destiny has brought Daenerys
Targaryen back to our shores,

251
00:16:49,416 --> 00:16:52,624
it has also made Jon Snow
King in the North.

252
00:16:52,624 --> 00:16:55,750
You were the first to bring
Dothraki to Westeros?

253
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:59,124
He is the first to make allies
of wildlings and Northmen.

254
00:16:59,124 --> 00:17:01,207
He was named Lord Commander
of the Night's Watch.

255
00:17:01,207 --> 00:17:02,291
He was named
King in the North.

256
00:17:02,291 --> 00:17:03,666
Not because
of his birthright.

257
00:17:03,666 --> 00:17:06,041
He has no birthright.
He's a damn bastard.

258
00:17:06,041 --> 00:17:11,082
All those hard sons of bitches
chose him as their leader

259
00:17:11,082 --> 00:17:12,791
because they
believe in him.

260
00:17:14,207 --> 00:17:16,166
All those things
you don't believe in,

261
00:17:16,166 --> 00:17:17,708
he faced
those things.

262
00:17:17,708 --> 00:17:19,916
He fought those things
for the good of his people.

263
00:17:19,916 --> 00:17:21,499
He risked his life
for his people.

264
00:17:21,499 --> 00:17:23,291
He took a knife in the
heart for his people.

265
00:17:23,291 --> 00:17:25,041
He gave his own--

266
00:17:31,207 --> 00:17:33,958
If we don't put aside our
enmities and band together,

267
00:17:33,958 --> 00:17:36,041
we will die.

268
00:17:36,041 --> 00:17:39,708
And then it doesn't matter whose
skeleton sits on the Iron Throne.

269
00:17:39,708 --> 00:17:42,041
If it doesn't matter,
then you might as well kneel.

270
00:17:42,041 --> 00:17:44,207
Swear your allegiance
to Queen Daenerys,

271
00:17:44,207 --> 00:17:45,833
help her to defeat
my sister,

272
00:17:45,833 --> 00:17:48,000
and together, our armies
will protect the North.

273
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,750
There's no time
for that.

274
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:51,666
There's no time
for any of this!

275
00:17:51,666 --> 00:17:53,166
While we stand here,
debating--

276
00:17:53,166 --> 00:17:55,124
It takes no time
to bend the knee.

277
00:17:55,124 --> 00:17:56,958
Pledge your sword
to her cause.

278
00:17:56,958 --> 00:17:58,708
And why
would I do that?

279
00:18:01,583 --> 00:18:03,708
I mean no offense,
Your Grace,

280
00:18:03,708 --> 00:18:04,916
but I don't know you.

281
00:18:04,916 --> 00:18:06,750
As far as I can tell,

282
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:10,041
your claim to the throne rests
entirely on your father's name,

283
00:18:10,041 --> 00:18:13,374
and my own father fought
to overthrow the Mad King.

284
00:18:15,291 --> 00:18:17,166
The lords of the North

285
00:18:17,166 --> 00:18:20,000
placed their trust
in me to lead them,

286
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:24,041
and I will continue to
do so as well as I can.

287
00:18:25,291 --> 00:18:26,750
That's fair.

288
00:18:28,249 --> 00:18:30,124
It's also fair
to point out

289
00:18:30,124 --> 00:18:34,249
that I'm the rightful
Queen of the Seven Kingdoms.

290
00:18:34,249 --> 00:18:38,000
By declaring yourself king
of the northernmost kingdom,

291
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,916
you are in
open rebellion.

292
00:18:39,916 --> 00:18:41,875
( footsteps approaching )

293
00:18:49,875 --> 00:18:52,207
( whispering ) Your Grace,
please dismiss your guests.

294
00:18:52,207 --> 00:18:54,291
I have grave news.

295
00:18:56,833 --> 00:18:58,708
You must forgive
my manners.

296
00:18:58,708 --> 00:19:01,082
You'll both be tired
after your long journey.

297
00:19:01,082 --> 00:19:03,833
We'll have baths drawn for you
and supper sent to your rooms.

298
00:19:05,833 --> 00:19:10,666
( speaking Dothraki )

299
00:19:13,291 --> 00:19:14,624
Am I your prisoner?

300
00:19:18,624 --> 00:19:19,916
Not yet.

301
00:19:37,332 --> 00:19:39,041
Our ironborn
and Dornish allies

302
00:19:39,041 --> 00:19:40,499
were attacked
en route to Dorne.

303
00:19:40,499 --> 00:19:43,000
- And?
- Two or three ships escaped,

304
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,332
the rest,
sunk or captured.

305
00:19:45,332 --> 00:19:47,916
Ellaria and the Sand Snakes,
dead or captured.

306
00:19:47,916 --> 00:19:50,499
The Greyjoys,
dead or captured.

307
00:19:50,499 --> 00:19:52,207
All of them?

308
00:19:53,833 --> 00:19:55,458
( men shouting )

309
00:19:55,458 --> 00:19:57,332
- Pull!
- Heave!

310
00:19:57,332 --> 00:19:58,708
Pull!

311
00:19:58,708 --> 00:20:01,207
( men grunt )

312
00:20:01,207 --> 00:20:02,833
( grunts )

313
00:20:08,958 --> 00:20:10,416
Your sister's dead?

314
00:20:11,916 --> 00:20:13,958
Euron has her.

315
00:20:13,958 --> 00:20:15,332
You saw him take her?

316
00:20:17,624 --> 00:20:21,000
- But you got away?
- I couldn't save her.

317
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,499
I tried.

318
00:20:23,791 --> 00:20:25,875
You wouldn't be here
if you tried.

319
00:20:30,374 --> 00:20:32,249
Man:
Come, men!

320
00:20:32,249 --> 00:20:33,583
Sails up!

321
00:20:38,041 --> 00:20:40,000
( crowd cheering )

322
00:20:42,207 --> 00:20:44,207
Woman:
Murderer!

323
00:20:54,958 --> 00:20:57,082
Man:
Whores!

324
00:20:57,082 --> 00:20:59,416
- ( all shouting )
- Traitor!

325
00:21:03,249 --> 00:21:04,541
This is the life.

326
00:21:05,750 --> 00:21:09,416
Look at them,
cheering for a Greyjoy.

327
00:21:09,416 --> 00:21:10,916
( cheering )

328
00:21:10,916 --> 00:21:13,750
- ( grunts )
- ( laughter )

329
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:15,332
I have to be honest,

330
00:21:15,332 --> 00:21:17,291
this is making me hard.

331
00:21:20,291 --> 00:21:22,000
Did you see
Little Theon's face

332
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,374
right before
he jumped overboard?

333
00:21:24,374 --> 00:21:26,916
"Oh, no!"
( laughs )

334
00:21:26,916 --> 00:21:28,374
What a twat.

335
00:21:29,875 --> 00:21:32,082
( crowd booing )

336
00:21:34,166 --> 00:21:36,583
- ( crowd shouting )
- ( spits )

337
00:21:56,124 --> 00:21:59,082
- Man: Whore! Whore! Whore!
- Man #2: Murderers!

338
00:22:03,124 --> 00:22:05,000
( applause )

339
00:22:31,041 --> 00:22:32,374
( grunts )

340
00:22:32,374 --> 00:22:35,708
My queen, please
accept this gift

341
00:22:35,708 --> 00:22:39,541
on behalf of all of your loyal
subjects in the Iron Islands.

342
00:22:40,666 --> 00:22:41,666
( both grunt, gasp )

343
00:22:44,499 --> 00:22:48,708
I give you what no
other man could give--

344
00:22:48,708 --> 00:22:50,833
justice.

345
00:22:50,833 --> 00:22:54,499
Justice for your
murdered daughter.

346
00:23:04,041 --> 00:23:08,041
You've proven yourself the greatest
captain on the fourteen seas

347
00:23:08,041 --> 00:23:10,708
and a true friend
to the crown.

348
00:23:10,708 --> 00:23:13,916
You deserve more
than a true friend.

349
00:23:13,916 --> 00:23:17,416
And you deserve a proper
reward for your heroism.

350
00:23:17,416 --> 00:23:20,082
There's only
one reward I want.

351
00:23:21,374 --> 00:23:24,082
You shall have
what your heart desires...

352
00:23:26,124 --> 00:23:27,666
when the war is won.

353
00:23:34,041 --> 00:23:37,499
With Euron Greyjoy
commanding our naval forces

354
00:23:37,499 --> 00:23:40,666
and Jaime Lannister
leading our armies,

355
00:23:40,666 --> 00:23:42,708
the sons and daughters
of Westeros

356
00:23:42,708 --> 00:23:45,000
shall defend our country.

357
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,458
( crowd cheering )

358
00:23:51,499 --> 00:23:54,249
There's nothing quite
like it, is there?

359
00:23:54,249 --> 00:23:56,000
The love of the people.

360
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,124
Though I suppose
you wouldn't know.

361
00:23:58,124 --> 00:24:01,458
This same mob spat at
my sister not long ago.

362
00:24:01,458 --> 00:24:03,207
And if you turn
on us,

363
00:24:03,207 --> 00:24:06,416
they'll cheer to see your
head mounted on a spike.

364
00:24:06,416 --> 00:24:07,916
Or yours.

365
00:24:07,916 --> 00:24:11,041
They just like
severed heads, really.

366
00:24:11,041 --> 00:24:14,291
Listen, if you have
any advice at all,

367
00:24:14,291 --> 00:24:15,875
I would love to hear it.

368
00:24:15,875 --> 00:24:18,916
When we have an hour or two
to speak as brothers.

369
00:24:18,916 --> 00:24:20,624
Advice?

370
00:24:20,624 --> 00:24:24,291
Does she like it
gentle or rough?

371
00:24:24,291 --> 00:24:25,958
A finger in the bum?

372
00:24:25,958 --> 00:24:29,249
Shh, shh, shh, shh, not now.
We'll talk later.

373
00:24:47,082 --> 00:24:50,041
Cersei: I want you to
know I understand.

374
00:24:50,041 --> 00:24:51,624
Even though we're
enemies, you and I,

375
00:24:51,624 --> 00:24:53,291
I understand the fury
that drives you.

376
00:24:54,458 --> 00:24:55,791
I was there that day

377
00:24:55,791 --> 00:24:57,583
when Ser Gregor crushed
your lover's head.

378
00:25:00,124 --> 00:25:02,458
If I close my eyes,

379
00:25:02,458 --> 00:25:05,458
- I can hear the sound of Oberyn's
skull breaking. - ( grunts )

380
00:25:05,458 --> 00:25:07,666
The sound
of your scream.

381
00:25:07,666 --> 00:25:09,166
I never heard
a sound like that.

382
00:25:09,166 --> 00:25:11,124
I thought,
"That's true love."

383
00:25:12,708 --> 00:25:15,000
Oberyn looked beautiful that day.
He really did.

384
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,374
No one moved like him.

385
00:25:16,374 --> 00:25:19,499
No one had such skill
with a spear.

386
00:25:19,499 --> 00:25:22,583
Even Ser Gregor
couldn't stop him.

387
00:25:22,583 --> 00:25:25,041
If only he hadn't
taunted him.

388
00:25:25,041 --> 00:25:29,000
He could've walked away and
left poor Ser Gregor to die.

389
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,041
But that wasn't
your lover's way, was it?

390
00:25:31,041 --> 00:25:33,875
Now he's buried
somewhere.

391
00:25:33,875 --> 00:25:36,624
And here's Ser Gregor,
stronger than ever.

392
00:25:36,624 --> 00:25:38,541
That must be
difficult for you.

393
00:25:42,499 --> 00:25:44,499
When my daughter
was taken from me,

394
00:25:44,499 --> 00:25:47,624
my only daughter...

395
00:25:47,624 --> 00:25:50,416
well, you can't
imagine how that feels

396
00:25:50,416 --> 00:25:52,666
unless you've
lost a child.

397
00:25:52,666 --> 00:25:55,332
I fed her at my own breast
even though they told me

398
00:25:55,332 --> 00:25:58,041
to give her
to the wet nurse.

399
00:25:58,041 --> 00:26:01,541
I couldn't bear to see her
in another woman's arms.

400
00:26:01,541 --> 00:26:03,791
I never got
to have a mother,

401
00:26:03,791 --> 00:26:05,207
but Myrcella did.

402
00:26:05,207 --> 00:26:08,875
She was mine,
and you took her from me.

403
00:26:08,875 --> 00:26:10,916
Why did you do that?

404
00:26:17,499 --> 00:26:18,875
Doesn't matter now.

405
00:26:27,458 --> 00:26:30,207
Your daughter's
a beauty, too.

406
00:26:30,207 --> 00:26:32,833
Those brown eyes.

407
00:26:32,833 --> 00:26:34,541
Those lips.

408
00:26:36,166 --> 00:26:38,207
Perfect Dornish beauty.

409
00:26:38,207 --> 00:26:40,082
I imagine
she's your favorite.

410
00:26:40,082 --> 00:26:43,249
I know, I know, we're not
supposed to have favorites,

411
00:26:43,249 --> 00:26:45,416
but still,
we're only human.

412
00:26:46,916 --> 00:26:48,499
We love whom we love.

413
00:26:48,499 --> 00:26:50,082
( muffled speech )

414
00:26:51,374 --> 00:26:53,374
I'm sorry,
I can't understand you.

415
00:26:53,374 --> 00:26:56,750
That gag makes it impossible to
understand what you're saying.

416
00:26:56,750 --> 00:26:58,583
It must be frustrating.

417
00:27:01,750 --> 00:27:04,750
We all make
our choices.

418
00:27:04,750 --> 00:27:07,166
You chose to murder
my daughter.

419
00:27:07,166 --> 00:27:09,416
You must have felt powerful
after you made that choice.

420
00:27:09,416 --> 00:27:11,624
- ( grunts )
- Do you feel powerful now?

421
00:27:18,207 --> 00:27:19,583
I don't sleep very well.

422
00:27:19,583 --> 00:27:21,958
Not at all, really.

423
00:27:21,958 --> 00:27:23,875
I lie in bed
and I stare at the canopy

424
00:27:23,875 --> 00:27:26,249
and imagine ways
of killing my enemies.

425
00:27:26,249 --> 00:27:30,124
How to destroy Ellaria Sand, the
woman who murdered my only daughter.

426
00:27:31,624 --> 00:27:33,291
I thought about
having Ser Gregor

427
00:27:33,291 --> 00:27:35,458
crush your skull
the way he did Oberyn's.

428
00:27:35,458 --> 00:27:40,166
It would be poetic, I
suppose, but fast, too fast.

429
00:27:40,166 --> 00:27:43,124
I thought about having him
crush your daughter's skull.

430
00:27:44,207 --> 00:27:45,958
She's so beautiful.

431
00:27:47,207 --> 00:27:48,875
The thought
of this lovely face

432
00:27:48,875 --> 00:27:51,291
cracking open
like a duck egg,

433
00:27:51,291 --> 00:27:53,041
no, it's just not right.

434
00:27:54,499 --> 00:27:56,666
- ( Tyene whimpers )
- ( gasps )

435
00:28:00,499 --> 00:28:01,624
Mama.

436
00:28:01,624 --> 00:28:03,374
( grunts )

437
00:28:03,374 --> 00:28:05,332
( crying )

438
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,332
Qyburn here is
the cleverest man I know.

439
00:28:14,332 --> 00:28:17,416
Clever enough to learn what poison
you used to murder Myrcella.

440
00:28:17,416 --> 00:28:19,082
The Long Goodbye,
was that it?

441
00:28:19,082 --> 00:28:21,166
- The Long Farewell.
- That's the one.

442
00:28:25,499 --> 00:28:27,000
How long does
the poison take?

443
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,666
Qyburn: Difficult to
say-- hours, days.

444
00:28:29,666 --> 00:28:31,541
It depends on the
subject's constitution.

445
00:28:31,541 --> 00:28:35,041
- But death is certain?
- Oh, yes, Your Grace, quite certain.

446
00:28:40,416 --> 00:28:43,291
Your daughter will die
here in this cell,

447
00:28:43,291 --> 00:28:46,416
and you will be here
watching when she does.

448
00:28:46,416 --> 00:28:49,207
You'll be here
the rest of your days.

449
00:28:51,082 --> 00:28:55,041
If you refuse to eat, we'll
force food down your throat.

450
00:28:55,041 --> 00:28:58,750
You will live to watch
your daughter rot.

451
00:28:58,750 --> 00:29:02,041
- To watch that beautiful face collapse...
- ( sobbing )

452
00:29:02,041 --> 00:29:04,166
...to bone and dust.

453
00:29:06,541 --> 00:29:09,499
All the while contemplating
the choices you've made.

454
00:29:12,583 --> 00:29:15,207
Make sure the guards change
the torches every few hours.

455
00:29:15,207 --> 00:29:16,624
I don't want her
to miss a thing.

456
00:29:21,416 --> 00:29:24,124
( both crying )

457
00:29:47,624 --> 00:29:48,875
No.

458
00:30:12,666 --> 00:30:14,666
( panting )

459
00:30:17,458 --> 00:30:20,291
( birds chirping )

460
00:30:26,791 --> 00:30:28,000
( knocking on door )

461
00:30:31,124 --> 00:30:32,124
Don't.

462
00:30:44,166 --> 00:30:47,000
What are you doing?
No one can see us like this.

463
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:50,666
I am the Queen of the Seven Kingdoms.
I'll do as I please.

464
00:30:56,207 --> 00:30:57,332
Forgive me, Your Grace.

465
00:30:57,332 --> 00:30:59,666
The visitor from Braavos
has arrived.

466
00:30:59,666 --> 00:31:02,666
Good. And we'll need
fresh sheets for the bed.

467
00:31:02,666 --> 00:31:04,000
At once, Your Grace.

468
00:31:06,916 --> 00:31:08,374
( chuckles )

469
00:31:08,374 --> 00:31:09,374
( liquid pouring )

470
00:31:14,875 --> 00:31:17,249
No, thank you.

471
00:31:17,249 --> 00:31:18,958
My condolences,
Your Grace,

472
00:31:18,958 --> 00:31:20,916
on the death
of your son.

473
00:31:20,916 --> 00:31:23,624
From all reports,
he was a fine young man.

474
00:31:23,624 --> 00:31:26,374
The Iron Bank didn't send you
here to offer condolences.

475
00:31:26,374 --> 00:31:29,875
Condolences
and congratulations.

476
00:31:29,875 --> 00:31:32,833
To become the first ruling
Queen of the Seven Kingdoms,

477
00:31:32,833 --> 00:31:34,833
that's quite
an accomplishment.

478
00:31:34,833 --> 00:31:38,624
The Iron Bank appreciates how you
cast off the yoke of superstition,

479
00:31:38,624 --> 00:31:40,207
freeing the crown
from elements

480
00:31:40,207 --> 00:31:42,708
who sought to subvert
the rule of law.

481
00:31:42,708 --> 00:31:45,875
The destruction of the Sept of
Baelor was a tragic accident.

482
00:31:45,875 --> 00:31:50,082
Indeed, but sometimes
tragedies are necessary

483
00:31:50,082 --> 00:31:52,458
to restore order
and rational leadership.

484
00:31:52,458 --> 00:31:55,207
The Iron Bank
wants its gold back.

485
00:31:55,207 --> 00:31:57,791
Your father never
minced words either.

486
00:31:57,791 --> 00:32:01,624
But, yes, your debts
are considerable.

487
00:32:01,624 --> 00:32:04,499
And you're now engaged in a
conflict on several fronts.

488
00:32:04,499 --> 00:32:07,416
We both know how
expensive war can be.

489
00:32:07,416 --> 00:32:09,624
And we both know
gold wins wars.

490
00:32:09,624 --> 00:32:11,082
Your vaults are empty.

491
00:32:11,082 --> 00:32:13,583
Your late husband's
profligacy saw to that.

492
00:32:13,583 --> 00:32:16,916
Your wealthiest allies, the
Tyrells, are now your enemies.

493
00:32:16,916 --> 00:32:20,499
You are surrounded on all sides
by rivals for the throne.

494
00:32:20,499 --> 00:32:22,458
And the Iron Bank
wants to bet on a winner.

495
00:32:22,458 --> 00:32:24,166
We don't make bets.

496
00:32:24,166 --> 00:32:27,750
We invest in endeavors we
deem likely to be successful.

497
00:32:27,750 --> 00:32:30,708
A fancy way
of saying "bet."

498
00:32:30,708 --> 00:32:34,458
The war's already begun.
I've drawn first blood.

499
00:32:34,458 --> 00:32:37,458
I decapitated
the Dornish snake.

500
00:32:37,458 --> 00:32:39,499
My armada owns
the Narrow Sea.

501
00:32:39,499 --> 00:32:41,958
Euron Greyjoy's armada
owns the Narrow Sea.

502
00:32:41,958 --> 00:32:43,458
Euron Greyjoy
is loyal to me.

503
00:32:43,458 --> 00:32:45,666
For now.

504
00:32:45,666 --> 00:32:49,416
Daenerys Targaryen has
three full-grown dragons.

505
00:32:49,416 --> 00:32:53,750
How well do wooden ships fare
against fire-breathing dragons?

506
00:32:53,750 --> 00:32:58,791
Her dragons might not be
as invulnerable as some think.

507
00:32:58,791 --> 00:33:01,166
But let's talk about
the Targaryen girl.

508
00:33:01,166 --> 00:33:03,082
You want to
invest in her?

509
00:33:03,082 --> 00:33:07,458
I'm guessing the Iron Bank invested
considerable gold in the slave trade.

510
00:33:07,458 --> 00:33:09,708
How are your profits

511
00:33:09,708 --> 00:33:12,249
now that Daenerys
has freed all the slaves?

512
00:33:12,249 --> 00:33:16,416
The slave trade has entered
a downturn, it's true.

513
00:33:16,416 --> 00:33:18,291
From what I gather,
she considers herself

514
00:33:18,291 --> 00:33:21,624
more of a revolutionary
than a monarch.

515
00:33:21,624 --> 00:33:25,541
In your experience, how do bankers
usually fare with revolutionaries?

516
00:33:25,541 --> 00:33:28,541
The Lannisters owe the Iron
Bank quite a lot of money,

517
00:33:28,541 --> 00:33:30,708
but Lannisters
always pay their debts.

518
00:33:30,708 --> 00:33:35,124
Do former slaves
or Dothraki or dragons?

519
00:33:38,708 --> 00:33:40,708
Your father's daughter,
indeed.

520
00:33:40,708 --> 00:33:42,041
Give me a fortnight.

521
00:33:42,041 --> 00:33:44,249
Stay in King's Landing
as my honored guest.

522
00:33:44,249 --> 00:33:45,666
And when you
return to Braavos,

523
00:33:45,666 --> 00:33:50,124
I swear to you, my debt
will be paid in full.

524
00:34:13,750 --> 00:34:17,583
I came down here to brood over my
failure to predict the Greyjoy attack.

525
00:34:20,124 --> 00:34:21,666
You're making it
difficult.

526
00:34:21,666 --> 00:34:25,332
You look a lot better
brooding than I do.

527
00:34:27,041 --> 00:34:29,583
You make me feel like I'm failing
at brooding over failing.

528
00:34:29,583 --> 00:34:31,291
I'm a prisoner
on this island.

529
00:34:31,291 --> 00:34:35,249
I wouldn't say you're
a prisoner on this island.

530
00:34:35,249 --> 00:34:36,750
You're free
to walk the castle,

531
00:34:36,750 --> 00:34:38,666
the beaches,
to go wherever you want.

532
00:34:38,666 --> 00:34:40,833
Except to my ship.

533
00:34:40,833 --> 00:34:42,249
You took my ship.

534
00:34:42,249 --> 00:34:44,207
I wouldn't say
we took your ship.

535
00:34:44,207 --> 00:34:46,708
I'm not playing
word games with you.

536
00:34:46,708 --> 00:34:48,583
The dead are coming
for us all.

537
00:34:48,583 --> 00:34:50,249
Why don't you
figure out what to do

538
00:34:50,249 --> 00:34:52,332
about my missing fleet
and murdered allies,

539
00:34:52,332 --> 00:34:55,207
and I'll figure out what to do
about your walking dead men.

540
00:34:55,207 --> 00:34:57,416
It's hard for me to fathom.
It really is.

541
00:34:57,416 --> 00:35:00,541
If someone told me about the white
walkers and the Night King...

542
00:35:07,958 --> 00:35:09,207
You probably
don't believe me.

543
00:35:11,666 --> 00:35:13,833
I do, actually.

544
00:35:13,833 --> 00:35:15,374
You didn't before.

545
00:35:17,082 --> 00:35:19,291
"Grumkins and snarks,"
you called them.

546
00:35:19,291 --> 00:35:21,374
Do you remember?

547
00:35:21,374 --> 00:35:23,458
You said
it was all nonsense.

548
00:35:23,458 --> 00:35:26,583
It was nonsense.
Everybody knew it.

549
00:35:26,583 --> 00:35:29,708
But then Mormont
saw them

550
00:35:29,708 --> 00:35:31,124
and you saw them.

551
00:35:31,124 --> 00:35:32,791
And I trust the eyes
of an honest man

552
00:35:32,791 --> 00:35:34,791
more than I trust
what everybody knows.

553
00:35:36,124 --> 00:35:38,374
How do I convince people
who don't know me

554
00:35:38,374 --> 00:35:41,124
that an enemy they don't believe
in is coming to kill them all?

555
00:35:41,124 --> 00:35:44,458
- Good question.
- I know it's a good question.

556
00:35:44,458 --> 00:35:46,624
I'm looking
for an answer.

557
00:35:46,624 --> 00:35:50,916
People's minds aren't made
for problems that large.

558
00:35:50,916 --> 00:35:53,374
White walkers,
the Night King,

559
00:35:53,374 --> 00:35:55,458
Army of the Dead--

560
00:35:55,458 --> 00:35:57,082
it's almost a relief
to confront

561
00:35:57,082 --> 00:35:59,958
a comfortable, familiar
monster like my sister.

562
00:36:02,291 --> 00:36:05,249
I need to help prepare my
people for what's coming.

563
00:36:06,958 --> 00:36:09,291
I can't help them
from here.

564
00:36:10,791 --> 00:36:12,041
I'd like to leave.

565
00:36:13,499 --> 00:36:16,000
It seems unlikely that
you became King in the North

566
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,666
by giving up
that easily.

567
00:36:19,833 --> 00:36:22,958
Everyone told me to learn
from my father's mistakes.

568
00:36:22,958 --> 00:36:24,750
Don't go south.

569
00:36:24,750 --> 00:36:27,416
Don't answer a summons
from the Mad King's daughter,

570
00:36:27,416 --> 00:36:28,833
a foreign invader.

571
00:36:31,207 --> 00:36:33,916
And here I am,

572
00:36:33,916 --> 00:36:35,458
a Northern fool.

573
00:36:35,458 --> 00:36:37,916
Children are not
their fathers,

574
00:36:37,916 --> 00:36:39,624
luckily
for all of us.

575
00:36:41,124 --> 00:36:43,332
And sometimes there's more
to foreign invaders

576
00:36:43,332 --> 00:36:45,541
and Northern fools
than meets the eye.

577
00:36:45,541 --> 00:36:49,750
Daenerys could have sailed for
Westeros long ago, but she didn't.

578
00:36:49,750 --> 00:36:51,583
Instead, she stayed
where she was

579
00:36:51,583 --> 00:36:54,249
and saved many people
from horrible fates,

580
00:36:54,249 --> 00:36:56,583
some of whom are on this
island with us right now.

581
00:36:56,583 --> 00:36:58,166
While you're
our guest here,

582
00:36:58,166 --> 00:36:59,708
you might consider
asking them

583
00:36:59,708 --> 00:37:02,458
what they think
of the Mad King's daughter.

584
00:37:02,458 --> 00:37:05,541
She protects people
from monsters,

585
00:37:05,541 --> 00:37:07,082
just as you do.

586
00:37:07,082 --> 00:37:09,541
It's why she came here.

587
00:37:09,541 --> 00:37:11,082
And she's not about
to head north

588
00:37:11,082 --> 00:37:12,541
to fight an enemy
she's never seen

589
00:37:12,541 --> 00:37:15,041
on the word of a man
she doesn't know.

590
00:37:15,041 --> 00:37:17,458
After a single meeting,

591
00:37:17,458 --> 00:37:20,249
it's not a reasonable
thing to ask.

592
00:37:26,624 --> 00:37:28,875
So, do you have anything
reasonable to ask?

593
00:37:33,708 --> 00:37:34,875
What do you mean?

594
00:37:34,875 --> 00:37:37,124
Maybe you are
a Northern fool.

595
00:37:37,124 --> 00:37:40,791
I'm asking if there's something
I can do to help you.

596
00:37:43,750 --> 00:37:45,291
- Dragonglass?
- Tyrion: Yes.

597
00:37:45,291 --> 00:37:47,750
Volcanic glass,
obsidian.

598
00:37:47,750 --> 00:37:49,750
He says you have a tremendous
amount of it here.

599
00:37:49,750 --> 00:37:51,541
Why are we talking
about glass?

600
00:37:51,541 --> 00:37:53,416
We just lost
two of our allies.

601
00:37:53,416 --> 00:37:56,791
Which is why I was speaking to
Jon Snow, a potential ally.

602
00:37:59,166 --> 00:38:02,916
And what does the King in the
North want with dragonglass?

603
00:38:02,916 --> 00:38:05,249
Apparently, it can be
turned into weapons

604
00:38:05,249 --> 00:38:08,374
that kill white walkers
and their foot soldiers.

605
00:38:08,374 --> 00:38:10,541
Or stop them.

606
00:38:10,541 --> 00:38:11,833
Destroy them.

607
00:38:11,833 --> 00:38:13,458
Unsure about
the nomenclature.

608
00:38:15,416 --> 00:38:18,374
And what do you think
about this Army of the Dead

609
00:38:18,374 --> 00:38:21,249
and white walkers
and Night Kings?

610
00:38:21,249 --> 00:38:23,875
I'd very much like to believe
that Jon Snow is wrong.

611
00:38:23,875 --> 00:38:27,124
But a wise man once said that you
should never believe a thing

612
00:38:27,124 --> 00:38:29,666
simply because
you want to believe it.

613
00:38:32,374 --> 00:38:35,541
Which wise man
said this?

614
00:38:35,541 --> 00:38:37,416
I don't remember.

615
00:38:37,416 --> 00:38:40,833
Are you trying to present your own
statements as ancient wisdom?

616
00:38:42,041 --> 00:38:44,249
I would never do that.

617
00:38:44,249 --> 00:38:45,291
To you.

618
00:38:47,124 --> 00:38:50,791
The reason I believe Jon
Snow is because he's here.

619
00:38:50,791 --> 00:38:53,207
All of his advisors would
have told him not to come.

620
00:38:53,207 --> 00:38:55,291
I would have told him
not to come.

621
00:38:55,291 --> 00:38:57,624
And he's here anyway.

622
00:38:57,624 --> 00:39:00,041
You don't
have to believe him.

623
00:39:00,041 --> 00:39:02,082
Let him mine
the dragonglass.

624
00:39:02,082 --> 00:39:03,708
If he's wrong,
it's worthless.

625
00:39:03,708 --> 00:39:05,791
You didn't even know
it was here.

626
00:39:05,791 --> 00:39:08,332
It's nothing to you.

627
00:39:08,332 --> 00:39:11,624
Give him something
by giving him nothing.

628
00:39:11,624 --> 00:39:14,332
Take a step toward a more
productive relationship

629
00:39:14,332 --> 00:39:16,916
with a possible ally.

630
00:39:16,916 --> 00:39:20,291
Keep him occupied while we
focus on the task at hand--

631
00:39:20,291 --> 00:39:21,666
Casterly Rock.

632
00:39:22,916 --> 00:39:24,708
What was that
Ser Davos said

633
00:39:24,708 --> 00:39:28,750
about taking a knife in
the heart for his people?

634
00:39:28,750 --> 00:39:30,541
Did you notice that?

635
00:39:30,541 --> 00:39:33,000
You must allow them
their flights of fancy.

636
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,166
It's dreary
in the North.

637
00:39:37,750 --> 00:39:40,666
( screeching )

638
00:39:51,041 --> 00:39:52,541
Amazing thing
to see.

639
00:39:54,041 --> 00:39:57,082
I named them for my brothers,
Viserys and Rhaegar.

640
00:39:58,207 --> 00:39:59,708
They're both gone now.

641
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,374
You lost
two brothers as well.

642
00:40:06,541 --> 00:40:09,416
People thought dragons were gone
forever, but here they are.

643
00:40:11,166 --> 00:40:14,000
Perhaps we should all be
examining what we think we know.

644
00:40:19,958 --> 00:40:22,249
You've been talking
to Tyrion.

645
00:40:22,249 --> 00:40:25,000
He is my Hand.

646
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,624
- He enjoys talking.
- We all enjoy what we're good at.

647
00:40:29,082 --> 00:40:30,583
I don't.

648
00:40:35,583 --> 00:40:38,583
You know I'm not going to let
Cersei stay on the Iron Throne.

649
00:40:38,583 --> 00:40:39,750
I never expected
that you would.

650
00:40:39,750 --> 00:40:41,000
And I haven't
changed my mind

651
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,082
about which kingdoms
belong to that throne.

652
00:40:43,082 --> 00:40:44,916
I haven't either.

653
00:40:49,458 --> 00:40:50,374
( sighs )

654
00:40:54,249 --> 00:40:58,458
I will allow you to mine the
dragonglass and forge weapons from it.

655
00:40:58,458 --> 00:41:01,458
Any resources or men you need,
I will provide for you.

656
00:41:04,958 --> 00:41:05,833
Thank you.

657
00:41:12,458 --> 00:41:16,124
So you believe me, then, about the
Night King and the Army of the Dead?

658
00:41:19,291 --> 00:41:22,000
You'd better
get to work, Jon Snow.

659
00:41:32,124 --> 00:41:34,000
( chatter )

660
00:41:46,666 --> 00:41:48,291
How much do we have?

661
00:41:48,291 --> 00:41:50,374
4,000 bushels,
my lady.

662
00:41:50,374 --> 00:41:51,541
What does
that mean?

663
00:41:51,541 --> 00:41:53,624
For the current
occupants of the castle,

664
00:41:53,624 --> 00:41:57,291
it's enough food
for a year, perhaps more.

665
00:41:57,291 --> 00:42:00,708
And what's the longest winter
in the past hundred years?

666
00:42:00,708 --> 00:42:03,166
Uh, I'm not
entirely certain.

667
00:42:03,166 --> 00:42:05,000
I-I'll check
Maester Luwin's records.

668
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:08,499
He kept a copy
of every raven scroll.

669
00:42:08,499 --> 00:42:10,624
You're telling me
we don't have enough food,

670
00:42:10,624 --> 00:42:13,833
especially not if the armies of the
North come back to defend Winterfell?

671
00:42:15,082 --> 00:42:17,332
No, my lady,
most likely not.

672
00:42:17,332 --> 00:42:19,458
Then we must prepare
for that eventuality.

673
00:42:19,458 --> 00:42:21,541
Whatever direction
the threat comes from,

674
00:42:21,541 --> 00:42:23,833
this is
the best place to be.

675
00:42:23,833 --> 00:42:25,791
We need to start
building up our grain stores

676
00:42:25,791 --> 00:42:28,374
with regular shipments
from every keep in the North.

677
00:42:28,374 --> 00:42:30,666
If we don't use it by winter's
end, we'll give it back to them.

678
00:42:30,666 --> 00:42:33,000
But if the entire North
has to flee to Winterfell,

679
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:36,708
they won't have enough time to bring
wagonloads of grain with them.

680
00:42:36,708 --> 00:42:38,124
Very wise, my lady.

681
00:42:38,124 --> 00:42:39,916
Maester Wolkan,
you'll see to it?

682
00:42:43,708 --> 00:42:46,207
Are they covering those
breastplates in leather?

683
00:42:46,207 --> 00:42:47,583
No, my lady.

684
00:42:47,583 --> 00:42:50,666
Well, shouldn't they be?
Once the real cold comes?

685
00:42:50,666 --> 00:42:52,082
They should, indeed.

686
00:42:52,082 --> 00:42:54,291
Pardon me, my lady.

687
00:42:54,291 --> 00:42:56,875
You there, why isn't
there leather on these?

688
00:42:58,875 --> 00:43:00,666
Command suits you.

689
00:43:02,374 --> 00:43:04,458
The Northerners
are all facing north,

690
00:43:04,458 --> 00:43:06,541
worried about the threat
from beyond the Wall.

691
00:43:06,541 --> 00:43:08,082
So they should be.

692
00:43:08,082 --> 00:43:10,750
I know Cersei
better than anyone here.

693
00:43:10,750 --> 00:43:12,833
If you turn
your back on her--

694
00:43:12,833 --> 00:43:16,750
- You don't know Cersei better than
anyone here. - I only meant to say--

695
00:43:16,750 --> 00:43:20,291
That the woman who murdered my mother,
father, and brother is dangerous?

696
00:43:20,291 --> 00:43:22,374
Thank you for
your wise counsel.

697
00:43:23,666 --> 00:43:25,875
One of two things
will happen--

698
00:43:25,875 --> 00:43:28,166
either the dead
will defeat the living,

699
00:43:28,166 --> 00:43:30,124
in which case...

700
00:43:30,124 --> 00:43:32,207
all our troubles
come to an end,

701
00:43:32,207 --> 00:43:34,583
or life will win out.

702
00:43:34,583 --> 00:43:36,583
And what then?

703
00:43:36,583 --> 00:43:40,583
Don't fight in the
North or the South.

704
00:43:42,166 --> 00:43:47,041
Fight every battle, everywhere,
always, in your mind.

705
00:43:48,958 --> 00:43:50,833
Everyone is your enemy,

706
00:43:50,833 --> 00:43:53,750
everyone
is your friend...

707
00:43:53,750 --> 00:43:57,875
every possible series of events
is happening all at once.

708
00:43:57,875 --> 00:44:01,458
Live that way and nothing
will surprise you.

709
00:44:01,458 --> 00:44:04,041
Everything that happens
will be something

710
00:44:04,041 --> 00:44:05,958
that you've seen before.

711
00:44:08,207 --> 00:44:10,958
Lady Sansa,
at the gate.

712
00:44:19,791 --> 00:44:21,249
( people murmuring )

713
00:44:43,499 --> 00:44:44,666
Hello, Sansa.

714
00:44:51,958 --> 00:44:53,833
( sobbing )

715
00:45:05,541 --> 00:45:07,666
I wish Jon were here.

716
00:45:07,666 --> 00:45:10,541
Yes, I need
to speak to him.

717
00:45:14,708 --> 00:45:17,332
You're Father's
last living trueborn son.

718
00:45:19,166 --> 00:45:22,041
You're Lord
of Winterfell now.

719
00:45:22,041 --> 00:45:25,291
I can never be
Lord of Winterfell.

720
00:45:25,291 --> 00:45:27,124
I can never be
lord of anything.

721
00:45:27,124 --> 00:45:28,374
I'm the Three-Eyed Raven.

722
00:45:30,458 --> 00:45:32,249
I don't know
what that means.

723
00:45:32,249 --> 00:45:34,666
It's difficult
to explain.

724
00:45:34,666 --> 00:45:36,875
Try.
Please, for me.

725
00:45:38,583 --> 00:45:41,541
It means I can see
everything.

726
00:45:41,541 --> 00:45:43,875
Everything that's ever
happened to everyone.

727
00:45:43,875 --> 00:45:46,875
Everything that's
happening right now.

728
00:45:46,875 --> 00:45:51,666
It's all pieces now,
fragments.

729
00:45:51,666 --> 00:45:53,875
I need to learn
to see better.

730
00:45:53,875 --> 00:45:57,291
When the Long Night
comes again,

731
00:45:57,291 --> 00:45:58,916
I need to be ready.

732
00:46:01,958 --> 00:46:04,374
How do you know
all this?

733
00:46:04,374 --> 00:46:05,916
The Three-Eyed Raven
taught me.

734
00:46:05,916 --> 00:46:07,833
I thought you were
the Three-Eyed Raven.

735
00:46:07,833 --> 00:46:10,583
I told you it's
difficult to explain.

736
00:46:10,583 --> 00:46:12,750
( sighs )

737
00:46:12,750 --> 00:46:14,249
Bran--

738
00:46:14,249 --> 00:46:16,624
I'm sorry for all
that's happened to you.

739
00:46:16,624 --> 00:46:20,624
I'm sorry it had to
happen here in our home.

740
00:46:25,833 --> 00:46:27,916
It was so beautiful
that night.

741
00:46:29,916 --> 00:46:33,916
Snow falling,
just like now.

742
00:46:37,166 --> 00:46:39,000
And you were
so beautiful...

743
00:46:40,958 --> 00:46:42,750
in your white
wedding dress.

744
00:46:46,624 --> 00:46:48,499
I have to go
back inside, Bran.

745
00:46:49,875 --> 00:46:51,583
I'll stay
a bit longer.

746
00:47:02,875 --> 00:47:05,291
( man coughing
in distance )

747
00:47:05,291 --> 00:47:06,833
Hmm.

748
00:47:15,332 --> 00:47:17,166
Hmm.

749
00:47:22,624 --> 00:47:24,499
Does it hurt?

750
00:47:24,499 --> 00:47:27,207
A bit.
Less than before.

751
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:31,624
The infection no longer
appears to be active.

752
00:47:31,624 --> 00:47:33,207
( sighs )

753
00:47:33,207 --> 00:47:35,041
Unusual.

754
00:47:35,041 --> 00:47:36,499
Unlikely.

755
00:47:36,499 --> 00:47:38,499
One could almost
be forgiven

756
00:47:38,499 --> 00:47:42,082
for thinking that the entire upper
layer of diseased skin was debrided

757
00:47:42,082 --> 00:47:46,458
and the underlying region treated
with some sort of unguent.

758
00:47:46,458 --> 00:47:49,750
Don't know
anything about that.

759
00:47:49,750 --> 00:47:51,833
I just started
feeling better.

760
00:47:51,833 --> 00:47:55,499
I assumed it was
the rest that did it.

761
00:47:57,458 --> 00:48:00,082
And the climate.

762
00:48:00,082 --> 00:48:02,041
The climate.

763
00:48:02,041 --> 00:48:03,833
You're free
to go, ser.

764
00:48:03,833 --> 00:48:05,875
This chamber is needed
for the infectious,

765
00:48:05,875 --> 00:48:07,583
which you are
no longer.

766
00:48:07,583 --> 00:48:11,082
Tarly, I'd like to speak with
you in my study this evening.

767
00:48:14,041 --> 00:48:15,332
How bad is it?

768
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:18,374
Suppose I'll find out
this evening.

769
00:48:23,499 --> 00:48:26,207
- Where will you go?
- ( grunts )

770
00:48:26,207 --> 00:48:29,916
I surrendered to this sickness
the moment I first saw it.

771
00:48:31,374 --> 00:48:34,207
I knew
it would kill me

772
00:48:34,207 --> 00:48:36,875
or I'd kill myself
before it could.

773
00:48:36,875 --> 00:48:40,124
Daenerys Stormborn
convinced me otherwise.

774
00:48:40,124 --> 00:48:43,750
The only place for me
is back with her.

775
00:48:43,750 --> 00:48:46,166
I owe her my life.

776
00:48:46,166 --> 00:48:48,750
Her and you.

777
00:48:48,750 --> 00:48:50,958
( chuckles )

778
00:48:50,958 --> 00:48:53,291
Your father saved me
more than once.

779
00:48:53,291 --> 00:48:55,082
It's the least
I could do.

780
00:48:56,583 --> 00:48:59,958
Perhaps our paths
will cross again.

781
00:48:59,958 --> 00:49:01,374
I hope they do.

782
00:49:28,499 --> 00:49:31,958
- Ebrose: You treated him?
- Yes.

783
00:49:31,958 --> 00:49:34,458
Who told you
to treat him?

784
00:49:34,458 --> 00:49:35,791
No one.

785
00:49:35,791 --> 00:49:39,082
Who forbade you, or anyone,
to attempt to treat him?

786
00:49:39,082 --> 00:49:41,791
I seem
to remember you.

787
00:49:41,791 --> 00:49:44,624
- But you treated him anyway?
- I did, yes.

788
00:49:46,291 --> 00:49:49,416
I forbade it because it is
dangerous and rarely successful,

789
00:49:49,416 --> 00:49:51,750
especially on
someone of that age.

790
00:49:51,750 --> 00:49:53,958
You could have infected
yourself and others.

791
00:49:53,958 --> 00:49:57,416
You could have devastated
the entire Citadel.

792
00:49:59,708 --> 00:50:01,624
But you didn't.

793
00:50:01,624 --> 00:50:04,249
It's a meticulous,
difficult procedure.

794
00:50:04,249 --> 00:50:07,666
Many maesters whose chains
are heavy with healing links

795
00:50:07,666 --> 00:50:10,124
have attempted it
and failed.

796
00:50:10,124 --> 00:50:12,207
Yet you succeeded.

797
00:50:12,207 --> 00:50:13,332
How?

798
00:50:15,332 --> 00:50:18,624
I read the books
and followed the instructions.

799
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:31,207
That man is alive
because of you.

800
00:50:33,499 --> 00:50:35,124
You should be proud.

801
00:50:38,207 --> 00:50:40,708
Thank you,
Archmaester.

802
00:50:40,708 --> 00:50:41,624
Come here.

803
00:50:45,666 --> 00:50:49,332
All these manuscripts
and scrolls are rotting away.

804
00:50:49,332 --> 00:50:52,000
I need you
to make copies of them.

805
00:50:56,291 --> 00:50:58,374
You were expecting
a reward.

806
00:51:00,082 --> 00:51:03,875
Your reward is not being immediately
expelled from the Citadel.

807
00:51:05,041 --> 00:51:07,041
You'd better
get started.

808
00:51:07,041 --> 00:51:08,708
And careful
of the paper mites.

809
00:51:08,708 --> 00:51:10,041
They like flesh
as well.

810
00:51:17,291 --> 00:51:20,666
We need to find Euron
Greyjoy's fleet and sink it.

811
00:51:20,666 --> 00:51:24,166
Your Grace, he's already destroyed
a good portion of our fleet.

812
00:51:24,166 --> 00:51:25,708
To send our remaining
ships after him--

813
00:51:25,708 --> 00:51:28,374
I'm not talking about
sending our ships after him.

814
00:51:32,207 --> 00:51:33,750
Would you have to go
yourself?

815
00:51:33,750 --> 00:51:35,750
Euron's ships
could be anywhere

816
00:51:35,750 --> 00:51:37,750
or in more than
one place.

817
00:51:37,750 --> 00:51:40,166
You'd be flying around
the open seas alone

818
00:51:40,166 --> 00:51:41,207
for who knows
how long.

819
00:51:41,207 --> 00:51:42,833
I wouldn't be alone.

820
00:51:42,833 --> 00:51:45,416
I would have Drogon,
Viserion, and Rhaegal.

821
00:51:45,416 --> 00:51:47,207
What can anyone
do to them?

822
00:51:47,207 --> 00:51:49,207
Missandei: They can still
do something to you.

823
00:51:49,207 --> 00:51:51,000
It only takes
one arrow.

824
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:53,541
It's too great a risk.
You're too important.

825
00:51:55,875 --> 00:51:58,000
What about
Casterly Rock?

826
00:51:58,000 --> 00:51:59,958
The Unsullied
will be there soon.

827
00:51:59,958 --> 00:52:02,541
And what will they face?

828
00:52:02,541 --> 00:52:04,958
A difficult situation.

829
00:52:04,958 --> 00:52:07,082
They know we're coming.

830
00:52:07,082 --> 00:52:10,416
Yes. Cersei believes
my sole purpose in life

831
00:52:10,416 --> 00:52:12,041
is to destroy
House Lannister.

832
00:52:12,041 --> 00:52:13,791
She will be ready.

833
00:52:17,791 --> 00:52:20,416
- No one has ever taken the Rock.
- Man: Archers!

834
00:52:20,416 --> 00:52:22,791
Tyrion: The Lannister Army is
still the army my father built.

835
00:52:22,791 --> 00:52:25,124
- Come on! - Tyrion: Well-trained
and well-provisioned.

836
00:52:25,124 --> 00:52:26,916
10,000 men at least.

837
00:52:26,916 --> 00:52:27,833
They will see us coming.

838
00:52:32,458 --> 00:52:34,124
They will be ready.

839
00:52:34,124 --> 00:52:37,416
( men shouting )

840
00:52:37,416 --> 00:52:39,458
- Man: Draw! Loose!
- Man #2: Loose!

841
00:52:41,666 --> 00:52:44,791
Tyrion: The gates of Casterly
Rock are impregnable.

842
00:52:45,875 --> 00:52:48,000
( men grunting )

843
00:52:52,499 --> 00:52:54,750
The fight up the walls
will be hard.

844
00:52:54,750 --> 00:52:56,291
We will be
at a disadvantage.

845
00:52:57,666 --> 00:52:59,332
- ( grunts )
- Many men will die.

846
00:53:01,499 --> 00:53:03,541
Just as my father
said they would.

847
00:53:05,708 --> 00:53:08,332
Interesting thing
about my father--

848
00:53:08,332 --> 00:53:10,249
he built our house up
from near ruin.

849
00:53:10,249 --> 00:53:14,416
He built our army, he built
Casterly Rock as we know it,

850
00:53:14,416 --> 00:53:16,499
but he didn't
build the sewers.

851
00:53:16,499 --> 00:53:18,583
That was beneath him,

852
00:53:18,583 --> 00:53:21,458
so he gave the job to the
lowest person he could find--

853
00:53:21,458 --> 00:53:23,000
me.

854
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:24,833
He was right,
I was low.

855
00:53:24,833 --> 00:53:26,958
The company I kept, low.

856
00:53:26,958 --> 00:53:28,499
Women, mostly.

857
00:53:28,499 --> 00:53:30,166
They weren't welcome
at the Rock.

858
00:53:30,166 --> 00:53:32,458
Father disapproved
of that sort of behavior.

859
00:53:32,458 --> 00:53:34,082
Couldn't walk them
through the front gates,

860
00:53:34,082 --> 00:53:35,541
I couldn't have them
in my chambers,

861
00:53:35,541 --> 00:53:37,791
so in the process
of building the sewers,

862
00:53:37,791 --> 00:53:40,541
I threw in something
for myself.

863
00:53:42,583 --> 00:53:44,583
It was a passage
that began

864
00:53:44,583 --> 00:53:46,291
in an out of the way cove
by the sea

865
00:53:46,291 --> 00:53:49,708
and ended beneath
one of the main guard towers.

866
00:53:49,708 --> 00:53:52,916
No better place for low pursuits
than beneath the ground.

867
00:53:54,541 --> 00:53:58,291
Casterly Rock
is an impregnable fortress.

868
00:53:58,291 --> 00:54:00,541
( grunts, wheezes )

869
00:54:00,541 --> 00:54:04,207
But as a good friend of mine
once said,

870
00:54:04,207 --> 00:54:08,166
"Give me 10 good men
and I'll impregnate the bitch."

871
00:54:08,166 --> 00:54:10,708
- ( grunting )
- ( all shouting )

872
00:54:13,708 --> 00:54:14,916
And so it begins.

873
00:54:21,666 --> 00:54:24,541
They will face the bulk
of the Lannister forces.

874
00:54:24,541 --> 00:54:26,416
They will be outnumbered.

875
00:54:26,416 --> 00:54:28,750
They will have less armor
and fewer weapons.

876
00:54:33,708 --> 00:54:37,499
But my sister's armies
fight for her out of fear.

877
00:54:37,499 --> 00:54:40,458
The Unsullied will be fighting
for something greater.

878
00:54:40,458 --> 00:54:42,458
They will be fighting
for freedom

879
00:54:42,458 --> 00:54:44,249
and the person
who gave it to them.

880
00:54:44,249 --> 00:54:46,750
They will be fighting
for you.

881
00:54:46,750 --> 00:54:49,207
And that is why
they will triumph.

882
00:55:05,207 --> 00:55:06,958
( speaking Valyrian )

883
00:55:08,416 --> 00:55:10,624
( Grey Worm speaking
Valyrian )

884
00:55:14,666 --> 00:55:17,624
( distant explosions )

885
00:55:35,958 --> 00:55:37,166
Where are they?!

886
00:55:37,166 --> 00:55:39,791
Where are the rest
of the Lannisters?

887
00:56:09,791 --> 00:56:12,833
( men shouting )

888
00:56:34,708 --> 00:56:36,249
( chatter )

889
00:57:02,416 --> 00:57:04,624
( door opens )

890
00:57:08,666 --> 00:57:10,916
- It's done.
- It is.

891
00:57:12,791 --> 00:57:16,916
And now the rains weep
o'er our halls.

892
00:57:19,249 --> 00:57:20,708
Did we fight well?

893
00:57:20,708 --> 00:57:23,750
Uh, as well
as could be expected.

894
00:57:23,750 --> 00:57:25,875
It was never our forte.

895
00:57:25,875 --> 00:57:27,958
Golden roses, indeed.

896
00:57:29,875 --> 00:57:31,916
Your brother
and his new queen

897
00:57:31,916 --> 00:57:34,833
thought you would be
defending Casterly Rock.

898
00:57:34,833 --> 00:57:38,124
The truth is Casterly Rock
isn't worth much anymore.

899
00:57:38,124 --> 00:57:39,708
Well, it is to me,

900
00:57:39,708 --> 00:57:42,041
but my fond
childhood memories

901
00:57:42,041 --> 00:57:43,583
won't keep Cersei
on the throne.

902
00:57:43,583 --> 00:57:45,708
So you just
let them take it?

903
00:57:45,708 --> 00:57:47,750
For now. They won't
be able to hold it.

904
00:57:47,750 --> 00:57:50,291
Euron Greyjoy's navy
burned their ships,

905
00:57:50,291 --> 00:57:52,291
we emptied the larders
before we left.

906
00:57:52,291 --> 00:57:54,541
Eventually, they'll be forced
to abandon their position

907
00:57:54,541 --> 00:57:57,958
and march all the way
across Westeros.

908
00:57:57,958 --> 00:58:01,124
And you took your army,
your real army,

909
00:58:01,124 --> 00:58:03,000
and went
where they weren't.

910
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:06,332
As Robb Stark did to me
at Whispering Wood.

911
00:58:06,332 --> 00:58:08,374
There are always
lessons in failures.

912
00:58:08,374 --> 00:58:11,958
Yes. You must be
very wise by now.

913
00:58:13,249 --> 00:58:16,124
My father always said
I was a slow learner.

914
00:58:16,124 --> 00:58:17,875
If he was so clever,

915
00:58:17,875 --> 00:58:19,624
why didn't he take
Highgarden

916
00:58:19,624 --> 00:58:23,332
the moment your
gold mines ran dry?

917
00:58:23,332 --> 00:58:24,875
( scoffs )

918
00:58:24,875 --> 00:58:28,791
I suppose I'll be able to
ask him myself soon enough.

919
00:58:28,791 --> 00:58:31,875
No more learning
from my mistakes, eh?

920
00:58:34,332 --> 00:58:36,833
How will you do it?

921
00:58:36,833 --> 00:58:39,291
With that sword?

922
00:58:39,291 --> 00:58:41,666
That was Joffrey's sword,
wasn't it?

923
00:58:41,666 --> 00:58:44,000
Not that
he ever used it.

924
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:45,666
What did he call it?

925
00:58:47,291 --> 00:58:49,624
Widow's Wail.

926
00:58:49,624 --> 00:58:51,833
He really was a cunt,
wasn't he?

927
00:58:53,458 --> 00:58:58,833
I did unspeakable things
to protect my family.

928
00:58:58,833 --> 00:59:02,875
Or watched them
being done on my orders.

929
00:59:02,875 --> 00:59:06,041
I never lost
a night's sleep over them.

930
00:59:06,041 --> 00:59:08,082
They were necessary.

931
00:59:08,082 --> 00:59:10,124
And whatever
I imagined necessary

932
00:59:10,124 --> 00:59:14,041
for the safety
of House Tyrell, I did.

933
00:59:14,041 --> 00:59:18,666
But your sister
has done things...

934
00:59:20,332 --> 00:59:22,666
I was incapable
of imagining.

935
00:59:22,666 --> 00:59:25,499
That was
my prize mistake--

936
00:59:25,499 --> 00:59:28,041
a failure
of imagination.

937
00:59:29,374 --> 00:59:31,833
She's a monster,
you do know that?

938
00:59:31,833 --> 00:59:34,000
To you, I'm sure.

939
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:35,875
To others as well.

940
00:59:35,875 --> 00:59:39,374
But after we've won and there's
no one left to oppose us,

941
00:59:39,374 --> 00:59:43,708
when people are living peacefully
in the world she built,

942
00:59:43,708 --> 00:59:47,416
do you really think they'll wring their
hands over the way she built it?

943
00:59:49,833 --> 00:59:52,041
You love her.

944
00:59:52,041 --> 00:59:53,833
You really do
love her.

945
00:59:53,833 --> 00:59:56,291
You poor fool.

946
00:59:56,291 --> 00:59:58,041
She'll be
the end of you.

947
00:59:58,041 --> 01:00:00,583
Possibly.

948
01:00:00,583 --> 01:00:02,374
Not much
to be gained

949
01:00:02,374 --> 01:00:04,416
from discussing it with
you, though, is there?

950
01:00:04,416 --> 01:00:07,124
What better person
to discuss it with?

951
01:00:07,124 --> 01:00:09,041
What better guarantee
could you have

952
01:00:09,041 --> 01:00:13,082
that the things you say
will never leave this room?

953
01:00:13,082 --> 01:00:16,124
But perhaps
you're right.

954
01:00:16,124 --> 01:00:17,708
If she's driven you
this far,

955
01:00:17,708 --> 01:00:20,124
it's gone beyond
your control.

956
01:00:21,416 --> 01:00:23,416
Yes.

957
01:00:23,416 --> 01:00:24,875
It has.

958
01:00:25,958 --> 01:00:28,000
She's a disease.

959
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:30,958
I regret my role
in spreading it.

960
01:00:30,958 --> 01:00:32,541
You will, too.

961
01:00:32,541 --> 01:00:34,291
I think
we're done here.

962
01:00:37,708 --> 01:00:38,750
How will it happen?

963
01:00:40,291 --> 01:00:42,207
Cersei had
several ideas.

964
01:00:42,207 --> 01:00:43,624
Whipping you
through the streets

965
01:00:43,624 --> 01:00:46,291
and beheading you
in front of the Red Keep.

966
01:00:46,291 --> 01:00:50,124
Flaying you alive and hanging you
from the walls of King's Landing.

967
01:00:53,291 --> 01:00:55,082
I talked her
out of those.

968
01:01:12,332 --> 01:01:13,750
Will there be pain?

969
01:01:13,750 --> 01:01:16,332
No. I made sure
of that.

970
01:01:16,332 --> 01:01:17,666
That's good.

971
01:01:30,458 --> 01:01:32,458
I'd hate to die
like your son.

972
01:01:33,666 --> 01:01:35,124
Clawing at my neck,

973
01:01:35,124 --> 01:01:38,000
foam and bile spilling
from my mouth,

974
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:41,833
eyes bloodred,
skin purple.

975
01:01:41,833 --> 01:01:44,207
Must have been
horrible for you,

976
01:01:44,207 --> 01:01:47,666
as a Kingsguard,
as a father.

977
01:01:47,666 --> 01:01:50,249
It was horrible
enough for me.

978
01:01:50,249 --> 01:01:52,916
A shocking scene.

979
01:01:52,916 --> 01:01:55,708
Not at all
what I intended.

980
01:01:57,666 --> 01:02:02,249
You see, I had never seen
the poison work before.

981
01:02:07,207 --> 01:02:09,374
Tell Cersei.

982
01:02:09,374 --> 01:02:11,833
I want her to know
it was me.

983
01:02:35,249 --> 01:02:38,082
( music playing )

984
01:03:56,124 --> 01:03:57,666
My only venture at this moment

985
01:03:57,666 --> 01:04:00,291
is reestablishing control
over this continent

986
01:04:00,291 --> 01:04:01,833
and every person on it.

987
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:05,499
DAENERYS TARGARYEN:
All my allies are gone.

988
01:04:05,499 --> 01:04:06,332
I'm losing.

989
01:04:07,082 --> 01:04:10,207
You can count on the Iron Bank.
As soon as the gold arrives.

990
01:04:10,916 --> 01:04:12,791
Enough with the clever plans.
