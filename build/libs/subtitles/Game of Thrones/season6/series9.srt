00:01:54,853 --> 00:01:57,586

<i>( man #2 shouts

( men screaming )

00:02:27,416 --> 00:02:30,149
<i>( explosions )</i>

9
00:02:30,251 --> 00:02:33,152
Despite appearances, I think you'll
find the city's on the rise.

10
00:02:33,254 --> 00:02:36,122
<i>( explosions )</i>

11
00:02:36,224 --> 00:02:38,323
Perhaps we should
take shelter.

12
00:02:39,593 --> 00:02:41,626
The city's on the rise?

13
00:02:41,728 --> 00:02:43,495
Meereen is strong.

14
00:02:43,597 --> 00:02:45,463
Commerce has returned
to the markets.

15
00:02:45,565 --> 00:02:48,099
The people are behind you.

16
00:02:50,036 --> 00:02:51,902
Well, not all the people,
of course.

17
00:02:52,004 --> 00:02:55,072
No ruler that ever lived had
the support of all the people.

18
00:02:55,174 --> 00:02:59,509
<i>But the rebirth of Meereen is
the cause of this violence.</i>

19
00:03:00,779 --> 00:03:03,846
The Masters cannot
let Meereen succeed.

20
00:03:03,948 --> 00:03:07,150
Because if Meereen succeeds,
a city without slavery,

21
00:03:07,252 --> 00:03:10,452
a city without Masters...

22
00:03:10,554 --> 00:03:13,221
...it proves that
no one needs a Master.

23
00:03:16,093 --> 00:03:18,060
Good.

24
00:03:18,162 --> 00:03:20,027
Shall we begin?

25
00:03:21,564 --> 00:03:23,330
Do we have a plan?

26
00:03:23,433 --> 00:03:25,399
I will crucify the Masters.

27
00:03:25,501 --> 00:03:27,268
I will set
their fleets afire,

28
00:03:27,370 --> 00:03:29,170
kill every last one
of their soldiers,

29
00:03:29,271 --> 00:03:31,371
and return their cities
to the dirt.

30
00:03:31,473 --> 00:03:33,840
That is my plan.

31
00:03:35,277 --> 00:03:37,677
You don't approve?

32
00:03:37,779 --> 00:03:40,112
You once told me you knew
what your father was.

33
00:03:40,214 --> 00:03:42,848
Did you know his plans
for King's Landing

34
00:03:42,950 --> 00:03:45,317
when the Lannister armies
were at his gates?

35
00:03:45,419 --> 00:03:48,120
<i>( explosions )</i>

36
00:03:48,222 --> 00:03:50,621
Probably not.

37
00:03:50,724 --> 00:03:53,057
Well, he told my brother
and Jaime told me.

38
00:03:53,159 --> 00:03:56,794
<i>He had caches of wildfire
hidden under the Red Keep,</i>

39
00:03:56,896 --> 00:03:59,397
the Guildhalls,
the Sept of Baelor,

40
00:03:59,499 --> 00:04:01,498
all the major
thoroughfares.

41
00:04:03,235 --> 00:04:05,702
He would have burned
every one of his citizens.

42
00:04:05,804 --> 00:04:08,138
The loyal ones
and the traitors.

43
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:10,539
Every man,
woman, and child.

44
00:04:10,641 --> 00:04:12,074
That's why
Jaime killed him.

45
00:04:12,176 --> 00:04:13,442
This is entirely different.

46
00:04:13,544 --> 00:04:15,578
You're talking about
destroying cities.

47
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,780
It's not
entirely different.

48
00:04:21,585 --> 00:04:25,120
I'd like to suggest
an alternate approach.

49
00:04:38,701 --> 00:04:41,033
Once before,
I offered you peace.

50
00:04:41,136 --> 00:04:43,503
If you had not been
so arrogant,

51
00:04:43,605 --> 00:04:47,540
you could have returned to your
homeland with a fleet of ships.

52
00:04:49,577 --> 00:04:53,545
Instead, you will flee
Slaver's Bay on foot

53
00:04:53,647 --> 00:04:55,914
like the beggar queen
you are.

54
00:04:56,016 --> 00:04:59,084
<i>Tyrion: We are here to
discuss terms of surrender,</i>

55
00:04:59,186 --> 00:05:01,552
not to trade insults.

56
00:05:01,654 --> 00:05:03,554
The terms are simple.

57
00:05:03,656 --> 00:05:07,158
You and your foreign friends
will abandon the Great Pyramid

58
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:08,692
<i>and the city of Meereen.</i>

59
00:05:08,795 --> 00:05:11,294
<i>The Unsullied you stole
from Kraznys mo Nakloz</i>

60
00:05:11,396 --> 00:05:14,297
<i>will remain to be sold again
to the highest bidder.</i>

61
00:05:14,399 --> 00:05:17,433
<i>The translator you stole from
Kraznys mo Nakloz will remain</i>

62
00:05:17,536 --> 00:05:19,869
to be sold again
to the highest bidder.

63
00:05:19,971 --> 00:05:23,839
The dragons beneath the Great
Pyramid will be slaughtered.

64
00:05:25,376 --> 00:05:27,810
We obviously didn't
communicate clearly.

65
00:05:27,912 --> 00:05:30,779
We're here to discuss
your surrender, not mine.

66
00:05:34,384 --> 00:05:36,617
I imagine it's difficult

67
00:05:36,719 --> 00:05:39,287
adjusting
to the new reality.

68
00:05:41,691 --> 00:05:44,925
Your reign is over.

69
00:05:47,095 --> 00:05:50,330
My reign has just begun.

70

Dracarys.

89
00:09:33,099 --> 00:09:35,266
Thank you for the armada.

90
00:09:35,368 --> 00:09:37,134
<i>Our queen does love ships.</i>

91
00:09:37,236 --> 00:09:42,272
Now, last time we spoke,
we made a pact.

92
00:09:42,374 --> 00:09:44,474
You violated that pact.

93
00:09:44,576 --> 00:09:46,243
You declared war upon us.

94
00:09:46,344 --> 00:09:48,611
<i>Though our queen does have
a forgiving nature,</i>

95
00:09:48,713 --> 00:09:51,914
this cannot be forgiven.

96
00:09:52,016 --> 00:09:54,884
Our queen insists
that one of you must die

97
00:09:54,986 --> 00:09:57,385
<i>as punishment
for your crimes.</i>

98
00:09:58,855 --> 00:10:01,990
It always seems a bit
abstract, doesn't it,

99
00:10:02,092 --> 00:10:03,858
other people dying?

100
00:10:05,662 --> 00:10:07,728
Him.
He should die.

101
00:10:07,830 --> 00:10:10,097
<i>- Belicho: Yes, him.
- Razdal: He's not one of us.</i>

102
00:10:10,199 --> 00:10:11,765
<i>He's an outsider,
a lowborn.</i>

103
00:10:11,867 --> 00:10:13,867
<i>He does not speak for us.</i>

104
00:10:17,105 --> 00:10:19,005
Please.

105
00:10:20,642 --> 00:10:22,208
Please.

106
00:10:23,278 --> 00:10:24,744
( both groan )

107
00:10:40,927 --> 00:10:43,227
Tell your people
what happened here.

108
00:10:44,764 --> 00:10:48,064
Tell them you live
by the grace of Her Majesty.

109
00:10:48,166 --> 00:10:50,300
When they come forward
with notions of retribution

110
00:10:50,402 --> 00:10:54,804
or ideas about returning the slave
cities to their former glory,

111
00:10:54,906 --> 00:10:57,006
remind them what happened

112
00:10:57,109 --> 00:11:00,742
when Daenerys Stormborn and
her dragons came to Meereen.

113
00:11:02,746 --> 00:11:05,047
( dragons screeching )

114
00:11:15,492 --> 00:11:17,492
( horses whinnying )

115
00:11:35,776 --> 00:11:38,543
You don't have
to be here.

116
00:11:38,645 --> 00:11:40,678
Yes, I do.

117
00:12:05,470 --> 00:12:07,370
My beloved wife.

118
00:12:09,773 --> 00:12:11,806
I've missed you terribly.

119
00:12:15,212 --> 00:12:18,380
Thank you for returning
Lady Bolton safely.

120
00:12:18,482 --> 00:12:21,182
Now, dismount
and kneel before me,

121
00:12:21,284 --> 00:12:24,518
surrender your army and proclaim
me the true Lord of Winterfell

122
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:26,287
and Warden of the North.

123
00:12:26,389 --> 00:12:28,355
I will pardon you for
deserting the Night's Watch.

124
00:12:28,457 --> 00:12:32,458
I will pardon these treasonous
lords for betraying my house.

125
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:38,064
Come, bastard,

126
00:12:38,166 --> 00:12:40,966
you don't have the men,
you don't have the horses,

127
00:12:41,068 --> 00:12:43,268
<i>and you don't
have Winterfell.</i>

128
00:12:43,370 --> 00:12:47,005
<i>Why lead those poor souls
into slaughter?</i>

129
00:12:47,107 --> 00:12:49,807
There's no need
for a battle.

130
00:12:49,909 --> 00:12:52,843
Get off your horse
and kneel.

131
00:12:54,747 --> 00:12:56,547
I'm a man of mercy.

132
00:13:01,587 --> 00:13:03,253
You're right.

133
00:13:03,355 --> 00:13:05,488
There's no need
for a battle.

134
00:13:06,892 --> 00:13:09,659
Thousands of men
don't need to die.

135
00:13:11,696 --> 00:13:13,362
Only one of us.

136
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:17,733
Let's end this
the old way.

137
00:13:17,835 --> 00:13:19,902
You against me.

138
00:13:26,142 --> 00:13:29,177
( chuckling )

139
00:13:31,914 --> 00:13:35,182
I keep hearing stories
about you, bastard.

140
00:13:35,284 --> 00:13:37,417
The way people in the
North talk about you,

141
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:39,786
you're the greatest
swordsman who ever walked.

142
00:13:40,989 --> 00:13:43,289
Maybe you are that good.

143
00:13:43,391 --> 00:13:45,491
Maybe not.

144
00:13:45,593 --> 00:13:48,127
<i>I don't know
if I'd beat you.</i>

145
00:13:48,229 --> 00:13:51,396
But I know that my army
will beat yours.

146
00:13:51,498 --> 00:13:53,598
<i>I have 6,000 men.</i>

147
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:57,068
You have, what,
half that?

148
00:13:57,170 --> 00:13:58,570
Not even?

149
00:13:58,672 --> 00:14:00,705
Aye, you have
the numbers.

150
00:14:02,141 --> 00:14:03,641
Will your men
want to fight for you

151
00:14:03,743 --> 00:14:06,644
when they hear you
wouldn't fight for them?

152
00:14:14,753 --> 00:14:17,320
He's good.
Very good.

153
00:14:18,957 --> 00:14:21,357
Tell me, will you let
your little brother die

154
00:14:21,459 --> 00:14:23,659
because you're too proud
to surrender?

155
00:14:23,761 --> 00:14:25,727
How do we know
you have him?

156
00:14:51,253 --> 00:14:52,818
<i>Now, if you want
to save--</i>

157
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:55,487
You're going to die
tomorrow, Lord Bolton.

158
00:14:58,693 --> 00:15:00,492
Sleep well.

159
00:15:08,735 --> 00:15:11,602
She's a fine woman,
your sister.

160
00:15:11,705 --> 00:15:14,771
<i>I look forward to having
her back in my bed.</i>

161
00:15:18,243 --> 00:15:20,711
And you're all
fine-looking men.

162
00:15:20,813 --> 00:15:22,945
My dogs are desperate
to meet you.

163
00:15:23,047 --> 00:15:24,680
I haven't fed them
for seven days.

164
00:15:24,782 --> 00:15:26,115
They're ravenous.

165
00:15:26,217 --> 00:15:29,218
I wonder which parts
they'll try first.

166
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:31,721
<i>Your eyes?</i>

167
00:15:31,823 --> 00:15:33,288
Your balls?

168
00:15:35,292 --> 00:15:37,892
We'll find out
soon enough.

169
00:15:37,994 --> 00:15:42,330
In the morning,
then, bastard.

170
00:15:59,447 --> 00:16:01,514
<i>Jon: If he was smart,
he'd stay inside</i>

171
00:16:01,616 --> 00:16:03,382
<i>the walls of Winterfell
and wait us out.</i>

172
00:16:03,484 --> 00:16:06,418
That's not his way. He knows
the North is watching.

173
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:09,354
If the other houses
sense weakness on his part,

174
00:16:09,456 --> 00:16:11,189
they'll stop fearing him.

175
00:16:11,291 --> 00:16:13,958
He can't have that.
Fear is his power.

176
00:16:14,060 --> 00:16:16,627
It's his weakness, too. His men
don't want to fight for him.

177
00:16:16,729 --> 00:16:19,330
They're forced to fight for him.
If they feel the tide turning...

178
00:16:19,432 --> 00:16:21,766
It's not his men
that worry me.

179
00:16:21,868 --> 00:16:23,200
It's his horses.

180
00:16:23,302 --> 00:16:25,468
I know what mounted
knights can do to us.

181
00:16:25,570 --> 00:16:28,671
You and Stannis cut through us
like piss through snow.

182
00:16:28,774 --> 00:16:31,007
We're digging trenches
all along our flanks.

183
00:16:31,109 --> 00:16:33,343
They won't be able to hit us
the way that Stannis hit you,

184
00:16:33,445 --> 00:16:34,743
in a double envelopment.

185
00:16:38,783 --> 00:16:40,616
A pincer move.

186
00:16:45,555 --> 00:16:48,022
They won't be able
to hit us from the sides.

187
00:16:48,124 --> 00:16:50,024
Good.

188
00:16:52,429 --> 00:16:55,262
It's crucial that
we let them charge at us.

189
00:16:56,665 --> 00:16:59,266
They've got the numbers,
we need the patience.

190
00:17:02,104 --> 00:17:05,104
If we let him buckle
our center, he'll pursue.

191
00:17:05,206 --> 00:17:08,707
Then we'll have him
surrounded on three sides.

192
00:17:08,810 --> 00:17:12,578
Did you really think that cunt
would fight you man-to-man?

193
00:17:13,915 --> 00:17:15,213
No.

194
00:17:15,315 --> 00:17:17,215
But I wanted
to make him angry.

195
00:17:19,820 --> 00:17:22,253
I want him coming
at us full tilt.

196
00:17:24,090 --> 00:17:25,989
We should all
get some sleep.

197
00:17:26,091 --> 00:17:29,927
<i>Tormund: Rest, Jon Snow. We
need you sharp tomorrow.</i>

198
00:17:40,271 --> 00:17:42,738
So you've met the enemy,

199
00:17:42,841 --> 00:17:46,241
drawn up
your battle plans.

200
00:17:46,343 --> 00:17:49,277
Aye, for what
they're worth.

201
00:17:49,379 --> 00:17:53,248
You've known him for the space
of a single conversation,

202
00:17:53,350 --> 00:17:55,150
you and your
trusted advisors,

203
00:17:55,252 --> 00:17:56,817
<i>and you sit around
making your plans</i>

204
00:17:56,919 --> 00:17:59,787
<i>on how to defeat
a man you don't know.</i>

205
00:17:59,889 --> 00:18:01,422
<i>I lived with him.</i>

206
00:18:01,524 --> 00:18:03,123
I know the way
his mind works.

207
00:18:03,226 --> 00:18:06,326
I know how he likes
to hurt people.

208
00:18:06,428 --> 00:18:10,663
Did it ever once occur to you
that I might have some insight?

209
00:18:13,001 --> 00:18:14,767
You're right.

210
00:18:14,870 --> 00:18:17,536
You think he's going
to fall into your trap.

211
00:18:17,638 --> 00:18:19,905
He won't. He's the
one who lays traps.

212
00:18:20,007 --> 00:18:22,808
<i>- He's overconfident.
- He plays with people.</i>

213
00:18:22,910 --> 00:18:25,544
He's far better at it than you.
He's been doing it all his life.

214
00:18:25,646 --> 00:18:28,446
Aye, and what have I been doing all my life?
Playing with broomsticks?

215
00:18:28,548 --> 00:18:32,350
I fought beyond the Wall against
worse than Ramsay Bolton.

216
00:18:32,452 --> 00:18:35,219
I've defended the Wall
from worse than Ramsay Bolton.

217
00:18:35,321 --> 00:18:37,854
You don't know him.

218
00:18:39,124 --> 00:18:41,091
All right, tell me.

219
00:18:41,193 --> 00:18:44,027
What should we do?
How do we get Rickon back?

220
00:18:45,964 --> 00:18:47,730
We'll never get him back.

221
00:18:49,267 --> 00:18:52,167
Rickon is Ned Stark's
trueborn son,

222
00:18:52,270 --> 00:18:53,969
which makes him
a greater threat to Ramsay

223
00:18:54,071 --> 00:18:57,138
than you, a bastard,
or me, a girl.

224
00:18:57,240 --> 00:19:00,208
As long as he lives, Ramsay's claim
to Winterfell will be contested,

225
00:19:00,310 --> 00:19:03,778
which means
he won't live long.

226
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:06,247
We can't give up
on our brother.

227
00:19:06,349 --> 00:19:09,449
Listen to me, please. He
wants you to make a mistake.

228
00:19:09,552 --> 00:19:12,586
Of course he does. What
should I do differently?

229
00:19:12,688 --> 00:19:14,788
I don't know. I don't know
anything about battles.

230
00:19:14,890 --> 00:19:18,257
Just don't do
what he wants you to do.

231
00:19:18,359 --> 00:19:19,592
Aye, that's good advice.

232
00:19:19,694 --> 00:19:21,060
You think that's obvious?

233
00:19:21,162 --> 00:19:22,528
Well, it is
a bit obvious.

234
00:19:22,630 --> 00:19:23,896
If you had asked
for my advice earlier,

235
00:19:23,998 --> 00:19:25,665
I would have told you
not to attack Winterfell

236
00:19:25,767 --> 00:19:28,066
until we had a larger force,
or is that obvious, too?

237
00:19:28,168 --> 00:19:30,468
When will we have
a larger force?

238
00:19:30,571 --> 00:19:32,604
We've pleaded with every
house that'll have us.

239
00:19:32,706 --> 00:19:33,972
The Blackfish
can't help us.

240
00:19:34,074 --> 00:19:36,007
We're lucky to have
this many men.

241
00:19:36,109 --> 00:19:39,610
- It's not enough.
- No, it's not enough. It's what we have.

242
00:19:44,016 --> 00:19:47,951
Battles have been won
against greater odds.

243
00:19:54,326 --> 00:19:56,192
If Ramsay wins,

244
00:19:56,294 --> 00:19:58,193
I'm not going
back there alive.

245
00:19:58,295 --> 00:19:59,962
Do you understand me?

246
00:20:02,466 --> 00:20:06,468
I won't let ever
let him touch you again.

247
00:20:09,372 --> 00:20:11,472
I'll protect you,
I promise.

248
00:20:12,809 --> 00:20:15,209
No one can protect me.

249
00:20:15,311 --> 00:20:17,211
No one
can protect anyone.

250
00:20:29,023 --> 00:20:30,923
( sighs )

251
00:20:35,930 --> 00:20:37,963
<i>Davos:
You think there's hope?</i>

252
00:20:38,065 --> 00:20:40,398
Tormund: I've never seen
these Bolton fuckers fight.

253
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:42,834
And they've never seen
the free folk fight,

254
00:20:42,936 --> 00:20:44,936
so, yes, there's hope.

255
00:20:47,107 --> 00:20:50,641
You want to avenge
your king, don't you?

256
00:20:50,743 --> 00:20:53,577
It wasn't the Boltons
defeated Stannis.

257
00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:56,146
It was Stannis himself.

258
00:20:56,248 --> 00:20:57,914
I loved the man.

259
00:20:58,017 --> 00:21:00,416
He lifted me up
and made me something.

260
00:21:00,518 --> 00:21:03,653
But he had demons in his skull
whispering foul things.

261
00:21:03,755 --> 00:21:06,355
- You saw these demons?
- What?

262
00:21:07,558 --> 00:21:09,824
No, it's a manner
of speaking.

263
00:21:11,528 --> 00:21:14,629
Not actual demons.

264
00:21:14,731 --> 00:21:16,064
Oh.

265
00:21:16,166 --> 00:21:19,100
Well, you loved
that cunt Stannis

266
00:21:19,202 --> 00:21:21,335
and I loved
the man he burned.

267
00:21:21,437 --> 00:21:23,470
Mance didn't have
demons in his skull.

268
00:21:23,572 --> 00:21:27,074
He didn't torch people
or listen to some red witch.

269
00:21:27,176 --> 00:21:29,542
I believed in him.

270
00:21:29,644 --> 00:21:33,579
I thought he was the man to
lead us through the Long Night.

271
00:21:33,682 --> 00:21:35,948
But I was wrong
just like you.

272
00:21:37,886 --> 00:21:41,019
Maybe that was our mistake,
believing in kings.

273
00:21:42,723 --> 00:21:45,157
Jon Snow's not a king.

274
00:21:46,927 --> 00:21:48,694
No, he's not.

275
00:21:51,764 --> 00:21:55,833
<i>I need a good drink to help me
sleep the night before a fight.</i>

276
00:21:55,935 --> 00:21:57,401
You want some?

277
00:21:57,503 --> 00:21:59,904
I have a jug
of sour goat's milk

278
00:22:00,006 --> 00:22:01,938
stronger than any
of that grape water

279
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:04,207
you southern twats
like sucking on.

280
00:22:04,309 --> 00:22:06,142
No, thanks.
It does sound delicious,

281
00:22:06,244 --> 00:22:08,845
but I better keep
a clear head.

282
00:22:08,947 --> 00:22:11,280
I can never sleep
the night before a battle.

283
00:22:11,382 --> 00:22:13,048
So what do you do
all night?

284
00:22:13,150 --> 00:22:15,350
I walk.

285
00:22:15,453 --> 00:22:17,186
Think and walk.

286
00:22:17,288 --> 00:22:19,421
Think and walk until I'm
far enough away from camp

287
00:22:19,523 --> 00:22:21,622
that no one can hear me
shitting my guts out.

288
00:22:21,725 --> 00:22:23,658
( laughs )

289
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:25,693
Happy shitting.

290
00:22:38,974 --> 00:22:40,040
My lady.

291
00:22:44,545 --> 00:22:46,946
You weren't at
the war council.

292
00:22:48,449 --> 00:22:50,382
I'm not a soldier.

293
00:22:51,485 --> 00:22:53,818
Any advice?

294
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:56,221
Don't lose.

295
00:23:02,027 --> 00:23:04,094
If I do, if I fall...

296
00:23:06,599 --> 00:23:09,133
don't bring me back.

297
00:23:09,235 --> 00:23:11,168
I'll have to try.

298
00:23:11,270 --> 00:23:13,369
I'm ordering you
not to bring me back.

299
00:23:13,471 --> 00:23:15,138
I am not your servant,
Jon Snow.

300
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:17,507
You're in my camp.
I'm the commander.

301
00:23:17,609 --> 00:23:20,276
I serve the Lord of Light.

302
00:23:20,378 --> 00:23:22,644
I do what he commands.

303
00:23:22,746 --> 00:23:24,146
How do you know
what he commands?

304
00:23:25,649 --> 00:23:28,884
I interpret his signs

305
00:23:28,986 --> 00:23:31,153
as well as I can.

306
00:23:33,723 --> 00:23:36,056
If the Lord didn't
want me to bring you back,

307
00:23:36,159 --> 00:23:38,726
how did I bring you back?

308
00:23:38,828 --> 00:23:41,362
I have no power.

309
00:23:41,464 --> 00:23:44,831
Only what he gives me
and he gave me you.

310
00:23:46,201 --> 00:23:48,468
Why?

311
00:23:48,570 --> 00:23:50,737
I don't know.

312
00:23:55,342 --> 00:23:59,845
Maybe you're only needed for this small
part of his plan and nothing else.

313
00:23:59,947 --> 00:24:02,947
Maybe he brought you here
to die again.

314
00:24:07,187 --> 00:24:10,188
What kind of god would do
something like that?

315
00:24:11,958 --> 00:24:14,257
The one we've got.

316
00:25:45,708 --> 00:25:49,176
<i>( horn blowing )</i>

317
00:26:04,059 --> 00:26:07,259
Last time we saw each other
was at Winterfell, yes?

318
00:26:10,298 --> 00:26:13,599
You were making jokes about
my height, I seem to recall.

319
00:26:15,902 --> 00:26:17,936
Everyone who makes a joke
about a dwarf's height

320
00:26:18,038 --> 00:26:21,873
thinks he's the only person ever to
make a joke about a dwarf's height.

321
00:26:21,975 --> 00:26:25,275
"The height of nobility,"
"a man of your stature,"

322
00:26:25,377 --> 00:26:27,210
"someone to look up to."

323
00:26:28,781 --> 00:26:30,614
You're all making the same
five or six jokes.

324
00:26:30,716 --> 00:26:33,984
- It was a long time ago.
- It was.

325
00:26:34,086 --> 00:26:37,353
And how have things been
going for you since then?

326
00:26:37,455 --> 00:26:40,256
Not so well, I gather.

327
00:26:40,358 --> 00:26:42,892
Can't imagine you would
have murdered the Stark boys

328
00:26:42,994 --> 00:26:44,193
if things had
been going well.

329
00:26:44,295 --> 00:26:45,894
I didn't murder
the Stark boys.

330
00:26:45,996 --> 00:26:48,863
But I did things that were
just as bad or worse.

331
00:26:48,966 --> 00:26:50,165
And he paid for them.

332
00:26:50,267 --> 00:26:52,233
Doesn't seem like it.

333
00:26:52,336 --> 00:26:54,169
He's still alive.

334
00:26:54,271 --> 00:26:56,236
It was complicated
for you, I'm sure,

335
00:26:56,339 --> 00:26:58,505
growing up at Winterfell.

336
00:26:58,607 --> 00:27:01,775
Never quite knowing
who you were.

337
00:27:01,877 --> 00:27:05,446
But then, we all live
complicated lives, don't we?

338
00:27:05,548 --> 00:27:07,480
You've brought us 100 ships
from the Iron Fleet

339
00:27:07,582 --> 00:27:09,215
<i>with men to sail them.</i>

340
00:27:09,317 --> 00:27:11,517
In return, I expect
you want me to support

341
00:27:11,619 --> 00:27:14,053
your claim to the throne
of the Iron Islands?

342
00:27:14,155 --> 00:27:16,054
Not my claim.
Hers.

343
00:27:16,156 --> 00:27:18,156
And what's wrong with you?

344
00:27:18,258 --> 00:27:19,758
I'm not fit to rule.

345
00:27:19,860 --> 00:27:21,426
We can agree
upon that at least.

346
00:27:21,528 --> 00:27:24,129
Has the Iron Islands
ever had a queen before?

347
00:27:24,231 --> 00:27:25,797
No more than Westeros.

348
00:27:27,567 --> 00:27:30,935
Our Uncle Euron returned home
after a long absence.

349
00:27:31,037 --> 00:27:34,505
He murdered our father and took
the Salt Throne from Yara.

350
00:27:34,607 --> 00:27:37,173
He would have murdered us
if we'd stayed.

351
00:27:38,643 --> 00:27:41,711
Lord Tyrion tells me your
father was a terrible king.

352
00:27:41,813 --> 00:27:43,947
You and I
have that in common.

353
00:27:45,550 --> 00:27:46,715
We do.

354
00:27:46,817 --> 00:27:49,151
And both murdered
by a usurper as well.

355
00:27:50,488 --> 00:27:52,054
Will their ships
be enough?

356
00:27:52,156 --> 00:27:55,224
With the former Masters'
fleet, possibly.

357
00:27:55,326 --> 00:27:57,358
Barely.

358
00:27:57,460 --> 00:28:00,128
There are more than 100
ships in the Iron Fleet.

359
00:28:00,230 --> 00:28:02,630
There are and Euron
is building more.

360
00:28:02,732 --> 00:28:04,365
He's going to offer
them to you.

361
00:28:04,467 --> 00:28:05,900
So why shouldn't
I wait for him?

362
00:28:06,002 --> 00:28:08,535
The Iron Fleet
isn't all he's bringing.

363
00:28:08,637 --> 00:28:10,737
He also wants
to give you--

364
00:28:10,839 --> 00:28:14,474
His big cock,
I think he said.

365
00:28:14,576 --> 00:28:17,810
<i>Euron's offer is also an
offer of marriage, you see.</i>

366
00:28:17,912 --> 00:28:19,712
<i>You won't get one
without the other.</i>

367
00:28:19,814 --> 00:28:22,314
And I imagine your offer is
free of any marriage demands?

368
00:28:22,417 --> 00:28:25,718
I never demand, but I'm
up for anything, really.

369
00:28:27,554 --> 00:28:30,221
<i>Theon: He murdered our father
and would have murdered us.</i>

370
00:28:30,323 --> 00:28:32,891
<i>He'll murder you as soon
as you have what he wants.</i>

371
00:28:32,993 --> 00:28:34,659
The Seven Kingdoms.

372
00:28:34,761 --> 00:28:35,927
All of them.

373
00:28:36,029 --> 00:28:37,728
And you don't want
the Seven Kingdoms?

374
00:28:37,830 --> 00:28:41,098
Your ancestors defeated ours
and took the Iron Islands.

375
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:43,667
We ask you
to give them back.

376
00:28:43,769 --> 00:28:45,035
And that's all?

377
00:28:45,137 --> 00:28:47,703
We'd like you to help us
murder an uncle or two

378
00:28:47,806 --> 00:28:49,672
who don't think
a woman's fit to rule.

379
00:28:49,774 --> 00:28:51,407
Reasonable.

380
00:28:53,711 --> 00:28:56,312
What if everyone starts
demanding their independence?

381
00:28:56,414 --> 00:28:58,413
She's not demanding,
she's asking.

382
00:28:58,515 --> 00:29:01,283
The others are free
to ask as well.

383
00:29:05,089 --> 00:29:08,522
Our fathers were evil men,
all of us here.

384
00:29:08,624 --> 00:29:11,058
They left the world
worse than they found it.

385
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:12,760
<i>We're not going
to do that.</i>

386
00:29:12,862 --> 00:29:15,863
We're going to leave the world
better than we found it.

387
00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:21,401
You will support my claim as
queen of the Seven Kingdoms

388
00:29:21,503 --> 00:29:24,804
and respect the integrity
of the Seven Kingdoms.

389
00:29:24,906 --> 00:29:29,441
No more reaving, roving,
raiding, or raping.

390
00:29:30,778 --> 00:29:32,244
That's our way of life.

391
00:29:32,346 --> 00:29:33,879
No more.

392
00:29:41,454 --> 00:29:43,154
No more.

393
00:30:11,214 --> 00:30:14,616

394
00:33:27,692 --> 00:33:30,292
Do you like games,
little man?

395
00:33:30,394 --> 00:33:32,461
Let's play a game.

396
00:33:36,099 --> 00:33:37,799
Run to your brother.

397
00:33:37,901 --> 00:33:39,734
The sooner
you make it to him,

398
00:33:39,836 --> 00:33:42,203
the sooner you get
to see him again.

399
00:33:44,873 --> 00:33:46,340
That's it.

400
00:33:46,442 --> 00:33:48,575
That's the game.

401
00:33:48,677 --> 00:33:50,577
Easy.

402
00:33:50,679 --> 00:33:52,579
Ready?

403
00:33:52,681 --> 00:33:53,946
Go.

404
00:33:57,952 --> 00:34:00,920
No, you have to run,
remember?

405
00:34:01,022 --> 00:34:03,155
Those are the rules.

414

00:55:02,658 --> 00:55:05,292
Is this where
I'll be staying now?

536
00:55:13,668 --> 00:55:15,702
No.

537
00:55:19,507 --> 00:55:23,275
Our time together is
about to come to an end.

538
00:55:26,213 --> 00:55:28,613
<i>That's all right.</i>

539
00:55:28,715 --> 00:55:30,548
You can't kill me.

540
00:55:32,185 --> 00:55:34,318
I'm part of you now.

541
00:55:37,123 --> 00:55:39,389
Your words will disappear.

542
00:55:42,094 --> 00:55:44,861
Your house will disappear.

543
00:55:44,963 --> 00:55:48,130
<i>Your name will disappear.</i>

544
00:55:50,101 --> 00:55:52,701
<i>All memory of you
will disappear.</i>

545
00:55:54,505 --> 00:55:57,673
( dogs growling )

546
00:56:03,446 --> 00:56:06,648
<i>( growling continues )</i>

547
00:56:12,855 --> 00:56:15,255
( growling continues )

548
00:56:19,794 --> 00:56:22,428
My hounds
will never harm me.

549
00:56:22,530 --> 00:56:24,964
You haven't fed them
in seven days.

550
00:56:25,066 --> 00:56:26,532
You said it yourself.

551
00:56:28,002 --> 00:56:30,669
<i>( dogs growling )</i>

552
00:56:30,771 --> 00:56:32,370
They're loyal beasts.

553
00:56:32,472 --> 00:56:34,306
<i>They were.</i>

554
00:56:34,408 --> 00:56:36,274
Now they're starving.

555
00:56:38,912 --> 00:56:41,211
<i>( dogs growling )</i>

556
00:56:42,848 --> 00:56:44,915
( growling )

557
00:57:00,297 --> 00:57:02,164
Sit.

558
00:57:02,266 --> 00:57:03,699
Down.

559
00:57:03,801 --> 00:57:06,401
Down!

560
00:57:07,504 --> 00:57:09,670
Down! Down!

561
00:57:09,772 --> 00:57:11,706
Down!

562
00:57:13,610 --> 00:57:16,277
- ( growling, barking )
- ( Ramsay screaming )

563
00:57:16,379 --> 00:57:19,280
<i>- ( crunching, tearing )
- ( screaming continues )</i>

564
00:57:23,986 --> 00:57:25,752
( screaming continues )

565
00:57:55,414 --> 00:57:57,648
<i>( music playing )</i>
