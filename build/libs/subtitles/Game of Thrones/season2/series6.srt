1
00:00:00,978 --> 00:00:02,679
<i>Myrcella is my only daughter.</i>

2
00:00:02,714 --> 00:00:05,215
Do you really think I'll let you
sell her like a common whore?

3
00:00:05,249 --> 00:00:07,184
Dorne is the safest
place for her.

4
00:00:07,218 --> 00:00:10,019
- You cannot stop it.
- No!

5
00:00:15,459 --> 00:00:17,927
No, wait.
It wasn't her.

6
00:00:20,029 --> 00:00:23,898
You can't avenge him if you're dead.

7
00:00:23,933 --> 00:00:27,368
On behalf of the warlocks
of Qarth, I welcome you.

8
00:00:29,171 --> 00:00:32,039
It would be an honor to host you
at the House of the Undying,

9
00:00:32,074 --> 00:00:34,208
Mother of Dragons.

10
00:00:34,243 --> 00:00:36,378
<i>Stannis will be here</i>
<i>in an hour.</i>

11
00:00:36,412 --> 00:00:38,180
Renly's bannermen
will flock to him.

12
00:00:38,214 --> 00:00:40,082
Calling yourself king
doesn't make you one.

13
00:00:40,116 --> 00:00:42,818
And if Renly wasn't a king,
I wasn't a queen.

14
00:00:42,852 --> 00:00:46,121
- Do you want to be a queen?
- I want to be <i>the</i> queen.

15
00:00:46,156 --> 00:00:47,790
There on that mountain.

16
00:00:47,825 --> 00:00:50,393
We need to get rid
of those lookouts.

17
00:00:50,427 --> 00:00:52,628
I need to move fast
and silent.

18
00:00:52,663 --> 00:00:54,964
Lord Commander,
I'd like to join Lord Qhorin.

19
00:00:54,998 --> 00:00:56,232
Aye.

20
00:00:56,266 --> 00:00:57,734
Are you going
to kill Joffrey?

21
00:00:57,768 --> 00:00:59,836
- If the Gods give me strength.
- And then what?

22
00:00:59,870 --> 00:01:01,704
First we have to
win the war.

23
00:01:01,738 --> 00:01:03,540
You never told me
where you're from.

24
00:01:03,574 --> 00:01:05,108
<i>Volantis.</i>

25
00:01:05,142 --> 00:01:07,310
You're one of them now.
I should have let you burn.

26
00:01:07,345 --> 00:01:09,345
You saved me
and the two I was with.

27
00:01:09,380 --> 00:01:11,214
You stole three deaths
from the Red God.

28
00:01:11,248 --> 00:01:13,416
- Speak three names.
- I can name anyone?

29
00:01:13,450 --> 00:01:15,685
- <i>And you'll kill him?</i>
- A man has said.

30
00:01:15,719 --> 00:01:18,220
<i>The one who tortures everyone.</i>
<i>They call him the Tickler.</i>

31
00:01:20,023 --> 00:01:22,290
The Stony Shore's not far
from Torrhen's Square.

32
00:01:22,325 --> 00:01:24,826
More impressive prize than
a few fisherman's daughters.

33
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:27,228
Soon as Winterfell got word that
we'd taken Torrhen's Square,

34
00:01:27,262 --> 00:01:29,597
the Starks would send
their men to take it back.

35
00:01:29,631 --> 00:01:31,599
Take me to my ship.

36
00:01:31,634 --> 00:01:34,302
Lord Stark, Torrhen's Square
is under siege.

37
00:01:34,336 --> 00:01:36,638
Torrhen's Square is barely
40 leagues from here.

38
00:01:36,673 --> 00:01:38,473
Go, Ser Rodrik.
Take the men you need.

39
00:01:38,508 --> 00:01:40,008
<i>What did you see</i>
<i>in your dream?</i>

40
00:01:40,043 --> 00:01:41,477
That the sea came
to Winterfell.

41
00:01:41,512 --> 00:01:43,313
<i>Drowned men were</i>
<i>floating in the yard.</i>

42
00:01:43,347 --> 00:01:48,651
Ser Rodrik
was one of them.

43
00:01:51,788 --> 00:01:54,323
<i>( Theme music playing )</i>

46
00:02:02,398 --> 00:03:37,682
?

47
00:04:20,136 --> 00:04:22,972
I've taken your castle.

48
00:04:23,007 --> 00:04:25,708
- Theon?
- It's Prince Theon now.

49
00:04:25,743 --> 00:04:28,277
Get up.
You have to get dressed.

50
00:04:28,312 --> 00:04:30,680
I've taken Winterfell.

51
00:04:30,715 --> 00:04:33,716
I took it.
I'm occupying it.

52
00:04:33,751 --> 00:04:36,852
I sent men over the walls
with grappling claws and ropes.

53
00:04:36,887 --> 00:04:39,989
- Why?
- To take the castle.

54
00:04:40,023 --> 00:04:44,426
- You went with Robb.
- And he sent me back to Pyke.

55
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:48,096
I'm a Greyjoy. I can't fight
for Robb and my father both.

56
00:04:49,698 --> 00:04:52,166
- Where's Hodor?
- I don't know.

57
00:04:52,201 --> 00:04:54,569
Find the halfwit.

58
00:04:54,604 --> 00:04:57,539
My men are bringing your people
together in the courtyard.

59
00:04:57,573 --> 00:04:59,007
Why?

60
00:04:59,042 --> 00:05:01,009
So you and I can
go down and tell them

61
00:05:01,044 --> 00:05:03,912
- how you've yielded Winterfell to me.
- I won't.

62
00:05:03,946 --> 00:05:06,014
Yes, you will.

63
00:05:06,048 --> 00:05:09,116
I won't.
I'll never yield.

64
00:05:09,151 --> 00:05:11,219
We'll fight you
and throw you out.

65
00:05:17,193 --> 00:05:18,627
The castle is mine,

66
00:05:18,662 --> 00:05:21,097
but these people
are still yours.

67
00:05:21,131 --> 00:05:23,299
You'll yield
to keep them safe,

68
00:05:23,334 --> 00:05:25,803
to keep them alive.

69
00:05:25,837 --> 00:05:28,639
That's what a good
lord would do.

70
00:05:31,442 --> 00:05:34,277
Think carefully about
what you want to say.

71
00:05:37,348 --> 00:05:39,382
Theon.

72
00:05:39,416 --> 00:05:41,383
Did you hate us
the whole time?

73
00:05:49,225 --> 00:05:51,326
I've yielded
Winterfell to Theon.

74
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,295
Louder.

75
00:05:53,329 --> 00:05:55,130
Say Prince Theon.

76
00:05:55,165 --> 00:05:58,201
I've yielded Winterfell
to Prince Theon.

77
00:05:58,235 --> 00:05:59,936
You all know me.

78
00:05:59,970 --> 00:06:02,772
Aye, we know you for
a steaming sack of shit.

79
00:06:02,807 --> 00:06:04,474
Farlen, you be silent.

80
00:06:04,508 --> 00:06:07,611
Listen to your
little Lord, Farlen.

81
00:06:07,646 --> 00:06:09,413
He has more sense
than you do.

82
00:06:09,448 --> 00:06:11,315
All of you should do
as he commands.

83
00:06:11,350 --> 00:06:15,052
My father has donned the
ancient crown of salt and rock

84
00:06:15,087 --> 00:06:18,589
and declared himself
King of the Iron Islands.

85
00:06:18,623 --> 00:06:21,825
He claims the North as well
by right of conquest.

86
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:23,627
You are all his subjects.

87
00:06:23,661 --> 00:06:26,397
Bugger that.
I serve the Starks.

88
00:06:26,431 --> 00:06:28,523
If you think you can
hold the North with this--

89
00:06:28,548 --> 00:06:29,833
Shut up!

90
00:06:29,834 --> 00:06:33,304
<i>If you serve me as loyally</i>
<i>as you served Ned Stark,</i>

91
00:06:33,338 --> 00:06:36,407
<i>I  will be as good to you</i>
<i>as he ever was.</i>

92
00:06:36,441 --> 00:06:38,542
Betray me, and you will
wish you hadn't.

93
00:06:40,345 --> 00:06:43,514
Maester Luwin,
send a raven to Pyke

94
00:06:43,548 --> 00:06:46,249
informing my father
of my victory here

95
00:06:46,283 --> 00:06:48,852
and one to Deepwood Motte
to my sister.

96
00:06:48,886 --> 00:06:53,189
Inform her that she's
to bring 500 men to Winterfell.

97
00:06:56,727 --> 00:06:58,928
You are a Maester
of the Citadel

98
00:06:58,962 --> 00:07:02,230
sworn to serve the lord
of Winterfell, are you not?

99
00:07:02,264 --> 00:07:03,665
I am.

100
00:07:03,699 --> 00:07:05,567
I am the Lord
of Winterfell

101
00:07:05,601 --> 00:07:07,535
as Bran just informed you.

102
00:07:09,071 --> 00:07:11,173
Send the ravens.

103
00:07:13,043 --> 00:07:15,377
My Lord.

104
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:20,150
My Lord Greyjoy.

105
00:07:20,184 --> 00:07:23,687
I see you've finally learned
how to address your betters.

106
00:07:23,722 --> 00:07:25,256
What do you want?

107
00:07:25,290 --> 00:07:27,558
I was brought here
a captive.

108
00:07:27,593 --> 00:07:29,961
You were here the day
I was taken.

109
00:07:29,995 --> 00:07:33,965
I'm the one who took you.
What of it?

110
00:07:33,999 --> 00:07:36,701
Let me serve you.

111
00:07:36,736 --> 00:07:39,337
<i>Serve me how?</i>

112
00:07:39,371 --> 00:07:41,839
I need fighters,
not kitchen sluts.

113
00:07:41,873 --> 00:07:44,875
It was Robb Stark who
put me in the kitchens.

114
00:07:44,910 --> 00:07:47,445
Put a spear
in my hand again.

115
00:07:47,479 --> 00:07:49,547
So you can bury it
in my neck?

116
00:07:49,581 --> 00:07:51,149
Do you take me
for a fool?

117
00:07:51,183 --> 00:07:52,617
Get up.

118
00:07:52,651 --> 00:07:55,720
Step aside.

119
00:07:55,755 --> 00:07:58,022
Why?

120
00:07:58,057 --> 00:08:01,493
It's your dream,
little Lord.

121
00:08:01,528 --> 00:08:04,964
The ocean has come
to swallow this place.

122
00:08:04,998 --> 00:08:07,934
I ain't letting it
drown me.

123
00:08:07,968 --> 00:08:10,770
- And in a few days' time--
<i>Greyjoy!</i>

124
00:08:15,776 --> 00:08:17,877
<i>What have they</i>
<i>done to him?</i>

125
00:08:17,911 --> 00:08:20,980
We caught this one on this way
back from Torrhen's Square.

126
00:08:21,014 --> 00:08:23,949
Took out two of ours
before I got his sword.

127
00:08:23,983 --> 00:08:27,419
Ser Rodrik, it grieves me that
we meet as foes.

128
00:08:27,453 --> 00:08:31,290
It grieves me you've less honor
than a back alley whore.

129
00:08:31,324 --> 00:08:34,793
You were raised here
under this roof.

130
00:08:34,827 --> 00:08:37,496
- These people are your people.
- They are not my people.

131
00:08:37,531 --> 00:08:39,732
King Robb thought of you
as a brother.

132
00:08:39,767 --> 00:08:42,702
My brothers are dead.

133
00:08:42,736 --> 00:08:45,505
They died fighting
Stark men, men like you.

134
00:08:45,539 --> 00:08:48,975
Aye, they died fighting
a war your father started.

135
00:08:49,009 --> 00:08:51,244
Lord Stark raised you
among his own sons.

136
00:08:51,278 --> 00:08:53,412
Among them,
but not one of them.

137
00:08:53,446 --> 00:08:56,248
I was his hostage
taken from my home.

138
00:08:56,282 --> 00:08:57,983
If he were alive
to see this--

139
00:08:58,017 --> 00:08:59,852
He's not.
He's dead.

140
00:08:59,886 --> 00:09:01,954
The Seven Kingdoms
are at war.

141
00:09:01,988 --> 00:09:04,256
And Winterfell is mine.

142
00:09:04,291 --> 00:09:06,959
I should have put
a sword in your belly

143
00:09:06,993 --> 00:09:08,527
instead of
in your hand.

144
00:09:08,561 --> 00:09:11,663
You've served this House
faithfully, old man.

145
00:09:11,698 --> 00:09:13,766
But keep talking
and I'll--

146
00:09:15,635 --> 00:09:18,604
Take him to the cells.
Lock him up--

147
00:09:18,639 --> 00:09:20,340
My prince,

148
00:09:20,374 --> 00:09:22,942
you cannot let that stand.
He must pay.

149
00:09:22,977 --> 00:09:24,877
I'll lock him in a cell
until he rots--

150
00:09:24,912 --> 00:09:27,914
No, he has to pay
the iron price.

151
00:09:27,948 --> 00:09:31,051
They'll never respect
you while he lives.

152
00:09:49,406 --> 00:09:51,574
Ser Rodrik,

153
00:09:51,609 --> 00:09:53,042
I sentence you to death.

154
00:09:53,077 --> 00:09:55,544
No! You said no harm
would come to them if I yielded.

155
00:09:55,579 --> 00:09:57,947
The old man couldn't
keep his mouth shut.

156
00:09:57,981 --> 00:10:00,649
I urge you not to make
a hasty decision.

157
00:10:00,684 --> 00:10:03,653
He disrespected me
in front of my men.

158
00:10:03,687 --> 00:10:05,154
That was his decision,
not mine.

159
00:10:05,188 --> 00:10:07,656
He is worth more
to you alive than dead.

160
00:10:07,992 --> 00:10:10,993
The Starks will pay.

161
00:10:11,028 --> 00:10:13,863
Please, Theon,

162
00:10:13,897 --> 00:10:15,831
think what you do.

163
00:10:26,475 --> 00:10:28,375
You'll address me
as Prince Theon

164
00:10:28,410 --> 00:10:30,310
or you'll be next.

165
00:10:30,345 --> 00:10:32,312
Come.

166
00:10:33,181 --> 00:10:34,748
No!

167
00:10:34,783 --> 00:10:37,984
- No!
<i>- Theon!</i>

168
00:10:38,853 --> 00:10:40,921
Please!

169
00:10:40,955 --> 00:10:42,823
Ser Rodrik!

170
00:10:42,858 --> 00:10:45,693
He who passes the sentence
should swing the sword.

171
00:10:45,727 --> 00:10:48,496
<i>- I'm begging you!</i>
- Coward.

172
00:10:51,266 --> 00:10:54,368
Stop! Stop right now!

173
00:10:54,403 --> 00:10:56,137
You don't give commands anymore,
little Lord.

174
00:10:56,171 --> 00:10:58,839
- Please, stop this. Please stop him.
<i>- Hush now, child.</i>

175
00:10:58,874 --> 00:11:01,976
I'm off to see your father.

176
00:11:04,112 --> 00:11:06,981
You said no harm
would come!

177
00:11:07,015 --> 00:11:09,750
<i>You said no harm would come.</i>
<i>Theon, please.</i>

178
00:11:09,785 --> 00:11:12,587
Any last words, old man?

179
00:11:12,621 --> 00:11:15,523
Gods help you,
Theon Greyjoy.

180
00:11:15,558 --> 00:11:17,658
Now you are truly lost.

181
00:11:17,692 --> 00:11:20,128
<i>Theon, please, don't.</i>

182
00:11:20,162 --> 00:11:23,264
<i>- Do something.</i>
<i>- I'll do anything. Please!</i>

183
00:11:23,298 --> 00:11:24,933
<i>No, please, stop it!</i>

184
00:11:56,367 --> 00:11:58,769
Ghost, stay with us.

185
00:11:58,803 --> 00:12:00,870
Ghost!

186
00:12:00,905 --> 00:12:02,539
There goes your pet.

187
00:12:02,573 --> 00:12:04,140
<i>He's not a pet.</i>

188
00:12:04,175 --> 00:12:06,676
<i>You're right,</i>
<i>he's not.</i>

189
00:12:06,710 --> 00:12:09,279
You can't tame
a wild thing.

190
00:12:09,313 --> 00:12:11,080
You can't trust
a wild thing.

191
00:12:11,115 --> 00:12:14,150
- Ghost is different.
- So you think.

192
00:12:14,184 --> 00:12:16,552
Wild creatures
have their own rules,

193
00:12:16,587 --> 00:12:18,754
their own reasons.

194
00:12:18,789 --> 00:12:20,757
And you'll never
know them.

195
00:12:20,791 --> 00:12:24,460
Now the wildlings
we're looking for

196
00:12:24,495 --> 00:12:26,896
sleep during the day
and hunt at night.

197
00:12:29,333 --> 00:12:31,901
I thought you said
you couldn't know wild things.

198
00:12:31,935 --> 00:12:33,836
I said you can't.

199
00:12:33,870 --> 00:12:36,906
They find a nice cave
to hide in while the sun's up

200
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:38,874
and do their killing
when it's dark.

201
00:12:38,909 --> 00:12:41,944
- We could do the same.
- No, we couldn't.

202
00:12:41,979 --> 00:12:44,180
This is their country.

203
00:12:44,214 --> 00:12:47,250
They know where to walk,
where not to walk.

204
00:12:47,285 --> 00:12:49,186
I've lost good men
who fell into a crevasse

205
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:51,355
they didn't see
till they were in it.

206
00:12:52,490 --> 00:12:54,959
My father always said
I'm of the North.

207
00:12:56,794 --> 00:12:59,663
- I wasn't joking.
- Look around, boy.

208
00:12:59,697 --> 00:13:02,933
This look like
home to you?

209
00:13:02,967 --> 00:13:06,170
You start thinking
you know this place, it'll kill you.

210
00:13:07,238 --> 00:13:09,506
You understand me?

211
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:11,975
No, you don't.

212
00:13:12,009 --> 00:13:13,943
We're at war.

213
00:13:13,978 --> 00:13:15,645
We've always been at war.

214
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:18,214
It's never going to end 'cause
we're not fighting an enemy.

215
00:13:18,249 --> 00:13:21,818
We're fighting the North
and it's not going anywhere.

216
00:13:21,852 --> 00:13:24,854
The Watch has given
you a great gift.

217
00:13:24,888 --> 00:13:27,423
You only have one thing
to give in return--

218
00:13:27,458 --> 00:13:28,891
your life.

219
00:13:28,925 --> 00:13:30,259
I'll gladly give my life.

220
00:13:30,293 --> 00:13:32,661
I don't want you
to be glad about it.

221
00:13:32,696 --> 00:13:34,696
I want you to curse
and fight

222
00:13:34,731 --> 00:13:37,165
until your heart's
done pumping.

223
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,635
And know this, boy--

224
00:13:39,669 --> 00:13:43,371
your death will be a gift
for them south of the Wall.

225
00:13:43,406 --> 00:13:45,606
They'll never know
what you've done.

226
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:47,141
They'll never know
how you died.

227
00:13:47,175 --> 00:13:49,276
They won't even
know your damn name,

228
00:13:49,310 --> 00:13:52,212
but they'll be alive because
some nameless bastard

229
00:13:52,246 --> 00:13:55,883
north of the Wall
gave his life for theirs.

230
00:13:55,917 --> 00:13:59,052
Now, do you understand me?

231
00:13:59,087 --> 00:14:00,821
I do.

232
00:14:00,855 --> 00:14:03,223
You're even dumber
than you look.

233
00:14:04,426 --> 00:14:06,493
It's just words, boy,

234
00:14:06,528 --> 00:14:08,495
to keep us a little
warmer in the night,

235
00:14:08,529 --> 00:14:11,766
make us feel like
we've got a purpose.

236
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:14,235
Come on.

237
00:14:14,269 --> 00:14:16,604
We've got to find these
goat fuckers before night falls

238
00:14:16,629 --> 00:14:18,218
and they find us.

239
00:14:29,888 --> 00:14:32,456
- Can you read?
- My Lord?

240
00:14:32,491 --> 00:14:35,526
Can you read?

241
00:14:38,297 --> 00:14:41,598
This letter detailing
our infantry movements

242
00:14:41,633 --> 00:14:44,301
was meant for Lord Damon
of House Marbrand.

243
00:14:44,336 --> 00:14:48,139
It was sent to Lord Marlyn
of House Dormand.

244
00:14:48,173 --> 00:14:50,174
My apologies, My Lord.
I must have--

245
00:14:50,209 --> 00:14:53,745
Girl, fetch me the "History of the
Greater and the Lesser Houses."

246
00:14:53,779 --> 00:14:56,548
It's the one on the--

247
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:02,521
My cupbearer can read
better than you.

248
00:15:11,731 --> 00:15:14,900
To whom does House Dormand
owe allegiance?

249
00:15:17,270 --> 00:15:19,337
My Lord, I--

250
00:15:19,372 --> 00:15:22,174
To the Starks
of Winterfell!

251
00:15:22,208 --> 00:15:26,411
Who have 20,000 men
and my son!

252
00:15:27,847 --> 00:15:29,948
I judged you might be
good for something more

253
00:15:29,982 --> 00:15:32,550
than brutalizing peasants.

254
00:15:32,585 --> 00:15:34,952
I see I overestimated you.

255
00:15:36,421 --> 00:15:39,824
<i>If you ever put my son's</i>
<i>life at risk again, I'll...</i>

256
00:15:39,858 --> 00:15:42,359
Leave us.

257
00:15:50,334 --> 00:15:51,768
Put the book away, girl.

258
00:15:58,642 --> 00:16:02,278
Maybe you should devise our next
battle plan while you're about it.

259
00:16:08,256 --> 00:16:10,474
- Lord Petyr Baelish.
- Hmmm.

260
00:16:11,321 --> 00:16:13,456
Give us the room.

261
00:16:21,132 --> 00:16:22,967
Clear all this.

262
00:16:26,105 --> 00:16:28,907
- Lord Tywin.
- Baelish.

263
00:16:36,982 --> 00:16:39,750
- Wine?
- Thank you.

264
00:16:42,654 --> 00:16:44,588
What news
from the capital?

265
00:16:44,622 --> 00:16:48,024
I travelled here directly
from Renly Baratheon's camp.

266
00:16:48,059 --> 00:16:50,226
Ah, the late king Renly.

267
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:52,462
Rather a short reign.

268
00:16:52,497 --> 00:16:54,498
Murdered by a woman,
I hear.

269
00:16:54,533 --> 00:16:56,467
So they say.

270
00:16:56,501 --> 00:17:01,640
There has been talk
of other forces at work,

271
00:17:01,675 --> 00:17:04,109
dark forces.

272
00:17:04,144 --> 00:17:06,546
Here.

273
00:17:08,515 --> 00:17:10,951
Men love to blame demons

274
00:17:10,985 --> 00:17:14,721
when their grand plans
unravel.

275
00:17:14,755 --> 00:17:17,557
It is my belief
that a moment of chaos

276
00:17:17,592 --> 00:17:19,993
affords opportunities
lost soon after.

277
00:17:20,027 --> 00:17:23,163
You say that as if you were
the first man alive to think it.

278
00:17:23,197 --> 00:17:26,332
Yes, a crisis
is an opportunity.

279
00:17:26,366 --> 00:17:28,834
What other brilliant insights
have you brought me today?

280
00:17:28,868 --> 00:17:30,569
After the Lannisters
and the Starks,

281
00:17:30,603 --> 00:17:33,038
the Tyrells command
the largest host.

282
00:17:33,073 --> 00:17:35,208
Their lands are the most
fertile in the Seven Kingdoms,

283
00:17:35,242 --> 00:17:39,178
- feeding horses and soldiers.
- Yes, yes, yes.

284
00:17:39,213 --> 00:17:43,617
The Tyrells have not yet declared
for any of the surviving kings.

285
00:17:43,652 --> 00:17:46,821
Loras wants revenge. He blames
Stannis for Renly's death.

286
00:17:46,855 --> 00:17:49,524
And Margaery--

287
00:17:49,558 --> 00:17:51,327
Wants to be queen.

288
00:17:51,361 --> 00:17:54,162
Yes, she does.

289
00:17:55,464 --> 00:17:59,235
House Tyrell rebelled
against the Iron Throne,

290
00:17:59,269 --> 00:18:02,839
- against my grandson.
- They did.

291
00:18:02,873 --> 00:18:05,208
And perhaps that treason
should be punished

292
00:18:05,242 --> 00:18:07,144
<i>one day,</i>

293
00:18:07,178 --> 00:18:11,147
after Stannis and Robb Stark
are defeated.

294
00:18:13,384 --> 00:18:15,752
More wine for Lord Baelish.

295
00:18:21,859 --> 00:18:25,128
If you will allow me to represent
your family's interests,

296
00:18:25,162 --> 00:18:27,229
I believe that an advantageous
agreement--

297
00:18:27,264 --> 00:18:30,332
The Tyrell host has
returned to Highgarden?

298
00:18:30,367 --> 00:18:32,534
They have.

299
00:18:32,569 --> 00:18:34,469
Pardon, My Lord.

300
00:18:34,504 --> 00:18:36,438
It's only wine.

301
00:18:37,807 --> 00:18:39,941
You would ride
there yourself?

302
00:18:39,975 --> 00:18:41,876
Tonight, with your leave.

303
00:18:41,910 --> 00:18:44,144
I'll have an answer
by nightfall.

304
00:18:44,179 --> 00:18:45,846
That'll be all, girl.

305
00:18:51,452 --> 00:18:52,987
What else?

306
00:18:53,021 --> 00:18:55,155
On your son
Tyrion's directive,

307
00:18:55,190 --> 00:18:57,691
I met with Catelyn Stark.

308
00:18:57,726 --> 00:18:59,226
Why?

309
00:18:59,261 --> 00:19:01,763
<i>He had an interesting</i>
<i>proposal for her</i>

310
00:19:01,797 --> 00:19:05,000
- concerning her daughters.
- Hmm.

311
00:19:54,251 --> 00:19:57,419
- A girl.
- A wildling.

312
00:19:58,521 --> 00:19:59,855
We could question her.

313
00:19:59,889 --> 00:20:01,857
You could.

314
00:20:01,892 --> 00:20:03,492
She won't answer.

315
00:20:03,527 --> 00:20:06,996
I've known a wildling to bite off
his tongue instead of talking.

316
00:20:08,432 --> 00:20:11,233
- What's your name?
- Ygritte.

317
00:20:11,268 --> 00:20:14,336
She was reaching for this axe
when you got to her.

318
00:20:14,371 --> 00:20:18,107
Give her half a chance,
she'll bury it in your face.

319
00:20:18,141 --> 00:20:20,943
I gave you my name.

320
00:20:22,045 --> 00:20:24,713
I'm Jon Snow.

321
00:20:31,186 --> 00:20:33,121
You ought to burn
them you killed.

322
00:20:33,156 --> 00:20:35,824
<i>We'd need a big</i>
<i>fire for that.</i>

323
00:20:35,858 --> 00:20:39,862
Tell me, Ygritte,

324
00:20:39,896 --> 00:20:41,931
why do you want us
to build a big fire?

325
00:20:41,965 --> 00:20:45,202
Are there some more
friends in the area?

326
00:20:45,236 --> 00:20:48,572
Burn them or maybe you'll
need those swords again.

327
00:20:48,607 --> 00:20:51,142
Our boy here's already
killed one dead man.

328
00:20:51,176 --> 00:20:53,577
He can do it again
if he has to.

329
00:20:53,611 --> 00:20:56,179
What waits
beyond the pass?

330
00:20:56,214 --> 00:20:58,248
- The free folk.
- How many?

331
00:21:00,184 --> 00:21:02,118
Hundreds and thousands.

332
00:21:02,153 --> 00:21:04,688
More than you've
ever seen, crow.

333
00:21:04,722 --> 00:21:08,124
Why come to the mountains?

334
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:11,095
What's in the Frostfangs
your king could want?

335
00:21:18,837 --> 00:21:21,039
Do you mean to march
on the Wall?

336
00:21:27,113 --> 00:21:29,282
Do you know
who I am, girl?

337
00:21:29,316 --> 00:21:31,818
Qhorin Halfhand.

338
00:21:31,852 --> 00:21:33,352
Tell me true.

339
00:21:33,387 --> 00:21:36,656
If your people captured me,

340
00:21:36,690 --> 00:21:38,658
would they take me prisoner?

341
00:21:38,692 --> 00:21:40,860
They'd take your head
off your shoulders

342
00:21:40,894 --> 00:21:42,996
if they was feeling kind.

343
00:21:43,030 --> 00:21:45,632
If not,
they'd kill you slow.

344
00:21:48,302 --> 00:21:50,670
We have no food for her.

345
00:21:50,704 --> 00:21:53,038
Can't spare a man
to watch her.

346
00:21:53,073 --> 00:21:56,308
Can't let her go. She'll bring
Mance Rayder's army down on us.

347
00:21:56,342 --> 00:21:58,276
It needs to be done.

348
00:21:58,310 --> 00:22:00,811
- Want me to do it?
- No.

349
00:22:00,846 --> 00:22:03,180
No, I'll do it.

350
00:22:04,816 --> 00:22:06,883
Come, brothers.

351
00:22:06,917 --> 00:22:09,018
We'll leave him to it.

352
00:22:09,052 --> 00:22:11,053
We'll meet you
at the top.

353
00:22:11,088 --> 00:22:12,589
Don't take too long.

354
00:22:12,623 --> 00:22:14,257
We're deep in
their country now.

355
00:22:26,971 --> 00:22:30,774
You never killed
a woman before, did you?

356
00:22:30,808 --> 00:22:33,610
You don't need
to do it.

357
00:22:33,645 --> 00:22:35,846
Mance would take you.
I know he would.

358
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:38,282
There's secret ways.

359
00:22:38,316 --> 00:22:41,552
The crows would
never catch us.

360
00:22:41,587 --> 00:22:44,755
I'm as much a crow
as they are.

361
00:22:56,535 --> 00:22:58,603
Will you burn me...

362
00:22:58,637 --> 00:23:00,638
after?

363
00:23:00,672 --> 00:23:03,174
Can't.

364
00:23:03,208 --> 00:23:05,676
Someone might
see the smoke.

365
00:23:11,349 --> 00:23:13,685
Strike hard and true,

366
00:23:13,719 --> 00:23:15,920
Jon Snow,

367
00:23:15,955 --> 00:23:18,457
or I'll come back
and haunt you.

368
00:23:22,295 --> 00:23:25,231
That's cold.

369
00:23:27,434 --> 00:23:28,968
Go on.

370
00:23:29,003 --> 00:23:31,104
Be quick about it.

371
00:23:38,379 --> 00:23:39,879
Do it.

372
00:23:43,183 --> 00:23:45,250
Bastard, do it!

373
00:25:00,627 --> 00:25:03,862
You can't do it.
We both know it.

374
00:25:08,367 --> 00:25:11,069
The sun's going
down, Jon Snow.

375
00:25:11,103 --> 00:25:14,239
And your friends
are nowhere close.

376
00:25:14,273 --> 00:25:15,640
I'll find them.

377
00:25:15,674 --> 00:25:19,343
Call for the
go on.

378
00:25:19,378 --> 00:25:21,246
Call loudly.

379
00:25:28,220 --> 00:25:30,687
<i>May the Seven guide</i>
<i>the princess on her journey.</i>

380
00:25:32,157 --> 00:25:33,990
<i>May the Mother</i>
<i>give her health.</i>

381
00:25:34,025 --> 00:25:36,459
May the Crone
give her wisdom.

382
00:25:36,494 --> 00:25:39,462
May the Warrior
give her courage.

383
00:25:44,534 --> 00:25:46,735
One day I pray
you love someone.

384
00:25:47,737 --> 00:25:50,438
I pray you love
her so much,

385
00:25:50,472 --> 00:25:52,874
<i>when you close your eyes,</i>
<i>you see her face.</i>

386
00:25:54,944 --> 00:25:57,747
I want that for you.

387
00:25:57,781 --> 00:26:01,317
I want you to know what
it's like to love someone,

388
00:26:01,352 --> 00:26:04,554
to truly love someone,

389
00:26:04,588 --> 00:26:06,957
before I take her
from you.

390
00:26:24,374 --> 00:26:27,276
You sound like a little cat mewling
for his mother.

391
00:26:27,310 --> 00:26:28,810
Princes don't cry.

392
00:26:28,844 --> 00:26:31,647
- I saw you cry.
- Did you say something, My Lady?

393
00:26:31,681 --> 00:26:34,951
My little brother cried
when I left Winterfell.

394
00:26:34,985 --> 00:26:37,020
So?

395
00:26:37,054 --> 00:26:38,254
It seems a normal thing.

396
00:26:38,289 --> 00:26:40,290
Is your little brother
a prince?

397
00:26:40,324 --> 00:26:42,426
No.

398
00:26:42,460 --> 00:26:44,828
Not really relevant,
then, is it?

399
00:26:48,667 --> 00:26:50,702
Come, dog.

400
00:26:58,310 --> 00:27:00,143
<i>Hail, Joffrey!</i>

401
00:27:00,178 --> 00:27:02,846
<i>Hail to the king.</i>

402
00:27:04,848 --> 00:27:06,349
Seven blessings on you,
Your Grace.

403
00:27:06,383 --> 00:27:08,851
<i>Murderer! Bastard!</i>

404
00:27:08,885 --> 00:27:10,185
All hail the king.

405
00:27:10,220 --> 00:27:12,554
<i>He's no king.</i>
<i>He's a bastard!</i>

406
00:27:14,257 --> 00:27:16,024
Please, Your Grace,
we're hungry.

407
00:27:18,895 --> 00:27:21,964
<i>- Freak!</i>
- Get the prince back to the keep now.

408
00:27:21,998 --> 00:27:24,333
Yes, My Lord.
Come, quickly.

409
00:27:24,368 --> 00:27:26,335
<i>Please, Your Grace,</i>
<i>give us some food!</i>

410
00:27:26,370 --> 00:27:29,205
<i>Bread, Your Grace,</i>
<i>please!</i>

411
00:27:32,143 --> 00:27:33,910
Who threw that?

412
00:27:33,944 --> 00:27:35,912
<i>I want the man</i>
<i>who threw that.</i>

413
00:27:35,946 --> 00:27:37,814
Find who did that
and bring him to me!

414
00:27:37,848 --> 00:27:39,149
- Hold on!
- <i>Hold them back!</i>

415
00:27:39,183 --> 00:27:41,685
<i>Just kill them!</i>
<i>Kill them all!</i>

416
00:27:47,425 --> 00:27:49,793
- Move. Move!
<i>- Pull back!</i>

417
00:27:49,828 --> 00:27:51,762
<i>Tear him to pieces!</i>

418
00:27:51,796 --> 00:27:54,832
What are you doing?
I want these people executed!

419
00:27:54,866 --> 00:27:57,167
And they want
the same for you.

420
00:28:23,325 --> 00:28:25,626
Where's Sansa?

421
00:28:26,895 --> 00:28:28,963
<i>Through the door!</i>

422
00:28:28,997 --> 00:28:30,965
<i>Come on!</i>

423
00:28:36,505 --> 00:28:37,706
Protect the king!

424
00:28:37,740 --> 00:28:40,475
- Get back!
- Fall back!

425
00:28:40,510 --> 00:28:42,744
- Move!
- To the gates!

426
00:28:54,724 --> 00:28:57,993
- Come in! Come in!
- Keep him safe!

427
00:28:58,028 --> 00:29:00,363
Motherfucker!

428
00:29:00,397 --> 00:29:03,599
- Watch out. Hold them back.
- Come on.

429
00:29:10,541 --> 00:29:13,109
Hey!

430
00:29:13,143 --> 00:29:14,877
Traitors!

431
00:29:14,911 --> 00:29:16,779
I'll have
all their heads.

432
00:29:16,813 --> 00:29:18,647
Oh, you blind,
bloody fool.

433
00:29:18,682 --> 00:29:20,616
You can't insult me.

434
00:29:20,650 --> 00:29:23,518
We've had vicious kings
and we've had idiot kings,

435
00:29:23,553 --> 00:29:25,356
but I don't know if
we've ever been cursed with

436
00:29:25,381 --> 00:29:26,488
a vicious idiot for a king.

437
00:29:26,489 --> 00:29:28,256
- You can't--
- I can, I am.

438
00:29:28,290 --> 00:29:29,791
They attacked me!

439
00:29:29,825 --> 00:29:33,328
They threw a cow pie at you,
so you decided to kill them all?

440
00:29:33,362 --> 00:29:35,131
They're starving,
you fool.

441
00:29:35,165 --> 00:29:36,999
All because of a war
you started.

442
00:29:37,034 --> 00:29:39,535
You're talking to a king!

443
00:29:39,570 --> 00:29:41,805
And now I've struck a king.

444
00:29:41,839 --> 00:29:44,007
Did my hand fall
from my wrist?

445
00:29:44,042 --> 00:29:46,043
Where is the Stark girl?

446
00:29:46,078 --> 00:29:47,612
Let them have her.

447
00:29:47,646 --> 00:29:51,082
If she dies, you'll never
get your Uncle Jaime back.

448
00:29:51,116 --> 00:29:53,952
You owe him quite a bit,
you know.

449
00:30:02,428 --> 00:30:04,329
Where are you going?

450
00:30:04,364 --> 00:30:08,133
You ever been fucked, little girl?

451
00:30:08,168 --> 00:30:11,470
Come here.

452
00:30:11,505 --> 00:30:13,506
Take some men and go and find
the Stark girl.

453
00:30:13,540 --> 00:30:15,474
I take my orders
from the king.

454
00:30:16,943 --> 00:30:19,212
<i>This way!</i>

455
00:30:24,586 --> 00:30:27,355
Please!

456
00:30:27,389 --> 00:30:29,156
No, no.

457
00:30:48,307 --> 00:30:49,874
Please!

458
00:30:52,178 --> 00:30:54,579
You're all right now,
little bird.

459
00:30:54,614 --> 00:30:56,548
You're all right.

460
00:31:09,964 --> 00:31:13,967
<i>- We'll get you. We'll get you.</i>
<i>- This way.</i>

461
00:31:16,070 --> 00:31:17,570
Are you hurt,
My Lady?

462
00:31:17,605 --> 00:31:19,238
The little bird's
bleeding.

463
00:31:19,273 --> 00:31:21,006
Someone take her back
to her cage,

464
00:31:21,041 --> 00:31:22,908
<i>see to that cut.</i>

465
00:31:22,942 --> 00:31:24,476
Well done, Clegane.

466
00:31:25,344 --> 00:31:27,479
I didn't do it for you.

467
00:31:29,448 --> 00:31:31,215
He shouldn't
make me wait.

468
00:31:31,249 --> 00:31:35,720
The Spice King is the second
wealthiest man in Qarth.

469
00:31:35,754 --> 00:31:37,888
He makes everyone wait.

470
00:31:37,923 --> 00:31:41,158
Of course, you could have
avoided this embarrassment

471
00:31:41,193 --> 00:31:43,661
if you married
the wealthiest man in Qarth.

472
00:31:43,695 --> 00:31:45,730
I already have a husband.

473
00:31:45,764 --> 00:31:48,099
Khal Drogo is gone,
Khaleesi.

474
00:31:48,133 --> 00:31:52,003
You are far too young
to be a widow forever

475
00:31:52,038 --> 00:31:54,339
and far too beautiful.

476
00:31:54,374 --> 00:31:56,141
And you are far too smart

477
00:31:56,175 --> 00:31:59,644
to think that I will
succumb to flattery.

478
00:31:59,679 --> 00:32:01,613
I have travelled
very far in my life

479
00:32:01,648 --> 00:32:03,349
and met many women,

480
00:32:03,383 --> 00:32:05,184
but none that are
immune to flattery.

481
00:32:05,218 --> 00:32:07,920
- <i>The Mother of Dragons!</i>
- Ah.

482
00:32:07,955 --> 00:32:09,955
Here he comes.

483
00:32:09,990 --> 00:32:13,592
Forgive me. I had terrible
dreams last night.

484
00:32:13,627 --> 00:32:15,261
Terrible dreams.

485
00:32:15,295 --> 00:32:18,464
I could not sleep
until the sun was shining

486
00:32:18,498 --> 00:32:21,000
and the birds were singing.

487
00:32:21,034 --> 00:32:23,769
<i>Look what a beauty you are</i>

488
00:32:23,803 --> 00:32:26,371
<i>now the Red Waste</i>
<i>has been washed off you.</i>

489
00:32:26,406 --> 00:32:29,741
I am sorry about
all that unpleasantness.

490
00:32:29,775 --> 00:32:34,245
The silver hair
of a true Targaryen.

491
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:37,716
Xaro Xhoan Daxos,
she is far too lovely

492
00:32:37,751 --> 00:32:40,286
for a glorified
dockworker like yourself.

493
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:43,856
Very true, and yet they say
that your grandfather,

494
00:32:43,890 --> 00:32:45,958
who sold pepper
off the back of a wagon,

495
00:32:45,993 --> 00:32:49,395
married a lady far lovelier
and higher born than himself.

496
00:32:49,430 --> 00:32:51,663
Every lady alive
was lovelier

497
00:32:51,698 --> 00:32:53,932
and higher born
than my grandfather.

498
00:32:53,967 --> 00:32:55,800
<i>Ahem.</i>

499
00:32:55,835 --> 00:32:59,370
Did my servants not offer you
something to eat, to drink?

500
00:32:59,405 --> 00:33:01,339
I'll have them flogged
in the square.

501
00:33:01,373 --> 00:33:03,307
Thank you, My Lord.
You are a gracious host,

502
00:33:03,342 --> 00:33:06,243
but there is no servant alive
that can bring me what I want.

503
00:33:06,277 --> 00:33:09,079
Oh, she has a talent
for drama, this one.

504
00:33:09,113 --> 00:33:13,217
So, my little princess,
what is it you want?

505
00:33:13,285 --> 00:33:14,685
My birthright--

506
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:16,621
the Seven Kingdoms
of Westeros.

507
00:33:16,655 --> 00:33:19,324
I fear I'm no better than
a servant in this regard.

508
00:33:19,358 --> 00:33:21,426
I cannot give you
what I do not have.

509
00:33:21,461 --> 00:33:24,063
I'm not asking you
for the Kingdoms.

510
00:33:24,097 --> 00:33:25,865
I'm asking you
for ships.

511
00:33:25,899 --> 00:33:27,534
I need to cross
the Narrow Sea.

512
00:33:27,568 --> 00:33:29,436
I need my ships as well.

513
00:33:29,470 --> 00:33:30,937
I use them, you see,

514
00:33:30,972 --> 00:33:33,440
to bring spices from
one port to another.

515
00:33:33,474 --> 00:33:34,974
Whatever you grant me
now will be repaid

516
00:33:35,009 --> 00:33:37,778
three times over when
I retake the Iron Throne.

517
00:33:37,812 --> 00:33:39,246
Retake?

518
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:41,414
Did you once sit
on the Iron Throne?

519
00:33:41,449 --> 00:33:44,284
My father sat there
before he was murdered.

520
00:33:44,318 --> 00:33:46,686
But if you did not
sit on it yourself,

521
00:33:46,721 --> 00:33:50,157
would it not be correct
to say take the Iron Throne?

522
00:33:50,191 --> 00:33:52,225
I didn't come here
to argue grammar.

523
00:33:52,259 --> 00:33:55,128
Of course not.
You came to take my ships.

524
00:33:55,162 --> 00:33:57,730
So let me explain
my position,

525
00:33:57,765 --> 00:33:59,699
little princess.

526
00:33:59,734 --> 00:34:03,202
Unlike you, I do not
have exalted ancestors.

527
00:34:03,237 --> 00:34:05,205
I make my living by trade.

528
00:34:05,239 --> 00:34:08,574
And I judge every trade
on its merits.

529
00:34:08,609 --> 00:34:10,242
You ask for ships.

530
00:34:10,277 --> 00:34:13,312
You say I shall be
repaid triple.

531
00:34:13,346 --> 00:34:16,148
I do not doubt your honesty
or your intentions.

532
00:34:16,182 --> 00:34:18,417
But before you
repay your debts,

533
00:34:18,451 --> 00:34:21,052
you must seize
the Seven Kingdoms.

534
00:34:21,087 --> 00:34:23,754
- Do you have an army?
- Not yet.

535
00:34:23,789 --> 00:34:25,256
You do not have an army.

536
00:34:25,290 --> 00:34:27,391
Do you have powerful
allies in Westeros?

537
00:34:27,426 --> 00:34:29,560
There are many there
that support my claim.

538
00:34:29,595 --> 00:34:31,062
When were you
there last?

539
00:34:32,064 --> 00:34:33,698
I left when
I was a baby.

540
00:34:33,733 --> 00:34:36,635
So, in truth,
you have no allies.

541
00:34:36,670 --> 00:34:39,425
The people will rise
to fight for their rightful

542
00:34:39,450 --> 00:34:41,140
Queen when I return.

543
00:34:41,141 --> 00:34:43,009
Ah.

544
00:34:43,043 --> 00:34:44,811
Forgive me,
little princess,

545
00:34:44,845 --> 00:34:48,282
but I cannot make an investment
based on wishes and dreams.

546
00:34:48,316 --> 00:34:49,783
Now if you'll pardon me.

547
00:34:49,818 --> 00:34:52,519
Do you know Illyrio Mopatis,
Magister of Pentos?

548
00:34:52,554 --> 00:34:55,189
Yes, we've met.
A shrewd man.

549
00:34:55,223 --> 00:34:58,825
For my wedding he gave me
three petrified dragon eggs.

550
00:34:58,860 --> 00:35:01,728
<i>He believed--</i>
<i>the world believed--</i>

551
00:35:01,762 --> 00:35:03,696
that the ages
had turned them to stone.

552
00:35:03,731 --> 00:35:06,933
How many centuries has it been
since dragons roamed the skies?

553
00:35:06,967 --> 00:35:09,935
But I dreamt that
if I carried those eggs

554
00:35:09,969 --> 00:35:12,438
into a great fire,
they would hatch.

555
00:35:12,472 --> 00:35:17,010
When I stepped into the fire,
my own people thought I was mad.

556
00:35:17,044 --> 00:35:19,212
But when the fire
burned out,

557
00:35:19,247 --> 00:35:21,448
I was unhurt,

558
00:35:21,482 --> 00:35:24,318
the Mother of Dragons.

559
00:35:26,888 --> 00:35:29,156
Do you understand?

560
00:35:31,727 --> 00:35:34,295
I'm no ordinary woman.

561
00:35:34,329 --> 00:35:37,297
My dreams come true.

562
00:35:42,070 --> 00:35:44,337
I admire your passion.

563
00:35:45,939 --> 00:35:49,242
But in business, I trust
in logic, not passion.

564
00:35:49,276 --> 00:35:50,943
I'm sorry, little princess.

565
00:35:50,977 --> 00:35:53,312
I am not
your little princess.

566
00:35:53,346 --> 00:35:56,382
I am Daenerys Stormborn
of the blood of old Valyria

567
00:35:56,416 --> 00:35:58,418
and I will take
what is mine.

568
00:35:58,452 --> 00:36:01,554
With fire and blood,
I will take it.

569
00:36:01,588 --> 00:36:05,158
Yes, My Lady,
but not with my ships.

570
00:36:22,575 --> 00:36:25,711
Who taught you to read?

571
00:36:25,745 --> 00:36:28,013
My father, My Lord.

572
00:36:28,048 --> 00:36:30,016
Hmm.

573
00:36:30,050 --> 00:36:32,251
I taught my son
Jaime to read.

574
00:36:35,255 --> 00:36:37,256
The Maester came
to me one day,

575
00:36:37,290 --> 00:36:39,458
told me he wasn't learning.

576
00:36:39,493 --> 00:36:42,261
He couldn't make sense
of the letters.

577
00:36:42,296 --> 00:36:44,998
He reversed them
in his head.

578
00:36:45,032 --> 00:36:47,868
The Maester said he'd heard
tell of this affliction

579
00:36:47,902 --> 00:36:49,937
and that we simply
must accept it.

580
00:36:49,971 --> 00:36:52,039
Ha!

581
00:36:52,074 --> 00:36:55,543
After that,
I sat Jaime down

582
00:36:55,578 --> 00:36:58,747
for four hours every day
until he learned.

583
00:36:58,781 --> 00:37:03,986
He hated me for it,
for a time.

584
00:37:04,021 --> 00:37:06,656
For a long time,

585
00:37:06,691 --> 00:37:08,525
but he learned.

586
00:37:13,297 --> 00:37:16,399
Where is your father?
Is he alive?

587
00:37:19,369 --> 00:37:20,903
Who was he?

588
00:37:20,937 --> 00:37:23,539
A stonemason.

589
00:37:23,573 --> 00:37:25,873
A stonemason
who could read?

590
00:37:25,908 --> 00:37:28,309
- Hmm.
- He taught himself.

591
00:37:28,343 --> 00:37:31,078
Quite a man.

592
00:37:32,113 --> 00:37:34,415
What killed him?

593
00:37:36,017 --> 00:37:38,151
Loyalty.

594
00:37:39,688 --> 00:37:41,856
You're a sharp
little thing, aren't you?

595
00:37:45,227 --> 00:37:46,527
Did...

596
00:37:48,330 --> 00:37:51,666
Forgive me, My Lord.
I shouldn't ask questions.

597
00:37:52,669 --> 00:37:54,936
No...

598
00:37:54,971 --> 00:37:57,873
But you've already begun.

599
00:37:57,907 --> 00:38:01,343
Did you know
your father, My Lord?

600
00:38:01,377 --> 00:38:03,512
I did.

601
00:38:04,948 --> 00:38:06,716
I grew up with him.

602
00:38:08,652 --> 00:38:11,588
I watched him
grow old.

603
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:16,861
<i>He loved us.</i>

604
00:38:16,895 --> 00:38:19,697
He was a good man,

605
00:38:19,732 --> 00:38:22,433
but a weak man,

606
00:38:22,468 --> 00:38:25,970
a weak man who nearly destroyed
our House and name.

607
00:38:28,541 --> 00:38:30,375
I'm cold.

608
00:38:30,410 --> 00:38:33,111
I'll fetch more wood
for the fire, My Lord.

609
00:38:33,146 --> 00:38:35,514
Mmm.

610
00:39:01,975 --> 00:39:03,642
Where are you going, girl?

611
00:39:03,677 --> 00:39:06,612
The armory,
My Lord.

612
00:39:06,647 --> 00:39:08,248
Why?

613
00:39:08,282 --> 00:39:10,116
Lord Tywin sent me.

614
00:39:12,086 --> 00:39:14,354
What might this be?

615
00:39:14,388 --> 00:39:17,290
Lord Tywin gave it to me.

616
00:39:17,324 --> 00:39:19,392
What for?

617
00:39:19,426 --> 00:39:22,261
To take to the armory.

618
00:39:22,296 --> 00:39:24,797
Why would he do that?

619
00:39:26,767 --> 00:39:28,401
Let's go and ask him.

620
00:39:31,004 --> 00:39:33,306
Move!

621
00:39:34,808 --> 00:39:37,277
Get out of the way!

622
00:40:06,941 --> 00:40:08,875
Amory Lorch.

623
00:40:08,909 --> 00:40:10,910
A girl has named
a second name.

624
00:40:10,945 --> 00:40:12,512
A man will do
what must be done.

625
00:40:12,546 --> 00:40:14,481
Now!

626
00:40:14,515 --> 00:40:18,385
A girl cannot tell a man when
exactly he must do a thing.

627
00:40:18,420 --> 00:40:20,688
A man cannot make a thing
happen before its time.

628
00:40:20,722 --> 00:40:22,657
But he's going to tell Tywin.
He's getting away.

629
00:40:22,691 --> 00:40:25,693
It has to be now.

630
00:40:32,869 --> 00:40:34,969
Guard!

631
00:40:44,246 --> 00:40:46,580
- Your Grace.
- Your Grace.

632
00:40:50,452 --> 00:40:52,986
My honor, Your Grace.

633
00:40:53,021 --> 00:40:55,455
Your Grace.

634
00:41:00,528 --> 00:41:03,062
- Your Grace.
- Quent.

635
00:41:24,019 --> 00:41:25,886
Lady Talisa.

636
00:41:26,888 --> 00:41:28,489
Your Grace.

637
00:41:30,259 --> 00:41:32,060
I'm not sure I'm a lady.

638
00:41:32,094 --> 00:41:34,228
Westerosi customs are still
a bit foreign to me.

639
00:41:34,263 --> 00:41:36,664
It's hard to keep
all the rules straight.

640
00:41:36,698 --> 00:41:39,800
But if I remember
my lessons,

641
00:41:39,835 --> 00:41:42,369
a woman of noble birth
is always called a lady

642
00:41:42,404 --> 00:41:44,904
unless she's a queen
or a princess.

643
00:41:44,939 --> 00:41:47,139
I could find
someone who knows.

644
00:41:47,174 --> 00:41:49,742
Why are you so sure
I'm of noble birth?

645
00:41:49,776 --> 00:41:51,810
Because it's obvious.

646
00:41:51,844 --> 00:41:55,480
What if I told you my father
sold lace on the long bridge

647
00:41:55,515 --> 00:41:58,450
and my mother, my brother, and I lived
with him above our shop?

648
00:41:59,952 --> 00:42:01,319
I'd call you a liar.

649
00:42:01,354 --> 00:42:04,756
Not very noble to accuse
a lady of dishonesty.

650
00:42:09,027 --> 00:42:10,895
I always thought
I was a brilliant liar.

651
00:42:11,997 --> 00:42:14,298
Better at amputations,
I'm afraid.

652
00:42:19,403 --> 00:42:20,971
Quite a pretty spot.

653
00:42:21,005 --> 00:42:23,640
Will we be here long?

654
00:42:23,674 --> 00:42:26,409
I couldn't really discuss
troop movements with you.

655
00:42:26,443 --> 00:42:28,878
I'm not a spy.

656
00:42:28,912 --> 00:42:31,980
Of course a spy
would deny being a spy.

657
00:42:33,283 --> 00:42:35,818
You're right.
You've found me out.

658
00:42:35,852 --> 00:42:37,586
I'm writing a letter
to the Lannisters.

659
00:42:37,621 --> 00:42:40,056
"The Young Wolf
is on the move."

660
00:42:41,959 --> 00:42:43,794
Perhaps you'd join me...

661
00:42:45,297 --> 00:42:48,099
If you've got time,
of course, for, well...

662
00:42:48,133 --> 00:42:50,435
Robb.

663
00:42:51,603 --> 00:42:53,738
Mother.

664
00:42:59,511 --> 00:43:02,380
Mother, this is
Lady Talisa.

665
00:43:02,414 --> 00:43:04,682
She's been helping
with the wounded.

666
00:43:04,716 --> 00:43:07,618
She's been very...
helpful.

667
00:43:07,652 --> 00:43:09,186
Lady Talisa.

668
00:43:09,220 --> 00:43:10,887
Lady Stark.

669
00:43:10,922 --> 00:43:12,755
Lady Talisa...?

670
00:43:12,790 --> 00:43:16,359
- Maegyr.
- Maegyr?

671
00:43:16,394 --> 00:43:19,329
Forgive me,
I do not know this name.

672
00:43:19,364 --> 00:43:22,433
An uncommon name here.
An old name in Volantis.

673
00:43:23,502 --> 00:43:26,638
Excuse me, My Lady.
Your Grace.

674
00:43:35,215 --> 00:43:36,883
I've missed you.

675
00:43:36,917 --> 00:43:40,320
Yes, you look
positively forlorn.

676
00:43:40,354 --> 00:43:43,189
You surprised me,
that's all.

677
00:43:43,224 --> 00:43:46,393
I didn't think
I'd see you today.

678
00:43:46,427 --> 00:43:48,795
I wish that you were free
to follow your heart.

679
00:43:48,830 --> 00:43:50,263
I know.

680
00:43:50,298 --> 00:43:52,966
You have inherited your
father's responsibilities.

681
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,802
I'm afraid they come
at a cost.

682
00:43:55,836 --> 00:43:59,239
- I know.
- You are promised to another--

683
00:44:00,141 --> 00:44:03,743
a debt that must be paid.

684
00:44:03,778 --> 00:44:06,146
- I haven't forgotten.
- Your Grace.

685
00:44:06,181 --> 00:44:09,917
My Lady.
News from Winterfell.

686
00:44:22,297 --> 00:44:25,099
Your brothers desert you?

687
00:44:25,133 --> 00:44:27,367
I can tell you
which way to go.

688
00:44:27,402 --> 00:44:30,037
We'll stop here.

689
00:44:30,071 --> 00:44:32,039
Too dark to go
any farther today.

690
00:44:32,073 --> 00:44:34,975
Here? There's no
shelter here.

691
00:44:35,010 --> 00:44:36,410
There's no shelter
anywhere.

692
00:44:36,444 --> 00:44:39,180
There is if you know
where to look.

693
00:44:42,617 --> 00:44:44,585
The cold
could kill us both.

694
00:44:44,619 --> 00:44:46,620
- If you light a fire--
- No fire.

695
00:44:46,654 --> 00:44:49,456
- But a fire is--
- No fire.

696
00:44:52,093 --> 00:44:54,261
Have it your way.

697
00:45:01,169 --> 00:45:03,771
We'll stay warmer
if we stay close.

698
00:45:05,741 --> 00:45:08,309
Bet you freeze to death
before I do.

699
00:45:10,146 --> 00:45:12,581
Bet your life.

700
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:39,175
Think they're out
looking for you?

701
00:45:40,577 --> 00:45:43,346
- Yes.
- Think they'll find you?

702
00:45:43,381 --> 00:45:45,582
Yes.

703
00:45:48,286 --> 00:45:50,320
You're brave.

704
00:45:51,356 --> 00:45:53,189
Stupid,

705
00:45:53,224 --> 00:45:55,125
but brave.

706
00:45:57,762 --> 00:46:01,031
We start again at first light.
Get some sleep.

707
00:46:17,081 --> 00:46:18,848
Stop moving.

708
00:46:18,883 --> 00:46:22,553
I'm just trying
to get comfortable.

709
00:46:22,587 --> 00:46:24,455
Stop it!

710
00:46:36,835 --> 00:46:39,370
- <i>You're still moving.</i>
- Was I?

711
00:46:39,404 --> 00:46:42,006
I didn't notice
that time.

712
00:46:53,083 --> 00:46:54,818
This cannot be true.

713
00:46:54,852 --> 00:46:56,553
<i>We've had ravens</i>
<i>from White Harbor,</i>

714
00:46:56,587 --> 00:46:58,789
Barrowton
and the Dreadfort.

715
00:46:58,823 --> 00:47:00,824
I'm afraid it is true.

716
00:47:01,726 --> 00:47:03,627
Why?
Why would Theon--

717
00:47:03,662 --> 00:47:05,897
Because the Greyjoys
are treasonous whores.

718
00:47:05,931 --> 00:47:08,600
- <i>My brothers?</i>
- We've heard nothing of them.

719
00:47:10,570 --> 00:47:12,872
But Rodrik Cassel is dead.

720
00:47:15,275 --> 00:47:17,576
I told you,
never trust a Greyjoy!

721
00:47:20,581 --> 00:47:22,715
I must go North at once.

722
00:47:22,749 --> 00:47:24,884
There's still a war
to win, Your Grace.

723
00:47:24,918 --> 00:47:27,386
How can I call myself king
if I can't hold my own castle?

724
00:47:27,420 --> 00:47:28,922
How can I ask men
to follow me if I can't--

725
00:47:28,947 --> 00:47:30,656
You are a king.

726
00:47:30,657 --> 00:47:33,492
And that means you don't have
to do everything yourself.

727
00:47:33,527 --> 00:47:35,328
Let me go
and talk to Theon.

728
00:47:35,362 --> 00:47:38,265
There will be no talk.
He will die for this.

729
00:47:38,299 --> 00:47:41,568
Theon holds the castle
with a skeleton crew.

730
00:47:41,602 --> 00:47:43,937
Let me send word to
my bastard at the Dreadfort.

731
00:47:43,971 --> 00:47:48,175
He can raise a few hundred men and
retake Winterfell before the new moon.

732
00:47:48,209 --> 00:47:51,311
We have the Lannisters
on the run.

733
00:47:51,346 --> 00:47:55,983
If you march all the way back north
now, you'll lose what you gained.

734
00:47:56,017 --> 00:47:59,654
My boy would be honored to
bring you Prince Theon's head.

735
00:47:59,688 --> 00:48:04,292
Tell your son Bran and Rickon's
safety is paramount.

736
00:48:04,326 --> 00:48:07,328
And Theon-- I want him
brought to me alive.

737
00:48:08,864 --> 00:48:11,332
I want to look him
in the eye and ask him why.

738
00:48:11,367 --> 00:48:13,968
And then I'll take
his head myself.

739
00:48:14,003 --> 00:48:17,872
Why on earth would I trust the word
of a lying little savage like you?

740
00:48:17,906 --> 00:48:19,807
I'm no liar.

741
00:48:20,943 --> 00:48:22,877
All wildlings
are liars and savages

742
00:48:22,911 --> 00:48:24,746
with no loyalty
to anything or anyone.

743
00:48:24,780 --> 00:48:27,115
I done what I had
to do to stay alive.

744
00:48:27,150 --> 00:48:30,018
I hate the Starks
as well as you do.

745
00:48:30,052 --> 00:48:33,355
Let me serve you,
My Lord.

746
00:48:33,390 --> 00:48:36,192
How? And don't tell me
to put a spear in your hand.

747
00:48:36,226 --> 00:48:38,694
There are other ways
to serve, My Lord.

748
00:48:38,728 --> 00:48:41,263
I'm a prince now,
and you'd do well--

749
00:48:41,298 --> 00:48:44,200
There are other ways
to serve, my prince.

750
00:48:48,673 --> 00:48:50,308
Like what?

751
00:48:52,844 --> 00:48:55,647
We know things,
the free people.

752
00:48:55,681 --> 00:48:58,249
You know things?

753
00:48:58,284 --> 00:49:00,185
Like what?

754
00:49:00,219 --> 00:49:02,487
How to eat dirt?

755
00:49:02,521 --> 00:49:05,523
Other things.

756
00:49:06,692 --> 00:49:09,293
Savage things.

757
00:49:11,296 --> 00:49:13,130
Wait outside.

758
00:49:30,046 --> 00:49:32,248
I always wondered
what you had under there.

759
00:49:32,282 --> 00:49:35,284
It comes at a price.

760
00:49:35,318 --> 00:49:37,586
I'm not killing you.
That's your price.

761
00:49:37,621 --> 00:49:39,188
I already had that.

762
00:49:40,724 --> 00:49:42,191
What do you want, then,

763
00:49:42,225 --> 00:49:44,827
other than
your miserable life?

764
00:49:44,861 --> 00:49:46,963
What all free people want--

765
00:49:46,997 --> 00:49:49,132
my freedom.

766
00:49:54,004 --> 00:49:55,873
Well, you shall
have it, then.

767
00:49:58,142 --> 00:50:00,744
But only if you
serve me well.

768
00:50:06,684 --> 00:50:08,552
- Ow.
- Shh.

769
00:50:08,586 --> 00:50:11,655
- It's not deep.
- I thought they were going to kill me.

770
00:50:11,689 --> 00:50:13,223
They thought so, too.

771
00:50:13,257 --> 00:50:15,893
He hated me,
the man who hit me.

772
00:50:15,927 --> 00:50:18,495
I saw it in his eyes.
Hated me.

773
00:50:18,530 --> 00:50:20,330
He never met me before,

774
00:50:20,365 --> 00:50:23,333
but he wanted
to hurt me.

775
00:50:23,367 --> 00:50:26,403
- Of course he did.
- Why? Why would a stranger--

776
00:50:26,437 --> 00:50:28,705
You are everything
he will never have.

777
00:50:28,739 --> 00:50:30,874
Your horse eats better
than his children.

778
00:50:30,908 --> 00:50:34,244
It doesn't matter now.
He's dead.

779
00:50:34,278 --> 00:50:37,147
I would have given them
bread if I had it.

780
00:50:37,182 --> 00:50:39,783
I hate the King
more than any of them.

781
00:50:39,818 --> 00:50:41,652
Don't say these things.

782
00:50:41,686 --> 00:50:42,953
If the wrong
people hear you--

783
00:50:42,987 --> 00:50:45,289
But you're not
the wrong people.

784
00:50:50,695 --> 00:50:52,863
Don't trust anybody.

785
00:50:52,897 --> 00:50:55,465
Life is safer
that way.

786
00:51:36,309 --> 00:51:39,144
And where
are you going?

787
00:51:40,379 --> 00:51:42,948
I have something for you
from Prince Theon.

788
00:51:42,982 --> 00:51:45,817
- What?
- Me.

789
00:51:48,221 --> 00:51:51,023
He says I'm to make
the rounds.

790
00:51:57,164 --> 00:51:59,665
And keep you warm.

791
00:52:26,693 --> 00:52:30,029
The Spice King refuses me
because I'm a bad investment.

792
00:52:30,063 --> 00:52:31,705
The Silk King won't support me

793
00:52:31,730 --> 00:52:33,730
because of his business with
the Lannisters.

794
00:52:33,733 --> 00:52:35,701
Why offend
his best customer?

795
00:52:35,735 --> 00:52:39,104
And the Copper King
offers me a single ship

796
00:52:39,138 --> 00:52:42,507
on the condition that I lie
with him for a night.

797
00:52:42,541 --> 00:52:45,509
Does he think I will
whore myself for a boat?

798
00:52:45,544 --> 00:52:49,045
When I came to this city,
I had nothing.

799
00:52:49,080 --> 00:52:51,581
Truly nothing.

800
00:52:51,615 --> 00:52:53,683
I slept by the docks.

801
00:52:53,717 --> 00:52:56,452
And when I could find work
loading the ships, I would eat.

802
00:52:56,487 --> 00:52:59,522
If not,
I dreamed of food.

803
00:52:59,556 --> 00:53:02,558
Today I am the richest
man in Qarth.

804
00:53:02,593 --> 00:53:05,027
Do you think the path
from poverty to wealth

805
00:53:05,061 --> 00:53:07,429
is always pure
and honorable?

806
00:53:07,463 --> 00:53:11,099
I have done
many things, Khaleesi,

807
00:53:11,133 --> 00:53:13,635
that a righteous man
would condemn.

808
00:53:13,669 --> 00:53:17,239
And here I am,
with no regrets.

809
00:53:30,088 --> 00:53:33,724
Bar the gates.
Ring the bells.

810
00:53:33,758 --> 00:53:36,426
Slowly, Khaleesi.

811
00:53:45,869 --> 00:53:48,136
<i>Where are they?</i>

812
00:53:54,544 --> 00:53:57,246
Where are my dragons?!

813
