1
00:00:00,601 --> 00:00:02,336
<i>The fist of the First Men.</i>

2
00:00:02,370 --> 00:00:04,605
Thousands of years ago,
the First Men stood here.

3
00:00:04,639 --> 00:00:06,674
They came here to get
away from something.

4
00:00:06,708 --> 00:00:08,177
And I don't think it worked.

5
00:00:08,211 --> 00:00:09,612
Your sword.

6
00:00:09,646 --> 00:00:12,118
<i>The Kingslayer,</i>
<i>he escaped in the night.</i>

7
00:00:12,143 --> 00:00:12,915
How?

8
00:00:12,916 --> 00:00:15,352
Jaime Lannister has
played you for a fool.

9
00:00:15,386 --> 00:00:17,887
Sansa and Arya are captives
in King's Landing.

10
00:00:17,922 --> 00:00:20,658
<i>Returning him may buy</i>
<i>life for my children.</i>

11
00:00:20,692 --> 00:00:23,195
A girl owes one more name.
Give a man a name.

12
00:00:23,229 --> 00:00:26,298
- Jaqen H'ghar.
- A girl gives a man his own name?

13
00:00:26,332 --> 00:00:28,767
I'll un-name you if you help
me and my friends escape.

14
00:00:28,801 --> 00:00:31,870
<i>A girl and her friends will</i>
<i>walk through the gate at midnight.</i>

15
00:00:31,904 --> 00:00:35,274
<i>Who was that out there</i>
<i>hung up at the gates?</i>

16
00:00:35,308 --> 00:00:37,509
Must have been
the farmer's boys.

17
00:00:37,543 --> 00:00:38,777
<i>Killed them, burned them,</i>

18
00:00:38,811 --> 00:00:40,879
<i>and passed them off</i>
<i>as the little lords?</i>

19
00:00:40,913 --> 00:00:43,381
Got as far as the farm
then doubled back.

20
00:00:43,416 --> 00:00:46,017
Hoped this would be the last
place they'd think to look.

21
00:00:46,052 --> 00:00:48,853
My bastard is only a few
days from Winterfell.

22
00:00:48,888 --> 00:00:50,789
- Once he captures the castle--
- Theon has my brothers.

23
00:00:50,823 --> 00:00:53,825
- If we storm the castle--
- he wouldn't dare hurt the boys.

24
00:00:53,860 --> 00:00:56,496
There is only hope of escaping
the North with his head.

25
00:00:56,530 --> 00:00:57,964
Send word to your son.

26
00:00:57,998 --> 00:01:00,134
Any Ironborn
who surrender will be allowed

27
00:01:00,168 --> 00:01:01,902
to return safely
to their homes.

28
00:01:01,936 --> 00:01:04,271
With the exception
of Theon Greyjoy.

29
00:01:04,306 --> 00:01:07,441
I expect his countrymen will turn on
him the minute they hear the offer.

30
00:01:07,476 --> 00:01:09,444
Mance is gonna march
on the wall.

31
00:01:09,478 --> 00:01:11,546
When he does,
one brother inside his army

32
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:13,214
will be worth 1,000
fighting against him.

33
00:01:13,248 --> 00:01:15,149
- They'll never trust me.
- They might.

34
00:01:15,184 --> 00:01:17,118
- If you do what needs to be done.
- What?

35
00:01:17,152 --> 00:01:21,222
I should have known better,
trusting a traitor's bastard!

36
00:01:22,425 --> 00:01:24,759
He's not yours
to kill, crow.

37
00:01:24,794 --> 00:01:26,361
I don't want to marry
the Frey girl.

38
00:01:26,395 --> 00:01:27,929
I don't want you
to marry her.

39
00:01:29,799 --> 00:01:31,933
If you enter that place,
you will never leave again.

40
00:01:31,967 --> 00:01:34,624
If my dragons are in
the House of the Undying,

41
00:01:34,625 --> 00:01:35,430
then take me there.

42
00:01:35,438 --> 00:01:36,972
That's what
the warlock wants.

43
00:01:37,006 --> 00:01:40,476
- His magic is strong.
- And what of my magic?

44
00:01:40,510 --> 00:01:42,512
They're coming ashore.
There are too many.

45
00:01:42,546 --> 00:01:43,813
Rain fire on them.

46
00:01:56,362 --> 00:02:00,133
The battle is over.
We have won.

47
00:02:06,642 --> 00:02:08,810

Pod!

53
00:04:30,496 --> 00:04:32,764
Find Bronn or Varys.

54
00:04:32,799 --> 00:04:36,869
<i>Tell them I am here</i>
<i>with Maester Pycelle.</i>

55
00:04:36,903 --> 00:04:39,706
Tell them I am
very much alive.

56
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:42,676
Yes, My Lord.

57
00:04:42,710 --> 00:04:45,947
Would you like
something for the pain?

58
00:04:47,549 --> 00:04:49,217
What happened?

59
00:04:49,251 --> 00:04:52,020
The murderer and traitor
Stannis Baratheon

60
00:04:52,055 --> 00:04:56,558
suffered a stunning defeat
at the hands of your father.

61
00:04:58,594 --> 00:05:00,194
Where am I?

62
00:05:00,228 --> 00:05:03,130
These are your new chambers.

63
00:05:03,165 --> 00:05:06,100
A little cramped,
perhaps,

64
00:05:06,135 --> 00:05:08,503
but you don't need
much room, do you?

65
00:05:08,537 --> 00:05:12,173
<i>You are no longer</i>
<i>Hand of the King.</i>

66
00:05:16,446 --> 00:05:18,413
Oh.

67
00:05:20,616 --> 00:05:22,217
For your trouble.

68
00:05:46,943 --> 00:05:50,613
<i>I, Joffrey of the House</i>
<i>Baratheon, first of my name,</i>

69
00:05:50,647 --> 00:05:53,048
the rightful King
of the Andals

70
00:05:53,082 --> 00:05:54,849
and the First Men,

71
00:05:54,883 --> 00:05:56,851
Lord of the Seven
Kingdoms

72
00:05:56,885 --> 00:05:58,452
and protector
of the Realm,

73
00:05:58,487 --> 00:06:00,787
<i>do hereby proclaim</i>
<i>my grandfather</i>

74
00:06:00,821 --> 00:06:04,390
<i>Tywin Lannister</i>
<i>the savior of the city</i>

75
00:06:04,425 --> 00:06:06,892
and the Hand of the King.

76
00:06:19,272 --> 00:06:20,973
Thank you, Your Grace.

77
00:06:31,118 --> 00:06:33,586
Lord Petyr Baelish,
step forward.

78
00:06:35,089 --> 00:06:38,291
For your good service
and ingenuity

79
00:06:38,326 --> 00:06:40,894
in uniting the Houses
of Lannister and Tyrell,

80
00:06:40,928 --> 00:06:43,897
<i>I declare that you shall be granted</i>
<i>the castle of Harrenhal...</i>

81
00:06:43,931 --> 00:06:46,633
<i>With all its attendant</i>
<i>lands and incomes</i>

82
00:06:46,667 --> 00:06:48,702
<i>to be held by your sons</i>
<i>and grandsons</i>

83
00:06:48,736 --> 00:06:51,538
from this day until
the end of time.

84
00:06:51,572 --> 00:06:54,140
You honor me
beyond words, Your Grace.

85
00:06:55,910 --> 00:06:59,946
I shall have to acquire
some sons and grandsons.

86
00:07:03,551 --> 00:07:04,952
Ser Loras Tyrell.

87
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:13,494
Your House has come
to our aid.

88
00:07:13,529 --> 00:07:15,230
The whole realm
is in your debt,

89
00:07:15,264 --> 00:07:17,165
none more so than I.

90
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:20,169
If your family would ask
anything of me, ask it

91
00:07:20,203 --> 00:07:22,271
and it shall be yours.

92
00:07:22,305 --> 00:07:24,607
Your Grace,

93
00:07:24,641 --> 00:07:26,176
my sister Margaery,

94
00:07:26,210 --> 00:07:28,812
her husband was taken
from us before...

95
00:07:30,015 --> 00:07:31,916
She remains innocent.

96
00:07:31,951 --> 00:07:34,285
I would ask you to
find it in your heart

97
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:37,388
to do us the great honor
of joining our Houses.

98
00:07:39,358 --> 00:07:42,327
Is this what you want,
Lady Margaery?

99
00:07:44,797 --> 00:07:48,166
With all my heart,
Your Grace.

100
00:07:48,201 --> 00:07:50,869
I have come to love
you from afar.

101
00:07:50,903 --> 00:07:53,405
Tales of your
courage and wisdom

102
00:07:53,439 --> 00:07:55,240
<i>have never been</i>
<i>far from my ears.</i>

103
00:07:55,274 --> 00:08:00,377
And those tales have taken
root deep inside of me.

104
00:08:02,647 --> 00:08:07,717
Well, I too have heard tales
of your beauty and grace,

105
00:08:07,751 --> 00:08:10,086
<i>but the tales</i>

106
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:12,655
do not do you justice,
My Lady.

107
00:08:12,689 --> 00:08:17,594
<i>It would be an honor</i>
<i>to return your love,</i>

108
00:08:17,628 --> 00:08:20,163
but I am promised
to another.

109
00:08:21,299 --> 00:08:22,933
A King must keep
his word.

110
00:08:22,967 --> 00:08:26,837
Your Grace, in the judgment
of your small council,

111
00:08:26,871 --> 00:08:29,039
it would be neither
proper nor wise

112
00:08:29,073 --> 00:08:32,609
for you to wed the daughter
of a man beheaded for treason,

113
00:08:32,643 --> 00:08:35,111
a girl whose brother
is in open rebellion

114
00:08:35,146 --> 00:08:37,413
against the throne
as we speak.

115
00:08:37,448 --> 00:08:39,949
For the good
of the realm,

116
00:08:39,983 --> 00:08:43,185
your councilors
beg you...

117
00:08:44,821 --> 00:08:46,788
to set Sansa Stark aside.

118
00:08:49,691 --> 00:08:53,027
- Margaery!
- We want Margaery!

119
00:08:55,630 --> 00:08:57,431
<i>I would like to heed</i>
<i>your wishes</i>

120
00:08:57,466 --> 00:08:59,901
<i>and the wishes</i>
<i>of my people,</i>

121
00:08:59,935 --> 00:09:02,771
but I took
a holy vow.

122
00:09:02,805 --> 00:09:04,806
<i>Your Grace,</i>

123
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:08,676
the Gods do indeed
hold betrothal solemn,

124
00:09:08,711 --> 00:09:13,148
but your father,
blessed be his memory,

125
00:09:13,182 --> 00:09:16,318
made this pact
before the Starks

126
00:09:16,352 --> 00:09:19,988
revealed their falseness.

127
00:09:20,023 --> 00:09:23,325
<i>I have consulted</i>
<i>with the High Septon</i>

128
00:09:23,359 --> 00:09:27,630
and he assures me that their
crimes against the realm

129
00:09:27,664 --> 00:09:31,500
<i>free you from any promise</i>
<i>you have made to them</i>

130
00:09:31,535 --> 00:09:35,470
<i>in the sight</i>
<i>of the Gods.</i>

131
00:09:35,505 --> 00:09:38,039
The Gods are good.

132
00:09:38,074 --> 00:09:40,576
I am free
to heed my heart.

133
00:09:40,610 --> 00:09:45,147
<i>Ser Loras, I will gladly</i>
<i>wed your sweet sister.</i>

134
00:09:45,181 --> 00:09:46,948
<i>You will be my Queen</i>

135
00:09:46,983 --> 00:09:50,551
and I will love you
from this day

136
00:09:50,586 --> 00:09:52,653
until my last day.

137
00:10:15,146 --> 00:10:18,081
My Lady.

138
00:10:18,115 --> 00:10:20,950
<i>My sincerest condolences.</i>

139
00:10:20,985 --> 00:10:23,419
They're right--
I'm not good enough for him.

140
00:10:23,453 --> 00:10:25,154
You shouldn't say that.

141
00:10:25,188 --> 00:10:27,656
You'll be good enough
for many things.

142
00:10:27,690 --> 00:10:29,924
He'll still enjoy
beating you.

143
00:10:29,992 --> 00:10:32,927
And now that
you're a woman,

144
00:10:32,961 --> 00:10:36,064
he'll be able to enjoy you
in other ways as well.

145
00:10:36,098 --> 00:10:39,067
But if he's not
marrying me--

146
00:10:39,102 --> 00:10:42,371
He'll let you go home?

147
00:10:42,406 --> 00:10:45,809
Joffrey's not the sort of boy
who gives away his toys.

148
00:10:46,811 --> 00:10:48,745
You have a tender heart,

149
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:51,715
just like your mother
did at your age.

150
00:10:51,749 --> 00:10:55,219
I can see so much
of her in you.

151
00:10:55,253 --> 00:10:58,087
She was like
a sister to me.

152
00:10:58,122 --> 00:11:00,990
For her sake,

153
00:11:01,025 --> 00:11:04,193
I'll help get you home.

154
00:11:06,663 --> 00:11:09,730
King's Landing
is my home now.

155
00:11:10,966 --> 00:11:13,167
Look around you.

156
00:11:13,201 --> 00:11:16,336
We're all liars here.

157
00:11:16,371 --> 00:11:19,640
And every one of us
is better than you.

158
00:11:30,919 --> 00:11:33,287
Come in.

159
00:11:33,321 --> 00:11:35,589
Make yourself
comfortable.

160
00:11:41,995 --> 00:11:45,063
That doesn't look
very comfortable.

161
00:11:45,098 --> 00:11:48,099
Here, watch me.

162
00:11:52,004 --> 00:11:53,971
No need for that,
my dear.

163
00:11:54,006 --> 00:11:55,440
You sure?

164
00:11:55,474 --> 00:11:57,442
Most men like
what they see.

165
00:11:57,476 --> 00:11:59,111
I'm not like
most men.

166
00:11:59,145 --> 00:12:01,613
<i>That's what most men say.</i>

167
00:12:01,648 --> 00:12:05,117
If you don't want
what most men want,

168
00:12:05,152 --> 00:12:07,821
then you'd better tell me
what you'd like me to do.

169
00:12:09,290 --> 00:12:12,860
I would like you to tell me
if working for Lord Baelish

170
00:12:12,894 --> 00:12:15,329
has been all you'd
hoped it would be.

171
00:12:16,598 --> 00:12:18,065
Have we met?

172
00:12:18,099 --> 00:12:20,801
You wouldn't
remember me if we had?

173
00:12:20,836 --> 00:12:22,469
I meet a lot of men.

174
00:12:22,504 --> 00:12:24,972
And I think you
remember all of them.

175
00:12:25,006 --> 00:12:28,609
I think your true talents
are wasted on them.

176
00:12:28,643 --> 00:12:31,412
You're very kind,
My Lord.

177
00:12:31,479 --> 00:12:33,880
Allow me to return
the favor.

178
00:12:40,789 --> 00:12:42,756
You're afraid.

179
00:12:42,790 --> 00:12:45,592
Why?
Nothing dangerous down there.

180
00:12:45,627 --> 00:12:48,028
I know who you are.

181
00:12:48,062 --> 00:12:51,231
And, unlike your
current employer,

182
00:12:51,265 --> 00:12:53,967
I protect those
who work for me.

183
00:12:54,002 --> 00:12:57,071
I don't abuse them
to satisfy royal whims

184
00:12:57,105 --> 00:12:59,673
or force them
to abuse each other.

185
00:12:59,708 --> 00:13:01,442
How do you know
about that?

186
00:13:01,476 --> 00:13:04,946
I thought you said
you knew who I was.

187
00:13:06,815 --> 00:13:09,117
What can I do for you,
Lord Varys?

188
00:13:21,863 --> 00:13:23,564
Littlefinger looks at you

189
00:13:23,598 --> 00:13:26,033
and sees a collection
of profitable holes.

190
00:13:26,067 --> 00:13:29,436
I see a potential
partner.

191
00:13:30,805 --> 00:13:34,875
- I'm afraid of him.
- Oh, you should be.

192
00:13:34,909 --> 00:13:37,578
He's a dangerous man.

193
00:13:37,612 --> 00:13:40,881
But everyone has
their weaknesses.

194
00:13:40,915 --> 00:13:45,086
Your current employer
hides his very well,

195
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:47,555
but not as well
as he thinks.

196
00:13:52,028 --> 00:13:54,297
You're a virgin,
I take it?

197
00:13:54,331 --> 00:13:56,398
Walk.

198
00:13:57,701 --> 00:14:00,102
Childhood must have
been awful for you.

199
00:14:00,136 --> 00:14:03,339
Were you a foot taller
than all the boys?

200
00:14:03,373 --> 00:14:06,342
They laughed at you,
called you names?

201
00:14:06,377 --> 00:14:08,645
Some boys
like a challenge.

202
00:14:08,679 --> 00:14:12,116
One or two must have
tried to get inside big Brienne.

203
00:14:12,150 --> 00:14:15,186
- One or two tried.
- Ah.

204
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:17,421
But you fought them off.

205
00:14:17,456 --> 00:14:20,491
But maybe you wished one
of them could overpower you,

206
00:14:20,525 --> 00:14:22,960
fling you down,
tear off your clothes.

207
00:14:22,995 --> 00:14:25,396
But none of them
were strong enough.

208
00:14:25,431 --> 00:14:27,699
- I'm strong enough.
- Not interested.

209
00:14:27,734 --> 00:14:29,268
Of course you are.

210
00:14:29,302 --> 00:14:32,004
You'd love to know what it
feels like to be a woman.

211
00:14:35,108 --> 00:14:38,510
<i>Ah. "They lay</i>
<i>with lions."</i>

212
00:14:38,544 --> 00:14:40,211
Tavern girls, I'd say.

213
00:14:40,246 --> 00:14:43,281
Probably served
my father's soldiers.

214
00:14:43,315 --> 00:14:46,450
Maybe one of them
gave up a kiss and a feel.

215
00:14:46,484 --> 00:14:48,985
That's how
they earned this.

216
00:14:49,020 --> 00:14:52,889
The glorious work of the
northern freedom fighters.

217
00:14:52,923 --> 00:14:55,158
Must make you proud
to serve the Starks.

218
00:14:55,193 --> 00:14:59,163
I don't serve the Starks.
I serve Lady Catelyn.

219
00:14:59,197 --> 00:15:02,099
Tell yourself that tonight
when they swing in your dreams.

220
00:15:06,706 --> 00:15:08,874
- What are you doing?
- Burying them.

221
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:12,345
We shouldn't stay here.
We should get back on the river.

222
00:15:12,379 --> 00:15:14,514
I think these women
would understand if--

223
00:15:14,582 --> 00:15:16,015
I don't care
what you think.

224
00:15:16,049 --> 00:15:17,416
<i>I didn't leave it here.</i>

225
00:15:17,451 --> 00:15:19,552
Untie me now.

226
00:15:19,586 --> 00:15:21,351
<i>I gave it to you to cut</i>
<i>the rope, and now I don't</i>

227
00:15:21,376 --> 00:15:22,754
<i>have me dagger no more.</i>

228
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:25,257
So unless it got stuck in your ass
on its way to your cunt,

229
00:15:25,291 --> 00:15:28,259
it stands to reason
that it's gone-- whoa!

230
00:15:29,661 --> 00:15:31,395
What's your business here?

231
00:15:31,429 --> 00:15:33,396
Traveling a prisoner.

232
00:15:35,934 --> 00:15:39,203
You're a woman.
A woman!

233
00:15:39,238 --> 00:15:41,306
<i>Well, fuck me!</i>

234
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:44,009
If you've quite
finished up--

235
00:15:46,046 --> 00:15:47,913
All right,
we'll be going.

236
00:15:47,948 --> 00:15:50,583
Whoa, whoa.

237
00:15:50,617 --> 00:15:52,318
Who do you fight for?

238
00:15:52,352 --> 00:15:54,820
The Starks.

239
00:15:56,556 --> 00:15:59,024
What did he do?

240
00:15:59,058 --> 00:16:02,160
Apparently eating is now a crime.
Who knew?

241
00:16:02,194 --> 00:16:03,595
No, stealing is a crime.

242
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:06,064
But it's not a crime to starve.
That's justice for you.

243
00:16:06,098 --> 00:16:08,266
- <i>Where are you taking him?</i>
- To Riverrun.

244
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:10,067
Why Riverrun?

245
00:16:10,101 --> 00:16:12,836
Steal from the Tullys,
it's their dungeons you rot in.

246
00:16:12,871 --> 00:16:15,338
- Why not kill him?
- For stealing a pig?

247
00:16:15,373 --> 00:16:17,374
I don't give the orders.

248
00:16:17,408 --> 00:16:18,942
He must be important
to someone.

249
00:16:18,976 --> 00:16:22,145
Sending him with you?
How important could he be?

250
00:16:23,147 --> 00:16:25,916
All right,
have it your way,

251
00:16:25,950 --> 00:16:27,951
m'lady.

252
00:16:30,689 --> 00:16:34,158
- Do I know you?
- Have you been to Ashemark?

253
00:16:34,193 --> 00:16:36,327
- <i>No.</i>
- Then you don't know me.

254
00:16:36,362 --> 00:16:39,497
Do you ever go to the river
market at Salt Rock?

255
00:16:39,532 --> 00:16:42,067
- Is it near Ashemark?
- <i>No.</i>

256
00:16:42,101 --> 00:16:43,502
I've never been there.

257
00:16:43,536 --> 00:16:46,305
What do you think
of these beauties?

258
00:16:47,808 --> 00:16:49,843
I hope you gave them
quick deaths.

259
00:16:49,877 --> 00:16:52,813
Two of them we did, yeah.

260
00:16:54,649 --> 00:16:57,217
Wait.

261
00:16:58,954 --> 00:17:01,488
I do know you.

262
00:17:01,523 --> 00:17:03,490
That's Jaime Lannister.

263
00:17:03,525 --> 00:17:04,968
I wish someone had told me.

264
00:17:04,993 --> 00:17:06,560
I wouldn't have had
to steal that pig.

265
00:17:06,561 --> 00:17:08,896
If this is the Kingslayer,
I think I'd know about it.

266
00:17:08,931 --> 00:17:10,732
How do you know what
the Kingslayer looks like?

267
00:17:10,766 --> 00:17:12,968
I was at Whispering Wood.
I saw him.

268
00:17:13,002 --> 00:17:15,871
<i>They dragged him out of the woods</i>
<i>and threw him down before the King.</i>

269
00:17:15,905 --> 00:17:18,440
He's not the Kingslayer.
Sorry to disappoint you.

270
00:17:18,474 --> 00:17:20,542
If he was, I'd only
be traveling his head.

271
00:17:20,576 --> 00:17:22,711
I have a question
for you both.

272
00:17:22,745 --> 00:17:25,113
And I want you to answer it
at the same time.

273
00:17:25,147 --> 00:17:27,749
<i>I count to three,</i>
<i>you both answer.</i>

274
00:17:27,784 --> 00:17:30,185
What's his name?

275
00:17:30,219 --> 00:17:32,554
One.

276
00:17:32,588 --> 00:17:35,390
<i>Two. Three.</i>

277
00:17:50,272 --> 00:17:52,273
Two quick deaths.

278
00:18:19,999 --> 00:18:22,267
Those were Stark men.

279
00:18:22,301 --> 00:18:25,336
I don't serve the Starks.

280
00:18:25,371 --> 00:18:27,271
I serve Lady Catelyn.

281
00:18:27,305 --> 00:18:29,807
I told her I'd take you
to King's Landing,

282
00:18:29,841 --> 00:18:31,775
and that's what
I'm going to do.

283
00:18:34,045 --> 00:18:35,746
Stay.

284
00:18:53,268 --> 00:18:56,403
Walder Frey is a dangerous
man to cross.

285
00:18:56,437 --> 00:18:58,038
I know that.

286
00:18:58,072 --> 00:19:00,240
And you mean
to do it anyway?

287
00:19:03,945 --> 00:19:06,147
I love her.

288
00:19:06,181 --> 00:19:08,549
I know that seems
important to you.

289
00:19:08,583 --> 00:19:10,517
It is important to me.

290
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:15,755
Your father didn't love
me when we married.

291
00:19:15,790 --> 00:19:19,025
He hardly knew me
or I him.

292
00:19:20,194 --> 00:19:24,164
Love didn't just
happen to us.

293
00:19:24,199 --> 00:19:26,835
We built it slowly
over the years,

294
00:19:26,869 --> 00:19:28,904
stone by stone,

295
00:19:28,938 --> 00:19:31,307
for you, for your
brothers and sisters,

296
00:19:31,341 --> 00:19:33,909
for all of us.

297
00:19:33,943 --> 00:19:37,979
It's not as exciting as
secret passion in the woods,

298
00:19:38,014 --> 00:19:40,916
but it is stronger.

299
00:19:40,950 --> 00:19:43,819
It lasts longer.

300
00:19:43,854 --> 00:19:46,188
And that is what
would be in store for me

301
00:19:46,222 --> 00:19:48,057
with one of
Walder Frey's daughters,

302
00:19:48,092 --> 00:19:50,827
- what you and father had?
- Why not?

303
00:19:50,861 --> 00:19:52,629
Because she's not beautiful?

304
00:19:52,663 --> 00:19:54,665
Because she's not exotic
and exciting?

305
00:19:54,699 --> 00:19:57,802
Now you're arguing just to argue
because you arranged it.

306
00:19:57,836 --> 00:20:00,672
And you agreed to it.

307
00:20:00,706 --> 00:20:02,574
You gave him your word.

308
00:20:02,608 --> 00:20:07,480
Treat your oaths recklessly and
your people will do the same.

309
00:20:07,514 --> 00:20:09,315
If your father lived
his life for one thing--

310
00:20:09,349 --> 00:20:11,551
My father is dead.

311
00:20:11,585 --> 00:20:13,492
And the only parent
I have left has no right

312
00:20:13,517 --> 00:20:15,228
to call anyone reckless.

313
00:20:35,740 --> 00:20:38,475
You said you saw
my victory in the flames.

314
00:20:38,509 --> 00:20:40,543
<i>I did.</i>

315
00:20:40,578 --> 00:20:43,213
- I still see it.
- The flames lied.

316
00:20:44,282 --> 00:20:47,317
And I'm no better
than a savage

317
00:20:47,352 --> 00:20:49,453
trusting in a Fire God.

318
00:20:51,522 --> 00:20:54,524
I fought for your God
in Blackwater Bay.

319
00:20:54,558 --> 00:20:57,860
I led my men to the gates
of the Seventh Hell

320
00:20:57,894 --> 00:21:01,063
as their brothers burned
alive, and for what?

321
00:21:01,097 --> 00:21:04,999
Attacked from behind by
Tywin Lannister and the Tyrells.

322
00:21:05,034 --> 00:21:07,235
If you see so much in your flames,
why didn't you warn me?

323
00:21:07,269 --> 00:21:09,170
The Lord of Light
only allows me glimpses.

324
00:21:09,204 --> 00:21:11,505
You claimed to speak
for a God.

325
00:21:11,539 --> 00:21:13,840
Will you quit the war just
because you've lost a battle?

326
00:21:13,874 --> 00:21:15,776
You talk about war
as if you understand it.

327
00:21:15,810 --> 00:21:18,011
<i>I've been fighting</i>
<i>far longer than you.</i>

328
00:21:18,046 --> 00:21:21,149
Have you?
Show me how you fight.

329
00:21:25,088 --> 00:21:27,790
Show me.

330
00:21:32,563 --> 00:21:35,098
Where's your God now?

331
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:38,701
Will he save you?

332
00:21:38,735 --> 00:21:41,537
Where is your God?

333
00:21:43,774 --> 00:21:46,042
Inside you.

334
00:21:55,317 --> 00:21:57,452
I murdered my brother.

335
00:22:05,763 --> 00:22:08,298
We murdered him.

336
00:22:08,333 --> 00:22:10,067
Share the weight
with me.

337
00:22:10,101 --> 00:22:12,503
He wasn't your brother.

338
00:22:17,242 --> 00:22:19,443
This war
has just begun.

339
00:22:19,478 --> 00:22:21,778
It will last for years.

340
00:22:21,813 --> 00:22:25,182
Thousands will die
at your command.

341
00:22:26,551 --> 00:22:29,954
You will betray
the men serving you.

342
00:22:29,988 --> 00:22:32,823
You will betray
your family.

343
00:22:32,857 --> 00:22:36,426
You will betray everything
you once held dear.

344
00:22:37,862 --> 00:22:40,796
And it will all
be worth it

345
00:22:40,831 --> 00:22:43,900
because you are
the Son of Fire.

346
00:22:43,935 --> 00:22:47,137
You are the Warrior
of Light.

347
00:22:49,006 --> 00:22:52,875
You will sweep aside
this pretender and that one.

348
00:22:54,077 --> 00:22:56,512
You will be King.

349
00:22:59,316 --> 00:23:03,052
You promise
these things, but...

350
00:23:03,087 --> 00:23:05,387
you don't know.

351
00:23:06,390 --> 00:23:08,491
None of us know.

352
00:23:08,526 --> 00:23:10,660
Let me show you.

353
00:23:19,837 --> 00:23:21,737
Look into the fire,
my King.

354
00:23:21,772 --> 00:23:24,106
Look.

355
00:23:25,341 --> 00:23:26,974
I see fire.

356
00:23:27,009 --> 00:23:29,143
Keep looking.

357
00:23:36,218 --> 00:23:38,419
Do you see?

358
00:23:38,454 --> 00:23:41,222
Do you see, my King?

359
00:24:00,175 --> 00:24:02,276
Yes.

360
00:24:12,521 --> 00:24:15,790
I will kill that man.

361
00:24:15,824 --> 00:24:18,460
I don't care how many arrows
they feather me with,

362
00:24:18,494 --> 00:24:20,862
how many spears
they run through me,

363
00:24:20,897 --> 00:24:23,932
I will kill that horn-blowing
cunt before I fall.

364
00:24:23,967 --> 00:24:26,769
They want you to know
you're surrounded.

365
00:24:26,803 --> 00:24:28,804
I know I'm surrounded.

366
00:24:28,839 --> 00:24:31,607
I know that because I stood
on the battlements

367
00:24:31,642 --> 00:24:33,543
and saw I was surrounded.

368
00:24:33,577 --> 00:24:35,311
<i>They don't want</i>
<i>you to sleep.</i>

369
00:24:35,345 --> 00:24:37,247
They want to sap
your spirit before--

370
00:24:37,281 --> 00:24:40,750
Thank you, wise bald man.

371
00:24:40,784 --> 00:24:44,119
Thank you for explaining
siege tactics to me.

372
00:24:47,523 --> 00:24:49,791
No word from my father?

373
00:24:51,627 --> 00:24:53,327
No.

374
00:24:53,361 --> 00:24:55,730
Send more ravens.

375
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:00,002
You killed
all the ravens.

376
00:25:02,606 --> 00:25:05,275
The first time
I saw Winterfell...

377
00:25:10,749 --> 00:25:14,252
The first time
I saw Winterfell,

378
00:25:14,286 --> 00:25:16,197
it looked like something
that had been here for

379
00:25:16,222 --> 00:25:18,222
thousands of years

380
00:25:18,724 --> 00:25:20,858
and would be here
for thousands of years

381
00:25:20,892 --> 00:25:23,126
after I was dead.

382
00:25:24,562 --> 00:25:27,663
I saw it
and I thought,

383
00:25:27,697 --> 00:25:30,332
"of course Ned Stark
crushed our rebellion

384
00:25:30,367 --> 00:25:33,102
and killed my brothers.

385
00:25:33,136 --> 00:25:35,671
We never stood a chance against
a man who lives here."

386
00:25:35,705 --> 00:25:38,408
Lord Stark went out of his way
to make it your home.

387
00:25:38,442 --> 00:25:40,944
Yes, my captors were
so very kind to me.

388
00:25:40,978 --> 00:25:43,346
You love
reminding me of that.

389
00:25:44,549 --> 00:25:47,117
Everyone in this
frozen pile of shit

390
00:25:47,152 --> 00:25:49,687
has always loved
reminding me of that.

391
00:25:52,191 --> 00:25:54,560
You know what it's like
to be told how lucky you are

392
00:25:54,594 --> 00:25:56,595
to be someone's prisoner?

393
00:25:58,598 --> 00:26:01,400
To be told how much
you owe them?

394
00:26:03,836 --> 00:26:07,038
And then to go back home
to your real father...

395
00:26:11,110 --> 00:26:12,711
I will kill that man.

396
00:26:12,745 --> 00:26:14,212
I swear it to
the Drowned God,

397
00:26:14,247 --> 00:26:15,747
the Old Gods,
the New Gods,

398
00:26:15,782 --> 00:26:17,953
to every fucking God
in every fucking heaven,

399
00:26:17,978 --> 00:26:19,851
I will kill that man.

400
00:26:19,852 --> 00:26:22,655
Theon, listen to me.

401
00:26:22,689 --> 00:26:24,857
I serve Winterfell.

402
00:26:24,892 --> 00:26:27,894
Now Winterfell is yours.

403
00:26:27,928 --> 00:26:30,430
I'm bound by oath
to serve you.

404
00:26:30,464 --> 00:26:33,233
And what's your counsel,
trusted friend?

405
00:26:33,268 --> 00:26:35,536
Run.

406
00:26:35,570 --> 00:26:38,098
500 Northmen wait
outside the walls.

407
00:26:38,123 --> 00:26:39,973
You have 20 men.

408
00:26:39,974 --> 00:26:41,908
You can't win.

409
00:26:41,943 --> 00:26:44,110
Wait for nightfall
and run.

410
00:26:44,144 --> 00:26:46,612
There's nowhere to run.

411
00:26:46,646 --> 00:26:48,614
I'd never make it back
to the Iron Islands.

412
00:26:48,648 --> 00:26:51,350
And even if I did,
even if by some miracle

413
00:26:51,384 --> 00:26:54,219
I slipped through the lines
and made it home,

414
00:26:54,253 --> 00:26:56,555
I'd be a coward.

415
00:26:56,590 --> 00:26:59,325
The Greyjoy who ran.

416
00:27:00,727 --> 00:27:03,195
The shame of the family.

417
00:27:04,864 --> 00:27:06,632
Don't go home.

418
00:27:08,334 --> 00:27:10,502
<i>Join the Night's Watch.</i>

419
00:27:12,438 --> 00:27:14,606
Once a man
has taken the Black...

420
00:27:16,609 --> 00:27:19,678
he's beyond reach
of the law.

421
00:27:19,712 --> 00:27:22,814
All his past crimes
are forgiven.

422
00:27:24,851 --> 00:27:26,885
I won't make it
to the Wall.

423
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:30,222
I won't make it 10 feet
past the Winterfell gates.

424
00:27:30,256 --> 00:27:32,424
There are ways.

425
00:27:32,458 --> 00:27:35,293
Hidden passageways built
so the Lords of Winterfell

426
00:27:35,327 --> 00:27:37,696
could escape.

427
00:27:37,730 --> 00:27:40,398
The road will be dangerous.

428
00:27:42,335 --> 00:27:44,603
But with a little luck...

429
00:27:47,607 --> 00:27:52,177
the Night's Watch is an ancient,
honorable order.

430
00:27:53,546 --> 00:27:55,881
You'll have
opportunities there.

431
00:27:57,351 --> 00:28:01,687
The opportunity for Jon Snow
to cut my throat in my sleep.

432
00:28:01,721 --> 00:28:05,758
The opportunity to make
amends for what you've done.

433
00:28:07,728 --> 00:28:10,263
I've done a lot,
haven't I?

434
00:28:11,464 --> 00:28:14,166
Things I never
imagined myself doing.

435
00:28:16,402 --> 00:28:20,472
I've known you many years,
Theon Greyjoy.

436
00:28:22,308 --> 00:28:26,212
You're not the man
you're pretending to be.

437
00:28:28,081 --> 00:28:29,982
Not yet.

438
00:28:33,419 --> 00:28:35,587
You may be right.

439
00:28:37,957 --> 00:28:41,326
But I've gone too far
to pretend to be anything else.

440
00:28:50,904 --> 00:28:53,872
You hear that?

441
00:28:53,906 --> 00:28:57,041
That's the mating call
of the Northmen.

442
00:28:57,075 --> 00:28:59,944
They want to fuck us.

443
00:28:59,978 --> 00:29:02,179
Well, I haven't had
a good fuck in weeks.

444
00:29:02,214 --> 00:29:04,815
I'm ready for one.

445
00:29:04,849 --> 00:29:08,453
They say every Ironborn man is
worth a dozen from the mainland.

446
00:29:08,487 --> 00:29:10,354
Aye!

447
00:29:10,389 --> 00:29:14,392
- You think they're right?
- Aye.

448
00:29:14,426 --> 00:29:18,229
We die today, brothers.

449
00:29:18,263 --> 00:29:21,398
We die bleeding
from 100 wounds

450
00:29:21,433 --> 00:29:26,236
with arrows in our necks
and spears in our guts,

451
00:29:26,271 --> 00:29:30,107
but our war cries will echo
through eternity.

452
00:29:30,141 --> 00:29:33,110
They will sing about
the battle of Winterfell

453
00:29:33,144 --> 00:29:36,046
until the Iron Islands have
slipped beneath the waves.

454
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:40,050
Every man, woman, and child
will know who we were

455
00:29:40,084 --> 00:29:42,819
and how long we stood.

456
00:29:42,854 --> 00:29:44,688
Aggar and Gelmarr;

457
00:29:44,722 --> 00:29:46,223
Wex and Urzen;

458
00:29:46,257 --> 00:29:48,358
Stygg and Black Lorren--

459
00:29:48,393 --> 00:29:51,661
Ironborn warriors
will cry out our names

460
00:29:51,696 --> 00:29:54,998
as they leap onto the shores
of Seagard and Faircastle.

461
00:29:55,032 --> 00:29:56,466
Aye!

462
00:29:56,500 --> 00:29:59,135
- Mothers will name their sons for us.
- Aye!

463
00:29:59,169 --> 00:30:01,837
Girls will think of us
with their lovers inside them.

464
00:30:01,872 --> 00:30:03,405
Aye!

465
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:05,508
And whoever kills
that fucking horn-blower

466
00:30:05,542 --> 00:30:08,611
will stand in bronze
above the shores of Pyke!

467
00:30:08,645 --> 00:30:10,145
Aye!

468
00:30:10,179 --> 00:30:13,014
- What is dead may never die!
- What is dead may never die!

469
00:30:13,049 --> 00:30:15,483
Ah!

470
00:30:18,053 --> 00:30:19,788
Thought he'd never shut up.

471
00:30:19,822 --> 00:30:22,223
It was a good speech.

472
00:30:22,258 --> 00:30:23,958
Didn't want to interrupt.

473
00:30:27,162 --> 00:30:29,230
What is this?

474
00:30:29,264 --> 00:30:31,065
What are you doing?

475
00:30:37,005 --> 00:30:39,073
Let's go home.

476
00:30:41,210 --> 00:30:43,412
<i>Come on.</i>

477
00:30:52,222 --> 00:30:53,690
<i>Why should I believe you?</i>

478
00:30:53,724 --> 00:30:55,291
Why would I lie
about it?

479
00:30:55,325 --> 00:30:58,060
To create strife between
my sister and me.

480
00:30:58,095 --> 00:31:00,864
Where before there was
nothing but love.

481
00:31:00,898 --> 00:31:05,334
Ser Mandon Moore tried to kill
you on your sister's orders.

482
00:31:05,369 --> 00:31:07,870
If it weren't for your
Squire's bravery,

483
00:31:07,904 --> 00:31:10,539
you'd be a dead man.

484
00:31:10,573 --> 00:31:14,309
- <i>Pod.</i>
- Yes, My Lord?

485
00:31:14,344 --> 00:31:16,980
Would it be
excessive of me

486
00:31:17,014 --> 00:31:19,683
to ask you to save
my life twice in a week?

487
00:31:19,717 --> 00:31:21,952
No, My Lord.

488
00:31:21,986 --> 00:31:24,455
<i>You're a good lad.</i>

489
00:31:24,489 --> 00:31:27,291
Get Bronn, tell him I want
four of his most loyal

490
00:31:27,326 --> 00:31:29,261
Gold Cloaks outside
my door at all times.

491
00:31:29,295 --> 00:31:31,630
I'm afraid your friend
has been relieved

492
00:31:31,664 --> 00:31:33,899
of his command
of the City Watch.

493
00:31:33,934 --> 00:31:37,603
The Gold Cloaks are now firmly
in the hands of your father

494
00:31:37,637 --> 00:31:39,371
or your sister.

495
00:31:39,405 --> 00:31:42,208
It varies
from cloak to cloak.

496
00:31:42,242 --> 00:31:45,211
- Then my hill tribesmen.
- Have gone home.

497
00:31:45,245 --> 00:31:48,481
Your father paid them
quite handsomely.

498
00:31:51,518 --> 00:31:54,454
I'm afraid we won't
be seeing each other

499
00:31:54,488 --> 00:31:56,556
for some time, My Lord.

500
00:31:56,590 --> 00:32:00,327
Don't want to swim too close
to a drowning man?

501
00:32:01,395 --> 00:32:03,596
And I thought
we were friends.

502
00:32:03,630 --> 00:32:06,566
We are.

503
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:08,534
Podrick, would you mind?

504
00:32:24,084 --> 00:32:26,418
There are many who know
that without you

505
00:32:26,452 --> 00:32:30,089
this city faced
certain defeat.

506
00:32:30,123 --> 00:32:32,291
<i>The King won't give</i>
<i>you any honors,</i>

507
00:32:32,325 --> 00:32:34,827
<i>the histories</i>
<i>won't mention you,</i>

508
00:32:34,861 --> 00:32:38,063
but we will not forget.

509
00:32:40,534 --> 00:32:42,134
Come along now, Podrick.

510
00:32:46,541 --> 00:32:48,676
My love.

511
00:32:48,710 --> 00:32:50,310
It was good of you
to come.

512
00:32:50,345 --> 00:32:51,946
Good of me?

513
00:32:51,980 --> 00:32:54,015
Of course I come.

514
00:32:58,053 --> 00:33:00,721
- I want to see you.
- Believe me, you don't.

515
00:33:01,823 --> 00:33:03,691
Have you looked?

516
00:33:04,893 --> 00:33:06,626
I will be the first.

517
00:33:30,687 --> 00:33:32,354
Well?

518
00:33:32,389 --> 00:33:35,358
You are a mess.

519
00:33:37,094 --> 00:33:39,762
I'm a monster
as well as a dwarf.

520
00:33:39,796 --> 00:33:41,297
You should charge
me double.

521
00:33:41,331 --> 00:33:43,065
You think I'm here
for money?

522
00:33:43,099 --> 00:33:45,034
That was the arrangement
we made.

523
00:33:45,068 --> 00:33:48,103
I pay you
and you lie to me.

524
00:33:48,137 --> 00:33:50,672
Aw, I'm a poor
little rich man

525
00:33:50,707 --> 00:33:52,647
and nobody loves me,
so I make jokes all the time

526
00:33:52,672 --> 00:33:54,226
and pay them to laugh.

527
00:33:54,777 --> 00:33:56,544
Fuck your money.

528
00:33:57,513 --> 00:33:58,613
Let's leave.

529
00:33:58,648 --> 00:34:00,615
- Leave?
- Leave King's Landing.

530
00:34:00,650 --> 00:34:03,185
They tried to kill you.
They will try again.

531
00:34:03,219 --> 00:34:05,454
Going into wars,
fighting soldiers--

532
00:34:05,489 --> 00:34:07,090
you're terrible at this.

533
00:34:08,692 --> 00:34:11,261
Let's take a boat to Pentos
and never come back.

534
00:34:11,295 --> 00:34:12,896
You don't belong here.

535
00:34:12,931 --> 00:34:14,699
What would we do
in Pentos?

536
00:34:14,733 --> 00:34:17,468
Eat, drink,

537
00:34:17,503 --> 00:34:19,770
fuck, live.

538
00:34:23,843 --> 00:34:26,078
I want to go with you.

539
00:34:26,112 --> 00:34:27,679
So do it.

540
00:34:27,714 --> 00:34:29,948
Your father, your sister,
all these bad people,

541
00:34:29,983 --> 00:34:31,750
they can't stop you.

542
00:34:31,785 --> 00:34:34,219
Forget about them.
Come with me.

543
00:34:36,723 --> 00:34:38,423
I can't.

544
00:34:38,458 --> 00:34:41,292
I do belong here.

545
00:34:42,228 --> 00:34:44,463
These bad people

546
00:34:44,497 --> 00:34:46,131
are what I'm good at.

547
00:34:46,165 --> 00:34:48,567
Outtalking them,
outthinking them.

548
00:34:48,601 --> 00:34:50,903
It's what I am.

549
00:34:52,305 --> 00:34:55,141
And I like it.

550
00:34:55,175 --> 00:34:58,577
I like it more than
anything I've ever done.

551
00:35:03,417 --> 00:35:05,518
Are you going to leave?

552
00:35:11,458 --> 00:35:13,626
You have a shit memory.

553
00:35:16,196 --> 00:35:18,697
I am yours
and you are mine.

554
00:35:30,943 --> 00:35:33,545
In the sight
of the Seven,

555
00:35:33,579 --> 00:35:37,616
I hereby seal
these two souls,

556
00:35:37,650 --> 00:35:42,421
binding them as one
for eternity.

557
00:35:45,791 --> 00:35:50,595
Look upon one another
and say the words.

558
00:35:54,199 --> 00:35:56,233
Father, smith,

559
00:35:56,267 --> 00:35:58,234
warrior, mother,

560
00:35:58,269 --> 00:36:01,805
maiden, crone,
stranger...

561
00:36:01,839 --> 00:36:04,541
- I am hers and she is mine...
- I am his and he is mine...

562
00:36:04,575 --> 00:36:08,078
from this day
until the end of my days.

563
00:37:16,685 --> 00:37:18,886
Is this a riddle?

564
00:37:58,726 --> 00:38:01,194
Khaleesi!

565
00:38:02,163 --> 00:38:04,030
Khaleesi!

566
00:38:06,634 --> 00:38:09,002
<i>Khaleesi!</i>

567
00:38:11,772 --> 00:38:14,907
Are you trying to frighten me
with magic tricks?

568
00:38:14,941 --> 00:38:17,643
You want me?
Here I am.

569
00:38:17,678 --> 00:38:19,746
Are you afraid
of a little girl?

570
00:38:44,204 --> 00:38:46,505
<i>How did he find us?</i>

571
00:39:10,564 --> 00:39:12,565
What are you doing here?

572
00:39:12,599 --> 00:39:14,267
Waiting for you.

573
00:39:14,301 --> 00:39:16,970
How did you know
we'd come this way?

574
00:39:17,004 --> 00:39:18,872
After all the things
you have seen,

575
00:39:18,906 --> 00:39:20,907
this is your question?

576
00:39:20,941 --> 00:39:23,577
How did you
kill those guards?

577
00:39:23,611 --> 00:39:25,979
Was it hard?

578
00:39:26,013 --> 00:39:28,748
No harder than taking a new name
if you know the way.

579
00:39:28,783 --> 00:39:32,419
Show me how. I want
to be able to do it, too.

580
00:39:32,453 --> 00:39:34,621
If you would learn,
you must come with me.

581
00:39:34,656 --> 00:39:36,222
Where?

582
00:39:36,257 --> 00:39:39,459
Far and away across
the Narrow Sea to Braavos.

583
00:39:39,493 --> 00:39:41,561
My dancing master
was from Braavos.

584
00:39:43,063 --> 00:39:44,831
To be a dancing master
is a special thing,

585
00:39:44,866 --> 00:39:47,467
but to be a faceless man--

586
00:39:47,501 --> 00:39:49,436
that is something
else entirely.

587
00:39:49,470 --> 00:39:52,673
A girl has many names
on her lips--

588
00:39:52,707 --> 00:39:55,976
Joffrey, Cersei,
Tywin Lannister,

589
00:39:56,010 --> 00:39:57,844
Ilyn Payne, the Hound.

590
00:39:57,879 --> 00:40:01,315
Names to offer up
to the Red God.

591
00:40:01,349 --> 00:40:05,151
She could offer them all
one by one.

592
00:40:07,288 --> 00:40:09,422
I want to.

593
00:40:11,691 --> 00:40:14,359
But I can't.

594
00:40:14,394 --> 00:40:17,496
I need to find
my brother and mother.

595
00:40:18,398 --> 00:40:20,132
And my sister.

596
00:40:21,701 --> 00:40:23,802
I need to find
her, too.

597
00:40:25,372 --> 00:40:27,272
Then we must part.

598
00:40:27,307 --> 00:40:29,508
A man has duties as well.

599
00:40:29,542 --> 00:40:30,977
Here.

600
00:40:31,011 --> 00:40:32,978
What is it?

601
00:40:33,013 --> 00:40:36,015
A coin of great value.

602
00:40:36,049 --> 00:40:38,484
Could it buy a horse?

603
00:40:38,519 --> 00:40:41,454
It is not meant
for the buying of horses.

604
00:40:41,488 --> 00:40:42,989
Then what good is it?

605
00:40:43,023 --> 00:40:45,858
If the day comes when
you must find me again,

606
00:40:45,893 --> 00:40:47,961
just give that coin
to any man from Braavos

607
00:40:47,995 --> 00:40:49,729
and say these words to him,

608
00:40:49,763 --> 00:40:51,765
"Valar Morghulis."

609
00:40:51,799 --> 00:40:54,334
Valar Morghulis.

610
00:40:58,106 --> 00:41:00,306
Please don't go, Jaqen.

611
00:41:03,477 --> 00:41:05,679
Jaqen is dead.

612
00:41:05,713 --> 00:41:08,682
Say it again.
Valar Morghulis.

613
00:41:08,716 --> 00:41:12,019
Valar Morghulis.

614
00:41:12,053 --> 00:41:14,021
Good.

615
00:41:20,762 --> 00:41:23,230
Farewell, Arya Stark.

616
00:41:47,389 --> 00:41:50,491
Osha, what are you doing?

617
00:43:13,974 --> 00:43:16,643
Tell us what medicine
to get from your chambers.

618
00:43:16,677 --> 00:43:19,413
- We'll make you better.
- I feel just fine.

619
00:43:22,784 --> 00:43:26,253
They burned it down.
They burned everything.

620
00:43:26,288 --> 00:43:29,857
Not everything.
Not you.

621
00:43:32,494 --> 00:43:34,595
But they may come back.
You have to go.

622
00:43:34,629 --> 00:43:36,497
Put on your
warmest clothes.

623
00:43:36,531 --> 00:43:38,966
Pack as much food as you
can carry and go north.

624
00:43:39,001 --> 00:43:40,835
North's the wrong way.

625
00:43:40,869 --> 00:43:42,970
Their mother and brother
are south.

626
00:43:43,004 --> 00:43:44,805
We don't know where.

627
00:43:44,839 --> 00:43:47,641
There are too many enemies
in the South.

628
00:43:47,676 --> 00:43:49,644
Go to the Wall
to Jon.

629
00:43:49,678 --> 00:43:52,546
<i>He'll look after you and let your</i>
<i>mother know you're safe.</i>

630
00:43:52,581 --> 00:43:55,517
I don't want to leave you.

631
00:43:55,552 --> 00:43:58,287
No more than I want
to leave you.

632
00:43:58,321 --> 00:44:02,024
I pulled you
into the world.

633
00:44:02,058 --> 00:44:03,592
Both of you.

634
00:44:03,627 --> 00:44:07,064
I've seen both your faces
almost every day since.

635
00:44:07,098 --> 00:44:12,269
And for that, I consider
myself very, very lucky.

636
00:44:13,639 --> 00:44:15,105
Go now with Hodor.

637
00:44:15,140 --> 00:44:17,207
<i>Go on.</i>

638
00:44:17,242 --> 00:44:19,343
I'll be right here.

639
00:44:21,446 --> 00:44:23,580
Hodor.

640
00:44:26,183 --> 00:44:28,818
Osha.

641
00:44:28,853 --> 00:44:30,853
You must protect them.

642
00:44:30,888 --> 00:44:33,589
You're the only one
who can.

643
00:44:35,659 --> 00:44:38,994
You may have to protect
them against your own kind.

644
00:44:39,028 --> 00:44:41,897
I've got no great love
for my own kind.

645
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:46,834
I'll get you milk
of the poppy.

646
00:44:46,869 --> 00:44:48,703
Tell me where to find it.

647
00:44:48,737 --> 00:44:51,438
I don't want
milk of the poppy.

648
00:45:01,717 --> 00:45:03,384
Do it quickly.

649
00:50:55,640 --> 00:50:58,241
Until the sun
rises in the west

650
00:50:58,275 --> 00:51:01,844
and sets in the east,

651
00:51:01,878 --> 00:51:04,580
until the rivers run dry

652
00:51:04,614 --> 00:51:07,783
and the mountains blow
in the wind like leaves.

653
00:51:49,559 --> 00:51:52,427
They miss their mother.

654
00:51:52,461 --> 00:51:54,862
They want to be with you.

655
00:51:54,897 --> 00:51:56,664
Do you want
to be with them?

656
00:51:56,698 --> 00:51:58,499
You will be.

657
00:51:58,534 --> 00:52:00,902
<i>When your dragons</i>
<i>were born,</i>

658
00:52:00,937 --> 00:52:02,938
our magic
was born again.

659
00:52:02,972 --> 00:52:04,907
It is strongest
in their presence.

660
00:52:04,941 --> 00:52:08,844
And they are strongest
in yours.

661
00:52:08,879 --> 00:52:11,914
You will be with them,

662
00:52:11,949 --> 00:52:14,884
through winter, summer,

663
00:52:14,919 --> 00:52:17,220
and winter again.

664
00:52:17,254 --> 00:52:20,089
Across a thousand
thousand seasons

665
00:52:20,124 --> 00:52:21,924
you will be with them.

666
00:52:21,958 --> 00:52:25,160
And we will be with you
until time comes to an end.

667
00:52:30,933 --> 00:52:34,402
Welcome home,
Daenerys Stormborn.

668
00:52:34,436 --> 00:52:36,537
This is not my home.

669
00:52:36,571 --> 00:52:37,612
My home is across the sea

670
00:52:37,637 --> 00:52:39,717
where my people
are waiting for me.

671
00:52:39,841 --> 00:52:42,477
They will be waiting
a long time.

672
00:52:59,930 --> 00:53:02,064
Dracarys.

673
00:53:49,914 --> 00:53:52,415
We should be there
by sundown.

674
00:53:52,450 --> 00:53:54,150
Won't be a fun
night for you.

675
00:53:54,184 --> 00:53:57,153
Mance knows how
to make crows sing.

676
00:53:59,490 --> 00:54:01,198
If you know what to say,
you might just make it

677
00:54:01,223 --> 00:54:02,834
through the night.

678
00:54:05,429 --> 00:54:08,498
Not talking's
not the way to go.

679
00:54:08,532 --> 00:54:11,367
Careful with that.

680
00:54:11,401 --> 00:54:13,669
You might cut yourself.

681
00:54:13,704 --> 00:54:16,439
Never swung a sword
before, have you?

682
00:54:16,473 --> 00:54:18,241
You look like a baby
with a rattle.

683
00:54:18,275 --> 00:54:20,609
<i>Enough of that!</i>

684
00:54:30,187 --> 00:54:32,221
- Stop!
- Why, traitor?

685
00:54:32,255 --> 00:54:36,058
So you can give Mance Rayder
an invitation to Castle Black?

686
00:54:36,092 --> 00:54:38,293
Let 'em fight.

687
00:54:57,780 --> 00:55:00,215
That's it?
That's what you can do?

688
00:55:00,249 --> 00:55:02,317
You little shit.

689
00:55:07,224 --> 00:55:09,458
Your traitor father
teach you that?

690
00:55:12,963 --> 00:55:15,064
Or was it your whore mother?

691
00:55:33,417 --> 00:55:37,219
We are the Watchers
on the Wall.

692
00:55:49,835 --> 00:55:51,737
You can tell Mance

693
00:55:51,771 --> 00:55:55,541
that's the man who killed
Qhorin Halfhand.

694
00:56:09,556 --> 00:56:11,891
- Burn the body.
<i>- Aye.</i>

695
00:56:11,925 --> 00:56:14,260
You don't want this one
coming back for you.

696
00:56:28,041 --> 00:56:30,242
Come along, Jon Snow.

697
00:56:55,902 --> 00:56:58,937
Time to meet
the King-Beyond-The-Wall.

698
00:57:45,020 --> 00:57:47,154
What the--?

699
00:57:52,560 --> 00:57:55,328
<i>Khaleesi, please.</i>

700
00:57:55,363 --> 00:57:57,264
He said you'd never
leave Qarth alive.

701
00:57:57,298 --> 00:57:59,499
Come.

702
00:58:30,165 --> 00:58:31,999
Nothing.

703
00:58:39,240 --> 00:58:42,576
Thank you,
Xaro Xhoan Daxos.

704
00:58:42,610 --> 00:58:45,746
<i>Thank you for teaching</i>
<i>me this lesson.</i>

705
00:58:48,483 --> 00:58:50,017
I am King of Qarth.

706
00:58:50,051 --> 00:58:52,019
I can help you now,
truly help you.

707
00:58:52,053 --> 00:58:54,154
We can take
the Iron Throne.

708
00:58:54,189 --> 00:58:56,390
- I'll bring you 1,000 ships.
- Please, Khaleesi, I beg you.

709
00:58:56,424 --> 00:58:58,892
All that you have dreamed
is within your reach!

710
00:58:58,927 --> 00:59:01,695
I beg you, please!

711
00:59:01,730 --> 00:59:04,598
- Khaleesi.
- Please! Please!

712
00:59:04,632 --> 00:59:07,835
<i>- Khaleesi!</i>

713
00:59:26,154 --> 00:59:28,923
It's all a lie.

714
00:59:28,957 --> 00:59:31,259
Looks real enough to me.

715
00:59:35,531 --> 00:59:37,765
Real enough
to buy a ship?

716
00:59:39,134 --> 00:59:42,036
Aye, a small ship.

717
01:00:25,980 --> 01:00:29,116
I thought we were coming
north to fight wildlings.

718
01:00:32,187 --> 01:00:34,554
Is this goat?

719
01:00:34,589 --> 01:00:36,123
It's moose.

720
01:00:36,157 --> 01:00:38,258
People shouldn't
live anywhere

721
01:00:38,292 --> 01:00:40,327
you need to burn shit
to keep warm.

722
01:00:40,361 --> 01:00:44,498
Well, you see a tree,
let me know.

723
01:00:46,401 --> 01:00:48,568
If you step back
and think about it,

724
01:00:48,603 --> 01:00:50,971
the thing about Gilly
that's so interesting is--

725
01:00:51,005 --> 01:00:53,273
- Just bloody kill me.
- No, truly.

726
01:00:53,308 --> 01:00:56,510
The thing about her that
I find so interesting is that

727
01:00:56,544 --> 01:00:59,079
after all that
Craster's done to her,

728
01:00:59,113 --> 01:01:01,615
she's still got hope that
life might get better.

729
01:01:01,649 --> 01:01:04,884
The thing about Gilly
that you find so interesting

730
01:01:04,918 --> 01:01:07,687
is that she said
six words to you.

731
01:01:07,721 --> 01:01:10,856
And the thing about you
that I find so interesting

732
01:01:10,891 --> 01:01:12,858
is absolutely nothing.

733
01:01:15,695 --> 01:01:17,829
It's Jon
and the Halfhand.

734
01:01:17,863 --> 01:01:20,698
They're back.

735
01:01:23,135 --> 01:01:26,004
Two blasts is wildlings.

736
01:01:26,038 --> 01:01:28,072
You're not fighting them alone.
Come on.

737
01:01:33,079 --> 01:01:34,980
Three blasts?

738
01:01:35,014 --> 01:01:37,115
Run!

739
01:01:42,822 --> 01:01:45,524
Wait! Wait for me!

740
01:01:48,929 --> 01:01:50,363
Grenn!

741
01:01:51,598 --> 01:01:53,766
<i>Edd!</i>
