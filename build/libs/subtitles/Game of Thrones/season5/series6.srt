1
00:00:01,569 --> 00:00:03,926
My son Jorah, 
fled Westeros.

2
00:00:03,950 --> 00:00:06,082
He brought dishonor
to our House.

3
00:00:06,106 --> 00:00:09,057
I need to turn this bunch
of thieves and runaways

4
00:00:09,081 --> 00:00:10,576
into men
of The Night's Watch.

5
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:12,536
And how's that going,
commander Mormont?

6
00:00:13,529 --> 00:00:15,185
I shall have
your head for this!

7
00:00:18,238 --> 00:00:20,192
You're taking us
through Valyria.

8
00:00:20,374 --> 00:00:22,501
The Doom
still rules Valyria.

9
00:00:25,708 --> 00:00:27,331
- ( rasping )
- Stone Men!

10
00:00:31,069 --> 00:00:32,557
Don't let them
touch you!

11
00:00:33,222 --> 00:00:34,640
You?

12
00:00:37,847 --> 00:00:39,390
The Eyrie is mine.

13
00:00:40,259 --> 00:00:41,808
The last time
the lords of the Eyrie

14
00:00:41,832 --> 00:00:43,921
formed an alliance
with the lords of the North,

15
00:00:43,945 --> 00:00:46,784
they brought down the greatest dynasty
this world has ever known.

16
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:50,776
Cersei sent for me.

17
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:53,665
I expect I'll be a married woman
by the time you return.

18
00:00:54,081 --> 00:00:55,752
I hope I can
make her happy.

19
00:00:55,776 --> 00:00:56,878
She's suffered enough.

20
00:00:56,902 --> 00:00:58,540
I'll never hurt her.

21
00:00:59,005 --> 00:01:01,356
All sinners are equal
before the gods.

22
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:05,215
What would you say if I told you
of a great sinner in our very midst?

23
00:01:05,773 --> 00:01:08,028
May the Father
judge him justly.

24
00:01:08,204 --> 00:01:09,282
Who do you
think you are?

25
00:01:09,306 --> 00:01:10,760
Justice.

26
00:01:11,327 --> 00:01:12,607
Your brother was murdered

27
00:01:12,631 --> 00:01:15,354
while you sit here
and doing nothing.

28
00:01:15,378 --> 00:01:16,835
The Sand Snakes are with me.

29
00:01:16,859 --> 00:01:19,639
Without Doran, we have no
army to march against the Lannisters.

30
00:01:19,789 --> 00:01:22,347
<i>Queen Cersei loves</i>
<i>her children.</i>

31
00:01:22,371 --> 00:01:23,615
And we have one of them.

32
00:01:23,697 --> 00:01:26,434
We're rescuing my niece,
bringing her back to her family.

33
00:01:26,458 --> 00:01:27,942
You ever been to Dorne?

34
00:01:31,101 --> 00:01:32,593
The Dornish are crazy.

35
00:01:32,617 --> 00:01:34,376
If he gets to her
before we do,

36
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:36,511
we lose our only chance
for revenge.

37
00:01:38,348 --> 00:01:40,302
Here we serve
the Many-Faced God.

38
00:01:40,326 --> 00:01:41,521
To serve well,

39
00:01:41,545 --> 00:01:43,302
a girl must become
no one.

40
00:01:43,326 --> 00:01:45,230
What do we do with them
after we wash them?

41
00:01:53,039 --> 00:01:57,039
<i><font color=#FFFF00>? Theme music playing  ?</font></i>

What are they doing
with the bodies?

48
00:05:42,201 --> 00:05:44,002
Get back to work.

49
00:05:44,036 --> 00:05:46,638
No. I've been here
for weeks.

50
00:05:46,672 --> 00:05:48,139
I'm not scrubbing
one more corpse

51
00:05:48,173 --> 00:05:50,675
until you tell me
why I'm doing it.

52
00:05:50,709 --> 00:05:52,610
You will know why.

53
00:05:52,678 --> 00:05:56,915
- When?
- When it's time, not before.

54
00:05:56,949 --> 00:05:58,416
Get back to work.

55
00:05:58,450 --> 00:05:59,918
When do I get
to play the game?

56
00:05:59,952 --> 00:06:01,586
Game?

57
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:04,222
The game.
The Game of Faces.

58
00:06:04,256 --> 00:06:07,659
You tried already.
You failed.

59
00:06:07,693 --> 00:06:09,093
I didn't even know
I was playing.

60
00:06:09,128 --> 00:06:11,529
Who are you?

61
00:06:11,564 --> 00:06:13,197
No one.

62
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:15,733
Get back to work.

63
00:06:15,768 --> 00:06:17,235
Who are you?

64
00:06:17,303 --> 00:06:20,505
What are you doing here?
How did you get here?

65
00:06:21,707 --> 00:06:25,043
I'm from Westeros
just like you.

66
00:06:26,245 --> 00:06:28,813
Daughter of a lord
just like you.

67
00:06:29,915 --> 00:06:31,649
Except I was
an only child.

68
00:06:31,684 --> 00:06:34,886
Heir to his fortune.

69
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:37,488
My mother died.

70
00:06:37,523 --> 00:06:39,757
My father remarried
and his new wife

71
00:06:39,858 --> 00:06:42,660
gave birth to a girl.

72
00:06:42,695 --> 00:06:47,231
My stepmother didn't want any rivals
for her precious daughter,

73
00:06:47,299 --> 00:06:49,300
so she tried
to kill me with poison.

74
00:06:49,335 --> 00:06:51,569
I found out.

75
00:06:51,604 --> 00:06:53,838
Sought help from
the Faceless Men.

76
00:06:56,041 --> 00:06:58,743
And my father
was widowed again.

77
00:07:00,412 --> 00:07:02,780
I've been serving them
ever since.

78
00:07:13,993 --> 00:07:17,261
Was that true
or a lie?

79
00:07:19,965 --> 00:07:21,432
What?

80
00:07:21,467 --> 00:07:23,267
Did you believe
every word I said?

81
00:07:23,302 --> 00:07:26,104
<i>( footsteps approaching )</i>

82
00:07:28,107 --> 00:07:29,674
Get back to work.

83
00:07:44,289 --> 00:07:46,324
Jaqen:
<i>Who are you?</i>

84
00:07:55,868 --> 00:07:57,902
Who are you?

85
00:08:02,875 --> 00:08:04,342
Arya.

86
00:08:05,511 --> 00:08:07,645
And where did you
come from?

87
00:08:07,713 --> 00:08:09,147
<i>Westeros.</i>

88
00:08:13,285 --> 00:08:15,253
My family home
is Winterfell.

89
00:08:15,287 --> 00:08:17,922
I'm the youngest daughter
of a great lord,

90
00:08:17,924 --> 00:08:19,090
Eddard Stark.

91
00:08:19,158 --> 00:08:21,198
He died in battle.

92
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:23,428
A lie.

93
00:08:23,462 --> 00:08:26,497
After he was executed,
I fled the capital.

94
00:08:27,866 --> 00:08:29,767
Had to kill a stable boy.

95
00:08:29,802 --> 00:08:31,569
Drove my sword
through his back.

96
00:08:31,637 --> 00:08:33,037
( gasps )

97
00:08:33,072 --> 00:08:34,706
A lie.

98
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:36,674
I stabbed him
in the gut.

99
00:08:36,709 --> 00:08:39,243
<i>I tried to find</i>
<i>my mother and brother,</i>

100
00:08:39,278 --> 00:08:40,912
<i>but I never did.</i>

101
00:08:40,979 --> 00:08:43,347
<i>They were murdered</i>
<i>by Walder Frey.</i>

102
00:08:44,783 --> 00:08:46,984
An outlaw kidnapped me,
a man called Polliver.

103
00:08:47,019 --> 00:08:48,920
( winces )

104
00:08:48,954 --> 00:08:52,423
A man called the Hound.
Sandor Clegane.

105
00:08:52,458 --> 00:08:54,559
He tried to sell me,
but was wounded in a fight.

106
00:08:54,593 --> 00:08:56,594
He begged me to kill him,
but I wouldn't.

107
00:08:56,628 --> 00:08:58,730
I left him
in the mountains to die.

108
00:08:58,764 --> 00:09:01,232
I wanted him to suffer.
I hated him.

109
00:09:03,335 --> 00:09:04,802
I hated him.

110
00:09:06,472 --> 00:09:09,240
That's not a lie!

111
00:09:09,274 --> 00:09:12,276
A girl lies to me,

112
00:09:12,311 --> 00:09:15,747
to the Many-Faced God,
to herself.

113
00:09:15,781 --> 00:09:17,949
Does she truly
want to be no one?

114
00:09:18,016 --> 00:09:20,184
Yes.

115
00:09:20,219 --> 00:09:22,153
( whimpers )

116
00:09:25,224 --> 00:09:28,192
I'm not playing
this stupid game anymore!

117
00:09:28,227 --> 00:09:30,394
We never stop playing.

118
00:09:52,684 --> 00:09:56,320
So, those villages
we were supposed to find?

119
00:09:56,355 --> 00:09:58,189
We can't live on
berries and roots.

120
00:09:58,223 --> 00:10:00,925
I can.

121
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:02,760
You're not hungry?

122
00:10:02,795 --> 00:10:05,062
Of course
I'm hungry.

123
00:10:05,164 --> 00:10:07,632
You're an awful travelling companion,
do you know that?

124
00:10:07,666 --> 00:10:09,901
Possibly the least
charming man I've ever met.

125
00:10:09,935 --> 00:10:11,569
I'm not your travelling
companion.

126
00:10:11,603 --> 00:10:14,906
We are travelling together
in each other's company, therefore--

127
00:10:14,973 --> 00:10:16,841
Do you ever shut up?

128
00:10:17,275 --> 00:10:20,411
I sailed from King's Landing
to Pentos in a crate

129
00:10:20,445 --> 00:10:22,913
<i>without ever</i>
<i>saying a word.</i>

130
00:10:22,948 --> 00:10:24,648
Why?

131
00:10:27,752 --> 00:10:30,754
It never occurred to you
to ask why until now?

132
00:10:33,058 --> 00:10:35,025
You never wondered
why Tyrion Lannister

133
00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:37,761
decided to visit
a brothel in Volantis?

134
00:10:37,796 --> 00:10:40,764
I'm sure you visited many brothels
in many cities.

135
00:10:42,867 --> 00:10:44,568
I killed my father.

136
00:10:47,138 --> 00:10:50,474
He wanted to execute me
for a crime I didn't commit.

137
00:10:53,078 --> 00:10:55,346
And he was fucking
the woman I loved.

138
00:11:05,991 --> 00:11:07,524
As miserable
as you are, Mormont,

139
00:11:07,559 --> 00:11:09,093
at least your father
was a good man.

140
00:11:09,127 --> 00:11:10,928
What do you know
about my father?

141
00:11:10,962 --> 00:11:14,531
I met him.
I visited the Wall.

142
00:11:14,566 --> 00:11:17,501
When I asked him
about his men,

143
00:11:17,535 --> 00:11:19,737
he knew all their stories,
every one of them.

144
00:11:19,771 --> 00:11:23,374
He actually cared about the people
under his command.

145
00:11:23,441 --> 00:11:26,810
How do they put it
in the Watch?

146
00:11:26,845 --> 00:11:29,580
"We shall never see
his like again."

147
00:11:39,257 --> 00:11:42,760
Oh, you didn't know.

148
00:11:48,166 --> 00:11:51,135
I'm sorry.
I am.

149
00:11:53,505 --> 00:11:54,972
How?

150
00:11:56,508 --> 00:11:58,342
I only know
what I heard.

151
00:11:58,376 --> 00:11:59,543
How?

152
00:11:59,611 --> 00:12:02,146
<i>He was leading</i>
<i>an expedition beyond the Wall.</i>

153
00:12:03,081 --> 00:12:05,749
There was a mutiny.

154
00:12:05,784 --> 00:12:08,052
He was murdered
by his own men.

155
00:12:19,664 --> 00:12:21,932
We better keep moving.

156
00:12:37,916 --> 00:12:40,617
<i>( girl coughing )</i>

157
00:12:56,801 --> 00:12:59,636
( labored breathing )

158
00:13:11,383 --> 00:13:12,950
Valar morghulis.

159
00:13:13,017 --> 00:13:15,085
Valar dohaeris.

160
00:13:16,521 --> 00:13:18,822
I have nowhere
else to go.

161
00:13:18,857 --> 00:13:22,526
I've taken her
to every healer in Braavos.

162
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:25,529
I've spent
every penny I had.

163
00:13:27,031 --> 00:13:30,601
( labored breathing )

164
00:13:30,635 --> 00:13:33,670
She suffers every day
of her life.

165
00:13:33,705 --> 00:13:36,673
I just want it to end.

166
00:14:04,569 --> 00:14:06,270
It hurts.

167
00:14:06,304 --> 00:14:08,672
I know.

168
00:14:10,775 --> 00:14:13,243
Don't be afraid.

169
00:14:13,278 --> 00:14:16,680
I used to be like you.

170
00:14:16,714 --> 00:14:18,849
I was sick.

171
00:14:20,118 --> 00:14:22,119
I was dying.

172
00:14:24,956 --> 00:14:28,659
But my father
never gave up on me.

173
00:14:31,062 --> 00:14:33,864
He loved me

174
00:14:33,898 --> 00:14:35,499
more than anything
in the world,

175
00:14:35,533 --> 00:14:38,268
just like your father
loves you.

176
00:14:38,303 --> 00:14:41,572
So he brought me here.

177
00:14:41,606 --> 00:14:44,274
My father prayed
to the Many-Faced God.

178
00:14:46,377 --> 00:14:48,512
And I drank the water
from his fountain.

179
00:14:49,814 --> 00:14:51,648
It healed me.

180
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:57,721
<i>( bowl scrapes )</i>

181
00:15:04,295 --> 00:15:06,864
I've devoted my life
to him now.

182
00:15:08,366 --> 00:15:10,400
You don't want
to hurt anymore?

183
00:15:12,637 --> 00:15:14,338
Drink.

184
00:17:58,636 --> 00:18:00,604
Jaqen:
<i>Is a girl ready?</i>

185
00:18:02,273 --> 00:18:05,142
To give up her ears,
her nose, her tongue?

186
00:18:06,711 --> 00:18:09,613
<i>Her hopes and dreams,</i>
<i>her loves and hates?</i>

187
00:18:09,647 --> 00:18:12,449
All that makes a girl
who she is?

188
00:18:13,551 --> 00:18:15,719
Forever?

189
00:18:18,856 --> 00:18:21,258
No.

190
00:18:21,292 --> 00:18:24,428
A girl is not ready
to become no one.

191
00:18:29,934 --> 00:18:32,602
But she is ready
to become someone else.

192
00:18:45,883 --> 00:18:48,919
Why Daenerys?
Why is she worth all this?

193
00:18:50,621 --> 00:18:53,757
As I recall, the Mormonts fought
against the Targaryens

194
00:18:53,791 --> 00:18:55,692
during Robert's
Rebellion.

195
00:18:55,727 --> 00:18:57,861
Do you believe
in anything?

196
00:18:57,895 --> 00:18:59,563
I believe
in lots of things.

197
00:18:59,630 --> 00:19:01,531
In something greater
than ourselves, I mean.

198
00:19:01,566 --> 00:19:03,667
The gods, destiny.

199
00:19:03,701 --> 00:19:06,903
Do you believe there's
a plan for this world?

200
00:19:06,971 --> 00:19:09,406
No.

201
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:10,707
Neither did I.

202
00:19:10,742 --> 00:19:13,110
I was a cynic
just like you.

203
00:19:13,144 --> 00:19:16,279
Then I saw a girl
step into a great fire

204
00:19:16,314 --> 00:19:18,215
with three stone eggs.

205
00:19:18,249 --> 00:19:21,051
When the fire burned out,
I thought I'd find her blackened bones.

206
00:19:21,085 --> 00:19:25,188
Instead, I saw her,
Daenerys,

207
00:19:25,223 --> 00:19:29,226
alive and unhurt,
holding her baby dragons.

208
00:19:31,562 --> 00:19:34,331
Have you ever heard
baby dragons singing?

209
00:19:34,398 --> 00:19:36,099
No.

210
00:19:36,134 --> 00:19:38,602
It's hard to be
a cynic after that.

211
00:19:40,505 --> 00:19:42,773
Doesn't mean she's going
to be a great queen.

212
00:19:42,807 --> 00:19:44,708
<i>No, it doesn't.</i>

213
00:19:44,742 --> 00:19:47,010
The Targaryens
are famously insane.

214
00:19:47,044 --> 00:19:49,946
What if she conquers the world?
Then what?

215
00:19:49,981 --> 00:19:52,249
1,000 years of peace
and prosperity?

216
00:19:52,283 --> 00:19:54,284
First we have
to conquer the world.

217
00:19:54,318 --> 00:19:56,186
We?

218
00:19:56,220 --> 00:19:58,421
All right, let's assume
your dreams come true.

219
00:19:58,489 --> 00:20:01,792
<i>She's ecstatic when you</i>
<i>bring her this enemy dwarf.</i>

220
00:20:01,826 --> 00:20:04,995
<i>She hacks off my head</i>
<i>and restores your position.</i>

221
00:20:05,029 --> 00:20:07,330
You command her army,
sail to Westeros,

222
00:20:07,365 --> 00:20:10,300
defeat all your enemies
and watch her climb those steps

223
00:20:10,334 --> 00:20:11,802
and sit on
the Iron Throne.

224
00:20:11,836 --> 00:20:14,104
Hurrah.
Long live the queen. Then what?

225
00:20:14,138 --> 00:20:15,739
Then she rules.

226
00:20:15,773 --> 00:20:18,942
So a woman who has not
spent a single day of her adult life

227
00:20:18,976 --> 00:20:21,678
in Westeros becomes
the ruler of Westeros? That's justice?

228
00:20:21,712 --> 00:20:24,281
- She's the rightful heir.
- Why?

229
00:20:24,315 --> 00:20:28,151
Because her father, who burned living men
for amusement, was the king?

230
00:20:31,522 --> 00:20:33,824
- That's a slave ship.
- Why are they anchored?

231
00:20:33,858 --> 00:20:35,659
They probably
came ashore for--

232
00:20:35,693 --> 00:20:38,161
- <i>( swords scraping )</i>
- Man: <i>Water.</i>

233
00:20:45,570 --> 00:20:48,705
- ( grunts )
- ( man laughs )

234
00:20:48,739 --> 00:20:51,508
Got a lot of fight
in you, huh?

235
00:20:52,443 --> 00:20:53,910
( grunts )

236
00:20:53,978 --> 00:20:56,446
( chuckles )

237
00:20:59,750 --> 00:21:01,818
Salt mines?

238
00:21:01,886 --> 00:21:05,121
Yeah, that
or a galley slave.

239
00:21:05,156 --> 00:21:07,023
<i>He looks strong enough.</i>

240
00:21:07,058 --> 00:21:09,860
What about the dwarf?

241
00:21:09,894 --> 00:21:12,195
Worthless.

242
00:21:12,230 --> 00:21:14,831
Cut his throat.

243
00:21:14,866 --> 00:21:16,867
Wait. Wait.
Wait, wait, wait! Let's discuss this.

244
00:21:16,901 --> 00:21:19,336
And then chop off
his cock.

245
00:21:19,403 --> 00:21:20,604
We'll sell it
for a fortune.

246
00:21:20,638 --> 00:21:22,772
A dwarf's cock
has magic powers.

247
00:21:22,807 --> 00:21:25,175
Wait! Wait!

248
00:21:25,209 --> 00:21:26,576
Wait, wait, wait!

249
00:21:26,611 --> 00:21:29,212
You can't just hand
a dry cock to a merchant

250
00:21:29,247 --> 00:21:30,747
and expect him
to pay for it.

251
00:21:30,781 --> 00:21:32,782
He has to know
it came from a dwarf.

252
00:21:32,817 --> 00:21:36,119
And how could he know
unless he sees the dwarf?

253
00:21:36,153 --> 00:21:37,888
It will be
a dwarf-sized cock.

254
00:21:37,922 --> 00:21:39,923
Guess again.

255
00:21:44,795 --> 00:21:47,864
The dwarf lives
until we find a cock merchant.

256
00:21:47,899 --> 00:21:50,100
( exhales )

257
00:21:56,540 --> 00:21:59,042
Queen Daenerys
has outlawed slavery.

258
00:21:59,076 --> 00:22:02,112
We're bound for Volantis,
not Slaver's Bay.

259
00:22:02,146 --> 00:22:05,849
Besides, she reopened
the fighting pits.

260
00:22:05,883 --> 00:22:08,551
I've never heard of free men
fighting in the pits.

261
00:22:08,586 --> 00:22:10,787
Tyrion: <i>The fighting pits</i>
<i>in Meereen?</i>

262
00:22:10,821 --> 00:22:13,790
You're in luck, then.
You're about to be rich.

263
00:22:13,824 --> 00:22:17,761
You are looking at one of the
great warriors in the Seven Kingdoms.

264
00:22:17,828 --> 00:22:19,429
( laughs )

265
00:22:19,463 --> 00:22:21,064
Him.

266
00:22:21,098 --> 00:22:25,035
Him?
He's got to be 60 years old.

267
00:22:25,069 --> 00:22:27,771
Sure, he's a bit
long in the tooth,

268
00:22:27,805 --> 00:22:30,607
a bit withered,
been in the sun too long.

269
00:22:30,641 --> 00:22:34,110
We can all see that.
But he is a veteran of 100 battles.

270
00:22:34,145 --> 00:22:36,446
They wrote songs
about him.

271
00:22:42,620 --> 00:22:44,387
That true?

272
00:22:49,694 --> 00:22:52,562
He won the tournament
at Lannisport.

273
00:22:52,596 --> 00:22:55,231
Unseating Ser Jaime
Lannister himself.

274
00:22:56,467 --> 00:22:59,502
- ( laughs )
- The Kingslayer.

275
00:22:59,537 --> 00:23:02,939
Jousting.
You're talking about jousting.

276
00:23:02,974 --> 00:23:05,308
A fancy game
for fancy lads.

277
00:23:05,343 --> 00:23:08,111
The men who fight in the pits of Meereen
will swallow him whole.

278
00:23:08,145 --> 00:23:10,981
I killed a Dothraki bloodrider
in single combat.

279
00:23:21,692 --> 00:23:23,126
Liar.

280
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:25,829
It's no lie.
His name was Qotho.

281
00:23:25,863 --> 00:23:28,765
He was bloodrider
to Khal Drogo.

282
00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:32,769
Take me to Slaver's Bay,
put a sword in my hand,

283
00:23:32,803 --> 00:23:34,437
I'll prove my worth.

284
00:23:41,078 --> 00:23:43,246
( laughing )

285
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:46,116
- <i>( seagulls screeching )</i>
- <i>( bell ringing )</i>

286
00:23:46,150 --> 00:23:49,352
For my children.
Money.

287
00:23:52,990 --> 00:23:55,025
Lord Baelish.

288
00:23:55,059 --> 00:23:57,193
Yes?

289
00:23:58,529 --> 00:24:00,597
Lancel Lannister.

290
00:24:02,767 --> 00:24:04,701
Brother Lancel.

291
00:24:04,735 --> 00:24:06,336
We abandon
our family names.

292
00:24:06,370 --> 00:24:08,171
Quite a family
to abandon.

293
00:24:08,205 --> 00:24:11,374
The city has changed
since you were here last.

294
00:24:11,409 --> 00:24:13,309
We flooded the gutters
with wine,

295
00:24:13,344 --> 00:24:15,812
smashed the false idols,

296
00:24:15,846 --> 00:24:18,348
and set the godless
on the run.

297
00:24:18,382 --> 00:24:19,883
Well done.

298
00:24:25,356 --> 00:24:28,558
I'm here on urgent business
for the Queen Mother.

299
00:24:28,592 --> 00:24:31,561
Should I send word
that I'll be delayed?

300
00:24:35,332 --> 00:24:37,000
Step carefully,
Lord Baelish.

301
00:24:37,034 --> 00:24:39,469
You'll find there's little
tolerance for flesh peddlers

302
00:24:39,503 --> 00:24:41,037
in the new King's Landing.

303
00:24:41,072 --> 00:24:43,907
We both peddle fantasies,
Brother Lancel.

304
00:24:43,974 --> 00:24:46,443
Mine just happen
to be entertaining.

305
00:24:55,753 --> 00:24:59,089
Do you think it's wise,
Your Grace,

306
00:24:59,123 --> 00:25:00,924
arresting the heir
to Highgarden?

307
00:25:00,958 --> 00:25:03,793
The Faith arrested
the heir to Highgarden.

308
00:25:03,828 --> 00:25:06,930
Of course, and the Faith were
armed on your orders.

309
00:25:06,997 --> 00:25:08,765
The king's orders.

310
00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:10,900
Is the king to blame
for Ser Loras's perversion?

311
00:25:10,968 --> 00:25:12,836
House Tyrell
won't tolerate this insult.

312
00:25:12,870 --> 00:25:16,005
House Tyrell
won't tolerate it?

313
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:17,974
I'm the insulted party,
Lord Baelish.

314
00:25:18,008 --> 00:25:19,843
Ser Loras
was promised to me.

315
00:25:19,877 --> 00:25:21,878
Instead he chose
the company of boys.

316
00:25:21,912 --> 00:25:24,180
One's choice of companion
is a curious thing.

317
00:25:26,884 --> 00:25:28,451
Most curious.

318
00:25:30,654 --> 00:25:32,789
Lysa Arryn,
for instance.

319
00:25:32,823 --> 00:25:34,824
Thoroughly
repellant woman.

320
00:25:36,227 --> 00:25:38,194
Forgive me.

321
00:25:38,229 --> 00:25:40,196
I know you're still
in mourning.

322
00:25:40,231 --> 00:25:43,566
Lysa was a good woman.

323
00:25:43,601 --> 00:25:44,901
A kind woman.

324
00:25:44,935 --> 00:25:47,904
<i>She was neither</i>
<i>of those things. We both know it.</i>

325
00:25:47,938 --> 00:25:49,939
Still, I pity her son.

326
00:25:49,974 --> 00:25:52,242
How fortunate
the young Lord of the Vale

327
00:25:52,276 --> 00:25:54,577
<i>has a new father</i>
<i>to counsel him.</i>

328
00:25:54,612 --> 00:25:56,613
I know how hard
it can be

329
00:25:56,647 --> 00:25:59,449
to lose both your parents
at such a young age.

330
00:25:59,483 --> 00:26:02,523
If war comes to Westeros, will the
Knights of the Vale  fight for their king?

331
00:26:03,554 --> 00:26:05,889
Young Lord Robin
heeds my advice.

332
00:26:07,424 --> 00:26:09,826
And I have always counseled
loyalty to the throne.

333
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:11,661
Good.

334
00:26:15,966 --> 00:26:17,867
If there's
nothing else.

335
00:26:19,003 --> 00:26:20,837
There is another matter,
Your Grace.

336
00:26:20,871 --> 00:26:23,573
Something so urgent
I couldn't trust the words to a raven.

337
00:26:23,641 --> 00:26:26,509
You once charged me
with finding Arya Stark.

338
00:26:26,544 --> 00:26:29,445
To my shame,
I failed you.

339
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:31,781
But I have found
Sansa Stark.

340
00:26:33,317 --> 00:26:36,719
Alive and well
and home again

341
00:26:36,754 --> 00:26:38,221
living at Winterfell.

342
00:26:38,255 --> 00:26:40,523
That's not possible.

343
00:26:40,558 --> 00:26:42,892
My sources
are well placed.

344
00:26:44,061 --> 00:26:46,095
They tell me Roose Bolton

345
00:26:46,130 --> 00:26:48,598
plans to marry her
to his son Ramsay,

346
00:26:48,632 --> 00:26:51,301
a bastard recently
legitimized by King Tommen.

347
00:26:51,335 --> 00:26:55,305
Roose Bolton is Warden of the North
by the grace of my father.

348
00:26:55,339 --> 00:26:59,309
Indeed, his reward
for stabbing his own king in the heart.

349
00:27:00,611 --> 00:27:02,745
We were fools
to trust a turncloak.

350
00:27:02,780 --> 00:27:05,181
Marrying his son
to the last of the Starks

351
00:27:05,216 --> 00:27:07,116
gives him more legitimacy
in the North

352
00:27:07,151 --> 00:27:09,085
than an alliance with
a hated southern house.

353
00:27:09,119 --> 00:27:12,488
I will skin him
and his bastard

354
00:27:12,523 --> 00:27:14,357
like that wretch
on their bloody Sigil.

355
00:27:14,391 --> 00:27:16,192
I would counsel patience,
Your Grace.

356
00:27:16,227 --> 00:27:18,094
Patience?

357
00:27:18,128 --> 00:27:19,662
Sansa helped
murder my son.

358
00:27:19,730 --> 00:27:21,264
Roose Bolton
is a traitor.

359
00:27:21,298 --> 00:27:23,266
Stannis Baratheon
is also a traitor,

360
00:27:23,334 --> 00:27:24,901
marching with his army
on Winterfell.

361
00:27:24,935 --> 00:27:27,437
Let Stannis
and Roose battle.

362
00:27:27,471 --> 00:27:30,106
Let the enemies
of the throne slaughter each other.

363
00:27:30,140 --> 00:27:33,476
And when they're done, seize
Winterfell from whichever thief survives.

364
00:27:33,510 --> 00:27:35,979
Winterfell is 1,000 miles
away from her

365
00:27:36,013 --> 00:27:38,181
The weather has already
begun to turn.

366
00:27:38,215 --> 00:27:41,117
That is why it is critical
to strike soon

367
00:27:41,151 --> 00:27:43,586
while the victor
still licks his wounds.

368
00:27:45,356 --> 00:27:47,657
Surely your Uncle Kevan
could muster a force.

369
00:27:47,725 --> 00:27:51,027
My Uncle Kevan has all the courage
of a kitchen mouse.

370
00:27:51,061 --> 00:27:52,662
Ser Jaime, then.

371
00:27:52,696 --> 00:27:55,298
<i>Jaime's away</i>
<i>on a sensitive diplomatic mission.</i>

372
00:27:55,332 --> 00:27:58,067
I have no idea
when he'll be back.

373
00:27:58,102 --> 00:28:00,536
<i>Perhaps I can help.</i>

374
00:28:00,571 --> 00:28:03,740
The Knights of the Vale are some
of the best fighters in Westeros,

375
00:28:03,774 --> 00:28:05,975
trained to battle
in the ice and the snow.

376
00:28:06,010 --> 00:28:08,911
Forgive me,
Lord Baelish,

377
00:28:08,946 --> 00:28:11,147
you have a reputation
as a moneylender

378
00:28:11,181 --> 00:28:13,750
and a brothel keeper,
not a military man.

379
00:28:13,784 --> 00:28:15,918
You wouldn't risk
a single Lannister soldier

380
00:28:15,953 --> 00:28:19,355
or a single coin
from the royal treasury.

381
00:28:19,423 --> 00:28:21,124
What do you have to lose?

382
00:28:21,158 --> 00:28:23,026
A brothel keeper?

383
00:28:23,060 --> 00:28:24,560
And if you succeed?

384
00:28:24,595 --> 00:28:26,729
Name me
Warden of the North.

385
00:28:31,168 --> 00:28:34,637
I'll speak to the king
this evening,

386
00:28:34,672 --> 00:28:36,839
have him issue
a royal decree.

387
00:28:36,874 --> 00:28:39,709
I'll not rest until the lion flies
over Winterfell.

388
00:28:39,743 --> 00:28:42,045
And I'll know
you're a man of your word

389
00:28:42,079 --> 00:28:45,114
when I see Sansa Stark's
head on a spike.

390
00:28:45,149 --> 00:28:47,216
As I said...

391
00:28:47,251 --> 00:28:49,218
I live to serve.

392
00:28:54,692 --> 00:28:57,860
I'm going
to ask him tomorrow.

393
00:28:59,430 --> 00:29:01,164
- What if he says no?
- He won't.

394
00:29:01,231 --> 00:29:03,599
We've waited
long enough.

395
00:29:03,667 --> 00:29:05,868
I want you
to be my wife.

396
00:29:05,903 --> 00:29:07,970
Now.

397
00:29:09,239 --> 00:29:10,873
What is it?

398
00:29:10,908 --> 00:29:13,843
Do you want to marry me
because our families arranged it?

399
00:29:13,877 --> 00:29:15,745
Or do you--

400
00:29:23,187 --> 00:29:25,788
We can't.
Not yet.

401
00:29:25,823 --> 00:29:27,023
Why not?

402
00:29:27,057 --> 00:29:29,092
You know why not.
Someone will see.

403
00:29:29,126 --> 00:29:31,494
You are going
to be my wife.

404
00:29:31,528 --> 00:29:35,565
I am going to be
your husband.

405
00:29:35,599 --> 00:29:39,135
We're allowed to walk through
the gardens together.

406
00:29:39,169 --> 00:29:41,804
How many other girls have you
walked through these gardens?

407
00:29:43,774 --> 00:29:46,442
I like the way your eyes go squinty
when you're jealous.

408
00:29:46,477 --> 00:29:50,046
They do not go squinty
and you didn't answer the question.

409
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:52,515
Doran: They make
a lovely couple.

410
00:29:52,549 --> 00:29:55,718
A Lannister
and a Martell.

411
00:29:55,753 --> 00:29:59,155
<i>They have no idea</i>
<i>how dangerous that is.</i>

412
00:29:59,189 --> 00:30:01,391
We must protect them.

413
00:30:01,425 --> 00:30:03,393
Yes, my prince.

414
00:30:05,028 --> 00:30:08,131
You haven't had to use
that axe of yours in a long time.

415
00:30:09,867 --> 00:30:11,467
I hope you remember how.

416
00:30:11,502 --> 00:30:14,170
I remember how.

417
00:30:16,507 --> 00:30:20,276
Bronn: <i>? The Dornishman's wife</i>
<i>was as fair as the sun ?</i>

418
00:30:20,310 --> 00:30:25,415
? And her kisses
were warmer than spring ?

419
00:30:25,449 --> 00:30:27,383
? The Dornishman's
blade ?

420
00:30:27,418 --> 00:30:29,719
? It was made
of black steel ?

421
00:30:29,753 --> 00:30:34,223
? And its kiss
was a terrible thing ?

422
00:30:34,258 --> 00:30:38,461
? The Dornishman's wife
would sing as she bathed ?

423
00:30:38,495 --> 00:30:42,565
- ? In a voice that was sweet as a peach-- ?
- All right, that's enough.

424
00:30:42,599 --> 00:30:44,700
I'm coming
to the best part.

425
00:30:44,768 --> 00:30:46,702
We're trying
to blend in.

426
00:30:46,737 --> 00:30:48,805
Don't want everyone
in Dorne to hear your accent.

427
00:30:48,839 --> 00:30:50,640
This song really is
all about the ending.

428
00:30:50,707 --> 00:30:53,009
It can wait.
There.

429
00:30:56,413 --> 00:30:58,214
That's the Water Gardens.

430
00:30:58,248 --> 00:31:00,783
Bronn: <i>And once we've got</i>
<i>the princess, then what?</i>

431
00:31:00,818 --> 00:31:03,152
( sighs )

432
00:31:03,187 --> 00:31:05,955
I like to improvise.

433
00:31:05,989 --> 00:31:08,324
That explains
the golden hand.

434
00:31:27,811 --> 00:31:32,215
Ellaria: Unbowed. Unbent.
Unbroken.

435
00:31:33,784 --> 00:31:34,784
For Oberyn.

436
00:31:34,818 --> 00:31:36,786
All:
For Oberyn.

437
00:32:16,293 --> 00:32:18,594
Well, she's made
herself at home.

438
00:32:24,268 --> 00:32:26,536
Myrcella.

439
00:32:29,072 --> 00:32:30,940
Uncle Jaime?

440
00:32:31,008 --> 00:32:33,009
I--

441
00:32:33,043 --> 00:32:35,244
I don't understand.
What are you doing here?

442
00:32:35,279 --> 00:32:37,480
Let's speak in private.

443
00:32:37,514 --> 00:32:40,349
- I am Trystane Martell.
- Trystane is my intended.

444
00:32:40,384 --> 00:32:43,286
Excellent.
Good to meet you.

445
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:45,288
We weren't expecting you,
Lord Jaime.

446
00:32:45,322 --> 00:32:48,090
Why don't you let them
have some time alone, son?

447
00:32:52,563 --> 00:32:54,764
Let's not do
something stupid.

448
00:32:57,768 --> 00:32:59,101
( grunts )

449
00:32:59,136 --> 00:33:01,070
- ( shrieks )
- That was something stupid.

450
00:33:01,104 --> 00:33:02,638
We have to go,
Myrcella, now.

451
00:33:02,673 --> 00:33:04,774
- You hurt him!
- He'll be fine, I promise.

452
00:33:04,808 --> 00:33:06,542
But we have to--

453
00:33:06,577 --> 00:33:09,078
( grunts )

454
00:33:10,514 --> 00:33:12,415
Oh, for fuck's sake.

455
00:33:12,449 --> 00:33:14,717
( shouting )

456
00:33:14,751 --> 00:33:16,519
( whip cracks )

457
00:33:54,224 --> 00:33:55,491
Take her!

458
00:33:58,128 --> 00:33:59,862
- You're coming with me.
- I don't want to.

459
00:33:59,896 --> 00:34:01,931
I wasn't asking,
princess.

460
00:34:04,101 --> 00:34:05,201
( screams )

461
00:34:08,805 --> 00:34:11,507
- Ah!
- Drop your weapons!

462
00:34:19,683 --> 00:34:22,018
Obara:
<i>I am Obara Sand.</i>

463
00:34:22,052 --> 00:34:24,453
Daughter of Oberyn Martell.

464
00:34:24,488 --> 00:34:27,790
I fight for Dorne.
Who do you fight for?

465
00:34:27,824 --> 00:34:29,792
Drop your weapons.

466
00:34:47,177 --> 00:34:51,147
When you were whole,
it would have been a good fight.

467
00:34:54,217 --> 00:34:55,918
<i>( sword clatters )</i>

468
00:35:01,558 --> 00:35:03,626
You fight pretty good
for a little girl.

469
00:35:03,660 --> 00:35:06,328
( shouting )

470
00:35:22,813 --> 00:35:26,849
- ( horses neighing )
- <i>( seagulls screeching )</i>

471
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:32,555
Halt!

472
00:35:34,858 --> 00:35:38,761
Oh, you can smell the shit
from five miles away.

473
00:35:38,795 --> 00:35:40,963
Well, why have we stopped?
Go on.

474
00:35:40,997 --> 00:35:43,466
( horses neighing )

475
00:35:44,868 --> 00:35:47,303
Rumors and gossip,
that's all they've got.

476
00:35:47,337 --> 00:35:49,472
It's theater,
nothing more.

477
00:35:49,539 --> 00:35:52,641
If they arrested all the pillow biters
in King's Landing,

478
00:35:52,676 --> 00:35:55,711
there'd be no room left in
the dungeons for anyone else.

479
00:35:55,746 --> 00:35:57,613
Everyone knew
about him and Renly.

480
00:35:57,647 --> 00:36:01,183
Renly Baratheon shagged half
the stable boys in the Seven Kingdoms.

481
00:36:01,218 --> 00:36:03,085
Everyone knew,
no one cared.

482
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:04,687
But he was
the king's brother.

483
00:36:04,755 --> 00:36:06,522
And Loras
is the queen's brother.

484
00:36:06,556 --> 00:36:08,991
No, no, no, no.
This is unacceptable.

485
00:36:09,059 --> 00:36:11,093
- Cersei's behind it.
- Yeah, of course she is.

486
00:36:11,128 --> 00:36:13,529
She wants to drag our name
through the dirt,

487
00:36:13,597 --> 00:36:15,431
put us in our place.

488
00:36:15,465 --> 00:36:17,533
Get some rest, dear.
You look appalling.

489
00:36:17,601 --> 00:36:19,769
Let me deal
with Cersei Lannister.

490
00:36:19,803 --> 00:36:21,470
( tapping )

491
00:36:25,809 --> 00:36:29,278
Your Grace,
I have travelled a long way.

492
00:36:29,312 --> 00:36:31,781
You must be exhausted.

493
00:36:34,117 --> 00:36:36,952
Put the pen down, dear.
We both know you're not writing anything.

494
00:36:36,987 --> 00:36:40,322
Ah, yes. The famously tart-tongued
Queen of Thorns.

495
00:36:40,390 --> 00:36:43,359
And the famous tart
Queen Cersei.

496
00:36:47,097 --> 00:36:48,664
I beg your pardon?

497
00:36:48,698 --> 00:36:52,301
I know you're behind
this absurd incarceration of my grandson.

498
00:36:52,335 --> 00:36:55,171
If you apologize
for that comment, perhaps I'll--

499
00:36:55,205 --> 00:36:58,107
You'll get your apology
when I get Loras.

500
00:36:59,309 --> 00:37:01,177
I was as shocked
as anyone

501
00:37:01,211 --> 00:37:03,846
when the Faith
arrested Ser Loras.

502
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:06,482
I have no love
for these fanatics,

503
00:37:06,516 --> 00:37:09,118
but what can
a Queen Mother do?

504
00:37:10,453 --> 00:37:12,354
Has the crown
suddenly stopped needing

505
00:37:12,389 --> 00:37:15,658
the troops, gold, and wheat
my house supplies?

506
00:37:15,725 --> 00:37:17,726
I can assure you,

507
00:37:17,761 --> 00:37:19,795
our alliance with
House Tyrell remains--

508
00:37:19,830 --> 00:37:21,463
Do you expect
the alliance to continue

509
00:37:21,498 --> 00:37:24,200
after you've thrown
our future into prison?

510
00:37:24,267 --> 00:37:26,569
As I said,

511
00:37:26,603 --> 00:37:29,071
I didn't imprison anyone.

512
00:37:29,105 --> 00:37:30,506
As for your
veiled threats--

513
00:37:30,540 --> 00:37:31,974
What veil?

514
00:37:32,008 --> 00:37:34,310
( sighs )

515
00:37:34,344 --> 00:37:38,848
The Lannister-Tyrell alliance
brought peace to a war-torn country.

516
00:37:38,915 --> 00:37:42,117
Do you really want to see the
Seven Kingdoms slide back into warfare?

517
00:37:45,255 --> 00:37:46,789
I didn't trust
your father.

518
00:37:46,857 --> 00:37:49,458
<i>I didn't</i>
<i>particularly like him.</i>

519
00:37:49,492 --> 00:37:53,028
<i>But I respected him.</i>
<i>He was no fool.</i>

520
00:37:53,063 --> 00:37:56,765
He understood that sometimes
we must work with our rivals

521
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:58,367
rather than destroy them.

522
00:37:58,401 --> 00:38:00,603
House Lannister
has no rival.

523
00:38:03,039 --> 00:38:06,508
The High Septon has called
for an inquest, not a trial.

524
00:38:06,543 --> 00:38:08,244
Just a small hearing
to determine

525
00:38:08,278 --> 00:38:11,113
whether the charges
against Loras have merit,

526
00:38:11,147 --> 00:38:13,182
which I'm sure they don't.

527
00:38:13,216 --> 00:38:16,685
Loras will be freed,
our happy alliance will continue...

528
00:38:18,421 --> 00:38:21,357
and we'll forget this unfortunate
conversation ever happened.

529
00:38:23,126 --> 00:38:24,693
Good day, Lady Olenna.

530
00:38:40,443 --> 00:38:42,778
<i>( door opens, closes )</i>

531
00:38:44,314 --> 00:38:47,082
You are aware of the rumors
concerning you and Renly?

532
00:38:48,218 --> 00:38:50,786
I don't pay attention
to rumors.

533
00:38:50,820 --> 00:38:54,156
<i>You were said</i>
<i>to be despondent when he died.</i>

534
00:38:54,190 --> 00:38:57,726
Witnesses state that you refused
to leave his bedside

535
00:38:57,761 --> 00:39:00,296
even as Stannis's army
closed in.

536
00:39:00,330 --> 00:39:04,166
He was my friend.
He was my king.

537
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:06,635
Wasn't Joffrey your king?

538
00:39:06,670 --> 00:39:09,672
<i>He was anointed</i>
<i>by the Seven, not Renly.</i>

539
00:39:09,706 --> 00:39:14,276
I was wrong to support
Renly's claim, I know that.

540
00:39:15,445 --> 00:39:17,846
But I was forgiven
by Joffrey.

541
00:39:17,881 --> 00:39:20,349
I fought for him
at the Battle of Blackwater.

542
00:39:20,383 --> 00:39:24,053
Yes, wearing
Renly's armor.

543
00:39:24,087 --> 00:39:26,455
Why does it matter
what I wore?

544
00:39:26,489 --> 00:39:29,124
Do you deny all
the charges against you?

545
00:39:29,159 --> 00:39:31,193
Fornication.

546
00:39:31,227 --> 00:39:33,395
<i>Buggery.</i>
<i>Blasphemy.</i>

547
00:39:33,430 --> 00:39:35,030
Of course I deny them.

548
00:39:35,065 --> 00:39:37,132
You never lay
with Renly Baratheon?

549
00:39:37,167 --> 00:39:39,101
Never.

550
00:39:39,135 --> 00:39:41,303
<i>Nor any other man?</i>

551
00:39:41,338 --> 00:39:42,938
Never.

552
00:39:45,308 --> 00:39:47,943
That will be all,
Ser Loras.

553
00:39:55,085 --> 00:39:57,820
Well, I think that's
quite enough of that.

554
00:39:57,854 --> 00:40:00,422
The Faith calls
Queen Margaery forward.

555
00:40:00,457 --> 00:40:02,424
You call me forward?

556
00:40:02,492 --> 00:40:04,793
Yes, we have some
questions for you.

557
00:40:04,828 --> 00:40:08,931
- I am the queen.
- You are.

558
00:40:08,965 --> 00:40:11,400
And according
to the law of the Seven,

559
00:40:11,434 --> 00:40:13,836
neither kings
nor queens are exempt

560
00:40:13,870 --> 00:40:16,772
from testimony
at a holy inquest.

561
00:40:34,758 --> 00:40:38,427
How do you respond to these charges
against your brother?

562
00:40:38,461 --> 00:40:40,195
They are lies.

563
00:40:40,230 --> 00:40:41,897
- All of them?
- All of them.

564
00:40:41,931 --> 00:40:44,900
High Sparrow:
<i>Queen Margaery,</i>

565
00:40:44,934 --> 00:40:46,435
<i>in the presence</i>
<i>of the gods,</i>

566
00:40:46,469 --> 00:40:48,704
do you swear
that your brother is innocent

567
00:40:48,738 --> 00:40:50,639
of these charges
against him

568
00:40:50,673 --> 00:40:52,274
to the best
of your knowledge?

569
00:40:52,308 --> 00:40:54,376
Yes, I swear it.

570
00:40:55,645 --> 00:40:57,880
Thank you,
Your Grace.

571
00:41:23,406 --> 00:41:25,174
Do you know this man?

572
00:41:25,208 --> 00:41:28,710
Yes, very well.

573
00:41:28,745 --> 00:41:31,480
<i>He is Ser Loras Tyrell,</i>
<i>heir to Highgarden.</i>

574
00:41:31,514 --> 00:41:34,183
How did you
come to meet?

575
00:41:34,217 --> 00:41:36,819
Olyvar:
<i>I squired for him.</i>

576
00:41:36,853 --> 00:41:38,687
He took a liking to me.

577
00:41:38,721 --> 00:41:41,256
He summoned me to his chamber
the first day we met.

578
00:41:42,926 --> 00:41:46,662
And what occurred
in his chamber?

579
00:41:46,696 --> 00:41:51,166
We engaged
in intimate relations.

580
00:41:51,201 --> 00:41:53,035
You lay with him?

581
00:41:53,069 --> 00:41:54,603
That night
and many others.

582
00:41:54,637 --> 00:41:57,106
Liar.
He's a liar.

583
00:41:58,641 --> 00:42:00,521
Is there anyone else
who can support your claim?

584
00:42:00,543 --> 00:42:02,811
Yes.

585
00:42:02,846 --> 00:42:05,747
Yes, Queen Margaery.

586
00:42:05,815 --> 00:42:09,151
<i>She walked in on us once</i>
<i>not long ago.</i>

587
00:42:09,185 --> 00:42:11,887
She didn't seem
surprised.

588
00:42:11,921 --> 00:42:15,824
This testimony is an insult
to a great house.

589
00:42:15,859 --> 00:42:19,027
Why should the Faith or anyone
else take the word of a squire

590
00:42:19,062 --> 00:42:20,729
over the heir
to Highgarden?

591
00:42:20,763 --> 00:42:22,764
Olyvar: <i>He has a birthmark,</i>
<i>Your Grace.</i>

592
00:42:22,832 --> 00:42:25,734
<i>Quite high on his thigh.</i>

593
00:42:25,768 --> 00:42:28,770
Wine-colored and roughly
the shape of Dorne.

594
00:42:28,838 --> 00:42:31,340
No! Liar!

595
00:42:31,374 --> 00:42:33,108
( grunting )

596
00:42:33,143 --> 00:42:37,045
What are you doing?
Let us pass.

597
00:42:37,080 --> 00:42:39,581
The Faith is satisfied
there is enough evidence

598
00:42:39,616 --> 00:42:41,517
to bring a formal trial

599
00:42:41,584 --> 00:42:43,819
<i>for Ser Loras</i>

600
00:42:43,853 --> 00:42:45,654
and Queen Margaery.

601
00:42:45,688 --> 00:42:46,955
What?

602
00:42:46,990 --> 00:42:49,024
Bearing false witness
before the gods

603
00:42:49,058 --> 00:42:51,693
<i>is as grave a sin</i>
<i>as any, my lady.</i>

604
00:42:51,728 --> 00:42:53,462
Take her.

605
00:42:53,530 --> 00:42:56,198
Margaery:
<i>No. Tommen.</i>

606
00:42:56,266 --> 00:42:58,000
Tommen!

607
00:42:59,235 --> 00:43:01,336
You can't do this.
I am the queen.

608
00:43:01,371 --> 00:43:04,039
Tommen!
Tommen!

609
00:43:04,073 --> 00:43:06,575
<i>I am your queen.</i>
<i>How dare you?</i>

610
00:43:06,609 --> 00:43:08,110
<i>Take your hands off me!</i>

611
00:43:08,178 --> 00:43:10,812
<i>( shouting )</i>
<i>Tommen!</i>

612
00:43:24,127 --> 00:43:26,461
<i>( knocks on door )</i>

613
00:43:26,496 --> 00:43:29,097
<i>( wind whistling )</i>

614
00:43:34,037 --> 00:43:36,205
What do you want?

615
00:43:36,239 --> 00:43:39,074
Lord Ramsay sent me to draw you
a bath, my lady.

616
00:43:39,108 --> 00:43:41,843
You want to be
clean and fresh

617
00:43:41,878 --> 00:43:43,745
for your new husband,
don't you?

618
00:44:00,530 --> 00:44:03,131
You're so beautiful,

619
00:44:03,166 --> 00:44:06,201
but you need
to keep him happy.

620
00:44:06,236 --> 00:44:10,505
Ramsay gets
bored easily.

621
00:44:10,540 --> 00:44:12,641
You don't want
to end up like--

622
00:44:14,611 --> 00:44:17,246
well, like the others.

623
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:19,615
What others?

624
00:44:19,649 --> 00:44:21,917
Myranda:
I shouldn't gossip.

625
00:44:21,951 --> 00:44:24,553
Oh, it's good to see
the red again.

626
00:44:24,587 --> 00:44:26,588
No point hiding anymore.

627
00:44:26,623 --> 00:44:28,090
What others?

628
00:44:28,124 --> 00:44:30,726
Let's see,
there was Kyra

629
00:44:30,760 --> 00:44:32,728
the blacksmith's
daughter.

630
00:44:32,795 --> 00:44:35,364
She was tall like you,
lovely figure.

631
00:44:35,398 --> 00:44:39,868
But she talked
and talked and talked

632
00:44:39,902 --> 00:44:43,272
and Ramsay grew
tired of that.

633
00:44:43,306 --> 00:44:45,807
Then there was Violet.

634
00:44:45,842 --> 00:44:48,377
She had gorgeous
blonde hair.

635
00:44:48,411 --> 00:44:51,346
But she got pregnant.

636
00:44:51,381 --> 00:44:54,283
And, well,
that was boring.

637
00:44:54,317 --> 00:44:57,986
Then Tansy.

638
00:44:58,021 --> 00:44:59,655
Such a sweet girl.

639
00:44:59,689 --> 00:45:04,893
Of course, sweet girls
get a bit dull

640
00:45:04,927 --> 00:45:06,995
after a while,
don't they?

641
00:45:07,030 --> 00:45:09,331
Ramsay let me come
with him on that hunt.

642
00:45:09,365 --> 00:45:10,499
Hunt?

643
00:45:10,566 --> 00:45:12,367
Mmm.

644
00:45:14,437 --> 00:45:18,707
Have you ever seen
a body after the dogs have been at it?

645
00:45:18,775 --> 00:45:20,642
Not so pretty.

646
00:45:22,612 --> 00:45:25,781
But, well, it's your
wedding day.

647
00:45:25,815 --> 00:45:28,283
Why am I talking
about such things?

648
00:45:30,620 --> 00:45:32,421
What was your name again?

649
00:45:32,455 --> 00:45:34,056
Myranda.

650
00:45:36,292 --> 00:45:38,894
And how long have you
loved him, Myranda?

651
00:45:42,298 --> 00:45:45,434
Did you imagine that he would be
with you forever, is that it?

652
00:45:45,468 --> 00:45:47,636
And I came along
and ruined it.

653
00:45:50,840 --> 00:45:54,276
I'm Sansa Stark
of Winterfell.

654
00:45:54,310 --> 00:45:58,714
This is my home
and you can't frighten me.

655
00:46:04,520 --> 00:46:07,322
Are you done with
your bath, my lady?

656
00:46:08,324 --> 00:46:10,258
Go. I can finish
on my own.

657
00:46:34,751 --> 00:46:37,285
- <i>( knocks on door )</i>
- Yes?

658
00:46:44,761 --> 00:46:49,331
I've come to escort you
to the godswood, my lady.

659
00:46:53,903 --> 00:46:57,205
If you please, my lady,
will you take my arm?

660
00:46:57,273 --> 00:46:59,741
No.

661
00:46:59,776 --> 00:47:03,078
Lord Ramsay, he said
I'm to take your arm.

662
00:47:03,112 --> 00:47:04,613
I'm not touching you.

663
00:47:06,549 --> 00:47:08,450
Please.

664
00:47:08,518 --> 00:47:10,452
He'll punish me.

665
00:47:12,321 --> 00:47:14,990
You think I care
what he does to you?

666
00:48:32,034 --> 00:48:35,003
Who comes before
the old gods this night?

667
00:48:36,205 --> 00:48:39,641
Theon:
Sansa of the House Stark

668
00:48:39,675 --> 00:48:42,410
comes here
to be wed.

669
00:48:44,547 --> 00:48:48,316
A woman grown,
trueborn and noble.

670
00:48:48,351 --> 00:48:52,787
She comes to beg
the blessings of the gods.

671
00:48:54,624 --> 00:48:56,725
Who comes to claim her?

672
00:49:05,668 --> 00:49:07,636
Ramsay of House Bolton.

673
00:49:08,971 --> 00:49:11,273
<i>Heir to the Dreadfort</i>
<i>and Winterfell.</i>

674
00:49:13,776 --> 00:49:16,211
Who gives her?

675
00:49:18,481 --> 00:49:23,685
Theon of House Greyjoy,
who was--

676
00:49:28,090 --> 00:49:29,658
who was her father's ward.

677
00:49:31,961 --> 00:49:35,497
Lady Sansa,
will you take this man?

678
00:50:05,261 --> 00:50:07,095
I take this man.

679
00:50:38,594 --> 00:50:40,762
Are you pleased,
my lady?

680
00:50:43,532 --> 00:50:46,534
Good. I want you
to be happy.

681
00:50:52,174 --> 00:50:53,975
( sighs )

682
00:50:56,746 --> 00:50:59,414
My father said
you're still a virgin.

683
00:51:05,021 --> 00:51:07,689
- Uh, yes.
- Why?

684
00:51:11,394 --> 00:51:14,629
Why are you
still a virgin?

685
00:51:14,697 --> 00:51:16,931
Afraid of dwarves?
( chuckles )

686
00:51:18,467 --> 00:51:20,568
Lord-- Lord Tyrion
was kind.

687
00:51:20,603 --> 00:51:24,139
He was gentle.
He never touched me.

688
00:51:25,775 --> 00:51:27,142
You're not lying to me?

689
00:51:27,209 --> 00:51:28,977
No, my lord.

690
00:51:29,011 --> 00:51:31,746
Lying to your husband
on his wedding night,

691
00:51:31,781 --> 00:51:35,283
that would be a bad way
to start a marriage.

692
00:51:40,189 --> 00:51:43,324
We're man and wife now.

693
00:51:43,359 --> 00:51:45,427
We should be honest
with each other.

694
00:51:45,528 --> 00:51:47,262
Don't you think?

695
00:51:48,230 --> 00:51:50,131
Yes.

696
00:52:00,142 --> 00:52:01,976
Good.

697
00:52:04,213 --> 00:52:06,081
Take off your clothes.

698
00:52:10,019 --> 00:52:12,087
Oh, no, no, no.

699
00:52:12,154 --> 00:52:15,123
You stay here, Reek.

700
00:52:15,157 --> 00:52:17,425
You watch.

701
00:52:29,472 --> 00:52:32,474
Do I need to ask
a second time?

702
00:52:32,541 --> 00:52:34,743
I hate asking
a second time.

703
00:53:02,705 --> 00:53:03,905
Reek...

704
00:53:03,939 --> 00:53:07,142
I told you to watch.

705
00:53:12,882 --> 00:53:15,984
You've known Sansa
since she was a girl.

706
00:53:17,253 --> 00:53:19,087
Now watch her
become a woman.

707
00:53:26,028 --> 00:53:28,363

00:53:33,035 --> 00:53:35,403

709
00:53:35,437 --> 00:53:37,639
