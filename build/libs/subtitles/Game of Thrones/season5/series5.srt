1
00:00:00,758 --> 00:00:03,274
When I had refused
the Throne.

2
00:00:03,298 --> 00:00:07,188
Aerys reigned, whom they called
the Mad King.

3
00:00:07,212 --> 00:00:08,951
You're Aemon Targaryen.

4
00:00:09,741 --> 00:00:10,975
What happened to your face?

5
00:00:11,435 --> 00:00:12,525
Greyscale.

6
00:00:12,526 --> 00:00:15,023
Everyone advised me to send
you to the ruins of Valyria

7
00:00:15,047 --> 00:00:17,265
to live out your short life
with the Stone Men.

8
00:00:17,289 --> 00:00:18,717
Two of my sisters had it.

9
00:00:18,741 --> 00:00:19,782
They were covered with it.

10
00:00:19,803 --> 00:00:21,171
They acted like animals.

11
00:00:23,576 --> 00:00:24,576
Hide.

12
00:00:24,603 --> 00:00:25,851
Hide!

13
00:00:29,936 --> 00:00:31,029
Put him in chains.

14
00:00:31,448 --> 00:00:33,814
You want me alive
so you can torture me?

15
00:00:35,608 --> 00:00:36,669
Sansa Stark?

16
00:00:36,693 --> 00:00:38,898
I saw her riding on the East
Road with Littlefinger.

17
00:00:40,425 --> 00:00:41,425
We'll follow them.

18
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:44,387
May I introduce my son
Ramsay Bolton?

19
00:00:44,411 --> 00:00:45,739
My lady.

20
00:00:46,967 --> 00:00:48,819
Welcome home,
Lady Stark.

21
00:00:49,207 --> 00:00:50,777
The North remembers.

22
00:00:52,949 --> 00:00:54,990
You let a halfwit
escape with a cripple.

23
00:00:55,537 --> 00:00:57,057
And Rickon, too?
The little one?

24
00:00:57,081 --> 00:01:00,147
I told you what would happen
if you served me loyally...

25
00:01:00,493 --> 00:01:02,442
<i>and what would happen</i>
<i>if you did not.</i>

26
00:01:09,704 --> 00:01:10,817
Who are you?

27
00:01:10,841 --> 00:01:11,989
Your captor.

28
00:01:12,013 --> 00:01:14,165
You said you were
taking me to the queen.

29
00:01:14,189 --> 00:01:16,206
Queen Daenerys Targaryen.

30
00:01:16,393 --> 00:01:18,123
You're the Mother
of Dragons.

31
00:01:18,305 --> 00:01:19,910
Show your strength.

32
00:01:19,934 --> 00:01:21,906
No one's seen
Drogon in weeks.

33
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:24,066
For all I know, he's flown halfway
across the world.

34
00:01:24,527 --> 00:01:27,464
The wise masters ask for the
reopening of the fighting pit.

35
00:01:27,488 --> 00:01:29,537
Where slaves fought
slaves to the death?

36
00:01:29,561 --> 00:01:31,638
Opening them would show
the people of Meereen

37
00:01:31,662 --> 00:01:33,363
that you respect their traditions.

38
00:01:33,387 --> 00:01:37,454
Traditions are the only thing
that will hold this city, together.

39
00:01:49,203 --> 00:01:53,203

44
00:04:20,988 --> 00:04:23,390
I'm so sorry, my queen.

45
00:04:23,582 --> 00:04:25,416
He was a good man.

46
00:04:25,451 --> 00:04:28,820
"Barristan the Bold"
they called him.

47
00:04:28,854 --> 00:04:31,823
He crossed a continent
to serve me.

48
00:04:31,857 --> 00:04:34,359
He was a loyal friend.

49
00:04:36,128 --> 00:04:38,563
And he died in an alley,

50
00:04:38,597 --> 00:04:41,632
butchered by cowards
who hide behind masks.

51
00:04:44,269 --> 00:04:46,871
We could pull back
to the pyramid district,

52
00:04:46,905 --> 00:04:50,208
<i>secure it, and use it as a base</i>
<i>from which to operate.</i>

53
00:04:50,242 --> 00:04:53,378
Then we clean the city out,

54
00:04:53,412 --> 00:04:57,248
<i>neighborhood by neighborhood,</i>
<i>street by street,</i>

55
00:04:57,282 --> 00:04:59,550
until the rats
have nowhere left to hide.

56
00:05:03,422 --> 00:05:06,024
I prefer
your earlier suggestion.

57
00:05:06,058 --> 00:05:09,861
Round up the leaders of each of Meereen's
great families and bring them to me.

58
00:05:11,363 --> 00:05:15,133
But I'm the leader
of my family.

59
00:05:17,703 --> 00:05:19,103
No, Your Grace.

60
00:05:19,138 --> 00:05:21,773
I had nothing
to do with this.

61
00:05:21,807 --> 00:05:23,741
Your Grace!

62
00:07:54,626 --> 00:07:56,394
Don't want
to overfeed them.

63
00:08:00,132 --> 00:08:02,033
Tomorrow perhaps.

64
00:08:38,203 --> 00:08:41,505
"And though Daenerys
maintains her grip on Slaver's Bay,

65
00:08:41,540 --> 00:08:44,976
forces rise against her
from within and without.

66
00:08:45,010 --> 00:08:47,111
She refuses to leave
until the freedom

67
00:08:47,145 --> 00:08:49,914
of the former slaves
is secure."

68
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:53,017
She sounds like
quite a woman.

69
00:08:53,051 --> 00:08:54,952
And she's alone,

70
00:08:54,987 --> 00:08:56,554
under siege,

71
00:08:56,588 --> 00:08:59,991
no family to guide her
or protect her.

72
00:09:00,025 --> 00:09:04,095
Her last relation
thousands of miles away,

73
00:09:04,129 --> 00:09:07,698
useless, dying.

74
00:09:09,234 --> 00:09:11,969
Don't say that,
Maester Aemon.

75
00:09:12,037 --> 00:09:17,041
A Targaryen
alone in the world

76
00:09:17,075 --> 00:09:19,644
is a terrible thing.

77
00:09:22,514 --> 00:09:24,348
Maester Aemon.

78
00:09:24,383 --> 00:09:26,651
Lord Commander.

79
00:09:26,685 --> 00:09:29,620
Sam, I'd like to speak
to the maester alone.

80
00:09:44,936 --> 00:09:46,637
How are you feeling?

81
00:09:46,672 --> 00:09:49,307
Oh, like
a hundred-year-old man

82
00:09:49,341 --> 00:09:51,742
slowly freezing to death.

83
00:09:56,014 --> 00:09:58,916
I need your advice.

84
00:09:58,950 --> 00:10:01,519
There's something I want
to do, something I...

85
00:10:01,553 --> 00:10:02,987
have to do.

86
00:10:03,021 --> 00:10:05,423
But it'll divide
the Night's Watch.

87
00:10:05,457 --> 00:10:06,924
Bitterly.

88
00:10:06,958 --> 00:10:10,461
Half the men will hate me the moment
I give the order.

89
00:10:10,495 --> 00:10:14,098
Half the men hate you
already, Lord Commander.

90
00:10:14,132 --> 00:10:16,200
Do it.

91
00:10:16,234 --> 00:10:17,702
But you don't know
what it is.

92
00:10:17,736 --> 00:10:19,870
That doesn't matter.

93
00:10:19,905 --> 00:10:22,340
You do.

94
00:10:24,076 --> 00:10:28,112
You will find little joy
in your command.

95
00:10:28,146 --> 00:10:30,715
But with luck,

96
00:10:30,749 --> 00:10:35,419
you will find the strength to do
what needs to be done.

97
00:10:36,521 --> 00:10:39,924
Kill the boy, Jon Snow.

98
00:10:39,958 --> 00:10:43,461
Winter is almost
upon us.

99
00:10:43,495 --> 00:10:46,263
Kill the boy

100
00:10:46,298 --> 00:10:49,367
and let the man be born.

101
00:10:58,310 --> 00:11:00,811
Where are the rest
of the free folk now?

102
00:11:00,846 --> 00:11:02,646
Where have they gone?

103
00:11:07,052 --> 00:11:09,120
Who leads them?

104
00:11:09,154 --> 00:11:11,622
They followed Mance.

105
00:11:11,656 --> 00:11:14,225
They won't follow
anyone else.

106
00:11:16,828 --> 00:11:18,896
What about you?

107
00:11:20,298 --> 00:11:22,833
Hard to lead
when you're in chains.

108
00:11:26,438 --> 00:11:28,139
What if I unchained you?

109
00:11:28,173 --> 00:11:31,208
Why would you do that?

110
00:11:31,243 --> 00:11:34,145
Because you
are not my enemy.

111
00:11:34,179 --> 00:11:35,846
And I'm not yours.

112
00:11:35,881 --> 00:11:38,783
You sure seemed like my enemy
when you were killing my friends.

113
00:11:38,817 --> 00:11:41,585
For 8,000 years the Night's Watch
have sworn an oath

114
00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:43,988
to be the shield
that guards the realms of men.

115
00:11:45,590 --> 00:11:48,793
And for 8,000 years
we've fallen short of that oath.

116
00:11:48,827 --> 00:11:51,896
You belong
to the realms of men.

117
00:11:51,930 --> 00:11:53,898
All of you.

118
00:11:53,932 --> 00:11:56,734
And now everything
is going to change?

119
00:11:56,768 --> 00:11:58,769
- It is.
- Why now?

120
00:11:58,804 --> 00:12:02,807
Because now I am Lord Commander
of the Night's Watch.

121
00:12:02,841 --> 00:12:05,976
What would you
have me do,

122
00:12:06,011 --> 00:12:08,412
Lord Commander?

123
00:12:10,115 --> 00:12:12,183
I'd have you go
north of the Wall.

124
00:12:12,217 --> 00:12:16,020
Gather the remaining free folk wherever
they are and bring them back here.

125
00:12:16,054 --> 00:12:19,623
I'll open the gates
for them and let them through.

126
00:12:19,658 --> 00:12:22,726
I'll find them lands to settle
south of the Wall.

127
00:12:22,761 --> 00:12:26,363
They won't kneel for you
and neither will I.

128
00:12:26,398 --> 00:12:29,266
I don't want them
to kneel for me.

129
00:12:29,301 --> 00:12:31,769
I want them to fight with me
when the time comes.

130
00:12:31,803 --> 00:12:34,572
The day I ask my people
to fight with the crows

131
00:12:34,606 --> 00:12:37,541
is the day my people
cut my guts from my belly

132
00:12:37,576 --> 00:12:38,642
and make me eat them.

133
00:12:38,677 --> 00:12:41,579
And how many
of your people can't fight?

134
00:12:41,613 --> 00:12:44,715
The women, the children,
the old, the sick--

135
00:12:44,749 --> 00:12:46,584
what happens to them?

136
00:12:46,618 --> 00:12:48,686
You're condemning
them to death.

137
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:52,490
Worse than death because
you're too proud to make peace.

138
00:12:55,927 --> 00:12:58,028
Or maybe
you're not proud.

139
00:12:59,965 --> 00:13:01,565
Maybe you're
just a coward.

140
00:13:08,473 --> 00:13:11,575
Easy thing to say
to a man in chains.

141
00:13:36,067 --> 00:13:37,701
Your people
need a leader.

142
00:13:37,736 --> 00:13:40,971
And they Nd to get south of the Wall
before it's too late.

143
00:13:41,006 --> 00:13:43,107
We don't have much time
and they have less.

144
00:13:43,141 --> 00:13:46,076
The walkers are coming
and they'll hit your people first.

145
00:13:47,812 --> 00:13:50,681
I'm not asking you to make peace
to save your skin.

146
00:13:50,715 --> 00:13:54,485
Make peace to save
your people.

147
00:14:02,928 --> 00:14:05,162
Most of them
are at Hardhome.

148
00:14:05,196 --> 00:14:06,497
You know where that is?

149
00:14:06,531 --> 00:14:08,399
Up on Storrold's Point.

150
00:14:08,433 --> 00:14:10,601
I can give you 10 horses
and nine other men.

151
00:14:10,635 --> 00:14:12,536
You can get there
in a week.

152
00:14:12,571 --> 00:14:14,171
We'll need ships.

153
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:18,208
I'll talk to King Stannis
about lending you his fleet.

154
00:14:21,580 --> 00:14:23,147
All right, then.

155
00:14:24,950 --> 00:14:27,184
You're coming with me.

156
00:14:28,587 --> 00:14:30,888
<i>You're the Lord Commander</i>
<i>of the Night's Watch.</i>

157
00:14:30,922 --> 00:14:33,190
They need
to hear it from you.

158
00:14:33,224 --> 00:14:35,492
They need to know
the ships they are boarding

159
00:14:35,527 --> 00:14:37,761
won't be torched
in the middle of the sea.

160
00:14:37,796 --> 00:14:42,967
You come with me
or I don't go.

161
00:14:50,909 --> 00:14:53,677
You'd bring wildlings here
through our gates?

162
00:14:53,712 --> 00:14:57,247
Men, women, and children
will die by the thousands if we do nothing.

163
00:14:57,282 --> 00:15:00,484
Let them die.
We got our own to worry about.

164
00:15:00,518 --> 00:15:03,487
Less enemies for us.

165
00:15:03,521 --> 00:15:05,255
Fewer.

166
00:15:05,290 --> 00:15:07,992
- What?
- Nothing.

167
00:15:08,026 --> 00:15:11,862
Look, well, there is
good farmland in the Gift.

168
00:15:11,896 --> 00:15:14,231
Land that no one uses now.

169
00:15:14,265 --> 00:15:16,300
A dozen
abandoned villages.

170
00:15:16,334 --> 00:15:18,469
And why do you think
the farmers abandoned those villages?

171
00:15:18,503 --> 00:15:21,972
<i>Because the wildlings</i>
<i>raided them for years.</i>

172
00:15:22,007 --> 00:15:25,676
Cut them down just like
they did this boy's people.

173
00:15:25,710 --> 00:15:28,012
Aye!

174
00:15:28,046 --> 00:15:31,682
<i>We've been fighting them</i>
<i>for thousands of years.</i>

175
00:15:31,716 --> 00:15:33,751
They've slaughtered
villages.

176
00:15:33,785 --> 00:15:36,320
<i>They've slaughtered</i>
<i>our brothers.</i>

177
00:15:36,354 --> 00:15:38,055
And we've slaughtered theirs.

178
00:15:39,624 --> 00:15:44,061
I will follow you anywhere,
you know that.

179
00:15:45,296 --> 00:15:47,464
- But they killed Grenn.
- Yes.

180
00:15:47,499 --> 00:15:50,000
- And they killed Pyp.
- Aye.

181
00:15:50,035 --> 00:15:52,803
<i>They killed 50</i>
<i>of our brothers.</i>

182
00:15:52,837 --> 00:15:54,705
<i>I can't forget that.</i>

183
00:15:54,739 --> 00:15:56,507
I can't forgive it.

184
00:15:56,541 --> 00:15:59,076
You were at the Fist
of the First Men.

185
00:15:59,110 --> 00:16:01,745
If we abandon them,
you know what they become.

186
00:16:01,780 --> 00:16:04,048
<i>We can learn to live</i>
<i>with the wildlings</i>

187
00:16:04,082 --> 00:16:06,517
<i>or we can add them</i>
<i>to the army of the dead.</i>

188
00:16:06,551 --> 00:16:10,921
Whatever they are now,
they're better than that.

189
00:16:39,284 --> 00:16:41,185
Thank you.

190
00:16:41,219 --> 00:16:42,853
<i>Olly.</i>

191
00:16:44,589 --> 00:16:47,491
<i>If you have something</i>
<i>you want to say to me,</i>

192
00:16:47,525 --> 00:16:49,226
<i>say it.</i>

193
00:16:55,967 --> 00:16:58,035
It's all right.

194
00:16:59,437 --> 00:17:01,505
You don't mean it,
do you?

195
00:17:03,141 --> 00:17:05,776
Telling the wildlings
you want to make peace.

196
00:17:05,810 --> 00:17:07,811
You're just doing it
to trick them.

197
00:17:07,846 --> 00:17:09,379
It's not a trick.

198
00:17:09,414 --> 00:17:10,948
They burned my village.

199
00:17:10,982 --> 00:17:13,016
They put an arrow
through my father's head

200
00:17:13,051 --> 00:17:14,585
right in front of me.

201
00:17:14,619 --> 00:17:17,888
They butchered my mother,
everyone I ever knew.

202
00:17:25,663 --> 00:17:28,599
I know what it's like
to lose the people you love.

203
00:17:30,702 --> 00:17:33,003
I know this is hard
for you.

204
00:17:34,539 --> 00:17:37,374
But winter is coming.

205
00:17:37,408 --> 00:17:40,911
We know what's
coming with it.

206
00:17:40,945 --> 00:17:42,846
We can't face it alone.

207
00:17:48,286 --> 00:17:51,288
Will there be anything else
you need, Lord Commander?

208
00:17:54,526 --> 00:17:56,126
No.

209
00:18:29,627 --> 00:18:31,962
She's far away
from the Lannisters.

210
00:18:32,831 --> 00:18:34,464
<i>This is her home.</i>

211
00:18:37,335 --> 00:18:39,436
Maybe Lady Sansa's
better off here.

212
00:18:40,705 --> 00:18:43,073
Better off
with the Boltons

213
00:18:43,107 --> 00:18:45,809
who murdered
her mother and brother?

214
00:18:54,385 --> 00:18:57,187
Sansa's in danger even
if she doesn't realize it.

215
00:19:11,269 --> 00:19:13,036
Thank you.

216
00:19:14,939 --> 00:19:16,573
You've lived here
a long time?

217
00:19:18,509 --> 00:19:20,210
Aye.

218
00:19:20,245 --> 00:19:22,946
Did you know Lord Eddard?

219
00:19:24,916 --> 00:19:27,150
I knew him

220
00:19:27,185 --> 00:19:29,720
and his father
before him.

221
00:19:31,456 --> 00:19:33,824
The Starks are gone now.

222
00:19:33,858 --> 00:19:35,692
Not all of them.

223
00:19:35,727 --> 00:19:38,528
<i>I know who's inside</i>
<i>that castle.</i>

224
00:19:38,563 --> 00:19:40,430
Everyone knows.

225
00:19:40,465 --> 00:19:41,899
The Boltons.

226
00:19:41,933 --> 00:19:44,268
I'm not talking
about the Boltons.

227
00:19:45,670 --> 00:19:47,938
I need to get
a message to her.

228
00:19:47,972 --> 00:19:49,806
To Sansa Stark.

229
00:19:51,876 --> 00:19:53,677
Who are you?

230
00:19:53,711 --> 00:19:56,346
Someone who swore
to keep her safe.

231
00:19:56,381 --> 00:19:58,148
Swore to who?

232
00:19:58,182 --> 00:20:00,350
Her mother.

233
00:20:00,385 --> 00:20:02,286
Her mother's dead.

234
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:05,088
That doesn't release me
from an oath.

235
00:20:08,192 --> 00:20:10,694
I served Lady Catelyn.

236
00:20:10,728 --> 00:20:13,330
I serve her still.

237
00:20:14,832 --> 00:20:16,800
Who do you serve?

238
00:20:23,174 --> 00:20:25,309
<i>Come back here.</i>

239
00:20:29,013 --> 00:20:30,147
Myranda.

240
00:20:30,181 --> 00:20:32,249
I saw you
staring at her.

241
00:20:32,283 --> 00:20:33,984
I'm going to marry her.

242
00:20:34,018 --> 00:20:37,120
That will involve looking
at her from time to time.

243
00:20:40,692 --> 00:20:42,459
You said you'd marry me.

244
00:20:43,661 --> 00:20:45,362
And I meant it.

245
00:20:45,396 --> 00:20:47,497
When I was a bastard
named Snow.

246
00:20:47,532 --> 00:20:49,800
<i>But I'm a Bolton now.</i>

247
00:20:49,834 --> 00:20:53,971
What I want is no longer
the primary consideration.

248
00:20:54,005 --> 00:20:56,406
I'm furthering a dynasty.

249
00:20:59,410 --> 00:21:00,744
Do you think
she's pretty?

250
00:21:00,778 --> 00:21:03,447
Of course I do.

251
00:21:03,481 --> 00:21:04,881
I'm not blind.

252
00:21:18,029 --> 00:21:20,297
You think
she's pretty, too.

253
00:21:23,368 --> 00:21:25,602
I'm looking forward
to our wedding night.

254
00:21:25,636 --> 00:21:29,406
But don't worry,
I'll have plenty of time for you.

255
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:32,009
Perhaps I'll marry, too.

256
00:21:36,881 --> 00:21:40,017
You're the kennel
master's daughter.

257
00:21:40,051 --> 00:21:43,253
Who are you going to marry,
the stable keeper's son?

258
00:21:49,494 --> 00:21:51,428
You're mine.

259
00:21:52,530 --> 00:21:54,498
You're not going
anywhere.

260
00:21:54,532 --> 00:21:56,767
Unless I have to listen
to more of your jealousy.

261
00:21:56,801 --> 00:21:57,706
Jealousy bores me.

262
00:21:57,730 --> 00:21:59,699
You remember what happens
to people who bore me.

263
00:22:02,807 --> 00:22:06,710
You're not going to bore me,
are you, Myranda?

264
00:22:25,096 --> 00:22:26,696
Never.

265
00:22:53,524 --> 00:22:55,192
Beg pardon, my lady.

266
00:22:55,226 --> 00:22:57,561
I've come to refill
the wash basin.

267
00:22:57,595 --> 00:22:59,463
Oh, I don't need--

268
00:23:00,665 --> 00:23:03,033
You still have
friends in the North.

269
00:23:03,067 --> 00:23:05,102
If you're ever
in trouble,

270
00:23:05,136 --> 00:23:08,705
light a candle in the highest window
of the broken tower.

271
00:23:09,841 --> 00:23:12,342
- But who--
- You're not alone.

272
00:23:50,047 --> 00:23:52,282
I like your dress.

273
00:23:53,918 --> 00:23:55,452
Who made it for you?

274
00:23:55,486 --> 00:23:58,121
I made it myself.

275
00:23:58,156 --> 00:24:00,157
Really?

276
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:03,894
Who-- who are you?

277
00:24:03,928 --> 00:24:08,098
I'm Myranda,
the kennel master's daughter.

278
00:24:10,401 --> 00:24:11,701
May I?

279
00:24:18,075 --> 00:24:19,809
Oh, wonderful.

280
00:24:19,844 --> 00:24:21,878
The stitching.

281
00:24:23,214 --> 00:24:25,282
- Who taught you?
- My mother.

282
00:24:26,751 --> 00:24:30,420
I'm sorry for what
happened to her.

283
00:24:30,454 --> 00:24:31,755
Thank you.

284
00:24:33,524 --> 00:24:35,692
It's good
that she taught you.

285
00:24:35,726 --> 00:24:37,227
It was a gift.

286
00:24:37,261 --> 00:24:42,199
Now every time you wear
something you made,

287
00:24:42,233 --> 00:24:44,034
you can remember her.

288
00:24:44,068 --> 00:24:45,569
I'd rather
have a mother.

289
00:24:45,603 --> 00:24:49,339
I know.
It's not the same.

290
00:24:49,373 --> 00:24:53,109
Still, it's good
to remember.

291
00:24:53,144 --> 00:24:55,278
Remember the way
things were.

292
00:24:57,014 --> 00:24:59,516
I almost forgot.

293
00:24:59,550 --> 00:25:02,419
There's something else

294
00:25:02,453 --> 00:25:04,821
<i>to help you remember.</i>

295
00:25:14,298 --> 00:25:16,766
Down there
at the end.

296
00:25:18,102 --> 00:25:19,469
What is it?

297
00:25:19,503 --> 00:25:21,404
That would spoil
the surprise.

298
00:25:23,007 --> 00:25:25,842
Go ahead,
it's perfectly safe.

299
00:25:25,876 --> 00:25:28,044
You won't believe it
when you see it.

300
00:26:30,574 --> 00:26:31,941
Theon?

301
00:26:41,886 --> 00:26:44,254
You shouldn't be here.

302
00:27:04,342 --> 00:27:08,311
You smell particularly
ripe this evening.

303
00:27:11,115 --> 00:27:12,916
Pour me some wine.

304
00:27:37,041 --> 00:27:39,242
Do you have
something to tell me?

305
00:27:40,578 --> 00:27:42,212
No, my lord.

306
00:27:42,246 --> 00:27:43,847
Reek.

307
00:27:47,785 --> 00:27:49,686
She saw me.

308
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:51,221
Who?

309
00:27:51,255 --> 00:27:54,090
Sansa.
Lady Sansa.

310
00:27:54,125 --> 00:27:55,792
She came to the kennels.

311
00:27:57,228 --> 00:27:58,461
She saw you?

312
00:27:58,496 --> 00:28:00,730
Yes.
I'm sorry, master.

313
00:28:00,765 --> 00:28:02,632
Forgive me.
I didn't think--

314
00:28:02,666 --> 00:28:04,634
Come here.

315
00:28:12,910 --> 00:28:15,678
You mustn't keep
secrets from me, Reek.

316
00:28:15,713 --> 00:28:17,547
Get on your knees.

317
00:28:30,060 --> 00:28:31,995
Give me your hand.

318
00:28:54,084 --> 00:28:55,952
I forgive you.

319
00:29:07,131 --> 00:29:10,233
I trust you find your chamber
suitable, my lady.

320
00:29:10,267 --> 00:29:12,435
Yes, thank you,
my lord.

321
00:29:12,470 --> 00:29:14,270
Allow me.

322
00:29:18,075 --> 00:29:19,709
Mother.

323
00:29:19,743 --> 00:29:21,678
Thank you, Ramsay.

324
00:29:31,822 --> 00:29:36,426
My lady, we are all a family,
we northerners.

325
00:29:36,460 --> 00:29:39,896
Our blood ties go back
thousands of years.

326
00:29:39,930 --> 00:29:42,899
So I'd like to drink
to our wedding.

327
00:29:42,933 --> 00:29:46,302
May our happiness
spread from Moat Cailin

328
00:29:46,337 --> 00:29:47,504
to the Last Hearth.

329
00:29:47,538 --> 00:29:49,439
To your wedding.

330
00:29:49,473 --> 00:29:51,407
To your wedding.

331
00:29:57,948 --> 00:30:01,284
It must be difficult
for you being in a strange place.

332
00:30:01,318 --> 00:30:04,153
This isn't a strange place.
This is my home.

333
00:30:04,188 --> 00:30:06,422
It's the people
who are strange.

334
00:30:10,761 --> 00:30:12,562
You're right.

335
00:30:12,596 --> 00:30:14,130
Very strange.

336
00:30:17,368 --> 00:30:18,968
More wine, please.

337
00:30:25,476 --> 00:30:28,211
<i>I heard you two</i>
<i>had been reunited.</i>

338
00:30:28,245 --> 00:30:31,281
A fitting place for it.

339
00:30:33,217 --> 00:30:36,553
I like to imagine that
the last time you spoke

340
00:30:36,587 --> 00:30:38,521
was in this very room.

341
00:30:41,225 --> 00:30:43,893
<i>Are you still</i>
<i>angry with him</i>

342
00:30:43,928 --> 00:30:45,795
<i>after he...</i>

343
00:30:50,434 --> 00:30:51,634
what he did?

344
00:30:51,669 --> 00:30:54,003
Don't worry.

345
00:30:54,038 --> 00:30:56,205
The North remembers.

346
00:30:57,608 --> 00:30:59,742
I punished him
for it.

347
00:30:59,777 --> 00:31:02,145
He's not ironborn
anymore.

348
00:31:02,179 --> 00:31:05,348
Not Theon Greyjoy anymore.

349
00:31:05,382 --> 00:31:07,216
He's a new man.

350
00:31:08,719 --> 00:31:11,654
A new person, anyway.

351
00:31:11,689 --> 00:31:13,356
Aren't you, Reek?

352
00:31:13,390 --> 00:31:15,058
Yes, master.

353
00:31:15,092 --> 00:31:17,260
That's his
new name-- Reek.

354
00:31:17,294 --> 00:31:19,395
Why are you doing this?

355
00:31:21,298 --> 00:31:24,500
Because Reek has
something to say to you.

356
00:31:24,535 --> 00:31:26,135
Don't you, Reek?

357
00:31:36,347 --> 00:31:38,047
An apology.

358
00:31:43,854 --> 00:31:47,023
Apologize to Lady Sansa
for what you did.

359
00:31:48,359 --> 00:31:51,361
Apologize for murdering
her two brothers.

360
00:31:57,234 --> 00:31:58,835
I'm sorry.

361
00:32:00,237 --> 00:32:02,372
Look at her, Reek.

362
00:32:03,540 --> 00:32:05,241
<i>An apology</i>
<i>doesn't mean anything</i>

363
00:32:05,275 --> 00:32:07,844
<i>if you're not looking</i>
<i>the person in the eye.</i>

364
00:32:14,018 --> 00:32:16,886
- I'm sorry.
<i>- Sorry about what?</i>

365
00:32:18,122 --> 00:32:19,922
For killing your brothers.

366
00:32:30,467 --> 00:32:33,336
There, over and done with.

367
00:32:33,370 --> 00:32:36,873
<i>Doesn't everyone</i>
<i>feel better? I do.</i>

368
00:32:36,907 --> 00:32:39,809
That was getting
very tense.

369
00:32:40,678 --> 00:32:42,412
Whew.

370
00:32:45,249 --> 00:32:48,351
You know what,
my lady?

371
00:32:48,385 --> 00:32:51,220
What with him
having murdered your brothers

372
00:32:51,288 --> 00:32:53,756
and the rest
of your family gone...

373
00:32:55,793 --> 00:32:59,929
Reek here is the nearest
thing to living kin

374
00:32:59,963 --> 00:33:01,964
that you have left.

375
00:33:03,300 --> 00:33:05,268
Reek.

376
00:33:05,302 --> 00:33:07,170
You will give away
the bride.

377
00:33:09,907 --> 00:33:13,509
Someone has to.
What better person?

378
00:33:13,544 --> 00:33:15,011
Good? Good?

379
00:33:15,045 --> 00:33:18,448
Yes, yes, very good.

380
00:33:18,482 --> 00:33:20,483
Wonderful.

381
00:33:22,352 --> 00:33:24,887
Walda and I have
some good news as well,

382
00:33:24,922 --> 00:33:26,689
since we're all together.

383
00:33:32,062 --> 00:33:34,130
We're going
to have a baby.

384
00:33:39,803 --> 00:33:41,637
I'm very happy for you.

385
00:33:41,672 --> 00:33:43,639
From the way
she's carrying,

386
00:33:43,674 --> 00:33:46,542
Maester Wolkan says
it looks like a boy.

387
00:34:01,925 --> 00:34:03,659
<i>How can you be sure?</i>

388
00:34:03,694 --> 00:34:05,895
Sure of what?

389
00:34:05,929 --> 00:34:07,830
That she's pregnant.

390
00:34:07,865 --> 00:34:09,899
I mean...

391
00:34:09,933 --> 00:34:11,601
how can you tell?

392
00:34:11,635 --> 00:34:14,537
Maester Wolkan
has assured us beyond all doubt.

393
00:34:23,113 --> 00:34:26,549
So how did
you manage it?

394
00:34:26,583 --> 00:34:28,417
Manage what?

395
00:34:28,452 --> 00:34:30,820
Getting her pregnant.

396
00:34:30,854 --> 00:34:32,889
I imagine you're familiar
with the procedure.

397
00:34:32,923 --> 00:34:36,025
Of course,
but how did you...

398
00:34:36,059 --> 00:34:37,560
find it?

399
00:34:37,594 --> 00:34:39,929
You disgraced yourself
at dinner

400
00:34:39,963 --> 00:34:42,331
parading that creature
before the Stark girl.

401
00:34:42,366 --> 00:34:44,934
And if it's a boy?

402
00:34:47,137 --> 00:34:48,838
You're worried about
your position.

403
00:34:48,872 --> 00:34:50,940
My position
is quite clear.

404
00:34:50,974 --> 00:34:53,776
I'm your son

405
00:34:53,811 --> 00:34:56,312
until a better
alternative comes along.

406
00:35:05,589 --> 00:35:07,757
You've never asked me
about your mother.

407
00:35:12,262 --> 00:35:14,664
Why would I?

408
00:35:14,698 --> 00:35:17,500
She had me,
she died.

409
00:35:18,669 --> 00:35:20,703
And here we are.

410
00:35:21,672 --> 00:35:23,372
She was a peasant girl.

411
00:35:24,474 --> 00:35:26,175
Pretty in a common
sort of way.

412
00:35:26,210 --> 00:35:28,978
She was the miller's wife.

413
00:35:29,012 --> 00:35:32,648
Apparently they had married without
my knowledge or consent.

414
00:35:32,683 --> 00:35:34,517
So I had him hanged

415
00:35:34,551 --> 00:35:37,453
and I took her beneath the tree
where he was swaying.

416
00:35:37,487 --> 00:35:39,555
She fought me
the whole time.

417
00:35:39,590 --> 00:35:41,757
She was lucky
I didn't hang her, too.

418
00:35:41,792 --> 00:35:44,227
<i>A year later</i>
<i>she came to my gates</i>

419
00:35:44,261 --> 00:35:46,429
<i>with a squalling baby</i>
<i>in her arms.</i>

420
00:35:46,463 --> 00:35:48,631
<i>A baby she claimed</i>
<i>was mine.</i>

421
00:35:48,665 --> 00:35:50,800
I nearly had her whipped

422
00:35:50,834 --> 00:35:52,802
and the child
thrown in the river.

423
00:35:58,175 --> 00:35:59,675
But then I looked at you

424
00:35:59,710 --> 00:36:02,645
<i>and I saw then</i>
<i>what I see now.</i>

425
00:36:02,679 --> 00:36:04,914
You are my son.

426
00:36:16,860 --> 00:36:20,429
Stannis Baratheon has
an army at Castle Black.

427
00:36:20,464 --> 00:36:23,232
But he won't
stay for long.

428
00:36:23,267 --> 00:36:25,902
He wants the Iron Throne,

429
00:36:25,936 --> 00:36:29,372
and the road to King's Landing comes
right through Winterfell.

430
00:36:30,841 --> 00:36:33,409
He means to take the North.

431
00:36:35,078 --> 00:36:37,313
But the North is ours.

432
00:36:37,347 --> 00:36:39,482
It's yours and mine.

433
00:36:40,484 --> 00:36:43,085
Will you help me
defeat him?

434
00:36:44,621 --> 00:36:46,455
Yes.

435
00:36:54,164 --> 00:36:56,599
Is this every
book there is?

436
00:36:57,768 --> 00:36:59,535
Every book there is?

437
00:37:00,671 --> 00:37:03,739
- In the world.
- Well, no.

438
00:37:03,774 --> 00:37:07,777
There are thousands
and thousands of books out there.

439
00:37:07,811 --> 00:37:10,046
This library is rather
small, actually.

440
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:11,747
Where you grew up,
were there more books?

441
00:37:11,782 --> 00:37:14,617
My father's not
the most literate man.

442
00:37:16,987 --> 00:37:20,623
They say the Citadel
has the largest library in the world.

443
00:37:20,657 --> 00:37:22,091
Where's that?

444
00:37:23,260 --> 00:37:25,795
The Citadel?

445
00:37:25,829 --> 00:37:27,563
In Oldtown.

446
00:37:33,737 --> 00:37:35,671
I'm sorry
I don't know things.

447
00:37:35,706 --> 00:37:38,774
Oh, Gilly,
look at me.

448
00:37:38,809 --> 00:37:42,745
<i>You know how to do</i>
<i>a hundred things I can never do.</i>

449
00:37:42,779 --> 00:37:45,047
You can build a fire
with wet wood.

450
00:37:45,082 --> 00:37:47,516
You can cook.
You can stitch a wound.

451
00:37:47,551 --> 00:37:50,579
I can wash the linens.
I can sweep the floor.

452
00:37:50,580 --> 00:37:51,273
Well...

453
00:37:51,297 --> 00:37:53,624
Why does the Citadel have
the biggest library?

454
00:37:53,657 --> 00:37:56,792
<i>It's where they train</i>
<i>the maesters.</i>

455
00:37:56,827 --> 00:37:58,361
Like Maester Aemon?

456
00:37:58,395 --> 00:38:01,163
I wanted to be one
when I was young.

457
00:38:03,734 --> 00:38:07,970
Instead, I became a man
of the Night's Watch.

458
00:38:10,974 --> 00:38:13,376
Far more adventure
up here anyway.

459
00:38:15,278 --> 00:38:17,079
I wouldn't have met you.

460
00:38:22,552 --> 00:38:24,887
Ah, Your Grace.

461
00:38:32,295 --> 00:38:34,530
You're Samwell Tarly?

462
00:38:34,564 --> 00:38:37,633
I am,
Your Grace.

463
00:38:37,667 --> 00:38:39,969
Your father
is Randyll Tarly.

464
00:38:42,572 --> 00:38:45,574
He defeated my brother
at the Battle of Ashford.

465
00:38:46,810 --> 00:38:49,779
<i>Only battle</i>
<i>Robert ever lost.</i>

466
00:38:49,813 --> 00:38:53,416
I told him he shouldn't go so far
west so soon, but he never listened.

467
00:38:56,053 --> 00:38:58,621
<i>Fine soldier,</i>
<i>your father.</i>

468
00:38:58,655 --> 00:39:00,723
You don't look
like a soldier.

469
00:39:01,958 --> 00:39:04,727
But I'm told you killed
a white walker.

470
00:39:04,761 --> 00:39:06,595
I did, Your Grace.

471
00:39:06,630 --> 00:39:07,863
<i>How?</i>

472
00:39:07,898 --> 00:39:10,032
With a dagger
made of dragonglass.

473
00:39:10,067 --> 00:39:11,567
Dragonglass?

474
00:39:11,601 --> 00:39:12,935
What the maesters
call obsidian.

475
00:39:12,969 --> 00:39:15,271
I know what it is.
We have it in Dragonstone.

476
00:39:15,305 --> 00:39:17,406
Why would obsidian
kill a walker?

477
00:39:17,441 --> 00:39:19,008
I don't know.

478
00:39:19,042 --> 00:39:20,843
I've been going through
all the old manuscripts

479
00:39:20,877 --> 00:39:23,145
hoping to find something,
and all I've learned

480
00:39:23,180 --> 00:39:26,649
is that the children of the forest
used to hunt with dragonglass.

481
00:39:26,683 --> 00:39:30,352
The Lady Melisandre
told me that death marches on the Wall.

482
00:39:33,323 --> 00:39:35,391
I've seen it,
Your Grace.

483
00:39:35,425 --> 00:39:36,892
Seen what?

484
00:39:36,927 --> 00:39:39,795
The army of the dead.

485
00:39:39,830 --> 00:39:43,499
- And when they come--
- We have to know how to fight them.

486
00:39:47,237 --> 00:39:49,805
Keep reading,
Samwell Tarly.

487
00:40:07,157 --> 00:40:08,958
It's time.

488
00:40:08,992 --> 00:40:11,260
Uh, Your Grace.

489
00:40:11,294 --> 00:40:13,796
Wouldn't it
be better to wait?

490
00:40:13,830 --> 00:40:17,066
When Jon Snow returns with the wildlings,
we could have thousands more men.

491
00:40:17,100 --> 00:40:18,567
If Jon Snow returns
with the wildlings.

492
00:40:18,602 --> 00:40:20,302
We can't wait that long.

493
00:40:20,337 --> 00:40:23,906
We have the advantage--
more men, more horses, all fed and rested.

494
00:40:23,940 --> 00:40:26,942
<i>But every day we wait,</i>
<i>the odds shift in Bolton's favor.</i>

495
00:40:26,977 --> 00:40:29,044
This could turn to winter
at any moment.

496
00:40:29,079 --> 00:40:30,880
We have to act now.
Give the order.

497
00:40:30,914 --> 00:40:32,414
We march at sunrise.

498
00:40:32,449 --> 00:40:34,183
I'll choose
a dozen men to stay

499
00:40:34,217 --> 00:40:36,652
and guard the queen
and the princess.

500
00:40:36,686 --> 00:40:38,254
No need.
They're coming with us.

501
00:40:40,257 --> 00:40:42,291
It's a tough road ahead,
Your Grace.

502
00:40:42,325 --> 00:40:45,060
- Won't they be safer--
- Here?

503
00:40:45,613 --> 00:40:49,282
Half these watchmen
are killers and rapists.

504
00:40:50,384 --> 00:40:52,252
No, they march with us.

505
00:40:55,423 --> 00:40:57,424
As you wish,
Your Grace.

506
00:41:22,950 --> 00:41:25,652
<i>Do you think Father will let</i>
<i>me go down into the crypt?</i>

507
00:41:25,686 --> 00:41:27,287
Beg your pardon?

508
00:41:27,321 --> 00:41:29,089
At Winterfell.

509
00:41:29,123 --> 00:41:31,157
All the Kings in the North
are buried there.

510
00:41:31,192 --> 00:41:32,959
Bran the Builder
and King Dorren and--

511
00:41:32,993 --> 00:41:35,361
First things first.
It's a long march ahead.

512
00:41:35,396 --> 00:41:37,363
And then we have
to take the castle.

513
00:41:37,398 --> 00:41:38,832
Is there going
to be a battle?

514
00:41:38,866 --> 00:41:41,334
Aye, princess, but you
won't be anywhere near--

515
00:41:41,368 --> 00:41:44,571
That's enough talk
of battle, Ser Davos.

516
00:41:44,605 --> 00:41:46,039
You'll scare the child.

517
00:41:46,073 --> 00:41:48,508
<i>Yes, my queen.</i>

518
00:41:50,878 --> 00:41:53,847
- I'm not scared.
- Well, I am.

519
00:41:53,914 --> 00:41:56,850
When the battle comes,
promise you'll protect me.

520
00:41:56,917 --> 00:41:58,952
I promise.

521
00:42:18,773 --> 00:42:22,208
I hope you know what you're doing
with these wildlings.

522
00:42:22,243 --> 00:42:24,611
I need those ships.

523
00:42:25,646 --> 00:42:28,815
You'll get them back,
I swear it.

524
00:42:30,351 --> 00:42:32,719
Have a safe journey,
Your Grace.

525
00:42:33,721 --> 00:42:35,555
And thank you.

526
00:43:04,351 --> 00:43:06,186
<i>Mount up!</i>

527
00:43:06,220 --> 00:43:08,254
<i>Colors!</i>

528
00:43:57,738 --> 00:43:59,739
No.

529
00:43:59,773 --> 00:44:01,708
You're still too weak.

530
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:14,220
Ser Barristan?

531
00:44:40,014 --> 00:44:42,248
<i>Are you ashamed?</i>

532
00:44:43,817 --> 00:44:46,319
<i>You were ambushed,</i>
<i>outnumbered.</i>

533
00:44:46,353 --> 00:44:48,254
<i>There was no way</i>
<i>you could have known.</i>

534
00:44:48,289 --> 00:44:50,356
This is not why.

535
00:44:52,793 --> 00:44:55,028
Wounded in war,

536
00:44:55,062 --> 00:44:58,398
there is no shame
for this.

537
00:44:58,432 --> 00:45:00,566
I am ashamed

538
00:45:00,601 --> 00:45:03,169
because when
the knife go in

539
00:45:03,203 --> 00:45:06,539
and I fall to the ground,

540
00:45:06,573 --> 00:45:08,508
I am afraid.

541
00:45:10,044 --> 00:45:12,111
All men fear death.

542
00:45:12,146 --> 00:45:14,948
No, not death.

543
00:45:17,518 --> 00:45:20,186
I fear

544
00:45:20,220 --> 00:45:25,692
I never again see Missandei
from the Island of Naath.

545
00:46:01,095 --> 00:46:04,263
Now you have given the Masters
what they deserve.

546
00:46:04,298 --> 00:46:05,832
If I give everyone
what they deserve,

547
00:46:05,866 --> 00:46:08,034
I'll have no one
left to rule.

548
00:46:08,068 --> 00:46:10,603
Ser Barristan
counseled mercy

549
00:46:10,637 --> 00:46:13,306
when I took this city right up
to the morning he died.

550
00:46:13,340 --> 00:46:16,142
<i>Daario Naharis thinks I should kill</i>
<i>the former Masters</i>

551
00:46:16,176 --> 00:46:18,778
<i>and let the rest</i>
<i>of the city fend for itself.</i>

552
00:46:19,813 --> 00:46:21,581
What do you think?

553
00:46:23,017 --> 00:46:25,151
Your Grace, I think
that I am not fit

554
00:46:25,185 --> 00:46:27,587
to have an opinion
on these matters.

555
00:46:27,621 --> 00:46:30,056
You are as fit
as anyone I know.

556
00:46:31,492 --> 00:46:33,726
You know why I'm here.

557
00:46:33,761 --> 00:46:36,829
And you know who will suffer the most
if this all falls apart.

558
00:46:36,864 --> 00:46:40,033
<i>So what do you think?</i>

559
00:46:42,269 --> 00:46:45,772
I can only tell you
what I have seen, Your Grace.

560
00:46:45,806 --> 00:46:49,108
I have seen you listen
to your counselors.

561
00:46:50,811 --> 00:46:54,447
I have seen you lean on their experience
when your own was lacking

562
00:46:54,481 --> 00:46:59,185
and weigh the choices
they put before you.

563
00:46:59,219 --> 00:47:02,221
And I have seen you
ignore your counselors...

564
00:47:05,092 --> 00:47:07,593
because there was
a better choice.

565
00:47:07,628 --> 00:47:09,996
One that only
you could see.

566
00:47:26,713 --> 00:47:29,949
My-- my queen,
please do not do this.

567
00:47:29,983 --> 00:47:31,951
<i>What about</i>
<i>"valar morghulis"?</i>

568
00:47:31,985 --> 00:47:34,554
I did not want
to die a coward.

569
00:47:39,293 --> 00:47:41,928
Apparently I do not
want to die at all.

570
00:47:43,797 --> 00:47:46,265
It takes courage
to admit fear.

571
00:47:47,668 --> 00:47:49,969
And to admit a mistake.

572
00:47:51,438 --> 00:47:54,073
I came here to tell you
that I was wrong.

573
00:47:56,944 --> 00:47:59,579
I was wrong
and you were right.

574
00:48:01,548 --> 00:48:03,649
About tradition.

575
00:48:05,085 --> 00:48:07,920
About bringing the people
of this city together.

576
00:48:11,291 --> 00:48:13,526
I will reopen
the fighting pits.

577
00:48:14,461 --> 00:48:16,062
To free men only.

578
00:48:16,096 --> 00:48:20,299
Slavery will never
return to Meereen, not while I live.

579
00:48:20,334 --> 00:48:22,435
Yes, my queen.

580
00:48:25,806 --> 00:48:29,775
And in order to forge a lasting bond with
the Meereenese people,

581
00:48:29,810 --> 00:48:32,612
I will marry the leader
of an ancient family.

582
00:48:34,848 --> 00:48:37,884
Thankfully a suitor
is already on his knees.

583
00:49:06,013 --> 00:49:07,813
Don't worry.

584
00:49:07,848 --> 00:49:11,317
I'll be fine.
Nothing broken, I don't think.

585
00:49:13,487 --> 00:49:15,288
Where are we now?

586
00:49:15,322 --> 00:49:17,423
Not the Rhoyne.

587
00:49:23,463 --> 00:49:26,132
Long, sullen silences

588
00:49:26,166 --> 00:49:29,168
and an occasional
punch in the face.

589
00:49:30,971 --> 00:49:33,072
The Mormont way.

590
00:49:36,543 --> 00:49:39,312
Let's start over.

591
00:49:40,514 --> 00:49:42,915
I apologize for before.

592
00:49:42,950 --> 00:49:45,952
<i>My mouth sometimes</i>
<i>runs away from me.</i>

593
00:49:45,986 --> 00:49:48,888
This doesn't have to be
an unpleasant trip.

594
00:49:53,694 --> 00:49:56,829
We're going to be spending a lot of time
together on the way to Meereen.

595
00:49:56,863 --> 00:49:58,231
We are.

596
00:50:00,067 --> 00:50:03,402
What would make our time
together truly enjoyable

597
00:50:03,437 --> 00:50:04,937
would be some wine.

598
00:50:05,806 --> 00:50:07,273
No wine.

599
00:50:09,943 --> 00:50:13,479
I am a person who drinks.

600
00:50:15,148 --> 00:50:17,483
People who drink
need to keep drinking.

601
00:50:17,517 --> 00:50:19,552
<i>Otherwise,</i>
<i>they're not...</i>

602
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:28,494
I know where we are.

603
00:50:28,528 --> 00:50:31,030
You're taking us
through Valyria.

604
00:50:31,064 --> 00:50:32,398
I am.

605
00:50:32,432 --> 00:50:34,634
Have you sailed
this route before?

606
00:50:34,668 --> 00:50:36,202
No.

607
00:50:36,236 --> 00:50:38,204
You're going to bring
Daenerys a souvenir

608
00:50:38,238 --> 00:50:40,439
from her ancestral homeland
in case I'm not enough?

609
00:50:40,474 --> 00:50:43,042
I think you'll be plenty.

610
00:50:44,177 --> 00:50:46,245
<i>You know what they say.</i>

611
00:50:46,280 --> 00:50:49,515
The Doom
still rules Valyria.

612
00:50:49,549 --> 00:50:52,451
What about the demons
and the flames?

613
00:50:53,654 --> 00:50:55,354
<i>Aren't you afraid</i>
<i>of the Doom?</i>

614
00:50:55,389 --> 00:50:57,189
<i>No.</i>

615
00:50:57,224 --> 00:50:59,659
But pirates are.

616
00:51:00,527 --> 00:51:02,161
Oh.

617
00:51:05,065 --> 00:51:08,601
The Smoking Sea.

618
00:51:08,635 --> 00:51:10,603
How many centuries
before we learn

619
00:51:10,637 --> 00:51:13,706
how to build cities
like this again?

620
00:51:13,740 --> 00:51:16,542
For thousands of years
the Valyrians were

621
00:51:16,576 --> 00:51:20,413
the best in the world
at almost everything.

622
00:51:20,447 --> 00:51:22,381
And then...

623
00:51:22,416 --> 00:51:25,184
And then they weren't.

624
00:51:25,218 --> 00:51:26,852
And then they weren't.

625
00:51:30,090 --> 00:51:34,260
"They held each other close
and turned their backs upon the end.

626
00:51:34,294 --> 00:51:37,296
<i>The hills</i>
<i>that split asunder</i>

627
00:51:37,331 --> 00:51:40,132
and the black
that ate the skies;

628
00:51:40,167 --> 00:51:42,535
The flames that shot
so high and hot

629
00:51:42,569 --> 00:51:44,103
that even dragons burned;

630
00:51:44,137 --> 00:51:46,305
Would never be
the final sights

631
00:51:46,340 --> 00:51:48,674
that fell upon
their eyes.

632
00:51:49,843 --> 00:51:51,744
A fly upon a wall,

633
00:51:51,778 --> 00:51:55,748
the waves the sea wind
whipped and churned--"

634
00:51:55,782 --> 00:51:58,684
"The city
of a thousand years,

635
00:51:58,719 --> 00:52:00,619
and all that men
had learned;

636
00:52:00,654 --> 00:52:04,123
The Doom consumed
it all alike,

637
00:52:04,157 --> 00:52:06,859
and neither
of them turned."

638
00:52:09,162 --> 00:52:11,964
I would clap.

639
00:52:17,003 --> 00:52:19,372
I suppose
this is it, then.

640
00:52:20,540 --> 00:52:22,675
This is what remains.

641
00:53:02,349 --> 00:53:03,616
What was that?

642
00:53:10,157 --> 00:53:12,525
Stone Men!

643
00:53:12,559 --> 00:53:14,460
Don't let them
touch you!

644
00:53:30,710 --> 00:53:32,411
Get behind!

645
00:53:34,815 --> 00:53:37,383
Mormont, cut me free!

646
00:53:37,417 --> 00:53:39,585
Mormont!

647
00:53:54,367 --> 00:53:56,268
Mormont!

648
00:53:56,303 --> 00:53:58,404
Mormont!

649
00:54:33,807 --> 00:54:35,875
Tyrion?

650
00:54:38,712 --> 00:54:41,213
Tyrion.

651
00:54:41,248 --> 00:54:42,915
Tyrion.

652
00:54:44,351 --> 00:54:46,318
Tyrion.

653
00:54:47,821 --> 00:54:49,622
You're all right.

654
00:54:59,199 --> 00:55:01,534
You're heavier
than you look.

655
00:55:04,037 --> 00:55:06,372
Did any of them
touch you?

656
00:55:09,109 --> 00:55:10,976
You?

657
00:55:15,949 --> 00:55:18,884
I've seen
greyscale before,

658
00:55:18,919 --> 00:55:20,352
but nothing like that.

659
00:55:20,387 --> 00:55:23,322
I suppose that's why
they send them there.

660
00:55:25,325 --> 00:55:28,494
It'd be kinder to put daggers
in their hearts and be done with it.

661
00:55:32,732 --> 00:55:35,968
Thank you for saving me.

662
00:55:39,306 --> 00:55:41,473
Of course, I wouldn't
have needed saving

663
00:55:41,508 --> 00:55:43,475
if you hadn't kidnapped me
in the first place.

664
00:55:47,981 --> 00:55:50,115
So what now?

665
00:55:50,150 --> 00:55:52,251
We walk
up the coast.

666
00:55:52,285 --> 00:55:54,119
With luck, we'll find
a fishing village.

667
00:55:54,154 --> 00:55:56,155
Maybe another boat.

668
00:55:56,189 --> 00:55:58,457
Without luck?

669
00:55:58,491 --> 00:56:01,160
We've got a long walk
ahead of us.

670
00:56:03,096 --> 00:56:06,231
I'll get some wood
for a fire.

671
00:56:06,266 --> 00:56:09,034
Try to get
some rest, huh?

672
00:56:09,069 --> 00:56:11,804
That's the best idea
you've had all day.
