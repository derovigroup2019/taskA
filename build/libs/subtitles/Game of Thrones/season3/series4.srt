1
00:00:01,062 --> 00:00:02,087
Why are you helping him?

2
00:00:02,088 --> 00:00:03,792
He takes us prisoner
and now he's our friend?

3
00:00:03,826 --> 00:00:05,397
<i>You're not our prisoner,</i>
<i>little lady.</i>

4
00:00:05,431 --> 00:00:06,800
You're lucky we found you.

5
00:00:06,834 --> 00:00:08,938
<i>These woods aren't safe</i>
<i>for Ned Stark's daughter.</i>

6
00:00:10,209 --> 00:00:11,912
Ride east.
Your sister's waiting for you.

7
00:00:11,947 --> 00:00:13,783
Come on.
Come on.

8
00:00:13,818 --> 00:00:15,454
I'm waiting for word
on an assignment

9
00:00:15,488 --> 00:00:17,392
that will take me far away
from the capital.

10
00:00:17,426 --> 00:00:20,832
- I might be able to take you with me.
<i>- Watch out for her.</i>

11
00:00:20,866 --> 00:00:22,569
Watch out for her
with him.

12
00:00:22,603 --> 00:00:25,709
The Lord of Harrenhal will make a
worthy suitor for the widow Arryn.

13
00:00:25,743 --> 00:00:26,888
My lord.

14
00:00:26,913 --> 00:00:29,105
<i>You'll leave for the Eyrie</i>
<i>as soon as possible.</i>

15
00:00:29,485 --> 00:00:32,424
I'm Jojen Reed.
This is my sister Meera.

16
00:00:32,458 --> 00:00:34,628
We've come a long way
to find you, Brandon.

17
00:00:34,663 --> 00:00:36,566
And we have
much farther to go.

18
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:39,572
What have we here?
Frozen crows?

19
00:00:39,606 --> 00:00:42,712
Bet you feed that pig
better than you feed us.

20
00:00:42,746 --> 00:00:44,382
That pig's got
value to me.

21
00:00:45,386 --> 00:00:48,022
What is it?

22
00:00:51,297 --> 00:00:53,232
Yah!

23
00:00:56,439 --> 00:00:57,907
Come, my lord.

24
00:00:57,941 --> 00:01:00,211
You're a long way from home
and winter is coming.

25
00:01:00,245 --> 00:01:02,247
I want to buy them all.
8,000.

26
00:01:02,282 --> 00:01:05,387
Master Kraznys says
you cannot afford this.

27
00:01:05,422 --> 00:01:07,391
I have dragons.

28
00:01:07,425 --> 00:01:09,227
<i>They want</i>
<i>the biggest one.</i>

29
00:01:09,252 --> 00:01:10,496
Done.

30
00:01:10,497 --> 00:01:12,801
I'll take you as well, now.

31
00:01:12,835 --> 00:01:16,374
You think you're
the smartest man there is.

32
00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:17,643
And if you get
in any trouble,

33
00:01:17,677 --> 00:01:20,648
all you've got to do
is say "my father."

34
00:01:20,683 --> 00:01:23,019
You're nothing
without your daddy.

35
00:01:23,053 --> 00:01:24,488
Never forget that.

36
00:01:24,523 --> 00:01:27,594
Here, this should
help you remember.

37
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:43,439

39
00:01:48,489 --> 00:03:18,523
?

40
00:03:34,865 --> 00:03:36,933
<i>How many of those fingers</i>

41
00:03:36,967 --> 00:03:39,368
<i>do you think we could</i>
<i>shove up his ass?</i>

42
00:03:39,403 --> 00:03:41,137
<i>Depends if he's had</i>
<i>any practice.</i>

43
00:03:41,171 --> 00:03:45,140
Is that the sort of thing you and
your sister go in for, Kingslayer?

44
00:03:45,174 --> 00:03:48,910
She loosened you up for us?

45
00:03:55,350 --> 00:03:57,351
He's going to fall.

46
00:03:57,385 --> 00:03:59,987
He's going to fall off his horse.
Someone help him.

47
00:04:09,228 --> 00:04:11,062
Water.

48
00:04:11,096 --> 00:04:13,097
Water.

49
00:04:13,131 --> 00:04:15,732
Please, water.

50
00:04:16,601 --> 00:04:18,268
Wa-water.

51
00:04:18,302 --> 00:04:19,936
Water, please.

52
00:04:19,970 --> 00:04:21,870
Please. Please.

53
00:04:29,445 --> 00:04:31,412
If I die,
you won't be getting--

54
00:04:31,447 --> 00:04:32,880
Oh, enough.

55
00:04:32,914 --> 00:04:35,015
Here.

56
00:04:40,854 --> 00:04:44,222
Can't say that I've ever seen a
man drink horse piss that fast.

57
00:05:11,314 --> 00:05:13,515
Stop!

58
00:05:21,289 --> 00:05:22,822
Far enough.

59
00:05:53,147 --> 00:05:56,850
Do that again
and I'll take your other hand.

60
00:06:00,688 --> 00:06:03,089
Come on, you.

61
00:06:12,932 --> 00:06:15,399
Oh, Lord Tyrion.
Come in, come in.

62
00:06:15,433 --> 00:06:17,535
I hope we might speak.

63
00:06:18,470 --> 00:06:20,237
In confidence.

64
00:06:20,271 --> 00:06:23,173
Oh, always in confidence.

65
00:06:23,208 --> 00:06:24,942
About the events
of the Blackwater.

66
00:06:26,578 --> 00:06:27,944
Perhaps this is
the wrong time?

67
00:06:27,979 --> 00:06:29,847
Oh, no.
It's a wonderful time.

68
00:06:30,915 --> 00:06:32,549
I thought one
of your little birds

69
00:06:32,584 --> 00:06:35,351
might have knowledge of
my sister's intentions to--

70
00:06:35,386 --> 00:06:36,853
End your life?

71
00:06:36,887 --> 00:06:39,722
I didn't inherit
Littlefinger's spies

72
00:06:39,756 --> 00:06:41,290
along with his position,
I'm afraid.

73
00:06:41,324 --> 00:06:43,358
Which is why
I'm coming to you.

74
00:06:43,393 --> 00:06:45,627
- I need proof.
- Proof?

75
00:06:45,661 --> 00:06:48,062
- Will there be a trial?
- I need to know.

76
00:06:49,098 --> 00:06:52,199
I have no proof,
only whispers.

77
00:06:55,770 --> 00:06:58,805
Before all this nastiness,

78
00:06:58,839 --> 00:07:02,408
I was going to tell you
the story of how I was cut.

79
00:07:02,443 --> 00:07:04,144
Do you want
to hear it still?

80
00:07:04,178 --> 00:07:06,579
I don't know.
Do I?

81
00:07:06,613 --> 00:07:09,348
As a boy, I travelled
with a troupe of actors

82
00:07:09,382 --> 00:07:11,350
through the Free Cities.

83
00:07:11,385 --> 00:07:13,152
One day in Myr,

84
00:07:13,186 --> 00:07:16,021
a certain man
made my master an offer

85
00:07:16,055 --> 00:07:18,123
too tempting to refuse.

86
00:07:18,157 --> 00:07:20,725
I feared the man meant
to use me as I'd heard

87
00:07:20,759 --> 00:07:22,760
some men used small boys.

88
00:07:22,794 --> 00:07:25,496
But what he wanted
was far worse.

89
00:07:26,765 --> 00:07:28,165
He gave me a potion

90
00:07:28,199 --> 00:07:30,300
that made me powerless
to move or speak,

91
00:07:30,334 --> 00:07:33,336
yet did nothing
to dull my senses.

92
00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:35,771
With a hooked blade
he sliced me,

93
00:07:35,806 --> 00:07:38,741
root and stem,
chanting all the while.

94
00:07:38,775 --> 00:07:42,377
He burned my parts
in a brazier.

95
00:07:42,412 --> 00:07:43,946
The flames turned blue

96
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:47,649
and I heard a voice
answer his call.

97
00:07:52,554 --> 00:07:56,156
I still dream of that night.

98
00:07:56,191 --> 00:07:58,625
Not of the sorcerer,

99
00:07:58,660 --> 00:08:00,927
not of his blade.

100
00:08:00,962 --> 00:08:03,396
I dream of the voice
from the flames.

101
00:08:03,431 --> 00:08:05,632
Was it a god?
A demon?

102
00:08:05,666 --> 00:08:07,334
A conjuror's trick?

103
00:08:07,368 --> 00:08:09,502
I don't know.

104
00:08:09,537 --> 00:08:13,006
But the sorcerer called
and a voice answered.

105
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:15,441
And ever since that day,

106
00:08:15,476 --> 00:08:19,245
I have hated magic and
all those who practice it.

107
00:08:19,279 --> 00:08:21,681
But you can see
why I was eager to aid

108
00:08:21,715 --> 00:08:25,083
in your fight against
Stannis and his Red Priestess.

109
00:08:25,118 --> 00:08:28,820
A symbolic revenge of sorts.

110
00:08:28,854 --> 00:08:32,890
Yes, ahem. I feel the
need for actual revenge

111
00:08:32,924 --> 00:08:34,925
against the actual person

112
00:08:34,959 --> 00:08:37,459
who tried
to have me killed.

113
00:08:37,494 --> 00:08:40,829
Which will require a degree
of influence, which--

114
00:08:40,863 --> 00:08:43,197
You do not possess

115
00:08:43,232 --> 00:08:45,933
at the moment.

116
00:08:45,968 --> 00:08:48,269
But influence is largely

117
00:08:48,303 --> 00:08:51,438
a matter of patience,
I have found.

118
00:08:51,472 --> 00:08:54,841
Once I had served
the sorcerer's purpose,

119
00:08:54,875 --> 00:08:57,443
he threw me out
of his house to die.

120
00:08:57,478 --> 00:09:00,213
I resolved to live

121
00:09:00,247 --> 00:09:01,680
to spite him.

122
00:09:01,715 --> 00:09:03,248
<i>I begged.</i>

123
00:09:03,283 --> 00:09:06,484
I sold what parts
of my body remained to me.

124
00:09:06,518 --> 00:09:08,853
I became
an excellent thief

125
00:09:08,887 --> 00:09:12,255
and soon learned that the
contents of a man's letters

126
00:09:12,290 --> 00:09:16,358
<i>are more valuable</i>
<i>than the contents of his purse.</i>

127
00:09:16,393 --> 00:09:18,828
Step by step,

128
00:09:18,862 --> 00:09:21,630
one distasteful task
after another,

129
00:09:21,664 --> 00:09:25,133
I made my way
from the slums of Myr

130
00:09:25,168 --> 00:09:28,403
to the small council chamber.

131
00:09:30,373 --> 00:09:33,274
Influence grows like a weed.

132
00:09:34,509 --> 00:09:37,044
I tended mine patiently

133
00:09:37,078 --> 00:09:40,447
until its tendrils
reached from the Red Keep

134
00:09:40,482 --> 00:09:43,817
all the way across
to the far side of the world

135
00:09:43,851 --> 00:09:47,787
where I managed to wrap
them around something

136
00:09:47,821 --> 00:09:49,922
very special.

137
00:09:54,527 --> 00:09:57,595
The sorcerer.

138
00:09:57,629 --> 00:10:01,064
Hello, my old friend.

139
00:10:01,098 --> 00:10:04,266
<i>It's been a long time.</i>

140
00:10:04,301 --> 00:10:07,469
I have no doubt
the revenge you want

141
00:10:07,504 --> 00:10:09,071
will be yours in time...

142
00:10:09,105 --> 00:10:12,140
if you have
the stomach for it.

143
00:10:15,144 --> 00:10:17,544
When people talk about
the Night's Watch,

144
00:10:17,579 --> 00:10:20,013
they never mention
the shoveling.

145
00:10:20,048 --> 00:10:22,282
Or the shit.

146
00:10:22,316 --> 00:10:25,017
They tell you about honor,
pardoning crimes,

147
00:10:25,051 --> 00:10:26,451
and protecting the realm,

148
00:10:26,485 --> 00:10:30,821
but shoveling
really is most of it.

149
00:10:30,856 --> 00:10:34,558
And getting attacked
or killed or worse.

150
00:10:34,592 --> 00:10:37,060
And that. But when you're not
getting attacked or killed,

151
00:10:37,094 --> 00:10:38,394
usually you're shoveling.

152
00:10:38,428 --> 00:10:41,197
Oh, look.

153
00:10:41,231 --> 00:10:42,965
More shit.

154
00:10:44,134 --> 00:10:45,900
I was starting
to wonder what to do

155
00:10:45,935 --> 00:10:47,702
with the rest of my day.

156
00:10:47,737 --> 00:10:50,071
We need to get
out of here.

157
00:10:51,306 --> 00:10:53,607
When the Lord Commander
says we go, we go.

158
00:10:53,642 --> 00:10:56,576
The Lord Commander told us to go
to the Fist of the First Men.

159
00:10:56,611 --> 00:10:59,411
- How'd that turn out for us?
- He had no way of knowing.

160
00:10:59,446 --> 00:11:00,913
We do now.

161
00:11:00,947 --> 00:11:02,648
We know what's out there.

162
00:11:02,682 --> 00:11:05,717
Craster's been out here
surviving.

163
00:11:05,751 --> 00:11:08,353
So he's your
new protector now?

164
00:11:08,387 --> 00:11:09,887
Our good friend Craster?

165
00:11:09,922 --> 00:11:11,622
We're like the sons
he never had.

166
00:11:11,657 --> 00:11:14,225
<i>Mormont isn't</i>
<i>gonna save you.</i>

167
00:11:14,259 --> 00:11:17,595
This lummox here
isn't gonna save you.

168
00:11:17,629 --> 00:11:18,963
When the walkers
come calling,

169
00:11:18,997 --> 00:11:21,665
Craster will serve us up
like so many pigs.

170
00:11:23,168 --> 00:11:25,034
If we want to live...

171
00:11:27,237 --> 00:11:29,671
we'll have to look out
for ourselves.

172
00:11:31,007 --> 00:11:32,974
Shh, shh, shh.

173
00:11:43,549 --> 00:11:46,651
- You woke him.
- I'm sorry.

174
00:11:48,987 --> 00:11:51,121
- He's beautiful.
- Shh!

175
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:57,694
He's beautiful.

176
00:11:57,728 --> 00:11:59,762
<i>Does he have a name?</i>

177
00:11:59,796 --> 00:12:03,398
- No.
- Are you going to give him one?

178
00:12:03,432 --> 00:12:04,966
Why?

179
00:12:08,937 --> 00:12:11,104
Here.

180
00:12:11,139 --> 00:12:11,599
Gilly.

181
00:12:11,624 --> 00:12:13,573
You said to hold it for you
until you came back.

182
00:12:13,574 --> 00:12:15,108
- You're back.
- I wanted you to have it.

183
00:12:15,142 --> 00:12:17,109
I don't want
your stupid thimble.

184
00:12:17,144 --> 00:12:20,412
I want to save my baby's life.
Can you do that?

185
00:12:20,447 --> 00:12:22,481
Can you?

186
00:12:24,317 --> 00:12:26,417
I don't have time
for you.

187
00:12:26,452 --> 00:12:28,752
I don't have time
for anyone but him

188
00:12:28,787 --> 00:12:31,989
because he doesn't
have much time.

189
00:12:57,078 --> 00:12:59,412
You have to go
after him.

190
00:12:59,446 --> 00:13:01,314
How?

191
00:13:01,348 --> 00:13:03,415
<i>You know how.</i>

192
00:13:26,538 --> 00:13:29,239
Brandon.

193
00:13:29,273 --> 00:13:29,942
Mother.

194
00:13:29,967 --> 00:13:31,423
How many times
have I told you?

195
00:13:32,710 --> 00:13:35,111
- No climbing.
- Mother, I need to find it.

196
00:13:35,145 --> 00:13:36,879
- It's here. It's calling me.
- I want you to promise me.

197
00:13:36,913 --> 00:13:38,847
No more climbing.
Promise me.

198
00:13:38,881 --> 00:13:40,548
Promise me!
Promise me!

199
00:13:40,582 --> 00:13:42,884
- Mother! Mother!
- Promise me! Promise me, Bran!

200
00:13:42,918 --> 00:13:44,152
<i>Promise me!</i>

201
00:13:57,532 --> 00:13:59,499
Is he very large?

202
00:13:59,534 --> 00:14:01,301
No larger than usual,
apparently.

203
00:14:01,335 --> 00:14:04,370
- And yet they said that he was--
- Extraordinary.

204
00:14:04,404 --> 00:14:07,006
The most extraordinary man
they've ever had.

205
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:08,473
And they've had
a lot of men.

206
00:14:08,508 --> 00:14:10,508
We're talking about
the same Podrick?

207
00:14:10,543 --> 00:14:13,077
The quiet boy
in Lord Tyrion's service?

208
00:14:13,112 --> 00:14:14,679
Seems a bit simple?

209
00:14:16,281 --> 00:14:17,715
What did he do to them?

210
00:14:17,749 --> 00:14:19,015
I don't know, my lord.

211
00:14:19,050 --> 00:14:21,418
The girls are usually
quite descriptive.

212
00:14:21,452 --> 00:14:23,386
So what did they say?

213
00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:26,455
They said it was hard
to describe.

214
00:14:26,490 --> 00:14:28,057
Huh.

215
00:14:28,091 --> 00:14:32,828
Prodigies appear
in the oddest of places.

216
00:14:32,862 --> 00:14:37,065
And what did Littlefinger say
about this loss of income?

217
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:39,167
He was too preoccupied
to notice.

218
00:14:39,201 --> 00:14:41,502
He's leaving
for the Eyrie soon.

219
00:14:41,536 --> 00:14:43,036
I'm helping him prepare
for his journey.

220
00:14:43,071 --> 00:14:45,671
Ah, yes, to pursue
his enduring love

221
00:14:45,706 --> 00:14:49,208
of the Lady Arryn and the
title that comes with her.

222
00:14:49,242 --> 00:14:51,343
Sad, really.

223
00:14:51,377 --> 00:14:53,344
Is that all it takes

224
00:14:53,378 --> 00:14:56,480
to make our friend lose
interest in poor Sansa Stark?

225
00:14:57,749 --> 00:15:00,050
He hasn't spoken to her
since the last time,

226
00:15:00,085 --> 00:15:01,885
as far as I know.

227
00:15:01,919 --> 00:15:04,554
But I don't think
he's lost interest.

228
00:15:04,588 --> 00:15:06,689
What makes you say so?

229
00:15:08,392 --> 00:15:11,093
- His shipboard inventory.
- Ah.

230
00:15:12,895 --> 00:15:14,396
You can read.

231
00:15:14,430 --> 00:15:16,497
Rare for a woman
in your profession.

232
00:15:16,532 --> 00:15:19,532
- Former profession.
- Of course.

233
00:15:19,567 --> 00:15:23,135
I'm missing something obvious
you're about to point out?

234
00:15:23,170 --> 00:15:25,070
<i>Two featherbeds.</i>

235
00:15:25,105 --> 00:15:27,639
He's bringing two featherbeds
for the cabin.

236
00:15:29,442 --> 00:15:31,977
Who is important enough
to Littlefinger

237
00:15:32,011 --> 00:15:34,813
to merit a featherbed
besides Littlefinger?

238
00:15:34,847 --> 00:15:37,082
Could he be bringing
one of his girls?

239
00:15:37,116 --> 00:15:39,417
He's not interested
in them, my lord.

240
00:15:39,452 --> 00:15:41,186
How do you know?

241
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:43,621
Because I'm one
of his girls.

242
00:15:43,655 --> 00:15:47,090
Prodigies in
odd places indeed.

243
00:15:48,459 --> 00:15:51,628
Rhaenyra Targaryen
was murdered by her brother,

244
00:15:51,662 --> 00:15:54,130
or rather his dragon.

245
00:15:54,164 --> 00:15:56,765
It ate her
while her son watched.

246
00:15:58,368 --> 00:16:01,637
What's left of her is buried in
the crypts right down there.

247
00:16:04,407 --> 00:16:07,742
<i>The ceremony is traditionally</i>
<i>held in the main sanctum,</i>

248
00:16:07,777 --> 00:16:11,012
which seats
700 comfortably.

249
00:16:11,046 --> 00:16:13,714
There appears to be a good
deal of room elsewhere

250
00:16:13,748 --> 00:16:16,349
on the premises
for everyone else.

251
00:16:16,383 --> 00:16:19,552
There aren't more than 700
people of any importance.

252
00:16:19,586 --> 00:16:22,721
No, the rest are there
to look adoringly

253
00:16:22,755 --> 00:16:24,789
upon the 700
to remind them

254
00:16:24,824 --> 00:16:27,993
how superior they must be
to have the best seats.

255
00:16:28,027 --> 00:16:29,527
Over there in that urn,

256
00:16:29,562 --> 00:16:31,896
the ashes
of Aerion Targaryen.

257
00:16:31,930 --> 00:16:33,898
Aerion Brightflame
they called him.

258
00:16:33,932 --> 00:16:37,101
He thought drinking wildfire
would turn him into a dragon.

259
00:16:37,135 --> 00:16:40,337
He was wrong.

260
00:16:40,372 --> 00:16:42,406
And, of course,
there's the Mad King,

261
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:44,174
killed by my uncle.

262
00:16:44,209 --> 00:16:47,410
Would you like to see where the
last Targaryens are buried?

263
00:16:47,444 --> 00:16:50,413
Are you sure Lady Margaery doesn't
find all this a bit macabre?

264
00:16:50,447 --> 00:16:52,181
Oh, no, it's quite
all right, Your Grace.

265
00:16:52,215 --> 00:16:54,783
I'd love to see
their tombs, really.

266
00:16:54,817 --> 00:16:57,119
It's like taking a walk
through history.

267
00:17:01,090 --> 00:17:03,391
- The tomb's just up here.
- This is so exciting.

268
00:17:03,425 --> 00:17:05,065
You were married here,
Your Grace?

269
00:17:05,093 --> 00:17:08,261
- Yes.
- Must seem like only yesterday.

270
00:17:08,295 --> 00:17:10,062
Seems like a lifetime ago.

271
00:17:10,097 --> 00:17:12,431
Your husband,
was he buried here as well?

272
00:17:12,465 --> 00:17:15,567
No, he wanted his remains
returned to Storm's End.

273
00:17:15,601 --> 00:17:19,170
- Such a tragedy.
- A fairly predictable tragedy.

274
00:17:19,204 --> 00:17:20,738
Hunting and drinking
don't mix.

275
00:17:20,772 --> 00:17:22,340
I should say not.

276
00:17:22,374 --> 00:17:24,442
My son's a hunter.
It helps him forget

277
00:17:24,476 --> 00:17:27,344
he's never been within
a mile of a real battle.

278
00:17:27,379 --> 00:17:30,347
I seem to recall he laid
siege to Storm's End

279
00:17:30,381 --> 00:17:31,915
for the better part
of a year.

280
00:17:31,949 --> 00:17:33,683
All he laid siege to

281
00:17:33,718 --> 00:17:36,019
was the banquet table
in the command tent.

282
00:17:36,053 --> 00:17:39,288
I told him to stay out
of Robert's rebellion.

283
00:17:39,323 --> 00:17:42,825
He had no business
fighting an actual warrior.

284
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:46,294
We mothers
do what we can

285
00:17:46,328 --> 00:17:48,496
to keep our sons
from the grave.

286
00:17:48,530 --> 00:17:50,531
But they do seem
to yearn for it.

287
00:17:50,565 --> 00:17:53,299
We shower them
with good sense,

288
00:17:53,334 --> 00:17:56,836
and it slides right off
like rain off a wing.

289
00:17:57,938 --> 00:17:59,839
And yet the world
belongs to them.

290
00:17:59,873 --> 00:18:02,775
A ridiculous arrangement,
to my mind.

291
00:18:06,478 --> 00:18:08,679
The gods have seen fit
to make it so.

292
00:18:10,547 --> 00:18:12,381
My father didn't
want them here.

293
00:18:12,415 --> 00:18:14,049
He was going to have
their bodies burned

294
00:18:14,084 --> 00:18:15,750
and thrown
in the Blackwater,

295
00:18:15,785 --> 00:18:19,286
but the High Septon
convinced him otherwise.

296
00:18:19,321 --> 00:18:20,955
I'm glad he did.

297
00:18:22,891 --> 00:18:24,357
I'm sorry, Your Grace.

298
00:18:24,392 --> 00:18:26,125
I know they did
terrible things at the end,

299
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:30,062
but their ancestors
built this.

300
00:18:31,998 --> 00:18:33,898
Sometimes severity

301
00:18:33,932 --> 00:18:36,066
is the price we pay
for greatness.

302
00:18:37,269 --> 00:18:40,404
I couldn't agree more.

303
00:18:50,014 --> 00:18:52,448
Shall we go and see them?

304
00:18:52,482 --> 00:18:54,917
If you give them
your love,

305
00:18:54,952 --> 00:18:58,387
they will return it
a thousandfold.

306
00:18:58,421 --> 00:19:00,923
I've spoken with them.

307
00:19:00,957 --> 00:19:03,291
I know how they feel
about you.

308
00:19:03,325 --> 00:19:06,761
You led the defense
of King's Landing.

309
00:19:08,263 --> 00:19:10,498
They adore you.

310
00:19:18,506 --> 00:19:21,041
Open the doors.

311
00:19:28,748 --> 00:19:30,382
Joffrey.

312
00:19:31,551 --> 00:19:33,218
Wait.

313
00:19:34,487 --> 00:19:36,154
- Lady Margaery!
- Lady Margaery!

314
00:19:36,188 --> 00:19:38,956
Bless you,
Lady Margaery!

315
00:19:38,990 --> 00:19:41,425
- Lady Margaery!
- Lady Margaery!

316
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:44,495
- <i>Margaery!</i>
- <i>Long live Lady Margaery!</i>

317
00:19:44,529 --> 00:19:47,030
<i>King Joffrey!</i>

318
00:19:49,133 --> 00:19:52,301
<i>King Joffrey!</i>
<i>King Joffrey!</i>

319
00:19:52,335 --> 00:19:54,436
<i>King Joffrey!</i>

320
00:19:54,470 --> 00:19:56,738
<i>Gods bless King Joffrey!</i>

321
00:20:02,576 --> 00:20:04,477
How far is it
to Deepwood Motte?

322
00:20:04,511 --> 00:20:06,078
Not far, my lord.

323
00:20:06,112 --> 00:20:08,080
Your sister is waiting
for you there.

324
00:20:08,114 --> 00:20:09,915
- She sent you to save me?
- Yes.

325
00:20:09,949 --> 00:20:13,785
I served them, the men
who were torturing you.

326
00:20:13,819 --> 00:20:16,388
I did what they told me and
waited for the right moment.

327
00:20:16,422 --> 00:20:18,790
Why would you risk
your life for me?

328
00:20:18,825 --> 00:20:21,826
I grew up
on Saltcliffe, my lord.

329
00:20:21,861 --> 00:20:24,995
I was only a boy
when they took you away.

330
00:20:25,030 --> 00:20:26,997
My father brought me and my
brothers up to the bluffs

331
00:20:27,031 --> 00:20:30,033
so we could watch the ship
that carried you off.

332
00:20:30,067 --> 00:20:33,102
I remember the look on my
father's face when he told us,

333
00:20:33,136 --> 00:20:35,938
"That's Balon Greyjoy's
last living son."

334
00:20:37,340 --> 00:20:39,674
And those are the words
I heard over and over again

335
00:20:39,708 --> 00:20:42,009
when I saw what
they were doing to you.

336
00:20:42,043 --> 00:20:44,044
Those men,

337
00:20:44,078 --> 00:20:47,080
they said my father knew
what they were doing to me.

338
00:20:48,815 --> 00:20:50,983
Did he?

339
00:20:51,017 --> 00:20:53,953
I-- I don't know,
my lord.

340
00:20:53,987 --> 00:20:57,456
They-- they never
told me much.

341
00:21:06,498 --> 00:21:08,065
My sister's men
are loyal to her.

342
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:10,267
<i>We don't need</i>
<i>to hide from them.</i>

343
00:21:10,302 --> 00:21:12,336
Not all those
are your sister's men.

344
00:21:12,370 --> 00:21:15,071
Some of them are loyal
to your father.

345
00:21:18,408 --> 00:21:20,408
What is it?

346
00:21:20,443 --> 00:21:22,043
I was just thinking
how jealous I was

347
00:21:22,077 --> 00:21:24,212
when my father told Yara
to take this place.

348
00:21:24,246 --> 00:21:26,013
What did he tell
you to do?

349
00:21:26,048 --> 00:21:28,248
Raid fishing villages.

350
00:21:28,283 --> 00:21:30,117
He didn't trust me.

351
00:21:30,151 --> 00:21:31,918
Thought I was a Stark.

352
00:21:31,953 --> 00:21:34,888
Ha. I could never
be a Stark.

353
00:21:34,922 --> 00:21:37,390
Robb Stark always
reminded me of that.

354
00:21:37,424 --> 00:21:39,926
- He lorded it over you?
- Didn't have to.

355
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:43,128
All he had to do was be.

356
00:21:44,231 --> 00:21:47,166
Be who he was born to be.

357
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:49,668
His life fit him
better than his clothes.

358
00:21:49,703 --> 00:21:52,204
How could someone like that
ever be a brother to me?

359
00:21:52,239 --> 00:21:54,506
<i>He's the King</i>
<i>in the North.</i>

360
00:21:54,540 --> 00:21:55,840
<i>And me...</i>

361
00:21:55,875 --> 00:21:58,542
my father gave me
a choice

362
00:21:58,577 --> 00:22:00,477
and I made it.

363
00:22:01,946 --> 00:22:03,814
I could never
be a Stark.

364
00:22:03,848 --> 00:22:07,317
But ironborn,

365
00:22:07,352 --> 00:22:09,987
that's what
I was born to be.

366
00:22:14,826 --> 00:22:17,427
I paid the iron price
for Winterfell.

367
00:22:24,401 --> 00:22:26,035
I murdered those boys.

368
00:22:29,172 --> 00:22:30,939
The Stark boys?

369
00:22:32,442 --> 00:22:34,042
Never found them.

370
00:22:34,077 --> 00:22:37,712
Just some poor orphans
living with a farmer.

371
00:22:40,515 --> 00:22:43,916
I let Dagmer
slit their throats

372
00:22:43,951 --> 00:22:46,119
and I let him
burn the bodies...

373
00:22:47,755 --> 00:22:50,556
so I could keep
Winterfell...

374
00:22:52,726 --> 00:22:55,094
and make my father proud.

375
00:22:56,062 --> 00:22:58,597
Maybe it's not too late.

376
00:23:01,667 --> 00:23:03,768
It is.

377
00:23:11,275 --> 00:23:14,810
My real father lost his head
at King's Landing.

378
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:18,881
I made a choice...

379
00:23:21,117 --> 00:23:23,451
and I chose wrong.

380
00:23:25,954 --> 00:23:28,622
And now I've burned
everything down.

381
00:23:30,258 --> 00:23:32,659
Not everything,
my lord.

382
00:23:35,495 --> 00:23:36,795
She's up here.

383
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:51,707
- Yara.
- <i>Shh.</i>

384
00:23:51,742 --> 00:23:53,276
Wait.

385
00:24:01,951 --> 00:24:04,386
I brought him back.
He killed the others.

386
00:24:04,420 --> 00:24:06,254
What?
No, I didn't.

387
00:24:06,288 --> 00:24:08,456
You can't!

388
00:24:08,490 --> 00:24:11,192
No, please stop!

389
00:24:13,895 --> 00:24:16,529
No!

390
00:24:16,563 --> 00:24:18,330
Put him back
where he belongs.

391
00:24:42,886 --> 00:24:44,286
Eat.

392
00:24:48,224 --> 00:24:49,824
What are you doing?

393
00:24:50,693 --> 00:24:52,460
I'm dying.

394
00:24:52,494 --> 00:24:55,462
You can't die.

395
00:24:55,497 --> 00:24:57,798
You need to live

396
00:24:57,832 --> 00:25:00,300
to take revenge.

397
00:25:00,334 --> 00:25:02,801
I don't care
about revenge.

398
00:25:02,836 --> 00:25:04,803
You coward.

399
00:25:06,138 --> 00:25:08,739
A little misfortune
and you're giving up.

400
00:25:10,308 --> 00:25:12,342
Misfor--

401
00:25:12,377 --> 00:25:13,944
misfortune?

402
00:25:13,978 --> 00:25:15,745
You lost your hand.

403
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:18,514
My sword hand.
I was that hand.

404
00:25:20,584 --> 00:25:23,085
You have a taste--

405
00:25:23,119 --> 00:25:25,820
one taste
of the real world

406
00:25:25,855 --> 00:25:28,957
where people have important
things taken from them

407
00:25:28,991 --> 00:25:31,759
and you whine
and cry and quit.

408
00:25:31,793 --> 00:25:34,261
You sound like
a bloody woman.

409
00:25:59,951 --> 00:26:02,285
I know what
you did for me.

410
00:26:03,554 --> 00:26:06,556
You told them Tarth
was full of sapphires.

411
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:12,527
It's called
the Sapphire Isle

412
00:26:12,562 --> 00:26:14,730
because of the blue
of its water.

413
00:26:17,666 --> 00:26:19,833
You knew that.

414
00:26:26,974 --> 00:26:29,308
Why did you help me?

415
00:26:55,363 --> 00:26:57,097
You wanted to speak to me?

416
00:26:57,131 --> 00:26:59,499
Yes, about Jaime.

417
00:27:00,568 --> 00:27:02,168
What about him?

418
00:27:02,202 --> 00:27:03,602
I wanted to make sure

419
00:27:03,637 --> 00:27:06,071
we're doing everything
we can to get him back.

420
00:27:09,408 --> 00:27:12,276
When Catelyn Stark
took Tyrion prisoner...

421
00:27:13,879 --> 00:27:15,613
what did I do
in response?

422
00:27:15,647 --> 00:27:18,682
- You started a war.
- And if I would start a war

423
00:27:18,716 --> 00:27:21,084
for that lecherous
little stump,

424
00:27:21,118 --> 00:27:24,287
what do you think I am doing
for my oldest son and heir?

425
00:27:24,321 --> 00:27:26,989
Whatever you can.

426
00:27:27,024 --> 00:27:29,792
Whatever I can.

427
00:27:41,637 --> 00:27:43,905
- You're still here.
- Yes.

428
00:27:46,641 --> 00:27:49,076
Why?

429
00:27:49,110 --> 00:27:50,510
Did it ever occur to you

430
00:27:50,544 --> 00:27:52,545
that I might be the one
who deserves your confidence

431
00:27:52,579 --> 00:27:55,047
and your trust,
not your sons?

432
00:27:55,081 --> 00:27:57,950
Not Jaime or Tyrion,
but me.

433
00:27:57,984 --> 00:28:00,185
Years and years
of lectures on family

434
00:28:00,219 --> 00:28:02,287
and legacy--

435
00:28:02,321 --> 00:28:03,821
the same lecture,
really,

436
00:28:03,856 --> 00:28:07,158
just with tiny,
tedious variations--

437
00:28:07,192 --> 00:28:08,926
did it ever occur to you
that your daughter

438
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:10,690
might be the only one
listening to them?

439
00:28:10,715 --> 00:28:12,243
Living by them?

440
00:28:12,663 --> 00:28:16,232
That she might have the most
to contribute to your legacy

441
00:28:16,266 --> 00:28:19,168
that you love so much more
than your actual children?

442
00:28:26,209 --> 00:28:29,310
All right.
Contribute.

443
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:34,081
The Tyrells are a problem.

444
00:28:35,417 --> 00:28:38,685
The Tyrells helped us
defeat Stannis Baratheon.

445
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:41,988
The Tyrells saved your life,
your children's lives.

446
00:28:43,390 --> 00:28:45,724
Margaery has her claws
in Joffrey.

447
00:28:47,527 --> 00:28:49,727
She knows how
to manipulate him.

448
00:28:49,762 --> 00:28:51,129
Good.

449
00:28:51,163 --> 00:28:53,264
I wish you knew
how to manipulate him.

450
00:28:54,666 --> 00:28:57,234
I don't distrust you
because you're a woman.

451
00:28:57,269 --> 00:29:00,771
I distrust you because you're not
as smart as you think you are.

452
00:29:00,805 --> 00:29:03,574
You've allowed that boy
to ride roughshod over you

453
00:29:03,608 --> 00:29:06,577
and everyone else
in this city.

454
00:29:11,583 --> 00:29:13,951
Perhaps...

455
00:29:13,985 --> 00:29:17,454
you should try stopping him
from doing what he likes.

456
00:29:21,793 --> 00:29:23,927
I will.

457
00:29:25,262 --> 00:29:27,163
<i>Do you like it, Nana?</i>

458
00:29:27,197 --> 00:29:30,065
Another golden rose.
How original.

459
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:32,501
I eat from plates
stamped with roses.

460
00:29:32,535 --> 00:29:34,736
I sleep in sheets
embroidered with roses.

461
00:29:34,771 --> 00:29:37,639
I have a golden rose
painted on my chamber pot,

462
00:29:37,673 --> 00:29:40,074
as if that makes it
smell any better.

463
00:29:40,109 --> 00:29:41,776
Roses are boring, dear.

464
00:29:41,810 --> 00:29:44,345
"Growing strong."

465
00:29:44,379 --> 00:29:47,480
Ha! The dullest words
of any house.

466
00:29:47,515 --> 00:29:49,415
"Winter is coming!"

467
00:29:49,449 --> 00:29:51,484
Now that's memorable.

468
00:29:51,518 --> 00:29:54,586
"We do not sow."
Strong. Strong.

469
00:29:54,621 --> 00:29:56,655
Those are houses
you watch out for.

470
00:29:56,689 --> 00:30:00,825
Direwolves and krakens,
fierce beasts.

471
00:30:00,859 --> 00:30:02,860
But a golden rose
growing strong--

472
00:30:02,894 --> 00:30:06,263
ha, that strikes fear
in the heart.

473
00:30:07,498 --> 00:30:10,733
Look, little loves.

474
00:30:10,768 --> 00:30:12,668
A spider in the garden.

475
00:30:13,804 --> 00:30:15,504
Run along now.

476
00:30:15,539 --> 00:30:17,473
Grow strong.

477
00:30:19,509 --> 00:30:21,042
My lady.

478
00:30:21,077 --> 00:30:24,412
I wanted to personally
welcome you to King's Landing.

479
00:30:24,446 --> 00:30:26,914
The city has been made
brighter by your presence.

480
00:30:26,949 --> 00:30:30,017
The city is made brighter
by my presence?

481
00:30:30,051 --> 00:30:32,419
Is that your usual line,
Lord Varys?

482
00:30:32,453 --> 00:30:34,020
Are you here
to seduce me?

483
00:30:34,055 --> 00:30:35,722
A little obvious,
perhaps.

484
00:30:35,757 --> 00:30:37,657
Oh, no, please.

485
00:30:37,691 --> 00:30:41,060
Seduce away.
It's been so long.

486
00:30:41,095 --> 00:30:43,462
Though I rather think
it's all for naught.

487
00:30:43,496 --> 00:30:47,132
What happens when the nonexistent
bumps against the decrepit?

488
00:30:48,334 --> 00:30:50,435
A question for
the philosophers.

489
00:30:50,469 --> 00:30:53,504
But you've come mincing
all this way for something.

490
00:30:53,538 --> 00:30:55,672
- So?
- Might I sit?

491
00:30:55,706 --> 00:30:57,607
No.

492
00:30:57,641 --> 00:31:00,809
Come, I've heard
you're such a clever man.

493
00:31:00,844 --> 00:31:03,545
I'm curious why
you've sought me out.

494
00:31:04,747 --> 00:31:07,315
You've taken an interest
in Sansa Stark.

495
00:31:07,349 --> 00:31:08,482
Have I?

496
00:31:08,517 --> 00:31:10,384
Because I spoke to her
once in this garden

497
00:31:10,418 --> 00:31:13,320
and one of your little spies
came running to tell you?

498
00:31:13,355 --> 00:31:14,655
Why shouldn't I take
an interest?

499
00:31:14,689 --> 00:31:16,456
- She's an interesting girl.
- Is she?

500
00:31:16,491 --> 00:31:18,291
No, not particularly.

501
00:31:18,325 --> 00:31:20,360
But she's had
an interesting childhood.

502
00:31:20,394 --> 00:31:23,162
She has, sadly.

503
00:31:23,196 --> 00:31:25,497
Well, forgive me for wasting
your time, then.

504
00:31:25,531 --> 00:31:28,866
I thought we shared certain
hopes for her well-being.

505
00:31:28,901 --> 00:31:30,367
Come, come.

506
00:31:30,401 --> 00:31:32,969
You surrender
rather easily.

507
00:31:34,472 --> 00:31:35,839
Walk with me.

508
00:31:35,873 --> 00:31:37,607
I know the walls
have ears,

509
00:31:37,641 --> 00:31:39,976
but apparently
the shrubbery does, too.

510
00:31:40,010 --> 00:31:42,812
I choose my allies
carefully

511
00:31:42,846 --> 00:31:45,814
and my enemies
more carefully still.

512
00:31:45,848 --> 00:31:47,749
Which is Sansa Stark?

513
00:31:47,783 --> 00:31:50,585
Neither.
A babe in the woods.

514
00:31:50,619 --> 00:31:52,820
- I admired her father.
- Yes.

515
00:31:52,855 --> 00:31:54,955
Ned Stark
had many admirers,

516
00:31:54,990 --> 00:31:56,423
and how many
stepped forward

517
00:31:56,457 --> 00:31:59,025
when the executioner
came for his head?

518
00:31:59,060 --> 00:32:00,626
I could not help
Lord Stark.

519
00:32:00,661 --> 00:32:03,896
- Perhaps I can help his daughter.
- How?

520
00:32:03,930 --> 00:32:07,399
You're not the only one who has
taken an interest in her.

521
00:32:07,433 --> 00:32:09,200
That's hardly surprising.

522
00:32:09,235 --> 00:32:11,569
She's a beautiful girl
with a famous name.

523
00:32:11,603 --> 00:32:15,139
Indeed. She'd make a lovely
match for the right suitor.

524
00:32:15,174 --> 00:32:18,041
It almost feels as if you're
about to arrive at the point.

525
00:32:18,076 --> 00:32:20,710
Littlefinger is not long
for the capital.

526
00:32:20,744 --> 00:32:22,745
A confidant of mine
has told me

527
00:32:22,779 --> 00:32:25,680
that when he goes,
Sansa Stark goes with him.

528
00:32:25,715 --> 00:32:28,016
And why have you come
to me with this matter?

529
00:32:28,050 --> 00:32:31,853
Littlefinger was born with no
lands, no wealth, no armies.

530
00:32:31,887 --> 00:32:33,621
He has acquired
the first two.

531
00:32:33,655 --> 00:32:35,389
How long before
he has the army?

532
00:32:35,424 --> 00:32:37,524
Perhaps you'll laugh,

533
00:32:37,559 --> 00:32:39,592
but I know him
better than most

534
00:32:39,627 --> 00:32:41,828
and this is the truth.

535
00:32:41,862 --> 00:32:46,466
Littlefinger is one of the most
dangerous men in Westeros.

536
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:48,868
If Robb Stark falls,

537
00:32:48,902 --> 00:32:51,303
Sansa Stark is the key
to the North.

538
00:32:51,337 --> 00:32:54,305
And if Littlefinger marries her,
he'll have the key in his pocket.

539
00:32:54,339 --> 00:32:56,107
Which seems such a shame.

540
00:32:56,141 --> 00:32:58,242
Why should a man
with such a low reputation

541
00:32:58,276 --> 00:33:00,244
steal away
such a lovely bride?

542
00:33:00,278 --> 00:33:02,345
You must despise him.

543
00:33:02,380 --> 00:33:04,513
You're working so hard
to undermine him.

544
00:33:04,548 --> 00:33:07,482
Actually,
I rather enjoy him.

545
00:33:07,517 --> 00:33:09,617
But he would see
this country burn

546
00:33:09,652 --> 00:33:12,052
if he could be
king of the ashes.

547
00:33:12,087 --> 00:33:14,121
You are a clever man,
Lord Varys.

548
00:33:14,156 --> 00:33:15,689
You are too kind.

549
00:33:15,723 --> 00:33:18,658
I believe I have
a possible solution.

550
00:33:18,692 --> 00:33:20,460
One doesn't need
to be clever for that.

551
00:33:20,494 --> 00:33:22,061
It's all rather obvious,
isn't it?

552
00:33:33,505 --> 00:33:35,238
Ahem.

553
00:33:35,273 --> 00:33:37,306
I didn't mean
to disturb you.

554
00:33:37,341 --> 00:33:39,074
You haven't.

555
00:33:39,109 --> 00:33:40,876
We'd like
some privacy, please.

556
00:33:40,910 --> 00:33:43,111
If you wouldn't mind
waiting back inside the keep.

557
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:47,548
Or if you'd be kind enough
to give me your names,

558
00:33:47,582 --> 00:33:50,484
I'll ask the king
to speak with you himself.

559
00:33:54,488 --> 00:33:56,189
What did you pray for?

560
00:33:56,223 --> 00:33:58,858
- I can't tell you.
- Why not?

561
00:33:58,892 --> 00:34:01,593
I'll tell you what I prayed for
in the sept this morning.

562
00:34:01,628 --> 00:34:05,430
Let's see, for my family's
health and happiness,

563
00:34:05,464 --> 00:34:08,699
for an end to the war,
for a short winter.

564
00:34:08,734 --> 00:34:11,368
Boring and traditional,
I'm afraid.

565
00:34:11,402 --> 00:34:15,204
- And you?
- I'm sorry, I just can't.

566
00:34:15,238 --> 00:34:16,806
My cousin Alanna

567
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:19,375
was the most beautiful
girl I'd ever seen.

568
00:34:19,409 --> 00:34:21,543
When I was 12, I was
all elbows and knees

569
00:34:21,578 --> 00:34:24,045
and Alanna looked like a
goddess sent to torture me.

570
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:25,880
Pig-face, she called me.

571
00:34:25,915 --> 00:34:27,782
Pig-face?
That's ridiculous.

572
00:34:27,816 --> 00:34:30,051
I think it had something
to do with my nose.

573
00:34:30,085 --> 00:34:32,486
Whenever she passed me
in the halls, she'd oink.

574
00:34:35,557 --> 00:34:38,358
So I prayed that she'd catch
a horrible skin disease.

575
00:34:38,393 --> 00:34:40,827
A week after that, she came
down with porridge plague.

576
00:34:40,861 --> 00:34:43,462
- Porridge plague?
- You don't have it in the North?

577
00:34:43,497 --> 00:34:45,898
Your skin starts
to look like boiled oats

578
00:34:45,932 --> 00:34:48,733
and eventually your face
slides off and you diein agony.

579
00:34:48,767 --> 00:34:50,668
But that's awful.

580
00:34:52,871 --> 00:34:55,406
You're--

581
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:57,408
I believed you!

582
00:34:57,442 --> 00:34:59,343
Porridge plague.
I'm an idiot.

583
00:34:59,377 --> 00:35:01,578
Don't say that.
No, you're not.

584
00:35:01,613 --> 00:35:04,213
So what happened
to Alanna?

585
00:35:04,247 --> 00:35:06,348
Oh, she grew up to be
the most beautiful woman

586
00:35:06,382 --> 00:35:09,317
and married a handsome lord
and they have darling children

587
00:35:09,352 --> 00:35:11,152
and live in a castle
by the sea.

588
00:35:11,186 --> 00:35:13,788
It's all terribly
frustrating.

589
00:35:13,822 --> 00:35:16,524
I'm sure she's jealous
of you now.

590
00:35:16,558 --> 00:35:18,825
You'll be married
here in the capital

591
00:35:18,860 --> 00:35:22,528
and she'll have to come watch and
pretend to be happy that you're queen.

592
00:35:25,332 --> 00:35:29,101
I want us to be friends,
good friends.

593
00:35:29,136 --> 00:35:31,336
That would make me
very happy.

594
00:35:32,971 --> 00:35:34,805
You must see Highgarden.

595
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:36,874
You'd love it there.
I know you would.

596
00:35:36,908 --> 00:35:39,809
We have a great masquerade the
night of the harvest moon.

597
00:35:39,844 --> 00:35:41,277
You should see
the costumes.

598
00:35:41,312 --> 00:35:43,013
People work on them
for months.

599
00:35:44,181 --> 00:35:46,482
I-- I don't think
the queen

600
00:35:46,516 --> 00:35:48,017
would let me leave
King's Landing.

601
00:35:48,051 --> 00:35:49,851
The Queen Regent,
you mean.

602
00:35:49,886 --> 00:35:52,253
Once I marry Joffrey,
I'll be queen.

603
00:35:54,056 --> 00:35:58,359
And if you were
to marry Loras...

604
00:36:00,762 --> 00:36:04,564
Oh, your place would
be at Highgarden, wouldn't it?

605
00:36:05,599 --> 00:36:07,967
We would be sisters,
you and I.

606
00:36:08,002 --> 00:36:09,935
Would you like that?

607
00:36:23,782 --> 00:36:26,416
His name was Bannen.

608
00:36:26,450 --> 00:36:28,151
He was a good man,

609
00:36:28,185 --> 00:36:30,120
a good ranger.

610
00:36:30,154 --> 00:36:32,288
He came to us from--

611
00:36:33,857 --> 00:36:35,925
where did he come from?

612
00:36:35,959 --> 00:36:38,694
Down White Harbor way.

613
00:36:38,728 --> 00:36:40,862
He came to us
from White Harbor.

614
00:36:40,897 --> 00:36:43,931
Never failed
in his duty.

615
00:36:43,965 --> 00:36:47,067
He kept his vows
the best he could.

616
00:36:47,101 --> 00:36:51,004
He rode far,
fought fiercely.

617
00:36:53,107 --> 00:36:55,541
We shall never see
his like again.

618
00:36:55,576 --> 00:36:59,011
And now his watch
has ended.

619
00:37:00,279 --> 00:37:02,814
And now his watch
has ended.

620
00:37:07,152 --> 00:37:10,420
Didn't think a broke foot
could kill a man.

621
00:37:10,454 --> 00:37:13,322
It wasn't his foot
that killed him.

622
00:37:13,357 --> 00:37:16,025
That bastard Craster
starved him to death.

623
00:37:16,059 --> 00:37:17,860
Craster's got
his daughters to feed.

624
00:37:17,894 --> 00:37:19,294
<i>You on his side?</i>

625
00:37:19,328 --> 00:37:22,397
We can't just show up
and steal all his food.

626
00:37:22,431 --> 00:37:25,066
We're brothers
of the Night's Watch, not thieves.

627
00:37:25,100 --> 00:37:26,901
The day we leave,

628
00:37:26,968 --> 00:37:30,537
Craster will tap
a barrel of our wine

629
00:37:30,572 --> 00:37:33,708
<i>and sit down to a feast</i>
<i>of ham and potatoes</i>

630
00:37:33,742 --> 00:37:35,710
<i>and laugh at us</i>

631
00:37:35,744 --> 00:37:37,979
starving in the snow.

632
00:37:40,748 --> 00:37:42,683
He's a bloody wildling
is all he is.

633
00:37:45,420 --> 00:37:48,721
Never knew Bannen
could smell so good.

634
00:37:59,298 --> 00:38:02,867
You have one son,
don't you, Mormont?

635
00:38:04,436 --> 00:38:06,636
I had my 99th.

636
00:38:07,839 --> 00:38:10,807
You ever meet a man
with 99 sons?

637
00:38:12,576 --> 00:38:16,078
And more daughters
than I can count.

638
00:38:16,113 --> 00:38:18,513
- I'm glad for you.
- Are you now?

639
00:38:18,548 --> 00:38:22,217
Me, I'll be glad when you
and yours have gone.

640
00:38:22,251 --> 00:38:24,319
As soon as our wounded
are strong enough.

641
00:38:24,353 --> 00:38:26,287
Ah.

642
00:38:26,321 --> 00:38:28,422
They're as strong
as they're gonna get.

643
00:38:30,324 --> 00:38:31,725
Them that's dying,

644
00:38:31,759 --> 00:38:33,860
why don't you cut their throats
and be done with it?

645
00:38:33,894 --> 00:38:35,862
<i>Hmm?</i>

646
00:38:35,896 --> 00:38:39,097
<i>Or leave them</i>
<i>if you've not the stomach</i>

647
00:38:39,132 --> 00:38:40,665
and I'll sort them myself.

648
00:38:42,001 --> 00:38:44,869
<i>Whose throat you</i>
<i>gonna cut, old man?</i>

649
00:38:48,306 --> 00:38:49,640
Wait outside.

650
00:38:49,674 --> 00:38:53,076
It's cold outside
and there's nothing to eat.

651
00:38:53,111 --> 00:38:54,611
My wives gave you bread.

652
00:38:54,645 --> 00:38:57,881
There's sawdust
in the bread.

653
00:38:57,915 --> 00:38:59,449
You don't like it,

654
00:38:59,483 --> 00:39:01,851
you go out there
and eat the snow.

655
00:39:06,756 --> 00:39:10,591
I'd rather eat what
you've got hidden away.

656
00:39:12,694 --> 00:39:15,661
I told you
to wait outside.

657
00:39:15,696 --> 00:39:17,529
He's sitting there
drinking our wine,

658
00:39:17,564 --> 00:39:19,264
eating his fill
while we die.

659
00:39:20,433 --> 00:39:22,934
I gave you crows enough.

660
00:39:22,968 --> 00:39:24,235
I've got to feed
my women!

661
00:39:24,269 --> 00:39:26,169
So you admit you've got
a hidden larder, then?

662
00:39:26,204 --> 00:39:27,684
How else'd you make it
through winter?

663
00:39:27,705 --> 00:39:30,708
Enough!
Out!

664
00:39:30,742 --> 00:39:32,610
I am a godly man.

665
00:39:32,644 --> 00:39:34,144
You're a stingy bastard!

666
00:39:34,178 --> 00:39:35,545
Bastard?

667
00:39:35,580 --> 00:39:39,082
Out with you,
you little thief.

668
00:39:39,116 --> 00:39:42,485
And you!
And you!

669
00:39:44,221 --> 00:39:46,755
Go sleep in the cold
on empty bellies.

670
00:39:49,125 --> 00:39:50,892
I'll chop the hands
off the next man

671
00:39:50,927 --> 00:39:53,261
who calls me bastard.

672
00:40:08,341 --> 00:40:09,975
You are a bastard.

673
00:40:12,644 --> 00:40:16,146
A daughter-fucking,
wildling bastard.

674
00:40:24,021 --> 00:40:25,955
The gods will
curse us for this.

675
00:40:25,990 --> 00:40:27,311
By all the laws--

676
00:40:27,336 --> 00:40:29,211
There are no laws
beyond the Wall.

677
00:40:29,359 --> 00:40:30,892
Now show us where
he hides the food

678
00:40:30,927 --> 00:40:33,027
or you'll get
the same as he did.

679
00:40:33,062 --> 00:40:35,463
Unhand her.

680
00:40:35,497 --> 00:40:37,364
I shall have your head for this.

681
00:41:28,810 --> 00:41:31,178
- Quickly. Quickly.
- What's happening?

682
00:41:31,212 --> 00:41:34,780
- I'm not going out there.
- No, we have to go. Now!

683
00:41:40,052 --> 00:41:42,486
Follow me.
I know the best way.

684
00:41:44,322 --> 00:41:46,223
Come on.

685
00:41:51,862 --> 00:41:53,796
Run fast, Piggy,

686
00:41:53,830 --> 00:41:56,131
and sleep well!

687
00:41:56,166 --> 00:41:59,101
I'll be cutting your throat
one of these nights.

688
00:42:04,406 --> 00:42:05,939
Can I take
this hood off yet?

689
00:42:05,974 --> 00:42:07,707
I do apologize,
little lady,

690
00:42:07,742 --> 00:42:10,443
but it's better for you if you
don't see where we're going.

691
00:42:12,546 --> 00:42:14,613
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

692
00:42:15,815 --> 00:42:17,949
Halt!

693
00:42:23,387 --> 00:42:25,855
- What is it?
- Blackstrap rum.

694
00:42:26,724 --> 00:42:28,391
Ugh!

695
00:42:28,425 --> 00:42:30,693
Not easy finding
molasses in wartime.

696
00:42:30,727 --> 00:42:32,594
I'd have some.

697
00:42:36,165 --> 00:42:37,598
Let's go home.

698
00:42:54,613 --> 00:42:56,380
<i>What is this place?</i>

699
00:42:56,414 --> 00:42:59,516
Somewhere neither wolves
nor lions come prowling.

700
00:43:08,491 --> 00:43:11,293
You look like
a bunch of swineherds.

701
00:43:11,327 --> 00:43:13,362
<i>Some of us</i>
<i>were swineherds.</i>

702
00:43:13,396 --> 00:43:16,064
And some of us tanners
and masons.

703
00:43:16,098 --> 00:43:17,465
That was before.

704
00:43:17,500 --> 00:43:19,434
You're still swineherds

705
00:43:19,468 --> 00:43:22,370
and tanners
and masons.

706
00:43:22,405 --> 00:43:25,406
You think carrying a crooked
spear makes you a soldier?

707
00:43:25,441 --> 00:43:28,642
No.

708
00:43:28,676 --> 00:43:31,978
Fighting in a war
makes you a soldier.

709
00:43:32,012 --> 00:43:34,046
Beric Dondarrion?

710
00:43:34,081 --> 00:43:35,781
<i>You've seen better days.</i>

711
00:43:35,815 --> 00:43:38,350
And I won't see them again.

712
00:43:39,752 --> 00:43:41,753
Stark deserters.

713
00:43:41,787 --> 00:43:44,388
Baratheon deserters.

714
00:43:44,423 --> 00:43:45,990
You lot aren't
fighting in a war.

715
00:43:46,024 --> 00:43:47,524
You're running from it.

716
00:43:47,559 --> 00:43:49,860
Last I heard, you were
King Joffrey's guard dog.

717
00:43:49,894 --> 00:43:53,763
But here you are
1,000 miles from home.

718
00:43:53,797 --> 00:43:55,498
Which of us is running?

719
00:43:55,533 --> 00:43:57,600
Untie these ropes
and we'll find out.

720
00:43:57,635 --> 00:44:01,337
What are you doing
leading a mob of peasants?

721
00:44:01,371 --> 00:44:04,172
Ned Stark ordered me
to execute your brother

722
00:44:04,206 --> 00:44:05,506
<i>in King Robert's name.</i>

723
00:44:05,541 --> 00:44:08,009
Ned Stark is dead.

724
00:44:08,043 --> 00:44:10,277
King Robert is dead.

725
00:44:10,312 --> 00:44:12,513
My brother's alive.

726
00:44:14,849 --> 00:44:16,716
You're fighting
for ghosts.

727
00:44:16,751 --> 00:44:18,618
That's what we are--

728
00:44:18,652 --> 00:44:22,489
ghosts waiting for you
in the dark.

729
00:44:22,523 --> 00:44:24,890
You can't see us,

730
00:44:24,925 --> 00:44:26,859
but we see you.

731
00:44:26,893 --> 00:44:29,161
No matter whose cloak
you wear--

732
00:44:29,195 --> 00:44:31,830
Lannister, Stark,
Baratheon--

733
00:44:31,864 --> 00:44:33,865
you prey on the weak,

734
00:44:33,900 --> 00:44:36,735
the Brotherhood without
Banners will hunt you down.

735
00:44:36,769 --> 00:44:38,803
You found god?
Is that it?

736
00:44:38,838 --> 00:44:41,472
Aye.
I've been reborn

737
00:44:41,506 --> 00:44:43,473
in the light
of the one true god.

738
00:44:44,309 --> 00:44:46,009
<i>As have we all.</i>

739
00:44:46,043 --> 00:44:48,544
<i>As would any man who's seen</i>
<i>the things we've seen.</i>

740
00:44:48,578 --> 00:44:51,280
If you mean to murder me, then
bloody well get on with it.

741
00:44:51,315 --> 00:44:54,483
You'll die
soon enough, dog.

742
00:44:54,517 --> 00:44:58,053
But it won't be murder,
only justice.

743
00:44:58,087 --> 00:45:00,021
<i>And a kinder fate</i>
<i>than you deserve.</i>

744
00:45:00,055 --> 00:45:01,555
<i>Lions you call</i>
<i>yourselves.</i>

745
00:45:01,590 --> 00:45:04,791
At the Mummer's Ford,
girls of seven years were raped

746
00:45:04,826 --> 00:45:07,059
<i>and babes</i>
<i>still on the breast</i>

747
00:45:07,094 --> 00:45:08,761
were cut in two while
their mothers watched.

748
00:45:08,795 --> 00:45:11,063
I wasn't at
the Mummer's Ford.

749
00:45:11,098 --> 00:45:13,598
Dump your dead children
at some other door.

750
00:45:13,632 --> 00:45:16,000
House Clegane was built
upon dead children.

751
00:45:16,034 --> 00:45:18,569
I saw them lay Prince Aegon
and Princess Rhaenys

752
00:45:18,603 --> 00:45:20,137
before the Iron Throne.

753
00:45:20,171 --> 00:45:21,904
Do you take me
for my brother?

754
00:45:21,939 --> 00:45:24,407
Is being born
Clegane a crime?

755
00:45:24,441 --> 00:45:27,476
- Murder is a crime.
- I never touched the Targaryen babes.

756
00:45:27,510 --> 00:45:30,312
I never saw them,
never smelled them,

757
00:45:30,347 --> 00:45:32,214
never heard them bawling.

758
00:45:32,249 --> 00:45:35,918
You want to cut my throat,
get on with it!

759
00:45:35,952 --> 00:45:37,986
But don't call me murderer

760
00:45:38,021 --> 00:45:39,855
and pretend that you're not.

761
00:45:39,889 --> 00:45:41,924
You murdered Mycah.

762
00:45:41,958 --> 00:45:43,458
The butcher's boy.

763
00:45:43,493 --> 00:45:45,427
My friend.

764
00:45:45,461 --> 00:45:48,696
He was 12 years old.
He was unarmed.

765
00:45:48,730 --> 00:45:50,097
<i>And you rode him down.</i>

766
00:45:50,131 --> 00:45:52,833
You slung him over your horse
like he was some deer.

767
00:45:52,867 --> 00:45:55,435
Aye, he was a bleeder.

768
00:45:56,604 --> 00:45:58,170
You don't deny
killing this boy?

769
00:45:58,205 --> 00:45:59,838
I was Joffrey's
sworn shield.

770
00:45:59,873 --> 00:46:01,874
- The boy attacked the prince.
- That's a lie!

771
00:46:01,908 --> 00:46:05,311
I hit Joffrey.
Mycah just ran away.

772
00:46:05,345 --> 00:46:06,979
Then I should have
killed you.

773
00:46:07,013 --> 00:46:10,214
Not my place
to question princes.

774
00:46:11,717 --> 00:46:13,718
You stand accused of murder.

775
00:46:13,752 --> 00:46:16,087
But no one here knows
the truth of the charge,

776
00:46:16,121 --> 00:46:18,456
so it is not for us
to judge you.

777
00:46:18,490 --> 00:46:21,292
Only the Lord of Light
may do that now.

778
00:46:23,294 --> 00:46:25,962
I sentence you
to trial by combat.

779
00:46:28,032 --> 00:46:30,433
So, who will it be?

780
00:46:31,635 --> 00:46:33,369
Should we find out
if your fire god

781
00:46:33,403 --> 00:46:35,704
really loves you, priest?

782
00:46:35,738 --> 00:46:37,238
Or you, archer?

783
00:46:37,263 --> 00:46:39,490
What are you worth
with a sword in your hand?

784
00:46:40,743 --> 00:46:43,310
Or is the little girl
the bravest one here?

785
00:46:45,447 --> 00:46:47,414
Aye.

786
00:46:47,448 --> 00:46:49,516
She might be.

787
00:46:51,619 --> 00:46:53,687
But it's me you'll fight.

788
00:47:17,409 --> 00:47:19,911
The master says
they are untested.

789
00:47:22,180 --> 00:47:26,116
He says you would be wise
to blood them early.

790
00:47:26,150 --> 00:47:28,751
There are many small cities
between here and there,

791
00:47:28,786 --> 00:47:30,887
cities ripe for sacking.

792
00:47:32,823 --> 00:47:34,857
<i>Should you take captives,</i>

793
00:47:34,891 --> 00:47:38,059
the masters will buy the healthy ones
and for a good price.

794
00:47:41,830 --> 00:47:44,131
<i>And who knows?</i>

795
00:47:44,166 --> 00:47:48,268
In 10 years, some of the boys
you send them

796
00:47:48,302 --> 00:47:50,503
may be Unsullied
in their turn.

797
00:47:50,538 --> 00:47:52,672
Thus all shall prosper.

798
00:48:46,217 --> 00:48:49,419
Is it done, then?
They belong to me?

799
00:48:52,356 --> 00:48:56,025
<i>It is done.</i>

800
00:48:56,059 --> 00:48:57,760
You hold the whip.

801
00:50:29,139 --> 00:50:30,840
Dracarys.

802
00:53:35,849 --> 00:53:40,849
