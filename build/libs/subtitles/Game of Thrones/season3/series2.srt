1
00:00:01,272 --> 00:00:03,473
<i>Why do you want</i>
<i>to join us, Jon Snow?</i>

2
00:00:03,508 --> 00:00:05,450
I saw Craster take
his own baby boy and

3
00:00:05,475 --> 00:00:06,775
leave it in the woods.

4
00:00:06,776 --> 00:00:08,443
I saw what took it.

5
00:00:08,478 --> 00:00:11,413
When I told the Lord Commander,
he already knew.

6
00:00:11,447 --> 00:00:14,549
I want to fight for the side
that fights for the living.

7
00:00:14,584 --> 00:00:16,051
How did you kill
those guards?

8
00:00:16,085 --> 00:00:16,951
Show me how.

9
00:00:16,976 --> 00:00:18,821
If you would learn,
you must come with me.

10
00:00:18,822 --> 00:00:22,157
I want to, but I need
to find my brother and mother.

11
00:00:22,192 --> 00:00:23,559
And my sister.

12
00:00:23,593 --> 00:00:26,563
You have to go.
Go to the Wall, to Jon.

13
00:00:26,598 --> 00:00:28,999
Osha, you must
protect them.

14
00:00:29,034 --> 00:00:31,134
You're the only one
who can.

15
00:00:31,169 --> 00:00:35,005
200 Northmen
slaughtered like sheep.

16
00:00:35,039 --> 00:00:36,908
The debt will be
repaid, my friend.

17
00:00:36,942 --> 00:00:38,910
<i>For them</i>
<i>and for your sons.</i>

18
00:00:38,944 --> 00:00:40,646
They rot in the ground

19
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:42,849
<i>while their killer</i>
<i>runs free.</i>

20
00:00:42,883 --> 00:00:44,617
Those were Stark men.

21
00:00:44,651 --> 00:00:47,420
I don't serve the Starks.
I serve Lady Catelyn.

22
00:00:47,455 --> 00:00:49,289
I told you I'd take you
to King's Landing,

23
00:00:49,324 --> 00:00:50,691
and that's what
I'm going to do.

24
00:00:50,725 --> 00:00:52,685
<i>Joffrey tells me</i>
<i>you stopped your carriage</i>

25
00:00:52,693 --> 00:00:54,194
at Flea Bottom
this morning.

26
00:00:54,229 --> 00:00:55,790
<i>I paid a visit</i>
<i>to an orphanage</i>

27
00:00:55,797 --> 00:00:57,364
<i>the High Septon</i>
<i>told me about.</i>

28
00:00:57,399 --> 00:00:59,800
Not long ago we were attacked
by a mob there.

29
00:00:59,835 --> 00:01:01,669
<i>The king barely escaped</i>
<i>with his life.</i>

30
00:01:01,704 --> 00:01:04,405
My mother's always had
a penchant for drama.

31
00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:06,974
Facts become less and less
important to her

32
00:01:07,008 --> 00:01:08,675
<i>as she grows older.</i>

33
00:01:08,710 --> 00:01:10,243
You said you'd
take me home.

34
00:01:10,278 --> 00:01:11,912
If you were to tell
just one...

35
00:01:11,946 --> 00:01:13,614
Please, Lord Baelish,
tell me what to do.

36
00:01:13,648 --> 00:01:15,649
- Tell me when.
<i>- Watch out for her.</i>

37
00:01:15,684 --> 00:01:17,618
Watch out for her
with him.

38
00:01:19,354 --> 00:01:21,355
Ah!

39
00:01:23,558 --> 00:01:25,726
We need to get back
to the Wall.

40
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:29,429
We know what's out there,
but we have to warn them.

41

44
00:04:10,899 --> 00:04:14,602
Don't think
too much, Bran.

45
00:04:14,636 --> 00:04:16,337
Relax your bow arm.

46
00:04:25,546 --> 00:04:27,648
<i>And which one of you</i>
<i>was a marksman at 10?</i>

47
00:04:27,682 --> 00:04:29,750
Father?

48
00:04:37,692 --> 00:04:39,793
You can't kill it,
you know.

49
00:04:39,828 --> 00:04:41,562
Why not?

50
00:04:43,832 --> 00:04:45,966
Because the raven is you.

51
00:04:55,744 --> 00:04:57,211
Hodor.

52
00:04:57,245 --> 00:04:58,913
It's all right, Hodor.

53
00:04:58,947 --> 00:05:01,315
Hodor.

54
00:05:05,988 --> 00:05:08,924
<i>Were you inside the wolf</i>
<i>again, little lord?</i>

55
00:05:08,958 --> 00:05:11,894
No, it was
the three-eyed raven.

56
00:05:11,928 --> 00:05:14,096
<i>He's back.</i>

57
00:05:15,865 --> 00:05:17,232
I tried to kill it,
but I couldn't.

58
00:05:17,267 --> 00:05:20,202
- There was a boy.
- <i>I don't want to hear about it.</i>

59
00:05:20,236 --> 00:05:22,671
- But you asked.
- We've got plenty of worries.

60
00:05:22,705 --> 00:05:25,107
We don't need to pour
black magic on top of them.

61
00:05:25,141 --> 00:05:28,477
I didn't ask
for black magic dreams.

62
00:05:28,511 --> 00:05:30,212
I know you didn't,
little lord.

63
00:05:32,082 --> 00:05:34,016
We need to move.

64
00:05:34,051 --> 00:05:35,651
We don't know
who might be after us.

65
00:05:35,686 --> 00:05:37,420
No one even knows
we're alive.

66
00:05:38,622 --> 00:05:40,289
And who told you that?

67
00:05:40,324 --> 00:05:42,525
<i>The three-eyed raven</i>
<i>tell you?</i>

68
00:05:42,559 --> 00:05:44,594
- No.
- Some good he is, then.

69
00:05:46,997 --> 00:05:50,000
<i>I don't know what other people</i>
<i>know and what they don't.</i>

70
00:05:50,034 --> 00:05:53,070
I only know the Wall
is a long way off.

71
00:06:02,647 --> 00:06:04,348
My mother
always told me

72
00:06:04,382 --> 00:06:06,717
you Westerosi
were a grim lot.

73
00:06:07,886 --> 00:06:11,088
Grim, bearded,

74
00:06:11,123 --> 00:06:12,790
stinking barbarians

75
00:06:12,825 --> 00:06:14,759
that would row
across the Narrow Sea

76
00:06:14,793 --> 00:06:17,995
and steal us
from our beds.

77
00:06:18,030 --> 00:06:20,231
Did you ever think
you'd marry one?

78
00:06:22,067 --> 00:06:24,803
I never thought
I'd marry anyone at all.

79
00:06:24,837 --> 00:06:27,138
Never?

80
00:06:27,173 --> 00:06:30,675
Not until I met
the king of the grim,

81
00:06:30,709 --> 00:06:32,911
bearded,
stinking barbarians.

82
00:06:39,285 --> 00:06:41,687
Pardon me, Your Grace.

83
00:06:41,721 --> 00:06:44,590
- My queen.
- Lord Bolton.

84
00:06:46,994 --> 00:06:48,962
Let me guess which one
is the good news.

85
00:06:51,099 --> 00:06:53,367
Word from Riverrun

86
00:06:53,401 --> 00:06:55,035
and Winterfell.

87
00:07:00,007 --> 00:07:02,442
I hadn't seen
him in years.

88
00:07:04,145 --> 00:07:06,612
I don't even know
how many.

89
00:07:08,182 --> 00:07:09,982
We'll travel
to the funeral together.

90
00:07:11,218 --> 00:07:12,485
<i>Lord Bolton</i>
<i>will garrison here</i>

91
00:07:12,519 --> 00:07:14,921
<i>until we return.</i>

92
00:07:14,955 --> 00:07:18,624
Will I be wearing manacles
when I lay my father to rest?

93
00:07:24,397 --> 00:07:26,532
Something else?

94
00:07:27,834 --> 00:07:30,168
By the time Bolton's
bastard got to Winterfell,

95
00:07:30,203 --> 00:07:32,104
the ironborn were gone.

96
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:37,008
<i>They massacred everyone</i>
<i>and put the castle to the torch.</i>

97
00:07:39,878 --> 00:07:42,380
And Bran and Rickon
have not been found.

98
00:07:46,153 --> 00:07:48,421
They may have escaped.

99
00:07:48,455 --> 00:07:51,758
Or Theon may have taken them
back to the Iron Islands as hostages.

100
00:07:51,792 --> 00:07:54,193
Have you received
any demands?

101
00:07:55,329 --> 00:07:56,563
No.

102
00:07:56,597 --> 00:07:59,198
Have you heard anything
from Theon at all?

103
00:08:20,921 --> 00:08:23,023
Where am I?

104
00:08:28,897 --> 00:08:30,998
Who are you?

105
00:08:36,938 --> 00:08:38,439
What do you want?

106
00:08:38,473 --> 00:08:40,608
I want to do this.

107
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:47,748
Do you know how long
it's going to take us

108
00:08:47,782 --> 00:08:50,484
to get to King's Landing walking
through fields and forests?

109
00:08:50,519 --> 00:08:52,186
Yes.

110
00:08:53,755 --> 00:08:55,089
So how shall
we pass the time?

111
00:08:55,123 --> 00:08:56,991
By putting one foot
in front of the other.

112
00:08:57,025 --> 00:08:59,360
It's going to be
a very dull walk.

113
00:08:59,394 --> 00:09:00,761
I'm here to take you
to King's Landing

114
00:09:00,796 --> 00:09:03,631
and bring back
Lady Stark's daughters in exchange.

115
00:09:03,665 --> 00:09:05,666
Dull is fine.

116
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:08,468
You know, it doesn't matter
how loyal a servant you are,

117
00:09:08,502 --> 00:09:11,371
no one enjoys the company
of a humorless mute.

118
00:09:11,405 --> 00:09:12,839
Trust me on this.

119
00:09:12,873 --> 00:09:15,108
People have been serving me
since I was born.

120
00:09:15,142 --> 00:09:18,512
You think Lady Stark is going
to want a giant towheaded plank

121
00:09:18,546 --> 00:09:21,115
following her around
for the rest of her life?

122
00:09:21,149 --> 00:09:24,519
A week's journey with you and she'll
order you to fall on your sword.

123
00:09:24,553 --> 00:09:28,256
If Lady Stark is unhappy
with any aspect of my service,

124
00:09:28,324 --> 00:09:30,025
I'm sure
she'll let me know.

125
00:09:30,059 --> 00:09:31,559
She's an honest woman.

126
00:09:31,593 --> 00:09:33,561
All the good
it's done her.

127
00:09:39,001 --> 00:09:42,337
How did you come into
Lady Stark's service?

128
00:09:42,371 --> 00:09:43,704
There's something
we can talk about.

129
00:09:43,739 --> 00:09:45,639
Not your concern,
Kingslayer.

130
00:09:45,674 --> 00:09:47,241
It had to be recently.

131
00:09:47,275 --> 00:09:49,243
You weren't with her
at Winterfell.

132
00:09:49,277 --> 00:09:50,677
How would you know?

133
00:09:50,712 --> 00:09:53,514
Because I visited
Winterfell.

134
00:09:53,548 --> 00:09:55,282
I would have noticed
your dour head

135
00:09:55,316 --> 00:09:57,251
smacking into
the archways.

136
00:09:57,285 --> 00:09:58,786
Move.

137
00:10:04,426 --> 00:10:06,894
- Were you pledged to Stannis?
- Gods, no.

138
00:10:06,928 --> 00:10:08,829
Ah, Renly.

139
00:10:08,864 --> 00:10:10,431
Really?

140
00:10:10,465 --> 00:10:12,166
He wasn't fit
to rule over anything

141
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:14,034
more important than
a 12-course meal.

142
00:10:14,068 --> 00:10:15,636
- Shut your mouth.
- Why?

143
00:10:15,670 --> 00:10:18,939
I lived with him at court since
he was a boy, don't forget.

144
00:10:18,973 --> 00:10:21,074
Could hardly escape
the little tulip.

145
00:10:21,109 --> 00:10:24,110
Skipping down the corridors
in his embroidered silks.

146
00:10:24,145 --> 00:10:25,979
I knew him
far better than you.

147
00:10:26,013 --> 00:10:27,981
I knew him
as well as anyone.

148
00:10:28,016 --> 00:10:29,550
As a member
of his Kingsguard,

149
00:10:29,584 --> 00:10:31,352
he trusted me
with everything.

150
00:10:31,386 --> 00:10:32,786
He would have been
a wonderful king.

151
00:10:32,821 --> 00:10:34,288
Sounds like you
quite fancied him.

152
00:10:34,322 --> 00:10:36,557
I did not
fancy him.

153
00:10:36,591 --> 00:10:38,226
Oh, gods, you did.

154
00:10:39,261 --> 00:10:41,095
<i>Did you ever tell him?</i>

155
00:10:41,129 --> 00:10:43,931
No, of course not.

156
00:10:43,965 --> 00:10:46,934
You weren't Renly's
type, I'm afraid.

157
00:10:46,968 --> 00:10:50,805
He preferred curly-haired
little girls like Loras Tyrell.

158
00:10:50,839 --> 00:10:52,206
You're far too much
man for him.

159
00:10:52,241 --> 00:10:54,041
I'm not interested
in foul rumors.

160
00:10:54,076 --> 00:10:56,077
Unless they're
about me.

161
00:10:56,111 --> 00:10:58,446
It's all true
about Renly.

162
00:10:58,481 --> 00:11:01,383
His proclivities were the
worst kept secret at court.

163
00:11:01,417 --> 00:11:03,752
It's a shame the throne
isn't made out of cocks.

164
00:11:03,786 --> 00:11:06,688
- They'd have never got him off it.
- Shut your mouth!

165
00:11:08,258 --> 00:11:10,259
I don't blame him.

166
00:11:10,293 --> 00:11:12,294
And I don't
blame you, either.

167
00:11:12,329 --> 00:11:15,531
We don't get to choose
who we love.

168
00:11:26,777 --> 00:11:29,545
- Where are you headed, then?
- South.

169
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:31,614
- You?
- Riverrun.

170
00:11:31,648 --> 00:11:34,784
Staying off
the kingsroad, are you?

171
00:11:34,819 --> 00:11:36,987
They get you no matter
where you go.

172
00:11:37,022 --> 00:11:38,656
- You can't win.
- No, you really can't.

173
00:11:38,690 --> 00:11:40,891
Looks like you're
safe enough, though.

174
00:11:40,926 --> 00:11:42,560
Meaning no offense,
my lady, but...

175
00:11:42,594 --> 00:11:44,995
I wouldn't tangle
with you.

176
00:11:46,898 --> 00:11:49,066
- Seven blessings to you.
- And you.

177
00:11:56,241 --> 00:11:58,175
<i>He knows who I am.</i>

178
00:11:58,209 --> 00:11:59,643
- He doesn't.
- Maybe you're right.

179
00:11:59,677 --> 00:12:02,412
But what if you're not?
What if he tells someone?

180
00:12:04,916 --> 00:12:07,318
We're not doing it.

181
00:12:07,352 --> 00:12:09,587
<i>He's an innocent man.</i>

182
00:12:09,621 --> 00:12:12,156
More innocent than
Lady Stark's daughters?

183
00:12:23,801 --> 00:12:25,969
Make it tighter here.

184
00:12:27,071 --> 00:12:28,671
That's better.

185
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:31,707
<i>It makes you look</i>
<i>very strong.</i>

186
00:12:31,742 --> 00:12:33,743
No flowers.

187
00:12:33,777 --> 00:12:35,878
I said no flowers.

188
00:12:37,414 --> 00:12:39,381
All these are wrong.
Bring others.

189
00:12:39,415 --> 00:12:41,383
Yes, Your Grace.

190
00:12:42,551 --> 00:12:44,353
Bloody flowers.

191
00:12:44,387 --> 00:12:46,387
On the king.

192
00:12:46,422 --> 00:12:48,790
Looks like
a Tyrell rose.

193
00:12:48,824 --> 00:12:51,659
Give it to Margaery
for her wedding gown.

194
00:12:51,693 --> 00:12:54,228
Should be more
than enough fabric.

195
00:12:59,234 --> 00:13:01,135
Tell me what
you think of her.

196
00:13:01,169 --> 00:13:02,370
Who?

197
00:13:02,404 --> 00:13:04,439
Margaery.

198
00:13:04,473 --> 00:13:06,374
She's an ideal match.

199
00:13:06,408 --> 00:13:08,343
With the Tyrells beside us,

200
00:13:08,377 --> 00:13:10,579
we'll crush the Northerners.

201
00:13:10,613 --> 00:13:13,782
Hang their lords,
burn their strongholds,

202
00:13:13,816 --> 00:13:15,350
sow their fields
with salt,

203
00:13:15,384 --> 00:13:18,486
and no one will think of
rebelling for another century.

204
00:13:19,922 --> 00:13:23,124
It is a good match, but
what do you think of her?

205
00:13:26,728 --> 00:13:29,197
She's beautiful
and intelligent.

206
00:13:29,231 --> 00:13:30,999
Yes, she is.

207
00:13:31,033 --> 00:13:34,803
Her concern with the well-being of
the common people is interesting.

208
00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:37,339
Not to me.

209
00:13:38,908 --> 00:13:41,310
I only meant that to go out of
your way to endanger yourself--

210
00:13:41,344 --> 00:13:43,646
This is becoming
one of the most boring

211
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:46,115
conversations
I've ever had.

212
00:13:49,453 --> 00:13:53,356
Margaery Tyrell dotes
on filthy urchins for a reason.

213
00:13:53,390 --> 00:13:56,824
She dresses like
a harlot for a reason.

214
00:13:56,859 --> 00:13:59,158
She married a traitor
and known degenerate

215
00:13:59,192 --> 00:14:00,513
like Renly Baratheon
for a reason.

216
00:14:00,527 --> 00:14:04,096
She married Renly Baratheon
because she was told to.

217
00:14:04,130 --> 00:14:06,798
That's what
intelligent women do--

218
00:14:06,832 --> 00:14:08,667
what they're told.

219
00:14:11,871 --> 00:14:15,472
- You need to ask yourself--
- I don't need to do anything.

220
00:14:27,016 --> 00:14:28,783
Better.

221
00:14:30,218 --> 00:14:31,985
Much better.

222
00:14:32,020 --> 00:14:34,354
I still
don't believe it.

223
00:14:34,388 --> 00:14:36,122
He didn't.
He didn't want anything.

224
00:14:36,156 --> 00:14:39,825
He just takes an interest
because he loved my mother.

225
00:14:41,661 --> 00:14:44,796
Men only want one thing
from a pretty girl.

226
00:14:46,765 --> 00:14:49,966
Littlefinger's not
in love with me.

227
00:14:51,568 --> 00:14:54,536
Love is not
the thing he wants.

228
00:14:56,471 --> 00:14:57,972
He's too old.

229
00:14:58,006 --> 00:15:00,174
They never see it
that way.

230
00:15:03,711 --> 00:15:07,013
He didn't ask you
to do something for him?

231
00:15:07,048 --> 00:15:09,248
Spy on someone or...?

232
00:15:09,283 --> 00:15:11,151
No.

233
00:15:16,890 --> 00:15:19,492
If he does ask you
for anything

234
00:15:19,526 --> 00:15:21,494
or try anything

235
00:15:21,562 --> 00:15:24,864
or touch you,
I want you to tell me.

236
00:15:26,067 --> 00:15:28,535
Why?
What will you do?

237
00:15:28,569 --> 00:15:30,203
I will make him stop.

238
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:34,341
<i>Ser Loras Tyrell, my lady.</i>

239
00:15:34,375 --> 00:15:36,843
Send him in.

240
00:15:45,854 --> 00:15:47,521
Lady Sansa.

241
00:15:47,589 --> 00:15:48,922
Ser Loras.

242
00:15:48,957 --> 00:15:50,224
My sister Margaery
invites you to take

243
00:15:50,258 --> 00:15:51,659
the air with her
and our grandmother

244
00:15:51,693 --> 00:15:54,061
the Lady Olenna
in the gardens.

245
00:15:54,095 --> 00:15:56,797
May I escort you
to them?

246
00:16:03,304 --> 00:16:06,306
I believe you grow more beautiful
every day, Lady Sansa.

247
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:08,508
You are too kind,
Ser Loras.

248
00:16:11,312 --> 00:16:14,481
You probably don't remember
the first time we met.

249
00:16:15,883 --> 00:16:18,886
At the Hand's tourney,
you gave me your favor.

250
00:16:20,122 --> 00:16:22,823
A rose,
a red rose.

251
00:16:22,858 --> 00:16:24,525
Of course I did.

252
00:16:27,229 --> 00:16:28,996
<i>It's more your color.</i>

253
00:16:29,031 --> 00:16:31,766
- You take it.
- Thank you.

254
00:16:31,801 --> 00:16:33,668
You're such a dear.

255
00:16:33,703 --> 00:16:35,737
I'll take my leave.

256
00:16:35,771 --> 00:16:37,539
Lady Sansa.

257
00:16:37,573 --> 00:16:39,742
Thank you,
Ser Loras.

258
00:16:39,776 --> 00:16:41,744
Come.

259
00:16:48,219 --> 00:16:50,186
Lady Sansa,
it is my honor

260
00:16:50,221 --> 00:16:52,388
to present
my grandmother...

261
00:16:53,557 --> 00:16:55,925
the Lady Olenna
of House Tyrell.

262
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:57,961
Kiss me, child.

263
00:16:58,029 --> 00:17:00,030
It's so good of you
to visit me

264
00:17:00,064 --> 00:17:01,932
and my foolish
flock of hens.

265
00:17:01,966 --> 00:17:04,335
We're very sorry
for your losses.

266
00:17:04,369 --> 00:17:08,038
And I was sorry when I heard of
Lord Renly's death, Lady Margaery.

267
00:17:08,073 --> 00:17:10,274
- He was very gallant.
- Gallant, yes.

268
00:17:10,308 --> 00:17:12,543
And charming
and very clean.

269
00:17:12,611 --> 00:17:14,478
He knew how
to dress and smile

270
00:17:14,513 --> 00:17:17,348
and somehow this gave him the
notion he was fit to be king.

271
00:17:17,382 --> 00:17:19,383
Renly was brave
and gentle, Grandmother.

272
00:17:19,418 --> 00:17:21,085
Father liked him
and so did Loras.

273
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:22,754
Loras is young
and very good

274
00:17:22,788 --> 00:17:24,723
at knocking men
off horses with a stick.

275
00:17:24,757 --> 00:17:27,425
That does not
make him wise.

276
00:17:27,460 --> 00:17:28,827
As to your
fathead father--

277
00:17:28,861 --> 00:17:31,663
Grandmother!
What will Sansa think of us?

278
00:17:31,697 --> 00:17:34,098
<i>She might think we have</i>
<i>some wits about us.</i>

279
00:17:34,133 --> 00:17:35,833
One of us,
at any rate.

280
00:17:35,901 --> 00:17:38,603
It was treason.
I warned them.

281
00:17:38,671 --> 00:17:41,573
Robert has two sons and
Renly has an older brother.

282
00:17:41,607 --> 00:17:43,708
How could he possibly
have any claim

283
00:17:43,743 --> 00:17:46,344
to that ugly
iron chair?

284
00:17:46,378 --> 00:17:49,414
We should have stayed well out
of all this if you ask me.

285
00:17:49,448 --> 00:17:51,316
But once
the cow's been milked,

286
00:17:51,351 --> 00:17:53,919
there's no squirting
the cream back up her udders.

287
00:17:53,953 --> 00:17:55,989
So here we are
to see things through.

288
00:17:56,023 --> 00:17:58,626
What do you say
to that, Sansa?

289
00:17:59,761 --> 00:18:01,696
Shall we have
some lemon cakes?

290
00:18:01,730 --> 00:18:03,297
Lemon cake's my favorite.

291
00:18:03,332 --> 00:18:05,466
So we've been told.

292
00:18:05,501 --> 00:18:09,003
Are you going to bring the food or
do you mean to starve us to death?

293
00:18:09,905 --> 00:18:11,839
Here, Sansa,

294
00:18:11,873 --> 00:18:13,975
come sit with me.

295
00:18:14,009 --> 00:18:17,445
I'm much less boring
than these others.

296
00:18:19,615 --> 00:18:22,217
Do you know my son?

297
00:18:22,251 --> 00:18:24,085
The Lord of Highgarden?

298
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:26,321
I haven't had
the pleasure.

299
00:18:26,389 --> 00:18:28,323
No great pleasure,
believe me.

300
00:18:28,357 --> 00:18:29,858
A ponderous oaf.

301
00:18:29,892 --> 00:18:31,893
<i>His father</i>
<i>was an oaf as well.</i>

302
00:18:31,928 --> 00:18:34,696
<i>My husband,</i>
<i>the late Lord Luthor.</i>

303
00:18:34,731 --> 00:18:37,632
He managed to ride off
a cliff whilst hawking.

304
00:18:37,667 --> 00:18:39,835
They say he was looking
up at the sky

305
00:18:39,869 --> 00:18:43,372
and paying no mind to where
his horse was taking him.

306
00:18:43,406 --> 00:18:45,407
And now my son
is doing the same,

307
00:18:45,441 --> 00:18:49,111
only this time he's riding
a lion instead of a horse.

308
00:18:49,146 --> 00:18:51,714
Now...

309
00:18:51,782 --> 00:18:54,117
I want you
to tell me the truth

310
00:18:54,152 --> 00:18:58,088
about this royal boy,
this Joffrey.

311
00:18:58,122 --> 00:19:00,290
I... I...

312
00:19:00,325 --> 00:19:01,759
You, you.

313
00:19:01,793 --> 00:19:03,527
Who else
would know better?

314
00:19:03,562 --> 00:19:06,364
We've heard
some troubling tales.

315
00:19:06,398 --> 00:19:09,133
Is there any truth
to them?

316
00:19:09,167 --> 00:19:11,569
<i>Has this boy</i>
<i>mistreated you?</i>

317
00:19:11,603 --> 00:19:13,938
Has he ripped out
your tongue?

318
00:19:13,973 --> 00:19:16,407
Joff-- King Joffrey,

319
00:19:16,441 --> 00:19:19,677
he-- His Grace
is very fair

320
00:19:19,711 --> 00:19:22,780
and handsome
and as brave as a lion.

321
00:19:22,814 --> 00:19:25,416
Yes, all Lannisters
are lions.

322
00:19:25,450 --> 00:19:29,153
And when a Tyrell farts,
it smells like a rose.

323
00:19:29,187 --> 00:19:31,455
<i>But how kind is he?</i>
<i>How clever?</i>

324
00:19:31,489 --> 00:19:33,991
Has he a good heart,
a gentle hand?

325
00:19:34,025 --> 00:19:35,459
I'm to be his wife.

326
00:19:35,493 --> 00:19:37,694
I only want to know
what that means.

327
00:19:45,269 --> 00:19:47,037
Bring me some cheese.

328
00:19:47,071 --> 00:19:49,439
The cheese will be served
after the cakes, my lady.

329
00:19:49,506 --> 00:19:51,774
The cheese will be served
when I want it served.

330
00:19:51,809 --> 00:19:53,376
And I want it served now.

331
00:19:57,481 --> 00:19:59,582
Are you frightened, child?

332
00:19:59,650 --> 00:20:01,517
No need for that.

333
00:20:01,551 --> 00:20:03,452
We're only women here.

334
00:20:03,487 --> 00:20:06,789
Tell us the truth.
No harm will come to you.

335
00:20:07,858 --> 00:20:10,826
My father always
told the truth.

336
00:20:10,861 --> 00:20:12,928
Yes, he had
that reputation.

337
00:20:12,963 --> 00:20:15,397
And they named him traitor
and took his head.

338
00:20:15,432 --> 00:20:18,334
Joffrey.

339
00:20:18,368 --> 00:20:20,269
Joffrey did that.

340
00:20:20,304 --> 00:20:23,673
He promised he would be merciful
and he cut my father's head off.

341
00:20:23,707 --> 00:20:25,508
And he said
that was mercy.

342
00:20:25,543 --> 00:20:29,378
Then he took me up on the
walls and made me look at it.

343
00:20:33,016 --> 00:20:35,418
Go on.

344
00:20:36,453 --> 00:20:39,555
I-- I can't.
I never meant--

345
00:20:39,589 --> 00:20:41,791
my father was a traitor.

346
00:20:41,825 --> 00:20:44,260
My brother as well.
I have traitor's blood.

347
00:20:44,294 --> 00:20:45,962
Please don't make me
say anymore.

348
00:20:45,996 --> 00:20:47,496
She's terrified,
Grandmother.

349
00:20:47,531 --> 00:20:50,967
- Just look at her.
- Speak freely, child.

350
00:20:51,001 --> 00:20:54,804
We would never betray
your confidence, I swear it.

351
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:59,675
He's a monster.

352
00:21:00,911 --> 00:21:02,678
Ah.

353
00:21:02,713 --> 00:21:04,647
<i>That's a pity.</i>

354
00:21:04,715 --> 00:21:07,083
Please, don't stop
the wedding.

355
00:21:07,117 --> 00:21:09,785
Have no fear.
The Lord Oaf of Highgarden

356
00:21:09,819 --> 00:21:12,654
<i>is determined that</i>
<i>Margaery shall be queen.</i>

357
00:21:12,689 --> 00:21:16,158
Even so, we thank you
for the truth.

358
00:21:16,192 --> 00:21:18,994
Ah, here comes my cheese.

359
00:21:34,745 --> 00:21:36,211
<i>We're at war.</i>

360
00:21:36,246 --> 00:21:38,781
<i>This march</i>
<i>is a distraction.</i>

361
00:21:38,815 --> 00:21:41,984
My grandfather's funeral
is not a distraction.

362
00:21:42,018 --> 00:21:44,987
- Are we riding to battle at Riverrun?
- No.

363
00:21:45,021 --> 00:21:47,055
Then it's a distraction.

364
00:21:47,090 --> 00:21:50,158
My Uncle Edmure has his
forces garrisoned there.

365
00:21:50,193 --> 00:21:52,060
We need his men.

366
00:21:52,094 --> 00:21:54,396
Unless he's been
breeding them,

367
00:21:54,430 --> 00:21:56,398
he don't have enough
to make a difference.

368
00:21:56,432 --> 00:21:59,034
Have you lost faith
in our cause?

369
00:21:59,068 --> 00:22:02,671
If it's revenge,
I still got faith in it.

370
00:22:02,705 --> 00:22:04,572
If you no longer
believe--

371
00:22:04,607 --> 00:22:07,241
I can believe
till it snows in Dorne.

372
00:22:07,276 --> 00:22:10,879
Don't change the fact
that we've got half the men.

373
00:22:12,514 --> 00:22:15,283
You don't think
we can win?

374
00:22:15,317 --> 00:22:17,452
May I speak my mind,
Your Grace?

375
00:22:17,486 --> 00:22:20,955
Have you not been speaking
your mind, Lord Karstark?

376
00:22:20,989 --> 00:22:23,891
I think you lost this war

377
00:22:23,926 --> 00:22:26,094
the day you married her.

378
00:22:35,372 --> 00:22:37,540
Whoa, whoa.

379
00:22:39,343 --> 00:22:40,643
Your Grace.

380
00:22:40,677 --> 00:22:43,279
You're afraid of her.

381
00:22:43,314 --> 00:22:46,016
- And she knows it.
- I'm not afraid of her.

382
00:22:55,559 --> 00:22:58,227
May I help you,
Lady Stark?

383
00:22:58,295 --> 00:22:59,896
No.

384
00:23:00,898 --> 00:23:02,432
I'm sorry,
I shouldn't have--

385
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:03,967
You can't help
because a mother

386
00:23:04,001 --> 00:23:07,171
makes one for her
children to protect them.

387
00:23:08,907 --> 00:23:11,108
Only a mother
can make them.

388
00:23:17,848 --> 00:23:20,049
You've made them
before?

389
00:23:21,485 --> 00:23:23,752
Twice.

390
00:23:23,787 --> 00:23:25,921
Did they work?

391
00:23:28,158 --> 00:23:30,092
After a fashion.

392
00:23:32,595 --> 00:23:36,365
I prayed for my son Bran
to survive his fall.

393
00:23:40,470 --> 00:23:42,071
Many years before that,

394
00:23:42,105 --> 00:23:44,607
one of the boys came down
with the pox.

395
00:23:46,410 --> 00:23:48,812
Maester Luwin said if he made it
through the night, he'd live.

396
00:23:48,846 --> 00:23:52,649
But it would be
a very long night.

397
00:23:55,086 --> 00:23:58,589
So I sat with him
all through the darkness.

398
00:23:59,791 --> 00:24:03,127
Listened to his ragged
little breaths,

399
00:24:03,161 --> 00:24:05,997
his coughing,
his whimpering.

400
00:24:06,031 --> 00:24:08,132
<i>Which boy?</i>

401
00:24:09,067 --> 00:24:11,302
Jon Snow.

402
00:24:13,539 --> 00:24:15,940
When my husband brought
that baby home from the war,

403
00:24:15,975 --> 00:24:18,443
I couldn't bear
to look at him.

404
00:24:19,612 --> 00:24:20,912
I didn't want
to see those brown

405
00:24:20,947 --> 00:24:24,216
<i>stranger's eyes</i>
<i>staring up at me.</i>

406
00:24:24,284 --> 00:24:27,187
<i>So I prayed to the gods,</i>
<i>take him away.</i>

407
00:24:27,221 --> 00:24:29,722
Make him die.

408
00:24:31,892 --> 00:24:33,692
He got the pox.

409
00:24:36,363 --> 00:24:40,767
<i>And I knew I was the worst</i>
<i>woman who ever lived.</i>

410
00:24:42,669 --> 00:24:44,804
A murderer.

411
00:24:46,207 --> 00:24:49,075
I'd condemned this poor,
innocent child

412
00:24:49,109 --> 00:24:51,544
to a horrible death

413
00:24:51,578 --> 00:24:54,113
all because I was
jealous of his mother.

414
00:24:55,149 --> 00:24:57,550
A woman he didn't
even know.

415
00:24:57,585 --> 00:25:00,754
So I prayed
to all seven gods,

416
00:25:00,788 --> 00:25:03,957
let the boy live.

417
00:25:03,991 --> 00:25:06,426
Let him live

418
00:25:06,461 --> 00:25:08,494
and I'll love him.

419
00:25:08,529 --> 00:25:11,831
I'll be a mother to him.

420
00:25:11,866 --> 00:25:15,602
I'll beg my husband
to give him a true name,

421
00:25:15,637 --> 00:25:18,572
to call him Stark
and be done with it,

422
00:25:18,607 --> 00:25:20,174
to make him one of us.

423
00:25:20,208 --> 00:25:22,476
And he lived.

424
00:25:22,510 --> 00:25:24,312
And he lived.

425
00:25:27,215 --> 00:25:29,650
And I couldn't keep
my promise.

426
00:25:34,089 --> 00:25:36,724
<i>And everything</i>
<i>that's happened since then...</i>

427
00:25:38,527 --> 00:25:41,529
<i>all this horror</i>
<i>that's come to my family...</i>

428
00:25:43,765 --> 00:25:47,802
it's all because I couldn't
love a motherless child.

429
00:25:58,247 --> 00:26:01,083
Was it hard for you
to kill the Halfhand?

430
00:26:03,220 --> 00:26:04,854
Yes.

431
00:26:04,888 --> 00:26:07,323
You liked him?

432
00:26:07,357 --> 00:26:10,025
I like you, but if
you're playing us false,

433
00:26:10,060 --> 00:26:11,994
it won't be hard
for me to kill you.

434
00:26:12,029 --> 00:26:13,763
I've got wildling
blood in my veins.

435
00:26:13,797 --> 00:26:16,866
- These are my people.
- I understand.

436
00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:19,802
Well, how could
you understand?

437
00:26:19,837 --> 00:26:22,104
You want to protect
your people.

438
00:26:22,139 --> 00:26:25,307
Do you know what it takes
to unite 90 clans,

439
00:26:25,342 --> 00:26:27,610
half of whom want
to massacre the other half

440
00:26:27,644 --> 00:26:30,046
for one insult or another?

441
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:33,850
They speak seven different
languages in my army.

442
00:26:33,917 --> 00:26:35,852
<i>The Thenns hate</i>
<i>the Hornfoots.</i>

443
00:26:35,886 --> 00:26:37,787
<i>The Hornfoots hate</i>
<i>the ice-river clans.</i>

444
00:26:37,821 --> 00:26:40,423
Everyone hates
the cave people.

445
00:26:40,457 --> 00:26:43,826
So you know how I got
moon worshippers

446
00:26:43,860 --> 00:26:45,995
and cannibals and giants

447
00:26:46,030 --> 00:26:48,298
to march together
in the same army?

448
00:26:48,332 --> 00:26:49,699
No.

449
00:26:49,733 --> 00:26:52,569
I told them we were
all going to die

450
00:26:52,603 --> 00:26:54,571
if we don't get south.

451
00:26:54,605 --> 00:26:56,740
Because that's the truth.

452
00:27:08,218 --> 00:27:10,420
Shouldn't be long now.

453
00:27:21,399 --> 00:27:23,801
What's wrong with him?

454
00:27:23,835 --> 00:27:25,936
<i>He's a warg.</i>

455
00:27:25,971 --> 00:27:29,040
He can enter the mind of
animals, see through their eyes.

456
00:27:29,074 --> 00:27:30,574
He's scouting for us.

457
00:27:30,642 --> 00:27:33,277
What, you've never
met a warg?

458
00:27:42,953 --> 00:27:44,454
<i>Orell.</i>

459
00:27:53,430 --> 00:27:56,866
Where were you
this time?

460
00:28:01,639 --> 00:28:04,140
The Fist
of the First Men.

461
00:28:04,208 --> 00:28:06,577
What did you see?

462
00:28:10,248 --> 00:28:13,116
Dead crows.

463
00:28:22,426 --> 00:28:23,893
What's the matter, Piggy?

464
00:28:23,928 --> 00:28:25,895
You crying
'cause you're cold?

465
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:32,536
There's 200 brothers
killed by dead men

466
00:28:32,570 --> 00:28:35,071
and you're still here

467
00:28:35,106 --> 00:28:37,641
whimpering.

468
00:28:37,675 --> 00:28:39,876
That seem fair to you?

469
00:28:41,178 --> 00:28:43,013
I seen 'em torn
to pieces fighting

470
00:28:43,047 --> 00:28:45,748
while you was off somewhere
hiding in a hole.

471
00:28:47,251 --> 00:28:49,752
Why don't you lie down
and rest for a while, eh?

472
00:28:51,121 --> 00:28:53,423
You know you want to.

473
00:29:10,272 --> 00:29:12,172
Hey.

474
00:29:17,445 --> 00:29:19,179
Get up, Sam.

475
00:29:19,214 --> 00:29:21,849
- No.
- <i>Get up.</i>

476
00:29:21,883 --> 00:29:23,450
I can't.

477
00:29:23,484 --> 00:29:26,019
If you stop,
you'll die.

478
00:29:26,053 --> 00:29:29,755
'Course if you don't stop,
you'll probably die, too.

479
00:29:29,823 --> 00:29:33,058
- You don't care.
- 'Course we care.

480
00:29:33,093 --> 00:29:35,361
You left me.

481
00:29:35,395 --> 00:29:38,797
When the white walkers came,
you left me.

482
00:29:38,832 --> 00:29:41,467
Aye, we left you.

483
00:29:41,535 --> 00:29:43,836
<i>You're fat and you're slow.</i>

484
00:29:43,871 --> 00:29:46,072
We didn't want to die.

485
00:29:47,675 --> 00:29:49,676
Help me get him up.

486
00:29:50,911 --> 00:29:52,478
Looks like that piggy
is done for.

487
00:29:52,512 --> 00:29:54,647
- Help us get him up.
- He's slowing us down.

488
00:29:54,715 --> 00:29:56,282
Just get him up!

489
00:29:56,317 --> 00:29:59,385
Why? So the rest
of us can die?

490
00:30:00,921 --> 00:30:03,189
We'll move faster
without him.

491
00:30:03,223 --> 00:30:06,659
What is this?
Get up, Tarly.

492
00:30:08,362 --> 00:30:10,597
- Is he all right?
- Aye, I think so.

493
00:30:10,631 --> 00:30:12,398
If he can't, we may as
well just go without him.

494
00:30:12,432 --> 00:30:14,300
That's enough.

495
00:30:14,334 --> 00:30:16,369
Tarly,

496
00:30:16,403 --> 00:30:18,737
I forbid you to die.

497
00:30:18,772 --> 00:30:21,007
Do you hear me?

498
00:30:21,041 --> 00:30:23,742
- Why should the rest of us--
- Rast...

499
00:30:23,777 --> 00:30:26,245
you're responsible
for him.

500
00:30:26,279 --> 00:30:28,313
What am I
supposed to do?

501
00:30:28,348 --> 00:30:30,382
Make sure he gets
back alive.

502
00:30:30,450 --> 00:30:33,184
If he doesn't,
you don't.

503
00:30:34,086 --> 00:30:36,087
Move on!

504
00:30:41,894 --> 00:30:44,262
I'm not dying
for you, Piggy.

505
00:30:44,297 --> 00:30:46,131
You hear me?

506
00:31:11,425 --> 00:31:13,393
Where's Rickon
and Hodor?

507
00:31:13,427 --> 00:31:16,730
Looking for food.

508
00:31:18,566 --> 00:31:21,368
What's out there?

509
00:32:10,586 --> 00:32:13,020
<i>Not another step, boy.</i>

510
00:32:13,055 --> 00:32:15,190
<i>Unless you want to drown</i>
<i>in your own blood.</i>

511
00:32:15,224 --> 00:32:16,591
I'm unarmed.

512
00:32:16,659 --> 00:32:19,460
That was poor planning.

513
00:32:19,495 --> 00:32:21,696
My sister carries
the weapons.

514
00:32:23,332 --> 00:32:26,234
I'm better with them.

515
00:32:26,268 --> 00:32:28,603
<i>Drop the spear.</i>

516
00:32:31,106 --> 00:32:33,207
<i>Drop it.</i>

517
00:32:35,877 --> 00:32:37,678
If you kill me,

518
00:32:37,712 --> 00:32:40,348
that wolf will tear
you to bits.

519
00:32:45,921 --> 00:32:48,824
You must be Summer.

520
00:33:11,782 --> 00:33:14,151
I'm Jojen Reed.

521
00:33:14,185 --> 00:33:17,254
This is my sister Meera.

522
00:33:21,293 --> 00:33:23,961
We've come a long way
to find you, Brandon.

523
00:33:25,130 --> 00:33:27,900
And we have
much farther to go.

524
00:33:31,438 --> 00:33:33,239
I'm just trying
to understand.

525
00:33:33,273 --> 00:33:36,108
Would you please
shut up about it?

526
00:33:36,143 --> 00:33:37,843
Jaqen H'ghar offered
you three kills.

527
00:33:37,877 --> 00:33:40,078
- I'm not listening.
- But just explain it to me.

528
00:33:40,113 --> 00:33:42,815
He offered to kill
any three people you wanted.

529
00:33:42,882 --> 00:33:45,551
Dead. All you had to do
was give him the names.

530
00:33:45,585 --> 00:33:48,287
Anyone.
You could have picked King Joffrey.

531
00:33:48,321 --> 00:33:50,355
- Shut up.
- You could have picked Tywin Lannister.

532
00:33:50,390 --> 00:33:51,857
Jaqen got us
out of Harrenhal,

533
00:33:51,891 --> 00:33:53,625
so why are you
complaining?

534
00:33:53,660 --> 00:33:55,461
But you could have
ended the war.

535
00:33:55,495 --> 00:33:58,230
- Where are we going?
- North.

536
00:33:58,264 --> 00:33:59,665
If we were going north,

537
00:33:59,699 --> 00:34:01,333
we should have come
to the Red Fork River by now.

538
00:34:01,368 --> 00:34:03,502
Maybe we already
passed it.

539
00:34:03,536 --> 00:34:05,170
It's 100 feet wide.

540
00:34:05,205 --> 00:34:07,438
How could we have
passed it?

541
00:34:08,507 --> 00:34:09,907
If we hit the Red Fork,

542
00:34:09,942 --> 00:34:11,409
we can follow it west
to Riverrun.

543
00:34:11,444 --> 00:34:12,944
My mother grew up there.

544
00:34:12,979 --> 00:34:15,313
My grandfather's a lord.
He'll protect us.

545
00:34:18,284 --> 00:34:19,851
Could be a minstrel.

546
00:34:19,885 --> 00:34:22,020
Shut up.

547
00:34:22,055 --> 00:34:24,457
<i>? A lion</i>
<i>still has claws... ?</i>

548
00:34:24,491 --> 00:34:26,692
<i>A minstrel's got</i>
<i>gold sometimes.</i>

549
00:34:26,727 --> 00:34:30,163
<i>We could jump him,</i>
<i>tie him up, steal his gold,</i>

550
00:34:30,198 --> 00:34:32,632
- and buy some food.
- Shh.

551
00:34:32,667 --> 00:34:36,603
? And so he spoke,
and so he spoke ?

552
00:34:36,637 --> 00:34:39,873
<i>? That Lord</i>
<i>of Castamere ?</i>

553
00:34:39,907 --> 00:34:42,075
? But now the rains ?

554
00:34:42,110 --> 00:34:44,244
? Weep o'er his hall ?

555
00:34:44,279 --> 00:34:47,647
? With no one there
to hear. ?

556
00:34:51,186 --> 00:34:53,620
<i>What's lurking</i>
<i>behind that wall?</i>

557
00:34:53,654 --> 00:34:56,623
<i>A lion?</i>
<i>A wolf?</i>

558
00:34:56,658 --> 00:34:59,193
<i>Just a dirty little cub,</i>
<i>I think.</i>

559
00:34:59,227 --> 00:35:01,528
<i>- Loose a few more shafts.</i>
- Don't.

560
00:35:13,540 --> 00:35:15,875
Put the sword down, girl.

561
00:35:15,909 --> 00:35:18,478
You go on down the road.

562
00:35:18,512 --> 00:35:20,480
Just keep on singing
so we know where you are.

563
00:35:20,514 --> 00:35:24,117
Leave us be
and I won't kill you.

564
00:35:27,121 --> 00:35:28,755
Generous.

565
00:35:28,789 --> 00:35:31,258
You're a dangerous person.

566
00:35:31,292 --> 00:35:34,128
I like dangerous people.

567
00:35:36,431 --> 00:35:38,833
Why are your friends
so shy?

568
00:35:40,236 --> 00:35:42,003
What friends?

569
00:35:42,037 --> 00:35:45,274
The fat one to your left
and the lad beside him.

570
00:36:06,163 --> 00:36:08,164
Three young ones
on the run

571
00:36:08,198 --> 00:36:11,668
carrying
castle-forged swords.

572
00:36:11,702 --> 00:36:13,202
You escape
from Harrenhal?

573
00:36:13,237 --> 00:36:15,838
<i>- Who are you?</i>
- Thoros of Myr.

574
00:36:15,872 --> 00:36:17,907
And the fellow here
with the bow is Anguy.

575
00:36:17,975 --> 00:36:19,342
No, who do you
fight for?

576
00:36:19,376 --> 00:36:21,411
<i>The Brotherhood</i>
<i>without Banners.</i>

577
00:36:23,681 --> 00:36:25,982
Now come along.

578
00:36:26,016 --> 00:36:27,617
I want to hear
how two boys

579
00:36:27,652 --> 00:36:31,188
and a very dangerous girl
escaped Harrenhal.

580
00:36:31,222 --> 00:36:33,891
I'm not going with them.
The Brotherhood?

581
00:36:33,925 --> 00:36:36,461
That's who the Mountain
and them lot were looking for.

582
00:36:36,495 --> 00:36:38,296
They'll bring us back
and put rats in us.

583
00:36:38,330 --> 00:36:40,330
You've got nothing
to fear from us, son.

584
00:36:40,365 --> 00:36:43,166
The lords of Westeros
want to burn the countryside.

585
00:36:43,201 --> 00:36:45,101
We're trying to save it.

586
00:36:45,136 --> 00:36:46,737
Now come on.

587
00:36:46,771 --> 00:36:49,472
We'll talk some more
over brown bread and stew.

588
00:36:49,506 --> 00:36:51,607
And then you can go
on your way.

589
00:36:59,049 --> 00:37:01,251
Here's the thing, fat boy.

590
00:37:04,823 --> 00:37:06,090
When I'm done talking,

591
00:37:06,124 --> 00:37:09,027
that arrow's falling down
on your fat head.

592
00:37:09,061 --> 00:37:12,429
So I advise you move,
because I'm done talking.

593
00:37:27,511 --> 00:37:30,779
Half the country's starving
and look at this one.

594
00:37:30,814 --> 00:37:33,282
Maybe he's the reason
half the country's starving.

595
00:37:42,626 --> 00:37:45,161
My lion.

596
00:37:45,195 --> 00:37:48,898
We've spoken of this.

597
00:37:48,933 --> 00:37:51,634
You cannot come here.

598
00:37:54,505 --> 00:37:57,407
But you said I should come
to you with any problems.

599
00:37:57,441 --> 00:37:59,242
Did anyone see you?

600
00:37:59,276 --> 00:38:01,444
- No.
- You sure?

601
00:38:01,479 --> 00:38:03,780
My father does not
make idle threats.

602
00:38:03,815 --> 00:38:07,151
Having you killed would be
the high point of his week.

603
00:38:07,185 --> 00:38:09,187
You have to be
absolutely certain.

604
00:38:13,058 --> 00:38:14,893
All right.

605
00:38:14,927 --> 00:38:16,928
What is this problem?

606
00:38:18,697 --> 00:38:20,798
I'm worried about Sansa.

607
00:38:20,833 --> 00:38:22,666
When she spoke
with Lord Baelish,

608
00:38:22,701 --> 00:38:26,137
his friend warned me
about him.

609
00:38:26,171 --> 00:38:28,272
Baelish doesn't
have friends.

610
00:38:29,441 --> 00:38:31,042
I don't know her name.

611
00:38:31,076 --> 00:38:34,211
- Oh, Ros? The redhead?
- How do you know her?

612
00:38:34,246 --> 00:38:36,447
I try to know
as many people as I can.

613
00:38:36,481 --> 00:38:38,249
You never know
which one you'll need.

614
00:38:38,283 --> 00:38:40,017
She's a whore.

615
00:38:40,052 --> 00:38:43,153
Yes, well, we shouldn't be
judgmental about these things.

616
00:38:43,188 --> 00:38:46,490
- You fucked her.
- Oh, please.

617
00:38:46,525 --> 00:38:49,260
All right, yes,
I fucked her once.

618
00:38:51,563 --> 00:38:52,896
Twice.

619
00:38:54,298 --> 00:38:57,000
But since I met you,
my lady,

620
00:38:57,034 --> 00:38:59,502
I've been with
no one else.

621
00:39:01,606 --> 00:39:04,641
And was she good?
Did you like her?

622
00:39:04,675 --> 00:39:06,376
Not as much
as I like you, obviously,

623
00:39:06,444 --> 00:39:09,179
or she'd be the one
torturing me right now.

624
00:39:12,283 --> 00:39:14,885
What did she say
about Littlefinger?

625
00:39:17,455 --> 00:39:19,189
That Sansa
shouldn't trust him.

626
00:39:19,224 --> 00:39:22,126
Is there an idiot
in any village

627
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:24,128
who trusts Littlefinger?

628
00:39:26,631 --> 00:39:28,465
We have to protect her.

629
00:39:28,499 --> 00:39:29,700
We can't.

630
00:39:29,734 --> 00:39:32,669
Now that the Lannisters
have discarded her,

631
00:39:32,737 --> 00:39:35,105
Sansa will have
many suitors.

632
00:39:35,139 --> 00:39:38,375
A great beauty
with a very old name.

633
00:39:38,409 --> 00:39:41,545
A great beauty?
Oh, a great beauty?

634
00:39:41,579 --> 00:39:44,648
Yes, she is,
objectively, very.

635
00:39:44,682 --> 00:39:47,217
Her face
is quite pleasing--

636
00:39:47,251 --> 00:39:48,919
to other men
and to women,

637
00:39:48,953 --> 00:39:50,821
people in general.

638
00:39:50,855 --> 00:39:52,790
But not to me,
of course.

639
00:39:52,824 --> 00:39:55,993
I only have eyes
for you.

640
00:39:56,027 --> 00:39:58,662
You pervert.
You want her?

641
00:39:58,697 --> 00:40:01,865
- This child?
- I don't even want to talk about her.

642
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:04,635
- But you are.
- Only because you're making me.

643
00:40:04,669 --> 00:40:08,171
I didn't force you
to open your mouth

644
00:40:08,206 --> 00:40:10,240
and make words come out.

645
00:40:10,275 --> 00:40:13,477
This is cruel and unfair.
Cruelly unfair.

646
00:40:13,511 --> 00:40:15,245
"Oh, the cruelty.

647
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:17,715
Shae is so cruel to me."

648
00:40:19,884 --> 00:40:21,852
Hmm, yes.

649
00:40:30,862 --> 00:40:33,130
Now do you think
I'm cruel?

650
00:40:34,265 --> 00:40:35,932
Only if you stop.

651
00:40:38,069 --> 00:40:40,772
But you mustn't
come here again.

652
00:40:43,542 --> 00:40:45,777
Do you hear me?

653
00:40:47,413 --> 00:40:49,748
You've come to
a dangerous place

654
00:40:49,782 --> 00:40:52,317
full of dangerous people.

655
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:57,522
Dangerous people.

656
00:41:07,133 --> 00:41:08,833
<i>Lady Tyrell, my king.</i>

657
00:41:08,868 --> 00:41:10,735
Send her in.

658
00:41:25,385 --> 00:41:27,786
You wanted to see me,
Your Grace?

659
00:41:27,821 --> 00:41:29,555
I'm leaving
on a hunting trip.

660
00:41:29,589 --> 00:41:31,957
I just wanted
to make sure

661
00:41:31,992 --> 00:41:33,859
you had everything
you need before I left.

662
00:41:33,893 --> 00:41:36,128
That's very thoughtful,
Your Grace.

663
00:41:36,162 --> 00:41:37,930
I have everything
I could want.

664
00:41:37,964 --> 00:41:39,165
Good. Good.

665
00:41:39,199 --> 00:41:41,901
How are you finding life
in the capital?

666
00:41:41,935 --> 00:41:44,603
It must be quite a change
after Renly's camp.

667
00:41:44,638 --> 00:41:46,505
A welcome one.

668
00:41:46,540 --> 00:41:50,876
A military encampment
is no place for a lady.

669
00:41:50,911 --> 00:41:53,312
And the bedside
of a traitor?

670
00:41:55,782 --> 00:41:58,383
Is that a place
for a lady?

671
00:41:59,252 --> 00:42:02,354
Your Grace,

672
00:42:02,388 --> 00:42:05,324
I tried to do my duty
as a wife, that is all.

673
00:42:05,358 --> 00:42:08,927
What was your duty to this
traitor as you saw it?

674
00:42:08,995 --> 00:42:11,163
The duty of any wife
to any husband--

675
00:42:11,197 --> 00:42:12,897
to provide him
with children.

676
00:42:12,932 --> 00:42:14,999
<i>You failed to do this.</i>

677
00:42:15,034 --> 00:42:18,236
- Why?
- <i>I--</i>

678
00:42:20,439 --> 00:42:23,240
I would not speak ill
of the dead, Your Grace.

679
00:42:23,274 --> 00:42:25,208
You think one ought
to speak kindly

680
00:42:25,243 --> 00:42:28,045
of a traitor merely because he's
had a sword put through his heart?

681
00:42:28,079 --> 00:42:29,913
No.

682
00:42:29,948 --> 00:42:32,783
I do beg your pardon.

683
00:42:32,817 --> 00:42:36,086
The subtleties of politics
are often lost on me.

684
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:38,522
Renly...

685
00:42:40,291 --> 00:42:43,026
I don't believe
he was interested

686
00:42:43,061 --> 00:42:45,462
<i>in the company</i>
<i>of women.</i>

687
00:42:47,098 --> 00:42:48,932
What makes you say this?

688
00:42:50,335 --> 00:42:54,205
Whenever I wanted
to make a child with him,

689
00:42:54,239 --> 00:42:56,674
he--

690
00:42:56,709 --> 00:42:58,743
he had so many
excuses,

691
00:42:58,777 --> 00:43:00,912
so many late-night
war councils.

692
00:43:00,946 --> 00:43:03,281
He never wanted
to try.

693
00:43:04,650 --> 00:43:07,418
Except one evening,

694
00:43:07,452 --> 00:43:10,254
after he'd had far too
much wine to drink,

695
00:43:10,289 --> 00:43:12,757
he suggested something--

696
00:43:16,228 --> 00:43:19,797
something that sounded
very painful

697
00:43:19,864 --> 00:43:21,932
and couldn't possibly
result in children.

698
00:43:24,069 --> 00:43:25,869
Maybe the fault
was with me.

699
00:43:25,904 --> 00:43:28,939
No, he was a known...

700
00:43:28,973 --> 00:43:30,541
degenerate.

701
00:43:31,976 --> 00:43:34,010
It's such a relief to hear
you say so, Your Grace.

702
00:43:34,044 --> 00:43:35,745
Mmm.

703
00:43:35,779 --> 00:43:38,481
I've considered
making his perversion

704
00:43:38,515 --> 00:43:40,516
punishable by death.

705
00:43:41,618 --> 00:43:44,686
As is your right.

706
00:43:44,721 --> 00:43:48,290
You must do whatever
you need to do.

707
00:43:52,127 --> 00:43:53,528
You are the king.

708
00:43:53,562 --> 00:43:55,764
Yes.

709
00:43:58,501 --> 00:44:00,202
I am.

710
00:44:06,343 --> 00:44:07,810
Do you like it?

711
00:44:07,844 --> 00:44:09,745
I just had it made.

712
00:44:09,780 --> 00:44:12,548
Probably one of the finest
weapons in the Seven Kingdoms.

713
00:44:12,582 --> 00:44:13,983
It's beautiful.

714
00:44:14,017 --> 00:44:16,218
Will you show me
how it works?

715
00:44:20,457 --> 00:44:21,991
It's a new design.

716
00:44:22,026 --> 00:44:24,460
Much easier to load.
There's no crank.

717
00:44:24,494 --> 00:44:28,464
You use this lever
to draw the string.

718
00:44:33,903 --> 00:44:36,072
The bolt goes here.

719
00:44:38,441 --> 00:44:42,111
And then you just aim...

720
00:44:44,348 --> 00:44:46,449
and...

721
00:44:50,220 --> 00:44:53,956
Would you take me
hunting sometime?

722
00:44:53,990 --> 00:44:55,924
Forgive me, Your Grace.

723
00:44:55,959 --> 00:44:58,093
I know a hunt
is no place for a woman.

724
00:44:58,127 --> 00:44:59,695
It's not unheard of.

725
00:44:59,729 --> 00:45:02,031
My father would never
let me before--

726
00:45:02,065 --> 00:45:04,466
You no longer
belong to him.

727
00:45:05,501 --> 00:45:07,436
Do you want
to hold it?

728
00:45:07,470 --> 00:45:09,538
May I?
Please.

729
00:45:17,181 --> 00:45:19,516
I imagine it must be
so exciting

730
00:45:19,550 --> 00:45:21,551
to squeeze
your finger here

731
00:45:21,585 --> 00:45:24,254
and watch something
die over there.

732
00:45:28,292 --> 00:45:30,793
Could you do it?

733
00:45:30,827 --> 00:45:32,828
Could you...

734
00:45:32,862 --> 00:45:35,164
kill something?

735
00:45:36,633 --> 00:45:38,834
I don't know, Your Grace.
Do you think I could?

736
00:45:38,869 --> 00:45:41,203
Yes.

737
00:45:41,238 --> 00:45:43,639
Would you like
to watch me?

738
00:45:47,678 --> 00:45:49,579
Yes.

739
00:45:51,148 --> 00:45:53,850
Stop! Stop!

740
00:45:53,884 --> 00:45:56,253
- <i>Tell us the truth.</i>
- About what?

741
00:45:57,722 --> 00:46:00,224
I don't
know what you want.

742
00:46:00,258 --> 00:46:02,492
I want the truth.

743
00:46:02,527 --> 00:46:04,294
What truth?

744
00:46:04,329 --> 00:46:06,296
Why'd you take
Winterfell?

745
00:46:06,330 --> 00:46:08,732
I took it to--
I took it--

746
00:46:08,766 --> 00:46:10,167
- Who gave the orders?
- No one.

747
00:46:10,201 --> 00:46:11,735
- I took it on my own.
- <i>Why?</i>

748
00:46:11,769 --> 00:46:13,770
To take the North
while it was vulnerable.

749
00:46:13,805 --> 00:46:15,539
What were you going
to do once you took it?

750
00:46:15,573 --> 00:46:17,307
Hold it.
Rule it.

751
00:46:17,341 --> 00:46:21,044
Good.
That's very good.

752
00:46:26,016 --> 00:46:27,717
Why did you do that?
I told you.

753
00:46:27,752 --> 00:46:29,386
Why did you take
Winterfell?

754
00:46:29,420 --> 00:46:32,688
I took it to bring glory
to my house and my father.

755
00:46:40,464 --> 00:46:42,465
Wait.
Wait, wait, wait.

756
00:46:42,500 --> 00:46:45,935
I took it because
I hated the Starks.

757
00:46:45,970 --> 00:46:48,338
I hated them
for holding me prisoner.

758
00:46:48,372 --> 00:46:50,807
I wanted to hurt them.

759
00:46:56,613 --> 00:46:58,681
What are you doing?

760
00:47:01,718 --> 00:47:03,853
Please.

761
00:47:08,926 --> 00:47:11,760
I'll tell you anything.

762
00:47:11,795 --> 00:47:13,796
Just take it off.

763
00:47:13,830 --> 00:47:16,932
<i>Please.</i>
<i>Please, just take it off.</i>

764
00:47:26,075 --> 00:47:29,244
- Your sister sent me.
- Yara?

765
00:47:36,353 --> 00:47:38,855
I'll come for you tonight
when the castle sleeps.

766
00:47:38,889 --> 00:47:40,924
No, don't go.
Please, please.

767
00:47:40,958 --> 00:47:42,626
No, please
don't leave me.

768
00:47:42,660 --> 00:47:44,361
Please, please.

769
00:47:44,395 --> 00:47:45,796
Please,
please don't go!

770
00:47:45,830 --> 00:47:50,535
Please. Please.
Don't leave me.

771
00:47:50,569 --> 00:47:53,237
Please don't go.

772
00:47:57,976 --> 00:48:00,110
Rickon,
stay with us.

773
00:48:01,445 --> 00:48:04,881
It's all right.
The wolves will protect him.

774
00:48:14,225 --> 00:48:16,160
You can get
inside his head,

775
00:48:16,194 --> 00:48:18,295
see through his eyes.

776
00:48:18,329 --> 00:48:19,696
Only when I'm asleep.

777
00:48:19,731 --> 00:48:22,266
That's how it begins until
you learn to control it.

778
00:48:22,300 --> 00:48:23,667
You're a warg.

779
00:48:23,702 --> 00:48:26,403
It's not just wolves.

780
00:48:26,438 --> 00:48:28,238
Sometimes in my dreams
there's a--

781
00:48:28,273 --> 00:48:31,008
- A three-eyed raven?
- <i>You've seen it?</i>

782
00:48:31,042 --> 00:48:33,277
We saw him together.
You haven't forgotten?

783
00:48:33,311 --> 00:48:36,013
Does it have anything
to do with warging?

784
00:48:36,047 --> 00:48:38,782
No, the raven
is something different,

785
00:48:38,816 --> 00:48:41,151
something deeper.

786
00:48:41,185 --> 00:48:42,652
The raven brings
the sight.

787
00:48:42,686 --> 00:48:45,655
Seeing things
that haven't happened yet?

788
00:48:45,689 --> 00:48:47,924
<i>Or things that happened</i>
<i>long before you were born</i>

789
00:48:47,958 --> 00:48:51,661
or things that are happening right
now thousands of miles away.

790
00:48:51,696 --> 00:48:54,030
What's he telling him?

791
00:48:54,065 --> 00:48:56,266
Why don't you ask?

792
00:48:57,801 --> 00:48:59,736
Isn't he ashamed,
your brother,

793
00:48:59,770 --> 00:49:01,471
needing you
to protect him?

794
00:49:02,606 --> 00:49:04,273
Where's the shame in that?

795
00:49:04,308 --> 00:49:07,910
Any boy his age who needs
his sister to protect him

796
00:49:07,945 --> 00:49:11,780
is gonna find himself
needing lots of protecting.

797
00:49:13,016 --> 00:49:16,218
Some people
will always need help.

798
00:49:16,252 --> 00:49:18,587
<i>That doesn't mean</i>
<i>they're not worth helping.</i>

799
00:49:22,926 --> 00:49:26,262
When my father died,
I dreamt it.

800
00:49:26,296 --> 00:49:29,632
You didn't dream it.
You saw it.

801
00:49:29,700 --> 00:49:31,601
So did I.

802
00:49:31,635 --> 00:49:33,236
You have the sight, too?

803
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:40,376
When I told my father
about your father...

804
00:49:41,812 --> 00:49:44,947
for the first time
in my life, I saw him cry.

805
00:49:44,981 --> 00:49:46,682
Your father
is Howland Reed?

806
00:49:46,716 --> 00:49:48,416
Yeah.

807
00:49:48,451 --> 00:49:51,720
He saved my father's life
during the rebellion.

808
00:49:51,754 --> 00:49:53,555
Your father told you
about the rebellion?

809
00:49:53,589 --> 00:49:55,590
Mine never did.

810
00:49:55,625 --> 00:49:57,459
But I saw that, too.

811
00:49:57,493 --> 00:50:00,695
What else have you seen?

812
00:50:00,730 --> 00:50:02,697
Only one thing
that matters--

813
00:50:02,732 --> 00:50:04,833
you.

814
00:50:15,745 --> 00:50:17,546
<i>I never liked</i>
<i>the skinny ones.</i>

815
00:50:17,581 --> 00:50:19,448
<i>Like drinking</i>
<i>from a puddle.</i>

816
00:50:19,483 --> 00:50:21,284
Not that I'm averse
to drinking from a puddle

817
00:50:21,318 --> 00:50:22,619
every now and again,
you understand.

818
00:50:22,653 --> 00:50:24,654
I don't drink ale.

819
00:50:24,689 --> 00:50:27,391
There's no story so good
a drink won't make it better.

820
00:50:27,425 --> 00:50:29,159
- Yeah!
- You see?

821
00:50:29,194 --> 00:50:31,429
They've all suffered through
my bouts of sobriety.

822
00:50:31,463 --> 00:50:33,764
It's very tedious
for all concerned.

823
00:50:33,798 --> 00:50:36,266
Now, how did
three children--

824
00:50:36,301 --> 00:50:37,835
We're not children.

825
00:50:37,869 --> 00:50:40,604
How did three young persons
such as yourselves,

826
00:50:40,638 --> 00:50:43,207
untrained
in the art of war,

827
00:50:43,241 --> 00:50:44,876
escape from Harrenhal?

828
00:50:47,245 --> 00:50:49,213
Gendry's a smith.

829
00:50:49,248 --> 00:50:50,915
He was apprenticed
in the armory.

830
00:50:50,949 --> 00:50:54,252
A smith, eh?
Where'd you train?

831
00:50:57,389 --> 00:51:00,225
King's Landing.
Tobho Mott's shop.

832
00:51:00,259 --> 00:51:02,394
That criminal.
He charges twice as much

833
00:51:02,428 --> 00:51:03,895
as every other armorer
in the city.

834
00:51:03,930 --> 00:51:05,564
That's because
he's twice as good.

835
00:51:05,631 --> 00:51:08,967
Aha! A smith
and a salesman.

836
00:51:09,002 --> 00:51:11,236
Gendry stole us weapons.

837
00:51:11,271 --> 00:51:14,106
Ah, fought your way
out of Harrenhal, I see.

838
00:51:14,140 --> 00:51:17,676
He knows how to use a
sword and so do I.

839
00:51:19,145 --> 00:51:21,213
My brothers taught me.

840
00:51:24,684 --> 00:51:27,853
Ooh!

841
00:51:42,268 --> 00:51:45,571
To your brothers!

842
00:51:51,878 --> 00:51:54,446
You can finish
your meals before you go.

843
00:51:54,481 --> 00:51:56,915
It may be awhile
before you see another.

844
00:51:56,950 --> 00:51:59,985
- You'll free us?
- I gave you my word.

845
00:52:02,721 --> 00:52:04,489
But before you go,

846
00:52:04,523 --> 00:52:07,791
allow me to raise
a cup to your--

847
00:52:07,826 --> 00:52:10,394
Hey, hey.

848
00:52:10,428 --> 00:52:13,130
Now that is an uncommonly
large person.

849
00:52:13,165 --> 00:52:14,699
How does one
manage to subdue

850
00:52:14,733 --> 00:52:16,500
such an uncommonly
large person?

851
00:52:16,534 --> 00:52:19,236
One waits for him to drink
until he passes out.

852
00:52:19,271 --> 00:52:22,072
Poor man.
You have my sympathy.

853
00:52:24,042 --> 00:52:27,377
Aha, not a man at all.

854
00:52:28,513 --> 00:52:31,481
A Hound!

855
00:52:31,549 --> 00:52:34,117
So good to see
you again, Clegane.

856
00:52:34,152 --> 00:52:36,119
Thoros?

857
00:52:36,154 --> 00:52:38,555
The fuck you doing here?

858
00:52:38,589 --> 00:52:40,490
Drinking and talking
too much.

859
00:52:40,525 --> 00:52:42,526
Same as ever.

860
00:52:42,560 --> 00:52:46,063
- A pretty prize, lads.
- Yeah!

861
00:52:47,966 --> 00:52:49,734
Girl.

862
00:52:51,703 --> 00:52:53,271
What in seven hells

863
00:52:53,305 --> 00:52:55,774
are you doing
with the Stark bitch?

864
00:53:06,820 --> 00:53:09,389
It's a tough decision--

865
00:53:09,423 --> 00:53:11,424
take the bridge
and risk being seen

866
00:53:11,459 --> 00:53:13,360
or cross the great water.

867
00:53:13,394 --> 00:53:15,962
- Silence, Kingslayer.
- Anyone can see us on the bridge,

868
00:53:15,996 --> 00:53:18,999
but cross by water
and the current could take us

869
00:53:19,033 --> 00:53:21,000
or I could escape
down the river.

870
00:53:21,035 --> 00:53:22,902
Good luck.

871
00:53:24,872 --> 00:53:28,908
It's wonderful to watch you
wrestle with these dilemmas.

872
00:53:28,943 --> 00:53:31,077
Which will she choose?

873
00:53:35,984 --> 00:53:37,951
Gambler at heart.

874
00:53:37,986 --> 00:53:39,420
Wouldn't have guessed.

875
00:53:39,454 --> 00:53:41,589
Be quick about it.

876
00:53:48,698 --> 00:53:50,098
- I need to rest.
- Get up.

877
00:53:50,132 --> 00:53:52,567
I have these, you know, on your
feet when you walk too far.

878
00:53:52,601 --> 00:53:53,768
- What do you call them?
- Get up now.

879
00:53:53,802 --> 00:53:56,304
Corns.
I never used to get corns.

880
00:53:56,338 --> 00:53:58,672
<i>Of course I used</i>
<i>to ride everywhere,</i>

881
00:53:58,707 --> 00:54:01,175
not march around
like a common foot soldier

882
00:54:01,209 --> 00:54:03,443
wearing the same shit boots
for over a year.

883
00:54:03,478 --> 00:54:05,879
This heel is ruined.
There's no way--

884
00:54:13,987 --> 00:54:17,624
I never understood why some knights
felt the need to carry two swords.

885
00:54:32,407 --> 00:54:34,708
Ooh.

886
00:54:38,078 --> 00:54:40,480
You move well...

887
00:54:43,183 --> 00:54:45,484
for a great beast
of a woman.

888
00:54:49,421 --> 00:54:51,489
You shouldn't grimace
before you lunge.

889
00:54:51,523 --> 00:54:54,024
It gives away the game.

890
00:55:07,572 --> 00:55:09,874
<i>Bit of a quandary</i>
<i>for you.</i>

891
00:55:09,908 --> 00:55:12,777
If you kill me,
you fail Lady Stark.

892
00:55:12,811 --> 00:55:15,413
<i>But if you don't kill me,</i>

893
00:55:15,447 --> 00:55:17,749
I'm going to kill you.

894
00:55:23,623 --> 00:55:25,457
You're good.

895
00:55:25,492 --> 00:55:27,693
Graceless, but good.

896
00:55:36,703 --> 00:55:38,971
See? If you were
willing to hurt me,

897
00:55:39,005 --> 00:55:40,806
you might have
had me there.

898
00:56:23,919 --> 00:56:26,955
Looks like your woman's
getting the better of you,

899
00:56:26,989 --> 00:56:29,024
if you can
call that a woman.

900
00:56:29,058 --> 00:56:31,126
We enjoy a good fight.

901
00:56:31,160 --> 00:56:33,428
Gets our juices flowing.

902
00:56:33,462 --> 00:56:36,331
The Flayed Man
of House Bolton.

903
00:56:36,399 --> 00:56:38,266
A bit gruesome
for my taste.

904
00:56:38,301 --> 00:56:42,004
- You sure he's the one?
- That's him, all right.

905
00:56:42,038 --> 00:56:43,838
I saw him fight
at the tourney

906
00:56:43,873 --> 00:56:45,840
for Ser Willem Frey's
wedding.

907
00:56:47,276 --> 00:56:50,078
Give the man his silver.

908
00:56:51,581 --> 00:56:53,848
Let us go and my father will pay
you whatever you want.

909
00:56:53,883 --> 00:56:56,151
Enough to buy me
a new head?

910
00:56:56,185 --> 00:56:59,554
<i>If the King in the North</i>
<i>hears I had the Kingslayer</i>

911
00:56:59,588 --> 00:57:02,457
and let him go,
he'll be taking it right off.

912
00:57:02,491 --> 00:57:04,626
I'd rather he takes yours.

913
00:57:17,965 --> 00:57:22,965
