1
00:00:01,205 --> 00:00:04,107
Is the Wall as big
as they say?

2
00:00:04,141 --> 00:00:05,174
Bigger.

3
00:00:05,208 --> 00:00:07,510
- How much longer?
- A few more days.

4
00:00:07,544 --> 00:00:10,012
I found something
at the Fist of the First Men.

5
00:00:10,047 --> 00:00:11,247
What does it do?

6
00:00:11,281 --> 00:00:13,749
I'm not sure
that it does anything.

7
00:00:13,784 --> 00:00:15,484
You're not supposed
to be here.

8
00:00:15,518 --> 00:00:17,219
- If your father knew--
- He said you're a traitor.

9
00:00:17,253 --> 00:00:18,420
I am, child.

10
00:00:18,454 --> 00:00:20,355
You must get bored
down here.

11
00:00:20,389 --> 00:00:21,689
I brought you
something to read.

12
00:00:21,724 --> 00:00:23,258
My lady, I can't
read the words.

13
00:00:23,293 --> 00:00:24,626
I wouldn't know
where to start.

14
00:00:24,661 --> 00:00:27,129
At the beginning.
This word is Aegon.

15
00:00:27,164 --> 00:00:29,666
The Yunkish train
bed slaves, not soldiers.

16
00:00:29,701 --> 00:00:32,402
- We can defeat them.
- But they won't meet us on the field.

17
00:00:32,437 --> 00:00:34,538
<i>They have strong walls.</i>

18
00:00:38,978 --> 00:00:41,280
Women in our position
must make the best

19
00:00:41,315 --> 00:00:42,782
of our circumstances.

20
00:00:42,816 --> 00:00:45,685
How do I make the best
of my circumstances?

21
00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:47,387
I have to marry him.

22
00:00:47,422 --> 00:00:48,956
I didn't ask
for this marriage.

23
00:00:48,990 --> 00:00:51,926
I will marry Sansa Stark
and do my duty by her.

24
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:55,096
My feelings for you
have not changed.

25
00:00:55,131 --> 00:00:57,099
Listen to me,
my lady.

26
00:00:57,133 --> 00:01:00,002
I'm not your lady.
I'm your whore.

27
00:01:01,104 --> 00:01:03,172
You will release
every slave in Yunkai.

28
00:01:03,206 --> 00:01:05,975
You are mad.
We have powerful friends.

29
00:01:06,010 --> 00:01:09,179
Friends who would take great
pleasure in destroying you.

30
00:01:09,214 --> 00:01:11,482
Perhaps we'll make
a slave of you as well.

31
00:01:13,785 --> 00:01:15,519
He said he had
powerful friends.

32
00:01:15,553 --> 00:01:16,820
Who was he talking about?

33
00:01:16,855 --> 00:01:19,156
- I don't know.
- Find out.

34
00:01:19,191 --> 00:01:21,592
Haven't you ever wondered
where your strength came from?

35
00:01:21,627 --> 00:01:24,262
- Your blood is noble.
- I'm just a bastard.

36
00:01:24,297 --> 00:01:26,765
The bastard of Robert
of the House Baratheon.

37
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:29,268
There is power
in a king's blood.

38
00:01:29,302 --> 00:01:30,335
You're a liar!

39
00:01:30,370 --> 00:01:32,004
You lied to Gendry,
you lied to me.

40
00:01:32,039 --> 00:01:33,339
Now--

41
00:01:33,373 --> 00:01:35,574
- Anguy, bring her back.
- Come back, girl!

42
00:01:40,748 --> 00:01:42,416
Kick all you like,
wolf girl.

43
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:44,852
Won't do you no good.

44
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:58,620
<font color=#00FF00>? Game of Thrones 3x08 ?</font>

== sync, corrected by <font color="#00ff00">elderman</font> ==

46
00:04:14,873 --> 00:04:17,508
I'll give you one try, girl.

47
00:04:20,078 --> 00:04:22,213
Kill me and you're free.

48
00:04:22,247 --> 00:04:25,983
But if I live,
I'll break both your hands.

49
00:04:28,186 --> 00:04:30,054
Go on, hit me.

50
00:04:30,088 --> 00:04:32,790
<i>Hit me hard.</i>

51
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:44,734
Sulk all you want.

52
00:04:44,769 --> 00:04:47,637
The truth is,
you're lucky.

53
00:04:48,873 --> 00:04:51,441
You don't want to be
alone out here, girl.

54
00:04:51,475 --> 00:04:54,076
Someone worse than me
would find you.

55
00:04:54,110 --> 00:04:56,045
There's no one
worse than you.

56
00:04:56,079 --> 00:04:58,280
Ha, you never knew
my brother.

57
00:04:58,314 --> 00:05:00,849
He once killed a man
for snoring.

58
00:05:00,884 --> 00:05:03,419
There's plenty
worse than me.

59
00:05:03,453 --> 00:05:05,954
There's men who like
to beat little girls,

60
00:05:05,989 --> 00:05:08,023
men who like
to rape them.

61
00:05:08,057 --> 00:05:10,159
I saved your sister
from some of them.

62
00:05:12,062 --> 00:05:13,462
You're lying.

63
00:05:13,497 --> 00:05:15,564
Ask her, if you
ever see her again.

64
00:05:15,599 --> 00:05:17,299
Ask her who
came back for her

65
00:05:17,334 --> 00:05:20,169
when the mob
had her on her back.

66
00:05:21,771 --> 00:05:23,606
They would have
taken her every which way

67
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:26,141
and left her there
with her throat cut open.

68
00:05:32,349 --> 00:05:33,850
Is that the Blackwater?

69
00:05:33,884 --> 00:05:36,319
The Blackwater?

70
00:05:36,353 --> 00:05:38,687
Where do you think
I'm taking you?

71
00:05:40,257 --> 00:05:43,426
Back to King's Landing
to Joffrey and the queen.

72
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:46,195
Fuck Joffrey.
Fuck the queen.

73
00:05:46,229 --> 00:05:48,131
That's the Red Fork.

74
00:05:48,165 --> 00:05:50,633
I'm taking you
to the Twins.

75
00:05:52,036 --> 00:05:53,870
But why?

76
00:05:53,905 --> 00:05:56,573
Because your mother
and brother will be there

77
00:05:56,607 --> 00:05:58,708
and they'll pay me for you.

78
00:06:00,645 --> 00:06:03,213
Why would they be
at the Twins?

79
00:06:03,248 --> 00:06:07,118
Those outlaws you love
so much never told you?

80
00:06:07,152 --> 00:06:09,787
The whole countryside
is yapping about it.

81
00:06:11,089 --> 00:06:14,325
Your uncle is marrying
one of the Frey girls.

82
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:16,360
So quit trying
to bash my skull in

83
00:06:16,395 --> 00:06:19,030
and we might just make it there
in time for the wedding.

84
00:06:36,914 --> 00:06:39,882
Men who fight for gold
have neither honor nor loyalty.

85
00:06:39,917 --> 00:06:41,484
<i>They cannot be trusted.</i>

86
00:06:41,518 --> 00:06:44,153
<i>They can be trusted to kill</i>
<i>you if they're well paid.</i>

87
00:06:44,188 --> 00:06:46,456
<i>The Yunkish</i>
<i>are paying them well.</i>

88
00:06:46,490 --> 00:06:48,224
You know these men?

89
00:06:48,258 --> 00:06:50,926
Only by the broken swords
on their banners.

90
00:06:50,961 --> 00:06:53,762
They're called
the Second Sons.

91
00:06:53,797 --> 00:06:56,698
A company led by
a Braavosi named Mero,

92
00:06:56,732 --> 00:06:59,367
"The Titan's Bastard."

93
00:06:59,401 --> 00:07:01,769
Is he more titan
or bastard?

94
00:07:01,804 --> 00:07:04,072
He's a dangerous man,
khaleesi.

95
00:07:04,106 --> 00:07:06,141
They all are.

96
00:07:08,044 --> 00:07:09,478
How many?

97
00:07:09,512 --> 00:07:12,081
<i>2,000, Your Grace.</i>

98
00:07:12,115 --> 00:07:13,783
<i>Armored and mounted.</i>

99
00:07:13,817 --> 00:07:16,019
Enough to make
a difference?

100
00:07:19,624 --> 00:07:22,658
It's hard to collect
wages from a corpse.

101
00:07:22,693 --> 00:07:25,495
I'm sure the sellswords
prefer to fight for the winning side.

102
00:07:25,529 --> 00:07:27,530
I imagine you're right.

103
00:07:27,564 --> 00:07:31,801
I'd like to talk to the
Titan's Bastard about winning.

104
00:07:31,869 --> 00:07:33,904
He may not agree
to meet.

105
00:07:33,938 --> 00:07:35,372
He will.

106
00:07:35,406 --> 00:07:39,109
A man who fights for gold can't
afford to lose to a girl.

107
00:07:39,143 --> 00:07:41,712
<i>Your Grace,</i>
<i>allow me to present</i>

108
00:07:41,746 --> 00:07:44,714
<i>the captains</i>
<i>of the Second Sons--</i>

109
00:07:44,749 --> 00:07:47,750
Mero of Braavos,

110
00:07:47,785 --> 00:07:50,853
Prendahl na Ghezn,

111
00:07:50,888 --> 00:07:52,322
and...

112
00:07:52,356 --> 00:07:54,857
Daario Naharis.

113
00:07:59,062 --> 00:08:01,096
You are the Mother
of Dragons?

114
00:08:02,599 --> 00:08:05,034
I swear I fucked you once
in a pleasure house in Lys.

115
00:08:05,068 --> 00:08:07,803
- Mind your tongue.
<i>- Why?</i>

116
00:08:07,838 --> 00:08:10,240
I didn't mind hers.

117
00:08:10,274 --> 00:08:13,176
She licked my ass
like she was born to do it.

118
00:08:15,981 --> 00:08:18,816
You, slave girl,
bring wine.

119
00:08:18,851 --> 00:08:21,152
We have no slaves here.

120
00:08:21,186 --> 00:08:23,187
You'll all be slaves
after the battle

121
00:08:23,221 --> 00:08:25,323
unless I save you.

122
00:08:27,192 --> 00:08:29,761
Take your clothes off
and come and sit on Mero's lap

123
00:08:29,795 --> 00:08:31,563
and I may give you
my Second Sons.

124
00:08:31,597 --> 00:08:34,466
Give me your Second Sons
and I may not have you gelded.

125
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:37,669
Ser Barristan, how many men
fight for the Second Sons?

126
00:08:37,703 --> 00:08:40,138
Under 2,000, Your Grace.

127
00:08:40,173 --> 00:08:41,840
We have more,
don't we?

128
00:08:41,875 --> 00:08:44,409
<i>10,000 Unsullied.</i>

129
00:08:44,444 --> 00:08:46,444
I'm only a young girl,
new to the ways of war,

130
00:08:46,479 --> 00:08:48,513
but perhaps a seasoned
captain like yourself

131
00:08:48,548 --> 00:08:51,984
can explain to me
how you propose to defeat us.

132
00:08:52,019 --> 00:08:54,853
I hope the old man is better with
a sword than he is with a lie.

133
00:08:54,888 --> 00:08:57,857
You have 8,000 Unsullied.

134
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:02,228
You're very young
to be a captain.

135
00:09:02,262 --> 00:09:04,864
He's not a captain.
He's a lieutenant.

136
00:09:04,898 --> 00:09:06,933
Even if your numbers
are right,

137
00:09:06,967 --> 00:09:09,268
you must admit the odds
don't favor your side.

138
00:09:09,303 --> 00:09:11,337
The Second Sons have faced
worse odds and won.

139
00:09:11,372 --> 00:09:14,106
The Second Sons have
faced worse odds and run.

140
00:09:15,742 --> 00:09:17,277
Or you could
fight for me.

141
00:09:20,214 --> 00:09:22,281
We've taken
the slavers' gold.

142
00:09:22,316 --> 00:09:24,050
We fight for Yunkai.

143
00:09:24,084 --> 00:09:27,353
<i>I would pay</i>
<i>you as much and more.</i>

144
00:09:28,655 --> 00:09:30,523
Our contract
is our bond.

145
00:09:30,590 --> 00:09:32,057
If we break our bond,

146
00:09:32,092 --> 00:09:34,260
no one will hire
the Second Sons again.

147
00:09:34,294 --> 00:09:37,530
Ride with me and you'll
never need another contract.

148
00:09:37,564 --> 00:09:40,966
You'll have gold and castles
and lordships of your choosing

149
00:09:41,001 --> 00:09:42,568
when I take back
the Seven Kingdoms.

150
00:09:42,602 --> 00:09:45,104
You have no ships.
You have no siege weapons.

151
00:09:45,138 --> 00:09:46,806
You have no cavalry.

152
00:09:46,873 --> 00:09:49,375
A fortnight ago,
I had no army.

153
00:09:49,409 --> 00:09:51,744
A year ago,
I had no dragons.

154
00:09:54,348 --> 00:09:56,348
You have two days
to decide.

155
00:09:59,319 --> 00:10:02,321
Show me your cunt. I want
to see if it's worth fighting for.

156
00:10:09,128 --> 00:10:10,895
You seem to be
enjoying my wine.

157
00:10:10,963 --> 00:10:13,431
Perhaps you'd like
a flagon to help you ponder.

158
00:10:13,465 --> 00:10:15,266
Only a flagon?

159
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:17,334
And what are my brothers
in arms to drink?

160
00:10:17,369 --> 00:10:20,003
- A barrel, then.
- Good.

161
00:10:20,037 --> 00:10:23,473
The Titan's Bastard
does not drink alone.

162
00:10:25,977 --> 00:10:28,179
In the Second Sons,
we share everything.

163
00:10:28,213 --> 00:10:30,614
After the battle,
maybe we'll all share you.

164
00:10:35,987 --> 00:10:38,222
I'll come looking for you
when this is over.

165
00:10:41,626 --> 00:10:43,527
Ser Barristan,

166
00:10:43,561 --> 00:10:47,498
if it comes to battle,
kill that one first.

167
00:10:47,532 --> 00:10:49,667
Gladly, Your Grace.

168
00:11:42,787 --> 00:11:45,189
Half Robert,
half lowborn.

169
00:11:47,125 --> 00:11:48,726
Show the boy
to his chambers.

170
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:52,030
<i>Have the maids draw him</i>
<i>a bath and find him some decent clothes.</i>

171
00:11:53,165 --> 00:11:55,233
I'll come visit you soon.

172
00:12:02,909 --> 00:12:04,743
What do you mean
to do with him?

173
00:12:04,778 --> 00:12:06,412
You know what I mean
to do with him.

174
00:12:06,446 --> 00:12:08,580
Then why bathe him
and dress him in fine clothes?

175
00:12:08,615 --> 00:12:11,283
If it needs to be done, do it.
Don't torture the boy.

176
00:12:11,318 --> 00:12:13,619
Have you ever slaughtered
a lamb, my king?

177
00:12:13,653 --> 00:12:15,487
No.

178
00:12:15,521 --> 00:12:18,590
If the lamb
sees the knife,

179
00:12:18,625 --> 00:12:20,692
she panics.

180
00:12:20,727 --> 00:12:22,861
Her panic seeps
into her meat,

181
00:12:22,895 --> 00:12:25,130
darkens it,
fouls the flavor.

182
00:12:25,164 --> 00:12:27,532
You've slaughtered
many lambs?

183
00:12:27,566 --> 00:12:30,635
And none have seen
the blade.

184
00:12:41,514 --> 00:12:43,815
"And tho-- and thowg...

185
00:12:44,850 --> 00:12:47,619

Vhag--"

190
00:12:59,232 --> 00:13:01,332
Fuck me.

191
00:13:03,302 --> 00:13:07,037
<i>"Visenya Targaryen</i>

enough-- enough

197
00:13:22,218 --> 00:13:26,222
to swallow
a horse whole."

198
00:13:38,969 --> 00:13:41,337
Your Grace.

199
00:13:41,372 --> 00:13:43,239
They feeding you enough?

200
00:13:43,274 --> 00:13:45,008
<i>Two meals a day.</i>

201
00:13:45,042 --> 00:13:47,343
Cold for breakfast,
hot for supper.

202
00:13:47,378 --> 00:13:49,178
I cannot complain.

203
00:13:50,381 --> 00:13:52,415
You don't belong
in a place like this.

204
00:13:52,449 --> 00:13:55,551
Well, it's sad to say,
but I've seen worse.

205
00:13:56,753 --> 00:13:58,187
Yeah.

206
00:14:01,258 --> 00:14:03,326
I'm sorry about your son.

207
00:14:04,562 --> 00:14:06,663
<i>Didn't get the chance</i>
<i>to tell you before.</i>

208
00:14:06,697 --> 00:14:09,900
Good lad.
Loyal lad.

209
00:14:13,304 --> 00:14:16,173
Melisandre's returned.

210
00:14:16,208 --> 00:14:18,476
I didn't know
she'd been gone.

211
00:14:18,511 --> 00:14:20,645
Came back
with a bastard boy.

212
00:14:22,414 --> 00:14:24,149
Robert's bastard boy.

213
00:14:24,183 --> 00:14:26,017
Why?

214
00:14:26,051 --> 00:14:28,853
She says there's power
in king's blood.

215
00:14:28,887 --> 00:14:31,956
She's going to kill him.

216
00:14:31,991 --> 00:14:33,324
Sacrifice him.

217
00:14:33,359 --> 00:14:34,893
Forgive me, Your Grace,
I'm not a learned man,

218
00:14:34,927 --> 00:14:38,162
but is there a difference
between kill and sacrifice?

219
00:14:38,197 --> 00:14:39,931
The boy is your nephew.

220
00:14:39,965 --> 00:14:42,433
What of it?
We're at war.

221
00:14:42,468 --> 00:14:45,370
Why should I spare the son
of some tavern slut

222
00:14:45,404 --> 00:14:48,373
Robert bedded
one drunken night?

223
00:14:48,407 --> 00:14:50,409
Because he has
your blood in his veins.

224
00:14:52,913 --> 00:14:55,348
So did Renly.

225
00:14:55,382 --> 00:14:57,617
Renly wronged you.

226
00:14:57,651 --> 00:15:00,387
Renly declared himself king when
the throne belonged to you.

227
00:15:00,421 --> 00:15:02,889
He raised an army,
stole your bannermen.

228
00:15:02,924 --> 00:15:05,092
This boy has
done you no harm.

229
00:15:05,126 --> 00:15:07,795
- He's an innocent.
- How many boys live in Westeros?

230
00:15:07,829 --> 00:15:11,399
How many girls?
How many men? How many women?

231
00:15:11,433 --> 00:15:13,667
The darkness will devour
them all, she says.

232
00:15:13,702 --> 00:15:15,603
The night that never ends.

233
00:15:15,638 --> 00:15:17,572
Unless I triumph.

234
00:15:17,606 --> 00:15:19,107
I never asked for this.

235
00:15:19,141 --> 00:15:20,842
No more than I asked
to be king.

236
00:15:20,876 --> 00:15:24,246
We do not choose
our destiny,

237
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:26,815
but we must do
our duty, no?

238
00:15:26,849 --> 00:15:29,584
Great or small,
we must do our duty.

239
00:15:31,287 --> 00:15:34,923
What's one bastard boy
against a kingdom?

240
00:15:38,061 --> 00:15:40,262
Your Grace,

241
00:15:40,296 --> 00:15:42,397
why did you come
to see me today?

242
00:15:42,431 --> 00:15:45,166
I came to free you.

243
00:15:45,201 --> 00:15:48,870
If you swear never to raise your
hand to the Lady Melisandre again.

244
00:15:48,905 --> 00:15:52,072
I swear it.

245
00:15:52,107 --> 00:15:54,375
I can't swear never
to speak against her.

246
00:15:54,409 --> 00:15:56,444
You have little regard
for your own life.

247
00:15:56,478 --> 00:15:58,546
Quite little, Your Grace.

248
00:15:58,581 --> 00:16:00,948
Verging on none.

249
00:16:00,982 --> 00:16:04,785
You could have freed me
yesterday or tomorrow,

250
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:07,455
but you came to me now
before this boy is put to the knife

251
00:16:07,489 --> 00:16:11,292
because you knew
I'd counsel restraint.

252
00:16:12,861 --> 00:16:15,629
You came to hear me say it
because you believe it yourself.

253
00:16:15,664 --> 00:16:18,098
You're not a man
who slaughters innocents

254
00:16:18,133 --> 00:16:20,534
for gain or glory.

255
00:16:24,506 --> 00:16:27,575
When my son was five
he said to me,

256
00:16:27,609 --> 00:16:30,077
"I don't ever
want to die."

257
00:16:30,111 --> 00:16:33,413
I wanted to say to him,
"You won't, child. You won't ever."

258
00:16:33,447 --> 00:16:38,384
<i>I hated the idea of him</i>
<i>lying awake in the dark, afraid.</i>

259
00:16:42,089 --> 00:16:44,090
I think mothers and fathers
made up the gods

260
00:16:44,124 --> 00:16:47,293
because they wanted their children
to sleep through the night.

261
00:16:48,795 --> 00:16:51,330
I saw a vision
in the flames.

262
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:56,435
A great battle
in the snow.

263
00:16:56,470 --> 00:16:58,271
I saw it.

264
00:17:00,975 --> 00:17:04,477
And you saw whatever
she gave birth to.

265
00:17:04,512 --> 00:17:08,315
<i>I never believed,</i>
<i>but when you see the truth,</i>

266
00:17:08,349 --> 00:17:10,884
when it's right there
in front of you

267
00:17:10,918 --> 00:17:13,486
as real as these iron bars,

268
00:17:13,521 --> 00:17:16,556
how can you deny
her god is real?

269
00:17:37,812 --> 00:17:40,047
Little dragon bitch.
She talks too much.

270
00:17:40,081 --> 00:17:41,782
You talk too much.

271
00:17:41,816 --> 00:17:44,385
She won't talk so much
when she's choking on my cock.

272
00:17:44,419 --> 00:17:47,087
8,000 Unsullied stand
between her and your cock.

273
00:17:47,122 --> 00:17:49,890
My cock will find a way.

274
00:17:49,925 --> 00:17:50,600
Tell him.

275
00:17:50,625 --> 00:17:52,889
Is there any place
that my cock can't reach?

276
00:17:52,994 --> 00:17:55,596
She'll tell me whatever
you pay her to tell me.

277
00:17:55,630 --> 00:17:58,932
Daario Naharis, the whore
who doesn't like whores.

278
00:17:58,967 --> 00:18:02,002
I like them very much.
I just refuse to pay them.

279
00:18:02,036 --> 00:18:05,005
And I'm no whore,
my friend.

280
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:07,341
She sells her sheath
and you sell your blade.

281
00:18:07,375 --> 00:18:09,843
- What's the difference?
- I fight for beauty.

282
00:18:09,878 --> 00:18:11,378
For beauty?

283
00:18:11,412 --> 00:18:12,979
We fight for gold.

284
00:18:13,014 --> 00:18:17,351
The gods gave men two gifts to
entertain ourselves before we die--

285
00:18:17,385 --> 00:18:20,287
the thrill of fucking a woman
who wants to be fucked

286
00:18:20,321 --> 00:18:23,657
and the thrill of killing
a man who wants to kill you.

287
00:18:23,691 --> 00:18:25,192
You'll die young.

288
00:18:25,226 --> 00:18:26,793
<i>What do we do</i>
<i>about the dragon girl?</i>

289
00:18:26,828 --> 00:18:29,663
We can't beat 8,000 Unsullied
on the battlefield.

290
00:18:29,697 --> 00:18:32,399
There won't be a battle. And we don't
have to deal with her eunuchs.

291
00:18:32,433 --> 00:18:33,934
We only have
to deal with her.

292
00:18:33,968 --> 00:18:36,536
- She's well guarded.
<i>- Tonight's a new moon.</i>

293
00:18:36,571 --> 00:18:40,173
One of us slips into her camp past
her Unsullied and her knights.

294
00:18:41,542 --> 00:18:43,844
Which one of us?

295
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:46,813
Close your eyes, love.

296
00:18:53,354 --> 00:18:55,388
Three coins.

297
00:18:55,423 --> 00:18:57,290
A coin from Meereen,

298
00:18:57,325 --> 00:18:59,559
a coin from Volantis,

299
00:18:59,593 --> 00:19:01,161
and a coin from Braavos.

300
00:19:01,195 --> 00:19:02,862
The Braavosi
does the deed.

301
00:19:07,401 --> 00:19:09,435
One for each
of us, darling.

302
00:19:10,538 --> 00:19:12,338
No peeking.

303
00:19:27,554 --> 00:19:29,889
Do you hear me?

304
00:19:29,923 --> 00:19:33,425
Follow my voice.
I'm right here.

305
00:19:34,561 --> 00:19:36,795
You have
something for me?

306
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:43,202
Valar morghulis.

307
00:20:05,192 --> 00:20:06,959
Lady Sansa.

308
00:20:08,395 --> 00:20:10,363
You look very handsome,
my lord.

309
00:20:10,397 --> 00:20:11,964
Oh, yes.

310
00:20:11,998 --> 00:20:14,400
The husband
of your dreams.

311
00:20:14,434 --> 00:20:17,069
But you do
look glorious.

312
00:20:22,075 --> 00:20:24,076
Perhaps we could have
a moment alone.

313
00:20:24,110 --> 00:20:25,745
Do you mind?

314
00:20:27,314 --> 00:20:30,950
Podrick, could you escort
Lady Stark's handmaiden?

315
00:20:46,502 --> 00:20:48,470
My lady,

316
00:20:48,505 --> 00:20:51,039
I want you to know

317
00:20:51,073 --> 00:20:53,408
I didn't ask for this.

318
00:20:53,442 --> 00:20:56,144
I hope I will not
disappoint you, my lord.

319
00:20:56,178 --> 00:20:57,879
No, don't.

320
00:20:57,913 --> 00:21:00,849
You don't have to speak to me
as a prisoner anymore.

321
00:21:00,883 --> 00:21:02,884
You won't be a prisoner
after today.

322
00:21:02,919 --> 00:21:04,987
You'll be my wife.

323
00:21:05,022 --> 00:21:09,392
I suppose that's a different
kind of prison.

324
00:21:11,162 --> 00:21:13,063
I just wanted to say--

325
00:21:13,098 --> 00:21:16,734
I'm just trying
to say very badly--

326
00:21:18,270 --> 00:21:20,638
I just--

327
00:21:20,672 --> 00:21:23,473
just want to say
I know how you feel.

328
00:21:25,509 --> 00:21:28,711
I doubt that
very much, my lord.

329
00:21:30,681 --> 00:21:32,181
You're right.

330
00:21:32,215 --> 00:21:34,550
I have no idea
how you feel.

331
00:21:34,584 --> 00:21:36,852
And you have no idea
how I feel.

332
00:21:43,993 --> 00:21:46,928
But I promise you
one thing, my lady.

333
00:21:48,231 --> 00:21:50,632
I won't ever hurt you.

334
00:21:54,504 --> 00:21:57,038
Do you drink wine?

335
00:21:57,073 --> 00:21:59,608
When I have to.

336
00:21:59,642 --> 00:22:02,878
Well, today you have to.

337
00:22:09,886 --> 00:22:12,154
<i>You look radiant,</i>
<i>Your Grace.</i>

338
00:22:12,188 --> 00:22:14,790
Radiant?
Why radiant?

339
00:22:14,824 --> 00:22:16,659
It's the word
that came to mind.

340
00:22:18,729 --> 00:22:20,730
We're going
to be sisters soon.

341
00:22:20,764 --> 00:22:23,166
We should be friends.

342
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:25,735
You're a musical girl,
aren't you?

343
00:22:25,770 --> 00:22:28,605
I imagine you have
a lovely voice.

344
00:22:28,639 --> 00:22:31,575
A better dancer
than a singer, I'm afraid.

345
00:22:31,609 --> 00:22:34,177
Ah, but you know the song
"The Rains of Castamere"?

346
00:22:34,212 --> 00:22:37,715
Of course. They play it
so often here at court.

347
00:22:37,749 --> 00:22:40,718
So you know the story
of House Reyne of Castamere?

348
00:22:40,752 --> 00:22:43,220
Not as well as you,
I'm sure.

349
00:22:43,254 --> 00:22:45,388
House Reyne
was a powerful family.

350
00:22:45,423 --> 00:22:46,823
Very wealthy.

351
00:22:46,857 --> 00:22:49,392
The second wealthiest
in Westeros.

352
00:22:49,426 --> 00:22:53,796
Aren't the Tyrells the second
wealthiest family in Westeros now?

353
00:22:53,831 --> 00:22:56,265
Of course, ambitious climbers
don't want to stop

354
00:22:56,299 --> 00:22:58,600
on the second highest rung.

355
00:22:58,634 --> 00:23:01,469
If only you could take
that final step,

356
00:23:01,504 --> 00:23:04,372
you'd see further
than all the rest.

357
00:23:04,407 --> 00:23:07,375
You'd be alone with nothing
but blue sky above you.

358
00:23:08,377 --> 00:23:10,345
So Lord Reyne
built a castle

359
00:23:10,379 --> 00:23:12,347
as grand as Casterly Rock.

360
00:23:12,381 --> 00:23:13,949
He gave his wife diamonds

361
00:23:13,983 --> 00:23:16,518
larger than any
my mother ever wore.

362
00:23:16,553 --> 00:23:18,887
And finally one day,

363
00:23:18,922 --> 00:23:21,256
he rebelled
against my father.

364
00:23:21,291 --> 00:23:23,959
Do you know where
House Reyne is now?

365
00:23:23,994 --> 00:23:25,527
Gone.

366
00:23:25,562 --> 00:23:27,829
Gone.

367
00:23:27,864 --> 00:23:30,099
A gentle word.

368
00:23:30,133 --> 00:23:32,634
Why not say slaughtered?

369
00:23:32,669 --> 00:23:35,537
Every man, woman,
and child

370
00:23:35,572 --> 00:23:38,040
put to the sword.

371
00:23:38,074 --> 00:23:40,109
I remember seeing
their bodies hanging

372
00:23:40,143 --> 00:23:42,778
high above the gates
of Casterly Rock.

373
00:23:42,812 --> 00:23:45,715
My father let them rot
up there all summer.

374
00:23:45,749 --> 00:23:48,150
It was a long summer.

375
00:23:48,184 --> 00:23:51,820
"And now the rains
weep o'er their halls,

376
00:23:51,854 --> 00:23:53,922
and not a soul to hear."

377
00:23:59,528 --> 00:24:01,129
If you ever
call me sister again,

378
00:24:01,163 --> 00:24:03,798
I'll have you strangled
in your sleep.

379
00:24:34,764 --> 00:24:37,231
What are you doing?

380
00:24:37,266 --> 00:24:39,000
Your father's gone.

381
00:24:39,034 --> 00:24:42,136
As the father
of the realm,

382
00:24:42,171 --> 00:24:45,573
it is my duty to give you away
to your husband.

383
00:26:08,226 --> 00:26:10,094
You may now
cloak the bride

384
00:26:10,129 --> 00:26:13,197
and bring her
under your protection.

385
00:26:42,096 --> 00:26:44,230
Could you...

386
00:26:50,505 --> 00:26:52,139
Thank you.

387
00:26:57,746 --> 00:27:00,115
Your Grace,
Your Grace,

388
00:27:00,149 --> 00:27:02,717
<i>my lords, my ladies,</i>

389
00:27:02,752 --> 00:27:05,921
<i>we stand here in the sight</i>
<i>of gods and men</i>

390
00:27:05,955 --> 00:27:09,357
<i>to witness the union</i>
<i>of man and wife.</i>

391
00:27:09,392 --> 00:27:13,261
<i>One flesh, one heart,</i>
<i>one soul,</i>

392
00:27:13,296 --> 00:27:16,198
now and forever.

393
00:27:33,081 --> 00:27:35,515
Have you ever
seen one like it?

394
00:27:35,549 --> 00:27:38,484
I've never seen anything
like any of this.

395
00:27:38,518 --> 00:27:40,185
Not in my life.

396
00:27:40,220 --> 00:27:41,954
It's shocking, isn't it,

397
00:27:41,988 --> 00:27:44,056
the first time
you encounter real wealth?

398
00:27:44,090 --> 00:27:48,026
When I was your age,
I lived on one bowl of stew a day.

399
00:27:48,061 --> 00:27:50,963
And stew
is a kind word for it.

400
00:27:52,332 --> 00:27:54,834
In Flea Bottom we called them
bowls of brown.

401
00:27:56,403 --> 00:27:58,938
We'd pretend that the meat
in them was chicken.

402
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:02,075
We knew
it wasn't chicken.

403
00:28:13,889 --> 00:28:16,824
Here, taste this.

404
00:28:16,859 --> 00:28:19,394
You think I'm trying
to poison you?

405
00:28:41,614 --> 00:28:43,082
That's good.

406
00:28:46,653 --> 00:28:48,287
That's really good.

407
00:28:48,321 --> 00:28:50,622
<i>Where do you think</i>
<i>it's from?</i>

408
00:28:50,657 --> 00:28:52,391
I couldn't even guess.

409
00:28:52,425 --> 00:28:54,159
Doesn't matter, does it?

410
00:28:54,194 --> 00:28:56,362
It's the real thing
or it's not.

411
00:28:56,396 --> 00:28:59,565
You only need a tongue
to tell the difference.

412
00:29:01,735 --> 00:29:03,936
Go on,
have some more.

413
00:29:08,708 --> 00:29:10,876
You still
don't trust it.

414
00:29:10,910 --> 00:29:12,478
You think this
is all a mistake

415
00:29:12,512 --> 00:29:15,214
and that you'll have to pay
somehow for every bite you take.

416
00:29:15,248 --> 00:29:17,583
That thought had
crossed my mind, yeah.

417
00:29:19,386 --> 00:29:21,720
There are no mistakes.

418
00:29:21,755 --> 00:29:23,689
Not for us.

419
00:29:24,858 --> 00:29:27,292
I'm a mistake.

420
00:29:27,327 --> 00:29:29,528
I'm only here because
my father grabbed my mother

421
00:29:29,562 --> 00:29:31,496
instead of the girl
next to her in the tavern.

422
00:29:31,531 --> 00:29:35,233
Your father chose your mother because
the Lord of Light willed it.

423
00:29:35,267 --> 00:29:38,036
He willed it so you
could be here right now

424
00:29:38,070 --> 00:29:40,304
with a power inside you

425
00:29:40,339 --> 00:29:43,340
you can't even begin
to understand.

426
00:29:45,644 --> 00:29:48,446
And He brought me here
to draw it from you

427
00:29:48,481 --> 00:29:50,448
and birth it
into the world.

428
00:29:53,419 --> 00:29:55,686
We're both a part
of His plan.

429
00:29:56,688 --> 00:29:58,355
He wants this for us.

430
00:29:58,390 --> 00:30:01,225
No, He demands
this of us.

431
00:30:05,030 --> 00:30:07,565
I don't understand.
This--

432
00:30:07,599 --> 00:30:09,400
this doesn't seem
very religious.

433
00:30:09,434 --> 00:30:11,902
According to whom?

434
00:30:13,504 --> 00:30:15,372
The Silent Sisters?

435
00:30:15,406 --> 00:30:17,340
With their stern looks,

436
00:30:17,375 --> 00:30:20,677
muzzled mouths,
and dried-up cunts?

437
00:30:22,146 --> 00:30:24,647
What have their gods
done for you?

438
00:30:24,682 --> 00:30:26,682
Hmm?

439
00:30:26,717 --> 00:30:28,451
When you pray to them,

440
00:30:28,485 --> 00:30:30,719
what's their answer?

441
00:30:30,754 --> 00:30:33,322
A god is real
or he's not.

442
00:30:34,557 --> 00:30:37,192
You only need eyes
to see.

443
00:30:41,563 --> 00:30:44,866
Death is coming
for everyone and everything.

444
00:30:44,900 --> 00:30:47,869
A darkness that will
swallow the dawn.

445
00:30:48,938 --> 00:30:52,741
And we can stop it,
you and I.

446
00:31:19,469 --> 00:31:23,038
Let me show you
what you have inside you.

447
00:31:23,073 --> 00:31:25,107
Come fight death with me.

448
00:31:54,773 --> 00:31:56,540
What are you doing?

449
00:31:59,611 --> 00:32:01,645
You have to trust me.

450
00:32:24,735 --> 00:32:26,370
What--?

451
00:32:26,404 --> 00:32:28,806
Get it away.

452
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:30,207
Get it off me.

453
00:32:30,242 --> 00:32:33,010
Don't fight, don't fight.
They won't take much.

454
00:32:34,079 --> 00:32:36,047
Why are you
doing this?

455
00:32:37,283 --> 00:32:40,051
I told you there's power
in the blood of kings.

456
00:32:40,086 --> 00:32:42,054
And you have so much blood.

457
00:32:42,088 --> 00:32:45,123
No. No, no, no, no!

458
00:32:46,926 --> 00:32:49,328
Not there.
Not there!

459
00:32:54,567 --> 00:32:56,968
You can blame Ser Davos.

460
00:32:57,003 --> 00:32:59,637
He didn't believe in
the power of king's blood.

461
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:03,908
He wanted a demonstration.

462
00:33:03,943 --> 00:33:07,112
<i>Please.</i>
<i>Please, Your Grace.</i>

463
00:33:07,146 --> 00:33:09,615
<i>My lord!</i>

464
00:33:45,250 --> 00:33:47,718
The usurper Robb Stark.

465
00:33:50,922 --> 00:33:53,424
The usurper Balon Greyjoy.

466
00:33:57,630 --> 00:34:00,131
The usurper
Joffrey Baratheon.

467
00:34:17,815 --> 00:34:21,951
So their son
will be your nephew.

468
00:34:21,985 --> 00:34:24,587
After you're wed
to Cersei, of course.

469
00:34:25,823 --> 00:34:28,926
And you will be
the king's stepfather

470
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:31,262
and brother-in-law.

471
00:34:31,296 --> 00:34:33,163
When you marry the king,

472
00:34:33,198 --> 00:34:37,067
<i>Joffrey's mother will</i>
<i>become his sister-in-law</i>

473
00:34:37,102 --> 00:34:41,171
<i>and your son</i>
<i>will be Loras' nephew?</i>

474
00:34:41,206 --> 00:34:44,941
Grandson?
I'm not sure.

475
00:34:44,976 --> 00:34:47,511
But your brother will become
your father-in-law.

476
00:34:47,546 --> 00:34:49,780
That much
is beyond dispute.

477
00:35:10,467 --> 00:35:12,802
Will you pardon me,
my lord?

478
00:35:13,904 --> 00:35:16,539
Of course. Of course.
En-- enjoy.

479
00:35:20,343 --> 00:35:24,179
Perhaps you could talk
to your bride-to-be instead.

480
00:35:27,116 --> 00:35:29,317
I've got a lifetime for that.

481
00:35:40,663 --> 00:35:42,531
Stay.

482
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:53,375
You seem rather drunk.

483
00:35:53,410 --> 00:35:56,212
Rather less
than I plan to be.

484
00:35:56,246 --> 00:35:59,115
Isn't it a man's duty to be
drunk at his own wedding?

485
00:35:59,149 --> 00:36:00,716
This isn't about
your wedding.

486
00:36:00,751 --> 00:36:03,052
Renly Baratheon
had a wedding.

487
00:36:03,086 --> 00:36:05,355
Your wife needs a child,

488
00:36:05,389 --> 00:36:08,391
a Lannister child,
as soon as possible.

489
00:36:08,426 --> 00:36:11,228
- And?
- If you're going to give her one,

490
00:36:11,262 --> 00:36:13,263
you need to perform.

491
00:36:13,297 --> 00:36:16,166
What did you once call me?

492
00:36:16,201 --> 00:36:18,669
A drunken little
lust-filled beast.

493
00:36:18,703 --> 00:36:21,272
- More than once.
- <i>There you have it.</i>

494
00:36:21,306 --> 00:36:23,374
Nothing to worry about.

495
00:36:23,408 --> 00:36:25,709
Drinking and lust,

496
00:36:25,744 --> 00:36:28,378
no man can match me
in these things.

497
00:36:28,413 --> 00:36:31,681
I am the god
of tits and wine.

498
00:36:31,716 --> 00:36:35,151
I shall build
a shrine to myself

499
00:36:35,185 --> 00:36:37,086
at the next brothel
I visit.

500
00:36:38,121 --> 00:36:40,523
You can drink,
you can joke,

501
00:36:40,557 --> 00:36:42,958
you can engage
in juvenile attempts

502
00:36:42,992 --> 00:36:44,760
to make your father
uncomfortable,

503
00:36:44,794 --> 00:36:47,596
but you will do your duty.

504
00:37:26,805 --> 00:37:28,138
Well...

505
00:37:33,011 --> 00:37:34,112
My father once told me--

506
00:37:34,146 --> 00:37:37,382
Nobody cares what
your father once told you.

507
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:01,975
Congratulations,
my lady.

508
00:38:02,009 --> 00:38:03,443
Thank you,
Your Grace.

509
00:38:03,477 --> 00:38:06,079
Well, you've done it.
You've married a Lannister.

510
00:38:06,113 --> 00:38:08,014
Soon you'll have
a Lannister baby.

511
00:38:08,049 --> 00:38:11,251
It's a dream come true
for you, isn't it?

512
00:38:11,285 --> 00:38:13,153
What a glorious day.

513
00:38:13,187 --> 00:38:14,654
Yes, Your Grace.

514
00:38:14,689 --> 00:38:17,090
I suppose it doesn't
really matter

515
00:38:17,124 --> 00:38:19,626
which Lannister
puts the baby into you.

516
00:38:20,761 --> 00:38:22,729
Maybe I'll pay you
a visit tonight

517
00:38:22,763 --> 00:38:25,198
after my uncle
passes out.

518
00:38:25,232 --> 00:38:27,100
How'd you like that?

519
00:38:29,436 --> 00:38:31,171
You wouldn't?

520
00:38:31,205 --> 00:38:34,207
That's all right. Ser Meryn and
Ser Boros will hold you down.

521
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:40,514
Time for the bedding
ceremony.

522
00:38:41,783 --> 00:38:43,551
There will be
no bedding ceremony.

523
00:38:43,585 --> 00:38:46,386
Where's your respect
for tradition, Uncle?

524
00:38:46,421 --> 00:38:47,921
Come, everyone.

525
00:38:47,956 --> 00:38:50,224
Pick her up and carry her
to her wedding bed.

526
00:38:50,259 --> 00:38:53,994
Get rid of her gown. She won't
be needing it any longer.

527
00:38:54,029 --> 00:38:56,931
Ladies, attend to my uncle.
He's not heavy.

528
00:38:56,965 --> 00:38:58,799
There will be
no bedding ceremony.

529
00:38:58,833 --> 00:39:02,036
There will be
if I command it.

530
00:39:03,839 --> 00:39:06,775
Then you'll be fucking
your own bride

531
00:39:06,809 --> 00:39:09,912
with a wooden cock.

532
00:39:11,547 --> 00:39:13,882
What did you say?

533
00:39:17,420 --> 00:39:22,124
What did you say?!

534
00:39:22,158 --> 00:39:25,794
I believe we can dispense
with the bedding, Your Grace.

535
00:39:27,196 --> 00:39:30,298
<i>I'm sure Tyrion did not mean</i>
<i>to threaten the king.</i>

536
00:39:38,006 --> 00:39:40,340
A bad joke, Your Grace.

537
00:39:40,375 --> 00:39:43,944
Made out of envy
of your own royal manhood.

538
00:39:45,380 --> 00:39:47,848
Mine is so small.

539
00:39:47,882 --> 00:39:50,718
My poor wife won't
even know I'm there.

540
00:39:50,752 --> 00:39:54,088
Your uncle is clearly
quite drunk, Your Grace.

541
00:39:54,122 --> 00:39:56,524
<i>I am.</i>

542
00:39:56,558 --> 00:39:58,759
Guilty.

543
00:39:59,861 --> 00:40:01,662
But--

544
00:40:03,498 --> 00:40:05,599
but it is my wedding night.

545
00:40:05,634 --> 00:40:09,804
My tiny drunk cock
and I have a job to do.

546
00:40:12,574 --> 00:40:14,241
Come, wife.

547
00:40:17,779 --> 00:40:20,080
I vomited on a girl once

548
00:40:20,114 --> 00:40:21,582
in the middle of the act.

549
00:40:21,616 --> 00:40:23,250
Not proud of it.

550
00:40:23,285 --> 00:40:26,187
But I think honesty
is important

551
00:40:26,222 --> 00:40:28,757
between a man and wife,
don't you agree?

552
00:40:28,791 --> 00:40:31,260
Come, I'll tell you
all about it.

553
00:40:31,294 --> 00:40:33,329
Put you in the mood.

554
00:41:05,696 --> 00:41:07,530
Is that wise,
my lord?

555
00:41:07,564 --> 00:41:10,332
Tyrion, Sansa.

556
00:41:10,367 --> 00:41:12,434
My name is Tyrion.

557
00:41:13,469 --> 00:41:15,437
Is that wise, Tyrion?

558
00:41:20,409 --> 00:41:22,677
Nothing was ever wiser.

559
00:41:34,222 --> 00:41:37,090
Astoundingly long.

560
00:41:37,958 --> 00:41:39,158
What?

561
00:41:39,193 --> 00:41:40,960
Neck.

562
00:41:40,994 --> 00:41:42,795
You have one.

563
00:41:45,599 --> 00:41:47,467
How old are you exactly?

564
00:41:47,501 --> 00:41:49,736
14.

565
00:41:53,174 --> 00:41:57,744
Well, talk won't
make you any older.

566
00:42:04,819 --> 00:42:08,489
My lord father
has commanded me

567
00:42:08,524 --> 00:42:11,092
to consummate this marriage.

568
00:43:29,175 --> 00:43:31,476
Stop.

569
00:43:32,912 --> 00:43:34,913
I can't.

570
00:43:38,084 --> 00:43:40,519
I could, I won't.

571
00:43:40,554 --> 00:43:41,954
But your father--

572
00:43:41,988 --> 00:43:44,556
If my father wants
someone to get fucked,

573
00:43:44,590 --> 00:43:46,791
I know where he can start.

574
00:43:51,963 --> 00:43:53,864
I won't share your bed.

575
00:43:57,168 --> 00:43:59,536
Not until you want me to.

576
00:44:01,973 --> 00:44:04,875
What if I never
want you to?

577
00:44:15,554 --> 00:44:18,055
And so my watch begins.

578
00:45:12,210 --> 00:45:13,643
19?

579
00:45:13,678 --> 00:45:14,945
Yes, Your Grace.

580
00:45:14,979 --> 00:45:17,914
How can anyone
speak 19 languages?

581
00:45:17,949 --> 00:45:21,284
It only took Your Grace a year to
learn Dothraki reasonably well.

582
00:45:21,319 --> 00:45:23,520
Yes, well, it was
either learn Dothraki

583
00:45:23,554 --> 00:45:26,590
or grunt at my husband
and hope--

584
00:45:27,959 --> 00:45:30,161
what do you mean
reasonably well?

585
00:45:31,597 --> 00:45:34,566
Dothraki is difficult
for the mouth to master.

586
00:45:34,600 --> 00:45:36,701
So guttural and harsh.

587
00:45:45,311 --> 00:45:48,212
<i>Athjahakar.</i>

588
00:45:48,247 --> 00:45:50,782
Athjahaka.

589
00:45:50,816 --> 00:45:53,217
Ath-ja-hakar.

590
00:45:53,252 --> 00:45:55,919
Athjahakar.

591
00:45:57,121 --> 00:46:00,724
Well, I suppose
I'm a bit out of practice.

592
00:46:00,758 --> 00:46:04,027
Your High Valyrian
is very good, Your Grace.

593
00:46:04,062 --> 00:46:07,497
The gods could not devise
a more perfect tongue.

594
00:46:07,532 --> 00:46:10,434
<i>It is the only proper</i>
<i>language for poetry.</i>

595
00:46:16,007 --> 00:46:18,809
No screaming or she dies.

596
00:46:32,224 --> 00:46:33,524
What do you want?

597
00:46:35,026 --> 00:46:36,594
You.

598
00:46:36,628 --> 00:46:38,162
Let her go.

599
00:46:38,197 --> 00:46:40,431
Don't scream,
lovely girl.

600
00:46:47,705 --> 00:46:49,539
You were sent here
to kill me?

601
00:46:51,308 --> 00:46:53,409
So why haven't you?

602
00:46:53,444 --> 00:46:54,944
I don't want to.

603
00:46:54,978 --> 00:46:57,946
What do your captains
have to say about that?

604
00:46:57,981 --> 00:47:00,215
You should ask them.

605
00:47:05,554 --> 00:47:06,855
Why?

606
00:47:06,889 --> 00:47:09,624
We had philosophical
differences.

607
00:47:09,659 --> 00:47:12,027
- Over what?
- Your beauty.

608
00:47:12,061 --> 00:47:14,997
<i>It meant more to me</i>
<i>than it did to them.</i>

609
00:47:15,031 --> 00:47:16,999
You're a strange man.

610
00:47:17,033 --> 00:47:19,034
I'm the simplest man
you'll ever meet.

611
00:47:19,069 --> 00:47:20,569
I only do
what I want to do.

612
00:47:20,604 --> 00:47:22,505
And this is supposed
to impress me?

613
00:47:22,539 --> 00:47:24,840
Yes.

614
00:47:26,476 --> 00:47:29,412
Why would I trust a man
who murders his comrades?

615
00:47:29,446 --> 00:47:31,848
They ordered me
to murder you.

616
00:47:31,882 --> 00:47:34,050
<i>I told them</i>
<i>I preferred not to.</i>

617
00:47:34,084 --> 00:47:36,452
<i>They told me</i>
<i>I had no choice.</i>

618
00:47:36,487 --> 00:47:38,555
I told them
I am Daario Naharis.

619
00:47:38,589 --> 00:47:41,424
I always have a choice.

620
00:47:42,627 --> 00:47:45,329
They drew their swords

621
00:47:45,363 --> 00:47:47,464
and I drew mine.

622
00:48:18,595 --> 00:48:21,063
Will you fight for me?

623
00:48:27,405 --> 00:48:29,840
Swear to me.

624
00:48:32,577 --> 00:48:35,580
The Second Sons are yours
and so is Daario Naharis.

625
00:48:35,614 --> 00:48:38,450
My sword is yours,
my life is yours,

626
00:48:38,484 --> 00:48:40,953
my heart is yours.

627
00:48:58,806 --> 00:49:01,574
You really
ought to knock.

628
00:49:01,609 --> 00:49:03,877
I brought your breakfast.

629
00:50:21,353 --> 00:50:23,420
It's getting dark.

630
00:50:23,455 --> 00:50:25,622
We could stay here
for the night.

631
00:50:58,760 --> 00:51:01,162
How hard can it be
to build a fire?

632
00:51:01,196 --> 00:51:03,564
It doesn't matter.

633
00:51:03,599 --> 00:51:06,033
Come under the furs.
We can keep each other warm.

634
00:51:25,987 --> 00:51:27,821
He winked at me before.

635
00:51:28,923 --> 00:51:32,659
- I doubt it.
- I saw him wink at me.

636
00:51:32,693 --> 00:51:35,061
He blinked.

637
00:51:35,095 --> 00:51:37,897
I suppose it's a rather
philosophical difference

638
00:51:37,931 --> 00:51:40,032
between a wink
and a blink.

639
00:51:40,900 --> 00:51:42,568
A what?

640
00:51:43,970 --> 00:51:48,207
Well, I mean,
there's no real difference.

641
00:51:50,844 --> 00:51:53,279
A wink is on purpose.

642
00:51:56,317 --> 00:51:57,951
You thought of a name yet?

643
00:52:01,288 --> 00:52:04,825
It would be easier to refer
to him if he had a name.

644
00:52:04,859 --> 00:52:08,028
Sometimes do you talk fancy
on purpose to confuse me?

645
00:52:08,062 --> 00:52:10,731
What? No.

646
00:52:10,765 --> 00:52:13,468
This is just
the way I talk.

647
00:52:16,672 --> 00:52:18,807
I'll build that fire.

648
00:52:27,183 --> 00:52:29,584
Don't you think
he should have a name?

649
00:52:30,820 --> 00:52:33,889
I don't know
many boys' names.

650
00:52:33,923 --> 00:52:35,490
Let's see,

651
00:52:35,524 --> 00:52:37,659
there's Duncan,

652
00:52:37,693 --> 00:52:40,662
Kevan, Jon...

653
00:52:40,696 --> 00:52:42,597
Guymon,

654
00:52:42,631 --> 00:52:44,865
Feldan,
Tristifer.

655
00:52:44,900 --> 00:52:47,601
Craster.

656
00:52:47,635 --> 00:52:49,536
Uh, yes.

657
00:52:50,905 --> 00:52:52,372
Maybe that's not--

658
00:52:52,406 --> 00:52:54,407
Mormont.

659
00:52:54,441 --> 00:52:56,876
That's a lovely idea,

660
00:52:56,910 --> 00:52:58,844
but Mormont's a last name.

661
00:52:58,879 --> 00:53:01,780
Why is it a last name?

662
00:53:01,815 --> 00:53:04,517
Well, it's a family name.

663
00:53:06,386 --> 00:53:09,188
For instance,
I'm Samwell Tarly.

664
00:53:09,222 --> 00:53:11,491
Samwell is my birth name

665
00:53:11,525 --> 00:53:14,894
and Tarly
is my family name.

666
00:53:14,929 --> 00:53:19,398
You see?
So my father is also a Tarly.

667
00:53:20,701 --> 00:53:23,002
His name
is Samwell Tarly, too?

668
00:53:23,037 --> 00:53:25,939
No, Randyll Tarly.

669
00:53:25,973 --> 00:53:28,008
Randyll is a handsome name.

670
00:53:29,210 --> 00:53:31,045
Please don't
name him Randyll.

671
00:53:35,250 --> 00:53:37,184
Is your father
cruel like mine?

672
00:53:41,758 --> 00:53:44,159
Different manner of cruel.

673
00:53:57,040 --> 00:53:58,707
Not Randyll, then.

674
00:54:21,798 --> 00:54:23,933
Don't.

675
00:54:23,967 --> 00:54:25,768
Don't go out there.

676
00:54:25,802 --> 00:54:27,736
I'll be back.

677
00:54:27,771 --> 00:54:29,772
I just want to look.

678
00:55:05,074 --> 00:55:07,275
Go inside.

679
00:55:07,309 --> 00:55:09,644
Go back inside.
I'll--

680
00:55:23,393 --> 00:55:26,094
It's come for the baby.

681
00:55:41,277 --> 00:55:42,511
Stay back!

682
00:55:49,952 --> 00:55:51,753
You stay back!

683
00:56:04,266 --> 00:56:06,500
No, you can't
have him! No!

684
00:56:08,870 --> 00:56:10,704
No!

685
