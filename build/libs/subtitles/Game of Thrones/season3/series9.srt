1
00:00:01,127 --> 00:00:03,695
<i>You think I can't hear you</i>
<i>every day talking about visions</i>

2
00:00:03,729 --> 00:00:05,663
<i>and three-eyed ravens</i>
<i>and black magic?</i>

3
00:00:05,697 --> 00:00:07,998
I don't want you talking to him till
we get to Castle Black.

4
00:00:08,033 --> 00:00:10,701
We're not going to Castle Black.
Jon Snow isn't there.

5
00:00:10,736 --> 00:00:12,496
Bran needs to find
the raven beyond the Wall.

6
00:00:12,504 --> 00:00:14,172
Oh, no, I'm not
going back there.

7
00:00:14,207 --> 00:00:17,342
I promised your maester I'd get you
to Castle Black and no further.

8
00:00:17,376 --> 00:00:19,945
You won't win. You don't
have the discipline.

9
00:00:19,979 --> 00:00:22,114
- You don't know how to fight together.
- You don't know that.

10
00:00:22,148 --> 00:00:24,817
If you attack the Wall
you'll die, all of you.

11
00:00:24,851 --> 00:00:26,585
All of <i>us.</i>

12
00:00:26,620 --> 00:00:29,055
I can't force them
to meet us in the field.

13
00:00:29,089 --> 00:00:32,525
- Casterly Rock can't run away.
- Can you do it?

14
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:34,394
There is only one person
in this kingdom

15
00:00:34,429 --> 00:00:36,964
with that kind of army.
Walder Frey.

16
00:00:36,998 --> 00:00:39,867
We will do whatever we can to
give Lord Frey what he needs.

17
00:00:39,901 --> 00:00:43,370
Our father requires Lord Edmure
to wed one of his daughters.

18
00:00:43,404 --> 00:00:46,073
- You were sent here to kill me?
- I don't want to.

19
00:00:46,107 --> 00:00:48,108
What do your captains
have to say about that?

20
00:00:49,510 --> 00:00:50,778
<i>You should ask them.</i>

21
00:00:50,812 --> 00:00:53,147
Will you fight for me?

22
00:00:53,181 --> 00:00:56,217
The Second Sons are yours
and so is Daario Naharis.

23
00:00:56,251 --> 00:00:58,286
My sword is yours,
my life is yours,

24
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:00,054
my heart is yours.

25
00:01:00,089 --> 00:01:03,625
- Is that the Blackwater?
- Where do you think I'm taking you?

26
00:01:03,659 --> 00:01:06,194
- Back to King's Landing.
- That's the Red Fork.

27
00:01:06,229 --> 00:01:07,729
I'm taking you
to the Twins.

28
00:01:07,764 --> 00:01:10,398
Your uncle's marrying
one of the Frey girls.

29
00:01:10,433 --> 00:01:12,567
Your mother and brother
will be there

30
00:01:12,602 --> 00:01:14,536
and they'll pay me for you.

31
00:01:14,571 --> 00:01:16,839
That rain will cost
us another day.

32
00:01:16,873 --> 00:01:19,475
Lord Frey will take
this delay as a slight.

33
00:01:19,509 --> 00:01:22,144
- He's getting the wedding he wanted.
- He's getting a wedding.

34
00:01:22,179 --> 00:01:24,147
<i>It was a king he wanted.</i>

35
00:01:25,149 --> 00:01:26,582
It's come for the baby.

36
00:01:26,617 --> 00:01:27,884
You stay back!

37
00:01:29,954 --> 00:01:32,455
No, you can't have him.

38
00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:34,224
<i>No!</i>

41
00:02:03,353 --> 00:03:31,861

42
00:03:49,529 --> 00:03:52,831
<i>Are you sure about this?</i>

43
00:03:52,866 --> 00:03:55,534
No.

44
00:03:55,568 --> 00:03:57,603
It's dangerous.

45
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:02,207
If we take Tywin's
castle from him,

46
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:05,510
the lords of Westeros will
realize he's not invincible.

47
00:04:05,578 --> 00:04:07,012
Take his home,

48
00:04:07,113 --> 00:04:09,147
take his gold,
take his power.

49
00:04:09,182 --> 00:04:11,283
Why are you telling me?

50
00:04:14,987 --> 00:04:16,821
You begged me
not to send Theon

51
00:04:16,856 --> 00:04:20,759
to negotiate with his father
and I ignored your advice.

52
00:04:22,962 --> 00:04:25,097
Now Winterfell is burnt
to the ground,

53
00:04:25,131 --> 00:04:27,299
the North is overrun
with ironborn,

54
00:04:27,333 --> 00:04:29,401
and Bran and Rickon
are gone.

55
00:04:31,904 --> 00:04:33,805
So Casterly Rock...

56
00:04:38,277 --> 00:04:40,111
I'm asking your advice.

57
00:04:46,152 --> 00:04:48,386
We have enough men?

58
00:04:52,091 --> 00:04:54,226
If Walder Frey cooperates.

59
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:57,229
If Walder Frey
cooperates.

60
00:05:02,101 --> 00:05:05,437
If reinforcements arrive
from King's Landing

61
00:05:05,471 --> 00:05:07,839
<i>before we take</i>
<i>the castle...</i>

62
00:05:09,208 --> 00:05:13,044
we'll be caught between
Tywin's army and the sea.

63
00:05:17,315 --> 00:05:20,817
We'll lose the war and die
the way Father died.

64
00:05:20,851 --> 00:05:22,852
Or worse.

65
00:05:27,824 --> 00:05:31,694
Show them how it feels
to lose what they love.

66
00:06:01,991 --> 00:06:04,493
<i>My honored guests...</i>

67
00:06:06,062 --> 00:06:08,564
be welcome
within my walls

68
00:06:08,598 --> 00:06:10,399
and at my table.

69
00:06:12,436 --> 00:06:15,104
<i>I extend to you</i>
<i>my hospitality</i>

70
00:06:15,139 --> 00:06:18,975
and protection
in the light of the Seven.

71
00:06:19,009 --> 00:06:21,645
We thank you for your
hospitality, my lord.

72
00:06:25,616 --> 00:06:28,485
I have come to make
my apologies, my lord,

73
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:30,387
and to beg
your forgiveness.

74
00:06:30,421 --> 00:06:33,790
Don't beg my forgiveness,
Your Grace.

75
00:06:35,193 --> 00:06:38,328
It wasn't me you spurned.
It was my girls.

76
00:06:50,341 --> 00:06:53,510
<i>One of them was supposed</i>
<i>to be queen.</i>

77
00:06:53,544 --> 00:06:55,211
Now none of them are.

78
00:06:56,347 --> 00:06:59,782
This is Arwyen
my daughter.

79
00:06:59,817 --> 00:07:04,420
<i>My daughter Walda,</i>
<i>my daughter Derwa,</i>

80
00:07:04,454 --> 00:07:07,022
<i>my daughter Waldra.</i>

81
00:07:11,527 --> 00:07:13,762
My eldest granddaughters

82
00:07:13,797 --> 00:07:17,098
<i>Ginia and Neila.</i>

83
00:07:18,735 --> 00:07:23,172
<i>Serra and Sarra,</i>
<i>granddaughters, twins.</i>

84
00:07:23,206 --> 00:07:24,773
You could have
had either.

85
00:07:24,807 --> 00:07:28,077
<i>Could have had both</i>
<i>for all I care.</i>

86
00:07:28,111 --> 00:07:30,545
My granddaughter
Marianne.

87
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:33,448
<i>My granddaughter Freya.</i>

88
00:07:34,884 --> 00:07:37,285
My granddaughter...

89
00:07:37,319 --> 00:07:38,920
Wertha.

90
00:07:41,156 --> 00:07:44,224
<i>Waldra.</i>

91
00:07:44,292 --> 00:07:46,260
Waldina.

92
00:07:46,328 --> 00:07:49,096
- I'm Merry.
- Fine.

93
00:07:49,130 --> 00:07:52,900
And here's my youngest
daughter Shirei,

94
00:07:52,935 --> 00:07:55,871
<i>though she hasn't</i>
<i>bled yet.</i>

95
00:07:55,905 --> 00:07:58,774
Clearly you don't have
the patience for all that.

96
00:08:00,143 --> 00:08:01,777
My ladies.

97
00:08:01,811 --> 00:08:05,314
All men should keep their
word, kings most of all.

98
00:08:06,916 --> 00:08:09,885
I was pledged to marry one
of you and I broke that vow.

99
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:12,087
<i>The fault</i>
<i>is not with you.</i>

100
00:08:12,155 --> 00:08:15,524
<i>Any man would be lucky</i>
<i>to have any one of you.</i>

101
00:08:15,558 --> 00:08:18,460
<i>I did what I did</i>
<i>not to slight you,</i>

102
00:08:18,494 --> 00:08:20,329
but because I loved another.

103
00:08:20,363 --> 00:08:22,264
<i>I know these words</i>
<i>cannot set right</i>

104
00:08:22,298 --> 00:08:24,332
<i>the wrong I have done</i>
<i>to you and your house.</i>

105
00:08:24,367 --> 00:08:27,669
I beg your forgiveness

106
00:08:27,703 --> 00:08:30,805
and pledge to do
all I can to make amends

107
00:08:30,873 --> 00:08:33,675
so the Freys of the Crossing
and the Starks of Winterfell

108
00:08:33,743 --> 00:08:35,643
may once again be friends.

109
00:08:42,985 --> 00:08:44,853
<i>Very good.</i>

110
00:08:47,123 --> 00:08:48,990
There she is.

111
00:08:49,025 --> 00:08:51,159
<i>Come closer.</i>

112
00:08:51,193 --> 00:08:53,160
Let me have a look at you.

113
00:08:59,701 --> 00:09:02,302
Still can't see you.

114
00:09:02,336 --> 00:09:04,471
Old eyes.

115
00:09:19,188 --> 00:09:21,356
Love.

116
00:09:21,390 --> 00:09:25,261
<i>That's what the Starks</i>
<i>of Winterfell call it, eh?</i>

117
00:09:27,364 --> 00:09:29,398
Very honorable.

118
00:09:29,432 --> 00:09:31,700
I call it a pretty face.

119
00:09:31,735 --> 00:09:34,804
Mmm, very pretty.

120
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:39,008
Prettier than this lot,
that's for sure.

121
00:09:40,878 --> 00:09:42,612
Very shapely as well.

122
00:09:44,248 --> 00:09:47,317
<i>Oh, you try to hide her</i>
<i>under that dress.</i>

123
00:09:47,351 --> 00:09:49,319
If you wanted to hide her,

124
00:09:49,354 --> 00:09:51,722
you shouldn't have brought her
here in the first place.

125
00:09:57,729 --> 00:09:59,397
I can always see

126
00:09:59,431 --> 00:10:02,266
what's going on
beneath a dress.

127
00:10:02,301 --> 00:10:05,203
<i>Been at this a long time.</i>

128
00:10:06,471 --> 00:10:09,106
<i>I bet when you take</i>
<i>that dress off,</i>

129
00:10:09,141 --> 00:10:11,842
everything stays
right where it is.

130
00:10:11,876 --> 00:10:13,676
Doesn't drop an inch.

131
00:10:15,646 --> 00:10:19,214
Your king says he betrayed
me for love.

132
00:10:19,249 --> 00:10:21,984
I say he betrayed me
for firm tits

133
00:10:22,018 --> 00:10:24,620
and a tight fit.

134
00:10:24,654 --> 00:10:27,322
And I can respect that.

135
00:10:29,091 --> 00:10:32,360
When I was your age,
I'd have broken 50 oaths

136
00:10:32,394 --> 00:10:35,829
to get into that
without a second thought.

137
00:10:39,234 --> 00:10:42,636
Well, I've enough room
in the hall for you lot.

138
00:10:42,671 --> 00:10:44,738
We'll set up
tents outside

139
00:10:44,773 --> 00:10:47,141
with food and ale
for the rest of your men.

140
00:10:47,175 --> 00:10:49,343
Thank you, my lord.

141
00:10:52,614 --> 00:10:54,182
Well, let's get ready.

142
00:10:54,216 --> 00:10:56,251
The wine will flow red

143
00:10:56,285 --> 00:10:59,755
<i>and the music</i>
<i>will play loud</i>

144
00:10:59,789 --> 00:11:03,993
and we'll put
this mess behind us.

145
00:11:13,203 --> 00:11:14,703
Where?

146
00:11:14,738 --> 00:11:16,338
There.

147
00:11:23,446 --> 00:11:26,315
There.
It's a back gate.

148
00:11:26,349 --> 00:11:29,251
My men use it when they
visit Yunkai's bed slaves.

149
00:11:29,286 --> 00:11:30,987
Your men,
but not you?

150
00:11:31,021 --> 00:11:32,655
<i>I have no interest</i>
<i>in slaves.</i>

151
00:11:32,690 --> 00:11:34,958
A man cannot make love
to property.

152
00:11:38,196 --> 00:11:39,863
This is where
we enter the city.

153
00:11:39,931 --> 00:11:41,365
Very few guards.
They know me.

154
00:11:41,399 --> 00:11:42,900
They let me inside--

155
00:11:42,934 --> 00:11:45,169
We're not gonna sneak
an army through a back gate.

156
00:11:45,204 --> 00:11:48,173
I kill the guards.
I take your two best men

157
00:11:48,207 --> 00:11:51,576
and lead them through the back
streets, which I know well,

158
00:11:51,610 --> 00:11:53,711
and open the front gates.

159
00:11:53,745 --> 00:11:55,346
Then comes the army.

160
00:11:55,380 --> 00:11:58,015
Once the walls are breached,
the city will fall in hours.

161
00:11:58,050 --> 00:12:00,953
Or perhaps you'll lead Grey
Worm and me to the slaughter,

162
00:12:00,987 --> 00:12:03,455
cutting the head
off our army.

163
00:12:03,490 --> 00:12:06,225
<i>The masters of Yunkai</i>
<i>will pay you your fee</i>

164
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:07,627
and you won't have
to split it three ways

165
00:12:07,661 --> 00:12:09,662
'cause you've already
slaughtered your partners.

166
00:12:09,697 --> 00:12:12,165
You have
a very suspicious mind.

167
00:12:12,199 --> 00:12:15,268
In my experience, only dishonest
people think this way.

168
00:12:17,805 --> 00:12:19,639
You command the Unsullied.

169
00:12:19,673 --> 00:12:22,042
<i>What do you think?</i>

170
00:12:34,855 --> 00:12:36,022
You leave tonight.

171
00:12:36,056 --> 00:12:38,157
Very good.

172
00:12:38,191 --> 00:12:39,992
We'll prepare.

173
00:12:45,064 --> 00:12:46,698
Ser Jorah.

174
00:12:48,801 --> 00:12:50,402
You can use
an extra sword.

175
00:12:50,436 --> 00:12:52,938
You're the Queensguard,
Ser Barristan.

176
00:12:52,972 --> 00:12:55,007
Your place
is by the queen.

177
00:12:55,041 --> 00:12:57,476
If we are truly
her loyal servants,

178
00:12:57,510 --> 00:12:59,545
we'll do whatever
needs to be done

179
00:12:59,579 --> 00:13:03,716
no matter the cost,
no matter our pride.

180
00:13:06,787 --> 00:13:09,289
We're west
of Castle Black,

181
00:13:09,323 --> 00:13:11,324
but the Nightfort's
closest to us.

182
00:13:11,391 --> 00:13:14,494
It was the first
castle on the Wall.

183
00:13:14,528 --> 00:13:17,930
The Watch abandoned it during
the reign of King Jaehaerys I.

184
00:13:17,965 --> 00:13:21,634
Too big.
Impossible to maintain.

185
00:13:21,668 --> 00:13:24,003
Other than
Castle Black itself,

186
00:13:24,037 --> 00:13:26,505
the Nightfort's
the perfect castle for us.

187
00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:30,009
It's got a secret
sally port,

188
00:13:30,077 --> 00:13:32,645
the Black Gate,
as old as the Wall itself.

189
00:13:32,679 --> 00:13:36,415
No one's used it
in centuries most likely.

190
00:13:36,449 --> 00:13:39,117
It leads through the Wall

191
00:13:39,152 --> 00:13:41,052
right down
into the Nightfort,

192
00:13:41,087 --> 00:13:42,954
if one knows
how to find it,

193
00:13:42,989 --> 00:13:45,890
which, it just
so happens, I do.

194
00:13:50,529 --> 00:13:53,230
How do you know
all that?

195
00:13:53,298 --> 00:13:57,201
I read about it
in a very old book.

196
00:14:02,707 --> 00:14:04,274
You know all that

197
00:14:04,308 --> 00:14:07,243
from staring
at marks on paper?

198
00:14:08,312 --> 00:14:10,313
Yes.

199
00:14:10,381 --> 00:14:13,116
You're like a wizard.

200
00:14:28,267 --> 00:14:30,302
Our father
used to tell us

201
00:14:30,336 --> 00:14:34,707
that no wildling ever looked
upon the Wall and lived.

202
00:14:34,742 --> 00:14:37,243
Here we are.

203
00:14:37,311 --> 00:14:39,613
Alive.

204
00:14:55,863 --> 00:14:58,631
Remember what happens
to children who run.

205
00:14:58,665 --> 00:15:01,501
I'm your father
and I'll do the talking.

206
00:15:11,412 --> 00:15:13,747
The roads have gone
right to hell, haven't they?

207
00:15:13,781 --> 00:15:15,916
Cracked three spokes
this morning.

208
00:15:15,950 --> 00:15:17,952
- Need a hand?
- Need about eight hands.

209
00:15:17,986 --> 00:15:19,920
Oh!

210
00:15:19,954 --> 00:15:22,122
Got to get this
salt pork to the Twins

211
00:15:22,157 --> 00:15:24,758
in time for the wedding.

212
00:15:24,793 --> 00:15:27,294
Many thanks.

213
00:15:29,464 --> 00:15:31,031
Don't!

214
00:15:31,065 --> 00:15:32,366
Don't kill him.

215
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:34,568
Dead rats don't squeak.

216
00:15:34,602 --> 00:15:36,270
You're so dangerous,
aren't you?

217
00:15:36,337 --> 00:15:38,338
Saying scary things
to little girls.

218
00:15:38,373 --> 00:15:41,141
Killing little boys
and old people.

219
00:15:41,208 --> 00:15:42,609
A real hard man you are.

220
00:15:42,643 --> 00:15:44,611
More than anyone
you know.

221
00:15:44,645 --> 00:15:47,380
You're wrong.
I know a killer.

222
00:15:47,415 --> 00:15:50,050
- A real killer.
- That so?

223
00:15:50,084 --> 00:15:51,685
You'd be like
a kitten to him.

224
00:15:51,719 --> 00:15:54,054
He'd kill you
with his little finger.

225
00:15:54,088 --> 00:15:56,189
That him?

226
00:15:57,558 --> 00:15:59,592
- No.
- Good.

227
00:16:00,861 --> 00:16:02,562
Don't kill him.

228
00:16:02,629 --> 00:16:04,864
Please.

229
00:16:04,898 --> 00:16:07,033
Please don't.

230
00:16:09,670 --> 00:16:11,737
You're very kind.

231
00:16:11,772 --> 00:16:13,739
Someday it'll
get you killed.

232
00:16:31,091 --> 00:16:32,925
Where are we?

233
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:35,160
The Gift, I think.

234
00:16:35,195 --> 00:16:36,829
Brandon the Builder
gave all this land

235
00:16:36,863 --> 00:16:38,931
<i>south of the Wall</i>
<i>to the Night's Watch</i>

236
00:16:38,966 --> 00:16:41,901
for their sustenance
and support.

237
00:16:41,936 --> 00:16:44,204
Maester Luwin
taught me that.

238
00:16:46,007 --> 00:16:48,275
Doesn't seem to be supporting
anyone at the moment.

239
00:16:48,309 --> 00:16:52,012
It's good land
and there's no war up here.

240
00:16:52,046 --> 00:16:53,547
Why leave?

241
00:16:53,614 --> 00:16:55,282
Wildlings.

242
00:16:55,316 --> 00:16:57,050
Sorry.

243
00:16:57,084 --> 00:16:59,786
But they come over
the Wall and raid,

244
00:16:59,853 --> 00:17:01,654
steal, carry off women.

245
00:17:01,688 --> 00:17:03,889
Old Nan said they turn
your skull into a cup

246
00:17:03,924 --> 00:17:05,991
and make you drink
your own blood from it.

247
00:17:08,661 --> 00:17:10,362
That's what Old Nan said.

248
00:17:10,396 --> 00:17:12,064
There's a storm coming.

249
00:17:13,433 --> 00:17:15,734
I don't see any--

250
00:17:19,238 --> 00:17:20,939
It's as good a place
to shelter as any.

251
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:26,545
We can drink some blood
while we wait.

252
00:17:26,612 --> 00:17:28,713
I don't need much.

253
00:17:40,527 --> 00:17:42,962
Only one old man
and eight good horses.

254
00:17:43,029 --> 00:17:46,098
What's one old man
doing with eight horses?

255
00:17:46,132 --> 00:17:47,999
He breeds them
for the Watch.

256
00:17:48,034 --> 00:17:50,002
How's he keep folks
from stealing them?

257
00:17:50,036 --> 00:17:52,371
The Watch protects him.

258
00:17:52,406 --> 00:17:54,640
Not today they don't.

259
00:17:54,675 --> 00:17:57,344
He's selling horses,
he's got some gold in there.

260
00:17:57,378 --> 00:18:00,580
<i>- And proper steel.</i>
- Let's carve him up.

261
00:18:00,615 --> 00:18:01,982
We just take
the horses and go.

262
00:18:02,016 --> 00:18:04,685
The old man's no threat.

263
00:18:05,721 --> 00:18:07,154
I keep telling you.

264
00:18:07,188 --> 00:18:09,323
He's an old man.

265
00:18:09,357 --> 00:18:11,825
A spear through the heart's
a better way to die

266
00:18:11,893 --> 00:18:14,373
than coughing up your last with
no one but your horses to hear.

267
00:18:15,864 --> 00:18:19,199
The Watch might send a few men
looking for a horse thief.

268
00:18:19,234 --> 00:18:22,102
They'll send a lot more
to hunt down murderers.

269
00:18:22,137 --> 00:18:23,971
I hope so.

270
00:18:24,005 --> 00:18:26,941
Killing crows
in their castle is tough.

271
00:18:26,976 --> 00:18:28,910
Killing them out here
in the open,

272
00:18:28,977 --> 00:18:30,645
that's what we do.

273
00:18:30,679 --> 00:18:32,413
Spread out.

274
00:18:32,481 --> 00:18:35,016
Surround the hut
and move in.

275
00:19:17,793 --> 00:19:19,026
Ygritte!

276
00:19:21,096 --> 00:19:23,597
<i>Clear the barn!</i>

277
00:20:00,768 --> 00:20:04,170
No one's going to believe you're a
hog farmer if you eat them all.

278
00:20:04,238 --> 00:20:06,506
Best part of the animal.

279
00:20:11,213 --> 00:20:13,414
Don't worry.
They're still there.

280
00:20:14,650 --> 00:20:16,251
I know
they're still there.

281
00:20:16,285 --> 00:20:18,019
You check
every five minutes

282
00:20:18,087 --> 00:20:20,621
like you're afraid
they're gonna move.

283
00:20:20,656 --> 00:20:22,423
I'm not afraid.

284
00:20:22,458 --> 00:20:24,692
Of course you are.

285
00:20:24,727 --> 00:20:27,028
You're almost there

286
00:20:27,062 --> 00:20:29,664
and you're afraid
you won't make it.

287
00:20:29,732 --> 00:20:33,101
The closer you get,
the worse the fear gets.

288
00:20:33,135 --> 00:20:36,572
No point in trying to hide
behind that face.

289
00:20:36,606 --> 00:20:39,508
<i>I know fear</i>
<i>when I see it.</i>

290
00:20:39,542 --> 00:20:41,410
Seen it a lot.

291
00:20:42,712 --> 00:20:45,247
I knew fear
when I saw it in you.

292
00:20:46,716 --> 00:20:49,519
You're afraid of fire.

293
00:20:49,587 --> 00:20:51,288
When Beric's sword
went up in flames,

294
00:20:51,322 --> 00:20:53,156
you looked like
a scared little girl.

295
00:20:56,795 --> 00:20:59,129
And I know why, too.

296
00:21:00,999 --> 00:21:03,434
<i>I heard what</i>
<i>your brother did to you.</i>

297
00:21:04,570 --> 00:21:05,870
Pressed your face
to the fire

298
00:21:05,938 --> 00:21:08,506
like you're a nice
juicy mutton chop.

299
00:21:12,311 --> 00:21:14,479
That give you some ideas?

300
00:21:17,316 --> 00:21:19,985
Might do.

301
00:21:20,019 --> 00:21:22,354
Go ahead, then.

302
00:21:22,388 --> 00:21:24,756
You might get away.

303
00:21:24,791 --> 00:21:27,326
Might even make it
there on your own.

304
00:21:28,394 --> 00:21:30,629
They're just over
the river.

305
00:21:30,663 --> 00:21:32,798
The closest you've
been to family

306
00:21:32,832 --> 00:21:35,867
since Ilyn Payne
snipped your daddy's neck.

307
00:21:39,305 --> 00:21:42,307
Someday I'm gonna put
a sword through your eye

308
00:21:42,341 --> 00:21:43,975
and out the back
of your skull.

309
00:22:08,699 --> 00:22:12,134
How are we going
to get past the Wall?

310
00:22:12,169 --> 00:22:14,103
My uncle said
it's 700 feet high.

311
00:22:19,443 --> 00:22:21,010
How did you get past it?

312
00:22:25,048 --> 00:22:27,783
Got in a boat and rowed
past the Bay of Seals.

313
00:22:27,818 --> 00:22:31,019
It would take us two months
to get to the Bay of Seals.

314
00:22:31,053 --> 00:22:33,188
Some climb
straight up the ice.

315
00:22:33,255 --> 00:22:36,524
Even Hodor's not strong enough to
climb the Wall with me on his back.

316
00:22:36,592 --> 00:22:39,761
Hodor.

317
00:22:39,795 --> 00:22:42,330
19 castles guard the Wall.

318
00:22:42,365 --> 00:22:45,734
- Only three are still manned.
- Hodor!

319
00:22:45,769 --> 00:22:48,003
One of those abandoned fortresses
will give us a way through.

320
00:22:48,037 --> 00:22:50,272
My uncle said the gates were
sealed with ice and stone

321
00:22:50,306 --> 00:22:51,740
when the castles
were deserted.

322
00:22:51,774 --> 00:22:55,077
Well, we'll have
to open them up again.

323
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:59,415
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!
<i>- There's a rider out there.</i>

324
00:23:00,718 --> 00:23:02,652
Just one?

325
00:23:02,686 --> 00:23:04,454
<i>- There's more.</i>
- Hodor!

326
00:23:05,823 --> 00:23:07,323
Shh. Shh.

327
00:23:07,358 --> 00:23:10,093
- It's just thunder, sweet giant.
- Hodor.

328
00:23:10,161 --> 00:23:12,495
I yield.

329
00:23:12,563 --> 00:23:14,197
- <i>I yield.</i>
- Wildlings.

330
00:23:19,304 --> 00:23:20,805
Where's Shaggydog
and Summer?

331
00:23:20,839 --> 00:23:22,840
Hunting.

332
00:23:22,908 --> 00:23:24,876
Hodor!

333
00:23:24,910 --> 00:23:27,211
- Shh, quiet, Hodor.
- Hodor!

334
00:23:27,279 --> 00:23:29,246
Make him shut up.
If they hear us...

335
00:23:29,281 --> 00:23:31,449
- Hush, Hodor. No-- no more Hodoring.
- Hodor!

336
00:23:31,483 --> 00:23:34,385
- Hodor!
- Hodor, calm down.

337
00:23:34,420 --> 00:23:35,753
- You need to keep quiet.
- They're gonna hear us.

338
00:23:35,788 --> 00:23:37,955
<i>Hodor, be quiet.</i>

339
00:23:39,558 --> 00:23:41,626
- Ah! Hodor!
- Hodor, calm down.

340
00:23:41,694 --> 00:23:44,662
- Hodor! Hodor!
- Hodor, be quiet!

341
00:24:06,918 --> 00:24:08,619
What did you do?

342
00:24:08,653 --> 00:24:11,388
Nothing.

343
00:24:11,422 --> 00:24:13,357
I don't know.

344
00:24:17,462 --> 00:24:19,063
What's that?

345
00:24:20,298 --> 00:24:22,567
That's a horse dying.

346
00:24:32,644 --> 00:24:35,212
<i>Bring them over here.</i>

347
00:24:35,246 --> 00:24:38,415
<i>That was the last of them.</i>
<i>The rest are dead.</i>

348
00:24:38,449 --> 00:24:40,683
<i>I heard shouting up there.</i>

349
00:24:40,718 --> 00:24:42,852
Thunder.

350
00:24:42,886 --> 00:24:45,454
I know the difference
between shouting and thunder.

351
00:24:45,489 --> 00:24:48,623
Maybe it's ghosts.

352
00:24:58,534 --> 00:25:00,869
That won't
help you, grandpa.

353
00:25:05,241 --> 00:25:06,908
Where you riding?

354
00:25:06,942 --> 00:25:08,943
Doesn't matter now,
does it?

355
00:25:08,978 --> 00:25:11,713
No, it doesn't
matter now.

356
00:25:13,416 --> 00:25:16,818
Cut his throat or he'll
tell the crows we're here.

357
00:25:22,725 --> 00:25:24,459
You understand.

358
00:25:24,494 --> 00:25:26,461
Let me stand at least.

359
00:25:27,730 --> 00:25:29,898
<i>Let me go</i>
<i>with a bit of dignity.</i>

360
00:25:34,937 --> 00:25:36,638
Make the crow kill him.

361
00:25:40,176 --> 00:25:43,579
You're one of us now.
Prove it.

362
00:25:47,785 --> 00:25:50,387
The wolves are out there.

363
00:25:53,291 --> 00:25:55,025
I can't do it by choice.

364
00:25:55,060 --> 00:25:59,097
I don't know how.
It happens in my dreams.

365
00:25:59,131 --> 00:26:01,233
You're a warg, Bran.

366
00:26:01,267 --> 00:26:03,335
It's in your blood.

367
00:26:03,369 --> 00:26:04,837
I can't.

368
00:26:04,871 --> 00:26:06,772
You just did with him.

369
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:08,808
A wolf is nothing
compared to that.

370
00:26:16,516 --> 00:26:18,250
She looks sharp.

371
00:26:27,861 --> 00:26:29,930
Do it.

372
00:26:30,932 --> 00:26:32,399
Do it.

373
00:26:32,433 --> 00:26:35,568
I told you.
He's still one of them.

374
00:26:37,771 --> 00:26:39,338
Go on, boy.

375
00:26:42,242 --> 00:26:43,542
Go on!

376
00:26:52,318 --> 00:26:54,119
He's a crow.

377
00:26:54,153 --> 00:26:56,087
<i>He'll always be a crow.</i>

378
00:26:56,122 --> 00:26:58,489
And here's his crow wife
guarding him.

379
00:26:58,523 --> 00:27:01,726
He'll stab us in the back
first chance he gets.

380
00:27:04,663 --> 00:27:07,031
Kill him.

381
00:27:22,314 --> 00:27:24,349
- He's one of them.
- No!

382
00:27:24,383 --> 00:27:25,883
Do you hear me?

383
00:27:31,891 --> 00:27:35,193
You're not gonna die
for one of them.

384
00:27:36,996 --> 00:27:39,498
Do it.

385
00:27:39,532 --> 00:27:41,366
They'll find us
if you don't.

386
00:28:11,066 --> 00:28:13,034
You were right
the whole time.

387
00:28:39,026 --> 00:28:40,593
Hyah!

388
00:28:59,647 --> 00:29:02,282
<i>When you hear a songbird's</i>
<i>whistle, you come.</i>

389
00:29:02,316 --> 00:29:06,086
I'm a great whistler.
The greatest in the land.

390
00:29:11,325 --> 00:29:14,060
Daario Naharis.

391
00:29:41,955 --> 00:29:44,323
<i>That one was quick.</i>

392
00:29:47,093 --> 00:29:49,127
- There may be others.
- I doubt it.

393
00:29:49,162 --> 00:29:52,030
The Yunkish prefer to let their
slaves do their fighting for them.

394
00:30:37,245 --> 00:30:39,947
That's what you call
a few guards?

395
00:31:04,140 --> 00:31:06,341
Come on!
What do you got, huh?

396
00:32:20,414 --> 00:32:23,116
Lord Edmure...

397
00:32:24,786 --> 00:32:27,054
I hope I'm not
a disappointment to you.

398
00:32:35,597 --> 00:32:38,066
You're a delight
to me, my lady.

399
00:32:39,702 --> 00:32:41,370
You may now cloak
the bride

400
00:32:41,404 --> 00:32:43,472
and bring her under
your protection.

401
00:33:12,536 --> 00:33:14,136
In the sight of the Seven,

402
00:33:14,171 --> 00:33:17,840
I hereby seal
these two souls,

403
00:33:17,875 --> 00:33:21,477
binding them as one
for eternity.

404
00:33:21,512 --> 00:33:24,447
<i>Look upon each other</i>
<i>and say the words.</i>

405
00:33:27,017 --> 00:33:29,285
Father, Smith,

406
00:33:29,353 --> 00:33:31,687
Warrior, Mother,

407
00:33:31,722 --> 00:33:34,758
Maiden, Crone,
Stranger...

408
00:33:34,792 --> 00:33:36,893
- I am hers...
- I am his...

409
00:33:36,928 --> 00:33:39,062
- <i>and she is mine...</i>
- <i>and he is mine...</i>

410
00:33:39,097 --> 00:33:43,100
<i>...from this day</i>
<i>until the end of my days.</i>

411
00:33:47,806 --> 00:33:50,675
- Is that safe?
- They're long gone.

412
00:33:56,114 --> 00:33:57,647
You were right.

413
00:33:57,715 --> 00:34:00,216
I can get inside Summer's
mind whenever I want.

414
00:34:00,283 --> 00:34:02,451
Of course you can.

415
00:34:03,753 --> 00:34:05,053
North of the Wall
there are wildlings

416
00:34:05,088 --> 00:34:08,089
who can control
all sorts of animals.

417
00:34:08,124 --> 00:34:10,458
<i>But you did a lot</i>
<i>more than that.</i>

418
00:34:12,261 --> 00:34:15,363
You got inside
Hodor's mind.

419
00:34:15,397 --> 00:34:18,232
They can't do that
north of the Wall?

420
00:34:20,570 --> 00:34:22,671
No one can do that...

421
00:34:22,705 --> 00:34:23,806
<i>anywhere.</i>

422
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:33,115
When I was looking
through Summer's eyes,

423
00:34:33,149 --> 00:34:34,816
- I saw Jon.
- Where?

424
00:34:34,851 --> 00:34:36,618
He was with the wildlings.

425
00:34:36,652 --> 00:34:38,687
They tried to kill him,
but he got away.

426
00:34:38,721 --> 00:34:40,355
<i>He'll be heading back</i>
<i>to Castle Black, then.</i>

427
00:34:40,390 --> 00:34:42,224
That's where we should go.

428
00:34:42,258 --> 00:34:44,626
For all we know, Castle
Black's already under attack.

429
00:34:44,661 --> 00:34:47,462
- If this many wildlings got through--
- I already told you.

430
00:34:47,530 --> 00:34:49,498
I'm not going
north of the Wall.

431
00:34:49,532 --> 00:34:52,501
Everything Jojen
told me is true.

432
00:34:54,437 --> 00:34:56,705
You saw what I did
to Hodor.

433
00:34:56,739 --> 00:34:58,707
<i>I have to find</i>
<i>the three-eyed raven.</i>

434
00:34:58,741 --> 00:35:00,309
Listen to me,
little lord.

435
00:35:00,343 --> 00:35:01,576
Don't worry.

436
00:35:01,610 --> 00:35:04,713
I'm not asking you
to come with me.

437
00:35:06,650 --> 00:35:08,417
It won't be safe
for Rickon.

438
00:35:08,452 --> 00:35:11,521
Me?
I'm coming with you.

439
00:35:11,555 --> 00:35:14,057
No.

440
00:35:14,091 --> 00:35:16,726
You and Osha and Shaggydog
head for the Last Hearth.

441
00:35:16,761 --> 00:35:19,963
The Umbers are our bannermen.
They'll protect you.

442
00:35:19,998 --> 00:35:21,732
I'm coming with you.

443
00:35:21,766 --> 00:35:23,634
I'm your brother.

444
00:35:23,668 --> 00:35:25,970
I have to protect you.

445
00:35:27,873 --> 00:35:31,208
Right now I have
to protect you.

446
00:35:31,243 --> 00:35:34,378
Robb's at war and I'm
going beyond the Wall.

447
00:35:34,412 --> 00:35:36,781
If something
happens to us,

448
00:35:36,815 --> 00:35:38,883
you're the heir
to Winterfell.

449
00:35:40,919 --> 00:35:43,121
Would you know how
to find the Last Hearth?

450
00:35:43,155 --> 00:35:46,258
You southerners build your big
castles and you never move.

451
00:35:46,292 --> 00:35:47,926
You're easy to find.

452
00:35:47,994 --> 00:35:50,696
We're not southerners.

453
00:35:50,730 --> 00:35:53,799
And I don't want
to leave you.

454
00:35:53,833 --> 00:35:56,635
Shh, shh.
Come here, little soldier.

455
00:35:58,104 --> 00:36:01,707
You and me, we're gonna
have some adventures.

456
00:36:01,742 --> 00:36:04,110
You don't have to do
any of this.

457
00:36:05,445 --> 00:36:06,912
Your family
took me in

458
00:36:06,947 --> 00:36:09,282
and was good to me when
they had no cause to be.

459
00:36:09,316 --> 00:36:11,651
<i>Shh.</i>

460
00:36:11,685 --> 00:36:13,953
We'll be fine,
you and me.

461
00:36:13,987 --> 00:36:16,222
The Umbers
are great warriors.

462
00:36:16,256 --> 00:36:18,891
Even I heard
about them growing up.

463
00:36:18,926 --> 00:36:21,294
They'll teach you
how to swing a sword.

464
00:36:21,328 --> 00:36:24,864
I know how
to swing a sword.

465
00:36:31,771 --> 00:36:34,540
You're leaving now?
It's the middle of the night.

466
00:36:34,574 --> 00:36:36,442
I learned to walk
in darkness.

467
00:36:38,912 --> 00:36:40,613
Say your good-byes,
little man.

468
00:36:48,554 --> 00:36:50,789
Keep this one safe.

469
00:36:52,558 --> 00:36:54,625
He means
the world to me.

470
00:37:15,716 --> 00:37:18,250
We've been waiting
a long time.

471
00:37:20,487 --> 00:37:22,288
Haven't we?

472
00:37:23,790 --> 00:37:25,224
I don't know,
you tell me.

473
00:37:25,259 --> 00:37:27,460
How long does it take
to sack a city?

474
00:37:35,702 --> 00:37:37,803
It was just as you said.

475
00:37:37,837 --> 00:37:41,239
They did not believe
until it was too late.

476
00:37:41,273 --> 00:37:43,274
Their slave soldiers

477
00:37:43,309 --> 00:37:46,778
threw down their spears
and surrendered.

478
00:37:50,882 --> 00:37:53,451
And Daario Naharis?

479
00:38:14,008 --> 00:38:16,576
The city is yours,
my queen.

480
00:38:39,701 --> 00:38:41,235
They're good,
aren't they?

481
00:38:41,269 --> 00:38:43,003
They ought to be
because they cost enough.

482
00:38:50,212 --> 00:38:53,414
Look at the crowd there.

483
00:38:56,851 --> 00:38:59,053
He complained
about this marriage

484
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:01,322
the entire ride
from Riverrun,

485
00:39:01,356 --> 00:39:02,857
<i>and now look at him.</i>

486
00:39:02,891 --> 00:39:04,858
<i>The gods love</i>
<i>to reward a fool.</i>

487
00:39:04,893 --> 00:39:07,394
- Uncle.
- What?

488
00:39:07,428 --> 00:39:10,397
He's my nephew.
I love him.

489
00:39:10,431 --> 00:39:12,433
And he's a damned fool.

490
00:39:17,805 --> 00:39:20,207
Don't you drink,
Lord Bolton?

491
00:39:20,241 --> 00:39:22,543
Never do, my lady.
Dulls the senses.

492
00:39:22,577 --> 00:39:24,812
That's the point.

493
00:39:24,846 --> 00:39:26,647
Didn't you marry
one of these Frey girls?

494
00:39:26,681 --> 00:39:28,149
Aye.

495
00:39:28,183 --> 00:39:30,251
Lord Walder let me choose
any of his granddaughters

496
00:39:30,285 --> 00:39:34,388
and promised me the girl's
weight in silver as a dowry.

497
00:39:34,456 --> 00:39:36,257
So I have
a fat young bride.

498
00:39:38,293 --> 00:39:40,261
I hope she makes you
very happy.

499
00:39:40,295 --> 00:39:42,096
Well, she's made me
very rich.

500
00:39:42,164 --> 00:39:44,766
Pardon, my lord,
my lady.

501
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:47,268
I need to find
a tree to piss on.

502
00:39:49,338 --> 00:39:51,673
My mother's alone
with Roose Bolton.

503
00:39:51,740 --> 00:39:53,141
I should rescue her.

504
00:39:53,175 --> 00:39:55,109
Your mother is less
in need of rescue

505
00:39:55,144 --> 00:39:57,111
than any woman
I've ever met.

506
00:39:57,146 --> 00:39:58,213
Be kind.

507
00:39:58,247 --> 00:40:00,248
She's finally starting
to like you.

508
00:40:01,917 --> 00:40:03,718
And I like her.

509
00:40:03,753 --> 00:40:06,955
But if she had her way,
I would be back in Volantis

510
00:40:06,989 --> 00:40:10,258
playing my harp and you
would be sitting over there

511
00:40:10,293 --> 00:40:13,295
<i>eating blackberries</i>
<i>out of Roslin Frey's hand.</i>

512
00:40:13,329 --> 00:40:15,497
Perhaps I've made
a terrible mistake.

513
00:40:18,401 --> 00:40:21,303
Striking your king
is an act of treason.

514
00:40:24,641 --> 00:40:26,409
No, don't.

515
00:40:27,344 --> 00:40:28,978
Don't insult them.

516
00:40:31,648 --> 00:40:33,649
Your Grace.

517
00:40:40,423 --> 00:40:44,326
The septon has prayed
his prayers,

518
00:40:44,360 --> 00:40:46,561
<i>some words were said,</i>

519
00:40:46,596 --> 00:40:48,396
and Lord Edmure

520
00:40:48,464 --> 00:40:51,365
has wrapped my daughter
in a cloak.

521
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:55,837
But they are not yet
man and wife.

522
00:40:55,871 --> 00:40:58,440
A sword needs a sheath.

523
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:08,249
And a wedding needs a bedding.

524
00:41:08,284 --> 00:41:10,151
What does my sire say?

525
00:41:10,186 --> 00:41:13,188
To bed! To bed! To bed!

526
00:41:18,494 --> 00:41:20,896
If you think the time
is right, Lord Walder,

527
00:41:20,930 --> 00:41:25,133
by all means,
let us bed them.

528
00:41:31,741 --> 00:41:34,410
To bed! To bed! To bed!

529
00:41:40,417 --> 00:41:42,919
<i>Go on!</i>

530
00:42:00,605 --> 00:42:03,707
Oh!
Careful now, ladies.

531
00:42:03,741 --> 00:42:05,775
Once you set
that monster free,

532
00:42:05,810 --> 00:42:08,578
there's no caging
him again.

533
00:42:08,612 --> 00:42:11,914
To bed! To bed! To bed!

534
00:42:15,652 --> 00:42:17,253
Poor girl.

535
00:42:17,287 --> 00:42:20,189
Every bride
suffers the same.

536
00:42:20,223 --> 00:42:22,825
I'm sure you endured
yours with grace.

537
00:42:22,859 --> 00:42:25,361
Oh, Ned forbade it.

538
00:42:25,396 --> 00:42:26,484
He said it wouldn't be right

539
00:42:26,509 --> 00:42:28,541
if he broke a man's jaw
on our wedding night.

540
00:42:37,075 --> 00:42:40,176
That is a very
strange custom.

541
00:42:40,211 --> 00:42:42,112
I suppose it does
seem strange

542
00:42:42,146 --> 00:42:43,813
from a foreigner's
perspective.

543
00:42:43,848 --> 00:42:45,649
It seems normal
to you?

544
00:42:45,716 --> 00:42:48,085
It's a tradition.

545
00:42:49,921 --> 00:42:52,789
Without the bedding ceremony,
there's no real proof

546
00:42:52,824 --> 00:42:55,359
the lord and lady
consummated their marriage.

547
00:42:55,393 --> 00:42:58,729
But there are other ways
of providing proof.

548
00:43:01,099 --> 00:43:02,866
Boy or girl?

549
00:43:05,237 --> 00:43:06,938
I don't know.

550
00:43:06,972 --> 00:43:10,141
But if it's a boy, I know
what we should name him.

551
00:43:10,175 --> 00:43:12,343
Oh, do you?

552
00:43:12,377 --> 00:43:13,752
It seems to me the father

553
00:43:13,777 --> 00:43:15,790
should have some say in
his son's naming.

554
00:43:15,881 --> 00:43:17,215
Eddard.

555
00:43:20,886 --> 00:43:22,921
Don't you want to teach
little Ned Stark

556
00:43:22,955 --> 00:43:25,390
how to ride horses?

557
00:43:25,424 --> 00:43:27,625
I do.

558
00:44:23,547 --> 00:44:25,715
<i>Go on, line 'em up!</i>

559
00:44:42,368 --> 00:44:44,770
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

560
00:44:48,041 --> 00:44:49,575
Where are you going?

561
00:44:49,610 --> 00:44:51,343
Got salt pork
for the feast.

562
00:44:51,411 --> 00:44:53,578
The feast is over.

563
00:44:53,613 --> 00:44:56,014
<i>Doesn't sound</i>
<i>like it's over.</i>

564
00:44:56,048 --> 00:44:58,916
If I tell you
it's over, it's over.

565
00:44:58,951 --> 00:45:03,153
Turn this cart around
and get the hell out of here.

566
00:45:03,188 --> 00:45:05,155
Got pig's feet, too.

567
00:45:06,323 --> 00:45:08,424
Are you soft
in the head?

568
00:45:08,459 --> 00:45:10,193
Turn this cart around.

569
00:45:22,839 --> 00:45:24,473
Your Grace.

570
00:45:30,314 --> 00:45:34,650
<i>I feel</i>
<i>I've been remiss</i>

571
00:45:34,684 --> 00:45:36,418
in my duties.

572
00:45:36,452 --> 00:45:40,156
<i>I've given you meat</i>
<i>and wine and music,</i>

573
00:45:40,190 --> 00:45:42,858
<i>but I haven't shown you</i>

574
00:45:42,893 --> 00:45:45,961
<i>the hospitality</i>
<i>you deserve.</i>

575
00:45:47,130 --> 00:45:48,598
<i>My king has married</i>

576
00:45:48,632 --> 00:45:52,068
<i>and I owe my new queen</i>
<i>a wedding gift.</i>

577
00:45:56,841 --> 00:45:59,343
Robb!

578
00:46:46,155 --> 00:46:48,256
You ready to head home
to Winterfell, right?

579
00:46:51,494 --> 00:46:52,994
<i>Feast over yet, is it?</i>

580
00:46:53,029 --> 00:46:55,530
Aye, it's over.

581
00:47:25,861 --> 00:47:27,661
Follow him.

582
00:47:30,165 --> 00:47:32,466
<i>Aim!</i>

583
00:48:01,131 --> 00:48:03,466
It's too late.

584
00:48:44,306 --> 00:48:47,408
The King
in the North arises.

585
00:49:09,065 --> 00:49:11,266
Lord Walder!

586
00:49:11,334 --> 00:49:12,934
Lord Walder, enough!

587
00:49:12,968 --> 00:49:15,403
Let it end!

588
00:49:17,006 --> 00:49:19,040
Please.

589
00:49:19,107 --> 00:49:21,209
He is my son.

590
00:49:21,276 --> 00:49:23,544
<i>My first son.</i>

591
00:49:23,579 --> 00:49:26,147
Let him go and I swear
that we will forget this.

592
00:49:26,182 --> 00:49:28,850
I swear it by
the old gods and new.

593
00:49:28,884 --> 00:49:30,385
We will take
no vengeance.

594
00:49:30,420 --> 00:49:34,089
You already swore me one oath
right here in my castle.

595
00:49:34,124 --> 00:49:37,926
You swore by all the gods your
son would marry my daughter!

596
00:49:37,961 --> 00:49:41,296
<i>Take me for a hostage,</i>
<i>but let Robb go.</i>

597
00:49:41,331 --> 00:49:43,498
Robb, get up.

598
00:49:43,533 --> 00:49:45,267
Get up and walk out.

599
00:49:45,301 --> 00:49:47,702
Please!

600
00:49:49,372 --> 00:49:52,107
Please!

601
00:49:52,141 --> 00:49:55,978
And why would I
let him do that?

602
00:49:58,615 --> 00:50:01,350
On my honor as a Tully,

603
00:50:01,418 --> 00:50:04,153
on my honor as a Stark,

604
00:50:04,221 --> 00:50:07,056
let him go

605
00:50:07,090 --> 00:50:10,193
or I will cut
your wife's throat.

606
00:50:18,669 --> 00:50:21,270
I'll find another.

607
00:50:24,041 --> 00:50:26,509
Mother.

608
00:50:27,745 --> 00:50:29,278
The Lannisters send
their regards.

609
