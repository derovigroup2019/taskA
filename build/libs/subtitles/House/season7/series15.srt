1
00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:08,378
House?

2
00:00:12,466 --> 00:00:14,000
House?

3
00:00:19,174 --> 00:00:20,757
Oh! My God!

4
00:00:20,808 --> 00:00:22,125
What the hell?

5
00:00:23,178 --> 00:00:24,201
Gotcha.

6
00:00:24,202 --> 00:00:25,669
Did you actually wake up early

7
00:00:25,737 --> 00:00:27,955
and hide under the bed just
to scare the crap outta me?

8
00:00:28,022 --> 00:00:30,273
Set an alarm and everything.

9
00:00:30,325 --> 00:00:32,876
It's like dating
a ten-year-old.

10
00:00:32,944 --> 00:00:35,546
God, I hope not.

11
00:00:48,125 --> 00:00:50,126
Now that we're down here...

12
00:00:50,178 --> 00:00:52,229
Hold that thought.

13
00:00:52,296 --> 00:00:53,263
Seriously?

14
00:00:53,314 --> 00:00:54,648
I have to pee.

15
00:00:56,768 --> 00:00:58,468
I'll wait.

16
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:01,188
I brought a book.

17
00:01:02,740 --> 00:01:04,641
I didn't know what time
your alarm was set for.

18
00:01:04,692 --> 00:01:06,159
<i>House?</i>

19
00:01:06,244 --> 00:01:08,395
You know, you can rent
this space out down here.

20
00:01:08,463 --> 00:01:10,364
In Japan,
that would be like a deluxe...

21
00:01:10,431 --> 00:01:12,366
<i>House, shut up.</i>

22
00:01:14,318 --> 00:01:16,887
There's blood in my urine.

23
00:01:17,087 --> 00:01:27,287
<font color="#ec14bd">Sync by honeybunny</font>
<font color="#ec14bd">www.addic7ed.com</font>

24
00:01:27,482 --> 00:01:29,349
You really don't
have to be here.

25
00:01:29,434 --> 00:01:32,019
You're my girlfriend.
I'm being supportive.

26
00:01:32,086 --> 00:01:33,887
I'm mainly talking about them.

27
00:01:36,173 --> 00:01:37,691
Well, given that
there's almost certainly

28
00:01:37,775 --> 00:01:39,359
nothing wrong with you,

29
00:01:39,444 --> 00:01:41,678
and my patient definitely
has something wrong with him...

30
00:01:41,729 --> 00:01:43,196
That can't wait an hour?

31
00:01:43,281 --> 00:01:44,164
'Fraid not.

32
00:01:44,232 --> 00:01:46,733
He's...

33
00:01:46,801 --> 00:01:48,368
Chase.

34
00:01:48,453 --> 00:01:50,387
16-year-old male
spit up blood

35
00:01:50,455 --> 00:01:51,905
during a pick-up
basketball game.

36
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:53,640
E.R. couldn't find
the source in his lungs

37
00:01:53,708 --> 00:01:55,358
or GI tract.

38
00:01:55,410 --> 00:01:57,160
See? Serious.

39
00:01:57,211 --> 00:01:59,529
<i>Could be vasculitis, bronchiectasis,</i>

40
00:01:59,581 --> 00:02:01,415
inhaled particles.
What about angiodysplasia?

41
00:02:01,499 --> 00:02:03,350
Ready when you are...

42
00:02:03,418 --> 00:02:05,085
Get them outta here.

43
00:02:05,153 --> 00:02:07,671
<i>My urethra is not</i>
<i>for public entertainment.</i>

44
00:02:07,722 --> 00:02:10,140
But it is
a good-time adjacent.

45
00:02:10,207 --> 00:02:11,207
Feed the kid a camera.

46
00:02:11,259 --> 00:02:14,144
Check his got for
angiodysplasia.

47
00:02:14,211 --> 00:02:16,480
All right.
If you could scoot down.

48
00:02:16,547 --> 00:02:19,049
Hey, I'm, uh,
I'm missing a watch.

49
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:20,901
So can you keep your eyes open while...
<i>Okay!</i>

50
00:02:20,985 --> 00:02:22,069
You too.

51
00:02:26,465 --> 00:02:27,879
This little camera

52
00:02:28,932 --> 00:02:31,635
transmits images
to the data recorder

53
00:02:31,636 --> 00:02:32,903
so we can see

54
00:02:32,971 --> 00:02:35,789
if you've got any
vascular malformations

55
00:02:35,857 --> 00:02:37,307
<i>in your GI tract.</i>

56
00:02:37,359 --> 00:02:40,143
Your records show
you've lost some weight

57
00:02:40,195 --> 00:02:41,462
over the past year.

58
00:02:41,530 --> 00:02:43,280
Was that intentional?
Not really.

59
00:02:43,331 --> 00:02:44,615
<i>Well, he's been</i>

60
00:02:44,683 --> 00:02:46,617
eating less
since he quit the swim team.

61
00:02:46,668 --> 00:02:48,752
You have to get up early
for swim.

62
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:50,588
It wasn't fun anymore.

63
00:02:50,655 --> 00:02:53,624
I need to talk to your son
about sexual activity.

64
00:02:53,675 --> 00:02:55,209
<i>Generally, it's less</i>
<i>embarrassing for everyone...</i>

65
00:02:55,293 --> 00:02:57,494
We're leaving.

66
00:03:00,682 --> 00:03:03,017
Actually, I've only...

67
00:03:03,084 --> 00:03:05,836
How long have you been
cutting yourself?

68
00:03:08,857 --> 00:03:11,859
Those are from a layback grind
that went wrong.

69
00:03:11,927 --> 00:03:13,861
Came off my skateboard
straight into a fence.

70
00:03:13,929 --> 00:03:15,729
So...No to cutting

71
00:03:15,797 --> 00:03:18,432
but yes to appetite
and sleep changes,

72
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:21,902
and you quit something
you used to enjoy.

73
00:03:21,987 --> 00:03:24,138
How long have you
been depressed?

74
00:03:26,374 --> 00:03:27,908
<i>Imaging showed no sign</i>

75
00:03:27,993 --> 00:03:29,376
of upper GI issues.

76
00:03:29,461 --> 00:03:30,911
But the kid did admit
to being depressed

77
00:03:30,996 --> 00:03:33,881
and to smoking pot
to take the edge off.

78
00:03:33,965 --> 00:03:36,383
You are very pleased
with yourself, aren't you?

79
00:03:36,468 --> 00:03:38,586
His marijuana could be laced
with formaldehyde or lead,

80
00:03:38,670 --> 00:03:40,203
which could cause
a pulmonary hemorrhage

81
00:03:40,255 --> 00:03:42,606
which could make him
spit up blood.

82
00:03:42,674 --> 00:03:45,509
Yes. Yes, I am.
I thought it was a good catch.

83
00:03:48,179 --> 00:03:52,232
Run a lead level
and push 5 liters iv fluid.

84
00:03:54,769 --> 00:03:57,438
Feel free to tip
your other server.

85
00:03:59,858 --> 00:04:01,859
Cystoscopy was clean.

86
00:04:01,910 --> 00:04:05,112
Cytopathology was normal.
Why do you have my lab results?

87
00:04:05,196 --> 00:04:06,447
I don't.

88
00:04:06,531 --> 00:04:08,398
If I did,
I'd know you were fine.

89
00:04:08,450 --> 00:04:11,001
Unless the blood
came from my kidneys.

90
00:04:11,069 --> 00:04:12,920
Come on.
Your hypochondriac mom

91
00:04:13,004 --> 00:04:15,739
had a brush with mortality
last month,

92
00:04:15,790 --> 00:04:18,926
and it's understandable that
you're worrying more than usual,

93
00:04:19,010 --> 00:04:22,429
worrying that you might
turn into her.

94
00:04:25,416 --> 00:04:27,468
You're right.

95
00:04:29,387 --> 00:04:31,972
Odds are, this is nothing.

96
00:04:32,057 --> 00:04:35,476
Meet me in the cafeteria
in ten.

97
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:38,312
There'll be a corn dog
with your name on it.

98
00:04:38,396 --> 00:04:41,682
I mean an actual corn dog.
They fixed the deep fryer.

99
00:04:52,577 --> 00:04:54,878
I need to schedule
an ultrasound.

100
00:04:57,832 --> 00:04:59,583
My dad's head's
still in one piece,

101
00:04:59,634 --> 00:05:01,802
so I'm guessing you didn't
mention the pot.

102
00:05:01,886 --> 00:05:02,953
<i>What'd you tell him?</i>

103
00:05:03,021 --> 00:05:05,005
The truth.
You had a...

104
00:05:05,090 --> 00:05:06,390
Minor chemical exposure,

105
00:05:06,457 --> 00:05:08,609
and we can't be 100% sure
how it happened.

106
00:05:08,677 --> 00:05:10,344
Thanks for covering.

107
00:05:10,428 --> 00:05:12,813
I know what it's like to be 16.

108
00:05:12,881 --> 00:05:14,481
You also know what
it's like to be depressed.

109
00:05:14,566 --> 00:05:17,300
You figured out my deal
after only a few minutes,

110
00:05:17,352 --> 00:05:19,970
but I been fooling my friends
and parents for months.

111
00:05:20,021 --> 00:05:22,940
It's my job to notice things.

112
00:05:22,991 --> 00:05:25,743
Maybe talking to your parents
would make things better.

113
00:05:25,810 --> 00:05:27,111
I've tried.

114
00:05:27,162 --> 00:05:29,580
They take it personally
that I'm not happy,

115
00:05:29,647 --> 00:05:32,950
and then I end up having
to make them feel better.

116
00:05:33,001 --> 00:05:35,302
They don't get me.

117
00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:37,705
No one does.

118
00:05:40,892 --> 00:05:44,161
In med school, it seemed like

119
00:05:44,229 --> 00:05:46,830
everybody else
could handle the pressure.

120
00:05:46,881 --> 00:05:50,100
I couldn't.

121
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:54,138
I ended up hurting myself.

122
00:05:54,205 --> 00:05:58,025
Stupidest thing I've ever done.

123
00:06:02,864 --> 00:06:05,799
You've got red spots
in your eyes.

124
00:06:05,867 --> 00:06:08,986
They weren't there before.

125
00:06:15,427 --> 00:06:16,727
You have nice skin.

126
00:06:16,795 --> 00:06:18,361
Thank you.
Shut up!

127
00:06:18,413 --> 00:06:21,165
Sorry. Just thought it would
be rude not to comment.

128
00:06:21,232 --> 00:06:23,250
Just treat me like
any other patient.

129
00:06:23,334 --> 00:06:25,369
Right.

130
00:06:26,971 --> 00:06:28,972
Are you sucking in
your stomach?

131
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:29,923
No.

132
00:06:31,459 --> 00:06:33,710
Hurry up before I pass out.

133
00:06:37,098 --> 00:06:38,398
Wilson?

134
00:06:43,605 --> 00:06:45,088
Ultrasound isn't definitive.

135
00:06:45,156 --> 00:06:46,523
We should run other
tests before...

136
00:06:46,591 --> 00:06:50,227
Stop talking like a doctor
and tell me what you see.

137
00:06:50,278 --> 00:06:52,663
There's a mass in your kidney.

138
00:06:58,808 --> 00:07:00,659
We still don't know
why Ryan coughed blood,

139
00:07:00,727 --> 00:07:03,028
and now he's got small
hemorrhages in his eyes.

140
00:07:03,096 --> 00:07:04,563
Sounds like an acquired
coagulapathy

141
00:07:04,614 --> 00:07:06,148
which gives us
a pretty wide differential.

142
00:07:06,232 --> 00:07:07,265
Gets a lot narrower

143
00:07:07,317 --> 00:07:08,533
if we factor in his depression.

144
00:07:08,601 --> 00:07:09,901
Oh, don't do that!

145
00:07:09,952 --> 00:07:13,121
Mood swings can be a symptom
of physiological illness.

146
00:07:13,206 --> 00:07:14,323
I'm not talking to you.

147
00:07:14,407 --> 00:07:16,325
Mood swings are also
a symptom of adolescence

148
00:07:16,409 --> 00:07:18,760
along with emo music
and masturbation.

149
00:07:18,828 --> 00:07:20,045
<i>More importantly,</i>
<i>his weight loss</i>

150
00:07:20,112 --> 00:07:21,613
<i>and sleeping issues</i>
<i>started a year ago.</i>

151
00:07:21,681 --> 00:07:23,081
<i>Infection makes the most sense.</i>

152
00:07:23,132 --> 00:07:25,250
He shoots hoops at school,
showers in the locker room.

153
00:07:25,301 --> 00:07:27,336
I'm thinking staph.
Damn!

154
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:28,754
You don't think...

155
00:07:28,805 --> 00:07:29,838
Not talking to you!

156
00:07:32,291 --> 00:07:34,843
Everything okay with Cuddy?
She's fine.

157
00:07:34,927 --> 00:07:36,511
She's just too stupid
to accept it.

158
00:07:36,596 --> 00:07:38,963
Start him on nafcillin
for staph.

159
00:07:40,767 --> 00:07:42,200
All that's in the, uh,

160
00:07:42,268 --> 00:07:44,436
first mutual safety
deposit box.

161
00:07:44,504 --> 00:07:45,687
The retirement accounts...

162
00:07:49,908 --> 00:07:51,692
You're freaking out
because of one ultrasound

163
00:07:51,743 --> 00:07:54,662
performed by an incompetent
bonobo monkey.

164
00:07:54,729 --> 00:07:56,247
As demonstrated
by my sitting here calmly

165
00:07:56,331 --> 00:07:57,365
going about my business.

166
00:07:57,416 --> 00:07:59,684
Calling a lawyer,
drafting a will!

167
00:07:59,751 --> 00:08:01,035
Okay. I-I...

168
00:08:01,086 --> 00:08:03,254
Hacked into your
online schedule.

169
00:08:03,338 --> 00:08:05,373
Look, tests always
show something.

170
00:08:05,424 --> 00:08:07,258
A mass in your kidney
could be a complex cyst.

171
00:08:07,326 --> 00:08:09,260
<i>It could be benign.</i>
<i>I'm a single mom.</i>

172
00:08:09,344 --> 00:08:11,262
I need to set up a trust,
appoint a guardian.

173
00:08:11,346 --> 00:08:13,047
It's silly that I haven't
done it before now.

174
00:08:13,115 --> 00:08:14,966
<i>But you're doing it now</i>
<i>because you think you're sick.</i>

175
00:08:15,050 --> 00:08:16,300
The freaking out
can at least wait

176
00:08:16,385 --> 00:08:18,019
until after the biopsy
this afternoon.

177
00:08:18,086 --> 00:08:19,220
The biopsy's not till tomorrow.

178
00:08:19,271 --> 00:08:21,472
It's the first opening
in the schedule.

179
00:08:21,556 --> 00:08:22,606
For the dean of medicine,

180
00:08:22,691 --> 00:08:24,475
the first opening
in the schedule is...

181
00:08:24,559 --> 00:08:26,110
Oh, look! Now.

182
00:08:26,178 --> 00:08:28,229
My worry isn't any more
important than anyone else's.

183
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:29,397
Actually, it is.

184
00:08:29,448 --> 00:08:31,232
But I'm not sick, right?

185
00:08:35,153 --> 00:08:36,937
Good point.

186
00:08:42,844 --> 00:08:44,729
I want my stuff, asshat.

187
00:08:44,796 --> 00:08:45,913
I told you, man,
I don't have it here.

188
00:08:45,964 --> 00:08:47,114
<i>Hey...</i>

189
00:08:47,165 --> 00:08:48,916
Guys.

190
00:08:48,967 --> 00:08:50,751
Everything okay?

191
00:08:50,802 --> 00:08:52,086
On my way out.

192
00:08:52,137 --> 00:08:54,305
I'll see you later.

193
00:09:01,146 --> 00:09:03,097
You wanna...
Tell me what's going on?

194
00:09:09,554 --> 00:09:11,972
My friend gave me some
leftover klonopin he had

195
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:14,492
when he switched
his seizure meds.

196
00:09:14,576 --> 00:09:16,177
I sold them to roid rage
for 80 bucks,

197
00:09:16,244 --> 00:09:18,245
but I landed in here
before I could deliver,

198
00:09:18,313 --> 00:09:20,614
and now he's gonna
rip my arms off.

199
00:09:20,665 --> 00:09:22,216
How often do you sell drugs?

200
00:09:22,284 --> 00:09:24,835
It was a one-time thing.

201
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:26,337
<i>I needed the cash,</i>
<i>I had the pills,</i>

202
00:09:26,405 --> 00:09:28,589
<i>so I thought, "why not?"</i>

203
00:09:28,656 --> 00:09:30,224
It was a bad idea.

204
00:09:32,327 --> 00:09:33,660
The pills are at my house.

205
00:09:33,712 --> 00:09:36,047
I could have a friend
go get them.

206
00:09:43,972 --> 00:09:47,108
Give the thug his money back.

207
00:09:49,111 --> 00:09:51,562
One time only.

208
00:09:55,817 --> 00:09:57,451
I mean,
if you're okay with this.

209
00:09:57,519 --> 00:09:59,120
You have three kids
of your own.

210
00:09:59,187 --> 00:10:00,521
It's not even a question.

211
00:10:00,572 --> 00:10:02,740
Of course I'll be
Rachel's guardian.

212
00:10:02,824 --> 00:10:04,075
And House is cool with this?

213
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:05,543
I mean, you guys...

214
00:10:05,627 --> 00:10:07,128
We've only been together
a few months.

215
00:10:07,195 --> 00:10:08,579
Hmm. Seems like
a lot longer.

216
00:10:08,663 --> 00:10:11,165
Probably because you've been
talking about him for ten years.

217
00:10:11,216 --> 00:10:12,800
And by talking,
I mean ranting about

218
00:10:12,868 --> 00:10:14,335
wanting to smash his teeth in

219
00:10:14,386 --> 00:10:17,037
with a stapler
for being such a jerk.

220
00:10:18,423 --> 00:10:20,691
People change.

221
00:10:24,813 --> 00:10:26,263
I'll get it.

222
00:10:26,348 --> 00:10:28,432
<i>That better be her!</i>

223
00:10:28,517 --> 00:10:31,268
Ooh!

224
00:10:31,353 --> 00:10:35,039
Rachel Cuddy, you were supposed
to be home half an hour ago.

225
00:10:35,107 --> 00:10:36,440
Don't blame me...
He's the one

226
00:10:36,525 --> 00:10:37,858
who wouldn't
run any red lights.

227
00:10:42,197 --> 00:10:43,414
Mouth on that kid

228
00:10:43,498 --> 00:10:47,017
makes Mel Gibson sound like
Nelson Mandela.

229
00:10:47,085 --> 00:10:48,068
Where'd she learn that?

230
00:10:52,374 --> 00:10:53,574
I don't know why you're here,

231
00:10:53,625 --> 00:10:55,092
but I didn't do it.

232
00:10:56,411 --> 00:10:58,095
What's the problem, officer?

233
00:10:58,180 --> 00:10:59,763
She was shoplifting
down at the mall.

234
00:10:59,831 --> 00:11:01,382
Aw!

235
00:11:01,433 --> 00:11:03,050
Are either of you
this girl's father?

236
00:11:03,101 --> 00:11:04,918
Nope. But since
her mom died,

237
00:11:04,970 --> 00:11:07,104
she's my favorite
tax write-off.

238
00:11:07,189 --> 00:11:09,923
Officer, you have my word
it won't happen again.

239
00:11:09,975 --> 00:11:11,392
'Cause next time...

240
00:11:11,443 --> 00:11:13,861
She won't get caught!

241
00:11:33,982 --> 00:11:37,001
It's no big deal.

242
00:11:37,085 --> 00:11:38,952
Good for you.

243
00:11:39,004 --> 00:11:41,071
You could have just
assumed he was a drug dealer,

244
00:11:41,139 --> 00:11:42,973
but instead you
took his word for it.

245
00:11:43,058 --> 00:11:44,975
<i>It's nice to finally</i>
<i>see someone</i>

246
00:11:45,043 --> 00:11:48,779
have a little faith
in humanity around here.

247
00:11:48,847 --> 00:11:50,981
Why would you do that?

248
00:11:53,401 --> 00:11:55,469
Ryan, you okay in there?
<i>I'm not sure.</i>

249
00:11:58,490 --> 00:12:00,875
I think I just peed blood.

250
00:12:07,186 --> 00:12:09,461
Looks like peeing blood
is the new black.

251
00:12:09,462 --> 00:12:11,496
<i>Peeing blood after a night</i>
<i>on antibiotics</i>

252
00:12:11,497 --> 00:12:13,224
means we can move on
from infections.

253
00:12:13,225 --> 00:12:14,919
Scoping showed no sign
of a bleed in his bladder,

254
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:17,321
which points to a kidney problem.
Probably some kinda mass.

255
00:12:17,388 --> 00:12:18,589
<i>Kidney mass wouldn't</i>
<i>explain the coughing blood</i>

256
00:12:18,656 --> 00:12:20,007
or the hemorrhages.

257
00:12:20,074 --> 00:12:21,658
Antiphospholipid syndrome,
on the other hand...

258
00:12:21,709 --> 00:12:24,444
Makes sense.
But doesn't rule out a mass.

259
00:12:24,512 --> 00:12:25,796
<i>You think it's cancer?</i>

260
00:12:25,847 --> 00:12:27,397
Mass doesn't have to be cancer.

261
00:12:27,465 --> 00:12:28,549
Could be renal hematoma.

262
00:12:28,633 --> 00:12:29,800
But the patient doesn't have

263
00:12:29,851 --> 00:12:32,169
any other abdominal trauma.
<i>He's...</i>

264
00:12:32,237 --> 00:12:33,554
Not talking about the patient.

265
00:12:35,557 --> 00:12:37,791
Cuddy has a mass on her kidney?

266
00:12:37,859 --> 00:12:39,142
It's probably
just a complex cyst

267
00:12:39,194 --> 00:12:41,845
or angiomyolipoma.

268
00:12:41,896 --> 00:12:43,230
It's a mass, not a mystery.

269
00:12:43,298 --> 00:12:46,316
They'll do the biopsy,
then you'll have your answer.

270
00:12:46,367 --> 00:12:48,735
Just...Have to wait.

271
00:12:50,288 --> 00:12:51,388
Patient admitted to using pot.

272
00:12:51,456 --> 00:12:53,207
Who knows what else he's doing.

273
00:12:53,291 --> 00:12:55,542
This could be
a heroin-induced nephropathy.

274
00:12:55,627 --> 00:12:57,144
I thought you trusted this kid.

275
00:12:57,212 --> 00:12:59,446
And then you pointed out
how sweet that was.

276
00:12:59,514 --> 00:13:01,215
<i>If it were heroin, he'd be</i>
<i>going through withdrawal.</i>

277
00:13:01,299 --> 00:13:03,199
Antiphospholipid syndrome's
a better fit.

278
00:13:03,251 --> 00:13:05,385
Start the patient
on plasmapheresis.

279
00:13:05,470 --> 00:13:06,703
While he's doing that,

280
00:13:06,754 --> 00:13:08,972
can I at least search
his house for drugs?

281
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:10,757
Have I ever said no
to that question?

282
00:13:14,796 --> 00:13:16,597
What are you doing here?

283
00:13:17,982 --> 00:13:19,299
Pie-eating contest.

284
00:13:19,367 --> 00:13:21,785
Cuddy's biopsy is in an hour.

285
00:13:21,853 --> 00:13:23,320
You should be
keeping her company.

286
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:28,742
<i>Okay. You've been worried</i>
<i>that your relationship</i>

287
00:13:28,826 --> 00:13:30,327
is getting in the way
of your diagnoses,

288
00:13:30,394 --> 00:13:31,578
you're protecting your patient.

289
00:13:31,663 --> 00:13:34,164
<i>Either that or...</i>
<i>You're an ass.</i>

290
00:13:34,231 --> 00:13:36,600
Three... I hate
the smell of death.

291
00:13:38,102 --> 00:13:40,671
The chances of Cuddy
having renal cell carcinoma...

292
00:13:40,738 --> 00:13:42,706
I'm talking about
our relationship.

293
00:13:42,774 --> 00:13:44,074
<i>She needs support and comfort,</i>

294
00:13:44,125 --> 00:13:45,959
both things
that I famously suck at.

295
00:13:46,044 --> 00:13:48,262
This will inevitably lead to...

296
00:13:48,346 --> 00:13:50,964
You know what's good
for that? Practice.

297
00:13:51,049 --> 00:13:53,967
Doing it... I don't know...
once?

298
00:13:54,052 --> 00:13:55,802
I'm not gonna act like
there's a crisis

299
00:13:55,887 --> 00:13:57,187
before we know there is one.

300
00:13:57,254 --> 00:13:58,922
There's no proof
there's anything wrong with her.

301
00:13:58,973 --> 00:14:00,440
There's no proof
she's being stalked

302
00:14:00,525 --> 00:14:01,909
by ninja squirrels either,

303
00:14:01,976 --> 00:14:03,777
but if she's scared of them...

304
00:14:03,861 --> 00:14:06,280
As her boyfriend,
it's your job to figure out

305
00:14:06,347 --> 00:14:08,465
how to help her feel better.

306
00:14:12,887 --> 00:14:14,855
You're right.

307
00:14:23,848 --> 00:14:26,333
House told me
to keep you company.

308
00:14:26,417 --> 00:14:28,835
Nurse told me to give you
antibiotics.

309
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:31,888
Tell House I'm fine.

310
00:14:33,958 --> 00:14:35,142
Mm!

311
00:14:38,129 --> 00:14:40,230
Tom Cruise got married.

312
00:14:48,940 --> 00:14:51,491
Do you want me to quote
from First Corinthians?

313
00:14:51,559 --> 00:14:53,994
'Cause I can do that.
<i>As a Jew,</i>

314
00:14:54,062 --> 00:14:55,746
I'm gonna have
to decline that offer.

315
00:14:55,813 --> 00:14:57,064
Don't know what you're missing.

316
00:14:57,131 --> 00:14:58,665
St. Paul
was really on his game.

317
00:15:03,955 --> 00:15:07,841
He'll show up eventually.

318
00:15:07,925 --> 00:15:10,544
You don't actually
believe that.

319
00:15:10,628 --> 00:15:12,462
But I do.

320
00:15:12,513 --> 00:15:13,847
All these years,

321
00:15:13,931 --> 00:15:15,465
he's never stopped
trying to annoy me

322
00:15:15,516 --> 00:15:17,884
for more than 15 minutes.

323
00:15:17,969 --> 00:15:20,804
And now he can't even
walk into the room.

324
00:15:23,675 --> 00:15:26,109
Love hopes all things.

325
00:15:29,347 --> 00:15:31,865
What is it with you
and this kid?

326
00:15:31,949 --> 00:15:34,117
He's doggy paddling
in a sea of misery.

327
00:15:34,185 --> 00:15:35,452
I remember what it's like.

328
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:37,404
How far did you have to
reach back for that memory,

329
00:15:37,488 --> 00:15:39,122
last night?

330
00:15:39,190 --> 00:15:40,957
Sometimes I hear you
in the living room

331
00:15:41,025 --> 00:15:42,376
watching TV
at 3:00 A.M.

332
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:44,861
That's when classic <i>Dr. Who</i>
comes on the BBC.

333
00:15:44,912 --> 00:15:46,997
Yeah. If only they had
some device

334
00:15:47,048 --> 00:15:48,364
that allowed you to record them

335
00:15:48,416 --> 00:15:50,000
and watch them another time.

336
00:15:50,051 --> 00:15:51,968
I'm just saying...

337
00:15:52,036 --> 00:15:54,704
I don't think fixing this kid
is gonna fix you.

338
00:15:54,756 --> 00:15:57,491
Yep?

339
00:15:57,558 --> 00:15:59,643
We're on our way back.

340
00:15:59,710 --> 00:16:02,045
Our patient lost all feeling
in his right arm.

341
00:16:02,096 --> 00:16:03,880
Look at this.

342
00:16:32,009 --> 00:16:35,429
Chase?

343
00:16:35,513 --> 00:16:38,215
How'd it go with Cuddy?

344
00:16:40,301 --> 00:16:41,268
Chase?

345
00:16:57,585 --> 00:16:58,819
Aah!

346
00:17:20,958 --> 00:17:23,343
Good thing
I brought my ax cane.

347
00:17:25,796 --> 00:17:27,630
<i>House...Help me!</i>

348
00:17:27,682 --> 00:17:29,733
I'm coming!

349
00:17:33,304 --> 00:17:35,071
<i>House...Please!</i>

350
00:17:38,642 --> 00:17:39,910
It looks like we got company.

351
00:17:58,713 --> 00:18:01,715
<i>House!</i>

352
00:18:01,799 --> 00:18:03,967
<i>Aah...Aah!</i>

353
00:18:07,104 --> 00:18:09,973
?
?

354
00:18:10,024 --> 00:18:11,841
<i>Aah...Aah!</i>

355
00:18:20,201 --> 00:18:21,318
No!

356
00:18:21,369 --> 00:18:22,285
Ah...

357
00:18:24,296 --> 00:18:26,580
Are you okay?

358
00:18:28,633 --> 00:18:29,967
I was sleeping.

359
00:18:30,051 --> 00:18:31,969
What could go wrong?

360
00:18:37,177 --> 00:18:38,494
<i>Patient lost feeling in his arm</i>

361
00:18:38,561 --> 00:18:41,062
<i>while on steroids...</i>
<i>Rules out autoimmune.</i>

362
00:18:41,063 --> 00:18:42,730
<i>So what causes bleeding,</i>
<i>kidney problems,</i>

363
00:18:42,781 --> 00:18:44,415
and unilateral numbness?

364
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:46,334
And a complete absence
of any record

365
00:18:46,401 --> 00:18:48,503
of Cuddy's kidney biopsy.

366
00:18:48,570 --> 00:18:50,421
She must have put it
under a false name

367
00:18:50,506 --> 00:18:52,423
so I couldn't rush the results.

368
00:18:52,508 --> 00:18:54,709
<i>What if we had it backwards</i>

369
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:56,677
and it's not a bleeding problem,
it's a clotting problem?

370
00:18:56,745 --> 00:18:59,213
There's no patient file
created in the last two days

371
00:18:59,264 --> 00:19:01,349
for anyone having
that procedure.

372
00:19:01,417 --> 00:19:02,467
<i>She backdated the file?</i>

373
00:19:02,551 --> 00:19:04,218
That's very clever.

374
00:19:04,269 --> 00:19:06,054
Hands off.
She's mine.

375
00:19:06,121 --> 00:19:07,205
<i>Clots could explain everything</i>

376
00:19:07,272 --> 00:19:08,506
including the numbness.

377
00:19:08,574 --> 00:19:10,257
We should do an angiogram
of his brain,

378
00:19:10,309 --> 00:19:12,259
<i>see if we can find it.</i>

379
00:19:15,881 --> 00:19:17,415
<i>House.</i>

380
00:19:17,483 --> 00:19:18,566
We're worried too.

381
00:19:19,868 --> 00:19:21,285
How sweet.

382
00:19:21,370 --> 00:19:22,787
I'm not worried.

383
00:19:22,871 --> 00:19:25,206
I just wanna get the results
so she can stop worrying.

384
00:19:25,273 --> 00:19:27,108
Okay, but in the meantime...
Do an angiogram.

385
00:19:27,159 --> 00:19:29,827
You two go to pathology
and look at Cuddy's slides.

386
00:19:29,912 --> 00:19:31,946
You just said you didn't know
which sample was hers.

387
00:19:31,997 --> 00:19:33,464
I guess you're gonna
have to look at them all.

388
00:19:37,619 --> 00:19:39,887
<i>Bigger question...</i>
<i>What's the deal with Taub?</i>

389
00:19:39,955 --> 00:19:42,289
Just because House
is too distracted

390
00:19:42,341 --> 00:19:44,425
to notice your distraction
doesn't mean we didn't.

391
00:19:44,476 --> 00:19:46,511
Clots, angiograms...
I'm focused.

392
00:19:46,595 --> 00:19:49,230
The kid scratched out
the faces of half his class.

393
00:19:49,297 --> 00:19:50,515
You don't think
that's a problem?

394
00:19:50,599 --> 00:19:51,732
It's not our problem.

395
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:53,184
Why is it anyone's problem?

396
00:19:53,268 --> 00:19:55,520
I violently executed
my tenth grade geometry teacher

397
00:19:55,604 --> 00:19:57,438
about five different ways
in my mind.

398
00:19:57,489 --> 00:19:58,773
I didn't want to kill anybody.

399
00:19:58,824 --> 00:20:01,642
I just wanted to torture
them slowly in my basement,

400
00:20:01,693 --> 00:20:03,111
preferably with acid.

401
00:20:05,164 --> 00:20:08,449
You guys ever think about
what you might to do to House?

402
00:20:15,290 --> 00:20:17,425
Maybe it's no big deal.

403
00:20:17,492 --> 00:20:19,010
Unless it is.

404
00:20:19,094 --> 00:20:21,429
Someone shot House.

405
00:20:31,306 --> 00:20:32,773
What are you doing?

406
00:20:32,841 --> 00:20:34,559
Pie-eating contest.

407
00:20:34,626 --> 00:20:37,478
I was going to send Chase

408
00:20:37,529 --> 00:20:39,897
to tell you what the obvious
right thing to do here is,

409
00:20:39,982 --> 00:20:41,482
but then I realized...

410
00:20:41,533 --> 00:20:44,068
If you were too stupid
to know how stupid that was,

411
00:20:44,136 --> 00:20:45,770
you might miss the irony.

412
00:20:45,838 --> 00:20:47,688
You have to be with her.

413
00:20:47,756 --> 00:20:49,790
Yeah. I get it.

414
00:20:49,858 --> 00:20:50,992
She needs artificial support

415
00:20:51,059 --> 00:20:52,743
for an artificial problem.

416
00:20:52,828 --> 00:20:56,097
She's fine.
Chase did an excellent job.

417
00:20:56,165 --> 00:20:58,049
She doesn't sleep with Chase.

418
00:20:58,133 --> 00:20:59,417
We don't know that.

419
00:20:59,501 --> 00:21:00,568
<i>Hey!</i>

420
00:21:00,636 --> 00:21:02,720
Eating pie in here.

421
00:21:02,804 --> 00:21:04,872
House...

422
00:21:04,923 --> 00:21:06,807
<i>I'm not gonna tell you</i>
<i>a third time.</i>

423
00:21:06,875 --> 00:21:08,209
Do not screw this up.

424
00:21:08,260 --> 00:21:11,378
Because I really don't
wanna clean up the mess.

425
00:21:13,215 --> 00:21:14,899
He's referring to the pie.

426
00:21:14,983 --> 00:21:16,734
<i>14 patients</i>
<i>with kidney biopsies.</i>

427
00:21:16,818 --> 00:21:20,655
I tabulated them against
their urinalysis results.

428
00:21:20,722 --> 00:21:22,573
<i>Six men, three diabetics,</i>

429
00:21:22,658 --> 00:21:24,525
<i>one LCDD, one kid, two seniors,</i>

430
00:21:24,576 --> 00:21:28,196
and by default,
one...Cuddy.

431
00:21:29,581 --> 00:21:32,617
Uh...The biopsy
was inconclusive.

432
00:21:32,701 --> 00:21:34,585
The mass is near
the center of her kidney.

433
00:21:34,653 --> 00:21:37,004
They couldn't get
a readable sample.

434
00:21:37,072 --> 00:21:39,257
Means they'll have to
remove the mass

435
00:21:39,341 --> 00:21:41,259
to know if it's cancer or not.

436
00:21:41,326 --> 00:21:42,677
<i>The file says</i>

437
00:21:42,744 --> 00:21:44,095
they're doing some imaging now,

438
00:21:44,179 --> 00:21:46,998
give the surgeon a better
idea of what he's dealing with.

439
00:21:54,339 --> 00:21:56,090
<i>Can we order pizza?</i>

440
00:21:56,141 --> 00:21:58,209
There's nothing in the fridge.

441
00:21:58,277 --> 00:22:00,194
At least not anymore.

442
00:22:00,262 --> 00:22:03,231
What's happening
with the patient?

443
00:22:03,282 --> 00:22:04,565
Angio showed a clot

444
00:22:04,616 --> 00:22:06,567
in a branch of his
middle cerebral artery.

445
00:22:06,618 --> 00:22:09,820
Started him on streptokinase
to break it up.

446
00:22:09,905 --> 00:22:13,440
Although...Maybe we should
have just played a few rounds

447
00:22:13,492 --> 00:22:16,160
of <i>Savagescape 2: The Revenge</i>,
<i>because that's obviously</i>

448
00:22:16,245 --> 00:22:17,845
the best way to make someone
feel better.

449
00:22:17,913 --> 00:22:21,182
You keep talking like Wilson,
your face will freeze like that.

450
00:22:21,250 --> 00:22:24,001
Look, however bad you think
you're gonna be in that room,

451
00:22:24,086 --> 00:22:26,737
not being in the room is worse.

452
00:22:31,793 --> 00:22:33,644
When she breaks up with you...

453
00:22:33,729 --> 00:22:36,063
You're playing by yourself.

454
00:22:40,319 --> 00:22:41,902
Honey, I'm home.

455
00:22:41,970 --> 00:22:44,855
Just in time.
Pot roast is ready.

456
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:46,991
Smells wonderful!

457
00:22:47,075 --> 00:22:48,475
I cured all my patients,

458
00:22:48,527 --> 00:22:50,661
so I came home to spend
time with Rachel.

459
00:22:50,746 --> 00:22:52,780
And how was your day today?

460
00:22:52,831 --> 00:22:54,065
It was great, ma!

461
00:22:54,132 --> 00:22:56,150
I got 100% on my spelling test

462
00:22:56,201 --> 00:22:58,536
and 170 on my LSATs!

463
00:22:58,620 --> 00:23:01,422
Your LSATs?
You're eight years old.

464
00:23:01,489 --> 00:23:02,957
We've been studying together.

465
00:23:03,008 --> 00:23:05,676
It was supposed to be
a surprise.

466
00:23:05,761 --> 00:23:08,846
Well, that's wonderful.

467
00:23:08,930 --> 00:23:10,214
<i>I think Rachel</i>

468
00:23:10,299 --> 00:23:11,599
deserves a treat.

469
00:23:11,666 --> 00:23:12,850
No, thanks, daddy.

470
00:23:12,934 --> 00:23:14,852
It might spoil my appetite.

471
00:23:16,271 --> 00:23:18,339
Well, who could that be?

472
00:23:20,976 --> 00:23:23,110
Delivery for you,
Mrs. House.

473
00:23:23,178 --> 00:23:25,346
Happy 29th birthday.

474
00:23:25,397 --> 00:23:27,982
I'm not 29!

475
00:23:29,618 --> 00:23:31,686
You're not limping.

476
00:23:33,521 --> 00:23:36,073
This isn't possible.

477
00:23:36,158 --> 00:23:39,577
None of this is possible.

478
00:23:39,661 --> 00:23:42,246
Girl can dream.

479
00:23:52,674 --> 00:23:54,975
You run out of sugar?

480
00:23:56,544 --> 00:23:59,964
Got your scans back from today.

481
00:24:16,114 --> 00:24:17,915
Yeah.

482
00:24:26,174 --> 00:24:27,591
Okay.

483
00:24:30,395 --> 00:24:32,613
What's going on?

484
00:24:35,750 --> 00:24:38,085
Imaging shows enhancing masses

485
00:24:38,136 --> 00:24:40,971
across multiple lobes
of Cuddy's lungs.

486
00:24:43,859 --> 00:24:47,044
That's what kidney cancer
looks like when it metastasizes.

487
00:24:51,083 --> 00:24:53,100
She's dead.

488
00:24:58,352 --> 00:24:59,853
What's up, losers?

489
00:24:59,904 --> 00:25:01,988
I hope you're enjoying
being alive.

490
00:25:02,056 --> 00:25:04,190
Today's lesson:
Natural selection.

491
00:25:04,241 --> 00:25:06,660
Excellent system.
Made us who we are today.

492
00:25:06,727 --> 00:25:09,112
But then we invented seat belts
and grocery stores,

493
00:25:09,196 --> 00:25:11,748
things that keep idiots
and weaklings alive.

494
00:25:11,832 --> 00:25:13,667
And let's be honest.

495
00:25:13,734 --> 00:25:15,669
Most of you
don't really deserve it.

496
00:25:18,456 --> 00:25:20,624
Here's to the natural order.

497
00:25:27,882 --> 00:25:28,932
Yes!

498
00:25:29,016 --> 00:25:32,102
<i>Whoo!</i>

499
00:25:32,186 --> 00:25:33,853
Copied from his flash drive.

500
00:25:33,921 --> 00:25:36,106
Do I go to the cops?

501
00:25:36,190 --> 00:25:38,458
Yes. "Officer, I'd like
to report an assault.

502
00:25:38,526 --> 00:25:41,144
The victim
was a pile of leaves."

503
00:25:41,212 --> 00:25:42,479
It goes on.

504
00:25:42,563 --> 00:25:43,880
He talks about
bombing his school.

505
00:25:43,948 --> 00:25:45,715
Which you know because
you stole his flash drive

506
00:25:45,783 --> 00:25:47,384
and broke into his house.

507
00:25:47,451 --> 00:25:49,435
How's that gonna play?

508
00:25:49,487 --> 00:25:51,655
<i>Ryan's not responding to streptokinase.</i>

509
00:25:51,739 --> 00:25:53,406
We don't have very long
before the damage

510
00:25:53,457 --> 00:25:54,958
becomes irreversible.

511
00:25:55,042 --> 00:25:56,326
So we either up his dosage

512
00:25:56,410 --> 00:25:58,461
or go into his head
and get the clot out.

513
00:25:58,546 --> 00:26:00,046
<i>Where's House?</i>
<i>Hopefully with Cuddy.</i>

514
00:26:00,114 --> 00:26:02,165
She did just get
some pretty awful news.

515
00:26:02,233 --> 00:26:03,450
I called her.

516
00:26:03,517 --> 00:26:05,435
She doesn't know
where he is either.

517
00:26:10,758 --> 00:26:12,525
Have you seen House?

518
00:26:12,593 --> 00:26:14,060
No.

519
00:26:16,296 --> 00:26:18,932
He left my place
last night after you called.

520
00:26:18,983 --> 00:26:20,433
No one's seen him today.

521
00:26:20,484 --> 00:26:22,435
Any idea where he'd be?

522
00:26:22,503 --> 00:26:24,604
No.

523
00:26:26,023 --> 00:26:28,158
And you're not...
Worried about that?

524
00:26:28,242 --> 00:26:30,410
He's not good with bad news.

525
00:26:30,478 --> 00:26:32,495
Yes. I'm worried.

526
00:26:32,563 --> 00:26:34,447
But this isn't about House.
It's about Cuddy.

527
00:26:34,498 --> 00:26:36,082
She's the one
who could be dying,

528
00:26:36,150 --> 00:26:37,667
and he's trying to
make this about himself.

529
00:26:37,752 --> 00:26:39,536
I'm not playing.

530
00:26:39,620 --> 00:26:41,254
Okay...

531
00:26:43,974 --> 00:26:46,543
She still believes
he'll show up.

532
00:26:48,045 --> 00:26:49,312
He'll either get over himself

533
00:26:49,380 --> 00:26:52,599
and be who she needs him to be

534
00:26:52,666 --> 00:26:55,985
or he won't.

535
00:26:57,555 --> 00:26:59,172
We'd like to do an embolectomy.

536
00:26:59,223 --> 00:27:01,941
We'll run a corkscrew-shaped
instrument into Ryan's brain

537
00:27:02,009 --> 00:27:05,478
<i>and pull the clot out.</i>

538
00:27:05,529 --> 00:27:07,063
Okay.

539
00:27:07,131 --> 00:27:08,314
<i>Have you talked</i>
<i>to him about it?</i>

540
00:27:08,365 --> 00:27:11,618
Yes. But I wanted
to see you alone.

541
00:27:11,685 --> 00:27:14,687
I saw some videos that Ryan
made a few weeks ago.

542
00:27:14,739 --> 00:27:16,873
He's blowing up pipe bombs

543
00:27:16,957 --> 00:27:19,125
and threatening people
in his school.

544
00:27:19,193 --> 00:27:20,243
<i>Oh, God!</i>

545
00:27:20,327 --> 00:27:21,360
He was probably
just messing around.

546
00:27:21,412 --> 00:27:22,361
Our son wouldn't hurt anybody.

547
00:27:22,413 --> 00:27:24,080
I'm not so sure.

548
00:27:24,165 --> 00:27:25,665
<i>I know this looks bad,</i>

549
00:27:25,716 --> 00:27:27,533
but Ryan's a good kid.

550
00:27:27,585 --> 00:27:30,520
He's had a rough couple years
since he started high school,

551
00:27:30,588 --> 00:27:32,038
but I really think
he'll come out of it.

552
00:27:32,106 --> 00:27:33,590
He needs help.
Maybe he does,

553
00:27:33,674 --> 00:27:35,725
but if this gets out,
he'll be suspended,

554
00:27:35,810 --> 00:27:37,710
maybe expelled.

555
00:27:37,762 --> 00:27:40,163
How about you focus
on keeping him alive?

556
00:27:40,231 --> 00:27:42,215
What are you gonna do?

557
00:27:42,283 --> 00:27:43,817
What do you think I should do?

558
00:27:43,884 --> 00:27:45,051
Pssh. Ha.

559
00:27:45,102 --> 00:27:46,302
So you can do the opposite?

560
00:27:46,370 --> 00:27:48,688
There are kids
all over the country

561
00:27:48,756 --> 00:27:50,907
doing dumb,
potentially violent things,

562
00:27:50,991 --> 00:27:53,927
but the percentage of them
who would actually kill anybody

563
00:27:53,994 --> 00:27:55,245
is miniscule.

564
00:27:55,329 --> 00:27:56,963
So I shouldn't do anything.

565
00:27:57,031 --> 00:27:58,965
Mm...While the odds
are low,

566
00:27:59,033 --> 00:28:01,584
the fallout could be...
Huge.

567
00:28:01,669 --> 00:28:03,569
Tens or even hundreds of lives.

568
00:28:03,621 --> 00:28:05,922
So I should call the cops.

569
00:28:06,006 --> 00:28:07,907
Of course, over-identification
with the subject

570
00:28:07,958 --> 00:28:11,394
could skew the calculation
towards being extra-protective.

571
00:28:11,462 --> 00:28:13,296
Or alternatively...

572
00:28:13,364 --> 00:28:15,832
You suck at this.

573
00:28:19,303 --> 00:28:21,137
Hate the statistics...

574
00:28:21,222 --> 00:28:22,972
Not the statistician.

575
00:28:27,311 --> 00:28:29,562
Give me a little more dye.

576
00:28:32,566 --> 00:28:33,766
<i>There's the clot.</i>

577
00:28:38,939 --> 00:28:41,274
It just disintegrated
when you touched it.

578
00:28:42,609 --> 00:28:44,460
What was that thing?

579
00:28:57,758 --> 00:28:59,642
I got a great idea
where we should go.

580
00:28:59,710 --> 00:29:00,894
I don't want to hear it.

581
00:29:00,961 --> 00:29:03,146
You're gonna love it.

582
00:29:03,230 --> 00:29:04,898
Australia's finest.

583
00:29:04,965 --> 00:29:07,317
There's a great karaoke
bar in Newark...

584
00:29:07,401 --> 00:29:09,018
I hate karaoke.

585
00:29:09,103 --> 00:29:12,471
They got every...
every song

586
00:29:12,523 --> 00:29:14,858
by every Aussie artist.

587
00:29:14,942 --> 00:29:18,661
Midnight oil, men at work,
Olivia Newton John.

588
00:29:18,746 --> 00:29:20,997
I do a mean version
of <i>Physical.</i>

589
00:29:21,081 --> 00:29:23,416
And the barbecue shrimp
is amazing.

590
00:29:26,036 --> 00:29:27,820
What about the fries?

591
00:29:27,872 --> 00:29:30,790
Hot and salty and delicious.

592
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:41,684
Talking about food
made me hungry.

593
00:29:43,137 --> 00:29:46,222
You had candy
in my other dreams.

594
00:29:46,307 --> 00:29:48,641
Means you're stressed at work.

595
00:29:48,692 --> 00:29:51,277
All dream symbols
mean you're stressed at work.

596
00:29:51,345 --> 00:29:53,179
Or castration anxiety.

597
00:29:53,230 --> 00:29:54,781
No.

598
00:29:54,848 --> 00:29:57,567
I was hoping...

599
00:29:57,651 --> 00:30:00,519
You'd figure out a way
to handle all this.

600
00:30:02,740 --> 00:30:06,576
Maybe you can't because
you're still a child.

601
00:30:06,660 --> 00:30:09,295
I can do better.

602
00:30:15,970 --> 00:30:18,054
Might be too late.

603
00:30:25,312 --> 00:30:26,396
House!

604
00:30:29,233 --> 00:30:30,400
Ah...

605
00:30:54,692 --> 00:30:56,893
I should have been here.

606
00:30:59,546 --> 00:31:01,347
Sorry.

607
00:31:06,353 --> 00:31:08,571
I knew you'd come.

608
00:31:15,525 --> 00:31:16,525
What was that thing,

609
00:31:16,609 --> 00:31:18,660
<i>and why did it just dissolve</i>

610
00:31:18,745 --> 00:31:20,028
<i>in the middle of surgery?</i>

611
00:31:20,113 --> 00:31:21,280
<i>Why is his liver shutting down?</i>

612
00:31:21,331 --> 00:31:22,331
That thing
in his brain goes away,

613
00:31:22,415 --> 00:31:23,815
the kid slips into a coma.

614
00:31:23,867 --> 00:31:25,083
We started him on lactulose,

615
00:31:25,151 --> 00:31:27,035
but at the rate
his liver function is declining,

616
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:28,504
he'll be dead in a day.

617
00:31:28,588 --> 00:31:30,873
Should we page House?

618
00:31:30,957 --> 00:31:32,124
He's busy.

619
00:31:36,463 --> 00:31:38,464
House can't do anything for her now.

620
00:31:38,515 --> 00:31:40,665
We need him!
By his own logic...

621
00:31:40,717 --> 00:31:42,267
<i>Patient's blood tests were negative</i>

622
00:31:42,335 --> 00:31:44,770
for barbiturates
or acetaminophen.

623
00:31:44,837 --> 00:31:46,555
He's not on
a high protein diet.

624
00:31:46,639 --> 00:31:48,807
House couldn't concentrate on
the case before she was dying.

625
00:31:48,858 --> 00:31:51,143
You think he's gonna
get in the game now?

626
00:31:52,612 --> 00:31:54,196
If you don't make it,

627
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:56,114
I won't sleep with anyone
for at least a month.

628
00:31:56,182 --> 00:31:57,649
Make it two.

629
00:31:57,700 --> 00:31:59,485
Bitch.

630
00:32:02,655 --> 00:32:05,491
A.I.P. can cause uremia, tank the liver.

631
00:32:05,542 --> 00:32:08,126
It causes abdominal cramping,
not abdominal bleeding.

632
00:32:08,194 --> 00:32:10,529
Oh, because fucosidosis
was such a brilliant idea?

633
00:32:10,580 --> 00:32:12,531
Guys!

634
00:32:14,250 --> 00:32:16,919
Type 2 citrullinemia fits.

635
00:32:17,003 --> 00:32:19,087
There are no signs of hyperlipidemia

636
00:32:19,172 --> 00:32:21,706
or pancreatitis.
Those can take years to emerge.

637
00:32:21,758 --> 00:32:22,808
Closest we've gotten.

638
00:32:22,875 --> 00:32:24,226
Start him on IV sodium benzoate

639
00:32:24,310 --> 00:32:26,562
<i>to reduce the ammonia</i>
<i>levels in his blood.</i>

640
00:32:26,646 --> 00:32:29,147
Run a genetic test
for citrullinemia.

641
00:32:43,112 --> 00:32:44,413
Forget your troubles.

642
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:45,864
Forget your troubles.

643
00:32:45,915 --> 00:32:47,549
? Forget your troubles ?

644
00:32:47,617 --> 00:32:50,202
? come on, get happy ?

645
00:32:50,253 --> 00:32:51,620
Forget your troubles.

646
00:32:51,704 --> 00:32:55,424
? You better chase
all your cares away ?

647
00:32:57,243 --> 00:32:58,577
? shout hallelujah ?

648
00:32:58,628 --> 00:33:00,796

656
00:33:25,455 --> 00:33:27,772
? across the river ?

657
00:33:27,824 --> 00:33:30,709
? wash your sins in the tide ?

658
00:33:30,776 --> 00:33:34,779
? it's all so peaceful ?

659
00:33:34,831 --> 00:33:37,833
? on the other side ?

660
00:33:37,917 --> 00:33:41,136

00:33:41,220 --> 00:33:43,955

Get happy.
Get ready. Get ready.

675
00:34:19,175 --> 00:34:20,709
Get happy.
Get happy.

676
00:34:20,793 --> 00:34:22,511
Get ready, get ready.

677
00:34:22,595 --> 00:34:24,162
Get happy.

678
00:34:24,213 --> 00:34:26,548
Get ready!
Happy!

679
00:34:26,633 --> 00:34:28,467
Get ready.

00:35:07,623 --> 00:35:09,925

? get ready for the judgment ?

694
00:35:11,310 --> 00:35:12,811
? ready for the judgment ?

695
00:35:12,878 --> 00:35:14,396
? ready for the judgment ?

696
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:15,747
? ready for the judgment ?

697
00:35:15,815 --> 00:35:16,682
? ready for the... ?

698
00:35:37,437 --> 00:35:38,687
Hm.

699
00:35:38,755 --> 00:35:39,688
Hi.

700
00:35:39,756 --> 00:35:40,605
Hi.

701
00:35:48,247 --> 00:35:51,133
Guess who doesn't have cancer?

702
00:35:51,217 --> 00:35:53,084
Me.

703
00:35:53,136 --> 00:35:55,520
Also you.

704
00:35:55,588 --> 00:35:56,688
Actually, you for sure.
Me...

705
00:35:56,756 --> 00:35:58,590
House.

706
00:35:58,658 --> 00:36:00,709
Your tumor was benign.

707
00:36:00,777 --> 00:36:03,078
An oncocytoma.

708
00:36:03,146 --> 00:36:04,946
They cut it out.
You'll be fine.

709
00:36:08,217 --> 00:36:09,568
Then what was in my lungs?

710
00:36:09,619 --> 00:36:11,770
Once they ruled out cancer,

711
00:36:11,838 --> 00:36:14,606
I remembered that your mom
was allergic to antibiotics.

712
00:36:14,657 --> 00:36:16,074
So I had them test your blood,

713
00:36:16,125 --> 00:36:17,976
and your IGE levels
were through the roof.

714
00:36:18,044 --> 00:36:20,829
Because the lung masses
were an allergic reaction.

715
00:36:20,913 --> 00:36:22,898
So now you're off
the antibiotics,

716
00:36:22,965 --> 00:36:24,900
your lungs
should clear right up.

717
00:36:29,255 --> 00:36:31,306
I brought you something.

718
00:36:33,142 --> 00:36:34,176
Say hello to your tumor.

719
00:36:34,260 --> 00:36:35,393
Ugh!

720
00:36:35,461 --> 00:36:36,728
Wait.

721
00:36:48,307 --> 00:36:50,208
There are so many things
that I could be afraid of,

722
00:36:50,276 --> 00:36:52,794
and most of the time,
I manage to...

723
00:36:52,862 --> 00:36:55,797
Lock them up behind doors.

724
00:36:55,865 --> 00:36:59,651
But this happens...

725
00:36:59,719 --> 00:37:02,170
All those doors
just burst open.

726
00:37:11,681 --> 00:37:14,516
You just figured something out
about your patient, didn't you?

727
00:37:16,619 --> 00:37:18,420
Go. Do what you do.

728
00:37:24,459 --> 00:37:26,279
Take him off the meds.

729
00:37:26,633 --> 00:37:27,954
<i>He's got a staph infection.</i>

730
00:37:27,955 --> 00:37:29,388
You treated him for
staph three days ago.

731
00:37:29,456 --> 00:37:30,689
It didn't work.

732
00:37:30,757 --> 00:37:32,641
<i>Bacteria already</i>
<i>in his system responded.</i>

733
00:37:32,709 --> 00:37:35,377
Once a door's been busted open,
more just keep coming.

734
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:38,714
Oh! He's talking about
an abscess.

735
00:37:38,782 --> 00:37:40,199
I got that.

736
00:37:40,266 --> 00:37:42,134
<i>For the cheap seats,</i>

737
00:37:42,202 --> 00:37:46,104
an abscess is a gooey
little cream puff of infection.

738
00:37:46,156 --> 00:37:49,822
Probably burst when your
little pride and homicidal joy

739
00:37:49,823 --> 00:37:50,757
took a hard foul.

740
00:37:51,749 --> 00:37:53,066
It's good news.

741
00:37:53,134 --> 00:37:54,618
If we can find the door.

742
00:37:58,055 --> 00:37:59,889
I think I know where it is.

743
00:38:02,293 --> 00:38:05,729
What if...These aren't
from skateboarding?

744
00:38:05,796 --> 00:38:07,514
The kid has been blowing up

745
00:38:07,598 --> 00:38:09,065
PVC pipe bombs.

746
00:38:09,133 --> 00:38:10,800
If he got hit by shrapnel,

747
00:38:10,851 --> 00:38:12,852
the body walls off
the foreign object,

748
00:38:12,937 --> 00:38:14,354
which, because it's plastic,

749
00:38:14,438 --> 00:38:16,156
doesn't show up on imaging

750
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:17,974
and provides a perfect home
for bacteria.

751
00:38:18,025 --> 00:38:19,793
Antibiotics
attacked the infection,

752
00:38:19,860 --> 00:38:21,311
causing pieces to break off.

753
00:38:21,362 --> 00:38:22,812
Some hit the liver.

754
00:38:22,863 --> 00:38:24,314
One lodged in his brain
and dissolved

755
00:38:24,365 --> 00:38:25,749
when Foreman touched it.

756
00:38:25,816 --> 00:38:28,034
Once we drain the abscess
and remove the shrapnel,

757
00:38:28,119 --> 00:38:30,287
the antibiotics
can do their job.

758
00:38:30,338 --> 00:38:31,871
He'll be fine.

759
00:38:33,874 --> 00:38:37,210
Which just leaves...
What are you gonna do now?

760
00:38:40,381 --> 00:38:41,598
All right.

761
00:38:41,666 --> 00:38:44,334
I put the rest of the soup
in the freezer

762
00:38:44,385 --> 00:38:46,336
so you'll have some for later.

763
00:38:47,805 --> 00:38:50,023
Thanks for everything.
Yeah.

764
00:38:50,107 --> 00:38:51,941
Here you go.
I got it.

765
00:38:52,009 --> 00:38:53,693
Okay.

766
00:38:53,778 --> 00:38:56,696
Are you gonna tell mom?

767
00:38:56,781 --> 00:38:59,149
So she can show up here
to take care of you

768
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:03,186
by harassing the housekeeper
and criticizing your bathrobe?

769
00:39:03,254 --> 00:39:05,905
Yeah. I think I'm gonna
wait a few years.

770
00:39:10,328 --> 00:39:11,961
Oh, and I moved
your sleeping pills

771
00:39:12,029 --> 00:39:14,831
back in the medicine cabinet
because I just worry.

772
00:39:14,882 --> 00:39:16,750
Rachel always calls them candy.

773
00:39:27,428 --> 00:39:29,979
You took Vicodin.

774
00:39:33,517 --> 00:39:36,202
When you came
to my hospital room that night,

775
00:39:36,270 --> 00:39:39,022
you were stoned.

776
00:39:48,416 --> 00:39:51,284
How did you know?

777
00:39:54,922 --> 00:39:57,507
How did I not know?

778
00:39:57,574 --> 00:39:59,442
How did I make myself
forget for months

779
00:39:59,510 --> 00:40:01,294
that you're an addict?

780
00:40:03,547 --> 00:40:05,799
My subconscious
was trying to tell me

781
00:40:05,866 --> 00:40:08,251
you could never get
through this without drugs.

782
00:40:11,939 --> 00:40:13,857
It was a one-time thing.

783
00:40:13,924 --> 00:40:15,675
It's not about
the pills, House.

784
00:40:15,743 --> 00:40:17,694
It's about what they mean.

785
00:40:17,761 --> 00:40:19,896
I was scared because I thought

786
00:40:19,947 --> 00:40:21,931
my girlfriend might die.

787
00:40:21,982 --> 00:40:23,533
No.

788
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:26,319
You don't take Vicodin
because you're scared.

789
00:40:26,404 --> 00:40:28,204
You take it
so you won't feel pain.

790
00:40:28,272 --> 00:40:30,623
Everything you've ever done
is to avoid pain...

791
00:40:30,708 --> 00:40:32,108
drugs, sarcasm...

792
00:40:32,159 --> 00:40:34,127
Keeping everybody
at arm's length

793
00:40:34,211 --> 00:40:35,745
so no one can hurt you.

794
00:40:35,796 --> 00:40:37,497
As opposed to everyone else
in the world

795
00:40:37,581 --> 00:40:40,450
who goes looking for pain
like it's buried treasure?

796
00:40:42,470 --> 00:40:46,473
Pain happens when you care.

797
00:40:46,540 --> 00:40:48,324
Y-you can't love someone

798
00:40:48,392 --> 00:40:52,846
without making yourself open
to their problems,

799
00:40:52,930 --> 00:40:55,515
their fears.

800
00:40:55,599 --> 00:40:57,684
And you're not willing
to do that.

801
00:40:57,768 --> 00:40:59,936
I ca... I came
to be with you.

802
00:40:59,987 --> 00:41:02,522
But you weren't with me,
not really.

803
00:41:04,492 --> 00:41:07,694
I wanted to be.

804
00:41:09,730 --> 00:41:11,598
That's not enough.

805
00:41:16,921 --> 00:41:20,089
I can do better.

806
00:41:23,544 --> 00:41:26,379
I don't think you can.

807
00:41:31,135 --> 00:41:33,102
You'll choose yourself
over everybody else

808
00:41:33,170 --> 00:41:34,637
over and over again,

809
00:41:34,705 --> 00:41:36,389
because that's just
who you are.

810
00:41:44,899 --> 00:41:46,566
I'm sorry.

811
00:41:46,650 --> 00:41:48,485
No. No, no, no.
Don't.

812
00:41:48,536 --> 00:41:50,537
Don't.
I thought I could do this.

813
00:41:50,621 --> 00:41:52,188
Don't.
Please don't.

814
00:41:57,244 --> 00:41:58,912
Good-bye, House.

815
