If you're going to dress
like an Italian hooker,

7
00:00:15,389 --> 00:00:18,724
at least let it be
this year's Italian hooker.

8
00:00:18,792 --> 00:00:20,259
She's not telling us
we look fat.

9
00:00:20,327 --> 00:00:21,527
That's a major
breakthrough.

10
00:00:21,595 --> 00:00:22,828
If you didn't want
to be insulted,

11
00:00:22,896 --> 00:00:24,230
you wouldn't have invited me.

12
00:00:24,297 --> 00:00:25,832
Would anyone like
some champagne?

13
00:00:25,864 --> 00:00:27,533
- No.
- Yes, three glasses, please.

Yeah, it's not-- it's not even lunch.

I'll make it a mimosa.

My heart's doing
that weird thing again.

That's normal for humans.

- Borderline,

46
00:01:56,125 --> 00:01:57,759
which is the lab equivalent
of imaginary,

47
00:01:57,827 --> 00:01:59,227
which, by the way,
matches the rest

48

of her medical history.

49
00:02:00,763 --> 00:02:02,898
You really think
she's psyching herself

50
00:02:02,965 --> 00:02:05,600
into atrial fibrillation?
- So get her a cardiologist.

51
00:02:05,668 --> 00:02:07,102
You don't want me

I will follow up
later today.

64
00:02:35,127 --> 00:02:36,294

to my other symptoms?

65
00:02:36,361 --> 00:02:39,397

We're looking for a disease that

X-rays, and MRIs.

83
00:03:24,009 --> 00:03:26,010
Well, one thing does
pop to mind.

84
00:03:26,078 --> 00:03:27,278
We'll monitor you,

85
00:03:27,346 --> 00:03:28,946

a thyroid test.

86

Cuddy's high-school yearbook?

92
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,421
Okay, that is clearly
not related to the case.

93
00:03:45,488 --> 00:03:46,589
There is no case.

94
00:03:46,656 --> 00:03:48,991
Cuddy won't let House
see the yearbook,

95
00:03:49,059 --> 00:03:50,392
<i>so he figures</i>
<i>there's something to hide.</i>

96
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:52,628
Any guesses?
It's clearly related

97
00:03:52,696 --> 00:03:55,397
to being a giant
teenage dork.

98
00:03:55,465 --> 00:03:57,299
So you thought I'd have
some insights.

99
00:03:57,367 --> 00:03:58,634
Oh, no, no.

100
00:03:58,702 --> 00:03:59,835
- I didn't mean.
- Relax.

103
00:04:03,607 --> 00:04:06,242
I'm sure
you can relate...

104
00:04:06,309 --> 00:04:09,511
Because you knew
some dorks.

105
00:04:09,579 --> 00:04:12,414
I was the class president

106

Oh...

108
00:04:18,088 --> 00:04:19,688
Is that--
is that Cuddy's mom?

109
00:04:19,756 --> 00:04:21,857
Certain parts of her...

110
00:04:21,925 --> 00:04:26,462
And certain parts of some
muscular Hispanic gentleman.

111
00:04:26,529 --> 00:04:27,796
Should we consider STDs?

112
00:04:27,864 --> 00:04:29,865
I think I just caught one
looking at these photos.

113
00:04:29,933 --> 00:04:32,835
What does "azarcon" mean?

114
00:04:32,902 --> 00:04:34,436
I--

115
00:04:34,504 --> 00:04:37,873
it means we might have
an actual case.

Mexican herbal medication
for stomach problems,

117
00:04:40,777 --> 00:04:43,178
but only in the sense
that lead chromate is an herb

118
00:04:43,246 --> 00:04:44,413
and poison
is a medication.

119
00:04:44,481 --> 00:04:47,182
I'll start a chelation I.V.
Thank you so much.

120

You know...

122
00:04:52,222 --> 00:04:54,757
That's not the only thing
they found in her home.

123
00:04:54,824 --> 00:04:57,092

124
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:58,694
Nope.

125
00:04:58,762 --> 00:05:00,095

severe nausea and permanent
erectile dysfunction...

127
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:06,669
And which proves that
your mom is doing the help.

128
00:05:06,736 --> 00:05:11,106
According to her diary, it's
some contractor named Jesus...

129
00:05:11,174 --> 00:05:14,910
Which, granted, was originally
a Jewish name, but...

130

Mom...

136
00:05:35,999 --> 00:05:38,100
Just for medical reasons,
you should have told me.

137

If you're sexually active--

138
00:05:39,436 --> 00:05:43,772
at my age, he's more
the active one.

lousy advice about it

Hold on.
Five years?

- Why didn't you tell me about it?
- I don't know.

150

We don't have
that kind of relationship.

00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:12,601
Does that really
surprise you?

152
00:06:17,774 --> 00:06:20,809
You said you had two guys
helping you move.

out of work.

00:06:29,319 --> 00:06:31,587
I'm sorry. I just wanted
to drop off some mail

158
00:06:31,654 --> 00:06:32,988
and talk to you
about something.

159
00:06:33,056 --> 00:06:34,423

What does that mean?

164
00:06:56,609 --> 00:07:00,112
Have you moved on?

With who?
Is it Phil?

166
00:07:01,815 --> 00:07:03,282
I don't want to talk
about this.

167
00:07:03,349 --> 00:07:06,718
I know that you're worried
about money.

168
00:07:06,786 --> 00:07:09,021
- You're trying to change the subject.
- Yeah,

169

which you
could have gleaned

170
00:07:10,623 --> 00:07:12,224
from, "I don't want to talk
about this."

171
00:07:12,292 --> 00:07:14,760
I got you a tryout

consultant on lawsuits.

173

Have you completely forgotten
the last time I saw him?

175
00:07:23,736 --> 00:07:26,004
That was five years ago.

176
00:07:26,072 --> 00:07:28,073
Jamie had just found out
that you'd been cheating on me

177
00:07:28,141 --> 00:07:29,508
<i>with your partner's</i>
<i>daughter.</i>

178
00:07:29,576 --> 00:07:30,943
It's a little overreaction.
My--

179
00:07:31,010 --> 00:07:32,945
he broke my nose
and then called me

180
00:07:33,012 --> 00:07:36,014
the most horrible person
he's ever met.

181
00:07:36,082 --> 00:07:40,219
He shouldn't have broken
your nose.

182
00:08:00,306 --> 00:08:04,176
You know, texts,
calls, and emails

183
00:08:04,244 --> 00:08:06,311
all go to the same magic device
these days.

184
00:08:06,379 --> 00:08:07,980
You only got to send one.

185
00:08:08,047 --> 00:08:09,681
Then it's even weirder

186
00:08:09,749 --> 00:08:11,617
it took you so long
to get down here.

187
00:08:11,684 --> 00:08:14,520
Yeah, that's
a crazy mystery.

188
00:08:14,587 --> 00:08:16,488
It's not like I got
a department to run.

189
00:08:19,225 --> 00:08:21,793
This other magic device
tells me that lead poisoning

190
00:08:21,861 --> 00:08:24,897
wouldn't cause all my symptoms.
True.

191
00:08:24,964 --> 00:08:30,068
But it could cause
the 5% that are real.

192
00:08:30,136 --> 00:08:32,638
You think
I'm a hypochondriac?

193
00:08:32,705 --> 00:08:35,107
Well, let me answer this way--
maybe you're imagining

194
00:08:35,175 --> 00:08:36,909
that I think
you're a hypochondriac.

195
00:08:36,976 --> 00:08:40,412
Look, my hand
just started to shake.

196
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:43,215
It's a side effect
of these arthritis pills.

197
00:08:43,283 --> 00:08:44,583
Read the label.

198
00:08:44,651 --> 00:08:47,286
I did...
When I was typing it up,

199
00:08:47,353 --> 00:08:50,422
right before I slapped it
on a bottle of sugar pills.

200
00:08:50,490 --> 00:08:54,092
You printed
a fake label...

201
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:56,461
Just to prove
I'm a hypochondriac?

202
00:08:56,529 --> 00:08:57,863
Did it work?

203
00:08:57,931 --> 00:09:02,000
It got you fired,
you schmuck.

204
00:09:05,338 --> 00:09:07,839
An hour to convince her
to go with Dr. Kaufman,

205
00:09:07,907 --> 00:09:11,043
and only then because
he runs internal medicine.

206
00:09:11,110 --> 00:09:12,678
She wanted to leave
the hospital entirely.

207
00:09:12,745 --> 00:09:14,913
My God, a woman
getting better

208
00:09:14,981 --> 00:09:16,415
wants to leave
the hospital?

209
00:09:16,482 --> 00:09:18,250
If she's getting better,
it's not because

210
00:09:18,318 --> 00:09:20,085
you made her feel like a fool.
It couldn't be more because.

211
00:09:20,153 --> 00:09:21,587
If I hadn't,
she'd have diagnosed herself

212
00:09:21,654 --> 00:09:22,754
with six new forms
of cancer.

213
00:09:22,822 --> 00:09:24,056
<i>She'd never leave.</i>

214
00:09:24,123 --> 00:09:26,091
It's hard enough dealing
with my mom being sick.

I'm sorry she's sick.

I'm not sorry
I'm off the case.

225
00:09:47,180 --> 00:09:48,280
You're not off the case.

226
00:09:48,348 --> 00:09:50,582
You don't think
you can convince her--

227
00:09:50,650 --> 00:09:52,584
no, no.
You are staying on.

228
00:09:52,652 --> 00:09:55,420
She just can't know
about it.

229
00:09:59,938 --> 00:10:01,639
Top of the morning,
Dr. Kaufman.

230
00:10:01,707 --> 00:10:03,374
Here's the deal.

231
00:10:03,442 --> 00:10:05,109
You copy me
on all the imaging.

232
00:10:05,177 --> 00:10:07,945
- I'll have my guys run the lab tests.
- No.

233
00:10:08,013 --> 00:10:09,247
I thought you spoke
to Cuddy.

234
00:10:09,315 --> 00:10:11,449
Yeah. Then I spoke
to the elder Cuddy,

235
00:10:11,517 --> 00:10:15,019
who specifically requested
you not be involved.

236
00:10:15,087 --> 00:10:18,389
Listen, Kauffy,
you are perfectly competent,

237
00:10:18,457 --> 00:10:19,724

on good, even.

238
00:10:19,792 --> 00:10:21,392

Either way, it'd be crazy
to ignore my advice.

00:10:26,665 --> 00:10:28,232
It's not gonna stop
at advice.

243
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:29,834
You're gonna start

one that Kaufman hadn't
already come up with.

It's not cancer.
