Massive Attack's <i>? Teardrop ?</i>

5
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:04,327
What the hell happened?

6
00:02:04,413 --> 00:02:05,479
We got to get you
to a hospital.

7
00:02:05,547 --> 00:02:07,381
No, you're a doctor.
Just stitch me up.

8
00:02:07,449 --> 00:02:09,183
It's more complicated
than that. We need to--

9
00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:10,851
The cops will be
waiting for me at the hospital.

10
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:12,252
They're gonna
bust me back inside

11
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:13,453
just for being with felons.

12
00:02:13,521 --> 00:02:15,589
You stay here,
they bust me.

13
00:02:15,657 --> 00:02:17,591
I can't go back, Remy.

14
00:02:17,658 --> 00:02:18,692
<i>Neither can I.</i>
<i>God forbid you die,</i>

15
00:02:18,759 --> 00:02:20,193
I'm up for manslaughter.

16
00:02:23,164 --> 00:02:24,465
I'll find someone else.

17
00:02:24,532 --> 00:02:26,133
You leave,
you bleed out.

18
00:02:26,201 --> 00:02:28,804
You're gonna die.
Stop.

19
00:02:33,777 --> 00:02:37,981
Promise me you won't
take me to the hospital.

20
00:02:40,986 --> 00:02:43,755
I promise.

21
00:02:43,822 --> 00:02:45,523
Look at how much fun
she's having.

22
00:02:45,591 --> 00:02:47,426
That's because he has
two functioning legs,

23
00:02:47,494 --> 00:02:49,428
capable of supporting
her body weight.

24
00:02:49,496 --> 00:02:50,863
So do I.

25
00:02:50,931 --> 00:02:53,533
You told me
most of your muscle was cut out.

26
00:02:53,601 --> 00:02:56,403
I was going
for the sympathy discount.

27
00:02:56,471 --> 00:02:58,539
Been taking
some experimental medicine.

28
00:02:58,607 --> 00:02:59,941
<i>Yeah,</i>
<i>I got a lot of clients</i>

29
00:03:00,008 --> 00:03:01,509
on experimental medicine.

30
00:03:01,577 --> 00:03:03,812
You want proof?

31
00:03:07,283 --> 00:03:08,751
Okay,
this amp stack

32
00:03:08,819 --> 00:03:12,722
<i>weighs way more</i>
<i>than you do.</i>

33
00:03:17,995 --> 00:03:19,396
<i>See?</i>

34
00:03:19,464 --> 00:03:22,800
Now, even if those implants
were made of adamantium,

35
00:03:22,867 --> 00:03:23,701
<i>I'd still be able to...</i>

36
00:03:30,308 --> 00:03:31,208
<i>Sorry.</i>

37
00:03:31,275 --> 00:03:32,576
Cramp.

38
00:03:32,643 --> 00:03:34,577
I'm sure.

39
00:03:44,589 --> 00:03:47,090
I'm not gonna be needing
your services tonight after all.

40
00:03:51,663 --> 00:03:53,531
Aah!

41
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:55,200
Aah!

42
00:03:59,137 --> 00:04:00,305
Bowel's intact.

43
00:04:00,373 --> 00:04:02,941
Inferior vena cava's fine.

44
00:04:03,009 --> 00:04:04,276
Aah!

45
00:04:04,344 --> 00:04:06,946
Liver got nicked,
but it feels clotted off.

46
00:04:12,287 --> 00:04:14,621
I don't see any other signs
of internal bleeding.

47
00:04:14,689 --> 00:04:16,290
So I'm okay?

48
00:04:16,358 --> 00:04:17,926
Define okay.

49
00:04:17,993 --> 00:04:19,861
And just because
I don't see bleeding

50
00:04:19,929 --> 00:04:21,262
<i>doesn't mean</i>
<i>it's not there.</i>

51
00:04:23,498 --> 00:04:24,999
105 over palp.

52
00:04:25,067 --> 00:04:26,700
I'm gonna check your pressure
every two minutes.

53
00:04:26,768 --> 00:04:28,001
If you dip below 90,

54
00:04:28,069 --> 00:04:29,469
it means it is there
and we have a problem.

55
00:04:29,537 --> 00:04:31,505
Okay.

56
00:04:34,575 --> 00:04:36,143
Oh. Sorry.

57
00:04:41,248 --> 00:04:42,348
I should get to work.

58
00:04:42,416 --> 00:04:44,217
Wait. Ruby.

59
00:04:44,285 --> 00:04:46,519
We'll talk more
in the morning.

60
00:04:46,587 --> 00:04:47,720
<i>Good night, Eric.</i>

61
00:04:49,689 --> 00:04:51,957
You two breaking up?

62
00:04:54,693 --> 00:04:56,060
She's pregnant.

63
00:05:01,466 --> 00:05:03,100
I need a drink.

64
00:05:06,838 --> 00:05:09,073
There was a raid.

65
00:05:09,141 --> 00:05:12,243
Andre needed to do something
to slow the cops down.

66
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:14,711
He stabbed you
as a distraction?

67
00:05:14,779 --> 00:05:16,180
Didn't work.

68
00:05:16,247 --> 00:05:17,981
<i>Cops called an ambulance,</i>

69
00:05:18,049 --> 00:05:19,215
left me lying there.

70
00:05:21,419 --> 00:05:23,486
Oh, come on.

71
00:05:23,554 --> 00:05:24,788
Give me crap.

72
00:05:24,856 --> 00:05:26,756
<i>I know what</i>
<i>I  told you about him,</i>

73
00:05:26,824 --> 00:05:30,326
but it's not his fault
I started using again.

74
00:05:30,394 --> 00:05:31,761
It's mine.

75
00:05:33,464 --> 00:05:35,231
What?

76
00:05:35,299 --> 00:05:37,334
According to this,
you're dead.

77
00:05:37,401 --> 00:05:38,768
You have no blood pressure.

78
00:05:38,836 --> 00:05:40,970
Barely have a pulse.

79
00:05:41,038 --> 00:05:42,505
Am I dying?

80
00:05:42,572 --> 00:05:43,806
You're talking and alert,

81
00:05:43,874 --> 00:05:46,408
so your brain
is getting blood.

82
00:05:51,081 --> 00:05:53,583
Pulse in your right arm
is fine.

83
00:05:53,650 --> 00:05:55,017
So is your B.P.

84
00:06:05,629 --> 00:06:07,130
Hello.

85
00:06:07,197 --> 00:06:08,998
<i>Are you busy?</i>

86
00:06:09,066 --> 00:06:10,767
Yeah, I'm, uh,

87
00:06:10,834 --> 00:06:12,869
I'm about to go out.

88
00:06:12,936 --> 00:06:15,038
Great. Uh, can you
do me a huge favor?

89
00:06:15,105 --> 00:06:16,472
I need you
to go to the hospital

90
00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:17,707
and check out a portable
ultrasound machine for me.

91
00:06:17,775 --> 00:06:19,275
Who's the father?

92
00:06:19,343 --> 00:06:21,210
<i>I have a leak in my bathroom,</i>

93
00:06:21,278 --> 00:06:22,678
and my guy won't come

94
00:06:22,746 --> 00:06:24,280
take a look at it
till tomorrow morning,

95
00:06:24,348 --> 00:06:26,549
and an emergency plumber's
200 bucks an hour.

96
00:06:35,459 --> 00:06:36,892
<i>Dr. House.</i>

97
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:39,561
Dr. Riggin.

98
00:06:39,629 --> 00:06:41,863
Figures you'd be wrapping up
the trial by now.

99
00:06:41,931 --> 00:06:43,665
I just wanted to give you
a hearty mazel tov.

100
00:06:43,733 --> 00:06:45,501
And don't forget
the Nobel Prize

101
00:06:45,568 --> 00:06:47,970
for developing an incredibly
expensive rat poison.

102
00:06:48,037 --> 00:06:50,438
What do you mean?
What happened?

103
00:06:50,506 --> 00:06:51,773
Tumors.

104
00:06:51,841 --> 00:06:54,009
Just look at these things.

105
00:07:03,219 --> 00:07:06,421
Any indication
the rats were getting sick?

106
00:07:06,488 --> 00:07:07,555
Just some cramping.

107
00:07:07,623 --> 00:07:08,822
Their legs would stiffen up.

108
00:07:08,890 --> 00:07:10,357
They were having trouble
moving around.

109
00:07:10,425 --> 00:07:11,725
<i>We just thought their bodies</i>

110
00:07:11,793 --> 00:07:13,026
<i>were adjusting to the increase</i>
<i>in muscle mass,</i>

111
00:07:13,094 --> 00:07:17,463
but within a day or so
they just started dying.

112
00:07:17,531 --> 00:07:18,865
Oh, well.

113
00:07:18,932 --> 00:07:21,033
<i>Get a new compound</i>
<i>to play with next week.</i>

114
00:07:24,875 --> 00:07:26,242
One portable ultrasound.

115
00:07:26,309 --> 00:07:27,209
Extra pepperoni.

116
00:07:27,277 --> 00:07:28,710
Thank you so much.

117
00:07:28,778 --> 00:07:30,745
I might be late tomorrow.

118
00:07:30,813 --> 00:07:32,514
Your socks are dry.

119
00:07:32,582 --> 00:07:34,015
And, unfortunately,
so is your shirt,

120
00:07:34,083 --> 00:07:35,884
which means you either
just changed to greet me,

121
00:07:35,952 --> 00:07:38,753
or you need this
for something medical.

122
00:07:38,821 --> 00:07:41,122
I am a doctor.

123
00:07:52,234 --> 00:07:54,436
She's my friend.

124
00:07:54,504 --> 00:07:57,474
I was in prison.

125
00:08:29,038 --> 00:08:30,672
You killed your own brother?

126
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:32,207
Yes.

127
00:08:32,275 --> 00:08:34,108
It was awful and devastating,
but it wasn't murder.

128
00:08:34,176 --> 00:08:35,610
<i>He was sick</i>
<i>and he wanted to die,</i>

129
00:08:35,678 --> 00:08:36,978
<i>and I promised I would help.</i>

130
00:08:37,046 --> 00:08:39,714
Now please stop pacing
and help me find this thing.

131
00:08:39,782 --> 00:08:42,117
Have you talked
to anybody about it?

132
00:08:42,185 --> 00:08:44,019
I mean, are you okay?

133
00:08:44,087 --> 00:08:45,655
No, I may have
an aortic arch aneurysm.

134
00:08:45,722 --> 00:08:46,922
Oh, wait, that's her.

135
00:08:46,990 --> 00:08:49,492
<i>Either help me or leave.</i>

136
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:51,094
Having trouble
getting a clear look.

137
00:08:51,162 --> 00:08:52,863
Try a long axis view
from the suprasternal notch.

138
00:08:55,167 --> 00:08:57,001
Wait! Put on some gloves.
She's got Hep-C.

139
00:08:57,069 --> 00:08:59,370
Wonderful.

140
00:08:59,438 --> 00:09:01,339
Take it
you two were cell mates.

141
00:09:01,407 --> 00:09:02,974
Just friends.

142
00:09:03,042 --> 00:09:05,143
She saved me.

143
00:09:06,779 --> 00:09:08,146
<i>There's a culture in prison.</i>

144
00:09:08,213 --> 00:09:09,214
<i>If you don't have someone</i>
<i>to show you</i>

145
00:09:09,281 --> 00:09:10,715
how to get
the stuff you need

146
00:09:10,783 --> 00:09:12,416
and stay away
from the stuff you don't,

147
00:09:12,484 --> 00:09:14,318
you're screwed.
<i>Her fingers are turning blue.</i>

148
00:09:14,385 --> 00:09:15,752
Can you move those?

149
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:17,054
My arm's
starting to go numb.

150
00:09:17,121 --> 00:09:18,121
Arch of aorta's clear.

151
00:09:18,189 --> 00:09:20,290
This can't be an aneurysm.

152
00:09:20,358 --> 00:09:21,458
Maybe the wound threw a clot.

153
00:09:21,525 --> 00:09:22,659
Check axillary arteries.

154
00:09:26,997 --> 00:09:29,298
<i>Stop.</i>
<i>Right there.</i>

155
00:09:29,366 --> 00:09:31,100
5 centimeter gooey mass.

156
00:09:31,168 --> 00:09:32,635
Not a clot.
Maybe a lipoma?

157
00:09:32,703 --> 00:09:33,970
What the hell is that?

158
00:09:34,037 --> 00:09:35,237
Fat-filled sack.

159
00:09:35,305 --> 00:09:37,040
Probably aggravated
by the stab wound.

160
00:09:37,107 --> 00:09:39,208
You got any syringes in here?
Give me that.

161
00:09:39,276 --> 00:09:40,977
I was stabbed in my gut,
not in my arm.

162
00:09:41,044 --> 00:09:42,078
You lost a lot of blood,

163
00:09:42,145 --> 00:09:43,412
gave the lipoma room
to swell.

164
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:44,681
It's compressing
the arteries in your arm,

165
00:09:44,748 --> 00:09:46,549
<i>blocking your blood flow.</i>

166
00:09:46,617 --> 00:09:48,551
Maybe we can suck
some of it out.

167
00:09:48,619 --> 00:09:52,022
You'll be fine.
Little pinch.

168
00:09:56,460 --> 00:10:00,263
That's not lipoma.

169
00:10:03,401 --> 00:10:09,706
? ?

170
00:10:09,774 --> 00:10:10,907
I don't know why she's
even considering

171
00:10:10,975 --> 00:10:12,375
having my kid.

172
00:10:12,443 --> 00:10:13,876
She barely knows me.

173
00:10:13,944 --> 00:10:15,345
All she knows is
I'm a short, balding guy.

174
00:10:15,413 --> 00:10:17,948
It doesn't even make
evolutionary sense.

175
00:10:18,016 --> 00:10:21,218
You want her to keep it?
No.

176
00:10:21,285 --> 00:10:22,386
<i>'Cause you'd make a crappy dad.</i>

177
00:10:22,453 --> 00:10:24,354
I said, "no."

178
00:10:24,422 --> 00:10:25,489
You're too selfish.

179
00:10:25,556 --> 00:10:26,756
That's why you cheated
on your wife,

180
00:10:26,824 --> 00:10:28,258
why your marriage fell apart--
dude, I said--

181
00:10:28,326 --> 00:10:29,659
I know you.

182
00:10:29,727 --> 00:10:30,827
The only reason you're sitting
in a strip club,

183
00:10:30,895 --> 00:10:32,362
ignoring the strip club,

184
00:10:32,430 --> 00:10:34,130
is because you actually
are considering it.

185
00:10:42,172 --> 00:10:47,444
Although without crappy dads
in the world...

186
00:10:58,658 --> 00:10:59,892
Try moving your fingers again.

187
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:01,494
Good.

188
00:11:01,561 --> 00:11:04,330
Means it's almost drained.

189
00:11:04,398 --> 00:11:06,266
Not good enough.

190
00:11:06,333 --> 00:11:07,533
<i>We don't know</i>
<i>if it's gonna come back.</i>

191
00:11:07,601 --> 00:11:08,734
We don't even know
what it is--

192
00:11:08,802 --> 00:11:10,370
drugs, viruses,
toxins from that crack house

193
00:11:10,437 --> 00:11:12,038
and God knows where else
she's been.

194
00:11:12,106 --> 00:11:13,940
If this were caused
by the drugs,

195
00:11:14,008 --> 00:11:15,909
she'd have kidney failure,
cardiac involvement.

196
00:11:15,976 --> 00:11:17,510
What about her Hep-C?

197
00:11:17,578 --> 00:11:20,913
Could have fried her liver.
Loses its synthetic function.

198
00:11:20,981 --> 00:11:22,081
Then her entire body
would be swelling,

199
00:11:22,149 --> 00:11:23,316
not just her arm.

200
00:11:23,384 --> 00:11:24,885
That leaves us with toxins.

201
00:11:24,952 --> 00:11:26,954
Where exactly were you
when you were attacked?

202
00:11:27,021 --> 00:11:28,021
You're not doing
a home search

203
00:11:28,089 --> 00:11:29,523
in a crack den;
That's insane.

204
00:11:29,590 --> 00:11:30,958
Apparently, we don't
have much of a choice.

205
00:11:31,025 --> 00:11:32,927
It's a crime scene,
and it's not toxins

206
00:11:32,994 --> 00:11:35,596
<i>or viruses or anything</i>
<i>else you mentioned,</i>

207
00:11:35,664 --> 00:11:36,998
because it's not a coincidence.

208
00:11:37,066 --> 00:11:38,299
Her symptoms have
to be related to the stabbing.

209
00:11:43,072 --> 00:11:44,873
What if her body used up
all the clotting factors

210
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:45,974
dealing with the stab wound?

211
00:11:46,042 --> 00:11:48,276
Explains the bloody mass.

212
00:11:48,344 --> 00:11:50,578
<i>But if you're right, she could</i>
<i>start bleeding anywhere,</i>

213
00:11:50,646 --> 00:11:51,980
<i>like in her brain</i>
<i>or in her heart.</i>

214
00:11:52,047 --> 00:11:54,515
One of those things could start
growing in my brain?

215
00:11:54,583 --> 00:11:56,149
It's time to get you
to the hospital.

216
00:11:56,217 --> 00:11:57,984
Oh, no.

217
00:11:58,052 --> 00:12:00,153
Remy, you promised.

218
00:12:03,658 --> 00:12:05,559
All we'll do at the hospital
is stick her in a patient bed

219
00:12:05,627 --> 00:12:06,961
and give her IV
clotting factors.

220
00:12:07,029 --> 00:12:08,463
We can do that right here.

221
00:12:08,530 --> 00:12:09,664
We could also embalm her
right here.

222
00:12:09,731 --> 00:12:11,599
I'll call the drugs in.
You go pick them up.

223
00:12:11,667 --> 00:12:13,601
If I'm right,
she'll be fine.

224
00:12:13,669 --> 00:12:16,572
<i>Look, I know you</i>
<i>don't know her</i>

225
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:18,607
and you don't care about her,
but I do.

226
00:12:20,377 --> 00:12:23,781
Please.

227
00:12:23,848 --> 00:12:31,755
? ?

228
00:14:08,823 --> 00:14:10,057
Lie down,
elevate your shoulder.

229
00:14:19,333 --> 00:14:21,400
You said Andre wasn't
responsible for the drugs.

230
00:14:21,468 --> 00:14:22,735
What is?

231
00:14:22,803 --> 00:14:24,236
Oh, I don't know.

232
00:14:24,304 --> 00:14:25,938
Yes, you do.

233
00:14:26,005 --> 00:14:27,372
What happened to you?

234
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:30,141
If you don't deal
with the real problem--

235
00:14:30,209 --> 00:14:32,977
I came here because
you're a doctor...

236
00:14:33,045 --> 00:14:37,481
Not a shrink.

237
00:16:07,073 --> 00:16:08,807
Ugh!

238
00:16:25,392 --> 00:16:27,092
Ah!

239
00:17:01,426 --> 00:17:02,593
Your lap is vibrating.

240
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:04,061
Oh, sorry.

241
00:17:04,129 --> 00:17:05,429
Uh, it's my boss.

242
00:17:05,497 --> 00:17:07,230
Probably drunk.

243
00:17:07,298 --> 00:17:08,965
Wants a ride home.
He can take a cab.

244
00:17:11,769 --> 00:17:13,436
Do you have any kids?

245
00:17:13,504 --> 00:17:14,437
Why?
You like moms?

246
00:17:14,505 --> 00:17:15,439
<i>I could be your mommy.</i>

247
00:17:15,506 --> 00:17:17,207
Spank your little ass.

248
00:17:17,275 --> 00:17:21,545
Mmm, uh, no.
I--

249
00:17:21,613 --> 00:17:24,214
what would you do
if you got pregnant?

250
00:17:24,281 --> 00:17:26,683
Not by me...at all,

251
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:28,651
<i>but by some hypothetical guy</i>

252
00:17:28,719 --> 00:17:31,720
who didn't want to keep
the hypothetical kid.

253
00:17:31,788 --> 00:17:32,654
What would be
the least awful way

254
00:17:32,722 --> 00:17:33,755
<i>for him to tell you that?</i>

255
00:17:33,823 --> 00:17:35,123
Don't talk.

256
00:17:35,191 --> 00:17:37,826
Just let mama dance for you.

257
00:17:42,099 --> 00:17:43,566
Should I send flowers?

258
00:17:43,634 --> 00:17:45,502
<i>Maybe write</i>
<i>the clinic appointment</i>

259
00:17:45,570 --> 00:17:47,304
on the little card?

260
00:17:47,372 --> 00:17:49,106
Surprise!

261
00:17:49,174 --> 00:17:51,809
I hate myself.

262
00:17:51,877 --> 00:17:53,978
There's just no good way to--

263
00:17:56,282 --> 00:17:57,782
how long have you
had this mole?

264
00:17:57,850 --> 00:17:58,817
<i>It's asymmetrical.</i>

265
00:17:58,885 --> 00:18:00,285
No touching.

266
00:18:00,353 --> 00:18:06,092
Sorry.

267
00:18:06,159 --> 00:18:07,493
Have you been to see
a dermatologist?

268
00:18:08,929 --> 00:18:10,028
<i>Bobby!</i>

269
00:18:10,096 --> 00:18:12,197
<i>Oh, uh...</i>

270
00:18:12,265 --> 00:18:14,266
I wasn't touching her.
I was just--

271
00:18:14,334 --> 00:18:16,568
oh, God.

272
00:18:16,636 --> 00:18:18,304
Oh!

273
00:18:30,818 --> 00:18:33,520
No.

274
00:18:33,588 --> 00:18:36,090
No, please don't.

275
00:18:36,158 --> 00:18:38,025
Please, please...
Put the gun down.

276
00:18:45,868 --> 00:18:47,636
Put it down
on the ground

277
00:18:47,704 --> 00:18:49,238
<i>and get away!</i>

278
00:18:53,376 --> 00:18:55,044
Dee?
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

279
00:18:55,112 --> 00:18:58,748
I'm sorry.

280
00:19:00,517 --> 00:19:01,783
I'm sorry.

281
00:19:01,851 --> 00:19:05,053
Dee, what is it?

282
00:19:05,121 --> 00:19:08,189
I'm so sorry.

283
00:19:08,257 --> 00:19:10,892
I'm sorry!

284
00:19:36,088 --> 00:19:38,490
Mmm.

285
00:19:44,097 --> 00:19:45,697
Why aren't you in your bed?

286
00:19:45,765 --> 00:19:48,000
<i>Jibber me jabbers.</i>

287
00:19:48,068 --> 00:19:50,168
I'll give ye splinters
in yer arse,

288
00:19:50,236 --> 00:19:51,870
ye mangy bilge rat.

289
00:19:51,938 --> 00:19:54,873
What are you watching?

290
00:19:54,941 --> 00:19:57,777
TV, you bloody scallywag.

291
00:19:59,447 --> 00:20:00,747
<i>Mom!</i>

292
00:20:04,119 --> 00:20:06,454
Someone better be dying.

293
00:20:12,795 --> 00:20:14,096
She hallucinated.
I need you to go back out.

294
00:20:14,163 --> 00:20:15,830
I just called in more
clotting factor.

295
00:20:15,898 --> 00:20:17,699
So she's bleeding
in her brain now.

296
00:20:17,767 --> 00:20:18,867
We double up the dose,
she'll be fine.

297
00:20:18,935 --> 00:20:20,035
No.

298
00:20:20,102 --> 00:20:21,603
We bring her to the hospital,

299
00:20:21,670 --> 00:20:23,004
we do a CT scan
to locate the bleed,

300
00:20:23,072 --> 00:20:24,305
drill a burr hole
in her skull,

301
00:20:24,373 --> 00:20:26,174
and <i>maybe</i> she'll be fine.

302
00:20:26,242 --> 00:20:27,808
We can drill
a burr hole here.

303
00:20:27,876 --> 00:20:31,478
You're not just risking
our careers here.

304
00:20:31,546 --> 00:20:33,147
You could go back to prison.

305
00:20:33,214 --> 00:20:35,115
I made a promise.

306
00:20:35,183 --> 00:20:36,551
You made a promise?

307
00:20:36,619 --> 00:20:40,622
I will not take her
to the hospital.

308
00:20:40,690 --> 00:20:41,556
Great.
Then I will.

309
00:20:41,624 --> 00:20:43,091
No.

310
00:20:43,159 --> 00:20:44,726
I'm gonna move you,

311
00:20:44,794 --> 00:20:46,629
and then I'm gonna
pick your friend up,

312
00:20:46,696 --> 00:20:48,431
carry her down to my car,
take her to the hospital,

313
00:20:48,499 --> 00:20:49,999
and try to save her life.

314
00:20:50,067 --> 00:20:52,035
She's staying here.

315
00:20:52,103 --> 00:20:53,737
Move.

316
00:20:55,908 --> 00:20:57,475
Move!

317
00:21:14,861 --> 00:21:16,696
She's going to the hospital.

318
00:21:29,552 --> 00:21:30,419
Sweetie...

319
00:21:30,476 --> 00:21:32,010
Go wait for mommy
by the couch, okay?

320
00:21:32,077 --> 00:21:34,312
Go on.

321
00:21:37,216 --> 00:21:39,451
I tried calling everyone else.

322
00:21:39,518 --> 00:21:42,488
You were the last one
on the list.

323
00:21:42,556 --> 00:21:44,256
<i>Any reason why 911 wasn't</i>
<i>on the list?</i>

324
00:21:44,324 --> 00:21:45,624
It's not an emergency.

325
00:21:45,692 --> 00:21:47,293
Right.

326
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:50,196
Are you suicidal?

327
00:21:50,264 --> 00:21:51,965
I'm not attempting
bypass surgery.

328
00:21:52,033 --> 00:21:53,934
<i>The tumors are small</i>

329
00:21:54,001 --> 00:21:55,970
and they're close
to the surface.

330
00:21:56,037 --> 00:21:58,072
I thought it'd be like...

331
00:21:58,140 --> 00:21:59,507
removing a wart.

332
00:21:59,575 --> 00:22:01,510
You couldn't wait
till morning,

333
00:22:01,578 --> 00:22:03,512
bring your CT
to an actual surgeon?

334
00:22:03,580 --> 00:22:04,847
<i>Surgeons are idiots.</i>

335
00:22:04,915 --> 00:22:07,784
They'd just hack away
at the muscle

336
00:22:07,852 --> 00:22:09,953
until they get worn out.

337
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:11,720
Or you're just ashamed
you've been injecting a drug

338
00:22:11,788 --> 00:22:14,123
that hasn't even
gone through safety trials.

339
00:22:14,190 --> 00:22:15,257
<i>It's never even been</i>
<i>in the human body.</i>

340
00:22:15,325 --> 00:22:16,491
I got one of the tumors.

341
00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:18,026
The second one is close.

342
00:22:18,093 --> 00:22:20,862
You can use the CT
to help you find the third.

343
00:22:20,930 --> 00:22:22,297
I'm taking you
to the hospital.

344
00:22:22,365 --> 00:22:24,332
Just--just excise the tumor.

345
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:27,602
Absolutely not!

346
00:22:40,383 --> 00:22:42,083
Elevate her head more.

347
00:22:42,151 --> 00:22:43,818
Don't bother.

348
00:22:43,885 --> 00:22:45,719
Cops are gonna be waiting
at the front door.

349
00:22:47,288 --> 00:22:48,956
I'll go in first.

350
00:22:49,024 --> 00:22:50,390
I'll find a patient
on life support

351
00:22:50,458 --> 00:22:52,059
<i>who's waiting to die.</i>

352
00:22:52,127 --> 00:22:53,294
<i>We'll use their name</i>
<i>on all your tests.</i>

353
00:22:53,362 --> 00:22:55,829
No one will ever know
you're there.

354
00:22:55,897 --> 00:22:58,265
Thanks.

355
00:23:06,074 --> 00:23:07,642
What happened to your leg?

356
00:23:10,045 --> 00:23:12,146
I was trying
to make it better.

357
00:23:12,214 --> 00:23:13,181
<i>He was being reckless.</i>

358
00:23:13,248 --> 00:23:14,615
Sit back, honey.

359
00:23:17,052 --> 00:23:19,287
This isn't about
making your leg better.

360
00:23:19,355 --> 00:23:20,221
<i>It's about making</i>
<i>your life better.</i>

361
00:23:20,289 --> 00:23:21,890
Here we go.

362
00:23:21,958 --> 00:23:23,892
Wish I had called 911.

363
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:25,026
Why else would you
risk your life

364
00:23:25,094 --> 00:23:26,562
doing something so stupid?

365
00:23:26,630 --> 00:23:29,999
Well, you know, I've had a lot
of setbacks lately.

366
00:23:30,067 --> 00:23:32,068
Don't blame our breakup
for this.

367
00:23:32,136 --> 00:23:33,969
<i>You're not unhappy</i>
<i>because of me.</i>

368
00:23:34,037 --> 00:23:35,538
<i>You're just unhappy.</i>

369
00:23:37,407 --> 00:23:40,576
Unhappy people
do reckless things.

370
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:45,148
Darrien!

371
00:23:45,215 --> 00:23:46,449
Stop screaming.
My head hurts.

372
00:23:46,517 --> 00:23:47,617
I need you to stay awake.
Talk to me.

373
00:23:47,685 --> 00:23:49,552
About what?

374
00:23:49,620 --> 00:23:51,954
When you were screaming
in my room,

375
00:23:52,022 --> 00:23:53,155
what did you think
you saw?

376
00:23:53,223 --> 00:23:54,824
You said,
"put it down on the ground

377
00:23:54,891 --> 00:23:58,327
and get away."

378
00:23:58,395 --> 00:24:00,162
Sounds like a cop.

379
00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:02,298
Old habits, I guess.

380
00:24:02,365 --> 00:24:04,066
You were a cop?

381
00:24:04,134 --> 00:24:06,035
Back when I was
a decent person.

382
00:24:06,103 --> 00:24:08,605
How do I not know this?

383
00:24:08,673 --> 00:24:10,207
<i>You knew everything--</i>

384
00:24:10,274 --> 00:24:13,577
Not a good resume when you're
trying to survive in prison.

385
00:24:13,645 --> 00:24:16,247
So who were you
talking to in my bedroom?

386
00:24:16,315 --> 00:24:19,517
<i>Why did you keep</i>
<i>apologizing?</i>

387
00:24:19,585 --> 00:24:22,087
'Cause I'm sorry.

388
00:24:22,155 --> 00:24:24,990
<i>For what?</i>

389
00:24:25,058 --> 00:24:27,092
I killed a kid.

390
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:30,229
<i>He was 19.</i>

391
00:24:30,297 --> 00:24:35,034
I went in first.

392
00:24:35,102 --> 00:24:36,569
Saw him going for his gun.

393
00:24:39,873 --> 00:24:44,575
I tried to talk him down,
but...

394
00:24:48,613 --> 00:24:52,883
They told me I was a hero.

395
00:24:52,951 --> 00:24:55,886
So that's when you started
using drugs?

396
00:24:58,556 --> 00:25:00,824
I'm sorry.

397
00:25:03,894 --> 00:25:06,396
Darrien?

398
00:25:06,464 --> 00:25:08,499
Darrien!

399
00:25:08,566 --> 00:25:10,968
She lost consciousness.

400
00:25:19,744 --> 00:25:22,946
There are no cars coming.
Just go.

401
00:25:23,014 --> 00:25:25,315
The light is red,
ye bloody scallywag.

402
00:25:25,383 --> 00:25:27,384
Stop with the pirate talk.

403
00:25:27,452 --> 00:25:30,120
<i>If you don't want brownbeard</i>

404
00:25:30,188 --> 00:25:32,689
to end up with
two wooden legs,

405
00:25:32,757 --> 00:25:34,358
better get yer ma
to move this ship,

406
00:25:34,426 --> 00:25:36,093
you mangy bilge rat.

407
00:25:37,662 --> 00:25:39,697
Of course...

408
00:25:39,764 --> 00:25:40,898
You showed her
that filthy cartoon.

409
00:25:40,965 --> 00:25:42,799
<i>What kind of idiot</i>

410
00:25:42,867 --> 00:25:45,602
lets a three-year-old
watch that?

411
00:25:45,670 --> 00:25:47,938
If you want to lecture me
on my poor judgment,

412
00:25:48,006 --> 00:25:53,109
there would seem
to be more relevant examples.

413
00:25:56,213 --> 00:25:57,846
There you are.

414
00:25:57,914 --> 00:25:59,215
You were in the VIP room
so long,

415
00:25:59,282 --> 00:26:01,049
I thought you were gonna
pay off that girl's mortgage.

416
00:26:01,117 --> 00:26:03,118
I got tossed out
by Bobby the bouncer.

417
00:26:03,185 --> 00:26:05,953
You touched her?

418
00:26:06,021 --> 00:26:08,522
I was looking at her mole.

419
00:26:08,590 --> 00:26:09,523
Genius.

420
00:26:09,591 --> 00:26:10,958
Let's go home.

421
00:26:11,026 --> 00:26:14,095
I want to wait
for the girl,

422
00:26:14,162 --> 00:26:15,797
make sure that mole's okay.

423
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:18,633
<i>Bobby the bouncer</i>
<i>sees you</i>

424
00:26:18,701 --> 00:26:19,934
standing out here
like a stalker,

425
00:26:20,002 --> 00:26:21,603
he's gonna break open
your skull.

426
00:26:21,670 --> 00:26:24,006
It was asymmetrical.
It could be cancerous.

427
00:26:26,109 --> 00:26:27,542
You want to get your skull
cracked open.

428
00:26:27,610 --> 00:26:29,945
You're trying
to punish yourself.

429
00:26:30,013 --> 00:26:31,113
I want to fulfill
my oath as a doctor.

430
00:26:31,181 --> 00:26:32,715
<i>You think you're a screw-up</i>

431
00:26:32,782 --> 00:26:33,916
because you got
a girl pregnant

432
00:26:33,983 --> 00:26:34,983
and you deserve to suffer.

433
00:26:35,051 --> 00:26:36,151
You don't.

434
00:26:36,218 --> 00:26:37,685
<i>You just need some sleep</i>

435
00:26:37,753 --> 00:26:38,786
and you'll handle this mess.

436
00:26:38,854 --> 00:26:40,221
Let's get in the car.

437
00:26:40,289 --> 00:26:43,424
She's probably
off work soon.

438
00:26:43,492 --> 00:26:46,194
Give me the keys.
I'll drive.

439
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:52,867
I'll get a cab.

440
00:26:52,934 --> 00:26:57,839
<i>Good luck with everything.</i>

441
00:26:57,906 --> 00:27:00,541
<i>You were defending your friend</i>
<i>beyond all rationality,</i>

442
00:27:00,609 --> 00:27:02,843
granting her the right
to die in your bedroom.

443
00:27:02,911 --> 00:27:04,812
Was it really all
because of a promise?

444
00:27:04,879 --> 00:27:06,946
That word means something
to some people.

445
00:27:07,014 --> 00:27:08,581
Not that much.

446
00:27:08,648 --> 00:27:09,882
I don't see the bleed.

447
00:27:09,950 --> 00:27:11,717
I'm moving down
to the brain stem.

448
00:27:15,956 --> 00:27:17,957
You promised your brother
you'd euthanize him

449
00:27:18,025 --> 00:27:19,659
<i>and you think you won't</i>
<i>feel bad about it</i>

450
00:27:19,726 --> 00:27:21,627
<i>as long as you can blame it</i>
<i>on the promise.</i>

451
00:27:21,695 --> 00:27:23,029
That's why you have
this twisted obligation

452
00:27:23,096 --> 00:27:25,932
to keep all promises...

453
00:27:25,999 --> 00:27:27,466
Or your carefully constructed
defense mechanism

454
00:27:27,534 --> 00:27:28,667
could crumble down.

455
00:27:28,735 --> 00:27:32,771
I saved my brother from
a lot of pain.

456
00:27:37,644 --> 00:27:39,244
Reconstructed image is clear.

457
00:27:39,312 --> 00:27:42,647
There's no bleed
in Darrien's brain.

458
00:27:42,715 --> 00:27:44,783
Image just blurred.
Did she wake up?

459
00:27:44,851 --> 00:27:47,052
<i>She's shivering.</i>

460
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:49,688
She must have a fever.

461
00:27:49,756 --> 00:27:51,090
Infection?

462
00:27:51,158 --> 00:27:52,191
It couldn't be from
the stabbing.

463
00:27:52,259 --> 00:27:53,392
It has to be
from the stabbing.

464
00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:54,794
No, it couldn't
be acting that quickly.

465
00:27:54,861 --> 00:27:57,930
Well, then what's wrong
with her?

466
00:28:09,810 --> 00:28:11,477
Your heart rate's over 120.

467
00:28:11,544 --> 00:28:12,678
You're clammy.

468
00:28:12,745 --> 00:28:14,379
I think you're going
into shock.

469
00:28:14,447 --> 00:28:16,348
Are you lightheaded?

470
00:28:16,416 --> 00:28:18,750
I'm fine.

471
00:28:18,818 --> 00:28:20,719
Did you see
the new Brownbeard episode?

472
00:28:20,787 --> 00:28:22,288
It was so funny.

473
00:28:22,355 --> 00:28:25,324
<i>No, it was so lame.</i>

474
00:28:25,392 --> 00:28:26,558
Got a boat full
of guy pirates

475
00:28:26,626 --> 00:28:28,594
and they make the girl pirate
walk the plank.

476
00:28:28,662 --> 00:28:29,929
She floated.

477
00:28:29,996 --> 00:28:31,630
That's 'cause she had
big boobies.

478
00:28:31,698 --> 00:28:32,998
That's why he should have
kept her.

479
00:28:33,066 --> 00:28:33,899
We've got to get you
into surgery.

480
00:28:33,967 --> 00:28:35,067
Where is that nurse?

481
00:28:35,135 --> 00:28:38,003
Rachel, let's go find
the nurse.

482
00:28:53,785 --> 00:28:55,185
2:00 a.m.

483
00:28:55,253 --> 00:28:56,854
Nice of you to call me back.

484
00:28:56,922 --> 00:28:58,689
Chase and I are in
the hospital with a patient.

485
00:28:58,757 --> 00:29:00,091
You've completely
run out of ideas

486
00:29:00,158 --> 00:29:01,960
and you're calling me
to bail you out.

487
00:29:02,028 --> 00:29:03,294
<i>I'm touched.</i>

488
00:29:03,362 --> 00:29:05,096
Hit me.

489
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:15,207
<i>Command, please.</i>

490
00:29:15,275 --> 00:29:17,109
Call Ruby.

491
00:29:17,177 --> 00:29:19,845
<i>Would you like to call Ruby</i>
<i>on the cell phone?</i>

492
00:29:23,783 --> 00:29:25,551
No.

493
00:29:29,088 --> 00:29:31,756
She on any medication...
Besides crack?

494
00:29:31,824 --> 00:29:33,658
She was taking Interferon
in prison,

495
00:29:33,726 --> 00:29:35,994
so I'm guessing she's had Hep-C
for at least ten years.

496
00:29:36,062 --> 00:29:37,562
Can I guess stuff too?

497
00:29:37,630 --> 00:29:40,199
'Cause that's gonna make
the diagnosis really easy.

498
00:29:40,267 --> 00:29:41,834
Prison infirmary isn't known
for stellar record keeping.

499
00:29:41,902 --> 00:29:43,670
And we can't exactly ask
the patient.

500
00:29:43,738 --> 00:29:45,205
<i>Yeah, that would have</i>
<i>been pre-coma.</i>

501
00:29:45,273 --> 00:29:46,373
But how could you have known

502
00:29:46,441 --> 00:29:47,908
that it would affect her
that way?

503
00:29:47,976 --> 00:29:49,577
We didn't think we had
anything mysterious until--

504
00:29:49,645 --> 00:29:50,979
<i>How about renal cancer</i>

505
00:29:51,046 --> 00:29:52,881
throwing clots?

506
00:29:52,948 --> 00:29:54,415
Urinalysis was negative.
<i>That's too bad.</i>

507
00:29:54,483 --> 00:29:56,317
'Cause that was
my one big idea.

508
00:29:56,385 --> 00:29:57,252
Really?

509
00:30:02,758 --> 00:30:05,860
<i>House?</i>

510
00:30:05,928 --> 00:30:07,128
<i>House, you there?</i>

511
00:30:09,365 --> 00:30:11,666
Tell me more about
the patient.

512
00:30:11,734 --> 00:30:13,268
What was she doing
before prison?

513
00:30:13,335 --> 00:30:14,569
<i>She was a cop.</i>

514
00:30:14,637 --> 00:30:16,238
Shot a kid in self defense,

515
00:30:16,305 --> 00:30:17,740
<i>never got over the guilt,</i>
<i>started taking drugs,</i>

516
00:30:17,807 --> 00:30:18,841
and got busted.

517
00:30:18,909 --> 00:30:20,610
Way to bury the lead.

518
00:30:20,677 --> 00:30:21,911
<i>How long ago</i>
<i>was the shooting?</i>

519
00:30:21,979 --> 00:30:23,580
I'm not sure.
Why?

520
00:30:23,648 --> 00:30:26,484
<i>Again, you assumed she's had</i>
<i>Hep-C for ten years.</i>

521
00:30:26,551 --> 00:30:27,852
Find out when she
shot the kid,

522
00:30:27,919 --> 00:30:29,487
you'll find out when
she started taking drugs,

523
00:30:29,555 --> 00:30:31,823
and when she actually
contracted the Hep-C.

524
00:30:31,891 --> 00:30:33,158
And you think
this is relevant?

525
00:30:33,226 --> 00:30:34,192
<i>It's more relevant</i>
<i>than what you got now,</i>

526
00:30:34,260 --> 00:30:35,494
which is squat.

527
00:30:35,562 --> 00:30:38,564
Three chicks just came
into my bedroom.

528
00:30:38,631 --> 00:30:41,233
I got to go.

529
00:30:48,007 --> 00:30:49,007
<i>Command, please.</i>

530
00:30:49,074 --> 00:30:50,675
Call Rachel.

531
00:30:50,743 --> 00:30:53,311
<i>Would you like to call Rachel</i>
<i>on the cell phone?</i>

532
00:30:55,547 --> 00:30:57,448
No.

533
00:31:01,954 --> 00:31:03,789
What the hell?

534
00:31:03,856 --> 00:31:06,458
I really am a doctor.
I just wanted--

535
00:31:06,526 --> 00:31:07,560
Cop another feel?
Get away from me.

536
00:31:07,628 --> 00:31:08,561
<i>No, that mole.</i>

537
00:31:08,629 --> 00:31:10,196
I just wanted--

538
00:31:10,264 --> 00:31:12,632
<i>please, don't call Bobby.</i>

539
00:31:14,101 --> 00:31:15,702
<i>Just...</i>

540
00:31:15,770 --> 00:31:17,471
Calm down.
<i>Shut up!</i>

541
00:31:17,538 --> 00:31:19,739
Sick perv!
Get down on your knees!

542
00:31:19,807 --> 00:31:20,907
You think I'm kidding?

543
00:31:20,975 --> 00:31:23,342
Turn around and get down
on your knees!

544
00:31:25,846 --> 00:31:27,313
Please don't.

545
00:31:27,381 --> 00:31:29,382
I said shut up!
Please, please please...

546
00:31:29,449 --> 00:31:30,846
You think you're the first guy
who thought he was special?

547
00:31:30,871 --> 00:31:31,651
Please, please, please...

548
00:31:31,652 --> 00:31:33,686
You think you can
do whatever you want?

549
00:31:33,754 --> 00:31:36,021
I am not going
through that again!

550
00:31:36,089 --> 00:31:38,758
Please...

551
00:31:41,561 --> 00:31:44,130
Please...Please...

552
00:31:54,842 --> 00:31:56,209
<i>Find anything?</i>

553
00:31:56,277 --> 00:31:57,377
Shockingly...

554
00:31:57,445 --> 00:31:58,545
<i>A punk kid getting shot</i>

555
00:31:58,613 --> 00:32:00,080
<i>pulling a gun on a cop</i>

556
00:32:00,148 --> 00:32:03,284
did not make
national news.

557
00:32:03,352 --> 00:32:05,253
<i>Is your neck okay?</i>

558
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:06,521
Yeah, it's fine.

559
00:32:08,891 --> 00:32:10,358
I'll get you some ice.

560
00:32:10,426 --> 00:32:12,594
I said it was fine.

561
00:32:12,662 --> 00:32:16,532
I shouldn't have
grabbed you so hard.

562
00:32:20,236 --> 00:32:21,403
You had to.

563
00:32:30,011 --> 00:32:35,248
You were right...
About everything.

564
00:32:47,263 --> 00:32:50,299
Oh, I got something.

565
00:32:50,367 --> 00:32:52,402
Darrien must have had
a different last name then.

566
00:32:52,470 --> 00:32:54,304
She must have been married.

567
00:32:54,372 --> 00:32:56,172
2008?
Is that possible?

568
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:59,876
We never actually talked about
how long she'd been in.

569
00:32:59,944 --> 00:33:01,177
House was right.

570
00:33:01,245 --> 00:33:02,679
She could have only had
her Hep-C for a few years.

571
00:33:02,747 --> 00:33:05,248
There's no way the prison
would have prescribed Interferon

572
00:33:05,316 --> 00:33:08,285
unless the lab showed
her Hep-C to be chronic.

573
00:33:08,353 --> 00:33:12,456
So what makes new Hep-C
looks like old Hep-C?

574
00:33:12,524 --> 00:33:13,557
What if she got a parasite?

575
00:33:13,625 --> 00:33:15,660
The Hep-C made her susceptible

576
00:33:15,728 --> 00:33:17,195
and the parasite sped up
the liver damage.

577
00:33:17,263 --> 00:33:18,763
Entamoeba.

578
00:33:18,831 --> 00:33:20,866
If they were
in a parasitoma,

579
00:33:20,933 --> 00:33:22,367
the stab wound could
have freed them,

580
00:33:22,435 --> 00:33:23,335
sent them coursing
through her bloodstream,

581
00:33:23,402 --> 00:33:25,571
wreaking havoc.

582
00:33:25,639 --> 00:33:28,007
A single bag
of metronidazole.

583
00:33:28,075 --> 00:33:29,308
If we're right,
she could wake up

584
00:33:29,376 --> 00:33:32,479
from the coma
in a few hours.

585
00:33:44,324 --> 00:33:45,724
They're ready for you.

586
00:33:54,166 --> 00:33:55,533
Wait.

587
00:33:59,038 --> 00:34:02,174
I want you in there.

588
00:34:02,241 --> 00:34:04,542
I'm not a surgeon.

589
00:34:04,610 --> 00:34:06,911
<i>There's nothing I can do.</i>

590
00:34:06,979 --> 00:34:09,747
Well, you can make sure that...
Idiot butcher

591
00:34:09,815 --> 00:34:11,483
doesn't cut more than
he needs to.

592
00:34:14,687 --> 00:34:16,687
You already signed a release.

593
00:34:16,755 --> 00:34:18,489
<i>He's gonna do what</i>
<i>he needs to do.</i>

594
00:34:18,556 --> 00:34:23,160
Yeah, and if that involves
chopping off my leg...

595
00:34:23,227 --> 00:34:25,862
<i>I want to be sure</i>

596
00:34:25,930 --> 00:34:29,498
that that's damn well
necessary.

597
00:34:29,566 --> 00:34:32,134
House...

598
00:34:32,202 --> 00:34:35,804
I don't trust him.

599
00:34:35,872 --> 00:34:38,907
I trust you.

600
00:35:13,739 --> 00:35:15,239
Can you hear me?

601
00:35:16,174 --> 00:35:18,642
Yeah.

602
00:35:18,709 --> 00:35:21,311
You had parasites
in your liver.

603
00:35:21,375 --> 00:35:24,877
Probably from a dirty needle
or prison...

604
00:35:24,945 --> 00:35:26,679
Or who knows what?

605
00:35:26,747 --> 00:35:29,615
The stabbing made it worse...

606
00:35:29,683 --> 00:35:31,118
But you're gonna be okay.

607
00:35:42,164 --> 00:35:46,501
I'm sorry.
We had to.

608
00:35:49,309 --> 00:35:51,043
I told you I couldn't go back.

609
00:35:57,677 --> 00:36:00,612
I shouldn't have trusted you.

610
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:02,480
I never liked you.

611
00:36:02,548 --> 00:36:07,285
<i>I killed time with you 'cause</i>
<i>I  was locked in a cage.</i>

612
00:36:07,353 --> 00:36:10,822
You were a distraction.

613
00:36:10,890 --> 00:36:14,160
Someone to talk to so I didn't
have to think about...

614
00:36:14,227 --> 00:36:16,129
everything else.

615
00:36:16,197 --> 00:36:21,034
You're lashing out...
I get it.

616
00:36:21,102 --> 00:36:23,036
But in a month,
you'll thank me.

617
00:36:24,905 --> 00:36:26,873
Or maybe you won't.
I don't know.

618
00:36:26,941 --> 00:36:29,676
But...

619
00:36:29,744 --> 00:36:33,780
I know I saved your life.

620
00:36:52,768 --> 00:36:57,639
Is he going to be okay?

621
00:36:57,707 --> 00:36:59,775
He'll be fine.

622
00:36:59,843 --> 00:37:04,747
Close your eyes.

623
00:37:04,815 --> 00:37:07,917
I wish House still
came over to play.

624
00:37:07,985 --> 00:37:12,955
Well...

625
00:37:13,023 --> 00:37:18,127
Maybe you should
write him a letter.

626
00:37:18,194 --> 00:37:19,795
Want to do that?

627
00:37:19,863 --> 00:37:22,231
Okay, let's do it.

628
00:37:29,038 --> 00:37:31,006
Ruby.

629
00:37:31,074 --> 00:37:33,975
You look like hell
and you smell like--

630
00:37:34,043 --> 00:37:34,910
I've been doing
a lot of thinking.

631
00:37:34,977 --> 00:37:36,044
Is that glitter on you?

632
00:37:36,112 --> 00:37:37,512
Just hear me out.

633
00:37:37,580 --> 00:37:39,948
Back when I still
had my practice,

634
00:37:40,016 --> 00:37:41,450
this patient came in,
50-year-old guy,

635
00:37:41,517 --> 00:37:43,085
wanted a tummy tuck.

636
00:37:43,152 --> 00:37:44,520
But when we
do some prelim work,

637
00:37:44,587 --> 00:37:45,921
we discover that his stomach
is filled with cancer.

638
00:37:45,989 --> 00:37:47,890
So instead of telling him

639
00:37:47,958 --> 00:37:49,058
that he's gonna look great
at the beach,

640
00:37:49,126 --> 00:37:50,259
I got to tell him
that he's dying.

641
00:37:50,327 --> 00:37:51,861
Were you at a strip club?

642
00:37:51,929 --> 00:37:53,830
Please.

643
00:37:53,898 --> 00:37:55,132
The weird part was
I was more upset

644
00:37:55,199 --> 00:37:56,667
about the whole thing
than he was.

645
00:37:56,734 --> 00:37:59,703
He actually had
to calm me down.

646
00:37:59,771 --> 00:38:04,008
Said he had great kids,
raised them right,

647
00:38:04,076 --> 00:38:05,944
knew that because of them,

648
00:38:06,012 --> 00:38:08,312
he was leaving the world
a better place.

649
00:38:10,116 --> 00:38:12,950
I thought I might die
last night.

650
00:38:13,018 --> 00:38:14,318
At a strip club?

651
00:38:14,386 --> 00:38:16,654
Yes, I was at a strip club.

652
00:38:16,722 --> 00:38:19,923
And while it was happening,

653
00:38:19,991 --> 00:38:22,726
I kept thinking about
that patient

654
00:38:22,794 --> 00:38:27,597
and how I wish
I was like him.

655
00:38:31,003 --> 00:38:33,104
I want to have this baby.

656
00:38:49,290 --> 00:38:51,024
Darrien had to shoot
that kid.

657
00:38:51,092 --> 00:38:52,392
It was the right thing.

658
00:38:52,460 --> 00:38:55,062
Completely justified.

659
00:38:55,130 --> 00:38:56,563
But it didn't matter.

660
00:38:56,631 --> 00:39:02,536
She destroyed her life
trying to forget.

661
00:39:02,604 --> 00:39:07,341
I'm afraid that's what's
gonna happen to me.

662
00:39:07,409 --> 00:39:11,512
You really should talk
to someone.

663
00:39:11,579 --> 00:39:14,715
I've talked to a therapist.
It didn't help.

664
00:39:14,783 --> 00:39:16,250
Well, maybe you should
talk to someone

665
00:39:16,318 --> 00:39:21,222
who isn't a therapist.

666
00:39:21,290 --> 00:39:22,824
Do you really think

667
00:39:22,892 --> 00:39:24,559
you have any idea
what it's like

668
00:39:24,627 --> 00:39:27,195
to live with something
like this?

669
00:39:31,367 --> 00:39:33,268
Let's grab a coffee.

670
00:39:36,339 --> 00:39:42,111
? ?

671
00:39:53,291 --> 00:39:56,728
? I am my mother's only one ?

672
00:39:56,795 --> 00:39:59,364
? ?

673
00:39:59,432 --> 00:40:01,567
? it's enough ?

674
00:40:01,634 --> 00:40:07,573
? ?

675
00:40:07,641 --> 00:40:10,008
? I wear my garment ?

676
00:40:10,076 --> 00:40:14,011
? so it shows ?

677
00:40:14,079 --> 00:40:18,382
? now you know ?

678
00:40:18,450 --> 00:40:23,287
? ?

679
00:40:23,355 --> 00:40:24,322
? only love is all maroon ?

680
00:40:24,389 --> 00:40:25,389
Late night?

681
00:40:25,457 --> 00:40:27,324
No.

682
00:40:27,392 --> 00:40:29,793
Just haven't had
my coffee yet.

683
00:40:34,432 --> 00:40:35,832
Sympathetic yawn.

684
00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:37,400
? ?

685
00:40:37,468 --> 00:40:39,169
? sky is womb ?

686
00:40:39,237 --> 00:40:40,871
? she's the moon ?
<i>ooh!</i>

687
00:40:40,939 --> 00:40:42,906
Amish kid collapsed
while picking up a hooker.

688
00:40:42,974 --> 00:40:45,108
Top that.

689
00:40:45,176 --> 00:40:47,377
Missed a call from House
last night.

690
00:40:47,445 --> 00:40:49,112
He in?

691
00:40:49,180 --> 00:40:54,951
? ?

692
00:40:56,787 --> 00:40:58,954
? I am my mother ?

693
00:40:59,022 --> 00:41:02,725
? on the wall ?

694
00:41:02,792 --> 00:41:06,929
? with us all ?

695
00:41:06,996 --> 00:41:09,965
You're lucky.

696
00:41:13,303 --> 00:41:15,438
What are you doing here?

697
00:41:15,505 --> 00:41:19,176
You hoping for someone else?

698
00:41:19,243 --> 00:41:20,277
Hot nurse,

699
00:41:20,345 --> 00:41:22,980
candy striper...

700
00:41:23,048 --> 00:41:24,481
Someone who doesn't
speak English.

701
00:41:24,549 --> 00:41:27,017
<i>Someone who doesn't</i>
<i>speak judgmental.</i>

702
00:41:27,085 --> 00:41:29,086
? Only love is all maroon ?

703
00:41:29,154 --> 00:41:32,389
You've got mail.

704
00:41:32,457 --> 00:41:34,858
<i>"I hope your leg</i>
<i>feels better</i>

705
00:41:34,926 --> 00:41:38,328
"and I hope we can be friends
again soon,

706
00:41:38,396 --> 00:41:40,430
you bloody scallywag."

707
00:41:40,498 --> 00:41:44,300
? Leaving rope burns,
reddish ruse ?

708
00:41:44,367 --> 00:41:46,768
I have to pee.

709
00:41:46,836 --> 00:41:50,072
That's a good sign.

710
00:41:50,139 --> 00:41:53,542
I'm a big boy.

711
00:41:53,610 --> 00:41:56,679
Of course you are.

712
00:42:10,127 --> 00:42:14,564
? Only love is all maroon ?

713
00:42:14,632 --> 00:42:16,266
? ?

714
00:42:16,334 --> 00:42:17,534
You're an ass.

715
00:42:17,601 --> 00:42:20,204
? ?

716
00:42:20,271 --> 00:42:24,308
What, for trying to walk
on a freshly mangled leg?

717
00:42:24,376 --> 00:42:25,877
Performing surgery on myself?

718
00:42:25,945 --> 00:42:27,279
For thinking I could
solve my emotional problems

719
00:42:27,346 --> 00:42:28,280
