1
00:00:37,891 --> 00:00:38,625
Move it!

2
00:00:38,708 --> 00:00:39,976
Faster! Push!

3
00:00:40,046 --> 00:00:41,914
- Quit slacking!
- I'm not slacking.

4
00:00:41,982 --> 00:00:43,048
Is that how you talk
to your drill instructor?

5
00:00:43,116 --> 00:00:44,483
Sir, I'm not slacking.

6
00:00:44,551 --> 00:00:46,152
You stand up.
You look me in the eye!

7
00:00:46,219 --> 00:00:47,520
I feel lousy.
I can't.

8
00:00:47,587 --> 00:00:49,822
"Can't" doesn't exist here!

9
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:51,223
Now, you finish this course,

10
00:00:51,291 --> 00:00:53,459
or you're in isolation the rest
of the day, you hear me?

11
00:00:53,527 --> 00:00:56,095
MacDonald, you ready
to make Parks eat your dust?

12
00:00:56,163 --> 00:00:58,531
Sir, yes, sir!
Ready, go!

13
00:00:58,598 --> 00:01:03,435
Are your ears malfunctioning?
I said go! Go!

14
00:01:03,503 --> 00:01:06,472
Go! Get down!
Get down!

15
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:08,374
Belly down!

16
00:01:08,441 --> 00:01:09,842
Belly down.

17
00:01:09,910 --> 00:01:10,943
Move it!

18
00:01:11,011 --> 00:01:14,580
Get up on there.
You've gotta push.

19
00:01:14,648 --> 00:01:16,248
Move it.
Don't you dare fall.

20
00:01:16,316 --> 00:01:18,184
Grab the bars.
Grab there!

21
00:01:18,251 --> 00:01:20,186
Move it!
Move it! Knees up.

22
00:01:20,253 --> 00:01:22,755
Knees up! Move! Move!

23
00:01:22,823 --> 00:01:25,808
Find the wall!
Hit that wall! Hit that wall!

24
00:01:25,892 --> 00:01:29,028
Move it.
Get up on there.

25
00:01:29,095 --> 00:01:33,232
Don't you fall on me.
Faster! Move it!

26
00:01:37,737 --> 00:01:39,605
What's the matter, Parks?

27
00:01:39,673 --> 00:01:42,241
You got a boo boo?

28
00:01:42,309 --> 00:01:43,609
Sir, I'm bleeding, sir.

29
00:01:43,677 --> 00:01:46,612
- Is your life in immediate danger?
- No.

30
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:49,815
Then you get your ass
up over that wall!

31
00:01:49,883 --> 00:01:53,953
I said get your ass
over the--gaaa!

32
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:55,254
Aah...

33
00:01:55,322 --> 00:01:56,555
What's going on?

34
00:01:56,623 --> 00:01:57,857
My back hurts.

35
00:01:57,924 --> 00:02:00,726
I can't move.

36
00:02:00,794 --> 00:02:04,930
Help. Help.
I can't get up.

37
00:02:04,998 --> 00:02:08,901
"Can't" doesn't exist here.

38
00:02:08,969 --> 00:02:11,237
Get--

39
00:02:13,807 --> 00:02:17,276
? I need it, I need it ?

40
00:02:17,344 --> 00:02:18,444
? I need it ?

41
00:02:22,215 --> 00:02:25,217

43
00:02:31,991 --> 00:02:52,130
? ?

44
00:02:54,681 --> 00:02:56,115
We should not be looking at this.
He sent out an alert.

45
00:02:56,182 --> 00:02:57,283
It would be rude
not to look.

46
00:02:57,350 --> 00:02:59,084
Though I am straining
my eyes.

47
00:02:59,152 --> 00:03:01,987
What are we checking out?
Your profile page.

48
00:03:02,055 --> 00:03:04,990
Why? I haven't--

49
00:03:05,058 --> 00:03:08,794
that...is not me.

50
00:03:08,862 --> 00:03:10,696
That is you.

51
00:03:10,764 --> 00:03:13,532
That's me, but that
is not.

52
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:15,401
Whoever did this
made it smaller.

53
00:03:15,468 --> 00:03:17,136
Much, much smaller.

54
00:03:17,203 --> 00:03:19,405
Whoever did this has
a bone to pick with you.

55
00:03:19,472 --> 00:03:20,923
Ironic, since
your bone is--

56
00:03:21,007 --> 00:03:22,641
is not in that picture.

57
00:03:22,709 --> 00:03:24,143
My proof is right here.
You really want to see it?

58
00:03:24,210 --> 00:03:26,545
Oh, whoa.
Convinced.

59
00:03:26,613 --> 00:03:29,982
You have any idea
who did this?

60
00:03:30,050 --> 00:03:32,318
I don't even know where
the original picture is from.

61
00:03:32,385 --> 00:03:34,586
The bathroom
at the Carlton Hotel.

62
00:03:34,654 --> 00:03:37,022
The towel.
Hotel logo's reversed.

63
00:03:37,090 --> 00:03:38,757
Shot must have been
taken in the mirror.

64
00:03:38,825 --> 00:03:40,993
We were there
for Sanford Wells' wedding.

65
00:03:41,061 --> 00:03:42,428
That must
narrow it down.

66
00:03:42,495 --> 00:03:44,430
He slept with
three women there.

67
00:03:44,497 --> 00:03:46,598
Oh, you're a whore.

68
00:03:51,338 --> 00:03:53,205
? ?

69
00:03:53,273 --> 00:03:55,574
38-year-old former marine

70
00:03:55,642 --> 00:03:57,109
came into the E.R.
with back pain.

71
00:03:57,177 --> 00:03:59,011
Now his bladder aches
as much as his back

72
00:03:59,079 --> 00:04:00,279
because he can't
empty it.

73
00:04:00,347 --> 00:04:02,281
What are we looking at
this morning?

74
00:04:02,349 --> 00:04:03,849
Up-skirt celebrity?

75
00:04:03,917 --> 00:04:05,751
Endearingly funny cat?

76
00:04:05,802 --> 00:04:08,220
Another study about
gays being better parents.

77
00:04:08,288 --> 00:04:10,139
We were lured in
by the word "lesbian."

78
00:04:10,223 --> 00:04:13,025
Has he taken any antihistamines
or anticholinergics?

79
00:04:13,093 --> 00:04:15,728
Nope. And the E.R. ruled out
enlarged prostate,

80
00:04:15,795 --> 00:04:17,596
stopped colon,
and spinal injury.

81
00:04:17,664 --> 00:04:19,698
Military history--

82
00:04:19,766 --> 00:04:21,467
in suspiciously good shape
for his age.

83
00:04:21,534 --> 00:04:23,769
Makes a living
bullying kids.

84
00:04:23,837 --> 00:04:26,438
I'm thinking...Steroids?

85
00:04:26,506 --> 00:04:27,806
Fascinating.

86
00:04:27,874 --> 00:04:30,159
Thanks.
We can wean him off--

87
00:04:30,243 --> 00:04:31,844
steroids isn't fascinating,
it's moronic.

88
00:04:31,911 --> 00:04:34,580
There's no other sign
of hormonal imbalance.

89
00:04:34,647 --> 00:04:36,015
What's fascinating is
that you equate

90
00:04:36,082 --> 00:04:37,649
discipline with bullying.

91
00:04:37,717 --> 00:04:39,718
Which means that your parents
either disciplined you

92
00:04:39,786 --> 00:04:41,787
too much or too little--
I'm guessing too little.

93
00:04:41,855 --> 00:04:45,057
It's hardly surprising you agree
with our patient's philosophy.

94
00:04:45,125 --> 00:04:46,992
You run your department
like a boot camp.

95
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:52,664
As if cruelty ensures
performance.

96
00:04:54,868 --> 00:04:56,402
Oh, is this where I'm supposed
to disagree with you?

97
00:04:56,469 --> 00:04:59,671
The diagnosis of urinary
retention depends on

98
00:04:59,739 --> 00:05:01,140
the particular
mechanical cause.

99
00:05:01,207 --> 00:05:03,142
We need to know if there's
a blockage in the urethra

100
00:05:03,209 --> 00:05:04,910
versus a nerve or a muscle
problem with the bladder.

101
00:05:04,978 --> 00:05:06,979
Fascinating...
Without misdirect.

102
00:05:07,047 --> 00:05:08,714
Cath him and see
what's stopping him

103
00:05:08,782 --> 00:05:10,482
from emptying his bilge.

104
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:12,351
Oh, not you, Chase.

105
00:05:12,419 --> 00:05:14,319
Sending Captain Micropenis
to deal with

106
00:05:14,387 --> 00:05:15,988
what is probably
normal-sized equipment,

107
00:05:16,056 --> 00:05:17,823
it's too cruel,
even for me.

108
00:05:29,702 --> 00:05:31,036
Good morning.

109
00:05:34,541 --> 00:05:37,509
And what brings
the lesser Cuddy to these parts?

110
00:05:37,577 --> 00:05:40,712
Pediatrician appointment
for an s-h-o-t.

111
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:42,414
Waldenwood insists
vaccination reports

112
00:05:42,482 --> 00:05:44,583
go in with
the application.

113
00:05:44,651 --> 00:05:45,551
Honey, finish
your oatmeal.

114
00:05:45,618 --> 00:05:47,252
Waldenwood.

115
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:48,821
Is that by any chance
a boarding school

116
00:05:48,888 --> 00:05:51,790
or a work camp?

117
00:05:51,858 --> 00:05:53,492
It's our first-choice
preschool.

118
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:54,860
Blocks made of gold...

119
00:05:54,928 --> 00:05:56,962
Kids don't have to pick
their own noses...

120
00:05:57,030 --> 00:05:59,331
Great facilities
and teachers.

121
00:05:59,399 --> 00:06:02,434
And they're known
for their gifted program.

122
00:06:02,502 --> 00:06:05,070
You sure that's
the right place for her?

123
00:06:05,138 --> 00:06:08,073
Sounds a little snobby.

124
00:06:08,141 --> 00:06:09,608
I've done my research.
We visited.

125
00:06:09,676 --> 00:06:13,145
It's a perfect fit.

126
00:06:18,485 --> 00:06:20,152
You'll feel pressure.

127
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:21,887
I need you to tell us
when the urge to void

128
00:06:21,955 --> 00:06:23,322
becomes unbearable.
Mm-hmm.

129
00:06:23,389 --> 00:06:24,957
Sorry, can't make you
feel better

130
00:06:25,024 --> 00:06:26,191
till we make you
feel worse.

131
00:06:26,259 --> 00:06:27,759
I get it.

132
00:06:27,827 --> 00:06:29,328
Goes for what I do too.

133
00:06:29,395 --> 00:06:32,331
We cause pain
when it's the only option.

134
00:06:32,398 --> 00:06:34,333
The kids I work with
at the camp are there

135
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:35,667
because a judge
sent them.

136
00:06:35,735 --> 00:06:37,503
I can't teach them
good behaviors

137
00:06:37,570 --> 00:06:39,905
without first getting rid
of all their bad ones.

138
00:06:39,973 --> 00:06:42,241
That's not gonna happen
unless I push them.

139
00:06:42,308 --> 00:06:43,876
I don't see why
metaphorical pushing

140
00:06:43,943 --> 00:06:45,878
has to involve
actual pushing.

141
00:06:45,945 --> 00:06:48,747
I may work these kids hard,
but I never hit them.

142
00:06:48,815 --> 00:06:51,517
You march them into the ground
instead of knocking them there.

143
00:06:51,584 --> 00:06:53,018
Yeah, well, it beats
the alternatives,

144
00:06:53,086 --> 00:06:55,988
which is ending up in jail
or in a gang or...A coffin.

145
00:06:56,055 --> 00:06:57,956
How often do you
pull that off?

146
00:06:58,024 --> 00:06:59,458
Two-thirds
never re-offend.

147
00:06:59,526 --> 00:07:00,859
That's better numbers
than juvie.

148
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:06,665
She's brilliant,
but new to the real world.

149
00:07:06,733 --> 00:07:08,133
Yeah.

150
00:07:08,201 --> 00:07:10,035
Hey, doc,
I gotta go.

151
00:07:10,103 --> 00:07:11,637
Let's empty you out.

152
00:07:11,704 --> 00:07:13,005
Take this urine to Taub.

153
00:07:13,072 --> 00:07:13,906
Have him screen it
for bacteria.

154
00:07:13,973 --> 00:07:15,574
I'll analyze this data.

155
00:07:19,012 --> 00:07:21,747
Half hour on the phone,

156
00:07:21,814 --> 00:07:23,515
no go.

157
00:07:23,583 --> 00:07:25,951
Website won't take down the picture.
I thought their policy

158
00:07:26,019 --> 00:07:27,953
doesn't allow nude photos.

159
00:07:28,021 --> 00:07:29,388
Now tap the tube gently
against the table

160
00:07:29,455 --> 00:07:31,890
to re-suspend the cells.

161
00:07:31,958 --> 00:07:33,192
They don't.

162
00:07:33,259 --> 00:07:38,597
Technically...
I'm no longer nude.

163
00:07:38,665 --> 00:07:41,400
Maybe you should
shut down your account.

164
00:07:41,467 --> 00:07:42,935
I tried, but whoever did this
changed my password,

165
00:07:43,002 --> 00:07:44,303
so I can't even prove
it's my page.

166
00:07:44,370 --> 00:07:45,437
Well, there's a clue.

167
00:07:45,505 --> 00:07:47,039
She's got serious
text skills.

168
00:07:47,106 --> 00:07:49,641
My password was "password."

169
00:07:51,277 --> 00:07:53,111
You're a dumb whore.

170
00:07:53,179 --> 00:07:55,180
Do any of the three seem
like a more likely suspect?

171
00:07:55,248 --> 00:07:57,316
Maybe one was clingier?

172
00:07:57,383 --> 00:07:59,184
I don't even remember
their names.

173
00:07:59,252 --> 00:08:00,819
Listen, this is
a tough time for me.

174
00:08:00,887 --> 00:08:04,022
Breaking up with Rachel,
moving into a hotel.

175
00:08:04,090 --> 00:08:06,058
I want you to know
how much your humiliation

176
00:08:06,125 --> 00:08:08,794
has eased my burden.

177
00:08:15,401 --> 00:08:16,602
Urine is clean
for bacteria.

178
00:08:16,669 --> 00:08:18,370
Not surprising, since
his bladder tests show

179
00:08:18,438 --> 00:08:20,505
that his pain problem
is really a nerve problem.

180
00:08:20,573 --> 00:08:22,307
Neurogenic bladder.
Could mean spinal cord tumor,

181
00:08:22,375 --> 00:08:23,408
cerebral palsy.

182
00:08:23,476 --> 00:08:24,509
House is gonna go
right for syphilis.

183
00:08:24,577 --> 00:08:25,877
How can he be so sure?

184
00:08:25,945 --> 00:08:28,080
Rare complication
of an embarrassing illness.

185
00:08:28,147 --> 00:08:29,281
It's practically
a House special.

186
00:08:29,349 --> 00:08:30,482
I want to get ahead.

187
00:08:30,550 --> 00:08:34,086
Let's go test his blood
for syphilis.

188
00:08:34,153 --> 00:08:35,354
Okay, I'm gonna take
some blood.

189
00:08:35,421 --> 00:08:36,922
This will only hurt
for a second. Ready?

190
00:08:38,591 --> 00:08:42,060
Stop it!
Stop trying to kill me.

191
00:08:42,128 --> 00:08:43,462
Hey, let her go.
That girl was trying to kill me!

192
00:08:43,529 --> 00:08:45,464
Let her go.

193
00:08:45,531 --> 00:08:48,033
Security, get some help in here!
Let me go.

194
00:08:48,101 --> 00:08:49,901
Let me go!

195
00:08:57,108 --> 00:08:58,708
She's fine.
How 'bout we get back

196
00:08:58,768 --> 00:08:59,668
to someone who isn't?

197
00:08:59,730 --> 00:09:01,698
The patient's in restraints
and on Haldol,

198
00:09:01,765 --> 00:09:03,800
- which seems to have made him lucid.
- Differential diagnosis.

199
00:09:03,867 --> 00:09:06,302
Back pain, neurogenic bladder,
psychosis.

200
00:09:06,370 --> 00:09:08,338
A symptom which we learned about
when he choked me.

201
00:09:08,405 --> 00:09:10,373
Hate to slow us down
by acknowledging it.

202
00:09:10,441 --> 00:09:11,674
And yet you have.

203
00:09:11,742 --> 00:09:14,344
Tertiary syphilis fits.

204
00:09:14,411 --> 00:09:15,511
The tests came back
negative.

205
00:09:15,579 --> 00:09:17,680
Several meds could
cause those symptoms.

206
00:09:17,748 --> 00:09:19,916
Tricyclic antidepressants,
ritalin.

207
00:09:19,984 --> 00:09:21,451
Also other native plants.

208
00:09:21,518 --> 00:09:22,986
Wormwood,
jimson weed.

209
00:09:23,053 --> 00:09:25,154
The amount of jimson weed
or ritalin he'd have to ingest,

210
00:09:25,222 --> 00:09:26,155
seems like he would have
mentioned it.

211
00:09:26,223 --> 00:09:28,057
Unless he didn't know
about it.

212
00:09:28,125 --> 00:09:30,627
Maybe one of those kids
at the camp

213
00:09:30,694 --> 00:09:32,862
got tired of Driscoll's lessons
and poisoned him.

214
00:09:36,433 --> 00:09:37,567
Go to the camp.

215
00:09:37,635 --> 00:09:40,369
Check for potential
poisons.

216
00:09:40,421 --> 00:09:43,573
I all but ignored
your assault,

217
00:09:43,641 --> 00:09:45,608
showed you no compassion
whatsoever,

218
00:09:45,676 --> 00:09:48,544
but you came up
with a good idea.

219
00:09:48,612 --> 00:09:49,912
Score one for tough love.

220
00:09:53,951 --> 00:09:56,886
Glad to hear you met
someone you like.

221
00:09:56,937 --> 00:09:57,820
Weddings are good
for that.

222
00:09:57,888 --> 00:09:59,555
I was hoping
to get in touch.

223
00:09:59,623 --> 00:10:01,591
The thing is, I'm
a bit fuzzy on names.

224
00:10:01,659 --> 00:10:04,460
Sorry.
Open bar.

225
00:10:04,528 --> 00:10:06,329
She was sitting
at Dr. Simpson's table.

226
00:10:06,397 --> 00:10:08,665
Brunette, purple dress,
low-cut.

227
00:10:08,732 --> 00:10:10,800
That's my niece,
Winn Phillips.

228
00:10:10,868 --> 00:10:13,269
Your niece?

229
00:10:13,337 --> 00:10:15,672
Fantastic.

230
00:10:15,739 --> 00:10:19,108
Her info is
in your email.

231
00:10:21,245 --> 00:10:23,913
Also, there was a blonde.

232
00:10:23,981 --> 00:10:26,716
Green dress.

233
00:10:26,784 --> 00:10:28,818
You want me to hook you up
with two women?

234
00:10:28,886 --> 00:10:31,154
Actually, three.

235
00:10:34,758 --> 00:10:36,459
How do you cheat
on a test

236
00:10:36,527 --> 00:10:38,461
when there's no test?

237
00:10:38,529 --> 00:10:41,431
Sorry, not playing.

238
00:10:41,498 --> 00:10:45,735
Go away, House.

239
00:10:45,803 --> 00:10:47,203
I am not
giving you advice

240
00:10:47,271 --> 00:10:48,571
just so you can
distort it

241
00:10:48,639 --> 00:10:50,940
to suit your own
warped world view.

242
00:10:51,008 --> 00:10:52,975
But it's been working
so well.

243
00:10:53,043 --> 00:10:55,778
Cuddy wants to get Rachel
into Waldenwood preschool.

244
00:10:55,846 --> 00:10:58,281
The problem is, Rachel's
dumber than a paste sandwich.

245
00:10:58,348 --> 00:11:00,283
And her not getting in
bothers you.

246
00:11:00,350 --> 00:11:03,519
You care about Rachel.
That was not advice.

247
00:11:03,587 --> 00:11:04,887
Cuddy cares about her.

248
00:11:04,955 --> 00:11:08,157
When Rachel gets rejected,
Cuddy will be upset.

249
00:11:08,225 --> 00:11:10,026
And as the boyfriend,
I will be expected

250
00:11:10,094 --> 00:11:11,961
to be supportive
and consoling.

251
00:11:12,029 --> 00:11:14,163
Not your strengths,
I grant you.

252
00:11:14,231 --> 00:11:15,631
Leave it alone.

253
00:11:15,682 --> 00:11:17,433
It's just a play date.
It'll be fine.

254
00:11:17,501 --> 00:11:19,135
Play date being
their code for

255
00:11:19,203 --> 00:11:21,304
way to weed out
the paste sandwiches.

256
00:11:21,371 --> 00:11:23,372
They'll hand her puzzles
and counting games,

257
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:29,078
and Rachel will just sit there
and eat the pieces.

258
00:11:29,146 --> 00:11:32,415
Oh, crap! Crap!
I'm such a sucker!

259
00:11:32,483 --> 00:11:35,518
Thanks for the advice.

260
00:11:35,586 --> 00:11:36,702
That's the isolation area.

261
00:11:36,787 --> 00:11:38,521
Kids who've behaved badly
go there,

262
00:11:38,589 --> 00:11:40,656
sometimes 23 hours a day.

263
00:11:40,707 --> 00:11:42,625
Sound like a pretty good
incentive to behave.

264
00:11:42,693 --> 00:11:46,395
Yeah, by treating the symptom
instead of the disease.

265
00:11:46,463 --> 00:11:48,598
Basic systems theory.

266
00:11:48,665 --> 00:11:51,801
Troubled kids are produced
by troubled families.

267
00:11:51,869 --> 00:11:53,803
This place doesn't even attempt
to change the environment

268
00:11:53,871 --> 00:11:55,905
that damaged them
in the first place.

269
00:11:55,973 --> 00:11:59,075
So there are no bad kids,
only bad parents?

270
00:11:59,143 --> 00:12:00,643
Then why is my brother
an ex-con?

271
00:12:00,711 --> 00:12:05,748
Treating kids decently
doesn't mean identically.

272
00:12:05,816 --> 00:12:11,053
Some kids need more
structure or discipline.

273
00:12:11,121 --> 00:12:14,056
Nobody needs this place.

274
00:12:14,124 --> 00:12:17,160
Maybe we're coming
at this wrong.

275
00:12:17,227 --> 00:12:18,427
We find a poisoner,

276
00:12:18,495 --> 00:12:19,862
and let them point us
toward the poison.

277
00:12:19,930 --> 00:12:22,799
Driscoll's got 24 kids
in his troop.

278
00:12:22,866 --> 00:12:24,033
You want to interview
all of them?

279
00:12:24,101 --> 00:12:26,936
Maybe we don't need to.

280
00:12:27,004 --> 00:12:28,471
Driscoll sent me
to isolation all the time.

281
00:12:28,539 --> 00:12:30,206
It doesn't mean
I poisoned him.

282
00:12:30,257 --> 00:12:32,475
He's the psycho,
not me.

283
00:12:32,543 --> 00:12:35,211
Tell 'em.

284
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:36,245
D.I. Driscoll's
way harder on him

285
00:12:36,313 --> 00:12:37,980
than the rest of us.

286
00:12:38,048 --> 00:12:39,515
Maybe because he's
a bigger pain in the ass.

287
00:12:39,583 --> 00:12:41,150
What are you in here for?

288
00:12:41,218 --> 00:12:42,385
Shoplifting.

289
00:12:42,452 --> 00:12:43,986
You ready to upgrade
to second-degree murder?

290
00:12:44,054 --> 00:12:45,855
Spend ten years in jail?

291
00:12:45,923 --> 00:12:47,423
If he dies because of
whatever you gave him,

292
00:12:47,491 --> 00:12:48,591
that's what'll happen.

293
00:12:48,659 --> 00:12:50,860
That supposed to
scare me?

294
00:12:50,928 --> 00:12:53,062
My mom's dead, my dad's
never been around.

295
00:12:53,130 --> 00:12:53,963
And after this,
I'll get bounced

296
00:12:54,031 --> 00:12:55,164
to another foster home.

297
00:12:55,232 --> 00:12:57,166
My future's
not exactly bright.

298
00:12:57,234 --> 00:12:58,501
Prison now or later
doesn't make that much

299
00:12:58,569 --> 00:12:59,936
of a difference to me.

300
00:13:00,003 --> 00:13:03,573
Dude, I'm not mopping
the whole floor by myself.

301
00:13:05,342 --> 00:13:06,676
Your eyes are red.

302
00:13:06,743 --> 00:13:09,445
Might be an allergic reaction
to the cleaning solution.

303
00:13:09,513 --> 00:13:11,113
It's just my allergies.

304
00:13:11,181 --> 00:13:12,114
Do you take anything
for them?

305
00:13:12,182 --> 00:13:14,684
Not right now.

306
00:13:14,751 --> 00:13:16,252
Why not?

307
00:13:23,961 --> 00:13:26,095
These IV fluids will help

308
00:13:26,163 --> 00:13:27,830
flush the drugs
out of your system.

309
00:13:27,898 --> 00:13:30,600
You know which
of the kids dosed me?

310
00:13:30,667 --> 00:13:33,035
It's not medically
relevant.

311
00:13:33,103 --> 00:13:35,771
Look, I'm not gonna hurt him.

312
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:37,874
But I get why
you're scared of me.

313
00:13:37,941 --> 00:13:41,010
I'm real sorry
about this morning.

314
00:13:41,078 --> 00:13:43,913
No apology necessary.
You're ill.

315
00:13:43,981 --> 00:13:45,781
You didn't know
what you were doing.

316
00:13:49,019 --> 00:13:50,586
I used to be
a real screwup.

317
00:13:50,654 --> 00:13:52,989
The military taught me
that actions

318
00:13:53,056 --> 00:13:54,457
always have consequences.

319
00:13:54,524 --> 00:13:58,961
Part of being a man is
accepting them.

320
00:13:59,029 --> 00:14:01,030
And after all the times
I've said that to the kids,

321
00:14:01,098 --> 00:14:03,566
an apology is necessary.

322
00:14:08,238 --> 00:14:09,939
Are you okay?

323
00:14:10,007 --> 00:14:11,207
My heart's kinda racing.

324
00:14:11,275 --> 00:14:13,709
I got it.

325
00:14:15,812 --> 00:14:19,382
Heart rate is 170.
P.A.T. until proven otherwise,

326
00:14:19,449 --> 00:14:20,583
we've gotta slow it down.
Six milligrams

327
00:14:20,651 --> 00:14:21,584
adenosine, IV bolus.

328
00:14:21,652 --> 00:14:22,585
Tell the nurse to get in here

329
00:14:22,653 --> 00:14:24,553
with the crash cart.

330
00:14:29,346 --> 00:14:31,380
Pushing fluid sent his heart
into overdrive.

331
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:32,447
It took three doses
of adenosine

332
00:14:32,515 --> 00:14:33,748
to get it under control.

333
00:14:33,788 --> 00:14:35,255
Treating him for
antihistamine toxicity

334
00:14:35,323 --> 00:14:36,623
revealed a new symptom,

335
00:14:36,691 --> 00:14:37,991
Which revealed that
he didn't have

336
00:14:38,059 --> 00:14:39,426
antihistamine toxicity
in the first place.

337
00:14:39,494 --> 00:14:40,894
House, where are you?

338
00:14:40,962 --> 00:14:43,764
Playground.
Great place to meet chicks.

339
00:14:43,832 --> 00:14:45,132
Their moms too.

340
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:46,867
Tachycardia could be
a humoral effect--

341
00:14:46,935 --> 00:14:48,202
mastocytosis.

342
00:14:48,269 --> 00:14:49,136
We'd see other GI

343
00:14:49,204 --> 00:14:50,704
or cutaneous symptoms.

344
00:14:50,772 --> 00:14:52,406
Pancreatic insulinoma.

345
00:14:52,474 --> 00:14:53,640
It would cause
bladder problems,

346
00:14:53,708 --> 00:14:55,375
unlike pheochromocytoma.

347
00:14:55,443 --> 00:14:57,311
Well done, Chase.

348
00:14:57,378 --> 00:14:58,412
Now, turn off your phone.

349
00:14:58,480 --> 00:14:59,980
You heard that?
It's on vibrate.

350
00:15:00,048 --> 00:15:01,849
I'm assuming it's been ringing

351
00:15:01,916 --> 00:15:04,318
almost nonstop since you
changed your status update

352
00:15:04,385 --> 00:15:05,853
to "nothing lights my fire

353
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:07,554
"like a lady of size--

354
00:15:07,622 --> 00:15:09,656
less than three bills,
don't bother calling."

355
00:15:09,724 --> 00:15:11,325
Followed by your cell number.

356
00:15:16,231 --> 00:15:17,364
No, no, no, you're right.

357
00:15:17,432 --> 00:15:19,867
This is in no way clever
and hysterical.

358
00:15:19,934 --> 00:15:21,268
Before you start rolling
anyone in flour,

359
00:15:21,336 --> 00:15:22,970
work the patient out
for a pheo.

360
00:15:23,037 --> 00:15:26,206
Adrenaline pituitary scans,
24-hour urine collection.

361
00:15:29,410 --> 00:15:32,179
How soon after
the admissions session

362
00:15:32,247 --> 00:15:33,614
did the child get sick?

363
00:15:33,681 --> 00:15:35,749
The kid barely got home
before she collapsed.

364
00:15:35,817 --> 00:15:38,352
Her parents are a wreck.
Desperate for answers.

365
00:15:38,419 --> 00:15:40,454
Have you experienced
any symptoms,

366
00:15:40,522 --> 00:15:42,656
or does someone else
oversee these sessions?

367
00:15:42,724 --> 00:15:43,891
The teachers supervise.

368
00:15:43,958 --> 00:15:45,325
No one's mentioned
feeling sick.

369
00:15:45,393 --> 00:15:47,728
I'd love to call the family
and offer my support.

370
00:15:47,795 --> 00:15:50,030
Sorry, I can't
reveal names.

371
00:15:50,098 --> 00:15:52,533
Doctor-patient
confidentiality.

372
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:55,435
So this is where all the
admissions play dates happen?

373
00:15:55,503 --> 00:15:57,070
She wouldn't have been
in another room?

374
00:15:57,138 --> 00:15:58,505
This is where
we have them all.

375
00:15:58,573 --> 00:16:00,307
Maybe, to be safe,
we get rid of these toys.

376
00:16:00,375 --> 00:16:01,408
No, no, no,
don't do that.

377
00:16:01,476 --> 00:16:03,377
I'll tell you
if anything's toxic.

378
00:16:03,444 --> 00:16:05,445
For now, you should
minimize your exposure.

379
00:16:21,129 --> 00:16:24,364
I'm supposed to be
supervised.

380
00:16:24,432 --> 00:16:26,466
The scan is pre-programmed.

381
00:16:26,534 --> 00:16:28,001
There's no risk
to the patient.

382
00:16:28,069 --> 00:16:30,837
You're literally gonna
sit here, watch the monitor,

383
00:16:30,905 --> 00:16:31,972
and chat with him
if he gets lonely.

384
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:34,007
Uh...Still.

385
00:16:34,075 --> 00:16:36,543
Report me.

386
00:16:51,159 --> 00:16:52,726
How you doing in there?

387
00:16:52,794 --> 00:16:56,730
You shouldn't bother
trying to protect Landon.

388
00:16:56,798 --> 00:16:58,131
I know he's the one
who drugged me.

389
00:16:58,199 --> 00:17:01,668
The antihistamines aren't
what got you sick.

390
00:17:01,736 --> 00:17:03,737
Doesn't change the fact
that he did it.

391
00:17:06,741 --> 00:17:07,741
I tried everything
with that kid.

392
00:17:07,809 --> 00:17:09,109
I just...

393
00:17:09,177 --> 00:17:12,079
Can't break through.

394
00:17:12,146 --> 00:17:14,014
It's clear you care
about him.

395
00:17:14,082 --> 00:17:16,049
Have you tried
telling him that?

396
00:17:16,117 --> 00:17:17,384
You gotta
understand something.

397
00:17:17,452 --> 00:17:19,586
These kids, they're all
manipulators.

398
00:17:19,654 --> 00:17:21,221
As much as I care
about all of them,

399
00:17:21,289 --> 00:17:23,690
I can't--
I can't show them that

400
00:17:23,758 --> 00:17:25,626
unless there's some
mutual respect.

401
00:17:25,693 --> 00:17:26,994
Otherwise--
forget those other kids.

402
00:17:27,061 --> 00:17:30,530
Think about this kid.

403
00:17:30,598 --> 00:17:32,899
He watched his mother
get sick and die.

404
00:17:32,967 --> 00:17:35,569
He's never known
his dad.

405
00:17:35,637 --> 00:17:37,204
Who knows how long
it's been

406
00:17:37,272 --> 00:17:38,372
since anyone's
taken care of him,

407
00:17:38,439 --> 00:17:39,773
or if there's ever
been a man around

408
00:17:39,841 --> 00:17:44,745
with any degree
of consistency?

409
00:17:44,812 --> 00:17:49,049
I believe that
you're on his side.

410
00:17:49,117 --> 00:17:53,053
I'm betting it would help
if he did.

411
00:17:58,860 --> 00:18:02,362
You are a beautiful man.
Can I leave now?

412
00:18:02,430 --> 00:18:04,464
I know where
all three women are,

413
00:18:04,532 --> 00:18:06,233
but I'd like to avoid
the additional humiliation

414
00:18:06,301 --> 00:18:08,502
of falsely accusing
any of them.

415
00:18:08,569 --> 00:18:09,970
You I.D.Ed the hotel
off this.

416
00:18:10,038 --> 00:18:14,274
I'm hoping there's another clue
in there somewhere.

417
00:18:14,342 --> 00:18:16,410
We could enhance the image.

418
00:18:16,477 --> 00:18:19,413
Maybe her face
is reflected

419
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:22,382
in that gleam
off your butt cheek.

420
00:18:22,450 --> 00:18:25,152
Or maybe it's time
to chalk this up

421
00:18:25,219 --> 00:18:26,787
to the hazards
of being a player.

422
00:18:26,854 --> 00:18:29,856
Your zipper problems
just blew up your marriage.

423
00:18:32,293 --> 00:18:34,695
Don't move.

424
00:18:34,762 --> 00:18:36,196
Unlike me,
you've had the decency

425
00:18:36,264 --> 00:18:38,131
not to cheat on anyone,

426
00:18:38,199 --> 00:18:39,399
but you haven't been
giving much thought

427
00:18:39,467 --> 00:18:42,869
to who these women are,
how they might feel.

428
00:18:42,937 --> 00:18:44,738
Obviously,
you hurt one of them.

429
00:18:44,806 --> 00:18:46,006
Emotionally, you hurt her,

430
00:18:46,074 --> 00:18:48,608
because physically,
how would you even know?

431
00:18:51,412 --> 00:18:55,082
Looks like your shorty
is a shorty.

432
00:19:01,689 --> 00:19:03,290
You're early.
Dinner's not ready.

433
00:19:03,358 --> 00:19:08,395
Oh...Okay.

434
00:19:08,463 --> 00:19:09,730
Rachel and I will
go play in her room.

435
00:19:09,797 --> 00:19:11,064
Really?

436
00:19:11,132 --> 00:19:12,733
I'm hungry. Go cook.

437
00:19:30,618 --> 00:19:33,754
All right, you little
lump of clay...

438
00:19:37,625 --> 00:19:41,528
Rachel. Rachel...

439
00:19:41,596 --> 00:19:43,029
It's a new toy.

440
00:19:43,097 --> 00:19:46,233
What kid doesn't like
new toys?

441
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:48,602
A moron, that's who.

442
00:19:48,669 --> 00:19:52,406
Okay, look at
the pretty colors.

443
00:19:52,473 --> 00:19:56,076
Now, what color is this?

444
00:19:56,144 --> 00:19:58,311
Hmm?

445
00:19:58,379 --> 00:20:01,381
Orange.

446
00:20:01,449 --> 00:20:05,719
Yes, that is orange.
What color is this?

447
00:20:08,289 --> 00:20:12,292
Okay, blocks going away.
Bye-bye blocks.

448
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:15,061
Next time,
reinforce the levees.

449
00:20:15,129 --> 00:20:16,746
Bad Corps of
Army Engineers. Bad!

450
00:20:16,831 --> 00:20:19,299
What's this?

451
00:20:19,367 --> 00:20:21,701
Rings!

452
00:20:21,769 --> 00:20:23,236
Look at the rings.

453
00:20:23,304 --> 00:20:29,042
Now, the goal
of this game is...

454
00:20:30,912 --> 00:20:32,813
To not kill you.

455
00:20:36,184 --> 00:20:37,918
Why are you here?

456
00:20:37,985 --> 00:20:41,087
Wait, did you give me
an std?

457
00:20:41,155 --> 00:20:43,490
No, I did not.
Don't deflect.

458
00:20:43,558 --> 00:20:45,826
That picture was taken
by someone your height.

459
00:20:45,893 --> 00:20:47,928
Just take it down.
What picture?

460
00:20:47,995 --> 00:20:52,199
Fine.
Play it that way.

461
00:21:02,043 --> 00:21:05,612
So, uh...

462
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:07,314
You really like kittens,
huh?

463
00:21:07,381 --> 00:21:09,149
Yeah. You said
you did too.

464
00:21:09,217 --> 00:21:11,218
No wonder you're pissed.

465
00:21:11,285 --> 00:21:13,920
'Cause that is not you.
And I didn't take it.

466
00:21:13,988 --> 00:21:16,623
Did you mean my height
with heels or without?

467
00:21:16,691 --> 00:21:19,426
You weren't wearing heels
when we were in that room--

468
00:21:19,494 --> 00:21:22,095
oh, yes, you were.

469
00:21:22,163 --> 00:21:24,297
I started
to take them off,

470
00:21:24,365 --> 00:21:26,733
and then you asked me
very nicely not to.

471
00:21:26,801 --> 00:21:29,736
Why would I do this?

472
00:21:29,804 --> 00:21:31,638
I mean, I'm not mad about
what happened with us.

473
00:21:31,706 --> 00:21:33,840
Or apparently with you
and any other woman

474
00:21:33,908 --> 00:21:35,108
at that wedding.

475
00:21:35,176 --> 00:21:37,911
Sorry, I guess
my forensic analysis

476
00:21:37,979 --> 00:21:40,213
wasn't as advanced
as I thought.

477
00:21:40,281 --> 00:21:43,049
Wait. You know, you don't
have to rush off.

478
00:21:43,117 --> 00:21:45,218
I still have those heels.

479
00:21:47,989 --> 00:21:51,124
Everywhere you looked,
gingham and stuffed animals.

480
00:21:51,192 --> 00:21:53,193
How did you
get out of there?

481
00:21:53,261 --> 00:21:57,063
I didn't...
Right away.

482
00:21:57,131 --> 00:21:59,266
Wasn't anything wrong
with her physically.

483
00:21:59,333 --> 00:22:01,134
One down, two members
of the threesome to go.

484
00:22:01,202 --> 00:22:02,869
You should flip a condom
to choose.

485
00:22:02,937 --> 00:22:05,572
We checked his adrenal,
pituitary, and thyroid glands.

486
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:07,340
Monitored his catecholamines.

487
00:22:07,408 --> 00:22:08,842
It's not a pheo.

488
00:22:08,910 --> 00:22:10,410
We had to put him on
a diltiazem drip

489
00:22:10,478 --> 00:22:12,012
to regulate his heart.

490
00:22:12,079 --> 00:22:14,281
That means he's
running out of time.

491
00:22:14,348 --> 00:22:15,849
It means you are too.

492
00:22:15,917 --> 00:22:17,817
Your campaign
to soften him up

493
00:22:17,885 --> 00:22:20,320
so he would go easier
on the kids...

494
00:22:20,388 --> 00:22:23,490
All in a pointless attempt
to validate your own upbringing.

495
00:22:24,892 --> 00:22:26,126
Another cardiac
arrhythmia?

496
00:22:26,193 --> 00:22:27,360
Not our patient.

497
00:22:27,428 --> 00:22:31,031
It's the E.R.

498
00:22:31,098 --> 00:22:32,432
That patient
House admitted

499
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:34,267
with back pain
and urinary retention...

500
00:22:34,335 --> 00:22:36,603
How do you feel about
a matched set?

501
00:22:45,383 --> 00:22:47,083
We need to track
your common exposures.

502
00:22:47,198 --> 00:22:48,364
What shampoo
do you use?

503
00:22:48,448 --> 00:22:49,781
Whatever crap
the camp gives us.

504
00:22:49,849 --> 00:22:51,049
Same here.

505
00:22:51,117 --> 00:22:52,451
We need things
exclusive to you,

506
00:22:52,518 --> 00:22:53,752
but not the rest of the camp.

507
00:22:53,820 --> 00:22:55,454
Otherwise, a lot more people
would be sick.

508
00:22:55,521 --> 00:22:56,621
Toothpaste,
deodorant.

509
00:22:56,689 --> 00:22:59,658
Can't be deodorant
making him sick.

510
00:22:59,726 --> 00:23:00,892
He doesn't wear any.
Smells like a--

511
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:02,294
park, shut your mouth.

512
00:23:02,362 --> 00:23:03,495
You're not my drill instructor
in here, okay?

513
00:23:03,563 --> 00:23:05,097
Doesn't mean
you get to be disrespectful.

514
00:23:05,164 --> 00:23:06,198
I can do whatever
the hell I want.

515
00:23:06,265 --> 00:23:08,433
You're not in charge.

516
00:23:08,501 --> 00:23:09,735
There's gotta be a link.

517
00:23:09,802 --> 00:23:12,170
Diet, sexual history,
drug abuse.

518
00:23:12,238 --> 00:23:13,939
No. Believe me, I asked.

519
00:23:14,006 --> 00:23:15,741
Those were some
fun conversations.

520
00:23:15,808 --> 00:23:17,109
Do you believe the answers?

521
00:23:17,176 --> 00:23:18,977
I know the answer to that
is always supposed to be no,

522
00:23:19,045 --> 00:23:20,178
but I did.

523
00:23:20,246 --> 00:23:21,747
Not like the kid has had

524
00:23:21,814 --> 00:23:23,115
much unsupervised time
lately.

525
00:23:23,182 --> 00:23:25,484
Delivery for
Dr. Robert Chase.

526
00:23:25,551 --> 00:23:27,152
That's me.

527
00:23:27,220 --> 00:23:28,920
The camp is in the woods.

528
00:23:28,988 --> 00:23:30,355
There are tons of
opportunities for infection

529
00:23:30,423 --> 00:23:31,790
that not every person
will pick up.

530
00:23:31,858 --> 00:23:32,891
Legionelosis from water,

531
00:23:32,959 --> 00:23:34,860
toxoplasmosis from dirt,

532
00:23:34,927 --> 00:23:36,795
brucellosis from animals.

533
00:23:36,863 --> 00:23:38,397
Too bad none of those explain
his symptoms.

534
00:23:38,464 --> 00:23:43,034
"Casey and Sanford Wells thank
me for my extraordinarily

535
00:23:43,102 --> 00:23:45,404
generous donation
to their wedding charity.

536
00:23:45,471 --> 00:23:47,105
Aww.
Oh, God.

537
00:23:47,173 --> 00:23:49,441
She must have gotten access
to my credit card.

538
00:23:49,509 --> 00:23:50,642
Nocardia fits.

539
00:23:50,710 --> 00:23:52,711
Bacteria lives in the dirt.
They both--

540
00:23:52,779 --> 00:23:55,847
nocardia starts in the lungs,
not the bladder.

541
00:23:55,915 --> 00:23:57,315
How generous is
extraordinarily generous?

542
00:23:57,383 --> 00:23:59,117
Call the charity.

543
00:23:59,185 --> 00:24:00,318
Explain the donation's
a fraud.

544
00:24:00,386 --> 00:24:01,653
And take back Wells'
wedding gift?

545
00:24:01,721 --> 00:24:04,322
You are extraordinarily
screwed.

546
00:24:04,390 --> 00:24:07,592
Bushes can make a happy hunting
ground for ticks, lyme disease.

547
00:24:07,660 --> 00:24:10,195
Neither of our patients
have a rash or tick bite.

548
00:24:10,263 --> 00:24:12,297
40% of lyme patients
don't develop a rash,

549
00:24:12,365 --> 00:24:13,665
and a bite is easy to miss.

550
00:24:13,733 --> 00:24:16,601
Start him on doxycycline
for lyme.

551
00:24:16,669 --> 00:24:19,905
$2,500?

552
00:24:19,972 --> 00:24:22,207
Cancel your credit card,
find that girl,

553
00:24:22,275 --> 00:24:24,676
and marry her.

554
00:24:32,819 --> 00:24:33,919
Chris Stroud,

555
00:24:33,986 --> 00:24:36,354
he approaches the 17th.

556
00:24:36,422 --> 00:24:37,756
Stroud...

557
00:24:39,225 --> 00:24:41,326
Go back.
That was Jersey Shore.

558
00:24:41,394 --> 00:24:42,527
I'm not watching
that crap.

559
00:24:45,731 --> 00:24:47,466
No, let him be
your Guinea pig.

560
00:24:47,533 --> 00:24:49,034
You can dose me after
you're sure you're right.

561
00:24:49,101 --> 00:24:51,970
The side effects
are fairly limited.

562
00:24:52,038 --> 00:24:53,205
And it would be better
to treat you

563
00:24:53,272 --> 00:24:55,540
before you develop
any more symptoms.

564
00:24:55,608 --> 00:24:56,808
I want to wait.

565
00:25:00,012 --> 00:25:01,913
I'm not your drill instructor.

566
00:25:01,981 --> 00:25:04,883
Not trying to break you.

567
00:25:04,951 --> 00:25:07,686
My only job is
to make you better.

568
00:25:07,753 --> 00:25:12,357
I truly believe this medicine
is our best shot.

569
00:25:12,425 --> 00:25:14,993
But whether or not you take it
is up to you.

570
00:25:23,803 --> 00:25:25,804
Is there anything else
i can do for you?

571
00:25:25,872 --> 00:25:29,508
Another pillow would be cool,
if you don't mind.

572
00:25:39,602 --> 00:25:41,686
Hey.

573
00:25:44,390 --> 00:25:45,891
Your turn to pick.

574
00:25:53,432 --> 00:25:56,902
Ready, set,
feed the monkey!

575
00:25:56,969 --> 00:25:59,371
Well, this isn't weird
at all.

576
00:25:59,438 --> 00:26:01,806
She's got the fine
motor skills of The Hulk

577
00:26:01,874 --> 00:26:03,208
in oven mitts.

578
00:26:03,276 --> 00:26:05,844
Do you want a doodle?
Do you?

579
00:26:05,912 --> 00:26:08,997
Feed the monkey.

580
00:26:09,081 --> 00:26:10,916
Cuddy puts her to bed
at 7:30,

581
00:26:10,983 --> 00:26:13,885
which cuts way into
our training time.

582
00:26:13,953 --> 00:26:16,187
Play date's on Friday.

583
00:26:18,891 --> 00:26:20,191
What is that?

584
00:26:20,259 --> 00:26:22,127
Dog training clicker.

585
00:26:22,194 --> 00:26:24,062
Gives immediate
positive reinforcement,

586
00:26:24,130 --> 00:26:26,097
bridging the precious seconds

587
00:26:26,165 --> 00:26:29,034
between desired behavior
and treat delivery.

588
00:26:29,101 --> 00:26:31,269
House, she's not a dog.

589
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:33,972
It really seems
to be working.

590
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:36,141
Does Cuddy know
that Rachel's here,

591
00:26:36,208 --> 00:26:37,776
and that you're turning her
into a schnauzer?

592
00:26:37,843 --> 00:26:39,144
I told marina
that Rachel and I

593
00:26:39,211 --> 00:26:42,180
are working on a secret
art project for mommy.

594
00:26:42,248 --> 00:26:43,782
Which means that
some pedes patient

595
00:26:43,849 --> 00:26:45,917
is about to be short
one art project.

596
00:26:45,985 --> 00:26:48,019
The sacrifices we make
for our children's education.

597
00:26:49,789 --> 00:26:54,960
Who's a good girl?
Who's a good girl?

598
00:26:55,027 --> 00:26:56,595
It had to be you.

599
00:26:56,662 --> 00:26:57,963
I gave you my credit card
to pay for drinks.

600
00:26:58,030 --> 00:26:59,264
And I gave it back.

601
00:26:59,332 --> 00:27:01,499
I didn't take the picture.
Now go away.

602
00:27:01,550 --> 00:27:04,002
Well, forgive me
if I'm not convinced.

603
00:27:04,070 --> 00:27:05,670
You're obviously
pissed at me.

604
00:27:05,738 --> 00:27:07,606
Because I thought
we totally had a connection.

605
00:27:07,673 --> 00:27:09,407
And then when you didn't
ask me for my number, I--

606
00:27:09,475 --> 00:27:12,777
a connection?
It was a threesome.

607
00:27:12,845 --> 00:27:14,279
Yeah, but you were obviously
more into me

608
00:27:14,347 --> 00:27:15,914
than you were into Nika.

609
00:27:15,982 --> 00:27:17,816
Kenzie, honey,
you have a phone call.

610
00:27:17,883 --> 00:27:19,651
Just a minute, dad.

611
00:27:19,702 --> 00:27:21,152
I didn't want to
say anything in front of her,

612
00:27:21,220 --> 00:27:22,621
but you could have.

613
00:27:22,688 --> 00:27:24,656
You live
with your parents?

614
00:27:24,724 --> 00:27:26,257
Just until graduation.

615
00:27:26,325 --> 00:27:29,294
College?

616
00:27:29,362 --> 00:27:30,462
How old are you?

617
00:27:30,529 --> 00:27:33,598
18...Next month.

618
00:27:33,666 --> 00:27:36,401
Relax, it's not illegal
or anything.

619
00:27:36,469 --> 00:27:38,937
Look, I just need this
to stop.

620
00:27:39,005 --> 00:27:40,171
Would you give it up
already?

621
00:27:40,239 --> 00:27:41,706
I told you,
it's not me.

622
00:27:41,774 --> 00:27:44,275
My parents won't even let me on
social networking sites.

623
00:27:44,343 --> 00:27:46,011
Too many sexual predators.

624
00:27:55,321 --> 00:27:57,122
Stop him.

625
00:27:57,189 --> 00:27:59,924
Hey, hey.
Where you going?

626
00:27:59,992 --> 00:28:01,660
Hey, you're sick.

627
00:28:01,727 --> 00:28:02,761
You need to be
in the hospital.

628
00:28:02,828 --> 00:28:04,095
There's a million hospitals.

629
00:28:04,163 --> 00:28:05,096
Ones that won't send me back
to that camp!

630
00:28:05,164 --> 00:28:06,698
Landon, what's going on?

631
00:28:06,766 --> 00:28:09,734
Please, help me.
Don't send me back.

632
00:28:09,802 --> 00:28:11,503
Those are my car keys.
You stole them out of my pocket?

633
00:28:11,570 --> 00:28:13,271
No bad kids, huh?

634
00:28:15,107 --> 00:28:17,142
Did you stop Landon?

635
00:28:17,209 --> 00:28:18,510
Yeah, yeah.
What's wrong?

636
00:28:18,577 --> 00:28:20,745
Oh, my legs, they hurt.
The muscles are in a vise.

637
00:28:20,796 --> 00:28:24,215
What does it mean?
I'm not sure yet.

638
00:28:24,283 --> 00:28:25,750
Ten Diazepam.
40 potassium.

639
00:28:32,531 --> 00:28:35,331
The leg pain was caused by
a muscle cramp from low sodium,

640
00:28:35,385 --> 00:28:37,019
which was caused by
kidney dysfunction.

641
00:28:37,087 --> 00:28:38,887
Landon didn't respond
to doxycycline either.

642
00:28:38,955 --> 00:28:40,789
I think we can
rule out lyme.

643
00:28:40,857 --> 00:28:42,708
I thought I was
getting through to him,

644
00:28:42,776 --> 00:28:44,276
and he just wanted
to steal my car keys.

645
00:28:44,344 --> 00:28:45,377
If only his previous
behavior

646
00:28:45,445 --> 00:28:47,413
had given you a reason
to expect that.

647
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:50,449
Why are you putting
hot sauce on a toy?

648
00:28:50,517 --> 00:28:52,484
Maybe you don't care
if children chew

649
00:28:52,552 --> 00:28:54,887
on your caterpillar.
I think it's wrong.

650
00:28:54,954 --> 00:28:58,624
What causes kidney dysfunction
on top of everything else?

651
00:28:58,691 --> 00:28:59,958
Arsenic poisoning.

652
00:29:00,026 --> 00:29:02,795
And people do change.

653
00:29:02,862 --> 00:29:04,096
Driscoll took it
to heart

654
00:29:04,164 --> 00:29:05,564
when I asked him
to think about

655
00:29:05,632 --> 00:29:07,900
Landon's history.

656
00:29:07,967 --> 00:29:09,701
He was much nicer,
and then--

657
00:29:09,769 --> 00:29:12,037
Wow, two ideas that
don't make any sense.

658
00:29:12,105 --> 00:29:14,473
If it was arsenic,
they'd be puking and pooping.

659
00:29:14,541 --> 00:29:17,142
And conversations
with moralizing strangers

660
00:29:17,210 --> 00:29:19,545
do not make people change
their behavior.

661
00:29:25,518 --> 00:29:28,020
Rachel is not gonna do that
more than once.

662
00:29:30,990 --> 00:29:33,926
Whipple's could affect
the brain, kidneys, heart.

663
00:29:33,993 --> 00:29:35,227
Not without G.I. involvement.

664
00:29:35,295 --> 00:29:36,528
Why is it impossible
to believe

665
00:29:36,596 --> 00:29:39,665
I made a compelling
argument, and he--

666
00:29:39,732 --> 00:29:42,000
if he changed, it's because
something besides you

667
00:29:42,068 --> 00:29:43,469
made that argument
compelling.

668
00:29:43,536 --> 00:29:44,636
Compromised kidneys

669
00:29:44,704 --> 00:29:45,871
secondary
to bladder issues

670
00:29:45,939 --> 00:29:48,841
points to botulism toxin,
which lives in soil.

671
00:29:48,908 --> 00:29:50,676
Got into the kid's bloodstream

672
00:29:50,743 --> 00:29:52,478
through the cut
on his forehead.

673
00:29:52,545 --> 00:29:53,512
Got into the drill
instructor's

674
00:29:53,580 --> 00:29:54,780
through some abrasions
on his feet.

675
00:29:56,649 --> 00:29:59,151
Good idea.

676
00:29:59,219 --> 00:30:00,552
Give 'em both
the antitoxin.

677
00:30:06,693 --> 00:30:08,861
I saw my chance
to get out of here.

678
00:30:08,928 --> 00:30:10,696
I had to take it.

679
00:30:10,763 --> 00:30:11,880
Don't make excuses.

680
00:30:11,948 --> 00:30:13,465
You tried to steal
from me.

681
00:30:13,533 --> 00:30:14,833
Oh, these kids are
manipulators.

682
00:30:14,901 --> 00:30:16,301
You can't let
your guard down.

683
00:30:16,369 --> 00:30:18,137
What do you mean
"all these kids"?

684
00:30:18,204 --> 00:30:19,972
Don't lump me in with
the losers at that camp.

685
00:30:20,039 --> 00:30:20,939
Seems like you
belong there.

686
00:30:21,007 --> 00:30:22,808
It may be
your only chance.

687
00:30:22,876 --> 00:30:24,243
Look, I've screwed up,

688
00:30:24,310 --> 00:30:25,911
but I've never been
in trouble with the law.

689
00:30:25,979 --> 00:30:29,515
You said you were in
for shoplifting.

690
00:30:29,582 --> 00:30:31,283
Store owner caught me trying
to boost some chips and stuff.

691
00:30:31,351 --> 00:30:34,720
Called my DCS caseworker.

692
00:30:34,787 --> 00:30:36,221
I thought all the kids
were there under court order.

693
00:30:36,289 --> 00:30:37,956
That's usually how it works.

694
00:30:38,024 --> 00:30:39,858
So why is he different?

695
00:30:46,533 --> 00:30:48,867
Why would I take
a naked picture of you?

696
00:30:48,935 --> 00:30:50,769
You're cute,
but you're not that cute.

697
00:30:50,837 --> 00:30:52,004
Now please go.

698
00:30:52,071 --> 00:30:54,173
You're the only one left.
You're pissed off.

699
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:55,474
I'm pissed off because
you're in my apartment,

700
00:30:55,542 --> 00:30:57,042
and my boyfriend might
be here any minute.

701
00:30:57,110 --> 00:30:59,344
Boyfriend.

702
00:30:59,412 --> 00:31:01,613
Last thing I want to do
is publicize

703
00:31:01,681 --> 00:31:04,383
that I cheated on him,
so why would I prank you?

704
00:31:04,450 --> 00:31:06,418
And where was this boyfriend
at the wedding?

705
00:31:06,486 --> 00:31:08,887
Out of town.
Conveniently.

706
00:31:12,075 --> 00:31:14,026
It's from my sister's
birthday last month.

707
00:31:14,093 --> 00:31:16,061
And before you suggest
he's my brother,

708
00:31:16,129 --> 00:31:18,063
note how I'm kissing him.

709
00:31:18,131 --> 00:31:20,199
You used me, I used you.
It was a mistake.

710
00:31:20,266 --> 00:31:22,284
Now I just want
to forget about it.

711
00:31:29,309 --> 00:31:31,376
I just got off the phone
with Landon's DCS caseworker.

712
00:31:31,444 --> 00:31:32,678
You were right.

713
00:31:32,745 --> 00:31:35,847
I'm not what made
my argument compelling.

714
00:31:45,692 --> 00:31:46,992
Where are we going?

715
00:31:47,060 --> 00:31:49,194
To give your bladder
an antibiotic wash

716
00:31:49,262 --> 00:31:50,495
to protect against
infection.

717
00:32:00,406 --> 00:32:03,842
Who are you?
I'm Dr. House.

718
00:32:03,910 --> 00:32:08,947
And that boy is the spitting
image of his mother.

719
00:32:09,015 --> 00:32:11,783
Of course,
I've never seen her,

720
00:32:11,851 --> 00:32:13,752
but his care worker told
my lackey

721
00:32:13,820 --> 00:32:18,357
that you paid his
enrollment fee at the camp.

722
00:32:18,424 --> 00:32:20,392
That could mean that
you're a family friend,

723
00:32:20,460 --> 00:32:22,628
but then, why hide it?

724
00:32:22,695 --> 00:32:26,198
The only person
who'd want to hide it...

725
00:32:26,266 --> 00:32:29,268
Is his deadbeat dad,

726
00:32:29,335 --> 00:32:33,105
who has decided not
to be a deadbeat anymore.

727
00:32:36,309 --> 00:32:39,077
Please, don't tell him.

728
00:32:44,250 --> 00:32:47,319
We spend days looking
for a link between them,

729
00:32:47,387 --> 00:32:49,788
and he doesn't tell us
the kid is his son.

730
00:32:49,856 --> 00:32:51,523
We were looking for
exposures.

731
00:32:51,591 --> 00:32:53,592
He didn't think
it was medically relevant.

732
00:32:53,660 --> 00:32:55,427
Soon, he won't have to worry
about his kidding finding out.

733
00:32:55,495 --> 00:32:58,564
Being dead makes
keeping secrets much easier.

734
00:32:58,631 --> 00:33:00,599
Neither one was responding
to botulism treatment,

735
00:33:00,667 --> 00:33:02,201
and the boy started
having seizures.

736
00:33:02,268 --> 00:33:04,036
And Driscoll might
have been right

737
00:33:04,104 --> 00:33:05,604
that their biological
relationship doesn't matter.

738
00:33:05,672 --> 00:33:07,806
Genetic illness emerges
when people are the same age,

739
00:33:07,874 --> 00:33:10,209
not during the same week.
Unless there's a trigger.

740
00:33:10,276 --> 00:33:12,411
Genetic conditions
can be set off

741
00:33:12,479 --> 00:33:13,612
by things in the surroundings,

742
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:15,314
and these two obviously
share surroundings.

743
00:33:15,382 --> 00:33:17,549
That's a relatively
rare phenomenon.

744
00:33:17,617 --> 00:33:19,418
Which is our specialty,
I know.

745
00:33:19,486 --> 00:33:23,055
Our patients are related.
That can't be a coincidence.

746
00:33:25,492 --> 00:33:26,892
I just had an idea.

747
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:30,262
Relevant to our case?

748
00:33:30,330 --> 00:33:32,297
No.

749
00:33:32,365 --> 00:33:34,566
Sit.

750
00:33:34,634 --> 00:33:37,169
Wegener's can be brought on
by exposure to heavy metals.

751
00:33:37,237 --> 00:33:39,505
Did you see anything at the camp?
Near the isolation hut,

752
00:33:39,572 --> 00:33:42,141
there were some old
generator batteries.

753
00:33:42,208 --> 00:33:43,809
Could have leaked
into the soil?

754
00:33:43,877 --> 00:33:45,044
Seems like someone else
in the camp

755
00:33:45,111 --> 00:33:46,645
would have had lead poisoning.

756
00:33:46,713 --> 00:33:48,113
You got anything better?

757
00:33:50,383 --> 00:33:53,652
Treat with cyclophosphamide.

758
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:54,920
Go find your bliss.

759
00:33:57,957 --> 00:34:00,659
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have a play date.

760
00:34:09,102 --> 00:34:14,673
Why didn't you step forward
when his mom died?

761
00:34:14,741 --> 00:34:18,477
I found out she'd passed
months later.

762
00:34:18,545 --> 00:34:24,183
By then, Landon was already
in the foster system.

763
00:34:24,250 --> 00:34:26,585
I was figuring out
a way to approach him

764
00:34:26,653 --> 00:34:28,120
when he got into trouble,

765
00:34:28,188 --> 00:34:31,757
so I brought him
to the camp.

766
00:34:31,825 --> 00:34:33,859
You need to tell him.

767
00:34:33,927 --> 00:34:37,729
I can't.
Not now.

768
00:34:37,797 --> 00:34:40,332
If I die, the only thing
I'll ever be to him

769
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:42,668
is the hardass who made him
run obstacle courses.

770
00:34:45,305 --> 00:34:46,872
You'll apologize to me
for something done

771
00:34:46,940 --> 00:34:48,340
in a psychotic state,

772
00:34:48,408 --> 00:34:50,042
but you won't own up
to being his father.

773
00:34:50,110 --> 00:34:52,244
What happened to
"actions have consequences,

774
00:34:52,312 --> 00:34:54,646
a man accepts them"?

775
00:34:54,714 --> 00:34:56,348
I'm in his life,

776
00:34:56,416 --> 00:34:59,985
and I am working to get him
on the right path.

777
00:35:00,053 --> 00:35:04,957
He doesn't need
a drill instructor.

778
00:35:05,024 --> 00:35:07,659
He needs a dad.

779
00:35:12,966 --> 00:35:16,001
It's so sweet of you
coming to this.

780
00:35:16,069 --> 00:35:17,936
Just trying to be
supportive.

781
00:35:18,004 --> 00:35:21,340
I've heard that's
what boyfriends do.

782
00:35:22,909 --> 00:35:26,645
Hi, honey. Hi.
Did you have fun?

783
00:35:26,713 --> 00:35:29,515
Yeah?

784
00:35:31,184 --> 00:35:34,486
Rachel had a great time.
Played with everything.

785
00:35:34,554 --> 00:35:35,687
She's a very clever girl.

786
00:35:39,459 --> 00:35:43,061
I'm sorry to ask this,
but we've had some problems

787
00:35:43,129 --> 00:35:44,463
with parents coaching kids.

788
00:35:44,531 --> 00:35:47,766
Rachel caught onto our toys
unusually quickly,

789
00:35:47,834 --> 00:35:50,636
and she even knew the game
was called "Feed the Monkey."

790
00:35:50,703 --> 00:35:54,806
Uh, well, as eager as I am
to have her go here,

791
00:35:54,874 --> 00:35:57,910
I promise you
I would never do that.

792
00:35:59,612 --> 00:36:00,913
Hey, Rachel,

793
00:36:00,980 --> 00:36:03,448
have you ever played
"Feed the Monkey" before?

794
00:36:07,153 --> 00:36:08,353
No, mama.

795
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:15,961
She seemed so dumb,

796
00:36:16,029 --> 00:36:19,514
but when the pressure was on,
she knew what had to be done,

797
00:36:19,599 --> 00:36:21,733
and she did it.

798
00:36:21,801 --> 00:36:23,268
You're pumped
'cause your kid lied?

799
00:36:23,336 --> 00:36:28,340
She's not my kid.
She's a pain in the ass.

800
00:36:28,408 --> 00:36:31,276
And she's a better liar
than you are.

801
00:36:31,344 --> 00:36:35,080
You didn't cut your leg
getting into your truck.

802
00:36:35,148 --> 00:36:37,516
The abrasion has dirt
and gravel in it.

803
00:36:37,584 --> 00:36:39,751
A bit of fertilizer too.

804
00:36:39,819 --> 00:36:42,454
Tripped in my greenhouse.

805
00:36:42,521 --> 00:36:43,989
Growing my own
organic veggies.

806
00:36:44,057 --> 00:36:47,326
Didn't ask.
Not gonna tell.

807
00:36:47,393 --> 00:36:50,829
She didn't hesitate.
She didn't oversell.

808
00:36:50,897 --> 00:36:53,832
Took me years to learn
how to lie like that.

809
00:36:53,900 --> 00:36:55,534
And Rachel has it
on instinct.

810
00:36:55,602 --> 00:36:57,669
Sounds like you're
real fond of that kid.

811
00:36:57,737 --> 00:37:01,573
You're really not good
with nuance, are you?

812
00:37:01,641 --> 00:37:03,875
I admire her talent.

813
00:37:03,943 --> 00:37:05,344
I'm just gonna
numb you up...

814
00:37:11,551 --> 00:37:13,952
I gotta go.

815
00:37:18,825 --> 00:37:21,593
Latest kidney function test
shows no improvement.

816
00:37:21,661 --> 00:37:24,730
Nice stitches.
Do they hurt?

817
00:37:24,797 --> 00:37:26,965
No. They gave me
a shot of something.

818
00:37:27,033 --> 00:37:28,734
That was Lidocaine.

819
00:37:28,801 --> 00:37:30,535
It triggered an underlying
genetic condition

820
00:37:30,603 --> 00:37:32,838
called variegate porphyria.

821
00:37:32,905 --> 00:37:35,774
That would explain
their symptoms.

822
00:37:35,842 --> 00:37:37,876
But I didn't
have any Lidocaine.

823
00:37:37,944 --> 00:37:39,411
But you had a handful
of antihistamines,

824
00:37:39,479 --> 00:37:41,980
courtesy of the deviant
in the next bed.

825
00:37:42,048 --> 00:37:43,582
It's also a porphyria
trigger.

826
00:37:43,650 --> 00:37:48,153
Wait, so we have the same
genetic thing?

827
00:37:48,221 --> 00:37:49,655
Yeah...

828
00:37:49,722 --> 00:37:51,456
Small world.

829
00:37:51,524 --> 00:37:53,558
This is good news.

830
00:37:53,626 --> 00:37:56,194
We can manage the condition
with hematin.

831
00:37:56,262 --> 00:37:59,398
A liver transplant
could cure it.

832
00:38:01,668 --> 00:38:07,272
Sometimes two patients share
one donated liver.

833
00:38:07,340 --> 00:38:09,741
Would that work for us?

834
00:38:09,809 --> 00:38:11,610
Possibly.

835
00:38:11,678 --> 00:38:13,345
We'd have to test your blood,
tissue type.

836
00:38:13,413 --> 00:38:15,180
And if they matched--
why would they?

837
00:38:15,248 --> 00:38:17,316
Just because we have
the same thing making us sick...

838
00:38:17,383 --> 00:38:19,851
Also...

839
00:38:22,221 --> 00:38:26,024
I'm your father.

840
00:38:37,904 --> 00:38:39,271
I don't believe you.

841
00:38:39,339 --> 00:38:42,808
You don't think a white guy
can be a bad father?

842
00:38:42,875 --> 00:38:45,377
Happy to check your DNA.

843
00:38:45,445 --> 00:38:47,179
Do you really think he'd say
he's your dad if he isn't?

844
00:38:47,246 --> 00:38:49,781
It's not like you're a catch.

845
00:38:59,692 --> 00:39:01,293
You're evil.

846
00:39:05,598 --> 00:39:08,633
Barely recognize you
with your clothes on.

847
00:39:08,701 --> 00:39:11,770
You were at the wedding
with your sister.

848
00:39:11,838 --> 00:39:13,305
Shared a room
with her too.

849
00:39:13,373 --> 00:39:17,275
I came by to change
my shoes, and...

850
00:39:17,343 --> 00:39:19,578
I found you
in the bathroom.

851
00:39:19,645 --> 00:39:21,646
It took you long enough
to find me.

852
00:39:21,714 --> 00:39:23,014
Because when someone
starts pranking you,

853
00:39:23,082 --> 00:39:25,484
the logical suspect is
the overly protective sister

854
00:39:25,551 --> 00:39:26,785
of the woman
you slept with once.

855
00:39:26,853 --> 00:39:29,988
This has nothing to do
with my sister.

856
00:39:30,056 --> 00:39:31,089
Then what does it have
to do with?

857
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:35,660
If you really have
no clue,

858
00:39:35,728 --> 00:39:37,796
then you so deserve this.

859
00:39:37,864 --> 00:39:40,532
All that creativity
and energy

860
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:42,467
you put into
pranking me...

861
00:39:42,535 --> 00:39:43,969
It seems like you were
trying to make a point.

862
00:39:44,036 --> 00:39:47,873
You really don't want
to tell me what it was?

863
00:39:47,940 --> 00:39:51,009
You're a really big fan
of John Hughes movies.

864
00:39:51,077 --> 00:39:53,945
You inexplicably prefer
Some Kind of Wonderful

865
00:39:54,013 --> 00:39:56,214
to Sixteen Candles, though
that's probably because...

866
00:39:56,282 --> 00:39:59,084
Mary Stuart Masterson looked hot
in those leather gloves.

867
00:39:59,152 --> 00:40:01,887
We talked
at the reception.

868
00:40:01,954 --> 00:40:04,956
That's why you hate me?
It was fun.

869
00:40:05,024 --> 00:40:07,259
It was great...
Until I mentioned that

870
00:40:07,326 --> 00:40:09,060
I don't sleep with guys
on the first date.

871
00:40:09,128 --> 00:40:11,930
And then you said you had
to go to the bathroom,

872
00:40:11,998 --> 00:40:13,465
and you never came back.

873
00:40:13,533 --> 00:40:16,802
Actions have consequences.

874
00:40:16,869 --> 00:40:18,970
Do you seek vengeance
on every guy

875
00:40:19,038 --> 00:40:20,205
who acts like an ass?

876
00:40:20,273 --> 00:40:21,840
Could be a full-time job.

877
00:40:23,743 --> 00:40:26,478
When we were talking,
you seemed like a nice guy.

878
00:40:26,546 --> 00:40:29,047
So either you're
a great actor,

879
00:40:29,115 --> 00:40:30,649
or you're a nice guy
who lost his way.

880
00:40:30,716 --> 00:40:32,050
Whatever the reasons,

881
00:40:32,118 --> 00:40:38,056
a little negative reinforcement
seemed to be warranted.

882
00:40:38,124 --> 00:40:40,692
Oh, currently, your password is
"great big ho."

883
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:44,029
Change it back to anything
but "password."

884
00:40:44,096 --> 00:40:48,233
Hey, I'm--I'm sorry.

885
00:40:50,736 --> 00:40:52,737
Let me prove it to you
by taking you out to dinner.

886
00:40:52,805 --> 00:40:55,073
Followed by not
sleeping with you.

887
00:40:58,778 --> 00:41:02,047
I'm serious.

888
00:41:02,114 --> 00:41:05,383
Not on your life.

889
00:41:14,327 --> 00:41:17,762
? all his life ?

890
00:41:17,830 --> 00:41:24,002
? owned by wildfire ?

891
00:41:24,070 --> 00:41:28,006
? like a spark ?

892
00:41:28,074 --> 00:41:30,709
We need to talk.

893
00:41:30,776 --> 00:41:33,044
Nothin' to say.

894
00:41:33,112 --> 00:41:36,181
? ?

895
00:41:36,249 --> 00:41:39,718
Okay.

896
00:41:39,785 --> 00:41:41,653
I'll wait till you're ready.

897
00:41:48,094 --> 00:41:52,564
You're my son.

898
00:41:52,632 --> 00:41:55,667
I'm not going anywhere.

899
00:42:03,509 --> 00:42:10,815
? ?

900
00:42:12,685 --> 00:42:14,953
Wait a minute.

901
00:42:15,021 --> 00:42:17,088
What is that?
A doggy.

902
00:42:17,156 --> 00:42:18,823
What does it say?
Ruff!

903
00:42:18,891 --> 00:42:20,325
That's right.

904
00:42:22,962 --> 00:42:24,329
Waldenwood called.

905
00:42:24,397 --> 00:42:26,431
They love Rachel,
but they have no room.

906
00:42:29,602 --> 00:42:31,536
Something about more
siblings than usual.

907
00:42:31,604 --> 00:42:35,840
We should apply
next year.

908
00:42:37,944 --> 00:42:41,112
She's a smart kid.
She'll be fine.

909
00:42:41,180 --> 00:42:43,982
You mean that?

910
00:42:44,050 --> 00:42:47,152
Yeah, I do.

911
