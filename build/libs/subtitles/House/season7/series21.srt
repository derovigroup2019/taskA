1
00:00:02,922 --> 00:00:05,310
I have been fantasizing
about this for months.

2
00:00:05,411 --> 00:00:06,641
Forget it.
We're not here to fool around.

3
00:00:06,708 --> 00:00:08,871
I'm not fooling around.

4
00:00:08,939 --> 00:00:11,536
I need this.

5
00:00:11,603 --> 00:00:13,670
You're an idiot.
You know that?

6
00:00:13,738 --> 00:00:15,601
Just shut up
and give me a boost.

7
00:00:24,425 --> 00:00:25,891
<i>Hurry your ass up.</i>

8
00:00:51,339 --> 00:00:52,472
Hey, sometimes a guy's
got to do

9
00:00:52,571 --> 00:00:55,105
What a guy's got to do.

10
00:00:55,173 --> 00:00:56,739
Jaguar one to control.

11
00:00:56,806 --> 00:00:58,540
Uh, sorry for the delay.

12
00:00:58,608 --> 00:01:01,875
Glenn had to take a leak.
It was unavoidable.

13
00:01:01,943 --> 00:01:03,109
Target area is clear.

14
00:01:03,177 --> 00:01:05,546
Target area
confirmed clear.

15
00:01:10,953 --> 00:01:13,122
Dr. Lee, target area
is cleared.

16
00:01:13,189 --> 00:01:15,090
Launch vehicle's in range.
All systems go.

17
00:01:15,158 --> 00:01:16,725
Thank you, Cesar.
Whenever you're ready.

18
00:01:16,792 --> 00:01:19,728
The CT-10's light enough
to launch from a UAV,

19
00:01:19,796 --> 00:01:21,964
but can penetrate 8 feet
of 6,000-psi concrete

20
00:01:22,031 --> 00:01:23,500
before detonation.

21
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:24,307
<i>Bomb's away.</i>

22
00:01:24,389 --> 00:01:25,656
Precision guidance system's
not affected

23
00:01:25,723 --> 00:01:27,325
by darkness or weather
and can hit

24
00:01:27,392 --> 00:01:30,246
a 2-foot-wide target
from 69,000 feet.

25
00:01:30,631 --> 00:01:31,597
<i>What about sound?</i>

26
00:01:31,665 --> 00:01:33,198
None inbound at all.

27
00:01:33,266 --> 00:01:34,599
We've developed
a new fan

28
00:01:34,667 --> 00:01:36,467
and a baffling
design that--

29
00:01:36,535 --> 00:01:40,037
ordnance on target
in three, two, one.

30
00:01:49,613 --> 00:01:51,113
I feel better already.

31
00:01:51,181 --> 00:01:55,149
You need to see a shrink.

32
00:01:55,217 --> 00:01:57,919
Seriously.

33
00:01:59,754 --> 00:02:00,854
Well done.

34
00:02:00,922 --> 00:02:03,323
Wendy!

35
00:02:03,391 --> 00:02:06,126

Massive Attack's <i>? Teardrop ?</i>

39
00:03:03,348 --> 00:03:04,983
Karma's a bitch.

40
00:03:05,012 --> 00:03:07,214
You think her seizures
are the result of bad karma?

41
00:03:07,263 --> 00:03:08,296
I think if you
spend your days

42
00:03:08,364 --> 00:03:09,831
designing ever more
effective ways

43
00:03:09,899 --> 00:03:12,767
to blow people up, stuff's
bound to come back to you.

44
00:03:22,858 --> 00:03:24,759
Thirsty.

45
00:03:24,827 --> 00:03:26,461
<i>Side effect of</i>
<i>a new antihistamine I'm on.</i>

46
00:03:26,528 --> 00:03:27,862
You don't seem congested.

47
00:03:27,930 --> 00:03:29,931
Hmm, intriguing.

48
00:03:29,999 --> 00:03:32,167
You have any thoughts
about our patient?

49
00:03:32,235 --> 00:03:33,468
Got some questions
about whether Thirteen

50
00:03:33,536 --> 00:03:35,671
really believes in karma
or just wants to.

51
00:03:35,739 --> 00:03:37,105
<i>As for the patient,</i>

52
00:03:37,173 --> 00:03:38,574
it's not gonna be easy
to break into her office.

53
00:03:38,642 --> 00:03:39,942
Might want to start
with her home.

54
00:03:40,010 --> 00:03:41,276
<i>We could ask to look</i>

55
00:03:41,344 --> 00:03:43,612
through her office
and we could do an MRI first.

56
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,380
Sure. Go ahead.

57
00:03:46,983 --> 00:03:48,149
If you're not interested
in the case,

58
00:03:48,217 --> 00:03:49,818
<i>why'd you take it?</i>

59
00:03:49,885 --> 00:03:51,386
I am definitely interested.

60
00:03:51,453 --> 00:03:53,888
<i>Could be a tumor.</i>
<i>Could be a CNS bleed.</i>

61
00:03:53,956 --> 00:03:55,790
What do you do when you got
two interesting puzzles?

62
00:03:55,857 --> 00:03:57,191
Two?

63
00:03:58,393 --> 00:03:59,927
50 bucks!

64
00:03:59,994 --> 00:04:01,528
Pay up.

65
00:04:07,002 --> 00:04:08,769
? Uh mmm mmm ?

66
00:04:11,106 --> 00:04:13,842
Let's go. Let's go.

67
00:04:13,909 --> 00:04:14,943
<i>Bet's off.</i>

68
00:04:15,011 --> 00:04:16,278
Fight was fixed.

69
00:04:16,346 --> 00:04:18,247
<i>That punch barely</i>
<i>touched him.</i>

70
00:04:18,315 --> 00:04:20,716
You bet on Foley
to beat Zachary?

71
00:04:20,784 --> 00:04:22,185
Speed beats power...

72
00:04:22,252 --> 00:04:23,353
<i>Unless speed</i>
<i>has been paid</i>

73
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:25,789
to speedily take a dive.

74
00:04:25,856 --> 00:04:27,157
He touched him enough
to put him on the canvas

75
00:04:27,224 --> 00:04:28,525
and the official
counted him out,

76
00:04:28,592 --> 00:04:30,359
which means you
officially owe me

77
00:04:30,427 --> 00:04:33,163
50 bucks.

78
00:04:33,230 --> 00:04:34,931
We bet on
a sporting event.

79
00:04:34,999 --> 00:04:36,199
That was not sporting.

80
00:04:36,267 --> 00:04:38,201
Less than 30 seconds.

81
00:04:38,269 --> 00:04:40,136
<i>That was barely</i>
<i>even event-y.</i>

82
00:04:40,204 --> 00:04:41,938
Okay, here's what I saw.

83
00:04:42,006 --> 00:04:43,340
You lost and I won.

84
00:04:43,407 --> 00:04:44,875
Yeah, well, you can
take that to your grave.

85
00:04:44,943 --> 00:04:45,809
You're not taking
my 50 bucks.

86
00:04:45,877 --> 00:04:46,777
<i>Prove it.</i>

87
00:04:46,844 --> 00:04:48,279
Prove it or pay up.

88
00:04:48,346 --> 00:04:49,880
You got one day.

89
00:04:49,948 --> 00:04:52,350
And don't make me send my boys
out looking for you.

90
00:04:52,418 --> 00:04:53,618
What?

91
00:04:58,525 --> 00:05:01,227
All right.

92
00:05:01,294 --> 00:05:03,396
<i>So, two puzzles.</i>

93
00:05:03,463 --> 00:05:04,797
Tie goes to the one
that costs me money.

94
00:05:04,865 --> 00:05:06,332
Keep each other posted.

95
00:05:10,236 --> 00:05:12,136
I've always been healthy.

96
00:05:12,204 --> 00:05:13,938
I never even get colds.

97
00:05:14,006 --> 00:05:15,706
I guess your luck
finally ran out.

98
00:05:18,543 --> 00:05:20,577
I take it she doesn't
like people who makes bombs.

99
00:05:20,645 --> 00:05:22,579
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to.

100
00:05:22,647 --> 00:05:23,747
It's all right.

101
00:05:23,814 --> 00:05:26,683
Half of my family feels
the same way.

102
00:05:26,751 --> 00:05:31,522
Of course they all work
on Wall Street, so...

103
00:05:31,590 --> 00:05:33,824
Ever since the first
4th of July I can remember,

104
00:05:33,892 --> 00:05:36,828
I've always loved explosions.

105
00:05:36,896 --> 00:05:38,830
<i>When I got to college</i>
<i>and I had to pick a major,</i>

106
00:05:38,898 --> 00:05:41,767
figured I might as well pick
something I'm passionate about.

107
00:05:41,834 --> 00:05:43,202
Destroying things.

108
00:05:43,269 --> 00:05:45,003
You weren't passionate
about anything else?

109
00:05:46,539 --> 00:05:49,608
Bombs are tools,
just like anything else.

110
00:05:49,676 --> 00:05:51,543
<i>You can use it</i>
<i>to make things better</i>

111
00:05:51,611 --> 00:05:53,245
or you can use it
to make things worse.

112
00:05:53,312 --> 00:05:55,614
<i>I also like romantic poetry</i>

113
00:05:55,682 --> 00:05:57,449
and picnics.

114
00:05:57,517 --> 00:05:58,450
Is there anything else
you want to know

115
00:05:58,518 --> 00:05:59,484
before we do this MRI?

116
00:05:59,552 --> 00:06:01,653
Nope.

117
00:06:01,721 --> 00:06:02,788
Try to stay as still
as possible.

118
00:06:02,855 --> 00:06:05,757
This shouldn't take long.

119
00:06:10,196 --> 00:06:11,530
Hey, how's it going?

120
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:15,434
You mind?

121
00:06:15,501 --> 00:06:16,334
I mean, there are plenty
of other seats.

122
00:06:16,402 --> 00:06:17,836
I'm not here to judge.

123
00:06:17,904 --> 00:06:19,371
You did what was best
for you

124
00:06:19,438 --> 00:06:21,206
and I got no problem
with that.

125
00:06:21,273 --> 00:06:23,241
I'm not gonna ask you
nice again.

126
00:06:23,309 --> 00:06:24,509
Just go away.
Or what?

127
00:06:24,577 --> 00:06:26,545
You're suddenly gonna
fall down?

128
00:06:26,613 --> 00:06:28,514
Listen.
I got a problem.

129
00:06:28,582 --> 00:06:32,218
A guy who knows absolutely
nothing about boxing,

130
00:06:32,286 --> 00:06:34,621
because of you,
now thinks he does.

131
00:06:34,689 --> 00:06:36,690
You can imagine
the potential ramifications.

132
00:06:36,758 --> 00:06:38,192
I need you to get
on the phone with him

133
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:39,994
and tell him
you took a dive.

134
00:06:40,062 --> 00:06:41,362
I didn't take a dive.

135
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:42,630
Take a picture of you
to prove that it was really you

136
00:06:42,698 --> 00:06:44,732
and we're done.

137
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,034
Just enough to convince him.

138
00:06:46,101 --> 00:06:47,869
Not enough to get you
in any trouble.

139
00:06:47,937 --> 00:06:51,039
I didn't take a dive.

140
00:06:51,107 --> 00:06:52,841
Yeah.

141
00:06:52,909 --> 00:06:54,409
That story's
getting boring.

142
00:06:54,477 --> 00:06:56,078
Look, I'm not
from the commission.

143
00:06:56,146 --> 00:06:57,746
I'm not some bookie.

144
00:06:57,814 --> 00:06:59,982
I'm a doctor.
This is my I.D.

145
00:07:03,454 --> 00:07:05,254
Look, if you were
a bookie,

146
00:07:05,322 --> 00:07:07,023
you'd know no one pays a guy
to throw a fight

147
00:07:07,091 --> 00:07:08,525
he has no chance to win.

148
00:07:08,592 --> 00:07:10,593
I was a 12-to-1 underdog.

149
00:07:10,661 --> 00:07:12,129
Lost my last five fights.

150
00:07:12,196 --> 00:07:13,763
But you were
the better fighter.

151
00:07:13,831 --> 00:07:16,333
That last punch
barely touched you.

152
00:07:16,401 --> 00:07:17,868
You ever been barely touched
by a guy

153
00:07:17,935 --> 00:07:20,270
who weighs 230 pounds?

154
00:07:20,338 --> 00:07:21,471
Look at me.

155
00:07:21,539 --> 00:07:24,808
Look where I am,
what I'm wearing.

156
00:07:24,875 --> 00:07:27,277
Now, do I look like a guy
who just got a payday?

157
00:07:27,345 --> 00:07:31,247
I didn't throw the fight.

158
00:07:31,315 --> 00:07:34,684
I just suck.

159
00:07:41,125 --> 00:07:43,093
Ha!

160
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:49,200
Proof.

161
00:07:49,268 --> 00:07:52,270
Just because he wasn't
hit in the face--

162
00:07:52,338 --> 00:07:53,805
Look at his pupils.

163
00:07:53,873 --> 00:07:57,476
He has anisocoria,
which, given his age,

164
00:07:57,544 --> 00:07:59,044
the adrenaline surge
of the fight,

165
00:07:59,112 --> 00:08:00,145
the fact that
he's still alive

166
00:08:00,213 --> 00:08:01,814
means he was tachycardic.

167
00:08:01,882 --> 00:08:04,082
He has Wolff-Parkinson-White
syndrome.

168
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:05,283
The bet was on
who would win,

169
00:08:05,351 --> 00:08:06,384
not who would
live the longest.

170
00:08:06,452 --> 00:08:08,754
If he's physically unable
to continue

171
00:08:08,821 --> 00:08:10,855
because of
a preexisting illness,

172
00:08:10,923 --> 00:08:12,523
then it's technically
a "no contest,"

173
00:08:12,591 --> 00:08:14,892
which means
all bets are off.

174
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:16,560
You know that just
because I was right

175
00:08:16,628 --> 00:08:18,195
about this one fighter
doesn't make you

176
00:08:18,263 --> 00:08:19,396
any less of a man?

177
00:08:19,464 --> 00:08:21,898
Actually,
it would if you were right.

178
00:08:21,966 --> 00:08:23,399
Then as I said earlier,
prove it.

179
00:08:23,467 --> 00:08:25,769
And one possibly photoshopped
cell phone pic

180
00:08:25,836 --> 00:08:28,038
does not a diagnosis make.

181
00:08:33,378 --> 00:08:34,344
<i>Oh, excuse me, Dr. House.</i>

182
00:08:34,412 --> 00:08:36,880
<i>Desole, je parle pas anglais.</i>

183
00:08:36,948 --> 00:08:38,982
I'm a co-worker
of Wendy Lee's.

184
00:08:39,050 --> 00:08:40,684
I'm also her boyfriend.

185
00:08:40,752 --> 00:08:42,686
Great.
I'm a guy who doesn't care.

186
00:08:42,754 --> 00:08:44,321
She's your patient.

187
00:08:44,388 --> 00:08:46,356
Oh, you thought I didn't
know who Wendy Lee was?

188
00:08:46,424 --> 00:08:48,491
Yeah, makes sense.
I'm not good at names.

189
00:08:48,558 --> 00:08:49,892
Did Dr. Fortune
tell you that?

190
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:51,393
Her last boyfriend
was a real nut.

191
00:08:51,461 --> 00:08:52,561
He's basically stalking her.

192
00:08:52,629 --> 00:08:53,895
See, this is what
I don't care about.

193
00:08:53,963 --> 00:08:55,497
I don't care who cares
about her.

194
00:08:55,564 --> 00:08:57,198
Used to care about her.

195
00:08:57,266 --> 00:09:00,235
Either one you falls down dead,
you can drop me a note.

196
00:09:00,302 --> 00:09:02,270
I think I know what's wrong
with her.

197
00:09:02,337 --> 00:09:04,672
You screwed up
in the lab

198
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:07,676
and accidentally spilled
some bomb on her?

199
00:09:07,744 --> 00:09:09,445
No.

200
00:09:09,512 --> 00:09:13,083
He really is crazy.

201
00:09:13,150 --> 00:09:15,252
Poisoned?

202
00:09:15,319 --> 00:09:17,087
Apparently our mad scientist

203
00:09:17,155 --> 00:09:19,089
is also a slutty scientist

204
00:09:19,157 --> 00:09:21,359
whose milkshakes got all
the nerds in the yard

205
00:09:21,427 --> 00:09:22,994
fighting over her.

206
00:09:23,062 --> 00:09:25,196
She's a slut because she's dated
two different guys at work?

207
00:09:25,264 --> 00:09:26,497
Oh, I'm sorry.

208
00:09:26,565 --> 00:09:27,731
I thought we were
still judging her.

209
00:09:27,799 --> 00:09:29,366
She's not a slut
and it's not poison.

210
00:09:29,434 --> 00:09:31,301
When we tested her blood
and cerebral spinal fluid

211
00:09:31,369 --> 00:09:32,602
for toxic exposure,
it was negative

212
00:09:32,670 --> 00:09:33,803
for every poison
we could think of.

213
00:09:33,871 --> 00:09:35,004
Well, that just leaves

214
00:09:35,072 --> 00:09:36,739
every poison we didn't
think of.

215
00:09:36,807 --> 00:09:38,641
<i>She works in a bomb factory.</i>

216
00:09:38,709 --> 00:09:39,709
<i>So do a lot of other not-sick people.</i>

217
00:09:39,776 --> 00:09:41,143
The guy had any
actual evidence

218
00:09:41,211 --> 00:09:42,511
she was poisoned, he would
have gone to the police,

219
00:09:42,579 --> 00:09:44,213
not to us.

220
00:09:44,281 --> 00:09:45,481
And if we had any evidence
of what was wrong with her,

221
00:09:45,549 --> 00:09:46,582
you'd be showing us
MRI results.

222
00:09:46,650 --> 00:09:49,619
I assume they were negative.

223
00:09:49,686 --> 00:09:51,488
Couldn't hurt to start activated
charcoal, see what happens.

224
00:09:51,556 --> 00:09:53,090
You know what else
wouldn't hurt?

225
00:09:53,158 --> 00:09:55,092
This case is getting
interesting.

226
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:56,727
Let's add a little danger.

227
00:10:10,174 --> 00:10:11,908
Hmm.

228
00:10:18,182 --> 00:10:19,449
Just because he has guns

229
00:10:19,516 --> 00:10:21,718
doesn't make him a murderer.

230
00:10:21,785 --> 00:10:23,085
Tell that to the bear.
<i>Look in the desk.</i>

231
00:10:23,153 --> 00:10:24,987
See if he's got a diary
or a journal.

232
00:10:25,055 --> 00:10:26,555
Something tells me he's
not exactly

233
00:10:26,623 --> 00:10:27,623
a diary kind of guy.

234
00:10:27,691 --> 00:10:29,125
Maybe a manifesto.

235
00:10:29,192 --> 00:10:30,326
Just look.

236
00:10:30,393 --> 00:10:31,627
I'm gonna check out
the rest of the place,

237
00:10:31,695 --> 00:10:33,062
see if he's got a computer.

238
00:10:33,130 --> 00:10:35,131
It's Foreman.
Yep?

239
00:10:35,198 --> 00:10:36,299
<i>You break in yet?</i>

240
00:10:36,366 --> 00:10:37,367
Yeah, we're in
the abattoir now.

241
00:10:37,434 --> 00:10:38,735
Why?
<i>You can leave.</i>

242
00:10:38,802 --> 00:10:40,803
I think Taub and I found
what we're looking for.

243
00:10:42,239 --> 00:10:44,840
Looks like she actually
was being poisoned,

244
00:10:44,908 --> 00:10:47,109
but she's been doing it
to herself.

245
00:10:49,784 --> 00:10:51,319
I'm not an alcoholic.
I know.

246
00:10:51,387 --> 00:10:53,154
I know the whole label thing
is so limiting.

247
00:10:53,222 --> 00:10:56,625
You're a person who happens
to suffer from alcoholism.

248
00:10:56,693 --> 00:10:59,929
You broke into my house and now
you're being a smartass?

249
00:10:59,996 --> 00:11:02,465
During your history, you said
you didn't drink at all.

250
00:11:02,533 --> 00:11:03,700
I don't.

251
00:11:03,767 --> 00:11:06,969
- You just collect bottles.
- Yes.

252
00:11:07,037 --> 00:11:08,270
I collect them for my friend.

253
00:11:08,338 --> 00:11:10,539
She uses them
in her art projects.

254
00:11:10,606 --> 00:11:11,706
And you're ashamed
of these art projects.

255
00:11:11,774 --> 00:11:13,208
The bottles were hidden.

256
00:11:13,276 --> 00:11:16,111
That's because my housekeeper
keeps throwing them out.

257
00:11:16,178 --> 00:11:17,712
I've told her
a dozen times not to,

258
00:11:17,780 --> 00:11:20,148
but either she doesn't
understand or she doesn't care.

259
00:11:22,785 --> 00:11:25,086
- Why would she lie?
- That's the easy question.

260
00:11:25,154 --> 00:11:27,222
She needs a government security
clearance for her job.

261
00:11:27,290 --> 00:11:28,523
And what's
the hard question?

262
00:11:28,591 --> 00:11:30,058
If she's an alcoholic,
why doesn't she have

263
00:11:30,126 --> 00:11:32,494
at least some partially-full
bottles in the house?

264
00:11:32,562 --> 00:11:33,729
I mean, why keep
the empties?

265
00:11:33,797 --> 00:11:35,097
Why not just
throw them away?

266
00:11:35,165 --> 00:11:37,600
So she's probably
telling the truth.

267
00:11:37,668 --> 00:11:40,303
So what do we do?

268
00:11:40,371 --> 00:11:45,074
We start her on valium
for alcohol withdrawal.

269
00:11:45,142 --> 00:11:47,677
It's the best
we've got right now.

270
00:11:53,783 --> 00:11:57,119
One normal EKG does not
a healthy person make.

271
00:11:57,186 --> 00:11:58,754
Look, I told you
I just suck.

272
00:11:58,821 --> 00:12:00,855
Oh, you make me so sad.

273
00:12:00,923 --> 00:12:02,957
- Don't talk like that.
- Why do you care so much?

274
00:12:03,025 --> 00:12:04,993
Kill me for loving
my patients.

275
00:12:05,060 --> 00:12:06,327
It's just what I do.

276
00:12:08,297 --> 00:12:10,765
Hey, stop.
Stop!

277
00:12:14,369 --> 00:12:16,504
Look, my--my leg hurts.
Okay?

278
00:12:16,572 --> 00:12:17,739
Just talk to me
for a moment.

279
00:12:26,817 --> 00:12:28,485
You don't have
to be a loser.

280
00:12:28,552 --> 00:12:30,688
Thanks.

281
00:12:30,755 --> 00:12:32,223
Whatever's wrong with you,
it's real.

282
00:12:32,291 --> 00:12:33,891
Sick is good.

283
00:12:33,959 --> 00:12:34,993
Sick means
you can get better.

284
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:36,628
<i>You could get better.</i>

285
00:12:36,696 --> 00:12:38,730
And I don't mean healthier.

286
00:12:38,798 --> 00:12:41,233
I mean...

287
00:12:41,301 --> 00:12:43,535
Maybe you don't
have to suck.

288
00:12:48,808 --> 00:12:50,708
Figure out what's wrong
with yourself.

289
00:12:50,776 --> 00:12:52,143
Leave me alone.

290
00:12:59,050 --> 00:13:01,017
<i>Abdominal pain.</i>

291
00:13:01,085 --> 00:13:03,553
She said it felt like
she was being stabbed.

292
00:13:03,621 --> 00:13:05,322
Ah!

293
00:13:05,390 --> 00:13:07,424
Give her morphine,
5 milligrams IV.

294
00:13:07,492 --> 00:13:09,793
Is it a symptom
of the underlying condition

295
00:13:09,861 --> 00:13:11,561
or a symptom
of our treatment?

296
00:13:11,629 --> 00:13:13,597
We'll know soon.
I stopped her treatment.

297
00:13:13,665 --> 00:13:15,433
We should restart it.

298
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:16,434
Acute pancreatitis
from alcoholism

299
00:13:16,501 --> 00:13:17,401
would cause
this kind of pain.

300
00:13:17,469 --> 00:13:18,770
It's stress related.

301
00:13:18,837 --> 00:13:20,572
She's in a lot of pain.
She's under a lot of stress.

302
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:22,073
She's got two guys
fighting over her

303
00:13:22,141 --> 00:13:24,108
and she got done with
the final test of a new bomb.

304
00:13:24,176 --> 00:13:26,143
<i>Her guilt is killing her.</i>

305
00:13:26,211 --> 00:13:27,278
As far as you know,
she likes being the center

306
00:13:27,345 --> 00:13:28,512
of attention
and loves her job.

307
00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:29,980
As far as you know,
she doesn't drink.

308
00:13:30,048 --> 00:13:31,148
<i>What if it's a kidney infection?</i>

309
00:13:31,215 --> 00:13:32,349
Acute pyelonephritis
could kill her

310
00:13:32,416 --> 00:13:34,551
if we don't
start her on IV antibiotics.

311
00:13:34,618 --> 00:13:35,885
<i>Would</i> kill her if
it was pyelonephritis,

312
00:13:35,953 --> 00:13:37,353
but since her urine
and CSF

313
00:13:37,421 --> 00:13:38,354
<i>don't show signs</i>
<i>of infection--</i>

314
00:13:38,422 --> 00:13:41,391
I paged House.

315
00:13:41,458 --> 00:13:43,693
What?
We got nothing.

316
00:13:43,761 --> 00:13:45,729
Less than nothing since he's
actually ignoring my pages,

317
00:13:45,796 --> 00:13:47,397
<i>which means we have</i>
<i>a sick patient</i>

318
00:13:47,465 --> 00:13:49,333
<i>and apparently a sick boss.</i>

319
00:14:05,418 --> 00:14:06,685
Tell him you admit
he's right.

320
00:14:06,753 --> 00:14:09,154
Let's get him back
to work.

321
00:14:09,222 --> 00:14:11,390
If he's ignoring you,
it's because he trusts you.

322
00:14:11,457 --> 00:14:12,691
No, it's not.

323
00:14:12,758 --> 00:14:13,958
No, it's not,
but he does.

324
00:14:14,026 --> 00:14:15,327
Thanks.
I feel warm inside.

325
00:14:15,394 --> 00:14:16,928
Right now I'm debating

326
00:14:16,996 --> 00:14:19,097
which bad idea I should
pretend is a good idea

327
00:14:19,165 --> 00:14:20,666
and force everybody
to implement.

328
00:14:20,733 --> 00:14:22,967
I think this is
good for him.

329
00:14:23,035 --> 00:14:24,502
Obsessing over a bet
is good?

330
00:14:24,570 --> 00:14:26,204
And doing his actual job,
treating actual patients,

331
00:14:26,272 --> 00:14:27,606
that's bad?

332
00:14:27,673 --> 00:14:29,208
House only doing
what House wants

333
00:14:29,276 --> 00:14:30,810
is the only way
he can function.

334
00:14:30,878 --> 00:14:32,211
<i>Since the breakup,</i>
<i>he's been seeking out</i>

335
00:14:32,279 --> 00:14:36,550
crazier and crazier things
to do because they're crazy.

336
00:14:36,618 --> 00:14:40,453
This is--well,
it's not crazy.

337
00:14:40,521 --> 00:14:42,322
No, just irresponsible
and possibly dangerous.

338
00:14:42,390 --> 00:14:43,690
By House standards,
it's dull.

339
00:14:43,758 --> 00:14:45,458
<i>This he's doing</i>

340
00:14:45,526 --> 00:14:46,793
just because he's interested.

341
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:49,361
I think House
getting back to doing...

342
00:14:49,429 --> 00:14:51,362
Stupid House stuff
for stupid House reasons

343
00:14:51,430 --> 00:14:54,065
is the best thing
that could happen to him.

344
00:14:54,133 --> 00:14:57,768
I'll go explain that
to the patient.

345
00:15:48,652 --> 00:15:50,353
It's definitely not pancreatitis.

346
00:15:50,421 --> 00:15:53,790
Restarting the treatment
obviously didn't help anything.

347
00:15:53,858 --> 00:15:56,359
<i>I assume you tested</i>
<i>for infections.</i>

348
00:15:56,427 --> 00:15:57,927
And I assume that look means
"yes, and I was wrong."

349
00:15:57,995 --> 00:15:59,696
You call for a psych consult?

350
00:15:59,763 --> 00:16:01,231
<i>Wow.</i>

351
00:16:01,298 --> 00:16:02,833
<i>That's the same look</i>
<i>I just got from Chase.</i>

352
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:04,735
So an hour ago,
we had three theories

353
00:16:04,802 --> 00:16:06,169
we couldn't agree on.

354
00:16:06,237 --> 00:16:08,305
Now we've got no theories,
but we're in agreement.

355
00:16:11,609 --> 00:16:14,244
CT and ultrasound
showed inflammation

356
00:16:14,312 --> 00:16:16,046
in the renal capsule.

357
00:16:16,114 --> 00:16:17,381
Could be
an obstructing calculus

358
00:16:17,449 --> 00:16:19,416
or a perinephric abscess.

359
00:16:19,484 --> 00:16:20,551
Blood cultures
came back negative.

360
00:16:20,618 --> 00:16:22,052
It's probably just
a benign cyst.

361
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:23,754
Yes, let's just dismiss an idea
because it's probably nothing.

362
00:16:23,821 --> 00:16:24,955
<i>Could be gas in the perinephric space,</i>

363
00:16:25,023 --> 00:16:26,090
in which case,
we should be prepping her

364
00:16:26,158 --> 00:16:27,224
for emergency surgery.

365
00:16:29,527 --> 00:16:31,662
What looks like
Wolff-Parkinson-White

366
00:16:31,729 --> 00:16:33,363
<i>but isn't?</i>

367
00:16:35,833 --> 00:16:38,735
Her EKG was normal.
<i>So was his.</i>

368
00:16:38,803 --> 00:16:40,203
That's why I said "looks like."

369
00:16:40,271 --> 00:16:42,505
As in similar to,
but not the same.

370
00:16:42,573 --> 00:16:46,842
You want us to help you
get out of paying your bet

371
00:16:46,910 --> 00:16:49,178
while your actual patient
lies in agony.

372
00:16:49,246 --> 00:16:52,415
Who's the real
bad guy here?

373
00:16:52,482 --> 00:16:53,949
The guy who doesn't
care enough to help

374
00:16:54,017 --> 00:16:57,353
or the four guys who are
not competent enough to help?

375
00:16:57,421 --> 00:16:58,921
He works out too much,
gets pounded too much,

376
00:16:58,989 --> 00:17:00,823
and not in the romantic way.

377
00:17:00,890 --> 00:17:02,725
<i>His pupils--</i>
I got it.

378
00:17:05,195 --> 00:17:06,361
Your patient?
No.

379
00:17:06,429 --> 00:17:07,196
<i>Plenty of time</i>
<i>to save her life</i>

380
00:17:07,263 --> 00:17:09,398
after we save my money.

381
00:17:09,466 --> 00:17:11,200
Underlying neurological
condition

382
00:17:11,268 --> 00:17:13,836
<i>exacerbated by an acute UTI</i>
<i>brought on</i>

383
00:17:13,904 --> 00:17:15,505
by her sexual escapades.

384
00:17:15,573 --> 00:17:16,606
Slut?
Escapades?

385
00:17:16,674 --> 00:17:17,507
How do we treat?
A Scarlet "A"?

386
00:17:17,575 --> 00:17:18,508
<i>Sorry.</i>

387
00:17:18,575 --> 00:17:19,909
Acute UTI brought on

388
00:17:19,977 --> 00:17:22,078
by her healthy enjoyment
of her womanhood.

389
00:17:22,145 --> 00:17:24,547
We start her on IV ampicillin
and an aminoglycoside.

390
00:17:34,324 --> 00:17:35,758
You ignore us all the time.

391
00:17:35,826 --> 00:17:37,627
You go on crazy joyrides
all the time.

392
00:17:37,694 --> 00:17:41,531
<i>But you answer pages,</i>
<i>you sleep.</i>

393
00:17:41,599 --> 00:17:43,599
I know I'm gonna
regret doing this,

394
00:17:43,667 --> 00:17:45,335
but I'll ask anyway.

395
00:17:45,402 --> 00:17:49,806
Is there anything
I can do to help?

396
00:17:49,874 --> 00:17:51,741
Although...

397
00:18:07,157 --> 00:18:09,958
<i>Great news!</i>

398
00:18:10,026 --> 00:18:13,127
You have an underlying
neurological condition,

399
00:18:13,195 --> 00:18:14,995
which together
with your heart--

400
00:18:15,063 --> 00:18:16,330
you said
my heart was fine.

401
00:18:16,398 --> 00:18:19,267
Yeah, I also said I would
get you your career back.

402
00:18:19,334 --> 00:18:21,269
But it doesn't seem
to matter

403
00:18:21,337 --> 00:18:23,505
since you've so
clearly been handed

404
00:18:23,572 --> 00:18:25,140
the golden spit bucket.

405
00:18:28,311 --> 00:18:30,312
Sympathetic overdrive.

406
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:32,949
It's a medical term.

407
00:18:33,017 --> 00:18:36,553
So is "great news."

408
00:18:36,620 --> 00:18:40,223
Of course,
if you prefer wallowing...

409
00:18:40,291 --> 00:18:42,960
All you need is a chin.

410
00:18:43,028 --> 00:18:44,829
And a heart,
apparently.

411
00:18:44,896 --> 00:18:46,230
Then you can go back

412
00:18:46,298 --> 00:18:47,531
to being the guy who won

413
00:18:47,599 --> 00:18:48,834
<i>20 of his first 20</i>
<i>instead of the guy</i>

414
00:18:48,901 --> 00:18:50,869
who lost 5 of his last 5.

415
00:18:50,937 --> 00:18:54,240
Although, technically, I count
the last one as a "no contest."

416
00:18:54,307 --> 00:18:56,175
And you save 50 bucks.
I'm a doctor.

417
00:18:56,243 --> 00:18:58,978
I don't tell a fat guy to
lay off bacon for less than 300.

418
00:19:00,681 --> 00:19:04,083
This is about dignity
for both of us.

419
00:19:04,150 --> 00:19:06,252
Give me your arm.

420
00:19:08,821 --> 00:19:13,024
Give me your arm.

421
00:19:13,092 --> 00:19:15,793
What the hell?

422
00:19:15,861 --> 00:19:16,794
Don't worry.

423
00:19:16,862 --> 00:19:18,162
It's just epinephrine.

424
00:19:18,230 --> 00:19:19,597
Ep--is it dangerous?

425
00:19:19,665 --> 00:19:20,832
In the wrong hands, very.

426
00:19:20,899 --> 00:19:23,334
So...Yeah, sort of.

427
00:19:23,402 --> 00:19:27,404
This will only take
a few seconds.

428
00:19:27,472 --> 00:19:30,808
And...you are tachycardic.

429
00:19:32,677 --> 00:19:34,611
Yo, are you psycho?

430
00:19:34,679 --> 00:19:37,080
We combine the increased
heart rate with chest trauma

431
00:19:37,148 --> 00:19:38,949
by applying a little
sweet science to the science.

432
00:19:39,017 --> 00:19:40,917
<i>Don't worry.</i>

433
00:19:40,985 --> 00:19:42,686
I'll--I'll explain more
when you wake up.

434
00:19:42,754 --> 00:19:44,588
Now, the punch that
supposedly knocked you out

435
00:19:44,655 --> 00:19:46,356
looked like it was thrown
by an old cripple.

436
00:19:46,424 --> 00:19:47,557
Kind of like this.

437
00:19:47,625 --> 00:19:49,993
Look, stop it.

438
00:19:50,061 --> 00:19:51,194
<i>Three...</i>

439
00:19:51,262 --> 00:19:54,564
Two, one.

440
00:19:56,167 --> 00:19:57,867
Huh.

441
00:19:57,935 --> 00:20:00,237
Seem to be older and more
crippled than I thought.

442
00:20:00,304 --> 00:20:02,305
Look--no.
You're embarrassing me.

443
00:20:02,373 --> 00:20:04,641
Doesn't make sense.

444
00:20:04,708 --> 00:20:06,909
Maybe if I--

445
00:20:11,315 --> 00:20:14,250
Look, get the hell out
of my life, you lunatic.

446
00:20:24,461 --> 00:20:25,561
She's in V-tach.
BP's dropping.

447
00:20:25,629 --> 00:20:26,962
Whatever you're doing
isn't working again.

448
00:20:27,030 --> 00:20:28,864
<i>There's got to be some way</i>
<i>to stop the seizures.</i>

449
00:20:28,931 --> 00:20:30,933
It's not a seizure.
She's having a heart attack.

450
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,034
<i>No pulse.</i>
That's impossible!

451
00:20:32,102 --> 00:20:33,902
<i>She runs marathons!</i>

452
00:20:37,373 --> 00:20:39,775
Charging to 200.
Clear.

453
00:20:39,842 --> 00:20:40,943
Still no pulse.

454
00:20:41,010 --> 00:20:42,277
Charging to 300.

455
00:20:42,345 --> 00:20:44,379
Why is this happening?
Clear.

456
00:20:44,447 --> 00:20:46,648
My theory is that
he's only avoiding us

457
00:20:46,716 --> 00:20:48,083
because he really
wants to avoid you.

458
00:20:48,151 --> 00:20:50,786
<i>Ma nishtanah?</i>

459
00:20:50,853 --> 00:20:53,889
You made it through med school
without ever attending a Seder?

460
00:20:53,957 --> 00:20:54,924
It means
"why is this night different

461
00:20:54,992 --> 00:20:55,958
from all other nights?"

462
00:20:56,026 --> 00:20:57,860
I'm not sure it is.

463
00:20:57,928 --> 00:21:00,130
But usually when push
comes to shove, he shows up.

464
00:21:00,197 --> 00:21:01,798
If the patient's still alive,
then push hasn't met shove yet.

465
00:21:01,865 --> 00:21:02,899
Patient is hanging
by a thread

466
00:21:02,967 --> 00:21:04,334
and we don't have
a clue why.

467
00:21:04,401 --> 00:21:07,537
Then we have to assume
he does and she isn't.

468
00:21:07,605 --> 00:21:09,906
We could or we could
assume that something

469
00:21:09,974 --> 00:21:11,274
is seriously wrong
with House

470
00:21:11,342 --> 00:21:12,809
and try to do something
about that.

471
00:21:12,877 --> 00:21:15,679
This way, even if we're wrong,
nobody dies.

472
00:21:15,746 --> 00:21:17,714
House is fine.

473
00:21:17,782 --> 00:21:20,417
House is always fine.

474
00:21:20,485 --> 00:21:22,319
I'm expanding my theory.

475
00:21:22,387 --> 00:21:24,955
He's avoiding you
<i>and</i> you're avoiding him

476
00:21:25,023 --> 00:21:26,089
and this patient
is gonna die.

477
00:21:26,157 --> 00:21:30,060
Not if you do your job.

478
00:21:45,043 --> 00:21:48,411
You're an idiot.

479
00:21:48,479 --> 00:21:49,913
How did you get in here?

480
00:21:49,981 --> 00:21:53,816
My boss has me break
into places all the time.

481
00:21:57,187 --> 00:21:59,288
Pain has been getting worse.

482
00:21:59,356 --> 00:22:02,391
I figured if I upped
the Vicodin any more,

483
00:22:02,459 --> 00:22:03,626
I'd end up back
in a rubber room,

484
00:22:03,694 --> 00:22:07,797
so this seemed
like the smarter choice.

485
00:22:07,865 --> 00:22:10,467
You're an idiot.

486
00:22:10,534 --> 00:22:12,669
You drove all the way
over here

487
00:22:12,737 --> 00:22:14,571
to break in
and call me an idiot?

488
00:22:14,639 --> 00:22:16,506
No, I drove all the way
over here to tell you

489
00:22:16,574 --> 00:22:18,541
we're implanting an automated
cardio-defibrillator,

490
00:22:18,609 --> 00:22:20,510
which won't actually do anything
to help the patient

491
00:22:20,577 --> 00:22:22,311
except maybe give us enough time
to come up with a guess

492
00:22:22,379 --> 00:22:25,348
as to what's actually
wrong with her.

493
00:22:25,416 --> 00:22:27,417
Oh, that makes more sense.

494
00:22:27,484 --> 00:22:29,552
And I broke in here
because Cuddy and Wilson

495
00:22:29,620 --> 00:22:32,722
both separately asked me to.

496
00:22:32,790 --> 00:22:35,091
Even more logical.

497
00:22:35,159 --> 00:22:37,727
And that's not heroin,

498
00:22:37,795 --> 00:22:39,863
which means you knew
I was coming over here,

499
00:22:39,931 --> 00:22:40,897
and Cuddy and Wilson
are right.

500
00:22:40,965 --> 00:22:42,298
You're just playing a game.

501
00:22:42,366 --> 00:22:45,001
Throwing out a bone
and watching us fight over it.

502
00:22:47,338 --> 00:22:49,039
There is another theory.

503
00:22:54,980 --> 00:22:58,649
Compound CS-804.

504
00:22:58,717 --> 00:23:00,051
It's an experimental drug

505
00:23:00,118 --> 00:23:03,287
that's supposed
to regrow muscle.

506
00:23:06,659 --> 00:23:09,227
This experiment
was done on rats.

507
00:23:09,295 --> 00:23:12,765
It's groundbreaking.
Huge success.

508
00:23:12,832 --> 00:23:15,768
In rats.

509
00:23:15,835 --> 00:23:19,104
Well, they got four legs.

510
00:23:19,172 --> 00:23:22,407
Think how fast
it should work on one.

511
00:23:26,713 --> 00:23:27,947
You're an idiot.

512
00:23:49,388 --> 00:23:50,354
We've got a problem.

513
00:23:50,422 --> 00:23:51,922
AICD not working?

514
00:23:51,990 --> 00:23:53,424
If it's the defibrillator,
I'd be looking elsewhere.

515
00:23:53,491 --> 00:23:54,492
Smells like bleeding.

516
00:23:54,559 --> 00:23:55,526
Rectal?

517
00:23:55,593 --> 00:23:58,462
And vaginal.

518
00:23:58,530 --> 00:24:00,797
Is it possible something got
perforated during surgery?

519
00:24:00,865 --> 00:24:02,165
Is that an accusation?

520
00:24:02,233 --> 00:24:03,500
Sounded like a question.

521
00:24:03,568 --> 00:24:05,302
<i>Just a straightforward inquiry</i>

522
00:24:05,369 --> 00:24:06,603
<i>that only someone</i>
<i>with serious insecurities</i>

523
00:24:06,670 --> 00:24:08,738
would take issue with.

524
00:24:08,806 --> 00:24:11,374
Okay, so in answering,
I have to decide

525
00:24:11,441 --> 00:24:13,243
between the only
two possibilities.

526
00:24:13,310 --> 00:24:16,346
"No" and "yes, we might have
screwed something up,

527
00:24:16,413 --> 00:24:17,781
"but are intentionally
hiding it

528
00:24:17,848 --> 00:24:19,983
because we're incompetent
and we're asses."

529
00:24:20,051 --> 00:24:21,752
Answer is "no."

530
00:24:21,820 --> 00:24:23,254
<i>Glad we didn't shortchange</i>
<i>that avenue.</i>

531
00:24:23,322 --> 00:24:24,589
It's a blood disorder.

532
00:24:24,657 --> 00:24:26,391
A coagulopathy.
That's not a diagnosis.

533
00:24:26,459 --> 00:24:28,126
That's like saying
she has a runny nose.

534
00:24:28,194 --> 00:24:29,895
True, but not saying
she has a runny nose

535
00:24:29,963 --> 00:24:31,430
risks getting snot
all over us.

536
00:24:31,498 --> 00:24:33,532
We can treat it.
Cause could still be a toxin.

537
00:24:33,599 --> 00:24:34,900
She must have been exposed
to who knows--

538
00:24:34,967 --> 00:24:36,334
Past tense, which means
she would have been better

539
00:24:36,402 --> 00:24:37,669
now that she's not.

540
00:24:37,737 --> 00:24:41,339
Same goes for House.

541
00:24:41,406 --> 00:24:42,540
If this was about Cuddy,

542
00:24:42,608 --> 00:24:43,808
he would have checked out
weeks ago.

543
00:24:43,876 --> 00:24:45,610
Something else is going on.
Something new.

544
00:24:45,677 --> 00:24:46,711
That's an awfully
simplistic approach

545
00:24:46,779 --> 00:24:48,146
to matters of the heart.

546
00:24:48,213 --> 00:24:49,280
House is rational.
He prides himself--

547
00:24:49,348 --> 00:24:50,848
no one is rational
about emotion.

548
00:24:50,916 --> 00:24:52,883
That's why they're emotions.

549
00:24:52,951 --> 00:24:54,184
What do you think?

550
00:24:54,252 --> 00:24:56,353
Me? I didn't say anything.
Exactly.

551
00:24:56,421 --> 00:24:58,322
You always have some opinion
on these things,

552
00:24:58,390 --> 00:24:59,690
especially
when it comes to House,

553
00:24:59,758 --> 00:25:01,592
double especially when
it comes to men and romance,

554
00:25:01,660 --> 00:25:03,694
but suddenly you're keeping
your mouth shut.

555
00:25:08,533 --> 00:25:10,367
House can't help us.

556
00:25:10,435 --> 00:25:12,202
<i>I respect his privacy,</i>

557
00:25:12,270 --> 00:25:13,804
no matter how stupid
and I'd appreciate it

558
00:25:13,872 --> 00:25:15,406
if you'd respect mine.

559
00:25:19,845 --> 00:25:21,846
We need to treat
the underlying condition.

560
00:25:21,914 --> 00:25:24,415
<i>Could be cancer, sepsis,</i>
<i>trauma,</i>

561
00:25:24,483 --> 00:25:26,050
liver disease,
hemorrhagic fever--

562
00:25:26,118 --> 00:25:27,385
<i>I'm gonna start treating</i>
<i>the symptoms</i>

563
00:25:27,453 --> 00:25:29,654
while you finish listing
the possible causes.

564
00:26:08,997 --> 00:26:10,698
<i>The rats are doing great.</i>

565
00:26:10,766 --> 00:26:12,366
"Great" is a little vague.

566
00:26:12,434 --> 00:26:14,502
Even better than
the previous study.

567
00:26:14,570 --> 00:26:16,771
12% increase in strength,

568
00:26:16,839 --> 00:26:19,607
22% in flexibility,
and some improvement

569
00:26:19,675 --> 00:26:21,009
in at least 60%
of the subjects.

570
00:26:21,076 --> 00:26:22,710
Have you done maximum
tolerated dose studies?

571
00:26:22,778 --> 00:26:24,045
Not yet.

572
00:26:24,112 --> 00:26:25,646
But that's part
of the beauty.

573
00:26:25,714 --> 00:26:27,882
Since the compound
is easily excreted in urine,

574
00:26:27,950 --> 00:26:29,451
as long as they keep hydrated,

575
00:26:29,518 --> 00:26:32,020
there's really no reason
to expect any danger

576
00:26:32,088 --> 00:26:34,055
at virtually any dose.

577
00:26:34,123 --> 00:26:36,325
I mean, obviously you can't
know for sure.

578
00:26:36,393 --> 00:26:38,194
But if it's worthy
of the preface "obviously,"

579
00:26:38,261 --> 00:26:41,297
then obviously it only needs
to be explained to idiots.

580
00:26:41,365 --> 00:26:42,999
Do I look like an idiot?

581
00:26:46,036 --> 00:26:48,805
Sorry.

582
00:26:48,873 --> 00:26:49,906
Cranky.

583
00:26:49,973 --> 00:26:52,108
What I meant
to say was:

584
00:26:52,175 --> 00:26:53,576
Why don't scientists
have groupies?

585
00:26:53,644 --> 00:26:56,045
'Cause I'd do you right now
if society wasn't telling me

586
00:26:56,113 --> 00:26:59,348
that you're just
an underpaid dork.

587
00:26:59,416 --> 00:27:02,418
Thank you.

588
00:27:03,686 --> 00:27:05,353
You all right?

589
00:27:05,421 --> 00:27:08,890
Leg hurts.

590
00:27:08,958 --> 00:27:11,393
Would you mind
getting me a coffee?

591
00:27:11,461 --> 00:27:14,497
How does coffee
help your leg?

592
00:27:14,565 --> 00:27:16,700
It will prevent me
from walking to get the coffee.

593
00:27:16,767 --> 00:27:19,369
Right.

594
00:27:44,629 --> 00:27:47,031
Page said she's now bleeding
from her mouth.

595
00:27:47,098 --> 00:27:48,365
You start treatment?

596
00:27:48,433 --> 00:27:49,700
I said I would.

597
00:27:49,768 --> 00:27:51,101
A "yes" would have been fine.

598
00:27:51,169 --> 00:27:54,571
Not asking the question
would have been even better.

599
00:27:54,639 --> 00:27:55,873
Any breathing issues?

600
00:27:55,940 --> 00:27:57,374
No, but--

601
00:27:57,442 --> 00:27:59,243
I'm not sure
it's internal.

602
00:27:59,311 --> 00:28:00,978
If it's coming from both ends,
it's internal.

603
00:28:01,046 --> 00:28:02,614
Her gums look like
they were burned.

604
00:29:31,900 --> 00:29:35,437
<i>Experimental drugs?</i>

605
00:29:35,504 --> 00:29:37,973
That's unfair.

606
00:29:38,041 --> 00:29:39,374
'Cause at one point,
even Vicodin

607
00:29:39,442 --> 00:29:40,909
was an experimental drug.

608
00:29:40,977 --> 00:29:42,311
I have to go.

609
00:29:42,379 --> 00:29:43,813
Well, unless you're going
to do your job,

610
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:45,581
it can wait.
I'm going to do my job.

611
00:29:45,649 --> 00:29:49,585
I'll give you a lift.

612
00:29:49,653 --> 00:29:51,187
I'll give you two minutes.

613
00:29:51,255 --> 00:29:53,990
But first, I'm gonna tell you
that I'm off the drugs

614
00:29:54,058 --> 00:29:55,491
and you'll feel silly
'cause you've got

615
00:29:55,559 --> 00:29:56,792
nothing to say
for two minutes.

616
00:29:56,860 --> 00:29:58,794
Hmm.

617
00:29:58,862 --> 00:29:59,895
Why are you off them?

618
00:29:59,963 --> 00:30:00,996
Because they don't work.

619
00:30:01,064 --> 00:30:02,397
Why were you on them?

620
00:30:02,465 --> 00:30:04,599
Because they come
in banana flavor.

621
00:30:04,667 --> 00:30:07,836
You know the answer.

622
00:30:07,903 --> 00:30:10,972
You think fixing your leg
will fix your life.

623
00:30:11,039 --> 00:30:12,573
I think that my life
will be somewhat better

624
00:30:12,641 --> 00:30:14,608
if part of my life,
specifically my leg,

625
00:30:14,676 --> 00:30:16,577
is somewhat better.

626
00:30:16,645 --> 00:30:18,479
You think all your problems
are your leg.

627
00:30:18,547 --> 00:30:19,747
And you're here to tell me
that no matter

628
00:30:19,814 --> 00:30:22,417
how depressed I may be,
it's not enough.

629
00:30:22,485 --> 00:30:24,853
I think you want everything
to be physical, tangible,

630
00:30:24,921 --> 00:30:26,788
simple.

631
00:30:26,856 --> 00:30:28,023
You want unhappiness
to have a cure.

632
00:30:28,091 --> 00:30:29,325
House, you obviously--

633
00:30:29,393 --> 00:30:31,393
I hate that word.

634
00:30:31,461 --> 00:30:33,129
I have to go now.

635
00:30:33,197 --> 00:30:34,530
Actually, I don't,

636
00:30:34,598 --> 00:30:37,099
but it would be rude to walk out
without saying anything.

637
00:30:37,167 --> 00:30:38,467
What about this?

638
00:30:38,535 --> 00:30:40,369
28-year-old woman
presenting with burn-like wounds

639
00:30:40,437 --> 00:30:41,403
in her mouth and esophagus

640
00:30:41,471 --> 00:30:43,238
<i>from a candidiasis infection.</i>

641
00:30:43,306 --> 00:30:44,740
Interesting.

642
00:30:44,807 --> 00:30:46,341
It would also be relevant
if the woman had had seizures.

643
00:30:46,409 --> 00:30:47,842
If the fungus had entered
her bloodstream--

644
00:30:47,910 --> 00:30:48,976
we would have seen it
in the blood work.

645
00:30:49,044 --> 00:30:50,077
<i>Acute myeloid leukemia</i>

646
00:30:50,145 --> 00:30:51,512
can cause swelling
in the gums.

647
00:30:51,580 --> 00:30:53,013
Again, interesting
but not relevant.

648
00:30:53,081 --> 00:30:54,915
Again, you're being an ass.

649
00:30:54,983 --> 00:30:56,316
She doesn't have a history
of blood diseases in her family,

650
00:30:56,384 --> 00:30:57,818
her blood count's normal,
and she hasn't

651
00:30:57,886 --> 00:30:59,387
been exposed
to chemical toxins.

652
00:30:59,455 --> 00:31:01,422
Not that we know of.

653
00:31:01,490 --> 00:31:03,291
Guy that she works most closely
with is also her boyfriend.

654
00:31:03,359 --> 00:31:04,793
You don't think
he would have told us

655
00:31:04,861 --> 00:31:07,162
if there had been some sort
of chemical spill or accident?

656
00:31:07,230 --> 00:31:12,135
There is one other cause
of AML.

657
00:31:12,203 --> 00:31:13,937
Wait!

658
00:31:14,005 --> 00:31:15,206
Where are you taking her?

659
00:31:15,273 --> 00:31:16,507
We need to get her
into an isolation room

660
00:31:16,575 --> 00:31:18,442
and prep for a hematopoietic
stem cell transplant.

661
00:31:18,510 --> 00:31:19,976
Isolation? Why?

662
00:31:20,044 --> 00:31:21,478
We think her blood
and immune system

663
00:31:21,546 --> 00:31:23,613
have been destroyed by an
exposure to ionizing radiation.

664
00:31:23,681 --> 00:31:24,982
But we don't work
with radiation.

665
00:31:25,049 --> 00:31:26,149
Well, apparently
your girlfriend does.

666
00:31:26,217 --> 00:31:27,918
No, she doesn't.
You're wrong.

667
00:31:27,986 --> 00:31:29,987
It must be something else.

668
00:31:30,054 --> 00:31:31,188
We found reports
that your company

669
00:31:31,256 --> 00:31:32,122
was developing tactical
nuclear warheads

670
00:31:32,190 --> 00:31:33,390
for bunker-busting bombs.

671
00:31:33,458 --> 00:31:35,291
Where? On Wikipedia?
Some paranoid idiot's blog?

672
00:31:35,359 --> 00:31:36,159
<i>I don't care where</i>
<i>you read it.</i>

673
00:31:36,227 --> 00:31:37,627
It's not true.

674
00:31:37,695 --> 00:31:39,129
You're saying there's
absolutely no chance

675
00:31:39,196 --> 00:31:40,830
that anyone in your company
is doing

676
00:31:40,898 --> 00:31:42,365
<i>any experimental research</i>
<i>that you don't know about?</i>

677
00:31:42,433 --> 00:31:45,902
No, but I know Wendy
and she wouldn't.

678
00:31:45,970 --> 00:31:46,970
Well, maybe you don't know her
as well as you thought you did.

679
00:31:47,038 --> 00:31:50,006
Excuse me.
We have to go.

680
00:32:00,418 --> 00:32:02,753
You need a drink.

681
00:32:02,821 --> 00:32:04,622
I'm fine.

682
00:32:04,689 --> 00:32:05,890
<i>That wasn't a question.</i>

683
00:32:05,957 --> 00:32:07,758
You really do need a drink.

684
00:32:12,898 --> 00:32:14,198
Found a match.

685
00:32:14,266 --> 00:32:15,566
We'll start treatment
as soon

686
00:32:15,634 --> 00:32:17,168
as we get the HSC
from the donor.

687
00:32:17,235 --> 00:32:18,636
Shouldn't be long.

688
00:32:18,703 --> 00:32:20,037
Where's Cesar?

689
00:32:20,105 --> 00:32:22,306
Uh, he's
in the waiting room.

690
00:32:22,374 --> 00:32:23,741
I want to see him.

691
00:32:23,808 --> 00:32:25,376
You can't.

692
00:32:25,443 --> 00:32:27,411
It's too dangerous with your
immune system this compromised.

693
00:32:27,479 --> 00:32:32,181
Why can't he just put on
a gown and a mask like you?

694
00:32:32,249 --> 00:32:33,383
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

695
00:32:33,450 --> 00:32:34,717
The more people
you're exposed to,

696
00:32:34,785 --> 00:32:36,386
the greater chance
of infection.

697
00:32:38,923 --> 00:32:40,924
I'm scared.

698
00:32:40,992 --> 00:32:42,859
I know.

699
00:32:42,927 --> 00:32:44,595
We're doing everything
that we can.

700
00:32:44,663 --> 00:32:47,198
<i>Cesar will be</i>
<i>with you soon.</i>

701
00:32:47,266 --> 00:32:49,401
Dr. Foreman,
you should look at this.

702
00:32:50,937 --> 00:32:52,471
What is it?

703
00:32:52,539 --> 00:32:53,706
You feeling any pain
in your pelvic region?

704
00:32:53,774 --> 00:32:56,476
No, why?

705
00:32:56,544 --> 00:32:58,144
Your genitals...
They're engorged.

706
00:33:06,587 --> 00:33:08,855
I drink any more,
I'm gonna explode.

707
00:33:08,923 --> 00:33:09,923
You're not going
to explode.

708
00:33:09,991 --> 00:33:11,291
You're just gonna
have a seizure,

709
00:33:11,359 --> 00:33:13,860
which will prove that
your kidneys are not working,

710
00:33:13,928 --> 00:33:16,663
which will also prove that they
weren't working Saturday night.

711
00:33:16,730 --> 00:33:19,432
That's why a glancing
body blow

712
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:20,934
sent your blood pressure
into the toilet

713
00:33:21,001 --> 00:33:26,172
and you onto the canvas.

714
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:28,041
How many bottles
is this supposed to take?

715
00:33:28,108 --> 00:33:29,242
Six.

716
00:33:29,310 --> 00:33:31,344
And I've drank how many?

717
00:33:31,412 --> 00:33:33,980
Eight.

718
00:33:34,047 --> 00:33:35,247
It's not an exact science.

719
00:33:35,315 --> 00:33:36,382
So in other words,

720
00:33:36,449 --> 00:33:37,783
nothing's gonna
prove you wrong.

721
00:33:37,851 --> 00:33:39,985
You're just gonna keep
making me miserable

722
00:33:40,052 --> 00:33:40,986
because you're too miserable--

723
00:33:41,053 --> 00:33:44,021
you're an idiot.

724
00:33:44,089 --> 00:33:46,891
No, you're not
gonna hit me...

725
00:33:46,959 --> 00:33:49,426
'Cause somewhere deep in that
way-too-thin skull of yours

726
00:33:49,494 --> 00:33:51,628
you know that you're
full of crap.

727
00:33:51,696 --> 00:33:53,363
That's why you stopped
jogging for me.

728
00:33:53,431 --> 00:33:55,666
That's why you drank
eight bottles.

729
00:33:55,734 --> 00:33:57,501
Because even though you want
to think that I'm wrong

730
00:33:57,569 --> 00:34:00,037
'cause it's simpler,
you also desperately want me

731
00:34:00,105 --> 00:34:01,572
to be right.

732
00:34:06,546 --> 00:34:08,581
I'm only an ass for building
your hopes up if I'm wrong.

733
00:34:11,151 --> 00:34:13,319
Last one.

734
00:34:30,803 --> 00:34:34,839
You're an ass.

735
00:34:48,623 --> 00:34:50,090
You were wrong.

736
00:34:50,158 --> 00:34:51,192
It's not the end
of the world.

737
00:34:55,064 --> 00:34:59,634
Anything else
you want to say?

738
00:34:59,702 --> 00:35:00,869
You have a problem.

739
00:35:00,937 --> 00:35:02,938
<i>I think if you</i>
<i>seriously look</i>

740
00:35:03,005 --> 00:35:06,675
at everything that--

741
00:35:06,743 --> 00:35:09,410
anything else?

742
00:35:09,478 --> 00:35:11,112
Okay, look, this isn't--

743
00:35:11,180 --> 00:35:13,213
okay! Okay!
Okay! Okay!

744
00:35:13,281 --> 00:35:16,884
No...I don't.

745
00:35:16,952 --> 00:35:18,820
Just get out of here.

746
00:35:18,888 --> 00:35:20,288
Go home.
We'll talk later.

747
00:35:20,356 --> 00:35:22,824
Someplace without
any of my stuff.

748
00:35:22,892 --> 00:35:24,326
Nothing to talk about.

749
00:35:24,393 --> 00:35:27,262
That was my point.

750
00:35:33,507 --> 00:35:34,874
<i>Inflammation of the genitals</i>

751
00:35:34,942 --> 00:35:36,142
means we were wrong.

752
00:35:36,210 --> 00:35:37,577
Thanks for the statement
of the obvious.

753
00:35:37,645 --> 00:35:38,945
You'd think so,
wouldn't you?

754
00:35:39,013 --> 00:35:40,747
Foreman wants to keep shooting
for radiation poisoning.

755
00:35:40,815 --> 00:35:41,815
<i>Because the seizure's</i>
<i>have stopped.</i>

756
00:35:41,883 --> 00:35:43,150
Because her fever's gone away.

757
00:35:43,218 --> 00:35:44,852
- Because she's improved.
- By luck.

758
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:46,587
I don't think
the patient cares.

759
00:35:46,655 --> 00:35:48,523
Yes, she's gonna die
in considerably less discomfort

760
00:35:48,591 --> 00:35:49,725
thanks to you treating
a few of the symptoms

761
00:35:49,792 --> 00:35:51,427
instead of the disease.

762
00:35:51,494 --> 00:35:54,329
I paged Ho--
Shut up.

763
00:35:54,397 --> 00:35:55,664
You're drunk.

764
00:35:55,732 --> 00:35:58,334
Well, whose fault is that?

765
00:35:58,401 --> 00:36:00,102
Give me another scotch.

766
00:36:00,170 --> 00:36:03,805
I can't serve you.

767
00:36:03,873 --> 00:36:05,441
This 'cause I'm black?

768
00:36:05,508 --> 00:36:07,409
'Cause I'm not, so...

769
00:36:07,477 --> 00:36:09,778
Come on, buddy.

770
00:36:09,846 --> 00:36:10,812
Look, you can't get me drunk
and then give me crap

771
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:12,080
for being drunk.

772
00:36:12,148 --> 00:36:14,216
<i>That's like</i>
<i>dumping someone</i>

773
00:36:14,283 --> 00:36:15,517
and then giving them crap
for being upset.

774
00:36:15,585 --> 00:36:16,618
That's just not decent.

775
00:36:20,989 --> 00:36:23,324
Let me explain
why people come here.

776
00:36:23,391 --> 00:36:26,160
They come here to drink.

777
00:36:26,227 --> 00:36:28,762
Which causes us to ask,
why do people drink?

778
00:36:28,830 --> 00:36:31,198
Hmm?
Is it sustenance?

779
00:36:33,167 --> 00:36:35,135
No.
Is it taste?

780
00:36:37,873 --> 00:36:39,073
No.
Don't be a jerk.

781
00:36:39,141 --> 00:36:42,243
Is it the company
of stout-hearted men?

782
00:36:42,310 --> 00:36:43,578
I don't think so.

783
00:36:43,645 --> 00:36:46,981
Is it killing pain?

784
00:36:47,049 --> 00:36:48,650
Yes.

785
00:36:48,718 --> 00:36:52,354
7 1/2% life duller.

786
00:36:52,422 --> 00:36:53,889
That's the business you're in.

787
00:36:53,957 --> 00:36:56,192
You're in the "screw the world"
business.

788
00:36:56,259 --> 00:36:59,495
You're in the
"reality sucks

789
00:36:59,563 --> 00:37:02,331
and fantasy temporarily appears
to not suck" business.

790
00:37:02,399 --> 00:37:05,068
Just get the moron a drink
so he'll shut the hell up.

791
00:37:07,772 --> 00:37:10,241
No.

792
00:37:10,308 --> 00:37:13,377
I'm giving you your drink.
Have you no pride?

793
00:37:13,445 --> 00:37:17,381
Either serving me is a good idea
or it's a bad idea.

794
00:37:17,449 --> 00:37:18,782
Shutting me up
is a crappy reason

795
00:37:18,850 --> 00:37:21,585
for compromising
what you believe.

796
00:37:21,653 --> 00:37:22,453
Not even an effective one
apparently.

797
00:37:30,696 --> 00:37:32,731
Am I gonna have to hit him?

798
00:37:32,798 --> 00:37:35,601
Not a good idea.

799
00:37:35,668 --> 00:37:37,870
But what if it's
the right thing to do?

800
00:37:37,937 --> 00:37:42,908
Compromise is never
the answer.

801
00:37:42,976 --> 00:37:44,910
Stand up.

802
00:37:48,248 --> 00:37:51,683
I will allow you
to throw the first punch.

803
00:37:51,751 --> 00:37:52,684
Sit down.

804
00:37:52,752 --> 00:37:54,286
I'm not gonna hit you.

805
00:37:54,354 --> 00:37:56,455
Just as well,
'cause I was lying.

806
00:38:12,239 --> 00:38:14,273
<i>You can relax.</i>

807
00:38:14,341 --> 00:38:16,008
She's getting better?

808
00:38:16,076 --> 00:38:18,745
Bad news is, because
of your extended exposure to her

809
00:38:18,812 --> 00:38:20,146
and her workplace,
we're gonna need

810
00:38:20,214 --> 00:38:21,114
to treat you as well.

811
00:38:21,181 --> 00:38:22,815
I feel fine.

812
00:38:22,883 --> 00:38:24,684
Unfortunately that's the way
it can be with radiation.

813
00:38:24,752 --> 00:38:26,819
<i>No symptoms until it's too late</i>
<i>to do anything.</i>

814
00:38:26,887 --> 00:38:28,121
You're gonna need
a bone marrow transplant.

815
00:38:28,189 --> 00:38:30,457
No.

816
00:38:30,524 --> 00:38:31,725
<i>A marrow transplant does</i>
<i>leave you exposed</i>

817
00:38:31,792 --> 00:38:32,792
<i>to all sorts</i>
<i>of illnesses,</i>

818
00:38:32,860 --> 00:38:34,161
but there really is
no choice here.

819
00:38:34,228 --> 00:38:35,829
She doesn't have
radiation poisoning.

820
00:38:35,897 --> 00:38:36,863
She's getting better.

821
00:38:36,931 --> 00:38:37,798
We need to start
your treatment

822
00:38:37,865 --> 00:38:38,799
before it's too late.

823
00:38:38,867 --> 00:38:41,101
No.

824
00:38:44,306 --> 00:38:45,772
<i>You're either suicidal</i>

825
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:49,910
or you know we're wrong.

826
00:38:49,978 --> 00:38:51,311
And the only way you could
know for sure

827
00:38:51,379 --> 00:38:53,346
what wasn't killing her is
if you knew what was.

828
00:38:53,414 --> 00:38:56,048
And you do,
don't you?

829
00:38:56,116 --> 00:38:57,683
Because you've been
poisoning her

830
00:38:57,751 --> 00:38:59,017
and the reason
she's getting better

831
00:38:59,085 --> 00:39:00,586
is because you haven't
been near her.

832
00:39:00,653 --> 00:39:02,254
<i>Our co-workers are</i>
<i>on their way</i>

833
00:39:02,322 --> 00:39:04,589
to your home right now
to search for poisons.

834
00:39:04,657 --> 00:39:06,524
You mind saving them
the trouble?

835
00:39:06,592 --> 00:39:08,359
Attempted murder
is better than murder.

836
00:39:54,205 --> 00:39:57,106
<i>What are you doing here?</i>

837
00:39:57,174 --> 00:39:58,708
Training for my big fight.

838
00:39:58,776 --> 00:39:59,809
<i>Just need you to--</i>

839
00:39:59,876 --> 00:40:01,143
drink five more bottles?

840
00:40:01,211 --> 00:40:03,579
<i>Get punched a few more times?</i>

841
00:40:03,646 --> 00:40:05,447
Look, just get out
and give up.

842
00:40:05,514 --> 00:40:06,481
That's your specialty.

843
00:40:09,151 --> 00:40:11,586
Ooh, looks like you already
lost your big fight.

844
00:40:14,723 --> 00:40:15,757
<i>Look, I may not be able</i>
<i>to take a punch,</i>

845
00:40:15,824 --> 00:40:17,225
but I can still throw one.

846
00:40:17,293 --> 00:40:19,695
Three, two...

847
00:40:24,568 --> 00:40:28,205
What a lovely day.

848
00:40:35,380 --> 00:40:38,381
Where's Cesar?

849
00:40:38,449 --> 00:40:41,451
Um...In jail.

850
00:40:44,188 --> 00:40:47,323
He was trying to kill you.

851
00:40:47,390 --> 00:40:50,092
He found out
about you and Glenn,

852
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:51,760
which, he admitted,
shouldn't have surprised him

853
00:40:51,828 --> 00:40:55,063
since he started seeing you
while you were dating Tony.

854
00:40:55,131 --> 00:40:58,133
He poisoned me?

855
00:40:58,201 --> 00:41:01,637
Repeatedly...
With Spanish fly.

856
00:41:01,705 --> 00:41:03,906
The active ingredient
cantharidin is a potent toxin

857
00:41:03,974 --> 00:41:06,909
and can cause a lot
of the same damage as radiation.

858
00:41:10,380 --> 00:41:12,381
He poisoned me?

859
00:41:15,284 --> 00:41:18,220
I'm sorry.

860
00:41:18,287 --> 00:41:23,558
He had a security clearance.

861
00:41:26,462 --> 00:41:27,395
Ahem!

862
00:41:27,463 --> 00:41:29,730
<i>What's this?</i>

863
00:41:29,798 --> 00:41:32,599
A palm.

864
00:41:32,667 --> 00:41:35,469
Hmm, useful for
many things.

865
00:41:35,537 --> 00:41:39,808
Slapping, greasing, probably
some other applications too.

866
00:41:39,876 --> 00:41:43,012
Right now it's ready
for $50 and humiliation.

867
00:41:43,079 --> 00:41:45,682
He was actually sick?

868
00:41:45,750 --> 00:41:47,117
He wasn't knocked out
by the punch.

869
00:41:47,184 --> 00:41:49,119
He was knocked out by
the clinch before the punch.

870
00:41:49,187 --> 00:41:51,589
<i>Took a shot to the back</i>
<i>of the neck.</i>

871
00:41:51,656 --> 00:41:53,424
More specifically,
to an abnormal growth of nerves

872
00:41:53,492 --> 00:41:55,760
caused by a glomus tumor.

873
00:41:55,828 --> 00:41:57,429
Kind of like a built-in taser.

874
00:41:57,496 --> 00:41:59,164
Sent a massive shock
to his entire body,

875
00:41:59,232 --> 00:42:00,699
shut everything down.

876
00:42:00,767 --> 00:42:03,402
Wow.
Fascinating.

877
00:42:03,469 --> 00:42:06,671
Completely explains exactly
how he lost.

878
00:42:06,739 --> 00:42:08,073
Oh, you are not gonna
be like that,

879
00:42:08,141 --> 00:42:10,308
'cause you got
a lot more posters here.

880
00:42:10,376 --> 00:42:12,410
No, I'm not.

881

Well done, House.

00:42:13,946 --> 00:42:15,413
You might have saved
that guy.

883

Given him his life back.

00:42:16,883 --> 00:42:18,817
Oh, no.
He needs surgery.

885
00:42:18,885 --> 00:42:22,022
He's never gonna fight again.

886
00:42:22,089 --> 00:42:24,624

00:42:24,692 --> 00:42:25,625
You okay?

888
00:42:25,693 --> 00:42:27,861
