1
00:00:14,214 --> 00:00:16,115
Book you for 9:00?

2
00:00:16,183 --> 00:00:17,250
Yeah.
Uh-huh.

3
00:00:17,317 --> 00:00:18,951
Take the day off.

4
00:00:19,019 --> 00:00:20,586
Thank you.

5
00:00:20,654 --> 00:00:21,553
All right.

8
00:02:42,748 --> 00:02:46,384
So what did you do?

9
00:02:46,452 --> 00:02:47,386
You figured out I was in jail,

10
00:02:47,387 --> 00:02:48,854
but you don't know why?

11
00:02:48,921 --> 00:02:51,690
<i>I've been busy.</i>

12
00:02:51,758 --> 00:02:53,091
Excessive prescribing.

13
00:02:53,159 --> 00:02:54,960
Not that busy.

14
00:02:55,028 --> 00:02:57,863
<i>I know that you pled down</i>
<i>to excessive prescribing,</i>

15
00:02:57,931 --> 00:03:00,933
but the question was
"what did you do?"

16
00:03:04,738 --> 00:03:08,041
36-year-old, non-smoking
junior high science teacher

17
00:03:08,109 --> 00:03:09,944
started coughing blood
in the middle of homeroom.

18
00:03:12,114 --> 00:03:12,914
<i>House says he's gonna be out</i>

19
00:03:12,982 --> 00:03:14,716
for the next three days.

20
00:03:14,784 --> 00:03:16,084
<i>Sweet. If I go straight to the airport,</i>

21
00:03:16,152 --> 00:03:17,753
<i>I can make Cabo</i>
<i>for the last call.</i>

22
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:20,121
Um, he also said to call him
if we find a case.

23
00:03:20,189 --> 00:03:21,623
Which we didn't.
<i>What do you call this?</i>

24
00:03:21,691 --> 00:03:22,857
<i>Could be a case. Could be nothing.</i>

25
00:03:22,925 --> 00:03:25,493
Sadly, we'll just never know.

26
00:03:25,561 --> 00:03:26,627
<i>He's coughing blood.</i>

27
00:03:26,695 --> 00:03:27,761
A lot of people are.

28
00:03:27,829 --> 00:03:29,096
Right now I have
to get to Vernon

29
00:03:29,163 --> 00:03:30,664
while there's still enough
powder to ski on.

30
00:03:30,731 --> 00:03:32,832
This is where a lesser man

31
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:34,100
would make
a black-guy-skiing joke.

32
00:03:34,168 --> 00:03:38,070
You owe me a body shot.

33
00:03:38,138 --> 00:03:40,473
Make it fast.
I'm driving.

34
00:03:40,541 --> 00:03:44,910
I don't want to end up
in jail like...

35
00:03:44,978 --> 00:03:48,281
A person should who used their
phone illegally while driving.

36
00:03:48,348 --> 00:03:50,717
36-year-old male with hemoptysis,

37
00:03:50,785 --> 00:03:51,918
headaches, chills,
and chest pain.

38
00:03:51,986 --> 00:03:53,620
Where are you?

39
00:03:53,688 --> 00:03:55,155
On my way to the greater
Schenectady chili cook-off

40
00:03:55,223 --> 00:03:56,290
and spud gun competition.

41
00:03:56,358 --> 00:03:59,127
That's your honeymoon?

42
00:03:59,195 --> 00:04:01,095
Nope, Dominika went to A.C.
with her boyfriend.

43
00:04:01,163 --> 00:04:02,964
E.R. ruled out bronchitis,

44
00:04:03,031 --> 00:04:04,065
pneumonia, and lung cancer.

45
00:04:04,132 --> 00:04:06,467
So diagnosis...boring.
It's epistaxis.

46
00:04:06,534 --> 00:04:07,601
<i>It's a nosebleed.</i>

47
00:04:07,669 --> 00:04:09,136
<i>Blood runs into his lungs,</i>

48
00:04:09,204 --> 00:04:10,237
he coughs it back up,

49
00:04:10,305 --> 00:04:11,338
flu explains the rest
of the symptoms.

50
00:04:11,406 --> 00:04:13,273
Going once, going twice...

51
00:04:13,341 --> 00:04:15,509
Toxic exposure
to ammonia or sulfites

52
00:04:15,577 --> 00:04:17,144
can traumatize the lungs,

53
00:04:17,211 --> 00:04:19,279
cause neuralgias or fevers.

54
00:04:19,347 --> 00:04:20,781
<i>Fits better because</i>
<i>of his radiating chest pain.</i>

55
00:04:20,849 --> 00:04:24,017
Sold. To Masters.

56
00:04:24,085 --> 00:04:25,185
Do a home search for toxins.

57
00:04:25,253 --> 00:04:30,058
Draw cultures
for bacteria and fungi.

58
00:04:30,125 --> 00:04:31,626
You're married?

59
00:04:31,694 --> 00:04:34,863
You were gone so long.

60
00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:38,700
Green card.

61
00:04:38,768 --> 00:04:40,001
Thanks for not saying anything.

62
00:04:40,069 --> 00:04:41,002
I just need some time to...

63
00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:42,838
I didn't do it for you.

64
00:04:42,905 --> 00:04:47,241
Some puzzles are just
too good to share.

65
00:04:47,309 --> 00:04:48,543
This is my exit.

66
00:04:55,951 --> 00:04:57,117
Chili?

67
00:04:57,185 --> 00:04:59,954
I hate chili.
Love spud guns.

68
00:05:04,259 --> 00:05:06,260
You get nosebleeds?

69
00:05:06,328 --> 00:05:07,794
Yeah, yeah.

70
00:05:07,862 --> 00:05:09,029
You think that's where
the blood came from?

71
00:05:09,097 --> 00:05:11,665
I don't just think it.
I hope it.

72
00:05:11,732 --> 00:05:12,966
When was the last time
it happened?

73
00:05:13,034 --> 00:05:14,134
At the quarterfinals.

74
00:05:14,202 --> 00:05:16,469
I coach volleyball,
and during warm-ups

75
00:05:16,537 --> 00:05:19,806
I got hit in the nose
a few months ago.

76
00:05:21,976 --> 00:05:23,910
You coach volleyball in a gym?

77
00:05:23,978 --> 00:05:25,245
Yes.

78
00:05:25,312 --> 00:05:26,746
With showers?
<i>Yes.</i>

79
00:05:26,814 --> 00:05:28,882
Clean showers?
<i>Not particularly.</i>

80
00:05:28,949 --> 00:05:30,417
The blood you were
coughing up wasn't blood.

81
00:05:30,485 --> 00:05:33,520
<i>Dirty gym washroom means</i>
<i>serratia infection.</i>

82
00:05:33,588 --> 00:05:34,855
Your lungs are full
of red bacteria.

83
00:05:34,923 --> 00:05:37,958
You were right.
That was an interesting case.

84
00:05:38,026 --> 00:05:39,426
<i>You start him on Levaquin.</i>

85
00:05:39,494 --> 00:05:41,728
I'll start looking
for my good flip-flops.

86
00:05:49,870 --> 00:05:52,205
Think that might be blood.

87
00:05:54,776 --> 00:05:56,810
What's this really all about, House?

88
00:05:56,878 --> 00:05:59,046
As convincing as I find
your deep devotion

89
00:05:59,113 --> 00:06:00,180
to vegetable trajectory.

90
00:06:00,248 --> 00:06:01,681
First of all, it's a tuber.

91
00:06:01,749 --> 00:06:04,618
And you're just jealous because
your potato-related plans

92
00:06:04,686 --> 00:06:08,322
are more of the serving
up fries variety.

93
00:06:08,390 --> 00:06:11,258
You did time.

94
00:06:11,326 --> 00:06:12,893
Means your license
is suspended.

95
00:06:12,961 --> 00:06:14,528
Which means your
leave of absence

96
00:06:14,596 --> 00:06:16,931
is definitely indefinite.

97
00:06:16,998 --> 00:06:21,969
What exactly
are you going back to?

98
00:06:22,037 --> 00:06:24,138
I'd only have to serve up fries

99
00:06:24,206 --> 00:06:25,639
until
the medical board hearing.

100
00:06:25,707 --> 00:06:27,841
I stand corrected.

101
00:06:27,909 --> 00:06:30,778
You obviously have a rich,
full life waiting for you.

102
00:06:30,845 --> 00:06:33,914
I'll slow down the car
and you can roll out.

103
00:06:33,982 --> 00:06:37,317
I don't even have
a change of clothes.

104
00:06:37,385 --> 00:06:41,588
Damn. If only
I'd planned for that.

105
00:06:50,999 --> 00:06:53,133
Okay, here's what I got.

106
00:06:53,201 --> 00:06:55,435
One, you were in jail
for six months,

107
00:06:55,503 --> 00:06:57,137
but you were gone about a year,

108
00:06:57,205 --> 00:06:58,038
which means that when you left

109
00:06:58,106 --> 00:06:59,340
you hadn't been arrested.

110
00:06:59,407 --> 00:07:02,176
Two, you enjoy being known
as a number.

111
00:07:02,243 --> 00:07:04,444
You don't want people
to know the real you,

112
00:07:04,512 --> 00:07:06,279
because you think
the real you is weak.

113
00:07:06,347 --> 00:07:10,850
You were running...

114
00:07:10,917 --> 00:07:13,352
A bleeding-heart medical
consulting business

115
00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:17,489
for illegals, or some other
sympathetic under-class.

116
00:07:17,557 --> 00:07:18,490
No.

117
00:07:18,558 --> 00:07:20,259
Over-class?

118
00:07:20,327 --> 00:07:21,527
This interrogation thing
is getting annoying.

119
00:07:21,595 --> 00:07:23,529
Studies have shown
that un-annoying interrogation

120
00:07:23,597 --> 00:07:25,031
is 50% less effective.

121
00:07:25,099 --> 00:07:27,500
Why are you so determined
to bring me to this competition?

122
00:07:27,568 --> 00:07:28,569
Why don't you bring Wilson?

123
00:07:28,636 --> 00:07:30,304
Wilson thinks it's stupid.

124
00:07:30,372 --> 00:07:33,274
<i>I</i> think it's stupid.

125
00:07:33,342 --> 00:07:35,543
Junior year of high school,

126
00:07:35,611 --> 00:07:38,346
you placed fourth
in a West Virginia

127
00:07:38,414 --> 00:07:40,081
all-county science fair.

128
00:07:40,149 --> 00:07:43,718
Your project, clean combustion.

129
00:07:43,786 --> 00:07:45,453
<i>Yeah, I also</i>
<i>wore a training bra.</i>

130
00:07:45,521 --> 00:07:46,488
<i>Things have changed.</i>

131
00:07:46,555 --> 00:07:48,756
Not that much.

132
00:07:48,824 --> 00:07:51,592
I've been going to this contest
for four years.

133
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:53,861
For four years I've come second

134
00:07:53,929 --> 00:07:58,465
to a pissant named Harold Lam.

135
00:08:00,468 --> 00:08:02,402
This is serious?

136
00:08:03,538 --> 00:08:04,772
Second.

137
00:08:08,576 --> 00:08:10,243
Okay.

138
00:08:10,311 --> 00:08:11,311
I can help you,

139
00:08:11,379 --> 00:08:12,646
<i>but I'm going to need</i>

140
00:08:12,713 --> 00:08:13,980
<i>to make a personal stop</i>
<i>along the way.</i>

141
00:08:14,048 --> 00:08:14,982
What kind of stop?

142
00:08:15,049 --> 00:08:16,550
Personal.

143
00:08:16,617 --> 00:08:20,387
Did I not mention that?

144
00:08:20,454 --> 00:08:21,588
You gonna tell me
where you were last night?

145
00:08:21,656 --> 00:08:23,490
I ran into a friend.

146
00:08:23,558 --> 00:08:25,659
We had 50 bucks on the Bulls.

147
00:08:25,726 --> 00:08:26,726
<i>I had to eat a large pizza</i>
<i>by myself.</i>

148
00:08:26,794 --> 00:08:28,728
You missed me.

149
00:08:28,796 --> 00:08:30,730
Not as much as I miss my $50.

150
00:08:35,702 --> 00:08:36,636
Where'd you meet her?

151
00:08:36,703 --> 00:08:38,237
At the hospital.

152
00:08:38,305 --> 00:08:39,572
If it's Masters,
just lie to me.

153
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:41,941
Oh.
It's the new CNA

154
00:08:42,009 --> 00:08:43,477
<i>on the third floor.</i>

155
00:08:43,544 --> 00:08:45,646
The redhead.
She's hot.

156
00:08:45,713 --> 00:08:47,681
And I'm seeing her again
tomorrow night.

157
00:08:47,749 --> 00:08:49,750
I don't know how you do it.

158
00:08:49,818 --> 00:08:51,886
Is it the cute, harmless vibe,

159
00:08:51,953 --> 00:08:54,489
the self-deprecating humor,
or just straight-up roofies?

160
00:08:54,557 --> 00:08:56,257
If you're interested,

161
00:08:56,325 --> 00:08:57,726
I do seminars.

162
00:09:17,772 --> 00:09:19,973
No electric, no gas either.

163
00:09:20,012 --> 00:09:21,346
It's cold in here.

164
00:09:21,414 --> 00:09:23,148
The good thing is I found a guy

165
00:09:23,216 --> 00:09:24,617
who makes you look
like a good roommate.

166
00:09:26,219 --> 00:09:27,953
Maybe hoarding's a symptom.

167
00:09:28,021 --> 00:09:29,621
<i>Could be caused by brain injury</i>

168
00:09:29,689 --> 00:09:32,557
<i>or early-onset Alzheimer's.</i>

169
00:09:32,625 --> 00:09:33,691
<i>It's most likely that it's psychological.</i>

170
00:09:33,759 --> 00:09:35,693
As to what's making him
cough blood,

171
00:09:35,761 --> 00:09:37,228
dealer's choice.

172
00:09:37,296 --> 00:09:38,763
<i>Declutter your home.</i>

173
00:09:38,831 --> 00:09:40,631
The hoarder's handbook.

174
00:09:40,699 --> 00:09:41,866
<i>He's hoarding books</i>
<i>on hoarding.</i>

175
00:09:41,933 --> 00:09:45,436
Ugh.

176
00:09:45,503 --> 00:09:46,637
He doesn't have running water.

177
00:09:46,705 --> 00:09:48,906
How does this guy live,

178
00:09:48,973 --> 00:09:51,041
let alone make it to work every
day and teach a bunch of kids?

179
00:09:51,109 --> 00:09:54,345
Fridge is on. He's hooked it up
to a neighbor or something.

180
00:09:57,083 --> 00:09:58,550
Cat.

181
00:10:02,789 --> 00:10:04,523
I might have to throw up.

182
00:10:04,591 --> 00:10:06,525
He'll want to keep that too.

183
00:10:11,131 --> 00:10:13,133
Aspergillosis.

184
00:10:13,201 --> 00:10:14,901
Explains the coughing blood,

185
00:10:14,969 --> 00:10:17,137
and if he's formed
small aspergillomas,

186
00:10:17,205 --> 00:10:18,172
it could explain the headache
and chest pain.

187
00:10:18,239 --> 00:10:20,541
I'll be in the car.

188
00:10:24,446 --> 00:10:29,783
Okay, turn right.

189
00:10:29,851 --> 00:10:31,318
You were writing
bogus prescriptions

190
00:10:31,386 --> 00:10:34,154
for medical marijuana.

191
00:10:34,222 --> 00:10:37,857
Please say no
because you have to be an idiot

192
00:10:37,925 --> 00:10:38,959
to actually screw that up.

193
00:10:39,027 --> 00:10:41,094
No.

194
00:10:41,162 --> 00:10:43,430
I mean, I was,
but I didn't get caught.

195
00:10:43,498 --> 00:10:47,134
I have to admit, you have
one of the best game faces

196
00:10:47,201 --> 00:10:49,702
I've ever seen.

197
00:10:49,770 --> 00:10:51,538
Also one
of the best game bodies.

198
00:10:51,606 --> 00:10:53,807
Pull over.

199
00:10:55,843 --> 00:10:58,611
Hang on a second.

200
00:11:43,027 --> 00:11:44,895
Didn't know you were
a Jehovah's Witness.

201
00:11:44,962 --> 00:11:47,297
Yeah, the weak lost faith
when Christ didn't return

202
00:11:47,365 --> 00:11:52,636
in '75, but I still believe.

203
00:11:52,704 --> 00:11:55,505
You're really not gonna tell me
what just happened?

204
00:11:55,573 --> 00:11:59,709
I don't know about you,
but I am starving.

205
00:12:12,689 --> 00:12:14,290
You broke into my home?

206
00:12:14,358 --> 00:12:17,827
We slowly pushed
into your home.

207
00:12:17,895 --> 00:12:20,063
So what did you find?

208
00:12:20,131 --> 00:12:21,632
A compost heap in your fridge.

209
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:23,901
We think
you have aspergillosis.

210
00:12:23,969 --> 00:12:25,703
It's treatable
with antifungals.

211
00:12:25,771 --> 00:12:27,538
You do remarkably well
for living...

212
00:12:27,606 --> 00:12:29,540
Like you live.

213
00:12:29,608 --> 00:12:32,209
I use bottled water
and flashlights.

214
00:12:32,277 --> 00:12:33,977
It's like camping.

215
00:12:34,044 --> 00:12:36,880
Fun.

216
00:12:36,947 --> 00:12:38,014
We're also gonna need
a psych consult.

217
00:12:38,082 --> 00:12:39,649
I'm not a hoarder.

218
00:12:39,717 --> 00:12:44,187
I'm just a major slob.

219
00:12:44,254 --> 00:12:46,789
You save earwax.

220
00:12:51,863 --> 00:12:54,465
You know,
I'm actually kind of hurt

221
00:12:54,533 --> 00:12:55,866
that you don't know what I did.

222
00:12:55,934 --> 00:12:58,036
I'm not worth bribing
a court official

223
00:12:58,103 --> 00:13:00,005
or hacking into police records?

224
00:13:00,073 --> 00:13:01,506
Where's the fun in that?

225
00:13:01,574 --> 00:13:05,911
You could have at least hired
Cuddy's weird boyfriend.

226
00:13:05,979 --> 00:13:08,514
Lucas?
Mm-hmm.

227
00:13:08,582 --> 00:13:10,382
You don't know?

228
00:13:10,450 --> 00:13:12,985
What, is he dead or something?

229
00:13:13,053 --> 00:13:14,686
No.

230
00:13:16,823 --> 00:13:19,057
Actually, until
a couple of weeks ago,

231
00:13:19,125 --> 00:13:21,159
I was Cuddy's weird boyfriend.

232
00:13:22,628 --> 00:13:25,429
You're gonna have to do
a lot better than that.

233
00:13:35,508 --> 00:13:40,113
Are...are you okay?

234
00:13:40,181 --> 00:13:43,350
Yeah, I'm fine.

235
00:13:43,418 --> 00:13:47,655
It's not a big deal.

236
00:13:54,530 --> 00:13:57,464
I killed a man.

237
00:14:12,046 --> 00:14:13,613
Psych eval gave us nothing.

238
00:14:13,684 --> 00:14:14,918
So our patient
is just an average Joe

239
00:14:14,985 --> 00:14:17,187
with a two-foot pile
of used q-tips?

240
00:14:17,255 --> 00:14:18,755
Whatever he is,
he doesn't have aspergillosis.

241
00:14:18,823 --> 00:14:21,024
Pain's intensified,
and now he needs oxygen.

242
00:14:21,092 --> 00:14:22,692
There's got to be all kinds
of toxins in that place.

243
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:24,227
Exposure issues
don't make sense.

244
00:14:24,295 --> 00:14:25,362
He's been here a full day.
He'd be getting better,

245
00:14:25,429 --> 00:14:26,730
not worse.

246
00:14:26,798 --> 00:14:29,699
Unless exposure was keeping him
from getting worse.

247
00:14:29,767 --> 00:14:31,034
<i>The gas was off</i> <i>at his place.</i>

248
00:14:31,102 --> 00:14:32,302
<i>How does he stay warm?</i>
Portable heater?

249
00:14:32,370 --> 00:14:33,938
Or portable gas heater,

250
00:14:34,005 --> 00:14:35,539
which emits carbon monoxide.

251
00:14:35,607 --> 00:14:37,042
Which is a vasodilator.

252
00:14:37,109 --> 00:14:39,477
The low-grade exposure
was actually improving

253
00:14:39,545 --> 00:14:40,712
<i>his lung capacity.</i>

254
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:41,847
<i>We bring him here,</i>
<i>he gets worse.</i>

255
00:14:41,915 --> 00:14:42,948
If we're right,
don't need House,

256
00:14:43,016 --> 00:14:44,183
and we still get two days off.

257
00:14:44,251 --> 00:14:45,017
<i>We still have to prove it.</i>

258
00:14:45,085 --> 00:14:46,319
Someone's got to go back

259
00:14:46,386 --> 00:14:49,388
into that place
and test for C.O.

260
00:14:49,455 --> 00:14:50,889
Chase and I can go.

261
00:14:52,725 --> 00:14:54,092
It's only fair.

262
00:14:54,159 --> 00:14:56,660
Fairness is important.

263
00:15:03,535 --> 00:15:06,536
<i>You're awfully quiet.</i>

264
00:15:06,604 --> 00:15:07,837
Sorry.
That's just how I get

265
00:15:07,905 --> 00:15:09,506
around people
who have recently killed a man.

266
00:15:09,573 --> 00:15:12,775
It wasn't...

267
00:15:12,843 --> 00:15:14,344
You know, I've had
a pretty rough year.

268
00:15:14,411 --> 00:15:15,779
Do you think maybe we could just
give this whole thing a rest?

269
00:15:15,847 --> 00:15:19,682
You killed a man.

270
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:21,952
But you pled out to drugs.

271
00:15:22,019 --> 00:15:24,754
<i>Hit-and-run</i>
<i>under the influence.</i>

272
00:15:24,821 --> 00:15:27,257
Guy you kneed in the groin
was your date

273
00:15:27,324 --> 00:15:28,558
who dropped a dime on you.

274
00:15:28,626 --> 00:15:30,293
I'm asking you to let it go.

275
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:31,628
And I really wish
I was the kind of person

276
00:15:31,695 --> 00:15:32,862
who could do that.

277
00:15:43,674 --> 00:15:45,074
Ruby, right?

278
00:15:45,142 --> 00:15:47,343
Yeah.

279
00:15:47,411 --> 00:15:48,778
Hey, how are you liking PPTH?

280
00:15:48,846 --> 00:15:50,647
It's great.
Everyone's so friendly.

281
00:15:50,715 --> 00:15:52,983
Yeah.
Especially Dr. Taub.

282
00:15:53,050 --> 00:15:55,018
<i>Don't worry.</i>

283
00:15:55,086 --> 00:15:56,754
I'm not gonna bust your chops.

284
00:15:56,821 --> 00:15:58,889
<i>I just want to know one thing.</i>

285
00:15:58,957 --> 00:16:00,958
How did he get you
to go out with him?

286
00:16:01,026 --> 00:16:03,494
Why?
Is...is there something...

287
00:16:03,562 --> 00:16:05,229
No, no, no, no,
he's...he's great.

288
00:16:05,297 --> 00:16:06,730
I'm...you know,
I'm just asking

289
00:16:06,798 --> 00:16:08,866
because...

290
00:16:10,535 --> 00:16:13,605
Well, he's...

291
00:16:15,641 --> 00:16:16,942
Um...

292
00:16:17,009 --> 00:16:18,410
You know what, never mind.

293
00:16:18,477 --> 00:16:19,744
It's none of my business.

294
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:21,079
You guys have fun tonight.

295
00:16:21,146 --> 00:16:22,246
I'm not seeing him tonight.

296
00:16:22,314 --> 00:16:24,215
We had plans, but he canceled.

297
00:16:24,282 --> 00:16:27,618
Dr. Stern to Radiology.
Dr. Stern to Radiology.

298
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:45,704
<i>This thing's got no fuel valve.</i>

299
00:16:45,772 --> 00:16:48,006
<i>Means you can't regulate</i>
<i>the input.</i>

300
00:16:48,074 --> 00:16:50,909
And what is this?
A barbecue lighter?

301
00:16:55,848 --> 00:16:58,717
Your gun sucks.

302
00:17:07,059 --> 00:17:10,529
We should treat this
like an archaeological dig.

303
00:17:10,596 --> 00:17:12,931
Grid the site, excavate,

304
00:17:12,999 --> 00:17:14,099
catalog, analyze.

305
00:17:15,268 --> 00:17:16,402
You like it here.

306
00:17:16,469 --> 00:17:18,470
You don't think
this is fascinating?

307
00:17:18,538 --> 00:17:20,840
Not nearly as fascinating
as the fact

308
00:17:20,908 --> 00:17:23,176
that you think
it's fascinating.

309
00:17:23,243 --> 00:17:24,143
But this guy kept everything

310
00:17:24,211 --> 00:17:25,979
he ever came into contact with.

311
00:17:26,046 --> 00:17:28,047
An interactive life history.

312
00:17:28,115 --> 00:17:31,317
It's an indiscriminate pile
of rubbish.

313
00:17:31,385 --> 00:17:33,853
Well, for the most part,

314
00:17:33,921 --> 00:17:35,721
so are our lives.

315
00:17:38,358 --> 00:17:40,026
There's no carbon monoxide.

316
00:17:40,093 --> 00:17:42,729
<i>A bit of a blow to Foreman's</i>
<i>exposure hypothesis</i>

317
00:17:42,796 --> 00:17:44,230
and my plan to get out
of here quickly.

318
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:48,368
<i>Maybe we don't just figure out</i>
<i>the what,</i>

319
00:17:48,436 --> 00:17:50,871
we figure out the why.

320
00:17:50,938 --> 00:17:52,472
Then maybe...

321
00:17:52,540 --> 00:17:54,708
From the size
and the undigested seeds,

322
00:17:54,776 --> 00:17:57,611
<i>I'm guessing this came</i>
<i>from a raccoon.</i>

323
00:17:57,679 --> 00:17:59,146
If you're thinking Q fever,

324
00:17:59,214 --> 00:18:00,949
it fits.

325
00:18:01,016 --> 00:18:02,984
<i>So why are you still looking?</i>

326
00:18:03,052 --> 00:18:05,186
Well, you only found one thing.

327
00:18:05,254 --> 00:18:06,521
<i>It fits perfectly.</i>

328
00:18:06,589 --> 00:18:09,089
<i>Yeah, but that doesn't mean...</i>

329
00:18:10,225 --> 00:18:12,093
Chase.

330
00:18:31,724 --> 00:18:33,558
You missed something
at his place.

331
00:18:34,555 --> 00:18:36,089
His wife.

332
00:18:36,165 --> 00:18:37,032
Nina.

333
00:18:37,034 --> 00:18:38,334
I didn't know where you were.

334
00:18:38,402 --> 00:18:41,538
I'm so sorry.
I couldn't get home.

335
00:18:41,606 --> 00:18:43,240
<i>You okay?</i>

336
00:18:43,308 --> 00:18:44,675
We think you both have Q fever.

337
00:18:44,743 --> 00:18:46,544
Found raccoon feces
in the kitchen cupboard.

338
00:18:46,612 --> 00:18:49,180
We're gonna start you
on Doxycycline.

339
00:18:49,248 --> 00:18:50,915
Why wouldn't you tell us
you're married?

340
00:18:50,983 --> 00:18:52,150
<i>The fewer people who know about her,</i>

341
00:18:52,218 --> 00:18:53,118
<i>the easier it is.</i>

342
00:18:53,186 --> 00:18:54,219
When can I go back?

343
00:18:54,287 --> 00:18:55,587
She gets anxious
when she's away

344
00:18:55,655 --> 00:18:56,721
from her things.

345
00:18:56,789 --> 00:18:57,789
She's the hoarder.
He just lives there.

346
00:18:57,856 --> 00:18:59,424
On purpose?

347
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:04,461
She's my wife.

348
00:19:09,201 --> 00:19:10,734
How do they not have
1/2-inch drill bits?

349
00:19:10,802 --> 00:19:13,103
By the way, Harold's
probably gonna hit on you.

350
00:19:13,171 --> 00:19:15,038
Everything I have, he wants.

351
00:19:15,106 --> 00:19:17,307
Just turn him down flat.

352
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:19,142
Unless...
Yes.

353
00:19:19,210 --> 00:19:20,644
Let's stop shopping.

354
00:19:20,712 --> 00:19:22,546
I'll just do him and get him
to throw the contest.

355
00:19:22,614 --> 00:19:25,916
I'm not sugges...

356
00:19:25,984 --> 00:19:27,919
Would you do that?

357
00:19:27,987 --> 00:19:29,587
How's this thing judged?

358
00:19:29,655 --> 00:19:32,457
Hang time, distance,
and accuracy.

359
00:19:32,524 --> 00:19:33,658
Okay, how about this?

360
00:19:33,726 --> 00:19:35,193
<i>You met a guy in a club,</i>

361
00:19:35,261 --> 00:19:37,529
<i>you brought him home,</i>
<i>he O.D.'d,</i>

362
00:19:37,596 --> 00:19:39,264
so the guy now writhing
on his front porch

363
00:19:39,331 --> 00:19:41,700
was the dealer who sold you
the faulty goods.

364
00:19:41,767 --> 00:19:43,835
Categories weighted the same?
Yup.

365
00:19:43,903 --> 00:19:45,871
Screw accuracy.
We're gonna double distance

366
00:19:45,939 --> 00:19:47,172
and hang time,
beat Harold on points.

367
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:48,606
We need raw power.

368
00:19:48,674 --> 00:19:50,509
Where's the fertilizer?

369
00:19:50,576 --> 00:19:52,610
By all means, Kaczynski.

370
00:20:07,193 --> 00:20:08,693
Hi.

371
00:20:08,761 --> 00:20:10,395
You and Taub
sharing phones now?

372
00:20:10,462 --> 00:20:12,263
He's seeing the redhead
on the third floor.

373
00:20:12,331 --> 00:20:13,764
Please tell me
you're not talking

374
00:20:13,832 --> 00:20:15,266
about the hot new CNA
with the dimples.

375
00:20:15,334 --> 00:20:16,468
She confirmed it.

376
00:20:16,535 --> 00:20:17,969
What she didn't confirm

377
00:20:18,037 --> 00:20:19,571
was their date tonight.

378
00:20:19,638 --> 00:20:20,605
He bailed on her.

379
00:20:20,672 --> 00:20:21,872
If he's standing her up,

380
00:20:21,940 --> 00:20:22,940
he must have something better
going on.

381
00:20:23,008 --> 00:20:25,342
Better than sex
with a 22-year-old?

382
00:20:25,410 --> 00:20:27,545
Who's artie92?

383
00:20:27,613 --> 00:20:28,780
Presumably a 21-year-old.

384
00:20:28,847 --> 00:20:29,980
Whoever it is,

385
00:20:30,048 --> 00:20:31,348
Taub's meeting 'em
at my place at 8:00,

386
00:20:31,416 --> 00:20:33,250
which is usually
when I go to the gym.

387
00:20:33,318 --> 00:20:37,421
Guess you'll be missing
spin class.

388
00:20:41,626 --> 00:20:44,294
Okay, contestants, the field
is now open for practice.

389
00:20:44,362 --> 00:20:45,395
You've got one hour.

390
00:20:45,463 --> 00:20:46,697
Have fun.

391
00:20:46,764 --> 00:20:47,965
Schedule 80 PVC
is pressure rated

392
00:20:48,032 --> 00:20:49,366
for 220 psi,

393
00:20:49,434 --> 00:20:50,567
fuel valve 300.

394
00:20:50,635 --> 00:20:53,036
We can easily push it to 250,

395
00:20:53,104 --> 00:20:55,871
have your friend Harold
peeing in his pants.

396
00:21:12,791 --> 00:21:15,026
Damn.

397
00:21:15,094 --> 00:21:19,096
Be cool.

398
00:21:31,810 --> 00:21:33,577
Harold.

399
00:21:33,645 --> 00:21:35,646
House.

400
00:21:35,713 --> 00:21:37,514
You look good.

401
00:21:37,582 --> 00:21:39,350
I like that jacket on you.

402
00:21:39,417 --> 00:21:41,285
Thanks.

403
00:21:41,353 --> 00:21:43,554
You filled out a little.

404
00:21:43,622 --> 00:21:45,257
Who's the babe?

405
00:21:48,962 --> 00:21:51,230
She's the boot in your ass.

406
00:21:51,297 --> 00:21:53,866
<i>Perhaps you've heard</i>
<i>of famed Russian physicist</i>

407
00:21:53,934 --> 00:21:57,936
<i>Olga Petrovich?</i>

408
00:21:58,004 --> 00:22:00,272
Olga Petrovich is 72 years old.

409
00:22:00,340 --> 00:22:04,076
And her granddaughter

410
00:22:04,143 --> 00:22:06,945
works at a little place
called JPL.

411
00:22:07,013 --> 00:22:10,081
I did an internship there
last summer.

412
00:22:12,652 --> 00:22:13,985
She killed a man.

413
00:22:16,989 --> 00:22:18,089
No.

414
00:22:18,156 --> 00:22:19,590
I'm guessing she didn't do it

415
00:22:19,658 --> 00:22:21,459
with a spud gun.

416
00:22:21,527 --> 00:22:24,263
Just a bad combustion valve.

417
00:22:28,836 --> 00:22:31,104
Shut up.

418
00:22:41,016 --> 00:22:42,416
On my sofa.

419
00:22:42,484 --> 00:22:44,385
Oh. Uh.

420
00:22:44,453 --> 00:22:46,821
Hey.

421
00:22:49,357 --> 00:22:51,559
You remember my wife.

422
00:22:51,626 --> 00:22:53,528
Hi, Eric.

423
00:22:55,831 --> 00:23:00,135
Hey, rt92.

424
00:23:13,315 --> 00:23:16,251
I hope you like rhubarb.

425
00:23:19,122 --> 00:23:20,722
We're celebrating.

426
00:23:20,790 --> 00:23:23,592
We're going rogue.

427
00:23:23,660 --> 00:23:25,395
<i>We rip out</i>
<i>the combustion valve,</i>

428
00:23:25,462 --> 00:23:26,696
replace it with disks.

429
00:23:26,764 --> 00:23:28,197
With enough pressure,

430
00:23:28,265 --> 00:23:30,767
<i>it should blow out</i>
<i>at maximum velocity.</i>

431
00:23:30,835 --> 00:23:34,872
Turning the spud into spudnik.

432
00:23:34,939 --> 00:23:36,473
What do we use for disks?

433
00:23:36,541 --> 00:23:37,909
<i>Well, here's a hint.</i>

434
00:23:37,976 --> 00:23:40,278
<i>I actually hate rhubarb.</i>

435
00:23:40,345 --> 00:23:44,015
Pie tins.

436
00:23:44,082 --> 00:23:46,451
You're a genius.

437
00:23:50,255 --> 00:23:51,923
You know that I'm a doctor.

438
00:23:51,991 --> 00:23:53,992
<i>Any interest I have</i>
<i>in the human body</i>

439
00:23:54,060 --> 00:23:55,294
<i>is purely clinical.</i>

440
00:23:55,361 --> 00:23:57,129
Yeah, that line never works
for me either.

441
00:23:57,197 --> 00:23:59,932
That line always works for you.

442
00:24:12,814 --> 00:24:15,083
So what did you do?

443
00:24:17,019 --> 00:24:17,918
No more guessing?

444
00:24:17,986 --> 00:24:20,921
I need to know.

445
00:24:26,127 --> 00:24:28,695
I can make some phone calls,
see if we can speed up

446
00:24:28,762 --> 00:24:30,830
your medical board hearing.

447
00:24:30,898 --> 00:24:33,332
In the meantime,
no one could stop me

448
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:35,534
from hiring an assistant.

449
00:24:46,914 --> 00:24:49,617
You were right this morning.

450
00:24:53,722 --> 00:24:55,557
I met a guy at a coffee shop,

451
00:24:55,625 --> 00:24:56,959
we went back to my place,

452
00:24:57,026 --> 00:25:02,531
and he O.D.'d.

453
00:25:02,599 --> 00:25:03,799
Damn.

454
00:25:03,867 --> 00:25:07,002
I could have saved myself
a job offer.

455
00:25:07,070 --> 00:25:10,106
We both acted like idiots.

456
00:25:10,174 --> 00:25:14,044
And I ended up doing time.

457
00:25:14,111 --> 00:25:16,947
Guess he did more.

458
00:25:28,961 --> 00:25:30,128
<i>When we first moved into the house,</i>

459
00:25:30,196 --> 00:25:31,729
<i>we had people over</i>
<i>all the time.</i>

460
00:25:31,797 --> 00:25:36,067
Then she started
collecting things.

461
00:25:36,135 --> 00:25:37,969
I figured it was a hobby.

462
00:25:38,037 --> 00:25:40,605
Piles turned into art projects,

463
00:25:40,673 --> 00:25:45,442
and art projects turned
into what you saw.

464
00:25:48,546 --> 00:25:50,714
So why do you stay?

465
00:25:50,781 --> 00:25:56,152
To everyone else,
the world is full of junk...

466
00:25:56,220 --> 00:25:58,956
meaningless, ugly,
broken things.

467
00:25:59,023 --> 00:26:00,691
But to Nina,

468
00:26:00,758 --> 00:26:03,928
every shape,

469
00:26:03,996 --> 00:26:06,497
every color, texture, smell,

470
00:26:06,565 --> 00:26:09,334
they all tell a story.

471
00:26:09,402 --> 00:26:12,604
<i>They're all worth treasuring.</i>

472
00:26:12,672 --> 00:26:13,939
<i>I wouldn't wish what she has</i>
<i>on anyone,</i>

473
00:26:14,007 --> 00:26:16,942
but every now and then
I get a glimpse

474
00:26:17,010 --> 00:26:20,579
of what she sees, and...

475
00:26:20,647 --> 00:26:21,947
It helps.

476
00:26:30,389 --> 00:26:32,524
Your lungs
are clearing up nicely.

477
00:26:32,591 --> 00:26:34,992
Respiratory rate's normal.
Temp's normal.

478
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:36,827
Looks like you're
gonna be fine.

479
00:26:41,767 --> 00:26:43,300
She okay?

480
00:26:43,368 --> 00:26:45,369
Something's wrong
with her heart.

481
00:27:23,458 --> 00:27:25,658
The husband is fine.
The wife is worse.

482
00:27:25,771 --> 00:27:26,615
<i>She had a heart attack.</i>

483
00:27:26,616 --> 00:27:27,382
<i>Her heart attack could be</i>

484
00:27:27,448 --> 00:27:28,815
from a complication.

485
00:27:28,883 --> 00:27:30,684
Q fever would cause
congestive heart failure,

486
00:27:30,752 --> 00:27:32,987
not myocardial infarction.

487
00:27:33,055 --> 00:27:34,522
<i>So she had Q fever and something else</i>

488
00:27:34,589 --> 00:27:36,190
that causes heart attack?

489
00:27:36,258 --> 00:27:38,093
And the hoarding. Now that
the wife is the only patient,

490
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:39,327
hoard is back on the board.

491
00:27:39,395 --> 00:27:41,363
Or we were wrong about Q fever.

492
00:27:41,430 --> 00:27:42,764
<i>I don't buy</i>
<i>it's just a coincidence.</i>

493
00:27:42,832 --> 00:27:44,033
<i>It's not a coincidence.</i>

494
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:45,834
<i>Diagnosis X</i>
<i>caused the hoarding,</i>

495
00:27:45,902 --> 00:27:48,104
which caused the Q fever
when the raccoons came

496
00:27:48,172 --> 00:27:49,672
to spend spring break
at her house.

497
00:27:49,740 --> 00:27:51,441
<i>Now all we have to do</i>
<i>is solve for x.</i>

498
00:27:51,508 --> 00:27:54,310
I remember somebody saying that
hoarding could be a symptom.

499
00:27:54,378 --> 00:27:55,645
<i>We should do an MRI.</i>

500
00:27:55,712 --> 00:27:58,213
Hydrogen sulfide.

501
00:27:58,281 --> 00:28:02,184
<i>It's given off by eggs</i>
<i>and rotting food.</i>

502
00:28:02,251 --> 00:28:04,152
Long-term exposure could cause
the pulmonary issues,

503
00:28:04,220 --> 00:28:05,320
headaches...
<i>Even the heart attack.</i>

504
00:28:05,388 --> 00:28:07,623
Hydrogen sulfide
is also a vasodilator.

505
00:28:07,690 --> 00:28:09,991
<i>Which my crack team</i>
<i>never tested the place for.</i>

506
00:28:10,059 --> 00:28:11,626
Of course, half my crack team

507
00:28:11,694 --> 00:28:13,294
never tested
the place for people.

508
00:28:13,362 --> 00:28:15,029
<i>So we should go back,</i>

509
00:28:15,097 --> 00:28:16,698
check it out.
<i>Might be safer</i>

510
00:28:16,765 --> 00:28:18,433
to just assume we're right
and start treatment.

511
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:19,533
<i>Go with God.</i>

512
00:28:19,601 --> 00:28:21,669
<i>And some air freshener.</i>

513
00:28:21,737 --> 00:28:23,471
You know, maybe Taub is right,

514
00:28:23,539 --> 00:28:26,375
so I'm gonna stay here with him
and help him with the MRI.

515
00:28:38,590 --> 00:28:39,890
Shine up your spuds, folks.

516
00:28:39,958 --> 00:28:40,925
We're gonna start shooting
for hang time

517
00:28:40,993 --> 00:28:42,627
in just a few minutes.

518
00:28:42,695 --> 00:28:45,363
The wind's coming
from the southeast.

519
00:28:45,431 --> 00:28:47,900
You have to aim five degrees
to the left.

520
00:28:47,967 --> 00:28:49,768
We're gonna break 14 seconds.
I can feel it.

521
00:28:49,835 --> 00:28:52,437
When I was 10 or 11,

522
00:28:52,505 --> 00:28:54,039
my dad used to take us
to this county fair.

523
00:28:54,107 --> 00:28:58,110
And there was this kid...

524
00:28:58,178 --> 00:28:59,678
What?

525
00:28:59,745 --> 00:29:02,681
Who's "us"?

526
00:29:02,748 --> 00:29:04,549
My mom and me.

527
00:29:06,585 --> 00:29:09,320
Your mom who had
advanced stage Huntington's.

528
00:29:12,358 --> 00:29:16,929
You have a sibling
that you've never mentioned.

529
00:29:16,997 --> 00:29:18,364
Why did you slip up now?

530
00:29:18,432 --> 00:29:21,000
Not everything means something.

531
00:29:21,068 --> 00:29:22,402
We're gonna be up soon.

532
00:29:22,470 --> 00:29:25,272
I want to check the pressure.

533
00:29:27,242 --> 00:29:30,311
You don't wake up in the middle
of the night to cry

534
00:29:30,379 --> 00:29:31,746
<i>over a dead stranger.</i>

535
00:29:31,813 --> 00:29:33,714
You don't confess
to killing a man

536
00:29:33,782 --> 00:29:35,116
and then hide the details

537
00:29:35,184 --> 00:29:36,884
unless the details reveal
more about you

538
00:29:36,952 --> 00:29:40,688
than the crime itself.

539
00:29:40,756 --> 00:29:41,890
You pled down to drugs.

540
00:29:41,957 --> 00:29:45,060
You've got
a horrible genetic disease

541
00:29:45,127 --> 00:29:49,364
and a sibling
who's suddenly on your mind.

542
00:29:51,501 --> 00:29:54,436
You euthanized your brother.

543
00:29:54,503 --> 00:29:56,371
And that guy back at the house
was the doctor

544
00:29:56,439 --> 00:30:01,143
who wouldn't help you
cover it up.

545
00:30:01,211 --> 00:30:02,444
The guy back at the house

546
00:30:02,512 --> 00:30:04,046
is my cellmate's boyfriend.

547
00:30:04,114 --> 00:30:07,349
He cheated on her
when she was inside.

548
00:30:07,417 --> 00:30:10,586
But I was right
about everything else.

549
00:30:13,022 --> 00:30:15,257
Congratulations.

550
00:30:31,540 --> 00:30:34,375
You're mad.

551
00:30:34,443 --> 00:30:35,577
No.

552
00:30:35,644 --> 00:30:37,812
Actually, I'm impressed.

553
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:40,281
Messing around
on a 22-year-old hottie

554
00:30:40,349 --> 00:30:42,416
with your wife on my sofa.

555
00:30:42,484 --> 00:30:44,618
You're a full-throttle
head case.

556
00:30:44,686 --> 00:30:46,153
I was doing you a solid
with the sofa.

557
00:30:46,221 --> 00:30:48,322
Rachel wanted to do it
in your bed.

558
00:30:48,389 --> 00:30:50,357
You've got the memory foam top.

559
00:30:50,424 --> 00:30:52,058
Let's make this really simple:

560
00:30:52,126 --> 00:30:55,829
If I own it, I don't
want you doing it on it.

561
00:30:55,896 --> 00:30:59,064
You might want to get rid
of your kitchen table.

562
00:30:59,132 --> 00:31:01,800
<i>Look, I'm sorry,</i>

563
00:31:01,868 --> 00:31:03,868
<i>but it was worth it.</i>
Yeah, I bet.

564
00:31:03,936 --> 00:31:05,403
<i>You get to mess with her</i>
<i>physically and emotionally.</i>

565
00:31:05,471 --> 00:31:06,871
I still care about her.

566
00:31:06,939 --> 00:31:09,040
Not enough to let her move on
with her life.

567
00:31:11,578 --> 00:31:14,213
<i>While we're talking</i>
<i>about your bad ideas,</i>

568
00:31:14,281 --> 00:31:16,015
MRI's clean.

569
00:31:16,082 --> 00:31:18,417
There has to be some kind

570
00:31:18,485 --> 00:31:21,387
of inciting
psychological incident.

571
00:31:21,455 --> 00:31:23,489
This is perfect for you.

572
00:31:23,557 --> 00:31:26,393
You get all
the human interaction you crave

573
00:31:26,461 --> 00:31:28,328
without any actual
human interaction.

574
00:31:28,396 --> 00:31:30,631
She was a cheerleader.
Huh.

575
00:31:30,699 --> 00:31:31,831
<i>You know when you're interested</i>
<i>in something</i>

576
00:31:31,899 --> 00:31:33,333
and nobody else is,
the polite thing

577
00:31:33,401 --> 00:31:34,834
is to keep it to yourself.

578
00:31:34,902 --> 00:31:36,102
<i>Popular, beautiful,</i>

579
00:31:36,170 --> 00:31:37,570
gregarious.

580
00:31:37,637 --> 00:31:39,705
Hydrogen sulfide's
about two parts per billion.

581
00:31:39,773 --> 00:31:42,174
The size of a healthy fart.

582
00:31:45,444 --> 00:31:49,513
I'll be back for you in July.

583
00:32:07,334 --> 00:32:10,771
He couldn't do it himself.

584
00:32:10,838 --> 00:32:14,375
He was...the disease
had progressed too far.

585
00:32:14,442 --> 00:32:15,809
He was flailing.

586
00:32:15,877 --> 00:32:20,480
He didn't have any control
over his own body.

587
00:32:20,548 --> 00:32:25,251
He pretty much lost control
of his mind too,

588
00:32:25,319 --> 00:32:27,019
but...

589
00:32:27,087 --> 00:32:29,521
Every once in a while,
he would have a few seconds

590
00:32:29,589 --> 00:32:32,824
of lucidity.

591
00:32:32,892 --> 00:32:35,693
He turned to me, and he said,

592
00:32:35,761 --> 00:32:39,598
"it's time."

593
00:32:39,666 --> 00:32:44,503
I hooked up the I.V.

594
00:32:44,571 --> 00:32:46,338
I used gloves.
I knew they'd get me

595
00:32:46,406 --> 00:32:47,539
on the drugs,
but they couldn't prove

596
00:32:47,607 --> 00:32:50,475
who pushed the plunger.

597
00:33:00,687 --> 00:33:04,224
I put in the needle,

598
00:33:04,292 --> 00:33:06,960
and he just...

599
00:33:07,028 --> 00:33:09,696
Got quiet.

600
00:33:09,764 --> 00:33:12,599
And it was over.

601
00:33:15,903 --> 00:33:20,439
And I was alone.

602
00:33:20,507 --> 00:33:23,675
And one day,
I will be that sick,

603
00:33:23,743 --> 00:33:26,311
and there will be no one there

604
00:33:26,379 --> 00:33:29,247
when it's time.

605
00:33:49,936 --> 00:33:53,372
I didn't expect compassion
from you.

606
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:55,608
I would have taken
commiseration.

607
00:33:55,676 --> 00:33:58,511
Hell, I would have taken
revulsion,

608
00:33:58,579 --> 00:34:02,348
any emotional engagement
at all.

609
00:34:05,953 --> 00:34:09,756
It's no wonder
Cuddy broke up with you.

610
00:34:30,077 --> 00:34:33,746
Folks, Chad Lockerbie just won

611
00:34:33,814 --> 00:34:35,414
first place
in the chili cook-off.

612
00:34:35,482 --> 00:34:37,116
Congratulations, Chad.

613
00:34:37,184 --> 00:34:40,919
That cocoa powder
really did it.

614
00:34:40,987 --> 00:34:43,155
<i>Dumped in a field in Schenectady.</i>

615
00:34:43,222 --> 00:34:44,656
<i>Ouch.</i>

616
00:34:44,724 --> 00:34:46,224
<i>You mind if I make a move?</i>

617
00:34:46,292 --> 00:34:48,160
I know she's out of my league,

618
00:34:48,227 --> 00:34:49,428
but she's at a spud gun contest

619
00:34:49,495 --> 00:34:51,363
with the soon-to-be
five-time runner-up,

620
00:34:51,431 --> 00:34:55,168
so she's probably got
some self-esteem issues.

621
00:35:03,446 --> 00:35:04,446
You wouldn't.

622
00:35:40,124 --> 00:35:43,125
So?
Warning.

623
00:35:43,433 --> 00:35:44,434
They gave you a warning?

624
00:35:44,472 --> 00:35:46,107
Well, it turns out
our friend Harold

625
00:35:46,175 --> 00:35:47,876
felt up the sheriff's daughter

626
00:35:47,943 --> 00:35:49,711
last night
at the potato mash mixer,

627
00:35:49,779 --> 00:35:51,781
so sheriff's feeling
kind of ambivalent.

628
00:35:51,848 --> 00:35:55,151
You always get your way,
don't you?

629
00:35:57,087 --> 00:35:58,655
Not always.

630
00:36:01,158 --> 00:36:05,494
Today would have been
our one-year anniversary.

631
00:36:08,665 --> 00:36:11,667
Which is an incredibly
arbitrary thing to celebrate.

632
00:36:17,174 --> 00:36:18,441
If you want to get
to the bottom of something,

633
00:36:18,509 --> 00:36:21,879
you literally have
to dig down to the bottom.

634
00:36:21,947 --> 00:36:25,383
So stratigraphically,
the oldest stuff I found

635
00:36:25,450 --> 00:36:26,784
was in the bedroom.

636
00:36:26,852 --> 00:36:27,752
<i>And the oldest stuff</i>
<i>in the bedroom</i>

637
00:36:27,820 --> 00:36:29,688
<i>was in the closet.</i>

638
00:36:29,756 --> 00:36:32,391
<i>And at the bottom</i>
<i>of the closet...</i>

639
00:36:36,063 --> 00:36:37,396
Tell me about this.

640
00:36:42,068 --> 00:36:44,235
<i>We have a new symptom.</i>

641
00:36:44,303 --> 00:36:45,703
<i>Infertility.</i>

642
00:36:45,771 --> 00:36:47,438
<i>They wanted kids</i>
<i>but couldn't have them.</i>

643
00:36:47,506 --> 00:36:49,807
She started collecting things
to fill the void.

644
00:36:49,875 --> 00:36:52,042
<i>We should run</i>
<i>a full hormone blood panel.</i>

645
00:36:52,110 --> 00:36:53,744
Hey, Harriet the Spy,

646
00:36:53,812 --> 00:36:55,246
<i>before you get too full</i>
<i>of yourself,</i>

647
00:36:55,313 --> 00:36:57,114
<i>you might want to go back</i>
<i>to bio 101.</i>

648
00:36:57,182 --> 00:36:59,017
It takes two
to not-tango.

649
00:36:59,084 --> 00:37:01,252
<i>Hubby could be shooting blanks.</i>

650
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:04,923
So either it's a new symptom
that will help us save her life

651
00:37:04,991 --> 00:37:05,958
or it's a complete
waste of time.

652
00:37:07,861 --> 00:37:10,129
Figure out which is fried,
the bacon or the eggs.

653
00:37:10,197 --> 00:37:11,764
I'll start the hormone workup.

654
00:37:11,832 --> 00:37:14,234
<i>There's another option.</i>

655
00:37:14,301 --> 00:37:15,235
<i>House, who's that?</i>

656
00:37:15,303 --> 00:37:17,104
Radio.

657
00:37:17,172 --> 00:37:18,705
<i>Sounded a lot</i> <i>like Thirteen.</i>

658
00:37:18,772 --> 00:37:21,174
It's a Thirteen tribute band
with their new song,

659
00:37:21,242 --> 00:37:22,875
"I've got a better theory
than Masters."

660
00:37:22,943 --> 00:37:24,643
<i>She said they never had kids.</i>

661
00:37:24,711 --> 00:37:26,979
Oh, my God.
Where the hell have you been?

662
00:37:27,046 --> 00:37:30,181
I think we've all got something
a little more important

663
00:37:30,249 --> 00:37:31,749
to worry about than...
<i>No, we don't.</i>

664
00:37:31,817 --> 00:37:33,317
<i>She's been missing for a year.</i>

665
00:37:33,385 --> 00:37:36,287
You can ask her all about it
when she comes in on Monday.

666
00:37:36,355 --> 00:37:37,254
<i>Monday?</i>

667
00:37:37,322 --> 00:37:38,456
This Monday?

668
00:37:38,524 --> 00:37:39,757
<i>Can I talk?</i>

669
00:37:39,825 --> 00:37:41,292
She said they never had kids,

670
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:42,961
and you all jumped
to infertility.

671
00:37:43,029 --> 00:37:47,600
You never considered
the other option.

672
00:37:50,637 --> 00:37:53,873
And the bitch is back.

673
00:38:01,014 --> 00:38:03,315
We think you have
Ehlers-Danlos syndrome.

674
00:38:03,383 --> 00:38:06,285
It would explain the symptoms.

675
00:38:06,352 --> 00:38:10,088
It also causes miscarriages.

676
00:38:13,592 --> 00:38:16,527
Is that something
you think you might have?

677
00:38:28,341 --> 00:38:31,444
Were you pregnant?

678
00:38:34,415 --> 00:38:36,249
Three times.

679
00:38:40,688 --> 00:38:43,790
<i>The miscarriages</i>
<i>triggered the hoarding.</i>

680
00:38:43,858 --> 00:38:47,561
<i>Hoarding eventually</i>
<i>made you sick too.</i>

681
00:38:47,629 --> 00:38:50,164
Can you cure her?

682
00:38:50,232 --> 00:38:52,199
<i>We can treat</i>
<i>the physical symptoms</i>

683
00:38:52,267 --> 00:38:54,235
<i>as they arise,</i>

684
00:38:54,303 --> 00:38:56,370
<i>make her life</i> <i>a lot better,</i>

685
00:38:56,438 --> 00:38:59,373
but the hoarding,

686
00:38:59,441 --> 00:39:01,709
we're the wrong kind
of doctors.

687
00:39:05,781 --> 00:39:08,383
You lied to me?

688
00:39:08,450 --> 00:39:11,218
For nine years?

689
00:39:11,286 --> 00:39:15,656
I was so afraid of losing you.

690
00:39:18,394 --> 00:39:21,429
What have I ever done
to make you afraid of that?

691
00:39:26,970 --> 00:39:29,505
I need to get some air.

692
00:39:47,390 --> 00:39:48,757
I've been selfish.

693
00:39:48,824 --> 00:39:51,625
I need to let you

694
00:39:51,693 --> 00:39:54,861
move on.

695
00:39:54,929 --> 00:39:59,099
I think we should stop
seeing each other.

696
00:39:59,167 --> 00:40:00,400
No.

697
00:40:02,504 --> 00:40:04,271
Um, I just want you
to be able to...

698
00:40:04,339 --> 00:40:06,040
the last time
you got all noble on me,

699
00:40:06,108 --> 00:40:08,242
we ended up dividing
our dishes.

700
00:40:08,310 --> 00:40:10,644
This time, I want
to make the decision.

701
00:40:10,712 --> 00:40:13,714
You don't feel weird
about this?

702
00:40:13,782 --> 00:40:16,483
Of course
I feel weird about this.

703
00:40:16,551 --> 00:40:19,219
It's confusing and messy

704
00:40:19,287 --> 00:40:21,388
and dirty.

705
00:40:21,455 --> 00:40:23,990
Dumb.

706
00:40:24,058 --> 00:40:25,458
But we spent our whole lives
trying to do everything right,

707
00:40:25,526 --> 00:40:27,126
and it sucked.
It wasn't all bad.

708
00:40:27,194 --> 00:40:29,095
It sucked, Chris.

709
00:40:29,162 --> 00:40:31,363
And this,

710
00:40:31,431 --> 00:40:33,265
whatever it is,

711
00:40:33,333 --> 00:40:34,833
it's fun.

712
00:40:34,901 --> 00:40:40,305
So I'm not
taking advantage of you?

713
00:40:40,373 --> 00:40:43,042
The fun is fading.

714
00:40:45,814 --> 00:40:48,982
You know...

715
00:40:49,050 --> 00:40:51,385
there's something
seriously wrong with us.

716
00:40:53,089 --> 00:40:54,990
I know.

717
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:28,323
? don't leave ?

718
00:41:28,391 --> 00:41:33,429
? 'cause I believe ?

719
00:41:33,497 --> 00:41:36,233
? we were meant ?

720
00:41:36,300 --> 00:41:39,236
? to sleep ?

721
00:41:39,304 --> 00:41:42,072
? in the dirt ?

722
00:41:51,717 --> 00:41:53,651
Home, sweet home.

723
00:41:56,522 --> 00:42:01,360
You owe me 87 bucks for gas.

724
00:42:09,838 --> 00:42:15,276
I'll kill you.

725
00:42:15,344 --> 00:42:18,980
When the time comes,
if you want me to.

726
00:42:24,119 --> 00:42:25,319
I'll do it now if you like.

727
00:42:25,386 --> 00:42:27,921
I think I've got
a baseball bat in the back.

728
00:42:42,669 --> 00:42:45,238
I'll see you Monday.

729
00:43:00,889 --> 00:43:04,389
