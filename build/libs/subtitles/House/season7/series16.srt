1
00:00:03,087 --> 00:00:06,356
<i>? there are things ?</i>

2
00:00:06,423 --> 00:00:10,477
? I have done ?

3
00:00:10,544 --> 00:00:13,897
? there's a place ?

4
00:00:13,948 --> 00:00:17,651
? I have gone ?

5
00:00:17,735 --> 00:00:20,770
? there's a beast ?

6
00:00:20,821 --> 00:00:24,491
? and I let it run ?

7
00:00:24,575 --> 00:00:30,830
? now it's running my way ?

8
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:35,719
? there are things ?

9
00:00:35,786 --> 00:00:39,422
? I regret ?

10
00:00:39,473 --> 00:00:42,008
? but you can't forgive ?

11
00:00:42,093 --> 00:00:46,396
? you can't forget ?

12
00:00:46,463 --> 00:00:50,633
? so take this night ?

13
00:00:50,685 --> 00:00:54,303
? wrap it around me
like a sheet ?

14
00:00:54,355 --> 00:00:58,241
? I know I'm not forgiven ?

15
00:00:58,308 --> 00:01:01,077
? but I hope
that I'll be given ?

16
00:01:01,145 --> 00:01:05,498
? some peace ?

17
00:01:05,583 --> 00:01:13,340
? ?

18
00:01:23,584 --> 00:01:24,985
One. Don't tense up now.

19
00:01:25,052 --> 00:01:26,102
Go with him.

20
00:01:31,809 --> 00:01:34,227
Two. That's it.
Stay in rhythm.

21
00:01:37,982 --> 00:01:39,265
Three.
What are you doing, Lane?

22
00:01:39,333 --> 00:01:40,316
You're tipping in.

23
00:01:43,371 --> 00:01:44,537
Four.
What's your problem?

24
00:01:44,622 --> 00:01:46,206
Get your ass down.
Get back in the middle.

25
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:51,044
Five. You're weak.

26
00:01:51,128 --> 00:01:52,796
You got all kinds
of daylight under you.

27
00:01:55,199 --> 00:01:58,334
Six. Damn, Lane, you should
be schooling this bull.

28
00:02:01,705 --> 00:02:04,924
Seven. Get up, set your hips
before the kick comes down.

29
00:02:08,963 --> 00:02:10,397
Nice recovery.

30
00:02:10,481 --> 00:02:12,649
Now just wait till he turns
back away from your hand.

31
00:02:22,276 --> 00:02:30,333
? ?

32
00:02:33,954 --> 00:02:35,255
Whoo!

33
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:24,954
Hey. Hey.

34
00:03:27,892 --> 00:03:29,509
What the hell
just happened?

35
00:03:29,593 --> 00:03:31,845
I was about to ask you
the same thing.

36
00:03:37,434 --> 00:03:41,503
<font color=#00FF00>? House 7x16 ?</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>Out of the Chute</font>
<font color=#000000>Original Air Date on March 14, 2011</font>

37
00:03:41,570 --> 00:03:45,644
-- Sync, corrected by <font color="#00ff00">elderman</font> --

38
00:04:11,501 --> 00:04:13,269
I'm fine.

39
00:04:14,671 --> 00:04:15,805
Okay.

40
00:04:15,856 --> 00:04:18,608
I assume Cuddy told you
that she dumped me.

41
00:04:18,675 --> 00:04:19,893
She did.

42
00:04:19,977 --> 00:04:21,361
And that
I'm back on Vicodin.

43
00:04:21,445 --> 00:04:24,531
She told me you
had taken <i>a</i> Vicodin.

44
00:04:24,615 --> 00:04:26,533
And then I took <i>a</i> lot more.

45
00:04:26,617 --> 00:04:28,067
And so on.

46
00:04:30,154 --> 00:04:31,821
But you're fine?

47
00:04:31,872 --> 00:04:33,323
Well,
I'm not fine as in "fine,"

48
00:04:33,374 --> 00:04:35,909
but I'm fine as in "you don't
have to worry about me."

49
00:04:35,993 --> 00:04:37,627
Because you cleared out
your bank account,

50
00:04:37,694 --> 00:04:39,862
checked into a hotel,
and started back on Vicodin?

51
00:04:39,914 --> 00:04:42,999
Because I'm going to be fine
as in "fine" very soon.

52
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:44,500
Until that happens,

53
00:04:44,552 --> 00:04:46,502
are you sure
Vicodin is the...

54
00:04:46,554 --> 00:04:47,670
My leg hurts.

55
00:04:47,721 --> 00:04:50,039
You've been able
to handle the pain.

56
00:04:50,090 --> 00:04:51,140
It's gotten worse.

57
00:04:51,208 --> 00:04:52,392
Not physically worse.

58
00:04:52,476 --> 00:04:53,626
Worse is worse.

59
00:04:53,694 --> 00:04:54,877
<i>Pain doesn't discriminate.</i>

60
00:04:54,929 --> 00:04:56,846
Neither do the pills.

61
00:04:56,897 --> 00:04:59,682
The Vicodin
and the five-star pampering

62
00:04:59,733 --> 00:05:01,885
that I'm gonna get
over the next few days

63
00:05:01,952 --> 00:05:03,336
should be enough
to get me through it.

64
00:05:03,404 --> 00:05:04,737
<i>So you don't want</i>
<i>to just avoid the issue.</i>

65
00:05:04,822 --> 00:05:07,607
You want to avoid
avoiding the issue. Sorry.

66
00:05:07,691 --> 00:05:09,108
Nothing is either
as bad or as good

67
00:05:09,193 --> 00:05:10,393
as we think it is
at the time.

68
00:05:10,444 --> 00:05:12,946
That's why T.O.
mocks his opponents immediately

69
00:05:13,013 --> 00:05:13,947
<i>after scoring.</i>

70
00:05:14,014 --> 00:05:15,281
<i>He doesn't wait</i>

71
00:05:15,366 --> 00:05:17,000
till his friend shows up
the next day

72
00:05:17,067 --> 00:05:18,618
<i>to tell him to deal with it.</i>

73
00:05:18,702 --> 00:05:20,403
Two weeks from now,

74
00:05:20,454 --> 00:05:22,455
maybe a little more,
maybe a little less,

75
00:05:22,539 --> 00:05:25,574
my life will be back to its
usual level of crappiness.

76
00:05:25,626 --> 00:05:26,909
Till then,
the only real issue

77
00:05:26,961 --> 00:05:29,245
is how much I'm gonna spend
on hotel charges.

78
00:05:29,296 --> 00:05:30,913
Good morning, sir.

79
00:05:30,965 --> 00:05:33,433
I've got your deluxe
breakfast for two.

80
00:05:33,517 --> 00:05:34,917
Do I have to count
the strawberries?

81
00:05:34,969 --> 00:05:36,019
<i>Don't worry.</i>

82
00:05:36,086 --> 00:05:37,854
You can trust me
with anything.

83
00:05:37,921 --> 00:05:40,139
Including your food.

84
00:05:40,224 --> 00:05:42,258
After he and I have sex,

85
00:05:42,309 --> 00:05:43,393
<i>I'm gonna slit his throat</i>

86
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:45,028
and then disembowel him
in the bathtub.

87
00:05:45,095 --> 00:05:47,230
Oh, no problem. I'll cancel
the morning maid service.

88
00:05:47,281 --> 00:05:48,948
Would you like me
to have them clean up later

89
00:05:49,033 --> 00:05:50,433
when they come
to turn down your bed?

90
00:05:50,501 --> 00:05:53,602
Why didn't I meet you
six months ago?

91
00:05:53,654 --> 00:05:54,854
Thank you very much.

92
00:05:54,922 --> 00:05:56,205
And if there's
anything else I can do

93
00:05:56,273 --> 00:05:57,490
to make your stay here
more enjoyable,

94
00:05:57,574 --> 00:06:00,743
just ring the concierge
and ask for Carnell.

95
00:06:02,713 --> 00:06:04,280
Eat fast.

96
00:06:04,331 --> 00:06:06,482
We're expecting company.

97
00:06:06,550 --> 00:06:07,634
Okay.

98
00:06:07,701 --> 00:06:09,585
This might not be
such a bad idea.

99
00:06:14,108 --> 00:06:16,476
What do you think he meant
by "anything"?

100
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:22,415
Take some time for yourself.
Relax.

101
00:06:22,483 --> 00:06:25,051
I know it's a figure
of speech,

102
00:06:25,119 --> 00:06:28,905
but he really did seem
to underline the "anything."

103
00:06:28,972 --> 00:06:30,306
Maybe talk to someone?

104
00:06:30,357 --> 00:06:31,774
Already scheduled.

105
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:34,277
Really?

106
00:06:35,829 --> 00:06:36,829
I'm not an idiot.

107
00:06:36,914 --> 00:06:39,499
I know I need help.

108
00:06:39,583 --> 00:06:41,117
Okay.

109
00:06:41,168 --> 00:06:42,702
That's...great.

110
00:06:44,838 --> 00:06:47,290
I meant, like, a counselor.

111
00:06:47,341 --> 00:06:48,825
I know.

112
00:06:48,892 --> 00:06:51,277
But you meant a hooker.

113
00:06:51,345 --> 00:06:52,879
Yeah.

114
00:06:54,298 --> 00:06:55,598
Baby steps.

115
00:06:58,552 --> 00:06:59,602
House screwed us.

116
00:06:59,669 --> 00:07:01,270
<i>Ten years of doctors</i>

117
00:07:01,338 --> 00:07:02,855
cobbling him
back together.

118
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:04,840
Metal rods in every limb.

119
00:07:04,892 --> 00:07:06,476
Pins stabilizing his spine.

120
00:07:06,527 --> 00:07:07,727
Five screws

121
00:07:07,811 --> 00:07:09,779
and a titanium plate
in his skull.

122
00:07:09,846 --> 00:07:11,013
Can't do MRIs.

123
00:07:11,065 --> 00:07:12,899
X-rays are probably
gonna be useless as well.

124
00:07:12,983 --> 00:07:14,683
Every piece of metal
is gonna obscure something.

125
00:07:14,735 --> 00:07:16,619
And House isn't sick.

126
00:07:16,686 --> 00:07:18,321
Why would you say that?

127
00:07:18,372 --> 00:07:19,572
Cuddy dumped House.

128
00:07:19,656 --> 00:07:21,491
He's out somewhere
expecting us to indulge him

129
00:07:21,542 --> 00:07:23,526
<i>while he ignores his job</i>
<i>and licks his wounds.</i>

130
00:07:23,577 --> 00:07:24,794
Cuddy dumped him?

131
00:07:24,861 --> 00:07:27,130
Don't do that.
Don't get sucked in.

132
00:07:27,197 --> 00:07:28,531
He loves her. What?

133
00:07:28,582 --> 00:07:29,882
You can't feel bad for him
for five minutes?

134
00:07:29,967 --> 00:07:32,635
I can feel bad for him
while still expecting him

135
00:07:32,702 --> 00:07:34,170
to act like an adult,
show up for work,

136
00:07:34,221 --> 00:07:35,488
and not go on a booze-,

137
00:07:35,556 --> 00:07:37,873
<i>Vicodin-,</i>
<i>and hooker-filled bender.</i>

138
00:07:37,925 --> 00:07:40,176
Which is why for now we're gonna
handle the case without him.

139
00:07:40,227 --> 00:07:41,728
Oh, is that the reason?

140
00:07:41,795 --> 00:07:43,062
<i>I thought it was because</i>
<i>you can't pass up</i>

141
00:07:43,147 --> 00:07:44,280
any chance to seize control.

142
00:07:44,348 --> 00:07:45,998
I said "we."
You want "pretty please" too?

143
00:07:46,066 --> 00:07:47,734
Wait. I understand the booze

144
00:07:47,818 --> 00:07:50,737
and the hookers,
but why Vicodin?

145
00:07:50,821 --> 00:07:53,489
Wow, you really don't have
any friends in here, do you?

146
00:07:53,557 --> 00:07:57,009
House is a Vicodin addict.

147
00:07:57,077 --> 00:07:58,444
He's been clean
for two years.

148
00:07:58,529 --> 00:08:00,580
He's used here at work?

149
00:08:00,664 --> 00:08:02,081
<i>Yes, that is very troubling.</i>

150
00:08:02,149 --> 00:08:04,183
<i>Almost as much as the fact</i>

151
00:08:04,251 --> 00:08:05,551
that our patient
has a ruptured diaphragm,

152
00:08:05,619 --> 00:08:06,519
cracked sternum,
broken nose,

153
00:08:06,587 --> 00:08:07,920
and partial hearing loss,

154
00:08:08,005 --> 00:08:10,456
<i>which can be explained</i>
<i>by a bull jumping on him.</i>

155
00:08:10,541 --> 00:08:12,375
And a neurological disorder,
low-grade fever,

156
00:08:12,426 --> 00:08:14,844
nausea, and peripheral muscle
weakness that can't.

157
00:08:14,911 --> 00:08:16,646
What if the hearing loss
wasn't caused by the bull?

158
00:08:16,713 --> 00:08:18,131
That's just
when he noticed it?

159
00:08:18,198 --> 00:08:20,683
<i>Inner-ear pathology</i>
<i>can affect the equilibrium</i>

160
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:22,802
and cause disorientation,

161
00:08:22,886 --> 00:08:24,420
making it appear to be
a neurological disorder.

162
00:08:24,471 --> 00:08:26,022
So how do we confirm?

163
00:08:26,089 --> 00:08:28,224
CT is just gonna show us
the plate and screws

164
00:08:28,275 --> 00:08:29,758
holding his skull together.

165
00:08:29,810 --> 00:08:31,110
We can do calorics
and an ENG.

166
00:08:31,195 --> 00:08:32,261
<i>If he has inner-ear damage,</i>

167
00:08:32,312 --> 00:08:33,646
it'll affect his balance.

168
00:08:33,730 --> 00:08:35,615
Sounds good. Go ahead.

169
00:08:35,699 --> 00:08:37,867
Go ahead? Really?

170
00:08:37,934 --> 00:08:39,485
What if one of us
disagrees?

171
00:08:44,324 --> 00:08:45,941
I happen to agree
with Foreman.

172
00:08:45,993 --> 00:08:47,827
Go do it.

173
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:51,113
You knew he was an addict
before you got involved.

174
00:08:51,165 --> 00:08:52,131
Didn't end
the relationship--

175
00:08:52,216 --> 00:08:53,282
You knew he was an ass--

176
00:08:53,333 --> 00:08:55,251
I didn't end it--

177
00:08:55,302 --> 00:08:57,136
you told him you did not
want him to change.

178
00:08:57,221 --> 00:08:58,171
And I was wrong.

179
00:08:58,238 --> 00:08:59,755
You don't know that.

180
00:08:59,807 --> 00:09:02,758
<i>You thought</i>
<i>you were gonna die.</i>

181
00:09:02,810 --> 00:09:04,310
<i>Do you really think</i>
<i>that was the right time</i>

182
00:09:04,378 --> 00:09:05,961
<i>to make this kind</i>
<i>of decision?</i>

183
00:09:06,013 --> 00:09:07,146
No.

184
00:09:07,231 --> 00:09:08,898
But I've thought
about it.

185
00:09:08,965 --> 00:09:12,468
A lot.

186
00:09:12,519 --> 00:09:14,520
And I haven't
changed my mind.

187
00:09:17,825 --> 00:09:19,325
He thought
you were gonna die.

188
00:09:19,409 --> 00:09:23,696
Nobody knows the right way
to react in that situation.

189
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:25,364
Just give him another chance.

190
00:09:25,449 --> 00:09:27,950
He deserves it.

191
00:09:28,001 --> 00:09:30,253
I know.

192
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:36,209
But this isn't about
what he deserves.

193
00:09:36,293 --> 00:09:37,493
When things go wrong,

194
00:09:37,544 --> 00:09:40,379
I don't want to hope
that I'm not alone.

195
00:09:40,464 --> 00:09:42,048
I want to know it.

196
00:09:42,132 --> 00:09:43,816
With House...

197
00:09:45,686 --> 00:09:48,154
every time I needed him
to step up...

198
00:09:50,357 --> 00:09:52,642
he's just never
gonna be that.

199
00:09:52,693 --> 00:09:54,176
It's not his fault.
It's who he is.

200
00:09:54,228 --> 00:09:56,479
I should have known it.

201
00:09:56,530 --> 00:09:59,282
This is my fault.

202
00:10:06,373 --> 00:10:08,857
Well, he's back on Vicodin.

203
00:10:08,909 --> 00:10:11,377
So you might want to...

204
00:10:11,461 --> 00:10:14,247
keep an eye
on his new patient.

205
00:10:19,253 --> 00:10:20,219
ENG was normal.

206
00:10:20,304 --> 00:10:21,671
Means his inner ear isn't--

207
00:10:21,722 --> 00:10:22,455
<i>Morons.</i>

208
00:10:22,523 --> 00:10:23,589
It wasn't--

209
00:10:23,674 --> 00:10:24,840
<i>Whoa.</i>
<i>Wait a second.</i>

210
00:10:24,892 --> 00:10:26,225
<i>The acoustics in here</i>
<i>are beautiful.</i>

211
00:10:26,310 --> 00:10:29,345
<i>Morons!</i>

212
00:10:29,396 --> 00:10:30,930
You say it.

213
00:10:31,014 --> 00:10:32,648
Morons.

214
00:10:32,716 --> 00:10:33,933
Who was that?

215
00:10:34,017 --> 00:10:35,601
<i>Something Carnell got me.</i>

216
00:10:35,686 --> 00:10:37,103
It wasn't that ridiculous
of a theory.

217
00:10:37,187 --> 00:10:38,037
<i>Great theory.</i>

218
00:10:38,105 --> 00:10:40,022
It's a ridiculous test.

219
00:10:40,073 --> 00:10:42,408
You can't give
a standard balance test

220
00:10:42,492 --> 00:10:44,277
<i>to a champion bull rider.</i>

221
00:10:44,361 --> 00:10:45,494
<i>If you're gonna test</i>
<i>Superman's strength,</i>

222
00:10:45,562 --> 00:10:47,396
<i>you need a bigger barbell.</i>

223
00:10:47,447 --> 00:10:48,915
<i>Find one,</i>
<i>make him lift it,</i>

224
00:10:48,982 --> 00:10:51,867
then call me and tell me
how high it got.

225
00:10:51,919 --> 00:10:54,837
And tell Cuddy that spying
is for cowards.

226
00:10:58,875 --> 00:11:00,376
Just keep me posted.

227
00:11:00,427 --> 00:11:01,594
I will.
I will.

228
00:11:04,932 --> 00:11:06,966
You said my inner ear
was fine.

229
00:11:07,050 --> 00:11:08,434
Previous test
was for regular people.

230
00:11:08,518 --> 00:11:10,102
You were banged up pretty bad
in the accident.

231
00:11:10,187 --> 00:11:12,021
But given your
athletic ability...

232
00:11:12,088 --> 00:11:13,222
Wasn't no accident.

233
00:11:13,273 --> 00:11:14,357
That bull had malice
and forethought.

234
00:11:14,424 --> 00:11:17,310
Uh, you mean aforethought.

235
00:11:17,394 --> 00:11:19,261
Whatever.
He was pissed.

236
00:11:19,313 --> 00:11:20,763
Can you blame him?

237
00:11:20,831 --> 00:11:21,931
Not at all.

238
00:11:21,999 --> 00:11:23,532
If he don't do
what he gets paid for,

239
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:24,834
I don't get to do
what I get paid for.

240
00:11:24,901 --> 00:11:25,835
You ever think
of getting paid

241
00:11:25,902 --> 00:11:26,902
for doing something else?

242
00:11:26,954 --> 00:11:28,387
You're running out
of bones to break.

243
00:11:28,455 --> 00:11:30,873
You ever think of doing
something you don't love?

244
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:32,074
It has its downside,

245
00:11:32,142 --> 00:11:33,876
<i>but everything does.</i>

246
00:11:33,943 --> 00:11:37,597
There ain't nothing like
those eight seconds.

247
00:11:37,664 --> 00:11:39,114
Traveling around,
getting to meet the fans,

248
00:11:39,166 --> 00:11:41,667
that ain't so bad either,
if you know what I mean.

249
00:11:41,752 --> 00:11:44,236
All right, now what?

250
00:11:44,304 --> 00:11:45,671
<i>We're gonna start rocking</i>
<i>the platform</i>

251
00:11:45,756 --> 00:11:47,006
and changing
your visual field

252
00:11:47,090 --> 00:11:49,392
while you balance
on just your right leg.

253
00:11:49,459 --> 00:11:50,893
Here you go, Lane.

254
00:11:52,462 --> 00:11:54,313
I'm gonna start slow.

255
00:11:54,398 --> 00:11:55,731
<i>If you start to experience</i>

256
00:11:55,799 --> 00:11:57,233
any nausea
or disorientation,

257
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:58,684
just let us know
and we'll stop the test.

258
00:11:58,769 --> 00:11:59,852
You got it.

259
00:12:08,662 --> 00:12:10,780
Ha.

260
00:12:13,617 --> 00:12:15,117
That is amazing.

261
00:12:18,622 --> 00:12:19,839
We can stop.

262
00:12:19,923 --> 00:12:21,257
There's obviously
nothing wrong

263
00:12:21,324 --> 00:12:22,591
with his inner ear.

264
00:12:25,662 --> 00:12:26,995
Now what?

265
00:12:27,047 --> 00:12:30,049
And I direct that question
not to my boss,

266
00:12:30,133 --> 00:12:31,801
but to anyone
who has an answer.

267
00:12:31,852 --> 00:12:33,969
If it's not in his ear,
it's got to be his brain.

268
00:12:34,021 --> 00:12:35,271
But if we can't
get any images,

269
00:12:35,338 --> 00:12:37,440
then how do we--

270
00:12:37,507 --> 00:12:38,891
You guys
got some rusty pipes.

271
00:12:38,975 --> 00:12:41,343
This water's brown.

272
00:12:42,529 --> 00:12:44,346
That's not from the pipes.

273
00:12:44,398 --> 00:12:46,732
<i>It's from your mouth.</i>

274
00:13:00,487 --> 00:13:02,471
Can you pass me the, um...

275
00:13:07,661 --> 00:13:09,478
What took you so long?

276
00:13:09,529 --> 00:13:11,030
<i>There's nothing</i>
<i>wrong with his ears,</i>

277
00:13:11,114 --> 00:13:12,147
<i>but he's got blood</i>
<i>in his sputum.</i>

278
00:13:12,198 --> 00:13:13,866
Doesn't answer
the question.

279
00:13:13,950 --> 00:13:15,084
<i>We weren't avoiding you.</i>

280
00:13:15,151 --> 00:13:16,619
It took us a little time

281
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:18,921
to think up a diagnostic test
no one's ever thought up before.

282
00:13:18,988 --> 00:13:20,122
<i>Apology accepted.</i>

283
00:13:20,173 --> 00:13:21,823
It could be a tumor
in a salivary gland.

284
00:13:21,875 --> 00:13:23,325
We should get
a parotid biopsy.

285
00:13:23,376 --> 00:13:25,044
Oh, that's so cute.

286
00:13:25,128 --> 00:13:27,329
You're fighting over
who's in charge.

287
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:28,681
<i>GI bleed's more likely</i>

288
00:13:28,765 --> 00:13:29,965
to explain
the nausea and weakness.

289
00:13:30,016 --> 00:13:31,216
Who's in charge?

290
00:13:31,301 --> 00:13:32,834
<i>House, as long</i>
<i>as you're not here,</i>

291
00:13:32,886 --> 00:13:34,520
someone has to have the final--
<i>Let me rephrase.</i>

292
00:13:34,604 --> 00:13:35,671
Who's your daddy?

293
00:13:35,722 --> 00:13:36,555
<i>Let me rephrase.</i>

294
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:38,006
<i>You have to decide</i>

295
00:13:38,058 --> 00:13:39,058
<i>if you're gonna buck up,</i>
<i>get out of bed,</i>

296
00:13:39,142 --> 00:13:40,359
and do your job,

297
00:13:40,443 --> 00:13:41,560
or if you're gonna wallow
in self-pity.

298
00:13:41,645 --> 00:13:44,113
Those my only two choices?

299
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:47,232
Or can I also point out
the self-pity coming from you?

300
00:13:47,317 --> 00:13:49,735
<i>You're just annoyed because</i>
<i>when your relationship ended,</i>

301
00:13:49,819 --> 00:13:51,737
<i>no one gave a crap,</i>
<i>including you.</i>

302
00:13:51,821 --> 00:13:54,239
That is not true
in so many ways.

303
00:13:54,324 --> 00:13:55,958
<i>And, Chase,</i>
<i>stop screwing with Foreman.</i>

304
00:13:56,025 --> 00:13:57,493
<i>And, Foreman, no.</i>

305
00:13:57,544 --> 00:13:59,445
<i>Till the telephone</i>
<i>gets uninvented,</i>

306
00:13:59,512 --> 00:14:01,213
<i>no one in that room needs more</i>
<i>authority than I give them,</i>

307
00:14:01,297 --> 00:14:02,247
<i>and right now</i>

308
00:14:02,332 --> 00:14:03,582
I give you the authority

309
00:14:03,650 --> 00:14:05,968
to scope his GI tract
and biopsy his parotid.

310
00:14:06,035 --> 00:14:08,036
<i>And you can pick up</i>
<i>the phone.</i>

311
00:14:08,088 --> 00:14:11,090
Wait, House, should we
be more worried about you?

312
00:14:11,174 --> 00:14:12,424
Are you on Vicodin?

313
00:14:12,492 --> 00:14:13,926
Because if you are,

314
00:14:14,010 --> 00:14:16,278
<i>you probably shouldn't</i>
<i>be ordering procedures.</i>

315
00:14:20,684 --> 00:14:22,151
I am not on Vicodin.

316
00:14:22,218 --> 00:14:24,737
<i>Do the tests.</i>

317
00:14:24,821 --> 00:14:26,905
I have to see a man
about a hurdy-gurdy.

318
00:14:31,227 --> 00:14:33,395
You really think House
isn't using Vicodin?

319
00:14:33,446 --> 00:14:36,148
Does it actually worry you?

320
00:14:36,216 --> 00:14:37,449
If he's
self-prescribing meds,

321
00:14:37,517 --> 00:14:38,500
that could affect
his judgment.

322
00:14:38,568 --> 00:14:40,035
And does that worry you?

323
00:14:40,086 --> 00:14:41,737
Are you being sarcastic?

324
00:14:41,788 --> 00:14:44,423
If his rule-breaking
is affecting his judgment,

325
00:14:44,507 --> 00:14:46,141
then you can step in
and you can worry,

326
00:14:46,209 --> 00:14:48,560
but if he's just
coming up with ideas

327
00:14:48,628 --> 00:14:50,879
that we haven't thought of
but we should have,

328
00:14:50,930 --> 00:14:53,132
then our job
is to shut up and do it.

329
00:14:53,199 --> 00:14:55,584
And what do you see
in this guy?

330
00:14:55,635 --> 00:14:57,269
Hmm? What? Who?

331
00:14:59,422 --> 00:15:02,591
Oh. You think I'm attracted
to our patient?

332
00:15:02,642 --> 00:15:04,092
Right.

333
00:15:04,144 --> 00:15:05,093
It's against the rules,

334
00:15:05,145 --> 00:15:07,946
so you wouldn't do it.

335
00:15:08,031 --> 00:15:10,265
He's a macho half-wit.

336
00:15:10,316 --> 00:15:12,117
You have every reason
to not be attracted to him,

337
00:15:12,202 --> 00:15:13,736
which is why
I ask the question.

338
00:15:13,787 --> 00:15:15,904
Why are you attracted
to him?

339
00:15:15,972 --> 00:15:17,556
- Stop it.
- I'm just...

340
00:15:17,624 --> 00:15:19,158
- No, no, no. Take out the scope.
- But I don't see--

341
00:15:19,242 --> 00:15:20,292
not the monitor.
Look at his eyes.

342
00:15:25,882 --> 00:15:27,666
<i>Sclerae turned yellow.</i>
<i>Did X-rays.</i>

343
00:15:27,751 --> 00:15:29,284
<i>Looks like there's a mass</i>
<i>in his liver,</i>

344
00:15:29,335 --> 00:15:30,753
<i>but the conductive</i>
<i>metal rod in his ribs</i>

345
00:15:30,804 --> 00:15:31,670
<i>is blocking it.</i>

346
00:15:31,755 --> 00:15:33,922
Making it, as they say,

347
00:15:33,973 --> 00:15:37,426
as tough to find as a hooker
who can play the hurdy-gurdy.

348
00:15:37,477 --> 00:15:38,761
If you have a point,
can you please--

349
00:15:38,812 --> 00:15:39,845
<i>It's an expression.</i>

350
00:15:39,929 --> 00:15:42,314
Means it's tough,

351
00:15:42,398 --> 00:15:43,999
<i>but apparently</i>
<i>it can be done.</i>

352
00:15:44,067 --> 00:15:44,783
<i>If we don't have</i>
<i>any equipment...</i>

353
00:15:44,851 --> 00:15:45,768
You have eyes.

354
00:15:45,819 --> 00:15:47,519
Not that see through stuff.

355
00:15:47,604 --> 00:15:49,772
<i>Obviously.</i>

356
00:15:49,823 --> 00:15:50,739
You want us
to cut him open?

357
00:15:50,807 --> 00:15:52,274
Only if you want to see

358
00:15:52,325 --> 00:15:53,325
what's wrong with him.

359
00:15:57,330 --> 00:15:59,114
Do you know <i>Free Bird?</i>

360
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:07,539
Do you see what I see?

361
00:16:07,624 --> 00:16:09,007
No.

362
00:16:09,092 --> 00:16:10,626
Exactly.

363
00:16:12,595 --> 00:16:14,129
More suction.

364
00:16:15,965 --> 00:16:18,050
That's impossible.

365
00:16:18,134 --> 00:16:20,886
I definitely saw a mass
on the X-rays.

366
00:16:20,970 --> 00:16:22,721
It's gone now.

367
00:16:25,642 --> 00:16:29,645
It's a mass...

368
00:16:29,696 --> 00:16:31,563
and then it's not.

369
00:16:31,648 --> 00:16:33,699
You, uh,
gonna introduce us?

370
00:16:35,568 --> 00:16:38,537
Team, meet Duke.

371
00:16:38,621 --> 00:16:40,706
Anke.

372
00:16:40,790 --> 00:16:42,991
Anke?
How'd I get Duke?

373
00:16:43,059 --> 00:16:45,711
House, how many prostitutes
have you had?

374
00:16:45,795 --> 00:16:47,079
As in eaten?

375
00:16:47,163 --> 00:16:49,198
<i>Ever? This year?</i>

376
00:16:49,265 --> 00:16:51,250
Slept with.
Since you've been here.

377
00:16:51,317 --> 00:16:53,468
All but one.

378
00:16:53,536 --> 00:16:55,470
She did my taxes.

379
00:16:55,538 --> 00:16:57,156
<i>On the other hand,</i>

380
00:16:57,223 --> 00:16:59,191
tapeworm that burrowed
outside his intestinal...

381
00:16:59,259 --> 00:17:00,142
<i>We would have seen eggs</i>

382
00:17:00,209 --> 00:17:01,143
on a fecal smear

383
00:17:01,211 --> 00:17:02,794
or systemic eosinophilia.

384
00:17:02,862 --> 00:17:04,663
Detached cyst?

385
00:17:04,731 --> 00:17:05,564
<i>Couldn't migrate</i>
<i>that far</i>

386
00:17:05,632 --> 00:17:06,815
in one hour.

387
00:17:06,883 --> 00:17:08,200
We haven't been
sitting on our hands

388
00:17:08,268 --> 00:17:11,069
<i>just waiting</i>
<i>for your brilliance to kick in.</i>

389
00:17:11,137 --> 00:17:13,138
Okay,
so how did you shoot down

390
00:17:13,206 --> 00:17:15,023
intermittently swollen
lymph node?

391
00:17:19,495 --> 00:17:21,229
<i>That would mean it's</i>
<i>some kind of an infection,</i>

392
00:17:21,281 --> 00:17:23,115
which would mean we'd have to do
a spinal tap.

393
00:17:23,183 --> 00:17:24,750
But with his recent
skull fractures,

394
00:17:24,834 --> 00:17:27,002
<i>it could be</i>
<i>an increased ICP.</i>

395
00:17:27,069 --> 00:17:28,236
His brain
could herniate.

396
00:17:28,288 --> 00:17:29,621
What about
a ventricular puncture?

397
00:17:29,706 --> 00:17:31,573
Sounds good.

398
00:17:31,624 --> 00:17:35,177
You think sticking a needle
directly into his brain

399
00:17:35,244 --> 00:17:37,379
would be less dangerous
than sticking it in his spine?

400
00:17:37,430 --> 00:17:38,881
It's probably a push.

401
00:17:38,932 --> 00:17:40,415
I'm just trying
to get you out of here,

402
00:17:40,466 --> 00:17:41,950
because
underneath this sheet,

403
00:17:42,018 --> 00:17:44,553
stuff is going on.

404
00:17:44,604 --> 00:17:46,722
Just pick a spot
and stick a needle in it.

405
00:17:50,944 --> 00:17:52,561
You want to drill
through my skull

406
00:17:52,612 --> 00:17:54,813
because of a mass
that's not there?

407
00:17:54,898 --> 00:17:56,765
It was there, which means
something is wrong.

408
00:17:56,816 --> 00:17:58,567
We need to find it.

409
00:17:58,618 --> 00:18:00,602
Is there anybody
you'd like us to call?

410
00:18:00,653 --> 00:18:03,372
Someone that you'd like
to be here with you?

411
00:18:03,439 --> 00:18:05,440
Maybe a wife or girlfriend?

412
00:18:05,491 --> 00:18:07,209
<i>No, my family's</i>
<i>all back in Oklahoma,</i>

413
00:18:07,276 --> 00:18:08,744
and the guys on the circuit

414
00:18:08,795 --> 00:18:10,796
are in Calgary
at the next rodeo.

415
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:12,714
Ah, that's too bad.

416
00:18:12,782 --> 00:18:14,600
It's nice to have
somebody nearby

417
00:18:14,667 --> 00:18:17,603
you can talk to who cares.

418
00:18:20,957 --> 00:18:22,090
You okay?

419
00:18:22,141 --> 00:18:23,392
Hmm?

420
00:18:23,459 --> 00:18:26,478
You just sang, "it's good
to have somebody near by

421
00:18:26,562 --> 00:18:28,480
to talk to who cares."

422
00:18:28,564 --> 00:18:31,132
Okay, fine. I like him.
So what?

423
00:18:31,184 --> 00:18:32,734
No kidding.
I just can't figure out why.

424
00:18:32,802 --> 00:18:34,436
Yeah.

425
00:18:34,487 --> 00:18:35,320
Neither can I.

426
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:39,107
Looks clear.

427
00:18:39,158 --> 00:18:41,260
Nothing is suggesting
inflammation.

428
00:18:42,862 --> 00:18:44,079
Something's wrong.

429
00:18:44,146 --> 00:18:46,198
O-2 stats are plummeting.
We need to intubate.

430
00:18:46,282 --> 00:18:47,749
Drop the table.

431
00:18:53,373 --> 00:18:54,873
I can't get it in.

432
00:18:54,958 --> 00:18:57,175
The airway's blocked.
Get the trach kit.

433
00:19:16,229 --> 00:19:18,146
O-2 are going back up.

434
00:19:18,197 --> 00:19:19,281
What's that smell?

435
00:19:19,348 --> 00:19:21,950
Did he defecate?

436
00:19:25,354 --> 00:19:26,354
Doesn't look like it.

437
00:19:26,406 --> 00:19:28,523
I think it's his feet.

438
00:19:31,027 --> 00:19:31,910
Oh.

439
00:19:31,995 --> 00:19:34,362
Oh, man.

440
00:19:34,414 --> 00:19:36,715
Ugh.

441
00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:38,033
It's definitely
his feet.

442
00:19:39,993 --> 00:19:41,026
<i>Please don't.</i>

443
00:19:44,065 --> 00:19:46,099
That is a nice bow.

444
00:19:46,150 --> 00:19:48,468
That was a nice door.

445
00:19:48,519 --> 00:19:49,769
Put it on my tab.

446
00:19:50,971 --> 00:19:54,157
Let's say we
take it up a notch.

447
00:19:54,241 --> 00:19:55,575
Yeah, right.
Very funny.

448
00:19:55,642 --> 00:19:57,160
You don't trust me?

449
00:19:57,244 --> 00:19:58,278
No.

450
00:19:58,329 --> 00:19:59,913
I'll do it.

451
00:20:02,149 --> 00:20:03,867
And we have a gamer.

452
00:20:03,951 --> 00:20:05,535
<i>Oh, come on, man.</i>

453
00:20:05,619 --> 00:20:06,786
You can't be serious.

454
00:20:06,837 --> 00:20:08,121
Why not?

455
00:20:08,172 --> 00:20:10,090
Anything goes wrong,
we just take her to the doctor.

456
00:20:10,157 --> 00:20:12,542
And I'm only
eight paces away.

457
00:20:12,626 --> 00:20:13,993
- House--
- I like you, Carnell.

458
00:20:14,045 --> 00:20:16,046
Don't ruin it.

459
00:20:16,130 --> 00:20:19,999
Stinky feet can point
to diabetes,

460
00:20:20,051 --> 00:20:22,769
<i>athlete's foot,</i>
<i>or gangrene--pick one.</i>

461
00:20:22,837 --> 00:20:23,720
<i>No!</i>

462
00:20:23,804 --> 00:20:25,271
Uh, none.

463
00:20:25,339 --> 00:20:27,006
None of those
cause bloody sputum

464
00:20:27,058 --> 00:20:28,674
or disappearing masses.

465
00:20:28,726 --> 00:20:30,343
No. No. No. No.

466
00:20:30,394 --> 00:20:32,011
<i>You're gonna kill her.</i>

467
00:20:32,063 --> 00:20:33,696
<i>Don't do that, Carnell.</i>

468
00:20:33,781 --> 00:20:36,032
<i>They might get the idea</i>
<i>that I'm shooting at a hooker.</i>

469
00:20:40,788 --> 00:20:44,541
Fungal infection can cause
ulceration between the toes

470
00:20:44,625 --> 00:20:47,077
<i>and bleeding could be</i>
<i>from recurring abscesses</i>

471
00:20:47,144 --> 00:20:49,045
<i>that appear to be</i>
<i>recurring masses.</i>

472
00:20:49,130 --> 00:20:50,863
Symptoms in the head or feet

473
00:20:50,915 --> 00:20:51,998
<i>mean the infection</i>
<i>would have to be</i>

474
00:20:52,049 --> 00:20:53,633
<i>in the heart</i>
<i>or the brain.</i>

475
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:55,168
<i>I say we start by looking</i>
<i>in the heart,</i>

476
00:20:55,219 --> 00:20:56,669
<i>because looking</i>
<i>at his brain</i>

477
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:58,004
with a metal plate
is problematic.

478
00:20:58,055 --> 00:20:59,756
So's MRI'ing his heart.

479
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:02,092
He's got a seven-centimeter
conductive metal rod

480
00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:04,144
<i>holding his rib together.</i>
<i>It'll rip him in two.</i>

481
00:21:04,211 --> 00:21:06,513
No, it'll just feel like
it's ripping him in two,

482
00:21:06,564 --> 00:21:08,231
which is much better.

483
00:21:08,299 --> 00:21:09,649
<i>We could minimize the damage</i>

484
00:21:09,716 --> 00:21:11,884
by injecting ice water
into his abdominal cavity.

485
00:21:11,936 --> 00:21:14,070
<i>No. Please, no.</i>

486
00:21:22,696 --> 00:21:24,447
Oh, God!

487
00:21:24,532 --> 00:21:25,949
Oops.

488
00:21:26,033 --> 00:21:29,119
<i>Got to go.</i>

489
00:21:29,203 --> 00:21:30,170
Call an ambulance!

490
00:21:30,237 --> 00:21:31,204
Why?

491
00:21:31,255 --> 00:21:32,572
What do you mean why?

492
00:21:32,623 --> 00:21:33,573
She's hurt!

493
00:21:33,624 --> 00:21:35,408
She doesn't look hurt.

494
00:21:40,931 --> 00:21:42,081
No, you didn't.

495
00:21:42,133 --> 00:21:43,716
<i>Yes, we did.</i>

496
00:21:48,806 --> 00:21:50,857
You're an ass.

497
00:21:50,924 --> 00:21:54,561
Okay. Go get me, uh,
General Patton's Colt 45.

498
00:21:54,612 --> 00:21:56,262
<i>The one</i>
<i>with the two notches.</i>

499
00:21:56,313 --> 00:21:57,614
He's not
getting you a gun.

500
00:21:59,733 --> 00:22:02,368
Your friend knows
how to have a good time.

501
00:22:06,957 --> 00:22:09,125
<i>The MRI magnets are gonna</i>
<i>heat the metal.</i>

502
00:22:09,210 --> 00:22:10,076
<i>Could get</i>
<i>to over 300 degrees</i>

503
00:22:10,127 --> 00:22:11,578
in 15 seconds.

504
00:22:11,629 --> 00:22:13,913
Which is why
we're injecting ice water

505
00:22:13,964 --> 00:22:16,499
into your abdominal cavity.

506
00:22:16,584 --> 00:22:18,468
You'll feel colder
than you've ever felt,

507
00:22:18,536 --> 00:22:21,304
and then you'll be hotter--

508
00:22:21,388 --> 00:22:24,474
um, you'll <i>feel</i> hotter
than you've ever felt.

509
00:22:28,596 --> 00:22:29,729
We'll try to be
as quick as possible.

510
00:22:31,265 --> 00:22:32,632
Wow.

511
00:22:32,683 --> 00:22:34,400
Shut up.

512
00:22:43,110 --> 00:22:44,027
It's interesting.

513
00:22:44,111 --> 00:22:45,495
No, it's not.

514
00:22:45,579 --> 00:22:47,830
It's mundane and simple.

515
00:22:47,915 --> 00:22:51,584
He's obviously
a very blessed specimen,

516
00:22:51,652 --> 00:22:53,486
so from an evolutionary
point of view,

517
00:22:53,537 --> 00:22:55,321
he'd produce
healthy offspring,

518
00:22:55,372 --> 00:22:57,590
so my prefrontal cortex
is telling me

519
00:22:57,658 --> 00:22:59,425
I should have sex with him.

520
00:22:59,493 --> 00:23:01,827
- Oh. Is that all?
- Yes.

521
00:23:01,879 --> 00:23:04,297
My rational brain knows
he's a hillbilly and an idiot.

522
00:23:04,348 --> 00:23:06,182
<i>And yet somehow</i>
<i>your rational brain</i>

523
00:23:06,267 --> 00:23:08,518
is losing the argument,
which is interesting.

524
00:23:10,771 --> 00:23:11,971
You were bored.

525
00:23:12,022 --> 00:23:14,107
You must have spent
about two days

526
00:23:14,174 --> 00:23:17,110
setting up a fake murder,
and you were bored.

527
00:23:17,177 --> 00:23:19,245
I'm fine.

528
00:23:19,313 --> 00:23:20,846
You're not.

529
00:23:20,898 --> 00:23:24,984
And I'm worried you might
do something even stupider.

530
00:23:25,035 --> 00:23:26,786
Why don't you move back in
with me?

531
00:23:26,853 --> 00:23:28,688
At least until
you get back on track.

532
00:23:28,739 --> 00:23:31,357
What an ego.

533
00:23:31,408 --> 00:23:33,793
You think you're some sort
of emotional paragon?

534
00:23:33,860 --> 00:23:34,877
You're my rock?

535
00:23:34,945 --> 00:23:36,195
I'm trying
to be a friend.

536
00:23:36,247 --> 00:23:37,547
At least I have
the good sense

537
00:23:37,631 --> 00:23:40,866
not to marry every woman
I fall into bed with.

538
00:23:40,918 --> 00:23:42,635
Maybe you should move in
with me.

539
00:23:42,703 --> 00:23:44,804
Either way.
If you prefer...

540
00:23:44,871 --> 00:23:46,339
I prefer you to stop talking
about this.

541
00:23:46,390 --> 00:23:48,091
House, we haven't even started
talking about this

542
00:23:48,175 --> 00:23:50,393
except to establish the fact
that you are fine,

543
00:23:50,477 --> 00:23:51,377
which clearly you aren't.

544
00:23:51,428 --> 00:23:53,313
Leave me alone!

545
00:23:57,434 --> 00:23:58,884
No.

546
00:23:58,936 --> 00:24:00,737
We are gonna
talk about this,

547
00:24:00,821 --> 00:24:03,072
and we're gonna
deal with this.

548
00:24:05,943 --> 00:24:06,993
So I have no choice?

549
00:24:08,612 --> 00:24:10,830
Fine.

550
00:24:10,898 --> 00:24:13,065
Unless...

551
00:24:13,117 --> 00:24:16,452
Unless...yes, I do.

552
00:24:16,537 --> 00:24:18,171
I do have legs.

553
00:24:20,507 --> 00:24:22,925
I see you didn't factor those
into your brilliant plan.

554
00:24:34,138 --> 00:24:35,438
Lane, can you
try to hold still?

555
00:24:35,522 --> 00:24:37,223
I'm trying.

556
00:24:37,274 --> 00:24:38,941
Real hard.

557
00:24:40,894 --> 00:24:44,764
Guy is tough.
I'll give him that.

558
00:24:44,815 --> 00:24:47,099
My prefrontal cortex
is a little aroused.

559
00:24:47,151 --> 00:24:48,701
Just get
the damn picture.

560
00:24:48,769 --> 00:24:49,836
Rib temp is at 158.

561
00:24:52,656 --> 00:24:54,707
I don't have a clear view
of his aorta yet.

562
00:24:54,775 --> 00:24:56,108
This isn't gonna work.
We have to stop.

563
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:57,293
No. You're trying
to protect him

564
00:24:57,378 --> 00:24:59,295
instead of trying
to save him.

565
00:24:59,380 --> 00:25:00,913
He's smoking.

566
00:25:00,964 --> 00:25:02,382
Literally, you ass.

567
00:25:02,449 --> 00:25:03,966
Five more seconds.

568
00:25:04,051 --> 00:25:04,967
No, getting a good image

569
00:25:05,052 --> 00:25:06,085
isn't gonna mean anything

570
00:25:06,136 --> 00:25:07,070
if he doesn't have
a rib cage.

571
00:25:09,223 --> 00:25:11,290
Got it.

572
00:25:24,071 --> 00:25:25,021
Whew.

573
00:25:25,105 --> 00:25:29,776
The images,
they're normal.

574
00:25:29,827 --> 00:25:31,277
<i>Whew.</i>

575
00:25:34,314 --> 00:25:36,749
<i>Ah. Whew.</i>

576
00:25:47,678 --> 00:25:50,580
You're gonna have to talk
to him eventually.

577
00:25:52,633 --> 00:25:53,533
He needs you.

578
00:25:57,638 --> 00:25:59,105
I love him.

579
00:25:59,172 --> 00:26:02,341
And I know he loves me.

580
00:26:02,409 --> 00:26:03,476
But I just can't...

581
00:26:03,527 --> 00:26:05,812
He needs you in his life.

582
00:26:05,863 --> 00:26:09,181
Even if you're not sleeping
with him, he needs you.

583
00:26:10,868 --> 00:26:11,851
Without you--

584
00:26:11,902 --> 00:26:14,187
You can't go backwards.

585
00:26:17,958 --> 00:26:20,660
I can't fix his problem.

586
00:26:23,414 --> 00:26:26,065
I <i>am</i> his problem.

587
00:26:36,804 --> 00:26:39,189
If the infection's
not in his heart,

588
00:26:39,273 --> 00:26:41,358
then it's in his brain.

589
00:26:41,442 --> 00:26:43,076
You're in my sun.

590
00:26:43,144 --> 00:26:44,811
Do a CT.
We can't.

591
00:26:44,862 --> 00:26:45,946
He has a titanium plate

592
00:26:46,013 --> 00:26:46,847
and a bunch
of metal screws.

593
00:26:46,914 --> 00:26:48,165
Get rid of them.

594
00:26:48,249 --> 00:26:50,333
His skull has multiple
hairline fractures.

595
00:26:50,418 --> 00:26:51,334
<i>Removing the metal plate</i>

596
00:26:51,419 --> 00:26:52,586
<i>will be like removing</i>

597
00:26:52,653 --> 00:26:54,621
half an eggshell
without cracking

598
00:26:54,672 --> 00:26:55,622
<i>the rest of the shell.</i>

599
00:26:55,673 --> 00:26:57,040
And not removing the plate

600
00:26:57,124 --> 00:26:58,425
will be like leaving
the egg out to rot.

601
00:26:58,492 --> 00:27:00,243
We can't cut off
the top of his head

602
00:27:00,311 --> 00:27:01,862
based on a few symptoms
that disappear

603
00:27:01,929 --> 00:27:03,513
<i>whenever we try</i>
<i>to test for them.</i>

604
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:10,187
What if the one symptom
that hasn't disappeared

605
00:27:10,271 --> 00:27:12,472
was never actually there?

606
00:27:12,523 --> 00:27:14,774
Any delays
when he answers questions?

607
00:27:16,644 --> 00:27:19,462
He doesn't have
partial hearing loss.

608
00:27:19,530 --> 00:27:21,698
He's missing moments.

609
00:27:21,782 --> 00:27:23,099
<i>He reported having something</i>

610
00:27:23,167 --> 00:27:26,152
like a complex partial seizure
during a bull ride.

611
00:27:26,204 --> 00:27:28,154
Said it hasn't happened since,
but what if he's wrong?

612
00:27:28,206 --> 00:27:29,789
What if the infection
in the brain

613
00:27:29,857 --> 00:27:31,291
is causing it
to happen all the time?

614
00:27:31,359 --> 00:27:33,894
His E.E.G. didn't show any sign
of seizure activity.

615
00:27:33,961 --> 00:27:35,045
I didn't say it was a seizure.

616
00:27:35,129 --> 00:27:36,496
I said it was something
like a seizure.

617
00:27:36,547 --> 00:27:38,048
And I'm guessing
you're about to tell us

618
00:27:38,132 --> 00:27:40,083
we need to find something
like an E.E.G. to prove--

619
00:27:40,167 --> 00:27:41,885
Nope,
'cause I already got one.

620
00:27:45,056 --> 00:27:46,840
You want me to sing?

621
00:27:46,891 --> 00:27:48,925
How's singing <i>My Bonnie</i> gonna
help you see inside my brain?

622
00:27:49,010 --> 00:27:50,093
<i>It won't.</i>

623
00:27:50,177 --> 00:27:51,478
It's just gonna prove
that we need

624
00:27:51,545 --> 00:27:53,430
to cut into your skull,

625
00:27:53,514 --> 00:27:55,232
which is gonna
be kind of dangerous.

626
00:27:55,316 --> 00:27:57,734
So you've got a real incentive
to sing like an angel.

627
00:27:57,818 --> 00:27:59,218
We think you're having
mini blackouts,

628
00:27:59,270 --> 00:28:00,904
but your brain compensates.

629
00:28:00,988 --> 00:28:04,608
<i>But it can't compensate</i>
<i>if there's a preset rhythm.</i>

630
00:28:07,245 --> 00:28:09,663
One, two, three.

631
00:28:09,730 --> 00:28:13,533
? My Bonnie
lies over the ocean ?

632
00:28:13,584 --> 00:28:16,235
? my Bonnie lies... ?

633
00:28:16,287 --> 00:28:18,455
? ...over the sea ?

634
00:28:18,539 --> 00:28:22,509
? my Bonnie...
Lies over the ocean ?

635
00:28:22,576 --> 00:28:26,346
? oh, bring back
my Bonnie to me ?

636
00:28:26,413 --> 00:28:27,797
See? Told ya.

637
00:28:29,717 --> 00:28:30,967
Lane,
that wasn't even close.

638
00:28:34,605 --> 00:28:37,557
That was brilliant.

639
00:28:37,608 --> 00:28:40,644
Yeah.

640
00:28:56,827 --> 00:28:59,663
It's understandable.

641
00:29:02,116 --> 00:29:04,250
I hate
when you do that.

642
00:29:04,302 --> 00:29:06,836
You respond to what you think
I'm thinking,

643
00:29:06,921 --> 00:29:09,639
because you think
that I think like you do.

644
00:29:09,724 --> 00:29:10,974
It's insulting
and annoying.

645
00:29:13,594 --> 00:29:15,645
You're scared because
nothing excites you.

646
00:29:15,713 --> 00:29:17,914
Fun doesn't excite you.

647
00:29:17,982 --> 00:29:19,599
Puzzles don't excite you.

648
00:29:19,650 --> 00:29:21,735
What's left?

649
00:29:21,802 --> 00:29:24,087
And I was saying
you're right.

650
00:29:27,441 --> 00:29:29,192
You're upset.
You're depressed.

651
00:29:29,276 --> 00:29:31,194
Everything's gonna taste
a little worse right now,

652
00:29:31,262 --> 00:29:33,313
but it'll pass.

653
00:29:36,167 --> 00:29:38,251
It's understandable.

654
00:29:38,318 --> 00:29:40,620
You're scared because
you think I'm falling apart,

655
00:29:40,688 --> 00:29:42,622
and you're trying
to convince yourself

656
00:29:42,673 --> 00:29:44,674
that you're overreacting.

657
00:29:47,178 --> 00:29:48,511
Keeps ringing.

658
00:29:49,930 --> 00:29:51,164
Yeah.

659
00:29:51,215 --> 00:29:53,166
House, there's no infection
in this guy's brain.

660
00:29:53,217 --> 00:29:54,634
CT's clean.

661
00:29:54,685 --> 00:29:57,220
Well, that sucks.

662
00:29:57,304 --> 00:30:00,857
Now we have
to blow up his heart.

663
00:30:03,644 --> 00:30:04,811
We're not
blowing up his heart,

664
00:30:04,862 --> 00:30:06,229
because we've
ruled out his heart.

665
00:30:06,313 --> 00:30:08,481
MRI and transesophageal echo
reveal no swelling,

666
00:30:08,532 --> 00:30:09,682
no masses, no vegetation,

667
00:30:09,734 --> 00:30:10,817
no sign of anything.

668
00:30:14,472 --> 00:30:16,873
'Cause we're looking
the wrong way.

669
00:30:16,957 --> 00:30:18,925
There's an imperfection.

670
00:30:18,993 --> 00:30:20,944
How do you find where?

671
00:30:21,012 --> 00:30:23,196
I don't know.
Get a magnifying glass and--

672
00:30:23,247 --> 00:30:25,215
You suck.

673
00:30:25,299 --> 00:30:28,718
Feel free to interpret
that both ways.

674
00:30:28,803 --> 00:30:29,886
Suck on the straw,

675
00:30:29,970 --> 00:30:31,054
see where the drink leaks.

676
00:30:31,138 --> 00:30:32,806
You're saying we put
pressure on his aorta

677
00:30:32,873 --> 00:30:34,257
until it rips open?

678
00:30:34,341 --> 00:30:36,359
You do realize
the downside of that?

679
00:30:36,427 --> 00:30:38,344
<i>If we don't rip it,</i>

680
00:30:38,396 --> 00:30:39,879
the damage
from the infection will,

681
00:30:39,930 --> 00:30:42,098
probably not when he's got
his chest open in an O.R.

682
00:30:42,183 --> 00:30:44,651
Where it can be repaired
inside the 60 seconds

683
00:30:44,718 --> 00:30:45,985
it'll take him
to bleed to death.

684
00:30:46,053 --> 00:30:47,020
<i>It's a ridiculous idea.</i>

685
00:30:47,071 --> 00:30:48,238
It won't work.

686
00:30:48,322 --> 00:30:49,773
Now if you don't mind...

687
00:30:49,857 --> 00:30:51,941
get this guy's approval
to rip his heart open.

688
00:31:03,184 --> 00:31:05,902
Hey.

689
00:31:05,987 --> 00:31:09,356
We think you have
a bartonella infection,

690
00:31:09,407 --> 00:31:12,492
which caused a mycotic aneurysm
in your aortic wall.

691
00:31:12,543 --> 00:31:14,328
We need to find it,

692
00:31:14,379 --> 00:31:17,214
which means we need
to blow up your heart.

693
00:31:17,298 --> 00:31:19,916
And, yes, I'm as serious
as a heart attack.

694
00:31:19,984 --> 00:31:22,169
We're going to increase
your blood pressure

695
00:31:22,220 --> 00:31:25,389
until the weak spot
in your aortic wall explodes.

696
00:31:25,473 --> 00:31:26,840
Hopefully we'll
be able to fix it

697
00:31:26,891 --> 00:31:28,508
before you bleed to death.

698
00:31:28,559 --> 00:31:32,813
Any questions?

699
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:34,364
Nope.

700
00:31:35,516 --> 00:31:36,984
Really?

701
00:31:37,051 --> 00:31:38,402
You don't even want to know

702
00:31:38,469 --> 00:31:40,537
if you'll be able to go
back to bull riding?

703
00:31:40,605 --> 00:31:41,938
I assume no?

704
00:31:42,023 --> 00:31:44,157
I mean, you've already
cracked open my skull,

705
00:31:44,225 --> 00:31:48,161
and now you're gonna
blow up my heart.

706
00:31:48,229 --> 00:31:50,614
Thought you loved
those eight seconds.

707
00:31:57,372 --> 00:32:00,424
I do.

708
00:32:00,508 --> 00:32:04,494
And now you're telling me
that I got to give them up.

709
00:32:07,999 --> 00:32:10,233
<i>I can always find</i>
<i>something else to love.</i>

710
00:32:16,007 --> 00:32:18,591
<i>House.</i>

711
00:32:18,643 --> 00:32:21,611
We need to talk.

712
00:32:32,123 --> 00:32:33,790
You didn't expect me
to say yes

713
00:32:33,875 --> 00:32:35,542
to rupturing his aorta,
did you?

714
00:32:35,609 --> 00:32:37,294
Since I didn't ask,

715
00:32:37,378 --> 00:32:39,779
I wasn't expecting you
to say anything at all.

716
00:32:39,831 --> 00:32:42,265
You have no reason to believe
this will save his life.

717
00:32:42,333 --> 00:32:44,134
Really?

718
00:32:44,218 --> 00:32:45,736
No reason? None at all?

719
00:32:45,803 --> 00:32:47,637
I'm just planning on
cracking open his chest,

720
00:32:47,722 --> 00:32:50,557
blowing up his heart,
what, to pad his bill?

721
00:32:50,624 --> 00:32:52,259
Or you think that since
you broke my heart

722
00:32:52,310 --> 00:32:55,962
I want to break his.

723
00:32:56,013 --> 00:32:57,564
I don't know.

724
00:32:57,631 --> 00:33:00,434
I think maybe you're
looking for something

725
00:33:00,501 --> 00:33:03,570
that can excite you.

726
00:33:03,638 --> 00:33:05,989
Fill a void.

727
00:33:06,057 --> 00:33:09,476
And it's affecting
your judgment.

728
00:33:09,527 --> 00:33:12,028
You're right.
I am.

729
00:33:12,113 --> 00:33:14,981
My damaged, depressed,
drug-addled judgment

730
00:33:15,032 --> 00:33:16,149
is still better than yours

731
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:17,667
or any other doctor
in this hospital,

732
00:33:17,752 --> 00:33:20,837
and my team is gonna do this
procedure and save his life.

733
00:33:20,922 --> 00:33:23,373
So you can either have security
arrest me and my team,

734
00:33:23,458 --> 00:33:28,295
or you can get
the hell out of my way.

735
00:33:28,346 --> 00:33:29,713
And she caves.

736
00:33:42,226 --> 00:33:43,110
<i>Rib spreader in place.</i>

737
00:33:43,177 --> 00:33:44,311
Heart looks good.

738
00:33:44,362 --> 00:33:47,180
The aorta's exposed.

739
00:33:54,989 --> 00:33:57,624
I take it you
ratted me out to Cuddy.

740
00:33:57,691 --> 00:34:02,996
I think your judgment
is compromised.

741
00:34:03,047 --> 00:34:05,048
No, you don't.

742
00:34:05,133 --> 00:34:06,333
Come on.

743
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:07,534
I got a squash game at 2:00.

744
00:34:07,585 --> 00:34:09,202
Let's give this cowboy a ride.

745
00:34:09,253 --> 00:34:10,370
<i>If I inject more,</i>

746
00:34:10,421 --> 00:34:11,555
there won't be any room
for the blood

747
00:34:11,639 --> 00:34:12,339
to go through
the rest of his body.

748
00:34:12,390 --> 00:34:15,041
You're right.

749
00:34:15,092 --> 00:34:17,093
Let's make damn sure
we don't damage his toes

750
00:34:17,161 --> 00:34:18,178
while we blow up
his heart.

751
00:34:31,275 --> 00:34:32,725
No bubbles,
no bruising, no gaps.

752
00:34:32,777 --> 00:34:35,278
It's not working.

753
00:34:35,363 --> 00:34:37,581
Yes, it is.

754
00:34:41,819 --> 00:34:44,521
I was wrong.

755
00:34:44,589 --> 00:34:46,456
Not yet.

756
00:34:46,541 --> 00:34:47,791
Let's switch him over to
bypass for the debridement.

757
00:34:47,875 --> 00:34:49,125
Come on.
We don't have much time.

758
00:34:49,210 --> 00:34:51,211
Slow the heart down
so it doesn't--

759
00:34:51,262 --> 00:34:52,679
<i>Damn.</i>

760
00:34:52,746 --> 00:34:53,847
<i>Clamp.</i>

761
00:34:53,914 --> 00:34:55,382
We can't clamp the aorta
at this pressure.

762
00:34:55,433 --> 00:34:56,416
Even if you can see
through all the blood.

763
00:34:56,467 --> 00:34:57,517
Do it anyway.

764
00:34:57,585 --> 00:34:59,386
We need suction
and more sponges.

765
00:35:01,088 --> 00:35:02,222
Leak is too fast.

766
00:35:02,273 --> 00:35:04,757
No, it's not.
We can fix this.

767
00:35:31,502 --> 00:35:33,503
It worked.

768
00:35:37,425 --> 00:35:38,458
House, it worked.

769
00:35:40,928 --> 00:35:42,596
I heard you.

770
00:36:16,866 --> 00:36:18,366
Hey.

771
00:36:18,434 --> 00:36:21,119
I'm awake,
so I guess it worked.

772
00:36:21,204 --> 00:36:25,824
As long as you don't get
your heart rate too high.

773
00:36:25,908 --> 00:36:29,377
You, uh, probably shouldn't
have sex for a while.

774
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:31,963
I'll keep that in mind.

775
00:36:35,468 --> 00:36:38,153
Want to hang out,
see your ranch sometime?

776
00:36:38,221 --> 00:36:41,489
Uh...

777
00:36:47,129 --> 00:36:49,414
That would probably
be inappropriate,

778
00:36:49,482 --> 00:36:52,984
'cause I'm your doctor
and everything.

779
00:36:57,273 --> 00:37:00,825
Good luck with everything.

780
00:37:10,453 --> 00:37:12,203
I--

781
00:37:18,494 --> 00:37:20,762
Double scotch.
Doubled.

782
00:37:20,829 --> 00:37:22,547
Uh, blended? Single malt?
Any preference?

783
00:37:22,632 --> 00:37:24,633
No.

784
00:37:30,022 --> 00:37:31,356
Yeah,
sorry about the noise.

785
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:33,224
I guess, uh,
their team won.

786
00:37:34,944 --> 00:37:36,611
Although I got
to tell you,

787
00:37:36,679 --> 00:37:39,114
sometimes I wish I could still
act like that, you know?

788
00:37:39,181 --> 00:37:40,198
Just let loose.

789
00:37:46,572 --> 00:37:48,039
Ah, I guess it's
a little easier, though,

790
00:37:48,107 --> 00:37:49,124
when you got no troubles.

791
00:37:49,191 --> 00:37:51,376
Parents still
paying your bills.

792
00:37:51,460 --> 00:37:54,245
<i>Got your whole life</i>
<i>ahead of you.</i>

793
00:38:40,376 --> 00:38:48,133
? ?

794
00:38:59,779 --> 00:39:04,366
? my body is a cage ?

795
00:39:04,433 --> 00:39:10,488

796
00:39:10,573 --> 00:39:13,941

? of fear and self-doubt ?

802
00:39:46,275 --> 00:39:49,077
? it's a hollow play ?

803
00:39:49,144 --> 00:39:52,747
? but they'll clap anyway ?

804
00:39:59,655 --> 00:40:03,875
