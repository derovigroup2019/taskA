1
00:00:43,153 --> 00:00:44,654
Hey, sweetie.

2
00:00:44,722 --> 00:00:46,222
Yeah, I'm sorry.

3
00:00:46,290 --> 00:00:48,291
No, the meeting's
running a little late.

4
00:00:48,358 --> 00:00:49,726
Well, you know Matheson...

5
00:00:49,793 --> 00:00:52,895
the guy loves
to hear himself talk.

6
00:00:52,963 --> 00:00:57,266
Yeah. Yeah.
I'll meet you at the restaurant.

7
00:00:57,334 --> 00:00:58,901
Hey, we're going over
the contracts now.

8
00:00:58,969 --> 00:01:00,236
I gotta get back in there.

9
00:01:00,304 --> 00:01:02,672
I love you too.

10
00:01:13,951 --> 00:01:14,884
You're getting paid to clean,

11
00:01:14,952 --> 00:01:16,753
not window shop, Vesky.

12
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:18,621
You calling me a thief?

13
00:01:18,689 --> 00:01:20,823
Take it easy.
Just yanking your chain.

14
00:01:20,891 --> 00:01:22,759
Damn, it's freezin' in here.

15
00:01:22,826 --> 00:01:24,360
<i>Better the cold
than the smell.</i>

16
00:01:24,428 --> 00:01:26,763
Used to think my job sucked.

17
00:01:26,830 --> 00:01:28,698
How much you make an hour anyway?
Not enough.

18
00:01:28,766 --> 00:01:29,899
The difference is that this job

19
00:01:29,967 --> 00:01:31,501
is just a temporary setback.

20
00:01:31,568 --> 00:01:34,837
You, on the other hand,
will always be a schmuck.

21
00:01:34,905 --> 00:01:37,273
Yeah. Schmuck with a guaranteed
pension and benefits.

22
00:01:37,341 --> 00:01:39,575
I'll take it.

23
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:58,194
I'm sorry I'm late.

24
00:02:00,664 --> 00:02:02,732
No talking about
real estate tonight.

25
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:04,600
I really want you
to just enjoy yourself.

26
00:02:04,668 --> 00:02:05,935
Well, seeing you in that dress,

27
00:02:06,003 --> 00:02:07,136
I'd say mission accomplished.

28
00:02:07,204 --> 00:02:08,471
Gets a little better.

29
00:02:08,539 --> 00:02:10,740
Wait till you see
what's on underneath.

30
00:02:10,808 --> 00:02:12,508
Fresh tako with lemon.
Enjoy.

31
00:02:12,576 --> 00:02:15,278
I...Ordered
the appetizer special.

32
00:02:15,345 --> 00:02:17,880
Oh, I thought tako
was a kind of tuna.

33
00:02:17,948 --> 00:02:19,549
Ooh. We're so not
eating this.

34
00:02:19,616 --> 00:02:21,417
Well, we should
at least try it.

35
00:02:21,485 --> 00:02:23,152
Please, it's moving, Bert.

36
00:02:26,557 --> 00:02:28,524
<i>Oh, it's so gross!</i>

37
00:02:28,592 --> 00:02:30,560
Actually, it's...
Not that bad.

38
00:02:30,627 --> 00:02:31,661
<i>Really?</i>

39
00:02:31,728 --> 00:02:32,862
I'm not eating it.

40
00:02:37,901 --> 00:02:39,836
To us...

41
00:02:39,903 --> 00:02:41,671
On our third anniversary.

42
00:02:41,738 --> 00:02:45,474
The day I met you was...

43
00:02:45,542 --> 00:02:47,743
was...

44
00:02:49,279 --> 00:02:51,247
<i>Bert?</i>

45
00:02:51,315 --> 00:02:54,617
Bert. What is it?
What...

46
00:02:54,685 --> 00:02:56,819
honey, what's wrong?

47
00:02:57,955 --> 00:02:59,522
Someone, please call 911!

48
00:03:01,692 --> 00:03:02,758
Honey.

49
00:03:02,826 --> 00:03:03,826
Honey...

50
00:03:26,662 --> 00:03:30,867
Sync by n17t01
www.addic7ed.com

51
00:03:48,505 --> 00:03:50,873
House.

52
00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:23,072
I assume you're avoiding me
because of the charity gala.

53
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:24,140
This Friday?

54
00:04:24,207 --> 00:04:26,042
It's completely
slipped my mind.

55
00:04:26,109 --> 00:04:27,543
<i>So you'll be there?
No, I meant</i>

56
00:04:27,611 --> 00:04:29,211
it slipped my mind
to tell you I'm not going.

57
00:04:29,279 --> 00:04:30,680
What do you think
it'll look like

58
00:04:30,747 --> 00:04:32,181
if you don't show up
when I get an award?

59
00:04:32,249 --> 00:04:34,216
Like I don't give a crap
about awards, charities,

60
00:04:34,284 --> 00:04:35,985
what it looks like.

61
00:04:36,053 --> 00:04:37,586
If you ever want...

62
00:04:37,654 --> 00:04:39,188
I RSVPed two days ago.

63
00:04:39,256 --> 00:04:41,257
What, you think
I'm a complete ass?

64
00:04:46,430 --> 00:04:48,331
If you were already going,
why did you...

65
00:04:48,398 --> 00:04:50,533
foreplay.

66
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:59,141
What?

67
00:04:59,209 --> 00:05:00,476
Are you wearing my tie?

68
00:05:00,544 --> 00:05:01,711
Oh, I saw it in your closet,

69
00:05:01,778 --> 00:05:03,379
and it happened
to match my shirt.

70
00:05:03,447 --> 00:05:04,747
Why were you in my closet?

71
00:05:04,815 --> 00:05:06,415
Looking for a tie.
What's the big deal?

72
00:05:06,483 --> 00:05:09,251
Obviously, he wants you out
of the closet for some reason.

73
00:05:09,319 --> 00:05:11,454
I suspect marriage,
but I'm liberal that way.

74
00:05:11,521 --> 00:05:14,457
Now, tell me how someone
can have an allergic reaction

75
00:05:14,524 --> 00:05:17,126
when all their tests were
negative for known allergens.

76
00:05:17,194 --> 00:05:18,394
Environmental.

77
00:05:18,462 --> 00:05:20,529
File says he's
a real estate developer.

78
00:05:20,597 --> 00:05:22,098
Could have been exposed
to something

79
00:05:22,165 --> 00:05:23,332
visiting a construction site.

80
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:25,568
He's lying.

81
00:05:27,070 --> 00:05:28,471
He's not an executive.
I saw his hands.

82
00:05:28,538 --> 00:05:30,072
<i>They're covered with calluses
and little cuts.</i>

83
00:05:30,140 --> 00:05:31,707
<i>He works with them.</i>

84
00:05:31,775 --> 00:05:33,809
A lot.

85
00:05:33,877 --> 00:05:35,111
Stand up.

86
00:05:43,186 --> 00:05:45,388
Our little girl...
Is finally growing up.

87
00:05:45,455 --> 00:05:47,523
I mean, you dream of this day,

88
00:05:47,591 --> 00:05:49,258
but when it finally happens...

89
00:05:51,028 --> 00:05:52,762
So what did
Mr. meat hooks say

90
00:05:52,829 --> 00:05:54,930
when you called him a liar?

91
00:05:57,300 --> 00:05:58,467
I didn't.

92
00:05:59,803 --> 00:06:02,405
Hmm. Baby steps.

93
00:06:02,472 --> 00:06:04,740
Go down there and do it.

94
00:06:07,010 --> 00:06:08,544
But what if I'm wrong?

95
00:06:08,612 --> 00:06:09,745
I'll just end up offending him.

96
00:06:09,813 --> 00:06:11,847
Consider that part a bonus.

97
00:06:14,284 --> 00:06:16,052
All right, I'll send along

98
00:06:16,119 --> 00:06:17,720
one of your big brothers
to help.

99
00:06:17,788 --> 00:06:19,688
<i>You want scary, smarmy,
or shorty?</i>

100
00:06:24,561 --> 00:06:27,096
We need to ask you
a few questions.

101
00:06:27,164 --> 00:06:29,665
Alone.
If you don't mind.

102
00:06:33,170 --> 00:06:36,072
Uh, they tend to be
personal in nature.

103
00:06:36,139 --> 00:06:37,473
I'm his wife.

104
00:06:37,541 --> 00:06:41,210
I can probably answer them
better than he can.

105
00:06:41,278 --> 00:06:43,212
They're about his job.

106
00:06:44,815 --> 00:06:46,515
Well, what does that matter?

107
00:06:46,583 --> 00:06:48,551
He sits in an office all day...

108
00:06:48,618 --> 00:06:50,252
honey, take a break.
It's okay.

109
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:51,687
No!

110
00:06:51,755 --> 00:06:53,255
Seriously, if there's something

111
00:06:53,323 --> 00:06:55,791
really wrong with him,
I-I wanna know about it.

112
00:06:55,859 --> 00:06:58,094
It's not.

113
00:06:58,161 --> 00:07:00,229
Our questions are about
what he eats for lunch at work

114
00:07:00,297 --> 00:07:02,531
<i>and what comes out at the end...</i>

115
00:07:02,599 --> 00:07:04,300
bowel movements, mostly.

116
00:07:04,367 --> 00:07:05,935
Color, texture.
Smell.

117
00:07:06,002 --> 00:07:07,169
Oka...

118
00:07:07,237 --> 00:07:09,405
Pretty sure you can't
help with that.

119
00:07:09,473 --> 00:07:11,140
Maybe I could use a break.

120
00:07:13,176 --> 00:07:15,644
Thank you for your honesty.

121
00:07:15,712 --> 00:07:17,513
You're welcome.

122
00:07:22,652 --> 00:07:24,787
I can't let my wife
find out about this.

123
00:07:24,855 --> 00:07:26,755
You have to promise me.

124
00:07:26,823 --> 00:07:28,090
That depends on if
it's considered...

125
00:07:28,158 --> 00:07:30,059
we promise.

126
00:07:30,127 --> 00:07:33,762
<i>I lost everything
because of the recession,</i>

127
00:07:33,830 --> 00:07:37,133
my entire real estate company.

128
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:40,102
And she has no idea.

129
00:07:40,170 --> 00:07:41,537
So what do you do
for a living now?

130
00:07:41,605 --> 00:07:43,672
I used to be a janitor
when I was in college,

131
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:45,074
and now I'm almost 40

132
00:07:45,142 --> 00:07:47,276
and doing it for
the people I built homes for.

133
00:07:47,344 --> 00:07:48,277
Why?

134
00:07:48,345 --> 00:07:50,613
What do you think?

135
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:52,681
'Cause I need the money.

136
00:07:52,749 --> 00:07:54,783
No, I mean why
lie to your wife about it?

137
00:07:54,851 --> 00:07:57,219
Oh, n-none of
our business, really.

138
00:07:57,287 --> 00:07:59,155
What kind of cleaning?

139
00:07:59,222 --> 00:08:01,123
Industrial jobs.

140
00:08:01,191 --> 00:08:02,958
Crime scene cleanup.

141
00:08:03,026 --> 00:08:05,828
<i>Septic tank repair.
Mold removal.</i>

142
00:08:05,896 --> 00:08:08,764
It's physically killing me.

143
00:08:08,832 --> 00:08:10,699
<i>It's the holy grail
of potential diseases...</i>

144
00:08:10,767 --> 00:08:13,002
<i>caustic cleaning chemicals,
raw sewage,</i>

145
00:08:13,069 --> 00:08:14,703
mold spores, fungal infections.

146
00:08:14,771 --> 00:08:16,138
And not to mention
cleaning up blood

147
00:08:16,206 --> 00:08:18,707
and other bodily fluids
from a homicide yesterday.

148
00:08:18,775 --> 00:08:20,009
<i>We should check
out the crime scene.</i>

149
00:08:20,076 --> 00:08:21,043
He might have picked up
a bacterial infection

150
00:08:21,111 --> 00:08:23,212
from the victim's blood.

151
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:26,048
<i>Place has been cleaned
and sanitized by our patient.</i>

152
00:08:26,116 --> 00:08:27,783
We sent for the autopsy report...
probably take a week to get it.

153
00:08:27,851 --> 00:08:29,285
When he's not working,

154
00:08:29,352 --> 00:08:31,387
where does he go all day
to hide out?

155
00:08:31,454 --> 00:08:32,755
His old real estate office?

156
00:08:32,822 --> 00:08:35,057
Treat for bacterial infection.
Meantime...

157
00:08:35,125 --> 00:08:38,127
Bert take Ernie and check
his office for environmentals.

158
00:08:38,195 --> 00:08:40,663
I'll talk to Cuddy about getting
the autopsy results faster.

159
00:08:43,867 --> 00:08:45,167
You're Bert.

160
00:08:45,235 --> 00:08:47,303
He's Ernie.

161
00:08:47,370 --> 00:08:48,804
And they're both roommates.

162
00:08:48,872 --> 00:08:50,639
That was a good one.

163
00:09:11,761 --> 00:09:12,928
Well...

164
00:09:12,996 --> 00:09:15,464
At least the Alzheimer's
patient in room 202

165
00:09:15,532 --> 00:09:17,833
won't remember she only
got half a ham sandwich.

166
00:09:17,901 --> 00:09:21,136
I'm doing her a favor.

167
00:09:21,204 --> 00:09:25,241
You're really going
to the charity gala?

168
00:09:25,308 --> 00:09:27,142
Why?

169
00:09:27,210 --> 00:09:29,511
I wanna do something
nice for my girlfriend.

170
00:09:29,579 --> 00:09:32,081
You never do anything
unless it stands to benefit you.

171
00:09:32,148 --> 00:09:33,415
I realize that three
failed marriages

172
00:09:33,483 --> 00:09:34,683
can leave a man
twisted and bitter inside,

173
00:09:34,751 --> 00:09:36,452
but in a good relationship,

174
00:09:36,519 --> 00:09:39,288
people sometimes do things
for each other.

175
00:09:39,356 --> 00:09:41,991
A hundred says
you don't show up.

176
00:09:44,427 --> 00:09:47,997
You're giving me an incentive
to actually show up?

177
00:09:48,064 --> 00:09:49,932
A personal, selfish incentive?

178
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,568
I'm just making easy money.

179
00:09:52,636 --> 00:09:53,636
200.

180
00:09:56,406 --> 00:09:59,375
How high did Cuddy
authorize you to go?

181
00:10:00,977 --> 00:10:02,845
She... she didn't...

182
00:10:04,281 --> 00:10:05,314
300.

183
00:10:05,382 --> 00:10:07,416
<i>She really
wants you there.</i>

184
00:10:07,484 --> 00:10:08,751
Why do people believe

185
00:10:08,818 --> 00:10:10,953
I'm incapable
of doing anything nice?

186
00:10:11,021 --> 00:10:12,988
<i>Experience.</i>

187
00:10:17,327 --> 00:10:19,061
It's a tie.

188
00:10:19,129 --> 00:10:21,530
I'm not wearing your underwear.

189
00:10:21,598 --> 00:10:23,565
<i>I said I was sorry.
You want the tie back?</i>

190
00:10:23,633 --> 00:10:25,067
Can we get to work?

191
00:10:25,135 --> 00:10:26,969
I can't tell if you're
being passive-aggressive

192
00:10:27,037 --> 00:10:29,905
or this is just your regular
fun-loving personality.

193
00:10:29,973 --> 00:10:31,907
Both. And you can
keep the tie.

194
00:10:31,975 --> 00:10:34,443
Went out of style
five years ago.

195
00:10:55,865 --> 00:10:57,733
Vicodin.

196
00:10:57,801 --> 00:10:59,335
And he doesn't have
a prescription.

197
00:10:59,402 --> 00:11:03,572
We didn't test for an allergic
reaction to narcotics.

198
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:05,007
<i>Or it's the obvious.</i>

199
00:11:05,075 --> 00:11:07,876
<i>Take a look at this.</i>

200
00:11:19,155 --> 00:11:21,190
We think you're suffering
from boric acid exposure.

201
00:11:21,257 --> 00:11:22,458
Which is causing the rash.

202
00:11:22,525 --> 00:11:23,826
We need to decontaminate
your skin

203
00:11:23,893 --> 00:11:25,394
and hope you didn't
inhale it into your lungs.

204
00:11:25,462 --> 00:11:27,596
I-I feel like I'm...

205
00:11:27,664 --> 00:11:30,199
never seen a fever spike
this fast before.

206
00:11:30,266 --> 00:11:32,701
Acid exposure burns literally.
It shouldn't be causing this.

207
00:11:32,769 --> 00:11:34,203
What's happening to him?

208
00:11:34,270 --> 00:11:35,938
Bert? Honey,
are you all right?

209
00:11:36,005 --> 00:11:37,439
<i>We have to get
his fever down right now.</i>

210
00:11:37,507 --> 00:11:38,874
If it gets any higher,

211
00:11:38,942 --> 00:11:41,410
it could cause permanent
brain damage.

212
00:11:43,297 --> 00:11:44,497
<i>We used cooling blankets</i>

213
00:11:44,565 --> 00:11:45,598
<i>to get his temperature
down.</i>

214
00:11:45,666 --> 00:11:46,966
He stabilized at 102.

215
00:11:47,034 --> 00:11:48,167
Problem's not boric acid.

216
00:11:48,235 --> 00:11:50,670
We found no traces of it
on his skin.

217
00:11:50,738 --> 00:11:53,172
<i>Infection from the
murder victim's blood?</i>

218
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:55,641
Autopsy report was negative

219
00:11:55,709 --> 00:11:57,777
for communicable disease.

220
00:11:57,845 --> 00:12:01,314
<i>Cause of death was
an overly stabby girlfriend.</i>

221
00:12:01,381 --> 00:12:02,448
We found Vicodin in his office.

222
00:12:02,516 --> 00:12:03,683
Give it to me.

223
00:12:05,786 --> 00:12:08,755
Might look like Vicodin
but be something else.

224
00:12:28,075 --> 00:12:30,409
It's real.

225
00:12:31,612 --> 00:12:33,346
<i>Unfortunately...</i>

226
00:12:33,413 --> 00:12:37,517
His Vicodin doesn't cause
rash, fever, and joint pain.

227
00:12:37,584 --> 00:12:40,219
Does make Taub considerably
less annoying, though.

228
00:12:40,287 --> 00:12:42,188
<i>Maybe we're thinking
too far outside the box here.</i>

229
00:12:42,256 --> 00:12:44,757
Just because he could have
picked up any one of a hundred

230
00:12:44,825 --> 00:12:46,659
exotic diseases from his job
doesn't mean he didn't.

231
00:12:46,727 --> 00:12:49,162
Taub's life partner
has a point.

232
00:12:49,229 --> 00:12:52,165
<i>Started treatment with
antibiotics, and he got worse.</i>

233
00:12:52,232 --> 00:12:54,267
Simple answer begins with "m"
ends with "Mia."

234
00:12:54,334 --> 00:12:55,701
Meningococcemia?

235
00:12:55,769 --> 00:12:57,069
That works too.

236
00:12:57,137 --> 00:12:59,572
<i>Confirm
with a lumbar puncture.</i>

237
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:01,040
And on the off chance
we're wrong,

238
00:13:01,108 --> 00:13:02,375
find out what else
he's been lying about

239
00:13:02,442 --> 00:13:03,843
besides his job
and his drug use.

240
00:13:11,752 --> 00:13:14,053
You sure do hide a lot
from your wife.

241
00:13:14,121 --> 00:13:17,824
Your job, your drug use.
What else?

242
00:13:17,891 --> 00:13:19,192
<i>What does it
matter?</i>

243
00:13:19,259 --> 00:13:21,761
Can't help you unless you're
completely honest with us.

244
00:13:21,829 --> 00:13:23,996
I was doing manual labor.

245
00:13:24,064 --> 00:13:25,798
If I came home
barely able to move,

246
00:13:25,866 --> 00:13:27,600
Diane would know
something's up.

247
00:13:27,668 --> 00:13:29,802
<i>That's why I take the Vicodin...
to hide the pain.</i>

248
00:13:29,870 --> 00:13:31,504
I'm not an addict.

249
00:13:31,572 --> 00:13:33,773
Is that all you're hiding?

250
00:13:35,809 --> 00:13:37,810
I didn't just lose my job.

251
00:13:37,878 --> 00:13:39,779
<i>Well, that's how
it started,</i>

252
00:13:39,847 --> 00:13:42,849
but I figured it'd just
last a couple months.

253
00:13:42,916 --> 00:13:45,651
I maxed out our credit cards,

254
00:13:45,719 --> 00:13:48,554
<i>took a double mortgage
on the house,</i>

255
00:13:48,622 --> 00:13:52,158
<i>and I sold all of
our investments.</i>

256
00:13:52,226 --> 00:13:53,960
Who'd have thought
the recession

257
00:13:54,027 --> 00:13:55,795
would last this long, huh?

258
00:13:55,863 --> 00:13:59,198
So it's Obama's fault
you're lying to your wife?

259
00:13:59,266 --> 00:14:02,435
Look...I screwed up.

260
00:14:02,502 --> 00:14:05,304
It's too late now.

261
00:14:05,372 --> 00:14:06,772
I want you to roll over
on your left side

262
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:07,773
for the procedure.

263
00:14:13,046 --> 00:14:14,614
<i>Haven't you ever
done something</i>

264
00:14:14,681 --> 00:14:18,217
in a relationship
you wish you could take back?

265
00:14:18,285 --> 00:14:19,518
Maybe.

266
00:14:19,586 --> 00:14:22,355
How'd you handle it?

267
00:14:22,422 --> 00:14:23,522
I told the truth.

268
00:14:23,590 --> 00:14:26,592
Eventually.

269
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:28,227
How'd that work out?

270
00:14:28,295 --> 00:14:31,397
Not well.

271
00:14:37,537 --> 00:14:39,939
<i>I need some intel</i>

272
00:14:40,007 --> 00:14:42,074
on this charity event
on Friday night.

273
00:14:42,142 --> 00:14:45,478
If I go, do I have to
actually give money to charity?

274
00:14:49,116 --> 00:14:50,650
I'm going.

275
00:14:50,717 --> 00:14:52,285
Just don't want it to suck.

276
00:14:52,352 --> 00:14:55,054
There has to be a way
to make this fun.

277
00:14:55,122 --> 00:14:57,957
Show up and behave.
Problem solved.

278
00:14:58,025 --> 00:14:59,759
Your problem solved.

279
00:14:59,826 --> 00:15:01,294
<i>Don't you think
she deserves more</i>

280
00:15:01,361 --> 00:15:03,763
than a plaque
and a round of applause

281
00:15:03,830 --> 00:15:05,798
for 15 years
of running this dump?

282
00:15:05,866 --> 00:15:07,233
It's a watch, not a plaque.

283
00:15:07,301 --> 00:15:09,302
It's a cliche.

284
00:15:09,369 --> 00:15:11,904
I want to make things
more exciting,

285
00:15:11,972 --> 00:15:14,273
<i>something she'll remember
for more than ten minutes.</i>

286
00:15:14,341 --> 00:15:15,841
Okay. By fun and exciting,

287
00:15:15,909 --> 00:15:17,476
you mean screwing this up
for Cuddy

288
00:15:17,544 --> 00:15:21,247
so she won't even dream of
asking you to go to one again.

289
00:15:21,315 --> 00:15:26,719
You really can't stand
seeing me happy, can you?

290
00:15:29,022 --> 00:15:31,724
Gram stains are negative
in the first CSF samples.

291
00:15:31,792 --> 00:15:35,027
One down, three to go.

292
00:15:35,095 --> 00:15:37,530
I'm starving.
You wanna get a bite after...

293
00:15:37,597 --> 00:15:39,098
already have plans.
Date?

294
00:15:39,166 --> 00:15:40,533
What difference does it make?

295
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:42,301
We're roommates,
not a married couple.

296
00:15:42,369 --> 00:15:44,303
We don't have to eat
every night together.

297
00:15:44,371 --> 00:15:47,206
So you're saying...
It's a date?

298
00:15:47,274 --> 00:15:49,742
Yeah, it's a date.

299
00:15:49,810 --> 00:15:51,744
I don't have plans.

300
00:15:51,812 --> 00:15:53,479
Ooh. Shocking.

301
00:15:53,547 --> 00:15:55,881
Are you mad
because I picked you?

302
00:15:55,949 --> 00:15:57,817
You're stuck actually
doing your job?

303
00:15:57,884 --> 00:15:59,385
A little hazing never
hurt a med student.

304
00:15:59,453 --> 00:16:01,220
I doubt it ever...
Helped either.

305
00:16:01,288 --> 00:16:03,356
I'm sorry that I think

306
00:16:03,423 --> 00:16:05,224
our patient shouldn't
be lying to his wife.

307
00:16:05,292 --> 00:16:06,492
I'm a woman.

308
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:08,427
I guess I just have
a different perspective.

309
00:16:08,495 --> 00:16:10,429
You're sharing
this unique insight

310
00:16:10,497 --> 00:16:12,431
that women don't like lying?

311
00:16:12,499 --> 00:16:13,866
<i>Uh, no, I'm sharing
my unique insight</i>

312
00:16:13,934 --> 00:16:15,501
that you don't respect women.

313
00:16:15,569 --> 00:16:17,937
You sleep with a different
one every few days.

314
00:16:18,005 --> 00:16:21,007
Or maybe...
You find meaning

315
00:16:21,074 --> 00:16:23,342
in meaningless relationships.

316
00:16:23,410 --> 00:16:25,911
At least I have relationships.

317
00:16:25,979 --> 00:16:28,280
I'm seeing a high lymphocyte
count in the CSF sample.

318
00:16:28,348 --> 00:16:29,815
And that couldn't wait

319
00:16:29,883 --> 00:16:31,350
<i>until they finished
mocking each other?</i>

320
00:16:31,418 --> 00:16:34,153
That means it's not
meningococcemia.

321
00:16:37,824 --> 00:16:39,892
He's getting worse!
He can barely move his legs.

322
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:41,694
<i>I can't feel them.
I can't feel my feet.</i>

323
00:16:45,132 --> 00:16:46,532
What is it?

324
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:48,034
<i>What is happening to him?</i>

325
00:16:52,155 --> 00:16:53,389
Luckily, he
didn't lose his feet.

326
00:16:53,457 --> 00:16:54,690
We were able to restore
his circulation

327
00:16:54,758 --> 00:16:56,559
before any serious
damage set in.

328
00:16:56,627 --> 00:16:59,462
It's not meningococcemia.
CSF was negative for bacteria.

329
00:16:59,529 --> 00:17:00,763
But high on lymphocytes.

330
00:17:00,831 --> 00:17:02,398
It's some kind of
viral infection.

331
00:17:02,466 --> 00:17:04,166
Serum sickness fits everything.

332
00:17:04,234 --> 00:17:06,769
There'd have to be a cause,
some drug he's been exposed to.

333
00:17:06,837 --> 00:17:08,938
In rare cases,
a tick or a spider bite

334
00:17:09,006 --> 00:17:10,906
could set it off...
show of hands.

335
00:17:10,974 --> 00:17:12,808
Who's going to this
charity thing Friday night?

336
00:17:12,876 --> 00:17:14,744
Already got a date.

337
00:17:14,811 --> 00:17:17,146
Cuddy is getting an award.

338
00:17:17,214 --> 00:17:20,449
I think we should
all be there, show our support.

339
00:17:20,517 --> 00:17:21,717
I assume you're planning
on screwing it up,

340
00:17:21,785 --> 00:17:23,019
so you want to maximize
witnesses.

341
00:17:23,086 --> 00:17:24,587
Why does everyone go to that?

342
00:17:24,655 --> 00:17:25,755
Experience?

343
00:17:25,822 --> 00:17:27,890
Shut up!

344
00:17:27,958 --> 00:17:30,259
How 'bout go...Or work
the clinic all weekend?

345
00:17:30,327 --> 00:17:32,561
I hear it's genital herpes
awareness month.

346
00:17:32,629 --> 00:17:35,498
Serum sickness fits.

347
00:17:35,565 --> 00:17:38,968
Take him off the antibiotics.
Start him on corticosteroids.

348
00:17:39,036 --> 00:17:41,270
If we're right,
he'll be better by morning.

349
00:17:45,876 --> 00:17:47,510
Canceled date, huh?

350
00:17:47,577 --> 00:17:49,645
You're bugging my cell phone?

351
00:17:49,713 --> 00:17:53,115
No. I just noticed
you're not wearing it.

352
00:17:53,183 --> 00:17:55,084
What?

353
00:17:55,152 --> 00:17:57,753
Your first-date shirt.

354
00:17:57,821 --> 00:18:00,523
You tracking my wardrobe?
I'm just observant.

355
00:18:00,590 --> 00:18:02,958
That's why I'm good at my job.
It's also the reason

356
00:18:03,026 --> 00:18:05,961
you're starting to annoy
the crap out of me.

357
00:18:06,029 --> 00:18:07,596
Forgive me for trying
to connect a little

358
00:18:07,664 --> 00:18:10,032
with my roommate.

359
00:18:14,671 --> 00:18:17,807
I just found out
that Rachel is now

360
00:18:17,874 --> 00:18:20,242
officially more
than just emotional

361
00:18:20,310 --> 00:18:23,346
with her online friend.

362
00:18:23,413 --> 00:18:27,016
You're getting divorced.
What did you expect?

363
00:18:27,084 --> 00:18:28,784
I know.
You're right.

364
00:18:28,852 --> 00:18:31,954
Just...Thinking about it

365
00:18:32,022 --> 00:18:34,357
kinda makes me wanna throw up.

366
00:18:37,594 --> 00:18:41,063
You still wanna get
something to eat?

367
00:18:41,131 --> 00:18:42,898
I could cook.

368
00:18:46,470 --> 00:18:48,170
<i>Ooh. That had to hurt.</i>

369
00:18:48,238 --> 00:18:50,706
Not as bad as you.
You just missed a free upgrade.

370
00:18:50,774 --> 00:18:52,108
Ha. Just did it again.

371
00:18:52,175 --> 00:18:53,809
You ran past the power up.

372
00:18:53,877 --> 00:18:55,277
<i>Double damn!</i>

373
00:18:58,882 --> 00:19:00,549
Are you just letting me win?

374
00:19:00,617 --> 00:19:04,053
Of course I'm not
letting you...

375
00:19:04,121 --> 00:19:06,021
Okay, maybe a little.

376
00:19:06,089 --> 00:19:08,357
You're having fun, right?
Not anymore.

377
00:19:08,425 --> 00:19:10,526
I used to think
the whole brooding thing

378
00:19:10,594 --> 00:19:11,794
was just part of
your work persona,

379
00:19:11,862 --> 00:19:13,129
but now I live with you.

380
00:19:13,196 --> 00:19:15,097
You need to lighten up, Bert.

381
00:19:15,165 --> 00:19:16,999
And you think I need you
to show me what?

382
00:19:17,067 --> 00:19:18,534
How to have fun, relax?

383
00:19:18,602 --> 00:19:20,603
It was working
till you flipped out.

384
00:19:22,639 --> 00:19:24,640
If I was gonna take advice
on how to live my life,

385
00:19:24,708 --> 00:19:26,609
<i>it would not be from you.</i>

386
00:19:26,676 --> 00:19:28,644
<i>You're broke,
you ruined your marriage,</i>

387
00:19:28,712 --> 00:19:30,880
and yet you act like
you're the victim here,

388
00:19:30,947 --> 00:19:33,783
like somehow we're all
supposed to feel sorry for you.

389
00:19:33,850 --> 00:19:35,050
You screwed up your life,

390
00:19:35,118 --> 00:19:37,386
not some emotional friend
your wife met on the...

391
00:19:38,822 --> 00:19:40,823
What's wrong?
My stomach. You...

392
00:19:40,891 --> 00:19:42,925
you poisoned me!

393
00:19:42,993 --> 00:19:44,160
I ate the same thing you did.

394
00:19:44,227 --> 00:19:45,561
How come I'm not...

395
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:52,101
Oh, dear God.

396
00:19:53,603 --> 00:19:55,070
Open the door, Bert, please.

397
00:19:55,138 --> 00:19:56,872
Baby, talk to me.

398
00:19:56,940 --> 00:19:59,675
He locked himself inside.
He went crazy.

399
00:19:59,743 --> 00:20:02,044
He hit me.

400
00:20:02,746 --> 00:20:03,746
Bert.

401
00:20:03,814 --> 00:20:06,048
<i>Open the door, Bert.</i>

402
00:20:09,119 --> 00:20:10,152
<i>Bert?</i>

403
00:20:30,841 --> 00:20:32,241
I can't get out!
Why?

404
00:20:32,309 --> 00:20:34,410
I can't get out!

405
00:20:34,478 --> 00:20:35,911
Oh, lord, oh, no!

406
00:20:35,979 --> 00:20:38,080
Why can't I...Get out?

407
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:40,760
Skin rash is gone.

408
00:20:40,828 --> 00:20:42,162
But whatever it is,

409
00:20:42,230 --> 00:20:43,697
it obviously
moved into his brain.

410
00:20:43,764 --> 00:20:45,398
<i>Or not. (Masters) He had
a psychotic break.</i>

411
00:20:45,466 --> 00:20:47,834
I'd say that usually indicates
neurological involvement.

412
00:20:47,902 --> 00:20:49,803
Usually.
Not always.

413
00:20:49,871 --> 00:20:51,171
<i>The hallucinations
stopped</i>

414
00:20:51,239 --> 00:20:53,240
once the steroids we gave him
cleared his system.

415
00:20:53,307 --> 00:20:55,275
I think that...
Mm.

416
00:20:55,343 --> 00:20:57,210
I think we caused this.

417
00:20:57,278 --> 00:20:59,546
What happened to you?

418
00:20:59,614 --> 00:21:01,882
Taub tried to kill me
last night.

419
00:21:01,949 --> 00:21:03,450
<i>The steroids probably</i>

420
00:21:03,518 --> 00:21:05,151
did clear up the rash,

421
00:21:05,219 --> 00:21:06,820
but the rest of
his symptoms are the same.

422
00:21:06,888 --> 00:21:08,722
<i>And now bilateral
conjunctivitis.</i>

423
00:21:08,789 --> 00:21:10,457
Uh, excuse me.
I'll be back.

424
00:21:12,393 --> 00:21:14,427
I...

425
00:21:14,495 --> 00:21:17,230
I, uh, better go check on him.

426
00:21:28,075 --> 00:21:30,477
<i>Swollen joints,
high white count, fever.</i>

427
00:21:30,545 --> 00:21:31,645
<i>Conjunctivitis.</i>

428
00:21:31,712 --> 00:21:33,747
Anyone?

429
00:21:33,814 --> 00:21:35,582
Seriously?

430
00:21:35,650 --> 00:21:38,018
What, you two can't think
and poop at the same time?

431
00:21:38,085 --> 00:21:41,254
There's a life at stake here!

432
00:21:41,322 --> 00:21:43,089
<i>Uh...Could be</i>

433
00:21:43,157 --> 00:21:44,658
familial mediterranean fever?

434
00:21:44,725 --> 00:21:46,159
Not likely.

435
00:21:46,227 --> 00:21:49,029
That almost always presents
with abdominal pain or...

436
00:21:49,096 --> 00:21:50,931
<i>Diarrhea.</i>

437
00:21:52,199 --> 00:21:54,668
Given his job,
the skin and eye involvement,

438
00:21:54,735 --> 00:21:57,704
it's more likely
a systemic fungal infection.

439
00:21:57,772 --> 00:21:59,839
Well, we would have
seen it in his blood work.

440
00:21:59,907 --> 00:22:02,776
Unless the saline used

441
00:22:02,843 --> 00:22:05,178
to recover and store
the tissue samples

442
00:22:05,246 --> 00:22:06,546
has been shown
in recent studies...

443
00:22:06,614 --> 00:22:07,948
get new blood and CSF samples

444
00:22:08,015 --> 00:22:10,116
using formaldehyde
instead of saline.

445
00:22:10,184 --> 00:22:13,653
And start him and his wife
on triple antifungal therapy.

446
00:22:13,721 --> 00:22:15,221
His wife?

447
00:22:15,289 --> 00:22:17,123
Well, if he's really trying
to keep her happy,

448
00:22:17,191 --> 00:22:19,726
I assume
they've shared bodily fluids.

449
00:22:24,198 --> 00:22:25,465
I hate you.

450
00:22:26,867 --> 00:22:29,869
You could have picked it up
from your job.

451
00:22:29,937 --> 00:22:33,406
The...Real one,
not the fake one.

452
00:22:33,474 --> 00:22:34,674
<i>If you had been
more honest about...</i>

453
00:22:34,742 --> 00:22:36,543
how is that relevant?

454
00:22:36,611 --> 00:22:38,845
If his wife knew about his job,

455
00:22:38,913 --> 00:22:40,180
they both might have been
more alert

456
00:22:40,247 --> 00:22:42,115
to the early symptoms.

457
00:22:42,183 --> 00:22:43,550
We could have
caught it earlier.

458
00:22:43,618 --> 00:22:45,986
That's ridiculous.

459
00:22:49,690 --> 00:22:51,358
My God, sweetheart,
I'm so sorry.

460
00:22:51,425 --> 00:22:54,594
Whatever you're doing,
it's obviously not working.

461
00:22:54,662 --> 00:22:56,963
We think he has
a systemic fungal infection.

462
00:22:57,031 --> 00:22:59,065
<i>We're starting him on a
parenteral antifungal regimen.</i>

463
00:22:59,133 --> 00:23:00,600
It can be transferred
through bodily fluids,

464
00:23:00,668 --> 00:23:02,402
so we have to start you
on the treatment as well.

465
00:23:02,470 --> 00:23:04,871
A fungus?
Where would he...

466
00:23:04,939 --> 00:23:06,539
it could be from anywhere.
The spores can become airborne.

467
00:23:06,607 --> 00:23:08,141
But why would he be
the only one?

468
00:23:08,209 --> 00:23:09,876
No one in our neighborhood,

469
00:23:09,944 --> 00:23:11,745
no one in his office building?

470
00:23:11,812 --> 00:23:14,347
Sometimes it just
happens...That way.

471
00:23:14,415 --> 00:23:16,349
It's hard to explain.

472
00:23:16,417 --> 00:23:18,418
No. It's not.

473
00:23:21,856 --> 00:23:24,090
I need to talk to my wife
in private for a moment.

474
00:23:36,837 --> 00:23:38,772
Your numbers indicate
the medication

475
00:23:38,839 --> 00:23:40,140
isn't helping
with your cholesterol.

476
00:23:53,954 --> 00:23:55,121
Hey!

477
00:23:57,992 --> 00:23:59,392
Huh?
What are you doing?

478
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:01,361
What's it look like I'm doing?

479
00:24:01,429 --> 00:24:02,929
Auditioning a band
for Friday night.

480
00:24:02,997 --> 00:24:04,764
So you're trying
to ruin Cuddy's moment

481
00:24:04,832 --> 00:24:06,499
in the spotlight.

482
00:24:06,567 --> 00:24:09,869
Ruin? These guys recorded
with Juan Gabriel.

483
00:24:09,937 --> 00:24:11,171
They're gonna cost me 2 grand.

484
00:24:11,238 --> 00:24:12,706
This is not a prank.

485
00:24:12,773 --> 00:24:14,107
These guys are the beginning

486
00:24:14,175 --> 00:24:15,909
<i>of Cuddy's evening
to remember.</i>

487
00:24:15,976 --> 00:24:18,411
Which, in turn,
will make my evening...

488
00:24:18,479 --> 00:24:20,180
I think, if you do this,

489
00:24:20,247 --> 00:24:22,082
your evening will end
with you in your apartment

490
00:24:22,149 --> 00:24:23,850
alone...With a sock.

491
00:24:25,686 --> 00:24:28,621
<i>Muchachos, adelante.</i>

492
00:24:28,689 --> 00:24:29,889
<i>Tres, cuatro...</i>

493
00:24:41,836 --> 00:24:43,803
This is all for the best.

494
00:24:43,871 --> 00:24:45,305
Yeah.

495
00:24:45,372 --> 00:24:47,173
Either that or...
The opposite.

496
00:24:49,643 --> 00:24:51,578
If it means anything, um...

497
00:24:51,645 --> 00:24:53,813
I think he's honestly
just trying to protect you

498
00:24:53,881 --> 00:24:55,315
and keep you happy.

499
00:24:55,382 --> 00:24:57,917
Oh, God, of course he would
tell a bunch of strangers

500
00:24:57,985 --> 00:24:59,185
before he would tell me.

501
00:24:59,253 --> 00:25:01,287
I mean, why not?

502
00:25:01,355 --> 00:25:02,655
I'm just a stupid
housewife, right?

503
00:25:02,723 --> 00:25:05,158
You know, I have something
you can share with him.

504
00:25:05,226 --> 00:25:06,526
It's over.

505
00:25:06,594 --> 00:25:08,828
He's a liar, and I never
want to hear from him again.

506
00:25:08,896 --> 00:25:11,164
You may wanna go check on him.
His fever's back.

507
00:25:11,232 --> 00:25:13,733
But I am done
worrying about him.

508
00:25:16,704 --> 00:25:18,238
She's right.
He's at 101. Diane?

509
00:25:18,305 --> 00:25:20,306
We're gonna have to get
your fever down.

510
00:25:20,374 --> 00:25:22,208
What... what's wrong?
What are you saying?

511
00:25:24,044 --> 00:25:25,779
I can't hear you.

512
00:25:25,846 --> 00:25:27,947
I can't...
I can't hear anything!

513
00:25:28,015 --> 00:25:29,849
Why can't I hear anything?

514
00:25:32,889 --> 00:25:34,556
His hearing is
almost completely gone.

515
00:25:34,624 --> 00:25:36,025
The new blood and CSF tests

516
00:25:36,092 --> 00:25:38,394
were negative
for spores and fungus.

517
00:25:38,461 --> 00:25:40,662
Tumor necrosis factor syndrome?

518
00:25:40,730 --> 00:25:43,966
Fits the conjunctivitis and
painful swelling in his joints.

519
00:25:44,034 --> 00:25:45,134
Except it's never been
documented

520
00:25:45,201 --> 00:25:46,869
to cause hearing loss.

521
00:25:46,936 --> 00:25:48,203
Ever.

522
00:25:48,271 --> 00:25:50,272
Oh, no, she di'int!

523
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:52,207
This isn't the classroom.
In the real world,

524
00:25:52,275 --> 00:25:53,675
real doctors know
that patients can have

525
00:25:53,743 --> 00:25:55,310
more than one thing
wrong with them.

526
00:25:55,378 --> 00:25:56,945
<i>Zing.
He was taking Vicodin.</i>

527
00:25:57,013 --> 00:25:58,614
Extreme abusers
can experience hearing loss.

528
00:25:58,681 --> 00:26:00,482
Except his drug levels

529
00:26:00,550 --> 00:26:02,151
never got into
the ototoxic zone.

530
00:26:02,218 --> 00:26:04,787
You have a better idea?

531
00:26:04,854 --> 00:26:06,055
I do.

532
00:26:06,122 --> 00:26:07,356
Only in the sense

533
00:26:07,424 --> 00:26:09,058
that you're wasting my time
with a bad idea

534
00:26:09,125 --> 00:26:11,093
and she's wasting my time
with no idea.

535
00:26:11,161 --> 00:26:13,829
<i>Maybe we should hear
from silent and silenter.</i>

536
00:26:13,897 --> 00:26:14,797
It's probably neurological.

537
00:26:14,864 --> 00:26:16,198
Brain tumor?

538
00:26:16,266 --> 00:26:17,766
Or a viral infection
that's reached his brain.

539
00:26:17,834 --> 00:26:19,701
I say we go with Ernie
on this one.

540
00:26:19,769 --> 00:26:21,170
Get an MRI.
Find it.

541
00:26:22,639 --> 00:26:25,140
I'm gonna move out next week.

542
00:26:25,208 --> 00:26:28,677
I'd rather stay friends
than be roommates.

543
00:26:28,745 --> 00:26:31,680
Just make sure
I get my keys back.

544
00:26:31,748 --> 00:26:34,583
It's not my fault.

545
00:26:34,651 --> 00:26:36,752
I cooked it thoroughly!

546
00:26:39,322 --> 00:26:41,123
Looking forward
to Friday night?

547
00:26:41,191 --> 00:26:43,826
Yes and no.

548
00:26:43,893 --> 00:26:45,961
Yes, because it is
a great honor,

549
00:26:46,029 --> 00:26:48,030
and no because...

550
00:26:48,098 --> 00:26:49,598
Well, you know the because.

551
00:26:49,666 --> 00:26:51,967
You think House
is going to embarrass you.

552
00:26:52,035 --> 00:26:53,535
Well, not intentionally.

553
00:26:55,505 --> 00:26:57,606
Maybe intentionally.
I know what you mean.

554
00:26:57,674 --> 00:27:00,342
I picture him doing
something stupid like...

555
00:27:00,410 --> 00:27:02,878
Hiring a mariachi band
or something.

556
00:27:05,515 --> 00:27:07,716
Well, actually,
I could get behind that.

557
00:27:07,784 --> 00:27:09,384
I tried to hire one last year,

558
00:27:09,452 --> 00:27:10,686
but the board wouldn't let me

559
00:27:10,753 --> 00:27:13,555
because they thought
it was too expensive.

560
00:27:16,059 --> 00:27:18,127
I'm freezing.

561
00:27:27,637 --> 00:27:30,072
Is... is Diane coming back?

562
00:27:57,634 --> 00:28:00,536
Bedside 101...
when a patient is near death,

563
00:28:00,603 --> 00:28:01,970
try to be nice.

564
00:28:02,038 --> 00:28:04,006
She's not coming back.
I'm not gonna lie to him.

565
00:28:04,073 --> 00:28:05,641
Stop.

566
00:28:05,708 --> 00:28:07,543
What? You heard what she said.
He's seizing.

567
00:28:07,610 --> 00:28:08,877
We gotta get him out of there.

568
00:28:18,321 --> 00:28:20,155
<i>Both his kidneys are fried.</i>

569
00:28:20,223 --> 00:28:21,590
<i>He's in a coma.</i>

570
00:28:21,658 --> 00:28:23,525
<i>He has maybe
a few days left.</i>

571
00:28:23,593 --> 00:28:26,228
<i>We can try and get
him on the transplant list,</i>

572
00:28:26,296 --> 00:28:28,730
but in his condition
and without a diagnosis,

573
00:28:28,798 --> 00:28:31,433
I don't see him
getting selected.

574
00:28:31,501 --> 00:28:33,402
He wouldn't
survive the surgery.

575
00:28:33,469 --> 00:28:35,871
Hence my previous comment.

576
00:28:35,939 --> 00:28:37,906
What do you
want us to do, House?

577
00:28:42,845 --> 00:28:46,014
If it's a tumor,
we start chemo.

578
00:28:46,082 --> 00:28:48,617
Bombard his head
with radiation.

579
00:28:48,685 --> 00:28:50,319
<i>Which will probably
kill him in this state.</i>

580
00:28:50,386 --> 00:28:52,221
And without an MRI,

581
00:28:52,288 --> 00:28:55,324
we don't even know
if he has one.

582
00:28:55,391 --> 00:28:57,659
He's definitely dead
if we do nothing.

583
00:28:57,727 --> 00:28:59,261
If I'm wrong,

584
00:28:59,329 --> 00:29:02,598
all we do
is shave a few hours off.

585
00:29:02,665 --> 00:29:03,732
We'll need his wife's consent.

586
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:05,767
Masters will get it.

587
00:29:05,835 --> 00:29:08,070
Probably not a good idea.

588
00:29:08,137 --> 00:29:09,771
<i>Uh, he's right.
No, he's not.</i>

589
00:29:09,839 --> 00:29:12,874
Consider this me officially
booting you out of the nest.

590
00:29:28,758 --> 00:29:30,359
Just wanted to watch.

591
00:29:30,426 --> 00:29:32,861
Do you even like me?

592
00:29:32,929 --> 00:29:35,063
Why?

593
00:29:35,131 --> 00:29:37,399
I put making friends
and having relationships on hold

594
00:29:37,467 --> 00:29:39,501
so I could concentrate
on studying.

595
00:29:39,569 --> 00:29:40,836
I always thought

596
00:29:40,903 --> 00:29:43,238
there'll be plenty of time
for that in the future.

597
00:29:43,306 --> 00:29:45,741
But...

598
00:29:45,808 --> 00:29:48,744
Now when I do want them...

599
00:29:52,882 --> 00:29:55,083
I can't even get a date
to this charity event.

600
00:29:55,151 --> 00:29:57,286
If I can't establish
relationships

601
00:29:57,353 --> 00:29:59,454
in my personal life,

602
00:29:59,522 --> 00:30:01,490
how will I ever
do it with a patient?

603
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:12,200
Be honest with her.

604
00:30:12,268 --> 00:30:14,002
But if it comes down
to a choice

605
00:30:14,070 --> 00:30:16,071
between the brutal truth
and hope,

606
00:30:16,139 --> 00:30:17,673
side with hope.

607
00:30:27,317 --> 00:30:29,885
He's in a coma.

608
00:30:29,952 --> 00:30:31,920
We think it's a brain tumor,

609
00:30:31,988 --> 00:30:34,589
and we need your permission
to start treatment.

610
00:30:34,657 --> 00:30:37,292
Due to his current condition,
the risk factor...

611
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:39,528
you mean...
It could kill him?

612
00:30:39,595 --> 00:30:43,265
It's possible.

613
00:30:43,333 --> 00:30:46,268
But...There is still hope.

614
00:30:49,105 --> 00:30:51,239
Can he hear me?

615
00:30:51,307 --> 00:30:53,342
They say that...

616
00:30:53,409 --> 00:30:55,844
that people in comas
can still do that.

617
00:30:55,912 --> 00:30:59,948
Sometimes,
but your husband's hearing...

618
00:31:01,851 --> 00:31:04,119
Is fine.

619
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:27,642
I didn't mean any
of those awful things I said.

620
00:31:27,710 --> 00:31:30,579
I'm so sorry.

621
00:31:35,585 --> 00:31:37,753
I love you, Bert.

622
00:31:40,356 --> 00:31:42,391
I've always loved you.

623
00:31:49,699 --> 00:31:52,667
I also kept a secret from you.

624
00:31:54,804 --> 00:31:57,773
I was gonna tell you
at the restaurant...

625
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:59,741
But you got sick.

626
00:32:03,179 --> 00:32:06,047
And I wanted to wait
until you felt better.

627
00:32:15,358 --> 00:32:17,759
I'm pregnant, sweetheart.

628
00:32:30,273 --> 00:32:33,108
<i>You're gonna be a daddy.</i>

629
00:32:43,882 --> 00:32:45,383
<i>Why rash again?</i>

630
00:32:45,450 --> 00:32:46,617
<i>It went away.</i>

631
00:32:46,685 --> 00:32:48,319
It needs a reason to come back.

632
00:32:48,387 --> 00:32:50,488
We know it's not
an allergic reaction,

633
00:32:50,556 --> 00:32:52,857
so we must have done something
to set it off again.

634
00:32:52,925 --> 00:32:54,458
What?

635
00:32:54,526 --> 00:32:56,694
We put him on dialysis?
Moved him to the icu?

636
00:32:56,762 --> 00:32:59,130
We also did a partial MRI.
Two hours before the rash came back.

637
00:32:59,198 --> 00:33:00,965
They're not connected.

638
00:33:01,033 --> 00:33:02,300
What was he doing

639
00:33:02,367 --> 00:33:03,568
two hours before
he broke out the first time?

640
00:33:03,635 --> 00:33:04,836
Cleaning a crime scene.

641
00:33:04,903 --> 00:33:06,704
Crime scene and an MRI.

642
00:33:06,772 --> 00:33:08,105
<i>Still not seeing
the connection.</i>

643
00:33:08,173 --> 00:33:10,041
We've been missing
connections this entire case.

644
00:33:10,108 --> 00:33:11,475
Did he say anything?

645
00:33:11,543 --> 00:33:13,845
Did he show any signs of
stress in the MRI room?

646
00:33:13,912 --> 00:33:15,880
He said he was cold,

647
00:33:15,948 --> 00:33:18,349
<i>but it's always
freezing in there.</i>

648
00:33:18,417 --> 00:33:20,318
Cold and rash.

649
00:33:20,385 --> 00:33:21,886
Cold urticaria causes rash,

650
00:33:21,954 --> 00:33:24,255
but it's almost instantaneous
and not time-delayed.

651
00:33:24,323 --> 00:33:27,124
<i>And it wouldn't
explain his other symptoms.</i>

652
00:33:27,192 --> 00:33:30,094
That's what we did.

653
00:33:30,162 --> 00:33:32,663
We made him cold.

654
00:33:36,268 --> 00:33:37,935
Caps.

655
00:33:39,938 --> 00:33:43,541
Genetic disorder caused by
a mutation in the cold-induced

656
00:33:43,609 --> 00:33:45,710
autoinflammatory
syndrome one gene.

657
00:33:45,777 --> 00:33:47,211
Muckle-Wells syndrome?

658
00:33:47,279 --> 00:33:49,180
There's only been
a couple thousand

659
00:33:49,248 --> 00:33:50,915
documented cases
in the U.S.

660
00:33:50,983 --> 00:33:53,818
Well, now there's
a couple thousand and one.

661
00:33:53,886 --> 00:33:55,386
Fits every symptom there.

662
00:33:55,454 --> 00:33:59,290
We're idiots
for not seeing it before.

663
00:33:59,358 --> 00:34:01,425
Treat with rilonacept.

664
00:34:01,493 --> 00:34:03,928
He'll live a long
and healthy life

665
00:34:03,996 --> 00:34:06,797
filled with lies to his wife
and future child.

666
00:36:05,550 --> 00:36:07,752
You okay?

667
00:36:07,819 --> 00:36:09,854
Why wouldn't I be?

668
00:36:09,921 --> 00:36:11,722
Solved my case.

669
00:36:11,790 --> 00:36:14,558
But your patient died.

670
00:36:14,626 --> 00:36:16,394
I didn't say in time.

671
00:36:18,597 --> 00:36:20,431
It happens.

672
00:36:20,499 --> 00:36:23,401
<i>I can't save everyone.</i>

673
00:36:23,468 --> 00:36:26,037
I just came to apologize.

674
00:36:26,104 --> 00:36:27,872
<i>You're right.</i>

675
00:36:27,939 --> 00:36:30,374
I am turning bitter
and cynical inside.

676
00:36:30,442 --> 00:36:31,542
You're finally putting
the cat down.

677
00:36:31,610 --> 00:36:33,477
She loves mariachi.

678
00:36:33,545 --> 00:36:35,413
I told you.

679
00:36:37,115 --> 00:36:39,183
Go home and...Change.

680
00:36:39,251 --> 00:36:41,719
Party's in a few hours.

681
00:36:50,796 --> 00:36:53,097
You don't have to move out

682
00:36:53,165 --> 00:36:55,433
<i>if you don't want to.</i>

683
00:37:04,976 --> 00:37:07,945
I realize you might
have had a point.

684
00:37:08,013 --> 00:37:10,414
I've been alone a long time.

685
00:37:10,482 --> 00:37:13,517
And I don't want to
end up like House.

686
00:37:13,585 --> 00:37:16,020
What you said about me
and my marriage was...

687
00:37:16,088 --> 00:37:17,621
<i>i was being an ass.
True.</i>

688
00:37:17,689 --> 00:37:21,192
But you were right.

689
00:37:21,259 --> 00:37:23,994
I needed to hear it.

690
00:37:28,467 --> 00:37:30,768
So we're good.

691
00:37:30,836 --> 00:37:33,237
You know,
I have a couple tickets...

692
00:37:33,305 --> 00:37:35,139
don't push it.

693
00:37:40,345 --> 00:37:43,047
Taub and foreman done?
I'm hitching a ride with them.

694
00:37:43,115 --> 00:37:45,416
Me too.

695
00:37:45,484 --> 00:37:46,784
You're not picking up
your date?

696
00:37:46,852 --> 00:37:50,588
Naw. Going solo.

697
00:37:50,655 --> 00:37:53,023
All those meaningless
relationships

698
00:37:53,091 --> 00:37:54,492
tend to wear a guy out
after a while.

699
00:37:57,062 --> 00:37:58,662
<i>We've got 15
minutes to get there</i>

700
00:37:58,730 --> 00:38:00,131
if we wanna see the board freak

701
00:38:00,198 --> 00:38:01,866
when House's mariachi band
marches in.

702
00:38:41,072 --> 00:38:43,073
All of them are gone, Wilson.

703
00:38:45,677 --> 00:38:47,845
They're all dead because
I am screwed up.

704
00:38:50,382 --> 00:38:52,383
You lost one patient.

705
00:38:52,450 --> 00:38:54,485
And it wasn't your fault.

706
00:38:54,553 --> 00:38:58,656
What about that mom
who gave her baby cancer?

707
00:38:58,723 --> 00:39:01,058
If I'd figured that one
out quicker,

708
00:39:01,126 --> 00:39:04,361
she'd still be a mom alive.

709
00:39:04,429 --> 00:39:07,198
She refused treatment
when it was offered.

710
00:39:07,265 --> 00:39:09,967
How is that your fault?

711
00:39:10,035 --> 00:39:11,435
And there was that guy

712
00:39:11,503 --> 00:39:14,638
I spent a day trapped
in isolation with.

713
00:39:14,706 --> 00:39:17,374
He was five feet away
the whole time.

714
00:39:17,442 --> 00:39:20,544
Just watched him die
like an idiot.

715
00:39:20,612 --> 00:39:24,348
Yeah. You' lost patients
before,

716
00:39:24,416 --> 00:39:26,050
and you'll lose patients
again. Why...

717
00:39:26,117 --> 00:39:28,619
exactly! Why?

718
00:39:31,189 --> 00:39:35,392
Because love
and happiness are...

719
00:39:38,029 --> 00:39:39,997
Nothing but distractions.

720
00:39:43,235 --> 00:39:45,669
The only thing my relationship
with cuddy has done for me

721
00:39:45,737 --> 00:39:47,671
is make me a worse doctor.

722
00:39:49,374 --> 00:39:52,309
Right.
The great Dr. House

723
00:39:52,377 --> 00:39:54,211
doesn't deserve to be happy.

724
00:39:54,279 --> 00:39:56,046
You know it's not true.

725
00:39:56,114 --> 00:39:58,249
My happiness is being paid for

726
00:39:58,316 --> 00:40:00,184
by other people's lives.

727
00:40:06,024 --> 00:40:09,093
How is she?

728
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:11,562
She's worried.

729
00:40:11,630 --> 00:40:14,465
She's upset that you
didn't show up tonight.

730
00:40:22,540 --> 00:40:26,210
I gotta tell her
the truth, Wilson.

731
00:40:26,278 --> 00:40:28,545
First...First,

732
00:40:28,613 --> 00:40:29,880
you're not driving anywhere.

733
00:40:29,948 --> 00:40:31,482
And second,

734
00:40:31,549 --> 00:40:35,152
you are definitely not
talking to cuddy like this.

735
00:40:37,522 --> 00:40:38,956
Okay.

736
00:40:39,024 --> 00:40:41,125
I'm gonna walk.

737
00:41:05,183 --> 00:41:06,984
We really, really need to talk.

738
00:41:07,052 --> 00:41:09,553
You're drunk.
And you screwed up big time.

739
00:41:09,621 --> 00:41:11,622
Go home!

740
00:41:14,893 --> 00:41:16,393
You completely
disappeared on me.

741
00:41:16,461 --> 00:41:17,961
You wouldn't even answer
your cell phone.

742
00:41:18,029 --> 00:41:21,732
You're gonna want to...
Sit down for this.

743
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:23,567
Go ahead.

744
00:41:23,635 --> 00:41:24,768
Sit, sit, sit, sit, sit.

745
00:41:33,411 --> 00:41:38,515
I've made a decision.

746
00:41:38,583 --> 00:41:43,053
Being happy
and being in love with you...

747
00:41:43,121 --> 00:41:45,255
Makes me a crappy doctor.

748
00:41:46,891 --> 00:41:48,392
Shut up.

749
00:41:48,460 --> 00:41:51,628
You're too drunk
to end this relationship.

750
00:41:51,696 --> 00:41:53,464
I am drunk.

751
00:41:53,531 --> 00:41:55,499
And I'm also right.

752
00:41:55,567 --> 00:41:58,402
You have made me
a worse doctor.

753
00:41:58,470 --> 00:42:00,571
And people are gonna die
because of that.

754
00:42:05,410 --> 00:42:08,345
And...

755
00:42:08,413 --> 00:42:11,048
You...

756
00:42:11,116 --> 00:42:13,384
Are totally worth it.

757
00:42:18,456 --> 00:42:21,191
If I had to choose between...

758
00:42:22,694 --> 00:42:24,194
Saving everyone

759
00:42:24,262 --> 00:42:28,632
and loving you
and being happy...

760
00:42:28,700 --> 00:42:31,502
I choose you.

761
00:42:31,569 --> 00:42:33,771
<i>I choose being happy
with you.</i>

762
00:42:33,838 --> 00:42:37,040
I will always choose you.

763
00:42:42,180 --> 00:42:44,948
My head's on your vagina.

764
00:42:47,519 --> 00:42:50,287
Go to sleep, House.

765
00:42:50,355 --> 00:42:52,956
Yeah.
I am kinda tired.

766
