00:00:08,394 --> 00:00:11,329
<i>Three, two, one.</i>

2
00:00:11,332 --> 00:00:14,000
Yeah!

3
00:00:14,084 --> 00:00:15,335
Whoo!

4
00:00:17,755 --> 00:00:19,288
What do you want
to do next?

5
00:00:19,340 --> 00:00:23,125
Uh, swings?

6
00:00:23,177 --> 00:00:26,262
Okay.
Um, crawl tube?

7
00:00:26,313 --> 00:00:27,230
Nah.

8
00:00:27,297 --> 00:00:28,565
Nah?

9
00:00:28,632 --> 00:00:32,301
Well, I think we're running out
of options, honey.

10
00:00:32,353 --> 00:00:33,603
I want to go
on the merry-go-round.

11
00:00:33,654 --> 00:00:35,939
The m--
again?

12
00:00:35,990 --> 00:00:38,491
But this time
all by myself.

13
00:00:39,977 --> 00:00:41,644
Oh.

14
00:00:41,695 --> 00:00:42,912
I don't know,
jellybean.

15
00:00:42,980 --> 00:00:44,747
Daddy, I'm six.

16
00:00:44,815 --> 00:00:48,251
I'm not a baby anymore.

17
00:00:48,318 --> 00:00:49,919
Please?

18
00:00:54,491 --> 00:00:56,459
Thank you.

19
00:00:56,510 --> 00:00:57,760
You ready?
Uh-huh.

20
00:00:57,828 --> 00:00:59,629
All right.

21
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:00,847
Come here.

22
00:01:00,931 --> 00:01:02,832
I'll take beary.

23
00:01:02,883 --> 00:01:07,169
Mm. Now you promise you're
not gonna tell mommy, right?

24
00:01:07,221 --> 00:01:08,838
She'll kick my butt
if she finds out.

25
00:01:08,889 --> 00:01:12,942
Pinky swear.

26
00:01:13,010 --> 00:01:18,865
All right.
Go get 'em.

27
00:01:18,949 --> 00:01:21,234
Remember to hold on tight.
<i>I will.</i>

28
00:01:34,865 --> 00:01:42,639
? ?

29
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,851
Stop the ride!

30
00:02:28,919 --> 00:02:31,187
Emily!

31
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:35,608
Emily, where are you?

32
00:02:40,114 --> 00:02:42,065
<i>Em?</i>

33
00:02:43,233 --> 00:02:45,451
<i>Emily?</i>

34
00:02:45,536 --> 00:02:46,986
Emily?

35
00:02:47,071 --> 00:02:48,154
Emily, where are you,
honey?

36
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:54,293
Oh, Em.

37
00:02:54,378 --> 00:02:55,778
Emily.

38
00:02:55,829 --> 00:02:58,081
Honey?

39
00:03:00,134 --> 00:03:01,884
Help me!

42
00:03:10,002 --> 00:03:32,839
??

43
00:03:38,796 --> 00:03:43,483
Is that our precious little
bundle of tumor?

44
00:03:43,535 --> 00:03:46,152
They grow up so fast,
don't they?

45
00:03:46,204 --> 00:03:46,987
<i>How did you know</i>
<i>I was here?</i>

46
00:03:47,038 --> 00:03:49,373
How do you think?

47
00:03:49,457 --> 00:03:51,708
Foreman.

48
00:03:51,793 --> 00:03:53,326
Actually,
that would have been easier.

49
00:03:53,378 --> 00:03:54,545
No, I followed you.

50
00:03:54,629 --> 00:03:56,430
It didn't occur to you
that that might mean

51
00:03:56,497 --> 00:03:58,331
I don't want you involved
in my cancer treatment?

52
00:03:58,383 --> 00:03:59,850
I'm not here
as a doctor.

53
00:03:59,934 --> 00:04:01,885
I'm here as a towering pillar
of strength.

54
00:04:01,970 --> 00:04:03,470
Be a pillar
in the parking lot.

55
00:04:03,521 --> 00:04:04,938
No.

56
00:04:05,006 --> 00:04:06,473
<i>How many times</i>
<i>have I told you</i>

57
00:04:06,524 --> 00:04:09,109
I wanted to be alone and you've
made yourself a pain in the ass?

58
00:04:09,176 --> 00:04:10,394
I owe you.

59
00:04:13,815 --> 00:04:16,233
My word,
not a word.

60
00:04:18,236 --> 00:04:21,071
Realizing I'm most likely going
to regret this,

61
00:04:21,155 --> 00:04:23,373
all right.

62
00:04:35,553 --> 00:04:37,904
What--what are you doing?

63
00:04:37,972 --> 00:04:40,340
My best friend
has cancer.

64
00:04:40,391 --> 00:04:43,010
Cut me some slack.

65
00:04:43,061 --> 00:04:45,596
Also, spring break.

66
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,881
I'm on vacation.

67
00:04:47,932 --> 00:04:51,351
Although looking at you now, I
can tell the wet T-shirt contest

68
00:04:51,402 --> 00:04:53,403
is probably gonna suck.

69
00:04:57,275 --> 00:04:58,992
House taking time off

70
00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:00,577
is a bad sign.

71
00:05:00,662 --> 00:05:02,079
"A bad sign."

72
00:05:02,163 --> 00:05:03,864
You think the apocalypse
is coming

73
00:05:03,915 --> 00:05:06,166
because House wants
to be there for Wilson?

74
00:05:06,233 --> 00:05:07,167
Yes.

75
00:05:07,234 --> 00:05:09,569
You're new.

76
00:05:12,907 --> 00:05:14,875
We got a case.

77
00:05:14,926 --> 00:05:17,177
<i>Six-year-old</i>
<i>with a nosebleed</i>

78
00:05:17,244 --> 00:05:18,629
and breathing problems.

79
00:05:18,713 --> 00:05:20,631
She was born
with a rare mutation of A-T.

80
00:05:20,715 --> 00:05:24,217
Emily has a unique variant
on both of her ATM genes.

81
00:05:24,268 --> 00:05:27,020
Her disorder mimics A-T,
but not all of the symptoms.

82
00:05:27,088 --> 00:05:28,889
This is Dr. Elizabeth Lawson.

83
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:31,274
She's a developmental geneticist

84
00:05:31,359 --> 00:05:33,593
attached to JHU and an expert
on the girl's condition.

85
00:05:33,645 --> 00:05:37,263
Elizabeth Lawson.

86
00:05:37,315 --> 00:05:38,732
Emily Lawson.

87
00:05:38,783 --> 00:05:41,818
I'm here as a doctor,
not a mother.

88
00:05:47,375 --> 00:05:50,043
Nosebleeds and breathing
problems are common symptoms

89
00:05:50,111 --> 00:05:51,778
of ataxia telangiectasia.

90
00:05:51,829 --> 00:05:53,463
We could just be seeing

91
00:05:53,548 --> 00:05:54,798
<i>the natural progression--</i>
- It's not.

92
00:05:54,882 --> 00:05:56,800
A-T patients have
a life expectancy of 20 years.

93
00:05:56,884 --> 00:05:59,803
Emily is only six.
It's something else.

94
00:05:59,887 --> 00:06:01,838
I examined her lungs
two days ago.

95
00:06:01,923 --> 00:06:03,357
They're functioning normally.

96
00:06:03,424 --> 00:06:04,791
It says she fell off
a carousel.

97
00:06:04,842 --> 00:06:05,759
Head trauma--

98
00:06:05,810 --> 00:06:06,760
If the diagnosis was easy,

99
00:06:06,811 --> 00:06:10,013
I wouldn't need you people.

100
00:06:10,098 --> 00:06:13,016
I'm here because,
according to Eric,

101
00:06:13,101 --> 00:06:14,234
<i>you're the best.</i>

102
00:06:14,301 --> 00:06:15,602
<i>We are.</i>

103
00:06:15,653 --> 00:06:18,405
Have you considered
Wegener's granulomatosis?

104
00:06:19,824 --> 00:06:24,144
It's a good fit.

105
00:06:24,195 --> 00:06:25,662
But she can't have X-rays.

106
00:06:25,747 --> 00:06:28,198
<i>A-T makes her hypersensitive</i>
<i>to ionizing radiation.</i>

107
00:06:28,282 --> 00:06:30,367
I'll get her prepped
for an MRI.

108
00:06:34,288 --> 00:06:36,489
She knows more about
her daughter's genetic condition

109
00:06:36,541 --> 00:06:37,958
than any of you.

110
00:06:38,009 --> 00:06:40,177
She'll be an asset.

111
00:06:40,261 --> 00:06:41,327
<i>Or she won't,</i>

112
00:06:41,379 --> 00:06:44,181
Eric.

113
00:06:44,265 --> 00:06:45,215
This isn't a request.

114
00:06:45,299 --> 00:06:46,733
Use her.

115
00:06:51,105 --> 00:06:53,840
The tumor's spread
to the surrounding tissue.

116
00:06:53,908 --> 00:06:55,475
We're gonna have
to shrink it

117
00:06:55,543 --> 00:06:56,443
before we remove it
surgically.

118
00:06:56,510 --> 00:06:58,028
I'm more interested

119
00:06:58,112 --> 00:07:00,981
in exactly how you plan
to do that, Mike.

120
00:07:01,032 --> 00:07:02,482
We start conservative.

121
00:07:02,533 --> 00:07:04,651
Daily radiation treatments
for three weeks.

122
00:07:04,702 --> 00:07:06,536
And, if it doesn't shrink enough
after that,

123
00:07:06,621 --> 00:07:08,422
we'll add the chemo--

124
00:07:08,489 --> 00:07:11,258
And, if it hasn't shrunk enough
after that, I'm dead.

125
00:07:15,329 --> 00:07:17,531
Look, you have
over a 75% chance

126
00:07:17,598 --> 00:07:19,099
that the radiation alone
is enough.

127
00:07:19,167 --> 00:07:20,083
Relax.

128
00:07:20,168 --> 00:07:21,384
Caught this in time.

129
00:07:21,469 --> 00:07:22,769
Catching it in time
would have been

130
00:07:22,837 --> 00:07:25,572
before it invaded the tissue
around my thymus.

131
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:27,674
I want the radiation
and the chemo concurrently.

132
00:07:27,742 --> 00:07:31,228
Why stress your immune system
unnecessarily?

133
00:07:31,312 --> 00:07:32,879
Let's just go
with my plan, okay?

134
00:07:32,930 --> 00:07:34,765
The radiation first--
I'm gonna get a second opinion.

135
00:07:34,849 --> 00:07:36,600
Are you serious?

136
00:07:36,684 --> 00:07:39,152
Look, I've seen you recommend
this exact treatment

137
00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:41,054
dozens of times.
We're done here.

138
00:07:41,105 --> 00:07:42,856
I'll look for a doctor
with some actual balls.

139
00:07:47,161 --> 00:07:49,863
Hey, you need
to talk to your friend.

140
00:07:49,914 --> 00:07:51,414
<i>He's embarrassing himself.</i>

141
00:07:51,499 --> 00:07:53,633
A doctor should be able
to handle his own illness

142
00:07:53,701 --> 00:07:54,668
<i>with a little bit</i>
<i>more dignity.</i>

143
00:07:54,735 --> 00:07:56,369
I agree with Wilson.

144
00:07:56,420 --> 00:07:57,954
My recommended treatment
is sound.

145
00:07:58,039 --> 00:07:59,422
No, I meant
about the ball-less part.

146
00:07:59,507 --> 00:08:01,241
Explains the office.

147
00:08:03,961 --> 00:08:06,246
<i>It was a merry-go-round.</i>

148
00:08:06,297 --> 00:08:07,798
She's a kid, Liz.
We were having fun.

149
00:08:07,882 --> 00:08:09,015
You should try it sometime.

150
00:08:09,083 --> 00:08:11,134
Fun?
She's six, not you.

151
00:08:11,219 --> 00:08:12,719
You know
she has balance issues.

152
00:08:12,770 --> 00:08:15,939
I know that she's--

153
00:08:16,023 --> 00:08:19,309
This is Emily's father,
Simon.

154
00:08:19,393 --> 00:08:21,228
He was with her
when the symptoms occurred.

155
00:08:21,279 --> 00:08:23,530
I had her all week.
She was fine.

156
00:08:23,597 --> 00:08:25,115
We could come back.

157
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:27,767
No need.
Patient's ready for transport.

158
00:08:30,204 --> 00:08:31,938
Wake up,
sleepy head.

159
00:08:38,663 --> 00:08:40,280
<i>I saw it</i>
<i>in the gift shop.</i>

160
00:08:40,331 --> 00:08:42,716
I know
how much you like them.

161
00:08:42,783 --> 00:08:44,301
Thanks.

162
00:08:44,385 --> 00:08:47,087
They're gonna take you
for an MRI now.

163
00:08:47,138 --> 00:08:50,974
It means
"magic really cool images."

164
00:08:51,058 --> 00:08:55,161
I thought it stood for
"magnetic resonance imaging."

165
00:08:56,898 --> 00:08:58,515
We've spent a lot
of time in hospitals.

166
00:09:02,103 --> 00:09:03,720
B-9.

167
00:09:07,474 --> 00:09:09,659
- Hit.
And I hate you.

168
00:09:12,864 --> 00:09:15,882
Ugh.
I'm done.

169
00:09:15,950 --> 00:09:17,483
I sunk your battleship?

170
00:09:17,535 --> 00:09:20,153
No.
But I think I'm gonna puke.

171
00:09:20,204 --> 00:09:22,756
Good. Now that you're
sufficiently buzzed,

172
00:09:22,823 --> 00:09:25,825
what was the reason behind you
freaking out on Kondo?

173
00:09:25,893 --> 00:09:27,627
Are you scared?

174
00:09:27,678 --> 00:09:29,145
Are you in denial?

175
00:09:29,213 --> 00:09:30,547
I know you get confused

176
00:09:30,631 --> 00:09:32,999
any time someone thinks
that you're wrong,

177
00:09:33,050 --> 00:09:34,500
but it's not considered
freaking out

178
00:09:34,552 --> 00:09:36,353
for a patient to ask
for a second opinion.

179
00:09:36,437 --> 00:09:37,938
Okay, well,
here it is.

180
00:09:38,005 --> 00:09:39,723
Kondo is right.

181
00:09:39,807 --> 00:09:41,224
You should be
in radiology right now.

182
00:09:41,309 --> 00:09:42,525
Well done.

183
00:09:42,610 --> 00:09:44,811
You've kept your word
for almost two hours.

184
00:09:44,862 --> 00:09:46,196
Every day you wait,

185
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:49,182
our pal toomie
is growing larger in your chest.

186
00:09:49,233 --> 00:09:50,700
If you want to live,

187
00:09:50,785 --> 00:09:52,452
stop screwing around
and do something about it.

188
00:09:52,519 --> 00:09:55,121
Good idea.

189
00:09:55,189 --> 00:09:56,239
I think

190
00:09:56,324 --> 00:09:59,359
I'll start
with spending spring break

191
00:09:59,427 --> 00:10:02,329
on my own.

192
00:10:06,550 --> 00:10:08,752
How you feeling
in there, Emily?

193
00:10:08,836 --> 00:10:09,936
<i>Good, I guess.</i>

194
00:10:10,004 --> 00:10:13,506
Is something wrong?

195
00:10:13,557 --> 00:10:17,711
I was only pretending
to be asleep.

196
00:10:17,778 --> 00:10:19,913
<i>You think</i>
<i>that's dishonest?</i>

197
00:10:19,964 --> 00:10:23,282
Uh, that's--

198
00:10:23,334 --> 00:10:24,784
My daughters do that too.

199
00:10:24,852 --> 00:10:27,003
But they know that sometimes,
when it seems

200
00:10:27,088 --> 00:10:28,888
like mommy and daddy
are fighting, it's really

201
00:10:28,956 --> 00:10:31,091
only because they're worried
about you.

202
00:10:34,395 --> 00:10:36,663
And does your wife
ever want a divorce?

203
00:10:39,266 --> 00:10:41,300
No.
Everything's fine at home.

204
00:10:41,352 --> 00:10:43,737
Hold still now.
No more talking.

205
00:10:47,658 --> 00:10:49,308
What do you think
of her mother?

206
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:53,479
She called her daughter
"the patient".

207
00:10:53,531 --> 00:10:58,585
If my kids were born
with an expiration date,

208
00:10:58,652 --> 00:11:01,538
- I don't--
- <i>Ow!</i>

209
00:11:01,622 --> 00:11:05,091
Ow!

210
00:11:05,159 --> 00:11:06,676
Ow-ee!

211
00:11:06,761 --> 00:11:07,994
Where does it hurt?

212
00:11:08,045 --> 00:11:11,431
I want my daddy.
Where's my daddy?

213
00:11:11,498 --> 00:11:14,434
Ow!

214
00:11:14,501 --> 00:11:16,102
Ow!

215
00:11:17,751 --> 00:11:19,901
We were able to restore
circulation to her hands

216
00:11:19,902 --> 00:11:22,186
and feet before
any permanent damage set in.

217
00:11:22,237 --> 00:11:23,537
Primary Raynaud's?

218
00:11:23,622 --> 00:11:26,624
The cold inside the MRI room
could have set it off.

219
00:11:26,691 --> 00:11:28,626
Stress can also precipitate
the condition.

220
00:11:28,693 --> 00:11:30,294
She's shown no evidence
of cold sensitivity,

221
00:11:30,362 --> 00:11:32,580
and she has no problems
with MRI machines.

222
00:11:32,664 --> 00:11:34,882
<i>There are other kinds</i>
<i>of stress.</i>

223
00:11:34,967 --> 00:11:37,051
She heard you and your husband
fighting.

224
00:11:37,135 --> 00:11:40,471
Unfortunately, she's heard
a lot worse than that before.

225
00:11:40,538 --> 00:11:41,923
<i>It's not stress.</i>

226
00:11:42,007 --> 00:11:45,810
Could be
secondary Raynaud's.

227
00:11:45,877 --> 00:11:47,061
<i>Lupus is consistent</i>
<i>with Emily's symptoms.</i>

228
00:11:47,145 --> 00:11:48,095
<i>Her lymph nodes</i>
<i>aren't enlarged,</i>

229
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:50,014
and she has shown
no signs

230
00:11:50,065 --> 00:11:55,486
of immune activation.

231
00:11:55,554 --> 00:11:56,787
It could be
heavy metal poisoning.

232
00:11:56,855 --> 00:11:58,906
From what?
The carousel?

233
00:11:58,991 --> 00:12:00,574
<i>She was only on it</i>
<i>for a minute.</i>

234
00:12:00,659 --> 00:12:02,944
Simon moved
into an old apartment building

235
00:12:03,028 --> 00:12:04,111
three weeks ago.

236
00:12:04,196 --> 00:12:05,496
<i>I'm sure he has no idea</i>

237
00:12:05,564 --> 00:12:06,697
what the insulation's made of,

238
00:12:06,748 --> 00:12:08,565
what kind of paint.

239
00:12:08,617 --> 00:12:11,002
He's a good father,

240
00:12:11,069 --> 00:12:12,620
but when it comes
to Emily's health--

241
00:12:12,704 --> 00:12:14,271
<i>I'm gonna get his keys</i>

242
00:12:14,339 --> 00:12:15,739
<i>and check</i>
<i>for environmentals.</i>

243
00:12:15,791 --> 00:12:17,708
Lupus is a better fit.

244
00:12:17,759 --> 00:12:18,709
I don't mean
to pull rank here,

245
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:21,045
but I am her mother.

246
00:12:21,096 --> 00:12:22,930
I thought you said
you were here as a doctor.

247
00:12:23,015 --> 00:12:24,882
And as a doctor,
I need parental consent.

248
00:12:24,933 --> 00:12:25,916
See above.

249
00:12:25,984 --> 00:12:27,418
<i>While I'm gone,</i>

250
00:12:27,469 --> 00:12:31,539
please start her
on Chelation Therapy.

251
00:12:31,606 --> 00:12:33,674
She's the mother.

252
00:12:33,742 --> 00:12:36,877
So let's treat her
like any other mother.

253
00:12:42,067 --> 00:12:45,619
I think we just hit
the environmental mother lode.

254
00:12:48,957 --> 00:12:50,774
Funny she never mentioned
an entire basement

255
00:12:50,826 --> 00:12:54,328
full of dangerous chemicals
and drugs.

256
00:12:54,413 --> 00:12:56,447
You think she'd even let Emily
down here?

257
00:12:56,498 --> 00:12:59,083
Yeah.

258
00:12:59,134 --> 00:13:02,286
Apparently a lot.

259
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:15,733
You ever heard of Lex-2?

260
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:17,134
Read about it.

261
00:13:17,185 --> 00:13:21,739
It's an experimental
aminoglycoside antibiotic.

262
00:13:21,807 --> 00:13:26,944
Supposedly it can override
DNA errors in the ATM gene.

263
00:13:26,995 --> 00:13:29,813
Doesn't mean she's giving it
to her daughter.

264
00:13:29,865 --> 00:13:32,850
Anyone studying A-T
would be researching it.

265
00:13:32,918 --> 00:13:34,869
How?

266
00:13:34,953 --> 00:13:38,589
You see any lab rats
down here?

267
00:13:38,656 --> 00:13:40,491
The only cage I see
is right there.

268
00:13:50,535 --> 00:13:51,702
Go away.

269
00:13:51,770 --> 00:13:55,005
I have a headache.

270
00:13:55,057 --> 00:13:58,609
We don't have
to have sex.

271
00:13:58,676 --> 00:14:03,614
Sometimes it's nice
just to cuddle and talk.

272
00:14:03,681 --> 00:14:05,399
Me first.

273
00:14:05,484 --> 00:14:08,185
You don't want
a second opinion.

274
00:14:08,236 --> 00:14:10,254
You're already
on your fifth.

275
00:14:10,322 --> 00:14:12,757
<i>You got Evans at Mercy,</i>
<i>Shaw at County,</i>

276
00:14:12,824 --> 00:14:14,358
Foster at Johns Hopkins.

277
00:14:14,426 --> 00:14:17,661
And every one of them
has given you the same advice.

278
00:14:17,712 --> 00:14:19,747
You're nuts.

279
00:14:19,831 --> 00:14:21,999
You don't just want chemo.

280
00:14:22,050 --> 00:14:24,335
You want a dose so high,

281
00:14:24,386 --> 00:14:27,871
there's a one-in-three chance
it'll kill you outright.

282
00:14:30,092 --> 00:14:31,909
Question is,

283
00:14:31,977 --> 00:14:35,429
why didn't you tell me?

284
00:14:35,514 --> 00:14:38,182
Because you knew
I'd stop you.

285
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:40,417
<i>Which means</i>
<i>you've already found someone</i>

286
00:14:40,485 --> 00:14:42,153
<i>insane enough</i>

287
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:44,021
or desperate enough

288
00:14:44,072 --> 00:14:47,441
to give you what amounts
to a death dose of chemicals.

289
00:14:47,526 --> 00:14:52,113
But who would be that stupid?

290
00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:55,199
I'm thinking that the who
is you.

291
00:15:13,602 --> 00:15:16,137
Where exactly
were you planning

292
00:15:16,221 --> 00:15:18,155
on killing yourself?

293
00:15:18,223 --> 00:15:22,059
'Cause I don't think Foreman
is gonna let you do it here.

294
00:15:24,529 --> 00:15:25,779
My place.

295
00:15:25,864 --> 00:15:28,399
I've been stockpiling equipment.
No.

296
00:15:28,450 --> 00:15:31,468
No!
Stop.

297
00:15:37,942 --> 00:15:39,610
I'm still healthy.

298
00:15:39,678 --> 00:15:42,630
Why not go the extreme route now
when there's a better chance

299
00:15:42,714 --> 00:15:44,048
of surviving it?

300
00:15:44,115 --> 00:15:46,383
Statistically,

301
00:15:46,451 --> 00:15:48,302
this treatment
has about the same chance

302
00:15:48,386 --> 00:15:50,354
of killing you
as the thymoma does.

303
00:15:50,422 --> 00:15:53,290
But a hell of a lot faster.

304
00:16:03,018 --> 00:16:04,735
Nancy Wells,
cervical cancer,

305
00:16:04,802 --> 00:16:06,353
70% survival rate.

306
00:16:06,438 --> 00:16:09,273
Died November 6, 1998,

307
00:16:09,324 --> 00:16:11,492
64 years old.

308
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:15,479
Bernie Jones, melanoma,

309
00:16:15,530 --> 00:16:17,648
89% survival rate.

310
00:16:17,699 --> 00:16:19,650
October 10, 1999.

311
00:16:19,701 --> 00:16:21,168
He was 52.

312
00:16:24,923 --> 00:16:26,674
John Taylor.

313
00:16:26,758 --> 00:16:27,925
Thyroid.

314
00:16:27,992 --> 00:16:32,846
96% survival rate.

315
00:16:32,931 --> 00:16:36,183
I promised him
he'd be fine.

316
00:16:36,268 --> 00:16:39,186
Eight years old.

317
00:16:42,724 --> 00:16:44,942
I am not going
to die slowly

318
00:16:45,009 --> 00:16:47,311
in a hospital bed
under fluorescent lighting

319
00:16:47,362 --> 00:16:48,679
with people stopping by
to gawk

320
00:16:48,730 --> 00:16:50,531
and lie
about how I look.

321
00:16:50,615 --> 00:16:52,066
Even a small chance
of that happening

322
00:16:52,150 --> 00:16:54,518
is too big a chance
for me.

323
00:17:01,710 --> 00:17:05,462
You're an idiot.

324
00:17:05,530 --> 00:17:09,833
And the odds say
you're gonna die.

325
00:17:15,257 --> 00:17:17,958
We'll do it at my place.

326
00:17:27,236 --> 00:17:29,247
The only environmental factors
we think

327
00:17:29,248 --> 00:17:30,748
caused your daughter's illness
are the ones

328
00:17:30,833 --> 00:17:32,100
you shot her full of.

329
00:17:32,167 --> 00:17:34,039
I tested the drug.
This is what I did

330
00:17:34,042 --> 00:17:36,360
for a living
for ten years.

331
00:17:36,411 --> 00:17:37,911
She's your child,
not a Guinea pig.

332
00:17:37,996 --> 00:17:40,280
I tested it first.

333
00:17:40,365 --> 00:17:42,699
On myself.

334
00:17:42,767 --> 00:17:45,602
And in six months,
I didn't document

335
00:17:45,670 --> 00:17:47,170
any adverse effects.

336
00:17:47,238 --> 00:17:49,840
A trial of one
is basically irrelevant.

337
00:17:53,294 --> 00:17:55,962
Respiratory infections
are common with A-T.

338
00:17:56,047 --> 00:17:58,298
With Emily's mutation,
they are deadly,

339
00:17:58,383 --> 00:18:00,133
and they get worse
every year.

340
00:18:00,218 --> 00:18:04,438
Lex-2 won't be approved for
at least the next five years.

341
00:18:04,522 --> 00:18:06,306
Emily, on the other hand,

342
00:18:06,391 --> 00:18:10,110
wouldn't have survived
the winter.

343
00:18:10,194 --> 00:18:15,165
What was I supposed to do?

344
00:18:15,233 --> 00:18:19,453
There's a reason
for FDA requirements.

345
00:18:19,537 --> 00:18:21,071
A study
at Jackson Memorial--

346
00:18:21,122 --> 00:18:22,322
I know
about Gaines' research.

347
00:18:22,407 --> 00:18:23,657
He's publishing next month.

348
00:18:23,741 --> 00:18:25,008
Was.
I just spoke to him.

349
00:18:25,076 --> 00:18:27,377
His team just linked
the use of Lex-2

350
00:18:27,445 --> 00:18:29,579
to renal failure
in mice and rats.

351
00:18:34,552 --> 00:18:37,587
<i>She needs an</i>
<i>ultrasound guided renal biopsy</i>

352
00:18:37,638 --> 00:18:39,806
to check the damage.

353
00:18:39,891 --> 00:18:41,091
Hopefully
it's reversible.

354
00:18:51,302 --> 00:18:59,076
? ?

355
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:17,210
To stupidity.

356
00:19:17,295 --> 00:19:20,330
<i>Mm, not quite done.</i>

357
00:19:20,381 --> 00:19:23,666
To muscle aches,
spasms.

358
00:19:23,718 --> 00:19:25,502
To your joints feeling
like they're being ripped out

359
00:19:25,553 --> 00:19:27,504
and replaced with shards
of broken glass.

360
00:19:27,555 --> 00:19:30,190
Should I be writing
any of this down?

361
00:19:30,274 --> 00:19:32,175
<i>Your stomach</i>
<i>fills with bile.</i>

362
00:19:32,226 --> 00:19:33,944
When you vomit,
it feels like someone's forcing

363
00:19:34,011 --> 00:19:36,079
a white hot hammer
down your esophagus,

364
00:19:36,147 --> 00:19:37,647
<i>tearing your flesh.</i>

365
00:19:37,698 --> 00:19:39,199
<i>Blood's dripping</i>
<i>down the back of your throat,</i>

366
00:19:39,283 --> 00:19:40,817
choking and gagging you

367
00:19:40,868 --> 00:19:43,420
with the slick, coppery taste
of burnt pennies.

368
00:19:43,488 --> 00:19:45,872
I am an Oncologist.
I know--

369
00:19:45,957 --> 00:19:48,525
If you did,
we wouldn't be sitting here.

370
00:19:48,576 --> 00:19:52,395
Day two: Your white blood cells
are gone,

371
00:19:52,463 --> 00:19:53,880
<i>opening up your system</i>
<i>to attack.</i>

372
00:19:53,965 --> 00:19:55,415
Your temperature skyrockets.

373
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:57,584
One second, your skin feels
like it's on fire.

374
00:19:57,668 --> 00:19:59,586
The next second,
it's entombed in ice.

375
00:19:59,670 --> 00:20:02,572
Every pain sensor in your body
is firing at the same time

376
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:05,775
<i>until agony isn't even a word</i>
<i>or a concept--</i>

377
00:20:05,843 --> 00:20:07,611
<i>it's your only reality.</i>

378
00:20:07,678 --> 00:20:09,062
You hallucinate.

379
00:20:09,147 --> 00:20:11,298
You dream of death.

380
00:20:11,365 --> 00:20:14,835
<i>And then the race begins.</i>

381
00:20:14,902 --> 00:20:17,137
<i>Can your body claw</i>
<i>its way back in time</i>

382
00:20:17,205 --> 00:20:19,673
<i>before the hostile organisms</i>
<i>and parasites</i>

383
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:21,224
<i>claim you permanently?</i>

384
00:20:21,275 --> 00:20:25,729
Win, you live.
Lose, you die.

385
00:20:33,454 --> 00:20:37,274
Now what are we doing here,
Wilson?

386
00:20:51,489 --> 00:20:54,691
Kidney number one looks good.

387
00:20:54,758 --> 00:20:58,195
Which means we'll probably take
the biopsy from two.

388
00:20:58,262 --> 00:21:01,064
Hey,
you're doing great.

389
00:21:01,115 --> 00:21:04,017
Brave as always.

390
00:21:06,437 --> 00:21:08,788
Pretty cool, eh?

391
00:21:08,873 --> 00:21:14,277
You want to try?

392
00:21:14,328 --> 00:21:15,996
<i>What's wrong?</i>

393
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:18,331
My chest hurts.

394
00:21:21,836 --> 00:21:24,454
It's definitely
not her kidneys.

395
00:21:24,505 --> 00:21:26,473
It's okay.

396
00:21:31,512 --> 00:21:33,263
Promise this'll taste
just as good coming up

397
00:21:33,314 --> 00:21:35,649
as it did going down.

398
00:21:42,773 --> 00:21:44,357
If things go wrong,

399
00:21:44,442 --> 00:21:46,409
<i>I just want you</i>
<i>to know--</i>

400
00:21:46,477 --> 00:21:50,330
If you're gonna say that you've
always been secretly gay for me,

401
00:21:50,414 --> 00:21:52,082
everyone always
just kind of assumed it.

402
00:21:52,149 --> 00:21:55,652
I just want you to know...

403
00:21:55,720 --> 00:22:00,340
That I appreciate the risk
you're taking...

404
00:22:00,424 --> 00:22:02,676
Pumping a human being
full of lethal chemicals

405
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:04,261
in your living room.

406
00:22:04,328 --> 00:22:06,246
If I die,
it probably won't go over well

407
00:22:06,314 --> 00:22:08,048
with your probation officer.

408
00:22:08,132 --> 00:22:10,300
That's not gonna
be an issue.

409
00:22:10,351 --> 00:22:12,969
I'm glad at least one of us
is confident.

410
00:22:13,037 --> 00:22:14,004
<i>Not me.</i>

411
00:22:14,071 --> 00:22:15,605
I've already identified

412
00:22:15,673 --> 00:22:16,973
a couple of spots
to dump your body

413
00:22:17,041 --> 00:22:19,342
if this goes south.

414
00:22:19,410 --> 00:22:22,445
I've always enjoyed
Trinity Park.

415
00:22:22,513 --> 00:22:26,032
It does have a nice access
to the lake.

416
00:22:26,117 --> 00:22:28,702
<i>Muscle spasms already?</i>

417
00:22:28,786 --> 00:22:31,037
No.
It's nothing really.

418
00:22:31,122 --> 00:22:33,957
Good news.

419
00:22:34,025 --> 00:22:35,592
Takes most people two bags

420
00:22:35,660 --> 00:22:37,410
to get to that stage.

421
00:22:37,495 --> 00:22:40,664
You're way ahead of schedule.

422
00:22:44,678 --> 00:22:45,945
<i>You'll think it's stupid.</i>

423
00:22:46,524 --> 00:22:47,907
<i>That hasn't stopped you before.</i>

424
00:22:47,975 --> 00:22:51,194
I just always thought,

425
00:22:51,278 --> 00:22:54,280
when I got old or sick,

426
00:22:54,332 --> 00:22:59,619
I'd have a wife or kids
to look after me.

427
00:22:59,687 --> 00:23:01,454
<i>And in this scenario,</i>

428
00:23:01,522 --> 00:23:03,173
<i>are your loving wife and kids</i>

429
00:23:03,257 --> 00:23:05,992
holding the life support cord,

430
00:23:06,043 --> 00:23:09,429
<i>or are they thumbing</i>
<i>through your will?</i>

431
00:23:09,496 --> 00:23:11,765
I'm in it, right?

432
00:23:11,832 --> 00:23:14,267
Mm.

433
00:23:14,334 --> 00:23:17,137
You have everything you need
right here.

434
00:23:17,204 --> 00:23:19,305
We both do.

435
00:23:23,210 --> 00:23:24,644
Painkiller.

436
00:23:24,712 --> 00:23:26,780
<i>Industrial strength.</i>

437
00:23:26,847 --> 00:23:30,683
Level: Awesome.

438
00:23:38,192 --> 00:23:40,359
We're on vacation.

439
00:23:47,034 --> 00:23:48,902
That is nice.

440
00:23:55,810 --> 00:23:57,143
<i>Her kidneys are fine.</i>

441
00:23:57,211 --> 00:23:58,311
I don't think
we're looking at side effects

442
00:23:58,378 --> 00:23:59,596
from the Lex-2.

443
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:00,980
She's prone
to respiratory infection.

444
00:24:01,048 --> 00:24:02,816
- Pneumonia?
- No persistent cough,

445
00:24:02,883 --> 00:24:04,184
chills, or excess sweating.

446
00:24:04,251 --> 00:24:05,685
What about a pulmonary embolism?

447
00:24:05,736 --> 00:24:07,020
Fits coughing up blood,
but a clot?

448
00:24:07,071 --> 00:24:08,387
From what?

449
00:24:08,439 --> 00:24:09,522
Bruising from when she fell
off the carousel.

450
00:24:09,573 --> 00:24:11,991
<i>Contusion damages a deep vein,</i>

451
00:24:12,059 --> 00:24:13,276
causes a clot.

452
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:14,828
A piece breaks off,
travels to her lungs.

453
00:24:14,895 --> 00:24:16,913
We need to get her
on heparin now.

454
00:24:16,997 --> 00:24:19,249
Another embolism could cause
a heart attack

455
00:24:19,333 --> 00:24:20,399
or a stroke.

456
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:24,737
What's wrong?
Is it Emily?

457
00:24:24,789 --> 00:24:26,456
Sort of.

458
00:24:26,540 --> 00:24:29,175
<i>You can't do this.</i>

459
00:24:29,243 --> 00:24:31,244
I'm taking her to Mercy.

460
00:24:31,295 --> 00:24:33,096
Everything you people have done
has just made her worse.

461
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:35,014
You don't have the right.
We have joint custody.

462
00:24:35,082 --> 00:24:36,216
Where was my right
when you were treating

463
00:24:36,267 --> 00:24:37,183
our daughter
like a lab rat?

464
00:24:37,251 --> 00:24:38,301
She'd be dead
if I hadn't.

465
00:24:38,385 --> 00:24:41,471
Stop it.

466
00:24:41,555 --> 00:24:43,422
Your daughter deserves
better than this.

467
00:24:46,694 --> 00:24:48,978
It's okay, sweetie.

468
00:24:49,063 --> 00:24:50,864
Mommy and I
are just gonna talk.

469
00:24:50,931 --> 00:24:52,949
<i>Okay?</i>

470
00:24:53,033 --> 00:24:54,300
You want to get
some candy?

471
00:25:01,575 --> 00:25:04,610
We believe Emily has a clot
in her lungs.

472
00:25:04,662 --> 00:25:06,162
If you leave now,
she could die

473
00:25:06,247 --> 00:25:07,964
before her new doctors
are even up to speed.

474
00:25:08,048 --> 00:25:09,782
From her A-T?

475
00:25:09,834 --> 00:25:11,718
From the fall
off the carousel.

476
00:25:22,429 --> 00:25:24,463
Now can we just stop blaming
each other

477
00:25:24,515 --> 00:25:25,849
and do the right thing here?

478
00:25:25,933 --> 00:25:27,233
You're really gonna equate
the two?

479
00:25:27,301 --> 00:25:30,770
No, you were giving her
two minutes of fun.

480
00:25:30,821 --> 00:25:33,189
I was trying
to save her life.

481
00:25:33,274 --> 00:25:35,925
What's her best friend's name?

482
00:25:36,010 --> 00:25:38,678
What's the name
of her favorite teacher?

483
00:25:38,745 --> 00:25:42,182
Why does she hate that
stuffed animal you gave her?

484
00:25:42,249 --> 00:25:44,968
She's been having nightmares
about penguins all month.

485
00:25:49,940 --> 00:25:51,274
What's her blood type?

486
00:25:55,863 --> 00:25:59,148
Rh factor?
Her serum immunoglobulin levels?

487
00:25:59,233 --> 00:26:01,034
I don't care.
Those are letters and numbers.

488
00:26:01,101 --> 00:26:02,452
- That's not her.
- What about the variant

489
00:26:02,536 --> 00:26:06,706
in her e14 ATM intergenic
promoter region?

490
00:26:06,773 --> 00:26:10,493
Because that's what's killing
your daughter.

491
00:26:10,578 --> 00:26:15,048
Unless I can find a way
to reactivate it.

492
00:26:20,387 --> 00:26:22,955
Just make her better.

493
00:26:50,534 --> 00:26:53,036
<i>You don't look too good,</i>
<i>mister.</i>

494
00:27:06,767 --> 00:27:08,401
How did you get in here?

495
00:27:08,469 --> 00:27:09,869
The door.

496
00:27:09,937 --> 00:27:11,738
Are you, like, sick
or something?

497
00:27:11,805 --> 00:27:14,807
Where's House?

498
00:27:14,858 --> 00:27:16,743
Where are your parents?

499
00:27:22,232 --> 00:27:25,618
Oh, I know you.
You live in the building, right?

500
00:27:25,686 --> 00:27:27,754
<i>What's your name?</i>

501
00:27:27,821 --> 00:27:30,790
You don't remember?

502
00:27:30,857 --> 00:27:34,327
House.

503
00:27:45,306 --> 00:27:47,473
You promised me
I'd go home again, Dr. Wilson.

504
00:27:49,843 --> 00:27:52,045
You said it wasn't my fault.

505
00:27:54,315 --> 00:27:56,683
It wasn't, John.

506
00:27:56,750 --> 00:27:59,419
If I didn't do nothing wrong,

507
00:27:59,486 --> 00:28:01,421
why did I die?

508
00:28:01,488 --> 00:28:03,556
<i>I don't know.</i>

509
00:28:07,745 --> 00:28:09,779
Look...

510
00:28:09,863 --> 00:28:12,065
I shouldn't have done this.

511
00:28:18,706 --> 00:28:20,440
Am I dead?

512
00:28:22,810 --> 00:28:24,711
Not yet.

513
00:28:24,762 --> 00:28:27,814
It just feels that way.

514
00:28:27,881 --> 00:28:29,449
Are you okay?

515
00:28:29,516 --> 00:28:33,052
I mean, apart from the pain,
vomiting, diarrhea, and cramps?

516
00:28:50,471 --> 00:28:52,171
<i>I worked six months</i>
<i>in a research lab</i>

517
00:28:52,239 --> 00:28:53,373
<i>after med school.</i>

518
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:56,075
You get so focused.

519
00:28:56,126 --> 00:28:59,145
Once I didn't eat
for two days.

520
00:28:59,213 --> 00:29:02,615
It's easy to forget
what actually matters.

521
00:29:02,683 --> 00:29:04,417
I didn't.

522
00:29:04,485 --> 00:29:09,522
Yeah, it sucks
I got her the wrong doll, but...

523
00:29:09,590 --> 00:29:11,924
Good news.

524
00:29:11,975 --> 00:29:13,626
Emily's lungs
are clear.

525
00:29:13,677 --> 00:29:15,645
No clot.
And bad news.

526
00:29:15,729 --> 00:29:17,346
We still don't know
what's happening to her.

527
00:29:17,431 --> 00:29:18,848
Whatever it is,
there's liver involvement.

528
00:29:18,932 --> 00:29:21,100
Her eyes are jaundiced.

529
00:29:21,151 --> 00:29:23,686
<i>Her liver's failing.</i>

530
00:29:25,871 --> 00:29:27,842
<i>We found a blockage</i>
<i>in her hepatic vein,</i>

531
00:29:27,843 --> 00:29:29,922
<i>which is restricting blood flow</i>
<i>to her liver.</i>

532
00:29:30,022 --> 00:29:31,288
<i>Polycythemia vera?</i>

533
00:29:31,356 --> 00:29:32,773
<i>Red blood counts are normal.</i>

534
00:29:32,841 --> 00:29:35,359
<i>Could be some sort</i>
<i>of connective tissue disorder.</i>

535
00:29:35,444 --> 00:29:38,145
What if--

536
00:29:38,196 --> 00:29:41,282
what if we're just seeing
the end result

537
00:29:41,349 --> 00:29:44,351
<i>of her condition?</i>

538
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:48,064
She's unique.

539
00:29:48,132 --> 00:29:52,185
One screwed-up gene
from each of us.

540
00:29:54,062 --> 00:29:55,746
<i>Let's stick with our process.</i>

541
00:29:55,814 --> 00:29:58,766
I shouldn't be here.

542
00:30:05,607 --> 00:30:08,025
<i>What are we missing?</i>

543
00:30:08,109 --> 00:30:09,576
Advanced Lyme disease.

544
00:30:09,644 --> 00:30:11,578
Would have seen it
in the blood.

545
00:30:11,646 --> 00:30:13,280
He said advanced.

546
00:30:13,331 --> 00:30:14,314
We wouldn't pick it up
in her blood

547
00:30:14,366 --> 00:30:15,282
if it's in her organs

548
00:30:15,333 --> 00:30:16,483
and nervous system now.

549
00:30:16,534 --> 00:30:18,002
It fits everything
but the nosebleed.

550
00:30:18,086 --> 00:30:20,871
But why is it attacking now,
all at once?

551
00:30:20,955 --> 00:30:22,623
What's changed?

552
00:30:22,674 --> 00:30:25,125
Elizabeth has.

553
00:30:25,193 --> 00:30:28,062
<i>She stopped giving Emily</i>
<i>the Lex-2.</i>

554
00:30:28,129 --> 00:30:29,996
<i>It's</i>
<i>an aminoglycoside antibiotic.</i>

555
00:30:30,048 --> 00:30:33,183
It's what was keeping
the Lyme in check.

556
00:30:33,268 --> 00:30:36,303
We need to start her
on amoxicillin.

557
00:30:40,809 --> 00:30:43,310
Mm.

558
00:31:03,197 --> 00:31:04,865
You lied.

559
00:31:04,916 --> 00:31:07,584
Doesn't taste better
coming back up.

560
00:31:07,669 --> 00:31:10,170
Here's another one.
You look good.

561
00:31:10,221 --> 00:31:14,041
What's
the white blood cell count?

562
00:31:17,212 --> 00:31:21,014
It's down to 1,000,
still dropping.

563
00:31:27,155 --> 00:31:29,823
I need
more morphine.

564
00:31:29,891 --> 00:31:31,775
We're out.

565
00:31:31,860 --> 00:31:34,578
You've been using
my personal supply

566
00:31:34,662 --> 00:31:36,663
of painkillers
for the last eight hours.

567
00:31:36,731 --> 00:31:42,252
You have--
you have enough for both of us?

568
00:31:42,337 --> 00:31:47,424
I've got enough stashed
around here for a minyan.

569
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:50,511
Mm.

570
00:31:56,518 --> 00:31:58,552
Just remember
they're a gift.

571
00:31:58,603 --> 00:32:01,605
So it's rude
to keep throwing them up.

572
00:32:01,689 --> 00:32:04,090
Found that out with
those candlesticks you got me.

573
00:32:49,687 --> 00:32:52,806
We think it's Lyme.

574
00:32:52,857 --> 00:32:55,492
<i>I would have seen</i>
<i>signs of that.</i>

575
00:32:55,577 --> 00:32:57,161
Not if the Lex-2 was keeping it
in check.

576
00:32:57,228 --> 00:32:58,946
We live in the city.

577
00:32:58,997 --> 00:33:01,114
We don't have pets.

578
00:33:01,166 --> 00:33:02,783
She's never even been
in the woods.

579
00:33:02,851 --> 00:33:04,918
Yes, I have.

580
00:33:04,986 --> 00:33:06,420
With daddy.

581
00:33:10,658 --> 00:33:11,792
I should have told you,

582
00:33:11,860 --> 00:33:13,877
<i>but I know</i>
<i>how you feel about it.</i>

583
00:33:13,962 --> 00:33:15,379
I grew up hunting
with my dad.

584
00:33:15,463 --> 00:33:16,847
I wanted to share it
with my daughter

585
00:33:16,915 --> 00:33:17,931
<i>at least once.</i>

586
00:33:17,999 --> 00:33:19,499
We only took pictures.

587
00:33:19,567 --> 00:33:20,851
You don't need
to be mad.

588
00:33:20,935 --> 00:33:22,186
<i>Maybe we should step outside.</i>

589
00:33:22,270 --> 00:33:23,770
<i>No.</i>

590
00:33:26,507 --> 00:33:29,009
We can't protect her
from everything.

591
00:33:32,197 --> 00:33:35,732
I assume you'll need
a lumbar puncture to confirm.

592
00:33:58,650 --> 00:34:02,737
<i>You lost a contact?</i>

593
00:34:02,804 --> 00:34:06,157
Going to
the little boy's room.

594
00:34:06,241 --> 00:34:09,243
They're called adult diapers
for a reason.

595
00:34:09,310 --> 00:34:10,494
Use it.

596
00:34:10,579 --> 00:34:11,445
I did,
and if you think

597
00:34:11,496 --> 00:34:12,813
I'm gonna let you change me--

598
00:34:12,864 --> 00:34:14,165
It's okay.
I'm a doctor.

599
00:34:14,249 --> 00:34:15,282
Hey!

600
00:34:15,334 --> 00:34:17,585
<i>Just leave me alone.</i>

601
00:34:26,878 --> 00:34:28,763
It's pathetic.

602
00:34:28,830 --> 00:34:31,766
I'm pathetic.

603
00:34:31,833 --> 00:34:33,134
An oncologist
with cancer.

604
00:34:33,185 --> 00:34:35,803
Of all the things
that could be killing me...

605
00:34:35,854 --> 00:34:37,638
It's like the universe
is giving me

606
00:34:37,689 --> 00:34:39,390
the big middle finger.

607
00:34:45,147 --> 00:34:47,014
The universe doesn't care--

608
00:34:47,065 --> 00:34:48,616
<i>Why me?</i>

609
00:34:48,683 --> 00:34:51,535
I'm always telling my patients

610
00:34:51,620 --> 00:34:54,354
not to torture themselves,
because there's no answer.

611
00:34:54,406 --> 00:34:55,990
Sound advice.

612
00:34:56,041 --> 00:34:57,825
It's cruel advice.

613
00:34:57,893 --> 00:34:59,493
They were just trying
to make sense

614
00:34:59,544 --> 00:35:01,245
of what was happening
to them,

615
00:35:01,329 --> 00:35:05,032
and I'm there telling them
not to bother?

616
00:35:05,083 --> 00:35:08,769
I should have spent my life
being more like you.

617
00:35:08,837 --> 00:35:12,256
Should have been a manipulative,
self-centered,

618
00:35:12,340 --> 00:35:13,707
narcissistic ass

619
00:35:13,759 --> 00:35:15,876
who brought misery
to everything and everyone

620
00:35:15,927 --> 00:35:18,262
in his life.

621
00:35:22,684 --> 00:35:24,718
You'd still have cancer.

622
00:35:24,770 --> 00:35:26,187
Yeah!

623
00:35:26,238 --> 00:35:28,939
But at least I'd feel
like I deserved it.

624
00:35:34,663 --> 00:35:37,331
Do you think my parents
will get back together?

625
00:35:40,635 --> 00:35:43,587
I don't know.

626
00:35:43,672 --> 00:35:45,005
I'm sure
they love each other, but--

627
00:35:45,073 --> 00:35:47,407
They only fight
about me.

628
00:35:47,459 --> 00:35:51,562
That's because they care
so much.

629
00:35:51,630 --> 00:35:54,648
So maybe when I die,

630
00:35:54,716 --> 00:35:57,418
they'll get back together.

631
00:36:02,757 --> 00:36:04,859
Emily, what's wrong?

632
00:36:04,926 --> 00:36:06,977
I can't move my arm.

633
00:36:15,237 --> 00:36:17,788
Just keep your arms up for me.

634
00:36:17,873 --> 00:36:18,873
What's happening to her?

635
00:36:18,940 --> 00:36:20,774
She's having a stroke.

636
00:36:28,467 --> 00:36:29,950
Okay, your heart rate's up,
BP's tanking.

637
00:36:30,001 --> 00:36:31,135
White blood count's
at 500.

638
00:36:31,219 --> 00:36:33,120
We have to go
to the hospital now.

639
00:36:33,171 --> 00:36:34,955
No.
I don't have the equipment

640
00:36:35,006 --> 00:36:36,257
or the meds
to handle this.

641
00:36:36,308 --> 00:36:38,342
No.
Win or lose.

642
00:36:38,426 --> 00:36:40,460
Win or lose.
That was the deal.

643
00:36:40,512 --> 00:36:42,930
That was the deal
when there was an "or".

644
00:36:42,981 --> 00:36:44,965
You can't win this.

645
00:36:45,016 --> 00:36:46,734
No.

646
00:36:46,801 --> 00:36:51,739
No.
I'd rather die here.

647
00:36:51,806 --> 00:36:54,074
Not in an ambulance.

648
00:36:54,142 --> 00:36:57,194
Not in a hospital.

649
00:36:57,279 --> 00:36:58,696
Please,

650
00:36:58,780 --> 00:36:59,697
you can't do that
to me.

651
00:36:59,781 --> 00:37:02,666
I can't--

652
00:37:02,751 --> 00:37:05,953
House...

653
00:37:06,004 --> 00:37:09,123
Please.

654
00:37:09,174 --> 00:37:12,993
Promise me
that you won't do that to me.

655
00:37:13,044 --> 00:37:15,513
Promise me.

656
00:37:18,383 --> 00:37:21,519
Okay,
I promise.

657
00:37:30,137 --> 00:37:31,387
Stroke.

658
00:37:32,125 --> 00:37:33,458
Blockage
in her hepatic vein,

659
00:37:33,509 --> 00:37:34,826
coughing blood,

660
00:37:34,877 --> 00:37:35,844
trouble breathing,

661
00:37:35,928 --> 00:37:37,212
and Raynaud's.

662
00:37:37,296 --> 00:37:39,014
If we hadn't
already ruled it out,

663
00:37:39,098 --> 00:37:41,332
it sounds like textbook
pulmonary embolism.

664
00:37:41,384 --> 00:37:43,385
What mimics a clot
but isn't a clot?

665
00:37:43,469 --> 00:37:44,519
Fungal infection.

666
00:37:44,604 --> 00:37:45,854
Her CSF was clean.

667
00:37:45,938 --> 00:37:47,639
No bacterial
or fungal markers.

668
00:37:47,707 --> 00:37:49,057
<i>Anyone tried calling House?</i>

669
00:37:49,142 --> 00:37:50,308
<i>Not picking up.</i>

670
00:37:50,359 --> 00:37:51,059
<i>Or returning messages or texts.</i>

671
00:37:51,144 --> 00:37:52,611
We're on our own here,

672
00:37:52,678 --> 00:37:54,813
so just give me
some theories we can use.

673
00:37:54,864 --> 00:37:56,782
Hematologic malignancies.

674
00:37:56,849 --> 00:38:00,085
A-T patients are more prone
to that form of cancer.

675
00:38:00,153 --> 00:38:01,653
You think cancer would present

676
00:38:01,704 --> 00:38:03,822
<i>and kill her</i>
<i>in three days?</i>

677
00:38:03,873 --> 00:38:06,124
Not cancer.

678
00:38:06,192 --> 00:38:09,127
But a tumor could act
like a clot.

679
00:38:09,195 --> 00:38:10,212
An atrial myxoma.

680
00:38:12,715 --> 00:38:15,250
A primary heart tumor.

681
00:38:15,334 --> 00:38:16,868
The swinging motion
of the myxoma

682
00:38:16,919 --> 00:38:18,136
intermittently blocked
the flow of blood

683
00:38:18,204 --> 00:38:19,471
through the right atrium.

684
00:38:19,538 --> 00:38:21,873
Inflow blockage stagnated
the hepatic vein,

685
00:38:21,924 --> 00:38:23,875
which clotted
and caused liver failure.

686
00:38:23,926 --> 00:38:26,812
Outflow blockage caused the
Raynaud's phenomenon and stroke.

687
00:38:26,879 --> 00:38:28,480
Pieces of the tumor broke off

688
00:38:28,547 --> 00:38:30,381
and lodged
in the lungs,

689
00:38:30,433 --> 00:38:31,716
<i>causing Emily's</i>
<i>breathing problems</i>

690
00:38:31,767 --> 00:38:33,151
<i>and the coughing blood.</i>

691
00:38:33,219 --> 00:38:34,552
We'll remove the tumor
surgically,

692
00:38:34,604 --> 00:38:37,322
and hopefully the biopsy reveals
it's benign.

693
00:39:14,193 --> 00:39:17,262
Wow.
You--

694
00:39:17,330 --> 00:39:19,114
you really look
like crap.

695
00:39:19,198 --> 00:39:23,735
Been fighting a cold
lately.

696
00:39:23,786 --> 00:39:27,105
Seven to ten days
for the swelling to go down.

697
00:39:27,156 --> 00:39:29,658
Then we rescan
and schedule the surgery.

698
00:39:44,507 --> 00:39:48,293
I seem to recall

699
00:39:48,344 --> 00:39:49,561
I said some things
to you--

700
00:39:49,628 --> 00:39:50,628
<i>You talked a lot.</i>

701
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:52,013
I stopped listening

702
00:39:52,098 --> 00:39:55,467
after you confessed
your fear of dolphins.

703
00:39:59,238 --> 00:40:00,805
Can we just tone down
the bromance a few notches?

704
00:40:00,856 --> 00:40:02,807
My leg is killing me.

705
00:40:02,858 --> 00:40:05,193
One last favor.

706
00:40:05,278 --> 00:40:09,998
I'd like to actually make it
to the bathroom this time.

707
00:40:26,432 --> 00:40:28,850
I thought you said
you had plenty of Vicodin.

708
00:40:28,935 --> 00:40:31,436
Everybody lies.

709
00:40:31,503 --> 00:40:34,439
So the way I felt,
you feel that, what,

710
00:40:34,506 --> 00:40:37,175
most of the time?

711
00:40:37,226 --> 00:40:39,010
It really does suck
being you, doesn't it?

712
00:40:39,061 --> 00:40:41,880
At least
I don't have cancer.

713
00:40:54,877 --> 00:40:57,212
The tumor was benign.

714
00:40:57,296 --> 00:41:00,065
<i>And we were able</i>
<i>to remove all of it.</i>

715
00:41:00,116 --> 00:41:02,884
Does this mean
I'm not sick anymore?

716
00:41:05,705 --> 00:41:09,240
No, honey.

717
00:41:09,292 --> 00:41:10,875
<i>The tumor didn't cause</i>

718
00:41:10,943 --> 00:41:13,244
<i>your genetic condition.</i>

719
00:41:13,296 --> 00:41:16,181
You're still sick.

720
00:41:16,248 --> 00:41:18,616
<i>But we never let that</i>
<i>stop us before, right?</i>

721
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:24,089
So what do you want to do
when we get out of here?

722
00:41:24,140 --> 00:41:25,307
Have you been
to the aquarium?

723
00:41:25,391 --> 00:41:26,975
It's pretty cool.
Can we go, daddy?

724
00:41:27,059 --> 00:41:30,011
You bet.

725
00:41:30,096 --> 00:41:31,596
Me too?

726
00:41:31,647 --> 00:41:35,066
Can she come
with us?

727
00:41:35,134 --> 00:41:38,436
You know mommy never has
to ask.

728
00:41:47,980 --> 00:41:50,481
