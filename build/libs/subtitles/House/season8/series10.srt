1
00:00:06,350 --> 00:00:08,651
How long has your daughter
had trouble breathing?

2
00:00:08,736 --> 00:00:11,854
About a week now.

3
00:00:11,939 --> 00:00:14,023
The best dads
wait two or more.

4
00:00:14,108 --> 00:00:17,143
Yeah, no, it's not
like it's serious.

5
00:00:17,194 --> 00:00:18,911
I-I checked online,
and it's...

6
00:00:18,979 --> 00:00:20,079
Asthma or something.

7
00:00:20,147 --> 00:00:21,247
<i>"Or something"</i>

8
00:00:21,314 --> 00:00:22,698
is the number one killer
of teens

9
00:00:22,783 --> 00:00:24,333
with no medical degree.

10
00:00:24,418 --> 00:00:26,002
When was the last time
he took you to see a doctor?

11
00:00:26,086 --> 00:00:28,087
Uh, like five months ago.

12
00:00:28,155 --> 00:00:30,339
We went a clinic in Trenton.
I had strep throat.

13
00:00:30,424 --> 00:00:31,991
You remember the antibiotic
they gave you?

14
00:00:32,059 --> 00:00:33,209
Is it neomycin?

15
00:00:33,277 --> 00:00:34,510
<i>Amoxicillin.</i>

16
00:00:37,731 --> 00:00:41,551
So about the inhaler
for my asthma, I was--

17
00:00:41,635 --> 00:00:42,635
Sorry!

18
00:00:42,686 --> 00:00:44,069
<i>Hospital policy</i>

19
00:00:44,121 --> 00:00:46,071
specifically prohibits me
from giving meds

20
00:00:46,123 --> 00:00:47,423
to unrelated
homeless people

21
00:00:47,508 --> 00:00:50,209
pretending to be
father and daughter.

22
00:00:50,260 --> 00:00:52,211
Your pants
are a size too short,

23
00:00:52,262 --> 00:00:53,579
<i>so either you grew</i>
<i>a couple of inches</i>

24
00:00:53,630 --> 00:00:55,965
or you grabbed the closest size
in a thrift store.

25
00:00:56,049 --> 00:00:57,917
And only you have dimples,
which are adorable,

26
00:00:57,968 --> 00:01:02,021
but they're also an x-linked
dominant genetic trait.

27
00:01:02,088 --> 00:01:03,689
Which actually doesn't
prove anything.

28
00:01:03,757 --> 00:01:05,525
<i>The fact that she didn't</i>
<i>burst into tears tells me</i>

29
00:01:05,592 --> 00:01:07,426
that you never thought
he was your dad.

30
00:01:07,478 --> 00:01:09,261
Let's get out of here.

31
00:01:11,031 --> 00:01:13,032
<i>Since you're the brains</i>
<i>of the operation,</i>

32
00:01:13,099 --> 00:01:14,734
might wanna stick around.

33
00:01:14,785 --> 00:01:16,402
What, so I can get busted
by Social Services?

34
00:01:16,453 --> 00:01:18,905
No, so you can stop
bleeding out of your ear.

35
00:01:21,107 --> 00:01:23,659
It's usually a sign
of a skull fracture.

36
00:01:23,744 --> 00:01:27,246
<i>Someone been using your head</i>
<i>as a soccer ball?</i>

37
00:01:27,314 --> 00:01:27,859
No.

38
00:01:27,884 --> 00:01:29,555
Much as I'd like
to take your word for it,

39
00:01:29,750 --> 00:01:31,834
I have no interest in taking
your word for it.

40
00:01:31,919 --> 00:01:35,922
No tenderness, no pain.

41
00:01:35,973 --> 00:01:37,640
Looks like you might
actually be telling the truth

42
00:01:37,724 --> 00:01:38,891
about something.

43
00:01:43,147 --> 00:01:45,064
Ear canal is fine.

44
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:48,184
You don't have a fever.

45
00:01:49,686 --> 00:01:50,686
Pay the man.

46
00:01:50,771 --> 00:01:52,438
He's late
for a trashcan fire.

47
00:02:04,785 --> 00:02:06,035
Would you--would you
tell me what's going on?

48
00:02:06,119 --> 00:02:08,153
What's wrong with me?

49
00:02:08,205 --> 00:02:10,056
I have no idea.

00:02:19,008 --> 00:02:41,554
?

53
00:02:47,077 --> 00:02:48,544
<i>Why'd you ask to meet us</i>

54
00:02:48,629 --> 00:02:49,962
30 miles away
from the hospital?

55
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:56,385
Because I can.

56
00:02:56,470 --> 00:02:58,037
Also, Chris Christie's blog

57
00:02:58,088 --> 00:03:00,673
says the pancakes here
are the best.

58
00:03:00,724 --> 00:03:03,542
So...what do we got
on this 18-year-old

59
00:03:03,594 --> 00:03:05,210
with the ear bleed
and the breathing problems?

60
00:03:05,262 --> 00:03:07,230
CT confirms
no skull fracture,

61
00:03:07,314 --> 00:03:09,214
and looking at her
confirms she's not 18.

62
00:03:09,266 --> 00:03:11,400
Yes, she is.

63
00:03:11,485 --> 00:03:13,185
Says so in the file.

64
00:03:13,237 --> 00:03:14,503
We can't treat
an underage patient

65
00:03:14,571 --> 00:03:15,888
without a guardian--
we need to call Social Services.

66
00:03:15,939 --> 00:03:17,723
I cut a deal
with the patient.

67
00:03:17,774 --> 00:03:19,558
We don't call,
she doesn't bolt.

68
00:03:19,610 --> 00:03:21,160
<i>Whatever age,</i>
<i>living on the street</i>

69
00:03:21,227 --> 00:03:22,745
makes her vulnerable
to malnutrition,

70
00:03:22,829 --> 00:03:23,946
drug use, H.I.V.,

71
00:03:24,031 --> 00:03:25,781
all things which could
explain her symptoms.

72
00:03:25,849 --> 00:03:27,900
No sign of malnutrition.
Tox screen is clear.

73
00:03:27,951 --> 00:03:29,669
S.T.D. panel
was negative.

74
00:03:29,736 --> 00:03:31,754
And...is that Foreman?

75
00:03:35,008 --> 00:03:36,626
Oh, my goodness,
it is!

76
00:03:36,710 --> 00:03:38,410
Hi, Dean Foreman!

77
00:03:50,474 --> 00:03:52,108
Are you not gonna
introduce us

78
00:03:52,192 --> 00:03:53,826
because we're married?

79
00:03:53,894 --> 00:03:55,628
Oh, no, wait--
that's her.

80
00:03:55,696 --> 00:03:58,814
She's a pharmaceutical rep,
and this is a working breakfast.

81
00:03:58,899 --> 00:04:00,366
<i>In a restaurant</i>
<i>that's nowhere near your home</i>

82
00:04:00,433 --> 00:04:01,934
or the hospital.

83
00:04:02,002 --> 00:04:04,770
Chris Christie
recommends the pancakes.

84
00:04:07,741 --> 00:04:09,792
<i>Squamous cell</i>
<i>middle ear tumor could have</i>

85
00:04:09,876 --> 00:04:11,160
caused the ear bleed.

86
00:04:11,244 --> 00:04:12,912
Paraneoplastic reaction
caused the breathing problems.

87
00:04:12,963 --> 00:04:14,297
Middle ear looks
completely normal.

88
00:04:14,381 --> 00:04:15,398
But there is thickening
in the lining of the wall

89
00:04:15,465 --> 00:04:16,916
of the third ventricle.

90
00:04:16,967 --> 00:04:18,834
<i>Could be a sign</i>
<i>of cerebral infection.</i>

91
00:04:18,919 --> 00:04:20,086
<i>Would explain</i>
<i>the lack of fever.</i>

92
00:04:20,137 --> 00:04:21,504
Pneumococcus
is pretty common

93
00:04:21,588 --> 00:04:22,838
<i>among the homeless</i>
<i>population.</i>

94
00:04:22,923 --> 00:04:24,690
We should find out
if she's been vaccinated.

95
00:04:24,758 --> 00:04:26,208
Sure, ask her,
and when she refuses

96
00:04:26,276 --> 00:04:27,510
to tell you anything,

97
00:04:27,594 --> 00:04:31,230
start her on Ceftriaxone
for pneumococcus.

98
00:04:31,297 --> 00:04:33,099
And if she says
she has been vaccinated?

99
00:04:33,150 --> 00:04:34,483
Then don't believe her,

100
00:04:34,568 --> 00:04:36,185
and start her on Ceftriaxone
for pneumococcus.

101
00:04:36,269 --> 00:04:38,154
How about we don't believe
she's gonna bolt

102
00:04:38,238 --> 00:04:39,855
and we call
Social Services?

103
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:41,273
While I'm in
the little boys' room,

104
00:04:41,325 --> 00:04:42,908
you can pretend that I'm
seriously considering that idea.

105
00:04:45,078 --> 00:04:46,362
The bathroom's that way.

106
00:04:47,864 --> 00:04:49,448
Pretty sure there's
one in the hospital.

107
00:04:55,872 --> 00:04:58,624
When I was your age,
I ran away.

108
00:04:58,675 --> 00:05:01,927
Lived on my own.

109
00:05:01,995 --> 00:05:03,763
- At the time, it seemed--
- Oh, let me guess.

110
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:06,032
Life with mom and dad
was kind of a drag.

111
00:05:06,099 --> 00:05:08,718
So you just ran away,

112
00:05:08,802 --> 00:05:10,353
lived with friends,
and partied with guys

113
00:05:10,437 --> 00:05:12,855
that you knew
your parents would hate.

114
00:05:12,939 --> 00:05:14,540
And then when you got tired
of being a rebel,

115
00:05:14,608 --> 00:05:16,842
you just went home.

116
00:05:16,893 --> 00:05:20,546
Being homeless
isn't a vacation for me.

117
00:05:20,614 --> 00:05:23,015
And I'm not acting out.

118
00:05:23,083 --> 00:05:24,950
My life at home sucked,

119
00:05:25,018 --> 00:05:26,652
so I got the hell
out of there.

120
00:05:26,703 --> 00:05:27,787
There are other options

121
00:05:27,854 --> 00:05:29,521
besides living
on the streets.

122
00:05:29,573 --> 00:05:31,907
Right, like group homes,
where you're packed in

123
00:05:31,992 --> 00:05:35,244
with as many messed-up
delinquent kids as possible,

124
00:05:35,328 --> 00:05:36,412
foster parents
who only take you in

125
00:05:36,496 --> 00:05:37,880
because
you're a meal ticket.

126
00:05:37,964 --> 00:05:40,332
I can think of easier ways
to make 175 bucks a week.

127
00:05:40,384 --> 00:05:41,634
No, you're right--
I really should roll the dice

128
00:05:41,701 --> 00:05:43,886
and hope for a pair
that don't ruin my life

129
00:05:43,970 --> 00:05:46,922
the way that my mom--
get your hands off my stuff!

130
00:05:47,007 --> 00:05:48,891
The stuff might tell us
more about why you're sick.

131
00:05:48,975 --> 00:05:50,509
A history textbook.
You go to school?

132
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:52,395
I don't plan on
being homeless forever.

133
00:05:58,151 --> 00:05:59,752
Hello, good sir.

134
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:01,604
My brother,
the General here,

135
00:06:01,688 --> 00:06:03,388
gots the green-apple
quickstep.

136
00:06:09,446 --> 00:06:11,864
One of us is in
the wrong time zone.

137
00:06:11,932 --> 00:06:13,249
<i>And if it's me,</i>
<i>I need to talk</i>

138
00:06:13,333 --> 00:06:16,535
to a stockbroker and anyone
from the Kennedy family,

139
00:06:16,603 --> 00:06:17,503
in that order.

140
00:06:17,571 --> 00:06:18,621
Well, he got the runs,

141
00:06:18,705 --> 00:06:19,789
and we do need him

142
00:06:19,873 --> 00:06:21,340
up and at 'em
for battle tomorrow.

143
00:06:21,407 --> 00:06:22,575
<i>It's hardly</i>
<i>authentic,</i>

144
00:06:22,642 --> 00:06:24,343
coming to a newfangled
clinic,

145
00:06:24,411 --> 00:06:26,128
especially with
a Yankee doctor.

146
00:06:28,131 --> 00:06:31,250
Sir, are you
questioning my resolve?

147
00:06:31,301 --> 00:06:33,552
Yes, and your sanity.

148
00:06:33,603 --> 00:06:35,304
<i>I'm multitasking.</i>

149
00:06:35,388 --> 00:06:36,605
Uh, General...

150
00:06:36,690 --> 00:06:38,307
You're not allowed out.

151
00:06:38,391 --> 00:06:40,860
We swore that we would
see the elephant together.

152
00:06:44,981 --> 00:06:47,867
Well, far be it from me
to come between two nut jobs

153
00:06:47,934 --> 00:06:49,819
and their "elephant."

154
00:06:55,826 --> 00:06:57,576
I could add some Mercury,
if you want to make it

155
00:06:57,627 --> 00:06:59,145
more authentic.

156
00:06:59,212 --> 00:07:01,997
The Confederacy
thanks you, Doc.

157
00:07:13,393 --> 00:07:15,427
Got House's phone.

158
00:07:15,479 --> 00:07:18,347
Deleted all photos
of you and Anita.

159
00:07:18,431 --> 00:07:20,799
- I owe you.
- An affair?

160
00:07:20,851 --> 00:07:22,535
Never knew
you were such a tramp.

161
00:07:22,602 --> 00:07:23,569
Neither did I.

162
00:07:23,636 --> 00:07:27,022
Anita, she's fun, smart.

163
00:07:27,107 --> 00:07:28,474
Not looking
for anything serious.

164
00:07:28,542 --> 00:07:30,576
It's--it's...
Pretty perfect.

165
00:07:30,644 --> 00:07:33,579
Except for the annoying
guilt about the husband.

166
00:07:33,647 --> 00:07:35,314
The lies she must
be telling him.

167
00:07:35,365 --> 00:07:37,166
<i>But not guilty enough</i>

168
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:38,367
to stop seeing her.

169
00:07:38,451 --> 00:07:39,869
<i>She's smoking hot,</i>

170
00:07:39,953 --> 00:07:41,320
and it's not his job
to protect her marriage.

171
00:07:41,388 --> 00:07:43,789
Aren't you supposed
to be pointing a finger

172
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:45,925
at your own life
as a cautionary tale?

173
00:07:45,992 --> 00:07:48,227
If not for cheating,
I might still have a wife,

174
00:07:48,295 --> 00:07:50,546
but I wouldn't have
Sophie and Sophia.

175
00:07:50,630 --> 00:07:52,064
Which means

176
00:07:52,132 --> 00:07:55,334
I wouldn't be preparing
for their visit this week

177
00:07:55,402 --> 00:07:57,720
by child locking
all my cabinets,

178
00:07:57,804 --> 00:07:59,271
padding table corners,

179
00:07:59,339 --> 00:08:02,558
and getting rid of every
single magazine.

180
00:08:02,642 --> 00:08:04,393
You could probably
just hide the porn

181
00:08:04,477 --> 00:08:06,511
in your underwear drawer.

182
00:08:06,563 --> 00:08:10,950
Magazines go away so I won't
ignore my children.

183
00:08:11,017 --> 00:08:12,902
I know I have
to pay attention to them.

184
00:08:12,986 --> 00:08:14,019
I want to pay attention
to them,

185
00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:17,406
but they're just so...

186
00:08:17,490 --> 00:08:19,291
Boring.

187
00:08:25,248 --> 00:08:28,751
Did you learn anything
at Jane Doe's school?

188
00:08:28,835 --> 00:08:29,969
<i>They did a bunch</i>
<i>of vaccinations,</i>

189
00:08:30,036 --> 00:08:31,220
<i>including pneumococcus.</i>

190
00:08:31,304 --> 00:08:32,738
<i>Take her off</i>
<i>the Ceftriaxone.</i>

191
00:08:32,806 --> 00:08:34,390
So we're back
to square none?

192
00:08:34,474 --> 00:08:35,808
<i>Not exactly.</i>

193
00:08:35,875 --> 00:08:37,709
The name she registered under
seems to be fake,

194
00:08:37,761 --> 00:08:39,728
but the address
is a foreclosed house.

195
00:08:39,813 --> 00:08:41,146
<i>We'll let you know</i>
<i>what we find.</i>

196
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:45,818
Plenty of food, water.

197
00:08:45,885 --> 00:08:47,052
And beer.

198
00:08:47,103 --> 00:08:48,320
<i>She eats well.</i>

199
00:08:48,388 --> 00:08:49,822
Goes to school
and makes good grades.

200
00:08:49,889 --> 00:08:51,073
<i>She's a homeless girl</i>

201
00:08:51,157 --> 00:08:52,724
who's captain
of the volleyball team.

202
00:08:52,776 --> 00:08:53,943
<i>How can you</i>
<i>be okay with this?</i>

203
00:08:54,027 --> 00:08:56,412
Your mom sends you to work
with snacks.

204
00:08:56,496 --> 00:08:58,530
I want and need parents.

205
00:08:58,582 --> 00:09:00,799
<i>Jane Doe is flourishing</i>
<i>without them.</i>

206
00:09:00,867 --> 00:09:01,700
<i>Maybe.</i>

207
00:09:04,004 --> 00:09:05,904
But this mold
definitely is.

208
00:09:07,707 --> 00:09:09,375
You went to my school.

209
00:09:09,442 --> 00:09:10,926
Now that they know,
they'll report me.

210
00:09:11,011 --> 00:09:13,012
I can't go back there!

211
00:09:13,079 --> 00:09:14,746
You may have
a fungal infection.

212
00:09:14,798 --> 00:09:15,914
You need that medicine.

213
00:09:15,966 --> 00:09:17,683
Fluconazole, right?

214
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:18,684
I'll get it at a clinic.

215
00:09:20,971 --> 00:09:22,137
Ohh! Oh.

216
00:09:22,222 --> 00:09:24,390
I can't feel my legs.

217
00:09:24,441 --> 00:09:25,975
Hey, wha--
is that the infection?

218
00:09:26,059 --> 00:09:27,943
I don't think so.

219
00:09:30,254 --> 00:09:33,634
So...What causes
an ear bleed,

220
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:35,340
breathing problems,

221
00:09:35,425 --> 00:09:38,727
and our runaway's
inability to run away?

222
00:09:38,794 --> 00:09:41,796
Fungal infection's
off the table.

223
00:09:41,848 --> 00:09:43,015
<i>What about</i>
<i>transverse myelitis?</i>

224
00:09:43,099 --> 00:09:44,766
Not with normal
posterior column function.

225
00:09:44,818 --> 00:09:47,135
I've been waiting
to do this for months.

226
00:09:47,187 --> 00:09:48,136
Pull!

227
00:09:53,776 --> 00:09:56,612
Sights seem to be
off on this.

228
00:09:56,663 --> 00:09:59,147
We didn't call
Social Services before

229
00:09:59,199 --> 00:10:00,616
<i>because we didn't want</i>
<i>the patient to take off.</i>

230
00:10:00,667 --> 00:10:03,051
Now she can't--there's
no reason for us not to call.

231
00:10:03,119 --> 00:10:05,454
Well, how about the reason
that there's no reason?

232
00:10:05,505 --> 00:10:07,506
This is working fine
for me.

233
00:10:07,590 --> 00:10:09,558
Pull!

234
00:10:12,462 --> 00:10:14,496
Well, now, that one
clearly took evasive action.

235
00:10:14,547 --> 00:10:15,631
<i>You want to protect her</i>

236
00:10:15,682 --> 00:10:16,665
because you think
she's fine on her own,

237
00:10:16,716 --> 00:10:17,933
outside the system.

238
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,301
Does anyone have a position

239
00:10:19,352 --> 00:10:21,136
on our patient's
<i>medical</i> condition?

240
00:10:21,204 --> 00:10:23,438
Could be endocarditis
with septic emboli.

241
00:10:23,506 --> 00:10:24,439
Pull!

242
00:10:28,278 --> 00:10:30,779
I'd turn around and shoot you,
but apparently I'd miss.

243
00:10:30,846 --> 00:10:32,731
There's no murmurs,
no Osler nodes.

244
00:10:32,815 --> 00:10:35,517
You've never done this
before, have you?

245
00:10:35,568 --> 00:10:36,985
No, I have not.

246
00:10:37,036 --> 00:10:38,687
But all the time
I had my ankle monitor on,

247
00:10:38,738 --> 00:10:41,156
I was furious
that I couldn't.

248
00:10:41,207 --> 00:10:42,741
Vasculitis fits.

249
00:10:44,911 --> 00:10:46,295
Start treatment
with steroids.

250
00:10:46,362 --> 00:10:49,381
She's lucky, she'll
be free to flee again.

251
00:10:49,465 --> 00:10:51,049
<i>Not once I call</i>
<i>Social Services.</i>

252
00:10:51,134 --> 00:10:53,552
I'm not giving up.

253
00:10:54,754 --> 00:10:56,421
You wanna bet?

254
00:10:56,506 --> 00:10:58,640
One shot, one birdie.

255
00:10:58,708 --> 00:10:59,725
You hit,
you make the call.

256
00:10:59,809 --> 00:11:01,760
You miss,
never mention it again.

257
00:11:01,844 --> 00:11:02,895
No.

258
00:11:02,979 --> 00:11:04,096
Why would I agree?

259
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:05,931
'Cause your
only other option is

260
00:11:06,015 --> 00:11:08,049
you call and I fire you.

261
00:11:25,285 --> 00:11:27,286
Pull!

262
00:11:41,884 --> 00:11:43,435
<i>She responding</i>
<i>to corticosteroids?</i>

263
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:44,519
Looks like it.

264
00:11:44,587 --> 00:11:45,920
And Social Services.

265
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,257
I thought for sure
there'd be some yelling

266
00:11:49,309 --> 00:11:51,693
or profanity,
possible bloodletting.

267
00:11:51,761 --> 00:11:53,928
<i>She's tired of living</i>
<i>on the streets after all.</i>

268
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:56,431
<i>I'll bet House re...gret...</i>

269
00:12:00,119 --> 00:12:02,955
Could he know
I'm good with a gun?

270
00:12:03,039 --> 00:12:05,907
I don't know how, but...

271
00:12:07,877 --> 00:12:09,211
Hiring a hooker

272
00:12:09,278 --> 00:12:10,545
to pretend to be
a social worker?

273
00:12:10,613 --> 00:12:13,382
She took a bet
that she knew she'd win.

274
00:12:13,449 --> 00:12:15,417
Frankly,
I feel violated.

275
00:12:15,468 --> 00:12:17,586
What happened to
the social worker I called?

276
00:12:17,637 --> 00:12:19,471
Apparently, someone
identifying themselves

277
00:12:19,539 --> 00:12:21,956
as Dr. Pujols called
and said the patient ran off.

278
00:12:24,093 --> 00:12:25,477
<i>Come on.</i>

279
00:12:25,561 --> 00:12:27,596
"Poo holes."

280
00:12:27,647 --> 00:12:29,531
<i>I've informed</i>
<i>Social Services</i>

281
00:12:29,599 --> 00:12:32,000
of the mistake and given Jane
Doe's description to the cops.

282
00:12:32,068 --> 00:12:32,967
They'll track down
the parents.

283
00:12:33,019 --> 00:12:34,186
Thank you.

284
00:12:34,270 --> 00:12:38,156
I'll leave you
and Dr. "Pujols" alone.

285
00:12:38,241 --> 00:12:39,474
You should have told me

286
00:12:39,525 --> 00:12:40,609
you were treating an underage
clinic patient.

287
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:42,977
I was giving you
the gift of deniability.

288
00:12:43,029 --> 00:12:44,979
Now I'm giving you the gift
of additional clinic hours.

289
00:12:45,031 --> 00:12:46,782
No, you're not.

290
00:12:46,833 --> 00:12:48,700
You've got
nothing on me.

291
00:12:48,785 --> 00:12:49,651
Check your phone.

292
00:12:53,289 --> 00:12:55,156
Uh...my phone?

293
00:12:55,208 --> 00:12:56,658
Oh, right. Yes, I--

294
00:12:56,709 --> 00:12:59,795
I did have
some pictures on that.

295
00:12:59,846 --> 00:13:01,630
But...

296
00:13:01,681 --> 00:13:04,716
I also have these.

297
00:13:04,801 --> 00:13:07,936
There's the two of you
kissing over dinner.

298
00:13:08,003 --> 00:13:10,105
Busting a move
in a night club.

299
00:13:10,172 --> 00:13:12,541
Is that your hand
near her nether regions?

300
00:13:14,410 --> 00:13:17,079
<i>Thanks again for taking off</i>
<i>the ankle bracelet.</i>

301
00:13:17,146 --> 00:13:19,080
I'm not gonna let you
blackmail me, House.

302
00:13:19,132 --> 00:13:20,849
Oh, of course not.

303
00:13:20,917 --> 00:13:22,300
<i>There's no way</i>
<i>someone of your integrity</i>

304
00:13:22,385 --> 00:13:24,419
would let me compromise
your job in any major way

305
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:26,988
over some tawdry
bit of gossip.

306
00:13:27,056 --> 00:13:29,257
<i>But what about</i>
<i>compromising it</i>

307
00:13:29,308 --> 00:13:30,942
in a minor way?

308
00:13:31,027 --> 00:13:32,927
Reduced clinic hours.

309
00:13:32,979 --> 00:13:34,663
Unlimited Internet
porn budget.

310
00:13:34,731 --> 00:13:35,947
<i>That makes much more sense</i>

311
00:13:36,032 --> 00:13:40,602
than the nuclear option
of ruining both our lives.

312
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:42,537
You can keep these.

313
00:13:42,605 --> 00:13:44,156
I got copies.

314
00:13:53,132 --> 00:13:55,133
How I miss
the sweet smell

315
00:13:55,218 --> 00:13:57,302
of stickin' it
to the man.

316
00:13:57,387 --> 00:13:58,670
Adams is right.

317
00:13:58,755 --> 00:13:59,888
You're protecting
this girl.

318
00:14:01,457 --> 00:14:02,841
No, I was wrong.

319
00:14:02,925 --> 00:14:05,060
It's the stench
of moralizing.

320
00:14:05,127 --> 00:14:07,262
I'm protecting myself
from meddling bureaucrats

321
00:14:07,313 --> 00:14:08,263
and parents.

322
00:14:08,314 --> 00:14:09,481
You admire this girl.

323
00:14:09,565 --> 00:14:11,400
She had a horrible
home life,

324
00:14:11,467 --> 00:14:13,018
so she went out
on her own.

325
00:14:13,102 --> 00:14:14,736
She's your road
not taken.

326
00:14:14,804 --> 00:14:15,804
I've always dreamed
of living

327
00:14:15,855 --> 00:14:17,406
in an abandoned
house with mold.

328
00:14:17,473 --> 00:14:18,907
House, all I'm
accusing you of

329
00:14:18,974 --> 00:14:20,308
is having a connection
with a patient.

330
00:14:20,359 --> 00:14:21,860
This is a good thing.

331
00:14:21,944 --> 00:14:24,029
It's not a good thing,
'cause it's not a thing.

332
00:14:24,113 --> 00:14:25,530
It is a thing...
which she'll prove

333
00:14:25,615 --> 00:14:27,365
when her parents show up

334
00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:29,618
and you start
protecting her from them.

335
00:14:35,258 --> 00:14:38,093
The sound I make is,

336
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:40,829
moooo!

337
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:43,882
The sound I make is,

338
00:14:43,966 --> 00:14:45,300
quack quack
quack quack quack.

339
00:15:09,992 --> 00:15:11,526
Moo.

340
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:19,584
The sound is quack.

341
00:15:19,669 --> 00:15:20,919
Quack quack.

342
00:15:22,889 --> 00:15:24,322
<i>Quack quack quack.</i>

343
00:15:28,110 --> 00:15:29,744
I'm an ass.

344
00:15:29,812 --> 00:15:32,197
On the plus side,
I can now program my DVR

345
00:15:32,281 --> 00:15:34,032
from my phone.

346
00:15:34,116 --> 00:15:35,534
They are kind of boring.

347
00:15:35,618 --> 00:15:37,819
All kids, not just yours.

348
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:39,204
Very helpful.

349
00:15:39,288 --> 00:15:40,622
You need to log more hours.

350
00:15:40,673 --> 00:15:43,458
Eventually, you'll pass boredom
and get to bonding.

351
00:15:43,509 --> 00:15:45,927
Kind of like
Stockholm syndrome.

352
00:15:45,995 --> 00:15:47,596
I heard the nurses talking.

353
00:15:47,663 --> 00:15:48,997
<i>You called Social Services</i>
<i>for real.</i>

354
00:15:49,048 --> 00:15:51,383
Because you shouldn't
be living on your own.

355
00:15:51,467 --> 00:15:53,268
Right, better my mom should
use me as a punching bag.

356
00:15:53,335 --> 00:15:55,937
If your mom abused you,

357
00:15:56,005 --> 00:15:58,006
Social Services won't
let you go home with her.

358
00:15:58,057 --> 00:16:00,892
Have I mentioned
I don't trust the system?

359
00:16:00,977 --> 00:16:02,561
We don't know
if you're better yet.

360
00:16:02,645 --> 00:16:04,178
You can't just take off.

361
00:16:05,448 --> 00:16:07,032
Uh, can we help you?

362
00:16:07,116 --> 00:16:09,183
<i>I'm Adele Brown from</i>
<i>Social Services, and this is--</i>

363
00:16:09,235 --> 00:16:10,819
I'm Ellen Rogers.

364
00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:12,621
Callie's mother.

365
00:16:12,688 --> 00:16:14,039
You haven't been that
for two years.

366
00:16:14,123 --> 00:16:15,624
I promise...

367
00:16:15,691 --> 00:16:16,625
Things are different.

368
00:16:16,692 --> 00:16:18,376
Mom...two sentences in,

369
00:16:18,461 --> 00:16:20,161
and you're already
making promises.

370
00:16:20,213 --> 00:16:21,580
Okay, maybe we need
to take a minute here

371
00:16:21,664 --> 00:16:23,048
and give Callie
some space.

372
00:16:23,132 --> 00:16:24,916
No, I don't need a minute.
I need her out of my life.

373
00:16:25,001 --> 00:16:26,668
Is she okay?

374
00:16:26,719 --> 00:16:27,802
I will be once you just...

375
00:16:29,755 --> 00:16:30,672
Oh, my God!

376
00:16:31,924 --> 00:16:33,225
<i>We need help in here!</i>

377
00:16:40,929 --> 00:16:42,890
- Go!
<i>- And they're off!</i>

378
00:16:42,990 --> 00:16:44,690
You bet 100 bucks
on a turtle race?

379
00:16:44,775 --> 00:16:47,309
I paid Mr. Chips 5 bucks
to take a dive.

380
00:16:49,613 --> 00:16:51,480
The bleeding
stopped on its own.

381
00:16:51,531 --> 00:16:52,832
<i>She got worse after</i>
<i>being on steroids,</i>

382
00:16:52,916 --> 00:16:54,867
so autoimmune is out.

383
00:16:54,951 --> 00:16:55,868
Diagnosis depends
on whether the blood

384
00:16:55,952 --> 00:16:57,036
was coming
from the sinuses,

385
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:58,454
lungs, or her guts.

386
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:01,841
Mr. Chips
looks like he wants it.

387
00:17:01,925 --> 00:17:05,160
100 bucks says he'll
make soup out of Franklin.

388
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:07,763
You're on.

389
00:17:09,016 --> 00:17:10,516
How'd the mom
seem to you?

390
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:11,967
If you're asking him
if she looks like someone

391
00:17:12,019 --> 00:17:13,168
who beat her kid,
you're a moron.

392
00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:15,054
Move your ass, Mr. Chips!

393
00:17:34,658 --> 00:17:36,642
You should have seen her face
when mom walked in.

394
00:17:36,649 --> 00:17:38,617
Callie hates her.
I don't think she's lying.

395
00:17:38,684 --> 00:17:41,036
Because people never lie
about people they hate.

396
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:42,788
<i>Big sinus bleed</i>
<i>could be sinusitis</i>

397
00:17:42,855 --> 00:17:43,872
<i>and a bleeding disorder.</i>

398
00:17:43,956 --> 00:17:45,323
She didn't complain
about a headache.

399
00:17:45,375 --> 00:17:46,491
The bleeding
is in her gut.

400
00:17:46,542 --> 00:17:47,692
<i>Could be</i>
<i>Zollinger-Ellison.</i>

401
00:17:47,744 --> 00:17:50,328
<i>Acid reflux causes asthma,</i>

402
00:17:50,380 --> 00:17:52,414
and the acid erodes the stomach,
causing the bleeding.

403
00:17:53,666 --> 00:17:56,201
Yes!

404
00:17:56,252 --> 00:17:57,552
Franklin rules.

405
00:17:57,637 --> 00:18:00,889
Mr. Chips drools.

406
00:18:00,973 --> 00:18:03,225
<i>Mr. Chips's owner only feeds</i>
<i>him on apples and bananas.</i>

407
00:18:03,309 --> 00:18:04,709
Nowhere near enough
vitamin A.

408
00:18:04,761 --> 00:18:05,727
Pay up.

409
00:18:05,812 --> 00:18:07,212
And do an upper endoscopy

410
00:18:07,263 --> 00:18:09,231
to confirm
for Zollinger-Ellison,

411
00:18:09,315 --> 00:18:11,349
after mommie dearest
has given her permission.

412
00:18:11,401 --> 00:18:13,735
Ellen shouldn't have consent
if she beat her daughter.

413
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:15,553
Doesn't matter if
she beat her daughter.

414
00:18:15,605 --> 00:18:20,025
Only matters if Social Services
says she beat her daughter.

415
00:18:20,076 --> 00:18:23,128
Good thing you made it
all official.

416
00:18:24,997 --> 00:18:27,532
Will the endoscopy
be painful?

417
00:18:27,583 --> 00:18:28,867
Is that an issue?

418
00:18:30,787 --> 00:18:32,387
It's a medical procedure.

419
00:18:32,455 --> 00:18:34,456
There will be
some discomfort.

420
00:18:34,524 --> 00:18:36,158
I never meant
to hurt my daughter.

421
00:18:37,543 --> 00:18:39,928
And yet you hit her.

422
00:18:40,012 --> 00:18:41,279
She told you that?

423
00:18:41,347 --> 00:18:43,548
And now you're gonna
tell me you didn't.

424
00:18:45,768 --> 00:18:47,636
I'm a drug addict.

425
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:49,438
And I've been
a lousy mom.

426
00:18:52,275 --> 00:18:54,192
Especially since
my husband died.

427
00:18:54,260 --> 00:18:57,095
I mean, he was closer
to Callie than I was,

428
00:18:57,146 --> 00:18:58,730
and I missed him...

429
00:18:58,781 --> 00:18:59,981
So much.

430
00:19:00,066 --> 00:19:02,701
And it was too hard.

431
00:19:02,768 --> 00:19:04,936
And taking Oxy just...

432
00:19:05,004 --> 00:19:07,739
made things easier.

433
00:19:07,790 --> 00:19:10,742
Right up until it made me
lose my daughter.

434
00:19:12,378 --> 00:19:15,714
I hurt Callie a lot.

435
00:19:15,781 --> 00:19:19,084
But one of the only things
that I can feel okay about

436
00:19:19,135 --> 00:19:21,620
is that I never hit her.

437
00:19:31,430 --> 00:19:34,366
Didn't peg you as
the midday fun kind of guy.

438
00:19:34,433 --> 00:19:36,501
So glad I was wrong.

439
00:19:38,938 --> 00:19:41,239
Ohh. Unfortunately,

440
00:19:41,307 --> 00:19:43,675
that's not why we're here.

441
00:19:45,311 --> 00:19:49,114
Remember that guy from
the restaurant yesterday?

442
00:19:49,165 --> 00:19:51,983
Mm-hmm.

443
00:19:52,034 --> 00:19:53,651
He's got pictures
of us.

444
00:19:53,703 --> 00:19:55,486
He's threatening
to show your husband.

445
00:19:55,538 --> 00:19:58,256
I thought you said that guy
was one of your best doctors.

446
00:19:58,324 --> 00:20:00,192
Yeah, not one
of my best people.

447
00:20:02,345 --> 00:20:05,213
We've gotta stop
seeing each other.

448
00:20:05,298 --> 00:20:07,182
Not necessarily.

449
00:20:07,266 --> 00:20:09,367
I told my husband
about you.

450
00:20:11,103 --> 00:20:12,053
What?

451
00:20:12,138 --> 00:20:13,939
Why?

452
00:20:14,006 --> 00:20:16,507
He was saying that things
had been better lately

453
00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:19,177
between him and I,
that I was happier.

454
00:20:19,228 --> 00:20:21,363
I said that I was.

455
00:20:21,447 --> 00:20:24,015
And that you
were the reason.

456
00:20:24,066 --> 00:20:26,785
And...He was okay
with that?

457
00:20:26,852 --> 00:20:28,019
Not initially.

458
00:20:28,070 --> 00:20:29,955
It was a pretty tough
conversation.

459
00:20:30,022 --> 00:20:32,690
Neither of us is ready
to give up on the marriage.

460
00:20:32,742 --> 00:20:35,493
And I am not ready
to give up this.

461
00:20:39,215 --> 00:20:41,466
You don't have to feel
so guilty anymore.

462
00:20:55,431 --> 00:20:57,482
You didn't need
to shoot yourself.

463
00:20:57,549 --> 00:20:59,550
I could have given you
a Section 8.

464
00:21:01,387 --> 00:21:02,737
We've hit the drills
pretty hard,

465
00:21:02,822 --> 00:21:04,222
and by the fourth round,
my hand went numb.

466
00:21:04,273 --> 00:21:05,774
The gun slipped and--

467
00:21:05,858 --> 00:21:07,392
I only had blanks in it,
but...

468
00:21:07,443 --> 00:21:09,394
It's funny how nearly
shooting your toe off

469
00:21:09,445 --> 00:21:11,229
cured that
speech impediment.

470
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:13,114
Ah. Yeah.
Sorry about that.

471
00:21:13,199 --> 00:21:15,784
Sheldon's a...Progressive.

472
00:21:15,868 --> 00:21:17,669
Eh--compared to who?

473
00:21:17,736 --> 00:21:19,087
Rupert Murdoch?

474
00:21:19,171 --> 00:21:20,538
Progressives are reenactors

475
00:21:20,590 --> 00:21:22,123
who strive for
complete authenticity.

476
00:21:22,208 --> 00:21:24,709
They never drop character
while in uniform.

477
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:27,178
Whereas you just
dabble in crazy.

478
00:21:29,715 --> 00:21:30,715
<i>Sheldon and I had</i>
<i>a big falling out</i>

479
00:21:30,766 --> 00:21:32,050
<i>years ago.</i>

480
00:21:32,101 --> 00:21:33,351
<i>We only really started</i>

481
00:21:33,419 --> 00:21:35,604
talking again because
of the reenactments.

482
00:21:35,688 --> 00:21:37,155
They, uh...

483
00:21:37,223 --> 00:21:39,140
Gave me my brother back.

484
00:21:39,225 --> 00:21:41,259
<i>That's a very moving story.</i>

485
00:21:41,310 --> 00:21:42,694
Be a lot more affecting
if you hadn't

486
00:21:42,761 --> 00:21:46,114
bonded over something
so completely idiotic.

487
00:21:51,153 --> 00:21:53,121
Your mom didn't
hit you, did she?

488
00:21:55,474 --> 00:21:57,108
No.

489
00:21:57,159 --> 00:21:58,609
Then why'd
you lie about it?

490
00:22:01,497 --> 00:22:03,715
Because I wanted
to get out of here.

491
00:22:03,782 --> 00:22:05,166
People understand
getting hit

492
00:22:05,251 --> 00:22:07,752
more than
what my mom does.

493
00:22:07,820 --> 00:22:10,905
Tell me.
Maybe I'll understand.

494
00:22:13,625 --> 00:22:16,895
Well, I was the mom.

495
00:22:16,962 --> 00:22:19,731
She couldn't keep a job.

496
00:22:19,799 --> 00:22:21,266
She'd spend
all her money on pills.

497
00:22:21,334 --> 00:22:22,901
I had to get a job.

498
00:22:22,968 --> 00:22:25,487
Double shifts,
just to keep the power on.

499
00:22:25,571 --> 00:22:27,972
Keep food in the house.

500
00:22:28,024 --> 00:22:30,675
I couldn't tell you how many
times she nearly O.D.ed

501
00:22:30,743 --> 00:22:33,645
<i>and I had to clean her up</i>
<i>and put her in bed.</i>

502
00:22:36,015 --> 00:22:38,817
So I decided, if I was
gonna be the grown-up,

503
00:22:38,884 --> 00:22:40,669
I'd rather do it
on my own terms.

504
00:22:49,178 --> 00:22:51,829
Your mom knows
she messed up.

505
00:22:51,881 --> 00:22:54,215
She's determined
not to do it again.

506
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:56,067
Yeah.

507
00:22:56,135 --> 00:22:57,435
And she'll feel that way,

508
00:22:57,503 --> 00:22:59,120
right up until
things get too tough

509
00:22:59,188 --> 00:23:00,772
and she has to start
using again.

510
00:23:09,482 --> 00:23:11,733
Do you think
people can change?

511
00:23:11,817 --> 00:23:13,868
No.

512
00:23:13,953 --> 00:23:16,037
But I don't think that's
gonna change your opinion,

513
00:23:16,122 --> 00:23:18,907
because...
people don't change.

514
00:23:22,745 --> 00:23:23,962
Stop.

515
00:23:24,029 --> 00:23:26,097
<i>Is that an ulcer?</i>
Yeah, it is.

516
00:23:26,165 --> 00:23:27,532
But we haven't
reached the stomach yet.

517
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:29,401
I'm still high
in the esophagus.

518
00:23:29,468 --> 00:23:31,002
Means it's not
Zollinger-Ellison.

519
00:23:32,704 --> 00:23:34,339
<i>Ulcer's bleeding.</i>

520
00:23:34,390 --> 00:23:37,642
We need to lavage before
she drowns in her own blood.

521
00:23:41,552 --> 00:23:43,186
Cauterized the ulcer,
stopped the bleeding.

522
00:23:43,254 --> 00:23:45,064
Compromised immune system
from living on the street

523
00:23:45,067 --> 00:23:46,663
<i>could have made her</i>
<i>susceptible to HPV.</i>

524
00:23:46,664 --> 00:23:48,326
HPV was covered
on the STD panel.

525
00:23:48,329 --> 00:23:49,254
<i>She's negative.</i>

526
00:23:49,255 --> 00:23:51,222
What if she didn't
get this from being homeless?

527
00:23:51,423 --> 00:23:52,757
What if she got it
from her mom?

528
00:23:52,841 --> 00:23:54,959
I'm assuming you're thinking
something genetic, because--

529
00:23:55,043 --> 00:23:56,394
I'm thinking addiction.

530
00:23:56,462 --> 00:23:58,796
Alcohol-induced
esophagitis.

531
00:23:58,881 --> 00:24:00,748
Explains esophageal ulcers
and her other symptoms.

532
00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:02,350
If only
it would explain

533
00:24:02,417 --> 00:24:03,751
why we've never
seen her drunk,

534
00:24:03,802 --> 00:24:05,085
drinking, or detoxing.

535
00:24:05,137 --> 00:24:06,771
Her blood pressure's
been elevated.

536
00:24:06,855 --> 00:24:07,755
Could be the DTs.

537
00:24:07,806 --> 00:24:09,106
It's been mildly elevated.

538
00:24:09,191 --> 00:24:10,591
Mildly elevated BP

539
00:24:10,642 --> 00:24:13,110
could put her at risk
of a Berry aneurysm.

540
00:24:13,195 --> 00:24:15,029
Weak blood vessel
in the brain

541
00:24:15,096 --> 00:24:16,981
gets pounded on
by elevated BP,

542
00:24:17,065 --> 00:24:19,901
causes it to expand
and contract.

543
00:24:19,968 --> 00:24:22,003
<i>Causes the symptoms</i>
<i>to come and go.</i>

544
00:24:22,070 --> 00:24:24,071
CT didn't show any signs
of an aneurysm.

545
00:24:24,122 --> 00:24:26,123
Did I mention
they come and go?

546
00:24:26,208 --> 00:24:27,909
Much as your presence
may cause

547
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:29,794
objects to become
engorged with blood,

548
00:24:29,878 --> 00:24:32,463
sometimes aneurysms
just aren't in the mood.

549
00:24:32,548 --> 00:24:33,381
Alcoholism
and Berry aneurysm

550
00:24:33,448 --> 00:24:34,966
are both valid theories.

551
00:24:35,050 --> 00:24:36,467
I think we should discuss this
with the patient and her mom.

552
00:24:36,552 --> 00:24:37,969
Why? We discussed it
right here.

553
00:24:38,053 --> 00:24:39,637
Go tell 'em she needs
a cerebral angiogram

554
00:24:39,721 --> 00:24:40,972
to locate the aneurysm,

555
00:24:41,056 --> 00:24:43,591
then surgery to repair.

556
00:24:45,627 --> 00:24:46,761
Brain surgery?

557
00:24:46,828 --> 00:24:48,596
When?

558
00:24:48,647 --> 00:24:50,915
We booked the O.R.
for an hour from now.

559
00:24:50,983 --> 00:24:54,902
And Dr. House is sure
that's what she has?

560
00:24:54,970 --> 00:24:56,303
He's confident
in the diagnosis.

561
00:24:56,355 --> 00:24:58,305
It's consistent with
all of her symptoms.

562
00:25:00,141 --> 00:25:02,610
But you don't buy it.

563
00:25:02,661 --> 00:25:04,144
No.

564
00:25:04,196 --> 00:25:06,814
I think your symptoms
are the result

565
00:25:06,865 --> 00:25:09,316
of alcohol abuse.

566
00:25:09,368 --> 00:25:11,619
But I'm not--
I'm not an alcoholic.

567
00:25:11,670 --> 00:25:13,487
You came to the hospital
with beer in your pocket.

568
00:25:13,539 --> 00:25:15,122
We found more alcohol
at your house.

569
00:25:15,173 --> 00:25:16,541
Yeah, I use booze
as payment.

570
00:25:16,625 --> 00:25:18,609
I have an occasional beer
with my friends.

571
00:25:18,677 --> 00:25:20,828
That doesn't mean
I have a problem.

572
00:25:24,066 --> 00:25:25,800
I want the surgery.

573
00:25:25,867 --> 00:25:28,536
Actually,
it's your mom's decision.

574
00:25:34,910 --> 00:25:36,711
I'm not an addict.

575
00:25:36,778 --> 00:25:38,946
That's what I always
said to you, Callie,

576
00:25:38,997 --> 00:25:41,682
but I had a problem--
I'm nothing like you!

577
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:48,239
Tell them to do the surgery.

578
00:25:52,761 --> 00:25:55,296
I need a few minutes
to think.

579
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:02,903
The patient asked me
what I thought.

580
00:26:02,971 --> 00:26:05,306
I pay you to think
inside this room.

581
00:26:05,357 --> 00:26:06,941
Outside this room,
I pay you to parrot.

582
00:26:06,992 --> 00:26:08,943
It's her choice.
She has the right to know!

583
00:26:08,994 --> 00:26:10,578
<i>It's a medical choice</i>

584
00:26:10,645 --> 00:26:11,579
that you turned
into an extension

585
00:26:11,646 --> 00:26:13,364
of your baggage and hers.

586
00:26:13,448 --> 00:26:15,333
You told the mom something
you want to believe

587
00:26:15,417 --> 00:26:16,617
because you
don't want to believe

588
00:26:16,668 --> 00:26:18,502
that this girl might be
doing fine parent-free.

589
00:26:18,587 --> 00:26:20,121
Which also happens to be
what the mom wants to believe.

590
00:26:20,172 --> 00:26:21,589
You think she wants
to feel responsible

591
00:26:21,656 --> 00:26:23,124
for her daughter's illness?

592
00:26:23,175 --> 00:26:25,159
That woman sees everything to do
with her daughter through...

593
00:26:25,210 --> 00:26:27,261
Guilt-colored glasses.

594
00:26:27,329 --> 00:26:28,996
It's all her fault.

595
00:26:35,804 --> 00:26:38,556
House...

596
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:40,775
Don't...bully her.

597
00:26:40,842 --> 00:26:43,444
She's overwhelmed enough.

598
00:26:43,511 --> 00:26:44,612
Well, it's nothing compared
to how she's gonna feel

599
00:26:44,679 --> 00:26:46,314
when her daughter dies
from the aneurysm

600
00:26:46,365 --> 00:26:47,815
she decided not to treat.

601
00:27:07,135 --> 00:27:10,137
You must be Dr. House.

602
00:27:10,205 --> 00:27:11,839
I save my appearances

603
00:27:11,890 --> 00:27:13,841
for when parents are on
the brink of doing something

604
00:27:13,892 --> 00:27:16,477
incredibly stupid.

605
00:27:17,896 --> 00:27:19,847
Your daughter has
a Berry aneurysm.

606
00:27:19,898 --> 00:27:21,816
She needs surgery.

607
00:27:21,883 --> 00:27:23,901
What she does not need
is you making this

608
00:27:23,985 --> 00:27:27,104
or any other decision.

609
00:27:27,189 --> 00:27:28,906
Well, I can't just

610
00:27:28,990 --> 00:27:30,191
leave this up to her.

611
00:27:30,242 --> 00:27:31,359
Then leave it up to me,

612
00:27:31,410 --> 00:27:33,861
and just leave.

613
00:27:33,912 --> 00:27:35,396
Ohh.

614
00:27:35,447 --> 00:27:38,449
I'm not gonna
abandon my daughter.

615
00:27:38,533 --> 00:27:40,801
She hates you.

616
00:27:45,073 --> 00:27:46,374
It's actually not
such a big deal.

617
00:27:46,425 --> 00:27:48,175
There's plenty of kids
who hate their parents.

618
00:27:48,243 --> 00:27:53,214
What makes it a big deal
is that she should hate you.

619
00:27:53,265 --> 00:27:56,133
Playing the biology card
doesn't change anything

620
00:27:56,218 --> 00:27:57,635
except where she lives.

621
00:27:57,719 --> 00:28:00,304
Your daughter is better off
without you.

622
00:28:00,389 --> 00:28:03,774
So...let her be
better off without you.

623
00:28:09,431 --> 00:28:11,265
I'm gonna
do the surgery.

624
00:28:11,316 --> 00:28:13,784
I'll take the fallout
from Social Services.

625
00:28:33,638 --> 00:28:34,972
<i>Dr. House!</i>

626
00:28:43,064 --> 00:28:46,467
My daughter's care
is my choice.

627
00:28:46,518 --> 00:28:48,769
And so is this.

628
00:28:48,820 --> 00:28:50,938
Treat her
for alcoholism.

629
00:28:56,695 --> 00:28:57,711
Peek-a-boo!

630
00:28:57,779 --> 00:28:58,913
<i>Why would Anita</i>

631
00:28:58,980 --> 00:29:00,915
tell her husband
about our affair?

632
00:29:00,982 --> 00:29:02,950
Probably just
got sick of lying.

633
00:29:03,001 --> 00:29:04,351
<i>Look at it this way.</i>

634
00:29:04,419 --> 00:29:07,705
Now the sex is both
commitment- and guilt-free.

635
00:29:07,789 --> 00:29:10,624
And men love
commitment-free sex.

636
00:29:10,675 --> 00:29:12,510
Yes, they do.

637
00:29:12,594 --> 00:29:13,794
Oh, yes, they do!

638
00:29:16,715 --> 00:29:19,133
They're gonna
find out eventually.

639
00:29:19,184 --> 00:29:20,667
Peek-a-boo!

640
00:29:20,719 --> 00:29:22,186
Peek-a-boo!

641
00:29:22,270 --> 00:29:24,054
How do you keep doing
the same thing over and over

642
00:29:24,139 --> 00:29:25,539
with the same level
of enthusiasm?

643
00:29:25,607 --> 00:29:28,025
First off, be a decent,
empathetic person.

644
00:29:29,644 --> 00:29:30,528
<i>This is what you</i>
<i>said you wanted,</i>

645
00:29:30,612 --> 00:29:31,512
but you're
actually more upset

646
00:29:31,563 --> 00:29:32,730
now that
her husband knows.

647
00:29:32,814 --> 00:29:34,648
- 'Cause I'm hurting him.
- You always were.

648
00:29:34,699 --> 00:29:35,783
Yeah, but he didn't
know that.

649
00:29:35,850 --> 00:29:37,735
Which means
he wasn't really hurt.

650
00:29:37,819 --> 00:29:39,904
Yeah, I know
it's a rationalization,

651
00:29:39,988 --> 00:29:40,905
<i>but it went a long way</i>

652
00:29:40,989 --> 00:29:42,373
to making me feel...

653
00:29:42,457 --> 00:29:43,824
A little less guilty
about seeing her.

654
00:29:43,892 --> 00:29:44,792
<i>Looks like</i>
<i>you're gonna need</i>

655
00:29:44,860 --> 00:29:46,327
a bigger rationalization.

656
00:29:46,378 --> 00:29:48,095
Ahh...Peek-a-boo!

657
00:29:48,163 --> 00:29:50,831
<i>Peek-a-boo!</i>

658
00:29:52,534 --> 00:29:54,502
Social Services report
came in on your mom.

659
00:29:54,553 --> 00:29:55,636
Ah, let me guess.

660
00:29:55,703 --> 00:29:57,972
She passed
with flying colors.

661
00:29:58,039 --> 00:29:59,924
She always does.

662
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:03,561
I think she might
make it this time.

663
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:06,814
House left a bottle
of Vicodin

664
00:30:06,881 --> 00:30:08,482
to see if
she'd steal it.

665
00:30:08,550 --> 00:30:09,850
She gave it back.

666
00:30:14,489 --> 00:30:16,390
You could at least
let her sleep in the room.

667
00:30:16,458 --> 00:30:19,860
She could have listened to me
about my drinking.

668
00:30:19,928 --> 00:30:21,412
I mean, even if you are
right about it,

669
00:30:21,496 --> 00:30:23,163
why take your word
over mine?

670
00:30:23,231 --> 00:30:25,566
<i>I'm her daughter.</i>

671
00:30:25,617 --> 00:30:27,451
Because it...

672
00:30:27,536 --> 00:30:29,503
She's your mom.

673
00:30:29,571 --> 00:30:32,406
And, for the first time,
she's acting like it.

674
00:30:36,795 --> 00:30:39,013
It's a little late
for that.

675
00:30:41,516 --> 00:30:42,749
Good night.

676
00:31:00,541 --> 00:31:01,321
Morning!

677
00:31:01,322 --> 00:31:03,089
I heard you went
head-to-head with the mom.

678
00:31:03,157 --> 00:31:04,541
Not for your reasons.

679
00:31:04,625 --> 00:31:05,825
You're protecting
the girl.

680
00:31:05,877 --> 00:31:07,177
I'm protecting
my diagnosis.

681
00:31:07,261 --> 00:31:08,428
And you tested her--

682
00:31:08,495 --> 00:31:09,629
see if you could
get her back on drugs

683
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:10,797
and out of her
daughter's life.

684
00:31:10,848 --> 00:31:12,999
That was to show Adams
that mommie dearest

685
00:31:13,050 --> 00:31:14,301
hadn't changed.

686
00:31:14,352 --> 00:31:17,437
I'm taking a principled stand
against idealism.

687
00:31:17,504 --> 00:31:20,273
Your patient's stable?

688
00:31:20,341 --> 00:31:22,175
Well, maybe Adams
was right.

689
00:31:22,226 --> 00:31:23,944
The illness
is alcohol-related.

690
00:31:24,011 --> 00:31:25,278
Well, I hope so,

691
00:31:25,346 --> 00:31:27,063
considering it's what
we're treating her for.

692
00:31:27,148 --> 00:31:29,699
You--you hope
you're wrong

693
00:31:29,784 --> 00:31:32,369
for the sake
of the patient?

694
00:31:32,453 --> 00:31:34,020
I hope that I'm right

695
00:31:34,071 --> 00:31:37,357
but the aneurism bursts
without killing her.

696
00:31:37,408 --> 00:31:38,792
Call me a softie.

697
00:31:40,461 --> 00:31:43,079
Or the mom agrees
to an autopsy

698
00:31:43,164 --> 00:31:44,414
so I can prove it.

699
00:31:50,555 --> 00:31:52,989
Your patients love you
because you're empathetic.

700
00:31:54,759 --> 00:31:57,077
I also have kind eyes.

701
00:31:57,144 --> 00:31:58,511
Why are you here?

702
00:31:58,563 --> 00:32:00,213
But you don't love
all your patients?

703
00:32:01,966 --> 00:32:03,233
Of course not.

704
00:32:03,301 --> 00:32:05,885
I'll--I'll bet
some of them bore you.

705
00:32:05,937 --> 00:32:07,854
Dull people
get cancer too.

706
00:32:07,922 --> 00:32:09,189
Why are you here?

707
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:10,991
But you...fake
an interest in them

708
00:32:11,058 --> 00:32:12,659
because you needed to,
right?

709
00:32:12,726 --> 00:32:13,743
And if you do it
long enough,

710
00:32:13,828 --> 00:32:14,995
it becomes real?

711
00:32:15,062 --> 00:32:16,580
Well, no,

712
00:32:16,664 --> 00:32:19,499
because the interest
isn't fake.

713
00:32:19,566 --> 00:32:21,434
Really?

714
00:32:21,502 --> 00:32:24,704
Because you realize
they're not dull.

715
00:32:24,755 --> 00:32:26,790
It was just your
misinterpretation of them.

716
00:32:26,874 --> 00:32:30,410
I just haven't found a way
to make them interesting yet.

717
00:32:30,478 --> 00:32:31,878
It's all about
common ground.

718
00:32:31,929 --> 00:32:34,347
You found one thing
you both like or hate.

719
00:32:34,415 --> 00:32:35,581
John Woo movies,

720
00:32:35,633 --> 00:32:37,867
romance novels, kale.

721
00:32:41,355 --> 00:32:43,306
Sometimes, the best way
to connect with someone

722
00:32:43,391 --> 00:32:45,892
is stop thinking about them
and focus on yourself.

723
00:32:48,946 --> 00:32:50,730
Wh--uhh.
What is this about?

724
00:32:50,798 --> 00:32:53,533
Not everything
has an agenda.

725
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:54,451
See ya.

726
00:32:59,874 --> 00:33:02,208
I told him because
it was the right thing to do.

727
00:33:02,276 --> 00:33:03,326
Right.

728
00:33:03,411 --> 00:33:05,962
This doesn't change
anything between us.

729
00:33:06,047 --> 00:33:08,782
It sort of does for me.

730
00:33:10,418 --> 00:33:11,835
Y-you want to stop
seeing each other?

731
00:33:11,919 --> 00:33:13,820
No.

732
00:33:15,890 --> 00:33:18,024
I was thinking...

733
00:33:18,092 --> 00:33:21,311
Maybe you could tell
your husband that we did.

734
00:33:21,395 --> 00:33:24,230
And then go back
to sneaking around

735
00:33:24,298 --> 00:33:25,265
behind his back?

736
00:33:25,333 --> 00:33:27,633
Yes.

737
00:33:27,685 --> 00:33:30,136
Why would you
want to do that?

738
00:33:30,187 --> 00:33:32,572
I don't know.
I...

739
00:33:32,639 --> 00:33:35,442
This just feels...

740
00:33:35,493 --> 00:33:37,444
Wrong.

741
00:33:40,715 --> 00:33:42,716
I th--I think I'm gonna go.

742
00:34:00,834 --> 00:34:02,635
Ohh, God.

743
00:34:02,687 --> 00:34:05,605
We thought it was
the salt pork.

744
00:34:05,672 --> 00:34:07,857
But all the menfolk
been eatin' it,

745
00:34:07,942 --> 00:34:10,176
and we the only ones
that's sick.

746
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:21,371
Which one of you
is the cheap bastard?

747
00:34:23,324 --> 00:34:25,024
Your uniforms.

748
00:34:25,076 --> 00:34:27,193
<i>They're not wool.</i>
<i>They're polyester.</i>

749
00:34:27,244 --> 00:34:28,795
Cheap polyester.

750
00:34:28,862 --> 00:34:30,163
Which gets processed
with a heavy metal

751
00:34:30,214 --> 00:34:31,548
called antimony.

752
00:34:31,632 --> 00:34:33,550
You wear badly processed
polyester

753
00:34:33,634 --> 00:34:35,385
all day and night
for days and nights,

754
00:34:35,469 --> 00:34:36,720
you get
antimony poisoning

755
00:34:36,804 --> 00:34:38,671
<i>which caused your diarrhea</i>

756
00:34:38,723 --> 00:34:41,374
and your numbness
in your hands.

757
00:34:41,425 --> 00:34:43,093
And your
collective vomiting.

758
00:34:44,929 --> 00:34:47,430
Polyester uniforms?

759
00:34:47,515 --> 00:34:49,432
I was being authentic.

760
00:34:49,517 --> 00:34:51,401
With polyester uniforms?

761
00:34:51,485 --> 00:34:53,653
The Confederacy gave men
$21 every six months--

762
00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:55,721
- You poisoned us both.
- At least I have principles.

763
00:34:55,773 --> 00:34:57,273
Because they
don't cost anything.

764
00:34:57,358 --> 00:34:58,724
Brother against brother.

765
00:34:58,776 --> 00:35:00,326
Now, that is authentic.

766
00:35:15,259 --> 00:35:16,509
I know you don't
want me here,

767
00:35:16,577 --> 00:35:18,978
<i>but, um...</i>

768
00:35:19,046 --> 00:35:21,047
They had banana muffins
downstairs.

769
00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:27,270
Reminded me of our
St. Pete's trip.

770
00:35:27,354 --> 00:35:29,255
Remember?

771
00:35:29,306 --> 00:35:31,641
<i>We used to walk</i>
<i>and get some</i>

772
00:35:31,725 --> 00:35:33,059
every morning at that bakery.

773
00:35:36,447 --> 00:35:37,330
I guess.

774
00:35:47,608 --> 00:35:49,225
Were you high
on that trip?

775
00:35:53,497 --> 00:35:57,584
Not when
we were together.

776
00:35:57,635 --> 00:36:01,387
I used to wait
until you went to bed.

777
00:36:08,846 --> 00:36:10,430
You can stay.

778
00:36:10,481 --> 00:36:12,348
If you want.

779
00:36:15,636 --> 00:36:16,603
Okay.

780
00:36:25,312 --> 00:36:26,613
Mm. It's not bad.

781
00:36:31,085 --> 00:36:33,369
What's happening?

782
00:36:33,454 --> 00:36:35,088
Is this from
the alcohol treatment?

783
00:36:35,155 --> 00:36:36,506
I was wrong.

784
00:36:36,590 --> 00:36:38,041
The Berry aneurysm
must have just burst.

785
00:36:42,444 --> 00:36:44,112
Temporal lobes
are clear.

786
00:36:44,179 --> 00:36:45,179
Parietal, clear.

787
00:36:45,230 --> 00:36:46,847
Get me a micro-vascular
clip tray

788
00:36:46,899 --> 00:36:48,149
as well as the occlusion.

789
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:49,667
Check the ventricles.

790
00:36:49,735 --> 00:36:52,987
<i>Ventricles are clear too.</i>

791
00:36:53,038 --> 00:36:54,789
Aneurysm must have
leaked instead of burst.

792
00:36:54,857 --> 00:36:56,023
<i>Inject the dye.</i>

793
00:37:04,699 --> 00:37:07,051
Posterior cerebral clear.

794
00:37:07,136 --> 00:37:08,503
Vertebral clear.

795
00:37:08,554 --> 00:37:11,038
<i>Circle of Willis</i>
<i>also clear.</i>

796
00:37:11,089 --> 00:37:14,091
She doesn't have
a Berry aneurysm.

797
00:37:21,433 --> 00:37:23,100
Her BP's dropping.
Start her on pressors.

798
00:37:23,185 --> 00:37:24,352
<i>We gotta get her BP up</i>

799
00:37:24,403 --> 00:37:25,520
<i>before her organs</i>
<i>start shutting down.</i>

800
00:37:25,571 --> 00:37:28,739
Adams...with me.

801
00:37:28,824 --> 00:37:31,025
Pressors will only
give us a couple hours, Max.

802
00:37:31,076 --> 00:37:32,360
What causes
breathing issues,

803
00:37:32,411 --> 00:37:33,861
bleeding issues,
paralysis,

804
00:37:33,912 --> 00:37:35,279
loss of consciousness?

805
00:37:35,364 --> 00:37:36,697
What are we missing?

806
00:37:36,748 --> 00:37:37,949
That's everything bad
that's happened.

807
00:37:38,033 --> 00:37:39,167
What about
the good stuff?

808
00:37:39,234 --> 00:37:41,419
You mean like we should
be more optimistic?

809
00:37:41,503 --> 00:37:43,404
She got a little better
when we put her on steroids,

810
00:37:43,455 --> 00:37:44,705
which can attack
tumor cells.

811
00:37:44,756 --> 00:37:46,207
Maybe she has cancer.

812
00:37:46,258 --> 00:37:49,377
No hypercalcemia,
no elevated blood proteins.

813
00:37:49,428 --> 00:37:51,345
She and her mom mentioned
a trip they took to Florida

814
00:37:51,413 --> 00:37:53,431
a couple years ago--
what about dengue fever?

815
00:37:53,515 --> 00:37:54,682
Cholera?

816
00:37:54,749 --> 00:37:55,883
<i>Great ideas,</i>
<i>if dengue fever</i>

817
00:37:55,934 --> 00:37:57,301
or cholera laid in wait
for two years

818
00:37:57,386 --> 00:37:59,270
before suddenly...

819
00:38:10,616 --> 00:38:14,768
Did your biological daughter
go swimming in Florida?

820
00:38:14,820 --> 00:38:16,954
In a lake or a pond
or an everglade?

821
00:38:17,039 --> 00:38:18,406
Uh...Yeah.

822
00:38:18,457 --> 00:38:21,775
There's a canal
near my mother's house.

823
00:38:21,827 --> 00:38:23,744
Do you know
what's wrong with her?

824
00:38:23,795 --> 00:38:25,613
Family vacations kill.

825
00:38:26,948 --> 00:38:28,633
<i>Come with me.</i>

826
00:38:28,717 --> 00:38:31,452
Don't want
to explain this twice.

827
00:38:35,123 --> 00:38:37,141
You're letting in the flies.
And she needs an LVAD.

828
00:38:37,226 --> 00:38:38,926
No, she doesn't.

829
00:38:38,977 --> 00:38:41,512
Your daughter
has ascariasis.

830
00:38:41,597 --> 00:38:43,814
It's a disease caused
by a parasitic worm

831
00:38:43,899 --> 00:38:46,400
found in feces.

832
00:38:46,468 --> 00:38:48,185
Animals use the canal
as a potty,

833
00:38:48,270 --> 00:38:50,655
the eggs from the feces
ended up in Callie's intestines

834
00:38:50,739 --> 00:38:52,690
when she went swimming...

835
00:38:52,774 --> 00:38:53,858
<i>Where they hung out,</i>

836
00:38:53,942 --> 00:38:55,610
quietly and asymptomatically,

837
00:38:55,661 --> 00:38:57,995
biding their time till,
somewhere along the way,

838
00:38:58,080 --> 00:38:59,580
they got knocked loose.

839
00:38:59,648 --> 00:39:02,149
Maybe a dive
in volleyball practice

840
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:04,535
or maybe she slipped
on her way into a soup kitchen.

841
00:39:04,620 --> 00:39:05,953
But once they hatched,

842
00:39:06,004 --> 00:39:07,588
the worms got to work
on her lungs,

843
00:39:07,656 --> 00:39:09,507
her ear,
the nerves in her legs.

844
00:39:09,591 --> 00:39:11,959
The worms got agitated
by the steroids we gave her,

845
00:39:12,010 --> 00:39:14,512
which started them on their
journey to the esophagus

846
00:39:14,596 --> 00:39:17,765
and, ultimately,
to the heart.

847
00:39:17,832 --> 00:39:20,017
A few pills
of Mebendazole...

848
00:39:20,102 --> 00:39:21,636
She'll be fine.

849
00:39:30,679 --> 00:39:32,196
She's feeling much better.

850
00:39:32,281 --> 00:39:33,314
Walking on her own.

851
00:39:33,365 --> 00:39:34,565
Getting along
with her mother?

852
00:39:34,650 --> 00:39:36,284
As long as I keep
bringing her muffins.

853
00:39:38,203 --> 00:39:39,287
<i>Did someone come</i>

854
00:39:39,354 --> 00:39:40,905
take her for a test?

855
00:40:15,774 --> 00:40:17,908
Callie agrees with you...

856
00:40:17,993 --> 00:40:19,893
That people don't change.

857
00:40:19,945 --> 00:40:22,580
She said when her mom
slips again,

858
00:40:22,664 --> 00:40:23,897
<i>she didn't want</i>
<i>to be there.</i>

859
00:40:23,949 --> 00:40:27,118
<i>She'd rather remember her</i>
<i>like she is now.</i>

860
00:40:27,202 --> 00:40:28,502
Smart girl.

861
00:40:30,789 --> 00:40:32,239
You got the ending
you wanted.

862
00:40:32,290 --> 00:40:33,758
'Cause I was only looking
to solve the case,

863
00:40:33,842 --> 00:40:36,677
not their lives.

864
00:40:36,745 --> 00:40:38,629
Now, I don't care
if the people who work for me

865
00:40:38,714 --> 00:40:39,880
are screwed up.

866
00:40:39,931 --> 00:40:41,749
In fact,
I even encourage it.

867
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:44,051
But absolution?

868
00:40:44,102 --> 00:40:45,970
You do that
on your own time.

869
00:40:48,190 --> 00:40:50,107
Or not at all.

870
00:40:50,192 --> 00:40:52,643
'Cause...Clearly,
you suck at it.

871
00:41:07,959 --> 00:41:08,826
There.

872
00:41:29,648 --> 00:41:32,099
This is Aaron Rodgers.

873
00:41:32,167 --> 00:41:36,036
Wow, 127
quarterback rating.

874
00:41:36,104 --> 00:41:38,272
You know what sound
he makes?

875
00:41:38,340 --> 00:41:40,441
Grrrrr!

876
00:41:46,114 --> 00:41:47,865
Okay. Oy!

877
00:41:47,949 --> 00:41:49,250
Um...

878
00:41:51,119 --> 00:41:52,253
This...

879
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:54,088
is Terrell Owens.

880
00:41:54,155 --> 00:41:56,457
People call him "T.O."

881
00:41:56,508 --> 00:41:57,875
Do you know what sound
he makes?

882
00:41:57,959 --> 00:41:59,427
Wah!

883
00:41:59,494 --> 00:42:00,661
<i>Wah!</i>

884
00:42:00,712 --> 00:42:02,630
Wah! Wah! Wah!

885
00:42:02,681 --> 00:42:04,432
[Foy Vance's <i>Be the Song]</i>

886
00:42:04,499 --> 00:42:06,634
? And when you run

887
00:42:06,685 --> 00:42:08,836
This is Mark Sanchez.

888
00:42:08,887 --> 00:42:10,855
Do you know what sound
people make about him?

889
00:42:10,939 --> 00:42:12,640
Pffftt!

890
00:42:12,707 --> 00:42:16,861
? Then I will come

891
00:42:16,945 --> 00:42:18,145
? in dead of night

892
00:42:18,196 --> 00:42:21,482
Working late?

893
00:42:21,533 --> 00:42:24,618
Husband have her tonight?

894
00:42:24,686 --> 00:42:27,071
And every night.

895
00:42:27,155 --> 00:42:29,406
She broke it off.

896
00:42:29,491 --> 00:42:31,492
It's for the best.

897
00:42:31,543 --> 00:42:33,911
I'm not really
an affair guy after all.

898
00:42:33,995 --> 00:42:36,997
Sure you are, buddy.

899
00:42:37,048 --> 00:42:39,467
You just lost interest once
it stopped being an affair.

900
00:42:39,534 --> 00:42:41,034
That's why
you're relieved.

901
00:42:41,086 --> 00:42:43,387
But don't worry--
it's not gonna end here.

902
00:42:43,472 --> 00:42:46,974
You'll just have to get your
adrenaline fix somewhere else.

903
00:42:47,041 --> 00:42:48,058
When that doesn't
do it anymore,

904
00:42:48,143 --> 00:42:49,393
then you'll just...

905
00:42:49,478 --> 00:42:50,561
escalate things somehow.

906
00:42:52,731 --> 00:42:54,849
At least, that's
what I've been told.

907
00:42:57,686 --> 00:42:59,270
I'm not like you, House.

908
00:43:01,256 --> 00:43:03,491
True...No limp.

909
00:43:03,516 --> 00:43:07,516
