145
00:08:07,009 --> 00:08:09,427
And since I'm the only one

146

00:08:13,348 --> 00:08:17,435
No sign of stenosis

Every doctor, every diagnosis,

00:08:28,030 --> 00:08:29,914
Just like

155
00:08:29,981 --> 00:08:32,483

160
00:08:41,794 --> 00:08:43,795
I get it.

161

The more people we kill,
the more lives he saves.

162
00:08:46,882 --> 00:08:49,100
Test is negative

163
00:08:49,167 --> 00:08:51,302
her blood is not toxic.

164
00:08:51,353 --> 00:08:53,888
Then we should look for toxic
exposure from something else.

165
00:08:53,972 --> 00:08:56,841
You really think the hospital

00:09:27,923 --> 00:09:29,090
Ah. I'll let you drive.

178
00:09:29,174 --> 00:09:30,758
Not worth listening
to you whine

179
00:09:30,843 --> 00:09:32,376
about your feelings and fears
for three days.

180
00:09:32,427 --> 00:09:35,096
It's not gonna happen.
I've taken a vow.

181
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:39,300
People don't change.
You are a person, ergo, pass.

182
00:09:39,368 --> 00:09:42,270
Yes, that's why
I brought this.

183
00:09:42,354 --> 00:09:44,188
20 CCs of propofol.

184
00:09:44,239 --> 00:09:45,773
<i>You can accompany me</i>
<i>willingly,</i>

185
00:09:45,858 --> 00:09:47,224
<i>or I will,</i>
<i>when you least expect it,</i>

186
00:09:47,276 --> 00:09:50,328
inject the contents of this vial
into your bloodstream.

187
00:09:50,395 --> 00:09:52,730
<i>The fall might result</i>
<i>in a concussion,</i>

188
00:09:52,781 --> 00:09:53,998
or fractures,

189
00:09:54,065 --> 00:09:55,750
or you might get lucky

190
00:09:55,834 --> 00:09:57,335
and simply wake up
somewhere near Allentown

191
00:09:57,402 --> 00:09:58,836
<i>with a nasty headache.</i>

192
00:09:58,904 --> 00:10:00,254
<i>The choice is yours,</i>
<i>and in case you've forgotten,</i>

193
00:10:00,339 --> 00:10:02,740
I am indifferent.

194
00:10:02,791 --> 00:10:06,878
We leave tomorrow morning
at 8:00 a.m.

195
00:10:10,015 --> 00:10:11,248
No clots.

196
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:12,917
No gas.

197
00:10:12,968 --> 00:10:14,519
But we found
enough of this

198
00:10:14,586 --> 00:10:15,770
<i>to reanimate</i>
<i>the entire morgue.</i>

199
00:10:15,854 --> 00:10:17,421
He's jacked on caffeine.

200
00:10:17,472 --> 00:10:19,223
<i>Stimulant psychosis.</i>

201
00:10:19,274 --> 00:10:21,943
How many times do I
have to solve this case?

202
00:10:22,027 --> 00:10:24,979
So all we have to do is hydrate
and observe him for 24 hours.

203
00:10:25,063 --> 00:10:26,263
Why don't you tell him
it was your idea?

204
00:10:26,315 --> 00:10:29,266
He might warm up to you.

205
00:10:29,318 --> 00:10:33,103
If you get an ear in the mail,
it's probably mine.

206
00:10:35,574 --> 00:10:37,408
<i>My abdomen!</i>

207
00:10:37,459 --> 00:10:39,126
It's my abdomen!

208
00:10:39,211 --> 00:10:40,161
It's just the effects
of withdrawal.

209
00:10:40,245 --> 00:10:41,295
The pain is normal.

210
00:10:41,380 --> 00:10:43,381
No! No!

211
00:10:43,448 --> 00:10:44,882
This isn't right!

212
00:10:51,317 --> 00:10:52,901
Abdominal pain
and distention

213
00:10:52,968 --> 00:10:54,969
means we were wrong
about stimulant psychosis.

214
00:10:55,105 --> 00:10:56,939
It could be
coexistent problems.

215
00:10:57,023 --> 00:10:58,807
He might just have
an obstruction.

216
00:10:58,892 --> 00:11:01,694
You know what House says
about coincidences.

217
00:11:01,761 --> 00:11:03,529
I didn't feel any masses
when I examined him,

218
00:11:03,596 --> 00:11:05,114
and no bowel sounds.

219
00:11:05,198 --> 00:11:06,732
Where's House?

220
00:11:06,783 --> 00:11:08,984
He hasn't come in yet,
and neither has Wilson.

221
00:11:09,069 --> 00:11:10,703
I've already tried them
three times.

222
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:12,288
Here we go again.

223
00:11:12,372 --> 00:11:14,790
Diabetes could cause
nerve damage in his hand,

224
00:11:14,875 --> 00:11:16,825
and guts, and--

225
00:11:16,910 --> 00:11:18,294
<i>Except his glucose levels</i>
<i>are normal,</i>

226
00:11:18,378 --> 00:11:20,663
and he probably would've
mentioned he was a diabetic.

227
00:11:20,747 --> 00:11:22,114
What about
ulcerative colitis?

228
00:11:22,165 --> 00:11:23,666
Earlier attacks
caused thrombosis--

229
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:25,134
We already
looked for clots,

230
00:11:25,218 --> 00:11:29,838
and there was no blood
in his stool.

231
00:11:29,923 --> 00:11:34,727
Try him again.

232
00:11:58,919 --> 00:12:00,652
And Wilson's.

233
00:12:00,704 --> 00:12:05,124
Wherever they are,
they don't want to be disturbed.

235
00:12:08,161 --> 00:12:10,045

236
00:12:10,130 --> 00:12:13,098
? I been driving all night,
my hands wet on the wheel ?

237
00:12:13,166 --> 00:12:15,050
We take 78, we can do

238
00:12:15,135 --> 00:12:19,171
the "sweet treats and salty eats
snack food trail."

239
00:12:19,222 --> 00:12:21,340
My trip, my itinerary.

240
00:12:21,391 --> 00:12:23,108
<i>We have to cover</i>
<i>300 miles today</i>

241
00:12:23,176 --> 00:12:25,060

with plenty of time

242
00:12:25,145 --> 00:12:27,229
to catch Julie
by 4:00 tomorrow.

243
00:12:27,314 --> 00:12:29,114
And that thing I said
about letting you drive,

244
00:12:29,182 --> 00:12:30,616
I lied.

245
00:12:35,238 --> 00:12:37,039
What?

246
00:12:37,123 --> 00:12:39,124
I'm--I'm impressed.

247
00:12:39,192 --> 00:12:40,692
Not by that.

248
00:12:40,744 --> 00:12:44,546
But by your real effort
to maintain the facade.

249
00:12:44,631 --> 00:12:46,332
It's been almost an hour,

250
00:12:46,383 --> 00:12:49,201
and there's been no mention
of the elephant in the car.

251
00:12:49,252 --> 00:12:51,036
Well, I declined
the elephant option.

252
00:12:51,087 --> 00:12:52,704
Uh-huh.

253
00:12:52,756 --> 00:12:54,706
In three days,
you're gonna find out

254
00:12:54,758 --> 00:12:56,875
if you live or die.

255
00:12:56,926 --> 00:12:58,177
You don't want
to talk about it.

256
00:12:58,228 --> 00:12:59,762
No, but obviously you do.

257
00:12:59,846 --> 00:13:01,713
So, we're gonna
talk about it,

258
00:13:01,765 --> 00:13:03,599
but because I want to.

259
00:13:03,683 --> 00:13:05,351
I am neither
talking about it,

260
00:13:05,402 --> 00:13:06,735
<i>nor talking about</i>
<i>not talking about it.</i>

261
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:09,154
You are hard-wired
to talk about it.

262
00:13:09,222 --> 00:13:11,106
It's how you cope,
it's who you are.

263
00:13:11,191 --> 00:13:12,074
<i>Yeah, well,</i>

264
00:13:12,158 --> 00:13:13,826
from now on, I'm not me.

265
00:13:13,893 --> 00:13:16,228
I'm...
I'm...

00:13:16,279 --> 00:13:18,280
Kyle Calloway.

267
00:13:18,365 --> 00:13:21,583
I thought your porn name
was Rusty Packard.

268
00:13:21,668 --> 00:13:23,168
Kyle is roguish,
carefree,

269
00:13:23,236 --> 00:13:26,071
and shares no qualities
with James Wilson.

270
00:13:26,122 --> 00:13:30,793
Can Kyle drive stick?

271
00:13:32,429 --> 00:13:34,963
? And I'm sure
I've had enough ?

272
00:13:35,048 --> 00:13:38,684
? she sends me comfort
coming in from above ?

273
00:13:38,751 --> 00:13:40,302
Treiber won't let us
do anything without House.

274
00:13:40,387 --> 00:13:42,805
House just took himself
off the case.

275
00:13:42,889 --> 00:13:44,690
You said no bowel sounds
when you examined him.

276
00:13:44,757 --> 00:13:46,425
"No" like diminished,
or none at all?

277
00:13:46,476 --> 00:13:48,260
- None.
- You think it's an intussusception?

278
00:13:48,311 --> 00:13:50,813
If it is, it could mean
cancer's behind everything.

279
00:13:50,897 --> 00:13:52,147
Let's get a plain film
of his abdomen.

280
00:13:52,232 --> 00:13:53,782
Treiber will refuse
any procedure

281
00:13:53,867 --> 00:13:55,651
that wasn't
ordered by House.

282
00:13:55,735 --> 00:13:57,119
Only if he knows
it wasn't.

283
00:13:57,203 --> 00:13:58,737
You want to lie to a guy

284
00:13:58,788 --> 00:14:00,906
whose favorite pastime
is getting doctors fired.

285
00:14:00,957 --> 00:14:03,042
We're adults with
advanced medical training,

286
00:14:03,109 --> 00:14:05,127
not children left alone
with scissors.

287
00:14:05,211 --> 00:14:07,913
It's one X-ray.

288
00:14:12,969 --> 00:14:15,637
<i>If we had a phone,</i>

289
00:14:15,722 --> 00:14:18,223
we could've found somewhere
a little less charming.

290
00:14:18,291 --> 00:14:19,975
If we had a phone,
you'd be making calls,

291
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:22,961
downloading porn,
and playing <i>Angry Birds.</i>

292
00:14:23,012 --> 00:14:25,814
This trip is about me,
and I like this place.

293
00:14:25,899 --> 00:14:27,599
This is not about you
not wanting me to have a phone.

294
00:14:27,667 --> 00:14:28,967
You're weak.

295
00:14:29,018 --> 00:14:30,769
<i>You knew that</i>
<i>you'd backslide</i>

296
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:35,324

teary ex-wives and your parents,

297
00:14:35,408 --> 00:14:37,693
<i>trying to make them feel better</i>
<i>about you being sick.</i>

298
00:14:37,777 --> 00:14:40,245
Bacon burger

299
00:14:40,313 --> 00:14:41,697
I'll have that.

300
00:14:41,781 --> 00:14:45,684
I'll have the Big One.

301
00:14:47,036 --> 00:14:49,671
You sure? It's $79.

302
00:14:49,756 --> 00:14:50,789
Unless I finish it
in an hour,

303
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:54,159
<i>in which case,</i>
<i>it's free.</i>

304
00:14:54,210 --> 00:14:56,261
It's an 80-ounce steak.

305
00:14:56,329 --> 00:14:58,464
I'm hungry.
And an iced tea, please.

306
00:14:58,515 --> 00:15:02,501
Big One's up!

307
00:15:06,339 --> 00:15:08,807
This place doesn't
take credit cards.

308
00:15:08,858 --> 00:15:10,609
My meal
is going to be free,

309
00:15:10,676 --> 00:15:14,396
and I'm going to be inducted
into the wall of pain.

310
00:15:19,068 --> 00:15:22,237
Hello, Kyle.

311
00:15:23,907 --> 00:15:25,374
Belly film was normal.

312
00:15:25,458 --> 00:15:27,576
No sign of an intussusception
or any other obstruction.

313
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:29,261
House says it's there.

314
00:15:29,329 --> 00:15:31,130
Sometimes House is wrong.

315
00:15:31,197 --> 00:15:33,698
Run my bowel.

316
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:35,134
That's serious surgery.

317
00:15:35,201 --> 00:15:37,252
General anesthesia,
long recovery...

318
00:15:37,337 --> 00:15:39,538
We can do a contrast enema
if you need more proof.

319
00:15:39,589 --> 00:15:42,207
I have drawers filled
with people who had clean scans.

320
00:15:42,258 --> 00:15:44,042
I know how easy it is
to miss something

321
00:15:44,093 --> 00:15:47,012
<i>unless you use your own</i>
<i>hands and eyes; Run my bowel.</i>

322
00:15:47,063 --> 00:15:49,064
We'll let House know
how you feel.

323
00:15:49,149 --> 00:15:52,551
How I feel is twisted
in white-hot agony.

324
00:15:52,602 --> 00:15:54,787
His orders were to look
for an intussusception.

325
00:15:54,854 --> 00:15:58,524
<i>Until you actually do that,</i>
<i>I refuse any other tests.</i>

326
00:15:58,575 --> 00:15:59,691
Fine.

327
00:15:59,742 --> 00:16:02,244
Uh, no. Not fine.
We need to talk--

328
00:16:02,328 --> 00:16:05,581
And I want you
to do the surgery.

329
00:16:05,665 --> 00:16:10,419
Statistically, you're the best
surgeon in the hospital.

330
00:16:13,873 --> 00:16:15,574
Kyle! Kyle! Kyle!

331
00:16:15,625 --> 00:16:16,675
Come on, you got this!

332
00:16:16,742 --> 00:16:17,726
You got this!

333
00:16:17,794 --> 00:16:18,994
<i>Come on!</i>

334
00:16:19,062 --> 00:16:20,012
25 seconds.

335
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:22,097
You've got this.

336
00:16:22,182 --> 00:16:24,600
Come on, home stretch,
Kyle, home stretch!

337
00:16:24,684 --> 00:16:25,968
15 seconds!

338
00:16:28,721 --> 00:16:29,938
Now, don't chew,
just swallow.

339
00:16:30,023 --> 00:16:31,190
Muscle it down!

340
00:16:31,257 --> 00:16:32,474
Six, five...

341
00:16:32,542 --> 00:16:33,725
Four...

342
00:16:33,776 --> 00:16:34,610
For the love of God,
swallow!

343
00:16:34,694 --> 00:16:37,646
Three, two, one...

344
00:16:37,730 --> 00:16:41,266
Time!

345
00:16:43,987 --> 00:16:47,155
Yes! Yes!

346
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:50,325
Oh, you magnificent
bastard!

347
00:16:50,410 --> 00:16:52,277
Yeah.
<i>Smile!</i>

348
00:17:00,786 --> 00:17:02,971
That still counts,
though, right?

349
00:17:11,564 --> 00:17:12,848
No hard feelings, right?

350
00:17:12,932 --> 00:17:14,850
You'll find out
when you wake up.

351
00:17:14,934 --> 00:17:17,636
If you really think
I'm a good doctor,

352
00:17:17,687 --> 00:17:19,154
why do you treat me
like an idiot?

353
00:17:19,239 --> 00:17:21,806
It's not because
you lack talent.

354
00:17:21,858 --> 00:17:24,159
<i>It's 'cause</i>
<i>you've wasted it.</i>

355
00:17:24,244 --> 00:17:26,194
Did you know I applied
to be a fellow with House

356
00:17:26,279 --> 00:17:27,312
the same year as you?

357
00:17:27,363 --> 00:17:29,814
No.

358
00:17:29,866 --> 00:17:33,085
Quit my other program,
relocated,

359
00:17:33,152 --> 00:17:34,819
broke up with
my girlfriend.

360
00:17:34,871 --> 00:17:38,090
Then your father made a call,
and suddenly you had the spot.

361
00:17:38,157 --> 00:17:39,625
That was almost
ten years ago.

362
00:17:39,676 --> 00:17:40,709
Do you know what
I could've done

363
00:17:40,793 --> 00:17:42,094
after even three years
with House?

364
00:17:42,161 --> 00:17:45,047
Gone to the CDC, W.H.O.

365
00:17:45,131 --> 00:17:47,015
Started a diagnostics
department

366
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:49,834
someplace they'd never even
heard of such a thing.

367
00:17:49,886 --> 00:17:52,271
You've been given
everything.

368
00:17:52,338 --> 00:17:55,140
<i>Looks, talent,</i>

369
00:17:55,191 --> 00:17:59,027
my future.

370
00:17:59,112 --> 00:18:03,865
Nine years later,
look what you've done with it.

371
00:18:14,026 --> 00:18:15,860
Ah...

372
00:18:15,912 --> 00:18:18,580
Must be nice to be puking
for the old-fashioned reasons.

373
00:18:22,868 --> 00:18:24,803
Ah.

374
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:26,755
I'm glad I did it.

375
00:18:26,839 --> 00:18:28,540
You see those people
out there cheering for me?

376
00:18:28,591 --> 00:18:29,925
I was a hero.

377
00:18:30,009 --> 00:18:31,677
For one fleeting moment,

378
00:18:31,728 --> 00:18:34,012
for an incredibly
stupid reason,

379
00:18:34,063 --> 00:18:37,649
for a bunch of morons
I'll never see again.

380
00:18:39,885 --> 00:18:43,739
God, it felt good.

381
00:18:45,658 --> 00:18:48,744
And now,
if you'll excuse me.

382
00:18:48,828 --> 00:18:53,565
I think I've made
room for dessert.

383
00:19:04,844 --> 00:19:07,846
How long do you think
you'll work for House?

384
00:19:07,913 --> 00:19:08,913
As long as he lets me.

385
00:19:08,965 --> 00:19:10,549
When House was in prison,

386
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:12,968
you worked at Mercy
in plastics, right?

387
00:19:13,052 --> 00:19:14,853
Know what I did?

388
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:18,056
Surfed.
For nine months.

389
00:19:18,107 --> 00:19:20,609
Yes, and if I didn't have
two daughters and alimony,

390
00:19:20,693 --> 00:19:22,144
I might have
done the same.

391
00:19:22,228 --> 00:19:25,063
A fellowship's supposed to
train you to stand on your own.

392
00:19:25,114 --> 00:19:26,648
Foreman's Dean
of the hospital,

393
00:19:26,733 --> 00:19:28,316
Cameron's head of emergency
medicine in Chicago.

394
00:19:28,401 --> 00:19:30,152
And Kutner and Amber
are dead,

395
00:19:30,236 --> 00:19:33,989
and Thirteen is having sweet,
sapphic sex on some island.

396
00:19:34,073 --> 00:19:35,123
Look at this.

397
00:19:35,208 --> 00:19:37,159
The small intestine.

398
00:19:37,243 --> 00:19:41,446
Is it an intussusception?

399
00:19:41,497 --> 00:19:42,631
No.

400
00:19:42,715 --> 00:19:45,050
Guess Treiber was right.

401
00:19:48,776 --> 00:19:49,842
He hasn't checked
his voicemail.

402
00:19:49,893 --> 00:19:51,177
Or his email.

403
00:19:51,228 --> 00:19:53,446
It's been
almost 24 hours.

404
00:19:53,513 --> 00:19:55,231
<i>Shouldn't we call</i>
<i>Foreman or the police?</i>

405
00:19:55,315 --> 00:19:56,532
<i>I think this</i>
<i>makes him a fugitive.</i>

406
00:19:56,617 --> 00:19:59,118
We don't have to
tell anyone.

407
00:19:59,186 --> 00:20:01,154
Treiber's symptoms
started in his frontal lobe,

408
00:20:01,205 --> 00:20:03,906
and moved through his nervous
system, hands, bowels, muscles.

409
00:20:03,991 --> 00:20:06,358
Intermittent porphyria.
<i>He's in the middle of an attack.</i>

410
00:20:06,410 --> 00:20:07,994
The longer we wait
to treat with hemin,

411
00:20:08,045 --> 00:20:09,545
<i>the more damage it causes.</i>

412
00:20:09,630 --> 00:20:11,363
The longer we wait to tell him
House isn't running the case,

413
00:20:11,415 --> 00:20:12,965
the more damage that causes.

414
00:20:13,033 --> 00:20:14,366
<i>It's fraud.</i>

415
00:20:14,418 --> 00:20:16,269
It's only an issue
if we're wrong.

416
00:20:16,270 --> 00:20:17,754
It's more than one X-ray.

417
00:20:17,822 --> 00:20:20,023
More than exploratory
surgery, even.

418
00:20:20,090 --> 00:20:22,673
This is a drug that will
damage him if you're wrong.

419
00:20:22,710 --> 00:20:24,428
Same principle.

420
00:20:27,998 --> 00:20:31,000
[Steppenwolf's <i>Rock Me]</i>

421
00:20:31,052 --> 00:20:36,640
? ?

422
00:20:36,691 --> 00:20:40,360
? she asked me maybe
I could share her sorrow ?

423
00:20:40,445 --> 00:20:42,195
I want a threesome.

424
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:43,947
Shouldn't we try
a twosome first?

425
00:20:44,014 --> 00:20:45,816
Two women.

426
00:20:45,867 --> 00:20:48,518
Oh.
<i>I know they're probably overrated,</i>

427
00:20:48,569 --> 00:20:50,821
and I'll probably
be gravely disappointed,

428
00:20:50,872 --> 00:20:52,021
but I want one anyway.

429
00:20:52,073 --> 00:20:53,824
No, you don't.

430
00:20:53,875 --> 00:20:55,742
Well, Kyle wants one.

431
00:20:55,827 --> 00:20:59,296
Kyle's only one day old.
He doesn't know what he wants.

432
00:20:59,363 --> 00:21:01,865
I don't want to think
about consequences.

433
00:21:01,916 --> 00:21:04,200
I don't want
to think about--

434
00:21:04,252 --> 00:21:06,303
I don't want to think
about anything.

435
00:21:06,370 --> 00:21:09,673
I just want to do.

436
00:21:09,724 --> 00:21:12,225
? Rock me, baby,
rock me, baby ?

437
00:21:12,310 --> 00:21:13,894
? all night long ?

438
00:21:13,978 --> 00:21:15,929
? rock me, baby ?
okay.

439
00:21:16,013 --> 00:21:18,732
I need you to do exactly
what I tell you.

440
00:21:18,816 --> 00:21:21,384
? Rock me, baby,
all night long ?

441
00:21:21,435 --> 00:21:22,819
? rock me, baby,
rock me, baby ?

442
00:21:22,887 --> 00:21:23,854
Yeah, yeah.

443
00:21:26,190 --> 00:21:27,491
Porphyria?

444
00:21:27,558 --> 00:21:29,225
I know the anesthesia
makes it hard to focus,

445
00:21:29,277 --> 00:21:33,163
but we need to start you
on hemin right away.

446
00:21:35,950 --> 00:21:38,568
House believes
very strongly.

447
00:21:38,619 --> 00:21:41,605
This is the right call.

448
00:21:43,674 --> 00:21:44,975
Okay.

449
00:21:53,601 --> 00:21:55,519
? ?

450
00:21:55,586 --> 00:21:56,686
This thing is peeling.

451
00:21:56,754 --> 00:21:59,139
Well, that is
the cost of cowardice.

452
00:21:59,223 --> 00:22:00,640
Should've gone
for the real thing.

453
00:22:00,725 --> 00:22:02,559
I feel like I'm cheating.

454
00:22:02,610 --> 00:22:05,061
A, it is only cheating
if you don't have cancer,

455
00:22:05,112 --> 00:22:07,013
and B,
it's Wednesday afternoon.

456
00:22:07,081 --> 00:22:08,231
Pickings are slim,

457
00:22:08,282 --> 00:22:10,116
and more importantly,
sober.

458
00:22:10,201 --> 00:22:14,704
The cancer cut is the surest way
to the pity pooty party.

459
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:19,776
One down, one to go.

460
00:22:19,827 --> 00:22:21,177
What?
Wait, wait, wait.

461
00:22:21,245 --> 00:22:22,879
She said yes?

462
00:22:22,947 --> 00:22:24,113
To a threesome?

463
00:22:24,165 --> 00:22:26,182
She's empathetic.

464
00:22:26,250 --> 00:22:28,284
She's a hooker.

465
00:22:28,336 --> 00:22:30,053
- Gave me a cancer rate.
- No.

466
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:32,205
I have never paid
for sex in my life.

467
00:22:32,273 --> 00:22:33,723
You still haven't.

468
00:22:33,791 --> 00:22:36,176
It's my treat.

469
00:22:36,260 --> 00:22:37,928
It's either that, or you find
two very open-minded women

470
00:22:37,995 --> 00:22:41,598
to fall in love with you
in the next hour.

471
00:22:46,604 --> 00:22:49,773
Bartender seems nice.

472
00:22:49,824 --> 00:22:52,492
Seems female.

473
00:22:52,577 --> 00:22:55,829
Want something to eat?

474
00:22:55,913 --> 00:22:58,531
My friend is dying
of cancer.

475
00:22:58,599 --> 00:23:01,117
Oh, you poor thing.

476
00:23:01,168 --> 00:23:04,170
It took my mother
two years ago.

477
00:23:04,255 --> 00:23:06,756
But you can't
give up hope.

478
00:23:06,824 --> 00:23:10,710
He's pretty much resigned.

479
00:23:10,795 --> 00:23:14,264
Just wants to go out
with a bang.

480
00:23:14,331 --> 00:23:17,450
And another pun,
what time do you get off?

481
00:23:25,026 --> 00:23:26,860
Pleural effusions.
It's not porphyria.

482
00:23:26,944 --> 00:23:29,062
We're gonna need
to put in a chest tube.

483
00:23:29,146 --> 00:23:30,697
I wanna talk to House.

484
00:23:30,781 --> 00:23:31,698
We'll tell him exactly
what's happening.

485
00:23:31,782 --> 00:23:32,682
<i>I wanna talk to him!</i>

486
00:23:32,733 --> 00:23:34,701
I want House.

487
00:23:34,785 --> 00:23:37,287
Where is House?

488
00:23:37,354 --> 00:23:39,188
<i>Where is he?</i>

489
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:41,524
<i>Where's House?</i>

490
00:23:41,575 --> 00:23:43,076
We don't know.

491
00:24:02,212 --> 00:24:05,181
You didn't have to
sleep out here.

492
00:24:05,232 --> 00:24:07,050
Four's a crowd.

493
00:24:07,101 --> 00:24:08,718
Apparently they left
a long time ago.

494
00:24:08,769 --> 00:24:11,237
So, how was it?

495
00:24:11,322 --> 00:24:14,057
Was the amateur
as good as the pro?

496
00:24:14,108 --> 00:24:17,027
It was confusing.

497
00:24:17,078 --> 00:24:18,561
Perfunctory.

498
00:24:18,612 --> 00:24:20,530
- A bit sad.
- Never mind.

499
00:24:20,581 --> 00:24:24,000
And exactly
what I needed.

500
00:24:24,068 --> 00:24:26,703
Thank you.

501
00:24:26,771 --> 00:24:29,756
You feel like
buying me breakfast?

502
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:33,410
One of them
stole my wallet.

503
00:24:36,249 --> 00:24:37,699
You're lucky he's not
pressing charges.

504
00:24:37,786 --> 00:24:39,486
Porphyria
was a legitimate call.

505
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:41,937
Until
the pleural effusions.

506
00:24:42,005 --> 00:24:43,455
We've done everything House
would've done if he'd been here.

507
00:24:43,523 --> 00:24:46,158
You lied to a patient.

508
00:24:46,209 --> 00:24:49,027
Treiber's condition
is declining rapidly.

509
00:24:49,079 --> 00:24:50,862
He's agreed to let me
take over the case.

510
00:24:50,914 --> 00:24:52,748
Dr. Chase will have no further
contact with the patient.

511
00:24:52,832 --> 00:24:54,383
Fine.

512
00:24:54,467 --> 00:24:57,136
<i>I didn't say you were</i>
<i>off the case.</i>

513
00:24:57,203 --> 00:25:00,422
Sit down.

514
00:25:00,507 --> 00:25:02,057
Ordered a cardiac MRI.

515
00:25:02,142 --> 00:25:03,559
Enlargement
of the left ventricle

516
00:25:03,643 --> 00:25:06,011
suggests an infiltrative
disease.

517
00:25:06,062 --> 00:25:07,846
It's sarcoidosis.

518
00:25:07,897 --> 00:25:09,431
We'll start him
on corticosteroids

519
00:25:09,516 --> 00:25:11,350
<i>and do a cardiac biopsy</i>
<i>to confirm.</i>

520
00:25:11,401 --> 00:25:12,851
<i>I disagree. I was wrong</i>
<i>about the porphyria,</i>

521
00:25:12,902 --> 00:25:14,886
but I wasn't wrong
about the nervous system.

522
00:25:14,938 --> 00:25:16,405
It's a Prion disease.

523
00:25:16,489 --> 00:25:18,557
That's why his symptoms
have progressed so rapidly.

524
00:25:18,608 --> 00:25:20,058
It's possible he was exposed
and didn't know it.

525
00:25:20,110 --> 00:25:21,560
Brains are often stored

526
00:25:21,628 --> 00:25:23,329
<i>and not tested</i>
<i>until weeks after autopsy.</i>

527
00:25:23,396 --> 00:25:25,197
Treiber's too good to not
take the right precautions.

528
00:25:25,248 --> 00:25:27,333
Maybe the problem is
he thinks the same thing.

529
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:29,234
His job's built
on the premise

530
00:25:29,286 --> 00:25:31,120
that doctors make mistakes;
That includes him.

531
00:25:31,204 --> 00:25:32,087
We should do
a brain biopsy.

532
00:25:32,172 --> 00:25:33,339
In his condition?

533
00:25:33,406 --> 00:25:34,373
Then we biopsy
the brains in the morgue.

534
00:25:34,424 --> 00:25:35,624
Find the one
that exposed him.

535
00:25:35,709 --> 00:25:36,759
It's a needle
in a haystack.

536
00:25:36,843 --> 00:25:37,843
There's four of us.

537
00:25:37,910 --> 00:25:39,178
Come on,
we can at least

538
00:25:39,245 --> 00:25:40,963
start him on amphotericin
to halt the progress

539
00:25:41,047 --> 00:25:42,598
while you do
your heart biopsy.

540
00:25:42,682 --> 00:25:44,350
No, we can't. Amphotericin
plus the contrast dye

541
00:25:44,417 --> 00:25:46,719
<i>for the biopsy</i>
<i>would overwhelm his kidneys.</i>

542
00:25:46,770 --> 00:25:49,888
We have to choose
one or the other.

543
00:25:49,956 --> 00:25:52,858
Biopsy his heart.

544
00:25:59,733 --> 00:26:02,151
Wallets go in
the minibar freezer.

545
00:26:02,235 --> 00:26:05,070
If there's no minibar,
the toilet tank.

546
00:26:05,121 --> 00:26:07,990
I've got exactly $20 left.

547
00:26:08,074 --> 00:26:10,709
I'm sorry, I wasn't familiar
with hooker protocol.

548
00:26:10,777 --> 00:26:12,411
We can use
your credit cards.

549
00:26:12,462 --> 00:26:14,463
No, we won't.

550
00:26:14,547 --> 00:26:15,881
I'm still on probation.

551
00:26:15,948 --> 00:26:17,549
Leaving the state
without permission

552
00:26:17,617 --> 00:26:18,450
<i>will really P.O.</i>
<i>my P.O.</i>

553
00:26:18,501 --> 00:26:20,803
Doesn't matter.

554
00:26:20,887 --> 00:26:23,889
We can't even afford
gas to get home.

555
00:26:23,956 --> 00:26:25,391
We're three hours
behind schedule.

556
00:26:25,458 --> 00:26:27,292
We have enough gas
to get to Julie.

557
00:26:27,344 --> 00:26:29,728
I don't care
about anything else.

558
00:26:32,232 --> 00:26:34,400
What this time?

559
00:26:34,467 --> 00:26:37,469
Just wondering how long
this can last.

560
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:39,471
You're still hoping
that I'm gonna wake up

561
00:26:39,522 --> 00:26:41,190
and admit that
Kyle Calloway is just

562
00:26:41,274 --> 00:26:43,308
some lame excuse to have
some naughty thrills aren't you?

563
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:46,745
I'm actually
hoping you won't.

564
00:26:46,813 --> 00:26:48,647
I like Kyle.

565
00:27:35,879 --> 00:27:38,997
Oh, come on.

566
00:28:30,049 --> 00:28:32,935
[Motorhead's
<i>Ace of Spades]</i>

567
00:28:33,019 --> 00:28:37,272
? ?

568
00:28:37,357 --> 00:28:42,311
Move! Move!

569
00:28:42,395 --> 00:28:46,097
Whoo!

570
00:28:46,149 --> 00:28:51,003
Whoo-hoo!

571
00:28:56,793 --> 00:28:57,926
Whoo!

572
00:29:00,380 --> 00:29:02,280
? The only card I need ?

573
00:29:02,332 --> 00:29:03,465
? is the ace of spades ?

574
00:29:03,550 --> 00:29:06,919
? the ace of spades ?

575
00:29:06,970 --> 00:29:10,806
? ?

576
00:29:24,821 --> 00:29:28,524
House.

577
00:29:28,608 --> 00:29:30,308
You okay?

578
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:32,661
My leg still hurts.

579
00:29:38,918 --> 00:29:41,286
Come on.

580
00:29:41,337 --> 00:29:45,156
We got 20 bucks
to go 11 miles.

581
00:29:58,304 --> 00:30:00,822
Why aren't you
answering your pages?

582
00:30:00,890 --> 00:30:02,173
Busy.

583
00:30:02,225 --> 00:30:05,477
The biopsy showed fibrosis
in his cardiac muscle.

584
00:30:05,528 --> 00:30:07,613
So it's not
a Prion disease.

585
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:09,398
<i>It means Foreman</i>
<i>was wrong too.</i>

586
00:30:09,482 --> 00:30:12,651
He wants everyone to meet
in his office to DDX.

587
00:30:12,702 --> 00:30:15,037
So he can tell us all
it's an infection?

588
00:30:15,121 --> 00:30:18,540
Interesting.
Or maybe you should consider

589
00:30:18,625 --> 00:30:20,125
<i>not being such a baby.</i>

590
00:30:20,192 --> 00:30:22,044
First instinct was
an exposure from a corpse.

591
00:30:22,128 --> 00:30:26,965
Treiber spends
all his time here.

592
00:30:27,033 --> 00:30:28,550
If it's not toxic gas,

593
00:30:28,635 --> 00:30:30,202
<i>not Prions...</i>

594
00:30:30,270 --> 00:30:31,136
Then it has to be
something else.

595
00:30:31,203 --> 00:30:32,554
He's not perfect.

596
00:30:32,639 --> 00:30:35,223
Are you trying to cure him
or discredit him?

597
00:30:35,308 --> 00:30:37,309
Treiber can only see me
as not House.

598
00:30:37,376 --> 00:30:39,728
Foreman too.

599
00:30:39,812 --> 00:30:41,396
And they're not wrong.

600
00:30:41,481 --> 00:30:45,100
So you're not
coming upstairs.

601
00:30:45,184 --> 00:30:48,070
No.

602
00:30:48,154 --> 00:30:51,089
And when this case
is over,

603
00:30:51,157 --> 00:30:53,825
I'm quitting.

604
00:30:59,717 --> 00:31:00,805
He's not quitting.

605
00:31:00,806 --> 00:31:02,662
He already called
other hospitals.

606
00:31:02,762 --> 00:31:03,762
Treiber did get
under his skin.

607
00:31:03,830 --> 00:31:05,497
He'll get over it.

608
00:31:05,548 --> 00:31:07,933
Fibrosis has to be
a response to an infection.

609
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,552
Chase said
you'd say that.

610
00:31:10,637 --> 00:31:12,521
We'll test the biopsy samples
for viruses

611
00:31:12,605 --> 00:31:15,974
and start him
on antivirals.

612
00:31:16,025 --> 00:31:17,693
You're not even
gonna talk to Chase?

613
00:31:17,777 --> 00:31:19,611
He didn't leave after
he got stabbed in the heart.

614
00:31:19,679 --> 00:31:20,846
I think we're okay.

615
00:31:20,897 --> 00:31:22,064
Either you're right,

616
00:31:22,148 --> 00:31:23,982
and your friend
is just really upset,

617
00:31:24,033 --> 00:31:27,069
or you're wrong, and he's come
at this calmly and rationally,

618
00:31:27,153 --> 00:31:28,987
and you're about to
lose a good doctor.

619
00:31:29,038 --> 00:31:31,874
Either way...

620
00:31:49,208 --> 00:31:52,678
This is Oubliette, Ohio.

621
00:31:52,729 --> 00:31:55,147
Buses don't run here
after 1968.

622
00:31:55,214 --> 00:31:57,983
Ina said there's a bus
every 15 minutes.

623
00:31:58,050 --> 00:32:01,052
Ina is living
in Alzheimersville.

624
00:32:01,104 --> 00:32:03,572
Been here at least
half an hour.

625
00:32:03,656 --> 00:32:06,074
Where are you going,
Ina?

626
00:32:06,159 --> 00:32:07,659
Naples, Florida.

627
00:32:07,727 --> 00:32:11,062
Ben and I have a beautiful
three-bedroom condo.

628
00:32:11,114 --> 00:32:12,731
All on the one floor.

629
00:32:12,782 --> 00:32:14,616
You're waiting
for a bus to Naples?

630
00:32:14,701 --> 00:32:17,736
Comes every 15 minutes.

631
00:32:17,804 --> 00:32:21,623
<i>Ben'll be wondering</i>
<i>where his dinner is.</i>

632
00:32:21,708 --> 00:32:24,710
Cab.

633
00:32:24,761 --> 00:32:27,078
Whoa, cab!

634
00:32:27,130 --> 00:32:31,800
20 bucks, 11 miles.
Come on.

635
00:32:33,553 --> 00:32:35,187
<i>Come on, let's go.</i>

636
00:32:35,254 --> 00:32:37,522
Julie's gonna be
at the clinic

637
00:32:37,590 --> 00:32:41,476
<i>for another 45 minutes;</i>
<i>We can make this.</i>

638
00:32:41,561 --> 00:32:45,030
She thinks
she's in Florida.

639
00:32:46,616 --> 00:32:48,734
Okay, bring her with.

640
00:32:48,785 --> 00:32:51,036
I'm waiting for the bus.

641
00:32:51,103 --> 00:32:54,456
Bus isn't coming, Ina.
But this cab is going to Naples.

642
00:32:54,540 --> 00:32:55,791
Ben'll be getting
awfully hungry.

643
00:32:55,875 --> 00:32:57,492
House.

644
00:32:57,577 --> 00:33:00,128
We'll tell the cabbie
to call the cops.

645
00:33:00,213 --> 00:33:01,947
<i>They'll come pick her up,</i>
<i>take care of her.</i>

646
00:33:04,968 --> 00:33:08,754
Then I'll stay with her
until they do.

647
00:33:25,021 --> 00:33:26,738
Good-bye, Kyle.

648
00:33:34,146 --> 00:33:35,647
Bus comes
every 15 minutes.

649
00:33:35,698 --> 00:33:38,984
Oh, shut up.

650
00:33:42,121 --> 00:33:45,707
Find anything?

651
00:33:45,792 --> 00:33:47,342
Not yet.

652
00:33:47,427 --> 00:33:51,897
Running tests for MRSA.

653
00:33:51,965 --> 00:33:54,950
You've got everybody worried
about your quitting.

654
00:33:55,018 --> 00:33:57,602
You here as my boss
or my friend?

655
00:33:57,670 --> 00:34:02,507
If I was here as your boss,
you'd be suspended by now.

656
00:34:02,558 --> 00:34:05,777
I've learned a lot here.

657
00:34:05,845 --> 00:34:08,030
Enough to run
my own team.

658
00:34:08,097 --> 00:34:10,732
It's time I moved on.

659
00:34:10,817 --> 00:34:14,252
Unfortunately,
that's how I felt last year.

660
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:16,488
<i>And the year</i>
<i>before that.</i>

661
00:34:16,539 --> 00:34:20,075
Maybe there's a reason
you haven't left.

662
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:22,995
<i>You need structure.</i>

663
00:34:23,046 --> 00:34:24,429
<i>And support.</i>

664
00:34:24,497 --> 00:34:26,365
Somebody else
calling the shots.

665
00:34:33,089 --> 00:34:36,675
You didn't come down here
as my boss or my friend.

666
00:34:36,726 --> 00:34:39,761
You came down as House.

667
00:34:39,846 --> 00:34:44,683
You're trying to insult me
into making a decision.

668
00:34:44,751 --> 00:34:47,986
We've both seen it work.

669
00:34:48,054 --> 00:34:49,821
Either you rise
to the challenge

670
00:34:49,889 --> 00:34:52,324
and quit,

671
00:34:52,391 --> 00:34:54,409
or you stay.

672
00:34:54,494 --> 00:34:58,363
As a team member.

673
00:35:00,199 --> 00:35:01,399
Dr. Treiber!

674
00:35:01,451 --> 00:35:03,618
Dr. Treiber.

675
00:35:03,703 --> 00:35:07,706
He stopped responding when
I was changing his I.V. bag.

676
00:35:07,757 --> 00:35:10,425
Peter, open your eyes.

677
00:35:16,766 --> 00:35:17,599
Coma.

678
00:35:25,576 --> 00:35:27,008
Treiber's comatose.

679
00:35:27,009 --> 00:35:28,124
<i>All brains on deck.</i>

680
00:35:28,126 --> 00:35:29,923
Where should we start?
We think you might be right.

681
00:35:30,655 --> 00:35:32,740
I'm not.

682
00:35:32,736 --> 00:35:34,315
You couldn't have
gone through all of these.

683
00:35:34,404 --> 00:35:37,790
Don't have to.

684
00:35:37,874 --> 00:35:40,609
Treiber's reports
are thorough to a fault.

685
00:35:40,661 --> 00:35:42,995
His methods are fastidious.

686
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:44,297
The answer
isn't down here.

687
00:35:44,381 --> 00:35:46,499
Treiber didn't miss anything.
We did.

688
00:35:46,583 --> 00:35:47,967
<i>So what?</i>

689
00:35:48,051 --> 00:35:49,468
<i>Psychosis, abdominal pain,</i>
<i>pleural effusions,</i>

690
00:35:49,553 --> 00:35:51,220
enlarged heart, coma.

691
00:35:51,288 --> 00:35:52,255
<i>Autoimmune,</i>
<i>maybe Goodpasture's.</i>

692
00:35:52,306 --> 00:35:54,123
Kidneys are fine.
Vasculitis?

693
00:35:54,174 --> 00:35:55,308
- No fever.
<i>-  Lymphoma?</i>

694
00:35:55,392 --> 00:35:56,726
Would've seen it
on the heart biopsy.

695
00:35:56,793 --> 00:35:58,928
<i>Soap.</i>

696
00:35:58,979 --> 00:36:01,147
It's the soap.

697
00:36:18,315 --> 00:36:20,616
I blew it.

698
00:36:20,684 --> 00:36:23,586
Oh, God, here it comes.

699
00:36:23,654 --> 00:36:24,920
As always.

700
00:36:24,988 --> 00:36:26,739
All I wanted was
some meaningless fun,

701
00:36:26,807 --> 00:36:28,507
and I couldn't even
last three days.

702
00:36:28,575 --> 00:36:30,343
Sound asleep.

703
00:36:30,410 --> 00:36:32,428
I'm sleep talking.

704
00:36:32,495 --> 00:36:35,431
I had the chance to fulfill
a lifelong dream.

705
00:36:35,498 --> 00:36:37,333
I swear, I will jump
out of this moving bus

706
00:36:37,384 --> 00:36:39,302
if you don't shut up.

707
00:36:39,353 --> 00:36:42,772
But instead, I sat with a sad,
old woman for 1 1/2 hours

708
00:36:42,839 --> 00:36:45,674
who forgot I existed
three seconds after she left.

709
00:36:45,726 --> 00:36:48,728
And the stupidest thing.

710
00:36:48,812 --> 00:36:52,815
I never even had a crush
on Julie Christie.

711
00:36:55,786 --> 00:36:58,537
In 12th grade I was madly
in love with Melanie Robbins,

712
00:36:58,622 --> 00:36:59,872
who happened
to look exactly like

713
00:36:59,956 --> 00:37:01,407
Julie Christie
in <i>Dr. Zhivago.</i>

714
00:37:01,491 --> 00:37:04,827
And she really liked me.

715
00:37:04,878 --> 00:37:08,748
Played spades every lunch period
in Mr. Charlton's classroom.

716
00:37:08,832 --> 00:37:10,833
But of course,
there was this other guy.

717
00:37:10,884 --> 00:37:14,770
A great guy. Very popular.
He had a car.

718
00:37:14,838 --> 00:37:16,806
He had a band,

719
00:37:16,873 --> 00:37:19,442
<i>a mustache...</i>

720
00:37:19,509 --> 00:37:21,677
Kyle Calloway.

721
00:37:28,652 --> 00:37:30,719
I assumed that--

722
00:37:30,771 --> 00:37:34,440
I hoped that we would go
to the senior prom together,

723
00:37:34,524 --> 00:37:36,158
but she asked me
for a favor.

724
00:37:36,226 --> 00:37:38,160
She asked...

725
00:37:40,063 --> 00:37:42,698
If I minded
if she went with him.

726
00:37:42,749 --> 00:37:47,670
She asked me if I minded.

727
00:37:48,905 --> 00:37:51,807
And I said I didn't.

728
00:37:51,875 --> 00:37:54,944
<i>And that was it.</i>

729
00:37:55,011 --> 00:37:56,962
<i>And I just did it again.</i>

730
00:37:57,047 --> 00:37:57,930
<i>I let it go,</i>

731
00:37:58,014 --> 00:37:59,432
like I let everything go.

732
00:37:59,516 --> 00:38:00,966
And here I am,
sitting on this bus,

733
00:38:01,051 --> 00:38:03,018
with tickets I bought
with my watch,

734
00:38:03,086 --> 00:38:07,273
heading back home,
so a...

735
00:38:07,357 --> 00:38:12,094
a CT scan
can decide my f-fate.

736
00:38:17,367 --> 00:38:21,537
I don't wanna go back,
House.

737
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:24,874
I just--

738
00:38:24,941 --> 00:38:28,794
I just wanna
keep being Kyle.

739
00:38:34,718 --> 00:38:36,552
Kyle would've ditched

740
00:38:36,619 --> 00:38:39,889
that sad, old woman
from the bus stop.

741
00:38:39,956 --> 00:38:42,425
Probably would've
ditched me too.

742
00:38:47,647 --> 00:38:50,766
I can live without Kyle.

743
00:39:00,777 --> 00:39:02,328
Snoball?

744
00:39:12,656 --> 00:39:16,258
Guess this isn't heaven.

745
00:39:16,326 --> 00:39:18,394
<i>We found out</i>
<i>who screwed up.</i>

746
00:39:18,462 --> 00:39:19,929
You.

747
00:39:19,996 --> 00:39:23,332
<i>It was your industrial-strength</i>
<i>antibacterial soap.</i>

748
00:39:23,383 --> 00:39:26,385
The additional triclosan
does two things well:

749
00:39:26,470 --> 00:39:27,669
Kills MRSA

750
00:39:27,721 --> 00:39:30,105
and makes your thyroid
look stupid.

751
00:39:30,173 --> 00:39:31,774
<i>It thinks the triclosan</i>
<i>is a real hormone</i>

752
00:39:31,842 --> 00:39:32,691
<i>and closes up shop.</i>

753
00:39:32,776 --> 00:39:34,777
Excessive use over time

754
00:39:34,844 --> 00:39:36,946
combined with
excessive use of this

755
00:39:37,013 --> 00:39:38,981
led to hypothyroidism.

756
00:39:39,032 --> 00:39:42,368
Which went undiagnosed until it
presented with psychosis.

757
00:39:42,452 --> 00:39:43,819
When the ER put you
on the sedatives,

758
00:39:43,870 --> 00:39:48,774
it kicked you into
myxedema crisis.

759
00:39:48,842 --> 00:39:51,994
Don't know that I ever
would've thought of that.

760
00:39:52,045 --> 00:39:54,129
House told us
to look for irony.

761
00:39:56,366 --> 00:39:58,734
<i>Hey.</i>

762
00:39:58,802 --> 00:40:03,339
This wasn't House.

763
00:40:05,408 --> 00:40:08,310
[Kathleen Edwards's
<i>A Soft Place to Land]</i>

764
00:40:08,378 --> 00:40:17,603
? ?

765
00:40:17,687 --> 00:40:22,224
? you think this is easy ?

766
00:40:22,275 --> 00:40:23,559
My locker key.

767
00:40:25,895 --> 00:40:27,246
I'll give you
your own team.

768
00:40:29,165 --> 00:40:30,799
Thanks.

769
00:40:30,867 --> 00:40:33,836
But it's time
to step out of the shadow.

770
00:40:33,903 --> 00:40:37,756
? Without
any strings attached ?

771
00:40:37,841 --> 00:40:40,543
? well, I'm lookin' for ?

772
00:40:40,594 --> 00:40:44,246
? a soft place to land ?

773
00:40:44,314 --> 00:40:47,800
It's about time.

774
00:40:47,884 --> 00:40:49,635
? The palms of your hands ?

775
00:40:49,719 --> 00:40:52,588
? I'm lookin' for ?

776
00:40:52,639 --> 00:40:57,593
? a soft place to land ?

777
00:40:57,644 --> 00:41:05,601
? ?

778
00:41:05,669 --> 00:41:09,438
? I call it an ace ?

779
00:41:09,506 --> 00:41:12,441
? you've gotta believe me ?

780
00:41:12,509 --> 00:41:14,410
? but you're
calling me names ?

781
00:41:14,461 --> 00:41:17,496
? and not to my face ?

782
00:41:17,581 --> 00:41:19,415
Any news?

783
00:41:19,466 --> 00:41:22,718
Not yet.

784
00:41:22,785 --> 00:41:27,456
You come here so I could
talk you out of it?

785
00:41:27,524 --> 00:41:29,592
I came to say thank you.

786
00:41:29,643 --> 00:41:32,761
? I'm lookin' for ?

787
00:41:32,812 --> 00:41:35,764
? a soft place to land ?

788
00:41:35,815 --> 00:41:37,633
? the forest floor ?

789
00:41:37,684 --> 00:41:39,602
? the palms of your hands ?

790
00:41:39,653 --> 00:41:40,936
It's been fun.

791
00:41:41,004 --> 00:41:42,271
? I'm lookin' for ?

792
00:41:42,339 --> 00:41:43,572
Fun?

793
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:44,740
? A soft place to land ?

794
00:41:44,807 --> 00:41:47,309
Sounded pithier than...

795
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:51,413
"We've shared
a variety of situations."

796
00:41:53,633 --> 00:41:57,419
Let me know
about Wilson.

797
00:42:10,266 --> 00:42:13,686
<i>Why did you</i>
<i>let him go?</i>

798
00:42:13,770 --> 00:42:17,640
Legal loophole.
13th Amendment.

799
00:42:17,691 --> 00:42:19,558
Abraham Lincoln may have
looked great in that hat,

800
00:42:19,643 --> 00:42:24,480
but his labor policies...

801
00:42:32,922 --> 00:42:34,590
House.
