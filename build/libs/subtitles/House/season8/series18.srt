1
00:00:40,403 --> 00:00:43,405
Who are you?

2
00:00:43,456 --> 00:00:45,490
What are you doing?
Get out of here!

3
00:00:45,574 --> 00:00:47,826
Mom!

4
00:00:51,547 --> 00:00:53,114
<i>Lue? Lue?</i>

5
00:00:53,182 --> 00:00:54,716
You okay?

6
00:00:57,453 --> 00:00:59,471
Okay, honey.

7
00:00:59,555 --> 00:01:00,972
Calm down.
It's all right.

8
00:01:01,057 --> 00:01:02,557
You're just having
another bad dream.

9
00:01:02,624 --> 00:01:04,125
I can't breathe!

10
00:01:04,176 --> 00:01:05,560
Yes, you can.

11
00:01:05,627 --> 00:01:07,595
You're fine.
Just relax.

12
00:01:07,646 --> 00:01:10,348
Just take slow,
deep breaths.

13
00:01:10,433 --> 00:01:11,516
Nice and easy.

14
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:13,318
There's nothing
to be afraid of.

15
00:01:13,402 --> 00:01:17,772
I'm...trying...
But I can't!

16
00:01:17,823 --> 00:01:18,823
Relax.

17
00:01:18,908 --> 00:01:20,742
Slow, deep breaths.

18
00:01:20,809 --> 00:01:24,645
I...can't.

19
00:01:26,415 --> 00:01:29,117
Lue?

20
00:01:29,168 --> 00:01:31,669
Oh, my God.
Lue?

21
00:01:31,754 --> 00:01:33,171
Lue, wake up!

22
00:01:33,255 --> 00:01:34,989
Wake up, Lue!
Come on!

23
00:01:35,041 --> 00:01:36,791
Lue!

[Massive Attack's <i>Teardrop]</i>

26
00:01:46,077 --> 00:02:08,052
?

27
00:02:10,826 --> 00:02:12,494
Been paging you
for over two hours.

28
00:02:12,545 --> 00:02:14,996
I must've been
in the shower.

29
00:02:15,047 --> 00:02:16,164
Then I had to
moisturize.

30
00:02:16,215 --> 00:02:17,882
Eight-year-old boy
was brought into the ER

31
00:02:17,967 --> 00:02:20,502
last night with
acute respiratory distress.

32
00:02:20,553 --> 00:02:25,590
No history of--

33
00:02:25,674 --> 00:02:28,476
no histories
of asthma or allergies,

34
00:02:28,544 --> 00:02:30,395
and his chest
X-ray's clear.

35
00:02:30,479 --> 00:02:32,847
Actually, I had
to moisturize twice.

36
00:02:32,898 --> 00:02:35,850
Dominika made oysters
Rockefeller last night.

37
00:02:35,901 --> 00:02:37,318
Kid's been having
night terrors.

38
00:02:37,386 --> 00:02:39,887
Woke up in the middle of one
in full respiratory arrest.

39
00:02:39,912 --> 00:02:41,912
Stress induced panic attack.

40
00:02:42,158 --> 00:02:44,275
Tell the parents
to lay off the grades.

41
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:45,910
The world
needs fry cooks too.

42
00:02:45,995 --> 00:02:47,412
Does great in school.

43
00:02:47,496 --> 00:02:49,247
The parents are divorced,
but it was amicable.

44
00:02:49,331 --> 00:02:50,731
And the dad's
moved out of state.

45
00:02:50,783 --> 00:02:54,335
Have you seen
Wilson around?

46
00:02:54,403 --> 00:02:57,005
The dreams are about
an ugly, old hag

47
00:02:57,072 --> 00:03:00,925
trying to strangle him.

48
00:03:02,261 --> 00:03:06,514
The family's Hmong.

49
00:03:09,185 --> 00:03:11,519
SUNDS--

50
00:03:11,587 --> 00:03:15,723
sudden unexpected
nocturnal death syndrome,

51
00:03:15,774 --> 00:03:21,729
aka BS name for no one's
figured out why they died.

52
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:23,931
Over 100
in the early '80s.

53
00:03:23,983 --> 00:03:27,235
Only male.
Only Hmong.

54
00:03:27,286 --> 00:03:30,622
Healthy right up
until the moment

55
00:03:30,706 --> 00:03:33,107
they died in their sleep.

56
00:03:33,159 --> 00:03:35,043
What was he dreaming about?
It doesn't matter.

57
00:03:35,110 --> 00:03:36,161
<i>It's a dream.</i>

58
00:03:36,245 --> 00:03:37,879
It doesn't
mean anything.

59
00:03:37,946 --> 00:03:39,280
If the nightmare's
scary enough,

60
00:03:39,331 --> 00:03:41,549
meaningful or not, it could
cause a catecholamine surge

61
00:03:41,617 --> 00:03:43,051
and ventricular
fibrillation.

62
00:03:43,118 --> 00:03:45,503
An ancient demon
called a Dab

63
00:03:45,588 --> 00:03:46,921
was sitting on him,
strangling him.

64
00:03:46,972 --> 00:03:48,423
I think that qualifies.

65
00:03:48,474 --> 00:03:49,757
Except in the rational
part of the file,

66
00:03:49,808 --> 00:03:52,260
where it says his EKG's
within normal limits.

67
00:03:52,328 --> 00:03:53,761
<i>It's not his heart.</i>

68
00:03:53,812 --> 00:03:55,129
What about obstructive
sleep apnea?

69
00:03:55,181 --> 00:03:56,898
Sleep apnea wouldn't
have caused breathing problems

70
00:03:56,965 --> 00:03:57,849
after he woke up.

71
00:03:57,933 --> 00:03:59,567
What did you dream of?

72
00:03:59,635 --> 00:04:01,819
I never remember
my dreams.

73
00:04:01,904 --> 00:04:04,489
But you're certain
that they're insignificant.

74
00:04:04,573 --> 00:04:05,940
Defensively so.

75
00:04:05,991 --> 00:04:07,475
I was defending science.

76
00:04:07,526 --> 00:04:09,477
You were defensively
defending science.

77
00:04:09,528 --> 00:04:11,029
Lung damage
from inhaled toxins

78
00:04:11,113 --> 00:04:12,947
could keep causing problems
after he woke up.

79
00:04:12,998 --> 00:04:14,966
Or an upper respiratory
infection.

80
00:04:15,034 --> 00:04:17,418
Okay, Chase and Park,

81
00:04:17,486 --> 00:04:19,654
start iv antibiotics
for pneumonia.

82
00:04:19,705 --> 00:04:21,339
Taub and Adams,
go check the home for toxins.

83
00:04:21,423 --> 00:04:23,675
Could I go with Taub?

84
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:25,593
It was my idea.

85
00:04:25,661 --> 00:04:28,429
Right...
'cause for a moment there,

86
00:04:28,497 --> 00:04:30,098
I thought you were
uncomfortable around Chase

87
00:04:30,165 --> 00:04:33,218
because you'd had
a nocturnal Australian.

88
00:04:36,522 --> 00:04:38,389
You can go with
whoever you want.

89
00:04:38,474 --> 00:04:41,809
But all of you,
read all of these files.

90
00:04:50,319 --> 00:04:52,954
Do you believe a spirit
could be hurting your son?

91
00:04:53,021 --> 00:04:54,622
No, of course not.

92
00:04:54,690 --> 00:04:56,708
Because if he's been taught
to believe that,

93
00:04:56,792 --> 00:04:58,393
it is possible
for the fear alone

94
00:04:58,460 --> 00:04:59,494
to affect heart function.

95
00:04:59,545 --> 00:05:00,962
I'm an engineer.

96
00:05:01,029 --> 00:05:03,631
I know illnesses aren't
caused by evil spirits.

97
00:05:03,699 --> 00:05:05,049
I'm sorry,
I didn't mean to,

98
00:05:05,134 --> 00:05:07,468
I just...
had to check.

99
00:05:07,536 --> 00:05:09,887
Anything else
you need to check?

100
00:05:09,972 --> 00:05:12,840
No.

101
00:05:22,184 --> 00:05:23,768
I had a dream.

102
00:05:23,852 --> 00:05:25,270
House...

103
00:05:25,354 --> 00:05:27,739
We can talk later.

104
00:05:27,823 --> 00:05:29,941
Relax, I'm a Doctor.

105
00:05:30,025 --> 00:05:32,226
Your spectacular breasts
mean nothing to me.

106
00:05:32,278 --> 00:05:33,361
House...

107
00:05:33,412 --> 00:05:35,913
House!

108
00:05:41,403 --> 00:05:43,237
Later.

109
00:05:43,289 --> 00:05:44,756
I had sex with Dominika.

110
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:46,674
In a dream?

111
00:05:46,742 --> 00:05:49,427
It wasn't literally sex.

112
00:05:49,511 --> 00:05:51,746
Technically,
it was flossing.

113
00:05:51,797 --> 00:05:53,464
You know,
teeth, testicles.

114
00:05:53,549 --> 00:05:55,683
I think the symbolism
is pretty clear.

115
00:05:55,751 --> 00:05:59,187
"Later" just changed
to "never."

116
00:06:04,276 --> 00:06:06,060
I'll tell you
what would be weirder,

117
00:06:06,111 --> 00:06:08,696
if you <i>didn't</i> dream about
having sex with Chase.

118
00:06:08,764 --> 00:06:10,031
Have you?

119
00:06:10,098 --> 00:06:11,866
No.

120
00:06:11,933 --> 00:06:13,318
But I've dreamed
about having sex

121
00:06:13,402 --> 00:06:14,736
with a lot of people
I work with,

122
00:06:14,787 --> 00:06:15,936
and it didn't
freak me out.

123
00:06:15,988 --> 00:06:17,438
That's different.

124
00:06:17,489 --> 00:06:18,773
How?

125
00:06:18,824 --> 00:06:20,375
'Cause you've
actually had sex

126
00:06:20,442 --> 00:06:21,459
with a lot of people
at work,

127
00:06:21,543 --> 00:06:23,944
and that hasn't
freaked you out.

128
00:06:23,996 --> 00:06:25,630
Good point.

129
00:06:25,714 --> 00:06:29,116
So you're worried
about what it means?

130
00:06:29,168 --> 00:06:32,253
I'm not worried.
It means nothing.

131
00:06:32,304 --> 00:06:35,807
It means something,
doesn't it?

132
00:06:35,891 --> 00:06:37,225
I work with him.

133
00:06:37,292 --> 00:06:39,727
I can't want
to sleep with him.

134
00:06:39,795 --> 00:06:41,629
Maybe Chase
just represents work.

135
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:45,233
You're just falling in love
with your job.

136
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:47,635
It has been
very satisfying lately.

137
00:06:47,686 --> 00:06:49,370
You smell that?

138
00:06:49,438 --> 00:06:52,740
Yeah.
Smells like wet dog.

139
00:06:54,827 --> 00:06:56,027
It's mold.

140
00:06:56,111 --> 00:06:58,863
It's not mold.
It's definitely mold.

141
00:07:12,261 --> 00:07:17,048
I don't see
any sign of water damage.

142
00:07:25,858 --> 00:07:29,560
<i>Holy crap.</i>

143
00:07:36,108 --> 00:07:37,575
It looked like
a slaughterhouse.

144
00:07:37,643 --> 00:07:39,590
I don't know what
you're talking about.

145
00:07:39,594 --> 00:07:41,045
It was clean
when we left.

146
00:07:41,096 --> 00:07:43,047
You're telling us
some random person

147
00:07:43,098 --> 00:07:45,299
broke into your house
to dismember a pig

148
00:07:45,383 --> 00:07:46,600
in your son's bedroom?

149
00:07:46,685 --> 00:07:48,352
A pig?

150
00:07:48,419 --> 00:07:51,254
My father-in-law.

151
00:07:53,925 --> 00:07:57,027
What did you do?

152
00:07:57,095 --> 00:07:58,712
What you should have
done weeks ago,

153
00:07:58,780 --> 00:07:59,897
<i>when the dreams started.</i>

154
00:07:59,948 --> 00:08:01,315
I'm saving Lue.

155
00:08:01,399 --> 00:08:02,449
<i>He's coding!</i>

156
00:08:02,534 --> 00:08:06,620
<i>Need a Doctor in here!</i>

157
00:08:06,705 --> 00:08:08,706
V-tach.
No pulse.

158
00:08:08,773 --> 00:08:10,541
Oh, my God!
Push 1 milligram EPI!

159
00:08:10,608 --> 00:08:13,460
Paddles. Charge to 50.
Charging!

160
00:08:13,545 --> 00:08:15,496
Clear!

161
00:08:17,048 --> 00:08:18,115
Baby...

162
00:08:18,166 --> 00:08:19,116
Still V-tach!

163
00:08:19,167 --> 00:08:21,335
Charge to 100!

164
00:08:21,419 --> 00:08:22,386
100!

165
00:08:22,453 --> 00:08:25,089
Clear!

166
00:08:25,140 --> 00:08:26,140
Charge--
wait!

167
00:08:26,224 --> 00:08:27,224
Normal sinus rhythm.

168
00:08:33,815 --> 00:08:35,683
Oh, God!

169
00:08:35,767 --> 00:08:37,067
He's stable,

170
00:08:37,135 --> 00:08:38,769
but we've obviously
got a second symptom.

171
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:40,237
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
kid in V-tach.

172
00:08:40,304 --> 00:08:41,905
Tell me about the luau
in his bedroom.

173
00:08:41,973 --> 00:08:43,574
It's a traditional
Hmong ceremony

174
00:08:43,641 --> 00:08:45,409
that's supposed to call back
the kid's soul.

175
00:08:45,477 --> 00:08:47,645
Hasn't he heard of star-69?
<i>There's more.</i>

176
00:08:47,712 --> 00:08:49,546
The reason grandpa thinks
the kid's soul is stolen

177
00:08:49,614 --> 00:08:51,915
is because he's convinced
his son, the kid's father,

178
00:08:51,983 --> 00:08:53,083
<i>had his stolen as well.</i>

179
00:08:53,151 --> 00:08:55,586
He beat his boss
to death.

180
00:08:55,654 --> 00:08:56,503
The dad
didn't move away.

181
00:08:56,571 --> 00:08:57,988
He's in prison.

182
00:08:58,039 --> 00:09:00,657
PTSD could definitely
cause breathing problems--

183
00:09:00,709 --> 00:09:01,959
It's not PTSD.

184
00:09:02,010 --> 00:09:04,294
Even if the kid
wasn't there,

185
00:09:04,346 --> 00:09:05,679
just hearing
what the dad did--

186
00:09:05,764 --> 00:09:06,714
But he hasn't.

187
00:09:06,798 --> 00:09:08,215
It happened
when he was two,

188
00:09:08,299 --> 00:09:09,550
and all he's ever
been told is that

189
00:09:09,634 --> 00:09:10,884
his parents divorced

190
00:09:10,969 --> 00:09:12,720
and his dad moved away.

191
00:09:12,804 --> 00:09:14,355
The heart thing indicates
a malignant arrhythmia.

192
00:09:14,439 --> 00:09:15,556
<i>He needs an E.P. study.</i>

193
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:16,674
How many
of the other files

194
00:09:16,741 --> 00:09:18,342
showed malignant
arrhythmias?

195
00:09:18,410 --> 00:09:19,393
None, but--

196
00:09:19,477 --> 00:09:20,510
Forget the E.P.

197
00:09:20,562 --> 00:09:21,845
What about
acute pericarditis?

198
00:09:21,913 --> 00:09:23,113
<i>Explains the dyspnea.</i>

199
00:09:23,181 --> 00:09:24,231
How many
of the other files--

200
00:09:24,315 --> 00:09:25,983
<i>it's exacerbated</i>
<i>by lying supine,</i>

201
00:09:26,034 --> 00:09:27,451
so the symptoms
would get worse

202
00:09:27,518 --> 00:09:28,619
when he goes to sleep.

203
00:09:28,686 --> 00:09:32,406
Just like all 100
of the others.

204
00:09:32,490 --> 00:09:35,159
Do an echo to check
the pericardium.

205
00:09:35,226 --> 00:09:37,211
See if you can find
any cardioactive toxins

206
00:09:37,295 --> 00:09:40,080
in the home samples.

207
00:09:40,165 --> 00:09:45,235
Can I just say that I
very much enjoy my job?

208
00:09:52,577 --> 00:09:53,727
<i>No, no, please.</i>

209
00:09:53,812 --> 00:09:57,931
No need to apologize
for your earlier behavior.

210
00:09:58,016 --> 00:09:59,867
<i>Floss was mint</i>

211
00:09:59,934 --> 00:10:02,269
probably because of
this green G-string

212
00:10:02,353 --> 00:10:04,154
she hangs up to dry
in the bathroom.

213
00:10:04,222 --> 00:10:05,989
My watch
must have stopped.

214
00:10:06,057 --> 00:10:08,025
Apparently
it's already "never."

215
00:10:08,076 --> 00:10:09,076
You might want to
forward your calls.

216
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:10,411
You do not want

217
00:10:10,495 --> 00:10:11,862
the <i>Reader's Digest</i>
version on this.

218
00:10:11,930 --> 00:10:15,282
There was a very tight
hygienist's uniform,

219
00:10:15,366 --> 00:10:18,035
suggestive use
of the water sprayer--

220
00:10:18,103 --> 00:10:19,870
The floss isn't sex.
It's guilt.

221
00:10:19,921 --> 00:10:21,755
<i>It's tying you up</i>
<i>for throwing away</i>

222
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:23,073
<i>the I.N.S. notification</i>

223
00:10:23,124 --> 00:10:25,843
granting Dominika
her citizenship.

224
00:10:25,910 --> 00:10:28,629
She can move out,
but she still doesn't know it,

225
00:10:28,713 --> 00:10:31,432
which means you're basically
holding her prisoner.

226
00:10:31,516 --> 00:10:32,916
<i>Tell her the truth,</i>

227
00:10:32,967 --> 00:10:36,086
and leave me alone.

228
00:10:48,817 --> 00:10:50,267
Really?
What?

229
00:10:50,335 --> 00:10:53,153
You startled me.

230
00:10:54,622 --> 00:10:55,772
We work together
every day,

231
00:10:55,824 --> 00:10:57,658
usually under
a fair amount of stress.

232
00:10:57,742 --> 00:10:58,992
It's only natural
I'd pop into

233
00:10:59,077 --> 00:11:03,614
a subconscious thought
every once in a while.

234
00:11:03,681 --> 00:11:05,999
Have you ever dreamt
about having sex with me?

235
00:11:06,084 --> 00:11:07,801
No.

236
00:11:07,886 --> 00:11:09,086
You paused.

237
00:11:09,137 --> 00:11:12,422
No, I didn't.
You think I'm lying?

238
00:11:12,474 --> 00:11:14,341
No, I think you're
fighting the urge

239
00:11:14,425 --> 00:11:16,560
to snap the word "no"
because your subconscious

240
00:11:16,627 --> 00:11:19,630
finds the idea abhorrent.

241
00:11:23,768 --> 00:11:24,985
So if I snap,
it's offensive,

242
00:11:25,069 --> 00:11:26,469
and if I don't snap,
it's offensive

243
00:11:26,521 --> 00:11:27,604
for the exact
same reason?

244
00:11:27,655 --> 00:11:29,806
Talk to your
subconscious.

245
00:11:29,858 --> 00:11:31,992
This is becoming weird
because you're making it weird.

246
00:11:32,076 --> 00:11:34,578
So you don't find
the idea abhorrent?

247
00:11:34,645 --> 00:11:35,746
I work with you.

248
00:11:35,813 --> 00:11:36,830
I don't have to answer
that question.

249
00:11:36,915 --> 00:11:40,918
You just did.

250
00:11:40,985 --> 00:11:42,920
What happened?

251
00:11:44,756 --> 00:11:46,623
Echo was negative,

252
00:11:46,674 --> 00:11:48,625
but he has severe
abdominal pain.

253
00:11:48,676 --> 00:11:51,161
Ultrasound didn't suggest
any intestinal blockages,

254
00:11:51,212 --> 00:11:53,847
but he's severely
constipated.

255
00:11:53,932 --> 00:11:55,332
No spores, clostridium,
or organic toxins

256
00:11:55,383 --> 00:11:57,601
in the kitchen samples.
Nothing in the bedroom either.

257
00:11:57,668 --> 00:11:59,102
We need to scope him,
and we're gonna need

258
00:11:59,170 --> 00:12:00,270
to clear his bowel first.

259
00:12:00,338 --> 00:12:01,838
We should biopsy
his thyroid.

260
00:12:01,890 --> 00:12:03,690
For an impacted bowel?

261
00:12:03,775 --> 00:12:05,642
Hashimoto's thyroiditis
would explain

262
00:12:05,693 --> 00:12:07,844
his lung, heart,
and intestinal involvement.

263
00:12:07,896 --> 00:12:10,147
And if you think we still
need house's approval,

264
00:12:10,198 --> 00:12:14,201
it also explains
dying in your sleep.

265
00:12:17,622 --> 00:12:20,457
Nice call.

266
00:12:24,028 --> 00:12:25,212
When you invite me
for dinner,

267
00:12:25,296 --> 00:12:26,696
I thought maybe you
take me to a restaurant.

268
00:12:26,748 --> 00:12:28,632
Or have plates.

269
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:30,918
Yeah, sorry.

270
00:12:31,002 --> 00:12:32,386
Idiot delivery guy
forgot them.

271
00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:34,137
Mm...the idiot
delivery guy,

272
00:12:34,205 --> 00:12:35,372
or the idiot guy
whose food you stole

273
00:12:35,423 --> 00:12:38,342
from lounge
refrigerator, huh?

274
00:12:38,393 --> 00:12:40,143
You've gotten to know me
pretty well.

275
00:12:40,211 --> 00:12:44,381
My citizenship
depends on it, right?

276
00:12:44,432 --> 00:12:46,600
Yeah...

277
00:12:46,684 --> 00:12:48,352
that's actually why
I wanted to talk to you.

278
00:12:48,403 --> 00:12:49,353
You heard news?

279
00:12:49,404 --> 00:12:52,940
Yeah.

280
00:12:53,024 --> 00:12:54,524
So what news?

281
00:12:54,576 --> 00:12:58,862
They want us to come in
for another interview?

282
00:12:58,913 --> 00:13:01,932
No.

283
00:13:04,919 --> 00:13:05,953
Since we hadn't
heard anything,

284
00:13:06,037 --> 00:13:09,673
I--I called,
and they said

285
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:12,042
it's gonna be
a couple weeks,

286
00:13:12,093 --> 00:13:14,278
maybe a month
till they finalize

287
00:13:14,345 --> 00:13:16,096
their decision.

288
00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:17,130
A month?

289
00:13:17,215 --> 00:13:21,268
Yeah, I know.
It sucks.

290
00:13:21,352 --> 00:13:25,806
No, it's--it's not suck
to live with you.

291
00:13:25,890 --> 00:13:27,774
It's been fun, but...

292
00:13:27,859 --> 00:13:31,928
you know, I just
want to be legal.

293
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:33,596
And you will be.

294
00:13:33,648 --> 00:13:37,401
Absolutely.

295
00:13:37,452 --> 00:13:39,319
In the meantime...
Hmm?

296
00:13:39,404 --> 00:13:42,272
You ever shot anyone?

297
00:13:46,494 --> 00:13:47,628
No, get away.

298
00:13:47,712 --> 00:13:49,162
Look, this needle

299
00:13:49,247 --> 00:13:50,881
isn't nearly as big
as the one in your arm,

300
00:13:50,948 --> 00:13:52,215
and that didn't hurt,
did it?

301
00:13:52,283 --> 00:13:53,317
I don't want it.

302
00:13:53,384 --> 00:13:54,284
They need
to do it, Lue.

303
00:13:54,335 --> 00:13:55,919
You'll only feel

304
00:13:55,970 --> 00:13:57,170
a little pinch
as we give you

305
00:13:57,255 --> 00:13:58,305
the numbing medicine,
and after that,

306
00:13:58,389 --> 00:13:59,473
you won't feel a thing.

307
00:13:59,557 --> 00:14:01,508
No!

308
00:14:01,592 --> 00:14:02,759
Lue, calm down.
It's gonna be okay.

309
00:14:07,148 --> 00:14:08,348
What's he saying?

310
00:14:08,433 --> 00:14:10,434
What's the problem?
I don't know.

311
00:14:10,485 --> 00:14:12,185
He's saying
it's too late.

312
00:14:12,270 --> 00:14:14,404
There's nothing
we can do.

313
00:14:14,472 --> 00:14:15,605
It's Hmong.

314
00:14:15,657 --> 00:14:17,524
He doesn't speak Hmong.

315
00:14:17,608 --> 00:14:18,975
<i>He's never even</i>
<i>heard it.</i>

316
00:14:19,027 --> 00:14:20,110
<i>It isn't him speaking.</i>

317
00:14:20,161 --> 00:14:22,145
It's the Dab.

318
00:14:22,196 --> 00:14:23,613
He's seizing!

319
00:14:23,665 --> 00:14:25,032
Oh--!
Oh, my God!

320
00:14:25,116 --> 00:14:27,668
Need some
Lorazepam in here!

321
00:14:35,737 --> 00:14:37,698
Seizure
rules out Hashimoto's.

322
00:14:37,699 --> 00:14:38,750
Yeah,
that's the issue,

323
00:14:38,834 --> 00:14:40,752
not that we have
no rational explanation

324
00:14:40,836 --> 00:14:42,103
<i>for how the patient</i>
<i>spoke a language</i>

325
00:14:42,171 --> 00:14:43,004
<i>he's never even heard.</i>

326
00:14:43,055 --> 00:14:44,005
I've got one.

327
00:14:47,009 --> 00:14:51,563
It means "you're a bunch
of pathetic idiots" in Hmong.

328
00:14:51,647 --> 00:14:53,214
Or it doesn't.

329
00:14:53,265 --> 00:14:56,017
But you wouldn't know because
none of you speak Hmong.

330
00:14:56,068 --> 00:14:57,218
Kid, on the other hand,

331
00:14:57,269 --> 00:14:59,070
is presumably fluent
in gibberish.

332
00:14:59,154 --> 00:15:00,488
The grandfather
speaks Hmong.

333
00:15:00,556 --> 00:15:01,689
He translated.

334
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:03,208
He heard what
he wanted to hear,

335
00:15:03,275 --> 00:15:05,109
'cause if his grandson
really is possessed,

336
00:15:05,194 --> 00:15:06,727
that means his son
really is possessed,

337
00:15:06,779 --> 00:15:08,363
which is a giant step up
from being

338
00:15:08,414 --> 00:15:10,114
a sledgehammering
psychopath.

339
00:15:10,199 --> 00:15:11,766
Whatever it was
preceded a seizure.

340
00:15:11,834 --> 00:15:13,117
It's obviously
a neurological symptom.

341
00:15:13,185 --> 00:15:14,836
Scleroderma,
advanced to the point

342
00:15:14,904 --> 00:15:17,738
that it's affecting
his brain?

343
00:15:17,790 --> 00:15:18,756
Interesting.

344
00:15:18,841 --> 00:15:19,874
So we should
start treating--

345
00:15:19,942 --> 00:15:21,125
Interesting
that you keep

346
00:15:21,210 --> 00:15:23,878
falling for it
when I say "interesting."

347
00:15:23,929 --> 00:15:24,929
The scleroderma part
was idiotic--

348
00:15:25,014 --> 00:15:26,264
we'd have seen
skin involvement.

349
00:15:26,348 --> 00:15:28,683
The interesting part is
that you and Park agree,

350
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:31,519
but you're not able
to look at each other.

351
00:15:33,105 --> 00:15:35,940
Um...
I'm looking at her.

352
00:15:36,025 --> 00:15:37,559
I'm looking at him.

353
00:15:37,626 --> 00:15:41,929
Good,
now lick your lips.

354
00:15:41,981 --> 00:15:44,249
Rasmussen's encephalitis.

355
00:15:44,316 --> 00:15:45,483
Diffuse spotty
inflammation

356
00:15:45,568 --> 00:15:47,068
could hit the autonomic
centers of the brain.

357
00:15:51,407 --> 00:15:56,127
It's Hmong for
"get an MRI to confirm."

358
00:16:01,083 --> 00:16:03,084
Rasmussen's encephalitis.

359
00:16:03,135 --> 00:16:04,802
But he'll be okay?

360
00:16:04,887 --> 00:16:07,472
With treatment,
it's manageable.

361
00:16:07,556 --> 00:16:10,124
And it explains
all the things

362
00:16:10,175 --> 00:16:10,975
that have
happened to him?

363
00:16:11,060 --> 00:16:12,627
We think so.

364
00:16:12,678 --> 00:16:13,845
You are wrong.

365
00:16:13,929 --> 00:16:15,980
And you are wasting
my grandson's time.

366
00:16:16,065 --> 00:16:17,815
Neurological issues
can cause a person

367
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:20,018
to speak in tongues,
speak with an accent--

368
00:16:20,102 --> 00:16:21,653
He wasn't
speaking in tongues!

369
00:16:21,737 --> 00:16:22,987
In times of stress,

370
00:16:23,072 --> 00:16:24,939
our senses can fool us
into believing--

371
00:16:24,990 --> 00:16:27,942
I know the difference
between science and faith,

372
00:16:27,993 --> 00:16:30,144
and when my son started
having the same dreams

373
00:16:30,195 --> 00:16:34,365
my grandson is having,
science couldn't help him.

374
00:16:34,450 --> 00:16:36,951
I'm sorry if your son
suffered from mental illness.

375
00:16:37,002 --> 00:16:40,588
Kao was not crazy.

376
00:16:40,656 --> 00:16:43,875
He was bright,
caring, happy,

377
00:16:43,959 --> 00:16:46,127
until the bad dreams came.

378
00:16:46,178 --> 00:16:49,764
I don't want to watch it
happen again.

379
00:16:51,467 --> 00:16:53,851
Please don't
scare the boy.

380
00:16:53,936 --> 00:16:57,722
It won't help him
get better.

381
00:17:08,067 --> 00:17:11,519
<i>Axial view of mid-brain</i>
<i>level looks good.</i>

382
00:17:11,570 --> 00:17:14,088
Moving on to thalamic.

383
00:17:14,156 --> 00:17:16,424
I had another dream
last night.

384
00:17:16,492 --> 00:17:18,543
This time
it was about you.

385
00:17:18,627 --> 00:17:20,294
Really?

386
00:17:20,362 --> 00:17:22,463
See, that's how
you're supposed to react.

387
00:17:22,531 --> 00:17:24,382
When a woman tells you
she's dreamt about you,

388
00:17:24,466 --> 00:17:26,718
you should be thrilled,

389
00:17:26,802 --> 00:17:28,753
even if you're not interested
in her whatsoever.

390
00:17:28,821 --> 00:17:30,154
You're an idiot,
you know that?

391
00:17:30,222 --> 00:17:32,173
Well, I definitely won't be
dreaming about you tonight.

392
00:17:32,224 --> 00:17:33,441
I'm jealous
of you two.

393
00:17:33,509 --> 00:17:35,076
<i>You couldn't be</i>
<i>more different,</i>

394
00:17:35,144 --> 00:17:36,561
<i>and yet you have</i>
<i>this good thing happening.</i>

395
00:17:36,645 --> 00:17:40,014
You support each other.
You like each other.

396
00:17:40,082 --> 00:17:42,850
Don't let House
screw it up.

397
00:17:44,403 --> 00:17:45,386
We're not
<i>that</i> different.

398
00:17:45,454 --> 00:17:48,589
Yeah, you are.

399
00:18:07,376 --> 00:18:09,427
Apparently, there are
some things about you

400
00:18:09,511 --> 00:18:10,461
I don't know.

401
00:18:10,546 --> 00:18:12,847
I served one year
in police unit.

402
00:18:12,914 --> 00:18:15,516
And you're just telling
your husband now?

403
00:18:15,584 --> 00:18:17,101
Immigration
doesn't know.

404
00:18:17,186 --> 00:18:18,553
No need
for husband to know.

405
00:18:21,690 --> 00:18:23,691
What is happening
to boy with demons?

406
00:18:23,759 --> 00:18:26,894
Absence of evidence
on an MRI,

407
00:18:26,945 --> 00:18:30,982
which my team has mistaken
for evidence of absence.

408
00:18:33,952 --> 00:18:36,788
This is what
I am not understanding:

409
00:18:36,872 --> 00:18:38,489
How can you believe
in dark matters

410
00:18:38,574 --> 00:18:40,208
but not in
dark spirits?

411
00:18:40,275 --> 00:18:43,161
Is--is the idea
of demons

412
00:18:43,245 --> 00:18:45,379
so different than
the higgs boson?

413
00:18:45,447 --> 00:18:46,798
We can't see it,
but we can see

414
00:18:46,882 --> 00:18:50,718
the impact
of its presence.

415
00:18:50,786 --> 00:18:53,654
I borrowed
your physics book.

416
00:18:53,722 --> 00:18:56,791
I read while in bathroom.

417
00:18:56,842 --> 00:18:58,059
You're a dead-eye shot

418
00:18:58,126 --> 00:18:59,627
and enjoy reading
quantum physics

419
00:18:59,678 --> 00:19:00,728
on the crapper?

420
00:19:00,796 --> 00:19:02,764
I read in bathtub.

421
00:19:02,815 --> 00:19:05,466
Better image.

422
00:19:05,517 --> 00:19:08,402
Thank you.

423
00:19:15,977 --> 00:19:19,363
The doctors say
my brain is sick.

424
00:19:19,448 --> 00:19:21,315
Your doctors
are trying their best,

425
00:19:21,366 --> 00:19:23,651
but they're not looking
in the right place.

426
00:19:23,702 --> 00:19:26,521
You know, I know
this is a lot

427
00:19:26,588 --> 00:19:28,656
to put on
an eight-year-old,

428
00:19:28,707 --> 00:19:30,558
but you have angered
our ancestors

429
00:19:30,626 --> 00:19:32,593
by ignoring them.

430
00:19:32,661 --> 00:19:36,380
Now do you remember
how to talk to them?

431
00:19:37,516 --> 00:19:39,500
Yeah, that's right.

432
00:19:39,551 --> 00:19:40,501
Good.

433
00:19:40,552 --> 00:19:42,386
Now close your eyes,

434
00:19:42,471 --> 00:19:47,241
and we will ask
for forgiveness together.

435
00:19:48,877 --> 00:19:52,680
You're doing good...

436
00:19:52,748 --> 00:19:55,716
But we have to do more.

437
00:19:55,784 --> 00:19:57,852
The evil spirits
are in the air,

438
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:59,654
and the only way
to stop them

439
00:19:59,721 --> 00:20:04,592
is by stopping the air.

440
00:20:18,390 --> 00:20:22,343
You have to be brave.
I'm not trying to hurt you.

441
00:20:22,394 --> 00:20:25,813
This will help you.

442
00:20:25,881 --> 00:20:29,734
I know it will.

443
00:20:34,222 --> 00:20:35,523
<i>Lue?</i>

444
00:20:35,574 --> 00:20:37,024
You okay?

445
00:20:37,075 --> 00:20:38,576
I can't wake him up!

446
00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:39,560
Lue!

447
00:20:39,611 --> 00:20:41,529
Lue, you're safe.

448
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:42,864
You're in the hospital.

449
00:20:42,915 --> 00:20:44,949
Get grandpa away!

450
00:20:45,033 --> 00:20:47,084
He's not here, honey.
It was just a dream.

451
00:20:47,169 --> 00:20:48,586
He was choking me!

452
00:20:48,670 --> 00:20:50,087
No, Lue,
it wasn't real.

453
00:20:50,172 --> 00:20:53,090
It was!
He grabbed my neck!

454
00:20:56,745 --> 00:21:00,548
Those bruises
weren't there before.

455
00:21:04,284 --> 00:21:06,418
He had the dream,
and then he had the bruising.

456
00:21:07,969 --> 00:21:09,620
<i>More likely--</i>

457
00:21:09,671 --> 00:21:11,672
and by "likely,"
I mean "rationally"--

458
00:21:11,757 --> 00:21:13,090
it's the other
way around.

459
00:21:13,141 --> 00:21:14,892
His brain felt
the pain in his neck

460
00:21:14,959 --> 00:21:18,012
and created the dream
to explain it.

461
00:21:18,096 --> 00:21:19,230
Coagulopathy.

462
00:21:19,297 --> 00:21:21,682
Lung problems cause
a clotting disturbance.

463
00:21:21,767 --> 00:21:23,184
He would have
bruises everywhere.

464
00:21:23,268 --> 00:21:25,269
Is it really
preposterous

465
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:27,021
that dreams can have
physical manifestations?

466
00:21:27,105 --> 00:21:29,807
Well,
short answer is--

467
00:21:29,858 --> 00:21:31,826
Thoughts during sleep

468
00:21:31,910 --> 00:21:34,111
can and do cause
physical changes.

469
00:21:34,162 --> 00:21:35,362
Is that right,
Dr. Park?

470
00:21:35,447 --> 00:21:37,114
<i>Did you wake up</i>
<i>this morning</i>

471
00:21:37,165 --> 00:21:39,834
experiencing
physical changes?

472
00:21:39,918 --> 00:21:41,252
It's medically relevant.

473
00:21:41,319 --> 00:21:42,670
Her dream
doesn't mean anything.

474
00:21:42,754 --> 00:21:44,622
Can we start acting like
it doesn't mean anything?

475
00:21:44,673 --> 00:21:45,790
<i>Sure.</i>

476
00:21:45,841 --> 00:21:46,824
We could also start
acting like walls

477
00:21:46,875 --> 00:21:47,958
don't mean anything,

478
00:21:48,009 --> 00:21:49,376
but then we'd
hurt our noses.

479
00:21:49,461 --> 00:21:51,095
<i>You've been taking</i>
<i>the high road.</i>

480
00:21:51,162 --> 00:21:53,497
You haven't been teasing in
an obviously teasable situation

481
00:21:53,548 --> 00:21:55,165
because you know
it does mean something.

482
00:21:55,217 --> 00:21:56,934
<i>She hates the dream</i>
<i>because it makes her</i>

483
00:21:57,001 --> 00:21:58,018
feel vulnerable.

484
00:21:58,103 --> 00:21:59,220
You love the dream
because it makes you

485
00:21:59,304 --> 00:22:01,555
feel superior.

486
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:02,807
<i>The poor lass</i>
<i>who can't help</i>

487
00:22:02,858 --> 00:22:04,608
<i>but fall sway</i>
<i>to your charms,</i>

488
00:22:04,676 --> 00:22:06,026
<i>and you're</i>
<i>bestowing upon her</i>

489
00:22:06,111 --> 00:22:07,361
the gift of
illusory irrelevance.

490
00:22:07,445 --> 00:22:09,513
Can you please
hint to House

491
00:22:09,564 --> 00:22:10,781
that you
had a sex dream?

492
00:22:10,849 --> 00:22:13,517
I'd really prefer
not to get distracted

493
00:22:13,568 --> 00:22:15,286
with trying to cure
the patient today.

494
00:22:15,353 --> 00:22:16,987
I refuse to divulge
my dreams

495
00:22:17,038 --> 00:22:18,706
about girl-on-girl
loofa action.

496
00:22:18,790 --> 00:22:21,292
<i>The bruising</i>
<i>could indicate anemia,</i>

497
00:22:21,359 --> 00:22:24,328
<i>a vitamin C deficiency,</i>
<i>or even leukemia.</i>

498
00:22:24,379 --> 00:22:26,413
That is so weird
that you and I

499
00:22:26,498 --> 00:22:27,698
had the same dream.

500
00:22:27,766 --> 00:22:29,700
<i>I assume yours also ends</i>

501
00:22:29,751 --> 00:22:32,219
with me achieving ecstasy
while simultaneously

502
00:22:32,304 --> 00:22:34,305
placing third in
the New York City marathon.

503
00:22:34,372 --> 00:22:35,389
Third?

504
00:22:35,473 --> 00:22:38,309
I'm a realist.

505
00:22:38,376 --> 00:22:41,712
Liver failure can cause
gibberish from encephalopathy,

506
00:22:41,763 --> 00:22:44,682
constipation, bruising,
and breathing problems.

507
00:22:44,749 --> 00:22:47,017
Hepatic fibrosis
could hit someone his age.

508
00:22:47,068 --> 00:22:49,887
So let's hit his liver.

509
00:22:49,938 --> 00:22:52,823
Get a biopsy.

510
00:22:54,526 --> 00:22:57,328
Angle a bit
more superiorly.

511
00:23:00,949 --> 00:23:02,833
<i>He keeps having</i>
<i>these nightmares</i>

512
00:23:02,901 --> 00:23:07,621
that become real.
They really hurt him.

513
00:23:07,706 --> 00:23:09,373
I don't want to believe
that a nightmare

514
00:23:09,424 --> 00:23:10,741
can do that, but I--

515
00:23:10,792 --> 00:23:12,843
I'm struggling
with it too,

516
00:23:12,911 --> 00:23:15,579
but these things can be
explained medically.

517
00:23:15,630 --> 00:23:19,283
But you haven't.

518
00:23:19,351 --> 00:23:20,284
Every Doctor,

519
00:23:20,352 --> 00:23:22,102
<i>every idea they've had,</i>

520
00:23:22,187 --> 00:23:25,022
it's been wrong.

521
00:23:30,445 --> 00:23:34,198
Liver biopsy's back.
Team's about to meet.

522
00:23:34,265 --> 00:23:38,435
Back to avoiding
eye contact with me?

523
00:23:38,486 --> 00:23:39,954
House got to you again?

524
00:23:40,038 --> 00:23:42,773
Want me to gaze
longingly into your eyes

525
00:23:42,824 --> 00:23:45,826
as I tell you
the test results?

526
00:23:45,911 --> 00:23:49,380
I want you to treat me
like a friend,

527
00:23:49,447 --> 00:23:50,831
which means
getting over the fact

528
00:23:50,916 --> 00:23:52,833
that you like me
more than I like you.

529
00:23:52,918 --> 00:23:56,337
Yeah, egotism and preening
really turn me on.

530
00:23:56,421 --> 00:24:00,007
Too bad I'm not attracted
to androgyny and self-pity,

531
00:24:00,091 --> 00:24:01,291
or you'd have it made.

532
00:24:01,343 --> 00:24:03,394
Because anyone
who hasn't gotten wet

533
00:24:03,461 --> 00:24:05,295
from your petri dish
of STDs

534
00:24:05,347 --> 00:24:08,565
clearly has
low self-esteem!

535
00:24:08,633 --> 00:24:09,600
Bitch.

536
00:24:09,651 --> 00:24:13,187
Dick!

537
00:24:28,003 --> 00:24:30,421
You coming?

538
00:24:30,488 --> 00:24:32,539
Why didn't your lips move
when you said that?

539
00:24:32,624 --> 00:24:33,524
<i>Chase!</i>

540
00:24:33,591 --> 00:24:36,961
You coming?

541
00:24:37,028 --> 00:24:39,847
Liver biopsy's back.

542
00:24:42,434 --> 00:24:45,853
I'll be right there.

543
00:24:49,891 --> 00:24:51,692
Biopsy was negative
for fibrosis.

544
00:24:51,776 --> 00:24:53,027
So once again,

545
00:24:53,111 --> 00:24:54,361
you don't know
what's wrong?

546
00:24:54,446 --> 00:24:57,064
It's always good
to rule out the bad things.

547
00:24:57,148 --> 00:24:59,950
<i>Doctors!</i>

548
00:25:04,372 --> 00:25:07,241
God!

549
00:25:19,587 --> 00:25:20,738
Was he?

550
00:25:20,805 --> 00:25:23,640
Yes.

551
00:25:29,023 --> 00:25:31,208
He was levitating.
Cool.

552
00:25:32,013 --> 00:25:33,380
So the one thing
we know for sure

553
00:25:33,431 --> 00:25:35,582
is he was not
levitating.

554
00:25:35,650 --> 00:25:37,250
He was floating

555
00:25:37,301 --> 00:25:38,969
6 inches off the bed.

556
00:25:39,053 --> 00:25:41,805
He could've just been arching
his back off the bed.

557
00:25:41,889 --> 00:25:43,556
Yes, but then I would have
come into the room

558
00:25:43,607 --> 00:25:45,725
and reported
that the patient

559
00:25:45,776 --> 00:25:47,927
was weirdly arching
his back off the bed.

560
00:25:47,979 --> 00:25:51,231
It was his whole body.
He was levitating.

561
00:25:51,282 --> 00:25:53,566
So many questions...

562
00:25:53,617 --> 00:25:56,619
Starting with why did Chase
address his comment

563
00:25:56,704 --> 00:26:00,440
to someone who wasn't
even in the room?

564
00:26:00,491 --> 00:26:03,293
Hocus pocus,

565
00:26:03,377 --> 00:26:07,180
on my feet
you idiots must focus.

566
00:26:17,141 --> 00:26:18,458
The kid's
not a magician.

567
00:26:18,509 --> 00:26:20,977
Of course not.
He's the lovely assistant.

568
00:26:21,062 --> 00:26:23,813
'Cause grandpa pig sticker
is waving the wand.

569
00:26:23,898 --> 00:26:26,766
Middling with...

570
00:26:26,817 --> 00:26:28,518
is Chase trying
to avoid Taub,

571
00:26:28,602 --> 00:26:30,136
or is he trying
to prove

572
00:26:30,187 --> 00:26:31,354
that he's not
avoiding Park?

573
00:26:31,439 --> 00:26:32,522
<i>We checked the bed.</i>

574
00:26:32,606 --> 00:26:34,524
There were no platforms
or wires.

575
00:26:34,608 --> 00:26:35,692
This wasn't a trick.

576
00:26:35,776 --> 00:26:37,777
Tetanus could cause
muscle rigidity.

577
00:26:37,828 --> 00:26:39,996
<i>Maybe he was propped up</i>
<i>by his heel and elbow.</i>

578
00:26:40,081 --> 00:26:40,997
Except he wasn't!

579
00:26:41,082 --> 00:26:42,048
<i>Tetanus wouldn't cause</i>

580
00:26:42,116 --> 00:26:44,784
that kind of
breathing difficulty.

581
00:26:44,835 --> 00:26:45,919
And ending with...

582
00:26:45,986 --> 00:26:47,587
if Chase is trying
not to avoid Park,

583
00:26:47,654 --> 00:26:50,323
why is he doing this
today and not yesterday?

584
00:26:50,391 --> 00:26:52,842
But hypocalcemia could,

585
00:26:52,927 --> 00:26:53,960
<i>and the enema</i>
<i>we administered</i>

586
00:26:54,028 --> 00:26:55,011
<i>to cure</i>
<i>his constipation</i>

587
00:26:55,096 --> 00:26:56,546
<i>had a high</i>
<i>phosphorous load,</i>

588
00:26:56,630 --> 00:26:59,165
which could make him
transiently hypocalcemic.

589
00:26:59,233 --> 00:27:01,834
It's a long shot,
but at least

590
00:27:01,886 --> 00:27:03,636
it has the benefit
of being rational.

591
00:27:03,687 --> 00:27:05,188
Go pump up
his electrolytes

592
00:27:05,272 --> 00:27:08,224
and start
beta-blockers.

593
00:27:08,309 --> 00:27:11,111
And good news
for Park:

594
00:27:11,178 --> 00:27:15,281
I think Chase
had a sex dream about you.

595
00:27:15,349 --> 00:27:19,219
Dreams don't
mean anything.

596
00:27:19,286 --> 00:27:21,488
<i>I don't know.</i>
<i>Nothing you've done has helped.</i>

597
00:27:21,539 --> 00:27:23,856
If we don't start
and he has another seizure,

598
00:27:23,908 --> 00:27:27,744
the neurological damage
could be permanent.

599
00:27:27,828 --> 00:27:29,996
My father-in-law--

600
00:27:30,047 --> 00:27:31,331
he thinks
the calling ceremony

601
00:27:31,398 --> 00:27:32,966
didn't work because Lue
wasn't there.

602
00:27:33,033 --> 00:27:36,536
And you think
he's right?

603
00:27:36,587 --> 00:27:37,804
I don't know.

604
00:27:37,871 --> 00:27:39,806
I'm sorry,
but there's no way

605
00:27:39,873 --> 00:27:41,508
we can allow him
to perform an exorcism

606
00:27:41,559 --> 00:27:44,260
in your son's
hospital room.

607
00:27:44,345 --> 00:27:47,847
Then I will have
to take him home.

608
00:27:47,915 --> 00:27:49,115
A day ago,
you were insulted

609
00:27:49,183 --> 00:27:50,717
I'd even think you might
believe that stuff,

610
00:27:50,785 --> 00:27:52,619
<i>and now you're willing</i>
<i>to stop all treatment,</i>

611
00:27:52,686 --> 00:27:54,887
<i>so you can try it?</i>

612
00:27:54,939 --> 00:27:58,391
Maybe Xang
was right about Kao.

613
00:27:58,442 --> 00:28:00,226
The man I loved
wasn't evil

614
00:28:00,277 --> 00:28:03,163
and would never do
what he did.

615
00:28:07,418 --> 00:28:11,070
He was...possessed.

616
00:28:14,508 --> 00:28:17,977
And my son needs
his soul back.

617
00:28:18,045 --> 00:28:19,546
Why not?

618
00:28:19,597 --> 00:28:21,264
<i>As long as he doesn't</i>
<i>feed the kid anything</i>

619
00:28:21,348 --> 00:28:23,299
or put anything on his skin
that we haven't

620
00:28:23,384 --> 00:28:24,717
verified is harmless,
what's the problem?

621
00:28:24,768 --> 00:28:26,136
I agree.

622
00:28:26,220 --> 00:28:27,854
And since we're
establishing a new policy

623
00:28:27,921 --> 00:28:29,272
of "What the hell,
we'll try anything,"

624
00:28:29,356 --> 00:28:31,274
I'd like to hire Shakira
to belly dance

625
00:28:31,358 --> 00:28:32,942
while singing <i>Waka Waka.</i>

626
00:28:33,027 --> 00:28:36,146
As long as you get the mom
and Shakira to consent.

627
00:28:36,230 --> 00:28:37,930
<i>It's no different</i>
<i>than having a priest</i>

628
00:28:37,982 --> 00:28:40,400
or rabbi
lead a prayer vigil.

629
00:28:40,451 --> 00:28:41,901
The mom is scared
and confused

630
00:28:41,952 --> 00:28:45,572
<i>and desperate for anything</i>
<i>that'll give her hope.</i>

631
00:28:45,623 --> 00:28:46,956
True.

632
00:28:47,041 --> 00:28:48,575
But in the long run,
I think you'll be happier

633
00:28:48,626 --> 00:28:50,543
having our lawyer
declare her unfit.

634
00:28:50,611 --> 00:28:54,113
That way you won't be ratifying
superstition over science,

635
00:28:54,165 --> 00:28:55,948
and I'll still
be working here.

636
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,084
And why would that
make me happier?

637
00:28:58,135 --> 00:29:00,119
You're not going anywhere,

638
00:29:00,171 --> 00:29:01,971
and we're not "ratifying"
their beliefs,

639
00:29:02,056 --> 00:29:03,456
we're respecting them.

640
00:29:03,507 --> 00:29:07,310
You do realize it may
involve animal sacrifice.

641
00:29:08,795 --> 00:29:11,464
People who live
in glass hospitals

642
00:29:11,515 --> 00:29:13,850
should not
throw exorcisms.

643
00:29:13,934 --> 00:29:16,653
I'll talk
to the mother.

644
00:29:18,856 --> 00:29:20,523
I don't want to deny him
the medicine,

645
00:29:20,608 --> 00:29:21,858
I just...

646
00:29:21,942 --> 00:29:25,578
want to make sure
I try everything I can.

647
00:29:26,780 --> 00:29:29,148
I understand that,

648
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:32,151
but you have to understand
that we're a hospital,

649
00:29:32,203 --> 00:29:35,505
not a temple.

650
00:29:35,589 --> 00:29:37,290
Then I'll
take him elsewhere.

651
00:29:37,358 --> 00:29:38,858
No, you won't.

652
00:29:38,926 --> 00:29:41,594
<i>He's sick.</i>
<i>We can't let him leave here.</i>

653
00:29:41,662 --> 00:29:44,864
I'm sorry, you really
have no choice.

654
00:29:48,852 --> 00:29:51,604
I spoke to a lawyer.

655
00:29:51,672 --> 00:29:54,641
He told me as long
as I wasn't saying no

656
00:29:54,692 --> 00:29:57,810
to your treatment,
you couldn't say no

657
00:29:57,861 --> 00:30:01,864
to my religion.

658
00:30:06,370 --> 00:30:10,206
Give me 24 hours.

659
00:30:25,172 --> 00:30:27,974
This came
in the mail today!

660
00:30:32,396 --> 00:30:33,446
I'm sorry.

661
00:30:33,514 --> 00:30:34,931
<i>I should've told you.</i>

662
00:30:35,015 --> 00:30:37,066
Told me what?

663
00:30:37,151 --> 00:30:40,019
I don't understand.

664
00:30:42,089 --> 00:30:43,055
What's the letter?

665
00:30:43,107 --> 00:30:44,774
It's from my Uncle
in Poland.

666
00:30:44,858 --> 00:30:48,578
My Aunt Luba, they put her
in nursing home two months ago!

667
00:30:49,730 --> 00:30:50,830
That's too bad.

668
00:30:50,897 --> 00:30:52,582
My mother, I talk
to her twice a week

669
00:30:52,666 --> 00:30:54,751
and she never
even mentioned it.

670
00:30:54,835 --> 00:30:56,536
Wh--what does she think?
That I can't handle?

671
00:30:56,587 --> 00:31:00,406
I am 29 years old!
I am not a child!

672
00:31:06,297 --> 00:31:10,049
Were you going out
tonight?

673
00:31:12,619 --> 00:31:15,455
I could stay.

674
00:31:28,619 --> 00:31:31,904
He's still
barely breathing.

675
00:31:31,955 --> 00:31:32,938
Lue?

676
00:31:32,990 --> 00:31:34,457
How you feeling?

677
00:31:34,541 --> 00:31:37,744
Any stronger?

678
00:31:37,795 --> 00:31:38,944
Lue, can you hear me?

679
00:31:38,996 --> 00:31:40,880
What's wrong?
I'm not sure.

680
00:31:40,947 --> 00:31:45,117
Lue, I need you
to squeeze my hand.

681
00:31:45,169 --> 00:31:48,004
He's not responding.
Get me an amp of D50!

682
00:31:49,256 --> 00:31:52,124
You were wrong again?

683
00:31:57,264 --> 00:32:01,067
I'm calling
his grandfather.

684
00:32:36,292 --> 00:32:38,627
<i>Genetic tests for Brugada</i>
<i>and long QT variants</i>

685
00:32:38,711 --> 00:32:39,745
<i>came back negative.</i>

686
00:32:39,796 --> 00:32:41,179
What about
a carotid aneurysm?

687
00:32:41,247 --> 00:32:42,280
<i>We should do</i>
<i>an angiogram.</i>

688
00:32:42,348 --> 00:32:44,249
He's got normal
carotid pulses.

689
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:46,501
Who cares?

690
00:32:46,586 --> 00:32:48,787
Mom's given up,
why shouldn't I?

691
00:32:48,838 --> 00:32:50,005
I'm sorry,

692
00:32:50,089 --> 00:32:52,224
do we not treat idiots?
Because I thought--

693
00:32:52,291 --> 00:32:53,225
<i>Her kid levitated.</i>

694
00:32:53,292 --> 00:32:54,309
That happens to my girl,

695
00:32:54,394 --> 00:32:56,511
I'm expanding
my diagnostic horizons.

696
00:32:56,596 --> 00:32:58,764
All the more reason
why we should shut down.

697
00:32:58,831 --> 00:33:00,315
<i>We cure this kid now,</i>

698
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:01,933
<i>crazy grandpa</i>
<i>and his magic beads</i>

699
00:33:01,984 --> 00:33:04,019
get all the credit.

700
00:33:04,103 --> 00:33:06,104
And since when do you care
about credit?

701
00:33:06,155 --> 00:33:08,907
Since when do I care
about this kid?

702
00:33:08,974 --> 00:33:11,359
All I care about
is sending mommy

703
00:33:11,444 --> 00:33:14,312
out into the world
having faith in faith.

704
00:33:14,363 --> 00:33:17,282
Kid's better off dead.

705
00:33:17,333 --> 00:33:20,452
As soon as she's done
appeasing the Gods, let's talk.

706
00:33:20,503 --> 00:33:21,787
What about Kawasaki?

707
00:33:21,838 --> 00:33:23,371
<i>It explains</i>
<i>the irregular heartbeat,</i>

708
00:33:23,456 --> 00:33:24,673
<i>respiratory distress,</i>
<i>and seizures.</i>

709
00:33:24,757 --> 00:33:26,124
It fits.

710
00:33:26,175 --> 00:33:29,127
Which means he needs
a coronary bypass.

711
00:33:29,178 --> 00:33:31,179
<i>It can't be Kawasaki.</i>

712
00:33:31,264 --> 00:33:33,799
Echo would have
shown it.

713
00:33:33,850 --> 00:33:35,517
But a patent ductus
arteriosis--

714
00:33:35,601 --> 00:33:37,269
it can't be a PDA.
He's not an infant,

715
00:33:37,336 --> 00:33:39,438
nor has he had any symptoms
for eight years.

716
00:33:39,505 --> 00:33:40,672
Maybe he has.

717
00:33:40,723 --> 00:33:42,107
Maybe he had
an infected ductus,

718
00:33:42,174 --> 00:33:44,893
which we inadvertently
treated with antibiotics.

719
00:33:44,977 --> 00:33:47,395
So no evidence
is evidence of evidence?

720
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:49,364
I'm just saying,
it's consistent.

721
00:33:49,449 --> 00:33:50,615
It's a billion-to-one.

722
00:33:50,683 --> 00:33:52,400
Which means there's
seven people in the world

723
00:33:52,485 --> 00:33:53,852
who fit the diagnosis.

724
00:33:53,903 --> 00:33:55,036
I thought we were
looking for 100.

725
00:33:55,121 --> 00:33:57,289
Well, maybe PDA

726
00:33:57,356 --> 00:33:58,707
is more common
than we thought.

727
00:33:58,791 --> 00:33:59,858
With idiot doctors
like you--

728
00:33:59,909 --> 00:34:02,077
You're wrong.

729
00:34:02,161 --> 00:34:04,162
But the treatment's
just ibuprofen.

730
00:34:04,230 --> 00:34:06,531
<i>Closes</i>
<i>the malformed duct.</i>

731
00:34:06,599 --> 00:34:08,467
Worst-case scenario,
he just doesn't get better,

732
00:34:08,534 --> 00:34:11,670
No, worst-case scenario
is you piss me off--

733
00:34:11,721 --> 00:34:13,221
You're not gonna let us
save an eight-year-old

734
00:34:13,306 --> 00:34:15,373
because one more person
might embrace religion?

735
00:34:17,977 --> 00:34:21,263
Does anyone here think
my diagnosis is right?

736
00:34:23,015 --> 00:34:25,233
Well, then
I have decided,

737
00:34:25,318 --> 00:34:28,770
for today only,
to respect your opinions.

738
00:34:28,855 --> 00:34:31,022
We will proceed
according to your diagnosis

739
00:34:31,073 --> 00:34:33,825
and nothing else.

740
00:34:33,893 --> 00:34:36,495
That's an order.

741
00:34:36,562 --> 00:34:38,413
Good luck.

742
00:34:46,038 --> 00:34:49,758
We need to put him
on the O.R. schedule.

743
00:35:01,220 --> 00:35:02,187
<i>His B.P.'s dropping.</i>

744
00:35:02,254 --> 00:35:03,939
He's crashing.
Call a code!

745
00:35:09,228 --> 00:35:12,931
You need to stop this!

746
00:35:15,368 --> 00:35:19,154
I'm giving him
the ibuprofen.

747
00:35:41,293 --> 00:35:45,146
Dinner's almost ready.

748
00:35:45,231 --> 00:35:49,801
I think I'll stick with
the fluids tonight, thanks.

749
00:35:49,852 --> 00:35:51,019
Why are you sulking?

750
00:35:51,103 --> 00:35:53,438
I'm not sulking.

751
00:35:53,489 --> 00:35:57,275
Oh, my mistake.

752
00:36:04,250 --> 00:36:06,001
Mmm.

753
00:36:06,085 --> 00:36:08,336
Either religion
is killing a kid,

754
00:36:08,421 --> 00:36:12,290
or I am.

755
00:36:22,768 --> 00:36:25,353
What are you doing?

756
00:36:25,438 --> 00:36:29,174
Comforting my husband
after a bad day.

757
00:36:40,369 --> 00:36:41,519
If this is not
what you want,

758
00:36:41,570 --> 00:36:44,322
I go back
to making dinner.

759
00:37:14,220 --> 00:37:15,236
I'm not
gonna answer that.

760
00:37:15,321 --> 00:37:17,522
Oh, smart man.

761
00:37:24,063 --> 00:37:25,664
This is killing mood.

762
00:37:28,117 --> 00:37:30,001
U.S. citizenship!

763
00:37:30,069 --> 00:37:31,036
I'll get it.

764
00:37:31,087 --> 00:37:32,737
This is Mrs. House,

765
00:37:32,788 --> 00:37:34,122
please give good news,
so my husband and I

766
00:37:34,206 --> 00:37:37,308
can go back to sex.

767
00:37:37,376 --> 00:37:41,245
<i>Budmo!</i> Is fantastic!

768
00:37:50,272 --> 00:37:54,025
How many notices
you send me?

769
00:37:57,863 --> 00:38:03,201
O-okay, I--I come pick up
naturalization certificate.

770
00:38:03,268 --> 00:38:07,105
Thank you for calling.

771
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:17,132
I'm sorry.

772
00:38:28,344 --> 00:38:30,128
Dr. Adams, Dr. Taub?

773
00:38:30,179 --> 00:38:34,983
His vitals are improving.
He's stabilizing.

774
00:38:41,190 --> 00:38:45,076
He's gonna be okay.

775
00:38:46,478 --> 00:38:48,863
It worked.

776
00:38:48,948 --> 00:38:51,649
Um, no, it didn't.

777
00:38:51,700 --> 00:38:53,368
Mrs. Cheng, the medicine
I administered

778
00:38:53,452 --> 00:38:55,754
was a long-shot treatment
for Lue's heart,

779
00:38:55,821 --> 00:38:59,124
but that's
what's helping him.

780
00:38:59,175 --> 00:39:00,959
Ibuprofen?

781
00:39:01,010 --> 00:39:02,377
That's for headaches.

782
00:39:02,461 --> 00:39:03,795
I know it seems
hard to believe,

783
00:39:03,846 --> 00:39:06,347
but it's true.

784
00:39:06,432 --> 00:39:08,733
And I know this seems hard
for you to believe.

785
00:39:16,008 --> 00:39:18,026
Honey...

786
00:39:18,110 --> 00:39:19,277
Grandpa was right.

787
00:39:19,344 --> 00:39:22,197
He saved you.

788
00:39:25,901 --> 00:39:29,788
There were two things
we thought were impossible.

789
00:39:29,855 --> 00:39:32,457
One of them wasn't.

790
00:39:32,524 --> 00:39:35,376
That's all we know.

791
00:39:44,336 --> 00:39:47,305
[Wilco's <i>Black Moon]</i>

792
00:39:47,372 --> 00:39:54,846
? ?

793
00:39:54,897 --> 00:39:59,717
? I was always right ?

794
00:40:03,522 --> 00:40:08,276
? about the morning ?

795
00:40:09,829 --> 00:40:15,583
? okay, I'm an old shoe ?

796
00:40:19,738 --> 00:40:25,510
? danced above the blaze ?

797
00:40:28,514 --> 00:40:34,269
? never stopped crawling ?

798
00:40:34,353 --> 00:40:36,554
? over ?

799
00:40:38,590 --> 00:40:41,693
? The black dunes ?

800
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:49,534
? ?

801
00:40:51,036 --> 00:40:54,405
? and I'm waiting
for you ?

802
00:40:54,456 --> 00:40:56,824
Was I good?

803
00:40:56,909 --> 00:40:58,710
Doesn't mean anything.

804
00:40:58,777 --> 00:41:02,714
Idea got planted.
It was probably inevitable.

805
00:41:05,450 --> 00:41:08,119
It means something.

806
00:41:08,170 --> 00:41:10,004
What?

807
00:41:10,089 --> 00:41:11,890
Well, it could
mean the obvious,

808
00:41:11,957 --> 00:41:13,641
that you want
some of this.

809
00:41:14,977 --> 00:41:19,681
When will you learn that
that look is insulting?

810
00:41:24,970 --> 00:41:28,907
Or it could just mean
that we like each other.

811
00:41:28,974 --> 00:41:32,176
I'm weird,
and you're pretty,

812
00:41:32,244 --> 00:41:37,148
but we connect.
We feel safe.

813
00:41:37,199 --> 00:41:40,618
We trust
each other.

814
00:41:40,669 --> 00:41:45,657
Maybe.

815
00:41:48,227 --> 00:41:50,878
Just testing
my theory.

816
00:42:00,439 --> 00:42:02,440
Adams defied me.

817
00:42:02,507 --> 00:42:06,527
There's one more zealot
in the world.

818
00:42:06,612 --> 00:42:09,881
And Dominika moved out.

819
00:42:11,483 --> 00:42:14,218
<i>She was fun.</i>
<i>She was hot.</i>

820
00:42:14,286 --> 00:42:16,537
<i>She fixed my blender.</i>

821
00:42:16,622 --> 00:42:19,123
That is not
a metaphor.

822
00:42:19,191 --> 00:42:23,027
You know any good
fake divorce lawyers?

823
00:42:23,078 --> 00:42:25,964
I am surprisingly
depressed by this.

824
00:42:31,236 --> 00:42:34,088
I have cancer.

825
00:42:37,426 --> 00:42:39,377
You were a little short
with me the other day.

826
00:42:39,428 --> 00:42:41,879
You do need an excuse.
Cancer may be overplaying it.

827
00:42:41,930 --> 00:42:44,582
Stage II Thymoma.

828
00:42:46,235 --> 00:42:50,688
I didn't want to tell you
until I had it confirmed.

829
00:42:50,739 --> 00:42:55,777
I got the tests back
this morning.

830
00:42:55,861 --> 00:43:00,698
I have cancer, House.
