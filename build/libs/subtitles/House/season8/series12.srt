1
00:00:08,784 --> 00:00:10,684
You're bleeding
through your bandage.

2
00:00:16,889 --> 00:00:18,256
Good morning.

3
00:00:18,323 --> 00:00:20,659
Don't we need to get you
to a doctor?

4
00:00:20,727 --> 00:00:22,694
I am a doctor.

5
00:00:22,762 --> 00:00:24,830
That didn't come up
last night?

6
00:00:24,898 --> 00:00:26,899
We didn't do
a lot of talking.

7
00:00:42,717 --> 00:00:44,751
I'm good.

8
00:00:57,462 --> 00:00:59,129
You never told me
what caused your accident.

9
00:00:59,197 --> 00:01:03,067
I was stabbed
by a patient.

10
00:01:03,135 --> 00:01:04,736
<i>That'll teach me</i>
<i>to overbill.</i>

11
00:01:39,105 --> 00:01:40,706
If she likes
crippled guys,

12
00:01:40,774 --> 00:01:42,441
I'm free for
the next six minutes.

13
00:01:42,509 --> 00:01:43,642
What do you want?

14
00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:45,845
45-year-old
truck driver,

15
00:01:45,912 --> 00:01:47,279
recurrent seizures.

16
00:01:47,347 --> 00:01:48,648
No metabolic
or structural--

17
00:01:48,715 --> 00:01:49,982
does this look
like a good time?

18
00:01:50,050 --> 00:01:51,817
Sort of.

19
00:01:51,885 --> 00:01:53,786
At least as good
as the other 12 times

20
00:01:53,854 --> 00:01:56,422
that I've called and paged you
in the last three weeks.

21
00:01:56,489 --> 00:01:57,990
Those times I just didn't
feel like talking to you.

22
00:01:58,057 --> 00:01:59,057
Kinda like now.

23
00:01:59,125 --> 00:02:00,458
<i>I'd apologize again,</i>

24
00:02:00,526 --> 00:02:03,595
but I'm still waiting for you
to accept the first one.

25
00:02:03,663 --> 00:02:05,563
You do work for me.

26
00:02:05,631 --> 00:02:07,565
I am entitled to ask
when you're coming back.

27
00:02:07,633 --> 00:02:09,066
I don't know
when I'm coming back.

28
00:02:09,134 --> 00:02:10,534
I don't know
if I'm coming back.

29
00:02:10,602 --> 00:02:12,102
Got a problem
with that,

30
00:02:12,170 --> 00:02:14,638
fire me.

31

[Massive Attack's <i>Teardrop]</i>

33
00:02:28,376 --> 00:02:50,777
?

34
00:03:00,681 --> 00:03:01,715
Nice.

35
00:03:05,287 --> 00:03:07,155
It's good to see you
in the hospital,

36
00:03:07,222 --> 00:03:08,856
as a patient
if not as a doctor.

37
00:03:08,923 --> 00:03:11,125
Believe me,

38
00:03:11,193 --> 00:03:15,196
I'd rather be the guy
with the clipboard.

39
00:03:15,264 --> 00:03:16,632
How you doing?

40
00:03:18,768 --> 00:03:20,703
Arrhythmias are gone.

41
00:03:20,771 --> 00:03:22,238
Fine motor control
is improving.

42
00:03:22,306 --> 00:03:25,074
Not what I meant.

43
00:03:25,142 --> 00:03:27,343
If you need to talk
to someone,

44
00:03:27,411 --> 00:03:29,411
a professional...

45
00:03:29,479 --> 00:03:32,047
I'm fine.

46
00:03:32,115 --> 00:03:34,082
Fine enough
to get back to work?

47
00:03:36,519 --> 00:03:38,587
You don't have
to work for House,

48
00:03:38,654 --> 00:03:40,955
but you do owe me
20 clinic hours.

49
00:03:41,023 --> 00:03:43,824
What, getting knifed doesn't
buy me an extension?

50
00:03:43,892 --> 00:03:46,326
Buys you whatever you need.

51
00:03:46,394 --> 00:03:47,728
But I know you.

52
00:03:47,796 --> 00:03:50,064
If all you do
is physical therapy

53
00:03:50,132 --> 00:03:51,532
and your nighttime
version of it,

54
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:53,133
you'll lose your mind

55
00:03:53,201 --> 00:03:56,704
faster than you regain
those fine motor skills.

56
00:04:06,215 --> 00:04:08,583
I, uh, have
this terrible pain

57
00:04:08,651 --> 00:04:10,419
in my left shoulder.

58
00:04:10,486 --> 00:04:12,521
It came out of nowhere.

59
00:04:12,589 --> 00:04:16,059
And nothing
seems to help.

60
00:04:18,929 --> 00:04:20,963
Any other symptoms?

61
00:04:21,031 --> 00:04:23,165
Chest pain?
Lightheadedness?

62
00:04:23,233 --> 00:04:25,300
No. None at all.

63
00:04:25,368 --> 00:04:26,768
What were you doing
when the pain came on?

64
00:04:26,836 --> 00:04:28,870
Just sitting
and praying.

65
00:04:28,938 --> 00:04:30,872
<i>She'd been helping to make</i>
<i>the altar breads that morning,</i>

66
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:33,741
but no hard physical work
or repetitive motion.

67
00:04:33,809 --> 00:04:35,809
A couple of possibilities.

68
00:04:35,877 --> 00:04:37,478
You have enlarged
lymph nodes,

69
00:04:37,545 --> 00:04:39,646
so I'd like to start
by ruling out breast cancer.

70
00:04:39,714 --> 00:04:42,115
<i>And I do mean "rule out."</i>

71
00:04:42,183 --> 00:04:43,416
<i>It's probably nothing.</i>

72
00:04:43,484 --> 00:04:45,919
I'm gonna do
a quick breast exam.

73
00:04:45,987 --> 00:04:47,020
Do you mind stepping out
for a moment?

74
00:04:49,057 --> 00:04:51,859
Not at all.

75
00:04:55,698 --> 00:04:58,000
That was so I could ask
about the second possibility.

76
00:04:58,068 --> 00:05:00,569
Left-sided pain means
it could be angina,

77
00:05:00,636 --> 00:05:02,904
which is made worse
by stress.

78
00:05:02,972 --> 00:05:04,773
Might not be a coincidence
that the pain started

79
00:05:04,841 --> 00:05:07,375
on the verge
of a major life change.

80
00:05:07,443 --> 00:05:09,177
How did you know?

81
00:05:09,245 --> 00:05:10,879
Blue veil means
you're a postulant,

82
00:05:10,947 --> 00:05:12,648
haven't taken
your vows yet.

83
00:05:12,715 --> 00:05:14,883
Brown vestments means
you're carmelites,

84
00:05:14,951 --> 00:05:16,184
cloistered nuns,

85
00:05:16,252 --> 00:05:17,886
which explains the chaperone.

86
00:05:21,023 --> 00:05:24,592
You're about to withdraw
from the world for good.

87
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:26,260
I was a seminarian.

88
00:05:26,328 --> 00:05:28,462
Who obviously didn't
take his vows.

89
00:05:28,530 --> 00:05:30,264
Cassock made
my ass look fat.

90
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,534
Do you mind
unbuttoning your shirt

91
00:05:33,601 --> 00:05:34,768
and lying down for me?

92
00:05:34,836 --> 00:05:36,303
Okay.

93
00:05:36,370 --> 00:05:38,772
I have had second thoughts.

94
00:05:38,839 --> 00:05:42,775
I'm kind of a wreck.

95
00:05:44,979 --> 00:05:46,379
A life of perpetual
enclosure

96
00:05:46,447 --> 00:05:48,281
and almost complete silence?

97
00:05:48,349 --> 00:05:49,716
If you weren't
wrestling with this,

98
00:05:49,783 --> 00:05:52,051
I'd say there's something
really wrong with you.

99
00:05:58,126 --> 00:05:59,627
I'm going to admit you.

100
00:05:59,695 --> 00:06:00,928
There's a little mass here,

101
00:06:00,996 --> 00:06:03,831
and I'd like
to get it checked out.

102
00:06:03,899 --> 00:06:05,900
It's just a benign
fat deposit.

103
00:06:05,968 --> 00:06:07,436
Her imaging's clean.

104
00:06:07,503 --> 00:06:09,871
Stress test too.
It's not angina.

105
00:06:09,939 --> 00:06:11,807
So why the shoulder pain?

106
00:06:11,875 --> 00:06:14,110
<i>Is it possible</i>

107
00:06:14,177 --> 00:06:16,112
that she hurt
her shoulder?

108
00:06:16,179 --> 00:06:18,948
Thanks a lot.
I didn't tell him.

109
00:06:19,016 --> 00:06:20,816
You were cagey
about where you were going.

110
00:06:20,884 --> 00:06:22,852
And Chase being cagey
in general.

111
00:06:22,919 --> 00:06:24,987
Good chance I'd find the two
of you in the same cage.

112
00:06:25,055 --> 00:06:27,022
So I had park follow you.

113
00:06:27,089 --> 00:06:29,691
How you feeling?

114
00:06:29,758 --> 00:06:31,559
Better.

115
00:06:31,627 --> 00:06:33,427
Heard your arm's
healing nicely.

116
00:06:33,495 --> 00:06:35,763
Good to see you
on your feet.

117
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:37,164
Patient's a nun?

118
00:06:37,232 --> 00:06:38,899
You turning back to your
long-abandoned faith

119
00:06:38,967 --> 00:06:40,534
in time of trouble?

120
00:06:40,602 --> 00:06:42,503
She was next up
in the clinic.

121
00:06:42,571 --> 00:06:43,938
And I don't want
your help.

122
00:06:44,006 --> 00:06:45,841
You got stabbed.

123
00:06:45,908 --> 00:06:48,176
You blame me.

124
00:06:48,244 --> 00:06:49,912
But what did
you learn about me

125
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:51,647
that you hadn't known
for years?

126
00:06:51,715 --> 00:06:54,017
Maybe I was an idiot before
and I'm not one now.

127
00:06:54,084 --> 00:06:55,752
Or maybe
the reverse is true.

128
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:57,688
Thanks for all your help.

129
00:07:03,561 --> 00:07:07,563
Your soul sister
is having a fungal infection

130
00:07:07,631 --> 00:07:10,632
from the unprocessed wheat
in the altar breads.

131
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:14,336
Explains the shoulder pain
and the jumbo lymph nodes.

132
00:07:21,810 --> 00:07:24,445
Thanks for all my help.

133
00:07:27,682 --> 00:07:30,518
I'm--I'm sorry
I led House to you.

134
00:07:30,586 --> 00:07:32,787
It's part of the job.

135
00:07:32,855 --> 00:07:35,057
Maybe we could get
a meal after work tonight,

136
00:07:35,125 --> 00:07:39,663
if you want
some companionship.

137
00:07:39,730 --> 00:07:41,531
You asking me out
on a date?

138
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:43,167
No.

139
00:07:43,234 --> 00:07:47,371
I just--
I guess that sounded--

140
00:07:47,438 --> 00:07:49,606
must be scary to be back.

141
00:07:49,674 --> 00:07:52,509
All those knives
and needles.

142
00:07:52,577 --> 00:07:55,712
Infected blood and tissue
everywhere you look.

143
00:07:55,779 --> 00:08:00,083
Just thought you might need
someone to talk to about it.

144
00:08:00,151 --> 00:08:02,752
Just knowing you're there
for me is enough.

145
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:06,090
Thanks.

146
00:08:10,428 --> 00:08:12,062
Ever surf Kirra Point?

147
00:08:14,232 --> 00:08:16,433
Obviously you're Australian.

148
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:20,437
I've surfed all over
the Gold Coast.

149
00:08:20,505 --> 00:08:21,905
Don't tell me you have.

150
00:08:21,973 --> 00:08:24,174
The closest I got
was Waimea Bay.

151
00:08:24,242 --> 00:08:27,244
I grew up on Maui.

152
00:08:29,014 --> 00:08:30,448
If you don't mind me asking,

153
00:08:30,515 --> 00:08:32,450
why are you becoming a nun?

154
00:08:32,518 --> 00:08:35,120
You asking
'cause I surf?

155
00:08:35,188 --> 00:08:37,356
Well, I know that Jesus
walked on water but...

156
00:08:38,759 --> 00:08:41,527
Plus the average postulant
is a lot younger than you.

157
00:08:41,595 --> 00:08:43,695
What were you doing
before this?

158
00:08:43,763 --> 00:08:45,531
Not much of anything.

159
00:08:45,598 --> 00:08:47,500
Worked as a nanny.
Moved around a lot.

160
00:08:47,567 --> 00:08:49,502
Bunch of failed
relationships.

161
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:51,770
And then what?

162
00:08:51,838 --> 00:08:54,607
God spoke to you?
You heard the calling?

163
00:08:54,674 --> 00:08:57,743
Something like that.

164
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,514
Does there have to be
some dramatic moment

165
00:09:01,581 --> 00:09:02,848
where the skies part?

166
00:09:02,915 --> 00:09:05,317
Usually, yeah.

167
00:09:05,384 --> 00:09:08,286
Is that what happened to you
when you entered the seminary?

168
00:09:10,455 --> 00:09:12,656
Mom drank, dad worked.

169
00:09:12,724 --> 00:09:15,058
They stuck me
in catholic school.

170
00:09:15,126 --> 00:09:18,261
Priests and nuns were
the closest I had to family.

171
00:09:18,329 --> 00:09:21,098
Turned out that wasn't much of
a reason to join the priesthood.

172
00:09:21,166 --> 00:09:22,700
Is that why you left?

173
00:09:24,770 --> 00:09:26,170
Something like that.

174
00:09:33,413 --> 00:09:35,614
I think I may throw up.

175
00:09:46,492 --> 00:09:48,893
What's wrong with me?

176
00:09:48,961 --> 00:09:52,163
Not a fungal infection.

177
00:10:00,104 --> 00:10:02,605
You're probably wondering,
why the soda balloons?

178
00:10:02,673 --> 00:10:03,740
I'm not.

179
00:10:03,808 --> 00:10:05,975
Well, I'll tell you.

180
00:10:06,043 --> 00:10:07,410
You're not the only one

181
00:10:07,478 --> 00:10:08,845
whose life spiraled
out of control

182
00:10:08,913 --> 00:10:10,580
when you got knifed
in the ventricle.

183
00:10:10,648 --> 00:10:11,715
Taub has decided--

184
00:10:11,782 --> 00:10:13,016
I need help
with my patient.

185
00:10:13,084 --> 00:10:14,351
She's vomiting.

186
00:10:14,419 --> 00:10:16,119
That's not from
a fungal infection.

187
00:10:16,187 --> 00:10:17,220
What are you
planning to do

188
00:10:17,288 --> 00:10:18,388
now that you're
not working for me?

189
00:10:18,456 --> 00:10:20,457
I have no idea.

190
00:10:20,525 --> 00:10:22,293
Almost dying's
been clarifying.

191
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:23,560
I can do anything.

192
00:10:23,628 --> 00:10:25,663
You can do anything.

193
00:10:25,731 --> 00:10:27,265
So you come back
to the same building

194
00:10:27,332 --> 00:10:29,167
you've worked in
for years.

195
00:10:29,234 --> 00:10:31,669
Guess you can cross that
off your bucket list.

196
00:10:31,737 --> 00:10:33,438
Can we get to my patient
sometime soon?

197
00:10:33,505 --> 00:10:36,875
As soon as you admit that
you're a confused mess, sure.

198
00:10:36,942 --> 00:10:38,343
You'll help me.

199
00:10:38,410 --> 00:10:40,411
'Cause even though you don't
find my case interesting,

200
00:10:40,479 --> 00:10:42,513
you find my interest in it
interesting.

201
00:10:44,116 --> 00:10:47,218
Well, when you
put it that way...

202
00:10:47,286 --> 00:10:48,886
Ascending colangitis.

203
00:10:53,258 --> 00:10:54,659
Missed me.

204
00:10:54,726 --> 00:10:55,759
<i>Can't be,</i>
<i>bilirubin's normal.</i>

205
00:10:55,827 --> 00:10:58,963
Clinical signs
can show up days

206
00:10:59,030 --> 00:11:01,332
<i>before lab signs.</i>

207
00:11:02,868 --> 00:11:04,067
Ha ha ha!

208
00:11:05,938 --> 00:11:07,204
<i>This is great.</i>

209
00:11:07,272 --> 00:11:08,706
<i>We should make this</i>
<i>a regular thing.</i>

210
00:11:12,678 --> 00:11:14,045
She can't feel
her foot at all.

211
00:11:19,118 --> 00:11:20,451
What does this mean?

212
00:11:20,519 --> 00:11:22,253
It means I've got
to spend more time

213
00:11:22,321 --> 00:11:24,722
consulting
with a colleague.

214
00:11:33,352 --> 00:11:35,687
He tried to tongue-kiss Park
when you were closer.

215
00:11:35,755 --> 00:11:37,356
You think his sexuality
is normal?

216
00:11:37,424 --> 00:11:39,892
I need more help.
My patient has a new symptom.

217
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:41,294
<i>Ischemic foot.</i>

218
00:11:41,362 --> 00:11:43,297
Get the lecture
out of your system

219
00:11:43,364 --> 00:11:44,998
so we can talk
about my case.

220
00:11:47,269 --> 00:11:51,872
Let me start
with an allegory.

221
00:11:51,939 --> 00:11:53,239
Ah.

222
00:11:58,079 --> 00:11:59,413
Okay, I'm curious.

223
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:02,616
Your overreaction
to your stabbing

224
00:12:02,684 --> 00:12:05,986
is to blame me even as
you are drawn to me.

225
00:12:06,054 --> 00:12:09,190
Taub's is to take
moronic self-defense classes

226
00:12:09,258 --> 00:12:11,726
that won't defend him
against anything.

227
00:12:11,794 --> 00:12:13,261
Krav maga.

228
00:12:13,329 --> 00:12:14,762
Which helped me
block your shot

229
00:12:14,830 --> 00:12:15,764
and will continue
to help me

230
00:12:15,831 --> 00:12:17,032
defend myself in a building

231
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:18,500
full of drugged-up strangers.

232
00:12:18,568 --> 00:12:21,503
Taub has to accept
that by instinct and genetics

233
00:12:21,571 --> 00:12:23,105
he is a coward,

234
00:12:23,173 --> 00:12:24,340
<i>who's better off</i>
<i>running and hiding</i>

235
00:12:24,407 --> 00:12:25,908
<i>at the first sign</i>
<i>of danger.</i>

236
00:12:25,976 --> 00:12:28,577
I've already fended off six
of your blitzkriegs in a row.

237
00:12:28,645 --> 00:12:30,579
And the seventh?
And the eighth?

238
00:12:30,647 --> 00:12:32,748
And the nth?

239
00:12:32,815 --> 00:12:33,749
If you get him,
what's that gonna prove?

240
00:12:33,816 --> 00:12:35,716
That unexpected things happen.

241
00:12:35,784 --> 00:12:38,919
<i>By definition, no class can</i>
<i>teach you to expect them.</i>

242
00:12:38,987 --> 00:12:41,956
<i>Which is why Taub</i>
<i>is idiotic to study them,</i>

243
00:12:42,023 --> 00:12:44,057
<i>and you're idiotic to attach</i>
<i>any significance to them.</i>

244
00:12:44,125 --> 00:12:45,559
Blood clot.

245
00:12:45,626 --> 00:12:48,562
Her D-Dimer's normal.

246
00:12:48,630 --> 00:12:50,064
On the other hand--

247
00:12:51,966 --> 00:12:54,234
Yah!

248
00:12:56,304 --> 00:12:58,038
What if he's right
about the blockage

249
00:12:58,106 --> 00:12:59,473
but wrong
about the cause?

250
00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:01,408
<i>Vasospasm.</i>

251
00:13:01,476 --> 00:13:04,144
That explains everything
but the lymph nodes.

252
00:13:04,212 --> 00:13:05,846
And any minor infection
could have caused those.

253
00:13:05,914 --> 00:13:08,548
Calcium channel blocker
to treat.

254
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:21,060
Are you okay?

255
00:13:21,128 --> 00:13:22,762
I almost got you killed
by bringing a scalpel

256
00:13:22,830 --> 00:13:24,097
into that room.

257
00:13:24,165 --> 00:13:25,231
I could feel better
about that.

258
00:13:25,299 --> 00:13:27,367
You saved my life too.

259
00:13:27,434 --> 00:13:30,637
I think the ledger's clear.

260
00:13:30,704 --> 00:13:33,139
But how can you not
be traumatized?

261
00:13:33,207 --> 00:13:35,508
Can't change
what happened.

262
00:13:35,576 --> 00:13:38,244
Can only make better
choices from here.

263
00:13:38,312 --> 00:13:39,879
So you're Zen about it

264
00:13:39,947 --> 00:13:41,948
but won't let go
of your anger toward House?

265
00:13:45,652 --> 00:13:47,286
I'm seeing
a trauma counselor.

266
00:13:47,354 --> 00:13:48,788
I think you should too.

267
00:13:48,856 --> 00:13:51,091
I'm okay.

268
00:13:51,158 --> 00:13:53,059
Just knowing you're there
for me is enough.

269
00:14:01,904 --> 00:14:03,438
Convent lets you
have this?

270
00:14:03,506 --> 00:14:06,808
I borrowed it from
one of the nurses.

271
00:14:06,876 --> 00:14:08,777
I'm still on temporary vows.

272
00:14:08,845 --> 00:14:11,747
<i>It may be the last time</i>
<i>I hear Eminem for a while.</i>

273
00:14:11,814 --> 00:14:14,216
You're using an iPod.

274
00:14:14,283 --> 00:14:16,351
But I've never seen you
use rosary beads.

275
00:14:21,290 --> 00:14:23,791
What day did Jesus die?

276
00:14:23,859 --> 00:14:26,061
I know,
one gospel says passover,

277
00:14:26,128 --> 00:14:28,430
another says
the day before.

278
00:14:28,497 --> 00:14:29,564
How many times
did the cock crow

279
00:14:29,632 --> 00:14:31,633
before Peter's
third denial?

280
00:14:31,701 --> 00:14:32,934
Once or twice?

281
00:14:33,002 --> 00:14:35,570
You can't argue away
my faith.

282
00:14:35,638 --> 00:14:36,805
Why?

283
00:14:36,872 --> 00:14:38,206
Because it's so strong

284
00:14:38,274 --> 00:14:39,674
even plain contradictions--

285
00:14:39,742 --> 00:14:42,577
because it's not
that strong.

286
00:14:42,645 --> 00:14:44,879
I'm not saying
I don't have faith.

287
00:14:44,947 --> 00:14:49,150
I just haven't felt
the calling yet.

288
00:14:49,218 --> 00:14:52,153
No one joins the clergy
without having that epiphany.

289
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:54,955
That God's love
is speaking to you directly.

290
00:14:55,023 --> 00:14:58,892
It's the silence,
the contemplation,

291
00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:01,160
the order.

292
00:15:01,228 --> 00:15:02,595
I need them.

293
00:15:05,265 --> 00:15:08,000
Hoping everything else
will come later.

294
00:15:08,068 --> 00:15:10,336
That's not an answer.

295
00:15:10,404 --> 00:15:12,705
If you want silence,
you can get ear plugs.

296
00:15:12,773 --> 00:15:14,975
I tried the outside world.

297
00:15:15,042 --> 00:15:17,010
It wasn't enough.

298
00:15:17,078 --> 00:15:18,178
Have you been married?

299
00:15:18,246 --> 00:15:19,547
No.

300
00:15:19,614 --> 00:15:21,616
No kids.
You never found a career.

301
00:15:21,684 --> 00:15:24,052
Doesn't sound like the outside
world got much of a try.

302
00:15:26,155 --> 00:15:29,290
What you're
headed towards now,

303
00:15:29,357 --> 00:15:32,026
14 hours a day
in silent prayer,

304
00:15:32,094 --> 00:15:34,462
never having a family,

305
00:15:34,530 --> 00:15:36,965
never touching
another human being.

306
00:15:37,032 --> 00:15:39,000
Just because that's
what you'd miss the most.

307
00:15:40,969 --> 00:15:43,270
The nurses talk.

308
00:15:46,942 --> 00:15:48,642
Nothing's wrong
with having fun.

309
00:15:48,710 --> 00:15:51,912
They said you were almost
killed three weeks ago.

310
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:54,281
You go right back to fun?

311
00:15:54,349 --> 00:15:57,283
Is that why
you wanna be a nun?

312
00:15:57,351 --> 00:15:58,851
Someone broke your heart.

313
00:15:58,919 --> 00:16:03,388
No.

314
00:16:03,456 --> 00:16:06,825
I'm just looking
for something more.

315
00:16:09,228 --> 00:16:10,695
So am I.

316
00:16:21,374 --> 00:16:23,442
I'm late for work
in the clinic.

317
00:16:41,928 --> 00:16:43,362
Really?

318
00:16:43,430 --> 00:16:45,031
George Washingbaum?

319
00:16:45,098 --> 00:16:47,466
He was a character
in the Flintsteins.

320
00:16:47,534 --> 00:16:51,170
Just hiding out till House
leaves the cafeteria.

321
00:16:55,409 --> 00:16:57,043
The self-defense classes,

322
00:16:57,110 --> 00:16:59,379
you think they're making
any kind of difference?

323
00:16:59,446 --> 00:17:02,314
Not as much
as House's surprise attacks.

324
00:17:02,382 --> 00:17:04,550
He thinks three steps ahead,
so I do too.

325
00:17:06,419 --> 00:17:08,020
Which is why you should
accept his apology

326
00:17:08,088 --> 00:17:09,455
and come back on the team.

327
00:17:09,522 --> 00:17:11,824
<i>He's annoying,</i>
<i>he's maddening.</i>

328
00:17:11,892 --> 00:17:14,160
But he makes us
all better.

329
00:17:16,730 --> 00:17:18,865
Note to self.

330
00:17:22,035 --> 00:17:23,636
Foot color's good.

331
00:17:23,704 --> 00:17:27,073
Arterial pulse is good.

332
00:17:27,140 --> 00:17:28,808
Capillary refill's good.

333
00:17:28,875 --> 00:17:30,409
And her shoulder pain
is all gone.

334
00:17:30,477 --> 00:17:33,612
Looks like you're ready
to go home.

335
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:36,115
I'll get the car
and meet you out front.

336
00:17:39,353 --> 00:17:42,088
I'd say I'm in the book,

337
00:17:42,156 --> 00:17:44,525
but not the one you'll be
reading from now on.

338
00:17:52,299 --> 00:17:56,736
Six years ago,
I was a nanny in Honolulu

339
00:17:56,804 --> 00:17:59,372
<i>for this beautiful</i>
<i>two-year-old boy.</i>

340
00:17:59,439 --> 00:18:01,607
I loved him.

341
00:18:01,675 --> 00:18:03,543
Probably spent
more time with him

342
00:18:03,610 --> 00:18:05,712
<i>than his own parents.</i>

343
00:18:07,547 --> 00:18:12,284
One day I was in the park
talking with another nanny.

344
00:18:12,352 --> 00:18:16,688
He wandered out of the sandbox
into the street,

345
00:18:16,755 --> 00:18:19,957
into the path
of a moving car.

346
00:18:22,394 --> 00:18:24,028
That could have happened
to anyone.

347
00:18:24,096 --> 00:18:26,797
I don't think so.

348
00:18:26,865 --> 00:18:29,334
And even if it did,
they'd blame themselves

349
00:18:29,401 --> 00:18:31,602
for the rest
of their lives too.

350
00:18:31,670 --> 00:18:35,507
You shouldn't.

351
00:18:35,574 --> 00:18:38,676
You shouldn't run from what
can still be a good life.

352
00:18:38,744 --> 00:18:41,213
I'm running to God.

353
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:43,014
After what happened to you,

354
00:18:43,082 --> 00:18:45,250
don't you wanna
remake your life?

355
00:18:45,318 --> 00:18:48,420
Not by hiding myself away.

356
00:18:50,756 --> 00:18:53,191
I hope it works out
for you.

357
00:18:57,230 --> 00:19:00,632
It is gonna be hard.

358
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:02,868
Not touching anyone.

359
00:19:47,130 --> 00:19:51,233
Who knew mother inferior
was a smoking hottie.

360
00:19:51,289 --> 00:19:53,257
No wonder you're playing
handsies with her.

361
00:19:53,324 --> 00:19:55,292
You think I'm hitting
on a nun?

362
00:19:55,359 --> 00:19:58,127
Angry at God or I just
need a challenge?

363
00:19:58,195 --> 00:20:00,463
Or you're terrified
of intimacy,

364
00:20:00,531 --> 00:20:02,465
which is why
you're a serial slut.

365
00:20:02,533 --> 00:20:06,101
But right now you're grasping
at an emotional life raft.

366
00:20:06,169 --> 00:20:09,738
Ideally someone for whom
intimacy's not an option.

367
00:20:09,806 --> 00:20:11,673
That actually makes sense,
which I can't say

368
00:20:11,741 --> 00:20:12,907
about anything else
you've been doing.

369
00:20:12,975 --> 00:20:14,808
I'm not emotionally
involved with her.

370
00:20:14,876 --> 00:20:17,144
And much as I'd love
to hear you contradict me,

371
00:20:17,212 --> 00:20:19,881
I have a 7:30 appointment
to explore my intimacy issues

372
00:20:19,948 --> 00:20:22,283
at La Scala.

373
00:20:24,420 --> 00:20:25,887
I'm talking to this agent.
He's a bit of a sleaze.

374
00:20:25,955 --> 00:20:28,456
But he's really excited
about representing me.

375
00:20:28,524 --> 00:20:30,458
<i>Although he can't take on</i>
<i>any new clients right now,</i>

376
00:20:30,526 --> 00:20:31,793
<i>he's trying to get me</i>
<i>an audition</i>

377
00:20:31,861 --> 00:20:33,462
<i>for one of those</i>
<i>online soaps.</i>

378
00:20:33,529 --> 00:20:34,697
Have you ever watched
one of those?

379
00:20:38,335 --> 00:20:39,536
Am I boring you?

380
00:20:44,141 --> 00:20:46,409
Unfortunately, yeah.

381
00:20:46,476 --> 00:20:47,910
Sorry.

382
00:21:00,158 --> 00:21:01,559
Hi.

383
00:21:03,895 --> 00:21:06,931
You're not supposed
to be here.

384
00:21:06,998 --> 00:21:08,098
Or anywhere.

385
00:21:08,166 --> 00:21:10,167
Yeah.

386
00:21:12,470 --> 00:21:14,504
You were right.

387
00:21:14,572 --> 00:21:16,439
I was running away.

388
00:21:59,415 --> 00:22:01,617
Oh, now you're shy.

389
00:22:04,087 --> 00:22:07,022
It's brighter
in the morning.

390
00:22:12,929 --> 00:22:15,531
So are we gonna spend
the rest of eternity

391
00:22:15,598 --> 00:22:18,266
in a lake of fire
while pointy-tailed demons

392
00:22:18,334 --> 00:22:20,602
poke at us with sticks?

393
00:22:24,774 --> 00:22:26,742
This is a little scary
for me.

394
00:22:26,810 --> 00:22:29,144
I had a whole life planned.

395
00:22:29,212 --> 00:22:32,715
Not that I wasn't
struggling with it.

396
00:22:32,782 --> 00:22:34,450
And then I met you.

397
00:22:34,518 --> 00:22:38,888
Don't worry, I know you're
not the relationship type.

398
00:22:38,956 --> 00:22:40,924
I'm not
not the relationship type.

399
00:22:40,992 --> 00:22:42,526
I was married once.

400
00:22:42,593 --> 00:22:44,361
Relax.

401
00:22:44,429 --> 00:22:45,863
You're fine.

402
00:22:48,233 --> 00:22:49,668
So what's next for you?

403
00:22:52,739 --> 00:22:55,574
I have to find
a place to live.

404
00:22:55,642 --> 00:22:58,344
Get my old job back.

405
00:22:58,412 --> 00:23:01,714
Sure, I'll feel guilty,
start doubting.

406
00:23:01,782 --> 00:23:03,515
As long as you keep dealing
with your doubts

407
00:23:03,583 --> 00:23:05,417
in the same way then...

408
00:23:07,688 --> 00:23:09,888
Moira?

409
00:23:09,956 --> 00:23:12,191
I'm sorry,
did you say something?

410
00:23:14,227 --> 00:23:16,028
Your neck.

411
00:23:16,095 --> 00:23:17,529
What?

412
00:23:17,597 --> 00:23:19,131
Are your ears ringing?

413
00:23:19,199 --> 00:23:22,868
Yeah.
What does that mean?

414
00:23:24,938 --> 00:23:29,240
We've got to get you back
to the hospital right away.

415
00:23:29,308 --> 00:23:30,475
The artery that's bringing
blood to your brain,

416
00:23:30,543 --> 00:23:31,709
it's coming apart.

417
00:23:31,777 --> 00:23:33,210
Means you could stroke.

418
00:23:33,278 --> 00:23:34,812
I've paged a team
of our best doctors.

419
00:23:34,879 --> 00:23:36,613
I don't have
to cough as much.

420
00:23:36,681 --> 00:23:38,883
It's clotted up.

421
00:23:38,950 --> 00:23:40,451
Is that bad?

422
00:23:40,518 --> 00:23:43,254
We're almost there.

423
00:23:44,656 --> 00:23:47,992
<i>Get me her o-two level.</i>

424
00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:49,360
What are you doing?

425
00:23:49,428 --> 00:23:51,128
I want to make sure I can
position her wrist properly.

426
00:23:51,196 --> 00:23:52,730
For what?
A.B.G.

427
00:23:52,798 --> 00:23:55,800
I don't need an A.B.G.
Just get a pulse ox.

428
00:23:55,868 --> 00:23:57,702
I'll do it.
Grab a consent form.

429
00:23:57,770 --> 00:24:00,171
Go!

430
00:24:00,239 --> 00:24:01,840
We need to operate
right now, okay?

431
00:24:01,908 --> 00:24:03,274
Good to operate.

432
00:24:05,445 --> 00:24:08,213
Repeat this, no ifs, ands,
or buts about it.

433
00:24:08,281 --> 00:24:11,249
No about it and no ifs.

434
00:24:11,317 --> 00:24:12,751
Get her into O.R. 11.

435
00:24:19,014 --> 00:24:20,147
Carotid dissection,

436
00:24:20,215 --> 00:24:22,049
four-inch pulsatile
mass in her neck,

437
00:24:22,116 --> 00:24:23,517
<i>and some broca's aphasia.</i>

438
00:24:23,584 --> 00:24:24,651
<i>It's got to be a clot</i>

439
00:24:24,719 --> 00:24:25,585
keeping her
from bleeding out.

440
00:24:25,653 --> 00:24:27,020
Pulse?

441
00:24:27,088 --> 00:24:28,155
Bounding, four-plus.

442
00:24:28,223 --> 00:24:29,156
It was a three-plus
20 minutes ago.

443
00:24:29,224 --> 00:24:31,325
20?

444
00:24:31,393 --> 00:24:32,927
Thought she just got here.

445
00:24:35,664 --> 00:24:37,466
That blood
looks pretty dry.

446
00:24:37,533 --> 00:24:40,002
Cut yourself shaving?

447
00:24:40,070 --> 00:24:42,271
You know,
that can happen

448
00:24:42,339 --> 00:24:45,342
when the nun you woke up with
coughs blood on you.

449
00:24:45,409 --> 00:24:47,911
You slept with a nun?

450
00:24:47,979 --> 00:24:49,946
Forget nun,
you slept with a patient?

451
00:24:50,014 --> 00:24:51,748
Former, to both.

452
00:24:51,816 --> 00:24:54,083
<i>Internal neck trauma,</i>
<i>that's impressive.</i>

453
00:24:54,150 --> 00:24:55,951
It's happened to me
a few times.

454
00:24:56,019 --> 00:24:58,487
Up high.

455
00:24:58,555 --> 00:25:00,388
Dr. Chase.

456
00:25:02,058 --> 00:25:04,292
<i>Clot's broken.</i>

457
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:05,527
Bring her in
and pack her nose.

458
00:25:05,594 --> 00:25:06,828
I'm gonna need
number three vicryls.

459
00:25:06,895 --> 00:25:09,163
I'm gonna fix this.

460
00:25:09,231 --> 00:25:10,198
You're not gonna
operate on her.

461
00:25:10,265 --> 00:25:11,933
Kapur and Carlyle
are unavailable.

462
00:25:12,001 --> 00:25:14,102
Reilly's done far fewer
dissections than I have.

463
00:25:14,169 --> 00:25:16,171
He's also slept with her
far fewer times than you have.

464
00:25:16,238 --> 00:25:17,505
Your judgment's
compromised.

465
00:25:17,573 --> 00:25:18,773
I spent the night with her.

466
00:25:18,841 --> 00:25:20,241
Doesn't change
how I make an incision.

467
00:25:20,309 --> 00:25:22,443
Tell him!

468
00:25:23,779 --> 00:25:26,915
Do the surgery.

469
00:25:26,983 --> 00:25:28,217
You're trying
to score points with him

470
00:25:28,285 --> 00:25:30,419
at the risk
of a patient's life.

471
00:25:30,487 --> 00:25:31,721
He's the better surgeon.

472
00:25:34,558 --> 00:25:35,692
Vascular clamp.

473
00:25:35,759 --> 00:25:37,560
You're not gonna put her
on bypass?

474
00:25:37,628 --> 00:25:38,761
It'd take a half hour
to set up.

475
00:25:38,829 --> 00:25:40,296
You clamp now,
she could stroke out.

476
00:25:40,364 --> 00:25:42,331
She's already got
neurological symptoms.

477
00:25:42,399 --> 00:25:44,667
We wait 30 minutes, she'll
definitely have brain damage.

478
00:25:44,735 --> 00:25:47,036
You're trying to make sure
she's either perfect or dead.

479
00:25:47,104 --> 00:25:48,304
She's not going to die.

480
00:25:48,372 --> 00:25:49,706
If I get this done
in five minutes,

481
00:25:49,774 --> 00:25:51,007
she won't stroke out.

482
00:25:51,075 --> 00:25:52,175
You don't know
that you will.

483
00:25:52,243 --> 00:25:53,476
And you can't know
because you can't

484
00:25:53,544 --> 00:25:56,279
think clearly about her.

485
00:25:56,347 --> 00:25:58,448
Vascular clamp.

486
00:26:05,223 --> 00:26:09,125
Occlusion time 9:46
and 23 seconds.

487
00:26:09,193 --> 00:26:11,194
Vascular scissors.

488
00:26:46,164 --> 00:26:48,799
We're over five minutes.

489
00:26:49,967 --> 00:26:52,002
Ultrasound.

490
00:26:58,074 --> 00:27:00,742
Good flow.
Lighten the anesthesia.

491
00:27:00,810 --> 00:27:02,777
You're not gonna close
the wound first?

492
00:27:02,845 --> 00:27:05,413
No.

493
00:27:18,362 --> 00:27:20,063
Can you hear me?

494
00:27:23,235 --> 00:27:24,969
Repeat this,

495
00:27:25,037 --> 00:27:27,972
no ifs, ands, or buts.

496
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:32,109
No ifs, ands, or buts.

497
00:27:38,484 --> 00:27:42,821
I'm sorry about before.

498
00:27:42,889 --> 00:27:45,557
You're scared,
aren't you?

499
00:27:45,625 --> 00:27:47,226
That's why you wanted
companionship.

500
00:27:47,294 --> 00:27:49,461
That's why you cried out
when House shot at Taub.

501
00:27:49,529 --> 00:27:51,530
What exactly
are you scared of?

502
00:27:51,598 --> 00:27:53,299
A needle stick?

503
00:27:53,367 --> 00:27:55,334
Some other nut
pulling a scalpel?

504
00:27:55,402 --> 00:27:58,937
I'm scared
of everything.

505
00:27:59,005 --> 00:28:01,106
It sucks that
there was a stabbing.

506
00:28:01,174 --> 00:28:02,674
But you'll get over it.

507
00:28:02,742 --> 00:28:04,143
Like you have?

508
00:28:04,211 --> 00:28:06,679
You weren't even there.

509
00:28:06,746 --> 00:28:09,382
I know, I--
I left the room.

510
00:28:09,449 --> 00:28:10,783
It was pure luck.

511
00:28:10,851 --> 00:28:13,886
I was in the room.
That was pure luck too.

512
00:28:17,257 --> 00:28:19,592
I get that you're scared
and guilty.

513
00:28:19,660 --> 00:28:21,227
You're still a doctor.

514
00:28:21,295 --> 00:28:23,429
I don't have time
to teach you to act like one.

515
00:28:28,668 --> 00:28:30,002
We removed the artery.

516
00:28:30,070 --> 00:28:31,204
I found nodules.

517
00:28:31,271 --> 00:28:32,906
Could mean lupus.

518
00:28:32,973 --> 00:28:34,006
Negative A.N.A.

519
00:28:34,074 --> 00:28:36,376
Where are you going?

520
00:28:36,443 --> 00:28:38,544
Great thing
about assigning Taub

521
00:28:38,611 --> 00:28:40,580
fraudulent lab work
is you know exactly

522
00:28:40,648 --> 00:28:42,548
where he's gonna
end up.

523
00:28:42,615 --> 00:28:44,250
Great thing about
assigning Taub

524
00:28:44,318 --> 00:28:46,285
obviously fraudulent
lab work

525
00:28:46,353 --> 00:28:48,821
is you get to watch
his inner paranoiac at work.

526
00:28:56,630 --> 00:28:59,566
And then...

527
00:28:59,633 --> 00:29:01,635
Two to the head.

528
00:29:01,702 --> 00:29:02,969
Can we talk
about my patient?

529
00:29:03,037 --> 00:29:04,571
Quite a journey.

530
00:29:04,639 --> 00:29:06,706
Starts with a surgical tool
in your heart

531
00:29:06,774 --> 00:29:08,274
and ends with
a surgeon's tool in a nun.

532
00:29:08,342 --> 00:29:09,442
What's the plan?

533
00:29:09,510 --> 00:29:11,111
Plan's to cure her.

534
00:29:11,178 --> 00:29:14,081
Well, if it's
not meaningless sex,

535
00:29:14,149 --> 00:29:15,849
kinda screams out
for an end game.

536
00:29:15,917 --> 00:29:18,118
You're the dog that's
chasing the popemobile.

537
00:29:18,185 --> 00:29:19,719
You sure you want--

538
00:29:21,555 --> 00:29:22,688
oh, my God.

539
00:29:25,592 --> 00:29:27,860
Taub is interrogating
the janitor.

540
00:29:27,927 --> 00:29:31,163
He must think that
I hired him to attack--

541
00:29:31,230 --> 00:29:35,200
actually,
why didn't I do that?

542
00:29:35,268 --> 00:29:38,571
Plaques could be confused
for nodules.

543
00:29:38,638 --> 00:29:40,572
Which would mean...
Syphilis.

544
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:43,008
Explains the shoulder
and foot involvement.

545
00:29:43,076 --> 00:29:44,910
<i>Hope you practiced</i>

546
00:29:44,977 --> 00:29:46,578
the immaculate
contraception.

547
00:29:51,718 --> 00:29:53,552
Lock and load.

548
00:29:55,855 --> 00:29:57,489
Boo-yah!

549
00:29:57,556 --> 00:29:59,657
Pfft!

550
00:29:59,725 --> 00:30:01,993
Boo-yah to you too.

551
00:30:05,497 --> 00:30:07,899
But I hadn't
had sex in years.

552
00:30:07,967 --> 00:30:09,301
Tertiary syphilis means
you've had the disease

553
00:30:09,368 --> 00:30:10,835
for at least that long.

554
00:30:10,903 --> 00:30:13,372
Does that mean
you also have it?

555
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:15,675
Probably not contagious
at this point.

556
00:30:19,713 --> 00:30:21,515
Can it cause
hallucinations?

557
00:30:21,583 --> 00:30:23,584
It's unlikely. Why?

558
00:30:26,422 --> 00:30:28,589
While I was
on the operating table,

559
00:30:28,657 --> 00:30:31,192
it didn't feel
like a dream.

560
00:30:31,260 --> 00:30:36,396
I saw the boy
who I was caring for.

561
00:30:36,464 --> 00:30:40,166
The one who died.

562
00:30:40,234 --> 00:30:43,236
He walked right up to me.

563
00:30:43,303 --> 00:30:45,204
What did he say?

564
00:30:45,272 --> 00:30:48,474
He just held my hand.

565
00:30:48,542 --> 00:30:52,311
It was like
he forgave me.

566
00:30:52,379 --> 00:30:54,113
Do you think
that's crazy?

567
00:30:56,117 --> 00:30:59,319
I think it should
give you solace,

568
00:30:59,387 --> 00:31:03,424
help you to move on.

569
00:31:08,631 --> 00:31:10,632
You slept
with your patient?

570
00:31:13,969 --> 00:31:15,836
You're off the case.

571
00:31:15,904 --> 00:31:18,204
I saved her
from brain damage.

572
00:31:18,272 --> 00:31:20,273
You think my judgment's
the least bit compromised?

573
00:31:20,341 --> 00:31:21,841
She's still sick.

574
00:31:21,908 --> 00:31:23,342
If she dies,
we'll be in the middle

575
00:31:23,410 --> 00:31:25,144
of a brand-new
investigation.

576
00:31:25,211 --> 00:31:26,745
This is about you
covering your own ass.

577
00:31:26,813 --> 00:31:29,181
I gave you time, leeway,

578
00:31:29,249 --> 00:31:31,784
and you decided to do
whatever the hell you wanted.

579
00:31:31,851 --> 00:31:33,252
House can dance
all over the rules,

580
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:35,354
gets me knifed,
and he gets a pass.

581
00:31:35,422 --> 00:31:37,189
I break a rule,
no one gets hurt,

582
00:31:37,257 --> 00:31:39,024
but you kick me off
my own case?

583
00:31:39,092 --> 00:31:41,527
Unfortunately, yes.

584
00:31:46,633 --> 00:31:48,000
I'm sorry.

585
00:31:48,068 --> 00:31:49,602
I took that scalpel
for you.

586
00:31:49,669 --> 00:31:51,370
That's why I did this.

587
00:31:51,437 --> 00:31:53,205
Three weeks ago,

588
00:31:53,273 --> 00:31:55,274
you never would have
slept with a patient.

589
00:31:55,341 --> 00:31:57,776
And you never would have
operated on her after.

590
00:31:59,512 --> 00:32:01,079
You need help.

591
00:32:01,147 --> 00:32:02,781
I need to get away
from House

592
00:32:02,848 --> 00:32:04,582
and everything
that reminds me of him.

593
00:32:04,650 --> 00:32:05,950
By breaking the rules,

594
00:32:06,018 --> 00:32:08,219
not caring what
anyone else thinks.

595
00:32:08,287 --> 00:32:11,689
You're gonna get away from him
by turning into him?

596
00:32:18,799 --> 00:32:20,800
It hurts.

597
00:32:31,479 --> 00:32:33,647
Right upper quadrant,
pain and distension.

598
00:32:33,715 --> 00:32:36,683
What's wrong
with my stomach?

599
00:32:36,751 --> 00:32:37,518
<i>Nothing.</i>

600
00:32:37,586 --> 00:32:40,087
This is your liver.

601
00:32:43,846 --> 00:32:45,046
The liver failure could be

602
00:32:45,081 --> 00:32:47,531
from intraoperative
hypotension.

603
00:32:47,536 --> 00:32:48,754
Checked the anesthesia sheet,

604
00:32:48,755 --> 00:32:49,921
pressure was fine
throughout.

605
00:32:49,989 --> 00:32:50,625
Thrombus?

606
00:32:50,626 --> 00:32:52,808
That voice in the hall
that none of us

607
00:32:52,809 --> 00:32:54,009
have any reason
to be listening to

608
00:32:54,077 --> 00:32:57,579
is not surprisingly wrong.

609
00:32:57,647 --> 00:32:59,248
Abdominal ultrasound
was negative.

610
00:32:59,316 --> 00:33:00,548
Then we have to assume
liver failure

611
00:33:00,616 --> 00:33:03,751
is just another symptom
of whatever she's got.

612
00:33:03,819 --> 00:33:05,219
<i>Trousseau's syndrome</i>
<i>could send clots,</i>

613
00:33:05,287 --> 00:33:06,687
cause the ischemic foot.

614
00:33:06,755 --> 00:33:08,689
Add the enlarged lymph node,
macrocytosis.

615
00:33:08,757 --> 00:33:11,558
Disseminated
T-cell lymphoma.

616
00:33:11,626 --> 00:33:13,293
Wilson said
it wasn't cancer.

617
00:33:13,361 --> 00:33:16,096
Wilson says
it's not breast cancer.

618
00:33:16,164 --> 00:33:17,731
Sarcoidosis.

619
00:33:17,799 --> 00:33:18,866
Normal ACE level.

620
00:33:18,933 --> 00:33:20,334
Highly insensitive
for sarcoid.

621
00:33:20,402 --> 00:33:22,136
Negative chest X-rays aren't.

622
00:33:22,203 --> 00:33:23,504
Then we've got
to biopsy.

623
00:33:23,572 --> 00:33:25,640
Yeah, Foreman's
clearly wrong.

624
00:33:25,708 --> 00:33:27,943
You're clearly
not grasping at straws

625
00:33:28,010 --> 00:33:30,379
'cause you're clearly
not emotionally involved.

626
00:33:30,447 --> 00:33:33,516
I know you want to believe that
this is something we can cure.

627
00:33:33,584 --> 00:33:35,318
It's not.

628
00:33:35,386 --> 00:33:36,686
I'm sorry.

629
00:33:48,433 --> 00:33:50,867
How soon will they know
if it's cancer?

630
00:33:50,935 --> 00:33:52,836
Within hours.

631
00:33:52,904 --> 00:33:55,238
And if it is?

632
00:33:57,335 --> 00:33:58,860
There's always chemo.

633
00:33:59,855 --> 00:34:02,957
You say that like
it's not gonna work.

634
00:34:03,025 --> 00:34:05,454
Could extend your life.

635
00:34:05,456 --> 00:34:06,523
Years?

636
00:34:12,730 --> 00:34:14,464
I'll be here
as much as you need.

637
00:34:18,092 --> 00:34:21,327
You still never told me
why you left the seminary.

638
00:34:24,598 --> 00:34:26,399
Mary Knoller.

639
00:34:26,466 --> 00:34:29,869
Wife of the groundskeeper.

640
00:34:29,937 --> 00:34:33,106
He caught me with her,
got me with a rake.

641
00:34:33,173 --> 00:34:35,708
Those scars on my ass
you may have noticed.

642
00:34:37,211 --> 00:34:40,047
Why didn't you
tell me that before?

643
00:34:40,114 --> 00:34:41,882
Because it was so shallow.

644
00:34:41,950 --> 00:34:43,417
I wasn't exactly wrestling

645
00:34:43,484 --> 00:34:45,519
with great
theological questions.

646
00:34:45,587 --> 00:34:47,955
I don't believe that.

647
00:34:48,023 --> 00:34:50,358
You don't sleep with
the groundskeeper's wife,

648
00:34:50,426 --> 00:34:53,596
not unless you're struggling
with whether you belong there.

649
00:34:57,401 --> 00:35:00,169
I always wanted to believe.

650
00:35:00,237 --> 00:35:03,539
Would have made
my life a lot easier.

651
00:35:03,607 --> 00:35:05,775
It never took.

652
00:35:05,843 --> 00:35:08,444
Doesn't...

653
00:35:08,512 --> 00:35:11,014
Mean...

654
00:35:11,081 --> 00:35:12,749
It's too late.

655
00:35:12,816 --> 00:35:14,918
Are you having trouble talking,
like before?

656
00:35:17,254 --> 00:35:19,656
I can get the words out.

657
00:35:19,723 --> 00:35:21,825
Just feels heavy
when I do.

658
00:35:21,892 --> 00:35:23,293
Where?

659
00:35:23,361 --> 00:35:27,097
Wherever my
chewing muscles are.

660
00:35:27,164 --> 00:35:28,998
I'll be right back.

661
00:35:34,806 --> 00:35:36,439
House finally got you.

662
00:35:36,507 --> 00:35:38,174
He tried but--
I gotta go.

663
00:35:38,242 --> 00:35:40,343
You shoulda seen it.
It was perfect.

664
00:35:45,616 --> 00:35:48,051
She has jaw claudication.

665
00:35:48,119 --> 00:35:49,920
If you only heard claudication
and carotid dissection...

666
00:35:49,988 --> 00:35:53,924
I'd say
giant cell arteritis.

667
00:35:53,992 --> 00:35:55,359
And I'd tell
your former teammates

668
00:35:55,426 --> 00:35:56,826
to put her
on steroids.

669
00:35:56,894 --> 00:35:58,728
She's gonna live.

670
00:35:58,796 --> 00:36:01,264
Yeah.

671
00:36:01,332 --> 00:36:02,665
And then what?

672
00:36:09,072 --> 00:36:10,973
They say my liver
function's better.

673
00:36:11,041 --> 00:36:12,642
That I can get out
of here soon.

674
00:36:12,710 --> 00:36:14,877
And when you do,

675
00:36:14,945 --> 00:36:16,813
I'm gonna take you
to puerto escondido.

676
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:18,915
Mexico?

677
00:36:18,983 --> 00:36:20,316
The Mexican pipeline.

678
00:36:20,384 --> 00:36:25,255
Early May is when the surf
really picks up but--

679
00:36:25,322 --> 00:36:27,324
what's wrong?

680
00:36:27,391 --> 00:36:31,160
I spoke to the prioress.

681
00:36:31,228 --> 00:36:33,129
You're going back?

682
00:36:33,197 --> 00:36:35,531
I felt the calling.

683
00:36:35,599 --> 00:36:37,632
When you saw the boy.

684
00:36:37,700 --> 00:36:40,802
I felt God's love,
his Grace.

685
00:36:40,870 --> 00:36:43,205
I've been waiting
my entire life for that.

686
00:36:43,272 --> 00:36:44,606
It's not real.

687
00:36:44,674 --> 00:36:46,608
I know you didn't feel anything
when you almost died.

688
00:36:46,676 --> 00:36:47,910
I did.

689
00:36:47,977 --> 00:36:49,845
You felt oxygen
depravation.

690
00:36:49,913 --> 00:36:52,414
You felt your brain
releasing noradrenaline.

691
00:36:52,482 --> 00:36:54,383
You didn't say that before.

692
00:36:54,451 --> 00:36:57,354
I wanted you to move on
with your life.

693
00:36:57,422 --> 00:36:59,056
I wanted to reassure you.

694
00:36:59,123 --> 00:37:00,825
I wanted you
to feel better.

695
00:37:00,892 --> 00:37:03,861
And now you don't?

696
00:37:03,929 --> 00:37:06,897
Now...

697
00:37:06,965 --> 00:37:08,332
I think I love you.

698
00:37:18,701 --> 00:37:21,670
"Noradrenaline and
near-death experiences."

699
00:37:21,737 --> 00:37:23,733
Oh, dear.

700
00:37:24,236 --> 00:37:25,661
You saw God?

701
00:37:25,686 --> 00:37:26,729
She did.

702
00:37:26,754 --> 00:37:28,522
She wants to go back
to the monastery.

703
00:37:29,473 --> 00:37:32,122
So now you're preparing
a Powerpoint presentation

704
00:37:32,123 --> 00:37:34,516
to keep her in your garden
of earthly delights.

705
00:37:35,225 --> 00:37:36,425
You're an idiot.

706
00:37:37,614 --> 00:37:39,629
Because I found someone I love?

707
00:37:39,641 --> 00:37:40,700
Because you're an idiot.

708
00:37:40,701 --> 00:37:43,657
At least you two
have that in common.

709
00:37:43,658 --> 00:37:45,674
Her feelings are based
on a chemical process.

710
00:37:45,675 --> 00:37:46,662
They're gonna wear off.

711
00:37:46,663 --> 00:37:48,665
You just slept with her.

712
00:37:48,666 --> 00:37:50,682
Your brain is exploding
with oxytocin.

713
00:37:50,683 --> 00:37:52,664
You think that's gonna
last through the ages?

714
00:37:52,665 --> 00:37:53,673
She's throwing away her life

715
00:37:53,674 --> 00:37:54,700
because of blind faith.

716
00:37:54,701 --> 00:37:56,636
So are you!

717
00:37:56,637 --> 00:37:57,716
She's found something

718
00:37:57,717 --> 00:37:59,716
she wants to build
her life around.

719
00:37:59,717 --> 00:38:02,640
It's a total illusion,
but apparently she'll take

720
00:38:02,641 --> 00:38:03,683
a little ignorance
with her bliss.

721
00:38:03,684 --> 00:38:05,661
And you want to take that away?

722
00:38:05,662 --> 00:38:06,677
How many times have
you thrown the truth

723
00:38:06,678 --> 00:38:07,712
in people's faces?

724
00:38:07,713 --> 00:38:09,636
Because it's the truth,

725
00:38:09,637 --> 00:38:12,670
not because we're gonna
live happily ever after.

726
00:38:12,671 --> 00:38:15,670
Either your relationship
just blows up

727
00:38:15,671 --> 00:38:18,632
like every other
non-magical romance,

728
00:38:18,633 --> 00:38:19,679
or she stays with you
but blames you

729
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:22,665
for stripping all the meaning
out of her life.

730
00:38:22,666 --> 00:38:25,632
This has nothing to do
with the truth.

731
00:38:25,633 --> 00:38:27,674
You don't like that
I'm reassessing my life,

732
00:38:27,675 --> 00:38:29,682
that I want to change it,

733
00:38:29,683 --> 00:38:30,707
that I can.

734
00:38:30,708 --> 00:38:32,649
Anyone can screw up a life.

735
00:38:32,650 --> 00:38:33,698
I never said
that wasn't possible.

736
00:38:33,699 --> 00:38:35,695
You're incapable
of human connection,

737
00:38:35,696 --> 00:38:38,724
so you want everyone
to be like you.

738
00:38:38,725 --> 00:38:41,671
If I wanted you
to be like me...

739
00:38:45,671 --> 00:38:47,686
I would be urging you

740
00:38:47,687 --> 00:38:49,679
to make a stupid,
stubborn decision

741
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:52,716
that blows up your life and
leaves you lonely and miserable.

742
00:38:59,654 --> 00:39:02,678
You reassess your life
when you've made mistakes.

743
00:39:02,679 --> 00:39:05,658
You didn't.
You just got stabbed.

744
00:40:04,721 --> 00:40:07,653
Don't look at the book.

745
00:40:07,654 --> 00:40:09,704
I haven't done a jugular line
since my residency.

746
00:40:09,705 --> 00:40:11,729
I don't want to needle
the carotid.

747
00:40:15,675 --> 00:40:16,700
What's the first step?

748
00:40:16,701 --> 00:40:19,699
Palpate the S.C.M.

749
00:40:19,700 --> 00:40:20,711
Where?

750
00:40:20,712 --> 00:40:23,704
Middle third of the neck.

751
00:40:54,687 --> 00:40:56,670
I'm happy I knew you.

752
00:40:56,671 --> 00:40:59,687
So am I.

753
00:41:16,633 --> 00:41:17,691
Robert.

754
00:42:14,683 --> 00:42:16,670
24-year-oldwater treatment worker

755
00:42:16,671 --> 00:42:18,675
with pyrexia and double vision.

756
00:42:39,662 --> 00:42:42,636
Abscess?

757
00:42:42,637 --> 00:42:44,670
Would have seen it on the MRI.

758
00:42:44,671 --> 00:42:47,665
Diphtheria paralyzing
the ocular muscles?

759
00:42:47,666 --> 00:42:48,675
No, paralysis was first.

760
00:42:48,676 --> 00:42:50,654
- Aneurysm?
- Not with this fever.

761
00:42:50,657 --> 00:42:52,674
Maybe we're thinking about
this the wrong way.

762
00:42:52,675 --> 00:42:53,712
Retro-ocular infection?

763
00:42:53,713 --> 00:42:55,654
With no local symptoms?

764
00:42:55,679 --> 00:42:59,679
