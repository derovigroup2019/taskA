1
00:00:01,051 --> 00:00:03,747
Telling you, Will,
you got a real winner here.

2
00:00:04,125 --> 00:00:06,568
She's just gonna love it.

3
00:00:08,864 --> 00:00:11,604
Stacy, box her up.

4
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:14,080
Oh. Just the box.

5
00:00:14,902 --> 00:00:18,605
I'm sure it's prettier
than the paper.

6
00:00:20,851 --> 00:00:22,886
One tiny rock.

7
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:24,921
So many other cool things I
could have bought for myself.

8
00:00:24,955 --> 00:00:29,724
Sam, Stacy, it's been a pleasure
being ripped off by you.

9
00:00:41,037 --> 00:00:42,337
<i>Such a nice boy.</i>

10
00:00:42,372 --> 00:00:45,773
Too bad he's a handicap.

11
00:00:59,587 --> 00:01:02,956
Excuse me.

12
00:01:02,990 --> 00:01:06,426
Thank you.

13
00:01:44,129 --> 00:01:46,464
You all right, man?
Take it easy, man!

14
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,168
It's okay. It's okay.

[Massive Attack's <i>Teardrop]</i>

17
00:02:03,689 --> 00:02:25,946
?

18
00:02:27,269 --> 00:02:29,170
Kid's a blind diabetic.

19
00:02:29,205 --> 00:02:31,806
He's hyperglycemic
hyperosmolar.

20
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,741
Which is what we thought until
his blood tests showed

21
00:02:33,775 --> 00:02:35,643
a controlled sugar level
and no ketones.

22
00:02:35,677 --> 00:02:37,344
It could be caused by
drug abuse.

23
00:02:37,379 --> 00:02:39,146
His tox screens were clean.

24
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:41,615
<i>You lying sack of crap.</i>

25
00:02:41,649 --> 00:02:43,150
I have them right
in front of me.

26
00:02:43,184 --> 00:02:44,784
Not you.

27
00:02:44,819 --> 00:02:46,786
This time.

28
00:02:46,821 --> 00:02:48,622
My former BFF.

29
00:02:48,656 --> 00:02:51,858
He's S-M-I-T-B-A-W-A.

30
00:02:51,893 --> 00:02:54,860
<i>Stabbing me in</i>
<i>the back as we speak.</i>

31
00:02:54,895 --> 00:02:56,262
Where exactly are you?

32
00:02:56,296 --> 00:02:57,530
<i>If anyone should happen to ask,</i>

33
00:02:57,564 --> 00:02:58,998
I'm in an out-of-state

34
00:02:59,033 --> 00:03:00,633
medical conference
until further notice.

35
00:03:00,667 --> 00:03:01,634
Why would any--

36
00:03:01,668 --> 00:03:02,935
and...Don't really care.

37
00:03:02,969 --> 00:03:04,537
Auditory hallucinations

38
00:03:04,571 --> 00:03:06,705
<i>and disorientation could be</i>
<i>signs of schizophrenia.</i>

39
00:03:06,740 --> 00:03:07,706
<i>They did a psych consult.</i>

40
00:03:07,741 --> 00:03:09,041
<i>Mental status is normal.</i>

41
00:03:09,075 --> 00:03:11,544
Seizure,
noise-induced epilepsy--

42
00:03:11,578 --> 00:03:13,913
the sound of <i>rush hour traffic</i>
<i>could have set it off.</i>

43
00:03:13,947 --> 00:03:15,380
Run an E.E.G.

44
00:03:15,415 --> 00:03:17,482
Blast his brain with harmonics
to find out.

45
00:03:17,517 --> 00:03:20,586
<i>Also, if anyone should further</i>
<i>happen to ask,</i>

46
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:22,688
I spent the whole last year
in Africa

47
00:03:22,722 --> 00:03:25,089
<i>with Doctors Without</i>
<i>Boundaries.</i>

48
00:03:25,123 --> 00:03:27,825
Who are you hiding from?

49
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:30,394
Evil.

50
00:03:36,101 --> 00:03:38,202
Where's House?

51
00:03:38,236 --> 00:03:41,538
Uh, he's at an out-of-state
medical conference.

52
00:03:41,573 --> 00:03:43,006
In Baltimore.

53
00:03:43,041 --> 00:03:47,044
I think.

54
00:03:47,078 --> 00:03:48,645
Nice to meet you.

55
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:50,513
I'm Blythe, his mother.

56
00:04:00,757 --> 00:04:02,491
Do you want me to pick up
the braille writer

57
00:04:02,525 --> 00:04:04,060
and laptop
from your apartment?

58
00:04:04,094 --> 00:04:05,895
I don't plan on being here
that long.

59
00:04:05,929 --> 00:04:07,162
I didn't eat lunch yesterday.

60
00:04:07,197 --> 00:04:09,031
I probably just fainted.

61
00:04:09,066 --> 00:04:10,633
<i>Or had an epileptic seizure.</i>

62
00:04:10,667 --> 00:04:13,501
Which is
only one possibility.

63
00:04:13,535 --> 00:04:14,936
I'm Doctor Chase.

64
00:04:14,971 --> 00:04:17,171
Uh, we'd like to discuss your
case with you privately.

65
00:04:17,206 --> 00:04:18,773
<i>I'm his girlfriend.</i>
<i>Is it all right</i>

66
00:04:18,808 --> 00:04:20,775
if I stay for this?
Melissa can stay.

67
00:04:20,810 --> 00:04:22,811
And I've never had a seizure
before in my life.

68
00:04:22,845 --> 00:04:23,812
They can be mild.

69
00:04:23,846 --> 00:04:24,980
Like a loss of concentration

70
00:04:25,014 --> 00:04:26,414
or a muscle tremor.

71
00:04:26,448 --> 00:04:30,183
A lot of times a family member
notices before the patient does.

72
00:04:30,218 --> 00:04:31,885
I'm Doctor Park, by the way.

73
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:35,455
I'm 5'2", Asian,
and I'm totally cool with it

74
00:04:35,490 --> 00:04:37,124
if you wanna feel my face.

75
00:04:37,158 --> 00:04:39,559
Blind people only
do that in movies.

76
00:04:39,594 --> 00:04:42,462
But you sound nice,
so if you want me to...

77
00:04:42,497 --> 00:04:45,632
Her point was,
you may not have realized

78
00:04:45,657 --> 00:04:48,016
you were having a seizure, that
maybe your girlfriend has?

79
00:04:48,035 --> 00:04:49,401
No.

80
00:04:49,436 --> 00:04:53,472
But I--I haven't seen him
for the last five months.

81
00:04:53,507 --> 00:04:55,608
We were on a break.

82
00:04:55,643 --> 00:04:57,777
Like Rachel
and Ross on <i>Friends.</i>

83
00:04:57,811 --> 00:05:03,148
Never seen the show myself,
but I hear it's good.

84
00:05:03,182 --> 00:05:05,984
That joke usually kills
my blind friends.

85
00:05:06,019 --> 00:05:07,119
Will, this is serious.

86
00:05:07,153 --> 00:05:08,120
No, it's not.

87
00:05:08,154 --> 00:05:09,888
Since I don't have epilepsy.

88
00:05:09,922 --> 00:05:11,356
I have to pay attention
to every signal

89
00:05:11,390 --> 00:05:12,924
<i>my body sends or receives.</i>

90
00:05:12,959 --> 00:05:14,893
Or I end up taking a dirt nap.

91
00:05:14,927 --> 00:05:17,028
You don't think I'd know
if I was having seizures?

92
00:05:17,062 --> 00:05:18,629
<i>It's probably just</i>
<i>low blood sugar.</i>

93
00:05:18,664 --> 00:05:19,864
If that's true,
then you shouldn't have

94
00:05:19,898 --> 00:05:23,600
a problem passing our test.

95
00:05:23,635 --> 00:05:27,204
How is he, James, really?

96
00:05:27,238 --> 00:05:29,506
He's better than I've seen him
in a long time.

97
00:05:29,541 --> 00:05:31,208
Is he happy?

98
00:05:31,242 --> 00:05:33,710
Uh...

99
00:05:33,778 --> 00:05:35,011
<i>It's okay.</i>

100
00:05:35,046 --> 00:05:38,848
He's always been
a complicated child.

101
00:05:38,883 --> 00:05:41,985
Were you in
the hospital recently?

102
00:05:42,019 --> 00:05:43,853
Oh, nothing serious.

103
00:05:43,888 --> 00:05:46,122
<i>I just had a few moles</i>
<i>removed yesterday</i>

104
00:05:46,157 --> 00:05:49,725
and forgot I even had it on.

105
00:05:49,726 --> 00:05:54,963
Look, if Greg happens to get
back early from the conference,

106
00:05:54,998 --> 00:06:00,969
I'm staying at a hotel in town
for the next three days.

107
00:06:01,004 --> 00:06:03,371
I would like him to call me.

108
00:06:03,406 --> 00:06:05,673
I will pass it on.

109
00:06:05,708 --> 00:06:07,041
<i>Thank you.</i>

110
00:06:07,076 --> 00:06:08,642
<i>Um, do you think that</i>
<i>they would mind</i>

111
00:06:08,677 --> 00:06:10,812
if I got a refill
for the road?

112
00:06:10,846 --> 00:06:13,514
Not at all.
Good.

113
00:06:37,871 --> 00:06:39,939
Not seeing
any seizure activity

114
00:06:39,973 --> 00:06:41,974
in response
to low frequency sounds.

115
00:06:42,008 --> 00:06:43,876
I'm starting him
on mid-range.

116
00:06:43,910 --> 00:06:46,278
Have you seen his girlfriend?

117
00:06:46,312 --> 00:06:48,347
Extremely hot.

118
00:06:48,381 --> 00:06:50,716
Blind people can't have
attractive girlfriends?

119
00:06:50,751 --> 00:06:51,917
Not my point.

120
00:06:51,952 --> 00:06:53,317
He actually convinced her
to go for

121
00:06:53,352 --> 00:06:55,253
the whole relationship
break thing.

122
00:06:55,287 --> 00:06:57,021
How do you know
it wasn't her idea?

123
00:06:57,056 --> 00:06:58,957
<i>Because she's back with him.</i>

124
00:06:58,991 --> 00:07:01,359
Women suggest a break
when they wanna break up.

125
00:07:01,393 --> 00:07:02,693
Men do it because
they wanna have sex

126
00:07:02,728 --> 00:07:04,262
with other women
before they settle down.

127
00:07:04,296 --> 00:07:07,899
They're a little young to get
married, don't you think?

128
00:07:07,933 --> 00:07:11,735
I was their age when I did.

129
00:07:11,770 --> 00:07:13,436
I see your point.

130
00:07:13,471 --> 00:07:15,639
He's seizing.

131
00:07:15,673 --> 00:07:17,808
<i>Sound frequency's at 300 hertz.</i>

132
00:07:17,842 --> 00:07:20,477
It's not a seizure.

133
00:07:20,511 --> 00:07:23,413
He's not spiking on his E.E.G.

134
00:07:25,182 --> 00:07:26,482
He's not moving air.

135
00:07:26,516 --> 00:07:30,153
I I think
he's choking on something.

136
00:07:30,187 --> 00:07:31,520
Blood.

137
00:07:31,554 --> 00:07:33,222
I don't see any blockage.

138
00:07:33,257 --> 00:07:36,759
Help me move him.

139
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:47,402
Just relax and breathe.

140
00:07:55,011 --> 00:07:59,714
What--what are these?

141
00:08:02,101 --> 00:08:03,868
Three teeth detached
from his jawbone

142
00:08:03,903 --> 00:08:05,337
and lodged in his throat.

143
00:08:05,371 --> 00:08:07,172
He almost choked to death
on them.

144
00:08:07,206 --> 00:08:08,173
Environmental?

145
00:08:08,207 --> 00:08:09,341
Could be heavy metal
poisoning

146
00:08:09,375 --> 00:08:11,243
or radiation exposure.

147
00:08:11,277 --> 00:08:13,077
Then he wouldn't
be the only one.

148
00:08:13,078 --> 00:08:14,211
He's an accountant
who works

149
00:08:14,246 --> 00:08:15,646
on the same floor
with 50 other people.

150
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:20,184
Maybe his girlfriend
poisoned him.

151
00:08:20,218 --> 00:08:23,120
House usually thinks
that's a good guess.

152
00:08:23,155 --> 00:08:25,656
And she's gotta be pissed off
and have low self-esteem.

153
00:08:25,690 --> 00:08:27,158
<i>Why else would she</i>

154
00:08:27,192 --> 00:08:28,591
give him a free pass to pork
other women?

155
00:08:28,625 --> 00:08:29,592
<i>Because he's handicapped.</i>

156
00:08:29,626 --> 00:08:31,361
<i>Women feel sorry for us.</i>

157
00:08:31,395 --> 00:08:32,695
<i>This cane is tail bait.</i>

158
00:08:32,729 --> 00:08:34,597
Where are you now?

159
00:08:34,631 --> 00:08:36,499
Expect an actual answer
this time?

160
00:08:36,534 --> 00:08:37,600
<i>Hi, guys.</i>

161
00:08:37,634 --> 00:08:38,701
<i>Was wondering if House's</i>

162
00:08:38,735 --> 00:08:39,769
<i>mother left yet.</i>

163
00:08:39,803 --> 00:08:41,538
<i>He won't let me go to a hos--</i>

164
00:08:41,572 --> 00:08:43,039
<i>It's not environmental,</i>
<i>it's periodontitis.</i>

165
00:08:43,074 --> 00:08:45,407
An oral infection doesn't
explain his disorientation

166
00:08:45,442 --> 00:08:47,543
and auditory hallucinations.

167
00:08:47,577 --> 00:08:49,010
<i>They're laughing</i>
<i>because they know</i>

168
00:08:49,045 --> 00:08:50,912
<i>diabetes exacerbates</i>
<i>the condition.</i>

169
00:08:50,947 --> 00:08:53,014
<i>It could progress</i>
<i>to a systemic disease.</i>

170
00:08:53,049 --> 00:08:55,384
The bacteria spread
and affect other organs.

171
00:08:55,418 --> 00:08:56,685
<i>Like his brain.</i>

172
00:08:56,719 --> 00:08:58,554
<i>Start him on broad spectrum</i>
<i>antibiotics</i>

173
00:08:58,588 --> 00:09:00,854
<i>and book him an appointment</i>
<i>with a periodontist.</i>

174
00:09:00,889 --> 00:09:06,561
He has fake children now,
too?

175
00:09:06,595 --> 00:09:10,398
You think I'm not good enough
for your mother.

176
00:09:10,432 --> 00:09:12,433
Not in front of the kids,
Honey.

177
00:09:18,038 --> 00:09:21,475
Hey, add a couple of flies,
toss in a dead goat or two,

178
00:09:21,509 --> 00:09:22,976
we might have a winner.

179
00:09:23,010 --> 00:09:24,978
She gone?

180
00:09:25,012 --> 00:09:27,214
Yeah.

181
00:09:27,248 --> 00:09:30,083
We really need to talk.

182
00:09:30,118 --> 00:09:31,218
Okay.

183
00:09:31,252 --> 00:09:32,784
Crayons down.

184
00:09:32,819 --> 00:09:35,254
Line up if you wanna get paid.

185
00:09:38,358 --> 00:09:42,060
It's the only time I ever
successfully lie to my mom;

186
00:09:42,095 --> 00:09:43,395
<i>is through the elaborate</i>
<i>preparations</i>

187
00:09:43,430 --> 00:09:45,097
and props.

188
00:09:47,534 --> 00:09:50,401
<i>Hey, hey, hey.</i>

189
00:09:50,436 --> 00:09:53,771
I said no Transformers,
Slick.

190
00:09:55,774 --> 00:09:58,309
Stay here until
the coast is clear.

191
00:09:58,344 --> 00:10:00,411
Fine.

192
00:10:00,446 --> 00:10:02,480
But you sleep on couch
tonight.

193
00:10:02,515 --> 00:10:04,115
You sleeping with her now?

194
00:10:04,149 --> 00:10:07,284
Just in case an I.N.S. guy
comes in through the window.

195
00:10:07,318 --> 00:10:08,385
Oh.

196
00:10:08,419 --> 00:10:09,553
Yeah,
she didn't buy it either.

197
00:10:09,587 --> 00:10:11,855
You need to talk
to your mother.

198
00:10:11,889 --> 00:10:12,856
When I'm ready.

199
00:10:12,890 --> 00:10:14,491
Still need to get
a fake passport,

200
00:10:14,526 --> 00:10:16,627
doctored photos,
maybe a case of Aids.

201
00:10:16,661 --> 00:10:18,862
She's sick, House.

202
00:10:21,532 --> 00:10:23,199
Did she say that?

203
00:10:23,233 --> 00:10:25,734
She was wearing a hospital
admission bracelet

204
00:10:25,769 --> 00:10:28,638
and carrying around a book on
dealing with terminal cancer.

205
00:10:28,672 --> 00:10:32,208
I'm sorry.

206
00:10:36,712 --> 00:10:40,815
She's staying at the Grand
for the next three days.

207
00:10:52,127 --> 00:10:54,628
The antibiotics will stop
the infection

208
00:10:54,663 --> 00:10:56,430
from spreading further.

209
00:10:56,464 --> 00:10:57,698
And I'll spare you
the lecture you'll get

210
00:10:57,732 --> 00:10:58,832
from the periodontist
tomorrow,

211
00:10:58,866 --> 00:11:02,403
but you need to practice
better oral hygiene.

212
00:11:02,437 --> 00:11:05,972
So are you guys saying this is
happening because, what,

213
00:11:06,007 --> 00:11:08,274
- I didn't floss enough?
<i>-  Probably didn't help,</i>

214
00:11:08,309 --> 00:11:10,910
but diabetics are prone
to this type of infection.

215
00:11:10,944 --> 00:11:12,044
Half the time,
he doesn't even bother

216
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:13,779
getting undressed
before he goes to bed.

217
00:11:13,814 --> 00:11:15,315
<i>Can only imagine how many times</i>
<i>you've skipped</i>

218
00:11:15,349 --> 00:11:17,450
<i>brushing your teeth since we--</i>

219
00:11:19,253 --> 00:11:21,087
sorry.

220
00:11:21,121 --> 00:11:22,822
<i>I don't mean to lecture you,</i>
<i>babe.</i>

221
00:11:22,856 --> 00:11:25,857
Well, I guess you're right.

222
00:11:25,891 --> 00:11:27,959
Look, you haven't eaten
anything all day.

223
00:11:27,993 --> 00:11:30,028
Why don't you go grab a bite?

224
00:11:30,062 --> 00:11:31,730
I'll be fine.

225
00:11:34,367 --> 00:11:36,335
All right, well, I'll see you
in an hour, okay?

226
00:11:36,369 --> 00:11:38,537
Not if I see you first.

227
00:11:45,510 --> 00:11:47,778
I was wondering if I could
ask you guys for a favor.

228
00:11:47,812 --> 00:11:49,714
I really need my laptop
and braille writer,

229
00:11:49,748 --> 00:11:51,449
and I can't ask Melissa
to get them for me.

230
00:11:51,483 --> 00:11:52,617
Why not?

231
00:11:52,651 --> 00:11:54,485
Because...

232
00:11:54,519 --> 00:11:56,720
I want you to put this
someplace safe.

233
00:11:59,990 --> 00:12:01,524
It's beautiful.

234
00:12:01,559 --> 00:12:04,961
People always say
diamonds are beautiful.

235
00:12:04,995 --> 00:12:06,396
But to me they just feel cold.

236
00:12:06,430 --> 00:12:07,897
They have really sharp edges.

237
00:12:07,931 --> 00:12:12,168
I guess convincing her to take
a break was a good thing.

238
00:12:12,202 --> 00:12:14,069
Well, the break was her idea.

239
00:12:14,103 --> 00:12:16,372
<i>Melissa's the only girl</i>
<i>I've ever dated.</i>

240
00:12:16,406 --> 00:12:18,340
She wanted me to be sure
before we...

241
00:12:18,375 --> 00:12:19,575
took the next step.

242
00:12:19,609 --> 00:12:22,311
Wow.

243
00:12:22,345 --> 00:12:23,612
Yeah.

244
00:12:30,552 --> 00:12:31,719
What are you doing?

245
00:12:31,754 --> 00:12:32,720
We're here.

246
00:12:32,755 --> 00:12:33,988
We might as well
search the place

247
00:12:34,022 --> 00:12:36,190
<i>in case we're wrong about</i>
<i>periodontitis.</i>

248
00:12:42,097 --> 00:12:43,421
What are you doing?

249
00:12:43,446 --> 00:12:44,946
We're here.
Might as well eat.

250
00:12:44,999 --> 00:12:47,267
You're stealing food
from a blind man?

251
00:12:47,302 --> 00:12:49,836
We're doing him a favor.
He owes me.

252
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:52,972
I take it from your
low self-esteem theory

253
00:12:53,007 --> 00:12:58,378
you have some experience
with relationship breaks?

254
00:12:58,413 --> 00:13:01,580
What happened?

255
00:13:01,615 --> 00:13:06,585
He talked me
in it, then...

256
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:08,788
Slept with three
of my friends.

257
00:13:08,822 --> 00:13:10,456
Then dumped my ass.

258
00:13:10,490 --> 00:13:12,458
College boyfriend.

259
00:13:12,492 --> 00:13:14,293
Thought he was the love
of my life.

260
00:13:14,328 --> 00:13:16,894
Then why agree to a break?

261
00:13:16,929 --> 00:13:19,631
My self-esteem wasn't
as high back then.

262
00:13:19,665 --> 00:13:22,400
No one's is.

263
00:13:22,435 --> 00:13:24,703
Oh!

264
00:13:24,737 --> 00:13:25,770
Sugar free!

265
00:13:29,532 --> 00:13:31,224
Ugh. Disgusting.

266
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:34,607
I'll check the bathroom.
You keep checking the snacks,

267
00:13:59,069 --> 00:14:00,269
Greg.

268
00:14:00,303 --> 00:14:01,771
Sorry I didn't call first.

269
00:14:01,805 --> 00:14:04,539
I just flew back
from my conference.

270
00:14:04,574 --> 00:14:06,541
Um, this--this
really isn't, uh--

271
00:14:06,576 --> 00:14:08,109
I need your medical records

272
00:14:08,143 --> 00:14:12,280
and the name of your
primary physician.

273
00:14:12,314 --> 00:14:16,551
<i>Well,</i>
<i>you remember Mr. Bell.</i>

274
00:14:16,586 --> 00:14:19,053
Well, if I didn't,
I will now.

275
00:14:20,989 --> 00:14:23,691
You're not dying?

276
00:14:23,725 --> 00:14:27,395
I, uh...I may have
mislead James

277
00:14:27,429 --> 00:14:30,063
by letting him see
a book on cancer.

278
00:14:30,098 --> 00:14:31,164
We did, however,
have some expectations

279
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:33,133
that you might call first.

280
00:14:33,167 --> 00:14:35,603
Yeah.

281
00:14:39,373 --> 00:14:41,641
This isn't how I envisioned
you finding out.

282
00:14:41,675 --> 00:14:45,177
Mr. Bell and I, we're...

283
00:14:45,212 --> 00:14:46,513
Having sex, got it.

284
00:14:46,547 --> 00:14:48,180
Getting married.

285
00:14:48,215 --> 00:14:49,682
Also.

286
00:14:49,717 --> 00:14:53,152
We wanted you to be
the first to know.

287
00:14:56,456 --> 00:14:59,458
I need 10 milligrams
of benzodiazepine.

288
00:14:59,492 --> 00:15:01,193
Help me hold him down.

289
00:15:13,077 --> 00:15:14,754
I'm putting epilepsy back
on the table.

290
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:16,383
And I'm taking it off
because

291
00:15:16,417 --> 00:15:17,518
<i>it doesn't explain</i>
<i>losing his teeth.</i>

292
00:15:17,552 --> 00:15:18,953
<i>The kid's diabetic.</i>

293
00:15:18,987 --> 00:15:21,021
The periodontitis could be real
but completely unrelated.

294
00:15:21,055 --> 00:15:24,090
Coincidence.
Buying that, House?

295
00:15:24,125 --> 00:15:26,592
Until I hear something
that takes my mind off

296
00:15:26,627 --> 00:15:30,329
the Jurassic schlong that I was
traumatized by this afternoon.

297
00:15:30,364 --> 00:15:32,532
I know what's wrong
with the patient.

298
00:15:32,566 --> 00:15:35,068
Illegal drugs.
Some kind of acid.

299
00:15:35,102 --> 00:15:37,235
His tox screens
were clean.

300
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:39,337
His apartment wasn't.

301
00:15:39,372 --> 00:15:41,140
We didn't find any drugs.

302
00:15:41,174 --> 00:15:46,645
Then why am I completely
tripping balls right now?

303
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:50,515
I'm seriously freaking out
here, guys.

304
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:52,583
Can't you tell?

305
00:15:52,617 --> 00:15:54,652
You pretty much look the same
as you always do.

306
00:15:54,687 --> 00:15:57,221
Take your glasses off.

307
00:16:01,226 --> 00:16:04,896
Pupils dilated...

308
00:16:04,930 --> 00:16:08,865
Pulse elevated.
Hallucinating?

309
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:11,935
I think so, because...

310
00:16:11,969 --> 00:16:13,804
He's a rabbit.

311
00:16:26,583 --> 00:16:27,883
<i>Oh, I get it.</i>

312
00:16:27,918 --> 00:16:31,153
Because she's his wife.

313
00:16:31,188 --> 00:16:34,757
They flirt a lot.
I've seen things.

314
00:16:42,031 --> 00:16:45,100
Mm, Taub--
Taub is either...

315
00:16:45,134 --> 00:16:50,772
A tooth fairy or...
Rainbow Brite.

316
00:16:53,709 --> 00:16:56,576
And you...

317
00:16:56,611 --> 00:17:00,180
You're just House.

318
00:17:00,215 --> 00:17:03,117
She ate ice cream
and Gummi Bears

319
00:17:03,151 --> 00:17:04,417
at the patient's apartment.

320
00:17:04,452 --> 00:17:06,787
One of 'em must have
been dosed with it.

321
00:17:06,821 --> 00:17:08,088
Go back and find the drugs.
You two,

322
00:17:08,123 --> 00:17:09,489
<i>find out where</i>
<i>he bought them,</i>

323
00:17:09,523 --> 00:17:10,791
and then MRI his brain.

324
00:17:10,825 --> 00:17:13,159
<i>Check for infections,</i>
<i>masses, and plaques.</i>

325
00:17:13,193 --> 00:17:15,795
Am I gonna die?

326
00:17:15,829 --> 00:17:18,197
We'll get back to you
on that.

327
00:17:22,202 --> 00:17:24,771
I've been blind since birth.

328
00:17:24,805 --> 00:17:26,505
I thought maybe
if I tried LSD,

329
00:17:26,539 --> 00:17:31,676
I might, you know...
Colors...a shape.

330
00:17:31,710 --> 00:17:33,779
<i>I just--</i>

331
00:17:33,813 --> 00:17:35,647
I just wanted
to see something.

332
00:17:35,681 --> 00:17:38,083
How many times?
Maybe five or six.

333
00:17:38,117 --> 00:17:39,117
We need to know
where you bought it

334
00:17:39,152 --> 00:17:41,953
so we can find out
what was in it.

335
00:17:41,988 --> 00:17:43,988
My girlfriend gave it to me.

336
00:17:44,022 --> 00:17:46,056
I'll find her.
No, don't.

337
00:17:46,091 --> 00:17:48,859
It--it wasn't Melissa.

338
00:17:48,894 --> 00:17:50,761
I met someone else.

339
00:17:52,864 --> 00:17:56,200
When were you planning
on telling her that,

340
00:17:56,234 --> 00:17:58,135
before or after
you ask her to marry you?

341
00:17:58,170 --> 00:18:01,237
The ring isn't for her.

342
00:18:01,272 --> 00:18:02,705
We were on a break.

343
00:18:02,739 --> 00:18:05,074
She wanted me to see
what else was out there,

344
00:18:05,109 --> 00:18:06,342
and I did.

345
00:18:06,376 --> 00:18:08,744
<i>I was gonna tell her</i>
<i>the other night,</i>

346
00:18:08,779 --> 00:18:10,847
but I ended up here
instead.

347
00:18:10,881 --> 00:18:12,882
We just need to talk to the one
who supplied the drugs.

348
00:18:12,917 --> 00:18:16,151
She's on vacation
with her parents.

349
00:18:16,186 --> 00:18:17,552
This is her cell.

350
00:18:17,586 --> 00:18:19,321
I don't want her to know
I'm in the hospital.

351
00:18:19,355 --> 00:18:21,056
She'll only freak out.

352
00:18:21,090 --> 00:18:22,724
That's very considerate
of you.

353
00:18:22,758 --> 00:18:26,195
You think this is easy
for me.

354
00:18:26,229 --> 00:18:28,063
I know I have to
tell Melissa.

355
00:18:28,097 --> 00:18:29,497
Well, what's stopping you?

356
00:18:29,532 --> 00:18:30,833
<i>She's still one</i>
<i>of my best friends.</i>

357
00:18:30,867 --> 00:18:34,435
And I don't want to be
alone in here.

358
00:18:45,613 --> 00:18:46,814
Have you seen
your mother yet?

359
00:18:46,849 --> 00:18:47,881
<i>She's not dying.</i>

360
00:18:47,915 --> 00:18:50,683
She was having sex
with my father.

361
00:18:52,653 --> 00:18:54,687
Ignore her.
She's on acid.

362
00:18:54,722 --> 00:18:58,191
Your father's dead,
House.

363
00:18:58,226 --> 00:19:01,294
Not the dead dad,
the biological dad.

364
00:19:01,329 --> 00:19:03,596
The one I pointed out to you
at fake father's funeral.

365
00:19:03,630 --> 00:19:07,466
Huh.

366
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:08,700
Are you sure?

367
00:19:08,735 --> 00:19:11,670
Your only evidence is
that birthmark you saw

368
00:19:11,704 --> 00:19:13,739
when you were 12.

369
00:19:13,773 --> 00:19:16,242
Well, now I've seen two.

370
00:19:16,276 --> 00:19:20,378
Good news is I won't
technically be a bastard

371
00:19:20,412 --> 00:19:21,679
much longer.

372
00:19:21,713 --> 00:19:24,249
We're gonna be one big
crappy family.

373
00:19:24,283 --> 00:19:29,420
Well, that's--
that's great news.

374
00:19:29,454 --> 00:19:31,222
Your mother won't
be alone anymore,

375
00:19:31,257 --> 00:19:33,291
and you can finally
get to know the guy.

376
00:19:33,325 --> 00:19:35,793
Yes, that is one option.

377
00:19:35,827 --> 00:19:39,897
Are you saying you're
not even curious?

378
00:19:39,931 --> 00:19:40,998
You want to know
what I think?

379
00:19:41,032 --> 00:19:43,200
I think you know the answer
to that question.

380
00:19:43,234 --> 00:19:45,402
You avoid your mother
because she's the one person

381
00:19:45,436 --> 00:19:47,204
whose opinion
you actually care about.

382
00:19:47,238 --> 00:19:49,672
If that was true, you'd have
every reason to shut up.

383
00:19:49,707 --> 00:19:51,775
I avoid my mother
because she's boring.

384
00:19:51,809 --> 00:19:53,575
That's why you've been
so open and honest

385
00:19:53,610 --> 00:19:56,279
about prison and marrying
a complete stranger.

386
00:19:56,313 --> 00:19:57,679
Even if I care
what she thinks,

387
00:19:57,714 --> 00:20:00,449
why would I care
what some sperm donor does?

388
00:20:00,483 --> 00:20:01,984
You read the guy's book
about three times.

389
00:20:02,019 --> 00:20:03,185
Years ago.

390
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:07,123
It took three times because
it was so badly written.

391
00:20:07,157 --> 00:20:09,391
Oh, I get it.

392
00:20:09,425 --> 00:20:12,093
The second birthmark
was on his penis, right?

393
00:20:16,132 --> 00:20:17,532
He's a dick.

394
00:20:17,566 --> 00:20:19,100
<i>You've been working</i>
<i>for House for months</i>

395
00:20:19,135 --> 00:20:20,435
and just now realized

396
00:20:20,469 --> 00:20:22,370
that disabled people
can also be dicks?

397
00:20:22,405 --> 00:20:24,972
What he's doing now
to that girl isn't fair.

398
00:20:25,006 --> 00:20:26,607
The break was her idea.

399
00:20:26,642 --> 00:20:30,411
And now she thinks
they're back together.

400
00:20:30,446 --> 00:20:33,848
He's a scared, sick, blind kid
who doesn't want to be alone.

401
00:20:33,882 --> 00:20:35,650
You really don't get that?

402
00:20:35,684 --> 00:20:39,554
I do, but...

403
00:20:39,588 --> 00:20:41,922
What is it?

404
00:20:41,956 --> 00:20:46,326
Not good news for him...
Or Park.

405
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,900
Where's Park?

406
00:20:55,934 --> 00:20:58,169
Wilson's babysitting her.

407
00:20:58,203 --> 00:20:59,871
Talking about the fact
that she could have

408
00:20:59,905 --> 00:21:03,440
permanent brain damage might
bum her trip out a little bit.

409
00:21:03,475 --> 00:21:06,310
A dark spot doesn't necessarily
equal brain damage.

410
00:21:06,344 --> 00:21:08,245
It could be
a congenital malformation

411
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:09,647
connected with his blindness

412
00:21:09,682 --> 00:21:11,115
or a tumor.

413
00:21:11,150 --> 00:21:13,249
A clot.
Exactly.

414
00:21:13,284 --> 00:21:15,719
We need to do another scan,
but inject dye and figure out--

415
00:21:15,753 --> 00:21:16,720
I said "a clot,"

416
00:21:16,754 --> 00:21:18,388
not <i>"or</i> a clot."

417
00:21:18,422 --> 00:21:21,324
It's a clot.

418
00:21:21,358 --> 00:21:23,393
Cerebral venous
sinus thrombosis.

419
00:21:23,427 --> 00:21:24,695
<i>Good news for Park.</i>

420
00:21:24,729 --> 00:21:26,897
I've never seen one
present this large before.

421
00:21:26,931 --> 00:21:28,497
It fits.
When it was smaller,

422
00:21:28,531 --> 00:21:30,399
it caused his initial
disorientation

423
00:21:30,433 --> 00:21:31,633
and hallucinations.

424
00:21:31,668 --> 00:21:33,102
<i>As it grew larger,</i>
<i>the seizures.</i>

425
00:21:33,136 --> 00:21:36,271
If left untreated, it leads
to cerebral edema and death.

426
00:21:36,306 --> 00:21:38,007
But what causes that
and tooth loss?

427
00:21:38,041 --> 00:21:41,744
Any hyper-coagulable state.
Lupus?

428
00:21:41,778 --> 00:21:46,480
I counter your lupus
with Behcet's syndrome.

429
00:21:46,515 --> 00:21:48,683
No, he doesn't have
any of the earlier symptoms--

430
00:21:48,718 --> 00:21:52,187
color blindness,
abnormal visual fields or--

431
00:21:55,591 --> 00:21:59,127
we've been ignoring his eyes
because he's blind.

432
00:22:00,461 --> 00:22:04,231
Well, if he wasn't before,
he would be by now.

433
00:22:04,265 --> 00:22:05,498
Confirm with an eye exam,

434
00:22:05,533 --> 00:22:07,634
start treatment with heparin
for the clot.

435
00:22:07,668 --> 00:22:11,605
Interferon and steroids
for the Behcet's.

436
00:22:11,639 --> 00:22:12,773
No, no!

437
00:22:12,807 --> 00:22:15,842
Give me back my teeth!
Park, listen. Park--

438
00:22:15,876 --> 00:22:17,243
You're a tooth thief!

439
00:22:17,277 --> 00:22:19,511
No, no, no.
Stop it, stop it!

440
00:22:19,546 --> 00:22:22,514
Ki-ki-ki!
Back on the couch.

441
00:22:22,549 --> 00:22:24,583
What are you doing
to this poor girl?

442
00:22:24,618 --> 00:22:27,086
It's not what it looks like.
She--oh!

443
00:22:29,089 --> 00:22:31,224
She's tripping on acid.

444
00:22:31,258 --> 00:22:32,523
Good lord, man,

445
00:22:32,558 --> 00:22:35,360
that's no way
to treat a bad trip.

446
00:22:35,394 --> 00:22:36,594
Put the chair down.

447
00:22:36,629 --> 00:22:38,730
You'll end up hurting
the poor wee thing.

448
00:22:38,765 --> 00:22:41,432
There you are.

449
00:22:41,467 --> 00:22:42,801
Hello, darlin'.

450
00:22:42,835 --> 00:22:44,402
<i>I'm Thomas,</i>

451
00:22:44,436 --> 00:22:46,171
and this beautiful
creature here is Blythe.

452
00:22:46,205 --> 00:22:48,239
Is there anything
we can do to help you?

453
00:22:48,273 --> 00:22:50,641
That rabbit
stole my teeth.

454
00:22:50,675 --> 00:22:52,777
Of course he did, but I'll
tell you what he's done.

455
00:22:52,811 --> 00:22:55,579
He's put them back again,
and they're twice as nice

456
00:22:55,613 --> 00:22:56,580
as they used to be.

457
00:22:56,614 --> 00:22:59,716
You can feel them
if you like.

458
00:23:02,487 --> 00:23:03,787
<i>See?</i>

459
00:23:03,821 --> 00:23:06,455
Now, why don't we sit
on this nice comfy couch,

460
00:23:06,490 --> 00:23:08,758
have a nice cool drink
and talk all about it.

461
00:23:08,793 --> 00:23:12,061
Would you like that?

462
00:23:13,831 --> 00:23:16,966
He's had some experience
with things like this,

463
00:23:17,001 --> 00:23:18,567
back in the day.

464
00:23:18,602 --> 00:23:20,936
As I recall, both of us--

465
00:23:20,970 --> 00:23:23,505
Uh, not the time
or the place, dear.

466
00:23:26,309 --> 00:23:28,010
<i>There you are.</i>

467
00:23:28,044 --> 00:23:31,346
See? There you are.

468
00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:35,717
There's no way
that guy's related to you.

469
00:23:41,990 --> 00:23:44,391
There's fresh scarring
and swelling in both fundi,

470
00:23:44,426 --> 00:23:46,627
and a bleed on the left.
House was right.

471
00:23:46,661 --> 00:23:48,196
It's Behcet's syndrome.

472
00:23:48,230 --> 00:23:51,165
Give it to me straight, Doc.

473
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:53,633
Am I ever gonna see again?

474
00:23:53,667 --> 00:23:56,036
That's a little out
of our jurisdiction.

475
00:23:56,070 --> 00:23:58,038
We need to wrap a dressing
over your eyes

476
00:23:58,072 --> 00:23:59,439
to keep the light out.

477
00:23:59,473 --> 00:24:02,008
Not really a problem
for me.

478
00:24:02,043 --> 00:24:03,743
You might not see it,
but your tissue does.

479
00:24:03,777 --> 00:24:06,146
It'll also help
with the swelling.

480
00:24:06,180 --> 00:24:08,047
I'll leave you in Dr. Adams'
capable hands.

481
00:24:16,890 --> 00:24:20,525
You think I'm an ass,
don't you?

482
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:22,594
I can tell
by your breathing.

483
00:24:22,628 --> 00:24:27,131
Either you're angry
or fat.

484
00:24:27,166 --> 00:24:29,267
I think it's unfair that
you're leading on a woman

485
00:24:29,301 --> 00:24:31,435
who obviously loves
and cares about you.

486
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:33,537
<i>I love and care</i>
<i>about her too.</i>

487
00:24:33,572 --> 00:24:37,008
But we just don't
work together as a couple.

488
00:24:37,042 --> 00:24:39,010
You need to tell her that.

489
00:24:39,044 --> 00:24:40,911
<i>I'm going to.</i>

490
00:24:40,945 --> 00:24:44,681
But I just want to do it
the right way.

491
00:24:44,715 --> 00:24:46,549
<i>I don't want her</i>
<i>to hate me.</i>

492
00:24:46,584 --> 00:24:48,418
When she finds out
you bought an engagement ring

493
00:24:48,452 --> 00:24:51,889
for another woman,
that option is out the window.

494
00:24:51,923 --> 00:24:53,590
It was gonna be for her.

495
00:24:53,624 --> 00:24:56,359
What changed?

496
00:24:56,393 --> 00:24:58,027
<i>She told me we were</i>
<i>going on a break.</i>

497
00:24:58,061 --> 00:25:00,329
I didn't even get a say
in the matter.

498
00:25:00,364 --> 00:25:03,199
She wanted you to be sure
about your relationship.

499
00:25:03,233 --> 00:25:05,434
I can see how that
would be annoying.

500
00:25:05,468 --> 00:25:09,005
I think I liked it better when
you were just breathing angrily.

501
00:25:13,742 --> 00:25:16,011
She still sees me
as the same sheltered,

502
00:25:16,045 --> 00:25:18,346
blind geek
she met in college.

503
00:25:18,381 --> 00:25:20,548
Most of the time
she acts more like my mother

504
00:25:20,582 --> 00:25:22,550
than my girlfriend.

505
00:25:22,584 --> 00:25:24,019
I asked her to marry me.

506
00:25:24,053 --> 00:25:27,455
She tells me I need
to date somebody else first.

507
00:25:27,489 --> 00:25:29,390
I'd rather
she just dumped me.

508
00:25:29,424 --> 00:25:31,425
<i>At least that</i>
<i>I can understand.</i>

509
00:25:31,459 --> 00:25:33,193
So you were hurt
so much

510
00:25:33,228 --> 00:25:35,695
you had to marry
the next woman you met?

511
00:25:35,730 --> 00:25:37,898
<i>Julie doesn't see me</i>
<i>as I was,</i>

512
00:25:37,933 --> 00:25:40,600
but for who I am now.

513
00:25:40,635 --> 00:25:42,202
She trusts me to make
my own decisions

514
00:25:42,237 --> 00:25:44,003
and to help her with hers.

515
00:25:44,038 --> 00:25:46,272
For the first time
in my life,

516
00:25:46,307 --> 00:25:49,875
I have somebody
who needs me...

517
00:25:49,910 --> 00:25:54,147
Instead of
the other way around.

518
00:26:01,554 --> 00:26:03,255
Ah, she finally
fell asleep.

519
00:26:03,289 --> 00:26:05,223
I think she'll be fine
in a couple of hours.

520
00:26:05,258 --> 00:26:09,027
How do you know about
handling a bad acid trip?

521
00:26:09,062 --> 00:26:11,663
Friends in your gardening club
been experimenting again?

522
00:26:11,697 --> 00:26:14,232
I was young once.

523
00:26:18,770 --> 00:26:22,974
A little scrapbook
that Thomas threw together.

524
00:26:23,008 --> 00:26:26,577
He even has a couple
of pictures of you as a child.

525
00:26:26,611 --> 00:26:29,447
<i>And I've known Greg almost</i>
<i>since he was born, you know.</i>

526
00:26:29,481 --> 00:26:31,315
His father and I were
like brothers.

527
00:26:31,350 --> 00:26:33,716
I was a Navy chaplain
in those days.

528
00:26:33,750 --> 00:26:36,052
I left the service
in the late '60s.

529
00:26:36,087 --> 00:26:37,587
<i>I don't think his dad</i>
<i>ever forgave me</i>

530
00:26:37,621 --> 00:26:39,789
<i>for protesting the war.</i>

531
00:26:39,823 --> 00:26:41,757
Of course, if he knew
I'd got Blythe involved...

532
00:26:41,792 --> 00:26:43,793
You protested the war?
When?

533
00:26:43,827 --> 00:26:45,161
You were a child.

534
00:26:45,196 --> 00:26:47,563
I didn't share
my entire schedule with you.

535
00:26:47,598 --> 00:26:49,465
We knew if we told you,
you'd tell him,

536
00:26:49,499 --> 00:26:50,632
and he'd kill us both.

537
00:26:50,666 --> 00:26:52,834
He was a marine.
It was the ultimate betrayal.

538
00:26:52,869 --> 00:26:55,437
Penultimate.

539
00:26:55,472 --> 00:26:58,107
Sweetheart, I think we need
to get back to the hotel.

540
00:26:58,141 --> 00:27:01,576
Wilson, it's been
a real pleasure.

541
00:27:05,847 --> 00:27:09,650
You're right.
Much too formal.

542
00:27:09,684 --> 00:27:12,620
Come here, lad.

543
00:27:13,855 --> 00:27:15,923
We're practically family now.

544
00:27:15,957 --> 00:27:18,826
We'll see you boys tonight.

545
00:27:18,860 --> 00:27:20,527
8:00 sharp.

546
00:27:23,364 --> 00:27:25,965
I invited them
out to dinner.

547
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,800
Told them it was
your idea.

548
00:27:30,438 --> 00:27:32,972
Straw.

549
00:27:40,013 --> 00:27:41,980
I know we agreed that
whatever happened on break

550
00:27:42,015 --> 00:27:43,815
would stay on break,
and I don't expect you

551
00:27:43,850 --> 00:27:45,217
to talk about yours.

552
00:27:45,252 --> 00:27:51,390
But I just want you to know
that there was no one else.

553
00:27:51,425 --> 00:27:52,990
I missed you so much,

554
00:27:53,025 --> 00:27:57,195
I barely even saw
my own friends.

555
00:27:57,229 --> 00:27:59,697
I'm just so glad
it's finally over.

556
00:27:59,731 --> 00:28:01,466
Are you okay?

557
00:28:05,371 --> 00:28:06,671
<i>What's happening</i>
<i>to him?</i>

558
00:28:19,006 --> 00:28:20,239
Is he going to be okay?

559
00:28:20,274 --> 00:28:23,810
I'm going to need to discuss
that with my colleagues.

560
00:28:24,747 --> 00:28:26,325
We have to talk.

561
00:28:26,326 --> 00:28:28,260
No, you need to rest.

562
00:28:28,294 --> 00:28:29,928
<i>I have to tell you about...</i>

563
00:28:29,962 --> 00:28:31,730
About what happened on break.

564
00:28:31,764 --> 00:28:32,963
<i>Later. You just</i>
<i>lie back and relax--</i>

565
00:28:32,997 --> 00:28:35,233
stop it, Melissa!

566
00:28:35,267 --> 00:28:38,135
Just stop telling me
what I need,

567
00:28:38,169 --> 00:28:41,739
<i>and listen for once,</i>
<i>okay?</i>

568
00:28:49,847 --> 00:28:51,581
How are you feeling?

569
00:28:51,616 --> 00:28:53,182
Embarrassed.

570
00:28:53,217 --> 00:28:55,485
I'm still not sure
what was real

571
00:28:55,519 --> 00:28:58,054
or what I hallucinated.

572
00:28:58,088 --> 00:29:00,757
Did you try to kiss me?

573
00:29:00,791 --> 00:29:04,493
What about you?

574
00:29:04,527 --> 00:29:06,161
He's stabilized
for the moment.

575
00:29:06,195 --> 00:29:07,429
<i>Coughing up blood.</i>

576
00:29:07,464 --> 00:29:08,897
<i>That doesn't really</i>
<i>change anything.</i>

577
00:29:08,931 --> 00:29:10,999
<i>Hemoptysis is a symptom</i>
<i>of Behcet's.</i>

578
00:29:11,033 --> 00:29:13,402
<i>Except our treatment should</i>
<i>make him better, not worse.</i>

579
00:29:13,436 --> 00:29:14,670
<i>It could be doing both.</i>

580
00:29:14,704 --> 00:29:16,639
Our treatment breaks down
his clot in his head,

581
00:29:16,673 --> 00:29:19,808
like it's supposed to,
except a piece broke off

582
00:29:19,842 --> 00:29:22,076
<i>and traveled to one</i>
<i>of his arteries in his lungs.</i>

583
00:29:22,110 --> 00:29:24,746
If anything, we need
to increase the heparin

584
00:29:24,780 --> 00:29:26,414
to prevent further clots
from forming.

585
00:29:26,448 --> 00:29:27,982
If we do that
and he starts hemorrhaging,

586
00:29:28,016 --> 00:29:29,350
we won't be able
to stop the bleeding.

587
00:29:29,385 --> 00:29:30,685
<i>If we don't do that,</i>
<i>the next clot</i>

588
00:29:30,719 --> 00:29:33,521
could cause a heart attack
or a stroke.

589
00:29:33,555 --> 00:29:35,856
Park's way, he at least
has a shot at living.

590
00:29:35,891 --> 00:29:39,660
<i>CT his lungs to confirm,</i>
<i>and up the dose.</i>

591
00:29:44,899 --> 00:29:48,067
She's young and hot.
She'll bounce back.

592
00:29:48,102 --> 00:29:52,471
82 pounds.

593
00:29:52,506 --> 00:29:57,276
How much weight I put on when
my break ended the same way.

594
00:29:57,311 --> 00:30:03,115
People were calling me
Park-ing-lot.

595
00:30:03,149 --> 00:30:07,453
Hmm...Almost 9:00.

596
00:30:07,487 --> 00:30:09,688
I think your boy
is gonna stand us up.

597
00:30:09,722 --> 00:30:11,856
No, no, he'll be here.

598
00:30:11,890 --> 00:30:14,626
<i>Practically walked in</i>
<i>on us having sex.</i>

599
00:30:14,660 --> 00:30:16,461
God, if I saw my mother
doing that,

600
00:30:16,495 --> 00:30:18,863
I'd claw my own eyes out.

601
00:30:18,897 --> 00:30:23,067
Of course, she was nowhere
near as attractive as you.

602
00:30:23,101 --> 00:30:26,370
Horribly fat,
as a matter of fact.

603
00:30:26,404 --> 00:30:27,504
<i>Mother...</i>

604
00:30:27,539 --> 00:30:30,006
Guy sleeping
with my mother,

605
00:30:30,041 --> 00:30:33,210
this is Dominika, my wife.

606
00:30:33,244 --> 00:30:36,580
<i>It's so nice</i>
<i>to be meeting you.</i>

607
00:30:36,614 --> 00:30:40,883
Gregory tells me that you were
born in Richmond, Virginia,

608
00:30:40,917 --> 00:30:44,487
and your father was a tailor
who stole from his clients.

609
00:30:44,521 --> 00:30:47,757
James has persuaded me
of the value

610
00:30:47,791 --> 00:30:50,426
of openness and honesty
in relationships.

611
00:30:54,698 --> 00:30:58,867
We see people with disabilities
all the time, but...

612
00:30:58,901 --> 00:31:03,739
Seeing and understanding aren't
always the same thing.

613
00:31:08,277 --> 00:31:11,045
Are you talking to me
or writing a Facebook post?

614
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:12,646
I'm saying we should have
picked up on the degeneration

615
00:31:12,681 --> 00:31:13,981
in his eyes sooner.

616
00:31:14,015 --> 00:31:16,250
We ignored them
because we assumed

617
00:31:16,284 --> 00:31:17,685
they weren't even part
of the equation.

618
00:31:17,719 --> 00:31:20,855
<i>I also realized,</i>
<i>intellectually,</i>

619
00:31:20,889 --> 00:31:23,991
I may understand what it means
to be disabled,

620
00:31:24,025 --> 00:31:25,893
but emotionally,
I didn't have a clue.

621
00:31:25,927 --> 00:31:28,729
<i>Apparently, his girlfriend</i>
<i>didn't either.</i>

622
00:31:28,764 --> 00:31:30,497
So you're back
on his side?

623
00:31:30,531 --> 00:31:32,832
It's not a side.
It's a perspective.

624
00:31:32,867 --> 00:31:34,634
He just wants to be treated
like an adult,

625
00:31:34,668 --> 00:31:36,636
make his own decisions.

626
00:31:36,670 --> 00:31:38,272
I may not agree
with all of them,

627
00:31:38,306 --> 00:31:42,442
but how the hell
can I judge him?

628
00:31:42,476 --> 00:31:45,344
I'm sure that's exactly
what disabled people want,

629
00:31:45,379 --> 00:31:47,513
to be treated like
completely foreign entities,

630
00:31:47,547 --> 00:31:52,351
incapable of being judged
and understood.

631
00:31:54,154 --> 00:31:56,088
Park was right
about the clot.

632
00:31:56,123 --> 00:32:00,726
Hopefully the anticoagulants
keep it from killing him.

633
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:02,994
So...She gets the couch

634
00:32:03,029 --> 00:32:04,429
on the odd nights,

635
00:32:04,463 --> 00:32:05,964
and I get the bed
on evens.

636
00:32:05,998 --> 00:32:08,599
<i>In exchange for</i>
<i>a federal felony,</i>

637
00:32:08,634 --> 00:32:10,302
<i>she gets a green card,</i>

638
00:32:10,336 --> 00:32:12,270
and I get a live-in maid.

639
00:32:14,073 --> 00:32:15,240
Good for you.

640
00:32:15,274 --> 00:32:19,310
The immigration policy
in this country is a travesty.

641
00:32:19,344 --> 00:32:21,678
It forces people to lie just
so nice people can stay here.

642
00:32:21,712 --> 00:32:24,448
Thank you...Dad.

643
00:32:28,119 --> 00:32:32,056
I'm grateful you approve.

644
00:32:32,090 --> 00:32:34,424
You should also know that
I was not in Africa

645
00:32:34,458 --> 00:32:35,658
<i>the last year.</i>

646
00:32:35,692 --> 00:32:36,960
You were in jail.

647
00:32:36,994 --> 00:32:40,763
I've been reading
the Princeton police blotter

648
00:32:40,797 --> 00:32:43,699
ever since you moved here.

649
00:32:43,733 --> 00:32:51,873
And I'm afraid I haven't
been truthful with you either.

650
00:32:51,907 --> 00:32:55,110
And I've wanted to tell you this
for a very long time.

651
00:32:57,213 --> 00:32:59,714
Thomas and I...

652
00:32:59,748 --> 00:33:03,018
<i>We got married two months</i>
<i>after your father passed away.</i>

653
00:33:03,052 --> 00:33:05,119
Uh-huh.
You understand,

654
00:33:05,153 --> 00:33:07,188
we didn't want you to think
we were disrespecting

655
00:33:07,222 --> 00:33:10,691
the memory of your father.

656
00:33:10,725 --> 00:33:14,561
And...Is there
another secret

657
00:33:14,596 --> 00:33:16,230
that you want to share
with me?

658
00:33:19,868 --> 00:33:21,102
No.

659
00:33:21,136 --> 00:33:23,837
There's nothing you think
might be relevant

660
00:33:23,872 --> 00:33:25,973
to my life?

661
00:33:26,007 --> 00:33:28,274
Like...What?
I don't know.

662
00:33:28,309 --> 00:33:29,576
Just off the top
of my head,

663
00:33:29,611 --> 00:33:33,013
something like I DNA-tested
my dad and found that

664
00:33:33,047 --> 00:33:34,581
he was not
my biological father--

665
00:33:34,616 --> 00:33:36,016
you are.

666
00:33:36,050 --> 00:33:38,951
That's impossible.

667
00:33:38,986 --> 00:33:42,822
People lie.
Birthmarks don't.

668
00:33:47,761 --> 00:33:49,896
Oh, my God!

669
00:33:51,464 --> 00:33:53,932
You told me
he was a premie.

670
00:33:53,966 --> 00:33:56,668
This bloody lunatic
is my <i>son!</i>

671
00:33:56,702 --> 00:33:58,102
He's not a lunatic.

672
00:33:58,137 --> 00:33:59,571
All those years
you could have told me.

673
00:33:59,605 --> 00:34:00,839
I could have done things.

674
00:34:00,873 --> 00:34:03,274
That could have made
a difference in the boy's life.

675
00:34:03,308 --> 00:34:04,976
I think we should all
just calm down.

676
00:34:05,011 --> 00:34:06,244
Look at him sitting there--

677
00:34:06,278 --> 00:34:08,179
a pill-popping sociopath!

678
00:34:08,213 --> 00:34:09,947
If you wanted
to screw up his life,

679
00:34:09,981 --> 00:34:11,582
you couldn't have
done it better.

680
00:34:11,616 --> 00:34:12,783
He's got you there, mom.

681
00:34:12,817 --> 00:34:14,885
He's one of the most
well-respected doctors

682
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:16,186
in the world.

683
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:19,957
He's saved more lives
than you can count.

684
00:34:19,991 --> 00:34:22,893
Now, you apologize to him,
or I swear,

685
00:34:22,928 --> 00:34:25,362
you will never
see me again, Thomas.

686
00:34:25,396 --> 00:34:27,797
I can't deal with this
anymore.

687
00:34:27,831 --> 00:34:29,632
He's my <i>son?</i>

688
00:34:29,667 --> 00:34:31,668
I'm having a bloody breath
of fresh air,

689
00:34:31,702 --> 00:34:34,804
that's what I'm doing.

690
00:34:39,977 --> 00:34:42,844
So, who's for dessert?

691
00:34:45,715 --> 00:34:50,118
Somebody help me!

692
00:34:50,152 --> 00:34:51,519
Uhh! Somebody--

693
00:34:51,554 --> 00:34:54,389
Will? It's Dr. Adams
and Dr. Chase.

694
00:34:54,423 --> 00:34:56,892
We just need to know--
My eyes! My eyes!

695
00:34:56,926 --> 00:34:59,560
It feels like
it's on fire!

696
00:35:09,659 --> 00:35:10,793
It's not behcet's.

697
00:35:10,827 --> 00:35:12,127
It doesn't necrotize tissue
like this.

698
00:35:12,618 --> 00:35:14,418
I think it's
streptococcus pyogenes.

699
00:35:14,452 --> 00:35:15,920
Except we've already
treated him

700
00:35:15,954 --> 00:35:17,654
with broad spectrum
antibiotics.

701
00:35:17,689 --> 00:35:19,924
It shouldn't be spreading.
It should be dying.

702
00:35:19,958 --> 00:35:21,993
Just means
it's drug-resistant.

703
00:35:22,027 --> 00:35:23,660
We need to remove
what's left of his eyes

704
00:35:23,695 --> 00:35:25,162
before
the gangrene sets in.

705
00:35:25,197 --> 00:35:27,298
It's something that looks
and acts like a bacteria

706
00:35:27,332 --> 00:35:28,732
but isn't one.

707
00:35:28,767 --> 00:35:30,733
Could be viral.
No, it couldn't.

708
00:35:30,768 --> 00:35:32,002
There's no evidence
of viral markers

709
00:35:32,036 --> 00:35:34,271
in the necrotized tissue.

710
00:35:36,140 --> 00:35:37,707
Let me see that image
you took last night

711
00:35:37,741 --> 00:35:39,142
of the clot in his lung.

712
00:35:48,985 --> 00:35:52,121
That's not a piece of the clot
from his brain.

713
00:35:52,155 --> 00:35:55,824
That's the point
of infection.

714
00:35:55,858 --> 00:35:58,027
Mucormycosis.

715
00:35:58,061 --> 00:35:59,461
<i>He breathed in the spores,</i>

716
00:35:59,495 --> 00:36:02,030
it's been growing
and spreading ever since.

717
00:36:02,064 --> 00:36:03,631
A fungal infection
spreading this fast?

718
00:36:03,665 --> 00:36:04,933
<i>Kid's a diabetic.</i>

719
00:36:04,967 --> 00:36:06,434
He already has
a compromised immune system.

720
00:36:06,468 --> 00:36:08,602
He's right.
This sample from his eyes

721
00:36:08,637 --> 00:36:09,670
is crawling with it.

722
00:36:09,704 --> 00:36:12,506
Treat with amphotericin b.

723
00:36:12,541 --> 00:36:14,108
We treated him
with gentamicin

724
00:36:14,143 --> 00:36:15,476
when we thought
it was bacterial,

725
00:36:15,510 --> 00:36:17,778
<i>which means the dose</i>
<i>of amphotericin b we'll need</i>

726
00:36:17,813 --> 00:36:20,647
to cure him will probably
leave him deaf.

727
00:36:20,681 --> 00:36:23,383
Sorry, I stopped listening
after you said

728
00:36:23,418 --> 00:36:26,286
"the dose we'll need
to <i>cure</i> him."

729
00:36:34,594 --> 00:36:38,998
Blind and deaf?

730
00:36:39,032 --> 00:36:42,568
I'd rather be dead.

731
00:36:42,602 --> 00:36:43,836
You will be.

732
00:36:46,906 --> 00:36:48,907
I can live with that.

733
00:36:51,543 --> 00:36:55,313
You never did get
my humor.

734
00:36:57,850 --> 00:37:00,852
There's a chance your hearing
won't be completely gone.

735
00:37:04,857 --> 00:37:07,324
How much of a chance?

736
00:37:07,359 --> 00:37:09,727
A small one.

737
00:37:09,761 --> 00:37:12,563
<i>But a chance.</i>

738
00:37:20,839 --> 00:37:23,206
I'm--I'm refusing treatment.

739
00:37:25,510 --> 00:37:31,114
You don't know how hard
things are already for me.

740
00:37:31,148 --> 00:37:34,584
I can't handle any more.

741
00:37:38,288 --> 00:37:41,256
I can't.

742
00:37:43,593 --> 00:37:47,796
Oh, hi.

743
00:37:47,831 --> 00:37:50,465
I'm here to apologize.

744
00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:53,468
<i>I could have handled</i>
<i>the news with more...</i>

745
00:37:53,503 --> 00:37:58,139
Aplomb?

746
00:37:58,173 --> 00:38:00,875
I have a son.
That's great news.

747
00:38:00,910 --> 00:38:04,445
What else did she
tell you to say?

748
00:38:04,479 --> 00:38:07,882
You're not a lunatic,
you're not a mistake.

749
00:38:11,519 --> 00:38:15,288
I never liked your <i>friend...</i>
My father.

750
00:38:15,322 --> 00:38:18,859
Well, he could be
a bit intense at times.

751
00:38:18,893 --> 00:38:22,128
But unlike you,
I did respect him.

752
00:38:24,766 --> 00:38:26,732
Do you respect your mother?

753
00:38:30,704 --> 00:38:32,772
Well, we do have that
in common.

754
00:38:32,806 --> 00:38:35,841
And we all love her.

755
00:38:35,876 --> 00:38:38,277
So we don't have
much choice, do we?

756
00:38:40,981 --> 00:38:45,750
Son, see you
at dinner.

757
00:39:02,033 --> 00:39:04,568
Will, it's me.

758
00:39:07,005 --> 00:39:08,973
Let me guess.

759
00:39:09,007 --> 00:39:10,674
The doctor who thinks
I'm an ass

760
00:39:10,709 --> 00:39:13,276
wants you to convince me
to live.

761
00:39:13,311 --> 00:39:15,712
Yes.

762
00:39:20,918 --> 00:39:24,553
It won't work.
I know.

763
00:39:26,724 --> 00:39:29,892
So I won't.

764
00:39:29,927 --> 00:39:33,829
Wow.
You're that angry?

765
00:39:33,863 --> 00:39:39,467
I've made enough decisions
for you.

766
00:39:39,502 --> 00:39:42,137
This is your life.

767
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:46,508
Why'd you come back?

768
00:39:49,377 --> 00:39:53,748
Because I love you.

769
00:39:53,782 --> 00:39:57,351
And I want to be with you
for as long as I can.

770
00:40:00,656 --> 00:40:03,023
Melissa, I'm so scared.

771
00:40:03,057 --> 00:40:06,592
Me too.

772
00:40:12,299 --> 00:40:14,400
I'll always love you.

773
00:40:19,039 --> 00:40:22,174
Even if I was deaf?

774
00:40:22,208 --> 00:40:25,610
Even if anything.

775
00:40:42,861 --> 00:40:44,762
Is it working?

776
00:40:44,797 --> 00:40:47,065
He's still very ill,

777
00:40:47,099 --> 00:40:49,533
but if he keeps responding
the way he has been,

778
00:40:49,568 --> 00:40:52,803
he should be fine.

779
00:40:52,837 --> 00:40:56,206
And his hearing?
It's gone.

780
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:59,475
<i>We don't know yet</i>
<i>if it'll be permanent.</i>

781
00:41:07,417 --> 00:41:10,920
Melissa?
Is that you?

782
00:41:10,954 --> 00:41:11,921
We've been squeezing
his hand,

783
00:41:11,955 --> 00:41:13,756
once for yes,
twice for no.

784
00:41:20,030 --> 00:41:23,198
Can I ask you something?

785
00:41:23,232 --> 00:41:25,934
I completely understand
if you squeeze no.

786
00:41:32,574 --> 00:41:34,743
Will you marry me?

787
00:41:45,019 --> 00:41:46,453
Don't leave me hanging,
now.

788
00:41:46,487 --> 00:41:48,756
Yes.

789
00:41:48,790 --> 00:41:50,824
Yes! Of course, yes!

790
00:41:50,859 --> 00:41:54,628
I--I heard that.
You said yes, right?

791
00:41:54,662 --> 00:41:57,730
Yes!
You said y--

792
00:42:07,141 --> 00:42:09,942
How long are you gonna wait
until you tell me?

793
00:42:09,977 --> 00:42:12,343
I thought we already had
the Santa Claus talk.

794
00:42:12,378 --> 00:42:16,214
You don't think
I saw you steal Thomas' fork

795
00:42:16,249 --> 00:42:18,316
from the restaurant?
Why would I do that?

796
00:42:18,350 --> 00:42:19,484
For his DNA.

797
00:42:19,518 --> 00:42:24,856
That's...That's...

798
00:42:24,891 --> 00:42:27,291
Very observant of you.

799
00:42:27,325 --> 00:42:29,459
See, you're more me
than you pretend.

800
00:42:29,494 --> 00:42:31,829
You had to know for sure.

801
00:42:31,863 --> 00:42:35,365
So you needed proof.

802
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:37,234
The fact that
you haven't told me

803
00:42:37,269 --> 00:42:41,272
can only mean...

804
00:42:41,306 --> 00:42:43,339
He isn't your father either.

805
00:42:51,381 --> 00:42:52,748
I'm sorry.

806
00:42:56,153 --> 00:42:57,486
You know what that means.

807
00:42:57,521 --> 00:42:59,321
Your mom's a slut.

808
00:42:59,355 --> 00:43:02,357
That...

809
00:43:02,391 --> 00:43:07,557
And...she's not as boring
as I thought she was.
