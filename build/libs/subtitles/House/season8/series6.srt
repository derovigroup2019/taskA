Yeah, I got that from
the line in his chart

179
00:07:20,053 --> 00:07:21,554

186

I know I'm not any good
at being a clown yet,

light up,

00:08:19,716 --> 00:08:22,518
that's how my dad made me feel

but always broke
and always on the road.

208

Plenty of time to make money.

Is, uh, is this because
of the medication?

215

Is it normal?

216
00:09:11,769 --> 00:09:15,805
It's not normal,

"Her"?

221
00:09:33,164 --> 00:09:37,401
Surely this bundle of fun

It's Sophie.

The other one's Sophia.

<i>(Taub) That's not a symptom</i>
<i>of Burkitt's.</i>

693
00:30:31,737 --> 00:30:34,305
Are you saying it's--
it's Burkitt's.

694
00:30:34,373 --> 00:30:35,740
Prep him for chemo.

695
00:30:48,554 --> 00:30:49,721
I think you should
give House permission

696
00:30:49,788 --> 00:30:51,055
to go to Atlantic City.

697
00:30:51,123 --> 00:30:53,792
We'll stop by
the rheumatology conference.

698
00:30:53,859 --> 00:30:56,027
Everyone's covered.
No.

699
00:30:56,095 --> 00:30:59,898
The guy has earned the right
to go to one boxing match.

700
00:30:59,965 --> 00:31:01,666
He's done everything
you've asked--

701
00:31:01,734 --> 00:31:03,468
funded and staffed
his own department.

702
00:31:03,536 --> 00:31:05,870

as a traffic law.

703
00:31:05,938 --> 00:31:08,273
You're right.

704
00:31:08,341 --> 00:31:10,409
So you'll let him go?

705
00:31:10,477 --> 00:31:12,111
No.

707
00:31:14,448 --> 00:31:15,949
I'd love to go myself,

708
00:31:16,017 --> 00:31:17,617
which is kind of
why I have to stop him.

709
00:31:17,685 --> 00:31:20,087
My job is to be the jerk.

710
00:31:20,155 --> 00:31:22,390
House has to believe that
I have authority over him.

711
00:31:22,458 --> 00:31:24,759
He can't function
under someone's thumb.

712
00:31:24,827 --> 00:31:26,895
I know, which means
you can't go either.

713
00:31:31,066 --> 00:31:33,601
Your job is to be
his friend,

714
00:31:33,668 --> 00:31:35,236
to stay here
and sit with him

715
00:31:35,303 --> 00:31:36,537
and watch the fight
on pay-per-view

716
00:31:36,605 --> 00:31:37,505

717
00:31:37,573 --> 00:31:39,073
If we both do our jobs,

718
00:31:39,141 --> 00:31:41,508
we might actually get him
through his parole.

719
00:31:45,347 --> 00:31:47,082

00:31:54,424 --> 00:31:55,824
No lawyers.

723
00:31:55,892 --> 00:31:58,594
Phil had something that
he would like to say,

724
00:31:58,661 --> 00:32:02,030
so I thought that he should
say it in person.

725
00:32:02,098 --> 00:32:04,834
It was wrong of me
to confront you

726
00:32:04,901 --> 00:32:06,302
about taking Rachel
to Portland.

727
00:32:06,370 --> 00:32:09,339
You don't want to move
to Portland?

728
00:32:09,407 --> 00:32:12,509
Of course I do, but this is
about your daughter too

729
00:32:12,577 --> 00:32:14,044

something like this

730

without your support.

731
00:32:15,881 --> 00:32:19,082
So you guys are trying
to manipulate me

732
00:32:19,150 --> 00:32:21,150

good cop/good cop?

733
00:32:21,218 --> 00:32:24,887

you think of me?

working for House.

735
00:32:28,426 --> 00:32:30,426
I will see you this weekend
when you pick up Sophie.

736
00:32:30,494 --> 00:32:32,062
Sophia.

737
00:32:32,130 --> 00:32:33,730
We actually started
calling her Sophie.

738
00:32:33,798 --> 00:32:34,731
Yeah.

739
00:32:34,799 --> 00:32:37,100
Great.

740
00:32:38,535 --> 00:32:39,702

743

I'm faint. I've been
gaining more weight.

Those awful anti-diabetic

00:33:13,874 --> 00:33:15,442
do they contain bok choy?

752
00:33:15,509 --> 00:33:17,110
A pound of it.
Every day.

753
00:33:17,177 --> 00:33:22,616
Bok choy has glucosinolates
which inhibit thyroid function

754
00:33:22,683 --> 00:33:24,651
and account
for all your symptoms.

755
00:33:24,719 --> 00:33:27,054
So this isn't diabetes?

756
00:33:27,122 --> 00:33:29,991
You have a bad case
of irony.

Hey, maybe I don't have my
father's crummy genes after all.

760

You should be okay.

00:39:21,396 --> 00:39:22,930
Evening.

866
00:39:27,701 --> 00:39:33,272
Clever tactic, pretending
you're not interested anymore.

867
00:39:33,340 --> 00:39:36,909
How could that possibly work
as a tactic?

868
00:39:36,977 --> 00:39:39,012
The fact is, once I saw
those incompletes,

869
00:39:39,079 --> 00:39:40,814
I knew your parents
screwed you up.

870
00:39:40,882 --> 00:39:44,618
The details
are just gravy.

871
00:39:44,686 --> 00:39:47,188
You're wrong.

872
00:39:47,256 --> 00:39:50,825
The only evidence you have
is proof of something else.

873
00:39:52,461 --> 00:39:55,163
I ran away from home.

874
00:39:57,499 --> 00:40:00,435
Because you had
lousy parents.

875
00:40:00,502 --> 00:40:04,004
Because I didn't.

876
00:40:04,072 --> 00:40:07,340
All my friends' parents
were divorced

877
00:40:07,408 --> 00:40:09,142
or having affairs

878
00:40:09,210 --> 00:40:13,880
or barely knew
their kids' birthdays.

879
00:40:13,948 --> 00:40:18,151
You envied
their dysfunction?

880
00:40:18,219 --> 00:40:22,790
I-I thought it made them
deeper somehow.

881
00:40:26,328 --> 00:40:28,397
It was stupid.

882
00:40:28,464 --> 00:40:32,068
I hitchhiked to Manhattan,
moved in with an older guy.

883
00:40:32,135 --> 00:40:35,405
In two months,
I came running home.

884
00:40:35,473 --> 00:40:39,709
It took my parents years
to get over it.

885
00:40:39,776 --> 00:40:42,878
That's when you
started to excel.

886
00:40:42,946 --> 00:40:46,381
You were making it up
to them.

887
00:40:46,448 --> 00:40:50,117
Your parents screwed you up
by not screwing you up.

888
00:40:50,185 --> 00:40:52,320
How does briefly
wishing I was screwed up

889
00:40:52,387 --> 00:40:55,088
make me screwed up?

890
00:40:55,156 --> 00:40:57,023
It's normal to be
screwed up.

891
00:40:57,091 --> 00:41:00,494
It's really screwed up
to romanticize it.

892
00:41:00,561 --> 00:41:04,764
I guess that's why you wanted
to work with prisoners.

893
00:41:04,832 --> 00:41:08,501
It's why I wanted
to work with you.

894
00:41:12,273 --> 00:41:14,207
It was a tactic.

895
00:41:23,952 --> 00:41:24,986
[Knocks]

896
00:41:29,824 --> 00:41:31,658
[Clears his throat]

897
00:41:31,726 --> 00:41:33,461
Chris.

898
00:41:33,528 --> 00:41:34,595
<i>Yeah.</i>

899
00:41:34,662 --> 00:41:37,164
I need to talk to you
and Phil.

900
00:41:39,334 --> 00:41:42,470
Is everything okay?

901
00:41:42,537 --> 00:41:44,171
Yeah.

902
00:41:54,783 --> 00:41:57,518
I can't let you move.

903
00:41:57,586 --> 00:41:58,986
You drove all the way
out here

904
00:41:59,054 --> 00:42:01,222
just to tell us
what you already told us.

905
00:42:01,289 --> 00:42:04,392
I'm sorry.

906
00:42:12,667 --> 00:42:14,201
[Knock on door]

907
00:42:14,269 --> 00:42:15,569
<i>(Wilson)</i>
<i>House, open up.</i>

908
00:42:15,637 --> 00:42:17,138
<i>I don't want to miss</i>
<i>the opening bell.</i>

909
00:42:21,209 --> 00:42:23,043
House?

910
00:42:33,553 --> 00:42:36,856
<i>(Jim Lampley) ...Telecast, we expect</i>
<i>an electric atmosphere</i>

911
00:42:36,924 --> 00:42:39,158
<i>in the arena and a sellout</i>
<i>crowd of about 10,000</i>

912
00:42:39,226 --> 00:42:41,895
<i>for Rubio versus Santos,</i>
<i>two great fighters</i>

913
00:42:41,963 --> 00:42:43,631
<i>with illustrious careers</i>

914
00:42:43,698 --> 00:42:45,499
<i>who might have been expected</i>
<i>to meet a long time ago.</i>

915
00:42:45,567 --> 00:42:47,869
<i>As for Santos,</i>
<i>his handlers tell us</i>

916
00:42:47,937 --> 00:42:49,104
<i>that he's done more roadwork</i>

917
00:42:49,171 --> 00:42:50,739
<i>than at any time</i>
<i>in his career,</i>

918
00:42:50,807 --> 00:42:54,109
<i>hoping to prove tonight that</i>
<i>he can box for 12 full rounds.</i>

919
00:42:54,177 --> 00:42:57,246
<i>Significant because Santos</i>
<i>hasn't heard the final bell</i>

920
00:42:57,313 --> 00:42:59,448
<i>in more than six years.</i>

921
00:42:59,516 --> 00:43:01,483
<i>He comes in with</i>
<i>11 straight knockout wins</i>

922
00:43:01,551 --> 00:43:04,386
<i>and we saw how a power puncher</i>
<i>with a left hook</i>

923
00:43:04,454 --> 00:43:06,722
<i>was able to cut Rubio</i>
<i>over the right eye</i>

924
00:43:06,790 --> 00:43:08,457
<i>in the tenth round</i>
<i>of that last fight.</i>
