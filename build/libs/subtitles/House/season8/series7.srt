00:00:15,252 --> 00:00:18,730
"The Patuxent River
Naval Air Station near D.C.

2
00:00:18,731 --> 00:00:24,402
<i>was commissioned in 1943</i>
<i>by John McCain's grandfather."</i>

3
00:00:24,470 --> 00:00:26,505
I'm thinking of going
hang gliding.

4
00:00:26,572 --> 00:00:28,465
Pax River is,
like, completely flat.

5
00:00:28,533 --> 00:00:31,519
Think that's why they tested
the V-22 Osprey there.

6
00:00:35,075 --> 00:00:37,887
I like naval stuff.

7
00:00:37,955 --> 00:00:39,155
I like their oranges
and lint.

8
00:00:39,223 --> 00:00:40,189
<i>What looks</i>
<i>like kidney disease,</i>

9
00:00:40,256 --> 00:00:41,658
<i>but isn't?</i>

10
00:00:41,726 --> 00:00:43,800
And where's Chase?
<i>Root canal and Berger's.</i>

11
00:00:43,868 --> 00:00:44,934
The first one
was regarding Chase.

12
00:00:45,002 --> 00:00:46,473
Root canal,
if done correctly,

13
00:00:46,540 --> 00:00:48,910
doesn't look like
kidney disease.

14
00:00:48,978 --> 00:00:50,812
Got a case for you.

15
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:52,785
Smells funny.

16
00:00:52,852 --> 00:00:54,921
Patient had an idiopathic
anaphylactic reaction.

17
00:00:54,989 --> 00:00:56,224
It stumped two E.R. Docs

18
00:00:56,292 --> 00:00:57,627
and an immunologist
from Johns Hopkins.

19
00:00:57,695 --> 00:00:59,594
Patient went from
asymptomatic to fried kidneys

20
00:00:59,662 --> 00:01:00,597
in less than a year.

21
00:01:00,665 --> 00:01:02,200
Stumped three internists

22
00:01:02,267 --> 00:01:03,834
and a department chair
from Harvard.

23
00:01:03,902 --> 00:01:05,738
14-year-old girl,
intermittent attacks.

24
00:01:05,806 --> 00:01:10,144
Four-year-old boy,
consistently at death's door.

25
00:01:17,422 --> 00:01:18,255
This patient died
five years ago.

26
00:01:21,459 --> 00:01:23,225
I didn't say which side
of the door he was on.

27
00:01:26,396 --> 00:01:28,830
The fact that he's dead
makes it more interesting.

28
00:01:28,898 --> 00:01:31,165
Four-year-olds
do not die of Berger's.

29
00:01:35,903 --> 00:01:37,537
I thought
it was relevant.

30
00:01:37,604 --> 00:01:39,238
Death is a consequence,
not a symptom.

31
00:01:39,306 --> 00:01:44,845
If it's not a symptom,
it's not relevant.

32
00:01:44,913 --> 00:01:46,148
<i>Shouldn't we be</i>
<i>trying to maximize</i>

33
00:01:46,216 --> 00:01:47,950
what we can save here?

34
00:01:48,017 --> 00:01:49,918
14-year-old,
your freedom, our asses?

35
00:01:53,756 --> 00:01:56,425
Right...
Save your asses.

[Massive Attack's <i>Teardrop]</i>

38
00:02:07,496 --> 00:02:29,888
? ?

39
00:02:31,728 --> 00:02:33,796
She was in a car accident
when she was two.

40
00:02:33,864 --> 00:02:36,365
She only had minor injuries,
but her father died.

41
00:02:36,433 --> 00:02:38,400
That was 12 years ago.
You think that's pertinent?

42
00:02:38,468 --> 00:02:40,435
No, I think
it's sad.

43
00:02:40,503 --> 00:02:45,306
She got sick in the middle
of her 14th birthday party.

44
00:02:45,374 --> 00:02:46,974
Which is sad
and pertinent.

45
00:02:47,042 --> 00:02:48,309
Maybe she was opening
a present

46
00:02:48,377 --> 00:02:49,777
that triggered
the reaction.

47
00:02:49,845 --> 00:02:51,645
- Where's House?
- Pissing contest with Foreman.

48
00:02:51,713 --> 00:02:53,347
Last thing she ate
was strawberry cake,

49
00:02:53,415 --> 00:02:55,616
<i>but allergy tests</i>
<i>for everything were negative.</i>

50
00:02:55,684 --> 00:02:56,784
Do you like your dentist?

51
00:02:56,852 --> 00:02:58,352
I'm still going
to my pediatric one.

52
00:02:58,420 --> 00:03:00,854
What's your
dentist's name?

53
00:03:00,922 --> 00:03:02,323
Williams.

54
00:03:02,391 --> 00:03:03,858
<i>What if it's not</i>
<i>an allergic reaction?</i>

55
00:03:03,926 --> 00:03:05,193
<i>Hereditary angioedema</i>

56
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:06,494
or systemic mastocytosis

57
00:03:06,562 --> 00:03:07,595
could mimic anaphylaxis.

58
00:03:07,663 --> 00:03:09,230
You're not sure
of his name?

59
00:03:09,298 --> 00:03:11,366
You just saw him
this morning.

60
00:03:11,434 --> 00:03:13,202
His assistant's name
is Angie.

61
00:03:13,270 --> 00:03:14,169
<i>Her home number is--</i>

62
00:03:14,237 --> 00:03:15,571
Normal complement studies.

63
00:03:15,639 --> 00:03:16,739
<i>No skin lesions.</i>

64
00:03:16,806 --> 00:03:18,373
You had a manicure.

65
00:03:18,441 --> 00:03:20,209
This is fresh!
You weren't at the dentist.

66
00:03:20,276 --> 00:03:21,677
Why would you
lie about that?

67
00:03:21,744 --> 00:03:23,612
To avoid having
this conversation.

68
00:03:23,679 --> 00:03:24,846
<i>Elevated BP.</i>
<i>What about pheochromocytoma?</i>

69
00:03:24,914 --> 00:03:26,448
Or an anaphylactoid
reaction,

70
00:03:26,515 --> 00:03:28,516
which could be triggered
by certain opioids.

71
00:03:28,584 --> 00:03:30,084
You've had your hair cut
three times since I've met you.

72
00:03:30,152 --> 00:03:32,053
You can't be embarrassed
about a manicure.

73
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:33,621
There's gotta be
a deeper reason.

74
00:03:33,689 --> 00:03:34,755
Did House
give you homework?

75
00:03:34,823 --> 00:03:35,856
She's not on any meds.

76
00:03:35,924 --> 00:03:37,224
Haven't you heard?
Everybody lies.

77
00:03:37,292 --> 00:03:38,559
And the tox screen
was clean.

78
00:03:38,626 --> 00:03:41,394
<i>Feel free to jump in</i>
<i>at any time.</i>

79
00:03:43,498 --> 00:03:44,998
We'll check
catecholamines for pheo

80
00:03:45,066 --> 00:03:46,934
and run an expanded
opioid panel.

81
00:03:47,002 --> 00:03:48,469
You see what the patient
says about drug use

82
00:03:48,537 --> 00:03:50,171
when her mother's
out of the room.

83
00:03:53,742 --> 00:03:55,209
No, never.

84
00:03:55,277 --> 00:03:56,577
Nobody's here
to bust you, iris.

85
00:03:56,645 --> 00:03:58,579
- We just need to know if--
- No, I already told you.

86
00:03:58,647 --> 00:04:02,317
I just take vitamin C
sometimes.

87
00:04:02,384 --> 00:04:05,086
What exactly were you doing
when you had your reaction?

88
00:04:05,154 --> 00:04:09,191
Opening a birthday present.
The Magic 8 Ball.

89
00:04:09,259 --> 00:04:11,360
The joke gift,
not the cocaine.

90
00:04:11,428 --> 00:04:12,494
Is that it?

91
00:04:14,231 --> 00:04:16,932
Certain drugs could
explain her reaction.

92
00:04:19,903 --> 00:04:22,205
What kind of drugs?

93
00:04:22,272 --> 00:04:23,539
What kind
did you have in mind?

94
00:04:26,076 --> 00:04:28,511
Iris has always been
a moody girl.

95
00:04:28,578 --> 00:04:31,513
And now that she's a teenager,
it's gotten worse.

96
00:04:31,581 --> 00:04:34,182
So for the past few months
I've been...

97
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:35,816
giving something
to relax her.

98
00:04:35,884 --> 00:04:39,086
Diazepam.
I tell her it's vitamin C.

99
00:04:39,154 --> 00:04:42,556
Being normal
is very important to Iris.

100
00:04:42,624 --> 00:04:45,425
She couldn't handle the thought
of being on meds.

101
00:04:45,493 --> 00:04:47,361
Anti-anxiety medications
would explain it.

102
00:04:47,428 --> 00:04:49,897
If we keep her off,

103
00:04:49,964 --> 00:04:52,299
she'll be moody,
but healthy.

104
00:04:55,503 --> 00:04:56,570
Or it's something else.

105
00:05:02,977 --> 00:05:05,279
I need to DDx
a patient with you.

106
00:05:05,347 --> 00:05:06,547
I thought you had
a team for that.

107
00:05:06,615 --> 00:05:07,648
<i>According to Foreman,</i>

108
00:05:07,716 --> 00:05:09,016
they're only
for DDxing people

109
00:05:09,084 --> 00:05:12,053
who are still alive.

110
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:14,589
You have a dead patient?

111
00:05:14,657 --> 00:05:17,025
Bigotry is boring
when we add modifiers.

112
00:05:17,092 --> 00:05:19,861
I don't see creed,
color, pulse.

113
00:05:19,928 --> 00:05:21,396
Foreman will find out
you're taking this case,

114
00:05:21,464 --> 00:05:22,564
and he'll bust you.

115
00:05:22,631 --> 00:05:23,598
But you know that,

116
00:05:23,666 --> 00:05:26,768
<i>which means...</i>

117
00:05:26,836 --> 00:05:30,038
You want to go back
to jail...

118
00:05:30,106 --> 00:05:32,040
<i>Because it's</i>
<i>the one place</i>

119
00:05:32,108 --> 00:05:35,744
you're unable to indulge
your self-destructive habits.

120
00:05:35,812 --> 00:05:37,746
<i>Yeah, it's much</i>
<i>more likely that I'm</i>

121
00:05:37,814 --> 00:05:39,014
taking this case

122
00:05:39,082 --> 00:05:40,582
because I miss showering
with Cro-Magnons

123
00:05:40,650 --> 00:05:43,719
than that I actually happen
to find it interesting.

124
00:05:43,786 --> 00:05:45,988
Four-year-old kid.

125
00:05:46,055 --> 00:05:48,590
His kidneys died,
they transfused.

126
00:05:48,658 --> 00:05:52,061
His lungs died.
He died.

127
00:05:52,129 --> 00:05:53,529
Have you seen
<i>Bride of the Monster?</i>

128
00:05:53,597 --> 00:05:55,164
I just got
the Ed Wood box set.

129
00:05:55,232 --> 00:05:56,966
What if the chicken
was the egg?

130
00:05:57,033 --> 00:05:58,634
What if the lung involvement
came first?

131
00:05:58,702 --> 00:06:00,002
I don't really
care about the movie.

132
00:06:00,070 --> 00:06:01,471
I just don't want
to indulge your--

133
00:06:01,538 --> 00:06:02,572
Lupus.

134
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:05,041
Because this is
a bad idea, House.

135
00:06:05,109 --> 00:06:06,910
If the kid had a rash

136
00:06:06,978 --> 00:06:10,180
or some circulation issue...

137
00:06:10,248 --> 00:06:11,482
Damn!

138
00:06:13,151 --> 00:06:14,352
I just realized I'm late

139
00:06:14,419 --> 00:06:16,487
for my anger management
class.

140
00:06:20,292 --> 00:06:22,160
<i>Traffic, for sure.</i>

141
00:06:22,227 --> 00:06:23,961
<i>Taxes.</i>
<i>Definitely taxes.</i>

142
00:06:24,029 --> 00:06:25,596
Spoiled grandchildren.

143
00:06:25,664 --> 00:06:26,730
Platitudes.

144
00:06:30,001 --> 00:06:31,334
Any others?

145
00:06:31,402 --> 00:06:33,403
And I lose my temper
when someone suggests

146
00:06:33,471 --> 00:06:35,772
that a handful of pop-psych
catch phrases

147
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:37,974
can control
our most seminal,

148
00:06:38,042 --> 00:06:40,744
<i>intractable,</i>
<i>and natural reaction</i>

149
00:06:40,812 --> 00:06:42,179
to a dead child.

150
00:06:45,017 --> 00:06:47,552
Am I right, Emory?

151
00:06:51,758 --> 00:06:54,460
I don't think Emory
wants to share right now.

152
00:06:54,528 --> 00:06:55,328
<i>They blew it,</i>
<i>didn't they?</i>

153
00:06:55,395 --> 00:06:57,330
They missed your son's rash.

154
00:06:57,397 --> 00:06:58,731
A faint one,
on his cheek.

155
00:06:58,799 --> 00:07:00,867
He didn't have a rash.

156
00:07:00,934 --> 00:07:03,235
I think we should talk about
Lena's grandchildren.

157
00:07:03,303 --> 00:07:04,436
They're alive.

158
00:07:04,504 --> 00:07:06,405
- Was he sensitive to sunlight?
- No.

159
00:07:06,472 --> 00:07:08,106
- Greg...
- Cold fingers and toes?

160
00:07:08,174 --> 00:07:09,908
No!

161
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:20,918
Wegener's granulomatosis.

162
00:07:20,986 --> 00:07:22,186
I need to examine
your son.

163
00:07:22,254 --> 00:07:25,456
You're a bit late
for that...you ass.

164
00:07:25,524 --> 00:07:27,492
With you
and your wife's consent,

165
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:29,261
we can get
an exhumation order.

166
00:07:29,329 --> 00:07:31,664
Find out
what killed him.

167
00:07:31,731 --> 00:07:33,199
Ex-wife.

168
00:07:33,266 --> 00:07:35,301
And you'll never
get her consent.

169
00:07:35,369 --> 00:07:36,969
She's moved on--
new hub, new kid.

170
00:07:37,037 --> 00:07:39,205
She wants nothing to do
with Drew's death.

171
00:07:39,273 --> 00:07:40,540
Or me.

172
00:07:43,644 --> 00:07:46,379
You're angry because
your kid died.

173
00:07:46,447 --> 00:07:47,513
More than that,

174
00:07:47,581 --> 00:07:51,050
because you don't
have an answer.

175
00:07:51,118 --> 00:07:52,985
People need answers.

176
00:08:02,362 --> 00:08:04,730
He's in a crypt
at St. Jude's cemetery.

177
00:08:08,501 --> 00:08:11,303
You feeling any pain
or cramping here?

178
00:08:11,371 --> 00:08:12,338
A bit.

179
00:08:12,405 --> 00:08:15,074
But not just there,
um...

180
00:08:15,141 --> 00:08:16,776
Here.

181
00:08:16,843 --> 00:08:18,177
<i>Breast tenderness.</i>

182
00:08:18,245 --> 00:08:20,880
Have you been having
regular periods, Iris?

183
00:08:20,948 --> 00:08:22,449
Not really.

184
00:08:23,585 --> 00:08:25,119
What is it?

185
00:08:25,187 --> 00:08:26,754
I think we should
run a pregnancy test.

186
00:08:26,822 --> 00:08:29,057
Iris isn't
sexually active.

187
00:08:29,124 --> 00:08:31,092
She doesn't even
have a boyfriend.

188
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:33,161
Pregnancy would explain
all of her symptoms.

189
00:08:33,229 --> 00:08:34,396
Can even cause
some unpredictable

190
00:08:34,464 --> 00:08:35,764
<i>allergic reactions.</i>

191
00:08:35,832 --> 00:08:39,535
How can I be pregnant
if I've never even had sex?

192
00:08:39,603 --> 00:08:40,903
We just need
a drop of blood.

193
00:08:44,106 --> 00:08:44,940
What's the matter?

194
00:08:45,007 --> 00:08:46,408
<i>My--</i>

195
00:08:46,475 --> 00:08:48,576
my arms.

196
00:08:48,644 --> 00:08:51,045
I can't feel my arms.

197
00:08:57,919 --> 00:08:59,586
At this rate,

198
00:08:59,654 --> 00:09:02,590
I'm gonna need to pick out
a plot for myself.

199
00:09:02,658 --> 00:09:04,692
Thanks to your
generous donation,

200
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:05,960
you have all morning.

201
00:09:06,028 --> 00:09:07,929
More like 13 minutes.

202
00:09:09,665 --> 00:09:11,867
Before we proceed
any further, Doctor,

203
00:09:11,934 --> 00:09:14,637
I'd like inquire
as to exactly what procedure

204
00:09:14,704 --> 00:09:16,706
you intend to perform
on the remains.

205
00:09:16,773 --> 00:09:18,975
Have you ever heard
of the North American

206
00:09:19,043 --> 00:09:21,311
Man/Dead Boy
Love Association?

207
00:09:23,346 --> 00:09:26,615
I consider these grounds
to be a holy place,

208
00:09:26,683 --> 00:09:29,718
and I would ask you to observe
them with due decorum.

209
00:09:29,785 --> 00:09:32,320
So you're taking bribes
to plunder graves,

210
00:09:32,388 --> 00:09:33,688
and I need to show respect.

211
00:09:37,392 --> 00:09:39,059
I think they got
the cause of death wrong.

212
00:09:39,127 --> 00:09:41,928
And if I find a hole
in the cartilage of his nose,

213
00:09:41,996 --> 00:09:43,129
right about here,

214
00:09:43,197 --> 00:09:44,497
then it means I'm right.

215
00:09:48,169 --> 00:09:49,703
Please be respectful.

216
00:09:55,210 --> 00:09:57,644
I prepared the sarcophagus
for you.

217
00:09:59,914 --> 00:10:02,183
Thank you, Igor.

218
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:03,718
It's Milton.

219
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,936
You owe me
a new pair of pants.

220
00:10:56,774 --> 00:10:59,476
<i>She</i> is <i>pregnant.</i>
<i>Test came back positive.</i>

221
00:10:59,544 --> 00:11:03,113
So...she lost
the use of her arms

222
00:11:03,181 --> 00:11:04,814
and her innocence.

223
00:11:04,882 --> 00:11:06,583
A vengeful God?

224
00:11:06,650 --> 00:11:09,352
Or...

225
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:10,987
<i>Cerebral tumor.</i>

226
00:11:11,054 --> 00:11:12,421
<i>Vasculitis.</i>

227
00:11:12,489 --> 00:11:13,489
<i>Ms.</i>

228
00:11:21,464 --> 00:11:22,931
I gather from the silence

229
00:11:22,999 --> 00:11:23,899
<i>that Chase isn't there.</i>

230
00:11:23,967 --> 00:11:25,201
Nope, I'm here.

231
00:11:25,268 --> 00:11:26,469
Where are you?

232
00:11:26,536 --> 00:11:27,937
<i>"Nowhere"...</i>

233
00:11:28,005 --> 00:11:29,806
<i>He said cryptically.</i>

234
00:11:29,874 --> 00:11:33,844
<i>I assume you concur</i>
<i>with the diagnosis.</i>

235
00:11:33,912 --> 00:11:35,446
Absolutely.

236
00:11:35,514 --> 00:11:37,682
<i>Even though</i>
<i>there are three diagnoses?</i>

237
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:39,551
<i>And MS and vasculitis</i>

238
00:11:39,618 --> 00:11:42,755
<i>usually get better</i>
<i>with pregnancy.</i>

239
00:11:42,822 --> 00:11:44,690
Yeah, I was saying
I agreed with the other one.

240
00:11:44,757 --> 00:11:46,225
He's had
his eyebrows waxed.

241
00:11:46,292 --> 00:11:47,426
<i>I met a woman</i>

242
00:11:47,493 --> 00:11:48,794
<i>who likes</i>
<i>her men well groomed.</i>

243
00:11:48,861 --> 00:11:50,496
All over?

244
00:11:52,732 --> 00:11:54,667
I assume,
from the silence,

245
00:11:54,734 --> 00:11:57,469
that Chase has had
a Brazilian.

246
00:11:57,537 --> 00:11:59,505
- Cool.
- Interesting.

247
00:11:59,573 --> 00:12:00,439
Ouch.

248
00:12:07,913 --> 00:12:11,416
Question is...
is this really about a woman?

249
00:12:11,484 --> 00:12:12,884
<i>Or is it about</i>
<i>something more profound?</i>

250
00:12:12,952 --> 00:12:14,786
Another question is,
could the paresthesia

251
00:12:14,854 --> 00:12:16,254
be caused by an STD?

252
00:12:16,322 --> 00:12:20,759
<i>HIV-related</i>
<i>mononeuritis multiplex.</i>

253
00:12:20,827 --> 00:12:23,761
I gather from the silence

254
00:12:23,829 --> 00:12:26,364
that either you all
agree with Chase

255
00:12:26,431 --> 00:12:29,199
or you're just staring
at his emasculated brow.

256
00:12:29,267 --> 00:12:32,302
In either case,
test for HIV

257
00:12:32,370 --> 00:12:34,238
and do an MRI
to rule out tumors.

258
00:12:36,641 --> 00:12:39,109
And check Chase
for testosterone.

259
00:12:58,398 --> 00:13:00,032
<i>Blood work was negative</i>
<i>for HIV.</i>

260
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:03,268
All the money's
on tumor.

261
00:13:03,336 --> 00:13:05,504
How was the Brazilian?

262
00:13:05,571 --> 00:13:07,605
It was fine.
Hurt a bit.

263
00:13:07,673 --> 00:13:08,940
<i>What about</i>
<i>House's theory?</i>

264
00:13:09,007 --> 00:13:10,207
Why'd you really do it?

265
00:13:10,275 --> 00:13:11,309
'Cause I'm vain
and shallow.

266
00:13:11,376 --> 00:13:12,677
And you weren't before?

267
00:13:12,744 --> 00:13:13,978
<i>The girl</i>
<i>I was seeing wasn't.</i>

268
00:13:14,045 --> 00:13:15,045
There's nothing
profound here.

269
00:13:16,214 --> 00:13:17,848
No tumor, either.

270
00:13:17,915 --> 00:13:18,915
It's not her brain.

271
00:13:22,353 --> 00:13:23,720
Everything looks good.

272
00:13:27,225 --> 00:13:28,226
What's the matter?

273
00:13:28,293 --> 00:13:29,627
My arm, it's...

274
00:13:29,695 --> 00:13:30,695
Still nothing?

275
00:13:30,763 --> 00:13:32,030
No, now they're sore.

276
00:13:32,098 --> 00:13:33,432
Paresthesia's gone.

277
00:13:42,745 --> 00:13:44,695
Could the bruising be caused
by a physical trauma?

278
00:13:44,696 --> 00:13:46,797
You think she fell
out of bed, repeatedly?

279
00:13:46,864 --> 00:13:49,266
A blood disorder.
Maybe thrombocytopenia.

280
00:13:49,334 --> 00:13:51,201
A vitamin K deficiency
or scurvy

281
00:13:51,269 --> 00:13:52,369
could explain
bleeding problems,

282
00:13:52,437 --> 00:13:54,238
and pregnancy
could exacerbate it.

283
00:13:54,305 --> 00:13:57,541
Boys, do a home search.
Girls, do lab tests.

284
00:13:57,609 --> 00:14:00,445
I'm pretty sure
that's not sexist.

285
00:14:00,512 --> 00:14:02,313
Where have you been?

286
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:03,948
Picking up dry cleaning.

287
00:14:04,015 --> 00:14:06,784
Filling up the tank.
Violating the dead.

288
00:14:06,852 --> 00:14:08,953
If you don't believe me,
call the monitoring company.

289
00:14:09,021 --> 00:14:10,354
<i>I did.</i>

290
00:14:10,422 --> 00:14:12,924
Unfortunately, the Patuxent
River Naval Air Station

291
00:14:12,991 --> 00:14:15,593
was GPS testing
and disrupted the signal,

292
00:14:15,661 --> 00:14:19,897
at the exact, same 45 minutes
you weren't here.

293
00:14:19,965 --> 00:14:21,933
Well, if I'd known I had
45 minutes of freedom,

294
00:14:22,001 --> 00:14:23,268
I'd have gone hang gliding.

295
00:14:23,335 --> 00:14:24,702
I admire the creativity.

296
00:14:24,770 --> 00:14:27,338
What happens when
the stunt doesn't work?

297
00:14:27,406 --> 00:14:28,706
Think you're gonna have
to pay off a bet?

298
00:14:28,774 --> 00:14:31,108
Think I'm gonna
triple your clinic hours?

299
00:14:31,176 --> 00:14:32,543
I'm gonna call your P.O.,

300
00:14:32,610 --> 00:14:34,678
and you're gonna
go back to jail.

301
00:14:44,289 --> 00:14:45,857
<i>There are Mees' lines</i>
<i>on his fingernails,</i>

302
00:14:45,924 --> 00:14:47,192
<i>so now I'm thinking</i>
<i>heavy metal poisoning.</i>

303
00:14:47,259 --> 00:14:48,860
You're an addict.

304
00:14:48,928 --> 00:14:50,829
And I'm an idiot for thinking
that your addictions

305
00:14:50,897 --> 00:14:53,098
were limited to pills,
anti-social behavior,

306
00:14:53,166 --> 00:14:54,400
and sarcasm.

307
00:14:54,468 --> 00:14:55,701
Sorry.

308
00:14:55,769 --> 00:14:57,436
Vicodin repeating on me.

309
00:14:57,504 --> 00:14:59,538
You're also
addicted to puzzles.

310
00:14:59,606 --> 00:15:01,641
You show all
the classic behaviors.

311
00:15:01,708 --> 00:15:03,876
Lying, neglecting
responsibilities,

312
00:15:03,944 --> 00:15:05,244
and you can't stop,

313
00:15:05,311 --> 00:15:06,846
no matter how devastating
the consequences.

314
00:15:06,913 --> 00:15:09,515
Working on a medical case
is not a parole violation.

315
00:15:09,582 --> 00:15:10,883
It's my job description.

316
00:15:10,951 --> 00:15:12,484
Your job description

317
00:15:12,552 --> 00:15:14,587
is doing what Foreman
tells you to do.

318
00:15:14,655 --> 00:15:16,022
Never mind
<i>Bride of the Monster.</i>

319
00:15:16,090 --> 00:15:19,092
You need to watch
<i>Norma Rae.</i>

320
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:20,728
<i>Before we get started,</i>

321
00:15:20,796 --> 00:15:21,796
<i>I just want</i>
<i>to thank you all</i>

322
00:15:21,863 --> 00:15:23,331
for agreeing to relocate.

323
00:15:23,398 --> 00:15:25,733
Um, I had an appointment
in this part of town,

324
00:15:25,801 --> 00:15:27,335
and I absolutely didn't want
to miss this meeting.

325
00:15:27,403 --> 00:15:28,803
<i>But, uh, thank you.</i>

326
00:15:28,871 --> 00:15:31,106
I'm buying.

327
00:15:31,174 --> 00:15:33,075
Not literally.

328
00:15:33,142 --> 00:15:34,176
Hey, Emory,

329
00:15:34,243 --> 00:15:35,511
should we, uh,
powder our noses?

330
00:15:41,717 --> 00:15:43,385
Hey, did you know
your ex-wife

331
00:15:43,453 --> 00:15:45,621
still lives right
behind this place?

332
00:15:49,192 --> 00:15:50,926
She finishes work at 4:00.

333
00:15:50,994 --> 00:15:52,861
Picks up her new kid
at 4:15.

334
00:15:52,929 --> 00:15:55,931
Gives us about
20 minutes.

335
00:15:55,999 --> 00:15:58,367
I made some calls.

336
00:15:58,434 --> 00:15:59,534
It's amazing what
people will tell you

337
00:15:59,602 --> 00:16:02,571
if you ask
brutally enough.

338
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:04,140
Was that table here?

339
00:16:09,113 --> 00:16:10,681
Some kinds of
pressure-treated wood

340
00:16:10,749 --> 00:16:13,485
can contain arsenic.

341
00:16:13,552 --> 00:16:15,253
We shouldn't be here.

342
00:16:15,321 --> 00:16:17,523
We don't have a choice.

343
00:16:17,590 --> 00:16:20,426
This is the only way
you're gonna get your answer.

344
00:16:20,494 --> 00:16:24,130
<i>Does your ex leave</i>
<i>a spare key anywhere?</i>

345
00:16:24,197 --> 00:16:25,664
How did he look?

346
00:16:34,542 --> 00:16:36,243
Peaceful.

347
00:16:40,048 --> 00:16:41,682
Vitamin K
deficiency's a bust.

348
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:43,150
Fridge has more spinach
and broccoli

349
00:16:43,218 --> 00:16:44,485
than a farmer's market.

350
00:16:44,553 --> 00:16:46,320
The Brazilian...

351
00:16:46,388 --> 00:16:49,090
You said it hurt
"a bit."

352
00:16:49,158 --> 00:16:50,592
You've had one?

353
00:16:50,659 --> 00:16:51,927
More than one,
and you haven't.

354
00:16:51,994 --> 00:16:54,663
They hurt all your bits.

355
00:16:54,731 --> 00:16:56,098
That's my dark secret.

356
00:16:56,166 --> 00:16:58,767
What's yours?

357
00:16:58,835 --> 00:17:00,469
I had the nails
and eyebrows done,

358
00:17:00,537 --> 00:17:01,736
but that's it.

359
00:17:01,804 --> 00:17:04,472
I just needed to create
a distraction, though.

360
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:06,474
I met a TV producer
at a dinner.

361
00:17:06,542 --> 00:17:10,144
She asked me to appear
on the medical segment.

362
00:17:10,211 --> 00:17:12,379
Screen tested it yesterday
and shot it today.

363
00:17:12,447 --> 00:17:14,615
You're a TV Doctor?

364
00:17:14,682 --> 00:17:16,149
It's a one-off.

365
00:17:16,217 --> 00:17:17,517
<i>When's it air?</i>

366
00:17:17,585 --> 00:17:19,853
Two hours ago.

367
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:20,920
Otherwise,
I'd still be lying.

368
00:17:20,988 --> 00:17:23,256
This is what
she was opening

369
00:17:23,324 --> 00:17:25,758
when she had her attack.

370
00:17:25,826 --> 00:17:31,031
Will anyone believe Chase
is an actual Doctor?

371
00:17:31,099 --> 00:17:32,666
"Don't count on it."

372
00:17:36,671 --> 00:17:37,671
Huh.

373
00:17:45,012 --> 00:17:46,380
She does have
a boyfriend.

374
00:17:46,447 --> 00:17:47,814
Love letters.

375
00:17:50,618 --> 00:17:52,352
- <i>Porn.</i>
- The nasty kind.

376
00:17:52,420 --> 00:17:56,757
Torture, rape...
animals.

377
00:17:56,824 --> 00:17:58,625
Sweet kid.

378
00:19:52,643 --> 00:19:54,611
This is all that's left.

379
00:19:56,780 --> 00:19:59,482
One box in the bottom
of a closet.

380
00:20:12,763 --> 00:20:14,330
Ohh.

381
00:20:14,398 --> 00:20:16,032
He used to wear
those stupid things

382
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:17,767
all the time.

383
00:20:17,835 --> 00:20:21,071
Used to have
to pretend I was scared.

384
00:20:21,138 --> 00:20:23,740
Made in the People's
Republic of lead paint.

385
00:20:26,209 --> 00:20:28,244
Back door.

386
00:20:28,312 --> 00:20:30,679
Let's get out
of here first.

387
00:20:30,747 --> 00:20:32,414
We need to catch
the end of our class.

388
00:20:40,222 --> 00:20:42,690
I met him at school.

389
00:20:42,758 --> 00:20:45,560
He was the only boy
that liked me.

390
00:20:45,627 --> 00:20:47,262
It's a little more
than like.

391
00:20:47,329 --> 00:20:50,565
We haven't had sex.

392
00:20:50,633 --> 00:20:52,166
Oh, come on, Iris.
You're pregnant.

393
00:20:52,234 --> 00:20:53,701
So I'm just lying
about everything?

394
00:20:53,769 --> 00:20:55,470
<i>Well, you lied</i>
<i>about the boyfriend.</i>

395
00:20:55,537 --> 00:20:57,706
You obviously
lied about sex

396
00:20:57,773 --> 00:21:00,776
and this...garbage.

397
00:21:00,844 --> 00:21:01,978
They're his.

398
00:21:02,045 --> 00:21:03,246
He can't keep them
at his place.

399
00:21:03,313 --> 00:21:06,283
Well, I'm glad
we could be so accommodating.

400
00:21:06,350 --> 00:21:09,220
What else don't I know?

401
00:21:16,796 --> 00:21:19,831
Honey...

402
00:21:19,899 --> 00:21:21,232
What is it?

403
00:21:24,336 --> 00:21:26,604
He came here last night.

404
00:21:26,672 --> 00:21:29,506
<i>And he told me</i>
<i>I should leave.</i>

405
00:21:29,574 --> 00:21:32,175
But I didn't want to,
and he got mad.

406
00:21:35,179 --> 00:21:36,245
He hit you?

407
00:21:36,313 --> 00:21:37,714
Physical trauma.

408
00:21:37,781 --> 00:21:39,249
<i>Explains the negatives</i>
<i>of the blood disorder.</i>

409
00:21:39,316 --> 00:21:41,318
We should call
the police.

410
00:21:41,386 --> 00:21:42,586
I won't tell them
anything.

411
00:21:43,788 --> 00:21:45,055
That's ridiculous.

412
00:21:45,123 --> 00:21:46,023
<i>He beat you!</i>

413
00:21:51,731 --> 00:21:52,732
What is it?

414
00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:54,534
It's getting hard to see.

415
00:21:54,601 --> 00:21:56,569
What the hell
is happening to me?

416
00:22:04,199 --> 00:22:05,566
Rubbing alcohol,
vinegar.

417
00:22:07,636 --> 00:22:09,036
Not sure what this is.

418
00:22:09,104 --> 00:22:11,672
Aren't there
actual medical tests?

419
00:22:11,740 --> 00:22:14,542
Dead patients usually
get a lower standard of care.

420
00:22:14,609 --> 00:22:16,143
Pink means Lead.

421
00:22:16,211 --> 00:22:18,178
Orange means Mercury.

422
00:22:18,246 --> 00:22:21,415
And rust means Arsenic.

423
00:22:21,482 --> 00:22:22,949
<i>And what's brown mean?</i>

424
00:22:23,017 --> 00:22:24,818
Scotch.

425
00:23:02,456 --> 00:23:06,126
He used to call him
"deezer."

426
00:23:06,193 --> 00:23:09,229
<i>He couldn't say "zebra."</i>

427
00:23:09,297 --> 00:23:10,830
He'd have his own words
for everything.

428
00:23:10,898 --> 00:23:17,671
We called 'em "Drewisms."

429
00:23:17,738 --> 00:23:20,941
How does your ex-wife do it?

430
00:23:21,009 --> 00:23:25,046
How come she's not...
angry and miserable?

431
00:23:28,617 --> 00:23:31,985
She treated it
like it never happened.

432
00:23:32,053 --> 00:23:35,021
She never even cried.

433
00:23:35,089 --> 00:23:38,224
Not even at his funeral.

434
00:23:38,292 --> 00:23:39,359
I was a mess,

435
00:23:39,427 --> 00:23:43,696
and she just
sat there like...

436
00:23:43,764 --> 00:23:45,898
A statue.

437
00:23:52,473 --> 00:23:53,674
We have a problem.

438
00:23:53,742 --> 00:23:55,410
Does it limp?

439
00:24:00,316 --> 00:24:02,885
Why do you care
if he works on two cases?

440
00:24:02,952 --> 00:24:04,220
'Cause next,
it'll be three cases,

441
00:24:04,287 --> 00:24:05,654
then four.

442
00:24:05,722 --> 00:24:07,824
Then animal cases
and ghost cases.

443
00:24:07,892 --> 00:24:09,425
Then animal ghost cases.

444
00:24:09,493 --> 00:24:11,327
Assuming, of course,
we are talking about House.

445
00:24:11,395 --> 00:24:13,929
You're just setting yourself
up to fail.

446
00:24:13,997 --> 00:24:15,397
He has a lot more
to lose than I do,

447
00:24:15,465 --> 00:24:16,898
and he knows that.

448
00:24:16,966 --> 00:24:18,366
He's rational.

449
00:24:18,434 --> 00:24:19,567
No, he's not.

450
00:24:19,635 --> 00:24:21,269
He's the most rational man
I've ever met.

451
00:24:21,336 --> 00:24:22,770
Annoyingly so.

452
00:24:22,838 --> 00:24:25,940
He isn't gonna put himself
back in jail over a dead kid.

453
00:24:26,007 --> 00:24:27,074
He's an addict,

454
00:24:27,142 --> 00:24:28,375
and he will
put himself back in jail

455
00:24:28,443 --> 00:24:30,978
over a puzzle.

456
00:24:31,046 --> 00:24:32,313
He'll back down.

457
00:24:37,853 --> 00:24:39,888
Halfway through
the perimetry exam,

458
00:24:39,956 --> 00:24:41,022
her tunnel vision
went away.

459
00:24:41,090 --> 00:24:43,258
- <i>She can see perfectly.</i>
- TIA.

460
00:24:43,325 --> 00:24:45,460
The word "transient"
is right there in the name.

461
00:24:48,764 --> 00:24:50,532
Ah, here we go.

462
00:24:54,837 --> 00:24:56,405
Chesa, after giving

463
00:24:56,473 --> 00:24:57,573
the pics an eye or two,

464
00:24:57,640 --> 00:24:59,441
I can confirm
that Lauren's surgeries

465
00:24:59,509 --> 00:25:01,376
cost her
some big bikkies.

466
00:25:01,444 --> 00:25:02,677
<i>Not only was there</i>
<i>a gut tuck,</i>

467
00:25:02,745 --> 00:25:05,146
<i>nose tuck,</i>
<i>and arse tuck,</i>

468
00:25:05,214 --> 00:25:06,481
but her new, fake norks
stick out

469
00:25:06,549 --> 00:25:07,749
like nuts on a mutt.

470
00:25:10,319 --> 00:25:11,519
The original script was--

471
00:25:11,587 --> 00:25:12,387
- Shh, shh, shh.
<i>Anyone notice...</i>

472
00:25:12,455 --> 00:25:14,657
He's enlightening us.

473
00:25:14,724 --> 00:25:16,025
<i>That's 'cause he's retooled</i>
<i>the ol' todger.</i>

474
00:25:16,093 --> 00:25:18,461
Let's just hope
no one cut the wrong wire, eh?

475
00:25:24,670 --> 00:25:26,838
So you just wanted
to look pretty on TV.

476
00:25:26,905 --> 00:25:28,206
Question is,
why did he want that?

477
00:25:28,274 --> 00:25:30,008
Clinic time.

478
00:25:30,075 --> 00:25:31,042
What do you
want us to do?

479
00:25:31,110 --> 00:25:35,346
MRA 4 TIA.
ROFL.

480
00:25:37,014 --> 00:25:38,281
Thought you only had clinic
on Tuesdays.

481
00:25:38,349 --> 00:25:40,817
Oh, you're right.

482
00:25:44,187 --> 00:25:46,122
Hi. I'm here
for the free flu shot.

483
00:25:46,190 --> 00:25:47,423
I got a call saying--

484
00:25:47,491 --> 00:25:48,824
I'm here to find out why
you didn't care about

485
00:25:48,892 --> 00:25:50,059
your first kid.

486
00:25:50,127 --> 00:25:53,930
Losing a child--
just breezed right through it.

487
00:25:53,998 --> 00:25:55,465
How do you know about
my first kid--

488
00:25:55,533 --> 00:25:57,468
Didn't even squeeze out
a single tear at the funeral.

489
00:25:57,535 --> 00:25:58,469
Where are you
getting this?

490
00:25:58,536 --> 00:25:59,403
You couldn't wait
to squeeze out

491
00:25:59,471 --> 00:26:01,539
a brand-new
replacement kid.

492
00:26:03,909 --> 00:26:06,044
Damn it.

493
00:26:06,112 --> 00:26:07,312
You had no right
to say that.

494
00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:08,680
I know.
I deserved the slap.

495
00:26:08,748 --> 00:26:11,516
But I was hoping that
you weren't capable of it.

496
00:26:11,584 --> 00:26:13,485
Apathetic hyperthyroidism.

497
00:26:13,553 --> 00:26:16,154
Could have kidney involvement.
Could be genetic.

498
00:26:16,222 --> 00:26:17,856
Definitely causes apathy.

499
00:26:17,924 --> 00:26:20,225
I was hoping that
your lack of emotion

500
00:26:20,293 --> 00:26:21,860
was a symptom of something
you could have passed on

501
00:26:21,928 --> 00:26:23,762
to your first son.

502
00:26:27,100 --> 00:26:28,366
You know Emory.

503
00:26:28,434 --> 00:26:30,702
We belong
to the same club.

504
00:26:30,770 --> 00:26:31,970
He wants to relive this.

505
00:26:32,038 --> 00:26:33,038
I don't.

506
00:26:33,105 --> 00:26:34,773
So I heard.

507
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:44,349
Emory was
a wonderful man.

508
00:26:44,417 --> 00:26:46,818
Never afraid to show
his emotions.

509
00:26:46,886 --> 00:26:48,453
Which is great,
most of the time.

510
00:26:48,521 --> 00:26:50,456
But when Drew died...

511
00:26:50,523 --> 00:26:53,926
it overwhelmed him.

512
00:26:53,994 --> 00:26:55,761
I vowed I wouldn't
let that happen to me.

513
00:26:55,829 --> 00:26:58,063
That's why you left him?

514
00:26:58,131 --> 00:26:59,498
<i>I left because</i>
<i>of his eyes.</i>

515
00:27:01,568 --> 00:27:04,403
He had Drew's eyes.

516
00:27:07,540 --> 00:27:09,075
Who used to babysit Drew?

517
00:27:09,142 --> 00:27:11,143
My father, but--

518
00:27:11,211 --> 00:27:12,111
His place or yours?

519
00:27:14,514 --> 00:27:17,116
There are two types
of people.

520
00:27:17,184 --> 00:27:18,618
<i>Those who can move on,</i>
<i>and those who can't.</i>

521
00:27:18,685 --> 00:27:20,653
<i>My father keeps up</i>
<i>a good front,</i>

522
00:27:20,721 --> 00:27:22,488
<i>but he's just like Emory.</i>

523
00:27:22,556 --> 00:27:24,424
<i>You need to</i>
<i>leave him alone.</i>

524
00:27:24,492 --> 00:27:27,093
So he has two types
of people inside of him.

525
00:27:38,039 --> 00:27:39,607
MRA was normal.

526
00:27:39,674 --> 00:27:40,875
Yeah, how did--

527
00:27:40,942 --> 00:27:42,209
I found out where
your boyfriend lives.

528
00:27:42,277 --> 00:27:45,113
When I paid him a visit,
he took off.

529
00:27:45,180 --> 00:27:47,015
Ran in front of a car.

530
00:27:47,082 --> 00:27:48,349
You're lying.

531
00:27:48,417 --> 00:27:50,184
He's down in the E.R.
right now.

532
00:27:50,252 --> 00:27:51,619
Shut up, you lying
sack of crap.

533
00:27:51,687 --> 00:27:53,354
Iris!

534
00:27:53,422 --> 00:27:55,456
How do you know
I'm lying?

535
00:27:55,524 --> 00:27:57,325
<i>How do you know</i>
<i>your boyfriend's okay?</i>

536
00:27:57,392 --> 00:27:59,527
'Cause I'm right here,
you dick.

537
00:28:06,422 --> 00:28:08,724
Iris has dissociative
identity disorder.

538
00:28:08,791 --> 00:28:10,959
Also known as multiple
personality disorder.

539
00:28:13,230 --> 00:28:14,664
Are you saying
I'm crazy?

540
00:28:14,731 --> 00:28:16,399
It's the mind's response
to a severe trauma.

541
00:28:16,467 --> 00:28:17,867
A person
experiences something

542
00:28:17,935 --> 00:28:19,569
<i>that's too difficult</i>
<i>to accept,</i>

543
00:28:19,637 --> 00:28:20,870
so they create
alternate personalities

544
00:28:20,938 --> 00:28:22,205
that don't
have to accept it.

545
00:28:22,272 --> 00:28:24,740
Some think it's quite
a natural reaction.

546
00:28:24,808 --> 00:28:26,842
Iris hasn't had
any severe traumas.

547
00:28:26,910 --> 00:28:27,976
The car accident?

548
00:28:28,044 --> 00:28:29,844
I was two.

549
00:28:29,912 --> 00:28:32,113
I don't remember anything.

550
00:28:32,181 --> 00:28:35,450
These personalities
that I'm supposed to have...

551
00:28:35,517 --> 00:28:36,851
Where are they?

552
00:28:36,919 --> 00:28:38,820
They only come out
when you're afraid or anxious.

553
00:28:38,887 --> 00:28:41,456
That's why House used
the hurt boyfriend story.

554
00:28:41,523 --> 00:28:42,590
<i>But if there's</i>
<i>no boyfriend,</i>

555
00:28:42,658 --> 00:28:43,859
<i>where did</i>
<i>the bruises come from?</i>

556
00:28:43,927 --> 00:28:45,027
The pregnancy?

557
00:28:46,629 --> 00:28:48,997
When you say
your boyfriend hit you,

558
00:28:49,065 --> 00:28:51,467
<i>it means you actually</i>
<i>hit yourself.</i>

559
00:28:51,534 --> 00:28:53,936
<i>And the pregnancy...</i>

560
00:28:54,004 --> 00:28:56,105
<i>doesn't take a boyfriend.</i>

561
00:28:56,173 --> 00:28:57,506
<i>Just a boy.</i>

562
00:28:59,809 --> 00:29:01,476
<i>You may not be aware</i>

563
00:29:01,544 --> 00:29:04,045
of half the things
you've done.

564
00:29:07,883 --> 00:29:10,184
How could this be happening

565
00:29:10,251 --> 00:29:12,052
<i>to my own daughter</i>
<i>without me knowing it?</i>

566
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:13,787
Diazepam was masking it.

567
00:29:13,854 --> 00:29:15,822
Taking her off
made it more apparent.

568
00:29:15,889 --> 00:29:17,557
But I--I wasn't on...

569
00:29:17,624 --> 00:29:18,958
"Diazepam"?

570
00:29:19,026 --> 00:29:20,593
What is that?

571
00:29:27,235 --> 00:29:30,437
That's what those
vitamin pills were.

572
00:29:31,807 --> 00:29:34,275
<i>Iris...I am so sorry.</i>

573
00:29:34,343 --> 00:29:36,378
<i>I just--I thought</i>
<i>you were moody.</i>

574
00:29:36,446 --> 00:29:40,616
<i>I didn't want you to think</i>
<i>you needed medication.</i>

575
00:29:43,587 --> 00:29:44,620
Oh, my God.

576
00:29:44,688 --> 00:29:46,622
I can't believe
how stupid I've been.

577
00:29:50,294 --> 00:29:51,929
We need you to help us
with something.

578
00:29:51,996 --> 00:29:55,099
Different alters can have
different apparent symptoms.

579
00:29:55,167 --> 00:29:57,635
<i>Allergies, paresthesia,</i>
<i>vision loss,</i>

580
00:29:57,703 --> 00:30:00,237
changes in blood pressure.
- Do you think I'm making this up?

581
00:30:00,305 --> 00:30:01,606
Your symptoms are real.

582
00:30:01,673 --> 00:30:03,007
But some are physiological,

583
00:30:03,074 --> 00:30:04,675
and others are psychological.

584
00:30:04,743 --> 00:30:06,410
So there's something
wrong with her...

585
00:30:06,478 --> 00:30:09,313
In addition
to the multiple personalities?

586
00:30:09,381 --> 00:30:11,015
Yes, but we
won't know what

587
00:30:11,083 --> 00:30:14,285
until we access her alters
and compare their symptoms.

588
00:30:14,352 --> 00:30:16,521
Well, how do you do that?

589
00:30:16,589 --> 00:30:18,222
Hypnosis.

590
00:30:20,559 --> 00:30:21,993
Foreman's
not gonna back down.

591
00:30:22,060 --> 00:30:24,328
He's not an idiot.

592
00:30:24,396 --> 00:30:25,429
Yes, he is.

593
00:30:25,497 --> 00:30:26,831
Just like you.

594
00:30:26,899 --> 00:30:27,999
If you keep being stubborn,

595
00:30:28,067 --> 00:30:29,534
he will keep
being stubborn.

596
00:30:29,602 --> 00:30:31,569
Eventually,
you will screw something up.

597
00:30:31,637 --> 00:30:33,505
Which will be bad news
for both of you.

598
00:30:33,572 --> 00:30:38,443
But...only one of you
will be in prison.

599
00:30:38,511 --> 00:30:42,013
It just isn't
worth it, House.

600
00:30:51,357 --> 00:30:52,624
Okay.

601
00:31:45,410 --> 00:31:46,977
Uh, y-yes, sir.

602
00:31:47,045 --> 00:31:48,946
I--yes,
I know I told you

603
00:31:49,014 --> 00:31:50,715
that I had a chiropractor's
appointment,

604
00:31:50,782 --> 00:31:53,985
but, uh, I got a flat.

605
00:31:54,053 --> 00:31:56,187
I know, right?

606
00:31:56,255 --> 00:31:57,722
So...

607
00:31:57,790 --> 00:31:59,724
You know,
don't send out the marines.

608
00:31:59,792 --> 00:32:02,960
I should be back on the road
in a few minutes.

609
00:32:03,028 --> 00:32:04,128
Okay, bye.

610
00:32:08,366 --> 00:32:11,569
Dr. James Wilson,
county coroner.

611
00:32:11,636 --> 00:32:12,936
I'd like to ask you
about your grandson,

612
00:32:13,004 --> 00:32:15,272
Drew Lemaine.

613
00:32:30,923 --> 00:32:33,158
What did he do
when he was here?

614
00:32:33,226 --> 00:32:34,193
Where did he play?
What did he eat?

615
00:32:34,260 --> 00:32:37,163
We watched a lot of TV.

616
00:32:37,230 --> 00:32:38,598
And ate biscuits.

617
00:32:40,768 --> 00:32:42,735
- Did you give him sidewalk chalk?
- <i>No.</i>

618
00:32:42,803 --> 00:32:45,037
- Finger paints?
- No!

619
00:32:45,105 --> 00:32:46,505
A sandbox?

620
00:32:46,573 --> 00:32:48,240
It's like I said.

621
00:32:48,308 --> 00:32:50,309
We watched a lotta TV.

622
00:32:56,049 --> 00:32:57,917
You expecting someone?

623
00:32:57,985 --> 00:32:59,052
What?

624
00:33:03,257 --> 00:33:05,459
Dr. Wilson my ass!

625
00:33:05,527 --> 00:33:07,394
I told you to leave him alone,
you son of a bitch!

626
00:33:07,462 --> 00:33:09,463
Temper trigger.

627
00:33:13,502 --> 00:33:16,337
<i>Who am I talking to now?</i>

628
00:33:16,405 --> 00:33:18,907
<i>Nobody.</i>

629
00:33:18,974 --> 00:33:21,509
<i>You must be somebody.</i>

630
00:33:21,577 --> 00:33:24,044
I'm too little.

631
00:33:24,112 --> 00:33:27,047
Nobody sees me.

632
00:33:27,115 --> 00:33:30,017
Nobody knows I'm here.

633
00:33:30,085 --> 00:33:33,921
<i>BP just went</i>
<i>to 140 over 90.</i>

634
00:33:33,989 --> 00:33:35,523
What is it?

635
00:33:35,590 --> 00:33:37,357
My arms.

636
00:33:37,425 --> 00:33:38,592
You can't
feel them?

637
00:33:40,962 --> 00:33:44,031
It's okay.
We can fix that.

638
00:33:44,098 --> 00:33:45,699
Do you hurt
anywhere else?

639
00:33:45,767 --> 00:33:48,535
Not right now.

640
00:33:48,603 --> 00:33:50,804
<i>But you</i>
<i>used to hurt?</i>

641
00:33:50,872 --> 00:33:55,909
When I ate strawberries.

642
00:33:55,977 --> 00:33:57,978
And when I remember...

643
00:34:00,015 --> 00:34:02,950
<i>Do you remember</i>
<i>being hurt?</i>

644
00:34:03,018 --> 00:34:05,620
I remember everything.

645
00:34:22,305 --> 00:34:24,439
<i>Baby...</i>

646
00:34:26,243 --> 00:34:28,076
It's going to be okay, baby.

647
00:34:52,602 --> 00:34:54,770
Iris?

648
00:34:54,838 --> 00:34:56,906
Why didn't you
ever tell me?

649
00:34:59,476 --> 00:35:01,544
It was my fault
daddy died.

650
00:35:01,612 --> 00:35:02,946
Oh, no. No.

651
00:35:03,014 --> 00:35:04,681
Yes, it was.

652
00:35:04,749 --> 00:35:06,717
I was crying,
and he couldn't drive.

653
00:35:06,785 --> 00:35:07,852
It was my fault
daddy's--

654
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:09,921
Oh, no.
No, no, honey.

655
00:35:09,989 --> 00:35:11,423
Yes.
You were just a baby.

656
00:35:11,491 --> 00:35:13,693
It wasn't your fault.
No, shh.

657
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:15,061
Oh, baby.

658
00:35:15,129 --> 00:35:16,629
It was my fault.

659
00:35:16,697 --> 00:35:18,564
I'm sorry, mommy.

660
00:35:18,632 --> 00:35:20,099
<i>Shh.</i>

661
00:35:20,167 --> 00:35:22,502
<i>I'm so sorry.</i>

662
00:35:34,382 --> 00:35:35,782
<i>It wasn't a miscarriage.</i>

663
00:35:35,850 --> 00:35:36,583
Test shows
she's still pregnant.

664
00:35:39,420 --> 00:35:40,686
<i>Okay, cross out everything</i>

665
00:35:40,754 --> 00:35:41,888
<i>that doesn't appear</i>
<i>in every alter.</i>

666
00:35:43,791 --> 00:35:45,292
When she opened
the Magic 8 Ball,

667
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:47,361
that triggered a switch
to a personality

668
00:35:47,428 --> 00:35:48,529
<i>with a strawberry allergy.</i>

669
00:35:48,596 --> 00:35:49,530
Pregnancy,
vaginal bleeding,

670
00:35:49,598 --> 00:35:50,698
and elevated B.P.

671
00:35:50,766 --> 00:35:51,866
Could be pre-eclampsia.

672
00:35:51,934 --> 00:35:53,701
Worst case, could be
an ectopic pregnancy.

673
00:35:53,769 --> 00:35:55,203
We need to ultrasound.

674
00:36:04,414 --> 00:36:06,749
Not seeing an embryo
in the fallopian tube.

675
00:36:06,817 --> 00:36:08,985
I'm not seeing
an embryo anywhere.

676
00:36:11,421 --> 00:36:13,522
Which idiot
did the pregnancy test?

677
00:36:13,590 --> 00:36:15,024
I did one of them.
Chase did another.

678
00:36:15,091 --> 00:36:17,827
Taub did a third.
Three tests, three positives.

679
00:36:17,895 --> 00:36:18,894
What happened to your eye?

680
00:36:18,962 --> 00:36:21,197
I grabbed Park's ass.

681
00:36:21,264 --> 00:36:24,000
Exoplanets.

682
00:36:24,068 --> 00:36:25,702
I think he said
exoplanets.

683
00:36:25,770 --> 00:36:27,070
Wait for it...

684
00:36:27,138 --> 00:36:29,439
We can't
actually see them...

685
00:36:29,506 --> 00:36:31,107
but we infer
their existence

686
00:36:31,174 --> 00:36:33,343
because of the effect they have
on the star they orbit.

687
00:36:33,410 --> 00:36:36,145
Pregnancy test only
infers an embryo's existence

688
00:36:36,213 --> 00:36:38,515
because of elevated
HCG levels.

689
00:36:38,582 --> 00:36:40,850
Which could also be caused
by choriocarcinoma,

690
00:36:40,918 --> 00:36:42,118
which affects
the placenta,

691
00:36:42,186 --> 00:36:43,486
<i>mimics pregnancy,</i>

692
00:36:43,554 --> 00:36:45,188
<i>and causes elevated BP</i>
<i>and vaginal bleeding.</i>

693
00:36:45,256 --> 00:36:46,656
Occult choriocarcinoma,

694
00:36:46,724 --> 00:36:49,459
which is why we didn't
see it on the ultrasound.

695
00:36:49,527 --> 00:36:50,560
Tell all the alters

696
00:36:50,628 --> 00:36:52,629
that they have cancer.

697
00:37:04,509 --> 00:37:06,210
<i>Mom or dad?</i>

698
00:37:06,277 --> 00:37:09,613
Mom, dad, and mom's dad.

699
00:37:09,681 --> 00:37:11,715
The good news is,

700
00:37:11,783 --> 00:37:14,652
made me realize
that you were right.

701
00:37:14,719 --> 00:37:15,720
I can't drop it.

702
00:37:18,624 --> 00:37:19,891
But now that I accept that,

703
00:37:19,959 --> 00:37:21,525
I feel much less conflicted.

704
00:37:21,593 --> 00:37:24,762
I've ruled out Wegener's,
Berger's, heavy metal poison--

705
00:37:24,830 --> 00:37:26,297
two trains
are about to collide,

706
00:37:26,365 --> 00:37:28,199
and I'm trying
to talk them out of it.

707
00:37:28,267 --> 00:37:29,334
Feels like
I'm missing something.

708
00:37:29,401 --> 00:37:30,368
<i>No, no.</i>

709
00:37:30,436 --> 00:37:31,569
You don't want
to listen to me,

710
00:37:31,637 --> 00:37:33,638
then I don't want
to listen to you.

711
00:37:33,706 --> 00:37:34,840
That is so fifth grade.
<i>I agree.</i>

712
00:37:34,907 --> 00:37:36,642
And you know why?

713
00:37:36,710 --> 00:37:38,110
Because I'm just as bad
as you.

714
00:37:38,178 --> 00:37:39,611
I knew this would fall
on deaf ears,

715
00:37:39,679 --> 00:37:42,714
but I just kept
talking and talking.

716
00:37:42,782 --> 00:37:45,016
You're right.

717
00:37:45,084 --> 00:37:48,753
You don't even know
what I just said.

718
00:37:48,821 --> 00:37:50,389
That is ridiculous.

719
00:37:50,456 --> 00:37:52,491
You said, "blah blah
blah blah blah, deaf ears,

720
00:37:52,559 --> 00:37:53,792
blah blah blah blah blah."

721
00:37:53,860 --> 00:37:56,028
Absolutely essential
information.

722
00:38:10,143 --> 00:38:12,377
Ray...

723
00:38:12,445 --> 00:38:14,046
Ray!

724
00:38:14,113 --> 00:38:15,514
Leave him alone.

725
00:38:15,581 --> 00:38:17,549
What are you doing to him?

726
00:38:17,617 --> 00:38:18,483
It's okay.

727
00:38:18,551 --> 00:38:20,185
<i>Mickey...</i>

728
00:38:20,253 --> 00:38:21,586
You? You brought him.

729
00:38:21,654 --> 00:38:22,721
I asked him
to meet me here

730
00:38:22,789 --> 00:38:24,189
for a family reunion.

731
00:38:24,257 --> 00:38:25,991
Ray!

732
00:38:26,059 --> 00:38:27,193
Let's just get
out of here, okay?

733
00:38:27,261 --> 00:38:28,494
I know
what killed your son.

734
00:38:28,561 --> 00:38:29,494
You don't get it,
do you?

735
00:38:29,562 --> 00:38:30,662
I don't care
what killed him!

736
00:38:30,730 --> 00:38:31,930
It's called
Alport syndrome.

737
00:38:31,998 --> 00:38:33,265
It's a genetic condition

738
00:38:33,333 --> 00:38:35,234
characterized
by kidney failure,

739
00:38:35,302 --> 00:38:36,569
bronchial myomas,
Mees' lines,

740
00:38:36,636 --> 00:38:38,171
and deafness.

741
00:38:38,238 --> 00:38:39,906
Idiot. Drew wasn't deaf!

742
00:38:39,973 --> 00:38:41,274
House...
<i>Son of a bitch!</i>

743
00:38:41,341 --> 00:38:42,308
Get away from them!

744
00:38:42,376 --> 00:38:43,743
House, House!

745
00:38:43,811 --> 00:38:45,244
It's a genetic
condition!

746
00:38:45,312 --> 00:38:46,779
- Shut up!
- Genetic!

747
00:38:50,784 --> 00:38:52,551
Your father has the gene.

748
00:38:52,619 --> 00:38:53,786
So do you.

749
00:38:53,854 --> 00:38:56,923
It's grandpa's
slight deafness

750
00:38:56,990 --> 00:38:58,124
that gave the game away.

751
00:38:58,191 --> 00:38:59,959
You're apparently
asymptomatic.

752
00:39:00,027 --> 00:39:03,429
You could still pass
the gene onto your children.

753
00:39:03,497 --> 00:39:04,764
Plural.

754
00:39:09,770 --> 00:39:10,970
You're lying.

755
00:39:16,410 --> 00:39:18,511
He has high-frequency
hearing impairment.

756
00:39:18,579 --> 00:39:20,346
And so did Drew.

757
00:39:20,414 --> 00:39:22,582
That's why Drew
made up his own words.

758
00:39:22,649 --> 00:39:23,783
'Cause he couldn't
hear properly.

759
00:39:29,022 --> 00:39:30,956
It's okay.
Now that we know what it is,

760
00:39:31,024 --> 00:39:33,326
he'll need treatment,
but he'll live.

761
00:39:39,499 --> 00:39:41,333
You know, there are platitudes
that can help you with that.

762
00:40:11,798 --> 00:40:14,166
I miss him too.

763
00:40:51,370 --> 00:40:52,938
She's responding well.

764
00:41:10,388 --> 00:41:12,289
Cuddy threatened him
with clinic duty.

765
00:41:12,356 --> 00:41:13,823
I thought
threatening him with jail

766
00:41:13,891 --> 00:41:14,991
would be different.

767
00:41:15,059 --> 00:41:18,827
Not an irrational thought.

768
00:41:18,895 --> 00:41:22,164
I'm still
sending him back.

769
00:41:22,232 --> 00:41:23,799
He saved two lives.

770
00:41:23,867 --> 00:41:25,768
Which means it's too late
for me to back down.

771
00:41:25,836 --> 00:41:27,537
<i>It's no longer</i>
<i>my choice.</i>

772
00:41:27,604 --> 00:41:30,039
It's just me telling him
he can get away with anything.

773
00:41:31,976 --> 00:41:34,912
I have to send him
to prison.

774
00:41:42,254 --> 00:41:46,390
Your job is to keep
this machine running.

775
00:41:46,458 --> 00:41:49,293
It's your choice
to make House a useful tool

776
00:41:49,361 --> 00:41:50,927
or a monkey wrench.

777
00:41:50,995 --> 00:41:53,697
Cuddy's way didn't fail

778
00:41:53,764 --> 00:41:55,799
because she didn't
try to control House.

779
00:41:55,866 --> 00:41:57,600
She managed him.

780
00:42:01,104 --> 00:42:03,640
She knew better than anybody
what a tool he could be.

781
00:42:35,776 --> 00:42:38,044
What would Cuddy
have done?

782
00:42:41,816 --> 00:42:43,984
Ten clinic hours.

783
00:42:48,256 --> 00:42:50,191
Cuddy's not here
anymore.

784
00:42:50,259 --> 00:42:52,326
You got 30.

785
