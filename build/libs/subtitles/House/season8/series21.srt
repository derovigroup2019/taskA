1
00:00:34,219 --> 00:00:36,637
Come on in.

2
00:00:36,705 --> 00:00:39,740
I'm not doing
any more chemo.

3
00:00:46,682 --> 00:00:47,765
Good plan.

4
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:50,051
You'll be dead
in five months.

5
00:00:53,055 --> 00:00:55,940
We went for a cure.
It didn't work.

6
00:00:56,024 --> 00:00:58,776
I've thought about this
a lot.

7
00:00:58,861 --> 00:01:01,245
Five more months
on this earth is reasonable.

8
00:01:01,330 --> 00:01:06,033
A year in the hospital
in excruciating pain is...

9
00:01:08,237 --> 00:01:09,454
not.

10
00:01:09,538 --> 00:01:11,956
With two weeks on,
two weeks off of chemo,

11
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:13,925
you'll have
way more than a year,

12
00:01:14,009 --> 00:01:16,511
maybe two or three.

13
00:01:16,578 --> 00:01:19,430
House...

14
00:01:19,515 --> 00:01:21,449
I'm sorry.

15
00:01:27,606 --> 00:01:30,608
I'm not gonna
let you just die.

[Massive Attack's <i>Teardrop]</i>

18
00:01:48,562 --> 00:02:10,497
?

19
00:02:20,442 --> 00:02:23,077
Hey. You know,
management research

20
00:02:23,144 --> 00:02:27,314
shows that the best ideas
come from casual contact.

21
00:02:27,366 --> 00:02:28,583
<i>So...</i>

22
00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:30,117
one set of season tickets.

23
00:02:30,168 --> 00:02:31,986
Got the seat next to you.

24
00:02:34,256 --> 00:02:35,489
First game
is October 8th.

25
00:02:35,541 --> 00:02:36,958
<i>That's about one month</i>

26
00:02:37,009 --> 00:02:38,843
after Wilson's
expiration date.

27
00:02:38,927 --> 00:02:41,846
This isn't an unstructured
collaboration.

28
00:02:41,930 --> 00:02:43,330
You're trying to be
the new Wilson.

29
00:02:43,382 --> 00:02:44,665
I'm trying to show you

30
00:02:44,716 --> 00:02:46,133
there are other people
who care about you.

31
00:02:46,201 --> 00:02:48,185
Relax.

32
00:02:48,270 --> 00:02:50,388
I'm probably
not gonna fall apart.

33
00:02:55,510 --> 00:02:56,944
Five, six, seven, eight.

34
00:02:57,012 --> 00:02:58,696
One, two, three, four,

35
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:00,214
five, six, seven, eight.

36
00:03:00,282 --> 00:03:01,866
<i>One, two, three, four,</i>

37
00:03:01,950 --> 00:03:03,651
<i>five, six, seven, eight.</i>

38
00:03:03,702 --> 00:03:05,736
<i>Here we go.</i>

39
00:03:05,821 --> 00:03:08,522
<i>Cradle! One, two, three, four--</i>
Put down the pom-poms.

40
00:03:08,574 --> 00:03:10,024
Aah!
<i>Step away from the computer.</i>

41
00:03:10,075 --> 00:03:13,861
46-year-old oncologist
refuses treatment.

42
00:03:13,912 --> 00:03:16,380
<i>Foreman already gave us a case.</i>

43
00:03:16,465 --> 00:03:18,866
Wants us to keep things
as normal as possible

44
00:03:18,917 --> 00:03:21,035
for as long as possible.

45
00:03:21,086 --> 00:03:22,870
Wilson is dying.
Chase is gone.

46
00:03:22,921 --> 00:03:25,506
How close to normal
do you think we can come?

47
00:03:25,557 --> 00:03:28,009
19-year-old cheerleader
admitted with massive nosebleed

48
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:29,644
and dizziness.

49
00:03:29,711 --> 00:03:31,812
Wow. Cool.

50
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:34,815
I just completely forgot
that my best friend is dying.

51
00:03:34,883 --> 00:03:36,851
Wait. That just reminded me.

52
00:03:36,902 --> 00:03:38,569
Head CT is clean.

53
00:03:38,654 --> 00:03:41,555
How can we turn Wilson
from a terminal idiot

54
00:03:41,607 --> 00:03:44,241
into an interminable
pain in the ass?

55
00:03:44,326 --> 00:03:45,993
<i>Mini stroke could explain</i>

56
00:03:46,061 --> 00:03:47,828
our patient's neurosymptoms
and his butterfingers.

57
00:03:47,896 --> 00:03:49,246
But not his bloody nose.

58
00:03:49,331 --> 00:03:52,450
My best friend
is trying to kill himself.

59
00:03:52,534 --> 00:03:54,669
He just wants to die
with a little dignity.

60
00:03:54,736 --> 00:03:57,905
There's no such thing.

61
00:03:57,956 --> 00:03:59,707
<i>It's not your choice,</i>
<i>House.</i>

62
00:03:59,758 --> 00:04:01,792
Your only choice here

63
00:04:01,877 --> 00:04:04,261
is between acceptance
and misery.

64
00:04:07,215 --> 00:04:11,302
It's a midline granuloma.
Get your patient a pet scan.

65
00:04:19,528 --> 00:04:22,146
No lesions
along the optic track?

66
00:04:22,230 --> 00:04:23,564
You already covered that.

67
00:04:23,615 --> 00:04:26,617
Maybe we should get
someone else to take this case.

68
00:04:26,702 --> 00:04:28,703
Why? Because someone
somewhere is dying?

69
00:04:31,490 --> 00:04:33,541
Oh, crap,
turn off the mike!

70
00:04:33,608 --> 00:04:35,876
It is off.

71
00:04:35,944 --> 00:04:38,079
Not according to his brain.

72
00:04:38,130 --> 00:04:40,614
His temporal lobe
is completely lit up.

73
00:04:40,666 --> 00:04:42,783
Auditory portion.

74
00:04:42,834 --> 00:04:45,285
He's hearing something.

75
00:04:59,901 --> 00:05:01,468
Foreman's trying to date me.

76
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:04,238
<i>I assume that's because</i>
<i>you called him.</i>

77
00:05:04,305 --> 00:05:05,823
No, I--

78
00:05:05,907 --> 00:05:06,941
did you...

79
00:05:06,992 --> 00:05:09,527
put something
in my coffee?

80
00:05:09,611 --> 00:05:11,478
You know how you can
be there for me

81
00:05:11,530 --> 00:05:13,581
five months from now?

82
00:05:13,648 --> 00:05:17,168
Don't be dead
five months from now.

83
00:05:30,632 --> 00:05:31,599
Hey, Wils--

84
00:05:34,403 --> 00:05:35,770
<i>seriously?</i>

85
00:05:35,837 --> 00:05:37,271
Just a little
picker-downer.

86
00:05:37,338 --> 00:05:39,557
<i>I assume</i>
<i>this unwanted interruption</i>

87
00:05:39,641 --> 00:05:42,059
means you're looking for me to
discuss the latest development

88
00:05:42,144 --> 00:05:44,445
in the case
I don't want to discuss.

89
00:05:44,512 --> 00:05:46,113
<i>Our patient</i>
<i>is hearing voices.</i>

90
00:05:46,181 --> 00:05:48,365
He denies it,
but the PET scan says otherwise.

91
00:05:48,450 --> 00:05:49,700
He's at the right age

92
00:05:49,785 --> 00:05:51,118
for the onset
of schizophrenia.

93
00:05:51,186 --> 00:05:53,287
Yeah.
You really need me.

94
00:05:53,354 --> 00:05:56,323
Ultrasound his abdomen
to check for schizophrenia.

95
00:05:56,374 --> 00:05:58,125
We already ordered
a psych evaluation,

96
00:05:58,193 --> 00:05:59,693
but drugs could also cause--

97
00:05:59,745 --> 00:06:01,028
Tox screen was clean.

98
00:06:01,079 --> 00:06:02,963
Ultrasound his dorm.

99
00:06:05,133 --> 00:06:07,201
Whoa, just...

100
00:06:07,252 --> 00:06:09,086
You guys can't just
come busting in here

101
00:06:09,171 --> 00:06:11,038
without a warrant.

102
00:06:11,089 --> 00:06:15,309
We're not cops.
We're your roommate's doctors.

103
00:06:17,179 --> 00:06:20,097
Any idea
what flavor of drugs

104
00:06:20,182 --> 00:06:21,982
would be making
your roommate sick?

105
00:06:22,050 --> 00:06:22,933
<i>Objection.</i>

106
00:06:23,018 --> 00:06:25,820
Entrapment.

107
00:06:25,887 --> 00:06:27,071
I'm pre-law.

108
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:30,775
<i>Derrick doesn't party.</i>

109
00:06:33,078 --> 00:06:34,578
Look at this.

110
00:06:34,663 --> 00:06:37,081
Why would he have
a picture of a little boy?

111
00:06:37,165 --> 00:06:38,899
Maybe it's his nephew
or something?

112
00:06:38,950 --> 00:06:41,452
Hidden in his sock drawer?

113
00:06:41,536 --> 00:06:43,403
Whoa! Creepy.

114
00:06:51,963 --> 00:06:54,048
<i>We need to talk to Derrick</i>
<i>about some medical matters.</i>

115
00:06:54,099 --> 00:06:56,083
Well, she's my girlfriend.
She can be here for that.

116
00:07:00,188 --> 00:07:02,556
We found this...

117
00:07:02,607 --> 00:07:04,108
in your dorm room.

118
00:07:04,192 --> 00:07:07,194
Who is that?

119
00:07:07,262 --> 00:07:09,363
Nobody.

120
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:11,899
Then why was it
hidden in a drawer?

121
00:07:14,302 --> 00:07:16,270
Derrick, what's she
talking about?

122
00:07:19,241 --> 00:07:21,125
It's my brother
Christopher.

123
00:07:23,078 --> 00:07:24,879
You never told me
you had a brother.

124
00:07:24,946 --> 00:07:28,332
Well, he's been dead
almost ten years, so...

125
00:07:30,385 --> 00:07:33,387
Is that the voice
you hear in your head?

126
00:07:39,177 --> 00:07:41,979
Mm...

127
00:07:44,232 --> 00:07:46,016
Uhh!

128
00:07:48,353 --> 00:07:50,988
And lo, he is risen.

129
00:07:51,072 --> 00:07:53,974
So now my hair's
gonna fall out next week?

130
00:07:54,025 --> 00:07:56,310
No. All I did was
temporarily kill you.

131
00:07:56,361 --> 00:07:58,245
How was it?

132
00:07:58,313 --> 00:08:00,447
What--I don't--
I wasn't dead.

133
00:08:00,498 --> 00:08:01,782
I was unconscious.

134
00:08:01,833 --> 00:08:03,483
No dreams, no thoughts.

135
00:08:03,535 --> 00:08:05,703
You experienced nothing.

136
00:08:05,787 --> 00:08:09,757
Now, imagine that without
the waking up on the couch part.

137
00:08:09,824 --> 00:08:12,593
Just nothing times infinity.

138
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:15,713
You didn't just prove
death is nothing.

139
00:08:15,797 --> 00:08:17,715
You proved propofol is.

140
00:08:20,068 --> 00:08:22,553
You're saying the end
is not the end?

141
00:08:25,941 --> 00:08:28,309
I was expecting "nothing
is better than something lousy,"

142
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:31,445
but not "the angels
are waiting for me."

143
00:08:31,512 --> 00:08:33,063
I'm not having
this conversation.

144
00:08:33,148 --> 00:08:35,616
Why? 'Cause it doesn't
make sense?

145
00:08:35,683 --> 00:08:37,034
Because I'm not gonna
change your mind,

146
00:08:37,118 --> 00:08:38,652
and I don't care.

147
00:08:38,703 --> 00:08:40,371
More importantly,
you're not gonna change mine.

148
00:08:40,455 --> 00:08:42,539
There is no heaven.
There is no hell.

149
00:08:42,624 --> 00:08:45,025
Your soul is not gonna
float out of your body

150
00:08:45,076 --> 00:08:48,078
and join some great
unifying energy force.

151
00:08:48,163 --> 00:08:50,247
The fact that you're dying
is not gonna change that.

152
00:08:50,332 --> 00:08:53,050
Please...just go.

153
00:08:58,840 --> 00:08:59,706
House.

154
00:09:01,393 --> 00:09:03,811
I have spent
the last 20 years

155
00:09:03,878 --> 00:09:07,431
holding the hands
of people as they die.

156
00:09:07,515 --> 00:09:10,351
When I watch
that transformation...

157
00:09:12,354 --> 00:09:14,989
I'm sorry, I...

158
00:09:15,056 --> 00:09:18,075
Don't believe that we're
just a bag of chemicals.

159
00:09:29,465 --> 00:09:31,516
So are we gonna
talk about the patient

160
00:09:31,601 --> 00:09:33,668
or wait for House?

161
00:09:33,719 --> 00:09:35,053
Viral encephalitis.

162
00:09:35,138 --> 00:09:38,106
It's been going on
for ten years.

163
00:09:38,174 --> 00:09:41,359
I'm gonna go in there
and invite him to participate.

164
00:09:41,361 --> 00:09:43,895
I think he'd welcome
the distraction.

165
00:09:45,982 --> 00:09:48,366
Come with me?

166
00:09:51,353 --> 00:09:53,288
Why?

167
00:09:53,355 --> 00:09:54,856
<i>When was the last time</i>

168
00:09:54,907 --> 00:09:57,993
House listened to anything
we said about anything personal?

169
00:09:58,044 --> 00:09:59,628
<i>Maybe you'll feel better,</i>

170
00:09:59,695 --> 00:10:02,080
but sometimes the truth is

171
00:10:02,165 --> 00:10:05,534
there's nothing
anyone can do.

172
00:10:10,673 --> 00:10:12,373
Temporal lobe epilepsy.

173
00:10:12,425 --> 00:10:14,643
<i>Causes voices, dizziness.</i>
<i>Trauma from seizure</i>

174
00:10:14,710 --> 00:10:16,061
would explain the nose bleed.

175
00:10:17,713 --> 00:10:19,547
You know about
all of my siblings

176
00:10:19,599 --> 00:10:21,316
and cousins
and aunts and uncles and--

177
00:10:21,383 --> 00:10:23,051
You're overreacting.

178
00:10:23,102 --> 00:10:24,831
<i>Because you don't trust me</i>
<i>enough to tell me--</i>

179
00:10:24,856 --> 00:10:25,520
Sorry.

180
00:10:25,521 --> 00:10:28,990
It's time to go down
for your test.

181
00:10:29,058 --> 00:10:30,358
If you wanna wait here,

182
00:10:30,409 --> 00:10:32,577
it'll only take
about an hour.

183
00:10:32,662 --> 00:10:34,729
No. She's leaving.

184
00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:37,415
Derrick, come on.

185
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:38,783
I mean,
we should at least talk.

186
00:10:38,868 --> 00:10:42,287
I'd rather
you just leave.

187
00:10:42,371 --> 00:10:44,923
And you don't need
to come back.

188
00:10:55,601 --> 00:10:57,052
Time.

189
00:10:57,119 --> 00:10:58,987
<i>Any odd tastes or smells?</i>

190
00:10:59,055 --> 00:11:01,256
Nope. Feel fine.

191
00:11:01,307 --> 00:11:03,258
Things look fine
on my end too.

192
00:11:07,563 --> 00:11:08,763
So...

193
00:11:08,814 --> 00:11:11,399
you won't admit
to your doctors

194
00:11:11,450 --> 00:11:13,034
that you're hearing
your brother's voice,

195
00:11:13,102 --> 00:11:15,370
which is dangerous.

196
00:11:15,437 --> 00:11:17,656
And now you lost
your girlfriend over it,

197
00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:19,291
which is stupid.

198
00:11:19,375 --> 00:11:21,409
I assume
there's more to the story?

199
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:23,278
That's how I was raised.

200
00:11:24,947 --> 00:11:26,047
Short story.

201
00:11:26,115 --> 00:11:27,299
Yeah.

202
00:11:27,383 --> 00:11:29,634
My boss is losing
his best friend to cancer.

203
00:11:29,719 --> 00:11:33,054
And instead of talking
about the pain,

204
00:11:33,122 --> 00:11:35,056
he's pretending
there is no pain

205
00:11:35,124 --> 00:11:37,559
because everything
can be fixed.

206
00:11:43,349 --> 00:11:45,684
My father
tried to deal with it.

207
00:11:45,768 --> 00:11:47,902
Ironic that he'd drink
himself into oblivion

208
00:11:47,970 --> 00:11:51,106
after my brother was killed
by a drunk driver.

209
00:11:55,361 --> 00:11:57,746
Do you need a tissue?

210
00:12:00,333 --> 00:12:02,550
After dad left,

211
00:12:02,618 --> 00:12:05,203
my mom moved us away.

212
00:12:05,288 --> 00:12:07,822
She got rid of all the pictures
of Christopher

213
00:12:07,873 --> 00:12:09,524
and never mentioned him
again.

214
00:12:09,592 --> 00:12:11,693
It was like
he never existed.

215
00:12:11,761 --> 00:12:14,045
And that worked for us.

216
00:12:14,130 --> 00:12:17,098
And yet, you kept one.

217
00:12:17,166 --> 00:12:19,167
Uh, my right eye...

218
00:12:19,218 --> 00:12:21,803
I was seeing spots,
but now I can't see at all.

219
00:12:21,854 --> 00:12:23,855
Is that from the test?

220
00:12:23,939 --> 00:12:25,807
No.
This is something else.

221
00:12:25,858 --> 00:12:27,642
Aah! That hurts.

222
00:12:27,693 --> 00:12:28,560
Sorry.

223
00:12:30,563 --> 00:12:31,780
How many fingers?

224
00:12:31,847 --> 00:12:33,565
Two. Fuzzy ones,
but two.

225
00:12:33,649 --> 00:12:35,567
There's a clot in the artery
behind your eye.

226
00:12:35,651 --> 00:12:37,185
I just broke it up.

227
00:12:37,236 --> 00:12:38,870
Is that bad?

228
00:12:38,954 --> 00:12:42,123
Don't know, because I don't
know why it happened.

229
00:12:48,831 --> 00:12:51,299
Hey.
Saved us a table.

230
00:12:51,367 --> 00:12:53,084
There are no tables.

231
00:12:53,169 --> 00:12:56,338
I recently hacked into
your old files.

232
00:12:56,389 --> 00:12:59,391
Found a six-year-old boy
with bilateral retinoblastoma.

233
00:12:59,475 --> 00:13:00,975
Doctors wanted
to take his eyes out

234
00:13:01,043 --> 00:13:02,877
before the cancer
spread to his brain,

235
00:13:02,928 --> 00:13:04,545
and you fought them.

236
00:13:04,597 --> 00:13:07,315
Advocated for a new photon
beam radiation.

237
00:13:07,383 --> 00:13:10,985
Saved the kid's vision.
Probably saved his life.

238
00:13:11,053 --> 00:13:13,221
That was my first case
at PPTH.

239
00:13:13,272 --> 00:13:14,522
Mikey Kimble.

240
00:13:14,573 --> 00:13:16,107
<i>It's Michael now.</i>

241
00:13:19,362 --> 00:13:21,329
Oh, yeah.
This is our table.

242
00:13:21,397 --> 00:13:23,248
Wow.

243
00:13:23,332 --> 00:13:25,083
I...

244
00:13:28,087 --> 00:13:29,170
How are you?

245
00:13:29,238 --> 00:13:30,839
I'm doing great.

246
00:13:30,906 --> 00:13:32,707
I'm graduating next month.

247
00:13:32,758 --> 00:13:34,592
Already?

248
00:13:34,677 --> 00:13:36,177
Little Mikey?

249
00:13:36,245 --> 00:13:39,080
And I got accepted
to Princeton.

250
00:13:39,148 --> 00:13:41,633
And I'm planning
on going to med school.

251
00:13:41,717 --> 00:13:43,218
Oh...

252
00:13:43,269 --> 00:13:44,752
<i>He's going to be a doctor</i>

253
00:13:44,804 --> 00:13:46,137
instead of being dead.

254
00:13:48,691 --> 00:13:49,941
<i>Dr. House</i>

255
00:13:50,025 --> 00:13:53,311
told me all about
your situation.

256
00:13:53,396 --> 00:13:55,430
<i>That's why I came.</i>

257
00:13:55,481 --> 00:13:57,932
<i>There's just so much good</i>
<i>that you can do,</i>

258
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,634
even in a small
amount of time.

259
00:14:03,656 --> 00:14:04,706
I wonder...

260
00:14:06,492 --> 00:14:08,042
Hey!

261
00:14:08,110 --> 00:14:09,494
Is there anybody else here

262
00:14:09,578 --> 00:14:12,613
who's alive today
because of Dr. James Wilson?

263
00:14:32,518 --> 00:14:35,437
Gastric adenocarcinoma.

264
00:14:35,488 --> 00:14:37,739
15 years in remission.

265
00:14:37,806 --> 00:14:41,359
<i>Six grandchildren</i>
<i>that I never would have met.</i>

266
00:14:41,444 --> 00:14:42,861
Thank you, Dr. Wilson.

267
00:14:45,114 --> 00:14:46,147
<i>Squamous cell lung cancer.</i>

268
00:14:46,198 --> 00:14:48,483
12 years in remission.

269
00:14:48,534 --> 00:14:52,036
I was able to walk my daughter
down the aisle last May.

270
00:14:52,121 --> 00:14:54,205
Thank you, Dr. Wilson.

271
00:15:04,166 --> 00:15:05,884
<i>I did the math.</i>

272
00:15:05,968 --> 00:15:08,019
74 children are alive today

273
00:15:08,103 --> 00:15:10,505
because of you.

274
00:15:10,556 --> 00:15:12,774
14 grandchildren.

275
00:15:16,228 --> 00:15:18,313
Mikey Kimble
started kindergarten

276
00:15:18,364 --> 00:15:21,182
before the age cutoff.

277
00:15:23,152 --> 00:15:25,854
He would have graduated
high school last year.

278
00:15:27,706 --> 00:15:30,041
I flunked a year.

279
00:15:30,125 --> 00:15:32,377
Was anybody in this room

280
00:15:32,461 --> 00:15:34,546
really a patient of mine?

281
00:15:40,503 --> 00:15:41,869
They're somewhere.

282
00:15:41,921 --> 00:15:46,040
They're giving you
a standing "O" somewhere.

283
00:15:46,091 --> 00:15:48,426
They exist.
You saved their lives.

284
00:15:48,511 --> 00:15:52,213
Actually, more impressive--
they're too busy to be here.

285
00:15:57,686 --> 00:15:59,354
What's this?

286
00:15:59,405 --> 00:16:00,939
A glowing letter
of recommendation

287
00:16:01,023 --> 00:16:03,241
you just wrote for me
on my laptop.

288
00:16:03,325 --> 00:16:05,527
I notice it's lacking
your signature at the bottom.

289
00:16:05,578 --> 00:16:07,028
Don't you think you're being
a bit premature

290
00:16:07,096 --> 00:16:08,279
predicting House's demise?

291
00:16:08,364 --> 00:16:10,331
Not demise.
Just implosion.

292
00:16:11,834 --> 00:16:13,568
He's going through
a rough time,

293
00:16:13,619 --> 00:16:15,870
but so far,
he's been handling it--

294
00:16:26,849 --> 00:16:27,782
House.

295
00:16:30,469 --> 00:16:32,253
Your shoes are wet!

296
00:16:32,304 --> 00:16:33,805
Glad to see
your emotional turmoil

297
00:16:33,889 --> 00:16:36,057
hasn't dulled your powers
of observation.

298
00:16:36,108 --> 00:16:38,476
I know you're responsible.

299
00:16:38,561 --> 00:16:41,646
No, you don't.
'Cause I didn't do it.

300
00:16:41,730 --> 00:16:43,765
Whatever <i>it</i> is.

301
00:16:43,832 --> 00:16:45,766
But if I had shoved
those season tickets

302
00:16:45,818 --> 00:16:47,435
down some toilets,

303
00:16:47,486 --> 00:16:50,121
I would have done it
because you asked me to.

304
00:16:50,205 --> 00:16:51,656
You wanted to replace Wilson.

305
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:53,458
I prank Wilson all the time.

306
00:16:53,542 --> 00:16:54,792
Enjoy.

307
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:20,946
I got you three,
but I drank them.

308
00:17:23,021 --> 00:17:24,521
You didn't have to
call me,

309
00:17:24,606 --> 00:17:26,607
but I appreciate
I made the list.

310
00:17:26,674 --> 00:17:28,725
It wasn't entirely
unselfish.

311
00:17:35,784 --> 00:17:37,618
I didn't feel right

312
00:17:37,685 --> 00:17:39,903
approaching any
of my terminal patients,

313
00:17:39,988 --> 00:17:43,157
<i>but...</i>

314
00:17:46,527 --> 00:17:48,412
What is it like?

315
00:17:48,496 --> 00:17:50,297
Hmm...

316
00:17:50,364 --> 00:17:53,533
Does it ever stop
being surreal?

317
00:17:56,370 --> 00:17:58,889
It'll stop in about...

318
00:17:58,973 --> 00:18:01,875
five or six months,
give or take, in your case.

319
00:18:05,213 --> 00:18:07,397
You know what happened
to me today?

320
00:18:07,482 --> 00:18:11,018
One of my patients
suddenly started crying.

321
00:18:11,069 --> 00:18:13,153
It can't be your first.

322
00:18:13,221 --> 00:18:16,990
The first one...
who was crying for me.

323
00:18:19,227 --> 00:18:21,495
It's the human response.

324
00:18:21,562 --> 00:18:23,247
It's either
overly saccharine,

325
00:18:23,331 --> 00:18:25,499
because giving sympathy
makes them feel better,

326
00:18:25,566 --> 00:18:27,117
<i>or they ignore you,</i>

327
00:18:27,202 --> 00:18:30,170
because hiding from mortality
makes them feel better.

328
00:18:30,238 --> 00:18:31,872
Why can't they just
say something

329
00:18:31,923 --> 00:18:33,440
that makes <i>me</i>
feel better?

330
00:18:33,508 --> 00:18:35,843
Like what, exactly?

331
00:18:40,915 --> 00:18:41,932
I don't know.

332
00:18:42,016 --> 00:18:43,433
<i>No.</i>

333
00:18:47,138 --> 00:18:51,475
You'd be doing what,
two weeks on, two weeks off?

334
00:18:51,559 --> 00:18:53,110
So maybe do your first round,
see how it goes.

335
00:18:53,194 --> 00:18:56,113
<i>Maybe not as horrible</i>
<i>as you fear.</i>

336
00:18:56,197 --> 00:18:58,949
Then do the second round,
enjoy your two weeks off,

337
00:18:59,033 --> 00:19:00,951
and revisit the decision.

338
00:19:01,035 --> 00:19:02,269
Rinse, repeat.

339
00:19:06,875 --> 00:19:10,327
I just can't envision
spending my remaining time

340
00:19:10,411 --> 00:19:12,546
in a chemo suite
in Princeton.

341
00:19:16,417 --> 00:19:18,785
I want to...

342
00:19:18,836 --> 00:19:21,171
enjoy myself
with family and friends.

343
00:19:23,508 --> 00:19:25,959
Friends or friend?

344
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:30,430
Hi, this is Greg House.
Again.

345
00:19:30,481 --> 00:19:32,482
Third message,
hopefully indicating

346
00:19:32,567 --> 00:19:34,801
how much I want you
to call me back.

347
00:19:34,852 --> 00:19:37,470
I'd say that your son is dying
to increase the urgency,

348
00:19:37,522 --> 00:19:40,991
but you probably
already know that.

349
00:19:41,075 --> 00:19:42,409
The fake people who care

350
00:19:42,476 --> 00:19:44,111
that Wilson stays alive
didn't work,

351
00:19:44,162 --> 00:19:46,280
so I need the real people
who care about him

352
00:19:46,331 --> 00:19:48,081
to tell him what an idiot
he's being.

353
00:19:48,149 --> 00:19:49,283
Where are we going?

354
00:19:49,334 --> 00:19:51,368
I just got paged
to go to the bathroom.

355
00:19:51,452 --> 00:19:53,620
I don't know where
the rest of you are going.

356
00:19:53,671 --> 00:19:56,323
Some of our patient's symptoms
might be physiological,

357
00:19:56,374 --> 00:19:57,874
and some might be
psychological.

358
00:19:57,959 --> 00:19:59,659
You think being forced
to bury painful memories

359
00:19:59,711 --> 00:20:01,178
is making symptoms worse?

360
00:20:01,262 --> 00:20:03,847
Grief avoidance can lead to
all sorts of anxiety disorders,

361
00:20:03,932 --> 00:20:08,468
which can manifest
into physical illness.

362
00:20:08,519 --> 00:20:13,340
Let's assume...that all his
symptoms are real symptoms.

363
00:20:13,391 --> 00:20:16,226
So we're going to avoid
grief avoidance?

364
00:20:16,311 --> 00:20:17,694
Studies after
September 11th showed

365
00:20:17,779 --> 00:20:19,512
that repression was actually
better for coping

366
00:20:19,564 --> 00:20:21,148
than dwelling in misery.

367
00:20:21,199 --> 00:20:22,983
<i>What about</i>
<i>polycythemia vera?</i>

368
00:20:23,034 --> 00:20:25,185
RBCs are slightly
elevated, but not that much.

369
00:20:25,236 --> 00:20:26,703
Hodgkin's lymphoma?

370
00:20:26,788 --> 00:20:28,739
Would have showed up
in the PET scan.

371
00:20:28,823 --> 00:20:30,540
What if your guy
got hurt at practice?

372
00:20:30,625 --> 00:20:33,543
And, like everything else,
just didn't tell anyone.

373
00:20:33,628 --> 00:20:36,863
Could have set off DIC,
would explain everything.

374
00:20:36,914 --> 00:20:38,548
I thought you had
to go to the bathroom.

375
00:20:38,633 --> 00:20:40,300
I didn't say
I had to go in.

376
00:20:40,368 --> 00:20:43,136
Need some more mops
in here!

377
00:20:47,809 --> 00:20:50,210
What exactly
are you looking for?

378
00:20:50,261 --> 00:20:54,081
Blood. If your spinal fluid
is yellow instead of clear,

379
00:20:54,148 --> 00:20:56,083
<i>it means you've had</i>
<i>a subarachnoid hemorrhage.</i>

380
00:20:58,786 --> 00:21:01,738
What does your brother
say to you?

381
00:21:01,823 --> 00:21:03,440
Does he tell you
you're gonna be okay?

382
00:21:05,777 --> 00:21:08,445
Doesn't really
work like that.

383
00:21:08,529 --> 00:21:12,232
I think you hear your brother's
voice for a reason.

384
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:13,900
Thought you guys said
that I hear things

385
00:21:13,968 --> 00:21:15,402
because I'm sick.
Yes.

386
00:21:15,453 --> 00:21:17,704
But that doesn't explain why you
don't hear a different voice.

387
00:21:17,772 --> 00:21:20,240
I think your mom
didn't let you

388
00:21:20,308 --> 00:21:22,609
deal with the grief
of losing your brother properly.

389
00:21:22,677 --> 00:21:25,679
<i>There are people here</i>

390
00:21:25,746 --> 00:21:27,914
who could help you
with that.

391
00:21:31,386 --> 00:21:32,519
Okay.

392
00:21:38,309 --> 00:21:40,277
The opening pressure's
way too high.

393
00:22:00,498 --> 00:22:03,583
The prodigal daughter returns.

394
00:22:05,286 --> 00:22:07,471
You taking me up on my offer
to off you?

395
00:22:07,555 --> 00:22:09,806
Think I've still got
some leftover propofol.

396
00:22:09,891 --> 00:22:12,008
Spoke to Wilson.

397
00:22:12,093 --> 00:22:16,012
He's angry because
I want him to live longer.

398
00:22:16,097 --> 00:22:17,597
Who wouldn't be?

399
00:22:17,648 --> 00:22:19,149
Friends respect
each other's decisions,

400
00:22:19,233 --> 00:22:21,017
even if they don't
agree with them.

401
00:22:21,102 --> 00:22:22,302
It's called loyalty.

402
00:22:22,353 --> 00:22:23,687
Loyalty is a tool

403
00:22:23,771 --> 00:22:25,839
to get people to do things
they don't wanna do.

404
00:22:27,825 --> 00:22:30,360
But you do want to.

405
00:22:30,445 --> 00:22:33,997
You may have rationalized it
a hundred different ways,

406
00:22:34,082 --> 00:22:37,000
but the fact is, you fired me
so that I'd be forced

407
00:22:37,085 --> 00:22:38,452
to spend the rest of my life

408
00:22:38,503 --> 00:22:42,022
doing exactly
what I wanted to do.

409
00:22:42,090 --> 00:22:44,925
It was probably
the most...

410
00:22:44,992 --> 00:22:47,461
selfless thing anyone
has ever done for me.

411
00:22:49,964 --> 00:22:52,599
And you don't even
like me that much.

412
00:23:05,346 --> 00:23:07,847
I surrender.

413
00:23:15,123 --> 00:23:20,160
I have been a disloyal...

414
00:23:20,211 --> 00:23:23,029
disrespectful jerk.

415
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:25,198
I should have listened
to what you wanted.

416
00:23:25,249 --> 00:23:28,635
I'm still not letting
my parents return your call.

417
00:23:28,702 --> 00:23:31,338
I made a reservation for two
at Carmine's.

418
00:23:31,389 --> 00:23:34,007
Tonight. 8:00.

419
00:23:34,058 --> 00:23:37,344
No more tricks.
No more manipulations.

420
00:23:37,395 --> 00:23:39,396
Said Machiavelli.

421
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:41,765
<i>Just...</i>

422
00:23:41,849 --> 00:23:45,051
two friends enjoying
the time they have left.

423
00:23:45,102 --> 00:23:46,686
Please, don't--

424
00:23:46,737 --> 00:23:48,071
I'm not.
I promise.

425
00:23:50,858 --> 00:23:52,659
Just dinner?

426
00:23:52,726 --> 00:23:55,395
That depends on how much
you have to drink.

427
00:23:58,015 --> 00:24:00,834
That sounds nice.

428
00:24:09,781 --> 00:24:10,494
Mom.

429
00:24:10,495 --> 00:24:12,546
I came as soon
as I got your message.

430
00:24:12,613 --> 00:24:14,164
Is he gonna be okay?
We're hoping it's just

431
00:24:14,248 --> 00:24:16,967
excess fluid on his brain
from an extreme migraine,

432
00:24:17,051 --> 00:24:19,636
<i>which isn't good,</i>
<i>but it's treatable.</i>

433
00:24:19,721 --> 00:24:21,254
He's scheduled
to get an MRI

434
00:24:21,306 --> 00:24:23,623
as soon as these meds
start taking effect.

435
00:24:28,813 --> 00:24:32,566
We found that picture
in his dorm room.

436
00:24:32,633 --> 00:24:37,604
I'm not sure
what Derrick's told you, but...

437
00:24:37,655 --> 00:24:41,307
He's been hearing Christopher's
voice for the last ten years.

438
00:24:41,359 --> 00:24:44,177
<i>And it's possible</i>
<i>that repressing</i>

439
00:24:44,245 --> 00:24:45,979
<i>all that grief he's felt</i>

440
00:24:46,030 --> 00:24:48,648
<i>is actually causing</i>
<i>some of Derrick's symptoms.</i>

441
00:24:51,819 --> 00:24:53,153
I don't even know
if this voice in my head

442
00:24:53,204 --> 00:24:54,621
is something I invented

443
00:24:54,672 --> 00:24:56,590
or if it's what Christopher
was really like.

444
00:24:56,657 --> 00:25:00,844
With no photos, no video...

445
00:25:00,928 --> 00:25:03,847
my memories...

446
00:25:03,931 --> 00:25:07,200
I really don't
have any anymore.

447
00:25:09,137 --> 00:25:13,340
Maybe you could just...

448
00:25:13,408 --> 00:25:16,676
tell me a little bit
about him?

449
00:25:20,398 --> 00:25:22,566
I'm sorry.
It was a long drive in.

450
00:25:24,235 --> 00:25:26,236
I'm gonna go get a coffee.

451
00:25:27,739 --> 00:25:28,572
Okay.

452
00:25:35,380 --> 00:25:37,864
97 years old,

453
00:25:37,915 --> 00:25:39,883
and you told her
she was pregnant.

454
00:25:41,502 --> 00:25:42,886
Well, it cured
her hiccups.

455
00:25:45,089 --> 00:25:48,008
I didn't expect her
to cry for quite so long.

456
00:25:49,594 --> 00:25:53,063
Now, I know that
the tiramisu is great here,

457
00:25:53,147 --> 00:25:55,482
but I actually ordered
off-menu.

458
00:26:04,075 --> 00:26:06,159
Great.

459
00:26:06,227 --> 00:26:08,862
I told you, you didn't hang
the bear bag high enough.

460
00:26:08,913 --> 00:26:10,781
It was a smart bear.

461
00:26:10,865 --> 00:26:13,066
I'm almost certain
he untied my knots.

462
00:26:13,117 --> 00:26:14,951
Well, he wasn't that smart.
He left the oreos behind.

463
00:26:15,036 --> 00:26:18,171
You hiked
for 32 miles

464
00:26:18,239 --> 00:26:20,874
eating nothing
but creamy filling.

465
00:26:20,925 --> 00:26:24,344
The black stuff
is overrated.

466
00:26:24,411 --> 00:26:26,797
To climbing the hill.

467
00:26:32,804 --> 00:26:35,388
Okay.

468
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:38,358
If I did decide to...

469
00:26:38,425 --> 00:26:40,310
stick around
a little longer--

470
00:26:40,394 --> 00:26:41,695
Don't do that to me,
Wilson.

471
00:26:41,762 --> 00:26:44,531
No, I'm not, I'm just--

472
00:26:44,599 --> 00:26:47,868
I do feel pretty good
and I...

473
00:26:47,935 --> 00:26:50,504
Maybe I should try it

474
00:26:50,571 --> 00:26:52,622
for a little while.

475
00:26:54,158 --> 00:26:56,209
Well, I...

476
00:26:56,277 --> 00:26:58,745
I think
that's reasonable.

477
00:27:08,756 --> 00:27:10,674
Are you c-conning me?

478
00:27:15,012 --> 00:27:16,179
You're conning me.

479
00:27:16,264 --> 00:27:17,597
Wha--

480
00:27:17,648 --> 00:27:19,465
just because you folded,

481
00:27:19,517 --> 00:27:22,068
that means it must be
some evil plan?

482
00:27:22,136 --> 00:27:25,355
Well, that's usually
how it works with you.

483
00:27:25,439 --> 00:27:27,274
You drown me in nostalgia

484
00:27:27,325 --> 00:27:28,992
so I'll think about
our friendship

485
00:27:29,076 --> 00:27:32,412
and feel some kind of loyalty
and agree to more chemo!

486
00:27:32,479 --> 00:27:33,830
That was real nostalgia.

487
00:27:33,915 --> 00:27:35,448
It was real emotions,
a real decision.

488
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:38,835
A decision
that I just made for you!

489
00:27:44,709 --> 00:27:49,462
I need you, okay?

490
00:27:49,514 --> 00:27:52,899
I want you to be around
as long as possible.

491
00:27:52,967 --> 00:27:54,601
'Cause I don't know what
I'm gonna do without you.

492
00:27:54,668 --> 00:27:55,802
No. No.

493
00:27:55,853 --> 00:27:57,053
Don't do that.

494
00:27:58,306 --> 00:28:00,774
I don't owe you anything.

495
00:28:00,841 --> 00:28:04,144
Our entire relationship
has been about you.

496
00:28:04,195 --> 00:28:06,062
My dying is about me.

497
00:28:56,614 --> 00:28:58,448
Look at you.
You don't wanna die.

498
00:28:58,532 --> 00:29:00,450
Of course,
I don't wanna die!

499
00:29:00,534 --> 00:29:01,785
Well, then fight.

500
00:29:01,869 --> 00:29:03,536
I did! I tried.

501
00:29:03,588 --> 00:29:04,921
One time.

502
00:29:05,006 --> 00:29:06,339
House, get out
of my car.

503
00:29:06,407 --> 00:29:08,074
You don't have to
just accept this.

504
00:29:08,125 --> 00:29:09,843
Yes, I do have to
accept this.

505
00:29:09,910 --> 00:29:11,411
I have five months
to live,

506
00:29:11,462 --> 00:29:15,248
and you're making me
go through this alone!

507
00:29:19,470 --> 00:29:24,474
I'm pissed because I'm dying,
and it's not fair.

508
00:29:24,558 --> 00:29:27,644
And I need...

509
00:29:27,728 --> 00:29:29,479
I need a friend.

510
00:29:29,563 --> 00:29:31,648
I need to know
that you're there.

511
00:29:31,732 --> 00:29:33,600
I need--

512
00:29:35,703 --> 00:29:38,655
I need you to tell me
that my life...

513
00:29:38,739 --> 00:29:43,126
was worthwhile,
and I...

514
00:29:43,210 --> 00:29:45,912
I need you to tell me
that you love me.

515
00:29:56,390 --> 00:29:57,590
No.

516
00:29:57,642 --> 00:30:01,811
I'm not gonna tell you that
unless you fight.

517
00:30:14,975 --> 00:30:17,527
Blood vessels
are nonreactive.

518
00:30:17,611 --> 00:30:19,412
It's not a migraine.

519
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:20,914
<i>I'm not feeling</i>
<i>so great.</i>

520
00:30:20,981 --> 00:30:22,415
How much longer?

521
00:30:22,483 --> 00:30:23,667
Finishing up.

522
00:30:30,041 --> 00:30:32,592
Thank you, Dr. Adams.

523
00:30:36,630 --> 00:30:39,165
It looks like the ceiling
might collapse.

524
00:31:19,538 --> 00:31:21,122
What are you doing
back here?

525
00:31:21,206 --> 00:31:22,740
We got a case.

526
00:31:22,791 --> 00:31:25,075
Assume the status is:
Patient's getting worse.

527
00:31:25,127 --> 00:31:26,610
You guys are confused.

528
00:31:26,661 --> 00:31:29,112
You think actually
showing up for work

529
00:31:29,164 --> 00:31:31,582
is enough to make up for
ruining an MRI,

530
00:31:31,633 --> 00:31:33,134
<i>endangering the patient,</i>

531
00:31:33,218 --> 00:31:34,585
injuring us?

532
00:31:34,636 --> 00:31:36,303
I got an airtight alibi
that I'm working on.

533
00:31:36,388 --> 00:31:37,838
This isn't about
the damage.

534
00:31:37,923 --> 00:31:39,640
You're back because something's
going on with Wilson.

535
00:31:39,724 --> 00:31:41,124
I'm done with Wilson.

536
00:31:41,176 --> 00:31:43,093
What does that mean,
you're done with Wilson?

537
00:31:43,145 --> 00:31:44,812
If he's not dead,
you're not done with Wilson.

538
00:31:44,896 --> 00:31:46,814
You suddenly think
you're gonna make a difference?

539
00:31:46,898 --> 00:31:48,298
You can't just
abandon him.

540
00:31:48,350 --> 00:31:50,100
It's in his hands now.

541
00:31:50,152 --> 00:31:52,987
Get any good pictures
before the MRI drowned?

542
00:31:53,071 --> 00:31:55,272
Enough to know
it wasn't a migraine.

543
00:31:55,323 --> 00:31:58,242
And the patient
mistook me for Adams.

544
00:32:06,084 --> 00:32:08,485
Come with me.

545
00:32:12,657 --> 00:32:14,825
Hey.

546
00:32:14,876 --> 00:32:16,260
So what do you think's
gonna happen

547
00:32:16,327 --> 00:32:18,012
when I stick a needle
into his eardrum?

548
00:32:18,096 --> 00:32:19,013
You quizzing us?

549
00:32:19,097 --> 00:32:21,465
Oh, this is a good quiz.

550
00:32:21,516 --> 00:32:23,333
- He'll scream in pain.
- <i>Don't listen to her.</i>

551
00:32:23,385 --> 00:32:25,502
Very small needle,
very steady hand.

552
00:32:25,554 --> 00:32:26,670
Ah!

553
00:32:26,721 --> 00:32:28,022
Now, when I pull back
on the plunger,

554
00:32:28,106 --> 00:32:29,607
what do you think's
gonna come out?

555
00:32:29,674 --> 00:32:30,507
Air.

556
00:32:36,565 --> 00:32:39,366
Boy, that air
sure is red.

557
00:32:39,451 --> 00:32:41,952
Persistent stapedial artery.

558
00:32:42,020 --> 00:32:44,321
It should disappear
in the embryonic stage,

559
00:32:44,372 --> 00:32:45,573
but just like
his dead brother,

560
00:32:45,657 --> 00:32:47,875
<i>he really can't let go.</i>

561
00:32:47,959 --> 00:32:49,376
An artery's
been pressing against

562
00:32:49,461 --> 00:32:51,412
the temporal lobe of his brain,
right above the ear canal.

563
00:32:51,496 --> 00:32:53,831
It explains the voices,
the dizziness, everything.

564
00:32:53,882 --> 00:32:57,367
Now you guys can explain
how we're gonna make him better.

565
00:33:03,174 --> 00:33:06,543
Will my brother's voice
go away?

566
00:33:11,650 --> 00:33:13,934
You're being an ass.

567
00:33:14,019 --> 00:33:16,403
I just cured a patient.
How 'bout you?

568
00:33:16,488 --> 00:33:17,771
You can't just
give up on Wilson.

569
00:33:17,856 --> 00:33:19,723
You know he needs you.

570
00:33:19,774 --> 00:33:21,391
You know he's making
an impossible choice.

571
00:33:21,443 --> 00:33:22,993
He just doesn't
want to live in pain.

572
00:33:23,061 --> 00:33:25,029
Life is pain!

573
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:26,413
I wake up every morning,
I'm in pain.

574
00:33:26,498 --> 00:33:27,998
I go to work in pain.

575
00:33:28,066 --> 00:33:30,233
You know how many times
I wanted to just give up?

576
00:33:30,285 --> 00:33:32,369
How many times
I thought about ending it?

577
00:33:58,613 --> 00:34:01,598
You here to yell at me
or give me hockey tickets?

578
00:34:01,650 --> 00:34:03,150
Had to delay the surgery

579
00:34:03,234 --> 00:34:05,819
because our patient drank
ammonia from the janitor's cart.

580
00:34:05,904 --> 00:34:07,871
<i>I guess...</i>

581
00:34:07,939 --> 00:34:10,708
He didn't want to live
without his brother's voice.

582
00:34:15,446 --> 00:34:17,915
Where are you going?

583
00:34:23,588 --> 00:34:26,590
You can't wait to die?

584
00:34:26,641 --> 00:34:27,891
Here, let me help you.

585
00:34:27,959 --> 00:34:29,960
Hey!
House!

586
00:34:30,011 --> 00:34:31,895
<i>House!</i>

587
00:34:31,963 --> 00:34:33,981
See? You wanna live!
He did something stupid.

588
00:34:34,065 --> 00:34:35,933
He's not gonna
do it again.

589
00:34:35,984 --> 00:34:37,651
You're resisting me because
it's our human responsibility

590
00:34:37,736 --> 00:34:38,936
to stay alive!

591
00:34:38,987 --> 00:34:40,137
You made your point,
House!

592
00:34:40,188 --> 00:34:41,071
Stop!

593
00:34:53,618 --> 00:34:56,954
You've spent your whole life
looking for the truth.

594
00:34:57,005 --> 00:34:59,540
But sometimes
the truth just sucks.

595
00:35:04,792 --> 00:35:07,044
I'm, uh...

596
00:35:08,049 --> 00:35:09,900
I'm gonna be leaving,
uh,

597
00:35:09,985 --> 00:35:12,603
quite a bit earlier
than we had talked about.

598
00:35:14,222 --> 00:35:17,224
The...next day or two.

599
00:35:17,292 --> 00:35:20,294
What happened?

600
00:35:20,362 --> 00:35:23,030
Something between
you and House?

601
00:35:26,067 --> 00:35:29,253
He's not my child.

602
00:35:29,337 --> 00:35:31,789
I cannot be responsible

603
00:35:31,873 --> 00:35:34,074
for the happiness
of Gregory House.

604
00:35:36,461 --> 00:35:38,929
Well, uh...I'll get
these to Frankel.

605
00:35:39,014 --> 00:35:40,431
Okay. Thank you.

606
00:35:43,134 --> 00:35:45,719
You are responsible.

607
00:35:48,657 --> 00:35:54,762
The past 20 years
you've had three wives,

608
00:35:54,829 --> 00:35:59,333
hundreds of colleagues,
thousands of patients.

609
00:35:59,401 --> 00:36:01,568
But you've kept
that one best friend.

610
00:36:03,738 --> 00:36:06,940
He wants me to suffer
a misery

611
00:36:06,992 --> 00:36:09,076
that I don't want to
go through.

612
00:36:12,714 --> 00:36:15,215
Chemo won't make
your life any better.

613
00:36:15,283 --> 00:36:17,885
But caring will.

614
00:36:17,952 --> 00:36:21,622
Enduring pain to do some good
for someone you care about...

615
00:36:21,690 --> 00:36:23,657
Isn't that what life is?

616
00:37:05,684 --> 00:37:13,474
?

617
00:37:37,699 --> 00:37:38,899
Mom?

618
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:43,203
Yeah?

619
00:37:43,254 --> 00:37:47,441
That picture of Christopher
that I had on the stand.

620
00:37:47,509 --> 00:37:49,910
Did you take it?

621
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:54,448
Yes.

622
00:37:54,516 --> 00:37:57,017
Did you throw it out?

623
00:38:01,489 --> 00:38:03,357
If I agree to get
the surgery,

624
00:38:03,425 --> 00:38:05,359
can you bring
that picture back?

625
00:38:16,538 --> 00:38:24,244
?

626
00:38:39,894 --> 00:38:41,495
- Not home.
<i>-  House.</i>

627
00:38:48,203 --> 00:38:50,120
I'm ready to start
the next round of chemo.

628
00:38:52,357 --> 00:38:54,391
Why?

629
00:38:54,459 --> 00:38:56,193
Because you need me

630
00:38:56,261 --> 00:38:59,079
and...

631
00:38:59,130 --> 00:39:01,465
I don't think
that's a bad thing anymore.

632
00:39:04,452 --> 00:39:06,820
No.

633
00:39:06,888 --> 00:39:11,191
You're the only one
I listen to.

634
00:39:11,259 --> 00:39:12,810
The last couple of days,
I didn't,

635
00:39:12,894 --> 00:39:14,528
and I almost
killed my patient.

636
00:39:14,596 --> 00:39:20,067
So I think it's time
for me to accept that...

637
00:39:20,134 --> 00:39:21,768
you're just smarter
than I am.

638
00:39:25,507 --> 00:39:26,874
Are you really okay

639
00:39:26,941 --> 00:39:30,210
that there's only
five months left?

640
00:39:30,278 --> 00:39:32,179
No.

641
00:39:33,748 --> 00:39:35,315
But it's better
than nothing.

642
00:39:38,870 --> 00:39:41,922
Um...

643
00:39:41,990 --> 00:39:44,007
How do we start?

644
00:39:46,461 --> 00:39:47,861
I'm not gonna say
"I love you."

645
00:39:47,929 --> 00:39:50,797
Thank God.
You got any oreos?

646
00:39:54,802 --> 00:39:57,187
- ? Euphoria, euphoria

647
00:39:57,272 --> 00:40:00,974
? you come at such a price

648
00:40:01,025 --> 00:40:04,645
?

649
00:40:04,696 --> 00:40:06,513
? every time
I hit a home run ?

650
00:40:06,564 --> 00:40:07,898
Hey.

651
00:40:07,982 --> 00:40:09,233
How are you feeling?

652
00:40:15,039 --> 00:40:18,024
The surgery worked.

653
00:40:18,076 --> 00:40:20,594
How can you tell?

654
00:40:20,662 --> 00:40:23,030
'Cause Christopher's
gone.

655
00:40:23,097 --> 00:40:25,883
- ? Perhaps
in that euphoria ?

656
00:40:25,967 --> 00:40:29,253
? you'll be forever mine

657
00:40:32,257 --> 00:40:39,229
?

658
00:40:43,351 --> 00:40:48,388
? ooh

659
00:40:48,439 --> 00:40:52,292
? I want to feel good too

660
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:55,495
?

661
00:40:55,563 --> 00:40:59,917
? ooh

662
00:41:00,001 --> 00:41:03,370
? I wanna feel good too

663
00:41:06,591 --> 00:41:12,012
? ooh

664
00:41:12,079 --> 00:41:15,098
? I wanna feel good too

665
00:41:18,770 --> 00:41:22,189
? ooh

666
00:41:22,256 --> 00:41:27,561
? I wanna feel good too

667
00:41:27,612 --> 00:41:30,731
And this is the peak.
Almost 8,000 feet.

668
00:41:30,782 --> 00:41:34,034
You do realize
that my leg situation

669
00:41:34,101 --> 00:41:35,268
has deteriorated a little

670
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:36,870
since the last time
we went hiking.

671
00:41:36,937 --> 00:41:38,505
Just add another day.

672
00:41:43,161 --> 00:41:47,447
This is Matt Johnson,
the hospital lawyer.

673
00:41:49,917 --> 00:41:51,835
Yes. I have decided
not to proceed

674
00:41:51,919 --> 00:41:53,837
with the sexual
harassment case.

675
00:41:53,921 --> 00:41:56,890
Are these yours?

676
00:41:56,957 --> 00:41:58,642
<i>The plumber retrieved them</i>

677
00:41:58,726 --> 00:42:00,644
from the hospital
outflow pipe.

678
00:42:00,728 --> 00:42:03,963
They caused a sewage backup
that ruined the MRI,

679
00:42:04,015 --> 00:42:05,532
and they have
your name on them.

680
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:07,801
Gregory Danger House.

681
00:42:07,852 --> 00:42:10,153
It's...a very common name.

682
00:42:10,238 --> 00:42:12,856
These apparently have
your fingerprints on them also.

683
00:42:15,827 --> 00:42:17,277
Okay. Why don't you tell me

684
00:42:17,328 --> 00:42:20,113
how many hours of picking up
trash you want me to do.

685
00:42:20,164 --> 00:42:23,250
House...I tried
to keep this internal.

686
00:42:23,317 --> 00:42:27,037
<i>The fire department handed</i>
<i>the tickets to the police</i>

687
00:42:27,121 --> 00:42:29,256
who contacted
your parole officer.

688
00:42:29,323 --> 00:42:32,042
<i>It's felony vandalism.</i>

689
00:42:32,126 --> 00:42:34,094
<i>He's gonna revoke your parole.</i>

690
00:42:34,161 --> 00:42:36,213
There's nothing we can do.

691
00:42:36,297 --> 00:42:38,164
You have to report
to Mercer County Jail on Monday

692
00:42:38,216 --> 00:42:39,883
to serve out the rest
of your sentence.

693
00:42:47,392 --> 00:42:49,893
And that's...
that's how long?

694
00:42:51,579 --> 00:42:52,512
I'm sorry.

695
00:42:52,563 --> 00:42:54,531
How long?

696
00:43:01,205 --> 00:43:02,989
Six months.
