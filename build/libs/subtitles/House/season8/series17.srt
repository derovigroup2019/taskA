1
00:00:08,144 --> 00:00:09,010
<i>Keep breathing.</i>

2
00:00:09,095 --> 00:00:11,062
<i>Nice and slow.</i>

3
00:00:13,149 --> 00:00:14,966
Now, the first
couple of shots

4
00:00:15,017 --> 00:00:16,234
will show you
if the sights are off

5
00:00:16,301 --> 00:00:17,602
or the barrel's bent.

6
00:00:17,653 --> 00:00:19,070
Let me make this
real easy for you.

7
00:00:19,138 --> 00:00:21,573
The sights are off
and the barrel's bent.

8
00:00:25,494 --> 00:00:28,079
Mm, you're off
to the left about an inch.

9
00:00:28,147 --> 00:00:30,949
That's it.
Shoot around the star.

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,200
Not at it.

11
00:00:34,704 --> 00:00:36,504
Yes!
Yeah! You did it!

12
00:00:37,656 --> 00:00:40,175
<i>I</i> didn't.

13
00:00:40,259 --> 00:00:42,326
You just won your girlfriend
a Teddy bear.

14
00:00:42,378 --> 00:00:45,663
Cool. Hey, which one
you think she'd like best?

15
00:00:48,684 --> 00:00:51,553
And then Thursday night,
this physicist

16
00:00:51,637 --> 00:00:53,605
is giving a lecture
in Brooklyn.

17
00:00:53,672 --> 00:00:56,858
It's about time travel
and the grandfather paradox.

18
00:00:56,942 --> 00:00:58,226
I don't know
if you're busy...

19
00:00:58,310 --> 00:01:01,146
Okay, Henry.
Henry...Um...

20
00:01:01,197 --> 00:01:02,814
Can we talk for a second?

21
00:01:02,865 --> 00:01:04,149
Yeah.

22
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:05,366
I'm really happy
that we've been

23
00:01:05,451 --> 00:01:06,735
hanging out so much.

24
00:01:06,819 --> 00:01:09,037
Yeah, I--
I like you too. Heh.

25
00:01:09,121 --> 00:01:11,656
Can you put down the bear?

26
00:01:15,127 --> 00:01:18,580
Henry...

27
00:01:18,664 --> 00:01:20,298
What?

28
00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:25,703
I can't.

29
00:01:25,755 --> 00:01:27,722
I know.

30
00:01:27,807 --> 00:01:29,841
You have a girlfriend.

31
00:01:29,892 --> 00:01:31,092
It's just...

32
00:01:31,177 --> 00:01:32,811
She never seems...

33
00:01:32,878 --> 00:01:36,231
to want to do anything
with you.

34
00:01:36,315 --> 00:01:38,850
Are you crying?

35
00:01:38,901 --> 00:01:40,218
No, I have allergies.

36
00:01:40,269 --> 00:01:42,187
I must just be,
like, tearing up.

37
00:01:42,238 --> 00:01:44,522
Henry, I think
that's blood.

38
00:01:44,573 --> 00:01:47,025
What? I--it...

39
00:01:47,076 --> 00:01:48,443
Oh!

[Massive Attack's <i>Teardrop]</i>

42
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:21,125
?

43
00:02:24,313 --> 00:02:27,265
35-year-old male
cries blood,

44
00:02:27,316 --> 00:02:29,150
and he's not
vampire Bill.

45
00:02:29,235 --> 00:02:30,601
Go!

46
00:02:30,653 --> 00:02:32,270
Should we ask?

47
00:02:32,321 --> 00:02:34,038
Nope!

48
00:02:34,106 --> 00:02:35,323
What, her?

49
00:02:35,407 --> 00:02:37,275
<i>Yeah, my favorite</i>

50
00:02:37,326 --> 00:02:41,079
companion is retiring
from "companning."

51
00:02:41,130 --> 00:02:43,047
So I'm interviewing
replacements.

52
00:02:43,115 --> 00:02:45,283
<i>Thank you...</i>

53
00:02:45,334 --> 00:02:46,718
Butterscotch.

54
00:02:46,785 --> 00:02:48,253
Is that a family name?

55
00:02:48,287 --> 00:02:51,122
How long are you gonna be
using the office for sex games?

56
00:02:51,173 --> 00:02:53,007
Just so I can
plan my day.

57
00:02:53,092 --> 00:02:54,592
Sex and work?

58
00:02:54,643 --> 00:02:55,810
I'm not a savage.

59
00:02:59,064 --> 00:03:00,631
I asked for a cappuccino.

60
00:03:00,683 --> 00:03:01,900
That's what this is.

61
00:03:01,967 --> 00:03:04,285
No, a cappuccino's got
a nice, stiff foam on it.

62
00:03:04,353 --> 00:03:05,486
<i>This is wetter than...</i>

63
00:03:05,571 --> 00:03:09,324
Oh...
almost slipped there.

64
00:03:09,408 --> 00:03:10,441
<i>Well, thank you,</i>

65
00:03:10,492 --> 00:03:11,576
Ms. Scotch,

66
00:03:11,643 --> 00:03:13,244
but poor foaming's
a deal breaker.

67
00:03:13,312 --> 00:03:15,580
Could you ask the next
candidate to come in?

68
00:03:15,647 --> 00:03:17,999
Initial exam showed
no sign of trauma

69
00:03:18,083 --> 00:03:19,817
<i>or subconjunctival</i>
<i>hemorrhage.</i>

70
00:03:19,869 --> 00:03:21,202
<i>Lymphocytosis?</i>

71
00:03:21,287 --> 00:03:22,871
ALC's in normal range,

72
00:03:22,955 --> 00:03:24,155
<i>but it's in the high end</i>
<i>of normal.</i>

73
00:03:24,206 --> 00:03:25,840
Take a seat, Fawn.

74
00:03:25,925 --> 00:03:29,627
And tell me, what's your
favorite Woody Allen movie?

75
00:03:32,882 --> 00:03:33,848
<i>Annie Hall.</i>

76
00:03:33,933 --> 00:03:34,966
You're interviewing hookers

77
00:03:35,017 --> 00:03:36,718
but not gonna
talk to them about sex?

78
00:03:36,802 --> 00:03:37,769
Sex is a given.

79
00:03:37,836 --> 00:03:38,887
They're hookers.

80
00:03:38,971 --> 00:03:40,622
Defend your choice.

81
00:03:40,689 --> 00:03:42,523
It's the most popular.

82
00:03:42,608 --> 00:03:44,909
Ohh...that's so close.

83
00:03:44,977 --> 00:03:46,895
We would have accepted,
"Diane Keaton looks great

84
00:03:46,979 --> 00:03:49,480
in suits," or,
"it's a trenchant commentary

85
00:03:49,531 --> 00:03:51,849
on today's mores,"
or, "I needed the eggs."

86
00:03:51,901 --> 00:03:54,786
Thanks for your interest.

87
00:03:54,853 --> 00:03:56,988
To get the gig,
call girl--

88
00:03:57,039 --> 00:03:58,856
sorry, call <i>woman--</i>

89
00:03:58,908 --> 00:04:02,961
needs a combination of skills
that I find useful/entertaining

90
00:04:03,028 --> 00:04:05,747
for the remaining 57 minutes
of the hour I paid for.

91
00:04:05,831 --> 00:04:07,916
Lymphocytosis works.

92
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,134
Maybe we should take
another look at the blood.

93
00:04:10,202 --> 00:04:12,670
Could also be
cavernous sinus thrombosis.

94
00:04:12,721 --> 00:04:14,472
Clot builds up pressure
at the base of the brain.

95
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:15,890
Rerun the patient's
blood panel

96
00:04:15,975 --> 00:04:17,708
and get a CT venogram
of his head.

97
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:21,479
Let's see which one of you
is right.

98
00:04:21,546 --> 00:04:24,849
How are you
with small appliance repair?

99
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:27,551
Uh, this cavernous sinus thing,

100
00:04:27,603 --> 00:04:28,853
is it dangerous?

101
00:04:28,904 --> 00:04:30,071
If Henry's got it,

102
00:04:30,155 --> 00:04:31,122
<i>we can treat it</i>
<i>with a combo</i>

103
00:04:31,190 --> 00:04:32,991
of drugs and surgery.

104
00:04:33,058 --> 00:04:35,610
Success rate
is over 70%.

105
00:04:35,694 --> 00:04:37,028
Do you want me
to call Amy again?

106
00:04:37,079 --> 00:04:39,730
No, it's fine.

107
00:04:39,782 --> 00:04:41,916
Amy's his girlfriend.

108
00:04:42,001 --> 00:04:44,035
I'm the neighbor.

109
00:04:44,086 --> 00:04:46,120
<i>I did leave a message</i>
<i>at their number.</i>

110
00:04:46,205 --> 00:04:47,588
<i>Do you wanna</i>
<i>try her cell?</i>

111
00:04:47,673 --> 00:04:50,008
Be here for a few
more hours at least.

112
00:04:50,075 --> 00:04:51,909
Oh, she doesn't have one.
She worries about radiation.

113
00:04:51,961 --> 00:04:53,594
<i>I could stop by</i>
<i>on my way home.</i>

114
00:04:53,679 --> 00:04:55,964
She knows
who I am, right?

115
00:04:56,048 --> 00:04:58,082
<i>You don't need to,</i>
<i>but thanks.</i>

116
00:05:00,252 --> 00:05:01,302
Good luck.

117
00:05:01,387 --> 00:05:02,553
Okay.

118
00:05:05,607 --> 00:05:07,892
<i>Have you ever paid for sex?</i>

119
00:05:07,943 --> 00:05:09,894
Every guy who's ever seen
a Merchant Ivory movie

120
00:05:09,945 --> 00:05:11,496
has paid for sex.

121
00:05:11,563 --> 00:05:13,448
No.

122
00:05:13,532 --> 00:05:15,366
It just...

123
00:05:15,434 --> 00:05:17,802
seems too demeaning
to women.

124
00:05:17,870 --> 00:05:19,270
Given the things you've
done to women,

125
00:05:19,321 --> 00:05:22,040
that seems arbitrary.

126
00:05:22,107 --> 00:05:23,774
You're Chi Park, right?

127
00:05:23,826 --> 00:05:25,710
Who's asking?

128
00:05:25,777 --> 00:05:27,778
Uh, you called about
my guitar flyer.

129
00:05:27,830 --> 00:05:29,831
You're Micah.
This guy's selling

130
00:05:29,915 --> 00:05:32,950
a 1974 Gibson SG
standard in tobacco

131
00:05:33,002 --> 00:05:34,218
for $1,250.

132
00:05:34,286 --> 00:05:35,286
<i>Yeah, actually,</i>
<i>I came in to tell you</i>

133
00:05:35,337 --> 00:05:36,654
I already sold it.

134
00:05:36,722 --> 00:05:37,788
Sorry.

135
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:39,090
Oh, um...

136
00:05:39,141 --> 00:05:40,308
Thanks anyway.

137
00:05:46,465 --> 00:05:48,700
Blood panel results
seem pretty much the same

138
00:05:48,767 --> 00:05:50,868
as before,
and that guy likes you.

139
00:05:50,936 --> 00:05:52,937
Maybe we should check
for diabetes.

140
00:05:53,005 --> 00:05:54,372
Could weaken
conjunctival vessels.

141
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:55,523
And shut up.

142
00:05:55,607 --> 00:05:58,309
If I'm wrong,
then why is he coming back?

143
00:06:00,245 --> 00:06:01,812
My band is rehearsing
tomorrow night.

144
00:06:01,864 --> 00:06:03,781
You should come by
and jam with us.

145
00:06:03,832 --> 00:06:06,484
That...sounds fun.

146
00:06:06,535 --> 00:06:08,503
I'll think about it.

147
00:06:08,587 --> 00:06:10,338
Great. Call me.

148
00:06:12,991 --> 00:06:14,876
Park has a boyfriend.

149
00:06:14,943 --> 00:06:16,561
I'll break your face.

150
00:06:24,186 --> 00:06:26,187
This is the talent portion
of the interview.

151
00:06:26,271 --> 00:06:27,171
<i>Okay.</i>

152
00:06:27,222 --> 00:06:28,973
You like cards.

153
00:06:29,024 --> 00:06:31,008
<i>But you can juggle.</i>

154
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:32,777
I fail to see how this would be
of benefit to you.

155
00:06:32,844 --> 00:06:34,529
What if I'm busy?

156
00:06:34,613 --> 00:06:35,679
Have you got anything else?

157
00:06:35,731 --> 00:06:37,181
Sure.

158
00:06:41,653 --> 00:06:44,489
CT showed no clots
or malformations.

159
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:47,858
Park and Taub ruled out
lymphocytosis and diabetes.

160
00:06:47,910 --> 00:06:49,744
Well, since you have
nothing of relevance

161
00:06:49,828 --> 00:06:52,080
to report, I assume
that you're here

162
00:06:52,164 --> 00:06:54,248
to toss your panties
in the ring.

163
00:06:54,333 --> 00:06:55,399
<i>Patient's got</i>
<i>a mysterious girlfriend</i>

164
00:06:55,467 --> 00:06:56,667
<i>he really wants to see.</i>

165
00:06:56,718 --> 00:06:58,886
She's unreachable by phone,

166
00:06:58,971 --> 00:06:59,887
<i>and the neighbor's</i>
<i>never even seen her.</i>

167
00:06:59,972 --> 00:07:01,272
What do you think?

168
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:03,558
He's gay.

169
00:07:03,642 --> 00:07:05,860
I think he's a junkie.

170
00:07:05,928 --> 00:07:07,578
The girlfriend is a fix.

171
00:07:07,646 --> 00:07:09,514
<i>The guy's inhaling glue.</i>

172
00:07:09,581 --> 00:07:11,048
Can you repair a blender?

173
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:12,934
Can you bite me?

174
00:07:13,018 --> 00:07:14,552
Go search the patient's home.

175
00:07:18,023 --> 00:07:19,857
Well, thank you, ladies.

176
00:07:19,908 --> 00:07:22,777
I've seen a lot of very
talented candidates.

177
00:07:22,861 --> 00:07:24,562
Got a tough decision
the next few days.

178
00:07:25,948 --> 00:07:27,532
This is the part I hate.

179
00:07:43,015 --> 00:07:46,050
Well...this is not
exactly a crack den.

180
00:07:46,101 --> 00:07:48,919
Doesn't exactly look like
a woman lives here, either.

181
00:07:50,939 --> 00:07:52,690
"To Amy.

182
00:07:52,757 --> 00:07:54,926
I love you."

183
00:07:54,993 --> 00:07:56,927
Okay. She exists.

184
00:07:56,979 --> 00:08:00,731
Doesn't mean
he's not a drug addict.

185
00:08:00,782 --> 00:08:02,984
It's good you're playing it
cool with House.

186
00:08:03,068 --> 00:08:04,318
<i>Once he gets a rise</i>
<i>out of someone...</i>

187
00:08:04,403 --> 00:08:05,903
Yeah, I'm not crazy about
the whole hooker thing,

188
00:08:05,954 --> 00:08:06,937
but I get it.

189
00:08:06,989 --> 00:08:08,406
Other than the fact

190
00:08:08,473 --> 00:08:10,408
that it's exploitative
and dangerous for women,

191
00:08:10,459 --> 00:08:13,544
you get what you need without
any of the emotional baggage.

192
00:08:13,612 --> 00:08:16,164
You're not seeing
anyone, I take it.

193
00:08:16,248 --> 00:08:18,449
I've been volunteering
at the Trenton Free Clinic.

194
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:19,750
Keeps me busy.

195
00:08:19,801 --> 00:08:22,803
You volunteer every night
and every weekend?

196
00:08:22,888 --> 00:08:24,305
No time to grab dinner?

197
00:08:24,389 --> 00:08:25,673
What's more important--

198
00:08:25,757 --> 00:08:27,425
making small talk
over ravioli

199
00:08:27,476 --> 00:08:29,960
<i>or helping people</i>
<i>who are less fortunate?</i>

200
00:08:30,012 --> 00:08:31,012
With that rationale,

201
00:08:31,096 --> 00:08:32,296
none of us
should ever eat again.

202
00:08:32,347 --> 00:08:35,132
Let's just say
I'm not hungry right now.

203
00:08:37,769 --> 00:08:40,605
Oh, God...

204
00:08:40,656 --> 00:08:42,657
I don't think
she's breathing.

205
00:08:42,741 --> 00:08:45,193
Do you think
she OD'd?

206
00:08:45,277 --> 00:08:46,694
That or he killed her.

207
00:08:46,778 --> 00:08:47,678
Pulse?

208
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:52,650
No.

209
00:08:52,701 --> 00:08:53,868
I'll call the coroner.

210
00:08:53,952 --> 00:08:56,170
I don't think that's
gonna be necessary.

211
00:08:59,341 --> 00:09:01,659
This one works
in financial district.

212
00:09:01,710 --> 00:09:03,461
She can get tips,
give you leg up in market.

213
00:09:05,013 --> 00:09:06,797
What is "fudgey Gonzalez"?

214
00:09:06,848 --> 00:09:10,885
Uh, imagine
a "vanilla Gonzalez,"

215
00:09:10,969 --> 00:09:13,004
but from the other side.

216
00:09:20,779 --> 00:09:22,680
I'm about to make
a decision,

217
00:09:22,731 --> 00:09:25,015
but there's still time for you
to sneak under the wire.

218
00:09:25,067 --> 00:09:26,200
My favorite
Woody Allen movie

219
00:09:26,285 --> 00:09:27,418
is <i>Melinda and Melinda.</i>

220
00:09:27,486 --> 00:09:30,521
<i>Our patient is not a junkie,</i>

221
00:09:30,572 --> 00:09:33,124
but he does have a girlfriend.

222
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:44,161
I call her my "girlfriend"
because people understand that.

223
00:09:44,644 --> 00:09:45,777
If I explained it,

224
00:09:45,828 --> 00:09:47,379
they'd just think
I was a weirdo.

225
00:09:47,446 --> 00:09:50,782
We're not here
to judge anyone's fetish.

226
00:09:50,833 --> 00:09:51,833
I'm not a pervert.

227
00:09:51,918 --> 00:09:53,919
It's not like
I'm more attracted

228
00:09:53,970 --> 00:09:55,921
to dolls than humans.

229
00:09:55,972 --> 00:09:57,672
So you don't have sex
with her?

230
00:09:59,091 --> 00:10:00,809
It's not just about that.

231
00:10:00,893 --> 00:10:04,379
Does the doll talk to you?

232
00:10:04,447 --> 00:10:06,848
I know she's not
a real person.

233
00:10:06,933 --> 00:10:09,434
In a lot of ways,
she's better than a person.

234
00:10:09,485 --> 00:10:11,686
<i>I can tell her things,</i>
<i>and she won't</i>

235
00:10:11,771 --> 00:10:14,138
argue with me
or make fun of me.

236
00:10:14,190 --> 00:10:15,807
I come home every night,

237
00:10:15,858 --> 00:10:17,576
and I know
she'll be there waiting.

238
00:10:17,643 --> 00:10:19,211
So is your toaster.

239
00:10:21,848 --> 00:10:23,815
No one in the world
has an emotional attachment

240
00:10:23,866 --> 00:10:25,617
to a toaster.

241
00:10:25,668 --> 00:10:28,587
But a lot of people
are willing to spend $7,000

242
00:10:28,654 --> 00:10:30,956
<i>on women like Amy.</i>

243
00:10:31,023 --> 00:10:33,041
Have you ever tried
an actual--

244
00:10:33,125 --> 00:10:34,709
<i>Yeah, I'm 35.</i>

245
00:10:34,794 --> 00:10:38,597
I've been in relationships.
Just none of them fulfilled me.

246
00:10:38,664 --> 00:10:40,465
And one day,
I saw this website,

247
00:10:40,516 --> 00:10:44,836
and...maybe the perfect woman's
out there somewhere,

248
00:10:44,887 --> 00:10:48,323
but it's not worth
going through

249
00:10:48,391 --> 00:10:51,142
<i>what it would take</i>
<i>to find her.</i>

250
00:10:52,361 --> 00:10:53,862
Amy makes me happy.

251
00:10:56,315 --> 00:10:57,148
<i>You're swelling.</i>

252
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,017
It's sort
of hot in here.

253
00:10:59,068 --> 00:11:01,403
Not that hot.

254
00:11:03,089 --> 00:11:04,522
Bleeding plus
two more symptoms:

255
00:11:04,574 --> 00:11:06,208
Fever and neurological.

256
00:11:06,292 --> 00:11:07,792
I'm not sure about
that last one.

257
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:10,078
I think he's just...weird.

258
00:11:10,162 --> 00:11:11,379
He wasn't hallucinating.

259
00:11:11,464 --> 00:11:13,131
He didn't have
a thought disorder.

260
00:11:13,198 --> 00:11:14,799
And you don't think
it's "disordered" to talk to--

261
00:11:14,867 --> 00:11:15,917
It's not all that different

262
00:11:16,002 --> 00:11:18,386
from talking to your cat
or a Teddy bear.

263
00:11:18,471 --> 00:11:21,089
You don't have sex
with your cat or Teddy bear.

264
00:11:21,173 --> 00:11:22,724
If you did,

265
00:11:22,808 --> 00:11:25,427
you'd probably talk
to them more.

266
00:11:25,511 --> 00:11:27,812
Guy loves an imaginary being

267
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:29,681
who's never going
to respond to him.

268
00:11:29,732 --> 00:11:32,817
He's no crazier than
millions of churchgoers.

269
00:11:32,885 --> 00:11:36,271
You think anything off
about any patient is a symptom.

270
00:11:36,355 --> 00:11:37,939
This guy buys flowers.

271
00:11:38,024 --> 00:11:40,892
<i>Real</i> flowers for
a piece of plastic in a dress.

272
00:11:40,943 --> 00:11:42,944
You know
what's really crazy?

273
00:11:43,029 --> 00:11:45,497
Living with a human being.

274
00:11:45,564 --> 00:11:47,999
Someone with
opinions and feelings.

275
00:11:48,067 --> 00:11:50,201
Gets mad just 'cause
you want to take Salsa classes

276
00:11:50,253 --> 00:11:51,836
with them one night a week.

277
00:11:51,904 --> 00:11:52,904
One night.

278
00:11:52,955 --> 00:11:54,756
He's just running away.

279
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:56,007
He hangs out with a doll,

280
00:11:56,075 --> 00:11:58,043
he never needs
to fear rejection.

281
00:11:58,094 --> 00:11:59,210
It's sad.

282
00:11:59,278 --> 00:12:01,012
You do understand
the irony here?

283
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:02,847
Every person in this room
has a sex doll.

284
00:12:02,915 --> 00:12:04,182
<i>At least the patient</i>
<i>has the stones</i>

285
00:12:04,249 --> 00:12:06,250
to be honest about it.

286
00:12:06,302 --> 00:12:07,269
Ooh, a metaphor.

287
00:12:07,353 --> 00:12:08,720
What you didn't foresee
is that

288
00:12:08,771 --> 00:12:10,105
is that I actually do have
a sex doll.

289
00:12:10,189 --> 00:12:11,273
Your doll is your kids.

290
00:12:11,357 --> 00:12:13,257
Yours is your parents,

291
00:12:13,309 --> 00:12:14,592
<i>yours is your charity.</i>

292
00:12:14,644 --> 00:12:16,544
All excuses for not being
in a relationship.

293
00:12:16,612 --> 00:12:18,429
He's not wrong.

294
00:12:18,481 --> 00:12:19,648
And you--

295
00:12:19,732 --> 00:12:21,116
I have meaningless sex
with random strangers.

296
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,284
Thanks for the insight,

297
00:12:22,368 --> 00:12:23,902
but I stopped that
months ago.

298
00:12:23,953 --> 00:12:24,769
I actually had
a relationship.

299
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:26,604
With a patient.

300
00:12:26,656 --> 00:12:29,240
You just date whoever happens
to cross your path.

301
00:12:29,292 --> 00:12:31,776
My dating is getting
in the way of my dating?

302
00:12:31,827 --> 00:12:33,277
<i>You don't go looking for</i>
<i>the right person.</i>

303
00:12:33,329 --> 00:12:34,913
You just shack up
with whoever's in the room,

304
00:12:34,964 --> 00:12:36,748
and then you get surprised
and/or divorced

305
00:12:36,799 --> 00:12:38,116
when it doesn't work out.

306
00:12:38,167 --> 00:12:40,218
I'm surprised
you haven't asked Adams out yet.

307
00:12:43,288 --> 00:12:45,824
Uh, for your information,

308
00:12:45,891 --> 00:12:47,258
I've got a date tonight.

309
00:12:47,310 --> 00:12:48,893
I'll be jamming with
a cute guy and his band.

310
00:12:48,961 --> 00:12:50,145
- You'll bail.
<i>-  He's right.</i>

311
00:12:50,229 --> 00:12:51,513
<i>The obvious solution</i>
<i>is for me to</i>

312
00:12:51,597 --> 00:12:52,797
hand my kids over
to your parents.

313
00:12:52,848 --> 00:12:54,516
Can we stop trying to argue
the premise

314
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:55,984
and move onto figuring out
why it is

315
00:12:56,068 --> 00:12:57,686
that you're all social morons?

316
00:12:57,770 --> 00:12:59,688
You do understand
the irony here.

317
00:12:59,772 --> 00:13:02,440
You mocking us
for avoiding relationships,

318
00:13:02,508 --> 00:13:04,609
but you can't handle
losing your "doll."

319
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:06,144
<i>Your spending</i>
<i>all this time and energy</i>

320
00:13:06,195 --> 00:13:09,180
interviewing for a new one.

321
00:13:10,633 --> 00:13:13,618
You're right.
That is stupid.

322
00:13:15,671 --> 00:13:18,623
What about the patient?

323
00:13:18,674 --> 00:13:20,625
Dude's banging a sex doll.

324
00:13:20,693 --> 00:13:24,429
<i>A festering cesspool of bodily</i>
<i>fluids and associated bacteria.</i>

325
00:13:24,496 --> 00:13:26,131
Swab her out
and find out which one.

326
00:13:28,801 --> 00:13:30,301
I need you.

327
00:13:30,353 --> 00:13:32,187
Please don't quit.

328
00:13:32,271 --> 00:13:35,306
You're the only hooker
I know who can tune a piano.

329
00:13:35,358 --> 00:13:36,725
If it's about the money,

330
00:13:36,809 --> 00:13:39,527
then I can up you
to three nights a week.

331
00:13:39,612 --> 00:13:43,347
I'm getting married, House.

332
00:13:43,399 --> 00:13:45,283
His name's Harris.

333
00:13:45,350 --> 00:13:47,035
He's a certified accountant,

334
00:13:47,119 --> 00:13:48,853
he's loves
schlocky horror movies,

335
00:13:48,904 --> 00:13:50,372
and he just moved in.

336
00:13:50,456 --> 00:13:52,240
We're very happy.

337
00:13:54,910 --> 00:13:56,544
Well, you're happy?

338
00:13:56,629 --> 00:13:58,413
Yeah, you're happy
because he doesn't know

339
00:13:58,497 --> 00:13:59,914
about your employment history.

340
00:13:59,999 --> 00:14:01,082
He knows.

341
00:14:01,167 --> 00:14:02,700
We've talked about it,

342
00:14:02,768 --> 00:14:04,169
and he accepts me
for who I am.

343
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:07,255
No. He...

344
00:14:07,339 --> 00:14:08,640
If he accepted who you were,

345
00:14:08,707 --> 00:14:10,759
he would not be making
you give up your career.

346
00:14:10,843 --> 00:14:13,011
Women need
their own identities,

347
00:14:13,062 --> 00:14:14,596
their own livelihoods.

348
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:19,267
Otherwise, why was I smoking
all those Virginia Slims?

349
00:14:19,351 --> 00:14:21,936
I know this is weird
for you,

350
00:14:22,021 --> 00:14:26,157
but you need to figure out
a way to be okay with it.

351
00:14:26,225 --> 00:14:28,443
I'll miss you, too.

352
00:14:53,102 --> 00:14:56,420
I feel like the stirrups
are overkill.

353
00:14:56,472 --> 00:14:58,389
I've never done a pelvic
on a doll before.

354
00:14:58,441 --> 00:15:02,610
I'm unfamiliar
with the protocol.

355
00:15:02,695 --> 00:15:04,428
I'm pretty skeeved out
right now.

356
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:05,814
I'm not gonna lie.

357
00:15:05,898 --> 00:15:06,865
What House
said back there--

358
00:15:06,932 --> 00:15:08,432
House says
a lot of things.

359
00:15:08,484 --> 00:15:10,001
I don't just date
whoever shows up.

360
00:15:10,069 --> 00:15:13,071
I mean, I did meet women
in the hospital,

361
00:15:13,122 --> 00:15:14,906
but they weren't
just flings.

362
00:15:14,957 --> 00:15:16,374
Basically, you're explaining

363
00:15:16,441 --> 00:15:17,625
why you're not going
to ask me out.

364
00:15:17,710 --> 00:15:18,943
That's not what I was--

365
00:15:20,813 --> 00:15:22,714
did you want me
to ask you out?

366
00:15:23,966 --> 00:15:24,799
Yeah.

367
00:15:24,884 --> 00:15:26,918
I told Park to tell Taub

368
00:15:26,969 --> 00:15:28,603
to tell House
to pass you that note.

369
00:15:31,290 --> 00:15:32,590
It's completely clean
in there.

370
00:15:32,641 --> 00:15:36,127
He said
he just bathed her.

371
00:15:37,296 --> 00:15:38,680
Adams...

372
00:15:38,764 --> 00:15:41,766
there's a swelling
beneath the skin...

373
00:15:41,817 --> 00:15:45,469
3-inch mass.

374
00:15:45,521 --> 00:15:47,471
Is it...

375
00:15:47,523 --> 00:15:49,657
Part of the doll's skeleton?

376
00:15:49,742 --> 00:15:51,642
It feels like a tumor.

377
00:16:05,384 --> 00:16:08,486
CT showed an air-filled mass
in the doll's abdomen.

378
00:16:08,493 --> 00:16:10,444
It's probably just
a chemical reaction.

379
00:16:10,495 --> 00:16:13,197
Henry left her too close
to a heating pipe or something.

380
00:16:13,281 --> 00:16:14,982
This guy brushes her hair
every morning,

381
00:16:15,033 --> 00:16:17,034
brings home movies for them
to watch together.

382
00:16:17,119 --> 00:16:18,619
You think he tosses her
in a broom closet

383
00:16:18,670 --> 00:16:19,987
at the end of each day?

384
00:16:20,038 --> 00:16:23,057
More likely than
<i>it</i> getting stomach cancer.

385
00:16:23,125 --> 00:16:24,925
How about clostridium?

386
00:16:24,993 --> 00:16:26,961
Bacteria got trapped in
the airtight cavity,

387
00:16:27,012 --> 00:16:28,495
produced gas...

388
00:16:28,547 --> 00:16:30,348
It doesn't explain
the neurological issue.

389
00:16:30,432 --> 00:16:31,832
We can explain that
the same way

390
00:16:31,883 --> 00:16:33,968
we explain
the tooth fairy.

391
00:16:36,138 --> 00:16:38,839
Oh, I get
to play Solomon.

392
00:16:38,890 --> 00:16:40,725
Cut the doll open.

393
00:16:40,809 --> 00:16:42,509
We can't just destroy
the patient's property.

394
00:16:42,561 --> 00:16:44,111
That thing cost 7 grand.

395
00:16:44,179 --> 00:16:46,180
Exactly.
Ask him for consent.

396
00:16:46,231 --> 00:16:47,514
<i>If he says yes,</i>

397
00:16:47,566 --> 00:16:49,116
then we get to
go hunting bacteria.

398
00:16:49,184 --> 00:16:50,818
<i>If he says no, there's no need</i>
<i>because he's crazy,</i>

399
00:16:50,869 --> 00:16:52,703
and we need a different theory.

400
00:16:52,788 --> 00:16:53,738
See ya.

401
00:16:53,822 --> 00:16:55,823
Gotta go build a temple.

402
00:16:59,628 --> 00:17:01,595
Okay.

403
00:17:01,663 --> 00:17:03,047
You sure?

404
00:17:03,131 --> 00:17:05,049
It won't be able to heal
when we're done.

405
00:17:05,133 --> 00:17:08,169
But you think she could tell you
what's wrong with me.

406
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:10,704
<i>Yes.</i>

407
00:17:12,424 --> 00:17:14,475
Okay.

408
00:17:25,220 --> 00:17:27,104
Should we take her
to the procedure room?

409
00:17:27,189 --> 00:17:29,490
It's not a her, which means
we can do this anywhere.

410
00:17:36,832 --> 00:17:38,365
<i>Adams...</i>

411
00:17:38,417 --> 00:17:39,733
You can know
something's not real

412
00:17:39,785 --> 00:17:41,619
and still love it.

413
00:17:49,911 --> 00:17:54,515
I think the procedure room
might be better for this.

414
00:18:02,691 --> 00:18:04,291
You are a horrible person.

415
00:18:06,495 --> 00:18:08,696
All I need is to break up
one marriage.

416
00:18:08,763 --> 00:18:10,197
You've broken up
three of your own.

417
00:18:10,265 --> 00:18:13,734
You're like the Stephen Hawking
of killing relationships.

418
00:18:13,785 --> 00:18:15,069
Actually, no,
Stephen Hawking

419
00:18:15,137 --> 00:18:16,137

420
00:18:16,204 --> 00:18:19,156
Okay.
I have work to do.

421
00:18:19,241 --> 00:18:20,658
<i>Your computer is off.</i>

422
00:18:20,742 --> 00:18:23,210
Sorry, I can't hear you
over my "stereo."

423
00:18:23,278 --> 00:18:24,278
<i>Why do you assume</i>
<i>that marriage</i>

424
00:18:24,329 --> 00:18:26,881
is better than hooking?

425
00:18:26,948 --> 00:18:27,882
We don't know anything
about the guy.

426
00:18:27,949 --> 00:18:28,883
He could be
a serial killer.

427
00:18:28,950 --> 00:18:30,468
Even if that were true,

428
00:18:30,552 --> 00:18:32,336
it would still be a toss-up.

429
00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:34,621
What kind of guy
marries a hooker?

430
00:18:34,673 --> 00:18:35,890
Somebody who hires hookers.

431
00:18:35,957 --> 00:18:38,058
And someone who hires hookers

432
00:18:38,126 --> 00:18:40,427
is not exactly
the monogamous type.

433
00:18:40,479 --> 00:18:42,396
If we expose him
as a cheater...

434
00:18:42,463 --> 00:18:43,481
You're a coward.

435
00:18:43,565 --> 00:18:44,899
Would a coward
fight to the end

436
00:18:44,966 --> 00:18:48,352
to save a damsel in
soon-to-be-proved distress?

437
00:18:48,436 --> 00:18:50,571
Absolutely, if what
he's afraid of is other damsels.

438
00:18:50,638 --> 00:18:53,307
Your last relationship
failed so miserably,

439
00:18:53,358 --> 00:18:54,492
you ended up in jail.

440
00:18:54,576 --> 00:18:56,443
Now you're clinging
to this hooker

441
00:18:56,495 --> 00:18:58,779
when there are about
3 billion other women out there

442
00:18:58,830 --> 00:19:00,480
who aren't call girls,

443
00:19:00,532 --> 00:19:02,316
some of whom are attractive
and intelligent,

444
00:19:02,367 --> 00:19:04,818
one of whom is living
in your apartment

445
00:19:04,870 --> 00:19:07,588
and is married to you!

446
00:19:10,592 --> 00:19:13,327
You're right.

447
00:19:13,378 --> 00:19:15,129
Why am I asking you
for help?

448
00:19:22,170 --> 00:19:23,804
You shouldn't sleep

449
00:19:23,855 --> 00:19:26,807
Thank, God.
You got here just in time.

450
00:19:26,858 --> 00:19:28,792
What do you have
against him?

451
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:30,978
Nothing,
but House has a way

452
00:19:31,029 --> 00:19:32,196
<i>of getting</i>
<i>into people's heads.</i>

453
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:33,647
Just like last week

454
00:19:33,698 --> 00:19:36,016
when he was prying into
your relationship with Chase?

455
00:19:36,067 --> 00:19:39,286
It was silly then,
and it's silly now.

456
00:19:39,354 --> 00:19:41,188
Why was it silly then?

457
00:19:41,239 --> 00:19:44,074
I'm not 5'9" with curves
and flowing hair,

458
00:19:44,159 --> 00:19:46,026
so it's impossible for me
to get it on

459
00:19:46,077 --> 00:19:47,661
with a good-looking guy?

460
00:19:47,712 --> 00:19:49,830
Wow.
Do you resent me?

463
00:19:56,137 --> 00:19:59,206
If you're not getting any,
it's not my fault.

00:20:04,396 --> 00:20:07,398

the panda on it or the bird?

465
00:20:07,482 --> 00:20:09,099
Good choice.

466
00:20:09,184 --> 00:20:11,569
Pandas eat only bamboo,

467
00:20:11,653 --> 00:20:14,488
<i>they know nothing about cereal.</i>

468
00:20:16,741 --> 00:20:20,077

We're growing cultures now,

485
00:21:16,001 --> 00:21:19,336
but she looked clean,
and there was no telltale smell.

486
00:21:19,421 --> 00:21:20,971
I'm guessing the lump
was just an air bubble

00:23:08,180 --> 00:23:09,798
- Great.
<i>-  Does she look like she's lying?</i>

533
00:23:09,882 --> 00:23:10,849
Kind of.

534
00:23:10,916 --> 00:23:13,968
Popo needed a ride
to the doctor,

535
00:23:14,053 --> 00:23:15,270
<i>and my mom couldn't,</i>
<i>so--</i>

536
00:23:15,354 --> 00:23:19,590
You're terrified of dating
because...

537
00:23:19,642 --> 00:23:22,927
<i>a previous relationship ended</i>
<i>because your latent rage</i>

538
00:23:22,978 --> 00:23:24,896
made you vicious in arguments.

539
00:23:24,947 --> 00:23:26,131
Or--

540
00:23:26,198 --> 00:23:27,365
<i>Or reincarnation.</i>

541
00:23:27,433 --> 00:23:28,933
In a past life,
she was Anne Boleyn.

542
00:23:28,984 --> 00:23:29,801
<i>Interesting.</i>

543
00:23:29,869 --> 00:23:31,602
Taub feels confident enough

544
00:23:31,654 --> 00:23:33,872
to turn the spotlight
on himself.

545
00:23:33,939 --> 00:23:36,374
<i>It's almost as</i>
<i>if he wants me to ask...</i>

546
00:23:36,442 --> 00:23:37,575
What's her name?

547
00:23:37,626 --> 00:23:38,943
<i>Wendy Jacobson.</i>

548
00:23:38,994 --> 00:23:41,129
33, Brown grad,
family therapist.

549
00:23:41,213 --> 00:23:42,630
<i>Nice choice.</i>

550
00:23:42,715 --> 00:23:44,049
Since you got two families
to "therapize."

551
00:23:44,116 --> 00:23:45,300
<i>First date,</i>

552
00:23:45,384 --> 00:23:46,468
we didn't discuss everything
important--

553
00:23:46,552 --> 00:23:49,170
So it was just
a one-night stand.

554
00:23:49,255 --> 00:23:52,006
You're wrong.
I actually like her.

555
00:23:52,091 --> 00:23:53,224
I'm going to see her again.

556
00:23:53,292 --> 00:23:55,226
<i>Mazel tov.</i>

557
00:23:55,294 --> 00:23:57,962
Great relationships often start
with snap decisions

558
00:23:58,013 --> 00:23:59,630
<i>aimed at proving me wrong.</i>

559
00:23:59,682 --> 00:24:02,500
Air bubble in the doll could
mean the silicone is degrading.

560
00:24:02,568 --> 00:24:03,935
<i>If he hailed some particles...</i>

561
00:24:04,003 --> 00:24:05,737
Silicone deposition.

562
00:24:05,804 --> 00:24:07,572
That could work.

563
00:24:07,639 --> 00:24:09,908
Start him on plasmapheresis.

564
00:24:09,975 --> 00:24:11,943
Now, turning to Adams,

565
00:24:11,994 --> 00:24:13,945
my theory is tripartite--

566
00:24:16,449 --> 00:24:17,982
Want to hear my thesis?

567
00:24:18,033 --> 00:24:19,667
It's kind of interesting.

568
00:24:19,752 --> 00:24:22,653
No man comes out.

569
00:24:22,705 --> 00:24:28,126
But old naked lady in 3-C
is eating whole block of cheese.

570
00:24:28,177 --> 00:24:29,961
Will this hurt?

571
00:24:30,012 --> 00:24:32,464
No, you might feel
a little cold, though.

572
00:24:32,515 --> 00:24:34,299
Crap.

573
00:24:34,350 --> 00:24:35,133
<i>Hey.</i>

574
00:24:35,184 --> 00:24:36,851
I only have a second,

575
00:24:36,936 --> 00:24:38,503
but I went to
the time travel lecture.

576
00:24:38,554 --> 00:24:40,939
Ah.

577
00:24:41,006 --> 00:24:43,808
Whoa.

578
00:24:43,859 --> 00:24:48,513
That is...awesome.

579
00:24:48,564 --> 00:24:52,117
What is it?

580
00:24:52,184 --> 00:24:54,819
It's so...

581
00:24:54,870 --> 00:24:58,656
Oh, realistic.

582
00:24:58,707 --> 00:25:00,542
Oh, and it's all bandaged up.

583
00:25:02,861 --> 00:25:05,263
It is one of those
CPR things?

584
00:25:05,331 --> 00:25:07,698
No.

585
00:25:07,750 --> 00:25:08,699
We're starting a procedure.

586
00:25:08,751 --> 00:25:10,218
A little privacy--

587
00:25:10,302 --> 00:25:13,388
No, no, it's--
it's good that she's here.

588
00:25:13,472 --> 00:25:15,390
<i>Molly,</i>

589
00:25:15,474 --> 00:25:18,643
I'd like you
to meet Amy.

590
00:25:20,212 --> 00:25:21,563
What?

591
00:25:21,630 --> 00:25:25,216
I'm serious.

592
00:25:25,267 --> 00:25:27,886
I know it seems
a little strange,

593
00:25:27,953 --> 00:25:31,940
<i>but she means a lot to me.</i>

594
00:25:33,659 --> 00:25:38,363
I, um, got
to get back to work.

595
00:25:38,414 --> 00:25:40,398
But you just got here.
Sit down.

596
00:25:40,449 --> 00:25:41,749
<i>Yeah, but I--</i>

597
00:25:41,834 --> 00:25:44,752
I said that I only had a second.

598
00:25:48,007 --> 00:25:50,842
Enjoy the handouts.

599
00:26:06,058 --> 00:26:08,459
<i>Whoa.</i>

600
00:26:16,952 --> 00:26:20,438
Listen, um,
I have to admit something.

601
00:26:20,489 --> 00:26:22,407
Okay.

602
00:26:27,779 --> 00:26:29,614
Her mom isn't dead.

603
00:26:29,665 --> 00:26:31,716
We're separated.

604
00:26:31,784 --> 00:26:34,002
Uh-huh.

605
00:26:34,086 --> 00:26:37,589
You're the first person
I've asked out since then.

606
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:41,792
I'm not used to explaining...
I panicked.

607
00:26:41,844 --> 00:26:44,729
Which I regret, because now
that I've gotten to know you,

608
00:26:44,797 --> 00:26:48,483
I like you.

609
00:26:48,567 --> 00:26:51,519
It was a really stupid lie.

610
00:26:51,604 --> 00:26:53,804
I'm sorry.

611
00:26:54,973 --> 00:26:56,974
Was that a different baby?

612
00:26:59,878 --> 00:27:01,946
No...

613
00:27:03,499 --> 00:27:04,682
That was a different baby.

614
00:27:26,305 --> 00:27:29,023
It's nice having you here.

615
00:27:29,108 --> 00:27:32,243
I wish you could come over
and get in bed with me.

616
00:27:38,067 --> 00:27:39,784
Like this?

617
00:27:39,851 --> 00:27:42,019
You're talking?

618
00:27:42,071 --> 00:27:43,404
It's not all I can do.

619
00:28:00,222 --> 00:28:02,223
Amy, there are doctors...

620
00:28:02,308 --> 00:28:04,092
Shh...

621
00:28:04,176 --> 00:28:05,943
I don't know.

622
00:28:06,011 --> 00:28:09,597
Just put your hands on me.

623
00:28:24,780 --> 00:28:26,897
It hurts.

624
00:28:26,949 --> 00:28:28,116
It hurts...

625
00:28:40,512 --> 00:28:42,680
Pushing Lorazepam.

626
00:28:42,748 --> 00:28:46,017
If it wasn't neurological
before, it sure is now.

627
00:28:46,084 --> 00:28:48,186
Right upper quadrant's
distended.

628
00:28:48,253 --> 00:28:50,938
He's hallucinating because
his liver's failing.

629
00:28:58,041 --> 00:29:00,442
Elevated transaminases
confirm liver failure.

630
00:29:00,579 --> 00:29:01,412
We'll have to put him
on the transplant list

631
00:29:01,463 --> 00:29:02,914
in a couple days.

632
00:29:02,982 --> 00:29:05,049
It's clearly not the silicone.
Could be vasculitis.

633
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:06,467
Serologies were negative.

634
00:29:08,270 --> 00:29:10,755
Yeah,
if you want Adams to hear,

635
00:29:10,806 --> 00:29:13,924
you might want to not stand
so conspicuously far away.

636
00:29:13,976 --> 00:29:15,193
<i>I'm making coffee.</i>

637
00:29:15,260 --> 00:29:17,812
And sometimes,
I date co-workers.

638
00:29:17,896 --> 00:29:19,263
Like everyone else
on the planet.

639
00:29:19,315 --> 00:29:20,365
Hepatic fibrosis.

640
00:29:20,432 --> 00:29:21,616
If it damaged his platelets,

641
00:29:21,700 --> 00:29:22,617
it'd explain the bleeding.

642
00:29:22,701 --> 00:29:23,985
<i>Unexpected.</i>

643
00:29:24,069 --> 00:29:25,286
I actually thought
you might agree with my theory.

644
00:29:25,371 --> 00:29:27,438
Because that would mean
nothing's your fault.

645
00:29:27,489 --> 00:29:29,907
You fell into relationships
based on proximity.

646
00:29:29,959 --> 00:29:31,125
Of course they failed.

647
00:29:31,210 --> 00:29:32,710
<i>But I guess I was wrong.</i>

648
00:29:32,778 --> 00:29:36,280
You picked perfect women.
You just screwed it up.

649
00:29:36,332 --> 00:29:38,833
How about all five of us
live together

650
00:29:38,917 --> 00:29:40,668
and the $7,000 sex doll?

651
00:29:40,753 --> 00:29:41,819
<i>It'll solve all our hang-ups.</i>

652
00:29:41,887 --> 00:29:43,121
$7,000?

653
00:29:43,188 --> 00:29:45,556
Adams suggests
that we all sleep together,

654
00:29:45,624 --> 00:29:47,792
and your issue is high prices?

655
00:29:47,860 --> 00:29:49,177
Pretty sure she was joking.

656
00:29:49,261 --> 00:29:50,979
Yes, I'm 99% sure
that you're right,

657
00:29:51,063 --> 00:29:52,430
but I would never
forgive myself--

658
00:29:52,481 --> 00:29:53,681
<i>Those dolls are only $5,000.</i>

659
00:29:53,766 --> 00:29:56,434
He must have had it customized
somehow.

660
00:29:59,938 --> 00:30:02,306
Oh, like, you didn't check
the website?

661
00:30:02,374 --> 00:30:04,809
I guess we don't need to ask
how your dating life is going.

662
00:30:04,860 --> 00:30:06,227
I was curious.

663
00:30:06,295 --> 00:30:08,329
Hepatic fibrosis wouldn't cause
difficulty breathing.

664
00:30:08,414 --> 00:30:11,482
It would if liver failure
opened pulmonary av shunts.

665
00:30:11,533 --> 00:30:12,583
Fibrosis fits.

666
00:30:12,651 --> 00:30:14,151
Start the patient on steroids

667
00:30:14,203 --> 00:30:16,788
and find out how
he pimped his ride.

668
00:30:16,839 --> 00:30:18,539
Why?

669
00:30:18,624 --> 00:30:20,925
Because
I don't know the answer.

670
00:30:32,438 --> 00:30:33,855
Hey.

671
00:30:33,939 --> 00:30:35,005
Foosball?

672
00:30:35,057 --> 00:30:37,141
Can't.
Marriage to destroy.

673
00:30:37,192 --> 00:30:40,010
Okay...

674
00:30:40,062 --> 00:30:44,014
"Okay" as in passive-aggressive
reverse psychology?

675
00:30:44,066 --> 00:30:46,617
Or as in depressed resignation

676
00:30:46,685 --> 00:30:50,388
"okay" as in
I changed my mind.

677
00:30:50,456 --> 00:30:52,123
Expand.

678
00:30:52,190 --> 00:30:55,710
Oh, it's morally reprehensible
and bound to fail,

679
00:30:55,794 --> 00:30:57,295
but in a weird way,
it's a step forward.

680
00:30:57,362 --> 00:30:58,463
This thing with Emily.

681
00:30:58,530 --> 00:30:59,497
Contract.

682
00:30:59,548 --> 00:31:01,198
It's real without being real.

683
00:31:01,250 --> 00:31:03,668
It's a long-term relationship
that can't actually hurt you.

684
00:31:03,719 --> 00:31:06,087
It's, um...a stepping stone.

685
00:31:06,171 --> 00:31:07,138
It means you want more.

686
00:31:09,808 --> 00:31:12,427
So, passive-aggressive
reverse psychology.

687
00:31:12,511 --> 00:31:14,028
Got it.

688
00:31:20,436 --> 00:31:22,770
<i>Try not to come on</i>
<i>too strong, okay?</i>

689
00:31:22,855 --> 00:31:24,856
Just get to know him a little.
Ease into it.

690
00:31:24,907 --> 00:31:26,724
Why would I ease?

691
00:31:26,775 --> 00:31:28,225
True.

692
00:31:28,277 --> 00:31:30,611
You could just walk up and
stick your hand down his pants,

693
00:31:30,696 --> 00:31:32,196
but I heard
there's a middle step.

694
00:31:32,247 --> 00:31:34,398
Men want to have sex.

695
00:31:34,450 --> 00:31:36,451
Not with crazy people.

696
00:31:36,535 --> 00:31:38,503
Well, yes,
a lot with crazy people,

697
00:31:38,570 --> 00:31:40,237
but not that kind of crazy.

698
00:31:40,289 --> 00:31:41,956
Well, yeah,
that kind of crazy--

699
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:44,459
They don't care how crazy
if she look like me.

700
00:31:44,543 --> 00:31:47,762
Okay.
Easing.

701
00:31:53,051 --> 00:31:55,686
Hi.
Hey.

702
00:31:55,754 --> 00:31:58,639
I'm Jennifer,
new to marketing department.

703
00:31:58,724 --> 00:32:00,641
Harris.
Accounts receivable.

704
00:32:00,726 --> 00:32:02,143
Oh, interesting.

705
00:32:02,227 --> 00:32:04,645
Do you want to get
out of here and have sex?

706
00:32:04,730 --> 00:32:06,697
Uh, sure.

707
00:32:08,934 --> 00:32:11,619
You know, I got 45 minutes
left on my lunch break.

708
00:32:11,703 --> 00:32:13,938
Mm-hmm.
Where you wanna go?

709
00:32:13,989 --> 00:32:19,127
Off to a place where men don't
cheat on the women they love.

710
00:32:19,211 --> 00:32:20,778
You're not invited,
obviously.

711
00:32:20,829 --> 00:32:23,548
Cheating?
What are you talking about?

712
00:32:23,615 --> 00:32:25,899
Why, I hope you're speaking

713
00:32:25,901 --> 00:32:28,753
out of some deep kind
of moral relativism because--

714
00:32:28,804 --> 00:32:30,888
Who are you people?

715
00:32:32,307 --> 00:32:33,758
You're not Emily's fiance.

716
00:32:33,809 --> 00:32:38,596
Emily's my sister.

717
00:32:41,934 --> 00:32:46,154
We called the company
that made Amy.

718
00:32:46,221 --> 00:32:50,808
They said they modeled her after
some photos you sent them.

719
00:32:55,164 --> 00:32:57,498
Who is she?

720
00:32:59,535 --> 00:33:01,669
We met last Christmas.

721
00:33:01,753 --> 00:33:05,322
She's a yoga instructor.

722
00:33:05,374 --> 00:33:06,824
Totally different from me.

723
00:33:06,875 --> 00:33:10,862
She--she loved Chopin,
hated Indian food.

724
00:33:13,515 --> 00:33:18,636
She changed entire my life
for 17 weeks.

725
00:33:24,193 --> 00:33:28,246
My husband cheated on me...

726
00:33:30,449 --> 00:33:36,220
With a girl he met on the plane
coming back from our honeymoon.

727
00:33:38,457 --> 00:33:41,826
It's not easy to get past things
like that.

728
00:33:45,681 --> 00:33:49,400
She wasn't unfaithful.
She didn't betray me.

729
00:33:49,468 --> 00:33:54,572
She just...she just wasn't
in love with me.

730
00:34:01,212 --> 00:34:04,682
I know Amy's not going
to break your heart.

731
00:34:04,750 --> 00:34:07,485
But she's also not going
to change your life.

732
00:34:14,559 --> 00:34:17,328
The lights are bright.

733
00:34:19,448 --> 00:34:22,533
Sorry.
What's happening to me?

734
00:34:22,584 --> 00:34:24,201
Is your neck stiff?

735
00:34:24,253 --> 00:34:25,870
Yeah.

736
00:34:25,921 --> 00:34:29,590
I think you have meningitis.

737
00:34:29,675 --> 00:34:31,408
<i>I'm not leaving</i>
<i>the business.</i>

738
00:34:31,460 --> 00:34:36,647
I'm just leaving you.

739
00:34:36,715 --> 00:34:37,748
I didn't want you
to feel bad.

740
00:34:37,799 --> 00:34:38,883
So let me get this straight.

741
00:34:38,934 --> 00:34:42,119
I'm being dumped
by a hooker...

742
00:34:42,187 --> 00:34:43,554
Who's worried about
my feelings?

743
00:34:43,622 --> 00:34:44,622
You're married.

744
00:34:44,690 --> 00:34:46,440
Half your clients
are married.

745
00:34:46,525 --> 00:34:47,942
And you're a hooker.

746
00:34:48,026 --> 00:34:50,761
My other guys sneak around,

747
00:34:50,812 --> 00:34:52,396
but you'll take me
into the bedroom

748
00:34:52,447 --> 00:34:53,698
while your wife's
in the next room.

749
00:34:53,765 --> 00:34:55,683
That's just...mean.

750
00:34:55,751 --> 00:34:57,434
Oh, my God.

751
00:34:57,486 --> 00:35:00,171
The marriage, it's a sham.

752
00:35:00,238 --> 00:35:03,374
The only really thing
about it is the green card

753
00:35:03,441 --> 00:35:05,826
she's going to get
at the end of it.

754
00:35:05,911 --> 00:35:08,112
So, if you want
to get the meter running...

755
00:35:08,163 --> 00:35:10,131
It's still mean.

756
00:35:10,215 --> 00:35:14,051
It's not a marriage.
It's a felony.

757
00:35:16,088 --> 00:35:18,022
I've seen how she looks at you
when you're together.

758
00:35:18,090 --> 00:35:19,523
<i>Trust me.</i>

759
00:35:19,591 --> 00:35:20,891
She likes you.

760
00:35:20,959 --> 00:35:25,146
And I've seen
how you look at her.

761
00:35:33,763 --> 00:35:36,848
Fever's up 105.
He's not responding to meds.

762
00:35:36,899 --> 00:35:38,850
At this rate,
he'll be dead

763
00:35:38,901 --> 00:35:40,235
by the time we get
the cultures back.

764
00:35:40,319 --> 00:35:42,153
Spinal fluid was full
of white cells.

765
00:35:42,221 --> 00:35:43,738
Meningitis could be
carcinomatous.

766
00:35:43,823 --> 00:35:45,323
Cytology showed nothing.

767
00:35:45,391 --> 00:35:48,410
An amoebic infection would cause
fever and meningitis.

768
00:35:48,494 --> 00:35:49,411
But not liver failure.

769
00:35:49,495 --> 00:35:51,363
It could if he had a clot.

770
00:35:51,414 --> 00:35:54,015
<i>How could amoebas get past</i>
<i>his cribriform plate?</i>

771
00:35:54,083 --> 00:35:57,619
He went swimming in
a frozen lake in New Jersey?

772
00:35:59,872 --> 00:36:02,540
Adams said his ex-girlfriend
was a yoga instructor.

773
00:36:02,591 --> 00:36:03,959
Maybe he sprained his chakras.

774
00:36:04,043 --> 00:36:05,293
Yoga nuts are
way more likely

775
00:36:05,378 --> 00:36:06,744
to be into
alternative medicine.

776
00:36:06,796 --> 00:36:10,598
He has this little weird teapot
in his house.

777
00:36:10,683 --> 00:36:12,417
What was it like?

778
00:36:12,468 --> 00:36:17,522
Um, little.
Weird. Teapot-ish.

779
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:25,764
Like that?

780
00:36:25,831 --> 00:36:27,399
Yeah.

781
00:36:27,466 --> 00:36:29,567
You think he drinks some
sort of toxic herbal tea?

782
00:36:29,635 --> 00:36:30,669
<i>Yes...</i>

783
00:36:30,736 --> 00:36:33,938
If by "tea,"
you mean salted tap water.

784
00:36:33,990 --> 00:36:36,607
And by "drink,"
you mean poured up his nose.

785
00:36:36,659 --> 00:36:39,210
His girlfriend didn't just leave
him with a broken heart.

786
00:36:39,278 --> 00:36:41,246
She left him with a neti pot.

787
00:36:41,313 --> 00:36:42,464
It's an Indian method of.

788
00:36:42,548 --> 00:36:46,117
Of clearing the sinuses
during allergy season.

789
00:36:46,168 --> 00:36:47,752
Also known as now.

790
00:36:47,803 --> 00:36:51,723
The distilled water can act
as a snot flushing system.

791
00:36:51,790 --> 00:36:55,443
With tap water, it can act
as an amoeba delivery system

792
00:36:55,511 --> 00:36:57,128
to the fluids around the brain.

793
00:36:57,196 --> 00:36:58,930
<i>Start him on metronidazole.</i>

794
00:36:58,981 --> 00:37:01,032
If he's lucky,
he'll get to see

795
00:37:01,100 --> 00:37:04,069
his plastic children
walk down the aisle.

796
00:37:08,974 --> 00:37:11,076
My neck
feels much better.

797
00:37:11,143 --> 00:37:12,410
Your fever's gone,

798
00:37:12,478 --> 00:37:14,696
and your liver function's
almost back to normal.

799
00:37:14,780 --> 00:37:16,414
You should be able
to go home soon.

800
00:37:16,482 --> 00:37:19,117
I'm going to have some hospital
bills to pay.

801
00:37:19,168 --> 00:37:23,654
I don't suppose used sex dolls
go for anything online.

802
00:37:25,791 --> 00:37:28,543
Dr. Adams?

803
00:37:28,627 --> 00:37:31,496
Can I get your email?

804
00:37:31,547 --> 00:37:33,431
What for?

805
00:37:35,217 --> 00:37:38,386
I just thought maybe
we could see each other again.

806
00:37:41,340 --> 00:37:42,390
I-I can't.

807
00:37:42,475 --> 00:37:43,742
<i>No, I know.</i>

808
00:37:43,809 --> 00:37:45,193
It's a professionalism thing,

809
00:37:45,277 --> 00:37:47,479
but you won't be my doctor
when I get out of here.

810
00:37:47,530 --> 00:37:49,514
It's not that.
It's--

811
00:37:49,565 --> 00:37:50,648
<i>what is it?</i>

812
00:37:50,699 --> 00:37:52,850
You said I should
change my life.

813
00:37:52,902 --> 00:37:54,569
You were talking
about yourself, too.

814
00:37:54,653 --> 00:37:56,621
I know you were.
Henry, I--

815
00:37:56,688 --> 00:37:59,157
I think you should
ask Molly out.

816
00:38:04,213 --> 00:38:06,214
I should have known
this would happen.

817
00:38:06,298 --> 00:38:08,967
You're a good guy, Henry.

818
00:38:09,034 --> 00:38:14,038
You deserve more than a doll.

819
00:38:15,391 --> 00:38:20,044
Promise me
you'll keep trying.

820
00:38:20,096 --> 00:38:22,564
Okay.

821
00:38:30,489 --> 00:38:32,991
Date tonight?

822
00:38:36,662 --> 00:38:38,229
So she can't deal.

823
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:40,031
There's someone
out there who can.

824
00:38:40,082 --> 00:38:41,783
You just got to find her.

825
00:38:41,867 --> 00:38:43,585
I'd love to prove
House wrong,

826
00:38:43,669 --> 00:38:47,205
but...I ruined my marriage,

827
00:38:47,256 --> 00:38:48,673
broke two people's hearts,

828
00:38:48,740 --> 00:38:50,258
had two kids who are always

829
00:38:50,342 --> 00:38:52,927
going to wonder why I didn't
love their mommy enough.

830
00:38:53,012 --> 00:38:58,299
It's better if I just...
focus on what I do have.

831
00:39:01,470 --> 00:39:03,938
Give that band guy a call.

832
00:39:04,023 --> 00:39:06,524
I'm not that good at guitar.

833
00:39:06,592 --> 00:39:10,562
Or flirting or small talk.

834
00:39:10,613 --> 00:39:13,698
I'm not as pretty as Adams,

835
00:39:13,765 --> 00:39:17,101
I have stuffy clothes,
and I hate my hair.

836
00:39:17,153 --> 00:39:20,321
Adams works 80 hours a week
fixing bunions on hobos

837
00:39:20,406 --> 00:39:23,708
because she can't face getting
to know someone new.

838
00:39:23,775 --> 00:39:24,976
Trust me.

839
00:39:25,044 --> 00:39:30,448
You find a boyfriend,
she'll be the jealous one.

840
00:39:34,086 --> 00:39:36,504
See you tomorrow.

841
00:39:38,557 --> 00:39:41,392
Do you...

842
00:39:42,961 --> 00:39:45,296
want to get a drink?

843
00:39:45,347 --> 00:39:48,066
To annoy Park
or to prove House wrong?

844
00:39:48,133 --> 00:39:52,136
Oh, I...
It's just, um...

845
00:39:52,188 --> 00:39:54,772
I think it's time
for a change.

846
00:39:57,443 --> 00:40:02,380
I don't really think that's
a good idea for me right now.

847
00:40:04,816 --> 00:40:09,120
House has a way
of getting in people's heads.

848
00:40:09,171 --> 00:40:12,290
Yeah.
Yeah.

849
00:40:23,335 --> 00:40:25,353
No, mom.
I'm still at work.

850
00:40:26,772 --> 00:40:28,839
I'll be home in a couple hours.

851
00:40:28,891 --> 00:40:30,775
Love you too.

852
00:40:40,035 --> 00:40:41,852
Ready?

853
00:40:41,904 --> 00:40:45,323
One, two, three, four.

[Playing <i>I Got You Babe]</i>

855
00:40:48,410 --> 00:40:51,796

856
00:40:51,863 --> 00:40:54,749

and we don't know ?

857
00:40:54,833 --> 00:41:00,672

won't pay the rent ?

? before it's earned,
our money's all been spent ?

865
00:41:27,416 --> 00:41:30,635

we don't have a pot ?

866

you're a clown ?

873
00:42:03,152 --> 00:42:06,537
I fix blender.

874
00:42:06,605 --> 00:42:08,573
So I see.

875
00:42:08,624 --> 00:42:12,327
I had fun seducing
hooker's fake fiance.

876
00:42:12,411 --> 00:42:14,412
Sorry it didn't work.

877
00:42:14,463 --> 00:42:17,465
Yeah,
I thought I'd take a break

878
00:42:17,549 --> 00:42:19,751
from the whole hooker thing.

879
00:42:21,136 --> 00:42:24,138
I think maybe you need
milk shake.

880
00:42:24,223 --> 00:42:26,791
