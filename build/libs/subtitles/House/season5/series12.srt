Yes.

and why are you telling me?

00:05:01,034 --> 00:05:04,401
I was expecting something
involving whipped cream
and tongue depressors.

52
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:08,133

specialists over three years,
no diagnosis and no relief.

53
00:05:08,207 --> 00:05:11,540

already. It's like
I'm treating myself.

54
00:05:11,611 --> 00:05:13,704

and I get to learn
a valuable lesson

about the milk of
human kindness.

Sounds like you
don't work for House.

63
00:05:30,963 --> 00:05:33,158
A diagnosis that provides
neither an explanation
nor a cure

64
00:05:33,232 --> 00:05:34,859
is, by definition,
not a diagnosis.

65
00:05:34,934 --> 00:05:37,334
The American College
of Rheumatology
would disagree.

66
00:05:37,403 --> 00:05:38,995
There're specific
diagnostic criteria...

67
00:05:39,072 --> 00:05:40,164
Which this guy
doesn't meet.

68
00:05:40,239 --> 00:05:42,673
Putting pressure
on his pain helps,
doesn't make it worse.

69
00:05:42,742 --> 00:05:46,234
He's got abdominal pain,
severe headaches, muscle
cramps that come and go.

70
00:05:46,312 --> 00:05:47,540
And he tried
to off himself.

71
00:05:47,613 --> 00:05:49,945
He's, obviously, mentally
ill. The pain's probably
psychological.

72
00:05:50,016 --> 00:05:52,541
It's not a sign
of mental illness to
wanna be pain-free.

73
00:05:52,618 --> 00:05:56,884
It is if your solution is
sucking on a tailpipe. Sane
people don't attempt suicide.

74

76
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:04,793
I'd shoot the guys
with the torches.

77
00:06:05,765 --> 00:06:07,756
Not one doctor
this guy's seen in
the past three years

78
00:06:07,834 --> 00:06:09,734
has been able to
find a single thing
wrong with him.

79
00:06:09,802 --> 00:06:10,791
What does that tell you?

80
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:12,360
It means they're idiots.

81
00:06:12,438 --> 00:06:14,303
It means we got to
start from the beginning.

82
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:17,366
And do a pain profile to
rule out psychosomatic pain.

83
00:06:17,443 --> 00:06:23,177
Search the home. Go home.
Get a refill. And a donut.

84

It's up and down.

92
00:06:59,318 --> 00:07:02,754

the meds, his sleep
pattern's pretty erratic.

He's more nervous

"He's so nervous
he's miserable."

95
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:09,327
He's definitely calm.

96
00:07:09,395 --> 00:07:12,330
Sometimes calmer
the worse the pain gets.

97
00:07:13,566 --> 00:07:17,627
I think talking,
interacting with other people,
actually makes it worse.

98
00:07:17,703 --> 00:07:18,795
Interesting.

99
00:07:18,871 --> 00:07:20,532
Why, does that
mean something?

100
00:07:20,606 --> 00:07:22,597
No, it's just...

101
00:07:22,675 --> 00:07:26,441

in other patients.

but a pharmacy's worth of

like a Christian Scientist.

113

He's also more
compliant than House.
Kept all the inserts.

114
00:08:18,464 --> 00:08:22,059

to make sure
he didn't mix them up.

115

go out in a car, this
ain't a bad one to choose.

116
00:08:25,938 --> 00:08:28,771
If I ever did it,
it definitely wouldn't
be like that.

117

Don't worry,
I'm not making any plans.

118
00:08:31,611 --> 00:08:32,908
I certainly wouldn't know.

119
00:08:32,979 --> 00:08:35,072
Ever since we kissed,
you've been avoiding me.

120
00:08:35,147 --> 00:08:38,446
No, I haven't.
I've just been busy.

121
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:41,282
Metal polish could
cause nerve damage,
if he inhaled enough of it.

122
00:08:41,354 --> 00:08:43,845
And judging by
the shine on that car,
he used a fair amount.

123
00:08:43,923 --> 00:08:47,518
And judging by the fact
that he owns a body shop,
and one of these,

124
00:08:47,593 --> 00:08:49,424
I'd say he knew
not to inhale.

125
00:08:50,863 --> 00:08:52,854
Busy tonight?
We could get some dinner.

126
00:08:54,467 --> 00:08:55,729
I don't think so.

127
00:08:55,801 --> 00:08:58,964
So, making out, okay,
meals, too intimate?

128
00:08:59,038 --> 00:09:01,404
I don't wanna kiss
you again, either.

129
00:09:01,474 --> 00:09:02,907
Why? Because
we work together?

130
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:06,069
No. Because I like you.

131
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:08,938
That makes a lot of sense.

132
00:09:09,015 --> 00:09:12,109
What doesn't make sense
is me getting involved
with anyone.

133
00:09:12,184 --> 00:09:15,745
I thought you'd gotten
past that. That's why you
agreed to the drug trial.

134
00:09:15,821 --> 00:09:17,083
You can't give up
on life because...

135
00:09:17,156 --> 00:09:20,887
I'm not giving up on life,
I'm just giving up on you.

136

I finally feel like
I have a grip on things,
I can handle this.

137
00:09:25,364 --> 00:09:29,130
What I can't handle
is dragging anyone
else down with me.

138
00:09:33,706 --> 00:09:35,537

quail to you?

TAUB: You think he's had
food poisoning every day
for the last three years?

140
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:43,674
THIRTEEN:
Wild quail can be toxic,
cause rhabdomyolysis,

141
00:09:43,749 --> 00:09:46,411
which would explain
his pain as well as
the elevated CK levels.

142
00:09:46,485 --> 00:09:48,817
So would the carbon monoxide
he sucked out of his car.

143
00:09:48,888 --> 00:09:52,324
It's not a toxic reaction,
it's a psychosomatic reaction.

144
00:09:52,391 --> 00:09:55,849
The pain profile showed
an excessive concern about
his physical health,

145
00:09:55,928 --> 00:09:57,555
difficulty sleeping,
getting out of bed...

146
00:09:57,630 --> 00:09:59,359
He's not in pain
because he's depressed,

147
00:09:59,432 --> 00:10:01,059
he's depressed
because he's in pain.

148
00:10:01,133 --> 00:10:04,466
Not according to the
pain profile you ordered.
It's not a diet issue.

149
00:10:04,537 --> 00:10:07,665
We should start him on
antidepressants, for his
sake as well as his family's.

150
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:09,105
We're not diagnosing
his family.

151
00:10:09,175 --> 00:10:11,302
We're not diagnosing
you, either.

152
00:10:13,813 --> 00:10:14,905
It's rhabdo.

153
00:10:14,981 --> 00:10:17,677
Push IV fluids,
check his urine,
do a muscle biopsy.

154
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:20,378
What muscle?
He says it hurts
all over.

155
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:22,353
Then she'll
biopsy all over.

156
00:10:24,523 --> 00:10:25,547
Where are you going?

157
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:27,684
If Cuddy can come in late,
I can leave early.

158
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:30,820
If you need anything
while I'm gone, just
ask Cameron to do it.

159
00:10:33,899 --> 00:10:36,697
So if he just
stops eating quail,
the pain will go away?

160
00:10:36,769 --> 00:10:38,600
If we're right,
it's definitely treatable.

V-Q scan showed
a pulmonary embolism.

172
00:11:26,852 --> 00:11:28,615
Means the pain's
not psychosomatic.

Also means it's
not rhabdomyolysis.

174

Up till now his heart
and lungs were the only
places he didn't have pain.

be consistent with rhabdo,

means my whole

No. But categorically
insisting there are
no circumstances

199
00:13:39,718 --> 00:13:42,653
means you've got baggage,
personal betrayal,
abandonment...

200
00:13:42,721 --> 00:13:45,315
Just because you grew up
in a Charles Dickens novel...

once this week. I wouldn't
want to look elitist.

I write up an estimate.

and into your shower.

it was pulled apart.

out a few naked pull-ups

give somebody else a call.

your hand to check for

no intimacy from it.

nothing to do with you.

234
00:15:37,002 --> 00:15:39,266
I know.
That's the problem.

235
00:15:39,338 --> 00:15:42,603
There's 80 reasons we
shouldn't date. But you
can't shut everyone out.

236
00:15:42,675 --> 00:15:44,609
You're gonna
need help, support.

237
00:15:44,677 --> 00:15:47,703
Look at our patient.
Thirty-two years old,
not dead yet,

238
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:50,544
and already
he's traumatized
his wife, his son...

239
00:15:50,616 --> 00:15:53,483
And I'll bet they're
cherishing every traumatic
minute he has left,

240
00:15:53,552 --> 00:15:55,281
wouldn't trade him
for the healthiest
guy in the world.

241
00:15:55,354 --> 00:15:59,791
True. And they're
stuck suffering with him,
hating every day,

242
00:15:59,858 --> 00:16:02,986
only their pain has
no prospect of relief.

243
00:16:03,062 --> 00:16:04,154
This a bad time?

244
00:16:04,229 --> 00:16:05,253
No.
Yes.

245
00:16:06,532 --> 00:16:07,726
No trace of cancer
in the patient.

246
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,597
But we did find edema
in his intestines,

247
00:16:09,668 --> 00:16:12,296
air in the intestinal
blood vessels, and House
won't answer his phone.

248
00:16:12,371 --> 00:16:15,067
His intestine must be
damaged, the air's
leaking into his body.

249
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:17,438
If there's a blockage
in the superior
mesenteric artery,

250
00:16:17,509 --> 00:16:19,170
it could be
choking off blood flow
to his intestine.

251
00:16:19,244 --> 00:16:21,439
Blockages all over his body
would explain his pain,

252
00:16:21,513 --> 00:16:23,105
why the cramps come and go.

253
00:16:23,182 --> 00:16:25,309
Do an angioplasty
on the superior
mesenteric,

254
00:16:25,384 --> 00:16:28,182
and find the other
blockages, before he has
another cardiac arrest.

255
00:16:28,253 --> 00:16:29,550
I'll help.

256
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:45,698
Good thing we don't
have a suicidal patient

257
00:16:45,771 --> 00:16:48,035
with a horrific,
undiagnosed pain disorder.

258
00:16:48,107 --> 00:16:50,007
We did,
till we diagnosed it.

259
00:16:50,075 --> 00:16:53,772
We found intestinal edema
and air in the blood vessels.
The pain was vascular.

260
00:16:53,846 --> 00:16:56,280
If it was vascular,
we would've seen
uneven pulses.

261
00:16:56,348 --> 00:16:59,181
His blood pressure was uneven.
Thirteen and Kutner
are doing an angio.

262
00:16:59,251 --> 00:17:01,048
He'd have hemorrhages
in his fingers.

263
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:04,055
There's air in the intestine,
it has to have come
from somewhere.

264
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:10,393
Yes, it does.

265
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:15,523
After we thread the
catheter through his
groin and into position,

266
00:17:15,601 --> 00:17:17,159
the blood will start
flowing freely again.

267
00:17:17,236 --> 00:17:19,136
Will that take
away the pain?

268
00:17:19,204 --> 00:17:23,766
It will be completely
ineffective, and the pain
will completely go away.

269
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:25,867
Cancel the angio.
He has air in
his blood vessels.

270
00:17:25,944 --> 00:17:27,411
If we don't open
the artery to his intestine...

271
00:17:27,479 --> 00:17:29,208
Where can air come from?

272
00:17:30,215 --> 00:17:31,204
Hmm.

273
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:35,042
Air can either come from
a breach of the lumen
in the small intestine,

274
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:39,682
or, in rare instances,
air can come from the air.

275
00:17:41,226 --> 00:17:42,523
Teeth marks.

276
00:17:43,262 --> 00:17:45,321
I'm guessing from
when he blew
into his IV tube.

277
00:17:45,397 --> 00:17:47,888
Air bubble caused
the PE and cardiac arrest.

278
00:17:47,966 --> 00:17:51,595
You tried to finish the job
that you started at home.

279
00:17:51,670 --> 00:17:55,231

You said that...

280
00:17:55,307 --> 00:17:56,797
I lied.

281
00:17:59,912 --> 00:18:01,470

282
00:18:06,151 --> 00:18:07,812
Please just let me die.

287

You know, because
the whole idea of
suicide watch

288
00:18:31,577 --> 00:18:35,104

for suicidal patients.

have thought the name was
just a coincidence...

learning our lesson?
Because the telephone...

He insisted
he was no longer...

299
00:18:57,636 --> 00:18:59,194
Apparently,
he lied.

300
00:18:59,271 --> 00:19:02,331
Didn't think I'd have to
remind you of that
remote possibility.

Sorry, I was thinking
about the patient.
What were you saying?

304
00:19:13,352 --> 00:19:15,081
Go on.
The pain started
in his abdomen,

305
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:17,520
near his intestine.
The first symptom's
got to be key.

and squeakier than
Cuddy's rubber nipples.

308
00:19:23,028 --> 00:19:25,826
What about a glycogen-storage
disease, like McArdle's.

309
00:19:25,898 --> 00:19:29,857
Explains the pain, plus
there's plenty of muscle cells
in the wall of the intestine.

Hopping pain.
Means it's something
in his brain, not his body.

Except the pain's in two
places that connect two
separate regions of the brain,

not using yours.

it's gotta be central...

00:22:42,361 --> 00:22:44,727
Could still be peripheral.

00:30:09,407 --> 00:30:10,431
Because we ran
out of ideas.

489
00:30:10,508 --> 00:30:11,907
Nothing explains this.

490
00:30:11,976 --> 00:30:13,409
Something has to.

491
00:30:17,515 --> 00:30:21,451
Unless nothing does.

492
00:30:21,519 --> 00:30:22,781
So now you think it's...

493
00:30:22,854 --> 00:30:25,220
Mine's a more interesting
version of nothing.

494
00:30:25,290 --> 00:30:27,850
It used to be something.
We can't find anything

495
00:30:27,926 --> 00:30:32,795
because whatever injury
caused the original pain
healed a long time ago.

496
00:30:32,864 --> 00:30:36,197
The only thing left
is the drugs.

497
00:30:37,769 --> 00:30:39,031
Opioid-induced pain.

498
00:30:39,103 --> 00:30:42,595
Pain and the drugs
that treat pain work by
changing brain chemistry.

499
00:30:42,674 --> 00:30:47,441
Sometimes to the point
where pain receptors read
painkillers as killer pain.

500
00:30:48,446 --> 00:30:50,607
Take him off the drugs.

501
00:30:50,682 --> 00:30:52,445
We can't cure him,
so we're gonna
torture him?

502
00:30:52,517 --> 00:30:56,146
Torture is the cure.
Eventually his body
will recalibrate itself.

503
00:30:56,221 --> 00:30:57,313
Assuming you're right.

504
00:30:57,388 --> 00:30:59,583
Yes, I find it confusing
to assume otherwise.

505
00:30:59,657 --> 00:31:02,888
How would you like
to stop taking Vicodin?

506
00:31:02,961 --> 00:31:04,622
Good thing I'm
not the patient.

510
00:31:18,009 --> 00:31:20,136
Thank you.
Is it too big?

511
00:31:20,211 --> 00:31:22,907
She'll grow into it.
Put it there.

512
00:31:24,716 --> 00:31:28,447
I take it
the home inspection
was pushed back?

513
00:31:28,519 --> 00:31:29,850
I passed.

514
00:31:32,590 --> 00:31:34,888
You do realize
that's a good thing?

515
00:31:34,959 --> 00:31:36,392
This place was a disaster.

516
00:31:36,461 --> 00:31:40,295
I had to stash a dirty
diaper in my briefcase.

517
00:31:40,365 --> 00:31:42,026
So you buy another briefcase.

518
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:44,864
I let House supervise
himself. That's like
handing a 12-year-old

519
00:31:44,936 --> 00:31:46,801
the keys to the liquor
cabinet and the car.

520
00:31:46,871 --> 00:31:48,463
You passed the inspection.

521
00:31:48,539 --> 00:31:51,133
The patient lived.
The car is still
in the driveway.

522
00:31:51,209 --> 00:31:55,339
And the next time my
nanny gets sick? When House
wants to saw someone in half?

523
00:31:55,413 --> 00:31:57,938
Did I mention you
passed the inspection?

524
00:31:59,918 --> 00:32:03,376
I passed by their
meager standard,
I failed by mine.

525
00:32:04,255 --> 00:32:06,246
Why do women
always do that?

526
00:32:07,825 --> 00:32:10,225
Fail?
Create ridiculous standards

527
00:32:10,295 --> 00:32:13,423
that no human could meet.
With your careers,
with your kids.

528
00:32:13,498 --> 00:32:14,726
You gotta be more
like us men.

529
00:32:14,799 --> 00:32:17,666
Be lazy? Blame others?

530
00:32:17,735 --> 00:32:22,399
Get help. Most men in your
position have a deputy and
two assistants at work,

531
00:32:22,473 --> 00:32:27,672
and a wife and two nannies
at home. You're not
Superwoman, don't be a martyr.

532
00:32:31,816 --> 00:32:33,750
We'll be injecting
you with naloxone,

533
00:32:33,818 --> 00:32:36,378
which will knock the opioids
out of your pain receptors.

534
00:32:36,454 --> 00:32:39,014
If we're right,
your system will recalibrate
within a few hours,

535
00:32:39,090 --> 00:32:40,648
and most of the pain
will be gone.
Hours?

536
00:32:40,725 --> 00:32:41,749
I need those drugs.

537
00:32:41,826 --> 00:32:43,020
Not if they're
causing your pain.

538
00:32:43,094 --> 00:32:44,925
Then knock me out,
sedate me while you...

539
00:32:44,996 --> 00:32:47,794
That takes drugs, too.
We need to clear everything
out of your system.

540
00:32:47,865 --> 00:32:49,389
Please, I'll try
anything else.

we're trying to stop.

542

So it's not your parents,
then it's your wife,
someone you were close...

543
00:32:59,644 --> 00:33:03,341
A colleague.
We were
residents together.

544
00:33:03,681 --> 00:33:08,084
I should've done more
to stop it. He had the
mother of all God complexes.

545
00:33:08,152 --> 00:33:11,986
So busy treating
everyone's problems,
he was blind to his own.

546
00:33:12,056 --> 00:33:16,356
Helped himself to
a vial of insulin.
It's a miracle he survived.

547
00:33:16,461 --> 00:33:20,898
His friends
and family almost didn't.
He was a selfish ass.

548
00:33:26,704 --> 00:33:28,103

(JEFF GROANING)

550
00:33:34,212 --> 00:33:37,704
This is lunacy.
You're torturing
this guy on a hunch.

551
00:33:38,516 --> 00:33:40,416
It's the only
hunch we've got.

552
00:33:41,152 --> 00:33:45,111
If I really wanted
to torture him, I'd
manipulate a clinical trial

553
00:33:45,189 --> 00:33:47,214
in the hopes that
he'd sleep with you.

554
00:33:47,992 --> 00:33:51,257
Are you suggesting I got
Thirteen in that trial
because of some personal...

555
00:33:51,329 --> 00:33:54,162
I think you got her in
because of your usual
messiah complex.

556
00:33:54,232 --> 00:33:56,097
I think you messed
with the appointment
schedule

557
00:33:56,167 --> 00:34:01,002
because of your
l-like-to-have-sex complex.
I checked the logs.

558
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:05,107
You moved your most
promising patient
right before her.

559
00:34:05,176 --> 00:34:08,373
False hope being
quite the aphrodisiac.

560
00:34:08,446 --> 00:34:11,006
How's it false
if the trials are
showing results?

561
00:34:11,082 --> 00:34:14,779
If it were that promising,
you wouldn't have to
change the schedule.

some of the portions
in that recipe were off.

I sure hope it happens
to be covered, under,
say, section three,

subsection 2.2,
paragraph one.
"Accidental fire damage."

570
00:34:44,649 --> 00:34:50,383
In which case you'd have to
replace the entire water line
to fix the sagging pipe.

00:34:50,455 --> 00:34:51,479

618
00:38:13,758 --> 00:38:18,457
Oh, so close.
The correct answer
is epilepsy.

619
00:38:18,929 --> 00:38:20,624
Epilepsy doesn't
cause chronic pain.

620
00:38:20,698 --> 00:38:23,030
It does if it spreads
to the sensory region
of the brain,

621
00:38:23,100 --> 00:38:24,590
then rewires
the pain neurons.

622
00:38:24,669 --> 00:38:26,364
Would've shown up
on an EEG.

623
00:38:26,437 --> 00:38:29,065
Not if the seizures
are in a place you
can't see on an EEG,

624
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:30,539

in the brain,

625
00:38:30,608 --> 00:38:34,237
like the area that
controls the muscles

all started. It wasn't the
stomach. It was lower, right?

00:38:57,768 --> 00:39:00,259
It started in the
stomach, cramps.

is treatable.

655
00:41:47,171 --> 00:41:48,195
What?

656
00:41:48,272 --> 00:41:51,673
The medication. When we
switch out the bags you
can smell it. It's disgusting.

657
00:41:51,742 --> 00:41:53,209
I didn't smell anything.

658
00:41:53,978 --> 00:41:55,809
She must be on
the placebo, then.

659
00:42:15,799 --> 00:42:19,166
You offered to do House's
budget because you
wanted him to owe you,

660
00:42:19,236 --> 00:42:21,898
wanted him to take
that case. Why?

661
00:42:21,972 --> 00:42:24,600
I thought it would help
House, seeing someone
worse off than him,

662
00:42:24,675 --> 00:42:27,439
possibly curing a guy
with even less to
look forward to.

663
00:42:31,549 --> 00:42:32,777
(CLEARS THROAT)

664
00:42:33,350 --> 00:42:35,011
Can I ask you something?

665
00:42:38,155 --> 00:42:39,884
How would you
like my job?
