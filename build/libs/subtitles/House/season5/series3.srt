1
00:00:24,157 --> 00:00:27,593
I still can't believe
you talked me into this.

2
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:30,128
(CHUCKLING) Come on,
honey, you're gonna
throw him off.

3
00:00:30,196 --> 00:00:32,528
It's okay,
I'm almost done.

4
00:00:33,666 --> 00:00:34,758
(SIGHS)

5
00:00:34,834 --> 00:00:37,234
A little more light
on your hips.

6
00:00:37,303 --> 00:00:38,327
God.

7
00:00:38,405 --> 00:00:40,930
Why couldn't you
have come up with this
before I had two kids?

8
00:00:41,007 --> 00:00:43,942
(CHUCKLING)
You look amazing.

9
00:00:45,845 --> 00:00:50,680
Okay, I think...
Yeah, I'm done. Want
to come take a look?

10
00:00:51,785 --> 00:00:52,979
(CHUCKLES)

11
00:00:57,424 --> 00:00:58,618
(SIGHS) I can't.

12
00:00:58,691 --> 00:00:59,953
(BOTH LAUGHING)

13
00:01:00,026 --> 00:01:01,254
You first.

14
00:01:01,327 --> 00:01:02,658
No, we'll look together.

15
00:01:10,637 --> 00:01:12,628
I don't understand.
I thought...

16
00:01:12,705 --> 00:01:13,899
What the hell is that?

17
00:01:13,973 --> 00:01:15,167
Honey, it's okay.

18
00:01:15,241 --> 00:01:17,266
This is not
what we discussed,
or what I paid for.

19
00:01:17,343 --> 00:01:19,971
I don't understand.
I think this is one of
the best I've ever done.

20
00:01:20,046 --> 00:01:21,070
I want my money back.

21
00:01:21,147 --> 00:01:23,741
I'm sorry, but this is
not some department
store photo studio.

22
00:01:23,817 --> 00:01:25,546
And this is
not my wife.

23
00:01:25,618 --> 00:01:26,778
Yes, it is.

24
00:01:26,853 --> 00:01:31,085
You asked me to paint
her exactly as she looks.
That's exactly what I did.

25
00:01:31,958 --> 00:01:33,926
Honey! Stop it!

26
00:01:33,993 --> 00:01:35,893
What's going on?
Brandon.

27
00:01:35,962 --> 00:01:40,558
That check better
be in my mailbox by
Friday, or I'll be back.

28
00:01:42,068 --> 00:01:43,365
Come on.

29
00:01:43,970 --> 00:01:44,959
What happened?

30
00:01:45,038 --> 00:01:46,164
I don't know.

31
00:01:46,239 --> 00:01:48,764
They saw the painting,
and they just freaked out.

32
00:01:52,745 --> 00:01:54,076
Brandon, what is this?

33
00:01:54,147 --> 00:01:55,739
What do you mean?
It's her portrait.

34
00:01:57,650 --> 00:01:58,878
What's wrong with it?

35
00:02:40,226 --> 00:02:41,659
Why is this in here?

36
00:02:41,728 --> 00:02:43,355
First column,
last entry.

37
00:02:45,398 --> 00:02:47,559
Today is going
to be a good day.

38
00:02:52,505 --> 00:02:53,529
This him?

39
00:02:53,606 --> 00:02:54,971
No.
Yes.

40
00:02:56,009 --> 00:02:58,204
She means, are you the
private investigator

41
00:02:58,278 --> 00:03:00,872
whose bills I've
tried to slip through
as medical expenses?

42
00:03:00,947 --> 00:03:03,780
Oh. Hi.
I'm Lucas Douglas, PI.

43
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:06,683
This hospital is
not putting a private
investigator on retainer,

44
00:03:06,753 --> 00:03:08,152
nor is it going
to pay any more

45
00:03:08,221 --> 00:03:10,189
phony repairs on
vending machines,

46
00:03:10,256 --> 00:03:11,780
cryostats, or elevators.

47
00:03:11,858 --> 00:03:14,520
Information saves lives.
Saving lives saves money.

48
00:03:14,594 --> 00:03:17,062
No, saving lives
costs money,

49
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:20,224
which is why I'm
trying to make sure
there's still some left.

50
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:21,892
You want your
own personal PI,

51
00:03:21,968 --> 00:03:24,562
you're gonna have to
pay for him yourself.

52
00:03:24,637 --> 00:03:26,400
Sorry.
No, I understand.

53
00:03:26,839 --> 00:03:28,739
Hey, I like the
shoes, by the way.

54
00:03:29,242 --> 00:03:30,334
Oh.

55
00:03:32,078 --> 00:03:33,443
Thank you.

56
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:38,912
You don't
like her shoes,
you like her legs.

57
00:03:38,985 --> 00:03:40,976
It sounds less creepy
if you say shoes.

58
00:03:41,054 --> 00:03:43,045
Less creepy, more gay.

59
00:03:43,122 --> 00:03:44,646
That's my firm's motto.

60
00:03:45,625 --> 00:03:47,183
What is a cryostat?

61
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:51,720
No idea.
Whoever fixed ours is
about to get stiffed.

62
00:04:04,177 --> 00:04:07,374
There's no distorted
perspective in any of
his other recent works.

63
00:04:07,447 --> 00:04:09,312
Not much talent
either.

64
00:04:09,382 --> 00:04:11,179
It's like the symptom
just came on.

65
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:13,913
Acute onset visual agnosia
points to a stroke
or brain tumor.

66
00:04:13,987 --> 00:04:15,818
TAUB: MRI revealed no
stroke or brain tumor.

67
00:04:15,888 --> 00:04:17,321
We should do another
with contrast.

68
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:18,982
If he's like the other
struggling artists
I've known,

69
00:04:19,058 --> 00:04:20,082
he's also into drugs.

70
00:04:20,159 --> 00:04:22,593
We should...
What are you looking at?

71
00:04:22,662 --> 00:04:24,220
Apparently a moron.

72
00:04:24,297 --> 00:04:27,027
One, ER routinely
tests for drugs.

73
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:29,068
If it was positive,
we wouldn't be
looking at this file.

74
00:04:29,135 --> 00:04:33,265
Two, who pays 12%
interest on a car loan?

75
00:04:33,339 --> 00:04:35,739
How did you...
Did you run a
credit check on me?

76
00:04:35,808 --> 00:04:37,435
No, that would
be illegal.

77
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:40,604
Interestingly enough,
paying someone to run
it for me, though...

78
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:41,704
(SCOFFS)

79
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:45,908
What?
It's part of my job.

80
00:04:45,985 --> 00:04:47,509
Your job is to
diagnose patients.

81
00:04:47,587 --> 00:04:48,747
Which I do
with a team.

82
00:04:48,821 --> 00:04:51,517
How am I supposed
to know how best
to utilize that team

83
00:04:51,591 --> 00:04:53,923
if I don't know
everything about them?

84
00:04:53,993 --> 00:04:56,962
Say that
Van Gogh turns out
to have neurosyphilis,

85
00:04:57,030 --> 00:04:59,464
and our last
vial of penicillin
is in a storeroom

86
00:04:59,532 --> 00:05:02,933
at the end of
a 20-mile hallway with
a two-foot-high ceiling.

87
00:05:03,002 --> 00:05:05,232
You've discovered that
one of us has been
hiding the ability

88
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:07,239
to stretch or
shrink themselves?

89
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:10,799
No, I would never out
someone's superpowers.

90
00:05:12,045 --> 00:05:13,535
This, on the other hand...

91
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:18,307
You crawled 20 miles?

92
00:05:18,384 --> 00:05:19,715
My name's in
the <i>Guinness Book.</i>

93
00:05:19,786 --> 00:05:22,050
I'll bet that really
impresses the babes.

94
00:05:22,121 --> 00:05:23,816
I didn't do it
to get the babes.

95
00:05:23,890 --> 00:05:26,415
No, that would
cheapen the purity
of your achievement.

96
00:05:26,492 --> 00:05:29,427
Sorry to interrupt, but
we have a patient with
a probable brain tumor.

97
00:05:29,495 --> 00:05:32,157
Who needs
an MRI with contrast.
We've established that.

98
00:05:32,231 --> 00:05:33,823
What do you
got on Taub?

99
00:05:34,901 --> 00:05:36,198
I got nothing on Taub.

100
00:05:36,269 --> 00:05:37,293
THIRTEEN: Could also
be environmental.

101
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:39,634
We should check his
studio for toxins,
mold, fungus...

102
00:05:39,706 --> 00:05:40,934
Taub's wife,
on the other hand...

103
00:05:41,007 --> 00:05:42,065
FOREMAN: House.

104
00:05:42,675 --> 00:05:43,869
That's enough.

105
00:05:45,712 --> 00:05:48,272
Dad's right. This is
no time for gossip.

106
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:50,543
Patient desperately
needs our help.

107
00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:53,175
Check his head
and his house.

108
00:05:53,252 --> 00:05:55,152
Can't Lucas...
No.

109
00:05:55,221 --> 00:05:56,654
He's very busy.

110
00:05:58,825 --> 00:06:00,622
FOREMAN: If there is a tumor,
this test will show us...

111
00:06:00,693 --> 00:06:02,092
Is that stuff
dangerous?

112
00:06:02,161 --> 00:06:04,061
This is just the
contrast material.

113
00:06:04,764 --> 00:06:07,824
There is a small risk of
an anaphylactic reaction.

114
00:06:08,968 --> 00:06:10,265
I could stop breathing?

115
00:06:10,336 --> 00:06:12,736
Don't worry.
We're prepared to deal
with whatever happens.

116
00:06:12,805 --> 00:06:15,399
You know, I did some
drawings this morning
and they seem fine.

117
00:06:15,508 --> 00:06:17,305
So, maybe it
was just a reaction
to something I ate.

118
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:19,174
FOREMAN: How many people
you know have reactions
like that

119
00:06:19,245 --> 00:06:20,576
to something they
ate for breakfast?

120
00:06:20,646 --> 00:06:21,738
But if I'm
getting better...

121
00:06:21,814 --> 00:06:23,008
You'll continue
to get better.

122
00:06:23,082 --> 00:06:24,777
If you're not,
we need to
know why not,

123
00:06:24,851 --> 00:06:27,046
so we can start
treatment immediately.

124
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,815
Baby, let them
do the test.

125
00:06:42,535 --> 00:06:44,696
Can lead poisoning
cause visual agnosia?

126
00:06:44,771 --> 00:06:46,864
TAUB: Not without
lead showing up
in the blood work.

127
00:06:46,939 --> 00:06:50,636
Nothing in the medicine
cabinet except some
harmless toiletries.

128
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:53,474
No signs of mold
or fungus anywhere,
either.

129
00:06:53,546 --> 00:06:55,514
You think House really
got something
on your wife?

130
00:06:55,581 --> 00:06:57,913
No, not that
I care if he did.

131
00:06:58,384 --> 00:07:01,376
Wait, your wife's
doing the doorman
in your bed,

132
00:07:01,454 --> 00:07:03,979
and they're sweating
all over the sheets
that you paid for and...

133
00:07:04,056 --> 00:07:05,887
My wife's not doing
the doorman.
How do you know?

134
00:07:05,958 --> 00:07:08,392
We don't have
a doorman.

135
00:07:08,461 --> 00:07:11,259
And I just do,
okay? Drop it.

136
00:07:12,365 --> 00:07:15,664
In college, my friends
and I came up with an
Inverse-Square Law.

137
00:07:15,735 --> 00:07:17,032
Sounds like
a real fun group.

138
00:07:17,103 --> 00:07:20,470
The girls who you think
are the most inhibited,
straight arrows?

139
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:21,905
They're the ones
you hook up with.

140
00:07:21,974 --> 00:07:23,703
Are you saying
my wife's a slut?

141
00:07:23,776 --> 00:07:26,438
I'm saying if my
wife was a slut,
I'd want to know.

142
00:07:30,249 --> 00:07:31,716
KUTNER:
His place was clean.

143
00:07:31,784 --> 00:07:33,251
So is his head.

144
00:07:33,319 --> 00:07:36,550
Even with contrast,
no masses, no lesions.

145
00:07:36,622 --> 00:07:39,591
A neurological symptom
with no apparent
neurological cause.

146
00:07:39,659 --> 00:07:42,219
Time course means
we can rule out
cancer and MS.

147
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:44,195
That just leaves
toxins or drugs.

148
00:07:44,263 --> 00:07:46,891
You called Thirteen
a moron for thinking
it was drugs.

149
00:07:46,966 --> 00:07:49,161
Yeah, when she said it,
she had other options.

150
00:07:49,235 --> 00:07:52,227
And I really just wanted
a segue into her stupid
loan and your...

151
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:54,102
A cavernous angioma
in the brain could leak.

152
00:07:54,173 --> 00:07:55,470
Once the blood
gets reabsorbed,

153
00:07:55,541 --> 00:07:56,940
pressure goes down,
symptom goes away.

154
00:07:57,009 --> 00:07:59,307
He'll never consent to
petrosal vein sampling.

155
00:08:01,447 --> 00:08:02,539
Really?

156
00:08:02,615 --> 00:08:04,913
He was nervous about
an injection of contrast.

157
00:08:06,252 --> 00:08:08,152
Is his girlfriend hot?

158
00:08:08,955 --> 00:08:10,183
I'm not talking
fever, here.

159
00:08:10,256 --> 00:08:12,087
I mean, is she all
curvy and perky?

160
00:08:12,158 --> 00:08:14,592
Very. And if he dies,
it's good news for
all of us, but...

161
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:17,527
That explains why all
his paintings suck.

162
00:08:17,597 --> 00:08:19,155
And what's wrong
with him.

163
00:08:19,232 --> 00:08:20,722
Where are you going?

164
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,392
To tell him he may
have a massive
brain tumor.

165
00:08:22,468 --> 00:08:23,560
He doesn't.

166
00:08:23,636 --> 00:08:26,571
I know. I'm not a
moron. It's drugs.

167
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:28,602
(DOOR OPENS)

168
00:08:31,143 --> 00:08:33,771
You seem to have
a massive brain tumor.

169
00:08:33,846 --> 00:08:34,972
Who are you?

170
00:08:35,047 --> 00:08:37,038
He's Dr. House.
He's pleased
to meet you.

good reasons not to be
terrified in a hospital.

Since we haven't told
you you're fine,

Admirable. Not many
idiots have that
much ambition.

You've been symptom-free
since your admission,

204
00:10:06,038 --> 00:10:08,563

your system now.

What makes you think
it's a secret?

you would call it
"the" bank account.

00:14:05,611 --> 00:14:07,636
She's not sleeping around,
she's not gambling it away,

she hasn't even
spent any of it,

305
00:14:09,048 --> 00:14:11,346

a reason to
do anything.

I am.

You can't have
an imperfect thought.

You can't have
a private zone.
You can't...

hide it away in

00:14:29,935 --> 00:14:33,234
She makes me happy.
I make her happy.
It works.

315
00:14:33,305 --> 00:14:34,704
Because we
don't do storybook,

316
00:14:34,773 --> 00:14:36,798

poke into her business.

any more seizures

328
00:15:04,336 --> 00:15:05,325

You want my advice?
Of course not.

331
00:15:08,407 --> 00:15:10,705
Good, because
I have no idea
what you should do.

332
00:15:10,776 --> 00:15:12,175
I only know what
you're going to do.

333
00:15:12,244 --> 00:15:13,802
You're gonna...
I said I didn't
want your advice.

334
00:15:13,879 --> 00:15:15,176
I said this is
not advice.

335
00:15:15,247 --> 00:15:17,442
You are going
to forgive her for
opening that account,

336
00:15:17,516 --> 00:15:19,040
and you're gonna confess
everything you've done

337

00:23:23,101 --> 00:23:25,433
We're gonna need
an ice pack in here.

508
00:23:29,741 --> 00:23:32,039
<i>KUTNER: We can rule</i>
<i>out the clinical trial</i>
<i>drugs at this point.</i>

509
00:23:32,110 --> 00:23:34,044
His system has been
completely cleaned twice.

510
00:23:34,112 --> 00:23:36,171
So unless the drugs
found a hiding place
under the stairs...

511
00:23:36,248 --> 00:23:38,682
Drugs could have set off
a dormant neurological
condition.

512
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:42,652
Good point.
Coming clean causes
a lot of damage.

513
00:23:42,721 --> 00:23:44,689
Alienation, divorce...

514
00:23:45,357 --> 00:23:47,291
My wife's
buying me a car.

515
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:50,694
I was talking
about the patient.
You were wrong.

516
00:23:50,762 --> 00:23:52,730
The divorce was
metaphorical.

517
00:23:52,798 --> 00:23:54,857
FOREMAN: What about
Kl?ver-Bucy Syndrome?

518
00:23:54,933 --> 00:23:56,764
Bilateral lesions
in the temporal lobes.

519
00:23:56,835 --> 00:23:59,303
Visual agnosia
and hyper-sexuality
are the key symptoms.

520
00:23:59,371 --> 00:24:00,895
Good thing he's got
that girlfriend.

521
00:24:00,972 --> 00:24:02,963
If it's Kl?ver-Bucy,
his brain will melt down,

522
00:24:03,041 --> 00:24:04,372
he'll try to swallow
his own hands

523
00:24:04,443 --> 00:24:06,502
and she can take care
of him for the rest
of his talentless life.

524
00:24:06,578 --> 00:24:07,738
You owe me an apology.

525
00:24:07,813 --> 00:24:09,678
Any rationalization
you had for meddling

526
00:24:09,748 --> 00:24:11,579
in my private life
disappeared

527
00:24:11,650 --> 00:24:12,742
when she had
good reason...

528
00:24:12,818 --> 00:24:13,876
You're right.

529
00:24:15,387 --> 00:24:18,356
Fact is,
nothing I said applies.

530
00:24:18,423 --> 00:24:20,015
You had no reason
to forgive her,

531
00:24:20,091 --> 00:24:23,720
therefore no reason
to seek forgiveness,
no reason to be an idiot.

532
00:24:27,165 --> 00:24:29,895
Kl?ver-Bucy wouldn't
explain the seizure or
the cytokine storm.

533
00:24:29,968 --> 00:24:31,265
Withdrawal complications.

534
00:24:31,336 --> 00:24:33,827
Then again,
she is handing
you a giant gift

535
00:24:33,905 --> 00:24:35,236
that you don't think
you deserve.

536
00:24:35,307 --> 00:24:38,401
The fact that the MRI showed
no lesions on the temporal
lobe tends to rule out

537
00:24:38,477 --> 00:24:39,944
your "lesions on the
temporal lobe" theory.

538
00:24:40,011 --> 00:24:42,605
The damage can be
a circulatory issue,
rather than structural.

539
00:24:42,681 --> 00:24:44,740
We wouldn't see
that on the MRI.

540
00:24:44,816 --> 00:24:45,805
Foreman's right.

541
00:24:45,884 --> 00:24:47,545
Go call your wife,
tell her you're
not coming home,

542
00:24:47,619 --> 00:24:50,417
say you have to give
a patient a cranial
MR angiogram,

543
00:24:50,489 --> 00:24:52,957
then say good night
and hang up.

544
00:25:14,846 --> 00:25:19,806
Odd that a man who
can't run would own so
many pairs of sneakers.

545
00:25:19,885 --> 00:25:22,046
You mind hanging this
up when you're done?

546
00:25:23,154 --> 00:25:25,452
I have to find something
embarrassing about you.

547
00:25:25,524 --> 00:25:29,324
No, you don't.
I ordered us Indian.

548
00:25:29,394 --> 00:25:32,989
Not too embarrassing.
Just something credible.

549
00:25:33,064 --> 00:25:36,932
Well, if you hand her that,
she's not gonna need you
anymore.

550
00:25:37,002 --> 00:25:39,163
If I don't hand
her anything, she'll
think I'm incompetent.

551
00:25:39,237 --> 00:25:42,331
I don't care if
she thinks you're
incompetent.

552
00:25:42,407 --> 00:25:44,238
This isn't gonna work.

553
00:25:44,309 --> 00:25:46,072
It's worked so far.

554
00:25:46,144 --> 00:25:47,509
I'm not good at lying.

555
00:25:47,579 --> 00:25:48,637
I know.

556
00:25:48,713 --> 00:25:51,580
That's why your cover is
that you want to do her.

557
00:25:51,650 --> 00:25:54,517
I like her.
I don't want to do her.

558
00:25:54,586 --> 00:25:56,679
Then what's the point
of liking her?

559
00:25:56,755 --> 00:25:59,622
I meant I don't
just want to do
her. I like her.

560
00:25:59,691 --> 00:26:02,251
What do you think
you're gonna find
out about her?

561
00:26:02,994 --> 00:26:06,657
Something personal,
something embarrassing.

562
00:26:06,731 --> 00:26:10,132
I spend half my life
negotiating with
that woman.

563
00:26:10,201 --> 00:26:13,034
Anything I can
use to scare her
into saying yes.

564
00:26:17,742 --> 00:26:18,902
Okay.

565
00:26:21,346 --> 00:26:22,540
"Okay"?

566
00:26:22,614 --> 00:26:26,209
You're okay with
being paid twice to
facilitate blackmail?

567
00:26:26,284 --> 00:26:28,946
I'm okay.
I don't believe
you. But I'm okay.

568
00:26:30,388 --> 00:26:33,516
You're doing this
for the same reason
I'm doing this.

569
00:26:33,592 --> 00:26:35,389
We'll see
who gets there first.

570
00:26:39,297 --> 00:26:42,664
Here it is.
Circle of Willis,
the vessels are narrow.

571
00:26:43,535 --> 00:26:46,060
Narrow for you,
normal for him.

572
00:26:46,137 --> 00:26:47,399
If there were problems
with the vessels,

573
00:26:47,472 --> 00:26:48,905
he would have had
symptoms long ago.

574
00:26:48,974 --> 00:26:51,204
Not if something
else changed.

575
00:26:51,276 --> 00:26:52,504
Like?
TAUB: His heart.

576
00:26:52,577 --> 00:26:54,545
He could have
recently gotten an
intermittent arrhythmia.

577
00:26:54,613 --> 00:26:57,480
I know "heart" and "head"
start with the same
three letters,

578
00:26:57,549 --> 00:26:59,881
but you've got to read
all the way to the end.

579
00:26:59,951 --> 00:27:01,612
The experimental drugs
cause an arrhythmia

580
00:27:01,686 --> 00:27:03,313
which causes
low blood pressure.

581
00:27:03,421 --> 00:27:05,048
Combine that with
those narrow vessels,

582
00:27:05,123 --> 00:27:06,681
the brain doesn't
get enough blood.

583
00:27:06,758 --> 00:27:08,555
That causes all
of his symptoms.

584
00:27:08,627 --> 00:27:10,390
If we can trigger
the arrhythmia
and identify it,

585
00:27:10,462 --> 00:27:12,794
we might be able
to stop it from
killing him.

586
00:27:15,333 --> 00:27:17,062
Been home?
No.

587
00:27:18,269 --> 00:27:21,238
Good. Do an EP study.
Find the arrhythmia.

588
00:27:24,476 --> 00:27:27,104
We're gonna insert three
electrical catheters
into your heart.

589
00:27:27,178 --> 00:27:28,645
Tell Dr. Hadley
I'm sorry.

590
00:27:28,713 --> 00:27:31,409
She understands,
and you should
tell her yourself.

591
00:27:31,483 --> 00:27:32,916
Maybe I should tell
Heather about it.

592
00:27:32,984 --> 00:27:34,349
You're gonna be fine.

593
00:27:34,419 --> 00:27:38,788
She's so supportive,
she's so great.
All I do is lie to her.

594
00:27:38,857 --> 00:27:40,950
What happens if
you tell her?

595
00:27:41,493 --> 00:27:43,051
I don't know.

596
00:27:43,128 --> 00:27:44,618
You love her, right?

597
00:27:44,696 --> 00:27:46,129
More than anything,
and she loves me.

598
00:27:46,197 --> 00:27:48,563
If you open your mouth,
one of two things happens,

599
00:27:48,633 --> 00:27:50,624
she either forgives
you or she leaves you.

600
00:27:50,702 --> 00:27:53,899
At best, you wind
up exactly where
you are right now.

601
00:27:53,972 --> 00:27:56,805
It's noble to want
to confess. Really,
it is.

602
00:27:56,875 --> 00:27:59,400
But if the result's
just damage and pain,

603
00:27:59,477 --> 00:28:01,570
that's not noble,
it's selfish.

604
00:28:04,883 --> 00:28:07,283
TAUB: Stimulate right atrium.

605
00:28:07,352 --> 00:28:08,546
Normal conduction.

606
00:28:08,620 --> 00:28:10,918
How long you plan
on keeping me from
going home?

607
00:28:10,989 --> 00:28:13,150
Until you're convinced
I'm a different person,

608
00:28:13,224 --> 00:28:15,317
one who won't do
anything stupid?

609
00:28:16,327 --> 00:28:20,024
Guilt fades quickly.
By Wednesday,
you'll be fine.

610
00:28:20,865 --> 00:28:23,800
Right ventricle.
And why do you
want it to fade?

611
00:28:23,868 --> 00:28:25,893
Why do you suddenly
care about my marriage?

612
00:28:25,970 --> 00:28:28,063
Because if it
ain't broke...

613
00:28:28,139 --> 00:28:29,766
You obviously think
it is broke.

614
00:28:29,841 --> 00:28:31,240
And you obviously
think it ain't.

615
00:28:31,309 --> 00:28:33,038
Your marriage is like
a broken toaster.

616
00:28:33,111 --> 00:28:35,170
Bread keeps popping
out, and you keep
calling it toast,

617
00:28:35,246 --> 00:28:37,680
which is weird because
you've put your bread
in a lot of toasters,

618
00:28:37,749 --> 00:28:40,240
and apparently you don't
see any difference.
It's kind of fascinating.

619
00:28:40,318 --> 00:28:41,910
(MACHINE BEEPING)
He's going
into V Tach.

620
00:28:41,986 --> 00:28:42,975
What's wrong?

621
00:28:43,054 --> 00:28:45,113
Good news,
test is working.

622
00:28:45,190 --> 00:28:47,750
Your heart's freaking out,
but it's cool that you're
still conscious.

623
00:28:47,826 --> 00:28:49,191
(WHEEZING)
Try to overdrive.

624
00:28:50,028 --> 00:28:51,256

(PANTING)

626
00:28:57,569 --> 00:29:00,538
This might
burn a little bit.
Charging to 60. Clear.

627
00:29:00,972 --> 00:29:02,098
Ow!

628
00:29:03,108 --> 00:29:04,837
Going again.
Charging to 120.

629
00:29:04,909 --> 00:29:06,604
Have you been
dyeing your hair?

630
00:29:08,747 --> 00:29:10,715
No.
House. Clear.

631
00:29:10,782 --> 00:29:12,010
Right.

632
00:29:12,550 --> 00:29:13,574
(GROANS)

633
00:29:14,986 --> 00:29:16,544
Your hair's growing in red.

00:29:16,621 --> 00:29:17,986
(BRANDON PANTING)

635
00:29:18,423 --> 00:29:20,721
TAUB: His heart rate
is stabilized.

636
00:29:20,792 --> 00:29:23,022
Does your theory include
any genetic mutations

637
00:29:23,094 --> 00:29:25,324
that could cause his
hair to change color?

638
00:29:26,431 --> 00:29:29,332
Then either he's
lying about dyeing

639
00:29:30,235 --> 00:29:31,998
or just dying.

640
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:37,805
Red hair means
it's not Kl?ver-Bucy.

641
00:29:37,876 --> 00:29:40,276
Melanin affects hair
color. What affects
melanin?

642
00:29:40,345 --> 00:29:42,336
Hormones.
Hormone panels
were all normal.

643
00:29:42,413 --> 00:29:43,641
Age.

644
00:29:43,715 --> 00:29:45,376
He's turning
prematurely crimson?

645
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:46,542
FOREMAN:
A genetic disorder.

646
00:29:46,618 --> 00:29:49,587
Waardenburg Syndrome
causes arrhythmias and
can change hair color.

647
00:29:49,654 --> 00:29:51,315
And make you deaf. Next.

648
00:29:51,389 --> 00:29:54,790
I found a long QT interval.
I think it's Romano-Ward
Syndrome.

649
00:29:54,859 --> 00:29:56,417
Explains the irregular
heart rhythms.

650
00:29:56,494 --> 00:29:57,825
But not the ginger nut.

651
00:29:57,896 --> 00:30:00,330
FOREMAN: If he's got Romano's,
he's got at least five
gene mutations.

652
00:30:00,398 --> 00:30:02,832
It's not a big leap to
think he has others that
would give him the hair.

653
00:30:02,901 --> 00:30:05,836
It also gives him the
likelihood of sudden
and unexpected death.

654
00:30:05,904 --> 00:30:09,840
Beta blockers don't work.
His heart can't
handle an ICD.

Pete Best.

656
00:30:16,014 --> 00:30:19,347
Good God, has none of you
ever read a history book?

657
00:30:19,417 --> 00:30:21,612
The original
Beatles drummer.

658
00:30:21,686 --> 00:30:23,916
A bunch of nerves
controls the tempo
of the heart.

659
00:30:23,988 --> 00:30:26,456
They're all playing in time,
except one dude who
can't keep the beat,

660
00:30:26,524 --> 00:30:28,890
wrecks the whole thing,
so we hire Ringo.

661
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:30,689
Pete Best was actually
a great drummer.

662
00:30:30,762 --> 00:30:33,595
But I assume you
mean the patient needs
a cardiac sympathectomy?

663
00:30:33,665 --> 00:30:34,859
I probably should
have just said
that, huh?

664
00:30:34,933 --> 00:30:38,266
You start cutting nerves,
you risk his swallowing,
vocal cords, sweating...

665
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:41,669
So he saves a fortune
on karaoke machines
and deodorant.

666
00:30:41,739 --> 00:30:43,764
You think he's stable
enough for surgery?

667
00:30:45,577 --> 00:30:47,408
If he was,
he wouldn't need it.

668
00:30:51,549 --> 00:30:52,743

669
00:30:57,455 --> 00:30:58,922
Wow.
Yeah.

00:30:59,457 --> 00:31:01,652
Do you have
any brothers

671
00:31:01,726 --> 00:31:03,125
One sister.

He told me he was
on the lacrosse team.

673
00:31:04,662 --> 00:31:05,686
In high school.

674
00:31:05,763 --> 00:31:09,255
In college he just
cheered the lacrosse
team on to victory.

675
00:31:09,334 --> 00:31:10,733
Wow.
Yeah.

676
00:31:11,669 --> 00:31:13,603
How was your
relationship
with your dad?

677
00:31:13,705 --> 00:31:15,866
Fine. You have
three more questions.

678
00:31:15,940 --> 00:31:17,168
How was your
relationship
with your mom?

679
00:31:17,242 --> 00:31:18,300
Fine.

680
00:31:18,376 --> 00:31:20,708
When did you lose
your virginity?

681
00:31:20,778 --> 00:31:24,441
Not something I discuss
with co-workers
in an elevator.

682
00:31:26,251 --> 00:31:27,513
And...

683
00:31:28,453 --> 00:31:29,681
And...

684
00:31:32,590 --> 00:31:34,023
You know, don't you?

685
00:31:37,061 --> 00:31:39,962
Bit of a wasted
third question

686
00:31:40,031 --> 00:31:42,124
'cause the answer is
"Know what?"

687
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:43,792
Okay,
bear with me here,

688
00:31:43,868 --> 00:31:45,358
because some people
sometimes consider

689
00:31:45,436 --> 00:31:47,734
my thought processes
complicated.

690
00:31:47,805 --> 00:31:51,104
I'm into you 'cause
you're hot and smart,

691
00:31:51,175 --> 00:31:53,370
in that order,
but both are needed.

692
00:31:53,444 --> 00:31:55,071
Photos can be retouched,

693
00:31:55,146 --> 00:31:58,980
and House is an evil
genius, which makes
this photo suspicious.

694
00:31:59,050 --> 00:32:00,677
And yet you're
not suspicious.

695
00:32:00,752 --> 00:32:02,720
Which means either
you're not smart enough
to be suspicious,

696
00:32:02,787 --> 00:32:06,484
in which case, I am
less interested in you.

697
00:32:06,557 --> 00:32:09,151
Or you're
not suspicious
because you know

698
00:32:09,227 --> 00:32:11,991
this is actually
a doctored photo
of House.

699
00:32:12,063 --> 00:32:15,226
In which case, I am
more interested in you.

700
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:17,427
But I'm wasting my
time because you know

701
00:32:17,502 --> 00:32:19,026
this is a game we
are playing on you

702
00:32:19,103 --> 00:32:21,901
and I am busted
and I'm screwed.

703
00:32:24,809 --> 00:32:26,436
I know the photo's a fake.

704
00:32:27,312 --> 00:32:28,904
I know this is a game.

705
00:32:29,647 --> 00:32:30,909
Sorry.

706
00:32:33,985 --> 00:32:35,350
Too bad.

707
00:32:38,022 --> 00:32:39,114
Goodbye.

708
00:32:46,164 --> 00:32:50,157
So you knew that I
wasn't gonna give you
anything worthwhile?

709
00:32:50,234 --> 00:32:52,998
And you were
never gonna give me
anything worthwhile?

710
00:32:55,039 --> 00:32:56,802
Then why did you bother
coming out with me?

711
00:32:56,874 --> 00:32:59,434
I wanted to
screw with House.

712
00:33:00,778 --> 00:33:04,214
By wasting my time?
That doesn't make sense.

713
00:33:06,217 --> 00:33:10,153
No. There must be
another reason.

714
00:33:11,289 --> 00:33:12,347
Hmm.

715
00:33:12,423 --> 00:33:14,516
Is it okay if I
sit back down here?

716
00:33:16,127 --> 00:33:17,355
(CHUCKLES)

717
00:33:19,664 --> 00:33:21,188
<i>THIRTEEN:</i>
<i>Your heartbeat's</i>
<i>out of control.</i>

718
00:33:21,265 --> 00:33:24,723
We need to surgically sever
the connection between
your heart and brain.

719
00:33:24,802 --> 00:33:28,067
We believe it's necessary,
but you need to know
the ramifications.

720
00:33:28,139 --> 00:33:30,004
You'll never be able
to feel angina.

721
00:33:30,074 --> 00:33:32,304
You may not know
if you have a
heart attack,

722
00:33:32,377 --> 00:33:34,368
may not be able to
get help in time.

723
00:33:34,445 --> 00:33:36,777
Where are my
regular doctors?

724
00:33:36,848 --> 00:33:37,974
Regular doctors?

725
00:33:38,049 --> 00:33:39,880
Dr. Taub and Dr. Hadley.

726
00:33:39,984 --> 00:33:42,077
Why aren't they
telling me this?

727
00:33:42,153 --> 00:33:44,951
Brandon, I am Dr. Hadley,
and this is Dr. Taub.

728
00:33:45,923 --> 00:33:49,859
What are you talking
about? I've never seen
you before in my life.

729
00:33:56,334 --> 00:33:57,699
TAUB: We can't
do the surgery.

730
00:33:57,769 --> 00:33:59,498
We're back to
where we started,
visual agnosia.

731
00:33:59,570 --> 00:34:01,265
We need to re-examine
neurological disorders,

732
00:34:01,339 --> 00:34:03,136
something
slowly progressing.
This isn't progressing.

733
00:34:03,207 --> 00:34:05,368
It's there,
then it's not,
then it is.

734
00:34:05,443 --> 00:34:07,536
It's a new symptom,
intermittence.

735
00:34:08,946 --> 00:34:10,140
It's irrelevant.

736
00:34:10,214 --> 00:34:12,045
Since when is a new
symptom irrelevant?

737
00:34:12,116 --> 00:34:13,913
Since it points
towards the same
disease.

738
00:34:13,985 --> 00:34:15,612
Intermittence can fit
with Romano-Ward.

739
00:34:15,686 --> 00:34:17,278
We still need to do
a sympathectomy.

740
00:34:17,355 --> 00:34:19,220
Maybe we missed
something, toxins.

741
00:34:19,290 --> 00:34:21,690
When?
When you checked
every bottle,

742
00:34:21,759 --> 00:34:22,987
every can,
every tube of paint,

743
00:34:23,061 --> 00:34:24,528
or when you
detoxed him twice?

744
00:34:24,595 --> 00:34:26,495
Maybe there was
a batch of toxic paint

745
00:34:26,564 --> 00:34:28,156
that he used up
a few months ago.

746
00:34:28,232 --> 00:34:30,063
Then he would have
been sick months
ago, not now.

747
00:34:30,134 --> 00:34:31,761
He's lost weight
since he got here.

748
00:34:31,836 --> 00:34:33,565
That's a symptom of trying
to cram hospital food

749
00:34:33,638 --> 00:34:35,071
down a throat he can
barely get air down.

750
00:34:35,139 --> 00:34:36,197
It's not a symptom,

751
00:34:36,274 --> 00:34:40,074
but what if the toxins
were stored in his fat
cells a year ago,

752
00:34:40,144 --> 00:34:42,704
and now they're being
released into his
bloodstream?

753
00:34:44,482 --> 00:34:47,542
So where are you gonna
get this old paint,
the city dump?

754
00:34:47,618 --> 00:34:50,678
On his old paintings.
We know he hasn't
sold one in ages,

755
00:34:50,755 --> 00:34:53,986
but there weren't
many in his studio.
He's hid them somewhere.

756
00:34:55,059 --> 00:34:57,220
If you're wrong,
he could drop dead

757
00:34:57,295 --> 00:34:59,320
from Romano-Ward
at any moment.

758
00:34:59,397 --> 00:35:00,421
You okay with that?

759
00:35:00,498 --> 00:35:02,489
Just give me a few hours.

760
00:35:02,567 --> 00:35:03,829
You got one.

761
00:35:10,942 --> 00:35:12,933
I need to talk
to him alone.

762
00:35:13,010 --> 00:35:16,036
It's about your work.
Your paintings.

763
00:35:16,114 --> 00:35:19,572
I need to look
at all the ones
you've sold recently.

764
00:35:25,123 --> 00:35:26,420
Honey, can you
give us a minute?

765
00:35:26,491 --> 00:35:28,322
To talk about
your paintings?

766
00:35:30,328 --> 00:35:33,263
Brandon, please.
Tell me what's going on.

767
00:35:40,538 --> 00:35:46,204
I've only sold two
paintings in the last
three years, since we met.

768
00:35:47,445 --> 00:35:49,276
One was to my cousin.

769
00:35:49,347 --> 00:35:52,214
I've been making money
enrolling in drug trials.

770
00:35:52,283 --> 00:35:54,843
Two, three at a time.

771
00:36:01,859 --> 00:36:04,123
Why did you lie to me?

772
00:36:04,195 --> 00:36:05,526
I want to be...

773
00:36:07,832 --> 00:36:11,495
The way you look
at me, the way it
makes me feel...

774
00:36:11,569 --> 00:36:16,336
I want to be what
you see when you
look at me.

775
00:36:21,078 --> 00:36:22,875
You think
I'm that shallow?

776
00:36:24,382 --> 00:36:28,716
When I look at you,
I see you.

777
00:36:42,833 --> 00:36:43,959
So,

778
00:36:47,071 --> 00:36:49,005
where are the ones
you didn't sell?

779
00:37:02,086 --> 00:37:03,178
(THUDDING)

780
00:38:10,855 --> 00:38:12,152
(PHONE RINGING)

781
00:38:17,261 --> 00:38:19,126
It's not the paint,
it's the drugs.

782
00:38:19,196 --> 00:38:20,356
He's not on the drugs

783
00:38:20,431 --> 00:38:21,455
I know it doesn't
make sense,

784
00:38:21,532 --> 00:38:23,693
but I'm looking
at his paintings for
the last six months.

785
00:38:23,801 --> 00:38:26,793
They're normal April,
June and August,

786
00:38:26,871 --> 00:38:30,034
but they're distorted
May, July, September.

787
00:38:30,107 --> 00:38:32,405
Every other month,
he was having
visual agnosia

788
00:38:32,476 --> 00:38:35,639
because every other month,
he was on all three drugs
simultaneously.

789
00:38:35,713 --> 00:38:38,546
The statin was
one month on,
one month off.

790
00:38:38,616 --> 00:38:40,345
I don't know why
the symptoms keep
coming and going,

791
00:38:40,418 --> 00:38:41,476
but it is the drugs.

792
00:38:42,853 --> 00:38:44,582
They're hiding
under the stairs.

793
00:38:44,655 --> 00:38:46,316
In the fat?
That doesn't make sense.

794

<i>These drugs aren't</i>
<i>fat soluble.</i>

795
00:38:47,658 --> 00:38:49,785
I said stairs, not closet.

796
00:38:49,860 --> 00:38:52,693
What was the last drug
he was on before the
drugs he was on

797
00:38:52,763 --> 00:38:53,889
<i>when the symptoms started?</i>

798
00:38:53,964 --> 00:38:55,295
I'm not sure, I think...

799
00:38:55,366 --> 00:38:56,458
Antacid.

800
00:38:57,134 --> 00:38:59,068
How do you know?
<i>It makes sense.</i>

801
00:38:59,970 --> 00:39:01,767
Also, I'm looking
at the file.

803
00:39:06,777 --> 00:39:07,937
Yes.

804
00:39:11,615 --> 00:39:12,912
It's Dr. House.

805
00:39:13,818 --> 00:39:15,115
Wake him up.
We're done.

806
00:39:15,186 --> 00:39:18,349
No, no, he says
he needs surgery,
but not this one.

807
00:39:18,422 --> 00:39:19,684
Did he give
any specifics?

808
00:39:19,757 --> 00:39:22,692
Abdominal surgery
to remove a bezoar.

809
00:39:24,228 --> 00:39:28,221
It's like a hairball,
but it's made up of
undigested food.

810
00:39:28,299 --> 00:39:30,233
You can get it if your
stomach acid's low,

811
00:39:30,301 --> 00:39:33,668
which Brandon's
was because of an
experimental antacid.

<i>all three at once.</i>

819

let Cameron buy a cat.

820
00:40:01,098 --> 00:40:02,497
He should be fine.

Are you glad
he told you the truth?

823
00:40:08,105 --> 00:40:09,902
Yes. Of course.

824
00:40:12,209 --> 00:40:16,168
But were you happier
before you knew?

825
00:40:25,055 --> 00:40:27,216
About 10 more feet.

826
00:40:27,291 --> 00:40:29,725
I do know what it looks
like, so maybe this whole
blindfold thing...

00:40:29,794 --> 00:40:33,252
Shh. My gift, my rules.
Bump!

828
00:40:34,398 --> 00:40:36,298
All right, if you
don't like the color,

829
00:40:36,367 --> 00:40:37,493
apparently we
can exchange it,

830
00:40:37,568 --> 00:40:40,128

You ready?

Baby, are you okay?

00:41:06,831 --> 00:41:08,264

00:41:45,703 --> 00:41:49,298
On the other hand,
I figured she probably
wouldn't figure me

844
00:41:49,373 --> 00:41:54,208
as the "Photoshopping a photo
and planting it in an obscure
college paper" type either.

845
00:41:54,345 --> 00:41:57,212
(CHUCKLES)
Yeah. About that,

846
00:41:58,849 --> 00:42:01,010
I took a little trip
to your alma mater.

847
00:42:02,686 --> 00:42:06,383
You took a little
trip 150 miles?

848
00:42:06,457 --> 00:42:10,655
Online, by phone.
I meant I did research.

849
00:42:16,267 --> 00:42:17,928
That's a real photo,
isn't it?

850
00:42:19,603 --> 00:42:20,797
(EXCLAIMS)

851
00:42:20,871 --> 00:42:22,532
Wow, that is humiliating.

852
00:42:22,606 --> 00:42:24,130
(PIANO PLAYING)

853
00:42:25,342 --> 00:42:26,866
There was a girl.

854
00:42:28,479 --> 00:42:30,310
Even more so.

855
00:42:30,381 --> 00:42:32,941
That's too bad.
You wanted her to see
you in a different light,

856
00:42:33,017 --> 00:42:35,850
and not only
didn't she see it,

857
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:38,480
but she didn't even
believe it was possible.

858
00:42:39,890 --> 00:42:43,519
You know, people
hate people who have
theories about people.

859
00:42:52,369 --> 00:42:54,098
You want me to back off?

860
00:42:54,171 --> 00:42:56,105
Would you?

861
00:42:56,173 --> 00:42:57,640
I barely know you.

862
00:42:57,908 --> 00:42:59,842
(HARMONIZING)
