You made your point,
now how about letting us
do our job?

00:00:37,504 --> 00:00:40,564
Our point will be made
when your company stops
tearing down this mountain.

Then who's gonna
feed our kids? You?

If you really cared
about your kids,

6
00:00:43,910 --> 00:00:46,208
you'd want them to
have air to breathe
when they grow up.

What did you say,
you son of a bitch?

Coal is the dirtiest

12
00:00:58,358 --> 00:00:59,620

She needs to get
to a hospital.

She's just dehydrated.
We have medics here.
Let them give her fluids.

18
00:01:17,143 --> 00:01:18,303
She has no pulse.

19
00:01:19,712 --> 00:01:21,942
Either unhook your arm
or I'm gonna break it off.

I found you a board,
perfect size to learn on.

00:03:09,022 --> 00:03:10,853
I'm just postponing.
O'Neil, from Philly General,

35
00:03:10,924 --> 00:03:12,824
wants me to get a patient
in to see House.

36
00:03:12,892 --> 00:03:13,984
So?

37
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:15,254
I owe him a favor.

38
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:17,819
He's taken about
a dozen of my referrals
over the last year.

39
00:03:17,897 --> 00:03:21,389
I meant, so,
that's five seconds
to hand House the file,

40
00:03:21,501 --> 00:03:23,696
30 for him to question
your real motives,

41
00:03:23,770 --> 00:03:25,067
a minute for
witty comments

42
00:03:25,171 --> 00:03:27,696
comparing the length
of your legs
to Thirteen's...

43
00:03:27,774 --> 00:03:29,036
Plenty of time left over
for the shore.

44
00:03:29,108 --> 00:03:31,235
I need to make sure
he doesn't toss
the file in the trash

45
00:03:31,311 --> 00:03:32,505
as soon as
I'm out of sight.

46
00:03:32,579 --> 00:03:35,173
Babe, can't you
repay the favor
on another case?

47
00:03:35,615 --> 00:03:38,584
After last week,
I could really use
a break from this place.

48
00:03:38,651 --> 00:03:39,845
We both could.

49
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:43,489
Once I'm sure
he's really on the case,

50
00:03:43,556 --> 00:03:45,148
then we're out of here.

51
00:03:45,425 --> 00:03:48,223
And these legs, and
every other part of me,
will be all yours.

52
00:03:52,599 --> 00:03:54,794
He's seen three
different specialists.

53
00:03:54,867 --> 00:03:56,732
Interesting.

54
00:03:56,803 --> 00:03:59,567
Almost as interesting
as you trying to step
into Kutner's shoes

55
00:03:59,639 --> 00:04:01,504
just days after
he stepped out of them.

CAMERON: I am not
shoe shopping,

57
00:04:03,776 --> 00:04:06,074
I'm just trying
to repay a favor to
his referring doctor.

58
00:04:06,145 --> 00:04:07,169
What's the mystery?

59
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:10,739

free time wreaking havoc
at toxic waste dumps.

Tox screen's negative.

61
00:04:11,951 --> 00:04:15,216
No neurological, muscular
or cardiovascular
abnormalities.

62
00:04:15,288 --> 00:04:17,779
The guy cares
about the environment,
that makes him a nutcase?

63
00:04:17,890 --> 00:04:19,289
TAUB: He's a single guy
in his 20s,

64
00:04:19,392 --> 00:04:21,792
he cares about getting
his hybrid waxed by girls

65
00:04:21,861 --> 00:04:22,953
who care about
the environment.

66
00:04:23,062 --> 00:04:25,087
See? Not a nutcase.

67
00:04:25,164 --> 00:04:26,654
He's probably just faking
so he can sue the cops

68
00:04:26,766 --> 00:04:27,824
and get a six-figure
settlement.

69
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:29,162
If he was trying
to fake an illness,

70
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:32,500
why would he consent
to be seen by the best
diagnostician in the country?

71
00:04:32,605 --> 00:04:35,597
Now look who's trying
to get her hybrid waxed.

72
00:04:35,675 --> 00:04:37,973
We need to do
a vestibular
caloric test,

73
00:04:38,077 --> 00:04:40,739
see if the balance
problem starts above
or below the neck.

74
00:04:40,813 --> 00:04:43,475
And when I say "we,"
I mean you.

75
00:04:43,583 --> 00:04:46,143
You're the one
with a favor to
repay, not them.

76
00:04:52,659 --> 00:04:55,492
I'm going to be
injecting ice-water
in your ear canal.

77
00:04:55,595 --> 00:04:57,756
If the resulting
eye movements
are at all erratic,

78
00:04:57,830 --> 00:05:00,526
then the balance problem's
in your inner ear.

79
00:05:00,633 --> 00:05:02,828
Those in every room?

80
00:05:02,902 --> 00:05:04,096
I think so.

81
00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:08,129
Can you get rid of them?
Preferably from every room?

82
00:05:08,207 --> 00:05:11,301
They use over 30 pesticides
to grow commercial flowers.

83
00:05:11,377 --> 00:05:12,969
You'd think
the medical industry
would be a lot more...

84
00:05:13,046 --> 00:05:14,274
Concerned with medicine?

85
00:05:14,347 --> 00:05:16,872
Let's fix your body,
then you can go back
to fixing the Earth.

86
00:05:16,983 --> 00:05:18,143
This is gonna get
a little uncomfortable.

87
00:05:18,217 --> 00:05:20,344
I just spent 14 hours
chained to a tire.

88
00:05:20,453 --> 00:05:21,852
Most doctors
would recommend...

89
00:05:21,921 --> 00:05:23,684
Our planet's headed
for destruction.

90
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:26,623
Coastlines underwater,
a million species extinct.

91
00:05:26,693 --> 00:05:30,459
Whoa! Feels like
I'm tumbling
head over heels.

92
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:33,090
It's normal. Sometimes
this test causes vertigo

93
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:37,568
and nausea.

94
00:05:40,006 --> 00:05:42,531
Cameron just
brought me a case.

95
00:05:42,608 --> 00:05:44,667
Cameron is happy
in the ER.

96
00:05:44,744 --> 00:05:47,736
There's no way
she wants her nose
back on your grindstone.

97
00:05:48,414 --> 00:05:51,577
Egg-white omelet,
no bacon,
whole-wheat toast.

98
00:05:51,684 --> 00:05:54,016
I say it's not
my grindstone
she's after,

99
00:05:54,087 --> 00:05:55,884
and not her nose
she wants on it.

100
00:05:55,988 --> 00:05:58,388
She and Chase
are practically
living together.

101
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:02,457
What did you just order?

102
00:06:02,528 --> 00:06:03,893
An omelet.

103
00:06:04,931 --> 00:06:07,229
Since when do you
pass on the swine?

104
00:06:08,067 --> 00:06:11,525
And wheat toast?
Might as well eat
a sheet of sandpaper.

105
00:06:11,604 --> 00:06:14,971
Yes, but I don't like
eating the same thing
two days in a row.

106
00:06:15,074 --> 00:06:17,634
Your bro's nurse
not loving
the love handles?

107
00:06:17,744 --> 00:06:19,644
I'm just not
in the mood
for bacon,

108
00:06:19,746 --> 00:06:22,271
and you are obviously
trying to avoid
talking about Kutner,

109
00:06:22,382 --> 00:06:25,818
which is odd because
you spent a whole week
obsessing about why...

110
00:06:25,918 --> 00:06:27,943
He's no longer
on my team.

111
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:29,578
I'm sorry he's
no longer on my team.

112
00:06:29,655 --> 00:06:31,486
There's nothing else
to talk about.

113
00:06:33,259 --> 00:06:36,422
You're wearing the
watch he gave you
for Secret Santa.

114
00:06:36,496 --> 00:06:38,794
Five functions,
including a stopwatch

115
00:06:38,898 --> 00:06:41,560
to time how long
it takes you to
ask me if I'm okay.

116
00:06:42,568 --> 00:06:43,933
You gonna order?

117
00:06:45,972 --> 00:06:47,405
Not hungry.

118
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:53,311
It's just weird.
She's brought cases before,

119
00:06:53,379 --> 00:06:54,971
but he's never made her
run the tests.

120
00:06:55,081 --> 00:06:58,107
Maybe he's looking for
someone to mother him
after what happened.

121
00:06:58,184 --> 00:06:59,481
The only kind of
mothering House wants

122
00:06:59,585 --> 00:07:02,418
involves a bullwhip,
leather diapers
and a credit card.

123
00:07:04,457 --> 00:07:05,947
Mommy's home.

124
00:07:08,828 --> 00:07:11,661
Test made the patient lose
his lunch, but his calorics
are normal,

125
00:07:11,764 --> 00:07:14,130
his inner ear is fine
and he still can't
balance himself.

126
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:15,792
How many normal test
results do we need

127
00:07:15,868 --> 00:07:17,995
to know the patient's
a granola-filled phony?

128
00:07:18,104 --> 00:07:19,594
He's not lying
about his symptoms.

129
00:07:19,672 --> 00:07:20,969
And you know this
because...

130
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:23,031
She changed her shoes.

131
00:07:23,142 --> 00:07:26,009
If he was faking,
he'd have vomited on
the other side of the bed.

132
00:07:26,112 --> 00:07:29,878
Sparring with the police
and chaining yourself up
for days can cause stress.

133
00:07:29,982 --> 00:07:31,643
Stress screws with
the heart and arteries.

134
00:07:31,717 --> 00:07:34,185
Carotid atherosclerosis
could cause a loss
of balance.

135
00:07:34,287 --> 00:07:36,448
Wouldn't show up
on CT or MRI.

136
00:07:36,522 --> 00:07:39,457
It could also be our
only warning before
a massive stroke.

137
00:07:39,525 --> 00:07:42,085
(SIGHS) Do a Holter
and a carotid doppler,

138
00:07:42,161 --> 00:07:44,994
see if his heart skips
for more than
the Spotted Owl.

139
00:07:45,531 --> 00:07:49,558
Although I didn't
say "we," if I had...

00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:02,379
(HICCUPPING)

141
00:08:02,582 --> 00:08:04,880
Sorry if this is
screwing up the test.

142
00:08:04,984 --> 00:08:08,476
Been hiccupping
a lot lately, but
not as bad as this.

143
00:08:08,554 --> 00:08:10,681
How much is a lot?
And how long is lately?

144
00:08:10,756 --> 00:08:12,986
It's been on and off
for about a week.

145
00:08:13,059 --> 00:08:15,027
Maybe a few hours a day.

146
00:08:15,094 --> 00:08:16,823
Did you tell the doctors
in Philly about it?

147
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:20,063
They didn't seem to think
it was any big deal.

148
00:08:25,338 --> 00:08:27,272
Hey, so we're still
leaving tomorrow,
aren't we?

149
00:08:27,373 --> 00:08:29,603
I'm not sure.

150
00:08:29,709 --> 00:08:32,837
The referring doctors
didn't realize that
his hiccups were...

151
00:08:32,912 --> 00:08:34,174
Hiccups?

152
00:08:34,547 --> 00:08:37,345
With this
duration and intensity,
most likely pathological,

153
00:08:37,416 --> 00:08:39,213
and it could mean
it's serious.

154
00:08:40,286 --> 00:08:41,719
Are you avoiding me?

155
00:08:41,787 --> 00:08:42,913
No.

156
00:08:43,022 --> 00:08:44,887
So, I shouldn't be
at all concerned

157
00:08:44,957 --> 00:08:47,517
that you're treating another
doctor's patient for hiccups

158
00:08:47,593 --> 00:08:50,585
instead of going on
the vacation I spent
a week planning?

159
00:08:53,432 --> 00:08:56,697
There is a reason I need
to stay with this case
a while longer,

160
00:08:56,769 --> 00:08:59,863
but I can't tell you
what it is.

161
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:05,740
So, you admit you
lied to me, now you're
asking me to trust you.

162
00:09:07,346 --> 00:09:08,608
Yes.

163
00:09:12,518 --> 00:09:13,678
Okay.

164
00:09:23,296 --> 00:09:25,093
No sign of heart
or arterial problems,

165
00:09:25,164 --> 00:09:27,257
but he's been hiccupping
on and off for over a week.

166
00:09:27,333 --> 00:09:31,633
Nice. I'm hooked.
You can get back to
your shift at the ER,

167
00:09:31,737 --> 00:09:34,297
except, as far as
the ER is concerned,
you're on vacation, right?

168
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:37,103
I postponed a trip
because I'm concerned
about the patient.

169
00:09:37,176 --> 00:09:39,269
Explains why
you ditched Chase and
came to the differentials,

170
00:09:39,345 --> 00:09:40,369
not why you ran
the tests.

171
00:09:40,446 --> 00:09:41,879
You told me to.

172
00:09:41,948 --> 00:09:43,108
Well, I'm not your boss,

173
00:09:43,182 --> 00:09:45,173
something you usually
take great pleasure
in pointing out.

174
00:09:45,284 --> 00:09:48,310
Hey, you don't still
have the hots for me,
do you?

175
00:09:49,622 --> 00:09:52,648
I care about the patient
and I care about the people
who work on your team,

176
00:09:52,725 --> 00:09:54,283
they've been through
a lot lately.

177
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:56,453
I just thought I...
Was Florence Nightingale

178
00:09:56,529 --> 00:09:58,690
and you're gonna nurse us
back to spiritual
and mental oneness.

179
00:09:58,798 --> 00:10:01,494
That would make sense
if we were having this
conversation a week ago.

180
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:03,262
Think what you want,
that I'm here to
get a job,

181
00:10:03,336 --> 00:10:05,304
that I'm here
to wrap you in
swaddling clothes.

182
00:10:06,839 --> 00:10:09,535
Problem is, I think neither.
Because neither makes sense.

183
00:10:10,943 --> 00:10:14,310
The only thing
that does, doesn't.

184
00:10:20,853 --> 00:10:24,914
Pathological hiccups
plus inability
to balance, go.

185
00:10:26,392 --> 00:10:27,984
What she said.

186
00:10:29,328 --> 00:10:30,693
Brain would connect the two.

187
00:10:30,763 --> 00:10:34,199
It could if Cameron
hadn't already CT'd
his head.

boyfriend's calendar.

189
00:10:36,302 --> 00:10:38,270
What does this have
to do with Chase?

190
00:10:38,371 --> 00:10:39,770
Nothing.
Not sure yet.

191
00:10:40,439 --> 00:10:42,407
Patient is
on a jihad against
commercial flowers,

192
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:43,772
he's picketed
several nurseries.

193
00:10:43,843 --> 00:10:46,038
Organophosphate poisoning
can cause both hiccups and...

194
00:10:46,112 --> 00:10:47,875
No GI problems,
no hypersalivation.

195
00:10:47,947 --> 00:10:50,211
It's possible it's not
connected to a protest.

196
00:10:50,282 --> 00:10:53,046
MS wouldn't show on the CT,
and his name is Swenson.

197
00:10:53,119 --> 00:10:55,952
Scandinavians
have an increased
susceptibility to MS.

198
00:10:56,389 --> 00:10:58,289
Better theory than,
"He's faking it."

199
00:10:59,225 --> 00:11:02,490
The clogs have it.
Do a lumbar puncture
to confirm MS.

200
00:11:05,798 --> 00:11:08,232
I guess we'll just
continue to twiddle
our thumbs.

201
00:11:08,934 --> 00:11:10,959
God, I hope
that's a euphemism.

202
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:12,401
How am I supposed to
do a lumbar puncture

203
00:11:12,471 --> 00:11:14,132
on a patient with
intractable hiccups?

204
00:11:14,206 --> 00:11:17,403
I'm trying to figure out
what that could be
a euphemism for.

You're not worried House
is gonna be pissed you're
helping me do the test?

209
00:11:30,089 --> 00:11:32,319
He said find a way,
and you did.

House is doing?

Yeah.

No, it isn't.

214
00:11:41,167 --> 00:11:44,295
Even if House was messed up
by Kutner's suicide,
it wouldn't matter.

215
00:11:44,403 --> 00:11:47,463
He already thinks
life is nasty,
brutish and long,

216

and misery helps
his diagnostic skills.

All of which you know,
so, why are you here?

would you believe?

If you want Kutner's place,
it's fine by me.

with the stones to
stand up to House.

But you've got to know
that's gonna blow up your

in getting back

She's been running
all the tests

Well, she hasn't said
anything to me.

00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:52,701
But I guess the referring
doctor might have asked her
to keep an eye on him.

Do you think Cameron's
in love with House?

That is a ridiculous question.
She's in love with you.

Are you in love
with House?

240
00:13:06,418 --> 00:13:10,047
That is an even more
ridiculous question.

His history said
the environmental

He probably didn't
want me to worry.

248

He told me he was
in jail with some of
the other protesters.

Yeah, well,
no worries there.

Not so often in
the hospital.

and I found the referral
to you yesterday.

It's so bland it doesn't
even taste like kale.

that he's a liar,
so we're making...

Who told you
that I was in here?

261

The doctor in the office
next to yours said that
you might be here.

You're not doing a favor

00:14:51,457 --> 00:14:54,290
you're doing a favor

271
00:14:58,530 --> 00:15:01,294
Wilson sees you
10 times more than I do,
he's a better liar,

272
00:15:01,367 --> 00:15:04,029
and he wouldn't have
to cancel a vacation
to do it.

explain the diet.

It's torticollis,
reaction to
the chlorpromazine.

283
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:32,793
That's not just a spasm,
it's swollen.

FOREMAN: It's definitely
not MS.

286
00:15:41,173 --> 00:15:43,004
Crunching sounds were
caused by an air leak
between his lungs.

287
00:15:43,075 --> 00:15:45,873
CAMERON: The leak in his
mediastinum could've been
caused by prolonged hiccups.

288
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:47,378
More likely it was
the neck spasm.

289
00:15:47,446 --> 00:15:48,708
CAMERON: Most likely
it was there all along.

290
00:15:48,781 --> 00:15:50,908
We just didn't notice
until the other symptoms
made it worse.

291
00:15:51,016 --> 00:15:54,349
So, what causes
loss of balance,
pathological hiccups,

292
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:56,354
and a hole in
his Gloria Steinem?

293

He was protesting

294
00:15:58,590 --> 00:16:00,524

If a solvent got absorbed
through his lungs, caused

299
00:16:10,569 --> 00:16:13,470
Start him on
IV methylprednisolone
for systemic sclerosis.

300
00:16:13,572 --> 00:16:15,267
Do a full work-up
to confirm.

301
00:16:15,374 --> 00:16:17,205
By myself?
Without yourself.

302
00:16:18,811 --> 00:16:21,746
Grab a bat.
Grab some pine.

303
00:16:21,814 --> 00:16:23,247
Time to bring in
the first string.

304
00:16:29,488 --> 00:16:30,614
Why?

305
00:16:31,256 --> 00:16:34,316
You obviously
want to be here.
I can't figure out why.

306
00:16:34,426 --> 00:16:37,088
So I want to see
where you go when
you can't be here.

307
00:16:59,618 --> 00:17:01,381
You know what vacation
means, right?

308
00:17:01,487 --> 00:17:03,978
You here because of House,
Chase, or overtime issues?

309
00:17:04,056 --> 00:17:07,856
He's very concerned.
Chase, not House.

310
00:17:07,926 --> 00:17:08,950
If it's all right
with you,

311
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:11,496

with Chase by communicating
with Chase.

with House?

313
00:17:19,204 --> 00:17:23,197
You are not
concerned about me.

314
00:17:23,275 --> 00:17:24,742
You're marking
your territory.

315
00:17:25,844 --> 00:17:27,971
You shouldn't be
involved with House,

316
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:29,605
neither should I,
neither should anyone.

317
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:35,184
You and Chase
are good together.
Don't screw it up.

318
00:17:41,927 --> 00:17:43,622
FRANNI: When are you
gonna stop this?

319
00:17:43,695 --> 00:17:45,162
How can you
ask me to stop?

320
00:17:45,464 --> 00:17:48,331
You're in a hospital.
You have a son.

321
00:17:49,501 --> 00:17:52,334
The steroids ought to get him
breathing normally again.

322
00:17:52,404 --> 00:17:54,668
But autoimmune diseases
are serious.

323
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:58,107
Might not be a bad idea
to take some time at home,
rest up.

324
00:17:58,610 --> 00:18:00,373
(BREATHING HEAVILY)
I can't just quit.

325
00:18:02,047 --> 00:18:04,106
Do you hate us
that much?

326
00:18:04,183 --> 00:18:07,118
I love you,
and I love our son.

327
00:18:08,587 --> 00:18:11,385
But why should he
matter more than
everyone else's?

328
00:18:12,124 --> 00:18:13,113
He does.

329
00:18:13,192 --> 00:18:14,284
Why?

330
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:18,286
Because he's biologically
connected to me?

331
00:18:18,363 --> 00:18:20,627
There's no rational reason.

332
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,124

that I'd eaten hours ago,

you were going to move on
to your real entree,

or you know that
I'd find something,

I'm gonna assume the former

I assume they were checking
for vascular pulsation.

381
00:20:47,479 --> 00:20:49,413
Either it's negative
or he's a big wuss.

382

It's not a tumor

But the bone covering
might not be.

If it's osteomyelitis,
an infection eating away
at his periosteum...

You can monitor

between here and home?

445
00:24:03,475 --> 00:24:04,533
Hmm.

00:24:04,609 --> 00:24:07,339
There's less
medical equipment,
more training bras,

447

and more
Vegemite sandwiches.

448
00:24:10,348 --> 00:24:13,044
Actually, technically,
right now Chase is here,

449
00:24:13,151 --> 00:24:14,948
but that's because
I called him and
you didn't know that,

450
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:20,151
and it's irrelevant
to my point, which is
you and Chase are over.

451
00:24:21,726 --> 00:24:23,193
You are wrong.

452
00:24:23,295 --> 00:24:27,254
You decided that his
single drawer of clothes
is one drawer too many.

453
00:24:27,332 --> 00:24:28,594
But you don't have
the guts to tell him,

454
00:24:28,667 --> 00:24:34,037
so you're emotionally
walking away instead of
actually walking away,

455
00:24:34,139 --> 00:24:37,302
which is stupid because
only one of those is
good for your heart.

456
00:24:44,683 --> 00:24:46,810
He's gonna ask me
to marry him.

457
00:24:49,154 --> 00:24:53,215
I was looking for
some thick socks,
found the ring.

458
00:24:55,927 --> 00:24:57,690
And you want to say no.

459
00:24:57,762 --> 00:25:00,731

to his single drawer

I don't want him to ask.

465
00:25:23,121 --> 00:25:25,954
I don't want him to propose

You ask a question,
I rule out two possibilities,
and you're satisfied?

489
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:37,355
That means you don't
want an answer,

490
00:26:37,462 --> 00:26:40,158
you just wanted
to know there wasn't
a particular answer.

491
00:26:40,265 --> 00:26:42,256
Either you were worried
that she wanted back
on my team

492

or you were worried
she wanted back on me.

This isn't
a medical crisis,
is it?

494
00:26:48,373 --> 00:26:51,706
Could be. A lot of STDs
hang in the balance.

I give up.

Tried to help
a sister out.

501
00:27:25,910 --> 00:27:28,174
The nuclei were
all normal-sized,

502
00:27:28,246 --> 00:27:30,339
bone cells are
well-differentiated.

503
00:27:30,415 --> 00:27:32,383
No dysplasia means
no cancer.

504
00:27:32,450 --> 00:27:33,815
That's good, isn't it?

505
00:27:33,885 --> 00:27:37,946
We hope so, although it also
means we still have no idea
what caused the break.

506
00:27:38,323 --> 00:27:39,654
How does it feel?

507
00:27:39,724 --> 00:27:41,021
It hurts.

508
00:27:44,996 --> 00:27:46,395
Is it supposed
to look like that?

509
00:27:46,498 --> 00:27:49,729
No, but it's probably
just residual bleeding
from the surgery.

510
00:27:49,801 --> 00:27:51,428
We should be able to...

511
00:27:56,007 --> 00:27:58,271
Need two units of FFP,
right away.

512
00:27:58,376 --> 00:27:59,638
Oh, my God.
What's happening?

513
00:27:59,711 --> 00:28:00,803
He's bleeding out.

514
00:28:06,017 --> 00:28:07,348
Means it's gotta
be cancer.

515
00:28:07,419 --> 00:28:09,717
It's gotta be,
except it's not.
The biopsy was negative.

516
00:28:09,788 --> 00:28:11,722
Biopsies can be wrong,
symptoms can't.

517
00:28:11,790 --> 00:28:15,658
All signs point to cancer,
but you can't blast a cancer
you can't find.

518
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:19,753
Sure you can.
Prep him for
total-body irradiation.

519
00:28:19,831 --> 00:28:21,992
You do realize
that's insane.

520
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:25,228
Not unless you think
the cancer's cleverly
hiding outside his body.

521
00:28:25,303 --> 00:28:26,668
Steroids already weakened
his immune system.

522
00:28:26,771 --> 00:28:29,501
That much radiation
will kill him before
it kills the cancer.

523
00:28:29,607 --> 00:28:31,632
And if he doesn't have cancer,
we could cause one,

524
00:28:31,743 --> 00:28:33,472
or destroy his
immune system altogether.

525
00:28:33,545 --> 00:28:34,978
The guy could die
from an infected toenail.

526
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:37,480
So you'd rather do nothing,
just let him die on his own?

527
00:28:37,582 --> 00:28:39,174
I'd rather make
his cancer worse.

528
00:28:42,754 --> 00:28:46,315
Give him insulin-like
growth factor, make any
tumor or malignancy grow.

529
00:28:46,424 --> 00:28:48,051
Grows big enough,
we can find it.

530
00:28:48,126 --> 00:28:49,821
That's like pouring
gasoline on a fire.

531
00:28:49,928 --> 00:28:52,260
At least total-body
irradiation is
an actual treatment.

532
00:28:55,767 --> 00:28:58,600
His idea is better.
Pour away.

533
00:29:14,219 --> 00:29:16,016
I've lost my mojo.

534
00:29:17,055 --> 00:29:18,886
Have you retraced
your steps?

535
00:29:18,990 --> 00:29:20,821
Does your cleaning lady
check your pockets before...

536
00:29:20,892 --> 00:29:25,022
I was clueless about Kutner,
I was wrong about Cameron,

537
00:29:25,864 --> 00:29:29,857
Taub just came up
with an idea that I should
have seen long before he did.

538
00:29:29,968 --> 00:29:32,493
No one saw anything
coming with Kutner,

539
00:29:32,570 --> 00:29:33,969
you hardly ever see
Cameron anymore,

540
00:29:34,038 --> 00:29:38,065
and you hired Taub to
come up with ideas that you
wouldn't have come up with.

541
00:29:38,176 --> 00:29:40,644
And I have no idea
why you're eating carrots.

542
00:29:40,712 --> 00:29:41,872
Good.

543
00:29:42,647 --> 00:29:45,912
I'm losing my mind,
all you got to say
is, "Good"?

544
00:29:46,017 --> 00:29:48,815
House, a guy you worked
with for two years,
who you mentored,

545
00:29:48,887 --> 00:29:52,482
and, yes,
possibly even cared about,
just blew his brains out.

546
00:29:53,491 --> 00:29:55,823
You can't find the
reason, can't find
the meaning in it,

547
00:29:55,894 --> 00:29:57,259
because sometimes
there isn't any.

548
00:29:57,328 --> 00:30:00,422
Sometimes
this is all there is.

549
00:30:01,499 --> 00:30:03,160
You should be losing it.

550
00:30:03,234 --> 00:30:05,964
You'd be crazy
not to be off your game.

551
00:30:06,037 --> 00:30:08,028
But your mojo's
right where
you left it.

552
00:30:08,439 --> 00:30:10,600
Just keep playing with it.

553
00:30:11,576 --> 00:30:14,670
I gotta go.
Help yourself.

554
00:30:19,918 --> 00:30:21,749
I know this is
a tough process.

555
00:30:21,853 --> 00:30:24,413
At the first sign
of any tumors
or masses we can...

556
00:30:24,522 --> 00:30:26,353
Start saying prayers?

557
00:30:26,424 --> 00:30:28,892
It's gonna be okay.
Once we can...
No, it is not gonna be okay.

558
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:30,587
You're growing
his cancer.

559
00:30:30,662 --> 00:30:32,596
This isn't
the doctors' fault.

560
00:30:33,464 --> 00:30:38,026
I've exposed myself
to a lot of bad stuff.
I knew the risks.

561
00:30:38,770 --> 00:30:40,567
(WHEEZING)

562
00:30:40,872 --> 00:30:44,364
I want my life
to mean something,

563
00:30:44,442 --> 00:30:46,307
and if that means
I'm destined to...

564
00:30:48,213 --> 00:30:49,908
(EKG ALARM BLARING)

565
00:30:49,981 --> 00:30:52,609
He's in V-tach,
and no pulse.
Grab the paddles.

566
00:30:52,717 --> 00:30:53,945
Oh, God.

567
00:30:56,888 --> 00:30:58,822
Charging. Clear.

568
00:30:59,891 --> 00:31:01,586
Charging. Clear.

569
00:31:04,829 --> 00:31:07,263
I've been looking for you.

570
00:31:07,332 --> 00:31:09,425
And I've been
thinking about you.

571
00:31:11,169 --> 00:31:14,798
Just hadn't reached
the looking stage yet.

572
00:31:14,873 --> 00:31:16,397
Which is the problem.

573
00:31:18,276 --> 00:31:21,404
You asked for a day,
I gave you two.

574
00:31:21,479 --> 00:31:25,279
You told me you had
a secret you couldn't
share, I respected that.

575
00:31:25,350 --> 00:31:26,647
Now I don't know
what's worse,

576
00:31:26,751 --> 00:31:28,810
blowing off our vacation
to hang around House,

577
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:31,354
or continuing to
blow it off when
he won't hang around you.

578
00:31:31,456 --> 00:31:33,117
If you think I'm the
least bit interested
in House...

579
00:31:33,191 --> 00:31:35,625
I don't know what
I'm supposed to think.

580
00:31:36,961 --> 00:31:38,986
I know this looks bad
and...

581
00:31:39,063 --> 00:31:41,998
I don't care how it looks,
I care what it is.

582
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:44,466
And you're not
telling me what it is.

583
00:31:44,535 --> 00:31:46,833
I'm trying to
trust you, but...

584
00:31:51,376 --> 00:31:52,502
I just...

585
00:31:56,281 --> 00:31:57,976
I need a little more time.

586
00:32:02,053 --> 00:32:03,077
No.

587
00:32:05,023 --> 00:32:09,517
This has nothing
to do with House.

588
00:32:09,627 --> 00:32:14,860
Yeah, well, it has
nothing to do with me
either, not anymore.

589
00:32:21,005 --> 00:32:23,701
Let me know
when I can come
pick up my things.

590
00:32:40,725 --> 00:32:42,716
TAUB: Nothing on the echo.
We drew a troponin level,

591
00:32:42,827 --> 00:32:44,590
no signs of
myocardial ischemia.

592
00:32:44,662 --> 00:32:45,822
All the tests were normal.

593
00:32:47,265 --> 00:32:51,201
Loss of balance,
pathological hiccups,
air leak between the lungs,

594
00:32:51,269 --> 00:32:54,363
broken femur,
now tachycardia. Go.

595
00:32:59,043 --> 00:33:01,409
Come on, give me something.
Give me a bad idea,

596
00:33:01,512 --> 00:33:03,377
maybe I can turn it
into a good one.

597
00:33:09,954 --> 00:33:13,446
Fine. Open him up,
put in a defibrillator.

598
00:33:13,524 --> 00:33:15,014
FOREMAN: That's permanent
and risky.

599
00:33:15,093 --> 00:33:17,254
We don't even know what,
if anything, is wrong
with his heart.

600
00:33:17,362 --> 00:33:18,590
Redo all the tests.

601
00:33:18,663 --> 00:33:22,360
In the meantime,
open him up,
put in a defibrillator,

602
00:33:22,433 --> 00:33:25,231
so he can live long enough
for you to finish the tests.

603
00:33:39,650 --> 00:33:43,746
Balance organs, nerves,
lungs, bones, heart.

604
00:33:44,989 --> 00:33:48,823
Things you use
to make bratwurst?

605
00:33:48,926 --> 00:33:51,554
There's no sign
of infection,

606
00:33:51,629 --> 00:33:54,393
it's not a metabolic
or autoimmune disease.

607
00:33:54,465 --> 00:33:57,093
It's definitely not cancer.
I think.

608
00:33:57,168 --> 00:33:58,465
Definitely not cancer.

609
00:34:01,572 --> 00:34:02,971
Aren't you gonna pick?

610
00:34:03,041 --> 00:34:05,032
I'm thinking.
Is there
a ticking clock?

611
00:34:05,977 --> 00:34:08,775
You already
put your money in.

612
00:34:08,846 --> 00:34:11,110
You never do that
until you decide.

613
00:34:11,182 --> 00:34:12,342
That's very observant of you.

614
00:34:12,450 --> 00:34:16,910
Too bad you distracted me.
Now I'm thinking I might
change my mind.

615
00:34:20,525 --> 00:34:22,220
There's nothing healthy
in that machine.

616
00:34:22,293 --> 00:34:24,056
No, there's not.

617
00:34:28,933 --> 00:34:32,699
Gummi Bears.
You hate Gummi Bears.

618
00:34:34,672 --> 00:34:36,196
People can change.

619
00:34:36,274 --> 00:34:37,605
No.

620
00:34:37,675 --> 00:34:39,438
And more importantly,
I hate them.

621
00:34:39,510 --> 00:34:42,274
Oh, fine.
Then I won't
offer you any.

622
00:34:45,283 --> 00:34:47,274
You manipulative bitch.

623
00:34:48,453 --> 00:34:51,547
You're not suddenly
eating healthy because
you want to.

624
00:34:51,656 --> 00:34:54,819
You're eating healthy
because you know
I don't want to.

625
00:34:54,892 --> 00:34:58,020
I've been mooching food
for 10 years,

626
00:34:58,129 --> 00:35:02,031
so either something
started bothering you
this week or you're...

627
00:35:02,133 --> 00:35:05,569
Screwing with you.
It needed to be done.

628
00:35:06,871 --> 00:35:10,136
After Amber died, I withdrew,
tried to change everything,

629
00:35:10,208 --> 00:35:13,075
hoping I'd sort it out,
find some deeper truth.

630
00:35:13,177 --> 00:35:14,735
It was a mistake.

631
00:35:14,812 --> 00:35:17,007
I should have gone back
to normal, to here and now.

632
00:35:17,081 --> 00:35:19,481
Because that's all
we can ever really
count on.

633
00:35:21,252 --> 00:35:23,379
Things need to get back
to normal in your life.

634
00:35:23,488 --> 00:35:27,652
And what could be more normal
than me screwing with you,

635
00:35:27,725 --> 00:35:29,386
and you figuring it out?

636
00:35:31,162 --> 00:35:32,652
You manipulative bitch.

637
00:35:49,847 --> 00:35:52,111
TAUB: We need to put in
a cardioverter defibrillator.

638
00:35:52,216 --> 00:35:55,208
It'll keep your heart beating
while we keep looking.

639
00:35:55,286 --> 00:35:56,412
What does that mean?

640
00:35:56,487 --> 00:35:59,456
It means, even if
we figure this out,

641
00:35:59,557 --> 00:36:03,755
you'll have to stop
protesting anywhere
not near a hospital.

642
00:36:06,430 --> 00:36:09,797
Hi. Got a few questions.

643
00:36:09,901 --> 00:36:11,266
We're about to
start doing...

644
00:36:11,335 --> 00:36:13,394
A hopefully pointless
medical procedure.

645
00:36:13,471 --> 00:36:17,567
Your life and my mojo
hang in the balance.

646
00:36:17,642 --> 00:36:22,409
Pesticides are evil,
which means that commercial
flowers are doused in evil,

647
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:25,608
but plant life is
nature's answer to evil.

648
00:36:26,417 --> 00:36:28,112
So you have a garden.

649
00:36:28,186 --> 00:36:30,086
No. We live in
an apartment.

650
00:36:32,123 --> 00:36:33,351
A window box then?

651
00:36:33,424 --> 00:36:34,550
No.

652
00:36:36,561 --> 00:36:37,653
Potted plants?

653
00:36:37,728 --> 00:36:38,922
Nothing.
The commercial
growers...

654
00:36:38,996 --> 00:36:40,793
Yeah, they're evil.
Yeah, got it.

655
00:36:40,898 --> 00:36:43,924
House, I really don't think
we have time for this.

656
00:36:46,671 --> 00:36:48,502
Your marriage sucks.

657
00:36:50,741 --> 00:36:52,106
Thank you.

658
00:36:52,743 --> 00:36:55,303
All marriages suck.
Your marriage sucks.

659
00:36:55,413 --> 00:36:57,074
No.
I love her.

660
00:36:57,682 --> 00:37:00,173
He loves a tree in Oregon
more than he loves you,

661
00:37:00,284 --> 00:37:01,751
but he can't have
sex with it.

662
00:37:01,819 --> 00:37:04,185
Unless it's
that slutty oak
outside Portland.

663
00:37:04,288 --> 00:37:06,188
You want to get
to your point?

664
00:37:06,257 --> 00:37:07,519
She's had enough.

665
00:37:07,625 --> 00:37:10,617
She's gonna leave,
maybe she's just not
putting out, whatever.

666
00:37:10,695 --> 00:37:12,822
You gotta make it right.
Right away.

667
00:37:12,930 --> 00:37:16,422
You gotta compromise
that precious flower
principle.

668
00:37:17,702 --> 00:37:18,930
Never.

669
00:37:21,505 --> 00:37:22,563
Once.

670
00:37:27,478 --> 00:37:30,379
Three weeks ago.
Our anniversary.

671
00:37:30,448 --> 00:37:33,042
I missed the dinner
to be at that rally.

672
00:37:33,150 --> 00:37:37,052
You planned it for months.
You were mad, really mad.

673
00:37:37,788 --> 00:37:41,918
I bought you flowers.
I brought them home.

674
00:37:41,993 --> 00:37:44,359
You were gone,
so was your suitcase.

675
00:37:45,696 --> 00:37:47,857
I tossed them,
bought you the earrings.

676
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,228
Roses?

677
00:37:53,638 --> 00:37:55,128
Yes.

678
00:37:55,206 --> 00:38:00,337
You have sporotrichosis.
It's an infection from
the thorn of the rose,

679
00:38:00,411 --> 00:38:04,347
which by any other name
is still a cheap marital aid.

680
00:38:04,415 --> 00:38:05,973
The flowers are
what gave me...

681
00:38:06,050 --> 00:38:08,848
Lesion on your eighth
cranial nerve knocks out
your balance,

682
00:38:08,919 --> 00:38:11,911
another on your phrenic nerve
gives you serial hiccups.

683
00:38:12,023 --> 00:38:14,253
We then spread it
to your bones and heart
with steroids

684
00:38:14,325 --> 00:38:16,225
and insulin-like
growth factor.

685
00:38:16,327 --> 00:38:18,318
Please tell us that
this is good news.

686
00:38:18,929 --> 00:38:23,195
It's good news for him,
it's good news for
future generations.

687
00:38:23,267 --> 00:38:26,395
It's crappy news for you.
He's gonna be fine.

688
00:38:26,937 --> 00:38:29,098
And he'll never
doubt himself again.

689
00:38:37,281 --> 00:38:38,771
There you go.

690
00:38:43,354 --> 00:38:45,618
Damn. I was hoping
to interrupt something.

691
00:38:48,726 --> 00:38:51,456
Your favor's repaid,
patient's cured.

692
00:38:52,129 --> 00:38:54,962
He's already packing
for another Earth Day
extravaganza next week.

693
00:38:55,066 --> 00:38:57,899
He almost died.
He can't take a few days
at home with his family?

694
00:38:57,968 --> 00:39:02,268
People only change after
a trauma if they wanted
to change before the trauma.

695
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:05,275
Or if they've watched too many
After School Specials.

696
00:39:05,343 --> 00:39:06,503
You talking about Chase?

697
00:39:06,577 --> 00:39:07,942
I'm talking about you.

698
00:39:09,146 --> 00:39:12,912
You lost husband number one,
no surprise that the death
of a colleague

699
00:39:12,983 --> 00:39:16,111
would make you question
another long-term lease.

700
00:39:16,187 --> 00:39:17,484
You teaching
commitment classes?

701
00:39:17,588 --> 00:39:19,146
'Cause I thought
you were too busy
with your lecture...

702
00:39:19,256 --> 00:39:20,780
I'm sure that was
going to be hysterical.

703
00:39:20,858 --> 00:39:22,120
Let me just give you
the Cliff Notes.

704
00:39:22,193 --> 00:39:25,526
Don't try to dump him
by dumping cases on me.

705
00:39:25,629 --> 00:39:28,655
I told you, I never
wanted to dump Chase.

706
00:39:28,766 --> 00:39:31,132
Absolutely.
You wanted him
to dump you.

707
00:39:31,202 --> 00:39:33,932
It's totally different,
much less guilt.

708
00:39:34,004 --> 00:39:37,167
Either way, you're out
of reasons to avoid him.

709
00:39:38,609 --> 00:39:40,873
Kutner was a pretty
dumb one to begin with.

710
00:39:48,552 --> 00:39:50,486
I should never have
postponed our vacation.

711
00:39:54,225 --> 00:39:55,692
I should never
have planned it.

712
00:39:59,530 --> 00:40:01,498
I found the ring
in your sock.

713
00:40:08,539 --> 00:40:11,702
I didn't want you
to propose out of some
sort of knee-jerk reaction

714
00:40:11,809 --> 00:40:13,299
to what happened
to Kutner.

715
00:40:16,414 --> 00:40:18,382
Well, I guess you don't have
to worry about that anymore.

716
00:40:18,482 --> 00:40:19,972
I'm not. I...

717
00:40:22,553 --> 00:40:26,148
I don't care how it happens,
I just want it to happen.

718
00:40:30,828 --> 00:40:32,659
Are you proposing to me?

719
00:40:33,531 --> 00:40:36,762
I'm proposing that

720
00:40:38,803 --> 00:40:40,430
you propose to me.

721
00:40:41,405 --> 00:40:45,341
After I broke up with you?
After you ruined my
planned proposal?

722
00:40:45,409 --> 00:40:46,433
You expect me to...

723
00:40:46,510 --> 00:40:48,205
I'm not expecting.

724
00:40:50,247 --> 00:40:51,714
I'm hoping.

725
00:40:56,220 --> 00:40:57,517
(SIGHS)

726
00:41:20,478 --> 00:41:21,604
Yes.

727
00:41:21,745 --> 00:41:23,736
<i>(HOUSE PLAYING JAZZ ON PIANO)</i>

728
00:42:55,539 --> 00:42:57,370
Solved another case,

729
00:42:58,709 --> 00:43:00,540
busted Wilson.

730
00:43:03,380 --> 00:43:06,645
Looks like you're not
losing it after all.
