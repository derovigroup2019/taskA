00:36:34,025 --> 00:36:35,322
He's trying to talk.

676
00:36:39,330 --> 00:36:40,820
Something
bothering you?

677
00:36:42,333 --> 00:36:45,200
If there's still
tightness in your
chest, it's expected.

678
00:36:45,303 --> 00:36:46,531
Is it your eye?

(MACHINE BEEPS THREE TIMES)

680
00:36:50,308 --> 00:36:53,744
Why's he saying "no"
three times? You only
asked one question.

681
00:36:53,811 --> 00:36:55,142
Maybe he's not
saying "no".

682
00:36:55,213 --> 00:36:56,805
Maybe he's
saying "down"?

683
00:37:01,852 --> 00:37:03,979
Are you saying that
the pain is lower?

684
00:37:04,055 --> 00:37:05,352
How low? Your leg?

685
00:37:05,556 --> 00:37:07,080

Your foot?

686
00:37:09,660 --> 00:37:10,752

Let me see now.
Yeah. His right foot.

689
00:37:15,766 --> 00:37:17,427
No bruises,
no rashes,
no cuts.

690
00:37:17,501 --> 00:37:19,867
Then there should
be no pain.

691
00:37:19,937 --> 00:37:21,837
Is it a tingling
sensation?

692
00:37:23,174 --> 00:37:24,436
Is it itching?

693
00:37:24,508 --> 00:37:25,702
(MACHINE BEEPS "YES")

694
00:37:29,113 --> 00:37:31,809
Ltchy foot means
liver failure.

695
00:37:31,882 --> 00:37:34,817
TAUB: The liver's fine,
his enzymes have been normal
since we admitted him.

696
00:37:34,885 --> 00:37:36,750
I didn't say failing,
I said failure.

697
00:37:36,821 --> 00:37:38,379
Just like you.

698
00:37:38,923 --> 00:37:41,255
Liver's like a cruise
ship taking on water.

699
00:37:41,325 --> 00:37:43,225
As it starts to sink,
it sends out an SOS.

700
00:37:43,294 --> 00:37:46,024
Only instead of radio
waves, it uses enzymes.

701
00:37:46,097 --> 00:37:48,565
The more enzymes in
the blood, the worse
the liver is.

702
00:37:48,633 --> 00:37:52,160
But once the ship has sunk,
there's no more SOS.

703
00:37:52,236 --> 00:37:55,262
You think the liver's fine,
but it's already at
the bottom of the sea.

704
00:37:55,373 --> 00:37:56,897
So dying liver
released toxins,

705
00:37:56,974 --> 00:37:59,670
damaged the nerves,
led to locked-in
syndrome.

706
00:37:59,744 --> 00:38:02,178
Now we just need to
know what's causing
the liver failure.

707
00:38:02,246 --> 00:38:05,875
Liver plus eye plus
kidney, most likely
sclerosing cholangitis.

708
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:08,748
Oh, God, if only
Taub had said that,

709
00:38:08,819 --> 00:38:10,810
it would have
been a happy ending.

710
00:38:10,888 --> 00:38:12,321
Do a biopsy to confirm.

711
00:38:16,994 --> 00:38:20,486
I'm gonna numb up the
area where we'll go in
for the punch biopsy.

712
00:38:21,399 --> 00:38:22,889
Where's the new bracelet?

713
00:38:24,302 --> 00:38:25,735
She was wearing
the bracelet?

714
00:38:25,803 --> 00:38:28,465
You didn't notice
that I was wearing it?
Because you weren't.

715
00:38:28,539 --> 00:38:29,870
He noticed
and you didn't?

716
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:31,840
If you don't like it,
it's fine, it's not
a big deal.

717
00:38:31,909 --> 00:38:33,399
THIRTEEN: I like it.
That's the point.

718
00:38:33,477 --> 00:38:37,470
I'd rather have it at home
in the jewelry box than
getting peed on at work.

719
00:38:37,548 --> 00:38:39,243
You got the patient's
urine on that arm?

720
00:38:39,317 --> 00:38:42,047
When I was putting
in the catheter. Why?

721
00:38:42,119 --> 00:38:44,747
You've got a rash.
The bracelet's real.

722
00:38:44,822 --> 00:38:47,848
I figured.
So what if the rash

723
00:38:47,925 --> 00:38:50,917
isn't just a rash,
what if it's an infection?

724
00:38:50,995 --> 00:38:53,555
If there were rats
in that basement,

725
00:38:53,631 --> 00:38:57,067
<i>then the liver failure</i>
<i>could be caused by</i>
<i>leptospirosis.</i>

726
00:38:57,134 --> 00:39:00,501
<i>Transfers through urine.</i>
<i>Rat pee to him.</i>
<i>His pee to you.</i>

727
00:39:00,571 --> 00:39:03,131
The infection would
need an entry point.

728
00:39:03,207 --> 00:39:05,539
Look for any recent
scratches, cuts.

729
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:12,906
Look. Next to
his fingernail.

730
00:39:16,253 --> 00:39:18,118
The infection
destroyed your liver,

731
00:39:18,189 --> 00:39:21,784
which released toxins
that caused the
locked-in syndrome.

732
00:39:21,859 --> 00:39:23,292
You were dying
of a paper cut.

733

<i>right this time.</i>

Let's start him on
high dose penicillin G.

735
00:39:26,630 --> 00:39:29,326
We found rats in your
buddy, Dave's basement.

736
00:39:29,433 --> 00:39:31,663
Tested positive
for leptospirosis.

737
00:39:32,470 --> 00:39:34,301
Means we're on
the right treatment.

738
00:39:35,506 --> 00:39:39,101
So try moving
a finger.

739
00:39:41,212 --> 00:39:43,578
Your brain needs
to get used to
doing its job again.

740

Try harder.

741
00:39:47,318 --> 00:39:49,513

00:40:31,162 --> 00:40:32,390
I did.

Good.

You okay with him
claiming the credit?

754
00:40:45,543 --> 00:40:47,534
It was his idea,
he saw the rash, he...

755
00:40:47,611 --> 00:40:49,511
If he did,
he would have hung

756
00:40:49,580 --> 00:40:52,549
a "Mission Accomplished"
banner in my outer office.

757
00:40:55,085 --> 00:40:56,814
Don't toy with him,
if you're going
to fire him...

758
00:40:56,887 --> 00:41:00,516
Fact that he stole your
idea means that he cares
enough to lie.

759
00:41:01,425 --> 00:41:03,222
That's all
I needed to know.

So either I have
a hole in my pocket...

764
00:41:18,776 --> 00:41:21,677
No, that's right.
I remember now.
I stole it.

765
00:41:21,745 --> 00:41:24,543

You would have thrown
her right in my face.
